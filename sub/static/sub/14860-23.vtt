00:02.544 --> 00:03.955
ALEX: Okay, why did Max
want us to meet him here?

00:04.254 --> 00:05.335
He said he finally
figured out a way

00:05.631 --> 00:07.838
to open
the unbreakable pinata.

00:08.132 --> 00:08.668
(ALEX AND PENNY SCREAMING)
JANE: Oh!

00:08.967 --> 00:09.923
Did it work?

00:10.219 --> 00:11.334
Nope.
That was dangerous.

00:12.429 --> 00:14.636
(ALL CHEERING)
ALL: Yeah!

00:14.932 --> 00:16.297
(LOUD CRASH)
(CAR ALARM BLARING)

00:16.600 --> 00:17.431
Oh.
ALEX: Oh, boy.

00:17.726 --> 00:21.219
(SHOUTING) Get the
candy! Get the candy!

00:21.522 --> 00:23.479
It seems like a lot of work
for some off-brand candy.

00:23.774 --> 00:25.435
Two musketeers?

00:25.734 --> 00:27.350
Reestie's peanut
butter klormps?

00:27.653 --> 00:28.939
Wait, I got skittles!

00:29.238 --> 00:30.694
Nope. Skin-nuls.

00:30.989 --> 00:32.525
| think there's glass
in my senior mints.

00:32.824 --> 00:33.313
And my sophomore mints.

00:34.826 --> 00:36.237
(SIGHS LOUDLY)

00:36.537 --> 00:37.868
(DOOR CLOSES)

00:38.163 --> 00:39.653
Even the ingredients
are bunk.

00:39.957 --> 00:42.198
This says it has
artishishal flavoring.

00:42.501 --> 00:43.912
(SIGHS LOUDLY)
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

00:44.211 --> 00:45.121
Al right, we'll
bite. We'll bite.

00:45.420 --> 00:46.285
ALEX: All right, fine.
PENNY: Out with it.

00:46.588 --> 00:47.874
Guys, this chef I know
really likes my truck...

00:48.173 --> 00:49.834
Don't look surprised.

00:50.133 --> 00:50.998
And he offered me
a job at Knife.

00:51.301 --> 00:52.382
Dave, congratulations!

00:52.678 --> 00:54.385
| love that restaurant.

00:54.680 --> 00:55.886
They have a lot
of food there.

00:56.181 --> 00:57.512
So you gonna take it?

00:57.808 --> 00:58.843
| don't know.
| can't decide.

00:59.142 --> 01:00.473
| mean, I love
being my own boss,

01:00.769 --> 01:02.726
but owning a food truck's
a lot of pressure.

01:03.021 --> 01:04.227
Maybe it's time
| tried my hand

01:04.522 --> 01:05.604
at the stationary
restaurant game.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.105
You mean,
the restaurant game?

01:07.401 --> 01:08.857
JANE: Okay, all right.

01:09.152 --> 01:11.359
Okay, I'd be happy to help you
make a pros and cons list, Dave.

01:11.655 --> 01:13.942
| mean, making lists
is my number one turn-on

01:14.241 --> 01:16.278
after tables of contents,
recipe conversions...

01:16.577 --> 01:18.067
Oh, my God. I'm
making a list. (GASPS)

01:18.370 --> 01:19.656
(WHISPERS)
| am so turnt.

01:19.955 --> 01:21.741
And I could review your financials
without becoming aroused.

01:22.040 --> 01:22.950
Mmm. (LAUGHS) Who am I kidding?

01:23.250 --> 01:24.490
| had me at "review."
Mmm.

01:24.793 --> 01:27.410
Guys, do I want advice from
people guessing at the future?

01:27.713 --> 01:30.330
Or do I want advice
from Tami, my psychic?

01:30.632 --> 01:32.543
Dave, for a leading
man-type,

01:32.843 --> 01:34.459
you've partake in some
really outlandish behavior.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.172
You don't understand.
Tami is the best.

01:36.471 --> 01:37.802
She helps me with
all my big decisions.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.680
What is it with you two?

01:39.975 --> 01:42.216
Alex and the ghosts.
You and the psychic.

01:42.519 --> 01:45.227
Oh, no! Do not lump me
in with this bullcorn.

01:45.522 --> 01:48.014
Ghosts are real, just
like warlocks and doulas.

01:48.317 --> 01:50.354
| am on the fence
about chupacabra.

01:50.652 --> 01:52.484
Not saying they're real,
not saying they're not.

01:52.779 --> 01:53.735
(WHISPERS)
They're real.

01:54.031 --> 01:54.771
Do you even know
what "on the fence" means?

01:56.033 --> 01:56.693
What?

02:07.628 --> 02:09.413
Are you bringing anybody
to my wedding?

02:09.713 --> 02:11.374
| only ask because | like
saying the words "my wedding."

02:11.673 --> 02:13.755
Nah, no date.
Wilson dumped me,

02:14.051 --> 02:15.416
based on some real trumped
up hygiene charges. | doubt that.

02:15.719 --> 02:16.584
Hi, guys!
(BOTH SCREAMING)

02:16.887 --> 02:17.467
What in the hell?
(LAUGHS)

02:17.763 --> 02:18.468
DAPHNE. (LAUGHS)

02:18.764 --> 02:19.720
(PANTING) Hi.

02:20.015 --> 02:21.050
Oh, my God, Penny!

02:21.350 --> 02:21.839
Is that
an engagement ring?

02:22.142 --> 02:23.974
Ah! What?

02:24.269 --> 02:26.055
This old, priceless
family heirloom

02:26.355 --> 02:28.972
that my hot fiancee's grandmother
smuggled out of the old country?

02:29.274 --> 02:30.810
| mean, I guess
"engagement ring"

02:31.109 --> 02:32.691
is the acceptable
nomenclature.

02:32.986 --> 02:33.817
Oh, my God. | saw
you four months ago.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.318
You weren't even
dating anybody.

02:35.614 --> 02:37.525
This is so exciting!
| know.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.485
A whirlwind romance.
Ah.

02:39.785 --> 02:42.152
You just knew in your gut
right away. It's so romantic.

02:42.454 --> 02:43.489
Oh, my God!
I'm so happy for you!

02:43.789 --> 02:45.871
Thank you!
You're so sweet!

02:46.166 --> 02:47.827
Can you believe
that bitch?

02:48.126 --> 02:49.787
Now I'm sorry. I'm not
hearing the bitchy part,

02:50.087 --> 02:51.953
and my bitch-dar
is pretty rock solid.

02:52.255 --> 02:54.417
You are not fooling me,
one-armed surfer girl.

02:54.716 --> 02:57.128
Max, tell her
how mean she was!

02:57.427 --> 03:00.010
I'm not great
at reading signals

03:00.305 --> 03:01.921
or understanding basic human
contact... (WRAPPER RUSTLES)

03:02.224 --> 03:04.886
But all the lady sounds she
was making seemed pretty nice.

03:05.185 --> 03:08.143
(SCOFFS)
"Whirlwind romance"?

03:08.438 --> 03:11.055
Subtext... "You're moving
too fast, you clingy tramp."

03:11.358 --> 03:13.144
She doesn't know. We're
moving at the perfect pace.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.184
Forget Daphne.

03:15.487 --> 03:17.819
You and Pete have a
lifetime to get know each other.

03:18.115 --> 03:20.402
Eh-squeeze?
Why would you say that?

03:20.701 --> 03:22.237
We already know
each other just fine,

03:22.536 --> 03:23.776
as well as
any other couple.

03:24.079 --> 03:25.319
Of course you do.
| mean...

03:25.622 --> 03:26.987
Not any couple.

03:27.290 --> 03:27.995
Brad and I have known
each other ten years.

03:28.291 --> 03:29.577
You've known Pete
four months.

03:29.876 --> 03:32.584
Oh, so now you think I'm
moving too fast? I'm not.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.040
No, I didn't say that.

03:34.339 --> 03:35.829
Oh, for your info, | bet
Pete and | know each other

03:36.133 --> 03:37.544
a lot better than
you and Brad do.

03:37.843 --> 03:40.756
Okay. Slow it down,
Jackie Joyner-crazy.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.010
You really think that?

03:42.305 --> 03:43.511
Yeah, and I'll prove it.
How?

03:43.807 --> 03:44.512
Couples game night.

03:44.808 --> 03:46.970
(GROANS)

03:47.269 --> 03:48.009
(DRAMATIC VOICE) |
thought we weren't gonna do

03:48.311 --> 03:49.642
couples game nights
anymore after...

03:49.938 --> 03:50.973
The Jane.

03:51.273 --> 03:53.139
(SHOUTING)
Yes! Yes! I win!

03:53.442 --> 03:55.683
| win! I win!

03:55.986 --> 03:59.104
Game over! I win!
Always win!

03:59.406 --> 04:00.988
Off! I win.

04:01.283 --> 04:02.239
Winners don't get touched.

04:02.534 --> 04:04.070
Ugh, what a nightmare.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.030
| wouldn't be caught dead
at that stupid game night.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.240
Good, 'cause you're
not invited. Couples only.

04:08.540 --> 04:09.075
Dead or alive, | will
be at that game night.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.621
Damn it!

04:13.920 --> 04:17.879
Oh! Disaster alert! My
psychic Tami moved to Arizona.

04:18.175 --> 04:19.336
Now how am |
supposed to decide

04:19.634 --> 04:20.999
what to do
about this job?

04:21.303 --> 04:22.714
Can't she just advise you
over the phone?

04:23.013 --> 04:25.129
She has to read
my energy in person.

04:25.432 --> 04:26.388
Don't you know
how science works?

04:26.683 --> 04:28.094
Hey. Hey.
You know I don't.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.225
| know. I'm sorry.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.227
It's just that | have to give
Knife an answer by tomorrow.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.604
Dave, most times when people
have a big decision to make,

04:34.900 --> 04:37.767
they just talk to someone
that they trust...and love.

04:38.069 --> 04:40.731
| know, but my nana's too
busy with her new boyfriend.

04:41.031 --> 04:43.523
Apparently Howard's the toast
of the retirement community.

04:43.825 --> 04:45.315
He can shower
without a chair.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.576
Right. Well, why don't you
just come to game night

04:47.871 --> 04:49.077
and try and get
some space from it?

04:49.372 --> 04:50.578
You know,
that's a pretty good idea

04:50.874 --> 04:52.160
coming from a person
who thought skymall

04:52.459 --> 04:53.949
was an actual mall
in the sky.

04:54.252 --> 04:56.368
If we can put a man
on the moon,

04:56.671 --> 04:58.503
| am pretty sure we can
put a Chico's in the clouds.

04:58.799 --> 04:59.960
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

05:00.258 --> 05:01.669
I'm really excited
for game night tonight.

05:01.968 --> 05:02.708
It should be a lot
of fun and...

05:03.011 --> 05:04.467
Pete?
Ow.

05:04.763 --> 05:08.051
This game night
is huge, okay? Huge.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.182
| mean, we're just here
to have fun...and win...

05:10.477 --> 05:11.808
And have fun by winning. Okay.

05:12.103 --> 05:12.968
Okay, then it's settled.

05:13.271 --> 05:14.932
We'll stop at nothing
to win. (CHUCKLES)

05:15.232 --> 05:17.439
And I'm so glad we brought this
bottle of merlot 'cause it's my fave,

05:17.734 --> 05:18.974
and you should know that
in case it comes up in there.

05:19.277 --> 05:19.857
Okay?
Yeah.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.393
Okay. Pete?
Huh?

05:21.696 --> 05:23.482
(CLINKING)
| love the sound

05:23.782 --> 05:25.773
your grandma's ring makes
on the bottle when I clink it.

05:26.076 --> 05:27.032
(LAUGHS) | wish I
would've met your grandma.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.533
Grandma... Tom?

05:29.663 --> 05:30.698
Grandma... Mmm?

05:31.540 --> 05:32.905
Ma... Tee... Tee...

05:33.208 --> 05:34.869
<i>Rose. Her name was Rose.
Rose!</i>

05:35.168 --> 05:35.908
Of course.
I'm so forgetful.

05:36.211 --> 05:37.793
I'm such an Aries.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.169
Do you wanna write any of
these facts about me down?

05:39.464 --> 05:40.420
Aren't you on
the cusp of Aries?

05:40.715 --> 05:41.796
"Cause you were born
on the 22nd.

05:42.092 --> 05:43.457
How'd you know that?

05:43.760 --> 05:46.047
Because I know you're into the
astrology stuff, so I looked into it.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.383
And I know your birthday
because I'm your fiancee.

05:48.682 --> 05:49.217
Aw! Mmm.
Come on.

05:51.268 --> 05:53.134
We got this.
Yeah, we do.

05:53.436 --> 05:54.892
Oh, we don't need to
knock around here. Oh.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.349
(CHANTING) Winners
win and losers lose,

05:56.648 --> 05:58.184
and alcoholics,
they just booze!

05:58.483 --> 06:00.099
They win at drinking,
that's their thing!

06:00.402 --> 06:01.688
But our thing's
always just winning!

06:01.987 --> 06:02.943
We're Brad and Jane,
let's start this game!

I'm cool.

06:09.077 --> 06:09.987
(BOTH POP LIPS)

06:10.745 --> 06:11.655
We got this.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.947
DAVE: Oh!
I'm sorry, Alex.

06:15.250 --> 06:16.490
Without Tami, | can't
even make small decisions.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.409
| got six different kinds
of chips.

06:18.712 --> 06:19.702
Well, we'll definitely
need more.

06:20.005 --> 06:21.541
But if you need help
making decisions,

06:21.840 --> 06:23.080
there's an obvious person
you can talk to.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.919
Oh, my God.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.925
The answer's been in front
of me of this whole time.

06:27.220 --> 06:27.709
Thank you!
Let's start by talking...

06:28.013 --> 06:30.380
That tarot card reader!

06:30.682 --> 06:33.640
Now it's not Tami, but sometimes
in life you gotta take chances.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.016
You know
who taught me that?

Okay, Alex and Dave
are late,

06:43.528 --> 06:44.734
but we are not gonna
wait for them. Nope.

06:45.030 --> 06:47.192
The first game is called
ready, set, couples!

06:47.490 --> 06:49.151
A fast-paced
relationship game

06:49.451 --> 06:50.987
where Brad and Jane
will kick your ass.

06:51.286 --> 06:52.026
(CHUCKLES)
Mmm!

06:53.663 --> 06:54.573
It doesn't really
say that.

06:54.873 --> 06:55.863
Then why did you
say it then?

06:56.166 --> 06:57.281
(WHISPERS) 'Cause I
wanted to. (DOOR OPENS)

06:57.584 --> 06:59.245
Look what the cat
dragged in.

| know you didn't want me at
your little couples game night,

07:02.047 --> 07:03.208
but what you
didn't count on

07:03.506 --> 07:04.996
was the extent
of my loneliness.

07:05.300 --> 07:06.415
So I am here
with my buddy Scotty.

07:07.469 --> 07:09.210
Is he straight? Yeah.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.719
Is he crazy?
Almost definitely.

07:12.015 --> 07:16.009
But does he do an amazingly
spot-on Condoleezza Rice impression?

The United Nations of farts.

07:18.355 --> 07:19.641
No, he does not.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.101
All right, whatever.
Sit down. You can play.

07:21.399 --> 07:22.981
All right, round one.

favorite color, and we guess.

07:30.408 --> 07:31.489
All right, babe.

07:31.785 --> 07:32.741
(JANE CHUCKLES)
You have a lovely home.

07:33.036 --> 07:34.652
Okay. Here we go.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.537
Pete...

07:36.831 --> 07:37.912
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
What's Penny's favorite color?

07:38.208 --> 07:39.494
(PENNY SIGHS) Okay.
I'm gonna say... Purple.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.581
(SHOUTS) Yes! Eat it.

07:42.879 --> 07:43.994
| was referring to the
spinach dip that I brought.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.253
And please help yourself.
But also, eat it!

07:45.548 --> 07:47.130
And that one
is just pure trash talk.

07:47.425 --> 07:48.415
Also, slap it.

07:48.718 --> 07:49.298
(NASAL VOICE) Ow!
Ah!

07:49.594 --> 07:50.550
Okay, our turn.

07:50.845 --> 07:52.301
Max's favorite color
is red.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.554
Hello. Scotty.
(SCOTTY LAUGHS)

07:54.849 --> 07:56.305
Nailed it!
How did you know that?

07:56.601 --> 07:58.808
Oh, I know everything
about you, Max. (CHUCKLES)

07:59.104 --> 08:00.390
(MAX LAUGHS) What,
are you stalking me?

08:00.689 --> 08:03.351
We prefer the term
"Obsessive American." Oh.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.106
And Brad's favorite color
is green,

08:05.402 --> 08:07.109
so next question.

08:07.404 --> 08:08.360
(HIGH PITCHED VOICE ) Um...

08:08.655 --> 08:09.269
(EXHALES)

08:11.449 --> 08:12.109
It's blue.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.201
(LOWERED VOICE)
Those are different colors.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.327
Janey, don't worry.
You're gonna get it...ow!

08:19.708 --> 08:21.073

08:21.376 --> 08:22.286

08:22.585 --> 08:23.245
(NORMAL VOICE)
The Jane.

08:23.545 --> 08:24.125
(EXHALES)

08:27.090 --> 08:29.172
Hey, forgetti
and meatballs,

08:29.467 --> 08:31.504
Jason Bourne called, and he says
he remembers more stuff than you.

08:31.803 --> 08:33.965
Why did you say that
your favorite color is blue?

08:34.264 --> 08:35.924
When we first met, | said
my favorite color was green,

08:36.224 --> 08:37.429
and you said,
"Me, too."

08:37.726 --> 08:39.308
Early on, | realized that
what turns you on the most

08:39.602 --> 08:40.467
is people agreeing
with you.

08:40.770 --> 08:41.885
And you know
| likes my sex.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.179
(CHUCKLES)
Loves me some smoosh.

08:44.482 --> 08:45.893
(LOWERED VOICE) All right, well,
you ever wanna get that smoosh again?

08:46.192 --> 08:47.148
(WHISPERS) | want
that smoosh. Yeah?

08:47.444 --> 08:48.980
Yeah. Well, they are
laughing at us out there.

08:50.155 --> 08:51.441
Do you... (CHUCKLES)

08:51.740 --> 08:53.071
Do you know what
you're calling Pete? What?

08:53.366 --> 08:55.528
The new Brad.
The new Brad?

08:55.827 --> 08:56.532
BRAD: What?
(MAX AND SCOTTY LAUGH)

08:56.828 --> 08:57.909
This Brad's still fresh!

08:58.204 --> 08:59.694
Are you?
Fresh to death!

08:59.998 --> 09:00.658

09:06.671 --> 09:07.502
Okay, gang, here we go.

09:11.718 --> 09:12.549
Ooh!

09:12.844 --> 09:14.209
We got this...

09:14.512 --> 09:15.217
JANE: Oh, yes. (SINGSONGY)
In the doggie bag.

09:15.513 --> 09:16.469
Mm-hmm!
(LAUGHS)

09:16.765 --> 09:17.755
(WHISPERS)
You're not me, Pete.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.048
What's that?
(SCOFFS) See?

09:19.350 --> 09:20.385
Can't even hear like me.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.972
All right, Penny, what's
Pete's favorite food?

09:23.271 --> 09:24.181
(SNAPS FINGERS)
Okay, okay, okay. Uh...

09:24.481 --> 09:25.266
| got this! I got this!
Pork pork.

09:26.775 --> 09:28.357
Yes, it's pork pork!
(PENNY SQUEALS)

09:28.651 --> 09:30.813
Something my mom made.
It's two pork chops.

09:31.112 --> 09:31.817
Give a tiny tap!
(HUMS) Yes!

09:32.113 --> 09:32.978
(MOUTHS WORDS)

09:33.281 --> 09:35.147
Okay, I am gonna guess...

09:35.450 --> 09:37.157
Your favorite food
is dolphin meat.

09:37.452 --> 09:39.784
D'oh! So close.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.070
Reestie's
peanut butter klormps.

09:41.372 --> 09:43.113
And my favorite food,
of course,

09:43.416 --> 09:45.248
is lemon sage chicken

09:45.543 --> 09:47.534
and yukon gold potatoes

09:47.837 --> 09:49.703
with braised kale.

09:50.006 --> 09:50.791

(SQUEALS)

09:51.508 --> 09:53.124

09:53.426 --> 09:55.417
Yeah! I put "soup.”
(INHALES DEEPLY)

09:55.720 --> 09:56.209
(WHISPERS)
You put what?

09:57.097 --> 09:57.757
Oops.

09:58.556 --> 09:59.136
(SCOFFS)

10:00.433 --> 10:01.798
I'm having second thoughts.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.092
| mean, this place
is kind of weird.

10:03.394 --> 10:05.135
Tami didn't use
any of this stuff.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.179
We got crystal balls, voodoo
dolls and chicken bones?

10:07.482 --> 10:09.143
No one uses
those anymore.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.149
(MOUTH FULL) The
chicken bones are mine.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.934
(BEADS RATTLE) Thank you
for coming. Where shall we begin?

10:13.238 --> 10:14.399
With us leaving.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.233
I'm sorry. | don't know
you. You don't know me.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.115
But I think we both know
that this isn't gonna work.

10:18.409 --> 10:19.695
So... (CHUCKLES)
Are you sure?

10:19.994 --> 10:21.905
| sense that you have
a big decision to make.

10:22.205 --> 10:22.945
Oh, you're good.

10:23.248 --> 10:24.909
Hmm? (SMACKS LIPS)

10:25.208 --> 10:27.950
The key to couples' jenga
is a steady hand.

10:28.253 --> 10:29.835
And the key
to a steady hand

10:30.130 --> 10:32.417
is stealing
Parkinson's medication

10:32.715 --> 10:34.456
from your
landlady's aunt. Ah!

10:34.759 --> 10:37.751
The other key is a
couple completely in sync.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.261
Mmm.
Mmm.

look at that?

11:37.572 --> 11:38.812
Pete and I win! Yes!

11:40.867 --> 11:42.949

America's golden couple...

I'm sorry.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.292
You know what?
That's on me.

11:53.588 --> 11:55.249
Jane, I'd like to introduce
you to your husband Brad.

11:55.548 --> 11:56.629
He's a real nice guy. He stands
about 6'2". (LAUGHS) Yes.

11:56.925 --> 11:59.041
Yep. We get it.
We get it.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.675
(LAUGHS)
Penny, you won. Yeah.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.007
Yeah, my husband and I are
completely incompatible.

12:03.306 --> 12:05.263
Yay! Cat's out of the bag!

(NEW AGE MUSIC PLAYING)

12:15.318 --> 12:17.150
The wheel of fortune.

12:17.445 --> 12:19.277

you should take a risk

12:19.572 --> 12:20.937
and go work at Knife.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.949
Or the wheel represents
the wheel of my truck,

12:24.244 --> 12:25.985

make my fortune.

12:26.287 --> 12:27.777

what I said it means.

12:29.207 --> 12:31.073
My name's not Ann.
It's Magic Ann.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.333
Magic Ann? Really?

12:33.628 --> 12:34.038
Your mom named you that?

12:35.880 --> 12:36.711
Let's see what
the next card says.

12:38.508 --> 12:40.215
Ace of swords.

12:40.510 --> 12:41.545
This pretty clearly
implies...

12:41.844 --> 12:43.380
Let me field
this one, Annie.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.387

represents me,

12:45.682 --> 12:47.548
working alone at my truck,
ridin' solo.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.137
It's literally
a big Knife,

scientist to see that.

13:01.155 --> 13:03.271
My last psychic Tami would never
have treated old Dave this way.

13:03.574 --> 13:06.862
Wait. You're Dave Rose.
You drove Tami out of town.

13:07.161 --> 13:09.072
She took early retirement
because of you!

It's time for you to go.

13:12.875 --> 13:13.580
We'll go when
we're good and ready.

a single question about me!

Did he cheat? On you?

15:17.792 --> 15:19.874
On a test?
On his diet?

15:20.169 --> 15:21.500
Of course he didn't. | mean,
look at the guy. He's a knockout.

15:21.796 --> 15:22.752
He didn't do anything.
| mean, |I...

15:23.047 --> 15:23.912
(DOOR OPENS)

15:27.468 --> 15:28.048
(PILLS RATTLE)

15:32.390 --> 15:33.880
(DOOR CLOSES)

15:34.183 --> 15:35.469
Look, anyway,
Pete didn't do anything.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.179
He's the perfect guy.
It's just...

15:38.771 --> 15:39.681
He's not perfect for me.

15:39.981 --> 15:40.891
(DOOR OPENS)

15:42.275 --> 15:43.185
Oh. Max.

15:44.527 --> 15:46.359
You were worried
about me, too.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.895
Uh... Yeah.
Super worried.

15:50.074 --> 15:51.280
Penny's breaking up
with Pete.

15:51.576 --> 15:53.158
(LOWERED VOICE)
What? No!

15:53.453 --> 15:54.909
Oh, man!
That's terrible.

15:55.204 --> 15:56.319
Tell me about it
really quickly.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.829
Well...
Oh, Pen! Bummer.

15:59.125 --> 15:59.455
You're probably just
scared about the wedding.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.081
Good talk.

16:01.377 --> 16:03.243
No, the wedding's the one
thing I'm not nervous about.

16:03.546 --> 16:05.128
It...it's the 40, 50, 60
years in the future... Hmm.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.080
That I can't imagine.

16:09.010 --> 16:10.091
| don't have
what you two have,

16:12.221 --> 16:12.835
and I wanna wait
for that.

16:14.348 --> 16:15.930
Mmm.
Oh, honey.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.681
My favorite color is you.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.014
Mmm, that made no sense,
but I love it.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.179
Mmm.
Mmm.

16:22.482 --> 16:23.938
And it's green from now
on. (WHISPERS) Okay.

16:24.233 --> 16:25.439
(DOOR OPENS)
PETE: Guys?

16:25.735 --> 16:26.645
You left me
alone with Scotty.

16:26.944 --> 16:28.605
Now he's trying
to sell me speed,

16:28.905 --> 16:29.940
but I think
it might be a centrum.

16:31.199 --> 16:32.234
Pete, we need to talk.

16:33.242 --> 16:33.982
Okay.

16:36.579 --> 16:38.365
(DOOR CLOSES)

16:38.664 --> 16:39.153
It sucks for those kids,
huh?

16:40.541 --> 16:42.248
Max!
Max.

16:42.543 --> 16:43.624
What? I'm just sitting
here with a towel on my lap.

16:44.212 --> 16:44.917
Oh.

16:46.464 --> 16:47.454
Everyone has
abandoned me...

16:47.757 --> 16:49.964
My psychic,
a tarot card reader.

16:50.259 --> 16:52.341
But at least I know now
what I have to do... Talk to...

16:52.637 --> 16:53.422
To your girlfriend!
A mentalist!

16:53.721 --> 16:55.132
Dave, stop!

16:55.431 --> 16:56.637
You don't need all these
people. You have me.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.507
I'm your person.

16:59.810 --> 17:02.097
Oh. I'm sorry. I...

17:03.564 --> 17:05.146
Of course.
Well, help me.

17:05.441 --> 17:06.852
Tell me what to do.
Nah.

17:07.151 --> 17:08.561
What?
From what I've seen today,

17:08.861 --> 17:11.272
you know what you want,
okay? But you gotta say it.

17:11.571 --> 17:12.653
You can't make
someone else tell you.

17:14.325 --> 17:16.031
What do you want?
| wanna keep my truck.

17:16.327 --> 17:17.532
There it is.
You knew.

17:17.828 --> 17:18.363
Oh.
(LAUGHS)

17:19.247 --> 17:20.612
Okay.
Right?

17:20.915 --> 17:22.326
Okay, so what
you're saying is that

17:22.625 --> 17:25.742
| have been my
own psychic all along.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.662
Yeah, Dave.
You're your own psychic.

17:28.965 --> 17:31.502
You know, you're a lot smarter
than people give you credit for.

17:32.343 --> 17:33.299
Thank you.

17:36.180 --> 17:36.794
Wow.

17:38.099 --> 17:38.839
Uh...

17:41.561 --> 17:42.221
Okay.

17:44.063 --> 17:48.352
Pete, you are such
a great guy,

17:48.651 --> 17:49.891
and you deserve to
marry someone who's sure.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.437
I'm so sorry.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.447
And I'm even sorrier
that my friends

17:56.742 --> 17:57.527
are watching
from the deck.

18:02.707 --> 18:03.868
(INAUDIBLE)

18:04.166 --> 18:05.076
God, why did
we come out here?

18:05.376 --> 18:07.617
Early spring in Chicago
is really just winter.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.957
Ah, I wish we could hear
what they're saying.

18:10.256 --> 18:12.463
| can read lips. In my
early 20s, | was deaf.

18:12.758 --> 18:13.623
Here's what
they're saying...

18:13.926 --> 18:16.167
(IMITATES BRITISH WOMAN)
Oh! Scotty is the greatest.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.711
You should have
bought pills from him.

18:19.015 --> 18:19.971
SCOTTY: (DEEP VOICE)
Yeah, that guy seems pretty cool.

18:20.266 --> 18:21.552
What's his deal?

18:21.851 --> 18:23.182
He seems like he'd be
a good extra set of hands

18:23.477 --> 18:24.012
to bring into
our relationship.

18:25.062 --> 18:26.644
Ooh.
MAX: Scotty...

18:26.939 --> 18:31.058
SCOTTY: Squishy. Your
impressions are getting amazing.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.145
Thanks, brah.
MAX: (LAUGHS) Yeah!

18:36.407 --> 18:38.273
Okay, well...

18:38.576 --> 18:39.486
| guess this is it.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.870
It's, uh, it's
a little awkward. The...

18:48.169 --> 18:49.284
Of course.
Your grandmother's ring.

18:49.587 --> 18:50.827
Yes.

(SIGHS DEEPLY)

18:54.091 --> 18:55.877
(CHUCKLES)

18:56.177 --> 18:58.714
Does not seem to
wanna come off. So sorry.

18:59.013 --> 18:59.844
| think you're pushing it
down. You need to slide it up.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.504
Oh! That did the trick.

19:01.807 --> 19:02.387
Yeah. Here you go.
(CHUCKLES)

19:06.562 --> 19:08.018
Good-bye, Penny.
Good-bye, Pete.

Oh, thank you, guys.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.240
Scotty, please do not
touch me there.

19:25.539 --> 19:28.156
Oh, I'm sorry. | thought
tush was in play.

19:28.459 --> 19:30.621
Guys... Big news! Maybe
the biggest news of the night...

19:30.920 --> 19:32.536
Nay, the year.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.420
I'm keeping
my food truck.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.251
And in even bigger news,
I'm a psychic.

19:36.550 --> 19:37.210
Dave...
(GROANS) Oh.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.966
Not the best time.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.843
Oh, something's going
on, right? | could feel it. I...

19:41.138 --> 19:42.970
Penny just... Oh, it
has to do with Penny!

19:43.265 --> 19:44.630
I've got it!
| can figure it out.

19:44.934 --> 19:46.800
Penny is having
Pete's love child,

19:47.103 --> 19:48.844
and they've never been
stronger. Mmm-hmm.

19:49.146 --> 19:51.433
No! You're becoming
a doctor.

BREAKS) Close. Pete and I broke up.

19:53.067 --> 19:54.307
Oh, my God, Penny.
Are you okay?

19:55.111 --> 19:56.101
No.

19:56.404 --> 19:57.565
(WHISPERS) Gosh.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.024
Not in play. Not in
play. For anyone?

19:59.323 --> 19:59.733
JANE: For anyone here.
DAVE: Jeez, Scotty!

20:00.658 --> 20:01.193
| need a drink.

20:02.243 --> 20:03.404
I'm so glad I have you.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.159
| would like to raise
a toast to you guys.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.912
Oh, no. Oh, no!
(SNIFFLES)

20:08.207 --> 20:10.198

clink of the ring on the bottle.

20:10.501 --> 20:11.832
Oh, God!
MAX: Hey.

20:12.128 --> 20:13.869
Hey! We are not gonna
do this. (WHIMPERS)

20:14.171 --> 20:16.788
We are not gonna cry.
We are gonna celebrate,

20:17.091 --> 20:18.627
because what you
just did was make

20:18.926 --> 20:21.668
an incredibly strong
and brave decision.

20:21.971 --> 20:23.882
Okay, you're a big girl
now, and I'm proud of you.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.097
We're all proud of you.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.475

Tush in play!

20:36.152 --> 20:37.563

20:37.862 --> 20:39.193
Aah! (LAUGHS)
ALL: Tush in play!

20:41.866 --> 20:42.606
How you doin', Pen?

20:42.908 --> 20:44.023
I'm fine.

20:44.326 --> 20:45.566
| mean, it's Pete
you should worry about.

20:45.870 --> 20:47.861
| dumped him two months
before our wedding.

20:48.164 --> 20:49.404
Who does that?

20:49.707 --> 20:50.788
Pete will be fine,
all right?

20:51.083 --> 20:52.039
Two months is great.

20:52.334 --> 20:53.790
Hell, even two weeks
is great.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.747
At least at two weeks you
can get your tux deposit back.

20:56.046 --> 20:56.660
(MOUTH FULL)
Even a week is good.

20:56.964 --> 20:59.205
Even 15 minutes
is good.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.419
Yeah, Penny, as long as you
don't walk all the way down the aisle

21:01.719 --> 21:02.880
and then up to the altar
and then realize...

21:03.179 --> 21:03.714
Oh, I did that.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.591
Oh. God, I suck.

21:06.891 --> 21:08.848
No, no. Hey,
it's not your fault.

21:09.143 --> 21:10.850
| should've
seen it coming.

21:11.145 --> 21:13.102
If only I'd been in touch
with my gift back then...

21:13.397 --> 21:15.809
Ew. That's it for
me. Okey dokey.

21:16.108 --> 21:16.973
Okay, see you, guys.

21:18.736 --> 21:20.272
| knew that was
gonna happen, too.

21:20.571 --> 21:23.404
But they'll be back
in three, two, one.

21:23.699 --> 21:24.609
| forgot my purse.
What?

21:24.909 --> 21:25.774
JANE: I forgot
to throw in.

21:26.076 --> 21:26.941
PENNY: Bye, guys.

21:27.244 --> 21:28.279
Sorry about
that, weirdos.

21:28.579 --> 21:29.785
(STRAINED VOICE)
Yeah. Ouch.

21:30.080 --> 21:30.660
