00:01.702 --> 00:04.605
[dramatic music]

00:04.638 --> 00:10.378
*

00:10.411 --> 00:13.547
- My name is Tom Kinder.
I'm 44 years old.

00:13.581 --> 00:16.150
I have always loved swords.

00:16.184 --> 00:19.153
Dungeons and Dragons,
"The Lord of the Rings,"

00:19.187 --> 00:22.190
I got into those things
because they had swords.

00:22.223 --> 00:24.292
I like swords.

00:24.325 --> 00:26.527
- My name's Andrew Taycach.
I'm 38 years old,

00:26.560 --> 00:28.462
and I'm from West Newton,
Pennsylvania.

00:28.496 --> 00:31.699
I think I made my first knife
when I was eight or nine.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.834
Blacksmithing and bladesmithing
are things

00:33.867 --> 00:35.536
that you get in trouble
for as a kid,

00:35.569 --> 00:38.139
you know, playing with fire,
smashing things.

00:38.172 --> 00:40.208
And you can get
away with it now.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.743
- My name is Chad Hollar.
I'm 44 years old.

00:42.776 --> 00:45.213
Everything I do,
I try to challenge myself.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.780
Joining the Marine
Corps was a challenge.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.816
Becoming a deputy sheriff
was a challenge.

00:48.849 --> 00:50.184
Blacksmithing is a challenge.

00:50.218 --> 00:51.752
But I'm a pretty smart guy,

00:51.785 --> 00:53.821
and sometimes I can
pull off some things

00:53.854 --> 00:55.656
that even amaze myself.

00:55.689 --> 00:59.427
- My name is Tim Shoal.
I'm 63 years old.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.162
I've always loved knives.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.597
But I would love
to do voice-overs.

01:03.631 --> 01:05.499
I can do a Scottish voice.

01:05.533 --> 01:07.668
I can do Australian
if you want me to.

01:07.701 --> 01:10.471
I can do an Arkansas accent.

01:10.504 --> 01:13.474
But I like bladesmithing
because I can do it my way,

01:13.507 --> 01:17.478
and it makes me very happy.

01:17.511 --> 01:20.181
- Bladesmiths, welcome
to the Forge.

01:20.214 --> 01:21.815
You're here for three
rounds of edged weapon

01:21.849 --> 01:23.484
making competition
designed to test

01:23.517 --> 01:25.419
every aspect of your skills,

01:25.453 --> 01:27.321
all in front of our panel
of expert judges.

01:27.355 --> 01:28.589
They're the ones that determine

01:28.622 --> 01:30.591
which of you
gets the $10,000

01:30.624 --> 01:32.826
and the title
of "Forged in Fire" champion.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.328
Let's meet them now.

01:34.362 --> 01:36.397
ABS master smith J. Neilson.

01:36.430 --> 01:39.433
Historic weapons re-creation
specialist David Baker.

01:39.467 --> 01:42.403
Last, edged weapon specialist
Doug Marcaida.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.138
If you look down at your anvils,

01:44.172 --> 01:46.874
you'll see a 5160 bar
stock of steel.

01:46.907 --> 01:49.377
Now, today, you will
not be forging blades

01:49.410 --> 01:50.878
in your signature style.

01:50.911 --> 01:54.582
Instead, you'll be
forging Bowies.

01:54.615 --> 01:57.618
But there's a twist.
In the second round,

01:57.651 --> 02:00.754
we'll be requiring you
to add a D-guard to your Bowie,

02:00.788 --> 02:03.191
so make sure they're
set up appropriately.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.458
- When he said that we had
to make a D-guard,

02:04.492 --> 02:06.394
that got me a little worried.

02:06.427 --> 02:08.562
I can't just make the knife
and then figure out

02:08.596 --> 02:10.464
the D-guard later.
It's almost a chess game.

02:10.498 --> 02:12.700
I've got to be thinking two
or three moves ahead.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.602
- Additionally,
in the second round,

02:14.635 --> 02:16.370
you'll be putting handles
on your blades,

02:16.404 --> 02:18.272
turning them into
fully-functional weapons.

02:18.306 --> 02:20.308
Your finished Bowies
will be tested for strength

02:20.341 --> 02:22.743
and durability in a nail chop,

02:22.776 --> 02:25.746
and for edge retention
in a beef slice.

02:25.779 --> 02:27.548
You have ten minutes
to work on your designs.

02:27.581 --> 02:30.351
You will have three hours
to forge your blades.

02:30.384 --> 02:33.721
Your ten-minute design
window starts now.

02:33.754 --> 02:36.290
[rock music]

02:36.324 --> 02:38.859
- I'm making a spear-point Bowie
with a D-guard.

02:38.892 --> 02:40.228
It's just a classic,

02:40.261 --> 02:42.496
historically correct Bowie knife

02:42.530 --> 02:45.266
that was carried
during the Civil War.

02:45.299 --> 02:47.268
I'm pretty confident,
but anything can happen.

02:47.301 --> 02:48.636
*

02:48.669 --> 02:50.604
- Let's get into the specifics.

02:50.638 --> 02:54.342
The Bowie should have
a clip point with a false edge.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.544
It can be straight,
it can be rounded.

02:56.577 --> 02:59.313
- Yeah. If it's just
dropped and left flat,

02:59.347 --> 03:01.582
then it's not a Bowie.

03:01.615 --> 03:03.551
- My design is a traditional
style Bowie with a clip point.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.586
The challenge is difficult

03:05.619 --> 03:07.388
because I have never made
a D-guard before.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.257
So I am a bit nervous about it.

03:09.290 --> 03:11.625
*

03:11.659 --> 03:15.996
- I'm excited about using
flat bar 5160, a known steel,

03:16.029 --> 03:18.266
but it's still
a thick piece of steel

03:18.299 --> 03:21.001
that I'm gonna have to work
really hard to form and to move.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.437
My design is basically
a Bowie knife,

03:23.471 --> 03:24.872
with a little bit
of a drop point to it

03:24.905 --> 03:27.241
with a false edge on top.

03:27.275 --> 03:29.543
It's been working since Jim
Bowie came up with that design.

03:29.577 --> 03:30.811
If it's not broke, don't fix it.

03:30.844 --> 03:33.414
*

03:33.447 --> 03:35.483
- I've heard it said
that the Bowie knife

03:35.516 --> 03:37.485
is the most versatile canvas

03:37.518 --> 03:40.688
for a knife maker
to express himself on.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.690
Well, I'm a sword maker.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.558
I'm making a standard bowie

03:44.592 --> 03:47.261
with a clip point
and an integral guard.

03:47.295 --> 03:49.330
I'm most nervous about
being able

03:49.363 --> 03:51.465
to compete
with the other smiths.

03:51.499 --> 03:53.934
I haven't made nearly
as many knives as they have,

03:53.967 --> 03:55.636
because I focus on swords.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.971
So I feel that my competitors

03:58.005 --> 04:00.608
are really making me
the underdog.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.776
- Bladesmiths, this design
period is now closed.

04:02.810 --> 04:05.613
Your three-hour forge
time starts now.

04:05.646 --> 04:08.682
*

04:08.716 --> 04:10.050
- Tim's ready to go fishing
after he gets done

04:10.083 --> 04:11.552
making his knife.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.321
- I always forge in this hat.

04:13.354 --> 04:15.623
Just to keep sparks
and stuff out of my eyes.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.858
I call it my lucky hat, though.

04:17.891 --> 04:20.594
Coming to weld.

04:20.628 --> 04:23.331
I don't like tongs.

04:23.364 --> 04:27.401
So, first thing I'm gonna do
is try to weld a handle on it.

04:27.435 --> 04:29.603
I hate tongs.
[laughs]

04:29.637 --> 04:31.905
*

04:31.939 --> 04:37.578
It's fairly thick, so I'm gonna
start thinning the steel out.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.880
Hot stuff, guys. Hot stuff.

04:39.913 --> 04:43.484
*

04:43.517 --> 04:45.386
- Oh!
- Not a good weld.

04:45.419 --> 04:47.621
Oh, bleep.
[laughing]

04:47.655 --> 04:49.690
I'm in trouble.

04:49.723 --> 04:51.925
I'm not gonna try to weld
the handle back on.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.927
I need to get this done.

04:53.961 --> 04:57.631
I'll go with my nemesis,
the tongs, and bite the bullet.

04:57.665 --> 05:00.501
*

05:00.534 --> 05:02.403
I hate tongs.

05:02.436 --> 05:04.738
- He really ought
to shape those tongs.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.540
- Put the tongs in the forge,

05:06.574 --> 05:10.010
get 'em hot, form 'em
right to the steel.

05:10.043 --> 05:13.113
- My plan for the round is to
try to get my stock broke down

05:13.146 --> 05:15.883
and my blade forged out
as quickly as possible,

05:15.916 --> 05:19.052
and I'll just cut that leftover
material for the guard.

05:19.086 --> 05:22.456
When I see that I have
all this power equipment to use,

05:22.490 --> 05:25.759
I'm using it to the best
of my advantage.

05:25.793 --> 05:29.530
But I just feel
that if it's there, use it.

05:29.563 --> 05:32.099
That's why they invented
the wheel.

05:32.132 --> 05:34.067
- I want to see who's gonna try
and forge

05:34.101 --> 05:35.803
their tip out
of the square stock,

05:35.836 --> 05:37.070
or who's gonna cut
an angle into it

05:37.104 --> 05:38.839
and pre-form their tip.

05:38.872 --> 05:41.409
It's a lot faster
to pre-form it.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.877
- So next, I break
the stock down.

05:43.911 --> 05:45.679
I just cut it at an angle

05:45.713 --> 05:48.516
so that I already have
some of my point formed.

05:48.549 --> 05:51.118
*

05:51.151 --> 05:53.387
- The first thing I do is get
that thick

05:53.421 --> 05:55.022
piece of steel in the forge.

05:55.055 --> 05:56.857
*

05:56.890 --> 05:58.626
I pretty much grew up
in the woods,

05:58.659 --> 06:00.027
used a lot of knives,
and I kind of feel

06:00.060 --> 06:02.029
that connection
with Jim Bowie, I guess.

06:02.062 --> 06:03.864
So, just kind of going
with the Bowie-style knife

06:03.897 --> 06:05.833
that I know would work for me.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.068
- They might think, hey,
I'm making a Bowie.

06:08.101 --> 06:09.637
I do this all the time.

06:09.670 --> 06:10.938
How many guys make
D-guards all the time?

06:10.971 --> 06:12.940
- Yep.

06:12.973 --> 06:15.008
- That's wt makes
this challenge so complicated.

06:15.042 --> 06:20.147
It's, are you gonna do anything
to set you up for round two?

06:20.180 --> 06:22.115
- I'm not familiar
with that forge.

06:22.149 --> 06:24.117
It's slightly different
than mine at home,

06:24.151 --> 06:26.086
and it just seems to be
taking a really long time

06:26.119 --> 06:27.655
to be heating up.

06:27.688 --> 06:30.057
*

06:30.090 --> 06:31.859
This is the worst part,
waiting for it to heat up.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.126
- Yeah, really.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.828
*

06:34.862 --> 06:36.764
- Oh, yeah,
now we're getting hot.

06:36.797 --> 06:38.666
I just got to hit that press,
and just let the press

06:38.699 --> 06:40.901
do what the press is gonna do.

06:40.934 --> 06:44.938
My wife Maria and I joke all the
time about how average I am.

06:44.972 --> 06:47.441
Average height, average weight,
average shoe size.

06:47.475 --> 06:49.477
The only thing
that makes me stand out

06:49.510 --> 06:51.144
is how loud I can yell.

06:51.178 --> 06:53.146
I guarantee that
I can out-yell Wil Willis.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.648
Bladesmiths!

06:54.682 --> 06:56.450
You have 30 minutes remaining!

06:56.484 --> 06:59.186
- Bladesmiths!
30 minutes has elapsed!

06:59.219 --> 07:01.889
- [laughing]

07:01.922 --> 07:04.124
- So I'm making a Bowie knife
with a D-guard.

07:04.157 --> 07:06.994
That's cool.
I can do that.

07:07.027 --> 07:09.897
Whoo-wee,
that's slow to heat up.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.565
That's all right. It's a big,
thick piece of steel.

07:11.599 --> 07:13.233
Once it gets hot,
it'll stay hot.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.802
*

07:14.835 --> 07:16.470
I've given myself an hour

07:16.504 --> 07:18.171
and a half to get
that billet prepped

07:18.205 --> 07:20.073
and ready to make a knife.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.810
And then I just go to town
with the hammers

07:22.843 --> 07:24.978
and knock the blade out.

07:25.012 --> 07:29.783
Big old piece of steel.
Glad we got big machines for it.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.685
So I hammer the handle out.

07:31.719 --> 07:34.922
It gets three inches wide
pretty quick.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.658
- Now if Tom can pull that
D-guard out of there,

07:37.691 --> 07:39.893
stretch it out
and not overheat it,

07:39.927 --> 07:42.763
he could really set himself up
wonderfully for round two.

07:42.796 --> 07:45.265
- You have three hours
to forge your blade.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.000
But you can use
some of that time

07:47.034 --> 07:48.902
to get started on a guard.

07:48.936 --> 07:50.804
- They can use the scrap
steel out there,

07:50.838 --> 07:52.806
or the excess
of their original bar.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.876
*

07:55.909 --> 07:57.911
- When you're setting a guard up
on a knife,

07:57.945 --> 08:00.047
you've got to have
square shoulders,

08:00.080 --> 08:04.618
because it lines the guard up
perfectly with the ricasso area.

08:04.652 --> 08:07.688
And lo and behold,
I looked on the table,

08:07.721 --> 08:10.090
and there was
a shoulder filing jig.

08:10.123 --> 08:13.661
So I said, "hot dog."
[laughing]

08:13.694 --> 08:16.997
I grabbed that and filed
my shoulders dead flat.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.566
*

08:18.599 --> 08:20.601
Dead even where I wanted to be.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.736
*

08:22.770 --> 08:23.937
- I'm trying to remove
some hammer marks

08:23.971 --> 08:25.706
that I have in my blade.

08:25.739 --> 08:27.908
*

08:27.941 --> 08:30.611
- Andrew's shape is beautiful,
but it's lean Bowie.

08:30.644 --> 08:33.581
I'd just like to see him
draw it out more.

08:33.614 --> 08:36.216
- I got my stock broke down
for my guard already.

08:36.249 --> 08:38.852
I made it out of the same billet
as the blade.

08:38.886 --> 08:41.755
While I'm working
on the blade, I get that hot.

08:41.789 --> 08:44.024
*

08:44.057 --> 08:46.727
And try to go back
and forth between the two.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.129
*

08:49.162 --> 08:51.565
I'm heating both sides evenly,

08:51.599 --> 08:53.634
then I bring the whole thing up
to temperature.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.268
*

08:55.302 --> 08:57.104
- Andrew's in the oil.

08:57.137 --> 08:58.238
- Thought he was going
around and around,

08:58.271 --> 09:00.040
but he'soing back and forth.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.775
- I don't see any warps
in my blade,

09:01.809 --> 09:03.844
and my blade looks
awesomely straight.

09:03.877 --> 09:09.082
*

09:09.116 --> 09:10.784
- I'm working
a lot with my hammer.

09:10.818 --> 09:12.185
I'm more comfortable
with my hammer.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.754
I do a lot of
hand-forging at home.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.355
*

09:15.388 --> 09:18.025
all: Whoa!

09:18.058 --> 09:19.993
- That was a close one.
- What do you think

09:20.027 --> 09:22.663
of the purist method,
with no power tools?

09:22.696 --> 09:26.867
- That's a fantastic way to do
things, if you have the time.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.769
Chad doesn't have the time.

09:28.802 --> 09:31.972
*

09:32.005 --> 09:33.941
I keep hammering it,
and I'm realizing

09:33.974 --> 09:36.910
it's getting longer
and longer and longer.

09:36.944 --> 09:39.713
I'm cutting a square off
right on the end.

09:39.747 --> 09:42.315
- Well, I think what he did
is he started to form his tang,

09:42.349 --> 09:44.117
and realized
that his scale was off

09:44.151 --> 09:47.320
between the tang and the blade.

09:47.354 --> 09:50.123
- Now I'm starting back over
with shaping that drop point

09:50.157 --> 09:51.759
and shaping the tip again.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.060
It's either gonna make it
or break it,

09:53.093 --> 09:54.662
one way or the other.

09:54.695 --> 09:58.198
*

09:58.231 --> 10:00.934
- I've been working
on separating the D-guard

10:00.968 --> 10:03.336
from the handle.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.205
Um...

10:05.238 --> 10:07.107
A few minutes into this,

10:07.140 --> 10:09.376
I realize that
I'm pretty much wasting my time.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.645
I don't need this
D-guard to be done yet.

10:11.679 --> 10:14.915
I can finish it in round two.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.217
I need to get
this knife hardened.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.819
It's kind of like
having children.

10:18.852 --> 10:21.154
You never feel like
you're ready,

10:21.188 --> 10:22.856
but if you wait until
you're ready, you never do it.

10:22.890 --> 10:28.128
*

10:28.161 --> 10:29.930
- Looks like Tom just
quenched his blade.

10:29.963 --> 10:33.801
- Hmm. It's not hard.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.903
I could dig a trench in it
with that file.

10:35.936 --> 10:38.371
I'm starting to feel like
I'm doing something wrong,

10:38.405 --> 10:40.340
and it kind of worries me
a little bit.

10:40.373 --> 10:43.143
So I have to go back
and do it again.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.078
This is it.
I have to do this one right.

10:45.112 --> 10:47.014
If I don't get it right,

10:47.047 --> 10:48.782
I'll start doing bad things
to the steel.

10:48.816 --> 10:50.283
This could be it.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.119
If this doesn't
harden the knife,

10:52.152 --> 10:54.121
then I guess
I'm just going home.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.724
*

10:56.757 --> 11:00.293
- Whoa!

11:00.327 --> 11:01.795
- That was, close, yeah.
- Yeah.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.831
*

11:03.864 --> 11:06.199
- All right, let's see.

11:06.233 --> 11:07.868
Well, it's better.

11:07.901 --> 11:10.871
I've quenched,
and my blade is hard.

11:10.904 --> 11:13.340
All I got to do is get it
into a shape that looks good,

11:13.373 --> 11:15.943
and I'm good to go.

11:15.976 --> 11:18.912
- You have just 30 minutes
remaining to finish your blades!

11:18.946 --> 11:20.380
*

11:20.413 --> 11:23.150
- I test my blade with a magnet.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.085
When it reaches critical
temperature,

11:25.118 --> 11:27.420
steel becomes non-magnetic.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.890
That's when it's ready
to heat treat

11:29.923 --> 11:31.424
immediately into the quench.

11:31.458 --> 11:34.895
*

11:34.928 --> 11:38.866
It looks a little bent,
so I go to my secret weapon,

11:38.899 --> 11:41.902
a straightening jig.

11:41.935 --> 11:44.504
It's nothing more than
a piece of angle iron

11:44.537 --> 11:47.374
and a flat piece of bar stock.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.977
I'm gonna clamp it in that,
straighten it out,

11:50.010 --> 11:52.245
let it sit there and cool down.

11:52.279 --> 11:54.514
Trying to hammer out
or put a knife

11:54.547 --> 11:56.449
in a vice to straighten it,

11:56.483 --> 11:57.918
you can break that blade.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.920
*

11:59.953 --> 12:01.288
- I have my guard stock,
and I'm breaking it

12:01.321 --> 12:03.390
down and start shaping it.

12:03.423 --> 12:07.795
- His guard material looks like
it's less than 3/4".

12:07.828 --> 12:09.763
Kind of forces you
to make a skinny guard,

12:09.797 --> 12:12.499
or at least a skinny neck
on the handle.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.301
- The clock's ticking,
and time's running out.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.936
Definitely feel that
I should be

12:15.969 --> 12:18.171
further along
on this guard than I am,

12:18.205 --> 12:19.973
and it's starting to get me
a little bit worried.

12:20.007 --> 12:22.109
*

12:22.142 --> 12:24.878
- Careful.

12:24.912 --> 12:27.080
With the power hammer,
I put a big curve into it.

12:27.114 --> 12:29.850
I don't want it to have a warp
when I quench it.

12:29.883 --> 12:31.551
Trying to cycle it in
and out a little bit,

12:31.584 --> 12:33.453
and then when I quench...

12:33.486 --> 12:34.888
Watch your back.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.924
*

12:36.957 --> 12:38.859
- Here we go, Chad,
he's in the oil.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.193
- Yeah, but the tip was grey.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.963
- Tip was grey.
Yeah, tip isn't hard.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.965
- Damn it.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.967
It's not hardened at all.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.836
*

12:48.869 --> 12:50.537
Now I've got to quench
a second time,

12:50.570 --> 12:53.373
and I'm not happy about it.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.142
All right.

12:55.175 --> 12:59.346
*

12:59.379 --> 13:02.049
The file's skating
across it a little,

13:02.082 --> 13:04.351
but not to my satisfaction.

13:04.384 --> 13:07.287
And as much as I hate to do
a third quench, I have to do it.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.189
Better to aim for the stars
and miss then to aim

13:09.222 --> 13:11.258
for [bleep] and hit.

13:11.291 --> 13:14.494
Last time.

13:14.527 --> 13:19.099
*

13:19.132 --> 13:21.168
Better.

13:21.201 --> 13:24.104
As the old saying goes,
the third time's a charm.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.573
Trying to get
my blade profile set now,

13:26.606 --> 13:28.876
and I realize right down
the center of my blade,

13:28.909 --> 13:30.510
I got a little overzealous
with the hammer,

13:30.543 --> 13:32.512
and there's some pretty
deep hammer marks.

13:32.545 --> 13:35.448
If I don't get those
hammer marks

13:35.482 --> 13:37.584
straightened out,
it could very well send me home.

13:37.617 --> 13:39.853
*

13:39.887 --> 13:42.455
- Ten minutes!

13:42.489 --> 13:45.125
- With ten minutes left,
I'm thinking,

13:45.158 --> 13:49.429
you know, maybe it's time for me
to step this up a notch.

13:49.462 --> 13:51.264
I'm gonna try to put
some bling on this blade.

13:51.298 --> 13:53.400
*

13:53.433 --> 13:55.068
- One thing about the D-guard,

13:55.102 --> 13:58.505
you don't want it
to protrude too far out.

13:58.538 --> 14:02.409
- I think that that is exactly
the guard you are talking about.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.978
Out of proportion
with the blade.

14:05.012 --> 14:07.915
- I've made a blade that I feel
is a pretty nice blade

14:07.948 --> 14:10.117
for what it is.
It's big, it's powerful.

14:10.150 --> 14:12.185
You could pry open doors

14:12.219 --> 14:15.655
and beat people down
with this knife.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.391
- Ten, nine, eight,

14:18.425 --> 14:20.527
seven, six,

14:20.560 --> 14:22.595
five, four,

14:22.629 --> 14:25.899
three, two, one!

14:25.933 --> 14:28.068
Bladesmiths, shut down
your machines!

14:28.101 --> 14:29.569
Drop your tools!

14:29.602 --> 14:33.406
Your forging time is over!

14:33.440 --> 14:36.609
- My handle kind of takes away
from the look.

14:36.643 --> 14:39.079
It's got this nice, shiny blade,

14:39.112 --> 14:41.148
and then you've got this handle
that's kind of blah.

14:41.181 --> 14:43.951
This is not done.

14:43.984 --> 14:48.188
I am worried that it's not
going to present well.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.557
- Bladesmiths, it's time
for the judges

14:50.590 --> 14:52.659
to take a closer look
at your work.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.327
Tom, you're up first.

14:54.361 --> 14:56.029
Please present your work
to the judges.

14:56.063 --> 14:58.131
*

14:58.165 --> 15:01.334
- Blade looks good. Just got
a slight wiggle on the edge,

15:01.368 --> 15:04.037
and your tang is a bit offset.

15:04.071 --> 15:07.240
- If we were to look at the
blade this way, job well done.

15:07.274 --> 15:09.476
When we start looking
at it this way,

15:09.509 --> 15:11.378
there's some issues over here.

15:11.411 --> 15:16.083
This part here, ricasso,
is quite big.

15:16.116 --> 15:17.350
- All right, Andrew, you're up.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.119
*

15:19.152 --> 15:20.620
- Andrew, I like
the look of this.

15:20.653 --> 15:22.522
You've got a nice, thick spine,

15:22.555 --> 15:25.025
and you've got that
convex edge down the middle.

15:25.058 --> 15:26.593
It's gonna really give you
a little extra foundation

15:26.626 --> 15:28.495
in the nail chop.

15:28.528 --> 15:31.431
- I like aggressive points
on Bowies.

15:31.464 --> 15:35.002
I usually put more of a belly
into them, but--not a word.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.669
- [laughing]

15:36.703 --> 15:39.039
- But that looks clean.
It's nice work.

15:39.072 --> 15:41.008
- Thank you.
- Chad, you're up.

15:41.041 --> 15:44.044
*

15:44.077 --> 15:45.712
- One of the things I do like
to see is I like smiths

15:45.745 --> 15:47.680
setting themselves up
for a second round.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.649
You took the time
to drill those holes,

15:49.682 --> 15:53.186
put a tab on the back that you
can attach that guard to.

15:53.220 --> 15:56.256
- My big problem
is all these hammer marks.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.025
You were going to town.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.460
You were like the morning
jackhammer outside.

16:00.493 --> 16:04.197
- All right. Tim, please present
your blade to the judges.

16:04.231 --> 16:07.500
*

16:07.534 --> 16:11.571
- Tim, I like your blade.
The only major thing is the tang

16:11.604 --> 16:14.507
shooting way up
out of alignment with the blade.

16:14.541 --> 16:17.044
A nice, convexed edge.

16:17.077 --> 16:19.112
Overall, nicely done.
- Thank you.

16:19.146 --> 16:20.447
- All right, bladesmiths.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.482
The judges have a decision
to me,

16:22.515 --> 16:24.784
so I'm gonna ask you to please
step off the forge floor.

16:24.817 --> 16:29.256
*

16:29.289 --> 16:31.424
- That was pretty intense, huh?
- Yeah.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.760
- All right, judges. Let's take
a closer look at these Bowies.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.462
We'll start with Tim's
on the end, please.

16:35.495 --> 16:39.766
- Oh, man.
They're looking at mine. Oh.

16:39.799 --> 16:41.468
- He's done a really nice job
forging this.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.670
His grinds are very clean.

16:43.703 --> 16:46.106
He's got a little cleanup
to do down here at the plunges.

16:46.139 --> 16:49.576
The visual concern
is that that tang rises up.

16:49.609 --> 16:51.111
It's a pretty easy fix.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.180
But, you know, his edge is nice.

16:53.213 --> 16:54.581
His grind lines are good.

16:54.614 --> 16:56.783
I think he's well on his way.

16:56.816 --> 17:00.720
- Let's move on to Chad's blade.

17:00.753 --> 17:02.455
- His forge work was great,

17:02.489 --> 17:04.557
but got these deep marks in here

17:04.591 --> 17:07.527
that he could not take out
on the wheel.

17:07.560 --> 17:10.430
If Chad had actually brought
his grinds up to the spine,

17:10.463 --> 17:13.400
he probably could've wiped out
at least 80% of this.

17:13.433 --> 17:15.402
- Look at those hammer marks.
Oh.

17:15.435 --> 17:18.338
- There's basic design elements
that he's added to this,

17:18.371 --> 17:20.340
but he hasn't quite nailed.

17:20.373 --> 17:23.243
If that clip point
was carried back to about here,

17:23.276 --> 17:25.445
it might just have better lines.

17:25.478 --> 17:27.347
I don't mind that kind of
roach belly to it,

17:27.380 --> 17:30.550
but if you're gonna do that,
define your ricasso.

17:30.583 --> 17:33.553
There's no definition here.
It just sort of peters out.

17:33.586 --> 17:36.456
- All right. Let's take a look
at Andrew's blade.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.491
*

17:38.525 --> 17:41.161
- I like the design
that Andrew presented us.

17:41.194 --> 17:43.096
What I like about this false
edge over here

17:43.130 --> 17:45.498
is that not only does it support
for the thrust,

17:45.532 --> 17:47.134
but it also allows him in combat

17:47.167 --> 17:48.801
to be able to slash
from the back,

17:48.835 --> 17:51.271
and then enter
with a slashing thrust.

17:51.304 --> 17:53.640
- And our last bladesmith, J.

17:53.673 --> 17:56.209
*

17:56.243 --> 18:00.147
- My big this is this gigantic
ricasso. I mean, yeah.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.781
Hey, let's choke up
on our Bowie knife.

18:01.814 --> 18:04.117
That's a lot of
choking up to do.

18:04.151 --> 18:08.888
- The scale is great
until you get to that ricasso.

18:08.921 --> 18:12.259
It's just a huge issue to me.

18:12.292 --> 18:13.193
- Doug, have you made
your final decision?

18:13.226 --> 18:14.294
- Yes, I have.

18:14.327 --> 18:15.428
- Dave?
- Yep.

18:15.462 --> 18:17.130
- J?
- Oh, yeah.

18:17.164 --> 18:20.467
- All right.
Let's go tell our smiths.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.670
Bladesmiths, the judges have
completed their deliberation.

18:23.703 --> 18:26.673
The bladesmith leaving
the forge is...

18:26.706 --> 18:28.275
*

18:28.308 --> 18:29.542
Chad.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.511
Your blade did not make the cut.

18:31.544 --> 18:32.779
- Chad, being our bladesmith
with the least amount

18:32.812 --> 18:34.447
of experience in this challenge,

18:34.481 --> 18:36.216
you did exactly
what we asked you to.

18:36.249 --> 18:38.151
You worked hard,
and you gave us a finished,

18:38.185 --> 18:40.220
heat-treated Bowie blade.

18:40.253 --> 18:42.389
But the issue being those
deep hammer marks,

18:42.422 --> 18:44.324
that grind that is so low,

18:44.357 --> 18:46.459
and the ricasso
not being developed.

18:46.493 --> 18:47.560
There's a lot of issues
going on.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.362
So, at the end of the day,

18:49.396 --> 18:51.564
you presented us
with the least-developed blade,

18:51.598 --> 18:53.166
and that's why
we're sending you home.

18:53.200 --> 18:57.170
- Chad, please
surrender your blade.

18:57.204 --> 18:58.505
- I don't know if I was exactly

18:58.538 --> 19:00.373
surprised
to be the one going home.

19:00.407 --> 19:02.242
I guess in the back of my mind,
I hoped I wasn't.

19:02.275 --> 19:04.211
But it's kind of one
of the mantras with the Marine

19:04.244 --> 19:06.246
Corps is improvise,
adapt, and overcome.

19:06.279 --> 19:10.750
So I'll just keep making blades,
and keep doing what I do.

19:10.783 --> 19:12.452
- Congratulations, bladesmiths.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.321
You've made it
to the second round.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.589
It's time to turn them
into fully-functional Bowies

19:16.623 --> 19:18.691
by attaching handles to them.

19:18.725 --> 19:21.194
However, there is a twist.

19:21.228 --> 19:24.264
You must incorporate at least
one natural element

19:24.297 --> 19:25.798
from the pantry

19:25.832 --> 19:29.269
into your blade's
finished construction.

19:29.302 --> 19:33.206
Good luck, bladesmiths.
Your three hours starts now.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.275
- Here we go.
- D-guards.

19:35.308 --> 19:36.543
This should be interesting.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.645
Now, only two of our smiths

19:38.678 --> 19:40.880
have actually started working
on the whole D-guard setup.

19:40.913 --> 19:44.251
One smith only has
a flat bar of metal.

19:44.284 --> 19:46.653
- My plan is finish
my guard first,

19:46.686 --> 19:48.888
then start working
on the handle,

19:48.921 --> 19:51.558
and then put one
and two together.

19:51.591 --> 19:54.461
I'm trying to just smooth
the top of it up a little bit,

19:54.494 --> 19:56.629
getting some of
the deep scratches out.

19:56.663 --> 19:58.831
- Tim's doing good.
He's got everything cleaned up.

19:58.865 --> 20:01.268
He has not addressed
that tang issue at all,

20:01.301 --> 20:02.702
so we're looking at a knife

20:02.735 --> 20:04.304
that if I go to stab you
in the heart,

20:04.337 --> 20:05.605
I'm gonna hit you
in the shoulder instead.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.674
*

20:07.707 --> 20:11.244
- I wonder if Tom is gonna plan
on just keeping that

20:11.278 --> 20:12.879
D-guard that he started.

20:12.912 --> 20:16.283
- Man, looks like it's a really
spindly D-guard.

20:16.316 --> 20:17.850
- I'm just hoping
he understands

20:17.884 --> 20:21.421
that a D-guard has to be closed.

20:21.454 --> 20:24.657
- I have a pretty significant
bend in my tang,

20:24.691 --> 20:28.528
so I need to heat that sucker up
and get that bend out of there.

20:28.561 --> 20:31.931
- He's significantly made
a turn in that tang.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.966
I was not expecting
something that aggressive.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.303
- I wasn't either.
- That flame is...

20:36.336 --> 20:39.038
- Oh, holy cow.
- Not properly adjusted.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.840
- Maybe this is Tom's plan.

20:40.873 --> 20:42.675
Blind us all so we can't see
what's going on.

20:42.709 --> 20:45.912
- Uh-oh, over to the water.

20:45.945 --> 20:49.349
- Okay, that's just not good.

20:49.382 --> 20:50.883
- I'll just hold it here
for a couple of minutes

20:50.917 --> 20:52.952
while the handle cools.

20:52.985 --> 20:54.521
- Basically,
he just crystallized

20:54.554 --> 20:57.524
the heck out of that blade.

20:57.557 --> 21:01.828
- Bladesmiths!
One hour has elapsed!

21:01.861 --> 21:04.597
I don't know
what Andrew's doing with that,

21:04.631 --> 21:06.966
but I want him to use
the entire thing, somehow.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.968
Ha!

21:09.001 --> 21:11.037
- I decided to go with
the elk horn

21:11.070 --> 21:12.972
because it already has a natural
handle shape to it,

21:13.005 --> 21:15.442
and it'll just look
really bad-ass.

21:15.475 --> 21:18.445
- See, what Andrew's doing here
is the technique I use a lot.

21:18.478 --> 21:19.846
You've got the drill bit.

21:19.879 --> 21:23.350
You literally use it
as a router.

21:23.383 --> 21:24.651
- I have the initial
holes drilled,

21:24.684 --> 21:26.786
and I start trying to use
the brooch

21:26.819 --> 21:30.857
that I brought to hollow out
the material for the tang slot.

21:30.890 --> 21:33.526
[bleep].
That fails miserably.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.662
- Andrew's really
getting frustrated.

21:35.695 --> 21:37.330
- I'm a little bit concerned
at this point

21:37.364 --> 21:38.931
that it's taking way too long

21:38.965 --> 21:40.800
to get that handle
material drilled out.

21:40.833 --> 21:42.969
I need to get this done.

21:43.002 --> 21:46.373
- For the handle, I picked a
pretty piece of desert ironwood.

21:46.406 --> 21:48.341
The biggest obstacle
is making sure

21:48.375 --> 21:50.477
everything lines up
on the D-guard.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.745
*

21:52.779 --> 21:54.847
Damn!

21:54.881 --> 21:57.417
I've got a gap
between the handle

21:57.450 --> 21:59.986
on both ends,
between the guards.

22:00.019 --> 22:03.055
Damn.
Crap on a cracker.

22:03.089 --> 22:05.558
This is very frustrating.

22:05.592 --> 22:07.894
The handle is already
epoxied on,

22:07.927 --> 22:11.464
so I can't pull it off.

22:11.498 --> 22:16.536
Here I go. I'm going home.

22:16.569 --> 22:19.639
- [bleep].
I'm seeing gaps

22:19.672 --> 22:21.073
between the handle
and the guard.

22:21.107 --> 22:23.476
I have to do something
at this point.

22:23.510 --> 22:26.012
I know I saw leather
over here somewhere.

22:26.045 --> 22:30.850
- So Tim is definitely not gonna
let us see what he's up to.

22:30.883 --> 22:35.588
- I take the leather
and wrap it around the gaps.

22:35.622 --> 22:38.625
I'm not quite as confident
at this point.

22:38.658 --> 22:44.030
If it comes down to fit
and finish, bye-bye.

22:44.063 --> 22:48.401
- Bladesmiths! Only 30 minutes
remains in this round!

22:48.435 --> 22:51.003
*

22:51.037 --> 22:54.106
- I find a pair of horn scales.

22:54.140 --> 22:55.908
They're very thin, though,

22:55.942 --> 22:57.577
so I find myself
some nice red liner

22:57.610 --> 22:59.178
that will also give just

22:59.211 --> 23:00.647
a little more thickness
to the handle,

23:00.680 --> 23:02.449
and make it more
pleasant to grip.

23:02.482 --> 23:09.088
*

23:09.121 --> 23:11.958
Everything's set up,
but they don't fit right.

23:11.991 --> 23:14.527
Oh.

23:14.561 --> 23:17.597
I've got all the scales
completely backwards,

23:17.630 --> 23:19.466
upside down and turned around,

23:19.499 --> 23:21.133
and I have to
pull that sucker apart

23:21.167 --> 23:24.871
and get it back together
before that epoxy sets.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.873
Hot diggity.

23:26.906 --> 23:29.041
*

23:29.075 --> 23:32.078
- I'm frustrated. I can't get
the tang and the guard

23:32.111 --> 23:34.514
and the handle material
to line up at the same time.

23:34.547 --> 23:36.916
[bleep].

23:36.949 --> 23:40.520
- That 5160 is not gonna be
as easy to bend or manipulate.

23:40.553 --> 23:42.722
*

23:42.755 --> 23:44.156
- [bleep].
It's just back

23:44.190 --> 23:46.192
and forth from the anvil
to the torch,

23:46.225 --> 23:47.894
tweaking it and trying
to get everything lined up,

23:47.927 --> 23:49.629
and it's just really
giving me some problems.

23:49.662 --> 23:53.500
*

23:53.533 --> 23:55.968
- Well, he just cut the end
of the tang off, I think.

23:56.002 --> 23:58.805
- Yeah. He's gonna paint it over
after he glues it, I guess.

23:58.838 --> 24:00.973
- It's not 100%,

24:01.007 --> 24:05.177
but the clock is ticking and
I have to find a happy medium.

24:05.211 --> 24:07.580
- Seven, six,

24:07.614 --> 24:09.849
five, four,

24:09.882 --> 24:12.785
three, two, one!

24:12.819 --> 24:15.121
Bladesmiths, drop your tools.

24:15.154 --> 24:16.956
This round is over.

24:16.989 --> 24:19.091
- I feel really good
about the whole thing.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.093
I had some frustrations
and struggles,

24:21.127 --> 24:22.995
but this was the best
that I could do in the time

24:23.029 --> 24:25.565
that I had, and it's
in the judges' hands now.

24:25.598 --> 24:28.668
- The guard, I'm not happy
with that at all.

24:28.701 --> 24:32.238
It's butt-ugly,
and I could've done better.

24:32.271 --> 24:34.607
- Gentlemen, welcome
to the strength test.

24:34.641 --> 24:37.009
Our dreaded nail chop.

24:37.043 --> 24:39.612
To test the strength
and durability of your blades,

24:39.646 --> 24:41.047
I'm gonna hammer your Bowies

24:41.080 --> 24:43.883
three times
into these 12-inch nails.

24:43.916 --> 24:46.753
Keep in mind, it's not
what we do to these nails.

24:46.786 --> 24:49.556
It's what these nails
are gonna do to your Bowies.

24:49.589 --> 24:52.058
You ready, Tom?
- We'll see.

24:52.091 --> 24:54.727
If I want to chop
a nail, I'll get a chisel.

24:54.761 --> 24:56.729
You don't use a knife for that.

24:56.763 --> 24:59.966
It only takes the tiniest amount
of anything to be wrong

24:59.999 --> 25:02.935
for it just
to turn catastrophic.

25:02.969 --> 25:05.938
[rock music]

25:05.972 --> 25:12.211
*

25:12.244 --> 25:14.814
Oh, jeez.

25:14.847 --> 25:17.717
- Well, Tom, you lost your top
guard there, most of it.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.686
- Yeah.

25:19.719 --> 25:21.921
- But your handle's still
on tight,

25:21.954 --> 25:25.658
your D didn't come apart,
and your blade held up.

25:25.692 --> 25:27.026
Nice job.

25:27.059 --> 25:29.829
- Whew.
- Andrew, you ready?

25:29.862 --> 25:30.963
- Not really.
- Okay.

25:30.997 --> 25:33.800
We're gonna do it anyway.

25:33.833 --> 25:37.169
- I'm feeling nauseous,
but as long

25:37.203 --> 25:38.838
as I can hold up
reasonably well,

25:38.871 --> 25:41.307
I think I'll do just fine.

25:41.340 --> 25:48.247
*

25:53.653 --> 25:55.622
- Well, Andrew,

25:55.655 --> 25:58.891
you got some chipping
and deformation.

25:58.925 --> 26:01.260
Right here,
chipped out a little bit.

26:01.293 --> 26:05.998
Down here, second and third
blows, these deformed out.

26:06.032 --> 26:08.134
But overall, it held up well.
Good job.

26:08.167 --> 26:10.603
- Thank you.
- Tim, what are you thinking?

26:10.637 --> 26:12.605
- Oh, I just peed a little.

26:12.639 --> 26:15.708
[laughter]

26:15.742 --> 26:17.744
Andrew's edge had edge damage.

26:17.777 --> 26:19.245
Tom lost part of the guard.

26:19.278 --> 26:22.214
So anything can go wrong
at this moment.

26:22.248 --> 26:27.353
*

26:27.386 --> 26:36.262
[rock music]

26:39.666 --> 26:42.869
- There is almost no damage
to this edge, Tim.

26:42.902 --> 26:44.904
The big thing is the alignment.

26:44.937 --> 26:50.076
The handle is also a bit off,
so when I'm holding it,

26:50.109 --> 26:51.944
it feels like
that blade's pointed at you,

26:51.978 --> 26:54.180
and it's actually pointing off
to the side.

26:54.213 --> 26:56.082
But apparently
that heat treat is nailed,

26:56.115 --> 26:58.084
and the edge
geometry is good, too.

26:58.117 --> 27:00.352
Nice job.

27:00.386 --> 27:03.756
- Bladesmiths,
this is the sharpness test.

27:03.790 --> 27:05.424
To see how sharp the edge
of your blades are,

27:05.457 --> 27:07.259
I will take your Bowie

27:07.293 --> 27:09.428
and lacerate
across these sides of beef.

27:09.461 --> 27:11.330
Tom, you're up first. You ready?

27:11.363 --> 27:13.866
- I'm ready.
- Let's do this.

27:13.900 --> 27:20.239
*

27:20.272 --> 27:22.675
Well, Tom,
the feel of your handle,

27:22.709 --> 27:23.743
you have these grooves
over here,

27:23.776 --> 27:25.344
so it's easy to index.

27:25.377 --> 27:27.246
The blade did most of the work,

27:27.279 --> 27:30.950
and you can see you have
very deep lacerations in there.

27:30.983 --> 27:33.285
Overall, your blade will cut.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.154
- Thank you, sir.
- Andrew, you're next.

27:35.187 --> 27:36.723
You ready?

27:36.756 --> 27:38.891
- Let's do it.
- Let's do this.

27:38.925 --> 27:45.865
*

27:48.801 --> 27:52.138
All right, Andrew. It feels good
when you put your hand in.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.106
It's got a good weight to it.

27:54.140 --> 27:55.742
It is sharp.

27:55.775 --> 27:57.409
It lacerates easily,

27:57.443 --> 28:01.147
letting the weight
of the blade do all the work.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.181
Your blade will cut.

28:02.214 --> 28:03.983
- Thank you.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.251
- All right, Tim,
it's your turn.

28:05.284 --> 28:07.153
- All righty.
- Let's do this.

28:07.186 --> 28:14.126
*

28:18.464 --> 28:21.801
Well, Tim, your handle's
a bit on the wider side,

28:21.834 --> 28:23.770
but when you swing it,

28:23.803 --> 28:26.138
the weight
of your Bowie lacerates

28:26.172 --> 28:27.974
through the beef easily.

28:28.007 --> 28:30.242
Your Bowie will cut.

28:30.276 --> 28:33.079
- Thank you.

28:33.112 --> 28:36.248
- Bladesmiths, the judges have
completed their deliberation,

28:36.282 --> 28:38.417
and they've made
their final decision.

28:38.450 --> 28:40.753
The bladesmith leaving
the forge is...

28:40.787 --> 28:44.891
*

28:44.924 --> 28:46.258
Tom.

28:46.292 --> 28:48.460
Your blade did not make the cut.

28:48.494 --> 28:50.229
- Tom, I really love the way
you addressed the issues

28:50.262 --> 28:52.431
that we talked about.

28:52.464 --> 28:54.366
You fixed your ricasso
creatively. That was great.

28:54.400 --> 28:57.870
But that heating and quenching
in water made your handle

28:57.904 --> 28:59.772
and guard area very brittle,

28:59.806 --> 29:01.507
and you lost that top guard.

29:01.540 --> 29:03.943
So, you suffered
a significant blade failure.

29:03.976 --> 29:05.511
That's why we're letting
you go today.

29:05.544 --> 29:07.213
- Yes, sir.

29:07.246 --> 29:09.882
- Tom, please surrender
your weapon.

29:09.916 --> 29:11.784
- I'm a sword maker, and I
came here and I made a knife.

29:11.818 --> 29:13.886
And I think I made a good knife.

29:13.920 --> 29:17.489
Tom will get time in the sun
when Tom earns time in the sun.

29:17.523 --> 29:19.291
It's okay.

29:19.325 --> 29:21.160
I'll take my glory
when I earn it.

29:21.193 --> 29:22.895
*

29:22.929 --> 29:24.964
- Andrew, Tim, congratulations.

29:24.997 --> 29:27.133
You've made it into the final
round of this competition.

29:27.166 --> 29:29.335
So now we're sending you back
to your home forges

29:29.368 --> 29:32.004
to re-create an iconic weapon
from history.

29:32.038 --> 29:35.541
*

29:35.574 --> 29:39.045
The shamshir.

29:39.078 --> 29:42.514
Descending from the saber family
of swords, the shamshir,

29:42.548 --> 29:45.051
which means
"curved like the tiger's tail,"

29:45.084 --> 29:48.020
first gained popularity
in Persia and quickly spread

29:48.054 --> 29:50.122
throughout the former
Ottoman Empire.

29:50.156 --> 29:52.291
Light in weight
and easy to wield,

29:52.324 --> 29:54.560
this deeply curved sword
featured a thin blade

29:54.593 --> 29:57.029
and a tapered
tip that was most effective

29:57.063 --> 29:59.465
when delivering sweeping
or hooking strokes,

29:59.498 --> 30:02.935
and was sharp enough
to slice adversaries in two.

30:02.969 --> 30:05.838
Although use of the sword
declined in the 20th century,

30:05.872 --> 30:07.439
it was rebirthed
as one of the main

30:07.473 --> 30:09.441
weapons of the protagonist
in the film

30:09.475 --> 30:11.477
"Prince of Persia:
The Sands of Time."

30:11.510 --> 30:13.212
You will have five days
at your home forge

30:13.245 --> 30:15.181
to complete this challenge.

30:15.214 --> 30:17.850
After five days, you will return
and present your weapons

30:17.884 --> 30:19.285
to our panel of expert judges.

30:19.318 --> 30:21.387
Only after
they've tested them

30:21.420 --> 30:23.990
will they declare one of you
the "Forged in Fire" champion

30:24.023 --> 30:27.026
who also leaves here
with that check for ten grand.

30:27.059 --> 30:28.627
Good luck, bladesmiths.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.462
- Good luck, Tim.

30:30.496 --> 30:33.632
*

30:33.665 --> 30:36.035
- I'm very excited to be back
to my home forge.

30:36.068 --> 30:39.972
I'm going to do a low layer,
random pattern Damascus blade.

30:40.006 --> 30:44.076
I feel that the judges will
appreciate the extra effort.

30:44.110 --> 30:45.912
Ideally, I would like
to have my billet

30:45.945 --> 30:47.980
welded up
as quickly as possible,

30:48.014 --> 30:51.317
but the Damascus is taking a
little bit longer than I expect.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.485
So I might be
a little bit behind,

30:53.519 --> 30:57.289
but I think it'll set
my blade apart from Tim's.

30:57.323 --> 31:00.159
*

31:00.192 --> 31:03.495
- We're here in my home shop
in Angier, North Carolina.

31:03.529 --> 31:06.565
This is the first blade
of this length

31:06.598 --> 31:08.067
that I've ever done

31:08.100 --> 31:11.503
with such a major curve in it,

31:11.537 --> 31:16.308
and it's a hot day.
[laughing]

31:16.342 --> 31:18.510
I've forged probably 98%

31:18.544 --> 31:21.948
of what I do
on the power hammer.

31:21.981 --> 31:23.249
But I keep hearing this hiss.

31:23.282 --> 31:26.585
"Sss."
I said, hmm.

31:26.618 --> 31:29.288
Something is not right.

31:29.321 --> 31:30.689
Any time you see smoke
on a compressor,

31:30.722 --> 31:34.460
that's not good.
We're in trouble.

31:34.493 --> 31:38.364
Without the air compressor,
I can't use my power hammer.

31:38.397 --> 31:43.002
It's all gonna be by hand,
so this is gonna be fun.

31:43.035 --> 31:45.571
[laughing]

31:45.604 --> 31:49.475
- Yesterday, I spent most of
my time shaping the blade.

31:49.508 --> 31:51.944
Today, I need to pick up
the pace.

31:51.978 --> 31:54.113
It's ready for heat treat.

31:54.146 --> 31:57.950
*

31:57.984 --> 32:00.019
That's what you're looking for.

32:00.052 --> 32:01.620
In order for me to be happy
at the end of the day,

32:01.653 --> 32:03.422
I'm gonna have to have
my guard forged,

32:03.455 --> 32:05.657
shaped, polished,
and fit to my tang.

32:05.691 --> 32:09.561
Oh, [bleep].

32:09.595 --> 32:12.698
Definitely have a lot
of struggles with this guard.

32:12.731 --> 32:14.300
It was looking really good,

32:14.333 --> 32:17.336
but I got off-center
with my cut,

32:17.369 --> 32:19.738
and I broke the langet off.

32:19.771 --> 32:22.274
I just wanted to throw [bleep].

32:22.308 --> 32:24.443
I spent most of the day
working on this guard,

32:24.476 --> 32:26.712
so it's disheartening.

32:26.745 --> 32:30.016
I need to just step back
and rethink my plan.

32:30.049 --> 32:31.550
*

32:31.583 --> 32:35.721
- Three days in,
I'm a little sore.

32:35.754 --> 32:40.092
Bent over the anvil
for five hours straight.

32:40.126 --> 32:42.661
I'm old.
[laughing]

32:42.694 --> 32:44.730
Never done anything this long,

32:44.763 --> 32:48.634
so this is maiden voyage
for my quench tank.

32:48.667 --> 32:51.337
Ah, we're leaking.

32:51.370 --> 32:54.606
And all my oil is just like
a little geyser,

32:54.640 --> 32:58.077
coming out of there.

32:58.110 --> 33:01.080
Lucky for me, I do have
a horizontal quench tank.

33:01.113 --> 33:08.054
*

33:09.488 --> 33:12.258
I see a bow here
and a bow there.

33:12.291 --> 33:15.461
One going this way and one
going back the other way.

33:15.494 --> 33:19.698
I've got to move quick, so I
slap it in my straightening jig.

33:19.731 --> 33:22.134
Bottom line, this is a mess.

33:22.168 --> 33:25.471
Can't go back now.

33:25.504 --> 33:27.673
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

33:27.706 --> 33:33.112
I'm almost afraid to look.

33:33.145 --> 33:35.447
*

33:35.481 --> 33:37.649
We are straight.

33:37.683 --> 33:39.451
I took a file.

33:39.485 --> 33:41.553
*

33:41.587 --> 33:45.257
[laughing]

33:45.291 --> 33:49.161
Oh, I'm just tickled to death.

33:49.195 --> 33:51.197
- I've still got
a lot of work ahead of me.

33:51.230 --> 33:53.732
I'm not 100% happy with what
I've got with my guard,

33:53.765 --> 33:56.535
but if I do a nice job
on the blade and the handle,

33:56.568 --> 33:58.437
I think it'll bring it
all together.

33:58.470 --> 34:01.707
But I got a slight warp
in the blade.

34:01.740 --> 34:04.143
You put this on here,
you can see where the warp is.

34:04.176 --> 34:05.677
If you use this file
as a straight edge,

34:05.711 --> 34:07.279
you have that gap right there.

34:07.313 --> 34:09.115
I've got to get this warp out,

34:09.148 --> 34:11.283
so what I'm doing is using
a couple clamps

34:11.317 --> 34:13.419
and a little jig
I have made in the temper

34:13.452 --> 34:15.621
to try to take it out.

34:15.654 --> 34:18.424
This is normally how I get
the warp out of my blades,

34:18.457 --> 34:20.559
but I'm having
more trouble this time.

34:20.592 --> 34:23.829
So I'm just gonna put a little
bit more tension on the blade,

34:23.862 --> 34:26.198
and maybe that'll work.

34:26.232 --> 34:27.733
I go back to the heat
treat oven,

34:27.766 --> 34:30.369
and I didn't get
the warp out entirely.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.104
And I'm starting to freak out
a little bit.

34:32.138 --> 34:33.572
I don't know
how I'm gonna fix it.

34:33.605 --> 34:37.376
*

34:37.409 --> 34:41.247
- Final day. I am exhausted.
[laughing]

34:41.280 --> 34:44.183
Right now,
I'm gonna do some chopping.

34:44.216 --> 34:50.656
*

34:50.689 --> 34:54.226
It does fantastic.

34:54.260 --> 34:56.895
I know I've got a sword
that will perform.

34:56.928 --> 34:59.798
Now it's just
getting the look down.

34:59.831 --> 35:02.868
This is all about
how it feels in the hand.

35:02.901 --> 35:05.537
One thing I always do
when I make a handle.

35:05.571 --> 35:07.439
I grind a bit.
I put it in my hand.

35:07.473 --> 35:09.875
I close my eyes.
I don't even look at it.

35:09.908 --> 35:14.713
Light grip. Squeeze it hard.

35:14.746 --> 35:16.915
Overall, I feel fantastic.

35:16.948 --> 35:19.918
I'm very confident
that it's a $10,000 blade.

35:19.951 --> 35:23.189
*

35:23.222 --> 35:26.358
- Bladesmiths, welcome back
to the Forge.

35:26.392 --> 35:28.627
You've had five days
to work on your weapons.

35:28.660 --> 35:30.462
Andrew, how'd it go?

35:30.496 --> 35:32.598
- Went really well.
I forged my shamshir

35:32.631 --> 35:34.533
from a low layer billet
of Damascus.

35:34.566 --> 35:37.203
It has 20 pieces in total
in the construction,

35:37.236 --> 35:39.571
and my guard and my handle
from wrought iron.

35:39.605 --> 35:41.373
- Tim, how'd it go for you?

35:41.407 --> 35:43.642
- Everything went well.

35:43.675 --> 35:46.778
Murphy's law definitely popped
his head in a couple times,

35:46.812 --> 35:50.682
but everything got forged out.
I'm happy.

35:50.716 --> 35:52.384
- Well, bladesmiths,
your weapons will now

35:52.418 --> 35:54.920
be put through
a series of brutal tests.

35:54.953 --> 35:56.655
Up first, the sharpness test.

35:56.688 --> 35:58.890
Dave?

35:58.924 --> 36:00.692
- To test the sharpness of
your weapon,

36:00.726 --> 36:03.395
I'll be cutting through
these three fish.

36:03.429 --> 36:05.231
Andrew, you're up first.
You ready for this?

36:05.264 --> 36:06.832
- Here goes nothing.

36:06.865 --> 36:08.600
Little nervous
about going first,

36:08.634 --> 36:10.502
but at the same time,
I'm pretty confident,

36:10.536 --> 36:13.505
because this blade's
like a razor.

36:13.539 --> 36:15.574
*

36:15.607 --> 36:17.409
Yes!

36:17.443 --> 36:21.613
*

36:21.647 --> 36:24.850
Nice.
- [laughing]

36:24.883 --> 36:26.952
All right, so first thing,
it's not a light sword.

36:26.985 --> 36:29.721
But the weight's
where I want it to be.

36:29.755 --> 36:31.590
Beautiful-looking handle.

36:31.623 --> 36:33.625
Having said that,
up here at the front,

36:33.659 --> 36:35.461
it's a little blocky.

36:35.494 --> 36:37.929
But, it's definitely sharp.

36:37.963 --> 36:39.598
Well done.
- Thank you.

36:39.631 --> 36:41.433
- All right, Tim.
You ready for this?

36:41.467 --> 36:43.769
- I'm ready.
- Good. Me too.

36:43.802 --> 36:46.838
- Andrew's blade performed well,
but I'm very confident.

36:46.872 --> 36:49.308
I'm not too afraid of fish.

36:49.341 --> 36:56.282
*

37:00.919 --> 37:04.923
- This blade is wonderfully
fast and light.

37:04.956 --> 37:08.026
Your handle, I like
the construction of it.

37:08.059 --> 37:10.896
But what I have a problem
with is this transition.

37:10.929 --> 37:13.732
The two materials,
it creates a bit of a lip.

37:13.765 --> 37:15.667
If that wrap went
all the way down,

37:15.701 --> 37:18.737
I think it would
feel pretty good.

37:18.770 --> 37:21.039
Having said that,
this is a beautiful piece,

37:21.072 --> 37:22.841
and it is definitely a cutter.

37:22.874 --> 37:25.477
- Thank you.
- Next up is the kill test.

37:25.511 --> 37:26.978
And for that,
I'll give you Doug.

37:27.012 --> 37:29.315
*

37:29.348 --> 37:31.950
- To see what kind of lethal
damage your weapon will do,

37:31.983 --> 37:33.919
I will take your shamshir
and deliver slashes

37:33.952 --> 37:36.555
and a thrust
on these pig carcasses.

37:36.588 --> 37:37.623
Andrew, you're up first.
You ready?

37:37.656 --> 37:39.858
- Let's do it.

37:39.891 --> 37:46.832
*

37:49.835 --> 37:51.470
- Andrew.

37:51.503 --> 37:53.839
Your shamshir
just became a Shamwow.

37:53.872 --> 37:56.475
[laughter]

37:56.508 --> 37:57.943
Your blade,
on the initial thrust,

37:57.976 --> 37:59.645
penetrated easily,

37:59.678 --> 38:02.514
and it lacerated
cleanly into the carcass.

38:02.548 --> 38:05.817
Your weapon, sir, will kill.
Good job.

38:05.851 --> 38:07.586
- Thank you.
- Tim, it's your turn.

38:07.619 --> 38:08.954
Shall we have fun?

38:08.987 --> 38:11.523
- Let's do it.
- Let's do this.

38:11.557 --> 38:18.497
*

38:21.700 --> 38:24.069
All right, Tim,
this is what a shamshir,

38:24.102 --> 38:25.937
I believe, should feel like.

38:25.971 --> 38:29.541
It definitely can thrust
into the carcass.

38:29.575 --> 38:30.942
It hit bone.
I felt it.

38:30.976 --> 38:33.078
I could feel it crunch.

38:33.111 --> 38:37.349
The edge here is sharp enough
to lacerate through the carcass,

38:37.383 --> 38:39.551
cutting all the way through.

38:39.585 --> 38:42.721
Overall, your weapon will kill.

38:42.754 --> 38:44.990
- Thank you.
- Next up is the strength test.

38:45.023 --> 38:47.759
Dave?

38:47.793 --> 38:50.429
- Now, the shamshir was a weapon
that was used both on foot

38:50.462 --> 38:52.498
and on horseback.

38:52.531 --> 38:54.833
So to test the strength
and durability of your blades,

38:54.866 --> 38:58.970
I'm going to chop into these
horse skulls three times.

38:59.004 --> 39:01.673
Andrew, are you ready for this?

39:01.707 --> 39:04.743
- I guess.
- Okay.

39:04.776 --> 39:07.379
- I'm definitely worried
about this sword breaking.

39:07.413 --> 39:11.116
My method of tempering is not
the way I typically do it.

39:11.149 --> 39:12.818
I just look down
and start saying my prayers.

39:15.587 --> 39:22.528
*

39:23.829 --> 39:25.997
[pieces clattering]

39:26.031 --> 39:27.433
[exhales]

39:27.466 --> 39:30.636
*

39:30.669 --> 39:32.103
- So, right off,

39:32.137 --> 39:34.740
I can feel a slight
rolled section

39:34.773 --> 39:37.108
where the edge
has just deformed a bit.

39:37.142 --> 39:41.012
But other than that,
it held up beautiful.

39:41.046 --> 39:44.583
Well done.
- Thank you.

39:44.616 --> 39:46.885
- [laughing]
Good smile, Tim.

39:46.918 --> 39:48.454
It's your turn.

39:48.487 --> 39:50.622
- Let's go.

39:50.656 --> 39:57.596
*

40:03.969 --> 40:05.937
- Okay, I can see where

40:05.971 --> 40:09.140
your edge has taken
some deformation here.

40:09.174 --> 40:11.777
It's light and it's fast,

40:11.810 --> 40:15.981
but it looks to me as though
your blade's picked up

40:16.014 --> 40:20.452
a slight roll that way
that I did not see before.

40:20.486 --> 40:24.723
Your blade goes off
at a bit of an angle.

40:24.756 --> 40:27.993
- Bladesmiths, a final decision
has been made.

40:28.026 --> 40:32.097
Only one of you can be
the "Forged in Fire" champion.

40:32.130 --> 40:34.833
And that champion is...

40:34.866 --> 40:37.035
Andrew.
Congratulations.

40:37.068 --> 40:38.704
You are the
"Forged in Fire" champion...

40:38.737 --> 40:40.639
- Yes.

40:40.672 --> 40:42.007
- And will be receiving
a check for $10,000.

40:42.040 --> 40:44.209
- Yes.
- Tim.

40:44.242 --> 40:46.978
Unfortunately, your blade
did not make the cut.

40:47.012 --> 40:49.948
- Tim, this is the kind of third
round weapon we love to see.

40:49.981 --> 40:52.684
Something we can really
put to the test.

40:52.718 --> 40:55.086
Now, both your weapons
had handle issues.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.856
Both your weapons
rolled an edge.

40:57.889 --> 41:00.692
Yours picked up a bend
in that final strength test,

41:00.726 --> 41:02.193
and that's why we're
letting you go home.

41:02.227 --> 41:04.663
But that was a pleasure to use,

41:04.696 --> 41:05.864
and it's a weapon
you should be proud of.

41:05.897 --> 41:07.566
- Thank you. I am.

41:07.599 --> 41:10.736
- Tim, please surrender
your weapon.

41:10.769 --> 41:11.937
- Obviously,
I'm a little disappointed.

41:11.970 --> 41:14.005
I wanted to win,

41:14.039 --> 41:16.575
but I'm very proud
of the shamshir that I made.

41:16.608 --> 41:18.944
I enjoyed
the competition immensely.

41:18.977 --> 41:23.615
It's been one of the highlights
of my life.

41:23.649 --> 41:25.083
- Andrew, congratulations.

41:25.116 --> 41:27.085
You are the "Forged in Fire"
champion,

41:27.118 --> 41:30.021
and that's a title that comes
with a check for $10,000.

41:30.055 --> 41:32.257
- Yes!
[applause]

41:32.290 --> 41:34.059
I definitely feel relieved.
It feels great.

41:34.092 --> 41:35.861
I mean, I came here to win

41:35.894 --> 41:37.262
and prove to myself
that I was able to do it,

41:37.295 --> 41:38.997
and I can hang
with these other guys,

41:39.030 --> 41:40.198
with their credentials
or whatnot.

41:40.231 --> 41:41.867
I don't have any of that.

41:41.900 --> 41:43.802
I'm just a guy from the woods,
you know?

41:43.835 --> 41:49.107
