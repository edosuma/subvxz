Talk ya ish, young queen.
How you been?

26:44.479 --> 26:45.939
- Aside from global warming
and the polarized

26:45.980 --> 26:48.274
political climate
in this country, fantastic.

26:48.316 --> 26:50.777
- Ash, why don't you
hook up Will with some food?

26:50.819 --> 26:52.862
- Come on, Will.
- Let's do it.

26:52.904 --> 26:58.660
* *

27:00.995 --> 27:02.122
A'ight,
I'm gonna keep it tall.

27:02.163 --> 27:03.790
I'm not feeling
none of this fancy stuff.

27:03.832 --> 27:06.501
- You can order off-menu.
Anything you want.

27:06.543 --> 27:09.462
I'm gonna go find Hilary.
Glad you're here, Will.

27:09.504 --> 27:14.259
* *

27:14.300 --> 27:16.469
- Anything I want.

27:16.511 --> 27:18.638
A'ight. Hey, papi!

27:18.680 --> 27:19.639
You think you can make me
a cheesesteak,

27:19.681 --> 27:20.724
West Philly style?

27:20.765 --> 27:22.267
- I think
I can make that happen.

27:22.308 --> 27:23.893
- Okay, cool, let me get that
with salt, pepper, ketchup,

27:23.935 --> 27:25.645
fried onions...

27:25.687 --> 27:27.313
- Before you walk
into my court...

27:27.355 --> 27:29.274
- Hey, man, don't be afraid
to brown them onions.

27:29.315 --> 27:30.692
There you go.
Yo, matter of fact, man,

27:30.734 --> 27:33.194
burn them jawns, man.
- You do know that "papi" runs

27:33.236 --> 27:35.655
one of the best restaurants
in LA, right?

27:35.697 --> 27:36.656
- That don't mean
he know how to make

27:36.698 --> 27:39.034
a West Philly cheesesteak,
feel me?

27:39.075 --> 27:41.119
And I'm Will, by the way.

27:41.161 --> 27:42.954
- Lisa.

27:42.996 --> 27:45.999
Not gonna lie, I'm loving
the kicks with the suit.

27:46.041 --> 27:47.459
Cuts quite a figure
from a distance.

27:47.500 --> 27:48.835
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm.

27:48.877 --> 27:50.462
- How about up close?

27:50.503 --> 27:53.381
- Hmm, it's pretty nice
up close too.

27:53.423 --> 27:54.424
- Yeah?
- [laughs]

27:54.466 --> 27:56.343
- You know, you look
pretty good too,

27:56.384 --> 27:57.844
Mona Lisa.

27:57.886 --> 28:00.472
- [laughs]
- Ah, you get that a lot? Yeah?

28:00.513 --> 28:01.431
- Order up, Philly.

28:02.766 --> 28:05.560
- Oh, pardon me.
Yo, good looking out, yo.

28:05.602 --> 28:07.312
'Bout to tear this jawn up.

28:07.354 --> 28:09.230
- Oh.
[laughs]

28:09.272 --> 28:10.648
- Mmm.

28:10.690 --> 28:12.525
Ooh, ooh.

28:12.567 --> 28:14.569
Hey, yo, this jawn crazy.

28:14.611 --> 28:16.363
Hey, pap, you making Philly
real proud out here.

28:16.404 --> 28:17.614
You got family out here
or something?

28:17.655 --> 28:20.075
- Nah, Pittsburgh.
- Philadelphia...

28:20.116 --> 28:22.702
the city of brotherly love
and clogged arteries.

28:22.744 --> 28:24.204
You're a long way
from home, Will.

28:24.245 --> 28:26.039
Glad you made it in one piece.
- What up, Carlton?

28:26.081 --> 28:29.042
How you been, bro?
- Uh, good.

28:30.293 --> 28:32.962
Hey, Lis.
I see you met my cousin.

28:34.756 --> 28:35.924
- Yeah.

28:38.927 --> 28:41.137
Well, I'll let you two
catch up.

28:41.179 --> 28:43.473
Nice to meet you, Will, and...

28:43.515 --> 28:45.767
I hope all is well, Carlton.

28:45.809 --> 28:47.268
Later.

28:51.272 --> 28:54.192
- Hey, yo,
she was cool as fuck.

28:54.234 --> 28:55.402
Baddie too.

28:55.443 --> 28:56.569
Yo, anyways, man,
how you been, bro?

28:56.611 --> 28:57.570
It's been a minute.

28:57.612 --> 28:59.781
- You know, thriving.

29:02.534 --> 29:04.077
- You gonna ask me
how I've been or...

29:04.119 --> 29:05.912
- Oh, you gonna tell me
why you're wearing my clothes?

29:05.954 --> 29:08.331
- Oh, shit.
Yeah, Hilary set me up.

29:08.373 --> 29:10.667
Something about
a failed growth spurt.

29:10.709 --> 29:12.002
[laughter]

29:12.043 --> 29:13.753
- Yeah, no, it's cool.

29:13.795 --> 29:17.424
Look, it's just, Dad believes
that the details make the man.

29:17.465 --> 29:20.844
So if you're gonna wear
my $500 cufflinks,

29:20.885 --> 29:23.221
let's at least make sure

29:23.263 --> 29:25.140
that you wear them up right.

29:26.975 --> 29:28.893
- Appreciate the help, cuz.
- Hey, no problem.

29:28.935 --> 29:30.353
I'm sure I'll be
helping you out a lot.

29:32.105 --> 29:34.315
- What do you mean by that?
- Oh, you know,

29:34.357 --> 29:36.401
helping you fit in at school,
showing you around.

29:37.485 --> 29:39.446
Mom and Dad said
that you're out here

29:39.487 --> 29:41.072
for a better education.

29:42.866 --> 29:44.159
- Uh...

29:44.200 --> 29:45.326
yeah, I mean, we still
trying to figure out

29:45.368 --> 29:46.786
this little arrangement
type jawn so...

29:46.828 --> 29:48.997
- Yeah, yeah.

29:49.039 --> 29:50.248
Well, I hope one day,

29:50.290 --> 29:53.001
we can talk about
why you're really here.

29:54.252 --> 29:57.005
I gotta go.
Welcome to Bel-Air, Will.

29:58.423 --> 29:59.382
- Okay.

30:02.969 --> 30:04.804
- What's up?
- Hey.

30:04.846 --> 30:05.972
So they're ready
for the big speech?

30:06.014 --> 30:07.140
- A couple minutes.

30:07.182 --> 30:08.600
Meaning there's plenty of time
for me

30:08.641 --> 30:11.811
to take back my title
from the champ over here.

30:11.853 --> 30:12.812
- This ain't lacrosse, bro.

30:12.854 --> 30:14.147
And I don't do rematches.

30:14.189 --> 30:16.232
- Plus, you don't wanna
mess up your hair.

30:16.274 --> 30:18.735
Wouldn't wanna ruin a perfect
Banks family moment, would we?

30:18.777 --> 30:21.112
- Hey, what could go wrong
with a photo op with us in it?

30:21.154 --> 30:22.280
I mean, look at us:

30:22.322 --> 30:25.241
pure, unadulterated
Black excellence.

30:25.283 --> 30:27.410
- Period.
- So real question.

30:27.452 --> 30:29.245
Is Will gonna be up there
with us?

30:29.287 --> 30:31.539
- Mm, let's just ease him
into it.

30:31.581 --> 30:33.333
Seems like a lot for one day,
hmm?

30:33.375 --> 30:35.293
- No, I say we bring
his ass onstage

30:35.335 --> 30:37.170
and make him suffer
like the rest of us.

30:37.212 --> 30:39.047
Give him the full
Banks family experience.

30:39.089 --> 30:40.840
- Exactly, that means
campaign events,

30:40.882 --> 30:42.300
talking points, and photo ops.

30:42.342 --> 30:44.511
- A big house, nice cars,
a great education--

30:44.552 --> 30:46.262
I mean, who wouldn't take
that deal?

30:46.304 --> 30:48.014
- So what are you saying,
Carlton?

30:48.056 --> 30:50.517
Are you cool with Will
being here?

30:50.558 --> 30:52.394
- Seems like a cool dude.

30:52.435 --> 30:53.895
Plus, I've always wanted
a brother,

30:53.937 --> 30:55.563
but I got y'all, so...

30:56.940 --> 30:58.817
- Okay, they're ready for us.

30:58.858 --> 31:00.068
Let's go be perfect.

31:00.110 --> 31:01.528
- Ladies and gentlemen,
my family and I

31:01.569 --> 31:04.239
would like to welcome you all
to our home

31:04.280 --> 31:07.033
and to express our sincere
appreciation to you

31:07.075 --> 31:10.036
for your support
of my campaign

31:10.078 --> 31:11.788
for Los Angeles
district attorney.

31:11.830 --> 31:15.375
[applause]

31:16.209 --> 31:19.546
I was compelled to launch
this campaign because,

31:19.587 --> 31:21.506
well...

31:21.548 --> 31:23.341
I'm tired, folks.

31:24.426 --> 31:26.219
I'm tired...

31:26.261 --> 31:28.638
of watching this broken system

31:28.680 --> 31:30.056
discard young Black men

31:30.098 --> 31:34.144
into the for-profit
school-to-prison pipeline.

31:34.185 --> 31:37.814
And if I'm elected DA,
I will stop at nothing

31:37.856 --> 31:39.315
to ensure that justice prevails

31:39.357 --> 31:41.651
for everyone
in our beautiful city.

31:41.693 --> 31:46.197
Because together,
we will change the status quo.

31:46.239 --> 31:48.783
Hell of a day, huh, Will?

31:48.825 --> 31:50.368
- Yeah, something like that.

31:52.704 --> 31:55.040
- No need to sit, Will.
I know you must be tired.

31:55.081 --> 31:56.916
Trust me, this won't take long.

31:56.958 --> 31:59.753
[dramatic music]

31:59.794 --> 32:02.380
You know, I meant it when
I said I'm glad you're here,

32:02.422 --> 32:05.300
but as long as you're under
my roof, you follow my rules.

32:06.176 --> 32:08.261
I trust you're smart enough
to know what they are.

32:08.303 --> 32:10.680
- Yeah. I got a mom
and a crib back home.

32:10.722 --> 32:11.848
I also got a brain that works.

32:11.890 --> 32:13.725
- Yet a gun found its way
into your hand.

32:14.976 --> 32:16.186
Brain take a day off?

32:16.227 --> 32:17.687
- Man, you don't even know
what happened.

32:17.729 --> 32:19.022
- I know you got arrested.

32:19.064 --> 32:20.440
I also know that
your fingerprints were found

32:20.482 --> 32:22.567
on an unregistered
9-millimeter Glock

32:22.609 --> 32:24.110
and that you'd still be sitting
in a jail cell

32:24.152 --> 32:25.612
if it wasn't for me.

32:25.653 --> 32:27.489
Jail or worse.

32:29.991 --> 32:31.868
Look...

32:31.910 --> 32:34.204
all I want is for us
to have an understanding, son.

32:34.245 --> 32:35.997
- Yo, I ain't your son,

32:36.039 --> 32:37.791
and I ain't ask you
to do shit for me.

32:37.832 --> 32:41.378
* *

32:41.419 --> 32:45.382
- Boy, I moved mountains
to give you a second chance.

32:45.423 --> 32:47.133
Show some damn gratitude.
- For what?

32:47.175 --> 32:49.511
So you can use me as a campaign
prop to show these rich people

32:49.552 --> 32:51.096
how much you care about
poor Black kids from the hood?

32:51.137 --> 32:52.472
- That wasn't the point, Will.
- Then you gonna send me home

32:52.514 --> 32:54.099
after you win
your little election?

32:54.140 --> 32:56.059
- Look, if I could put you on
a plane back to Philly tonight,

32:56.101 --> 32:57.894
I would.

32:57.936 --> 32:59.187
But I can't.

33:01.898 --> 33:03.650
We both know why.

33:03.692 --> 33:07.112
* *

33:07.153 --> 33:09.197
- How long am I
supposed to be here?

33:10.865 --> 33:13.201
- For the foreseeable future.

33:13.243 --> 33:15.286
So here's the story.

33:15.328 --> 33:17.163
You came to Bel-Air
for a better education.

33:17.205 --> 33:18.707
Simple.
- [sucks teeth]

33:21.376 --> 33:23.545
- I need you to say it, Will.

33:25.505 --> 33:27.757
- I came to Bel-Air
for a better education.

33:27.799 --> 33:29.551
There, I said it. Happy?

33:29.592 --> 33:31.052
- Look, if you don't like
the arrangement,

33:31.094 --> 33:33.638
you only have
yourself to blame.

33:33.680 --> 33:36.516
But this is how
it's gonna be from now on.

33:36.558 --> 33:38.435
I suggest you get used to it.

33:42.147 --> 33:43.648
You can go.

33:46.067 --> 33:49.029
[hip-hop music]

33:49.070 --> 33:56.036
* *

33:56.077 --> 33:58.246
[sighs]

33:58.288 --> 34:01.875
- [muttering angrily]

34:01.916 --> 34:03.460
Bullshit!

34:04.878 --> 34:06.212
Fuck!

34:06.254 --> 34:13.386
* *

34:15.555 --> 34:16.639
Fuck.

34:16.681 --> 34:20.560
* *

34:20.602 --> 34:21.811
- Yo, Will.

34:21.853 --> 34:23.521
- Bro, my fault
I ain't call you back, man.

34:23.563 --> 34:25.231
It's been a crazy-ass day.

34:25.273 --> 34:26.316
- Your mom told me
you got sprung out of jail,

34:26.358 --> 34:27.525
but she won't say where you at.

34:27.567 --> 34:28.943
You still in Philly, right?

34:28.985 --> 34:31.112
- Nah, bro.

34:31.154 --> 34:32.781
I'm in LA.
- LA?

34:32.822 --> 34:34.366
Man, stop capping, yo.

34:34.407 --> 34:36.451
- No cap, man.
This shit happened so quick.

34:36.493 --> 34:38.161
- Bro, Rashad's got
a bag on your head, bro.

34:38.203 --> 34:39.537
He's saying you snitched
to get out.

34:39.579 --> 34:40.622
- What?

34:40.663 --> 34:41.790
Bro, I ain't snitch
on nobody.

34:41.831 --> 34:43.708
- The hell you get out
of jail, then?

34:43.750 --> 34:46.169
- My uncle pulled
some crazy lawyer shit.

34:46.211 --> 34:48.004
That's all I know.

34:48.046 --> 34:49.756
- Rashad wants you dead, bro.

34:49.798 --> 34:51.466
I think I'm next.

34:51.508 --> 34:54.260
You gotta come back and
clear this shit up, like, ASAP.

34:54.302 --> 34:56.596
- Just be cool, a'ight?
Be cool and lay low.

34:56.638 --> 34:57.806
A'ight?

34:59.974 --> 35:02.143
- I'm scared, bro.

35:03.812 --> 35:05.939
- I'm coming.

35:05.980 --> 35:07.315
I'ma fix this.

35:09.317 --> 35:10.860
- All right, bro.

35:10.902 --> 35:17.826
* *

35:35.510 --> 35:36.761
- * I just Venmo'd a hooker *

35:36.803 --> 35:38.013
* My friends know
I'm a booger *

35:38.054 --> 35:39.597
* Cop something white
and sugary *

35:39.639 --> 35:40.974
* I think I'm Puff,
just look at me *

35:41.016 --> 35:42.767
* Feeling live
at the barbecue *

35:42.809 --> 35:44.269
* Shorty thick
Steve Harvey suit *

35:44.310 --> 35:45.812
* Grown and sexy,
no promises *

35:45.854 --> 35:47.689
* I ain't cute,
but my wallet is *

35:47.731 --> 35:49.441
- What the hell
is this Jackie Chan,

35:49.482 --> 35:52.277
"Splinter Cell" shit?

35:52.318 --> 35:53.862
- * Probably start a family *

35:53.903 --> 35:55.321
* I'm a bad boy,
let's coproduce *

35:55.363 --> 35:56.781
* Tell me
what's your fantasy *

35:56.823 --> 35:58.658
* ODB with the golden tooth *

35:58.700 --> 36:00.910
* *

36:00.952 --> 36:03.413
- [grunts] Yo, Jazz, man,
I gotta get to LAX, man.

36:03.455 --> 36:04.622
I gotta catch
a midnight flight to Philly.

36:04.664 --> 36:05.832
- Wait, you didn't
kill or rob nobody

36:05.874 --> 36:07.083
in that mansion, did you?

36:07.125 --> 36:08.460
'Cause I ain't trying
to catch a case, Will.

36:08.501 --> 36:09.627
- No, man, everybody
in the mansion is good.

36:09.669 --> 36:11.546
I just gotta get back home
ASAP, a'ight?

36:11.588 --> 36:13.757
Come on, let's go.
[banging on car]

36:13.798 --> 36:15.592
- But you're already
home, Will.

36:15.633 --> 36:17.552
- Shit.

36:19.012 --> 36:20.347
- Turn it off.

36:20.388 --> 36:22.265
[engine shuts off, music stops]

36:24.976 --> 36:26.394
- Wait, who are you?

36:26.436 --> 36:28.938
- Philip Banks, Will's uncle.

36:28.980 --> 36:30.190
Who the hell are you?

36:30.231 --> 36:33.985
- Uh, Jazz. What up?

36:34.027 --> 36:35.195
- Jazz.

36:44.454 --> 36:46.164
Thank you for your time, Jazz.

36:46.206 --> 36:48.208
- Thank you
for your money, Phil.

36:50.210 --> 36:51.711
- Let's go back inside, Will.

37:02.806 --> 37:04.349
I guess you missed
the 20 cameras

37:04.391 --> 37:05.850
surrounding the property.

37:07.852 --> 37:09.187
By the way,
what was the plan here?

37:09.229 --> 37:11.272
So you go to LAX
and then what?

37:11.314 --> 37:12.482
Hmm?

37:13.775 --> 37:17.112
- And then fly home
and fix my situation.

37:17.153 --> 37:18.863
- Hmm.

37:18.905 --> 37:21.908
What about that gangster
you pulled a gun on?

37:21.950 --> 37:25.370
I find it hard to believe
he'd just let that go.

37:25.412 --> 37:27.580
What was your plan there?

37:34.587 --> 37:37.674
Let me ask you something, Will.

37:37.716 --> 37:39.551
You care if you live or die?

37:44.973 --> 37:46.474
- Yeah.

37:48.226 --> 37:49.561
- Me too.

37:51.021 --> 37:52.313
So does your mom,

37:52.355 --> 37:54.524
your aunt,

37:54.566 --> 37:57.402
and everyone in this house.
- I can handle mine.

37:57.444 --> 37:59.529
I ain't never had no daddy.

37:59.571 --> 38:01.322
I been my own man.

38:02.657 --> 38:04.284
- A real man takes the time
to consider

38:04.325 --> 38:06.286
the consequences
of his actions.

38:07.954 --> 38:09.831
A real man knows
when to let go of his pride

38:09.873 --> 38:12.083
and make the most
out of a second chance.

38:13.084 --> 38:15.587
A real man also knows how
to look another man in the eye

38:15.628 --> 38:17.881
when they're saying something.
Look at me.

38:24.012 --> 38:25.430
I believe in you, Will.

38:27.515 --> 38:28.725
Be patient.

38:30.268 --> 38:33.438
Give this a real chance,
and I promise

38:33.480 --> 38:35.106
that you'll have
every opportunity

38:35.148 --> 38:36.441

the future you want.

39:23.029 --> 39:26.074
If we were his age, we would
have broken out of here too.

39:27.283 --> 39:28.410
Phil.

39:30.912 --> 39:31.955
Phil.

39:34.416 --> 39:36.167
I know it's not
the start we imagined,

39:36.209 --> 39:39.713
but we did the right thing
moving him out here.

39:41.339 --> 39:42.966

39:44.300 --> 39:45.593
I know.

39:51.683 --> 39:53.852
I doubt our good intentions
will sway a grand jury

39:53.893 --> 39:56.688
if this thing goes
off the rails with this kid.

39:56.730 --> 39:58.565
When I called in that favor
to get him out of jail,

39:58.606 --> 40:00.150
I crossed a line, Viv.

40:00.191 --> 40:02.819
His first day here and he's
already making matters worse.

40:02.861 --> 40:04.070

- You know he walked right up

40:04.112 --> 40:05.697

like a broken dam?

40:10.577 --> 40:12.495
Yeah, I think
Fred's suspicious.

40:12.537 --> 40:14.497
- Oh, stop it.
You're being paranoid now.

40:14.539 --> 40:16.374

40:31.139 --> 40:34.351
I still have my concerns
about all this.

40:34.392 --> 40:36.061
And, Viv,

40:36.102 --> 40:38.897

ever since his father--

40:44.277 --> 40:46.946
Hey, don't get me wrong.

40:46.988 --> 40:49.074
I want to help.

40:50.116 --> 40:52.494

three other kids in this house

40:52.535 --> 40:54.621

that's in full swing.

Well, that don't sound like
the West Philly GOAT I know.

- That's 'cause
I ain't in West Philly.

where you woke up yesterday.

41:54.264 --> 41:56.641
Now take a look around you.

where you'd rather be.

in Bel-Air.

for you, cuzzo.

- Hilary's an amazing cook.

43:04.668 --> 43:06.836
She's gonna take
"Haute Cuisine" by storm.

43:06.878 --> 43:11.508
- Oh!
"Haute Cuisine," nice.

43:11.549 --> 43:13.343
What's "Haute Cuisine"?

43:13.385 --> 43:16.179
- "Haute Cuisine" is the top
food magazine in the country,

43:16.221 --> 43:17.681
and I have an interview
with them next week.

43:17.722 --> 43:18.890

or is this just part
of the never-ending

43:26.272 --> 43:27.857
- Language.
- Chill, it was just a joke.

43:27.899 --> 43:29.234
- "Haute Cuisine"
is a huge step up

from the social media stuff
that she's been doing.

people like Connor every day?

It was challenging.

49:25.048 --> 49:26.257
- No.

I mean, it's easy
when you have money.

when I found my people.

who just let me be myself.
