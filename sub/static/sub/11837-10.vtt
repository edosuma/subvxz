WEBVTT

00:07.908 --> 00:10.243
Ah, Mr. Shore,
thank you for coming.

00:10.276 --> 00:12.312
Whatever it is,
I didn't do it.

00:12.345 --> 00:14.214
From what I've been told,
you probably did.

00:15.916 --> 00:17.117
Have a seat.

00:22.088 --> 00:23.590
There's a rumor going around,

00:23.624 --> 00:25.458
underneath that slick surface,

00:25.491 --> 00:26.693
there's a heart of gold.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.229
Completely untrue.

00:31.998 --> 00:33.299
I got a 19-year-old kid

00:33.333 --> 00:35.101
scheduled for a murder trial
tomorrow.

00:35.135 --> 00:37.370
He's just fired
his sixth attorney an hour ago

00:37.403 --> 00:40.173
and he's decided
to represent himself.

00:40.206 --> 00:42.308
It's my sense he hires
and fires lawyers

00:42.342 --> 00:44.210
to buy himself time, and...

00:44.244 --> 00:46.379
he's successfully done that
up till now.

00:47.514 --> 00:49.583
That trial
will go forward tomorrow.

00:49.616 --> 00:51.952
Are we getting to the part
that involves me?

00:51.985 --> 00:54.120
I'm assigning you
to be shadow counsel.

00:54.154 --> 00:56.557
Nuh-uh, I've had very little
of criminal experience,

00:56.590 --> 00:57.624
Your Honor.
ROBBINS: Well,

00:57.658 --> 00:58.992
you're about to get more.

00:59.025 --> 01:00.466
9:00.

01:00.501 --> 01:02.703
I'd love to accommodate you
but actually,

01:02.736 --> 01:05.772
I'm starting another trial
tomorrow morning, so--

01:05.806 --> 01:07.407
Who's the judge?
SHORE: Okubo.

01:07.440 --> 01:08.441
ROBBINS: Oh.

01:08.474 --> 01:09.275
Only thing you need to know

01:09.308 --> 01:10.777
about the honorable Amy Okubo

01:10.811 --> 01:12.679
is that I've got seniority
on her.

01:12.713 --> 01:14.314
You'll be in my courtroom
at 9:00.

01:14.347 --> 01:15.916
SHORE: She's ordered
no further continuances.

01:15.949 --> 01:19.720
ROBBINS: 9:00, Mr. Shore.

01:19.753 --> 01:21.287
All right, Your Honor.
Let's cut to it,

01:21.321 --> 01:24.024
I couldn't possibly
try a case

01:24.057 --> 01:25.759
in your courtroom.

01:25.792 --> 01:26.727
Because...

01:26.760 --> 01:28.394
I'm attracted to you.

01:30.230 --> 01:32.132
In fact, I'm...

01:32.165 --> 01:33.600
obsessed with you.

01:33.634 --> 01:36.537
I'm afraid my lust would...

01:36.570 --> 01:38.705
inhibit my ability to...

01:38.739 --> 01:40.306
fairly represent my client.

01:42.976 --> 01:45.145
You're attracted to me?

01:45.178 --> 01:46.346
Yes.

01:49.583 --> 01:51.552
Could you lean forward a bit?

02:01.101 --> 02:04.270
You are a very sexy man

02:05.338 --> 02:07.307
and a clever one

02:07.340 --> 02:09.943
capable of feigning
an attraction for a judge

02:09.976 --> 02:12.012
just to get yourself off a case.

02:14.047 --> 02:16.916
9:00.

02:18.484 --> 02:20.587
I will be getting myself off.

02:20.621 --> 02:21.755
I assure you.

02:23.389 --> 02:26.126
9:00.

02:30.063 --> 02:32.999
(music playing)

03:11.778 --> 03:12.946
FRUTT: Shadow counsel?

03:12.979 --> 03:14.247
SHORE: The problem is
I'm already scheduled

03:14.280 --> 03:15.849
for a trial
before Judge Okubo,

03:15.882 --> 03:17.117
who will be anything
but pleased.

03:17.150 --> 03:18.985
Well, what do you want me
to do?

03:19.019 --> 03:19.753
SHORE: Try to get a continuance,

03:19.786 --> 03:20.987
which won't be easy.

03:21.021 --> 03:22.789
And then there's the client
himself,

03:22.823 --> 03:24.124
Mr. Tang Jingyu.

03:24.157 --> 03:25.792
Tang Jing who?

03:25.826 --> 03:26.927
Tara knows the case.

03:26.960 --> 03:28.094
She'll go with you.

03:28.128 --> 03:29.596
Just try and get it pushed
till next week.

03:29.630 --> 03:30.831
I'll really appreciate it.

03:32.498 --> 03:34.200
Tang who?

03:38.238 --> 03:39.405
(alarm buzzes)

03:40.507 --> 03:41.708
Thank you.

03:41.742 --> 03:42.442
Hello, Marshall.

03:42.475 --> 03:44.244
I'm Alan Shore.

03:44.277 --> 03:46.012
I'm representing myself.

03:46.046 --> 03:47.413
That's what I told her.

03:47.447 --> 03:50.350
I understand, but she asked me
to be shadow counsel,

03:50.383 --> 03:51.952
which basically means
I see to it

03:51.985 --> 03:54.555
that you screw yourself over
a little less rather than more.

03:55.622 --> 03:57.123
So, what's wrong
with all these attorneys

03:57.157 --> 03:58.158
you've been firing?

03:58.191 --> 03:59.960
They keep asking me
to plead out,

03:59.993 --> 04:02.035
which I don't want to do.

04:02.068 --> 04:02.836
Fair enough.

04:04.304 --> 04:06.840
You're alleged to have shot
and killed somebody.

04:06.873 --> 04:07.608
Did you?

04:07.641 --> 04:08.809
Yes.

04:08.842 --> 04:10.977
In front of an eyewitness?

04:11.011 --> 04:11.745
Yes.

04:12.979 --> 04:14.515
This would explain
why the lawyers

04:14.548 --> 04:15.849
were suggesting a plea.

04:17.382 --> 04:18.483
Look, Mister, uh--

04:18.519 --> 04:20.153
Shore, but you
can call me Michael.

04:20.185 --> 04:21.622
You said your name was Alan.

04:21.654 --> 04:23.356
SHORE: Excellent.
You pay attention.

04:23.389 --> 04:24.157
This will help.

04:26.026 --> 04:28.428
Listen closely, Marshall,

04:28.461 --> 04:30.931
after just a cursory view
of the facts,

04:30.964 --> 04:32.899
my guess is you'll be
found guilty.

04:32.933 --> 04:35.034
If you insist
on representing yourself,

04:35.068 --> 04:36.736
it's over.

04:36.770 --> 04:38.805
Then I have to fire
your ass, too.

04:41.107 --> 04:43.577
It may shock you to learn
I make for a better lawyer

04:43.610 --> 04:45.746
than your average
19-year-old crackhead.

04:45.779 --> 04:47.047
I could be wrong.

04:48.649 --> 04:49.650
If you don't want to plead,

04:49.683 --> 04:51.284
fine, don't,

04:51.317 --> 04:52.819
but if you're going to go
to trial,

04:52.853 --> 04:54.755
use a trained professional.

04:54.788 --> 04:55.922
Don't be a complete idiot.

04:55.956 --> 04:56.923
It's beneath you.

05:00.501 --> 05:01.735
JINGYU: What happened, Shore?

05:01.768 --> 05:04.070
Mr. Shore got called in
on an emergency matter.

05:04.104 --> 05:06.239
We're gonna try to push
your case until next week.

05:06.272 --> 05:08.374
I don't anticipate that
to be a problem, but, then--

05:08.408 --> 05:10.043
I knew Shore not care.

05:10.076 --> 05:11.745
That's not true, Mr. Tang.

05:11.778 --> 05:13.346
Mr. Shore cares very much.

05:13.379 --> 05:14.347
No one care.

05:14.380 --> 05:15.682
People think big joke.

05:15.716 --> 05:17.083
WILSON: Mr. Tang...

05:17.117 --> 05:19.252
I know that you know
that I care.

05:19.285 --> 05:20.386
Shore think joke.

05:21.487 --> 05:22.455
Look at me.

05:24.357 --> 05:26.693
We will get the continuance,

05:26.727 --> 05:29.062
and everything will be fine.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.236
Are you kidding me?

05:36.269 --> 05:39.172
This case is marked
"No further continuances."

05:39.205 --> 05:40.841
FRUTT: Your Honor,
we are ready,

05:40.874 --> 05:42.509
but Mr. Shore was suddenly
called in on a homicide.

05:42.543 --> 05:44.745
OKUBO: I do not care
where Mr. Shore is.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.680
I am angry about
where Mr. Shore isn't.

05:46.713 --> 05:49.716
This matter has been
on my docket for five years.

05:49.750 --> 05:50.884
I understand that, but--

05:50.917 --> 05:52.018
OKUBO: Alan Shore

05:52.052 --> 05:54.120
is the fourth attorney
of record,

05:54.154 --> 05:56.422
following Robert Donnell,
Lindsay Dole,

05:56.456 --> 05:57.724
and Rebecca Washington.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.893
You now make number five.

05:59.926 --> 06:02.135
I don't enjoy lawyers
playing turf ball

06:02.168 --> 06:03.136
in my court.

06:03.169 --> 06:05.171
That's not going on,
I assure you.

06:05.205 --> 06:07.908
Judge Robbins ordered him
to shadow-counsel on a--

06:07.941 --> 06:10.310
OKUBO: Judge Robbins
does not control my courtroom.

06:10.343 --> 06:11.912
FRUTT: Your Honor,
we're just stuck

06:11.945 --> 06:13.046
in the middle here.

06:13.079 --> 06:14.981
OKUBO: This is a two
or three day trial, max,

06:15.015 --> 06:17.483
and it's a stupid case
to begin with.

06:17.518 --> 06:19.485
Not stupid. Object!

06:19.520 --> 06:21.221
Mr. Tang...

06:21.254 --> 06:22.556
the court respects your right

06:22.589 --> 06:24.625
to have your day in court,

06:24.658 --> 06:27.628
so I'm giving it
to you right now.

06:27.661 --> 06:29.162
Your Honor--
OKUBO: You either say

06:29.195 --> 06:31.798
"Ready for trial,"
or we dismiss this complaint.

06:31.832 --> 06:32.733
Your choice.

06:35.335 --> 06:36.402
Ready for trial.

06:42.042 --> 06:43.076
What happened now?

06:43.109 --> 06:44.811
There is no reason
to panic.

06:44.845 --> 06:46.179
Case not know.

06:46.212 --> 06:47.147
I'm sorry?

06:47.180 --> 06:48.982
You--case not know.
Up creek!

06:49.015 --> 06:50.951
Mr. Tang--
JINGYU: Case not know.

06:50.984 --> 06:52.085
Male puppet!

06:52.118 --> 06:53.153
Excuse me?

06:53.186 --> 06:55.522
I think that he means
"Malpractice."

06:55.556 --> 06:58.024
His English isn't very good.

06:58.058 --> 06:59.292
Wait five years.

06:59.325 --> 07:00.901
WILSON: Mr. Tang,

07:00.934 --> 07:03.403
I will be there every step.

07:03.436 --> 07:04.270
I promise.

07:05.872 --> 07:07.808
Excuse me one second, sir.

07:09.375 --> 07:12.546
Tara, do you think
you could possibly try this?

07:15.115 --> 07:16.116
Me?

07:16.149 --> 07:17.150
But I'm not even a member--

07:17.183 --> 07:18.151
Third-year law students

07:18.184 --> 07:19.953
with supervision can try--

07:19.986 --> 07:22.022
WILSON: But that's criminal,
not civil.

07:22.055 --> 07:23.557
FRUTT: I will be doing it
with you,

07:23.590 --> 07:24.958
and the judge will sign off.

07:24.991 --> 07:26.492
Tara, he's right.

07:26.527 --> 07:27.894
With me, it's...

07:27.928 --> 07:29.462
"up creek."

07:29.495 --> 07:30.697
You know the medicals.

07:30.731 --> 07:31.632
You've researched the law.

07:31.665 --> 07:33.199
You seem to have
a good connection

07:33.233 --> 07:34.200
with the client.

07:34.234 --> 07:37.971
But I have never tried
a case before,

07:38.004 --> 07:39.205
ever.

07:39.239 --> 07:41.207
Everybody has a first time.

07:41.241 --> 07:43.309
Look, you are up
to speed here.

07:43.343 --> 07:44.410
I am not.

07:44.444 --> 07:45.445
Just get us through the day,

07:45.478 --> 07:48.214
and then maybe Alan
can take over.

07:51.985 --> 07:55.121
The evidence will show that
once the drug deal went bad,

07:55.155 --> 07:56.489
the defendant drew a weapon,

07:56.523 --> 07:58.058
a 38-caliber revolver,

07:58.091 --> 07:59.926
and fired three shots

07:59.960 --> 08:01.467
into the victim,

08:01.502 --> 08:02.503
killing him.

08:02.536 --> 08:03.737
You'll hear from an eyewitness

08:03.770 --> 08:07.007
who saw Marshall Bagnelle
commit this crime.

08:07.040 --> 08:08.809
You'll hear from an expert
in ballistics

08:08.842 --> 08:10.811
who will tell you
that the bullets

08:10.844 --> 08:12.913
retrieved from the victim's body

08:12.946 --> 08:16.449
match the gun found later
in the defendant's possession.

08:16.482 --> 08:19.219
And after all this evidence
is presented,

08:19.252 --> 08:22.889
it will be established
beyond all reasonable doubt

08:22.923 --> 08:26.326
that Marshall Bagnelle
committed murder.

08:36.001 --> 08:37.604
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen,

08:38.639 --> 08:41.041
Your Honor.
Mr. Shore.

08:42.442 --> 08:45.145
I was drafted for this trial,

08:45.178 --> 08:48.281
much like all of you
were summoned for jury duty.

08:48.314 --> 08:49.482
And my reaction was,

08:49.516 --> 08:50.316
"Damn it,

08:50.350 --> 08:51.952
I have better things to do

08:51.985 --> 08:54.254
than sit around
in a courtroom all day."

08:54.287 --> 08:56.122
Show of hands, how many of you
felt burdened by--

08:56.156 --> 08:56.990
Objection.

08:57.023 --> 08:57.991
Counsel.

08:58.024 --> 09:00.601
But then, I found out

09:00.634 --> 09:02.102
it's a murder trial.

09:02.135 --> 09:03.670
And part of me went,

09:03.704 --> 09:05.939
"Oh, boy," inside,
because murder trials,

09:05.972 --> 09:07.073
they can be juicy.

09:08.141 --> 09:09.309
How many of you went,
"Oh, boy"?

09:09.342 --> 09:10.143
Objection.

09:10.176 --> 09:11.311
Mr. Shore.

09:11.344 --> 09:12.879
SHORE: And the great thing

09:12.913 --> 09:14.948
about this particular
murder trial,

09:14.981 --> 09:16.482
there's no real tragedy.

09:16.517 --> 09:18.018
The victim was a drug dealer.

09:18.051 --> 09:19.620
My client is a drug dealer.

09:19.653 --> 09:20.754
One is dead,

09:20.787 --> 09:22.889
another we can send
to prison for life,

09:22.923 --> 09:24.424
it's a win-win.

09:24.457 --> 09:26.192
So let's sit back,

09:26.226 --> 09:27.393
relax...

09:27.427 --> 09:29.095
enjoy ourselves, shall we?

09:29.129 --> 09:30.831
One lowlife down, one to go.

09:32.666 --> 09:34.234
That concludes
my opening statement.

09:44.945 --> 09:46.747
How am I doing so far?

09:55.589 --> 09:57.357
TAMARA: Mr. Shore.

09:57.390 --> 09:59.225
Yes?
I'm Tamara Bagnelle,

09:59.259 --> 09:59.993
Marshall's mother.

10:00.026 --> 10:01.367
Oh. Very nice to meet you.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.811
Was that sexual?

10:10.844 --> 10:13.246
My son is on trial
for his life,

10:13.279 --> 10:15.148
and your opening statement--

10:15.181 --> 10:18.018
Ms. Bagnelle, I assure you
I have a plan here.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.886
Which is...

10:19.920 --> 10:21.021
Okay, I lied.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.856
I don't have a plan,
but I'm forming one.

10:26.259 --> 10:29.262
Nobody slaps me twice,
Ms. Bagnelle,

10:29.295 --> 10:30.797
at least not in the face.

10:33.834 --> 10:36.369
FRUTT: I will make
the evidentiary objections.

10:36.402 --> 10:38.839
All you need to do
is ask him what happened.

10:38.872 --> 10:39.940
Don't lead,

10:39.973 --> 10:42.242
just basically say,
"What happened next?"

10:42.275 --> 10:43.877
And let him tell his story.
Okay.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.512
FRUTT: And don't move
around a lot, Tara.

10:45.546 --> 10:47.380
Just plant your feet,
stay still.

10:47.413 --> 10:48.414
Why?

10:48.448 --> 10:50.116
FRUTT: Because we want
the jurors' eyes

10:50.150 --> 10:51.585
to be on him as he testifies.

10:51.618 --> 10:54.187
His story is basically
our whole case.

10:54.220 --> 10:56.657
You're moving around
could be distracting.

10:56.690 --> 10:59.159
Now, if he starts
to get too hot,

10:59.192 --> 11:00.934
which is a very likely
possibility,

11:00.967 --> 11:03.103
you may have to calm him down
a little bit.

11:05.606 --> 11:07.073
Have bad feeling.

11:07.107 --> 11:08.742
Mr. Tang,

11:08.775 --> 11:10.110
you just need to relax.

11:10.143 --> 11:12.579
Tara will basically ask you
what happened.

11:12.613 --> 11:15.148
Just tell the jury
in your own words.

11:16.349 --> 11:17.918
And a few of ours might help.

11:17.951 --> 11:19.920
What?
Nothing.

11:19.953 --> 11:21.522
Make fun I talk.

11:21.555 --> 11:24.257
You do have an accent,
Mr. Tang,

11:24.290 --> 11:26.560
so please try
and speak slowly.

11:27.694 --> 11:29.329
If you need to ask
a question twice,

11:29.362 --> 11:31.965
don't be afraid to.

11:31.998 --> 11:33.133
You can do this.

11:34.300 --> 11:35.268
I'm ready.

11:39.305 --> 11:41.708
They got into an argument
over the price.

11:41.742 --> 11:43.343
The price of the cocaine?

11:43.376 --> 11:45.546
MILLS: Yes. I mean, I really
wasn't paying attention.

11:45.579 --> 11:46.713
I was watching television

11:46.747 --> 11:48.348
and the next thing I know,

11:48.381 --> 11:49.950
he's got a gun.

11:49.983 --> 11:51.818
The defendant?

11:51.852 --> 11:53.053
MILLS: Yes.

11:53.086 --> 11:55.822
He pulls out this gun
and he's screaming

11:55.856 --> 11:56.623
and I think,

11:56.657 --> 11:59.025
"Okay, now it's a robbery,"

11:59.059 --> 12:01.768
you know, that he's just
gonna steal the stuff outright.

12:01.802 --> 12:03.236
TOOMEY: What did you do here?

12:03.269 --> 12:05.706
I basically just started
screaming, you know, that,

12:05.739 --> 12:07.040
"He's got a gun,"

12:07.073 --> 12:09.375
and that's when Brian
went for his gun

12:09.409 --> 12:11.411
and that's when it happened.

12:11.444 --> 12:13.980
He shot him three times.

12:14.014 --> 12:16.049
He just killed Brian
right there.

12:16.082 --> 12:19.052
TOOMEY: Now Andrea,
and this is important,

12:19.085 --> 12:21.988
when did Brian get his gun
in relation to when--

12:22.022 --> 12:23.489
I just said
that Brian got his gun

12:23.524 --> 12:25.792
after that man
pulled a gun out on him.

12:25.826 --> 12:27.360
And before Brian could even
get his gun,

12:27.393 --> 12:28.829
he just started shooting.

12:28.862 --> 12:31.164
It's a miracle
he didn't kill me, too.

12:31.197 --> 12:33.734
And then he just took
the stuff and left.

12:36.036 --> 12:37.237
Thank you, Andrea.

12:48.949 --> 12:52.218
Drugs are a horrible thing,
Andrea, wouldn't you agree?

12:52.252 --> 12:53.286
Yes.

12:53.987 --> 12:54.655
Did you ever use them?

12:56.022 --> 12:58.525
I wasn't using that night,
if that's what you're going for.

12:58.559 --> 13:01.001
My capacity for observation
was perfect.

13:01.034 --> 13:02.468
That's a legal term.

13:02.503 --> 13:03.604
Are you a lawyer, Andrea?

13:03.637 --> 13:05.205
No.

13:05.238 --> 13:06.673
Huh.

13:06.707 --> 13:08.241
Have you by any chance
spoken to a lawyer

13:08.274 --> 13:09.876
before testifying, say...

13:09.910 --> 13:11.344
a district attorney?
Objection.

13:11.377 --> 13:12.513
I'm merely trying
to establish

13:12.546 --> 13:13.614
that you put words
in her mouth.

13:13.647 --> 13:15.115
Objection.
Sustained.

13:15.148 --> 13:17.317
Andrea, there were drugs
on the premises that night,

13:17.350 --> 13:18.952
weren't there?
Obviously.

13:18.985 --> 13:20.787
SHORE: And since you were there
on the premises,

13:20.821 --> 13:21.988
what were you watching,
by the way?

13:22.022 --> 13:23.056
Joe Millionaire.

13:23.089 --> 13:25.291
Ah, figures.

13:25.325 --> 13:27.894
And since you were present
with these drugs,

13:27.928 --> 13:30.263
you were exposed
to criminal charges as well,

13:30.296 --> 13:31.297
weren't you?

13:32.666 --> 13:34.334
Might have been nice
to have something

13:34.367 --> 13:37.671
to offer the police,
I bet something like say...

13:37.704 --> 13:38.639
testimony.

13:38.672 --> 13:41.141
I'm telling it
like it happened.

13:41.174 --> 13:42.909
SHORE: What was your
relationship with Brian

13:42.943 --> 13:44.044
the drug dealer?

13:44.077 --> 13:46.212
He was my boyfriend.
SHORE: Your boyfriend?

13:46.246 --> 13:47.814
Brian the drug dealer
was your boyfriend?

13:47.848 --> 13:48.682
Yes.

13:48.715 --> 13:51.852
Well, you didn't
establish that.

13:51.885 --> 13:53.053
That might make you biased.

13:53.086 --> 13:54.821
I'm telling the truth.

13:54.855 --> 13:56.823
You said that you weren't
using that night.

13:56.857 --> 13:59.159
You do use though,
don't you, Andrea?

13:59.192 --> 14:01.234
Recreationally,
occasionally.

14:01.267 --> 14:03.203
Ever get arrested?

14:03.236 --> 14:05.338
Once.
For using or dealing?

14:05.371 --> 14:06.239
Dealing.

14:06.272 --> 14:08.008
Oh, so you're a drug dealer too.

14:09.242 --> 14:11.077
Oh, well, tell me,
with Brian dead,

14:11.111 --> 14:12.212
do you pick up his business?

14:12.245 --> 14:13.246
TOOMEY: Objection!

14:13.279 --> 14:14.080
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

14:14.114 --> 14:15.081
My client wants to know.

14:15.115 --> 14:17.017
He needs a new connection.

14:17.050 --> 14:18.351
ROBBINS: Mr. Shore,

14:18.384 --> 14:19.720
will you step up here, please?

14:26.693 --> 14:28.629
Is this the way
you defend your client?

14:28.662 --> 14:30.096
It is, Your Honor.

14:35.135 --> 14:36.102
Pull over.

14:36.136 --> 14:37.203
Get gas.

14:37.237 --> 14:38.271
Need pee.

14:38.304 --> 14:40.206
You needed to pee?

14:40.240 --> 14:42.809
Yes, long drive, need pee.

14:42.843 --> 14:45.912
WILSON: Okay, so, can you
tell us what happened next?

14:45.946 --> 14:48.448
Bathroom painted.

14:48.481 --> 14:50.016
Man say, "Be careful."

14:50.050 --> 14:51.852
Flesh paint on wall,

14:51.885 --> 14:53.620
advise not go in.

14:53.654 --> 14:55.055
But you did?

14:55.088 --> 14:57.123
Objection, leading.

14:57.157 --> 14:59.726
Can you tell us
what happened next, sir?

14:59.760 --> 15:00.534
Need pee bad.

15:00.567 --> 15:01.968
Go in anyway.

15:02.002 --> 15:03.737
WILSON:
And then what happened?

15:03.770 --> 15:05.171
Sit on toilet,

15:06.239 --> 15:07.774
do business,

15:07.808 --> 15:10.376
then decide have cigarette.

15:11.477 --> 15:12.579
Long drive.

15:12.613 --> 15:14.314
Need relax.

15:20.987 --> 15:22.656
Go lift off!
Explode!

15:23.790 --> 15:25.458
What happened to you, sir?

15:25.491 --> 15:27.493
Knocked unconscious.

15:27.528 --> 15:28.529
Bottom buttocks--

15:28.562 --> 15:31.164
bottom burned red, raw.

15:31.197 --> 15:34.000
Raw skinned bottom,
burned red raw.

15:36.503 --> 15:37.838
Were you taken to hospital?

15:37.871 --> 15:39.472
JINGYU: Yes, hospital.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.341
Bottom burned red raw.

15:41.374 --> 15:43.376
WILSON: You must have been--

15:43.409 --> 15:45.646
you must have been
terrified, sir.

15:45.679 --> 15:46.913
JINGYU: Not funny!

15:46.947 --> 15:48.515
Blow off toilet bowl!

15:49.583 --> 15:50.951
Not funny!

16:02.002 --> 16:05.038
I am so, so sorry.

16:05.071 --> 16:06.973
I think that I was just
so anxious to begin with,

16:07.007 --> 16:08.474
that plus, his accent,

16:08.509 --> 16:10.043
and the nature
of the accident, I just--

16:10.076 --> 16:13.346
FRUTT: The jury now thinks
it's a big joke, Tara.

16:13.379 --> 16:15.816
This man had
third-degree burns.

16:15.849 --> 16:18.118
He has waited five years
to get into court,

16:18.151 --> 16:20.521
and his own lawyer
has likely caused the jury

16:20.554 --> 16:22.656
to completely trivialize
this matter.

16:22.689 --> 16:25.058
Ellenor, you know that
I never intended--

16:31.565 --> 16:33.066
Mr. Tang...

16:33.099 --> 16:35.669
I am so, so sorry.

16:38.271 --> 16:40.173
I deeply apologize.

16:47.247 --> 16:48.515
You're trying
to get me convicted.

16:48.549 --> 16:49.883
I promise you, I'm not.

16:49.916 --> 16:51.484
You said I need
a new connection?

16:51.518 --> 16:52.252
What's up with that?

16:52.285 --> 16:53.453
Calm down, Marshall.

16:53.486 --> 16:55.188
I was merely
trying to demonstrate

16:55.221 --> 16:57.724
to the jury that
I don't like you.

16:57.758 --> 16:59.059
You see, they don't like you.

16:59.092 --> 17:01.067
You shot somebody three times.

17:01.101 --> 17:03.036
They naturally consider you
despicable,

17:03.069 --> 17:05.137
so by showing them
I find you despicable,

17:05.171 --> 17:07.107
it makes me more relatable
to them.

17:07.140 --> 17:08.642
It gives me some credibility,

17:08.675 --> 17:10.511
so when I say,
at the end of all this,

17:10.544 --> 17:11.645
"Find him not guilty,"

17:11.678 --> 17:13.946
I might have a chance
of convincing them.

17:20.319 --> 17:22.454
I'm a human being, Mr. Shore.

17:23.757 --> 17:24.590
No, you're not.

17:24.625 --> 17:25.925
You're a drug addict.

17:31.164 --> 17:32.298
You'll testify next,

17:32.332 --> 17:34.067
then I'll call
character witnesses.

17:36.637 --> 17:39.773
You just need to do
as I tell you, Marshall,

17:39.806 --> 17:40.974
nothing more.

17:43.009 --> 17:44.978
And tell your mother
to stop hitting me.

17:54.420 --> 17:57.023
MARSHALL: She was right about us
arguing over the price.

17:57.057 --> 17:58.358
He wanted way too much,

17:58.391 --> 18:00.166
one and a half
of the street value.

18:00.200 --> 18:01.502
So you shot him?

18:02.803 --> 18:04.270
We got into a yelling match.

18:04.304 --> 18:05.772
We both got a little hot.

18:05.806 --> 18:06.873
So you shot him?

18:06.907 --> 18:09.042
I didn't just shoot him.

18:09.075 --> 18:10.677
SHORE: Well,
tell us what happened, sir,

18:10.711 --> 18:11.745
but if you don't mind,

18:11.778 --> 18:13.379
just fast-forward
to the good part.

18:14.480 --> 18:15.582
I just said, "That's it."

18:15.616 --> 18:17.651
I wanted to call
the whole deal off.

18:17.684 --> 18:19.720
That's when he pulled back
his jacket

18:19.753 --> 18:21.487
to show that he was packing.

18:21.522 --> 18:22.889
SHORE: Packing?

18:22.923 --> 18:24.758
For those of us
who don't carry a firearm,

18:24.791 --> 18:26.960
"packing" means,
"he had a gun."

18:26.993 --> 18:27.794
Yeah.

18:27.828 --> 18:29.395
SHORE: And, at some point,

18:29.429 --> 18:32.298
did you show him
that you were packing?

18:32.332 --> 18:33.734
Yes.

18:33.767 --> 18:35.769
I pulled out my gun
to show him that, you know,

18:35.802 --> 18:37.337
I wasn't intimidated.

18:37.370 --> 18:39.640
And I saw his eyes flash,
and he pulled his gun,

18:39.673 --> 18:41.407
and it wasn't just to show me
he had it.

18:41.441 --> 18:42.709
Now, he drew,

18:42.743 --> 18:44.410
so I pointed my gun at him,

18:44.444 --> 18:45.746
and yelled, "Don't!"

18:45.779 --> 18:47.514
but his gun is in his hand,

18:47.548 --> 18:50.183
about to--pointed at me,
about to shoot me.

18:50.216 --> 18:51.685
So I figured, you know,

18:51.718 --> 18:54.287
either I shoot or I'm dead,

18:54.320 --> 18:55.488
so I shot.

18:56.957 --> 18:59.993
I fired three times real quick
and he went down.

19:00.026 --> 19:01.768
He drew his gun.

19:01.802 --> 19:02.836
MARSHALL: Yes.

19:02.869 --> 19:04.938
If I hadn't fired, I'd be dead.

19:04.971 --> 19:07.207
SHORE: Did you know
that Brian the drug dealer

19:07.240 --> 19:09.710
was suspected of murdering
somebody before?

19:09.743 --> 19:11.745
TOOMEY: Objection--the victim
had never been charged

19:11.778 --> 19:13.680
in any homicide before,
and counsel is well--

19:13.714 --> 19:14.715
SHORE: Rephrase.

19:14.748 --> 19:16.416
Did you know that Brian
the drug dealer

19:16.449 --> 19:18.184
had never actually been charged

19:18.218 --> 19:20.120
with shooting a woman
twice in the head, blowing--

19:20.153 --> 19:21.087
TOOMEY: Objection.

19:21.121 --> 19:23.156
The victim
was briefly investigated

19:23.189 --> 19:24.190
in a drug-related killing,

19:24.224 --> 19:25.425
and that is all.

19:25.458 --> 19:27.193
He never became
the actual suspect,

19:27.227 --> 19:29.663
and I object
to this blatant distortion

19:29.696 --> 19:30.597
of the facts.

19:30.631 --> 19:32.699
Can't we all just get along?

19:32.733 --> 19:34.100
ROBBINS: Mr. Shore.

19:36.770 --> 19:39.405
What, if anything, did you know
about Brian the drug dealer?

19:39.439 --> 19:40.707
I have to ask it like that,

19:40.741 --> 19:42.943
but please, get in what
I want you to get in there.

19:42.976 --> 19:43.777
TOOMEY: Objection!

19:43.810 --> 19:45.011
Mr. Shore.

19:45.045 --> 19:46.947
There was a rumor
that he had capped a girl

19:46.980 --> 19:47.914
during a drug buy.

19:47.948 --> 19:49.516
I know that.
SHORE: Thank you.

19:49.550 --> 19:51.117
That wasn't so hard, was it?

19:52.185 --> 19:53.219
(clears throat)

19:55.288 --> 19:57.558
How many times have you been
arrested, Mr. Bagnelle?

19:57.591 --> 19:59.292
Five or six.

19:59.325 --> 20:01.001
TOOMEY: Actually,
it's seven.

20:01.034 --> 20:03.670
You brought a concealed weapon
to this drug transaction?

20:03.704 --> 20:07.808
Yes, because sometimes stuff
goes down like it has now.

20:07.841 --> 20:09.042
I need to protect myself.

20:09.075 --> 20:10.944
TOOMEY: Oh, you need
to protect yourself?

20:10.977 --> 20:14.047
SHORE: Objection. There's no
call for sarcasm, Your Honor.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.782
Sustained.

20:15.816 --> 20:17.884
TOOMEY: You didn't report
this shooting, did you, sir?

20:17.918 --> 20:19.452
You fled the scene.

20:19.485 --> 20:21.321
I figured his girlfriend
would report it.

20:21.354 --> 20:22.388
TOOMEY:
But if you were innocent,

20:22.422 --> 20:25.759
if it truly were self-defense,

20:25.792 --> 20:26.893
why run away?

20:26.927 --> 20:28.094
It was a drug deal.

20:28.128 --> 20:29.563
TOOMEY: Yes, a drug deal

20:29.596 --> 20:32.132
where there was a dispute
over price.

20:32.165 --> 20:33.767
Now, you had argued
with the victim before

20:33.800 --> 20:34.968
over price, hadn't you, sir?

20:35.001 --> 20:36.269
He was a gouger.

20:36.302 --> 20:38.004
But this time,
you'd had enough.

20:38.038 --> 20:40.006
You went carrying a gun.

20:40.040 --> 20:42.142
You shot him three times--
MARSHALL: In self-defense.

20:42.175 --> 20:44.545
Objection.
TOOMEY: Did he ever fire at you?

20:44.578 --> 20:46.613
No, but what am I suppose--
TOOMEY: And you didn't wait,

20:46.647 --> 20:48.048
did you, sir?
I would have been dead.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.516
SHORE: So many questions.

20:49.550 --> 20:50.651
May I ask a question?

20:50.684 --> 20:51.685
I forgot one.

20:53.286 --> 20:55.021
You were advised,
were you not, sir,

20:55.055 --> 20:56.590
not to go into the bathroom?

20:56.623 --> 20:58.759
Not advised on explode.

20:58.792 --> 21:00.233
Advised on paint.

21:00.266 --> 21:01.902
You can read English, Mr. Tang?

21:01.935 --> 21:02.969
Yes.

21:03.003 --> 21:04.037
Did you see the signs
that said

21:04.070 --> 21:04.771
"No smoking"?

21:04.805 --> 21:05.639
No.

21:05.672 --> 21:06.439
You didn't see any

21:06.472 --> 21:07.407
of the posted signs?

21:07.440 --> 21:08.274
No.

21:08.308 --> 21:09.676
Is that a truthful response,
sir?

21:09.710 --> 21:10.977
Yes, true.

21:11.011 --> 21:12.412
Why not object? Badger.

21:12.445 --> 21:14.014
LAWYER: I'm not trying
to badger you, sir.

21:14.047 --> 21:15.281
Did it not occur to you

21:15.315 --> 21:16.717
smoking a cigarette,

21:16.750 --> 21:19.019
lighting a match
at a gas station,

21:19.052 --> 21:20.453
that this could be dangerous?

21:20.486 --> 21:23.323
People smoke in bathroom
all time.

21:23.356 --> 21:24.290
They do?

21:24.324 --> 21:27.027
Yes, place to relax,

21:27.060 --> 21:28.529
go pee,

21:28.562 --> 21:30.531
loose pants, smoke.

21:30.564 --> 21:32.132
LAWYER: But you knew, sir,
that this bathroom

21:32.165 --> 21:33.433
had just been painted,

21:33.466 --> 21:34.768
that there could be
fumes inside.

21:34.801 --> 21:36.570
Not expect boom like that.

21:36.603 --> 21:38.404
Bottom burned red raw.

21:38.438 --> 21:40.273
Explode anus!

21:40.306 --> 21:41.975
LAWYER: You don't accept
any blame for this?

21:42.008 --> 21:44.645
JINGYU: Badger--why not object?
Male puppet.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.913
Look, she laugh--make joke.

21:46.947 --> 21:47.681
Male puppets!

21:47.714 --> 21:49.616
Male puppets!

21:49.650 --> 21:52.586
(speaking foreign language)

21:52.619 --> 21:54.487
OKUBO: Mr. Tang!
(speaks foreign language)

21:54.521 --> 21:57.190
Mr. Tang!
Not fair! Not fair!

22:07.340 --> 22:08.909
Mr. Tang--
Not care.

22:18.418 --> 22:19.352
What happen now?

22:19.385 --> 22:22.255
Well, we go
to closing arguments.

22:22.288 --> 22:24.057
Defense not put case?

22:24.090 --> 22:26.392
The defense rested,

22:26.426 --> 22:28.629
evidently, believing
that we didn't make our case.

22:30.731 --> 22:33.333
Sometimes, that's employed
as a strategy.

22:40.306 --> 22:42.709
This must be very difficult
for you, ma'am,

22:42.743 --> 22:44.344
your son on trial for murder.

22:44.377 --> 22:45.512
It is.

22:45.546 --> 22:48.414
I'm sure you must feel,
as many of us do,

22:48.448 --> 22:50.083
it's all your fault.

22:50.116 --> 22:51.618
You were never home.

22:51.652 --> 22:52.553
I had to work.

22:52.586 --> 22:54.054
SHORE: He never knew his father.

22:54.087 --> 22:56.156
You have to be somewhat
to blame for that.

22:56.189 --> 22:57.423
How about his probation officer,

22:57.457 --> 22:59.259
ever meet with him?
No.

22:59.292 --> 23:00.801
SHORE: Ever try to get
your son into any kind

23:00.834 --> 23:02.235
of drug rehab program?

23:02.268 --> 23:04.505
TAMARA: We didn't have money
for that.

23:04.538 --> 23:06.272
I tried to do all I could.

23:06.306 --> 23:07.107
Move to strike.

23:07.140 --> 23:08.208
Counsel.

23:08.241 --> 23:09.610
SHORE: I note he got thrown
out of school

23:09.643 --> 23:10.443
his sophomore year.

23:10.476 --> 23:11.477
Why?

23:12.813 --> 23:14.214
Drugs.

23:14.247 --> 23:15.982
SHORE: Did his principal
come by to explain?

23:16.016 --> 23:17.818
TAMARA: No,
it was zero tolerance.

23:17.851 --> 23:19.485
He just got expelled.

23:19.520 --> 23:21.555
He sounds like an awful child.

23:22.956 --> 23:24.224
Just between us,

23:24.257 --> 23:25.191
glad to be rid of him?

23:27.761 --> 23:29.229
That's quite a look
you're giving me.

23:29.262 --> 23:30.030
Tell me,

23:30.063 --> 23:31.297
have you ever shot anybody?

23:35.669 --> 23:37.070
SHORE: Thank you.
MAN: Uh-hmm.

23:40.073 --> 23:41.074
I thought that went well.

23:41.107 --> 23:43.143
What are your thoughts?

23:43.176 --> 23:45.178
(grunting)

23:48.381 --> 23:50.951
SHORE: I need help.
(grunting)

23:50.984 --> 23:53.086
MARSHALL: Get off me!

23:53.119 --> 23:54.087
MAN: Take it easy.

23:54.120 --> 23:55.488
Get off me!
MAN: Easy.

23:55.522 --> 23:56.723
Don't get off him.

23:58.759 --> 24:00.200
Marshall, I won't stay
in the room with you

24:00.233 --> 24:01.434
if you're gonna beat me up.

24:02.969 --> 24:04.938
Can we have a conversation
without you beating me up?

24:04.971 --> 24:05.906
Yes.

24:07.440 --> 24:10.176
I need you to promise.

24:10.210 --> 24:11.277
I promise.

24:12.979 --> 24:14.047
Let him up.

24:14.080 --> 24:14.848
Are you sure?

24:14.881 --> 24:16.783
My clients hit me all the time.

24:16.817 --> 24:18.719
Let him up.
Let's go.

24:22.656 --> 24:25.391
SHORE: Thank you. Please, go.

24:25.425 --> 24:26.693
It's all right.

24:30.296 --> 24:32.165
Marshall,
at the very beginning of this,

24:32.198 --> 24:33.967
I asked you to trust me,
did I not?

24:34.000 --> 24:36.069
No!

24:36.102 --> 24:37.003
I didn't?

24:39.272 --> 24:40.841
I meant to. I'm sorry.

24:40.874 --> 24:42.976
You're supposed
to be my lawyer.

24:43.009 --> 24:44.444
You're supposed to do
everything you can.

24:44.477 --> 24:45.612
You're supposed to care!

24:51.752 --> 24:53.053
I am your lawyer.

24:56.156 --> 24:57.323
Trust that.

25:03.203 --> 25:05.639
(siren wailing)

25:06.873 --> 25:08.575
In open court?

25:08.609 --> 25:10.310
It's not funny, Jamie.

25:10.343 --> 25:11.645
Look,

25:11.678 --> 25:13.547
these things,

25:13.580 --> 25:15.248
sometimes, they happen.

25:15.281 --> 25:17.150
It happened twice.

25:19.352 --> 25:20.386
Jamie,

25:21.387 --> 25:22.723
could you excuse us, please?

25:32.533 --> 25:33.867
I want you to close.

25:35.001 --> 25:36.837
Excuse me?
Good or bad,

25:36.870 --> 25:39.740
you have the relationship
with the jury here.

25:39.773 --> 25:41.808
It would throw them
if I suddenly got up.

25:43.243 --> 25:45.178
Do you think you're capable
of standing up

25:45.211 --> 25:46.980
and behaving
like a professional?

25:51.117 --> 25:51.985
Yes.

25:55.021 --> 25:57.490
Thank you.

25:57.524 --> 25:58.892
I'm not doing this for you.

26:01.067 --> 26:03.704
I just believe
it's best for the client

26:03.737 --> 26:06.006
if you dig yourself
out of your own hole.

26:06.039 --> 26:08.975
(music playing)

26:22.055 --> 26:23.189
Don't want her close.

26:23.223 --> 26:24.490
Male puppet.

26:24.525 --> 26:25.325
FRUTT: Mr. Tang,

26:25.358 --> 26:27.460
the jury might be confused

26:27.493 --> 26:28.361
if I got up.

26:28.394 --> 26:29.963
She think case funny.

26:29.996 --> 26:30.731
Up creek.

26:30.764 --> 26:31.698
No ping-pong.

26:35.769 --> 26:38.071
I think he means "paddle."

26:40.173 --> 26:41.207
OKUBO: Ms. Wilson,

26:41.241 --> 26:42.242
are you ready?

26:48.915 --> 26:49.916
Male puppet.

26:52.152 --> 26:55.021
When I began law school,

26:55.055 --> 26:56.723
I was convinced
that American juries

26:56.757 --> 26:58.825
would be negatively predisposed

26:58.859 --> 27:01.535
against my British accent,

27:01.568 --> 27:04.204
so I learned to speak American,

27:04.237 --> 27:05.906
the thinking being

27:05.939 --> 27:08.408
that the better
the jurors related to me,

27:08.441 --> 27:10.611
the better my chances
of persuasion.

27:10.644 --> 27:11.444
And let's face it.

27:11.477 --> 27:12.746
Americans are pretty arrogant

27:12.779 --> 27:14.414
about the English language.

27:14.447 --> 27:15.949
They expect
the rest of the world

27:15.982 --> 27:18.318
not only to learn it,

27:18.351 --> 27:20.521
but to speak it
the way they do.

27:20.554 --> 27:23.323
Tang Jingyu doesn't speak
English very well.

27:25.859 --> 27:28.428
He even sounds a little funny.

27:28.461 --> 27:29.863
Combine his accent

27:29.896 --> 27:32.265
with the fact that he got blown
off a toilet.

27:34.400 --> 27:35.468
I laughed.

27:36.837 --> 27:38.338
Maybe some of you did, as well.

27:39.973 --> 27:42.008
But what's not so damn funny

27:43.109 --> 27:45.145
is that this man was hurt.

27:45.178 --> 27:47.681
He suffered third-degree burns.

27:47.714 --> 27:50.617
He is scarred for life.

27:50.651 --> 27:51.818
Is he partly to blame?

27:51.852 --> 27:54.521
Absolutely, he should not
have been smoking.

27:54.555 --> 27:55.856
But the question is

27:55.889 --> 27:58.525
"Who is to blame more?"

27:58.559 --> 28:01.535
Is it foreseeable
that people smoke in lavatories?

28:01.568 --> 28:02.468
Of course it is.

28:02.503 --> 28:04.170
People smoke in bathrooms

28:04.204 --> 28:06.006
in high schools,

28:06.039 --> 28:07.207
on airplanes,

28:07.240 --> 28:10.210
in gas stations.

28:10.243 --> 28:12.746
And knowing
that this sometimes goes on,

28:12.779 --> 28:15.949
you do not put flammables

28:15.982 --> 28:17.584
in a toilet bowl.

28:19.520 --> 28:20.587
To do so,

28:20.621 --> 28:23.023
that is negligence.

28:24.257 --> 28:26.660
And as amusing as it all may be,

28:26.693 --> 28:29.495
as a result of this negligence,

28:30.964 --> 28:33.767
an innocent man was injured.

28:33.800 --> 28:35.836
He waited five years
to get to trial,

28:37.771 --> 28:39.673
only to be laughed at
by his own lawyer.

28:43.309 --> 28:44.845
This man suffered real pain,

28:48.381 --> 28:49.750
and he deserves better.

29:04.237 --> 29:06.840
He knew the room
had just been painted.

29:06.873 --> 29:09.710
He was told not to go in.

29:09.743 --> 29:12.312
The "No smoking" signs
were posted.

29:12.345 --> 29:14.981
The room had fumes and still,

29:16.149 --> 29:18.384
he lights a match.

29:19.520 --> 29:21.054
He caused this.

29:21.087 --> 29:23.890
He blew up my client's bathroom

29:23.924 --> 29:26.292
and he's suing.

29:26.326 --> 29:27.493
Come on.

29:27.528 --> 29:29.630
That may not technically
be a legal argument

29:29.663 --> 29:31.331
but let me say it again,

29:31.364 --> 29:34.000
this was his negligence,
not ours,

29:35.301 --> 29:36.703
and you know that.

29:45.311 --> 29:47.948
The question
is a simple one really,

29:50.016 --> 29:51.384
is it foreseeable

29:51.417 --> 29:53.887
that someone might light a match

29:53.920 --> 29:56.456
and drop it in a toilet bowl?

29:57.423 --> 30:00.133
If no, find for the defendant.

30:00.166 --> 30:02.368
If yes, find for the plaintiff.

30:12.779 --> 30:14.147
(elevator bell dings)

30:23.790 --> 30:25.826
I don't know
whether you saved yourself,

30:28.995 --> 30:30.897
but that was a good closing,
Tara.

30:30.931 --> 30:32.966
It was simple and persuasive.

30:34.034 --> 30:35.569
You did a very good job.

30:38.271 --> 30:39.239
Thank you.

30:45.846 --> 30:47.047
Can we talk?

30:51.384 --> 30:54.287
You heard Andrea Mills'
testimony.

30:54.320 --> 30:56.857
There was a dispute over price.

30:56.890 --> 30:58.859
The defendant pulled his gun

31:00.093 --> 31:01.535
and he fired.

31:01.568 --> 31:04.437
You can't claim self-defense,
ladies and gentlemen,

31:04.470 --> 31:06.306
if you cause somebody

31:06.339 --> 31:07.908
to reach for a gun

31:07.941 --> 31:10.210
only so you can then blast him,

31:10.243 --> 31:12.713
that's ridiculous.

31:12.746 --> 31:14.414
Now, to be honest,

31:14.447 --> 31:16.950
I don't know what the hell
defense counsel is up to

31:16.983 --> 31:18.151
in this trial.

31:18.184 --> 31:20.521
I suspect all that nonsense
was motivated

31:20.554 --> 31:22.122
by the fact that Mr. Shore

31:22.155 --> 31:23.757
knew he had no case.

31:23.790 --> 31:26.760
The defendant pulled a gun

31:26.793 --> 31:28.128
in front of an eyewitness

31:28.161 --> 31:29.696
and shot somebody.

31:29.730 --> 31:30.997
What could his lawyer

31:31.031 --> 31:32.899
really say or do?

31:32.933 --> 31:35.268
So Mr. Shore tried
to deflect attention

31:35.301 --> 31:36.870
onto himself,

31:36.903 --> 31:39.706
but this isn't about
a lawyer's antics.

31:39.740 --> 31:41.708
We're not in this room

31:41.742 --> 31:44.210
to enjoy defense
counsel's sideshow.

31:44.244 --> 31:46.913
We are here
because his client

31:46.947 --> 31:48.649
committed a murder.

31:48.682 --> 31:50.183
A man is dead.

32:04.270 --> 32:05.772
At the beginning,

32:05.806 --> 32:07.040
you heard me mention

32:07.073 --> 32:09.142
that I was assigned this case.

32:09.175 --> 32:11.311
We have this pro bono program

32:11.344 --> 32:14.280
because somebody has to be here
for the guy.

32:14.314 --> 32:16.349
See, that's where
our judicial system

32:16.382 --> 32:17.651
actually exceeds real life.

32:17.684 --> 32:18.885
In here,

32:18.919 --> 32:20.921
somebody's got
to be there for the guy.

32:20.954 --> 32:22.956
In life,

32:22.989 --> 32:25.425
Marshall Bagnelle
never met his father.

32:25.458 --> 32:26.893
His mother worked full-time,

32:26.927 --> 32:28.795
leaving him home alone all day.

32:28.829 --> 32:31.397
He got involved early in drugs.

32:31.431 --> 32:32.432
There was nobody there

32:32.465 --> 32:33.767
to get him in treatment.

32:33.800 --> 32:35.902
His parents, his teachers,

32:35.936 --> 32:38.138
school principals,
probation officers,

32:38.171 --> 32:40.340
people vested
with the responsibility

32:40.373 --> 32:42.142
of caring for him a little,

32:42.175 --> 32:44.545
they didn't.

32:44.578 --> 32:46.580
And he became a drug addict.

32:46.613 --> 32:47.914
Now, I'm not gonna stand here

32:47.948 --> 32:49.082
and ask you to care for him.

32:49.115 --> 32:50.283
God forbid.

32:50.316 --> 32:52.152
But what I will ask

32:52.185 --> 32:53.720
is for you to recognize

32:53.754 --> 32:55.522
that life hasn't been very fair

32:55.556 --> 32:56.957
to Marshall Bagnelle.

32:56.990 --> 32:58.324
The irony is,

32:58.358 --> 33:00.166
by pulling that trigger
three times,

33:00.200 --> 33:02.235
he gets thrown into a system

33:02.268 --> 33:05.038
that's required
to treat him fairly.

33:05.071 --> 33:06.406
He gets a right

33:06.439 --> 33:08.208
to a fair trial,

33:08.241 --> 33:11.211
and if you afford him
that right,

33:11.244 --> 33:13.379
he must necessarily

33:13.413 --> 33:15.215
be found not guilty.

33:16.683 --> 33:18.218
The supposed eyewitness

33:18.251 --> 33:20.386
admitted she was watching
television,

33:20.420 --> 33:21.287
her own words.

33:21.321 --> 33:22.956
She wasn't looking

33:22.989 --> 33:23.790
at the men

33:23.824 --> 33:24.558
at the time

33:24.591 --> 33:26.459
my client drew his weapon.

33:26.492 --> 33:27.761
She told you that.

33:27.794 --> 33:30.697
She did not see.

33:30.731 --> 33:32.265
Now, what she did see

33:32.298 --> 33:34.000
supports precisely

33:34.034 --> 33:35.769
what Marshall told you.

33:35.802 --> 33:38.605
The victim was going
for his gun.

33:38.639 --> 33:39.706
At that point,

33:39.740 --> 33:42.142
my client could only shoot

33:42.175 --> 33:43.644
or be shot,

33:43.677 --> 33:45.612
that's self-defense.

33:45.646 --> 33:48.582
That's classic self-defense.

33:48.615 --> 33:50.116
And think about it,

33:50.150 --> 33:53.086
if Marshall Bagnelle
wasn't acting in self-defense,

33:53.119 --> 33:55.956
why did he not shoot
Andrea Mills?

33:56.657 --> 33:58.224
Why did he leave behind

33:58.258 --> 33:59.960
this eyewitness?

33:59.993 --> 34:01.334
Perhaps because

34:01.367 --> 34:03.403
she wasn't about

34:03.436 --> 34:05.005
to shoot him.

34:06.372 --> 34:08.574
Of course, you could choose
to ignore all this,

34:08.609 --> 34:10.010
simply because you don't care,

34:10.043 --> 34:11.645
not only about
Marshall Bagnelle,

34:11.678 --> 34:13.079
but also about the law

34:13.112 --> 34:15.014
you swore to uphold,

34:15.047 --> 34:18.018
swore to because what we do
pretend to care about

34:18.051 --> 34:21.021
is the integrity of this system.

34:21.054 --> 34:23.456
We do believe
in that cherished notion

34:23.489 --> 34:24.725
of the fair trial.

34:24.757 --> 34:26.527
We're fiercely loyal

34:26.560 --> 34:28.829
to the ideal that a prosecution

34:28.862 --> 34:30.697
must satisfy
its burden of proof.

34:30.731 --> 34:32.232
They haven't done that here.

34:34.199 --> 34:35.969
As dearly as we'd all love

34:36.002 --> 34:37.638
to send Mr. Bagnelle to prison,

34:37.670 --> 34:39.606
we cannot know for a fact

34:39.639 --> 34:40.674
that the victim,

34:40.706 --> 34:41.775
a drug dealer,

34:41.808 --> 34:44.043
rumored to have killed
somebody before,

34:44.077 --> 34:45.712
didn't draw his gun

34:45.746 --> 34:47.313
to shoot first.

34:47.347 --> 34:48.782
We cannot know

34:48.815 --> 34:50.583
beyond all reasonable doubt

34:50.617 --> 34:52.085
that Marshall Bagnelle

34:52.118 --> 34:54.888
didn't fear for his life.

34:57.658 --> 35:00.333
And if he did reasonably

35:00.366 --> 35:02.202
fear for his life.

35:03.403 --> 35:05.672
If you believe it's possible

35:06.873 --> 35:09.510
that he feared for his life

35:11.578 --> 35:13.647
you must find him not guilty.

35:17.751 --> 35:19.052
Unless, of course,

35:21.922 --> 35:23.456
you don't care.

35:45.912 --> 35:47.914
Sixty-three thousand?

35:47.948 --> 35:49.415
We could get more

35:49.449 --> 35:51.818
but we could get nothing.

35:51.852 --> 35:53.253
I think it's a decent offer.

35:53.286 --> 35:54.788
Clearly, you were hurt

35:54.821 --> 35:56.122
but just as clearly

35:56.156 --> 35:58.224
there was contributory
negligence.

36:00.300 --> 36:02.202
What think?

36:02.235 --> 36:03.403
I think we should take it.

36:05.539 --> 36:06.306
What think?

36:08.775 --> 36:10.744
I believe that we should accept,

36:10.777 --> 36:11.612
as well.

36:14.781 --> 36:16.617
Okay.

36:16.650 --> 36:18.018
FRUTT: Okay.

36:18.051 --> 36:19.419
I'm going to accept, then.

36:21.187 --> 36:22.889
Okay.

36:22.923 --> 36:25.425
FRUTT: This is a good result,
Mr. Tang.

36:27.027 --> 36:27.994
Okay.

36:38.772 --> 36:41.675
Thank you for closing.

36:44.745 --> 36:47.247
Good closing.

36:47.280 --> 36:50.216
(music playing)

36:51.417 --> 36:52.653
Mr. Tang,

36:54.688 --> 36:56.523
I owe you a sincere...

36:57.791 --> 36:59.259
apology.

36:59.292 --> 37:00.060
Give already.

37:00.093 --> 37:02.235
Thank you.

37:02.268 --> 37:04.838
Appreciate closing.

37:12.746 --> 37:14.714
People laugh at me always.

37:16.015 --> 37:18.184
One reason I angry.

37:20.721 --> 37:23.524
Apologize for anger.

37:25.091 --> 37:27.293
You don't need to apologize
for anything.

37:32.398 --> 37:35.101
Not male puppet.

37:41.107 --> 37:42.042
Thank you.

37:50.083 --> 37:51.852
TAMARA: How long
do they usually take?

37:54.154 --> 37:55.455
SHORE: There's really
no telling.

37:55.488 --> 37:58.224
The judge will probably
keep us here until 6:00.

38:01.735 --> 38:03.269
Look, I'm sorry
I jumped you.

38:04.805 --> 38:07.307
I see now you, uh,

38:07.340 --> 38:09.643
kind of had a strategy.

38:09.676 --> 38:11.612
Why didn't you just tell us
what it was?

38:12.746 --> 38:14.280
Takes the fun out of it.

38:17.350 --> 38:19.786
I suppose I should thank you
and all.

38:19.820 --> 38:21.321
Well, I'd prefer money.

38:24.024 --> 38:25.592
You're a big fraud,
you know that?

38:27.227 --> 38:28.895
You do care about my son.

38:30.564 --> 38:31.732
You're not fooling me.

38:37.671 --> 38:38.805
Jury's back.

38:40.206 --> 38:43.143
(music playing)

39:03.036 --> 39:05.271
What does it mean
that it's so fast?

39:05.305 --> 39:07.307
It's usually a good sign
when you win,

39:07.340 --> 39:08.875
but a bad one when you lose.

39:12.178 --> 39:13.647
We'll know in a second,
Marshall.

39:13.680 --> 39:14.881
Hang in there.

39:23.757 --> 39:24.991
Members of the jury,

39:25.025 --> 39:27.293
have you reached a verdict?

39:27.327 --> 39:28.695
We have, Your Honor.

39:28.729 --> 39:30.230
ROBBINS: The defendant
will please rise.

39:33.499 --> 39:34.735
What say you?

39:34.768 --> 39:36.503
In the matter
of the Commonwealth

39:36.537 --> 39:38.271
vs. Marshall Bagnelle,

39:38.304 --> 39:41.041
on the charge of murder
in the first degree,

39:41.074 --> 39:42.408
we find the defendant,

39:42.442 --> 39:43.977
Marshall Bagnelle,

39:44.010 --> 39:45.378
not guilty.

39:47.213 --> 39:48.515
In the matter
of the Commonwealth

39:48.549 --> 39:50.116
vs. Marshall Bagnelle,

39:50.150 --> 39:52.819
on the charge of murder
in the second degree,

39:52.853 --> 39:53.987
we find the defendant,

39:54.020 --> 39:55.488
Marshall Bagnelle,

39:57.791 --> 40:00.333
guilty.

40:00.366 --> 40:01.902
ROBBINS: Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

40:01.935 --> 40:02.969
you are dismissed

40:03.003 --> 40:05.305
with the thanks of this court.

40:05.338 --> 40:07.941
Security, take the defendant
into custody.

40:07.974 --> 40:09.342
We are adjourned.

40:09.375 --> 40:10.443
(gavel bangs)

40:13.146 --> 40:14.981
We'll explore grounds
for appeal, Marshall.

40:16.416 --> 40:18.685
Marshall, look at me.

40:18.719 --> 40:20.253
There's still some things
we can do.

40:20.286 --> 40:21.988
We'll explore all grounds
for appeal.

40:25.491 --> 40:27.493
Marshall,
I'll let you know, okay?

40:29.329 --> 40:31.464
Marshall,

40:31.497 --> 40:32.966
I'll come visit you tomorrow.

40:39.105 --> 40:42.042
(music playing)

40:59.459 --> 41:02.402
(music playing)

41:25.826 --> 41:26.793
WOMAN: You stinker!

41:26.927 --> 41:29.863
(music playing)
