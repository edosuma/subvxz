When Calls The Heart....

00:02.544 --> 00:04.839
Why is Jake Garrison so set
on dragging you back in?

00:04.839 --> 00:06.005
He's planning a robbery.

00:06.005 --> 00:07.341
He killed
a good friend of mine,

00:07.341 --> 00:08.968
left behind a widow and
an 8-year-old daughter.

00:08.968 --> 00:10.051
I don't have to listen to you!

00:10.051 --> 00:11.052
You need to do as you're told.

00:11.052 --> 00:12.137
You're not my father!

00:12.137 --> 00:14.640
You said that you would be
someone to lean on.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.016
I have to think about it.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.059

[Elizabeth writes]
For the years Hope Valley

00:19.895 --> 00:20.980
has been my home,

00:20.980 --> 00:22.690
it has become much more
than that.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.316
It's my inspiration.

00:24.316 --> 00:25.526
Finally,

00:25.526 --> 00:27.277
I've found the heart
of the story I want to share

00:27.277 --> 00:29.530
about this special place.

00:29.530 --> 00:33.116
It's about the spirit of love
and community here,

00:33.116 --> 00:35.035
how no one is judged
by the past,

00:35.035 --> 00:36.996
how redemption is possible,

00:36.996 --> 00:39.540
even when it seems impossible.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.375
I have the beginning
and the middle...

00:41.375 --> 00:45.504
I just wish I knew the ending.

00:47.506 --> 00:49.591
So, do you have an idea
for your first story?

00:49.591 --> 00:50.843
I think I do.

00:50.843 --> 00:52.135
Oh, I wish I could write.

00:52.135 --> 00:54.095
You're so talented.

00:54.095 --> 00:55.096
You have to say that
because you're my friend.

00:55.096 --> 00:57.098
Because you're
my talented friend.

00:57.098 --> 00:58.099
And your nosy friend.

00:58.099 --> 01:00.227
So... you and Frank?

01:00.227 --> 01:01.520
[sighs] Me and Frank.

01:01.520 --> 01:02.396
Well?

01:02.396 --> 01:04.105
Well, Frank is
a wonderful pastor,

01:04.105 --> 01:05.774
and I'm happy the town
wants him to stay.

01:05.774 --> 01:06.901
But you're worried.

01:07.902 --> 01:09.110
I don't know if I want to
get involved with someone

01:09.110 --> 01:10.111
who has secrets.

01:10.111 --> 01:11.864
Had secrets.

01:11.864 --> 01:13.114
Fair enough.

01:13.114 --> 01:14.533
What are you
talking about?

01:14.533 --> 01:16.451
Grown-up stuff,
nothing interesting.

01:16.451 --> 01:17.786
Cody, how come you're not
dressed for school?

01:17.786 --> 01:19.120
I'm hungry.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.873
Get dressed,
and we'll talk about breakfast.

01:20.873 --> 01:22.374
I need you to
pick out my shirt.

01:22.374 --> 01:23.333
Cody, I think
you're old enough

01:23.333 --> 01:24.543
to pick out
your own clothes.

01:24.543 --> 01:25.586
I can help you.

01:25.586 --> 01:28.005
I need you to do it.

01:28.005 --> 01:29.506
[giggles]

01:29.506 --> 01:30.298
[sighs]

01:30.298 --> 01:31.884
I'll be right back.

01:31.884 --> 01:33.552
Let's go, young man.

01:33.552 --> 01:34.511
[chuckling]

01:42.895 --> 01:44.145
You're
headed out early.

01:44.145 --> 01:45.188
I got a long ride
ahead of me.

01:45.188 --> 01:46.774
I want to let
Carl Benson's widow know

01:46.774 --> 01:48.149
we got a lead on Garrison.

01:48.149 --> 01:50.110
Headquarters sent out
a few extra patrols.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.737
Nothing yet.

01:51.737 --> 01:53.072
No sign of Jesse, either.

01:53.072 --> 01:54.031
Garrison's out there, Jack.

01:54.031 --> 01:55.156
He needs Frank.

01:55.156 --> 01:56.157
He doesn't give up easily.

01:56.157 --> 01:57.785
Neither do we.

01:57.785 --> 01:58.744
[horse whinnies]

01:58.744 --> 01:59.745
H'yah!

01:59.745 --> 02:00.746
H'yah...

02:05.166 --> 02:07.335
[♪♪♪]

02:29.942 --> 02:31.652
I have an announcement.

02:31.652 --> 02:32.527
This week,

02:32.527 --> 02:35.114
we'll be having
a spelling contest.

02:35.114 --> 02:37.783
You mean like a spelling bee?

02:37.783 --> 02:39.409
Well, Robert, it's better
than a spelling bee,

02:39.409 --> 02:40.702
because for this contest,

02:40.702 --> 02:42.871
you won't be competing
against each other.

02:42.871 --> 02:45.206
You'll be competing against
yourselves.

02:45.206 --> 02:46.834
What does that mean?

02:46.834 --> 02:48.251
Well, it means

02:48.251 --> 02:49.962
that everyone who learns
all of the words on the board

02:49.962 --> 02:51.130
and gets 100% on the test

02:51.130 --> 02:53.924
will receive...

02:53.924 --> 02:56.135
one of these...

02:56.135 --> 02:57.385
with your name on it.

02:57.385 --> 03:00.014
So, make sure you get someone
to help you study after school.

03:00.014 --> 03:01.682
All right, you may go to recess.

03:01.682 --> 03:04.143
I'm going to get my mom
to help me study.

03:04.143 --> 03:05.769
I'm going to get
Miss Abigail to help me.

03:05.769 --> 03:06.895
She's not your mom.

03:06.895 --> 03:08.147
So what?
She can still help.

03:08.147 --> 03:09.230
It's not the same.

03:09.230 --> 03:10.315
Sure it is.

03:10.315 --> 03:11.942
You're not her real family.

03:11.942 --> 03:16.697
Miss Abigail doesn't love you
the way my mom loves me.

03:22.786 --> 03:25.122
Miss Thatcher.

03:25.122 --> 03:26.790
Mr. Barrett,
what brings you here?

03:26.790 --> 03:27.958
I'm looking for
Constable Thornton,

03:27.958 --> 03:28.834
you know where he is?

03:28.834 --> 03:30.544
I believe he's on patrol. What's
wrong?

03:30.544 --> 03:33.172
There's been an accident
at the mill.

03:33.172 --> 03:34.923
It's Mr. Coulter.

03:42.263 --> 03:44.265
I did everything
you told me.

03:44.265 --> 03:47.310
I guess it just
didn't work out.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.270
Maybe I sent the wrong man.

03:49.270 --> 03:50.522
Everyone
in the valley

03:50.522 --> 03:52.440
saw that wanted poster.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.275
Still, they wouldn't
run him out of town.

03:54.275 --> 03:56.111
What are we
gonna do now?

03:56.111 --> 03:57.404
If we can't get Matt,

03:57.404 --> 03:59.364
seems to me
we might as well move on.

03:59.364 --> 04:01.700
All go
our separate ways.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.077
Say, Lucky,

04:03.077 --> 04:05.286
why don't you show Jesse here
what we do to somebody

04:05.286 --> 04:07.164
who decides to leave
before I say so?

04:11.085 --> 04:12.711
You're not going anywhere.

04:12.711 --> 04:13.962
You understand?

04:19.551 --> 04:21.595
[wincing]

04:23.263 --> 04:24.305
Now, I stopped the bleeding,

04:24.305 --> 04:25.849
but you are going to
need stitches.

04:26.808 --> 04:30.311
Well, what I need is
to get back to work.

04:30.311 --> 04:31.312
You can't stand
on that foot,

04:31.312 --> 04:32.355
much less work.

04:32.355 --> 04:34.066
Well, I can
if you stitch it up.

04:34.066 --> 04:37.152
To be honest, Lee,
this is more than I can handle,

04:37.152 --> 04:38.361
but if I wire Dr. Burns now,

04:38.361 --> 04:40.321
he can probably get here
before the end of the day.

04:40.321 --> 04:41.782
Well, can I at least go home?

04:41.782 --> 04:43.200
It's best you stay
here in town

04:43.200 --> 04:44.993
until the doctor arrives, okay?

04:44.993 --> 04:46.703
Well, I guess that's it, Wade,

04:46.703 --> 04:48.329
you're in charge
until I get back.

04:48.329 --> 04:50.582
Please try and
keep things on schedule.

04:50.582 --> 04:51.416
Yes, sir.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.334
We haven't
officially met yet.

04:53.334 --> 04:54.711
I'm Mr. Coulter's
new foreman. Wade Barrett.

04:54.711 --> 04:55.587
Hi.

04:55.587 --> 04:56.922
Lee! I came
as soon as I heard.

04:56.922 --> 04:58.048
[gasps]

04:58.048 --> 04:59.549
What happened?

04:59.549 --> 05:00.717
[wincing] Ah, ah, ah!

05:01.676 --> 05:04.054
The Number two
winch cable--

05:04.054 --> 05:06.807
just, this cable snapped
and whipped across my foot,

05:06.807 --> 05:07.808
but it'll be fine.

05:07.808 --> 05:08.683
[gasping]

05:08.683 --> 05:09.643
I don't want you to
worry about a thing.

05:09.643 --> 05:10.644
I am not going to
leave your side

05:10.644 --> 05:12.479
until you are back
on your...

05:14.064 --> 05:15.941
foot again.

05:15.941 --> 05:17.025
I'll be fine, Rosemary.

05:17.025 --> 05:17.985
You don't need to stay.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.611
I want to stay.

05:19.611 --> 05:21.029
Well, thank you,
I appreciate that,

05:21.029 --> 05:22.363
but I think I just need to rest.

05:22.363 --> 05:23.740
Of course you do.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.408
Rest is the best thing for you
until the doctor arrives.

05:25.408 --> 05:26.743
Here, let me fluff your pillow.

05:27.786 --> 05:28.787
Whoa...

05:28.787 --> 05:29.746
-There.
-Ow.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.168
Oh, one more.

05:36.586 --> 05:37.963
Oh! Oh, okay.
Ow, ow, ow, careful.

05:50.475 --> 05:53.103
You just going to sit there
and watch me sleep?

05:53.103 --> 05:55.480
Nothing is going to happen
to you while I'm here.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.233
I'll be as quiet as a mouse.

05:58.233 --> 05:59.193
Okay.

06:00.319 --> 06:02.279
Just... just sleep.

06:09.786 --> 06:10.871
Shh.

06:11.955 --> 06:13.040
Yeah, okay, okay.

06:15.792 --> 06:16.835
H'yah!

06:29.472 --> 06:30.807
Excuse me, Miss.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.642
Are you by chance Lucy Benson?

06:32.642 --> 06:33.643
I am.

06:33.643 --> 06:36.395
My name's Bill Avery.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.941
I was a good friend
of your father's.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.735
Is your mother around?

06:41.735 --> 06:45.864
Oh, um... my mother passed...

06:45.864 --> 06:48.449
just a few years after
my father was killed.

06:48.449 --> 06:49.659
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

06:50.994 --> 06:53.454
Um, well, it looks like
you've ridden a long way.

06:53.454 --> 06:55.414
Would you like to come in
for some tea, Mr. Avery?

06:55.414 --> 06:57.834
That's mighty nice of you,
thank you.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.460
Sure.

07:05.466 --> 07:06.676
You here to pick up Cody?

07:07.969 --> 07:10.471
He likes it when
I walk him home from school.

07:10.471 --> 07:12.766
I can't say I blame him.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.268
I just wish I didn't have to run
back to the cafe

07:14.268 --> 07:15.310
for the dinner rush.

07:15.310 --> 07:17.478
You're working
too hard.

07:17.478 --> 07:19.480
You need to have
some fun.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.358
I have fun.

07:22.483 --> 07:24.111
You ever play darts?

07:24.111 --> 07:25.528
A long time ago.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.655
Well, how about you and I see
how much you remember

07:27.655 --> 07:29.116
tonight at the saloon?

07:29.116 --> 07:32.953
Well, I'd like that, but...

07:35.372 --> 07:38.583
My past is still
bothering you, isn't it?

07:38.583 --> 07:41.002
Who I was and who I am now.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.965
I'd be lying
if I said it didn't.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.507
[school bell rings]

07:46.507 --> 07:47.592
You don't feel comfortable

07:47.592 --> 07:49.303
spending time
with someone like me?

07:50.387 --> 07:51.763
It's not that--

07:51.763 --> 07:52.973
Abigail,

07:52.973 --> 07:54.391
I don't want to push you
into doing something

07:54.391 --> 07:56.101
you don't want to do.

07:57.518 --> 07:59.229
You're not.

07:59.229 --> 08:00.272
Darts it is.

08:01.522 --> 08:03.608
I love darts!
When are we going to play?

08:03.608 --> 08:06.527
Cody, you and I will
play darts another time.

08:06.527 --> 08:07.695
[Cody] But it's spaghetti
and meatball night!

08:07.695 --> 08:10.531
And Miss Thatcher said
there's a spelling contest,

08:10.531 --> 08:13.034
and I need you to
help me learn the words!

08:13.034 --> 08:14.744
[Elizabeth] I'll help you
learn the words, Cody,

08:14.744 --> 08:17.331
and I'll make you
an extra big bowl of spaghetti.

08:17.331 --> 08:18.999
You and Frank go have
a great time,

08:18.999 --> 08:20.750
and we'll have
a great time, too.

08:21.542 --> 08:23.670
Come on, Cody.

08:27.466 --> 08:28.549
Here you are.

08:28.549 --> 08:29.550
Thank you.

08:29.550 --> 08:30.885
Careful, it's hot.

08:31.803 --> 08:33.430
You have your mother's smile.

08:33.430 --> 08:35.556
She was, um...

08:35.556 --> 08:38.852
she was never the same
after my father was gone.

08:38.852 --> 08:42.439
Seeing my father shot
during the bank robbery,

08:42.439 --> 08:44.024
it was just too much for her.

08:44.024 --> 08:47.568
The reason I'm here
is because...

08:47.568 --> 08:49.612
we were never able
to find a suspect

08:49.612 --> 08:51.990
for your mother to identify.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.450
Until now.

08:54.575 --> 08:58.413
You found the man
who killed my father?

08:58.413 --> 08:59.622
I think so.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.082
His name is Jake Garrison.

09:01.082 --> 09:02.959
I believe he's hiding out
in the high country,

09:02.959 --> 09:05.379
somewhere east of Hope Valley.

09:05.379 --> 09:06.587
But, Mr. Avery,

09:06.587 --> 09:09.132
I mean, without a witness
like my mother, you can't--

09:09.132 --> 09:10.133
There's no--

09:10.133 --> 09:12.177
Lucy...

09:12.177 --> 09:13.678
I promise you,

09:13.678 --> 09:14.888
I will personally see to it

09:14.888 --> 09:17.557
that Jake Garrison
pays for his crimes,

09:17.557 --> 09:19.393
one way or another.

09:19.393 --> 09:22.479
Thank you so much.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.605
[crying]

09:25.606 --> 09:27.692
What about this one?

09:27.692 --> 09:28.609
Are you going on a date
or to a funeral?

09:28.609 --> 09:29.694
This is the one.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.446
Oh, I'm not sure
this is a good idea.

09:31.446 --> 09:32.489
No, trust me.

09:32.489 --> 09:33.490
It's beautiful.

09:33.490 --> 09:34.615
I meant tonight.

09:34.615 --> 09:36.451
Getting all dressed up,
leaving Cody...

09:36.451 --> 09:37.411
Don't worry
about Cody.

09:37.411 --> 09:38.619
He'll be fine.

09:38.619 --> 09:41.664
I know, but is this happening
too quickly?

09:41.664 --> 09:42.957
Look what happened with Bill.

09:42.957 --> 09:45.335
Different men,
different situations.

09:45.335 --> 09:46.627
Well, I'm not so sure.

09:46.627 --> 09:48.046
I thought I knew Bill,

09:48.046 --> 09:49.630
and really, what do
I know about Frank?

09:49.630 --> 09:51.425
That's why you're going
to spend time with him--

09:51.425 --> 09:52.633
to get to know him.

09:52.633 --> 09:55.345
[sighs heavily]

09:55.345 --> 09:57.055
Cody! Cody!

09:57.055 --> 10:00.183
Isn't Miss Abigail's
dress beautiful?

10:00.183 --> 10:01.309
I guess.

10:02.394 --> 10:04.229
Cody, I won't be long,

10:04.229 --> 10:06.523
and you'll have fun
at Miss Thatcher's.

10:06.523 --> 10:07.607
No, I won't.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.649
Sure you will.

10:08.649 --> 10:09.901
We'll study your spelling words,

10:09.901 --> 10:11.652
we'll eat
spaghetti and meatballs,

10:11.652 --> 10:13.363
you can play catch
with Constable Thornton

10:13.363 --> 10:14.739
while I shop for dinner.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.199
Don't you want to practice
your pitching?

10:16.199 --> 10:18.826
I'd rather stay here
with Miss Abigail.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.665
We will study your spelling
words tomorrow, I promise.

10:24.665 --> 10:27.043
And...

10:27.043 --> 10:28.669
I'll bake you a pie for dessert.

10:28.669 --> 10:29.796
Okay?

10:31.172 --> 10:32.299
Okay.

10:44.769 --> 10:46.687
He's not usually like this.

10:46.687 --> 10:48.231
He'll be fine.

10:48.231 --> 10:49.483
[sighs sadly]

10:49.483 --> 10:50.817
Oh... [chuckling]

10:50.817 --> 10:52.693
You and this dress.

10:52.693 --> 10:55.071
So, how is
Mr. Coulter?

10:55.071 --> 10:58.699
Oh, he's going to be better
once the doctor gets here.

10:58.699 --> 11:00.368
Tell me,

11:00.368 --> 11:02.703
you ever think about
re-opening the infirmary?

11:02.703 --> 11:03.788
Well, technically,

11:03.788 --> 11:05.206
the infirmary is still
the property

11:05.206 --> 11:06.707
of the mining company.

11:06.707 --> 11:08.709
Well, I'm sure you could
pull some strings.

11:08.709 --> 11:10.920
A growing town
needs a doctor.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.713
I'll take that
under advisement.

11:12.713 --> 11:14.715
That's not a bad idea.

11:14.715 --> 11:16.384
Let me help you, Miss.

11:17.927 --> 11:18.928
Jack!

11:18.928 --> 11:20.430
Faith?

11:28.729 --> 11:31.608
It is so good to see you.

11:31.608 --> 11:32.859
I was hoping I'd run into you,

11:32.859 --> 11:34.611
but I didn't know
it would be this soon.

11:34.611 --> 11:35.654
What are you doing here?

11:35.654 --> 11:37.614
I live in
Union City now.

11:37.614 --> 11:38.697
I work for Dr. Burns.

11:38.697 --> 11:39.991
He was busy,
so he sent me instead.

11:39.991 --> 11:43.620
Um, this is our mayor,
Henry Gowen.

11:43.620 --> 11:44.787
Nurse Faith Carter.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.914
I take it you two
know each other.

11:46.914 --> 11:48.249
We met in Hamilton,

11:48.249 --> 11:49.750
when I took care of
Jack's brother in the hospital.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.294
A pleasure, Miss Carter.

11:51.294 --> 11:52.337
Mine as well.

11:52.337 --> 11:53.505
Good afternoon.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.217
I shouldn't keep
my patient waiting.

11:57.217 --> 12:00.345
I just need to drop off my bag
and clean up a bit.

12:00.345 --> 12:01.762
Which way is the hotel?

12:01.762 --> 12:03.348
Well, I'll walk you over.

12:03.348 --> 12:04.599
Thanks.

12:05.766 --> 12:07.143
You moved
to Union City?

12:07.143 --> 12:08.186
I did.

12:08.186 --> 12:09.770
I got engaged

12:09.770 --> 12:11.772
to a banker
who lives there.

12:11.772 --> 12:12.773
Oh, that's great.

12:12.773 --> 12:13.774
Congratulations.

12:13.774 --> 12:14.859
[chuckling] Oh, Jack.

12:14.859 --> 12:16.152
You didn't think
I came all this way

12:16.152 --> 12:17.487
just to see you?

12:17.487 --> 12:18.613
No, of course not.

12:18.613 --> 12:20.198
I hope not,

12:20.198 --> 12:22.576
because I was worried
it might look that way,

12:22.576 --> 12:23.702
and I didn't
want you to think...

12:23.702 --> 12:25.370
No, it didn't,
at all.

12:25.370 --> 12:26.538
Good.

12:26.538 --> 12:27.788
What about you?

12:27.788 --> 12:29.790
Did Elizabeth Thatcher
stay in Hamilton?

12:29.790 --> 12:32.793
No. She's right here.

12:32.793 --> 12:34.795
So you're engaged, too?

12:34.795 --> 12:36.548
We're taking our time.

12:36.548 --> 12:37.591
That's smart.

12:37.591 --> 12:38.633
I know there were things

12:38.633 --> 12:39.800
the two of you
needed to work out.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.344
And that is
all behind us.

12:41.344 --> 12:43.012
I'm glad to hear it.

12:43.012 --> 12:45.139
I hope

12:45.139 --> 12:47.475
things aren't awkward
between you and me.

12:47.475 --> 12:49.810
I enjoyed spending time with you
in Hamilton,

12:49.810 --> 12:51.563
and I want us to be friends.

12:51.563 --> 12:52.855
Of course, we're friends.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.941
That means a lot to me.

13:01.531 --> 13:03.824
Look, if there are any
problems with the shipment,

13:03.824 --> 13:04.701
any at all--

13:04.701 --> 13:06.035
I got it handled,
Mr. Coulter.

13:06.035 --> 13:06.827
Don't you worry.

13:06.827 --> 13:07.828
Good.

13:07.828 --> 13:10.831
All Abigail had left
was some tomato soup.

13:10.831 --> 13:13.543
It's not half as good as mine,
but it'll do in a pinch.

13:13.543 --> 13:15.128
I added
a little salt.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.087
I'm not hungry.

13:16.087 --> 13:17.838
Hmm.

13:17.838 --> 13:19.132
[knocks gently]

13:19.132 --> 13:20.592
Hey.

13:20.592 --> 13:21.593
Help has arrived.

13:21.593 --> 13:22.843
This is Faith Carter.

13:22.843 --> 13:24.596
She is a nurse from Union City.

13:24.596 --> 13:26.681
Nurse?

13:26.681 --> 13:27.557
Where's Dr. Burns?

13:27.557 --> 13:29.559
He wasn't available,
so I'm filling in.

13:29.559 --> 13:30.851
I hope you don't mind.

13:30.851 --> 13:32.312
I guess you'll have to do.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.773
I guess I will.

13:34.773 --> 13:37.734
I once played
a nurse on the stage.

13:37.734 --> 13:38.777
What a coincidence.

13:38.777 --> 13:40.612
I once treated
an actress for pink eye.

13:40.612 --> 13:41.862
[laughs]

13:41.862 --> 13:44.865
Well, looks like
you're in capable hands here.

13:44.865 --> 13:45.824
I'll check on you later.

13:45.824 --> 13:47.118
Thanks, Jack.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.871
Nurse Carter,

13:50.871 --> 13:52.873
I'm afraid your patient

13:52.873 --> 13:55.126
hasn't been
very cooperative.

13:55.126 --> 13:55.960
Really?

13:55.960 --> 13:57.878
I can't get him
to eat anything.

13:57.878 --> 13:59.880
I keep telling her,
I'm not hungry.

13:59.880 --> 14:00.881
And I keep telling you,

14:00.881 --> 14:02.676
a healthy diet is key
to a speedy recovery--

14:02.676 --> 14:03.884
Oh.

14:03.884 --> 14:05.303
As I'm sure
you're well aware.

14:05.303 --> 14:06.220
True,

14:06.220 --> 14:07.555
but I'm more concerned
with cleaning

14:07.555 --> 14:08.931
and suturing the wound.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.141
Constable Thornton
has already taken care of that.

14:10.141 --> 14:12.018
Mounties are trained
in first aid.

14:12.018 --> 14:15.021
I know, but it doesn't hurt
to be thorough.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.939
Why don't we just
let her do her job, okay?

14:16.939 --> 14:19.484
Lee, save your strength.

14:19.484 --> 14:20.527
No need to chime in.

14:20.527 --> 14:21.820
[Lee] Mm-hmm...

14:21.820 --> 14:23.070
What's the bell for?

14:23.070 --> 14:24.905
[gasps] Oh!
That was my idea.

14:24.905 --> 14:25.948
It's for emergencies.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.908
In case Lee needs me,
and I'm not right here.

14:27.908 --> 14:30.411
Are you sure you can hear it
all the way down the hall?

14:30.411 --> 14:32.330
It's so small.
It might not be loud enough.

14:32.330 --> 14:33.748
Well, I don't know.

14:33.748 --> 14:35.916
He hasn't used it yet.

14:35.916 --> 14:37.627
Why don't we
test it out?

14:37.627 --> 14:39.754
Just to be
on the safe side, huh?

14:39.754 --> 14:40.880
That is a good idea.

14:40.880 --> 14:41.922
Now, Lee,

14:41.922 --> 14:45.176
when I leave the room,
ring the bell.

14:45.176 --> 14:46.678
Whatever you say.

14:46.678 --> 14:47.887
Okay.

14:50.931 --> 14:52.767
[Rosemary calling]
Whenever you're ready!

14:52.767 --> 14:54.686
Just a minute!

14:57.564 --> 14:58.732
Ha!

14:58.732 --> 15:00.692
Now, let me have a look
at that foot.

15:06.947 --> 15:08.616
Pastor!

15:08.616 --> 15:09.950
[clucking to horse]
H'yah, h'yah...

15:09.950 --> 15:10.951
Yeah, no word from Jesse,

15:10.951 --> 15:12.953
so no need asking again.

15:12.953 --> 15:14.955
Jake Garrison killed
one of my best friends,

15:14.955 --> 15:15.956
and I stood up for you
in this town

15:15.956 --> 15:17.876
when most people
wanted you gone.

15:17.876 --> 15:18.918
So, the way I see it,

15:18.918 --> 15:20.420
I can ask
any question I want.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.962
As long as we keep
the subject to Garrison,

15:21.962 --> 15:23.047
that's fine.

15:23.047 --> 15:24.883
Convince me Jesse
won't bring Garrison into town

15:24.883 --> 15:25.966
to get you back.

15:25.966 --> 15:28.135
Jesse won't come near
this town if he's smart.

15:28.135 --> 15:30.930
Well, he didn't appear to me
to be all that bright.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.520
He's had it harder than most.

15:37.520 --> 15:40.231
He lost both his parents
when he was young.

15:40.231 --> 15:43.902
He kicked around a spell
before Garrison took him on.

15:43.902 --> 15:45.027
He's not a bad kid.

15:45.027 --> 15:47.029
A little girl named Lucy Benson
grew up without a dad

15:47.029 --> 15:48.989
because of Jake Garrison,

15:48.989 --> 15:50.032
so you'll
excuse me, Pastor,

15:50.032 --> 15:51.242
if I don't turn
the other cheek.

15:51.242 --> 15:53.286
He had nothing to do with that.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.329
Like I told you before,
he's not a killer.

15:55.329 --> 15:57.998
Sounds like you got
a soft spot for the kid.

15:57.998 --> 16:01.001
There was a time
when he looked up to me,

16:01.001 --> 16:03.003
for all the wrong reasons.

16:03.003 --> 16:05.381
No, Jesse's old enough
to make his own choices.

16:05.381 --> 16:08.008
I just pray every day
he makes the right ones.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.763
You let me know if you see him.

16:19.979 --> 16:23.691
And I need some iodine,
if you have any.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.151
You're in luck.

16:27.111 --> 16:28.822
That'll be $2.00 even.

16:28.822 --> 16:29.906
Mr. Coulter said

16:29.906 --> 16:30.907
I could put it
on his account.

16:30.907 --> 16:31.991
I hope that's
all right.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.033
I didn't catch
your name.

16:33.033 --> 16:34.577
Faith Carter.

16:36.496 --> 16:37.872
Faith Carter

16:37.872 --> 16:39.248
from Hamilton?

16:39.248 --> 16:42.042
You must be Elizabeth Thatcher.

16:42.042 --> 16:43.711
Nice to finally meet you.

16:43.711 --> 16:45.045
I've heard
so much about you.

16:45.045 --> 16:46.088
You, too.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.926
[sighs awkwardly]

16:49.926 --> 16:52.094
So, what are you
doing in Hope Valley?

16:52.094 --> 16:54.054
I'm looking after
Mr. Coulter.

16:54.054 --> 16:55.807
The doctor was busy,
so he sent me.

16:55.807 --> 16:59.059
And you came all the way
from Hamilton?

16:59.059 --> 17:01.395
No, I work at the hospital
in Union City now.

17:01.395 --> 17:03.063
Oh.

17:03.063 --> 17:04.106
What brought you to Union City?

17:04.106 --> 17:06.985
My fiancé lives there.

17:06.985 --> 17:07.944
He's in banking.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.028
Oh...

17:09.028 --> 17:10.697
Oh!

17:10.697 --> 17:12.365
You have a fiancé.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.950
That's wonderful.
Congratulations.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.159
Thank you.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.661
[chuckling in relief]

17:16.661 --> 17:20.080
Jack has told me so many
wonderful things about you.

17:20.080 --> 17:21.081
I feel like I already know you.

17:21.081 --> 17:22.542
That's very sweet
of you to say.

17:22.542 --> 17:26.086
Um, I'd better get back
to my patient.

17:26.086 --> 17:28.548
I hope we have the chance
to get better acquainted.

17:28.548 --> 17:29.674
I'm sure we will.

17:29.674 --> 17:30.842
Great.

17:32.259 --> 17:33.720
Thank you.

17:33.720 --> 17:34.971
Bye.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.138
Bye.

17:42.102 --> 17:43.187
How's that?

17:43.187 --> 17:44.397
Perfect.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.690
Hello?

17:45.690 --> 17:46.733
Hi!

17:46.733 --> 17:47.901
Hi.

17:47.901 --> 17:50.110
Oh, hope I'm not
interrupting.

17:50.110 --> 17:51.821
No. Jack, you've met
my new neighbor.

17:51.821 --> 17:53.113
Yes, of course.
Wade Barrett.

17:53.113 --> 17:54.448
Hey.

17:54.448 --> 17:55.575
Wade was kind enough
to hang this picture for me.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.661
It was good to see you
again, Constable.

17:58.661 --> 17:59.662
Ma'am.

17:59.662 --> 18:01.622
Thank you.

18:07.670 --> 18:09.129
You know, I could have hung
that picture up for you.

18:09.129 --> 18:11.090
I know you could,

18:11.090 --> 18:14.552
but I mentioned it to Wade,
and he offered.

18:14.552 --> 18:15.386
Where's Cody?

18:15.386 --> 18:17.764
He's outside playing with Rip,

18:17.764 --> 18:19.515
and he's not in a great mood.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.141
He wanted to stay
with Abigail tonight

18:21.141 --> 18:23.143
to practice
his spelling with her.

18:23.143 --> 18:24.478
He really wants to get
that certificate.

18:25.730 --> 18:26.689
Would you mind
setting the table?

18:26.689 --> 18:27.648
Sure.

18:32.152 --> 18:36.699
So, I ran into
Faith Carter today.

18:36.699 --> 18:37.825
Oh, you did?
You met her?

18:37.825 --> 18:39.159
She's very pretty.

18:39.159 --> 18:40.745
Well, she's a very good nurse.

18:40.745 --> 18:42.162
I'm sure she is.

18:42.162 --> 18:43.748
Elizabeth, you know

18:43.748 --> 18:46.166
I had nothing to do with her
coming to Hope Valley, right?

18:46.166 --> 18:49.087
I really want to believe that,

18:49.087 --> 18:52.131
but I think
I might need something

18:52.131 --> 18:55.175
a little more convincing
than just words.

18:55.175 --> 18:57.053
More convincing?

18:57.053 --> 18:58.137
Mm-hmm.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.186
I wonder what
that could be.

19:06.186 --> 19:07.229
[door opens]

19:07.229 --> 19:09.189
[Cody]
Is dinner ready?

19:09.189 --> 19:11.233
[Elizabeth]
Coming right up.

19:11.233 --> 19:14.445
Um, just wash your hands.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.782
[♪♪♪]

19:20.827 --> 19:22.202
Is this how I hold it?

19:22.202 --> 19:23.537
Yeah, very close,
just...

19:23.537 --> 19:27.000
Just... that's it,
two fingers there.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.043
Just feel...
just relax a little.

19:29.043 --> 19:30.128
Just nice and easy.

19:30.128 --> 19:31.211
Okay.

19:31.211 --> 19:32.212
Real smooth. Okay?

19:32.212 --> 19:33.673
-Here we go.
-All right, give it a shot.

19:34.882 --> 19:36.216
[Frank]
Not bad, not bad.

19:36.216 --> 19:37.969
Try again, just...
boom.

19:37.969 --> 19:39.178
Okay.

19:42.222 --> 19:45.893
Wow, that's what I call
beginner's luck.

19:47.478 --> 19:49.897
I never said
I was a beginner.

19:51.231 --> 19:54.861
You didn't even know
how to hold the dart.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.403
I'd forgotten.

19:58.072 --> 19:59.239
Wait a minute,
have I just been taken?

19:59.239 --> 20:01.241
I don't know.

20:01.241 --> 20:02.201
Have you?

20:03.744 --> 20:05.079
it seems I'm not the only one
with some secrets around here.

20:05.079 --> 20:07.623
A little mystery
can be a good thing.

20:08.582 --> 20:10.250
What else
don't I know about you?

20:10.250 --> 20:14.380
Well, you'll have to
stick around and find out.

20:21.679 --> 20:23.347
[♪♪♪]

20:36.527 --> 20:37.653
All right...

20:38.612 --> 20:41.615
That's not how Miss Abigail
makes spaghetti.

20:41.615 --> 20:44.326
Well, it's
Miss Abigail's recipe.

20:44.326 --> 20:45.912
But she doesn't
mix it all together.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.955
But it tastes exactly the same.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.749
I'm not hungry anymore.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.918
Well...

20:51.918 --> 20:53.711
I'm not a doctor,

20:53.711 --> 20:55.379
but I think it's because

20:55.379 --> 20:57.297
you have a case of the giggles
trapped inside you.

20:57.297 --> 20:59.217
-No, I don't.
-Good.

20:59.217 --> 21:03.054
Because whatever you do,
don't smile,

21:03.054 --> 21:04.972
because there's absolutely...

21:04.972 --> 21:06.015
[breathes out]

21:06.015 --> 21:08.226
nothing to smile about.

21:08.226 --> 21:10.728
Nothing to laugh about,

21:10.728 --> 21:12.772
nothing funny.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.690
Nothing at all.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.442
Isn't that
right, Jack?

21:16.442 --> 21:18.318
That's right,
you listen to Miss Thatcher.

21:18.318 --> 21:19.737
There is absolutely...

21:19.737 --> 21:20.780
[breathes out]

21:20.780 --> 21:22.156
nothing to laugh about.

21:22.156 --> 21:26.285
In fact, laughing
is strictly forbidden.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.912
[giggles]

21:27.912 --> 21:29.329
Can I try it?

21:29.329 --> 21:30.623
Mm-hmm.

21:33.918 --> 21:34.961
Yay!

21:34.961 --> 21:36.003
[clapping]

21:36.003 --> 21:37.296
[laughing]

21:38.505 --> 21:40.883
I guess I'm a little hungry
after all.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.012
[howls]

21:45.012 --> 21:46.722
[chuckling]

21:48.808 --> 21:49.892
[laughing]

21:49.892 --> 21:50.977
I don't remember
the last time

21:50.977 --> 21:52.311
I was hustled in darts.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.854
Oh, I hope
you're not mad.

21:53.854 --> 21:56.816
No! Mad?
I'm impressed.

21:56.816 --> 21:57.900
[chuckling]

22:01.988 --> 22:04.115
I had a lot of fun tonight.

22:05.158 --> 22:06.700
Me too.

22:20.673 --> 22:23.383
Good night.

22:23.383 --> 22:25.594
Good night.

22:37.397 --> 22:39.483
You're back late.

22:39.483 --> 22:42.820
I didn't know
I had a curfew.

22:44.404 --> 22:45.865
Business is better
this month.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.825
Well, a growing town is
certainly good for business,

22:47.825 --> 22:49.409
that's for sure.

22:49.409 --> 22:50.410
The question is,

22:50.410 --> 22:51.829
do you know what's good for you?

22:52.872 --> 22:54.748
Bill, if you have
something to say, just say it.

22:54.748 --> 22:56.374
All right.

22:58.252 --> 23:00.713
I'm worried about
you and Frank.

23:00.713 --> 23:03.049
I don't see how that's
any of your business.

23:03.049 --> 23:04.050
Well, maybe it isn't,

23:04.050 --> 23:05.176
but that doesn't mean

23:05.176 --> 23:06.344
I can't be concerned
about your safety.

23:06.344 --> 23:08.012
Frank had a past
that he is not proud of,

23:08.012 --> 23:09.222
so he faced it.

23:09.222 --> 23:10.723
He faced all of us.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.225
Regardless,

23:12.225 --> 23:13.475
there are a lot of dangerous
people looking for this guy.

23:13.475 --> 23:15.393
Well, then he needs us
now more than ever.

23:15.393 --> 23:16.687
[windows smashing,
yelping in fright]

23:26.072 --> 23:27.031
They're gone!

23:35.331 --> 23:36.456
[Gowen]
I expressed my concerns

23:36.456 --> 23:38.458
about the situation
with the pastor,

23:38.458 --> 23:41.879
but everyone wanted to pretend
that it would be all right.

23:41.879 --> 23:43.214
Well...

23:43.214 --> 23:45.007
this is the situation
that we find ourselves in.

23:46.633 --> 23:48.468
What do you suggest
we do, Constable?

23:48.468 --> 23:49.887
[rowdy murmuring]
Yeah! Come on!

23:49.887 --> 23:52.223
Okay, let's not
overreact.

23:52.223 --> 23:53.140
No one's gotten hurt.

23:53.140 --> 23:54.183
Not yet.

23:54.183 --> 23:55.684
Garrison wants me.

23:55.684 --> 23:57.477
I'll find him,

23:57.477 --> 23:58.771
settle this thing
once and for all.

23:58.771 --> 23:59.855
You go out
looking for him,

23:59.855 --> 24:01.148
you're just going to
get yourself killed.

24:01.148 --> 24:03.692
You know he's not going to
take no for an answer.

24:03.692 --> 24:05.485
What do you say
we arm some men

24:05.485 --> 24:06.570
and go out and
outnumber Garrison?

24:06.570 --> 24:07.988
[crowd erupting in agreement]

24:07.988 --> 24:09.740
Sending out a mob
to hunt down a gang of outlaws

24:09.740 --> 24:12.285
is a sure way to get
innocent people killed.

24:12.285 --> 24:14.287
Listen up, everyone,

24:14.287 --> 24:15.829
If Jake Garrison wanted
to hurt anyone

24:15.829 --> 24:17.081
here in Hope Valley,

24:17.081 --> 24:18.332
I believe he would have
tried to do it by now.

24:18.332 --> 24:20.500
What he wants,

24:20.500 --> 24:22.002
and apparently
he's succeeding,

24:22.002 --> 24:23.879
is to scare us into
turning against one another.

24:23.879 --> 24:26.257
Garrison wants Frank
to join up with him again.

24:26.257 --> 24:27.758
That's all.

24:27.758 --> 24:30.094
Now, I'm not going to
let that happen, Frank.

24:30.094 --> 24:31.887
I'm not going to let anything
bad happen to Hope Valley.

24:31.887 --> 24:34.181
And you're not alone.

24:34.181 --> 24:35.849
If they do come,
we'll be ready.

24:35.849 --> 24:37.517
We can take shifts
watching the streets.

24:37.517 --> 24:39.395
I'll take the first watch.

24:39.395 --> 24:40.520
As long as you just watch.

24:40.520 --> 24:41.605
No heroics.

24:41.605 --> 24:43.816
That goes for
all of you.

24:43.816 --> 24:44.775
If any of you see
anything suspicious,

24:44.775 --> 24:45.943
you come straight to me

24:45.943 --> 24:46.735
or Bill.

24:46.735 --> 24:48.446
Understand?

24:48.446 --> 24:49.529
Yeah.

24:49.529 --> 24:50.948
Good.

24:55.911 --> 24:58.622
I think you should
stay away from Abigail.

24:58.622 --> 25:00.707
At least
until this is over.

25:00.707 --> 25:01.834
At least?

25:01.834 --> 25:02.835
You know what I mean.

25:02.835 --> 25:05.254
Yeah, I think I do.

25:05.254 --> 25:07.465
This is about Abigail's safety,
nothing else.

25:07.465 --> 25:08.548
Garrison will
leave her alone

25:08.548 --> 25:10.843
if you stay
clear of her.

25:11.677 --> 25:13.262
You're right.

25:13.262 --> 25:14.554
I'll stay clear.

25:14.554 --> 25:17.515
Until Garrison gets arrested.

25:22.729 --> 25:25.191
[Elizabeth] Were you able
to get any sleep at all?

25:25.191 --> 25:27.567
A little,
but it wasn't easy.

25:27.567 --> 25:29.362
Abigail, it's okay
to be scared.

25:29.362 --> 25:31.571
If I'm scared,
then those monsters win,

25:31.571 --> 25:32.698
and I will not let them win.

25:32.698 --> 25:35.533
Well, at least close down
the cafe for a few days.

25:35.533 --> 25:36.576
I can't.

25:36.576 --> 25:37.535
Can't or won't?

25:38.578 --> 25:40.747
Maybe a little of both.

25:40.747 --> 25:42.749
But do you think that
Cody could stay with you

25:42.749 --> 25:44.251
until this is all over?

25:44.251 --> 25:45.294
Of course.

25:45.294 --> 25:47.713
There's nothing to be
afraid of, Miss Abigail.

25:47.713 --> 25:48.881
I won't let anyone hurt you.

25:48.881 --> 25:51.425
I know, sweetheart,

25:51.425 --> 25:52.968
and I promise, they won't,

25:52.968 --> 25:55.012
but it's important that you stay
with Miss Thatcher for now.

25:55.012 --> 25:57.306
But don't you need me here?

25:58.516 --> 26:00.600
Cody, I need you to be safe,

26:00.600 --> 26:03.396
and to work on getting that
wonderful spelling certificate.

26:04.938 --> 26:06.606
Come on, let's go
pack your bag.

26:08.817 --> 26:10.568
[♪♪♪]

26:22.664 --> 26:24.166
Clara...

26:25.625 --> 26:27.503
Jesse...

26:30.256 --> 26:31.048
you scared me.

26:31.048 --> 26:32.550
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

26:32.550 --> 26:34.009
What are you
doing here?

26:34.009 --> 26:35.635
I came back to tell you,

26:35.635 --> 26:37.221
you have to
warn Frank.

26:37.221 --> 26:39.390
Garrisons are
coming for him.

26:39.390 --> 26:41.141
If he doesn't go with them,
they'll kill him.

26:41.141 --> 26:42.642
You have to tell
Constable Thornton.

26:42.642 --> 26:43.643
No, I gotta get out of here.

26:43.643 --> 26:46.772
You can't keep
running forever.

26:46.772 --> 26:48.357
If Jake finds me,
he'll kill me.

26:48.357 --> 26:50.817
Then you have to stand
and fight,

26:50.817 --> 26:52.570
or you're going to be
looking over your shoulder

26:52.570 --> 26:53.904
for the rest
of your life.

26:53.904 --> 26:56.449
You can make
a new life here, Jesse.

26:56.449 --> 26:58.658
I don't know...

26:58.658 --> 27:00.244
If Matt Landry can do it,
so can you.

27:00.244 --> 27:03.080
He's a better man than I am.

27:03.080 --> 27:05.999
I don't believe that.

27:05.999 --> 27:07.625
I believe in you, Jesse.

27:09.836 --> 27:11.464
It's time you start
believing in yourself.

27:11.464 --> 27:14.300
Right now, your
friend needs you.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.843
Are you going to
run out on him?

27:25.852 --> 27:28.646
How is he?

27:28.646 --> 27:29.731
His foot was infected,

27:29.731 --> 27:30.857
but he's going to be fine.

27:30.857 --> 27:31.942
I gave him something
for the pain.

27:31.942 --> 27:33.319
It should help him rest.

27:33.319 --> 27:36.696
I think we got off
to a bad start,

27:36.696 --> 27:37.990
and I'm sorry for that.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.575
Don't worry about it.

27:39.575 --> 27:41.619
It's very hard when someone
you care about gets hurt.

27:41.619 --> 27:44.371
Still, I didn't mean
to tell you how to do your job.

27:44.371 --> 27:46.748
And I guess
I owe you an apology

27:46.748 --> 27:48.542
for that trick with the bell.

27:48.542 --> 27:49.627
[chuckles]

27:49.627 --> 27:51.504
It's all right,
I probably deserved it.

27:51.504 --> 27:52.712
No, you didn't.

27:52.712 --> 27:55.299
Maybe just a little.

27:56.925 --> 27:59.386
Thank you for taking
such good care of him.

27:59.386 --> 28:00.804
It's what I do.

28:00.804 --> 28:02.473
[chuckles fondly]

28:06.519 --> 28:07.561
[sighing heavily]

28:07.561 --> 28:08.937
Oh, Lee...

28:10.564 --> 28:12.690
I'm so glad you're
going to be all right.

28:14.067 --> 28:15.402
But you scared me
half to death,

28:15.402 --> 28:17.237
you heartless man.

28:18.905 --> 28:22.159
When I heard about
your accident...

28:22.159 --> 28:26.330
I didn't know what to do.

28:26.330 --> 28:30.334
I couldn't imagine
my life without you,

28:30.334 --> 28:33.671
and that scares me
even more.

28:33.671 --> 28:35.005
What I'm
trying to say is,

28:35.005 --> 28:39.801
don't you dare get hurt,

28:39.801 --> 28:41.637
and don't you dare

28:41.637 --> 28:44.473
ever leave me.

29:13.919 --> 29:15.795
It's been a long time
since I've been in church.

29:15.795 --> 29:17.506
Well, things could have
been different

29:17.506 --> 29:19.758
if you'd spent
more time in one.

29:22.802 --> 29:24.804
Good to see you boys.

29:24.804 --> 29:26.306
Well,

29:26.306 --> 29:27.766
this isn't a social visit, Matt,

29:27.766 --> 29:29.393
but you guessed that.

29:29.393 --> 29:31.103
Nah, there's a gold train
coming this way,

29:31.103 --> 29:33.272
and we need
your help.

29:33.272 --> 29:34.856
Well, I don't want
any part of it,

29:34.856 --> 29:36.734
but thanks for asking.

29:36.734 --> 29:37.817
[chuckles]

29:37.817 --> 29:38.985
Well...

29:38.985 --> 29:40.446
you better change your mind,

29:40.446 --> 29:42.989
'cause I don't want to start
hurting people, but I will,

29:42.989 --> 29:45.325
starting with that
pretty lady of yours.

29:47.202 --> 29:49.079
You touch Abigail,
and I will end you.

29:54.918 --> 29:56.086
Well...

29:56.086 --> 29:57.254
maybe I won't kill her,

29:57.254 --> 29:58.797
maybe I'll just bring
her along for the ride.

30:01.007 --> 30:04.803
All right, Jake, you win.

30:06.054 --> 30:08.014
I always do.

30:08.014 --> 30:10.476
Pick him up.

30:16.898 --> 30:18.108
[gun cocks]

30:18.108 --> 30:19.318
Stop right there.

30:21.445 --> 30:22.862
Don't do it.

30:22.862 --> 30:23.781
[henchman groans]

30:41.381 --> 30:43.634
Frank!
[shot fires]

30:43.634 --> 30:45.844
[groaning]

30:46.928 --> 30:48.639
You got this?

30:48.639 --> 30:49.848
I got it.

30:56.480 --> 30:57.939
[groans]

30:57.939 --> 31:01.109
I won't miss from here.

31:04.571 --> 31:05.823
Do I know you?

31:05.823 --> 31:07.825
Let's just say I'm a friend
of Carl Benson's.

31:07.825 --> 31:09.951
Got killed in a bank robbery.

31:09.951 --> 31:11.077
Or so I heard.

31:11.077 --> 31:12.912
You should know you killed him,

31:12.912 --> 31:13.997
along with Silas Ramsey,

31:13.997 --> 31:15.582
and who knows how many others.

31:15.582 --> 31:17.083
You got no proof.

31:17.083 --> 31:18.335
I'll get it.

31:18.335 --> 31:19.461
Maybe not from you,

31:19.461 --> 31:20.920
but I'm sure
one of your buddies back there

31:20.920 --> 31:22.214
is willing to talk.

31:23.923 --> 31:25.175
Your friend?

31:25.175 --> 31:27.177
He died on his knees,

31:27.177 --> 31:29.596
begging for his life.

31:29.596 --> 31:31.515
I guess he didn't
beg hard enough.

31:31.515 --> 31:33.892
Well, you're not gonna
have a chance to beg.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.686
Don't do it!

31:36.936 --> 31:38.647
Now, I know
how you feel,

31:38.647 --> 31:39.981
but you cannot shoot him
in cold blood.

31:39.981 --> 31:41.400
Watch me.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.652
Bill...

31:43.652 --> 31:45.111
he's going to get what's
coming to him, believe me.

31:45.111 --> 31:46.655
You pull that trigger,

31:46.655 --> 31:48.407
you're going to spend the rest
of your life in prison.

31:51.827 --> 31:53.953
Put down
the gun, Bill.

31:53.953 --> 31:56.122
Put down your gun.

32:04.964 --> 32:06.800
Thanks, Clara.

32:06.800 --> 32:07.634
Miss Abigail!

32:07.634 --> 32:09.344
I was really
worried about you.

32:09.344 --> 32:11.722
Oh, I told you I'd be fine.

32:11.722 --> 32:13.056
Get your books,
I'll walk you to school.

32:13.056 --> 32:15.183
The spelling contest is today.

32:15.183 --> 32:18.978
Oh! We can practice
on the way there.

32:18.978 --> 32:21.398
So it's over
with Garrison and Frank?

32:21.398 --> 32:22.441
Finally.

32:22.441 --> 32:23.400
Are you all right?

32:23.400 --> 32:24.276
I think so.

32:24.276 --> 32:25.235
I'm going to talk
to Frank later.

32:25.235 --> 32:26.612
You've been through so much.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.280
I can't imagine what you must
be feeling right now.

32:28.280 --> 32:29.948
Well, they say
what doesn't kill you

32:29.948 --> 32:30.949
makes you stronger.

32:30.949 --> 32:31.991
Then I think you must be

32:31.991 --> 32:34.536
one of the strongest women
I know.

32:34.536 --> 32:35.704
[chuckling]

32:48.383 --> 32:49.927
I owe you one, Jack.

32:49.927 --> 32:51.010
What for?

32:51.010 --> 32:52.805
For making me take
my finger

32:52.805 --> 32:55.390
off the trigger.

32:55.390 --> 32:58.017
The Garrisons deserve
to be locked away, not you.

32:58.017 --> 33:01.020
You know how hard it is
for me to play by the rules.

33:01.020 --> 33:02.522
I do.

33:02.522 --> 33:05.609
That's why my days
as a Mountie are over.

33:06.693 --> 33:07.820
You sure about that?

33:07.820 --> 33:09.112
I'm sure.

33:09.112 --> 33:11.197
Well, the Mounties' loss
is the Pinkertons' gain.

33:11.197 --> 33:12.991
I'm won't be taking
that job, either.

33:12.991 --> 33:15.034
No?

33:15.034 --> 33:16.912
I think I do my best work

33:16.912 --> 33:18.831
when I don't have to
answer to anyone.

33:18.831 --> 33:20.624
Well, I'd have to
agree with that.

33:20.624 --> 33:21.792
[chuckles]

33:21.792 --> 33:23.084
Well, what
do you know, Jack,

33:23.084 --> 33:25.044
for the first time in my life,

33:25.044 --> 33:27.005
I get to choose to do
whatever I want.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.047
Whatever you choose,

33:28.047 --> 33:29.800
I hope you stay in Hope Valley.

33:29.800 --> 33:31.718
I'll always have your back.

33:31.718 --> 33:34.554
That goes both ways, Jack.

33:34.554 --> 33:36.014
I know.

33:42.061 --> 33:45.565
I have never been
more proud of this class.

33:45.565 --> 33:48.485
You all worked so hard,

33:48.485 --> 33:51.446
and it shows by your scores
on your spelling tests.

33:51.446 --> 33:52.489
Yes, Robert?

33:52.489 --> 33:54.366
When are you going to
hand out the awards?

33:54.366 --> 33:56.368
Right now.

33:56.368 --> 33:57.619
First up,

33:57.619 --> 33:58.578
we have...

33:58.578 --> 34:00.580
Opal.

34:00.580 --> 34:01.581
100%!

34:01.581 --> 34:05.084
applause]

34:05.084 --> 34:06.586
Very good work, Opal.

34:06.586 --> 34:08.087
Thank you.

34:08.087 --> 34:10.716
Next up, we have...

34:10.716 --> 34:11.758
Cody.

34:11.758 --> 34:13.301
100%!

34:13.301 --> 34:15.094
[applause]

34:15.094 --> 34:17.222
Miss Abigail will be
very proud.

34:21.643 --> 34:23.520
Next, we have...

34:27.524 --> 34:29.526
Abigail, I'm so sorry.

34:29.526 --> 34:33.112
For what?

34:33.112 --> 34:36.115
For what
could've happened.

34:36.115 --> 34:39.619
I can live with that, Frank.

34:39.619 --> 34:43.874
I couldn't live
with giving in to fear.

34:43.874 --> 34:47.419
You don't
scare easy, do you?

34:47.419 --> 34:50.839
No, I don't.

34:52.424 --> 34:55.427
Neither do I.

34:55.427 --> 34:57.679
You think you can
live with that?

34:57.679 --> 35:00.057
I don't know,

35:00.057 --> 35:02.768
but I think
I need to find out.

35:12.151 --> 35:13.946
Do you think she knows?

35:13.946 --> 35:16.155
I know she does.

35:16.155 --> 35:18.199
And she's at peace.

35:20.243 --> 35:22.161
So am I.

35:22.161 --> 35:23.580
Thank you for that.

35:39.721 --> 35:41.180
Mr. Avery?

35:41.180 --> 35:43.141
Would you pray with me?

35:53.986 --> 35:55.403
[chatting quietly]

35:55.403 --> 35:56.655
Excuse me.

35:56.655 --> 35:58.073
Faith!

35:58.073 --> 35:59.825
Fait, wait up.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.660
How's Lee doing?

36:01.660 --> 36:02.744
Fine.

36:02.744 --> 36:04.579
He should be back on his feet
in a day or two.

36:04.579 --> 36:06.205
Well, good.

36:06.205 --> 36:08.207
Is something wrong?

36:08.207 --> 36:10.209
No. No, it's nothing.

36:10.209 --> 36:11.503
You sure?
Maybe I can help.

36:11.503 --> 36:13.171
You can't.

36:14.213 --> 36:15.507
Bad news from home?

36:15.507 --> 36:16.758
No, no,

36:16.758 --> 36:18.010
not at all.

36:18.010 --> 36:20.053
Um... it's personal.

36:20.053 --> 36:21.513
I'm sorry, Jack.

36:21.513 --> 36:23.015
I have to go.

36:27.102 --> 36:29.228
Miss Abigail!
Miss Abigail!

36:29.228 --> 36:30.355
Whoa, Cody, slow down.

36:30.355 --> 36:32.065
Where's Miss Abigail?

36:32.065 --> 36:33.191
She's out with Pastor Frank.

36:33.191 --> 36:34.275
Don't worry,

36:34.275 --> 36:35.318
you can show her
your certificate

36:35.318 --> 36:36.319
as soon as
she gets home.

36:36.319 --> 36:38.237
But I want to show her now.

36:38.237 --> 36:39.280
But she isn't here now.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.240
She's never here.
She's always busy.

36:41.240 --> 36:42.868
Cody, that's not true.

36:44.243 --> 36:46.663
Who cares about
a stupid certificate anyway?

37:03.262 --> 37:04.848
Cody, what's wrong?

37:04.848 --> 37:06.265
You won't understand.

37:06.265 --> 37:07.976
I could try.

37:07.976 --> 37:09.268
I know it's hard

37:09.268 --> 37:11.563
having to share Miss Abigail
with other people.

37:11.563 --> 37:14.858
Would you like
to know a secret?

37:16.275 --> 37:17.944
Constable Thornton told me

37:17.944 --> 37:19.154
that he didn't like it

37:19.154 --> 37:20.947
when his mom went out
without him either,

37:20.947 --> 37:22.908
but it didn't mean
she didn't care about him.

37:22.908 --> 37:25.243
It's not the same.

37:25.243 --> 37:27.204
Well, I think he felt
a lot like you do.

37:27.204 --> 37:29.288
But Miss Abigail's
not my mother!

37:29.288 --> 37:31.290
No, she's not, but--

37:31.290 --> 37:33.001
Anna says Miss Abigail
can't love me

37:33.001 --> 37:34.086
the way a real mom can.

37:34.086 --> 37:36.171
Anna's wrong.

37:36.171 --> 37:37.797
No, she isn't.
I don't belong here.

37:37.797 --> 37:39.298
Cody, that's not true.

37:39.298 --> 37:42.802
Yes, it is.
I don't belong anywhere.

37:44.096 --> 37:47.306
Have you ever heard the story
of the ugly duckling?

37:49.350 --> 37:51.352
Well, there once was
a little duckling,

37:51.352 --> 37:55.314
and he thought he didn't
belong anywhere either.

37:55.314 --> 37:57.483
And all the ducks
and other birds

37:57.483 --> 37:59.360
would make fun of him, and...

37:59.360 --> 38:01.613
he thought
no one cared about him.

38:04.199 --> 38:05.324
And then one day,

38:05.324 --> 38:09.121
he met a family of swans.

38:09.121 --> 38:11.206
And guess what?

38:11.206 --> 38:13.250
He found he fit right in.

38:13.250 --> 38:16.294
It wasn't the family
he was born into,

38:16.294 --> 38:18.296
but it was the family
he was meant to be with.

38:18.296 --> 38:21.466
You're a swan, Cody,

38:21.466 --> 38:24.510
and you found your family,

38:24.510 --> 38:27.430
and that family is Miss Abigail.

38:27.430 --> 38:31.309
But I'm not her real family,
I just live in her house.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.478
No, you don't.

38:33.478 --> 38:35.897
You live in her heart.

38:44.489 --> 38:46.365
[groans] Ah...

38:46.365 --> 38:48.201
Thanks for the game.

38:51.454 --> 38:53.623
I hear Jesse's on the mend.

38:53.623 --> 38:55.292
Yeah, he's going to
be all right.

38:55.292 --> 38:57.376
Turns out he did
the right thing after all.

38:57.376 --> 38:58.503
You sound surprised.

38:58.503 --> 38:59.796
I am.

38:59.796 --> 39:01.756
I guess those prayers
of yours paid off.

39:01.756 --> 39:03.175
They usually do.

39:03.175 --> 39:05.093
But you didn't come
here to talk to me

39:05.093 --> 39:07.887
about the power
of prayer, did you?

39:07.887 --> 39:09.181
No.

39:09.181 --> 39:11.141
I came to thank you
for everything you did for me.

39:12.391 --> 39:14.352
Don't thank me, thank Jack.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.854
I had a score to settle
with Garrison.

39:22.027 --> 39:24.237
I thought you boys
were on the clock?

39:24.237 --> 39:25.155
Not anymore.

39:25.155 --> 39:27.448
Another axle broke
on a delivery wagon.

39:27.448 --> 39:28.908
It's the third
one this week.

39:28.908 --> 39:31.410
Looks like we're gonna
miss another deadline.

39:31.410 --> 39:32.537
That must be bad for business.

39:32.537 --> 39:33.913
You're not kidding.

39:33.913 --> 39:36.124
First, Mr. Coulter
gets hurt, now this?

39:36.124 --> 39:37.834
If things don't start
turning around,

39:37.834 --> 39:40.086
we're gonna start losing
a lot of contracts.

39:40.086 --> 39:42.922
And Mr. Coulter's not
going to be happy about that.

39:47.177 --> 39:48.427
I don't blame Anna.

39:48.427 --> 39:50.763
I don't think
she meant to hurt Cody.

39:50.763 --> 39:52.307
Oh, of course not.

39:52.307 --> 39:54.684
I just wish I had known
a little sooner.

39:54.684 --> 39:57.436
Well, we've all been
a little distracted lately.

39:57.436 --> 40:00.148
And Cody hadn't mentioned it
to me until just now.

40:01.191 --> 40:03.442
I need to tell Cody
that Anna was wrong.

40:03.442 --> 40:05.403
Children always know the truth
when they hear it.

40:05.403 --> 40:08.698
Which is exactly
what I'm going to tell him.

41:04.045 --> 41:07.006
I'm glad
you're still awake.

41:07.006 --> 41:10.051
I thought you'd be mad
'cause I have school tomorrow.

41:10.051 --> 41:12.220
Sometimes, it's okay
to bend the rules

41:12.220 --> 41:14.055
now and again.

41:15.098 --> 41:17.475
Do you know why
you're so special to me?

41:19.352 --> 41:22.605
Because God put you
in my life for a reason,

41:22.605 --> 41:26.067
and the moment you were here,
I knew I wanted you to stay.

41:26.067 --> 41:29.528
I never thought about it
like that.

41:29.528 --> 41:31.281
Well, think about this,

41:31.281 --> 41:35.743
I need you just as much
as you need me,

41:35.743 --> 41:37.870
and that's why
we found each other.

41:37.870 --> 41:40.665
Like the ugly duckling
found his real family?

41:40.665 --> 41:43.209
Just like that.

41:43.209 --> 41:46.545
You're my real family, Cody,

41:46.545 --> 41:49.174
and I love you very much.

41:50.175 --> 41:53.261
I love you, too, Miss Abigail.

41:53.261 --> 41:54.512

41:54.512 --> 41:55.721
[Elizabeth writes] I needed
an ending to my story,

41:55.721 --> 41:57.349
and I found one.

41:57.349 --> 41:58.557
I found it

41:58.557 --> 41:59.934
in how the people of Hope Valley
stood together

41:59.934 --> 42:02.561
to face their problems
and their fears,

42:02.561 --> 42:05.606
whether those fears
belonged to a whole town,

42:05.606 --> 42:09.194
or just to a little boy
who needed love.

42:09.194 --> 42:12.030
Tonight, in Hope Valley,

42:12.030 --> 42:14.407
our hearts rest peacefully,

42:14.407 --> 42:16.742
and safe.

42:27.670 --> 42:31.716
