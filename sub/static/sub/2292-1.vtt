02:58.280 --> 02:59.930
<i>Hello.</i>

03:02.600 --> 03:08.130
Thank you for giving me the opportunity
to talk to you today.

03:10.080 --> 03:12.447
My name is Mark Schultz.

03:12.920 --> 03:14.843
I wanna talk about America,

03:16.520 --> 03:19.091
and I wanna tell you why I wrestle.

03:36.720 --> 03:39.485
This is an Olympic gold medal.

03:40.760 --> 03:43.650
I won this three years ago

03:43.800 --> 03:47.646
at the 23rd Olympic Games
in Los Angeles, California.

03:49.280 --> 03:52.921
This is more than just
some piece of metal.

03:54.360 --> 03:57.330
It's about what the metal represents.

03:58.440 --> 04:01.728
The virtues it requires to attain it.

04:07.520 --> 04:13.971
Twenty dollars and zero cents.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.202
Is it Dave or David?

04:16.399 --> 04:18.243
No, it's Mark.

04:18.440 --> 04:20.204
Mark Schultz.

04:25.240 --> 04:26.924
Um...

04:27.480 --> 04:29.642
Yeah. Dave's my brother.

04:30.160 --> 04:32.128
Oh.
He was originally scheduled.

04:33.320 --> 04:34.845
Okay.

04:39.960 --> 04:42.008
We both won golds.

04:46.040 --> 04:48.486
Make it the
works, and coffee.

04:49.320 --> 04:50.401
- For here?
- Yes.

04:50.600 --> 04:53.046
Number two, number three, here.

06:20.320 --> 06:21.446
<i>Please come, coach.</i>

06:21.600 --> 06:24.251
We don't want to put any pressure
on you right now.

06:24.440 --> 06:28.525
- You gotta think it through and all that.
- No, I get it. I appreciate it.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.648
That's why I didn't wrestle him.

06:30.800 --> 06:33.644
But didn't you miss that match?
I missed that match.

07:02.120 --> 07:03.246
Hey, Mark.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.802
You know the guys
from U.S.A. Wrestling.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.281
Mark, how's it going?
Fred, Bruce, Greg.

07:10.440 --> 07:11.930
Hey, Mark.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.482
Well, all right.
All right.

07:16.640 --> 07:19.484
- Just give us a call.
- Appreciate it, Bruce.

07:19.640 --> 07:22.325
Thanks for coming all this way. Okay.
All right.

07:22.480 --> 07:25.404
- Hey, have a good workout.
- Thank you.

07:30.960 --> 07:32.689
Hey, buddy.

07:34.960 --> 07:36.246
You all right?

07:37.040 --> 07:39.611
Hey, you been calling my machine
and hanging up?

07:39.760 --> 07:42.081
What? Come on.

07:42.240 --> 07:45.642
What do you mean?
Somebody's leaving hang-ups

07:45.800 --> 07:47.962
on my machine.
Come on.

07:49.840 --> 07:51.285
Come on.

08:10.760 --> 08:13.684
How you doing, buddy?
You all right?

08:18.000 --> 08:19.809
Okay.

09:10.840 --> 09:13.161
Mark. Come on.

09:14.080 --> 09:15.491
Keep your hips in.

09:27.080 --> 09:29.208
Keep your hips in, Mark.

10:03.760 --> 10:05.364
Heh.

10:49.160 --> 10:52.289
Same time tomorrow?
Yeah.

10:58.560 --> 11:01.211
What'd the U.S.A.
Wrestling guys want?

11:02.280 --> 11:05.204
We're talking about me
doing some coaching.

11:05.840 --> 11:07.604
In Colorado.

11:16.480 --> 11:19.529
Hey. Give me a hug.

12:46.720 --> 12:48.165
Hello?

12:48.320 --> 12:50.766
<i>Hello. May I speak with Mark Schultz?</i>

12:51.720 --> 12:53.404
Speaking.

12:54.800 --> 12:57.121
<i>Mark Schultz, the Olympic wrestler?</i>

12:58.080 --> 12:59.570
Yeah. Who is this?

12:59.720 --> 13:02.326
<i>I'm calling on behalf
of Mr. John E. du Pont.</i>

13:02.480 --> 13:05.006
<i>He has been anxious
to get in touch with you.</i>

13:05.160 --> 13:09.688
<i>Who?
John E. du Pont of the du Pont family.</i>

13:10.640 --> 13:13.564
<i>Mr. du Pont asked that you consider
taking</i> a <i>day off</i>

13:13.720 --> 13:15.882
<i>to come out to Foxcatcher Farms,</i>

13:16.040 --> 13:18.725
<i>so you men can meet face-to-face.</i>

13:18.880 --> 13:20.644
About what?

13:21.080 --> 13:24.402
<i>He'd like to discuss it in person
in Pennsylvania.</i>

13:24.560 --> 13:28.087
<i>If I may, I'd like to make travel
arrangements for you, Mr. Schultz.</i>

13:28.280 --> 13:30.169
<i>First class, of course.</i>

13:30.920 --> 13:33.082
Who'd you say again?

13:33.240 --> 13:37.609
<i>John E. du Pont,
of the du Pont family.</i>

13:44.000 --> 13:47.561
<i>Welcome to Philadelphia
International Airport.</i>

14:01.800 --> 14:05.850
Mark, Mr. du Pont wanted
to fly you himself today.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.005
But last minute, he got called in by
the Newtown Square Police Department.

14:11.200 --> 14:13.328
For tactical support.

14:15.160 --> 14:18.164
He should be back at the estate
by the time we get there.

14:20.720 --> 14:23.530
By the way,
that's Valley Forge below you.

15:04.760 --> 15:06.603
This is the library.

15:08.600 --> 15:11.046
Mr. du Pont should be here
in a few minutes.

15:11.200 --> 15:12.326
Okay.

15:56.440 --> 15:58.044
Mark.

15:58.920 --> 16:00.763
John du Pont.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.808
Thrilled.
Thrilled that you're here.

16:03.960 --> 16:05.121
Let's go downstairs.

16:07.800 --> 16:11.168
We call this the trophy room,
for obvious reasons.

16:11.360 --> 16:12.930
Have a seat.

16:22.840 --> 16:24.365
How was your flight?

16:24.520 --> 16:25.806
It was good.
Good.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.445
Thank you.

16:29.520 --> 16:31.887
Can I get you something
to eat or drink?

16:32.040 --> 16:33.849
Oh, no. No, I'm good. Thank you.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.321
I could have them
whip you up something.

16:36.480 --> 16:39.051
No, sir, I'm fine.

16:39.200 --> 16:40.690
Good.

16:42.640 --> 16:45.610
Well, I know how busy
you must be.

16:45.760 --> 16:48.491
I assume you're training for the Worlds?
Yes, sir.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.244
Good.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.249
It's a big one.

16:55.120 --> 16:56.884
How is training?

16:57.440 --> 16:58.805
It's good. Um...

16:58.960 --> 17:00.450
It's intense.

17:01.040 --> 17:02.929
We're in two-a-days.

17:05.560 --> 17:08.211
Conditioning and weights
in the morning

17:08.359 --> 17:10.362
and technique...

17:10.520 --> 17:12.329
We wrestle in the evenings.

17:12.480 --> 17:15.723
That's good. Get yourself prepared.

17:15.880 --> 17:17.689
Work hard.

17:19.640 --> 17:22.086
You look good. You look strong.

17:22.800 --> 17:24.131
Fit.
Thank you, sir.

17:24.280 --> 17:26.203
Feeling confident?

17:27.839 --> 17:31.811
That's one of the most important
elements of entering a match

17:31.960 --> 17:36.249
is feeling the confidence,
knowing that you're going to win.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.448
Feeling it inside.

17:39.920 --> 17:43.720
If you go to a match knowing
that you're going to win that match,

17:43.880 --> 17:47.168
odds are
you're going to win that match.

17:48.240 --> 17:50.607
You're training
with your brother Dave?

17:50.760 --> 17:53.001
Yes, sir.
Great Dave Schultz?

17:53.160 --> 17:55.527
Yeah.
I'm talking to the great Mark Schultz.

18:02.320 --> 18:05.051
Do you have any idea
why I asked you to come here?

18:05.200 --> 18:06.690
No.
No.

18:06.840 --> 18:09.923
Well, Mark, do you...?

18:10.080 --> 18:12.481
Do you have any idea who I am?

18:14.080 --> 18:15.764
No. No.

18:15.920 --> 18:19.766
Some rich guy calls you
on the phone.

18:22.120 --> 18:25.647
"I want Mark Schultz to come visit me."

18:28.680 --> 18:31.923
Well, I'm a... I'm a wrestling coach.

18:33.120 --> 18:39.526
And I have a deep love
of the sport of wrestling.

18:40.240 --> 18:43.847
And I wanted to speak with you
about your future.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.731
About what you hope to achieve.

18:48.960 --> 18:51.566
What do you hope to achieve, Mark?

18:57.520 --> 19:02.321
Well, I wanna be the best
in the world.

19:03.760 --> 19:06.127
I wanna go to Worlds and win gold.

19:06.720 --> 19:12.807
I wanna go to the '88 Olympics
in Seoul and win gold.

19:15.040 --> 19:16.565
Good.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.643
I'm proud of you.

19:21.560 --> 19:24.086
Are you getting the support
that you need?

19:25.120 --> 19:26.724
What do you mean, sir?

19:28.560 --> 19:32.804
Well, you know how the Soviets
support their wrestlers.

19:36.640 --> 19:37.721
I do.

19:37.880 --> 19:42.283
Mark, we as a nation
have failed to honor you.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.563
And that's a problem.

19:48.360 --> 19:52.251
Not just for you, but for our society.

19:54.280 --> 19:58.490
When we fail to honor that
which should be honored,

19:59.960 --> 20:01.928
it's a problem.

20:03.760 --> 20:06.206
It's a canary in a coal mine.

20:08.480 --> 20:10.369
Do you bird-watch?

20:11.480 --> 20:13.847
Uh, no.
You can learn a lot from birds.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.445
I'm an ornithologist.

20:15.600 --> 20:18.570
But more importantly, I am a patriot.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.841
And I want to see
this country soar again.

20:27.120 --> 20:29.088
I want that too.

20:29.680 --> 20:31.569
I can see that.

21:18.240 --> 21:22.404
I'd like us to go to Seoul,
stun the world.

21:25.440 --> 21:27.283
What do you think?

21:50.920 --> 21:53.764
Three thousand men died here.

21:56.600 --> 22:00.730
These patriots were willing
to give up everything...

22:03.200 --> 22:05.441
including their lives...

22:07.320 --> 22:09.129
for freedom.

22:13.560 --> 22:19.169
I like to come here
to remind myself what really matters.

22:25.680 --> 22:28.206
We're going to do great things, Mark.

22:29.880 --> 22:31.723
Great things.

22:32.200 --> 22:33.690
Yes, sir.

22:49.920 --> 22:54.847
<i>♪ Can you answer?
Yes I can ♪</i>

22:55.040 --> 23:01.571
<i>♪ But what would be the answer
To the answer man? ♪♪</i>

23:03.720 --> 23:05.529
Hey, Mark.
Hey.

23:05.680 --> 23:08.286
Can I talk to you for a second?
Hey, Mark. Yeah.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.526
Can I talk to him?
Go on.

23:11.680 --> 23:14.081
Here! Do something.

23:17.600 --> 23:22.527
The country has lost their morals
and values, and the kids are lost

23:22.680 --> 23:25.684
and they don't have role models,
and I agreed with him.

23:25.880 --> 23:27.370
Hm.
Everything he was saying.

23:27.520 --> 23:31.889
I couldn't believe
he was saying stuff that I...
It was in my head all the time.

23:32.640 --> 23:34.927
Did you guys talk...?
Did you talk money?

23:35.080 --> 23:36.809
Yeah, yeah.
What's he talking?

23:36.960 --> 23:39.122
You ready?
Yeah.

23:39.280 --> 23:42.807
Twenty-five thousand a year.

23:44.200 --> 23:45.850
He said, "Name your price"

23:46.000 --> 23:48.571
and I just said the highest price
in my head.

23:48.720 --> 23:51.883
And we get to handpick our team.

23:53.560 --> 23:55.369
Who are you gonna train with?

23:55.520 --> 23:57.363
No. No, we're...

23:57.520 --> 24:02.003
I meant "we" as in me and you,
together, picking a team.

24:02.600 --> 24:05.968
Mr. du Pont and I
would love to have you.

24:08.840 --> 24:10.683
Mark, what's, uh...?

24:11.760 --> 24:13.842
What's he get out of all this?

24:14.000 --> 24:16.048
Mr. du Pont?
Yeah.

24:16.200 --> 24:18.567
America winning.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.043
You winning.
We talked about you.

24:21.200 --> 24:22.929
Me winning.

24:23.680 --> 24:27.162
Okay.
What are you thinking about, Dave?

24:27.360 --> 24:28.805
This is it.

24:29.480 --> 24:33.724
This is everything that we've...
That we've ever wanted.

24:37.840 --> 24:40.161
Mark, I can't leave.

24:42.080 --> 24:44.162
I'm settled here.

24:44.320 --> 24:46.527
Nancy's happy.

24:46.680 --> 24:49.206
Xander's doing well at school.

24:50.080 --> 24:51.241
They can come.

24:51.400 --> 24:52.606
Mark,

24:52.800 --> 24:55.929
I got a contract,
I got commitments.

24:57.240 --> 24:58.924
That's great for you.

25:00.400 --> 25:03.802
I should just pass this up
to be your training partner?

25:14.040 --> 25:16.611
Mark. Mark.

25:16.760 --> 25:19.240
This could be
a real good thing for you.

25:23.520 --> 25:25.568
I'm proud of you.

25:27.400 --> 25:30.847
I think you can make something
real good for yourself here.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.570
Yeah?
Yeah.

25:43.920 --> 25:45.922
I love you, Mark.

27:39.360 --> 27:43.126
Hi. ls, uh, Mr. du Pont home?

27:43.280 --> 27:45.851
Is Mr. du Pont expecting you?

27:46.000 --> 27:47.445
Yes, ma'am.

27:48.080 --> 27:53.484
Not at this exact moment,
but, you know, this week sometime.

27:55.400 --> 27:57.721
I'm Mark Schultz.

27:58.720 --> 28:01.041
Have a seat here,
for a moment.

28:01.240 --> 28:03.811
I need to...

28:04.720 --> 28:05.960
Do you have a commode?

28:06.160 --> 28:08.731
Or, like, a washroom
or something I could use?

28:08.880 --> 28:11.611
Just in there to the left.
Thank you.

28:45.640 --> 28:47.563
Mr. Beck will see you now.

28:47.720 --> 28:50.485
I'm... I'm sorry. Who?

28:50.880 --> 28:52.882
All right. How old are you, Mark?

28:53.080 --> 28:54.241
Twenty-seven.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.526
Education?

28:55.680 --> 28:57.728
University of Oklahoma.

28:57.920 --> 28:59.843
Undergraduate?

29:00.000 --> 29:02.446
And you graduated?
Yes, sir.

29:03.960 --> 29:05.849
Do you own any property, Mark?

29:06.000 --> 29:07.445
No.

29:08.680 --> 29:10.603
Are your parents still together?

29:10.760 --> 29:12.125
No.

29:12.280 --> 29:14.806
How old were you
when they separated?

29:16.680 --> 29:18.091
Two.

29:18.600 --> 29:20.489
Who raised you?

29:21.280 --> 29:23.806
Well, we moved around a lot.

29:23.960 --> 29:26.611
But my brother, mainly.

29:29.040 --> 29:30.610
Okay.

29:31.160 --> 29:33.481
Mark, have you ever been accused
of a crime?

29:33.640 --> 29:35.290
No, sir.

29:35.440 --> 29:36.771
I...

29:36.960 --> 29:39.167
Mr. du Pont.
Oh, you're here.

29:39.320 --> 29:41.084
Yes, I drove straight down.

29:48.080 --> 29:50.242
Tonight's speech.

29:51.200 --> 29:53.202
Okay.

29:56.080 --> 29:58.606
So they're putting him
in the chalet?

29:58.760 --> 30:01.366
Yes, sir.
Hm.

30:06.440 --> 30:08.761
Excellent bed.

30:11.240 --> 30:13.322
Good mattress. Firm.

30:14.560 --> 30:16.528
- That's great. Thank you.
- All right.

30:16.680 --> 30:17.966
Good.

30:27.560 --> 30:31.690
Utilities are paid for,
gas, electric, water.

30:31.840 --> 30:34.605
Kitchen, dining room.
Refrigerator is fully stocked.

30:34.760 --> 30:36.569
Office.

30:45.520 --> 30:47.568
Here's a key for you.

30:47.720 --> 30:49.370
Thank you.

30:55.160 --> 30:58.562
The gym is close.
You can almost see it.

30:58.720 --> 31:01.121
Couple hundred yards up
is the big house,

31:01.280 --> 31:03.487
in case you ever get invited
to dinner.

31:03.640 --> 31:06.405
Otherwise, it is off-limits.
Okay.

31:06.560 --> 31:11.043
Also, the horses that you saw
on the way in,

31:11.960 --> 31:14.247
they all belong
to Mr. du Pont's mother.

31:14.880 --> 31:16.848
They're all world-class animals.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.002
They're also off-limits.

31:23.400 --> 31:25.368
Your history of the du Pont dynasty.

31:29.280 --> 31:30.930
One more thing:

31:31.080 --> 31:33.242
Just between you and me,

31:33.920 --> 31:38.608
if you happen to see Mrs. du Pont,
just give her her privacy.

31:39.760 --> 31:41.762
Yeah, of course.

31:42.800 --> 31:44.370
Anything else I can get you?

31:44.520 --> 31:47.046
No. No, no, I'm fine.

31:47.920 --> 31:49.763
Well, I think that's it.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.604
Have a good night.

31:53.360 --> 31:55.010
You too.

32:30.320 --> 32:35.008
<i>Du Pont, a dynasty of wealth
and power.</i>

32:39.840 --> 32:42.002
<i>America's need for ammunition</i>

32:42.160 --> 32:44.925
<i>enabled the family
to amass a fortune</i>

32:45.080 --> 32:47.606
<i>and grow their company
into what is today</i>

32:47.960 --> 32:50.884
<i>the largest chemical corporation
in the world.</i>

33:20.320 --> 33:21.765
Mr. du Pont?
Shh-shh-shh.

33:23.120 --> 33:24.281
Do you hear that?

33:25.720 --> 33:27.643
That's a barred owl.

33:29.240 --> 33:32.005
I hope it's not too late.
No, no, no.

33:32.160 --> 33:34.925
I wanted to make sure
that everything was all right.

33:35.720 --> 33:40.089
That everything was fine.
Drop a few things off
that I thought you might enjoy.

33:40.240 --> 33:42.447
Here are some field glasses.

33:43.080 --> 33:46.527
There are many varieties of birds
right here on the property.

33:46.680 --> 33:51.004
That'll give you a better vantage point.
Okay.

33:51.160 --> 33:55.245
And this is from 10 years ago,
but I thought you might
find it interesting.

33:55.400 --> 33:58.244
Wait, you wrote this?
I did, yeah.

33:59.720 --> 34:01.085
Thank you.

34:03.680 --> 34:06.126
How long do we have till the Worlds?

34:07.720 --> 34:11.440
Two months.
Well, a little less, actually.

34:13.080 --> 34:14.684
Well, we'll get it done.

34:15.080 --> 34:18.926
I promise you,
I'll give you everything I have.

34:19.639 --> 34:21.960
I have great faith in you, Mark.

34:23.280 --> 34:24.485
Thank you, sir.

34:24.639 --> 34:26.324
You're welcome.

34:27.960 --> 34:29.199
Night.

34:57.280 --> 35:00.170
Certainly Abraham Lincoln,
Teddy Roosevelt,

35:00.320 --> 35:02.971
they gave me something to aspire to.

35:03.160 --> 35:05.527
My father was a role model.

35:05.680 --> 35:07.603
Guys, introduce yourself.

35:13.480 --> 35:16.131
See you guys at 6? All right.

36:29.600 --> 36:32.080
Very good, I'll see
you in three months.

36:32.240 --> 36:33.446
Good.

36:36.720 --> 36:38.210
Mark.

36:39.320 --> 36:40.367
Come in.

36:43.440 --> 36:45.169
Have a seat.

36:49.200 --> 36:50.929
May I get you a drink?

36:51.080 --> 36:53.208
No. No, sir. I'm good.

36:53.360 --> 36:57.570
Good. Good man. In training.

37:01.560 --> 37:04.564
How is it looking
with your brother Dave?

37:07.160 --> 37:08.685
Dave?

37:09.720 --> 37:10.926
How do you mean?

37:11.120 --> 37:13.885
You said you were going
to talk to him again.

37:16.080 --> 37:17.366
I did.

37:17.520 --> 37:19.522
When is he coming?

37:21.240 --> 37:22.924
He's not.

37:24.080 --> 37:27.004
He... He's just not...

37:28.760 --> 37:32.401
He's just not willing
to uproot his family.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.810
Does he understand
what we're doing here, Mark?

37:36.960 --> 37:38.530
I told him.

37:39.360 --> 37:41.761
He just really doesn't wanna move.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.048
How much does he want?

37:53.600 --> 37:55.045
No, it's...

37:55.200 --> 37:57.282
It's not about that.

38:01.840 --> 38:03.604
About what?

38:04.200 --> 38:07.010
Well, you can't buy Dave.

38:20.440 --> 38:24.206
So the World Championships
are coming up soon?

38:24.400 --> 38:26.050
Yes, sir.

38:28.280 --> 38:30.328
I want you to win.

38:33.360 --> 38:35.249
That's why you're here.

40:15.640 --> 40:17.881
Everything okay, Mark?

40:20.120 --> 40:21.565
Yeah.

40:22.080 --> 40:23.684
What is it?

40:23.840 --> 40:25.569
What's wrong?

40:27.120 --> 40:28.610
Nothing. I'm... I'm fine.

40:29.920 --> 40:31.763
No, you're not.

40:37.160 --> 40:38.685
I just...

40:40.360 --> 40:42.681
I just don't wanna let you down.

41:00.840 --> 41:02.842
Do it! Go!

41:03.800 --> 41:05.086
That's it.

41:12.800 --> 41:16.043
- Attack! Attack!
- Control his rolling. Control his rolling.

41:16.240 --> 41:18.402
Keep your elbows in!

41:37.520 --> 41:39.170
Mark Schultz.

41:40.640 --> 41:42.290
Good job, Mark.

42:13.600 --> 42:15.204
Dave Schultz.

43:10.560 --> 43:11.846
Hello.
Hey, Xander.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.206
Hi.
Where's your dad?

43:13.400 --> 43:15.004
Over there. Hello.

43:15.160 --> 43:18.243
<i>- Hey, Mark. Come on in, buddy.
- Yah!</i>

43:18.400 --> 43:19.925
Oh, God, he's got me.

43:20.320 --> 43:23.642
Dave, I wanted to...
I want you to meet Mr. du Pont.

43:24.400 --> 43:27.483
Hold on a sec.
We got a guest. I gotta get up.

43:27.640 --> 43:30.086
- How you doing? I have to say hi.
- Keep him...

43:30.240 --> 43:32.527
No. We're not letting you up.

43:32.680 --> 43:34.887
I wanna say hi to Mr. du Pont. Hold on.

43:35.040 --> 43:37.611
- How you doing?
- Dad, come on.

43:37.800 --> 43:41.009
It's nice to meet you. Dave Schultz.
John du Pont.

43:41.160 --> 43:43.845
That's my wife, Nancy.
Hey.

43:44.280 --> 43:46.931
- Hello.
- My beautiful, relaxed children.

43:47.080 --> 43:48.809
- This is Xander and Dani.
- Hello.

43:48.960 --> 43:50.564
- Hi.
- They're eating me.

43:50.960 --> 43:53.406
Hey, Dani?
Dani, come here.

43:53.560 --> 43:57.121
Can I get you a drink?
No. No, I should go.

43:57.320 --> 43:59.049
Good luck tomorrow.

43:59.240 --> 44:01.242
Mark, thank you.

44:01.760 --> 44:04.206
You sure you don't want to...?
No, no.

44:04.360 --> 44:06.249
- No, Mark, stay.
- I'm gonna get you.

44:06.400 --> 44:08.243
Come here. Get your brother.

44:09.480 --> 44:12.211
- Hey. Okay. It's bedtime now.
- I can make an A.

44:12.360 --> 44:13.566
- No.
- Let's go.

44:14.920 --> 44:17.400
- Here it comes.
- Get ready for bed.

44:18.040 --> 44:21.567
Dave, I got that tape on Nanev.
Yeah, pop it in, buddy.

44:21.760 --> 44:25.401
- We need to check out his arm spin.
- We'll watch some wrestling.

44:25.600 --> 44:28.080
Get your arm up.
Get your arms out of there.

44:28.960 --> 44:30.564
There we go.

44:31.400 --> 44:34.085
- Hurry up. Let me go!
- I'll have to keep you here.

44:34.240 --> 44:36.288
- No.
- Let me get these tights off.

44:36.480 --> 44:39.324
- Good princess.
- Okay, get...

44:39.480 --> 44:42.689
Was it too much for you to come over
and just say hi to him?

44:44.440 --> 44:46.249
Aren't they fun?
Excuse me?

44:46.400 --> 44:48.767
You know who that is?
It's John du Pont.

44:49.320 --> 44:52.130
- I said hi, Mark.
- It's John du Pont.

44:52.280 --> 44:56.046
The most generous man in America.
You can't treat him like he's anyone.

44:56.200 --> 44:58.851
Mark, she said hi.
Mark, I said hi, okay?

44:59.000 --> 45:01.367
She said hi.
You said hi from over there.

45:01.520 --> 45:02.726
Buddy. Mark.

45:02.880 --> 45:05.565
- She said hi, pal.
- Mark.

45:05.760 --> 45:08.764
- You're in our room.
- I'm in your room? Okay. All right.

45:08.920 --> 45:11.161
Great. You know what?
You don't even know.

45:11.320 --> 45:14.210
You don't even know
what you don't know. You know that?

45:14.360 --> 45:15.486
Dave?
Dad.

45:15.640 --> 45:18.007
Mark.
Why? Dad.

45:18.160 --> 45:19.730
- No.
- Yes.

45:19.880 --> 45:22.406
- Dad.
- Buddy.

45:22.560 --> 45:23.925
Mark.

45:25.680 --> 45:28.490
Buddy. Come here.

45:29.920 --> 45:31.410
Come here.

45:32.280 --> 45:35.011
Give me the tape. Okay.

45:35.160 --> 45:40.041
Nanev can't set up his arm spin
without setting up himself.

45:40.200 --> 45:44.046
You just hit yours first.
When you feel him drive, hit it.

45:44.840 --> 45:45.921
All right?

45:46.080 --> 45:48.765
He's gonna drive and turn you and...

45:49.360 --> 45:51.010
There it is.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.685
That's it.
Drive him out. Drive him out.

45:54.840 --> 45:56.251
Drive him.

45:56.440 --> 45:58.522
Drive, drive!

46:37.560 --> 46:40.803
- Elbows deep, Mark.
- Drive! Drive!

46:41.600 --> 46:42.806
Five seconds, Mark!

46:43.400 --> 46:45.209
Drive him. That's it.

46:45.400 --> 46:48.085
Drive him, drive him, drive him!
Pop him up!

46:49.160 --> 46:51.162
Yeah!

46:51.320 --> 46:52.924
That's it, buddy!

46:53.120 --> 46:55.646
Yeah! Yeah!

46:58.120 --> 47:03.001
<i>U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!</i>

47:28.840 --> 47:31.491
Oh, there we go.

47:35.720 --> 47:37.643
Who needs a refill?

47:41.000 --> 47:43.480
Let's all get very drunk.

47:47.440 --> 47:50.364
Can I take a look at your medal?
Yeah. Yeah.

47:55.280 --> 47:57.521
What a fantastic evening.

47:58.520 --> 48:02.764
<i>♪ Fame, makes a man
Take things over ♪</i>

48:03.560 --> 48:07.770
<i>♪ Fame, lets him loose
Hard to swallow ♪</i>

48:08.640 --> 48:13.009
<i>♪ Fame, puts you there
Where things are hollow ♪</i>

48:13.840 --> 48:15.524
<i>♪ Fame ♪</i>

48:18.880 --> 48:20.689
<i>♪ Fame, it's not your brain ♪♪</i>

48:20.840 --> 48:23.605
All right. All right.

48:24.040 --> 48:26.361
Enough. Enough!

48:26.520 --> 48:28.045
Turn that off.

48:29.320 --> 48:30.481
Take that down.

48:31.880 --> 48:34.360
- Where do you want me to put it?
- I don't care.

48:34.520 --> 48:37.000
Throw it away.

48:39.800 --> 48:43.009
All of it, whole shelf.

48:53.880 --> 48:56.201
Horses are stupid.

48:59.120 --> 49:01.521
Horses eat and shit.

49:02.200 --> 49:04.123
That's all they do.

49:08.600 --> 49:10.602
It's very silly.

49:11.920 --> 49:14.127
It's all very silly.

49:18.120 --> 49:21.408
<i>Hove my mother very much,
but she...</i>

49:23.520 --> 49:24.851
She... It's...

49:27.120 --> 49:29.009
It's ridiculous.

49:30.560 --> 49:33.245
Sitting on an animal was more dignified.

49:36.200 --> 49:39.363
But I wanted to do what you're doing.

49:47.520 --> 49:49.443
Let's have those medals.

49:50.400 --> 49:52.164
Give me those.

49:52.960 --> 49:55.247
Give me those medals.

49:55.400 --> 50:00.201
I do not share my mother's affection
for horseflesh,

50:01.120 --> 50:02.929
I'll have you know.

50:05.360 --> 50:09.046
"Did your horse jump over the thing?"

50:11.080 --> 50:14.846
"Did you catch the fox, Mother?"

50:21.160 --> 50:22.810
Anyway,

50:23.960 --> 50:26.281
the proof is in the pudding.

50:28.920 --> 50:31.605
We caught the fox, didn't we?

50:31.760 --> 50:33.046
Yeah.
This is the fox.

50:33.200 --> 50:34.770
Yes, sir.

50:36.120 --> 50:39.886
I am going to put these in there.

51:02.640 --> 51:05.644
Gentlemen, I give you Mark Schultz,

51:05.800 --> 51:09.771
Foxcatcher world champion.
Yes. Good.

51:11.160 --> 51:12.605
Oh!

51:13.680 --> 51:15.125
Whoa, whoa, coach.

51:15.280 --> 51:17.282
- You all right?
- Get him up.

51:17.440 --> 51:20.523
- Coach, you all right?
- I think he had too much to drink.

51:21.720 --> 51:22.767
Oh!

51:25.160 --> 51:27.128
- Drive! Drive!
- Drive, drive!

51:27.280 --> 51:30.284
- Get on his other side.
- Get on him.

51:30.480 --> 51:32.881
- Push him.
- Come on. You got him.

51:33.040 --> 51:34.610
- What?
- The jig's up.

51:34.760 --> 51:38.446
Climb up on him. Come on. Come on.
Work him, work him, work him!

51:40.240 --> 51:41.765
Yes!

51:42.640 --> 51:44.529
Whoa!

51:45.360 --> 51:48.250
Don't let him drive you, Dan.
Don't let him drive you.

51:48.400 --> 51:51.563
Turn him. Come on, turn him. That's it.

51:51.720 --> 51:55.566
- You gotta turn him. Yes!
- Turn him. Turn him.

51:59.480 --> 52:00.720
Yes!

52:02.720 --> 52:04.802
- John!
- Johnny D!

52:04.960 --> 52:08.169
<i>John! John!</i> John!

52:08.320 --> 52:11.767
<i>John! John! John!</i>
Yeah!

52:26.640 --> 52:29.723
- Yo, Johnny D!
- Yeah, Johnny D!

52:35.400 --> 52:36.925
Yeah! Whoo!

52:52.040 --> 52:53.610
Mark.

53:00.480 --> 53:04.201
After practice, I want you to shower
and come talk to me, all right?

53:04.360 --> 53:06.124
Yeah. All right.

53:14.400 --> 53:17.483
Three hundred eighty-seven
days to Seoul, gentlemen.

53:18.880 --> 53:21.247
Let's have a good practice,
shall we?

53:43.320 --> 53:45.561
You don't have to do this.
You earned it.

53:45.720 --> 53:48.166
You've given me enough.
This is not necessary.

53:48.320 --> 53:51.085
Mark, Mark, you earned that.

53:54.760 --> 53:58.082
Thank you.
You're welcome, Mark.

54:05.320 --> 54:08.722
You're more than Dave Schultz's
little brother, Mark.

54:12.880 --> 54:14.325
Okay.

54:15.760 --> 54:17.762
Dave Schultz is a wonderful wrestler.

54:17.920 --> 54:21.447
He, I'm sure,
has been an inspiration to you.

54:21.600 --> 54:24.126
A mentor to you.

54:26.840 --> 54:29.320
But he will always be
your older brother.

54:29.480 --> 54:31.881
He will never let you

54:32.480 --> 54:35.131
be everything that you can be.

54:37.560 --> 54:42.361
Mark, you have been living
in your brother's shadow your entire life.

54:42.920 --> 54:46.561
It's time. It's your time now.

54:49.960 --> 54:51.928
I know what you mean.

54:52.800 --> 54:54.404
Do you?

55:01.560 --> 55:04.006
Because everything that I've done,

55:05.200 --> 55:07.009
I feel like...

55:07.960 --> 55:12.249
has somehow been credited to Dave.

55:14.640 --> 55:16.847
And, you know, I feel that...

55:17.880 --> 55:19.848
it's time for me to...

55:20.840 --> 55:23.366
distance myself from him.

55:24.280 --> 55:26.487
You know, become my own person.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.162
Without your brother...

55:32.800 --> 55:36.964
you can do anything
that you choose to set your mind to.

55:39.880 --> 55:42.645
Mr. du Pont,
I need you to know that I'm...

55:42.800 --> 55:46.725
I'm so grateful
for what you've done for me.

55:46.880 --> 55:49.042
Well, first of all,

55:49.240 --> 55:53.370
I don't want you to call me
"Mr. du Pont" or "sir" anymore.

55:53.520 --> 55:55.727
I consider us friends.

55:55.880 --> 56:01.444
And most of my friends
will call me "Eagle" or "Golden Eagle."

56:02.000 --> 56:05.209
So either of those will work.

56:05.360 --> 56:07.044
Okay.

56:09.160 --> 56:11.845
Or "John" or "Coach."

56:13.160 --> 56:16.323
All right. That's not a problem.

56:16.480 --> 56:17.970
Good.

56:23.120 --> 56:25.122
Good afternoon,
sir.

56:32.560 --> 56:36.007
M113, sir. APC.
I know what it is.

56:36.200 --> 56:38.123
Where's the gun?

56:38.280 --> 56:40.123
What gun, sir?

56:41.680 --> 56:46.163
Fifty-caliber machine gun.
Sir, there wasn't a machine gun ordered.

56:46.320 --> 56:49.244
It's supposed to be mounted
right there.

56:51.600 --> 56:53.887
There's no gun
on the order, sir.

56:58.760 --> 57:01.923
Sir, I just need a signature
to complete the order.

57:03.120 --> 57:04.963
Get my gun.

57:14.480 --> 57:16.164
Reed, McClaren,
let's off-load.

57:16.320 --> 57:19.529
It's supposed to come
with a .50-caliber machine gun.

57:19.680 --> 57:21.250
We'll get it.

57:23.120 --> 57:25.122
You hungry?
Yeah.

57:25.280 --> 57:27.647
Let's get something to eat.

57:28.520 --> 57:29.851
You snap him down.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.002
He'll posture up, that's your window.

57:32.160 --> 57:34.447
Shoot in and pull him over the top.

57:51.560 --> 57:52.971
Excellent.

57:53.120 --> 57:54.610
One more.

57:55.200 --> 57:56.770
Great.

57:56.920 --> 58:00.288
The oil looks really good
on you, Mark.

58:00.440 --> 58:03.649
Bow your arms a little bit.
Here we go.

58:04.240 --> 58:05.810
Excellent.

58:10.640 --> 58:13.530
Very good, and all right.
Very good, Mark.

58:22.360 --> 58:24.806
Your speeches, your kit.

58:24.960 --> 58:27.531
Do we know if my mother
has already arrived?

58:27.680 --> 58:29.489
She is en route, sir.

59:03.880 --> 59:05.405
The blazer looks good.

59:05.920 --> 59:07.081
Thank you, sir.

59:09.080 --> 59:11.731
I wrote down a few things for you to say.

59:13.880 --> 59:16.451
Don't be nervous.
You're gonna be great.

59:16.800 --> 59:18.768
Read it. Read it out loud.

59:19.720 --> 59:21.449
Okay. Right now?

59:21.880 --> 59:24.486
Get some practice.
Yes, sir.

59:26.360 --> 59:30.570
"Highly respected ornithologist,

59:30.720 --> 59:34.486
author, world explorer,

59:35.880 --> 59:37.962

59:38.760 --> 59:40.205
Philatelist.
Philatelist.

59:40.360 --> 59:44.001
Stamps.
Sta... Can we say "stamps"?

59:44.160 --> 59:46.527
No, philatelist.
Philatelist.

59:46.680 --> 59:49.160
Don't be intimidated by these people.

59:50.200 --> 59:52.043
How many people are gonna be there?

59:52.200 --> 59:54.123
About 400.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.647
Go ahead.

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:10.210
What is it?
It's cocaine.

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:16.330
Uh...
I'm not sure that's such a good idea.

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:19.323
Mark, it's just cocaine.

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:21.847
It's not going to kill you.

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:29.282
What am I...?
You're supposed to just...?

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:32.248
Take the vial,

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:34.761
tap some on the mirror,

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:38.970
take the straw,
just inhale it through your nose.

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:44.888
"Highly respected ornithologist,
author, world explorer,

philatelist and former pentathlete."

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:50.046
All of that?
All of it. Straight down.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:53.522
"Mr. du Pont will be making
his return to competitive sports

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:56.251

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:02.250
Did you hear how I was doing it?
It's just all one thought, Mark.

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:05.011
You got it.

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:08.009
Give that to me.

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:10.890
Okay.

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:16.122
"Highly respected ornithologist, author,

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:19.365

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:21.363
Philatelist.

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:24.285
Philanthropist.
Philanthrop... Which one...?

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:27.284
Ornithologist.
Which one do you want to come first?

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:30.805
Ornithologist, philatelist, philanthropist.

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:35.727
Okay, ornilo... Ornithologist,
philatelist, philanthropist.

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:38.321
Ornithologist, philatelist, philanthropist.

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:42.929
Ornilo... Ornithologist, philatelist...
Ornithologist, philatelist, philanthropist.

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.445
Ornilo... "Ornithogolist"...

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:47.888
Ornithologist, philatelist, philanthropist.
Ornithologist...

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:51.442
Ornithologist, philatelist, philanthropist.
Look at me.

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:54.291
Ornithologist, philatelist, philanthropist.

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:55.527
Again.

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:58.001
Ornithologist, philatelist, philanthropist.

01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:59.207
Again.

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:01.641
Ornithologist, philatelist, philanthropist.

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:02.847
Good.

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:16.761
Do I know you?

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:20.203
- Yes, John. How are you?
- Good to see you again.

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:22.089
This is Mark Schultz.
Hi.

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:25.164
Have you ever met an
Olympic gold medalist before?

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:28.449
Mark won the Olympic gold medal
for wrestling in 1984.

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:30.768
Ever seen an Olympic medalist before?

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:32.684
No, I don't think I have.

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.531
Mark. Mark.

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:40.763
This is Congressman Daniel.
Nice to meet you.

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:43.207
Bob.
Congressman Daniel... Bob or Daniel?

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:45.164
Bob, yes.
Bob, nice to meet you.

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:46.566
This is Mark Schultz.

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:49.929
Mark won an Olympic gold medal
in the 1984 Olympics.

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:51.963
Impressive.
Isn't that impressive?

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:53.764
Congratulations.
Thank you.

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:55.604
Quite a young man.

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:57.728
Very proud of him.
Nice meeting you.

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:11.611
I'm so proud to introduce my mentor.

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:15.526
He has the ability to look at me
and see where I am in life.

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:19.208
I feel his love for me as an athlete
and as a human being.

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:22.125
My mother and father were divorced
when I was <i>2</i>

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:24.931
And I spent a lifetime
looking for a father,

01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:28.846
and I found one in the Golden Eagle
of America, John du Pont.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.924
Mark Schultz. Thank you, son.

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:41.964
Hello, Mother.

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:46.770
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to read something.

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:50.091
"The liberties of our country,

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:53.528
the freedom of our civil constitution,

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:57.122
are worth defending at all hazards.

01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:00.682
And it is our duty to defend them
against all attacks..."

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:39.805
<i>Oh, hey. Hey, what's up?</i>
I miss you.

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:42.204
Yeah.
What you up to?

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:44.966
<i>Huh?
What you up to?</i>

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:47.405
<i>Nothing. Nothing.</i>

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:51.121
Are you working out? Getting ready?

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:55.723
<i>Yeah... No. I mean, well, I'm taking
a little bit of a break right now.</i>

01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:59.089
<i>Just resting up the body.
I'm gonna ramp it up, you know,</i>

01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:02.084
<i>when it gets closer to World... Trials.</i>

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:04.322
All right. How close?

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:07.245
<i>Hey, hold on. Hold on one second.
What?</i>

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:08.606
<i>What's happening?</i>

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:38.610
Hey!

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:40.125
Mark!

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:43.090

Huh?

01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:35.329
You are a good friend, Mark.

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:38.089
Thank you, John.

01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:45.967
I only had one real friend growing up.

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:49.441
Hugh Cherry. Hughby.

01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:54.449
He was the son
of my mother's chauffeur.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.206
Uh-huh.

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:09.289
When I was 16, I found out
that my mother had been paying him

01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:11.562
to be my friend.

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:19.368
Dave was my only friend growing up.

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:24.529
Yeah.

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:46.329
I thought we could put it
in the Rosemont case.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.608
It says John "Eagle" du Pont.
That's right.

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:01.531
First place?
Yes.

01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:04.808
You funded this.

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:07.404
Presumably.

01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:12.088
You can put it in the trophy room.

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:14.049
Thank you, Mother.

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:19.722
What are we going to do
about your train set?

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:21.684
My train set?

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:24.929
Well, Mr. Beck spoke to you
about this.

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:26.366
No.

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:28.010
Oh, I know he did.

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.844
I know he did.

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:34.087
You've never wanted
to give it away, but...

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:37.483
I don't care about my train set,
Mother. I don't care.

01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:43.047
Well, I think we'll...

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:48.764
We'll give it to the children's museum,
if they have room.

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:51.170
Do you agree?

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:55.166
I don't care what you do
with the train set.

01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:59.642
I don't care about trains.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.721
Mother, I am leading men.

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:05.969
I am training them.
I am teaching them.

01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:09.288
I am giving them...

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:11.280
a dream.

01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:14.091
And I am giving America...

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.890
hope.

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:19.210
Hope?

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:25.048
It doesn't matter.

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:28.362
I'm glad you have your trophy.

01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:30.488
It can go in the trophy room.

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:33.086
Not in the Rosemont case.

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:38.766
I don't like the sport of wrestling,
as you know.

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:42.762
It's a low sport.

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:48.646
And I don't like to see you being low.

01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:07.640
<i>And quickly Herrera shoots the leg.</i>

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:10.803
<i>And Herrera 's</i> a
<i>very good grappler here.</i>

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:15.686
<i>Oh, my. Elbows in
number, by Goodridge,</i>

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:17.490
<i>and that is it.</i>

01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:20.166
Albert wrestled with this guy at Pitt.

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:23.402
I think it's sad.

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:24.800
He was legit.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.048
He's probably getting paid a lot.

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:29.009
Look at his face.

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:31.640
<i>- That was short and sweet.
- It's destroyed.</i>

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:35.051
- It's John.
- It's John.

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:39.611
Hey, coach.
ls Mark in?

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:41.603
Yeah.
Right here, coach.

01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:43.125
What's up?

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:49.367
Why is there nobody in the gym?

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.606
What do you mean?
It's noon. Nobody in there.

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:57.929
Yeah, no,
I gave the boys the morning off.
We're gonna do a double tonight.

01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:00.361
Who's making these decisions?

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:03.125
I am.

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:09.766
I want your brother Dave here.

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:14.130
What are you talking about?

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:16.328
I want your brother Dave to come.

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:19.886
Um, that's not gonna happen.

01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:22.202
We've talked about that.

01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:30.284
Are you okay?

01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:36.247
You ungrateful ape.

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:42.685
I made such a mistake
bringing you here.

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:46.202
I'm getting Dave.

01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:49.011
I don't care how much it costs.

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:55.484
Shit.

01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:13.249
Hey.
Hi, guys.

01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:14.890
Yeah.

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:20.443
There he is.
He's coming. He's coming.

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:24.691
- John du Pont.
- Yeah.

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:28.448
Thanks.
Yeah.

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:22.688
Hey.

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:26.249
How you doing?

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:28.801
Good. I'm good.

01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:31.330
What's up?

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:35.087
I just... Just came in.
All the wrestlers were there
to meet me

01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:38.449
and you weren't there,
and I just thought I'd come up,

01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:40.489
make sure everything's okay.

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:42.847
No, I'm good.

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:45.448
Just concentrating.

01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:47.682
We got trials coming up.

01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:55.923
You okay, Mark?

01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:59.565
Yeah. I'm good.

01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:01.290
What's up?

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:06.722
You got my messages?

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:09.371
Mm-hm.

01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:12.250
Nancy and the kids are here.

01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:14.767
Yeah? How are they?
They're good.

01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:19.966
Why don't you come down and say hi.
Okay. I will. I'll see you.

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:30.644
Boom, down low.

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:33.849
This hand comes here,
this hand catches the ankle.

01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:37.921
Lay your back into the guy,
scoop with this leg, catch both knees,

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:41.482
put your arm through.
There's your cross ankle,
all right?

01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:43.130
Nice and tight.

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:45.800
Do it again, all right?

01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:48.008
So you're here, you're wrestling.

01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:52.406
If you get here
and you're loose like this,

01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:57.528
to make it nice and tight, what you
wanna do is drive the knees together

01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:01.685
with your hip and your elbow, and drop
your arm down or drop your chest.

01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:04.691
That'll make it nice and snug for you.

01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:07.281
You wanna keep
your outside leg away from him.

01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:10.364
Keep your leg away from him,
come up to your knee,

01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:14.047
turn your toe to the ceiling,
step him up.

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:18.284
Let's say he does reel over
with that outside ankle,

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:20.289
that's pretty much game over.

01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:23.484
I have a chance to make him
keep those feet...

01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:30.406
So from here, you pull this up
and you drive that.

01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:34.201
Outside shoulders from that,
and he pulls...

01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:42.888
Use your stomach.

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:48.723
Use your stomach.

01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:54.165
Good.

01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:56.245
Good set.

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:00.726
All right, pair up.

01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:02.885
Let's go, guys.

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:38.327
What's going on, Mark?

01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:56.887
There's that knee pick he likes to hit
from a fake shot or cross...

01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:00.971
Dave, I don't need your help.
I'm doing this on my own, okay?

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:13.883
You don't want my help?
Dave, what did I just say?!

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.163
Wanna tell me what's going on
with you and du Pont?

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:46.451
Okay.

01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:52.769
Handstands.

01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:55.446
Tuck and roll forward, boys.

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:05.207
Army crawl on this side.

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:16.284
Good.

01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:25.449
Bring it in.

01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:43.211
Move.

01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:46.328
Right there. Make some room.

01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:48.764
All the way over.

01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:04.689
In three days,

01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:09.209
several of you will be
traveling with me to Pensacola

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:12.250
to participate in the Olympic trials.

01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:20.404
When you leave the hallowed grounds
of this training facility...

01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:24.368
you will be in competition.

01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:27.366
You will be representing Foxcatcher.

01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:30.610
You will be representing
the United States.

01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:36.403
As a coach,

01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:42.960
I want you to be champions in sport...

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:46.648
and winners in life.

01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:49.969
And also...

01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:53.566
to be good citizens...

01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:56.045
for America.

01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:00.964
Garcia.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.968
A couple basics.

01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:15.167
This is one that generally
works for me quite well.

01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:17.649
Arm drag.

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:20.481
Right to left, left to right.

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:22.563
Rip it across.

01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:27.129
And as I do that,
you see this portion.

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:30.962
And I can move right in.

01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:33.284
Again.

01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:36.727
Right to left, left to right.

01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:39.207
Rip it across.

01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:41.203
And then in.

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:44.848
Got it?
Yeah.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.571
- Do we have that?
- Yes.

01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:50.883
All right, par terre.

01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:56.605
Down. Actually, I'll go down.

01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:59.010
- You do it.
- Okay.

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:00.446
Do it on me.

01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:02.921
So get underneath my rib.

01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:06.205
All right.

01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:17.322
The basic physics is to keep yourself
wide at the bottom.

01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:20.921
All right.

01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:24.845
He puts his knee under my hip,

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.241
and you see an opening here.

01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:28.731
So you shoot...

01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:37.725
Let's pair up.

01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:41.765
- Basics.
- All right.

01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:47.326
All right, let's pair
up and work on arm drags.

01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:49.323
Arm drags and gut wrenches.

01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:51.323
All right, let's do it, guys.

01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:54.920
Three days, three days.

01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:00.522
- Step forward.
- All right, name, weight.

01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:01.761
He's good.

01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:05.242
All right, you got about a...
Looks like about a half a kilo to go.

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:06.970
- Step forward.
- Name, weight?

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:08.360
- Thirty.
- He's good.

01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:10.329
- Next.
- Step forward.

01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:12.369
- Name? Weight?
- Let's see.

01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:15.040
That's about a half kilo to go.

01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:16.565
- You're good.
- Next.

01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:17.881
He's good.

01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:19.769
Step forward. Name, weight?

01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:22.002
Good. Next bastard's good.

01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:23.286
Next.

01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:24.521
Two kilos over.

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:26.489
- That looks good.
- You're good.

01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:27.926
- Next.
- Step forward.

01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:44.251
Next match:
Mark Schultz versus Rico Chiapparelli.

01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:18.120
One, blue.

01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:31.725
Best of three, Mark.
You'll get it back.

01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:34.805
Mark.

01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:30.131
You're not in this alone, man.

01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:33.361
I'm your brother and I love you.

01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:39.522
I am not gonna let you go down
like this.

01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:45.410
That's it.

01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:51.568
There's more in there.

01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:59.201
That's it, keep going, Mark.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.731
Twelve pounds over.
How much time we got?

01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:08.247
Ninety minutes.
Ninety minutes, okay.

01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:10.323
Come on,
there you go.

01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:14.568
That's it, drive it.

01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:20.050
Harder, Mark.

01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:21.565
That's it. Time.

01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:24.642
Okay. All right.

01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:30.887
Five, four, three, two, one.

01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:32.246
Time.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:36.322
Three, two, one.

01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:03.564
All right, buddy.

01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:05.405
Go.

01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:44.644
Circle.

01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:52.328
Hold your position, Mark.

01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:54.928
Ten seconds.

01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:56.485
Hold your position.

01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:03.805
All right. All right, Mark.

01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:22.645
Sheets can't be on the team.

01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:25.565
Mark Schultz
is on the Olympic team.

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:30.444
Get in there, Mark, you hear me?

01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:35.610
Okay, center red, center blue.

01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:49.770
Yeah!

01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:51.805
Two-thirty, Mark.

01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:42.771
Hey, Henry.
Dave. What can I do for you?

01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:48.285
Henry, John and I kind of had
an uncomfortable moment earlier

01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:52.081
and, you know,
I didn't see him at the finals.

01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:54.726
Was he even there?
No.

01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:57.850
Mr. du Pont flew home earlier today.

01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:02.124
Okay.

01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:07.167
Mr. du Pont's mother died.

01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:14.724
Oh, man.
That's really bad news.

01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:18.891
Excuse me, Dave.
All right. Thank you.

01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:03.328
Would you like us
to mount the weapon?

01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:04.686
Yes.
Gentlemen.

01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:58.448
You and me, buddy.

01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:09.731
How you doing? You sore?

01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:13.046
There you go.

01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:15.483
Open that stretch for me.

01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:20.209
It's John.

01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:27.049
Hey, John.

01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:33.325
I'm really sorry about your mother.
Oh, no, no, no. It's fine. It's fine.

01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:35.050
You okay? You sure?
Yes.

01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:39.762
David, we have a lot of work to do
in the next couple of months.

01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:44.200
And you're an integral part of that.
You understand?

01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:47.011
I understand.
I'm going to need you.

01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:50.881
And I will be relying on you

01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:55.125
All right.
to a great extent. I want,

01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:58.762
More than anything,
to win a gold medal.

01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:01.764
And we have someone
who could do that for us.

01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:03.843
We're gonna win
a gold medal, John.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:07.527
How are you feeling about that?
I feel very good about it.

01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:09.569
I am a little concerned

01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:14.123
that there are
some psychological issues

01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:16.569
that we need to take care of.

01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:20.008
He's gonna be in real good shape.
You're doing a great job.

01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:22.083
- Thank you, John.
- And I...

01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:27.363
I think that with you and I,
working in tandem,

01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:30.964
if we can't get him there,
no one can.

01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:34.484
All right. Get back.

01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:36.130
Okay.

01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:42.090
Mark?

01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:46.330
Mark?

01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:48.404
- You okay?
- Mark.

01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:50.241
He's okay.

01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:52.046
Come on, Mark.

01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:53.690
Good.

01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:27.043
<i>Coach du Pont has</i> a <i>vision.</i>

01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:29.402
He would like Foxcatcher

01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:31.961
to be designated and recognized

01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:34.049
as the official training site

01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:36.567
for U.S.A. Wrestling
and the Olympic team.

01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:43.681
Now, this means that the national team
would live here and train here.

01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:46.531
On top of funding this program,

01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:51.647
Coach du Pont would be willing
to make a donation to U.S.A. Wrestling

01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:54.724
of $500,000 per year.

01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:57.201
- That's fantastic.
- Yeah, that's really nice.

01:42:57.400 --> 01:42:59.801
Mr. du Pont,
thank you very much for...

01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:01.564
<i>The spirit of Foxcatcher.</i>

01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:07.405
<i>It is a philosophy
which began generations ago.</i>

01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:12.763
- Thank you.
<i>- It is more than just sport.</i>

01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:21.043
And coaching these young athletes,

01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:27.048
I am able to instill in them
the lessons that I have learned in life.

01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:32.650
Athletes need role models.

01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:38.009
Like anyone,
they need people to look up to.

01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:42.689
A coach is a father.

01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:46.166
A coach is a mentor.

01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:53.524
A coach has great power...

01:43:55.760 --> 01:44:00.243
great import on an athlete's life.

01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:05.009
We'll put you in a house
with another wrestler.

01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:07.731
Gym's a hundred yards from it.

01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:11.566
There's plenty of places
for the kids to run around.

01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:14.450
Hey, Mark, I'll just be...

01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:17.120
All right. I'll tell her you said hey.

01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:21.610
I'm waiting
to hear from you. Bye.

01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:24.564
Hey, buddy.

01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:28.008
Hey.
Warm up. I'll be out there in a minute.

01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:30.925
Yeah, I just...
I gotta make one more call.

01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:32.650
Look.

01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:37.642
I don't wanna be here.

01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:43.090
I called Coach Beacham at BYU.

01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:47.127
He said he'd take both of us.

01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:51.971
We don't got time
to make a big change like that.

01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:54.282
Okay, what about after Seoul?

01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:57.525
Mark...

01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:01.242
Look, I don't know
what's gonna happen in the future,

01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:04.967
but Nancy and I would like to try

01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:08.806
and make it work here.

01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:14.609
You and I both know
that I can't stay here.

01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:18.643
I know, Mark.

01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:34.411
Hey, do you remember
when we were kids?

01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:38.007
You remember how we lived?

01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:41.280
Moving all over the place?

01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:46.122
Never had any idea
where or how long
we were gonna be anywhere.

01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:48.681
Remember how that was
for us?

01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:51.081
Was it easy for us?

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:53.525
No.

01:45:55.840 --> 01:45:59.401
That's my responsibility
to my family, Mark.

01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:04.120
I know you understand that.

01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:11.051
Keep your head
in the game, Mark.

01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:13.884
Go on down.

01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:33.523
Hi, Dave, I'm Doc.

01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:36.001
Doc, Dave Schultz.
Nice to meet you.

01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:38.885
Have a seat in the chair here,
if you would.

01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:45.086
We're rolling.

01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:47.811
Let's talk a bit
about his philosophy as a coach.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:53.291
What is his philosophy
as the individual that's gonna
lead this team and you?

01:46:55.040 --> 01:47:01.571
Well, John's philosophy as a coach
is to let the wrestlers...

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.365
Um...

01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:08.446
Sorry.

01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:12.366
Is to, um, create an environment

01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:17.970
where, uh, the athlete
doesn't have many obstacles

01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:22.245
to get past to be great.

01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:26.447
Let's get pointed here. I...
I'm not doing what you want me to.

01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:29.080
Let's get pointed.
What are you looking for?

01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:31.402
You know what we're trying
to accomplish.

01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:36.964
We're making a documentary that shows
John is gonna be able to lead this team,

01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:41.250
lead you to levels of greatness
in wrestling we haven't seen before.

01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:45.281
And talk about that, but use
some of those terms that he likes,

01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:49.001
like "excellent" and "intensity"
and "domination."

01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:53.404
All right.

01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:57.002
Well, John du Pont...

01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:02.562
Say that again? I'm sorry.
Can you ask me that question again?

01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:07.847
John sees you as important to this.
You're the closing chapter to this thing.

01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:10.805
You're the end of it,
and you're his assistant coach.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.162
He sees himself as your mentor.

01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:16.529
I would like you
to just look at the camera

01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:21.322
and speak about John...

01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:23.846
as a mentor.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:25.445
And say what exactly?

01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:28.850
That he's your mentor.

01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:32.409
Can you do that?

01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:42.409
John du Pont...

01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:48.600
is kind of a mentor to me.

01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:55.730
Just look over here at the camera
and say it again.

01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:11.365
John du Pont is a mentor to me.

01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:22.286
I thought maybe it'd be a good idea
if we talked, kind of clear the air.

01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:26.122
I wanna make sure you guys
are clear that we expect

01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:31.241
that Mr. du Pont is gonna be
in Mark's corner throughout
the Olympic Games.

01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:38.410
Well, we can ask him
if that's okay, but first,

01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:41.962
I'd like to raise a few things
that are important to me.

01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:45.363
One, if I'm gonna...

01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:50.927
commit to staying on here
at Foxcatcher,

01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:55.287
I need to know
that Mark's gonna be taken care of.

01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:58.086
Well, taken care of how?

01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:02.882
So long as I'm at Foxcatcher,
Mark's gonna get paid.

01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:06.010
You want him to be paid
even if he's not here?

01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:08.726
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:15.688
Dave, you may be overestimating
your importance to Foxcatcher.

01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:19.447
Well, that may be so.

01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:24.561
We could test that,
but I'm here to say, John,

01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:28.924
I wanna continue
what we've started here at Foxcatcher.

01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:32.410
And it's important to me

01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:36.928
that I know that my brother
is gonna be supported.

01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:49.964
Thanks, John.

01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:54.370
Okay, you'll get your
deal, you'll get your demands,

01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:58.241
but this means that Mr. du Pont

01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:02.371
is gonna be seated in Mark's corner
throughout the Olympic Games.

01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:06.730
I wanna hear Mark agree
to that himself.

01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:07.371
Remember what
we went over today, Mark.

01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:12.611
You can't do this to yourself, buddy.
You can't do this to yourself.

01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:15.930
You can beat this guy, Mark.
You can beat him.

01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:46.400
Can I help you?

01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:51.011
- Everything okay?
- Can I help you?

01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:54.001
- Uh, yeah, we live here.
- Okay.

01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:57.801
There's a new security plan in place.
I'm gonna need to see some IDs.

01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:00.844
Sure.

01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:31.091
Hey, John, it's Sunday.
It's family time.

01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:34.088
Morning, John.
Say hi to John.

01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:36.404
Hi, John.

01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:42.609
It's Sunday.

01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:40.849
<i>Every athlete, no matter what sport,
needs structure,</i>

01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:43.363
<i>needs direction,</i>

01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:46.251
<i>and this is something
that a coach can offer.</i>

01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:51.249
<i>As a coach,
I hope to develop young athletes,</i>

01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:54.683
<i>not only in body, but in mind.</i>

01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:02.251
<i>I want you to be champions
in sport and winners in life.</i>

01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:07.085
<i>And also, good citizens of America.</i>

01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:10.280
<i>You will be representing Foxcatcher.</i>

01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:12.727
<i>You will be representing
the United States.</i>

01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:15.488
<i>The coach is there</i>

01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:18.561
<i>to help the athlete succeed</i>

01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:23.969
<i>in all the ways that
that athlete should be able to succeed.</i>

01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:25.645
<i>And in doing so</i>

01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:29.964
<i>that coach is able
to create a champion.</i>

01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:37.128
<i>My athletes look to me
as a brother, a mentor,</i>

01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:40.449
a <i>father and</i> a <i>leader.</i>

01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:42.921
<i>I spent my lifetime
looking for a father,</i>

01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:46.687
<i>and I have found one
in the Golden Eagle of America,</i>

01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:48.410
<i>John du Pont.</i>

01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:25.444
Wayne.

01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:31.486
Yes, sir?

01:58:31.640 --> 01:58:33.608
Is it snowing?

01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:36.049
No, it's not.

01:58:40.480 --> 01:58:42.528
Warm up my car.

01:58:42.920 --> 01:58:44.445
Yes, sir.

02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:29.686
Hey, John. What's happening?
Hey, whoa!

02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:31.888
No.
Do you have a problem with me?

02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:34.884
John. Don't, John.
No, John, I don't have a problem.

02:00:36.040 --> 02:00:37.724
Hey, John... Argh!

02:00:39.080 --> 02:00:40.241
John, no!

02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:41.970
Stop, John. Stop!

02:00:45.680 --> 02:00:47.603
John, no!

02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:51.842
- Freeze! Drop the gun!
- Drop it now!

02:05:23.440 --> 02:05:24.885
Mark.

02:05:25.520 --> 02:05:27.045
You're up.

02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:38.930
He is a jujitsu fighter,
standing 6 feet, 2 inches tall,

02:05:39.080 --> 02:05:42.050
weighing 225 pounds.

02:05:42.200 --> 02:05:44.328
From Moscow, Russia,

02:05:44.480 --> 02:05:49.646
