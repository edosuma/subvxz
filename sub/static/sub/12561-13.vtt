WEBVTT

00:07.835 --> 00:09.936
- What trip?
- To the Hamptons.

00:09.937 --> 00:11.771
What you did to us back then

00:11.772 --> 00:13.406
was gutless and pitiful.

00:13.407 --> 00:16.075
I understand that your life
went South when mom died.

00:16.076 --> 00:17.510
You didn't leave when mom died.

00:17.511 --> 00:19.345
You took off when she got sick.

00:19.346 --> 00:21.347
At some point, you're gonna
have to forgive him.

00:21.348 --> 00:23.850
At some point, you're gonna
have to realize I won't.

00:23.851 --> 00:26.119
That's the guy who donated
his kidney to his housekeeper?

00:26.120 --> 00:27.921
Divya,
that ring on your finger...

00:27.922 --> 00:29.856
I'm engaged.

00:29.857 --> 00:31.825
It's come to my attention
that your father is a criminal.

00:31.826 --> 00:34.260
He was prosecuted
and convicted.

00:34.261 --> 00:36.830
He became a confidential
informant against me.

00:39.133 --> 00:40.867
He's having a heart attack.
Call 911.

00:50.244 --> 00:52.545
This is the life.

00:55.850 --> 00:57.617
All right, well,
I don't know about you guys,

00:57.618 --> 00:59.752
but I am going in the water.

00:59.753 --> 01:02.021
- Have fun.
- Come on, Ev, let's go.

01:02.022 --> 01:03.456
I don't feel like it.

01:03.457 --> 01:05.592
- What's the matter, you scared?
- Yeah, I'm scared.

01:05.593 --> 01:06.926
- You scared?
- Yeah, I'm scared.

01:06.927 --> 01:08.828
Oh, sorry, your
little world's been destroyed.

01:08.829 --> 01:10.930
- Hey! Come here!
- Let's go, baby!

01:10.931 --> 01:12.065
Oh, you're not gonna get me.

01:12.066 --> 01:13.399
Don't go out too far!

01:14.468 --> 01:17.003
Boys, boys!

01:17.004 --> 01:18.972
Henry, not so deep!

01:24.678 --> 01:27.146
Damn it.

01:32.119 --> 01:33.753
Henry, Evan...

01:33.754 --> 01:35.521
Please...

01:35.522 --> 01:36.823
Please, come on out.

01:36.824 --> 01:39.359
Come on out.
Waves are coming in triplets.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.361
- They are?
- He's barely breathing.

01:41.362 --> 01:42.495
Pulse is weak and thready.

01:42.496 --> 01:45.465
Pushing 100 milligrams
Lidocaine.

01:45.466 --> 01:47.767
Henry, what are you
talking about?

01:51.005 --> 01:52.505
Damn it,
the Lidocaine didn't work.

01:52.506 --> 01:54.774
What does that mean?
Is he gonna be okay?

01:54.775 --> 01:57.777
- His b.P. Is 50 and dropping.
- What are you talking about?

01:57.778 --> 02:01.347
- He's in v-tach.

02:01.348 --> 02:03.182
Dad. Dad!

02:04.885 --> 02:07.487
He's in v-tach arrest.

02:12.559 --> 02:14.928
Clear!

02:14.929 --> 02:16.262
Charging.

02:18.732 --> 02:20.900
Clear.

02:25.572 --> 02:27.840
Dad. Dad...

02:27.841 --> 02:30.677
Hank...

02:30.678 --> 02:31.978
Hey.

02:38.953 --> 02:40.553
Divya.

02:40.554 --> 02:42.355
Adam.

02:42.356 --> 02:45.825
I thought you would have been
discharged by now.

02:45.826 --> 02:47.193
Man, it's a process.

02:47.194 --> 02:48.828
Um...
Adam...

02:48.829 --> 02:51.698
- I-I know. We should talk.
- No.

02:51.699 --> 02:55.134
I have to go.
It's an emergency.

02:55.135 --> 02:56.436
Oh, of course.

02:56.437 --> 02:58.604
We can talk later.

03:02.009 --> 03:05.778
Or perhaps...

03:05.779 --> 03:08.314
Perhaps it would be best
if we didn't.

03:10.084 --> 03:12.318
What happened happened...

03:12.319 --> 03:14.220
And, uh, talking about it
can't help

03:14.221 --> 03:15.922
that it never should have
happened at all.

03:17.858 --> 03:19.425
I'm sorry.

03:21.562 --> 03:22.929
The cath lab is prepped.

03:22.930 --> 03:24.597
Hank, this is Dr. Starnes,
the head of cardiology.

03:24.598 --> 03:26.532
Dr. Starnes,
Dr. Lawson.

03:26.533 --> 03:27.967
Hi.
So where are we?

03:27.968 --> 03:29.736
The patient was initially
in v-tach.

03:29.737 --> 03:32.105
I pushed 100 milligrams lido,
but his b.P. Crashed.

03:32.106 --> 03:34.340
He went into v-fib, so I shocked
him with 200 joules,

03:34.341 --> 03:35.942
and he reverted
to a sinus rhythm with ectopy.

03:35.943 --> 03:37.276
Are you his primary?

03:37.277 --> 03:39.379
I'm his son.

03:39.380 --> 03:40.480
Jesus.

03:40.481 --> 03:42.615
Get in here.
Yeah, let's go.

04:18.886 --> 04:20.053
He's stable.

04:30.130 --> 04:32.365
Can I touch him?

04:32.366 --> 04:33.433
No.

04:33.434 --> 04:35.635
Just... shh.

04:35.636 --> 04:36.936
Hi.

04:36.937 --> 04:38.004
Hi, dad.

04:38.005 --> 04:40.339
How you feeling, dad

04:40.340 --> 04:42.375
woozy...

04:42.376 --> 04:44.277
Tired...

04:44.278 --> 04:46.112
Mostly ashamed.

04:46.113 --> 04:48.281
Why?

04:48.282 --> 04:50.349
Because of all those bad
things that Boris said to me.

04:50.350 --> 04:51.851
And then before I got to tell

04:51.852 --> 04:56.255
my side of the story,
I almost die.

04:56.256 --> 04:57.623
It kills me.

04:57.624 --> 04:58.991
So to speak.

04:58.992 --> 05:00.793
We're glad it didn't.

05:00.794 --> 05:03.763
Man, I tell you,
it changed me, kiddos.

05:03.764 --> 05:05.498
I'm a new man.

05:05.499 --> 05:08.601
From now on,
I'm telling the truth.

05:08.602 --> 05:10.736
- That's great.
- I'm not kidding.

05:10.737 --> 05:12.305
No, I'm not kidding.
That's...

05:12.306 --> 05:16.075
really, that's terrific, dad.
I'll say.

05:16.076 --> 05:17.443
Let's hear it.

05:17.444 --> 05:19.245
But you just had
a heart attack.

05:19.246 --> 05:22.415
Undue stress should be avoided.

05:22.416 --> 05:26.085
Stress?
This won't be stressful.

05:26.086 --> 05:28.721
It's like lifting a weight
off my shoulders.

05:28.722 --> 05:32.558
If you feel up for it...

05:32.559 --> 05:34.060
We're listening.

05:34.061 --> 05:36.229
So...

05:36.230 --> 05:40.066
I'm thinking that this began...

05:40.067 --> 05:42.068
Yeah...

05:42.069 --> 05:46.239
I guess it all began...

05:46.240 --> 05:47.406
Yeah?

05:47.407 --> 05:50.510
I guess it...

05:50.511 --> 05:52.879
dad?
Dad, what's going...

05:55.649 --> 05:56.983
He's asleep, Ev.

05:56.984 --> 05:58.618
You guess that it started...
you said...

05:58.619 --> 06:00.386
- shh, shh, shh, shh.
- Dad...

06:00.387 --> 06:02.155
Ev! Come on, let's go.

06:25.086 --> 06:28.180
Sync by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

06:38.795 --> 06:41.997
All right, well,
if his status changes, call me.

06:41.998 --> 06:44.133
Thank you, Dr. Starnes.
Bye.

06:44.134 --> 06:45.834
Is he all right?
Whoa!

06:45.835 --> 06:47.002
Dude!
Sorry.

06:47.003 --> 06:48.270
I'm walking here.

06:48.271 --> 06:49.705
Sorry, I didn't see you.

06:49.706 --> 06:51.840
- Well, be careful, man.
- Have a good day.

06:51.841 --> 06:54.810
Was she drinking scotch?

06:54.811 --> 06:57.746
I don't know.
This just feels weird...

06:57.747 --> 06:59.815
going to work with dad
still in the hospital.

06:59.816 --> 07:01.350
I know.

07:01.351 --> 07:03.619
We were there all night.
We were there this morning.

07:03.620 --> 07:05.354
The doc said the best thing
for him right now is...

07:05.355 --> 07:06.755
to rest. It's true.

07:06.756 --> 07:08.157
- We can't rest for him.
- I know, but...

07:08.158 --> 07:10.259
sitting there
watching him sleep,

07:10.260 --> 07:11.894
that's not gonna help him
or anybody else.

07:11.895 --> 07:13.696
And hankmed's obligated
to this golf tournament

07:13.697 --> 07:14.897
for the next three days.

07:14.898 --> 07:17.199
So go, okay?
Go. Be obligatory.

07:17.200 --> 07:19.535
The word is actually
"obliging."

07:19.536 --> 07:21.003
Whatever.
We'll be with dad later.

07:21.004 --> 07:22.404
Right now you need to work,

07:22.405 --> 07:24.306
and I need to get
into dad's legal situation

07:24.307 --> 07:25.874
and find out whether or not
Boris wants to evict us.

07:25.875 --> 07:27.476
- Oh, oh, oh, I-I'd rather
you wait for me

07:27.477 --> 07:28.911
to deal with all that.

07:28.912 --> 07:30.145
Why, you don't want me
to smooth things over?

07:30.146 --> 07:33.749
You're more a ruffler
than a smoother.

07:33.750 --> 07:35.918
If you don't think
I can handle hankmed business,

07:35.919 --> 07:37.987
you should fire me.
Relax.

07:37.988 --> 07:39.355
You should fire me or,
preferably,

07:39.356 --> 07:40.656
ask for my resignation,
'cause it'll look better.

07:40.657 --> 07:42.091
Fine, you deal
with the dad stuff,

07:42.092 --> 07:43.525
but I will deal
with Boris, okay?

07:43.526 --> 07:44.793
Okay.

07:44.794 --> 07:46.395
- Not a word.
- I said, "okay."

07:46.396 --> 07:47.997
- Don't even wave at him.
- Not a word, not a wave.

07:47.998 --> 07:48.964
I won't even think about him.

07:48.965 --> 07:50.332
- Good
- Okay.

07:50.333 --> 07:52.868
Okay.
I'll see you later.

07:52.869 --> 07:55.304
You're thinking of him.
I'm... I'm trying not to.

07:57.941 --> 07:59.775
Yeah, his name
is Edward r. Lawson.

07:59.776 --> 08:02.244
Just Edward.
Yeah, just how it sounds.

08:03.947 --> 08:05.614
No, I'm not trying
to be smart, ma'am.

08:05.615 --> 08:07.182
I'm just not familiar
with any other way

08:07.183 --> 08:09.151
of spelling "Edward."

08:09.152 --> 08:10.919
No, I don't know
what court convicted him.

08:10.920 --> 08:13.188
That's why I'm calling you.

08:13.189 --> 08:15.324
Edward r. Lawson.

08:15.325 --> 08:16.759
E-d-w...
you know what...

08:16.760 --> 08:18.427
you know what, Virginia?
Forget it.

08:18.428 --> 08:20.896
God...

08:20.897 --> 08:25.200
Ladies and gentlemen,
your tax dollars at work.

09:07.911 --> 09:09.311
Hey, Boris.

09:11.314 --> 09:13.782
I understand your father
has stabilized.

09:13.783 --> 09:16.919
Yeah.

09:16.920 --> 09:18.687
Yeah, he's supposed
to be discharged tomorrow.

09:18.688 --> 09:20.389
That must be a great relief.

09:20.390 --> 09:22.791
It is, yeah.

09:24.294 --> 09:27.162
This is for your eyes only.

09:27.163 --> 09:28.931
Examine it, will you?

09:28.932 --> 09:30.532
I'll call you to discuss.

09:30.533 --> 09:32.968
You mean me and Hank.

09:32.969 --> 09:35.404
If I meant you and Hank,
I would have said so.

09:35.405 --> 09:36.905
Please don't miss my call.

09:36.906 --> 09:38.674
I won't.

09:38.675 --> 09:41.210
I'll even set up a special

09:41.211 --> 09:43.912
Kuester Von Jurgens-Ratenicz
ringtone.

09:52.122 --> 09:55.624
Dokken... Hoobastank...

09:55.625 --> 09:58.293
No, night ranger.

09:58.294 --> 10:02.898
Oh, yeah, this is so Boris.

10:17.046 --> 10:19.882
Ready...Whoa!

10:28.158 --> 10:29.591
Nice.

10:29.592 --> 10:31.160
Try to keep your club face
square at impact.

10:31.161 --> 10:34.863
With nothing on the tee,
it's hard to make any impact.

10:34.864 --> 10:37.132
Don't be so sure.

10:37.133 --> 10:39.668
Hi, I'm ja...
I know who you are.

10:39.669 --> 10:41.136
You're Jack O'Malley

10:41.137 --> 10:42.971
guilty.

10:42.972 --> 10:44.439
You'll be disappointed to learn

10:44.440 --> 10:45.808
I am the pro
you're playing with.

10:45.809 --> 10:48.076
Hardly.
I'm Jill Casey.

10:48.077 --> 10:49.211
Jack and Jill.

10:49.212 --> 10:51.079
Whoever is doing the pairing

10:51.080 --> 10:52.781
clearly has a sophisticated
sense of humor.

10:52.782 --> 10:53.982
Hi, there!

10:53.983 --> 10:55.951
We're the other half
of your foursome...

10:55.952 --> 10:57.386
nan noonan, my husband dick.

10:57.387 --> 10:58.587
- Hi.
- Hi, there.

10:58.588 --> 11:00.222
Jack O'Malley.
Jill Casey.

11:00.223 --> 11:02.191
Would you autograph my balls?

11:02.192 --> 11:05.794
Maybe when I get
to know you better.

11:05.795 --> 11:09.298
I'll get a pen.

11:09.299 --> 11:10.666
Isn't it exciting to be playing

11:10.667 --> 11:13.235
with such a famous golfer?
Oh, yeah.

11:13.236 --> 11:14.770
- Do you know O'Malley's story?
- Actually, I do.

11:14.771 --> 11:16.505
A couple years ago,
he just came out of nowhere.

11:16.506 --> 11:18.073
Yeah, I know.

11:18.074 --> 11:19.641
Leading the open by three
Stokes, one hole to play...

11:19.642 --> 11:21.476
- Mm-hmm.
I was watching.

11:21.477 --> 11:22.711
Then hooked his final tee shot
out of bounds

11:22.712 --> 11:24.046
and misses, poor thing.

11:24.047 --> 11:26.615
- Really?
- Could have been somebody.

11:26.616 --> 11:28.317
A thing like that would have
driven me to drink.

11:28.318 --> 11:30.519
There's a short trip.

11:30.520 --> 11:31.687
Scotch, Jill?

11:31.688 --> 11:34.256
It's 11:00 A.M.

11:34.257 --> 11:36.358
- I'll have another snort.
- Nice.

11:36.359 --> 11:38.493
Wow.

11:38.494 --> 11:41.396
Well, well, well,
look who plays golf.

11:41.397 --> 11:42.664
Well, when you work
with doctors,

11:42.665 --> 11:44.166
it's sort of
an occupational hazard.

11:44.167 --> 11:46.535
And the tournament
is benefiting the hospital.

11:46.536 --> 11:49.438
Uh, Jack, this is Hank.

11:49.439 --> 11:51.306
Hank, this is Jack O'Malley.

11:51.307 --> 11:52.474
He's the golf pro
that we're playing with.

11:52.475 --> 11:53.709
Oh, yeah.
Nice to meet you.

11:53.710 --> 11:55.711
I never shake
till after a tournament...

11:55.712 --> 11:57.346
superstition.
Nice to meet you.

11:57.347 --> 11:58.647
Oh, okay.
Well, uh, have fun.

11:58.648 --> 12:01.550
Hank, I don't play for fun.
I play to win.

12:01.551 --> 12:03.785
All right, then.

12:07.657 --> 12:09.992
What do you say the four of us
go out there

12:09.993 --> 12:13.695
and kick some
charity-based ass?

12:13.696 --> 12:16.098
Uh, Jack, are your fingers
okay there?

12:16.099 --> 12:18.600
I don't know, doc.

12:18.601 --> 12:21.270
You can watch my drive...

12:21.271 --> 12:23.272
And you tell me.

12:25.775 --> 12:27.809
Wow.

12:27.810 --> 12:29.111
Nice.

12:33.883 --> 12:37.219
Oh, I know it is, schmoopy.

12:37.220 --> 12:39.021
I can't wait to see you
tomorrow.

12:39.022 --> 12:42.991
Your body is like
a-a wonderland.

12:42.992 --> 12:44.393
Oh, yes, it is.

12:44.394 --> 12:46.261
Bye for now.

12:46.262 --> 12:47.863
That was miss Newberg.

12:47.864 --> 12:50.032
Oh, really? I thought
it was your proctologist.

12:50.033 --> 12:51.333
Stop, stop, stop!

12:51.334 --> 12:52.501
They have this fancy
cappuccino machine.

12:52.502 --> 12:54.269
I'd like a, uh...
a double shot, please.

12:54.270 --> 12:56.872
You want some?
No, I don't want some.

12:56.873 --> 12:59.007
Dad, has Dr. Starnes explained
the lifestyle changes

12:59.008 --> 13:00.642
you need to make
once you're discharged?

13:00.643 --> 13:02.044
Lifestyle changes? No.

13:02.045 --> 13:03.512
Can we finish old business

13:03.513 --> 13:05.080
before we start
with new business?

13:05.081 --> 13:06.281
Hold on for a second.

13:06.282 --> 13:07.816
What do you mean
"lifestyle changes"?

13:07.817 --> 13:10.018
Diet, exercise, a daily statin

13:10.019 --> 13:12.287
or other medication to help
lower your cholesterol.

13:12.288 --> 13:13.555
The truth about everything...
remember that?

13:13.556 --> 13:14.856
Will you hold on for a minute?

13:14.857 --> 13:16.725
Do these have
any sexual side effects?

13:16.726 --> 13:18.727
Um, sometimes.

13:18.728 --> 13:20.729
But you won't know
for another three to four weeks,

13:20.730 --> 13:22.831
once you're cleared
to resume normal activities.

13:22.832 --> 13:25.634
Shut the front door.
Three to four weeks?

13:25.635 --> 13:27.102
Dad, you invested in companies

13:27.103 --> 13:28.870
that didn't exist...
okay, let's start there.

13:28.871 --> 13:30.639
- Allegedly didn't exist.
- Yeah.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.307
And you were convicted.

13:32.308 --> 13:34.676
I had a little legal trouble.

13:34.677 --> 13:35.844
With... with the s.E.C.

13:35.845 --> 13:37.145
- You want to tell the story?
- No.

13:37.146 --> 13:39.348
Look, when a man makes
a mistake,

13:39.349 --> 13:40.615
does that entitle
the government

13:40.616 --> 13:42.284
to take everything he owns?

13:42.285 --> 13:44.820
In north Korea, maybe,
but not in this country.

13:44.821 --> 13:48.924
Look, the money that I moved
in and out of hankmed

13:48.925 --> 13:52.961
was merely to preserve
the very little I had left.

13:52.962 --> 13:54.930
And you made us look suspicious

13:54.931 --> 13:56.398
by doing that, dad.

13:56.399 --> 13:58.333
You... you risked everything
we've built here.

13:58.334 --> 13:59.868
Evan, maybe now's not the time
to get into...

13:59.869 --> 14:01.770
you know what?
It would have been just fine.

14:01.771 --> 14:03.105
And then I signed
for a box of drugs

14:03.106 --> 14:05.173
that was bound for Cuba,
and kaboom!

14:05.174 --> 14:06.742
I was back
in the crosshairs again.

14:06.743 --> 14:09.611
They wanted to know everything.
I knew nothing.

14:09.612 --> 14:12.647
So I offered to help them
figure out

14:12.648 --> 14:15.017
whether Boris was
a good guy or a bad guy.

14:15.018 --> 14:16.118
That's it.

14:16.119 --> 14:18.754
You're going to jail, dad.

14:18.755 --> 14:20.822
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are. You are.

14:20.823 --> 14:22.324
Hey, you know what?
Talk to my lawyer and ask him.

14:22.325 --> 14:24.359
Give me his number.
I'd love to talk to him.

14:24.360 --> 14:26.028
Don't get fresh with me.

14:26.029 --> 14:27.696
Okay, everyone just calm down.

14:27.697 --> 14:29.131
What's going on here?
I'm sorry.

14:29.132 --> 14:30.332
I'm sorry.
Okay, deep breaths.

14:30.333 --> 14:31.700
Deep breaths.

14:31.701 --> 14:35.704
Evan, let's get him healthy.
Then you can kill him.

14:35.705 --> 14:37.105
I have a good idea.
Let's get out of here.

14:37.106 --> 14:38.807
Great idea.
Let's do that.

14:38.808 --> 14:40.609
I really feel like
some eggs Benedict.

14:40.610 --> 14:42.244
What did I just...
you can't have that.

14:42.245 --> 14:43.512
Right, right, right,
right, right.

14:43.513 --> 14:44.946
Remember, lifestyle changes.

14:44.947 --> 14:46.415
I have to take the drugs first.

14:46.416 --> 14:47.816
No, actually,
that's not it either.

14:47.817 --> 14:49.317
You just told me
they lower my cholesterol.

14:49.318 --> 14:51.086
I'm not getting this.
No, you're not getting it.

14:51.087 --> 14:52.487
You're not getting it at all.

14:57.393 --> 14:59.594
Try not to open your hips
so much when you follow through.

14:59.595 --> 15:02.964
So is this the part
where you cozy up behind me

15:02.965 --> 15:04.433
and show me how to swing?

15:04.434 --> 15:06.535
No, that move's strictly
for the amateurs.

15:12.041 --> 15:14.876
Come on.
What was that?

15:14.877 --> 15:16.812
That...

15:16.813 --> 15:18.947
Was a totally
acceptable golf shot.

15:18.948 --> 15:20.315
- Acceptable?
- Mm-hmm.

15:20.316 --> 15:22.117
Yay.

15:22.118 --> 15:24.152
Do not be so hard on yourself.

15:24.153 --> 15:25.821
Did you take a look
at the standings this morning?

15:25.822 --> 15:27.789
We are in the hunt.
We are right in the hunt.

15:27.790 --> 15:30.792
No, no, you...
you're doing great.

15:30.793 --> 15:32.727
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:32.728 --> 15:34.329
Do you put the flower in it
or on the outside of it?

15:34.330 --> 15:35.397
Do you know?

15:35.398 --> 15:38.200
We just got to play it safe

15:38.201 --> 15:40.001
and avoid catastrophe.
Aah!

15:49.045 --> 15:50.912
Hey.
Hey, are you okay?

15:50.913 --> 15:53.181
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

15:53.182 --> 15:55.317
I just...
a few cuts and scrapes.

15:55.318 --> 15:57.018
That was dramatic.

15:57.019 --> 15:59.788
Oh, Jack, you're bleeding.

15:59.789 --> 16:01.356
Yeah, on your head.
Come on.

16:05.042 --> 16:06.209
Minor laceration
at the hairline.

16:06.210 --> 16:07.544
Did you lose consciousness?
No.

16:07.545 --> 16:09.546
Only my pride was hurt.

16:09.547 --> 16:10.814
Okay. What's this?

16:10.815 --> 16:12.349
You don't know what that is?

16:12.350 --> 16:13.583
No, I do.
It's just...

16:13.584 --> 16:14.985
- a pen.
- Thank you.

16:14.986 --> 16:16.519
Spell "world" backwards.

16:16.520 --> 16:17.554
Why, you dyslexic?

16:17.555 --> 16:19.456
- No, I'm not.
- D-l-r-o-w.

16:19.457 --> 16:21.625
Mental status normal,
relatively speaking.

16:23.094 --> 16:24.461
All things considered,
not so bad.

16:24.462 --> 16:27.364
Yeah. Good thing
I landed next to the branch

16:27.365 --> 16:28.465
and not on it.

16:28.466 --> 16:30.900
So, uh, how'd this happen?

16:30.901 --> 16:34.437
They were coming right at us,
and I just lost control.

16:34.438 --> 16:35.839
Sweaty hands, I guess.

16:35.840 --> 16:37.540
I make you that nervous, huh?

16:37.541 --> 16:39.309
Okay. Would you walk
with me a sec?

16:39.310 --> 16:41.211
I just want to make sure
your balance is okay.

16:41.212 --> 16:42.379
Yeah.

16:42.380 --> 16:45.148
Thanks.
Um, so...

16:45.149 --> 16:47.684
I don't mean to pry,
but I think your hands have

16:47.685 --> 16:49.519
bigger problems than sweat.

16:49.520 --> 16:52.689
The, uh... the curvature of
your pinkie and ring fingers...

16:52.690 --> 16:54.224
I think you may have
a condition called...

16:54.225 --> 16:55.792
dupuytren's contracture...

16:55.793 --> 16:57.127
a progressive thickening
of the connective tissue

16:57.128 --> 16:59.329
in my hand.
Yeah. Exactly.

16:59.330 --> 17:01.298
I've been living with that
for about a year and a half.

17:01.299 --> 17:02.832
So have you looked
into radiotherapy,

17:02.833 --> 17:04.000
needle aponeurotomy?

17:04.001 --> 17:05.969
Or the series
of 12 surgeries I could have.

17:05.970 --> 17:08.471
Yes, I have.
And?

17:08.472 --> 17:10.839
Look, doc, I might be a golfer,

17:10.840 --> 17:13.009
but I don't make
Tiger Woods money...

17:13.010 --> 17:15.111
Or his caddie's money
or his caddie's caddie's money.

17:15.112 --> 17:17.213
Look, doc,
I'm a minor-leaguer.

17:17.214 --> 17:18.815
Yeah, minor or not,
you still need your hands

17:18.816 --> 17:20.317
to golf, right?
Yeah, I do.

17:20.318 --> 17:21.818
But I would be sidelined
way too long.

17:21.819 --> 17:23.353
I would lose the few sponsors
that I have.

17:23.354 --> 17:24.921
I might never be able
to come back.

17:24.922 --> 17:27.057
Or you'd come back stronger.
You don't know.

17:27.058 --> 17:28.892
I don't know,
and that's what scares me.

17:28.893 --> 17:30.260
I don't...

17:30.261 --> 17:32.329
I don't have anything else
to fall back on.

17:32.330 --> 17:34.597
So the way I see it,

17:34.598 --> 17:37.334
I just got to make the most
of the time I have left.

17:37.335 --> 17:39.502
Great. But one of these
could help extend that time.

17:39.503 --> 17:43.073
You know what people
started calling me

17:43.074 --> 17:44.941
after I blew the final hole
at the open?

17:44.942 --> 17:46.543
No.

17:46.544 --> 17:49.279
Captain hook.

17:51.849 --> 17:54.184
Ironic.

18:05.463 --> 18:08.998
Thank you so much.

18:08.999 --> 18:11.634
Okay, I leave
for London Thursday.

18:11.635 --> 18:12.802
I return Monday.

18:12.803 --> 18:14.003
I have juggled the schedule,

18:14.004 --> 18:15.405
so those should be
relatively light days.

18:15.406 --> 18:18.007
Divya, you're moving
to London in, like, a month.

18:18.008 --> 18:19.976
You really need to go there
next weekend too?

18:19.977 --> 18:22.379
Of course, divya.
It's fine. Come here.

18:22.380 --> 18:24.280
Take a look at this.

18:24.281 --> 18:25.849
Oh, for your golfes hand.

18:25.850 --> 18:27.550
Yeah, let's give them
a call, okay?

18:27.551 --> 18:30.120
Sure. I'm on it.

18:32.790 --> 18:36.059
Hank, I think I just located
dad's attorney.

18:36.060 --> 18:37.761
Wait, is this dad's phone?

18:37.762 --> 18:40.230
Yep. I stole it...Briefly,
just to find his lawyer.

18:40.231 --> 18:42.065
All right. Well, great.

18:45.136 --> 18:46.369
That's it?

18:46.370 --> 18:48.571
I got a work thing here, okay?

18:48.572 --> 18:50.840
Okay.

18:50.841 --> 18:53.276
Forgive me for thinking
our father,

18:53.277 --> 18:54.711
who just had a heart attack

18:54.712 --> 18:56.446
and is most likely headed
for federal prison,

18:56.447 --> 18:58.415
might interest you
more than a work thing.

18:58.416 --> 18:59.849
What do you want me to do, ev?

18:59.850 --> 19:01.184
Maybe care a little bit.

19:01.185 --> 19:02.952
I do care, okay?

19:02.953 --> 19:04.854
That's a funny way
of showing it.

19:04.855 --> 19:08.992
What do you want me
to do, obsess?

19:08.993 --> 19:11.494
I see what this is.

19:11.495 --> 19:12.962
This is you gloating.

19:12.963 --> 19:15.432
What? What are you...
what are you talking about?

19:15.433 --> 19:17.534
You've been suspicious
of dad since day one.

19:17.535 --> 19:18.868
I always said you were wrong.

19:18.869 --> 19:20.670
But you weren't wrong.
You were right.

19:20.671 --> 19:22.272
So now this is you
sitting there

19:22.273 --> 19:23.673
being all...

19:23.674 --> 19:24.741
Right.

19:24.742 --> 19:28.178
I am not gloating.
It's just...

19:28.179 --> 19:29.646
I don't need to know
the gory details

19:29.647 --> 19:33.183
of how wrong you were
or I was or he is.

19:33.184 --> 19:35.118
It won't fix anything,
and it'll only make me angry.

19:35.119 --> 19:38.388
And I am tired of being angry.

19:38.389 --> 19:40.223
See, this right here...
this thing...

19:40.224 --> 19:42.125
This might let me fix
a guy's hands.

19:42.126 --> 19:44.027
I like problems
I can fix, Evan.

19:44.028 --> 19:45.094
It's why I'm a doctor.

19:45.095 --> 19:46.663
Well, I'm not a doctor?

19:46.664 --> 19:48.264
I want the details...

19:48.265 --> 19:50.166
Just in case there are
any land mines out there

19:50.167 --> 19:52.135
we haven't stepped on
yet, okay?

19:55.072 --> 19:57.307
Fine.

19:57.308 --> 20:00.577
Just do yourself a favor
and try not to get hurt, okay?

20:00.578 --> 20:02.946
Thank you.

20:06.917 --> 20:08.284
Listen, you didn't hear it
from me,

20:08.285 --> 20:11.988
but, um, your family,
your father trusts you.

20:11.989 --> 20:13.256
And I'm gonna assume
that what I say

20:13.257 --> 20:15.492
stays between us, okay?
Absolutely.

20:15.493 --> 20:16.893
What you dug up is accurate.

20:16.894 --> 20:18.795
Your father got caught up in
a trading scheme in the spring.

20:18.796 --> 20:19.929
All right.
And he was convicted?

20:19.930 --> 20:21.264
Maybe he deserved it.

20:21.265 --> 20:22.799
Maybe he just got
the wrong judge

20:22.800 --> 20:24.267
in the wrong mood, you know?

20:24.268 --> 20:26.135
But, uh, yeah.

20:26.136 --> 20:28.104
And this happened
before the summer, right?

20:28.105 --> 20:29.772
Before he cleaned out
hankmed's bank account.

20:29.773 --> 20:32.342
Yeah. He was in a bad place
when he got out here.

20:32.343 --> 20:34.978
He didn't have any money,
didn't know where to turn.

20:34.979 --> 20:37.480
- Right.
- He was, uh...

20:37.481 --> 20:40.717
he was set to flee the state
in order to avoid sentencing.

20:40.718 --> 20:43.386
What?
He was going on the lam?

20:43.387 --> 20:44.687
Until he went to the Hamptons,

20:44.688 --> 20:47.257
at which point he opted
to work with the feds

20:47.258 --> 20:49.425
and try to make his sentence
go away.

20:49.426 --> 20:50.960
Why?
Because of us?

20:50.961 --> 20:53.530
He said he had a shot
at fixing things with his sons,

20:53.531 --> 20:55.532
that, uh...

20:55.533 --> 20:57.734
That you boys were
the most important thing to him.

20:57.735 --> 21:01.337
Whew.
Okay, um...

21:01.338 --> 21:03.640
So his sentencing hearing...

21:03.641 --> 21:06.476
He... he still has a chance
of probation, right?

21:06.477 --> 21:09.112
Or maybe community service
or something?

21:09.113 --> 21:11.748
I wouldn't count on it, son.

21:22.232 --> 21:25.134
Well, I see you picking
at your food, miss Casey,

21:25.135 --> 21:26.569
but I don't see you eating it.

21:26.570 --> 21:27.804
You're gonna need
your strength out there.

21:27.805 --> 21:29.405
Well, you know what?
I'm not hungry.

21:29.406 --> 21:30.773
I think I might be nervous.
Hey, guys.

21:30.774 --> 21:32.075
Hey, doc.
You want to join us?

21:32.076 --> 21:33.543
- Um...
- You know what?

21:33.544 --> 21:34.877
We have no time. We have to go
to the driving range.

21:34.878 --> 21:36.212
- Ah.
- We're only two strokes behind.

21:36.213 --> 21:38.047
We're in the hunt.

21:38.048 --> 21:39.782
- We take golf very seriously.
- Okay.

21:39.783 --> 21:41.317
And I like to win.

21:41.318 --> 21:44.120
But, Hank, I could really
use your help.

21:44.121 --> 21:46.556
If you like to win and you
need my help, you're in trouble.

21:46.557 --> 21:48.124
No, it's just I haven't played
golf in a while,

21:48.125 --> 21:49.626
and after two rounds
in two days,

21:49.627 --> 21:51.127
my back is really
stiffening up.

21:51.128 --> 21:52.528
How about you start
with two advil?

21:52.529 --> 21:53.630
- Deal.
- Okay.

21:53.631 --> 21:54.897
All right, eat quick.

21:54.898 --> 21:55.932
I'm gonna get the check,
all right?

21:55.933 --> 21:58.668
- Uh, real... you don't...
- No, I got it.

21:58.669 --> 22:01.270
Yeah, just let the girl pay.

22:01.271 --> 22:05.074
Competitive, beautiful,
buys me breakfast...

22:05.075 --> 22:06.409
I like this girl.

22:06.410 --> 22:09.145
- Uh-huh. So I did
some reading up on dupuytren's.

22:09.146 --> 22:10.480
Don't waste your time.

22:10.481 --> 22:12.749
And while the surgeries
you mentioned are one way to go,

22:12.750 --> 22:14.283
there's a brand-new drug
on the market.

22:14.284 --> 22:15.318
Waste your time.

22:15.319 --> 22:17.153
Your doctor might not know,

22:17.154 --> 22:18.855
'cause it was just approved
by the fda.

22:18.856 --> 22:20.890
I haven't seen a doctor
in a while.

22:20.891 --> 22:22.191
Okay, well,
it's an injection in your hand

22:22.192 --> 22:23.726
that basically melts
the lesions

22:23.727 --> 22:25.862
that cause the ligaments
in your fingers to tighten.

22:25.863 --> 22:27.563
No surgery?

22:27.564 --> 22:30.099
No surgery, but no guarantees.

22:30.100 --> 22:32.201
Nothing's guaranteed,
but that's great.

22:32.202 --> 22:33.803
Thanks, doc.
I'll... I'll check it out soon.

22:33.804 --> 22:36.239
How about now?

22:36.240 --> 22:38.741
It could take a few hours
to see results.

22:38.742 --> 22:40.810
Okay, this may pinch a little.

22:40.811 --> 22:43.513
Pinch away. I've tried
everything... nothing works.

22:43.514 --> 22:45.615
Life doesn't offer
too many mulligans.

22:45.616 --> 22:47.517
- Uh, mulligans?
- What kind of doctor are you?

22:47.518 --> 22:49.185
You too busy treating
the patients

22:49.186 --> 22:50.586
to learn your golf terms?

22:50.587 --> 22:53.589
Mulligan... fresh start,
do-over, second chance.

22:53.590 --> 22:56.693
I guess we could all use
a mulligan now and then.

22:58.529 --> 23:01.798
Okay...

23:01.799 --> 23:03.966
You are all set, my friend.

23:11.275 --> 23:12.675
- Whoo!
- Nice shot.

23:12.676 --> 23:13.910
Nice out, Casey.

23:13.911 --> 23:17.547
Oh, man.
I hit it fat.

23:17.548 --> 23:19.248
Oh, you knocked the back
out of it.

23:19.249 --> 23:20.483
That'll work.

23:20.484 --> 23:22.318
Hey, everything okay?
You called.

23:22.319 --> 23:26.589
I did.
Guys, I'll meet you down there.

23:26.590 --> 23:30.326
Hank, I need a shot
of cortisone a.S.A.P.

23:30.327 --> 23:32.128
And you know what?
Anything else

23:32.129 --> 23:33.262
you have in that bag of yours.

23:33.263 --> 23:35.832
My back is in spasm.
I can taste victory.

23:35.833 --> 23:37.366
Well, if everything hurts
that much,

23:37.367 --> 23:40.269
stop tasting and get some rest
and some ice.

23:40.270 --> 23:41.871
Are you suggesting I quit?

23:41.872 --> 23:43.639
I'm suggesting
you protect your body.

23:43.640 --> 23:45.408
You were thrown
from a golf cart yesterday.

23:45.409 --> 23:47.276
But, Hank, I'm nine holes away.

23:47.277 --> 23:48.778
Did you know it's bad form
to injure yourself

23:48.779 --> 23:50.780
at a charity tournament
benefiting a hospital?

23:50.781 --> 23:54.250
Hank, I want the win,
and I want that trophy.

23:54.251 --> 23:55.585
Okay.

23:55.586 --> 23:57.620
Not to mention...
I have a partner,

23:57.621 --> 23:59.222
and I don't want
to let him down.

23:59.223 --> 24:01.791
Yeah, I'm not finding
that argument very persuasive.

24:01.792 --> 24:02.959
You jealous?

24:02.960 --> 24:05.928
Yeah. That you prefer golf
to your health.

24:05.929 --> 24:07.530
No, I'm not jealous.
Sit down.

24:10.334 --> 24:11.901
How about we give you
a tens unit?

24:11.902 --> 24:13.770
Oh, you want to give me
electrical nerve stimulation?

24:13.771 --> 24:15.938
All right.
I want you to take it easy.

24:15.939 --> 24:18.341
<i>But since you're clearly gunning
for the cover of golf digest,</i>

24:18.342 --> 24:21.677
I'll settle
for just making you feel better.

24:21.678 --> 24:24.447
And in the future, sir,
anger management may help...

24:24.448 --> 24:26.582
both for you
and your five iron.

24:26.583 --> 24:28.584
Thank you.

24:33.891 --> 24:36.058
I'm sorry to just appear
like this,

24:36.059 --> 24:40.062
but I got worried when you
ignored the texts I sent you.

24:40.063 --> 24:42.398
Worried that I wasn't well?

24:42.399 --> 24:44.233
Worried that you
weren't returning my texts.

24:44.234 --> 24:46.202
Please, hear me out.
Adam...

24:46.203 --> 24:47.403
I'll... I'll talk fast.

24:49.473 --> 24:51.474
You're engaged,
and I knew that.

24:51.475 --> 24:53.409
And I never should have put you
in the position that I did.

24:53.410 --> 24:55.478
- Adam...
- Still talking.

24:55.479 --> 24:57.113
So I'm sorry for that.

24:57.114 --> 24:58.781
But I'm also...
I'm not sorry,

24:58.782 --> 25:01.117
because when we kissed,
I don't know...

25:01.118 --> 25:03.052
it just...
it felt good...

25:03.053 --> 25:05.288
And right.
Please don't.

25:05.289 --> 25:07.056
Look, if I'm wrong
and you didn't feel anything,

25:07.057 --> 25:08.691
tell me.

25:08.692 --> 25:11.260
And if you want me
to stop texting you...

25:11.261 --> 25:13.563
And stop showing up
at random golf tournaments...

25:13.564 --> 25:17.967
Just say so, and you'll never
see me again.

25:20.237 --> 25:22.839
When we kissed...

25:22.840 --> 25:26.509
I felt nothing except regret.

25:28.212 --> 25:29.679
I'm sorry.

25:44.294 --> 25:46.462
Cup right, all right.

25:46.463 --> 25:48.631
There's about a foot break.

25:48.632 --> 25:50.099
You got it?
Yeah.

25:50.100 --> 25:52.835
Okay. Piece of cake.

25:52.836 --> 25:54.036
Ms. Casey, you sink
this little putt,

25:54.037 --> 25:56.772
our team goes ahead
with one hole to play.

25:56.773 --> 25:58.774
Yeah, no pressure, huh?

25:58.775 --> 26:01.544
Hey, champions thrive
in the clutch.

26:01.545 --> 26:03.112
Or so they tell me.

26:27.187 --> 26:28.687
Her back's been bothering her.

26:28.688 --> 26:30.523
- And her stomach.
- One more time.

26:33.527 --> 26:35.761
You know what, guys?

26:35.762 --> 26:37.263
I am feeling much better.

26:37.264 --> 26:38.797
Yeah.

26:38.798 --> 26:41.300
Yeah, maybe just some more
of that electrical stimulation.

26:41.301 --> 26:43.502
It doesn't treat nausea.

26:43.503 --> 26:45.137
Well, it's probably
just a stomach bug.

26:45.138 --> 26:46.939
Really, guys, I'm... I'm fine.
Sit down.

26:46.940 --> 26:48.574
Jill, we're not
golfing anymore.

26:48.575 --> 26:50.409
Yeah, I ink this is
more than just a strained back.

26:50.410 --> 26:52.044
You may have suffered
a splenic tear

26:52.045 --> 26:53.379
when you hit the ground
after the accident.

26:53.380 --> 26:54.680
We need to take you
back to the tent

26:54.681 --> 26:56.115
and check
your hemoglobin levels.

26:56.116 --> 26:58.484
Well, doctor, my spleen's
been bothering me too.

26:58.485 --> 26:59.752
It has?

26:59.753 --> 27:01.453
Well, how can you tell?

27:01.454 --> 27:02.855
I was in the accident as well.

27:02.856 --> 27:04.823
Yeah, but, honey,
she hit the ground.

27:04.824 --> 27:06.892
We just went through
some leaves and webs.

27:06.893 --> 27:09.428
Your spleen is splendid.

27:09.429 --> 27:10.996
Um, Jill...

27:10.997 --> 27:13.732
Show me exactly where you
feel the pain on your back.

27:13.733 --> 27:15.201
It's just under
my shoulder blades.

27:15.202 --> 27:17.536
Well, you were right
about the bug,

27:17.537 --> 27:19.772
only it wasn't in your stomach.

27:19.773 --> 27:22.208
What is it?

27:23.443 --> 27:25.077
So this should help
with the pain.

27:25.078 --> 27:27.313
This'll counteract the toxin.

27:27.314 --> 27:30.249
I can't believe I didn't feel
a spider biting me.

27:30.250 --> 27:32.685
Well, you were thrown
out of a golf cart.

27:32.686 --> 27:34.954
Your mind
may have been elsewhere.

27:34.955 --> 27:36.989
A black widow bite isn't
so bad if you catch it early.

27:36.990 --> 27:39.992
You may feel groggy
or even a little loopy.

27:39.993 --> 27:42.661
Jack, I'm really sorry
about this.

27:42.662 --> 27:44.163
What are you apologizing for?

27:44.164 --> 27:46.332
Well, we were this close
to winning.

27:46.333 --> 27:48.100
You know what?
We'll get 'em next year, killer.

27:48.101 --> 27:50.436
Plus, now we don't have the
pressure of having to repeat.

27:50.437 --> 27:52.037
Repeat?

27:52.038 --> 27:53.072
Pardon?

27:53.073 --> 27:55.741
Repeat. Repeat.

27:55.742 --> 27:57.943
Repeat.

27:57.944 --> 28:00.679
Repeat.

28:00.680 --> 28:02.314
Hank, that's funny, right?

28:02.315 --> 28:03.782
Uh, yeah.

28:03.783 --> 28:05.484
"Uh, yeah."

28:05.485 --> 28:08.120
How cute are you
when your being all doctor-y?

28:08.121 --> 28:09.488
He's so cute.

28:09.489 --> 28:10.723
Isn't he cute?
He's like...

28:10.724 --> 28:11.924
he's like this little puppy,
you know?

28:11.925 --> 28:13.425
You want to scratch him
behind the ears

28:13.426 --> 28:14.360
and scratch him on the belly.

28:14.361 --> 28:15.661
Okay.

28:15.662 --> 28:17.696
Clearly, someone's medication
has kicked in.

28:17.697 --> 28:19.064
Yeah, we're...
we're friends.

28:19.065 --> 28:21.000
Hmm.
You know, Hank is the best.

28:21.001 --> 28:22.201
He really is.

28:22.202 --> 28:23.469
Hank...

28:23.470 --> 28:24.637
You're the best.

28:24.638 --> 28:27.339
And I miss you, Hank.

28:27.340 --> 28:29.642
I really miss you.

28:29.643 --> 28:30.909
You know, good friends.

28:30.910 --> 28:34.980
Ah, we used to be
more than that,

28:34.981 --> 28:36.949
hanky panky.
Really good friends.

28:36.950 --> 28:38.484
Uh, and just for the record,

28:38.485 --> 28:40.352
that's the first time
she's ever called me that.

28:40.353 --> 28:42.021
- Okay.
- All righty, then.

28:43.256 --> 28:44.690
Hank, have you been
working out?

28:44.691 --> 28:47.259
- Uh, a little, but...
- Oh, my goodness.

28:47.260 --> 28:48.560
These are amazing.

28:48.561 --> 28:50.129
Look...
Okay, you know what, Jill?

28:50.130 --> 28:52.197
Why don't we lay you down
for some rest?

28:52.198 --> 28:54.700
She should get some rest.
Yeah, Jack, why don't you...

28:54.701 --> 28:56.635
- that's a good idea.
- Uh, yeah.

28:59.105 --> 29:00.606
Please stop licking my hand.

29:02.309 --> 29:04.310
Yeah, so that was a little...

29:04.311 --> 29:05.844
- Awkward.
- Yeah.

29:05.845 --> 29:07.413
Yeah. But, you know,
give her some time

29:07.414 --> 29:08.881
for the meds to wear off...
she'll be back.

29:08.882 --> 29:10.082
- Sure.
- Yeah.

29:10.083 --> 29:12.284
- Yeah.
- So how are your hands doing?

29:12.285 --> 29:14.253
- Good. Bad.
- Oh.

29:14.254 --> 29:15.821
Those injections
didn't do anything.

29:15.822 --> 29:17.790
Bummer...
I got to admit

29:17.791 --> 29:19.658
I was kind of getting
my hopes up a little bit.

29:19.659 --> 29:23.095
Here, let me try something
else... give me your hands.

29:23.096 --> 29:26.231
All right, this may hurt
a little, okay?

29:28.768 --> 29:30.703
Okay...

29:33.540 --> 29:35.641
Okay.
Agh, aha!

29:35.642 --> 29:36.875
Jeez, doc.

29:36.876 --> 29:39.845
I'm glad you have
a high pain threshold.

29:39.846 --> 29:42.414
Hol... hold on a second.

29:42.415 --> 29:44.750
I can move... I can move 'em.
Yeah.

29:44.751 --> 29:45.951
I can... I can move.

29:45.952 --> 29:47.553
Why didn't you just do
that before?

29:47.554 --> 29:49.254
The medication had to kick in
and loosen the ligaments.

29:49.255 --> 29:50.689
And we'll also do
a follow-up next week.

29:50.690 --> 29:53.225
This... this is amazing.

29:53.226 --> 29:54.793
Looks like you need
a new nickname.

29:54.794 --> 29:56.261
You got that right,
hanky panky.

29:56.262 --> 29:57.730
And so do I.

29:57.731 --> 30:00.632
Jack O'Malley...
Is back!

30:00.633 --> 30:02.201
That's great.

30:02.202 --> 30:04.169
Of course, now I guess
I have to deliver.

30:04.170 --> 30:06.004
Yeah, that's the thing
about second chances.

30:06.005 --> 30:08.040
If you get one, you...

30:08.041 --> 30:10.509
You kind of got to take it.

30:10.510 --> 30:12.511
I don't know how to thank you.

30:12.512 --> 30:14.179
Well, you could shake my hand.

30:17.650 --> 30:19.852
- Hit a hold-in-one,
win a boat.

30:19.853 --> 30:21.186
Everyone's welcome.

30:25.558 --> 30:27.993
Tough luck, buddy.

30:27.994 --> 30:29.695
Hey, what's up?

30:29.696 --> 30:31.363
Oh, my God,
what took you so long?

30:31.364 --> 30:33.932
I texted you 100 times.
We need to talk.

30:33.933 --> 30:36.068
- Okay, then why are you playing
in a hole-in-one contest?

30:36.069 --> 30:38.003
'Cause I support our troops.

30:38.004 --> 30:39.605
You know she's
not a real sailor, right?

30:40.707 --> 30:44.009
So I got some serious
4-1-1 on dad.

30:44.010 --> 30:46.879
You were right about him,
but so was I.

30:46.880 --> 30:49.248
Wait, that was what
you texted me 100 times about?

30:49.249 --> 30:50.649
- No, I...
- It's your turn.

30:50.650 --> 30:52.284
Oh, really?
Okay, cool.

30:52.285 --> 30:54.153
Um, we'll talk more in private.

30:54.154 --> 30:55.187
It's a private thing anyway.

30:55.188 --> 30:56.822
After I swing. Great.
Okay.

30:58.658 --> 31:00.626
Okay.

31:00.627 --> 31:02.928
Thanks.
You're welcome.

31:02.929 --> 31:05.531
All right, ev, let's do this.

31:05.532 --> 31:06.965
You got this.

31:09.202 --> 31:10.602
Noonan!

31:10.603 --> 31:12.871
Sorry.

31:12.872 --> 31:14.573
You can do it.

31:14.574 --> 31:15.641
All in the wrist...

31:15.642 --> 31:17.776
And the hips.

31:17.777 --> 31:19.945
Wrist, hips.

31:32.525 --> 31:34.960
It's in the hole!
It's in the hole!

31:34.961 --> 31:36.395
It's a hole in one!

31:37.797 --> 31:39.031
That was awesome!

31:39.032 --> 31:40.966
Dude! You...

31:40.967 --> 31:42.568
hello?
You just won the boat.

31:42.569 --> 31:44.336
You won it!
Here. Will you sign for me?

31:44.337 --> 31:45.671
I got to go.
I got to go.

31:45.672 --> 31:47.306
What...?

31:53.746 --> 31:56.181
So should...

32:18.071 --> 32:20.105
So I just want to begin

32:20.106 --> 32:22.341
by apologizing on behalf
of the Lawson family

32:22.342 --> 32:24.009
for what my father did.

32:24.010 --> 32:27.112
You needn't apologize.

32:27.113 --> 32:29.014
Come.

32:29.015 --> 32:30.549
This is...

32:38.091 --> 32:41.960
Do you know why I gave you
that file, Mr. Lawson?

32:48.368 --> 32:49.835
No.

32:49.836 --> 32:53.505
Well, Hank seems
to understand your father.

32:53.506 --> 32:55.874
I thought it might be time
that you did as well.

32:58.411 --> 33:00.145
All right.

33:00.146 --> 33:01.914
Why are you being so nice to us

33:01.915 --> 33:04.650
after what our father
did to you?

33:04.651 --> 33:07.719
Well, we are
not our parents, are we?

33:07.720 --> 33:09.955
We cannot be held responsible
for their actions.

33:09.956 --> 33:11.890
Don't you agree?

33:11.891 --> 33:15.360
Good.

33:15.361 --> 33:16.495
Evan...

33:16.496 --> 33:18.597
If you desire for your father

33:18.598 --> 33:21.533
to have a less stressful
environment

33:21.534 --> 33:23.001
in which to recuperate...

33:23.002 --> 33:24.770
Less stressful?

33:24.771 --> 33:26.038
There are climates
more comfortable

33:26.039 --> 33:28.340
where Eddie r. Lawson
might convalesce.

33:29.976 --> 33:34.446
And I can make
those arrangements.

33:37.684 --> 33:40.619
Well, you think about it.

33:47.293 --> 33:48.994
So he just knocks
the white off the ball.

33:48.995 --> 33:52.197
It goes sailing,
bounces off the golf cart,

33:52.198 --> 33:54.099
and then, bam,
right into the hole!

33:54.100 --> 33:57.869
I mean, how Evan is that?

33:57.870 --> 34:00.205
It's so Evan!

34:00.206 --> 34:02.507
And now we have to watch him
christen the boat,

34:02.508 --> 34:05.611
you know, pretend
he's Captain ahab,

34:05.612 --> 34:08.013
even though he's more like
Captain crunch.

34:08.014 --> 34:11.750
I guess the upside is he could
go off on a three-hour tour.

34:11.751 --> 34:13.118
Nothing on that?

34:13.119 --> 34:15.020
♪ A three-hour tour ♪

34:15.021 --> 34:17.723
Hello?
Hank...

34:19.359 --> 34:21.326
I crossed an unacceptable line.

34:22.695 --> 34:24.795
I became involved
with a patient.

34:24.797 --> 34:26.598
You did?

34:28.534 --> 34:30.435
I kissed him.

34:32.105 --> 34:33.572
But I ended it.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.741
And I will, of course,

34:35.742 --> 34:38.810
in no way continue
to treat him medically.

34:38.811 --> 34:41.580
That's why you're
flying out to London tonight...

34:41.581 --> 34:42.848
To see raj.

34:42.849 --> 34:46.818
I can only imagine
how furious you are with me.

34:46.819 --> 34:50.121
It was highly unprofessional.

34:50.123 --> 34:52.190
And if you need me to,

34:52.190 --> 34:55.460
I will resign from hankmed,
effective immediately.

34:55.460 --> 34:57.329
Resign?

34:57.330 --> 34:58.764
Please. I... no.

34:58.765 --> 35:00.732
I don't care about that.

35:00.733 --> 35:03.535
What I care about is you.

35:03.536 --> 35:05.337
Are you okay?

35:07.707 --> 35:09.007
No.

35:12.378 --> 35:14.179
No.

35:14.180 --> 35:15.480
I'm not.

35:17.784 --> 35:21.486
But I've got it under control.

35:21.487 --> 35:23.655
Is there anything I can do?

35:26.192 --> 35:28.593
No.

35:28.594 --> 35:30.195
No, but, uh...

35:32.098 --> 35:35.801
Oh, but thank you so much
for being you.

35:41.908 --> 35:43.842
I'm sorry.

35:51.993 --> 35:54.394
My point is that
everything dad did,

35:54.395 --> 35:55.562
he did to be with us.

35:55.563 --> 35:56.997
Yeah, and my point is
that you learned that

35:56.998 --> 35:58.431
from his criminal
defense attorney.

35:58.432 --> 36:01.668
You see, this is why people
like me better than you, Hank.

36:01.669 --> 36:02.836
You're a gray cloud.

36:02.837 --> 36:04.337
I'm a silver lining, myself.

36:04.338 --> 36:06.473
Wait. People like you
better than me?

36:06.474 --> 36:07.841
They will, when they find out

36:07.842 --> 36:09.776
♪ about my new yacht ♪

36:09.777 --> 36:12.479
- Oh, God.
- I'm a yacht owner.

36:12.480 --> 36:15.215
I own a yacht, a giant yacht.

36:15.216 --> 36:16.917
What do you think
about the name

36:16.918 --> 36:19.052
<i>fairway to Evan.</i>

36:19.053 --> 36:21.321
Hmm. You spend a lot
of time on that one?

36:21.322 --> 36:22.823
Like two hours.

36:22.824 --> 36:25.258
It's a good use of your time.

36:25.259 --> 36:27.194
<i>And, Evan, it's a boat.</i>

36:27.195 --> 36:29.663
Just for that, I now have an
extra spot at the christening.

36:29.664 --> 36:31.565
No, plea...
please let me come!

36:31.566 --> 36:33.567

Hey.

36:41.409 --> 36:44.244
- This is for you.
- Really?

36:44.245 --> 36:45.979
Thank you, Jill.

36:53.654 --> 36:55.755
Um, knickers.

36:55.756 --> 36:56.923
Yeah.

36:56.924 --> 36:58.558
They're a consolation prize.

36:58.559 --> 36:59.759
Why do I need to be consoled?

36:59.760 --> 37:01.394
I'm about to pick up
my brand-new yacht.

37:01.395 --> 37:02.729
Yeah...

37:02.730 --> 37:04.397
About that...

37:04.398 --> 37:06.733
Oh, I don't know where this
is going, but I like it.

37:06.734 --> 37:08.368
All right, what?

37:08.369 --> 37:10.270
Uh, while I was still
loopy from the meds,

37:10.271 --> 37:14.274
I may have let it slip
that you worked for hankmed.

37:14.275 --> 37:15.642
So?

37:15.643 --> 37:17.510
So tournament employees

37:17.511 --> 37:19.479
aren't eligible for prizes.

37:19.480 --> 37:21.014
As well they shouldn't be.

37:34.061 --> 37:35.528
Well...

37:35.529 --> 37:38.932
I'm, a... I'm a yachtsman
without a yacht.

37:40.368 --> 37:42.969
I look freakin' ridiculous now.

37:42.970 --> 37:44.104
Yeah.

37:44.105 --> 37:45.639
That's why you look ridiculous.

37:45.640 --> 37:47.240
Be nice.

37:47.241 --> 37:49.309
- I'm gonna go change.
- Okay.

37:49.310 --> 37:52.245
Don't forget your knickers.

37:52.246 --> 37:53.647
Evan, I'm sorry.

37:55.416 --> 37:57.484
So...

37:57.485 --> 37:58.885
You're taking up golf?

37:58.886 --> 38:00.887
Yeah.

38:03.691 --> 38:04.991
Bam!
It's not so hard.

38:04.992 --> 38:06.326
I don't see
what the big deal is.

38:06.327 --> 38:07.327
You want to play?
I'll take you down.

38:07.328 --> 38:08.929
Really?

38:08.930 --> 38:11.031
Nah, I can't. I just wanted
to give Evan his knickers.

38:11.032 --> 38:12.732
And thank you for that.

38:12.733 --> 38:15.335
Yeah, and to apologize

38:15.336 --> 38:17.804
for anything I may have said
while loopy.

38:17.805 --> 38:19.139
Oh, yeah, no...

38:19.140 --> 38:20.640
no idea
what you're talking about.

38:20.641 --> 38:22.776
So I didn't say
anything stupid?

38:22.777 --> 38:24.177
I'm afraid I can't say.

38:24.178 --> 38:25.612
Doctor-patient
confidentiality.

38:25.613 --> 38:27.814
Oh, come on, Hank,
I'm the patient.

38:27.815 --> 38:30.417
No, that was a Jill
I have never seen before.

38:30.418 --> 38:33.820
You sure you don't want to putt?
I can't. Jack's waiting.

38:33.821 --> 38:35.622
Jack? Jack.

38:35.623 --> 38:37.624
Right. Okay.

38:37.625 --> 38:39.025
Yeah, no, that's cool.

38:39.026 --> 38:40.527
Yeah.

38:40.528 --> 38:42.729
So, you know,
whether you heard or not

38:42.730 --> 38:45.265
or whether I said it or not,

38:45.266 --> 38:48.335
I'm sorry for anything
too stupid I may have let slip.

38:50.404 --> 38:54.541
What if I may have
kind of liked it?

38:55.876 --> 38:57.077
You may have?

38:57.078 --> 38:58.611
Yeah, I may have.

38:58.612 --> 39:00.547
I don't know... with everything
that happened with my father,

39:00.548 --> 39:02.816
I guess it's made me
reassess things.

39:02.817 --> 39:06.286
- What kind of things?
- All kinds of things.

39:06.287 --> 39:09.089
But let's not do this now.
Jack's waiting.

39:09.090 --> 39:10.357
Yeah.

39:10.358 --> 39:11.891
Yeah.

39:11.892 --> 39:15.195
- Another time?
- Yeah, some other time.

39:22.970 --> 39:25.138
I miss you too.

39:38.786 --> 39:41.888
Who doesn't love the beach?

39:41.889 --> 39:42.956
It's calming.

39:42.957 --> 39:44.524
That's good for you.
Yeah.

39:44.525 --> 39:47.894
Yeah, but the Hamptons
can be stressful, right?

39:47.895 --> 39:49.662
Which isn't good for you.

39:49.663 --> 39:53.333
Dad, do you ever think maybe
there's someplace else

39:53.334 --> 39:54.901
where you might be
more comfortable?

39:54.902 --> 39:56.436
Yeah, no, 'cause, I mean,
this is so grueling.

39:56.437 --> 39:57.504
Wow.

39:57.505 --> 39:58.872
Why would you want
to stay here?

39:58.873 --> 40:01.141
Well, there are climates
more comfortable

40:01.142 --> 40:03.676
where dad could...
you know, could convalesce.

40:03.677 --> 40:05.945
Why are you speaking like that?

40:05.946 --> 40:08.281
- Uh...
- I got my two boys...

40:08.282 --> 40:10.850
Miss Newberg.

40:10.851 --> 40:13.353
Look at this view.

40:13.354 --> 40:14.721
Does it get
any better than this?

40:14.722 --> 40:15.889
Come on.

40:15.890 --> 40:18.258
Schmoopy!

40:18.259 --> 40:20.527
Oh, m...
would you look at her?

40:20.528 --> 40:22.228
Is that a dream?

40:22.229 --> 40:24.964
Oh, you know what?
Somebody should go and help her.

40:24.965 --> 40:27.000
And my heart, I would, but...

40:27.001 --> 40:28.201
oh, I got it.

40:28.202 --> 40:29.469
No, no, I got to get
another beer anyway.

40:29.470 --> 40:31.171
Thank you, Evan.

40:31.172 --> 40:33.506
Thanks, Evan.

40:33.507 --> 40:35.275
I have a confession to make.

40:35.276 --> 40:37.010
Oh, God.

40:37.011 --> 40:38.812
Here we go.
What?

40:38.813 --> 40:40.814
I can't swim.

40:40.815 --> 40:43.716
There, I said it.
Okay.

40:43.717 --> 40:45.151
Eddie r. Lawson cannot swim.

40:45.152 --> 40:47.287
I can't even dog-paddle
to safety.

40:47.288 --> 40:48.421
What are you talk...
we used to swim

40:48.422 --> 40:49.789
all the time
when we were little.

40:49.790 --> 40:51.124
I remember, we...
No, you remember

40:51.125 --> 40:53.059
me saying I could swim,

40:53.060 --> 40:55.061
me bragging
about how much of a...

40:55.062 --> 40:56.496
like a fish I was.

40:56.497 --> 40:57.697
That was just all talk.

40:57.698 --> 40:59.299
All right, okay.
So you can't swim.

40:59.300 --> 41:01.734
You're telling me this why?

41:01.735 --> 41:03.703
Because when I told you
I could swim,

41:03.704 --> 41:06.239
that was the first lie
I ever told you.

41:07.808 --> 41:09.509
Okay. So...

41:09.510 --> 41:11.678
but why lie
about that? I...

41:11.679 --> 41:13.413
Because I didn't want
to be the guy

41:13.414 --> 41:16.149
who couldn't do everything.

41:16.150 --> 41:19.185
I wanted to be your hero.

41:19.186 --> 41:21.221
We didn't need you
to be our hero.

41:21.222 --> 41:23.790
I needed it.

41:26.026 --> 41:29.028
You know how some people
have, like, um...

41:29.029 --> 41:31.698
A near-death experience,
and it just changes their life?

41:31.699 --> 41:33.233
That happen to you?

41:33.234 --> 41:36.302
No, I'm too old
to have anything change me.

41:36.303 --> 41:38.338
But I swear to you,

41:38.339 --> 41:42.041
there was a moment
when I saw you and Evan

41:42.042 --> 41:43.843
as little boys.

41:43.844 --> 41:48.581
Yeah, when you had your heart
attack, there was a moment...

41:48.582 --> 41:50.383
I thought
we were gonna lose you.

41:50.384 --> 41:52.485
- Really?
- Yeah.

41:52.486 --> 41:54.487
And I realized
I don't want to lose you.

41:54.488 --> 41:56.789
I couldn't.
I can't.

41:58.659 --> 42:01.661
I guess what
I'm trying to say is, uh...

42:01.662 --> 42:05.064
I want you to stick around
to be our dad.

42:07.067 --> 42:09.302
You're giving me
a second chance.

42:09.303 --> 42:12.238
Call it a mulligan.
