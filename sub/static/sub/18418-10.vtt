ANNOUNCER: Previously,
on "Nashville"...

00:02.540 --> 00:03.880
- Patient was found unconscious

00:03.880 --> 00:05.380
with a crush injury
to her pelvis...

00:05.380 --> 00:07.880
- Oh, my God.
That's Rayna James.

00:07.880 --> 00:09.710
- Sweetie, I need you to meet me
at the hospital, okay?

00:09.710 --> 00:11.380
- What's wrong?

00:11.380 --> 00:12.830
- If something happens,

00:12.830 --> 00:15.540
you gotta stay strong
for the girls.

00:15.540 --> 00:17.120
- We are artificially
supporting her blood pressure

00:17.120 --> 00:19.040
at this point.
And her organs are failing.

00:19.040 --> 00:22.330
(monitor flatlines)
(crying)

00:22.330 --> 00:24.960
- No! No!

00:38.790 --> 00:43.040
- "She was my north,
my south,

00:43.040 --> 00:45.830
"my east and west.

00:45.830 --> 00:50.620
"My working week,
my Sunday rest.

00:50.620 --> 00:53.210
"My noon...

00:53.210 --> 00:56.960
"midnight...

00:56.960 --> 01:01.830
"my talk...
my song.

01:07.920 --> 01:11.420
"I thought that love
would last forever.

01:11.420 --> 01:12.710
I was wrong."

01:18.170 --> 01:22.170
(birds flutter)

01:24.710 --> 01:26.790
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

01:26.790 --> 01:27.960
- I'll take that for you.

01:30.170 --> 01:31.620
- I never know what
to say at these moments.

01:31.620 --> 01:33.830
- Oh, nobody does.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.830
- I can't believe this storm.

01:37.830 --> 01:39.500
- I know.

01:39.500 --> 01:42.830
It's like the sky's crying too.

01:58.920 --> 02:00.790
- Can I take these?
- Thanks.

02:00.790 --> 02:02.380
- Hi, sweet girl.

02:06.290 --> 02:08.960
- Oh, I can't count.

02:08.960 --> 02:11.080
- Let me do it.

02:12.750 --> 02:14.920
Oh, Rayna would hate us all

02:14.920 --> 02:17.210
packed in her kitchen like this.

02:17.210 --> 02:19.330
She would just
chase us right out.

02:26.420 --> 02:28.460
- Hey.
- Hi, Pam.

02:28.460 --> 02:30.580
- Oh, thank you.
- I'm so sorry.

03:50.920 --> 03:54.210
- Come be with us.
- Okay.

03:54.210 --> 03:56.040
- Just you for a second?

03:59.210 --> 04:01.080
- (sighs)
- Too many people.

04:01.080 --> 04:02.620
- Oh, I know, sweetheart.

04:02.620 --> 04:04.710
We gotta hold onto
each other so tight today.

04:04.710 --> 04:06.670
Do you know where
your daddy's at?

04:06.670 --> 04:09.750
- Uh...I don't know.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.960
- Okay. I need you two
to stay together today.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.080
Can you do that?
Come on.

04:18.830 --> 04:21.120
- Hi.
- Uh...

04:21.120 --> 04:23.420
- Would you mind helping to pass
these around to people?

04:23.420 --> 04:24.830
- Um...
- Thank you very much.

04:24.830 --> 04:27.120
- No problem.

04:27.120 --> 04:29.040
- You seen Deacon anywhere?

04:29.040 --> 04:31.120
- No, I haven't.
I'm sorry.

04:31.120 --> 04:33.040
- It's okay.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.380
- I have to change her.

04:34.380 --> 04:35.790
Is there somewhere
I can change her?

04:35.790 --> 04:37.830
- Of course,
you come with me down here.

04:41.750 --> 04:44.120
- Hey, man, let me
take that for you.

04:44.120 --> 04:47.420
This must be weird enough
for you as it is.

04:47.420 --> 04:50.210
- Yeah, sort of.
Thanks.

04:55.210 --> 04:57.540
- Tell me this is a dream.

04:57.540 --> 04:59.250
- God, I wish it was.

04:59.250 --> 05:01.460
- Oh, Watty.

05:01.460 --> 05:05.580
- She was a great lady,
to state the obvious.

05:05.580 --> 05:07.580
- I'm out of words myself.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.580

05:29.580 --> 05:33.330
So I just started
putting this together.

05:33.330 --> 05:34.920
- Sorry, I can't...

05:34.920 --> 05:36.420
(music stops)

05:39.620 --> 05:41.540
- Sheesh, not the best timing.

05:41.540 --> 05:43.670
- Stupid idea.
I shouldn't have done that.

05:43.670 --> 05:45.960
- Oh, it's fine.
You meant well.

05:47.830 --> 05:49.330
- Hey.
- Hey, Juliette.

05:52.250 --> 05:54.920
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:54.920 --> 05:56.500
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.790
- Looking forward
to your gospel album.

05:58.790 --> 06:00.790
- Oh, thank you.
This is empty...

06:00.790 --> 06:02.290
Do you mind watching her
real quick?

06:02.290 --> 06:03.790
- No.

06:03.790 --> 06:06.380
- I need to fill her juice.
- Okay...

06:06.380 --> 06:07.670
Hey.

06:09.830 --> 06:11.670
- Here, I'll take her.

06:11.670 --> 06:12.960
- Sorry.
- Oh, no, that's fine.

06:12.960 --> 06:14.500
Come here, sweetie.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.920
- To Rayna.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.790
I didn't know her very long,

06:31.790 --> 06:35.380
but I always felt a very deep
connection with her, and...

06:39.920 --> 06:42.380
Okay, sorry, someone stop me
from talking right now.

06:42.380 --> 06:44.750
- To living every day
of your life.

06:49.080 --> 06:51.460
- She's getting so big.

06:51.460 --> 06:53.120
- I know...
- It happens fast.

06:53.120 --> 06:56.460
- You always think we have
all the time in the world.

07:10.250 --> 07:12.880
- I was gonna give you a call
at some point.

07:12.880 --> 07:15.420
Look, we don't need to
deal with this right now.

07:15.420 --> 07:17.710
But the CMT people called.

07:17.710 --> 07:20.790
They're trying to figure out
a replacement for Rayna.

07:20.790 --> 07:22.580
Someone to sing
a tribute to her.

07:22.580 --> 07:24.120
- Who are they talking about?

07:24.120 --> 07:25.830
- They're talking about Faith.

07:25.830 --> 07:27.500
- Faith?
- I'm sorry.

07:27.500 --> 07:29.250
I know this isn't the best time
to be bringing this up.

07:29.250 --> 07:30.830
- Oh, I want you to call them,
and tell them

07:30.830 --> 07:32.170
that I am the only person
who should be doing that.

07:32.170 --> 07:34.000
I was the closest to Rayna.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.960
- I think they're just worried
you're not well enough.

07:35.960 --> 07:39.210
- I'm absolutely
damn well enough!

07:39.210 --> 07:41.830
Just call them, please?

07:41.830 --> 07:43.330
- All right, I'm on it.

07:48.960 --> 07:52.290
- Deacon?

07:58.880 --> 08:02.120
I just came to see
how you were doing.

08:02.120 --> 08:06.880
If I could bring
you anything at all.

08:06.880 --> 08:08.460
Is it still raining?

08:08.460 --> 08:10.330
- I don't know.

08:16.540 --> 08:20.210
What's the time?

08:20.210 --> 08:22.920
- Do you want to
come out for a minute?

08:25.710 --> 08:29.210
You can be like this.

08:29.210 --> 08:32.380
You can be any way
you need to be.

08:32.380 --> 08:35.080
We're family.

08:35.080 --> 08:39.460
Um...Zach gave me this for you.

08:39.460 --> 08:44.170
It's of you, Rayna
and the girls.

08:44.170 --> 08:46.040
You don't have to
look at it now.

09:12.040 --> 09:15.500
- We had some good years
together, me and Rayna.

09:15.500 --> 09:18.290
I mean, with the girls.

09:18.290 --> 09:19.960
- How long did they
let you out for?

09:19.960 --> 09:21.580
- Just three days.

09:21.580 --> 09:22.960
Standard bereavement leave.

09:26.120 --> 09:28.080
So where's Deacon?

09:28.080 --> 09:29.210
- He's still in his bedroom.

09:29.210 --> 09:30.710
Hardly had a word with him.

09:30.710 --> 09:33.460
I don't know
what's gonna happen.

09:33.460 --> 09:36.210
- You know, everyone
will somehow go on.

09:36.210 --> 09:37.620
Isn't that what
we're supposed to do?

09:37.620 --> 09:41.040
- I mean, the girls.
I'm worried.

09:41.040 --> 09:43.420
Deacon is barely functioning.

09:43.420 --> 09:45.250
We've got the lawyers tomorrow,

09:45.250 --> 09:46.920
and all the Highway 65
stuff to deal with.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.000
- I just think Deacon's
not gonna be able to cope

09:49.000 --> 09:50.830
with anything like that
right now.

09:50.830 --> 09:52.790
- I know.
And Zach just told me

09:52.790 --> 09:55.380
that Highway 65 just bought
Wheelin' Dealin' Records.

09:55.380 --> 09:58.920
And that that payment's due
for starters.

09:58.920 --> 10:01.710
I think for now,

10:01.710 --> 10:03.500
you and I should be the ones
to handle all of this.

10:07.380 --> 10:10.710
- You're hungry, huh? I know.

10:10.710 --> 10:13.080
You know you're hungry.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.420
- Oh!
- Hey!

10:15.420 --> 10:17.420
- Good news. You're on.

10:17.420 --> 10:19.250
CMT said yes.

10:19.250 --> 10:20.670
- You're kidding me!
- No.

10:20.670 --> 10:22.880
- That's amazing!

10:22.880 --> 10:24.040
- They loved the idea.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.460
We'll give them a call tomorrow

10:25.460 --> 10:26.920
to work out the details,
but it is happening.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.920
- Glenn, you're the best!

10:28.920 --> 10:30.170
Thank you!

10:31.580 --> 10:34.330
Hey, monkey!
Where's your cup...

10:47.540 --> 10:48.750
- Take care now.

10:48.750 --> 10:51.620
- Thanks...you too.

10:53.210 --> 10:56.750
Hey, I was wondering.

10:56.750 --> 10:59.380
Am I still in your phone?

10:59.380 --> 11:01.920
- Yeah, of course you are.

11:01.920 --> 11:05.210
- Okay. Good to know.

11:05.210 --> 11:07.880
- I just--

11:07.880 --> 11:09.710
I didn't think it'd be right

11:09.710 --> 11:12.710
with us working together.

11:12.710 --> 11:16.620
- Well, I am not exactly one
to stand on ceremony,

11:16.620 --> 11:19.420
if you know what I mean.

11:19.420 --> 11:22.290
- Yeah. I think I do.

11:32.330 --> 11:34.000
- Hey, have you seen
Clay anywhere?

11:34.000 --> 11:37.080
- No. How you holding up?

11:37.080 --> 11:42.040
- I'm not.
I just look like I am.

11:42.040 --> 11:44.710
- You remind me
so much of Rayna.

11:44.710 --> 11:45.710
- Thank you.

11:45.710 --> 11:47.580
- You have her fire.

11:47.580 --> 11:50.380
- Why can't everybody
just go home?

11:50.380 --> 11:52.120
- Let's just get you
to bed, sweetheart.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.120
- I'm not even sleepy.
- I know, baby.

11:54.120 --> 11:55.710
- Have you seen Clay anywhere?

11:55.710 --> 11:58.120
- No, I haven't seen him
in a while, sorry.

12:03.620 --> 12:05.290
- There you are.

12:05.290 --> 12:08.620
- Hey. I'm sorry.

12:08.620 --> 12:10.040
I just had to get out of there.

12:10.040 --> 12:12.500
- You're not even
gonna say goodbye?

12:12.500 --> 12:15.290
- No, of course I was,
I just--

12:15.290 --> 12:17.710
I didn't know what I was
supposed to do in there.

12:20.670 --> 12:21.710
- Well, can you come back in?

12:21.710 --> 12:24.500
- Look, I'm so sorry.

12:24.500 --> 12:26.710
I know you're in pain.
I just...

12:29.500 --> 12:31.460
- You can go.

12:31.460 --> 12:32.670
- Look, Maddie,
I want to be here for you.

12:32.670 --> 12:34.000
I do, it's just...

12:34.000 --> 12:36.540
- No, I'm good.
It's fine.

12:36.540 --> 12:38.790
- Look I'm s--
I'll call you.

12:49.250 --> 12:51.960
- You okay?

12:51.960 --> 12:55.960
- Uh, we still got a few
working bathrooms.

12:55.960 --> 12:58.040
I can't find Bucky anywhere.

12:58.040 --> 13:01.420
And somebody lost
their car keys.

13:01.420 --> 13:03.920
You must be exhausted.
Let me make you some tea.

13:03.920 --> 13:06.790
- No, no, it gives me
something to do, at least.

13:06.790 --> 13:08.540
- All right.

13:08.540 --> 13:10.880
- I might just go
check in on Daphne.

13:20.620 --> 13:24.620
(crying)

13:34.250 --> 13:37.040

get right to it.

16:14.420 --> 16:17.540
We have an unusual
situation here.

16:17.540 --> 16:19.120
It appears the deceased

16:19.120 --> 16:21.330
had not appointed guardianship
for the children.

16:21.330 --> 16:23.960
And subsequently for the estate
prior to her death.

16:23.960 --> 16:25.790
- That's unbelievable.

16:25.790 --> 16:27.710
- But not uncommon.

16:27.710 --> 16:29.250
We find that when
people remarry,

16:29.250 --> 16:31.380
they may take some time
to reappoint guardianship.

16:31.380 --> 16:34.000
When an estate is in probate,

16:34.000 --> 16:35.620
we need to establish
guardianship

16:35.620 --> 16:37.250
both for the children

16:37.250 --> 16:39.330
and for any businesses
such as Highway 65.

16:39.330 --> 16:42.750
Usually, guardianship
of the children and the business

16:42.750 --> 16:45.710
is held by the same person
until they become of age.

16:45.710 --> 16:48.040
It's imperative that
this be established

16:48.040 --> 16:49.170
as soon as possible.

16:49.170 --> 16:50.880
- Well, Daphne is my daughter

16:50.880 --> 16:52.460
and Maddie too, for that matter.

16:52.460 --> 16:54.120
I legally adopted her.

16:54.120 --> 16:56.920
- It's not that simple.

16:56.920 --> 16:58.290
- Actually,
Mr. Conrad is correct.

16:58.290 --> 17:02.210
He is Daphne's
biological father.

17:02.210 --> 17:04.920
And he is legally
Maddie's adopted father.

17:04.920 --> 17:07.620
I was about to say that
this can be contested

17:07.620 --> 17:09.120
by anyone who feels they
have the right to do so.

17:09.120 --> 17:11.750
If the guardianship
is contested by anyone,

17:11.750 --> 17:13.040
a court date will
have to be set.

17:13.040 --> 17:14.580
And a judge will hear testimony

17:14.580 --> 17:15.790
in order to reach a decision.

17:15.790 --> 17:17.500
- Testimony from whom?

17:17.500 --> 17:19.880
- The children mostly.

17:19.880 --> 17:21.710
It's not 100%, but a judge
would definitely factor in

17:21.710 --> 17:23.420
what the children have
to say about this.

17:35.960 --> 17:37.710
- I feel numb.

17:37.710 --> 17:41.170
Right now, all I can think
about is Daphne and Maddie.

17:41.170 --> 17:44.620
- Deacon hasn't said one word
to me about the girls.

17:44.620 --> 17:46.790
I don't know what to do.

17:46.790 --> 17:49.500
- Well, my lawyers say
I'll be out in three months.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.460
The point is, I'll definitely
be back here soon.

17:51.460 --> 17:53.250
- Thank God.

17:53.250 --> 17:56.120
The girls have been with you
from the beginning.

17:56.120 --> 17:58.120
You should be their guardian.

17:58.120 --> 18:00.170
- And what about Maddie's
testimony in court about Deacon?

18:00.170 --> 18:02.210
- What? No!

18:02.210 --> 18:04.120
None of that was even true!

18:04.120 --> 18:06.080
You can't hold that against him!
I won't let you!

18:06.080 --> 18:07.920
- There's more to it
than that, honey.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.080
- How can you possibly
decide this for us?

18:09.080 --> 18:10.580
- Look, it's not just me.

18:10.580 --> 18:11.920
We all have to agree.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.420
- How's that ever gonna happen?

18:17.750 --> 18:19.750
- Dad?
- Yeah?

18:19.750 --> 18:21.960
- Dad, I'm so scared.
- Come here, baby...

18:21.960 --> 18:23.790
- No, listen.
Teddy and Tandy are saying

18:23.790 --> 18:25.750
that you aren't fit
to be my father.

18:25.750 --> 18:27.120
- Is that right?
- Yes.

18:27.120 --> 18:28.880
Teddy thinks he
should be our guardian.

18:28.880 --> 18:30.540
They're planning to do
something behind your back.

18:30.540 --> 18:32.380
- Ain't nothing like that
is gonna happen.

18:32.380 --> 18:33.420
- No, something bad
is going to happen!

18:33.420 --> 18:34.670
I know it!

18:34.670 --> 18:36.460
- You have to do
something right now!

18:38.500 --> 18:40.580
- I'll figure this out, okay?

18:47.710 --> 18:49.460
- Okay, thank you, yeah.

18:49.460 --> 18:51.750
It's good. Yes, I will.

18:54.290 --> 18:56.290
- Was that your parole officer?

18:56.290 --> 18:58.040
- It's confirmed.

18:58.040 --> 18:59.880
I'm gonna be out
in three months.

18:59.880 --> 19:02.040
- That's wonderful.

19:02.040 --> 19:03.500
- What's all that?

19:03.500 --> 19:06.170
- Oh, just some papers
that the lawyer gave me.

19:06.170 --> 19:07.420
- I'd like to take
a look at 'em.

19:09.920 --> 19:11.880
- Of course. We should all
look at them together.

19:11.880 --> 19:13.330
- And it looks like
I'm gonna be here

19:13.330 --> 19:15.500
to handle whatever
needs to be done, so...

19:15.500 --> 19:19.210
- Yeah. Congratulations on being
released from prison.

19:19.210 --> 19:21.460
- Deacon, Teddy's just
trying to help.

19:21.460 --> 19:23.540
We know that you're not up
for this right now.

19:23.540 --> 19:26.210
I mean, who would be?
- I would be.

19:26.210 --> 19:27.830
- Highway 65 needs
a steady hand.

19:27.830 --> 19:29.830
We want to make sure
that we don't lose

19:29.830 --> 19:32.080
everything that Rayna
worked so hard for.

19:32.080 --> 19:33.460
- You don't think
that's what I want?

19:33.460 --> 19:35.120
Rayna was my wife, right?

19:35.120 --> 19:36.790
We discussed every single
business decision

19:36.790 --> 19:38.830
ever made at Highway 65.

19:38.830 --> 19:40.580
- Well, then you'll remember

19:40.580 --> 19:42.290
that I put millions of dollars

19:42.290 --> 19:45.330
of my own money into Highway 65.

19:45.330 --> 19:46.920
And I'd really like to
see that it succeeds.

19:46.920 --> 19:48.500
- I just think you both
need to back off

19:48.500 --> 19:51.420
a little bit, that's all.

19:51.420 --> 19:53.080
- Well, I guess we'll
just have to see

19:53.080 --> 19:55.170
what the judge has
to say about all this.

19:55.170 --> 19:58.380
- Yes. Let's do that.

19:58.380 --> 20:00.250
I'm looking forward to it.

20:06.670 --> 20:08.330
- Hey, Clay, it's me.

20:08.330 --> 20:11.750
I just don't really know
what's going on with you,

20:11.750 --> 20:15.420
with me, or...
anything right now.

20:15.420 --> 20:17.170
So just call me, okay?

20:20.880 --> 20:23.710
- Hey.

20:23.710 --> 20:25.000
- I want to run away.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.750
- You can't.
- I know.

20:26.750 --> 20:29.250
I just don't want to
deal with anything right now.

20:29.250 --> 20:31.380
- Why is everybody
whispering around here?

20:31.380 --> 20:32.420
Seriously, what is going on?

20:32.420 --> 20:35.880
- Aunt Tandy and Teddy and Dad,

20:35.880 --> 20:39.380
they're all trying to figure out
who our guardian should be.

20:39.380 --> 20:42.790
And if they can't agree,
then a judge has to decide.

20:42.790 --> 20:44.920
- I just want Mom.

20:48.210 --> 20:50.580
- Me too.

20:50.580 --> 20:52.580
- I dreamt last night
that she was still alive.

20:55.750 --> 20:59.210
I heard her singing.

20:59.210 --> 21:02.540
- I heard her too.

21:02.540 --> 21:05.170
What do you think that means?

21:05.170 --> 21:09.460
- I don't want to choose
who my dad's gonna be.

21:09.460 --> 21:12.040
- I don't think it's really
gonna be our decision anyways.

21:12.040 --> 21:14.040
- That's why I'm so scared.

21:14.040 --> 21:17.120
What if the judge says you
go with Deacon and I don't...

21:17.120 --> 21:18.670
- No. Listen, Daphne,

21:18.670 --> 21:20.960
I would never let them
split us up, I promise.

21:22.710 --> 21:25.210
- What if you can't stop them?

21:25.210 --> 21:26.710
- (sighs)

21:37.750 --> 21:41.750
- That was her favorite.

21:41.750 --> 21:46.250
- Deacon, we have to talk.

21:46.250 --> 21:48.920
- About what?
Giving up my girls?

21:57.670 --> 22:02.080
- Here's what's true, Deacon.

22:02.080 --> 22:05.710
You're a musician.
You love music.

22:05.710 --> 22:09.580
And you play the hell out of it.

22:09.580 --> 22:13.540
But you couldn't run Highway 65.
Not on your very best day.

22:13.540 --> 22:17.420
And, of course, you love
the girls, absolutely.

22:17.420 --> 22:20.750
But are you ready to raise
them by yourself,

22:20.750 --> 22:23.170
without Rayna?

22:23.170 --> 22:26.040
Taking care of every little
thing that they need?

22:28.540 --> 22:31.080
I don't think so.

22:31.080 --> 22:33.830
And if this thing's
going to court,

22:33.830 --> 22:36.710
I think any judge will agree.

22:36.710 --> 22:40.040
Now do you really want to put
the girls through this?

for a minute?

23:11.170 --> 23:12.620
Sorry.

23:19.120 --> 23:20.920
- Want some water or something?

23:20.920 --> 23:22.330
- I just need to stop
for a second.

23:22.330 --> 23:24.000
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.670
I can't get a full breath.

23:25.670 --> 23:28.420
- You sounded great.
- I don't feel great.

23:28.420 --> 23:30.080
- Hey, it's wonderful.

23:30.080 --> 23:31.210
- Hey. I didn't know
you were here.

23:31.210 --> 23:32.620
- What's going on?

23:32.620 --> 23:35.290
- Feels like I can't
feel myself.

23:35.290 --> 23:37.960
- Here, come here. Sit down.

23:40.540 --> 23:43.460
- You just started walking.
Take a minute.

23:43.460 --> 23:45.880
- I just feel really off.

23:45.880 --> 23:48.790
- Well, it's only natural.
It's been a while.

23:48.790 --> 23:50.920
- I don't feel--
it's not feeling rusty at all.

23:50.920 --> 23:53.000
I just feel...

23:53.000 --> 23:56.580
like I'm watching myself
from across a room.

23:56.580 --> 23:59.080
Can't feel it in here at all.

24:00.620 --> 24:02.790
- Hey, you will.
I know you.

24:08.460 --> 24:09.500
- Can I help with that?

24:09.500 --> 24:10.920
- No, it's all done.

24:25.580 --> 24:28.420
- I know this is so difficult,
right now.

24:29.960 --> 24:31.580
I just want you to know
that I love you,

24:31.580 --> 24:33.330
and that I'm here for you.

24:33.330 --> 24:34.580
- I love you too.

24:34.580 --> 24:36.290
- I know that we haven't

24:36.290 --> 24:39.000
got to see each other a lot.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.290
But my memories of you
and your sister

24:41.290 --> 24:42.920
are the only thing
that kept me sane

24:42.920 --> 24:45.790
while I've been...
while I've been gone.

24:47.620 --> 24:51.920
Look, your Aunt Tandy, and hey,
we've been talking.

24:51.920 --> 24:53.960
And we think it would be best

24:53.960 --> 24:56.460
if I took care of you and Daphne
because I can.

24:59.580 --> 25:00.710
Hey, Deacon.

25:00.710 --> 25:01.960
- You really are low.

25:01.960 --> 25:03.960
- I'm just telling
her the truth.

25:03.960 --> 25:05.670
- You're trying to manipulate
my daughter, that's what--

25:05.670 --> 25:07.380
- No, no, hold on--I'm not
trying to manipulate--

25:07.380 --> 25:10.420
- Get out. Now, Teddy, get out.

25:10.420 --> 25:14.210
- I was there for her
for 17 years.

25:14.210 --> 25:16.620
And on top of that,
I was never declared a threat

25:16.620 --> 25:21.000
to my daughter
in a court of law!

25:21.000 --> 25:22.380
Are you gonna hit me?

25:22.380 --> 25:24.960
Huh? Is that what
you want to do?

25:40.960 --> 25:44.210
- Maddie, let's go.

25:56.210 --> 25:57.330
- Hi.

25:57.330 --> 26:00.250
- I, um...I got your message.

26:00.250 --> 26:02.250
- I didn't think you'd come.

26:02.250 --> 26:04.330
- Well, I thought that's
what you wanted.

26:04.330 --> 26:07.170
- I didn't really
know what I wanted.

26:16.500 --> 26:17.920
It's really good to see you.

26:17.920 --> 26:20.460
- I've been thinking
about you so much.

26:22.380 --> 26:25.620
And, like, remembering
when my mom died.

26:25.620 --> 26:27.250
I never dealt with it.

26:27.250 --> 26:31.710
People just kept
telling me to be a man.

26:31.710 --> 26:34.210
Whatever that's
supposed to mean.

26:34.210 --> 26:36.670
I just--I figured a man

26:36.670 --> 26:38.960
wasn't supposed to
feel anything.

26:38.960 --> 26:40.420
- You were all alone?

26:40.420 --> 26:43.080
- That's exactly
what I did to you.

26:43.080 --> 26:45.210
I let you down.
- No, you didn't.

26:45.210 --> 26:47.500
I just...

26:47.500 --> 26:51.750
really wanted you to be
my side, that's all.

26:51.750 --> 26:53.790
- Look, I can do that.

26:53.790 --> 26:55.750
Maddie, I can
definitely do that.

26:55.750 --> 27:00.380
- Good, because this
really hurts.

27:09.120 --> 27:11.580
- It's an unusual place
to hold a business meeting.

27:11.580 --> 27:13.750
- Yeah, I like to
change things up.

27:13.750 --> 27:17.500
Art inspires me.

27:17.500 --> 27:20.460
And...this isn't
a business meeting.

27:23.540 --> 27:25.880
- Yeah, I know.

27:25.880 --> 27:27.500
- I'd love to take you
to Berlin sometime.

27:27.500 --> 27:29.500
They have amazing museums.

27:29.500 --> 27:32.670
- (laughs)
You are something else.

27:32.670 --> 27:34.290
- Really?

27:34.290 --> 27:36.420
- Well, I think you
must know that.

27:36.420 --> 27:40.210
People are probably pretty
overwhelmed by you.

27:40.210 --> 27:42.960
- You mean who they think I am.

27:42.960 --> 27:44.750
You know, you have
a surface too.

27:44.750 --> 27:45.920
Would you like
to be judged by it?

27:45.920 --> 27:50.170
Let's see, um...
gorgeous, happy.

27:50.170 --> 27:51.880
Anything going on up there,
though?

27:51.880 --> 27:54.960
- All right, I see your point.

27:54.960 --> 27:59.250
But there is a balance of power
thing happening here

27:59.250 --> 28:01.420
that I'm kind of
uncomfortable with.

28:01.420 --> 28:03.500
- Yeah, I know.
We've established that.

28:03.500 --> 28:06.620
But what's really wrong
with a few perks

28:06.620 --> 28:09.120
if it's easy for me?

28:11.000 --> 28:13.960
- Why do you feel like you
always give people something?

28:13.960 --> 28:16.830
- 'Cause I'm a dweeb.

28:16.830 --> 28:19.250
Okay? I want people to like me.

28:19.250 --> 28:20.750
- I think you're
doing pretty well.

28:20.750 --> 28:22.460
- I'm just being
honest with you.

28:22.460 --> 28:24.750
- (sighs)
I think...

28:33.790 --> 28:35.380
- You think too much, Will.

28:38.790 --> 28:42.830
Every single one of us
knows that we're gonna die.

28:42.830 --> 28:46.290
And armed with that information,

28:46.290 --> 28:48.000
we're supposed to
somehow go on living.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.920
That, my friend, is a reason

28:49.920 --> 28:53.750
to try to go through
life in pairs.

28:53.750 --> 28:55.830
If you go through at all.

29:10.540 --> 29:12.710
- What is it?
- I just listened to my session.

29:12.710 --> 29:14.250
- And?

29:14.250 --> 29:17.580
- So strange to hear me
singing Rayna's song.

29:17.580 --> 29:19.880
- Yeah, I can imagine.

29:19.880 --> 29:24.080
But you are singing it for her.

29:24.080 --> 29:25.830
- I just don't want to
let everybody down.

29:25.830 --> 29:27.580
- Look, Juliette,

29:27.580 --> 29:29.290
this isn't about you
at the end of the day, right?

29:29.290 --> 29:31.790
It's about Rayna.

29:31.790 --> 29:34.000
And as long as you
keep that as your focus,

29:34.000 --> 29:35.250
everything's gonna be fine.

29:40.670 --> 29:42.330
- You have to eat something.

29:42.330 --> 29:44.880
- I never want to eat
another casserole in my life.

29:44.880 --> 29:46.540
- I wish none of this
was happening.

29:46.540 --> 29:50.000
- I know.
It's a lot to deal with.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.460
At first, we have to
get through the CMT tribute

29:51.460 --> 29:52.620
to your mom tomorrow.

29:52.620 --> 29:55.330
- I'm not going.
- Sweetie...

29:55.330 --> 29:57.080
- Why should we have to show
how we feel in public?

29:57.080 --> 30:00.250
- Because your mother meant
the world to so many people.

30:00.250 --> 30:02.330
And it would help them
to see us together

30:02.330 --> 30:03.830
coming out for her.

30:03.830 --> 30:05.290
- She wouldn't make me go.

30:05.290 --> 30:06.790
- But she would want you to.

30:06.790 --> 30:09.290
- You don't know everything
about her, okay?

30:09.290 --> 30:12.250
- Well, maybe not.
But she was my sister.

30:12.250 --> 30:15.960
And we shared things that
only sisters can know about.

30:15.960 --> 30:18.460
And you know what
I'm talking about.

30:20.710 --> 30:22.960
Well, that went well.

30:25.210 --> 30:27.830
- I miss seeing her
in the kitchen.

30:30.500 --> 30:33.000
- You okay, baby?

30:33.000 --> 30:35.170
- Why did Mom have to die?

30:39.330 --> 30:41.420
- I don't know.

30:44.460 --> 30:46.620
Life can be so very beautiful,

30:46.620 --> 30:49.250
and then...really cruel.

30:49.250 --> 30:51.790
It's hard to understand

30:51.790 --> 30:53.330
why some things happen
to some people

30:53.330 --> 30:55.000
and not to others.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.040
- But why are we even alive
if we have to die?

30:59.000 --> 31:02.250
- I believe we are...

31:02.250 --> 31:04.620
we're all here for a reason.

31:04.620 --> 31:08.420
We all got these lights
inside of us.

31:08.420 --> 31:10.420
We've got to let them shine

31:10.420 --> 31:13.750
the best we can
with the time we've got.

31:13.750 --> 31:18.170
And your mama,
she shined so bright.

31:18.170 --> 31:20.960
And the brightest part
of her life

31:20.960 --> 31:22.790
was you and your sister.

31:22.790 --> 31:26.710
She just thought the sun
rose and set in your eyes.

31:26.710 --> 31:30.290
- I don't know how to pick
who my dad's gonna be.

31:30.290 --> 31:32.880
- It's gonna be all right,
sweetheart.

31:32.880 --> 31:34.540
I promise you that
it's gonna be all right.

31:34.540 --> 31:36.880
- No, it's not.
If I choose my dad,

31:36.880 --> 31:38.290
Deacon and Maddie's
gonna hate me.

31:38.290 --> 31:42.170
I choose Deacon,
my dad's gonna hate me.

31:42.170 --> 31:44.830
Either way, I lose.

31:51.330 --> 31:54.210
(music playing)

32:04.170 --> 32:06.790
- Tandy, can you please
take the girls to their seats?

32:06.790 --> 32:09.000
- Sure.
- Be right there.

32:12.830 --> 32:14.920
Can I talk to
you for a second?

32:20.210 --> 32:22.580
These girls are
going through hell.

32:22.580 --> 32:23.920
Anybody can see that.

32:23.920 --> 32:25.620
It's hard enough on 'em as it is

32:25.620 --> 32:26.790
without all this crap
we're putting them through.

32:28.420 --> 32:30.580
See, the thing is,
I feel like their father.

32:30.580 --> 32:32.040
I do.

32:32.040 --> 32:33.620
But we got to put an end to this

32:33.620 --> 32:35.960
for their sake.

32:39.920 --> 32:41.500
Why don't you go ahead
and be the guardian?

32:46.960 --> 32:49.500
- Um...

32:49.500 --> 32:53.250
Thank you, Deacon.
- Yeah.

32:53.250 --> 32:54.580
- Really, I don't know
what to say, just--

32:54.580 --> 32:56.170
- Yeah, thanks.

32:57.880 --> 32:59.580
- Ladies and gentlemen,

32:59.580 --> 33:02.210
welcome to our celebration
of country's very best.

33:02.210 --> 33:04.540
We have a great show
in store for you tonight.

33:04.540 --> 33:06.580
But first, as you all know,

33:06.580 --> 33:08.460
we have lost one of our own.

33:08.460 --> 33:11.040
The incredibly talented
Rayna James.

33:11.040 --> 33:12.920
And I'd like to start out
our tribute tonight

33:12.920 --> 33:14.670
with someone that you all know,

33:14.670 --> 33:17.830
singing, "By Your Side",
Will Lexington.

33:17.830 --> 33:19.170
(applause)

33:23.290 --> 33:25.080
- Thank y'all very much.

33:25.080 --> 33:27.960
This one's for you, Rayna.

I don't think I should do this.

34:15.790 --> 34:17.460
- What?

34:17.460 --> 34:19.420
- You're her daughter.

34:19.420 --> 34:21.670
Who better to sing a tribute
to her than you?

34:21.670 --> 34:23.790
- What do you mean?

34:23.790 --> 34:25.790
- I know.
I wanted this so badly.

34:25.790 --> 34:27.580
And it's supposed to be
my big moment

34:27.580 --> 34:29.830
telling everybody that
I'm back in the game,

34:29.830 --> 34:32.120
but that's not what this is.

34:32.120 --> 34:33.620
This is about your mom.

34:33.620 --> 34:35.920
- I know, and she would
be so happy to know

34:35.920 --> 34:37.830
that you're here for her.

34:37.830 --> 34:40.290
- No, she wouldn't, not really.

34:40.290 --> 34:42.960
- Two minutes.
- Okay.

34:42.960 --> 34:44.380
- I couldn't do it.

34:44.380 --> 34:45.790
- Ms. Barnes?

34:45.790 --> 34:48.000
- Hold onto your shorts!

34:48.000 --> 34:49.920
- I should go back to my seat.
- Are you sure?

34:51.710 --> 34:54.670
- I couldn't.
I mean, what would people think?

34:56.330 --> 34:58.080
- Girl, you will never
start to live your life

34:58.080 --> 35:00.960
until you stop caring
what people think, okay?

35:00.960 --> 35:02.540
How do you feel?

35:02.540 --> 35:05.000
Is there something you want
to say to your mom?

35:05.000 --> 35:06.210
- Ms. Barnes,
we need you right now.

35:08.040 --> 35:09.210
- (sighs)

35:10.830 --> 35:13.170
- It's not my song to sing.
This is yours.

35:13.170 --> 35:14.880

special guest here tonight

35:32.330 --> 35:34.880
that we would like
to welcome back to the stage.

35:34.880 --> 35:37.540
Someone that's been
in our prayers.

35:37.540 --> 35:41.170
Ladies and gentlemen, performing
the Rayna James classic,

35:41.170 --> 35:43.750
"Sanctuary," Juliette Barnes.

35:43.750 --> 35:45.880
(applause)

35:48.420 --> 35:50.120
- Hey, everyone.

35:50.120 --> 35:51.920
Thank you for the warm welcome.

35:51.920 --> 35:54.920
I grew up in a trailer park.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.830
And, yeah, we were poor.

35:56.830 --> 35:59.290
But one thing we did have
was the radio.

35:59.290 --> 36:02.170
And I would listen to it
every night.

36:02.170 --> 36:04.540
Sometimes all night.

36:09.500 --> 36:12.710
And I will never forget

36:12.710 --> 36:15.120
hearing Rayna James
sing for the first time.

36:15.120 --> 36:17.250
Because it felt like
she was singing to me

36:17.250 --> 36:19.210
and nobody else.

36:19.210 --> 36:22.580
She taught me how to dream.

36:22.580 --> 36:25.500
And everyone who knows Rayna

36:25.500 --> 36:28.670
knows that she always
followed her dreams.

36:35.460 --> 36:38.040
And we are so incredibly honored

36:38.040 --> 36:41.250
to have Rayna's daughter,
Maddie, here with us.

36:42.540 --> 36:45.540
Don't be scared, baby girl.

36:45.540 --> 36:47.460
The world loved your mom.

36:47.460 --> 36:49.080
And now the world
just wants to hear

36:49.080 --> 36:50.460
what's in your heart.

36:54.460 --> 36:56.540
Ladies and gentlemen,
I could think of nobody better

36:56.540 --> 36:59.380
to sing this song to Rayna
than her daughter, Maddie.

41:10.670 --> 41:14.460
Look, I appreciate
what you said earlier.

41:14.460 --> 41:17.380
The truth is,
I'm gonna be gone for a while.

41:17.380 --> 41:21.170
And, um...I'd be obliged
if you'd watch over them.

41:21.170 --> 41:23.500
Be their guardian for now.

41:23.500 --> 41:27.420
Maybe when I get back,
we can work something out.

41:29.540 --> 41:32.120
- Hey, they want you
back out there again!

41:38.670 --> 41:41.920
(cheers and applause)
