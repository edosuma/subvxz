00:21.086 --> 00:22.521
I DON'T WANT ANY MONEY.

00:22.588 --> 00:25.357
I JUST WANT A LITTLE SUGAR FROM MY MAN.

00:43.743 --> 00:46.745

OVER YOUR FACE.

SEE ME AGAIN.

01:47.973 --> 01:49.440
CANDIED YAMS?

01:49.508 --> 01:51.209

01:56.115 --> 01:57.565

01:57.633 --> 01:59.234
THEY WERE-
THEY WERE GOOD NEIGHBORS.

01:59.301 --> 02:01.252
THEY REALLY KNEW
HOW TO LEAVE YOU ALONE.

02:01.320 --> 02:04.455
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF THE NEW
NEIGHBORS NOT SPEAKING ENGLISH?

02:04.523 --> 02:06.007
CRAP, YOU'RE RIGHT.

02:06.075 --> 02:08.276
NOW I'M GONNA HAVE TO

02:12.648 --> 02:14.915
NO, NO. WAIT, WAIT,

02:14.983 --> 02:17.751
DEACON AND KELLY ARE
LOOKING FOR A NEW HOUSE.

02:17.819 --> 02:20.688
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THEM
LIVING RIGHT NEXT DOOR?

02:20.755 --> 02:22.089
YOU KNOW WHAT'S WRONG

02:22.158 --> 02:24.992
NOTHING! THAT'S

03:16.678 --> 03:18.229
TOLD YOU THERE WAS
A GREAT VIEW.

03:18.296 --> 03:20.865

03:26.488 --> 03:27.956
I WILL, UH...

03:28.024 --> 03:31.192
POINT OUT EVERYBODY
I HATE FROM THE WINDOW.

03:31.260 --> 03:32.794
I'M TELLIN' YOU,
IT'S FINE

03:32.862 --> 03:35.096
THIS COLOR SCHEME DOESN'T
MATCH ANYTHING WE OWN.

03:35.164 --> 03:36.765
SO WE'LL RE-PAPER.

03:36.832 --> 03:39.934
YEAH, BY "WE"
YOU MEAN ME.

03:40.002 --> 03:41.552
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU GUYS DOING HERE?

03:41.620 --> 03:43.471
WELL, WE HEARD THE PLACE
WAS FOR SALE,

03:43.539 --> 03:46.674
AND WE THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE
THE PERFECT STARTER HOUSE FOR US.

03:46.741 --> 03:48.610
OK, AND JUST TO CHECK
ONE MORE TIME,

03:48.677 --> 03:50.945
YOU TWO AREN'T RAISING
WHITE TIGERS?

03:52.281 --> 03:53.714
DOUG, OPEN YOUR EYES.

03:53.782 --> 03:56.700
A LOT OF YOUNG, STRAIGHT
GUYS BUY HOUSES TOGETHER.

03:56.768 --> 03:58.536
ALL RIGHT, THAT COULDN'T
BE ANY LESS TRUE.

04:00.539 --> 04:03.174
HEY, YOU DIDN'T TELL ME YOUR
NEIGHBOR WAS A FELLOW ALBANIAN, MAN.

04:03.242 --> 04:04.925
WASSILY'S A SWEETHEART.

04:04.993 --> 04:06.711
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

04:06.778 --> 04:08.846
WHAT ARE YOU TWO
DOING HERE?

04:08.914 --> 04:10.565
ME AND SPENCE
ARE THINKING ABOUT

04:10.633 --> 04:13.701
DIPPING OUR TOES
IN THE HOMEOWNER POOL.

04:13.769 --> 04:15.386
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

04:15.453 --> 04:17.555
THIS IS DEACON
AND KELLY'S HOUSE.

04:17.622 --> 04:20.257
WHATEVER FREAKY THING
YOU TWO GOT GOING...

04:20.325 --> 04:22.560
AIN'T HAPPENING HERE,
BUDDY.

04:22.627 --> 04:25.029
EXCUSE ME, CARRIE, ALL RIGHT,
BUT I THINK THIS IS A FREE-

04:25.097 --> 04:28.266
IT ONLY GETS WORSE
FROM HERE. WALK AWAY.

04:29.802 --> 04:32.570
WASSILY, I'M SORRY.
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PASS.

04:32.637 --> 04:34.505
OH, TOO BAD.

04:34.573 --> 04:37.842
BUT GOOD TO MEET A NICE
YOUNG ALBANIAN LIKE YOURSELF.

04:37.910 --> 04:39.927
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY SAY-

04:43.966 --> 04:45.467
VERY GOOD.

04:50.472 --> 04:52.357
THIS IS MY NIECE, ZANA.

04:52.424 --> 04:54.625
SHE JUST CAME
FROM SHKODER.

04:54.693 --> 04:56.377
OH, REALLY? WELL...

05:05.754 --> 05:08.306
HEH, WUZZUP?

05:11.110 --> 05:12.376

YEAH, LISTEN. UH, THIS
PLACE IS GONNA GO FAST,

05:16.498 --> 05:18.432
SO YOU GUYS SHOULD COME
IN RIGHT IN AT ASKING.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.067
OR, YOU KNOW, EVEN LESS
THAN ASKING.

05:20.135 --> 05:21.068
YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO?

05:21.136 --> 05:22.069
WE SHOULD PUT IN A FAKE BID.

05:22.137 --> 05:25.406
<i>OK, THAT WOULD
DRIVE THE PRICE UP.</i>

05:25.474 --> 05:26.574
DO ME A FAVOR.

05:26.642 --> 05:28.842
JUST LEAVE THE REAL
ESTATE STUFF TO ME, OK?

05:28.910 --> 05:29.794
OK, WHY DON'T YOU
LEAVE YOUR ATTITUDE-

05:29.862 --> 05:32.297
GUYS, GUYS, GUYS!

05:33.698 --> 05:35.433
WE'RE GETTING A LITTLE
AHEAD OF OURSELVES HERE.

05:35.501 --> 05:37.335
YEAH, I MEAN, WE'RE
NOT REALLY SURE

05:37.403 --> 05:39.220
THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE FOR US.

05:39.287 --> 05:40.521
WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

05:40.589 --> 05:42.690
IT HAS EVERYTHING
YOU SAID YOU WANTED...

05:42.758 --> 05:45.059
3 BEDROOMS, A HUGE
BACKYARD, SKYLIGHTS.

05:45.126 --> 05:46.527
11/2 CAR GARAGE...

05:46.595 --> 05:49.230
IN CASE YOU GOT A CAR...
AND A HALF.

05:50.699 --> 05:52.117
WELL, YEAH, BUT WE WERE
JUST DOWN IN THE BASEMENT,

05:52.184 --> 05:53.951
AND... YOU KNOW, WE
WERE A LITTLE CONCERNED

05:54.019 --> 05:55.620
ABOUT THE-
THE WATER HEATER.

05:55.687 --> 05:56.954
YEAH!

05:57.022 --> 05:57.989
IT'S NO GOOD.

06:00.526 --> 06:02.961
OH.
OK.

06:03.028 --> 06:04.796
ALL RIGHT,

06:04.864 --> 06:06.164
DON'T WE HAVE TO GO SEE THAT
OTHER HOUSE IN 20 MINUTES?

06:06.231 --> 06:07.248
OH, YEAH.
W- WE BETTER SCOOT.

06:07.315 --> 06:08.299
YEAH.

06:08.366 --> 06:10.034
THANKS AGAIN

06:10.102 --> 06:12.203
YEAH, NO PRO

06:12.270 --> 06:13.604
YEAH, GIVE HER THIS...

06:23.566 --> 06:26.000
YEAH, WELL, WHEN YOU GOTTA
SCOOT, YOU GOTTA SCOOT.

06:26.068 --> 06:27.569
MM-HMM.

06:27.636 --> 06:30.004
EVEN IF IT MEANS
TAKING OUT A MAILBOX.

06:34.843 --> 06:35.577
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT
WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE

06:35.727 --> 06:36.994
TO HAVE THEM
AS NEIGHBORS,

06:37.062 --> 06:40.364
BUT YOU DON'T WANNA MESS
WITH A BAD WATER HEATER.

06:40.432 --> 06:43.000
MM-MMM. NO, YOU DO NOT,
MY FRIEND.

06:43.068 --> 06:46.754
ALTHOUGH, IT'S NOT THAT HARD
TO REPLACE A WATER HEATER...

06:46.822 --> 06:49.974
MM-HMM. BUT THERE'S GOTTA
BE SOME OTHER REASON...

06:56.848 --> 06:58.716
OH, COME ON,
IT'S US!

06:58.783 --> 07:00.552
NO, THERE'S GOTTA BE A MILLION
DIFFERENT THINGS IT COULD HAVE BEEN.

07:00.619 --> 07:01.969
ALL RIGHT,
LIKE WHAT?

07:05.690 --> 07:07.691
I GOT NOTHING. THEY HATE US.

07:07.759 --> 07:09.811
YOU KNOW WHAT? IF THEY DON'T
WANT TO BE OUR NEIGHBORS,

07:09.878 --> 07:11.445
THEN IT'S
THEIR LOSS.

07:11.513 --> 07:12.563
YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU'RE RIGHT!

07:12.631 --> 07:14.198
THEY JUST MISSED OUT
ON THE RIDE OF THEIR LIVES.

07:14.266 --> 07:15.883
YOU ARE SO RIGHT.

07:15.951 --> 07:17.134
SO WHAT'S FOR DINNER?

07:17.202 --> 07:18.486
FISHSTICKS
AND CORN NIBLETS.

07:20.872 --> 07:22.540
NICE. I'M GONNA
TAKE A NAP.

07:30.749 --> 07:31.982
OH, MAN.

07:37.789 --> 07:39.056
HEY, HEY!

07:39.124 --> 07:40.175
TELL HER I SAID, UH...

07:40.242 --> 07:42.009
WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH
COMMERCIALS AT THE MOVIES?

07:47.566 --> 07:48.733
SPENCE...

07:48.801 --> 07:50.668
<i>WHERE IS BAHNAH?</i>

07:50.736 --> 07:51.669
OH, THAT'S BATHROOM.

07:51.737 --> 07:53.504
UH, IT'S RIGHT
OVER THERE.

07:57.926 --> 07:59.377
SO, UH...

07:59.444 --> 08:02.546
YOU WANNA TAKE OFF NOW?

08:02.614 --> 08:04.265
WHAT?
YEAH!

08:04.333 --> 08:07.050
WELL, ZANA
IS CLEARLY DIGGING ME.

08:07.118 --> 08:08.152
SO, UH, WHY DON'T YOU
GO TO A DINER

08:08.220 --> 08:10.421
AND GET YOURSELF AN OPEN
FACED TURKEY SANDWICH?

08:10.489 --> 08:11.622
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO SHOULD GO GET

08:11.690 --> 08:12.790
AN OPEN FACED
TURKEY SANDWICH.

08:12.858 --> 08:14.792
SHE HASN'T SAID ONE
WORD TO YOU ALL NIGHT.

08:14.860 --> 08:16.961
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE I DON'T
UNDERSTAND HER LITTLE LANGUAGE,

08:17.028 --> 08:20.998
BUT, BELIEVE ME, BUDDY.
SPARKS ARE FLYING.

08:21.066 --> 08:22.349
YOU'RE CRAZY!

08:22.417 --> 08:23.217
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:23.284 --> 08:24.802
LET'S LET ZANA SETTLE THIS.

08:24.869 --> 08:26.570
WHEN SHE COMES OUT HERE,
LET'S SEE WHO SHE COMES TO.

08:26.638 --> 08:27.805
OH, OK!

08:45.590 --> 08:46.907
OH... HO, HO.

09:03.024 --> 09:05.126
HEY, MAN. HOW'S IT GOING?

09:05.193 --> 09:06.461
GOOD, JUST...

09:06.528 --> 09:09.930
TRYING TO WORK UP MY
APPETITE FOR SECOND LUNCH.

09:09.998 --> 09:12.950
DON'T WORRY, MAN.
YOU'LL GET THERE.

09:13.018 --> 09:14.302
SO, UH...

09:14.369 --> 09:16.203
HOW'D THAT OTHER
HOUSE WORK OUT?

09:16.271 --> 09:18.139
OH... I-IT WAS NICE...

09:18.207 --> 09:21.075
WE-WE MIGHT PUT
AN OFFER IN ON IT.

09:21.143 --> 09:22.793
WOW, THAT WAS
KIND OF FAST, HUH?

09:22.861 --> 09:25.863
SO I GUESS THE WATER
HEATER CHECKED OUT, HUH?

09:25.930 --> 09:28.165
YEAH. YEAH, YEAH,
IT SEEMED FINE.

09:28.233 --> 09:29.483
COOL!

09:29.551 --> 09:31.368
YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT,
I- I'M GONNA HEAD BACK OUT-

09:31.436 --> 09:33.137
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M A BIG BOY, ALL RIGHT?

09:33.205 --> 09:35.672
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO LIVE
NEXT DOOR TO ME, JUST SAY IT.

09:36.291 --> 09:37.875
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
THE THING IS-

09:37.943 --> 09:40.311
NO, NO, NO! I CHANGED
MY MIND. DON'T SAY IT.

09:40.379 --> 09:41.379
DON'T GET ALL CRAZY, HERE.

09:41.447 --> 09:43.614
LOOK, IT'S NOT YOU.

09:44.766 --> 09:46.367
IT'S CARRIE.

09:46.435 --> 09:47.785
CARRIE?

09:47.853 --> 09:50.120
YOU DON'T WANT TO LIVE
NEXT DOOR TO CARRIE?

09:53.225 --> 09:55.226
YES!

09:57.729 --> 10:00.764
NOW IT ALL
MAKES SENSE!

10:00.832 --> 10:01.999
WELL, DON'T GET ME WRONG.
I MEAN, CARRIE'S GREAT,

10:02.067 --> 10:04.035
BUT SOMETIMES, SHE CAN BE-

10:04.103 --> 10:06.203
A LITTLE ANNOYING.

10:06.271 --> 10:08.673
OH, YOU SHOULD SEE HER BEFORE
SHE'S HAD HER COFFEE, YOU KNOW.

10:08.740 --> 10:11.308
LUCIFER!
IT'S CRAZY, YEAH.

10:11.376 --> 10:13.361
ANYWAY, I-I-I'M SORRY
ABOUT ALL THIS.

10:13.429 --> 10:14.362
DON'T BE!

10:14.430 --> 10:16.096
YOU KNOW, HEY,
I'M SORRY.

10:16.164 --> 10:18.349
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE
BELIEVE ME, WE LOVE CARRIE.

10:18.417 --> 10:21.185
OH, YEAH. ME, TOO.
I DO, TOO, YOU KNOW.

10:21.253 --> 10:22.286
I MEAN, WE THINK
HE'S GREAT,

10:22.354 --> 10:24.154
BUT A LITTLE DOUG
GOES A LONG WAY.

10:26.057 --> 10:28.575
HEY. PREACHER, CHOIR.

10:29.677 --> 10:30.944
SOMETIMES WHEN
I PULL UP TO THE HOUSE,

10:31.013 --> 10:31.945

10:56.288 --> 10:58.088
ABOUT THE WHOLE
HOUSE THING.

10:58.156 --> 10:59.924
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

10:59.992 --> 11:04.378
<i>TURNS OUT THAT ACTUALLY
IT WAS THE WATER HEATER!</i>

11:04.446 --> 11:05.596
WELL, THERE YOU GO!

11:05.664 --> 11:08.299

OH, ALL RIGHT. WELL,

12:01.203 --> 12:02.169
THIS IS TAVE KOSI,

12:02.237 --> 12:04.105
THE NATIONAL DISH

12:05.340 --> 12:07.992
SO? GUY CAN'T HAVE
SOME BAKED LAMB AND YOGURT

12:08.060 --> 12:10.228

12:10.295 --> 12:11.762
WAIT A MINUTE...

12:13.665 --> 12:15.382
WHERE IS THE LIBRARY?

12:18.319 --> 12:19.503
THIS ISN'T BILLY OCEAN.

12:19.571 --> 12:21.972
YOU'RE LEARNING
CONVERSATIONAL ALBANIAN!

12:22.040 --> 12:23.040

12:54.873 --> 12:56.140
WAIT, WAIT, WHAT ABOUT
THE HOT DOG BUNS?

12:56.207 --> 12:58.208
DOUG, JUST GET INSIDE!

12:59.945 --> 13:01.478
I CAN'T. I JUST MADE
EYE CONTACT.

13:01.546 --> 13:03.647
WHY DO YOU GOTTA

13:03.715 --> 13:04.748
HEY!

13:04.816 --> 13:06.517
HEY!

13:07.552 --> 13:09.453

13:09.521 --> 13:12.023
WELL, IN ABOUT
30 YEARS WE ARE.

13:12.090 --> 13:14.158
I HEAR THAT. DOUG AND CARRIE HEFFERNAN.

13:14.226 --> 13:16.294
JEFF O'LEARY.
MY WIFE, STEPHANIE.

13:16.361 --> 13:17.561
HI, DOUG. HI, CARRIE. HI.

13:17.629 --> 13:20.047
HEY, DID YOU ROB
A PLAYGROUND?

13:20.115 --> 13:21.899
NO, NO, NO!
THEY'RE ALL OURS.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.083
THE REST ARE IN THE HOUSE.

13:23.151 --> 13:24.918
THE REST? HOW MANY
DO YOU HAVE?

13:24.986 --> 13:26.754
WE'VE GOT 8.
YEAH.

13:26.822 --> 13:28.005
8?!

13:28.073 --> 13:30.474
HOW ARE YOU
ABLE TO WALK?

13:30.541 --> 13:34.611
3 WERE MINE, 3 WERE
JEFF'S, AND WE ADOPTED...

13:34.679 --> 13:35.913
CHI LONG AND TESSA.

13:35.981 --> 13:36.948
SO, YOU GUYS HAVE
ANY CHILDREN?

13:37.015 --> 13:38.115
ONE.

13:38.183 --> 13:41.953
OLD MAN. WE-
WE HAVE AN OLD MAN.

13:42.020 --> 13:43.420
OH.

13:43.488 --> 13:45.923
WHOA! SLOW IT DOWN
THERE, SPEEDY.

13:45.991 --> 13:47.091
I'LL GIVE YOU
A TICKET!

13:51.196 --> 13:52.330
SO, UH...

13:52.397 --> 13:53.214
YOU THINK
THIS HOUSE

13:53.281 --> 13:55.232
IS BIG ENOUGH
FOR YOU GUYS?

13:55.300 --> 13:57.501
WE ALWAYS SAY,
LOVE FINDS A WAY.

13:57.568 --> 13:59.069
PLUS WE'RE ADDING
A THIRD STORY.

13:59.137 --> 14:01.605
AND IT BETTER
GET DONE FAST, 'CAUSE...

14:01.673 --> 14:03.341
WE'RE PREGNANT!

14:34.840 --> 14:38.275
WOW, THEY REALLY GOT THAT
CONSTRUCTION CREW WORKING LATE, HUH?

14:38.343 --> 14:40.211
ACTUALLY, IT'S PEOPLE
FROM THEIR CHURCH.

14:41.612 --> 14:44.715
THEY COME IN SHIFTS.

14:44.782 --> 14:47.685
IT'S LIKE THE AMISH
WITH POWER TOOLS.

14:49.571 --> 14:51.338
IF IT WASN'T FOR HIM,

14:51.406 --> 14:53.574
I'D BE LIVING NEXT
TO DEACON AND KELLY NOW,

14:53.641 --> 14:55.376
INSTEAD
OF THE FREAKIN' OSMONDS.

14:57.879 --> 14:59.529
SHE RUINS
EVERYTHING FOR ME.

15:01.132 --> 15:03.934
I SHOULD'VE LISTENED TO MY
FRIENDS AND MARRIED PAUL.

15:04.002 --> 15:06.670
EVERYBODY LOVED HIM.

15:06.738 --> 15:09.356
IF ONLY SHE MARRIED PAUL,

15:09.424 --> 15:12.292
THEN IT'D JUST BE ME,
DEACON, AND KELLY.

15:13.095 --> 15:15.378
LISTEN, TOMORROW
I MIGHT BE LATE,

15:15.446 --> 15:17.765
BECAUSE, UH, THEY'RE
SWITCHING ROUTES ON ME,

15:17.832 --> 15:19.216
FROM NORTHERN BOULEVARD
TO LEFRAK.

15:19.283 --> 15:21.117
IT'S FEWER STOPS, BUT
IT'S A LOT MORE TRAFFIC...

15:21.185 --> 15:24.338
ANOTHER DRIVING STORY.

15:24.405 --> 15:25.706
ANY GUN SHOPS
ON YOUR ROUTE,

15:25.774 --> 15:27.474
'CAUSE I'D LIKE TO PUT
A BULLET IN MY HEAD.

15:27.542 --> 15:28.876
...LIKE 71st STREET
ALL THE WAY TO THE BRIDGE.

15:28.944 --> 15:29.977
I MADE IT NO SWEAT.

15:30.045 --> 15:31.362
MORE POTATOES, BABY?

15:31.430 --> 15:32.729
OH, OK.

15:32.797 --> 15:33.814
PIG.

15:36.885 --> 15:39.069
I HATE HER FACE.

15:47.562 --> 15:50.030
OH, MY GOD.
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

15:50.098 --> 15:51.665
DOUG, WAKE UP.

15:53.268 --> 15:55.836
<i>DOUG, WAKE UP!
OW! GOD.</i>

15:55.903 --> 15:57.938
HOW ARE YOU SLEEPING
THROUGH THIS NOISE?

15:58.006 --> 15:59.440
'CAUSE NO ONE
WAS PINCHING ME.

15:59.508 --> 16:02.376
HONEY, GO OVER THERE AND TELL
THEM TO KEEP IT DOWN, PLEASE.

16:02.444 --> 16:04.378
WHY CAN'T YOU?

16:04.446 --> 16:05.379
'CAUSE LAST TIME
I CHECKED,

16:05.447 --> 16:07.581
YOU WERE THE MAN
OF THE HOUSE.

16:07.649 --> 16:10.017
LAST TIME YOU CHECKED WAS
ABOUT 3 WEEKS AGO, SO WHY-

16:10.084 --> 16:11.268
JUST GO.
ALL RIGHT!

16:17.742 --> 16:20.510
HEY, IS YOUR, UH,
YOUR DAD AROUND?

16:20.578 --> 16:22.863
WANNA SEE ME DO
A CARTWHEEL?

16:22.931 --> 16:24.999
NO, I'M GOOD.
JUST GET DADDY.

16:35.627 --> 16:36.927
HEY!

16:36.995 --> 16:39.546
OH, OK. VERY FUNNY, GUYS,
OK? YOU GOT ME.

16:39.613 --> 16:41.215
NOW-NOW, COOL IT, OK?

16:41.282 --> 16:43.183
ALL RIGHT?

16:43.251 --> 16:43.917
HEY, HEY, I SAID COOL IT,

16:43.985 --> 16:45.836
OR THERE'S GONNA BE
BIG TROUBLE!

16:45.904 --> 16:47.537
YOU'RE FAT!

16:48.272 --> 16:50.891
OH? YEAH, WELL,
YOU'RE ADOPTED.

16:53.061 --> 16:54.328
AH! HEY!

16:57.698 --> 17:00.333
AH, TRY AND GET ME NOW!
HA HA HA!

17:02.053 --> 17:03.154
OH, NICE TRY,
PUNKY BREWSTER,

17:03.221 --> 17:04.855
BUT YOU'RE A LITTLE LATE.

17:23.241 --> 17:26.009
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET WHEN
YOU MESS WITH THE BIG DOG!

17:26.077 --> 17:27.594
HA HA HA HA!

17:45.129 --> 17:46.263
WHY AM I STILL
HEARING NOISE?

17:46.331 --> 17:49.566
THEY TRIED TO KILL ME
WITH AN AIRPLANE.

17:49.633 --> 17:51.801
AGAIN, WHY AM I
STILL HEARING NOISE?

17:51.870 --> 17:53.636
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU WANT 'EM TO
BE QUIET, YOU TAKE CARE OF IT.

17:53.704 --> 17:55.672
YOU'RE THE REASON THEY'RE
LIVING THERE ANYWAY.

17:55.740 --> 17:56.840
WHAT?

17:56.908 --> 17:57.491
DEACON AND KELLY
DIDN'T TAKE THE PLACE

17:57.558 --> 17:58.842
BECAUSE OF YOU.

17:58.910 --> 18:01.128
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

18:01.196 --> 18:03.664
THAT'S RIGHT. YOU'RE
THE WATER HEATER, BABY.

18:06.834 --> 18:10.537
<i>NO, THEY WERE DYING TO
LIVE NEXT DOOR TO ME.</i>

18:10.605 --> 18:12.372
YOU'RE
THE WATER HEATER.

18:12.440 --> 18:13.974
NOW THAT'S THE WATER HEATER
CALLING THE WATER HEATER

18:14.041 --> 18:15.642
A WATER HEATER.
OK.

18:15.710 --> 18:17.177
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:17.245 --> 18:18.445
I TALKED TO KELLY.

18:18.513 --> 18:20.214
YEAH, WELL,
I TALKED TO DEACON!

18:23.751 --> 18:26.386
WHAT KIND OF SICK GAME
ARE THEY PLAYING?

18:37.932 --> 18:39.633
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

18:39.701 --> 18:43.036
ZANA AND I ARE
GOING FOLK DANCING.

18:43.104 --> 18:44.304
NO WAY.

18:44.372 --> 18:46.640
ZANA AND I ARE BAKING
SWEET BREAD TONIGHT.

18:46.708 --> 18:47.674
YEAH.

18:47.742 --> 18:49.643
SHE'S GONNA PASS UP
THESE MOVES-

18:53.548 --> 18:55.148
FOR BREAD?

18:57.385 --> 18:58.852
LET'S SETTLE THIS
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.237
YEAH, LET'S DO IT.
ALL RIGHT.

19:00.305 --> 19:02.139
HI!
HEY!

19:02.207 --> 19:04.507
UH...

19:04.575 --> 19:06.076

19:13.851 --> 19:16.487
HE IS...
LIKE YOU.

19:16.554 --> 19:17.821
WH-WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:17.888 --> 19:19.756
HOW DO YOU SAY? UM...

19:19.824 --> 19:22.259
THE GAY.

19:23.178 --> 19:24.227
THE GAY?!

19:24.296 --> 19:26.129
WE'RE NOT THE GAY.

19:26.197 --> 19:29.900
BUT YOU LOOK FOR HOUSE
TOGETHER, I MEAN, DO MATH.

19:29.968 --> 19:32.536
NOW I MUST GO. I HAVE
DATE WITH A DRUMMER.

19:42.546 --> 19:44.448
HEY, GUYS.
WHAT A NICE SURPRI-

19:44.515 --> 19:46.316
OH, SAVE IT!

19:47.852 --> 19:49.119
WHAT UP?

19:49.187 --> 19:50.521
WHAT UP? YOUR
LITTLE WEB OF LIES,

19:50.588 --> 19:52.289
THAT WHAT UP.

19:52.357 --> 19:53.907
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

19:53.975 --> 19:54.891
YEAH, WHY DIDN'T
YOU WANT THE HOUSE?

19:54.959 --> 19:56.293
IS IT ME, IS IT HIM,
IS IT BOTH OF US? WHAT?

19:56.361 --> 19:58.161
YEAH, WE'RE NOT LEAVING
HERE UNTIL WE GET AN ANSWER.

19:58.229 --> 20:00.130
LOOK, WE TOLD YOU ALL THAT STUFF,

20:00.198 --> 20:03.033
'CAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT TO
TELL YOU THE REAL REASON.

20:03.101 --> 20:04.134
THE TRUTH IS...

20:04.202 --> 20:07.004
WE'VE BEEN... HAVING
SOME PROBLEMS AGAIN.

20:08.456 --> 20:10.157
YOU MEAN, LIKE,
MARRIAGE STUFF?

20:10.225 --> 20:11.475
YEAH.

20:11.543 --> 20:12.976
I'M SORRY.

20:13.044 --> 20:14.344
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL US?

20:14.412 --> 20:16.680
WE DIDN'T WANT
TO BURDEN YOU.

20:16.747 --> 20:19.116
ANYWAYS, WITH, UH,
ALL THAT GOING ON,

20:19.184 --> 20:20.284
IT'S NOT
THE GREATEST IDEA

20:20.352 --> 20:21.751
FOR US TO BE BUYING
A HOUSE, RIGHT NOW.

20:21.819 --> 20:23.653
AT LEAST, NOT TILL HE
GETS HIS ACT TOGETHER.

20:23.721 --> 20:25.356
HEY, WE BOTH
GOT WORK TO DO.

20:25.423 --> 20:26.473
OK, LOOK, LISTEN...

20:26.541 --> 20:28.242
WE'RE GONNA GET
GOING.

20:28.310 --> 20:30.110
JUST-JUST
KNOW THAT WE'RE...

20:30.178 --> 20:32.146
WE'RE JUST
A PHONE CALL AWAY.

20:32.213 --> 20:33.780
Yeah.

20:35.049 --> 20:36.182
THANKS, MAN.

20:40.137 --> 20:42.606
SEE, I KNEW
SOMETHING WAS UP.

20:42.674 --> 20:43.974
IT'S A SHAME.

20:44.041 --> 20:45.576
EVERYBODY DOESN'T
HAVE WHAT WE HAVE, HUH?

20:45.643 --> 20:46.777
YEAH. LOVE YOU.

20:46.845 --> 20:47.911
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

20:47.979 --> 20:49.747

20:49.814 --> 20:51.181
SO WHAT ARE
WE GONNA TELL 'EM

20:51.249 --> 20:53.283
WHEN WE BUY THAT OTHER HOUSE TOMORROW?

20:53.351 --> 20:55.519
WHO CARES?
IT'S NOT NEXT TO THEM.

21:11.603 --> 21:12.302
STOP TRYING
