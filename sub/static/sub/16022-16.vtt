WEBVTT

00:04.471 --> 00:06.405
(siren wailing)

00:06.407 --> 00:09.041
So, which one
is your favorite?

00:09.043 --> 00:10.642
Got to go with
<i>jailhouse rock.</i>

00:10.644 --> 00:12.411
But <i>blue hawaii's</i>
<i>right up there.</i>

00:12.413 --> 00:14.313
Yeah.
How about you?

00:14.315 --> 00:17.282
Well, it's
a little obscure,

00:17.284 --> 00:19.585
But I'd have to say that
my favorite elvis movie

00:19.587 --> 00:21.553
Is definitely
<i>change of habit.</i>

00:21.555 --> 00:23.155
There's just something
about mary tyler moore

00:23.157 --> 00:24.723
Dressed as a nun.

00:24.725 --> 00:26.125
Yeah, I can see that.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.192
Sidle:
Hey, guys.

00:28.261 --> 00:30.129
Wow.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.663
Viva las vegas.

00:31.665 --> 00:35.067
Yeah, minus the "viva."
no encore for this guy.

00:35.069 --> 00:36.101
Do we have a name?

00:36.103 --> 00:38.137
George tabin.
Business card says

00:38.139 --> 00:39.805
He's an elvis tribute artist.

00:39.807 --> 00:41.140
Cash is still there.

00:41.142 --> 00:42.441
Credit cards, too.

00:42.443 --> 00:43.575
Rules out robbery.

00:46.179 --> 00:48.180
Looks like multiple head wounds.

00:48.182 --> 00:50.315
No blood on the bench.

00:50.317 --> 00:52.618
No blood pool on the ground.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.820
No, this was definitely
not the primary.

00:54.822 --> 00:56.555
He was killed somewhere else,
brought here,

00:56.557 --> 00:57.823
Propped up on the bench,

00:57.825 --> 00:59.792
And staged.

00:59.794 --> 01:01.293
I've got
gravitational blood drops

01:01.295 --> 01:03.729
Over here heading
away from the body.

01:03.731 --> 01:07.466
Maybe from the weapon?

01:07.468 --> 01:08.567
Well, looks
like a trail.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.636
Nice night
for a stroll.

01:19.479 --> 01:23.148
Well, end of the blood trail.

01:23.150 --> 01:24.583
No murder weapon,

01:24.585 --> 01:28.187
But looks like
we have another victim.

01:29.155 --> 01:31.256
It's been stabbed.

01:32.192 --> 01:35.127
There has to be a connection.

01:35.129 --> 01:37.429
Maybe the killer
is making a reference

01:37.431 --> 01:39.264
To edgar allen poe.

01:39.266 --> 01:40.732
Well, then he needs
to brush up on his birds.

01:40.734 --> 01:42.234
This isn't a raven,
it's a rook.

01:42.236 --> 01:45.337
You see the white skin
around its beak?

01:46.873 --> 01:49.174
A rook?

01:49.176 --> 01:50.843
Well, the weird thing
though is rooks are

01:50.845 --> 01:53.345
Indigenous to central
europe and asia.

01:53.347 --> 01:55.280
What's one doing
in southern nevada?

01:55.282 --> 01:57.349
I think I made the connection.

01:57.351 --> 01:59.785
Between a bird and an
elvis impersonator?

01:59.787 --> 02:02.754
No, between a rook...

02:02.756 --> 02:04.590
And a king.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.758
As in, they're both
chess pieces.

02:06.760 --> 02:09.161
As in,
whoever our killer is

02:09.163 --> 02:11.530
Has a sick sense of humor.

02:18.304 --> 02:21.306
♪ who... Are you?

02:21.308 --> 02:24.209
♪ who, who, who, who?

02:24.211 --> 02:27.412
♪ who... Are you?

02:27.414 --> 02:28.780
♪ who, who, who, who?

02:28.782 --> 02:31.316
♪ I really wanna know

02:31.318 --> 02:33.685
♪ who... Are you?

02:33.687 --> 02:35.387
♪ oh-oh-oh
♪ <i>who...</i> ♪

02:35.389 --> 02:39.258
♪ come on, tell me who are you,
you, you ♪

02:39.260 --> 02:41.326
♪ are you!

02:51.271 --> 02:54.306
Lost or lost
in your thoughts?

02:54.308 --> 02:57.276
Avenue d and 1st.

02:57.278 --> 02:58.777
D1.

02:58.779 --> 03:02.447
We found the king
at avenue c and 1st.

03:02.449 --> 03:03.882
<i>C1.</i>

03:03.884 --> 03:05.317
Now I'm lost.

03:05.319 --> 03:08.387
We're looking for
the primary, right?

03:14.194 --> 03:16.495
Where are we going?

03:19.966 --> 03:23.802
Uh, you want
to fill me in, or...?

03:23.804 --> 03:26.438
The squares of a
chessboard are delineated

03:26.440 --> 03:27.940
By letters and numbers.

03:27.942 --> 03:30.976
Avenue e and
1st street-- e1.

03:30.978 --> 03:34.546
Now, there is a chess move
known as "castling."

03:34.548 --> 03:36.982
<i>The player moves</i>
<i>two pieces at the same time.</i>

03:36.984 --> 03:39.851
<i>The rook from its</i>
<i>original position to d1,</i>

03:39.853 --> 03:43.822
<i>And the king from e1 to c1.</i>

03:43.824 --> 03:46.625
From avenue e and 1st street
to avenue c and 1st street.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.760
We are in the alphabets.

03:48.762 --> 03:50.629
Um, greg,
I-I know you were captain

03:50.631 --> 03:53.765
Of your high school chess team,
and-and I respect your instincts

03:53.767 --> 03:56.335
As a criminalist immensely...
But you think I'm reaching.

03:57.638 --> 04:00.839
Actually, I-I think
you're a genius.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.574
Memphis or bust?

04:02.576 --> 04:04.843
Graceland's in memphis, right?

04:04.845 --> 04:06.912
Yeah.

04:10.583 --> 04:13.018
(groans)

04:13.020 --> 04:14.753
There is a significant
amount of blood spatter

04:14.755 --> 04:16.722
In the driver's seat.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.423
I think we just found
our primary.

04:20.493 --> 04:22.728
Maybe he wanted us to find
the king's carriage as well.

04:22.730 --> 04:26.598
Even threw in the murder weapon.

04:28.501 --> 04:30.869
So, doc, word
on the street is...

04:30.871 --> 04:32.037
If you say,

04:32.039 --> 04:33.305
"the king is dead,"

04:33.307 --> 04:34.806
I will kick you
right out of here.

04:34.808 --> 04:38.610
I've already had my fill of
bad elvis puns from david.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.012
So hard to resist.

04:40.014 --> 04:41.546
Yes, I'm sure.

04:41.548 --> 04:44.283
Okay, c.O.D. Is multiple

04:44.285 --> 04:45.784
Craniocerebral injuries

04:45.786 --> 04:48.020
Due to the blunt force
trauma to the head.

04:48.022 --> 04:49.888
Consistent with
the tire iron we found.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.490
Didn't have any prints on it.

04:51.492 --> 04:54.459
Well, he was struck at
least a dozen times.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.795
Suggests rage.
With a twist.

04:56.797 --> 05:00.632
The tox screen flagged
diphenhydramine in his system.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.067
Wow, at these levels,

05:02.069 --> 05:04.569
Even the real elvis
would've been unconscious.

05:04.571 --> 05:06.738
Yes. There, uh...

05:06.740 --> 05:09.474
Was no pill residue in
his gastric contents,

05:09.476 --> 05:11.877
But I found this.

05:11.879 --> 05:14.346
An injection site.

05:14.348 --> 05:16.782
So, he was drugged
before he was beaten to death.

05:16.784 --> 05:19.551
Premeditation,
careful planning.

05:19.553 --> 05:22.888
Well, that's very
astute of you.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.423
(imitating elvis):
Thank you very much.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.458
Out. Get out.

05:29.529 --> 05:31.530
I know you're a fan
of fungi,

05:31.532 --> 05:33.532
But are you also a fan
of nonvascular plants?

05:33.534 --> 05:35.534
Specifically bryophyta?

05:35.536 --> 05:38.537
Well, if it helps us
catch a killer, yes.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.005
<i>I found</i>
<i>what I thought was a hair</i>

05:40.007 --> 05:42.541
<i>On the king's jumpsuit.</i>

05:42.543 --> 05:44.376
<i>Didn't match our vic,</i>
<i>so I ran it.</i>

05:44.378 --> 05:46.078
And you found out
that it was moss.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.079
Yes.

05:47.081 --> 05:48.113
In this case,

05:48.115 --> 05:50.015
A small, but mighty variety

05:50.017 --> 05:53.552
Capable of consuming 20%
of its own weight in fluids.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.587
Sounds like my college roommate.

05:55.589 --> 05:58.023
It's a little
strange, isn't it?

05:58.025 --> 06:00.092
I mean, you can't grow moss
in vegas; it's a desert.

06:00.094 --> 06:01.493
You need moisture.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.595
I found traces
of sodium lauryl sulfate

06:03.597 --> 06:05.530
And shea butter on the stem.

06:05.532 --> 06:08.500
Those are commonly found
in shampoos and bath oils.

06:08.502 --> 06:09.468
I give up.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.636
Where's this moss from?

06:11.638 --> 06:14.106
Not to shill
for the mediterranean hotel,

06:14.108 --> 06:16.508
<i>But they recently installed</i>
<i>live-moss bath mats</i>

06:16.510 --> 06:18.009
<i>In all of their rooms.</i>

06:18.011 --> 06:20.979
Part of an
"environmental chic" design.

06:20.981 --> 06:23.382
Now, I checked.
Our elvis impersonator is

06:23.384 --> 06:25.117
Persona non grata
at the mediterranean,

06:25.119 --> 06:26.985
But perhaps our killer isn't.

06:26.987 --> 06:29.588
Bit of a long shot,
don't you think?

06:29.590 --> 06:31.089
Not if I told you
that the mediterranean

06:31.091 --> 06:34.493
Is currently hosting an
international chess tournament.

06:34.495 --> 06:35.594
Ah.

06:39.532 --> 06:42.434
Woman (over p.A.): Welcome to
the king's crown tournament.

06:42.436 --> 06:45.637
All players, please show
your uscm I.D. Cards

06:45.639 --> 06:46.838
At the registration desk.

06:48.174 --> 06:50.142
Hi.

06:50.144 --> 06:51.543
Man: Check.
Man 2: Damn it.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.481
(laughs)

06:56.483 --> 06:57.916
Come on, man.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.651
You really think
that one of these guys

06:59.653 --> 07:01.420
Took a tire iron
to the king?

07:01.422 --> 07:02.954
Sanders:
What?

07:02.956 --> 07:04.556
Too nerdy to kill?

07:04.558 --> 07:06.491
Well, yeah. I mean,
look at them.

07:06.493 --> 07:09.561
I doubt if half of these guys
could even hold a tire iron

07:09.563 --> 07:11.563
Over their head,
much less swing it.

07:11.565 --> 07:14.599
Chess is by definition

07:14.601 --> 07:18.503
A sequence of captures,
ambushes, sacrifices

07:18.505 --> 07:19.504
And attacks.

07:19.506 --> 07:21.940
It's violence played out.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.709
Uh, no, I think it's
just a board game.

07:24.711 --> 07:26.144
Lvpd?

07:26.146 --> 07:27.512
Yes.

07:27.514 --> 07:29.614
I'm jenny carroll, the
tournament director.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.516
I believe I spoke with
one of you on the phone.

07:31.518 --> 07:33.552
That would be me.
I'm csi sanders.
Hi.

07:33.554 --> 07:34.820
Csi stokes.
Thank you for your time.

07:34.822 --> 07:36.621
We just want to ask you
a few questions, okay?

07:36.623 --> 07:38.557
What about?

07:38.559 --> 07:40.926
Well, actually,
it's about a homicide.

07:40.928 --> 07:43.195
A homicide connected
to the festival?

07:43.197 --> 07:47.966
That this tournament is
part of a promotional tour?

07:47.968 --> 07:51.503
Yes, we are trying to broaden
the appeal of the game.

07:51.505 --> 07:52.804
Just make it sexier.

07:52.806 --> 07:56.475
You might want to try getting
a few more women in the joint.

07:56.477 --> 07:57.909
(laughs)
oh, I agree.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.678
Chess has been
pretty much a man's game.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.713
It would be nice to open it up.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.748
Can't say I disagree
with that.

08:04.884 --> 08:07.886
Uh, excuse me.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.554
Stokes:
He, uh...

08:09.556 --> 08:11.723
He played chess in high school;
he-he gets really excited.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.959
Check.

08:21.168 --> 08:24.803
I should've known
that you would've been here.

08:24.805 --> 08:25.737
Hey, do you mind?

08:26.706 --> 08:28.106
Man's an old friend.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.541
A player once, too.

08:29.543 --> 08:30.609
Well, if that's the case,

08:30.611 --> 08:33.078
To show some respect
for the game.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.780
People should show
respect period.

08:39.752 --> 08:42.254
We're done.

08:42.256 --> 08:44.890
He's, uh... Intense.

08:44.892 --> 08:47.859
From the looks of it,
he had already lost anyways.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.662
I assume you're not here
for the tournament.

08:51.731 --> 08:53.932
I'm sorry, I still
can't believe

08:53.934 --> 08:56.535
Anyone here would be
involved in murder.

08:56.537 --> 08:59.070
Well, I've seen
stranger things.

08:59.072 --> 09:02.974
So, how long is
the tournament in town?

09:02.976 --> 09:06.211
Since Monday. We're on the
eighth stop of a 12-city tour.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.213
Stokes: And how many
players do you have?

09:08.215 --> 09:10.215
150 signed up in vegas.

09:10.217 --> 09:13.752
I'm gonna need
a list of all their names.

09:13.754 --> 09:16.688
Including a list
of all your vendors.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.056
Quite frankly,
anything associated

09:18.058 --> 09:19.758
With the chess tour, okay?

09:19.760 --> 09:21.560
Okay, sure.

09:21.562 --> 09:23.628
I-I still think you're looking
in the wrong place,

09:23.630 --> 09:24.763
But whatever you need.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.298
Who is this guy?

09:26.300 --> 09:27.632
What's going on over here?

09:27.634 --> 09:29.301
It's called a "simul."

09:29.303 --> 09:32.170
Um, man in the middle is
former champion karl schrute.

09:32.172 --> 09:33.972
He's playing against
everyone seated.

09:33.974 --> 09:35.674
He's playing
everybody at once?

09:35.676 --> 09:36.675
Yeah, he's our
star attraction.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.577
Ah, that's
a pretty cool trick.

09:38.579 --> 09:41.146
Amateurs come from all over
to play against him.

09:41.148 --> 09:42.681
So, former champ.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.082
Has anyone ever
beat him doing that?

09:44.084 --> 09:45.650
Never.

09:45.652 --> 09:47.319
What about you?

09:47.321 --> 09:49.220
Looks like you could
beat him pretty easy.

09:49.222 --> 09:51.323
Okay, I'll start working
on that list.
(laughs)

09:51.325 --> 09:53.592
Okay.

09:58.764 --> 10:01.866
Man:
<i>"chess freak kills the king."</i>

10:01.868 --> 10:04.269
Would certainly make
for a great headline.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.671
Maybe I <i>can</i> see it.

10:06.673 --> 10:08.707
At first, the game
gets in your blood.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.642
Then it gets in your head.

10:11.777 --> 10:13.745
It can drive you to madness.

10:15.781 --> 10:18.149
Any idea who you're looking for?

10:18.151 --> 10:20.685
I've already told you
everything I can tell you, max.

10:20.687 --> 10:25.991
Day you told me you were
turning your back on the game.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.659
(sighs)

10:27.661 --> 10:29.894
It's good to see you again, max.

10:29.896 --> 10:32.364
Good to be seen.

10:32.366 --> 10:34.633
(timer ticking)

10:39.105 --> 10:41.139
Sidle: Nick got a list
of all the participants

10:41.141 --> 10:43.141
And the vendors
at the king's crown.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.910
There are a lot of names
to go through.

10:45.912 --> 10:48.079
Let's pull people
from day shift and swing.

10:48.081 --> 10:51.383
You know,
if you want to play by yourself,

10:51.385 --> 10:54.786
Yeah. Actually, do me a favor.
Come here.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.788
Sit down for a sec.

10:59.258 --> 11:02.794
Take a look at the white pieces.
Tell me what you see.

11:04.163 --> 11:05.397
Looks like you castled
your king.

11:05.399 --> 11:07.399
On the queen's side,
just like the killer.

11:07.401 --> 11:09.401
But what else?

11:11.037 --> 11:14.172
Sidle: <i>You moved your pawns,</i>
<i>your knight,</i>

11:14.174 --> 11:16.007
<i>The bishop and the queen.</i>

11:16.009 --> 11:19.744
If you want to castle,
you have to move those pieces.

11:19.746 --> 11:22.914
Because castling
can't be an opening move.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.984
Which means if the killer
is following the rules,

11:25.986 --> 11:28.820
Our elvis impersonator
would not be his first kill.

11:28.822 --> 11:31.756
And if that's true, then our job
just got a lot harder.

11:31.758 --> 11:34.325
We're not just looking
for a suspect,

11:34.327 --> 11:36.394
We're looking
for more victims.

11:37.463 --> 11:39.264
Hey.
Hey.

11:39.266 --> 11:40.732
Oh, sorry.

11:40.734 --> 11:42.801
It's okay, I'm on hold.
I've been looking at

11:42.803 --> 11:44.302
All of our open cases
for the past year.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.738
None of them seem to have
anything to do with chess.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.206
What about outside vegas?

11:48.208 --> 11:49.941
You're thinking that
if our killer is connected

11:49.943 --> 11:51.076
To the king's crown tour,

11:51.078 --> 11:53.712
Maybe our cases
that we're looking for

11:53.714 --> 11:55.380
Are in cities where
the tour has stopped.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.749
Yeah. I'm on hold with
san francisco pd right now.

11:57.751 --> 11:59.918
Yeah. Oh, detective ettinger.

11:59.920 --> 12:03.188
Yeah, I'm looking
for unsolved murders

12:03.190 --> 12:04.923
The week of
February 17th.

12:04.925 --> 12:08.793
Right, bodies found near
numbered streets or avenues.

12:08.795 --> 12:12.797
It's gonna sound a little crazy,
but the crimes are gonna have

12:12.799 --> 12:15.734
Some sort of
association with chess.

12:15.736 --> 12:18.903
Yeah, like, the victim
could be a bishop or a priest

12:18.905 --> 12:21.339
Or maybe some
kind of queen.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.909
I know it sounds crazy.
Look, any help

12:24.911 --> 12:27.746
That-that you could give
would be greatly appreciated.

12:27.748 --> 12:28.747
Thank you.

12:28.749 --> 12:29.881
(laughs)

12:29.883 --> 12:31.316
I do not envy you.

12:31.318 --> 12:32.917
Well, misery
loves company.

12:32.919 --> 12:35.987
We... Have six more
cities to call.

12:41.227 --> 12:43.361
Sidle:
Russell, you were right.

12:43.363 --> 12:46.798
Our elvis impersonator was not
the killer's first victim.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.366
Morgan and I found
six other murders

12:48.368 --> 12:50.935
That look to be chess-related--
not in vegas,

12:50.937 --> 12:53.171
But in the last three cities
that the chess tour visited.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.973
Portland, san francisco
and reno.

12:54.975 --> 12:57.108
Sidle: <i>In portland,</i>
<i>a woman on horseback</i>

12:57.110 --> 12:58.176
<i>And a homeless man.</i>

12:58.178 --> 13:01.846
Sidle: <i>In san francisco,</i>
<i>a drag queen and a priest.</i>

13:01.848 --> 13:06.551
<i>And in reno, another</i>
<i>homeless person and a priest.</i>

13:06.553 --> 13:08.987
Russell:
<i>Another pawn and a bishop.</i>

13:08.989 --> 13:11.222
All the bodies were dumped
at intersections

13:11.224 --> 13:12.924
Of numbered
and lettered streets.

13:12.926 --> 13:14.492
So we have seven victims.

13:14.494 --> 13:15.860
Seven chess murders.

13:15.862 --> 13:17.228
Mm-hmm.

13:17.230 --> 13:20.131
But I don't believe that
the murders are capture-kills.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.167
The killer is not
eliminating pieces.

13:22.169 --> 13:25.036
I believe that these murders
are chess moves.

13:25.038 --> 13:27.172
Sanders: Like our dead elvis--
king to c1.

13:27.174 --> 13:30.008
He wasn't eliminating
the king...

13:30.010 --> 13:34.379
So we have a serial killer
who's playing a game,

13:34.381 --> 13:37.916
And every time he makes a move,
somebody dies.

13:37.918 --> 13:41.119
Yeah. Well, based on
what I can see,

13:41.121 --> 13:43.121
The game's
just beginning.

13:55.067 --> 13:57.068
I knew you'd be back.

13:57.070 --> 13:59.504
Same old max.

13:59.506 --> 14:00.972
How many games
have you played

14:00.974 --> 14:02.340
Just staring at
that board?

14:03.876 --> 14:06.344
Why don't you sit down...
Find out?

14:06.346 --> 14:07.579
I told you.

14:07.581 --> 14:09.113
I don't play anymore.

14:09.115 --> 14:11.249
You play every day.

14:11.251 --> 14:14.185
You just don't do it
on a chessboard.

14:16.622 --> 14:19.958
The only game I'm
playing right now

14:19.960 --> 14:21.926
Is "catch a killer."

14:21.928 --> 14:24.095
And I need your help.

14:24.097 --> 14:27.298
This is a list
of chess moves.

14:27.300 --> 14:31.269
I need to know what
move comes next.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.304
You already know it.

14:33.306 --> 14:37.275
In here.

14:37.277 --> 14:38.576
I really don't.

14:38.578 --> 14:41.112
I only have one
side of the board,

14:41.114 --> 14:43.147
And I don't know any of
the opponent's moves.

14:43.149 --> 14:45.650
Remember what I told you
all those years ago?

14:45.652 --> 14:49.053
Don't play the board,

14:49.055 --> 14:50.421
Play the man.

14:50.423 --> 14:55.393
Greg, the board is the
face of your opponent.

14:55.395 --> 14:59.197
You can know a man just
by watching him play.

14:59.199 --> 15:03.067
I knew you the minute you put
your money down to play me.

15:03.069 --> 15:05.169
You don't know me.

15:05.171 --> 15:08.473
You come here every
day after school.

15:08.475 --> 15:10.341
You're not at
football practice,

15:10.343 --> 15:12.944
You're not in the
parking lot getting high.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.913
You're different
from the other kids.

15:14.915 --> 15:18.016
You think differently,
feel differently.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.183
You want different.

15:19.185 --> 15:20.952
What do I want?

15:20.954 --> 15:23.388
You want to be the best!

15:23.390 --> 15:27.558
But to be the best,
you've got to go through me.

15:29.528 --> 15:30.929
School's in.

15:30.931 --> 15:32.297
Sanders:
<i>Come on, max.</i>

15:32.299 --> 15:34.065
We're not back
in the park.

15:34.067 --> 15:36.234
This isn't
a lesson here.

15:36.236 --> 15:38.303
There are people's
lives at stake.

15:45.144 --> 15:47.946
This game has already
been played.

15:47.948 --> 15:51.716
These are the opening moves
in the championship match

15:51.718 --> 15:54.719
Between karl schrute
and troy parker.

15:56.255 --> 15:59.624
Karl schrute-- that's the guy
doing the dog and pony show,

15:59.626 --> 16:01.259
Playing simuls in
this tournament here.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.461
Man's got to make a living.

16:05.331 --> 16:09.233
All right, what about, uh,
his opponent, parker?

16:09.235 --> 16:10.468
(chuckles)

16:10.470 --> 16:13.037
Troy parker was
the greatest american player

16:13.039 --> 16:14.339
Since bobby fischer.

16:14.341 --> 16:17.709
Till he lost
that championship in '98.

16:17.711 --> 16:20.378
After that,
he went off the rails.

16:20.380 --> 16:23.314
Just disappeared.

16:23.316 --> 16:27.318
Back in '98...

16:27.320 --> 16:29.253
What was parker's
next move?

16:29.255 --> 16:31.389
Bishop to e3.

16:33.692 --> 16:35.593
Mm, yes.

16:35.595 --> 16:38.463
It was parker's fatal move,
actually.

16:38.465 --> 16:40.398
A mental mistake.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.568
Uncharacteristic for
someone so gifted.

16:43.570 --> 16:46.537
And it was that move
that gave you the game?

16:46.539 --> 16:48.606
Yes, yes.

16:48.608 --> 16:51.275
He had me on the
ropes until then.

16:51.277 --> 16:54.212
Only a few moves
away from victory.

16:57.583 --> 16:59.684
And it wasn't just
the end of the game. No.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.719
It was the end of him.

17:01.721 --> 17:05.123
The man became a ghost.

17:05.125 --> 17:09.060
Do you think he might harbor
any resentment toward you

17:09.062 --> 17:12.630
About the game
or even try to...

17:12.632 --> 17:15.199
Engineer some kind
of a rematch?

17:15.201 --> 17:18.403
Troy parker was not
a violent man.

17:18.405 --> 17:19.337
Okay.

17:21.340 --> 17:24.275
So can you think of
anyone else out there

17:24.277 --> 17:27.578
Who might have
an unhealthy interest

17:27.580 --> 17:29.180
In your old match
with parker?

17:29.182 --> 17:30.815
I can think of
hundreds of people

17:30.817 --> 17:34.419
That cannot stop talking
about that match.

17:35.654 --> 17:38.156
And as far as
"unhealthy interest,"

17:38.158 --> 17:42.293
I get a letter a week
from some crackpot.

17:42.295 --> 17:43.694
Really?

17:43.696 --> 17:45.530
Have you, uh, received
any recently?

17:48.434 --> 17:50.301
You know, I did
receive an odd missive

17:50.303 --> 17:52.103
When I first arrived
at the hotel.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.337
I didn't think
twice about it.

17:53.339 --> 17:55.373
What kind of missive?

17:55.375 --> 17:59.343
It was a note wishing me well,
wrapped around a chess piece.

17:59.345 --> 18:03.114
Um, it was sort of,
mm... Handmade.

18:06.485 --> 18:08.286
It was a bishop.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.121
Do you still have it?
I believe so.

18:10.123 --> 18:13.524
Unless they've
emptied the trash.

18:14.393 --> 18:18.096
♪

18:44.189 --> 18:46.390
♪

18:56.668 --> 19:00.438
I processed the hand-carved
bishop sent to karl schrute.

19:00.440 --> 19:03.474
It wasn't hand-carved so much
as it was hand-sculpted.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.810
Made from papier-mâché.

19:05.812 --> 19:09.247
A curious stew of toilet
paper, laundry soap and water.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.282
Okay. That sounds improvised.

19:11.284 --> 19:13.618
By someone with a lot of time
on his hands.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.553
Say, a prison inmate?

19:15.555 --> 19:20.591
Is specifically formulated
to work with the hard water

19:20.593 --> 19:21.859
At ely state prison.

19:21.861 --> 19:23.528
Good work.

19:23.530 --> 19:24.829
All right, so we need

19:24.831 --> 19:27.465
To cross-reference the list
of people who attended

19:27.467 --> 19:29.934
The chess tour with
the population of ely, right?

19:29.936 --> 19:31.502
Already done.

19:31.504 --> 19:35.206
I have a face
and a name.

19:35.208 --> 19:36.507
You are on fire.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.743
"lee crosby."

19:45.484 --> 19:48.920
So you're just
gonna to sit there?

19:48.922 --> 19:50.755
Not gonna ask
why you're here?

19:50.757 --> 19:52.757
You'll tell me
when you want to.

19:52.759 --> 19:54.325
Or maybe
you already know.

19:54.327 --> 19:56.227
That's a photo

19:56.229 --> 19:57.929
From the dash-cam
of a number 7 bus.

19:57.931 --> 19:59.597
It shows you
two nights ago

19:59.599 --> 20:01.632
On the corner
of avenue c and 5th.

20:01.634 --> 20:05.336
Four blocks away from here.

20:06.405 --> 20:08.339
A bold opening.

20:08.341 --> 20:09.907
It's aggressive.

20:09.909 --> 20:14.812
With a big move, they don't have
much of a game to back it up.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.747
We're not playing
chess here, mr. Crosby.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.282
And the fact
of the matter is,

20:18.284 --> 20:19.817
We have plenty.

20:19.819 --> 20:22.720
I guess this is the part
where I call my lawyer.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.589
Five bills an hour--

20:24.591 --> 20:27.358
I say save the money,
indulge the cop.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.393
Stokes: We know you
spent five years

20:29.395 --> 20:30.761
At ely for possession,

20:30.763 --> 20:34.465
And that most of that time
was spent in a rehab program

20:34.467 --> 20:37.535
That taught you
how to play chess.

20:37.537 --> 20:39.704
Some inmates find god.
I found the royal game.

20:39.706 --> 20:41.339
Crawford: You know
what we keep finding?

20:41.341 --> 20:42.573
You.

20:42.575 --> 20:45.509
In portland,
san francisco, reno.

20:45.511 --> 20:47.612
All stops
on the chess tour.

20:47.614 --> 20:49.313
Cities where bodies
have been dropping.

20:49.315 --> 20:52.016
Like little chess moves
on a board.

20:52.018 --> 20:55.620
Admittedly, I am
a bit insane...

20:55.622 --> 20:57.955
About... Chess.

20:57.957 --> 21:01.459
Yes, I have been
following the tour,

21:01.461 --> 21:02.760
But, like, riding
buses at night.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.562
That's all
I've been doing.

21:06.565 --> 21:09.400
You know who
troy parker is, right?

21:09.402 --> 21:11.302
Heard of him.

21:11.304 --> 21:13.904
At ely, you ordered
over a dozen books on him.

21:13.906 --> 21:15.906
Including his book
on the game.

21:15.908 --> 21:17.475
Crawford: Sounds like
an obsession to me.

21:17.477 --> 21:20.411
I bet you know every move
this guy's ever made.

21:20.413 --> 21:23.314
I bet you even think
that you're better than him.

21:23.316 --> 21:25.683
Parker was the best,
at the top of his game,

21:25.685 --> 21:28.419
But he made a mistake,
a single bad move,

21:28.421 --> 21:29.620
And it was his undoing.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.455
Won't catch me making
that same error.

21:31.457 --> 21:33.057
Promise you that.

21:33.059 --> 21:34.892
You've been following
the chess tour.

21:34.894 --> 21:37.662
You've been dogging schrute,
trying to get him

21:37.664 --> 21:39.497
To play you one-on-one.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.465
There's a lot of people that
want to play schrute, okay?

21:41.467 --> 21:42.867
Stokes:
Everyone is not obsessed

21:42.869 --> 21:44.935
With his old adversary,
troy parker,

21:44.937 --> 21:46.370
The way that you are.

21:46.372 --> 21:50.341
That you're replaying
their match from '98.

21:50.343 --> 21:51.575
And you've taken it

21:51.577 --> 21:54.045
To a whole nother level,
mr. Crosby.

21:54.047 --> 21:55.713
You're killing people.

21:55.715 --> 22:00.551
In some sick,
twisted little fantasy.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.620
You're right.

22:04.990 --> 22:08.392
I would love to play schrute.

22:08.394 --> 22:11.495
God, I would love to replay
his famous match with parker.

22:11.497 --> 22:15.333
And you can forget about
"as good as parker,"

22:15.335 --> 22:16.467
Because I am better.

22:16.469 --> 22:17.935
I got something
that he never had.

22:17.937 --> 22:19.837
Crawford:
What's that?
Killer instinct.
Mm-hmm.

22:21.406 --> 22:23.407
And this is just
between you and me.

22:25.377 --> 22:26.877
I'm no killer.

22:31.049 --> 22:32.350
What do you think?

22:32.352 --> 22:33.117
Is he our guy?

22:33.119 --> 22:35.353
Well, he's got
the arrogance.

22:35.355 --> 22:37.688
Delusions of grandeur.

22:37.690 --> 22:40.091
Greg said he's got
quite a temper, too.

22:40.093 --> 22:42.393
All right, let's have
crawford sit on him

22:42.395 --> 22:44.395
While we get a warrant,
check out his place.

22:44.397 --> 22:45.529
(phone ringing)
yeah.

22:45.531 --> 22:46.864
We're definitely gonna
need something more

22:46.866 --> 22:49.066
To connect him to
one of the victims.

22:49.068 --> 22:51.535
What is it?

22:51.537 --> 22:53.404
(sighs)

22:53.406 --> 22:55.806
Another move
has been played.

22:59.144 --> 23:01.078
Sanders:
Hey, sara.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.914
I think we have
another chess killer victim.

23:03.916 --> 23:06.117
The next body dump
was supposed to be

23:06.119 --> 23:07.451
Near avenue e and 3rd.

23:07.453 --> 23:08.452
Yeah, I know.

23:08.454 --> 23:10.454
But, uh... You need to see this.

23:10.456 --> 23:13.524
Victim's name
is chris shatlock.

23:13.526 --> 23:15.493
I found his wallet
tossed on the floor.

23:15.495 --> 23:19.463
Work card says that he does
a dinner show at the four kings.

23:19.465 --> 23:21.098
Take a look.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.601
Security guard
discovered him.

23:23.603 --> 23:25.669
Run through from
back to front.

23:25.671 --> 23:28.105
Found his uniform in the back.

23:28.107 --> 23:29.874
Take a look.

23:33.645 --> 23:35.479
He's a knight of
the round table.

23:35.481 --> 23:37.014
Sanders:
A knight?

23:38.483 --> 23:40.951
But next victim
should've been a bishop.

23:40.953 --> 23:44.054
That's what schrute said;
it was parker's next move.

23:44.056 --> 23:46.190
Yes. But...

23:46.192 --> 23:49.160
He has an injection mark

23:49.162 --> 23:52.062
On his neck,
just like our dead elvis.

23:52.064 --> 23:54.665
And take a look at the wall.

23:55.634 --> 23:56.801
Knight to a4--

23:56.803 --> 23:58.502
That's a chess move.

23:58.504 --> 24:00.571
Killer's changed
his pattern.

24:01.740 --> 24:04.108
He's changed the game.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.147
♪

24:37.509 --> 24:39.810
♪

25:08.707 --> 25:11.075
♪

25:30.529 --> 25:32.963
Russell: Troy parker--
I thought he was a ghost.

25:32.965 --> 25:34.732
Are you sure about this print?
Yep.

25:34.734 --> 25:36.133
Which means
we are holding

25:36.135 --> 25:39.870
At least the, uh, knight
of the round table.

25:39.872 --> 25:42.540
T.O.D. Says he was killed
at the same time

25:42.542 --> 25:44.909
We had lee crosby
in the box.

25:44.911 --> 25:46.210
So what are
we thinking?

25:46.212 --> 25:49.580
That troy parker
is staging his comeback?

25:49.582 --> 25:51.248
Replaying the game
he lost to karl schrute?

25:51.250 --> 25:53.250
Only to him,
it's not a game.

25:53.252 --> 25:55.553
He's making his moves
by killing people.

25:55.555 --> 25:58.889
Okay, so the guy's
a grandmaster.

25:58.891 --> 26:01.258
Right? He thinks he's
smarter than his opponent.

26:01.260 --> 26:03.327
Right now,
his opponent is us,

26:03.329 --> 26:05.296
So we need
to make the next move.

26:05.298 --> 26:06.997
What do we know about him?
Anything?

26:06.999 --> 26:10.668
Well, since '98, he's been
pretty much of a recluse,

26:10.670 --> 26:13.304
And, uh, nobody has laid eyes
on him in the last five years.

26:13.306 --> 26:17.141
Nick did pull some trace
from the dead knight's car.

26:17.143 --> 26:19.310
Hopefully, parker left
something behind.

26:19.312 --> 26:20.911
We need to find this guy.

26:20.913 --> 26:22.913
(knocking)

26:22.915 --> 26:25.182
I think
troy parker just reached out.

26:25.184 --> 26:27.184
Csi russell,
jenny carroll.

26:27.186 --> 26:29.353
Ms. Carroll is in charge
of the chess tour.

26:29.355 --> 26:30.955
How do you do?

26:30.957 --> 26:32.723
How can I help you,
ms. Carroll?

26:32.725 --> 26:35.092
We received this package at
our reception area an hour ago.

26:35.094 --> 26:37.828
It was sent to our grandmaster-
in-residence, karl schrute.

26:37.830 --> 26:39.997
Has anyone else touched this
besides you?

26:39.999 --> 26:42.600
My assistant and I.
He's the one who opened it.

26:49.708 --> 26:51.175
It's a knight.

26:51.177 --> 26:53.344
Has mr. Schrute seen this yet?

26:53.346 --> 26:55.346
No, and truth is,
I can't find him.

26:55.348 --> 26:57.014
No one can.

26:57.016 --> 26:59.316
He's not in his room,
not answering his phone.

27:00.785 --> 27:02.620
You don't think something's
happened to him, do you?

27:02.622 --> 27:04.388
We're gonna need to keep this.

27:04.390 --> 27:08.158
Thank you so much
for-for bringing it to us.

27:08.160 --> 27:11.161
Sanders:
<i>He's changed the game, max.</i>

27:11.163 --> 27:12.630
Why?

27:12.632 --> 27:13.998
Why do you think?

27:14.000 --> 27:16.266
He wants to correct the error,

27:16.268 --> 27:18.369
The fatal mistake
he made the first time around,

27:18.371 --> 27:20.704
The one that cost him
the championship.

27:20.706 --> 27:22.272
Correct.

27:22.274 --> 27:26.343
Knight to a4 was the move troy
parker should have made in '98.

27:26.345 --> 27:29.346
So... The guy's
trying to win.

27:29.348 --> 27:31.315
No.

27:31.317 --> 27:33.384
He's going to win.

27:33.386 --> 27:35.786
But it's more than that.

27:35.788 --> 27:38.422
In '98, troy parker was
on the verge of doing something

27:38.424 --> 27:40.658
No one had ever done before
in competition.

27:40.660 --> 27:42.693
What are you talking about?

27:42.695 --> 27:44.361
The osterlitz endgame.

27:44.363 --> 27:48.799
It's like...
The holy grail of chess.

27:48.801 --> 27:50.834
Parker was three moves

27:50.836 --> 27:53.904
Away from making history
when he screwed up.

27:53.906 --> 27:56.373
Bishop to e3.

27:56.375 --> 28:00.010
The move that ruined his life.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.815
You think parker's killing
these people, don't you?

28:04.817 --> 28:06.450
I didn't say that.

28:06.452 --> 28:07.918
Let me tell you something.

28:07.920 --> 28:11.722
Troy parker was a genius.

28:11.724 --> 28:15.426
And... He was a fool.

28:15.428 --> 28:16.894
The man
you're looking for

28:16.896 --> 28:19.229
Is neither.

28:19.231 --> 28:22.700
And it's definitely not...
Parker.

28:22.702 --> 28:24.401
How can you
be so sure?

28:24.403 --> 28:28.138
I mean, you're the
one who said it.

28:28.140 --> 28:31.975
Chess can drive
a man to madness.

28:34.412 --> 28:35.746
Man:
You're troy parker?

28:35.748 --> 28:37.281
Is it really you?

28:37.283 --> 28:39.383
I often wonder that myself.
Do you mind?

28:39.385 --> 28:41.418
I can't believe this.
This is awesome.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.020
It really is you.

28:43.022 --> 28:44.855
Parker: Congratulations.
You want a prize?

28:44.857 --> 28:48.125
Man: Settle for an answer
to just one question.

28:48.127 --> 28:50.194
Bishop to e3, right?

28:50.196 --> 28:52.463
How could I have been so stupid?

28:52.465 --> 28:57.501
No, but you thought it...
Just like everyone thinks it.

28:57.503 --> 29:00.804
But aren't we all entitled to
make one mistake in our lives?

29:00.806 --> 29:02.306
Leave me alone.

29:02.308 --> 29:03.807
Man:
Bro, bro, come back.

29:04.876 --> 29:08.479
All I wanted to ask was,
"why did you quit?"

29:08.481 --> 29:10.414
Why did you quit?

29:10.416 --> 29:12.149
How long have you
been standing there?

29:12.151 --> 29:13.484
Not long.

29:13.486 --> 29:16.120
All these years, "captain
of the chess team."

29:16.122 --> 29:17.521
That's all you
ever told us.

29:17.523 --> 29:19.456
Didn't know you were
such a chess stud.

29:19.458 --> 29:22.760
Yeah, well, there are a lot of
things you don't know about me.

29:22.762 --> 29:24.862
(chuckles) you haven't
answered the question.

29:24.864 --> 29:26.797
I don't know why I quit.

29:26.799 --> 29:29.767
It's just, one day...

29:29.769 --> 29:31.902
I couldn't do it anymore.

29:33.505 --> 29:35.038
Like him.

29:35.040 --> 29:37.040
You know what the problem is

29:37.042 --> 29:40.978
With people like you,
with the world?

29:40.980 --> 29:44.948
You can't understand
what it is to be an artist.

29:44.950 --> 29:48.051
What it is to create beauty!

29:48.053 --> 29:50.788
You only understand <i>ugliness,</i>

29:50.790 --> 29:52.956
Because you can only
understand yourself!

29:52.958 --> 29:54.558
Man: Dude, I was just
trying to ask...

29:54.560 --> 29:56.426
Get that out of my face!

29:57.395 --> 29:59.396
Ooh.

29:59.398 --> 30:01.465
Man holds the
world in contempt.

30:01.467 --> 30:04.868
Just the kind of guy who might
see people as chess pieces.

30:08.239 --> 30:09.840
Hey, nick.

30:09.842 --> 30:12.509
There are no shortage
of people around

30:12.511 --> 30:14.444
Who have seen your little
friend, cimexlectularius.

30:14.446 --> 30:16.013
Oh, yeah? Like who?
Got a list here

30:16.015 --> 30:17.447
Of motels and weeklies,

30:17.449 --> 30:19.082
All with recent
infestations of bedbugs,

30:19.084 --> 30:21.018
Just like the one you found
when you processed the car.

30:21.020 --> 30:22.820
Take a look at the
one in boulder city.

30:22.822 --> 30:24.555
Manager there says
he's got a resident

30:24.557 --> 30:26.990
Who matches the photo we
sent over of troy parker.

30:26.992 --> 30:28.859
Really?
Yeah. A little
older and grayer,

30:28.861 --> 30:29.860
But it's definitely him.

30:29.862 --> 30:31.895
Good. Thanks, morgan.

30:33.932 --> 30:35.532
According to the manager,
parker's been here

30:35.534 --> 30:37.601
For about a year
under the name jason winston.

30:37.603 --> 30:39.536
He always pays his rent
in advance, cash.

30:39.538 --> 30:41.071
Keeps to himself.

30:41.073 --> 30:44.308
Hmm. Sounds to me like a
guy who didn't want to draw

30:44.310 --> 30:45.409
Any attention
to himself.

30:45.411 --> 30:46.577
Saving himself
for the big event?

30:46.579 --> 30:48.412
Yeah, well, game over.

30:49.881 --> 30:50.881
(knocking)

30:50.883 --> 30:52.983
Troy parker, lvpd.

30:52.985 --> 30:54.051
Open up!

31:00.625 --> 31:02.259
Lvpd!

31:04.028 --> 31:05.896
Parker!

31:24.048 --> 31:25.883
(water running)

31:41.499 --> 31:43.901
It's lee crosby.

31:43.903 --> 31:45.969
What?

31:47.505 --> 31:49.606
He's dead.

31:49.608 --> 31:50.974
(sighs)

31:50.976 --> 31:53.010
Damn it.

31:53.012 --> 31:54.311
Didn't have
enough to hold him.

31:54.313 --> 31:56.013
Had to let him go
this afternoon.

31:57.081 --> 31:58.315
Stokes:
Well, for somebody

31:58.317 --> 32:00.317
Who studied
parker's every move,

32:00.319 --> 32:03.287
I don't think he saw
that one coming.

32:10.361 --> 32:13.397
I found these vials
and-and syringes in the trash.

32:13.399 --> 32:15.365
Probably from the drug
that was used

32:15.367 --> 32:17.701
To paralyze the victims
before they were killed.

32:17.703 --> 32:19.970
I'll send it off to hodges.

32:23.374 --> 32:25.642
Talk about
a dangerous mind, huh?

32:25.644 --> 32:27.611
All these chessboards.

32:27.613 --> 32:30.480
And it looks like they're
playing the exact same game.

32:30.482 --> 32:31.715
They are.

32:31.717 --> 32:33.684
Except this one.

32:33.686 --> 32:35.218
It's further along.

32:35.220 --> 32:36.687
My friend max was right.

32:38.523 --> 32:40.691
It's the
osterlitz endgame.

32:40.693 --> 32:42.125
And parker's
playing it out.

32:42.127 --> 32:44.561
Crosby's murder--
it's another move.

32:44.563 --> 32:47.698
And see the pawn
there tipped over?

32:47.700 --> 32:49.166
Parker's saying
that he and crosby

32:49.168 --> 32:52.536
But this whole time,
crosby was just his pawn.

32:52.538 --> 32:56.606
And the move-- pawn to c6.

32:56.608 --> 32:59.242
<i>It's the part</i>
<i>of the osterlitz endgame</i>

32:59.244 --> 33:01.378
<i>Where the pawn</i>
<i>puts the king in check,</i>

33:01.380 --> 33:03.380
<i>Only to be quickly sacrificed.</i>

33:03.382 --> 33:05.115
What does he do next?

33:05.117 --> 33:07.117
Checkmate.

33:07.119 --> 33:09.186
He takes down the king.

33:11.622 --> 33:13.523
Karl schrute is missing.

33:13.525 --> 33:15.258
I think parker has him.

33:15.260 --> 33:17.160
And he's gonna kill him.

33:17.162 --> 33:19.262
Not if we find him first.

33:19.264 --> 33:21.331
♪

33:44.522 --> 33:46.523
Morgan, you're not
gonna believe this.

33:46.525 --> 33:48.358
Try me.
The drugs in the vials

33:48.360 --> 33:50.327
Recovered from parker's place?

33:50.329 --> 33:52.596
It's not the diphenhydramine
doc found in our victims.

33:52.598 --> 33:54.531
So what is it then?

33:54.533 --> 33:55.632
It's an experimental medication,

33:55.634 --> 33:57.367
Available only
in europe and mexico.

33:57.369 --> 33:58.602
Used to treat people

33:58.604 --> 34:01.538
In the late stages
of vascular dementia.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.673
You realize what this
means, don't you?

34:03.675 --> 34:05.242
If the drugs are parker's,
there's no way

34:05.244 --> 34:06.710
That he would be mentally
or physically capable

34:06.712 --> 34:08.445
Of committing
any of those crimes.

34:08.447 --> 34:11.148
(computer beeping)

34:12.383 --> 34:14.651
Parker's not our guy.

34:14.653 --> 34:17.621
Then who is?

34:18.589 --> 34:21.158
Where's csi sanders?

34:21.160 --> 34:22.659
That's not your
problem, mr. Lomax.

34:22.661 --> 34:27.697
Stokes: You knew this whole
time where parker was.

34:27.699 --> 34:29.566
And you know he can
barely lift a fork,

34:29.568 --> 34:30.767
Much less commit murder.

34:30.769 --> 34:32.436
Russell: You should
know we're going

34:32.438 --> 34:34.571
Through your
place right now.

34:34.573 --> 34:36.606
We're also going
through lee crosby's.

34:36.608 --> 34:39.076
Yeah, we know you two
hooked up at ely.

34:39.078 --> 34:41.111
During that outreach program.

34:41.113 --> 34:43.814
We know that you're the one who
taught him how to play chess.

34:43.816 --> 34:45.315
Russell: Is that where
you turned him on

34:45.317 --> 34:46.650
To this legendary match

34:46.652 --> 34:49.753
Between troy parker
and karl schrute?

34:49.755 --> 34:51.588
We got your prints.

34:51.590 --> 34:53.690
We got you for conspiracy.

34:53.692 --> 34:55.692
So the only thing keeping you
from the needle

34:55.694 --> 34:57.561
Is if you stop lying.

34:57.563 --> 34:59.429
And you tell us where parker

34:59.431 --> 35:01.465
And schrute are
right now.

35:01.467 --> 35:03.166
I never lied.

35:03.168 --> 35:05.235
The only thing
I'm guilty of

35:05.237 --> 35:08.105
Is caring for a great man.

35:08.107 --> 35:11.441
Now sadly diminished.

35:11.443 --> 35:14.778
My only crime is not
turning him over to you.

35:14.780 --> 35:17.547
To protect his memory.

35:17.549 --> 35:20.750
The world should remember him
for what he was.

35:20.752 --> 35:22.185
(chuckles softly)

35:22.187 --> 35:23.487
Not as he is.

35:23.489 --> 35:28.758
All we're concerned about,
mr. Lomax, is <i>where</i> he is.

35:28.760 --> 35:31.761
And karl schrute.

35:33.798 --> 35:35.866
Okay.

35:37.502 --> 35:39.202
That's too bad.

35:39.204 --> 35:41.304
But I'll tell
you something.

35:41.306 --> 35:44.407
For your sake, you better hope
they're still alive.

35:44.409 --> 35:46.476
Wherever they are.

35:53.819 --> 35:57.821
If I figured it out,
and I think I have,

35:57.823 --> 35:58.822
You can, too.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.524
But you've got to look

36:00.526 --> 36:02.325
In the right place.

36:02.327 --> 36:04.794
Just like I told you a long

36:04.796 --> 36:06.496
Time ago.

36:06.498 --> 36:09.332
To see the endgame,

36:09.334 --> 36:12.702
You have to see
the board through

36:12.704 --> 36:15.438
Your opponent's eyes.

36:16.674 --> 36:18.875
Lomax: Come on, kid,
moves are motivation.

36:18.877 --> 36:20.810
I'm telling you what I'm
doing, I'm telling you what

36:20.812 --> 36:22.746
I'm going to do. You got to
stop me, make it your game,

36:22.748 --> 36:23.947
Not mine.

36:23.949 --> 36:25.315
That's it. Good.

36:25.317 --> 36:26.783
Come on, come on.
There you go.

36:26.785 --> 36:28.852
There you go.
Take it, take it.

36:28.854 --> 36:31.655
Don't be afraid. Take it,
take it, take it, take it.

36:31.657 --> 36:33.356
Checkmate!

36:34.325 --> 36:36.193
The endgame.

36:46.437 --> 36:49.573
It's the queen.

36:49.575 --> 36:51.975
Please be careful with those.

36:51.977 --> 36:54.578
I'd like them to make
it at least until...

36:54.580 --> 36:57.714
Phoenix.

36:57.716 --> 37:00.383
So, the tour continues.

37:00.385 --> 37:02.719
Even without its
star attraction.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.788
Csi sanders.

37:04.790 --> 37:07.824
Still no word on
mr. Schrute's whereabouts?

37:07.826 --> 37:09.826
Still playing games?

37:09.828 --> 37:12.929
The list of vendors
you gave us--

37:12.931 --> 37:13.997
I checked it out.

37:13.999 --> 37:16.766
You closed out all
of the accounts.

37:16.768 --> 37:18.368
Except one.

37:18.370 --> 37:21.705
A storage facility downtown
in the alphabets.

37:21.707 --> 37:23.740
Don't worry
about it because

37:23.742 --> 37:25.742
We closed it for you.

37:25.744 --> 37:29.946
The same time that we rescued
karl schrute and troy parker.

37:29.948 --> 37:31.815
I get it.

37:31.817 --> 37:35.352
Men are weak, aren't they?

37:35.354 --> 37:37.721
Just like the king
on the chessboard.

37:37.723 --> 37:41.858
He hides while all the other
pieces fight to protect him.

37:41.860 --> 37:44.728
Lee crosby was weak, too.

37:44.730 --> 37:45.895
Easily seduced

37:45.897 --> 37:48.732
Into killing
for you.

37:48.734 --> 37:49.799
Am I right?

37:49.801 --> 37:51.001
What do you think?

37:51.003 --> 37:52.402
You neglected
to mention

37:52.404 --> 37:55.572
To us that you have
chess in your blood.

37:55.574 --> 37:56.773
Your father

37:56.775 --> 37:58.775
Was a grandmaster.

37:58.777 --> 38:00.377
You must've learned
a lot from him.

38:00.379 --> 38:01.978
I learned nothing from him.

38:01.980 --> 38:05.882
Except that, unlike my brothers,
I was worthless.

38:05.884 --> 38:07.784
Women are worthless.

38:08.853 --> 38:11.321
My father used to say,
"chess is a man's game

38:11.323 --> 38:14.791
Because it's about power,
intellect."

38:14.793 --> 38:17.927
All things, he said,
I did not possess.

38:17.929 --> 38:19.796
But your father was wrong.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.665
Damn right he was wrong.

38:21.667 --> 38:23.333
I was better than my brothers.

38:23.335 --> 38:24.801
Better than him.

38:24.803 --> 38:28.805
<i>And every time I killed,</i>
<i>I was killing him.</i>

38:28.807 --> 38:32.976
So why parker and schrute?

38:32.978 --> 38:35.979
They were just...

38:35.981 --> 38:37.914
Like him.

38:37.916 --> 38:39.883
Cut from the same cloth.

38:39.885 --> 38:42.352
So you were better
than them, too?

38:42.354 --> 38:44.454
You know, there are 32 pieces
on a chessboard--

38:44.456 --> 38:45.989
Bishops, knights,

38:45.991 --> 38:48.992
Pawns, kings.

38:48.994 --> 38:52.662
And yet which piece
is most powerful?

38:52.664 --> 38:54.998
The queen.

39:06.711 --> 39:08.778
♪

39:29.467 --> 39:31.534
♪

39:53.991 --> 39:56.059
(footsteps approaching)

39:57.027 --> 39:59.896
I was just
on my way out.

39:59.898 --> 40:01.731
Want to grab a bite?

40:01.733 --> 40:03.900
Uh, I should...
Probably finish this.

40:03.902 --> 40:05.869
Thanks though.
Okay.

40:07.805 --> 40:08.972
Actually,

40:08.974 --> 40:12.409
Um, you asked
why I quit playing chess.

40:12.411 --> 40:15.945
I used to think that it was

40:15.947 --> 40:20.016
Because I didn't think I had
what it took to be the best.

40:20.018 --> 40:22.152
Well, that couldn't
have been it.

40:22.154 --> 40:24.154
(both chuckle)

40:24.156 --> 40:26.156
And then I realized

40:26.158 --> 40:29.926
That chess...

40:29.928 --> 40:32.962
Requires a lot of sacrifice.

40:32.964 --> 40:34.697
Too much

40:34.699 --> 40:36.800
Sacrifice.

40:36.802 --> 40:38.768
And I just didn't think
it was worth it.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.937
It stopped being fun.

40:40.939 --> 40:43.072
It requires a totally
different way of thinking.

40:43.074 --> 40:46.476
You have to retrain
your mind, and...

40:46.478 --> 40:48.812
It starts to become

40:48.814 --> 40:49.879
An obsession.

40:52.550 --> 40:55.185
Kind of like this job.

40:55.187 --> 40:57.053
If you know
what I mean.

40:57.055 --> 40:58.988
I do.

41:01.859 --> 41:04.694
I was not even
my grade school champion,

41:04.696 --> 41:06.629
And this is kind of crazy,
but, you know,

41:06.631 --> 41:10.033
Russell's got that chessboard
in his office. Maybe...

41:10.035 --> 41:12.936
We should get something
to eat and play.

41:12.938 --> 41:15.638
For fun?

41:21.078 --> 41:23.079
Sure.

41:23.081 --> 41:28.151
(chuckles)

41:28.153 --> 41:30.220
I'll try.
(laughs)
