WHAT?

00:43.834 --> 00:46.034
ARE YOU GONNA SHARE
THAT CAKE WITH US?

00:46.036 --> 00:47.869
MMM, LET ME
THINK--NO.

00:47.871 --> 00:48.870
COME ON,
FAT ASS!

00:48.872 --> 00:50.238
YOU SHOULDN'T BE EATING
ALL THAT CAKE ANYWAY.

00:50.240 --> 00:52.607
IT'S CHOCOLATEY
AND DELIGHTFUL.

00:52.609 --> 00:53.842
GIVE US SOME,
CARTMAN!

00:53.844 --> 00:55.910
BE QUIET

00:55.912 --> 00:56.711
WHOA DUDE,

00:56.713 --> 00:58.079
THE ROAD IS REALLY
SNOWY OUT THERE.

00:58.081 --> 00:59.147
THE ROAD IS
ALWAYS SNOWY.

00:59.149 --> 01:00.782
I KNOW BUT IT'S
REALLY SNOWY TODAY.

01:00.784 --> 01:04.752
I CAN'T POSSIBLY
FINISH THIS WHOLE CAKE.

01:04.754 --> 01:06.354
YES, I CAN.

01:06.356 --> 01:08.456
SHUT UP, CARTMAN!

01:11.428 --> 01:13.461
OKAY,
THAT DOES IT!

01:13.463 --> 01:17.532
Y'ALL BE QUIET OR
THE CUTE LITTLE BUNNY DIES!

01:17.534 --> 01:19.701
( gasping )

01:25.141 --> 01:26.508
SHE ALWAYS TRIES
TO QUIET US DOWN

01:26.510 --> 01:27.909
BY THREATENING TO
KILL THAT BUNNY,

01:27.911 --> 01:29.277
BUT I WONDER
IF SHE EVER WOULD.

01:29.279 --> 01:31.246
SHE WOULD DUDE,
SHE WOULD.

01:31.248 --> 01:33.515
AHH!

01:33.517 --> 01:37.418
OH, FOR CHRIST SAKE,
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS!

01:41.791 --> 01:43.424
COME ON FAT BOY,
GIVE US SOME CAKE NOW.

01:43.426 --> 01:46.327
I CANNOT POSSIBLY
EAT ONE MORE BIT

01:46.329 --> 01:48.763
OF THIS CHOCOLATEY
GOODNESS.

01:48.765 --> 01:50.665
OH, WAIT, WAIT,
I'LL TRY.

01:50.667 --> 01:53.601
DAMMIT, YOU ARE
SUCH A FAT!@#$%

01:53.603 --> 01:56.037
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

01:57.007 --> 01:58.373
UH, OH.

01:58.375 --> 02:00.675
( screaming )

02:05.649 --> 02:06.948
I'M SCARED!

02:06.950 --> 02:09.350
BE QUIET, KIDS!

02:13.023 --> 02:15.957
AND RIGHT UP HERE YOU CAN
SEE A RED BELLIED CHICKADEE.

02:15.959 --> 02:18.760
THEY'RE INDIGENOUS
TO THIS AREA.

02:19.429 --> 02:21.296
( screaming )

02:21.298 --> 02:22.564
WHAT WAS THAT?

02:22.566 --> 02:24.899
WHAT WAS WHAT?

02:31.074 --> 02:32.006
ALL DONE.

02:32.008 --> 02:34.242
SIT DOWN
AND SHUT UP!

02:34.244 --> 02:35.710
( moaning )

02:35.712 --> 02:39.914
I SAID QUIET OR ELSE
I KILL THE BUNNY!

02:40.951 --> 02:42.050
WHERE ARE WE?

02:42.052 --> 02:43.051
I HAVE NO IDEA.

02:43.053 --> 02:44.485
I DON'T THINK WE'RE
IN A VERY SAFE SPOT.

02:44.487 --> 02:46.287
( Stan )
YEAH, WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO?

02:46.289 --> 02:47.789
JUST KEEP YOUR
TRAPS SHUT.

02:47.791 --> 02:50.358
I'LL CONSULT
THE MANUAL.

02:54.564 --> 02:55.697
MISS CRABTREE?

02:55.699 --> 02:56.631
SHUT UP KID!

02:56.633 --> 02:59.000
I HAVE TO WATCH
A TRAINING VIDEO!

02:59.002 --> 03:00.368
Hello and welcome
to tape seven

03:00.370 --> 03:02.136
of the bus driver's
video guidebook,

03:02.138 --> 03:04.405
"What to do if you've
become stranded".

03:04.407 --> 03:06.174
By now you've calmed
down the children

03:06.176 --> 03:07.342
and kept order
by using the

03:07.344 --> 03:09.477
"Keep quiet or I'll
kill the bunny" technique.

03:09.479 --> 03:10.878
Now it's time
to get help.

03:10.880 --> 03:12.313
The most important
thing to remember

03:12.315 --> 03:13.548
is that the children
will be safe

03:13.550 --> 03:15.650
as long as they
stay on the bus.

03:15.652 --> 03:17.518
So, do not, under
any circumstances,

03:17.520 --> 03:19.887
let any children
off the bus.

03:19.889 --> 03:21.089
The best way
to achieve this is

03:21.091 --> 03:23.458
to tell them something
like, "A big scary monster

03:23.460 --> 03:25.793
will eat you if
you step off the bus".

03:25.795 --> 03:28.730
KIDS, DO NOT GET
OFF THIS BUS!

03:28.732 --> 03:29.664
IF YOU DO,

03:29.666 --> 03:32.133
A BIG, SCARY MONSTER
WILL EAT YOU!

03:32.135 --> 03:32.867
That's right.

03:32.869 --> 03:34.335
With the children
properly subdued,

03:34.337 --> 03:35.370
you can leave
the bus

03:35.372 --> 03:36.804
and go out looking
for assistance.

03:36.806 --> 03:38.439
And remember your
bus driver's code,

03:38.441 --> 03:39.974
"Sit down and shut up"!

03:39.976 --> 03:41.009
I'M GOING
FOR HELP!

03:41.011 --> 03:42.577
I'LL BE BACK
AS SOON AS I CAN!

03:42.579 --> 03:44.278
REMEMBER, DON'T
GET OFF THIS BUS

03:44.280 --> 03:48.182
OR A BIG, SCARY
MONSTER WILL EAT YOU!

03:50.186 --> 03:52.820
HEY, WHY DOESN'T
THE SCARY MONSTER EAT HER?

03:52.822 --> 03:53.721
'CAUSE, DUMB ASS,

03:53.723 --> 03:55.556
SCARY MONSTERS DON'T EAT
BIG FAT SMELLY BITCHES.

03:55.558 --> 03:57.325
( Miss Crabtree )
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!

03:57.327 --> 04:01.729
I SAID<i> LARRY KING</i> WILL
GRANT ME THREE WISHES.

04:01.965 --> 04:02.997
HEY, THIS IS NOT GOOD.

04:02.999 --> 04:05.800
SHE COULD HAVE AT
LEAST LEFT THE HEAT ON.

04:08.204 --> 04:11.406
HAD TO HAPPEN
TO ME, DIDN'T IT?

04:12.175 --> 04:14.976
♪ LOOKING FOR LOVE IN
ALL THE WRONG PLACES ♪

04:14.978 --> 04:17.245

HELLO, LITTLE LADY,
GOING MY WAY?

04:23.219 --> 04:27.522

04:28.158 --> 04:30.525

04:38.068 --> 04:40.635

04:40.637 --> 04:42.603

04:48.078 --> 04:50.378

04:50.380 --> 04:53.114

MISS CRABTREE DOESN'T COME BACK

05:09.032 --> 05:11.099
AND WE'RE ALL
TRAPPED HERE FOREVER?

05:11.101 --> 05:11.966
( gasping )

05:11.968 --> 05:14.135
WE COULDN'T GET TRAPPED
HERE FOREVER, CARTMAN.

05:14.137 --> 05:16.003
WE'D DIE AFTER
A COUPLE OF DAYS.

05:16.005 --> 05:17.138
( gasping )

05:17.140 --> 05:17.939

05:17.941 --> 05:20.341
I DON'T WANT TO DIE

SITUATIONS THAN THIS

05:24.047 --> 05:25.546
AND COME OUT OF IT

05:25.548 --> 05:26.380

05:26.382 --> 05:27.749

AREN'T COMING FOR HIM?

05:32.789 --> 05:34.989

05:35.925 --> 05:37.725
HEY, HE'S

05:37.727 --> 05:40.261
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS FART SOME MORE CARTMAN,

05:40.263 --> 05:42.530
AND THE VISITORS
ARE SURE TO COME.

05:42.532 --> 05:43.231
REALLY?

05:43.233 --> 05:47.135
I DON'T THINK I HAVE

05:47.137 --> 05:48.102
SURE YOU DO!

05:48.104 --> 05:49.637

05:49.639 --> 05:50.538

07:35.912 --> 07:38.379
BROKEN DOWN BUS,

07:38.381 --> 07:41.215

DO YOU SEE HER,

DON'T YOU GET IT?

07:46.189 --> 07:47.788

08:04.140 --> 08:06.240

09:10.573 --> 09:12.039
OH, DEAR.

PERSON SINCE<i> MAURY POVICH.</i>

09:18.681 --> 09:19.513
WHAT'S HER ANGLE?

09:19.515 --> 09:21.148
I CAN'T EVEN EXPLAIN IT,
YOU'D HAVE TO SEE IT.

09:21.150 --> 09:23.751
ALRIGHT, THIS
BETTER BE GOOD.

09:24.554 --> 09:25.619
COME ON IN,

09:25.621 --> 09:28.189

09:28.191 --> 09:30.691
YOU BRAIN DEPRAVED
FECALPHILIAC!

09:30.693 --> 09:32.360
THIS IS MRS. CRABTREE.

09:32.362 --> 09:33.427
PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU.

09:33.429 --> 09:35.663

A LUMP OF DOG!@#$%

09:35.665 --> 09:37.431

09:38.868 --> 09:39.800
SHE'S FANTASTIC.

09:39.802 --> 09:41.769
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE
A MILLION DOLLARS, BABY?

09:41.771 --> 09:44.005
HOW'D YOU LIKE TO
SUCK MY ASS?!

09:44.007 --> 09:45.740
LET'S GET
STARTED RIGHT AWAY.

09:45.742 --> 09:46.841
YOU GONNA
BE ALRIGHT?

09:46.843 --> 09:47.708
DON'T TOUCH ME!

09:47.710 --> 09:49.910
I'M SORRY, DO YOU
NEED ANYTHING?

09:49.912 --> 09:51.345
NO, I JUST...

09:51.347 --> 09:51.979
WHAT?

09:51.981 --> 09:54.782
I CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL LIKE
I'VE FORGOTTEN SOMETHING.

09:58.755 --> 10:00.021
WHAT TIME IS IT?

10:00.023 --> 10:01.055
( mumbling )

10:01.057 --> 10:02.490
ON WEDNESDAY
OR THURSDAY?

10:02.492 --> 10:03.624
DUDE, I THINK
IT'S SATURDAY NOW.

10:03.626 --> 10:05.459
I'M MISSING THE NEW
"FANTASY ISLAND"!

10:05.461 --> 10:07.094
OH MAN, I DON'T THINK
IT'S VERY SAFE

10:07.096 --> 10:08.029
TO BE ON THIS BUS.

10:08.031 --> 10:10.398
WE CAN'T GO ANYWHERE
OR THE MONSTER
WILL GET US.

10:10.400 --> 10:11.999
WHAT DO YOU
THINK IT IS?

10:12.001 --> 10:12.933
I DON'T KNOW.

10:12.935 --> 10:14.201
IT'S A BIG,
SCARY MONSTER.

10:14.203 --> 10:16.170
MAYBE IT'S
SKUZZLE BUTT!

10:16.172 --> 10:17.104
WHAT?

10:17.106 --> 10:18.773
REMEMBER THE TIME
WE WERE UP CAMPING

10:18.775 --> 10:21.108
WITH YOUR
UNCLE JIMBO
AND NED?

10:21.110 --> 10:24.211
THE LAVA'S COMING
RIGHT FOR US.

10:24.213 --> 10:25.746
HELP!

10:32.522 --> 10:35.556
IT'S THE REAL
SKUZZLE BUTT.

10:35.558 --> 10:36.190
WHAT?

10:36.192 --> 10:37.258
SKUZZLE BUTT'S REAL!

10:37.260 --> 10:39.527
OH MY GOD,

10:39.529 --> 10:40.561
HI, KIDS.

10:40.563 --> 10:42.063

10:44.867 --> 10:47.301
QUICK NED,

10:47.303 --> 10:51.105
OH, NO,

10:51.107 --> 10:51.906
HEY LOOK!

10:51.908 --> 10:54.909
DUDE, HE'S
MAKING ICE CREAM.

10:55.678 --> 10:58.212
SKUZZLE BUTT
KICKS ASS.

10:58.214 --> 10:59.980
NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL
A STICKY SITUATION.

10:59.982 --> 11:01.916
OKAY, SO WE CAN AGREE
THAT THE MONSTER OUTSIDE

11:01.918 --> 11:04.718
CAN'T BE SKUZZLE BUTT
'CAUSE SKUZZLE BUTT'S NICE.

11:04.720 --> 11:07.788
HEY, MAYBE IT'S
OUR TEACHER, MR. GARRISON.

11:07.790 --> 11:08.823
DON'T BE
STUPID, CARTMAN.

11:08.825 --> 11:10.825
OUR TEACHER WOULDN'T BE
OUT LYING IN THE FOREST

11:10.827 --> 11:11.792
WAITING
TO KILL US.

11:11.794 --> 11:13.027
DON'T YOU REMEMBER
THE TIME HE WENT CRAZY

11:13.029 --> 11:15.763
AND TRIED TO KILL
<i>KATHIE LEE GIFFORD</i>?

11:15.765 --> 11:17.765
HERE SHE COMES!

11:23.873 --> 11:27.174
COME ON, YOU
LITTLE BITCH.

11:27.176 --> 11:29.376
IT IS WITH GREAT
PRIDE AND HONOR

11:29.378 --> 11:33.514
THAT I'D LIKE TO WELCOME
MRS. KATHIE LEE GIFFORD

11:33.516 --> 11:35.850
TO SOUTH PARK.

11:38.855 --> 11:40.654
THANK YOU.

11:41.757 --> 11:43.724
MR. GARRISON, STOP!

11:43.726 --> 11:44.492
LEAVE US.

11:44.494 --> 11:46.494
WE MUST FINISH
WHAT WE HAVE BEGUN.

11:46.496 --> 11:47.495
BUT MR. GARRISON...

11:47.497 --> 11:49.497
SHE'S NOT REALLY
KATHIE LEE GIFFORD.

11:49.499 --> 11:51.031
SHE'S SOME
KIND OF ALIEN.

11:51.033 --> 11:53.567
THANK YOU,
I LOVE YOU ALL.

11:53.569 --> 11:56.003
( gunshot )

12:01.711 --> 12:03.878
SEE, I TOLD YOU.

12:04.714 --> 12:07.314
WELL, THIS IS GONNA PUT
A DAMPER ON THE DAY.

12:07.316 --> 12:10.918
LET'S HAVE ICE CREAM,
EVERYONE!

12:11.854 --> 12:15.689
NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL
A STICKY SITUATION.

12:15.758 --> 12:17.992
BUT THE MONSTER OUTSIDE
COULDN'T BE MR. GARRISON

12:17.994 --> 12:19.960
'CAUSE MR. GARRISON
USED A GUN.

12:19.962 --> 12:21.028
OH, YEAH.

12:21.030 --> 12:23.230
LIVE FROM BURBANK...

12:23.566 --> 12:27.034

12:33.609 --> 12:34.775
JUST RELAX,
SWEETHEART.

12:34.777 --> 12:36.110
YOU'RE GONNA
KILL OUT THERE.

12:36.112 --> 12:36.877
KILL WHO?!

12:36.879 --> 12:38.245
THAT'S GREAT,
USE THAT.

12:38.247 --> 12:39.180
DO YOU NEED
ANYTHING?

12:39.182 --> 12:41.482
JUST GIVE ME ANOTHER
ONE OF THEM ROOFIES.

12:41.484 --> 12:42.316
SURE.

12:42.318 --> 12:44.518
OKAY, LET'S TRY
TO CALM DOWN, OKAY?

12:44.520 --> 12:47.354
THIS TYPE OF THING
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

12:47.356 --> 12:48.556
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

12:48.558 --> 12:51.725
HOW OFTEN DOES AN ENTIRE
THIRD GRADE CLASS GO MISSING?

12:51.727 --> 12:55.396
WELL, 99% OF THE TIME
WHEN A CHILD IS MISSING

12:55.398 --> 12:59.033
IT'S BECAUSE THEY'VE
RUN AWAY, OKAY?

12:59.035 --> 13:00.935
( gasping )

13:00.937 --> 13:01.769
RUN AWAY?

13:01.771 --> 13:04.405
OY, I KNEW I SHOULDN'T
HAVE MADE KYLE EAT

13:04.407 --> 13:05.339
THAT<i> GAFAGAHAGA.</i>

13:05.341 --> 13:06.774
HOW DO WE GET OUR RUNAWAY
CHILDREN BACK?

13:06.776 --> 13:09.810
WELL, WE JUST NEED TO MAKE
MAKE SOME POSTERS, OKAY?

13:09.812 --> 13:10.878
HAND OUT
BROCHURES, OKAY?

13:10.880 --> 13:13.447
THAT WAY THE PUBLIC CAN KNOW
WHAT THE CHILDREN LOOK LIKE

13:13.449 --> 13:15.783
AND CAN CALL IN
IF THEY'RE SPOTTED.

13:15.785 --> 13:16.450
OKAY?

13:16.452 --> 13:17.551
LET'S GET
STARTED RIGHT AWAY.

13:17.553 --> 13:19.353
THEY COULD BE HALF WAY
TO L.A. BY NOW.

13:19.355 --> 13:20.487
IT'S ONLY A
MATTER OF TIME

13:20.489 --> 13:22.156
BEFORE THEY'RE
SELLING THEIR BODIES

13:22.158 --> 13:23.591
AND BUYING SMACK!

13:23.593 --> 13:24.925
COME ON EVERYBODY!

13:24.927 --> 13:26.360
WE GOTTA FIND
THOSE KIDS!

13:26.362 --> 13:29.396
WE CAN DO IT.

13:34.670 --> 13:36.237
( creaking )

13:36.239 --> 13:37.438
WHAT WAS THAT?

13:37.440 --> 13:38.272
WHAT WAS WHAT?

13:38.274 --> 13:39.473
DUDE, I THINK
THE SCARY MONSTER

13:39.475 --> 13:40.641
IS RIGHT OUTSIDE
THE BUS.

13:40.643 --> 13:41.542
WHAT COULD
IT BE?

13:41.544 --> 13:43.210
IF ONLY WE KNEW
WHAT WE WERE UP AGAINST.

13:43.212 --> 13:44.979
( mumbling )

13:44.981 --> 13:46.614
OH YEAH,
I REMEMBER THAT.

13:46.616 --> 13:49.049
( mumbling )

13:49.051 --> 13:51.719
( screaming )

13:51.721 --> 13:54.855
COME BACK HERE
YOU SON-OF-A-PANSY!

13:54.857 --> 13:57.091
DON'T LET HIM
TOUCH YOU!

13:57.093 --> 13:59.593
YOU'LL DIE IF
HE TOUCHES YOU!

13:59.595 --> 14:02.463
COME OVER HERE
YOU SON-OF-A-WHORE!

14:04.600 --> 14:07.635
( mumbling loudly )

14:09.338 --> 14:12.072
OH MY GOD,
KENNY KILLED...

14:12.074 --> 14:12.940
...DEATH.

14:12.942 --> 14:14.575
YOU BASTARD?

14:16.445 --> 14:18.412
...STICKY SITUATION.

14:18.414 --> 14:20.514
YEAH, BUT THE MONSTER
OUTSIDE COULDN'T BE DEATH

14:20.516 --> 14:22.449
BECAUSE DEATH
ONLY TOUCHES YOU,

14:22.451 --> 14:23.350
IT DOESN'T
EAT YOU.

14:23.352 --> 14:25.719
WHO REALLY CARES IF
THAT MONSTER'S OUTSIDE?

14:25.721 --> 14:27.221
AS LONG AS WE
STAY ON THE BUS,

14:27.223 --> 14:30.457
IT CAN'T HURT US,
RIGHT?

14:30.459 --> 14:32.426
( screaming )

14:32.428 --> 14:34.928
OH MY GOD,
HE'S KILLING KENNY!

14:34.930 --> 14:37.031
YOU BASTARD!

14:37.199 --> 14:38.966
OH BOY, WE'RE
IN BIG TROUBLE.

14:38.968 --> 14:42.770
HEY YOU GUYS,
CAN WE ORDER
A PIZZA?

14:46.309 --> 14:49.610
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU ALL STARING AT!

14:49.612 --> 14:52.579
STOP LAUGHING,
YOU WHORES!

14:52.581 --> 14:56.250
I SAID SHUT UP!

15:00.823 --> 15:02.990
LET'S HEAR IT
FOR MISS CRABTREE!

15:02.992 --> 15:04.191
WHAT AN UP-AND-COMER!

15:04.193 --> 15:05.225
THAT WAS
GREAT, MA'AM.

15:05.227 --> 15:06.927
WAS IT?
DOES IT EVEN MATTER?

15:06.929 --> 15:07.895
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

15:07.897 --> 15:09.096
SUCCESS IS
HOLLOW, MITCH.

15:09.098 --> 15:10.097
HOLLOW LIKE
A DEAD TREE.

15:10.099 --> 15:12.099
I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR ME TO GIVE IT UP.

15:12.101 --> 15:13.100
ARE YOU SURE?

15:13.102 --> 15:13.834
I'M SURE.

15:13.836 --> 15:16.070
LET'S GET
A CUP OF COFFEE.

15:17.873 --> 15:20.174
I WONDER WHEN THE MONSTER'S
GONNA COME BACK

15:20.176 --> 15:21.041
TO FEED AGAIN?

15:21.043 --> 15:22.810
WE JUST GOTTA
STICK TOGETHER.

15:22.812 --> 15:25.312
YEAH, THERE'S GOT TO BE
A WAY OUT OF THIS.

15:25.314 --> 15:26.847
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

15:26.849 --> 15:27.614
WHAT?

15:27.616 --> 15:29.450
REMEMBER THAT TIME<i> FONZIE</i>
JUMPED OVER THE BUSSES

15:29.452 --> 15:31.185
WITH HIS MOTORCYCLE?

15:36.459 --> 15:38.425
GO FONZIE!

15:38.427 --> 15:39.426
HEY!

15:39.428 --> 15:40.894
YOU CAN DO IT,
FONZIE.

15:40.896 --> 15:42.796
WE BELIEVE
IN YOU, FONZ.

15:42.798 --> 15:44.832
HEY!

15:59.682 --> 16:01.682
HEY!

16:02.184 --> 16:04.385
OH MY GOD,
THEY KILLED KENNY!

16:04.387 --> 16:05.352
YOU BASTARD!

16:05.354 --> 16:08.222
NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL
A STICKY SITUATION.

16:08.224 --> 16:10.057
YOU DUMB ASS
CARTMAN,

16:10.059 --> 16:11.358
THAT'S NOT THE WAY
IT HAPPENED.

16:11.360 --> 16:13.961
YEAH, KENNY JUST DIED
EIGHT HOURS AGO
FROM THAT MONSTER.

16:13.963 --> 16:15.462
HOW COULD HE HAVE
DIED BACK THEN TOO?

16:15.464 --> 16:18.065
OH YEAH,I GUESS
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

16:18.067 --> 16:19.700
OH, NO.

16:19.702 --> 16:22.202
( screaming )

16:22.204 --> 16:28.675
WHAT ARE
WE GONNA DO!

16:28.677 --> 16:30.544
NO, WE NEED MORE
WEIGHT IN THE BACK!

16:30.546 --> 16:33.414
NO, THAT'S
TOO MUCH!

16:35.217 --> 16:36.383
THERE, I THINK
WE GOT IT.

16:36.385 --> 16:38.118
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER
WE CAN KEEP THIS UP, DUDE.

16:38.120 --> 16:39.953
DON'T WORRY,
EVERYTHING'S
GONNA WORK OUT.

16:39.955 --> 16:41.488
IT DOES?
IT ALWAYS DOES.

16:41.490 --> 16:43.257
SURE, REMEMBER THAT TIME THAT
THAT KID IN THE RED SHIRT

16:43.259 --> 16:44.691
DECIDED TO GO OFF
ON HIS OWN?

16:44.693 --> 16:47.694
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA
SIT HERE AND WAIT TO DIE

16:47.696 --> 16:49.229
WITH THE REST
OF YOU!

16:49.231 --> 16:51.532
IF I MAKE IT BACK,
I'LL SEND HELP.

16:51.534 --> 16:53.333
DON'T DO IT, KID!

16:58.107 --> 16:59.406
MAYBE MISS CRABTREE
DID MAKE UP

16:59.408 --> 17:02.342
THAT STUFF ABOUT
THE BIG, BLACK MONSTER.

17:06.148 --> 17:08.515
HOLY CRAP, DUDE!

17:09.151 --> 17:11.151
HEY, LOOK IT'S
GOT ICE CREAM!

17:11.153 --> 17:13.287
HEY.

17:16.759 --> 17:20.527
NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL
A STICKY SITUATION.

17:24.066 --> 17:25.265
WOW, THIS
IS GORGEOUS.

17:25.267 --> 17:28.368
I DON'T THINK I'D EVER SEEN
ANYTHING SO BEAUTIFUL.

17:28.370 --> 17:29.536
FROM A DISTANCE,

17:29.538 --> 17:31.772
THIS PLACE LOOKS LIKE
A COLD DAMP MARSH,

17:31.774 --> 17:33.507
BUT WHEN ONCE YOU
GET INSIDE IT,

17:33.509 --> 17:35.943
YOU REALIZE THAT
IT HAS AN INNER BEAUTY

17:35.945 --> 17:37.344
FAR SURPASSING OTHERS.

17:37.346 --> 17:41.014
THANK YOU FOR
SHARING YOUR TIME
WITH ME, MISS CRABTREE.

17:41.016 --> 17:42.416
PLEASE CALL ME
MUFFIN.

17:42.418 --> 17:44.351
I'M HAVING
A NICE TIME, MUFFIN.

17:44.353 --> 17:45.319
ME TOO, MARCUS.

17:45.321 --> 17:49.056
I'D FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT
MY CARES IN THE WORLD.

17:50.960 --> 17:54.528
DAMN MAN, NOW I'M MISSING
THE NEW "BARNABY JONES"!

17:54.530 --> 17:56.196
HEY, MISS CRABTREE
HAD THAT LITTLE TV

17:56.198 --> 17:57.364
FOR THE TRAINING VIDEO,

17:57.366 --> 17:59.032
MAYBE WE CAN
WATCH TV ON IT.

17:59.034 --> 18:01.068
HEY, YEAH.

18:01.971 --> 18:03.570
...and all over America,

18:03.572 --> 18:05.439
kids are turning
to the streets

18:05.441 --> 18:06.707
and running away.

18:06.709 --> 18:08.208
Tonight a very
special message

18:08.210 --> 18:10.444
from the parents
of some runaway children,

18:10.446 --> 18:12.179
in hopes
that their young

18:12.181 --> 18:13.480
will hear their cry.

18:13.482 --> 18:17.351
HELLO STANLEY,
IT'S ME PAPA.

18:18.087 --> 18:19.720
GOSH, YOUR MOTHER
AND I MISS YOU.

18:19.722 --> 18:21.688
AND I HOPE THAT
