00:19.019 --> 00:20.438
ELIJAH:
Damn.

00:20.479 --> 00:23.441
BELL:
Hmm. "Damn" is right.

00:23.482 --> 00:26.360
What's this bed made out of?

00:26.402 --> 00:27.987
(inhales sharply)

00:28.028 --> 00:29.780
(exhales)

00:29.822 --> 00:31.991
-Goose feathers.
-Goose feathers.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.076
(Bell chuckles softly)

00:34.118 --> 00:36.078
Well, a whole lot of geese
had to die

00:36.120 --> 00:38.581
so Her Majesty
could get some shut-eye.

00:38.622 --> 00:41.959
BELL:
They did not die in vain.

00:42.001 --> 00:43.961
I don't think we should sleep
in here tonight.

00:44.003 --> 00:46.922
Last night was one thing, but...

00:46.964 --> 00:49.508
the more I look around
this room, I...

00:49.550 --> 00:52.094
No more of that.

00:54.764 --> 00:56.348
I just want us to...

00:56.390 --> 00:58.976
live in this moment.

00:59.018 --> 01:01.228
There's too many ghosts
in this room.

01:01.270 --> 01:04.315
What we need to do
is rip all this shit out.

01:04.356 --> 01:05.733
This bed, that...

01:05.775 --> 01:07.985
weird little tree over there.

01:08.027 --> 01:10.196
Look at all this space.

01:10.237 --> 01:12.782
We could bunk,
like, ten comrades in here.

01:18.704 --> 01:21.582
Then that's what we'll do.

01:21.624 --> 01:23.083
(air raid siren blaring)

01:23.125 --> 01:24.794
(men shouting in distance)

01:24.835 --> 01:27.254
-Oh, shit.
-MAN: Move, move!

01:27.296 --> 01:29.298
(all clamoring)

01:29.340 --> 01:32.176
Everybody get down
to the shelter, now!

01:32.218 --> 01:34.553
We got a radio call at 6:45 from

01:34.595 --> 01:36.138
-our allies in Aztlan.
-Their spotters caught

01:36.180 --> 01:39.767
a flight of HE-200 heavy bombers
moving in over Fremont.

01:39.809 --> 01:42.436
-Shit.
-(planes approaching)

01:42.478 --> 01:44.396
Brace yourselves.
Everybody, take cover!

01:44.438 --> 01:47.858
Get down! Everybody,
take cover, come on! Get down!

01:47.900 --> 01:49.693
(engines roaring)

01:51.070 --> 01:54.365
Lord, if it'll be your will...

01:54.406 --> 01:56.617
(engines continue roaring)

02:02.164 --> 02:04.083
(planes passing)

02:04.124 --> 02:06.126
(people murmuring)

02:13.008 --> 02:15.010
What the hell is this?

02:18.055 --> 02:19.890
-(planes passing)
-Leaflets.

02:28.399 --> 02:29.984
"People of San Francisco,

02:30.025 --> 02:32.778
resist your Negro overlords."

02:32.820 --> 02:35.281
I've been called all kinds
of shit in my time, but...

02:35.322 --> 02:38.659
-"overlord"?
-Don't know, Leon.

02:38.701 --> 02:40.786
The cat with the bayonet
kind of looks like you.

02:40.828 --> 02:46.166
"The Reich is coming to liberate
the city of San Francisco."

02:46.208 --> 02:48.294
Next time it won't be
paper they're dropping.

Obergruppenfuhrer.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.249
How was your flight?

04:50.290 --> 04:52.209
Very smooth, thank you.

04:52.251 --> 04:55.004
I've begun to think of New York
as my second home.

04:55.045 --> 04:57.297
-(chuckles)
-Oberstgruppenfuhrer Eichmann,

04:57.339 --> 04:59.925
I'd like to introduce to you...

04:59.967 --> 05:01.927
Reichsmarschall John Smith.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.721
We've met.

05:03.762 --> 05:05.639
General.

05:05.681 --> 05:07.683
Welcome to Berlin...

05:07.725 --> 05:09.393
Reichsmarschall.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.149
Gentlemen.

05:15.190 --> 05:16.859
The Fuhrer is ready for you.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.444
If you'll come this way.

05:23.949 --> 05:25.909
I'm afraid this will take
a few hours.

05:25.951 --> 05:29.538
I'm sure you'll want
to get some rest.

05:34.209 --> 05:37.171
Show the Reichsmarschall
to his quarters.

05:39.381 --> 05:45.471
I prefer the 5th Panzer
by rail across Wyoming...

05:45.512 --> 05:49.767
and the 83rd by rail
across New Mexico.

05:53.479 --> 05:55.355
You, uh...

05:55.397 --> 05:58.776
might want to work
on your presentation.

05:58.817 --> 06:00.819
The knives will be out...

06:00.861 --> 06:03.489
and sharpened.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.491
(quiet chatter, coughing)

06:07.868 --> 06:09.870
(music playing faintly over TV)

06:16.543 --> 06:19.880
(newsman speaking Japanese
over TV)

06:24.927 --> 06:26.929
(groans softly)

06:31.266 --> 06:33.227
(grunts)

06:33.268 --> 06:35.646
(newsman continues in Japanese
over TV)

06:40.859 --> 06:46.198
Soon, the last ship leaves
for Japan...

06:46.240 --> 06:51.995
and with it the life
we have made here.

06:52.037 --> 06:54.123
This concludes
the final broadcast

06:54.164 --> 06:56.250
of Empire TV San Francisco.

06:56.291 --> 06:57.960
Farewell.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.380
Long live the Emperor.

07:04.007 --> 07:11.765
May the Emperor's reign

07:11.807 --> 07:15.936
Continue for a thousand

07:15.978 --> 07:20.482
Eight thousand generations

07:20.524 --> 07:28.949
Until the pebbles

07:28.991 --> 07:37.124
Grow into boulders

07:37.166 --> 07:50.888
Lush with moss

07:51.972 --> 07:54.516

08:32.512 --> 08:34.473
MAN:
It's all going haywire.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.475
What's happening?
What's going on?

08:36.516 --> 08:38.560
Whoa! Fuck!

08:42.356 --> 08:43.357
Shit!

08:44.608 --> 08:47.694

08:58.121 --> 09:00.123
You okay?

09:02.125 --> 09:04.127
Yeah.

09:07.130 --> 09:10.133
Yeah, fine.

09:17.266 --> 09:19.268
Did that lithograph fit?

09:20.560 --> 09:22.521
We've packed too much.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.398
(sighs)

09:24.439 --> 09:26.775
That's our whole future
in that suitcase.

09:26.817 --> 09:29.611
It's taken me years
to curate this collection.

a Pon near here?

09:41.832 --> 09:43.250

The place looks empty.

Just stay hidden
no matter what you hear.

Let's check it out.

Yeah, that's clear.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.889
MAN 1:
Okay.

10:01.143 --> 10:03.395
Excuse me.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.819
MAN:
A Pon was spotted on this block

10:10.861 --> 10:12.070
couple hours ago.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.780
Pon. Yeah.

10:13.822 --> 10:15.907
I don't know anything
about that.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.868
You don't mind if we do
a little look around, then?

10:17.909 --> 10:19.911
Sure. Go ahead.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.080
Suit yourself.
There's a gold nugget

10:22.122 --> 10:25.417
in that case behind you.

10:25.459 --> 10:28.128
The glass case.

10:28.170 --> 10:29.296
Back there.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.801
Was, uh, discovered in the...

10:34.843 --> 10:37.804
Blackfoot River in 1860.

10:37.846 --> 10:39.222
I don't see any gold nugget.

10:39.264 --> 10:41.350
This might be
of interest to you.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.185
Signed by Lipman Pike,

10:43.226 --> 10:45.729

10:45.771 --> 10:47.105
Get out of my shop.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.402
Get out!

10:52.444 --> 10:54.988
(chuckles):
Okay, all right.

10:55.030 --> 10:57.282
We get it.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.992
We're leaving.

10:59.034 --> 11:01.119
It's okay.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.662
Good.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.208
Good. Get out.

11:06.249 --> 11:07.793
Stay out!

11:09.753 --> 11:12.255
(sighs)

11:17.260 --> 11:19.679
You all right?

11:19.721 --> 11:21.723
We have to get out of here.

15:31.931 --> 15:36.895
I-I'm calling to confirm my
appointment for 11:00 tomorrow.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.521
Uh, thank you.

15:38.563 --> 15:40.523
Thank you. We'll see you then.

Thank you.

15:58.708 --> 16:00.794
I didn't hear you come in.

16:00.835 --> 16:02.837
Are you feeling all right?

Nothing to worry about.

signed by

16:39.916 --> 16:42.252
Her Majesty the Crown Princess.

16:42.293 --> 16:44.254
Uh, your assistance
in this matter, I'm sure,

16:44.295 --> 16:46.840
would be greatly appreciated
by the royal family.

16:46.881 --> 16:49.217
Forgery. Step aside.

16:49.259 --> 16:50.927
No, no, no.
This letter is genuine.

16:50.969 --> 16:52.971
This is the... that's
the crown princess's signature.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.764

-Sergeant.

16:57.892 --> 17:00.562
We could arrange to pay
for our passage with your help.

17:00.603 --> 17:02.981
The ship is full.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.065
Sir, we have money.

17:11.740 --> 17:13.742
What's in the suitcase?

Uh...

It's, uh...

SERGEANT:
This is junk.

17:29.007 --> 17:31.551
Sir, no, no, no. Please.

17:31.593 --> 17:34.095
If you'll permit me, this...

17:34.137 --> 17:37.182
this is a-a verge fusee
quarter repeater.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.851
Its hands have marked
every moment

17:39.893 --> 17:43.938
in the lives of the Tokugawa
shoguns and of Louis Quatorze.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.940
They'll mark the moments
of your own life,

17:45.982 --> 17:50.612
and-and it'll become an heirloom
for your descendants.

17:57.660 --> 17:59.037
Mm.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.208
Get your things.
Get your things.

18:04.459 --> 18:06.920
Go ahead. Go ahead.

18:08.797 --> 18:11.174
Not you. Just her.

18:11.216 --> 18:13.009
No. Sir...

18:13.051 --> 18:15.094
The ship is leaving.

18:15.136 --> 18:18.139

-No, no.

18:28.733 --> 18:29.901
Give it to your mistress.

18:29.943 --> 18:31.402
-Yukiko, don't.
-It's okay.

18:32.153 --> 18:34.614
Sell it, buy a car. Take it.

18:34.656 --> 18:36.825
Just let my husband on board!

18:37.826 --> 18:39.202
-Hey. Hey, hey.
-YUKIKO: Sir, please.

18:39.244 --> 18:40.745
Just her.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.164
Sir, please.

18:43.206 --> 18:45.416
(shuddering)

18:45.458 --> 18:46.751
Listen. Listen.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.045
There's no other way.
You go on.

18:49.087 --> 18:50.922
You're my husband.
We belong together.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.340
I know.
But it's impossible.

18:52.382 --> 18:53.341
All right?

18:53.383 --> 18:55.301
I need for you to be safe.

18:55.343 --> 18:57.220
You go ahead.

18:57.262 --> 19:00.139
I love you so much, Robert.

19:01.182 --> 19:04.018
I love you with all my heart.

19:08.231 --> 19:09.983
Go. You'll be fine.

19:10.024 --> 19:11.109
Go ahead. (sniffles)

19:11.150 --> 19:12.610
-SERGEANT: Next!
-Go on.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.946
-Next!
-Go ahead.

19:14.988 --> 19:17.156
-It's all right. Go on.
-Move it.

19:17.198 --> 19:18.950
(ship's horn blowing)

19:18.992 --> 19:21.536
Next!

19:21.578 --> 19:24.539
(indistinct chatter)

19:28.376 --> 19:30.795
(frantic chatter)

19:34.507 --> 19:36.259
(clucking)

19:36.301 --> 19:38.845
(meowing)

19:42.849 --> 19:45.226
(gulls calling in distance)

19:58.740 --> 20:00.241
OSCAR:
There's a section of

20:00.283 --> 20:01.910
the old Southern Pacific
rail line that runs

20:01.951 --> 20:03.411
right to the migrant camp
in Salinas.

20:03.453 --> 20:05.246
Children, the infirm
and the elderly

20:05.288 --> 20:07.582
will all be evacuated
in four days' time.

20:07.624 --> 20:09.334
These, uh, power transformers

20:09.375 --> 20:11.127
-are badly damaged.
-Yeah, well, we weren't

20:11.169 --> 20:13.171
thinking we might need 'em
when we blew 'em up.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.797
-The city gonna stay dark, okay?
-(sighs)

20:14.839 --> 20:16.966
We need to focus on
the resources we actually got.

20:17.008 --> 20:20.136
All we wanted was a homeland.
40 acres and a mule.

20:20.178 --> 20:23.097
-We got half of North America.
-(indistinct arguing)

20:23.139 --> 20:24.766
We've just got to hold down
San Francisco.

20:24.807 --> 20:26.184
-Look here.
-DOYLE: We are not
going anywhere

20:26.225 --> 20:27.352
until someone talks to us.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.103
LEON:
Get out of here, man.

20:29.145 --> 20:30.855
I can't just have you walk
in here.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.857
DOYLE:
Who are you to tell us
where we can go?

20:32.899 --> 20:34.233
-LEON: I don't think
you understand...
-Leon.

20:39.572 --> 20:42.283
Follow me.

20:42.325 --> 20:44.452
We frisked 'em on the way in.

20:44.494 --> 20:46.079
They ain't got nothing here.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.082
All right,
who's in charge here?

20:49.123 --> 20:50.416
All of us.

20:50.458 --> 20:52.627
But you can talk to me.

20:52.669 --> 20:54.462
We're here for Kido.

20:54.504 --> 20:57.048
-We know you have him.
-He's in our custody.

20:57.090 --> 20:58.257
Well, you should hand him over.

20:58.299 --> 20:59.592
We're going to put Kido
on trial.

20:59.634 --> 21:01.469
-(scoffs) On trial?
-That's right.

21:01.511 --> 21:03.596
Kido never gave anybody
a fair trial.

21:03.638 --> 21:05.890
Things are gonna be a little
different from here on out.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.558
If he's convicted,
he is going to spend

21:07.600 --> 21:10.269
the rest of his life
on Alcatraz.

21:10.311 --> 21:13.272
Let me tell you something.

21:13.314 --> 21:15.650
If you lynch

21:15.692 --> 21:18.319
or loot in San Francisco,

21:18.361 --> 21:20.947
we gonna put you right in there
with him.

21:20.989 --> 21:24.575
18 years, we live
with the yellow man's boot

21:24.617 --> 21:26.744
on our neck.
We are not about to...

21:26.786 --> 21:31.624
Nobody's boot's gonna be
on anybody's neck any longer.

21:31.666 --> 21:34.460
Who you kidding?

21:34.502 --> 21:37.296
Nazis roll in here,
you Negroes all

21:37.338 --> 21:38.965
going in a concentration camp.

21:39.007 --> 21:40.800
And Kido will be sprung,
working for them.

21:40.842 --> 21:43.219
We've been in their camps.
We're not going back.

21:43.261 --> 21:45.972
We brought down one empire.
We will bring down another.

21:52.437 --> 21:53.980
Let's go.

21:57.817 --> 22:00.278
(television static)

22:00.319 --> 22:02.739
(triumphant music playing)

22:06.701 --> 22:09.120
(announcer speaking Japanese)

22:25.553 --> 22:28.598
You were right.

22:28.639 --> 22:30.433
(speaks Japanese)

22:30.475 --> 22:34.604
Okudaira was a good trade
for Yanaihara.

22:34.645 --> 22:35.855
(crowd cheering over TV)

22:35.897 --> 22:37.482
Okudaira?

22:37.523 --> 22:40.193
Aren't you going
to eat your manju?

22:43.362 --> 22:45.364
You can have it.

22:52.330 --> 22:56.876
Coach Egawa says he may move me
to shortstop next season.

22:56.918 --> 22:58.461
Shortstop.

22:58.503 --> 23:00.671
That is
a very important position.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.090
Very demanding.

23:02.131 --> 23:04.092
You must have...

23:04.133 --> 23:06.594
impressed Coach Egawa.

23:06.636 --> 23:09.347
(announcer speaking excitedly
over TV)

23:09.388 --> 23:11.891
Ground ball to second.

23:11.933 --> 23:14.811
Out at first.

23:14.852 --> 23:17.021
Someday, I want to grow up

23:17.063 --> 23:20.900
and play shortstop
for the Yomiuri Giants.

23:22.944 --> 23:26.572
Do not let your imagination
run away with you.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.201
Of course.

23:30.243 --> 23:34.080
You will serve in the army.

23:34.122 --> 23:37.542
I'm sorry, Father.

23:43.422 --> 23:46.008
(sighs)

23:46.050 --> 23:48.886
If you work hard enough,

23:48.928 --> 23:52.098
you will become
a fine ballplayer.

23:54.809 --> 23:58.729
We will go to the park

23:58.771 --> 24:02.775
and practice fielding
ground balls.

24:04.861 --> 24:07.613
How does that sound?

24:09.323 --> 24:11.701
(static droning)

24:28.593 --> 24:30.344
-(phones ringing)
-RECEPTIONIST: Davenport
Women's Clinic.

24:30.386 --> 24:32.138
How can I help you?

24:33.764 --> 24:35.641
WOMAN:
Honey, look who it is.

24:37.143 --> 24:39.312
Do a sweep of the lobby.

24:39.353 --> 24:41.063
Helen Smith. 11:00.

24:41.105 --> 24:42.690
Please.

24:48.029 --> 24:49.947
RECEPTIONIST:
Davenport Women's Clinic.

24:49.989 --> 24:52.283
-How can I help you?
-(sniffles)

24:52.325 --> 24:55.578
Oh, no, I'm afraid she's not
in her office.

25:08.925 --> 25:10.259
All clear.

25:10.301 --> 25:12.261
Keep an eye on the exits.

25:19.518 --> 25:22.271
Mrs. Smith?
If you'll come with me.

25:30.613 --> 25:32.823
I'm afraid
we'll need you to wait here.

25:48.631 --> 25:50.633
(door opens)

26:24.000 --> 26:25.501
Hi.

26:29.714 --> 26:32.091
It's right through there, ma'am.

26:47.356 --> 26:50.151
Helen.

26:50.192 --> 26:52.278
I want to know what's going on.

26:52.320 --> 26:53.863
(door closes)

26:53.904 --> 26:55.990
(whispers):
Please come with me.

27:03.789 --> 27:05.875
JULIANA:
Did you search your apartment?

27:06.917 --> 27:08.961
HELEN:
Yeah.

27:09.003 --> 27:11.797
JULIANA:
And what did you find?

27:11.839 --> 27:15.301
HELEN:
Two canisters of film
in his desk drawer.

27:15.343 --> 27:16.510
And what did you see?

27:17.762 --> 27:20.139
(laughs):
Well, I can't explain it.

27:20.181 --> 27:21.349
It was us.

27:21.390 --> 27:24.018
It was me, John and... Thomas.

27:24.060 --> 27:25.853
We were eating ice cream
and horsing around.

27:25.895 --> 27:27.980
-But it never happened.
-It did happen, Helen.

27:28.022 --> 27:30.149
No. I have no memory of it.

27:30.191 --> 27:32.193
It's not just that.
It's not possible.

27:32.234 --> 27:33.986
Uh... somebody faked it,

27:34.028 --> 27:35.446
-I don't know how.
-If you thought

27:35.488 --> 27:36.822
it was a fake,
you wouldn't be here.

27:36.864 --> 27:39.992
And if it were a fake, your
husband wouldn't be watching it.

27:40.034 --> 27:43.204
(phone rings)

27:43.245 --> 27:45.206
JULIANA:
And there are other films

27:45.247 --> 27:46.082
like that.

27:46.123 --> 27:48.417
The "Allies Win."

27:48.459 --> 27:49.585
(sets down magazine)

27:51.837 --> 27:54.215
JULIANA:
You know, my sister died
smuggling that film.

27:54.256 --> 27:56.467
The first time I saw it,
it-it confirmed something in me

27:56.509 --> 27:58.511
that I-I'd suspected
all my life.

27:58.552 --> 28:00.054
If that world
is possible, Helen,

28:00.096 --> 28:02.056
this one can be transformed.
To watch that film

28:02.098 --> 28:04.141
is to know that
I had to make a choice.

28:04.183 --> 28:06.060
And, Helen,
now you have to make a choice.

28:07.728 --> 28:10.147
(nurses speaking indistinctly)

28:16.028 --> 28:17.905
Ma'am.

28:17.947 --> 28:20.950
Ma'am. I'm sorry, you'll have
to wait in the lobby.

28:20.991 --> 28:22.868
No one else gets in or out.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.933
In that world,
Thomas is still alive,

28:45.975 --> 28:48.269
and John has been to see him.

28:48.310 --> 28:49.937
How?

28:51.439 --> 28:53.315
The Reich has built a portal.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.569
They...

28:56.610 --> 28:59.029
built a por-portal?

29:00.781 --> 29:02.158
No.

29:02.199 --> 29:04.702
John would have told me.
My... my husband and I,

29:04.743 --> 29:06.537
we-we don't lie to each other.

29:06.579 --> 29:09.623
Whatever else has happened,
we have always had that.

29:09.665 --> 29:11.292
And yet he hid
the film from you.

29:15.337 --> 29:17.590
(laughs):
Okay, it's-it's all...

29:17.631 --> 29:19.508
it's... it's too much.

29:19.550 --> 29:21.510
Listen to me.
The Japanese

29:21.552 --> 29:23.846
have withdrawn from the West;
the Reich is moving in.

29:23.888 --> 29:27.141
Millions of people
are gonna die in those camps,

29:27.183 --> 29:29.018
just like they did
the first time, and your husband

29:29.059 --> 29:30.311
is in charge of it all.

29:30.352 --> 29:32.146
You don't know my husband.

29:32.188 --> 29:33.439
No, you don't know your husband.

29:34.648 --> 29:35.816
I'm sorry,

29:35.858 --> 29:38.235
I must have taken a wrong turn.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.779
Is there a...
bathroom on this floor?

29:42.281 --> 29:44.700
No, ma'am. Uh...

29:44.742 --> 29:47.620
you'll have to go
back up the stairs.

29:47.661 --> 29:49.830
I'm going to have
this whole floor searched.

29:49.872 --> 29:51.207
-Stay here.
-All right.

29:53.334 --> 29:55.127
(grunting)

29:59.924 --> 30:02.343
(grunting continues)

30:06.013 --> 30:08.307
-What do you want from me?
-The Reichsmarschall has

30:08.349 --> 30:10.476
an elite security detail--
he's never out in the open.

30:10.518 --> 30:12.353
But we know that he travels
to the portal by train.

30:12.394 --> 30:15.022
We need to know when and where.

30:15.064 --> 30:16.899
Aah! Aah, fuck!

30:16.941 --> 30:18.400
HELEN:
You want me

30:18.442 --> 30:20.945
to tell you the location
so you can murder him?

30:20.986 --> 30:23.239
Well, it's him
or millions of others.

30:26.325 --> 30:28.202
(groans, pants)

30:28.244 --> 30:30.913
(grunting)

30:30.955 --> 30:32.831
He is the father of my children.

30:32.873 --> 30:34.416
(clattering in distance)

30:34.458 --> 30:36.377
(grunting)

30:46.720 --> 30:49.306
-(gasps)
-(grunting)

31:00.192 --> 31:02.194
(gasping)

31:05.823 --> 31:06.949
(groaning gasp)

31:09.535 --> 31:10.536
(gasps)

31:11.412 --> 31:13.497
Oh, my God.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.557
(panting quietly)

31:41.275 --> 31:43.360
(panting)

31:51.827 --> 31:53.287
Let's go, please.

31:53.329 --> 31:56.165
I'm not feeling well.

31:56.206 --> 31:58.000
Can you call the car, please?

31:58.042 --> 31:59.793
Right away, ma'am.

32:04.882 --> 32:06.258
WYATT:
We're running out of time.

32:06.300 --> 32:08.802
(grunts)
Fuck. Here.

32:08.844 --> 32:12.431
They're gonna be down here...
looking for her.

32:12.473 --> 32:13.766
All right.

32:16.935 --> 32:19.313
(grunting)

32:24.193 --> 32:26.403
Let's go.

32:26.445 --> 32:29.823
The conquest
of the North American West...

32:29.865 --> 32:32.201
will unfold in stages.

32:32.242 --> 32:34.328
First, the Luftwaffe
will disable

32:34.370 --> 32:39.667
critical command-and-control
infrastructure...

32:39.708 --> 32:43.212
and carpet bomb
population centers...

32:43.253 --> 32:50.678
San Diego, Los Angeles, San
Francisco, Seattle, and so on.

32:50.719 --> 32:53.347
SMITH:
Forgive me, General...

32:53.389 --> 32:56.975
how much value to the Reich
will these cities have

32:57.017 --> 32:58.560
if they're reduced to rubble?

32:59.812 --> 33:01.230
The aerial assault

33:01.271 --> 33:03.982
will break the will
of the population.

33:04.024 --> 33:07.111
Next, our Panzer divisions
will cross the border

33:07.152 --> 33:08.987
from the Neutral Zone

33:09.029 --> 33:11.448
in a blitzkrieg strike.

33:11.490 --> 33:14.159
Supported
by our Wehrmacht battalions,

33:14.201 --> 33:16.161
we will have control
of the West Coast

33:16.203 --> 33:18.038
within a week.

33:20.833 --> 33:22.251
Smith.

33:24.044 --> 33:26.213
You are a skeptic?

33:28.090 --> 33:31.719
Invading the West is one thing,
Mein Fuhrer.

33:33.429 --> 33:35.431
Holding it is another.

33:37.349 --> 33:40.185
The BCR are crude savages.

33:40.227 --> 33:43.522
They rely on animal instinct.

33:43.564 --> 33:45.315
That's what
the Japanese thought.

33:47.359 --> 33:50.654
We use different methods,
Reichsmarschall,

33:50.696 --> 33:53.323
and they have never failed
to achieve results,

33:53.365 --> 33:54.825
as you know.

33:54.867 --> 33:56.577
Yes.

33:56.618 --> 34:00.080
The question is not whether...

34:00.122 --> 34:03.041
or how or when, Smith.

34:03.083 --> 34:06.336
For that is our destiny.

34:06.378 --> 34:08.964
The question...

34:09.006 --> 34:11.759
is who.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.469
Who...

34:13.510 --> 34:16.180
will lead the conquest

34:16.221 --> 34:18.640
of North America?

34:18.682 --> 34:20.976
A prize second only

34:21.018 --> 34:22.936
to Europa herself.

34:24.563 --> 34:27.399
Do you really believe

34:27.441 --> 34:29.568
that you deserve it, Smith?

34:29.610 --> 34:32.905
Or should I bestow it
on someone else?

34:32.946 --> 34:33.947
Eichmann, perhaps?

34:33.989 --> 34:34.948
Or Goertzmann?

34:34.990 --> 34:37.034
EICHMANN:
Mein Fuhrer,

34:37.075 --> 34:40.496
perhaps this duty
can only be entrusted

34:40.537 --> 34:43.165
to a member of the German...

34:43.207 --> 34:44.416
...master race.

34:45.834 --> 34:48.003
What do you say to that, Smith?

34:49.838 --> 34:51.673
I disagree.

34:53.258 --> 34:54.885
That is all?

34:56.845 --> 35:00.015
(takes deep breath)

35:00.057 --> 35:03.936
America is a rebel nation,
Mein Fuhrer.

35:03.977 --> 35:06.772
A German commander might--

35:06.814 --> 35:09.107
if you'll forgive me--

35:09.149 --> 35:13.362
promote unrest in the military.

35:13.403 --> 35:16.114
Only an American
can truly control it.

35:16.156 --> 35:19.368
But you do not control
America, Smith.

35:19.409 --> 35:21.453
Rebellion is rampant,

35:21.495 --> 35:24.832
and I have a bullet wound
to prove it.

35:25.999 --> 35:28.001
EICHMANN:
Is the problem

35:28.043 --> 35:30.879
that he can't control America?

35:32.714 --> 35:35.259
Or is it that he won't?

35:35.300 --> 35:39.221
What are you insinuating,
Eichmann?

35:39.263 --> 35:42.850
HIMMLER:
He is asking where
your true loyalties lie, Smith.

35:42.891 --> 35:46.603
And I have been wondering
the same thing myself.

35:46.645 --> 35:49.565
But tonight, at last,

35:49.606 --> 35:53.819
we are all going
to learn the truth

35:53.861 --> 35:57.364
about John Smith.

35:57.406 --> 35:59.366
(elevator bell dings)

36:00.409 --> 36:01.535
(elevator bell dings)

36:11.837 --> 36:13.297
(breath trembling)

36:13.338 --> 36:15.757
(Bridget crying nearby)

36:27.185 --> 36:28.604
Bridget?

36:28.645 --> 36:30.564
What's the matter?

36:30.606 --> 36:32.024
Why are you crying?

36:37.070 --> 36:38.822
(mouthing)

37:17.527 --> 37:20.030
HOOVER:
The ARBI's mission

37:20.072 --> 37:23.951
is to closely monitor
the ideological purity

37:23.992 --> 37:25.702
of its citizens.

37:25.744 --> 37:28.372
No one can be above suspicion.

37:33.460 --> 37:36.129
John Smith's allegiance came
into question

37:36.171 --> 37:39.716
when his wife left the Reich
for the Neutral Zone.

37:46.390 --> 37:48.308
(Himmler coughing)

37:50.018 --> 37:52.896
Before that, an assassination
attempt was made

37:52.938 --> 37:57.234
on our Fuhrer's life
that Smith let go unanswered.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.319
The question is why.

37:59.361 --> 38:02.656
Smith, do you have no answer?

38:04.950 --> 38:07.160
I crushed the rebellion
in Denver.

38:07.202 --> 38:08.829
That was my answer.

38:08.870 --> 38:10.872
And yet Price remains at large.

38:10.914 --> 38:13.125
How is that?

38:16.420 --> 38:18.380
Is my loyalty in question?

38:18.422 --> 38:20.382
Not just yours.

38:23.677 --> 38:26.888
SMITH (on tape):
You were questioning
Reich policy.

38:26.930 --> 38:28.598
HELEN:
Everything I said was true.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.642
You have the same doubts.

38:30.684 --> 38:33.145
SMITH:
Yes, and I keep them to myself.

38:33.186 --> 38:34.771
HOOVER:
Universal surveillance.

38:34.813 --> 38:37.149
Special cameras
and microphones mounted

38:37.190 --> 38:39.276
in public and private places.

38:39.317 --> 38:40.986
Nothing goes unseen.

38:41.028 --> 38:42.320
Show me a plan.

38:50.912 --> 38:53.749
(quietly):
I found this today.

38:53.790 --> 38:56.251
HELEN:
I've never seen him
this bad before.

38:56.293 --> 38:59.671
He's one coughing fit away from
having you eliminated, John.

38:59.713 --> 39:02.132
All of us.

39:02.174 --> 39:03.508
SMITH:
I know.

39:16.271 --> 39:18.523
JENNIFER:
I don't want to stay here.

39:18.565 --> 39:20.692
-HELEN: Jennifer...
-I could go live
with Uncle Hank on my own.

39:20.734 --> 39:22.444
We've been out there before.
We know where it is.

39:22.486 --> 39:23.945
HELEN:
No, no, no, stop it, stop it.

39:23.987 --> 39:25.655
You can't talk like that
anymore,

39:25.697 --> 39:26.948
not even in this house.

39:26.990 --> 39:28.075
JENNIFER:
Why not?

39:28.116 --> 39:31.161
Who's listening?

39:31.203 --> 39:33.205
Someday I'm going
to get out of here.

39:33.246 --> 39:36.291
-Gonna live my own life.
-Someday I'll help you.

39:36.333 --> 39:38.877
JENNIFER:
You know that cooking show
she did?

39:38.919 --> 39:40.837
It's all an act.

39:40.879 --> 39:43.465
She's back to playing
the perfect Reich wife.

39:43.507 --> 39:45.383
My parents are at the top
of the Nazi party.

39:45.425 --> 39:47.636
They're both dying inside.

39:47.677 --> 39:50.097
HELEN:
Things are different out here,
John.

39:50.138 --> 39:51.515
People talk about the things

39:51.556 --> 39:54.059
that nobody talks about
in the Reich.

39:54.101 --> 39:56.353
-SMITH: What things?
-HELEN: The things

39:56.394 --> 39:58.146
that you and I were a part of.

39:58.188 --> 40:00.065
The girls, they've heard it,
they ask me questions...

40:00.107 --> 40:02.442
SMITH:
You got any idea
what would happen to them

40:02.484 --> 40:05.862
if they breathed a word
of that at home?

40:14.538 --> 40:19.042
This is your last chance to
defend yourself and your family.

40:19.084 --> 40:21.336
Speak, John Smith.

40:24.089 --> 40:28.343
I ask you, gentlemen,
is this man a believer?

40:28.385 --> 40:29.469
(Himmler coughing)

40:31.596 --> 40:35.100
HOOVER:
Is this the face of a true
National Socialist,

40:35.142 --> 40:38.436
or the mask for which he hides
behind to protect his family?

40:38.478 --> 40:40.313
(Himmler coughing)

40:43.775 --> 40:47.195
Bring the Reichsmarschall
to my chambers in one hour.

40:48.738 --> 40:51.867
(Himmler coughing)

40:51.908 --> 40:54.494
(soldiers click heels)

41:00.542 --> 41:02.836
(line ringing)

41:02.878 --> 41:03.837
Good evening.

41:03.879 --> 41:05.463
John Smith's room, please.

41:05.505 --> 41:09.384
We don't have a reservation
for the Reichsmarschall, ma'am.

41:14.181 --> 41:16.183
(shudders)

41:25.692 --> 41:27.694
-Danke schon.
-Ja.

41:33.283 --> 41:35.410
Your sidearm, please.

42:01.061 --> 42:05.440
HIMMLER (coughs):
Margarete and I have
three daughters.

42:06.983 --> 42:09.277
(chuckles softly)

42:09.319 --> 42:12.572
Those girls are the greatest joy
of my life. (coughs)

42:16.076 --> 42:18.453
You know how it is.

42:21.289 --> 42:23.250
(coughs)

42:23.291 --> 42:27.254
But there are certain things
that a daughter can never be.

42:27.295 --> 42:31.841
When a man gets to be my age,
he needs a son.

42:45.814 --> 42:48.858
I thought of you
as that son, John.

42:53.446 --> 42:57.909
I saw myself in you.

42:57.951 --> 43:00.745
If anyone had hurt you...

43:00.787 --> 43:04.040
shot you,
as those assassins did me,

43:04.082 --> 43:05.959
I would have hunted them down

43:06.001 --> 43:08.628
and strangled them
with my bare hands.

43:10.630 --> 43:14.676
But you did nothing
to avenge me.

43:14.718 --> 43:16.970
Where's the tribute to the man
who gave you everything?

43:17.012 --> 43:20.849
When did you even visit me
when I was sick?

43:20.890 --> 43:22.100
Nothing.

43:25.395 --> 43:27.814
Say something, Smith.

43:27.856 --> 43:33.153
If not for yourself,
then for your family.

43:33.194 --> 43:35.488
Say something in your defense!

43:39.826 --> 43:42.579
What can I say, Mein Fuhrer?

43:42.620 --> 43:46.916
You're... You're right.

43:52.255 --> 43:54.174
I never loved you.

43:54.215 --> 43:55.467
(coughs)

43:55.508 --> 43:57.510
I never saw you as a, a father.

43:57.552 --> 44:02.807
I saw you as a...
a petty little tyrant.

44:02.849 --> 44:05.769
-You're a mediocre man.
-(coughs)

44:05.810 --> 44:07.812
A failed chicken farmer.

44:07.854 --> 44:09.939
(coughing violently)

44:09.981 --> 44:11.649
The very thought that you see
yourself in me...

44:11.691 --> 44:13.735
it sickens me.

44:13.777 --> 44:15.779
(coughing)

44:18.281 --> 44:20.533
(tank hissing)

44:32.754 --> 44:35.507
(muffled screaming)

44:46.768 --> 44:49.229
(muffled screaming)

44:49.270 --> 44:51.147
(groaning)

44:55.443 --> 44:57.445
(groaning stops)

45:04.577 --> 45:05.829
(hissing stops)

45:15.547 --> 45:17.715
SMITH:
See that the tank
is disposed of.

45:22.345 --> 45:24.347
(elevator bell dings)

45:39.863 --> 45:42.740
GOERTZMANN:
"Only an American
can rule America."

45:42.782 --> 45:44.993
I found your words quite moving.

45:45.034 --> 45:49.122
But it seems they found
your speech unpersuasive.

45:51.499 --> 45:55.420
The others were, uh,
more pragmatic.

46:03.178 --> 46:04.679
Hmm.

46:06.431 --> 46:08.433
I left Hoover for you.

46:08.475 --> 46:10.477
(footstep)

46:32.123 --> 46:35.168
I am not gonna beg for my life.

46:35.210 --> 46:37.170
No.

46:37.212 --> 46:39.672
I wouldn't listen, anyway.

46:45.053 --> 46:46.137
(grunts)

46:51.017 --> 46:53.019
(Smith grunting)

46:57.106 --> 46:59.108
(grunts)

47:13.957 --> 47:17.126
Our deal stands.

47:17.168 --> 47:20.463
North America is yours.

47:20.505 --> 47:23.591
And the rest of the Reich
is yours.

47:23.633 --> 47:26.970
You have complete autonomy.

47:29.305 --> 47:32.767
Heil Goertzmann.

47:32.809 --> 47:35.103
Heil Smith.
