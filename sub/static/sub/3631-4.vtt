Okay, you're making Logan
here feel inadequate.

insecurities onto me.

15:46.039 --> 15:47.172
Hey.

15:47.174 --> 15:49.041
How's everything in the big city?

15:49.043 --> 15:50.409
Not bad,

15:50.411 --> 15:52.878
other than your side of
the bed being too cold.

15:52.880 --> 15:55.681
I miss you too.

15:55.683 --> 15:57.750

15:57.752 --> 15:59.651

16:03.991 --> 16:06.424

16:06.426 --> 16:07.792
That's sweet, uh,

16:07.794 --> 16:10.929
but you know there's
so much going on and...

16:10.931 --> 16:12.764
How's the vodka campaign coming?

16:12.766 --> 16:14.266
It's not bad.

16:14.268 --> 16:15.933
Once I get a few of the
creative pieces in place,

16:15.935 --> 16:18.002
it should be pretty fantastic.

about wolves in your area.</i>

16:22.676 --> 16:25.209
They say, like, a wolf killed
a couple guys at a rave.

16:26.746 --> 16:29.647
Oh, yeah, right, um...
Well, you know the press,

16:29.649 --> 16:32.149
they blow things out of proportion.

16:32.151 --> 16:34.818
The wolf was killed anyway, so
there's nothing to worry about.

And why now?

17:28.807 --> 17:30.740
That's what we have to find out.

17:32.976 --> 17:34.644
What's the plan?

17:34.646 --> 17:37.279
Do you remember the last time the
Pack had troubles like this?

17:39.115 --> 17:41.350
- That was many years ago.
- Mm.

17:41.352 --> 17:44.153
We were Nick and Clay's age.

17:44.155 --> 17:46.288
Your father was the Pack Alpha.

17:48.024 --> 17:50.492
The old days of the Mutt hunts,

17:50.494 --> 17:52.928
when we would start at the
bottom of the Mutt food chain

17:52.930 --> 17:55.330
and we would work our way to the top.

17:55.332 --> 17:58.500
Until all the Mutts finally
capitulated to Pack rules.

18:00.069 --> 18:03.071
So that's the plan,
a full-out Mutt hunt.

18:03.073 --> 18:06.407
Antonio, there's a part of me

18:06.409 --> 18:09.243
that would like to
slaughter every last one.

18:12.147 --> 18:14.715
Pete's death was avoidable.

18:14.717 --> 18:17.185
It only happened because
I became complacent.

18:17.187 --> 18:19.820
You can't blame yourself. I'm the Alpha!

18:19.822 --> 18:23.291
It is my job to keep my Pack safe.

18:23.293 --> 18:25.259
We lost a brother

18:25.261 --> 18:27.294
because we, <i>we,</i>

18:27.296 --> 18:29.897
all underestimated the threat out there.

18:29.899 --> 18:32.633
We all thought it was a rogue.

18:32.635 --> 18:35.369
And now it looks like we're
dealing with something bigger.

18:35.371 --> 18:37.805
But let's not let our grief

18:37.807 --> 18:39.573
and our desire for revenge

18:39.575 --> 18:41.709
cloud the issue,

18:41.711 --> 18:44.177
which is that the Pack is us:

18:44.179 --> 18:47.947
you, me, the boys, and Elena.

18:47.949 --> 18:50.183
Yes, you are the Alpha,

18:50.185 --> 18:52.486
our leader.

It was great to get out
for a run, wasn't it?

19:19.247 --> 19:21.880
The run was fine.

19:21.882 --> 19:24.750
Everything else was a mistake.

19:24.752 --> 19:26.618
Was it?

19:26.620 --> 19:29.221
Yes.

19:29.223 --> 19:32.758
And I wanted to make sure
you were clear on that.

We're clear, darlin'.

( ♪ )

19:45.039 --> 19:47.539
So how do you want to play this?

19:47.541 --> 19:49.207
Do we start spilling Mutt blood?

19:49.209 --> 19:50.908
Not yet. There's still
too many unknowns,

19:50.910 --> 19:53.811
and we cannot risk another loss.

19:53.813 --> 19:56.948
And I may be placing the
sins of the few on the many.

19:56.950 --> 19:59.517
Might not be smart to risk the
backlash of the majority of Mutts

19:59.519 --> 20:02.420
if they have nothing to do with this.

20:02.422 --> 20:04.322
What do you need me to do?

20:04.324 --> 20:06.857
First thing is I need you to
tie up Pete's loose ends.

20:06.859 --> 20:09.760
- It's already in the works.
- Good.

20:09.762 --> 20:12.964
And then I need you to reach out
to the other Pack families.

20:12.966 --> 20:16.433
If this Mutt activity is
solely directed at Stonehaven,

20:16.435 --> 20:18.368
it is meant to unseat me.

20:18.370 --> 20:20.304
Well, if it is,

20:20.306 --> 20:22.306
we'll be ready to deal with it.

- Morning, Emerson.
- Ah, Karen.

20:35.187 --> 20:37.121
Yeah, well, you'll come around.

20:37.123 --> 20:38.822
And when you do,

20:38.824 --> 20:41.091
I've got the perfect
bait for you right here.

20:41.093 --> 20:42.492
Salted minnows.

20:42.494 --> 20:44.995
I do them myself. Special blend.

20:44.997 --> 20:46.663
Yeah, they're so effective,

20:46.665 --> 20:48.231
they ought to be against the law.

20:48.233 --> 20:50.299

20:59.477 --> 21:00.743
(Sigh)

21:00.745 --> 21:03.979
What can you tell me about
the Danvers family?

21:03.981 --> 21:05.181
The Danvers.

21:05.183 --> 21:07.650
There's an interesting bunch.

21:07.652 --> 21:09.818
I'm sure you've heard all the rumours.

21:09.820 --> 21:13.122
Pfff! I've heard...
mafia, devil worship,

- Am I missing anything?
- Mm-mmm.

Sounds like you're right up to speed.

21:18.863 --> 21:21.030
You ever had any dealings with them?

21:21.032 --> 21:24.499
Well, I only had occasion to
go out to Stonehaven once.

21:24.501 --> 21:26.401
Couple of years before I retired.

21:26.403 --> 21:28.370
A telephone worker,

21:28.372 --> 21:32.807
he was out stringing wire along the
Danvers' western property line.

21:32.809 --> 21:34.942
The fella just vanished.

21:34.944 --> 21:37.011
I mean, we found his truck eventually,

21:37.013 --> 21:39.047
bottom of a ravine, but...

21:39.049 --> 21:41.349
no one ever heard from him again.

21:41.351 --> 21:44.118
Did you think the Danvers had something
to do with his disappearance?

21:44.120 --> 21:46.320
We never found a body.

21:48.057 --> 21:50.992
I'm not sure that a criminal
act was even committed,

21:50.994 --> 21:55.763
but some people speculated that, uh,

21:55.765 --> 21:58.666
he might have seen something
out of Stonehaven

21:58.668 --> 22:00.201
he wasn't supposed to.

22:01.969 --> 22:04.405
Why, you having some
problems with the Danvers?

22:04.407 --> 22:07.607
No, but it appears somebody is.

22:07.609 --> 22:10.276
You talking about the body of
that Richardson boy you found?

22:10.278 --> 22:12.813
Yeah, it was dumped
on Stonehaven property.

22:12.815 --> 22:15.481
So I'm guessing either Mr. Danvers
has some serious enemies

22:15.483 --> 22:19.419
or someone from town has a hell
of a chip on their shoulder.

22:19.421 --> 22:20.620
Yeah...

22:20.622 --> 22:22.355
There's something...

22:22.357 --> 22:23.823
there's something about that family

22:23.825 --> 22:25.258
that just doesn't sit right with me.

22:25.260 --> 22:27.594
I felt the same way for 30 years.

22:29.363 --> 22:30.896
All right.

22:30.898 --> 22:32.865
Take a longer look
at the Danvers family.

22:32.867 --> 22:34.534
But be careful.

22:34.536 --> 22:37.937
I don't want to see you wind up
like that telephone lineman.

22:37.939 --> 22:39.271
I can take care of myself.

22:39.273 --> 22:41.941
I know that. Be careful just the same.

22:49.582 --> 22:52.284

I sent Antonio to deal with the fallout

22:52.286 --> 22:53.853
from Pete's disappearance,

22:53.855 --> 22:55.520
and bring the other
families up to speed.

22:55.522 --> 22:58.290
In the meantime, we have
two Mutts to deal with.

22:58.292 --> 23:01.025
For starters, we need to identify
the dead one from the rave

23:01.027 --> 23:02.961
and find out who made him.

23:02.963 --> 23:06.030
Nick, you and Logan go to the
flophouse where he lived.

23:06.032 --> 23:08.166
Turn it upside down.

23:08.168 --> 23:10.068
Wipe it clean when you're finished.

23:10.070 --> 23:11.870
- Got it.
- I'm supposed to be speaking

23:11.872 --> 23:13.872
at a psychology conference
tonight and tomorrow.

23:13.874 --> 23:16.607
I can handle the flophouse by myself.

23:16.609 --> 23:19.443
Okay. I want you to be very careful.

23:19.445 --> 23:21.179
All of you.

23:21.181 --> 23:24.015
We thought the threat was over
when the first Mutt died.

23:24.017 --> 23:26.785
And Pete paid for our mistake.

23:26.787 --> 23:28.952
We know better now.

23:28.954 --> 23:31.389
Clay, I want you and
Elena to go into town.

23:31.391 --> 23:33.391
Assess the mood of the locals.

23:33.393 --> 23:34.925
More importantly, I want to see

23:34.927 --> 23:36.994
if you can pick up the
scent of the new killer.

23:36.996 --> 23:38.663
If he's in town, we'll find him.

23:38.665 --> 23:41.666

Excuse me. Can I help you?

26:55.650 --> 26:57.149
I'm looking for Peter Myers.

He's taking some time off.

26:58.553 --> 27:00.586

27:14.035 --> 27:15.901
What kind of investigation?

27:15.903 --> 27:17.502
Well, I can't divulge the details,

27:17.504 --> 27:19.805
but we're working in

27:19.807 --> 27:21.940

27:21.942 --> 27:23.775

The Bureau would really

28:51.129 --> 28:52.794
I need her to start on the presentation

28:52.796 --> 28:55.231

No. Well, you've been
friends for almost a year.

29:03.439 --> 29:05.973
Yeah, but, okay, you've been
sleeping with her for six months.

29:05.975 --> 29:08.409
If she's going to tell
anyone, it would be you.

29:08.411 --> 29:09.577

I mean, hey, don't get me wrong,

29:12.481 --> 29:14.615
having a few secrets is fine, but...

29:14.617 --> 29:17.084

I'm just surprised it didn't
come up in conversation.

29:21.924 --> 29:23.924
There's an invisible line with Elena

29:23.926 --> 29:25.625
and if you accidentally cross it,

29:25.627 --> 29:27.528
she gets... evasive.

29:27.530 --> 29:29.796
That is not healthy, Philip.

29:29.798 --> 29:31.131
John was evasive with me,

29:31.133 --> 29:33.167
and one day he packed his bags and left.

29:33.169 --> 29:35.202
Yeah, that is not what's happening here.

29:35.204 --> 29:36.937
No, I know you two are
crazy about each other.

29:36.939 --> 29:38.538
But lack of communication

29:38.540 --> 29:40.306
is the first step in disengagement.

29:40.308 --> 29:41.975
Do not let that happen.

29:41.977 --> 29:44.077
I never thought I'd be
getting relationship advice

29:46.514 --> 29:49.950
Remember, I told you
to dump Julie Hamilton.

29:49.952 --> 29:51.818
- I was 10.
- Yeah.

wasn't right for you.

29:55.356 --> 29:58.357
Just like now, I can tell Elena is.

Look, Philip, she's...
she's not fragile.

30:00.261 --> 30:01.961
Just sit her down and talk to her.

30:19.446 --> 30:21.580
That Mutt really stirred things up.

All the more reason to find
him quickly and put him down.

By the way, thanks for
watching my back in there.

30:30.657 --> 30:32.690
It's nice to know you still care.

30:32.692 --> 30:34.025
Last thing we needed

30:34.027 --> 30:36.294
was for you to get into a
brawl with the locals.

30:36.296 --> 30:38.029
So... I can handle confrontation

30:38.031 --> 30:40.198

a room on the first floor.

36:58.384 --> 36:59.917

37:19.472 --> 37:21.872

If they were to take
us out, it'd be chaos.

law, these Mutts can run wild.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.122

37:39.124 --> 37:41.824
our society would be revealed

38:44.184 --> 38:45.351
(Sigh)

38:53.326 --> 38:55.127
We'll go in quietly.

38:55.129 --> 38:56.695
Clay, you and Elena go
through the front door,

38:56.697 --> 38:58.864
Nick and I will go in
through the adjoining room.

38:58.866 --> 39:00.465
And if the Mutts are here?

39:00.467 --> 39:02.701
We take them alive. We'll try.

39:04.170 --> 39:05.971
We'll try hard.

39:05.973 --> 39:09.715

39:15.849 --> 39:18.150
Nice place.

39:18.152 --> 39:19.884
(Sniffing)

39:19.886 --> 39:22.220
Lavender.

39:22.222 --> 39:24.288
Is your girlfriend taking a bath?

39:26.091 --> 39:28.626
You know, I was actually
just on my way out.

39:28.628 --> 39:30.394
I know.

39:30.396 --> 39:33.665
Keynote speaker at a
psychology conference.

39:33.667 --> 39:35.466
Impressive.

39:35.468 --> 39:37.168
Especially for someone your age.

39:37.170 --> 39:39.604
What are you doing here?

39:39.606 --> 39:41.138
Came here to talk to you

39:41.140 --> 39:42.839
about the situation at Stonehaven.

39:42.841 --> 39:44.708
Why me?

39:44.710 --> 39:46.643
Because...

39:46.645 --> 39:48.479
you're a rational guy.

39:50.482 --> 39:53.117
And because the Danvers
family hates my guts.

40:02.760 --> 40:06.162
Word of the attacks in
Bear Valley has spread.

40:06.164 --> 40:08.832
It sounds like those two
killers are working in tandem.

40:08.834 --> 40:10.333
When have you ever known Mutts

40:10.335 --> 40:12.168
to be in league with one another?

40:12.170 --> 40:14.704
- Bound to happen sometime.
- Why?

40:14.706 --> 40:16.706
Eventually they're going to get tired

40:16.708 --> 40:18.941
of the Pack imposing rules

40:18.943 --> 40:21.544
and push back.

40:21.546 --> 40:23.779
I shouldn't have to explain that to you,

40:23.781 --> 40:25.148
doctor.

40:29.153 --> 40:31.854
Well, you would understand
the mind of a Mutt

40:31.856 --> 40:33.589
much better than I would, wouldn't you?

40:33.591 --> 40:37.192
You may think of me as a Mutt,

40:37.194 --> 40:39.428
but before you came around,

40:39.430 --> 40:41.363
I was pure Pack.

40:41.365 --> 40:44.600
My family dates back generations.

40:44.602 --> 40:46.135
Do I need to remind you

40:46.137 --> 40:48.537
that my great-great-
grandfather was Alpha?

40:55.111 --> 40:57.346
What do you want from me?

40:57.348 --> 41:00.782
Convince Jeremy and Clay to
let me come to Stonehaven.

41:00.784 --> 41:02.417
Let's talk about joining forces

41:02.419 --> 41:04.052
to deal with this situation.

41:06.555 --> 41:07.822
(Lock breaking)

41:11.627 --> 41:13.461
What about your relationship with Clay?

41:13.463 --> 41:16.297
He killed my brother.

41:16.299 --> 41:18.833
But I'm willing to look past it.

41:18.835 --> 41:20.801
It's collateral damage.

41:20.803 --> 41:23.304
If there was ever a time for
us to put our past behind us

41:23.306 --> 41:25.306
and to join forces, it's now.

41:33.448 --> 41:34.715
Clay!

Elena: (Panting)

41:43.091 --> 41:44.792
Jeremy: - You okay?
- Yeah.

41:44.794 --> 41:46.593
The whole town must have heard that.

41:46.595 --> 41:47.861
We need to go.
