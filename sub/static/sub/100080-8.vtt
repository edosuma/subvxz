You have a better idea
how to get out of this?

10:38.420 --> 10:40.901
[door unlocks, opens]

10:43.555 --> 10:44.818
Chris?

10:44.861 --> 10:47.385
Hey. I-I-I didn't know
you'd be home.

10:47.429 --> 10:49.344
I forgot my laptop.

10:49.387 --> 10:51.172
Why are you here?
I thought you were working.

10:51.215 --> 10:54.523
I was feeling off,
so I took a sick day.
Oh.

10:54.566 --> 10:57.178
I wish you would've told us.
Ty and I both have meetings,

10:57.221 --> 10:59.833
but we could've found a way
to be home, take care of you.

10:59.876 --> 11:02.357
I'm fine. Don't worry about it.Okay, well,

11:02.400 --> 11:04.881
there's some leftover risotto
in the fridge,

11:04.925 --> 11:07.014
or I can order you some soup,
have it delivered.

11:07.057 --> 11:08.232
Kira,
I said I'm fine.

11:08.276 --> 11:09.538
I can take care of myself,
all right?

11:09.581 --> 11:13.542
Okay, look, Chris,
I know I hurt you.

11:13.585 --> 11:18.286
Okay, it's complicated,
this thing between you and me,

11:18.329 --> 11:21.724
but just give it time, okay?
We'll make it work.

11:21.768 --> 11:23.900
Really?
Yeah.

11:23.944 --> 11:25.728
You, me, and Ty,
the three of us,

11:25.772 --> 11:29.297
we're so good together.
We'll figure it out, okay?

11:29.340 --> 11:31.038
I promise.

11:31.081 --> 11:33.301
I love you.

11:33.344 --> 11:35.607
All right,
I got to go.

11:35.651 --> 11:37.914
Feel better, okay?

11:48.620 --> 11:51.754
Sir, we got the blueprints
for the house.

11:51.798 --> 11:54.235
There's a crawl space that runs
underneath the entire house.

11:54.278 --> 11:56.411
We could use it
to get eyes inside.How would we approach?

11:56.454 --> 11:57.455
There's an entrance
by the one-four corner.

11:57.499 --> 11:59.588
We could use the arbor
for cover.

11:59.631 --> 12:01.155
We stay tight,
they won't see us coming.

12:01.198 --> 12:03.157
Okay. Tan, Street, you two
get the cameras up and running.

12:03.200 --> 12:04.593
I'll put the airship
in the sky

12:04.636 --> 12:05.899
to cover the sound
of the drills.

12:05.942 --> 12:07.770
Rocker, if Dixon's
in rough shape,

12:07.814 --> 12:10.381
I want your team ready
for emergency entrance.

12:12.470 --> 12:14.516
DEACON:
All right, we got movement.

12:14.559 --> 12:15.909
HONDO:
This is 20-David to Command.

12:15.952 --> 12:17.171
The package has been picked up.

12:17.214 --> 12:18.607
We'll keep eyes
on the one-side,

12:18.650 --> 12:20.130
direct the airship.

12:20.174 --> 12:21.349
HICKS:
Copy that.

12:21.392 --> 12:23.394
Let's get started.

12:27.659 --> 12:28.922
[phone ringing]

12:28.965 --> 12:31.576
Hey.

12:33.230 --> 12:34.318
Hello?

12:34.362 --> 12:36.712
HICKS:
Hello. Is this Pablo Fuentes?

12:36.756 --> 12:38.714
Yeah.Hey, Pablo.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.672
You can call me Bob.PABLO: Bob,

12:40.716 --> 12:42.805
you a cop?HICKS: Well... [chuckles]

12:42.849 --> 12:45.286
I work with cops on occasion.

12:45.329 --> 12:47.505
Pablo, can you tell me
how the deputy's doing?

12:47.549 --> 12:48.942
Is he okay?

12:48.985 --> 12:50.944
He's fine.That's good to hear.

12:50.987 --> 12:52.684
Can I speak with him?No, sir.

12:52.728 --> 12:54.991
Not until this circus
clears off my property.

12:55.035 --> 12:57.646
Well, I'm gonna try to get that
sorted out. Now, I've heard

12:57.689 --> 13:00.867
the police version of events.
I want to hear yours, Pablo.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.912
What happened this morning?

13:04.871 --> 13:06.307
They were banging
on the door,

13:06.350 --> 13:08.352
and wanted to evict us.

13:08.396 --> 13:10.659
My family's been here
since before I was born.

13:10.702 --> 13:14.750
We ain't leaving just 'cause
some corrupt judge orders us to.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.883
I understand, Pablo.
Tell me more.

13:16.926 --> 13:19.973
Tell me about your family.
When did they move here?

13:20.016 --> 13:22.323
Family records.My, uh, parents built this home

13:22.366 --> 13:24.238
in 1947, after the war.

13:24.281 --> 13:26.501
Grew that orange grove outside

13:26.544 --> 13:28.242
when there was
nothing but dead grass.

13:28.285 --> 13:30.679
They started their family here.

13:30.722 --> 13:32.855
My wife and I
started ours.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.988
My son started his.

13:35.031 --> 13:37.251
That's four generations
of Fuentes men

13:37.294 --> 13:39.079
have lived in this home,

13:39.122 --> 13:41.516
and they want to raze it
to the ground.

13:41.559 --> 13:44.867
This city don't care
about tradition.

13:44.911 --> 13:46.913
They want to erase me,

13:46.956 --> 13:48.349
erase my family.

13:48.392 --> 13:50.003
They just care about money.

13:50.046 --> 13:51.874
HICKS: I get it, Pablo.PABLO: No, you don't.

13:51.918 --> 13:53.615
HICKS: No, I do.PABLO: You can't.

13:53.658 --> 13:56.183
I understand that you lost
someone very important to you.

13:56.226 --> 13:58.054
You and your wife
made a life here,

13:58.098 --> 14:01.362
made a home where you two
brought your newborn.

14:01.405 --> 14:05.061
Every memory you ever had
with her, good and bad,

14:05.105 --> 14:07.281
it's written all over
those four walls.

14:07.324 --> 14:11.067
City can't pay you enough
to let go of that, am I right?

14:11.111 --> 14:13.417
Right.I understand, Pablo.

14:13.461 --> 14:16.246
I also lost someone
a few years ago.

14:16.290 --> 14:17.726
I know how it can be.

14:17.769 --> 14:20.947
Pablo, that man
with you inside--

14:20.990 --> 14:22.774
he has a wife, two daughters,

14:22.818 --> 14:25.212
a home like yours.

14:25.255 --> 14:27.431
He's just trying to get on
with life, same as you.

14:35.483 --> 14:36.745
Tan, Street, how we doing?

14:36.788 --> 14:37.920
Ready.Copy that.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.226
Airship 1, move in.

14:39.269 --> 14:41.141
[helicopter blades whirring]

14:50.193 --> 14:51.847
What are they doing?

14:58.332 --> 15:00.595
What're you doing up there?
You trying to get on my roof?

15:00.638 --> 15:02.814
Is this Ricardo?Answer me.

15:02.858 --> 15:04.991
It's just a media helicopter.
We're trying to get it away.

15:05.034 --> 15:06.340
Just bear with me,

15:06.383 --> 15:07.428
I need a little time to
communicate with them.

15:07.471 --> 15:08.951
You tell them
to get out of here,

15:08.995 --> 15:11.258
or I'm gonna kill your deputy.Now, there's no need

15:11.301 --> 15:12.781
for that, Ricardo.

15:12.824 --> 15:14.957
I just need a little bit
of time.Still don't see Dixon.

15:15.001 --> 15:16.350
He's not in any
of these rooms.

15:16.393 --> 15:18.874
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

15:18.918 --> 15:21.094
Dad! Mijo,stay here
with your mom.

15:21.137 --> 15:22.922
[helicopter blades
continue whirring]

15:33.149 --> 15:35.978
You have ten seconds
to get them away from here.

15:36.022 --> 15:37.240
Ten,

15:37.284 --> 15:39.329
I'm trying, Ricardo.
Bear with me.nine,

15:39.373 --> 15:41.201
eight, seven,

15:41.244 --> 15:44.291
six, five, four,

15:44.334 --> 15:45.814
three...[whispers]: We're good.

15:45.857 --> 15:46.989
Airship 1, get out of there.

15:50.384 --> 15:51.689
It's gone.

15:51.733 --> 15:54.997
Good.

16:13.581 --> 16:17.019
We need to make emergency entry.
Rocker, get ready.

16:17.063 --> 16:18.890
Street, Tan,
prep the flashbangs.

16:25.549 --> 16:27.334
[whispers]: Ready.Rocker?

16:27.377 --> 16:29.510
ROCKER:
Back door is rigged
with explosive charges,

16:29.553 --> 16:30.728
armed and ready.All right, on my call.

16:30.772 --> 16:32.252
[baby crying]

16:34.428 --> 16:37.170
Abort.
I repeat, abort.

16:37.213 --> 16:38.606
Hey, check on her.

16:38.649 --> 16:40.347
Damn helicopter
probably woke her up.

16:40.390 --> 16:42.262
HICKS:
Everyone return back to Command.

16:46.092 --> 16:48.529
How did we miss the baby?There was no birth certificate.

16:48.572 --> 16:51.401
[sighs] Geez.Maybe a home birth,
unregistered?

16:53.099 --> 16:55.275
Not sure if Dixon's
still breathing.We can't initiate entry

16:55.318 --> 16:57.190
as long as that baby's in there,

16:57.233 --> 16:59.018
and God knows who else,
for that matter.

17:01.933 --> 17:03.718
[phone rings]Yeah?

17:03.761 --> 17:05.372
Ricardo, I need to speak
with the deputy,

17:05.415 --> 17:07.200
make sure he's okay.
Can I talk with him?

17:07.243 --> 17:08.592
No way.

17:08.636 --> 17:11.073
His wife and his daughters
are asking about him.

17:11.117 --> 17:12.553
They're worried.

17:12.596 --> 17:16.383
Please, Ricardo,
I'm begging you...

17:16.426 --> 17:17.862
as a father.

17:24.782 --> 17:25.914
Hey, wake up.

17:25.957 --> 17:29.265
Your buddy
wants to talk.

17:31.267 --> 17:32.703
Wake up.[soft wheezing]

17:34.357 --> 17:36.185
He's... he's not waking up.

17:40.798 --> 17:42.844
He's-he's barely there.We need to get him

17:42.887 --> 17:45.020
medical attention immediately.RICARDO: Like hell you do.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.674
You're not stepping a foot
inside this house.

17:46.717 --> 17:48.502
If he dies...

17:48.545 --> 17:51.331
this becomes a very different
situation, Ricardo.

17:51.374 --> 17:53.855
Think of your future, man,
your family's.

17:53.898 --> 17:55.509
He's our only ticket
out of this.

17:55.552 --> 17:56.814
We're not letting go of him.

18:08.870 --> 18:10.437
Then take me.

18:10.480 --> 18:14.136
I'm a commander with the LAPD.
You won't lose any leverage.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.616
No way.I thought you said you only

18:15.659 --> 18:18.793
worked with the cops.HICKS: Let me come in, unarmed.

18:18.836 --> 18:21.143
I'll take his place, and you
let me get him to a hospital

18:21.187 --> 18:23.058
so no one in there
faces murder charges.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.104
[groaning softly]

18:32.415 --> 18:33.895
All right, deal.

18:33.938 --> 18:36.071
You try and pull a fast one,
and a bunch of people die.

18:41.250 --> 18:44.471
Commander. Commander, no way,
no how you're doing this.

18:44.514 --> 18:47.343
Dixon's barely hanging on, and
I'm not willing to put his life

18:47.387 --> 18:48.997
or that baby's life
in danger.

18:49.040 --> 18:51.173
Press is already camped out
on our doorstep.

18:51.217 --> 18:53.306
Last thing we need
is another Ruby Ridge.

18:53.349 --> 18:55.177
Well, let one of us
go instead. I'll go.

18:55.221 --> 18:57.179
With a wife and four kids
for me to answer to?

18:57.223 --> 18:59.094
Thanks, but no thanks.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.009
Look, I was making progress
with Pablo

19:01.052 --> 19:02.706
until his son
took the phone from him.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.055
I can work him in person.

19:04.099 --> 19:05.709
What do you need
from us?

19:05.753 --> 19:08.190
Hondo, you take over Command.
After we get Dixon to safety,

19:08.234 --> 19:10.192
our next priority
is to get that baby out.

19:10.236 --> 19:11.759
Once we do that,

19:11.802 --> 19:13.674
you make entry and put
an end to this thing.All right,

19:13.717 --> 19:15.415
we'll see and hear everything
from the camera feeds.

19:15.458 --> 19:18.548
What's your safe word?Um...

19:18.592 --> 19:20.246
July.

19:20.289 --> 19:22.030
Commander, are you sure
you're ready to do this?

19:22.073 --> 19:24.772
As ready as
I'll ever be.

19:24.815 --> 19:27.078
Deac, give me
your wedding ring.

19:32.083 --> 19:34.303
Don't worry, you'll get it back,
one way or another.

20:02.810 --> 20:04.812
Move.

20:09.164 --> 20:10.774
Can I check on him?

20:10.818 --> 20:12.689
All right, fast.

20:16.040 --> 20:18.434
Don't worry, pal, we're gonna
get you out of here.

20:18.478 --> 20:20.088
RICARDO:
All right, back.

20:24.527 --> 20:25.876
[chair scrapes the floor]

20:28.401 --> 20:29.924
Down.

20:49.944 --> 20:51.989
You try anything,

20:52.033 --> 20:54.165
my dad's got a gun
to your boss's head. Understood?

20:54.209 --> 20:55.341
Understood.

20:55.384 --> 20:58.561
[grunting]

20:58.605 --> 21:00.607
Go, go, go.
Come on, get inside.

21:04.567 --> 21:06.961
Move.

21:13.054 --> 21:14.621
[grunting]

21:14.664 --> 21:16.710
Move, move.

21:18.407 --> 21:20.409
[indistinct chatter]

21:22.106 --> 21:23.456
He gonna be okay?

21:23.499 --> 21:25.458
Well, he's lost a lot of blood.

21:25.501 --> 21:27.503
Get him in.

21:33.901 --> 21:36.207
[reporters clamoring]

21:36.251 --> 21:38.166
Who's the hotshot?

21:38.209 --> 21:40.342
That's Councilman Jenkins.
He's been the cheerleader behind

21:40.386 --> 21:42.126
this whole
development project.

21:42.170 --> 21:43.650
Thinks it'll bring in a lot
of money to the area.MOLLY: Jim!

21:43.693 --> 21:45.652
Jim!Molly?

21:45.695 --> 21:47.871
Can you tell him it's okay
to let me through?Hey!

21:47.915 --> 21:49.046
Hey, she's good.

21:51.745 --> 21:53.834
I saw on the news
that a SWAT officer

21:53.877 --> 21:55.836
swapped places with a hostage.

21:55.879 --> 21:57.838
You weren't picking up
your phone.

21:57.881 --> 22:00.319
I thought maybe
it was you.

22:01.885 --> 22:03.887
What is it?

22:04.975 --> 22:06.716
It's your dad.

22:08.239 --> 22:09.545
He gave himself up

22:09.589 --> 22:11.417
so a wounded hostage
could get released.

22:11.460 --> 22:14.376
What are you talking about?
My dad wears a suit.

22:14.420 --> 22:15.899
He doesn't do
the dangerous stuff anymore.

22:15.943 --> 22:17.379
Not usually.

22:18.728 --> 22:20.774
I genuinely believe that
we'll look back on this,

22:20.817 --> 22:23.385
five, ten years from now,

22:23.429 --> 22:25.256
and we'll see
the wealth and opportunities

22:25.300 --> 22:27.563
that we've created for the
residents of this district

22:27.607 --> 22:29.260
and we'll all
be grateful.You're a thief!

22:29.304 --> 22:30.958
MAN:
Nice!

22:31.001 --> 22:32.960
Hey, hey, hey.

22:33.003 --> 22:35.397
Hey, knock it off!All right, break it up!

22:35.441 --> 22:37.399
Just wait here, okay?

22:37.443 --> 22:39.793
Hey, break it up.How much are the developers
paying you?

22:39.836 --> 22:42.404
Did you throw that egg?

22:42.448 --> 22:44.145
JENKINS:
Officer, don't.

22:44.188 --> 22:45.538
There's already too much anger.

22:45.581 --> 22:46.930
I don't want to press charges.

22:46.974 --> 22:49.106
All right, move out,

22:49.150 --> 22:50.804
move out. Let's go or
we're gonna book you

22:50.847 --> 22:52.109
for disturbing
the peace. Come on.

22:54.938 --> 22:56.418
How long were you together?

22:58.942 --> 23:00.553
Oh.

23:00.596 --> 23:02.598
Just missed, um,

23:02.642 --> 23:05.079
45 years by three days.

23:05.122 --> 23:06.254
Wow.

23:06.297 --> 23:08.299
Yeah, I took that
just a few months

23:08.343 --> 23:10.084
before she passed.

23:10.127 --> 23:12.434
[chuckles]

23:12.478 --> 23:15.350
It's the last picture
I have of her.

23:21.835 --> 23:23.619
How about you?

23:25.621 --> 23:28.755
Would've been 36 years
this summer.

23:28.798 --> 23:31.453
Alzheimer's, early-onset.

23:33.150 --> 23:35.457
At the end, I, uh...

23:35.501 --> 23:37.459
I was a stranger to her.

23:40.027 --> 23:42.464
What do you
miss the most?

23:42.508 --> 23:45.293
PABLO:
Well, she liked to sing.

23:45.336 --> 23:47.338
Not professional or anything,

23:47.382 --> 23:49.340
but, you know,
when she'd be working.

23:49.384 --> 23:53.170
She had a sweet,
beautiful voice.

23:53.214 --> 23:56.173
What about you?HICKS: You know what I miss?

23:56.217 --> 23:58.219
The snoring.[chuckles]

23:58.262 --> 24:00.047
PABLO: What?HICKS [laughs]: Yeah.

24:00.090 --> 24:02.876
Oh, it used to drive me crazy
when we were first married.

24:02.919 --> 24:04.965
I had to wake up
in the middle of the night,

24:05.008 --> 24:07.402
I'd have to push her onto her
side just to get her to stop.

24:07.446 --> 24:10.492
Even pushed her off the bed
by accident one night.

24:10.536 --> 24:13.364
And if she ever fell asleep
before me, forget it.

24:13.408 --> 24:14.975
It was game over.

24:15.018 --> 24:17.978
And then, one night,
I just finally managed

24:18.021 --> 24:19.632
to sleep the whole night.

24:19.675 --> 24:21.677
Just adapted, I guess.

24:25.376 --> 24:27.901
Now it's the silence
that keeps me up.

24:30.251 --> 24:33.080
Still haven't gotten
used to that.

24:34.560 --> 24:37.388
I, um, tried dating
a couple of times once,

24:37.432 --> 24:40.000
but that didn't feel right,
so I stopped.

24:40.043 --> 24:43.307
Strained the relationship
with my son even more, so...

24:44.439 --> 24:46.223
[scoffs]

24:46.267 --> 24:48.835
I've spent so much time
wishing for the past

24:48.878 --> 24:51.533
that I screwed up
my present and...

24:51.577 --> 24:53.796
probably even my future.

24:56.582 --> 24:59.236
You don't need to make
that mistake, Pablo.

25:00.281 --> 25:01.761
Well...

25:01.804 --> 25:03.763
well, it feels
like I already have.

25:03.806 --> 25:05.025
No.

25:05.068 --> 25:07.462
There's still a way out of this.

25:07.506 --> 25:08.898
It's entirely up to you.[whispers]: Hey.

25:08.942 --> 25:10.247
Been looking
all over for you.

25:10.291 --> 25:11.945
Molly, you can't
be in here.

25:11.988 --> 25:13.381
Street.Yeah, I'm on it. Sorry, Hondo.

25:13.424 --> 25:15.209
HICKS:
Think about your family.

25:15.252 --> 25:18.212
Think about what's best
for your grandkids.

25:18.255 --> 25:20.693
It doesn't have to end

25:20.736 --> 25:22.564
like this.

25:22.608 --> 25:24.653
I never meant
for this to happen.

25:30.180 --> 25:32.792
Miguel needs help
with the bedroom window.

25:32.835 --> 25:35.577
You go.
I'll watch him.

25:38.101 --> 25:39.755
You know, it's strange--

25:39.799 --> 25:41.888
hearing him talk about Mom.

25:41.931 --> 25:45.108
It's almost impossible to get
him to open up about her.

25:47.807 --> 25:49.286
Let's go.

25:52.681 --> 25:54.640
You a Dodgers fan?

25:54.683 --> 25:56.076
Sure.

25:56.119 --> 25:58.600
Played for their Low A team,
in fact. Two years.

25:58.644 --> 26:01.255
How about that?Mm.

26:01.298 --> 26:02.822
They got a nice
stadium, don't they?

26:02.865 --> 26:05.302
Built in 1959.

26:05.346 --> 26:07.304
You know what was there before?

26:07.348 --> 26:09.611
Chavez Ravine.A whole neighborhood
of Latinos

26:09.655 --> 26:13.180
living peacefully until the city
told them they had to get out.

26:13.223 --> 26:15.182
The sheriff came.

26:15.225 --> 26:17.750
Dragged the women out
of their homes by their hair.

26:17.793 --> 26:19.447
Beat the men.

26:19.490 --> 26:21.275
I'm not gonna let
that happen again.

26:21.318 --> 26:23.103
And neither
is my dad.

26:23.146 --> 26:26.628
So stop poisoning his head
with your crap.

26:26.672 --> 26:28.021
You talk again,

26:28.064 --> 26:29.936
I'll break
your mouth.

26:29.979 --> 26:31.502
[baby crying]

26:31.546 --> 26:34.549
Lupe! What's
wrong with her?

26:34.593 --> 26:36.116
LUPE:
She's hungry.

26:36.159 --> 26:39.728
So feed her.I can't. The water's off.

26:45.212 --> 26:46.822
I'll take care of it.

26:48.824 --> 26:49.999
Watch him.

26:56.571 --> 26:58.704
Aw.

26:58.747 --> 27:00.140
Look at her.

27:00.183 --> 27:02.882
Hey.

27:02.925 --> 27:05.319
You want to get your baby
out of here?

27:05.362 --> 27:07.016
Keep her safe?

27:12.195 --> 27:14.545
Yes.

27:14.589 --> 27:15.982
I'll figure something
out, Ricardo.

27:16.025 --> 27:17.984
You just give me some
time to get it arranged.

27:18.027 --> 27:20.203
What's he want?

27:20.247 --> 27:22.989
He wants formula for the baby.

27:23.032 --> 27:25.905
All right, Deacon, we'll use the
drop as a diversion to get Lupe,

27:25.948 --> 27:27.950
the baby and Hicks out
through that kitchen window.

27:36.524 --> 27:38.700
Command to 50-David.
Are you ready?

27:38.744 --> 27:39.962
ROCKER:
Ready.

27:40.006 --> 27:42.008
Deacon, let's get you
into position.

27:42.051 --> 27:43.052
DEACON:
Roger that.

27:45.881 --> 27:46.882
In position.

27:46.926 --> 27:48.057
All right, Deacon,
they're alone.

27:51.931 --> 27:54.324
He heard you.

27:58.764 --> 28:00.374
RICARDO:
Took long enough.
Where's the formula?

28:00.417 --> 28:02.724
We're delivering it to you
right now, Ricardo.

28:02.768 --> 28:06.075
Just make it quick.
Miguel, go watch him.

28:07.642 --> 28:10.079
Take this.

28:17.304 --> 28:20.089
Rocker, deliver the package,
but take it as slow as possible

28:20.133 --> 28:21.612
without raising any suspicion.

28:23.310 --> 28:25.399
ROCKER [on loudspeaker]:
Okay, Ricardo, we're
gonna approach

28:25.442 --> 28:26.574
nice and slow.

28:26.617 --> 28:27.967
No surprises.

28:35.104 --> 28:36.279
Miguel.

28:36.323 --> 28:37.759
Go back to
your father.

28:37.803 --> 28:39.108
I'll keep an eye on him.

28:39.152 --> 28:40.762
Dad said...I know what he said,

28:40.806 --> 28:43.286
but I don't want that door open
any longer than it needs to be.

28:43.330 --> 28:47.073
As soon as we get the formula,
I want it locked up.

28:47.116 --> 28:50.293
Go help him.Okay.

28:55.821 --> 28:57.997
[door closes]

28:58.040 --> 28:59.650
Come on, come on, go, go.

29:01.130 --> 29:02.653
[whispers]: All right.
Come on, come on, come on.

29:02.697 --> 29:05.831
Close the door.
Get me out of these.

29:05.874 --> 29:07.833
Come on. Get me out.

29:07.876 --> 29:09.312
Oh, come on.
Hurry up.

29:13.186 --> 29:14.665
We've delivered the formula.

29:14.709 --> 29:17.494
Just give us a moment
to back away.

29:23.500 --> 29:26.286
[beeping]

29:26.329 --> 29:28.723
[grunts]

29:28.767 --> 29:30.116
All right, come on.

29:30.159 --> 29:31.378
Okay, Deacon. Let's go.
Get them out of there.

29:32.683 --> 29:33.946
This was a mistake.

29:33.989 --> 29:35.469
Rocker, call them out.

29:35.512 --> 29:36.513
You can grab the formula now.

29:36.557 --> 29:38.167
Okay, move, move.

29:39.168 --> 29:40.343
Okay.[both grunting]

29:42.868 --> 29:44.391
Okay.

29:44.434 --> 29:46.262
Give me the baby.

29:48.221 --> 29:52.051
Got her.Come on. Come on.

29:52.094 --> 29:53.530
Okay.

29:53.574 --> 29:55.576
Take it.

29:59.014 --> 30:00.189
I thought you were watching him.

30:00.233 --> 30:01.277
Lupe told me to help you.

30:02.670 --> 30:04.367
All right, come on,
come on, come on.Okay.

30:06.413 --> 30:07.849

I'm okay.

What did you do?

30:49.935 --> 30:51.937
I'm sorry, Pablo.

30:53.329 --> 30:54.809
That's my boy.

30:54.853 --> 30:57.551
I'm sorry.You said nobody would get hurt!

30:57.594 --> 30:59.553
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

30:59.596 --> 31:02.382
Miguel, don't.

31:02.425 --> 31:04.210
HONDO:
Miguel's got a gun
pointed at Hicks.

31:04.253 --> 31:05.864
Find some way
to get in there now.

31:05.907 --> 31:07.778
Drop the platform from the Rook
and attach the battering ram.

31:07.822 --> 31:09.432
Go.

31:09.476 --> 31:11.086

the right thing.

on as a family.

35:22.468 --> 35:23.860
Yeah.

35:23.904 --> 35:26.776
You keep it at work?Yeah.

35:26.820 --> 35:28.822
Safest place in the city.
[chuckles]

35:29.997 --> 35:31.390
Dad...

35:32.826 --> 35:35.916
I heard what you said
while you were tied up.

35:35.959 --> 35:37.787
About Mom.

35:39.659 --> 35:42.618
It was nice hearing you
talk about her.

35:46.796 --> 35:48.798
It was nice talking
about her again.

35:52.454 --> 35:54.239
You know, at the very end,

35:54.282 --> 35:57.024
your mom couldn't
even recognize me.

35:58.982 --> 36:01.898
I'm not sure I'll ever feel
anything more painful than that.

36:04.074 --> 36:06.860
Wearing Deac's ring
today, the...

36:08.470 --> 36:10.429
...the weight--

36:10.472 --> 36:12.996
it was a nice reminder
of the good stuff.

36:24.834 --> 36:26.967
What are you doing?[sniffles]

36:27.010 --> 36:28.925
Something you should've done
a while ago.

36:31.406 --> 36:34.192
Come on...

36:42.025 --> 36:43.897
I like it.

36:43.940 --> 36:45.333
Thanks.

36:47.770 --> 36:49.772
[door opens, keys jingle]

36:53.036 --> 36:54.690
[door closes]

37:00.087 --> 37:02.698
Hey. Hey, turn them
damn lights off.

37:04.352 --> 37:06.267
Pop, how long you been
sitting here?

37:06.311 --> 37:08.487
I don't know.
Couple hours.

37:08.530 --> 37:09.879
With the lights off?

37:09.923 --> 37:11.533
It wasn't dark when I sat down.

37:13.405 --> 37:14.754
Your-your mom came by.

37:14.797 --> 37:16.408
Yeah, she told me
you chased her away.

37:16.451 --> 37:18.453
What's happening, man?

37:22.240 --> 37:25.678
Look, Pop,

37:25.721 --> 37:27.506
I get that it takes time
to process

37:27.549 --> 37:28.942
what's going on
with you, man, but...

37:28.985 --> 37:31.292
It didn't take any time
to process it.

37:31.336 --> 37:33.381
I processed it,
that's the problem.

37:33.425 --> 37:36.863
You know,
last few weeks,

37:36.906 --> 37:38.865
thinking it was the end,

37:38.908 --> 37:41.215
I thought I'd be scared,

37:41.259 --> 37:43.609
but I had you and Brie
right by my side.

37:43.652 --> 37:46.699
I even got
to see Winnie.

37:46.742 --> 37:49.745
It felt right.

37:49.789 --> 37:51.356
I made my peace with it.

37:51.399 --> 37:53.053
And now you got
more time left with us.

37:53.096 --> 37:54.750
More time to screw it up.

37:57.013 --> 38:00.626
I didn't do right by you.
I didn't do right by any of you,

38:00.669 --> 38:01.931
and we all know it.

38:01.975 --> 38:03.977
And I don't
deserve to have

38:04.020 --> 38:07.154
y'all rallying around me
these last few months.

38:09.765 --> 38:12.725
Made me realize
what it could've been

38:12.768 --> 38:14.553
had I been a better person.

38:14.596 --> 38:16.555
Ain't no reason you can't
still have that, Pop.

38:16.598 --> 38:18.383
Please.
The only reason

38:18.426 --> 38:20.559
that Winnie even agreed
to be in the same room with me

38:20.602 --> 38:22.125
because I was on my way out.

38:24.345 --> 38:26.608
I'm not afraid of dying, but...

38:27.957 --> 38:29.698
You're afraid of dying alone.

38:34.050 --> 38:35.617
Pop.

38:35.661 --> 38:38.751
You ain't gonna be alone.

38:38.794 --> 38:41.275
But if you really do want
to make things better,

38:41.319 --> 38:42.929
you might want to think
about mending fences

38:42.972 --> 38:44.452
and owning up to your mistakes,

38:44.496 --> 38:47.847
and I'm talking about
really owning up to them.

38:47.890 --> 38:49.327
To Mom.

38:51.372 --> 38:53.635
To Winnie.

38:53.679 --> 38:55.463
It ain't too late
to make a change.

38:57.030 --> 38:58.336
Evolve.

39:01.556 --> 39:03.341
You turned out good, Hondo.

39:04.559 --> 39:06.387
Despite my
best efforts.

39:07.475 --> 39:09.129
Credit to your mom.

39:09.172 --> 39:12.045
Yeah. She loves
reminding me of that.

39:12.088 --> 39:13.786
Hm.Let me help you.

39:13.829 --> 39:14.961
Ah, ah... H-Hey.

39:15.004 --> 39:16.789
Okay, okay.Yeah.

39:16.832 --> 39:19.008
I ain't dead yet, son.But you're small.

39:19.052 --> 39:20.488
[both laugh]

39:24.710 --> 39:26.668
Where you going, old man?

39:29.845 --> 39:32.021
Try and mend those fences.

39:42.728 --> 39:44.512
[alarm chirps]

39:51.258 --> 39:53.565
[dialing]

39:53.608 --> 39:55.654
STREET [on recording]:
Hey, you've reached Jim Street.

39:55.697 --> 39:58.396
Uh... honestly,
you're better off texting me.

39:58.439 --> 40:00.354
I mean, it's, like, almost 2020.

40:00.398 --> 40:01.964
Thanks.

40:05.577 --> 40:06.882
[dialing]

40:09.450 --> 40:10.669
Hey.

40:10.712 --> 40:13.019
Can I come over?

40:13.062 --> 40:15.064
I really, really
don't want to be alone.

40:17.502 --> 40:19.808
[doorbell rings]

40:21.984 --> 40:23.246
Hey.

40:28.556 --> 40:29.775
[door closes]

40:31.559 --> 40:32.734
Hey.

40:42.788 --> 40:44.093
Hey.

40:44.137 --> 40:45.573
[gasps]

40:45.617 --> 40:47.053
I didn't mean to spook you.
I'm sorry. My bad.

40:47.096 --> 40:48.271
[both chuckle]

40:48.315 --> 40:50.230
How'd the slam go?

40:50.273 --> 40:51.710
Uh, pretty good.

40:51.753 --> 40:53.755
17 kids.Okay. That's not bad.

40:53.799 --> 40:55.496
Sorry I wasn't able
to make it tonight,

40:55.540 --> 40:57.629
but I had to handle
some family stuff.

40:57.672 --> 41:00.501
But if you're free now,
maybe we can grab a late drink.

41:00.545 --> 41:03.373
What are you after, Hondo?

41:04.592 --> 41:07.160
I'm just trying
to get to know you.

41:07.203 --> 41:08.988
Tell me something.

41:09.031 --> 41:11.251
When was the last
relationship you had

41:11.294 --> 41:13.383
that went more than a year?

41:16.952 --> 41:18.301
Doesn't mean I don't want one.

41:19.607 --> 41:21.609
Look, my mindset
lately has been...

41:22.610 --> 41:23.742
...evolving.

41:23.785 --> 41:25.178
Evolving?

41:26.788 --> 41:29.617
My sources raise a big red flag

41:29.661 --> 41:31.445
when it comes to you
and commitment.Okay,

41:31.489 --> 41:33.839
truth be told, I really thought
you were better than that.

41:33.882 --> 41:36.189
Meaning what, exactly?Meaning you seem like

41:36.232 --> 41:39.497
the type of woman who can make
up her own mind about things.

41:44.806 --> 41:46.765
There is a bar around the corner

41:46.808 --> 41:48.636
where we can talk.

41:51.857 --> 41:53.815
You coming?

41:57.036 --> 41:58.341
Yes, ma'am.
