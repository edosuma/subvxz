WEBVTT

00:05.873 --> 00:07.441
SO THEN SPENCER SAID,

00:07.475 --> 00:09.177
"ARE YOU COMING
TO MY PARTY TONIGHT?"

00:09.210 --> 00:11.279
AND INSIDE I WAS LIKE,
"WAAH!"

00:11.312 --> 00:15.449
BUT ON THE OUTSIDE
I WAS LIKE, "SURE, WHATEVS."

00:15.483 --> 00:19.087
SO THEN I SAID,
"WHAT SHOULD I BRING?"

00:19.120 --> 00:22.090
AND HE SAID,
"JUST YOUR CUTE SELF."

00:22.123 --> 00:26.194
AND THAT TIME I DID SAY,
"WAAH!"

00:26.227 --> 00:28.196
- HI, HONEY.
- OH, HEY, MOM.

00:28.229 --> 00:29.597
HOMEWORK CALL.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.299
SORRY.
WHERE'S CHARLIE?

00:31.332 --> 00:33.134
KITCHEN, WITH GABE.

00:37.371 --> 00:41.142
CHARLIE DID IT.

00:41.175 --> 00:43.077
WHAT IN THE WORLD?

00:43.111 --> 00:46.480
WELL, CHARLIE ASKED
FOR A MILKSHAKE.

00:46.514 --> 00:49.217
LIKE A GOOD BIG BROTHER,
I DECIDED TO MAKE ONE.

00:49.250 --> 00:52.220
THEN SHE FORGOT TO PUT
THE TOP ON THE BLENDER.

00:52.253 --> 00:55.156
SO YOU PUT
YOUR BABY SISTER

00:55.189 --> 00:57.325
IN CHARGE OF
AN ELECTRICAL APPLIANCE?

00:57.358 --> 00:59.627
AND SHE LET ME DOWN.

00:59.660 --> 01:01.462
TEDDY, GET IN HERE.

01:01.495 --> 01:04.632
MOM, I'M ON THE--
WOW.

01:06.234 --> 01:08.102
GOTTA CALL YOU BACK.

01:08.136 --> 01:10.138
CARE TO EXPLAIN
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

01:10.171 --> 01:14.475
UH, A CHOCOLATE BOMB
WENT OFF?

01:14.508 --> 01:16.477
I ASKED IF WE COULD
MAKE MILKSHAKES

01:16.510 --> 01:19.613
AND TEDDY DID THIS.

01:19.647 --> 01:22.250
AND THEN
SHE STARTED TALKING
ABOUT HER PARTY AGAIN.

01:24.685 --> 01:27.255
THAT'S WHAT WE CALL
HOMEWORK SOMETIMES--

01:27.288 --> 01:31.192
A PARTY--
'CAUSE IT'S SO FUN.

01:31.225 --> 01:33.194
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S IT.

01:33.227 --> 01:35.196
NO T.V., NO COMPUTER,
NO VIDEO GAMES

01:35.229 --> 01:36.864
FOR THE REST
OF THE DAY.

01:36.897 --> 01:39.133
- I THINK THAT'S FAIR.
- AND YOU'RE WATCHING HIM.

01:39.167 --> 01:41.269
THAT'S SO UNFAIR!

01:41.302 --> 01:42.470
AND CHARLIE.

01:42.503 --> 01:44.505
MOM, I HAVE TO GET READY
FOR MY PARTY.

01:44.538 --> 01:47.208
THAT'S JUST TOO BAD.
AND WHAT DID I TELL YOU
ABOUT LYING?

01:47.241 --> 01:50.511
IT ONLY WORKS ON DAD.

01:50.544 --> 01:54.182
NOW BOTH OF YOU,
CLEAN THIS MESS UP.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.250
MY POOR LITTLE BABY.

01:56.284 --> 01:59.187
I GOTTA GIVE YOU A BATH.
MWAH.

01:59.220 --> 02:03.157
OR I COULD JUST
LICK YOU CLEAN.

02:03.191 --> 02:04.425
( rock music playing )

02:04.458 --> 02:06.260
* TODAY'S ALL BURNT TOAST

02:06.294 --> 02:07.561
* RUNNING LATE,
AND DAD SAYS *

02:07.595 --> 02:10.231
* HAS ANYBODY
SEEN MY LEFT SHOE? *

02:10.264 --> 02:12.400
* I CLOSE MY EYES,
TAKE A BITE *

02:12.433 --> 02:14.235
* GRAB A RIDE,
LAUGH OUT LOUD *

02:14.268 --> 02:16.937
* THERE IT IS
UP ON THE ROOF *

02:16.970 --> 02:20.174
* I'VE BEEN THERE,
I'VE SURVIVED *

02:20.208 --> 02:23.444
* SO JUST TAKE
MY ADVICE *

02:23.477 --> 02:25.579
* HANG IN THERE, BABY

02:25.613 --> 02:27.315
* THINGS ARE CRAZY

02:27.348 --> 02:30.284
* BUT I KNOW
YOUR FUTURE'S BRIGHT *

02:30.318 --> 02:32.186
* HANG IN THERE, BABY

02:32.220 --> 02:33.721
* THERE'S NO MAYBE

02:33.754 --> 02:36.590
* EVERYTHING
TURNS OUT ALL RIGHT *

02:36.624 --> 02:39.327
* YOUR LIFE
IS UP AND DOWN *

02:39.360 --> 02:42.463
* BUT TRUST ME,
IT COMES BACK AROUND *

02:42.496 --> 02:46.600
* YOU'RE GONNA LOVE
WHO YOU TURN OUT TO BE *

02:48.269 --> 02:50.638
* HANG IN THERE, BABY.

03:00.381 --> 03:02.583
- GOOD MORNING, DAD.
LAWN TODAY?ET TO THAT

03:02.616 --> 03:04.585
YOU KNOW, WHEN SOMEONE
SAYS "GOOD MORNING,"

03:04.618 --> 03:08.356
THE TRADITIONAL RESPONSE
IS "GOOD MORNING" BACK.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.491
SORRY.

03:10.524 --> 03:13.461
YOU GONNA GET
TO THAT LAWN TODAY?

03:13.494 --> 03:14.628
SO WHERE YOU OFF TO?

03:14.662 --> 03:16.997
I'M MEETING WITH SOME
JINGLE WRITERS,

03:17.030 --> 03:19.533
GETTING READY
FOR BOB'S BUGS BE GONE.AL

03:19.567 --> 03:22.236
A JINGLE?
THAT'S LIKE A SONG, RIGHT?

03:22.270 --> 03:24.638
THAT'S RIGHT, A CATCHY LITTLE
TUNE THAT STICKS IN YOUR HEAD

03:24.672 --> 03:26.640
AND DRIVES YOU
JUST A LITTLE BIT CRAZY.

03:26.674 --> 03:30.644
YOU KNOW EMMETT AND I
HAVE A BAND, RIGHT?

03:30.678 --> 03:33.381
YOU KNOW WE HAVE
A LAWN MOWER, RIGHT?

03:33.414 --> 03:36.517
DON'T YOU THINK
AT WRITING YOUR JINGLE?OT

03:36.550 --> 03:39.520
P.J., COME ON,
BUT I NEED A PROFESSIONAL.YOU,

03:39.553 --> 03:41.755
COME ON,
JUST GIVE US A CHANCE.

03:41.789 --> 03:44.558
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.
AT IT, KNOCK YOURSELVES OUT.T

03:44.592 --> 03:46.260
YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY.

03:46.294 --> 03:48.662
AND THEN ONE DAY
WHEN I ACCEPT MY GRAMMY

03:48.696 --> 03:51.699
FOR BEST EXTERMINATOR JINGLE,
I'M GONNA SAY,

03:51.732 --> 03:55.403
"THIS ONE'S FOR YOU, DAD.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.505
AND MY GIRLFRIEND
TAYLOR SWIFT.

03:57.538 --> 04:00.674
WHAT UP, TAY-TAY?"

04:09.550 --> 04:11.819
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

04:11.852 --> 04:14.622
NO T.V., NO COMPUTER,
NO VIDEO GAMES.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.390
I'M FREAKING OUT.

04:16.424 --> 04:18.392
WHY DON'T YOU
READ A BOOK?

04:18.426 --> 04:21.061
SURE, RIGHT AFTER
I CLEAN MY ROOM.

04:21.094 --> 04:24.298
DO YOU EVEN KNOW ME?

04:24.332 --> 04:26.734
YOU'RE A STRANGE
LITTLE DUDE.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.035
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

04:28.068 --> 04:29.603
TO THE STORE.
WE'RE OUT OF DIAPERS.

04:29.637 --> 04:31.071
PLEASE TAKE ME
WITH YOU.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.773
YOU WANNA GO SHOPPING
FOR DIAPERS?

04:32.806 --> 04:34.775
NO, BUT I WILL NOT
STAY HERE

04:34.808 --> 04:37.711
AND HAVE THESE MACHINES
MOCK ME.

04:37.745 --> 04:41.382
AGAIN, A STRANGE
LITTLE DUDE.

04:46.787 --> 04:49.723
OKAY, READ BACK
WHAT WE HAVE SO FAR.

04:49.757 --> 04:52.460
OKAY.
"JINGLE NUMBER ONE,

04:52.493 --> 04:56.063
WRITTEN BY
P.J. AND EMMETT."

04:56.096 --> 04:59.066
THAT'S IT.

04:59.099 --> 05:02.870
THINK.
GOTTA THINK.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.805
OH, HEY, MY DAD'S NAME
IS BOB.

05:04.838 --> 05:07.541
MAYBE WE SHOULD THINK OF
THINGS THAT RHYME WITH "BOB."

05:07.575 --> 05:10.578
HOW ABOUT BLOB,
GLOB AND SLOB?

05:11.779 --> 05:14.348
I'M DOING A LOAD
OF HIS WHITES.

05:14.382 --> 05:16.717
MAN, WRITING A JINGLE
IS HARDER THAN I THOUGHT.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.752
MOM, WE NEED
SOME INSPIRATION.

05:18.786 --> 05:20.621
WELL, LUCKY FOR YOU,

05:20.654 --> 05:22.690
I WROTE QUITE A BIT OF
POETRY IN HIGH SCHOOL.

05:22.723 --> 05:25.359
PUBLISHED FIVE TIMES
IN THE SCHOOL'S
LITERARY MAGAZINE--

05:25.393 --> 05:27.695
WHATEVER.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.697
ACTUALLY,
I WAS THINKING

05:29.730 --> 05:32.366
YOU COULD INSPIRE US
WITH SOME SANDWICHES.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.802
MY FIRST PIECE OR--
BACK IT UP--

05:34.835 --> 05:37.638
SHOULD I SAY
MY FIRST PUBLISHED PIECE

05:37.671 --> 05:40.874
IS CALLED SIMPLY
"LOCKER."

05:40.908 --> 05:44.378
THAT'S GREAT.
I'LL TAKE A HAM AND CHEESE--

05:44.412 --> 05:49.149
"HEY THERE, LOCKER,

05:49.182 --> 05:53.654
FILLED WITH MY BOOKS
AND PAPERS

05:53.687 --> 05:56.924
AND SECRETS.

05:56.957 --> 06:01.529
I CAN'T REMEMBER
YOUR COMBINATION.

06:01.562 --> 06:03.864
37 RIGHT,
17 LEFT,

06:03.897 --> 06:08.869
BUT THEN WHAT?

06:08.902 --> 06:11.439
AM I LOCKED OUT

06:11.472 --> 06:13.807
OR ARE YOU LOCKED IN?"

06:13.841 --> 06:15.943
( cymbals crash )

06:19.847 --> 06:22.683
SO GOOD.
SO GOOD.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.852
IT'S STILL SO GOOD.

06:24.885 --> 06:28.388
YOU WANNA DO THIS
AT MY HOUSE?

06:40.000 --> 06:42.970
WELL WELL WELL,

06:43.003 --> 06:45.906
GABRIEL B. DUNCAN.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.442
AFTERNOON, HUGO.

06:48.476 --> 06:49.810
THE MANAGER
KNOWS YOU?

06:49.843 --> 06:52.946
WE HAVE A HISTORY, YES.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.982
A WORD OF ADVICE, DUNCAN--

06:55.015 --> 06:57.751
YOU KNOCK OVER A DISPLAY
OR JOY-RIDE A SHOPPING CART,

06:57.785 --> 07:01.922
AND I WILL PERSONALLY OPEN
A CAN OF REDDI MART'S
FINEST BUTT-KICK.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.991
HEY, HAVE YOU
LOST WEIGHT?

07:04.024 --> 07:06.594
JUST KIDDING.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.997
I'M WATCHING YOU, PUNK.

07:11.865 --> 07:14.868
SODA AND MINTS?
WHAT ARE THESE FOR?

07:14.902 --> 07:16.870
I'M GONNA MAKE
A SODA GEYSER.

07:16.904 --> 07:18.205
YOU DROP A MINT
INTO THE BOTTLE

07:18.238 --> 07:20.474
AND IT MAKES THIS
HUGE EXPLOSION.

07:20.508 --> 07:22.910
WOW, THAT SOUNDS
SO COOL.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.945
PUT THEM BACK.

07:24.978 --> 07:27.848
HOW COME YOU GET
TO BUY LIP GLOSS
AND I CAN'T BUY THIS STUFF?

07:27.881 --> 07:29.817
IT'S COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT.

07:29.850 --> 07:32.920
SODA AND MINTS WON'T MAKE YOU
LOOK TOTALLY CUTE AT A PARTY.

07:35.656 --> 07:38.692
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

07:41.829 --> 07:44.932
( alarm blaring )

07:44.965 --> 07:47.735
WHAT'S GOING ON?

07:47.768 --> 07:50.270
WHY, IT'S GABE.
I MUST BE GETTING PSYCHIC.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.972
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.908
MM-HMM, COME ON.

07:54.942 --> 07:57.711
RECEIPT.

07:57.745 --> 07:59.880
THERE YOU GO.

07:59.913 --> 08:02.783
HUH, I'M SEEING
DIAPERS,

08:02.816 --> 08:05.519
BUT I'M NOT SEEING
SUNGLASSES. EXPLAIN.

08:05.553 --> 08:07.988
EXPLANATION--
WE DIDN'T GET SUNGLASSES.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.823
WELL, SOMEONE DID.

08:11.024 --> 08:14.294
( both laughing )

08:14.327 --> 08:16.029
CHARLIE DID IT.

08:16.063 --> 08:17.965
THIS TIME
SHE REALLY DID DO IT.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.800
SHE MUST HAVE GRABBED THESE
WHEN WE WEREN'T LOOKING.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.002
- THAT'S SO FUNNY.
- YOU SEE ME LAUGHING?

08:22.035 --> 08:26.674
THERE'S NOTHING FUNNY
ABOUT SHOPLIFTING.

08:26.707 --> 08:29.810
IN CASE YOU
DIDN'T NOTICE, HUGO,
WE'RE STILL IN THE STORE.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.880
UNPAID ITEMS
ARE CONSIDERED STOLEN
ONCE THEY LEAVE CHECKOUT.

08:32.913 --> 08:36.884
IN CASE YOU DIDN'T NOTICE,
WE DON'T HAVE CASH REGISTERS
IN THE PARKING LOT.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.886
TELL ALICE
TO CALL THE POLICE.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.655
THE POLICE?
YOU'RE ARRESTING A BABY?

08:41.689 --> 08:43.791
OR A VERY SMALL PERSON.

08:43.824 --> 08:45.659
WE DON'T HAVE
ALL THE FACTS YET.

09:00.674 --> 09:03.744
TURN HER
TO THE LEFT.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.879
DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S A LITTLE RIDICULOUS

09:05.913 --> 09:07.915
TO TAKE MUG SHOTS
OF A BABY?

09:07.948 --> 09:09.950
THAT'S PROCEDURE
FOR SHOPLIFTERS.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.719
TURN HER
TO THE RIGHT.

09:11.752 --> 09:15.055
OKAY, CHARLIE,
SMILE FOR HUGE-OH.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.658
STICKS AND STONES
MAY BREAK MY BONES--

09:17.691 --> 09:19.159
AGH!

09:24.965 --> 09:27.134
ARE THESE
THE SHOPLIFTERS?

09:27.167 --> 09:28.836
THAT'S RIGHT.
THE PERP IS
IN THE STROLLER.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.638
SHE'S NOT A PERP.
SHE'S A BABY.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.640
STILL UNDETERMINED.

09:32.673 --> 09:35.008
I CALLED THE POLICE,
BUT THEY SAID THIS WAS
LOW PRIORITY

09:35.042 --> 09:37.778
AND THEY WOULDN'T BE HERE
FOR THREE OR FOUR HOURS.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.647
THREE OR FOUR HOURS?

09:39.680 --> 09:41.615
ALICE, WHY CAN'T YOU
DO ANYTHING RIGHT?

09:41.649 --> 09:42.950
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.
PLEASE DON'T YELL AT ME.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.652
HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE WE BEEN OVER THIS?

09:44.685 --> 09:45.986
WHENEVER YOU TELL ME
NOT TO YELL AT YOU,

09:46.019 --> 09:48.622
IT MAKES ME WANT
TO YELL AT YOU!

09:48.656 --> 09:51.759
HI, AS ENTERTAINING AND
TWISTED AS THIS ALL IS,

09:51.792 --> 09:54.161
CAN WE PLEASE
MOVE IT ALONG?
I HAVE A PARTY TO GO TO.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.897
- YOU'RE GOING TO A PARTY?
- YES.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.666
THAT MUST BE NICE.

09:58.699 --> 10:02.703
NITWIT, DO NOT FRATERNIZE
WITH THE SUSPECTS.

10:02.736 --> 10:04.738
MIGHT AS WELL MAKE
YOURSELVES COMFORTABLE,

10:04.772 --> 10:06.740
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GONNA
BE HERE A WHILE.

10:06.774 --> 10:09.777
I'LL STAY HERE
AS LONG AS YOU WANT.

10:09.810 --> 10:12.780
- THERE'S T.V. HERE.
- THAT'S A SECURITY MONITOR.

10:12.813 --> 10:15.916
IT'S A SCREEN
AND IT'S GIVING ME PLEASURE.

10:15.949 --> 10:20.187
Woman over P.A.:
Alice, register 2
needs nickels.

10:20.220 --> 10:23.056
HUGO, I'M GONNA BRING
NICKELS TO REGISTER 2.

10:23.090 --> 10:25.826
I HEARD.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.864
GABE, WE GOTTA
GET OUT OF HERE.

10:30.898 --> 10:32.666
ARE YOU GIVING ME
PERMISSION TO BE BAD?

10:32.700 --> 10:33.734
- YES.
- HOW BAD?

10:33.767 --> 10:35.202
DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.

10:35.235 --> 10:38.739
I'VE BEEN WAITING TO HEAR
THOSE WORDS MY WHOLE LIFE.

10:38.772 --> 10:41.008
NO WHISPERING.

10:41.041 --> 10:44.011
HUGO, I HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.013
( mock laugh )
YEAH.

10:46.046 --> 10:48.849
IS THIS
SOME KIND OF TRICK?

10:48.882 --> 10:50.751
IT IS--
A MAGIC TRICK.

10:50.784 --> 10:54.054
I DRINK STUFF UP HERE
AND IT COMES OUT DOWN HERE.

10:54.087 --> 10:56.023
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

10:56.056 --> 10:58.926
AND YOU, DON'T DO
ANYTHING STUPID.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.436
LIKE THAT?

11:09.469 --> 11:11.138
"LIKE THAT?"

11:17.878 --> 11:19.747
ALL RIGHT, LET'S HEAR
WHAT YOU GOT.

11:19.780 --> 11:22.015
THIS FIRST SONG IS ONE
OF MY PERSONAL FAVORITES.

11:22.049 --> 11:24.852
IT'S CALLED
"JINGLE NUMBER ONE."

11:26.286 --> 11:29.189
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR.

11:29.222 --> 11:32.760
* BOB'S BUGS BE GONE,
BUGS BE GONE *

11:32.793 --> 11:34.261
* HE KILLS THEM
DEAD DEAD DEAD *

11:34.294 --> 11:38.932
* DEAD DEAD DEAD DEAD
DEAD DEAD! *

11:38.966 --> 11:40.868
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

11:40.901 --> 11:44.104
I THINK YOU JUST LOOSENED
ONE OF MY FILLINGS.

11:52.112 --> 11:54.748
WHERE'S HUGO?

11:54.782 --> 11:56.149
BATHROOM.

11:56.183 --> 11:57.885
OH, NO.

11:57.918 --> 12:00.153
THAT MEANS I'M IN CHARGE
FOR 30 MINUTES.

12:00.187 --> 12:04.157
( wheezing )

12:04.191 --> 12:07.861
WHERE HAVE I HEARD
THAT BEFORE?

12:07.895 --> 12:09.763
HEARD WHAT?

12:09.797 --> 12:13.066
THE... ( wheezes )

12:13.100 --> 12:14.768
IN FRENCH CLASS?

12:14.802 --> 12:16.203
OH, YEAH YEAH YEAH.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.205
YOU'RE ALICE WHEEZHEIMER.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.774
IT'S WARTHEIMER.

12:20.808 --> 12:22.109
IT IS?

12:22.142 --> 12:23.911
ARE YOU SURE?

12:23.944 --> 12:26.880
IS THAT WHAT PEOPLE
CALL ME BEHIND MY BACK--

12:26.914 --> 12:28.048
WHEEZHEIMER?

12:28.081 --> 12:30.918
NO, NOT AT ALL.

12:30.951 --> 12:32.853
NOBODY CALLS YOU
WHEEZHEIMER

12:32.886 --> 12:34.287
OR WHEEZY.

12:34.321 --> 12:39.092
HUGO CALLS ME
ALICE IN WHEEZERLAND.

12:39.126 --> 12:42.162
WHY DO YOU LET HIM
TREAT YOU SO BADLY?

12:42.195 --> 12:44.798
HE'S MY BOSS.
I HAVE TO.

12:44.832 --> 12:46.934
NO, ALICE, YOU DON'T.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.301
YOU HAVE TO
STAND UP FOR YOURSELF.

12:48.335 --> 12:50.938
IF HE YELLS AT YOU,
YOU YELL BACK.

12:50.971 --> 12:52.940
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

12:52.973 --> 12:55.809
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
I'M NOT MUCH OF A YELLER.

12:55.843 --> 12:57.878
THIS GUY IS TREATING YOU
LIKE A DOORMAT.

12:57.911 --> 13:00.113
- AND THAT'S BAD?
- YES.

13:00.147 --> 13:02.349
YOU HAVE TO STAND UP
AND SAY,

13:02.382 --> 13:05.185
"YOU CAN'T MESS WITH ME.
I'M ALICE WHEEZHEIMER!"

13:05.218 --> 13:06.954
WARTHEIMER!

13:06.987 --> 13:08.956
THAT'S THE FIRE
I'M LOOKING FOR, WHEEZY--

13:08.989 --> 13:10.123
I MEAN WARTY.

13:13.026 --> 13:15.996
HUGO, GET YOUR BUTT
IN HERE,

13:16.029 --> 13:18.131
PLEASE.

13:19.900 --> 13:23.003
( reggae tune playing )

13:23.036 --> 13:26.840
* DA BUG, MON

13:26.874 --> 13:29.242
* YEAH, DA BUG, MON

13:29.276 --> 13:32.846

13:44.925 --> 13:47.127
* FI-YI-YI-YIVE--

13:47.160 --> 13:49.162
GUYS GUYS GUYS.

13:49.196 --> 13:51.231
YOU HAVEN'T
HEARD THE SECOND VERSE.
THAT'S YOUR FAX NUMBER.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.366
IT'S A 30-SECOND
COMMERCIAL.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.603
YOU CAN'T PLACE ARTIFICIAL
LIMITS ON OUR ART.

13:56.636 --> 13:59.239
YAH, MON, DA SONG NEEDS
TO BREATHE A LITTLE.

13:59.272 --> 14:02.375
LOOK, GUYS,
I GAVE YOU A SHOT,

14:02.409 --> 14:04.144
BUT I CAN'T USE
ANY OF THESE SONGS.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.279
- WHY NOT?
- BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT--

14:06.313 --> 14:11.084
WHAT'S THE WORD?
--GOOD.

14:11.118 --> 14:13.620
P.J., COME ON.

14:13.653 --> 14:16.089
IT'S JUST BUSINESS.
IT'S NOT PERSONAL.

14:20.427 --> 14:23.130
SO I GUESS
THE POLKA NUMBER'S OUT?

14:34.041 --> 14:36.076
DID YOU JUST TELL ME
TO GET MY BUTT IN HERE?

14:36.109 --> 14:38.912
UH UH...

14:38.946 --> 14:40.447
( wheezing )

14:40.480 --> 14:42.649
YES, SHE DID.

14:42.682 --> 14:45.052
SHE'S GOT SOMETHING
TO SAY TO YOU...

14:45.085 --> 14:48.088
( wheezing )

14:49.422 --> 14:51.391
...WHICH IS

14:51.424 --> 14:53.326
SHE'S NOT YOUR
DOORMAT, OKAY?

14:53.360 --> 14:56.096
SHE DESERVES TO BE
TREATED WITH RESPECT.

14:56.129 --> 14:58.165
HOW DARE YOU
TALK TO ME THAT WAY?

14:58.198 --> 15:03.070
SHE'S GONNA TALK TO YOU
ANY WAY I WANT TO TALK
TO YOU FOR HER ABOUT.

15:03.103 --> 15:06.273
Woman over P.A.:
Price check on aisle 1,

15:06.306 --> 15:09.342
volcanic geyser
on aisle 2.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.384
THIS ENDS NOW.

15:19.119 --> 15:21.188
LET'S GO, CHARLIE.
WE'RE BUSTING OUT OF HERE.

15:28.996 --> 15:30.363
( laughing )

15:30.397 --> 15:33.533
YOU LITTLE--!

15:38.171 --> 15:41.508
COME OUT, COME OUT,
WHEREVER YOU ARE.

15:46.013 --> 15:49.349
JALAPENO-STYLE.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.294
( laughing )

16:14.074 --> 16:17.444
HUGO, CATCH ME
IF YOU CAN.

16:29.789 --> 16:33.193
GABRIEL!

16:49.509 --> 16:52.212
CLEAN UP ON AISLE...
EVERYWHERE.

16:59.086 --> 17:01.121
HEY.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.789
YOU OKAY?

17:02.822 --> 17:05.225
- DAD, CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHING?
- SURE.

17:05.258 --> 17:10.063
DO YOU THINK I SHOULD GIVE UP
MY DREAM OF BEING A MUSICIAN?

17:10.097 --> 17:11.564
WELL, I THINK
THE ONLY PERSON

17:11.598 --> 17:13.500
THAT CAN ANSWER
THAT QUESTION IS YOU.

17:13.533 --> 17:16.503
THEN THE ANSWER
IS NO.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.371
I'M NOT GIVING UP.

17:18.405 --> 17:21.174
GOOD.
THAT'S GOOD.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.510
YOU DON'T WANT
TO HAVE ANY REGRETS.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.512
- I SHOULD KNOW.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

17:25.545 --> 17:28.481
I HAD A DREAM TOO.

17:28.515 --> 17:33.086
I WAS GONNA BE
A PROFESSIONAL
WRESTLER, MAN.

17:33.120 --> 17:36.323
I WAS GONNA CALL MYSELF
"BOBZILLA."

17:36.356 --> 17:38.825
BOBZILLA?

17:38.858 --> 17:41.528
MAYBE FIVE MORE MINUTES
ON THE NAME, DAD.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.496
WELL, IT ALL
WORKED OUT FINE.

17:43.530 --> 17:47.200
I'VE GOT A NICE LIFE
AND A WONDERFUL FAMILY.

17:47.234 --> 17:49.602
BESIDES, YOU WOULDN'T WANT
TO SEE YOUR DAD ON T.V.,

17:49.636 --> 17:52.205
- BEATING UP
OTHER GUYS, WOULD YOU?
- THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.

17:52.239 --> 17:55.375
I KNOW.
SO AWESOME, RIGHT?

17:55.408 --> 17:57.377
WELL, I'M NOT GIVING UP.
IN FACT,

17:57.410 --> 18:00.480
I USED THE PAIN OF REJECTION
TO WRITE ANOTHER SONG.

18:00.513 --> 18:02.449
GOOD FOR YOU.
CAN I HEAR IT?

18:04.584 --> 18:10.190
* THE BUG MAN
CRUSHED MY DREAMS *

18:10.223 --> 18:15.262
* EVERYTHING I WANTED
TO BE *

18:15.295 --> 18:18.665
* BOB'S BUGS BE GONE

18:18.698 --> 18:22.335
* WAS THE DEATH OF ME.

18:26.539 --> 18:29.276
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:29.309 --> 18:31.311
I THINK
YOU SPEED THAT UP,

18:31.344 --> 18:33.313
HAVE A BUG SING IT
AND WE'VE GOT OUR NEW JINGLE.

18:33.346 --> 18:35.315
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
- I'M DEAD SERIOUS.

18:35.348 --> 18:36.416
YES!

18:36.449 --> 18:38.151
I DID IT!

18:38.185 --> 18:40.587
NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS FIND A SINGING BUG.

18:46.359 --> 18:48.595
( doorbell rings )

18:51.331 --> 18:53.200
ALICE.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.701
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:54.734 --> 18:57.704
I WANTED TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

18:57.737 --> 19:00.707
WHAT WAS IT?

19:00.740 --> 19:03.610
OH, I GOT FIRED.

19:03.643 --> 19:06.479
THAT'S TERRIBLE.
I'M SO SORRY.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.415
NO, IT'S WONDERFUL.

19:08.448 --> 19:12.419
THEN CONGRATULATIONS.

19:12.452 --> 19:15.622
AFTER I TURNED IN MY SMOCK,
GUESS WHAT?

19:15.655 --> 19:19.226
- I STOPPED WHEEZING.
- THAT'S GREAT.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.228
WELL, IT'S ONLY BEEN
AN HOUR

19:21.261 --> 19:24.297
AND THE POLLEN COUNT
IS LOW.

19:24.331 --> 19:28.668
WELL, LET'S KEEP
OUR FINGERS CROSSED.

19:28.701 --> 19:31.638
ANYWAY, I JUST WANTED
TO THANK YOU

19:31.671 --> 19:34.241
FOR HELPING ME STAND UP
TO HUGO.

19:34.274 --> 19:36.476
SEE YOU
IN FRENCH CLASS.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.678
HEY, ALICE,

19:38.711 --> 19:41.348
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO COME TO A PARTY?

19:41.381 --> 19:43.316
REALLY?

19:43.350 --> 19:45.985
I'VE NEVER BEEN
INVITED TO A PARTY.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.355
- NEVER?
- NOPE.

19:48.388 --> 19:50.390
I THREW ONE ONCE
FOR ARBOR DAY.

19:50.423 --> 19:52.692
NOBODY CAME.

19:52.725 --> 19:55.428
JUST ME AND A TREE.

19:55.462 --> 19:59.732
WELL, NO TREES AT THIS PARTY,
JUST LOTS OF CUTE BOYS.

19:59.766 --> 20:02.302
OH, CUTE BOYS ARE BETTER
THAN TREES.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.337
BUT YOU DO REALIZE

20:04.371 --> 20:06.539
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO TALK TO THEM, RIGHT?

20:06.573 --> 20:09.276
SURE, NO PROBLEM.

20:09.309 --> 20:12.445
( wheezing )

20:12.479 --> 20:14.581
OR I'LL TALK TO THEM
FOR YOU.

20:21.521 --> 20:24.291
Well, Charlie,
what a day.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.293
You almost got us
arrested.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.295
I had an awesome time
at Spencer's party.

20:28.328 --> 20:31.631
And we totally
trashed a store.

20:31.664 --> 20:34.301
But amazingly, Mom and Dad
never found out,

20:34.334 --> 20:37.270
so I think
we got away with it.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.406
Teddy, honey,
can I ask you a question?

20:39.439 --> 20:41.007
Sure, Mom.

20:41.040 --> 20:45.378
Why is Charlie's mug shot
all over the Reddi Mart?

20:49.349 --> 20:52.552
If I go down,
I'm taking you with me.

20:52.585 --> 20:55.288
Good luck, Charlie.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.729
And now
for the main event.
