00:14.908 --> 00:17.492
Hey, Bonnie,
how does Chinese food sound for lunch?

00:17.575 --> 00:20.617
I thought I'd surprise my boyfriend
and take him out to lunch.

00:20.700 --> 00:24.492
Last night he kind of let it slip that he
was working on Connecticut Avenue-

00:24.575 --> 00:27.533
This is the third time this week
you've taken him out to lunch.

00:27.617 --> 00:30.201
What're you trying to do?
Bribe him with Quiche Lorraine?

00:30.284 --> 00:32.785
- That isn't funny, Joan.
- It wasn't meant to be.

00:32.868 --> 00:34.618
I'll see you later.

00:59.286 --> 01:01.642
They don't take their lunch break
till 12:30.

01:01.677 --> 01:03.153
We're gonna have to wait a few minutes.

01:03.237 --> 01:07.370
You think you'll be able to crack that safe
without using a plastic explosive?

01:07.662 --> 01:10.829
With this little baby along,
it'll be a lead-pipe cinch.

01:13.038 --> 01:14.746
Just in case you can't...

01:16.580 --> 01:19.788
that should create a nice little
diversionary effort while you blow it open.

01:19.871 --> 01:23.329
I really wish we didn't have
to have all these explosives around.

01:23.413 --> 01:26.455
The odds are a million to one
against this going off by itself.

01:26.538 --> 01:28.080
Will you relax?

01:28.247 --> 01:31.664
We got a couple of minutes before
we sneak in. Let's go get a cup of coffee.

01:35.289 --> 01:38.415
Mayfield's risking an awful lot
of equipment on this job.

01:38.497 --> 01:40.622
- I wonder what he thinks he's gonna get-
- Mark!

01:41.290 --> 01:42.582
Who's that?

01:42.665 --> 01:44.915
Some broad I've been dating for a month
and trying to dump...

01:44.998 --> 01:46.707
but she's hanging on like poison ivy.

01:46.790 --> 01:48.373
Hi! How are you?

03:38.673 --> 03:41.195
What are your bosses going to say
when they find out I blew up your van?

03:41.332 --> 03:44.250
What're you talking about?
You didn't cause the van to explode!

03:44.333 --> 03:47.293
Maybe not directly, but I seem to have
this talent for disasters.

03:47.377 --> 03:50.253
I'm always right in the middle
when something terrible happens.

03:50.336 --> 03:53.212
Remember what happened when we
went boating on Chesapeake Bay?

03:53.295 --> 03:55.505
I lost my balance!
It could happen to anybody.

03:55.588 --> 03:57.005
What about that time on my couch?

03:57.089 --> 03:59.257
Look, my back went out!
I said I was sorry!

03:59.340 --> 04:02.550
The time we went skiing.
The mountain just sort of fell on us.

04:02.633 --> 04:04.925
I don't want to hear this.
I don't care about this.

04:05.008 --> 04:06.802
You guys can flap your jaws all day long...

04:06.885 --> 04:10.136
I'm getting out of here before they find out
what's inside that van!

04:17.055 --> 04:20.140
See? You see this? I'm a jinx!

04:22.225 --> 04:25.725
These pieces of French-fried machinery
were found in a gutted van...

04:25.809 --> 04:28.352
that exploded outside
J.R. Electronics today.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.728
Have the lab boys ID'd these?

04:30.812 --> 04:34.562
Yeah, this little item here
is a super-sensitive listening device...

04:34.646 --> 04:36.814
that in the right hands could be used...

04:36.897 --> 04:40.315
to crack open even the most sophisticated
combination-lock vault.

04:40.398 --> 04:42.900
- Like the one in J.R. Electronics.
- Right.

04:43.108 --> 04:44.858
But the important thing, Diana...

04:44.942 --> 04:47.692
is that that listening device
is one of several stolen...

04:47.776 --> 04:50.653
from a government research lab
about a month ago.

04:50.902 --> 04:52.820
Take a look at this.

04:53.612 --> 04:56.155
Now that's rumored to be the work
of William Mayfield.

04:56.237 --> 04:58.781
One of the best white-collar thieves
in the business.

04:58.864 --> 05:01.948
He specializes in rare items, one-of-a-kind.

05:02.032 --> 05:06.200
Like touring Inca treasures
or prototype weaponry.

05:06.283 --> 05:07.868
Things of that nature.

05:08.576 --> 05:11.119
I take it that no one's ever caught him
with the goods.

05:11.203 --> 05:12.995
No one's ever caught him, period.

05:13.078 --> 05:15.872
One of the reasons is
because he's an expert statistician.

05:15.954 --> 05:18.163
He's obsessed with the law of probability.

05:18.246 --> 05:19.498
I even heard that he has...

05:19.581 --> 05:22.874
a full-time research psychologist
that he retains year-round.

05:22.957 --> 05:26.667
You've got more gambling equipment
here, Doctor, than Atlantic City.

05:28.501 --> 05:30.336
The other way, please.

05:30.461 --> 05:33.254
One of my special fields
of interest, Mr. Reuben.

05:33.629 --> 05:37.005
I did graduate work
in probability theory at Duke University.

05:44.632 --> 05:46.967
But I've never seen anything like this.

05:47.051 --> 05:50.843
I appreciate you seeing us
on such short notice.

05:54.137 --> 05:58.306
My association with Mr. Mayfield
has been a very fruitful one for both of us.

05:58.431 --> 05:59.930
I'm glad to be of...

06:01.307 --> 06:02.682
service.

06:04.433 --> 06:05.641
Sorry.

06:06.726 --> 06:09.227
Well, that's quite all right, Ms. Murphy.

06:10.352 --> 06:14.312
Why don't we try something
a little safer, like flipping a coin?

06:24.316 --> 06:28.484
Ideally, the coin should come up
heads half the time...

06:29.151 --> 06:30.652
and tails the other.

06:30.861 --> 06:34.195
Though in practice
the ratio is closer to 60-40.

06:42.866 --> 06:46.325
But under no circumstances
is it supposed to be doing this.

06:52.244 --> 06:56.329
I've heard about a coin doing that,
I've just never actually seen it before.

06:56.704 --> 06:58.705
Take a good look, then.

06:58.788 --> 07:02.581
Because the odds are 1,000-to-1
against your seeing that again soon.

07:11.460 --> 07:14.754
Mr. Reuben, it's absolutely amazing.

07:17.046 --> 07:21.923
I've never seen anyone exert such
influence over the odds as your friend.

07:23.591 --> 07:25.716
How does she do it?

07:26.049 --> 07:29.677
One school of thought
might ascribe Bonnie's "gift"...

07:29.760 --> 07:33.928
to the same unnatural forces
that produce poltergeists.

07:34.053 --> 07:37.887
And still another
to electrochemical brain impulses.

07:38.889 --> 07:40.263
Whichever it is...

07:40.347 --> 07:44.808
she brings out the more remote
possibilities of a given situation.

07:49.434 --> 07:54.145
In Ms. Murphy's presence
all the lines of probability tend to...

07:54.770 --> 07:56.062
converge.

07:58.854 --> 08:00.356
What does that mean?

08:00.772 --> 08:02.398
Well, it means...

08:06.775 --> 08:08.192
she's a jinx.

08:09.651 --> 08:10.901
Right.

08:14.654 --> 08:17.613
- Did you get in touch with Mayfield?
- Well, sort of.

08:18.404 --> 08:22.781
- What do you mean, "sort of"?
- It's more like he got in touch with us.

08:24.783 --> 08:26.074
Hi.

08:29.451 --> 08:33.994
J.R. Electronics are developing something
big enough to warrant Mayfield's interest.

08:34.119 --> 08:36.787
Affirmative. The microwave scrambler...

08:36.870 --> 08:40.914
capable of transmitting jamming signals
across a Wide bandwidth.

08:41.456 --> 08:45.749
It is conceivable that a prototype model
could cut off all telephone...

08:45.957 --> 08:48.334
television, and radio communication...

08:48.584 --> 08:51.126
Within an area of 50 square miles.

08:51.627 --> 08:56.129
Why would a commercial electronics firm
be developing a weapon like that?

09:01.297 --> 09:04.798
The project has been
subcontracted by the Pentagon...

09:04.882 --> 09:06.883
for possible military use.

09:07.924 --> 09:10.468
I better take a look at it myself, then.

09:10.634 --> 09:13.802
If Mayfield is that hot to get it,
he may make a second try.

09:13.886 --> 09:16.971
From what you've said,
it sounds like his kind of robbery.

09:17.804 --> 09:19.221
Tell me, Ira...

09:20.097 --> 09:24.140
how do you make those computers
you tap into tell you what you want?

09:24.223 --> 09:28.976
Let's just say, Diana Prince,
that my telemetry is exceptional.

09:32.477 --> 09:33.810
Of course.

09:34.019 --> 09:36.812
Well, I know it's hard
to accept, Mr. Mayfield...

09:37.186 --> 09:40.730
but such things have been
well-documented through the centuries.

09:41.313 --> 09:44.565
Bonnie Murphy can bend
probability curves.

09:46.524 --> 09:48.066
I don't know how...

09:48.150 --> 09:49.358
or why.

09:49.818 --> 09:51.651
I just know that she does.

09:51.985 --> 09:54.319
Thank you, Doctor, thank you very much.

10:00.655 --> 10:03.573
It seems your girlfriend's a jinx after all.

10:03.865 --> 10:06.407
Well, not professionally. She just dabbles.

10:06.991 --> 10:09.117
Don't be smug, Mr. Reuben.

10:09.783 --> 10:13.911
If I did not have utter faith
in Dr. Koren's judgment, I can assure you...

10:14.995 --> 10:17.912
you'd be fertilizing the continental shelf.

10:18.537 --> 10:19.621
So...

10:20.497 --> 10:24.498
what does this have to do with recovering
$50,000 worth of stolen property?

10:24.581 --> 10:25.666
It doesn't.

10:25.749 --> 10:28.290
It replaces
$50,000 worth of stolen property.

10:28.625 --> 10:31.501
You see, Bonnie is
the perfect diversionary weapon.

10:31.793 --> 10:34.001
Whenever she becomes nervous or upset...

10:34.085 --> 10:36.044
everything around her goes haywire.

10:36.127 --> 10:38.587
You can imagine how easy it would be
to rob a building...

10:38.671 --> 10:41.922
if there was a 10-car collision outside,
or a fire or a flood.

10:43.714 --> 10:46.675
What if her amazing abilities
were to backfire on us?

10:46.840 --> 10:51.300
We keep her far enough away to be safe,
but near enough to create a diversion.

10:53.927 --> 10:55.594
All right, gentlemen.

11:20.979 --> 11:22.231
Mark...

11:22.648 --> 11:24.481
I don't understand any of this.

11:24.564 --> 11:28.192
You drag me out of work, you make me
drive all the way back here...

11:28.274 --> 11:31.318
Mark, you listening to me?
You're making me very nervous.

11:31.401 --> 11:34.402
Whatever you do, don't be nervous.
Do you understand me?

11:34.486 --> 11:35.861
Don't be nervous.

11:36.444 --> 11:40.155
You in trouble with the plumbing company
'cause I blew up your van?

11:40.238 --> 11:42.529
Bonnie, I don't work for that company.

11:42.738 --> 11:44.448
I work for the IADC.

11:45.989 --> 11:48.115
- The IADC?
- Yes.

11:48.199 --> 11:51.241
I couldn't tell you before.
National security, you know.

11:51.700 --> 11:54.076
That van was part of our operation.

11:54.160 --> 11:56.453
- And you destroyed it.
- Oh, no!

11:56.536 --> 11:59.912
That's all right now.
I'm doing everything I can to clear you.

12:00.287 --> 12:03.122
In a few minutes, we're going to meet
a few of our agents to discuss it.

12:03.205 --> 12:04.998
So, just relax.

12:20.629 --> 12:22.380
Mark, what're you waiting for?

12:22.589 --> 12:25.047
You look like you're expecting
the sky to fall in any minute.

12:25.131 --> 12:28.091
- Yeah, that'd do it.
- What?

12:28.424 --> 12:30.591
I think I spotted
some enemy agents over there.

12:30.674 --> 12:32.426
- Where?
- Don't look, smile.

12:32.634 --> 12:34.302
I'm going to go over and check it out.

12:34.385 --> 12:36.218
If anything should happen...

12:36.594 --> 12:38.720
- just don't be nervous.
- Mark!

12:38.803 --> 12:42.847
Mark, don't leave me here.
What am I supposed to do if...

13:29.615 --> 13:31.117
Come on, come on. There it is.

13:31.200 --> 13:33.200
They said the building might explode.

13:38.452 --> 13:41.121
Move along, don't panic.

13:49.165 --> 13:51.667
They told us to evacuate the building.

13:51.750 --> 13:53.959
Keep going. Get as far away as possible.

14:48.523 --> 14:50.191
Mark, where are you?

15:02.528 --> 15:05.654
- Where's your girlfriend?
- Who cares? Let's go.

15:14.951 --> 15:16.784
Mark, where are you?

15:51.924 --> 15:55.800
Apparently, Mayfield's men created
the accident on the street as a diversion.

15:55.884 --> 15:59.678
It emptied the building long enough for
them to steal the microwave scrambler.

15:59.761 --> 16:02.596
The question is now...
Will you hand me my coffee?

16:03.470 --> 16:04.554
The question is now...

16:04.637 --> 16:08.097
does Mayfield sell the device
to the black market...

16:08.180 --> 16:11.473
or does he use it to go after bigger game?
And if so, what?

16:11.599 --> 16:14.775
Ira's been working on that
and he's come up with about...

16:14.910 --> 16:18.185
a dozen possible targets
that fit Mayfield's pattern.

16:18.352 --> 16:20.144
The most likely of which...

16:20.394 --> 16:22.937
- is the Declaration of Independence.
- What?

16:23.896 --> 16:26.981
The National Archives is having
its annual housecleaning.

16:27.064 --> 16:30.190
Each year, certain documents
like the Declaration of Independence...

16:30.274 --> 16:33.024
the Constitution,
Treaty of Paris, and so on...

16:33.150 --> 16:36.568
are taken from public exhibition
and transferred to a depository...

16:36.651 --> 16:39.527
where they're checked for deterioration
and other damage.

16:40.027 --> 16:42.529
So you think that's what Mayfield's after?

16:43.571 --> 16:48.031
If he is, he's slipped a cog somewhere,
because the depository...

16:48.115 --> 16:50.907
is protected by more Marines
than were at Guadalcanal.

16:53.282 --> 16:54.992
May I help you?

16:55.367 --> 16:58.034
Yeah. I'm looking for my boyfriend.
He works here.

16:58.118 --> 17:00.369
His name is Reuben, Mark Reuben.

17:01.245 --> 17:04.121
I'm afraid that name
doesn't sound familiar at all.

17:05.539 --> 17:08.248
He's tall, dark, very good-looking.

17:08.455 --> 17:11.874
Honey, that description fits
half the agents in this building.

17:12.165 --> 17:14.291
I think they breed them for that.

17:14.376 --> 17:15.625
But Mark is special.

17:15.708 --> 17:18.417
I'm sure if you look in your files
you'll find his name.

17:18.502 --> 17:21.336
I'm sorry, miss, we just don't have
anybody by that name.

17:21.419 --> 17:23.878
But if you could give me
a little something more to go on...

17:23.963 --> 17:26.130
Okay, all right, he wears contact lenses.

17:26.214 --> 17:28.089
No, that wouldn't help.

17:28.339 --> 17:30.215
He's got a mole on his left knee.

17:30.298 --> 17:33.257
But you wouldn't know about that,
would you? I hope.

17:33.633 --> 17:34.966
Something wrong, Karen?

17:35.050 --> 17:38.426
No, Ms. Prince. This young woman
is just looking for a friend.

17:40.010 --> 17:42.844
Mark, where are you?

17:45.096 --> 17:46.805
His name is Mark, right?

17:46.888 --> 17:48.889
Yes, you know him? Mark Reuben.

17:49.139 --> 17:52.390
Well, no. But I think you and I
ought to have a little talk.

17:52.474 --> 17:55.600
Why don't you come into my office?
Give her a badge, and...

17:55.683 --> 17:57.476
You'll have to sign for it.

18:03.229 --> 18:04.770
- This way.
- Thank you.

18:21.402 --> 18:24.945
You were outside J.R. Electronics
a few hours ago, weren't you?

18:25.321 --> 18:29.448
Yeah. That's where Mark and I were
supposed to meet the other IADC agents.

18:30.031 --> 18:31.615
The other agents?

18:31.908 --> 18:34.324
Because of what I did to the van.

18:34.491 --> 18:36.075
I didn't mean anything.

18:36.159 --> 18:39.118
And Mark was going to try
and help me explain.

18:39.576 --> 18:41.703
Ms. Murphy, let's get one thing clear.

18:41.785 --> 18:44.954
I was the only IADC agent
at that building today.

18:45.954 --> 18:47.413
You and Mark.

18:48.622 --> 18:51.998
Ms. Murphy, to the best of my knowledge,
there is no agent...

18:52.123 --> 18:54.082
named Mark Reuben working here.

18:56.333 --> 19:00.002
Look, I know you people have to keep
your cover stories and all that...

19:00.085 --> 19:02.544
but I'm really getting worried about him.

19:02.961 --> 19:05.879
- He disappeared so suddenly-
- Ms. Murphy.

19:07.087 --> 19:11.965
I'm afraid that your boyfriend was lying
when he told you he worked for the IADC.

19:12.756 --> 19:14.924
It wouldn't be the first time someone...

19:15.008 --> 19:18.426
tried to impress his girlfriend
by telling her something like that.

19:18.509 --> 19:20.385
You've got your nerve.

19:20.677 --> 19:22.595
Mark would never lie to me.

19:23.178 --> 19:25.262
- I know you're upset-
- Upset?

19:25.762 --> 19:28.763
No, I'm not upset. Why should I be upset?

19:28.847 --> 19:31.765
Just because the only guy
who's ever looked sideways at me...

19:31.849 --> 19:34.181
just suddenly disappears,
and nobody will tell me where he is?

19:34.265 --> 19:36.766
And then you come along
and tell me he's lying to me!

19:36.850 --> 19:38.017
Is that it?

19:38.268 --> 19:39.976
I know you're worried...

19:40.101 --> 19:43.603
Don't patronize me, Ms. Prince.
I'm not stupid.

19:45.353 --> 19:47.896
I know Mark probably
isn't in love with me.

19:48.230 --> 19:51.439
Maybe it isn't as important to him
as it is to me.

19:51.523 --> 19:54.148
But people like me,
we take what we can get, you know?

19:54.649 --> 19:58.401
And if that means
it's someone to make dinner for...

19:58.609 --> 20:01.485
somebody to watch TV with...

20:01.569 --> 20:03.777
somebody to hold, then I'll take it.

20:03.860 --> 20:06.612
And I won't give it up without a fight!

20:08.530 --> 20:11.156
Thank you for all your help, Ms. Prince.

20:14.824 --> 20:16.367
Ms. Murphy.

20:30.497 --> 20:33.706
Karen, that little girl I took into
my office, which way did she go?

20:33.790 --> 20:36.415
She went that way like a bat out of...

20:44.253 --> 20:45.503
Bonnie!

20:56.674 --> 21:00.009
Wait a minute. You're acting
like I just returned from the dead.

21:00.093 --> 21:02.635
You may as well have.
Mark, I was so worried about you.

21:02.718 --> 21:04.678
You disappeared so suddenly.

21:04.762 --> 21:06.178
Bonnie, you have to understand.

21:06.261 --> 21:08.721
A government agent
can't always be polite.

21:14.848 --> 21:17.475
Mark, I just had
the most horrible experience.

21:17.683 --> 21:20.018
I went looking for you at the IADC.

21:20.726 --> 21:21.769
What?

21:21.852 --> 21:25.645
They wouldn't tell me anything. They
wouldn't even admit that they knew you.

21:25.728 --> 21:29.188
Ms. Prince treated me like I just fell off
a turnip truck or something.

21:29.271 --> 21:32.314
- Prince...
- Diana Prince.

21:32.397 --> 21:34.607
Diana, yes, of course, good woman.

21:35.191 --> 21:36.482
She...

21:36.858 --> 21:38.275
You have to understand, Bonnie.

21:38.358 --> 21:40.859
She couldn't be really sure
that you knew me.

21:40.942 --> 21:42.903
I figured it was something like that.

21:42.986 --> 21:46.029
Anyway, did you fix it
with your bosses about the van?

21:47.487 --> 21:49.905
Oh yeah, everything's copasetic.

21:49.988 --> 21:52.114
Good. I'm glad that's over.

21:52.198 --> 21:54.406
- I have an idea.
- What?

21:55.490 --> 21:59.284
What would you say to a nice,
quiet little drive in the country tomorrow?

21:59.783 --> 22:02.035
I know a little place down in Virginia.

22:02.118 --> 22:05.244
We can have a nice, quiet picnic
by ourselves. What do you say?

22:05.328 --> 22:07.412
Mark, that would be terrific.

22:07.621 --> 22:10.330
- Okay. I'll pick you up at around 11:00.
- Okay.

22:21.209 --> 22:24.836
I told her we were going to take a picnic
in Virginia. She'll be there if we need her.

22:24.919 --> 22:27.086
Excellent.

22:27.879 --> 22:31.797
You know, I had my doubts about your
Ms. Murphy's abilities in the beginning.

22:31.881 --> 22:35.048
But after her help in obtaining
the microwave scrambler...

22:35.132 --> 22:36.757
I must say...

22:37.049 --> 22:38.383
I'm impressed.

22:38.466 --> 22:40.884
If she can prove useful
in tomorrow's operation...

22:40.967 --> 22:44.094
then she will have more
than paid her way, so to speak.

22:44.677 --> 22:48.053
But alas, thereafter, for safety's sake...

22:48.137 --> 22:51.597
we will have to surrender her
to Neil's tender mercies.

22:54.432 --> 22:56.557
You have no objections, of course.

22:57.141 --> 22:58.516
No.

23:06.102 --> 23:07.895
Where should we meet you?

23:07.979 --> 23:12.398
Route 50, Arlington Boulevard. Just before
it intersects with the Capital Beltway.

23:12.481 --> 23:16.524
The Army truck from Sheppard Lab
will be there at about 12:25.

23:17.357 --> 23:20.942
And we shall be there at the same time
to relieve them of their cargo.

23:21.025 --> 23:22.068
Which is?

23:22.901 --> 23:25.403
Don't be impatient, Mr. Reuben.

23:25.986 --> 23:28.070
There'll be a general meeting
tonight at 8:00.

23:28.153 --> 23:32.321
The full scope and detail of my plan
will be revealed to you then.

23:36.324 --> 23:40.826
By the way, Bonnie told me
she talked to an IADC agent.

23:40.909 --> 23:43.743
Told her my name.
I don't know how much they know.

23:44.119 --> 23:45.869
What was the agent's name?

23:45.953 --> 23:47.495
Prince, Diana Prince.

23:49.912 --> 23:51.705
- You know her?
- Yes.

23:51.872 --> 23:54.748
One of their top agents.
And very formidable.

23:55.873 --> 23:58.083
We can't have her
nosing around after us, can we?

23:58.166 --> 24:00.084
You don't want me to take care of her,
do you?

24:00.167 --> 24:03.585
We will let Neil take care of it.
He's been a little restless lately.

24:03.669 --> 24:05.669
And he's more expendable.

24:07.836 --> 24:10.712
Don't press your luck.

24:11.338 --> 24:14.214
I said I was impressed, not overwhelmed.

24:44.936 --> 24:46.436
Looking for someone?

24:56.231 --> 24:57.648
Hold it.

24:58.274 --> 25:00.108
Why do you people always want to leave...

25:00.192 --> 25:02.777
just when the conversation
is getting started?

25:03.234 --> 25:05.234
Who do you work for? Mayfield?

25:07.195 --> 25:10.404
And where does he keep
his stolen goodies?

25:10.488 --> 25:12.946
He keeps the heavy stuff
under lock and key somewhere.

25:13.030 --> 25:17.114
All I've ever seen is his private
collection, in his office. It's all legal.

25:17.616 --> 25:19.657
So much for the frontal assault.

25:19.866 --> 25:21.867
What's Mayfield's current plan?

25:21.992 --> 25:24.701
We don't know yet.
We get it in bits and pieces.

25:24.784 --> 25:28.536
He's gonna steal something being shipped
from Virginia to Washington tomorrow.

25:28.619 --> 25:31.454
That's all I know. Some kind of weapon.

25:34.747 --> 25:37.248
Where does Bonnie Murphy fit into this?

25:37.373 --> 25:38.957
She's a jinx.

25:39.458 --> 25:40.958
She's a what?

25:42.375 --> 25:45.793
A jinx! Come on.
Wonder Woman must have been kidding.

25:45.960 --> 25:50.128
I know it sounds crazy, Steve,
but there are theories to prove it.

25:50.462 --> 25:54.630
Apparently this Murphy girl
attracts accidents like a magnet.

25:55.172 --> 25:57.464
Like the way that car
rammed into the propane truck...

25:57.548 --> 25:59.132
in front of J.R. Electronics...

25:59.216 --> 26:02.967
and the way that picture sort of popped off
the wall when Bonnie got upset.

26:03.050 --> 26:06.468
I suppose Mayfield's too intrigued
with the theory of probability...

26:06.552 --> 26:08.345
for us to discount the idea.

26:09.137 --> 26:12.680
What did Wonder Woman do with the guy
she got all this information from?

26:12.762 --> 26:17.306
Before she let him go, she used her lasso
to make him forget their conversation...

26:17.890 --> 26:22.100
and also to make him believe that he had
indeed killed me, as he planned.

26:22.308 --> 26:26.561
It looks like the only way to get anything
on Mayfield is to catch him red-handed.

26:26.644 --> 26:30.436
Which means letting him proceed
with this robbery tomorrow.

26:30.770 --> 26:33.729
Gentlemen, this is the depository
where, each year...

26:34.146 --> 26:38.274
certain documents are kept
while being examined for damages.

26:39.482 --> 26:43.441
The Constitution, the Declaration
of Independence...

26:44.651 --> 26:46.318
the Bill of Rights.

26:46.986 --> 26:49.152
All irreplaceable items.

26:49.236 --> 26:52.487
The place is a virtual fortress,
guarded by dozens of Marines...

26:52.570 --> 26:54.822
veritably impregnable.

26:54.988 --> 26:56.823
Under normal circumstances.

26:58.656 --> 27:01.826
This is the device
that we'll be after tomorrow.

27:02.158 --> 27:05.159
It's a prototype model
of an electrical disruptor...

27:05.243 --> 27:10.161
that can project an electromagnetic field,
capable of short-circuiting any machine...

27:10.619 --> 27:12.621
whether it's an automobile engine...

27:12.704 --> 27:15.330
or all the way to an electrical power plant.

27:17.790 --> 27:21.041
Tomorrow night,
once we have obtained this device...

27:21.333 --> 27:25.501
we shall incapacitate the main generator
of the Potomac Generating Station...

27:26.001 --> 27:29.336
thereby plunging
the entire city of Washington...

27:29.419 --> 27:31.170
into darkness, gentlemen.

27:34.838 --> 27:39.173
After that, we will use the microwave
scrambler to cut off all communication...

27:39.340 --> 27:42.008
telephones, televisions, radios...

27:42.258 --> 27:44.967
even the armed forces' walkie-talkies.

27:45.510 --> 27:47.344
The city will be paralyzed.

27:47.843 --> 27:51.512
And the Army, the National Guard,
the local enforcements...

27:51.929 --> 27:54.471
they will have their hands full, gentlemen.

27:56.972 --> 28:01.850
The blackout will effectively cut off
this depository from the rest of the world.

28:02.600 --> 28:05.934
Once we've neutralized
the Marine guards...

28:06.018 --> 28:09.227
there will be no place
where they can draw reinforcements.

28:10.353 --> 28:11.853
And, my friends...

28:12.312 --> 28:16.271
the depository, and its entire contents...

28:16.354 --> 28:20.565
of American historical documents,
will be mine.

28:21.065 --> 28:23.400
Mine for the taking.

28:23.609 --> 28:27.318
Gentlemen, tomorrow night
will become famous...

28:27.401 --> 28:30.485
or should we say infamous...

28:30.944 --> 28:34.447
as the night
the lights went out all over Washington.

28:37.030 --> 28:39.406
I made tuna-fish sandwiches.
I hope that's okay.

28:39.489 --> 28:41.199
Fine, Bonnie, fine.

28:52.245 --> 28:54.746
They're leaving now, Steve. I'm following.

28:56.080 --> 28:57.581
We got you, Di.

28:57.663 --> 29:00.874
We'll pick up their trail
right after they leave the city.

29:12.253 --> 29:13.838
Where's the truck?

29:14.254 --> 29:16.255
Leave it to the government to be late.

29:16.338 --> 29:18.589
Just relax. We're not supposed
to do anything...

29:18.672 --> 29:21.465
till Mark shows up
with Calamity Jane, anyway.

29:24.758 --> 29:27.759
This looks nice, Mark.
Why don't we stop here?

29:28.301 --> 29:31.303
Well, I know a better spot
just a little way down the road.

29:31.387 --> 29:32.803
Okay.

29:39.764 --> 29:41.515
Is something wrong?

29:47.852 --> 29:50.435
That car has been pacing us
for the last 10 minutes.

29:50.519 --> 29:52.228
Don't look around.

29:54.271 --> 29:55.813
You don't think...

29:57.063 --> 29:59.147
that it's the other side, do you?

30:00.273 --> 30:02.649
Could be, Bonnie, could be.

30:15.445 --> 30:18.114
I'm turning off now, Steve. He's all yours.

30:18.655 --> 30:20.614
Thanks, Diana.
We've got another car coming.

30:20.697 --> 30:24.157
As soon as they make their move,
we're going to close in. Let's go.

30:24.241 --> 30:25.867
Gone now.

30:27.827 --> 30:30.285
I guess we're both a little jumpy.

30:31.078 --> 30:32.286
Maybe.

30:33.870 --> 30:35.412
Caldwell, this is Trevor.

30:35.496 --> 30:38.789
We're following Reuben's car
heading west on Route 50...

30:39.122 --> 30:41.915
about a mile from the Capital Beltway.

30:47.668 --> 30:50.585
Here comes our little
bad-luck charm now. Let's go.

31:24.140 --> 31:25.308
This is Trevor.

31:25.391 --> 31:28.893
They've just picked up another tail,
must be one of their accomplices.

31:28.976 --> 31:30.810
We're going to lay back a little...

31:30.894 --> 31:33.645
give them a chance to pull off their hijack
before we move in.

32:13.161 --> 32:16.037
Mark, I think there has been
some kind of accident.

32:16.121 --> 32:17.704
Don't you touch that.

32:22.582 --> 32:23.790
All right.

32:24.749 --> 32:28.917
Now you fellows do exactly what I say
and nobody will get hurt.

32:29.334 --> 32:31.085
Now, you hit the ground.

32:31.168 --> 32:33.461
Head to toes. Hit the ground. Turn around!

32:33.545 --> 32:34.712
100 push-ups. Let's go.

32:34.795 --> 32:38.504
- Hut one, hut two, hut three-
- What are you doing?

32:38.588 --> 32:40.672
They looked stupid standing there
with their hands up-

32:40.755 --> 32:42.048
Are you out of your mind?

32:42.132 --> 32:45.091
When I was in the Army, these kind
of guys made me do push-ups...

32:45.174 --> 32:47.926
so I thought I could get back
and have them do some push-ups.

32:48.010 --> 32:50.342
Yeah, well, we're here for something else.

32:50.426 --> 32:51.677
And one...

32:51.760 --> 32:53.635
Get your push-ups going, let's go!

32:53.719 --> 32:55.053
Will you wait till I...

32:55.137 --> 32:57.638
Hut one, hut two...

33:06.183 --> 33:08.642
We heard tires screeching,
we thought we'd come down-

33:08.726 --> 33:09.852
Hold it right there.

33:09.934 --> 33:11.351
Stand behind me, Bonnie.

33:11.434 --> 33:15.020
No wonder things haven't been going well
for you lately. That's your friend Bob.

33:15.104 --> 33:17.062
Now knock off the conversation.

33:17.437 --> 33:21.564
If you keep your mouths shut,
you might just live to see another sunset.

33:21.981 --> 33:24.983
You won't get away with this.
The IADC doesn't forget traitors.

33:27.358 --> 33:29.025
Drop your weapons.

33:44.240 --> 33:46.866
Bonnie, I'm sorry I got you into this.

33:46.950 --> 33:49.325
Because now, we're both going to die...

33:49.408 --> 33:52.410
and I'll never have a chance to tell you
how much you mean to me.

33:56.954 --> 33:59.204
All right, drop the gun slowly.

34:58.270 --> 35:00.772
All right, freeze! All right, Wonder Woman.

35:02.064 --> 35:04.356
One more move, and she buys the farm.

35:04.689 --> 35:07.482
- You wouldn't shoot your own girlfriend.
- Try me.

35:07.899 --> 35:11.151
- Mark, I thought we were on the right side.
- Shut up.

35:11.568 --> 35:15.611
We are going to the truck. Neil, Bob!

35:25.364 --> 35:28.366
I'm well-aware you could catch up to us
without working up a sweat...

35:28.450 --> 35:29.867
but you do, and she dies.

35:29.950 --> 35:32.368
Not even you are fast enough
to stop that, are you?

35:48.249 --> 35:51.418
Man, it was great the way you stood up
to Wonder Woman like that...

35:51.500 --> 35:53.502
I would've lost my lunch.

35:53.668 --> 35:56.378
Nothing to it, if you've got the nerve.

36:01.504 --> 36:05.756
If this doesn't get us back on Mayfield's
good side, I don't know what will.

36:06.549 --> 36:10.926
You wouldn't think something this small
could black out an entire city. Would you?

36:11.384 --> 36:14.261
Size doesn't mean anything in electronics.

36:15.927 --> 36:17.595
What are you looking at?

36:20.263 --> 36:22.639
You never cared about me at all, did you?

36:22.722 --> 36:24.889
All you wanted to do was to use me.

36:26.598 --> 36:27.974
I trusted you.

36:28.474 --> 36:30.267
I've been dumped on so many times...

36:30.350 --> 36:33.601
I thought I'd never trust anybody again.
But I trusted you.

36:33.726 --> 36:35.894
Stop whining, will you, please?

36:35.978 --> 36:38.020
Rotten, no-good, lying...

36:55.528 --> 36:56.736
Bonnie!

36:56.820 --> 37:00.654
Will you forget about her! Let's just fix
the tire and get out of here. Let her go.

37:09.574 --> 37:13.117
Found the Army truck,
about a mile from where it was stolen.

37:13.201 --> 37:15.452
But no sign of Mark or the disruptor.

37:15.952 --> 37:19.621
You can't think of anything that might
give us a clue as to where they went?

37:19.704 --> 37:20.955
No.

37:21.037 --> 37:23.164
I've been trying to remember for hours...

37:23.246 --> 37:26.457
but all I can think of
is what Mark said before I escaped.

37:26.790 --> 37:29.625
How he did his big job tonight.

37:30.291 --> 37:32.125
He didn't say anything else.

37:32.709 --> 37:34.460
I'm sorry, Col. Trevor.

37:34.960 --> 37:36.460
Call me Steve.

37:37.169 --> 37:38.337
Steve.

37:40.630 --> 37:43.797
Tell me, how long have you
had this "talent" of yours?

37:44.172 --> 37:45.380
All my life.

37:45.464 --> 37:48.965
When I was five my parents
wanted me to enter nursery school.

37:49.799 --> 37:53.967
I cried and cried,
they finally had to force me into the car.

37:54.967 --> 37:57.719
Then on the way to school
we rear-ended a truck.

37:59.137 --> 38:01.138
Happened every day for the next week.

38:01.638 --> 38:03.305
They finally gave up.

38:03.638 --> 38:05.972
I didn't enter school till kindergarten.

38:06.056 --> 38:08.599
- Bonnie, that doesn't mean that you-
- Wait.

38:09.807 --> 38:12.142
The first time I went to a dentist...

38:12.309 --> 38:16.227
the poor guy slammed a door
on his finger and broke it in two places.

38:16.769 --> 38:19.395
My first date took me
roller skating on Long Island.

38:19.479 --> 38:22.688
I don't even want to think
about what happened to him.

38:26.023 --> 38:30.149
I guess I'm used to it now, you know.
I just expect it.

38:30.608 --> 38:34.651
There, you see? That's the trouble.
You expect bad luck so that's all you get.

38:34.735 --> 38:39.486
No. It's the odds. It's nothing I control.
I do something weird with the odds.

38:39.820 --> 38:43.155
The odds can work both ways,
good or bad.

38:43.530 --> 38:46.322
- Maybe if you felt better about your life-
- No.

38:46.990 --> 38:48.949
It's no use.

38:49.116 --> 38:50.657
I'm a jinx.

38:51.825 --> 38:53.325
Come on, Bonnie, cut it out.

38:53.409 --> 38:57.786
You're much too pretty to go through life
playing cat's-cradle with your fingers.

39:00.578 --> 39:02.954
- You mean that?
- Yes, I do.

39:03.037 --> 39:05.831
I just talked to the police.
There is still no sign of...

39:05.913 --> 39:07.623
I can come back later.

39:08.999 --> 39:11.374
It's getting late. I'll hold down the fort.

39:11.457 --> 39:13.376
Why don't you go home
before it's too dark.

39:13.459 --> 39:15.167
I think that's a good idea.

39:15.251 --> 39:16.876
Dark! That's it!

39:17.168 --> 39:18.502
- What's it?
- What?

39:18.585 --> 39:19.878
In the truck.

39:19.962 --> 39:24.171
They were moving that disruptor thing,
and Mark's friend said something about...

39:24.255 --> 39:27.006
"it's awfully small
to black out an entire city. "

39:27.339 --> 39:30.340
- Black out a city? Washington?
- He could do it.

39:30.424 --> 39:34.384
He could use the disruptor to short-circuit
the main generator on the Potomac River.

39:34.467 --> 39:38.969
That's crazy! A blackout could cause
riots and looting, hospitals shutting down.

39:39.427 --> 39:41.095
People could die.

39:41.178 --> 39:44.013
All just so Mayfield can steal
those documents?

39:44.137 --> 39:47.181
I'll get a security team
to the depository right away.

39:49.432 --> 39:51.266
Diana, maybe we ought to...

39:51.933 --> 39:53.225
Diana?

40:03.480 --> 40:05.313
Listen to me very carefully.

40:05.897 --> 40:10.315
Short circuiting an electrical generator
is not exactly like blowing out a candle.

40:11.399 --> 40:14.400
There are backup systems,
fail-safe devices...

40:14.775 --> 40:18.235
and I'm sure your associates
are putting them out, one by one.

40:19.903 --> 40:22.112
I will be waiting three blocks away.

40:22.362 --> 40:25.696
Now since this is going to cut off
all radio communication...

40:25.905 --> 40:29.240
there will be no contact
until you return with the documents.

40:30.449 --> 40:32.658
Gentlemen, good luck.

40:57.460 --> 40:58.877
End of step one.

41:35.641 --> 41:37.809
At least our emergency generators
are operating.

41:37.893 --> 41:40.895
Too bad the whole city of Washington
doesn't have one.

41:40.977 --> 41:44.437
Hello, Lou. I need a contingent
at the K Street depository...

41:44.520 --> 41:45.646
Hello?

41:46.897 --> 41:48.481
Darn. The phone's dead.

41:49.565 --> 41:51.065
I wonder.

41:53.316 --> 41:55.150
The television is out, too.

41:55.609 --> 41:58.735
Mayfield must be jamming all the
television and telephone transmissions...

41:58.818 --> 42:00.694
with the microwave scrambler.

42:00.819 --> 42:03.862
Guess I have to round up as many agents
as I can in the building.

42:03.945 --> 42:05.739
Steve, let me come with you.

42:06.113 --> 42:07.697
Bonnie, I can't let you do that.

42:07.780 --> 42:08.990
Why not?

42:09.531 --> 42:11.449
Are you afraid I'll jinx you?

42:13.074 --> 42:14.742
You win. Come on.

42:34.083 --> 42:35.875
Okay, let's hit it.

43:53.282 --> 43:55.116
If you two aren't good friends by now...

43:55.200 --> 43:57.951
you will be by the time
they get you out of this.

44:19.459 --> 44:21.877
The lights are on.
Are you responsible for that?

44:21.960 --> 44:23.086
I don't think so.

44:23.170 --> 44:25.712
Stick around, you may be
our good-luck charm.

44:32.632 --> 44:34.382
Mark, the lights.

44:34.799 --> 44:37.342
- What about them?
- They're back on.

44:37.467 --> 44:38.635
Right.

44:40.426 --> 44:44.095
Terrific. By the time I get this open,
everybody and their brother'll be here.

44:44.179 --> 44:47.846
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- What about the documents? Mayfield?

44:49.013 --> 44:51.055
Mayfield can stick
the documents up his nose.

44:51.139 --> 44:55.099
I'm not about to get caught in here
by a bunch of trigger-happy Marines.

44:56.100 --> 44:58.058
Freeze, IADC!

45:09.730 --> 45:11.939
- Wonder Woman, wait.
- Bonnie!

45:12.607 --> 45:15.774
I knew you wouldn't let
anything happen to me!

45:16.232 --> 45:18.192
No, of course not.

45:18.734 --> 45:19.943
Bonnie!

45:21.484 --> 45:23.361
I wanted to do it myself.

45:25.529 --> 45:26.945
Any sign of Mayfield?

45:27.029 --> 45:28.989
No such luck. Soon as the lights went on...

45:29.072 --> 45:30.989
he probably caught
the first plane to Brazil.

45:31.072 --> 45:34.824
Well, he might. But Mayfield isn't
an ordinary thief, he's a collector.

45:35.283 --> 45:38.450
One of his hoods told me
he has a private collection in his office.

45:50.997 --> 45:52.415
Right there.

46:07.087 --> 46:10.506
You know, you are a very unique
sort of a thief, Mr. Mayfield.

46:10.880 --> 46:13.715
I think people ought to get
a chance to see...

46:13.799 --> 46:16.299
what kind of a man
would black out an entire city...

46:16.383 --> 46:19.175
to satisfy his own personal obsession.

46:20.592 --> 46:24.927
How about if we run a tour through here
once or twice a week. Would you like that?

46:27.345 --> 46:29.972
That ought to keep you.
You'll be safe here.

46:39.183 --> 46:43.852
Steve tells me when Mark pulled his gun
on you at the depository, it didn't fire.

46:44.852 --> 46:47.853
Does this mean you are beginning
to deliver good luck?

46:48.187 --> 46:49.313
Who knows.

46:49.397 --> 46:52.856
Maybe now that I'm feeling
a little bit better about myself...

46:52.940 --> 46:55.024
maybe the odds will turn up
a little more even.

46:55.108 --> 46:56.857
Some good, some bad.

46:57.399 --> 46:59.484
That's all anyone can ask
out of life, right?

46:59.567 --> 47:01.860
I don't know about you two,
but I'm starving.

47:01.943 --> 47:04.486
Anybody interested in finding
an all-night steak house?

47:04.569 --> 47:06.987
Well, thanks but no thanks.

47:07.071 --> 47:09.820
I'm going home and sleep until noon.

47:10.614 --> 47:12.863
How about you, Bonnie?
Want to have a late dinner with me?

47:12.948 --> 47:14.657
- I would love to.
- Great!

47:14.823 --> 47:17.240
Good night, Diana.
We'll see you tomorrow.

47:17.324 --> 47:19.742
Right, Steve. Take care, Bonnie.

47:19.992 --> 47:24.077
And I've got a feeling your luck
is definitely taking a turn for the better.

47:35.248 --> 47:36.956
Keep working on it.

48:11.959 --> 48:13.139
