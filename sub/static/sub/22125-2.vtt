00:00.300 --> 00:01.750
This isn't Aldershot, is it?

00:01.800 --> 00:04.450
I can't tell you how happy that makes me.

00:05.400 --> 00:07.750
Captain Page came to say goodbye.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.950
What am I going to do without you?

00:10.300 --> 00:13.250
I think you should put some
effort into being Mrs Laithwaite.

00:13.300 --> 00:15.550
I'm just not one of the boys, Al.

00:18.900 --> 00:20.800
I'm so glad I'm married to you.

00:22.300 --> 00:23.750
What a funny thing to say.

00:23.800 --> 00:26.750
Such close relationships
we make in army life,

00:26.800 --> 00:28.750
but we pack up and we move on.

00:28.800 --> 00:32.750
Abdul Kadir Hakim -- he'll do
anything to get rid of the British.

00:32.800 --> 00:33.800
Come back, sir!

00:36.800 --> 00:39.750
I want a search party out, now!

00:39.800 --> 00:40.750
Tony...

00:40.800 --> 00:41.800
Yusra.

Aye, you just told me.

00:53.800 --> 00:57.750
You're going to go and make
yourself a cup of tea. You just...

00:57.800 --> 00:59.750
No, not for me, Dad, thanks.

00:59.800 --> 01:02.800
I'm 2,000 miles away, Dad, remember?

01:04.800 --> 01:06.800
Listen, I just called to say that, erm...

01:11.800 --> 01:14.750
It's...

01:14.800 --> 01:15.800
It's Alex, Dad.

01:17.800 --> 01:18.800
It's your son.

01:22.800 --> 01:25.800
Well, I just called to say that I'm, eh...

01:27.800 --> 01:30.300
Yep. Yeah, I remember the
old songs. Of course I do.

01:32.800 --> 01:34.750
♪ There was a soldier

01:34.800 --> 01:38.750
♪ A Scottish soldier who wandered far away

01:38.800 --> 01:40.750
♪ And soldiered far away

01:40.800 --> 01:43.750

02:05.800 --> 02:07.800
How is he?

02:09.800 --> 02:10.800
He's fine, aye.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.800
Nobody ever died of a lost memory.

02:18.800 --> 02:19.750
Are you ready for this, Dimarco?

02:19.800 --> 02:20.800
Born for it.

02:21.800 --> 02:23.750
You, Sarge?

02:23.800 --> 02:25.750
Aye. Let's go.

02:25.800 --> 02:27.750
Let's get this done.

02:27.800 --> 02:29.000
This one's for Nick Page.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.800
Where are you going?

02:48.800 --> 02:50.750
Work.

02:50.800 --> 02:51.800
Where's Mummy?

02:54.800 --> 02:57.750
She's in hospital having the baby.

02:57.800 --> 02:59.750
Yusra will look after you.

02:59.800 --> 03:02.750
Is the baby going to live here?

03:03.800 --> 03:07.800
Yes. You, me, Mummy and the baby.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.800
We can play soldiers when I get back.

03:16.800 --> 03:17.800
Promise?

03:19.800 --> 03:21.800
On parade 1800 hours, Corporal Markham.

03:23.800 --> 03:24.800
Mmm.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.750
Back to sleep.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.750
Oh, no. What time is it?

03:41.800 --> 03:43.750
Early.

03:43.800 --> 03:46.750
A good wife would have
been... would have been up

03:46.800 --> 03:49.750
and cooked her husband breakfast.

03:49.800 --> 03:52.800
You've got seven minutes.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.750
What time will you be home?

03:56.800 --> 04:01.750
I'm not sure. It's best if
you don't know too much.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.750
But you'll be home for tea?

04:03.800 --> 04:06.750
Hmm? Mmm, mm-hmm.

04:06.800 --> 04:08.750
What shall I make?

04:08.800 --> 04:10.800
Ah, you decide.

04:14.800 --> 04:15.750
It's not plugged in.

04:15.800 --> 04:17.750
Oh, it won't take too long.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.750
I have to go. Mmm.

04:19.800 --> 04:20.800
Sorry.

04:23.800 --> 04:26.750
Corporal Stoneham, he
says it is time to go.

04:40.800 --> 04:42.750
Look after him.

04:42.800 --> 04:43.800
Of course.

05:02.800 --> 05:03.650
Terribly sorry.

05:08.800 --> 05:12.750
Aden, where East meets West --

05:12.800 --> 05:14.750
vital as an oil refinery,

05:14.800 --> 05:16.200
as well as a Gulf trade route.

05:17.800 --> 05:20.750
The beach here at Aden is lovely.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.750
The sand is warm, and the sharks

05:22.800 --> 05:23.900
are not always hungry.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.750
The occasional outbreaks
of violence are caused by

05:32.800 --> 05:35.800
what are officially called
dissident tribesmen.

05:37.800 --> 05:40.800
As long as there's trouble,
there must be troops.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.750
The Queen has full
confidence in Aden's future,

05:44.800 --> 05:48.800
describing it as the perfect
example of Colonial rule.

06:04.800 --> 06:09.750
The raid party will be landing as I
speak, including Baxter and Dimarco.

06:09.800 --> 06:13.750
Their objective -- to capture one man.

06:13.800 --> 06:16.750
The target's code name is Starfish.

06:16.800 --> 06:20.750
He's brutal, he's clever...

06:20.800 --> 06:22.750
His real name is Abdul Kadir Hakim,

06:22.800 --> 06:27.750
and we believe he's responsible
for the murder of Captain Page.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.750
Now, we've received intelligence
that Starfish will be at a remote

06:29.800 --> 06:34.750
farmhouse here, which the raid
party will storm at 1300 hours.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.750
Our job is to rendezvous
upcountry with the raid party

06:36.800 --> 06:39.750
on the other side of the mountain,
where they'll be handing

06:39.800 --> 06:42.750
Starfish over to us for escort back here.

06:42.800 --> 06:45.750
We'll be in two Land
Rovers travelling in convoy.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.750
Captain Martin will command
the second Land Rover.

06:47.800 --> 06:50.800
Now, we'll have to use the
Dhala Road, I'm afraid.

06:55.800 --> 06:57.800
We've no choice about the route.

06:58.800 --> 06:59.900
Just seven miles of it.

07:00.800 --> 07:04.750
We will maintain complete radio
silence from the moment we leave

07:04.800 --> 07:07.750
this base, and it stays that way
until we return with the prisoner.

07:07.800 --> 07:10.750
This operation cannot be compromised.

07:10.800 --> 07:14.750
If one Land Rover gets into
bother, the orders are clear --

07:14.800 --> 07:17.750
the other continues to the
rendezvous at all costs, sir.

07:17.800 --> 07:19.750
(If we make it that far.)

07:19.800 --> 07:21.750
What's that, Stoneham?

07:21.800 --> 07:23.750
Nothing, sir. Sorry, sir.

07:23.800 --> 07:24.800
Good.

07:26.800 --> 07:29.750
Oh, one more thing, erm...

07:29.800 --> 07:31.750
There's a reporter coming with us,

07:31.800 --> 07:34.750
so tomorrow the world will
know what a damn good job

07:34.800 --> 07:35.750
the Royal Military Police is doing.

07:35.800 --> 07:36.750
- Sir.
- Sir.

07:36.800 --> 07:38.750
Prepare the vehicles.
Await my orders to leave.

07:38.800 --> 07:40.800
Dismissed.

07:45.800 --> 07:46.750
Sir?

07:46.800 --> 07:48.750
Orchover?

07:48.800 --> 07:50.800
Is it a girl or boy?

07:52.800 --> 07:53.750
Erm...

07:53.800 --> 07:56.750
No news yet. We don't know.

08:06.800 --> 08:09.750
I'm afraid I don't think
there's time for that.

08:09.800 --> 08:13.750
Cleanliness is next to
godliness. I make the rules here.

08:35.799 --> 08:40.750
[Left, right, left,
right, left, right, left!]

08:40.799 --> 08:43.799

09:49.800 --> 09:51.750
I like your nightie.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.750
Oh, er, it's...

09:53.800 --> 09:55.750
Frilly.

09:55.800 --> 09:56.800
Yes.

10:09.800 --> 10:12.750
Is he good at fucking?

10:12.800 --> 10:14.000
Your handsome husband.

10:15.800 --> 10:16.800
Oh...

10:17.800 --> 10:20.750
Why aren't the raid party
bringing in Starfish themselves?

10:20.800 --> 10:22.750
They're on foot.

10:22.800 --> 10:23.800
Why?

10:25.800 --> 10:26.750
It was going to be 1 Para,

10:26.800 --> 10:31.750
but the terrain makes a
parachute drop impossible,

10:31.800 --> 10:33.750
and the chopper's too noisy,

10:33.800 --> 10:35.800
so it's a speed-march in from the coast.

10:37.800 --> 10:39.000
Royal Marine Commandos?

10:40.800 --> 10:43.750
Oh. They do exist, then.

10:43.800 --> 10:46.750
It's a great honour for any
member of this regiment to serve

10:46.800 --> 10:47.750
with the SAS.

10:47.800 --> 10:50.750
Captain Page was halfway between
leaving us and joining them

10:50.800 --> 10:51.750
when he was killed.

10:51.800 --> 10:54.750
They've asked for us to do this with them.

10:54.800 --> 10:55.800
It's a tribute?

10:57.800 --> 10:58.750
Yes. That's exactly what it is.

10:58.800 --> 11:02.750
Weapons party, weapons in the hangar, now!

11:02.800 --> 11:05.750
Weapons party, weapons in the hangar, now!

11:05.800 --> 11:06.800
What?

11:37.800 --> 11:40.750
Ed, have a word. Make
sure he's ready for this.

11:40.800 --> 11:41.750
Sir.

11:41.800 --> 11:45.000
Lance Corporal Armstrong, let's
have a look at that ankle of yours.

11:47.800 --> 11:48.750
The Dhala Road, sir...

11:48.800 --> 11:50.750
Yeah, sometimes it's better to
just get on and do something

11:50.800 --> 11:53.750
and not talk about it.

11:53.800 --> 11:54.800
Sir. Sorry, sir.

11:57.800 --> 12:02.750
Everything I know about soldiering,
I've learned from Orchover.

12:02.800 --> 12:05.750
No harm in asking your
corporal for advice.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.800
OK, men, two minutes to zero hour.

12:08.800 --> 12:11.750
- Does this hurt?
- Yeah.

12:11.800 --> 12:12.750
- Here?
- Yes.

12:12.800 --> 12:15.750
- This?
- Ow!

12:15.800 --> 12:16.750
Well, you're not fit for this.

12:16.800 --> 12:19.800
You're going to have to stay
here and hold the fort with me.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.750
Er, it's not anywhere in
battle-dress regulations,

12:23.800 --> 12:27.750
but there's a convention that one
roll up from the elbow is right.

12:27.800 --> 12:30.750
It's not. It isn't enough.

12:30.800 --> 12:33.750
I go a whole roll higher -- that
takes you clear of the muscle,

12:33.800 --> 12:36.100
then the arm has maximum
freedom of movement.

12:37.800 --> 12:38.750
People laugh at me,

12:38.800 --> 12:42.750
but it can mean a quarter of
a second quicker reloading.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.750
I've seen fatal delay.

12:44.800 --> 12:46.800
I know what a quarter
of a second can mean.

12:53.800 --> 12:54.750
Load up!

13:12.800 --> 13:14.750
It's the reporter.

13:14.800 --> 13:15.900
It's the Seven Dwarves.

13:17.800 --> 13:18.800
Which Jeep am I in?

13:30.800 --> 13:32.100
Yusra, I came to thank you.

13:35.800 --> 13:36.750
I'm alone. You must go.

13:36.800 --> 13:38.750
It's dangerous for me.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.750
Look, if you don't want
me to talk to you again,

13:40.800 --> 13:41.750
just tell me now and I won't.

13:41.800 --> 13:44.800
No-one can know I helped
you escape. Promise me.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.750
How did you know it was a scorpion?

14:02.800 --> 14:05.750
Well, it's always a scorpion,

14:05.800 --> 14:07.800
unless it's a snake.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.750
Oh, I had a snake my first week here.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.750
Where was it?

14:12.800 --> 14:14.400
Oh, you have to check every time.

14:15.800 --> 14:16.750
Where?

14:16.800 --> 14:17.750
Bottom of the bed.

14:24.800 --> 14:25.900
There's a little blood.

14:26.800 --> 14:30.800
You have to push! This
baby has to be born now!

14:42.800 --> 14:44.750
That's it.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.750
There, there. There we
are. The baby's out.

14:46.800 --> 14:47.750
[It's OK.]

14:47.800 --> 14:49.750
Fetch the doctor.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.800
Where's my baby?

14:54.800 --> 14:56.750
Is it all right?

14:58.800 --> 14:59.800
Oh...

15:02.800 --> 15:04.250
This is Mary Markham's.

15:05.800 --> 15:08.750
You should be naked in bed
with your brand-new husband.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.750
There'll be a time for nighties.

15:10.800 --> 15:11.750
Where are they going today?

15:11.800 --> 15:15.750
Upcountry, which is a euphemism.

15:15.800 --> 15:18.750
Well, it's best we don't know too much.

15:18.800 --> 15:19.800
Is that what he said?

15:21.800 --> 15:24.750
In case the NLF kidnap
us, and tie us to a tree,

15:24.800 --> 15:27.750
and take away our virtue, and
force us to tell them battle plans

15:27.800 --> 15:30.750
we've been discussing with our husbands?

15:30.800 --> 15:31.800
Hmm...

15:34.800 --> 15:36.800
Do you love him?

15:38.800 --> 15:39.800
Of course.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.800
In every breath and between every breath?

15:47.800 --> 15:49.800
Yes.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.800
You must love Ed very much.

16:02.800 --> 16:03.800
Why do you say that?

16:06.800 --> 16:09.750
I don't know,

16:09.800 --> 16:11.800
just the way you talk about love.

16:40.800 --> 16:41.750
Quickly, we're coming through!

16:41.800 --> 16:43.750
Ah!

16:43.800 --> 16:44.750
Call him Peter.

16:44.800 --> 16:45.750
- Doctor?
- Yes?

16:45.800 --> 16:47.800
The baby -- Peter.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.750
My husband, Major Markham,

16:52.800 --> 16:53.750
I don't want him worrying.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.750
- Please don't tell him.
- Mmm...

17:18.800 --> 17:19.750
It's only seven miles, Stoneham.

17:19.800 --> 17:21.800
It'll be over before you know it.

17:24.800 --> 17:25.800
You sit up front.

17:33.800 --> 17:34.800
Thank you.

17:41.800 --> 17:43.750
Foot down. Straight ahead.

17:43.800 --> 17:46.000
Don't look at anything
other than the road, OK?

17:47.800 --> 17:48.800
Let's go!

18:27.800 --> 18:29.750
Contact front!

18:41.800 --> 18:42.800
First time?

18:58.800 --> 19:01.750
We're behind time. Mile and a half.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.750
We'll run in. Move!

19:03.800 --> 19:04.900
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

19:08.800 --> 19:10.750
- Are you all right?
- Yes, sir.

19:10.800 --> 19:12.800
So pick it up. Come on. Come on.

19:15.800 --> 19:18.750
- Nine hours, we calculate...
- Sir?

19:18.800 --> 19:20.750
.. that you were out there.

19:20.800 --> 19:21.800
Yes, sir.

19:23.800 --> 19:26.750
Erm... Did anyone help you in any way?

19:26.800 --> 19:27.800
No. Nobody.

19:34.800 --> 19:37.750
You stayed away from people?

19:37.800 --> 19:38.800
That's right.

19:41.800 --> 19:42.750
Good.

19:42.800 --> 19:43.750
Sir, I can't feel my foot...

19:43.800 --> 19:45.800
Oh, no, that's good. You keep it in there.

19:56.800 --> 19:58.800

20:08.800 --> 20:09.750
They're here.

20:15.800 --> 20:17.750

Who's that?

24:35.800 --> 24:37.750
Harvey Tilbrook.

24:37.800 --> 24:38.750
What does he do?

24:38.800 --> 24:40.750
He says he's a BP man.

24:40.800 --> 24:41.750
- He says?
- He's not.

24:41.800 --> 24:42.750
How do you know he's not?

24:42.800 --> 24:45.750
Oilmen never take their jackets off.

24:45.800 --> 24:47.750
So what does he really do?

24:47.800 --> 24:49.800
(He's a big fat spy.)

24:51.800 --> 24:54.750
Ah! Lassie or Elvis?

24:54.800 --> 24:56.750
Hello, Harvey. What are you talking about?

24:56.800 --> 24:59.750
With Mrs M still in hospital,
you're in charge of Christmas,

24:59.800 --> 25:04.750
and the club needs to know
the Christmas afternoon film.

25:04.800 --> 25:05.750
The Third Man.

25:14.800 --> 25:16.750
This is Joe Martin's wife.

25:16.800 --> 25:18.750
Nick Page's replacement,

25:18.800 --> 25:20.750
so actually it's you
in charge of Christmas.

25:20.800 --> 25:22.750
Your husband outranks her husband.

25:22.800 --> 25:25.750
Hmm... I hear you work for BP.

25:25.800 --> 25:28.750
My husband swears by BP.

25:28.800 --> 25:30.750
We almost ran out of
petrol once in Norfolk

25:30.800 --> 25:33.800
because he wouldn't
stop at an Esso garage.

25:36.800 --> 25:40.750
16 miles south of Cromer on the A14.

25:40.800 --> 25:43.750
Can we get a drink while you two
talk about roads in East Anglia?

25:43.800 --> 25:45.750
The usual, Clive.

25:45.800 --> 25:46.750
Certainly, ma'am.

25:46.800 --> 25:48.750
Oh, a bitter lemon.

25:48.800 --> 25:49.750
With a twist?

25:49.800 --> 25:50.750
Yes, please.

25:50.800 --> 25:53.000
You stick a double in
that and put it on my tab.

26:12.800 --> 26:15.750
I can't seem to stop shivering.

26:15.800 --> 26:19.750
You're cold because that's what
happens when you lose blood.

26:19.800 --> 26:20.800
It's not...

26:21.800 --> 26:22.750
It... It's not...

26:22.800 --> 26:24.800
Could I have a word, Doctor?

26:28.800 --> 26:30.750
Oh...

26:30.800 --> 26:31.750
- It's not stopping.
- I can see that.

26:31.800 --> 26:34.750
- Well, perhaps Colonel Amery...
- No, I can fix this.

26:34.800 --> 26:35.800
How?

26:37.800 --> 26:39.750
Get the anaesthetist. Let's get her under.

26:39.800 --> 26:41.750
- For what?
- Hysterectomy.

26:41.800 --> 26:44.600
- But Colonel Amery...
- Just get the anaesthetist, Nurse.

27:12.800 --> 27:14.800
Take up defensive positions.

27:42.300 --> 27:43.300
It's a Land Rover...

27:46.800 --> 27:48.750
.. not a Jeep.

27:53.800 --> 27:55.750
I could show you around.

27:55.800 --> 27:58.750
Sure. What?

27:58.800 --> 27:59.800
The Land Rover, it...

28:01.800 --> 28:05.750
The door comes off, so when
you're jumping in and out

28:05.800 --> 28:09.800
you don't have to bother about a
door to open and close all the time.

28:16.200 --> 28:17.300
Slow down.

28:26.800 --> 28:28.800
Relieve Orchover, Stoneham.

28:34.800 --> 28:37.750
If anything happens out
here, you're on your own.

28:37.800 --> 28:40.750
We have responsibility for each other,

28:40.800 --> 28:42.800
but not for you.

28:46.800 --> 28:49.750
Thank you.

28:49.800 --> 28:52.750
It makes a change not to be
patronised by a man in uniform,

28:52.800 --> 28:56.750
and it makes my job of reporting
on who you kill and how and why,

28:56.800 --> 28:58.750
so much easier.

29:03.800 --> 29:06.750
And now he wants to
perform a hysterectomy.

29:06.800 --> 29:07.750
Oh. Who's the doctor?

29:07.800 --> 29:09.750
- Dr Rankin.
- Hmm...

29:09.800 --> 29:12.750
It's not lack of experience in
junior doctors that kills patients,

29:12.800 --> 29:14.750
it's pride. Who is she?

29:14.800 --> 29:15.750
Her name's Mary Markham.

29:15.800 --> 29:17.750
- Oh, my God!
- You know her?

29:17.800 --> 29:20.800
- I was at Sandhurst with
Harry Markham. - Oh...

29:21.800 --> 29:22.750
We're in, sir.

29:22.800 --> 29:24.750
- For what?
- Hysterectomy.

29:24.800 --> 29:25.750
- Close her up.
- Sir?

29:25.800 --> 29:28.750
Get me six feet of rolled
bandage, soak it in iodine

29:28.800 --> 29:29.750
and fold it three times.

29:29.800 --> 29:32.750
- Sir... - A big hole in the
groin from a piece of shrapnel

29:32.800 --> 29:33.750
and it wouldn't stop bleeding,

29:33.800 --> 29:36.750
so we packed it tight
with every bandage we had.

29:36.800 --> 29:38.750
I mean, we really jammed it in.

29:40.800 --> 29:44.750
Sergeant Paul Miller in
Malaya, 2nd of June, 1957.

29:44.800 --> 29:47.750
We're going to do the same
thing with Mary Markham.

29:47.800 --> 29:49.800
What are you all looking at? Move.

30:06.800 --> 30:08.750
I'm sure it'll be fine, sir.

30:08.800 --> 30:11.800
I don't like us being in
one place for too long.

30:12.800 --> 30:13.800
I meant Mrs Markham.

30:16.300 --> 30:17.750
Right. Yes, of course.

30:27.800 --> 30:30.750
Do you want a drink with me some time?

30:30.800 --> 30:32.800
Mmm, mmm...

30:44.800 --> 30:48.800
I think the answer's yes... about Joe.

30:49.800 --> 30:51.750
In bed?

30:51.800 --> 30:52.750
Mm-hmm.

30:52.800 --> 30:53.800
Good.

30:56.800 --> 30:57.800
That's good.

30:59.800 --> 31:03.750
Of course, it means
he's had other girls --

31:03.800 --> 31:05.800
dress rehearsals for you.

31:09.800 --> 31:11.800
But you need to be the one.

31:13.800 --> 31:17.750
You need to be surprising,

31:17.800 --> 31:22.800
and unpredictable and profound.

31:34.800 --> 31:36.800
I want you to be happy.

31:47.800 --> 31:48.800
Let's swim.

32:08.800 --> 32:10.000
The bleeding's stopped.

32:14.800 --> 32:17.750
Sergeant Miller in Malaya -- did he live?

32:17.800 --> 32:19.750
The risk of infection is high.

32:19.800 --> 32:21.750
But did he live?

32:21.800 --> 32:23.100
Get her husband here now.

32:26.800 --> 32:29.750
- Understood.
- Thank you, Doctor.

32:29.800 --> 32:32.750
It's Mrs Markham, sir.
She's... It's touch and go.

32:32.800 --> 32:34.750
They've asked for the Major.

32:34.800 --> 32:35.750
Let's go.

32:35.800 --> 32:37.800
Load up!

33:47.800 --> 33:49.800
I'm sorry about Nick Page.

34:03.800 --> 34:05.750
Can you dive?

34:05.800 --> 34:06.800
No.

34:07.800 --> 34:08.800
I'll teach you.

34:12.800 --> 34:13.800
Come on.

34:14.800 --> 34:16.750
Oh, erm...

34:16.800 --> 34:18.750
All right?

34:18.800 --> 34:21.750
- Yeah. Well, what if there's
something in the...? - Arms up.

34:21.800 --> 34:23.650
- Arms up.
- Arms up.

34:24.800 --> 34:27.750
- Head down.
- Oh, no, hold on, how deep is it?

34:27.800 --> 34:28.750
It's deep enough.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.750
- Oh...
- Kick your legs out.

34:30.800 --> 34:32.000
That's all there is to it.

34:37.800 --> 34:38.750
Ah!

34:38.800 --> 34:39.800
Very good.

34:42.800 --> 34:45.750
What are you doing that for?

34:45.800 --> 34:46.750
The sharks don't like it.

34:46.800 --> 34:47.750
- Oh...
- Huh?

34:47.800 --> 34:52.750
Should have a shark net,
really, but stones seem to work.

34:52.800 --> 34:53.800
Oh, Harvey!

35:01.800 --> 35:02.800
Come on.

35:04.800 --> 35:05.800
There we go.

35:07.800 --> 35:08.800
Very graceful.

35:30.800 --> 35:33.800
Alison? Alison!

35:40.800 --> 35:42.300
Whoo!

36:09.800 --> 36:10.800
Ah...

36:15.800 --> 36:17.750
Hey! Armstrong!

36:17.800 --> 36:19.750
Stop, stop, stop!

36:25.800 --> 36:26.800
Sergeant! Sarge...

39:39.800 --> 39:41.750
- Retreat! Fire!
- Fall back!

39:41.800 --> 39:43.750
Enemy fire!

39:43.800 --> 39:46.800
Contact front. Fall back to the AOP.

39:58.800 --> 40:00.750
Sir, we should go and find them.

40:00.800 --> 40:01.800
Not our orders.

40:03.800 --> 40:05.750
What if they've got Starfish

40:05.800 --> 40:07.800
and they make it back here and we're gone?

40:17.800 --> 40:19.750
- Man down!
- Man down!

40:23.800 --> 40:25.750
- Contact rear!
- Contact rear!

40:36.800 --> 40:38.750
Dimarco, move!

40:39.800 --> 40:41.300
Right flanking!

40:44.300 --> 40:47.750
Go! Move! Move!

40:50.800 --> 40:51.800
Let's go.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.750
Re-org! Re-org on me!

40:56.800 --> 40:58.750
Re-org! Re-org!

40:58.800 --> 40:59.750
Move! Move!

40:59.800 --> 41:01.800
Ready, ready, ready!

41:04.800 --> 41:07.750
We've got to move. We've got
to move or we'll die here.

41:11.800 --> 41:12.800
Shit.

41:15.800 --> 41:17.750
Cliff! Dimarco, move!

41:17.800 --> 41:18.800
Go, go, go!

41:34.800 --> 41:36.800
Oh, God.

41:38.800 --> 41:39.750
Ready.

41:39.800 --> 41:41.800
- One at a time, go!
- Sir.

41:51.800 --> 41:54.750
Climb fast. Don't stop. Don't think.

41:54.800 --> 41:55.750
- Sir?
- Dimarco...

41:55.800 --> 41:57.750
I... Look, I don't know how to say this...

41:57.800 --> 41:58.750
What is it?

41:58.800 --> 42:00.800
I'm... I'm frightened of heights, sir.

42:08.800 --> 42:09.800
Who the hell is that?

42:12.800 --> 42:13.800
Halt!

42:16.800 --> 42:18.750
- Sir...
- Yes.

42:18.800 --> 42:21.600
It's your wife. You need to
turn around and come back now.

42:21.800 --> 42:22.750
Just don't look down.

42:22.800 --> 42:24.750
~

42:24.800 --> 42:25.900
Climb, and don't look...

42:27.700 --> 42:28.350
Sir!

42:30.800 --> 42:31.800
Shit...

42:59.800 --> 43:00.800
Captain...

43:12.800 --> 43:15.750
I can't make this decision...

43:15.800 --> 43:18.750
.. choosing between my wife and my men...

43:18.800 --> 43:19.800
I understand.

43:20.800 --> 43:22.800
You have to make it for me.

43:28.800 --> 43:30.750
We can't leave them out there.

43:30.800 --> 43:33.750
Mary Markham is being looked after.

43:33.800 --> 43:34.750
Let's go.

43:45.800 --> 43:48.750
Ugh, come on...

44:07.800 --> 44:09.750
Stop!

44:09.800 --> 44:11.750
No!

44:11.800 --> 44:12.750
Mercy!

44:44.800 --> 44:45.800
Do you believe in God?

44:49.800 --> 44:50.800
Yes.

44:53.800 --> 44:54.800
Good.

44:58.800 --> 44:59.800
Pray.

45:10.800 --> 45:16.750
Our Father, who art in heaven,

45:16.800 --> 45:18.800
hallowed be thy name.

45:23.800 --> 45:27.750
Thy kingdom come,

45:27.800 --> 45:29.750
thy will be done,

45:29.800 --> 45:32.750
on earth, as it is in heaven.

45:37.800 --> 45:42.750
Give us this day

45:42.800 --> 45:46.750
our daily bread,

45:46.800 --> 45:51.750
and forgive us our trespasses,

45:51.800 --> 45:55.800
as we forgive those who
trespass against us...

46:00.800 --> 46:05.750
.. and lead us not into temptation,

46:05.800 --> 46:10.750
but deliver us from evil,

46:10.800 --> 46:14.750
for thine is the kingdom --

46:14.800 --> 46:21.800
the power and the glory are
yours forever and ever.

46:26.800 --> 46:27.800
Amen.

46:42.800 --> 46:45.800
Sir, it's Dimarco...

46:59.800 --> 47:00.750
You can't do that.

47:00.800 --> 47:02.800
It's my job.

47:04.800 --> 47:06.750
They knew. They know.

47:06.800 --> 47:07.750
It's there for us to see.

47:07.800 --> 47:09.800
It might be an ambush.

47:11.800 --> 47:14.750
Sir, we should do something. Sir?

47:14.800 --> 47:15.750
Miss Franklin!

47:15.800 --> 47:17.800
Miss Franklin...

47:18.800 --> 47:19.800
~

47:40.800 --> 47:42.750
(Christ...) Baxter, no!

47:42.800 --> 47:45.800
Don't touch it, Sergeant
-- it may be booby-trapped.

47:52.800 --> 47:53.900
~

49:54.800 --> 49:56.750
If you were to apply
for compassionate leave,

49:56.800 --> 50:00.800
you'd probably get it, because
you'd be applying to me.

50:10.800 --> 50:12.800
He fought in the Great War, your father?

50:13.800 --> 50:15.800
He doesn't like to talk about it.

50:18.800 --> 50:20.800
Men don't.

50:27.800 --> 50:30.800
There's a photograph of him, in uniform.

50:33.800 --> 50:34.800
He looks...

50:35.800 --> 50:37.800
.. like a...

50:38.800 --> 50:40.800
.. proper soldier.

50:42.800 --> 50:43.750
Perhaps you could show it to me sometime.

50:43.800 --> 50:45.800
I don't have it any more.

50:51.800 --> 50:53.750
But...

50:53.800 --> 50:57.750
.. you could talk to him,
couldn't you? Have you ever...

50:57.800 --> 50:59.800
.. talked to him about it?

51:32.800 --> 51:35.000
- I'll drive you to the hospital, sir.
- Thank you.

51:53.800 --> 51:56.800
Your father likes your
hair combed this way.

51:58.800 --> 51:59.800
Perfect.

52:02.800 --> 52:04.750
Oh, George!

52:06.800 --> 52:08.800
Daddy's coming! Daddy!

52:13.800 --> 52:15.800
Dad! Daddy!

52:22.800 --> 52:24.750
He's going to see your new baby brother.

52:24.800 --> 52:26.800
But he promised.

52:45.800 --> 52:50.750
I've been learning Arabic,
and my dresses are here.

52:50.800 --> 52:51.750
Have you been drinking?

52:51.800 --> 52:53.750
A little. Oh, Joe, there's
a most wonderful club.

52:53.800 --> 52:54.750
Who did you go with?

52:54.800 --> 52:57.750
Alison Laithwaite. She's a friend already.

52:57.800 --> 52:59.800
- She can't be.
- What? Why?

53:01.800 --> 53:05.750
Her husband is not an easy man,
and I'm superior in rank to him.

53:05.800 --> 53:08.750
- Well, you can sort that out.
- Not if my wife is undermining me!

53:08.800 --> 53:11.750
- What do you mean? - Through her
relationship with Alison Laithwaite.

53:11.800 --> 53:14.800
- Alison doesn't care about
that kind of thing. - I do!

53:15.800 --> 53:16.800
I care.

53:23.800 --> 53:27.000
And it isn't Alison Laithwaite
who's putting her life on the line.
