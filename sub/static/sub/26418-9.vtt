WEBVTT

00:01.044 --> 00:02.959
Previously on Van Helsing...

00:03.003 --> 00:03.916
It's the shots, Jo.

00:03.960 --> 00:05.222
What?

00:05.266 --> 00:06.006
They're what's causing
these violent outbursts.

00:06.049 --> 00:07.398
It's the shots.

00:07.442 --> 00:08.965
Then we have to tell someone.

00:09.009 --> 00:09.792
No.

00:09.835 --> 00:11.315
We have to tell everyone.

00:11.359 --> 00:13.143
The names of all the people
that survived the rising.

00:13.187 --> 00:14.014
They're in here?

00:14.057 --> 00:15.058
You bet.

00:15.102 --> 00:16.190
I found her, Phil!

00:16.233 --> 00:17.234
I found your wife.

00:17.278 --> 00:18.192
She wouldn't want to see me.

00:18.235 --> 00:19.715
Not- not after what I've done.

00:19.758 --> 00:21.151
You don't know that.

00:21.195 --> 00:22.239
I forgive you.

00:22.805 --> 00:24.763
No!

00:24.807 --> 00:26.330
Phil!

00:26.374 --> 00:28.289
You think you should be heading
south in your condition?

00:28.332 --> 00:30.595
We got some room, some of you
can come with us.

00:30.639 --> 00:34.121
The sisterhood rules you now!

00:34.164 --> 00:35.992
We go to the east!

00:36.036 --> 00:38.081
We kill humans!

00:38.125 --> 00:43.434
We will rule!

00:43.478 --> 00:53.488
[snoring]

01:05.413 --> 01:06.979
[knocking]

01:07.023 --> 01:09.547
[yelling]

01:09.591 --> 01:10.374
Phil?

01:10.418 --> 01:11.810
[yelling]

01:11.854 --> 01:13.899
Phil! Phil?

01:14.639 --> 01:16.076
Phil!

01:17.425 --> 01:18.861
Phil!

01:18.904 --> 01:19.688
[yelling]

01:19.731 --> 01:21.124
Phil?

01:21.168 --> 01:22.038
[yelling]
I'm in here!

01:22.082 --> 01:22.952
Phil!

01:23.518 --> 01:24.432
Phil!

01:24.475 --> 01:26.390
I got you! I got you, Phil!

01:26.434 --> 01:30.307
[yelling]

01:30.351 --> 01:32.004
I got you! It's ok!

01:32.048 --> 01:34.224
[yelling]

01:34.268 --> 01:36.183
Hey! It's me!
It's me!

01:36.226 --> 01:37.662
It's me!

01:37.706 --> 01:38.968
I'm right here.

01:39.011 --> 01:40.056
It's ok.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.405
Hey.

01:44.191 --> 01:46.628
I'm alive.

01:46.671 --> 01:47.672
Yeah.

01:47.716 --> 01:48.978
I'm alive.

01:49.021 --> 01:50.719
Yeah, you're alive.

01:50.762 --> 01:53.113
I thought I'd be in
that darkness forever.

01:56.551 --> 02:00.207
Come on, let's get
you cleaned up.

02:05.560 --> 02:08.954
So you gonna keep trying
to off yourself?

02:08.998 --> 02:10.608
Yeah.

02:10.652 --> 02:12.741
Yeah, I'm sure there's something
out there that'll do the trick.

02:12.784 --> 02:14.177
Don't worry.

02:14.221 --> 02:16.397
You'll find it.

02:16.440 --> 02:18.660
But if you think I'm gonna keep
coming here

02:18.703 --> 02:22.142
and hosing your scrawny ass down
you've got another thing coming.

02:31.238 --> 02:35.720
Or should I just let them find
a dead man come back to life?

02:36.460 --> 02:37.505
Huh?

02:38.245 --> 02:40.116
'Cause I am telling you
right now,

02:40.160 --> 02:41.596
there are plenty of Harrisons
out there

02:41.639 --> 02:44.729
that would love to cut you up
to see how you tick.

02:44.773 --> 02:46.296
And it won't be pretty.

02:46.340 --> 02:48.255
You know that.

02:48.298 --> 02:52.781
Hell, maybe that'll kill
you, huh?

02:54.739 --> 02:59.657
It sure is a terrible thing
having people care about you.

03:04.053 --> 03:06.055
So what's next?

03:08.666 --> 03:11.103
I'm gonna find my wife.

03:22.985 --> 03:24.682
We're done here.

03:32.081 --> 03:33.909
What the...

03:48.097 --> 03:49.141
[Doc] There you go.

03:49.185 --> 03:50.142
Keep the change.

03:50.186 --> 03:52.493
Thanks so much.

03:52.536 --> 03:54.495
This coffee is actually
really good.

03:54.538 --> 03:55.757
I'm not buying it.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.193
It's- it's- I don't know what
he puts in it-

03:57.237 --> 03:57.933
Jolene Walker?

03:57.976 --> 03:58.673
Yes?

03:58.716 --> 03:59.413
You're under arrest.

03:59.456 --> 03:59.978
What?

04:00.022 --> 04:00.631
Arrested?

04:00.675 --> 04:01.284
For what?

04:01.328 --> 04:02.851
Ow.

04:02.894 --> 04:04.113
The dissemination of false
information that is detrimental

04:04.156 --> 04:05.810
to the well being of
the citizens of Denver.

04:05.854 --> 04:06.507
I didn't make that.

04:06.550 --> 04:07.464
You can't do this.

04:07.508 --> 04:09.945
You shoulda kept
your mouth shut.

04:09.988 --> 04:11.860
Jolene, just stay calm, ok?

04:11.903 --> 04:13.905
I suggest you come
along quietly.

04:13.949 --> 04:14.993
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

04:15.037 --> 04:16.560
There must be some kind
of mistake.

04:16.604 --> 04:17.866
Talk to Caitlin Bruce.

04:17.909 --> 04:19.084
Her orders.

04:19.128 --> 04:20.434
Sarah!

04:20.477 --> 04:21.826
I'm gonna fix this!

04:21.870 --> 04:22.740
Sarah!

04:22.784 --> 04:24.351
I'll find you!

04:36.624 --> 04:38.669
Beautiful country, ain't it?

04:42.456 --> 04:44.414
Huh?

04:44.458 --> 04:47.025
Beautiful out there.

04:47.069 --> 04:50.246
Minus all that horrific death
everywhere.

04:50.551 --> 04:52.379
Yeah, I guess.

04:55.033 --> 04:56.992
Worry's a good thing.

04:59.255 --> 05:00.822
How's that now?

05:00.865 --> 05:04.782
When you stop worrying
about something or someone

05:04.826 --> 05:08.003
you got nothing.

05:08.046 --> 05:10.310
Are we talking about something
in particular here,

05:10.353 --> 05:14.052
or just talking?

05:14.096 --> 05:16.838
Scarlett.

05:16.881 --> 05:20.363
You think you made
the wrong decision.

05:20.407 --> 05:22.147
That's simple to see.

05:22.191 --> 05:25.150
Is it, now?

05:25.194 --> 05:28.502
But there's no decision
that can't be undone.

05:28.545 --> 05:30.765
Yeah, well, I could do
without the psychobabble

05:30.808 --> 05:34.290
if you don't mind.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.119
Ok, suit yourself.

05:43.734 --> 05:45.519
She's better off without me
in her hair, right?

05:45.562 --> 05:48.652
She can stay focused.

05:48.696 --> 05:50.959
Stay on mission.

05:51.002 --> 05:53.788
Not have to worry about
my dumb ass.

05:53.831 --> 05:56.138
The same way you're
not worrying about her.

06:12.546 --> 06:16.811
[crying out in pain]

06:19.770 --> 06:23.383
[painful yelling]

06:23.426 --> 06:24.819
What the hell's going on
back there?

06:24.862 --> 06:26.298
It's Kit!

06:26.342 --> 06:28.823
I think her water broke!

06:30.912 --> 06:32.870
Yep, it broke.

06:34.655 --> 06:35.830
It's coming!

06:35.873 --> 06:39.050
[painful yelling]

06:39.094 --> 06:40.269
[gasping]

06:40.312 --> 06:41.662
It's gonna be ok.

06:41.705 --> 06:44.404
It's coming. It's coming.
It's coming.

06:44.447 --> 06:46.188
It's coming. It's coming.

06:46.231 --> 06:49.278
It's coming! It's coming!

06:49.321 --> 06:51.541
Thanks, Barry. I heard ya.

06:56.285 --> 06:58.896
Goddamn apocalypse.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.857
Stop!

07:02.900 --> 07:04.859
One more step and I shoot.

07:04.902 --> 07:06.208
Stand down.

07:06.251 --> 07:08.079
She's harmless.

07:08.776 --> 07:09.820
I know why you're here.

07:09.864 --> 07:10.908
Why the hell did you
arrest Jolene?

07:10.952 --> 07:12.257
I assure you she'll be given

07:12.301 --> 07:14.085
the most lenient sentence
our laws will allow.

07:14.129 --> 07:15.304
But she didn't do anything.

07:15.347 --> 07:16.740
She attempted to induce
undue panic

07:16.784 --> 07:18.220
among a fragile population.

07:18.263 --> 07:19.613
What evidence do you have?

07:19.656 --> 07:22.877
I swear, she had nothing
to do with this.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.922
She didn't make it, that's true.

07:24.966 --> 07:27.142
We already have that person
in custody.

07:27.185 --> 07:29.100
But she did spill the beans
to who did.

07:29.144 --> 07:30.841
But that's not illegal.

07:30.885 --> 07:32.800
So what the hell?

07:32.843 --> 07:35.280
You're not stupid, are you?

07:35.324 --> 07:38.153
Look, we know we can contain
the wave she's made.

07:38.196 --> 07:39.459
Then why are you punishing her?

07:39.502 --> 07:40.938
Simple.

07:40.982 --> 07:41.852
You're important and she's how
we make you cooperate.

07:41.896 --> 07:43.071
I'm not important.

07:43.114 --> 07:45.639
Ah, I wouldn't sell
yourself short.

07:45.682 --> 07:47.597
It took our best people months
to discover the link

07:47.641 --> 07:50.121
between Black Tech's repellant
and the outbreak.

07:50.165 --> 07:52.602
You did it in 48 hours.

07:52.646 --> 07:56.954
Well, maybe they're not
your best people.

07:56.998 --> 07:59.130
We want to take
this country back.

07:59.174 --> 08:00.958
Make it great again.

08:01.002 --> 08:02.525
Make it safe.

08:02.569 --> 08:04.440
Bottom line, we need you.

08:04.484 --> 08:09.619
Look, Caitlin, let her go
or I won't help you

08:09.663 --> 08:13.318
with any more of this bullshit
you think is America.

08:13.362 --> 08:15.799
Yes, you will.

08:15.843 --> 08:17.888
Try me.

08:18.889 --> 08:22.676
Jolene's fate is entirely
in your hands.

08:22.719 --> 08:25.330
You play ball, work on
eliminating the side effects

08:25.374 --> 08:28.682
to the repellant, and she
remains in a comfy cell.

08:28.725 --> 08:33.513
Succeed and voila,
early release.

08:33.556 --> 08:35.819
Defy me- ah ah,

08:35.863 --> 08:38.039
and there are much,
much worse places

08:38.082 --> 08:42.173
out there beyond these walls
she can go.

08:42.217 --> 08:43.697
Believe me.

08:45.568 --> 08:46.917
That's blackmail.

08:46.961 --> 08:48.528
I don't care.

08:48.571 --> 08:49.877
Think about it.

08:49.920 --> 08:53.837
Get back to me by the end
of the day... Sarah.

08:59.190 --> 09:00.627
[screaming]

09:00.670 --> 09:02.193
Ok. Kit, you're doing good,
you're doing good.

09:02.237 --> 09:03.673
Just keep on breathing,
in and out.

09:03.717 --> 09:04.326
In and out.

09:04.369 --> 09:05.588
Here we go.

09:05.632 --> 09:06.850
Push. Can you push?

09:06.894 --> 09:07.503
Yes, ok.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.809
Is that normal?

09:08.852 --> 09:09.984
I- how the hell am I supposed
to know, Barry?

09:10.027 --> 09:11.725
Hold on, we got you, girl.
Ok?

09:11.768 --> 09:13.291
Keep on breathing for me.

09:13.335 --> 09:14.902
[breathing deeply]

09:14.945 --> 09:16.381
One more push, one more push,
here we go.

09:16.425 --> 09:17.948
One, two, three.

09:17.992 --> 09:19.907
I can't. I can't.

09:19.950 --> 09:20.864
I can't.

09:20.908 --> 09:21.909
Don't say that.
Don't say that.

09:21.952 --> 09:22.823
You can. You have to.

09:22.866 --> 09:23.867
Give me one more, ok?

09:23.911 --> 09:27.305
One more. Here we go.
One more.

09:27.349 --> 09:29.351
[screaming of pain]

09:29.394 --> 09:30.613
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

09:30.657 --> 09:31.353
Stop pushing, stop pushing,
stop pushing.

09:31.396 --> 09:32.572
Wait, wait, what is it?

09:32.615 --> 09:33.442
What is it?

09:33.485 --> 09:34.617
Can you see the baby's head?

09:34.661 --> 09:36.619
No, it's sideways.

09:36.663 --> 09:37.620
We're gonna have to...

09:37.664 --> 09:39.579
we're gonna have
to turn it around.

09:39.622 --> 09:40.580
How the hell do we do that?

09:40.623 --> 09:41.885
I don't know, Dre.

09:41.929 --> 09:43.191
Please save my baby.

09:43.234 --> 09:45.454
Save my baby.

09:45.497 --> 09:46.455
Please, please.

09:46.498 --> 09:47.238
It's gonna be ok.

09:47.282 --> 09:48.283
It's gonna be good.

09:48.326 --> 09:49.240
It's gonna be good.
Here we go.

09:49.284 --> 09:51.286
Just gotta turn it around.

09:53.244 --> 09:55.246
[screaming of pain]

10:02.166 --> 10:07.171
[cat calling]

10:11.523 --> 10:14.222
Juan stepping in.

10:14.265 --> 10:16.920

10:23.144 --> 10:23.927

[buzzer]

10:26.408 --> 10:31.413
[cat calling continues]

11:14.325 --> 11:17.851
Enough to feed us
for an eternity.

11:17.894 --> 11:20.070
Let's take them.

11:22.333 --> 11:26.773
You speak again and I will
burn you alive.

11:31.647 --> 11:35.607
I'm sorry, sister.

11:35.651 --> 11:37.087
I just thought that-

11:37.131 --> 11:39.481
You thought what?

11:39.524 --> 11:43.180
They didn't survive
this long on stupidity.

11:53.234 --> 11:56.628
How will we reach those walls?

11:56.672 --> 11:59.066
We need an army far greater.

11:59.109 --> 12:01.372
Not greater.

12:01.416 --> 12:03.287
Smarter.

12:03.331 --> 12:05.550
These walls are meant to keep
out vampires

12:05.594 --> 12:08.640
and we are daywalkers.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.475

Jolene.

12:39.497 --> 12:41.282
[Guard] Step back from
the bars.

12:41.325 --> 12:43.458
[cat calling]

12:43.501 --> 12:45.329
Shut up down there!

12:45.373 --> 12:46.461
I'm so sorry.

12:46.504 --> 12:47.810
Oh my god, I'm so sorry.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.290
Sorry?

12:49.333 --> 12:51.379
This is not your fault.

12:51.422 --> 12:52.728
[cat calling]

12:52.772 --> 12:54.425
Hey, that's it!

12:56.863 --> 12:59.561
You know if I hadn't tested
that repellant,

12:59.604 --> 13:00.780
you wouldn't be in this mess.

13:00.823 --> 13:01.781
I should have just kept
my nose out of it.

13:01.824 --> 13:02.999
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

13:03.043 --> 13:04.566
Stop it. Stop it.

13:04.609 --> 13:07.482
It was my choice to tell
my patients

13:07.525 --> 13:11.834
and I would do it again
in a heartbeat.

13:11.878 --> 13:14.576
I'm gonna get you out of here.

13:14.619 --> 13:16.273
[Guard] Alright, time's up.
Step away.

13:16.317 --> 13:18.101
I promise you.

13:18.145 --> 13:18.798
I told you-

13:18.841 --> 13:19.537
Ready.

13:19.581 --> 13:20.495
I told you, step away!

13:20.538 --> 13:21.713
[Doc] Get off of me!

13:21.757 --> 13:23.585
Let's go. Let's go.

13:23.628 --> 13:26.501
I'll get you out of here,
Jolene.

13:26.544 --> 13:31.071
[cat calling]

13:31.114 --> 13:33.987
[crying]

13:34.030 --> 13:34.770
Hey, get off me!

13:34.814 --> 13:36.206
Get off me!

13:36.250 --> 13:41.255
[cat calling]

13:47.870 --> 13:49.567
Have you two made up yet?

13:49.611 --> 13:50.873
I take it you've made
a decision.

13:50.917 --> 13:51.961
I'll do it.

13:52.005 --> 13:52.832
That's good to hear.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.398
I'm gonna need a few things.

13:54.442 --> 13:55.269
Name it.

13:55.312 --> 13:56.748
A gene sequencer.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.359
I don't care how you get it.

13:58.402 --> 13:59.926
If you want me to do
what you want me to do

13:59.969 --> 14:01.101
I'm gonna need it.

14:01.144 --> 14:01.884
Done. Anything else?

14:01.928 --> 14:03.799
Yeah. A vampire.

14:04.756 --> 14:07.585
If you want results I'm gonna
need to get messy.

14:07.629 --> 14:08.586
I'll see what I can do.

14:08.630 --> 14:10.632
Just do it and make it quick.

14:13.591 --> 14:20.120
[whimpering]

14:20.163 --> 14:26.735
[screaming and crying]

14:26.778 --> 14:27.692
I can't.

14:27.736 --> 14:29.259
God dammit!

14:29.303 --> 14:31.392
[screaming and crying]

14:31.435 --> 14:32.436
Stop it! Stop it!

14:32.480 --> 14:33.481
Please, I can't take it.

14:33.524 --> 14:33.960
Just one more try.
One more try.

14:34.003 --> 14:35.135
Here we go.

14:35.178 --> 14:36.745
Come on.

14:36.788 --> 14:40.357
[screaming and crying]

14:40.401 --> 14:42.664
No, stop please, I can't take
it anymore!

14:42.707 --> 14:43.795
Please.

14:43.839 --> 14:45.145
[crying]

14:45.188 --> 14:46.189
You have to keep trying.

14:46.233 --> 14:50.846
You're losing too
much blood, ok?

14:50.890 --> 14:52.717
Please, you have
to save my baby.

14:52.761 --> 14:53.631
Please just do it.

14:53.675 --> 14:54.545
You know what you have to do.

14:54.589 --> 14:56.286
Please, just do it.

14:56.330 --> 14:58.114
Just do it, please.

14:58.158 --> 15:00.856
Please, Axel, please.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.727
Please.

15:04.381 --> 15:05.469
Woah, woah.

15:05.513 --> 15:06.166
Ok, ok.

15:06.209 --> 15:08.168
Do it! Do it!

15:08.211 --> 15:09.212
Do it!

15:14.174 --> 15:17.568
[muffled screaming]

15:17.612 --> 15:20.180
Hold her down, god dammit!

15:20.223 --> 15:21.311
[muffled screaming]

15:21.355 --> 15:22.747
Ok, ok, I see it!

15:22.791 --> 15:23.966
I see it! I see it!

15:24.010 --> 15:26.186
It's ok. It's ok.

15:26.229 --> 15:32.844
[screaming and crying]

15:34.063 --> 15:36.283
[baby crying]

15:36.326 --> 15:37.023
Ok.

15:37.066 --> 15:41.984
Hey. It's a girl.

15:42.028 --> 15:43.290
[baby crying]

15:43.333 --> 15:43.855
Shhhh.

15:43.899 --> 15:44.987
Oooh.

15:45.031 --> 15:46.293
It's a little girl.

15:46.336 --> 15:47.772
Your baby.

15:47.816 --> 15:48.860
Here you go, mama.

15:48.904 --> 15:49.949
Here you go.

15:50.514 --> 15:51.733
Here you go.

15:52.255 --> 15:53.691
Here you go.

15:53.735 --> 15:55.041
Yeah.

15:55.084 --> 15:56.520
Thank you.

15:56.564 --> 15:57.739
Thank you.

15:57.782 --> 15:58.870
Thank you.

15:58.914 --> 16:00.524
You did good, Kit.

16:02.265 --> 16:06.182
[weakly] Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

16:10.012 --> 16:11.057
Kit?

16:12.797 --> 16:13.885
Kit?

16:13.929 --> 16:21.676
[baby crying]

16:21.719 --> 16:26.289
[sobbing]

16:26.333 --> 16:29.249
I am so sorry. Why?

16:29.292 --> 16:30.293
[baby crying]

16:35.037 --> 16:38.388
Well, here it is.

16:38.432 --> 16:40.042
It's your gene sequencer.

16:40.086 --> 16:43.045
I trust it's to your liking.

16:43.089 --> 16:44.177
It's old.

16:44.220 --> 16:46.657
It's as you wished.

16:46.701 --> 16:49.834
It's not exactly top of the line
but we've all become accustomed

16:49.878 --> 16:52.576
to forgoing certain luxuries
these days.

16:52.620 --> 16:53.925
And my vampire?

16:53.969 --> 16:55.623
It's en route as we speak.

16:59.279 --> 17:01.629
We've installed a reinforced
cell over there.

17:01.672 --> 17:05.154
That I can assure you
is top of the line.

17:05.198 --> 17:06.416
And this?

17:06.460 --> 17:07.809
Aluminium solicite.

17:07.852 --> 17:10.029
It's the base compound
for our repellant.

17:10.072 --> 17:13.075
Or psychotic break inducer
I think you mean.

17:13.119 --> 17:16.035
Jolene's hoping
you'll change that.

17:26.523 --> 17:28.308
How'd you get all this
so quickly?

17:28.351 --> 17:30.310
Let's just say Black Tech's
influence reaches

17:30.353 --> 17:33.008
far beyond the walls of Denver.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.879
Now get to work.

17:43.845 --> 17:45.499
Ok.

17:55.639 --> 18:01.123
Oh man, here goes everything.

18:33.373 --> 18:34.069
Hey.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.114
Hey, Frankie.

18:35.157 --> 18:36.550
Hi.

18:36.593 --> 18:38.639
I'd say no one pissed in
your corn flakes this morning.

18:38.682 --> 18:45.298
Wait, why- why would someone
piss in my corn flakes?

18:45.341 --> 18:48.170
Are you serious?

18:48.214 --> 18:49.519
No.

18:49.563 --> 18:50.912
No, I'm just kidding.

18:50.955 --> 18:53.741
Just kidding.

18:53.784 --> 18:55.351
What's got you so chipper?

18:55.395 --> 19:01.314
Well, I feel about as good
as you look.

19:01.357 --> 19:02.576
If I didn't know any better

19:02.619 --> 19:05.622
I'd say you're trying to hit
on your boss.

19:05.666 --> 19:08.408
Maybe I am.

19:08.451 --> 19:11.454
Will you allow me
to take you out?

19:13.717 --> 19:15.502
I'll allow it, yes.

19:17.721 --> 19:19.897
Great, great. Great!

19:19.941 --> 19:23.249
Uh, how about dinner, tonight?

19:23.292 --> 19:24.815
How about now?

19:24.859 --> 19:27.166
What about the bar?

19:27.209 --> 19:29.342
It's fine.

19:29.385 --> 19:31.344
I know the owner.

19:38.481 --> 19:40.135
[crash]

19:41.919 --> 19:43.182
Oh, the door.

19:48.535 --> 19:52.408
So dinner's off?

19:52.452 --> 19:54.976
I prefer breakfast, anyway.

19:59.110 --> 19:59.981
Hey there.

20:00.024 --> 20:01.504
How can I help you today?

20:01.548 --> 20:02.810
I'm trying to find my wife.

20:02.853 --> 20:05.073
Oh, exciting.

20:05.116 --> 20:09.033
Lovers separated by tragedy
attempting to reunite.

20:09.077 --> 20:10.774
Something like that.

20:10.818 --> 20:12.036
Yeah. Name?

20:12.080 --> 20:12.733
Fleischman.

20:12.776 --> 20:14.213
Jennifer Fleischman.

20:14.256 --> 20:17.128
She may be using her
maiden name, Houser.

20:17.172 --> 20:19.740
The plot thickens.

20:19.783 --> 20:23.004
Do you suspect that
she thinks you're dead

20:23.047 --> 20:28.096
and reverted to her maiden name
in hopes to take another?

20:28.139 --> 20:30.751
Been reading too much
Danielle Steele?

20:35.886 --> 20:40.456
Come back in four to six days.

20:40.500 --> 20:41.457
Four to six days?

20:41.501 --> 20:44.155
That's right.

20:44.199 --> 20:44.982
Well, which is it?

20:45.026 --> 20:46.288
Four or six?

20:46.332 --> 20:47.289
You're funny.

20:47.333 --> 20:50.553
You like making jokes.

20:52.338 --> 20:55.297
I'm not leaving here
'til I find my wife.

20:55.341 --> 21:00.128
Then get comfortable, because
it's gonna be four to six days.

21:06.743 --> 21:10.181
I want you to listen to me
very carefully.

21:10.225 --> 21:13.272
You see, if I have four to
six days to plot your death

21:13.315 --> 21:15.839
no one will ever find your body.

21:15.883 --> 21:18.712
You'll just be that guy
who didn't show up for work

21:18.755 --> 21:20.801
and I'll be back here
in four to six days

21:20.844 --> 21:24.674
and your replacement will
tell me what I need to know.

21:29.113 --> 21:30.550
Give me a moment.

21:31.377 --> 21:33.204
Thank you.

21:38.688 --> 21:39.602
Julius!

21:40.299 --> 21:41.822
Julius!

21:42.518 --> 21:44.607
Phil, Phil.

21:44.651 --> 21:45.347
What're you doing here?

21:45.391 --> 21:46.609
Is everything alright?

21:46.653 --> 21:49.482
I found her. I found Jennifer.

21:49.525 --> 21:50.918
That's great.

21:50.961 --> 21:52.398
But- but why are you here?

21:52.441 --> 21:53.355
Well, she's not here.

21:53.399 --> 21:54.878
She's not in Denver.

21:54.922 --> 21:58.491
They transferred her to some
place called the Loveland.

21:58.534 --> 22:00.449
Loveland?

22:00.493 --> 22:01.494
Oh, hey Frankie.

22:01.537 --> 22:03.626
Yeah, you know it?

22:03.670 --> 22:06.455
Loveland's the prison colony.

22:06.499 --> 22:07.848
Prison?

22:07.891 --> 22:11.547
What- there must be
some mistake.

22:11.591 --> 22:13.375
I'm sorry, Phil.

22:13.419 --> 22:14.985
No, I mean, that doesn't
make any sense.

22:15.029 --> 22:16.770
I- I gotta go there.

22:16.813 --> 22:17.814
You can't.

22:17.858 --> 22:19.076
What do you mean?

22:19.120 --> 22:22.863
No one goes there
and no one comes back.

22:22.906 --> 22:24.647
I'm so sorry.

22:28.738 --> 22:30.174
I gotta get there.

22:31.828 --> 22:33.047
Phil.

22:36.442 --> 22:38.008
I'm- I'm sorry.

22:38.052 --> 22:40.620
I gotta go after him,
make sure he's alright.

22:40.663 --> 22:42.012
I'm sorry.

23:02.163 --> 23:03.425
You sure about this?

23:03.469 --> 23:04.774
Going it alone out there?

23:04.818 --> 23:06.646
Yeah, I'm positive.

23:06.689 --> 23:07.560
Alright.

23:07.603 --> 23:08.604
You'll find her.

23:08.648 --> 23:10.258
I have faith.

23:10.301 --> 23:13.870
Love is a beacon of light that
guides us where we need to be.

23:13.914 --> 23:15.437
I sure hope you're right.

23:15.481 --> 23:17.004
Me too.

23:17.047 --> 23:19.615
Thanks for getting us
here alive.

23:19.659 --> 23:20.486
You got it, brother.

23:20.529 --> 23:21.661
I could come with you.

23:21.704 --> 23:23.140
Oh, come on, Barry.

23:23.184 --> 23:26.274
You've done enough burying
for a while, haven't you?

23:26.317 --> 23:29.451
Besides, you've got your hands
full there, don't you?

23:29.495 --> 23:30.539
Right.

23:30.583 --> 23:33.107
You name her yet?

23:33.150 --> 23:34.848
I get to name her?

23:34.891 --> 23:36.415
Somebody's got to.

23:39.287 --> 23:40.984
Kit.

23:41.028 --> 23:43.552
How about Kit?

23:43.596 --> 23:44.771
I love that.

23:44.814 --> 23:45.946
Solid choice, Barry.

23:45.989 --> 23:48.644
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

23:48.688 --> 23:50.385
You make sure you tell whoever's
in charge here

23:50.429 --> 23:52.300
about those daywalkers, alright?

23:52.343 --> 23:53.519
We will.

23:53.562 --> 23:55.521
Come here.
Thank you.

23:59.046 --> 24:01.309
Been a pleasure.

24:01.352 --> 24:02.353
Come on, crew.

24:02.397 --> 24:04.617
Let's go.

24:07.315 --> 24:10.318
Come on, Kit, we got
a new home.

24:10.361 --> 24:11.537
[Dre] See you on
the greasy side.

24:11.580 --> 24:12.625
[MaryBeth] Come on, let's go,
people.

24:21.590 --> 24:23.679
Going to break that...

25:02.326 --> 25:04.851
We should take them now.

25:04.894 --> 25:06.853
Our numbers grow hungry.

25:06.896 --> 25:08.115
No.

25:08.158 --> 25:10.857
We'll have more than enough
to eat later.

25:17.167 --> 25:19.039
Give me your clothes.

25:30.485 --> 25:32.400
Come on, let's stay close.

25:32.443 --> 25:34.489
We don't know what
we're looking at.

25:34.533 --> 25:37.536
[Announcement] You are now
entering a secured area.

25:37.579 --> 25:39.755
Prepare to present
identification

25:39.799 --> 25:41.757
and surrender all weapons.

25:41.801 --> 25:42.802
This is it.

25:42.845 --> 25:44.543
Holy shit.

25:44.586 --> 25:46.283
Yeah, you're not kidding.

25:46.327 --> 25:48.590
I repeat, you are now entering
a secured area.

25:48.634 --> 25:51.637
These UV lights
must keep them out.

25:51.680 --> 25:54.161
These aren't going to work
against the daywalkers.

25:54.204 --> 25:56.206
That's for sure.

25:58.208 --> 26:01.255
You are now entering
a secured area.

26:01.298 --> 26:03.823
Prepare to present
identification

26:03.866 --> 26:06.347
and surrender all weapons.

26:06.390 --> 26:11.395
[fighting grunts]

26:16.531 --> 26:17.924
Damn it!

26:18.707 --> 26:22.102
[fighting grunts]

26:36.986 --> 26:37.987
Shit.

26:47.910 --> 26:49.346
Shut up!

26:51.174 --> 26:52.654
Fine.

27:00.357 --> 27:01.141
Hi.

27:01.184 --> 27:02.403
On, you're awake.

27:02.446 --> 27:03.839
Hello.

27:20.551 --> 27:22.597
You have to listen to what
I'm saying.

27:22.641 --> 27:25.818
They've evolved or mutated
or something.

27:25.861 --> 27:27.428
The sunlight you think
protects you up here,

27:27.471 --> 27:30.605
it doesn't affect them anymore.

27:30.649 --> 27:31.911
[groans]

27:33.826 --> 27:35.654
Maybe no one's there.

27:36.698 --> 27:38.134
They're there.

27:39.614 --> 27:41.442
Hey!

27:41.485 --> 27:43.487
I am trying to help!

27:45.794 --> 27:46.577
Look.

27:46.621 --> 27:47.622
I need you to calm down.

27:47.666 --> 27:48.884
Lower your voice.

27:48.928 --> 27:50.669
And I need you to listen
to what I am saying.

27:50.712 --> 27:52.018
The woman who processed us
wouldn't listen

27:52.061 --> 27:53.541
and now you won't listen.

27:53.584 --> 27:54.847
If I listen- back up!

27:54.890 --> 27:56.413
Ok.

27:56.457 --> 27:58.241
If I listened to every crack pot
lunatic spouting nonsense

27:58.285 --> 27:59.895
that we've had pass
through here,

27:59.939 --> 28:01.723
Denver'd be no safer than
it is out there.

28:01.767 --> 28:02.942
This isn't nonsense.

28:02.985 --> 28:03.986
You tell the man.

28:04.030 --> 28:06.989
It's true. Every word.

28:07.033 --> 28:08.861
Look, I get it.

28:08.904 --> 28:10.079
I know it sucks.

28:10.123 --> 28:11.907
It sucks everywhere.

28:11.951 --> 28:13.866
But just do your time.

28:13.909 --> 28:16.172
It'll be over before
you know it.

28:19.349 --> 28:22.483
There are vampires walking
around in direct sunlight

28:22.526 --> 28:24.398
more powerful than ever before

28:24.441 --> 28:26.487
and if you think that that wall
of yours is gonna be

28:26.530 --> 28:29.011
strong enough to keep them out
without some preparation

28:29.055 --> 28:31.666
then we might as well be
out there!

28:31.710 --> 28:33.015
You know what?
We're done here.

28:33.059 --> 28:34.495
No! No! No!!!

28:34.538 --> 28:35.757
Get her out of here!

28:35.801 --> 28:37.106
Hey, hey, hey!

28:37.150 --> 28:38.325
Back up, big boy!

28:38.368 --> 28:39.500
Back up!

28:39.543 --> 28:40.588
Let her go.

28:40.631 --> 28:41.937
You think I'm messing with you,
huh?

28:41.981 --> 28:42.633
Back up!

28:42.677 --> 28:44.070
No.

28:44.113 --> 28:46.028
Stay right where you are.

28:50.163 --> 28:51.904
Let her go!

28:52.426 --> 28:53.993
[elevator ding]

29:05.221 --> 29:06.570
Excuse me.

29:07.093 --> 29:08.311
Name?

29:08.355 --> 29:09.182
Fleischman.

29:09.225 --> 29:10.661
Phil Fleischman.

29:10.705 --> 29:13.926
I need to talk to somebody
about getting to Loveland.

29:13.969 --> 29:15.754
You can't go to Loveland.

29:17.407 --> 29:18.669
Why can't I go?

29:18.713 --> 29:21.498
Exactly that.

29:21.542 --> 29:24.588
What, are you- telling me
that Loveland is off limits?

29:24.632 --> 29:26.199
This is what I'm telling you,
man.

29:26.242 --> 29:29.942
Look, even if you could go,
we can't let you leave Denver.

29:29.985 --> 29:31.291
Why not?

29:31.334 --> 29:33.902
You haven't paid off your debt.

29:33.946 --> 29:35.425
What debt?

29:35.469 --> 29:36.818
Well, you were in quarantine.

29:36.862 --> 29:37.950
And in there you were
given board, food

29:37.993 --> 29:40.517
and medical care
that costs money.

29:40.561 --> 29:42.824
Money you repay by working.

29:42.868 --> 29:44.043
Just like the cockroaches,

29:44.086 --> 29:46.393
the taxman survives
the apocalypse.

29:46.436 --> 29:48.003
Right.

29:48.047 --> 29:52.312
So um, basically you're telling
me that this is a prison, too.

29:52.355 --> 29:54.053
No, this is a haven.

29:54.096 --> 29:55.837
That place is a hell hole.

29:55.881 --> 29:56.969
We're done here.

29:57.012 --> 29:58.840
My wife's in that hell hole.

29:58.884 --> 30:00.407
Well, unless you perform
some heinous crime

30:00.450 --> 30:03.802
you won't be seeing her
any time soon.

30:04.846 --> 30:06.369
Is that so?

30:07.936 --> 30:08.937
Woah.

30:15.117 --> 30:15.814
[gun shot]

30:16.727 --> 30:17.772
[gun shot]

30:24.474 --> 30:27.477
[alarm sounding]

30:28.522 --> 30:30.306
Will that do?

30:34.658 --> 30:36.660
Stay down.
Stay down.

30:38.227 --> 30:39.054
Watch out!

30:39.098 --> 30:39.794
Woah!

30:39.838 --> 30:40.577
Stop!

30:40.621 --> 30:42.362
Get on the ground!

30:42.405 --> 30:44.712
Phil?

30:44.755 --> 30:46.714
What did you do?

30:49.064 --> 30:50.849
Get him out of here!

30:55.462 --> 30:58.465
You are now entering
a secured area.

30:58.508 --> 31:00.728
Prepare to present
identification

31:00.771 --> 31:03.992
and surrender all weapons.

31:04.036 --> 31:07.039
I repeat:

31:07.082 --> 31:10.085
You are now entering
a secured area.

31:10.129 --> 31:12.479
Prepare to present
identification

31:12.522 --> 31:15.177
and surrender all weapons.

31:17.527 --> 31:19.268
Something doesn't look right
about these guys.

31:19.312 --> 31:21.575
I'm gonna check 'em out.

31:24.317 --> 31:27.320
You are now entering
a secured area.

31:27.363 --> 31:29.844
Prepare to present
identification

31:29.888 --> 31:32.673
and surrender all weapons.

31:32.716 --> 31:34.414
I repeat:

31:34.457 --> 31:37.939
You are now entering
a secured area.

31:37.983 --> 31:40.376
Prepare to present
identification

31:40.420 --> 31:43.118
and surrender all weapons.

31:43.162 --> 31:44.859
Halt!

31:44.903 --> 31:45.991
Let me see a line up.

31:46.034 --> 31:47.993
Shoulder to shoulder.

31:48.036 --> 31:48.863
Hoods off, heads up.

31:48.907 --> 31:49.908
Come on.

31:52.432 --> 31:53.824
Do it!

31:53.868 --> 31:56.001
Do not make me repeat myself.

[screaming]

32:30.818 --> 32:32.559
What's happening?

32:35.954 --> 32:37.781
I don't know.

32:37.825 --> 32:39.218
I'm gonna find out.

32:39.261 --> 32:40.001
Hey!

32:40.567 --> 32:41.481
Hey!

32:45.267 --> 32:46.790
What's going on out there?

32:47.835 --> 32:50.490
Daywalkers! Run! Run!!!

33:11.598 --> 33:12.207
Hurry up.

33:12.251 --> 33:13.992
Get back.

33:17.778 --> 33:19.258
Move, move!

33:20.085 --> 33:20.868
Stay there.

33:20.911 --> 33:21.608
Don't move!

33:21.651 --> 33:22.522
Go, go, go!

33:22.565 --> 33:23.697
Get back!

33:24.219 --> 33:25.307
How'd they get here?

33:25.786 --> 33:26.874
Open fire! Go, go!

33:26.917 --> 33:27.527
Come on!

33:27.570 --> 33:30.008

Kill them!

[baby crying]

33:44.283 --> 33:45.936
Shh.

33:47.895 --> 33:49.114
This better be important.

33:49.157 --> 33:50.637
I wouldn't have called you
if it wasn't.

33:50.680 --> 33:52.508
Oh, you managed to solve our
problem already, have you?

33:52.552 --> 33:56.251
No, but I have had
a breakthrough.

33:56.295 --> 33:57.470
That's great news.

33:57.513 --> 33:59.254
Yeah, it was under my nose
the whole time.

33:59.298 --> 34:00.864
You should take a look.

34:02.997 --> 34:04.651
What is it I'm looking at?

34:04.694 --> 34:07.741
You're smart, right?

34:07.784 --> 34:10.178
You'll know when you see it.

34:11.788 --> 34:13.834
There's no difference in
the compositional structure

34:13.877 --> 34:16.402
from our original formula.

34:16.445 --> 34:18.534
There's no breakthrough here.

34:18.578 --> 34:21.015
Oh, I didn't say I had
a breakthrough with
your problem.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.625
I had a breakthrough with mine.

34:25.802 --> 34:27.717

34:42.776 --> 34:43.951
I knew you were too much
of a chicken shit

34:43.994 --> 34:45.822
to take your own repellant.

34:45.866 --> 34:49.087
[gasping]

34:50.784 --> 34:53.961
Oh yeah, I remember this part.

34:54.004 --> 34:56.355
You should start to feel it now.

34:59.009 --> 35:02.535
It hurts, doesn't it, Caitlin?

35:02.578 --> 35:05.929
[gasping]

35:08.889 --> 35:10.717
Good.

35:10.760 --> 35:12.414
[gun shot]

36:05.075 --> 36:06.599
Thank god.

36:08.122 --> 36:09.645
Barry?

36:14.346 --> 36:20.656
Oh... we gotta get
outta here.

36:20.700 --> 36:21.396
The baby.

36:21.440 --> 36:22.484
Yeah, she's ok.

36:22.528 --> 36:24.138
Yeah, we gotta get outta here,
now!

36:24.182 --> 36:25.966
Let's go.

36:50.730 --> 36:54.516
Rats, trapped in a cage.

36:55.343 --> 36:57.867
Release the brethren.

37:15.929 --> 37:19.411
Turn the strong and keep
the young ones for food.

37:19.454 --> 37:20.977
Go!

[gun shots]

37:31.553 --> 37:34.774
[screaming]

37:35.905 --> 37:37.342
We're almost done.

37:37.385 --> 37:39.431
Go kill them for me.

38:15.205 --> 38:15.989
What're you doing?

38:16.032 --> 38:16.903
Can't you hear that siren?

38:16.946 --> 38:18.339
I'm fixing this.

38:18.383 --> 38:19.688
You guys never noticed this?
It's driving me crazy.

38:19.732 --> 38:20.820
We need to leave.

38:20.863 --> 38:24.432
Why? That thing goes off
all the time.

38:24.476 --> 38:26.173
Daywalkers.

38:26.216 --> 38:29.524
They've breached the perimeter
and we need to leave now.

38:29.568 --> 38:30.873
Oh my god.

38:30.917 --> 38:32.266
Here.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.355
We gotta find a way out of here.

38:34.399 --> 38:35.835
They're gonna shut
the sector down fast.

38:35.878 --> 38:36.749
We need to move.

38:36.792 --> 38:38.316
Let's go.

38:46.411 --> 38:47.673
Jolene!

38:47.716 --> 38:48.978
What the hell? Stop!

38:49.022 --> 38:51.024
Jolene! Jolene!

38:52.417 --> 38:53.374
Shit!

38:53.418 --> 38:54.549
What are you doing here?

38:54.593 --> 38:55.724
This whole sector's
under evac orders.

38:55.768 --> 38:56.986
Where are all the prisoners?

38:57.030 --> 38:57.987
Well, they're on the bus headed
to Loveland.

38:58.031 --> 38:59.380
The bus is leaving right now.

38:59.424 --> 39:00.686
Oh god, that can't be right.
That can't be right.

39:00.729 --> 39:02.209
Is there somewhere else you hold
the prisoners?

39:02.252 --> 39:04.211
If they were in here
they're on that bus.

39:04.820 --> 39:05.865
No!

39:14.482 --> 39:15.265
Stop the bus!

39:15.309 --> 39:17.137
Hey! Hey!

39:17.180 --> 39:18.921
Stop the bus!

39:18.965 --> 39:19.748
Wait! Jolene!

39:19.792 --> 39:20.967
Stop the bus!

39:21.010 --> 39:22.142
Stop the goddamn bus!

Oh my god,
you've been bit!

40:14.324 --> 40:15.587
What the hell,
you're healing?

40:15.630 --> 40:16.588
I'll explain later.

40:16.631 --> 40:17.850
We have to move.

40:17.893 --> 40:19.547
Damn right you will.
