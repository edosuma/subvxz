00:51.343 --> 00:53.554
That's the last of the equipment
gone.

00:53.595 --> 00:56.515
The maids have put the drawing room
back to normal.

01:10.696 --> 01:14.116
I'm walking down to the village.
I want to have a word with Travis.

01:14.157 --> 01:16.075
Richard will be here any moment.

01:16.076 --> 01:19.830
That's why I'm telling you. Give him
my excuses. I'll see him at dinner.

01:19.872 --> 01:22.249
Is there any news on
the Bates situation?

01:22.291 --> 01:24.334
Not that I'm aware of.

01:24.376 --> 01:26.336
So you still want to keep him on?

01:26.378 --> 01:29.923
Cora, Bates's wife has committed
suicide. It's very sad, of course,

01:29.965 --> 01:32.801
but not, when I last looked,
a reason to sack him.

01:34.136 --> 01:36.221
They've taken the rest of the beds.

01:38.724 --> 01:42.436
So that's the finish of it.
Not quite. We still have Matthew.

01:42.477 --> 01:45.898
And I wanted to ask you,
isn't it time he went home?

01:46.690 --> 01:48.775
I see. You want to throw him out.

01:48.817 --> 01:53.697
Robert. I want him to learn to be
as independent as he can.

01:53.739 --> 01:56.909
And I want Mary to get on with her
life. What's wrong with that?

01:56.950 --> 01:59.870
Is there something you're not
telling me? What do you mean?

01:59.912 --> 02:03.207
About Mary. And Matthew.
Some element you haven't told me?

02:03.248 --> 02:05.792
Of course not. You're being silly.

02:06.502 --> 02:09.213
If thinking that trying
to protect Mary with a

02:09.253 --> 02:11.924
ring of steel is silly,
then yes, I am very silly.

02:28.273 --> 02:29.858
You shouldn't be doing that.

02:29.900 --> 02:33.946
Let us hope the end of the war brings
the return of the footman, Mr Crawley.

02:34.029 --> 02:37.783
Do you think they will return?
I certainly hope so.

02:37.824 --> 02:41.245
I'm sure Sir Richard can buy you
a dozen when you get to Haxby.

02:52.923 --> 02:57.052
Let me.
No, m'lord. I can manage.

02:57.094 --> 02:59.012
The handle broke.

02:59.054 --> 03:02.266
Aren't we feeding you? They're from
my mother's apple store.

03:02.307 --> 03:04.309
She always loads me up.

03:07.104 --> 03:10.065
How's your boy doing? Freddie?

03:11.149 --> 03:14.403
Yes, Freddie. He's doing very well.

03:14.444 --> 03:18.282
I wrote to the headmaster of Ripon
Grammar. I said to look out for him.

03:18.323 --> 03:21.410
That, that's so kind, m'lord.

03:21.451 --> 03:24.621
I hope it works. I don't see why it
should, but you never know.

03:27.624 --> 03:30.085
I suppose you miss your husband very
much?

03:31.545 --> 03:33.630
Of course.

03:34.798 --> 03:36.758
But I have Freddie...

03:36.800 --> 03:40.512
and when you think of what some
families have gone through. I know.

03:40.554 --> 03:43.724
Almost 30 dead on this estate alone.

03:43.765 --> 03:46.977
And the Elcots down at Longway
lost three out of four sons.

03:47.019 --> 03:51.481
Mrs Carter's only boy was killed
a month before the end of the war.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.362
Poor William.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.615
And then there's Matthew.

04:04.745 --> 04:07.164
Do you ever wonder
what it was all for?

04:17.007 --> 04:19.091
I'd better go in, m'lord.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.738
The train was late.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.823
Welcome to the new world.

04:41.907 --> 04:44.493
When a war is over,
the first emotion is relief.

04:44.576 --> 04:46.995
The second, disappointment.

04:47.037 --> 04:49.248
How sad.

04:49.331 --> 04:51.458
But how true.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.585
Come in and have some tea.

04:58.799 --> 05:01.385
Will you miss the extra staff,
Mrs Patmore?

05:01.426 --> 05:05.597
Not really. When push comes to shove,
I'd rather do it myself.

05:06.598 --> 05:08.851
Though God knows what I'm to feed
them on.

05:08.892 --> 05:11.562
There's nothing out there to be had.
Well.

05:11.603 --> 05:14.731
The Lord tempers the wind
to the shorn lamb.

05:16.191 --> 05:19.319
What about you, Thomas?
How much longer will you stay?

05:19.361 --> 05:23.031
Well, now the last of the invalids
have gone, I suppose I'm finished.

05:23.073 --> 05:27.035
I'll report to Major Clarkson,
but he won't be taking anyone on.

05:27.995 --> 05:31.373
I suppose the hospital will revert
to the way it was before the war.

05:31.415 --> 05:33.792
Where will you go?
What's it to you?

05:45.762 --> 05:48.473
Where will you go?
I'll tell you where I'm going.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.559
Into business. It's all set up.

05:51.226 --> 05:53.312
Do you mean black market business?

05:53.353 --> 05:55.439
Don't look so surprised.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.691
I've found a dealer
and as soon as I make

05:57.733 --> 05:59.943
the payment, I'll
have the supplies.

06:01.236 --> 06:04.323
Where will you keep them?
I've got a shed in the village

06:04.364 --> 06:06.867
and I'll get a banger
to deliver the stuff.

06:06.909 --> 06:10.162
I'll be well fixed as soon as word
gets out. You heard her.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.289
There are shortages all around.

06:14.166 --> 06:16.335
Isn't it dangerous?
I don't think so.

06:16.376 --> 06:20.464
I don't think the police are bothered
about rationing, now the war's over.

06:20.506 --> 06:23.759
It won't last forever
but by the time it's done,

06:23.800 --> 06:26.887
I should have enough
to go into business, properly.

06:26.929 --> 06:29.431
So that's your future settled
as a plutocrat.

06:29.473 --> 06:32.142
In the meantime, have you found
somewhere to live?

06:32.184 --> 06:34.269
Not yet, but there's no hurry.

06:34.311 --> 06:37.648
I'm sure they won't object
if I stop here for a week or two.

06:37.689 --> 06:39.775
I shouldn't bet on it.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.784
I nearly put out
the new dinner jacket, m'lord,

06:48.825 --> 06:52.454
but then Mr Carson said the Dowager
was dining here. Quite right.

06:52.496 --> 06:54.581
Mustn't frighten the horses.

06:56.041 --> 07:00.546
By the way, her ladyship was asking if
there was any more news about Mrs Bates.

07:01.338 --> 07:03.423
I don't think so, m'lord.

07:04.341 --> 07:07.970
They'd like to know why she did it,
but I don't suppose we ever shall.

07:08.011 --> 07:09.972
You'd think she'd leave a note.

07:10.013 --> 07:13.517
Perhaps it was a spur of the moment
decision. It can't have been.

07:13.559 --> 07:16.061
Wouldn't she have to get hold
of the stuff?

07:20.148 --> 07:23.902
Please forgive me. I was thinking
aloud. We'll drop the subject.

07:26.488 --> 07:28.574
Anna.

07:31.201 --> 07:33.745
It is Anna, isn't it? Yes sir.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.915
I want to ask a favor of you.
Of me, Sir Richard.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.042
You. I've been waiting for you.

07:39.084 --> 07:42.087
I wonder if you could step into
my room for a moment.

07:52.931 --> 07:57.144
You attend Lady Mary
and her sisters... don't you?

07:57.186 --> 07:59.605
In addition to your other duties.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.732
I do, sir, yes.

08:01.773 --> 08:05.277
You must be kept very busy.
I hope it's worth your while.

08:06.904 --> 08:10.657
Because I would be very willing
to increase your stipend.

08:10.699 --> 08:13.911
If this is about coming with
Lady Mary when you marry,

08:13.952 --> 08:16.038
it's very good of you, sir,
but you see,

08:16.079 --> 08:18.832
my fiancÃ©, Mr Bates, works here
and I don't think I...

08:18.874 --> 08:21.335
No, it's not that.
Although it's a pity.

08:21.376 --> 08:23.462
Lady Mary's very fond of you.

08:24.922 --> 08:27.007
That's kind.

08:27.549 --> 08:32.513
You see...
I'm anxious to make Lady Mary happy.

08:33.597 --> 08:36.850
Of course you are, sir. And to that
end, I feel I need to know

08:36.892 --> 08:39.311
a great deal more about her
than I do.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.856
Our customs are so strange
in this country.

08:42.898 --> 08:45.317
A couple is hardly
allowed a moment alone

08:45.359 --> 08:47.694
together before they
walk down the aisle.

08:47.736 --> 08:49.863
I'm not sure I understand, sir.

08:51.573 --> 08:54.284
I'd like to know more
about her interests.

08:55.994 --> 09:00.582
Where she goes, whom she sees.
What she says to them.

09:00.832 --> 09:04.044
Excuse me, sir. Do you mean
you want me to give you

09:04.086 --> 09:06.255
a report of Lady Mary's actions?

09:06.296 --> 09:09.132
It will be extra work,
but I'm happy to pay.

09:10.008 --> 09:12.135
I'm sure.

09:12.177 --> 09:15.430
But I'm afraid I wouldn't have
the time. Thank you, sir.

09:17.599 --> 09:19.685
It's your choice, of course.

09:22.604 --> 09:25.858
I'd be grateful if you didn't
mention this to Lady Mary.

09:26.608 --> 09:29.611
I wouldn't want her to think I was
checking up on her.

09:41.540 --> 09:44.001
I nearly came down in a dinner jacket
tonight.

09:44.042 --> 09:46.378
Really? Well, why not a dressing
gown?

09:46.420 --> 09:48.505
Or better still, pajamas?

09:48.547 --> 09:50.549
That's why I didn't.

09:50.591 --> 09:55.095
I like the new fashions.
Shorter skirts, looser cuts.

09:55.137 --> 09:58.015
The old clothes were all very well
if one spent the day

09:58.098 --> 10:01.101
on a chaise longue, but if one
wants to get anything done,

10:01.143 --> 10:03.061
the new clothes are much better.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.147
I'll stick to the chaise longue.

10:05.189 --> 10:08.692
Granny, you don't want things to go
back to the way they were, surely?

10:08.734 --> 10:11.570
Of course I do,
and as quickly as possible.

10:11.653 --> 10:14.031
What about you, Papa?

10:14.072 --> 10:16.366
Before the war,
I believed my life had value.

10:16.408 --> 10:18.702
I suppose I should like
to feel that again.

10:24.750 --> 10:28.420
Have you seen the boys' haircuts
the women are wearing in Paris?

10:28.462 --> 10:30.547
I hope you won't try that.

10:31.882 --> 10:33.967
I might.

10:34.009 --> 10:36.053
I'm not sure how feminine it is.

10:36.094 --> 10:40.307
I'm not sure how feminine I am.
Very, I'm glad to say.

10:42.726 --> 10:45.187
Carson, I keep forgetting
to tell Mrs Hughes

10:45.229 --> 10:47.689
we've had a letter from
Major Bryant's mother.

10:47.773 --> 10:50.275
She and her husband are in Yorkshire
on Friday

10:50.317 --> 10:52.402
and she wants to pay us a visit.
Why?

10:52.444 --> 10:55.822
The last time they saw him alive,
it was here. I can understand.

10:55.864 --> 10:59.243
Will they be staying, my lady?
No, but we'll give them luncheon.

10:59.284 --> 11:02.829
That way they can talk about the
Major with all of us who knew him.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.916
That lets me out, thank heaven.

11:15.050 --> 11:17.135
You look very fine.

11:18.512 --> 11:21.139
Everything I own is from my season
before the war.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.267
I'm trying to wear them out.

11:25.561 --> 11:28.981
Where have you been all day?
Nowhere. I've just been busy.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.234
I envy you.

11:32.276 --> 11:35.863
I feel so flat after the rush and
bustle of the last two years.

11:37.114 --> 11:39.324
They were sighing for the old days
at dinner,

11:39.366 --> 11:41.493
but all I could think
about was how much

11:41.535 --> 11:43.662
more I want from life
now than I did then.

11:43.704 --> 11:47.457
Does this mean that you've made up
your mind, at last?

11:50.460 --> 11:53.589
No, not quite, but almost.

11:57.176 --> 11:59.261
What do you mean,
'how did she say it?'

11:59.303 --> 12:02.890
Mr and Mrs Bryant are coming
for luncheon on Friday.

12:02.931 --> 12:07.686
How are things over at Haxby?
Pretty good.

12:07.728 --> 12:10.731
Building materials
are in short supply,

12:10.772 --> 12:13.400
but Sir Richard knows
how to get around that.

12:13.692 --> 12:15.777
I bet he does.

12:15.819 --> 12:19.656
Well, you should see some of the
gadgets in the kitchens.

12:19.698 --> 12:22.242
And the bathrooms - oh, goodness me!

12:22.284 --> 12:25.245
They're like something out of a film
with Theda Bara.

12:25.287 --> 12:28.540
I'm surprised you know
who Theda Bara is.

12:28.582 --> 12:31.543
I get about, Mrs Hughes,
I get about.

12:31.585 --> 12:36.215
But will you be happy there?
That's what I want to be sure of.

12:37.549 --> 12:41.220
If you're asking whether
I'll regret leaving Downton...

12:43.472 --> 12:46.141
I will regret it
every minute of every day.

12:47.226 --> 12:49.311
I thought I would die here...

12:49.353 --> 12:51.563
and haunt it ever after.

12:51.605 --> 12:53.690
Well, then!

12:53.732 --> 12:57.569
You see, I think I can help her.

12:58.403 --> 13:01.532
In those early years when it's
important to get it right.

13:01.573 --> 13:06.119
And if I can help her... then I must.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.206
I wish I could understand.

13:10.207 --> 13:12.543
To me, Lady Mary is an uppity minx

13:12.584 --> 13:15.295
who's the author of her own
misfortunes.

13:15.337 --> 13:19.216
You didn't know her
when she was a child, Mrs Hughes.

13:19.258 --> 13:21.343
She was a guinea a minute then.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.180
I remember once she came in here,

13:25.222 --> 13:28.058
she can't have been more than
four or five years old.

13:28.100 --> 13:32.396
She said, 'Mr Carson,
I've decided to run away

13:32.437 --> 13:35.732
and I wonder if I might take
some of the silver to sell. '

13:37.901 --> 13:41.655
'Well, ' I said, 'that could be
awkward for his Lordship.

13:41.697 --> 13:45.534
Suppose I give you sixpence to spend
in the village instead?'

13:45.576 --> 13:51.081
'Very well, ' says she. 'But you must
be sure to charge me interest. '

13:52.749 --> 13:54.710
And did you?

13:54.751 --> 13:57.880
She gave me a kiss in full payment.

13:59.173 --> 14:01.592
Then she had the better bargain.

14:05.846 --> 14:07.931
I wouldn't say that.

14:10.684 --> 14:13.645
There you are, Mrs Hughes.
They said you were in here.

14:13.687 --> 14:18.233
Might I have a word?
Of course. Shall we go to my room?

14:18.275 --> 14:20.986
There's no reason Mr Carson
shouldn't hear it.

14:21.028 --> 14:23.113
In fact, I think he probably should.

14:24.156 --> 14:28.660
You see, I've had a request from Sir
Richard that you ought to know about.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.627
You've done this before.

14:40.214 --> 14:42.299
Bates, can I ask you something?

14:42.341 --> 14:47.054
If I started to feel a tingling
in my legs,

14:47.095 --> 14:49.765
what do you think that might mean?

14:49.806 --> 14:51.850
Have you told Dr Clarkson?

14:51.892 --> 14:53.977
Yes, he says it's an illusion.

14:55.437 --> 14:57.981
Memory of a tingling or something.

14:58.023 --> 15:00.609
But, I mean,
I do know my back is broken.

15:00.651 --> 15:03.153
I understand that I won't recover,
but...

15:04.196 --> 15:06.406
I do keep feeling it.
Or I think I do.

15:06.448 --> 15:08.200
I should wait and see.

15:08.242 --> 15:11.119
If something is changing,
it will make itself known.

15:11.161 --> 15:14.081
Now will that be all?
Yes, thank you.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.669
Bates...

15:20.003 --> 15:22.089
Please don't tell anyone.

15:22.464 --> 15:27.177
I couldn't bear it if Miss Swire
or mother or...

15:28.554 --> 15:30.514
or anyone started to hope.

15:30.556 --> 15:32.683
I won't say a thing.

15:32.724 --> 15:34.810
Good night, sir.

15:36.895 --> 15:38.981
Morning.

15:42.359 --> 15:44.152
Morning.

15:53.078 --> 15:55.998
I don't know why I'm doing this.
I must be out of my mind.

15:56.039 --> 15:59.626
Because you know it's my last chance.
That's true. They won't be back.

15:59.668 --> 16:02.045
Not after this trip.
So what should I do?

16:02.087 --> 16:05.507
Come to the house. But stay outside
in the game larder.

16:05.549 --> 16:08.510
I'll leave some food there
and a blanket,

16:08.552 --> 16:11.638
and then I'll try and find a moment
alone with Mrs Bryant

16:11.680 --> 16:14.141
and tell her about little Charlie.

16:14.183 --> 16:17.936
And then, if she asks -
only if she asks, mind you...

16:17.978 --> 16:21.356
I'll bring her out to see the child.
What about him?

16:22.566 --> 16:26.403
If either of them are in the least
interested, it'll be the mother.

16:26.445 --> 16:29.406
And do you think she'll help me?
She might.

16:31.200 --> 16:32.910
Suppose she won't see him.

16:32.951 --> 16:35.412
Then you're no worse off than you
are already.

16:35.454 --> 16:38.248
Look, I shouldn't be doing it.
So if you're not keen,

16:38.290 --> 16:41.543
then for heaven's sake
let's forget all about it. No...

16:41.585 --> 16:43.670
I'll be there. I promise.

16:44.546 --> 16:47.090
Doesn't it feel odd
to have the rooms back?

16:47.132 --> 16:49.218
And only us to sit in them.

16:49.801 --> 16:53.347
I suppose we'll get used to it.
I don't want to get used to it.

16:53.388 --> 16:55.474
What do you mean?

16:56.725 --> 16:59.061
I know what it is to work now.

16:59.102 --> 17:02.022
To have a full day.
To be tired in a good way.

17:02.064 --> 17:05.400
I don't want to start dress fittings
or paying calls,

17:05.442 --> 17:09.404
or standing behind the guns.
But how does one escape all that?

17:09.445 --> 17:13.617
I think I've found a way to escape.
Nothing too drastic, I hope.

17:13.659 --> 17:17.119
It is drastic. There's no going back
once I've done it.

17:17.162 --> 17:19.830
But that's what I want.
No going back.

17:21.124 --> 17:23.210
I don't want to go back, either.

17:24.169 --> 17:26.255
Then don't.

17:26.630 --> 17:29.842
You're far nicer than you were before
the war, you know.

17:49.236 --> 17:52.656
Where did you get it all?
I told you. This bloke from Leeds.

17:52.698 --> 17:55.117
Where did he get it?

17:55.158 --> 17:57.828
Some's army surplus,
some's from America.

17:57.870 --> 17:59.872
And Ireland. Everywhere.

17:59.913 --> 18:02.958
He's got contacts all over.
That's what I'm paying him for.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.085
How much have you paid him?
A lot.

18:06.920 --> 18:10.007
But I'm not worried.
I've taken nothing perishable.

18:10.048 --> 18:12.092
This lot will last for months.

18:12.134 --> 18:14.970
I'll be sold out
long before any of it's gone off.

18:15.012 --> 18:17.097
Starting with Mrs Patmore.

18:17.139 --> 18:19.099
But Carson if you're abandoning me,

18:19.141 --> 18:21.268
I think I deserve to know
the reason why.

18:21.310 --> 18:24.980
I do not believe that Sir Richard
and I would work well together.

18:25.063 --> 18:27.232
But there must be more to it
than that.

18:28.108 --> 18:30.152
You knew what Sir Richard was like.

18:30.194 --> 18:34.156
We were to educate him, together,
you and I. Wasn't that the plan?

18:34.198 --> 18:37.409
Sir Richard offered Anna
a sum of money

18:37.451 --> 18:39.828
to report your activities to him.

18:39.870 --> 18:42.497
Whom you saw, what you said.

18:42.539 --> 18:46.710
He wanted her to spy on me?
Naturally he used a different word.

18:46.752 --> 18:48.837
Naturally.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.257
And she refused?

18:52.299 --> 18:55.719
She refused and she reported the
offer to Mrs Hughes and me.

18:57.429 --> 18:59.973
Well, I wish she'd come to me first.

19:01.934 --> 19:04.603
So you mean you'd be uncomfortable?

19:04.645 --> 19:07.439
Working for a spymaster?

19:08.649 --> 19:10.734
How disappointing of you.

19:11.693 --> 19:14.071
And I always thought
you were fond of me.

19:14.112 --> 19:16.740
There you are.

19:18.909 --> 19:22.496
What about a quick walk before
dinner? We ought to change first.

19:23.956 --> 19:27.626
Will that be all, my lady?
Yes, Carson. Thank you.

19:29.086 --> 19:31.171
I think that WILL be all.

19:32.214 --> 19:35.175
Carson has decided not to come with
us to Haxby.

19:36.593 --> 19:40.514
I'm sorry. Is there anything I
can say to change your mind?

19:41.723 --> 19:43.809
I'm afraid not, sir.

19:46.687 --> 19:48.772
What a shame.

19:48.814 --> 19:51.984
Not really.
Butlers will be two a penny

19:52.025 --> 19:54.111
now they're all back from the war.

20:02.202 --> 20:04.413
I gather Carson was looking for me.

20:04.454 --> 20:07.249
Shall I go and find him, m'lord?

20:07.291 --> 20:10.419
It's all right. Tell him I'll be
in the dressing room.

20:11.295 --> 20:14.590
Has he done the red wine, yet?
It's over here, m'lord.

20:16.758 --> 20:19.887
I'm pleased. It's a new one on me.

20:19.928 --> 20:23.557
I had some at a dinner in London
and ordered it.

20:24.850 --> 20:27.394
Carson thought we might try it
tonight.

20:30.564 --> 20:32.649
Well, I'd better go up.

20:32.691 --> 20:36.945
You made me sad yesterday.
Wondering what the war was for.

20:36.987 --> 20:39.072
Don't listen to me.

20:39.990 --> 20:41.909
I'm a foolish man who's lost his way

20:41.950 --> 20:44.369
and don't quite know
how to find it again.

20:55.756 --> 20:57.841
I'm terribly sorry.

20:57.883 --> 21:00.594
Please try to forgive me.

21:02.054 --> 21:04.139
I do forgive you.

21:11.897 --> 21:13.857
Mr Carson.

21:13.899 --> 21:16.860
His lordship said you were looking
for him.

21:16.902 --> 21:19.029
And?

21:19.071 --> 21:22.699
And well, I was to say that you'd
find him in the dressing room.

21:22.741 --> 21:25.577
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.

21:32.084 --> 21:34.878
I wrestled with it, m'lord,
I don't mind admitting.

21:34.920 --> 21:38.590
And I wanted to be there
to help Lady Mary, and...

21:38.632 --> 21:41.009
And protect her from Sir Richard.

21:41.051 --> 21:47.683
Well, I wouldn't quite have put it
like that, but yes, I suppose.

21:48.559 --> 21:51.144
Only... Only you felt
you couldn't work for a man

21:51.186 --> 21:54.356
who would offer a bribe?
That is correct, m'lord.

21:55.482 --> 21:57.693
Are you quite sure you
won't regret it?

21:57.734 --> 21:59.736
I know how fond you are of
Lady Mary.

22:01.113 --> 22:03.907
But I couldn't work for a man
that I don't respect.

22:03.949 --> 22:07.452
And I certainly couldn't have left
Downton for him.

22:07.494 --> 22:11.915
I shall take that as a compliment.
For myself and for my house.

22:12.875 --> 22:15.669
I still don't see
why you didn't tell me first.

22:15.711 --> 22:19.214
I'm sorry, m'lady, but I didn't want
to add to your troubles.

22:19.256 --> 22:22.176
Well, you have done,
whether you wanted to or not.

22:24.553 --> 22:26.805
Nobody's down yet.
They won't be long.

22:28.265 --> 22:31.727
Look. They've cleared the tea
but forgotten to take that tray.

22:31.768 --> 22:35.355
Ring the bell. I'll do it. They'll be
busy getting dinner ready.

22:35.397 --> 22:38.108
It's too heavy for you.
No, it's not. Look out!

22:39.193 --> 22:41.278
Heavens, that was a near thing.

22:43.197 --> 22:45.282
My God...

22:47.784 --> 22:49.912
Mary! Girls!

22:49.953 --> 22:52.664
Cora! Come at once!
Robert wait.

22:52.706 --> 22:56.084
Everyone come at once.
What is it? What's happened?

22:56.126 --> 22:58.212
Come and see this.

23:08.388 --> 23:11.683
Is it true?
Is it true what Lavinia says?

23:17.856 --> 23:20.067
I don't believe it!
It's so wonderful.

23:20.108 --> 23:22.069
It is, but don't tire yourself out.

23:22.110 --> 23:24.821
Sit down now and we'll send for
Dr Clarkson.

23:24.863 --> 23:27.032
She's right. Edith, go with Branson.

23:27.074 --> 23:30.744
Get Clarkson, but fetch Mama
and Cousin Isobel as well.

23:30.786 --> 23:33.830
I don't care what they're doing.
Tell them to come now!

23:33.872 --> 23:35.874
My dear chap.

23:35.916 --> 23:38.377
I cannot begin to tell you what this
means to me.

23:38.418 --> 23:41.004
It's pretty good news for me, too.

23:42.130 --> 23:44.925
There is only one possible
explanation.

23:46.301 --> 23:48.387
It starts with my own mistake.

23:48.428 --> 23:52.516
Every indication told me
that the spine was transected,

23:52.558 --> 23:54.560
which would have been incurable.

23:54.601 --> 23:58.188
But when Sir John Coates came to see
Matthew, he agreed with you.

23:59.565 --> 24:01.900
Well, he didn't. Not entirely.

24:01.942 --> 24:06.154
He thought that it could conceivably
be a case of spinal shock.

24:06.196 --> 24:09.074
That is, um, intense bruising.

24:09.116 --> 24:13.370
Which was sufficiently severe
to impede the leg mechanism.

24:13.412 --> 24:15.497
But which would heal?

24:15.539 --> 24:17.583
Why didn't you tell us?

24:17.624 --> 24:19.710
Because I didn't agree with him...

24:20.794 --> 24:24.923
and I didn't want to raise Captain
Crawley's hopes to no purpose.

24:24.965 --> 24:27.885
I understand and I don't blame you.

24:28.677 --> 24:32.097
You must take it slowly.
Rome wasn't built in a day. I know.

24:32.139 --> 24:36.518
And I'm afraid you will carry a bruise
on your spine for the rest of your life.

24:36.560 --> 24:39.438
But I will have a life? Yes.

24:40.689 --> 24:43.066
I think we can say that.
You will have a

24:43.108 --> 24:45.402
normal life and it won't
be long in coming.

24:46.862 --> 24:48.947
My darling boy.

24:50.032 --> 24:52.117
My darling boy.

24:54.244 --> 24:56.454
Excuse me, m'lord,
but Mrs Hughes is

24:56.455 --> 24:58.665
wondering what she
should do about dinner.

24:58.707 --> 25:01.001
You'll all stay for dinner,
won't you?

25:01.043 --> 25:04.338
I'm afraid I'm not dressed. Never
mind that. Who cares about that?

25:04.379 --> 25:06.673
What about you, Mama?
Certainly.

25:06.715 --> 25:10.427
All this unbridled joy has given me
quite an appetite.

25:12.804 --> 25:15.682
There you are. I wondered what had
happened to you.

25:15.724 --> 25:18.936
It's wonderful news, isn't it?
Wonderful. Are you busy?

25:18.977 --> 25:22.314
I'm just going up to help in the
dining room. Why? It'll keep.

25:22.356 --> 25:25.692
No. Tell me. I've got time.

25:25.734 --> 25:30.030
It's just something his lordship said
recently, I can't get out of my mind.

25:30.072 --> 25:34.201
How Vera must have bought the poison
and taken it home with her.

25:35.911 --> 25:38.330
Yes. I suppose she must.

25:38.372 --> 25:41.458
And it's... a terrible thing
to think of.

25:41.500 --> 25:43.585
But she didn't. I did.

25:44.336 --> 25:46.755
What?
Months ago, before I left.

25:46.797 --> 25:49.591
Vera said we needed rat poison
and I bought it.

25:49.633 --> 25:53.095
It was Arsenic. I've been thinking
that's what she must have taken.

25:53.136 --> 25:55.514
Have you told the police?
No. Tell them.

25:55.556 --> 25:58.225
If you don't and they find out,
it'll look bad.

25:58.267 --> 26:01.937
But wouldn't I be asking for
trouble? You are if you stay silent.

26:02.813 --> 26:05.816
Anna, we're starting.
Sorry, Mr Carson.

26:08.694 --> 26:11.697
Tell me, how are things progressing
at Haxby?

26:11.738 --> 26:14.616
Quite well. I've put in a condition

26:14.658 --> 26:17.578
so the builders are fined for every
day they go over.

26:17.619 --> 26:20.914
Does that make for a happy
atmosphere? I want it done.

26:20.956 --> 26:23.041
They can be happy in their own time.

26:23.083 --> 26:25.002
Why the rush?

26:25.043 --> 26:28.005
I like everything I own to be
finished and ready to sell.

26:28.046 --> 26:31.383
You're not thinking of selling
Haxby, surely?

26:31.425 --> 26:35.804
Depends. We'll have to see if it
suits us, to be so close to Downton.

26:37.306 --> 26:39.516
I... I want to tell you all
something.

26:41.143 --> 26:45.480
As you know, during this... well,
I think I can say horrible time...

26:46.523 --> 26:49.526
Lavinia has proved to be
the most marvellous person.

26:49.568 --> 26:51.445
Hear, hear. Indeed.

26:51.486 --> 26:54.573
I never thought we would marry,
for all sorts of reasons,

26:54.615 --> 26:57.868
but she wouldn't accept that
and so now I am very pleased to say

26:57.910 --> 26:59.995
that she's been proved right.

27:03.165 --> 27:06.293
Lavinia and I will get married.
My dear fellow.

27:06.335 --> 27:10.047
Isn't it wonderful? As soon as I'm
well enough to walk down the aisle.

27:10.088 --> 27:12.925
Dr Clarkson can help us with when.
Not long now.

27:12.966 --> 27:17.387
And she feels we ought to marry here,
at Downton.

27:18.597 --> 27:21.308
To bury forever the memories of what
I hope has been

27:21.350 --> 27:23.435
the darkest period of my life.

27:24.019 --> 27:26.355
- Of course!
- Are you sure?

27:26.396 --> 27:28.649
I know it should be at my home
in London,

27:28.690 --> 27:30.651
but we've been through so much here.

27:30.692 --> 27:35.489
We'd be delighted.
Bravo! Excellent news.

27:36.782 --> 27:39.117
Mary, isn't that excellent news?

27:39.159 --> 27:41.662
Just excellent.

27:57.845 --> 28:00.931
You're very late. Won't they worry?

28:03.100 --> 28:06.103
They're all so excited,
they won't care where I am.

28:08.105 --> 28:11.316
I'm pleased. I like Mr Matthew.

28:11.358 --> 28:14.987
He announced at dinner that
he wants to get married at Downton.

28:15.028 --> 28:17.239
Somehow, it made me feel
more than ever

28:17.281 --> 28:21.702
that the war is really over...
and it's time to move forward.

28:22.995 --> 28:25.205
Do you mean you've made your
decision?

28:25.789 --> 28:27.708
Yes.

28:29.376 --> 28:33.380
My answer is...
that I'm ready to travel...

28:35.507 --> 28:38.260
and you're my ticket.

28:38.302 --> 28:41.013
To get away from this house,
away from this life.

28:41.054 --> 28:42.681
Me?

28:42.723 --> 28:44.766
No. Uncle Tom Cobley.

28:48.562 --> 28:50.647
I'm sorry.

28:50.689 --> 28:52.983
But I've waited so long
for those words,

28:53.025 --> 28:55.444
I can't believe I'm hearing them.

28:57.738 --> 29:00.490
You won't mind burning your bridges?
Mind?

29:00.532 --> 29:02.743
Fetch me the matches!

29:04.328 --> 29:09.374
Yes, you can kiss me, but that is
all until everything is settled.

29:10.626 --> 29:13.545
For now, God knows it's enough
that I can kiss you.

29:21.220 --> 29:25.015
What a day. I can't stop smiling.

29:26.183 --> 29:31.313
No. But another time, please ask me
before you agree to host a wedding.

29:31.355 --> 29:34.024
What?
I'm fond of Matthew, of course,

29:34.066 --> 29:37.486
but you do realize this means
Mary's marriage will be delayed?

29:37.528 --> 29:40.906
I can't help that.
Mary is our first priority, Robert.

29:40.948 --> 29:43.116
And just because Matthew's been lame.

29:43.158 --> 29:45.285
Matthew's been lame?!

29:45.953 --> 29:48.497
Can you hear the words
coming out of your mouth?

29:48.539 --> 29:51.041
Can you hear how stupid
and selfish they are?

29:51.083 --> 29:53.168
Because I can.

29:55.754 --> 29:57.714
Don't bother me with it now.

29:57.756 --> 30:01.134
I've enough on, trying to make a
luncheon that looks worth eating.

30:01.176 --> 30:04.429
But that's what I'm saying.
Everything's in short supply now.

30:04.471 --> 30:07.349
Short supply? No supply, more like!

30:08.600 --> 30:11.645
Talk about making a silk purse
out of a sow's ear.

30:11.687 --> 30:15.524
I wish we had a sow's ear!
It'd be better than this brisket.

30:16.859 --> 30:20.279
That's just it. Thomas has come by
some groceries and such

30:20.320 --> 30:23.323
and he's prepared to let them go
for the right price.

30:23.365 --> 30:25.659
He's prepared to let them go,
is he?

30:25.701 --> 30:28.704
And how did he come by them?
That's what I'd like to know.

30:28.745 --> 30:31.415
Well, they're not stolen,
in case you're worried.

30:31.456 --> 30:34.835
I'm not worried.
You're the one who should be worried.

30:37.129 --> 30:41.758
Tell you what. I'm making
a wedding cake now, for Mr Crawley.

30:41.800 --> 30:44.428
I'll finish it early
and feed it with brandy.

30:44.469 --> 30:47.389
So if I give you a list of
ingredients, can you get them?

30:47.431 --> 30:49.516
I can. And then we'll see.

30:49.558 --> 30:53.103
Now will you leave me and let me
get on with this travesty?

31:04.531 --> 31:06.617
Why are you here?

31:13.916 --> 31:16.752
Mr Bryant, Mrs Bryant, welcome.

31:16.793 --> 31:18.795
We're so pleased to be here.

31:18.837 --> 31:21.381
This is so kind of you,
Lady Grantham.

31:21.423 --> 31:24.218
It is, but we ought to make it clear
we can't stay long.

31:24.259 --> 31:26.595
I wasn't sure we had time to come
at all.

31:26.637 --> 31:28.555
Luncheon is quite ready.

31:28.597 --> 31:31.642
We must eat and run, I'm afraid.
We have to be at Maryport by six.

31:31.683 --> 31:34.853
We're all so terribly sorry about
the reason you're here.

31:34.895 --> 31:38.357
If we could see Charles's room.
Shall I take Mrs Bryant up?

31:38.398 --> 31:40.901
No, I'll do it.
We'll all do it.

31:40.943 --> 31:43.862
My cousin, Mrs Crawley,
who looked after Major Bryant,

31:43.904 --> 31:47.324
and my daughters who nursed him,
will join us. How thoughtful.

31:47.366 --> 31:50.869
But we can't be long. I've told our
chauffeur to stay in the car.

31:50.911 --> 31:54.581
Will I take him something to eat?
Leave him be. He's quite happy.

31:54.623 --> 31:58.460
Please, come and see where Major
Bryant lived while he was with us.

32:03.006 --> 32:06.134
I'm afraid it's not going to work.
Why?

32:06.176 --> 32:08.261
They're in the dining
room and getting

32:08.262 --> 32:10.389
straight into the car
when they've finished.

32:10.430 --> 32:14.184
I tried to speak to her on my own but
there was never the right moment.

32:14.226 --> 32:16.770
Your grandaddy is a bit of a bully.

32:16.812 --> 32:19.231
But I must see them.
I've come all this way.

32:19.273 --> 32:21.358
Of course it's a disappointment.

32:21.400 --> 32:25.404
You said yourself there wouldn't be
another chance. We can't know that.

32:25.445 --> 32:27.948
Maybe you should write to them
after all.

32:29.449 --> 32:34.413
You've nothing to lose. No. They have
to see him. They must see Charlie.

32:34.454 --> 32:38.458
Well, maybe they will...
sometime in the future.

32:39.501 --> 32:41.587
I hope so.

32:41.628 --> 32:43.714
You'd better go now.

32:49.845 --> 32:52.389
This wedding cake... Can I make it?

32:52.431 --> 32:54.766
You wouldn't know how to start.

32:54.808 --> 32:56.768
But you can tell me.

32:56.810 --> 33:00.105
And if I make it early, then you can
make another if it's no good.

33:00.147 --> 33:04.151
If I say yes,
will you do as you're told?

33:04.193 --> 33:06.904
Daisy, there's a wretched chauffeur
at the front

33:06.945 --> 33:09.031
who's not allowed
to get out of the car,

33:09.072 --> 33:12.034
so can you make him a sandwich and
take him up a bottle of pop?

33:12.075 --> 33:15.204
We've some ham and... My God.

33:17.831 --> 33:19.958
Who was that?
Wasn't that Ethel?

33:20.000 --> 33:22.336
Did you see what she was carrying?
No.

33:23.670 --> 33:26.131
Then just... let's leave it at that.

33:26.173 --> 33:30.177
I'm afraid Downton will be
a place of pilgrimage for a while.

33:30.219 --> 33:34.890
We're glad to be. If we can help
to bring some peace of mind.

33:34.932 --> 33:38.018
There's no point in wallowing in it.
What good does it do?

33:38.060 --> 33:40.145
Leave me alone. Ethel!

33:41.688 --> 33:43.482
I tried to stop her.
What on earth?

33:43.524 --> 33:45.234
Ethel... I know what this is.

33:45.275 --> 33:48.570
Mrs Hughes, I don't think
it's quite the right - I'm stopping.

33:48.612 --> 33:50.697
Until I've had my say.

33:51.532 --> 33:54.243
This is Charlie. Your grandson.

33:55.202 --> 33:57.287
He's almost a year old.

34:01.583 --> 34:03.669
What proof have you?

34:04.670 --> 34:06.839
What?
I say, what proof have you?

34:06.880 --> 34:09.716
If my son was the father of this boy,
where is your proof?

34:09.757 --> 34:11.885
Have you any letters?
Any signed statement?

34:11.927 --> 34:14.471
Why would there be letters?
We were in the same house.

34:14.513 --> 34:18.058
I think she's telling the truth.
I'm not interested in 'think'.

34:18.100 --> 34:21.018
I want proof that my son
acknowledged paternity of this boy.

34:21.061 --> 34:23.772
If what you say is true,
then he would have known

34:23.813 --> 34:26.483
of the boy's existence
for months before he...

34:27.775 --> 34:29.862
before he was killed.

34:31.780 --> 34:33.782
Yes. He knew.

34:33.824 --> 34:37.411
So... What did he do about it?

34:39.246 --> 34:41.331
Nothing.

34:41.373 --> 34:43.667
He did nothing. Thank you.

34:43.708 --> 34:46.043
That's the proof I was looking for.

34:46.085 --> 34:48.213
If Charles was the
father, he would never

34:48.255 --> 34:50.340
have shirked his responsibilities.
Never.

34:50.382 --> 34:52.717
Well, he did.
I won't listen to any more slander!

34:52.759 --> 34:55.888
Now will you please go, and take
that boy with you, whoever he is.

34:55.929 --> 34:58.265
You are upsetting Mrs Bryant.
I would like...

34:58.307 --> 35:01.143
I say you are upsetting Mrs Bryant.

35:01.185 --> 35:05.189
Lord Grantham, are you going to stand
by while this woman holds us to ransom?

35:05.230 --> 35:08.609
This isn't doing much good.
Ethel, you'd better come with me.

35:08.650 --> 35:10.736
Come on.

35:18.368 --> 35:20.454
She thinks we're a soft touch.

35:20.495 --> 35:22.915
They hear of a dead officer with
money behind them

35:22.998 --> 35:25.250
and suddenly there's a baby
on every corner.

35:25.292 --> 35:26.877
But if she's telling the truth...

35:26.919 --> 35:30.088
If Charles had fathered that boy,
he would have told us.

35:30.130 --> 35:34.009
Now, I'd say she's done her homework
and discovered he was an only child.

35:34.051 --> 35:37.262
She thinks we'd be ripe
for the plucking.

35:41.892 --> 35:45.812
You knew her. Was she one of the
nurses when he was here?

35:45.854 --> 35:47.940
She was a housemaid.

35:50.984 --> 35:52.778
Were you aware? No.

35:52.819 --> 35:55.572
No-one told me Major Bryant
was your only son.

35:55.614 --> 35:58.325
That's right. Just Charles.

35:59.368 --> 36:02.746
Matthew is my only son,
and he nearly died.

36:03.914 --> 36:07.209
I think I know what you're going
through. He seems such a nice...

36:07.251 --> 36:10.128
I think that's cast rather a
shadow over the proceedings,

36:10.170 --> 36:12.965
so I don't see any point
in prolonging it.

36:13.590 --> 36:15.676
Daphne, come on, we're leaving.

36:17.761 --> 36:22.307
He's afraid of his own grief.
That's why he behaves as he does.

36:22.349 --> 36:24.768
He's terrified of his own grief.

36:35.904 --> 36:39.324
If that's what he's like, I don't
want his help. I don't want it.

36:39.366 --> 36:43.203
I doubt you'll have the option.
You're a dark horse.

36:43.996 --> 36:46.248
How did you keep it a secret
all this time?

36:46.290 --> 36:50.669
Maybe when he's thought about it he'll
feel differently, you never know.

36:52.212 --> 36:55.841
Anna... will you kindly go upstairs
and help in the dining room?

36:55.883 --> 36:58.760
Ethel, please take the child
and leave.

36:59.720 --> 37:03.390
How did you get here? I caught the
bus and walked up from the village.

37:03.432 --> 37:06.143
Then can you reverse the process
as quickly as possible?

37:06.226 --> 37:09.688
She's very badly shaken, Mr Carson.
She's lost everything.

37:09.730 --> 37:12.399
Are you all right for the fare?
Yes, thank you.

37:18.113 --> 37:21.491
He's their only grandchild.
There can never be another.

37:21.533 --> 37:25.204
Even if Ethel is telling the truth.
I believe she is.

37:25.245 --> 37:28.540
Even so, there's no legal reality
to it.

37:28.582 --> 37:31.543
The child is her bastard
and has no claim on them.

37:31.585 --> 37:35.005
Steady on, sir. The ladies have had
enough shocks for one day.

37:35.047 --> 37:38.926
I just don't see the point in pretending
something can be done when it can't.

37:38.967 --> 37:42.763
What about you, Mother? Can't one of
your refugee charities help?

37:42.804 --> 37:46.683
She's not a refugee and we have more
claims on our funding than we can meet.

37:46.725 --> 37:50.312
The truth is, Ethel's made her choice
and now she's stuck with it.

37:50.354 --> 37:53.941
That seems a little hard.
Does it?

37:53.982 --> 37:56.652
Aren't all of us stuck with
the choices we make?

38:03.825 --> 38:07.287
Candied peel? Well, well. I never
thought you'd find that.

38:07.329 --> 38:09.705
I hope you're pleased, Mrs Patmore.

38:09.706 --> 38:11.834
Course she is. Aren't you?
There's stuff

38:11.875 --> 38:14.002
here we haven't seen
since before the war.

38:14.044 --> 38:15.921
I can't wait to get started.

38:15.963 --> 38:19.049
I won't ask where you got it from,
because I don't want to know.

38:19.091 --> 38:22.594
I keep saying. There's nothing
wrong. So what I'd like to know is...

38:22.636 --> 38:25.597
When will he get paid?
When I'm satisfied.

38:26.431 --> 38:28.642
And when will that be, oh mighty one?

38:28.684 --> 38:31.937
When Daisy's baked the cake
and I'm pleased with it.

38:32.855 --> 38:34.439
He understands.

38:34.481 --> 38:37.609
He knows this is just the sprat
to catch the mackerel.

38:41.446 --> 38:43.615
I really ought to walk
to the library.

38:43.657 --> 38:47.035
No need to rush it, sir.
You're getting better every day.

38:53.750 --> 38:57.087
Cousin, Matthew? May I come in?
Please.

38:57.129 --> 39:00.215
No, no, no. No stay where you are.
Thank you.

39:01.758 --> 39:04.595
No doubt you will regard this as
rather unorthodox,

39:04.636 --> 39:07.514
my pushing into a man's bedroom,
uninvited.

39:07.556 --> 39:11.226
Well, erm... It's just I don't
want us to be disturbed.

39:13.687 --> 39:17.816
I'm sure you know how pleased I am
that you will recover, after all.

39:17.858 --> 39:19.985
Thank you.

39:20.027 --> 39:24.072
Just as I am delighted that you can
once more look forward to a...

39:25.449 --> 39:27.784
to a happy married life.

39:27.826 --> 39:29.912
I'm very lucky.

39:29.953 --> 39:33.373
Now this may come as a surprise...

39:34.708 --> 39:37.419
but I feel I must say it
all the same. Please do.

39:37.461 --> 39:40.964
Mary is still in love with you.
What?

39:42.508 --> 39:46.303
I was watching her the other night
when you spoke of your wedding.

39:47.513 --> 39:52.226
She looked like...
Juliet, on awakening in the tomb.

39:52.267 --> 39:55.687
Mary and I have always had -
Of course, I suspected long ago

39:55.729 --> 39:58.440
that the flame hadn't quite gone out,

39:58.482 --> 40:01.527
but then there was no chance
of your recovery.

40:01.568 --> 40:05.948
And it seemed best to let her try
for happiness where she could.

40:05.989 --> 40:08.367
I quite agree, and Sir Richard is...

40:08.408 --> 40:12.746
No, now, let's not muddy the pool
by discussing Sir Richard.

40:14.122 --> 40:16.542
The point is, you loved her once.

40:17.960 --> 40:20.170
Are you sure you can't love her
again?

40:23.131 --> 40:25.217
Cousin Violet...

40:25.259 --> 40:28.720
Please don't think I mind your...
speaking to me in this way.

40:28.762 --> 40:32.182
I quite admire it but...
consider this.

40:33.350 --> 40:35.853
Lavinia came back against
my orders, determined

40:35.894 --> 40:38.313
to look after me for
the rest of my life,

40:38.355 --> 40:42.359
which meant that she would wash me
and feed me and...

40:42.401 --> 40:46.530
do things that only the most
dedicated nurse would undertake.

40:46.572 --> 40:49.616
And all with no hope of children
or any improvement.

40:49.658 --> 40:55.539
Yes, it's all very admirable...
and I give her full credit.

40:55.622 --> 40:59.084
And giving her that credit, do you
think it would be right for me

40:59.126 --> 41:01.752
to throw her over
because I can walk?

41:01.753 --> 41:06.049
To dismiss her, because I no longer
have need of her services?

41:06.091 --> 41:08.510
Spoken like a man of honor.

41:10.095 --> 41:12.472
And we will not fall out over this.

41:14.474 --> 41:16.560
But you don't agree.

41:16.602 --> 41:18.687
I would just say one thing:

41:19.855 --> 41:23.275
Marriage is a long business.

41:24.860 --> 41:27.988
There's no getting out of it
for our kind of people.

41:28.030 --> 41:33.869
Now you may live 40... 50 years
with one of these two women.

41:35.871 --> 41:38.665
Just make sure you have selected
the right one.

41:42.628 --> 41:45.005
Will it be April or May?

41:45.047 --> 41:48.842
I should steer clear of May.
Marry in May, rue the day.

41:48.884 --> 41:53.096
I think it's April. Matthew should
be walking normally by them.

41:53.138 --> 41:55.641
Spring weddings are the prettiest
of all.

41:55.682 --> 41:59.269
All this talk of weddings
is making me impatient.

42:00.687 --> 42:04.608
I don't think we can go into competition
with Matthew and Lavinia, do you?

42:05.150 --> 42:09.321
After then. In the summer. Let's
settle it before I return to London.

42:10.572 --> 42:13.450
You must be looking forward to
traveling again.

42:13.492 --> 42:15.577
I know I am.

42:15.619 --> 42:17.704
Very well. The end of July.

42:17.746 --> 42:20.832
Then we can be out of England
for August.

42:22.251 --> 42:24.044
You don't sound very excited.

42:24.086 --> 42:26.630
To quote you 'that's not who we are. '

42:29.758 --> 42:33.053
There's something I've been meaning
to ask you. Here's the hero.

42:33.136 --> 42:34.596
Here we are.

42:34.680 --> 42:36.765
Why did you try to bribe Anna?

42:39.893 --> 42:43.480
She told you, did she?
She didn't. Not me.

42:44.773 --> 42:46.859
But why did you do it?

42:47.818 --> 42:50.696
Next time, if you want to know
anything, just ask me.

42:52.239 --> 42:55.367
Well done. Very well done.

42:57.494 --> 42:59.955
All right then I will.
Once and for all, are

42:59.997 --> 43:02.416
you still in love
with Matthew Crawley?

43:02.457 --> 43:04.543
Of course not!

43:04.585 --> 43:08.505
Would I ever admit to loving a man
who preferred someone else over me?

43:14.845 --> 43:17.222
Where's Sybil?
She's not feeling well.

43:17.264 --> 43:20.184
She told Anna she wouldn't be down
for dinner.

43:24.646 --> 43:27.232
What is it?
I heard from my lawyer today.

43:28.150 --> 43:31.402
Apparently, Vera wrote to a friend
just before my last visit.

43:31.403 --> 43:34.907
Why are they telling you now? It was
only delivered a few days ago.

43:34.948 --> 43:38.702
And do you know what the letter
says? They sent me a copy.

43:46.376 --> 43:48.629
'John has written and he's coming
here tonight.

43:48.712 --> 43:51.381
His words sound as angry as
I've ever heard him,

43:51.423 --> 43:53.509
and you know how angry that is.

43:53.550 --> 43:56.887
I never thought I'd say this,
but I'm afraid for my life. '

43:59.556 --> 44:01.642
What did you write to her?

44:05.729 --> 44:09.274
I said I was coming that evening and
I meant to have it out with her.

44:09.316 --> 44:12.611
I may have said she was being
unreasonable, but so she was.

44:13.362 --> 44:15.739
Will it change anything?
Think about it.

44:16.949 --> 44:19.535
Before Vera's death,
she had taken all my money

44:19.576 --> 44:22.538
and she had wrecked the divorce.
Now, as her widower,

44:22.621 --> 44:25.832
I inherit everything and we can marry
whenever we like.

44:27.668 --> 44:29.753
Anna, they're going in.

44:35.509 --> 44:39.221
You look as if you've got the cares
of the world on your shoulders.

44:40.138 --> 44:43.475
Not the whole world, Mrs Hughes,
but quite enough of it.

44:51.316 --> 44:53.402
Sybil?

44:56.738 --> 44:58.824
Sybil I just want to say goodnight.

45:06.957 --> 45:11.170
Mrs Hughes, can I borrow the
duplicate keys for upstairs?

45:11.211 --> 45:15.799
Why? Lady Mary says one of the
bathroom keys isn't working.

45:15.841 --> 45:17.885
She thinks it must have got swapped.

45:17.926 --> 45:20.429
I'll come.

45:20.470 --> 45:24.016
No, no there's no need.
I'll bring them back in a jiffy.

45:24.057 --> 45:26.143
You've done enough for one day.

45:50.667 --> 45:52.753
My God. She's eloped.

45:52.794 --> 45:55.255
She's on her way to Gretna Green.

46:03.514 --> 46:06.558
They must stop at some point.
It won't be open before morning.

46:06.600 --> 46:09.019
They won't expect us to
follow until tomorrow.

46:09.061 --> 46:11.438
They'll stay somewhere on the road.
We hope.

46:11.480 --> 46:13.774
Everyone keep an eye out
for the motor.

46:27.913 --> 46:31.708
Daisy? What in God's name are you
doing down here at this hour?

46:31.750 --> 46:34.002
I just wanted to check
it were all right.

46:34.044 --> 46:37.172
That it hadn't, you know,
caved in or anything. Caved in?

46:37.214 --> 46:39.842
It's a cake, not a souffle.

46:39.883 --> 46:42.594
I know. But I've never made
a wedding cake before.

46:42.636 --> 46:45.889
Is that the one for tasting?
Yes, Mrs Patmore.

46:45.931 --> 46:48.225
Well, bring it out.
We'll give it a try.

47:00.737 --> 47:03.866
What in God's name
do you call this?

47:03.907 --> 47:06.869
I don't know. I did everything
that you said. I promise.

47:06.910 --> 47:08.996
But didn't you taste the mixture?

47:11.081 --> 47:14.918
Well, then I'm afraid it's time
to look at Thomas's ingredients.

47:19.089 --> 47:23.135
Well, it's two thirds plaster dust.
Where's the peel?

47:31.018 --> 47:34.021
Yuk! This were old
when Adam were a boy.

47:35.772 --> 47:39.234
So, Thomas was happy to 'let it go',
was he?

47:39.276 --> 47:42.196
Well, it won't go anywhere near me
in future!

47:42.237 --> 47:45.699
Chuck the whole bally lot out
and we'll have to think again.

47:52.873 --> 47:54.958
Isn't that the car?

48:06.845 --> 48:09.473
How did you find us?
How did you know?

48:09.515 --> 48:12.309
Never mind that. At least nothing's
happened, thank God.

48:12.351 --> 48:14.394
What do you mean nothing's happened?

48:14.436 --> 48:17.814
I've decided to marry Tom and your
coming after me won't change that.

48:17.856 --> 48:19.900
This isn't the way.
She's right.

48:19.942 --> 48:22.569
Of course Mama and Papa will hate it.
Why should they?

48:22.611 --> 48:24.571
Pipe down.

48:24.613 --> 48:27.282
Sybil, can't you let them
get used to the idea?

48:27.324 --> 48:30.452
Take your stand and refuse to budge,
but allow them time.

48:30.494 --> 48:32.871
That way, you won't have to break up
the family.

48:32.913 --> 48:36.959
They would never give permission.
You don't need permission. You're 21.

48:37.000 --> 48:39.378
But you do need their
forgiveness if you're not

48:39.419 --> 48:41.755
to start your new life
under a black shadow.

48:41.797 --> 48:45.008
Don't listen. She's pretending
to be reasonable to get you home.

48:45.050 --> 48:47.219
Even if I am,
even if I think this is mad,

48:47.261 --> 48:49.972
I know it will be better to do it
in broad daylight

48:50.013 --> 48:52.683
than to sneak off
like a thief in the night.

49:01.400 --> 49:03.485
Go back with them, then.

49:03.527 --> 49:06.363
If you think they can make you
happier than I will.

49:08.115 --> 49:10.534
Am I so weak you believe
I can be talked out

49:10.576 --> 49:12.911
of giving my heart in
five minutes flat?

49:15.163 --> 49:19.751
But Mary's right. I don't like deceit
and our parents don't deserve it.

49:21.336 --> 49:23.422
So I'll go back with them.

49:25.757 --> 49:28.177
Believe it or not,
I will stay true to you.

49:48.989 --> 49:51.074
I'll return the car in the morning.

49:52.367 --> 49:56.330
You're confident you can bring her
round, aren't you? Fairly.

49:56.371 --> 49:58.457
I'll certainly try.

49:59.750 --> 50:01.835
Do you want some money? For the room?

50:03.128 --> 50:06.507
No thank you, m'lady.
I can pay my own way.

50:16.058 --> 50:18.143
Where are the girls?

50:18.185 --> 50:21.939
I suppose Sybil's still ill and
the others just haven't appeared.

50:22.814 --> 50:25.442
I hope they're not coming down
with anything.

50:25.484 --> 50:28.153
The stories of this Spanish 'flu
are too awful.

50:28.195 --> 50:31.240
No, it's nothing of the sort.
Why are you up so early?

50:31.281 --> 50:34.326
I'm meeting Isobel. She wants me to
help with her refugees.

50:34.368 --> 50:36.703
I thought the whole
point of Mama arranging

50:36.745 --> 50:39.039
that was to keep her out of your hair.
I know.

50:39.081 --> 50:41.542
But now the soldiers have
gone, I do have a lot

50:41.583 --> 50:44.002
of time on my hands and
maybe I can be useful.

50:44.711 --> 50:47.005
Why is it different from before the
war?

50:47.047 --> 50:49.508
I don't know exactly. It just is.

50:49.550 --> 50:51.635
Maybe the war's changed me.

50:51.677 --> 50:54.137
I guess it's changed everybody.

50:55.347 --> 50:58.267
Not me. Don't be too sure.

51:01.645 --> 51:04.231
If I'm not back before luncheon,
don't wait.

51:05.065 --> 51:07.609
I'll take this down to keep it hot,
m'lord.

51:21.665 --> 51:23.750
I wanted to catch you alone.

51:31.133 --> 51:35.971
Yes... You see, I think you might be
happier if I tended my resignation.

51:36.013 --> 51:39.600
What? I'd hate you to be
uncomfortable in your own house...

51:39.641 --> 51:42.144
I won't hear of it.
But I know...

51:42.186 --> 51:44.354
You will not be deprived
of your livelihood

51:44.396 --> 51:46.481
because I behaved in an
ungentlemanly manner.

51:46.523 --> 51:49.776
The fault was entirely mine.
You will not pay the price.

53:03.809 --> 53:07.437
Is this yours? Moseley found it
in your dressing room.

53:08.438 --> 53:11.900
It's not one of your old toys, is it?
Because I don't recognize it.

53:11.942 --> 53:15.404
No. It was given to me. As a charm,
I think. To take to the front.

53:15.445 --> 53:17.656
Well, you're home and safe now.

53:17.698 --> 53:20.826
Shall I put it in the barrel
for the village children? No.

53:23.954 --> 53:26.874
You never know.
It might be bad luck not to keep it.

53:28.792 --> 53:30.878
Luncheon will be ready soon.

53:36.175 --> 53:39.428
It's all rubbish.
It's all bloody rubbish!

53:39.469 --> 53:41.430
Can't you ask for your money back?

53:41.471 --> 53:44.725
Yes. Of course I can ask.
And a fat lot of good that'll do!

53:44.766 --> 53:46.727
You must challenge him. How?

53:46.768 --> 53:50.230
I only ever met him in a pub.
I wouldn't know where to find him.

53:50.272 --> 53:52.691
But surely -
Don't you understand, woman?!

53:54.318 --> 53:56.403
I've been tricked!

53:57.237 --> 53:59.323
I've been had!

54:00.532 --> 54:02.743
I've been taken for the fool
that I am!

54:15.380 --> 54:17.466
How much did he get from you?

54:19.343 --> 54:21.428
Every penny I had.

54:23.222 --> 54:25.307
And then some.

54:28.477 --> 54:30.562
What are you going to do now?

54:32.356 --> 54:34.441
I don't know.

54:35.776 --> 54:37.861
I don't bloody know.
