01:03.197 --> 01:05.864
Do you want to join
my pirate crew?

01:07.267 --> 01:08.267
Great!

01:08.269 --> 01:09.968
To start
today's adventure,

01:09.970 --> 01:12.704
everybody say
the Pirate Password.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.606
Yo-ho-ho!

01:14.608 --> 01:16.575
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:16.577 --> 01:17.843
One more time.

01:17.845 --> 01:19.678
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:23.349 --> 01:26.151
[Jake] Hook and
the Itty-Bitty Kitty.

01:27.020 --> 01:28.253
[Hook] Are we there yet, Smee?

01:28.255 --> 01:30.155
Are we there yet?!

01:30.157 --> 01:34.359
We're ten seconds closer
than the last time
you asked, Cap'n!

01:34.361 --> 01:36.361
[stammers] I'm just
so thrilled, Smee!

01:36.363 --> 01:40.332
Red Jessica asked me
to come see her!

01:40.334 --> 01:42.301
Land ho!

01:42.303 --> 01:45.237
Crimson Isle dead ahead!

01:45.239 --> 01:48.640
Why, Smee, that means...

01:48.642 --> 01:51.710
Aye, Cap'n, we're finally there!

01:53.046 --> 01:56.248
My dearest, Red Jessica!

01:56.250 --> 01:59.818
Ahoy, James!
You made excellent time.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.687
But of course, m'lady!

02:01.689 --> 02:05.357
As you know,
I am at your command!

02:05.359 --> 02:08.393
I was hoping
you'd say that. Here.

02:08.395 --> 02:10.829
- What's this?
- Meow!

02:10.831 --> 02:14.399
- Oh!
- Me itty-bitty kitty,
Rosie.

02:14.401 --> 02:16.735
- Kitty?
- Meow.

02:16.737 --> 02:20.739
I must sail today and
the poor dear hates water.

02:20.741 --> 02:23.976
You don't mind
watching her
till I return?

02:23.978 --> 02:27.946
Sail? Return?
Why, no, but I...

02:27.948 --> 02:31.416
Fabulous! I knew I could
count on you, James!

02:31.418 --> 02:33.318
Hup!

02:33.320 --> 02:36.321
Keep my sweetums safe
till my return!

02:36.323 --> 02:40.392
Ta-ta, Rosie-wosie!
Mommy shall return!

02:40.394 --> 02:41.960
Meow?

02:41.962 --> 02:45.063
Oh, what an adorable
little kitty, eh, sir?

02:45.065 --> 02:49.334
There is no such thing
as an adorable cat!

02:49.336 --> 02:52.437
- Here!
- Oh! Whoopsie!

02:52.439 --> 02:55.107
Oh, dear, Cap'n,
the cat's loose!

02:55.109 --> 02:58.977
[stammers] Don't just stand
there! Catch that scurvy feline!

02:58.979 --> 03:00.012
Catching, Cap'n!

03:03.249 --> 03:05.951
<i>¶ Swinging in the rigging</i>
<i>Running round ¶</i>

03:05.953 --> 03:08.420
<i>¶ Hurry up mates</i>
<i>Let's chase her down ¶</i>

<i>¶ Like a frisky</i>
<i>fuzzy cannonball ¶</i>

<i>¶ She's a runaway kitty</i>
<i>Meow-meow ¶</i>

03:17.798 --> 03:20.399
<i>¶ She's a runaway kitty</i>
<i>Chase her down ¶</i>

03:20.401 --> 03:23.435
<i>¶ She's a runaway kitty</i>
<i>Meow-meow-meow ¶</i>

03:24.837 --> 03:26.338
Steady as she goes, Cubby!

03:26.340 --> 03:28.040
Aye-aye, Jake!

03:28.042 --> 03:32.844
Way-hey, mateys, what's
happening over on Crimson Isle?

03:32.846 --> 03:34.980
[Jake] It's the <i>Jolly Roger.</i>

03:34.982 --> 03:38.283
But something really
weird is going on!

03:38.285 --> 03:40.385
Captain Hook might
need our help.

03:40.387 --> 03:43.121
Bucky, full speed
to Crimson Isle!

03:45.425 --> 03:47.426
Capture it, Smee!

03:47.428 --> 03:49.261
[Smee] Almost had her, sir!

03:49.263 --> 03:51.797
Fast as furry lightning
she is!

03:51.799 --> 03:53.398
Ahoy, Captain Hook!

03:53.400 --> 03:55.234
What seems to be the trouble!?

03:55.236 --> 03:58.070
Nothing I can't
handle on me own!

03:58.072 --> 04:00.005
- [screeches]
- Ahh! Ooh!

04:07.380 --> 04:08.347
[meows]

04:08.349 --> 04:10.048
Blast!

04:10.050 --> 04:12.117
Where'd that kitty come from?

04:12.119 --> 04:14.786
That kitty belongs
to Red Jessica.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.755
The Cap'n agreed
to watch her!

04:16.757 --> 04:20.459
And I did watch her,
run away!

04:20.461 --> 04:22.261
Look alive, you swabs.

04:22.263 --> 04:24.763
We must catch that kitty.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.399
We'd be glad to help you get
the cat back, Captain Hook!

04:27.401 --> 04:31.937
Mateys, will you help us
catch Red Jessica's cat
for Captain Hook?

04:33.339 --> 04:36.908
Great! Let's all keep
a lookout for gold doubloons.

04:36.910 --> 04:40.412
Whenever we solve
a pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

04:40.414 --> 04:44.016
Then we'll collect 'em
and put' em in our
Team Treasure Chest.

04:44.018 --> 04:46.084
Is everybody ready?

04:46.086 --> 04:47.319
I got my sword!

04:47.321 --> 04:48.553
I got my map!

04:48.555 --> 04:50.922
And I've got
my pixie dust!

04:50.924 --> 04:54.293
The fairies gave it to me so
that we can use it to fly!

04:54.295 --> 04:56.428
But only in emergencies!

04:56.430 --> 04:58.797
Yo-ho, let's go!

05:02.969 --> 05:06.004
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away! </i>

05:06.006 --> 05:08.307
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

05:08.309 --> 05:13.278
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

05:13.280 --> 05:16.148
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

05:16.150 --> 05:17.983
<i>¶ And me </i>

05:21.087 --> 05:25.290
Ohh. Where did that
fleeing feline go?

05:25.292 --> 05:26.825
[Skully] Fear not, Hook!

05:26.827 --> 05:30.529
Kitty-cat's heading
toward Crimson Isle Gorge!

05:33.333 --> 05:35.434
Whoa! Hold up, mateys!

05:35.436 --> 05:37.569
Look! There's Rosie!

05:37.571 --> 05:39.404
Out in the middle
of the zip-line!

05:39.406 --> 05:40.972
[meows]

05:40.974 --> 05:44.309
Grab her, you bumbling
buccaneers!

05:44.311 --> 05:46.378
- [all shouting]
- Oh, dear!

05:46.380 --> 05:49.481
- Here, kitty-kitty!
- We're comin' to getcha!

05:49.483 --> 05:52.117
- [meowing]
- [men grunting]

05:52.119 --> 05:55.020
- [thudding]
- [men groaning]

05:55.022 --> 05:56.922
Aw, coconuts!

05:56.924 --> 06:00.225
How can we cross the gorge
and catch Rosie now?

06:00.227 --> 06:01.593
I have an idea.

06:01.595 --> 06:05.597
Hey, Captain Hook,
nice hook you've got there!

06:06.866 --> 06:11.103
Jake! This is highly unusual!

06:11.105 --> 06:13.605
Ready, everyone? Jump!

06:14.540 --> 06:16.174
Jump?

06:17.977 --> 06:20.579
Yo-ho, we made it
across the gorge

06:20.581 --> 06:23.048
and got two
gold doubloons.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.584
Let's grab 'em
and go find that cat!

06:26.352 --> 06:28.186
[far away meow]

06:28.188 --> 06:32.391
Why, look! Kitty's sneaking off
toward Big Rock River!

06:33.593 --> 06:35.527
[meowing]

06:37.096 --> 06:39.164
You foul feline!

06:39.166 --> 06:42.401
I, Captain Hook,
command you

06:42.403 --> 06:46.438
to return to me
immediately!

06:46.440 --> 06:48.273
[meowing]

06:48.275 --> 06:51.009
Tah! I'll show her.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.145
Men! Follow me!

06:55.248 --> 06:57.215
[all shouting]]

07:00.119 --> 07:02.521
Captain Hook, hook my sword!

07:02.523 --> 07:05.257
Cantankerous cat!

07:05.259 --> 07:08.026
Is there no place
she cannot go!?

07:08.028 --> 07:13.432
Oh, those rocks are
too narrow and slippery
for us pirates, I'm afraid!

07:13.434 --> 07:16.435
I got it! Let's push 'em over
like dominoes

07:16.437 --> 07:18.503
so they'll make a bridge!

07:18.505 --> 07:21.406
Come on! Everybody, push!

07:21.408 --> 07:23.475
[all grunting]

07:25.344 --> 07:27.546
Yeah! Let's go!

07:27.548 --> 07:29.448
Whoo-hoo!

07:29.450 --> 07:31.349
We did it!

07:31.351 --> 07:33.385
We crossed Big Rock River

07:33.387 --> 07:36.254
and we got two more
gold doubloons!

07:36.256 --> 07:39.324
Let's grab 'em,
and go grab that cat!

07:39.725 --> 07:41.460
[gasps] Look!

07:41.462 --> 07:44.362
Footprints!
She went this way!

07:44.364 --> 07:46.398
Yo-ho, let's go!

07:46.400 --> 07:50.402
The footprints lead
into this canyon!

07:50.404 --> 07:52.637
And there's no way out!

07:52.639 --> 07:56.208
I've finally got
that feline cornered!

07:56.210 --> 07:58.343
She can't get away
from me now!

07:58.345 --> 08:00.645
What seems to be the hold-up?

08:00.647 --> 08:05.217
The cat prints in the mud
are suddenly... bigger.

08:05.219 --> 08:07.419
Much bigger.

08:07.421 --> 08:12.424
Oh, dear.
[stammers] Mightn't that be why?

08:12.426 --> 08:13.692
- [purring]
- [snores]

08:13.694 --> 08:18.630
[all stammering]
Tiger! Abandon ship!

08:18.632 --> 08:20.765
Fie and fish sticks!

08:20.767 --> 08:23.368
That poor itty-bitty kitty

08:23.370 --> 08:26.571
doesn't know it's in terrible,
terrible danger!

08:30.142 --> 08:31.009
[all] Huh!?

08:31.011 --> 08:34.045
Here, kitty-kitty.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.448
Come on, Rosie-wosie!

08:36.450 --> 08:38.583
Hooky-wookie will save you!

08:38.585 --> 08:40.252
Meow.

08:40.254 --> 08:42.420
[purring]

08:42.422 --> 08:46.458
Who's a good girl?
Rosie's a good girl!

08:46.460 --> 08:49.661
I guess the kitty finally
got to you, huh, Captain Hook?

08:49.663 --> 08:51.396
You like her!

08:51.398 --> 08:53.198
Perhaps a wee bit,

08:53.200 --> 08:57.636
but after all, just look
at that sweet little face!

08:57.638 --> 08:59.538
Meow!

08:59.540 --> 09:01.506
[Smee] Ship ho!

09:01.508 --> 09:04.376
It looks like Red Jessica's
ship, Cap'n!

09:04.378 --> 09:06.478
She's sailin' back home!

09:06.480 --> 09:08.813
Oh, we must greet m'lady!

09:08.815 --> 09:12.517
I'm certain she's missed
her itty-bitty kitty.

09:12.519 --> 09:17.422
Izzy! Sprinkle us with
magic dusty stuff so we
can fly to her!

09:17.424 --> 09:20.458
Sorry, Captain Hook,
Pixie Dust is only

09:20.460 --> 09:23.528
- for emergencies.
- [tiger roars]

09:27.166 --> 09:29.267
[nervous laugh]

09:29.269 --> 09:33.204
Would this qualify as one
of those "emergencies"?

09:33.206 --> 09:36.608
Way ahead of you.
Pixie dust away!

09:39.579 --> 09:41.313
Meow.

09:41.315 --> 09:43.515
Don't worry, Rosie-wosie,

09:43.517 --> 09:46.484
Captain Hooky-wookie
will keep you safe!

09:51.357 --> 09:53.625
There you are, Sweetie Kitty,

09:53.627 --> 09:55.460
safe and sound!

09:55.462 --> 09:58.530
Mommy should be dropping
anchor any minute now!

09:58.532 --> 10:01.700
Well, Captain Hook.
I'm glad we could help you out.

10:01.702 --> 10:04.536
Thank you, popinjays!

10:04.538 --> 10:08.607
I suppose you did
help in some small way!

10:08.609 --> 10:09.741
Meow!

10:09.743 --> 10:12.110
[all] So long, Rosie!

10:12.112 --> 10:16.648
Yo-ho, mateys, we safely
returned Rosie to Captain Hook,

10:16.650 --> 10:19.484
And we got three more
gold doubloons!

10:19.486 --> 10:22.721
Let's grab 'em and
go back to Pirate Island!

10:25.424 --> 10:30.228
Yo-ho, way to go, mateys!
Thanks for helping return Rosie!

10:30.230 --> 10:32.464
Now, let's put
all our gold doubloons

10:32.466 --> 10:34.566
into our Team Treasure Chest.

10:41.774 --> 10:43.808
<i>¶ Way hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

10:43.810 --> 10:45.910
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

10:45.912 --> 10:48.213
<i>¶ Way hey</i>
<i>with help from you ¶</i>

10:48.215 --> 10:50.849
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

10:50.851 --> 10:53.451
Come on, count with us!

10:54.520 --> 10:55.854
[all] Yeah!

10:56.922 --> 10:59.157
[Jake] One, two...

10:59.159 --> 11:00.725
[Cubby] Three, four...

11:00.727 --> 11:03.662
[Izzy] Five, six, seven.

11:03.664 --> 11:06.564
[Jake] Yo-ho! For solving
pirate problems today,

11:06.566 --> 11:08.700
we got seven gold doubloons!

11:09.635 --> 11:12.237
Say, mateys, what should
we do next?

11:12.239 --> 11:15.340
I know! How about payin'
a visit to Red Jessica!

11:15.342 --> 11:18.576
We didn't even get to say
hello to that swashbucklin' gal!

11:18.578 --> 11:21.446
But, Skully, we were just there.

11:21.448 --> 11:26.384
I know but,
I miss little Rosie-wosie!

11:26.386 --> 11:28.486
[all] Aww...

11:30.556 --> 11:31.690
[Rosie] Meow.

11:31.692 --> 11:35.694
Mommy missed you too,
yes she did!

11:35.696 --> 11:39.931
Thank you, James, for taking
such good care of Rosie!

11:39.933 --> 11:42.534
I never knew you
were so fond of cats.

11:42.536 --> 11:46.538
Yes, I do so love
furry little things.

11:46.540 --> 11:49.374
I've always been
quite the cat fancier!

11:49.376 --> 11:52.444
Oh, well then maybe you'd like
to meet my other kitty.

11:52.446 --> 11:54.512
Other kitty?

11:54.514 --> 11:58.416
- [Jessica] Sasha!
- [roars]

11:58.418 --> 12:01.486
[gasps] It's the tiger!

12:01.488 --> 12:03.888
Flee, ye swabs, flee!

12:03.890 --> 12:06.991
[all] Fleeing, sir, fleeing!

12:08.461 --> 12:10.595
Now what's gotten into him?

12:10.597 --> 12:11.996
[meows]

12:16.502 --> 12:18.670
[Jake] Pirate Campout!

12:18.672 --> 12:21.005
[Skully squawks <i>Reveille]</i>

12:21.007 --> 12:25.243
Rise and shine!
It's pirate campout day!

12:25.245 --> 12:29.013
All right! I can't wait
to hike to Doubloon Lagoon!

12:29.015 --> 12:34.619
Yay-hay! And I can't wait
to tell scary pirate tales

12:34.621 --> 12:37.989
around a campfire!
How about you, Cubby?

12:37.991 --> 12:42.927
Um, do we have to sleep outside.
At night? In the dark?

12:42.929 --> 12:45.930
Don't worry, matey!
We're going to stick together!

12:45.932 --> 12:48.266
We'll all watch out
for each other!

12:48.268 --> 12:50.935
Coconuts, that sounds
pretty good.

12:50.937 --> 12:56.007
Mateys, will you come along
with us on our pirate campout
to Doubloon Lagoon?

12:57.443 --> 13:00.979
Great! Remember to keep
a lookout for gold doubloons.

13:00.981 --> 13:04.716
Whenever we solve
a pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

13:04.718 --> 13:08.586
Then we'll collect 'em
and put 'em in
our Team Treasure Chest.

13:08.588 --> 13:11.022
Yo-ho, let's go camping!

13:13.993 --> 13:16.961
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away! </i>

13:16.963 --> 13:19.898
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

13:19.900 --> 13:24.435
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

13:24.437 --> 13:27.338
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

13:27.340 --> 13:29.407
<i>¶ And me </i>

13:31.977 --> 13:33.511
[Cubby] This way, mateys!

13:33.513 --> 13:34.946
To find Doubloon Lagoon,

13:34.948 --> 13:38.983
we hike all the way
to Snakey Tail Trail!

13:38.985 --> 13:41.786
Yo-ho, Cubby,
lead the way!

13:41.788 --> 13:45.657
This is going to be the best
Pirate Campout ever!

13:45.659 --> 13:48.593
Doubloon Lagoon!?

13:48.595 --> 13:50.495
Imagine!

13:50.497 --> 13:53.998
A whole lagoon filled
with gold doubloons!

13:54.000 --> 13:58.036
Lads! Who fancies
a pirate campout?

13:59.672 --> 14:01.706
<i>¶ Pirate camping we will go </i>

14:01.708 --> 14:03.975
<i>¶ Pirate camping we will go </i>

14:03.977 --> 14:07.612
<i>¶ Yo ho ho</i>
<i>Pirate camping we will go ¶</i>

14:07.614 --> 14:10.882
<i>¶ Camping with me crew</i>
<i>What a jolly thing to do ¶</i>

14:10.884 --> 14:14.586
¶ Pirate camping we will go

14:14.588 --> 14:17.722
- Popinjays!?
- Captain Hook!?

14:17.724 --> 14:20.892
Oh, funny running
into you out here.

14:20.894 --> 14:24.963
My mateys and I are off
on a pirate camping trip!

14:24.965 --> 14:27.599
Hey, that's what
we're doin'!

14:27.601 --> 14:31.569
Say, Captain Hook,
why don't you and your crew
join our pirate campout?

14:31.571 --> 14:34.806
Oh, what a
delightful notion!

14:34.808 --> 14:37.008
What say ye, men?

14:37.010 --> 14:39.978
They'd love too!
A thousand thank yous!

14:39.980 --> 14:41.880
Lead on, Cubby,
lead on!

14:41.882 --> 14:44.048
Follow me, everybody.

14:45.417 --> 14:48.086
Here we are!
Campout Clearing!

14:48.088 --> 14:52.056
Mateys, we should set up
our tents before it gets dark.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.926
OK, lads,
I'll hoist the tent!

14:56.061 --> 14:58.096
[grunting]

14:58.831 --> 15:00.465
Ohh!

15:00.467 --> 15:02.834
Thundering blunderbuss!

15:02.836 --> 15:05.069
- Cap'n?
- Where'd ya go, sir?!

15:05.071 --> 15:07.772
- Hello?
- [Hook] Ye bumbling barnacles!

15:07.774 --> 15:10.642
- I'm in here!
- [all shouting]

15:10.644 --> 15:12.644
Mateys, abandon tent!

15:15.915 --> 15:17.849
[Hook grunting]

15:18.784 --> 15:21.586
- Blast!
- Oh, my!

15:21.588 --> 15:23.788
Both tents are in tatters!

15:23.790 --> 15:25.523
Aw, coconuts!

15:25.525 --> 15:29.027
How're we gonna set up
tents without any... tents?!

15:29.029 --> 15:30.762
I've got an idea.

15:30.764 --> 15:33.898
We can build a shelter with
the things around us!

15:33.900 --> 15:36.968
- Like leaves!
- And bamboo!

15:36.970 --> 15:39.837
Yeah! And what's
left of the tents!

15:39.839 --> 15:42.106
Yo-ho, let's go!

15:44.143 --> 15:46.177
- Yeah!
- [Izzy] Yay-hey!

15:46.179 --> 15:49.213
- [Cubby] Awesome!
- Most impressive!

15:49.215 --> 15:51.883
It's nicer than
me home back home!

15:51.885 --> 15:53.518
We did it, crew!

15:53.520 --> 15:57.522
We built a shelter and
we got three gold doubloons!

15:57.524 --> 16:00.058
Let's grab 'em and
go cook up some food!

16:03.662 --> 16:07.632
Now that we've eaten, it's time
to tell scary pirate tales.

16:07.634 --> 16:08.933
- [shudders]
- [all gulp]

16:08.935 --> 16:13.604
Once upon a time,
a pirate captain and his crew

16:13.606 --> 16:15.974
were searching
for Doubloon Lagoon.

16:15.976 --> 16:18.943
Legend said the lagoon
was home to a sea monster

16:18.945 --> 16:22.914
with eight arms
and a hook on each one.

16:22.916 --> 16:24.949
[all] Eight hooks!?

16:24.951 --> 16:29.053
The pirates searched
and searched until
they found the lagoon!

16:29.055 --> 16:31.589
They were so hungry after
their long journey,

16:31.591 --> 16:34.892
they rowed out into the lagoon
to fish for their supper.

16:34.894 --> 16:38.229
They dropped their lines
overboard and waited.

16:38.231 --> 16:42.033
Oh, dear me.
[stammering] Go on.

16:42.035 --> 16:45.937
Pretty soon they heard
a weird scraping noise
on the side of the dinghy.

16:45.939 --> 16:51.075
Scrape! Scrape! Scrape!

16:51.077 --> 16:54.112
[both] Row away, pirates!
Row away!

16:54.114 --> 16:56.814
The pirates rowed away
as fast as they could,

16:56.816 --> 16:58.950
until they were sure
they were safe!

16:58.952 --> 17:02.787
Was it the monster?
Was it after them!?

17:02.789 --> 17:04.989
And that's when they found it.

17:04.991 --> 17:06.657
[all] It?

17:06.659 --> 17:09.527
Hanging off the back
of the dinghy

17:09.529 --> 17:12.263
they found a hook!

17:12.265 --> 17:14.232
[all screaming]

17:14.234 --> 17:17.101
[all] The monster is real!

17:17.103 --> 17:19.203
- Oh, my!
- [Sharkey] Climb lively!

17:19.205 --> 17:21.572
Hurry! Hurry! Ahh!

17:21.574 --> 17:23.307
It was just a story, mateys!

17:23.309 --> 17:25.176
No reason to run up a tree!

17:25.178 --> 17:28.012
Yeah. Why don't you shimmy down

17:28.014 --> 17:31.049
and we'll roast some
marshmallows over the campfire.

17:31.051 --> 17:35.953
Ooh! That'll help calm down
me shiverin' timbers!

17:35.955 --> 17:38.089
Mine too!

17:41.560 --> 17:43.027
[Cubby] This way, mateys!

17:43.029 --> 17:45.930
We're heading straight
for Doubloon Lagoon!

17:45.932 --> 17:49.200
[sigh] Lovely morning,
eh, Cap'n?

17:49.202 --> 17:51.936
I must say
I slept like a baby

17:51.938 --> 17:54.639
in the sea pups'
amazing shelter!

17:54.641 --> 17:56.808
I didn't sleep a blink!

17:56.810 --> 18:01.813
I couldn't stop thinking
about all the gold awaiting me
at Doubloon Lagoon!

18:01.815 --> 18:05.917
And now the puny pirates
are leading me right to it!

18:05.919 --> 18:08.920
Yo-ho, everybody,
at this fork in the trail,

18:08.922 --> 18:11.055
be sure you
stay to the left.

18:11.057 --> 18:12.323
The path to
the right is...

18:12.325 --> 18:14.959
Out of me way!
Me first.

18:14.961 --> 18:15.993
Ahh!

18:15.995 --> 18:19.764
Snail-Slime Trail. Ew.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.866
[grunting]

18:23.802 --> 18:28.206
Captain ho! Quick, lads,
use this fishing net
to catch him!

18:28.208 --> 18:30.675
- Careful, boys, careful!
- [Hook shouting]

18:31.677 --> 18:33.077
Oh!

18:33.079 --> 18:36.013
[groaning] So Cubby,

18:36.015 --> 18:39.383
you say, stay left?

18:39.385 --> 18:44.188
Yep. The left path leads
straight into Doubloon Lagoon!

18:44.190 --> 18:46.157
Oh, you don't say?

18:46.159 --> 18:47.925
Ah-ha!

18:47.927 --> 18:49.961
[all] Yay-hey no way!

18:49.963 --> 18:53.064
Now I shall be the first
to Doubloon Lagoon

18:53.066 --> 18:56.701
and all that gold!

18:56.703 --> 18:58.769
Gold? What gold?

18:58.771 --> 19:00.805
[Hook screams]

19:00.807 --> 19:02.473
[splash]

19:02.475 --> 19:05.643
Sounds like Captain Hook's
in trouble again.

19:05.645 --> 19:09.113
Hang tight, mateys!
I've got my sword!

19:11.917 --> 19:15.019
[all three]
Yo-ho, way to go, Jake!

19:15.021 --> 19:18.923
- [Hook grunting]
- Whoa! Doubloon Lagoon!

19:18.925 --> 19:20.725
We found it!

19:20.727 --> 19:24.729
[Izzy] From up here, it looks
just like a real doubloon!

19:24.731 --> 19:25.997
[Jake] A real big one!

19:25.999 --> 19:28.099
And for findin' Doubloon Lagoon,

19:28.101 --> 19:31.102
we got three more
gold doubloons!

19:31.104 --> 19:34.338
Let's grab 'em and go...

19:34.340 --> 19:36.040
Ahoy?!

19:36.042 --> 19:37.942
Smee! Sharky! Bones!

19:37.944 --> 19:40.178
Throw me a vine
or something!

19:40.180 --> 19:43.281
[all gasping, stammering]

19:44.449 --> 19:46.918
What are you babbling about...?

19:46.920 --> 19:49.687
- [burbles]
- The monster!

19:49.689 --> 19:52.023
- Save me!
- [burbles]

19:52.025 --> 19:54.992
[shouting]

19:56.128 --> 19:57.929
Yo-ho, what do you know!

19:57.931 --> 19:59.964
It's our old friend the Octopus!

19:59.966 --> 20:03.701
[laughs] He's trying
to play with Captain Hook.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.836
But I don't think
Hook knows it.

20:05.838 --> 20:09.040
For Captain Hook,
this is an emergency.

20:09.042 --> 20:11.709
Pixie dust, away!

20:11.711 --> 20:14.045
- Hurray!
- Go popinjays!

20:14.047 --> 20:16.180
Save the Cap'n!

20:17.049 --> 20:20.451
[groans] It's got me!
It's got me!

20:20.453 --> 20:22.954
Help!

20:22.956 --> 20:24.322
Ahoy, Captain Hook!

20:24.324 --> 20:28.226
You! You saved me
from the monster!

20:28.228 --> 20:31.062
He's no monster!
He's our friend!

20:31.064 --> 20:34.332
[burbles]

20:35.467 --> 20:38.336
Bah! No gold!

20:38.338 --> 20:40.204
Creatures from the deep!

20:40.206 --> 20:42.173
Sleeping on the ground!

20:42.175 --> 20:47.878
This has been the very worst
pirate campout imaginable!

20:48.513 --> 20:50.248
Onward, ye landlubbers!

20:50.250 --> 20:52.883
Back to the <i>Jolly Roger!</i>

20:52.885 --> 20:56.020
Yo-ho, mateys.
We found Doubloon Lagoon

20:56.022 --> 20:59.056
and saved Hook from
a "creature from the deep".

20:59.058 --> 21:02.159
[laughs] And we got
three more gold doubloons!

21:02.161 --> 21:05.496
Let's grab 'em and
go back to Pirate Island!

21:07.132 --> 21:09.934
So long, Octopus!
See ya around!

21:09.936 --> 21:11.168
[burbles]

21:13.438 --> 21:15.940
Yo-ho, way to go, mateys!

21:15.942 --> 21:18.342
Thanks for joining
our fun Pirate Campout!

21:18.344 --> 21:22.947
Now let's put all our
gold doubloons into our
Team Treasure Chest.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.323
<i>¶ Way hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

21:32.325 --> 21:34.358
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

21:34.360 --> 21:36.260
<i>¶ Way hey</i>
<i>with help from you ¶</i>

21:36.262 --> 21:39.196
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

21:39.198 --> 21:41.866
Come on, count with us!

21:42.934 --> 21:44.235
[all] Yeah!

21:45.971 --> 21:48.439
[Izzy] One, two, three...

21:48.441 --> 21:51.042
[Cubby] Four, five, six...

21:51.044 --> 21:53.878
[Jake] Seven, eight, nine!

21:53.880 --> 21:57.048
Yo-ho! For solving
pirate problems today,

21:57.050 --> 22:00.184
we got nine gold doubloons!

22:00.186 --> 22:04.055
Hey, mateys, let's keep this
pirate campout goin'!

22:04.057 --> 22:06.457
Awesome pirate plan, Cubby!

22:06.459 --> 22:11.028
Thanks! I've even got
a scary pirate tale to tell.

22:11.030 --> 22:15.166
It's called <i>Hook and the</i>
<i>Haunted Coconut!</i>

22:15.168 --> 22:20.271
Once upon a time there
was a coconut that flew
in the night,

22:20.273 --> 22:22.139
hooting like an owl.

22:22.141 --> 22:27.044
"Hoooo! Who likes coco-nuts?

22:27.046 --> 22:29.480
Captain Hooook?"

22:29.482 --> 22:32.083
[both laughing]

22:36.321 --> 22:39.123
[Smee] Ah, back at last, Cap'n!

22:39.125 --> 22:41.025
Home sweet ship!

22:41.027 --> 22:44.595
Yes, thank Neptune that
pirate campout is over!

22:44.597 --> 22:47.898
And that the sea monster
wasn't real!

22:47.900 --> 22:51.635
[stammering] Cap'n,
the monster that wasn't real,

22:51.637 --> 22:54.004
really was real!

22:54.006 --> 22:56.140
[all shouting]

22:56.142 --> 23:00.478
Get back here, you silly
insubordinate swabs...

23:01.346 --> 23:03.381
Gah!

23:03.383 --> 23:05.916
Wait for me!

23:11.056 --> 23:13.157
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

23:13.159 --> 23:15.426
<i>¶ I sent out me invitations </i>

23:15.428 --> 23:18.162
<i>¶ Can't wait</i>
<i>'cause today is the day ¶</i>

23:18.164 --> 23:20.598
