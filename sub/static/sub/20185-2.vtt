00:08.007 --> 00:11.876
Probably recover the
bull wheel, all the pulleys.

00:11.912 --> 00:14.212
A lot of lumber can be salvaged, too.

00:14.247 --> 00:18.416
Just enough to build a gallows.

00:20.554 --> 00:22.654
We gotta get another rig up and running.

00:22.689 --> 00:25.390
Start making calls.

00:25.425 --> 00:27.258
To who?

00:27.294 --> 00:29.160
We're not gonna get any
money out of the banks.

00:29.196 --> 00:31.062
Not after this.

00:31.098 --> 00:33.698
There's oil underneath this ground,

00:33.734 --> 00:35.266
and I intend to get it out,

00:35.302 --> 00:38.336
even if it means the three
of us digging our way to Hades

00:38.372 --> 00:39.571
with a pick and shovel

00:39.606 --> 00:41.106
Now figure it out!

00:41.141 --> 00:43.575
Well, we do have that
orphan eight sections

00:43.610 --> 00:44.864
up by the Midkiffs'.

00:44.867 --> 00:47.379
Are you suggesting we
sell to Percy Midkiff?

00:47.414 --> 00:48.713
Just those eight sections.

00:48.749 --> 00:50.825
That Bible-thumpin' son of a bitch?

00:50.828 --> 00:53.118
There ain't nothing up there
but brush and ladino bulls.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.387
You talk to me when you get serious.

01:01.094 --> 01:04.229
Selling land ain't exactly Daddy's way.

01:04.263 --> 01:05.915
I'll tell you one thing...

01:05.918 --> 01:08.299
We're about down to
selling that eight sections

01:08.301 --> 01:10.101
or having the bank sell
the whole ranch for us.

01:10.103 --> 01:11.669
You don't have to convince me.

01:13.774 --> 01:16.741
So, I guess you're just
expecting me to fix everything?

01:16.777 --> 01:18.710
As usual.

01:18.745 --> 01:21.146
I guess I better get to it, then.

01:24.818 --> 01:26.751
What about that other thing?

01:26.787 --> 01:28.953
It's being handled.

01:28.989 --> 01:30.455
By you or him?

01:30.490 --> 01:32.123
I got it covered. Don't you worry.

01:32.159 --> 01:34.959
Worrying is my job, little brother

01:40.767 --> 01:42.333
Morning, Mr. Sullivan.

01:42.369 --> 01:43.601
Hey, there, honey.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.670
You been out here a while.

01:45.705 --> 01:46.912
- Yep.
- Making sure those

01:46.915 --> 01:48.341
bandits don't come back?

01:48.375 --> 01:50.775
Well, if they do, they
sure gonna be sorry.

01:53.513 --> 01:55.613
But the river's that way.

01:55.649 --> 01:58.082
Isn't that where they'd
be approaching from?

01:58.118 --> 02:00.218
Why, I wish I would have
thought of that myself.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.789
That better?

02:06.560 --> 02:10.461
Now why don't you go on
inside and practice your piano?

02:10.497 --> 02:11.930
I know your granddaddy would love

02:11.965 --> 02:14.499
to hear you plink out
"Red River Valley" one day.

02:14.534 --> 02:16.668
That's boring.

02:16.703 --> 02:19.003
Well, then some other dulcet tune.

02:19.039 --> 02:21.039
Now go on. Git.

02:21.074 --> 02:22.774
Before I put you over my knee.

02:22.809 --> 02:26.478
I think my daddy might have
something to say about that.

_

_

05:07.654 --> 05:09.454
Where do you think he is?

05:09.489 --> 05:11.990
I have no idea.

05:21.101 --> 05:22.500
Hmm.

05:27.274 --> 05:29.140
Okay, amigo.

05:29.175 --> 05:30.708
I'm letting you down.

05:41.788 --> 05:44.522
You destroyed my property.

05:48.061 --> 05:49.761
I wanna know why.

05:49.796 --> 05:53.364
Was it a reprisal for Armando?

06:00.573 --> 06:02.106
Suit yourself.

06:09.249 --> 06:10.748
From what everyone says,

06:10.784 --> 06:12.784
Cesar threw his lot
in with a rough crowd.

06:14.254 --> 06:15.887
You'd be surprised
how often these sorts,

06:15.922 --> 06:18.389
they disappear for a few
days, and then pop back up.

06:18.425 --> 06:20.792
Now maybe he's blowing
off steam in Mexico?

06:20.827 --> 06:25.396
Well, listen here, uh, here's a thought.

06:25.432 --> 06:27.966
The one oil rig the McCulloughs had up

06:28.001 --> 06:29.767
was attacked last night.

06:29.803 --> 06:32.603
I wonder if maybe Cesar was involved.

06:32.639 --> 06:34.978
Might explain his sudden disappearance.

06:36.187 --> 06:38.816
Well, that seems very unlikely to me.

06:38.847 --> 06:40.519
But you are right

06:40.535 --> 06:43.292
that was something wrong
happens around here,

06:43.320 --> 06:45.948
there's a tendency to blame
men who look like Cesar.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.352
Perhaps colonel McCullough

06:48.355 --> 06:50.154
was upset over the loss of his property

06:50.190 --> 06:52.457
and got the wrong idea
about my brother-in-law.

06:52.492 --> 06:56.260
Well, Eli is not exactly the
type to go off half-cocked.

06:56.296 --> 06:58.796
I'm sure you realize that
most of the voters in this town

06:58.832 --> 07:00.231
are Tejano?

07:00.266 --> 07:02.900
It would be so
unfortunate if word spread

07:02.936 --> 07:05.503
that you refused to
investigate the disappearance

07:05.538 --> 07:07.405
of Pedro GarcÃ­a's son-in-law.

07:07.440 --> 07:09.640
I'd consider it a personal favor

07:09.676 --> 07:11.776
if you would speak to Eli McCullough.

07:27.694 --> 07:30.395
Where are your friends
crossing the river?

07:46.980 --> 07:48.646
Mm-hmm.

07:48.681 --> 07:50.148
What are they hitting next?

07:58.992 --> 08:00.358
What town are they coming from?

08:00.393 --> 08:01.526
Could I get a word?

08:12.372 --> 08:14.405
How far you planning on taking this?

08:14.441 --> 08:17.675
There are consequences
for a man's decisions...

08:17.710 --> 08:20.812
no matter what his last name.

08:20.847 --> 08:22.747
Aw, shit.

08:31.057 --> 08:32.957
Don't look at me.

08:34.928 --> 08:36.894
Keep an eye on this situation.

08:36.929 --> 08:38.895
- You got it, boss.
- Come on.

08:40.491 --> 08:42.366
You should just turn
him over to the sheriff.

08:42.368 --> 08:44.368
Be done with it.

08:44.404 --> 08:48.005
Well, we got to find out
what we're up against first.

08:48.041 --> 08:50.508
And the law is not
gonna help us do that.

08:50.543 --> 08:51.943
You beat a man long enough,

08:51.978 --> 08:53.978
he'll admit to crucifying the Savior.

08:56.112 --> 08:58.684
Probably best to let me do the talking.

09:06.826 --> 09:08.726
Ahh.

09:15.969 --> 09:18.136
So, what'd you do with the Mexican?

09:18.171 --> 09:21.472
Which Mexican are we talking about?

09:23.243 --> 09:24.609
Eli.

09:27.180 --> 09:30.414
I assume he got caught during
that unfortunate incident

09:30.450 --> 09:32.550
at your drilling rig.

09:32.585 --> 09:36.320
Those sons of bitches,
they got away scot-free.

09:36.356 --> 09:39.090
Is that right?

09:47.634 --> 09:51.569
Look, a man has a right
to protect his property.

09:51.604 --> 09:54.906
But I cannot have another incident.

09:54.941 --> 09:56.774
Am I right, Pete?

09:56.809 --> 09:59.143
Oh, I've been saying that for a while.

09:59.179 --> 10:01.245
Things need to simmer down.

10:01.281 --> 10:02.947
They sure as hell do.

10:04.859 --> 10:09.028
Pete, you heard anything
about this missing Cesar fella?

10:09.055 --> 10:12.390
Only that he travels
with a dangerous crowd.

10:18.865 --> 10:21.832
God damn it, Eli, you know
I wouldn't even be here

10:21.868 --> 10:23.534
if it wasn't for the election coming.

10:23.570 --> 10:25.536
- Mm-hmm.
- And the fact is,

10:25.572 --> 10:28.472
you can't win anything around
here without the Mexican vote.

10:28.508 --> 10:31.342
That means a lot of
cabrito come election day.

10:31.377 --> 10:33.511
Oh, well, believe me,
you have our support.

10:37.684 --> 10:39.951
You know, the Midkiffs
were generous enough

10:39.986 --> 10:41.352
to kick in $100.

10:43.489 --> 10:45.189
Well, now.

10:45.225 --> 10:46.991
Mark us down for $200.

10:47.026 --> 10:50.428
Well, that is exceedingly generous.

10:51.705 --> 10:53.197
Thank you.

11:03.209 --> 11:05.543

11:05.578 --> 11:11.181

11:11.184 --> 11:12.750

11:19.726 --> 11:21.092

11:21.431 --> 11:23.893

11:23.896 --> 11:25.863
_

11:28.034 --> 11:29.767
_

11:29.856 --> 11:31.317
_

11:34.440 --> 11:36.841
_

11:38.244 --> 11:41.579
_

11:41.614 --> 11:43.781
_

12:29.817 --> 12:31.223
It's not just newspapers.

12:31.226 --> 12:32.912
I found these in his desk, too.

12:39.794 --> 12:42.061
Burn all this...

12:42.097 --> 12:43.396
and anything else you find.

12:43.431 --> 12:45.131
Please.

12:47.602 --> 12:49.669
Your son-in-law has disappeared.

12:49.704 --> 12:52.438
He does that sometimes.

12:57.946 --> 13:00.146
You knew.

13:00.181 --> 13:02.348
You knew what he was doing.

13:02.384 --> 13:05.618
Maria, I am aware of what
goes on in my own home.

13:05.654 --> 13:07.487
Do you share these sympathies with him?

13:07.522 --> 13:11.624
I share his belief that being
born Mexican in this valley

13:11.660 --> 13:13.226
is very bad luck.

13:15.030 --> 13:18.064
_

13:30.512 --> 13:32.145
_

14:11.252 --> 14:13.686
You know, amigo...

14:13.722 --> 14:15.688
the sun is gonna come up tomorrow,

14:15.724 --> 14:17.757
whether you live or die.

14:17.792 --> 14:20.193
You got to start thinking
about what kind of life

14:20.228 --> 14:21.861
your family is gonna have without you.

14:27.736 --> 14:30.036
You have a new baby, right?

14:57.665 --> 15:00.199
Think about your boy.

15:00.235 --> 15:03.403
All he'll ever know about
you is that, one night,

15:03.438 --> 15:05.905
you up and disappeared without a trace.

15:05.940 --> 15:09.709
He'll spend his whole life
wondering if you're really dead

15:09.751 --> 15:11.951
or if maybe you just met some whore

15:11.954 --> 15:15.230
on the other side of the river.

15:15.233 --> 15:17.083
He'll never know you're
lying dead in a hole

15:17.085 --> 15:19.252
somewhere out in our pastures.

15:19.287 --> 15:21.721
What else can I do?

15:21.756 --> 15:23.423
Tell me who's been stealing our cattle

15:23.458 --> 15:25.591
and where I can find them, and
I'll drive you to the river,

15:25.593 --> 15:27.593
watch you cross over into Mexico.

15:27.629 --> 15:29.395
Send for your wife and your boy.

15:29.431 --> 15:31.297
You can start a new life there.

15:33.898 --> 15:36.365
- You'll never let me go.
- I'm a man of my word.

15:36.371 --> 15:37.531
Your last name is McCullough.

15:37.539 --> 15:39.105
I'm not my father.

15:43.344 --> 15:45.778
I'm done talking.

15:48.016 --> 15:51.350
I need this, Fred. Please.

15:53.354 --> 15:56.956
Then use your God-given charms
and get him to take a meeting.

15:56.991 --> 15:58.791
Tell him to bring his checkbook.

15:58.827 --> 16:00.422
All right.

16:05.066 --> 16:06.566
Things all right?

16:08.803 --> 16:10.536
I dunno.

16:10.572 --> 16:12.186
Are they?

16:12.189 --> 16:13.806
Yeah, we're gonna get another rig,

16:13.808 --> 16:15.975
and this will never happen again...

16:16.010 --> 16:18.311
even if I have to sit out
there all night in my pajamas

16:18.346 --> 16:19.312
to guard it.

16:28.923 --> 16:30.990
What is it, darling?

16:31.025 --> 16:33.326
Can I make a confession?

16:33.361 --> 16:35.027
Mm-hmm.

16:36.431 --> 16:40.333
Sometimes I think we'd be better off

16:40.368 --> 16:42.702
if things didn't work out here.

16:42.737 --> 16:46.839
We could sell this land,
have plenty of money,

16:46.875 --> 16:51.511
and all live somewhere safe, be happy.

16:54.182 --> 16:57.149
You are the rock of this family.

16:57.185 --> 16:59.151
- We all know it.
- Stop it.

16:59.187 --> 17:01.254
Well, if I ever gave up
my calcified-bachelor ways,

17:01.289 --> 17:03.289
I'd want a wife just like you.

17:09.097 --> 17:10.530
Oh, God.

17:10.565 --> 17:13.098
Sometimes I think I
married the wrong brother.

17:17.605 --> 17:20.071
Don't look nervous.

17:23.111 --> 17:26.045
Just figure out a way
to get us out of here.

17:44.165 --> 17:46.198
Thank you for meeting me.

17:46.234 --> 17:48.701
What's on your mind, old friend?

17:48.736 --> 17:51.270
All I've ever wanted
was to be left alone...

17:51.306 --> 17:53.973
to run my ranch in peace.

17:54.008 --> 17:57.777
Sounds like we want the same thing.

17:57.812 --> 18:00.580
Unfortunately, my livelihood, my ranch,

18:00.615 --> 18:01.881
is coming under attack

18:01.916 --> 18:03.783
from criminals crossing your land.

18:03.818 --> 18:06.552
Not even God himself
can stop a few thieves

18:06.588 --> 18:07.987
from crossing a river, Eli.

18:08.022 --> 18:10.156
The other night wasn't
some drunk copper-belly

18:10.191 --> 18:12.124
running off with a slick calf.

18:12.160 --> 18:13.593
That oil rig

18:13.628 --> 18:15.628
cost me an arm and a
leg of borrowed money.

18:15.663 --> 18:18.664
I don't want these bandits
around any more than you do.

18:18.700 --> 18:19.799
Believe me.

18:19.834 --> 18:21.601
And still they ride...

18:21.636 --> 18:24.637
untroubled by your disapproval.

18:26.174 --> 18:28.941
Here is the reason I
wanted to meet with you.

18:28.977 --> 18:31.110
Certain things have been
brought to my attention

18:31.145 --> 18:32.645
about Cesar.

18:32.680 --> 18:34.981
If I find they are true,

18:35.016 --> 18:38.317
then I no longer consider
him a part of my family.

18:38.360 --> 18:42.278
And I will consider this
matter between us closed.

18:42.307 --> 18:47.109
But in exchange for this, I need peace.

18:47.145 --> 18:49.478
You leave my family alone.

18:49.514 --> 18:52.148
You leave my men alone.

18:52.183 --> 18:54.550
Do we have a deal?

18:57.755 --> 18:59.221
Well, that depends.

18:59.257 --> 19:00.723
On what?

19:03.494 --> 19:05.828
Are you gonna replace my rig?

19:05.863 --> 19:08.898
Are you gonna replace Armando?

19:08.933 --> 19:10.833
How about Cesar?

19:10.868 --> 19:12.535
My daughter is now a widow.

19:12.570 --> 19:14.537
And my grandson has no father.

19:16.226 --> 19:18.596
I am trying to avoid a war here, Eli.

19:23.047 --> 19:25.715
Nice talking with you, neighbor.

19:30.588 --> 19:32.722
Hyah! Hyah!

19:32.757 --> 19:35.725
Huh!

19:35.760 --> 19:37.159
Hyah! Hyah!

19:37.195 --> 19:38.594
Hyah!

19:44.524 --> 19:46.758
We already ate.

19:46.794 --> 19:49.561
A man that toils outdoors
works up a big appetite.

19:49.597 --> 19:50.929
You'd best remember that

19:50.965 --> 19:52.798
when you've got a husband of your own.

19:52.833 --> 19:55.067
I ain't never getting married.

19:55.102 --> 19:57.469
You aren't getting
married, not "ain't."

19:57.504 --> 19:59.871
And a young lady pretty as you

19:59.907 --> 20:01.773
will soon be fighting
off handsome young suitors

20:01.775 --> 20:03.428
- with a stick.
- Any suitors

20:03.431 --> 20:05.613
come around me, I'll shoot 'em.

20:16.090 --> 20:18.790
You born around here?

20:18.826 --> 20:20.926
Curious, that's all.

20:23.130 --> 20:26.632
I was born in Brownsville.

20:26.667 --> 20:28.500
You miss it?

20:28.535 --> 20:29.968
Not really.

20:30.004 --> 20:34.940
We had nearly two
sections when I was born,

20:34.975 --> 20:37.643
but it was all taken.

20:37.678 --> 20:39.278
We ended up picking cotton.

20:39.313 --> 20:41.346
Hard way to earn a living.

20:41.382 --> 20:43.415
We were in the fields six days a week...

20:43.450 --> 20:46.351
My father, two brothers, and my sister.

20:46.387 --> 20:47.853
Papa thought he could save up

20:47.888 --> 20:49.988
to buy us a little rancho again.

20:50.024 --> 20:51.916
But that never happened.

20:51.919 --> 20:53.025
How come?

20:53.060 --> 20:55.460
One day, a few Rangers
showed up in the fields

20:55.496 --> 20:57.260
looking for Emilio Sanchez.

20:57.263 --> 20:59.296
Said he stole a horse.

20:59.331 --> 21:03.467
Never mind my father's name
was Emilio Lopez.

21:03.502 --> 21:06.503
Never mind we had no horse.

21:06.539 --> 21:08.772
They dragged him into the brasada.

21:08.808 --> 21:12.576
We heard the shots.

21:12.611 --> 21:15.245
Then they rode off
like nothing happened.

21:17.817 --> 21:21.852
A Mexican is a Mexican, right?

21:21.887 --> 21:24.488
They had to get someone.

21:26.892 --> 21:29.026
I'm real sorry.

21:34.066 --> 21:36.467
Thanks for the food.

22:02.201 --> 22:05.569
I make him a drink every
night before supper.

22:05.598 --> 22:09.066
I thought it'd be bad
luck to skip tonight.

22:09.101 --> 22:11.368
Well, you're right.

22:11.403 --> 22:13.670
He hasn't been gone that long.

22:16.275 --> 22:20.310
I'll speak with the
sheriff again tomorrow.

22:20.346 --> 22:22.246
He won't do anything.

22:22.281 --> 22:24.014
Nothing will happen.

22:24.049 --> 22:27.050
I will still be here
wondering where my husband is.

22:27.086 --> 22:30.687
Well, whatever happens,
we'll get through it together.

22:32.224 --> 22:34.024
Will we?

22:36.262 --> 22:39.496
Your whole life you have
come and gone as you pleased.

22:39.532 --> 22:42.399
You're only here because
you have nowhere else to go.

22:42.434 --> 22:44.067
I know.

22:44.103 --> 22:46.570
I know that when you're feeling
better, you're gonna leave.

22:46.605 --> 22:48.338
Ana.

22:48.374 --> 22:50.908
But my husband will still be dead,

22:50.943 --> 22:53.343
and my child will still have no father.

22:53.379 --> 22:55.646
Don't say that. You don't know that.

22:58.484 --> 23:00.517
I know what Cesar has been doing.

23:00.553 --> 23:02.953
He didn't want me to know, but I did.

23:05.157 --> 23:08.392
I knew the risks, just like he did.

23:16.742 --> 23:18.635
Look, I understand you've got grievances.

23:18.637 --> 23:20.370
I'd feel the same if
I was in your position.

23:20.406 --> 23:22.406
You would never be in my position.

23:22.441 --> 23:25.275
You know there's a
race war brewing here.

23:25.311 --> 23:26.977
If these attacks keep up, the whites

23:27.012 --> 23:28.745
are gonna declare open
season on Mexicans.

23:28.781 --> 23:31.448
If war is what it takes to
bring justice to the region,

23:31.483 --> 23:32.616
so be it.

23:32.651 --> 23:34.418
What would be justice, in your mind?

23:34.453 --> 23:37.821
All you Anglos getting
out of South Texas.

23:37.856 --> 23:40.290
That's what every Mexican wants.

23:42.027 --> 23:45.162
All the Mexicans I know,
they... they want good jobs,

23:45.197 --> 23:46.463
good schools.

23:46.498 --> 23:47.898
They want to feel safe.

23:47.933 --> 23:49.266
They don't want a war.

23:49.301 --> 23:52.402
- You're wrong.
- You know something I don't?

23:52.438 --> 23:55.339
This is a much larger
movement than you understand.

23:59.211 --> 24:01.812
A few weeks ago, a
group of Mexican patriots

24:01.847 --> 24:04.081
gathered in secret to draft a manifesto.

24:04.116 --> 24:05.849
It's been circulating among my people,

24:05.884 --> 24:08.118
published in papers
your kind don't read.

24:08.153 --> 24:09.653
"El Plan de San Diego."

24:09.688 --> 24:11.588
Made the English-language papers, too.

24:11.624 --> 24:13.090
Probably did more to recruit people

24:13.116 --> 24:14.918
to the Law and Order
League than anything else.

24:14.920 --> 24:16.325
It doesn't matter.

24:16.328 --> 24:19.529
Very soon, my people will
rise up and take back our land.

24:19.565 --> 24:22.766
From 100 million Americans.

24:22.801 --> 24:24.201
From the United States Army.

24:24.236 --> 24:25.836
How exactly you see that working?

24:25.871 --> 24:27.938
Go ahead.

24:27.973 --> 24:30.007
Underestimate us.

24:32.044 --> 24:34.244
We're counting on it.

24:43.222 --> 24:45.956
I ain't selling to the Midkiffs.

24:45.991 --> 24:47.691
Well, we may not have to.

24:47.726 --> 24:49.126
I found us a lead in Austin.

24:49.161 --> 24:51.628
We got a lunch meeting
tomorrow at the Driskill.

24:51.664 --> 24:54.231
Tomorrow?

24:54.266 --> 24:57.334
That's a 10-hour drive.

24:57.369 --> 25:00.203
Time is of the essence.

25:04.176 --> 25:06.510
You done good, son.

25:32.538 --> 25:34.404
You find out anything?

25:34.440 --> 25:36.360
He's a real true believer,
but I got him talking.

25:36.375 --> 25:38.175
Well, did he give you any specifics?

25:38.210 --> 25:40.043
No, but he's loosening up.

25:40.079 --> 25:42.112
Well, I'm afraid we're out of time.

25:42.147 --> 25:44.581
Your brother and I are
leaving for the city.

25:46.279 --> 25:48.051
Wait. Daddy.

25:53.125 --> 25:54.091
No!

25:59.798 --> 26:01.998
Shh.

26:03.435 --> 26:05.035
Who blew up my rig?

26:05.070 --> 26:06.703
Huh?

26:12.478 --> 26:15.679
Aniceto PizaÃ±a.

26:25.023 --> 26:27.624
Turn his head.

26:30.596 --> 26:34.164
Now, where are they hitting next?

26:34.199 --> 26:36.633
T-T-They don't tell me.

26:36.668 --> 26:39.336
This can go on for a
long time if you want.

26:39.371 --> 26:41.905
- They don't tell me anything.
- Hmm?

26:41.940 --> 26:43.273
Hmm?

26:43.308 --> 26:45.509
Please, I swear! I don't know!

26:45.544 --> 26:47.177
Please! Please, I swear.

26:47.212 --> 26:48.945
I swear, please! I don't know!

26:48.981 --> 26:50.313
I don't know.

27:00.058 --> 27:01.858
Ah. Well, I reckon this son of a bitch

27:01.894 --> 27:03.426
is telling the truth.

27:03.462 --> 27:05.128
Yeah.

27:34.041 --> 27:36.041
_

27:36.170 --> 27:39.533
_

28:39.440 --> 28:41.440
There's nowhere to run.

28:41.475 --> 28:45.144
The closest whites are 500 miles away.

28:45.179 --> 28:47.913
This land kills you quickly.

28:47.948 --> 28:50.849
I'll be fine.

28:50.885 --> 28:54.353
I see the confusion in your eyes.

28:54.388 --> 28:57.222
The four directions all
look the same to you.

29:00.628 --> 29:02.461
You'll die out there.

29:04.799 --> 29:07.466
Just let me go... please.

29:07.501 --> 29:10.035
Mm. Do not beg. It dishonors you.

29:10.071 --> 29:13.138
These women beat me every day.

29:14.601 --> 29:16.401
I'd rather die than be a slave.

29:19.714 --> 29:22.548
From the dust of the four directions,

29:22.583 --> 29:24.717
The Great Spirit Nanisuwukai

29:24.752 --> 29:27.119
created the first man on earth.

29:27.154 --> 29:29.822
He was alone in this great new world

29:29.857 --> 29:31.223
he did not understand.

29:31.258 --> 29:33.692
Soon he was starving.

29:33.728 --> 29:36.895
He would stare all day
at this tall plum tree

29:36.931 --> 29:39.231
whose branches were
heavy with ripe fruit.

29:39.266 --> 29:43.635
But Coyote was there, watching.

29:43.671 --> 29:46.205
Every time the man reached for the plum,

29:46.240 --> 29:47.973
Coyote said,

29:48.008 --> 29:50.909
"Do not touch that, or I will bite you."

29:50.945 --> 29:53.846
So, what did the man do?

29:58.386 --> 30:00.352
Eat your plum, Eli.

30:00.388 --> 30:03.422
Sometimes it's better to
get bitten than to starve.

30:05.593 --> 30:07.693
What the hell is wrong with you?

30:09.130 --> 30:11.730
I remember Aniceto PizaÃ±a.

30:11.766 --> 30:13.766
Tejano rancher.

30:13.801 --> 30:15.868
Ran off his land last summer.

30:15.903 --> 30:17.536
His boy lost a leg in the shootout.

30:17.571 --> 30:19.104
I'm more concerned with
the man who lost an ear

30:19.106 --> 30:19.968
in our goddamn shed.

30:19.971 --> 30:21.940
What am I supposed to do with him now?

30:21.942 --> 30:24.910
Can't return a steak with
a bite taken out of it.

30:24.945 --> 30:27.130
Unh-unh. No. Those days are over.

30:27.133 --> 30:28.866
You sound like a hayseed, son.

30:28.869 --> 30:30.249
I understand things just fine.

30:30.251 --> 30:32.317
No, you don't.

30:32.320 --> 30:34.454
You've had it far too easy for too long.

30:37.291 --> 30:39.558
We start killin' folks
like the old days,

30:39.593 --> 30:40.926
it's gonna become a habit

30:40.961 --> 30:42.561
that spreads faster than a brush fire.

30:42.596 --> 30:45.327
- You know that better than anybody.
- Hmm.

30:45.330 --> 30:47.393
It's up to people like
us to set the example,

30:47.401 --> 30:48.801
'cause if we don't,

30:48.836 --> 30:50.969
this whole civilization
slides backwards.

30:51.005 --> 30:53.405
You say slides backward.

30:53.441 --> 30:56.675
I say reverts to its natural state.

31:01.982 --> 31:06.418
I know you've seen the
worst mankind has to offer.

31:06.454 --> 31:09.221
But so have I.

31:09.256 --> 31:11.590
The only thing stopping my kids

31:11.625 --> 31:13.826
living through the
same shit you and I did

31:13.861 --> 31:15.394
is deciding to make the hard choices

31:15.429 --> 31:16.595
instead of the easy ones.

31:16.630 --> 31:18.163
It's deciding not to kill folks

31:18.199 --> 31:19.832
when there's no good reason.

31:19.867 --> 31:22.703
The world is what it is.

31:22.706 --> 31:25.838
You think that man in
there forgives and forgets?

31:25.873 --> 31:29.241
Hell, he's already
dynamited our property once.

31:29.276 --> 31:32.311
Maybe the next time it's a bit
of dynamite under Sally's car

31:32.346 --> 31:33.779
and Jeannie's school.

31:35.115 --> 31:37.649
That a risk you're willing to take?

31:43.491 --> 31:45.991
I'm sure you're gonna
do the right thing.

32:07.681 --> 32:10.015
_

32:10.804 --> 32:13.473
_

32:15.715 --> 32:17.115
_

32:19.813 --> 32:21.231
_

32:22.263 --> 32:24.776
_

32:32.039 --> 32:34.072
_

33:21.255 --> 33:24.318
_

33:25.128 --> 33:26.588
_

33:27.714 --> 33:29.060
_

35:07.802 --> 35:10.771
"I was powerful glad to
get away from the feuds,

35:10.806 --> 35:13.174
and so was Jim to get
away from the swamp.

35:13.209 --> 35:17.044
And we said there weren't
no home like a raft, after all.

35:17.079 --> 35:19.547
Other places do seem so
cramped up and smothery,

35:19.582 --> 35:21.182
but a raft don't.

35:21.217 --> 35:24.985
You feel mighty free and easy
and comfortable on a raft."

35:27.590 --> 35:29.123
Aw. What happens next?

35:29.158 --> 35:32.459
You're gonna have to wait for tomorrow.

35:32.495 --> 35:36.297
It was against the law to help
an escaped slave, wasn't it?

35:36.332 --> 35:39.033
Sure was.

35:39.068 --> 35:44.004
So Huck was doing something wrong.

35:44.040 --> 35:47.441
Most everyone thought so, yeah.

35:49.545 --> 35:52.246
I would have helped him, too.

36:01.857 --> 36:03.424
Sweet dreams, honey.

36:03.459 --> 36:05.059
Night, Daddy.

37:15.287 --> 37:16.687
Get up.

38:00.776 --> 38:02.643
Where are you taking me?

38:02.678 --> 38:05.579
Keep your voice down.

38:05.614 --> 38:07.214
Get in there.

38:56.499 --> 38:58.132
- Can you swim?
- Yeah.

38:58.167 --> 39:00.968
Good. Let's go.

39:05.241 --> 39:07.207
You're letting me go?

39:07.243 --> 39:09.877
Just like that?

39:09.912 --> 39:12.612
You can't ever show your
face around here again.

39:13.849 --> 39:17.317
You understand?

39:17.353 --> 39:20.721
When I'm halfway
across, you'll shoot me.

39:20.756 --> 39:22.389
Why would I do that?

39:22.425 --> 39:23.924
No mess to clean up.

39:23.959 --> 39:25.893
My body would drift downriver,

39:25.928 --> 39:27.327
maybe all the way to the Gulf.

39:27.363 --> 39:30.364
I told you... I'm not my father.

39:30.399 --> 39:31.899
