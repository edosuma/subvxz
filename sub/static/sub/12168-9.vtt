00:21.086 --> 00:22.286
May I join you?

00:32.644 --> 00:35.220
It's called Chess. It's a game.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.520
They've been sitting there
like that since I sat down.

00:39.515 --> 00:41.268
Those two? They play every single day.

00:41.303 --> 00:43.624
Neither one of them's even blinked yet.

00:43.659 --> 00:46.117
Well, it's not really a game of action.

00:47.968 --> 00:48.942
I can see that.

00:50.526 --> 00:57.082
It's all about strategy. He's planning his next
move and the move after that and the move after that.

00:57.117 --> 01:00.152
You guys do a lot of that around here.

01:00.187 --> 01:05.733
Yes we do. I take it that's
not how you prefer to do things.

01:06.322 --> 01:09.398
No. I'm leaving.

01:09.523 --> 01:14.107
Hey! Ronon, wait. Just because we do things
differently, doesn't mean we can't learn from each other.

01:14.419 --> 01:17.813
And col Sheppard has already
invested an incredible amount of time

01:20.664 --> 01:20.673
and energy trying to make you
an intregal part of his team.

01:22.671 --> 01:24.300
I mean't, I'm leaving the table.

01:27.719 --> 01:28.656
Oh.

01:28.972 --> 01:29.698
Is that ok?

01:29.733 --> 01:31.678
Yes of course. I'm
sorry. I thought that...

01:31.713 --> 01:33.562
Dr Weir?

01:33.597 --> 01:35.400
Rodney, what is it?

01:37.788 --> 01:38.122
Something you should see here.

01:38.157 --> 01:43.177
I'm on my way.

01:43.212 --> 01:45.258
I'm leaving too.

01:45.293 --> 01:46.705
Ok.

01:46.740 --> 01:48.955
Ok

01:48.990 --> 01:49.953
What is it?

01:49.988 --> 01:55.421
That is the signature of an Ancient ship called
the Aurora. With a ZPM now powering the city,

01:55.456 --> 02:00.525
we've been reactivating dormant systems. That one
tracked the location of Ancient ships during the war.

02:00.560 --> 02:01.423
A warship.

02:01.458 --> 02:03.967
See, look at his eyes, all
lighting up again. It's Pavlovian.

02:04.002 --> 02:09.225
I crosschecked the logs. They
were on a reconnaissance mission.

02:09.259 --> 02:12.211
When we activated the ZPM, the
city must have sent out some kind

02:12.246 --> 02:15.462
of automated subspace beacon,
recalling ships back to Atlantis.

02:15.497 --> 02:17.298
How long before it gets here?

02:17.333 --> 02:22.998
Well, given that it's at the edge of the
Pegasus Galaxy, let's see, carry the four....

02:23.033 --> 02:26.370
42,000,000 years. Shall
we go wait on the porch?

02:26.405 --> 02:30.230
So we take a Jumper through the
nearest stargate and check it out.

02:30.265 --> 02:31.801
Clever, but wrong.

02:31.836 --> 02:33.915
There are no nearby stargates.

02:33.950 --> 02:35.461
Uh, not within Jumper distance, no.

02:35.496 --> 02:38.482
Which leaves us only
one way to get there.

02:42.459 --> 02:45.996
Please don't force me to remind you that I do
have discretionary power to utilize the Daedalus...

02:46.031 --> 02:48.970
I'm well aware of the extent of your powers,
Dr Weir and they end at the hatch of this ship!

02:49.005 --> 02:51.068
col, do we have to?

02:51.103 --> 02:54.042
Relax Dr, I happen to agree. The value
of an Ancient warship in our hands,

02:54.077 --> 02:56.247
instead of the Wraith, is more
than enough incentive for me.

02:56.282 --> 02:58.585
Good. Col Sheppard's
team is ready to go.

02:58.620 --> 03:00.145
My crew can handle this.

03:00.786 --> 03:03.027
My team is far more experienced
with Ancient technology.

03:03.062 --> 03:06.554
My people will only get that kind of
experience, by going on this kind of a mission.

03:06.589 --> 03:11.796
Not this mission. We discovered it. We check it
out. Your crew can cut their teeth on something else.

03:12.702 --> 03:15.423
Fine! Have col Sheppard's
team ready to go in an hour.

03:17.238 --> 03:18.629
They're ready now.

04:35.970 --> 04:37.129
We should have visual soon.

04:46.483 --> 04:48.483
Sir! Detecting a second ship.

04:53.822 --> 04:57.897
Move! Looks like a small Wraith vessel.

04:57.932 --> 04:58.934
Dart?

04:58.969 --> 05:00.448
No, bigger. Some sort of a scout ship?

05:00.483 --> 05:03.366
It's altering course.
Coming straight at us.

05:03.401 --> 05:04.936
Must have seen us drop out of hyperspace

05:04.971 --> 05:07.053
Weapons range?

05:07.088 --> 05:09.034
Five seconds.

05:14.788 --> 05:16.396
Target is locked!

05:16.431 --> 05:17.174
Fire!

05:24.486 --> 05:25.656
Target is destroyed.

05:27.435 --> 05:29.129
All these years and just now
the Wraith find this ship?

05:29.164 --> 05:31.109
All these years, the Aurora lay dormant.

05:37.624 --> 05:39.588
Is that it?

05:52.620 --> 05:54.121
Looks like it was in a hell of a fight.

05:55.489 --> 05:56.606
And lost.

05:57.387 --> 05:58.398
Life support?

05:59.064 --> 06:00.133
Negative sir.

06:00.429 --> 06:02.924
Looks like you're gonna
have to suit up, col.

06:02.959 --> 06:04.279
On our way.

06:13.568 --> 06:14.861
Should be just outside the bridge.

06:37.587 --> 06:38.880
You mean, what used to be the bridge.

06:42.274 --> 06:43.258
col Sheppard?

07:14.166 --> 07:17.221
Stasis pods. They're still powered up.

07:18.195 --> 07:19.608
Stasis?

07:19.913 --> 07:26.185
We found a similar pod in Atlantis. It keeps a person
alive for many years in a type of frozen hybernation.

07:27.009 --> 07:28.545
Yeah, if you call that living.

07:28.754 --> 07:31.265
This ones uniform is different
from the others. Maybe the Captain?

07:31.300 --> 07:32.889
Or the Maitre D.

07:34.674 --> 07:39.356
Life sign indicators are active. These
capsules must have some kind of a shielding.

07:39.391 --> 07:41.546
That's why the Daedalus' sensors
were unable to pick them up.

07:42.895 --> 07:44.076
Look at all of them.

07:47.468 --> 07:51.051
That's just on this deck. Who knows how
many more there are on the rest of this ship.

07:52.753 --> 07:56.010
Look, our time in these suits is limited.
Can you get life support up and running?

07:56.346 --> 07:57.114
I'm on it.

08:16.703 --> 08:19.891
They're all alive? The entire crew?

08:19.926 --> 08:24.688
Well! They're in a kind
of suspended animation.

08:26.561 --> 08:33.371
Not entirely suspended, however. The pod has slowed their
ageing considerably, but the bodies are virtually moribund.

08:33.405 --> 08:37.698
Teyla and Ronon are searching the rest of
the ship. My guess is, there's hundreds.

08:38.562 --> 08:39.909
Is there anything we can do for them?

08:40.491 --> 08:44.282
Well, reviving them's out of the question. Look,
the pod's the only thing keeping them alive!

08:44.317 --> 08:47.241
What are we gonna do with them then?

08:47.276 --> 08:49.712
Wait.

08:51.116 --> 08:51.928
What?

08:54.461 --> 09:00.262
There's something going on! This pod is
magnetically shielded! I'm reading cortical signals.

09:00.297 --> 09:01.536
Which means?

09:01.571 --> 09:07.906
The pod's equipped with a neural interface. It's indicating a
definite brain activity, as though he were perfectly conscious.

09:09.398 --> 09:14.259
If all of these pods are interconnected, it's highly possible
that these people, are in fact, communicating with each other.

09:15.144 --> 09:16.850
This has been going on for 10,000 years?

09:17.500 --> 09:20.502
Possibly. It's a way of keeping their
minds occupied until they were rescued.

09:21.581 --> 09:23.115
One long conversation.

09:23.150 --> 09:27.422
Yeah well, more likely, the interface was reactivated
when the recall beacon from Atlantis was received.

09:27.457 --> 09:30.169
Either way, the neural feedback
loop is incredibly active.

09:30.204 --> 09:31.891
Any way to figure out
what they're saying?

09:32.801 --> 09:37.879
Yes of course, it says right here! 'Why is the smart
one having to stop and answer so many questions?'

09:39.010 --> 09:40.401
It's a fair question, Doctor.

09:40.436 --> 09:45.606
Of course it is! Being able to communicate with
a living Ancient is the opportunity of a lifetime!

09:45.641 --> 09:50.939
But this system is a highly complex
system, which I will have.....Wait a minute!

09:50.974 --> 09:51.871
What?

09:51.906 --> 09:53.344
Answering your question.

09:53.379 --> 09:55.793
Teyla! Found any more of the pods?

09:55.828 --> 09:59.152
Yes, many. And there are many
more decks we have yet to search.

09:59.187 --> 10:00.984
Are any of the pods empty?

10:01.019 --> 10:02.060
A few.

10:02.095 --> 10:03.318
Perfect.

10:10.496 --> 10:11.875
You sure this is such a good idea?

10:12.533 --> 10:14.527
What's the matter, col? Don't trust me?

10:15.489 --> 10:16.526
No!

10:17.509 --> 10:18.601
Fine!

10:18.636 --> 10:21.480
You're proposing actually freezing
yourself in one of those things?

10:21.515 --> 10:25.559
I should be able to tap into the neural
network without actually initialising stasis.

10:25.594 --> 10:28.188
Look, it won't take
long. I'll be in and out.

10:31.927 --> 10:34.653
Look, the quickest way to figure out what
is going on is to to tap into the system and

10:34.688 --> 10:40.011
communicate directly with the Captain. Need
I remind you of the obvious value in this.

10:40.651 --> 10:41.868
But is it safe?

10:41.903 --> 10:43.901
Would I be volunteering
to go if it wasn't?

10:43.936 --> 10:45.713
No.

10:45.748 --> 10:48.762
Which is exactly what makes
it safe enough for me to go.

10:48.797 --> 10:50.263
What?

10:50.298 --> 10:52.330
Better to have you on the outside,
in case something goes wrong.

10:52.365 --> 10:53.361
It won't!

10:53.396 --> 10:54.069
But if it does.

10:54.104 --> 10:55.967
It won't! How many times
do I have to say this?

10:56.002 --> 11:00.970
Rodney. Between the two of you, if something
were to go wrong? Which would be the greater loss?

11:01.005 --> 11:06.929
Well I've never thought of it that way,
but...Hey, she's right! You should go.

11:14.135 --> 11:18.728
Now, remember. The system creates a direct feedback
loop between the processor and your brainwaves,

11:18.763 --> 11:22.596
so, when you wanna disconnect, you'll
need to uh, well, really concentrate.

11:23.442 --> 11:24.302
You mean, think it.

11:24.337 --> 11:26.143
Well I think it'll probably
take a little bit more than that,

11:26.178 --> 11:28.445
otherwise you'd be popping in and out of
the thing, every time it crossed your mind.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.907
So, there's no place like home?

11:30.942 --> 11:36.993
If that works for you. Now, I should be able to monitor
your EEG patterns, so that in the highly unlikely

11:37.028 --> 11:41.472
event that something anomalous should present itself,
I should be able to uh, disconnect you manually.

11:41.507 --> 11:42.037
Good!

11:42.967 --> 11:44.379
Without PERMANENT brain damage.

11:45.923 --> 11:46.803
Rodney?

11:46.838 --> 11:49.477
Well, the opportunity to speak to a
living Ancient is worth the risk, hmmm?

11:49.512 --> 11:53.783
Now, when I close the lid, the
pod system should activate. Ready?

11:53.818 --> 11:56.058
I WAS.

11:56.093 --> 11:58.062
Good.

12:16.948 --> 12:18.591
This is wierd.

12:31.568 --> 12:32.485
Who are you?

12:32.875 --> 12:36.439
Lt col John Sheppard.
Part of an expedition...

12:36.474 --> 12:39.411
This deck is restricted.
How did you get in here?

12:39.446 --> 12:44.817
My team discovered your ship. Your crew was
in a stasis pod. We decided to tap in....

12:44.852 --> 12:47.620
Stay where you are.
Security to engineering deck!

12:48.136 --> 12:49.178
You don't need to call security.

12:49.213 --> 12:50.985
Stay where you are.

13:13.770 --> 13:16.303
The hyperdrive construct
modifications are commencing sir.

13:17.055 --> 13:22.133
Make certain the equations are entered in the correct
sequence. You don't wanna overload the control conduit.

13:22.645 --> 13:23.677
Yes sir.

13:24.598 --> 13:25.524
Is this him?

13:25.559 --> 13:26.454
Yes sir.

13:28.289 --> 13:30.704
You wear the uniform of my
crew, but I don't know you.

13:31.666 --> 13:37.750
My name's Lt Col John Sheppard. We discovered your
ship. We found you and your crew in the stasis pods.

13:37.785 --> 13:41.157
We decided to tap into the system
in order to communicate with you.

13:45.539 --> 13:47.008
System?

13:48.954 --> 13:53.221
This! This uh, virtual reality.

13:57.362 --> 13:59.811
You do know this is kinda, simulated?

14:10.185 --> 14:13.030
Is there somewhere more
private we could talk?

14:17.166 --> 14:19.289
It's not exactly what
I meant by private.

14:19.783 --> 14:21.999
I wanna know who you are and
how you got aboard this ship.

14:22.482 --> 14:25.550
I told you. My name's Col John
Sheppard. Part of an expedition.....

14:25.585 --> 14:27.035
What expedition?

14:27.861 --> 14:34.038
Let me bottom line this for you. We came from Atlantis.
Except it's not quite the Atlantis ou remember.

14:34.073 --> 14:40.358
10,000 years have gone by since you left. Look, I know
all this sounds strange, but I'm telling you the truth.

14:40.393 --> 14:45.856
Right now, you're all in your uh, stasis pods,
aboard Aurora. The ship's been derelict for centuries.

14:45.891 --> 14:48.836
None of this is real. I
expected you to know that.

14:49.209 --> 14:54.001
You don't have time to bother with this nonsense. The
hyperdrive modifications are much more pressing, sir.

14:54.036 --> 14:56.721
What kind of hyperdrive modifications?

14:56.756 --> 15:02.244
We're attempting to modify our propulsion, in
order to return to Atlantis as quickly as possible.

15:02.953 --> 15:04.339
Then we'll see if you're
speaking the truth.

15:04.374 --> 15:10.844
Oh, look. The Atlantis you know doesn't exist
anymore. They're in a war with the Wraith.

15:10.879 --> 15:12.799
The city was evacuated back to Earth.

15:12.834 --> 15:14.334
Evacuated? Why would we do that?

15:14.369 --> 15:17.465
Sure. The war was lost.

15:17.500 --> 15:23.951
Nothing is lost. Not yet! I have vital information
concerning a weakness in Wraith technology

15:23.986 --> 15:29.070
and when I deliver the communicae in my possession,
the tide will most certainly turn in our favour.

15:29.105 --> 15:32.527
That's right. The Atlantis mission
log said you were on a recon mission.

15:32.562 --> 15:35.928
What, what, what kind of
weakness are we talking about?

15:35.963 --> 15:38.637
That information is
reserved for the council.

15:38.672 --> 15:40.291
There is no council anymore!

15:40.326 --> 15:42.319
Sir, we must return to the bridge.

15:42.354 --> 15:47.164
Wait! According to the logs, the Aurora
left Lantian space during the Siege.

15:47.199 --> 15:49.830
That means the city had already
been sunk to the bottom of the ocean.

15:52.108 --> 15:54.455
You're wondering, how could I know that?

15:54.490 --> 15:55.676
Yes.

15:55.711 --> 15:58.040
Because that's where
it was when we found it!

15:58.075 --> 16:01.357
We're wasting time, sir. You
need to attend to the hyperdrive.

16:03.919 --> 16:09.970
Wait! The information in that communicae,
could still be incredibly valuable to us!

16:13.224 --> 16:14.786
Oh.

16:36.871 --> 16:37.952
So?

16:38.330 --> 16:38.997
It worked.

16:39.032 --> 16:45.186
Well of course it worked! Ah, for a minute, I thought
I was gonna get stuck there. Where's Teyla and Ronon?

16:45.221 --> 16:47.451
Well, Caldwell sent them to
search the ship's armoury.

16:47.486 --> 16:48.130
Yeah?

16:48.165 --> 16:51.868
No. Unfortunately it was depleted of drones. Look, so, what
happened? Were you able to communicate with the Captain?

16:51.903 --> 16:56.093
Face to face, pretty impressive in there and
they have a whole virtual reality thing going on.

16:56.128 --> 16:58.364
Actually, the correct term
is virtual environment.

16:58.399 --> 16:59.333
Yeah, whatever.

16:59.368 --> 17:00.512
So, what did you find out?

17:00.547 --> 17:02.398
For starters, I have to go back.

17:03.697 --> 17:04.877
What do you mean you have to go back?

17:04.913 --> 17:09.638
The Aurora was on a recon. The Captain
was carrying a communicae back to Atlantis.

17:09.674 --> 17:12.694
In it, is vital information about
a weakness in Wraith technology.

17:13.506 --> 17:14.583
What kind of weakness?

17:14.617 --> 17:17.170
Well, that's why I have to
go back. He didn't tell me.

17:17.204 --> 17:20.588
He's trying to modify the hyperdrives, in order
to get back to Atlantis faster, to deliver it.

17:20.623 --> 17:23.462
Well, did you mention that that's impossible,
given that they're living in a virtual environment?

17:23.497 --> 17:25.340
No, Rodney, that slipped my mind.

17:25.881 --> 17:27.569
Well, I would have thought that
would have been the first thing....

17:27.604 --> 17:30.910
Of course I mentioned it! They don't
remember putting themselves in stasis.

17:30.945 --> 17:34.340
Consequently, they had no idea
who I was or how I got there.

17:35.310 --> 17:36.843
Well why would the pods do that?

17:36.878 --> 17:39.791
That's a good question and another reason
I should go back. What do you think, col?

17:41.242 --> 17:42.108
Go!

17:51.051 --> 17:54.261
Hello! Anybody there?

17:57.131 --> 17:59.949
Hi. I really need to
talk to the Captain.

18:01.375 --> 18:02.324
Why?

18:03.895 --> 18:06.057
Tell him I'm ready to
make a full confession.

18:18.487 --> 18:19.511
Dr McKay?

18:19.546 --> 18:20.285
Go ahead.

18:20.320 --> 18:22.853
Long range sensors have just detected
two Wraith Cruisers heading this way.

18:22.888 --> 18:25.451
No doubt coming to investigate why
their scout ship was destroyed earlier.

18:26.102 --> 18:26.841
What's their ETA?

18:26.876 --> 18:29.533
A little over an hour and I plan on being
long gone by then. What's the status there?

18:30.354 --> 18:34.196
I, I've been able to decipher some more of the
program. I'm actually reading neural tracking signatures

18:34.231 --> 18:36.733
of the entire crew as they make
their way through the uh.....

18:36.768 --> 18:38.549
I meant col Sheppards status?

18:38.754 --> 18:41.347
Oh him! Uh, yeah well,
he's, he's still in the pod.

18:41.382 --> 18:45.092
Understood. Just be aware of the time
constraints with the Wraith ships approaching.

18:45.127 --> 18:46.517
We can't risk being discovered.

18:46.552 --> 18:48.364
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Ticking clock. Anything else?

18:48.399 --> 18:51.862
If he's not out of their in thirty
minutes? Disconnect him manually.

19:03.201 --> 19:03.898
Where's the Captain?

19:03.933 --> 19:07.323
He's got more pressing concerns at
the moment. He sent me in his stead.

19:09.180 --> 19:11.336
I was told you were ready
to make a full confession?

19:11.371 --> 19:20.007
Yeah, well, no. Actually um, I just wanted to talk to
him and try to convince him that we're on the same side.

19:21.261 --> 19:24.865
Perhaps you would have more success
if your story were not so preposterous.

19:25.458 --> 19:27.157
It's not preposterous.

19:27.192 --> 19:29.411
You say you're from Atlantis.

19:29.446 --> 19:30.103
Yes.

19:30.138 --> 19:32.767
And yet you also say that
Atlantis has been evacuated.

19:32.802 --> 19:40.503
Yes. Well, it was. 10,000 years ago.
Look, we just discovered it last year.

19:41.243 --> 19:42.530
You discovered it.

19:42.565 --> 19:45.485
We came from Earth. We found
the city deserted. We set a base.

19:45.520 --> 19:50.141
Been living there ever since. That's how we found you.
We saw the Aurora on one of the city's long range sensors.

19:50.176 --> 19:54.302
Even after all these years, the Wraith
are still causing a lot of problems.

19:54.337 --> 20:00.441
We managed to hold them off for now, but uh, we could sure
use that information about the weakness in their technology.

20:00.476 --> 20:03.045
Only the Captain has
access to the communicae.

20:03.080 --> 20:08.538
Well then, let me talk to him. I can deliver the message myself.
The quicker it gets back to Atlantis, the better for all of us.

20:10.759 --> 20:12.127
You seem sincere.

20:12.162 --> 20:15.946
Yes, I am. Very sincere. I
would be very, very grateful.

20:21.492 --> 20:22.592
Ah!

20:25.896 --> 20:27.305
I'll speak to him for you.

20:44.326 --> 20:44.584
Ow.

20:44.932 --> 20:46.406
More of the same!

20:46.441 --> 20:50.502
Shhhh! I am counting. I do
not want to lose my place.

20:50.537 --> 20:58.481
I counted 376. No wait! 398. I forgot about the
infirmary. There's 22 in there. Or is it 23? Sorry.

21:10.223 --> 21:11.401
Where did she come from?

21:26.306 --> 21:27.786
Oh no.

21:28.635 --> 21:30.028
Dr McKay?

21:30.063 --> 21:30.888
Still here.

21:30.923 --> 21:33.709
There's something you need to see.
We are two decks directly below you.

21:33.744 --> 21:34.915
Can't it wait?

21:34.950 --> 21:35.858
No!

21:44.977 --> 21:46.418
Guard!

21:51.647 --> 21:53.289
I need to talk to the First Officer.

21:53.324 --> 21:55.268
She gave orders not to be disturbed.

21:55.303 --> 21:59.020
It's okay! She said she was going to talk to
the Captain for me. It's been a while, so....

21:59.055 --> 22:00.583
She also gave orders to
ignore everything you say.

22:03.805 --> 22:05.530
Then why are you
talking to me right now?

22:11.096 --> 22:12.759
I need to see the Captain!

22:24.839 --> 22:28.041
Alright. That should be enough time.

22:39.146 --> 22:41.005
Give me this thing.

22:45.272 --> 22:48.506
I really don't like being ignored.

22:54.303 --> 22:55.073
What is it?

22:55.108 --> 22:56.364
Have a look.

23:02.017 --> 23:05.181
This is Wraith gear and
it's recently installed.

23:06.622 --> 23:07.877
There's a reason for that.

23:20.881 --> 23:21.640
Are there any more?

23:21.675 --> 23:24.229
Well it's hard to say, since you plucked
us out of there the second you heard.

23:24.264 --> 23:27.385
Ronon and I have searched the ship.
I am certain there is only one.

23:27.420 --> 23:34.785
The Wraith tied into the same neural feedback as the crew and col Sheppard
and by the looks of it, they must have found Aurora a long time ago.

23:34.820 --> 23:38.061
Certainly long enough to figure out how
to access and reconfigure the system.

23:38.096 --> 23:41.842
Given their apparent psychic abilities,
is it possible the Wraith ships on the way

23:41.877 --> 23:43.869
are in communication with
the Wraith aboard the Aurora?

23:43.904 --> 23:45.323
No. They need to be closer.

23:45.358 --> 23:48.443
She's right. We've already determined that the
range of the Wraith psychic ability is limited.

23:48.478 --> 23:50.878
So we can't risk those ships
getting within that range.

23:50.913 --> 23:52.923
I say we go back and kill it, right now.

23:52.958 --> 23:53.921
I agree.

23:53.956 --> 23:57.175
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop! Let's not get all trigger happy.

23:57.210 --> 23:59.746
We have no idea how much of the
system this Wraith is manipulating!

23:59.781 --> 24:02.774
We need to figure out what is going
on, before we start shooting things!

24:02.809 --> 24:04.559
For all we know, that
could kill Sheppard.

24:04.594 --> 24:05.695
What's he still doing there?

24:05.730 --> 24:09.166
He can come out any time he
wants. There must be a good reason.

24:09.201 --> 24:11.979
Knowing Sheppard, he wouldn't leave without
getting that information from the Communicae.

24:12.014 --> 24:13.174
I still don't like it.

24:13.209 --> 24:15.933
The Wraith cannot physically
harm him in there, can it?

24:15.968 --> 24:22.192
No...I don't think so. I don't
know, but what I do know is,

24:22.227 --> 24:24.264
I should get back in there and
learn what this Wraith is doing.

24:24.299 --> 24:26.385
You've got fifteen minutes
to figure it out, Doctor.

24:26.420 --> 24:30.057
Fifteen? Where do you people come
up with these arbitrary numbers?

24:30.092 --> 24:32.822
That's the time you've got to
learn what you need to, Doctor.

24:32.857 --> 24:33.667
Why?

24:33.702 --> 24:36.724
Because I intend to destroy the Aurora
before those Wraith ships get here.

24:39.789 --> 24:40.531
Ok.

24:56.829 --> 24:57.879
Hi. Me again.

24:58.933 --> 25:07.678
Wait, wait, please. Just listen. I'm not here
to hurt anyone. I wanna help you. Help all of us.

25:09.513 --> 25:13.973
I know all this sounds strange, but just give
me a chance to prove that what I am saying...

25:15.766 --> 25:16.995
Are you alright, sir?

25:17.030 --> 25:18.437
Yes, I'm fine.

25:18.472 --> 25:20.174
Take him back to the brig.

25:26.252 --> 25:29.606
He escaped only moments ago. I'll see
to it he doesn't disturb you again.

25:31.092 --> 25:42.497
What if he is telling the truth? Do you
not sense it, too? That something is wrong?

25:43.506 --> 25:45.026
You're exhausted sir.

25:46.153 --> 25:55.991
True. I am in need of rest.
Even more so, are my crew.

25:57.606 --> 26:03.929
Rest is a luxury we cannot afford, sir. The Aurora
is a fine ship, but she was never built for speed.

26:04.856 --> 26:08.245
Without the drive modifications, it'll
take months to return to Atlantis.

26:08.847 --> 26:12.420
If we are to use this new intelligence to our
advantage, we need to reach the city within days.

26:15.140 --> 26:17.288
Then there'll be time for rest.

26:17.323 --> 26:18.580
Yes sir.

26:31.003 --> 26:32.054
What is wrong?

26:32.720 --> 26:33.676
Delta waves?

26:34.094 --> 26:34.952
What are they?

26:35.345 --> 26:37.361
Dr McKay. Are you ready to beam aboard?

26:37.396 --> 26:39.160
It hasn't even been five minutes!

26:39.195 --> 26:41.181
Dr McKay has discovered a problem.

26:41.941 --> 26:43.028
What kind of a problem?

26:43.063 --> 26:45.205
Col Sheppard's EEG
frequencies are decreasing.

26:45.240 --> 26:48.422
I'm reading delta waves, which indicate that
he's unconscious within the virtual environment.

26:48.457 --> 26:51.326
I'm not sure how it happened, but
something is definitely wrong in there.

26:51.361 --> 26:53.042
Even more reason to pull him out.

26:53.077 --> 26:58.508
That would be a mistake! Look, additional data I've been
able to decipher from the Wraith's biometric receiver,

26:58.543 --> 27:03.537
shows significant manipulation of the feedback loop.
Something we were clearly not aware of when Sheppard went in.

27:03.572 --> 27:06.457
We were also clearly not aware that
two Wraith Cruisers approach it.

27:06.492 --> 27:10.683
Col! This Wraith is controlling the program,
which means it might have booby trapped it as well.

27:10.718 --> 27:12.595
We're talking about
Sheppard's life here!

27:12.630 --> 27:15.904
And I'm talking about the lives of not only every
person aboard this ship, but every person in Atlantis,

27:15.939 --> 27:20.207
when the Wraith find out it wasn't destroyed.
I'm well aware of what's at stake here, Doctor.

27:20.242 --> 27:24.273
Get him out of that pod, or
my men will. Caldwell out.

27:29.711 --> 27:33.597
I'm going in. Look, stall Caldwell. Buy me
some time. Just a few minutes at the most.

27:34.133 --> 27:35.361
What if you are unable to disconnect?

27:35.396 --> 27:37.872
Caldwell's gonna blow that ship,
whether you're in there or not.

27:37.907 --> 27:42.546
You see, the thing is, col Sheppard and I have gotten into
this habit of saving each others lives, and it's my turn.

27:46.050 --> 27:53.349
It could be your turn next. Look, hit this to manually
disconnnect me. If I do not regain consciousness, go ahead and

27:53.384 --> 27:58.697
open col Sheppard's pod. Have us beamed directly to
Daedalus and make sure they have a medical team waiting.

28:01.976 --> 28:03.317
Are you sure you wanna do this?

28:03.352 --> 28:13.430
I'm sure I don't. Ok. Alright. There's
more than enough air in there. Alright.

28:13.465 --> 28:16.851
Course there is. The crew's been sealed
inside these things for thousands of years.

28:17.446 --> 28:18.267
Are you alright?

28:18.302 --> 28:24.714
Yeah. It's just my claustrophobia. I'll be fine. I
hope. Now, the system should engage, once you send me in.

28:24.749 --> 28:26.031
Alright.

28:26.066 --> 28:26.960
Right.

28:31.453 --> 28:32.342
So, send me in?

28:32.377 --> 28:34.356
Oh yes! Good luck.

28:34.391 --> 28:36.703
Right.

28:48.695 --> 28:52.775
Where are you taking me? I have told you, I am with col
Sheppard! I'm a member of his team. Col John Sheppard?

28:52.810 --> 28:57.891
He's about, he's about, so high. He has brown
hair, a bit mushed. Could be termed as rakish?

28:57.926 --> 28:59.352
Ah for...

28:59.387 --> 29:00.966
McKay!

29:01.001 --> 29:02.099
What are you doing in there?

29:02.134 --> 29:04.675
I was about to ask you the same thing.

29:04.710 --> 29:05.955
I, I came to help you.

29:05.990 --> 29:07.581
I feel better already.

29:23.662 --> 29:29.186
10,000 years aboard one of these things? Kept alive
only by life support? I couldn't live that way.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.186
Neither could I.

29:31.221 --> 29:32.755
Dr McKay, what's your status?

29:34.580 --> 29:37.623
Dr McKay is not here.

29:37.658 --> 29:38.692
What?

29:38.727 --> 29:40.082
He had to...

29:40.117 --> 29:41.991
He had to check something
on the Wraith pod.

29:42.026 --> 29:44.135
Yes. The Wraith pod.

29:44.170 --> 29:50.201
He had to check the biometrics receiver, needed to
reconfirm the frequencies of the neural feedback loop.

29:50.236 --> 29:51.673
Why isn't he on his radio?

29:52.993 --> 29:56.544
Well actually, we have been having
trouble reaching him ourselves.

29:56.579 --> 30:05.227
I think it might have something to do with interference
from the um, magnetic shielding of the pods.

30:05.262 --> 30:06.646
Yes, shielding.

30:06.681 --> 30:09.897
Ronon was just about to go and check
on him. See what is taking him so long.

30:09.932 --> 30:12.059
Alright, go get him.
Light a fire under him.

30:13.831 --> 30:15.195
Right away.

30:15.230 --> 30:18.102
I want a status report as soon as
his radio's working. Caldwell out.

30:19.284 --> 30:20.423
Nice going.

30:22.804 --> 30:24.616
Have you been unable to disconnect
yourself from the system?

30:24.651 --> 30:27.215
No. I'm still trying to get the
information on that communicae.

30:27.250 --> 30:30.157
Oh good. We thought maybe it was
preventing your from exiting the program.

30:30.192 --> 30:31.170
It?

30:32.282 --> 30:36.514
We found a Wraith in one of the stasis pods.
It's manipulating the neural feedback program.

30:36.549 --> 30:38.142
Your EEG patterns were irregular....

30:38.177 --> 30:39.570
You're not kidding. I got stung.

30:39.605 --> 30:41.257
I didn't wanna risk pulling
you out till I knew more.

30:41.292 --> 30:42.842
First Officer.

30:43.442 --> 30:44.099
What about him?

30:44.134 --> 30:46.197
She's a Wraith, she has to be.

30:46.232 --> 30:49.990
There's something odd about her and she keeps
preventing me from talking to the Captain.

30:50.025 --> 30:54.151
The Wraith we found was male. The First Officer
must have been female. It took her place.

30:54.186 --> 30:58.037
She knows I want that information and the
Captain's the only one with access to it.

30:58.072 --> 31:01.417
No, we don't need the Captain. I've been able to
decipher enough of the program to override the protocols.

31:01.452 --> 31:04.413
All I have to do is get to a terminal
within the virtual environment and

31:04.448 --> 31:07.202
I should be able to access any
file stored within the database.

31:07.237 --> 31:08.616
So we just need to break out of here.

31:08.651 --> 31:10.470
Hold that thought.

31:18.897 --> 31:19.907
What's happening?

31:19.942 --> 31:30.234
Give me the tablet. The data device right here! Right here.
Thankyou. That's it. Just keep stalling. Keep stalling.

31:54.019 --> 31:54.420
Hi!

31:55.022 --> 31:55.537
Hi.

31:55.949 --> 31:56.558
Nice.

32:04.179 --> 32:05.502
It should be the next hallway.

32:13.726 --> 32:15.085
That's her.

32:15.120 --> 32:16.699
That's the Wraith?

32:16.734 --> 32:17.678
Yeah.

32:17.713 --> 32:23.354
Wow! She's hot! I mean, seriously hot!

32:23.389 --> 32:25.155
Rodney, you're drooling over a Wraith.

32:26.452 --> 32:28.835
I know. I disgust myself sometimes.

32:52.380 --> 32:53.961
Where are Dr McKay and col Sheppard?

32:53.996 --> 32:55.043
Why'd you beam us back?

32:55.078 --> 32:57.104
Because I was about to fire a
missile into the side of that ship.

32:58.019 --> 32:59.739
They're in the pods.

33:04.684 --> 33:05.912
They're both in pods,

33:05.947 --> 33:12.957
Yes, Dr McKay went in to see what was preventing
col Sheppard from disengaging the system.

33:14.443 --> 33:18.999
I want a team assembled, ready to beam aboard
the Aurora todisconnect Dr McKay and col Sheppard.

33:19.034 --> 33:23.159
No, wait! Please. Just
a few more minutes.

33:23.194 --> 33:25.135
ETA on the Wraith ships?

33:25.170 --> 33:26.502
Eleven minutes out.

33:26.537 --> 33:28.087
I am certain he will be out by then.

33:28.122 --> 33:31.146
And if he is successful, he will know
if it is safe to disconnect col Sheppard.

33:31.181 --> 33:33.171
And if he's not out by then?

33:33.206 --> 33:35.026
Then we'll disconnect them both.

33:37.271 --> 33:40.399
It would be wise to have a medical
team standing by for both of them.

33:45.629 --> 33:47.950
Alert the infirmary. I want
medical teams standing by.

33:53.445 --> 33:54.605
The communicae's been erased.

33:54.640 --> 33:56.941
Why would the Wraith do that?

33:57.905 --> 34:01.875
All it say's right here. The Wraith delete this
important information to keep you from seeing it.

34:01.910 --> 34:06.576
Obviously he did it to keep us from seeing
it, but why didn't it end the damn program?

34:06.611 --> 34:08.657
What's the point of continuing?

34:08.692 --> 34:09.953
Oh no!

34:09.987 --> 34:10.733
What?

34:12.571 --> 34:14.958
You said they were trying
to modify the hyperdrive.

34:14.993 --> 34:17.246
So they can get back to Atlantis faster.

34:17.282 --> 34:21.255
Well, according to the Atlantis database,
there are two types of Ancient hyperdrives.

34:21.291 --> 34:26.911
There's the more basic interstellar kind, like the one the
Aurora has and then there's the more powerful intergalactic kind.

34:26.946 --> 34:29.829
Similar to the one the Asgard
provided us for the Daedalus.

34:29.864 --> 34:32.322
Why would the Wraith wanna
soup up the Aurora's hyperdrive?

34:32.357 --> 34:35.858
Because the Wraith hyperdrives are nowhere
near as advanced as the Ancient hyperdrives.

34:35.893 --> 34:38.830
God, with the technology the
Captain is feeding her right now...

34:38.864 --> 34:42.313
She'll learn how to modify the Wraith
hyperdrives from interstellar to intergalactic.

34:43.766 --> 34:45.266
Which means they'll
make it as far as Earth.

34:45.302 --> 34:49.570
That's what this whole thing is about. Their
new feeding ground. And this is just step one.

34:49.605 --> 34:53.844
Even if she doesn't have all the
information she needs, we need to stop her

34:53.879 --> 34:56.899
from sending what she's learned so far,
to the Wraith ships that are on the way.

34:56.934 --> 34:58.909
There are Wraith ships on the way?

35:00.211 --> 35:01.797
I'm, I'm sure I mentioned that.

35:01.832 --> 35:03.368
No you didn't.

35:03.403 --> 35:06.926
Well it, it, it, it threw
me when she was so hot.

35:06.961 --> 35:08.367
How many ships?

35:08.402 --> 35:10.068
It's two Cruisers.

35:10.103 --> 35:12.897
Can you disconnect her?

35:13.921 --> 35:19.629
Him. Not from the inside, no. I should be able
to disable the pod interface from the outside.

35:19.664 --> 35:20.821
Then why didn't you?

35:20.856 --> 35:23.146
Because I didn't know
what that would do to YOU.

35:23.181 --> 35:25.862
Well that's very thoughtful of you,
but now she knows all about Atlantis.

35:25.897 --> 35:28.317
You told her? Why?

35:28.352 --> 35:37.761
Because I was trying to convince them that....Just
go and unplug the Wraith, while I talk to the Captain.

35:37.796 --> 35:39.104
The communicae is blank!

35:39.139 --> 35:41.291
Yeah, but he might still have some
intel about the Wraith weakness.

35:41.326 --> 35:43.958
Now Rodney, is there anything
else you'd like to tell me.

35:46.379 --> 35:49.100
Only that Caldwell is probably going
to destroy this ship at any moment.

35:50.822 --> 35:52.282
Go!!

35:52.317 --> 35:53.732
Going!

36:04.569 --> 36:11.050
Teyla! Ronon? Oh, I don't believe it.
Two minutes in the pod, I'm abandoned.

36:11.085 --> 36:18.557
But I'm up. Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go. Right. Ok.

36:18.592 --> 36:20.711
Come on, McKay!

36:36.294 --> 36:40.963
Hyperdrive modification commands have been
successfully entered. Auxillary power is now online.

36:40.998 --> 36:43.310
Very good. Prepare to engage drive.

36:43.345 --> 36:47.299
Stop! Your First Officer's
a Wraith. She's using you.

36:47.334 --> 36:48.878
Security to the bridge.

36:48.913 --> 36:53.044
She gained access to the virtual environment, by
killing your First Officer and taking her place.

36:53.079 --> 36:56.939
She's getting you to modify your hyperdrives,
so she can upgrade the Wraith hyperdrives.

36:56.974 --> 36:58.291
Don't listen to him.

36:58.326 --> 37:02.029
They need to modify their hyperdrives to make it
to my planet, Earth and I'd prefer she not do that.

37:02.064 --> 37:03.174
This is nonsense.

37:03.209 --> 37:04.410
I'm telling you she's Wraith.

37:04.445 --> 37:07.511
Officer Trevell has served with me for many
years. I can't possibly believe that she...

37:07.546 --> 37:11.200
Sir, with your permission
I'd like to throw....

37:16.398 --> 37:19.337
Come on! Disable!

37:38.139 --> 37:39.428
I hope that was proof enough.

37:46.189 --> 37:47.752
Oh no!

38:19.734 --> 38:21.325
Come on, come on!

38:30.013 --> 38:32.205
All this time, I thought
we had evaded the enemy.

38:32.240 --> 38:34.564
Instead, all this time I've
been unwittingly assisting them.

38:34.599 --> 38:38.397
No sir, she didn't succeed and if you
tell me the information in the communicae,

38:38.432 --> 38:40.951
we may be able to defeat
the Wraith once and for all.

38:40.986 --> 38:44.005
The information is in the ships
computer. I can give you my access codes.

38:44.040 --> 38:46.734
We checked, it's all been erased.
Can't you tell me yourself?

38:46.769 --> 38:51.496
No. I'm afraid I was never made aware of it's contents,
col Sheppard. The Council feared the possibility

38:51.531 --> 39:04.723
of our capture was too great. The information in that communicae
is gone. 10,000 years. Even in stasis, our physical bodies

39:04.758 --> 39:07.749
Very old. Too old.

39:14.349 --> 39:15.741
My crew deserves to know.

39:15.776 --> 39:18.980
Yes they do. And I'd love to give you
all the time in the world for that,

39:19.015 --> 39:21.236
but right now, there are
two Wraith ships on the way.

39:22.577 --> 39:33.159
We long for nothing more than returning to Atlantis. To
raise a toast to home and victory. We may not return home,

39:33.194 --> 39:38.478
but we will do whatever we can to ensure
that victory. For that I will need your help.

39:43.871 --> 39:46.363
Well it's about damn time! What'd you do? Play
a round of golf? We've got serious problems!

39:47.100 --> 39:48.654
What happened? Get down!

39:53.755 --> 39:57.401
Ah Ha! Not so hot now.

39:59.092 --> 40:06.931
My ships are coming. They will retrieve
what I have learned. Earth will soon be ours.

40:06.966 --> 40:08.707
Not if I can help it.

40:14.779 --> 40:17.570
Col Sheppard, we're reading two lifesigns.
I hope that means what I think it means.

40:17.605 --> 40:19.108
Give me one more minute.

40:19.143 --> 40:21.325
We're out of time, Sheppard.
The Wraith ships are almost here.

40:21.360 --> 40:23.775
One damn minute and I can
take care of that problem.

40:27.185 --> 40:30.185
Wraith Cruisers just dropped out of
hyperspace, sir. They're aware of us.

40:30.220 --> 40:35.788
Battle stations! Looks like we're gonna have
to fight these guys. Bring Rail Guns online.

40:35.823 --> 40:38.233
Daedalus, this is Sheppard. We're ready.

40:38.268 --> 40:40.406
Beam them directly onto the bridge.

40:46.319 --> 40:47.482
Targets are in range.

40:47.517 --> 40:48.723
Sir, we need to get outta here.

40:48.758 --> 40:50.560
No, we need to eliminate those
cruisers. The information...

40:50.595 --> 40:52.294
No, no, we need to get far away.

40:52.329 --> 40:53.020
What?

40:53.055 --> 40:54.738
The Captain gave me
Aurora's self destruct code.

40:54.773 --> 40:57.959
He assures me that it'll take care of the
Wraith ships too, but we have to get clear.

40:57.994 --> 40:59.862
Bring sublight engines
to military thrust.

40:59.897 --> 41:01.218
Military thrust.

41:09.011 --> 41:16.690
I have never been more proud than I am at this
moment. It has been an honour serving with you.

41:16.725 --> 41:25.160
And although we may not return to Atlantis,
rest assured that the Aurora WILL be remembered.

41:49.302 --> 41:53.296
We monitored all transmissions from the
Wraith Cruisers prior to the explosion.

41:53.331 --> 41:57.645
They never got a chance to board the Aurora
or upload any of the Ancient information.

41:57.680 --> 41:59.956
Both Cruisers were
destroyed in the explosion.

41:59.991 --> 42:02.333
It's too bad you weren't able to
figure out the Wraith weakness.

42:02.368 --> 42:04.028
At least we found out they had one.

42:04.063 --> 42:07.427
Good work. Thankyou, everyone.

42:07.462 --> 42:10.788
Uh, before we break up the party,
there's something I'd like to do.

42:12.190 --> 42:15.520
It might seem a little strange, but I
promised to do something when we got home.

42:41.202 --> 42:46.878
To the crew of the Aurora.
