WEBVTT

00:04.705 --> 00:05.473
THE TAPS ARE ALL
ORIGINAL BRASS.

00:05.506 --> 00:07.308
EVERYTHING
IN THIS BABY
IS ORIGINAL.

00:07.341 --> 00:08.242
YOU KNOW,
BUYIN' THIS BAR

00:08.276 --> 00:10.778
WOULD BE
THE BEST INVESTMENT
YOU EVER MADE.

00:10.811 --> 00:13.747
GREAT. WHAT TIME
DO YOU USUALLY OPEN?

00:13.781 --> 00:15.283
WE'RE OPEN.

00:15.316 --> 00:16.750
OH.

00:16.784 --> 00:18.352
WHERE, UM...

00:18.386 --> 00:19.253
WHERE ARE
YOUR CUSTOMERS?

00:19.287 --> 00:20.821
OH, YOU'RE NEW
TO THE TAVERN GAME.
YEAH.

00:20.854 --> 00:23.157
THIS ISN'T EXACTLY,
UH, PRIME TIME.

00:23.191 --> 00:24.825
IT'S 8:00
ON A FRIDAY NIGHT.

00:24.858 --> 00:28.462
YEAH. WE DEAL WITH
A LATER KIND OF CROWD,
MOSTLY EUROPEAN.

00:28.496 --> 00:29.497
AH, HERE WE GO.

00:29.530 --> 00:32.166
BONJOUR,
MADEMOISELLE.

00:32.200 --> 00:32.833
WHAT?

00:32.866 --> 00:33.734
WHAT CAN I GET
FOR YOU?

00:33.767 --> 00:34.568
I'M MEETING
THE CHEERLEADERS

00:34.602 --> 00:36.637
ACROSS THE STREET
AT TJ SHENANIGAN'S,

00:36.670 --> 00:37.771
AND I NEED SOME MONEY.

00:37.805 --> 00:40.541
WAIT. THERE'S--
THERE'S ANOTHER BAR
ACROSS THE STREET?

00:40.574 --> 00:42.710
I WOULDN'T REALLY
CALL IT A BAR.

00:42.743 --> 00:45.113
NO, IT'S
MUCH MORE THAN THAT.

00:45.146 --> 00:46.814
THERE'S AN ARCADE,
A BOWLING ALLEY,

00:46.847 --> 00:50.184
AND A CLIMBING WALL.
NOT THAT YOU CAN GET
TO ANY OF THAT.

00:50.218 --> 00:52.120
IT'S ALWAYS SO CROWDED.

00:52.153 --> 00:54.555
WHY DON'T YOU BRING
YOUR FRIENDS
OVER HERE?

00:56.490 --> 00:58.226
COULD I HAVE MONEY,
PLEASE?

01:00.194 --> 01:01.362
I DON'T HAVE ANY.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.696
CHECK THE REGISTER.

01:02.730 --> 01:05.299
YEAH, REGISTER'S
CLOSED.

01:05.333 --> 01:06.734
OH, MY GOD.

01:06.767 --> 01:09.170
YOU DON'T HAVE $10
IN YOUR REGISTER

01:09.203 --> 01:10.204
ON A FRIDAY NIGHT?

01:10.238 --> 01:11.639
YEAH, OF COURSE!

01:11.672 --> 01:14.242
OF COURSE
I'VE GOT $10.

01:14.275 --> 01:15.776
YEAH, I GOT $10.

01:15.809 --> 01:18.846
SEE? I GOT $10
RIGHT HERE.

01:19.247 --> 01:20.648
FRANK SINATRA
SIGNED THIS?

01:20.681 --> 01:21.649
HE SURE DID.

01:21.682 --> 01:23.817
If you spend that,
I will kill you.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.486
DAD!
GO!

01:25.519 --> 01:26.120
JUST GO. GO.

01:26.154 --> 01:28.122
PAUL, WE'RE
BOTH BUSY MEN.

01:28.156 --> 01:30.758
HMM? AND WE COULD
GO BACK AND FORTH

01:30.791 --> 01:33.161
WITH THIS DANCE OF OFFER
AND COUNTER-OFFER,

01:33.194 --> 01:36.330
SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO
IS I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
THE ROCK-BOTTOM PRICE

01:36.364 --> 01:39.933
FOR THIS BAR. OK?

01:43.804 --> 01:46.207
NO WAY.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.210
WHAT IF I WERE
TO CROSS OFF A ZERO?

01:49.243 --> 01:50.811
HEY. SEAN,
YOU HAVE ANY MONEY?
I'M GONNA MEET LENA

01:50.844 --> 01:52.045
AT TJ SHENANIGAN'S
FOR SOME DINNER.

01:52.079 --> 01:54.882
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!
PAUL, WHAT IF I MADE
THIS COMMA A DECIMAL?

01:54.915 --> 01:58.186
WHAT IF I SAY
"I'LL CALL YOU"?

01:59.187 --> 02:00.421
DAMN IT!

02:00.454 --> 02:01.222
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

02:01.255 --> 02:04.192
I ALMOST SOLD THE BAR
FOR 50 BUCKS.

02:04.225 --> 02:05.259
OH, COME ON.

02:05.293 --> 02:06.160
SERIOUSLY. I BET YOU

02:06.194 --> 02:07.127
HE WOULDN'T HAVE BOUGHT
IT FOR THAT, EVEN.

02:07.161 --> 02:09.363
HONEY, WHY DO YOU
BRING THESE PEOPLE
IN HERE

02:09.397 --> 02:10.664
WHEN YOU DON'T
HAVE ANY CUSTOMERS?

02:10.698 --> 02:11.932
I CAN'T CONTROL
THAT, BABE. OK?

02:11.965 --> 02:13.734
SOME NIGHTS,
IT'S, UH, YOU KNOW,

02:13.767 --> 02:14.568
THERE ARE VERY FEW
PEOPLE HERE,

02:14.602 --> 02:16.170
AND OTHER NIGHTS,
IT'S TOTALLY EMPTY.

02:16.204 --> 02:17.905
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN.
YOU NEED TO BE PATIENT.

02:17.938 --> 02:19.407
OK? SOMEBODY'S
GONNA BUY THIS PLACE.

02:19.440 --> 02:22.610
HEY, ED. WHAT'S
GOIN' ON, MAN?

02:22.643 --> 02:25.279
YOU REMEMBER
MY EX

02:25.313 --> 02:26.714
CRAZY AMY
OR TATTOO AMY?

02:26.747 --> 02:28.349
CRAZY AMY.
TATTOO AMY'S
STILL IN JAIL.

02:28.382 --> 02:30.818
YOU REMEMBER
THOSE NUDE PICTURES
SHE TOOK OF ME?

02:30.851 --> 02:32.420
WAIT. I THOUGHT
THEY BOTH DID THAT.

02:32.453 --> 02:35.856
ONLY ONE OF 'EM
DID THIS.

02:55.243 --> 02:57.645
WAIT. IS THAT
AT THE NEWSSTAND
ON 18th STREET?

02:57.678 --> 02:58.746
DON'T GO SEE THEM.

02:58.779 --> 02:59.580
OH, I'M NOT.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.315
I HAVE TO PLAN
AN ALTERNATE ROUTE HOME.

03:01.349 --> 03:02.850
I MEAN, YOU GOTTA
DO SOMETHIN', MAN.

03:02.883 --> 03:05.319
WELL, WHAT CAN I DO?
THE PICTURES ARE
OUT THERE ALREADY.

03:05.353 --> 03:07.621
YEAH, BUT WHAT
IF SHE TAKES 'EM
TO ANOTHER GALLERY

03:07.655 --> 03:08.689
OR MAKES
SOME KIND OF BOOK?

03:08.722 --> 03:10.958
I MEAN, THEN
EVERYBODY'S GONNA
HAVE SEEN YOU NAKED.

03:10.991 --> 03:11.992
WAIT. THERE'S STILL ME.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.428
AH. WHAT ABOUT
THE CAMPING TRIP?

03:14.862 --> 03:17.831
DAMN IT, SEAN.
I BLOCKED THAT
FOR 3 YEARS.

03:17.865 --> 03:18.632
I'M GONNA GO.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.301
ALL RIGHT.
CONFRONT HER.
SERIOUSLY.

03:20.334 --> 03:22.836
I COULD DO THAT,
BUT IT DEPENDS.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.238
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT?

03:24.272 --> 03:25.038
ON WHETHER
I'M WEARIN' A SHIRT

03:25.072 --> 03:27.941
THAT I DON'T MIND
BEING STABBED IN.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.359
HEY, BABE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:45.393 --> 03:46.460
OH, GOING THROUGH
ALL OUR OLD BABY STUFF

03:46.494 --> 03:48.829
AND GETTING RID
OF ANYTHING THAT'S
BEEN DISCONTINUED,

03:48.862 --> 03:51.732
RECALLED, OR BANNED.
HOW'S IT GOIN'?

03:51.765 --> 03:52.666
IT'D BE SAFER

03:52.700 --> 03:54.368
TO LET OUR BABY SLEEP
IN A DRY-CLEANING BAG.

03:54.402 --> 03:55.836
THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOME USABLE STUFF HERE.

03:55.869 --> 03:57.305
WHAT ABOUT THIS GUY?

03:57.338 --> 03:59.540
YOU MEAN SPLINTER
THE WONDER HORSE?

03:59.573 --> 04:00.608
OW! GOSH!

04:00.641 --> 04:02.676
OH, LOOK.
HENRY'S TEDDY.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.712
OH, THIS GUY'S SOFT.
HE SHOULD BE FINE.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.780
NO. HIS EYE'S LOOSE.
HE'S PROBABLY A CHOKING HAZARD.

04:06.814 --> 04:08.782
OH, WELL, I'LL
JUST PULL IT OUT. AH!

04:08.816 --> 04:12.920
OH, GROSS. WE'VE GOT
TO THROW OUT ALL THIS CRAP

04:12.953 --> 04:14.087
AND START OVER.

04:14.121 --> 04:16.056
THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOMETHIN' SAFE THAT
WON'T KILL OUR KID.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.392
I MEAN,
WHAT ABOUT THE WALKER?

04:18.426 --> 04:19.126
IT'S DANGEROUS.

04:19.159 --> 04:20.494
YOU CAN'T EVEN
GET THESE ANYMORE.

04:20.528 --> 04:22.530
HOW IS THAT THING
DANGEROUS?

04:22.563 --> 04:23.697
LET ME SHOW YOU.

04:23.731 --> 04:26.300
I'M COMING
TO THE EDGE OF THE STAIRS,

04:26.334 --> 04:27.801
I WISH I KNEW HOW TO STOP,

04:27.835 --> 04:31.339
BUT I'M JUST A BABY...

04:32.373 --> 04:33.907
OH, NO, BABY. IT'S SAFE.

04:33.941 --> 04:34.942
IT DIDN'T BREAK.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.310
OH. HEY, GIRLS.

04:36.344 --> 04:37.511
HEY. WE'RE
JUST PRACTICING

04:37.545 --> 04:38.779
THROWING THE BABY
DOWN THE STAIRS.

04:38.812 --> 04:40.914
OH, WELL, WE'RE
JUST TRYING TO REHEARSE.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.583
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
HAD DANCE SQUAD TODAY.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.018
I'M NOT IN DANCE SQUAD ANYMORE.
I'M A CHEERLEADER.

04:45.052 --> 04:45.853
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.

04:45.886 --> 04:48.422
YEAH, BABE. CHEERLEADERS
ARE COOL, OK?

04:48.456 --> 04:49.690
DANCE SQUAD'S
FOR LOSER SLUTS

04:49.723 --> 04:51.559
WHO CAN'T GET
BOYFRIENDS, RIGHT?

04:51.592 --> 04:53.093
SKANKS, NOT SLUTS.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.795
LET'S REHEARSE OUT BACK,
GIRLS.

04:54.828 --> 04:55.563
BUT WE'RE NOT
ALL HERE.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.798
WELL, IF SOMEONE
CAN'T BE ON TIME,

04:57.831 --> 04:59.600
THEY SHOULDN'T GET
TO REHEARSE WITH US.

04:59.633 --> 05:00.801
I'M HERE. I'M HERE.
I'M HERE.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.069
I WAS JUST STRETCHING.

05:02.102 --> 05:03.003
HEY, MOM. HEY, DAD.

05:03.036 --> 05:03.937
OH, MY GOD.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.073
JIM, IS THERE SOMETHIN'
YOU WANT TO TELL US?

05:06.106 --> 05:08.742
GO, ST. FINNIAN'S! WHOO!

05:08.776 --> 05:09.510
WHAT?

05:09.543 --> 05:11.111
YEAH, YEAH.
I'M A CHEERLEADER NOW.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.713
I FIGURED I HAD
ALL THIS SCHOOL SPIRIT

05:12.746 --> 05:14.948
AND NO WAY TO CHANNEL IT,
SO NOW I DO.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.850
WELL...

05:18.552 --> 05:20.854
ALL RIGHT, GIRLS,
TIME TO PRACTICE!

05:20.888 --> 05:21.789
GO, LIONS!

05:21.822 --> 05:23.557
HOORAY!
WHOO!

05:23.591 --> 05:24.525
UH, JIM?

05:24.558 --> 05:26.093
JIM

05:27.561 --> 05:29.029
WHAT THE HELL'S
GOIN' ON?

05:29.062 --> 05:31.665
OK, I'M FILLING IN
FOR BRIAN.

05:31.699 --> 05:32.600
WHO'S BRIAN?

05:32.633 --> 05:36.437
UNTIL RECENTLY,
THE LUCKIEST GUY IN SCHOOL.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.583
WHUH! OOH!

05:49.617 --> 05:50.784
UHH! EH!

05:54.722 --> 05:56.123
GET OUT OF HERE, PERV!

05:56.156 --> 05:57.491
Brian: AAH!

05:57.525 --> 06:00.428
OW! I THINK
I PULLED MY HAMSTRING.

06:00.461 --> 06:00.994
OH, NO!

06:01.028 --> 06:03.030
WHAT ARE WE
GONNA DO?

06:03.063 --> 06:04.798
Brian: OH!

06:05.032 --> 06:07.635
I HAVE BEEN GETTING
MORE ELBOW ACTION

06:07.668 --> 06:08.836
THAN I KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.739
I'M PROUD OF YOU, SON.

06:11.772 --> 06:14.875
ALL RIGHT!
GO, LIONS! WHOO!

06:16.143 --> 06:17.044
HEY, DID YOU SEE AMY?

06:17.077 --> 06:22.450
YEAH. YEAH.
OH, IT WAS A HOOT.

06:29.957 --> 06:31.425
EDDIE.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.794
AMY.

06:34.495 --> 06:35.629
HOW'S IT GOIN'?

06:35.663 --> 06:37.865
HOW DOES IT LOOK
LIKE IT'S GOING?

06:37.898 --> 06:41.602
I HAVE MY OWN GALLERY SHOW.
I'VE BEEN PUBLISHED.

06:41.635 --> 06:42.870
GOOD FOR YOU.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.506
YES, IT IS.
IT'S VERY GOOD.

06:46.907 --> 06:51.612
SO, UH, A LOT
OF THESE PICTURES
SEEM TO BE OF ME.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.180
THEY'RE ALL OF YOU.

06:53.213 --> 06:56.016
IT'S FROM
A COLLECTION CALLED
EDDIE UNLEASHED,

06:56.049 --> 06:58.786
EXCEPT FOR
THAT ONE PICTURE
CALLED EDDIE LEASHED.

06:58.819 --> 07:01.555
WELL, YOU GOT
TO CUT IT OUT.

07:01.589 --> 07:02.422
WHY?

07:02.456 --> 07:04.792
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
NAKED PICTURES OF ME

07:04.825 --> 07:07.060
HANGIN' IN A GALLERY.
THAT'S WHY.

07:07.094 --> 07:10.197
WELL, WE ALWAYS
WANTED DIFFERENT THINGS.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.065
BUT IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER,

07:12.099 --> 07:15.168
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
WHAT PEOPLE ARE WILLING
TO PAY FOR THESE.

07:15.202 --> 07:16.036
TRY ME.

07:16.069 --> 07:16.837
WELL, THAT ONE,

07:16.870 --> 07:19.707
WHICH I CALL
EDDIE IN REPOSE,

07:19.740 --> 07:20.641
20 GRAND.

07:20.674 --> 07:23.544
WELL, I DO LOOK PRETTY GOOD
IN THE HARNESS.

07:23.577 --> 07:25.813
SO WITH MY BOOK DEAL
AND THIS SHOW,

07:25.846 --> 07:27.948
I SHOULD CLEAR CLOSE
TO HALF A MILLION
THIS YEAR.

07:27.981 --> 07:31.519
I'M REALLY HAPPY FOR YOU,
BUT I CANNOT ALLOW THIS.

07:31.552 --> 07:33.153
REALLY? WELL,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

07:33.186 --> 07:34.187
I COULD SUE YOU.

07:34.221 --> 07:37.190
AND I COULD
MURDER YOU.

07:37.224 --> 07:38.692
HEHH...

07:38.726 --> 07:40.861
I'M JUST KIDDING.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.763
OR AM I?

07:45.699 --> 07:46.299
WOW.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.200
YEAH.
SHE BROKE THE KNIFE.

07:47.234 --> 07:50.538
NO. I MEAN, SHE'S
CLEARIN' HALF A MILLION?

07:50.571 --> 07:52.706
AND SHE'S NOT SPENDING
ANY OF IT ON THERAPY.

07:52.740 --> 07:53.541
ED, THINK
ABOUT THIS, MAN.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.609
WE SHOULD GET HER
TO BUY THE RED BOOT.

07:55.643 --> 07:57.010
WHY WOULD SHE WANT
TO BUY THE RED BOOT?

07:57.044 --> 07:59.980
WHAT KIND OF PERSON
WOULD WANT TO BUY
THE RED BOOT?

08:00.013 --> 08:01.014
RIGHT

08:01.048 --> 08:01.982
BLANK AMY.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.817
THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.

08:03.851 --> 08:05.919
WHY NOT? YOU COULD
GET HER TO DO IT.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.087
YOU CAN TALK HER
INTO ANYTHING.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.823
LOOK, SEAN, SEEIN' HER
BROUGHT BACK A LOT
OF BAD MEMORIES

08:09.857 --> 08:11.892
AND IT CREATED
A LOT OF WORSE ONES.

08:11.925 --> 08:12.993
WE'RE NOT EVEN
BREAKIN' EVEN ANYMORE.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.295
WE'RE LOSIN' MONEY.
YOU'RE LOSIN' MONEY.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.196
WHY WON'T YOU DO THIS?

08:16.229 --> 08:17.931
BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE
TO TALK TO HER AGAIN.

08:17.965 --> 08:21.068
SO? COME ON.
WE GOTTA STRIKE
WHILE THE IRON'S NUTS.

08:21.101 --> 08:22.102
I DON'T KNOW.

08:22.135 --> 08:25.005
LOOK, SHE'S EXPLOITING
YOU, MAN, HUH?

08:25.038 --> 08:26.273
YOU THINK SHE WAS
THINKING ABOUT YOU?

08:26.306 --> 08:27.708
SHE TOOK
NAKED PICTURES OF YOU,

08:27.741 --> 08:29.309
AND SHE'S SELLING 'EM
ON THE STREET!

08:29.342 --> 08:30.844
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST DO THE SAME TO HER?

08:30.878 --> 08:31.979
I DON'T EVEN
HAVE A CAMERA.

08:32.012 --> 08:35.048
AW, GOD, ED!
WHAT OPTIONS DO WE HAVE?

08:35.082 --> 08:37.250
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,
I'M GONNA GO TO THE STORE
NOW, ALL RIGHT?

08:37.284 --> 08:39.252
AND I'M GONNA GO TO THE DELI.
I'M GONNA GET A SANDWICH,

08:39.286 --> 08:40.287
AND RIGHT AFTER THAT,
I'M GONNA GO

08:40.320 --> 08:43.290
AND I'M GONNA EXPLOIT
MY CRAZY EX-GIRLFRIEND.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.258
THAT'S MY BOY, HUH?

08:45.292 --> 08:47.227
HEY, BABE.

08:47.260 --> 08:47.995
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:48.028 --> 08:49.196
I'M GOING THROUGH
THESE CATALOGUES

08:49.229 --> 08:51.765
AND MAKING A LIST
OF ALL THE NEW STUFF
I NEED FOR THE BABY.

08:51.799 --> 08:55.002
"$90 FOR A BABY CARRIER"?

08:55.035 --> 08:57.070
AREN'T YOU A BABY CARRIER?

08:57.605 --> 08:59.673
WE. AREN'T WE BABY CARRIERS?

08:59.707 --> 09:00.808
WE CAN'T AFFORD A NANNY,

09:00.841 --> 09:03.010
SO UNLESS YOU
WANT TO STUFF THE BABY
INTO A FANNY PACK,

09:03.043 --> 09:04.011
WE NEED A BABY CARRIER.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.947
THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF HERE
THAT WE DON'T NEED.

09:06.980 --> 09:07.881
I MEAN, UH...

09:07.915 --> 09:09.316
WHAT'S A WIPE WARMER?

09:09.349 --> 09:10.250
IT'S A THING
THAT WARMS UP THE WIPES

09:10.283 --> 09:11.551
SO THEY'RE NICE AND WARM
FOR THE BABY'S BUTT.

09:11.585 --> 09:14.922
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN DOIN'
THE OL' COLD-WIPE METHOD
FOR 35 YEARS,

09:14.955 --> 09:17.224
AND MY BOTTOM'S
JUST FINE, THANK YOU.
EW.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.860
I'M JUST SAYIN', BABE,
THIS STUFF COSTS
A LOT OF MONEY,

09:19.893 --> 09:22.029
AND WE'RE NOT EXACTLY
ROLLING IN DOUGH RIGHT NOW.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.597
WELL, LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

09:23.631 --> 09:25.065
THE BABY
CAN'T HAVE NOTHING.

09:25.098 --> 09:26.133
WELL, WE SHOULD DO
WHAT OTHER PEOPLE DO.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.434
WE'LL JUST HAVE YOUR FRIENDS
THROW YOU A BABY SHOWER.

09:27.467 --> 09:31.171
HONEY, NOBODY IS GONNA
THROW ME A BABY SHOWER
FOR OUR FOURTH KID.

09:31.204 --> 09:32.840
WELL, THEN I'LL
THROW YOU A BABY SHOWER.

09:32.873 --> 09:35.175
JUST FORGET IT, ALL RIGHT?
I'LL CALL MY DAD.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.677
NO! NO WAY. NO.

09:36.710 --> 09:39.046
I AM GONNA FIND A WAY
TO GET YOU ALL THIS STUFF:

09:39.079 --> 09:42.115
THE BABY CARRIER,
THE BREAST PUMP,
THE WIPE WARMER.

09:42.149 --> 09:44.151
I THOUGHT YOU
SAID WE DIDN'T
NEED A WIPE WARMER.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.687
YOU GOT ME
A LITTLE CURIOUS.

09:49.657 --> 09:50.958
GO, LIONS.
GO, LIONS.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.192
WHOO! WHOO!

09:52.225 --> 09:54.361
AHH.

09:54.394 --> 09:55.128
THANKS, JIMMY.

09:55.162 --> 09:57.965
JUST DOIN' MY PART
FOR THE SCHOOL.

09:57.998 --> 10:00.067
YOU CAN LET GO NOW.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.101
I LANDED.

10:01.134 --> 10:02.135
WELL, I'M THE SPOTTER,

10:02.169 --> 10:04.905
SO I'LL TELL YOU
WHEN YOU'RE SAFE.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.406
SHE'S SAFE!

10:06.439 --> 10:07.407
OK.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.143
GIRLS, YOU'RE FREE TO
MOVE AROUND THE BACKYARD.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.078
THANKS,
JIMMY.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.079
OK, I THINK
WE'RE DONE, GIRLS.

10:12.112 --> 10:16.016
WAIT. NO.
LET'S TRY THE PYRAMID
ONE MORE TIME.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.184
COME ON. SECOND ROW.

10:17.217 --> 10:20.153
JIMMY, WE'VE DONE
THE PYRAMID A DOZEN TIMES.
WE'RE DONE!

10:20.187 --> 10:22.089
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS.
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

10:22.122 --> 10:22.956
WAIT. HANG ON.
HANG ON.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.859
GIRLS, AREN'T YOU
FORGETTING SOMETHING?

10:27.294 --> 10:29.062
SQUAD HUG.

10:29.096 --> 10:31.031
SQUAD HUG!
SQUAD HUG!

10:35.068 --> 10:37.104
OK, TIME'S UP.
BYE, NOW.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.338
BYE.

10:38.371 --> 10:39.372
Girls: BYE.

10:39.406 --> 10:42.109
JIMMY, I WANT YOU
OFF THE SQUAD.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.476
WHY? 'CAUSE
I'VE GOT SPIRIT?

10:43.510 --> 10:47.881
NO. BECAUSE YOU'RE USING THIS
AS AN EXCUSE TO RUB UP
AGAINST PEOPLE.

10:47.915 --> 10:49.049
IT'S DISGUSTING.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.684
LILY, I THINK YOU'RE
A LITTLE OUT OF LINE
HERE, ALL RIGHT?

10:50.718 --> 10:52.119
I JUST LOVE
CHEERLEADING.

10:52.152 --> 10:55.188
YOU DON'T KNOW
THE FIRST THING
ABOUT CHEERLEADING.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.190
SURE, I DO. I KNOW
THE AZTEC PYRAMID,

10:57.224 --> 10:59.059
THE ZIGZAG SPLIT
CASCADE,

10:59.092 --> 11:01.762
AND I'M WORKING
ON MY SPIRIT FINGERS.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.096
OW. OW! OW! OW!

11:03.130 --> 11:05.833
OOH, OOH. OW. OW.

11:12.105 --> 11:15.843
THANK YOU. THAT WAS
MORE THAN UNNECESSARY.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.412
OH, EDDIE, YOU CAME BACK.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.148
WAS IT FOR ME...

11:21.181 --> 11:22.182
OR FOR YOUR CHEESE?

11:22.215 --> 11:27.154
NO. I JUST WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.355
OH, I DON'T KNOW, EDDIE.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.357
WE TALKED BEFORE,
YOU KNOW?

11:30.390 --> 11:32.793
HARSH THINGS WERE SAID.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.862
VIOLENT THINGS
WERE CONTEMPLATED.

11:34.895 --> 11:36.163
I KNOW. I JUST--

11:36.196 --> 11:38.398
YOU WANT ME BACK,
DON'T YOU?

11:38.431 --> 11:39.933
WELL, I--

11:39.967 --> 11:41.101
OH, I DON'T KNOW, ED.

11:41.134 --> 11:43.904
YOU HURT ME
REAL BAD LAST TIME.

11:43.937 --> 11:46.106
YOU HURT ME...

11:46.139 --> 11:47.240
REAL BAD.

11:47.274 --> 11:50.243
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

11:50.277 --> 11:53.781
EH, THAT'S OK.
JUST DON'T DO IT AGAIN.

11:54.882 --> 11:57.250
MM...MM...MM!

11:59.552 --> 12:01.054
HEY, I GOT YOUR MESSAGE.
WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT?

12:01.088 --> 12:02.155
WELL, I--

12:02.189 --> 12:03.223
SURPRISE!
SURPRISE!

12:03.256 --> 12:04.491
ARE THEY
TALKIN' TO ME?

12:04.524 --> 12:05.859
IT'S
YOUR BABY SHOWER.

12:05.893 --> 12:07.828
HONEY, I DON'T KNOW
ANY OF THOSE PEOPLE.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.096
THAT'S A BUNCH
OF RANDOM STRANGERS.

12:09.129 --> 12:12.432
OH, COME ON. COME ON.
THE DRY-CLEANER'S SON
A RANDOM STRANGER?

12:12.465 --> 12:13.867
YOU'VE KNOWN HIM
FOR 10 YEARS.

12:13.901 --> 12:16.136
HONEY, I DON'T KNOW
THESE PEOPLE.

12:16.169 --> 12:17.437
WHERE ARE MY FRIENDS?

12:17.470 --> 12:18.338
OK, DON'T BE SILLY.

12:18.371 --> 12:19.840
THESE PEOPLE ARE ALL
IMPORTANT TO YOU, OK?

12:19.873 --> 12:21.308
LOOK, GURMEET
FROM STATISTICS CLASS.

12:21.341 --> 12:25.412
HELLO, CYNTHIA.
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR INVITING ME.

12:25.445 --> 12:28.348
OH, WELL, WHEN SEAN
SAID, "BABY SHOWER,"

12:28.381 --> 12:30.517
I SAID, "GURMEET."

12:30.550 --> 12:33.086
AND OF COURSE
YOU REMEMBER STEVIE,
THE PAPERBOY?

12:33.120 --> 12:35.856
HEY, MRS. F,
YOU'RE LOOKIN' FINE.

12:35.889 --> 12:36.824
THANK YOU, STEVIE.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.491
I MEAN, REAL FINE.

12:38.525 --> 12:40.393
HEY,
WATCH IT, PAL.

12:40.894 --> 12:43.030
SEAN, THIS IS HUMILIATING.
I'M GOING HOME.

12:43.063 --> 12:43.964
NO, NO, BABY.
YOU CAN'T GO.

12:43.997 --> 12:46.533
THESE PEOPLE TOOK TIME
OUT OF THEIR BUSY DAY

12:46.566 --> 12:48.869
JUST TO COME HERE
AND CELEBRATE YOU.

12:48.902 --> 12:50.470
COME ON.
YOU CAN'T LEAVE NOW.

12:50.503 --> 12:52.205
IS THAT THE GUY
WHO LIVES IN THE ATM?

12:52.239 --> 12:55.508
NO. HE'S THE GUY
THAT HANGS OUT
IN THE ATM, OK?

12:55.542 --> 12:56.376
HE CAME IN FOR
A GLASS OF WATER,

12:56.409 --> 12:58.011
AND WHEN I TOLD HIM
IT WAS YOUR SHOWER,

12:58.045 --> 13:00.447
HE BEGGED ME
TO LET HIM STAY.

13:00.480 --> 13:01.348
GOOD-BYE.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.583
NO, NO, NO, BABY!
YOU CAN'T GO.
PLEASE.

13:03.616 --> 13:04.784
WHY?

13:04.818 --> 13:07.387
OK, BECAUSE EDDIE'S
BRINGING CRAZY AMY
OVER TO BUY THE BAR,

13:07.420 --> 13:08.555
AND I WANT HER TO
SEE THE PLACE FULL.

13:08.588 --> 13:12.359
YOU TRICKED ALL THOSE PEOPLE
INTO COMING TO MY BABY SHOWER

13:12.392 --> 13:14.561
SO YOU COULD UNLOAD
YOUR FAILING BAR
ON A CRAZY WOMAN?

13:14.594 --> 13:16.897
YEAH. I WOULD'VE TRICKED
YOUR FRIENDS, TOO,
IF THEY WERE AROUND.

13:16.930 --> 13:20.968
OK, WILL YOU PLEASE JUST
TO TALK TO MRS. KELLY,
THE BUTCHER'S WIFE.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.870
SHE DOESN'T
KNOW ANYBODY.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.905
NEITHER DO I.
GO!

13:24.938 --> 13:26.907
HI.

13:26.940 --> 13:27.607
HELLO.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.149

13:36.183 --> 13:37.517
IT'S CRA-AY--

13:37.550 --> 13:38.418
AMY.

13:38.451 --> 13:42.890
OH, IT'S OK, SEAN.
I'M NOT CRA-AY ANYMORE.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.525
SHE SWITCHED
MEDICATIONS.

13:45.558 --> 13:46.526
REALLY?

13:46.559 --> 13:49.062
YEAH. I FEEL LIKE
I'M WRAPPED IN WARM BLANKETS.

13:49.096 --> 13:51.932
WOW. WHO WOULDN'T
WANT THAT, HUH?

13:51.965 --> 13:52.599
EXACTLY.

13:52.632 --> 13:55.135
WOW, THIS PLACE
IS HOPPING.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.369
BUSIER THAN USUAL, HUH?

13:56.403 --> 13:59.873
YOU THINK? IT ACTUALLY
SEEMS KINDA SLOW
FOR A WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

13:59.907 --> 14:02.609
YOU DON'T SAY? HMM.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.878
HEY, THERE'S CLAUDIA.

14:09.149 --> 14:10.550
SURPRISINGLY WELL.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.519
DID YOU TALK TO HER
ABOUT BUYING THE BAR?

14:12.552 --> 14:14.354
ALMOST.

14:15.055 --> 14:16.123
SO...

14:16.156 --> 14:17.991
WHAT'D YOU WANT
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT?

14:18.025 --> 14:21.561
AH, FORGET ABOUT IT.
IT WAS NOTHIN'.

14:21.594 --> 14:23.931
YOU SLEPT
WITH CRAZY AMY?

14:23.964 --> 14:27.200
I DON'T APPRECIATE
YOU CALLIN' HER CRAZY.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.035
COME ON, ED!

14:28.068 --> 14:29.669
SHE FLIPPED YOUR CAR.
SHE STABBED YOU.

14:29.702 --> 14:33.440
SHE JUST MADE A FORTUNE
SELLING NUDE PHOTOGRAPHS
OF YOU.

14:33.473 --> 14:34.908
QUIXOTIC.
WHAT?

14:34.942 --> 14:36.643
THEY CALL IT
QUIXOTIC.

14:36.676 --> 14:39.012
IF YOU SELL
THAT NUTBAG OUR BAR,

14:39.046 --> 14:41.614
I'LL CALL HER
"YOUR MAJESTY."

14:43.350 --> 14:44.184
HEY.
HEY, DAD.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.353
I'M HERE FOR MOM'S SHOWER.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.687
SHE'S RIGHT OVER THERE
WITH HER FRIENDS.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.291
SHE'S SITTING NEXT TO THE GUY
FROM THE HARDWARE STORE

14:51.324 --> 14:52.459
WHO CUTS KEYS?

14:52.492 --> 14:54.962
NO, THAT JUST
LOOKS LIKE THE GUY
FROM THE HARDWARE STORE,

14:54.995 --> 14:55.963
BUT DON'T TELL
YOUR MOTHER.

14:55.996 --> 14:58.065
IT'LL RUIN
HER SPECIAL DAY.

14:59.466 --> 15:02.335
HEY, HEY! HOW WAS
CHEERLEADING PRACTICE?

15:02.369 --> 15:03.971

15:31.698 --> 15:33.000
I HAD THIS
DEEP-TISSUE MASSAGE,

15:33.033 --> 15:33.766
AND NOW
IT'S BACK TO NORMAL.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.602
WELL, IT'S GOOD
TO HAVE YOU BACK.

15:35.635 --> 15:38.138
SEE YA, JIMMY.
I DON'T THINK SO.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.673
BRIAN,
THIS IS MY TEAM NOW.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.442
I'VE BEEN GONE

15:42.475 --> 15:46.046
WELL, T-O-O B-A-D.

15:46.079 --> 15:47.014

YEAH? WELL, I MADE 'EM
MINE, PAL! SO BACK OFF!

15:49.049 --> 15:51.451
NO WAY! YOU'LL NEVER

15:51.484 --> 15:53.186
HEY.

15:53.220 --> 15:55.022
BOYS, CALM DOWN.

15:55.055 --> 15:59.092
I'M SURE WE CAN
FIND A SOLUTION THAT
WILL MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY.

16:07.534 --> 16:08.635
WHAT ARE YOU
COMPLAINING ABOUT?

16:08.668 --> 16:10.970
I MEAN,

16:12.805 --> 16:13.973
OK. NEXT QUESTION.

16:14.007 --> 16:18.045
"WHAT WERE YOU WEARING
ON THE NIGHT SEAN
GOT YOU PREGNANT?"

16:18.078 --> 16:18.878
EWW.

16:18.911 --> 16:21.014

BABY SHOWER FOREVER,

16:33.060 --> 16:34.127
BUT I'M--

16:34.161 --> 16:37.064
I'M REALLY TIRED.
SO, UM, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO GO HOME.

16:37.097 --> 16:39.166
WAIT. AREN'T YOU
GONNA OPEN
THE PRESENTS?

16:39.199 --> 16:41.168
LILY, HONEY,
THESE PEOPLE
DON'T KNOW ME.

16:41.201 --> 16:43.770
I'M SURE NOBODY
BROUGHT ANY PRESENTS.

16:43.803 --> 16:44.737
Gurmeet: TA-DA!

16:44.771 --> 16:48.141
HOLY COW. WOULD YOU LOOK
AT ALL THOSE PRESENTS.

16:48.175 --> 16:49.209
OPEN THIS ONE FIRST, HUH?

16:49.242 --> 16:54.047
WELL, YOU--
YOU REALLY DIDN'T
HAVE TO DO ALL THIS.

16:54.081 --> 16:56.116
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
IT WASN'T--

16:56.149 --> 16:59.286
OH, MY GOSH!
IT'S A WIPE WARMER!

16:59.319 --> 17:01.521
GURMEET,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.156
THEY'RE NOT JUST
FOR BABIES, YOU KNOW.

17:03.190 --> 17:06.759
A WIPE WARMER FROM--
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

17:06.793 --> 17:08.295
GURMEET BHODHIVANAM.

17:08.328 --> 17:10.230
I'LL JUST WRITE
"GARY."

17:10.263 --> 17:13.700
OK, UM, THIS ONE
DOESN'T HAVE A TAG,

17:13.733 --> 17:18.105
BUT IT'S...
A NURSING BRA.

17:18.138 --> 17:19.106
THANK YOU, STEVIE.

17:19.139 --> 17:22.142
NO PROBLEM. TRY IT ON.

17:22.609 --> 17:23.176
MAYBE LATER.

17:23.210 --> 17:26.646
OK. THIS ONE'S
FROM MARK.

17:26.679 --> 17:28.448
IT'S...

17:28.481 --> 17:30.083
A BABY MONITOR!

17:30.117 --> 17:33.120
OH, MY GOSH!
THANK YOU, MARK!

17:33.153 --> 17:33.886
I'M MARK.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.489
I KNOW. I'M GONNA
GET TO EVERYONE.

17:36.523 --> 17:39.126
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO WITH
ALL YOUR NEW MONEY?

17:39.159 --> 17:41.761
REMEMBER THAT 950-PAGE
SCREENPLAY I WROTE

17:41.794 --> 17:43.763
ABOUT CANNIBALS
DURING THE PLAGUE?

17:43.796 --> 17:46.399
YEAH. THAT WAS FUNNY.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.101
OH. THANK YOU.

17:48.135 --> 17:52.505
WELL, I FIGURED THAT
IF I CUT IT DOWN TO...

17:52.539 --> 17:55.342
750 PAGES, I CAN FILM IT.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.578
HEY. YOU TWO MIND
IF I SIT DOWN?

17:58.611 --> 18:00.847
I'M TIRED. I'VE BEEN
POURING SO MANY DRINKS.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.883
EDDIE AND I WERE
JUST TALKING ABOUT WHAT
I'M GONNA DO WITH ALL MY MONEY.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.219
YEAH. GOD, IF I
HAD MONEY LIKE THAT,

18:06.253 --> 18:08.188
I'D PROBABLY
BUY THIS BAR.

18:08.221 --> 18:08.988
IS IT FOR SALE?

18:09.021 --> 18:10.390
WOW. I HADN'T
EVEN THOUGHT OF THAT.

18:10.423 --> 18:13.526
WHAT DO YOU THINK, ED?
IS THIS BAR FOR SALE?

18:13.560 --> 18:14.461
NO.

18:14.494 --> 18:16.729
NO. IT'D BE TOO HARD
TO SAY--TO SAY GOOD-BYE,

18:16.763 --> 18:18.865
BUT I GUESS IF
ANY OFFER CAME ALONG,

18:18.898 --> 18:21.301
WE'D HAVE
TO CONSIDER IT.

18:21.334 --> 18:22.169
I'VE ALWAYS
LOVED THIS PLACE,

18:22.202 --> 18:23.536
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'D DO WITH A BAR.

18:23.570 --> 18:26.473
WELL, YOU COULD MAKE
A GALLERY OUT OF IT,

18:26.506 --> 18:27.440
OR A BOOKSTORE.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.276
I MEAN,
JUST GO CRAZY.

18:30.543 --> 18:31.744
WELL...

18:31.778 --> 18:33.880
THAT'S
A BIG DECISION.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.515
WHAT DO YOU THINK, ED?

18:35.548 --> 18:36.816
YEAH, ED.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

18:36.849 --> 18:39.786
I DON'T KNOW. A LOT
OF MY BLOOD AND SWEAT
WENT INTO THIS PLACE.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.254
I'M IN.

18:41.288 --> 18:42.522
OH, MY GOD.

18:42.555 --> 18:43.556
THANK YOU, AMY.
THANK YOU.

18:43.590 --> 18:46.459
NO TOUCHING.
OK. OK. OK.

18:46.759 --> 18:47.894
MRS. WEXLER,
PLEASE TELL MORRIS

18:47.927 --> 18:49.162
I HOPE HIS BACK
FEELS BETTER.

18:49.196 --> 18:52.399
AND, SANDRA, I'M GONNA
E-MAIL YOU THAT RECIPE.
I WON'T FORGET.

18:52.432 --> 18:53.900
GURMEET, YOU AND LAKSHMI,

18:53.933 --> 18:55.868
OUR HOUSE, GAME NIGHT,
NEXT FRIDAY. DON'T FORGET.

18:55.902 --> 18:58.771
HA HA. YOU TRY
AND STOP ME, HUH?

18:58.805 --> 19:01.174
BYE-BYE. SEE YA.

19:01.208 --> 19:03.510
BABY, I'M SO SORRY ABOUT
THIS BABY SHOWER MESS.

19:03.543 --> 19:05.245
I PROMISE
I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

19:05.278 --> 19:06.045
ARE YOU KIDDING?

19:06.078 --> 19:08.281
THAT WAS THE BEST
BABY SHOWER EVER.

19:08.315 --> 19:09.182
SERIOUSLY?
YES.

19:09.216 --> 19:10.917
IT'S WEIRD. I SEE
THESE PEOPLE EVERY DAY,

19:10.950 --> 19:12.952
BUT I NEVER REALLY GOT
TO MEET THEM, YOU KNOW?

19:12.985 --> 19:16.256
THEY ARE REALLY SWEET
AND REA GENEROUS.

19:16.289 --> 19:18.291
I'LL SAY. I MEAN,
LOOK, BABY MONITORS,

19:18.325 --> 19:19.892
A LAMBSKIN BLANKET,
AND--

19:19.926 --> 19:21.261
HEY, WHO GOT
THE CAR SEAT?

19:21.294 --> 19:22.695
STAN.
STAN?

19:22.729 --> 19:23.730
YEAH. THE GUY
WHO LIVES AT THE ATM.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.932
HE LEFT FOR, LIKE, 15 MINUTES
AND BROUGHT IT BACK.

19:25.965 --> 19:31.238
OH, GOOD. BECAUSE
IT STILL HAS A PIECE
OF SEAT BELT IN IT.

19:31.271 --> 19:32.839
UH...

19:32.872 --> 19:34.241
WIPE WARMER.

19:34.274 --> 19:35.074
HEY, PUT THAT DOWN.

19:35.107 --> 19:38.711
IT HAS TO BE TESTED
FOR SAFETY FIRST.

19:38.745 --> 19:41.180
YOU ARE SICK.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.950
OK. THERE WE GO.

19:43.983 --> 19:46.219
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M
GONNA BE A SALOON KEEPER.

19:46.253 --> 19:49.622
YEAH. SO I GUESS
ALL I NEED IS A CHECK
FOR THE DOWN PAYMENT.

19:49.656 --> 19:50.857
OH, I DON'T CARRY CHECKS.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.325
YOU KNOW, TOO DANGEROUS.

19:52.359 --> 19:53.660
IDENTITY THEFT.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.895
LOT OF CRAZIES OUT THERE.

19:55.928 --> 19:57.330
I'LL JUST GIVE YOU CASH.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.932
YEAH, BUT I NEED,
LIKE, 60,000.

19:59.966 --> 20:02.869
THAT'S 40 LARGE.
REST IS IN MY TRUNK.

20:02.902 --> 20:05.372
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
YOU SHOWED UP.

20:05.405 --> 20:08.808
YOU KNOW, AMY, I CAN'T
LET YOU BUY THE BAR.

20:08.841 --> 20:09.576
WHY?

20:09.609 --> 20:12.679
BECAUSE IT'S
A TERRIBLE INVESTMENT.

20:12.712 --> 20:13.413
BUT YOU SAID--

20:13.446 --> 20:14.481
THERE'S A PLACE
DOWN THE STREET

20:14.514 --> 20:18.818
THAT'S A GIANT
BOWLING ALLEY/
DRINKING HOLE/FUNNERY

20:18.851 --> 20:19.686
CALLED TJ SHENANIGAN'S.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.988
I KNOW. THEIR POTATO SKINS
ARE GIGANTIC.

20:22.021 --> 20:24.257
THEY'RE LIKE
CHILI-FILLED CANOES.

20:24.291 --> 20:25.592
SO YOU'VE BEEN THERE?

20:25.625 --> 20:27.527
YEAH. CHECK OUT
THE COMPETITION.

20:27.560 --> 20:28.261
THERE IS NO COMPETITION.

20:28.295 --> 20:29.296
WITH THAT PLACE
DOWN THE STREET,

20:29.329 --> 20:30.330
YOU'RE NEVER
GONNA MAKE ANY MONEY
AT THE RED BOOT.

20:30.363 --> 20:36.369
OH, LET'S JUST SAY THERE'S
A METHOD TO MY MADNESS.

20:39.506 --> 20:41.441
OK. WOULD THAT METHOD
BE ARSON?

20:41.474 --> 20:43.676
JUST CALL IT
A HAPPY ACCIDENT.

20:43.710 --> 20:44.844
COME ON.

20:44.877 --> 20:48.815
LIGHT'S GONNA GET
REALLY INTERESTING
IN ABOUT 2 MINUTES.

20:49.682 --> 20:53.420
ALL RIGHT, BUT I'M NOT
TAKING OFF MY CLOTHES.
