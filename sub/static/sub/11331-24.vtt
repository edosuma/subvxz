You would not believe what I've
been doing to try to get out of this!

00:05.382 --> 00:07.416
I have been picking out
(WHISPERS) china patterns.

00:07.417 --> 00:09.752
So, when are you getting married?
Deeper I get myself into this

00:09.753 --> 00:12.421
the more I feel absolutely certain
that I don't want to get married.

00:12.422 --> 00:13.489
I know what you mean.

00:13.490 --> 00:15.124
You're not in love with him.

00:15.125 --> 00:17.026
And I know you don't want to get married.

00:17.027 --> 00:18.427
Why would you want to destroy
the lives of three people?

00:18.428 --> 00:21.063
No matter how much those
three love each other,

00:21.064 --> 00:22.364
Amy does not want to marry Ricky.

00:22.365 --> 00:24.600
You never asked Amy about what Adrian said?

00:24.601 --> 00:26.841
Amy can tell me if she
doesn't want to get married.

00:28.925 --> 00:29.960
Goodbye, Adrian.

00:31.661 --> 00:34.529
Can you do anything to get
out of it? I joined months ago.

00:34.530 --> 00:36.566
My mom asked me to drop
this gift off to you.

00:37.400 --> 00:38.434

00:40.470 --> 00:42.437
I just don't want to get married right now.

00:42.438 --> 00:43.905
Well, then don't. Take your time.

00:43.906 --> 00:46.474
When I have sex with Amy, I
don't really feel anything.

00:46.475 --> 00:48.843
I've got nothing to give
back except her freedom.

00:48.844 --> 00:51.581
Very few people are gutsy
enough to call off a wedding.

00:51.582 --> 00:53.482
The day after graduation

00:53.483 --> 00:55.984
she just disappears and
goes to New York. Easy.

01:49.104 --> 01:51.674
- Yeah, but I love you.
- I don't have to go, do I?

01:51.675 --> 01:54.143
- Yes.
- Um... 

01:54.144 --> 01:55.712
Can I talk to the two of you alone?

04:16.119 --> 04:18.187
For a while.

04:18.188 --> 04:22.124
Then as things got worse, we
kind of moved into the kitchen,

like this room was too classy
for the arguments, you know?

front of the wedding china or something.

You're only young once. You
should be having a little fun.

- Why are you two taking a test?
- They're for you.

05:01.065 --> 05:04.967
I think the only way to be absolutely
sure is if you go see a doctor.

05:04.968 --> 05:08.004
I don't have that kind of doctor.
All I have is a pediatrician.

- Nothing.

06:02.592 --> 06:04.093
I know what you were looking at.

06:04.094 --> 06:07.562
Well, it's not exactly as if you're
trying to hide anything lately.

06:07.563 --> 06:10.531
- Excuse me?
- Before anybody gets really upset here,

06:10.532 --> 06:11.934
let's just talk about this.

06:11.935 --> 06:14.002
About this?

I'm sorry that you're a slut.

06:33.095 --> 06:35.396
A slut and a slut.

06:35.397 --> 06:38.465
Being a slut is gonna keep Ricky
interested in me and not you.

You know, in the long run,
while Ricky may love his son,

06:41.271 --> 06:45.006
he's probably never going to love
you because you ruined his life.

been back and forth so much

07:02.892 --> 07:05.093
how do we make this work?

07:05.094 --> 07:07.327
How do you even start
to forgive me for Adrian?

07:07.328 --> 07:09.899
Why not just forget everything
but how much we loved each other.

07:10.633 --> 07:11.901
How much we still do.

07:16.472 --> 07:20.141
I swear to you, Amy Juergens, I will
never do anything again to hurt you.

- Wait, wait!

have at a relationship,

07:43.031 --> 07:45.234

in and come to the rescue?

- So, how was your flight?
- It was good.

08:01.184 --> 08:03.251
I'll show you New York.

08:03.252 --> 08:06.222
I'm not really here to see New
York. I'm just here to see you.

08:10.092 --> 08:11.560
It's really good to see you, Amy.

08:12.962 --> 08:14.363
You too, Ricky. You, too.

08:18.100 --> 08:20.367
- Don't help me or anything.
- I'll help you.

08:20.368 --> 08:21.468
I'll give you some advice.

08:21.469 --> 08:23.337
Don't move into Ricky's apartment.

08:23.338 --> 08:25.474
It's too soon and you're not ready.

08:25.475 --> 08:27.342
No, you're not ready.

08:27.343 --> 08:30.077
But, you'll never be ready so
just try not to hate me for moving.

08:30.078 --> 08:32.412
Fine, don't listen to me.
But, you're gonna be sorry.

08:32.413 --> 08:34.081
No, I'm not gonna be sorry.

08:34.082 --> 08:35.284
Fine, then just move out.

08:36.418 --> 08:37.518
I am, tonight!

Hi.

Hi.

08:59.308 --> 09:00.576
I'm happy to have you home.

09:00.577 --> 09:02.076
I'm happy to be home.

09:16.091 --> 09:17.191
So?

09:19.061 --> 09:20.128
We... (SIGHS)

09:23.299 --> 09:24.565
got married.

09:38.855 --> 09:39.493
What's all this?

09:39.501 --> 09:41.752
Oh, well, since you were
coming home for dinner,

09:41.753 --> 09:43.197
I wanted to make it special.

09:43.620 --> 09:46.253
Now, since you're a restaurant
owner, it's hard to compete.

09:46.595 --> 09:47.312
Mmm.

09:47.479 --> 09:49.246
No competition.

09:49.247 --> 09:52.384
Eating with family beats eating
alone in the restaurant any day.

09:52.385 --> 09:54.085
Yes, it does.

09:54.086 --> 09:58.627
Why are we eating in here? We
haven't eaten in here since Dad died.

10:00.879 --> 10:02.345
What's going on? Why are we eating in here?

10:02.346 --> 10:05.184
I just want to have a
family dinner, all right?

10:05.185 --> 10:09.720
- Why?
- Because we're a family now,

10:09.721 --> 10:11.223
and our family's going to get larger.

10:11.224 --> 10:13.424
- Are you pregnant?
- No! (SCOFFS)

10:13.425 --> 10:17.161
I'm talking about Jack. Jack
will be part of our family.

10:17.162 --> 10:18.562
We're adding another family member.

10:21.133 --> 10:23.334
- Who's valedictorian?
- Not Grace.

10:25.270 --> 10:27.271
No, it's not me. It's Grant.

10:28.140 --> 10:30.374
Oh, that's nice.

10:30.375 --> 10:31.276
Yeah. Whatever.

10:34.012 --> 10:37.014
So, what's the decision on college?

10:37.015 --> 10:38.883
Well, I've been thinking

10:38.884 --> 10:42.052
and considering my relationship
with Jack and all the other guys... 

10:42.053 --> 10:44.456
You're not making another
decision based on guys, are you?

10:44.457 --> 10:46.991
No. What I was thinking is... 

10:48.861 --> 10:51.022
I don't know. Why did you
ever let me go out with Jack?

10:53.298 --> 10:55.367
Uh, I think we tried to stop you.

11:00.739 --> 11:04.242
What's that ring? I never
noticed you had a ring like that.

11:04.243 --> 11:05.136
It's a promise ring.

11:05.137 --> 11:06.977
My parents gave it to
me when I promised them

11:06.978 --> 11:08.780
I wouldn't have sex until I get married.

11:11.316 --> 11:14.752
I know what a promise ring is.
I just didn't know you had one.

11:14.753 --> 11:18.289
Last night. My parents and I
had a long talk about you and me.

11:18.290 --> 11:20.759
I thought your parents
were happy we were dating.

11:20.760 --> 11:23.861
I thought they trusted me. I'm a Christian.

11:23.862 --> 11:25.703
I'm just as committed
to abstinence as you are.

11:35.007 --> 11:38.243
- I had no idea it would be like that.
- Yeah, I didn't either.

11:38.244 --> 11:42.246
- I didn't expect you to be quite so aggressive.
- Yeah.

11:42.247 --> 11:44.383
GRACE: If I hadn't
gotten into that argument,

11:44.384 --> 11:46.590
and if I hadn't been so
determined to prove him wrong,

11:46.591 --> 11:47.591
 then I wouldn't have had sex.

11:48.720 --> 11:52.290
- If I hadn't had sex, then he would still be alive.
- Listen to me!

11:52.291 --> 11:54.758
One has nothing to do with the other.

11:54.759 --> 11:56.428
You didn't kill him, Grace.

11:56.429 --> 11:59.330
God is not punishing you for having sex.

11:59.331 --> 12:01.300
You are punishing you, so stop.

12:02.200 --> 12:05.236
- Med camp?
- Yeah.

12:05.237 --> 12:06.469
- How'd you know?
- How'd you know?

12:06.470 --> 12:08.772
I went there. I want to be a doctor.

12:08.773 --> 12:10.175
I went there. I want to be a doctor.

12:10.176 --> 12:11.208
BOTH: No way!

12:13.245 --> 12:14.278
So... 

12:15.314 --> 12:17.114
Okay, I... 

12:17.115 --> 12:19.318
- I do have one regret.
- And what's that?

12:19.319 --> 12:23.254
I regret that we wasted the
whole summer not having sex!

12:23.255 --> 12:25.056
- Oh, good.
- (CHUCKLING)

12:25.057 --> 12:27.692
- So you liked it.
- I liked it.

12:27.693 --> 12:29.192
Oh, we decided we'd go out.

12:29.193 --> 12:30.894
As long as we're still broken up.

12:30.895 --> 12:34.199
- We're still broken up, right?
- Yeah, we're still broken up.

12:35.267 --> 12:36.268
Good night, Grace.

12:40.072 --> 12:42.139
- Oh... am I interrupting?
- No.

12:46.244 --> 12:48.814
Do you think there's anything
to that kissing thing?

12:50.349 --> 12:51.783
Like how Adrian kissed Ricky?

13:02.728 --> 13:05.464
Jack, it would be so nice if you
woke up in time for Christmas.

13:07.232 --> 13:09.232
That would be the best
gift I could ask for,

13:09.233 --> 13:10.268
for you to wake up.

13:11.770 --> 13:14.272
You sure you don't want to wake up? For me?

13:28.320 --> 13:32.289
Hey, where were you this morning,
you missed graduation rehearsals.

13:32.290 --> 13:34.225
- Root canal.
- What?

13:34.226 --> 13:36.093
- Root canal.
- Root canal?

13:36.094 --> 13:38.129
You? You have perfect teeth!

13:38.130 --> 13:40.365
- Apparently not.
- (LAUGHS) Were you in pain?

13:40.366 --> 13:41.375
Am I in pain?

13:41.376 --> 13:44.769
Well, I've pretty much been in
pain for the last four years,

13:44.770 --> 13:47.706
so, why would today be
any different? (CHUCKLES)

13:49.274 --> 13:53.244
High school was not kind to you either.

13:53.245 --> 13:56.114
Well, here's hoping that
college will be better.

13:58.250 --> 14:02.053
So, do you think that college
will be better, for me, I mean?

14:02.054 --> 14:04.154
- I hope so, Ben.
- Are you going to marry Ricky,

14:04.155 --> 14:06.089
because living over you and Ricky

14:06.090 --> 14:09.192
could bring me to a new
depth of unhappiness which

14:09.193 --> 14:11.895
could have been my dad's plan all
along to keep me at home. (CHUCKLES)

14:11.896 --> 14:13.131
The wedding is tomorrow.

14:13.132 --> 14:14.799
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

14:17.803 --> 14:19.349
So you missed graduation rehearsals,

14:19.350 --> 14:20.922
I should tell you what we have to do.

14:21.206 --> 14:23.773
Be in the gym at 6:00.
Bring your cap and gown,

14:23.774 --> 14:25.742
what you have on underneath is up to you,

14:25.743 --> 14:27.846
and then, afterwards,
return your cap and gown

14:27.847 --> 14:29.780
to the locker,

14:29.781 --> 14:32.084
and make sure that there's
not anything left in our locker

14:32.085 --> 14:35.853
- but your cap and gown.
- I guess Ricky will be with you.

14:35.854 --> 14:37.421
Yeah, I guess he will.

14:37.422 --> 14:40.425
- I think I'm going to bring Adrian.
- Yeah. Makes sense.

14:40.426 --> 14:44.195
I mean, you and Adrian are friends
and I'm sure Adrian would like to come.

14:44.196 --> 14:45.396
You're really getting married?

14:51.136 --> 14:53.138
- So, you dance?
- Mmm-mmm. Not really.

14:53.139 --> 14:54.839
- (LAUGHING)
- Neither do I.

14:56.108 --> 14:57.142
How hard can it be?

15:11.356 --> 15:13.991
I've never had a boyfriend, ever.

15:13.992 --> 15:15.727
I've never had a girlfriend, ever.

15:26.071 --> 15:27.038
I forgot something.

15:28.373 --> 15:29.708
I forgot to do this.

15:43.021 --> 15:44.155
Good night, Amy.

15:46.391 --> 15:47.424
I love you.

15:50.962 --> 15:51.996
Me, too.

15:53.365 --> 15:54.399
Is she pregnant?

15:56.301 --> 15:59.204
- Pregnant?
- Yeah, you know, is she gonna have a baby?

15:59.205 --> 16:03.040
No! She can't be pregnant.
I just kissed her.

16:09.281 --> 16:13.918
(LAUGHING) Oh, wow! Oh,
man. Where are yours?

16:13.919 --> 16:16.253
- Somebody's in a good mood.
- I am.

16:16.254 --> 16:19.090
Ben, I am. (GIGGLING) I don't
know why I am. I just am.

16:20.825 --> 16:22.961
- Gonna be a family now.
- (LAUGHING) Yes.

16:24.095 --> 16:25.096
We are. (CHUCKLES)

16:27.032 --> 16:28.165
We are, Amy.

16:29.434 --> 16:31.101
Till death do us part.

16:38.009 --> 16:39.843
(BABY CRYING)

17:32.083 --> 17:33.083
Bye!

18:08.286 --> 18:09.753
So,

18:09.754 --> 18:11.321
I guess this is it.

18:11.322 --> 18:13.290
Yeah, guess this is it.

18:14.859 --> 18:17.261
- Don't make me cry.
- (LAUGHING) I'll be over here.

18:21.199 --> 18:23.333
I wish you were going with us.

18:23.334 --> 18:25.937
Well, maybe you can transfer
if you don't like Hudson.

18:26.471 --> 18:27.738
Yeah. Maybe.

18:29.874 --> 18:32.341
- So, what about the wedding? Is the wedding on?
- Yeah.

18:32.342 --> 18:33.444
The wedding is still on.

18:34.345 --> 18:35.811
It's going to be fine.

18:35.812 --> 18:37.949
You and Ricky will be very happy together.

18:38.750 --> 18:40.751
You don't believe that.

18:40.752 --> 18:44.888
No, you know what, I do. I think
that once you finally do it,

18:44.889 --> 18:47.791
you'll be so relieved that it's done.

18:47.792 --> 18:50.994
And then you'll settle
in and you'll be married

18:50.995 --> 18:53.096
- and stuff. (CHUCKLES)
- Yeah.

18:53.097 --> 18:56.100
Listen to Lauren, she's
right. I mean you're gonna be

18:56.101 --> 18:58.935
married and settled in

18:58.936 --> 19:02.406
and we're still gonna be best friends.
We're still gonna see each other.

19:02.407 --> 19:05.443
You know, you can come up to
Berkeley and have fun with us

19:05.444 --> 19:08.412
and we can come up to New York and see you.

19:09.313 --> 19:10.480
Sure. (CHUCKLES)

19:12.083 --> 19:15.152
Well, we're going to that party.

19:15.153 --> 19:17.253
Yeah. Are you sure you don't want to come?

19:17.254 --> 19:19.855
I'm getting married tomorrow. (LAUGHING)

19:19.856 --> 19:22.825
And we have to go pick
up John from Ricky's mom

19:22.826 --> 19:24.466
and I don't really want to go to a party.

19:25.863 --> 19:26.997
All right, then.

19:28.132 --> 19:29.434
I guess we'll be going.

19:31.302 --> 19:32.437
- Bye, Amy.
- Bye, Amy.

19:33.438 --> 19:34.471
Bye!

19:40.411 --> 19:41.813
Best friends forever!

19:53.858 --> 19:55.225
If you get bored... 

20:01.232 --> 20:04.135
Well, Henry, sir, I guess
high school is officially over

20:04.136 --> 20:08.004
- and you're officially one boot away from boot camp.
- Yeah.

20:08.005 --> 20:10.308
- I'm looking forward to that.
- You cried all night.

20:10.309 --> 20:12.375
- Whoa! All night?
- Yeah.

20:12.376 --> 20:15.244
- All night.
- What, are you gonna kiss and tell?

20:15.245 --> 20:16.280
We kind of got back together.

20:16.281 --> 20:19.749
- Oh, Good timing.
- HENRY: Hey, what can I say?

20:19.750 --> 20:22.184
- She's the love of my life.
- Oh, Henry.

20:22.185 --> 20:23.855
I wish you weren't going away.

20:23.856 --> 20:27.190
We're both going away, but when
we get back, it'll be for always.

20:27.191 --> 20:28.258
Oh, brother.

20:33.831 --> 20:36.132
- I saw that.
- (SIGHS)

20:36.133 --> 20:37.735
Yeah, I was looking at her, so what?

20:37.736 --> 20:41.771
- So, you're still in love with her, you big idiot.
- Yeah.

20:41.772 --> 20:43.739
All right. So, are we all
hanging out at your dad's house,

20:43.740 --> 20:46.340
or do the three of you want to
grow up and come over to the condo?

20:49.013 --> 20:50.080
Oh... 

20:51.182 --> 20:55.952
No. I'm not going over to your dad's house?

20:55.953 --> 20:57.987
You can come over, if you want.

20:57.988 --> 21:00.489
Yeah. Thanks for the invite but I
don't want to spoil your good time.

21:00.490 --> 21:03.761
We're just going to sit around and
eat junk food and cry. (CHUCKLES)

21:03.762 --> 21:06.296
Yeah, I'd rather do that alone.

21:06.297 --> 21:10.297
So, congratulations, Ben, Henry and
Alice, and, uh, yeah, I should be going.

21:13.504 --> 21:14.804
Bye.

21:16.774 --> 21:17.841
(LAUGHS)

21:20.311 --> 21:23.147
- We can go to the party if you want.
- No, I don't want.

21:23.148 --> 21:26.883
- I'm just saying.
- No. I just want to go home, I think.

21:26.884 --> 21:29.754
It's your graduation. We went
to a party after my graduation.

21:29.755 --> 21:33.189
No, we didn't go together,
we just ended up together.

21:33.190 --> 21:34.759
Yeah. We did, didn't we?

21:36.193 --> 21:37.993
I just really want to go home.

21:37.994 --> 21:40.164
Are you going to speak
to Adrian before she goes?

21:43.401 --> 21:44.467
Bye, Grace!

21:47.505 --> 21:49.072
Stay in touch, okay?

21:59.317 --> 22:01.918
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too.

22:03.287 --> 22:04.387
(SIGHS)

22:10.895 --> 22:13.163
(LAUGHING) Oh! All right.

22:25.509 --> 22:27.444
Thanks. (SNIFFLES)

22:27.445 --> 22:28.946
I'm really going to miss you two.

22:29.780 --> 22:31.015
(SNIFFLING) Bye, Jack!

22:33.117 --> 22:34.184
Bye, Ricky!

22:35.519 --> 22:36.519
Bye, Ben!

22:41.158 --> 22:42.526
I hope you'll be very happy.

22:44.996 --> 22:46.130
(LAUGHING) Okay, bye.

22:56.107 --> 22:57.973
(SOBBING) I don't want to go!

22:57.974 --> 23:00.177
I loved high school! I loved it here!

23:04.448 --> 23:06.117
Come on, Grace. Let's go.

23:20.364 --> 23:22.732
- May the best man win.
- (CHUCKLES)

23:22.733 --> 23:24.335
- Uh, the best man did win.
- (SIGHING)

23:25.036 --> 23:26.970
The wedding's tomorrow.

23:26.971 --> 23:29.273
It's not over until the
I do's have been said.

23:29.274 --> 23:31.107
Goodnight, Ben.

23:31.108 --> 23:33.077
Congratulations on your graduation.

23:35.946 --> 23:37.180
- Yeah.
- Goodnight.

23:41.052 --> 23:42.085
Goodnight.

23:52.063 --> 23:54.465
- Are you ready to leave?
- (DOOR OPENS)

23:54.466 --> 23:57.333
I just wish I could do it all over again,

23:57.334 --> 24:00.204
- do it differently, do it better,
- (DOOR CLOSES)

24:00.205 --> 24:03.907
(SIGHING) but I can't,
so, I guess it's time.

24:04.475 --> 24:05.942
I guess it is.

24:47.415 --> 24:49.848
All of this started when I
put this ring on my finger.

24:49.849 --> 24:50.851
So, you know what?

24:51.919 --> 24:53.287
I'm gonna take it off.

24:53.288 --> 24:55.889
JACK: All right!

24:55.890 --> 24:58.223
No, I'm taking it off
because I don't need it.

24:58.224 --> 25:00.826
I'm not tempted to have
sex with you anymore.

25:00.827 --> 25:02.327
I'm not tempted to have sex with anyone.

25:02.328 --> 25:04.129
I see you're not wearing
your promise ring anymore.

25:04.130 --> 25:05.264
No, you saw me take it off.

25:05.265 --> 25:07.132
Yeah, and I thought you
took it off in anger.

25:07.133 --> 25:09.168
Plus, I thought your parents would
make you put it right back on.

25:09.169 --> 25:10.903
No, they haven't even noticed it was off.

25:10.904 --> 25:12.938
Well, you should put it back
on. It's not safe out here.

25:12.939 --> 25:15.309
No. I don't care if it's not safe out here,

25:15.310 --> 25:17.243
it's safe in here.

25:17.244 --> 25:19.779
Grace, I love you.

25:19.780 --> 25:21.381
I've always loved you.

25:21.382 --> 25:23.315
But I don't know if that's enough.

25:23.316 --> 25:25.396
It may not be enough, but
it's a good place to start.

25:27.088 --> 25:28.456
I love you too, Jack.

25:36.430 --> 25:38.363
I still feel the same as
I did before about sex.

25:38.364 --> 25:39.965
I'm not ready to have sex.

25:39.966 --> 25:40.968
You sure about this?

25:41.702 --> 25:42.702
I'm sure.

25:43.771 --> 25:44.905
I'm absolutely sure.

25:49.310 --> 25:53.012
I want to have sex and we're
too young to get married.

25:53.013 --> 25:54.315
What are we supposed to do, Jack?

25:54.316 --> 25:57.217
- What are we supposed to do?
- I don't know.

25:57.218 --> 25:58.785
But here's an idea.

26:00.440 --> 26:02.608
Oral sex.

26:02.609 --> 26:05.512
It's... it's just an idea.
It's kind of a loophole.

26:05.143 --> 26:06.542
It's still sex.

26:06.543 --> 26:08.643
Not if you don't believe it's still sex.

26:08.644 --> 26:11.448
If you don't believe that, everybody wins!

26:15.786 --> 26:17.421
I hate that you've had sex with her.

26:17.422 --> 26:18.688
Well, I did.

26:18.689 --> 26:21.058
And I can't take it back, it happened.

26:20.714 --> 26:22.747
Well... 

26:22.748 --> 26:25.228
I want to do something with you
that you haven't done with her.

26:25.985 --> 26:28.319
We do that all the time.

26:28.320 --> 26:29.987
Well, then, I want to do something else.

26:29.988 --> 26:31.223
Something else like what?

26:33.359 --> 26:35.726
Are you saying you want a favor from me?

26:35.727 --> 26:37.795
I hope you don't mean
some sort of sexual favor.

26:37.796 --> 26:39.096
I didn't say I wanted a favor.

26:39.097 --> 26:40.964
I don't want a favor from
you, sexual or otherwise.

26:40.965 --> 26:43.435
Well, you already got a sexual
favor from me, if I recall.

26:43.436 --> 26:47.005
That wasn't a favor. You wanted
to do that just as much as I did.

26:47.006 --> 26:49.072
- And you thought it was great.
- Eh... 

26:49.073 --> 26:51.277
It was so good you thought
you killed your own father.

26:51.278 --> 26:53.878
(SCOFFS) I know. How stupid was that?

26:53.879 --> 26:55.713
Just so you know, I... 

26:55.714 --> 26:58.117
I am open to having the same
kind of sex we were having before.

26:58.118 --> 26:59.884
- If you insist.
- (CHUCKLES)

27:02.121 --> 27:06.121
- What did you want to tell me?
- I wanted to say that I... 

27:06.358 --> 27:08.694
- This isn't the right place.
- Tell me.

27:08.695 --> 27:10.895
I've been an idiot.

27:10.896 --> 27:13.931
I never realized how much
I love you, and... (SIGHS)

27:13.932 --> 27:15.734
and how much I wanted to be with you.

27:15.735 --> 27:18.770
Um, what made you realize that? Your dad?

27:18.771 --> 27:20.672
Yeah. Well... 

27:20.673 --> 27:23.808
- Guess he likes me better than Grace.
- So do I.

27:23.809 --> 27:24.930
What are you thinking about?

27:25.978 --> 27:27.011
Nothing.

27:29.281 --> 27:32.050
(SIGHING) We're gonna be friends, right?

27:32.918 --> 27:34.018
Best of friends.

27:34.954 --> 27:36.020
Bye, Jack.

27:38.057 --> 27:39.090
Bye, Grace.

27:40.159 --> 27:41.993
- It's been fun.
- Yeah.

It's okay to be alone.

Even if you're not a Christian,
God loves you. Pray with me.

Are you sure that's what
you really want, Jack?

You want God to love you?

Are you sure you don't want me to love you?

29:22.161 --> 29:24.796
You'll find someone else. So go.

Go be a father, go be a
Christian, go be whatever you want.

just like I always have.

29:33.806 --> 29:35.975
I don't need you. And I don't need them.

29:40.045 --> 29:42.447
Could you use some company?

29:43.782 --> 29:45.717
You know, I could.

29:59.331 --> 30:03.067
- Mom, I... 
- It's okay, Adrian. I know.

30:04.803 --> 30:07.905
- You know what?
- That you're pregnant.

30:07.906 --> 30:09.227
MINISTER: You may kiss the bride.

30:11.677 --> 30:13.879
- Is something wrong?
- I don't know.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.916
Something just... just doesn't feel right.

30:19.852 --> 30:23.888
I didn't do anything wrong.
That's what they told me.

30:23.889 --> 30:25.824
The doctor said I didn't... (SOBBING)

30:25.825 --> 30:28.793
I didn't do anything wrong. (SOBBING)

30:28.794 --> 30:31.094
(YELLING) She was my daughter, too!

30:31.095 --> 30:33.330
And this was my daughter's nursery!

30:33.331 --> 30:34.898
How could you take everything out of here

30:34.899 --> 30:36.419
without saying anything to me, Adrian?

30:40.005 --> 30:41.406
(SOBBING)

30:51.216 --> 30:53.937
Made you forget about your old
boyfriend for a few seconds, didn't I?

30:54.820 --> 30:56.722
Not your husband, your old boyfriend.

30:57.956 --> 30:59.636
You know I just ruined him for you, right?

31:00.392 --> 31:01.894
'Cause if you ever kiss him again,

31:03.062 --> 31:04.423
you're gonna be thinking about me.

31:05.764 --> 31:07.699
I don't think I want to be engaged.

31:09.802 --> 31:10.803
I want the ring back.

31:14.139 --> 31:15.706
(KNOCKING)

31:18.143 --> 31:19.677
Who is it?

31:19.678 --> 31:20.838
OMAR: Who do you think it is?

31:46.772 --> 31:49.132
I told you I bought you some
luggage, right? (CLEARS THROAT)

31:51.009 --> 31:52.910
Right.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.446
You can get into school in New York.

31:56.148 --> 31:57.849
Let's go.

31:57.850 --> 31:58.950
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

32:09.428 --> 32:11.029
There's just something so

32:11.797 --> 32:13.698
right about a first love.

32:14.199 --> 32:15.833
Wrong.

32:15.834 --> 32:17.667
Sometimes, it's just infatuation.

32:17.668 --> 32:19.371
I mean, not in my case, but sometimes.

32:22.908 --> 32:24.041
(SIGHING)

32:25.777 --> 32:27.146
(STAMMERING) I've had a good life, Ben.

32:27.147 --> 32:28.713
I've been lucky.

32:28.714 --> 32:31.014
But, I haven't always gotten what I wanted.

32:31.015 --> 32:34.086
- And I'm still happy.
- What did you ever want that you didn't get?

32:34.087 --> 32:35.720
Your mom.

32:35.721 --> 32:37.055
I wanted your mom to live.

32:38.857 --> 32:42.393
But accepting reality leads to
being free of judgment as, uh,

32:42.394 --> 32:43.929
what should be or shouldn't be.

32:43.930 --> 32:45.663
And that,

32:45.664 --> 32:46.904
that's what leads to happiness.

32:47.833 --> 32:48.733
That and Amy.

32:50.769 --> 32:53.704
- Goodnight, son.
- (SIGHS) Goodnight, Yoda.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.072
I'll Yoda you.

32:56.842 --> 32:58.276
(LAUGHS)

32:58.277 --> 32:59.944
Love you. I love you!

33:03.681 --> 33:05.316
Please don't be mad at me.

33:06.317 --> 33:07.917
Don't be mad at me. (SNIFFLING)

33:07.918 --> 33:09.687
Oh, my God, Amy! Don't be mad at you?

33:09.688 --> 33:12.923
And it's angry by the way, not mad! Angry!

33:12.924 --> 33:13.590
Okay.

33:14.626 --> 33:16.927
Don't be angry with me.

33:16.928 --> 33:19.569
I am angry with you! And I have a
good reason to be angry with you!

33:20.165 --> 33:22.466
You can't do this! You can't!

33:22.467 --> 33:25.335
Um, no, I can.

33:27.238 --> 33:28.305
And I have to.

33:30.871 --> 33:33.240
(SNIFFLING) I have to call it off, Ricky.

33:34.038 --> 33:35.247
I can't go through with it!

33:36.014 --> 33:37.080
(WHISPERING) You're insane!

33:37.081 --> 33:41.249
I've given you every opportunity to get
out of this wedding and you insisted!

33:41.250 --> 33:42.850
You insisted we go through with it!

33:42.851 --> 33:44.151
We're gonna go through with it!

33:44.152 --> 33:45.792
I'm gonna make you go through with it!

33:53.396 --> 33:56.365
(SOBBING) What am I saying?

33:59.502 --> 34:03.138
We're not going to go through with it
because you don't want to go through with it.

34:03.139 --> 34:04.841
And you know what? Neither do I!

34:07.210 --> 34:09.478
(STAMMERING) I hate you.

34:09.478 --> 34:12.581
If you're going to be like that,
then I hate you, too! (SOBBING)

34:12.583 --> 34:15.117
What do you hate me for? Hmm?

34:15.118 --> 34:18.987
I changed my whole life
for you! I'm a great guy!

34:18.987 --> 34:21.524
I don't cheat on you, I
take care of you and John,

34:21.525 --> 34:25.360
- and I'm responsible and... 
- You're not in love with me.

34:25.360 --> 34:28.360
(SOBBING) If that's what you were going
to say. You are not in love with me.

34:30.366 --> 34:34.302
- I love you, Amy.
- I know that you love me, Ricky,

34:34.303 --> 34:36.905
but you aren't in love with me.

34:36.906 --> 34:39.074
You're just marrying me because of John.

34:41.454 --> 34:42.755
What difference does that make?

34:43.822 --> 34:45.424
All the difference in the world.

34:49.061 --> 34:50.661
Hi, Ricky, it's me, Amy.

34:50.661 --> 34:52.996
I just wanted to tell you
that I'm at the hospital.

34:52.998 --> 34:54.899
- I didn't know is someone had called you.
- No.

34:54.900 --> 34:57.003
Why are you at the
hospital? Is everything okay?

34:57.004 --> 35:00.505
Everything's fine.
(LAUGHING) The baby's coming.

35:00.506 --> 35:01.906
I didn't know if you wanted
me to be there or not.

35:01.907 --> 35:03.507
We never really talked about it.

35:03.508 --> 35:06.012
I think you should be here. He's your son.

35:34.607 --> 35:35.774
(BABY WHIMPERING)

35:37.910 --> 35:39.511
Hi, John.

35:39.512 --> 35:40.645
Daddy's here.

35:41.881 --> 35:43.315
I love you.

35:47.420 --> 35:48.654
Lock up when you leave.

35:49.388 --> 35:51.423
Mr. Boykewich.

35:51.424 --> 35:53.826
- I don't know what to say.
- Say "Thank you".

35:54.894 --> 35:56.461
Thank you.

35:56.462 --> 35:58.729
If I had planned on
taking advantage of you,

35:58.730 --> 36:01.632
I would have had a condom
with me. But, I didn't.

36:01.633 --> 36:02.802
Because I didn't plan it.

36:03.869 --> 36:05.771
So, this isn't all my fault, you know.

36:07.907 --> 36:09.709
That's why I'm so angry all the time.

36:11.911 --> 36:13.511
Angry at myself.

36:13.512 --> 36:15.547
- And you.
- And the world.

36:15.548 --> 36:18.850
- Stupid, stupid, stupid thing to do.
- Yeah.

36:20.386 --> 36:22.722
Let's make sure our son doesn't pay for it.

36:23.823 --> 36:25.783
Would you and John like
to go out with me tonight?

36:26.359 --> 36:28.393
We would love to.

36:28.394 --> 36:29.462
I'll see you around 7:00.

36:36.769 --> 36:38.003
Amy Juergens,

36:39.505 --> 36:41.574
- will you marry me?
- (LAUGHING) Yes.

36:41.575 --> 36:43.775
(APPLAUSE)

36:43.776 --> 36:46.844
See, things have changed. Things
have changed for the better.

36:46.845 --> 36:48.814
Trouble that started here is over.

36:48.815 --> 36:52.817
Bad thing became a good thing
that became you, me and John.

36:52.818 --> 36:55.519
Yeah. I'm gonna do my best
to make the rest of our lives

36:55.520 --> 36:56.956
happy and as much fun as I can.

37:01.861 --> 37:03.928
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, too.

37:05.898 --> 37:07.899
I tried.

37:07.900 --> 37:10.870
- What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna call everyone

37:11.837 --> 37:13.272
and we're gonna tell them.

37:17.576 --> 37:19.744
And then I'm going to leave.

37:19.745 --> 37:23.615
(SOBBING) And I'm going to
leave John with you this summer.

37:25.618 --> 37:29.618
And, yeah, (LAUGHING) we're just
gonna, you know see how that goes.

37:31.757 --> 37:34.026
We're just gonna have to
figure it out as we go.

37:35.928 --> 37:38.030
- All right.
- All right? (SNIFFLING)

37:39.999 --> 37:43.034
Look, Amy,

37:43.035 --> 37:46.771
we have to be friends,
real friends, to do this.

37:46.772 --> 37:47.973
To raise John together.

37:50.276 --> 37:51.710
Or raise him separately, I guess.

37:53.379 --> 37:54.479
I know.

37:55.948 --> 37:57.649
We will be friends.

37:58.884 --> 38:00.819
We are friends. (LAUGHING)

38:04.356 --> 38:06.425
After everything that we've been through,

38:08.828 --> 38:11.797
we both just deserve to be madly
in love when we get married.

38:14.567 --> 38:15.601
That's what I want.

38:19.371 --> 38:21.004
That's what I want for you.

38:21.005 --> 38:22.575
Are you madly in love with Ben?

38:23.642 --> 38:24.809
(CHUCKLING)

38:29.736 --> 38:32.171
I just don't know. I don't know
if I'm doing the right thing.

38:32.172 --> 38:33.772
Then maybe you're not.

38:33.773 --> 38:36.175
Or maybe your dad is making you feel
so guilty that you think you're not.

38:36.176 --> 38:37.709
- She's not.
- She is.

38:37.710 --> 38:40.177
There's no reason for her to be
miserable for the rest of her life.

38:40.178 --> 38:42.313
She's not miserable,
she's just aiming too high.

38:42.314 --> 38:44.382
Dad! Everyone is going
to think I'm a bad mother.

38:44.383 --> 38:47.218
- I don't want to be a bad mother!
- ANNE: You're not a bad mother.

38:47.219 --> 38:49.653
You're going to be a
well-educated, happy mother.

38:49.654 --> 38:52.156
Which you could be right here with
your happy husband and happy son.

38:52.157 --> 38:53.760
He doesn't want to be married either.

38:53.761 --> 38:57.729
- They want to get on with their lives so just let them!
- AMY: You're right.

38:57.730 --> 39:00.698
(SNIFFLING) I do. I just
want to start my new life.

39:00.699 --> 39:02.635
You know, you guys did
some selfish, stupid things

39:02.636 --> 39:06.671
and I still love you, so John
will still love me, right?

39:06.672 --> 39:08.406
We didn't know we were
selfish and stupid at the time,

39:08.407 --> 39:09.907
we didn't have our parents
to point it out to us.

39:09.908 --> 39:11.475
ANNE: John will still love you.

39:11.476 --> 39:13.611
John is never going to think
that you're a bad mother.

39:13.612 --> 39:16.414
And you're not, Amy, you're not. It's okay.

39:16.415 --> 39:18.885
You want to go to college in
New York, so go. It's okay.

39:19.752 --> 39:21.220
(SNIFFLES) Thanks, Mom.

39:23.890 --> 39:26.191
Okay. I'm okay now. Let's go.

39:26.192 --> 39:29.260
- You're sure?
- Yeah. Let's go. We have to get to the airport.

39:29.261 --> 39:30.596
(SNIFFLING) All right, but
we can't keep doing this.

39:30.597 --> 39:31.863
Yes, we can.

39:46.612 --> 39:49.681
(LOCK UNLOCKS) You know
it's just that, like,

39:49.682 --> 39:51.649
maybe I was wrong. Maybe I am in love.

39:51.650 --> 39:54.819
Or, maybe I'm never going to be in
love and maybe it doesn't matter.

39:54.820 --> 39:57.655
Ricky's a good guy, he's really a good guy.

39:57.656 --> 39:59.223
ANNE: But, that's not enough.

39:59.224 --> 40:00.458
If you don't want to
spend your life with him,

40:00.459 --> 40:02.326
you don't want to spend your life with him.

40:02.327 --> 40:05.398
And if you make yourself do that,
eventually you'll end up resenting John.

40:05.399 --> 40:06.565
Oh, bull.

40:06.566 --> 40:08.199
If she comes to her senses

40:08.200 --> 40:09.567
and goes back up there, she's
going to feel good about herself

40:09.568 --> 40:11.268
and John and Ricky are
going to feel good, too.

40:11.269 --> 40:12.937
It's all right to make this
about Amy and what she wants.

40:12.938 --> 40:14.405
No, it isn't, she has a kid.

40:14.406 --> 40:15.926
That's not some kind of life sentence.

40:17.710 --> 40:18.777
Okay.

40:19.645 --> 40:21.546
Let's go, I'm okay.

40:22.839 --> 40:24.306
I'm fine, really.

40:26.009 --> 40:28.178
I want to do this. I want to go to New York

40:28.179 --> 40:31.380
and I've said my goodbyes and I just... 

40:31.381 --> 40:33.250
I really want to do it so... 

40:33.839 --> 40:35.140
let's go.

40:35.061 --> 40:36.861
Amy, you're going to be
back in a couple of weeks.

40:36.862 --> 40:38.531
You're going to be back every
couple of weeks this summer,

40:38.532 --> 40:40.031
so, really, it's okay.

40:40.900 --> 40:41.968
I said we could go.

40:57.116 --> 41:00.585
Okay, you know what? I'll just
run up and say goodbye again.

41:00.586 --> 41:03.187
I just want Ricky to know
that I love him and John, too.

41:03.188 --> 41:05.689
It's just that if I don't
do this for myself then

41:05.690 --> 41:07.760
I will never know what I
could have done in my life.

41:08.828 --> 41:09.928
And... 

41:11.964 --> 41:15.067
Yeah, no. (STAMMERING) I
don't want to go up again.

41:17.970 --> 41:19.971
You say goodbye once and... 

41:19.972 --> 41:21.841
you know, I don't want to upset John, so... 

41:23.009 --> 41:24.010
(MURMURS) let's go.

41:33.986 --> 41:36.922
(LOCKS DOOR)

41:53.573 --> 41:55.641
"... and she lived happily ever after."

42:04.083 --> 42:05.084
So will we.
