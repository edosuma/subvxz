WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:02.812
MITCH: A year ago,
the animals started acting strangely,

00:02.836 --> 00:04.338
but no one noticed...

00:04.372 --> 00:05.406
(growling)

00:05.439 --> 00:06.583
until they began attacking,

00:06.607 --> 00:08.342
coordinating,

00:08.376 --> 00:09.377
evolving.

00:09.410 --> 00:11.245
The animals were mutating,

00:11.279 --> 00:13.057
and it was happening faster
than anyone expected.

00:13.081 --> 00:13.947
(screaming)

00:13.981 --> 00:16.250
The government came
up with a plan.

00:16.283 --> 00:17.594
PSA NARRATOR: Thanks
to the Noah Objective,

00:17.618 --> 00:20.221
in six to ten years,
the world's animal population

00:20.254 --> 00:22.523
will be thriving once again.

00:22.556 --> 00:25.593
You cannot exterminate
every animal on the planet,

00:25.626 --> 00:26.827
and then repopulate it.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.562
MITCH: But messing
with Mother Nature

00:28.596 --> 00:30.364
could be catastrophic,

00:30.398 --> 00:32.209
so a group of us are
trying to save the animals.

00:32.232 --> 00:34.635
Jackson Oz and Abraham Kenyatta,

00:34.668 --> 00:36.237
animal experts.

00:36.270 --> 00:38.772
Dariela Marzan, army ranger.

00:38.806 --> 00:40.541
Jamie Campbell,

00:40.574 --> 00:43.311
a reporter who's been
following this story, found me,

00:43.344 --> 00:46.514
Mitch Morgan,
a veterinary pathologist.

00:47.715 --> 00:50.118
Together,
we're going to find a cure

00:50.151 --> 00:51.219
for the animals.

00:51.252 --> 00:53.454
Time is running out.

00:54.455 --> 00:56.490
Previously on Zoo...

00:56.524 --> 00:59.127
FATHER PETE: They were targeting
you, Dariela. Why?

00:59.160 --> 01:02.396
Lieutenant Marzan,
I found something in your blood results.

01:02.430 --> 01:03.364
I think you love my son.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.132
Ha! I think you're crazy.

01:05.166 --> 01:08.136
Mitch.

01:10.604 --> 01:12.673
Are we still good on our deal?

01:12.706 --> 01:14.551
Put a bullet in your head if
you turn into a rage machine?

01:14.575 --> 01:16.510
Yeah, we're good.

01:16.544 --> 01:17.845
Your father gave them to me.

01:17.878 --> 01:19.513
I injected your mother.

01:19.547 --> 01:21.315
My father is dead.

01:21.349 --> 01:22.116
Your father is still alive,

01:22.150 --> 01:23.884
and he's working
with General Davies.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.786
(grunting) (glass shattering)

01:25.819 --> 01:28.189
Jackson! (gunshot)

01:33.561 --> 01:34.762
He's gone.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.169
(engine revving)

01:41.202 --> 01:42.236
(horns honking)

01:42.270 --> 01:44.672
(tires squealing)

01:47.808 --> 01:50.211
Jackson couldn't
have gotten far.

01:50.244 --> 01:51.588
You sure you don't
want me to drive?

01:51.612 --> 01:54.515
Just tell me which
way to go next.

01:54.548 --> 01:55.849
Okay, uh, Jamie, we just turned

01:55.883 --> 01:57.618
onto a street called, uh,

01:57.651 --> 01:59.253
Ra-Rakuun... something.

01:59.287 --> 02:00.188
I don't know,
there's too many vowels

02:00.221 --> 02:01.255
in this language.

02:01.289 --> 02:02.290
Rakuunantie.

02:02.323 --> 02:03.157
You're going the right way.

02:03.191 --> 02:04.892
He's just a few
miles ahead of you.

02:04.925 --> 02:07.195
How did Mitch sneak a
tracking chip into Jackson?

02:07.228 --> 02:08.668
He didn't.
Jackson put it in himself.

02:08.696 --> 02:09.696
How do you know that?

02:11.332 --> 02:13.934
Look, he just turned south.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.203
JAMIE: You hear that, Mitch?

02:15.236 --> 02:16.370
Okay, yeah. Uh, go left.

02:16.404 --> 02:17.371
(engine revs up)

02:17.405 --> 02:19.707
(car horns honking)

02:19.740 --> 02:21.020
(tires squealing,
brakes whining)

02:22.876 --> 02:25.946
(car horn honking)

02:25.979 --> 02:27.715
This is all my fault.

02:27.748 --> 02:28.816
You didn't shoot Jackson.

02:28.849 --> 02:30.218
Okay? Your girlfriend did.

02:32.686 --> 02:35.456
But if we don't find him,
we can kiss the cure good-bye.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.691
I should never have told
him about his father.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.794
His father?

02:40.828 --> 02:43.497
Robert Oz... wh-what about him?

02:43.531 --> 02:44.898
He's still alive.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.534
What?

02:46.567 --> 02:48.769
He's working with
General Davies.

02:48.802 --> 02:49.637
How do you know this?

02:49.670 --> 02:50.438
I know.

02:50.471 --> 02:52.273
And when were you
going to tell me?

02:52.306 --> 02:53.374
I'll explain later.

02:54.542 --> 02:55.709
(tires screeching)

02:58.579 --> 03:00.748
You know I'm the leader, right?

03:06.787 --> 03:07.788
(animals growling)

03:07.821 --> 03:08.922
My God!

03:08.956 --> 03:10.924
(rumbling)

03:13.961 --> 03:15.763
(hoofbeats)

03:15.796 --> 03:19.267
(animals whining and growling)

03:19.300 --> 03:20.968
(animals growling) What is that?

03:21.001 --> 03:22.303
What's happening? Mitch?

03:22.336 --> 03:24.805
(thumping and thudding)

03:24.838 --> 03:26.340
(whining and growling fade)

03:36.049 --> 03:37.618
The animals are behaving

03:37.651 --> 03:40.821
just like they
acted in Mozambique.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.692
They weren't coming after us.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.260
They were running
from something.

03:49.363 --> 03:50.363
Mitch?

03:51.999 --> 03:54.335
Yeah. We're still here.

03:54.368 --> 03:55.869
It's Jackson, he stopped.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.871
(beeping)

04:02.810 --> 04:04.778
(car monitor system beeping)

04:04.812 --> 04:05.846
Jackson?

04:05.879 --> 04:06.880
Jackson!

04:11.952 --> 04:13.821
He can't have gone far.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.055
I can find him.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.724
He can go as far
as he wants now.

04:19.091 --> 04:23.030
He clawed out his own tracker.

04:28.636 --> 04:30.638
â™ª

05:01.101 --> 05:02.570
We found the car,
but no Jackson.

05:02.603 --> 05:03.804
No sign.

05:03.837 --> 05:04.738
He's gone.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.774
I checked all the
hospitals in Helsinki,

05:06.807 --> 05:08.742
no gunshot victims.

05:08.776 --> 05:09.819
Well, I don't think
medical attention's

05:09.843 --> 05:11.011
his priority right now.

05:11.044 --> 05:13.647
I shot him in the shoulder,
it tends to sting a little.

05:13.681 --> 05:15.359
Well, you speared Kovacs
through the chest...

05:15.383 --> 05:16.417
He kept coming.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.686
Look, the mutation

05:18.719 --> 05:20.721
causes an adrenaline rush.

05:20.754 --> 05:22.098
It blocks the
transmission of pain.

05:22.122 --> 05:23.557
He's not feeling
anything right now.

05:23.591 --> 05:25.626
Jackson is not Kovacs.

05:25.659 --> 05:26.860
No. Not yet.

05:26.894 --> 05:29.096
But the brain has three levels.

05:29.129 --> 05:30.474
One controls logic,
one controls emotion.

05:30.498 --> 05:32.032
The other is reptilian.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.767
Right now his
reptilian instincts

05:33.801 --> 05:35.836
are completely
overriding the logic.

05:35.869 --> 05:36.904
Fight or flight.

05:38.406 --> 05:39.873
We need to find him now.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.776
The Noah Objective is days away,

05:42.810 --> 05:44.478
and we still need
a saber-tooth cat.

05:44.512 --> 05:45.979
Aren't those extinct?

05:46.013 --> 05:47.781
Not on an island called Pangea.

05:47.815 --> 05:49.883
But we can't do anything
without Jackson.

05:49.917 --> 05:51.585
Because he's the incubator?

05:51.619 --> 05:52.829
MITCH: Yes. I've been working on

05:52.853 --> 05:54.388
an anti-rejection drug,

05:54.422 --> 05:56.824
just in case his body
can't handle the cure.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.126
I mean,
I'm going to be introducing seven

05:59.159 --> 06:01.395
genomic fossils into his DNA.

06:01.429 --> 06:03.464
If his body rejects
it, no more cure.

06:03.497 --> 06:05.566
I think I know where he is.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.671
He'd want to find his father.

06:10.704 --> 06:11.881
Get answers as to
why he gave Jackson

06:11.905 --> 06:13.707
the ghost gene in
the first place.

06:15.175 --> 06:16.844
We need Davies.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.011
He knows where Robert Oz is.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.122
ALLISON: General Davies
is in Washington.

06:19.146 --> 06:21.815
He's prepping for
the TX Gas Launch.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.984
I just got an update,
but with commercial flights

06:24.017 --> 06:26.019
suspended,
Jackson won't get his hands on him

06:26.053 --> 06:27.555
unless he swims the Atlantic.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.133
Well,
the only way out of the country

06:30.157 --> 06:31.091
is by airplane,

06:31.124 --> 06:32.893
and the only planes
leaving are military.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.895
He could be going
to a nearby base.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.130
We need footage from there.

06:38.165 --> 06:38.766
Can you get that?

06:38.799 --> 06:41.702
Sure, I'll send an order.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.047
Great.
Then we'll get to that base.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.205
Not so fast. I need you here.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.140
What is more important
than Jackson?

06:47.174 --> 06:48.609
Mass genocide.

06:48.642 --> 06:50.678
Dariela said that the
horses ignored everyone

06:50.711 --> 06:53.881
that she was traveling
with, but came after her.

06:53.914 --> 06:54.882
That means they could
all have the ghost gene.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.784
A lot more people could
die than we thought.

07:01.121 --> 07:02.856
Look, maybe I was wrong.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.067
There could be another reason.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.626
What reason could that be?

07:05.659 --> 07:07.060
Don't know.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.096
I'm not the scientist.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.141
Allison,
what do you want me to do?

07:12.165 --> 07:13.701
Look, Russia is
thinking of pulling out

07:13.734 --> 07:14.868
of The Noah Objective,

07:14.902 --> 07:16.169
but Davies needs their airspace

07:16.203 --> 07:17.471
to launch the gas.

07:17.505 --> 07:18.572
I don't speak Russian.

07:18.606 --> 07:19.640
No, you speak science.

07:19.673 --> 07:20.641
I need you to come with me

07:20.674 --> 07:21.718
to the embassy and convince

07:21.742 --> 07:22.743
the minister of defense

07:22.776 --> 07:24.077
that we're close to a cure.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.846
Without Jackson,
there is no cure,

07:25.879 --> 07:26.923
so I'm going to go get
him, okay?

07:26.947 --> 07:28.448
No. No, you're not.

07:29.783 --> 07:30.951
Watch me.

07:41.529 --> 07:45.566
REPORTER: Various provinces in
Argentina, Mendoza, Cordoba, San Juan,

07:45.599 --> 07:48.135
and in a very small town
in the northern province...

07:52.239 --> 07:54.575
Can I have a word?

07:54.608 --> 07:56.844
I didn't think you were
still speaking to me.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.245
I did just shoot
your best friend.

07:58.278 --> 08:02.082
In the shoulder.

08:02.115 --> 08:04.284
I know you could have
taken a kill-shot.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.787
Thank you for sparing him,

08:06.820 --> 08:08.188
and for saving my life.

08:09.189 --> 08:10.924
Someone had to.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.795
I'm going to ask
you to do something,

08:14.828 --> 08:16.005
and you're not going to like it.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.064
Cut the preamble.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.065
Just tell me.

08:18.098 --> 08:19.633
Stay here.

08:19.667 --> 08:22.235
Don't come looking
for Jackson with us.

08:22.269 --> 08:23.637
You think I'm a liability

08:23.671 --> 08:25.214
'cause the animals
were targeting me? No.

08:25.238 --> 08:28.008
The animals are
targeting all of us.

08:28.041 --> 08:28.976
It's not the animals

08:29.009 --> 08:31.612
I'm afraid of... it's Jackson.

08:31.645 --> 08:35.649
I don't know what
he's capable of.

08:38.619 --> 08:41.822
Fine, I'll stay.

08:41.855 --> 08:45.693
That was easy.

08:47.194 --> 08:50.564
I thought for sure
you'd put up a fight.

08:50.598 --> 08:54.067
I didn't come back for a fight.

08:54.101 --> 08:56.970
Then why did you come back?

09:07.114 --> 09:09.583
Ever since I joined the army,

09:09.617 --> 09:13.153
I've considered my
unit to be my family.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.188
Now...

09:15.222 --> 09:16.556
you guys are my unit.

09:18.358 --> 09:20.193
There's nowhere
else I need to be.

09:34.207 --> 09:35.218
NEWSCASTER: Breaking
news out of Finland.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.210
An unidentified man

09:37.244 --> 09:39.312
has gone on a violent rampage

09:39.346 --> 09:40.748
at Helsinki Central Hospital.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.816
It's unclear what
motivated the attack,

09:42.850 --> 09:44.618
but numerous injuries
have been reported

09:44.652 --> 09:46.687
and the man is still at large.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.856
Authorities are
considering him unarmed,

09:48.889 --> 09:49.923
yet extremely dangerous.

09:49.957 --> 09:50.891
It can't be...

09:50.924 --> 09:53.627
We'll bring you more
details as we get them.

09:53.661 --> 09:55.696
This is bad.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.965
I can't believe he did that.
He must've had a reason.

09:57.998 --> 09:58.999
Reason? (air door closes)

09:59.032 --> 10:01.068
You know what his reason
would've been? What?

10:01.101 --> 10:02.803
That he is no longer
capable of reasoning.

10:02.836 --> 10:04.013
He ran because of
what I told him,

10:04.037 --> 10:05.281
not because of the mutation.
(alarm buzzes, hatch opens)

10:05.305 --> 10:08.408
Abe, you've got to get something
through that big skull of yours.

10:08.441 --> 10:11.078
What we're gonna be looking for

10:11.111 --> 10:12.155
isn't your friend
Jackson anymore.

10:12.179 --> 10:13.814
(hatch clanks)

10:13.847 --> 10:15.916
We're hunting an animal.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.802
PETER: Welcome back
to The Conversation.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.336
If you're just joining
us, our guest tonight,

10:27.360 --> 10:28.796
General Andrew Davies.

10:28.829 --> 10:33.066
Executive Director of
the Noah Objective.

10:33.100 --> 10:33.934
General, before the break,

10:33.967 --> 10:34.868
you were explaining
to our audience

10:34.902 --> 10:37.270
how the TX-14 gas
would be distributed.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.972
Yes, it's very simple
really, Peter.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.207
Our, uh, top scientists

10:40.240 --> 10:42.442
have pinpointed very
specific dispersal sites

10:42.475 --> 10:43.811
all across the planet.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.178
And why these locations?

10:45.212 --> 10:46.947
Well, they allow for
the gas to be launched

10:46.980 --> 10:48.181
into the upper atmosphere,

10:48.215 --> 10:50.083
where it can be spread
for thousands of miles

10:50.117 --> 10:54.054
using both the polar and
the subtropical jet streams.

10:54.087 --> 10:56.099
And this, in turn,
allows for the gas to saturate the air

10:56.123 --> 10:56.890
at equal volume.

10:56.924 --> 10:59.192
I see.
Now, in the United States,

10:59.226 --> 11:01.228
Boston and Los Angeles
have been chosen,

11:01.261 --> 11:03.797
but residents there are
clearly not very happy,

11:03.831 --> 11:05.098
as evident by many protests.

11:05.132 --> 11:07.200
I want to assure everyone

11:07.234 --> 11:09.737
that the TX-14 gas

11:09.770 --> 11:12.239
is 100% safe for humans.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.107
And you're saying there
are no side effects?

11:14.141 --> 11:16.309
None whatsoever.
This is the perfect solution

11:16.343 --> 11:18.278
to our animal problem,
which you'll all

11:18.311 --> 11:19.913
be able to see in three days.

11:19.947 --> 11:21.915
Well, now, there are rumors
circulating, General,

11:21.949 --> 11:23.426
that Russia, which,
of course, occupies

11:23.450 --> 11:25.886
the world's largest land
mass, may pull out

11:25.919 --> 11:27.988
of the Noah Objective.
Those are just rumors, Peter.

11:28.021 --> 11:28.856
I wouldn't pay them any mind.

11:28.889 --> 11:31.224
Yes, but if this were to
happen, General,

11:31.258 --> 11:33.060
would you still be
able to move proceed?

11:33.093 --> 11:35.963
Peter, Russia has always
been a big supporter

11:35.996 --> 11:37.130
of the Noah Objective.

11:37.164 --> 11:41.001
And we are very grateful
to them for that.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.169
(indistinct conversations)

11:42.202 --> 11:44.738
What do you mean you can't
get the minister of defense

11:44.772 --> 11:46.006
on the phone? He's unavailable.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.083
I've known Leonid
Ivankov for years.

11:47.107 --> 11:48.441
He better make
himself available.

11:48.475 --> 11:51.144
(phone rings) Sir, let me remind
you that we have a bigger problem

11:51.178 --> 11:53.213
than Russia. I'm aware.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.382
Yes?

11:55.415 --> 11:57.084
That's excellent news.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.085
What is it?

11:58.118 --> 12:00.120
We may have found Jackson Oz.

12:10.197 --> 12:11.832
Any luck?

12:11.865 --> 12:13.166
Nothing.

12:19.372 --> 12:21.208
I know you saw Mitch and I.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.986
With what's going on right
now with Jackson, you want

12:23.010 --> 12:25.212
to take a time-out to
discuss office romance?

12:25.245 --> 12:27.180
This mission means more
to me than Mitch Morgan,

12:27.214 --> 12:30.250
so just say the word
and I will back off.

12:32.585 --> 12:35.255
He's all yours.

12:35.288 --> 12:37.057
Hey, ladies.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.491
We've got a problem.

12:38.525 --> 12:41.228
The Russian minister of
defense is in our kitchen.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.830
Leonid Ivankov?

12:42.863 --> 12:43.964
Thought his name was...

12:43.997 --> 12:45.241
(Russian accent):
get me Mitch Morgan.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.200
What's he doing here?
He wants proof

12:47.234 --> 12:50.203
that we're working on an
alternate to the Noah Objective.

12:50.237 --> 12:51.271
But without Mitch...

12:51.304 --> 12:53.440
Can't we just have him
wait until Mitch gets back?

12:53.473 --> 12:55.208
No, we need Russia

12:55.242 --> 12:57.410
on our side, but that doesn't
mean that I trust them.

12:57.444 --> 13:00.480
Ivankov can't know
about Jackson.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.215
Why? Learning that

13:02.249 --> 13:04.317
the mutation has jumped
to humans could make him

13:04.351 --> 13:06.219
side with the Noah Objective.

13:06.253 --> 13:07.220
We have one chance.

13:07.254 --> 13:10.123
Oh, no pressure.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.193
Hello.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.195
Hello, Ms. Shaw.
Minister Ivankov,

13:15.228 --> 13:17.297
what a surprise.
Dr. Morgan and I were going to

13:17.330 --> 13:19.366
come to you.
I had to see this for myself.

13:19.399 --> 13:20.834
Your team.

13:20.868 --> 13:22.970
What you do here.

13:23.003 --> 13:24.537
Tell me, where is Dr. Morgan?

13:29.509 --> 13:31.144
There's an animal we
need for the cure.

13:31.178 --> 13:32.612
He's out hunting it.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.247
And you are?

13:34.281 --> 13:35.849
Jamie Campbell.

13:35.883 --> 13:38.085
Ah, you are the girl
with the leopard.

13:38.118 --> 13:40.153
You had the cure. But it failed.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.056
Yes.

13:43.090 --> 13:44.267
But we're close to another one.

13:44.291 --> 13:45.926
When Mitch gets
back, he'll show you.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.928
There is no time.

13:47.961 --> 13:50.230
The gas will be
released in three days.

13:50.263 --> 13:52.900
With no alternative,
the Noah Objective

13:52.933 --> 13:55.002
appears to be the most
effective way to end this.

13:55.035 --> 13:57.237
Davies is lying to you.

13:57.270 --> 13:58.271
So are you, Ms. Campbell.

13:58.305 --> 13:59.572
You're not being honest

13:59.606 --> 14:02.242
about Dr. Morgan's whereabouts.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.381
What don't you want me to know?

14:08.415 --> 14:10.150
I have nothing to hide.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.652
We'll see about that.

14:12.685 --> 14:16.156
I need to speak to Ms.
Campbell in private.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.591
I don't think so, Sputnik.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.394
I got this.

14:25.632 --> 14:27.034
Okay.

14:33.473 --> 14:35.475
(sirens wailing,
indistinct chatter)

14:41.348 --> 14:42.682
I can't believe this.

14:42.715 --> 14:46.186
Told you. His primal
instincts have taken over.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.430
Mitch,
you don't know that for sure.

14:47.454 --> 14:49.289
(speaks Finnish)

14:49.322 --> 14:50.290
What?

14:50.323 --> 14:51.959
You cannot enter here.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.328
Really? 'Cause this says we can.

14:55.362 --> 14:58.231
Were there any fatalities?
Thankfully, no.

14:58.265 --> 15:01.068
He only injured those
who tried to stop him.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.269
Okay, well, what happened?

15:02.302 --> 15:03.971
Witnesses said he
moved with purpose,

15:04.004 --> 15:05.572
like he was looking
for something.

15:05.605 --> 15:08.108
Or someone. It took 11 minutes

15:08.141 --> 15:09.542
for the poliisi to respond.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.312
In that time,
he locked himself in a room.

15:12.345 --> 15:13.981
By the time we
arrived, he was gone.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.983
Room? What room?

15:16.016 --> 15:17.684
A lab.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.052
Can you show us the lab?

15:19.086 --> 15:21.088
Follow me.

15:36.736 --> 15:38.338
What's his job?

15:38.371 --> 15:39.639
His job is to watch.

15:39.672 --> 15:41.441
Now...

15:42.342 --> 15:44.111
place your arms on the table.

15:44.144 --> 15:45.979
Seriously?
Your pulse doesn't lie,

15:46.013 --> 15:47.380
even if you do.

15:58.091 --> 16:00.593
You said you were
close to a cure.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.362
How do you know that?

16:02.395 --> 16:05.198
We found a way to take
specific animals that have...

16:05.232 --> 16:06.466
Bear with me...

16:06.499 --> 16:10.037
A Triple-Helix DNA strand

16:10.070 --> 16:13.706
and use their genomic
fossils to synthesize a cure.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.414
(speaking Russian)

16:24.184 --> 16:26.286
(speaking Russian)

16:30.823 --> 16:33.393
And how many of these
Triple-Helix animals

16:33.426 --> 16:34.727
do you need to make a cure?

16:34.761 --> 16:37.664
Seven. We have six.

16:37.697 --> 16:40.567
But the last one is
proving hard to get.

16:42.369 --> 16:44.204
(speaking Russian)

16:44.237 --> 16:47.074
(speaking Russian)

16:48.441 --> 16:50.377
I don't know what you're saying.

16:50.410 --> 16:53.046
But we are close
to finding a cure.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.614
If you let the Noah Objective

16:54.647 --> 16:57.617
go forward,
the gas will kill millions of people.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.352
And Davies knows it.

16:59.386 --> 17:01.121
That's what he's hiding.

17:07.194 --> 17:09.128
And how do you know this?

17:09.162 --> 17:10.530
We've accessed his files.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.201
This team of yours...

17:14.233 --> 17:16.336
Why won't you let me know
where they really are?

17:16.368 --> 17:18.338
They're hunting for
an animal we need.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.473
And what animal is that?

17:26.813 --> 17:28.515
A man.

17:30.217 --> 17:32.252
A member of our team.

17:45.465 --> 17:46.799
(speaking Russian)

18:06.419 --> 18:09.556
Nothing Jackson is doing
is making any sense.

18:09.589 --> 18:12.659
I think you were right.

18:12.692 --> 18:16.196
Maybe he's not all gone yet.

18:23.503 --> 18:24.503
Look at this.

18:25.605 --> 18:28.175
All these blood
trays are filled.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.642
Except for this one.

18:31.244 --> 18:34.281
Jackson's mutating into an apex
predator, not a vampire.

18:34.314 --> 18:35.458
Besides,
how could you possibly know

18:35.482 --> 18:37.284
if Jackson took that
vial and it wasn't

18:37.317 --> 18:39.286
some doctor that
removed it earlier?

18:39.319 --> 18:41.654
It's called a hunch.

18:45.292 --> 18:48.328
Okay. Whose blood is it?

18:48.361 --> 18:49.462
I don't know,

18:49.496 --> 18:51.831
but they're all labeled
with identification numbers

18:51.864 --> 18:53.576
and they're chronological,
so all I have to do

18:53.600 --> 18:56.569
is type in the number between

18:56.603 --> 18:58.605
those two...

18:58.638 --> 19:00.640
and...

19:02.909 --> 19:05.345
Vera Salvon.

19:05.378 --> 19:06.879
That name mean anything to you?

19:06.913 --> 19:08.548
It does not. Why would Jackson

19:08.581 --> 19:10.583
want her blood?

19:13.553 --> 19:15.555
Well, there's an address.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.590
Let's go find out.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.569
I've got eyes on his friends,

19:29.602 --> 19:31.238
but no sign of him.

19:31.271 --> 19:33.540
Stay on 'em.
Let them lead you to Jackson Oz

19:33.573 --> 19:34.941
and then you bring 'em to me.

19:54.527 --> 19:55.995
It is a scary thing to realize

19:56.028 --> 19:58.965
the mutation has
jumped to humans.

19:58.998 --> 20:01.468
All the more reason
to find this cure.

20:03.470 --> 20:04.947
Does this mean you're
withdrawing support

20:04.971 --> 20:06.539
for the Noah Objective?

20:06.573 --> 20:08.007
Yes. We corroborated your story.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.809
That's great news.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.544
Hold the celebration.

20:11.578 --> 20:13.980
I must convince the
cabinet of ministers.

20:14.013 --> 20:17.684
They're meeting in
Washington in two days.

20:17.717 --> 20:20.420
They need to be
told that TX-14 gas

20:20.453 --> 20:22.389
will cause human casualties.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.457
Well, can you convince them?

20:24.491 --> 20:26.293
We will stop the Noah Objective,

20:26.326 --> 20:27.460
with your help.

20:27.494 --> 20:29.862
Wait, you...

20:29.896 --> 20:33.666
you said that you
corroborated my story.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.269
Who did you corroborate it with?
Everything you said

20:36.303 --> 20:38.004
lined up with a Noah
Objective scientist

20:38.037 --> 20:39.706
we spoke with two days ago.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.474
Triple-Helix, genomic fossils.

20:41.508 --> 20:42.809
Scientist?

20:42.842 --> 20:44.477
Yes. What scientist?

20:44.511 --> 20:46.513
His name is Dr. Robert Oz.

20:48.681 --> 20:50.317
I need to talk to him.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.451
Do you know where he is?

20:51.484 --> 20:53.953
No. We spoke on a secure line.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.288
Was it traceable?

20:55.322 --> 20:56.723
By definition, the secure lines

20:56.756 --> 20:58.291
are not traceable.

20:59.859 --> 21:00.993
But in Russia...

21:02.395 --> 21:04.464
we trace everything.

21:15.908 --> 21:17.944
Robert Oz? You sure?

21:17.977 --> 21:19.646
That's what Ivankov said.

21:19.679 --> 21:22.349
We're gonna try to trace the
call, get a location.

21:22.382 --> 21:23.516
How's it going on your end?

21:23.550 --> 21:24.751
Hard to say.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.753
Jackson seems to
be very interested

21:26.786 --> 21:29.456
in a Finnish woman
named Vera Salvon.

21:29.489 --> 21:31.358
Why?

21:31.391 --> 21:32.492
We have no idea.

21:32.525 --> 21:33.693
Well, keep me posted.

21:33.726 --> 21:35.428
And Mitch...

21:35.462 --> 21:37.029
you guys be careful.

21:37.063 --> 21:38.965
Yeah.

21:45.872 --> 21:47.640
Was that Mitch?

21:48.508 --> 21:50.377
Yeah.

21:50.410 --> 21:52.412
Where, um, almost ready.

21:53.413 --> 21:55.448
What is this thing again?

21:55.482 --> 21:56.516
A SCIF room.

21:56.549 --> 21:58.885
A Sensitive Compartmented
Information Facility.

22:00.520 --> 22:03.089
You bring this stuff with
you when you travel? Yes.

22:03.122 --> 22:06.025
For security.
Calls can't be traced, computers

22:06.058 --> 22:07.594
can't be hacked.

22:07.627 --> 22:09.896
From a surveillance
standpoint, it's impenetrable.

22:09.929 --> 22:11.931
Unless, of course,
you are inside.

22:21.941 --> 22:25.678
(door creaks open)

22:25.712 --> 22:28.481
Hello? Jackson?

22:28.515 --> 22:31.050
MITCH: Ms. Salvon?

22:37.590 --> 22:38.658
Power's out.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.660
Do you think that's
a coincidence?

22:40.693 --> 22:43.596
Well, not if somebody doesn't
want to be seen or found.

22:47.166 --> 22:49.502
You want to take downstairs?

22:49.536 --> 22:51.804
Do you think it's
wise to split up?

22:51.838 --> 22:55.442
Not at all,
but if Jackson is here,

22:55.475 --> 22:57.810
I don't want to be close
by when he sees you.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.606
(floorboards creaking)

23:43.823 --> 23:45.758
(bird singing) Son of a...!

23:45.792 --> 23:47.594
(gasps)

23:47.627 --> 23:49.195
(bird singing)

23:49.228 --> 23:50.530
(sighs)

23:50.563 --> 23:52.565
What's going on? Who keeps a pet

23:52.599 --> 23:54.042
in the middle of an
animal apocalypse?

23:54.066 --> 23:56.569
A 70-year-old
broad with no life.

23:56.603 --> 23:57.604
(bird singing)

23:57.637 --> 23:59.205
Did you find anything?

23:59.238 --> 24:01.841
No. Just some bloody tissue.

24:01.874 --> 24:05.011
ABRAHAM: Look.
There's blood on his feathers, too.

24:05.044 --> 24:06.154
Looks like old Vera got attacked

24:06.178 --> 24:09.716
by the only family she has.

24:09.749 --> 24:11.017
God, life sucks, huh?

24:11.050 --> 24:13.152
But none of this means anything.

24:13.185 --> 24:16.055
You were the one saying
Jackson's still human, right?

24:16.088 --> 24:17.557
If he is, he's got to be

24:17.590 --> 24:18.558
doing this for a reason.

24:18.591 --> 24:19.668
Well, take a look around you.

24:19.692 --> 24:21.193
It's just an ordinary old lady.

24:21.227 --> 24:23.038
Nothing special about her.
Nothing Jackson would want.

24:23.062 --> 24:25.632
Why are we here?

24:25.665 --> 24:27.667
Hey, we'll figure it out, okay?
Relax.

24:27.700 --> 24:29.502
Easy for you to say.

24:29.536 --> 24:31.504
You're not the reason
we're in this mess.

24:31.538 --> 24:35.642
All right, I'm getting tired
of your little self-pity party.

24:35.675 --> 24:37.176
(bird singing)

24:37.209 --> 24:38.878
This isn't your fault.

24:38.911 --> 24:40.947
You making me leave
Jamie in New Brunswick?

24:40.980 --> 24:42.749
That's your fault.

24:42.782 --> 24:44.717
This? Not your fault.

24:44.751 --> 24:47.654
You and I know I'm the
reason why we're here.

24:47.687 --> 24:51.591
If I hadn't had lied to
Jackson all these years.

24:51.624 --> 24:53.926
You're probably right.

24:55.194 --> 24:59.632
(bird screeching)

24:59.666 --> 25:01.968
Look, I'm not the only one
who's angry in this room.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.836
He's not angry.

25:03.870 --> 25:05.838
(singing)

25:05.872 --> 25:07.974
He's scared.

25:08.007 --> 25:10.276
Thought there was
anger we saw earlier.

25:10.309 --> 25:11.744
(screeching continues)

25:11.778 --> 25:12.812
Jackson's here.

25:12.845 --> 25:15.615
(screeching continues)

25:15.648 --> 25:17.850
(rattling, footsteps running)

25:17.884 --> 25:18.350
Jackson!

25:18.384 --> 25:20.853
(bird screeching)

25:20.887 --> 25:23.155
(bird trilling)

25:23.189 --> 25:24.824
ABRAHAM: Jackson?!

25:24.857 --> 25:25.958
(car engine starting)

25:25.992 --> 25:27.794
Jackson!

25:27.827 --> 25:31.263
(tires squealing,
engine revving)

25:31.297 --> 25:33.199
Jackson. (Panting)

25:33.232 --> 25:35.201
Get your hands up.

25:36.202 --> 25:38.638
Where is your friend going?

25:40.873 --> 25:42.942
(loud squawking)

25:42.975 --> 25:46.178
(grunting)

25:46.212 --> 25:48.280
Tell us who sent you!

25:48.314 --> 25:49.916
Tell us who sent you!

25:49.949 --> 25:52.218
(bird singing)

25:52.251 --> 25:53.786
I'd tell him if I were you.

25:54.887 --> 25:56.823
(panting)

25:56.856 --> 25:59.759
General Davies.

26:00.893 --> 26:02.895
(grunts)

26:02.929 --> 26:04.864
Okay. Let's go.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.766
He's too far ahead.
We'll never find him.

26:06.799 --> 26:08.935
We won't...

26:09.936 --> 26:11.137
but he will.

26:14.707 --> 26:16.709
(bird singing)

26:19.646 --> 26:20.947
(beeping, trilling)

26:20.980 --> 26:24.116
(dialing)

26:24.150 --> 26:26.886
(line ringing)

26:26.919 --> 26:28.254
Pick up the phone.

26:30.122 --> 26:32.258
ROBERT: Hello?

26:32.291 --> 26:34.661
Dr. Robert Oz?

26:37.329 --> 26:39.732
If this is Dr. Robert Oz,

26:39.766 --> 26:41.000
please don't hang up.

26:41.033 --> 26:42.935
I'm a friend of your son.

26:42.969 --> 26:44.270
Jackson is in trouble,

26:44.303 --> 26:46.906
and I think that he might
be trying to find you.

26:46.939 --> 26:49.709
Please.
He really needs your help.

26:49.742 --> 26:53.045
(trilling)

26:53.079 --> 26:54.080
Hello?

26:54.113 --> 26:55.682
(disconnects)

26:55.715 --> 26:57.984
Did you get it?

26:59.218 --> 27:01.087
(chirping) Yes.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.222
An address just outside
of Washington, D.C.

27:03.255 --> 27:05.257
(sighs)

27:08.027 --> 27:11.230
(engine revving)

27:11.263 --> 27:13.299
(bird singing, phone ringing)

27:14.400 --> 27:16.869
Okay. Go right. Go right.

27:16.903 --> 27:19.739
(tires squealing, horn honking)

27:19.772 --> 27:24.176
(tires squealing,
engine revving)

27:24.210 --> 27:25.320
Are we sure this is working?

27:25.344 --> 27:26.913
Birds have a much more

27:26.946 --> 27:28.380
acute sound
recognition than we do.

27:28.414 --> 27:30.683
They can hear a storm
coming a hundred miles away.

27:30.717 --> 27:32.719
Yes, but can he hear Jackson?

27:32.752 --> 27:35.187
Look. He's scared to death.
He's trying to fly left,

27:35.221 --> 27:36.422
so we'll go right.

27:36.455 --> 27:37.890
(engine revving, bird singing)

27:39.759 --> 27:42.028
(tires squeal)

27:45.998 --> 27:48.300
(bird calmly chirping)

27:50.336 --> 27:52.171
Damn bird's not saying much now.

27:52.204 --> 27:54.173
Come on, bird.

27:54.206 --> 27:55.775
Do something. Get scared.

27:55.808 --> 27:58.177
(frantic chirping)

27:58.210 --> 27:59.278
Go left! Go left! Oh. Okay.

27:59.311 --> 28:03.182
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

28:05.017 --> 28:06.118
(frantic chirping)

28:06.152 --> 28:08.130
No, no, no, no! Right, right, right!
Go right. Go right.

28:08.154 --> 28:10.222
(tires squealing) No!
No! No! No!

28:10.256 --> 28:12.491
Left! Left! Left! Left!
Damn bird is all over the place!

28:12.524 --> 28:14.326
Left! Left! Left!

28:14.360 --> 28:16.829
Tell the bird to make up its mind!
Come on, bird!

28:16.863 --> 28:18.330
Okay, go, go. Left, left.

28:18.364 --> 28:19.331
Left! Left! Left!

28:19.365 --> 28:21.500
(tires squealing)

28:21.533 --> 28:24.170
He's going nuts. We got to be close.
(engine revving)

28:24.203 --> 28:27.907
(loud chirping)

28:27.940 --> 28:30.977
Look where we are.

28:31.010 --> 28:32.979
(airplane engine roars)

28:33.012 --> 28:34.981
He came back.

28:35.014 --> 28:37.750
(bird sings calmly)

28:44.991 --> 28:46.258
Hey.

28:47.293 --> 28:49.228
What's going on?

28:49.261 --> 28:51.330
You guys, there's someone
here you should meet.

28:57.336 --> 28:58.971
This is Vera Salvon.

28:59.005 --> 29:00.306
VERA: I'm glad

29:00.339 --> 29:01.841
you're all here.

29:01.874 --> 29:05.077
I have a message
from Jackson Oz.

29:18.057 --> 29:21.193
Anybody else would've thought
your friend was crazy,

29:21.227 --> 29:22.895
but I knew something
wasn't right.

29:24.563 --> 29:27.099
After the parakeet bit me,

29:27.133 --> 29:29.535
strange things began to happen.

29:29.568 --> 29:32.805
Do you mind if I take a look at your
arm, Ms. Salvon? Yeah.

29:37.043 --> 29:40.212
So you've been experiencing
black tears? Mucus?

29:40.246 --> 29:42.982
Yes. Jackson explained to me

29:43.015 --> 29:44.450
that it was happening to
him, too.

29:44.483 --> 29:48.020
He said that we
both had this thing.

29:48.054 --> 29:50.389
A ghost gene.

29:50.422 --> 29:54.360
It's what gave us
the animal mutation.

29:54.393 --> 29:57.930
But he said there
was a way to cure...

29:57.964 --> 30:00.867
not just me...

30:00.900 --> 30:02.134
But the whole world.

30:02.168 --> 30:05.304
He wants you to replace
him, be an incubator.

30:05.337 --> 30:06.873
Is that possible?

30:06.906 --> 30:08.908
In theory. Yeah. I...

30:08.941 --> 30:09.976
I don't know.

30:10.009 --> 30:12.011
I got to run some tests.

30:14.246 --> 30:17.016
This means he's not
planning on coming back.

30:20.219 --> 30:22.188
I'm sorry.

30:22.221 --> 30:25.024
No. Thanks to you,

30:25.057 --> 30:28.194
we finally know what
Jackson has been up to.

30:31.197 --> 30:32.564
And thanks to you,

30:32.598 --> 30:34.600
we know where to find him.

30:46.612 --> 30:49.148
(bird sings)

30:49.181 --> 30:54.153
This will tell us if
you can use me to do...

30:54.186 --> 30:55.087
whatever you call it?

30:55.121 --> 30:56.655
Incubate the cure. Yes.

30:56.688 --> 31:00.026
But first I need to make
sure your body can handle it

31:00.059 --> 31:01.336
without rejecting
the genomic fossils

31:01.360 --> 31:04.496
I need to introduce into your
DNA, okay?

31:04.530 --> 31:08.034
Shouldn't take long.

31:14.406 --> 31:15.474
He's a charmer.

31:15.507 --> 31:17.676
(chuckles)

31:17.709 --> 31:19.211
Mrs. Salvon?

31:19.245 --> 31:21.981
Why did you keep your parakeet

31:22.014 --> 31:23.115
after the animals changed?

31:23.149 --> 31:25.151
He belonged to my late husband.

31:25.184 --> 31:27.453
The bird hated everyone.

31:27.486 --> 31:30.056
When Gunter passed,
I couldn't bring myself

31:30.089 --> 31:31.690
to put it in quarantine.

31:31.723 --> 31:36.228
I guess we should all be
glad that you kept him.

31:36.262 --> 31:39.131
And thank you for doing this.

31:39.165 --> 31:42.134
Not everyone would be so...
calm.

31:44.403 --> 31:45.371
I watched my husband die,

31:45.404 --> 31:47.573
and I've been through
two bouts with cancer.

31:47.606 --> 31:49.475
I'm not about to let a
nip from a little bird

31:49.508 --> 31:51.010
get the best of me.

31:51.043 --> 31:53.445
(chuckles) Well,
you're braver than most people.

31:53.479 --> 31:55.181
So tell me,

31:55.214 --> 31:56.415
what's a young woman like you

31:56.448 --> 31:59.185
getting messed up
in all of this?

31:59.218 --> 32:01.120
The world is ending.

32:01.153 --> 32:03.422
You should be at home.

32:03.455 --> 32:05.157
With loved ones.

32:07.193 --> 32:10.196
Well, I'm here trying to
prevent the world from ending.

32:10.229 --> 32:12.731
And I...

32:12.764 --> 32:14.733
I don't really have any family.

32:14.766 --> 32:17.103
Nonsense.

32:17.136 --> 32:21.073
In order to survive,
sometimes you have to...

32:21.107 --> 32:22.241
build walls.

32:22.274 --> 32:24.510
Both literally and figuratively.

32:24.543 --> 32:28.047
And I guess some of
those walls are...

32:28.080 --> 32:29.724
easier to build than
they are to take down.

32:29.748 --> 32:31.217
Perhaps.

32:31.250 --> 32:33.285
But I think I'd
prefer to be in danger

32:33.319 --> 32:35.154
with those that I love,

32:35.187 --> 32:36.755
than safe.

32:36.788 --> 32:38.524
And alone.

32:38.557 --> 32:40.392
MITCH: All right,
test looks good.

32:40.426 --> 32:42.028
Oh.

32:42.061 --> 32:44.630
Soon as we find
that saber-tooth,

32:44.663 --> 32:46.298
Vera here should
make a perfect host.

32:46.332 --> 32:47.332
(chuckles)

32:48.134 --> 32:49.768
Oh, there you are.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.970
Everything is going to work out.

32:54.240 --> 32:56.208
I like this one.

32:56.242 --> 32:58.244
When everything is over,

32:58.277 --> 33:00.712
you and him can
work on that wall.

33:01.580 --> 33:03.482
What is she talking about?

33:03.515 --> 33:05.617
Ignore her.

33:05.651 --> 33:08.587
(Vera chuckles)

33:35.781 --> 33:37.616
"Animal aggression...

33:37.649 --> 33:40.286
"increased hCG levels...

33:40.319 --> 33:42.221
94% accuracy..."

33:42.254 --> 33:45.291
Those horses in England
weren't ignoring everyone else.

33:45.324 --> 33:46.392
They were targeting you.

33:47.526 --> 33:49.095
Because you're pregnant.

33:49.128 --> 33:51.197
So what, you want to
throw me a baby shower?

33:51.230 --> 33:52.664
That's why you stayed back?

33:52.698 --> 33:56.835
I won't be a liability.

33:56.868 --> 33:58.737
You gonna tell everybody?
That is

33:58.770 --> 34:00.406
what I was going to ask you.

34:02.274 --> 34:03.274
What about Abe?

34:08.880 --> 34:11.550
I need to figure some
things out first.

34:11.583 --> 34:13.585
I'm assuming you don't
want kids right now?

34:13.619 --> 34:15.254
I didn't think I did.

34:15.286 --> 34:17.089
Pregnancy is rough,

34:17.123 --> 34:18.657
even in the best conditions.

34:18.690 --> 34:21.226
And you're gonna spend
the next nine months

34:21.260 --> 34:22.304
with a target on your back?

34:22.328 --> 34:24.330
Then I guess that gives
me a damn good incentive

34:24.362 --> 34:25.664
to fight for the future.

34:26.898 --> 34:30.202
Everything happens for a
reason, right?

34:56.395 --> 34:59.365
This place where
they've got Robert Oz.

34:59.398 --> 35:00.866
It's not government property.

35:02.401 --> 35:04.136
So whatever he and
Davies are up to,

35:04.170 --> 35:05.103
it is very off-book.

35:05.137 --> 35:08.240
We'll know soon enough.
I've got great news.

35:08.274 --> 35:10.309
Ivankov is meeting with
his cabinet of ministers

35:10.342 --> 35:12.878
tomorrow to vote.
He's already convinced two,

35:12.911 --> 35:14.546
and he's working on the rest.

35:15.414 --> 35:18.217
(scoffs)

35:18.250 --> 35:19.251
Ah...

35:20.452 --> 35:22.188
Do you think he has
time to convince them?

35:22.221 --> 35:24.323
He's optimistic. Good job.

35:24.356 --> 35:27.793
Well... I just told the truth.

35:27.826 --> 35:31.330
And I owe you the truth.

35:32.931 --> 35:34.433
I'm in love with Mitch.

35:35.934 --> 35:39.638
I wasn't lying before before.
Except maybe to myself.

35:41.307 --> 35:43.375
Losing him has been

35:43.409 --> 35:45.711
one of the biggest
regrets of my life.

35:45.744 --> 35:49.315
And just getting thrown together
with him during all of this?

35:51.383 --> 35:53.452
Maybe it happened for a reason?

35:55.821 --> 35:58.490
Thank you.

36:00.792 --> 36:03.795
(clears throat)

36:21.947 --> 36:23.782
(softly): Hi.

36:24.250 --> 36:24.850
Abraham.

36:24.883 --> 36:25.884
Yes, ma'am.

36:28.954 --> 36:30.456
Jackson wanted me

36:30.489 --> 36:32.858
to give this to you in private.

36:32.891 --> 36:35.594
Mrs. Salvon.

36:35.627 --> 36:36.762
Thank you.

36:45.804 --> 36:47.306
JACKSON: Abe.

36:47.339 --> 36:51.277
We've both done things
we cannot change...

36:51.310 --> 36:53.979
things we regret.

36:54.012 --> 36:57.316
By now, you must realize
what I'm gonna do,

36:57.349 --> 37:00.352
and that I'm not coming back.

37:00.386 --> 37:02.488
So there's something that
I need to say to you.

37:04.290 --> 37:07.493
For a long time,
you've called me Rafiki,

37:07.526 --> 37:09.261
a name that means friend.

37:09.295 --> 37:12.331
But given everything we've been
through, we're not friends.

37:12.364 --> 37:13.599
We're much more.

37:13.632 --> 37:15.434
We're brothers

37:15.467 --> 37:17.336
and always have been.

37:17.369 --> 37:19.338
So no matter what happens,

37:19.371 --> 37:20.839
know this:

37:20.872 --> 37:22.808
I forgive you.

37:22.841 --> 37:25.311
(shuddering breath)

37:33.919 --> 37:35.587
(phone dialing)

37:35.621 --> 37:36.488
Sir?

37:36.522 --> 37:38.065
The Russians are
holding a vote tomorrow

37:38.089 --> 37:39.124
about the Noah Objective.

37:39.157 --> 37:41.560
Some of the ministers are
considering pulling out.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.429
Somebody's whispering
in Ivankov's ear.

37:43.462 --> 37:44.430
OFFICER: General Davies?

37:44.463 --> 37:45.497
You have a call.

37:45.531 --> 37:46.732
Not now.

37:46.765 --> 37:47.833
It's Jackson Oz.

37:52.103 --> 37:53.305
Jackson?

37:53.339 --> 37:54.473
Hey, Davies.

37:54.506 --> 37:56.608
We need to talk.

38:06.084 --> 38:07.619
So, the prodigal son returns.

38:07.653 --> 38:09.555
I want to speak to my father.

38:09.588 --> 38:10.756
Run a trace.

38:14.860 --> 38:17.729
(computer trilling)

38:17.763 --> 38:19.665
What makes you
think I can do that?

38:19.698 --> 38:21.633
Jerk me around
again, and I hang up.

38:21.667 --> 38:22.801
Okay, okay.

38:22.834 --> 38:23.702
I can help you.

38:23.735 --> 38:24.736
Tell me the real reason

38:24.770 --> 38:26.037
you came after me in Portugal.

38:26.071 --> 38:27.105
Now.

38:27.138 --> 38:28.674
Your father has
something I need.

38:28.707 --> 38:31.743
And he won't give it to
me unless he sees you.

38:35.881 --> 38:37.816
I'm willing to turn myself in,

38:37.849 --> 38:39.818
but I need proof
that you've got him.

38:39.851 --> 38:40.986
I can do that. I can do that.

38:41.019 --> 38:42.621
Hold on...

38:42.654 --> 38:45.357
Call the house.
Get Robert Oz on the line,

38:45.391 --> 38:46.792
right now! Sir.

38:46.825 --> 38:49.495
(phone beeps, dials)

38:49.528 --> 38:51.797
(phone ringing)

38:55.100 --> 38:58.370
(ringing continues)

39:00.071 --> 39:01.071
Jackson!

39:03.709 --> 39:04.976
Dr. Oz?

39:07.546 --> 39:09.715
(ringing continues)

39:11.517 --> 39:13.118
(line ringing)

39:15.687 --> 39:16.955
(ringing continues)

39:25.631 --> 39:28.767
(ringing continues)

39:29.635 --> 39:32.037
(line ringing)

39:42.180 --> 39:44.583
(ringing continues)

39:58.897 --> 40:00.799
ABRAHAM: Robert...

40:00.832 --> 40:02.901
Robert Oz...

40:02.934 --> 40:04.903
No answer from the safe house.

40:04.936 --> 40:07.573
Dammit, we never should've let
him out of that cell. Jackson.

40:07.606 --> 40:09.875
Davies,
I know you're tracing this call.

40:10.942 --> 40:11.942
ABRAHAM: Robert Oz?

40:28.960 --> 40:30.562
You don't think that...?

40:32.964 --> 40:35.801
No, Jackson could
never have done this.

40:35.834 --> 40:37.469
(tires screeching outside)

40:37.503 --> 40:38.670
(car doors opening)

40:38.704 --> 40:40.706
Company.

40:42.574 --> 40:44.843
You have 15 seconds to
put my father on the line,

40:44.876 --> 40:45.877
or I disappear.

40:45.911 --> 40:46.712
Take it easy.

40:46.745 --> 40:48.580
We have your father
in a safe house.

40:48.614 --> 40:49.515
We can't reach him right now,

40:49.548 --> 40:50.649
but I can take you to him.

40:51.983 --> 40:53.685
OFFICER: He's right
outside the building!

40:53.719 --> 40:55.053
Scramble CRT.

40:55.086 --> 40:56.788
Get snipers in position.

41:05.831 --> 41:07.599
I'm hanging up.

41:07.633 --> 41:08.710
No, no, no, wait!
I can prove it.

41:08.734 --> 41:09.974
Good-bye. The three-pronged scar

41:10.001 --> 41:10.969
on the back of your neck.

41:11.002 --> 41:12.871
That's from an injection
your father gave you.

41:21.747 --> 41:23.181
All right, I'm coming in.

41:23.214 --> 41:25.517
Tell your men I'm unarmed.

41:25.551 --> 41:26.885
I just want to see my father.

41:26.918 --> 41:28.086
Of course. Of course.

41:34.726 --> 41:35.761
We got him!

41:35.794 --> 41:38.664
Sir, the field team just
called from the safe house.

41:38.697 --> 41:39.931
Robert Oz is gone.

41:39.965 --> 41:41.266
Son of a bitch!

41:47.105 --> 41:48.807
Jackson Oz is approaching.

41:48.840 --> 41:50.576
CRT is ready to
sedate the target.

41:50.609 --> 41:51.242
New plan.

41:51.276 --> 41:52.277
Sir?

41:52.310 --> 41:53.879
Kill him.

41:53.912 --> 41:55.614
The second his hand
touches the door.

41:58.316 --> 42:00.686
We may need him
to find Robert Oz.

42:00.719 --> 42:02.788
If we kill his son,
Robert Oz will find us.

42:02.821 --> 42:04.656
You take the shot.

42:04.690 --> 42:06.825
I want Jackson Oz dead.

42:08.794 --> 42:11.229
All right, new orders.
Follow CRT.

42:11.262 --> 42:12.530
Take the shot.

42:24.342 --> 42:26.678
â™ª

42:53.672 --> 42:54.773
We should run.
