WEBVTT

00:04.634 --> 00:06.737
Hey.

00:06.806 --> 00:08.642
We've got company.

00:08.709 --> 00:09.710
So we do.

00:09.778 --> 00:11.881
Mm.

00:11.951 --> 00:13.185
Yeah, he sees us, too.

00:13.253 --> 00:14.555
Yeah, sure, he does.

00:14.622 --> 00:16.023
You'd better do something.

00:16.091 --> 00:17.560
Mm-hmm.

00:17.627 --> 00:19.130
All right. 50 yards.

00:19.198 --> 00:20.333
Uh-huh.

00:20.400 --> 00:21.502
40.

00:22.672 --> 00:23.873
35!

00:23.941 --> 00:25.711
- Yep.
- Shoot! Shoot!

00:25.779 --> 00:27.247
Shoot! Shoot, man!

00:27.315 --> 00:28.284
Shoot!

00:31.758 --> 00:33.326
Ooh!

00:35.966 --> 00:37.035
Mike?

00:37.103 --> 00:39.172
Honey, have you seen my brown shoes?

00:39.240 --> 00:40.742
Oh! Wait a minute.
Here they are.

00:40.810 --> 00:43.648
<i>Mom! Mandy blew a fuse
with her hair dryer again!</i>

00:43.717 --> 00:45.085
- Ooh.
- I did not! It was Eve!

00:45.153 --> 00:46.722
- I don't even dry my hair!
- Ooh.

00:46.789 --> 00:50.462
What kind of person even admits that?

00:50.583 --> 00:52.509
Last Man Standing - S01E17

Original air date

00:54.407 --> 00:57.058
Sync and corrections by Gatto
for www.addic7ed.com

00:57.178 --> 00:59.582
Now I was gonna try clear gloss
over flat matte.

00:59.650 --> 01:01.053
- Mm-hmm.
- Never dries right.

01:01.120 --> 01:03.123
Okay, what you wanna do
is use a water-based polish

01:03.191 --> 01:05.093
and that way, you don't need
a cover gloss. Right, dad?

01:05.161 --> 01:07.665
I'm really trying hard
not to listen to this.

01:07.732 --> 01:10.237
Maybe I need to, you know,
shake things up.

01:10.305 --> 01:11.640
Try something exciting.

01:11.708 --> 01:13.879
Something exciting.
I like the sound of that.

01:13.947 --> 01:14.981
I'm way ahead of you.

01:15.049 --> 01:18.155
Ten nails--
ten different colors!

01:18.223 --> 01:21.595
Oh, man, honey, we gotta get outta here.

01:21.662 --> 01:24.134
Let's do something exciting
this weekend. Go winter camping.

01:24.202 --> 01:26.205
We'll get the snowmobiles out,
have a riot, huh?

01:26.272 --> 01:27.440
Nope, can't.

01:27.509 --> 01:29.479
I got my pickling class
with Michelle tonight.

01:29.546 --> 01:31.716
- Your pickling class?
- Yep, yep.

01:31.784 --> 01:35.325
That makes your knitting group
sound like an x game.

01:35.392 --> 01:37.895
Stop. I enjoy it.

01:37.963 --> 01:39.933
Plus, you gotta take Boyd to Gymborama,

01:40.001 --> 01:41.970
and you promised you'd take Eve
to get new socks.

01:42.038 --> 01:45.546
- Whoo! How could I forget a day like that?
- Yeah.

01:45.614 --> 01:46.681
Where is Eve?

01:46.749 --> 01:48.785
Oh, uh, she's studying for math club.

01:48.853 --> 01:50.422
- Before breakfast?
- Yeah, well...

01:50.490 --> 01:51.925
She's gotta dial it down a bit.

01:51.993 --> 01:54.029
How come she can't be
more like professor nail polish

01:54.096 --> 01:54.998
and aunt boring over there?

01:58.907 --> 02:01.612
Hey, so, uh, I'm wondering

02:01.680 --> 02:04.886
if next Saturday, you could
pick up Boyd from day care?

02:04.953 --> 02:06.021
Yeah. Sure. Why?

02:06.089 --> 02:07.792
Can't tell you.

02:07.860 --> 02:08.794
Is it personal?

02:08.860 --> 02:10.830
Can't tell you.

02:10.899 --> 02:11.800
Is it something about me?

02:11.867 --> 02:12.835
- Yes.
- Really?

02:12.903 --> 02:14.272
- No.
- Oh.

02:14.340 --> 02:15.875
Well, then I don't care.

02:15.943 --> 02:16.977
- Well, good.
- Well, good.

02:19.685 --> 02:21.221
I do care. I can't think.
I'm not eating.

02:21.288 --> 02:22.890
Kristin, tell me.
Tell me.

02:26.899 --> 02:29.671
Hey, Mike Baxter here for outdoor man.

02:29.739 --> 02:31.575
Thinking today about
the best part about hunting.

02:31.643 --> 02:33.279
Lot of good parts,
but the very best part--

02:33.347 --> 02:35.751
think about it--
when your gun jams.

02:35.818 --> 02:36.753
What? Gun jams?

02:36.820 --> 02:38.123
Yeah, think about it--

02:38.190 --> 02:40.728
now you have a 500-pound black bear,

02:40.795 --> 02:42.163
who's kind of mad at you,

02:42.232 --> 02:43.433
running right at you.

02:43.501 --> 02:44.903
And you're thinking to yourself,

02:44.971 --> 02:48.444
"Huh. I don't think I'm gonna
make it through this."

02:48.512 --> 02:50.382
In that split second, you're going,

02:50.449 --> 02:53.220
"I'm gonna spend eternity now
with Marilyn Monroe,

02:53.289 --> 02:54.257
"Jesus,

02:54.325 --> 02:56.161
and most of Lynyrd Skynyrd."

02:57.363 --> 02:59.166
But your fortune changes.

02:59.233 --> 03:00.670
Get a new cartridge back in that gun,

03:00.737 --> 03:03.141
you rack it, boom,
you pop off, hit the bear.

03:03.209 --> 03:05.781
Now he gets to spend eternity
with gentle Ben,

03:05.848 --> 03:07.551
bear Jesus,

03:07.619 --> 03:09.690
and most of the Country Bear Jamboree.

03:11.159 --> 03:12.661
There's nothing like
the rush of adrenaline

03:12.729 --> 03:14.398
to make you feel alive.

03:14.466 --> 03:15.702
Whether it's swimming with sharks,

03:15.769 --> 03:17.170
or if you're with your girlfriend,

03:17.238 --> 03:18.841
and all of a sudden, her husband
pulls in the driveway

03:18.908 --> 03:22.650
in his patrol car.

03:22.718 --> 03:25.789
You know, sadly, a lot of us
just don't feel this.

03:25.857 --> 03:30.799
"Men lead lives of quiet desperation."

03:30.867 --> 03:32.436
Thoreau.

03:32.504 --> 03:36.512
"Boredom is desire seeking desire."

03:36.580 --> 03:37.514
Tolstoy.

03:37.582 --> 03:38.416
Communist.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.389
"Bored?

03:41.457 --> 03:42.925
"Get out of the basement,

03:42.993 --> 03:46.399
<i>put the comic books down,
and do something!"</i>

03:46.466 --> 03:47.668
Grammy.

03:52.112 --> 03:54.316
Mike, I wanna show you something here.

03:54.384 --> 03:57.456
I've been thinking of jazzing up
the retail space a little bit,

03:57.524 --> 03:58.558
to add some excitement here, you know?

03:58.627 --> 03:59.861
All right!
Yeah?

03:59.929 --> 04:01.697
Yeah, let's do it. Exciting.
What do you wanna do?

04:01.765 --> 04:04.369
Well, I'm thinking of arranging
the fishing rods by height.

04:04.438 --> 04:05.873
Huh? See? See?

04:07.645 --> 04:09.448
Not exciting enough, huh?

04:09.515 --> 04:12.153
What do you say we blow something up?

04:12.220 --> 04:13.490
Yeah.

04:13.558 --> 04:14.993
Like what?

04:15.061 --> 04:16.195
Like a bass boat.

04:16.262 --> 04:18.332
We fill it with gasoline,

04:18.399 --> 04:19.635
we shoot it 50 feet in the air,

04:19.702 --> 04:21.172
the thing bursts into a fireball.

04:21.238 --> 04:23.076
We'll sell a lot of somethin'.

04:23.143 --> 04:28.287
Could I ask you to reconsider
the fishing rod idea?

04:29.525 --> 04:30.526
Wrestling!

04:30.594 --> 04:32.964
We put a cage over by camping.

04:33.031 --> 04:35.167
People come in, they watch
greasy men beat each other up,

04:35.235 --> 04:36.972
<i>they'll buy something.</i>

04:37.039 --> 04:38.108
Hmm.

04:38.175 --> 04:40.981
Or I could just send you to Brisbane.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.450
In Australia?

04:42.519 --> 04:45.156
Yeah, well, the hunting
and fishing expo's next month.

04:45.224 --> 04:47.394
- I know.
- And clearly, you're itching for some real excitement.

04:47.461 --> 04:50.065
Reward yourself with a trip.
Enjoy. Go on. Go on. Go on.

04:50.134 --> 04:52.705
Ah, I can't.

04:53.808 --> 04:55.578
With Vanessa's promotion,

04:55.646 --> 04:59.285
I've been pickling up the slack at home.

04:59.353 --> 05:02.492
Did you just say "pickling"?

05:02.561 --> 05:04.830
Did I?

05:04.898 --> 05:08.271
All right. All right.
Professional wrestlers it is.

05:08.338 --> 05:10.475
Okay, we'll put a couple
by the register.

05:10.543 --> 05:12.547
If you can defeat them,
you get 20% off your purchase.

05:12.615 --> 05:13.549
How's that?

05:13.617 --> 05:15.019
I don't think our customers

05:15.087 --> 05:16.990
should have to fight someone
to buy things.

05:17.058 --> 05:19.528
All right, just spitballing.
They're not all gems, right?

05:19.597 --> 05:21.298
How about my NASCAR idea?

05:21.365 --> 05:24.170
No offense, but I think
you're past the age limit.

05:24.238 --> 05:25.641
Besides, I drove in today,

05:25.709 --> 05:27.745
you were asleep in the car
with your blinker on.

05:27.813 --> 05:29.650
Aw, come on.
You know, I'm serious.

05:29.718 --> 05:31.285
NASCAR's one of the biggest
sports in America.

05:31.354 --> 05:34.627
75 million fans. It'll be
a huge promotion for us.

05:34.694 --> 05:36.196
Maybe not a bad idea.

05:36.264 --> 05:38.100
We get a car, put it in our store,

05:38.167 --> 05:39.837
people come in, fan appreciation day,

05:39.904 --> 05:41.273
we bring a lot of customers in.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.844
I've known Tony Stewart for years.

05:42.911 --> 05:44.046
I'll give him a call.

05:44.114 --> 05:45.916
Maybe we can get our logo on the car!

05:45.985 --> 05:48.221
All right! I love that,
I love that, I love that.

05:48.289 --> 05:50.861
I've been looking for somewhere
to invest all that cash

05:50.928 --> 05:52.998
that I've got taped under my desk.

05:53.066 --> 05:54.300
What?

05:54.368 --> 05:56.338
Nothin'.

05:57.575 --> 05:59.344
Tell me. Tell me.

05:59.412 --> 06:01.049
Tell me. Tell me.

06:01.116 --> 06:02.285
Tell me. Tell me.

06:02.352 --> 06:04.255
I listened to Boyd ask for a cookie

06:04.323 --> 06:06.126
for three straight hours yesterday.

06:06.194 --> 06:08.631
You really think you can break me?

06:08.699 --> 06:10.601
What if I tell you one of my secrets?

06:10.669 --> 06:13.842
You don't have any secrets.
You never shut up.

06:13.910 --> 06:15.813
Not true. I shut up just long enough

06:15.880 --> 06:17.884
to hear a very juicy secret
about Jake Borelli

06:17.952 --> 06:21.558
and who he was making out with
in his grandma's motor home.

06:24.032 --> 06:25.834
Okay.

06:25.901 --> 06:26.802
Who?

06:26.870 --> 06:27.871
You first.

06:30.544 --> 06:33.283
Okay, fine. But you cannot tell
Eve, because she'll tell mom.

06:33.351 --> 06:34.285
She's a rat.

06:34.353 --> 06:35.454
I know. She's on her payroll.

06:35.521 --> 06:38.193
That's why her allowance is so big.

06:38.261 --> 06:39.630
- Come on.
- Okay, okay.

06:39.697 --> 06:41.734
Okay, so a bunch of the girls
at work are going skydiving,

06:41.802 --> 06:43.237
and I signed up, too.

06:43.304 --> 06:44.439
You did what?

06:45.843 --> 06:47.479
Get in here.

06:50.153 --> 06:51.755
You cannot tell mom.

06:51.823 --> 06:53.392
She's the matriarch of the family.

06:53.459 --> 06:54.527
She's supposed to know everything.

06:54.595 --> 06:56.532
Here. Look.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.904
That's me tap dancing in a tankini.

06:58.971 --> 07:00.740
Right. It is one click away
from going viral.

07:00.809 --> 07:01.976
- No, no! Stop!
- Watch me.

07:03.580 --> 07:05.417
Fine.

07:05.484 --> 07:06.619
I won't tell mom.

07:06.688 --> 07:08.156
Tell me what?

07:08.224 --> 07:09.759
Uh, nothing.

07:09.828 --> 07:11.932
What's with the third degree?
Where am I, GITMO?

07:17.276 --> 07:18.344
Hey.

07:18.411 --> 07:19.780
Hey!

07:19.849 --> 07:22.553
So I pulled out some steaks
for you and the girls.

07:22.620 --> 07:24.157
- Why? Where are you going?
- Pickling.

07:24.225 --> 07:25.292
- Pickling?
- Yeah.

07:25.360 --> 07:26.495
Listen to yourself.

07:26.563 --> 07:28.099
You used to ski down black diamond hills

07:28.167 --> 07:29.335
on one leg.

07:29.402 --> 07:31.405
Now you're putting vegetables in brine.

07:31.473 --> 07:33.510
And?

07:33.578 --> 07:35.915
Aren't you the woman that got
kicked out of a national park

07:35.983 --> 07:39.656
<i>for kayaking down
a waterfall buck naked?</i>

07:39.724 --> 07:41.126
I know what this is.
I know.

07:41.194 --> 07:42.864
You're upset about something,

07:42.931 --> 07:45.402
and you are not gonna be happy
until I am upset, too.

07:45.469 --> 07:48.207
But it's not gonna work,
because I am very happy.

07:48.275 --> 07:49.577
- Pickling?
- Yeah, pickling. I enjoy it.

07:49.645 --> 07:51.448
- Just like an old woman.
- No, that's not gonna work.

07:51.516 --> 07:53.285
Yeah? Where you taking your classes?

07:53.352 --> 07:54.988
The senior center.

07:57.429 --> 07:59.900
Congratulations!
I am now upset!

08:07.278 --> 08:10.149
Okay, guys, we're all set.
Tony Stewart's car is here.

08:10.270 --> 08:11.738
How'd you get it in so fast?

08:11.806 --> 08:13.142
Curly and the guys.

08:13.210 --> 08:14.946
They help me push it in
through the elephant doors.

08:15.013 --> 08:17.451
- Yeah, well, where's Tony?
- He said he had to pee like a race car.

08:17.518 --> 08:20.357
Then he started laughing.

08:20.424 --> 08:21.693
Let's see it!

08:21.761 --> 08:23.998
Come on. I can't wait to see the logo!

08:24.066 --> 08:25.533
Come on.

08:26.571 --> 08:29.041
Wow. (Laughs) Look at that.

08:29.110 --> 08:30.946
Ooh.

08:31.014 --> 08:32.349
Where's the logo?

08:32.416 --> 08:33.618
Kyle, show him.

08:33.686 --> 08:34.988
- It's over here.
- Huh?

08:37.193 --> 08:39.398
It's right... there.

08:39.465 --> 08:43.337
There it is! There it is!
Outdoor man.

08:43.405 --> 08:45.075
Somehow, I thought it might be bigger.

08:46.546 --> 08:47.847
Looks pretty good.

08:47.916 --> 08:51.022
I can cover it with my thumb.

08:51.089 --> 08:54.296
And the Basque are not
known for large thumbs.

08:56.901 --> 08:59.472
Well, how you doing, Smoke?

08:59.540 --> 09:00.774
How you doing, Choke?

09:00.843 --> 09:02.445
Good to see you.

09:02.512 --> 09:03.648
"Choke"?

09:03.715 --> 09:05.685
What, did you get
all nervous and freeze up?

09:05.753 --> 09:07.156
No, I actually choked someone

09:07.223 --> 09:09.226
'cause they asked me a stupid question.

09:13.837 --> 09:15.739
Uh, Tony Stewart, this is
our C.E.O., Ed Alzate.

09:15.807 --> 09:17.377
A pleasure.
Question, Tony, please.

09:17.445 --> 09:18.679
Come on.

09:18.746 --> 09:23.055
Um, any way to make
this logo a little bigger?

09:23.123 --> 09:24.860
Well, it's not really my area.

09:24.927 --> 09:27.264
I see, but the--
the car's your area, right?

09:27.332 --> 09:29.435
- Right.
- And the logo is on the car?

09:29.503 --> 09:32.508
Uh, how--how could
that not be your area?

09:32.575 --> 09:36.183
Ed, Ed... dial it back
a little bit, all right?

09:36.251 --> 09:38.788
Forget it. He's all hopped up
on jelly beans.

09:38.856 --> 09:41.628
Listen, I'm doing you
a huge favor here, Choke.

09:41.695 --> 09:44.133
This isn't a show car.
This is the real deal.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.037
Won the sprint cup title in this baby.

09:46.104 --> 09:47.273
I really appreciate it.

09:47.341 --> 09:48.608
You know, and it's lucky for you

09:48.676 --> 09:50.212
I was busy that day,
'cause I think I probably

09:50.280 --> 09:52.384
could have taken you in my pickup truck.

09:52.452 --> 09:53.753
I can drive in reverse

09:53.820 --> 09:55.824
faster than you can drive
that old milk truck.

09:55.892 --> 09:57.929
That old milk truck
is a classic, you know?

09:57.996 --> 10:00.333
Much like your haircut.

10:01.971 --> 10:04.275
Listen, just don't let anybody touch it

10:04.342 --> 10:06.913
and lean on it and sit in it.

10:06.982 --> 10:10.154
And especially, most of all,
don't let anybody kiss the hood.

10:10.222 --> 10:11.458
Kiss the hood?

10:11.525 --> 10:12.626
Especially you.

10:14.932 --> 10:16.468
Anyway, what time you need me back here?

10:16.535 --> 10:17.903
Uh, show's at 4:00.

10:17.971 --> 10:19.240
Why don't you get back here
at 3:30 for some prep?

10:19.308 --> 10:20.275
We got a big crowd showing up.

10:20.343 --> 10:21.177
Sounds good.
I'll see you then.

10:21.245 --> 10:22.313
See you later, bud.

10:22.381 --> 10:25.153
Oh, this is some machine.

10:25.221 --> 10:26.622
Yeah, yeah. If I were younger,

10:26.690 --> 10:28.560
I'd be out in the parking lot
doing doughnuts in it.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.831
Even if you wanted to, this thing won't turn on.

10:30.898 --> 10:33.870
Oh, butch up, Mildred.

10:33.938 --> 10:36.074
All you'd have to do
is attach the battery,

10:36.144 --> 10:38.514
and then you just...
Flip the old kill switch.

10:38.581 --> 10:40.818
There you go, huh?

10:40.886 --> 10:44.026
Boy, driving this thing is like
being strapped to a missile.

10:44.093 --> 10:46.831
Yeah. A 900-horsepower missile.

10:46.899 --> 10:48.668
Can you imagine that?

10:48.735 --> 10:50.639
With 42 other cars right behind you?

10:50.706 --> 10:54.214
Going around Talladega?
Over 200 miles an hour? Yeah!

10:54.282 --> 10:55.749
Wow, huh?

10:55.817 --> 10:57.420
Yeah.

10:57.488 --> 11:00.025
I don't really get it.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.862
What don't you get?

11:01.931 --> 11:03.967
Oh, no, I think the car's pretty cool.

11:04.035 --> 11:05.804
I just don't get
the whole appeal of racing.

11:05.871 --> 11:08.176
It's about endurance, man and machine.

11:08.244 --> 11:10.515
Come on. These guys
are flying around the track,

11:10.583 --> 11:12.385
sometimes they're hitting 3 G's.

11:12.453 --> 11:14.656
3 G's! That's the same amount of G's

11:14.724 --> 11:18.732
as astronauts feel when
they take off on a rocket.

11:18.799 --> 11:20.969
Wow.

11:21.037 --> 11:22.773
Just wish our name was bigger.

11:28.286 --> 11:31.191
I'm thinking about pickling a radish.

11:31.260 --> 11:32.828
Is that crazy?
Tell me it's crazy.

11:34.031 --> 11:35.901
Hmm? What?

11:35.969 --> 11:38.473
I, uh...
Oh, no. No, no. No.

11:38.540 --> 11:39.776
You're distracted.

11:39.843 --> 11:41.846
A little.

11:41.914 --> 11:43.350
I mean--
just I...

11:43.418 --> 11:45.220
I was once a black diamond skier.

11:45.289 --> 11:47.024
I kayaked over a waterfall,

11:47.092 --> 11:49.863
I even repelled down the face
of Lincoln on mount Rushmore.

11:49.931 --> 11:52.502
And now I-I-I go to work,

11:52.570 --> 11:55.275
I raise kids, I-I pickle.

11:55.343 --> 11:57.714
I pickle things I don't even like.

11:57.782 --> 11:58.982
- You know what you need?
- What?

11:59.050 --> 12:01.922
Bangs.

12:01.990 --> 12:04.862
I really think your forehead
could pull it off.

12:04.930 --> 12:05.931
Everybody down!

12:05.998 --> 12:08.336
You! Down!

12:08.403 --> 12:10.406
Vanessa! He said to get down!

12:10.474 --> 12:12.109
He was very specific!

12:12.177 --> 12:13.279
Down!

12:16.019 --> 12:18.189
Lady, do you have a problem?

12:18.257 --> 12:20.929
Yeah. You're my problem.

12:20.997 --> 12:22.065
Ooh!

12:22.132 --> 12:23.000
Uhh!

12:28.479 --> 12:29.647
Drop it.

12:31.000 --> 12:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:39.335 --> 12:41.070
Too slow.

12:42.542 --> 12:44.645
<i>Mom. Mom!</i>

12:44.713 --> 12:47.652
Too slow.

12:47.720 --> 12:48.854
Mom!

12:48.922 --> 12:50.658
Hmm? What?

12:50.726 --> 12:51.828
Your friend is on the phone.

12:51.896 --> 12:52.797
What?

12:52.864 --> 12:54.032
You know, Michelle,

12:54.099 --> 12:58.574
the one that dad says
looks like a robot.

12:58.643 --> 13:00.879
Yeah, hi.
Hi, Michelle.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.650
What? Oh, yeah.
I-I'll meet you there.

13:02.717 --> 13:05.021
Oh, my gosh. Wow.

13:05.089 --> 13:06.190
- Mm.
- Mom.

13:06.258 --> 13:07.694
Hmm? What?

13:07.762 --> 13:08.930
Nothing.

13:08.998 --> 13:09.933
Wh-what?
What is it, honey?

13:10.000 --> 13:11.937
I can't tell you.

13:12.004 --> 13:14.274
I'm afraid I'll crack
if you keep asking me...

13:14.342 --> 13:17.113
If-- if you keep asking me.

13:17.181 --> 13:18.450
Well, is-- is it about school?

13:18.518 --> 13:19.819
No.
Mandy?

13:19.887 --> 13:20.855
No.
Kristin?

13:25.766 --> 13:27.168
What is it about Kristin?

13:27.236 --> 13:29.305
Look, I-I can't tell you.

13:29.373 --> 13:31.377
I'd sooner jump out of an airplane

13:31.444 --> 13:33.849
<i>with a bunch of waitresses
before I told you.</i>

13:33.917 --> 13:35.820
Is Kristin skydiving?

13:35.888 --> 13:38.258
I can't tell you.

13:38.326 --> 13:40.129
Good girl.

13:43.303 --> 13:44.638
He said not to do this.

13:44.705 --> 13:46.207
I don't care.
I want to kiss the hood.

13:46.275 --> 13:48.045
He put the thought in my head.

14:06.916 --> 14:09.020
"Dear sirs, by now you've
probably noticed that

14:09.088 --> 14:10.790
"the race car is missing.
That's because I took it.

14:10.858 --> 14:13.261
Warmest regards, Kyle."

14:13.329 --> 14:14.898
If Tony comes back, that car isn't here,

14:14.965 --> 14:15.967
we'll lose the endorsement.

14:16.036 --> 14:17.003
Yeah.

14:21.447 --> 14:22.916
Kyle speaking.

14:22.983 --> 14:24.285
Kyle, where are you?

14:24.353 --> 14:25.655
Oh, I wanted to try some of
those doughnut things

14:25.722 --> 14:27.225
you were talking about.

14:27.293 --> 14:28.626
But I can't get it in gear.
I think it's stuck.

14:28.694 --> 14:29.829
<i>Where are you?</i>

14:29.897 --> 14:30.798
North parking lot.

14:30.866 --> 14:32.101
Stay there. I'm coming.

14:32.169 --> 14:33.504
Okay, you can't miss me.

14:33.572 --> 14:36.043
I'm standing right next
to a bright red race car.

14:36.111 --> 14:37.746
Hello?

14:43.794 --> 14:44.727
Oh, my God.

14:44.795 --> 14:48.435
My heart is pounding so hard.

14:48.503 --> 14:49.972
Alpha team!
You're up next.

14:50.039 --> 14:51.576
Let's make our way to the staging area.

14:51.643 --> 14:52.511
Hustle up! Let's go!

14:55.685 --> 14:57.455
Kristin! Honey!

14:57.523 --> 14:59.159
Mom?

14:59.227 --> 15:00.327
Ugh! Eve!

15:00.394 --> 15:02.030
Yeah, yeah, Eve told me!

15:02.098 --> 15:03.467
And you should have, too!

15:03.535 --> 15:05.371
I know, but...

15:05.439 --> 15:07.208
Mom, it's not fair!

15:07.276 --> 15:10.482
Everybody else gets to have
all of this fun and excitement,

15:10.550 --> 15:12.720
and I don't.

15:12.788 --> 15:14.625
Honey, listen, I know.
I know it's not fair.

15:14.692 --> 15:16.327
And trust me, when I had you,

15:16.395 --> 15:17.830
I gave up a lot of stuff, too,

15:17.898 --> 15:19.934
like-- like smoking and bar fights

15:20.002 --> 15:21.338
and fatty food.

15:21.406 --> 15:23.743
I-- whoa. I'm-- did you say "bar fights"?

15:23.811 --> 15:25.445
Look-- it-- look,

15:25.514 --> 15:27.985
the-- the point is...
Is you are an adult.

15:28.054 --> 15:29.923
And you're a role model.

15:29.991 --> 15:32.696
And-- and you have to think
of more than just yourself.

15:32.763 --> 15:33.731
- I know that, and I do.
- Yeah.

15:33.799 --> 15:35.668
But it's just...
Being responsible

15:35.736 --> 15:37.907
doesn't mean never having any fun.

15:37.974 --> 15:40.477
Honey, that's exactly what it means.

15:40.545 --> 15:43.618
I don't really think
that you believe that.

15:43.686 --> 15:46.023
Well...

15:46.092 --> 15:48.996
I do. I do. Yes.
That is what I believe.

15:49.064 --> 15:50.466
Do it with me.

15:50.534 --> 15:51.568
<i>What?</i>

15:51.636 --> 15:53.172
Yeah. Come on.
You should jump with me.

15:53.240 --> 15:54.541
- Come on, mom, it's gonna be awesome.
- I know,

15:54.609 --> 15:56.344
but that would make me
a total hypocrite!

15:56.412 --> 15:59.051
So? Would you rather be
a big old bore? Come on!

15:59.119 --> 16:00.553
- Come on.
- Ladies! Last chance!

16:00.621 --> 16:01.823
Who's jumping?

16:01.891 --> 16:03.526
Yeah. You heard him.
Last chance, ladies.

16:03.594 --> 16:04.595
Who's jumping? Come on.

16:04.663 --> 16:06.466
No, you go. You go.

16:06.533 --> 16:07.669
Go. Have fun.

16:07.737 --> 16:08.638
You sure?

16:08.705 --> 16:10.175
Go.

16:10.243 --> 16:12.011
Okay.

16:25.909 --> 16:27.511
Hey! Smoke! You're early!

16:27.578 --> 16:28.913
Yeah, it's just kind of my thing.

16:28.980 --> 16:30.416
I wanna check on my race car.

16:30.483 --> 16:32.086
Kind of miss her when we're apart.

16:32.154 --> 16:34.124
Yeah, of course.
Oh, she's a beauty!

16:34.193 --> 16:36.529
But first, why don't we go upstairs?

16:36.596 --> 16:38.767
I'll show you the gun
that killed Hemingway.

16:38.836 --> 16:39.803
Huh? Come on.

16:39.871 --> 16:41.106
I just wanna check on my race car.

16:41.174 --> 16:43.577
Yeah, hang on. What kind
of host would I be

16:43.646 --> 16:46.250
if I didn't load you down
with premium outdoor man swag?

16:46.318 --> 16:47.887
- Huh?
- Ah, it's not necessary.

16:47.955 --> 16:49.657
Of course not, but...
Just one question.

16:49.725 --> 16:50.893
One question.

16:50.961 --> 16:54.167
Uh, what size
snowshoes do you wear? Hmm?

16:54.235 --> 16:57.173
I really don't wear snowshoes.

16:57.241 --> 16:59.912
- You don't wear snowshoes?
- No.

16:59.980 --> 17:02.283
Let's go to the warehouse.

17:02.351 --> 17:04.588
You haven't lived until
you've trudged laboriously

17:04.655 --> 17:06.392
through hip-deep snow, man.

17:06.459 --> 17:07.862
But I don't wear snowshoes.

17:07.930 --> 17:10.099
They go with everything.

17:12.638 --> 17:14.944
You know, Kyle, of all
the dumb things you've done,

17:15.012 --> 17:16.512
this is the dumbest.

17:16.579 --> 17:18.183
That may not be true.

17:18.251 --> 17:19.819
One time, I took my mom's cat Dorothy

17:19.887 --> 17:20.855
to a rookies game.

17:20.924 --> 17:23.295
Kyle, this isn't a talk show.

17:23.362 --> 17:26.568
Listen, we gotta get this car
back through the elephant doors.

17:26.636 --> 17:28.306
You push, I'm gonna steer.

17:28.373 --> 17:30.410
No can do. I tweaked my back.

17:30.477 --> 17:32.046
You'll just have to drive it.

17:32.113 --> 17:33.682
I'm not driving this.

17:33.750 --> 17:35.619
Look, Mr. B.,

17:35.687 --> 17:37.190
I saw the way you looked at this thing,

17:37.258 --> 17:38.492
and I know you can start it.

17:38.561 --> 17:39.628
I'm not gonna drive it.

17:39.696 --> 17:41.399
I dare you.

17:43.738 --> 17:47.145
I don't know much about you,
but I do know this--

17:47.213 --> 17:48.646
you love your family,

17:48.714 --> 17:50.550
you enjoy your life,

17:50.619 --> 17:51.988
and every now and then,
you need to do something

17:52.055 --> 17:53.324
you're probably gonna regret.

17:53.392 --> 17:55.695
This is that moment.

17:59.070 --> 18:01.041
I'm gonna start this car,

18:01.109 --> 18:03.312
I'm gonna drive this car,

18:03.380 --> 18:04.780
and if I don't get killed in this car,

18:04.848 --> 18:07.153
I'm gonna get out of the car
and kick your ass.

18:08.423 --> 18:11.429
I expect nothing less, sir.

18:11.497 --> 18:12.631
You might wanna back away.

18:43.698 --> 18:46.002
Look out below!

18:46.070 --> 18:48.273
Whoo-hoo!

18:48.341 --> 18:50.645
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

18:50.714 --> 18:52.215
Whoo!

18:52.282 --> 18:53.818
Try these goggles.

18:53.885 --> 18:55.688
They won't fog, even in fog.

18:55.756 --> 18:57.058
I just wanna see the car.

18:57.126 --> 18:58.629
Yes, of course.
How would you like to see

18:58.696 --> 19:00.633
the loading dock, huh? You like
boxes, right? Don't you?

19:00.700 --> 19:01.668
No, don't touch that.

19:07.181 --> 19:08.315
Hey, Tony, how's it going?

19:08.383 --> 19:09.785
We were...
We were just looking at...

19:09.853 --> 19:11.722
The... this, uh...
Side of the car.

19:11.790 --> 19:13.325
It's nice.
You know, it's...

19:13.393 --> 19:15.463
You know, the car, which is
right back where you left it.

19:15.531 --> 19:17.134
And there's no reason
to suspect otherwise.

19:17.201 --> 19:18.837
No.
None whatsoever.

19:18.905 --> 19:20.776
- I think I've got a new passion for racing, actually--
- Whoa!

19:20.843 --> 19:22.244
You know, there's a whole shipment of

19:22.312 --> 19:23.748
"shut the hell up" downstairs.
Why don't you unload it?

19:23.816 --> 19:25.417
Got it.

19:25.485 --> 19:28.023
Kids.

19:28.091 --> 19:30.729
You drove the car, didn't you, Mikey?

19:30.797 --> 19:32.632
Oh, come on.
What'd you expect?

19:32.701 --> 19:35.506
It was like putting a hot
apple pie in a windowsill.

19:35.574 --> 19:37.110
Give me the keys to your truck.

19:37.178 --> 19:38.545
Why?

19:38.613 --> 19:39.782
Well, you did doughnuts in my car,

19:39.850 --> 19:41.418
I'm gonna do doughnuts in your truck.

19:41.485 --> 19:43.288
I don't think that's a good
idea. It's an old classic.

19:43.356 --> 19:44.926
It-- you'd flip it or something.

19:44.993 --> 19:48.299
Yeah, but that possibility
is exactly what makes it fun.

19:49.971 --> 19:51.472
Uh, really, it's not the same thing.

19:51.540 --> 19:53.577
You know, and really,
nobody drives my truck but me.

19:53.645 --> 19:55.013
Tony, I understand how you feel.

19:55.082 --> 19:57.017
Just a second here. But two
wrongs do not make a right.

19:57.085 --> 19:59.188
I'm with Mike on this one.
I have to back him up.

19:59.256 --> 20:02.028
I'll double the size of that logo.

20:02.096 --> 20:03.564
Mike, give him your keys.

20:13.259 --> 20:14.259
Hi.

20:14.326 --> 20:15.662
Oh, good.
You stopped her.

20:15.730 --> 20:17.331
Actually, she didn't.

20:17.400 --> 20:19.069
You let her jump?

20:19.138 --> 20:20.672
I had to keep a close eye on her.

20:21.843 --> 20:23.712
You jumped, too?

20:23.781 --> 20:25.884
Yeah, it's possible.

20:25.951 --> 20:27.420
I've been sitting here racked with guilt

20:27.488 --> 20:28.891
that I betrayed a secret!

20:28.958 --> 20:30.960
I-I've barely been able to study!

20:31.028 --> 20:33.132
I mean, the teacher said we
wouldn't be tested on this,

20:33.200 --> 20:34.168
but it could be a trick.

20:34.235 --> 20:36.172
Oh, honey, Eve...

20:36.239 --> 20:38.978
Listen to me, sweetheart...

20:39.046 --> 20:41.149
Sweetheart, you are
a good and responsible person.

20:41.217 --> 20:43.989
It's very important.
But, Evie...

20:44.057 --> 20:47.128
Sometimes it's also important
to just... live a little!

20:47.196 --> 20:49.599
Mom used to get into bar fights!

20:49.667 --> 20:52.439
Ugh! Come on. Can no one
keep a secret in this house?

20:52.506 --> 20:53.675
Come on, Eve.

20:53.743 --> 20:55.246
I wanna show you the video of our jump.

20:55.314 --> 20:57.283
Not interested.

20:57.351 --> 20:58.460
Mom hit a bird on the way down.

20:59.589 --> 21:00.882
Now I'm interested.

21:02.694 --> 21:04.497
Come on!

21:05.568 --> 21:07.571
Wow.

21:07.638 --> 21:10.912
Oh. Whoo.

21:14.520 --> 21:15.588
Hmm.

21:15.655 --> 21:18.827
- Hey, V., V., V.!
- Oh, honey! Honey!

21:18.896 --> 21:20.365
I did something crazy today.

21:20.432 --> 21:21.700
I did something really crazy, too.

21:21.769 --> 21:23.137
I took Tony Stewart's car
out in the parking lot

21:23.205 --> 21:25.141
and did doughnuts!
In a NASCAR! Doughnuts!

21:25.210 --> 21:27.981
I jumped out of a plane!

21:28.049 --> 21:29.450
- Bedroom?
- Kids.

21:29.519 --> 21:30.387
Bomb shelter!

21:32.493 --> 21:35.144
