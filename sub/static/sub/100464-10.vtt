21:31.647 --> 21:32.982
So you don't know.

21:33.399 --> 21:36.026
You don't know. Maybe there’s a,
there's a chance you'll feel differently.

21:36.735 --> 21:38.028
‐ I don’t know. I don’t know.

21:38.028 --> 21:39.196
‐ That’s what I’m saying.
That’s what I’m saying.

21:39.196 --> 21:40.990
You don't, you don't know. You don't know.

21:40.990 --> 21:42.825
If you don't know there's not a chance,

21:42.825 --> 21:45.661
then there's...
there's still a chance, right?

21:46.620 --> 21:48.455
Like, if there was
a patient at a hospital,

21:48.455 --> 21:51.458
that was seriously, seriously ill
and... and the doctor said,

21:52.084 --> 21:54.003
"I don’t know
if this patient has a chance,"

21:54.003 --> 21:56.589
that doesn’t mean the patient's
definitely going to die, now does it?

21:56.589 --> 21:59.216
I mean, the patient might live, right?

21:59.216 --> 22:01.135
‐ Yeah, sure. Yes, yes.

22:01.135 --> 22:02.511
Yes, from that perspective,

22:02.928 --> 22:03.887
we have a chance.

22:03.887 --> 22:07.099
‐ So... there's a chance?

22:08.309 --> 22:09.310
‐ Oh, man, I‐‐

22:09.310 --> 22:12.229
‐ If you could just tell me
what our chance is?

22:12.813 --> 22:14.106
‐ I don't know.

22:14.106 --> 22:15.316
‐ If you could just tell me roughly?

22:15.316 --> 22:16.483
‐ Rob, I really don't know.

22:16.483 --> 22:17.818
‐ Like, percentage‐wise.
‐ I‐‐

22:18.652 --> 22:19.695
Nine.

22:21.697 --> 22:23.782
There's a nine percent chance, okay.

22:26.076 --> 22:27.036
‐ Nine percent?

22:27.786 --> 22:28.787
‐ Yeah.

22:31.040 --> 22:32.249
‐ Great.

22:34.960 --> 22:35.961
Great.

22:40.466 --> 22:41.467
