00:06.879 --> 00:08.574
<i>In the criminal justice system</i>

00:08.648 --> 00:12.550
<i>the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,</i>

00:12.618 --> 00:14.450
<i>the police
who investigate crime</i>

00:14.521 --> 00:17.285
<i>and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:17.357 --> 00:18.585
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:19.793 --> 00:22.125
He wants to video-conference
New Zealand? Great!

00:22.195 --> 00:23.822
Why do we have to
come in at 6:00 a.m.

00:23.897 --> 00:25.728
To stand in the back and wave.

00:25.799 --> 00:27.460
I mean, they don't
have to come in early.

00:27.567 --> 00:29.900
They're staying late.
It's 1:00 a.m. In Auckland.

00:29.971 --> 00:31.370
No, they're across
the date line.

00:31.439 --> 00:32.838
It's 1:00 a.m.
Yesterday.

00:32.907 --> 00:33.965
What's the rush?

00:34.042 --> 00:36.340
Actually,
it's 1:00 a.m. Tomorrow.

00:36.811 --> 00:38.301
So we're already too late.

00:38.680 --> 00:40.307
I just got out of bed
for nothing.

00:40.381 --> 00:41.370
Oh, my God.

00:46.555 --> 00:50.082
No purse. No identification.
No clothes.

00:50.492 --> 00:52.517
But it is a nice
compact crime scene.

00:52.594 --> 00:54.061
We're gonna have
to take numbers.

00:54.129 --> 00:55.528
Rey, what do you see?

00:55.597 --> 00:58.829
Looks like a bullet went in behind the ear.
No exit wounds.

00:58.902 --> 01:00.995
I make her 25,
maybe a little older.

01:01.438 --> 01:02.928
Can you roll her prints now?

01:03.073 --> 01:04.438
We gotta get started on the ID.

01:04.507 --> 01:06.065
Sure. Soon as
somebody leaves.

01:06.276 --> 01:08.676
I got you some Polaroids.
Pretty life-like.

01:08.878 --> 01:10.608
Other fellow said you
wanted the sign-in log.

01:10.715 --> 01:14.742
Oh, thanks. So, what time
do you start using this?

01:15.219 --> 01:16.846
Anybody comes in the
building after 8:00 p.m.,

01:16.921 --> 01:18.047
he has to sign in.

01:18.122 --> 01:19.384
All night till
6:00 in the morning.

01:19.457 --> 01:20.481
How about signing out?

01:20.558 --> 01:21.786
They never have to sign out.

01:21.859 --> 01:23.520
So if she came in
before 8:00 last night,

01:23.594 --> 01:24.994
you'd have no record of her?

01:25.063 --> 01:26.462
Not unless she
walked in like that.

01:26.999 --> 01:28.330
Then somebody might remember.

01:28.400 --> 01:31.995
Thanks, and if the shooter
came in before 8:00,

01:32.237 --> 01:33.704
wouldn't be any
record of him either.

01:33.772 --> 01:36.206
Well, at least one of them probably worked here.
You got Polaroids?

01:36.274 --> 01:38.607
Yeah. Excuse me.

01:38.678 --> 01:40.873
How many offices are
there in this building?

01:41.247 --> 01:42.475
Four hundred and seven.

01:43.149 --> 01:45.344
Four hundred and seven.
I'll cancel lunch.

01:47.000 --> 01:53.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

02:33.335 --> 02:35.327
The M.E. Had a look
at your Jane Doe.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.066
She died sometime last night.

02:37.140 --> 02:39.301
Shot in the head
with a.25.

02:39.376 --> 02:41.071
They happen to
say which.25?

02:41.144 --> 02:44.511
We ran down the names on the night sign-in.
Only two women.

02:44.581 --> 02:45.843
We reached them both by phone.

02:45.916 --> 02:47.110
How about the killer?

02:47.184 --> 02:49.710
If he signed in, he didn't
mark his name with a star.

02:49.787 --> 02:51.084
Her prints don't
come up with a hit.

02:51.155 --> 02:52.520
There's nothing
at Missing Persons.

02:52.590 --> 02:54.080
So you've got two weeks
before the M.E.

02:54.158 --> 02:55.625
Ships her off to
potter's field.

02:55.760 --> 02:58.388
To be buried by convicts,
six to a grave?

02:58.463 --> 03:00.693
Young woman like that, somebody's
gonna come looking for her.

03:00.765 --> 03:02.130
You gonna sit
and wait for them?

03:02.200 --> 03:03.725
Hey, we'll knock on doors.

03:03.802 --> 03:05.463
She came to that building
to see somebody,

03:05.537 --> 03:06.834
or somebody came to see her.

03:06.905 --> 03:08.634
Four hundred and seven doors?

03:09.408 --> 03:10.966
Start with the elevator.

03:13.579 --> 03:14.978
You know,
people don't appreciate

03:15.047 --> 03:16.879
what kind of improvements
we've made.

03:16.950 --> 03:19.714
Hey, used to be you'd ring
to go down at lunch time

03:19.786 --> 03:21.754
and you'd wait around
for 10 minutes.

03:21.821 --> 03:23.482
That CPU monitor the system?

03:23.556 --> 03:25.456
Now the elevators are smart.

03:25.525 --> 03:27.288
They know exactly
where to be at noon.

03:27.360 --> 03:28.793
Yeah, the Stage Deli.

03:28.862 --> 03:30.659
What we need to know,
Mr. Perkles,

03:30.730 --> 03:32.130
is where that elevator...

03:32.199 --> 03:33.860
That car.
Car three.

03:33.934 --> 03:36.027
Where car three made
its last stop

03:36.103 --> 03:38.731
before it went down to the
lobby with a body in it.

03:39.039 --> 03:41.735
Well, the car doesn't
remember where it was.

03:41.809 --> 03:45.075
But I got my COS
Car Out Of Service program.

03:45.480 --> 03:47.141
You see, whenever an elevator

03:47.215 --> 03:49.274
isn't called for 10 minutes,

03:49.351 --> 03:51.683
it times out until
it's called again.

03:53.488 --> 03:57.857
Let's see, car three
timed out at 3:07 a.m.

03:58.093 --> 04:00.255
Went back on line
at 4:02.

04:00.329 --> 04:04.459
Down button pushed on
thirty-one. 4:02 a.m.

04:05.434 --> 04:08.232
My God. That's what she
looked like, huh? After?

04:08.571 --> 04:10.095
Do you remember
seeing her last night?

04:10.173 --> 04:12.164
No. No, I don't think so.

04:12.675 --> 04:13.734
What about your boss?

04:13.810 --> 04:16.209
Well, Mr. Mack's in Tampa.
He left Monday.

04:16.747 --> 04:18.714
Did you see anybody
up here last night?

04:19.116 --> 04:20.515
I left early.

04:20.983 --> 04:24.249
Right. Your boss
is in Tampa. Thanks.

04:26.490 --> 04:28.083
Four hundred and six.

04:28.159 --> 04:29.956
The music publisher
was closed yesterday.

04:30.028 --> 04:33.088
Jewish holiday.
Bookkeeper didn't recognize the picture.

04:33.164 --> 04:35.758
There are five lawyers in 3128.

04:35.833 --> 04:37.027
They want the name
of the next of kin

04:37.101 --> 04:39.865
so they can sue the building
for inadequate security.

04:41.172 --> 04:43.141
Nobody home.
Let's ask the neighbors.

04:44.310 --> 04:46.778
Oh. Uh... They're back.
May I?

04:46.845 --> 04:49.678
No, it's my friend, Brenda.
She loves policemen.

04:50.382 --> 04:51.849
Yes, I'm a detective.

04:53.752 --> 04:55.414
No, the other
one's the cute one.

04:55.488 --> 04:57.956
It's Brenda.
She'll call you back.

04:58.592 --> 05:00.184
Who has the office
across the hall?

05:00.260 --> 05:01.284
His name's Maslin.

05:01.361 --> 05:03.226
But he's not
very friendly, though.

05:03.296 --> 05:05.059
What does he do?
He's a CPA.

05:05.131 --> 05:08.259
But he's got lots of women going in
and out of that office, you know?

05:08.401 --> 05:09.960
Good-looking ones, too.

05:10.037 --> 05:11.766
Why don't you go ask him?
He's not in.

05:11.839 --> 05:14.774
Really? That's odd.
He's always in by now.

05:14.842 --> 05:17.902
I'm leaving on vacation.
It's not that complicated.

05:18.246 --> 05:19.713
So, getting ready
for your trip and all,

05:19.780 --> 05:21.748
you didn't happen to work
late last night, did you?

05:21.816 --> 05:24.752
Yes. I was catching up on
quarterly tax reports.

05:25.187 --> 05:26.381
I'm an accountant.

05:26.455 --> 05:29.515
Right. That's why so many beautiful
women come to visit you.

05:29.591 --> 05:30.922
My accountant, Manny Loper,

05:30.993 --> 05:32.392
has to beat them off
with a stick.

05:32.461 --> 05:34.053
I do a lot of models.

05:35.097 --> 05:36.530
Their taxes.

05:36.632 --> 05:40.160
I got one from the Mason Agency,
and she told her friends.

05:40.236 --> 05:42.261
Not a lot of CPAs
know when mascara

05:42.338 --> 05:44.306
is allowable as
a business expense.

05:44.707 --> 05:45.867
I've got a plane to catch.

05:45.942 --> 05:47.466
We're just wondering,

05:47.543 --> 05:49.807
how come you didn't notice the
elevator you took to the lobby

05:49.879 --> 05:52.576
had a naked dead girl
lying on the floor?

05:52.916 --> 05:53.940
No, it didn't.

05:54.018 --> 05:56.509
You rang the bell
at 4:02 a.m.

05:56.754 --> 06:00.554
Car three responded.
Car three was the one with the body in it.

06:00.958 --> 06:02.823
You know all that?
Oh, yeah.

06:02.893 --> 06:06.295
You see, nowadays elevators
are very smart, Mr. Maslin.

06:06.831 --> 06:08.662
People don't appreciate it.

06:09.334 --> 06:12.394
My God. She must have been
in the first elevator.

06:12.470 --> 06:13.630
What do you mean, the first?

06:13.705 --> 06:15.366
I rang for an elevator,

06:15.473 --> 06:17.668
then remembered I'd left
some books in my office.

06:18.376 --> 06:20.402
When I got back, an elevator
door was just closing.

06:20.479 --> 06:22.970
I pushed the button again,
and another one came.

06:24.717 --> 06:25.809
She could have been a model.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.546
I say we get his client list.

06:27.620 --> 06:30.282
I don't think so.
Her body wasn't right. It wasn't?

06:30.856 --> 06:33.654
It was too short.
Her hips were too wide.

06:33.726 --> 06:36.423
That's pretty thorough work you
did at the crime scene, Rey.

06:36.496 --> 06:37.929
I was just doing
my job, Lennie.

06:37.998 --> 06:40.694
Yeah, right.
Mr. Perkles!

06:40.767 --> 06:43.133
Okay, I got all the reports.

06:43.203 --> 06:45.501
You know, there was
another call on 31

06:45.572 --> 06:46.596
a few minutes later.

06:46.673 --> 06:48.073
You didn't tell us that before.

06:48.142 --> 06:50.303
You didn't ask.
I mean, I told you what you asked.

06:50.411 --> 06:52.845
You said car three
timed out about 3:00 a.m.

06:52.914 --> 06:54.779
So it was used a little
before that, right?

06:54.849 --> 06:59.115
Yeah, 2:56. And I've got two calls
at 2:56 from the same floor.

06:59.187 --> 07:00.552
One up and one down.

07:00.888 --> 07:03.357
Looks like cars three
and five responded.

07:03.425 --> 07:04.414
Well, that's it, Lennie.

07:04.493 --> 07:06.552
Right. What?

07:07.363 --> 07:08.625
You shoot somebody
in an elevator,

07:08.697 --> 07:10.062
you gonna ride down
to the lobby with her,

07:10.132 --> 07:11.565
or are you going to
go straight down...

07:11.633 --> 07:14.466
While you send the body up
to the penthouse first.

07:14.536 --> 07:16.027
Which floor got
the double call?

07:16.106 --> 07:17.266
18.

07:18.241 --> 07:22.974
Each of these offices is rented separate.
Turnkey, short-term.

07:23.046 --> 07:25.537
You want an office tomorrow,
you got one.

07:25.615 --> 07:26.707
You're gone next week.

07:26.783 --> 07:28.307
What else is new? So...

07:28.385 --> 07:29.682
Was she here yesterday?

07:29.753 --> 07:31.221
Somebody down the hall
said they saw her

07:31.288 --> 07:33.051
coming out of
the bathroom around 6:00.

07:33.124 --> 07:34.853
I'm done
at 5:30 though.

07:34.992 --> 07:36.926
These guys' leases
give them me,

07:36.994 --> 07:38.859
eight hours a day, period.

07:39.163 --> 07:40.562
But she does look like someone

07:40.664 --> 07:42.222
I might have talked to
on the phone.

07:42.299 --> 07:45.030
She looks like someone you
might've talked to on the phone?

07:45.103 --> 07:46.695
Yeah. An out-of-towner.

07:47.172 --> 07:49.072
She called about 5:00.

07:49.474 --> 07:52.534
Had an appointment here, needed
directions from the hotel,

07:52.611 --> 07:54.135
wanted to know
how much time to allow.

07:54.212 --> 07:55.304
What hotel?

07:55.380 --> 07:57.974
The Barrington.
She was new in town.

07:58.049 --> 07:59.312
From somewhere in the Midwest.

07:59.719 --> 08:00.777
Oh, we talked a little bit.

08:00.853 --> 08:03.083
You talk about who she
was coming here to see?

08:03.156 --> 08:04.487
No, that didn't come up.

08:04.557 --> 08:07.219
She asked about the black guys that
sell the handbags in the street.

08:07.293 --> 08:09.056
You know,
"Are they really Gucci?"

08:09.128 --> 08:11.255
She...
She was really sweet.

08:11.731 --> 08:13.757
I mean, this is awful.
I'm sorry.

08:13.834 --> 08:16.735
Did she happen to mention where
in the Midwest she was from?

08:17.671 --> 08:20.231
Indiana. No, Wisconsin.

08:20.307 --> 08:21.569
It was someplace like that.

08:21.642 --> 08:23.473
Oh, I know.
The town had an Indian name.

08:24.144 --> 08:26.807
Hiawatha. No, it wasn't Hiawatha.
It was something.

08:26.881 --> 08:29.816
I don't know, but why don't
you guys check at the hotel?

08:35.756 --> 08:37.384
Yeah, we have
guests who look like that.

08:37.458 --> 08:38.756
And we have guests
who look like you.

08:38.827 --> 08:40.886
And we have guests who look like him.
It's a big hotel.

08:40.962 --> 08:44.091
And you could be a tiny bit
more helpful if you tried.

08:44.166 --> 08:45.827
I see a thousand faces a day.

08:45.901 --> 08:47.198
You got a printout
of your guests?

08:47.269 --> 08:49.703
Yeah. But without pictures.

08:49.772 --> 08:51.262
What about hometowns?

08:51.807 --> 08:55.005
Yeah. There.

08:55.378 --> 08:56.367
Thank you.

09:00.317 --> 09:02.308
Marilyn Stocker, Chicago.

09:02.385 --> 09:03.943
You know,
that's an Indian name.

09:04.020 --> 09:05.715
I think even that receptionist

09:05.789 --> 09:07.222
would have remembered Chicago.

09:10.628 --> 09:12.619
Oconomowoc, Wisconsin.

09:13.431 --> 09:15.626
No. Mister Lester Korn.

09:17.702 --> 09:20.865
Lucy Sullivan, Indiana.
Terre Haute.

09:20.938 --> 09:22.371
No, that's French.

09:22.440 --> 09:23.703
Consider the source.

09:25.010 --> 09:27.706
You see a Lucy Sullivan today?

09:28.146 --> 09:29.238
How would I know?

09:30.349 --> 09:31.475
What room is she in?

09:33.552 --> 09:37.216
Yes, in there. I saw her one or two
times when I was making the bed.

09:37.290 --> 09:38.814
Did you make up the bed today?

09:38.892 --> 09:40.723
Yes. There was nobody there.

09:41.227 --> 09:43.422
Yeah, just suitcases
and clothes.

09:43.496 --> 09:44.622
You guys want to go in?

09:44.831 --> 09:45.957
Yeah.

09:51.338 --> 09:54.000
Subway map.
She was new in the city.

09:54.642 --> 09:56.234
She wasn't afraid
to ride the subway.

10:06.054 --> 10:07.112
What do you want?

10:07.489 --> 10:08.513
Who are you?

10:08.790 --> 10:11.258
I have some money.
You don't have to hurt me.

10:11.426 --> 10:14.088
No, no, lady, look.
We're police.

10:14.663 --> 10:16.858
Police?
What do you want?

10:17.132 --> 10:19.829
We're investigating the
murder of Lucy Sullivan.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.102
I'm Lucy Sullivan.

10:23.539 --> 10:25.598
Miss, would you step out
here for a minute, please?

10:29.011 --> 10:31.912
A woman was found with no
identification on her.

10:31.981 --> 10:33.950
Now, the trail led us here.

10:34.017 --> 10:36.679
And she looks like you.
She does?

10:37.688 --> 10:42.148
My sister, Joanne, she didn't
come back to the room last night.

10:42.225 --> 10:44.090
There's only one of you
registered here.

10:44.227 --> 10:46.092
We were saving the surcharge.

10:48.733 --> 10:49.757
Here.

10:53.771 --> 10:57.207
We took that at South Street Seaport.
That's me with Joanne.

10:57.942 --> 10:59.671
When was the last
time you saw your sister?

11:00.211 --> 11:01.270
Is it her?

11:03.449 --> 11:04.507
Why don't you just get dressed?

11:04.583 --> 11:07.746
No. If my sister is dead,
I want to know.

11:14.693 --> 11:15.888
Oh, my God.

11:17.998 --> 11:19.022
Joanne.

11:22.302 --> 11:23.291
What happened?

11:28.008 --> 11:30.375
That's her. Joanne.

11:31.112 --> 11:32.204
I'm sorry.

11:34.048 --> 11:36.983
This was our best time
together in years.

11:38.052 --> 11:41.749
I'd always wanted to come
to New York on a vacation.

11:41.822 --> 11:43.984
I was so happy
when she showed up.

11:44.860 --> 11:47.090
So you weren't expecting her?

11:48.096 --> 11:52.226
She knocked on my door the first
night and said, "Room service."

11:53.602 --> 11:54.796
Where was she living?

11:55.537 --> 11:57.164
She moved a lot.

11:57.239 --> 12:00.175
She traveled, for some
kind of a sales job.

12:01.411 --> 12:04.744
She told me it ended and she
was looking for a new one.

12:04.814 --> 12:06.873
That's where
she was going yesterday.

12:06.949 --> 12:08.473
To a new job?

12:08.551 --> 12:11.042
An interview.
I don't know where.

12:11.889 --> 12:14.483
Weren't you worried
when she didn't come back?

12:14.591 --> 12:16.718
There were a couple of nights
when she didn't come back.

12:16.794 --> 12:18.386
She had a boyfriend.

12:18.595 --> 12:19.619
Who?

12:21.231 --> 12:25.429
I never met him.
She told me he wasn't "MDR" yet.

12:26.371 --> 12:29.932
That was our old joke.
When my parents were alive

12:30.608 --> 12:33.543
and we were dating in high
school, we would only bring home

12:33.611 --> 12:37.206
the ones that were "MDR."
Mom and Dad Ready.

12:38.349 --> 12:39.840
Some boys never were.

12:41.120 --> 12:43.145
And those were
the ones Joanne liked?

12:44.824 --> 12:45.848
Yeah.

12:47.526 --> 12:50.154
Hotel phone records.
4:00 p.m. Call

12:50.229 --> 12:52.220
from the victim's room
to that office.

12:52.298 --> 12:55.200
There have been 50 tenants through
that office in the last year.

12:55.268 --> 12:57.395
Half of them forget to turn
the keys in when they leave.

12:57.471 --> 12:59.632
Any calls to a boyfriend?

12:59.706 --> 13:03.073
Nope. Nobody, ready for
Mom and Dad or not.

13:03.443 --> 13:07.243
Is it just me, or does it strike
you odd that Joanne Sullivan

13:07.314 --> 13:10.910
happened to move into her sister's
hotel room without registering?

13:10.985 --> 13:13.385
Perfectly normal, if you're
on the run from something.

13:13.454 --> 13:17.083
No fixed address.
Mystery boyfriend. Vague job.

13:17.158 --> 13:19.683
Here we go. "Warrant out for
the arrest of Joanne Dunbar,

13:19.761 --> 13:22.253
"a. k.a. Joanne Sullivan." Hmm.

13:22.898 --> 13:24.798
That would explain
her discretion.

13:24.867 --> 13:27.734
"Contact New Jersey State Police.
Lieutenant Jeffrey London."

13:29.972 --> 13:32.600
She's dead. But you gotta
look on the bright side.

13:32.674 --> 13:35.199
I get to come over here, courtesy
of the state of New Jersey,

13:35.277 --> 13:36.870
and tell you all about it.

13:37.514 --> 13:40.039
You really ought to
try these potatoes.

13:40.450 --> 13:42.418
Don't they have food in
New Jersey, Lieutenant?

13:42.485 --> 13:45.079
Yeah. But in New Jersey,
I gotta pay for it.

13:46.022 --> 13:47.182
Well, I hate to bother you,

13:47.257 --> 13:49.248
but you have something for us?

13:49.325 --> 13:50.588
Mmm-hmm.

13:51.462 --> 13:54.329
Pictures.
Casino surveillance.

13:57.301 --> 13:59.201
That's her husband,
Billy Dunbar.

13:59.270 --> 14:02.671
All-around con man and sometime
blackjack dealer in Atlantic City.

14:02.740 --> 14:05.209
Who's the lady hiding behind the
scarf and the dark glasses?

14:05.277 --> 14:08.269
The late lamented.
That's the best picture we have.

14:08.680 --> 14:11.308
Dunbar's gonna have to train
somebody else to handmuck with,

14:11.383 --> 14:12.850
which shouldn't be hard.

14:12.918 --> 14:15.011
He runs through lots of
wives and girlfriends.

14:15.086 --> 14:16.075
"Handmuck"?

14:16.488 --> 14:18.684
Is that something you do with
girlfriends in New Jersey?

14:18.758 --> 14:20.487
Yeah, if you cheat
at blackjack.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.026
Dunbar's wife sits down
at his table,

14:24.096 --> 14:25.996
different nights,
different disguises.

14:26.599 --> 14:29.363
She steals a card from
his deck with his help,

14:29.635 --> 14:31.626
sticks it in her hand
when she needs it,

14:31.704 --> 14:33.536
hides the other card
in her pants.

14:33.607 --> 14:34.938
Nice way to lower the odds.

14:35.142 --> 14:37.372
Oh, yeah.
Casinos frown on it,

14:37.444 --> 14:40.174
but the wise guys who run some
of the places Dunbar's pulled

14:40.247 --> 14:41.908
this stunt really frown on it.

14:43.984 --> 14:47.614
Here are the warrants.
Fraud, for your stiff and Dunbar,

14:47.689 --> 14:48.815
in case he shows up.

14:48.890 --> 14:50.084
You have any idea where he is?

14:50.158 --> 14:53.423
Nope. But if he turns up dead,
give me a call, will you?

14:53.561 --> 14:55.825
I really want to try
the soft-shell crab.

14:58.166 --> 15:01.102
They want $800
to send her home.

15:01.503 --> 15:05.564
But I don't know...
We don't have any relatives left.

15:06.308 --> 15:08.970
The man said that I should
consider cremation.

15:09.044 --> 15:11.672
I know this is
still a difficult time,

15:12.281 --> 15:13.646
but we need you to
look at these pictures.

15:13.716 --> 15:15.014
Did you find something?

15:15.085 --> 15:16.518
Do you know who killed Joanne?

15:16.586 --> 15:18.884
Go ahead and take a
look at these, okay?

15:19.456 --> 15:23.517
Is that her?
That's Joanne.

15:25.195 --> 15:26.457
Do you know
who this is?

15:26.529 --> 15:27.723
Who, the dealer?

15:28.131 --> 15:29.929
He was married
to your sister.

15:30.001 --> 15:31.593
No, she wasn't married.

15:31.669 --> 15:33.159
Actually, she was.

15:33.304 --> 15:34.794
Last year, in Atlantic City.

15:37.408 --> 15:40.775
She was in trouble, wasn't she?

15:40.845 --> 15:42.403
I knew something was wrong.

15:43.248 --> 15:45.944
If only she'd told me.

15:46.018 --> 15:47.349
Did you ever see him with her?

15:47.819 --> 15:50.151
No. Do you think
that he killed her?

15:50.222 --> 15:52.213
We don't know.
He was her husband.

15:53.625 --> 15:54.649
That's Mr. Johnson.

15:54.726 --> 15:55.715
You know him?

15:55.794 --> 15:58.093
Yeah, sure.
Except his hair is different now.

15:58.164 --> 16:00.223
It's a little bit more
George Clooney.

16:00.300 --> 16:01.597
That's his office.

16:01.668 --> 16:02.794
Well, is he in?

16:02.869 --> 16:04.461
Well, I haven't
seen him around lately.

16:04.537 --> 16:07.097
I mean, he owes
a month's rent, so...

16:07.240 --> 16:09.367
What does he use
that office for?

16:09.442 --> 16:10.637
Lmport-export.

16:11.111 --> 16:13.341
I don't know
import what, export what.

16:13.514 --> 16:15.573
It's locked.
I'll call CSU.

16:16.450 --> 16:18.315
Do you think he
killed her in there?

16:18.385 --> 16:20.046
Hey, do me a favor.

16:20.120 --> 16:21.519
Would you mind just standing
over there, please?

16:21.588 --> 16:23.818
Hey, you know, he always
seemed perfectly nice.

16:24.091 --> 16:27.061
Oh, yeah. And on his lease
he gave a home address

16:27.128 --> 16:28.959
that put him in the
middle of the East River.

16:29.030 --> 16:30.554
You didn't think
that was strange?

16:30.632 --> 16:33.760
Well, I didn't go there.
Oh, wait a minute. Wait!

16:36.604 --> 16:40.974
I got something. In the vent.
.25 caliber bullet.

16:41.177 --> 16:42.542
Like it slipped through
somebody's fingers

16:42.611 --> 16:43.635
while they were loading a gun.

16:43.713 --> 16:46.409
Hey, I always get butterflies
just before I shoot somebody.

16:46.482 --> 16:48.109
I just remembered something.

16:48.184 --> 16:50.448
I took a message for him the other day.
Does that help?

16:51.220 --> 16:52.585
"Please call Harry Shapiro.

16:52.655 --> 16:54.647
"I'm interested in
your proposition."

16:55.759 --> 16:57.590
<i>I answered his ad
in the Wall Street Journal.</i>

16:57.661 --> 17:00.095
I did some research.
It looked to check out.

17:00.897 --> 17:02.888
You're here to tell me
Johnson's a con man?

17:02.966 --> 17:05.161
His real name is
William Dunbar.

17:05.769 --> 17:06.964
That's not a good sign, is it?

17:07.038 --> 17:08.164
What was he selling?

17:08.239 --> 17:09.365
Butter.
To Saudi Arabia.

17:09.440 --> 17:10.531
Hey, Shapiro!

17:11.309 --> 17:13.242
What, from an office
building in Midtown?

17:13.344 --> 17:15.073
Well, they have to
buy it from somewhere.

17:15.146 --> 17:17.340
In all those pictures
of sand and oil wells,

17:17.415 --> 17:18.848
you never saw any cows,
did you?

17:19.050 --> 17:21.246
His proposition had nothing
to do with gambling?

17:21.319 --> 17:23.982
It was a sure thing.
Government money.

17:24.056 --> 17:25.717
The Dairy Export
Incentive Program.

17:26.258 --> 17:28.249
You buy butter
at three grand a ton,

17:28.327 --> 17:30.318
sell it overseas for 2,500.

17:30.396 --> 17:33.331
Uncle Sam pays you the
difference and then some.

17:33.399 --> 17:34.661
Keeps the farmers happy.

17:34.733 --> 17:37.259
Johnson, or whatever his
name is, had all the forms.

17:37.337 --> 17:38.702
Do you know where
we can find him?

17:38.772 --> 17:40.330
It just made me laugh,
you know?

17:40.407 --> 17:41.840
Me, Harry Shapiro,

17:42.008 --> 17:44.499
buying butter from farmers
and selling it to Arabs.

17:44.611 --> 17:46.408
Dr. Shapiro...
Yeah.

17:47.280 --> 17:49.875
He took me out to dinner one
night to tell me all about it.

17:49.950 --> 17:51.713
Afterwards, I dropped
him off at his place.

17:55.523 --> 17:57.354
Are you sure
this is okay?

17:57.425 --> 17:58.892
We knocked on the door.
Nobody answered.

17:58.959 --> 18:01.723
Don't you need a search
warrant or something?

18:01.796 --> 18:04.163
Or something.

18:04.232 --> 18:07.463
Arrest warrant, issued by the
sovereign state of New Jersey.

18:07.536 --> 18:08.935
New Jersey?
When I go to the Meadowlands,

18:09.004 --> 18:10.301
I tear up
their parking tickets.

18:10.372 --> 18:11.703
Give me the key.

18:20.883 --> 18:22.180
Clear.

18:24.387 --> 18:25.445
Nobody here.

18:27.523 --> 18:28.751
Surprise, surprise.

18:28.825 --> 18:30.520
I told you,
he hasn't been here.

18:30.593 --> 18:32.323
Well, maybe he was
just being quiet.

18:32.429 --> 18:34.590
I only seen him
a couple of times total.

18:34.665 --> 18:35.962
He just moved in last month.

18:36.100 --> 18:38.364
If he did leave town,
he's traveling light.

18:38.702 --> 18:41.466
You ever see a Mrs.
Dunbar around here?

18:41.538 --> 18:43.028
I only seen a woman once.

18:43.107 --> 18:46.271
Couple of days ago, she came
walking out of here at 8 a.m.

18:46.744 --> 18:48.473
Yeah? This her?

18:50.115 --> 18:53.744
Yeah, something like that, only her
hair was darker and straighter.

18:54.185 --> 18:55.209
You hear that, Rey?

18:55.286 --> 18:57.379
Yeah. Look at this.

18:58.022 --> 19:00.617
.25 caliber.
And this.

19:03.295 --> 19:05.627
That's her.
And that's him with her.

19:06.966 --> 19:09.628
The grieving sister,
Lucy Sullivan.

19:10.669 --> 19:12.967
You said you never
heard of William Dunbar.

19:13.506 --> 19:15.065
You told us you didn't
know who that was.

19:15.976 --> 19:17.841
You lied to us, Lucy.

19:17.911 --> 19:20.004
Is that how people
behave in Terre Haute?

19:20.080 --> 19:21.877
I don't know
what's going on here.

19:21.948 --> 19:25.111
Here's what's going on.
You and William Dunbar.

19:25.185 --> 19:26.550
You know what we think?

19:26.620 --> 19:28.555
We think you knew your
sister's husband real well.

19:29.123 --> 19:30.590
No.
You know what else?

19:30.658 --> 19:32.683
We traced your sister
to your hotel

19:32.760 --> 19:35.786
because she called that
building to ask for directions.

19:36.297 --> 19:37.662
Now, why would she
need to call to ask

19:37.732 --> 19:39.791
for directions to her
own husband's office?

19:39.867 --> 19:41.357
I don't understand.

19:41.469 --> 19:43.802
You know who might need
to call for directions?

19:44.239 --> 19:45.900
You. If you were
going over there

19:45.974 --> 19:48.135
to meet Dunbar for a
little fun and games.

19:48.210 --> 19:49.643
But your sister,
she figured it out

19:49.711 --> 19:51.338
and went over there,
too, right?

19:51.413 --> 19:53.381
So what happen?
She walked in on you with her husband?

19:53.482 --> 19:55.849
No!
Then how did she end up dead?

19:56.486 --> 19:58.886
Let me guess.
Mom always liked her best?

20:01.524 --> 20:04.425
This is it. This is the gun
that killed your sister.

20:04.561 --> 20:06.654
It's been tested.
I don't know anything about guns.

20:06.729 --> 20:08.026
Why don't you show us
how you did it?

20:08.097 --> 20:09.121
Maybe it was
self-defense.

20:09.199 --> 20:10.394
Maybe...
Maybe she was attacking you.

20:10.534 --> 20:11.728
That's not what happened!

20:11.802 --> 20:13.235
It didn't happen!

20:13.637 --> 20:16.800
Miss Sullivan, you might
want to see this fax.

20:16.874 --> 20:19.206
A fingerprint team
was in your hotel room,

20:19.343 --> 20:21.709
and they found
a very nice print

20:21.779 --> 20:24.647
on the makeup mirror
that matches one in here.

20:24.950 --> 20:28.078
A lot of people forget
to wipe down the magazine.

20:28.787 --> 20:29.879
I want a lawyer.

20:30.388 --> 20:32.185
Honey, you need one.

20:32.257 --> 20:34.748
You're under arrest for the
murder of Joanne Sullivan.

20:34.826 --> 20:36.418
You have the right
to remain silent.

20:36.494 --> 20:37.859
Anything you say can and will

20:37.929 --> 20:39.727
be used against you
in a court of law.

20:42.335 --> 20:45.771
Sisters killing sisters.
I haven't seen that for a week or two.

20:45.838 --> 20:48.033
Good. There'll be a place for
this one at Bedford Hills.

20:48.107 --> 20:50.200
No witnesses, no statement...

20:50.977 --> 20:54.106
We can show motive,
access to the murder weapon.

20:54.181 --> 20:57.446
Her fingerprint is consistent
with a partial on the gun.

20:57.517 --> 20:58.541
"Consistent."

20:58.619 --> 21:00.849
Her lawyer's cranking up
his billable hours.

21:00.921 --> 21:02.320
Motion to suppress the gun

21:02.389 --> 21:04.380
and the photograph of her
with her sister's husband.

21:04.558 --> 21:06.151
Meaning her motive,

21:06.227 --> 21:08.855
access to the murder weapon
and fingerprint.

21:09.464 --> 21:10.522
We have the facts.

21:11.199 --> 21:13.258
I think we'll
convince Judge Marks...

21:13.701 --> 21:15.066
Nathan Marks?

21:15.803 --> 21:17.134
Luck of the draw.

21:17.205 --> 21:19.264
Make sure your airbags
are working.

21:21.744 --> 21:24.110
I don't care what some A.
D.A. Agreed upon.

21:24.179 --> 21:26.739
Next time you see me, look
at what's on my shoulders.

21:26.815 --> 21:29.375
It's a head, not a handle.
I don't rubber stamp.

21:30.419 --> 21:32.080
You're late.
I'm sorry.

21:32.788 --> 21:35.986
A 30-30 hearing was delayed over in...
Never mind.

21:36.760 --> 21:37.749
Miss Ross,

21:37.827 --> 21:40.387
I believe we last had the
pleasure when I was sentencing

21:40.463 --> 21:42.931
some liar represented
by your ex-husband.

21:43.033 --> 21:44.796
I've been meaning to thank you.

21:45.468 --> 21:49.303
Lovely blouse. Rare to see
single-ply silk with that texture.

21:50.107 --> 21:53.008
Must feel very nice.
Italian weave?

21:54.578 --> 21:57.138
Chinese.
Ah. They're improving.

21:57.748 --> 21:58.908
Your Honor...

21:59.450 --> 22:00.576
Yes, Mr. Gillum?

22:01.185 --> 22:02.483
If you're ready to proceed?

22:02.554 --> 22:03.646
Of course.

22:03.722 --> 22:05.280
The police seized
the evidence in question

22:05.357 --> 22:07.052
when they entered
William Dunbar's apartment

22:07.125 --> 22:08.285
with an out-of-state
arrest warrant...

22:08.360 --> 22:10.851
That had been properly lodged
with a clerk of this court.

22:10.929 --> 22:12.521
At most, they had
the right to ascertain

22:12.597 --> 22:14.121
whether or not William
Dunbar was present.

22:14.199 --> 22:16.190
They had no right to
search beyond that.

22:16.268 --> 22:19.500
One of the detectives opened
a closet door. He saw the gun.

22:19.806 --> 22:22.036
On a shelf
two feet over his head.

22:22.909 --> 22:25.969
The issue here is the plain view exception?
It is, Your Honor.

22:26.045 --> 22:27.205
So we're going
to get a lot of diagrams

22:27.280 --> 22:28.941
of room layouts
and sight lines,

22:29.015 --> 22:31.382
and what was where and who
was standing on top of what.

22:31.452 --> 22:32.544
I can have them by tomorrow.

22:32.619 --> 22:33.950
And he'll come with
different diagrams,

22:34.021 --> 22:36.717
and we'll all sit around
with rulers, protractors.

22:37.524 --> 22:39.719
I've got a better idea.
Let's go to the apartment.

22:41.829 --> 22:42.818
All of us?

22:42.896 --> 22:44.056
Yes. We'll have a picnic.

22:44.999 --> 22:47.160
Mr. McCoy, bring your cops.

22:50.338 --> 22:51.327
It was there.

22:52.040 --> 22:54.474
Like that?
Just dangling on the edge like that?

22:54.642 --> 22:58.271
Well, enough so I could see it.
Maybe... Maybe there.

22:58.981 --> 22:59.970
Maybe?

23:00.249 --> 23:03.377
Or maybe there, or maybe there.

23:04.754 --> 23:06.221
Where were you,
Detective Briscoe?

23:07.056 --> 23:09.217
Me? I was here.

23:09.692 --> 23:11.057
Maybe here?

23:11.127 --> 23:12.287
Definitely here.

23:12.796 --> 23:13.785
Did you see the gun?

23:13.864 --> 23:15.263
I wasn't looking at the closet.

23:15.499 --> 23:16.761
I'll take that as a no.

23:17.501 --> 23:20.368
Detective Curtis.
How tall are you?

23:20.604 --> 23:22.037
6'2 ".
Really?

23:22.672 --> 23:24.071
Excuse me.

23:27.044 --> 23:28.068
I don't see the gun.

23:28.146 --> 23:29.875
He must have seen it,
Your Honor.

23:30.381 --> 23:32.178
Why else did he reach for it?

23:33.117 --> 23:34.141
And the photos?

23:34.218 --> 23:36.049
When I reached for the
gun, I felt them.

23:36.821 --> 23:39.619
Several courts have adopted
a plain touch exception

23:39.690 --> 23:41.215
to the warrant requirement.

23:41.293 --> 23:44.490
Nice try, Miss Ross. Not this one.
The search was illegal.

23:44.730 --> 23:47.756
That only disallows use of the
evidence against Mr. Dunbar.

23:47.833 --> 23:49.892
We can still use it
against Miss Sullivan.

23:49.968 --> 23:52.459
She had no expectation
of privacy here.

23:52.671 --> 23:55.163
But you're the one that alleges
my client was having an affair

23:55.241 --> 23:57.004
with the occupant
of this apartment.

23:57.076 --> 23:58.771
You're the one with
a witness who claims

23:58.845 --> 24:01.211
she left here at 8:00 a.m.
One morning.

24:01.448 --> 24:03.279
Several days before the search.

24:03.583 --> 24:05.778
She has no standing,
unless she spent the night

24:05.852 --> 24:07.683
immediately before
the search here.

24:07.954 --> 24:10.515
<i>People v. Ortiz.
How about that, Mr. Gillum?</i>

24:10.591 --> 24:12.991
Client want to make
a naughty confession?

24:13.160 --> 24:15.185
No, she won't incriminate
herself by strengthening

24:15.262 --> 24:17.730
the alleged motive
for this crime. No.

24:17.798 --> 24:20.528
You could argue common
sense and experience.

24:22.269 --> 24:24.397
Miss Ross, when you leave

24:24.473 --> 24:26.634
a man's apartment
at 8:00 in the morning,

24:27.042 --> 24:29.909
did you just drop in for a
coffee and a sweet roll?

24:31.279 --> 24:32.906
Am I a defense witness, Judge?

24:32.981 --> 24:34.073
You're an officer of the court,

24:34.149 --> 24:36.083
aiding in our search
for the truth.

24:36.151 --> 24:38.347
You sample a man's
hospitality once,

24:38.421 --> 24:40.548
are you likely to return
to sample it again soon?

24:40.723 --> 24:42.953
Your Honor,
this is not appropriate.

24:43.025 --> 24:47.792
If I left at 8:00 a.m.,
I wasn't too impressed.

24:48.264 --> 24:50.232
I don't think I'd
be rushing back.

24:50.500 --> 24:51.866
Can't argue with that.

24:52.369 --> 24:55.805
Defense motion is denied.
Evidence against Miss Sullivan is admitted.

24:59.209 --> 25:01.905
I thought he was going to ask your
favorite sexual positions next.

25:02.980 --> 25:05.973
I grew up with four brothers.
Marks is an amateur.

25:06.050 --> 25:07.779
You don't mind
that kind of thing?

25:08.086 --> 25:10.213
Would you rather
he ruled against us?

25:10.288 --> 25:13.849
Guess I'll have to unlearn some
of my sensitivity training.

25:14.259 --> 25:15.351
If we have another hearing,

25:15.426 --> 25:17.553
you'll model silk
for him again?

25:17.629 --> 25:20.497
Trust me. He would have been
just as big a fan of rayon.

25:25.504 --> 25:28.268
She's the one I saw leaving Mr.
Dunbar's apartment.

25:28.941 --> 25:31.205
Did you see her arriving,
Mr. Wilkins?

25:31.277 --> 25:32.938
No. And I got there
before 7:00.

25:33.012 --> 25:35.709
I wanted to fix the railing
before the kids left for school.

25:35.782 --> 25:38.615
So either Miss Sullivan
arrived very early,

25:38.685 --> 25:39.982
or else she spent the night?

25:40.053 --> 25:42.044
Objection.
Calls for a conclusion.

25:42.122 --> 25:43.350
Cut it out, Mr. McCoy.

25:43.657 --> 25:44.646
Sustained.

25:46.426 --> 25:47.860
I have no further questions.

25:50.965 --> 25:55.265
Mr. Wilkins, your
identification of the defendant

25:55.369 --> 25:57.166
wasn't based on a lineup,
was it?

25:57.538 --> 25:59.972
No. The police just
showed you a photograph

26:00.041 --> 26:01.873
of Miss Sullivan.
That's right.

26:02.210 --> 26:03.973
How long did you see her for?

26:04.046 --> 26:06.640
I don't know.
For a few seconds.

26:07.249 --> 26:08.238
Just a few seconds?

26:08.951 --> 26:10.612
Isn't it possible
that seeing that picture

26:10.686 --> 26:12.313
helped you form a mental image?

26:12.854 --> 26:15.516
Now who's calling for a
conclusion, Mr. Gillum?

26:16.025 --> 26:17.583
Miss Sullivan, stand up.

26:19.596 --> 26:21.894
Is this the woman
you saw, Mr. Wilkins?

26:22.165 --> 26:23.496
Yeah. Yes, sir.

26:23.566 --> 26:24.555
That hair?

26:25.068 --> 26:26.467
Yes.
That body type?

26:27.170 --> 26:28.569
Yes.
Really?

26:28.871 --> 26:32.308
But you're sure it was her?
Not, say, Miss Ross?

26:32.376 --> 26:34.537
Miss Ross,
would you stand up, please?

26:37.114 --> 26:39.605
Similar body type,
wouldn't you say?

26:39.683 --> 26:41.947
Yeah.
But it was the other one.

26:43.020 --> 26:48.084
Good. Mr. Gillum, he's your witness.
Any more questions?

26:55.567 --> 26:58.503
The defendant told us she
didn't know William Dunbar.

26:59.105 --> 27:00.732
Did there come a time
when you began to suspect

27:00.873 --> 27:02.500
that she was
not telling the truth?

27:02.575 --> 27:05.100
Yes. When we found the picture
in Mr. Dunbar's apartment.

27:05.177 --> 27:06.940
She's...
She's hugging him.

27:08.314 --> 27:11.078
What was Mr.
Dunbar's relation to the defendant?

27:11.150 --> 27:13.346
He was married to her sister,
the deceased.

27:13.420 --> 27:14.853
What else,
if anything,

27:14.921 --> 27:17.321
did you find
in Mr. Dunbar's apartment?

27:18.659 --> 27:20.320
A.25 caliber Ruger pistol.

27:23.930 --> 27:25.864
This.25 caliber
Ruger pistol?

27:27.101 --> 27:28.090
What is that?

27:28.870 --> 27:30.929
A court officer will fine and have
you removed from my courtroom.

27:31.005 --> 27:33.030
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
It's my pager.

27:34.642 --> 27:36.837
The People request a
recess, Your Honor.

27:38.713 --> 27:39.975
Some kids found him.

27:40.749 --> 27:42.080
His wallet was in
his back pocket.

27:42.151 --> 27:43.550
I thought you'd want to know.

27:46.021 --> 27:48.182
Driver's license.
William Dunbar.

27:49.692 --> 27:51.216
You may not want to
get too close, Miss.

27:51.293 --> 27:52.817
He's been in the river a while.

27:55.098 --> 27:57.293
Your bad luck he
floated up this side.

27:57.367 --> 28:00.859
Yeah. I'll have to buy my own
dinner, unless you're treating.

28:01.104 --> 28:03.504
I assume the cause of
death was not drowning.

28:04.874 --> 28:06.341
Back of his head is blown away.

28:06.409 --> 28:08.275
And dumped into the Hudson.
Mob hit.

28:10.581 --> 28:12.708
If I was still a defense
attorney, Jack...

28:12.783 --> 28:14.944
You'd cream us with this.
Yeah.

28:15.720 --> 28:18.883
Joanne and I went
shopping at Saks Fifth Avenue.

28:19.757 --> 28:21.224
Joanne bought me a scarf.

28:22.561 --> 28:25.121
Then I went back to the
hotel to take a nap.

28:25.397 --> 28:27.331
Joanne told me
that she was going

28:27.399 --> 28:29.299
to go and see
somebody about a job.

28:30.035 --> 28:31.764
I didn't know if
that was true or not.

28:31.837 --> 28:33.702
She had been acting strange.

28:33.905 --> 28:35.634
Strange?
Did you know why?

28:35.707 --> 28:37.369
No. Not then.

28:37.777 --> 28:40.041
We've heard testimony from a
New Jersey police officer

28:40.279 --> 28:43.476
that your sister and her husband
swindled gambling clubs.

28:43.950 --> 28:45.042
You knew nothing about this?

28:45.118 --> 28:47.416
Joanne told me
that she was in sales.

28:48.221 --> 28:50.383
But when she showed up at the hotel,

28:50.457 --> 28:53.221
she told me not to tell
anybody that she was there.

28:53.827 --> 28:56.125
She seemed afraid.
Of you?

28:56.230 --> 29:02.726
No. Isn't it obvious?
She was hiding from somebody.

29:03.570 --> 29:04.833
They killed her husband.

29:04.906 --> 29:06.533
They must have killed her, too.

29:08.109 --> 29:10.373
Why did you tell the police

29:12.180 --> 29:14.671
that you didn't
know William Dunbar?

29:15.884 --> 29:17.818
That picture.

29:17.886 --> 29:20.412
Joanne and I went for a
walk in Central Park.

29:21.056 --> 29:25.322
He started talking to us.
I thought that he was trying to pick us up.

29:25.594 --> 29:27.994
I didn't even know
that Joanne knew him.

29:28.264 --> 29:30.960
They must have arranged
to meet that way.

29:31.033 --> 29:32.729
Joanne took that picture.

29:32.936 --> 29:34.335
And why were you
seen leaving

29:34.404 --> 29:36.770
William Dunbar's
apartment at 8 a.m.,

29:36.840 --> 29:38.398
two days before
your sister was murdered?

29:38.475 --> 29:40.375
I don't know.
That wasn't me.

29:40.677 --> 29:42.804
The building superintendent
says it was.

29:42.879 --> 29:44.437
That must have been Joanne.

29:44.514 --> 29:46.710
At 8:00 that morning
I was buying a ticket

29:46.784 --> 29:48.445
for a Gray Line bus tour.

29:50.621 --> 29:51.849
Do you recognize this?

29:52.323 --> 29:55.053
Yes. That's the ticket I bought.
Mmm-hmm.

29:55.126 --> 29:59.028
And is this the receipt for the traveler's
check you cashed to buy the ticket?

29:59.096 --> 30:02.464
Marked 8:00 a.m.
, May 11th. Yes.

30:02.534 --> 30:04.593
That's my signature
and that's the clerk's.

30:05.003 --> 30:09.269
Your Honor, I offer these into
evidence as defense exhibits H and I.

30:11.677 --> 30:14.646
I talked to the ticket clerk.
He doesn't remember her,

30:14.713 --> 30:16.238
but he swears he wouldn't
have cashed the check

30:16.316 --> 30:18.580
without looking at her credit
card and signature for ID.

30:18.685 --> 30:19.709
Terrific.

30:19.786 --> 30:21.515
It's not an alibi
for the murder.

30:21.588 --> 30:24.489
No. It just blows apart
your theory of motive,

30:24.557 --> 30:26.457
which she has neatly replaced

30:26.993 --> 30:28.859
with an alternate
theory of the crime.

30:29.430 --> 30:32.524
Dunbar's body,
fairly persuasive,

30:32.600 --> 30:34.534
unless you're saying
that she killed him, too.

30:34.969 --> 30:37.403
They're still working on
estimating the time of death.

30:37.471 --> 30:39.405
She might have been in jail
when he was killed.

30:39.473 --> 30:40.565
Oh.

30:41.308 --> 30:44.073
She has a knack for being
in two places at once.

30:44.145 --> 30:46.306
Dunbar's apartment
and the tour bus.

30:46.381 --> 30:48.110
How do you think
she pulled that off?

30:53.889 --> 30:57.018
Jamie, did the police ever talk
to anybody in Terre Haute?

31:01.731 --> 31:02.720
Well?

31:03.833 --> 31:05.858
If I could just have a few
more minutes, Your Honor.

31:05.935 --> 31:09.336
You're here. I'm here.
Miss Sullivan is here.

31:11.074 --> 31:13.838
Ah, Miss Ross.
How nice of you to join us.

31:16.546 --> 31:18.912
I gather you stayed later than 8:00 a.
M. This morning.

31:18.982 --> 31:21.883
Was the gentleman
more impressive today?

31:24.087 --> 31:25.578
Your Honor,
I've been very busy.

31:25.657 --> 31:27.124
What I'm suggesting.

31:27.225 --> 31:29.318
On a matter of business
for this court.

31:29.394 --> 31:30.986
Oh, and I thought
our business was here.

31:31.062 --> 31:32.859
Whatever kind of romp
you've been up to...

31:32.931 --> 31:36.298
Is relevant to this case, if you'd
stop focusing on my sex life.

31:36.401 --> 31:38.699
You're in contempt.
I want a check for $200.

31:38.770 --> 31:40.762
If you try to fine me...
Not now.

31:40.839 --> 31:41.828
Approach, Your Honor?

31:41.907 --> 31:43.670
If she brings her checkbook.

31:44.476 --> 31:46.034
Pretend he's your brother.

31:48.647 --> 31:49.944
Miss Ross was on an errand

31:50.015 --> 31:52.040
in connection with an urgent
motion by the People...

31:52.117 --> 31:53.881
What motion?
To amend the indictment

31:53.954 --> 31:55.512
and reopen the People's case.

31:55.588 --> 31:56.714
We're supposed
to hear closings.

31:56.790 --> 31:57.882
The defense is ready.

31:57.991 --> 32:01.222
Miss Ross has just driven in
from LaGuardia with a witness

32:01.294 --> 32:02.989
who should be heard
in support of our motion.

32:03.096 --> 32:05.564
What witness?
The defense had no notice, Your Honor.

32:05.699 --> 32:07.189
Her name is
LuAnne Walther.

32:07.267 --> 32:09.259
She's a resident of
Terre Haute, Indiana,

32:09.337 --> 32:11.965
and a former co-worker
of Lucy Sullivan.

32:12.039 --> 32:16.339
She will testify that the defendant
on trial here is not Lucy Sullivan.

32:18.245 --> 32:19.371
In my chambers.

32:19.914 --> 32:21.006
You're telling me
I've been sitting

32:21.082 --> 32:22.243
on the bench for the last month

32:22.317 --> 32:23.648
judging the wrong person?

32:23.719 --> 32:27.951
She fooled all of us.
She's Joanne Sullivan.

32:28.023 --> 32:29.183
The victim?

32:29.257 --> 32:31.316
She killed her sister
to assume her identity

32:31.393 --> 32:33.588
and escape the people
who were pursuing her.

32:33.662 --> 32:35.459
Except she happened
to be caught for the murder?

32:35.531 --> 32:36.589
Her back luck.

32:36.666 --> 32:37.758
I move for dismissal.

32:38.134 --> 32:39.726
If the People don't even
know who killed whom,

32:39.802 --> 32:41.429
I'd say reasonable doubt
is manifest.

32:41.504 --> 32:43.904
On the contrary, the evidence
against the defendant

32:43.973 --> 32:45.167
is even stronger now,

32:45.241 --> 32:46.765
if you will allow us
to reopen the case.

32:46.843 --> 32:48.174
It would be stronger.
Is that why you're trying to

32:48.244 --> 32:49.940
turn my courtroom
into a hall of mirrors?

32:50.014 --> 32:51.914
I want to put the truth
before the jury.

32:52.016 --> 32:53.711
What you can have
is a mistrial.

32:54.818 --> 32:57.514
Fine. With leave
to re-present.

32:57.921 --> 33:00.890
Excuse me.
Jeopardy has attached.

33:01.225 --> 33:02.487
A defendant can't be retried

33:02.559 --> 33:05.085
unless there's manifest
necessity for a mistrial.

33:05.296 --> 33:07.457
The only necessity here
is Mr. McCoy's ignorance

33:07.532 --> 33:08.794
of the facts of his own case.

33:08.867 --> 33:10.698
We were all ignorant
of the facts,

33:10.769 --> 33:12.259
because the defendant
withheld them.

33:12.337 --> 33:14.931
She's under no obligation
to incriminate herself.

33:15.040 --> 33:16.371
By telling us her name?

33:16.508 --> 33:17.840
Which would have
incriminated her.

33:17.910 --> 33:19.309
You just said it does.

33:19.378 --> 33:21.278
You and your
free-spirited associate

33:21.347 --> 33:23.212
have not done your homework,
Mr. McCoy.

33:23.282 --> 33:24.681
You've wasted all of our time.

33:24.917 --> 33:26.509
Your Honor...
Your motion is granted.

33:26.585 --> 33:27.779
I'm declaring a mistrial.

33:27.853 --> 33:29.650
Mr. Gillum's motion
is granted also.

33:29.955 --> 33:32.288
The murder charge is dismissed.

33:37.030 --> 33:38.361
It's outrageous.

33:39.032 --> 33:40.329
Jamie won't play
footsie with him,

33:40.400 --> 33:42.800
new facts disrupt
his perfect trial,

33:42.869 --> 33:43.995
so he takes it out on us.

33:44.371 --> 33:45.395
Right.

33:45.472 --> 33:47.634
It had nothing to do with
the fact that all this time

33:47.708 --> 33:49.573
you didn't know what you
were talking about.

33:50.144 --> 33:51.873
Dismissal of the charge
was excessive.

33:51.946 --> 33:54.244
Right. You know who's who now?
Yes.

33:54.315 --> 33:57.580
This is Joanne Sullivan
you've got there in Rikers?

33:57.652 --> 33:58.710
Who else could it be?

33:58.786 --> 33:59.775
Please don't ask.

33:59.854 --> 34:00.879
I'll re-indict.

34:00.956 --> 34:01.945
Judge Marks'll throw it out.

34:02.024 --> 34:03.013
So I'll appeal.

34:03.092 --> 34:04.923
Get the names right this time.

34:09.565 --> 34:13.969
The prohibition against double
jeopardy is not absolute.

34:15.237 --> 34:19.174
Criminal defendants are re-tried
after mistrials all the time.

34:19.375 --> 34:22.310
When the mistrials are a
matter of manifest necessity.

34:23.146 --> 34:25.739
A hung jury,
a lawyer drops dead...

34:25.815 --> 34:28.717
The trial judge thought a
mistrial was necessary here.

34:28.786 --> 34:31.219
You wanted to amend
the indictment and proceed.

34:31.288 --> 34:33.188
You didn't think
a mistrial was necessary.

34:33.257 --> 34:37.125
No. But Mr. Gillum's brief
fails to mention

34:37.194 --> 34:40.219
<i>the second prong of the standard from U.
S. V. Perez.</i>

34:40.297 --> 34:43.426
"A retrial is permitted
if the ends of public justice

34:43.502 --> 34:45.402
"would otherwise
be defeated."

34:45.469 --> 34:48.371
The public is certainly
entitled to retry a murderer

34:48.440 --> 34:51.273
when a mistrial has resulted
through no fault of the People.

34:51.342 --> 34:53.902
The People aren't at fault when
they proceed to trial misinformed?

34:53.978 --> 34:56.813
Misinformed by a professional
confidence woman

34:56.882 --> 34:59.351
who committed perjury
and a fraud upon the court.

34:59.418 --> 35:02.478
It would be repugnant to reward her.
Thank you.

35:12.432 --> 35:16.129
The public always wants to retry
people they think are murderers,

35:16.837 --> 35:19.362
but they're not allowed to throw
out the Constitution to do so.

35:19.439 --> 35:21.100
Is that what we're
being asked to do?

35:21.175 --> 35:24.076
The prohibition against double
jeopardy is paramount and...

35:24.144 --> 35:27.171
And takes up 15 pages
in your brief.

35:27.515 --> 35:28.914
What I don't see there

35:28.983 --> 35:32.077
is what position you took
regarding the mistrial.

35:32.787 --> 35:34.414
Did you oppose it?

35:34.722 --> 35:38.180
I would have, if I'd foreseen that
the People would attempt to retry.

35:38.259 --> 35:41.024
"Would have"?
Interesting.

35:43.365 --> 35:46.300
We've read your brief, sir,
and Mr. McCoy's,

35:46.368 --> 35:49.565
and unless any of my colleagues
feels differently...

35:50.806 --> 35:53.173
I don't think we've heard
anything new today.

35:54.144 --> 35:56.635
We find the People's
argument persuasive.

35:57.047 --> 35:59.015
Accordingly,
we remand this matter

35:59.082 --> 36:01.710
to part 47 for
a new trial forthwith.

36:02.719 --> 36:05.051
Given the circumstances
of the order to dismiss,

36:05.121 --> 36:08.922
I respectfully suggest that this be
reassigned through the general pool.

36:09.293 --> 36:11.352
Why reinvent the wheel,
Mr. McCoy?

36:11.429 --> 36:14.830
The original trial judge is familiar
with the facts and issues here.

36:15.366 --> 36:17.163
It might even speed things up.

36:18.836 --> 36:21.635
Where were you standing in
relation to the door, Mr. Wilkins?

36:21.707 --> 36:23.538
Move it along, Mr. McCoy.
You've made your point.

36:23.609 --> 36:25.099
I'm not quite finished,
Your Honor.

36:25.177 --> 36:26.940
He saw a woman
leave the apartment.

36:27.012 --> 36:29.446
He saw this woman,
Joanne Sullivan.

36:29.514 --> 36:31.277
Are you sure of that,
Mr. Wilkins?

36:31.750 --> 36:32.808
Pretty sure.

36:32.884 --> 36:34.112
But you only saw her
for a few seconds?

36:34.186 --> 36:35.814
That's right.
And you never identified her

36:35.888 --> 36:37.788
until the police
showed you her picture?

36:38.157 --> 36:40.091
That's right.
I see.

36:40.159 --> 36:41.990
Anything else, Mr. McCoy?

36:42.862 --> 36:43.851
Not anymore.

36:44.297 --> 36:46.356
Mr. Gillum?

36:46.432 --> 36:48.024
No questions, Your Honor.

36:49.737 --> 36:52.228
We ascertained that the New
Jersey warrant was valid

36:52.306 --> 36:53.534
and proceeded to the apartment

36:53.607 --> 36:55.131
of the defendant's husband.

36:55.209 --> 36:56.938
Was he there?
No, he wasn't.

36:57.278 --> 36:59.337
What did you do then?
Approach, Your Honor?

37:03.151 --> 37:04.618
I assume that Mr.
McCoy is heading toward

37:04.686 --> 37:06.278
the discovery of the
alleged murder weapon?

37:06.354 --> 37:07.378
Yes.
I want to object,

37:07.455 --> 37:09.446
out of the hearing of the
jury, before he mentions it.

37:09.524 --> 37:11.583
Object to what?
Anything obtained in that apartment

37:11.660 --> 37:12.786
is the fruit of
an illegal search

37:12.861 --> 37:15.159
and is inadmissible
in this trial.

37:15.230 --> 37:17.096
Your Honor,
we dealt with that issue

37:17.166 --> 37:18.793
at a hearing
before the first trial.

37:19.168 --> 37:20.157
It was resolved.

37:20.569 --> 37:21.627
Oh?

37:21.704 --> 37:22.966
Let's talk about it.

37:23.506 --> 37:26.566
This issue was decided!
It was your own ruling.

37:26.642 --> 37:28.473
Yeah. He ruled
the search was illegal.

37:28.544 --> 37:30.034
And that the evidence
was nevertheless

37:30.112 --> 37:31.512
admissible
against Miss Sullivan.

37:31.815 --> 37:33.180
Because she had no standing!

37:33.250 --> 37:35.241
That was before we knew she was
married to William Dunbar.

37:35.319 --> 37:38.015
A wife certainly has an expectation
of privacy in an apartment

37:38.121 --> 37:39.145
she shares with her husband.

37:39.222 --> 37:40.382
You had an opportunity

37:40.457 --> 37:42.550
to bring that fact to the
Court's attention then.

37:43.827 --> 37:45.728
Not without incriminating
my client,

37:45.797 --> 37:47.924
which I certainly
am not obliged to do.

37:48.399 --> 37:53.393
Anything else, Miss Ross? Mr. McCoy?
Fine. Objection is sustained.

37:54.472 --> 37:57.373
There will be no mention of
anything found in that apartment.

37:57.442 --> 38:00.310
By the way, Mr. McCoy, I never
had a chance to congratulate you

38:00.379 --> 38:02.279
on your victory
in appellate court.

38:12.257 --> 38:16.058
Detective, before our break,

38:17.931 --> 38:21.025
you testified that Mr.
Dunbar was not in his apartment?

38:21.234 --> 38:22.496
That's right.

38:22.569 --> 38:24.036
How did you ascertain that?

38:25.071 --> 38:26.766
We entered the apartment
and looked for him.

38:26.840 --> 38:31.278
And in the course of such a
search, you would routinely look

38:31.345 --> 38:33.905
anywhere a person
could be hiding?

38:34.415 --> 38:35.575
That's right.

38:36.617 --> 38:38.414
Did you open a closet door?

38:38.486 --> 38:39.578
Your Honor...

38:39.653 --> 38:40.642
Mr. McCoy...

38:42.257 --> 38:45.158
If he can re-litigate
the standing issue,

38:45.227 --> 38:47.752
I can re-litigate
the plain-sight issue.

38:47.829 --> 38:49.490
Not if I say you can't.

39:05.815 --> 39:06.804
Detective...

39:10.554 --> 39:13.250
Did you know the nature
of the murder weapon?

39:13.457 --> 39:15.288
Yes. It was
a.25 caliber pistol.

39:15.492 --> 39:18.757
And before your visit to Mr.
Dunbar's apartment,

39:19.396 --> 39:21.091
had you been looking for it?

39:21.231 --> 39:22.960
We were keeping
our eyes open, yes.

39:23.033 --> 39:24.831
How about afterwards?
Objection!

39:25.003 --> 39:26.436
Change the subject,
Mr. McCoy.

39:26.504 --> 39:28.597
The matter deserves
a hearing on the record.

39:28.673 --> 39:29.662
Not another word.

39:29.741 --> 39:31.333
With all due respect,
Your Honor,

39:31.409 --> 39:33.138
when you change
the rules of the game

39:33.211 --> 39:34.872
in the middle of a trial...
You're done, Mr. McCoy.

39:34.946 --> 39:37.677
There ought to be at least
the appearance of impartiality.

39:37.750 --> 39:40.344
Officer, place Mr. McCoy under
arrest for contempt of this court.

39:40.419 --> 39:41.750
I move for an adjournment

39:41.821 --> 39:44.415
so that the People may
appeal Your Honor's ruling.

39:44.657 --> 39:46.090
Denied. Cuff him.

40:01.508 --> 40:02.497
Your witness, Miss Ross.

40:04.644 --> 40:06.442
I'm going to need a moment
to prepare, Your Honor.

40:06.514 --> 40:09.881
Now, or I'll deem the People's
examination concluded.

40:27.736 --> 40:29.499
Nice.
Adam.

40:31.507 --> 40:35.638
Mr. Barton, Mr. Jasperson, Mr.
Montoya... Mr. Schiff.

40:36.613 --> 40:38.478
We're in a good mood,
aren't we?

40:38.548 --> 40:41.779
All except Mr. Jasperson.
He was just convicted of murder.

40:41.885 --> 40:44.183
And it was bull.
I'm gonna be getting out of here soon.

40:45.421 --> 40:48.016
Young man, sit down.

40:49.693 --> 40:51.456
I understand you
were in contempt.

40:51.862 --> 40:53.022
Just a little.

40:53.464 --> 40:54.692
Are you going to
get the transcript

40:54.765 --> 40:56.255
to the chief
administrative judge?

40:56.333 --> 40:58.699
I'm going to see Judge
Marks first, about bail.

40:59.904 --> 41:03.033
I'm okay.
But if you go, wear silk.

41:10.415 --> 41:11.814
How long has it been, Adam?

41:12.350 --> 41:15.285
I was a defense attorney.
So were you.

41:16.122 --> 41:18.181
The Ice Age.

41:18.257 --> 41:20.384
I'm letting your boy
cool his heels for a while.

41:20.459 --> 41:21.585
It's for his own good.

41:23.729 --> 41:25.526
Nathan, I read the transcript.

41:25.898 --> 41:27.559
Then you know
he was in contempt.

41:29.435 --> 41:31.131
I read the whole transcript.

41:32.773 --> 41:34.638
What were you doing, may I ask?

41:34.708 --> 41:35.697
Excuse me?

41:35.776 --> 41:40.611
Those remarks about where Miss
Ross was spending her mornings...

41:42.182 --> 41:44.947
Have you read the sexual
harassment guidelines?

41:45.353 --> 41:48.880
I wrote them, remember?
I was kidding with her.

41:49.390 --> 41:52.655
And your questions
to McCoy's witnesses?

41:53.361 --> 41:55.795
A judge of the Supreme Court
of the state of New York

41:55.863 --> 41:57.763
is entitled to
question witnesses.

41:57.832 --> 42:00.700
He's not entitled to sound
like the defense attorney

42:00.836 --> 42:03.430
or put words into
witnesses' mouths.

42:06.041 --> 42:07.508
Anything else, Adam?

42:08.043 --> 42:12.002
Yes. I'd like you to
step down from the trial.

42:16.319 --> 42:19.880
This entire meeting is an
improper ex parte approach.

42:20.957 --> 42:22.447
If you leave in
the next 10 seconds,

42:22.525 --> 42:24.288
I won't find you in contempt.

42:29.533 --> 42:32.991
The District Attorney brought this
matter to me with some reluctance.

42:33.070 --> 42:34.264
Well-deserved.

42:34.338 --> 42:35.965
I'm trying to run a trial.
I don't have time to...

42:36.040 --> 42:37.029
Make some.

42:38.009 --> 42:39.533
I'm taking this seriously.

42:39.610 --> 42:41.704
Because a young woman
can't take a joke?

42:41.780 --> 42:43.111
I'm not pressing any charge.

42:43.181 --> 42:44.443
She could.

42:45.017 --> 42:46.177
You should thank her.

42:46.251 --> 42:47.616
Fine. Thanks. Goodbye.

42:47.953 --> 42:51.116
I'm more concerned about the
general tenor of this trial.

42:51.456 --> 42:53.356
You know how
I run a trial, George.

42:53.425 --> 42:57.692
Yes. Expeditiously.
And, usually, fairly.

42:57.764 --> 42:59.095
Always fairly.

42:59.165 --> 43:01.065
You've been hostile
to the People,

43:01.868 --> 43:03.460
demeaning to
their representatives,

43:03.536 --> 43:05.060
interfering with
their witnesses...

43:05.138 --> 43:06.799
You expect me to
sit there like a lump

43:06.873 --> 43:08.637
while he springs
surprise witnesses,

43:08.809 --> 43:11.744
half-baked appeals,
revised indictments

43:11.812 --> 43:13.473
to turn my courtroom inside out

43:13.547 --> 43:15.777
to win a case he should
have lost the first time?

43:15.849 --> 43:20.309
Nathan, you're not supposed
to care who wins, remember?

43:22.791 --> 43:24.088
Your Honor,
I'd like to request...

43:24.159 --> 43:25.387
No need.

43:26.494 --> 43:30.555
Nathan, you just caught
a bad case of the flu

43:31.633 --> 43:34.431
and are unable to continue
presiding over this trial.

43:34.803 --> 43:35.827
I'm assigning Judge Bryant.

43:35.904 --> 43:36.929
George...

43:37.006 --> 43:41.238
Would you rather be sick, or be facing
the Commission on Judicial Conduct?

43:41.444 --> 43:44.004
Your Honor, it would be highly
disruptive to introduce a new judge

43:44.080 --> 43:45.342
at this stage of
the proceedings.

43:45.414 --> 43:47.177
It's your choice,
Mr. Gillum.

43:47.249 --> 43:51.152
Judge Bryant, or we start all over
again with trial number three.

43:58.829 --> 44:02.230
From his sickbed,
Judge Marks sends regrets

44:02.299 --> 44:05.167
and his thanks for your
excellent service thus far.

44:06.804 --> 44:11.537
Now, I am going to impose on you a little.
For reasons of law,

44:11.609 --> 44:13.907
with which you need not
concern yourselves,

44:14.212 --> 44:17.875
you will be hearing again from
some prosecution witnesses

44:17.949 --> 44:19.884
who have already testified,

44:19.952 --> 44:22.352
and hearing about
some new evidence,

44:22.621 --> 44:24.248
which has not been
presented to you.

44:27.426 --> 44:28.484
Man one, Jack.

44:30.529 --> 44:32.690
Sure.

44:32.765 --> 44:36.099
If you can give me a good reason
why I should accept a plea.

44:36.302 --> 44:39.601
Please try to understand.
I was terrified.

44:39.672 --> 44:41.606
So you shot your sister
in the head?

44:43.710 --> 44:45.610
People were looking for us.

44:45.912 --> 44:47.710
Billy was trying to
make enough money

44:47.782 --> 44:49.340
so that we could get away.

44:50.484 --> 44:53.180
He went out one night.
He didn't come back.

44:53.687 --> 44:55.154
I knew they'd killed him.

44:57.958 --> 44:59.755
I loved him so much.

45:01.630 --> 45:03.655
I couldn't go to the police.

45:03.732 --> 45:07.566
They were still looking for me.
I didn't want to die.

45:10.138 --> 45:15.634
So you took your sister's life instead.
No deal, Stan.

45:23.519 --> 45:25.749
My sister's life,
Mr. McCoy?

45:28.257 --> 45:31.193
My sister lived in
Terre Haute, Indiana.

45:32.396 --> 45:35.729
She stapled papers in
an insurance office.

45:37.734 --> 45:40.897
My sister didn't have a life.

45:50.081 --> 45:52.345
Jury was back in 20 minutes.
Guilty, Adam.

45:52.417 --> 45:54.442
She's going away,
despite Judge Marks.

45:55.153 --> 45:56.381
That's good.

45:57.423 --> 45:59.550
What's the matter?
Your leg acting up?

46:00.292 --> 46:02.351
When Nathan Marks
became a judge,

46:02.862 --> 46:05.330
most of his colleagues
cared only about

46:05.397 --> 46:08.389
getting re-elected
and getting Fridays off.

46:09.802 --> 46:12.033
Marks made himself
a royal pain.

46:13.039 --> 46:14.631
He cared mostly about justice.

46:14.708 --> 46:16.573
It went to his head, Adam.

46:17.043 --> 46:18.442
He brought himself down.

46:18.511 --> 46:22.277
Yeah. Pardon me if
I don't celebrate.
