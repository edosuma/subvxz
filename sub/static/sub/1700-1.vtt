00:49.966 --> 00:52.760
There's nothing to tell.
It's just some guy I work with.

00:52.969 --> 00:55.137
Come on.
You're going out with a guy.

00:55.305 --> 00:57.848
There's gotta be something
wrong with him.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.933
So does he have a hump
and a hair piece?

01:02.395 --> 01:03.771
Wait. Does he eat chalk?

01:05.022 --> 01:08.233
I don't want her to go through
what I went through with Carl. Oh.

01:08.443 --> 01:11.236
Okay, everybody relax.
This is not even a date.

01:11.446 --> 01:14.406
It's just two people going out
to dinner and not having sex.

01:14.616 --> 01:16.158
Sounds like a date to me.

01:19.037 --> 01:21.872
I'm back in high school,
in the middle of the cafeteria...

01:22.082 --> 01:25.417
...and I realize I'm totally naked.

01:25.627 --> 01:27.169
- Oh, yeah.
- I've had that dream.

01:27.378 --> 01:31.465
Then I look down and I realize
there is a phone...

01:32.050 --> 01:34.009
...there.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.845
- Instead of...
- That's right!

01:37.055 --> 01:38.555
- That one, I've never had.
- No.

01:38.723 --> 01:42.851
All of a sudden,
the phone starts to ring.

01:43.061 --> 01:44.812
And it turns out it's my mother.

01:46.564 --> 01:50.859
Which is very, very weird
because she never calls me.

01:55.865 --> 01:57.783
Hi.

01:58.785 --> 02:01.954
This guy says "hello,"
I wanna kill myself.

02:02.247 --> 02:03.413
Are you okay, sweetie?

02:03.665 --> 02:08.335
I feel like someone grabbed my small
intestine, pulled it out of my mouth...

02:08.502 --> 02:11.380
...and tied it around my neck.
- Cookie?

02:13.383 --> 02:14.883
Carol moved her stuff out today.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.135
Oh.

02:16.302 --> 02:18.095
- Let me get you some coffee.
- Thanks.

02:21.057 --> 02:22.808
Ew. Unh.

02:22.976 --> 02:26.937
No. No, don't!
Stop cleansing my aura.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.773
Just leave my aura alone, okay?

02:31.776 --> 02:34.653
I'll be fine. All right? Really.
I hope she'll be very happy.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.155
- No, you don't.
- No, I don't.

02:36.322 --> 02:38.157
To hell with her. She left me!

02:39.200 --> 02:41.160
And you never knew she was a lesbian.

02:45.206 --> 02:47.374
No! Okay?

02:47.542 --> 02:50.335
Why does everyone
keep fixating on that?

02:51.963 --> 02:54.756
She didn't know. How should I know?

02:56.593 --> 02:59.261
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.890
Did I say that out loud?

03:04.809 --> 03:08.896
All right, Ross. Look, you're feeling
a lot of pain right now.

03:09.063 --> 03:11.481
You're angry. You're hurting.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.942
Can I tell you what the answer is?

03:14.152 --> 03:15.444
Strip joints!

03:17.614 --> 03:19.948
Come on, you're single.
Have some hormones.

03:20.158 --> 03:22.451
See, but I don't want
to be single, okay?

03:22.660 --> 03:25.829
I just wanna be married again.

03:29.959 --> 03:33.086
And I just want a million dollars!

03:34.214 --> 03:35.297
Rachel?

03:35.465 --> 03:38.175
Oh, God, Monica! Hi! Thank God!

03:38.343 --> 03:41.511
I went to your building and
this guy with a hammer said...

03:41.679 --> 03:43.889
...that you might be here, and you are.

03:44.140 --> 03:47.643
- Can I get you some coffee?
- Decaf.

03:48.228 --> 03:52.189
Okay, everybody, this is Rachel,
another Lincoln High survivor.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.900
This is everybody.
This is Chandler and Phoebe...

03:55.109 --> 03:57.361
...and Joey. And remember
my brother, Ross?

03:57.528 --> 03:58.654
- Sure!
- Hey.

03:58.821 --> 04:00.739
- Hi.
- Oh, God.

04:08.539 --> 04:12.125
So you wanna tell us now, or are we
waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

04:14.379 --> 04:19.341
Oh, God! Well, it started about
a half-hour before the wedding.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.927
I was in this room
with all the presents...

04:22.095 --> 04:23.929
...and I was looking
at this gravy boat.

04:24.138 --> 04:27.557
This really gorgeous
Limoges gravy boat.

04:27.725 --> 04:29.559
When all of a sudden...
Sweet 'N Low?

04:29.727 --> 04:31.853
- I realized...

04:32.021 --> 04:35.941
...I was more turned on by
this gravy boat than by Barry.

04:36.109 --> 04:39.152
Then I got really freaked out,
and that's when it hit me:

04:39.320 --> 04:42.114
How much Barry looks
like Mr. Potato Head.

04:42.532 --> 04:45.784
You know, I mean, I always knew
he looked familiar, but...

04:47.954 --> 04:51.290
Anyway, I just had to get out of there,
and I started wondering:

04:51.541 --> 04:55.127
"Why am I doing this?"
And "Who am I doing this for?"

04:55.295 --> 04:59.673
Anyway, I just didn't know where to go,
and I know you and I have drifted apart...

04:59.882 --> 05:02.718
...but you're the only person
I know in the city.

05:02.927 --> 05:04.594
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.889
Oh, I was kind of hoping that
wouldn't be an issue.

05:22.071 --> 05:24.573
I'm guessing he bought her
the big pipe organ...

05:24.741 --> 05:27.200
...and she's really not
happy about it.

05:28.453 --> 05:31.496
Daddy, I just... I can't marry him.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.332
I'm sorry.

05:33.499 --> 05:36.376
I just don't love him.

05:36.836 --> 05:39.504
Well, it matters to me.

05:42.008 --> 05:44.384
She should not be wearing those pants.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.554
I say push her down the stairs.

05:47.764 --> 05:50.974
Push her down the stairs!
Push her down the stairs!

05:55.229 --> 05:57.230
Come on, Daddy, listen to me!

05:57.440 --> 06:01.985
It's like all of my life, everyone's
always told me, "You're a shoe!

06:02.153 --> 06:04.237
You're a shoe! You're a shoe!
You're a shoe!"

06:04.447 --> 06:07.616
Then today I stopped and said,
"What if I don't wanna be a shoe?

06:07.825 --> 06:10.994
What if I wanna be a purse?
You know?

06:11.162 --> 06:12.954
Or a hat?"

06:13.873 --> 06:16.416
I don't want you to buy me a hat,
I am a hat.

06:16.584 --> 06:18.794
It's a metaphor, Daddy!

06:20.546 --> 06:22.381
You can see where he'd have trouble.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.511
Look, Daddy, it's my life.

06:28.846 --> 06:31.306
Well, maybe I'll just stay
here with Monica.

06:34.310 --> 06:36.812
I guess we've established
she's staying with Monica.

06:38.898 --> 06:41.691
Well, maybe that's my decision.

06:42.276 --> 06:44.528
Well, maybe I don't need your money.

06:44.695 --> 06:46.947
Wait! Wait! I said maybe!

06:53.913 --> 06:56.123
Okay. Just breathe, that's it.

06:56.332 --> 06:58.792
Just try to think of nice, calm things.

06:59.001 --> 07:02.879
Raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens

07:03.256 --> 07:07.217
Doorbells and sleigh bells
And something with mittens

07:07.969 --> 07:11.346
La la la something
With string

07:11.514 --> 07:13.390
I'm all better now.

07:15.184 --> 07:17.185
I helped.

07:18.855 --> 07:21.189
Look, this is probably
for the best, you know?

07:21.524 --> 07:24.067
Independence. Taking control of your life.

07:24.277 --> 07:28.613
And, hey, if you need anything,
you can always come to Joey.

07:28.781 --> 07:32.200
Me and Chandler live right
across the hall. And he's away a lot.

07:34.078 --> 07:36.621
Joey, stop hitting on her.
It's her wedding day.

07:36.831 --> 07:38.790
What? Like there's a rule or something?

07:41.335 --> 07:44.880
Please don't do that again.
It's a horrible sound.

07:45.047 --> 07:47.466
- Uh, it's Paul.
- Buzz him in.

07:47.758 --> 07:50.051
- Who's Paul?
- Paul, the wine guy, Paul?

07:50.261 --> 07:51.303
Maybe.

07:51.512 --> 07:54.806
Wait a minute. Your "not a real date"
is with Paul, the wine guy?

07:55.016 --> 07:56.808
- He finally asked you out?
- Yes.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.768
Ooh. This is a "Dear Diary" moment.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.813
Rach, wait, I can cancel.

08:02.064 --> 08:03.857
Please, no. Go, I'll be fine.

08:04.025 --> 08:07.736
Ross, are you okay?
I mean, do you want me to stay?

08:08.613 --> 08:10.739
That'd be good.

08:11.115 --> 08:14.868
- Really?
- No, go on! It's Paul, the wine guy.

08:18.706 --> 08:21.124
Hi, come in. Paul, this is...

08:22.001 --> 08:24.544
...everybody. Everybody, this is Paul.

08:25.004 --> 08:26.046
Paul, the wine guy.

08:26.255 --> 08:30.091
- Wine guy.
- I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?

08:30.510 --> 08:33.053
- Okay. Sit down. Two seconds.
- Okay.

08:37.225 --> 08:40.309
Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes.
That can't be good.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.731
So, Rachel,
what are you up to tonight?

08:45.274 --> 08:49.110
Well, I was supposed to be headed
for Aruba on my honeymoon...

08:49.278 --> 08:50.320
...so, nothing.

08:52.740 --> 08:54.950
Right. You're not even
getting your honeymoon.

08:55.243 --> 08:59.204
God. No, no. Although, Aruba. Heh.
This time of year? Eh.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.957
Talk about your...

09:02.124 --> 09:03.166
...big lizards.

09:07.964 --> 09:10.674
Anyway, if you don't feel
like being alone tonight...

09:10.883 --> 09:13.718
...Joey and Chandler are
helping me with my furniture.

09:13.886 --> 09:17.055
Yes, and we're very excited about it.

09:17.223 --> 09:20.559
Actually, thanks, but I'm just gonna
hang out here tonight.

09:20.726 --> 09:22.769
- It's been a long day.
- Oh, sure. Okay. Sure.

09:22.937 --> 09:24.271
Hey, Pheebs, you wanna help?

09:24.689 --> 09:26.648
Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.

09:34.865 --> 09:39.286
I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y
thing to the side things...

09:39.453 --> 09:42.247
...using a bunch of these
little worm guys.

09:43.416 --> 09:48.169
I have no bracket-y thing,
I see no worm guys whatsoever...

09:48.337 --> 09:51.423
...and I cannot feel my legs.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.050
What's this?

09:54.260 --> 09:57.262
I have no idea.

09:59.140 --> 10:01.558
- Done with the bookcase.
- All finished.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.938
This was Carol's favorite beer.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.693
She always drank it out of the can.
I should have known.

10:11.861 --> 10:15.071
Hey. Ross, let me ask you a question.

10:15.239 --> 10:19.451
She got the furniture,
the stereo, the good TV.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.660
What did you get?

10:20.995 --> 10:22.037
You guys.

10:22.204 --> 10:24.289
- Oh, God. Oh, my God.
- You got screwed.

10:24.498 --> 10:28.793
- Oh, my God.
- I know, I know. I'm such an idiot.

10:29.337 --> 10:33.882
I should've caught on when she went to
the dentist four and five times a week.

10:34.050 --> 10:36.259
I mean, how clean can teeth get?

10:36.427 --> 10:38.845
My brother's going through that.
He's such a mess.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.680
How did you get through it?

10:40.890 --> 10:44.392
He might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.144
- Say her...
- Leg?

10:46.312 --> 10:48.229
Heh. That's one way of going through it,
yeah.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.315
Me, I went for the watch.

10:50.775 --> 10:52.651
- You actually broke her watch?
- Mm.

10:53.277 --> 10:56.363
Barry, I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

10:56.614 --> 11:01.534
You probably think it's about making
love with your socks on, but it isn't.

11:01.702 --> 11:04.537
It isn't, it's about me. And I...

11:11.587 --> 11:14.631
Hi. Machine cut me off again.
Anyway...

11:16.425 --> 11:20.512
You know what's scary? What if
there's only one woman for everybody?

11:20.721 --> 11:24.057
I mean, what if you get one
woman, and that's it?

11:24.225 --> 11:29.104
Unfortunately, in my case,
there was only one woman for her.

11:29.563 --> 11:32.816
What are you talking about?
One woman.

11:33.401 --> 11:37.028
That's like saying there's only
one flavor of ice cream for you.

11:37.196 --> 11:40.949
Let me tell you something, Ross.
There's lots of flavors out there.

11:41.117 --> 11:45.578
There's rocky road and cookie dough
and bing cherry vanilla.

11:46.205 --> 11:50.709
You can get them with jimmies
or nuts or whipped cream.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.628
This is the best thing that
ever happened to you.

11:53.796 --> 11:56.673
You got married. You were like, what, 8?

11:58.634 --> 12:02.637
Welcome back to the world. Grab a spoon.

12:02.805 --> 12:05.348
I honestly don't know
if I'm hungry or horny.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.183
Then stay out of my freezer.

12:10.938 --> 12:14.357
Ever since she walked out on me, I...

12:14.692 --> 12:16.651
What? What?

12:16.819 --> 12:18.653
You wanna spell it out with noodles?

12:18.863 --> 12:22.449
No, it's more of a fifth date
kind of revelation.

12:23.242 --> 12:26.286
Oh, so there's gonna be a fifth date?

12:27.830 --> 12:29.497
Isn't there?

12:29.707 --> 12:31.875
Yeah, yeah. I think there is.

12:33.711 --> 12:35.420
What were you gonna say?

12:37.047 --> 12:39.174
Well... Er, uh...

12:40.342 --> 12:42.552
Ever since she left me, um...

12:43.679 --> 12:46.973
...I haven't been able to perform...

12:47.224 --> 12:48.433
...sexually.

12:51.312 --> 12:52.812
Oh, God! Oh, God! I am so...

12:53.022 --> 12:54.230
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.859
Being spit on is probably
not what you need right now.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.736
Um...

13:00.112 --> 13:01.196
How long?

13:01.739 --> 13:02.822
Two years.

13:03.574 --> 13:05.283
Wow!

13:05.451 --> 13:08.411
I'm glad you smashed her watch.

13:10.372 --> 13:13.792
So you still think you might
want that fifth date?

13:16.796 --> 13:18.338
Yeah.

13:18.506 --> 13:20.340
Yeah, I do.

13:21.550 --> 13:24.886
I, Joanie, take you, Charles,
as my lawful husband.

13:25.221 --> 13:28.473
- Do you take Joanie...?
- Oh! See.

13:28.641 --> 13:33.853
But Joanie loved Chachi.
That's the difference.

13:35.397 --> 13:36.773
"Grab a spoon."

13:37.107 --> 13:39.609
Do you know long it's been
since I grabbed a spoon?

13:40.110 --> 13:42.946
Do the words, "Billy, don't be
a hero," mean anything to you?

13:45.199 --> 13:49.702
You know, here's the thing.
Even if I could get it together enough...

13:49.870 --> 13:52.413
...to ask a woman out...

13:52.873 --> 13:55.291
...who am I gonna ask?

14:16.605 --> 14:17.981
Isn't this amazing?

14:18.148 --> 14:20.483
I mean, I have never made coffee
before in my life.

14:20.651 --> 14:23.152
- That is amazing.
- Congratulations.

14:23.362 --> 14:28.074
While you're on a roll, if you feel like you
gotta make a Western omelet or something...

14:30.995 --> 14:34.455
Although, actually I'm really
not that hungry this morning.

14:35.374 --> 14:36.708
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.501
- Morning.
- Morning.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.588
- Morning.
- Morning, Paul.

14:41.755 --> 14:44.966
- Hello, Paul.
- Hi. Paul, is it?

14:49.096 --> 14:51.848
I had a really great time last night.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.892
Thank you. Thank you so much.

14:54.602 --> 14:57.478
- We'll talk later, okay?
- Yeah.

15:02.151 --> 15:03.985
Thank you.

15:09.825 --> 15:12.619
That wasn't a real date.

15:13.329 --> 15:16.164
What the hell do you do
on a real date?

15:17.041 --> 15:20.501
- Shut up and put my table back.
- Okay.

15:20.669 --> 15:22.545
All right, kids, I gotta get to work.

15:22.755 --> 15:28.259
If I don't input those numbers,
it doesn't make much of a difference.

15:31.305 --> 15:33.431
So, like, you guys all have jobs?

15:34.224 --> 15:35.892
Yeah, we all have jobs.

15:36.101 --> 15:38.728
See, that's how we buy stuff.

15:40.356 --> 15:41.648
Yeah, I'm an actor.

15:41.857 --> 15:44.067
Wow. Would I have seen you in anything?

15:44.276 --> 15:46.611
Oh, I doubt it. Mostly regional work.

15:46.820 --> 15:50.406
Unless you happened to catch the
Wee One's production of Pinocchio.

15:50.658 --> 15:53.201
"Look, Geppeto. I'm a real live boy."

15:56.038 --> 15:57.747
I will not take this abuse.

15:57.998 --> 15:59.916
You're right. I'm sorry.

16:00.334 --> 16:03.044
Once I was a wooden boy
A little wooden boy

16:07.132 --> 16:09.467
So how are you doing today?
Did you sleep okay?

16:09.677 --> 16:13.012
Did you talk to Barry?
I can't stop smiling.

16:13.806 --> 16:17.684
I can see that. You look like you
slept with a hanger in your mouth.

16:22.940 --> 16:26.401
I know. He's just so...

16:26.568 --> 16:28.111
Remember you and Tony De Marco?

16:28.320 --> 16:32.323
- Oh, yeah.
- Well, it's like that. With feelings.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.867
Oh, wow, are you in trouble!

16:35.536 --> 16:39.330
Okay, okay. I am just going to get up,
go to work...

16:39.498 --> 16:42.208
...and not think about him all day.

16:42.376 --> 16:45.336
Or else I'm just gonna
get up and go to work.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.130
- Oh, wish me luck!
- What for?

16:47.339 --> 16:50.633
I'm gonna go get one
of those job things.

16:58.600 --> 17:01.227
- Hey, Monica.
- Hey, Franny. Welcome back.

17:01.395 --> 17:02.895
How was Florida?

17:03.063 --> 17:04.396
You had sex, didn't you?

17:06.275 --> 17:07.316
How do you do that?

17:08.444 --> 17:12.238
- So, who?
- You know Paul?

17:12.781 --> 17:14.365
Paul, the wine guy?

17:14.532 --> 17:16.117
Oh, yeah, I know Paul.

17:18.662 --> 17:21.164
You mean, you know Paul
like I know Paul?

17:21.373 --> 17:23.665
Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul.

17:23.834 --> 17:27.962
Before me, there was no snap
in his turtle for two years.

17:31.216 --> 17:33.760
Of course it was a line.

17:34.178 --> 17:36.846
Why? Why would anybody
do something like that?

17:37.056 --> 17:40.308
We're looking for an answer
more sophisticated than:

17:40.476 --> 17:42.393
"To get you into bed."

17:43.353 --> 17:45.021
Is it me?

17:45.189 --> 17:48.733
Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs...

17:48.901 --> 17:51.527
...and men with severe emotional
problems can hear?

17:51.737 --> 17:53.654
All right, come here. Give me your feet.

18:01.163 --> 18:02.997
I just thought he was nice, you know?

18:05.876 --> 18:08.336
I can't believe you
didn't know it was a line.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.258
Guess what.

18:14.426 --> 18:16.219
- You got a job?
- Are you kidding?

18:16.386 --> 18:18.054
I'm trained for nothing.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.933
I was laughed out of 12 interviews today.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.643
Yet you're surprisingly upbeat.

18:23.852 --> 18:27.355
Well, you would be too if you found
Joan and David boots on sale...

18:27.523 --> 18:29.273
...50 percent off.

18:29.483 --> 18:31.275
Oh, how well you know me.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.363
They're my new "I don't need
a job or my parents.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.782
I've got great boots" boots.

18:39.159 --> 18:41.369
- How'd you pay for them?
- Uh, credit card.

18:41.912 --> 18:43.579
And who pays for that?

18:44.248 --> 18:46.332
Um, my father.

18:48.919 --> 18:51.087
You can't live off your parents
your whole life.

18:51.296 --> 18:54.966
I know that. That's why
I was getting married.

18:55.342 --> 18:58.344
Give her a break. It's hard being
on your own for the first time.

18:58.512 --> 19:00.012
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

19:00.180 --> 19:02.890
I remember when I first came
to this city, I was 14.

19:03.058 --> 19:05.935
My mom had killed herself
and my stepdad was back in prison.

19:06.103 --> 19:08.146
And I got here,
and I didn't know anybody.

19:08.313 --> 19:11.691
I ended up living with this albino
guy who was cleaning windshields...

19:11.859 --> 19:15.653
...outside Port Authority.
And then he killed himself.

19:16.405 --> 19:20.241
And then I found aromatherapy.
So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.

19:24.371 --> 19:27.123
The word you're looking for is:

19:27.708 --> 19:28.958
"Anyway..."

19:33.130 --> 19:34.255
All right. You ready?

19:34.423 --> 19:36.132
- I don't think so.
- Oh, come on.

19:36.466 --> 19:37.884
Cut. Cut.

19:38.093 --> 19:41.053
Cut, cut, cut.

19:42.681 --> 19:45.600
- Hey.
- All right.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.560
Welcome to the real world.

19:47.769 --> 19:50.521
It sucks. You're gonna love it.

19:57.446 --> 20:00.781
Well, that's it.
You gonna crash on the couch?

20:00.991 --> 20:04.327
- No. No, I gotta go home sometime.
- Are you gonna be okay?

20:04.494 --> 20:05.995
Yeah.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.915
Look what I just found on the floor.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.460
What?

20:12.920 --> 20:14.420
That's Paul's watch.

20:14.588 --> 20:16.672
You can just put it back
where you found it.

20:18.300 --> 20:21.761
Oh, boy. All right.
Good night, everybody.

20:21.929 --> 20:22.970
Good night.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.147
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

20:34.274 --> 20:35.524
- Oh, sorry.
- No. Oh, no. Go.

20:35.692 --> 20:37.652
- No, have it, really.
- Split it?

20:37.819 --> 20:39.820
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:41.740 --> 20:42.782
Thanks.

20:43.492 --> 20:47.078
You probably didn't know this,
but back in high school I had...

20:47.246 --> 20:49.080
...a major crush on you.

20:50.540 --> 20:51.707
I knew.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.335
You did? Oh.

20:55.128 --> 20:58.130
I figured you thought I was
Monica's geeky older brother.

20:58.882 --> 21:00.883
- I did.
- Oh.

21:05.514 --> 21:07.348
Listen, do you think...

21:07.516 --> 21:11.018
And try not to let my vulnerability
become any kind of a factor here.

21:13.105 --> 21:16.983
Do you think it would be okay if
I ask you out sometime, maybe?

21:18.235 --> 21:20.069
Yeah.

21:20.529 --> 21:21.821
Maybe.

21:22.823 --> 21:24.657
Okay.

21:29.413 --> 21:31.872
Okay, maybe I will.

21:35.836 --> 21:37.962
- Good night.
- Good night.

21:51.518 --> 21:53.227
See you.

21:53.729 --> 21:54.770
Mm-hm.

21:54.938 --> 21:57.356
Wait, wait. Hey, what's with you?

21:59.651 --> 22:02.320
I just grabbed a spoon.

22:10.495 --> 22:11.954
Can't believe what I'm hearing.

22:12.205 --> 22:13.873
I can't believe
What I'm hearing here

22:14.041 --> 22:16.250
- What? I said you had...
- What? I said you had...

22:17.294 --> 22:19.754
- Would you stop?
- Oh, was I doing it again?

22:19.963 --> 22:21.797
Yes.

22:22.841 --> 22:24.842
Would anybody like more coffee?

22:26.720 --> 22:29.180
Did you make it or are you just serving it?

22:29.348 --> 22:32.641
- I'm just serving it.
- I'll have a cup of coffee.

22:33.101 --> 22:34.352
Kids, new dream.

22:35.103 --> 22:38.439
I'm in Las Vegas. I'm Liza Minnelli.
