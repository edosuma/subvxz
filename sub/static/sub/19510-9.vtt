IT'S OK. I GET IT. I DO.

21:21.911 --> 21:25.014
BASTARD! I WILL CUT YOU!

21:25.415 --> 21:29.619
OK. I SHOULD PROBABLY
GET BACK TO MY MEETING.

21:30.860 --> 21:33.623
[YELLING, FIGHTING]

21:34.764 --> 21:35.064
[BEEP]

21:35.064 --> 21:37.066
OH, YOU GOT ANOTHER IM
FROM SAM'S DAD.

21:37.066 --> 21:37.767
AGAIN?

21:37.767 --> 21:40.600
SAYS, WHY YOU HAVEN'T SIGNED UP
FOR HIS FANTASY HOCKEY LEAGUE?

21:40.600 --> 21:41.871
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHY DON'T YOU TELL HIM

21:41.871 --> 21:45.034
I ONLY HAVE TIME
TO SERVICE ONE FANTASY--
HIS WIFE.

21:45.034 --> 21:46.936
I'M GONNA LET YOU
TELL HIM THAT.

21:46.936 --> 21:47.837
HI, BEN.

21:47.837 --> 21:51.581
GET INTO THE TRAINING
ROOM. MOVE, MOVE, MOVE!

21:51.581 --> 21:52.682
I WANT TO TALK TO BEN.

21:52.682 --> 21:53.943
WELL, YOU DON'T GET
TO TALK TO BEN.

21:53.943 --> 21:54.884
ALL RIGHT. HE'S FRAGILE.

21:54.884 --> 21:57.547
WANT TO SEND HIM A MESSAGE.
IT GOES THROUGH ME.

21:57.547 --> 22:00.550
GET! GET!

22:00.550 --> 22:01.721
OK...

22:01.721 --> 22:03.493
[SOFTLY]
WELL, I JUST WANTED
TO SAY THAT...

22:03.493 --> 22:07.697
[LOUDLY]
I FEEL TERRIBLE ABOUT THE WAY
THAT I'VE BEEN ACTING.

22:07.697 --> 22:09.499
YOU MEAN LIKE A GIRL
WHO EATS CARS?

22:09.499 --> 22:12.932
I'M NOT GONNA
TRY TO MAKE ANY EXCUSES HERE.

22:12.932 --> 22:14.564
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE I USED
NO SELF-CONTROL.

22:14.564 --> 22:17.837
I MEAN, YOUR HEAD DIDN'T
END UP ON A PIKE, RIGHT?

22:17.837 --> 22:19.969
IF THAT'S ALL...

22:20.610 --> 22:21.641
THANK YOU.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.873
LOOK, I'M JUST
TRYING TO APOLOGIZE HERE.

22:23.873 --> 22:25.044
DO YOU HAVE TO BE SO RUDE?

22:25.044 --> 22:28.778
OMG. MAYBE YOU DIDN'T HEAR
IT THE FIRST TIME.

22:28.778 --> 22:29.819
OR THE TENTH TIME.

22:29.819 --> 22:30.980
YOU AND BEN ARE OVER.

22:30.980 --> 22:33.783
LOOK AT ME
WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU.
BEN!

22:33.783 --> 22:36.956
I WANT TO TALK DIRECTLY TO BEN.

22:36.956 --> 22:39.028
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
I'M SORRY.

22:39.028 --> 22:43.032
ARE YOU STANDING IN THE WAY
OF OUR RELATIONSHIP?

22:43.032 --> 22:47.967
NO, I'M STANDING IN THE WAY
OF YOUR CRAZINESS.

23:03.653 --> 23:07.016
SO HE GROUNDED HIS PLANE
IN VEGAS?

23:07.016 --> 23:11.861
YEP. AND ALAN'S SECRETS WENT
BACK TO HELL WITH HIM.

23:11.861 --> 23:14.023
WOW. THAT IS BRILLIANT.

23:14.023 --> 23:17.967
YOU ARE UP AGAINST
AN EVIL GENIUS.

23:18.798 --> 23:20.870
IF YOU KEEP FILLING MY GLASS
WITH MORE WINE,

23:20.870 --> 23:26.005
I MIGHT START BLABBING
SOME DEVIL SECRETS OF MY OWN.

23:26.005 --> 23:29.078
GOD KNOWS I'M
SITTING ON SOME DOOZIES.

23:30.940 --> 23:33.513
I'M HAVING SUCH
A WONDERFUL TIME, SAM.

23:33.513 --> 23:37.146
IT'S BEEN SUCH A LONG TIME
SINCE I'VE BEEN
OUT ON A DATE.

23:37.146 --> 23:40.049
REALLY?

23:40.049 --> 23:41.721
WHAT ABOUT YOU, SAM?

23:41.721 --> 23:45.925
IS THERE ANYONE SPECIAL
IN YOUR LIFE?

23:45.925 --> 23:49.829
NOPE. NOBODY IN MY LIFE.

23:59.839 --> 24:01.010
WHAT?

24:01.010 --> 24:03.643
I LIED.

24:03.643 --> 24:08.478
THERE IS SOMEBODY.
HER NAME IS ANDI.

24:08.478 --> 24:10.079
OH.

24:10.079 --> 24:10.680
YEAH.

24:10.680 --> 24:13.923
WELL, IF YOU'VE GOT
A GIRLFRIEND WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE WITH ME THEN?

24:13.923 --> 24:18.488
BECAUSE WE CAN'T BE
TOGETHER. IT'S--IT'S
REALLY COMPLICATED.

24:18.488 --> 24:23.462
I'M SORRY--I'M SORRY
FOR MISLEADING YOU.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.965
DON'T BE.

24:25.965 --> 24:30.740
I ADMIRE YOUR HONESTY, SAM.

24:30.740 --> 24:32.842
SO HERE WE ARE
AT A CROSSROADS.

24:32.842 --> 24:34.544
DO WE CALL IT A NIGHT?

24:34.544 --> 24:40.510
OR DO WE PRESS AHEAD
AND SEE WHERE THINGS LEAD?

24:40.510 --> 24:41.951
HOW DOES THAT SONG GO?

24:41.951 --> 24:46.115
IF YOU CAN'T BE
WITH YOUR TRUE LOVE--

24:46.115 --> 24:46.986
NO...

24:46.986 --> 24:49.689
THE LYRIC IS "IF YOU CAN'T BE
WITH THE ONE YOU LOVE.

24:49.689 --> 24:52.722
HONEY, LOVE THE ONE
YOU'RE WITH."

24:52.722 --> 24:53.663
I SHOULD KNOW. I WROTE IT.

24:53.663 --> 24:56.566
OR AT LEAST I PROVIDED
THE WEED THAT PROVIDED

24:56.566 --> 24:58.227
THE TRYST THAT PROVIDED
THE INSPIRATION.

24:58.227 --> 24:59.899
THIS ISN'T
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

24:59.899 --> 25:01.801
I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU.

25:01.801 --> 25:04.203
AND YOU! YOU'RE A TEACHER!

25:04.203 --> 25:06.706
HE'S YOUR STUDENT
FOR GOODNESS SAKE!

25:06.706 --> 25:09.539
DOES YOUR PERVERTED LIBIDO
KNOW NO LIMITS?

25:09.539 --> 25:13.012
YOU'RE INSANE!
YOU'RE ACTUALLY INSANE!

25:13.012 --> 25:17.917
AND I DON'T EVER WANT
TO BE WITH YOU--EVER!

25:17.917 --> 25:20.049
AHH.

25:20.620 --> 25:22.952
I'LL DEAL WITH YOU LATER.

25:42.912 --> 25:45.074
OH, THERE YOU ARE.

25:45.074 --> 25:47.276
HI, SOCK.

25:47.276 --> 25:50.580
AAH! AAH!

25:50.580 --> 25:54.053
BEN'S NOT HERE.
BEN'S WORKING
A MIDNIGHT SHIFT.

25:54.053 --> 25:58.057
SO I'LL THANK YOU TO HAUL
YOUR STALKY-ASS OUTTA HERE.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.890
I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO BEN.
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

26:00.890 --> 26:03.262
WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO YOU.

26:03.262 --> 26:08.668
SO, COME ON. SLIP IT OUT.
SLIP IT QUICK.

26:08.668 --> 26:10.169
MMM.

26:10.169 --> 26:14.103
OH, WOULD YOU DROP THIS
AT THE CURB. THANK YOU.

26:14.103 --> 26:15.104
MAY BE SOME RECYCLABLES
IN THERE.

26:15.104 --> 26:20.980
SO WOULD YOU BE A DOLL
AND SEPARATE THE PLASTICS?
GOOD TIMES! LATER.

26:21.350 --> 26:24.914
[GROAN]

26:24.914 --> 26:26.656
MMM.

26:27.817 --> 26:28.057
HA HA.

26:28.057 --> 26:33.963
HA. THAT'S A GOOD LITTLE TRICK.
REALLY SPOOKY. I'M SO SCARED.

26:33.963 --> 26:35.725
TOO BAD IT'S POINTLESS.

26:35.725 --> 26:36.866
YOU CAN STAND THERE
STARING AT ME ALL NIGHT,

26:36.866 --> 26:40.199
TURN INTO A BIG ACID DROOLING
MONSTER. I DON'T CARE.

26:40.199 --> 26:43.973
BECAUSE QUALITY SLEEP,
LITTLE LADY, COMES FIRST.

26:43.973 --> 26:46.636
12 HOURS A NIGHT.
5 HOURS A DAY.

26:46.636 --> 26:49.709
SOCK, I'M NOT HERE
TO SCARE YOU.

26:49.709 --> 26:50.379
OH, REALLY?

26:50.379 --> 26:53.342
I NEED TO SEE BEN.
SOCK, I NEED SEE HIM.

26:53.342 --> 26:56.315
AND I NEED TO TELL HIM
HOW SORRY I AM.

26:56.315 --> 26:59.018
AND WELL, FRANKLY
YOU'RE JUST--

26:59.018 --> 27:02.091
YOU'RE STANDING IN
THE WAY OF THAT.

27:02.952 --> 27:05.995
I WOULD DO--NO--

27:05.995 --> 27:09.929
ANYTHING TO HAVE BEN BACK.

27:09.929 --> 27:11.630
HA HA.

27:19.238 --> 27:20.910
WHOA!

27:21.340 --> 27:23.642
THE QUESTION IS

27:23.642 --> 27:26.746
WHAT WOULD YOU NOT DO
TO PROTECT HIM?

27:26.746 --> 27:29.348
OK. WHOA. WHOA.

27:29.348 --> 27:30.349
OK. LET ME JUST CLEAR THIS UP.

27:30.349 --> 27:35.224
YOU'RE THINKING YOU
CAN DEMON-BANG YOUR WAY
THROUGH ME TO GET TO BEN?

27:35.224 --> 27:38.057
WELL, I THOUGHT ABOUT
BRINGING A FRIEND.

27:38.057 --> 27:41.360
BUT I WASN'T REALLY SURE
IF YOU LIKE GIRLS OR GUYS.

27:41.360 --> 27:44.663
THAT... WHAT? I LIKE GIRLS.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

27:44.663 --> 27:45.695
GET OUT OF HERE.

27:45.695 --> 27:47.136
OK WELL, I JUST THOUGHT--

27:47.136 --> 27:49.098
YOU JUST THOUGHT?
YOU JUST THOUGH WHAT?

27:49.098 --> 27:51.000
YOU'RE WEIRDLY CLOSE WITH BEN.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.242
NO. NO! NOT WEIRDLY CLOSE.
ALL RIGHT?

27:53.242 --> 27:55.174
AWESOMELY COMMITTED.
HOW ABOUT THAT?

27:55.174 --> 27:56.776
THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE.

27:56.776 --> 27:58.908
SO YOU CAN JUST FORGET ABOUT
TRYING TO SEDUCE THIS GUY.

27:58.908 --> 28:03.853
IF I FEEL THE URGE TO TRADE
MY DIGNITY FOR A LITTLE
DROWSY NASTY,

28:03.853 --> 28:08.958
I'LL LISTEN TO JEWEL.
OR HIT THE PORN DRAWER.

28:09.358 --> 28:16.966
SO THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
I CAN DO TO CHANGE YOUR MIND?

28:16.966 --> 28:20.399
NO. NOT THAT I CAN THINK OF.
I'M SORRY.

28:20.399 --> 28:25.735
WELL, THEN YOU DON'T LEAVE ME
NO CHOICE.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.440
IS THAT MINE?

28:33.843 --> 28:36.816
AAH! AAH!

28:43.392 --> 28:45.024
BEN.

28:46.355 --> 28:50.229
YO. SAM, YOU WANNA TOSS ME ONE
OF THOSE COPPER SPRAY NOZZLES?

28:50.229 --> 28:51.761
QUICK. QUICK.

28:51.761 --> 28:52.501
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

28:52.501 --> 28:53.903
I'M BUILDING A FLAME THROWER.

28:53.903 --> 28:55.064
YOU MIND IF I ASK WHY?

28:55.064 --> 28:57.006
I'M BURNING DOWN NINA'S LAIR.
GONNA DRIVE HER OUT OF TOWN.

28:57.006 --> 29:00.940
ALSO WOULD YOU TOSS ONE
OF THOSE 3/8th COUPLETS
RIGHT THERE?

29:00.940 --> 29:04.143
SOCK, DOESN'T THAT SOUND
A LITTLE SEVERE, I MEAN,
EVEN BY YOUR STANDARDS?

29:04.143 --> 29:06.976
SHE CROSSED THE LINE, SAM.
SHE DID THAT DEMON TRICK.

29:06.976 --> 29:08.747
ALL RIGHT, SHE INVADED
MY DREAM WORLD.

29:08.747 --> 29:14.523
THIS IS MY SAFE PLACE.
NO ONE PENETRATES MY SAFE PLACE!

29:14.523 --> 29:16.425
HEY, SOCK,
HAVE YOU SEEN ANDI AROUND?

29:16.425 --> 29:18.527
I HEARD SHE CALLED IN SICK.

29:20.029 --> 29:20.930
[BEEP]

29:20.930 --> 29:26.936
ANDI, HEY, I HEARD YOU
WERE OUT SICK. I HOPE
IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF ME.

29:28.437 --> 29:31.200
HEY, KIDDO.

29:31.200 --> 29:34.173
GLOOMY SKY TODAY.

29:34.173 --> 29:36.245
FITS MY MOOD.

29:38.808 --> 29:39.548
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

29:39.548 --> 29:42.551
GOOD QUESTION. WHAT THE HELL
ARE WE DOING HERE?

29:42.551 --> 29:44.253
2 LOVE-STRUCK IDIOTS.

29:44.253 --> 29:49.018
CAUGHT UNDER THE SPELL
OF THE SAME WITCHY WOMAN.

29:49.018 --> 29:51.120
SO, YOU'RE NOT MAD AT ME?

29:51.120 --> 29:54.293
NO. HOW COULD I BE?

29:54.293 --> 29:57.827
WHAT MAN CAN RESIST SALLY?

30:00.299 --> 30:01.400
HERE.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.002
A VESSEL?

30:03.002 --> 30:05.975
YES. IT'S FOR SALLY.

30:05.975 --> 30:08.107
SHE'S AN ESCAPED SOUL?

30:08.107 --> 30:09.438
I LET HER OUT OF HELL, SAM.

30:09.438 --> 30:11.881
I SET HER UP IN THIS HOUSE.

30:11.881 --> 30:15.044
GOT HER A GOOD JOB.
SHOWERED HER WITH AFFECTION.

30:15.044 --> 30:17.286
AND STILL...

30:19.949 --> 30:23.052
IT'S A MATTER OF HONOR, SAMMY.

30:23.052 --> 30:24.954
HONOR.

31:08.567 --> 31:10.469
SAM!

31:11.070 --> 31:13.572
I WAS CONVINCED I'D SEEN
THE LAST OF YOU.

31:13.572 --> 31:15.074
YEAH. I WAS THINKING
WE COULD TALK.

31:15.074 --> 31:18.007
YES, ABOUT LAST NIGHT?
I'M SO SORRY.
WHAT A DISASTER.

31:18.007 --> 31:22.251
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER
THEN TO TRY AND SNEAK AROUND
ON THE DEVIL.

31:22.251 --> 31:24.954
I'M NOT HERE ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

31:24.954 --> 31:26.355
NO?

31:26.355 --> 31:28.387
THE DEVIL SENT ME.

31:28.387 --> 31:31.620
TO VESSEL YOU.
TO SEND YOU BACK TO HELL.

31:31.620 --> 31:37.967
HUH. I'M SORRY
IT'S COME TO THIS, SAM.

31:39.628 --> 31:43.232
I REALLY LIKE YOU.

31:43.232 --> 31:43.973
I LIKE YOU TOO.

31:43.973 --> 31:49.038
YES, I THOUGHT WE MADE
A REAL CONNECTION AT DINNER
LAST NIGHT.

31:49.038 --> 31:50.579
IF THE DEVIL HADN'T
INTERRUPTED

31:50.579 --> 31:53.442
WE MOST CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE
ENDED UP IN BED TOGETHER.

31:53.442 --> 32:00.089
IS THAT SOMETHING
THAT STILL INTERESTS YOU?

32:00.089 --> 32:01.390
BEING WITH ME?

32:01.390 --> 32:05.124
I HAVE A BETTER PLAN...
TO KEEP YOU OUT OF HELL.

32:05.124 --> 32:06.095
YOU DO?

32:06.095 --> 32:07.096
I'LL TELL THE DEVIL THE TRUTH.

32:07.096 --> 32:10.960
THIS WAS ALL MY DOING.
THAT YOU'RE INNOCENT.

32:10.960 --> 32:12.061
I WAS TRYING TO SEDUCE YOU.

32:12.061 --> 32:15.504
ALSO THAT I LIED
AND TOOK CREDIT FOR HIS GIFT.

32:15.504 --> 32:18.968
WHAT? THE STEAMER WAS
FROM THE DEVIL?

32:18.968 --> 32:20.039
YEAH.

32:20.039 --> 32:22.972
OH.

32:22.972 --> 32:26.575
I'M SORRY, SAM.
I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND.
WHY THE GUN?

32:26.575 --> 32:30.449
I MEAN, WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TELL THE DEVIL THE TRUTH?

32:30.449 --> 32:32.021
I MEAN, WHY ALL THIS DRAMA?

32:32.021 --> 32:36.585
'CAUSE YOU STILL HAVE SOMETHING
I WANT. SOMETHING YOU CAN TRADE
FOR YOUR FREEDOM.

32:36.585 --> 32:39.958
THE DEVIL'S SECRETS.
SECRETS THAT I NEED.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.730
OHH...

32:41.730 --> 32:43.662
ARE YOU BLACKMAILING ME?

32:43.662 --> 32:47.236
THINK OF IT AS A TRADE.
SHARE WHAT I NEED TO KNOW,

32:47.236 --> 32:48.097
AND YOU'LL STAY OUT OF HELL.

32:48.097 --> 32:50.969
I'LL GET OUT OF
FROM UNDER THE DEVIL.
IT'S A WIN-WIN.

32:50.969 --> 32:55.974
YOU'RE EXPECTING ME
TO BETRAY THE DEVIL?

32:55.974 --> 32:57.546
WELL...YEAH.

32:57.546 --> 32:59.078
I CAN'T DO THAT.

32:59.078 --> 33:02.351
YOU CAN'T?
I THOUGHT YOU HATED THE DEVIL?

33:02.351 --> 33:03.982
WELL, I DO. SOMETIMES.

33:03.982 --> 33:09.558
BUT OTHER TIMES--
OTHER TIMES I FIND HIM
QUITE...CHARMING.

33:09.558 --> 33:10.219
I MEAN, HE IS THE DEVIL.

33:10.219 --> 33:12.461
THE SECOND MOST POWERFUL
BEING IN ALL OF EXISTENCE.

33:12.461 --> 33:17.166
NOW I'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED
THE HIGH THAT PEOPLE
SAY THEY GET

33:17.166 --> 33:18.097
FROM KNOWING
THE LOVE OF GOD.

33:18.097 --> 33:19.028
SO I CAN'T REALLY COMPARE.

33:19.028 --> 33:22.731
BUT I CERTAINLY
KNOW THE RUSH

33:22.731 --> 33:29.708
THAT COMES WITH BEING
PURSUED BY THE DARK LORD.

33:46.095 --> 33:48.297
THIS DOESN'T HAVE
TO HAPPEN, SALLY!

33:48.297 --> 33:53.132
WE CAN STILL STRIKE A DEAL!

34:16.054 --> 34:17.756
WELL, THIS IS A FIRST.

34:17.756 --> 34:19.788
SO, ARE READY TO TALK TRADE?

34:19.788 --> 34:22.591
Man: HYAH!
