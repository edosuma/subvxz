WEBVTT

00:01.360 --> 00:02.122
Previously on The Good Wife...
J-Serve has stolen millions

00:02.170 --> 00:05.196
of dollars
of intellectual property.

00:05.230 --> 00:06.663
This civil suit
can't proceed

00:06.700 --> 00:10.761
until the criminal case
has been resolved.

00:10.810 --> 00:12.539
RAYNA:
If you help us

00:12.580 --> 00:13.638
beat the Feds,

00:13.680 --> 00:14.305
we can pick up
where we left off.

00:14.340 --> 00:15.409
You're serious?

00:15.440 --> 00:16.600
Yes.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.277
What choice do you have?

00:20.180 --> 00:22.444
MAN:
Turning to God.

00:22.490 --> 00:24.412
What role has God

00:24.450 --> 00:26.418
played in your life,
Senator Kirk?

00:26.460 --> 00:30.123
Pastor, they say there are
no atheists in foxholes.

00:30.160 --> 00:33.493
After my stroke, I was in a
very, very deep, uh, foxhole.

00:33.530 --> 00:37.068
Hmm. So-so you think
you've become more religious?

00:37.100 --> 00:39.466
I've become more respectful
of other people's faiths.

00:39.500 --> 00:40.797
I've heard you

00:40.840 --> 00:42.398
you go home every Friday
from the senate

00:42.440 --> 00:45.500
to spend the Jewish Sabbath
with your family.

00:45.540 --> 00:47.303
I go home every Friday
to be with my family.

00:47.340 --> 00:50.104
We're _members _
of Congregation Beth Elohim.

00:50.150 --> 00:52.812
It's where I feel at home
in the heart of Brooklyn.

00:52.850 --> 00:55.273
(clears throat)

00:55.320 --> 00:56.480
So, I have to do that?

00:56.520 --> 00:58.442
If you want to get elected.

00:58.490 --> 01:00.549
I thought it was a mistake
to talk about religion.

01:00.590 --> 01:02.387
It is except for Pastor
Jeremiah's interview.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.625
You run for office in Chicago,
you have to kiss the ring.

01:04.660 --> 01:06.321
These political rules
keep changing

01:06.360 --> 01:08.225
whenever you want them to.

01:08.260 --> 01:10.820
Yes, but you're on record saying
you're an atheist, Alicia.

01:10.870 --> 01:12.531
And voters don't
vote for atheists.

01:12.570 --> 01:13.662
So, you need to take this
opportunity to say

01:13.700 --> 01:15.395
that you've changed.
Changed to what?

01:15.440 --> 01:17.806
To someone who isn't an atheist.

01:17.840 --> 01:19.876
(doorbell rings)

01:19.910 --> 01:21.673
And if I don't say that?

01:21.710 --> 01:23.348
Then you'll lose.
And if I say it's

01:23.380 --> 01:24.540
none of their business?
It is their business.

01:24.580 --> 01:25.547
My lack of religion is
their business?

01:25.580 --> 01:26.547
Yes, you're asking them to vote

01:26.580 --> 01:28.172
for you so they deserve

01:28.220 --> 01:29.414
to know who you are.

01:29.450 --> 01:31.884
I'm an atheist.

01:31.920 --> 01:34.115
They deserve to know who we
want them to think you are.

01:34.160 --> 01:36.458
(doorbell rings)

01:38.160 --> 01:39.195
Hi.

01:39.230 --> 01:40.197
Hi.

01:40.230 --> 01:41.754
I'm your body woman.

01:41.800 --> 01:43.290
I'm sorry?

01:43.330 --> 01:44.763
I'm your body woman?

01:44.800 --> 01:46.392
I didn't know
what it was either.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.135
It's like _
your personal assrstant.

01:48.170 --> 01:50.604
I stick to you,
making sure you're on time,

01:50.640 --> 01:53.279
get on calls and your food
isn't poisoned.

01:54.610 --> 01:55.872
I'm Marissa. Eli's daughter.

01:55.910 --> 01:58.879
Oh, right. Hi.

01:58.910 --> 02:01.276
I actually don't think
I need a body woman.

02:01.320 --> 02:02.514
JOHNNY:
Yes, you do.

02:02.550 --> 02:04.541
Dad would be upset
if you said no

02:04.590 --> 02:05.784
'cause I'm supposed
to spy for him.

02:05.820 --> 02:07.310
But I'm not a very good spy.
(phone ringing)

02:07.360 --> 02:08.384
So don't worry.
Excuse me.

02:08.420 --> 02:10.524
I'm gonna...

02:10.560 --> 02:11.822
Hello?

02:11.860 --> 02:13.657
ELSBETH:
Alicia, where are you?

02:13.700 --> 02:14.928
Um, where am I?

02:14.960 --> 02:16.769
Yes, you're not here.

02:16.800 --> 02:19.394
Uh, Elsbeth, where are you?

02:19.440 --> 02:20.532
The FBI.

02:20.570 --> 02:21.468
We're meeting with Perotti

02:21.500 --> 02:23.661
about the trade secret case.

02:23.710 --> 02:24.938
Tomorrow.

02:24.970 --> 02:26.335
No, today.

02:26.380 --> 02:27.631
Yes, today until they called

02:27.680 --> 02:29.341
and said tomorrow.

02:29.380 --> 02:31.848
And they called everyone but me?

02:31.880 --> 02:33.711
Elsbeth, I have to go.

02:33.750 --> 02:35.411
I'll see you in court tomorrow.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.185
Oh.

02:42.460 --> 02:43.529
This department
considers this...

02:43.560 --> 02:44.822
I am a busy woman,

02:44.860 --> 02:46.327
Mr. Perotti.
I have more things

02:46.360 --> 02:47.793
to do with my time

02:47.830 --> 02:49.366
than to come here like a,

02:49.400 --> 02:51.868
like a woman dragged here

02:51.900 --> 02:54.266
out of her day.
How are you, Elsbeth?

02:54.300 --> 02:55.699
If you want to have lunch
with me, call my office.

02:55.740 --> 02:57.605
But don't pretend
it's about business,

02:57.640 --> 03:00.370
then call everybody
else not to show up,

03:00.410 --> 03:02.298
so it'll just be
me showing up.

03:02.350 --> 03:03.408
I don't like that tie.

03:03.450 --> 03:05.668
I'll change it. Camryn?

03:05.710 --> 03:07.575
Did you call Ms. Tascioni
and Mrs. Florrick

03:07.620 --> 03:09.747
last night and say
I had to cancel?

03:09.790 --> 03:11.417
Yes, sir. I got
Ms. Tascioni's secretary.

03:11.450 --> 03:13.657
(quietly):
Fantasia.

03:15.760 --> 03:17.751
I'm gonna go.

03:19.730 --> 03:21.652
So, I could ask you to lunch?

03:21.700 --> 03:24.624
I only said that
as an example.

03:24.670 --> 03:27.696
Is this case about me?

03:27.740 --> 03:30.436
(laughs)

03:30.470 --> 03:33.007
Elsbeth, your client
plagiarized their software

03:33.040 --> 03:35.008
from another company.
They did not.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.600
And even if they did,
they sell farting apps.

03:37.650 --> 03:39.618
They sell jumping
grasshopper apps.

03:39.650 --> 03:41.470
And encryption software.

03:41.520 --> 03:43.010
Why is the Federal government
suddenly so interested

03:43.050 --> 03:46.486
in protecting the code
of a grasshopper app?

03:46.520 --> 03:47.953
Because the code was plagiarized
from a defense contractor.

03:47.990 --> 03:50.720
You're making that up.

03:50.760 --> 03:51.829
I'm not.

03:51.860 --> 03:53.657
Well...

03:53.700 --> 03:54.758
you're still gonna lose.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.825
Alicia Florrick is on my side.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.826
You expected to divide
and conquer us.

03:58.870 --> 04:01.691
But it's gonna be hard to do
with both of us battling you.

04:01.740 --> 04:03.435
Elsbeth, what are you doing?

04:03.470 --> 04:04.767
I'm marshalling my forces.
I'm...

04:04.810 --> 04:06.778
The way you're walking.
What-what is that?

04:09.350 --> 04:10.999
You're scared
of sidewalk grates.

04:11.050 --> 04:12.779
(stammers)
No. What?!

04:12.820 --> 04:14.310
Yes! The way you're walking.

04:14.350 --> 04:16.580
You were avoiding the grates.
No!

04:16.620 --> 04:18.542
Oh, my God! You're so adorable.
Come here.

04:18.590 --> 04:19.682
Walk with me.
No, I'm fine.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.950
Come on.

04:21.990 --> 04:23.924
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop that!

04:23.960 --> 04:25.951
These things can support
10,000 pounds.

04:25.990 --> 04:27.753
I could be carrying a Humvee

04:27.800 --> 04:28.755
and I would still... Oh!

04:28.800 --> 04:30.495
(screams)

04:30.530 --> 04:31.758
(grunts)

04:31.800 --> 04:33.665
Hmm.

04:33.700 --> 04:35.565
That was mean.

04:35.600 --> 04:37.067
Hmm.
(sniffs)

04:37.110 --> 04:38.862
What do you smell like?

04:38.910 --> 04:40.502
It's beautiful.
Baby lotion.

04:40.540 --> 04:42.599
Baby lotion.

04:42.650 --> 04:45.005
I'm wearing Old Spice.

04:46.480 --> 04:48.072
Have lunch with me.

04:48.120 --> 04:50.088
No.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.486
I have to go.

04:52.520 --> 04:54.511
This case is wrong.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.551
And you need to stop it.

05:00.630 --> 05:02.359
(elevator bell dings)
WOMAN:
Lockhart/Gardner/Canning,

05:02.400 --> 05:03.765
please hold.

05:03.800 --> 05:04.721
Lockhart/Gardner/Canning,

05:04.770 --> 05:06.362
would you mind
holding, please?

05:06.400 --> 05:08.038
This is Lockhart/
Gardner/Canning...

05:08.070 --> 05:10.664
CANNING: Family is important
to this firm.

05:10.710 --> 05:12.735
I realize it's
an old fashioned thing to say

05:12.780 --> 05:14.372
because we live
In cynical times,

05:14.410 --> 05:16.901
but_ we treat our clients
like they're family.

05:16.950 --> 05:19.441
We're highly accessible, which
is why I give them my cell...

05:19.480 --> 05:21.573
Son of a bitch!

05:21.620 --> 05:22.985
We're being evicted.

05:23.020 --> 05:24.510
How is that even possible?

05:24.550 --> 05:26.359
Diane still sub-leases to us.

05:26.390 --> 05:28.358
When Will died she became
the primary lease-holder.

05:28.390 --> 05:29.982
So, what does she want-- money?
No. She wants

05:30.030 --> 05:31.679
us out so she can move in. Look.

05:31.730 --> 05:34.051
I have a friend at OSHA.

05:34.100 --> 05:36.022
Jacques Cousteau's son?

05:36.060 --> 05:37.061
What?

05:37.100 --> 05:39.568
At... OSHA?

05:39.600 --> 05:42.034
See if we can set her up
as an absentee landlord.

05:42.070 --> 05:45.767
Yes, we can load up on
all the OSHA infractions.

05:45.810 --> 05:46.777
DIANE:
"Handrails or ramps.

05:46.810 --> 05:49.472
"$120,000 for installation.

05:49.510 --> 05:51.000
"Handicapped restroom stall.

05:51.050 --> 05:52.574
"98,000.

05:52.620 --> 05:53.609
"Warped reception floor.

05:53.650 --> 05:55.618
$333,000."

05:55.650 --> 05:56.787
ALICIA: And you're wondering
if we should pay?

05:56.820 --> 05:58.481
Yes, the total is
$650,000.

05:58.520 --> 05:59.817
I don't understand.

05:59.860 --> 06:00.918
Can‘t we evict_ them
wrthout paying?

06:00.960 --> 06:02.655
Yes. But then they'll sue.

06:02.690 --> 06:04.123
The question is
do we take the hit?

06:04.160 --> 06:06.549
CARY: No, the question is
why are we moving at all?

06:06.600 --> 06:08.454
Cary, we already voted.

06:08.500 --> 06:09.865
CARY:
Alicia, we are ending up

06:09.900 --> 06:11.128
right back where we started.

06:11.170 --> 06:12.489
Yes, but we will still be us.

06:12.540 --> 06:13.962
We won't be Lockhart/Gardner.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.831
The whole point
of starting our own firm

06:15.870 --> 06:17.861
was so that we can build
something on our own.

06:17.910 --> 06:19.707
And if we weren't
financially in a hole,

06:19.740 --> 06:21.537
we might be able to do more
with our infrastructure.

06:21.580 --> 06:22.774
Come on. I didn't ask you
to bail me out.

06:22.810 --> 06:24.038
ALICIA: Cary, I wasn't talking
about bail.

06:24.080 --> 06:25.741
You may not need to pay.

06:25.780 --> 06:26.815
What do you mean?
(Alicia and Cary arguing)

06:26.850 --> 06:28.818
Alicia, Cary, hold on. Hold on!

06:28.850 --> 06:30.886
BAILIFF: All rise!
I have to go anyway.

06:30.920 --> 06:32.046
I'll call you later.

06:32.090 --> 06:33.819
Canning has real estate.

06:33.860 --> 06:35.680
My guess is he'll have just

06:35.720 --> 06:37.585
as many OSHA issues
on his property.

06:37.630 --> 06:39.894
Good. See what you can find out.

06:39.930 --> 06:41.818
Let's hold off
on discussing this

06:41.860 --> 06:44.567
until Kalinda can find out more.

06:44.600 --> 06:46.591
Cary, where are you?
Five dollars.

06:47.900 --> 06:50.562
Iw Core-- the five
Iw League law schools.

06:50.610 --> 06:52.976
Every time someone does work,
it's five dollars.

06:53.010 --> 06:54.602
Let's go.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.039
Pay up.

06:56.080 --> 06:58.173
MAN: _
My name IS

06:58.210 --> 06:59.916
Nils Landrusyshym.

06:59.950 --> 07:01.838
That's spelled the usual way.

07:05.820 --> 07:08.687
It's L-A-N-D-R-U-S-

07:08.720 --> 07:10.779
Y-S-H-Y-M.

07:10.830 --> 07:12.798
I'm an app designer at J-Serve.

07:12.830 --> 07:14.593
And before that you worked
at QZO Systems.

07:14.630 --> 07:16.791
Is that correct,
Mr. Landrusyshym?

07:16.830 --> 07:18.764
You pronounced my name right.
Thanks, man.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.836
Well, that's because I listen.
Objection.

07:20.870 --> 07:23.839
Mr. Perotti is trying
to endear himself

07:23.870 --> 07:24.802
to the_ witness.
(whispers):
In my opinion.

07:24.840 --> 07:26.478
What?

07:26.510 --> 07:27.875
You have to say
"In my opinion."

07:27.910 --> 07:28.934
Are you hazing me?

07:29.880 --> 07:32.144
In my opinion, Your Honor.

07:32.180 --> 07:33.875
Sustained.

07:33.920 --> 07:35.649
Uh, I'm sor... uh,
what was the objection?

07:35.680 --> 07:37.648
What am I doing wrong?
Don't endear yourself

07:37.690 --> 07:38.884
to the witness.
Okay.

07:38.920 --> 07:40.888
Thank you, Ms. Tascioni.

07:40.920 --> 07:41.784
Mrs.

07:41.820 --> 07:43.720
"Mrs."?

07:43.760 --> 07:44.784
You're married?

07:44.830 --> 07:46.491
I was. I'm divorced.

07:46.530 --> 07:47.724
I didn't know that.
You didn't ask.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.796
JUDGE:
Excuse me, Counselors.

07:49.830 --> 07:51.525
We're in the middle
of questioning here.
Oh, sorry.

07:51.570 --> 07:53.959
Um, what was the question?

07:54.000 --> 07:57.538
Uh, before J-Serve, did he work
at QZO Systems?

07:57.570 --> 08:00.971
You may answer,
Mr. Landroo-shim-shum.

08:01.010 --> 08:03.103
Yes, I did.
And QZO is a contractor

08:03.150 --> 08:05.869
for the United States
Department of Defense, isn't it?
Yup.

08:05.910 --> 08:07.946
If you're ever looking for a
tracking or a monitoring system,

08:07.980 --> 08:09.641
they're your go-to.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.612
Mr. Landrusyshym,
what is that?

08:11.650 --> 08:14.050
Those are lines of code.
from the DelCheck app.

08:14.090 --> 08:15.284
Code that you wrote?
Uh, yeah.

08:15.320 --> 08:17.026
A Nils Landrusyshym original.

08:17.060 --> 08:18.948
Camilla, the app
that he was working on--

08:18.990 --> 08:20.753
did you sell that
as part of the package

08:20.800 --> 08:22.028
to China?
Yes. Why?

08:22.060 --> 08:23.925
And what is that?

08:23.970 --> 08:25.790
Uh, that looks like
the same code.
It is, in fact.

08:25.830 --> 08:27.764
This is identical code used
by your former employer QZO.

08:27.800 --> 08:30.735
Code which you also wrote.

08:30.770 --> 08:32.874
_ You used the same code
In each company's product.

08:32.910 --> 08:34.036
Your Honor, objection.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.105
The AUSA, in our opinion,

08:36.140 --> 08:38.301
is not being upfront
about the real charges.

08:38.350 --> 08:40.978
I'm not sure what the defense
is talking about, Your Honor.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.847
Your... Honor?

08:44.890 --> 08:46.812
(whispers):
In your opinion.

08:48.060 --> 08:49.925
Uh, in my opinion,

08:49.960 --> 08:51.222
Your Honor.
I would agree, Ms. Florrick.

08:51.260 --> 08:52.989
What is the issue here?

08:53.030 --> 08:54.224
This is a Trojan Horse
prosecution, Your Honor.

08:54.260 --> 08:56.967
The AUSA, in our opinion,

08:57.000 --> 08:59.161
has _no intention
of trying our client,

08:59.200 --> 09:00.997
Camilla Vargas,
on Trade Secret charges.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.031
China?!

09:03.070 --> 09:04.708
Mr. Perotti intends to bring

09:04.740 --> 09:06.059
economic espionage charges

09:06.110 --> 09:08.032
against our client,

09:08.080 --> 09:09.707
in my opinion,
and he has disguised

09:09.750 --> 09:11.001
his true intentions

09:11.050 --> 09:13.041
to get our witnesses
on the record.

09:13.080 --> 09:14.342
Is that true, Mr. Perotti?

09:14.380 --> 09:15.847
Your Honor..._
Answer the question,

09:15.880 --> 09:17.040
AUSA?

09:18.820 --> 09:21.050
Camilla Vargas was CEO
of J-Serve

09:21.090 --> 09:23.024
when they sold
proprietary software

09:23.060 --> 09:24.880
from a defense contractor
to a Chinese company.

09:24.930 --> 09:27.057
A civil Chinese company.

09:27.100 --> 09:30.627
A civil Chinese company with
ties to the Chinese government.

09:30.670 --> 09:32.934
That encryption software
designed for our defense

09:32.970 --> 09:34.938
is now in the hands
of the Chinese.

09:34.970 --> 09:37.609
And those responsible
at J-Serve are now subject

09:37.640 --> 09:39.631
to charges
of economic espionage,

09:39.680 --> 09:41.102
with a minimum sentence
of ten to 15 years

09:41.140 --> 09:43.074
in a Federal penitentiary.
Oh, my God.

09:43.110 --> 09:44.805
So, yes, I would like
to amend the charge

09:44.850 --> 09:46.818
to economic espionage.

10:04.970 --> 10:06.028
WOMAN: How do you stop a lawyer
from drowning?

10:06.070 --> 10:07.628
Shoot him before
he hits the water.

10:07.670 --> 10:10.104
You really do
know them all!

10:10.140 --> 10:12.631
So, what's the name
of your firm?

10:12.680 --> 10:14.102
Florrick-Agos.
Oh.

10:14.140 --> 10:16.005
Right, right.
The governor's wife.

10:16.040 --> 10:18.008
Yeah.
Good firm?

10:18.050 --> 10:20.177
Yeah, yeah.
We have our days.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.847
I heard one of the partners
got in trouble.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.814
Arrested or something.
Yeah.

10:23.850 --> 10:25.283
Cary Agos.

10:25.320 --> 10:28.983
Right. What's he like?

10:29.020 --> 10:32.023
He is a good guy.

10:32.060 --> 10:34.051
(laughs)

10:35.160 --> 10:37.196
Ah, you are,
you are looking at him.

10:37.230 --> 10:40.961
Really?

10:41.000 --> 10:42.069
Uh...

10:47.010 --> 10:48.136
Thank you. Okay.

10:48.180 --> 10:49.169
Tonight. 8:00 pm.

10:49.210 --> 10:50.177
Castro interviews first.

10:50.210 --> 10:51.871
You second.
What do I say?

10:51.910 --> 10:53.719
You walk back the atheism.
Yes, but how?

10:53.750 --> 10:55.172
You don't need to bring me
coffee, Marissa.

10:55.220 --> 10:56.278
It's not coffee, it's milk.

10:56.320 --> 10:57.309
Dad says you should use

10:57.350 --> 10:58.817
the courthouse shooting.

10:58.850 --> 11:00.056
It made you decide
to change your life.

11:00.090 --> 11:01.717
No, I'm not gonna use that.
Why milk?

11:01.760 --> 11:03.250
Why not?
"Recently,

11:03.290 --> 11:05.121
"I've realized my negativity
toward religion was based on

11:05.160 --> 11:07.720
seeing the hypocrisy among
the ultra-conservative."

11:07.760 --> 11:09.352
What is that?
It's a quote.
For you.

11:09.400 --> 11:11.368
_ "But then I realized there
IS great warmth and beauty

11:11.400 --> 11:13.391
in a higher
being."
"Realized"?
What is she, eight?

11:13.440 --> 11:15.067
She just "realized"...
Whoa.
Excuse me.

11:15.100 --> 11:16.965
The body woman isn't
supposed to talk so much.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.365
Oh, uh, I guess I'm not supposed
to have an opinion.

11:19.410 --> 11:22.299
How about that book
by Barbara Ehrenreich?

11:22.340 --> 11:23.898
Why don't you say
you've read it and you got

11:23.950 --> 11:25.076
to thinking about
God in a new way?

11:25.110 --> 11:26.304
Sort of a... epiphany.

11:26.350 --> 11:27.317
They don't want to hear
about epiphanies.

11:27.350 --> 11:29.011
They're like Orthodox Jews.

11:29.050 --> 11:30.119
They want to know if
you're in their column.

11:30.150 --> 11:31.742
Who are
you calling?

11:31.790 --> 11:33.155
Hello?

11:33.190 --> 11:34.851
ALICIA:
Grace, it's Mom.

11:34.890 --> 11:37.256
Religion is in my life again.

11:37.290 --> 11:39.850
*

11:52.540 --> 11:54.132
So, you're the felon?

11:55.380 --> 11:58.144
That's me,
the hardened criminal.

11:59.280 --> 12:01.942
You heading out?
I was.

12:01.980 --> 12:04.187
Back to lockup.

12:04.220 --> 12:07.189
So Harvard to holding.

12:07.220 --> 12:09.108
Sounds like a book.
A short one.

12:09.160 --> 12:11.219
Three days behind bars-- that
doesn't give you much material.

12:11.260 --> 12:12.420
No gang rape?

12:14.300 --> 12:15.949
No.

12:17.300 --> 12:18.324
Strangely enough, not.

12:18.370 --> 12:20.531
Well, that's too bad.

12:20.570 --> 12:23.004
'Cause that would've
been a turn-on.

12:31.449 --> 12:31.480
(sniffing)

12:31.480 --> 12:33.448
Is that baby lotion?

12:33.480 --> 12:35.311
(elevator bell dings)

12:38.020 --> 12:40.079
(Alicia speaking quietly)

12:41.590 --> 12:43.820
It's not enough to show
that the codes are similar.

12:43.860 --> 12:47.250
To prove economic espionage,
they need to show that you knew

12:47.300 --> 12:49.359
the Chinese company was going
to give it to the government.

12:49.400 --> 12:50.992
Good.
Because I didn't.

12:51.030 --> 12:52.224
Okay, I'll cross-examine.

12:52.270 --> 12:53.339
Why?

12:55.300 --> 12:57.962
The AUSA has

12:58.010 --> 12:59.238
a thing for me.

12:59.270 --> 13:00.271
I think I can
distract him.

13:00.310 --> 13:02.335
BAILIFF:
All rise.

13:02.380 --> 13:03.870
Edwin Fong.

13:03.910 --> 13:05.275
Owner and managing partner

13:05.310 --> 13:07.210
of The Fong Consulting Group.
PERO'I'I'I:
Mr. Fong,

13:07.250 --> 13:09.241
you are the one
who brokered the sale

13:09.280 --> 13:10.542
of the app
in question

13:10.590 --> 13:12.217
between J-Serve and
the Baowen Group?
I did.

13:12.250 --> 13:15.378
J-Serve was eager to make
a bigger push into China.

13:15.420 --> 13:18.082
I connected them
with Mr. Baowen.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.997
So you worked closely with
Camilla Vargas when she was CEO?

13:21.030 --> 13:22.895
The defendant?
FONG:
For three years, yes.

13:22.930 --> 13:24.227
She was the one
who hired my firm.

13:24.270 --> 13:26.568
Okay.

13:26.600 --> 13:27.828
Um...

13:27.870 --> 13:30.065
And did you

13:30.110 --> 13:32.874
keep Ms. Vargas in the loop

13:32.910 --> 13:35.378
during the app negotiations?
FONG:
I did. I had to.

13:35.410 --> 13:36.946
She wanted to
know every detail.

13:38.910 --> 13:41.276
And did she, uh...

13:41.320 --> 13:43.185
Did the
defendant...

13:43.220 --> 13:45.017
Uh, did, um...

13:45.050 --> 13:46.244
(quietly):
Ms. Vargas.

13:46.290 --> 13:48.315
Right. Ms. Vargas.

13:50.390 --> 13:52.187
Did she... did, uh...

13:52.230 --> 13:53.219
uh, strike that.

13:53.260 --> 13:55.091
Did you ask her whether

13:55.130 --> 13:57.269
Mr. Baowen's company
was connected

13:57.300 --> 13:59.564
to the Chinese
government?
Yes. And I
told her yes.

13:59.600 --> 14:02.239
That's a lie.
PERO'I'I'I:
So she knew this app--

14:02.270 --> 14:04.306
this stolen app-- would make
its way to the Chinese?

14:04.340 --> 14:05.637
Objection, Your Honor.

14:05.670 --> 14:07.376
Calls for speculation,
in my opinion.

14:07.410 --> 14:09.298
JUDGE:
Yes. Sustained.

14:11.150 --> 14:12.879
Mr. Perotti?

14:12.920 --> 14:15.138
Yes, Your Honor.

14:15.180 --> 14:16.943
Oh, I'm good. I'm good.

14:18.220 --> 14:19.619
questions.

14:34.670 --> 14:37.138
Mr. Fong,
is Camilla Vargas a bitch?

14:37.170 --> 14:39.229
Objection, Your Honor.
That calls for an opinion.

14:39.270 --> 14:41.477
Actually, Your Honor,
I'm just quoting Mr. Fong

14:41.510 --> 14:43.102
from last week's trial.

14:43.150 --> 14:44.902
"I advised J-Serve

14:44.950 --> 14:47.009
"that China is_ a
patriarchal soaety.

14:47.050 --> 14:49.143
"And having a brash and bitchy

14:49.180 --> 14:51.319
female CEO_ was
problematic."

14:51.350 --> 14:53.614
Didn't you say
that, Mr. Fong?
FONG:
Yes, but just

14:53.660 --> 14:57.084
to be clear, I put air-quotes
around "bitchy."

14:57.130 --> 14:58.927
So you were quoting

14:58.960 --> 15:00.621
someone who called her bitchy?

15:00.660 --> 15:03.197
No.

15:03.230 --> 15:05.369
And, um, wasn't it your
opinion that Ms. Vargas

15:05.400 --> 15:07.197
be left out of
the negotiations?

15:07.240 --> 15:09.060
Didn't you
testify to that?

15:10.440 --> 15:12.567
Is that a "yes,"
Mr. Fong?
Yes.

15:12.610 --> 15:14.077
In fact, you went
over her head

15:14.110 --> 15:16.078
to the board
of directors,

15:16.110 --> 15:18.203
and kept key information
away from Ms. Vargas.

15:19.380 --> 15:21.371
Mr. Fong?

15:21.420 --> 15:22.569
Yes.

15:22.620 --> 15:24.247
Nothing further.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.159
(mouthing)

15:29.190 --> 15:31.579
It's odd,
being back.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.589
It's like being
behind enemy lines.

15:35.630 --> 15:37.063
Looks good.

15:37.100 --> 15:38.419
Oh, yeah.

15:38.470 --> 15:40.529
Good evening.
DIANE:
And to you as well.

15:40.570 --> 15:41.969
CANNING:
May I offer you
something to drink?

15:42.000 --> 15:43.160
Um, no,
we're fine.

15:43.210 --> 15:45.098
Any more pleasantries
or shall we start?

15:45.140 --> 15:47.074
How is your health,
Mr. Canning?

15:47.110 --> 15:49.271
Well, I'm on a list for
kidney transplants.

15:50.310 --> 15:51.379
I'm sorry.

15:51.410 --> 15:52.502
CANNING:
Oh, don't be.

15:52.550 --> 15:54.245
At least I'm
on the list.

15:54.280 --> 15:56.111
And, uh, I feel
kind of ghoulish,

15:56.150 --> 15:57.344
waiting for someone to die
and give me a kidney.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.210
Well, I really, um...

15:59.250 --> 16:01.252
I hope things work out.

16:01.290 --> 16:02.416
Thank you.

16:02.460 --> 16:03.688
I don't suppose

16:03.730 --> 16:05.152
one of those
folders holds

16:05.190 --> 16:07.192
a check for
$550,000?

16:07.230 --> 16:09.596
KALINDA:
44 Brewer Street.
1530 Carpenter Avenue.

16:09.630 --> 16:11.495
(laughs)
220 Lonsdale Road.

16:11.530 --> 16:12.758
What?

16:12.800 --> 16:14.688
Those are my
buildings.

16:14.740 --> 16:17.334
They're-they're using the same
OSHA complaints against me

16:17.370 --> 16:18.769
that I used
against them.

16:18.810 --> 16:20.175
Yes, there are
a dozen violations

16:20.210 --> 16:21.677
of the Americans
with Disabilities Act.

16:21.710 --> 16:24.144
Total cost to repair
is $1.6 million.

16:24.180 --> 16:26.501
If you drop the OSHA charges
against me,

16:26.550 --> 16:29.178
we won't push
these against you.

16:29.220 --> 16:30.209
Okay.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.512
Louis.

16:31.550 --> 16:33.609
No, they-they
have us.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.458
We won't report
your violations.

16:36.490 --> 16:37.718
You have my word.

16:40.830 --> 16:43.560
Well, thank you.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.488
And, uh, again,
I'm very sorry

16:45.530 --> 16:46.724
about your
health issues.

16:46.770 --> 16:49.091
Let me know if
I can do anything.

16:49.140 --> 16:50.368
CANNING:
Well, there is something.

16:50.410 --> 16:51.707
DAVID:
So we went back
to the amendment

16:51.740 --> 16:54.231
to the lease agreement.
Page 24,

16:54.280 --> 16:56.236
paragraph 18C.

16:56.280 --> 16:57.679
It requires your
physical presence

16:57.710 --> 16:59.541
_on the_
premises, Diane.

16:59.580 --> 17:01.468
And your physical presence ended

17:01.520 --> 17:03.249
when you walked out.
Four weeks ago?

17:03.290 --> 17:04.279
Four weeks, two days.

17:04.320 --> 17:05.582
_ DAVID:
Since you're
in violation

17:05.620 --> 17:07.417
of this lease
and no longer have

17:07.460 --> 17:09.280
any legal hold
on the property...

17:09.320 --> 17:11.356
you can't evict us.

17:13.500 --> 17:14.728
CANNING:
But, Diane,

17:14.760 --> 17:17.024
thank you for your concern.

17:18.370 --> 17:19.325
(sighs)
Do you want to drop this?

17:19.370 --> 17:21.338
What do you mean?

17:21.370 --> 17:23.804
Well, there is a way
to beat them.

17:23.840 --> 17:25.831
How? I haven't been here
for four weeks.

17:25.870 --> 17:28.134
I remember having
that amendment inserted

17:28.180 --> 17:29.431
when I thought that
Will would push me out.

17:29.480 --> 17:31.243
It doesn't require
your personal presence.

17:31.280 --> 17:33.339
It just requires
a partner

17:33.380 --> 17:35.814
from Florrick-Agos
to be an occupant.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.110
VVho?

17:39.150 --> 17:41.152
(snoring)

17:42.520 --> 17:43.748
DIANE:
No.

17:43.790 --> 17:45.655
Yep.

17:45.690 --> 17:49.524
(laughing)

17:49.560 --> 17:52.358
And how do you pray?

17:52.400 --> 17:53.628
With ACTS?

17:53.670 --> 17:55.831
With any other mnemonic device?

17:55.870 --> 17:57.667
ALICIA:
Acts. That's
from the Bible?

17:57.710 --> 17:59.803
No, um... ACTS.

17:59.840 --> 18:01.876
Adoration,
confession,

18:01.910 --> 18:03.400
thanksgiving and
supplication.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.270
It's to remind
you how to pray:

18:05.310 --> 18:07.517
not just to
ask for things.

18:07.550 --> 18:09.313
But, Mom, you don't
need to know all this.

18:09.350 --> 18:10.715
I know, I just want
to feel comfortable.

18:10.750 --> 18:12.547
It's like opening
arguments in court.

18:12.590 --> 18:14.251
I know I won't
use it all,

18:14.290 --> 18:16.155
but it makes me
conﬁdent

18:18.290 --> 18:19.689
Are you going to say
that you believe in God?

18:19.730 --> 18:21.391
No.

18:21.430 --> 18:24.263
Are you going to say
that you're an atheist?

18:24.300 --> 18:26.165
No.

18:26.200 --> 18:28.259
Then what are
you gonna say?

18:28.300 --> 18:29.528
I don't know.

18:29.570 --> 18:30.764
That I think
I'm struggling with it?

18:30.810 --> 18:32.232
Are you?

18:32.270 --> 18:34.272
No.

18:34.310 --> 18:35.572
Maybe.
I don't know.

18:35.610 --> 18:37.305
You want some
help with that?

18:37.350 --> 18:38.749
(laughs)

18:38.780 --> 18:41.647
I can't believe
in God, Grace.

18:41.680 --> 18:43.147
I know.

18:45.220 --> 18:46.380
Why not?

18:46.420 --> 18:49.389
I don't feel it
the way you do.

18:49.420 --> 18:50.785
I don't feel
the need.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.582
Then what's
the struggle?

18:56.200 --> 18:57.827
Politics.

19:00.370 --> 19:01.689
Okay.

19:03.540 --> 19:04.734
You don't judge me?

19:04.770 --> 19:07.409
No.

19:09.610 --> 19:10.872
I love you.

19:14.680 --> 19:16.568
(muffled rock music playing,
elevator bell dings)

19:16.620 --> 19:18.542
(elevator doors open,
woman giggling)

19:18.590 --> 19:21.514
CARY:
Hold on, hold on.
Gotta get my keys.

19:21.560 --> 19:24.154
(giggles)

19:25.560 --> 19:27.198
Oh, damn.

19:27.230 --> 19:28.697
What?

19:28.730 --> 19:30.721
Mr. Agos.
Good evening.

19:30.770 --> 19:33.295
Ms. Grubick.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.763
You've been drinking, Mr. Agos.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.233
I have.

19:37.270 --> 19:38.464
Which is my right.

19:38.510 --> 19:39.704
GRUBICK:
It is. Any drugs?

19:39.740 --> 19:42.402
Not yet.
But the night is young.

19:42.440 --> 19:43.839
CARY:
No, she's joking.

19:43.880 --> 19:46.269
SYLMAR (laughing):
No, I'm not.

19:46.310 --> 19:47.675
Who is this, Cary?

19:47.720 --> 19:50.689
I am Mr. Agos's
pretrial services officer.

19:50.720 --> 19:52.517
My job is to make certain

19:52.550 --> 19:55.383
Mr. Agos lives up to
the dictates of his bail.

19:55.420 --> 19:56.580
I wish you called, Ms. Grubick.

19:56.620 --> 19:59.919
Well, when I spot-check,
I don't call.

20:01.360 --> 20:03.590
Where's your bathroom?

20:03.630 --> 20:04.892
Through there.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.388
Which of you
drove home?

20:08.440 --> 20:09.691
Neither.

20:09.740 --> 20:11.867
We were too
inebriated.
Good.

20:11.910 --> 20:13.468
How many bedrooms?

20:13.510 --> 20:15.478
One.

20:15.510 --> 20:17.444
Did you take a taxi?
No, we got
an Uber.

20:17.480 --> 20:20.472
Oh, good,
an Uber car.

20:20.520 --> 20:21.544
Can I see?

20:21.580 --> 20:23.309
See...?

20:23.350 --> 20:24.612
The, uh, record on your iPhone.

20:24.650 --> 20:26.288
SYLMAR:
You don't have to
show her anything!

20:26.320 --> 20:27.412
I'm not lying.

20:27.460 --> 20:30.452
I didn't think you were.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.651
Cary, you're obviously

20:32.690 --> 20:34.624
severely inebriated.

20:34.660 --> 20:36.457
You weren't
at work all day.

20:36.500 --> 20:37.592
Your immediate superior
didn't know where you were.

20:37.630 --> 20:39.518
I was at_a
Harvard mixer.

20:39.570 --> 20:41.959
Your companion says
you're planning to use drugs.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.002
She was joking.
All I'm asking

20:44.040 --> 20:46.804
is to see the Uber trip
on your iPhone

20:46.840 --> 20:49.673
to confirm that
you were not drivmg.

20:53.950 --> 20:56.510
Click on the Uber app

20:56.550 --> 20:58.916
for me, please?

20:58.950 --> 21:00.486
Thank you.

21:02.420 --> 21:03.648
(disappointed sigh)

21:03.690 --> 21:04.884
What?

21:04.930 --> 21:06.488
Cary, I'm going to have
to call officers,

21:06.530 --> 21:07.997
place you under arrest.

21:08.030 --> 21:09.429
What? Why?

21:09.460 --> 21:10.722
You went over
the state line.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.567
You were in Indiana.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.067
Oh, come on.

21:14.100 --> 21:15.533
Are you kidding me?

21:15.570 --> 21:16.764
No.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.768
The terms of your bail
were quite explicit.

21:18.810 --> 21:20.698
You are confined to Illinois.

21:20.740 --> 21:22.401
It was a half-mile
into Indiana.

21:22.440 --> 21:23.441
Yeah, and
I told you

21:23.480 --> 21:25.607
to take this more seriously.

21:25.650 --> 21:28.574
The court takes this
very seriously.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.383
Hello, yes.

21:30.420 --> 21:33.412
This is, uh,
PSO 12-385.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.552
I need an officer.

21:34.590 --> 21:36.012
Please, Ms. Grubick.
I made a mistake.

21:36.060 --> 21:37.459
I wasn't thinking
about where I was going.

21:37.490 --> 21:39.549
1313 Barbary Court.

21:39.590 --> 21:41.592
No rush.

21:41.630 --> 21:43.598
Thank you.

21:43.630 --> 21:44.790
(phone beeps off)

21:44.830 --> 21:46.491
This is stupid.

21:50.640 --> 21:53.632
MAN:
Three... two... one.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.830
And now, turning to God...

21:55.880 --> 21:57.108
Uh-oh.

21:57.140 --> 21:58.698
(laughing):
Now why do you
say "uh-oh"?

21:58.750 --> 22:00.445
I think you're preparing

22:00.480 --> 22:02.345
to pull a quote from my past.

22:02.380 --> 22:04.610
That's fine,
she's doing fine.

22:04.650 --> 22:05.981
You're making
me nervous.

22:06.020 --> 22:07.658
Oh, I have to go get her.

22:07.690 --> 22:08.918
JEREMIAH:
Well, a matter of fact, uh...

22:08.960 --> 22:10.757
two years ago,
you went on the record

22:10.790 --> 22:12.724
and declared that
you were an atheist.

22:12.760 --> 22:14.022
Now, do you still
believe that?

22:14.060 --> 22:16.449
Do I believe that
I'm an atheist?

22:16.500 --> 22:18.866
You were quite
insistent at the time.

22:18.900 --> 22:20.697
(laughs)
That sounds like me.

22:20.740 --> 22:22.992
My life has gone through a
lot of changes over the years.

22:23.040 --> 22:24.905
You're speaking of the scandal?

22:24.940 --> 22:26.703
Yes, and everything.

22:26.740 --> 22:30.801
If you had asked me six years
ago where I would be today,

22:30.850 --> 22:32.806
it would not be running
for state's attorney.

22:32.850 --> 22:33.874
(chuckles)

22:33.920 --> 22:35.512
Yes, life is humbling.

22:35.550 --> 22:36.517
It is that.

22:36.550 --> 22:38.484
And with each passing month,

22:38.520 --> 22:41.557
I find my dogmatism decreasing.

22:41.590 --> 22:43.057
I don't understand.

22:43.090 --> 22:44.648
ALICIA:
Well, I can't say for certain

22:44.690 --> 22:45.884
that God doesn't exist.

22:45.930 --> 22:48.148
Ugh, say it positively,
not negatively.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.896
Okay. So you're
not not an atheist.

22:50.930 --> 22:54.161
(laughs) I'm sorry, that's my
inner-lawyer coming out.

22:54.200 --> 22:57.499
I'm listening.

22:57.540 --> 23:01.499
If it's one thing I hate
it's when people don't listen.

23:01.540 --> 23:04.475
So, I'm open.

23:04.510 --> 23:07.673
To people who talk about God?

23:07.720 --> 23:13.044
Yes. Recently, I have looked
for answers outside of myself.

23:13.090 --> 23:14.978
Is this due to the shooting
in the courthouse

23:15.020 --> 23:17.011
last year
of your law partner?

23:19.030 --> 23:20.622
I'm sorry.

23:20.660 --> 23:22.890
It's probably still difficult
for you to talk about that.

23:24.030 --> 23:25.998
It is.

23:26.030 --> 23:27.588
Good, good.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.164
JEREMIAH: There's never
a way to prepare for death.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.667
No.

23:30.710 --> 23:32.860
And God sometimes
fills the void.

23:36.040 --> 23:38.008
You were talking
about listening to people

23:38.050 --> 23:39.642
who share their love of God.

23:39.680 --> 23:43.548
Now, is one of those people
your daughter, Grace?

23:43.590 --> 23:46.684
JEREMIAH:
I understand that she's become
a Christian, herself,

23:46.720 --> 23:47.948
over the last couple of years.

23:47.990 --> 23:50.117
Yes, it is not
just the politicians

23:50.160 --> 23:52.788
who have good research interns.

23:52.830 --> 23:53.990
(laughs)

23:54.030 --> 23:55.497
Has Grace talked to you?

23:55.530 --> 23:56.827
Yes.

23:56.860 --> 23:57.997
And shared her witness?

23:58.030 --> 24:01.431
Well, she's talked to me
about God.

24:04.110 --> 24:05.964
You love your daughter
very much, don't you?

24:07.510 --> 24:08.932
Yes.

24:08.980 --> 24:11.949
I know you're uncomfortable
talking about Christ

24:11.980 --> 24:14.073
and Grace sharing
her faith journey,

24:14.120 --> 24:18.739
but she must have had some kind
of impact on your thinking?

24:18.790 --> 24:22.248
Yes, she has.

24:22.290 --> 24:23.621
Mrs. Florrick.

24:24.530 --> 24:26.054
Yes, that's it.

24:26.090 --> 24:28.024
I know you don't pray, not yet.

24:28.060 --> 24:29.925
But I want
to pray With you.

24:29.960 --> 24:33.669
And I'm sure Grace is praying at
this very moment for you, too.

24:35.300 --> 24:39.862
JEREMIAH: God, thank you
for Alicia's honesty tonight...

24:42.880 --> 24:45.804
MARISSA:
That went well.

24:49.320 --> 24:51.948
I was in Israel
for a couple years.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.958
Everybody there talks about God.

24:53.990 --> 24:56.288
Like he's some uncle
hiding in the attic.

24:56.320 --> 24:58.288
Drives you crazy.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.286
Do you believe in God?

25:00.330 --> 25:04.096
Yeah, but even I don't
like talking about it.

25:04.130 --> 25:06.166
I don't like pretending
to be someone I'm not

25:06.200 --> 25:08.031
when I'm being interviewed.

25:08.070 --> 25:10.163
Really?
You're good at it.

25:12.010 --> 25:14.535
Your Honor, it was one quarter
of a mile outside of Illinois.

25:14.580 --> 25:16.775
It doesn't matter if it was
one mile or a hundred miles.

25:16.810 --> 25:18.300
Yes, it does.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.568
This is the kind of minutia
that makes the law insane.

25:20.620 --> 25:24.078
Cary drove ten minutes from his
home to a Harvard get-together.

25:24.120 --> 25:27.044
The route just happened to
take him outside of the state.

25:27.090 --> 25:29.558
Yes, and I just acted
as ASA on five bail hearings

25:29.590 --> 25:31.729
where the ball was revoked due
to Similarly picayune reasons.

25:31.760 --> 25:33.591
And the only reason
that we're debating this is

25:33.630 --> 25:36.599
because Mr. Agos went to
a Harvard mixer, and he's white.

25:36.630 --> 25:38.029
This is_ not
a race issue.

25:38.070 --> 25:39.025
Oh, it is,
actually.

25:39.070 --> 25:41.038
Your Honor...
No!

25:41.070 --> 25:43.231
I talk now.

25:43.270 --> 25:45.204
_ There was_a man
just in here in tears,

25:45.240 --> 25:46.764
but I had to revoke his bail

25:46.810 --> 25:48.732
because he went
to his child's birthday.

25:48.780 --> 25:51.772
So, yeah, I agree Mr. Agos,
it is a minor offense,

25:51.810 --> 25:53.619
but the law
is the law.

25:53.650 --> 25:56.619
Now, how long will it take you
to finish your report,

25:56.650 --> 25:58.914
Miss, uh... Lucy?
I mean, Miss...

25:58.950 --> 26:00.247
You.

26:00.290 --> 26:01.985
24 hours.

26:02.020 --> 26:04.329
Good, advise me on how to modify
the bail restrictions,

26:04.360 --> 26:06.055
and then I'll make my decision.

26:06.090 --> 26:08.149
That's it.

26:08.200 --> 26:09.997
ALICIA:
Good morning.

26:10.030 --> 26:11.793
Morning.

26:11.830 --> 26:12.865
Hi.

26:12.900 --> 26:13.867
What's up?

26:13.900 --> 26:16.368
Not much, why?

26:16.400 --> 26:18.004
Have you heard this song
I heard on the radio?

26:18.040 --> 26:19.359
"Call Me Maybe"?

26:19.410 --> 26:20.365
Yeah.

26:20.410 --> 26:22.002
I like it.

26:22.040 --> 26:23.029
Is it popular?

26:23.080 --> 26:25.742
It... it was, a few years ago.

26:25.780 --> 26:28.078
Guess I'm late to everything.

26:28.120 --> 26:30.008
I just, I can't get it
out of my head.

26:30.050 --> 26:32.644
* Hey, I just met you

26:32.690 --> 26:35.079
* And this is crazy...

26:40.030 --> 26:41.327
(humming)

26:44.100 --> 26:45.761
You're good, right?

26:45.800 --> 26:47.324
Oh, yeah.

26:47.370 --> 26:49.235
Me?

26:50.440 --> 26:52.067
Oh, yeah.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.379
Stanley Pronovost.

26:55.410 --> 26:56.877
I'm an analyst in the CIA's

26:56.910 --> 26:59.049
Directorate of Science
and Technology.

26:59.080 --> 27:01.116
Mr. Pronovost, are you familiar
with the DelCheck app

27:01.150 --> 27:03.118
designed by J-serve,
the defendant's company?

27:03.150 --> 27:05.141
Yes.

27:05.190 --> 27:06.919
And have you analyzed
the app's decryption code?

27:06.950 --> 27:08.315
I have.

27:08.360 --> 27:10.214
Now, have you seen this
decryption code anywhere else?

27:10.260 --> 27:11.989
Yes, last month.

27:12.030 --> 27:14.396
Kid on my staff came across
a program out of Beijing

27:14.430 --> 27:15.829
with the exact same code.

27:15.860 --> 27:18.090
And to whom did
this program belong?

27:18.130 --> 27:20.394
The MSS, China's CIA.

27:20.430 --> 27:23.092
And how could the MSS
use this program?

27:23.140 --> 27:24.869
It'd be like a Swiss
army knife for hackers.

27:24.910 --> 27:26.832
They could break into
almost any database.

27:26.870 --> 27:28.701
Banks, brokerage
houses.

27:28.740 --> 27:30.173
Even stock exchanges.

27:30.210 --> 27:33.247
You want me?

27:33.280 --> 27:36.113
This is a young firm,
with young partners.

27:36.150 --> 27:38.846
You bring experience,
wisdom.

27:38.890 --> 27:41.313
You have a lot to
teach people, Howard.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.851
Well, this is...
bit out of the blue.

27:43.890 --> 27:45.858
Well, when one is
pursuing excellence,

27:45.890 --> 27:47.721
does timing really matter?

27:47.760 --> 27:51.025
The last time someone
tried to woo me was 1958.

27:51.070 --> 27:53.288
Farrow & McDaniel.
(laughs)

27:53.330 --> 27:56.231
Good thing I said no--
they went belly up in '59.

27:56.270 --> 27:58.238
Well, if you'd said yes,
maybe they'd still be around.

27:58.270 --> 27:59.862
Aha!

27:59.910 --> 28:01.878
Want more money.

28:01.910 --> 28:03.878
Howard,

28:03.910 --> 28:06.276
you know this isn't about money
for somebody like you.

28:06.310 --> 28:08.244
Come on, it's about
being in court.

28:08.280 --> 28:11.078
(cell phone rings)
It's about the rush
of cross-examination.

28:11.120 --> 28:13.953
Canning and David Lee, they
won't let you argue in court.

28:13.990 --> 28:15.958
They don't
believe in you.

28:15.990 --> 28:17.457
We do.

28:17.490 --> 28:19.458
Okay, so you want any app sold
to the Chinese?

28:19.490 --> 28:22.129
We think the Feds
are overreaching here.

28:22.160 --> 28:23.991
The Chinese could've gotten
the encryption code

28:24.030 --> 28:25.964
from any civilian-purchased app.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.262
Okay, I'm on it, um...

28:27.300 --> 28:29.393
How's Cary doing?

28:29.440 --> 28:30.395
How's he...?

28:30.440 --> 28:31.407
What?

28:31.440 --> 28:32.407
Why? What do you mean?

28:32.440 --> 28:33.839
The spot-check last night.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.279
I haven't seen him here.

28:35.310 --> 28:36.277
Uh... what?

28:36.310 --> 28:38.972
He was re-arrested last night.

28:40.850 --> 28:42.272
GRUBICK:
Miss Sharma?
Yep.

28:42.320 --> 28:44.117
I'm Joy Grubick.

28:44.150 --> 28:49.087
I'm Mr. Agos's pretrial
services officer.

28:49.120 --> 28:52.283
You have a few minutes to talk?

28:59.300 --> 29:02.064
So... yes!

29:05.210 --> 29:07.030
You are the _firm's
private investigator?

29:07.070 --> 29:08.207
Yes, I am.

29:10.810 --> 29:15.270
And before that,
you held a similar position

29:15.320 --> 29:17.538
with Lockhart/Gardner.

29:17.580 --> 29:19.286
Or was it Lockhart/
Gardner/Canning?

29:19.320 --> 29:20.287
Wait, no, um...

29:20.320 --> 29:21.287
Both of them.

29:21.320 --> 29:24.289
And, yes,
I worked there.

29:25.390 --> 29:28.097
Yes.

29:28.130 --> 29:31.361
Uh, do you work
closely with Mr. Agos?

29:31.400 --> 29:34.335
Yes.

29:34.370 --> 29:39.262
And does your relationship
extend to the personal?

29:39.310 --> 29:41.301
We're friends.

29:46.080 --> 29:48.071
Um...

29:48.120 --> 29:52.409
In 2012, uh...

29:52.450 --> 29:55.385
you were arrested...

29:55.420 --> 29:57.411
for harassing a juror.

29:57.460 --> 30:00.429
Well, the charge
was dropped.

30:00.460 --> 30:03.918
But you were arrested?

30:03.970 --> 30:05.961
Yeah.

30:07.400 --> 30:10.392
2011? Yes, '11.

30:14.410 --> 30:17.436
You were the subject
of a grand jury hearing

30:17.480 --> 30:20.142
for the beating
of a witness,

30:20.180 --> 30:22.614
a psychologist
named Dr. Booth?

30:22.650 --> 30:24.379
Well, there was
no indictment.

30:24.420 --> 30:26.285
I'd never met
Dr. Booth.

30:32.160 --> 30:34.151
Mm...

30:37.530 --> 30:39.623
So, have you worked for Mr. Agos

30:39.670 --> 30:41.865
on any of the
Lemond Bishop cases?

30:43.910 --> 30:47.164
Yes, for Alicia Florrick
and Diane Lockhart.

30:47.210 --> 30:49.371
So, I'm assuming that, uh...

30:49.410 --> 30:52.345
you have regular interaction
with, uh, Mr. Bishop?

30:52.380 --> 30:54.211
Had.

30:54.250 --> 30:56.218
He's no longer a client.

30:56.250 --> 30:58.514
Oh.

30:58.550 --> 31:00.518
Uh...

31:00.550 --> 31:03.257
Well, what about
Mr. Bishop's employees?

31:03.290 --> 31:04.552
Might you interact
with them?

31:04.590 --> 31:06.581
Of his legitimate
businesses, yes.

31:09.430 --> 31:12.126
You have an opinion...

31:12.170 --> 31:16.288
on whether Mr. Agos is fit
for further bail release?

31:16.340 --> 31:17.489
I do.

31:17.540 --> 31:20.202
He's the most
honest person I know.

31:20.240 --> 31:22.936
And his re-arrest is a testament

31:22.980 --> 31:26.939
to the inadequacies of the Cook
County system, not of Cary Agos.

31:33.690 --> 31:35.487
* I threw a wish in the well

31:35.520 --> 31:37.215
* Don't ask me,
I'll never tell *

31:37.260 --> 31:38.625
* I looked to you as it fell

31:38.660 --> 31:41.049
* And now you're in my way

31:41.100 --> 31:43.398
* Hey, I just met you

31:43.430 --> 31:45.489
* And this is crazy

31:45.530 --> 31:47.566
* But here's my number

31:50.070 --> 31:52.163
* And all the other boys...

31:52.210 --> 31:53.404
No, no, no.

31:53.440 --> 31:55.374
It's not what you think.
Fantasia!

31:55.410 --> 31:58.140
She's gone,
she let me in.

31:58.180 --> 31:59.977
You need to go.

32:00.010 --> 32:02.069
I couldn't stand it when you
said you were married in court.

32:02.120 --> 32:03.212
Well, I was married.

32:03.250 --> 32:04.581
I wanted to yell
right there.

32:04.620 --> 32:05.985
Why?

32:06.020 --> 32:07.282
'Cause...

32:07.320 --> 32:08.548
I looked at you.

32:08.590 --> 32:09.682
* Your stare was holding

32:09.720 --> 32:12.154
* Ripped jeans,
skin was showin' *

32:12.190 --> 32:14.124
* Hot night, wind was blowin'

32:14.160 --> 32:16.958
* Where you think
you're goin', baby? *
Oh, no.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.968
* Hey, I just met you

32:19.000 --> 32:20.968
* And this is crazy

32:21.000 --> 32:22.968
* But here's my number

32:25.010 --> 32:27.001
* It's hard to look right

32:27.040 --> 32:31.147
Um... I-I really need
to work out more.

32:31.180 --> 32:33.148
No, I used to be a lot skinnier.

32:33.180 --> 32:35.569
You are the most
beautiful woman I've ever met.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.349
* And this is crazy

32:37.380 --> 32:38.449
* But here's my number

32:39.650 --> 32:42.016
We're in court together.

32:42.060 --> 32:43.948
(gasps)

32:44.790 --> 32:47.327
Baby lotion.

32:47.360 --> 32:48.588
Dear God.

32:48.630 --> 32:51.190
I couldn't get the smell of you
out of my mind.

32:51.230 --> 32:53.323
Damn your Old Spice to hell.

32:53.370 --> 32:54.632
Oh.

32:54.670 --> 32:57.662
* I missed you so, so bad...

33:01.780 --> 33:03.600
Thank you, God,
for all your blessings.

33:03.640 --> 33:06.074
Thank you for tonight
and for being with friends.

33:06.110 --> 33:09.216
And for stimulating
conversation.

33:09.250 --> 33:12.617
And for your great Word.

33:12.650 --> 33:15.585
We're especially thankful
tonight for Grace.

33:15.620 --> 33:18.282
She has done
something extraordinary

33:18.330 --> 33:20.582
in the last 24 hours, Jesus.

33:20.630 --> 33:23.019
She has reached her mother.

33:23.060 --> 33:25.563
Her mom is finally
listening to her.

33:25.600 --> 33:27.420
Her mom,
whose heart was hardened,

33:27.470 --> 33:29.267
has finally come around.

33:29.300 --> 33:31.609
So I want us all
to take Grace's example

33:31.640 --> 33:34.131
and never give up
on our loved ones.

33:34.180 --> 33:35.533
Thank you, Grace.

33:35.580 --> 33:37.605
In Jesus' name we pray.
Amen.

33:37.640 --> 33:39.608
ALL:
Amen.

33:39.650 --> 33:42.210
So what did you say, Grace,
that made your mom listen?

33:42.250 --> 33:44.514
Um, well, you know,
she's still struggling.

33:44.550 --> 33:46.438
We all are.

33:46.490 --> 33:49.516
The important thing is she
opened the door even an inch.

33:49.560 --> 33:52.757
And you opened
that door.

33:56.600 --> 33:57.692
DIANE:
Hello, gentlemen.

33:57.730 --> 34:00.392
How'd you get past reception?

34:00.430 --> 34:02.068
I let them in.
What now, Diane?

34:02.100 --> 34:03.533
I'm here about my lease.

34:03.570 --> 34:04.707
Page 24, paragraph 18D.

34:04.740 --> 34:06.537
(David chuckles)

34:06.570 --> 34:08.629
You thinkjust showing up
counts as physical presence?

34:08.680 --> 34:10.568
There's not a court
in the land...

34:10.610 --> 34:13.704
Actually, no. We're talking
about paragraph 18D.

34:13.750 --> 34:16.173
If the leaseholder
is unable to be

34:16.220 --> 34:17.642
physically on the premises,

34:17.680 --> 34:19.147
said obligation
may be fulfilled

34:19.190 --> 34:21.158
by his or her proxy.

34:21.190 --> 34:22.555
Say hello to his

34:22.590 --> 34:23.784
or her proxy.

34:23.820 --> 34:25.651
You hired him?

34:25.690 --> 34:27.851
It's your final eviction notice.

34:27.890 --> 34:29.858
You have 24 hours.

34:29.900 --> 34:33.495
HOWARD: My physical
presence and I

34:33.530 --> 34:37.091
will be in my office,
should you need me.

34:37.140 --> 34:38.368
KALINDA:
HI.

34:38.410 --> 34:39.365
Kalinda, anything on
the other apps?

34:39.410 --> 34:40.707
ELSBETH:
Hi, Kalinda.

34:40.740 --> 34:42.628
It's Elsbeth, too.
KALINDA: Hi, Elsbeth.

34:42.680 --> 34:45.740
No, um, nothing with
any kind of decryption code.

34:45.780 --> 34:48.419
But, in 2002,
the same Chinese company

34:48.450 --> 34:49.872
bought a firewall program

34:49.920 --> 34:52.741
from a Boston firm by the name
of Cunneyworth Dunlap.

34:52.790 --> 34:54.212
Cunneyworth? What is that?

34:54.260 --> 34:55.818
It's a CIA front company.

34:55.860 --> 34:57.748
You're kidding.

34:57.790 --> 34:59.621
No. They had to close shop

34:59.660 --> 35:01.651
a few months later
after their name appeared

35:01.700 --> 35:04.191
in news_stories about_
the Valerie Plame affair.

35:04.230 --> 35:05.720
ALICIA: Okay, well,
we can argue double standard,

35:05.770 --> 35:07.897
that the US. government
did the same thing

35:07.930 --> 35:09.761
they're accusing J-Serve of.
ELSBETH:
Do you have any documentation?

35:09.800 --> 35:11.904
I'm trying to get my hands
on an invoice,

35:11.940 --> 35:13.828
but it's gonna take some time.
ALICIA:
We'll ask for a further delay.

35:13.870 --> 35:16.338
KALIN DA: Okay.
No.

35:18.480 --> 35:19.674
Yes, Elsbeth?

35:19.710 --> 35:21.177
No.

35:21.220 --> 35:22.642
I think there might be
another way.

35:22.680 --> 35:24.682
What other way?

35:24.720 --> 35:27.484
I've got his buttons.

35:27.520 --> 35:28.509
(phone beeps)

35:36.960 --> 35:38.666
Are you all right?

35:38.700 --> 35:40.395
Yeah. Why?

35:40.430 --> 35:42.239
I heard about last night.

35:42.270 --> 35:44.158
Yeah. 800 yards into Indiana,
and I'm a felon again.

35:44.210 --> 35:45.563
Well, we're here
for you, Cary.

35:45.610 --> 35:48.636
I know we've had
our differences about work,

35:48.680 --> 35:51.205
but anything you need,
we're here.

35:51.250 --> 35:52.945
I think it's best I
take a break from work.

35:52.980 --> 35:54.470
No.

35:54.520 --> 35:55.669
Alicia, they're
coming after me,

35:55.720 --> 35:57.711
and whatever I do,
I'm an anvil here.

35:57.750 --> 35:59.547
No.

35:59.590 --> 36:01.808
We do this together.

36:01.860 --> 36:03.919
(sighs)

36:03.960 --> 36:05.848
Okay.

36:07.760 --> 36:09.728
After further interviews,
this officer concludes

36:09.760 --> 36:12.695
that the bail infraction
was inadvertent.

36:12.730 --> 36:17.690
But the officer also concludes
that Mr. Agos has been

36:17.740 --> 36:21.437
casual in his conformity
to judicial rulings.

36:21.480 --> 36:24.574
Therefore, we advise
further restrictions on bail.

36:24.610 --> 36:26.771
What restrictions?

36:26.810 --> 36:28.744
Ankle monitoring bracelet

36:28.780 --> 36:30.668
and a 9:00 curfew.

36:30.720 --> 36:33.484
Your Honor, lawyer hours would
make this highly impractical.

36:33.520 --> 36:35.249
That's unfortunate.
I don't care.

36:35.290 --> 36:36.450
What else, Ms. Grubick?

36:36.490 --> 36:39.948
No contact with
the firm investigator

36:39.990 --> 36:41.799
Kalinda Sharma.

36:41.830 --> 36:44.321
I'm sorry, what?
Uh, 725 ILCS

36:44.370 --> 36:48.932
185 prohibits interaction with
anyone considered dangerous.

36:48.970 --> 36:50.528
JUDGE:
Why is she dangerous?

36:50.570 --> 36:51.832
Prior arrests,

36:51.870 --> 36:56.273
a grand jury charge
and contact with Lemond Bishop.

36:56.310 --> 36:58.346
DIANE: This is unacceptable,
Your Honor. Ms. Sharma is

36:58.380 --> 37:01.008
an integral part of the
operation of Mr. Agos's firm.

37:01.050 --> 37:05.589
Yes, and Kalinda Sharma works
closely on Mr. Agos's cases,

37:05.620 --> 37:08.783
as well as being
a social, uh, acquaintance,

37:08.820 --> 37:12.824
but my report advises that the
court's rulings are paramount.

37:12.860 --> 37:14.828
JUDGE: ASA Polmar, do you agree
with these added restrictions?

37:14.860 --> 37:16.748
We do, Your Honor.
All right.

37:16.800 --> 37:18.392
The bail is approved,

37:18.430 --> 37:20.022
but only with these
further restrictions applying.

37:20.070 --> 37:22.391
And if you break the rules
again, young man,

37:22.440 --> 37:23.759
your bail will be revoked,

37:23.800 --> 37:25.028
and you'll spend the
rest of your time

37:25.070 --> 37:26.765
until trial behind bars.

37:32.810 --> 37:34.778
(door opens)
Hi.

37:34.820 --> 37:36.811
(chuckles):
Hi.

37:43.320 --> 37:45.288
Here are your buttons.
Oh. (chuckles)

37:45.330 --> 37:48.299
Thank you.
Oh, and here...

37:48.330 --> 37:50.821
is one of yours I found
in my hair this morning.

37:50.860 --> 37:52.669
(chuckles)

37:52.700 --> 37:56.295
That song's been
in my head.

37:56.340 --> 37:56.931
Mm...

37:56.970 --> 37:58.562
Actually, I'm here for work.

37:58.610 --> 37:59.861
Oh.

37:59.910 --> 38:02.071
One of our investigators,
Kalinda Sharma,

38:02.110 --> 38:06.900
found an invoice from
a CIA shell company

38:06.950 --> 38:09.009
that sold firewall software

38:09.050 --> 38:10.915
to everyone's favorite
Chinese company.

38:10.950 --> 38:14.716
I think the judge would love to
hear how the Justice Department

38:14.760 --> 38:16.387
is selectively prosecuting us.

38:16.420 --> 38:20.652
Mm. I take it you have an
original invoice as proof.

38:20.690 --> 38:22.328
I do indeed.

38:22.360 --> 38:23.918
Huh.

38:23.960 --> 38:27.964
How do I know you're not faking?

38:39.710 --> 38:40.699
Uh-huh.

38:40.750 --> 38:42.775
Well...

38:44.720 --> 38:46.745
Yeah.

38:46.790 --> 38:48.917
(Elsbeth gasps,
shredder whirring)

38:48.960 --> 38:50.916
That was evidence!

38:50.960 --> 38:51.927
Yes.

38:51.960 --> 38:53.518
And now it's gone.

38:53.560 --> 38:55.619
What you just did is illegal.

38:55.660 --> 38:57.696
No, what you think I
just did was illegal.

38:57.730 --> 38:59.095
You just dropped it
in your shredder.

38:59.130 --> 39:01.894
(sighs) Yes. I'm sorry.

39:01.940 --> 39:05.535
So... last night
didn't matter to you?

39:05.570 --> 39:07.037
It did.

39:07.070 --> 39:08.435
But work is work.

39:10.080 --> 39:15.677
So you are fully aware that
you just destroyed evidence,

39:15.720 --> 39:20.043
Assistant United States Attorney
Josh Perotti,

39:20.090 --> 39:21.887
at 9:47 am.

39:21.920 --> 39:23.615
Nice try, Elsbeth.

39:23.660 --> 39:25.389
But that recording
is inadmissible.

39:25.430 --> 39:27.057
It requires
two-party consent.

39:27.090 --> 39:29.854
Well, then you need to spend
more time in Illinois

39:29.900 --> 39:33.165
and less in DC, because
this state's Supreme Court

39:33.200 --> 39:36.169
recently struck down
the two-party consent law.

39:36.200 --> 39:39.033
I only need one party.

39:39.070 --> 39:40.833
And that's me.

39:40.870 --> 39:44.806
And I, oh... I consent.

39:46.810 --> 39:48.448
(phone beeps)

39:51.590 --> 39:54.559
So... call me.

39:54.590 --> 39:56.581
Maybe.

40:02.160 --> 40:04.799
Are you sure about this,
Mr. Perotti?
Yes, Your Honor.

40:04.830 --> 40:07.628
We are withdrawing all charges
against J-Serve

40:07.670 --> 40:08.932
and Camilla Vargas.

40:08.970 --> 40:11.188
The Justice Department
considers this matter closed.

40:11.240 --> 40:12.605
JUDGE:
Okay, then.

40:12.640 --> 40:15.131
This was a supreme waste
of time.

40:15.180 --> 40:16.909
(gavelbangs)
In your opinion?

40:16.940 --> 40:18.771
CAMILLA:
Thank you, both.

40:18.810 --> 40:21.973
Now we can go back to suing you
for $23 million.

40:22.020 --> 40:23.908
Oh, I can't wait.

40:23.950 --> 40:25.486
See you in court.

40:34.830 --> 40:36.798
You shouldn't have done it.

40:36.830 --> 40:37.956
You shouldn't
have either.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.889
Are you heading out?

40:40.930 --> 40:43.990
Yeah, back to DC.

40:44.040 --> 40:46.167
Bye, Elsbeth.

40:48.210 --> 40:49.871
Good-bye, Josh.

40:58.120 --> 41:00.543
(sniffing)

41:01.290 --> 41:03.212
(elevator bell dings)

41:07.930 --> 41:09.921
You've got to
be kidding me.

41:13.070 --> 41:15.038
DIANE: Well, the first order
of business

41:15.070 --> 41:16.594
is replacing that.

41:24.950 --> 41:27.976
They removed
the "F," the "A," and the "L."

41:28.010 --> 41:29.216
Subﬂe.

41:29.250 --> 41:30.911
(laughs)

41:36.690 --> 41:39.659
Well, Cary says he's fine
with David Lee's office,

41:39.690 --> 41:41.658
so I guess this
is you and me.

41:51.840 --> 41:54.968
No, take mine.

41:55.010 --> 41:57.228
No, Diane.

41:59.810 --> 42:01.209
I could use
a fresh start.

42:01.250 --> 42:04.742
You take my office.

42:04.790 --> 42:07.042
I won't hear of it.

42:17.030 --> 42:19.021
