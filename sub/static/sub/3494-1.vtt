So how is this guy?
Nice guy or is he going to be trouble?

02:26.090 --> 02:28.456
He's a real sweetheart, Manny.

02:28.526 --> 02:29.993
Just like you.

02:34.564 --> 02:36.998
Who the fuck are you, huh?
You got my clothes?

02:37.067 --> 02:38.763
Where's my clothes, huh?
You got my clothes?

02:38.836 --> 02:40.826
Where is this? Is this some kind of joke?
Don't keep that door locked.

02:40.904 --> 02:42.565
You guys are lucky I didn't
break that door down.

02:42.639 --> 02:44.300
Okay listen, I didn't do
anything to that girl.

02:44.374 --> 02:46.308
That was my friend,
he was stupid and I didn't touch her.

02:46.376 --> 02:48.173
so I don't know
why the fuck I'm here, okay?

02:48.245 --> 02:50.509
Wherever the fuck here is.
Where-- where am l?

02:50.580 --> 02:54.914
Emilio Manrique, you are
in south Miami Mental Hospital

02:54.985 --> 02:56.451
and I am here to help you out.

02:56.519 --> 02:58.283
Mental hospital?
I'm not crazy. I'm not the--

02:58.355 --> 03:00.289
will you keep me here forever
with the crazy people?

03:00.357 --> 03:02.916
I'm not the one that's crazy, okay?
Don't look at me like that!

03:02.992 --> 03:04.516
Because I'm fine!
Okay, I'm fine!

03:04.593 --> 03:07.324
Look at me-- I'm fine.
I'm not-- I'm not crazy, okay?

03:07.397 --> 03:10.160
And I'm a good person. You've got
to believe me, what I tell you,

03:10.232 --> 03:11.597
- I'm fine!
- Go ahead.

03:11.667 --> 03:13.862
- I've never felt better.
- Go ahead.

03:15.438 --> 03:16.995
That's it, go ahead.

03:17.072 --> 03:18.700
I'm here to help.
Go ahead and let it all out.

03:18.774 --> 03:22.005
Don't fucking tell me
to let it all out!

03:22.078 --> 03:25.604
Because I will!
I'll fucking sacrifice it all.

03:25.680 --> 03:27.842
Ahh!

03:27.917 --> 03:31.181
- Don't you-- hey!
- Hold it.

03:31.252 --> 03:34.187
Ah!
You motherfuckers!

03:34.255 --> 03:37.350
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

03:37.426 --> 03:38.517
No!

03:40.762 --> 03:42.889
My name's Emilio.

03:42.964 --> 03:45.796
This is where
my story begins.

03:45.866 --> 03:47.664
I was born and raised in Miami,

03:47.736 --> 03:50.364
the city that's known
for its tropical beaches,

03:50.438 --> 03:52.065
clear blue skies--

03:52.140 --> 03:54.300
the playground
for the rich and famous.

03:54.375 --> 03:57.038
You know, all that stuff
you see on TV.

03:57.112 --> 03:59.137
Well, I'm not from around there.

03:59.214 --> 04:01.875
I'm from that part of Miami
that nobody even knows exists.

04:22.101 --> 04:24.729
Hey, be careful.
Don't break Beto's house.

04:24.804 --> 04:26.500
Yeah, right, I'm a millionaire.

04:26.573 --> 04:29.735
Nigga, you so broke
you can't even afford to pay attention.

04:29.809 --> 04:32.073
Come on, serge.
Do I have to do it?

04:32.145 --> 04:34.636
You lost, E.
You know the rules.

04:34.714 --> 04:36.341
Damn, it's hot as hell
today, you know?

04:36.416 --> 04:38.611
I need some water.
I'm fuckin' dehydrating over here.

04:38.684 --> 04:40.811
That's 'cause
you're 50 lbs overweight.

04:40.887 --> 04:43.684
- Hurry up, E. Let's do this.
- How does paper beat rock?

04:43.755 --> 04:45.416
Am I the first person
to think about that?

04:45.490 --> 04:48.585
I mean, scissors beats paper,
'cause you can just cut the paper.

04:48.661 --> 04:52.756
But paper doesn't beat rock
'cause you can't cut a rock.

04:52.831 --> 04:53.923
What you mean
you can't cut a rock?

04:53.999 --> 04:55.626
Your mama be doing that
every night.

04:57.170 --> 04:59.160
E, if you're scared, I'll do it.

04:59.237 --> 05:01.330
I ain't scared of shit!

05:01.406 --> 05:04.603
Then let's do this.

05:18.723 --> 05:20.189
Almost ready, mi amor.

05:20.257 --> 05:22.919
Mama, you don't have to cook
me breakfast every morning.

05:22.993 --> 05:25.188
Mi amor, it's the most
important meal of the day.

05:25.262 --> 05:27.389
Okay? I want to make sure
that you start your day off right.

05:27.465 --> 05:28.955
You're not eating?
sit down.

05:29.033 --> 05:31.365
I know.
I don't eat breakfast.

05:31.435 --> 05:33.198
I don't have time.

05:33.270 --> 05:36.171
Yeah, did they turn the water off
in her apartment again?

05:36.240 --> 05:37.673
I don't know.

05:37.741 --> 05:39.800
Mami, don't give her
any more money.

05:39.877 --> 05:42.106
Mami, mami, mami, you know
what she's going to do with it.

05:42.178 --> 05:43.941
Do you want more platanos?

05:44.013 --> 05:47.108
she doesn't appreciate a goddamn thing
you do for her or for Emilio.

05:47.184 --> 05:49.447
Frank, God's last name
is not "damn."

05:49.519 --> 05:51.680
I'm sorry.
I worry about Emilio.

05:51.754 --> 05:53.153
I do too.

05:53.223 --> 05:55.885
Oye, hey.

05:55.959 --> 05:59.053
When you're done there,
can you give me a ride home?

05:59.129 --> 06:00.960
- Okay. That looks really good.
- sure.

06:01.030 --> 06:04.362
Mi vida, por favor,
you're getting the carpet all wet.

06:04.433 --> 06:06.698
Why don't you
go and dry off in the bathroom?

06:06.769 --> 06:08.794
Relax, Daisy.
It's just water.

06:08.872 --> 06:10.498
It'll dry.

06:13.242 --> 06:15.711
Okay okay!
iEsta bien!

06:15.778 --> 06:17.039
God!

06:17.112 --> 06:19.046
If it's not one thing,
it's the other!

06:19.114 --> 06:20.741
If not, it's something else!

06:20.816 --> 06:21.840
iMia!

06:21.917 --> 06:24.476
It's just water!
My God!

06:24.552 --> 06:26.646
It's just water!

06:34.529 --> 06:37.795
so can you take me home?
I got this job-interview thing.

06:37.866 --> 06:39.890
I said sure.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.268
Where's Emilio?

06:45.773 --> 06:47.400
Oh my God,
the kid's in the road!

06:47.475 --> 06:48.772
Hold on, hold on,
stay here. Hold on.

06:48.843 --> 06:50.401
- Oh my God!
- stay here, stay here.

06:55.183 --> 06:56.445
Hey, kid, are you okay?

06:57.985 --> 06:59.475
Robert!

06:59.554 --> 07:01.145
shut up or I'll crack your skull!

07:01.221 --> 07:03.280
You're lucky to get jacked
by the Jack Boys.

07:03.356 --> 07:04.414
Robert!

07:04.491 --> 07:06.153
Hey, little mama,
don't worry about Robert.

07:06.227 --> 07:07.659
- What are you doing? Robert!
- He's gonna be fine.

07:07.727 --> 07:09.786
- We're the Jack Boys!
- You got a wallet?

07:09.863 --> 07:12.024
Let me out!

07:12.098 --> 07:15.556
Damn, bro, it's dangerous to be carrying
this much money around with you.

07:15.635 --> 07:17.125
- Robert!
- Hey hey, sit back.

07:17.204 --> 07:18.364
- Let--
- Don't touch me.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.497
I'm gonna hang on to this,
keep it safe for you.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.302
A lot of thugs
in this neighborhood.

07:22.374 --> 07:24.308
- He'll get the shit kicked out of him.
- Get off my car!

07:24.377 --> 07:27.107
All right, Mr. White Man.
Pleasure doing business with you.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.443
All right, little mama. Keep it
nice and tight. I'll call you later.

07:29.515 --> 07:30.709
Ha ha!

07:30.783 --> 07:32.216
Robert!

07:32.284 --> 07:34.253
You know, if you want,
you could stay with me

07:34.321 --> 07:36.686
- for a couple of weeks.
- Frank, with you?

07:36.755 --> 07:38.985
Please.
You live in a boxing gym.

07:39.058 --> 07:40.685
Thanks, pero no thank you.

07:40.759 --> 07:43.522
Boxing is all about discipline.
Maybe he could use a little--

07:43.595 --> 07:45.791
Maybe he could what?
Become a boxer like you?

07:45.864 --> 07:48.992
I don't think so. I'd rather him
flip burgers than become a boxer.

07:49.068 --> 07:51.968
- Boxing is a waste of time.
- Okay okay okay, I understand.

07:53.438 --> 07:55.304
Besides, we can take care
of him just fine, all right?

07:55.374 --> 07:56.534
"We"?

07:56.609 --> 07:58.371
Excuse me?

07:58.443 --> 08:00.775
- You just said we.
- Yeah.

08:00.845 --> 08:02.642
Don't tell me Tomas
is staying with you again.

08:02.714 --> 08:04.046
No.

08:05.750 --> 08:07.980
Well, he--

08:08.052 --> 08:10.179
he just comes over
once in a while, all right?

08:10.255 --> 08:11.915
We're trying to work things out.

08:11.989 --> 08:14.390
Lydia, do you realize what
you're doing to your son's life?

08:14.459 --> 08:16.791
You're just jealous!
You are not his father, Frank.

08:16.861 --> 08:19.488
Okay? You're just
an old, lonely man.

08:19.563 --> 08:21.394
- That's what you are.
- Yeah yeah, I'm jealous.

08:21.465 --> 08:23.433
You're jealous of what
me and Tomas have. Yeah!

08:23.500 --> 08:25.093
Yeah, I'm jealous.
You know what? You're crazy.

08:25.169 --> 08:26.726
- Oh, I'm crazy?
- Yeah, you're crazy.

08:26.803 --> 08:29.067
- I'm the crazy one.
- You're crazy. You're crazy.

08:29.139 --> 08:31.471
si, loca. Yeah, don't forget
about what you did, okay?

08:31.541 --> 08:33.565
Okay, you have
no right to judge me.

08:35.679 --> 08:38.443
Mami, I'm sorry.

08:38.515 --> 08:39.880
It's okay.

08:39.950 --> 08:43.214
Mami, mami.

08:43.285 --> 08:45.346
What about my ride?

08:45.422 --> 08:48.481
Jack boys, Jack boys,
what you gonna do?

08:48.557 --> 08:50.821
What you gonna do
when we come for you?

08:50.893 --> 08:53.727
Oh, you know a lot
of folk got a dream

08:53.797 --> 08:56.629
- And you know I am so very mean...
- Y-yeah!

08:56.699 --> 08:59.293
Oh, you know
that I show my power

08:59.368 --> 09:01.666
Every day
and every fuckin' hour.

09:01.737 --> 09:03.261
Yeah yeah!

09:03.339 --> 09:05.500
Hey, I think that lady
liked me, you know?

09:05.574 --> 09:07.269
I could tell by the way
she was looking at me.

09:07.343 --> 09:08.901
That was bad.
You see how I pulled up?

09:08.978 --> 09:10.740
- Mm-hmm.
- He was so scared!

09:10.812 --> 09:12.871
- Yeah.
- I could have took his girl too,

09:12.947 --> 09:14.939
- right in front of him.
- That's what I'm talkin' about.

09:15.017 --> 09:16.575
Whoo hoo!

09:19.220 --> 09:20.585
Wallet!

09:20.655 --> 09:22.589
Yo, how much did we make?

09:22.657 --> 09:24.215
"We"?

09:24.292 --> 09:25.554
What you mean, we?

09:25.627 --> 09:27.390
Nigga, you must be crazy.

09:27.462 --> 09:29.396
I just bought all these beers.

09:29.464 --> 09:32.227
And I'm the one that always
brings the weed and shit.

09:32.299 --> 09:34.393
And I'm the one that makes sure
that nothing happens

09:34.469 --> 09:37.404
to you little motherfuckers
while you out here.

09:37.472 --> 09:40.065
Yo, E, it's all you, big dog.

09:40.140 --> 09:42.871
Nah, I just need some water
or something. It's hot out here.

09:42.944 --> 09:45.003
Hey, I'll take it.

09:52.920 --> 09:54.717
What the hell is that?

09:55.756 --> 09:57.781
This?

09:57.858 --> 09:59.519
Take it...

09:59.593 --> 10:01.389
just in case anything
happened to you.

10:01.461 --> 10:02.793
I'll show you.

10:02.863 --> 10:05.331
You just push this lever
in and out

10:05.399 --> 10:07.332
when you're ready
to stick someone.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.061
- Trust me.
- All right, serge.

10:09.135 --> 10:10.159
You bet.

10:13.140 --> 10:15.073
What the fuck is this?

10:15.141 --> 10:16.608
You eating dog food now?

10:16.676 --> 10:18.610
Is that why your breath
always smell like shit?

10:18.678 --> 10:20.771
Give me that fuckin' thing.

10:20.847 --> 10:22.781
Yo, we got company.

10:26.152 --> 10:28.949
I told you dirty Haitians,
don't you come around here.

10:29.020 --> 10:30.351
- This is my bridge.
- Fuck you!

10:30.422 --> 10:31.889
We go wherever
the fuck we wanna go.

10:31.957 --> 10:33.949
Why don't you take
your fuckin' ass back to Haiti?

10:34.026 --> 10:37.119
- I was born here, stupid ass.
- Who the fuck you callin' stupid ass?

10:37.195 --> 10:39.095
You think we scared?

10:39.164 --> 10:41.132
Fuck!

10:43.969 --> 10:46.494
Do it, E!
Do it! Kill him!

10:56.214 --> 10:58.408
- How was school?
- Fine, Mom.

10:58.482 --> 11:00.814
- so do you have homework?
- No.

11:00.885 --> 11:04.787
No? Wow. Emilio,
you never have homework.

11:04.855 --> 11:06.618
- Lydia?
- ?Que?

11:14.365 --> 11:16.299
Oh shit.

11:16.367 --> 11:18.961
What are you looking at?

11:19.035 --> 11:21.435
What are you, a little pervert?
Don't you believe in knocking?

11:23.240 --> 11:24.764
stop it.

11:28.244 --> 11:30.178
There's no water.

11:30.246 --> 11:32.112
What do you mean,
there's no water?

11:35.852 --> 11:37.444
Well, I paid the bill. I sent it.

11:37.520 --> 11:40.182
It must have gotten lost.
I'll call tomorrow.

11:40.256 --> 11:41.848
Okay? ?Esta bien?

11:43.259 --> 11:44.555
What's wrong?

11:44.626 --> 11:47.595
Huh? ?Que paso--?

11:47.663 --> 11:49.095
shit!

11:49.163 --> 11:51.131
You been fighting again, Emilio?

11:52.835 --> 11:54.860
iCono! What have I told you
about that, huh?

11:54.937 --> 11:57.131
- Nothing.
- Nothing?! What happened?

11:57.205 --> 11:58.900
Nada. Nothing.

11:58.973 --> 12:01.772
I cannot afford another
emergency-room visit.

12:01.844 --> 12:03.572
- ?Me entiende?
- Oye, Lydia.

12:03.644 --> 12:06.306
Okay, stop babying
the boy, okay?

12:06.380 --> 12:08.143
What he needs is
a fucking ass-whipping.

12:08.216 --> 12:10.046
All right.

12:10.116 --> 12:11.550
- I'm not talking to you.
- Don't fucking yell at me.

12:21.762 --> 12:24.286
Go to the bathroom
and wash up, okay?

12:24.364 --> 12:26.389
Can I go to Grandma's?

12:26.466 --> 12:28.730
You can go to Daisy's
manana, okay?

12:28.802 --> 12:31.327
- Just stop it!
- Why do you call her Daisy and not Mom?

12:31.404 --> 12:34.601
Because she's a better grandmother
than she is a mom.

12:35.942 --> 12:38.001
Okay.
Well, good night...

12:38.078 --> 12:40.409
Lydia.

12:40.479 --> 12:42.505
Good night.

12:42.582 --> 12:44.641
- Lydia!
- ?Que?

12:44.718 --> 12:46.685
Get your ass in here!

13:00.064 --> 13:02.625
Boy.
There you are, T.

13:02.701 --> 13:05.295
Okay. No no, boy.
No, boy.

13:05.371 --> 13:06.633
It's in there, okay?

13:13.345 --> 13:14.777
Had enough, T?

13:24.155 --> 13:26.123
You've got doggie breath.

13:37.868 --> 13:40.565
Psst, T, wake up.

13:40.638 --> 13:43.333
shh shh shh.
Quiet down, quiet down.

13:49.780 --> 13:53.113
shh. stay here, boy.
I'll be right back.

13:53.183 --> 13:54.810
Okay?

14:06.162 --> 14:08.494
Ahh!

14:20.076 --> 14:21.304
Ah!

14:23.479 --> 14:25.743
Ah! Fuck you!

14:25.815 --> 14:28.544
Fuck you!
iHijo de puta!

14:28.617 --> 14:31.348
iHijo de puta!
Oh God.

14:35.190 --> 14:37.158
Get in the car.

14:42.797 --> 14:45.561
I'm sorry, baby.
I'm sorry.

14:45.634 --> 14:49.502
I love you, mi hijo,
and I'm sorry.

14:49.571 --> 14:52.062
- I'm sorry.
- Tell me what happened.

14:54.409 --> 14:58.208
Frank, they're not
taking my baby.

14:58.278 --> 15:00.804
Give me a minute, please.

15:03.484 --> 15:04.883
Emilio.

15:04.952 --> 15:06.681
Uncle Frank.

15:06.754 --> 15:07.914
Give me a hug.

15:12.760 --> 15:15.285
- I need you to do me a favor.
- Okay.

15:15.362 --> 15:17.727
- Can you go with this gentleman?
- Okay.

15:17.797 --> 15:19.857
- Frank, don't you dare.
- Lydia, Lydia, Lydia--

15:19.933 --> 15:21.764
- Frank! No! No!
- Lydia, Lydia.

15:21.835 --> 15:23.825
- Lydia--
- No, you fuckin' piece of shit.

15:23.903 --> 15:26.235
You're letting them
take my baby.

15:26.305 --> 15:27.670
- Lydia!
- You're not his father.

15:27.740 --> 15:29.709
You have no right!

15:29.777 --> 15:32.074
Lydia, Lydia!

15:32.145 --> 15:34.670
step away from the wall.

15:34.747 --> 15:37.079
No no!

16:01.473 --> 16:03.941
I'll never forget that night.

16:04.009 --> 16:06.239
I completely lost myself.

16:08.112 --> 16:10.604
I was just trying
to protect my mom.

16:12.317 --> 16:13.750
The judge didn't believe me

16:13.819 --> 16:15.683
and sentenced me
to seven months in jail.

16:19.191 --> 16:23.820
I was convicted with a second-degree
assault with a deadly weapon.

16:23.894 --> 16:25.828
Yep.

16:25.896 --> 16:28.228
My mom lost custody.

16:28.300 --> 16:30.631
That night changed my whole life.

16:42.379 --> 16:43.936
so how do you feel?

16:45.882 --> 16:48.113
I feel like I can't breathe.

16:48.185 --> 16:50.175
I feel like my heart
is going to explode.

16:50.253 --> 16:52.915
I feel like I'm going
to swallow my fuckin' tongue.

16:52.989 --> 16:55.321
I feel like thoughts are
going 1,000 miles an hour.

16:55.391 --> 16:56.983
How do I feel?
How do l--

16:57.060 --> 16:58.721
I don't know, man.

16:58.795 --> 17:00.820
Can you get
this thing off me, please?

17:00.897 --> 17:02.455
I can't.

17:02.532 --> 17:03.863
I'll get fired.

17:03.933 --> 17:07.527
But, uh, here you go.

17:12.608 --> 17:14.165
Oh.

17:14.242 --> 17:17.679
I knew your last name
sounded familiar.

17:17.747 --> 17:21.272
You're Frank Manrique's
nephew, right?

17:21.349 --> 17:22.749
Yeah.

17:24.419 --> 17:26.852
He wanted me
to give you this.

17:30.626 --> 17:32.753
so are you a boxer too?

17:53.481 --> 17:55.846
Hey, kid, what the hell
are you doing?

17:55.916 --> 17:58.283
You gotta be mopping.

17:58.352 --> 17:59.819
Come on.

18:12.232 --> 18:13.392
Again. You set?

18:16.802 --> 18:18.998
Okay, I want you to--

18:19.072 --> 18:21.597
Hey, Emilio,
back to work, buddy.

18:21.675 --> 18:23.643
Back to work.
Come on.

18:48.400 --> 18:49.867
Let's go, let's go,
let's go!

18:49.935 --> 18:51.493
- One more.
- Enough, come on.

18:51.570 --> 18:53.366
Come on, come on,
let me catch my breath.

18:53.438 --> 18:54.700
Let's go, let's go.

18:54.772 --> 18:57.606
It's the last round.
It's the last round, T.

18:57.676 --> 18:59.610
It's the last round.
What you got?

18:59.677 --> 19:01.304
Give me some more.

19:07.285 --> 19:09.515
Whoo! Emilio!

19:09.587 --> 19:11.555
Meet me at the ring, T.

19:13.625 --> 19:15.023
Emilio!

19:17.362 --> 19:18.829
What?

19:18.897 --> 19:20.831
You're gonna burn yourself out.
Come on.

19:20.899 --> 19:22.661
Mr. T's tired.
Let's go.

19:22.733 --> 19:25.065
Burn myself out? You been
telling me that since I was a little kid.

19:25.135 --> 19:27.104
True.

19:34.411 --> 19:36.345
I feel good.

19:36.413 --> 19:38.381
- I look good.
- All right.

19:38.448 --> 19:40.780
- All right, all right.
- I feel good.

19:42.952 --> 19:45.079
I don't know
what you been told

19:45.154 --> 19:47.282
- Uncle Frank...
- Nice and easy. Nice and easy.

19:47.357 --> 19:49.120
You got a fight tonight.
Nice and easy.

19:50.893 --> 19:52.884
Pace yourself.
That's right.

19:52.962 --> 19:54.156
That's right.

19:55.564 --> 19:57.828
What time did you get in
this morning?

19:57.900 --> 20:00.095
Around 5:00.

20:00.169 --> 20:02.194
Couldn't sleep again?

20:02.271 --> 20:05.068
Um, nah, man.
I just want to be ready.

20:05.140 --> 20:07.268
I got energy.
I want to be ready for tonight, baby.

20:07.343 --> 20:09.140
You'll never be ready, kid.

20:09.211 --> 20:10.735
Oh, Ben, what's up, man?

20:10.813 --> 20:12.905
When are you gonna
start promoting me?

20:12.981 --> 20:14.414
Hey.

20:14.482 --> 20:16.314
I cannot promote anybody
from jail.

20:16.385 --> 20:18.046
I don't even have that pull.

20:27.595 --> 20:29.358
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:29.431 --> 20:31.865
- I'm Emilio.
- I'm Kristina.

20:31.933 --> 20:33.763
- Kristina?
- Mm-hmm.

20:33.834 --> 20:36.360
Oh.

20:36.438 --> 20:38.702
I heard you're
sleeping here now.

20:38.773 --> 20:41.104
I'm saving money on gas.

20:41.175 --> 20:43.234
You need some money.

20:43.310 --> 20:45.438
No no no, I'm good.
I'm good.

20:46.748 --> 20:50.205
Okay, Frankie.
Talk to me. What's up?

20:50.284 --> 20:52.718
I need a favor.

20:52.786 --> 20:55.516
sure.
You're like my brother.

20:55.589 --> 20:58.114
- It's about Emilio.
- No.

20:58.192 --> 21:00.353
You just said that
I'm like your brother,

21:00.427 --> 21:02.121
that just ask,
that whatever I need--

21:02.195 --> 21:03.753
- No, I can't.
- Why not?

21:03.830 --> 21:05.058
Because of that.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.230
He just has a lot of energy.

21:11.304 --> 21:14.273
He's unfocused. He's all over the place.
He's like a wild horse.

21:14.340 --> 21:16.968
Is that why your fighters
are afraid of fighting him?

21:17.043 --> 21:19.068
I am not going
to promote Emilio.

21:19.145 --> 21:20.806
I'm not asking you
to promote him.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.745
Then what?

21:52.210 --> 21:53.767
You know what your problem is?

21:53.844 --> 21:55.437
What's my problem
this time, Talia?

21:55.514 --> 21:57.573
You need to stop copying
every boxer you know

21:57.649 --> 22:00.310
and start making
your own style.

22:00.384 --> 22:02.682
Look, if you're going
to do Ali's jab,

22:02.753 --> 22:04.745
at least do it right, okay?
He would twist his wrists

22:04.823 --> 22:06.154
as he would make contact.

22:06.224 --> 22:08.054
Also you need to stop
leading with your head, okay?

22:08.125 --> 22:12.459
You're not Arturo Gatti.
He had a jaw made of granite.

22:12.530 --> 22:15.055
And you have a pretty face,
so try and protect it.

22:18.936 --> 22:20.460
Anything else?

22:20.538 --> 22:23.370
Not at the moment,
but I see some improvement.

22:23.440 --> 22:24.840
Tell that to your pops.

22:24.909 --> 22:26.706
Yeah, he's focused on Teddy.

22:27.878 --> 22:30.607
Hey, Talia,
what are you doing here?

22:30.680 --> 22:32.739
- Dad, I'm working.
- Working?

22:32.816 --> 22:34.910
- Yeah.
- You need a ride home?

22:34.985 --> 22:36.713
- No.
- All right.

22:36.786 --> 22:38.378
Let's go shopping then, girl.

22:38.455 --> 22:41.083
- Okay, so you got that?
- Yeah. Yeah.

22:41.157 --> 22:43.852
so I was going to ask you,
what are you doing Friday night?

22:43.926 --> 22:47.260
'Cause l-- l, um--
I like your fa--

22:47.330 --> 22:49.730
your fashion now.
It changes--

22:49.799 --> 22:51.959
I knew it. Nope.
I didn't mean it.

22:54.037 --> 22:56.505
That was so dumb.

22:59.041 --> 23:01.407
What?
What are you looking at?

23:01.477 --> 23:05.243
Don't do all that.
Don't look at me all like that, okay?

23:05.314 --> 23:08.112
I got game.
You know how I get.

23:08.183 --> 23:09.480
Come-- come on, T.

23:11.520 --> 23:14.148
You mean the big black guy
with all the chains?

23:14.223 --> 23:16.589
No no no, Mr. T is my dog.

23:16.658 --> 23:18.125
He's a pit bull.

23:18.193 --> 23:20.956
I had him since I was a little kid.
He's like my best friend.

23:21.028 --> 23:22.996
Damn, Manny,
I trust him with my life.

23:23.064 --> 23:24.327
Why's that?

23:24.399 --> 23:26.127
Because I can relate to him.

23:26.200 --> 23:28.327
I hate how people
look down at pit bulls

23:28.402 --> 23:30.165
just 'cause of the way they look.

23:30.238 --> 23:33.400
You know what I mean?
I hate that shit.

23:33.473 --> 23:36.170
I want to start an organization
called Peace for Pit Bulls,

23:36.244 --> 23:38.235
Iike, whenever I start
getting money and shit.

23:38.312 --> 23:39.609
You know, helping out pits.

23:39.680 --> 23:43.012
And, uh, I just hate it

23:43.083 --> 23:45.518
that every time someone
looks at a pit bull, they judge them.

23:45.586 --> 23:46.848
You know what I mean?

23:46.921 --> 23:48.854
How do you think I feel?

23:48.922 --> 23:52.119
You should start an organization:
Peace for Manny.

23:53.260 --> 23:55.228
I try to keep a smile all day.

23:55.295 --> 23:58.856
And by the end of the day,
my face hurts.

23:58.932 --> 24:02.264
sometimes it's hard
to smile, huh, Manny?

24:05.138 --> 24:06.935
Oh, fuck.

24:07.007 --> 24:10.373
Hey, Manny, I'm not feeling
so good right now again.

24:10.442 --> 24:14.743
I'm feeling a little--
I'm feeling a little shaky.

24:14.814 --> 24:17.111
What can I do for you?

24:19.351 --> 24:21.444
Can we get a TV up in here
or something like that?

24:21.520 --> 24:24.250
Anything to just
take my mind off this.

24:24.323 --> 24:26.757
I can make that happen.

24:33.632 --> 24:34.826
It's not that easy.

24:34.900 --> 24:37.198
You could just walk up
to any bitch and hump her.

24:37.269 --> 24:39.964
It's not like that in real life--
you gotta wine and dine 'em.

24:40.038 --> 24:42.199
And then when you go up
to a girl, what do you say?

24:42.273 --> 24:44.538
You know, and then you
have to have pick-up lines.

24:44.610 --> 24:46.167
T, are you listening?

24:46.244 --> 24:48.940
This is human world.
Do you know what I mean?

24:49.013 --> 24:52.813
You just don't walk up
to girls and pick--

25:02.392 --> 25:03.826
Hey.

25:03.895 --> 25:05.123
Hi.

25:07.264 --> 25:09.755
You come here often?

25:09.833 --> 25:11.198
It's the bus stop.

25:11.268 --> 25:12.861
Oh, yeah.

25:16.707 --> 25:19.039
- Cute dog.
- Oh, yeah.

25:19.109 --> 25:20.167
What's his name?

25:20.244 --> 25:22.177
Mr. T.
He's my little brother.

25:22.245 --> 25:24.373
Yeah, he's-- I'm-- I'm--

25:24.448 --> 25:28.248
I'm the fighter.
He's actually the lover.

25:28.318 --> 25:29.978
He's cute.

25:30.052 --> 25:32.283
- I'm cute? Oh, he's cute!
- He's cute.

25:32.356 --> 25:33.414
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

25:33.490 --> 25:36.617
Born and raised in Dade County.

25:40.763 --> 25:45.063
You know the difference
between a dog and a wife?

25:46.435 --> 25:49.563
If-- if you lock up, um, your dog

25:49.639 --> 25:51.333
and your wife in a trunk

25:51.406 --> 25:53.307
and you let 'em out
an hour later,

25:53.376 --> 25:54.968
guess who's happy
to see you?

25:55.044 --> 25:57.204
- Is that the bus?
- Yeah.

26:10.859 --> 26:12.724
Hey, there she is,

26:12.794 --> 26:15.763
all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed,
ready to take on the world.

26:15.830 --> 26:16.854
Morning, Dad.

26:16.931 --> 26:19.228
Can I talk to you for a minute?

26:19.300 --> 26:22.270
You've been like a busy bee lately.
What are you up to?

26:22.337 --> 26:24.828
I-- I've had a couple
of meetings lately.

26:24.906 --> 26:26.896
You know, if I'm going
to be a female boxing promoter,

26:26.974 --> 26:28.271
I've got to work twice as hard.

26:28.342 --> 26:31.744
Benjamin, you said you were
taking me shopping today.

26:31.813 --> 26:33.803
Okay, honey, go get ready.

26:33.881 --> 26:36.247
I'd like to buy that dress
I've been telling you about.

26:36.317 --> 26:37.875
It's awesome.

26:37.951 --> 26:39.919
Can l, like, talk to my dad
for, like, one second?

26:39.987 --> 26:42.751
Maybe, like someday?
I don't know.

26:42.823 --> 26:44.415
Okay.

26:44.491 --> 26:47.755
Dad, when are you going
to get rid of her?

26:47.827 --> 26:49.692
I don't know.

26:49.762 --> 26:51.458
I like her.

26:52.633 --> 26:54.032
What about you?

26:54.101 --> 26:56.034
When are you going
to get rid of him?

26:56.102 --> 26:57.592
Who?

26:57.670 --> 26:59.194
Emilio.

26:59.272 --> 27:01.400
- What?
- Are you banging him?

27:01.475 --> 27:04.238
- Dad!
- Eh, it's all good.

27:04.310 --> 27:05.572
He's a good-looking kid.

27:05.645 --> 27:07.306
You know I don't
give you too much shit

27:07.380 --> 27:08.847
about the guys you go out with.

27:08.915 --> 27:11.076
Just don't keep him around
too long, that's all.

27:11.150 --> 27:13.015
Have your fun and then move on.

27:13.086 --> 27:14.849
I'm not interested
in him like that.

27:14.921 --> 27:16.615
Then what?

27:16.688 --> 27:18.383
That's what I want
to talk to you about.

27:20.125 --> 27:22.060
I'm not going to promote him.

27:22.128 --> 27:23.254
I know that.

27:25.397 --> 27:27.524
so you had a meeting
with Frank.

27:27.599 --> 27:29.032
Yes, I did.

27:29.101 --> 27:31.262
Great.
What did he say?

27:31.336 --> 27:33.099
He said you were going
to help him,

27:33.171 --> 27:34.798
try to get Emilio
into Golden Gloves.

27:34.873 --> 27:36.704
- Yeah.
- so what happened?

27:36.775 --> 27:40.871
The boxing commissioner
wants nothing to do with him.

27:40.946 --> 27:42.880
They say maybe next year.

27:42.948 --> 27:44.973
so you're telling me
one of the most well-connected

27:45.050 --> 27:47.210
boxing promoters in south Florida
couldn't get him in?

27:47.284 --> 27:49.343
- sweetie, stop stop stop.
- Come on.

27:49.420 --> 27:52.287
Emilio is not my priority.

27:52.356 --> 27:54.881
- I tried.
- Did you? Did you really?

27:54.959 --> 27:57.826
Because, I don't know,
I feel like maybe you're scared

27:57.895 --> 27:59.759
that if Emilio qualifies,

27:59.829 --> 28:01.957
he's going to take
the spotlight away from Teddy.

28:02.032 --> 28:04.159
Are you comparing Teddy
now with Emilio?

28:04.235 --> 28:07.601
I don't feel safe having that kid
in the same ring with Teddy.

28:07.670 --> 28:08.830
He will kill him.

28:08.905 --> 28:11.136
I guess we're just going
to have to find out.

28:11.208 --> 28:14.506
Because I'm promoting Emilio
and I'm getting him into Golden Gloves.

28:14.577 --> 28:16.204
Love you.

28:27.257 --> 28:29.622
Can I ask you something,
Grandma?

28:29.691 --> 28:30.954
Of course.

28:34.531 --> 28:37.124
Do you think God exists?

28:37.199 --> 28:39.667
Of course I do.

28:40.837 --> 28:42.861
How do you know?

28:44.440 --> 28:46.965
He gave me you.

28:47.042 --> 28:49.306
God gave me you.

28:49.378 --> 28:50.572
Huh?

28:59.587 --> 29:00.987
What?

29:02.691 --> 29:05.625
Oh my God, you sound
like such a grown man.

29:05.693 --> 29:07.320
Finally!

29:08.696 --> 29:10.494
You haven't called.

29:10.566 --> 29:12.055
I've been busy.
I gotta go.

29:12.133 --> 29:13.794
Call me later
or something, okay?

29:13.868 --> 29:15.893
Oh, okay.
I miss you, mi amor.

29:15.970 --> 29:17.767
That's all.
I just want to see you.

29:17.839 --> 29:19.932
I got a fight tonight, Mom.
I don't want to--

29:20.007 --> 29:21.975
You have a fight?
Can I come see you?

29:22.043 --> 29:23.340
You want to come
to my fight?

29:23.411 --> 29:25.538
Yeah!
I want to come see you.

29:27.848 --> 29:29.440
Okay. All right.

29:29.517 --> 29:31.508
You can come at 7:30.
You gotta be there early though.

29:31.586 --> 29:34.110
I can-- I can get you
a good seat if you come.

29:34.187 --> 29:36.314
Okay.
Okay okay, perfect.

29:38.625 --> 29:40.820
All right, so I'll see you
tonight at 7:30.

29:40.894 --> 29:42.452
Okay, 7:30. I'll be there.

29:42.529 --> 29:44.759
I promise I'll be there.
I'll be the first one there.

29:44.831 --> 29:46.594
- Okay.
- I love you.

29:50.504 --> 29:52.438
Be nice to your mom.

29:52.506 --> 29:55.804
Okay? she's trying.

29:55.875 --> 29:58.036
And nobody's perfect.

30:00.447 --> 30:02.277
Mr. T is.

30:03.949 --> 30:06.713
she says she's going
to come to my fight.

30:06.785 --> 30:08.377
Good.

30:08.454 --> 30:10.422
Muy bien.
so what do you want to eat?

30:10.489 --> 30:14.789
Huh? I have congri,
tasajo, ropa vieja--

30:14.860 --> 30:16.759
Grandma, I have a fight tonight.
I can't eat.

30:16.828 --> 30:18.557
- We go over this every time.
- You're too skinny.

30:18.630 --> 30:20.223
- I can't eat.
- You're too skinny.

30:20.299 --> 30:21.789
You have to eat
before the fight.

30:21.867 --> 30:23.595
All right, you just got
to come to my fight

30:23.668 --> 30:25.396
then I'll eat
whatever you want.

30:25.469 --> 30:26.959
Okay.

30:28.505 --> 30:29.905
You got it.

30:40.050 --> 30:42.041
Come on, Jimmy!
Kick his ass!

30:42.119 --> 30:44.212
What the hell is wrong
with your brother?

30:44.288 --> 30:46.050
The Spanish kid is pretty fast.

30:46.122 --> 30:48.420
Fuck him. Come on, Jimmy.
Beat his ass.

30:48.491 --> 30:51.256
Will you please
be quiet already?

30:51.328 --> 30:54.296
shut up before that old lady
gets her cane and beats your ass.

30:54.363 --> 30:56.058
Come on, Jimmy!

31:16.918 --> 31:18.716
Cocky little fucker, isn't he?

31:18.788 --> 31:21.085
Damn, dude, your brother sucks.

31:21.156 --> 31:23.317
He's getting his ass beat.

31:23.391 --> 31:25.325
Thank you.

31:25.393 --> 31:27.293
shut up, lady.

31:27.362 --> 31:31.025
Come on, Jimmy!
Cut him off like we talked about!

31:42.410 --> 31:43.842
Come on, Jimmy!

31:43.911 --> 31:45.970
stay on him, stay on him,
stay on him!

31:46.046 --> 31:48.572
That's it, that's it, that's it.

31:48.650 --> 31:51.482
stay on him!
Get back on him!

32:07.400 --> 32:09.699
All right, you made your point.

32:09.770 --> 32:11.430
This is the guy Benjamin said

32:11.504 --> 32:13.597
was supposed to knock me out
in the first round?

32:13.673 --> 32:15.265
- Fight's not over.
- I know, I know.

32:15.341 --> 32:17.104
Just trying to put on
a good show, you know?

32:17.176 --> 32:19.110
- All right, Emilio?
- Yeah.

32:19.178 --> 32:21.169
- You need to pay attention.
- I got you.

32:21.247 --> 32:23.613
Listen-- Emilio?

32:23.683 --> 32:25.674
- Emilio? Emilio?
- Yeah?

32:25.752 --> 32:27.412
The fight's not out there.
It's in here.

32:27.486 --> 32:28.681
- All right.
- You need to focus.

32:28.755 --> 32:30.086
This guy's gonna be
looking for a knockout.

32:30.156 --> 32:32.021
I need you to keep
your hands up, all right?

32:32.091 --> 32:33.352
- Yeah. You got it.
- Keep your hands up.

32:33.425 --> 32:34.949
- What did I just say?
- You said win the fight!

32:35.027 --> 32:36.892
- Win the fight, win the fight.
- I said keep--

32:36.962 --> 32:38.225
Let's go! You got it.

32:48.674 --> 32:51.336
That's it, that's it, that's it.

32:51.410 --> 32:53.571
Yeah.

32:57.114 --> 32:59.174
Come on, Jimmy!

33:07.459 --> 33:09.790
Come on, Jimmy!

33:20.538 --> 33:22.096
That was a good fight, man.

33:22.173 --> 33:23.833
Not really, dude.

33:26.509 --> 33:29.001
Whatever.
I really don't care.

33:32.282 --> 33:34.079
All good.

33:36.119 --> 33:37.382
Damn.

33:37.455 --> 33:39.649
Those are some
nice shoes, man.

33:39.723 --> 33:41.088
How much you pay for those?

33:41.157 --> 33:42.988
I don't know, dude.

33:43.059 --> 33:45.458
My sponsors pay for everything
for me and my brother.

33:45.527 --> 33:47.155
sponsors?

33:51.101 --> 33:53.261
Well, I'll catch you later.

33:53.335 --> 33:54.666
All right.

34:05.280 --> 34:07.305
Hey, what happened?

34:07.382 --> 34:09.815
I don't know. I'm sorry.

34:09.885 --> 34:12.080
Why didn't you stick to the game plan
we talked about?

34:12.154 --> 34:14.178
- Dude, I tried.
- Don't call me dude.

34:14.255 --> 34:17.315
Hey, good fight.

34:17.391 --> 34:18.449
Thank you.

34:18.527 --> 34:20.085
Yeah.

34:20.161 --> 34:21.753
I'm Teddy.

34:21.829 --> 34:24.353
I'm Jimmy's bigger,
faster, stronger brother.

34:27.668 --> 34:29.135
Okay.
I'm-- I'm Emilio.

34:29.203 --> 34:30.362
Yeah.

34:30.438 --> 34:32.906
It was a good fight.

34:32.974 --> 34:34.565
No.

34:34.641 --> 34:36.507
No, it wasn't.

34:36.577 --> 34:38.340
Yo, back up, man.

34:38.411 --> 34:40.777
- Hey!
- Bro, bro, come on.

34:40.848 --> 34:42.871
Let's get out of here.
Let's go home. Come on.

34:42.949 --> 34:44.541
Grandma, we're playing around.

34:44.618 --> 34:46.143
Come on.

34:46.219 --> 34:48.449
sinverguenza.

35:10.977 --> 35:12.341
What?

35:12.411 --> 35:15.643
I brought you these.

35:15.715 --> 35:18.343
I'm allergic
to flowers, remember?

35:18.418 --> 35:20.442
Oh yeah, that's right.

35:22.655 --> 35:24.486
I'm sorry.

35:24.557 --> 35:26.855
I'm sorry I didn't make it
to your fight last night.

35:26.926 --> 35:28.587
I really tried.

35:28.661 --> 35:30.925
I'm sure you did.
I'm sure you did.

35:30.996 --> 35:32.963
I did, papito. I tried.

35:35.233 --> 35:36.929
Can I come in?

35:46.846 --> 35:49.006
You can you give these
to your grandma.

35:49.080 --> 35:50.775
Where is she?

35:52.050 --> 35:53.745
Where do you think she's at?

35:53.818 --> 35:55.285
Working.

35:55.353 --> 35:57.617
Yeah, working. she got two jobs.

35:57.689 --> 36:00.157
Doctor says she can't do it,
but you know how she is--

36:00.225 --> 36:02.317
- hard-headed.
- Mmm.

36:02.392 --> 36:04.155
Runs in the family.

36:04.228 --> 36:07.323
Yeah.

36:08.666 --> 36:10.496
I've been doing really good.

36:10.567 --> 36:12.194
I'm not drinking...

36:12.269 --> 36:13.702
that much.

36:13.770 --> 36:16.204
You know, when I get nervous,
I have a beer.

36:17.608 --> 36:20.577
But-- oh yeah,
l-- I got a job.

36:20.644 --> 36:22.271
- You got a job?
- Yeah.

36:22.346 --> 36:24.210
I had one.

36:24.280 --> 36:26.249
I got fired
for being late 30 minutes.

36:26.316 --> 36:28.546
The guy was really stupid.
It wasn't even my fault.

36:31.988 --> 36:33.615
Wow.

36:34.892 --> 36:37.326
It's never your fault.
How is it ever your fault?

36:37.394 --> 36:39.020
It's always somebody else.
You know that?

36:39.095 --> 36:41.063
You know you can't hold a job
for more than two months.

36:41.130 --> 36:42.654
You're 40 years old.
What do you want from me?

36:42.732 --> 36:44.792
Great to see you too.

36:44.868 --> 36:47.301
- Don't do all that.
- No no no no! It's fine.

36:47.370 --> 36:49.895
It's fine. Look, I'm sorry.

36:49.972 --> 36:52.496
I'm so sorry that I am not perfect
like your grandmother.

36:52.574 --> 36:54.098
There we go.
You're gonna start that?

36:54.175 --> 36:57.270
Like your Tito--
like your perfect uncle.

36:57.346 --> 36:59.973
I'm not going
to bother you anymore, okay?

37:00.048 --> 37:01.447
- Good.
- No no, I'm not.

37:01.516 --> 37:03.609
I'm not going
to bother you anymore.

37:03.685 --> 37:05.085
But you know what?

37:05.154 --> 37:07.246
No matter how much
you hate me,

37:07.322 --> 37:09.790
I am still your mother.

37:44.558 --> 37:46.082
- What?!
- Oh!

37:47.394 --> 37:48.952
Wo-- wow.

37:49.029 --> 37:51.155
Is that the way everybody answers
their door in your neighborhood?

37:51.230 --> 37:52.595
No, I thought
you were someone--

37:52.665 --> 37:54.156
I thought you were
somebody else.

37:54.234 --> 37:56.429
Yeah. Who was that woman
that just came out of here?

37:56.503 --> 37:58.732
Uh, it was a Jehovah Witness.

37:59.772 --> 38:00.966
Oh.

38:02.141 --> 38:04.076
- so you--
- I wanted to--

38:04.143 --> 38:06.839
- sorry, you go first.
- Um... okay, I just--

38:06.913 --> 38:09.473
I wanted to know if you wanted
to hang out or something.

38:09.549 --> 38:10.846
Okay.

38:10.917 --> 38:12.713
I mean, 'cause I was bored
and I thought--

38:12.784 --> 38:16.016
Oh no, I'm-- I'm always bored.
You know.

38:16.089 --> 38:18.114
My uncle said that
I can't go to the boxing gym,

38:18.191 --> 38:20.249
'cause he's going to beat me
with a broomstick.

38:20.325 --> 38:22.156
You know, I'm down to do
whatever you want to do.

38:22.227 --> 38:23.661
Whatever I want to do?

38:25.565 --> 38:27.088
Okay, go get ready.

38:27.165 --> 38:29.565
All right. I'm gonna go put on
a condom real quick--

38:29.634 --> 38:31.329
I'm-- I'm gonna go
put on a shirt real quick.

38:31.403 --> 38:33.097
I meant-- I meant
to say shirt.

38:34.373 --> 38:36.841
- You're crazy. You know that?
- Yeah.

38:36.908 --> 38:39.433
Um, I'll meet you in the car.
I'll see you there.

38:39.511 --> 38:40.841
Um, okay.

38:43.382 --> 38:45.907
God. God.

38:45.984 --> 38:47.450
What does this do?

38:47.518 --> 38:50.316
Oh, that one just turns--
oh no, turn it off.

38:50.388 --> 38:52.754
Okay, close that.

38:52.823 --> 38:55.792
Why do you always carry
a backpack around?

38:55.860 --> 38:57.521
stop.

38:58.763 --> 39:00.230
What about this one?

39:00.297 --> 39:01.854
That one actually
warms your butt.

39:01.931 --> 39:04.196
Yeah right.
Can you imagine if

39:04.268 --> 39:06.600
they made a car that
could warm up your butt?

39:07.805 --> 39:09.533
Oh my God, you're not kidding.

39:09.606 --> 39:11.403
I know.

39:11.474 --> 39:14.774
- I feel kind of violated.
- You should.

39:15.913 --> 39:17.379
It's like a spaceship in here.

39:17.447 --> 39:20.610
We should go to the moon.

39:20.683 --> 39:23.481
You know, I was thinking
something a little bit more challenging.

39:25.422 --> 39:27.049
This feels kind of weird.

39:27.123 --> 39:28.181
What does?

39:28.258 --> 39:31.818
Um, the whole heated car seat.

39:31.894 --> 39:33.624
Oh, hold on-- okay here.

39:33.696 --> 39:36.324
It actually cools
the whole seat down.

39:36.399 --> 39:38.662
Feels good?

39:38.734 --> 39:40.065
Yeah.

39:50.446 --> 39:52.573
Okay okay, I hear you.

39:52.648 --> 39:54.616
I hear you.

39:56.318 --> 39:59.878
Uh, hello?

39:59.954 --> 40:01.717
- Hello?
- Mami, mami, oye,

40:01.789 --> 40:03.519
how many times
you gonna say hello?

40:03.592 --> 40:05.492
M'ijo, how are you?

40:05.561 --> 40:07.824
Good good. Oye, I'm calling you
'cause Emilio and l

40:07.895 --> 40:09.795
are gonna go have dinner
to celebrate his win

40:09.864 --> 40:11.525
and I want to know
if you want to come with us.

40:11.599 --> 40:14.363
Uh, I would love to,
but I have to work

40:14.435 --> 40:15.959
until late tonight.

40:16.037 --> 40:17.834
Maybe next week
we can all go, eh?

40:17.905 --> 40:19.566
I thought today
was your day off?

40:19.640 --> 40:22.234
It is, at my other job.

40:22.310 --> 40:23.868
What?
You got two jobs, mami?

40:23.945 --> 40:25.810
Frankie, you know,

40:25.880 --> 40:27.745
I don't want to talk
about this right now.

40:27.815 --> 40:30.647
I don't have the time
to have an argument--

40:30.717 --> 40:32.777
Vieja, remember, the doctor
said that you shouldn't--

40:32.854 --> 40:34.719
Frankie, I gotta go, okay?

40:34.789 --> 40:36.312
Bye bye, I love you.

40:38.191 --> 40:40.216
I love you too.

40:49.069 --> 40:50.592
so where are we going?

40:50.669 --> 40:52.535
We are actually going shopping.

40:52.606 --> 40:54.005
- shopping?
- Yeah.

40:54.074 --> 40:55.905
I want to get you
an outfit for tonight.

40:55.976 --> 40:57.567
- Tonight?
- It's nothing.

40:57.643 --> 40:59.634
It's just a small party
I put together.

40:59.712 --> 41:01.145
Okay.

41:01.213 --> 41:03.648
Trust me. You're going
to have fun, Emilio.

41:03.717 --> 41:05.377
I'm having fun.

41:05.451 --> 41:07.180
Okay.

42:56.024 --> 42:58.219
Excellent, yes.
I'm DJ scottie C

42:58.293 --> 43:00.693
with Dream Team Entertainment.
And I've just been informed

43:00.762 --> 43:03.253
that our queen of the evening
has arrived.

43:03.331 --> 43:05.026
so please put your hands together

43:05.100 --> 43:06.623
as she makes her way
on up to the stage--

43:06.700 --> 43:09.362
the beautiful, the talented,
the absolutely lovely

43:09.436 --> 43:12.099
and always timely
Miss Talia Portillo.

43:17.077 --> 43:20.103
Hi, everybody. Thank you so much
for coming out here.

43:20.180 --> 43:22.671
Most of you know me as
Benjamin Portillo's daughter,

43:22.750 --> 43:25.048
the head of Portillo Promotions.

43:25.119 --> 43:27.417
But tonight I'm happy
to announce the formation

43:27.488 --> 43:29.352
of a new promotional boxing company

43:29.422 --> 43:32.790
headed by its first
female boxing promoter.

43:34.395 --> 43:35.952
Whoo!

43:38.865 --> 43:39.923
Thank you.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.264
Um, T Promotions
is happy to announce

43:42.336 --> 43:45.361
its first fighter-- Emilio Manrique.

43:45.438 --> 43:48.305
Come on up here.
Everybody give him a round of applause.

43:48.374 --> 43:50.069
Come on, everybody.

43:50.143 --> 43:51.542
- Come on!
- Emilio!

44:03.256 --> 44:05.086
- Yeah!
- speech!

44:05.157 --> 44:08.320
- Yeah!
- Come on, Emilio.

44:08.393 --> 44:10.828
What are we doing?

44:10.897 --> 44:12.864
You needed a boxing promoter,
so I got you one.

44:12.931 --> 44:14.262
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna promote you.

44:14.333 --> 44:17.325
Yeah, I thought
that we were on a--

44:17.402 --> 44:18.629
- What's--
- I have to go.

44:18.703 --> 44:20.228
Wait, Emilio--

44:20.305 --> 44:22.102
Where are you going?

44:22.174 --> 44:25.337
I'm sorry, everybody.
Emilio is a little bit shy.

44:25.410 --> 44:28.276
Have fun. Enjoy. Thank you
so much for coming out here.

44:28.346 --> 44:30.679
scottie, keep it going. Have fun!

44:30.749 --> 44:34.047
No more of that awkward moment.
Let's dance, everybody.

44:40.191 --> 44:42.125
Emilio, what's wrong?

44:42.193 --> 44:45.060
You told me this was a small party.

44:45.129 --> 44:47.596
This is insane, okay?
What's going on?

44:47.664 --> 44:49.188
It was supposed to be
a surprise, okay?

44:49.266 --> 44:51.063
- I'm putting all my money on you.
- Oh, money!

44:51.135 --> 44:52.102
Money-- there it is.

44:52.169 --> 44:53.796
Money?
This was about money?

44:53.871 --> 44:55.394
'Cause I don't have any
and I can't pay you back.

44:55.472 --> 44:57.201
stop. I don't want you
to pay me back, okay?

44:57.273 --> 44:59.208
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm not your dancing little monkey.

44:59.276 --> 45:00.800
Okay? I'm not.

45:00.878 --> 45:02.276
Go ahead, be straight up.
What do you want from me?

45:02.345 --> 45:04.108
Nothing.

45:04.180 --> 45:07.081
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
before about the party.

45:07.150 --> 45:09.209
I thought you would be excited.

45:09.285 --> 45:11.776
I don't feel good

45:11.855 --> 45:15.484
in these kind of places
with these kind of people.

45:20.497 --> 45:21.794
I'm sorry.

45:24.199 --> 45:27.032
I guess I'm just not used to it.
That's it.

45:30.439 --> 45:35.069
Well, you're just going to have
to start getting used to it.

45:35.144 --> 45:37.374
'Cause you're with
T Promotions now.

45:50.259 --> 45:51.920
- Ready to dance?
- Mm-hmm.

45:51.993 --> 45:53.688
You sure?
You been training?

45:53.761 --> 45:54.921
Have I been training?

45:54.996 --> 45:57.396
Are you sure about that?
Are you gonna be ready?

46:07.741 --> 46:09.334
so who's your inspiration?

46:09.410 --> 46:10.843
Do you fight for the Golden Gloves?

46:10.912 --> 46:13.176
I want to, yeah.
I want to fight for the Golden Gloves.

46:13.247 --> 46:15.714
- How many days a week do you train?
- Where are you training?

46:15.782 --> 46:18.308
Um, I train at Frank's Boxing Gym.
That's my uncle.

46:18.386 --> 46:19.819
Oh, Frank's! Yeah.

46:19.887 --> 46:21.547
We're trying to get him
into Golden Gloves.

46:21.621 --> 46:23.248
But you know what?
Let's not talk about business.

46:23.323 --> 46:24.415
- Let's have fun.
- Okay.

46:24.491 --> 46:25.981
- We'll go back you up.
- Oh, thank you.

46:26.059 --> 46:28.857
Hey, looking good,
you two.

46:28.929 --> 46:31.261
Purple and purple
like a couple of bruises.

46:31.331 --> 46:32.764
- How you doin'?
- Teddy.

46:32.833 --> 46:34.266
Great to finally
get to meet you.

46:34.334 --> 46:36.028
I saw you fight last year
at Golden Glove.

46:36.101 --> 46:38.593
Thank you very much.
How you doin'?

46:38.672 --> 46:40.606
You gonna take it again
this year or what?

46:40.674 --> 46:42.868
Oh, definitely.
There's no competition.

46:42.942 --> 46:45.001
- Cheers, guys.
- Good luck.

46:45.077 --> 46:48.013
so, Talia,

46:48.081 --> 46:50.810
you want to jump head first
into the boxing world

46:50.883 --> 46:53.579
and this is who you're banking
your future on?

46:53.652 --> 46:56.052
Teddy, what is your problem?

46:56.121 --> 46:57.712
I don't like him
hanging around you

46:57.790 --> 46:59.655
'cause I don't trust
the piece of shit, okay?

46:59.725 --> 47:00.817
- Damn it--
- Hey hey hey!

47:00.893 --> 47:02.451
- stop! Emilio, stop.
- sorry, Teddy.

47:02.528 --> 47:04.188
Bobby, he didn't do anything.
No, stop.

47:04.262 --> 47:06.059
Emilio, just wait for me
outside, please.

47:06.130 --> 47:07.962
You're such an asshole!

47:09.001 --> 47:10.730
And what are you doing here?
Where's my dad?

47:10.803 --> 47:13.168
He went out of town
for a meeting.

47:13.238 --> 47:16.867
I'm chaperone, making sure Teddy
stays out of trouble.

47:16.941 --> 47:19.409
Who's going to make sure
he stays out of you?

47:19.477 --> 47:21.069
Huh?

47:22.580 --> 47:24.548
I don't get you, Talia.

47:24.616 --> 47:26.378
You didn't have to go
through all this trouble

47:26.450 --> 47:29.113
if all you want to do if fuck
a piece of Miami street trash.

47:31.422 --> 47:34.117
shh shh shh.

47:34.191 --> 47:37.183
Calm down. shh.
I'd be careful if I were you.

47:37.261 --> 47:40.321
I don't want to have to tell
my promoter that his daughter

47:40.397 --> 47:43.298
just gave his future
meal ticket a fat lip.

47:43.367 --> 47:44.664
Off you go.

47:47.538 --> 47:49.335
- You okay?
- Yeah.

47:58.181 --> 47:59.614
Oh, man.

47:59.683 --> 48:01.582
I-- I watch a lot of this
with my grandma.

48:01.651 --> 48:03.846
It's kind of awkward
when the girls get naked.

48:03.920 --> 48:05.547
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

48:05.621 --> 48:07.249
Yeah.

48:07.324 --> 48:10.349
Your grandma sounds cool.

48:10.426 --> 48:12.451
My mom used
to love these, man.

48:12.528 --> 48:14.689
she'd watch them all the time.

48:18.734 --> 48:21.567
My mom is kind of the opposite.

48:21.637 --> 48:25.800
she's-- she's the one
that should be up in here.

48:25.874 --> 48:28.435
I think the reason
why I'm in here is 'cause of her.

48:28.511 --> 48:30.535
You know, she-- she has
these mood swings

48:30.612 --> 48:33.172
and she can go from zero to 100.
You know what I mean?

48:33.248 --> 48:37.582
Yeah. Well, you know, that's most
of the female population.

48:37.652 --> 48:39.586
You know what I mean?

48:39.654 --> 48:42.418
she's still-- that's the one
that gave you life, man.

48:42.490 --> 48:45.014
That's Mom.

48:45.092 --> 48:46.958
You know,
when we hold on to stuff

48:47.028 --> 48:48.791
that we have nothing
to do with--

48:48.863 --> 48:52.161
you know, it's like
you can't choose your parents.

48:52.232 --> 48:56.032
You hold on to stuff,
it doesn't hurt anybody but you.

48:56.103 --> 48:57.867
- It doesn't work.
- But, Manny,

48:57.939 --> 49:00.202
it's still affecting me right now.
That's the issue.

49:00.274 --> 49:02.367
- Oh yeah, no no, I understand.
- You know what I mean?

49:02.443 --> 49:04.604
Yeah, I understand.
But it's kind of like,

49:04.678 --> 49:06.702
"What can I do about it
right now?"

49:06.779 --> 49:08.371
You know, hey, so you--

49:08.448 --> 49:11.110
you just gotta, like,
take it with a grain of salt.

49:11.184 --> 49:12.708
Move on.

49:27.100 --> 49:29.192
Where were you last night?
You left me hanging.

49:29.267 --> 49:30.734
- Last night?
- Yeah.

49:30.802 --> 49:33.464
What happened last night?

49:33.538 --> 49:35.471
shit.

49:35.539 --> 49:37.337
I forgot. I'm sorry.

49:37.409 --> 49:39.468
Yeah.
This is for you.

49:39.544 --> 49:42.979
What you got over here, man?
What you got? Ooh!

49:43.047 --> 49:44.514
- Thank you.
- No no no.

49:44.582 --> 49:46.380
Don't thank me.
I didn't get you that shit.

49:46.451 --> 49:47.543
- Grandma?
- No.

49:49.021 --> 49:51.648
- My mom?
- Don't make a big deal about it.

49:51.722 --> 49:53.849
Just say thank you
when you see her.

49:57.662 --> 49:59.220
You see, moments like this

49:59.296 --> 50:01.821
makes me feel that I can
accomplish anything.

50:01.899 --> 50:05.699
My dream has been to move
to California just like my uncle did,

50:05.770 --> 50:08.432
fight the best fighters
from all over the world.

50:11.207 --> 50:14.506
These shoes make me feel
like I'm floating on the air.

50:14.577 --> 50:17.775
They make me feel
stronger, faster.

50:19.282 --> 50:21.477
I love my mom.

50:21.551 --> 50:24.247
Or at least I try to.

50:24.320 --> 50:26.914
I try to enjoy these times.

50:26.990 --> 50:29.220
Is that you?

50:29.292 --> 50:30.520
Hey! Aah!

50:32.228 --> 50:34.195
Ahhh!

50:35.432 --> 50:37.900
Mi amor, I missed you so much.

50:40.035 --> 50:41.400
Look at you.

50:41.470 --> 50:43.836
Wow. Wow, let me see.
Let me see.

50:47.010 --> 50:49.477
My God.

50:49.545 --> 50:52.878
Wow, baby, you're not
a baby anymore.

50:57.252 --> 50:59.652
Uh, yeah, is everything okay?

50:59.722 --> 51:01.655
si, mira, everything's good.

51:01.723 --> 51:03.884
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Do I look good?

51:03.958 --> 51:06.120
Okay, I'm gonna serve you.

51:09.030 --> 51:12.397
Ahem. Ahem.

51:20.775 --> 51:22.743
Your favorite.

51:29.484 --> 51:31.542
I like the shoes you got me.
They look really good.

51:31.618 --> 51:33.245
- Yeah?
- showing them off to everyone.

51:33.320 --> 51:35.653
That's awesome!
Que bueno.

51:35.723 --> 51:37.247
I saved up for them.

51:37.325 --> 51:40.225
I saw them, I'm like,
"Those are for my baby."

51:40.293 --> 51:42.420
I knew you were
going to love them.

52:01.914 --> 52:04.007
Hello?

52:04.083 --> 52:05.381
Yes.

52:07.887 --> 52:09.286
What?

52:10.356 --> 52:12.415
Yes, that's-- that's me.

52:13.725 --> 52:17.218
What-- okay.

52:17.296 --> 52:20.424
Okay, what--
what room is she in?

52:20.499 --> 52:22.796
What-- what room?

52:22.867 --> 52:24.836
471 2. 47--

52:24.904 --> 52:27.202
Okay.
Okay, thank you.

52:47.826 --> 52:49.588
Excuse me, 471 2?

52:49.660 --> 52:51.628
Down the hall, on the left.

53:01.071 --> 53:02.402
He said "left," right?

53:02.472 --> 53:03.667
Yeah, I think so.

53:05.008 --> 53:07.169
Let's go, guys.
We gotta go.

53:07.244 --> 53:08.370
Yeah, definitely.

53:08.445 --> 53:10.970
Yeah, I just had
a minor setback, so...

53:11.047 --> 53:13.710
sure. You know what?
Let me call you back.

53:13.784 --> 53:16.116
Hi, I'm Angela.
I don't believe we've met.

53:16.186 --> 53:17.983
- Frank.
- Nice to meet you, Frank.

53:18.055 --> 53:22.081
You must be Emilio. Your grandmother
has told me an awful lot about you.

53:22.158 --> 53:24.525
- You're the baseball player.
- Mom, who are these people?

53:24.595 --> 53:26.892
You know what, guys? Go grab
some candy over there, would you?

53:26.963 --> 53:29.523
I'll be right back.
I'm sorry we had to meet like this,

53:29.599 --> 53:30.998
but she's going to be just fine.

53:31.067 --> 53:32.398
What happened to her?

53:32.468 --> 53:34.561
she fainted when she was
playing with the kids.

53:34.637 --> 53:36.605
The doctor said she had
a slight heart attack.

53:36.672 --> 53:38.537
- A what?
- A heart attack.

53:38.608 --> 53:40.006
I heard you,
but I thought you said it was--

53:40.075 --> 53:42.009
Mom, Julian just punched me
in the arm.

53:42.077 --> 53:43.409
No, I didn't, liar.

53:43.479 --> 53:44.878
- Yes, you did!
- When is Daisy gonna be home?

53:44.947 --> 53:46.380
soon, honey.
Okay, we gotta go.

53:46.449 --> 53:48.541
Can you have her contact me as soon
as she's feeling better?

53:48.617 --> 53:50.141
Thanks. Hello?

53:50.218 --> 53:51.276
Hi there.

54:02.998 --> 54:04.898
?Mami?

54:04.966 --> 54:06.263
?Mami?

54:06.334 --> 54:08.893
Mmm.

54:08.969 --> 54:11.130
Frankie.

54:11.205 --> 54:13.936
- ?Donde esta Emilio?
- He's right here.

54:20.514 --> 54:23.745
- Did you eat something, hmm?
- Yeah.

54:25.219 --> 54:27.779
Please don't worry about us.
We're fine.

54:30.223 --> 54:31.520
Mmm.

54:32.960 --> 54:35.394
Hey, you gotta
take care of yourself, okay?

54:36.964 --> 54:39.625
We need you
to get better.

55:20.172 --> 55:22.002
You know how you try
and prepare yourself

55:22.073 --> 55:24.269
for things like this?

55:24.343 --> 55:26.334
Well, it never works.

55:26.411 --> 55:29.868
I can't even imagine
living life without my grandma.

55:29.947 --> 55:33.475
I thought she was
the strongest woman alive

55:33.552 --> 55:36.281
till I saw her
on that hospital bed.

55:36.354 --> 55:38.515
It made me so angry.

55:38.589 --> 55:40.819
I didn't know what to do.

55:40.891 --> 55:43.917
I didn't know who to blame.

55:45.629 --> 55:47.563
When we get to the gym,
grab Mr. T

55:47.631 --> 55:49.461
and take him
to your mom's house.

55:49.532 --> 55:52.627
I want it to be nice and peaceful
when Grandma gets home.

55:52.703 --> 55:55.797
He's been eating all her pillows.
He's stressing me out.

56:15.191 --> 56:16.886
Grab the bags.

56:16.960 --> 56:19.223
All of 'em?

56:19.294 --> 56:21.125
I guess that means yes.

56:30.139 --> 56:31.539
Good stroke.

56:32.908 --> 56:35.809
What's the matter, baby boy?

56:47.088 --> 56:48.851
Come on with it.

56:49.891 --> 56:51.587
Come on with it.

56:51.660 --> 56:53.992
That's it. One, two, three.

56:54.063 --> 56:56.496
- Oh, that's--
- This is stupid. I'm good.

56:56.564 --> 56:58.429
What the fuck is
the point of this, huh?

56:58.499 --> 57:00.660
- What are you talking about?
- You know what I'm talking about.

57:00.735 --> 57:02.327
You've been telling me
to bust my ass.

57:02.403 --> 57:04.303
Every single year, he's been
telling me to bust my ass.

57:04.372 --> 57:06.499
- "Do this, do that."
- Then quit.

57:06.574 --> 57:09.133
I never said
it was going to be easy.

57:09.209 --> 57:12.407
If you don't want to work for it,
there's nothing I can do about it.

57:12.480 --> 57:13.742
Quit. Go ahead, quit.

57:13.815 --> 57:15.873
Okay.

57:15.949 --> 57:17.746
"This year we're gonna go
to the Golden Gloves.

57:17.818 --> 57:19.547
This year we're going
to go to the Golden Gloves."

57:19.619 --> 57:21.554
Fuck that!

58:18.243 --> 58:22.202
I remember that. I fucked up a guy
over there the other day.

58:22.280 --> 58:23.747
Remember that shit?

58:23.815 --> 58:25.214
- That shit over there?
- Oh, fuck that.

58:25.283 --> 58:27.649
Oh my God, dude.

58:27.719 --> 58:29.811
I always forget
about that fuckin'--

58:29.887 --> 58:31.253
What the fuck?

58:31.322 --> 58:33.051
Hey, yo, you got a fuckin'
death wish or something, nigga?

58:33.124 --> 58:34.921
- Yeah, bitch.
- What? You mother--

58:34.992 --> 58:37.187
- Oh shit!
- Cono.

58:37.261 --> 58:39.024
- Fuck, E!
- Look at this fuckin' guy.

58:39.096 --> 58:41.031
- Oh, E, you got big as fuck.
- Fuck, man.

58:41.099 --> 58:43.225
- What's up, man?
- God damn.

58:43.300 --> 58:45.291
Hey, but don't fuckin'
get it twisted, bro.

58:45.369 --> 58:46.700
I'll still knock your shit out.

58:46.770 --> 58:48.635
You okay, bro?
What you been up to?

58:48.705 --> 58:50.832
- Working with my uncle and shit.
- Yeah, boxing bullshit?

58:50.908 --> 58:52.500
Yeah, I thought you
were locked up, nigga.

58:52.576 --> 58:54.669
shit, I was, bro.
But you know me, nigga.

58:54.745 --> 58:56.769
Out and free like a bird, bro.

58:56.846 --> 58:58.814
Going to a party tonight,
that pinga.

58:58.881 --> 59:00.679
Yo, you coming?

59:00.751 --> 59:01.945
Take a sip, man.
Let's go, man.

59:02.019 --> 59:03.680
Bro, easy Cuban girls.
Bro, let's go.

59:03.753 --> 59:06.244
Talkin'? Walk. Go go,
these fucking girls are easy, man.

59:06.322 --> 59:08.654
- Come on, man.
- Even Beto's gonna get laid, bro.

59:08.724 --> 59:11.352
I always get laid. Yo, I fucked
suzy right by that little tree.

59:11.427 --> 59:13.122
Oh my God, the same
suzy bullshit, bro.

59:13.196 --> 59:15.426
- That shit was over 10 years ago.
- I had her right there.

59:15.498 --> 59:17.557
- What are you talkin' about?
- Open your eye, nigga.

59:17.633 --> 59:19.533
Brother is getting down
with these fuckin' Haitian niggas.

59:19.602 --> 59:21.035
Go, yo.

59:21.103 --> 59:22.764
Watch-- watch how--

59:22.838 --> 59:25.897
Watch-- oh, we got wasted!

59:25.974 --> 59:29.934
Chug chug chug.

59:31.113 --> 59:34.081
Ahh! Ahhh!

59:34.149 --> 59:36.549
That's what
I'm talking about, baby.

59:36.618 --> 59:38.518
Yo, finish that shit.
Come on now!

59:38.587 --> 59:39.849
Come on, Beto.

59:39.921 --> 59:41.889
- Come on now, yeah!
- Drink it, drink it!

59:58.405 --> 01:00:00.431
Esta bien, esta bien.

01:00:06.046 --> 01:00:07.604
Chill the fuck out, homie.

01:00:07.681 --> 01:00:10.377
- What the fuck you doin', nigga?
- shut the fuck up.

01:00:15.356 --> 01:00:18.883
Hey, dog, yo!
Chill out, man. Fuck, dog!

01:00:18.959 --> 01:00:20.859
That's what I'm
talking about, baby--

01:00:20.928 --> 01:00:22.759
fucking bitches
and getting high.

01:00:22.830 --> 01:00:24.353
Here, take that shit.

01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:26.557
- Yeah, I'll take this shit.
- Hit it, hit it. Hell yeah.

01:00:26.633 --> 01:00:27.759
Hold it, hold it.

01:00:27.834 --> 01:00:30.428
Yeah, dog, you're fuckin'
wasting your time

01:00:30.503 --> 01:00:32.130
with that boxing bullshit, dog.

01:00:32.205 --> 01:00:33.968
Hey, slow that shit down.
My uncle's been trying--

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:35.632
Fuck you and fuck your uncle, dog.

01:00:35.708 --> 01:00:37.675
This is your fuckin' family here.

01:00:37.743 --> 01:00:41.271
Emilio, I just want to tell you--

01:00:41.347 --> 01:00:43.144
I want to tell you

01:00:43.216 --> 01:00:45.683
that I love you.

01:00:45.751 --> 01:00:47.912
You're my family.

01:00:47.986 --> 01:00:49.648
And you're my family.

01:00:49.722 --> 01:00:53.316
And I will fuckin'--
I will fuckin' die for you.

01:00:53.392 --> 01:00:55.292
I fuckin' don't care anymore.

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:57.624
Is this nigga crying?

01:00:57.696 --> 01:01:00.529
I don't cry. I get high.

01:01:00.599 --> 01:01:03.762
- Let me see that blunt, man.
- Hell yeah, Beto.

01:01:03.835 --> 01:01:05.427
That's what I'm talking about, baby.

01:01:05.504 --> 01:01:07.835
- We are back.
- I don't feel good right now, man.

01:01:10.509 --> 01:01:12.374
Holy shit, dog.
Check that shit out.

01:01:12.444 --> 01:01:14.138
What?

01:01:15.179 --> 01:01:16.840
Oh shit.

01:01:20.052 --> 01:01:22.611
Oh, that is some porno shit
right there, man.

01:01:22.687 --> 01:01:24.655
Fuck that bitch hard.

01:01:24.722 --> 01:01:27.156
That would be some gangster shit
if we fuckin' run the train on that bitch

01:01:27.224 --> 01:01:28.885
right in front of her fuckin' boyfriend.

01:01:28.959 --> 01:01:30.984
Fuck yeah, man, I'll make
that bitch suck my fuckin' dick.

01:01:31.062 --> 01:01:33.394
Hey, Beto, you're drunk.
sergio, let's ride, man.

01:01:33.464 --> 01:01:35.863
- What, are you fucking scared?
- I ain't scared of shit, dog.

01:01:35.932 --> 01:01:38.163
Yo, man, I'm down for whatever.
I don't give a fuck right now.

01:01:38.235 --> 01:01:41.466
That's what's up, Beto. We're about to go
fuckin' fuck that bitch nasty style.

01:01:41.539 --> 01:01:43.005
- serge, this is crazy.

01:01:43.073 --> 01:01:44.597

01:01:44.674 --> 01:01:46.699

01:01:46.776 --> 01:01:48.176
Beto.

01:01:48.245 --> 01:01:50.838
iQue pinga, maricon!

01:01:50.914 --> 01:01:52.939

01:01:53.016 --> 01:01:55.246
Beto-- you fucking chinga.

01:01:55.318 --> 01:01:57.547
Huh? ?Huh, maricon?

01:01:57.619 --> 01:01:59.713
Beto, fuck him up.
Come here, you fucking whore.

01:01:59.789 --> 01:02:01.484
- No, don't! stop it!

01:02:01.558 --> 01:02:02.684

01:02:02.759 --> 01:02:04.089
- No!

01:02:04.159 --> 01:02:06.593
- No!
- You want a fuck in an alley?

01:02:06.662 --> 01:02:08.563
- Huh?
- No, stop it! Jeffrey!

01:02:08.631 --> 01:02:10.394
- Huh?
- No! Jeffrey!

01:02:10.467 --> 01:02:11.990

01:02:12.067 --> 01:02:14.399
You like that shit?
Huh?

01:02:14.470 --> 01:02:16.734
You fucking like that?

01:02:16.805 --> 01:02:20.070
You scream one more time,
I'm gonna fuck you up.

01:02:20.142 --> 01:02:22.872

you fuckin' stupid bitch.

01:02:22.945 --> 01:02:25.970
Emilio?
Emilio, what the fuck, man?

01:02:27.315 --> 01:02:29.978
sergio? What the fuck
are you doin', bro?

01:02:31.387 --> 01:02:33.251
- Emilio, man.
- Get the fuck out of here.

01:02:33.321 --> 01:02:35.812
- No, we gotta get Emilio.
- Hey, fuck Emilio. Let's go.

01:02:35.890 --> 01:02:37.552
We gotta get Emilio.

01:03:08.622 --> 01:03:09.919
Manny!

01:03:18.799 --> 01:03:21.927
Hello? We're home.

01:03:22.002 --> 01:03:23.491
- Mami.
- Ay, mi amor.

01:03:23.569 --> 01:03:26.299
- Mamita.
- ?Como estas?

01:03:26.372 --> 01:03:27.840
Welcome home.

01:03:27.908 --> 01:03:29.773
Thank you.

01:03:29.843 --> 01:03:32.504
Come on up.
You sit down and relax.

01:03:32.578 --> 01:03:34.637
Okay okay.

01:03:34.713 --> 01:03:37.443
What are you making?
Arroz con pollo?

01:03:37.516 --> 01:03:39.950
Remember not to...

01:03:40.019 --> 01:03:42.715
- overheat the sofrito...
- si si.

01:03:42.788 --> 01:03:44.187
This is what I got to put up with.

01:03:44.256 --> 01:03:45.483
Well, if you don't want her,
we'll keep her.

01:03:45.557 --> 01:03:47.890
No no no, you kept her
for a week, okay?

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.951
Now she's all mine.

01:03:50.029 --> 01:03:51.621
Okay. Well bye, Daisy.
Take care.

01:03:51.696 --> 01:03:52.890
- Bye bye.
- Bye now.

01:03:52.964 --> 01:03:54.454
Thank you.

01:03:56.502 --> 01:03:58.333
I didn't know you could cook.

01:03:58.404 --> 01:04:00.234
It's my specialty, vieja.

01:04:00.305 --> 01:04:01.738
Are you hungry?

01:04:01.806 --> 01:04:05.902
Yeah, I'm hungry
after all that food in the hospital.

01:04:05.977 --> 01:04:08.070
It's so bad.

01:04:08.146 --> 01:04:11.775
Ay Dios... Where's Emilio?

01:04:13.717 --> 01:04:15.446
Frank?

01:04:16.488 --> 01:04:18.479
Where's Emilio?

01:04:21.391 --> 01:04:23.154
Frankie?

01:04:25.462 --> 01:04:27.397
What happened?

01:04:27.465 --> 01:04:29.455
?Que paso?

01:04:29.533 --> 01:04:32.468
Mami, Emilio tried
to commit suicide.

01:04:32.536 --> 01:04:34.629
?Que? No.

01:04:34.705 --> 01:04:36.502
Mi Emilio, no.

01:04:36.573 --> 01:04:38.837
- Mami, please.
- No. Where is he? Where is he?

01:04:38.909 --> 01:04:41.173
- Tell me where he is right now.
- Mami.

01:04:41.245 --> 01:04:43.439
He's at the south Miami
Psychiatric Hospital.

01:04:43.513 --> 01:04:45.777
Take me there right now.
Take me there right now.

01:04:45.849 --> 01:04:48.113
- Take me there right now.
- Mami, mami, we can't go.

01:04:48.185 --> 01:04:50.379
We can't go.
They're holding him for 14 days, okay?

01:04:50.453 --> 01:04:54.355
- We'll go get him on Friday.
- Ay, Dios mio...

01:04:54.423 --> 01:04:56.051
It's gonna be okay, mami.

01:04:56.126 --> 01:04:57.558
Mami, it's going to be okay.

01:05:43.904 --> 01:05:46.169
All right, so you want--
all right, how do we do--

01:05:46.241 --> 01:05:49.232
paper, rock, scissors.
Okay, so you do it three?

01:05:49.310 --> 01:05:50.902
Paper, rock, scissor.

01:05:50.978 --> 01:05:52.843
Paper, rock, scissor.

01:05:52.913 --> 01:05:54.277
Damn.

01:05:54.347 --> 01:05:56.646
Paper, rock, scissor.
Oh, I got you.

01:05:56.717 --> 01:05:59.345
- Hey, what's that? Bam!
- Oh!

01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:01.683
Come on, man, you're a boxer.

01:06:01.754 --> 01:06:03.619
You're a boxer
and you go for that?

01:06:03.690 --> 01:06:05.215
That's a cheap shot, man.

01:06:05.292 --> 01:06:07.317
My uncle does
the same thing, Manny.

01:06:08.528 --> 01:06:10.519
Wait up, have you ever
wondered about this?

01:06:10.597 --> 01:06:13.065
How does--
how does paper beat rock?

01:06:13.132 --> 01:06:15.431
- You could just--
- Well, it covers it.

01:06:15.502 --> 01:06:17.264
Paper covers it.
You know what I mean?

01:06:17.337 --> 01:06:20.568
It's kind of like boxing.
You swarm over somebody.

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:23.107
You clinch them up,
they can't really hit you.

01:06:23.175 --> 01:06:24.608
You told me you used to box, right?

01:06:24.676 --> 01:06:26.645
Yeah yeah, a long time. Yeah.

01:06:26.713 --> 01:06:28.578
- How was it?
- It was tough.

01:06:28.648 --> 01:06:30.342
A tough way to make a living.

01:06:30.415 --> 01:06:33.384
You know what I mean?
But sometimes that's all you got.

01:06:35.154 --> 01:06:37.122
Everybody just
take your seats.

01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:39.384
Is the mother here?

01:06:39.458 --> 01:06:41.790
We are his mother-- his family.

01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:44.294
Okay, well, thank you for coming.

01:06:44.363 --> 01:06:47.332
It's important that everyone
who's close to Emilio

01:06:47.399 --> 01:06:51.335
and part of his life
be part of his treatment.

01:06:51.403 --> 01:06:53.666
Treatment?

01:06:53.738 --> 01:06:57.072
Emilio has been diagnosed
with Bipolar ll,

01:06:57.142 --> 01:06:58.734
with suicidal ideation.

01:06:58.809 --> 01:07:01.573
But the good news is it's treatable.

01:07:01.646 --> 01:07:03.409
And Emilio's a good kid.

01:07:03.481 --> 01:07:06.348
He'll just need your love
and support to get through it.

01:07:06.417 --> 01:07:08.442
Now I'm going to up
the dosage of lithium

01:07:08.519 --> 01:07:11.181
And that'll help
control the mood swings.

01:07:11.255 --> 01:07:14.018
And Manny here will
continue his counseling

01:07:14.090 --> 01:07:15.649
and monitor his progress.

01:07:16.694 --> 01:07:17.888
Him?

01:07:17.962 --> 01:07:19.429
si, senora.

01:07:22.699 --> 01:07:25.430
And just so you're aware,
Bipolar ll is a disorder

01:07:25.503 --> 01:07:28.733
that manifests itself
with periods of insomnia,

01:07:28.805 --> 01:07:32.366
anxiety, high stress, manic states.

01:07:32.442 --> 01:07:36.208
Be very sure he doesn't miss any
of his scheduled medications.

01:07:36.279 --> 01:07:37.678
And I'll keep an eye on him,

01:07:37.747 --> 01:07:40.409
check back in with you guys
every 30 days.

01:07:53.361 --> 01:07:56.728
Mr. Portillo, your 1 :00 is here.

01:07:56.798 --> 01:07:58.789
Grace, who's my 1 :00?

01:07:58.866 --> 01:08:00.800
A rep from T Promotions?

01:08:00.868 --> 01:08:03.302
They have a fighter
they want you to see.

01:08:03.371 --> 01:08:07.467
I don't know anyone
from T Promotions. send them away.

01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:09.510
she's a female.

01:08:12.079 --> 01:08:13.570
Is she attractive?

01:08:13.648 --> 01:08:15.240
Yes.

01:08:16.718 --> 01:08:18.479
send her in.

01:08:28.161 --> 01:08:31.187
Hello, Mr. Portillo.
I'm Talia Portillo.

01:08:31.264 --> 01:08:33.390
I'm the president of T Promotions.

01:08:33.466 --> 01:08:35.901
What can I do for you, Miss Portillo?

01:08:35.969 --> 01:08:38.062
Well, I have the best boxer
in Miami Dade,

01:08:38.138 --> 01:08:40.298
and I want him to fight
the Golden Gloves champion

01:08:40.372 --> 01:08:42.897
in an exhibition to help raise money
for Frank's Boxing Gym.

01:08:42.975 --> 01:08:45.809
Well, Miss Portillo,

01:08:45.879 --> 01:08:48.608
your proposition is very interesting.

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:52.617
But we're not interested
in saving a fledgling boxing gym

01:08:52.685 --> 01:08:55.483
or fighting a boxer
with suicidal tendencies.

01:08:56.822 --> 01:08:59.086
I could have beat that guy
that fought Teddy, okay?

01:08:59.158 --> 01:09:00.386
That doesn't matter.

01:09:00.459 --> 01:09:02.392
Golden Gloves says he's the best

01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:04.224
and now we're moving
to Junior Olympics.

01:09:04.296 --> 01:09:06.127
- I can't believe you're--
- The answer is no.

01:09:06.198 --> 01:09:08.223
- You're not even letting me finish.
- Talia.

01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:10.698
You are irritating me.

01:09:10.769 --> 01:09:12.600
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

01:09:12.670 --> 01:09:15.231
There's no way Teddy
is going to fight Emilio.

01:09:15.307 --> 01:09:18.036
so for now,

01:09:18.109 --> 01:09:19.837
have a good day.

01:10:12.496 --> 01:10:15.396
Ah, there he is!

01:10:15.464 --> 01:10:16.726
?Que pasa?

01:10:16.799 --> 01:10:18.266
It's great to have you here.

01:10:18.334 --> 01:10:20.563
so how do you feel?

01:10:22.338 --> 01:10:23.930
Great.

01:10:24.006 --> 01:10:26.440
What have you been up to?

01:10:26.509 --> 01:10:28.908
Uh, sleeping.

01:10:28.977 --> 01:10:31.241
Hey, you want to train?

01:10:36.218 --> 01:10:39.016
Tio, where's, um--

01:10:39.087 --> 01:10:41.681
where's-- where's Mr. T?

01:10:41.756 --> 01:10:43.451
Oh, Mr. T?
Talia took him.

01:10:43.525 --> 01:10:44.856
Why?

01:10:44.926 --> 01:10:47.918
'Cause he wouldn't
stop crying since, you know,

01:10:47.996 --> 01:10:51.396
and he ate my shoes. And he was
barking at the people in the gym.

01:10:51.465 --> 01:10:54.629
Uh, you didn't tell him
anything, right? About--

01:10:54.703 --> 01:10:56.795
Nah, I didn't tell him.
I didn't tell him.

01:10:56.871 --> 01:10:58.463
He also ate some
of my new equipment,

01:10:58.539 --> 01:11:01.440
- so Talia came by and took him.
- Probably didn't feel good.

01:11:01.508 --> 01:11:03.409
He did once he saw Talia.

01:11:03.478 --> 01:11:05.468
I don't know,
but I think he's in love.

01:11:05.546 --> 01:11:07.810
He might be trying
to steal your girl.

01:11:07.882 --> 01:11:10.180
Well, she's not my girl.

01:11:10.251 --> 01:11:11.946
That's not what I heard.

01:11:12.019 --> 01:11:13.987
He said that if you don't
make your move fast,

01:11:14.054 --> 01:11:15.612
he's gonna take her.

01:11:15.689 --> 01:11:18.282
Ah! Did I see a smile?

01:11:20.593 --> 01:11:22.960
- Oh! Hey, T!
- Hey.

01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:25.657
Hey, bud! Hi!

01:11:25.732 --> 01:11:29.361
Hi!

01:11:31.204 --> 01:11:33.001
Good boy!
Go over there.

01:11:36.075 --> 01:11:39.771
- Hey.
- That's all I get? "Hey"?

01:11:39.845 --> 01:11:43.373
Guys, let's...

01:11:48.787 --> 01:11:50.721
You look good.

01:11:50.789 --> 01:11:52.951
Yeah.

01:11:54.493 --> 01:11:56.484
Where's my bag?

01:11:59.498 --> 01:12:01.523
What's going on?

01:12:04.770 --> 01:12:07.933
Just, uh, packing up my stuff.

01:12:08.006 --> 01:12:10.269
Why?

01:12:10.341 --> 01:12:12.469
'Cause I'm done, okay?

01:12:12.544 --> 01:12:14.808
You're quitting?

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:17.279
Yeah, I'm quitting. I'm quitting,
if that's what you want to call it.

01:12:17.348 --> 01:12:19.680
I'm quitting.

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:23.687
Okay, what do you want to do?

01:12:26.724 --> 01:12:29.318
I don't know.

01:12:29.393 --> 01:12:31.987
I think I'm gonna get a job,

01:12:32.063 --> 01:12:34.224
help my grandma out.

01:12:34.298 --> 01:12:35.890
I'm tired of being broke.

01:12:35.967 --> 01:12:38.196
What kind of job
do you want to get?

01:12:41.372 --> 01:12:44.966
something legit, like a real job.

01:12:45.041 --> 01:12:47.771
I was thinking like Wendy's

01:12:47.844 --> 01:12:49.778
or Burger King.

01:12:49.846 --> 01:12:51.905
Burger King has a good
pension plan, so that's--

01:12:51.982 --> 01:12:54.041
Yeah no, yeah.
If those don't work out,

01:12:54.117 --> 01:12:57.518
you could sell Girl scout cookies
or something.

01:12:57.587 --> 01:13:01.045
You could, like, wear the outfit,
like a beret and badges.

01:13:03.259 --> 01:13:05.193
Do you want me to help you?

01:13:05.261 --> 01:13:07.091
No.

01:13:07.162 --> 01:13:09.596
No, I don't need
your help. I'm good.

01:13:14.603 --> 01:13:19.336
I'm gonna take, um, Mr. T
to my mom's house for a couple days

01:13:19.408 --> 01:13:22.002
so I can figure things out,
you know?

01:13:22.077 --> 01:13:23.806
Do you need a ride?

01:13:23.879 --> 01:13:27.042
No. I'm good.
I'm gonna walk.

01:13:29.283 --> 01:13:31.343
I wanted to thank you
for taking care of Mr. T.

01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:33.388
I just wanted to let you know
that I appreciate that.

01:13:33.455 --> 01:13:35.547
Oh yeah, it was--
it was no problem.

01:13:35.623 --> 01:13:39.081
Actually, he was the one
that was taking care of me.

01:13:41.963 --> 01:13:44.625
He told me to tell you

01:13:44.699 --> 01:13:47.190
that he knows things
are really tough right now,

01:13:47.268 --> 01:13:49.964
but that they're going
to get better.

01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:55.798
That was just something
that he said to me.

01:14:00.314 --> 01:14:02.646
Okay well, come on, T.
Come on.

01:14:34.447 --> 01:14:37.007
Un poquito de whiskey.

01:14:37.083 --> 01:14:39.245
Just like old times.

01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:43.179
Whoa. What--

01:14:43.255 --> 01:14:44.847
wow.

01:14:44.924 --> 01:14:47.084
Wait, don't tell me.

01:14:47.158 --> 01:14:49.627
You're Emilio.

01:14:50.663 --> 01:14:52.460
Wow, you're big, man.

01:14:52.531 --> 01:14:56.159
Don't tell me that's T.

01:14:57.202 --> 01:14:58.567
Mr. T.

01:14:58.636 --> 01:15:01.037
Wow, you both are big.

01:15:02.273 --> 01:15:05.504
What the fuck
are you doing here?

01:15:05.577 --> 01:15:07.010
What do you mean?

01:15:07.078 --> 01:15:09.546
What do I mean?
Where's my mom?

01:15:09.614 --> 01:15:12.674
she went to the store
to get some groceries.

01:15:12.750 --> 01:15:14.513
she'll be right back.

01:15:17.554 --> 01:15:18.920
Get out.

01:15:20.225 --> 01:15:21.522
What?

01:15:21.593 --> 01:15:22.582
Get out.

01:15:22.659 --> 01:15:23.683
I'm sorry?

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:25.990
T, go to your room.

01:15:26.063 --> 01:15:27.462
All right, all right,
listen listen,

01:15:27.531 --> 01:15:29.124
I don't want any trouble, okay?

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:32.532
You don't have to come in here
and disrespect me, really.

01:15:32.603 --> 01:15:34.503
You're a fucking piece of shit.

01:15:34.571 --> 01:15:37.039
I want you to stay away
from my mom, you hear me?

01:15:37.106 --> 01:15:39.632
All right, all right.
You know what?

01:15:42.713 --> 01:15:45.306
Okay.

01:15:45.381 --> 01:15:48.374
I'm gonna be the big man

01:15:48.452 --> 01:15:50.386
and I'm gonna walk away.

01:15:50.454 --> 01:15:51.943
smart move.

01:15:52.021 --> 01:15:53.716
Just you remember something.

01:15:55.191 --> 01:15:57.318
I was young then

01:15:57.393 --> 01:15:59.190
and I wasn't perfect,

01:15:59.262 --> 01:16:01.162
so I fucked up.

01:16:02.198 --> 01:16:03.426
But you know what?

01:16:03.499 --> 01:16:05.433
You fucked up too,
you little punk.

01:16:05.501 --> 01:16:07.525
I don't give a fuck. If you come
anywhere near my mom

01:16:07.602 --> 01:16:09.537
- and I will fucking kill you.
- You're gonna kill me?

01:16:09.605 --> 01:16:12.073
- Oh my God!
- Wow, he's gonna kill me.

01:16:12.141 --> 01:16:13.573
Tomas, he just came to say hi.

01:16:13.642 --> 01:16:15.075
Yeah,
I just came by to say hi.

01:16:15.143 --> 01:16:17.976
- Keep your fucking mouth shut.
- No problem, chief.

01:16:18.047 --> 01:16:19.981
No problem.

01:16:20.049 --> 01:16:22.016
I'm gone. Adios.

01:16:22.083 --> 01:16:23.482
You're not staying
for dinner?

01:16:23.552 --> 01:16:24.883
No, he's leaving right now.

01:16:24.953 --> 01:16:26.750
Lydia, it was nice to see you.

01:16:26.821 --> 01:16:28.345
Um, I gotta go.

01:16:28.423 --> 01:16:30.653
Okay.
Nice to see you too.

01:16:30.725 --> 01:16:33.785
Hey hey, you don't still
have that little knife

01:16:33.862 --> 01:16:36.125
- that you used--
- No, I don't have that little knife.

01:16:36.197 --> 01:16:38.359
- I don't need it no more.
- Tomas!

01:16:43.404 --> 01:16:45.463
Papi, I'm sorry.

01:16:45.539 --> 01:16:47.131
He just came to say hi.

01:16:47.208 --> 01:16:48.938
What does he do?
His mom is dying

01:16:49.010 --> 01:16:51.136
- and his sister's in the hospital.
- I don't care.

01:16:51.212 --> 01:16:54.010
- I don't-- I don't.
- Okay.

01:16:54.081 --> 01:16:55.708
I just want to know
if it's okay if Mr. T

01:16:55.783 --> 01:16:57.249
can stay here
for a couple of days.

01:16:57.317 --> 01:16:59.786
Of course.
Whatever you want.

01:17:02.623 --> 01:17:04.647
I've been praying for you.

01:17:04.724 --> 01:17:07.158
I'm just really glad
that you're okay.

01:17:07.227 --> 01:17:10.924
Well, I'm very far
from being okay,

01:17:10.997 --> 01:17:13.227
but we're going to keep T here.

01:17:13.299 --> 01:17:15.597
I'll come back tomorrow
and everything is going to be okay.

01:17:15.668 --> 01:17:18.262
Okay. Okay, no no,
I'll take care of him, okay?

01:17:18.338 --> 01:17:19.327
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:17:19.405 --> 01:17:21.999
Mi vida.

01:17:22.075 --> 01:17:23.042
Okay.

01:17:37.423 --> 01:17:38.947
Dad?

01:17:44.396 --> 01:17:46.296
shit.

01:17:47.633 --> 01:17:49.498
Oh fuck.

01:17:50.535 --> 01:17:52.332
Talia, wait.

01:17:52.404 --> 01:17:54.564
It's not what it--

01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:59.133
Listen, I'm sorry
you had to see that.

01:17:59.211 --> 01:18:00.405
No, you're sorry
you got caught.

01:18:00.479 --> 01:18:01.672
Talia, please.

01:18:01.746 --> 01:18:04.647
Let her call Daddy
and break his heart.

01:18:04.715 --> 01:18:05.909
she won't do it.

01:18:05.983 --> 01:18:08.111
Bitch, you think you mean
anything to him?

01:18:08.186 --> 01:18:09.948
Benjamin worships me.

01:18:10.021 --> 01:18:13.479
Your expiration date
is long past due.

01:18:13.557 --> 01:18:17.152
Talia, hey, look at me.

01:18:18.296 --> 01:18:20.924
I'll do anything.

01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:32.708
Hey, Ben, how you doin'?

01:18:36.212 --> 01:18:38.578
I don't know what she did,

01:18:38.648 --> 01:18:40.741
but she got me
a fight with Teddy.

01:18:40.817 --> 01:18:43.012
Talk about bad timing.

01:18:45.921 --> 01:18:48.891
I'm terrified of getting
inside that ring with Teddy.

01:18:51.127 --> 01:18:54.618
All I could think about
was getting knocked out.

01:18:54.697 --> 01:18:57.531
I had this feeling
that he was going to kill me.

01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:01.000
My uncle said this is my moment.

01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:03.265
It's either now or never.

01:21:17.701 --> 01:21:19.430
I know that.
I already know that.

01:21:19.503 --> 01:21:21.494
I do that on purpose.

01:21:21.572 --> 01:21:23.334
I'm a counterpuncher.
That's what I do. I let the guy

01:21:23.406 --> 01:21:25.602
throw one punch and I throw four
or five right after it.

01:21:25.676 --> 01:21:27.837
- I use it as bait.
- Teddy's different, okay?

01:21:27.911 --> 01:21:30.811
He hits hard,
maybe even harder than you do.

01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:33.246
so just try to keep
that pretty face pretty.

01:21:35.118 --> 01:21:37.278
What-- what is this?

01:21:39.055 --> 01:21:40.613
Are you--

01:21:40.690 --> 01:21:43.090
are you my girlfriend?
I just want to know

01:21:43.159 --> 01:21:45.491
'cause I never had a girlfriend,
so I just want to know.

01:21:45.561 --> 01:21:46.926
This is so corny.

01:21:46.996 --> 01:21:49.556
Okay, look, just relax.
Calm down.

01:21:53.768 --> 01:21:55.737
I'm with you.

01:21:55.805 --> 01:21:57.898
That's all you need to know.

01:22:22.563 --> 01:22:23.825
Okay.

01:22:23.898 --> 01:22:25.696
- No.
- Where are you going?

01:22:25.767 --> 01:22:29.167
- No!
- Get back here, Emilio.

01:22:29.236 --> 01:22:31.170
stop.
Where are you going?

01:22:31.238 --> 01:22:33.365
Do you want me
to wait for you?

01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:36.671
No no, I'm good.
I'm gonna go see how T is doing

01:22:36.744 --> 01:22:39.406
- and check up on my mom.
- Okay.

01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:41.072
- Night.
- Good night.

01:22:41.148 --> 01:22:42.774
Good night.

01:22:44.084 --> 01:22:45.312
Really?

01:22:45.386 --> 01:22:47.320
What? You have
a fight tomorrow.

01:22:49.756 --> 01:22:52.054
I had a good night though.

01:22:52.125 --> 01:22:53.353
- I did too.
- Thank you.

01:22:53.426 --> 01:22:54.758
Good night.

01:23:06.573 --> 01:23:09.167
What happened?

01:23:10.243 --> 01:23:11.834
Nada.

01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:13.742
What happened
to your face?

01:23:13.813 --> 01:23:15.906
I, uh, l--

01:23:15.982 --> 01:23:18.313
- Tomas came. He--
- To--

01:23:18.383 --> 01:23:21.682
No se.
He-- he wanted money

01:23:21.753 --> 01:23:23.517
and he went crazy.

01:23:23.590 --> 01:23:26.922
And he hit me by accident.

01:23:26.992 --> 01:23:30.393
And-- and Mr. T--

01:23:30.462 --> 01:23:31.827
- he wanted to protect me.
- What?

01:23:31.897 --> 01:23:34.365
Mr. T wanted
to protect me, papi.

01:23:34.433 --> 01:23:36.594
And he got in the way
and I'm sorry.

01:23:36.668 --> 01:23:38.568
T?

01:24:21.611 --> 01:24:23.169
- Lydia?
- Frank,

01:24:23.246 --> 01:24:25.111
- I'm taking Mr. T to a hospital.
- What?

01:24:25.181 --> 01:24:27.308
- Emilio's going to kill Tomas.
- slow down. What?

01:24:27.384 --> 01:24:29.715
- I'm gonna call the cops.
- Don't call the cops. Let me handle it.

01:24:29.785 --> 01:24:31.753
- I gotta go.
- Then why the hell did you call me for?

01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:33.721
- Hurry up.
- Fuck!

01:24:34.958 --> 01:24:36.892
You know we always
need ears to help us out.

01:24:36.959 --> 01:24:38.893
Montes?

01:24:43.533 --> 01:24:44.726
Hey, Frank.

01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:46.961
What are you doing here?

01:24:47.036 --> 01:24:49.197
Lydia called me.
Where's Emilio?

01:24:51.305 --> 01:24:52.830
Hopefully training.

01:24:52.908 --> 01:24:54.375
He's not here?

01:24:54.443 --> 01:24:56.104
No.

01:24:57.212 --> 01:24:58.769
Frank, is everything all right?

01:24:58.846 --> 01:25:01.906
Yeah, I'm good.
What happened?

01:25:03.052 --> 01:25:05.111
Tomas finally got
what was coming to him.

01:25:05.187 --> 01:25:07.586
There was an argument
over a dime bag.

01:25:07.655 --> 01:25:10.385
Only this time he got stabbed
in the face and neck.

01:25:13.127 --> 01:25:15.789
Frank, is everything
all right with Emilio?

01:25:15.863 --> 01:25:18.923
Yeah, everything's great.

01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:47.852
Hey, champ.

01:25:47.928 --> 01:25:49.952
What's going on?

01:25:55.068 --> 01:25:57.399
Mr. T's going to be okay.

01:25:57.470 --> 01:25:59.529
He's a tough boy.

01:26:02.409 --> 01:26:05.138
I went there to kill him.

01:26:06.979 --> 01:26:09.470
But you didn't.

01:26:11.249 --> 01:26:14.219
Right after I won the title,

01:26:14.286 --> 01:26:17.517
I had everything--
money, fame.

01:26:18.890 --> 01:26:21.724
On your grandmother's birthday,

01:26:21.794 --> 01:26:24.092
we were going to take her
out to celebrate.

01:26:24.163 --> 01:26:26.653
so I went by your mom's house
to pick her up.

01:26:26.731 --> 01:26:30.063
And I see a bunch
of people standing outside.

01:26:30.134 --> 01:26:32.932
And I hear her screaming.

01:26:33.003 --> 01:26:35.028
so I rushed in.

01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:38.904
And I find your mama
all bloodied up

01:26:38.976 --> 01:26:41.536
and her boyfriend
just standing there.

01:26:41.612 --> 01:26:43.603
And I went at him.

01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:46.671
I started hitting him
and hitting him.

01:26:48.317 --> 01:26:51.082
All my training,
all my dedication

01:26:51.155 --> 01:26:52.679
went out the window.

01:26:52.756 --> 01:26:55.053
I lost myself that night.

01:26:55.124 --> 01:26:58.321
And everything I had
was taken away from me.

01:27:00.496 --> 01:27:03.329
Look, I can't tell you what to do.

01:27:03.399 --> 01:27:06.425
But whatever you do
decide to do,

01:27:06.502 --> 01:27:08.594
you do it for yourself.

01:27:08.670 --> 01:27:10.194
You don't do it for your mom

01:27:10.272 --> 01:27:12.969
or for your grandma
or even for me,

01:27:13.042 --> 01:27:14.566
but for yourself.

01:27:17.813 --> 01:27:20.111
You're gonna be okay.

01:27:42.604 --> 01:27:45.333
Hey, can you take this?

01:27:45.406 --> 01:27:47.340
Where do you want me to take it to?

01:27:47.408 --> 01:27:49.205
Aren't you a coat check?

01:27:49.276 --> 01:27:50.972
What's a coat check look like?

01:27:51.046 --> 01:27:54.310
Well, just like you.

01:28:08.027 --> 01:28:10.223
You told me you used to box,
right, Manny?

01:28:10.297 --> 01:28:12.231
- Yeah yeah, long time.
- How was it?

01:28:12.299 --> 01:28:14.289
It was tough. It was
a tough way to make a living.

01:28:14.367 --> 01:28:16.631
You know what I mean?
But sometimes that's all you got.

01:28:16.703 --> 01:28:19.729
You know, boxing is a lot
like a chess game.

01:28:19.806 --> 01:28:21.569
You've gotta be two
or three moves ahead.

01:28:21.641 --> 01:28:23.575
'Cause any time
you throw a punch,

01:28:23.643 --> 01:28:25.338
boom-- here comes
the counterpunch.

01:28:25.411 --> 01:28:27.571
You're gonna jab
with this punch, okay?

01:28:27.646 --> 01:28:30.741
All right. And then I'm going
to slip that jab, right?

01:28:30.817 --> 01:28:32.444
Now what? Now what?
Now they--

01:28:32.518 --> 01:28:34.644
boom! It's just bang bang!

01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:36.745
And it's like--
it's a real quick punch.

01:28:36.822 --> 01:28:38.790
But a lot of people can't do it

01:28:38.857 --> 01:28:41.452
'cause it's a hard punch to hit.

01:28:52.704 --> 01:28:54.467
Gentlemen.

01:28:54.539 --> 01:28:56.130
I'm looking for a good clean fight.

01:28:56.207 --> 01:28:57.799
No hitting below the belt,
no hitting behind the head.

01:28:57.875 --> 01:28:59.867
In case of a knockdown,
you're gonna go to your neutral corner

01:28:59.945 --> 01:29:01.344
and wait for further instructions.

01:29:01.413 --> 01:29:03.142
Any questions?
Any questions?

01:29:03.215 --> 01:29:05.239
Touch gloves,
come out fighting, gentlemen.

01:29:05.316 --> 01:29:06.647
I'm gonna fuck you up.

01:29:06.717 --> 01:29:09.185
I'm not gonna tell you again.

01:30:08.744 --> 01:30:11.076
spit it out.

01:30:11.146 --> 01:30:12.977
Now I want you to stop
moving around

01:30:13.048 --> 01:30:15.481
and make him feel your power.
Okay? He's got nothing on you.

01:30:15.550 --> 01:30:17.177
This guy's nothing.
He's got nobody.

01:30:17.251 --> 01:30:18.651
The only thing he has
is that left hook.

01:30:18.721 --> 01:30:20.154
That's it.
That's the only thing he's got.

01:30:20.222 --> 01:30:21.655
- You've gotta counter that.
- That's how he does it.

01:30:21.724 --> 01:30:23.554
He leaves himself open,
so nail the fuckin' guy.

01:30:23.624 --> 01:30:25.615
- Come on, let's go. You can do it.
- You can do it.

01:30:47.314 --> 01:30:49.579
Punk, I'm gonna nail ya.

01:31:19.079 --> 01:31:20.739
Come on, ref! Come on.

01:31:21.981 --> 01:31:23.744
Get up! Get up, Emilio!
Get up right now.

01:31:26.719 --> 01:31:28.277
Come on, get up!

01:31:28.354 --> 01:31:29.753
Get up. You can do it.

01:31:30.823 --> 01:31:31.915
Get up!

01:31:46.771 --> 01:31:49.535
Emilio?
Emilio, look at me.

01:31:49.607 --> 01:31:52.167
You've been working
your whole life for this moment.

01:31:52.243 --> 01:31:54.370
This is it, right now.

01:31:56.113 --> 01:31:58.241
I want you to take all that pain,

01:31:58.316 --> 01:32:01.251
all that hurt you got
inside of yourself,

01:32:01.319 --> 01:32:03.377
and make him feel it.

01:32:04.688 --> 01:32:09.058
Hey, you're a warrior.
Remember that.

01:32:10.761 --> 01:32:13.127
Be calm.

01:32:14.331 --> 01:32:15.821
Focus.

01:32:33.216 --> 01:32:35.013
Keep your hands up!

01:32:42.592 --> 01:32:45.459
Are you kidding me?
Ref, you didn't see that?

01:32:45.528 --> 01:32:47.428
Get up, get up!

01:32:47.497 --> 01:32:51.092
...three, four, five,

01:32:51.167 --> 01:32:53.397
six, seven.

01:32:53.469 --> 01:32:54.992
Take your time, Emilio.
Take your time.

01:32:58.741 --> 01:33:01.231
Ready? Fight.

01:34:50.248 --> 01:34:52.079
Are they feeding you over there?

01:34:52.149 --> 01:34:54.515
Eh? Because you know
those people-- they don't eat.

01:34:54.585 --> 01:34:57.554
And when they eat then they throw up
after so they can stay skinny.

01:34:57.622 --> 01:34:59.715
so you be careful.
You eat after you train

01:34:59.790 --> 01:35:02.384
- and before you train, okay?
- No, I ate already.

01:35:02.460 --> 01:35:04.984
Maybe I can send you something
over the mail. some food over the mail?

01:35:05.061 --> 01:35:07.462
No, you can't--
you can't mail food.

01:35:07.531 --> 01:35:09.556
They'll arrest you
over here. It's illegal.

01:35:09.634 --> 01:35:12.500
Okay okay okay,
here's your Uncle Frankie, okay?

01:35:12.569 --> 01:35:14.332
Okay, bye, mi amor. Bye bye.

01:35:14.404 --> 01:35:16.396
Hey champ!

01:35:16.474 --> 01:35:18.100
How's training coming along?

01:35:18.174 --> 01:35:20.802
Oye oye oye,
have you met any celebrities?

01:35:20.877 --> 01:35:23.437
No no, I haven't met
any celebrities yet.

01:35:23.513 --> 01:35:25.708
Well, I should be there
in a couple months,

01:35:25.782 --> 01:35:28.046
so I'll be seeing you soon,
God willing.

01:35:28.118 --> 01:35:31.315
Hey, I love you, man.
Call me.

01:35:34.823 --> 01:35:38.658
I'm so grateful for the people
I have in my life.

01:35:38.728 --> 01:35:41.321
- Thank you for not giving up on me.
- Come on, T, come on!

01:35:42.898 --> 01:35:46.300
I have no idea what to expect,

01:35:46.368 --> 01:35:49.826
but for the first time in my life,

01:35:49.905 --> 01:35:52.465
I'm excited about the future.
