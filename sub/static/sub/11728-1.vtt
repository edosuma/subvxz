01:28.955 --> 01:31.321
Great job, you guys.

01:31.357 --> 01:33.450
Has anyone seen Stacy?

01:35.428 --> 01:37.988
<i>Stacy?
Stacy, where are you guys?</i>

01:38.031 --> 01:40.465
<i>Oh, hey boss.
Table four. Come meet us.</i>

01:40.500 --> 01:42.593
Hey, did you check out
that cute guy by the Monet?

01:42.635 --> 01:44.330
<i>The one breathing on the Monet?</i>

01:44.370 --> 01:45.667
<i>I called security.</i>

01:45.705 --> 01:49.106
I think it's best to steer clear of him,
given my track record.

01:49.142 --> 01:50.268
Ooh, is that for me?

01:50.310 --> 01:51.937
- No, no, that's my...
- Thanks! I'm starving!

01:51.978 --> 01:54.674
The show is going great. To Beth!

01:54.714 --> 01:56.841
- Our fearless leader.
- Job well done.

01:56.883 --> 01:58.407
Thank you, guys.

01:58.451 --> 02:01.011
Oh, my God. Is that Brady Sacks?

02:01.054 --> 02:02.783
Beth's ex? Where?

02:02.822 --> 02:04.756
Not a funny joke.
And I'll tell you why.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.726
Because if Brady
had the nerve to show up here,

02:07.760 --> 02:09.818
I mean at my event, no less, after he...

02:09.863 --> 02:12.058
- Dumped you like yesterday's trash?
- Ripped your heart out

02:12.098 --> 02:13.326
and fed it to the Central Park pigeons?

02:13.366 --> 02:15.698
Come on, I'm not even
over your breakup yet.

02:15.735 --> 02:19.603
Well, I am, OK?
In a big way. Brady Sacks?

02:19.639 --> 02:21.732
Who cares?! That's what I say.

02:25.378 --> 02:26.902
He's right behind me, isn't he?

02:30.049 --> 02:33.018
- Brady...
- Oh, yeah...

02:35.054 --> 02:38.148
- Great show.
- Great show, guys.

02:43.530 --> 02:47.159
Uh, what are you doing here?

02:47.200 --> 02:48.827
Look, I know you're crazy busy,

02:48.868 --> 02:51.701
but there's something
I need to say to you.

02:51.738 --> 02:54.104
Something I think'll make up
for what I put you through.

02:55.542 --> 02:59.171
Uh... OK.

02:59.212 --> 03:01.874
I've got three words for you,
Beth Martin.

03:03.016 --> 03:07.146
- I was wrong.
- Did he just say he was wrong?

03:07.187 --> 03:09.747
A year ago, when I broke up
with you, I felt like

03:09.789 --> 03:12.087
you cared more about your work
than you did about me.

03:12.125 --> 03:14.685
Yeah, I remember, Brady, really clearly,

03:14.727 --> 03:17.252
when you broke up with me
in the Applebee's.

03:17.297 --> 03:20.289
I'm sorry about that,
but I'm here to tell you that...

03:21.868 --> 03:23.563
...I get it.
- Can you hear?

03:23.603 --> 03:25.628
Barely. I think he said he gets it.

03:25.672 --> 03:27.606
Oh, he gets it!

03:27.640 --> 03:32.339
I'm ready to jump in again,
in a big way.

03:32.378 --> 03:34.608
You want to jump in again?

03:36.382 --> 03:37.406
Yeah.

03:39.085 --> 03:40.575
Wow, uh...

03:40.620 --> 03:43.680
Yeah. I mean, maybe. If it's slow.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.123
You made me realize
that it doesn't matter

03:46.159 --> 03:51.028
how hard someone works,
as long as you love them enough.

03:51.864 --> 03:54.162
Yes. I can't believe
that you're saying that.

03:54.200 --> 03:55.929
I'm just a little overwhelmed.

03:55.969 --> 03:59.405
I met someone who works
just as hard as you do,

03:59.439 --> 04:02.272
only now I can accept her for that.

04:02.308 --> 04:05.402
- We're getting engaged!
- Beth's getting engaged!

04:05.445 --> 04:07.242
Did I just hear that right?

04:07.280 --> 04:09.840
Our host and curator, Beth Martin,
is getting engaged?

04:22.795 --> 04:25.855
Uh... Uh...

04:27.900 --> 04:30.630
No, I'm not. I'm not getting engaged!

04:30.670 --> 04:32.638
Not tonight, not to him.

04:39.545 --> 04:42.810
Oh, man.

04:42.849 --> 04:45.545
But maybe.
Maybe in the future sometime.

04:45.585 --> 04:48.918
I don't know. With someone else.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.856
Got to see how it pans out. OK?

05:05.471 --> 05:07.632
Well, at least it wasn't
in the Applebee's.

05:16.816 --> 05:18.716
Worst day ever.

05:30.797 --> 05:33.960
- Joan?
- Sis! Guess what?

05:34.000 --> 05:37.299
I'm getting married!

05:37.337 --> 05:39.532
Yay.

05:42.075 --> 05:46.774
His name is Umberto.
Umberto! How sexy is that?

05:46.813 --> 05:48.576
We met on a flight to Italy
two weeks ago,

05:48.614 --> 05:51.583
and now we're getting married. In Rome.

05:52.685 --> 05:56.678
Wow. That... Joan. Wow.

05:56.723 --> 06:00.250
He's the one, Beth. I know it.
I can't wait until you meet him.

06:00.293 --> 06:04.491
And when I do, I will have known him
for almost as long as you have.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.862
You know what?
You're not exactly a role model

06:06.899 --> 06:08.298
when it comes to relationships.

06:09.435 --> 06:12.097
OK, maybe not, but that is because

06:12.138 --> 06:14.698
I have a relationship with my job.

06:14.741 --> 06:18.700
I love my job. And when I find a guy
that I like more than my job,

06:18.745 --> 06:20.110
that's how I'll know he's the one.

06:20.146 --> 06:22.944
OK, so basically what you need
is a male version of yourself.

06:22.982 --> 06:24.973
Well, he doesn't have to be blonde.

06:26.452 --> 06:28.852
You know that I mean this
with all the love in the world,

06:28.888 --> 06:30.685
but two weeks, Joan?

06:30.723 --> 06:32.020
That's not long enough.

06:32.058 --> 06:33.958
That's not even enough time
for a credit check.

06:33.993 --> 06:37.622
When you know, you don't need proof.
You just know.

06:39.031 --> 06:43.593
- Be happy for me, B.
- God, I am! I am.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.637
I am.

06:46.672 --> 06:48.572
She's doomed. I mean, come on,

06:48.608 --> 06:51.168
you meet some Italian guy
in first class, you date him.

06:51.210 --> 06:53.804
- You don't marry him.
- She's so lucky.

06:53.846 --> 06:57.782
Just imagine working in a place
where they sort men into classes.

06:58.518 --> 06:59.985
What? I'm just saying.

07:00.019 --> 07:03.420
My baby sister is about to make
the biggest mistake of her life,

07:03.456 --> 07:05.424
and there's nothing I can do about it.

07:05.458 --> 07:07.653
She got swept away. It happens.

07:07.693 --> 07:09.183
No, it doesn't.

07:09.228 --> 07:11.025
Instead of chasing a fairy tale,

07:11.063 --> 07:13.691
you could focus on work.
That's what I do.

07:13.733 --> 07:16.463
And you know what?
I've never been happier.

07:17.770 --> 07:20.568
Well, you must be ecstatic.

07:20.606 --> 07:23.439
And still single, I understand.

07:26.579 --> 07:30.879
It appears we can begin.
In nine days, we'll be hosting

07:30.917 --> 07:32.976
the single most important event
of our year,

07:33.019 --> 07:36.750
The Board of Trustees'
Annual Circle of Gold Gala.

07:36.789 --> 07:39.019
This year, the special installation
for the event

07:39.058 --> 07:41.083
is the brainchild of our youngest

07:41.127 --> 07:44.790
and therefore least-experienced curator.

07:44.831 --> 07:50.463
An exhibition centered
on the theme of pain. Status report.

07:50.503 --> 07:52.528
Fourteen of our pieces
are already on site,

07:52.572 --> 07:54.506
and three of the remaining four
are en route.

07:54.540 --> 07:57.304
- And the remaining piece?
- Is the Slater Bradley.

07:57.343 --> 08:00.176
Yes, the centerpiece
for the exhibition, where is it?

08:00.213 --> 08:02.943
We're resolving some
last-minute insurance issues.

08:02.982 --> 08:05.678
Last-minute? I can't say
I like the sound of that.

08:05.718 --> 08:08.209
It'll be here. I'll make sure of it.

08:08.254 --> 08:09.778
Moving on...

08:09.822 --> 08:12.620
Ah, there is one small little detail.

08:12.658 --> 08:15.786
The day after tomorrow,
my sister will be getting married.

08:15.828 --> 08:18.922
In Rome. Italy.

08:25.004 --> 08:26.437
Well, that simply won't do.

08:27.907 --> 08:30.341
Well, it's my baby sister's wedding.

08:30.376 --> 08:32.537
Well, we all have sisters, Beth.

08:32.578 --> 08:33.840
Mmm.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.712
I will stay on top of this from Rome.

08:36.749 --> 08:39.946
I'll be in and out in 48 hours,
and you have my word, Celeste.

08:39.986 --> 08:42.352
The Circle of Gold Gala
will go off without a hitch.

08:42.388 --> 08:44.652
It better. You may be talented, Beth,

08:44.690 --> 08:47.181
but you're not irreplaceable.

08:47.226 --> 08:49.057
Have a nice trip.

08:50.296 --> 08:51.524
So...

09:01.874 --> 09:04.274
How long you stay Rome, eh?

09:04.310 --> 09:07.473
Uh, 48 hours and counting.

09:07.513 --> 09:10.073
Is not so much time. But lucky for you,

09:10.116 --> 09:12.846
it only takes a moment
to see true beauty.

09:14.020 --> 09:17.285
The Eternal City is
the most romantic city in the world.

09:17.323 --> 09:20.019
You never lived until you loved in Rome.

09:20.059 --> 09:22.118
Not a lot of reception around here, huh?

09:22.161 --> 09:26.427
<i>Put down your phone and look,
signora. Welcome to Roma!</i>

09:26.465 --> 09:29.866
Did I mention I'm late
for my sister's wedding?

09:29.902 --> 09:35.340
Many times.
So much beauty!

09:37.410 --> 09:41.210
And, finally,
the magnificent Fontana d'Amore.

09:45.818 --> 09:48.446
A place where romantics
from all over the world

09:48.487 --> 09:50.284
come to wish for love.

09:50.323 --> 09:53.486
Old people, young people, ugly people.

09:53.526 --> 09:55.926
They get so lost in love. It's nice!

09:55.962 --> 09:57.429
Yes, nice, thank you.

10:03.936 --> 10:06.461
And good luck!

10:08.874 --> 10:10.933
Joan,
the Amsale dress looks gorgeous.

10:10.977 --> 10:14.242
- Hi! Hi.
- Beth, darling!

10:14.280 --> 10:17.147
Wow, look at you.
You look exhausted.

10:17.183 --> 10:20.016
- Thanks, Mom.
- She looks fine.

10:20.052 --> 10:22.885
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

10:22.922 --> 10:25.755
What happened to "don't see the bride
before the wedding"?

10:25.791 --> 10:28.089
- Isn't this bad luck?
- Girls, we don't have time.

10:28.127 --> 10:31.255
Your father's current tramp of the month
is waiting inside with your dress.

10:31.297 --> 10:35.290
I heard that. And she's not a tramp.

10:35.334 --> 10:38.826
She's a pro beach volleyball player.
Hello, sweetheart.

10:38.871 --> 10:40.065
Hi, Daddy.

10:40.106 --> 10:41.869
- How are you?
- Exhausted.

10:41.907 --> 10:44.967
Beth, this is Umberto, my fiancé.

10:45.011 --> 10:47.002
So, you're my sister too, now.

10:50.683 --> 10:52.082
- Yeah.
- Come on.

10:52.118 --> 10:54.245
You have to meet his family.
They're a scream.

10:54.286 --> 10:55.446
See if he has a brother.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.853
- Dad!
- Cousin.

11:17.643 --> 11:19.235
Slippery little... Come on.

11:19.278 --> 11:21.371
How does he get service?

11:26.652 --> 11:28.483
- You're late, Nick.
- I'm sorry.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.284
- Where's your tie?
- Oh!

11:33.993 --> 11:35.517
There we go.

11:56.415 --> 11:58.383
I know, but I can't get
an Internet signal.

11:58.417 --> 12:01.909
I need to know that you're on top
of the Slater Bradley situation.

12:04.323 --> 12:05.347
Hey!

12:06.726 --> 12:09.490
You're breaking up.
Just whistle if you can hear me.

12:13.432 --> 12:16.265
- Stacy?
- Ah, there's my girl.

12:16.302 --> 12:17.462
Taking care of business.

12:17.503 --> 12:19.733
- Always.
- Having a good time?

12:19.772 --> 12:22.969
Oh, yeah. You know me,
I love small, intimate weddings.

12:23.008 --> 12:26.603
If you're gonna be a bear,
be a grizzly, right?

12:26.645 --> 12:28.078
I don't know what that means.

12:29.482 --> 12:33.543
- So, what do you think of Tina?
- She seems very fit, Dad.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.076
That's all you can say?

12:35.121 --> 12:39.683
Tan and odds-on favorite
to catch the bouquet.

12:39.725 --> 12:41.056
You're a very lucky man.

12:41.093 --> 12:45.120
I only wish for you the feeling I have
when I'm with her.

12:45.164 --> 12:48.725
Come on, Beth. Get going here.
I want to throw another wedding.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.737
You will. You're due
for another wife pretty soon.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.741
I'm sorry, that was a low blow.

12:55.775 --> 12:56.935
Quite a pair, huh?

12:56.976 --> 13:00.275
You refuse to fall in love,
and I can't stop.

13:00.312 --> 13:01.506
Promise me one thing.

13:01.547 --> 13:04.072
When it comes, you'll be open to it.

13:04.116 --> 13:07.017
- I will try, Daddy.
- There you are!

13:07.052 --> 13:09.179
- It's vase-breaking time.
- It's what?

13:09.221 --> 13:12.281
It's a tradition.
The maid of honor shatters a vase,

13:12.324 --> 13:14.087
and the number of pieces symbolizes

13:14.126 --> 13:16.185
the years of happiness
she wishes for the bride and groom.

13:16.228 --> 13:18.924
Wow! That's a lot of pressure.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.864
Right? So smash it hard.

13:20.900 --> 13:22.458
- OK.
- OK.

13:53.632 --> 13:55.224
I'm so sorry.

13:55.267 --> 13:59.226
I was not aiming for that,
but, man, I really nailed it.

14:05.244 --> 14:08.111
She wishes them a life

14:08.147 --> 14:11.139
- of great tragedy!
- No, I don't. No, I don't.

14:11.183 --> 14:13.549
I just... I'm trying to break it.
I'm really trying.

14:13.586 --> 14:16.282
I cracked it!

14:16.322 --> 14:18.290
OK. We're almost there. Excuse me.

14:23.762 --> 14:26.959
Die! Oh, man!

14:26.999 --> 14:29.263
Let's just go ahead
and let me handle this.

14:36.742 --> 14:39.575
Wow. You are... you're...

14:39.612 --> 14:42.046
You're quite the determined
little thing, aren't you?

14:42.081 --> 14:44.709
Yeah, well, I cracked it
before you smashed it.

14:44.750 --> 14:46.775
I know. Yeah, I know.

14:46.819 --> 14:48.286
- I'm Nick, by the way.
- Beth.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.311
Nice to meet you.
I would've introduced myself earlier,

14:50.356 --> 14:51.721
but I was running a little late.

14:51.757 --> 14:52.883
Yeah, I noticed.

14:52.925 --> 14:54.290
I was in the hills doing an interview,

14:54.326 --> 14:56.419
and on my way back
I kinda got hit by a goat.

14:56.462 --> 14:59.693
- Oh, my God! You hit a goat?
- No, the goat hit me.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.563
It wasn't my fault, and the goat's fine.

15:05.771 --> 15:07.671
- What are they saying?
- It means "speech."

15:07.706 --> 15:10.937
I think you're up again. There you go.

15:10.976 --> 15:13.570
Hello again.

15:13.612 --> 15:17.207
I'm Beth, sister of the bride.

15:17.249 --> 15:18.910
Umm...

15:22.721 --> 15:26.521
Umberto, though I haven't
known you for very long...

15:28.460 --> 15:30.087
Uh...

15:31.897 --> 15:34.559
I'm sorry. I don't speak any Italian.

15:34.867 --> 15:39.361
Umberto, although
I haven't known you very long...

15:44.109 --> 15:45.770
I'm a little rusty, so if you stay away

15:45.811 --> 15:47.506
from any obscure idioms,
that would be great.

15:47.546 --> 15:51.505
Yeah. Sure.
I'll keep it simple. Thank you.

15:51.550 --> 15:52.778
When I look at you, Joan,

15:52.818 --> 15:57.448
I remember a little girl
who believed in magic.

15:57.489 --> 15:59.650
As I look at you right now...

16:00.592 --> 16:01.991
...I see a grown woman

16:02.027 --> 16:06.691
who has seen all the magic in the world
come true tonight.

16:13.005 --> 16:14.302
Joan...

16:15.307 --> 16:17.605
Joan likes magic...

16:23.716 --> 16:25.183
This is harder than I thought.

16:26.151 --> 16:29.518
Maybe if we all clap loudly...

16:29.555 --> 16:31.614
...she'll wrap it up.

16:37.129 --> 16:40.895
Because you and Umberto
are making magic here tonight.

16:41.700 --> 16:44.828
Well, it was worth a try...

16:45.504 --> 16:49.440
And I know that, if you could,
you'd share that feeling with me.

16:50.142 --> 16:54.238
And I know that you'll...

16:54.279 --> 16:56.440
...share him with me.

16:56.482 --> 16:59.246
Oh!

17:07.893 --> 17:11.556
OK. It appears our best man
has run out of Italian,

17:11.597 --> 17:13.827
so cheers.

17:15.867 --> 17:18.701
I liked your toast.

17:18.737 --> 17:22.468
Thank you. Umberto's brother
already hit on me,

17:22.508 --> 17:25.534
and most of his family
thinks I'm a pervert, but thanks.

17:29.281 --> 17:31.249
They do that for good luck.

17:31.283 --> 17:35.276
So where did you learn
to speak Italian so poorly?

17:35.320 --> 17:38.721
Syracuse.
Umberto and I were roommates.

17:38.757 --> 17:42.193
He taught me
how to talk to girls in Italian,

17:42.227 --> 17:44.092
and I taught him American football.

17:45.964 --> 17:48.455
I wanted to ask you before...

17:49.535 --> 17:52.368
- Who is your service provider?
- Uh, why?

17:52.404 --> 17:55.464
I saw you e-mailing earlier,
and I kind of have signal envy.

17:55.507 --> 17:57.668
Give me your phone. I need
to send one quick work e-mail.

17:57.709 --> 17:59.643
- If I don't...
- No, you can't have my phone.

17:59.678 --> 18:01.942
- Why not?
- You're just gonna take my number.

18:01.980 --> 18:04.312
- I'm not gonna take your number.
- You're gonna take my phone

18:04.349 --> 18:06.112
and call your phone with it
so that you have my number,

18:06.151 --> 18:07.516
and I can't have you booty-calling me

18:07.553 --> 18:09.248
- at 2:30 in the morning.
- I'm not go...

18:09.288 --> 18:11.586
Wait! You know what? I do. I need it.

18:11.623 --> 18:13.716
Because I need to block it
from my phone.

18:13.759 --> 18:16.125
I can't give it to you, because
Umberto made me turn it off.

18:16.161 --> 18:17.628
- So it's on vibrate?
- No, it's off.

18:17.663 --> 18:20.757
- Like "off" off?
- Yeah.

18:20.799 --> 18:22.960
- Nicholas!
- Ah, Father Dino!

18:23.001 --> 18:24.992
- Nicholas!
- Father...

18:25.037 --> 18:26.334
All right.

18:26.371 --> 18:29.499
Maybe some cards again tonight?
Some Texas holding them?

18:29.541 --> 18:32.135
I don't think so. You cleaned me out
at Umberto's bachelor party.

18:32.177 --> 18:33.906
- No more cards for me, pal.
- Wow.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.176
I take my vows only six months ago.

18:36.215 --> 18:37.910
They say it's a work in the progress.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.282
- Sure.
- Forgive me.

18:40.319 --> 18:42.446
Come on, Father. It's OK.

18:42.488 --> 18:43.955
It's just a card game. It's OK.

18:43.989 --> 18:45.286
It's OK. No more cards.

18:45.324 --> 18:48.293
It's OK.

18:52.998 --> 18:55.626
- Look at those two.
- Tell me he's a good guy.

18:55.667 --> 18:58.568
- Ah, he's a saint. Her?
- An angel.

18:58.604 --> 19:01.869
Oh, a saint and an angel.
I give it a year.

19:01.907 --> 19:03.602
I would not even give it six months.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.940
This marriage has the shelf life
of a banana.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.172
They've known each other two weeks.

19:07.212 --> 19:09.612
That's not even enough time
for a credit check.

19:10.816 --> 19:14.513
- What?
- Nothing.

19:17.623 --> 19:19.488
Hey!

19:19.525 --> 19:21.322
No, wait! I don't want to... No, wait!

19:51.823 --> 19:54.485
Uh, it's my bad.

20:02.301 --> 20:03.700
Sorry about that.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.696
Go ahead.

20:13.845 --> 20:14.937
What are you...?

20:16.882 --> 20:19.043
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, yeah. It's mine.

20:19.084 --> 20:21.109
Just put that back in there. Thank you.

20:34.366 --> 20:36.891
Hey!

20:36.935 --> 20:38.334
Hey.

20:40.405 --> 20:42.464
- What did he just yell at you?
- Nothing.

20:42.507 --> 20:43.735
- What?
- Nothing.

20:44.810 --> 20:47.005
It means "the hit."

20:47.045 --> 20:49.673
I played some football in college and...

20:51.650 --> 20:55.609
...I took kind of a big hit.

20:55.654 --> 20:59.613
Football. Goats. You get hit a lot.

20:59.658 --> 21:01.319
It's kind of a famous hit.

21:01.360 --> 21:04.352
It's not exactly what you want
to be known for.

21:04.396 --> 21:07.126
But it's football. Doesn't everyone
get hit in football?

21:07.165 --> 21:10.726
I got hit by lightning. OK?

21:10.769 --> 21:12.327
On the field. In a game.

21:14.740 --> 21:16.139
- Oh...
- Yeah.

21:16.174 --> 21:17.641
See, I get that look a lot.

21:18.977 --> 21:21.844
It's OK. It's OK.

21:21.880 --> 21:25.213
Aside from a slight
peripheral vision issue, I'm fine.

21:25.250 --> 21:29.050
- Oh! Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

21:32.157 --> 21:33.715
You smell like lavender.

21:36.628 --> 21:38.562
You smell like livestock.

21:41.266 --> 21:43.257
You're not so tough.

21:51.176 --> 21:53.770
Beth! It's time to cut the cake.

21:53.812 --> 21:58.806
Oh... all right.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.379
He looks nice.

22:03.422 --> 22:05.151
But so did your father.

22:19.071 --> 22:21.232
- You seen her?
- No.

22:26.111 --> 22:27.339
Be open to it, Beth.

22:28.747 --> 22:30.339
Trust in love, Beth.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.079
Believe in magic, Beth.

22:34.619 --> 22:36.348
Mmm-hmm.

22:36.388 --> 22:37.514
What the hell.

23:05.617 --> 23:08.916
Come on. There you go.

23:08.954 --> 23:10.114
OK...

23:13.458 --> 23:14.982
Of course.

23:32.043 --> 23:35.240
What an idiot.

24:06.545 --> 24:10.743
What are you looking at?
Fountain of Love.

24:12.284 --> 24:16.983
What a crock.
I mean, we wait our whole lives

24:17.022 --> 24:22.358
for some perfect guy to come in
and sweep us off our feet.

24:22.394 --> 24:25.420
Well, guess what. He's not coming.

24:46.852 --> 24:50.982
Each one of you
is a desperate wish for love

24:51.022 --> 24:53.786
that is never gonna come true.

25:06.338 --> 25:09.239
So I'm saving you.

25:17.315 --> 25:19.283
And...

25:22.320 --> 25:26.757
...saving you.

25:30.862 --> 25:33.194
You, I don't give a damn about.

25:37.068 --> 25:38.865
But I am saving you.

25:42.774 --> 25:44.207
Magic.

25:47.112 --> 25:50.240
- And you...
- So beautiful.

25:50.282 --> 25:51.909
Thank you.

26:03.295 --> 26:05.422
And I'm saving you.

26:09.801 --> 26:11.860
- Hey, Father Dino.
- Nicholas.

26:26.985 --> 26:30.011
Oop, the love police.

27:02.654 --> 27:06.249
- Hello.
- Oh, hey. Hey, it's Nick.

27:06.291 --> 27:07.952
<i>Nick who?</i>

27:07.993 --> 27:10.427
- Beamon. From the wedding.
- What's taking him so long?

27:10.462 --> 27:12.987
<i>- Joan gave me your number.
- Of course she did.</i>

27:13.031 --> 27:14.965
Uh, I wasn't really
expecting to get you.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.093
Want me to hang up
so you can talk to the machine?

27:17.135 --> 27:20.263
- No. This is good.
- Yo, Nick! What's going on?

27:20.305 --> 27:22.739
Did you get lost?
Grab some beers! Let's do this!

27:22.774 --> 27:24.264
I'm looking for the bottle opener.

27:24.309 --> 27:26.504
It's on the fridge. See it from here.

27:26.544 --> 27:28.307
Dude, you gave me the instruction card.

27:28.346 --> 27:30.109
- That's a helpful card.
- Why is it wet?

27:30.148 --> 27:32.173
- I put it in a glass of water.
- Why would you do that?

27:32.217 --> 27:34.344
- I don't know.
- That's weird.

27:34.386 --> 27:36.354
I was thinking maybe
we could have dinner later?

27:36.388 --> 27:38.379
Uh, I'm already having dinner.

27:38.423 --> 27:41.790
<i>Oh. Maybe a drink? Some coffee?</i>

27:41.826 --> 27:44.818
<i>- Nope.
- Which part no?</i>

27:44.863 --> 27:46.728
- The drink or the coffee?
- Nick!

27:46.765 --> 27:49.529
Umm, it's just sort of a blanket nope.

27:49.567 --> 27:50.932
Nick, how long you gonna take?

27:50.969 --> 27:53.096
<i>We watched Roots while you were gone!</i>

27:53.138 --> 27:55.265
Maybe I'm a little off base here,

27:55.306 --> 27:57.433
<i>but I thought that we hit it off
the other night, no?</i>

27:57.475 --> 27:59.568
Yeah, Nick, you're a little off base.

28:02.681 --> 28:06.310
Who would win in a fight?
A whale or a silverback gorilla?

28:06.351 --> 28:07.409
Definitely a whale.

28:07.452 --> 28:09.386
It also depends
if they're in water or not.

28:09.421 --> 28:11.446
What about, like,
a couple silverback gorillas?

28:11.489 --> 28:12.979
If they're in water, they'll lose.

28:13.024 --> 28:14.855
Don't think they swim good?

28:14.893 --> 28:16.884
I think they swim well.
I don't know if they swim good.

28:16.928 --> 28:18.862
Let's be an English major,
why don't we?

28:18.897 --> 28:20.057
Dude, what took you so long?

28:20.098 --> 28:22.225
I didn't have a beard
when you left.

28:22.267 --> 28:23.996
Nice. What's this?

28:24.035 --> 28:26.026
- What's it look like?
- A bottle opener.

28:26.071 --> 28:29.063
Use that to open beer bottles?
That would've been nice, beers.

28:29.107 --> 28:31.575
That would've been nice.
That would've been great.

28:31.609 --> 28:33.736
Whoa! You didn't call some chick

28:33.778 --> 28:35.439
- during our game, did you?
- No!

28:35.480 --> 28:38.005
You don't mind if I hit redial?
That wouldn't bother you?

28:38.049 --> 28:40.950
- No, no, no, no. Give me that!
- Hello? I love you.

28:40.985 --> 28:43.613
- So touchy all of a sudden.
- I'm not touchy.

28:43.655 --> 28:44.883
You're sensitive all of a sudden.

28:44.923 --> 28:48.086
I'm not... I'm not sensitive.

28:48.126 --> 28:50.253
That's what a sensitive person
would say.

28:50.295 --> 28:51.819
Yeah, whatever.

28:51.863 --> 28:56.061
Methinks some girl
has put a spell on you.

29:36.007 --> 29:39.499
No!

29:41.045 --> 29:44.913
Wait! I just need to see your feet!

29:44.949 --> 29:47.509
OK, I chase. No problem.

29:47.552 --> 29:49.679
This is a great view from behind.

29:49.721 --> 29:51.689
Wait!

29:51.723 --> 29:54.954
Now the game is on!

29:54.993 --> 29:58.360
<i>In Italia, when a woman run away,
it mean she love you!</i>

29:58.396 --> 30:03.595
<i>You must love me so much!
Bella, wait! Wait!</i>

30:03.635 --> 30:06.627
How can I prove my love to you,
if you won't stop?!

30:06.671 --> 30:10.163
<i>Mi amore, I just need
one moment with your feet!</i>

30:11.843 --> 30:12.901
I'm coming!

30:15.046 --> 30:16.843
Uh-oh!

30:18.249 --> 30:19.511
You out of your frigging mind, dude?

30:19.551 --> 30:21.678
Are you OK?

30:22.887 --> 30:24.821
I don't know what you're saying.
What's he saying?

30:24.856 --> 30:26.653
I don't know. I don't speak idiot.

30:28.159 --> 30:29.956
Please, allow me...

30:29.994 --> 30:35.728
<i>...to see your magnifico feet.
- What? No! Ew!</i>

30:36.835 --> 30:37.927
Hey, this is you.

30:37.969 --> 30:41.336
- And this one, too.
- Let me explain.

30:41.372 --> 30:43.966
My name is Antonio Guiseppe Donatello.

30:44.008 --> 30:46.533
<i>I'm from the village of Nunzio
in Italia.</i>

30:46.578 --> 30:50.810
I... Oh, my spleen. It's OK.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.976
Two days ago, I have a vision.

30:53.017 --> 30:56.680
I see the face of love, your face.

30:56.721 --> 30:59.747
Then I see your neck,
your torso, your...

30:59.791 --> 31:01.258
Oh, got it. I get it.

31:01.292 --> 31:05.422
But... I could not paint your feet.

31:05.463 --> 31:07.658
You came from Italy to paint my feet?

31:07.699 --> 31:11.499
No, also to earn your love.

31:11.536 --> 31:13.902
I think you have me confused
with someone else.

31:13.938 --> 31:16.202
Put some ice on it and be careful.

31:16.241 --> 31:20.405
OK! I will paint your face
on every building in this city

31:20.445 --> 31:23.972
until you recognize my love!

31:27.285 --> 31:29.685
Hi. I'm kind of in a hurry, so...
Thanks.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.211
No problem.

31:31.256 --> 31:33.451
Isn't this place the greatest?

31:33.491 --> 31:36.358
You can get your work done,
no one bothers you.

31:36.394 --> 31:39.795
Food's great. Low carb, high protein.

31:39.831 --> 31:42.231
The only way to go when
your work requires you to be

31:42.267 --> 31:44.098
shredded and dieseled out.

31:45.737 --> 31:47.864
Oh, yeah, here, don't crane your neck.

31:47.906 --> 31:52.240
Go ahead. Feast your eyes.
Yes, I've seen that look before.

31:52.277 --> 31:54.802
You're intimidated
because I'm a model.

31:54.846 --> 31:58.304
But I don't want you to be scared,
OK? I'm a normal guy.

31:58.349 --> 32:01.079
This is my portfolio.
It's kind of my calling card.

32:01.119 --> 32:04.646
These are mostly non-paying jobs,
or spec work.

32:04.689 --> 32:06.213
I think that's a real dog.

32:06.257 --> 32:12.093
And here's the crown jewel.
I am the Gasee guy. So...

32:12.130 --> 32:14.997
- Wow.
- I'm Gale.

32:15.033 --> 32:16.432
Like a gale-force wind.

32:16.467 --> 32:18.264
I took on that name because

32:18.303 --> 32:20.794
it's the most powerful force
in the natural world.

32:20.838 --> 32:23.170
For shaping and
eroding the earth, it's...

32:23.207 --> 32:24.572
You can feel it.

32:24.609 --> 32:27.009
Actually, I think that's water,
eroding the earth.

32:27.045 --> 32:28.740
Don't think it's water.
I think it's wind.

32:28.780 --> 32:31.772
- Like the Grand Canyon.
- I'm gonna look that up.

32:32.817 --> 32:34.580
This is crazy. I don't know

32:34.619 --> 32:36.086
whether to look at
my own reflection or at you,

32:36.120 --> 32:39.578
- that's how beautiful you are.
- You know what? I have to go.

32:39.624 --> 32:42.957
OK, you asked for it.

32:42.994 --> 32:46.589
- Yeah, she's back. Hi.
- You can't just take your shirt off.

32:46.631 --> 32:50.431
I don't hear any complaints
from the peanut gallery, so...

32:50.468 --> 32:53.062
- Put your shirt back on, creep.
- Here you go.

32:55.440 --> 32:57.203
I know this looks nuts, all right?

32:57.241 --> 32:59.402
And maybe I am a little nuts
because I've never

32:59.444 --> 33:01.605
tried to share my beauty
with anyone before.

33:01.646 --> 33:05.241
And I think it's because
I'm in love with you. Big time.

33:06.117 --> 33:08.415
Great first date, Beth!

33:08.453 --> 33:10.978
Let's get another one on the books soon.

33:11.022 --> 33:13.047
Come on, man, put your shirt on.

33:13.091 --> 33:14.581
Honestly though,
is there a doctor here,

33:14.625 --> 33:17.617
because there's some kind
of weird swelling in this...

33:17.662 --> 33:20.187
Yeah, that can't be normal, can it?
Humans aren't...

33:20.231 --> 33:22.461
Jeez, Louise, dessert's served.

33:22.500 --> 33:23.967
Sit down, Gas guy.

33:35.713 --> 33:38.841
- Oh, sorry.
- Excuse me, miss. Miss?

33:38.883 --> 33:40.407
I believe you dropped this.

33:42.320 --> 33:45.414
Oh, my... Yeah, thank you.

33:45.456 --> 33:47.822
I don't know how that fell off. Thanks.

33:48.559 --> 33:49.719
Miss?

33:55.166 --> 33:56.258
How did you...?

33:56.300 --> 33:59.269
Time flies, but magic flies faster.

33:59.303 --> 34:02.534
Oh, you're a street magician.

34:02.573 --> 34:05.565
I really appreciate it,
but I don't have the time right now.

34:05.610 --> 34:09.011
You have all the time in the world.

34:09.047 --> 34:12.312
Damn it. All right,
now it's getting kind of creepy

34:12.350 --> 34:15.911
because you must have just
touched me, and I didn't feel anything.

34:15.953 --> 34:19.252
Pick a card, and I'll show you my heart.

34:19.290 --> 34:21.952
- Come on, do it!
- Do it!

34:21.993 --> 34:25.053
If I pick a card,
will you stop stealing my watch?

34:25.096 --> 34:27.121
- Probably.
- OK.

34:28.232 --> 34:30.427
Take a good look.
Don't show it to me.

34:30.467 --> 34:32.527
- Wasn't gonna.
- Place it back in the deck.

34:32.570 --> 34:35.130
- Ready, everyone?
- Wow.

34:45.248 --> 34:46.273
That's not my card.

34:46.317 --> 34:50.253
I know... because the joker is me.

34:50.288 --> 34:54.384
A fool for love.
I told you I'd show you my heart.

34:58.696 --> 35:00.425
Ew!

35:00.465 --> 35:02.057
Oh!

35:02.100 --> 35:03.362
Is this your card?

35:05.470 --> 35:08.303
Get over here.
Little help here, please.

35:10.041 --> 35:12.532
Hey, little girl, could you please
give me my heart?

35:19.217 --> 35:21.185
Is it me, or is New York
getting crazier?

35:21.219 --> 35:23.278
- Your sister's on line two.
- Take a message.

35:23.321 --> 35:26.950
- She says it's kind of important.
- Fine. Patch her through.

35:26.991 --> 35:28.686
Hi, Joan.

35:28.726 --> 35:30.751
What were you doing
in the Fontana d'Amore

35:30.795 --> 35:33.389
<i>- during my wedding?
- What makes you think that...</i>

35:33.431 --> 35:35.558
I'm looking at a picture of you.

35:35.600 --> 35:38.330
It's front-page news over here, sis.
What were you thinking?

35:38.369 --> 35:40.997
<i>I don't know.
Little bit ofjet lag,</i>

35:41.038 --> 35:43.802
little bit of champagne,
or a lot of champagne.

35:43.841 --> 35:46.139
And the next thing I'm sitting
in the fountain picking up coins.

35:46.177 --> 35:49.305
<i>She took coins from the fontana?
That's not so good.</i>

35:49.347 --> 35:51.440
<i>- Why not so good?
- There is a legend,</i>

35:51.482 --> 35:53.541
<i>if you take someone's coin
from the fontana,</i>

35:53.584 --> 35:55.017
<i>they will fall in love with you.</i>

35:55.052 --> 35:59.079
- Oh! Except that is ridiculous.
- OK. Then we hang up!

36:01.526 --> 36:03.585
<i>I totally believe
in magic coins.</i>

36:05.363 --> 36:09.356
- Were you on that call?
- Love is finally at your doorstep.

36:09.400 --> 36:12.130
So have any men come on to you
since the wedding?

36:12.170 --> 36:14.297
- Well...
- Oh, my God. They have been.

36:14.338 --> 36:17.068
Yeah, a couple of weirdos
approached me this morning...

36:17.108 --> 36:19.372
There are some magical forces
at work here.

36:19.410 --> 36:21.935
I don't believe in magic.
Know what I do believe in?

36:21.979 --> 36:23.879
Art. Where's my Slater Bradley?

36:23.915 --> 36:25.382
Told you I was on top of it.

36:25.416 --> 36:27.884
The insurance company
totally wanted to jack up the rate,

36:27.919 --> 36:32.788
so in an effort to be more assertive,
I told them to shove it.

36:32.823 --> 36:35.257
You told Hillman and Craft to shove it?

36:35.293 --> 36:36.851
- Yeah.
- That piece was coming

36:36.894 --> 36:38.259
from a collector in Australia.

36:38.296 --> 36:39.593
Even if we got it on a jet today,

36:39.630 --> 36:41.723
it would never clear customs
in time for the gala.

36:41.766 --> 36:44.291
That means I have no centerpiece
for the Circle of Gold.

36:44.335 --> 36:46.200
I'll get Hillman and Craft on the phone.

36:46.237 --> 36:49.570
- I don't think I burned that bridge.
- No, no. It's too late now.

36:51.375 --> 36:54.538
I have to tell Celeste.

36:54.579 --> 36:58.071
Hello?

36:58.115 --> 37:00.879
Hey. Did I mention Joan
gave me your cell number, too?

37:00.918 --> 37:04.183
- Little busy now. What do you want?
- Same thing I wanted last night.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.622
What is it going to take for me
to convince you

37:06.657 --> 37:09.626
<i>- that I'm not interested in you?
- What is it going to take?</i>

37:09.660 --> 37:12.288
It's going to take you looking me
in the eye to tell me that.

37:12.330 --> 37:14.389
That'd require seeing you,
and I don't have the time...

37:14.432 --> 37:18.391
- Hi.
- Oh, so you're stalking me now?

37:18.436 --> 37:21.564
No, I'm just running into you
in a premeditated manner.

37:21.606 --> 37:23.733
I have a big problem
on my hands right now.

37:23.774 --> 37:25.639
I just lost the centerpiece to my show.

37:25.676 --> 37:28.076
- Beth?
- Celeste.

37:28.112 --> 37:30.706
This is Mr. Al Russo, our newest patron.

37:30.748 --> 37:32.579
He asked specifically to see you.

37:32.617 --> 37:36.553
Of course. Um, hi. Um...

37:36.587 --> 37:40.023
- I'm sorry. Have we met before?
- In my dreams.

37:44.028 --> 37:48.158
Beth has secured a rare Slater Bradley
as the centerpiece for our pain exhibit.

37:48.199 --> 37:49.723
Actually, Celeste...

37:49.767 --> 37:53.168
- Nick Beamon? Are you Nick Beamon?
- Yeah.

37:53.204 --> 37:57.641
Nick the Hit! You want to talk
about pain, this guy...

38:00.278 --> 38:03.907
- A million volts in the neck.
- That's fascinating.

38:03.948 --> 38:06.815
Beth, you do have
the Slater Bradley, yes?

38:06.851 --> 38:09.376
- Celeste, it's...
- My fault,

38:09.420 --> 38:10.546
and I was meaning to tell you...

38:10.588 --> 38:12.818
Actually, she has access
to something better.

38:12.857 --> 38:15.917
- This is really not the time.
- An original Petrocelli.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.655
<i>The title of the photograph is Anguish.</i>

38:17.695 --> 38:19.322
It too has never been viewed in public.

38:19.363 --> 38:22.025
A Petrocelli that's never been viewed?

38:22.066 --> 38:25.126
That's right. Damian Petrocelli
agreed to give me the print

38:25.169 --> 38:27.399
- and burn the negative.
- Why would he do that?

38:27.438 --> 38:30.339
Because I happen to be
the subject of the photo.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.834
And I'm willing to relive
that humiliation in public

38:33.878 --> 38:35.869
because I know that
as long as Beth is involved,

38:35.913 --> 38:37.710
it will be in good hands.

38:41.852 --> 38:44.184
How about that private tour
we're gonna have?

38:44.221 --> 38:46.883
Follow me.

38:46.924 --> 38:49.085
...including Cézanne, Degas,

38:49.126 --> 38:52.493
Manet, Picasso and Van Gogh...

38:52.530 --> 38:55.021
They're just really nicely spaced.

38:55.066 --> 38:57.864
You did such a great job.

38:57.902 --> 39:01.394
Let me... I have something for you.
This is a gift for you.

39:02.673 --> 39:04.300
Oh, my.

39:05.843 --> 39:07.105
It's not from Tiffany.

39:10.881 --> 39:15.318
- Sausage. That's your face.
- Yeah, that's it.

39:15.353 --> 39:18.345
This may sound a little odd to you,

39:18.389 --> 39:21.415
but encased meat is my life's work.

39:21.459 --> 39:25.691
I am like a curator, just like you.
A curator of sausage.

39:25.730 --> 39:29.325
- Well, passion is passion.
- That's exactly what I say.

39:29.367 --> 39:32.530
There is not an emotion on Earth

39:32.570 --> 39:36.062
that can't be expressed
through sausage.

39:36.107 --> 39:39.838
And that bratwurst is saying,

39:39.877 --> 39:44.075
"Hello, and thank you
for showing me the museum."

39:44.115 --> 39:46.913
Who knew bratwurst
could even say all that?

39:48.719 --> 39:50.277
- Beth.
- Please tell me you're here

39:50.321 --> 39:52.687
because you have
a deep appreciation for modern art.

39:52.723 --> 39:56.250
I have a deep appreciation,
but for you, Beth.

39:56.293 --> 39:57.988
That's it. Tour's over.

39:58.028 --> 40:01.293
I know it seems crazy.
It's crazy to me too.

40:02.900 --> 40:04.925
Want to play cat and mouse?
I can play cat and mouse.

40:08.839 --> 40:11.603
You forgot your sausages!

40:43.674 --> 40:45.642
Oh, no. Oh, no.

40:45.676 --> 40:47.906
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, it hurts.

40:47.945 --> 40:50.675
I'm so sorry. I didn't know
that was you. I didn't...

40:50.714 --> 40:52.909
I'm really sorry.

40:52.950 --> 40:54.850
It hurts so bad, but tastes so good.

40:54.885 --> 40:57.012
- What is that, mint?
- It's breath spray.

40:57.054 --> 40:59.921
You startled me, I didn't have
anything else. I am so sorry.

40:59.957 --> 41:01.652
Can I see it? Take your hands away.

41:01.692 --> 41:03.683
- You're gonna make it worse.
- I'm not gonna make it worse.

41:03.727 --> 41:06.491
Don't be such a baby.
I really feel awful.

41:06.530 --> 41:08.691
I did not know
that it would hurt that bad.

41:10.334 --> 41:14.168
It doesn't hurt that bad.
I was just playing.

41:15.639 --> 41:17.129
You think you're real charming,
don't you?

41:17.174 --> 41:21.110
- Little bit.
- Yeah. Well, you are. OK?

41:21.145 --> 41:22.476
- What?
- OK.

41:22.513 --> 41:23.878
Where are you going?

41:23.914 --> 41:25.848
I know your type of guy, Nick.

41:25.883 --> 41:27.680
And what type is that?

41:27.718 --> 41:31.085
Come on. The girl in the red dress
kissing you at the fountain?

41:31.922 --> 41:33.287
- You saw that?
- Yeah.

41:33.324 --> 41:35.849
That's why you've been cold
the last couple of days.

41:35.893 --> 41:37.292
Is that so hard to believe?

41:37.328 --> 41:39.421
That was Umberto's crazy cousin, OK?

41:39.463 --> 41:41.488
You know the blood runs hot
in that family.

41:41.532 --> 41:43.397
Yeah, you seemed so sick about it.

41:43.434 --> 41:46.198
I was a little sick about it.
Especially after I met you.

41:48.405 --> 41:50.566
Wait!

41:50.608 --> 41:53.907
Oh, no. Let's go this way.

41:53.944 --> 41:58.108
- Hey, Beth! It's me, Al Russo!
- Oh, let's cross.

41:59.283 --> 42:01.979
Whoa! Wait one second.

42:03.687 --> 42:05.314
- One second!
- I'm sorry, Nick! I gotta go!

42:05.356 --> 42:07.551
- Just...
- I'm sorry. I gotta go.

42:07.591 --> 42:10.389
Hold on! Beth! Beth, wait.

42:15.766 --> 42:17.131
Ah!

42:21.372 --> 42:24.034
Ah, I did not
see that one coming!

42:25.509 --> 42:29.001
OK, Lance, you can do this.
Just have to believe.

42:29.046 --> 42:33.039
I will do the Great Mummy Escape,
and Beth will love me.

42:33.083 --> 42:35.551
This worked for Houdini,
it should work for me.

42:35.586 --> 42:38.111
OK, here she comes.

42:38.155 --> 42:43.388
Well, I don't know, Joan. OK?
I don't know what I believe anymore.

42:43.427 --> 42:47.261
All I know is that this is crazy,
and I need it to stop.

42:47.298 --> 42:48.993
We told you this would happen.

42:49.033 --> 42:53.527
OK, then what is it gonna take
for me to end this little nightmare?

42:53.571 --> 42:56.267
You have to return the coins
to the Fontana d'Amore.

42:56.307 --> 42:58.298
Wait, that's it?

42:58.342 --> 43:00.367
And spell broken,
and these guys leave me alone?

43:00.411 --> 43:02.379
I'm overnighting you
the coins right now.

43:02.413 --> 43:05.314
That's no good. She needs
to return the coins herself.

43:05.349 --> 43:09.752
I cannot just fly back to Italy to put
some magic coins into a fountain.

43:09.787 --> 43:12.119
<i>There's got to be another way
we can handle this.</i>

43:12.156 --> 43:14.386
- Try and enjoy the attention?
- Joan...

43:15.960 --> 43:19.418
Beth! It's me, Lance.

43:19.463 --> 43:21.829
I'm setting a record for you.

43:21.865 --> 43:23.457
I know this looks scary and dangerous,

43:23.500 --> 43:25.968
but if I can do this,
get out of the straitjacket...

43:26.003 --> 43:27.766
Stop! Stop!

43:32.509 --> 43:35.774
What are you doing in my apartment?

43:35.813 --> 43:38.407
Blowing your mind!

43:38.449 --> 43:41.976
No one's ever done the Mummy Escape
in under three minutes.

43:42.019 --> 43:46.183
- Juan, what's my time?
- Three minutes and 53 seconds.

43:46.223 --> 43:47.986
I don't know. That felt pretty tight.

43:48.025 --> 43:49.754
Are you sure you timed that right?

43:49.793 --> 43:54.821
You know, you want to find the rabbit,
you got to work the hat.

43:54.865 --> 43:56.662
You're just not putting in
the hours, bro.

43:56.700 --> 43:59.134
- Not in front of my girlfriend.
- Who the hell is that?

43:59.169 --> 44:00.602
That's Juan, my assistant.

44:00.638 --> 44:03.698
He's just been video chronicling
all my illusions. Anyway...

44:03.741 --> 44:05.766
Both of you, out of my apartment, now.

44:05.809 --> 44:07.538
No, wait. Now listen up.

44:07.578 --> 44:09.671
Oh, my goodness.
Your perfume is intoxicating,

44:09.713 --> 44:12.477
and your hair smells like cinnamon!

44:19.156 --> 44:20.646
Get out!

44:21.992 --> 44:24.552
Hey, Nick... Douche.

44:26.196 --> 44:28.096
You get those old Giant photos
I asked you for?

44:28.132 --> 44:30.157
I am a professional photographer.

44:30.200 --> 44:31.929
I'm not your girl Friday, OK?

44:31.969 --> 44:34.665
I would appreciate some respect,
but yes, here.

44:34.705 --> 44:39.165
Or, in lieu of respect, I'd appreciate
you and me chatting up two ladies

44:39.209 --> 44:43.339
and leaving the one that knows more
about Wookiees alone with this.

44:43.380 --> 44:45.041
I'm not gonna be able
to make that party.

44:45.082 --> 44:47.915
What? No, Saturday night
is the ESPN party.

44:47.951 --> 44:52.684
That's a work and play event, dude.
Oh, my God. It's the girl.

44:52.723 --> 44:55.658
- The museum girl, isn't it? I knew it.
- You don't understand.

44:55.693 --> 44:57.752
You should see this girl.
I can barely keep up with her.

44:57.795 --> 44:58.819
She's smart.

44:58.862 --> 45:01.422
She's beautiful. She's funny.

45:01.465 --> 45:04.730
Oh, my God, no.
Stop it! Stop liking her!

45:04.768 --> 45:07.760
Do not go any further until I can do
a little recon on this girl.

45:07.805 --> 45:10.433
Recon? What are you, black ops?
No, absolutely not.

45:10.474 --> 45:12.237
What do you really know about her?

45:12.276 --> 45:13.903
I'm not going to let my boy
go in there blind.

45:13.944 --> 45:15.844
- Puck! No!
- No?

45:15.879 --> 45:16.937
- No!
- No?

45:16.980 --> 45:18.242
- No.
- How about yes?

45:18.282 --> 45:20.273
OK, go.

45:27.191 --> 45:29.682
Hey! Look at you!

45:29.727 --> 45:31.718
Look at me, we look great!

45:31.762 --> 45:34.560
I can't jog. I have a weak hamstring.

45:44.141 --> 45:47.907
It's OK. I nearly die. But I...

45:50.013 --> 45:54.074
Robert Longo,
Kiki Smith, Carl Riddle...

46:21.812 --> 46:25.407
Mm-hm.

46:36.994 --> 46:40.259
Wow! That looks great!

46:40.297 --> 46:42.959
Let's be beautiful together.
Where you going? Beth!

46:43.000 --> 46:44.627
It's gonna come back around
in four minutes.

46:44.668 --> 46:46.898
It's gonna be great!

46:49.506 --> 46:50.871
I can explain.

46:50.908 --> 46:54.469
There's a nude mural of you
on 82nd Street. Should we start there?

46:55.813 --> 47:00.375
I know. That is actually a funny...

47:01.652 --> 47:04.780
- Could we start somewhere else?
- Flowers everywhere!

47:04.822 --> 47:09.282
A sudden, unexplained change in
the program for the Circle of Gold gala.

47:09.326 --> 47:11.851
I need to have confidence
in my curators, Beth...

47:11.895 --> 47:13.658
You wouldn't believe if...

47:16.800 --> 47:18.995
You're right.

47:19.036 --> 47:21.527
- I'm sorry.
- You promised me this program

47:21.572 --> 47:24.097
- would go off without a hitch.
- It will.

47:25.576 --> 47:29.205
Let me be perfectly clear.
If it doesn't, I'll see to it

47:29.246 --> 47:31.407
that the only artwork
you're ever allowed near

47:31.448 --> 47:34.144
are the velvet Elvis paintings
for sale in Times Square.

47:34.184 --> 47:36.243
- Got it?
- Yeah.

47:36.286 --> 47:40.848
This is gonna be
a serious blow to your self-esteem.

47:40.891 --> 47:42.518
Maybe you should sit down.

47:42.559 --> 47:45.494
Remember that girl? The one
you wanted to settle down with?

47:45.529 --> 47:47.497
The one you wanted to be
little soccer dad with?

47:47.531 --> 47:50.694
Well, guess what. Mama's
a bigger player than you, son!

47:50.734 --> 47:52.895
Shazam! Check it out.

47:52.936 --> 47:57.066
Foreign guys, old dudes,
Houdini, a half-naked gentleman.

47:57.107 --> 47:59.268
This girl sees more action
in one afternoon

47:59.309 --> 48:02.107
than you saw
in your whole senior season.

48:02.145 --> 48:06.741
Look, I'm sorry, man,
but it's all there.

48:06.783 --> 48:08.978
It's pretty clear what I have to do.

48:10.854 --> 48:11.980
Yeah.

48:16.693 --> 48:18.092
I got to pick up my game.

48:18.128 --> 48:19.425
Ow!

48:25.836 --> 48:29.135
- I was just thinking about you.
- I was just thinking of you.

48:29.172 --> 48:31.572
I'm sorry I ran off the other day.

48:31.608 --> 48:34.202
I've just been having
one of those weeks.

48:34.244 --> 48:37.304
Yeah, so it would seem.
Is everything OK?

48:37.347 --> 48:39.440
There's a lot I would like to tell you.

48:39.483 --> 48:42.452
Unfortunately, I need to cut
to the chase. Back her up a bit.

48:42.486 --> 48:46.115
My fundraiser at the museum,
it's tomorrow,

48:46.156 --> 48:48.920
<i>- and I need to get my hands on that...
- The Petrocelli.</i>

48:48.959 --> 48:51.325
I'm kind of wavering on that now.

48:51.361 --> 48:54.228
But that's the centerpiece
to my pain exhibit.

48:54.264 --> 48:57.131
Yeah, but have you thought at all
about my pain, my suffering?

48:57.167 --> 48:59.328
<i>- What?
- I would feel better about it</i>

48:59.369 --> 49:01.963
if we could sit down, talk about it,
maybe over dinner?

49:02.005 --> 49:03.734
I know this place
called Blackout on Bleecker.

49:03.774 --> 49:06.607
<i>- I was thinking 8:00?
- So you're blackmailing me now?</i>

49:06.643 --> 49:09.237
- Actually, it's extortion.
- If I come to dinner,

49:09.279 --> 49:12.373
- can I have my Petrocelli?
- I got to run. See you at 8:00!

49:17.254 --> 49:19.381
- You have a date, huh?
- It's not a date.

49:21.558 --> 49:23.321
So, what are you gonna wear?

49:23.360 --> 49:26.852
My navy blouse, a pencil skirt,
and some open-toed slingbacks.

49:35.372 --> 49:37.340
- Hey.
- Hey.

49:37.374 --> 49:38.898
Wow. You look great.

49:38.942 --> 49:42.139
Oh, I didn't really have time
to get ready. Um...

49:42.179 --> 49:44.374
So this is it?

49:44.414 --> 49:47.315
Yeah. It's supposed to get
a lot better in the back.

49:47.351 --> 49:50.980
- OK.
- Look, we got off on the wrong foot.

49:51.021 --> 49:52.886
Actually, we got off on the right foot,

49:52.923 --> 49:55.153
and Umberto's cousin
messed everything...

49:55.192 --> 49:57.285
I don't even want to talk about that
right now.

49:57.327 --> 50:00.125
I just wanted to tell you
ever since that night in Rome...

50:00.163 --> 50:02.097
Hi! My name is llona,

50:02.132 --> 50:06.125
and I'll be your sensory guide
this evening.

50:06.169 --> 50:10.731
Tonight you will enjoy
a delicious gourmet meal

50:10.774 --> 50:13.834
without your primary sense of sight.

50:13.877 --> 50:18.075
In this way your other senses
will become heightened

50:18.115 --> 50:20.982
to bring you an exciting,
new culinary experience.

50:21.018 --> 50:22.849
Is she serious?

50:22.886 --> 50:24.478
Yeah. Our last great moment

50:24.521 --> 50:26.216
was the night the lights went out
in Rome,

50:26.256 --> 50:28.281
so I figured we'd pick up
where we left off.

50:30.360 --> 50:32.760
That's beautiful.
Please take my hand

50:32.796 --> 50:34.491
and I will lead you to your table.

50:35.732 --> 50:37.029
Let's make a train.

50:39.069 --> 50:44.302
Here we are. Now,
just follow me. Stay close.

50:44.341 --> 50:46.775
Just let your eyes take a back seat

50:46.810 --> 50:49.643
while your senses do the driving.

50:49.679 --> 50:51.840
It's furniture.

50:51.882 --> 50:54.407
That's a chair.
Very good. Very good.

50:54.451 --> 50:56.919
You wouldn't have gotten
to feel that chair if your eyes...

50:56.953 --> 50:59.183
Oh, my. Oh, my!

50:59.222 --> 51:02.157
- I'm so sorry. I am so sorry.
- What an adventure.

51:02.192 --> 51:04.456
All right. That's a head.
That's a man's head.

51:06.096 --> 51:07.791
- There are so many people!
- I think I broke something.

51:07.831 --> 51:10.299
Just keep coming forward.
That's a woman, sir.

51:10.333 --> 51:11.960
- Sorry.
- All right.

51:12.002 --> 51:15.199
Here's your table.
Now follow my voice to the chair.

51:15.238 --> 51:17.934
- Follow my voice to the chair.
- Right here?

51:17.974 --> 51:21.273
Where's my voice?
Your butt should go about here.

51:21.311 --> 51:25.475
I know you can't see this,
but you've got a gentleman.

51:25.515 --> 51:27.574
Let me help you with your jacket.

51:27.617 --> 51:30.552
It's a struggle because
of your muscles. Jeez!

51:30.587 --> 51:32.555
- Yeah.
- And here we are.

51:34.257 --> 51:37.283
Are you smelling me?

51:37.327 --> 51:41.787
OK. So, in just a few minutes,
your wine will be out.

51:41.832 --> 51:44.824
If you need anything at all,
just raise your hand,

51:44.868 --> 51:47.234
and one of our attendants
will assist you.

51:47.270 --> 51:50.899
Remember, you can't see us,
but we can see you.

51:53.844 --> 51:56.404
This is... This is kind of...

51:56.446 --> 51:58.038
- Kind of cool.
- Creepy.

51:58.081 --> 52:01.448
- It's awesome!
- I thought you had left.

52:01.485 --> 52:05.216
Your wine is being poured
in front of you at two o'clock. Enjoy.

52:07.023 --> 52:08.547
There you go.

52:08.592 --> 52:10.958
I hope you didn't order
anything expensive.

52:10.994 --> 52:12.393
She could have switched it
to a cheap bottle

52:12.429 --> 52:13.896
and we'd have no way of knowing.

52:13.930 --> 52:19.163
Still here.
And I would never do that, ever.

52:19.202 --> 52:21.227
You going to be there
the whole meal, or...

52:21.271 --> 52:22.863
No. I'm going to let
the two of you

52:22.906 --> 52:25.204
get to know each other
on a deeper level,

52:25.242 --> 52:28.803
and I'm going to go touch
other people in the restaurant.

52:28.845 --> 52:30.938
- OK, then. Thank you.
- Sure.

52:32.582 --> 52:35.312
I think she's finally gone.
It's really dark.

52:35.352 --> 52:37.684
I'll tell you this.
Even in the dark you're beautiful.

52:37.721 --> 52:39.985
This is actually kind of nice.

52:40.023 --> 52:41.752
This is the best I've felt since Rome.

52:41.791 --> 52:43.691
Beth, it's me! Al Russo.

52:43.727 --> 52:45.718
- I've been looking all over for you.
- Who's this?

52:45.762 --> 52:48.253
- Your liverwurst nightmare, pal.
- Oh, no.

52:50.267 --> 52:51.666
Ah, the feet...

52:52.903 --> 52:55.133
<i>Look who it is, principessa.</i>

52:55.172 --> 52:56.696
- Meatball!
- Sausage King!

52:56.740 --> 52:58.332
Does anyone have... the time?

52:58.375 --> 53:00.866
- Oh, God.
- Hey, my watch is missing.

53:00.911 --> 53:03.072
Try being gorgeous,
and no one can see you.

53:03.113 --> 53:04.410
- Who is that?
- Waiter?

53:04.447 --> 53:07.416
Feel like I'm driving a Lamborghini
around with a car cover on.

53:07.450 --> 53:09.918
Ordered an eight-pack? Please enjoy.

53:09.953 --> 53:12.786
I had a great time, but I got to go!

53:12.822 --> 53:16.087
"Great time?" We just got here!
Beth, wait. Beth...

53:16.126 --> 53:17.718
Ow!

53:17.761 --> 53:19.626
- Ma'am!
- What the hell is going on?

53:19.663 --> 53:21.654
People really drop
a lot of food in this place.

53:24.234 --> 53:26.202
Are you dark dining and dashing?

53:26.236 --> 53:27.703
I had her, and you blew it.

53:27.737 --> 53:29.705
He make her
disappear with magic.

53:29.739 --> 53:31.263
Bring her back, warlock!

53:31.308 --> 53:32.639
Taxi!

53:34.110 --> 53:36.271
- Beth!
- Please, just let me go.

53:36.313 --> 53:39.407
Do you mind telling me
what the hell just happened there?

53:40.317 --> 53:43.218
- How many guys are you seeing?
- I'm not see...

53:43.253 --> 53:45.448
You don't...
Those guys don't know me.

53:45.488 --> 53:48.048
They're just under a... spell.

53:48.091 --> 53:50.116
Beth! Beth, hi!

53:50.160 --> 53:52.685
Why don't you leave me alone!
I don't know you!

53:52.729 --> 53:57.291
Beth, it's me.
Your dentist. Dr. Moscowitz.

53:57.334 --> 53:59.234
Oh.

53:59.269 --> 54:03.706
- Sorry, Dr. Moscowitz. Hi.
- Everything OK?

54:03.740 --> 54:05.105
Oh, God, yeah.

54:05.141 --> 54:07.769
- And I'm flossing twice a day.
- Oh, good.

54:07.811 --> 54:12.043
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Your dentist? Are you OK?

54:12.082 --> 54:13.743
I just want to get out of here.

54:18.355 --> 54:20.186
OK.

54:20.223 --> 54:22.418
- Where do you want to go?
- I don't...

54:22.459 --> 54:23.926
Where would you feel safe?

54:31.234 --> 54:34.032
I used to come here with my parents
when I was a little girl.

54:36.706 --> 54:38.867
I thought this place was magic.

54:42.212 --> 54:46.410
And my father told me
that the roof was made of glass

54:46.449 --> 54:49.009
so that God could see the paintings
from up in heaven.

54:54.691 --> 54:55.953
Wow.

54:57.193 --> 54:58.421
I know.

55:01.598 --> 55:03.566
Her name was Marie-Therese Walter.

55:03.600 --> 55:07.331
She was 17 when Picasso
fell in love with her.

55:07.370 --> 55:11.830
Picasso was already married,
and 30 years her senior,

55:11.875 --> 55:14.275
so they kept their affair a secret.

55:14.311 --> 55:16.802
But he documented his passion

55:16.846 --> 55:19.610
by hiding her initials
in some of his paintings.

55:19.649 --> 55:24.985
Of course, Picasso wasn't
completely ready to settle down,

55:25.021 --> 55:28.684
and he left Marie-Therese for Dora Maar

55:28.725 --> 55:31.922
just like he left his wife Olga
for Marie-Therese.

55:34.064 --> 55:37.033
But Marie-Therese
never stopped loving Picasso.

55:40.003 --> 55:42.130
And she hung herself after his death.

55:48.678 --> 55:50.168
Hey...

55:52.582 --> 55:55.050
You OK?

55:55.085 --> 55:56.882
She just loved him so much,

55:56.920 --> 56:00.412
and in the end,
he didn't really love her back.

56:02.726 --> 56:05.058
It's just sad.

56:05.095 --> 56:08.121
You know, it doesn't always
have to be that way.

56:08.164 --> 56:11.463
Every time I've ever put myself
out there, I've gotten hurt.

56:12.802 --> 56:14.030
Every time.

56:16.106 --> 56:19.769
It's like I meet a guy,
and I think it's great.

56:19.809 --> 56:22.107
And anyone else
would just be thinking about

56:22.145 --> 56:24.045
how much greater it's going to get.

56:25.949 --> 56:29.009
And I'm constantly waiting
for the other shoe to drop.

56:32.222 --> 56:35.055
You know, lightning does strike
once in a while, Beth.

56:35.992 --> 56:37.459
Trust me. I know.

56:41.197 --> 56:42.789
I wish I could believe that.

56:42.832 --> 56:46.962
You can. No other shoes
are going to drop, Beth.

56:48.505 --> 56:49.904
This is real.

56:54.010 --> 56:55.477
I'm real.

57:12.362 --> 57:14.262
- Damn it!
- It's OK.

57:15.765 --> 57:17.096
- It's OK.
- One second.

57:21.037 --> 57:25.565
Six beers enter, no beers leave!

57:25.608 --> 57:27.599
What are you doing? Come on.

57:27.644 --> 57:30.306
Is she here? What's her name? Betsy?

57:30.346 --> 57:32.177
I hate you. You're ruining my life.

57:40.723 --> 57:45.023
- Aha, you found it.
- Oh, it's so beautiful.

57:46.162 --> 57:48.858
- And so sad.
- Yeah, it's OK.

57:56.206 --> 57:59.334
You know, every time I look at that,
all I think about is...

58:01.411 --> 58:05.245
...everything football
meant to me and my family

58:05.281 --> 58:08.216
and especially my old man.

58:08.251 --> 58:13.587
All the dreams... gone in an instant.

58:17.460 --> 58:19.291
That was the real hit.

58:45.722 --> 58:47.053
Oh, no.

58:53.096 --> 58:54.393
- What?
- I have to go.

58:54.430 --> 58:56.523
What's wrong? We can slow down.

58:56.566 --> 58:59.865
- I just have to go.
- Hold on, hold on.

58:59.903 --> 59:01.234
Hold on. Hey!

59:03.006 --> 59:05.406
- I don't get it.
- I know you don't, Nick.

59:06.376 --> 59:09.470
And you probably never will.

59:09.512 --> 59:13.380
But it's not real.
And it's never going to be real.

59:15.151 --> 59:16.641
What about the photograph?

59:19.188 --> 59:20.280
Keep it.

59:22.025 --> 59:24.118
I don't want to see you in pain.

59:55.625 --> 59:58.355
Is this all the programs?
I don't want to forget any.

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:04.366
Everything's gonna be OK, Beth.
I know it will.

01:00:05.902 --> 01:00:08.200
No, it's not.

01:00:09.839 --> 01:00:13.866
It's his chip. He's just under a spell.
It's not real.

01:00:19.382 --> 01:00:21.543
- Hello.
- Listen, I have great news.

01:00:21.584 --> 01:00:23.415
Umberto talked to his nana.

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:25.978
<i>She said there's another way
to break the spell.</i>

01:00:26.022 --> 01:00:27.148
- There is?
- Yeah.

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:30.182
All you have to do is return the coins
directly to the guys.

01:00:30.226 --> 01:00:31.659
It doesn't have to be the fountain.

01:00:31.694 --> 01:00:34.094
<i>Return the coin, return the love.</i>

01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:36.496
If I return the coins,
I return the love?

01:00:36.532 --> 01:00:38.022
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:00:38.067 --> 01:00:39.261
That'll break the spell?

01:00:39.302 --> 01:00:41.361
And that'll get me
out of this whole mess?

01:00:41.404 --> 01:00:45.033
<i>Yeah! It'll be all over.
Isn't that great?</i>

01:00:45.074 --> 01:00:49.170
<i>- Yeah. It's great.
- I knew you'd be relieved.</i>

01:00:49.212 --> 01:00:51.544
This is for your own good, boss.

01:00:51.581 --> 01:00:54.141
It's exactly what I wanted.

01:00:54.183 --> 01:00:56.413
<i>Yeah! Oh, I got to go.
Good luck at the show tonight.</i>

01:00:56.452 --> 01:00:57.510
<i>I'll call you later.</i>

01:00:57.553 --> 01:01:02.013
<i>- I love you, OK? Bye!
- OK.</i>

01:01:02.058 --> 01:01:05.425
Hey, boss, I'm gonna start setting up.
I'll see you at the Gugg.

01:01:44.333 --> 01:01:45.698
Wow.

01:01:47.336 --> 01:01:48.701
Come on in.

01:01:54.877 --> 01:01:56.674
OK.

01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:58.180
It's nice here. Very nice.

01:01:58.214 --> 01:02:00.978
I like what you do. It's sort of modern.

01:02:01.017 --> 01:02:02.917
- Very nice place.
- Beautiful.

01:02:02.952 --> 01:02:05.785
Really nice. You look great.
Are you excited for the show?

01:02:09.826 --> 01:02:11.885
You OK? You seem sad.

01:02:16.899 --> 01:02:19.265
This is going to be
harder than I thought. Um...

01:02:22.105 --> 01:02:24.300
I'm actually glad that you're all here.

01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:28.236
Just because I need
to tell you something.

01:02:28.277 --> 01:02:29.767
Oh.

01:02:29.812 --> 01:02:31.404
Come here.

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:42.987
The couch. You can sit on the couch.

01:02:43.025 --> 01:02:44.925
- You're gonna tell us on the couch?
- Yeah.

01:02:48.798 --> 01:02:50.425
I think she's gonna pick one of us.

01:02:50.466 --> 01:02:52.934
<i>Like The Bachelor.
I love this show, with the rose.</i>

01:02:52.969 --> 01:02:54.903
- I like my odds.
- It's you, it's you.

01:02:54.937 --> 01:02:56.529
Um...

01:02:59.542 --> 01:03:03.535
I don't know any other way
to say this, other than to just...

01:03:03.579 --> 01:03:04.739
You don't love me.

01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:07.648
- Trust me, I love you.
- No, you don't.

01:03:07.683 --> 01:03:10.584
- They don't, but I do.
- I love you so much.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:14.750
Well, I was drunk, but I took
the coins. I took your coins.

01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:18.090
- I do love you.
- It's not real. You don't love me.

01:03:18.127 --> 01:03:20.186
- As much as I can love someone.
- No, you don't.

01:03:20.229 --> 01:03:23.892
We're not in love with each other. I'm
in love with someone else. I love Nick.

01:03:28.671 --> 01:03:30.070
I love Nick.

01:03:36.179 --> 01:03:41.811
I love Nick more than I love my job,
which is big for me.

01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:46.546
And it's not your fault,
and I'm really sorry.

01:03:46.589 --> 01:03:49.114
I love him even if
he might not love me back.

01:03:52.128 --> 01:03:53.595
You know?

01:03:55.431 --> 01:03:59.731
I understand loving somebody and...

01:03:59.769 --> 01:04:01.896
...them not loving you back.

01:04:01.938 --> 01:04:04.270
We all do.

01:04:05.942 --> 01:04:09.400
- It's a bummer.
- This really suck.

01:04:09.445 --> 01:04:12.005
I'm sorry, guys.

01:04:15.451 --> 01:04:17.385
OK...

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:22.915
The whole point of love is to put
someone else's needs above your own.

01:04:22.959 --> 01:04:27.362
Maybe that's why I'm here.
Maybe that's why we're all here.

01:04:27.396 --> 01:04:30.024
Maybe for you.

01:04:30.066 --> 01:04:33.058
- He may be on to something.
- No, it's true.

01:04:33.102 --> 01:04:37.732
- How can we help?
- Thanks, guys.

01:04:37.773 --> 01:04:42.642
And this will all be a little clearer
when I give you something back.

01:04:46.849 --> 01:04:47.975
Oh, no.

01:04:49.852 --> 01:04:51.217
Stacy.

01:04:55.591 --> 01:04:58.685
- What the heck is...?
- What?

01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:01.891
- That was weird.
- I swear, that wasn't me.

01:05:01.931 --> 01:05:03.262
It was just...

01:05:05.334 --> 01:05:08.792
<i>...freak electrical storm has caused
rolling blackouts and gridlock</i>

01:05:08.838 --> 01:05:12.638
<i>throughout the city. Traffic lights
are out throughout the metro area.</i>

01:05:12.675 --> 01:05:15.701
<i>New York City is at a standstill.</i>

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:18.714
- We got to stay in.
- I make food for everybody. We eat.

01:05:18.748 --> 01:05:21.876
No, no, no. We're not staying here.
You're not staying here.

01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:25.752
I need to be at the Guggenheim.
This has to end now.

01:05:26.389 --> 01:05:27.413
After we eat.

01:05:28.624 --> 01:05:30.489
Hold it, hold it.

01:05:30.526 --> 01:05:34.690
If we love her, we'll get her to the
Guggenheim. That's all there is to it.

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:40.167
Let's do this.

01:05:40.202 --> 01:05:43.171
I'll do it. And I'm going to do it
with more flair than all of you.

01:05:43.205 --> 01:05:46.265
<i>We take my car.
I just bring her from Italia.</i>

01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:48.641
<i>- You have a car?
- It's molto grande.</i>

01:05:48.678 --> 01:05:51.613
For one, two... No, it be fine.

01:05:53.716 --> 01:05:55.308
Come on! Move it!

01:05:55.351 --> 01:05:57.319
- Comfortable up there?
- Where's the keys?

01:05:57.353 --> 01:05:59.514
I had the keys in your apartment.

01:05:59.555 --> 01:06:02.319
- Have the key.
- Give him the keys.

01:06:02.358 --> 01:06:03.985
Ay-yay-yay!

01:06:04.026 --> 01:06:06.620
- I am what I am.
- Annoying.

01:06:06.662 --> 01:06:08.823
Who makes this car, Fisher-Price?

01:06:08.864 --> 01:06:11.128
<i>In Italia this is a midsize car.</i>

01:06:11.167 --> 01:06:12.691
In America it's a clown car.

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:21.667
Careful.

01:06:21.711 --> 01:06:24.839
<i>- It's Stacy. Leave a message.
- Please call me when you get this.</i>

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:27.610
And don't do anything
with those coins. I'm on my way.

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:30.676
- I was expecting a little bit bigger.
- Oh, tiny bit, huh?

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:34.383
Hit the horn. Thread the needle.
See if you can go around this guy.

01:06:34.423 --> 01:06:38.189
- Just drive like you're in Rome.
- No problem.

01:06:43.432 --> 01:06:45.093
Hey, coming through!

01:06:51.507 --> 01:06:52.769
I'm OK.

01:06:54.143 --> 01:06:55.770
If you can't reach the dashboard,

01:06:55.811 --> 01:06:58.279
and you wanna hold onto
the washboards, let me know.

01:07:00.316 --> 01:07:02.511
There's a fat guy on a bike.
A fat guy on a bike.

01:07:08.724 --> 01:07:10.316
Sorry about that.

01:07:10.359 --> 01:07:13.886
I'll give you a thousand bucks
to let me sit in front.

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.127
- OK, that hurt.
- Damn it!

01:07:19.168 --> 01:07:20.362
Come on up.

01:07:25.941 --> 01:07:27.431
There's the Gugg!

01:07:35.351 --> 01:07:37.285
Coming through!

01:07:37.319 --> 01:07:39.879
- You can just let me out here.
- No, not close enough.

01:07:39.922 --> 01:07:41.549
I take you right upstairs.

01:07:49.799 --> 01:07:53.929
- No, Antonio. The doors!
- I got this. You must all believe.

01:07:53.969 --> 01:07:55.561
- I don't believe!
- I don't believe!

01:07:55.604 --> 01:07:56.662
I believe!

01:07:58.107 --> 01:07:59.369
Open!

01:08:05.347 --> 01:08:06.837
I did it!

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:18.720
Could you push five?

01:08:46.654 --> 01:08:48.054
Stacy.

01:08:59.468 --> 01:09:03.461
Beth. There you are.
You're a hit. They love the show.

01:09:03.506 --> 01:09:05.474
The Petrocelli is... How?

01:09:05.508 --> 01:09:08.568
Nick sent it over late this afternoon.
People cried when they saw it.

01:09:08.611 --> 01:09:10.772
- And Celeste is...
- Pleased.

01:09:10.813 --> 01:09:14.475
We've already received a record number
of financial pledges tonight, Beth.

01:09:14.517 --> 01:09:17.747
I'm very proud of you.
You're a wonderful curator.

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:24.557
Anyone who would care to join me in
the Thannhauser, please come this way.

01:09:26.194 --> 01:09:30.564
Stacy... I need the coins.

01:09:30.599 --> 01:09:34.466
But look at what's happened, Beth.
Nick did all of this for you.

01:09:34.502 --> 01:09:36.733
- He loves you.
- I know.

01:09:36.772 --> 01:09:41.573
But if I take his love against his will,
that's not love at all.

01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:47.337
Please, Stacy. The coins.
I have to do this my way.

01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:49.448
You are not going
to the Guggenheim.

01:09:49.484 --> 01:09:50.679
This isn't my scene.

01:09:50.719 --> 01:09:53.688
What are you talking about?
We're neck-deep in hot ladies.

01:09:53.721 --> 01:09:56.919
LT is here. What up, son?

01:09:56.959 --> 01:09:59.757
- LT!
- Man, what's your damn problem?

01:09:59.795 --> 01:10:01.592
He knows his name.
Where are you going?

01:10:01.630 --> 01:10:03.564
Hey, how's it going?
We're from the network.

01:10:03.599 --> 01:10:06.261
Good to see you. We're big fans.
We read your column every week.

01:10:06.302 --> 01:10:07.530
Thank you.

01:10:07.570 --> 01:10:09.970
Somebody we wanted
to introduce you to. Nick, Shaq.

01:10:10.005 --> 01:10:12.496
- How you doing? Read your article.
- Good. Yeah?

01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:16.443
- Spelled my name wrong.
- It's the proofreading department.

01:10:16.478 --> 01:10:18.309
- This guy right here?
- Yeah, this guy.

01:10:19.415 --> 01:10:21.645
Excuse me, I've got
to take this phone call.

01:10:21.684 --> 01:10:24.209
- You don't know how to spell?
- I don't know anything.

01:10:24.253 --> 01:10:26.619
Beth. Hey, how are you?

01:10:26.655 --> 01:10:29.180
<i>Nick, there's something
I want to tell you.</i>

01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:31.455
Even though it won't matter
after tonight.

01:10:31.493 --> 01:10:36.157
I want to thank you...
for making me believe in love again.

01:10:37.499 --> 01:10:42.436
Even if it wasn't real for you,
it was very real for me.

01:10:42.471 --> 01:10:43.529
What does that mean?

01:10:45.474 --> 01:10:47.374
Beth. Beth!

01:10:57.987 --> 01:11:00.683
Hey!

01:11:10.399 --> 01:11:13.163
I'm guessing this belongs to you?

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:15.294
Does it?

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:19.837
Check your purse.

01:11:22.344 --> 01:11:25.040
OK, stop it. I need you to take this.

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:26.513
Come on. Close your hand.

01:11:26.548 --> 01:11:28.413
- Wait, I have another trick.
- Nope.

01:11:36.659 --> 01:11:38.024
Now I remember.

01:11:40.462 --> 01:11:42.487
I never had the guts
to perform in public

01:11:42.531 --> 01:11:46.831
until I wanted to do it for you.
I guess I just needed a muse.

01:11:46.869 --> 01:11:49.167
What am I going to do without you?

01:11:49.204 --> 01:11:52.640
You'll find your muse. Your true muse.

01:11:52.675 --> 01:11:55.075
Trust me, you won't be sorry.

01:12:01.784 --> 01:12:03.251
Are you a coin collector?

01:12:11.894 --> 01:12:13.828
When I threw this coin in the fountain

01:12:13.862 --> 01:12:17.855
I wasn't wishing
that my wife would come back.

01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:18.992
I knew that wouldn't happen.

01:12:19.034 --> 01:12:25.030
I was just wishing to get a chance to
feel the way I did when she was around.

01:12:25.908 --> 01:12:27.136
And...

01:12:29.445 --> 01:12:32.141
...my wish came true. You gave me that.

01:12:34.883 --> 01:12:36.043
Thank you.

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:41.417
Hey!

01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:51.294
Come on!

01:12:52.568 --> 01:12:53.694
Is this your euro?

01:13:03.245 --> 01:13:06.908
- That's weird.
- Antonio?

01:13:06.949 --> 01:13:10.248
- It's Anthony, actually.
- From Nunzio?

01:13:10.285 --> 01:13:16.053
- No. Newark. New Jersey.
- Are you really a tortured artist?

01:13:16.091 --> 01:13:20.187
Tortured. Been in retail shoe sales
for the last nine years.

01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:24.256
As far as being an artist, I guess
I figured going to Italy'd make me one.

01:13:25.801 --> 01:13:27.962
I think you're an artist.

01:13:28.003 --> 01:13:32.372
I do. And I'm not just saying that
because I'm trying to get rid of you.

01:13:32.408 --> 01:13:35.844
- It's my professional opinion.
- Thank you.

01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:47.448
I think I'll miss you least of all.

01:13:52.428 --> 01:13:57.297
Honestly, I don't think
I really learned anything.

01:13:57.332 --> 01:14:01.564
- No?
- But I had a blast helping you grow.

01:14:01.603 --> 01:14:03.195
You're welcome.

01:14:03.972 --> 01:14:05.405
Mmm.

01:14:06.175 --> 01:14:07.972
Good luck. It's all right.

01:14:12.381 --> 01:14:14.440
- What's going on?
- All the lights are out.

01:14:14.483 --> 01:14:16.280
Some kind of freak electrical storm.

01:14:16.318 --> 01:14:19.810
I wouldn't cross there if I were you!
That's suicide, pal!

01:14:21.657 --> 01:14:22.919
Crap, not again.

01:14:26.562 --> 01:14:29.998
I didn't see that one coming.

01:14:32.868 --> 01:14:35.803
- That was both our faults, really.
- What are you doing here?

01:14:35.838 --> 01:14:38.466
Didn't think I was going to let
my boy do this alone, did you?

01:14:38.507 --> 01:14:42.307
- I feel safer. Thank you.
- Does she have a sister?

01:14:42.344 --> 01:14:44.209
- She's married.
- Dammit.

01:14:44.246 --> 01:14:46.305
Come on. Get in.

01:14:47.683 --> 01:14:49.378
You're buying me a new windshield.

01:14:49.418 --> 01:14:52.182
- Don't kick my car. I'll hit you again!
- I'm OK, by the way.

01:14:52.221 --> 01:14:54.781
- I'm fine. Don't worry about me.
- Good. I don't care.

01:14:57.693 --> 01:14:58.887
And I guess there's one more.

01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:02.720
Looking for something?

01:15:03.599 --> 01:15:04.896
I need that.

01:15:07.870 --> 01:15:10.668
Oopsie-daisy, where'd it go?

01:15:10.706 --> 01:15:12.765
Oh, there they are.

01:15:13.709 --> 01:15:15.336
Now, there's two.

01:15:15.377 --> 01:15:17.242
- Back to one.
- Give it to me!

01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:10.464
So, I guess it's over now, huh?

01:16:10.499 --> 01:16:15.334
- Is that really what you want?
- It doesn't matter what I want.

01:16:17.005 --> 01:16:19.030
You've got your will back.

01:16:21.009 --> 01:16:25.002
Ever since I saw you
in that fountain something...

01:16:25.047 --> 01:16:28.949
...something changed in me.
I can't eat. I can't sleep.

01:16:28.984 --> 01:16:31.578
I can't do anything
without thinking about you.

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:33.383
I don't know what is going on with me,

01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:35.413
but I want to know
what is going on with you.

01:16:35.457 --> 01:16:38.551
You seem to think that all these guys
are under some crazy spell,

01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:42.894
and that I'm one of them, but I'm not.
This is real, OK?

01:16:42.931 --> 01:16:45.627
And I ran all the way up Fifth Avenue
in a lightning storm

01:16:45.667 --> 01:16:48.932
- because I wanted to tell you...
- You love me?

01:16:48.971 --> 01:16:51.633
- I never said I loved you.
- You didn't. No, you don't.

01:16:51.673 --> 01:16:54.972
I just never said it. You said it,
and I wanted to say it, but...

01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:58.673
OK, you go. You say it.
Well, say it if you want to say it.

01:16:58.714 --> 01:16:59.976
Look...

01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:03.114
The only spell that I'm under...

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:06.446
...is yours.

01:17:11.693 --> 01:17:13.593
I'm in love with you, Beth.

01:17:32.981 --> 01:17:36.417
- Oh. Did she invite you, too?
- Yeah. Tony.

01:17:36.451 --> 01:17:38.009
- Gale.
- Yeah.

01:17:38.053 --> 01:17:40.044
- Nice to see you.
- Yeah. You, too.

01:17:40.088 --> 01:17:41.953
You look great.
That's a nice cut.

01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:43.218
You look terrific.

01:17:43.258 --> 01:17:45.351
Beautiful silhouette.
I saw you out there.

01:17:45.394 --> 01:17:48.056
- You can hold a suit. Yeah.
- Thank you.

01:17:48.096 --> 01:17:50.394
- You're an artist.
- Yeah. Sort of.

01:17:50.432 --> 01:17:52.161
I would love to do a nude with you.

01:17:53.568 --> 01:17:54.694
I'd like that.

01:17:55.771 --> 01:17:57.363
Great.

01:17:57.406 --> 01:17:59.636
I'd really like that.

01:17:59.675 --> 01:18:03.577
I am really sorry about this,
Beth. This is all my fault.

01:18:03.612 --> 01:18:07.309
I found that in my bag of tricks.

01:18:10.085 --> 01:18:13.521
- It's not mine, so...
- Oh, my God. It's Nick's.

01:18:13.555 --> 01:18:16.524
I guess I accidentally gave you
the wrong chip in the museum.

01:18:16.558 --> 01:18:18.549
He's still under the spell.

01:18:18.593 --> 01:18:22.495
- OK, thank you. Time to go.
- Are you her sister?

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:24.556
- Would you like to see an illusion?
- Bye-bye.

01:18:24.599 --> 01:18:25.964
Don't you want to be dazzled?

01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:31.799
- Oh, my God, Beth. I'm so sorry.
- What am I going to do?

01:18:32.641 --> 01:18:33.801
Showtime.

01:18:35.243 --> 01:18:37.074
Dad.

01:18:37.112 --> 01:18:42.106
When you married Mom, did you
ever think that you wouldn't make it?

01:18:43.585 --> 01:18:47.487
Elizabeth Ann.

01:18:47.522 --> 01:18:51.424
Honey, you cannot learn
from my mistakes.

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:54.452
You're going to have to go out there
and make your own.

01:18:54.496 --> 01:18:58.159
Now, you could get your heart broken or

01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:02.603
you could have the greatest
love affair the world has ever known,

01:19:02.637 --> 01:19:07.074
but you're not going to know
unless you try.

01:19:07.109 --> 01:19:11.603
But what if there was a guarantee
that you'd never get hurt.

01:19:11.646 --> 01:19:16.242
Baby... the passion is in the risk.

01:19:18.153 --> 01:19:21.281
It's like I always say,
"If you're going to be a bear..."

01:19:21.323 --> 01:19:24.690
- "Be a grizzly."
- That's my girl.

01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:36.959
A marriage is like all contracts

01:20:36.998 --> 01:20:41.332
that the two enter under the eyes
of Our Father Almighty.

01:20:41.369 --> 01:20:47.330
If there's anybody here
who has reasons that Beth...

01:20:47.375 --> 01:20:51.209
...and Nicholas should not
get married today,

01:20:51.246 --> 01:20:55.649
speak now or forever
hold on to your peaces.

01:20:56.618 --> 01:20:57.642
Anybody?

01:20:59.087 --> 01:21:00.679
Anybody?

01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:05.288
Anybody?

01:21:05.327 --> 01:21:08.228
It could be anybody. You don't
have to know them to speak up.

01:21:08.263 --> 01:21:12.063
OK, padre, it seems nobody's objecting,
so let's move on with it.

01:21:14.936 --> 01:21:19.236
Do you, Nicholas, take Beth
to be your awful wedded wife?

01:21:19.274 --> 01:21:24.234
"Lawful." Yes. Yes, I do.

01:21:31.019 --> 01:21:32.919
What is with him?

01:21:32.954 --> 01:21:36.287
And do you, Beth, take Nicholas to be
your awful wedded husband?

01:21:36.324 --> 01:21:40.317
<i>To love, amore, to honor</i>

01:21:40.362 --> 01:21:43.661
<i>until morte, death, do you part?</i>

01:21:46.167 --> 01:21:52.072
<i>Think, bella.
It's a very big responsibility, no?</i>

01:21:58.013 --> 01:21:59.037
No.

01:22:02.817 --> 01:22:05.945
I can't do this to you, Nick. I'm sorry.

01:22:37.385 --> 01:22:39.478
You think you're pretty funny,
don't you?

01:22:43.658 --> 01:22:46.491
Did you enjoy watching me go crazy?

01:22:46.528 --> 01:22:51.329
Did you have fun watching my life
turn upside down because of love?

01:22:53.301 --> 01:22:55.531
Because I did.

01:22:55.570 --> 01:22:57.333
Beth!

01:22:58.139 --> 01:22:59.606
Beth!

01:23:06.047 --> 01:23:08.675
I've got a question.

01:23:08.717 --> 01:23:11.151
Why do you keep giving me
my poker chips?

01:23:11.186 --> 01:23:14.485
Because you deserve to have it back.

01:23:14.522 --> 01:23:17.286
You threw it in the fountain
and wished for love,

01:23:17.325 --> 01:23:19.555
and I don't want to keep it anymore.

01:23:20.695 --> 01:23:23.163
- No, I didn't.
- You didn't?

01:23:23.198 --> 01:23:26.031
- No.
- Then who did?

01:23:26.935 --> 01:23:28.266
I have no idea.

01:23:29.771 --> 01:23:31.739
Then this is all real?

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:40.770
How's this for real?

01:23:46.054 --> 01:23:48.420
Free of temptation!

01:23:54.562 --> 01:23:57.725
Didn't you say
at Umberto's bachelor party...

01:23:57.766 --> 01:24:00.496
The padre cleaned me out
at the poker table. Yeah.
