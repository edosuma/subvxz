WEBVTT

00:03.433 --> 00:05.836
That spa weekend was amazing.

00:05.837 --> 00:07.270
Getting massages,

00:07.271 --> 00:10.307
eating those delicious
sundaes from room service.

00:10.308 --> 00:12.242
Oh, and that half a
lobster those people left

00:12.243 --> 00:14.177
on the tray outside their door.

00:14.178 --> 00:15.545
Oh.

00:15.546 --> 00:18.348
It was like being in heaven with a goat.

00:18.349 --> 00:20.550
Hey, Felix.

00:20.551 --> 00:22.519
How was your weekend
at French pastry school?

00:22.520 --> 00:24.755
It was stupÃ©fiant.

00:24.756 --> 00:26.789
I knew it would be stupid.

00:28.792 --> 00:29.993
What is that smell?

00:29.994 --> 00:32.028
- Birds!
- Birds!

00:32.029 --> 00:35.298
Oscar, Is that the trash I asked
you to take out before we left?

00:35.299 --> 00:37.501
Maybe, or maybe it's a
different bag of trash

00:37.502 --> 00:39.001
that the pigeons dragged in!

00:39.970 --> 00:41.772
You also left the balcony door open!

00:41.773 --> 00:43.440
Or maybe the pigeons...

00:43.441 --> 00:45.024
- Stop blaming the pigeons!
- All right.

00:45.025 --> 00:47.010
Oscar, I asked you to do one thing.

00:47.011 --> 00:48.645
How did you let this happen?

00:48.646 --> 00:50.547
I'm off to French pastry school.

00:50.548 --> 00:52.582
It's going to be stupid.

00:52.583 --> 00:55.952
Don't forget to take the
trash to the garbage chute.

00:55.953 --> 00:58.121
I got it, I got it.

00:58.122 --> 01:00.157
Bonne weekend.

01:00.158 --> 01:01.891
That's the plan.

01:04.361 --> 01:06.329
Oh, my God.

01:06.330 --> 01:08.598
That cloud looks just like a wiener.

01:08.599 --> 01:11.901
Oh, I got to get a picture of this.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:22.145 --> 01:24.347
Oh, wait.

01:24.348 --> 01:26.171
There was something I
had to do before I left.

01:26.172 --> 01:27.250
Oh, right.

01:27.251 --> 01:30.219
Send Teddy a photo of that penis cloud.

01:33.390 --> 01:36.827
It really does.

01:36.828 --> 01:38.161
I don't believe you.

01:38.162 --> 01:40.397
Well, that's why I have
proof. I took a picture.

01:40.398 --> 01:41.998
Look. See? It has two giant...

01:41.999 --> 01:44.566
I'm not interested in
your cloud genitalia.

01:45.669 --> 01:47.671
I am interested in you
taking responsibility

01:47.672 --> 01:49.105
for your actions.

01:49.106 --> 01:50.607
What's the big deal?

01:50.608 --> 01:52.676
Pigeons are gone. Trash is gone.

01:52.677 --> 01:54.643
Everything's clean. It's over.

01:58.748 --> 02:01.173
Not helping my argument, big guy.

02:01.889 --> 02:05.354
Subtitle sync and corrections by

02:05.356 --> 02:08.157
I asked him to do one thing.

02:08.158 --> 02:10.160
Why do I always expect him to grow up?

02:10.161 --> 02:12.689
- You're an optimist.
- You're dumb.

02:12.690 --> 02:14.754
And it's not just me. Thanks
to Oscar's unique blend

02:14.755 --> 02:15.899
of sounds and smells,

02:15.900 --> 02:17.968
our upstairs neighbor
Mr. Novak, just moved out.

02:17.969 --> 02:20.337
It's not like Mr. Novak was a
sound and smell party himself.

02:20.338 --> 02:21.805
Mm-mm.

02:21.806 --> 02:24.774
I love Oscar, but living
with him is impossible.

02:24.775 --> 02:28.044
You know, I love Felix, but
living with him is impossible.

02:28.045 --> 02:30.480
I'm sorry, sweetie.

02:30.481 --> 02:32.582
Yeah. It's always, "Feet
off the couch, Oscar.

02:32.583 --> 02:34.317
"Feet off the table, Oscar.

02:34.318 --> 02:37.019
Feet out of the refrigerator, Oscar."

02:37.854 --> 02:39.054
They get really hot.

02:40.557 --> 02:43.860
Well, you could move in here.

02:43.861 --> 02:45.595
Did you just ask me to move in with you?

02:45.596 --> 02:48.164
Tell me what you think, and
I'll tell you if I asked you.

02:48.165 --> 02:50.033
Well, we did just spend
five days together,

02:50.034 --> 02:51.368
and it was pretty perfect.

02:51.369 --> 02:53.036
We even shared a bathroom.

02:53.037 --> 02:55.005
And that little foot washer.

02:55.006 --> 02:56.705
That was a bidet.

02:58.008 --> 02:59.242
But yes.

02:59.243 --> 03:01.011
The trip was great. We're great.

03:01.012 --> 03:03.580
Why wouldn't we move in together?

03:03.581 --> 03:05.181
And Evan loves you. It'd be good for him

03:05.182 --> 03:06.725
to have a male influence in the house.

03:06.726 --> 03:10.921
Yeah, but what would Felix
do for a male influence?

03:10.922 --> 03:12.689
He's a grown man. I think he'll be okay.

03:12.690 --> 03:13.924
I don't know.

03:13.925 --> 03:17.827
I'm kind of the glue that
holds that guy together.

03:17.828 --> 03:19.796
I'm gonna have to let him down gently.

03:19.797 --> 03:22.232
What emoji would you use?

03:22.233 --> 03:25.969
Is there one that means
"I'm going to have a mature,

03:25.970 --> 03:28.605
face-to-face conversation
with my friend"?

03:28.606 --> 03:31.274
No, but there is a cat with heart eyes.

03:31.275 --> 03:33.576
Look at that.

03:33.577 --> 03:37.346
That-that cat is loving something.

03:38.548 --> 03:39.783
Aha.

03:41.352 --> 03:45.254
You are a noble reminder
of a disgusting man.

03:46.089 --> 03:47.457
Hey, uh, Felix.

03:49.126 --> 03:51.261
I kind of need to talk to you.

03:51.262 --> 03:52.862
Why don't you have a seat?

03:52.863 --> 03:54.166
The last time you asked me that,

03:54.167 --> 03:57.233
I was the victim of
a whoopee cushioning.

03:57.234 --> 03:59.035
It's, uh, Charlotte.

03:59.036 --> 04:00.737
She's all over me to move in with her.

04:00.738 --> 04:02.472
She is?! Uh, I mean,

04:02.473 --> 04:04.574
- she is?
- Yeah.

04:04.575 --> 04:06.710
I mean, of course I said, "No way, Jose.

04:06.711 --> 04:08.645
- I'm not leaving my buddy Felix."
- Oh.

04:08.646 --> 04:10.747
I would be devastated.

04:10.748 --> 04:12.782
I mean, I-I don't want
to stand in the way

04:12.783 --> 04:14.684
of your budding
relationship with Charlotte.

04:14.685 --> 04:16.653
So you'd be okay with it?

04:16.654 --> 04:19.055
Uh, other than the
aforementioned devastation,

04:19.055 --> 04:20.422
Yes, I mean...

04:21.624 --> 04:22.959
You're a great couple.

04:22.960 --> 04:25.128
It's wonderful what her
yin does for your yang.

04:25.129 --> 04:26.795
Hmm.

04:28.031 --> 04:30.899
It's pronounced "Wang," buddy.

04:32.822 --> 04:34.342
I mean, I'd still be in here for work,

04:34.343 --> 04:36.047
so we'd get to see
each other all the time.

04:36.048 --> 04:38.208
In a way, it would be
like you never moved out.

04:38.209 --> 04:40.944
But you will, to be clear.

04:40.945 --> 04:42.445
Yeah. We'll get to hang
out without the tension

04:42.446 --> 04:43.789
of being having to live together.

04:43.790 --> 04:45.315
Not that there was any tension.

04:45.316 --> 04:48.651
No...

04:48.652 --> 04:51.721
No. We may even become better friends.

04:51.722 --> 04:53.823
I mean A... we couldn't
be better friends.

04:53.824 --> 04:56.526
And B... maybe we could.

04:56.527 --> 04:59.896
You moving out could be
the best thing for us,

04:59.897 --> 05:01.698
our friendship, our future.

05:01.699 --> 05:02.532
Put 'er there!

05:02.533 --> 05:03.767
I think actually this might

05:03.768 --> 05:04.768
call for a hug.

05:04.769 --> 05:05.949
I think you might be right.

05:07.137 --> 05:08.204
Ah.

05:08.205 --> 05:10.240
- This is gonna be tough.
- So tough.

05:20.365 --> 05:22.833
Well, Terrance, I'm meeting
with a few other applicants,

05:22.834 --> 05:25.369
but you made a great first impression.

05:25.370 --> 05:26.713
May I offer you an hors d'oeuvre?

05:26.714 --> 05:28.672
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh, whoops.

05:28.673 --> 05:30.741
Five second rule, right?

05:30.742 --> 05:33.110
Yeah, it's still good, right?

05:33.111 --> 05:34.645
Wrong!

05:34.646 --> 05:37.446
There is no five second
rule. Good day, sir.

05:43.553 --> 05:45.055
Another dud, huh?

05:45.056 --> 05:46.799
Yes. In a city of
millions, I don't know why

05:46.800 --> 05:48.458
I can't find one decent applicant.

05:48.459 --> 05:50.360
Well, maybe it's the personality test

05:50.361 --> 05:52.665
followed by the interview,
followed by the apartment tour,

05:52.666 --> 05:54.965
which is really just a series
of undercover challenges.

05:54.966 --> 05:57.867
Well, I'm just trying
to weed out the "Oscars."

05:58.869 --> 06:00.737
- No offense.
- Oh, none taken.

06:00.738 --> 06:04.341
I know it's just a figure of speech.

06:04.342 --> 06:06.845
Hey, Oscar, I'm getting hungry
for my "helping you move" lunch.

06:06.846 --> 06:08.312
Oh, okay. Felix, you want to come?

06:08.313 --> 06:10.296
Sorry, I can't; I'm waiting
for my next applicant.

06:10.297 --> 06:11.815
His name is Neil.

06:11.816 --> 06:14.718
It says here he is an efficiency expert.

06:19.389 --> 06:21.557
That must be him.

06:24.461 --> 06:26.330
Felix Unger?

06:26.331 --> 06:28.899
Neil Armstrong.

06:28.900 --> 06:30.534
I'm sorry.

06:30.535 --> 06:33.337
Your name is Neil Armstrong?

06:33.338 --> 06:35.505
Let me give you my standard reply:

06:35.506 --> 06:38.041
No, not that Neil Armstrong.

06:38.042 --> 06:40.677
I've never been on the moon,
but I'm always on the ball.

06:40.678 --> 06:42.212
So you were...

06:42.213 --> 06:43.780
No, I was not named after him.

06:43.781 --> 06:44.915
- So it's...
- Yes.

06:44.916 --> 06:47.684
- Pure coincidence.
- Wow. He really is on the ball.

06:47.685 --> 06:49.586
I already said that.

06:52.556 --> 06:55.091
Well, you're a lot of fun.

06:58.829 --> 07:00.497
That's the old roommate?

07:00.498 --> 07:02.032
What a mess.

07:02.033 --> 07:04.601
- I like you already, Neil Armstrong.
- Hmm.

07:04.602 --> 07:08.538
Great ergonomics. Exceptional flow.

07:08.539 --> 07:10.574
I assume you start dusting

07:10.575 --> 07:11.875
from that corner

07:11.876 --> 07:15.812
and work your way clockwise.

07:15.813 --> 07:17.814
Actually, I start high and I work low.

07:17.815 --> 07:20.350
Hmm. The Pendrake Method.

07:20.351 --> 07:22.085
I didn't know anybody used that anymore.

07:22.086 --> 07:24.988
I suppose you are
saving more arm strokes.

07:24.989 --> 07:26.256
- That's the idea.
- Oh.

07:26.257 --> 07:29.760
But with the sunlight
at your back you can see

07:29.761 --> 07:31.561
twice the dust, saving...

07:31.562 --> 07:36.133
- More strokes.
- ...more strokes.

07:36.134 --> 07:39.536
May I offer you a snack?

07:39.537 --> 07:40.971
- Oh.
- Oh, whoops.

07:40.972 --> 07:42.773
Five second rule.

07:42.774 --> 07:45.675
We both know there is no such thing.

07:45.676 --> 07:48.544
When can you move in?

07:49.479 --> 07:51.314
Sorry, guys. I forgot my wallet.

07:51.315 --> 07:53.116
Ah, floor snacks.

07:53.117 --> 07:55.417
You guys really missed out.

08:00.490 --> 08:01.658
Hey, you're home.

08:01.659 --> 08:03.693
I've never been so happy to see you.

08:03.694 --> 08:05.228
- Aw.
- Yeah.

08:05.229 --> 08:07.297
I thought I was going
to starve to death.

08:07.298 --> 08:11.101
Oh. I texted you there's
chicken in the fridge.

08:11.102 --> 08:13.070
Yeah, but that was raw.

08:13.071 --> 08:15.605
I assumed you'd cook it.

08:15.606 --> 08:16.973
Felix never let me do that.

08:16.974 --> 08:18.341
Actually, I was banned

08:18.342 --> 08:21.078
from all fire-based appliances.

08:21.079 --> 08:24.014
Also knives, graters, juicers, choppers.

08:24.015 --> 08:25.515
I'll send you the "no-no" list.

08:25.516 --> 08:28.485
You're kidding.

08:28.486 --> 08:31.221
No. I haven't cooked in three years.

08:31.222 --> 08:33.222
Am I pronouncing that right?

08:33.224 --> 08:34.857
"Cooked"?

08:34.859 --> 08:38.160
Well, not only will I let you cook,

08:38.162 --> 08:40.163
I'll encourage it. I
think it's important

08:40.164 --> 08:42.100
for our relationship that
we share the housework.

08:42.101 --> 08:43.033
Absolutely.

08:43.034 --> 08:44.034
We're a team.

08:44.034 --> 08:46.036
For example,

08:46.037 --> 08:47.904
have you noticed our laundry basket

08:47.905 --> 08:49.439
is getting full?

08:49.440 --> 08:51.141
I have noticed that.

08:51.142 --> 08:54.510
And tomorrow I'm gonna go
buy a bigger laundry basket.

08:55.378 --> 08:58.682
Or you could just do the laundry.

08:58.683 --> 09:01.451
Yeah. Okay.

09:01.452 --> 09:04.387
I'll go get the clothes and
go down to the laundry room.

09:04.388 --> 09:06.056
Follow-up question.

09:06.057 --> 09:06.990
It's in the basement.

09:06.991 --> 09:09.191
All right.

09:20.470 --> 09:21.905
Good morning.

09:21.906 --> 09:24.207
I hope I didn't wake you
before you intended to awaken.

09:24.208 --> 09:25.542
Oh.

09:25.543 --> 09:27.410
No. I'm always up at this hour.

09:27.411 --> 09:29.646
Internal clock, no
alarm needed, whatever.

09:29.647 --> 09:32.883
Is this room cleaner
than it was yesterday?

09:32.884 --> 09:34.351
Oh, quite a bit so.

09:34.352 --> 09:36.987
I do my best tidying
up just after sunrise.

09:36.988 --> 09:38.890
And did you vacuum?
Because these are not

09:38.891 --> 09:40.357
my usual north-south lines.

09:40.358 --> 09:43.460
Oh, I didn't vacuum, Vicki did.

09:43.461 --> 09:44.661
Vicki, come.

09:51.101 --> 09:54.638
Is that the VacoVic 52-G?

09:54.639 --> 09:56.503
I thought that didn't
come out until next year.

09:56.504 --> 09:57.374
She doesn't,

09:57.375 --> 09:59.075
at least not to the general public.

09:59.076 --> 10:01.678
I actually consulted on
the design team, so...

10:01.679 --> 10:03.747
State of the art filtration,

10:03.748 --> 10:06.349
whisper quiet, fully integrated AI.

10:06.350 --> 10:07.918
It's, um...

10:07.919 --> 10:10.620
It's beautiful.

10:10.621 --> 10:11.721
Thank you.

10:11.722 --> 10:13.056
Aw.

10:13.057 --> 10:16.593
Well, I actually like to
vacuum, so I can still do it.

10:16.594 --> 10:19.162
Oh, don't make Vicki laugh.

10:19.163 --> 10:21.196
She can, you know.

10:25.001 --> 10:27.637
Well, since you did all of the cleaning,

10:27.638 --> 10:29.479
the least I could do is
make us breakfast, hmm?

10:29.480 --> 10:30.880
Oh, actually, there's no need.

10:33.978 --> 10:37.614
I already made eggs
Benedict and cucumber scones.

10:37.615 --> 10:39.883
Where are the-the pots
and the pans and the...?

10:39.884 --> 10:41.885
- Oh, I clean as I cook.
- Oh.

10:41.886 --> 10:43.386
Now, please sit.

10:43.387 --> 10:45.889
- Well, at least let me help you...
- No, I'll get it. Sit.

10:45.890 --> 10:47.190
Well, we still need the, uh...

10:47.191 --> 10:48.425
- Truffle salt?
- Yeah.

10:48.426 --> 10:49.826
I'll get it. Sit.

10:49.827 --> 10:50.994
Oh.

10:50.995 --> 10:54.331
Okay.

10:54.332 --> 10:57.534
Since you have done... everything,

10:57.535 --> 10:59.636
I guess I will just, uh...

10:59.637 --> 11:02.639
sit.

11:06.943 --> 11:08.945
What are you looking at?

11:08.946 --> 11:12.081
Obstacle.

11:22.359 --> 11:24.961
Oh, my God.

11:24.962 --> 11:26.529
Did somebody break in and cater?

11:26.530 --> 11:29.065
Oh, that?

11:29.066 --> 11:30.467
That's just dinner.

11:30.468 --> 11:32.369
That I made...

11:32.370 --> 11:34.370
with a stove!

11:35.572 --> 11:37.540
I figured since Evan is at his dad's,

11:37.541 --> 11:39.376
maybe we could have a romantic night.

11:39.377 --> 11:41.077
Well, we're off to a great start.

11:41.078 --> 11:42.779
I'm loving those napkins.

11:42.780 --> 11:44.414
I didn't think you knew about napkins.

11:44.415 --> 11:46.883
Well, that was a happy accident.

11:46.884 --> 11:49.319
I found them when I was looking
for the fire extinguisher.

11:49.320 --> 11:51.187
- Fire extinguisher?
- Yeah.

11:51.188 --> 11:53.290
That was an unhappy accident.

11:53.291 --> 11:55.624
Oh, no, no, don't go in the kitchen!

11:57.193 --> 11:59.195
Oscar, what happened to my kitchen?

11:59.196 --> 12:01.665
Uh-uh. Our kitchen.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.068
Our kitchen is a wreck.

12:05.069 --> 12:07.671
How did you get marinara
sauce on the ceiling?

12:07.672 --> 12:10.907
Oh, yeah, that. Well, the
first meal had an Italian theme.

12:10.908 --> 12:12.975
Big-a mistake-a.

12:14.444 --> 12:17.847
So then I did a fish fry
which turned into a fish fire.

12:17.848 --> 12:19.683
Why is the popcorn maker out?

12:19.684 --> 12:21.885
I had to watch a movie
while the smoke cleared.

12:21.886 --> 12:24.821
Oh, my God, Oscar.

12:24.822 --> 12:27.223
Okay, I know you mean
well, but in the last week,

12:27.224 --> 12:30.093
you have destroyed my
kitchen, you shrunk my clothes,

12:30.094 --> 12:31.695
and you stained my rug.

12:31.696 --> 12:34.997
I think you are minimizing
the napkin triumph.

12:36.132 --> 12:37.867
I'll go clean the kitchen.

12:37.868 --> 12:40.012
No, no, no, no, I'll do it.
You'll just make it worse.

12:40.013 --> 12:42.193
- What? No. I can do it.
- No, I can handle it, Evan.

12:44.741 --> 12:47.143
Well, that was... shriveling.

12:48.546 --> 12:50.547
I'm sorry. Just cleaning up your messes

12:50.548 --> 12:52.182
makes me feel like your mom.

12:52.183 --> 12:53.750
Ugh. That's not good.

12:53.751 --> 12:55.952
What is happening to us?

12:55.953 --> 12:58.554
I know. We had so my fun
while we were on vacation.

12:58.555 --> 12:59.389
Yeah.

12:59.390 --> 13:01.725
'Cause all we had to do was have fun.

13:01.726 --> 13:04.894
We had maids and waiters
to take care of us.

13:04.895 --> 13:06.830
Did we ruin something that was working

13:06.831 --> 13:08.465
by moving in together too soon?

13:08.466 --> 13:10.866
Maybe.

13:11.835 --> 13:13.503
I mean, when we weren't living together,

13:13.504 --> 13:17.006
we were just enjoying the
fun parts of a relationship.

13:17.007 --> 13:20.610
Maybe we should... go back to that.

13:20.611 --> 13:22.746
What are you saying?

13:22.747 --> 13:26.015
I'm saying we stay
together, but I move out?

13:26.016 --> 13:28.584
I like the sound of that.

13:29.586 --> 13:31.821
Say it again.

13:31.822 --> 13:33.490
I'm moving out.

13:33.491 --> 13:35.492
Oh.

13:35.493 --> 13:36.826
Keep going.

13:36.827 --> 13:39.429
I'm not going to live here anymore.

13:39.430 --> 13:40.764
That's it.

13:40.765 --> 13:42.365
Felix, here I come.

13:42.366 --> 13:44.700
- No. No.
- Yeah, I knew the minute I said that.

13:52.084 --> 13:53.817
Ooh, the next course.

13:53.818 --> 13:56.147
Teddy, I know you're a bratwurst fan.

13:56.148 --> 13:59.183
Somebody's been on my Pinterest page.

13:59.184 --> 14:00.818
And, Dani, you've been complaining

14:00.819 --> 14:02.286
about dry skin, so... Yeah.

14:02.287 --> 14:05.256
I whipped you up a lotion
of rose hips and Shea butter.

14:05.257 --> 14:07.825
Your hands will thank me.

14:07.826 --> 14:09.426
Oh.

14:09.427 --> 14:11.629
Thank you, Felix.

14:11.630 --> 14:13.397
My pleasure.

14:13.398 --> 14:14.698
Felix, is all this pampering

14:14.699 --> 14:17.001
because you don't have Oscar
to take care of anymore?

14:17.002 --> 14:19.225
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

14:19.226 --> 14:20.104
- Oh.
- Teddy,

14:20.105 --> 14:21.505
don't move!

14:21.506 --> 14:23.473
You're more lint than man right now.

14:24.508 --> 14:25.676
What?

14:27.712 --> 14:29.513
That tickles.

14:30.916 --> 14:32.082
I didn't say stop.

14:32.083 --> 14:35.819
Oh, right there, right there.

14:35.820 --> 14:37.587
- There.
- Hey, guys.

14:38.722 --> 14:42.193
Oh. I see you're
lint-rolling Teddy now.

14:42.194 --> 14:44.361
Oscar,

14:44.362 --> 14:46.664
your show starts in two
minutes. Come on, Teddy.

14:46.665 --> 14:48.831
Mm-hmm.

14:49.967 --> 14:52.069
So the new roommate is
working out great, then?

14:52.070 --> 14:54.971
Oh, he is, um, really something.

14:56.387 --> 14:57.908
How's everything up in your love nest?

14:57.909 --> 15:00.711
- Oh, so much love.
- Mm.

15:00.712 --> 15:02.479
Great. I'm happy for you.

15:02.480 --> 15:04.143
Not as happy as I am for you.

15:04.144 --> 15:06.584
Looks like this, uh, move
worked out for both of us.

15:06.585 --> 15:08.986
Absolutely.

15:08.987 --> 15:10.788
Oscar, there's a...
there's a little hint

15:10.789 --> 15:12.523
of, uh, lint on your shirt there.

15:12.524 --> 15:14.691
Oh.

15:18.829 --> 15:21.532
- I don't know how this thing works.
- Stop. Stop. It's more of a...

15:21.533 --> 15:23.067
It's more of a sweeping motion.

15:23.068 --> 15:25.034
It's a lint roller, not a lint dagger.

15:25.903 --> 15:28.539
Can you... help me?

15:28.540 --> 15:30.341
Do you want me to help you?

15:30.342 --> 15:33.377
I do want you to help me.

15:33.378 --> 15:36.380
Oh, thank God. I miss
doing things for you!

15:36.381 --> 15:38.616
And I miss doing nothing!

15:38.617 --> 15:40.117
I want you to move back in!

15:40.118 --> 15:42.719
- I want to move back in, too!
- Oh!

15:45.523 --> 15:48.391
Damn it! Neil's home.

15:50.628 --> 15:53.130
Vicki. Felix.

15:53.131 --> 15:56.366
- Neil.
- Armstrong.

15:58.902 --> 16:01.086
Neil, I have a request,

16:01.087 --> 16:03.656
and I'm going to make it
as efficient as possible.

16:03.657 --> 16:05.891
- Leave.
- What?

16:05.892 --> 16:08.260
Pack your things.
Oscar's moving back in.

16:08.261 --> 16:11.397
Oh. The lease I signed
legally entitles me

16:11.398 --> 16:12.965
to stay here for one year.

16:12.966 --> 16:14.166
And why would I leave

16:14.167 --> 16:15.550
when this apartment is equidistant

16:15.551 --> 16:16.869
from my work, my parents

16:16.870 --> 16:19.137
and the woman destined
to become my lover?

16:21.874 --> 16:23.608
I'm not going anywhere.

16:25.110 --> 16:27.278
Vicki, come!

16:31.517 --> 16:33.285
What are we gonna do?

16:33.286 --> 16:37.890
We need to convince Neil
Armstrong to take one small step

16:37.891 --> 16:40.893
out of our apartment and...

16:40.894 --> 16:43.995
Just keep walking.

16:45.130 --> 16:48.367
Wow. You... you really
don't know your history.

16:48.368 --> 16:49.700
No, no.

16:52.471 --> 16:55.207
Oh, sorry, Neil.

16:55.208 --> 16:56.475
Elevator's out.

16:56.476 --> 16:59.044
- Just so inefficient.
- Hmm.

16:59.045 --> 17:01.080
Well, not for me.

17:01.081 --> 17:03.215
Taking the stairs will
count as my workout.

17:03.216 --> 17:05.550
I just saved an hour a day.

17:22.568 --> 17:25.170
Oh. Sorry, Neil.

17:25.171 --> 17:26.505
I should have warned you.

17:26.506 --> 17:28.540
My Kronos Quartet cover band meets here

17:28.540 --> 17:32.077
thrice weekly for midnight rehearsals.

17:32.078 --> 17:34.079
Aha.

17:34.080 --> 17:37.515
A little "Nocturne" in the nocturne.

17:38.917 --> 17:40.552
He knew the name of the piece

17:40.553 --> 17:43.521
and revealed it in a clever
way. This is not good!

17:47.092 --> 17:49.193
Shall we take it from the top?

17:54.733 --> 17:57.335
Damn it, we sound sublime!

18:02.274 --> 18:04.643
Namaste, Neil!

18:04.644 --> 18:06.211
Oh.

18:06.212 --> 18:08.046
So steamy. Hot yoga!

18:09.516 --> 18:11.115
My butt crack's like Splash Mountain.

18:15.320 --> 18:18.356
And I'm going to move away from Teddy.

18:19.658 --> 18:22.361
I'm actually certified
in Jivamukti Yoga,

18:22.362 --> 18:24.229
and you're doing everything

18:24.230 --> 18:25.898
wrong.

18:25.899 --> 18:28.599
Let me go jump into my Lululemons.

18:29.535 --> 18:32.104
Aah. It's hopeless.

18:32.105 --> 18:33.939
- Nothing's worked.
- Yeah.

18:33.940 --> 18:36.575
We should turn the heat off
before Mr. Novak complains.

18:36.576 --> 18:38.911
Oh, he moved out two weeks ago.

18:38.912 --> 18:40.512
Which means that apartment's empty.

18:40.513 --> 18:45.116
You mean we could kill Neil
and put his body parts up there?

18:46.685 --> 18:50.222
Or we get Neil to take that apartment.

18:50.223 --> 18:51.356
Oh, yeah, let's try that.

18:51.357 --> 18:53.192
Yes, that's better, that's better.

18:53.193 --> 18:55.460
Neil,

18:55.461 --> 18:57.629
this place would be perfect for you!

18:57.630 --> 18:58.931
It's the same layout

18:58.932 --> 19:00.933
with an even better view!

19:00.934 --> 19:02.501
I don't know.

19:02.502 --> 19:04.303
Seven extra seconds on the elevator

19:04.304 --> 19:06.505
times two round trips a day over a year

19:06.506 --> 19:09.274
equals just over 2.83 hours wasted.

19:09.275 --> 19:11.710
Hmm.

19:11.711 --> 19:13.278
Well, I've made my decision.

19:13.279 --> 19:15.480
Any chance it's a yes?

19:15.481 --> 19:17.581
Your simplicity is childlike.

19:21.286 --> 19:22.921
Well, it looks like I'm stuck with him.

19:22.922 --> 19:25.016
I don't even want to go
back down to the apartment.

19:25.017 --> 19:27.258
Yeah, I understand. I can't
go back to Charlotte's place.

19:27.259 --> 19:28.882
She's having the whole
kitchen repainted.

19:28.883 --> 19:30.131
Oh, God, did you cook?

19:32.957 --> 19:34.892
Want to just hang out here for a while?

19:34.893 --> 19:37.094
- Sure.
- Hmm.

19:40.965 --> 19:43.668
- Wish I had all my TVs up here.
- Mm.

19:43.669 --> 19:45.670
These buckets aren't
exactly posterior friendly.

19:45.671 --> 19:47.471
I wish we had our couch.

19:49.440 --> 19:51.109
Coffee table could go right here.

19:51.110 --> 19:52.677
I could throw my socks

19:52.678 --> 19:55.078
right over there.

19:56.214 --> 19:57.482
We'd be roommates!

19:57.483 --> 19:59.417
Again!

19:59.418 --> 20:01.177
So much hugging.

20:01.178 --> 20:03.038
Yeah, that's enough
hugging for a whole year.

20:08.733 --> 20:11.667
And that completes the
tour. What do you think?

20:13.290 --> 20:15.159
It's the same damn apartment!

20:15.160 --> 20:17.495
No, it is not.

20:17.496 --> 20:19.864
The stain on the old
floors was maple cherry.

20:19.865 --> 20:21.565
And these floors are...?

20:21.566 --> 20:24.335
Oak toffee! Open your eyes, people!

20:24.336 --> 20:26.017
I'm just glad you guys
are roommates again.

20:26.018 --> 20:27.401
Now we have someplace to hang out.

20:27.402 --> 20:28.773
I've tried their place.

20:28.774 --> 20:30.540
Too many smelly candles.

20:31.475 --> 20:34.211
You ladies have a problem.

20:34.212 --> 20:35.846
Well, you're always welcome up here.

20:35.847 --> 20:37.481
Consider this your home away from home.

20:40.686 --> 20:42.019
Felix, what the hell?

20:42.020 --> 20:44.755
Ah, sorry. It's the higher altitude.

20:44.756 --> 20:47.558
It's 18 feet higher.

20:47.559 --> 20:49.727
Well, tell that to my sinuses.

20:49.728 --> 20:52.362
It's 18 feet higher!

20:53.364 --> 20:55.466
Okay, even with my impaired nose,

20:55.467 --> 20:57.868
I can tell that you have
not unpacked your toothbrush.

20:57.869 --> 21:01.538
And I can tell that you have not
unpacked the stick up your butt!

21:03.038 --> 21:06.060
They're back, ladies and gentlemen!
