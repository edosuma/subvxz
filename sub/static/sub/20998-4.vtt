09:18.005 --> 09:19.292
You're okay.

09:19.640 --> 09:21.573
[Laughter]

09:21.575 --> 09:23.876
We were drunker than two crabs
at a fish fry.

09:23.878 --> 09:25.344
- Polly: Uh-huh.
- [Laughs]

09:25.346 --> 09:26.378
Yeah.

09:26.380 --> 09:28.247
Oh, then we met those two fellas.

09:28.249 --> 09:29.448
Identical twins.

09:29.450 --> 09:31.617
Ooh, I love me some twins.

09:31.619 --> 09:35.521
Mmm. Before we knew it, we were
headed back to the hotel.

09:35.523 --> 09:38.457
Two more martinis later,
I passed out and then woke up

09:38.459 --> 09:41.193
to Heather screaming
in the room next door.

09:41.195 --> 09:43.095
Ooh, girl, he tried to
rape you, didn't he?

09:43.097 --> 09:44.329
Not quite.

09:44.331 --> 09:46.598
I busted down the door
and found Miss Thing

09:46.600 --> 09:49.735
yelling about his micropenis.

09:49.737 --> 09:50.936
[Laughter]

09:50.938 --> 09:52.337
Oh, that's worse.

09:52.339 --> 09:54.773
It was so small, y'all.

09:54.775 --> 09:56.808
I mean, it was about
the size of this polish.

09:56.810 --> 09:58.143
[Laughter]

09:58.145 --> 09:59.611
What color is that?

09:59.613 --> 10:01.113
Uh, "carrot."

10:01.115 --> 10:03.048
"Baby carrot" is more like it.

10:03.050 --> 10:05.117
Oh, Heather!

10:05.119 --> 10:07.819
[Laughter]

10:07.821 --> 10:09.755
[Tapping on glass]

10:09.757 --> 10:11.886
Can you hold on just a second?

10:12.293 --> 10:14.293
Come on, baby, get out the car.

10:17.765 --> 10:19.164
Jennifer: Girl.

10:19.166 --> 10:21.300
Polly's in there conning some rich Betty

10:21.302 --> 10:22.534
who calls her "Heather."

10:22.536 --> 10:24.336
- She at it again, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

10:24.338 --> 10:26.972
Come on, Dean. Get out the car.

10:26.974 --> 10:29.274
Dean? Come on, honey.

10:29.276 --> 10:32.211
Hey, Jenn, your customer said
she's got to get back to work.

10:32.213 --> 10:34.146
Okay.

10:34.148 --> 10:36.515
[Speaking Vietnamese]

10:38.185 --> 10:39.418
[Speaking Vietnamese]

10:39.420 --> 10:41.286
Unh-unh, cut that shit out.

10:41.288 --> 10:42.888
Take him inside, please.

10:42.890 --> 10:44.323
Okay.

10:46.927 --> 10:48.126
What's with the get-up?

10:48.128 --> 10:49.595
He had training today.

10:49.597 --> 10:52.331
I had to cancel it 'cause he saw
our old foster parents.

10:52.333 --> 10:53.732
Which ones?

10:53.734 --> 10:54.933
The bad ones.

10:54.935 --> 10:57.603
The ones that made you
eat out of dog bowls?

10:57.605 --> 11:00.606
These people treated us like animals.

11:00.608 --> 11:02.507
Listen, Uncle Daddy's on the warpath.

11:02.509 --> 11:04.910
Can you keep an eye on him
while I run down to the clinic?

11:04.912 --> 11:06.812
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

11:06.814 --> 11:09.615
I'll make sure china doll
doesn't fall on his dick.

11:09.617 --> 11:10.916
That part.

11:12.720 --> 11:15.654
Dr. Ken: Look at this guy.
My ex-wife is marrying <i> him.</i>

11:15.656 --> 11:17.256
He's got such a weak underbite.

11:17.258 --> 11:18.523
Forget about eating hard cheeses.

11:18.525 --> 11:20.325
Shelly loves hard cheeses.

11:20.327 --> 11:21.893
People are allowed to move on.

11:21.895 --> 11:24.696
Ugh. don't give me that
Tony Robbins crap.

11:24.698 --> 11:28.533
Shelly is the only Jewish girl
I ever found who was freaky.

11:29.720 --> 11:31.169
What... What kind of freaky?

11:31.171 --> 11:32.437
Cupping freaky.

11:32.439 --> 11:33.872
S&M kind of freaky.

11:33.874 --> 11:35.507
I can't even come with anyone else.

11:35.509 --> 11:36.475
Okay.

11:37.678 --> 11:41.079
You guys, we need to increase
the foot traffic down here

11:41.081 --> 11:42.414
so we can pay Uncle Daddy back.

11:42.416 --> 11:44.116
Yeah, he already told us
about the payment plan.

11:44.118 --> 11:46.918
Okay, no offense,
but I can't be that man's bitch

11:46.920 --> 11:48.220
for another year.

11:48.222 --> 11:50.555
So, I want to sell
ten times more inventory

11:50.557 --> 11:52.457
at a slightly higher price.

11:52.459 --> 11:55.482
It's not possible. The feds would be
all over us. We'd go to jail.

11:55.484 --> 11:56.828
Not if we buy from multiple wholesalers.

11:56.830 --> 11:57.996
We spread the love.

11:57.998 --> 12:00.198
Doesn't that go against
everything you taught me?

12:00.200 --> 12:02.434
So does letting the delivery guy rob us.

12:02.436 --> 12:04.503
Dr. Ken's the one who told me
to let the courier in.

12:04.505 --> 12:05.737
Not in the stock room!

12:05.739 --> 12:08.307
- You didn't specify!
- Shut up!

12:09.576 --> 12:11.310
Look, we don't have enough customers

12:11.312 --> 12:12.778
to sell this much product.

12:12.780 --> 12:14.546
Well, how does Peter Pain do it?

12:14.548 --> 12:16.815
They shell out big bucks for
marketing tools and publicity.

12:16.817 --> 12:18.350
We don't have that kind of ground game.

12:18.352 --> 12:19.918
Okay, so, we'll construct one.

12:19.920 --> 12:21.386
I'll rally the troops.

12:21.388 --> 12:24.156
Wait, wait, wait. We would need
$20,000 to order what we needed.

12:24.158 --> 12:25.657
I don't have that. Do you?

12:28.729 --> 12:30.195
Where'd you get this from?

12:30.197 --> 12:31.396
My trust fund.

12:31.398 --> 12:32.964
Order the damn pills.

12:36.303 --> 12:38.904
Roller: One one-thousand,
two one-thousand,

12:38.906 --> 12:42.207
three one-thousand, four one-thousand,

12:42.209 --> 12:44.142
five one-thousand.

12:44.144 --> 12:46.311
That's my money, baby girl.

12:46.313 --> 12:47.913
Not today, Roller.

12:51.585 --> 12:55.120
Okay, so, tomorrow, two sets,

12:55.122 --> 12:56.521
Breezewoods Country Club.

12:56.523 --> 12:59.791
Oh, that is where Otto and I
went on our third date,

12:59.793 --> 13:01.724
when he got me that huge diamond.

13:01.726 --> 13:02.637
Yes.

13:02.639 --> 13:05.230
Yeah, but when he found out
that it was a blood diamond

13:05.232 --> 13:08.367
and a little kid's fingers
were cut off in order to get it,

13:08.369 --> 13:09.868
he hawked it,

13:09.870 --> 13:14.306
and he sent the money back
to Africa to build an orphanage.

13:14.308 --> 13:17.075
He named it "Heathers."

13:17.077 --> 13:19.144
He was such a good man.

13:19.146 --> 13:20.345
I will see you tomorrow.

13:20.347 --> 13:21.613
So good to see you.

13:21.615 --> 13:23.014
So good to see you.

13:23.016 --> 13:24.449
[Bells ding]

13:27.354 --> 13:29.888
An African orphanage?

13:29.890 --> 13:30.922
Are you kidding me?

13:30.924 --> 13:33.158
Do not backslide, Polly-Pol.

13:33.160 --> 13:34.526
- Desna...
- No, no, no.

13:34.528 --> 13:36.328
I thought you said you were
cleaning up your life.

13:36.330 --> 13:37.796
I am.

13:37.798 --> 13:40.332
Re-entry into society
is a complicated process.

13:40.334 --> 13:41.833
Okay, well, un-complicate it.

13:41.835 --> 13:43.869
- Okay.
- I don't need the cops coming around.

13:43.871 --> 13:46.471
I still got PTSD from your last arrest.

13:46.473 --> 13:48.407
It's just a friendly game of tennis.

13:48.409 --> 13:49.388
Mm-hmm.

13:49.390 --> 13:51.810
How you think that ankle jewelry
is gonna fit in

13:51.812 --> 13:54.613
at the country club, Heather?

13:54.615 --> 13:56.648
You didn't think about that, did you?

13:58.919 --> 14:02.020
All right, y'all know that
the clinic got robbed.

14:02.022 --> 14:05.590
We need to come up with a way to
increase the foot traffic there.

14:05.592 --> 14:09.127
I want ideas that don't cost
more than a set of gels.

14:09.129 --> 14:11.329
- Go.
- Oh, I know.

14:11.331 --> 14:12.898
Incentives.

14:12.900 --> 14:15.834
When I was running for head
of my sorority, Chi Omega,

14:15.836 --> 14:17.969
I gave out Rice Krispie Treats

14:17.971 --> 14:19.971
to everyone who pledged to vote for me.

14:19.973 --> 14:21.373
Ooh, ooh, I got one.

14:21.375 --> 14:23.041
Okay, when it was slow at She She's,

14:23.043 --> 14:25.210
Uncle Daddy would have
a rubber-glove day.

14:25.212 --> 14:27.646
What do you do with rubber
gloves at a strip club?

14:27.648 --> 14:30.182
Rubber gloves can cut down
on E. coli contamination.

14:30.184 --> 14:32.851
Or we can just go to Peter Pain
and steal their clients.

14:32.853 --> 14:35.787
No. I don't want to start a war.

14:35.789 --> 14:36.788
Hmm.

14:36.790 --> 14:38.223
Come on, y'all, think.

14:38.225 --> 14:39.958
Oh. When I was in high school,

14:39.960 --> 14:41.726
I had to raise money for an abortion.

14:41.728 --> 14:44.596
So, I wore a bikini and stood
outside a car wash with a sign.

14:44.598 --> 14:46.498
Asking for an abortion?

14:46.500 --> 14:49.000
Promoting the car wash.

14:49.002 --> 14:50.402
I raised enough for two.

14:50.404 --> 14:51.703
Car washes?

14:51.705 --> 14:54.206
Abortions. Dang, keep up.

14:54.208 --> 14:56.641
O-kay. Let's recap.

14:56.643 --> 14:58.343
- We got a bake sale.
- Yeah.

14:58.345 --> 14:59.644
Finger banging,

14:59.646 --> 15:02.481
standing outside
in a bikini holding signs.

15:02.483 --> 15:03.682
Ding, ding, ding.

15:03.684 --> 15:05.083
We got our winner, ladies.

15:05.085 --> 15:06.518
- Bake sale.
- That's right, that's right.

15:06.520 --> 15:08.086
Bust out your bikinis.

15:08.088 --> 15:09.488
Desna, that's not fair.

15:09.490 --> 15:11.156
I'm not bikini-ready.

15:11.158 --> 15:13.358
Y'all don't even know what it's
like to try to lose baby weight.

15:13.360 --> 15:14.693
Girl, are you still on that?

15:14.695 --> 15:16.261
Your baby is 4!

15:16.263 --> 15:17.462
[Laughter]

15:17.464 --> 15:19.865
Stop it. That's hurtful.

15:19.867 --> 15:21.299
Oh, you know what? No, no, no.

15:21.301 --> 15:23.301
Why don't we just wear the, um,

15:23.303 --> 15:27.205
our Vanity 6 costumes
that we wore at the karaoke jam.

15:27.207 --> 15:28.440
I know you like that.

15:28.442 --> 15:29.841
We need to look sexy out there.

15:29.843 --> 15:32.711
Wait, wait, wait, hold up.
Who is Vanity 6?

15:32.713 --> 15:35.547
- Oh.
- I cannot with you right now.

15:35.549 --> 15:37.215
- I've never heard of that.
- Okay, all right.

15:37.217 --> 15:40.552
Sugar, Sugar, there used to be
an artist formerly known as...

15:40.554 --> 15:42.187
All: Prince.

15:42.189 --> 15:46.091
Right. And he had a girl band
formerly known as Vanity 6.

15:46.093 --> 15:50.228
This was at a time formerly
known as the Goddamn '80s!

15:50.230 --> 15:52.397
- Tell her, Polly!
- Right?

15:52.399 --> 15:54.299
Get it, Pol. Get it, Pol.

15:54.301 --> 15:55.600
Get it, Pol.

15:55.602 --> 15:58.570
This is my... This is Molly Ringwald.

15:58.572 --> 16:00.238
Uncle Daddy: Virginia!

16:01.360 --> 16:03.808
I need your services outside.

16:04.155 --> 16:05.377
Mine?

16:05.379 --> 16:06.782
What's going on, Bryce?

16:07.281 --> 16:08.784
Outside.

16:09.416 --> 16:10.982
Don't make me repeat myself.

16:10.984 --> 16:12.217
It don't go well.

16:13.420 --> 16:14.986
Okay.

16:14.988 --> 16:16.621
Desna: Go, go, go. Come on.

16:18.225 --> 16:19.424
Dean, don't move.

16:19.426 --> 16:20.859
I'll stay here.

16:40.147 --> 16:41.580
Get out.

16:44.818 --> 16:46.251
What you waiting for?

16:48.889 --> 16:51.056
- Who is it?
- I don't... I don't know.

16:52.859 --> 16:55.393
Is this one of the assholes
that killed my baby boy?

16:55.395 --> 16:56.628
[Grunts]

16:56.630 --> 16:57.896
I-I don't know.

16:57.898 --> 16:59.331
Well, he works for Titus Industries,

16:59.333 --> 17:00.899
and he had a beef with Roller.

17:00.901 --> 17:03.501
That was two years ago, over an invoice.

17:03.503 --> 17:04.935
Shut up!

17:05.839 --> 17:07.839
You want some peanut butter? Huh?

17:07.840 --> 17:11.076
You want some peanut butter,
you sicky, freaky boy?

17:11.078 --> 17:12.143
Oink, oink!

17:12.145 --> 17:14.279
I-I never saw him. I only heard him.

17:14.281 --> 17:15.914
Clay, please.

17:17.250 --> 17:20.117
Say something, you mongoloid rug rat,

17:20.119 --> 17:22.554
with your Goddamn O.J. shoes.

17:22.556 --> 17:24.756
I didn't do it, please.

17:24.758 --> 17:25.957
Ask him his name.

17:25.959 --> 17:27.826
What's your name, sir?

17:27.828 --> 17:29.407
Mitchell Wilks.

17:29.930 --> 17:31.763
No, no, no. It doesn't sound like him.

17:31.765 --> 17:33.531
Ask him another one.

17:33.533 --> 17:35.204
Uh...

17:36.637 --> 17:39.270
Uh, where... where do you live?

17:39.272 --> 17:41.139
210 Grove Street.

17:41.141 --> 17:42.540
I used to live near there.

17:42.542 --> 17:43.975
Shh.

17:45.846 --> 17:48.980
- [Whimpering]
- Shh!

17:49.468 --> 17:52.471
This the son of a bitch
who killed my baby boy?

17:52.919 --> 17:55.320
You kill my baby boy?

17:55.322 --> 17:56.921
Hmm?

17:56.923 --> 17:58.323
Desna: Please, Clay.

17:58.325 --> 18:00.959
Is this the son of a bitch
who killed my boy?

18:00.961 --> 18:02.193
I don't think so, Uncle Daddy.

18:02.195 --> 18:03.561
I-I don't think that's him.

18:03.563 --> 18:05.830
No, no, no. It's not him. No.

18:05.832 --> 18:07.766
- [Screaming]
- Clay, please!

18:12.873 --> 18:14.939
You said Titus.

18:14.941 --> 18:16.241
He works for Titus.

18:16.243 --> 18:17.842
- It wasn't...
- It wasn't him.

18:17.844 --> 18:21.246
It wasn't him. I swear...
I swear, he didn't do it.

18:21.248 --> 18:22.614
You lying to me?

18:22.616 --> 18:24.816
Mnh-mnh. No.

Desna: Hey, girl.

41:31.066 --> 41:33.166
Hey, girl. Ooh, I love those nails.

41:33.168 --> 41:36.736
Thanks. Is, uh, Uncle Daddy in the back?

41:36.738 --> 41:38.138
He's gonna want this.

41:38.140 --> 41:41.232
No. He actually just left
to go meet Bryce.

41:41.983 --> 41:43.677
I'm not supposed to tell anybody this,

41:43.679 --> 41:47.614
but you have the right to know,
being Roller's girl and all.

41:47.616 --> 41:49.849
Bryce figured out who killed Roller.

41:52.120 --> 41:54.187
Seriously? Who?

41:54.189 --> 41:55.655
Well, I mean, I don't know,

41:55.657 --> 42:01.161
but when they find him,
they're gonna kill him.

42:12.058 --> 42:16.493
[Indistinct conversations, laughter]

42:16.495 --> 42:19.196
Oh, damn. Don't tell me
Uncle Daddy charged interest.

42:19.198 --> 42:21.865
He wasn't there, but Bryce
knows who killed Roller

42:21.867 --> 42:23.400
and he's out looking for him.

42:23.402 --> 42:25.069
Oh, no, ma'am, no, ma'am.

42:25.071 --> 42:26.470
Hold up. Do they know who did it?

42:26.472 --> 42:27.971
Toby didn't say.

42:29.308 --> 42:30.674
He's not answering.

42:30.676 --> 42:32.943
Okay, y'all take Jenn home
in case he comes there.

42:32.945 --> 42:35.979
You stay with me in case they come back.

42:35.981 --> 42:37.577
- Shit.
- Go baby.

42:39.952 --> 42:40.951
[Sighs]

42:40.953 --> 42:42.353
What if they think it was us?

42:42.355 --> 42:43.836
We got to get out of here.

42:44.743 --> 42:45.976
Come on.

42:48.127 --> 42:50.260
God, finally. Where the hell are you?

42:50.262 --> 42:51.495
Dr. Ken murdered Roller,

42:51.497 --> 42:53.030
and Uncle Daddy wants me to kill him.

42:53.032 --> 42:54.098
Dr. Ken?

42:54.100 --> 42:55.999
Have you been watching "Scarface" again?

42:56.001 --> 42:57.801
He has a gun in his safe...

42:57.803 --> 42:59.870
the same kind of gun
that shot up my brother's place.

42:59.872 --> 43:02.406
Honey, he mourned for a month
about his dead dog.

43:02.408 --> 43:03.774
He is not a killer.

43:03.776 --> 43:05.843
He also knew that Roller
used the same password

43:05.845 --> 43:07.644
- for everything.
- This is not rational.

43:07.646 --> 43:09.313
You sound insane.

43:09.315 --> 43:11.849
Um, I think you're trying to
prove something to Uncle Daddy.

43:11.851 --> 43:14.218
No, I'm helping my brother!

43:16.222 --> 43:18.789
I do this, and I'm done, all right?

43:18.791 --> 43:20.491
This gets me out, babe. Trust me.

43:20.493 --> 43:21.925
No, no.

43:22.628 --> 43:24.461
[Screams]

43:24.463 --> 43:27.464
Dean. Dean, I need you
to go and pack a bag.

43:27.466 --> 43:28.665
We're going to a hotel, okay?

43:28.667 --> 43:30.134
Wait. W-Why?

43:30.136 --> 43:32.236
For a staycation. Just go do it.

43:32.238 --> 43:33.437
Hi, Virginia.

43:33.439 --> 43:35.205
- Hi, Dean.
- Uh...

43:35.207 --> 43:36.907
can I at least stay in Virginia's room?

43:36.909 --> 43:40.010
- No, Dean.
- Hey, sugar dumpling.

43:40.012 --> 43:43.113
I think you'd best tell
the truth, don't you, boo?

43:43.115 --> 43:45.849
Bryce didn't buy that
credit-card bullshit.

43:48.347 --> 43:49.546
Mm.

43:49.571 --> 43:51.987
God damn, you're beautiful.

43:53.159 --> 43:55.058
I'll be seeing you soon.

43:57.897 --> 44:00.597
Dean: 85% of hotels have bedbugs.

44:00.599 --> 44:04.334
Go pack the bag, baby, please!

44:04.336 --> 44:05.736
Please!

44:05.738 --> 44:07.704
[Cellphone rings]

44:07.706 --> 44:09.706
- Did you find him?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

44:09.708 --> 44:11.875
Uh, Bryce thinks
that Dr. Ken killed Roller

44:11.877 --> 44:13.310
and he's going after him.

44:13.312 --> 44:14.545
What?

44:14.547 --> 44:17.014
Bryce thinks Dr. Ken killed Roller.

44:17.016 --> 44:18.715
Kenneth had nothing to do with this.

44:18.717 --> 44:20.317
Yeah, I know.

44:20.319 --> 44:23.487
Okay. You keep trying to find
Bryce, and I'll find Ken.

44:23.489 --> 44:24.988
Shit.

44:26.292 --> 44:28.659
[Ringing]

44:28.661 --> 44:30.093
Don't try and stop me, Desna.

44:30.095 --> 44:31.495
I made up my mind. I love her.

44:31.497 --> 44:33.197
<i>Ken, listen to me.</i>

44:33.199 --> 44:34.690
He-Hello?

44:34.692 --> 44:36.099
Damn it.

44:36.101 --> 44:37.534
I got to get to that engagement party.

44:37.536 --> 44:38.769
Move, move.

44:38.771 --> 44:40.103
Desna, what do you want me to do?

44:40.105 --> 44:41.738
Watch him, Virginia.

44:41.740 --> 44:43.173
[Sighs]

44:46.011 --> 44:49.837
When I first met Shelly, we were
with Habitat for Humanity,

44:50.216 --> 44:52.840
building a house
for the underprivileged.

44:53.486 --> 44:55.018
And when I saw her next,

44:55.020 --> 44:58.095
I'd just finished a triathlon
with a sprained ankle.

44:59.225 --> 45:01.792
But Shelly still let me buy her a drink,

45:01.794 --> 45:05.362
and at that moment,
I knew she was special.

45:05.364 --> 45:07.831
[Laughing loudly]

45:10.536 --> 45:11.969
"Special"?

45:11.971 --> 45:13.971
If you thought she was special,

45:13.973 --> 45:17.207
why'd you take her bike-riding
while wearing a fanny pack?

45:17.209 --> 45:19.409
What dignified man does that?

45:19.411 --> 45:21.378
Ken, don't you do this.

45:21.380 --> 45:24.288
I'm... I'm trying to...
I'm trying to save you, Shelly.

45:24.850 --> 45:26.707
You're a loser and a fake.

45:27.186 --> 45:29.520
Huh? How could you give this up, Shelly?

45:29.522 --> 45:31.488
You don't want to live a life of
missionary boredom.

45:31.490 --> 45:34.077
