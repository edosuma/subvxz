(THEME SONG PLAYING)

01:27.033 --> 01:29.133
No, I've not given up the idea of going to university.

01:29.200 --> 01:30.801
It's not like I'm never gonna go.

01:30.868 --> 01:33.701
It's just that, um, I've been made senior sales rep,

01:33.767 --> 01:36.367
which is a great opportunity for me.

01:36.434 --> 01:38.534
There's people now coming in from Swindon,

01:38.601 --> 01:41.968
which is a new and exciting sort of venture for me as well.

01:42.167 --> 01:47.267
Um, I'm 30. Time to grow up, basically. It's that simple.

01:47.334 --> 01:50.534
Okay, listen, I suggest we put this down as a lesson, right?

01:50.601 --> 01:54.300
You have the stuff over to me by 3:00 today.

01:54.367 --> 01:58.601
3:00 today, please. All right? Then we'll say no harm done.

01:58.667 --> 02:01.300
-All right? Okay. See you. -(MOBILE PHONE RINGS)

02:02.100 --> 02:03.634
Gareth Keenan.

02:03.701 --> 02:05.400
Who's that?

02:05.467 --> 02:07.534
Oggy!

02:18.801 --> 02:19.934
(CHUCKLES)

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Yeah. I'll see you later.

02:24.601 --> 02:26.934
Do you still keep in touch with Oggy?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.667
-That was Oggy just then. -Was it? How is he?

02:29.734 --> 02:30.868
He's fine. You don't even know him.

02:30.934 --> 02:32.567
No, I wish I did. He sounds great.

02:32.634 --> 02:34.367
-He is, actually. -Hmm.

02:34.434 --> 02:35.934
One thing, Gareth. When you are on the phone,

02:36.000 --> 02:37.434
could you keep the pig impersonations down to a minimum?

02:37.500 --> 02:39.500
Yeah, here we go.

02:39.567 --> 02:42.801
I've told you before, you can't tell me what to do. I am team leader.

02:42.868 --> 02:45.801
Well, you see, Gareth, I'm senior sales rep, so yes, I can.

02:45.868 --> 02:47.901
Uh, team leader beats senior sales rep.

02:47.968 --> 02:51.000
No, no. No, it doesn't. My job title actually means something, Gareth. Yeah?

02:51.067 --> 02:53.200
Uh, I've got a pay rise. I'm on a new scale.

02:53.267 --> 02:54.467
Team leader don't mean anything, mate.

02:54.534 --> 02:56.100
Excuse me, it means I'm leader of a team.

02:56.167 --> 02:58.300
No, it doesn't mean. It's a title someone's

02:58.367 --> 03:02.567
to get you to do something they don't want to do for free. All right?

03:02.634 --> 03:05.934
It's like making a div kid at school milk monitor.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.901
-No one respects it. -I think they do.

03:07.968 --> 03:09.968
-No, they don't, Gareth. -Uh, yes, they do.

03:10.033 --> 03:11.934
'Cause if people were rude to me,

03:12.000 --> 03:14.734
you know, I used to give them their milk last. So that it was warm.

03:17.534 --> 03:18.834
All right?

03:40.534 --> 03:42.601
Oh, no.

03:42.667 --> 03:46.400
Going through some old stuff. Found the Inside Paper.

03:46.467 --> 03:49.467
It's a trade magazine for the paper industry.

03:49.534 --> 03:52.234
My ugly mug on the front. Oh, no.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.701
Embarrassing.

03:55.734 --> 03:56.968
All right.

04:00.334 --> 04:01.300
(SOFTLY) Oh.

04:06.968 --> 04:08.400
All right.

04:08.467 --> 04:10.500
He's put me off what I was doing. Where was I?

04:10.567 --> 04:13.868
Oh, yeah, looking at the phone calls.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.667
Don't, don't, don't, don't. Stop it.

04:20.734 --> 04:22.567
Give it.

04:22.634 --> 04:25.033
Hello? Dawn, uh, someone's coming to collect that later.

04:25.100 --> 04:26.601
-Okay. -So, if you can...

04:26.667 --> 04:28.601
Um, Lee, I wouldn't get caught behind there today, mate.

04:28.667 --> 04:30.500
'Cause there's new people coming in and top brass are milling about.

04:30.567 --> 04:32.500
-So, you should, uh... Yeah. -Go ahead.

04:32.567 --> 04:33.901
-I'm going anyway, mate. -All right.

04:33.968 --> 04:35.934
-See you. -Bye.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.934
All right, mate.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.701
Um, I'm sorry about that.

04:39.767 --> 04:41.334
It's just I've got to supervise everything

04:41.400 --> 04:43.801
and make sure it's all sorted, you know.

04:43.868 --> 04:46.901
-You haven't visited for ages. -Huh? Oh, yeah.

04:46.968 --> 04:50.367
Well, I'm busy now. I'm sort of, um, a bit snowed under, so...

04:50.434 --> 04:51.934
But you're all right, though?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
-Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. You? -Mmm. Did you just laugh?

04:54.067 --> 04:56.033
-(PHONE RINGS) -Oh, phone.

05:02.133 --> 05:03.968
Okay.

05:04.167 --> 05:06.267
I'll call you if I find anything. All right.

05:07.267 --> 05:09.901
Oh. It's all go.

05:09.968 --> 05:11.534
This is David. This is Neil.

05:11.601 --> 05:13.934
-Neil Godwin. Hiya. -Hi.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.167
Neil is Jennifer's replacement. He's sort of overseeing...

05:17.234 --> 05:18.500
David's boss.

05:18.567 --> 05:19.868
Just a tiny, a little bit above me, and that's it.

05:19.934 --> 05:21.500
I'm the UK manager.

05:21.701 --> 05:25.033
Um, I was sort of David's equivalent in Swindon.

05:25.100 --> 05:27.968
And, um, doing the same kind of job as him.

05:28.033 --> 05:29.467
Obviously, my branch closed

05:29.534 --> 05:32.167
-and now my staff are coming here. -Welcome.

05:32.234 --> 05:35.300
So I'm essentially David's boss, looking after him.

05:35.367 --> 05:38.434
"Looking after" is the wrong term to use, because we're both...

05:38.500 --> 05:40.000
But good to meet you though.

05:40.067 --> 05:42.234
-Um, we have met before. -Have we?

05:42.300 --> 05:44.534
-Yeah, Ipswich conference? -Oh, God.

05:44.601 --> 05:47.200
(IN FRENCH ACCENT) I was a little bit drunk.

05:47.267 --> 05:49.133
For most of the week, as I remember.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.734
Doesn't sound like me, does it, Dawn?

05:52.868 --> 05:55.400
Anyway, oh. Oh.

05:55.467 --> 05:56.934
Come into my boudoir.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.934
Ooh. Ah. Is Jennifer with you?

06:00.000 --> 06:03.267
-Uh, no, she's on her way, apparently. -Oh, part-timer.

06:07.634 --> 06:09.801
(IMITATING JOHNNY VEGAS) Monkey!

06:09.868 --> 06:13.934
Just an example of the laughs we have here, isn't it? For one.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.434
Sure, um, we're in potentially traumatic times,

06:17.500 --> 06:21.133
but they are exciting times, um, with the merger.

06:21.200 --> 06:22.734
Uh, and things move fast.

06:22.801 --> 06:24.734
Only two weeks ago,

06:24.801 --> 06:27.601
I was telling them at the party I'd decided to stay after all.

06:27.667 --> 06:30.701
And you saw how relieved they were at that.

06:30.767 --> 06:35.234
Um, but we've had a personnel change of 20-25%, you know. People coming and going.

06:35.300 --> 06:37.033
Um, redundancies,

06:37.100 --> 06:40.033
some voluntary, some involuntary, which is always hard.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.734
I had to let my PA go.

06:41.801 --> 06:46.834
Um, last in, first out, which, you know, was really sad.

06:46.901 --> 06:48.267
So that was upsetting,

06:48.334 --> 06:50.834
but um... I'm coping.

06:50.901 --> 06:52.634
I rolled with the punch, you know.

06:52.701 --> 06:56.534
And it turns out that Dawn can do a lot of it anyway, so...

06:56.601 --> 06:59.000
I'm sure there's gonna be plenty time for this later.

06:59.067 --> 07:00.500
I just thought I'd give you some of this...

07:00.567 --> 07:02.500
-Oh, sorry, is that in your way? -No.

07:02.567 --> 07:03.934
You can just set it down there 'cause I'll move that.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
It's actually... Oh, God. Look at that! Stupid.

07:08.067 --> 07:12.400
Get UK Manager Of The Month, Inside Paper, and I pull a dull face. Typical.

07:12.467 --> 07:14.067
You look quite young there.

07:14.133 --> 07:15.901
Yeah. Photogenic, sort of natural.

07:15.968 --> 07:18.634
-It's 18 months old. -Yeah.

07:18.701 --> 07:21.834
I mean to throw that... I got it out today to throw it away, definitely.

07:21.901 --> 07:23.634

Nice. Look at that. Inside Paper.

07:29.434 --> 07:31.500

07:53.167 --> 07:54.968
-Do you want a biscuit? -What is it?

Stop! Move away from the cookie jar!

-It's good. -Mmm-hmm.

08:01.234 --> 08:02.801
Um, what's that? Oh, yeah.

08:02.868 --> 08:04.601
Do you know this little thing we're doing lunchtime?

08:04.667 --> 08:06.200
-Just a welcoming do for the new Swindon lot? -Yeah, yeah.

08:06.267 --> 08:08.234
Just a meet and greet.

08:08.300 --> 08:11.500
And I'll be doing a speech, so no heckling.

08:11.567 --> 08:12.767
I've got a joke for you.

08:12.834 --> 08:14.534
Well, I don't usually do jokes, but go on.

08:14.601 --> 08:16.334
All right. It's Christmas dinner.

"Okay, we'll play 20 Questions.

08:22.133 --> 08:24.534
"I'll think of something. You have to ask me questions and guess what it is."

08:24.601 --> 08:26.734
So, what she's thinking is a black man's cock.

08:26.801 --> 08:29.033
Oh! Trust Camilla.

08:29.100 --> 08:30.734
-It's not racist, is it? No. -No.

08:30.801 --> 08:33.534
Um, so, Prince Philip goes, "Is it big in the bread bin?"

08:33.601 --> 08:35.500
-Mmm. -She goes, "Yeah."

08:35.567 --> 08:37.267
Prince Charles goes, "Is it something that I can put it in my mouth?"

08:37.334 --> 08:38.534
She goes, "Yeah."

08:38.601 --> 08:41.200
Queen goes, "Is it a black man's cock?"

08:42.434 --> 08:44.200
She's guessed it. From those clues.

-Straightaway. -(DAVID LAUGHS)

Oh, God. That's the sort of stuff I write.

08:48.667 --> 08:50.267
Well, you didn't write it, you just told it,

08:50.334 --> 08:53.834
but you know, well done. So, do it again.

If you ask me what vibe I'm going to lay down,

09:23.400 --> 09:25.367
it's gonna be a very much just a chill-out,

Very much holding Neil's hand. Daunting for him. Uh, sure.

09:43.367 --> 09:46.400
Oh, no. Oh, no. Dawn, you know I don't drink.

09:47.834 --> 09:49.934
Huh?

09:50.000 --> 09:52.434
Just do it and she gave me some wine, and I went, "No, I don't drink."

09:53.234 --> 09:55.467
Do you not drink?

Just keep it short. Bring me on. Enjoy the show.

10:30.701 --> 10:31.834
Okay.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.801
Some people are intimidated

10:36.868 --> 10:40.033
when talking to large numbers of people in an entertaining way.

10:40.100 --> 10:43.067
Not me, you know. I've had experience, so I'm...

10:43.133 --> 10:45.734
At one of the Coventry conferences, some of us put on a little revue.

10:45.801 --> 10:47.467
That was the main thing, and I did impressions

10:47.534 --> 10:50.701
of the conference coordinator, um, Eric Hitchmo.

10:50.767 --> 10:54.534
And, uh, he talks like this, and he always says one thing,

10:54.601 --> 10:57.868
"I don't agree with that in the workplace." Yes, ask them.

10:57.934 --> 11:00.100
And, um, I did him as famous people.

11:00.167 --> 11:02.667
Like the compere would go, "Lieutenant Columbo." And I'd come out in a mac.

11:02.734 --> 11:05.567
And I go, (IMITATING COLUMBO) "Yeah, one final thing, my wife loves you,

11:05.634 --> 11:07.467
(SWITCHES ACCENT) "but I don't agree with that in the workplace."

11:07.534 --> 11:10.601
That's great. And I did him as Basil Fawlty.

11:10.667 --> 11:12.601
(IMITATING BASIL FAWLTY) "I think I mentioned it once,

11:12.667 --> 11:15.901
"but I got away with it, and I don't agree with that in the workplace."

11:15.968 --> 11:19.767
And they were cracking up. And he loved it 'cause it was nothing vicious.

11:19.834 --> 11:24.734
You know, some "comedians" would have picked other stuff, you know, been more nasty.

11:24.801 --> 11:27.000
Like he's got a little withered hand, like Jeremy Beadle.

11:27.067 --> 11:29.033
I didn't mention it.

11:29.100 --> 11:30.968
No need.

11:31.033 --> 11:33.601
Okay. Hello, everyone. Um...

11:33.667 --> 11:35.868
For those who don't know me, my name's Neil Godwin.

11:35.934 --> 11:37.200
-Hello, Neil. -Hello.

11:37.267 --> 11:39.133
For those of you that do know me, keep schtum.

11:39.200 --> 11:40.868
(ALL CHUCKLING)

11:40.934 --> 11:43.033
I'm a man of simple pleasures.

11:43.100 --> 11:46.901
I don't need lovely houses, beautiful girls and classy restaurants,

11:46.968 --> 11:50.701
so it's a good job I moved to Slough.

11:50.767 --> 11:52.868
No, it's great to be in Slough, really it is.

11:52.934 --> 11:54.601
I've just spent a year in Beirut.

11:54.667 --> 11:58.100
(PEOPLE LAUGH)

11:58.167 --> 12:01.901
Now, I know David is feeling a bit worried about taking on all these new staff.

12:01.968 --> 12:05.400
Because as manager, it's gonna mean a lot more responsibility.

12:05.467 --> 12:08.467
He'll now have to delegate twice as much work.

12:08.534 --> 12:11.267
But there will be perks for him.

12:11.334 --> 12:14.434
I'm sure he's looking forward to having a whole new group

12:14.500 --> 12:16.234
-(LAUGHING) -MAN: Whoo!

12:16.300 --> 12:19.334
Anyway, here's the man at the top of the pile, David Brent.

12:22.701 --> 12:24.734
Thanks. Right.

12:24.801 --> 12:27.267
You know he was saying about me being at the top of a pile of men?

12:27.334 --> 12:29.934
Saying I'm gay. All right, I'm not gay.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.667
In fact, I can honestly say I've never come over a little queer.

12:37.267 --> 12:39.500
Let's get to the real stuff.

12:39.567 --> 12:42.367
That was just... He was putting me on.

12:42.434 --> 12:45.834
Welcome to Slough, to the new people.

12:45.901 --> 12:47.868
Uh, my name's David Brent.

12:47.934 --> 12:50.801
And um, I've always been in the paper industry.

12:50.868 --> 12:52.000
I don't know, yeah.

12:52.067 --> 12:54.167
My parents owned a paper shop,

12:54.234 --> 12:56.901
until it blew away... 'Cause it was paper.

12:56.968 --> 13:00.267
There's better ones than that. Okay.

13:00.334 --> 13:03.300
Yeah, I'm not used to public squeaking.

13:03.367 --> 13:05.801
And I pis-pronunciate a lot of my worms.

13:07.500 --> 13:08.601
Ooh.

13:08.801 --> 13:10.200
D'you know, that's The Two Ronnies.

13:10.267 --> 13:11.767
Did you not like that? That is classic stuff.

13:11.834 --> 13:15.000
-(MOBILE RINGS) -Turn the phone off. That's part of it.

13:19.500 --> 13:22.801
Anyway, good to have you all here from Swindon.

13:22.868 --> 13:25.467
'Cause I hear they dropped an atomic bomb on Swindon.

13:31.367 --> 13:32.968
Let's... Right.

13:37.267 --> 13:39.801
Oh, it's a good job Eric Hitchmo isn't here.

13:39.868 --> 13:41.434
'Cause you know what he'd say,

13:41.500 --> 13:43.968
"I don't agree with that in the workplace." Wouldn't he?

13:44.033 --> 13:48.734

14:09.834 --> 14:12.300
Who's been to the Coventry conference?

14:12.367 --> 14:14.767
Right. So, do you not know Eric Hitchmo?

14:14.834 --> 14:16.701
Oh, yeah. But I didn't know he talked like that.

14:16.767 --> 14:19.567
DAVID: Talks exactly like that. Don't he, Gareth?

14:19.634 --> 14:21.534
I prefer the stuff you do about his little hand.

14:21.601 --> 14:23.200
I don't do stuff about his little hand.

I don't think Neil warmed you up, to be honest, you know.

That's why it went over. He's not a professional

16:30.500 --> 16:31.834
He was funny, though.

Yeah, but often an amateur will stitch up a professional.

I can't believe that you think the way to welcome people is by telling racist

17:48.734 --> 17:52.701
Wrong. No way. But he'd heard it before. Right?

17:52.767 --> 17:55.033
He thought it was funny, so I don't see why he's complaining now.

17:55.100 --> 17:57.634
He? It was a woman.

I thought... I assumed it was the new guy.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.234
Won't be funny now, will it?

18:08.300 --> 18:11.100
I don't care. What's the content?

18:11.167 --> 18:13.300
Royal family sitting at home, Christmas Day.

18:13.367 --> 18:15.801
And Camilla goes, "Well, let's play a game.

18:15.868 --> 18:18.133
"I'll think of something. And you have to guess what I'm thinking of."

18:18.200 --> 18:23.300
And what she's actually thinking of is a black man's cock.

18:23.367 --> 18:28.033
So, Charles goes, "Is it big in the bread bin?" Camilla goes, "Yeah."

18:28.100 --> 18:31.901
So, Philip goes, "Can I put it in my mouth?" Camilla goes, "Yeah."

18:31.968 --> 18:35.400
So the Queen goes, "Oh, is it a black man's cock?"

18:35.467 --> 18:39.267
And he's heard it before. So that's the sort of... Yeah.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.534
I can see why someone would find that offensive.

18:44.601 --> 18:47.834
It's not racist though, is it? I didn't say anything bad

18:47.901 --> 18:49.534
It's about a black man's cock.

18:49.601 --> 18:51.934
Why is that racist? It just happens to be a black man's cock.

18:52.133 --> 18:54.200
No, you're using the ethnic stereotype

18:54.267 --> 18:55.667
that black men have large penises

18:55.734 --> 18:57.834
because you think that makes it funnier.

18:57.901 --> 19:00.067
It's not an insult though, is it? It's a compliment if anything.

19:00.133 --> 19:02.033
So, what you're saying is that

19:02.100 --> 19:04.067
black people ought to be flattered

19:04.133 --> 19:05.767
that their only achievement in this world is having oversized genitalia?

19:05.834 --> 19:08.801
-I'm saying they shouldn't be ashamed of 'em. -It's a myth.

19:08.868 --> 19:13.100

19:13.167 --> 19:14.834
Could you?

Well, I haven't got it with me, but when you're next in.

19:20.067 --> 19:23.934
I could change it. I could just say "big cock". Not mention the colour.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.767
Well, you could, or you could save those jokes for your free time

19:26.834 --> 19:29.901
and not tell them in the workplace.

19:29.968 --> 19:31.601
It was his joke. He told me it.

19:31.667 --> 19:33.234
Yeah, whatever, David. Let's leave it there.

19:36.133 --> 19:37.934
Yeah. (CLEARS THROAT)

19:39.400 --> 19:41.534
(SIGHS) She's right to be careful,

19:41.601 --> 19:46.133
'cause some of them can be a little bit sensitive, you know, so...

19:46.200 --> 19:48.500
Sorry, who's insensitive?

19:48.567 --> 19:51.801
Some people can take things the wrong way.

19:51.868 --> 19:55.400
-Sure. Uh-huh. -Oh, as an actress said to a bishop.

19:55.467 --> 19:58.000
And that's not a gay stereotype, the wrong way.

19:58.067 --> 20:01.400
I'm not saying that is the wrong way. I'm saying it's a way.

20:01.467 --> 20:03.534
Some women like it the wrong way, don't they?

20:03.601 --> 20:06.267
And they're straight. It doesn't matter if you're straight or gay, you know.

20:06.334 --> 20:09.734
A lot of people are. And one in 10, apparently. That seems

20:09.801 --> 20:13.067
But, you know, you might be gay. If you are, good luck to ya.

You know, just, just make sure it's legal, and be safe. Okay?

20:21.834 --> 20:23.200
That's it, see,

20:23.267 --> 20:26.200
a lot of people can't keep up with

20:26.267 --> 20:29.334
what words are acceptable these days and what words aren't.

20:29.400 --> 20:32.334
Uh, it's like my dad, for example.

20:32.400 --> 20:36.500
He's not as cosmopolitan or as educated as me.

20:36.567 --> 20:39.234
And it can be embarrassing,

20:39.300 --> 20:41.567
you know, he doesn't understand all the new trendy words,

20:41.634 --> 20:45.100
like he'll say "poofs" instead of "gays".

20:45.167 --> 20:48.467
Um, "birds" instead of "women".

20:48.534 --> 20:51.400
"Darkies" instead of "coloureds".

David, we've talked about this. I think I made myself perfectly clear.

21:45.734 --> 21:47.434
Yep, interesting.

21:47.500 --> 21:48.534
-I'll see you later, David. Goodbye. -Yeah, yeah.

21:48.601 --> 21:51.500
-Goodbye. -Goodbye.

21:51.567 --> 21:53.467
She should chill out a bit more, shouldn't she?

21:53.534 --> 21:55.934
Maybe a bit of the old (BLOWING) ganja.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.901
Do you know what I mean? Course you do. Oh!

21:58.968 --> 22:00.267
Meetings would be a bit different. Wouldn't it?

22:00.334 --> 22:02.767
"Uh, yes, David, I've called this meeting

22:02.834 --> 22:07.834
"'cause I want you to go down the 24-hour garage and get me some HobNobs." Wouldn't it?

22:09.334 --> 22:11.634
All right. Like Scooby-Doo, all the Scooby snacks,

22:11.701 --> 22:13.234
'cause he's got the munchies, didn't he?

22:13.300 --> 22:16.133
More like Scooby-Doo, dooby-dooby-doo.

22:16.200 --> 22:17.667
(IMITATING SCOOBY-DOO) Shaggy!

22:17.734 --> 22:20.767
I was not advocating the use of drugs.

22:20.834 --> 22:23.234
I was talking to someone on their level

22:23.300 --> 22:26.934
'cause I can communicate with people from all walks of life.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.801
-Do you want one? -Mmm.

22:29.667 --> 22:30.734
Snacks.

22:32.434 --> 22:34.234
So when did you come up?

22:34.300 --> 22:35.601
Um, Saturday.

22:35.667 --> 22:39.000
Mmm. Saturday.

22:39.067 --> 22:42.467
Um, was it your mum or your boyfriend or whatever, drove you? Or...

22:42.534 --> 22:45.734
-No. My brother came up with me. -Okay.

22:45.801 --> 22:46.934
Have you got a lot of ties in Swindon,

22:47.000 --> 22:49.834
or are you starting again up here?

22:49.901 --> 22:51.734
I'll be... I'll be going back weekends.

22:51.801 --> 22:53.367
Oh, right. Okay.

22:54.434 --> 22:55.667
So...

22:55.734 --> 22:58.234
Sorry, so have you got a boyfriend or not?

22:59.767 --> 23:01.400
Uh, no, I haven't.

23:02.968 --> 23:04.500
Uh, I think I left my drink.

23:04.567 --> 23:09.567
-I'm just gonna... Okay. -Okay, yeah, see you in a bit.

23:09.634 --> 23:13.801
Tim, I know you don't mean to, but you're sort of cramping my style a bit.

23:13.868 --> 23:17.434
-What? -I'm kind of planning to get off with her. So...

23:17.500 --> 23:20.334
Are you jok... Gareth, what if I liked her?

23:20.400 --> 23:21.767
I saw her first, mate.

23:21.834 --> 23:23.534
And how does that work?

23:27.901 --> 23:31.100
So you've won the argument doing that, then? Yeah, of course.

23:31.167 --> 23:32.367
That's won the argument.

23:43.934 --> 23:45.100
(SIGHS)

23:46.067 --> 23:47.334
Ah, the room's nice.

23:50.934 --> 23:52.267
-Hi. -Hiya.

23:52.334 --> 23:54.100
They came for the package.

23:54.167 --> 23:55.801
-Oh, they came, did they? Good. That's good. -Good. No problem.

23:55.868 --> 23:57.300
Cool.

23:57.367 --> 23:59.300
I'm so bored.

23:59.367 --> 24:03.500
-Are you? All right. Okay. -Do you want to wind up Gareth for a bit?

24:03.567 --> 24:07.100
Um, well, no. I don't think we should. He's a bit busy. So...

24:07.534 --> 24:09.200
So?

24:09.267 --> 24:11.200
So am I, Dawn, actually.

24:12.133 --> 24:13.734
So should you be.

24:21.434 --> 24:23.434
Is that what you're going?

24:24.334 --> 24:26.067
A few things, then.

24:48.167 --> 24:50.234
Um, Dawn, hello.

24:50.300 --> 24:51.801
Uh... Just I've been checking my diary.

24:51.868 --> 24:54.934
I've been overlooking something. So have you, actually.

24:55.133 --> 24:59.267
There's a 20-minute window I've got here, it says to wind up Gareth with Dawn.

24:59.334 --> 25:02.167
-So, shall we do that? Shall we? -Mmm.

25:03.801 --> 25:06.534
(CLEARS THROAT) This way please, madam.

25:06.601 --> 25:08.267
MAN 1: Oh, no, please. I'm not in the mood.

25:08.334 --> 25:09.934
MAN 1: I'm working. MAN 2: Just a quick one.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.534
Did you see that film last night, Gaylords Say No?

25:12.601 --> 25:14.534
-No. -(TIM AND DAWN LAUGH)

25:24.601 --> 25:29.167
Sorry, um, can I have a quick word with everyone?

25:29.234 --> 25:35.334
Um, I'm mainly talking to the Swindon lot here.

25:35.400 --> 25:39.234
Some of you seem to have got off on the wrong foot with me. Yeah?

25:39.300 --> 25:43.334
I don't think, you know, you didn't like some of the jokes I told earlier.

25:43.400 --> 25:45.968
You've got to chill out. Yeah? Trust me.

25:46.033 --> 25:47.567
This is what I do.

25:48.601 --> 25:50.467
All right?

25:50.534 --> 25:54.834
You will never work in a place like this again. This is brilliant. Fact. Yeah?

25:54.901 --> 25:56.801
And you'll never have another boss like me,

25:56.868 --> 25:59.834
someone who's actually a chilled-out entertainer. Yeah?

25:59.901 --> 26:03.968
Now, some of you maybe didn't understand the jokes,

26:04.033 --> 26:07.300
I was making and misinterpreted one, and went to Jennifer. Okay.

26:07.367 --> 26:10.667
Um, little bit annoyed that you thought that you'd go to Jennifer and not me.

26:10.734 --> 26:14.434
Who was it that complained? And it's not a witch hunt. Just who was it that...

26:14.500 --> 26:17.701
Okay? Who? Two of you. Good. Right.

26:17.767 --> 26:22.734
You... Um, why did you think you'd go to Jennifer but not me?

26:22.801 --> 26:23.934
-'Cause I didn't know you and I didn't like... -Sure.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.200
-...the kind of joke you were telling.

26:26.267 --> 26:28.500
And I don't think somebody in your position should be laughing at black people.

26:28.567 --> 26:32.634
It's funny that only two of you thought that out of everyone, but, you know...

26:32.701 --> 26:35.734
-Um, I didn't like it either. -Right, proves my point.

26:35.801 --> 26:38.267
Swindon. You're new. You don't know me.

26:38.334 --> 26:39.968
I'm not new and I found it quite offensive.

26:40.033 --> 26:41.200
Right. Well, he didn't.

26:41.267 --> 26:42.968
WOMAN: But what's he got to do with it?

26:43.167 --> 26:46.300
Well, if he doesn't mind us laughing at him, what harm's

26:46.367 --> 26:51.300
But why is it that only black people should be offended by racism?

26:51.367 --> 26:55.467
Good point. Yeah. First sensible thing you've said all day. Yeah.

26:55.534 --> 27:00.367
Because I say, "Come one, come all. We're all the same." Yeah? That's...

27:00.434 --> 27:03.934
So is that why you've only got one black guy in the whole organisation?

27:04.000 --> 27:06.934
Wrong. Yeah? Indian fellow in the warehouse.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.767
And there used to be one Indian fellow who used to work up here.

27:09.834 --> 27:12.934
Lovely chap. He left. Didn't like it. Up to him. You know.

27:13.133 --> 27:16.868
If I had my way, the place'd be full of them, wouldn't it, Gareth?

27:16.934 --> 27:17.901
Yeah, well, half and half.

27:17.968 --> 27:19.434
DAVID: Yeah.

27:19.500 --> 27:21.100
You are half and half, aren't you?

27:21.167 --> 27:23.234
-I'm mixed race, yes. -Uh.

27:23.300 --> 27:26.267
That is my favourite. Yeah. That is what I'm trying to...

27:26.334 --> 27:29.167
That's the melting pot, please.

27:29.234 --> 27:31.968
So, there's your "racist" for you.

27:33.167 --> 27:34.267
So...

27:49.968 --> 27:52.901
-He did. He said melting pot! Oh, my God. -He didn't.

27:52.968 --> 27:56.267
-He did. Oh, my God. -He didn't actually do the fingers.

27:56.334 --> 27:58.834
Oh, let's... Come on, let's just get on.

27:58.901 --> 28:00.701
DAWN: Yeah, it just... TIM: Come on, please. Let's love each...

28:00.767 --> 28:04.734
# What David needs is a great, big melting pot #

28:05.968 --> 28:07.033
Lee!

28:07.767 --> 28:09.000
All right.

28:14.534 --> 28:15.434
Dawn...

28:19.734 --> 28:20.934
(SIGHS)

28:26.133 --> 28:27.400
All right.

28:28.801 --> 28:30.100
(CLEARS THROAT)

28:34.601 --> 28:35.534
Phew!

28:42.801 --> 28:45.067
# So what becomes of you, my love

28:48.601 --> 28:53.234
# When they have finally stripped you of

28:53.300 --> 28:55.701
# The handbags and the gladrags

28:55.767 --> 29:00.701
# That your granddad had to sweat so you could buy #
