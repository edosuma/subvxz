NARRATOR:
This story is about Howard Beale...

00:18.645 --> 00:21.814
...who was the Network News anchorman
on UBS TV.

00:21.982 --> 00:25.193
In his time, Howard Beale
had been a mandarin of television.

00:25.360 --> 00:30.489
The grand old man of news, with a HUT
rating of 16 and a 28 audience share.

00:30.657 --> 00:34.202
In 1969, however, his fortunes began to decline.

00:34.369 --> 00:36.078
He fell to a 22 share.

00:36.246 --> 00:40.041
The following year his wife died,
and he was left a childless widower...

00:40.209 --> 00:42.251
...with an 8 rating and a 12 share.

00:42.419 --> 00:45.880
He became morose and isolated,
began to drink heavily.

00:46.048 --> 00:49.717
And on September 22, 1975, he was fired...

00:49.885 --> 00:51.594
...effective in two weeks.

00:51.762 --> 00:54.347
The news was broken to him by Max Schumacher...

00:54.514 --> 00:57.350
...who was the president
of the news division at UBS.

00:57.517 --> 01:00.144
The two old friends got properly pissed.

01:00.312 --> 01:05.191
I was at CBS with Ed Murrow in 1951.

01:05.943 --> 01:08.194
Must've been 1950, then.

01:08.362 --> 01:13.366
I was NBC, uh, associate producer, Morning News.

01:13.533 --> 01:15.660
I was just a kid, 26 years old.

01:17.329 --> 01:18.454
Anyway...

01:18.830 --> 01:23.584
Anyway, they were building the lower level
of the George Washington Bridge.

01:24.378 --> 01:26.337
We were doing a remote from there.

01:34.638 --> 01:36.931
Then after 7 in the morning, I get a call.

01:37.099 --> 01:41.310
"Where the hell are you? You're supposed
to be on the George Washington Bridge."

01:42.271 --> 01:45.982
I jump out of bed,
throw my raincoat over my pajamas.

01:46.149 --> 01:50.069
I run down the stairs,
I run out in the street, hail a cab.

01:50.237 --> 01:54.782
And I say to the cabby, "Take me to the
middle of the George Washington Bridge."

01:54.950 --> 01:57.118
[BOTH LAUGHING]

01:57.286 --> 02:00.746
And the cabbie turns around and he says...

02:01.623 --> 02:04.500
He says, "Don't do it, buddy.

02:05.043 --> 02:06.711
You're a young man.

12:26.956 --> 12:30.709
- Listen, Max, I'd like another shot.
- Oh, come on, Howard.

12:30.877 --> 12:32.628

I don't mean the whole show...

12:32.795 --> 12:36.465
I'd just like to come on,
make some brief farewell statement...

12:36.633 --> 12:39.635
...and then turn the show over
to Jack Snowden.

12:39.802 --> 12:41.845
I have 11 years at this network, Max.

12:42.013 --> 12:43.722
I have some standing in the industry.

12:43.890 --> 12:46.183
I just don't wanna go out like a clown.

12:51.189 --> 12:53.857

13:30.770 --> 13:34.523
Uh, this is Bill Herron from our
West Coast Special Programs Department.

13:34.691 --> 13:37.317
George Bosch, Barbara Schlesinger,
Tommy Pellegrino.

13:37.485 --> 13:40.779
Look, I just saw some rough footage
of a special Bill's doing...

13:40.947 --> 13:43.740
...on the revolutionary underground.
Most is tedious stuff...

13:43.908 --> 13:47.411
...of Laureen Hobbs and two fatigue jackets
muttering mutilated Marxism.

13:47.578 --> 13:51.581
But he's got about eight minutes
of a bank robbery...

13:51.749 --> 13:54.793
...that is absolutely sensational.
Authentic stuff.

13:54.961 --> 13:57.921
Actually shot while the robbery was going on.

13:58.089 --> 14:00.340
You remember the Mary Ann Gifford kidnapping?

14:00.591 --> 14:04.261
It's that bunch of nuts. She's in the movie
shooting off machine guns.

14:04.429 --> 14:08.932
Really terrific footage. I think we can get
a hell of a Movie of the Week out of it...

14:09.100 --> 14:10.225
...maybe even a series.

14:11.519 --> 14:13.729
A series out of what?
What are we talking about?

14:13.896 --> 14:16.398
Look, we've got a bunch of hobgoblin radicals...

14:16.566 --> 14:18.567
...called the Ecumenical
Liberation Army...

14:18.735 --> 14:22.154
...who go around taking home movies
of themselves robbing banks.

14:22.321 --> 14:25.073
And maybe they'll take movies
of themselves kidnapping heiresses...

14:25.241 --> 14:29.411
...um, hijacking 747s, bombing bridges,
assassinating ambassadors.

14:31.497 --> 14:34.416
We'd open each week's segment
with that authentic footage...

14:34.584 --> 14:37.252
...hire writers to write some story
behind that footage...

14:37.420 --> 14:39.588

14:54.687 --> 14:57.355
Look, I sent you all
a concept-analysis report yesterday.

14:57.523 --> 14:59.357
Did any of you read it?

15:01.569 --> 15:05.072
Well, in a nutshell, it said
the American people are turning sullen.

15:05.239 --> 15:09.159
They've been clobbered by Vietnam,
Watergate, inflation, the Depression.

15:09.327 --> 15:12.913
They've turned off, shot up and fucked
themselves limp. And nothing helps.

15:13.081 --> 15:17.793
So this concept-analysis report concludes
the American people want somebody...

15:17.960 --> 15:20.796
...to articulate their rage for them.

15:20.963 --> 15:24.091
I've been telling you people
since I took this job six months ago...

15:24.258 --> 15:26.343
...that I want angry shows.

15:26.511 --> 15:30.097
I don't want conventional programming
on this network, I want counterculture.

15:30.264 --> 15:32.265
I want antiestablishment.

15:34.685 --> 15:38.271
I don't wanna play butch boss with you people.

15:38.606 --> 15:40.232
When I took over this department...

15:40.399 --> 15:43.193
...it had the worst programming record
in television history.

15:43.653 --> 15:45.654
This network hasn't one show in the top 20.

15:45.822 --> 15:48.156
This network is an industry joke.

15:48.324 --> 15:51.368
And we better start putting together
one winner for next September.

15:51.536 --> 15:57.082
I want a show developed based
on the activities of a terrorist group.

15:57.250 --> 15:59.543
Joseph Stalin and his merry band of Bolsheviks.

15:59.710 --> 16:03.130
I want ideas from you people.
That is what you're paid for.

16:03.297 --> 16:07.050
And, by the way, the next time I send
an audience research report around...

16:07.218 --> 16:11.054
...you'd all better read it, or I'll sack
the fucking lot of you, is that clear?

16:11.222 --> 16:13.390
I'll be out on the coast in, uh, four weeks.

16:13.558 --> 16:15.642
Will you set up a meeting with Laureen Hobbs?

16:15.810 --> 16:16.852
Sure.

16:17.270 --> 16:20.480
But the business of management is management.

16:20.648 --> 16:23.358
And at the time CCA took control
of the UBS TV Network...

16:23.526 --> 16:27.487
...it was foundering with less than
7 percent of national television revenues...

16:27.655 --> 16:30.240
...most network programs being sold
at station rates.

16:30.408 --> 16:33.618
I am pleased to announce I am
submitting to the board of directors...

16:33.786 --> 16:36.872
...a plan for the coordination
of the main profit centers.

16:37.039 --> 16:38.623
And with the specific intention...

16:38.791 --> 16:42.961
...of making each division
more responsive to management.

16:43.588 --> 16:45.297
Point one.

16:45.923 --> 16:49.926
The division producing the lowest rate
of return has been the news division...

16:50.094 --> 16:55.724
...with its $98 million budget and
its average annual deficit of 32 million.

16:56.225 --> 16:59.436
I know that, historically, news divisions
are expected to lose money.

16:59.604 --> 17:03.023
But to our minds, this philosophy
is a wanton fiscal affront...

17:03.191 --> 17:05.817
...to be resolutely resisted.

17:06.277 --> 17:10.946
The new plan calls for local news to be
transferred to owned stations' divisions.

17:11.115 --> 17:15.327
News radio would be transferred
to the UBS Radio Division and in effect...

17:16.494 --> 17:19.705
...the news division would be reduced
from an independent division...

17:19.874 --> 17:23.835
...to a department accountable
to network.

17:29.133 --> 17:32.260

- This is not the time, Max.

17:32.428 --> 17:34.429

17:34.597 --> 17:37.349
Why was I led up onto that podium
and publicly humiliated...

17:37.516 --> 17:39.142

17:41.812 --> 17:43.980

the news division was safe.

Helen, call Mr. Hackett's office.

24:53.619 --> 24:56.329
See if he can give me
a few minutes this morning.

25:02.252 --> 25:06.464
KTNS, Kansas City, refuses to carry
our Network News show anymore...

25:06.632 --> 25:08.383
...unless Beale is taken off the air.

25:08.550 --> 25:10.760
Did you see the overnights on the Network News?

25:10.928 --> 25:15.556
It has an eight in New York, a nine in L.A.
and a 27 share in both cities.

25:15.724 --> 25:19.435
Last night Howard Beale went on the air
and yelled "bullshit" for two minutes...

25:19.603 --> 25:23.564
...and I can tell you right now that tonight's
show will get a 30 share, at least.

25:23.732 --> 25:25.441
I think we've lucked into something.

25:25.609 --> 25:28.486
For God's sakes. Are you suggesting
that we put that lunatic...

25:28.654 --> 25:30.446
...back on the air yelling "bullshit"?

25:30.614 --> 25:33.783
I think we should put Beale back
on the air tonight and keep him on.

25:33.951 --> 25:36.619

Did you see the Times?

25:36.787 --> 25:40.331
We've got press on this you couldn't buy
for a million dollars. Frank.

25:40.499 --> 25:43.793
That dumb show jumped
five rating points in one night.

25:43.961 --> 25:45.837
Tonight's show has gotta be at least 15.

25:46.004 --> 25:49.841

by 20 or 30 million people in one night.

You can't piss it away.

25:54.930 --> 25:57.056
Howard Beale said what every American feels...

25:57.224 --> 26:02.145
...that he's tired of all the bullshit.
He's articulating the popular rage.

26:02.438 --> 26:06.482
I want that show, Frank. I can turn that
show into the biggest smash on television.

What do you mean? It's a news show.
It's not your department.

26:09.778 --> 26:12.363

as a latter-day prophet.

against the hypocrisies of our times.

the revenues of a strip show...

26:31.383 --> 26:33.301

26:33.469 --> 26:36.304

this network out of the hole.

...we're talking about putting a manifestly
irresponsible man on national television.

evening news with Howard Beale.

NARRATOR: The initial response to the new
Howard Beale Show was not auspicatory.

33:48.195 --> 33:52.448
The press was without exception hostile
and the industry reaction negative.

33:52.616 --> 33:55.618
The ratings for the Thursday
and Friday shows were both 14.

33:55.785 --> 33:57.745
But Monday's rating dropped a point...

33:57.913 --> 34:01.332
...clearly suggesting
the novelty was wearing off.

34:02.792 --> 34:05.002
Did you know there are a number of psychics...

34:05.170 --> 34:07.796
...working as licensed brokers
on Wall Street?

34:07.964 --> 34:10.632
Some of them counsel their clients
by use of tarot cards.

34:10.800 --> 34:14.178
They're all pretty successful,
even in a bear market and selling short.

34:14.346 --> 34:17.764
I met one of them last week
and thought of doing a show around her.

34:17.933 --> 34:20.601
The Wayward Witch of Wall Street,
something like that.

34:20.768 --> 34:23.270
If her tips were any good,
she could wreck the market.

34:23.438 --> 34:28.817
So I called her this morning and asked her
how she was on predicting the future.

34:28.985 --> 34:31.527
She said she was occasionally prescient.

34:31.696 --> 34:33.572
For example, she said:

34:33.739 --> 34:36.324
"I just had a fleeting vision of you...

34:36.493 --> 34:39.370
...sitting in an office
with a craggy middle-aged man...

34:39.536 --> 34:43.081
...with whom you are,
or will be, emotionally involved."

34:43.250 --> 34:44.500
And here I am.

34:46.962 --> 34:48.837
And she does all this with tarot cards?

34:49.005 --> 34:52.466
No. This one operates on parapsychology.

34:52.634 --> 34:56.844
She has trance-like episodes
and feels things in her energy field.

34:57.973 --> 35:00.474
I think this lady could
be very useful to you, Max.

35:00.850 --> 35:02.518
- In what way?
- Well...

35:02.686 --> 35:05.854
...you put on a news show
and here's somebody who can predict...

35:06.022 --> 35:07.606
...tomorrow's news for you.

35:07.774 --> 35:10.401
Her name, aptly enough, is Sibyl.

35:10.568 --> 35:11.902
Sibyl the Soothsayer.

35:12.070 --> 35:15.656
You could give her two minutes of trance
at the end of a Howard Beale Show...

35:15.824 --> 35:17.199
...say, once a week, Friday...

35:17.367 --> 35:20.452
...which is suggestively occult,
and she could oraculate.

35:20.620 --> 35:24.665
Then next week everyone tunes in to see
how good her predictions were.

35:25.542 --> 35:27.084

some help, Max, if it's gonna hold.

I think you should take on a couple of
writers to write some jeremiads for him.

- What do you want me to do?
- Nothing.

"Don't worry about the truth.

I will put the words in your mouth."

For God's sake, I'm not Moses."

The voice said to me, "And I'm not God.
What has that got to do with it?"

44:03.059 --> 44:04.142
The voice said to me:

44:04.310 --> 44:07.354
"We're not talking about eternal

01:03:28.431 --> 01:03:33.227
...of the Union Broadcasting Systems
and he died at 11:00 this morning...

...of a heart condition, and woe is us,
we're in a lot of trouble.

...and 62 million other Americans
are listening to me right now.

01:04:00.213 --> 01:04:04.383
Because less than 3 percent
of you people read books.

01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:08.929
Because less than 15 percent of you
read newspapers.

01:04:09.097 --> 01:04:12.766

is what you get over this tube.

01:04:16.604 --> 01:04:20.232

that didn't come out of this tube.

Maybe we're overstating
Beale's clout with the public.

01:29:12.516 --> 01:29:15.100
An hour ago, Clarence McElheny
called me from New York.

01:29:15.268 --> 01:29:18.479
It was 10:00 in the east and our people
in the White House report...

01:29:18.647 --> 01:29:21.482
...they were already knee-deep in telegrams.

01:29:21.650 --> 01:29:26.529
By tomorrow morning,
they'll be suffocating in telegrams.

01:29:26.696 --> 01:29:29.323
- Can the government stop the deal?
- They can hold it up.

01:29:29.491 --> 01:29:32.910
The SEC could hold this deal up
for 20 years, if they wanted to.

01:29:33.161 --> 01:29:34.537
I'm finished.

01:29:34.704 --> 01:29:38.207
Any second that phone's gonna ring
and Clarence McElheny is gonna tell me...

01:29:38.375 --> 01:29:41.210
...Mr. Jensen wants me in his office
tomorrow morning...

01:29:41.378 --> 01:29:44.838
...so he can personally chop my head off.

01:29:45.507 --> 01:29:47.883
Four hours ago, I was the sun god at CCA.

Mr. Jensen's unhappy with Howard Beale

But he may be unhappy,
but he isn't stupid enough...

Two billion dollars isn't pique!
That's the wrath of God!

Every other network will grab him
the minute he walks.

Uh, well, can you give me
a little more time than that?

Mr. Jensen wants to meet
Howard Beale personally.

01:31:28.026 --> 01:31:31.779
He wants Mr. Beale in his office

JENSEN:
Good morning, Mr. Beale.

01:32:12.821 --> 01:32:15.531
- They tell me you're a madman.
- Only desultorily.

01:32:15.699 --> 01:32:18.033
- How are you now?
- I'm as mad as a hatter.

01:32:18.201 --> 01:32:19.868
Who isn't?

01:32:20.453 --> 01:32:22.621
I'm going to take you into our conference room.

01:32:22.789 --> 01:32:26.125
Seems more seemly a setting
for what I have to say to you.

01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:29.878
I started as a salesman, Mr. Beale.

01:32:30.046 --> 01:32:32.923
I sold sewing machines and automobile parts...

01:32:33.091 --> 01:32:36.009
...hairbrushes and electronic equipment.

01:32:36.177 --> 01:32:38.512
They say I can sell anything.

01:32:39.347 --> 01:32:42.599
I'd like to try to sell something to you.

01:32:46.187 --> 01:32:49.815
Valhalla, Mr. Beale. Please, sit down.

01:33:19.304 --> 01:33:24.099
You have meddled with the primal forces
of nature, Mr. Beale.

01:33:24.267 --> 01:33:28.604
And I won't have it! Is that clear?

01:33:28.897 --> 01:33:31.356
You think you've merely stopped a business deal.

01:33:31.524 --> 01:33:33.066
That is not the case.

01:33:33.234 --> 01:33:36.153
The Arabs have taken billions of dollars
out of this country...

01:33:36.321 --> 01:33:38.197
...and now they must put it back!

01:33:38.364 --> 01:33:43.535
It is ebb and flow, tidal gravity,
it is ecological balance.

01:33:45.121 --> 01:33:46.872
You are an old man...

01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:50.876
...who thinks in terms
of nations and peoples.

01:33:51.044 --> 01:33:54.421
There are no nations, there are no peoples.
There are no Russians.

01:33:54.589 --> 01:33:57.049
There are no Arabs.
There are no Third Worlds.

01:33:57.217 --> 01:33:58.383
There is no West!

01:33:58.551 --> 01:34:03.514
There is only one holistic system of systems.

01:34:03.681 --> 01:34:05.891
One vast and immane...

01:34:06.059 --> 01:34:08.894
...interwoven, interacting, multi-variate...

01:34:09.062 --> 01:34:12.231
...multinational dominion of dollars.

01:34:12.398 --> 01:34:15.526
Petrol dollars, electro-dollars,
multi-dollars.

01:34:15.693 --> 01:34:21.448
Reichsmarks, rins, rubles, pounds and shekels.

01:34:22.784 --> 01:34:27.246
It is the international system of currency
which determines...

...the totality of life on this planet.

01:34:31.751 --> 01:34:36.255
That is the natural order of things today.

01:34:37.382 --> 01:34:41.134

...with the primal forces of nature!

And you will atone.

Am I getting it through to you, Mr. Beale?

01:35:08.746 --> 01:35:13.292
You get up on your little 21-inch screen...

01:35:14.002 --> 01:35:18.881
...and howl about America
and democracy.

01:35:19.465 --> 01:35:23.802
There is no America.
There is no democracy.

01:35:23.970 --> 01:35:29.474
There is only IBM and ITT and AT&T...

01:35:29.642 --> 01:35:35.230
...and Dupont, Dow,
Union Carbide, and Exxon.

01:35:35.398 --> 01:35:38.984
Those are the nations of the world today.

01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:43.488
What do you think the Russians talk about
in their councils of state? Karl Marx?

01:35:43.656 --> 01:35:45.991
They get out their linear programming charts...

01:35:46.159 --> 01:35:48.660
...statistical decision theories,
minimax solutions...

01:35:48.828 --> 01:35:52.289
...and compute price-cost probabilities
of transactions and investments...

01:35:52.457 --> 01:35:53.498
...just like we do.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:58.253
We no longer live in a world of nations
and ideologies, Mr. Beale.

01:35:58.421 --> 01:36:03.091
The world is a college of corporations...

01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:10.641
...inexorably determined
by the immutable bylaws of business.

01:36:12.727 --> 01:36:15.687
The world is a business, Mr. Beale.

01:36:17.607 --> 01:36:21.568
It has been since man crawled out of the slime.

01:36:24.364 --> 01:36:29.284
And our children will live, Mr. Beale...

01:36:30.662 --> 01:36:32.245

...oppression or brutality.

One vast and ecumenical holding company...

01:36:50.181 --> 01:36:54.476
...for whom all men will work
to serve a common profit...

01:36:54.644 --> 01:36:58.897
...in which all men will hold
a share of stock...

01:37:00.149 --> 01:37:03.068
...all necessities provided...

01:37:03.778 --> 01:37:07.614
...all anxieties tranquillized...

01:37:08.574 --> 01:37:12.494
...all boredom amused.

01:37:18.459 --> 01:37:23.046
And I have chosen you, Mr. Beale...

01:37:23.214 --> 01:37:25.716
...to preach this evangel.

01:37:26.384 --> 01:37:28.010
Why me?

01:37:29.262 --> 01:37:32.097
Because you're on television, dummy.

01:37:32.974 --> 01:37:38.437
Sixty million people watch you every night
of the week, Monday through Friday.

01:37:39.313 --> 01:37:41.606
I have seen the face of God.

01:37:44.152 --> 01:37:46.737
You just might be right, Mr. Beale.

01:37:48.281 --> 01:37:50.615
NARRATOR: That evening,
Howard Beale went on the air...

01:37:50.783 --> 01:37:53.452
...to preach the corporate cosmology
of Arthur Jensen.

01:37:53.619 --> 01:37:56.496
Last night I got up here and asked you people...

01:37:56.664 --> 01:38:00.959
...to stand up and fight for your heritage,
and you did, and it was beautiful.

01:38:01.127 --> 01:38:04.129
Six million telegrams were received
at the White House.

01:38:04.297 --> 01:38:07.466
The Arab takeover of CCA has been stopped.

01:38:07.633 --> 01:38:13.305
The people spoke, the people won.
It was a radiant eruption of democracy.

01:38:13.473 --> 01:38:17.517
But I think that was it, fellas.

01:38:17.685 --> 01:38:20.395
That sort of thing is not likely
to happen again.

01:38:20.605 --> 01:38:23.565
Because at the bottom
of all our terrified souls...

01:38:23.733 --> 01:38:26.777
...we know that democracy
is a dying giant...

01:38:26.944 --> 01:38:31.740
...a sick, sick, dying, decaying,
political concept writhing in its final pain.

01:38:31.908 --> 01:38:35.494
I don't mean that the United States
is finished as a world power.

01:38:35.661 --> 01:38:37.829
The States is the richest and most powerful...

01:38:37.997 --> 01:38:40.957
...the most advanced country,
light years ahead of any country.

01:38:41.125 --> 01:38:43.835
I don't mean the communists
are gonna take over the world.

01:38:44.003 --> 01:38:47.339
The communists are deader than we are.
What is finished...

01:38:48.966 --> 01:38:52.427
...is the idea that this great country
is dedicated to the freedom...

01:38:52.595 --> 01:38:56.306
...and flourishing of every individual in it.

01:38:57.391 --> 01:39:00.352
It's the individual that's finished.

01:39:00.770 --> 01:39:04.689
It's the single, solitary, human being
that's finished.

01:39:05.566 --> 01:39:09.611
It's every single one of you out there
that's finished.

01:39:10.154 --> 01:39:12.364
Because this is no longer...

01:39:12.532 --> 01:39:16.243
...a nation of independent individuals.

01:39:16.536 --> 01:39:19.329
It's a nation of some 200-odd million...

01:39:19.497 --> 01:39:22.040
...transistorized, deodorized...

01:39:22.208 --> 01:39:27.712
...whiter than white steel-belted bodies,
totally unnecessary as human beings...

01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:31.258
...and as replaceable as piston rods.

01:39:41.894 --> 01:39:45.105
Well, the time has come to say...

01:39:45.273 --> 01:39:48.441
...is "dehumanization" such a bad word?

01:39:48.818 --> 01:39:51.903
Whether it's good or bad, that's what is so.

01:39:52.071 --> 01:39:57.242
The whole world is becoming humanoid,
creatures that look human but aren't.

01:39:57.702 --> 01:39:59.077
The whole world, not just us.

01:39:59.245 --> 01:40:03.415
We're just the most advanced country,
so we're getting there first.

01:40:04.083 --> 01:40:09.045
The whole world's people are becoming
mass-produced, programmed...

01:40:09.213 --> 01:40:10.964
...numbered insensate things.

01:40:11.382 --> 01:40:13.425

It was a perfectly admissible argument...

01:40:13.593 --> 01:40:16.178
...that Howard Beale advanced

01:40:16.345 --> 01:40:19.222
It was, however, also a very depressing one.

01:40:19.390 --> 01:40:22.726
Nobody particularly cared to hear
his life was utterly valueless.

01:40:22.894 --> 01:40:24.728
By the end of the first week in June...

01:40:24.896 --> 01:40:27.647
...the Howard Beale Show
dropped one point in the ratings...

01:40:27.815 --> 01:40:32.444
...and its trend of shares dipped under 48
for the first time since last November.

01:40:32.612 --> 01:40:36.615
You're his goddamn agent. I'm counting
on you to talk some sense into the lunatic.

01:40:36.782 --> 01:40:40.285
Nobody wants to hear about
dying democracy and dehumanization.

01:40:40.912 --> 01:40:41.995
I'm sorry I'm late.

01:40:42.163 --> 01:40:44.372
We're starting to get rumbles from the agencies.

01:40:44.540 --> 01:40:47.334
Another couple of weeks
and the sponsors will be bailing out!

01:40:47.501 --> 01:40:50.629
This is a breach of contract.
This isn't the Howard Beale we signed.

Get him off that corporate universe kick,
or so help me, I'll pull it off the air!

01:40:55.259 --> 01:40:58.386
I told him, Lou! I've been telling him
every day for a week!

01:40:58.554 --> 01:41:01.640
I'm sick of telling him. Now you tell him!

He listens to you. You're his best friend.

...you come back in one of these
middle-aged moods.

I'm tired of finding you on the telephone

...about my maverick days

01:41:39.845 --> 01:41:43.515
Every goddamned executive fired
from a network in the last 20 years...

01:41:43.683 --> 01:41:47.686
...has written this dumb book
about the great early years of television.

01:41:47.853 --> 01:41:51.147
And nobody wants a dumb, damn, goddamn book...

Terrific, Max! Maybe you can start
a whole new career as an actor.

MAX:
It's the truth.

01:41:59.365 --> 01:42:04.119
After living with you for six months,
I'm turning into one of your scripts.

01:42:04.912 --> 01:42:07.372
Well, this is not a script, Diana.

01:42:07.707 --> 01:42:11.334
There's some real, actual life going on here.

01:42:12.128 --> 01:42:15.714
I went to visit my wife today
because she's in a state of depression...

01:42:15.923 --> 01:42:19.551
...so depressed that my daughter flew
all the way from Seattle to be with her.

01:42:19.719 --> 01:42:21.720
And I feel lousy about that.

01:42:21.887 --> 01:42:26.016
I feel lousy about the pain
that I've caused my wife and my kids.

01:42:26.183 --> 01:42:28.101
I feel guilty and conscience-stricken...

01:42:28.269 --> 01:42:30.895
...and all of those things
that you think sentimental...

01:42:31.063 --> 01:42:35.025
...but which my generation
calls simple, human decency.

01:42:39.030 --> 01:42:41.072
And I miss my home...

01:42:41.782 --> 01:42:44.617
...because I'm beginning
to get scared shitless.

01:42:44.785 --> 01:42:48.246
Because all of a sudden it's closer
to the end than it is to the beginning.

01:42:48.414 --> 01:42:51.374
And death is suddenly
a perceptible thing to me...

...with definable features.

You're dealing with a man

By the first week in July...

01:44:21.090 --> 01:44:23.216
...the Howard Beale Show
was down 11 points.

01:44:23.384 --> 01:44:25.218

It was heavy, baby.
I saw the earth quake.

that you're a family man.

FRANK: Mr. Jensen was unhappy at the idea
of taking Howard Beale off the air.

01:52:56.438 --> 01:53:00.358
Mr. Jensen thinks Howard Beale
is bringing a very important message...

01:53:00.525 --> 01:53:02.944
...to the American people.

01:53:04.279 --> 01:53:07.865
So he wants Howard Beale on the air
and he wants him kept on.

01:53:10.118 --> 01:53:13.120
Mr. Jensen feels we're too catastrophic
in our thinking.

01:53:13.288 --> 01:53:17.458
I argued that television was a volatile
industry in which success and failure...

01:53:17.626 --> 01:53:20.211
...were determined week by week.

01:53:20.879 --> 01:53:24.382
Mr. Jensen said he did not like
volatile industries and suggested...

01:53:24.549 --> 01:53:28.052
...with a certain sinister silkiness...

01:53:28.929 --> 01:53:32.556
...that volatility in business
usually reflected bad management.

01:53:33.558 --> 01:53:36.811
He didn't care if Howard Beale
was the number-one show or the 50th.

01:53:36.979 --> 01:53:39.438
He didn't really care
if the Beale Show lost money.

He wants Howard Beale on the air

The Beale Show Q score's down to 33.

Most of this loss occurred in the child

considered judgment and mine...

...that if we get rid of Beale,

position on Beale as inflexible?

I suppose we'll have to kill him.

01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:31.926
I don't suppose you have any ideas
on that, Diana?

01:55:38.642 --> 01:55:41.685
Well, what would you fellows say
to an assassination?

01:55:43.188 --> 01:55:47.191
I think I can get the Mao Tse-Tung people
to kill Beale for us...

01:55:47.359 --> 01:55:48.526
...as one of their shows.

01:55:49.736 --> 01:55:54.198
In fact, it'll make a hell of a kickoff show
for the season.

01:55:54.366 --> 01:55:57.868
We're facing heavy opposition on the
other networks for Wednesday nights...

01:55:58.036 --> 01:56:01.455
...and The Mao Tse-Tung Hour
could use a sensational opener.

01:56:02.916 --> 01:56:06.710
It could be done right on camera in the studio.

01:56:08.380 --> 01:56:10.548
We ought to get
a fantastic look-in audience...

01:56:10.715 --> 01:56:14.677
...for the assassination
of Howard Beale as our opening show.

01:56:14.845 --> 01:56:19.557
MAN: Well, if Beale dies, what would
our continuing obligation...

01:56:19.724 --> 01:56:21.767
...to the Beale corporation be?

01:56:22.060 --> 01:56:24.895
I know our contract with Beale
contains a buy-out clause...

01:56:25.063 --> 01:56:27.189
...triggered by his death or incapacity.

01:56:27.357 --> 01:56:30.651
There must be a formula
for the computation of the purchase price.

01:56:30.819 --> 01:56:34.780
Offhand, I think it was based
on a multiple 1975 earnings...

01:56:34.990 --> 01:56:37.074
...with the base period in 1975.

01:56:37.492 --> 01:56:41.537
I think it was 50 percent of salary
plus 25 percent of the first year's profit...

01:56:41.705 --> 01:56:44.999
...multiplied by the unexpired portion
of the contract.

01:56:45.167 --> 01:56:48.127
I don't think the show has
any substantial syndication value...

01:56:48.295 --> 01:56:49.461
...would you say, Diana?

01:56:49.629 --> 01:56:51.338
Syndication profits are minimal.

01:56:52.674 --> 01:56:55.342
We're talking about a capital crime here.

01:56:56.469 --> 01:56:59.013
The network can't be implicated.

FRANK: Well, the issue is,
shall we kill Howard Beale or not?

01:57:18.909 --> 01:57:21.368
I'd like to hear some more opinions on that.

01:57:21.536 --> 01:57:24.955
I don't see we have any option, Frank.
