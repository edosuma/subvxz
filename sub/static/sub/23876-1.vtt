03:00.272 --> 03:02.374
I can give you
one hundred of these.

03:03.753 --> 03:06.573
-Why do I need these?
-To fight the Americans.

03:06.682 --> 03:08.620
We have a treaty
with the Americans.

03:08.718 --> 03:10.554
Lots of our people say that.

03:10.616 --> 03:13.038
Then the Americans make
belts with their skin.

03:13.093 --> 03:14.585
Is that what this man tells you?

03:14.632 --> 03:18.311
This was is the Americans'
excuse to seize Mohawk land.

03:19.046 --> 03:20.179
I promise you,

03:20.256 --> 03:22.436
my King extends a-a
chain of friendship,

03:22.476 --> 03:23.532
he doesn't want your lands.

03:23.603 --> 03:25.080
No, he wants us to die for him.

03:25.181 --> 03:26.564
You're already dying!

03:26.686 --> 03:30.341
Wentahawi, the Americans have
scalped 87 Mohawk this month.

03:30.427 --> 03:32.467
And they leave their bodies
to be eaten by the animals.

03:32.537 --> 03:33.889
That was far from here.

03:33.990 --> 03:36.826
They're at houses nearby
with at least 20 armed men.

03:37.004 --> 03:38.496
And more will come.

03:39.348 --> 03:40.481
Trust me.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.098
You have to stop them.

03:42.254 --> 03:43.871
Our people will never agree.

03:48.887 --> 03:50.330
We can ask Uncle, he'll listen.

03:50.839 --> 03:52.847
He's living at the
mission while he hunts.

03:53.018 --> 03:54.432
He won't be back for weeks.

03:54.674 --> 03:57.151
If he sides with King George,
the Mohawk will follow.

03:57.263 --> 03:59.177
More words from your white man.

03:59.263 --> 04:03.194
I have hunted with Calvin for
over three months, Wentahawi.

04:03.257 --> 04:04.991
He knows I am
a man of my word.

04:05.077 --> 04:08.905
Boys like Calvin will listen to
any man that promises him war!

04:09.024 --> 04:11.290
We must act or
the Americans will kill us!

04:11.345 --> 04:13.602
This Britisher only
wants to use your body

04:13.627 --> 04:16.329
to protect him from
American rifles.

04:16.798 --> 04:19.728
And to keep you
both warm at night.

04:30.409 --> 04:32.354
I would never harm Calvin.

04:33.520 --> 04:35.005
Or your daughter.

05:08.997 --> 05:10.536
How far have we come?

05:10.863 --> 05:13.502
Half our whiskey...
give or take.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.323
Sun is up.

05:16.542 --> 05:18.057
No sign of Calvin.

05:18.301 --> 05:19.614
He'll show up.

05:19.879 --> 05:21.895
You know he doesn't
like to sleep alone.

05:26.171 --> 05:28.327
My mother doesn't understand.

05:29.358 --> 05:32.093
-She's just cautious.
-She's scared.

05:35.959 --> 05:37.834
There's no room
for that anymore.

05:42.936 --> 05:44.569
I'm going to miss this.

05:49.273 --> 05:50.836
Then why leave?

05:53.914 --> 05:55.453
My father is a very
important man.

05:55.500 --> 05:57.564
He has plans for me there.

06:00.221 --> 06:03.182
But I will miss these
magical trees.

06:07.447 --> 06:09.189
What about me and Calvin?

06:12.682 --> 06:14.572
You must finish what we started.

06:19.722 --> 06:21.011
I have faith in you.

06:22.449 --> 06:23.566
And Calvin.

07:48.955 --> 07:51.049
I can't drink like you.

07:51.799 --> 07:53.252
No one can.

08:03.527 --> 08:04.871
Hm?

08:06.262 --> 08:08.511
-I have to tell you something.
-Shh.

08:09.736 --> 08:11.103
Someone's coming.

08:17.278 --> 08:18.559
Calvin.

08:22.383 --> 08:23.477
We need to move!

08:25.461 --> 08:26.805
I killed them.

08:26.969 --> 08:28.492
I killed them all.

08:31.515 --> 08:33.717
Jesus, that was
a last resort, Calvin.

08:40.505 --> 08:41.630
Oak!

08:42.263 --> 08:43.513
Where are you going?

08:43.621 --> 08:44.778
This is bad, Calvin.

08:44.824 --> 08:46.362
Someone has to stop
the big knives!

08:46.463 --> 08:47.792
You just showed you're
full of fear then.

08:47.854 --> 08:50.768
-You sound like your mother.
-I am nothing like my mother.

08:52.252 --> 08:53.869
I want the demons to
leave and I will fight

08:53.908 --> 08:57.064
but what you did, Calvin,
it was stupid!

08:59.088 --> 09:01.197
Now we have to get back and
tell the people we're at war.

09:01.244 --> 09:03.017
They'll have to support me.

09:04.462 --> 09:07.189
And if they don't, we go
upstream to find your uncle.

09:07.407 --> 09:08.923
Don't you speak for my family.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.437
Nothing will happen to them.
I promise.

09:11.491 --> 09:12.852
I had to do it, Oak.

09:12.931 --> 09:14.923
They're going to kill
us all if we don't fight.

09:15.079 --> 09:17.001
My mother's gonna kill us first.

09:40.364 --> 09:41.638
If your mother will
not support us,

09:41.701 --> 09:43.669
we need to get to your
uncle as soon as possible.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.091
How far is it to the mission?

09:52.180 --> 09:53.361
Oak?

09:56.462 --> 09:57.579
Calvin?

10:09.807 --> 10:10.971
Oak?

10:55.772 --> 10:57.303
Nice, ain't it?

10:58.029 --> 10:59.622
Whoa there, friend?

11:00.816 --> 11:02.293
My name's Myles.

11:02.810 --> 11:04.294
Myles Quincy Holt.

11:05.205 --> 11:08.400
Look, I didn't...
I didn't mean to frighten you.

11:12.879 --> 11:14.183
You uh...

11:15.488 --> 11:16.785
You got a name?

11:18.051 --> 11:20.043
-Joshua.
-Joshua.

11:24.209 --> 11:26.858
What the hell you doin'
out here, Joshua?

11:28.923 --> 11:30.243
This Indian land.

11:33.048 --> 11:34.290
I live here.

11:36.322 --> 11:38.079
Well, I'll be fucked.

11:38.822 --> 11:40.001
A white man...

11:41.180 --> 11:42.665
livin' out here.

11:44.840 --> 11:47.005
Jesus, ain't you afraid
of gettin' scalped?

11:47.097 --> 11:48.502
In my experience...

11:48.605 --> 11:50.621
it's the white man
who does the scalping.

11:53.730 --> 11:55.112
Ain't that the truth.

11:56.885 --> 11:59.064
You by any chance
know George McFeely?

11:59.244 --> 12:02.142
He's up in uh, Fort Niagara?

12:03.098 --> 12:06.763
Well, I heard he got
himself 30 Indian scalps.

12:07.857 --> 12:09.787
Can't say our paths
have crossed.

12:11.353 --> 12:12.993
Well, me and my men,

12:13.134 --> 12:14.993
we've been trackin' an Indian.

12:16.064 --> 12:17.884
You ain't seen one

12:18.033 --> 12:20.181
runnin' this way,
have you, Joshua?

12:21.251 --> 12:22.594
I haven't.

12:24.290 --> 12:26.157
How many men are you
traveling with?

12:27.430 --> 12:28.844
There's two of us.

12:29.357 --> 12:30.365
Oh.

12:34.253 --> 12:35.511
You just said men.

12:35.886 --> 12:36.925
No.

12:39.112 --> 12:40.636
I don't believe I did.

12:48.787 --> 12:50.420
It's just the two of you?

12:52.154 --> 12:53.537
Sure thing, friend.

12:56.335 --> 12:58.124
I-I have to be on my way.

12:58.327 --> 13:01.170
It's only my daddy,
he sure don't count.

13:01.436 --> 13:02.999
We're all Americans here.

13:03.452 --> 13:05.327
You tell your father
to stop moving.

13:05.475 --> 13:06.725
Daddy.

13:06.827 --> 13:09.038
You're making our new friend
here a little nervous.

13:12.016 --> 13:14.798
Colonel Charles Hawkes,
if you please.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.258
How many are you?

13:17.360 --> 13:19.422
I'm surprised that a uh,

13:19.602 --> 13:21.712
man of your perceived heritage

13:21.774 --> 13:24.954
would bear arms against
fellow patriots.

13:25.751 --> 13:28.172
While I am well aware that uh,

13:28.250 --> 13:31.735
far too many allegiances have
been tested this past year,

13:31.840 --> 13:35.317
I can find no viable circumstance

13:35.410 --> 13:37.652
in which a man would
raise his weapon

13:37.825 --> 13:39.778
against fellow Americans.

13:41.302 --> 13:43.997
I've been killin' British for years.

13:45.661 --> 13:47.466
This boy's a redcoat.

13:47.716 --> 13:49.317
He can't be, Colonel.

13:49.674 --> 13:52.025
You know redcoats
don't travel alone.

13:52.725 --> 13:54.576
You're not alone,

13:54.858 --> 13:57.069
are you, Joshua?

14:00.588 --> 14:02.557
He's travelin' with Indians!

14:02.921 --> 14:03.999
Don't!

14:20.164 --> 14:21.773
Flank him!

14:29.607 --> 14:30.536
They're over there!

14:31.060 --> 14:31.990
They're over there!

14:40.192 --> 14:41.551
We need to go!

14:42.637 --> 14:43.793
I almost got him!

15:09.659 --> 15:10.651
Get down.

15:18.447 --> 15:19.744
Over here.

15:23.013 --> 15:25.428
-D'you hear me?
-Yeah, I can hear you.

15:25.834 --> 15:28.771
Every timber nigger for a
hundred miles can hear you.

15:29.608 --> 15:30.818
You see anything?

15:31.491 --> 15:33.780
Nothin'. They must've
gone the other way.

16:35.226 --> 16:37.687
They were scouts.
The rest are coming.

16:37.789 --> 16:39.445
How? I killed them.

16:39.679 --> 16:40.898
Not all.

16:41.679 --> 16:43.843
Why do you act and
not use your mind?

16:44.375 --> 16:45.984
How far to the long house?

16:55.525 --> 16:56.713
Mission.

16:57.437 --> 16:59.390
We must be fast.

17:21.124 --> 17:21.983
Whoa!

17:42.173 --> 17:43.532
Wentahawi.

17:45.599 --> 17:47.231
Calvin has done a great thing.

17:47.271 --> 17:48.177
He set--

17:50.466 --> 17:51.997
This is your fault.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.841
You put this in their heads.

17:53.937 --> 17:55.421
You need to talk to the people.

17:55.476 --> 17:56.621
They're gone.

17:56.676 --> 17:59.187
-Gone? Gone where?
-Into hiding.

17:59.601 --> 18:02.039
Your father watched
the smoke all morning.

18:06.285 --> 18:09.817
Our people will not go to war!

18:09.941 --> 18:12.379
Go to the mission, get Uncle and
all the cousins, they'll help.

18:12.480 --> 18:14.011
It's too late for that.

18:14.206 --> 18:17.018
Wentahawi, the Mohawk
can no longer stay neutral.

18:17.112 --> 18:19.659
You must fight or you will die.

18:23.046 --> 18:25.289
No one should die
on such a lovely day.

18:27.104 --> 18:28.245
Say go.

18:28.760 --> 18:30.346
I come in peace.

18:32.060 --> 18:33.271
See?

18:35.951 --> 18:38.998
What are you doing so
far away from home?

18:40.738 --> 18:43.710
A great crime
was committed today

18:43.952 --> 18:45.164
against the big knives.

18:45.273 --> 18:47.969
These children had
nothing to do with it!

18:48.400 --> 18:50.439
Then why is your butt
covered in ash?

18:51.002 --> 18:52.439
Stay where you are!

18:55.078 --> 18:57.321
The great father in Washington

18:57.462 --> 19:01.548
wants to know if the Mohawk
are still his loyal children.

19:03.032 --> 19:04.970
Howdy, Joshua.

19:09.954 --> 19:12.244
Because of his actions last night,

19:12.361 --> 19:14.915
we must take the boy
to Fort George.

19:15.230 --> 19:16.996
I assure you,

19:17.167 --> 19:18.840
he will face a fair trial.

19:18.988 --> 19:20.637
I ain't no man's prisoner.

19:20.832 --> 19:22.848
This is not an invitation.

19:32.921 --> 19:34.156
Get ready.

19:34.281 --> 19:36.068
No...don't.

19:36.326 --> 19:37.482
Yancy!

19:37.576 --> 19:39.333
Tell these people
they are obstructing

19:39.412 --> 19:41.240
the United States government.

19:41.396 --> 19:44.404
This is not the way
good children behave!

19:44.670 --> 19:45.795
Um...

19:46.256 --> 19:49.842
I will drag that buck back
to Fort George by his teeth!

19:49.987 --> 19:51.964
There will be no
bloodshed, Captain!

19:52.073 --> 19:55.019
Then I question your fitness
to command, Colonel.

19:55.112 --> 19:56.831
That is mutiny!

19:56.972 --> 19:58.534
Find your uncle.

20:07.501 --> 20:10.335
Cease fire! Cease fire!

20:10.692 --> 20:11.692
Cease--

20:50.974 --> 20:52.545
Where's Yancy?

20:53.591 --> 20:55.099
Yancy!

20:55.670 --> 20:58.099
We no longer require
a translator.

20:58.513 --> 20:59.834
You're a soldier now.

21:00.006 --> 21:01.248
Act like one.

21:05.781 --> 21:07.187
I'm sorry, Captain.

21:08.835 --> 21:09.867
It's Colonel.

21:10.969 --> 21:13.070
I just received a promotion.

21:51.342 --> 21:52.756
They're close.

21:53.897 --> 21:55.490
Which way's the mission?

21:55.710 --> 21:58.123
Upriver, back the way we came.

21:58.436 --> 21:59.842
Ten miles.

22:00.063 --> 22:02.047
We can't just go straight
back through them.

22:03.371 --> 22:05.457
You two follow the ridge
up through the river.

22:06.318 --> 22:08.052
I'll double back and
lead them away.

22:11.483 --> 22:13.154
There's only one way.

22:48.279 --> 22:50.693
I won't let anything
happen to us.

23:01.052 --> 23:02.857
You two...

23:03.146 --> 23:04.826
are my family.

23:42.976 --> 23:44.781
They mean to kill me now.

24:14.807 --> 24:16.159
Got you.

24:24.176 --> 24:26.340
Beal, let's move!

24:26.504 --> 24:28.551
I-I don't like this, Captain.

24:29.448 --> 24:30.581
Colonel.

24:30.691 --> 24:32.292
We need to get to Fort George

24:32.339 --> 24:34.892
before what happened to Hawkes
happens to the rest o' us.

24:34.955 --> 24:38.486
We are advancin' with speed
after the enemy.

24:41.518 --> 24:43.361
Now, gentlemen,

24:43.557 --> 24:46.963
we are in a valley
surrounded by a ridge.

24:47.127 --> 24:49.338
These vermin have
limited options.

24:49.979 --> 24:51.916
To the north, there's a river.

24:52.416 --> 24:55.432
To the east, there's a war.

24:57.276 --> 24:58.674
They're headin' west.

24:59.250 --> 25:00.987
So we are headed west.

25:01.102 --> 25:02.321
I'm with Beal.

25:02.477 --> 25:04.758
Fort George sounds
like the right idea.

25:05.063 --> 25:06.563
You don't have a say.

25:06.875 --> 25:08.852
This is Mohawk land.

25:09.157 --> 25:10.782
We're in <i>their</i> house.

25:10.836 --> 25:13.226
We are in the United States
of America.

25:13.359 --> 25:15.094
Then that means we have a vote.

25:15.149 --> 25:16.648
Shut your boom box.

25:18.117 --> 25:20.461
I vote for Fort George.

25:24.321 --> 25:26.032
Gentlemen, you know me.

25:27.899 --> 25:31.211
So you know I will do
what needs to be done.

25:33.509 --> 25:35.344
And I promise you...

25:35.783 --> 25:37.744
I will get you through this safe.

25:38.226 --> 25:41.844
But you have best
lower those hands...

25:42.320 --> 25:44.265
before I tear 'em off.

25:52.791 --> 25:54.455
This is bad bread.

25:54.556 --> 25:56.517
We're retrieving a prisoner.

25:57.899 --> 25:59.274
Nothin' more.

27:01.243 --> 27:02.844
Leash this dog.

27:06.899 --> 27:08.375
God damn!

27:16.134 --> 27:17.844
I'll keep you like that.

27:41.152 --> 27:42.751
Where are they, redskin?

27:44.259 --> 27:45.259
Hm?

27:45.652 --> 27:47.355
Where's that squaw?

27:47.707 --> 27:49.417
And the redcoat?

28:23.373 --> 28:26.060
Don't make me look for
your tongue myself.

28:26.499 --> 28:27.311
Huh?

28:32.371 --> 28:34.137
Maybe he doesn't understand.

28:41.841 --> 28:43.552
Ask him...

28:43.661 --> 28:46.286
where that squaw
and redcoat are.

28:46.453 --> 28:48.913
Um, the Mohawk are

28:49.038 --> 28:51.500
dirty dealers, liars.

28:51.625 --> 28:52.710
They're cannibals.

28:52.875 --> 28:54.346
Ask him!

29:26.725 --> 29:29.373
Where is your squaw?

29:33.273 --> 29:35.023
Aren't you worried about her?

29:35.367 --> 29:37.890
Being out here on
the woods all alone?

29:39.534 --> 29:40.628
No.

29:42.831 --> 29:44.393
But you should be.

29:47.268 --> 29:49.901
I knew there was
a tongue in there.

29:51.713 --> 29:53.752
She'll bring everyone!

30:04.170 --> 30:06.435
If that squaw fetches
more Indians...

30:07.604 --> 30:10.705
Father, we best get back to Fort
George real quick, all right?

30:10.904 --> 30:14.935
You know, colonel or not, Holt,
you are one dumb sumbitch.

30:15.107 --> 30:16.927
We need to get outta here

30:17.046 --> 30:19.812
double fast before a
whole mess of redskins

30:19.945 --> 30:22.250
come down and
scalp the lot of us.

30:23.574 --> 30:25.058
So uh,

30:25.128 --> 30:27.808
you want to hold a
blood-thirsty red devil's

30:27.885 --> 30:29.793
hands all the way
to Fort George?

30:30.412 --> 30:33.740
We got a lead on 'em,
I say we march to the fort.

30:34.193 --> 30:35.795
It's two days.

30:37.467 --> 30:38.974
Come tonight...

30:39.428 --> 30:42.584
these woods are gonna
become a butcher's yard.

30:45.208 --> 30:48.599
Capturing them two is the only
way to ensure our survival.

30:51.841 --> 30:54.216
So, uh, how we gonna
catch up to 'em?

30:57.419 --> 30:58.677
We aren't.

31:02.641 --> 31:04.156
They'll come to us.

31:18.501 --> 31:20.080
What...w-we need to go back.

31:20.158 --> 31:23.072
We'll go to him.
He would've died for us.

31:31.835 --> 31:33.780
He would not want us to go back.

32:34.339 --> 32:35.980
He ain't gonna talk.

32:36.450 --> 32:37.904
He doesn't have to.

32:39.029 --> 32:40.615
He just has to sing.

32:41.283 --> 32:43.439
His pals will come to the dance.

33:01.390 --> 33:02.968
Open his mouth.

33:24.613 --> 33:25.887
You go ahead.

33:26.598 --> 33:27.895
You do it better.

33:40.872 --> 33:42.184
Go on, boy.

33:42.739 --> 33:44.137
Make him sing.

33:46.265 --> 33:48.797
We... wait...

33:50.729 --> 33:53.619
I mean, w-we aren't supposed to
torture these Indians, are we?

33:53.752 --> 33:56.065
You see President Madison here?

33:56.291 --> 33:57.026
Huh?

33:57.705 --> 34:01.416
The only person in power
in these parts is your daddy.

34:01.515 --> 34:03.601
He's our goddamn president.

34:21.830 --> 34:23.759
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

34:26.627 --> 34:28.056
Are you my boy?

34:29.512 --> 34:31.081
Are you my son?

35:03.528 --> 35:06.325
You're a damn fine
conductor, Myles.

35:23.456 --> 35:24.729
Get him!

35:42.275 --> 35:43.689
Please don't hurt me.

36:15.575 --> 36:17.216
Please go away.

36:20.324 --> 36:21.737
You will not shoot me.

36:22.544 --> 36:23.755
I will.

36:26.216 --> 36:28.466
-I'm unarmed.
-I don't care.

36:31.114 --> 36:32.606
I'm with child.

36:46.525 --> 36:47.571
Run!

36:54.875 --> 36:56.664
Goddamn shitfire!

37:07.536 --> 37:09.529
Pushed the goddamn boy around!

37:13.028 --> 37:16.910
What's the matter with you?
Huh? You see a chipmunk?

37:18.973 --> 37:20.755
What the hell is this?

37:21.778 --> 37:23.942
Couldn't bear to listen
to him choke anymore.

37:29.020 --> 37:30.528
Where are you going?

37:31.223 --> 37:33.458
You got an appointment
with King George?

37:35.692 --> 37:37.012
Hey, Indian.

37:38.825 --> 37:40.341
My boy is dead.

37:43.286 --> 37:44.466
Dead!

37:47.598 --> 37:49.325
Shut him up, Beal.

38:27.721 --> 38:30.183
Why the hell did you
come here, boy?

38:35.268 --> 38:37.886
Why'd I let these woods
eat you up?

38:41.935 --> 38:43.123
My boy.

39:27.624 --> 39:29.772
You smell like Indian, Lachlan.

39:30.007 --> 39:32.030
Still smell better than you.

39:32.552 --> 39:35.286
I guess I'll just have to
rely on my looks then.

39:35.403 --> 39:37.380
Yeah, got you beat
there too, Beal.

39:38.620 --> 39:40.903
A woman's taste
might surprise you.

39:43.863 --> 39:46.089
What about you, fancy Dan?

39:46.245 --> 39:47.206
Pardon?

39:47.480 --> 39:50.238
Where the hell did you learn
to speak Indian like that?

39:50.897 --> 39:52.069
And, uh,

39:52.272 --> 39:55.686
what's this little
nonsense all about? Huh?

39:55.870 --> 39:57.159
The Founding Fathers

39:57.228 --> 39:59.698
wanted us to be able to
communicate with the savages.

40:00.627 --> 40:01.854
And to look proper.

40:01.916 --> 40:02.901
Well.

40:02.991 --> 40:04.701
They shoulda learned
to talk English.

40:04.780 --> 40:06.366
Shitfire, Beal, they do.

40:06.428 --> 40:07.905
You were just talking
to one of them.

40:08.069 --> 40:09.186
Excuse me.

40:12.866 --> 40:14.295
I'm tryin' to...

40:14.514 --> 40:17.381
to wash the blood of
my boy off my body.

40:20.714 --> 40:23.698
If you cannot give me
a moment of peace...

40:26.753 --> 40:27.808
Uh...

40:31.112 --> 40:33.347
I'll slash your tongues
out of your mouth.

40:46.171 --> 40:47.499
I'm sorry, Colonel.

40:48.460 --> 40:50.530
Myles was a good boy.

40:57.178 --> 40:58.951
Two heroes died today.

41:01.123 --> 41:03.264
I know how you felt
about the Colonel.

42:14.713 --> 42:15.783
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

42:15.862 --> 42:17.557
Oh, goddammit!

42:18.168 --> 42:19.504
So you hear anything?

42:19.669 --> 42:21.926
Well, I can't hear shit
if you keep talkin' at me.

42:23.426 --> 42:26.231
You know what these Indians
are gonna do if they find us?

42:26.294 --> 42:27.192
Hm?

42:27.341 --> 42:29.949
The ones last night, they
were the lucky ones.

42:30.184 --> 42:31.186
All right?

42:31.288 --> 42:34.498
You've studied Mohawk, you should
know better than any of us.

42:34.950 --> 42:36.450
They don't want prisoners.

42:36.669 --> 42:37.981
They want blood.

42:41.933 --> 42:43.004
Colonel?

42:43.175 --> 42:46.215
We've got to get out of here. We
gotta get back to Fort George.

42:46.447 --> 42:47.579
Please?

42:48.158 --> 42:50.877
Because they are...maneaters.

42:50.923 --> 42:51.930
Shh.

42:51.969 --> 42:53.540
They will gnaw our bones!

42:53.657 --> 42:56.064
You need to pull yourself
together, soldier.

42:57.400 --> 43:00.540
Unless I personally place
you in the ground

43:00.611 --> 43:01.853
with my bare hands.

43:01.946 --> 43:04.892
Now, Beal, you're a tracker, right?

43:05.264 --> 43:06.670
You can't track?

43:07.146 --> 43:08.990
You've been leading
us around these woods

43:09.052 --> 43:11.381
-in circles and I don't know what...
-Colonel.

43:18.342 --> 43:19.920
You earn your pay.

44:07.757 --> 44:09.713
That's big enough for a bear.

44:09.847 --> 44:12.144
Well, that means it's big
enough for an Indian.

44:13.347 --> 44:15.011
Forces telling
us something.

44:15.621 --> 44:17.136
They're nearby.

44:17.418 --> 44:18.933
And they don't
have many options.

44:34.787 --> 44:36.060
It's fresh dug.

44:36.427 --> 44:38.260
It could be a couple of rats.

44:40.526 --> 44:42.261
Only one way to find out.

44:43.870 --> 44:44.948
Mm-hmm.

44:57.822 --> 44:59.361
Me? No.

45:00.243 --> 45:01.345
Oh, no.

45:01.525 --> 45:03.102
The giant's too big.

45:03.770 --> 45:05.437
I'm ranking, so.

45:05.691 --> 45:06.895
What about Beal?

45:07.109 --> 45:08.180
Uh-uh.

45:09.688 --> 45:10.961
I like Beal.

45:20.574 --> 45:21.933
Do you mind?

45:23.732 --> 45:24.912
Thank you.

46:10.723 --> 46:12.090
See anything?

46:13.184 --> 46:14.442
Nothing!

46:20.997 --> 46:22.521
Can you hear anything?

46:23.802 --> 46:26.310
Why don't you drag your ass in
here and look for yourself?

47:05.142 --> 47:06.346
Get him out of there!

47:18.862 --> 47:19.885
Come on!

47:24.276 --> 47:25.760
Get me out of here!

47:28.848 --> 47:29.816
Get him!

47:30.395 --> 47:31.567
They're in there!

47:31.910 --> 47:33.707
-They're in there!
-Is it both of them?

47:33.793 --> 47:36.004
I don't know but I am not
going back in there.

47:38.371 --> 47:39.855
We know you're in there!

47:44.044 --> 47:45.271
Get out of my way.

47:45.536 --> 47:46.396
Move.

47:46.880 --> 47:47.872
All right.

47:50.325 --> 47:52.232
Gather us up some green wood.

47:52.974 --> 47:54.482
We're gonna smoke 'em out.

48:15.649 --> 48:17.485
We need to find fresh air.

48:31.485 --> 48:32.805
It's too narrow.

48:40.219 --> 48:41.727
You were leaving.

48:42.808 --> 48:44.441
So I didn't tell you.

48:45.590 --> 48:46.777
Tell me what?

48:49.031 --> 48:50.554
About the future.

48:54.274 --> 48:56.406
I don't think there
is a future anymore.

48:58.735 --> 49:00.610
I'm having a child.

49:06.047 --> 49:09.188
-How far along?
-Two months.

49:11.382 --> 49:13.280
I-Is it Calvin's?

49:17.655 --> 49:18.671
Mine?

49:42.354 --> 49:43.893
There is a future.

49:45.028 --> 49:46.020
Dig!

50:05.524 --> 50:08.345
They must be smokey as a
pair of hams in there.

50:08.860 --> 50:10.157
Hello!

50:13.238 --> 50:14.535
They ain't in there.

50:14.652 --> 50:17.105
What? You think they
magicked their way out?

50:20.292 --> 50:21.730
Goddammit!

50:24.644 --> 50:26.496
Ah, shitfire!

50:26.722 --> 50:28.996
Maybe we are chasin' rats.

50:36.177 --> 50:38.990
Only place for 20
miles is the mission.

50:44.831 --> 50:46.018
Let's go.

52:02.824 --> 52:05.051
The mission's upriver, we'll
make better time in the canoe.

52:05.153 --> 52:06.817
I don't have anything to trade.

52:08.306 --> 52:09.782
Oak, wait.

52:20.818 --> 52:22.842
There's no cause
for alarm, friend.

52:24.813 --> 52:26.688
<i>Do you speak English?</i>

52:27.375 --> 52:28.227
No.

52:28.852 --> 52:29.828
Here.

52:31.377 --> 52:32.604
-Here.
-Whoa.

52:32.682 --> 52:36.275
No... <i>for trade.</i>

52:36.741 --> 52:39.241
<i>For the canoe.</i>

52:52.329 --> 52:54.462
You don't understand...
for you.

52:54.610 --> 52:55.727
Trade.

52:58.774 --> 52:59.704
Here.

52:59.931 --> 53:01.509
Here, j-just take it!

53:42.298 --> 53:44.079
I've never killed anyone before.

53:47.354 --> 53:48.721
Neither had Calvin.

53:50.609 --> 53:52.351
A great warrior.

53:55.234 --> 53:57.140
We should be there
before sundown.

53:58.538 --> 54:00.507
We'll feel better in the
dark than the Americans.

54:00.609 --> 54:02.367
On the forest.

54:04.288 --> 54:07.429
When there's too much death,
the blood seeps into the ground.

54:07.593 --> 54:09.265
Soaks into the roots.

54:10.712 --> 54:12.378
The trees can't sleep.

54:14.413 --> 54:16.483
And the forest goes mad.

54:53.388 --> 54:54.341
Oak.

54:55.161 --> 54:56.622
Oak, wake up.

54:58.802 --> 54:59.747
Look.

55:00.435 --> 55:01.591
We're here.

55:33.903 --> 55:35.895
How many people are
supposed to be here?

55:36.982 --> 55:38.201
Twelve maybe.

55:38.685 --> 55:41.755
My uncle, his cousins.
Two of them.

55:45.826 --> 55:47.271
They're very quiet.

56:22.474 --> 56:23.920
Where is everyone?

58:09.806 --> 58:11.111
My God.

58:28.125 --> 58:29.125
Is it...?

58:29.351 --> 58:30.476
My uncle.

58:31.515 --> 58:33.015
And my cousins.

58:34.339 --> 58:35.660
I did this.

58:36.495 --> 58:39.042
All this murder, all this blood,
it's all because of me.

58:39.144 --> 58:40.019
No.

58:40.124 --> 58:41.327
Where are the other
missionaries?

58:41.436 --> 58:42.983
He must've fled which
is what we need to do.

58:43.100 --> 58:44.147
We need to bury them.

58:44.194 --> 58:46.827
No, what we need to do
is hurry. We need to go.

58:51.557 --> 58:53.518
Too late for that, redskin.

59:46.274 --> 59:47.445
He's no good dead.

59:47.516 --> 59:48.578
Burn in hell!

59:48.666 --> 59:53.150
Oh, you got some fire
in you, redcoat. I like that!

59:53.871 --> 59:56.144
I... I'll kill you!

01:00:01.629 --> 01:00:04.543
At Fort George, I will
inform the General...

01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:09.084
that after murdering a platoon
of sleeping Americans,

01:00:09.279 --> 01:00:12.810
these savages executed my son

01:00:13.287 --> 01:00:15.748
and fled to a nearby mission

01:00:16.045 --> 01:00:17.552
where they were killed in battle.

01:00:17.623 --> 01:00:20.998
This man is a prisoner of the
United States of America

01:00:21.076 --> 01:00:23.466
and we're taking him
back as a prisoner.

01:00:23.623 --> 01:00:26.638
This man is a murdering
blue-eyed Indian.

01:00:26.739 --> 01:00:28.654
He is a British officer.

01:00:28.755 --> 01:00:31.224
They get ransomed,
we get a bonus.

01:00:31.286 --> 01:00:33.466
Rules of engagement, rusty guts.

01:00:33.623 --> 01:00:37.052
I'd just as soon splatter him
across this courtyard myself.

01:00:37.170 --> 01:00:38.794
But we've come this far.

01:00:38.912 --> 01:00:40.568
I want that money.

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:47.958
Come on, redcoat. Come on!

01:00:48.795 --> 01:00:50.201
You've come here for what?

01:00:50.482 --> 01:00:51.974
For the slaughter?

01:00:53.413 --> 01:00:55.495
They'll burn this new world to the ground!

01:00:56.050 --> 01:00:58.886
I would love just a
minute with your general.

01:00:59.058 --> 01:01:01.069
The stories I will
tell him about you

01:01:01.163 --> 01:01:04.015
will make him weep for
the future of this country--

01:01:07.288 --> 01:01:08.444
Colonel!

01:01:12.179 --> 01:01:13.944
The prisoner is all yours.

01:01:23.473 --> 01:01:24.888
I'm sorry, red.

01:01:26.795 --> 01:01:28.185
You put up a good fight.

01:01:30.419 --> 01:01:31.458
Jesus!

01:01:49.225 --> 01:01:52.092
Shh... shh...

01:02:11.209 --> 01:02:13.505
God damn, Beal.

01:02:15.318 --> 01:02:16.747
I liked you.

01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:27.633
You murder us in our sleep.

01:02:29.687 --> 01:02:31.843
You feign neutrality.

01:02:34.187 --> 01:02:35.828
Then you stab us in the back.

01:02:39.651 --> 01:02:41.432
So, if I were to allow...

01:02:41.885 --> 01:02:45.471
by action or inaction

01:02:46.612 --> 01:02:48.448
one more of your kind

01:02:49.355 --> 01:02:51.222
to kill one more white man,

01:02:53.244 --> 01:02:56.159
I could not face my
Lord on judgment day.

01:03:16.592 --> 01:03:18.675
The fortunes of war, death.

01:03:21.861 --> 01:03:23.642
Now we make for Fort George.

01:03:26.384 --> 01:03:29.082
This is not a healthy
place to linger.

01:03:37.631 --> 01:03:39.162
She told me she was pregnant.

01:03:57.779 --> 01:03:58.958
I'm sorry.

01:04:58.522 --> 01:05:00.068
Setting camp up soon?

01:05:01.264 --> 01:05:02.436
Why?

01:05:02.975 --> 01:05:06.123
All due respect, Colonel,
it's been a long day.

01:05:08.615 --> 01:05:10.725
Sixty miles to Fort George.

01:05:12.342 --> 01:05:13.459
Keep up.

01:05:15.451 --> 01:05:17.100
What about other Indians?

01:05:18.295 --> 01:05:19.709
We killed 'em all.

01:05:20.904 --> 01:05:22.419
There's other tribes.

01:05:26.881 --> 01:05:27.920
We killed them.

01:05:29.092 --> 01:05:30.131
All.

01:05:31.583 --> 01:05:33.504
What if the redcoats
are creepin' on us?

01:05:33.566 --> 01:05:35.284
The one and only redcoat
around these parts

01:05:35.355 --> 01:05:37.433
ain't creepin' up on anybody.

01:05:37.661 --> 01:05:38.942
What if there's more?

01:05:39.653 --> 01:05:42.809
"What if there's Indians?
What if there's redcoats?"

01:05:43.195 --> 01:05:46.367
What if there's a goddamn demon
rising up from the pits of hell?

01:05:46.438 --> 01:05:48.102
We killed them all!
They're dead!

01:05:51.776 --> 01:05:53.753
We're the only monsters
left out here.

01:06:38.361 --> 01:06:39.424
Oak.

01:06:43.692 --> 01:06:44.794
Oak.

01:06:47.074 --> 01:06:48.144
Wake up.

01:09:10.830 --> 01:09:12.103
Don't say it.

01:09:15.689 --> 01:09:17.392
We should've been
going the other way.

01:09:19.481 --> 01:09:20.879
This is worse!

01:09:21.292 --> 01:09:23.394
We should've burned it all down
and turn it all into field

01:09:23.441 --> 01:09:25.785
so a man can see
the buzzard a-rising!

01:09:28.649 --> 01:09:30.103
Where are you going?

01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:37.212
I'm going up that ridge.

01:09:37.852 --> 01:09:39.563
Figure out where
the hell we are.

01:10:45.476 --> 01:10:46.678
Holt!

01:10:47.843 --> 01:10:49.304
Colonel!

01:10:50.827 --> 01:10:54.257
-Holt!
-You gotta slow down!

01:10:55.576 --> 01:10:56.873
Hello?

01:11:07.428 --> 01:11:09.639
He's not waiting
for us, you know.

01:11:11.225 --> 01:11:12.834
He's going to leave us.

01:11:13.056 --> 01:11:15.220
No, he won't. He won't.

01:11:17.525 --> 01:11:20.291
That man is Lucifer in the flesh!

01:11:34.496 --> 01:11:36.379
Yancy!

01:11:38.879 --> 01:11:40.746
Where you at, fella?!

01:11:42.019 --> 01:11:43.418
Yancy!

01:12:01.825 --> 01:12:04.114
The hell you doin'?

01:12:04.552 --> 01:12:07.388
There's a devil in these woods!

01:12:09.217 --> 01:12:10.998
The devil's in these woods, boy?

01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:12.702
Hell fire!

01:12:14.647 --> 01:12:16.506
The devil shares my name.

01:12:22.037 --> 01:12:23.186
Where's Yancy?

01:12:24.272 --> 01:12:25.569
I don't...

01:12:25.748 --> 01:12:27.264
Fuck him.

01:12:30.224 --> 01:12:31.748
Keep the mountains on the left.

01:12:32.686 --> 01:12:35.006
-Home in two days.
-W-We can't.

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:37.608
We can't go deeper, Colonel.
We can't.

01:12:39.061 --> 01:12:40.811
We're gonna get to that ridge.

01:12:41.483 --> 01:12:43.584
We're gonna re-orient ourself.

01:12:44.139 --> 01:12:46.248
We're gonna go to the next ridge,
and the next ridge,

01:12:46.318 --> 01:12:49.013
and the next ridge
after that if we have to.

01:12:49.201 --> 01:12:50.256
Yes, sir.

01:12:55.514 --> 01:12:57.076
God will be with us, boy.

01:12:57.522 --> 01:12:58.552
Yes, sir.

01:13:13.713 --> 01:13:15.073
No resting.

01:13:27.256 --> 01:13:28.717
Yes, sir.

01:14:12.922 --> 01:14:14.195
Private?

01:14:16.461 --> 01:14:19.134
Yancy. Thank God, man.

01:14:19.314 --> 01:14:21.023
I thought we lost you, Yancy.

01:14:57.272 --> 01:14:58.514
Jesus.

01:15:07.597 --> 01:15:08.768
Help!

01:15:09.019 --> 01:15:10.346
Help!

01:15:10.487 --> 01:15:11.839
-Private!
-Help!

01:15:18.142 --> 01:15:19.658
Damn, you're in a trap.

01:15:22.446 --> 01:15:24.110
-No!
-Toward me.

01:15:28.279 --> 01:15:30.662
Shh, shh, you're all right.
You're all right.

01:15:32.951 --> 01:15:34.865
-You feet this?
-No. No.

01:15:34.990 --> 01:15:36.490
-No. No.
-Good.

01:15:36.716 --> 01:15:37.826
Bite this.

01:15:38.443 --> 01:15:39.717
Bite on that!

01:15:44.344 --> 01:15:46.344
That's all. Yeah.

01:15:47.304 --> 01:15:49.164
Doctor'll take that off as
soon as we get back to camp.

01:15:49.218 --> 01:15:51.703
No one takes my fucking leg!

01:15:51.914 --> 01:15:53.890
It's barely hangin' on
as it is, boy.

01:15:54.046 --> 01:15:56.952
I have not worn this
brace since Tippecanoe

01:15:57.037 --> 01:16:00.265
so some Mohawk squaw
could take my leg.

01:16:00.298 --> 01:16:02.791
Here, I-I got some laudanum.

01:16:02.838 --> 01:16:05.564
Now, here, open up.
Take that down, all of it.

01:16:07.198 --> 01:16:08.229
Yeah, yeah.

01:16:08.299 --> 01:16:09.639
Don't worry about that squaw.

01:16:09.717 --> 01:16:11.163
We killed that squaw.

01:16:11.295 --> 01:16:14.053
And she's burning in the
fiery pits of hell.

01:16:14.803 --> 01:16:16.553
I cannot walk.

01:16:16.764 --> 01:16:17.749
What?

01:16:17.818 --> 01:16:20.716
I cannot walk!

01:16:22.858 --> 01:16:24.093
I...

01:16:24.343 --> 01:16:25.858
can't walk,

01:16:26.288 --> 01:16:27.397
Colonel.

01:16:30.621 --> 01:16:31.660
Colonel.

01:16:31.855 --> 01:16:32.730
Yes.

01:16:32.824 --> 01:16:35.137
You can.

01:16:47.427 --> 01:16:48.755
I am ready...

01:16:49.677 --> 01:16:50.872
to walk.

01:16:51.675 --> 01:16:53.519
-Colonel.
-Yeah.

01:17:20.467 --> 01:17:21.663
Getting tired now.

01:17:24.635 --> 01:17:26.932
We're gonna have to find
a better vantage point.

01:17:32.385 --> 01:17:33.596
Lachlan?

01:17:38.049 --> 01:17:40.487
-Lachlan?
-Colonel.

01:17:41.312 --> 01:17:43.415
We gotta get up to that
hilltop over there and

01:17:43.516 --> 01:17:45.039
get our bearings.

01:17:47.477 --> 01:17:49.797
Ain't no bears back
here, Colonel.

01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:51.625
If you want to rest,

01:17:53.321 --> 01:17:55.610
I'll be finding your
bones here next summer.

01:18:02.138 --> 01:18:03.419
Lachlan?

01:18:10.816 --> 01:18:11.901
La--

01:18:42.745 --> 01:18:43.713
How'd you...?

01:18:43.870 --> 01:18:46.112
She ain't lettin' us go home.

01:18:47.190 --> 01:18:48.198
Private...

01:18:49.706 --> 01:18:50.948
I will leave you.

01:18:51.219 --> 01:18:52.988
We should have never

01:18:53.151 --> 01:18:56.104
ever come here.

01:19:02.627 --> 01:19:03.557
No.

01:19:27.859 --> 01:19:29.186
Come on.

01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:32.195
Ghost.

01:19:37.814 --> 01:19:39.486
You won't stop it!

01:19:40.415 --> 01:19:41.438
Indians!

01:19:44.657 --> 01:19:45.985
Won't stop us!

01:19:48.431 --> 01:19:49.516
Redcoats...

01:19:51.345 --> 01:19:52.696
couldn't stop us!

01:19:56.290 --> 01:19:57.345
French?

01:19:59.165 --> 01:20:00.798
Try and stop us.

01:20:02.212 --> 01:20:03.368
Ghosts.

01:20:03.595 --> 01:20:06.470
They sure as hell
are not gonna stop me!

01:20:46.150 --> 01:20:47.157
No.

01:20:52.338 --> 01:20:53.385
No.

01:20:54.182 --> 01:20:55.478
This isn't right.

01:23:22.632 --> 01:23:25.655
You killed twenty-two

01:23:25.811 --> 01:23:28.359
American patriots
in their sleep.

01:23:33.093 --> 01:23:34.913
Those were militia boys.

01:23:36.249 --> 01:23:37.648
Farming kids.

01:23:39.656 --> 01:23:41.452
This one's name was Orson.

01:23:43.741 --> 01:23:45.944
The one beyond was
his brother Presley.

01:23:47.062 --> 01:23:49.476
Last week, he'd come
to me and said,

01:23:50.351 --> 01:23:52.077
he was afraid of the dark.

01:23:55.851 --> 01:23:58.484
So I told him he could
sleep next to his brother.

01:24:08.272 --> 01:24:10.218
Your lover

01:24:10.671 --> 01:24:13.445
crept into my camp

01:24:14.281 --> 01:24:16.835
and burnt these boys
in their sleep.

01:24:21.648 --> 01:24:25.117
How dare you bring me back here.

01:24:28.570 --> 01:24:31.937
How dare you show me this again.

01:26:02.756 --> 01:26:04.405
You're no better than us.

01:26:57.799 --> 01:27:00.861
For years, we've been
fighting like this.

01:27:01.658 --> 01:27:03.103
Back and forth.

01:27:03.486 --> 01:27:04.939
You kill us...

01:27:05.314 --> 01:27:06.869
we kill you.

01:27:08.486 --> 01:27:09.798
It never ends.

01:27:10.330 --> 01:27:13.807
One of us will be wiped
off of this earth.

01:27:13.939 --> 01:27:17.306
And I do not intend for
that to be the white man.

01:27:18.736 --> 01:27:20.173
This is our home.

01:27:20.486 --> 01:27:22.736
Then your home will burn.

01:27:23.746 --> 01:27:25.988
Just like you burned mine.
