WEBVTT

00:02.125 --> 00:03.583
CHIEF:

00:02.125 --> 00:03.583
If the apple is ripe,

00:03.709 --> 00:05.208
give it a gentle twist,

00:05.333 --> 00:07.291
and it'll drop right

00:05.333 --> 00:07.291
into your hand.

00:09.792 --> 00:13.333
Mm-mm. Nature's candy.

00:13.458 --> 00:15.625
Allow me to gather from the

00:13.458 --> 00:15.625
tallest branches for you, sir.

00:15.750 --> 00:17.959
Gentle...twist!

00:18.083 --> 00:20.291
Hm. Your technique

00:18.083 --> 00:20.291
appears flawed.

00:20.417 --> 00:22.792
Well, applesauce

00:20.417 --> 00:22.792
is delicious too.

00:29.667 --> 00:32.083
Since when are there

00:29.667 --> 00:32.083
flying fruit pickers

00:32.208 --> 00:34.542
on Griffin Rock, Dad?

00:32.208 --> 00:34.542
News to me.

00:44.834 --> 00:47.083
Chase, vehicle mode.

00:54.959 --> 00:57.083
( baby crying )

01:01.208 --> 01:02.834
Oh, we're gettin' in on that.

01:08.625 --> 01:11.458
Here you go, Billy.

01:08.625 --> 01:11.458
Aah!

01:13.417 --> 01:14.625
Mr. Alper!

01:14.750 --> 01:16.709

We'll take Mr. Alper.

02:12.792 --> 02:17.166
Go swat down that flying pest!

02:20.583 --> 02:23.041
Graham, Dani, we're chasing

02:20.583 --> 02:23.041
an airborne fruit picker

02:23.166 --> 02:25.041
west on Lake.

02:23.166 --> 02:25.041
GRAHAM:  Of course you are.

02:25.166 --> 02:26.375
DANI:

02:25.166 --> 02:26.375
Be there in a jiff.

02:28.250 --> 02:30.250
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

02:38.166 --> 02:39.417
Ugh!

02:43.583 --> 02:47.917
Ugh, fertilizer. Maybe we can

02:43.583 --> 02:47.917
get Blades to clean this up.

02:48.041 --> 02:49.709
He is wearing his Scoop Claw.

02:49.834 --> 02:53.333
Sorry, boys. The Scoop Claw

02:49.834 --> 02:53.333
is unavailable starting in...

02:53.458 --> 02:56.709
three, two...

02:53.458 --> 02:56.709
BLADES: One!

02:59.667 --> 03:00.834
We've hit a snag!

03:00.959 --> 03:02.667
Detach, hurry!

03:08.917 --> 03:11.625
Step out calmly

03:08.917 --> 03:11.625
with your servos in the air.

03:11.750 --> 03:13.375
PRISCILLA:

03:11.750 --> 03:13.375
Hello!

03:13.500 --> 03:15.667
My Hover-Picker

03:13.500 --> 03:15.667
better not be damaged,

03:15.792 --> 03:18.250
or you'll be hearing

03:15.792 --> 03:18.250
from my mother's attorney.

03:22.417 --> 03:24.583
Priscilla,

03:22.417 --> 03:24.583
this thing is yours?

03:24.709 --> 03:27.542
Ah, if you're referring

03:24.709 --> 03:27.542
to my soon-to-be

03:27.667 --> 03:30.458
award-winning

03:27.667 --> 03:30.458
contest entry, yes.

03:30.583 --> 03:32.792
What contest?

03:30.583 --> 03:32.792
Pickpocket of the Year?

03:32.917 --> 03:34.875
The New Youth Invention

03:32.917 --> 03:34.875
competition,

03:35.333 --> 03:38.333
hosted by our close

03:35.333 --> 03:38.333
family friend, the mayor.

03:38.458 --> 03:42.250
Well, try keeping your little

03:38.458 --> 03:42.250
troublemaker on a shorter leash,

03:42.375 --> 03:43.750
won't you, Miss Pynch?

03:43.875 --> 03:46.000
You're not asking me

03:43.875 --> 03:46.000
to stunt the growth

03:46.125 --> 03:50.250
of life-changing technology,

03:46.125 --> 03:50.250
are you, Chief Burns?

03:50.375 --> 03:52.291
Wouldn't dream of it.

03:54.875 --> 03:58.250
See you at the contest, Cody.

03:58.375 --> 04:02.250
Unless you and Frankie couldn't

03:58.375 --> 04:02.250
come up with anything. Ha, ha.

04:02.375 --> 04:05.667
Don't worry about us,

04:02.375 --> 04:05.667
we have loads of ideas!

04:08.125 --> 04:09.125
Frankie, we need ideas!

04:09.250 --> 04:10.959
Now you're in a hurry?

04:11.083 --> 04:13.875
I've been trying to brainstorm

04:11.083 --> 04:13.875
with you for three weeks.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.583
I've had school. And chores.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.583
And renegade farm equipment.

04:17.709 --> 04:20.709
And...what is that smell?

04:20.834 --> 04:23.500
Been wondering

04:20.834 --> 04:23.500
the same thing.

04:23.625 --> 04:26.458
You'll never guess what

04:23.625 --> 04:26.458
that fertilizer was made of.

04:29.625 --> 04:32.291
Aah. Thanks.

04:32.417 --> 04:35.083
To win this competition,

04:32.417 --> 04:35.083
we need fresh ideas.

04:35.208 --> 04:37.250
Big ideas. Anybody?

04:37.375 --> 04:40.834
I know. We can put an end

04:37.375 --> 04:40.834
to high-flying rooftop rescues

04:40.959 --> 04:45.875
with--wait for it--retractable

04:40.959 --> 04:45.875
buildings. Thank you.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.542
Wouldn't that flatten

04:46.000 --> 04:48.542
all the people inside?

04:48.667 --> 04:49.792
Oh.

04:49.917 --> 04:52.375
Hm... How about a forest-wide

04:52.500 --> 04:54.875
sprinkler system

04:52.500 --> 04:54.875
for putting out brush fires?

04:55.000 --> 04:57.041
Nice. Or even better,

04:57.166 --> 05:00.917
a completely portable

04:57.166 --> 05:00.917
sprinkler system.

05:01.041 --> 05:03.333
A suit that sprays water

05:01.041 --> 05:03.333
in all directions

05:03.458 --> 05:06.208
so rescuers can safely

05:03.458 --> 05:06.208
walk into any blaze.

05:06.333 --> 05:08.250
Hm...

05:06.333 --> 05:08.250
Interesting.

05:08.375 --> 05:10.500
Saving trees is a good

05:08.375 --> 05:10.500
starting point.

05:10.625 --> 05:13.959
But...why not use trees

05:10.625 --> 05:13.959
to save cities?

05:14.083 --> 05:16.375
Uh, you lost me.

05:16.500 --> 05:20.792
See? Self-sustaining rainforest

05:16.500 --> 05:20.792
towers built in urban areas.

05:20.917 --> 05:23.917
They would clean the air of

05:20.917 --> 05:23.917
carbon dioxide, produce oxygen,

05:24.041 --> 05:27.041
and sustain

05:24.041 --> 05:27.041
an endangered ecosystem.

05:27.166 --> 05:28.583
Needs a sprinkler system.

05:28.709 --> 05:30.500
I fear it might

05:28.709 --> 05:30.500
disrupt traffic flow.

05:30.625 --> 05:32.208
But can it retract?

05:32.333 --> 05:34.041
It looks like

05:32.333 --> 05:34.041
the magic beanstalk

05:34.166 --> 05:35.750
in that story

05:34.166 --> 05:35.750
you told us, Cody.

05:35.875 --> 05:37.083
What about my idea?

05:37.208 --> 05:39.125
The sprinkler suit

05:37.208 --> 05:39.125
could save lives too.

05:39.250 --> 05:42.208
Mine might save the planet.

05:42.333 --> 05:44.291
(  western theme playing  )

05:48.041 --> 05:49.667
They're both good ideas.

05:49.792 --> 05:52.291
So why don't you each enter

05:49.792 --> 05:52.291
the contest separately?

05:52.417 --> 05:54.417
Well, I guess we could.

05:54.542 --> 05:56.667
May the best innovation win.

06:00.333 --> 06:04.917
The finalists in our New Youth

06:00.333 --> 06:04.917
Invention competition.

06:05.041 --> 06:06.750
Their brains may be small--

06:06.875 --> 06:08.834
Ugh! Dah! Duh!

06:08.959 --> 06:12.542
( chuckling )

06:08.959 --> 06:12.542
--but their ideas are big!

06:14.834 --> 06:18.250
And the winner of the best

06:14.834 --> 06:18.250
innovation is...

06:18.375 --> 06:22.166
Francine Greene's Sky Forest!

06:22.291 --> 06:24.250
( crowd clapping )

06:27.291 --> 06:31.458
That's my little wunderkind.

06:34.834 --> 06:36.709
You can forget about

06:34.834 --> 06:36.709
any donations

06:36.834 --> 06:39.542
to your reelection campaign,

06:36.834 --> 06:39.542
mayor.

06:39.667 --> 06:44.333
Wah-hah!

06:39.667 --> 06:44.333
Do... you... mind?

06:47.500 --> 06:48.667
Hey, Frankie, congrat--

06:48.792 --> 06:51.417
Francine Greene and Cody Burns.

06:51.542 --> 06:54.041
From best friends

06:51.542 --> 06:54.041
to bitter enemies.

06:54.166 --> 06:55.500
What?

06:55.625 --> 06:57.959
Cody, you've been delivered

06:55.625 --> 06:57.959
a crushing defeat

06:58.083 --> 07:01.083
by someone you once

06:58.083 --> 07:01.083
trusted like a sister.

07:01.208 --> 07:03.041
No, I--

07:03.166 --> 07:07.375
Mayor, what's next for

07:03.166 --> 07:07.375
Francine Greene's Sky Forest?

07:07.500 --> 07:09.709
Why, we're building

07:07.500 --> 07:09.709
a full-scale version

07:09.834 --> 07:11.458
right here in Griffin Rock.

07:11.875 --> 07:13.875
Tourists will flock to see it.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.875
And Little Miss Greene

07:14.000 --> 07:17.875
will be famous.

07:18.041 --> 07:20.625
Frankie and Cody are enemies?

07:18.041 --> 07:20.625
When did this happen?

07:20.750 --> 07:23.583
It's tough to lose,

07:20.750 --> 07:23.583
especially to a friend.

07:23.709 --> 07:26.500
If they're enemies,

07:23.709 --> 07:26.500
we'll have to choose sides.

07:26.625 --> 07:28.667
That's what happens

07:26.625 --> 07:28.667
in every buddy movie.

07:28.792 --> 07:32.250
I think it's called

07:28.792 --> 07:32.250
the Bro Code.

07:32.375 --> 07:35.166
I find no reference to this code

07:32.375 --> 07:35.166
in the civil statutes.

07:35.291 --> 07:38.000
But...I do value loyalty.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.834
Cody, we stand with you.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.834
Solidarity!

07:40.959 --> 07:43.000
Team Cody all the way.

07:43.125 --> 07:46.959
We'll teach her for being

07:43.125 --> 07:46.959
smarter than you!

07:47.083 --> 07:48.625
What?

07:48.750 --> 07:51.166
I just wish there could've been

07:48.750 --> 07:51.166
two first-place winners.

07:51.291 --> 07:56.583
Thanks, guys,

07:51.291 --> 07:56.583
but Frankie won fair and square.

07:56.709 --> 07:58.792
Then who are we

07:56.709 --> 07:58.792
supposed to be mad at?

08:00.667 --> 08:02.583
You've reached

08:00.667 --> 08:02.583
Frankie's vid-com.

08:02.709 --> 08:03.875
I can't take your call right now

08:04.000 --> 08:05.750
because I'm out

08:04.000 --> 08:05.750
doing interviews.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.792
Reviewing engineering reports.

08:08.917 --> 08:10.625
Going over blueprints.

08:11.875 --> 08:14.500
The Sky Forest is being

08:11.875 --> 08:14.500
assembled today!

08:16.000 --> 08:18.208
( sighs )

08:33.792 --> 08:35.709
Second level secure.

08:35.834 --> 08:37.458
GRAHAM:

08:35.834 --> 08:37.458
Let's bring in the third.

08:41.625 --> 08:42.875
( gasps )

08:49.917 --> 08:53.166
Dad, one of the cables

08:49.917 --> 08:53.166
is snapping!

08:53.291 --> 08:55.417
Everyone clear the area now!

08:55.542 --> 08:57.000
Move it, people!

08:55.542 --> 08:57.000
Go! Go!

08:57.125 --> 09:00.667
Move aside... Women

08:57.125 --> 09:00.667
and elected officials first!

09:00.792 --> 09:02.917
Rescue Bots, leap to the rescue.

09:03.041 --> 09:06.333
( grunting )

09:09.083 --> 09:11.625
( all gasping )

09:11.750 --> 09:14.417
ALL:

09:11.750 --> 09:14.417
Ah...whew.

09:16.875 --> 09:20.709
Wow. That's... uh...tall.

09:20.834 --> 09:23.000
Yep. Blends right in.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.583
Uh, what's everybody

09:26.333 --> 09:28.583
doing over there?

09:28.709 --> 09:30.041
Praising Frankie.

09:30.166 --> 09:33.333
Nice of her to hoist

09:30.166 --> 09:33.333
all that steel and concrete.

09:33.458 --> 09:35.125
Oh, wait, that was us.

09:35.250 --> 09:36.542
You guys were amazing.

09:36.667 --> 09:38.458
But Frankie deserves

09:36.667 --> 09:38.458
a lot of credit too.

09:38.583 --> 09:39.959
Does no one care

09:38.583 --> 09:39.959
that this structure

09:40.083 --> 09:43.375
clearly violates

09:40.083 --> 09:43.375
local height restrictions?

09:43.500 --> 09:46.667
Uh...hey, Frankie.

09:43.500 --> 09:46.667
Cool medal. Can I--?

09:46.792 --> 09:49.875
Hang on, Cody. Here comes

09:46.792 --> 09:49.875
the news we've been waiting for.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.291
The Sky Forest

09:50.000 --> 09:52.291
is structurally sound.

09:52.417 --> 09:54.917
And the irrigation system

09:52.417 --> 09:54.917
is fully functional.

09:55.041 --> 09:57.333
Positively splendid!

09:55.041 --> 09:57.333
Was there ever any doubt?

09:57.458 --> 10:00.000
That's a big relief.

09:57.458 --> 10:00.000
I can't believe it's real!

10:00.125 --> 10:02.000
You should be very proud,

10:00.125 --> 10:02.000
Frankie.

10:02.125 --> 10:06.166
I'd say that's a good day's

10:02.125 --> 10:06.166
work, my dear. Time to turn in.

10:06.291 --> 10:08.542
Daddy, with the seeds

10:06.291 --> 10:08.542
already planted,

10:08.667 --> 10:11.125
how long before

10:08.667 --> 10:11.125
we have a rainforest?

10:11.250 --> 10:13.709
Oh, I'd say 10 years or so.

10:13.834 --> 10:17.542
Ten years? What do we show

10:13.834 --> 10:17.542
the tourists in the meantime?

10:17.667 --> 10:20.792
Sorry, mayor.

10:17.667 --> 10:20.792
Mother Nature won't be rushed.

10:33.375 --> 10:34.625
Whoa!

10:41.083 --> 10:43.333
Apparently, someone rushed

10:41.083 --> 10:43.333
Mother Nature.

10:43.458 --> 10:45.750
I hope there's no giant

10:43.458 --> 10:45.750
at the top.

10:45.875 --> 10:47.834
Come one, come all

10:47.959 --> 10:52.625
to Griffin Rock's very own

10:47.959 --> 10:52.625
fully mature Sky Forest,

10:52.750 --> 10:55.417
the Eighth Wonder of the World.

10:55.542 --> 10:59.208
( all gasp )

10:55.542 --> 10:59.208
Amazing!

10:55.542 --> 10:59.208
That's incredible!

10:59.333 --> 11:02.000
Mayor, you're responsible

10:59.333 --> 11:02.000
for this?

11:02.125 --> 11:05.083
Ah, no kudos necessary, chief.

11:05.208 --> 11:07.667
Amazing what a little

11:05.208 --> 11:07.667
rapid growth formula

11:07.792 --> 11:10.750
in the irrigation

11:07.792 --> 11:10.750
system can do, huh? Ha, ha, ha.

11:10.875 --> 11:12.667
Where did you find

11:10.875 --> 11:12.667
that much formula?

11:12.792 --> 11:17.750
In the Hall of Inspiration.

11:12.792 --> 11:17.750
Turns out we had barrels of it.

11:20.083 --> 11:23.542
These barrels came from

11:20.083 --> 11:23.542
the Best Left Forgotten section!

11:23.667 --> 11:25.875
Didn't you read

11:23.667 --> 11:25.875
the warning labels?

11:26.000 --> 11:27.709
The labels said

11:26.000 --> 11:27.709
Aggressive Growth.

11:27.834 --> 11:29.709
Precisely what we needed.

11:29.834 --> 11:32.166
What we needed was

11:29.834 --> 11:32.166
time and patience.

11:32.291 --> 11:35.083
Plants aren't meant

11:32.291 --> 11:35.083
to grow that fast, mayor.

11:35.208 --> 11:39.500
Relax. This Sky Forest

11:35.208 --> 11:39.500
is perfectly safe.

11:39.625 --> 11:41.417
Go explore, have fun.

11:41.542 --> 11:44.125
And tomorrow we open

11:41.542 --> 11:44.125
to the public!

11:44.250 --> 11:49.709
It's not how I intended it to

11:44.250 --> 11:49.709
happen, but...it's kinda cool!

11:49.834 --> 11:54.625
Uh, Frankie. I... I never had

11:49.834 --> 11:54.625
the chance to congratulate you.

11:54.750 --> 12:00.458
( giggles )

11:54.750 --> 12:00.458
Thanks, Cody. Everything's

11:54.750 --> 12:00.458
been happening so fast.

12:00.583 --> 12:04.083
Um, you're not mad

12:00.583 --> 12:04.083
that I won, are you?

12:04.208 --> 12:05.834
You kiddin'?

12:05.959 --> 12:09.959
Even I know a leaky sprinkler

12:05.959 --> 12:09.959
suit can't stack up to this.

12:10.125 --> 12:11.917
( giggles )

12:10.125 --> 12:11.917
Race you to the top!

12:12.041 --> 12:15.500
( both laughing )

12:12.041 --> 12:15.500
Wait, no!

12:12.041 --> 12:15.500
I'm gonna beat you!

12:15.625 --> 12:17.291
It appears Cody

12:15.625 --> 12:17.291
is still distraught.

12:17.417 --> 12:19.041
He is now trying

12:17.417 --> 12:19.041
to tackle Frankie.

12:19.166 --> 12:21.208
I think they're

12:19.166 --> 12:21.208
just having fun.

12:21.333 --> 12:23.917
So the rivalry is over?

12:21.333 --> 12:23.917
What a relief.

12:24.041 --> 12:27.041
I missed being able

12:24.041 --> 12:27.041
to like Frankie.

12:27.166 --> 12:31.458
HEATWAVE:

12:27.166 --> 12:31.458
Something just doesn't

12:27.166 --> 12:31.458
feel right.

12:32.542 --> 12:34.875
( both giggling )

12:35.000 --> 12:36.834
BOTH:

12:35.000 --> 12:36.834
Whoa...

12:39.792 --> 12:41.792
( birds chirping )

12:42.834 --> 12:44.750
( both laughing )

12:44.875 --> 12:47.000
(  playful theme playing  )

12:50.000 --> 12:52.667
CODY:

12:50.000 --> 12:52.667
Noble!

12:52.792 --> 12:57.667
Ha, ha, ha.

12:52.792 --> 12:57.667
Ah, I could live here.

13:02.125 --> 13:04.125
(  magical theme playing  )

13:08.834 --> 13:10.834
(  pleasant theme playing  )

13:16.417 --> 13:17.959
( kids panting )

13:18.083 --> 13:20.709
Ugh! Awesome!

13:20.834 --> 13:23.208
Ugh! Ha, ha, ha! Aah!

13:25.709 --> 13:28.750
Frankie?

13:28.875 --> 13:30.166
Frankie!

13:32.834 --> 13:34.917
Frankie!

13:39.750 --> 13:41.333
Aah!

13:41.458 --> 13:43.083
( mumbling )

13:43.208 --> 13:45.625
( grunting )

13:43.208 --> 13:45.625
Hey, yah!

13:45.750 --> 13:48.000
Aah!

13:50.792 --> 13:51.959
Run!

13:52.083 --> 13:54.959
( panting )

13:55.083 --> 13:56.625
( gasps, grunts )

14:01.917 --> 14:05.166
How can vines

14:01.917 --> 14:05.166
even come after us?

14:05.291 --> 14:07.291
They cling to everything

14:05.291 --> 14:07.291
as they grow.

14:07.417 --> 14:09.834
These are just growing too fast!

14:09.959 --> 14:12.333
Dad! The rainforest

14:09.959 --> 14:12.333
is attacking!

14:12.458 --> 14:14.208
Frankie and I are trapped

14:12.458 --> 14:14.208
on the top level!

14:14.333 --> 14:16.834
Dani, get your chopper up there.

14:14.333 --> 14:16.834
On it.

14:16.959 --> 14:19.917
Kade and Graham, we need

14:16.959 --> 14:19.917
to evacuate the other levels.

14:20.041 --> 14:21.417
Smooth move, mayor!

14:23.959 --> 14:26.834
Rescue Bots, doors open!

14:26.959 --> 14:28.875
Don't worry, Doc.

14:26.959 --> 14:28.875
We'll take care of the kids.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.542
Just keep any newcomers

14:29.000 --> 14:31.542
out of the forest.

14:31.667 --> 14:36.083
That Aggressive Growth Warning

14:31.667 --> 14:36.083
mean anything to you now, mayor?

14:36.208 --> 14:39.750
No time for pointing fingers.

14:36.208 --> 14:39.750
Back, people!

14:48.125 --> 14:49.583
( bird clucking )

14:52.041 --> 14:55.500
Oh. Ha, ha, ha. Ohh!

15:00.166 --> 15:02.583
( boys yelping )

15:04.500 --> 15:07.125
I want all of them.

15:07.250 --> 15:08.375
Those too.

15:08.500 --> 15:09.875
( gasps )

15:08.500 --> 15:09.875
And--

15:12.834 --> 15:14.834
( hissing )

15:16.667 --> 15:18.208
( grunts, gasps )

15:29.000 --> 15:30.959
Cody, Frankie, hurry! Get in!

15:31.083 --> 15:33.792
BLADES:

15:31.083 --> 15:33.792
Before these vines make us

15:31.083 --> 15:33.792
part of the scenery!

15:33.917 --> 15:35.875
( all grunting )

15:39.959 --> 15:41.417
( grunts )

15:48.959 --> 15:51.792
Heads up, everybody. Keep moving

15:48.959 --> 15:51.792
or you'll never make it out.

16:03.458 --> 16:05.834
Mr. Harrison, fly away, quickly!

16:16.500 --> 16:19.250
Run, Boulder!

16:19.375 --> 16:21.625
( grunts, gasps )

16:21.750 --> 16:23.709
( grunting )

16:26.041 --> 16:30.125
I love trees...

16:26.041 --> 16:30.125
but not this much.

16:37.709 --> 16:39.458
The vines are spreading

16:37.709 --> 16:39.458
all over town.

16:39.583 --> 16:41.000
How do we stop them?

16:41.125 --> 16:43.375
By cutting off their supply

16:41.125 --> 16:43.375
of growth formula.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.083
That should stop them

16:43.500 --> 16:45.083
in their tracks.

16:45.208 --> 16:47.875
We just need to get to

16:45.208 --> 16:47.875
the shut-off valve on Level 5.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.583
I-I could try

16:48.000 --> 16:49.583
to fly us in there,

16:49.709 --> 16:51.417
but I don't think

16:49.709 --> 16:51.417
we'd get very far.

16:56.458 --> 16:58.917
Look! The plants are

16:56.458 --> 16:58.917
recoiling from the ocean.

16:59.041 --> 17:02.291
Salt water! I have an idea.

16:59.041 --> 17:02.291
Take us to the Firehouse.

17:05.750 --> 17:08.667
Heatwave, how about we

17:05.750 --> 17:08.667
break out the tools.

17:08.792 --> 17:10.959
You heard him.

17:08.792 --> 17:10.959
Let's move, team.

17:11.083 --> 17:14.917
BOTH:

17:11.083 --> 17:14.917
Power up and energize!

17:23.041 --> 17:24.291
Get 'em  inside.

17:27.625 --> 17:29.709
Into the truck!

17:29.834 --> 17:31.792
( Kade grunting )

17:44.125 --> 17:48.041
Aah! Aah! All right, don't

17:44.125 --> 17:48.041
worry, you're safe in here.

17:48.166 --> 17:50.625
Takes more than some overgrown

17:48.166 --> 17:50.625
spinach to stop a trained--

17:50.750 --> 17:52.333
Aah! Aah! Aah!

17:55.375 --> 18:00.083
( hissing )

18:05.542 --> 18:07.959
Ugh, it's about time!

18:08.083 --> 18:10.083
Priscilla, follow me

18:08.083 --> 18:10.083
to the stairs.

18:10.208 --> 18:12.166
( panting )

18:19.625 --> 18:23.333
This vegetation appears

18:19.625 --> 18:23.333
to have...entangled us, sir.

18:23.458 --> 18:25.834
Chase and I are trapped

18:23.458 --> 18:25.834
on Level 2. Status?

18:25.959 --> 18:27.917
KADE: Same here, Level 3.

18:25.959 --> 18:27.917
GRAHAM: Level 4!

18:28.041 --> 18:30.375
CODY:

18:28.041 --> 18:30.375
Don't panic, everybody.

18:28.041 --> 18:30.375
We have a plan.

18:32.250 --> 18:34.250
(  dramatic theme playing  )

18:39.375 --> 18:40.750
Thirsty?

18:40.875 --> 18:44.208
How about a refreshing

18:40.875 --> 18:44.208
taste of the ocean?

18:52.333 --> 18:55.500
It's working! These plants

18:52.333 --> 18:55.500
do not like salt water.

18:57.291 --> 19:01.750
Ah! Creepy! Creepy!

19:01.875 --> 19:03.875
Ooh!

19:10.000 --> 19:13.500
Aah!

19:10.000 --> 19:13.500
No, Cody, keep going!

19:13.625 --> 19:15.959
Cody, look for a big,

19:13.625 --> 19:15.959
red shut-off valve!

19:18.250 --> 19:20.041
Ugh! Get in!

19:22.083 --> 19:24.083
( both grunting )

19:25.834 --> 19:27.083
BLADES:

19:25.834 --> 19:27.083
Aah!

19:32.917 --> 19:35.709
Oh, no...my tank's empty.

19:45.625 --> 19:47.625
( grunts )

19:53.041 --> 19:56.667
Aah! Aah!

19:59.041 --> 20:00.625
Noble!

20:05.041 --> 20:07.542
BOTH: Yay!

20:05.041 --> 20:07.542
Woo-hoo!

20:07.667 --> 20:09.000
Oh, that was close.

20:09.125 --> 20:10.834
( grunts )

20:12.792 --> 20:13.959
( boys giggling )

20:12.792 --> 20:13.959
Yeah!

20:14.083 --> 20:16.750
Longest 20 minutes

20:14.083 --> 20:16.750
of my life.

20:20.375 --> 20:23.792
Yeah, next time, Dr. Greene,

20:20.375 --> 20:23.792
you might want to lock

20:23.917 --> 20:26.375
that Best Left Forgotten

20:23.917 --> 20:26.375
Section.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.750
( knock on window )

20:28.875 --> 20:31.375
Um, excuse me,

20:28.875 --> 20:31.375
my Hover-Picker was swallowed

20:31.500 --> 20:33.875
by your Venus Flytrap, mayor.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.834
Here's the cost of replacing it.

20:35.959 --> 20:38.333
Just send the check

20:35.959 --> 20:38.333
to my mother's accountant.

20:40.458 --> 20:42.125
Oh!

20:47.250 --> 20:52.375
And so Griffin Rock bids adieu

20:47.250 --> 20:52.375
to its urban tower of trees.

20:52.500 --> 20:55.875
The Sky Forest is being

20:52.500 --> 20:55.875
relocated to Wayward Island,

20:56.000 --> 20:59.250
the nearly inaccessible

20:56.000 --> 20:59.250
atoll off our coast.

20:59.375 --> 21:02.875
Sorry it didn't work out quite

20:59.375 --> 21:02.875
the way you planned, Frankie.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.125
Daddy always says,

21:03.000 --> 21:06.125
"Big ideas are like seeds.

21:06.250 --> 21:08.917
they need time to grow."

21:09.041 --> 21:12.291
At least now the Sky Forest

21:09.041 --> 21:12.291
will get that time.

21:12.417 --> 21:15.500
Here, I wanted to give you this.

21:15.625 --> 21:17.750
Uh, what happened to your medal?

21:17.875 --> 21:21.709
I had my father cut it in half

21:17.875 --> 21:21.709
so you and I could share it.

21:21.834 --> 21:24.500
My idea might've

21:21.834 --> 21:24.500
won the contest,

21:24.625 --> 21:28.875
but, like you said,

21:24.625 --> 21:28.875
yours saved lives.

21:31.959 --> 21:37.959
