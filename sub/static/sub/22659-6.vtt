01:28.480 --> 01:30.960
Go, go, go!

01:36.235 --> 01:38.480
Start the car, man.
Start this fuckin' car!

01:38.520 --> 01:42.200
- Are you deaf?
- I brought two suits.

01:42.280 --> 01:45.760
That was the deal. I'm not
driving through Marseille with

01:45.795 --> 01:49.200
someone in a red prison uniform.
They'll be looking for us.

01:49.280 --> 01:52.560
One of you will have to get out.
This car doesn't start until you do.

01:58.760 --> 02:02.400
You're heads. You're tails.

02:10.080 --> 02:13.200
Tails.
You lost. Out.

02:47.800 --> 02:50.760
I'm out 5 minutes and the
Corsicans are already after me.

02:50.960 --> 02:54.320
- Can't a man go to a funeral in peace?
- Move it!

03:08.080 --> 03:10.300
Come on, man!

03:14.120 --> 03:17.280
<i>- Dieter?
- How are those new tires I put there for you?</i>

03:17.320 --> 03:20.800
<i>- What do you want, Dieter?
- I need to show you something in the garage...</i>

03:20.840 --> 03:22.840
straight away. Hurry up.

03:22.920 --> 03:24.560
I have to stop by the house first.

03:24.595 --> 03:26.200
- I'll swing by later.
- And look after...

03:31.080 --> 03:32.560
...the car.

03:43.720 --> 03:45.480
- Move! Move!
- Sorry about that.

04:14.920 --> 04:16.880
Looks like the cops
are already after you as well.

04:16.959 --> 04:20.000
- Maybe we should keep going.
Miss the funeral. - No.

04:20.040 --> 04:22.320
- He'll drive us wherever we want.
- That's not the deal.

05:29.120 --> 05:33.120
- Mr. Gianni Labratta.
- Let me bury my brother.

05:47.240 --> 05:49.120
Thank you.

05:55.320 --> 05:58.720
Hello, Inspector Tarconi.
It's nice to see you.

05:58.760 --> 06:01.160
Hello, Frank,
it's always nice to see you.

06:01.240 --> 06:03.800
Even on such a sad occasion.

06:03.840 --> 06:07.040
You brought one of the mourners?

06:08.640 --> 06:12.000
- I would ask you who, but...
- Yes, it's, um...

06:12.040 --> 06:14.720
it's important to respect
the family's privacy.

06:14.760 --> 06:17.280
Yes, privacy, that...
that's right.

06:17.360 --> 06:22.240
Oh, by the way, I was at your place
last week. I hope you don't mind.

06:22.320 --> 06:25.400
Of course not. You're welcome
to stop by anytime, you know that.

06:25.440 --> 06:28.080
Thank you.

08:25.640 --> 08:27.680
May I?

08:27.720 --> 08:30.800
- Of course.
- Thanks.

08:30.880 --> 08:33.600
- I don't see many people down here.
- Neither do I.

08:33.679 --> 08:37.280
- You local?
- No, a friend told me about the beach.

08:37.315 --> 08:41.120
He didn't tell me
about the rocks. And you?

08:41.200 --> 08:44.360
I live in the house on the point.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.880
- Nice.
- I like it.

08:46.960 --> 08:50.560
- Quiet.
- Yeah.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.680
I should go.
I have work to do.

08:55.715 --> 08:57.480
Me too. I, um...

08:59.360 --> 09:02.080
- It was nice meeting you.
- I'm Juliette.

09:05.120 --> 09:13.760
- Frank.
- Good. Hope to see you again. Bye.

09:32.950 --> 09:38.070
- I see you scratched the hood.
- So you're in a bad mood?

09:38.150 --> 09:40.030
I'm tired, Dieter. What do you want?
What do you want to show me?

09:40.070 --> 09:42.670
Nothing. I lied.
To get you here.

09:42.750 --> 09:46.110
You was in a bad mood already...

09:46.150 --> 09:48.750
and it was for a good
cause, a very good cause...

09:48.830 --> 09:50.630
<i>He did it for me.</i>

09:50.710 --> 09:53.870
- Who are you?
- I can't tell you that.

09:53.950 --> 09:54.950
Why?

09:54.990 --> 09:58.750
- I thought you said no names?
- I'm sorry, Frank.

09:58.790 --> 10:01.350
- Trina is an old friend of mine.
- Now I know her name.

10:01.430 --> 10:03.950
I don't do referrals.
It doesn't work that way.

10:07.310 --> 10:10.190
It's not a referral.
I'm looking for a driver.

10:10.270 --> 10:12.230
Dieter says he knows
someone and you show up.

10:12.310 --> 10:16.070
- Are you a driver or not?
- I'm not interested.

10:16.150 --> 10:19.870
Frank. If our friendship means
anything to you, please, listen.

10:24.710 --> 10:28.070
- I'm listening.
- Okay. Trina's father, Laurent.

10:28.150 --> 10:30.950
He taught me everything.
Everything I know about cars.

10:30.990 --> 10:33.350
More names.

10:33.390 --> 10:36.950
Okay, what's the story?

10:37.030 --> 10:40.110
My father's been working
on a new system, the XR-50.

10:40.145 --> 10:44.470
It's a retrofitted unit that
reduces fuel consumption by 70%.

10:44.510 --> 10:47.230
But two weeks ago, our factory
and the prototypes

10:47.350 --> 10:49.870
- were destroyed in a fire.
- Who'd want to destroy that?

10:49.950 --> 10:52.710
Jurgen Smith, President
of Casso Petrochemicals.

10:52.790 --> 10:54.750
My father used to work for them.

10:54.830 --> 10:57.310
But this new system would mean
a vast reduction in fuel consumption.

10:57.350 --> 10:59.870
And let me guess.
There's only one prototype left.

10:59.910 --> 11:04.510
And people have died for this.
Two men in the fire,

11:04.590 --> 11:06.430
and Marc Cousteau,
my father's chief engineer.

11:06.470 --> 11:08.910
Marc was a great man.
A genius.

11:08.990 --> 11:11.150
He's responsible for
the final working design.

11:11.230 --> 11:15.470
Without him or the prototype,
the XR-50's finished.

11:17.550 --> 11:19.390
- What's the deal?
- I have to get it

11:19.430 --> 11:22.870
to the Paris Motor
Show by tomorrow, 9 AM.

11:32.070 --> 11:36.750
Okay.
Okay, I'll do it.

11:39.950 --> 11:42.910
If you kiss me, the deal's off.

11:42.950 --> 11:46.790
- No, no, no, I just want to say thank you.
- I swear to God,

11:46.870 --> 11:50.190
- kiss me, the deal's off.
- I'm happy. Thanks. That's great.

12:01.470 --> 12:04.510
- Laurent is here?
- He's here, yeah.

12:15.390 --> 12:19.590
- Yes, Trina. Sá va?
- The Transporter said yes.

12:19.670 --> 12:22.270
Yes! He'll
beta-test it the whole way?

12:22.310 --> 12:24.430
I haven't exactly
told him it's a test.

12:24.510 --> 12:26.710
<i>None of our simulations can
come close to what he'll do,</i>

12:26.750 --> 12:30.430
and we need to demonstrate the XR-50's
optimum ability once it's in Paris.

12:30.510 --> 12:33.470
<i>- Make sure he really puts it through its paces.
- I have a feeling</i>

12:33.510 --> 12:37.030
that won't be hard for this driver.
I have to go, Papa. Je t'aime.

12:37.110 --> 12:40.470
Okay, I'll see you in Paris. Bye.

12:40.510 --> 12:42.710
Guess who's talking to her daddy...

12:42.750 --> 12:46.030
<i>- You know where Trina is?
- Uh-huh. She's in Nice.</i>

12:46.110 --> 12:48.990
Don't do anything till we
know she has the prototype.

12:49.070 --> 12:54.070
I know my job, Jurgen.
Don't worry, I won't hurt the girl

12:54.150 --> 12:56.350
<i>- unless I have to.
- Enough people have died, Le Loup.</i>

12:56.430 --> 12:58.870
You want to make an omelette,
you have to break a few eggs.

13:10.230 --> 13:12.950
The XR-50 is a miracle of economy,
precision and simplicity.

13:13.030 --> 13:16.790
And to think that it's not even German.
That's incredible. It can be fitted to any car.

13:18.390 --> 13:20.950
Wire the control unit into the
on board computer, et voila,

13:20.990 --> 13:23.470
you have clean, mean motoring.

13:23.510 --> 13:28.350
- Is this thing going to affect performance?
- Yes. For the better.

13:28.430 --> 13:31.430
You're telling me this thing uses
less fuel and will make the car faster?

13:31.510 --> 13:33.790
Yes, it's genius!
I told you. It's total genius!

13:33.870 --> 13:37.390
Well, yes, eventually.
The unit has a memory system...

13:37.430 --> 13:39.830
it learns to operate at
the level it's driven at,

13:39.870 --> 13:42.790
and then maximizes fuel
efficiency and increases power.

13:43.350 --> 13:47.710
- So I'm the guinea pig.
- Kind of.

13:50.310 --> 13:52.830
It's alive...

13:55.110 --> 13:57.950
I am now looking at
a flashing blue light.

13:58.030 --> 14:00.910
The XR-50 is alive and well.

14:00.950 --> 14:06.350
So Trina has the last prototype.
I want it.

14:06.390 --> 14:08.950
<i> Á la chasse!</i>

14:09.030 --> 14:14.550
Laurent! Laurent.
I was so sorry to hear about the fire.

14:14.630 --> 14:18.270
All our work gone. Did you get the
donation I sent for the families

14:18.350 --> 14:20.350
- of those poor men?
- You know it was murder, Jurgen.

14:20.430 --> 14:24.630
It pains me you think I
was involved. Our differences

14:24.670 --> 14:27.950
- could have been resolved.
- As long as I handed over the XR-50.

14:27.990 --> 14:30.790
- We did pay for it.
- I'm supposed to give it to you so you can bury it?

14:42.230 --> 14:45.870
- That's not good.
- What is it?

14:47.790 --> 14:49.990
Is there something
you haven't told me?

14:50.070 --> 14:53.390
Like, for example, someone knows
we're taking the XR-50 to Paris?

15:11.670 --> 15:14.030
I love it when they don't give up.

15:26.310 --> 15:28.790
Let's hope this thing works
as well as you say it does.

15:33.230 --> 15:34.510
Shit!

15:47.750 --> 15:53.070
- Now that's what I call a road test.
- They were trying to kill us!

15:53.110 --> 15:55.310
Your old man did a hell of a job.
This thing really works.

16:09.790 --> 16:12.470
<i>Fuckin' asshole!</i>

16:18.350 --> 16:21.950
<i>- Frank. Everything alright?
- In a word, no.</i>

16:22.030 --> 16:24.670
I need you to track me for a while.

16:24.750 --> 16:27.790
<i>Things on this Nice to Paris run
are about to get more complicated.</i>

16:27.830 --> 16:29.870
See what happens if you
take work I haven't vetted?

16:29.950 --> 16:32.670
Yes, Carla,
but right now I just need

16:32.750 --> 16:34.870
- the fastest route to Paris.
- You're throwing out

16:34.950 --> 16:37.750
a GSM 1800 signal. Red hot.

16:39.630 --> 16:42.550
Give me your cell phone.

16:52.710 --> 16:55.390
Sorry, had to be done.

16:55.470 --> 16:58.870
- You could have asked.
- And what would you have said?

16:58.950 --> 17:01.750
I would have taken the battery out.

17:05.030 --> 17:06.390
<i>There's a driver.</i>

17:06.425 --> 17:09.190
He's good. I wasn't expecting that.

17:09.230 --> 17:11.829
- Le Loup...
- As long as the prototype is switched on,

17:11.910 --> 17:13.950
<i>we can trace them.  If they try to hide</i>

17:13.990 --> 17:15.990
<i>by turning it off, they're standing still.</i>

17:16.069 --> 17:20.190
That car cannot make it to Paris.
Do whatever it takes.

17:20.230 --> 17:24.109
It's nearly 1,000 kilometres
between Nice and Paris.

17:24.190 --> 17:25.390
He hasn't got a chance.

17:25.425 --> 17:27.790
Now get off the fucking
phone, let me do my job.

17:39.150 --> 17:43.750
- I thought I smelled something.
- I know Trina is bringing the prototype.

17:43.830 --> 17:47.430
- That's ridiculous!
- The prototype won't make it.

17:47.510 --> 17:51.510
So call her.
Tell her to park the car and walk away.

17:51.590 --> 17:56.630
Ignore me
and her blood will be on your hands.

18:16.310 --> 18:19.830
<i>Hi, this is Trina.
Leave a message.</i>

18:19.865 --> 18:24.950
Trina, this is Papa.
Call me as soon as you can.

18:30.430 --> 18:33.310
- Why is it so hot in here?
- You know,

18:33.350 --> 18:35.790
there's more to life than
just driving your car, Frank.

18:35.870 --> 18:39.630
Maybe. But right now my only
concern is driving this car.

18:41.510 --> 18:43.430
Just a job,
is that "Mr. Professional"?

18:43.470 --> 18:47.590
It's nothing personal.
But yeah.

18:47.670 --> 18:50.550
You just drive things
from point A to point B?

18:50.630 --> 18:52.430
- Don't care what they are?
- That's what the rules are for.

18:52.510 --> 18:55.870
Rule number 1: Never change the deal.
Rule 2: No names.

18:55.910 --> 18:58.790
Rule 3: Don't open the package.

18:58.870 --> 19:01.310
Well, two of those are
already broken, Frank.

19:01.350 --> 19:04.470
Yeah, and I'm not happy about it.

19:21.830 --> 19:24.790
Would you mind?
Give it a pull.

19:37.190 --> 19:41.470
You think your machine could be
screwing with the car's electronics?

19:41.505 --> 19:43.550
Yes, there might be
a temporary adjustment process.

19:43.630 --> 19:48.830
- Adjustment process?
- I liked you better when you didn't speak.

19:56.990 --> 19:59.870
Of all the roads in all the world...

19:59.910 --> 20:02.470
Hold on!

20:21.230 --> 20:25.430
- This is more like it.
- Still hate the heat?

20:25.470 --> 20:28.470
I can take the heat if
the car performs like this.

20:36.310 --> 20:39.830
Why are we stopping?
Are you crazy? Drive!

20:42.230 --> 20:44.470
That box connects to
all the systems, right?

20:44.510 --> 20:47.670
Yes, it... that's what
makes it so efficient,

20:47.710 --> 20:50.430
it's a full override. It diverts
power to the systems that need it.

20:50.470 --> 20:52.350
Yeah, well, it's also
how they're tracking us.

20:52.430 --> 20:55.070
Just like a cell phone.
While it's off, we're invisible.

20:55.110 --> 20:57.510
The minute we turn it on, we might
as well paint a target on the roof.

20:57.590 --> 21:00.630
- It stays shut down.
- No.

21:00.665 --> 21:02.270
- Yes.
- No.

21:02.310 --> 21:05.270
The XR-50 needs
at least 750 kilometres

21:05.310 --> 21:08.390
to fully register performance
details. Your performance details.

21:08.470 --> 21:13.630
Hmm. What I really need
is a cold beer and a shower.

21:19.150 --> 21:22.550
What are you doing!?

21:22.630 --> 21:24.830
<i>Oh no.
No, no, no, no, no!</i>

21:24.910 --> 21:26.990
<i>Frank, Frank!</i>

21:27.070 --> 21:29.030
<i>There's no power to the brakes.</i>

21:29.110 --> 21:32.510
<i>Eh, who needs brakes?</i>

21:32.590 --> 21:35.150
<i>- Asshole!
- I'm an asshole?</i>

21:35.190 --> 21:37.630
<i>Yes, you're an asshole.</i>

21:38.910 --> 21:41.710
<i>- Someone's going to get killed.
- As long as it's not me.</i>

21:43.990 --> 21:46.950
<i>- Attention!
- Asshole!</i>

21:47.030 --> 21:49.630
<i>Asshole!</i>

22:14.030 --> 22:18.870
- The signal's dead.
- Search every car park, garage,

22:19.070 --> 22:25.670
hotel and junkyard in this town.
He's here, somewhere.

22:44.270 --> 22:49.110
- Admit it. You're impressed.
- No, I am not impressed.

23:02.710 --> 23:06.230
- What's the plan?
- We hole up.

23:06.270 --> 23:08.070
We'll have a better
chance tomorrow morning.

23:08.150 --> 23:10.510
It's only 100 kilometres to Paris.

23:18.710 --> 23:21.830
<i>- Hey Frank, how are you?
- I've had better days, Dieter.</i>

23:21.910 --> 23:24.910
I can't lie.
The car's a little bruised

23:24.990 --> 23:27.670
and I'm living my own version
of Smokey and the Bandit.

23:27.750 --> 23:29.230
Oh? Is Trina safe?

23:29.270 --> 23:32.990
She's fine.
As am I, thanks for asking.

23:33.070 --> 23:37.830
- Where are you?
- In a couple of hours I'll be in Paris.

23:37.910 --> 23:40.750
It's better that I didn't fly.

23:40.790 --> 23:43.390
<i>It's been a long time
since I did that drive</i>

23:43.470 --> 23:46.510
<i>- and I like it.
- Merci, monsieur.</i>

23:46.790 --> 23:48.750
Well, if you drove a real
car you'd be there by now.

23:48.790 --> 23:51.590
Keep the jokes coming, Frank,
and you can get the train home.

23:51.630 --> 23:53.470
I didn't ask you to come.

23:53.550 --> 23:56.030
I can't miss Laurent's
moment of triumph!

23:56.110 --> 23:57.910
<i>If I don't get Jurgen's
thugs off my back,</i>

23:57.990 --> 24:00.110
<i>there might not be
a moment of triumph.</i>

24:00.190 --> 24:02.470
The minute I turn the car on,
they know exactly where we are.

24:02.510 --> 24:04.030
Oh.

24:04.110 --> 24:07.430
That was me asking
what I can do, Dieter.

24:07.470 --> 24:09.870
That was me thinking.

24:09.950 --> 24:11.950
<i> Thinking and driving
can be dangerous.</i>

24:11.990 --> 24:14.550
I'll call you in a bit.
Don't drive too fast.

24:17.150 --> 24:21.070
- Who was that?
- Let me guess.

24:21.110 --> 24:23.790
- None of my business.
- I ordered some wine.

24:29.150 --> 24:32.590
I'm going to take a bath.

24:46.190 --> 24:49.670
- Hello?
- Papa, it's me.

24:49.710 --> 24:52.550
Trina! Where have you been?
I've been calling you!

24:52.590 --> 24:56.030
<i>- Jurgen knows you're coming.
- I'm okay. The Transporter lost them.</i>

24:56.110 --> 24:58.750
<i>- I... I'm safe now.
- Nothing's worth this, Trina.</i>

24:58.830 --> 25:01.270
<i>Leave the XR-50 and get out of there.</i>

25:01.350 --> 25:03.830
<i> No! Papa, I have to see this through.</i>

25:03.910 --> 25:05.750
<i>We have to face them down.</i>

25:05.830 --> 25:10.230
Jurgen, Casso, Big Oil.
I'm going through with it.

25:10.310 --> 25:12.590
No, I could not bear anything
to happen to you, Trina.

25:12.670 --> 25:14.430
<i>It won't.</i>

25:14.510 --> 25:17.750
Papa, you should see
the car. It's incredible.

25:17.830 --> 25:21.670
With this modification, and the
driver... it's responding better

25:21.750 --> 25:22.870
<i>than we ever imagined.</i>

25:22.905 --> 25:24.510
<i>- Really?
- It's actually faster.</i>

25:24.590 --> 25:27.950
And the fuel gauge barely
moved! Even the Transporter

25:28.030 --> 25:29.790
<i>is impressed, Papa.</i>

25:30.350 --> 25:32.550
I'll see you in Paris in the morning.

25:32.590 --> 25:35.230
<i>- Take care, chérie.
- You too.</i>

25:35.310 --> 25:38.790
And don't worry, I'm fine.
Je t'aime.

25:38.830 --> 25:42.550
Bye.

25:47.070 --> 25:48.950
<i>You don't like my idea?</i>

25:49.030 --> 25:53.390
- It's not really an idea, it's...
- Simple. I like simple.

25:53.470 --> 25:56.030
<i>See you soon. Don't get lost.</i>

25:57.910 --> 26:00.310
Not funny, Frank.

26:00.670 --> 26:05.670
- I am sorry, were you...
- It's fine.

26:10.470 --> 26:15.630
- You only booked one room?
- I'll sleep in the car.

26:15.710 --> 26:18.470
You afraid someone might
make off with her in the night?

26:18.510 --> 26:21.030
Something like that.

26:23.190 --> 26:26.550
You saved my life today.
And my father's work.

26:26.630 --> 26:32.990
I said I'd deliver the package.
That's what I'm gonna do.

26:33.030 --> 26:35.990
They're going to come after us
even harder tomorrow, aren't they?

26:37.030 --> 26:41.630
- Yes.
- And do you think we have a chance?

26:41.670 --> 26:45.190
There's always a chance.

26:45.270 --> 26:48.870
- You don't want to walk away?
- That would be changing the deal.

26:48.910 --> 26:53.070
And you wouldn't want
to do that, would you?

27:06.310 --> 27:10.790
- You've had a long day.
- Yes.

27:10.870 --> 27:14.510
And tomorrow will be
a long day also.

27:58.150 --> 28:00.870
<i>That's it.</i>

28:15.030 --> 28:17.070
- Where were you? I woke up,
you were gone and... - Get down.

28:17.150 --> 28:19.710
- What?
- Get down!

29:14.470 --> 29:17.190
<i>Ahh!!!</i>

29:28.750 --> 29:31.630
- Are you okay?
- Time to go.

29:40.870 --> 29:43.990
<i>You've got nowhere to go.</i>

29:44.030 --> 29:48.470
Get in the car and lock the doors.

29:53.990 --> 29:56.670
- I thought you'd be bigger.
- I thought you'd be better looking.

29:56.750 --> 30:00.710
There's no need for violence.
I know what you're after.

30:04.470 --> 30:07.990
You're very cool, my friend.

30:08.030 --> 30:09.910
Maybe too cool?

30:09.950 --> 30:12.350
<i>Hmm?
Maybe the car's rigged?</i>

30:12.710 --> 30:15.590
You open the hood.

30:18.190 --> 30:20.070
Get the unit.

30:22.910 --> 30:25.950
Get it, you idiot.

31:14.110 --> 31:16.070
- They're back.
- Oh shit.

31:17.910 --> 31:20.790
<i>We have visual contact.</i>

31:20.870 --> 31:23.430
Don't worry about tracking the unit.

31:25.790 --> 31:27.630
We're not going to
outrun them, are we?

31:27.670 --> 31:32.390
Nope.
But we do have options.

31:53.470 --> 31:55.270
Come on, you idiot!
Let's go!

32:00.470 --> 32:03.150
Ah, we got 'em!

32:17.830 --> 32:18.830
What the fuck?

32:51.150 --> 32:53.630
Up the side!
Go, go, go, go!

32:54.990 --> 32:56.750
Get close!

32:56.790 --> 32:59.470
Closer!

34:23.110 --> 34:24.830
<i> Oh, merde.</i>

35:08.510 --> 35:11.470
Trina!
Trina, open the door.

35:37.350 --> 35:40.950
- I'm stuck.
- Trina!

35:43.830 --> 35:47.430
If anyone ever asks
you what tipped you off,

35:47.470 --> 35:49.550
you can say it was me.

35:53.550 --> 35:57.870
- What's happening?
- We have a decision to make.

36:04.110 --> 36:06.310
Can you catch?

36:11.070 --> 36:13.390
Give it to the girl.

36:15.710 --> 36:19.430
- Give it to the girl!
- Trina, give me your hand.

36:25.630 --> 36:27.310
Hello?

36:27.390 --> 36:31.070
<i>- Trina, I'm here with your father.
- If you hurt him...</i>

36:31.150 --> 36:33.310
No, I don't hurt people.
That's what I pay Le Loup for.

36:33.350 --> 36:38.350
I just wanted your father to know
I wasn't lying about the situation.

36:41.310 --> 36:44.870
- Papa!?
- Trina?

36:44.910 --> 36:47.350
<i>The XR-50's finished.
I can't get it there.</i>

36:47.430 --> 36:50.590
<i>Just keep yourself safe.</i>

36:50.630 --> 36:52.670
<i>- I love you, Papa.
- Trina?</i>

36:53.670 --> 36:55.750
You bastard.

36:59.150 --> 37:02.230
Your father loves you, Trina.
And who could blame him?

37:02.310 --> 37:06.310
- Go to hell.
- Trina says goodbye.

37:17.070 --> 37:21.830
I hate negotiating.
It takes all the fun out of the job,

37:21.910 --> 37:23.990
- don't you think?
- That's easy for you to say.

37:25.670 --> 37:29.110
Shit.

37:29.190 --> 37:31.790
Ha. Need a push?

37:36.230 --> 37:41.390
I have to kill you now, you know that.
Nothing personal.

37:47.910 --> 37:51.670
<i>Dieter!
Forget the car!</i>

37:51.750 --> 37:54.470
Trina, back inside.

37:54.550 --> 37:58.670
<i>Open the sunroof.
Open the sunroof! Come on!</i>

38:07.590 --> 38:09.190
It's okay, come on.

38:10.470 --> 38:12.870
Okay, ready?
Give me your hand.

38:26.510 --> 38:28.550
Okay, round you go.

38:52.790 --> 38:55.270
The prototype. It's gone.

39:02.630 --> 39:06.030
We lost it. We'll never
get the XR-50 to the show.

39:06.110 --> 39:08.830
You're really
starting to piss me off.

39:11.110 --> 39:12.830
<i>Frank!</i>

39:13.950 --> 39:16.510
<i>Come on, Frank.</i>

39:22.830 --> 39:25.950
<i>Frank, careful!</i>

39:25.990 --> 39:28.550
<i>Now, Frank. Come on.</i>

39:32.990 --> 39:35.030
<i>Yeah, that's good.</i>

39:44.710 --> 39:47.270
<i>Good, Frank. Very good.</i>

39:48.550 --> 39:50.470
The shovel, Frank!

39:51.870 --> 39:54.390
<i>Hit him.
Hit him in the face, Frank.</i>

39:56.430 --> 39:58.350
<i>This is good. This is good.</i>

40:19.110 --> 40:21.310
<i>Yah. This is good, Frank.</i>

40:37.630 --> 40:41.790
- You took your time.
- Well, I didn't want to hit you.

40:41.870 --> 40:43.990
You said keep going no matter what.

40:44.070 --> 40:48.750
I was talking to her. And you did
the opposite of what I told you.

40:48.790 --> 40:53.710
Fine.
Let's go. Schnell.

40:56.710 --> 41:00.110
I don't see why I can't drive.
Maybe not so fast?

41:00.145 --> 41:02.750
My little girl Suzette isn't
used to going this fast.

41:02.830 --> 41:04.430
- Suzette?
- Yeah.

41:04.465 --> 41:07.750
Really?
You have to trust me, Dieter.

41:07.830 --> 41:10.070
Well, you could have told me that you took
the unit out of your car and gave it to Dieter.

41:10.110 --> 41:15.070
- I didn't want to ruin the surprise.
- That was a very good idea, Frank.

41:15.150 --> 41:17.350
They thought you had the
unit, so they followed you.

41:17.430 --> 41:19.950
Like a Trojan Horse.
That was my idea, Trina.

41:21.310 --> 41:24.910
- What?
- I know, Dieter.

41:24.950 --> 41:27.190
- I know.
- Yeah.

41:40.190 --> 41:41.710
No! Please... Frank!

41:41.750 --> 41:45.750
No, no, no. Suzette!

41:45.790 --> 41:48.830
Okay. Okay. Stop!

41:53.470 --> 41:57.350
Please, please, stop!

41:58.870 --> 42:01.550
Frank, not so fast.

42:01.590 --> 42:05.110
Frank, please.
Stop it!

42:07.390 --> 42:09.670
You're crazy, Frank!

42:11.030 --> 42:12.310
Frank!

42:14.270 --> 42:19.110
- There.
- Thank's god. You crazy driver.

42:20.510 --> 42:23.470
Where's my Papa?

42:26.070 --> 42:28.630
- Oh, Papa!
- Trina!

42:28.710 --> 42:32.150
- Go get the part.
- Oh, yeah.

42:32.230 --> 42:34.190
Thank you for keeping her safe.

42:50.110 --> 42:52.270
<i>And in a surprise change</i>

42:52.310 --> 42:55.190
<i>in our schedule, the highly
anticipated announcement</i>

42:55.270 --> 42:57.550
<i>from Laurent La Croix,
of La Croix Labs.</i>

42:57.590 --> 43:02.630
<i>Mr. La Croix has been working with
low fuel technology for several years</i>

43:02.670 --> 43:06.270
<i>and his brilliant success is
ready to be seen by the world.</i>

43:06.350 --> 43:09.190
<i>- Mr. La Croix!
- Thank you very much.</i>

43:09.230 --> 43:12.910
<i>This is what you've been
waiting for. This will change</i>

43:12.990 --> 43:16.550
<i>the way we think about fuel
efficiency and car design.</i>

43:16.590 --> 43:19.070
You must be Jurgen.

43:21.150 --> 43:23.150
Trina, this is Jurgen!

43:23.185 --> 43:26.190
Nice to put a face to the voice.

43:26.990 --> 43:29.670
Nicer to put a foot to the face.

43:36.830 --> 43:40.110
- We did it.
- You did it. Well done.

43:42.670 --> 43:45.470
Go and be with him.

44:03.190 --> 44:08.190
- Did you...?
- Open the package?

44:10.310 --> 44:14.110
There are rules, Dieter.

44:17.310 --> 44:19.590
We need to find a car.

44:29.670 --> 44:32.110
Oh no, Frank...
