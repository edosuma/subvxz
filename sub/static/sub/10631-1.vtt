01:56.246 --> 01:59.051
Hello. I'm Marv.

02:00.186 --> 02:02.959
Today we're gonna
discuss baths.

02:02.992 --> 02:05.965
More specifically,
how to take one.

02:05.998 --> 02:07.836
Baths have been around
for a long time.

02:09.238 --> 02:11.910
The ancient Romans
built fancy ones,

02:11.944 --> 02:13.346
like Caracalla.

02:13.380 --> 02:17.321
In the Middle Ages
they were called stews,

02:17.354 --> 02:20.294
because you had to be stewed
in order to take one.

02:20.327 --> 02:24.202
They were open
to both sexes.

02:25.537 --> 02:29.879
Today the Japanese
have bisexual bathing.

02:29.912 --> 02:33.587
Here in America we didn't
bathe so much until recently.

02:33.621 --> 02:37.429
The Saturday night bath
used to be a ritual.

02:37.461 --> 02:40.100
Today it's more like
every other day

02:40.134 --> 02:43.441
or... even every day.

02:44.575 --> 02:46.981
How do I know this?

02:47.014 --> 02:49.887
People have told me.
That's how.

02:50.622 --> 02:53.194
Start drawing your bath

02:53.226 --> 02:55.464
until it gets to
the temperature you want.

02:55.497 --> 02:58.570
Meanwhile,
remove clothing.

02:58.604 --> 03:02.179
Carefully insert your big toe
in the waters.

03:02.211 --> 03:05.584
This will tell you
if it's too hot or too cold.

03:05.618 --> 03:09.326
Hopefully
it'll be just right.

03:09.359 --> 03:12.031
Once in the tub,
start soaping.

03:12.065 --> 03:14.203
Start with the armpits

03:14.235 --> 03:16.373
and work down
to the genital area.

03:16.406 --> 03:20.449
Work carefully
in ever-widening circles.

04:26.615 --> 04:31.258
<i>Breathing, breathing.</i>

04:51.499 --> 04:53.303
In short, gentlemen,

04:54.504 --> 04:57.577
because of
the destabilization

04:57.610 --> 05:00.851
the blasting jelly
has become depressurized...

05:00.883 --> 05:02.887
All 500 pounds of it.

05:02.922 --> 05:04.492
The only thing

05:06.728 --> 05:10.369
that keeps it from going off
and destroying us all

05:12.541 --> 05:16.750
is the 50 fathoms of ocean
pressure above our heads.

05:18.820 --> 05:21.158
If we were to rise
any higher,

05:23.461 --> 05:26.368
we'd be blown to Nep...

05:26.401 --> 05:28.305
We haven't surfaced
in months.

05:28.339 --> 05:30.745
We need food.

05:30.777 --> 05:32.881
-We need oxygen.
-We should tell the captain.

05:32.915 --> 05:34.753
No. No!

05:34.785 --> 05:37.625
He hates

05:37.658 --> 05:40.665
to be bothered.

05:40.698 --> 05:42.368
But this is important!

05:42.401 --> 05:44.372
Let's make a break
for it!

05:44.404 --> 05:46.642
Let's head for the surface
and hope for the best!

05:46.675 --> 05:47.911
Are you mad?

05:47.945 --> 05:52.921
We'd be blown
to Neptune's daughters!

05:52.955 --> 05:55.328
We are doomed anyway!

05:55.360 --> 05:57.364
Is it really so mad?

06:03.644 --> 06:06.450
Two days. Forty-eight
hours of oxygen.

06:18.473 --> 06:20.378
<i>Breathing.</i>

06:22.547 --> 06:24.853
<i>Breathing, breathing.</i>

06:39.081 --> 06:41.654
Why always flapjacks?

06:43.023 --> 06:44.693
I told you,

06:44.727 --> 06:48.435
there are air pockets
in the batter

06:48.468 --> 06:50.505
of these flapjacks.

06:50.538 --> 06:53.478
Our oxygen will last
almost twice as long

06:53.510 --> 06:54.980
with these babies.

07:13.484 --> 07:15.924
No. Leave it.
Leave it! Leave it!

07:25.174 --> 07:26.543
He's wet!

07:36.029 --> 07:38.902
Why...
this is freshwater!

07:38.935 --> 07:41.575
If he got in,

07:41.607 --> 07:43.711
maybe we
can get out.

07:43.744 --> 07:47.218
How did you... Wh...
How did you get here?

07:47.251 --> 07:49.490
I can't remember.

07:49.523 --> 07:51.862
I was in a forest.

07:51.895 --> 07:54.735
I saw... a woman.

08:04.820 --> 08:07.227
-Who is this man?
-Why, that's our captain.

08:09.296 --> 08:11.734
I know him.

08:11.767 --> 08:13.938
Twelve hours.

08:13.971 --> 08:16.845
In just 12 little hours...

08:23.858 --> 08:27.232
<i>Breathing, breathing,</i>

08:27.266 --> 08:30.072
<i>breathing,</i>

08:30.105 --> 08:33.712
<i>breathing,
breathing,</i>

08:33.746 --> 08:36.217
<i>breathing.</i>

08:48.909 --> 08:52.316
Wait! Maybe we shouldn't
bother the captain after all.

08:52.349 --> 08:54.988
We're the jelly boys.

08:55.021 --> 08:57.927
Our place is here in the back,
protecting the jelly.

08:57.960 --> 08:59.932
What the stuff is
I couldn't tell you,

08:59.964 --> 09:02.804
but it's our job
to take care of it.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.018
Should he be here?

09:11.989 --> 09:13.894
Should be in the forest.

09:20.706 --> 09:23.412
Four men in the forest,

09:23.446 --> 09:28.256
as the old bard wrote in one
of his lesser-known plays,

09:28.289 --> 09:31.062
trying to rescue
a kidnapped woman.

09:34.001 --> 09:35.872
They can't agree on anything.

09:35.904 --> 09:38.008
Or so the story goes.

09:38.041 --> 09:40.981
Now see here, boys.

09:42.317 --> 09:44.387
I know we've been rivals
for Margot in the past.

09:44.421 --> 09:46.058
This is an emergency.

09:46.091 --> 09:48.195
We must put aside
all the dirty tricks

09:48.228 --> 09:50.433
we've been happy to play to
each other and work together.

09:50.466 --> 09:52.906
Yes,
but the Red Wolves...

09:52.939 --> 09:56.245
The most feared forest bandits
in all of Holstein-Schleswig.

09:56.278 --> 09:59.017
Yes, I know, but we can't let
that stop us. They have Margot.

09:59.051 --> 10:01.022
And who knows
what they're doing to her.

10:01.054 --> 10:04.260
We are aspiring lumberjacks.
Strong men.

10:04.293 --> 10:07.233
Saplingjacks
are four fine here standing.

10:07.266 --> 10:09.405
We know a hundred more
woodmen in these parts.

10:09.438 --> 10:11.944
We all have our axes
and our brawn.

10:11.977 --> 10:15.518
We just have to
get together and attack.

10:15.550 --> 10:19.090
We can get her back and put an end
to these Wolves once and for all!

10:19.125 --> 10:21.262
I can make a list of all
the lumberjacks we could ask.

10:21.263 --> 10:22.331
We have no time for lists!

10:22.364 --> 10:25.681
I can go to the various camps
and see if anyone's interested,

10:25.682 --> 10:27.341
see how many people we can get.

10:27.374 --> 10:30.547
Make sure you tell them that it's Margot
that's missing. She's so beautiful.

10:30.580 --> 10:32.818
There's bound to be
more volunteers

10:32.851 --> 10:35.023
if they know they're going
into the forest for Margot.

10:35.056 --> 10:37.494
No. No questions.
No surveys.

10:37.528 --> 10:41.270
<i>We go now. We crush the Red
Wolves and we get Margot.</i>

10:41.302 --> 10:45.912
I can't go. I can't come.
I-I-I'm...

10:45.945 --> 10:48.350
<i>I would... I want to,
but I-I-I-I can't.</i>

10:48.383 --> 10:51.522
I'll come. I just have to finish the cord.
It'll take two minutes.

10:51.556 --> 10:54.161
Then I'll come with you, even
if it's just the two of us.

10:54.194 --> 10:57.367
I love Margot, and I resent
you suggesting I don't.

10:57.400 --> 11:00.106
They say the Red Wolves
have fled to Mergel's Cave.

11:00.140 --> 11:02.547
Fled?

11:09.993 --> 11:12.333
Look!
A model of Mergel's Cave!

11:12.366 --> 11:14.503
We can use it
to make a plan!

12:32.626 --> 12:35.031
Which one of you is Wolf?

12:59.180 --> 13:02.554
I am... Wolf.

13:02.587 --> 13:05.493
You are Wolf,
the leader of the Red Wolves?

13:05.525 --> 13:08.766
Yes, I am
their leader.

13:08.800 --> 13:13.844
But who are you that risks his life
to ask such an obvious question?

13:13.877 --> 13:19.254
I am Cesare, and I'm not
worried about risks.

13:19.287 --> 13:22.160
I seek to join your men
and serve you.

13:22.193 --> 13:26.168
How do you expect to
earn a robber's trust?

13:26.200 --> 13:29.407
Obey you. Obey you.

13:29.440 --> 13:31.245
Obey you.

13:31.278 --> 13:33.415
Then obey me now.

13:33.448 --> 13:36.288
Starting now,

13:36.321 --> 13:40.296
every night you must perform a
task exactly as I describe it.

13:40.329 --> 13:42.867
Terrifying ordeals

13:42.900 --> 13:45.606
that have winnowed the
weaklings from our number

13:45.640 --> 13:48.346
since the days
of my father.

13:48.379 --> 13:51.452
If you pass through
this terrifying ordeal,

13:51.484 --> 13:53.390
you will then
earn the right...

13:53.423 --> 13:55.694
But only then...

13:55.727 --> 13:57.631
To rob by my side

13:57.663 --> 14:02.508
and wear the pelt
of the Red Wolves.

14:03.776 --> 14:05.914
I'm ready
for your worst.

15:40.036 --> 15:41.508
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

15:45.581 --> 15:48.488
You have earned
our trust and devotion.

15:48.521 --> 15:51.660
Welcome,
brother wolf.

16:26.998 --> 16:29.771
Saplingjack,
return tomorrow night

16:30.973 --> 16:32.576
and move that rock

16:32.610 --> 16:35.550
from there to here.

16:37.286 --> 16:40.292
And return
the night after that

16:40.325 --> 16:44.132
and drink the boiling water
from this cauldron.

16:44.165 --> 16:47.105
And again the night after

16:47.138 --> 16:51.515
to challenge this gazelle
to a foot race.

16:55.623 --> 16:59.298
Wouldn't that be a test
more worthy of the Red Wolves?

17:00.298 --> 17:02.836
Yes, saplingjack.

17:02.870 --> 17:04.574
Tomorrow night,

17:04.608 --> 17:08.048
and night after night
till you've earned our trust.

17:08.082 --> 17:11.755
And I'll tell you
when you've earned it.

17:11.788 --> 17:13.894
In the meantime,

17:13.925 --> 17:15.863
daybreak comes.

17:15.896 --> 17:17.935
Sleep among us if you will,

17:17.968 --> 17:20.307
<i>but not with us.</i>

17:23.780 --> 17:25.148
Come to sleep.

22:18.840 --> 22:20.643
I don't
understand you.

22:20.677 --> 22:23.584
You beg me to come meet you
here, you need to talk,

22:23.616 --> 22:25.820
and then you make me
wait for hours?

22:25.854 --> 22:27.892
A man could easily
kill you.

22:29.961 --> 22:33.236
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together

22:33.269 --> 22:35.540
for...

22:37.677 --> 22:40.817
Good evening. Thanks very much.
My name is...

22:40.852 --> 22:44.259
Got a little song for you.
Goes something like this.

25:46.190 --> 25:49.697
Master!

25:53.239 --> 25:56.012
Master!

26:31.782 --> 26:34.855
Thank you!
You've been a great audience.

26:34.889 --> 26:37.260
See you next time, everybody.
Drive carefully. Good night.

26:41.068 --> 26:42.938
You know
I love you anyway.

27:35.309 --> 27:38.584
See, now, that's a story.

27:38.617 --> 27:42.091
As for what's going on here
in this submarine,

27:44.930 --> 27:47.536
I don't know what it is,
but it makes me nervous.

27:54.047 --> 27:57.155
Hey, you know
the old joke...

27:57.187 --> 28:01.163
What's the difference between a woman
in a bathtub and a woman in church?

28:02.231 --> 28:04.035
Give you a clue.

28:04.068 --> 28:08.078
The woman in church
has hope in her soul.

28:09.948 --> 28:12.585
Be careful about passing gas
when you're in the bathtub.

28:12.619 --> 28:14.623
It doesn't just go away.

28:42.779 --> 28:46.455
Look. He hasn't even
eaten his flapjacks.

28:46.487 --> 28:48.325
He is not here.

28:50.061 --> 28:51.531
Everything's chained
and locked.

28:51.564 --> 28:53.501
We shouldn't be in here.

28:59.479 --> 29:02.287
His mother's room.
He sleeps there sometimes.

29:03.655 --> 29:07.030
The fights they have!

29:07.063 --> 29:10.201
It's an old struggle
with scars on both sides.

29:10.235 --> 29:15.312
Hot magma
flows between them,

29:15.344 --> 29:18.584
for the whole earth
is not solid,

29:18.618 --> 29:23.162
but everywhere
gaping and hollowed

29:23.195 --> 29:25.600
with empty rooms and spaces

29:26.467 --> 29:28.505
and hidden burrows.

30:37.744 --> 30:40.918
Let's get that parachute
on you!

30:40.950 --> 30:42.855
Sorry about that.

31:03.764 --> 31:06.237
Who are you? Go!

31:23.937 --> 31:28.680
Dream, volcano.
This is for you.

31:30.484 --> 31:31.888
Fish.

31:34.558 --> 31:36.696
Fowl.

31:36.731 --> 31:38.835
Psst. Psst.

31:42.675 --> 31:44.680
Tire.

31:52.762 --> 31:54.733
Hip necklace.

31:57.671 --> 32:00.678
Sweet tapioca.

35:40.620 --> 35:42.492
"Gardener boy sought."

35:44.229 --> 35:46.267
Is good for me.

36:46.153 --> 36:48.158
What you do hear?

36:55.671 --> 37:00.381
Why can't I tell you something
that you will actually remember?

37:02.085 --> 37:05.492
Nothing is ever the past.

37:05.525 --> 37:07.496
He has past.

37:09.132 --> 37:11.036
Yes.

41:52.703 --> 41:54.039
No!

41:55.308 --> 41:56.946
No, I...

45:50.581 --> 45:52.319
No!

47:27.009 --> 47:30.850
Devil! Devil! Devil!

47:33.389 --> 47:35.861
Devil! Devil! Devil!

47:38.666 --> 47:40.704
Knock, knock, knock.

47:42.607 --> 47:44.245
Devil!

47:54.597 --> 48:00.009
Please accept
my most humble apologies,

48:00.043 --> 48:01.245
poor, beleaguered

48:01.246 --> 48:02.447
Devil!

48:02.480 --> 48:04.886
-And most lovely fellow traveler.
-Devil! Devil!

48:07.691 --> 48:09.629
I am Deane. Dr. Deane.

48:11.700 --> 48:13.604
Train psychiatrist.

48:15.641 --> 48:20.517
And I'm afraid that the man
who is disturbing your peace

48:20.550 --> 48:22.153
with those unearthly howls

48:22.154 --> 48:23.757
Devil!

48:23.790 --> 48:25.528
Is my responsibility.

48:25.560 --> 48:27.030
He is my patient.
Quite mad.

48:29.535 --> 48:32.676
And I am taking him on
to Bogotá.

48:33.943 --> 48:35.848
I assure you...

48:37.819 --> 48:40.056
he is harmless.

48:42.494 --> 48:47.438
Though I'm sure it doesn't seem
so to a young lady like you.

48:56.189 --> 48:58.561
I just wanted to...

49:09.015 --> 49:11.587
I've come to offer you
sanctuary.

49:11.619 --> 49:13.523
My compartment
in the next car

49:13.557 --> 49:17.165
is as quiet as a...

49:17.197 --> 49:19.535
Devil! Devil!

49:19.570 --> 49:21.006
-Humidor.
-Devil!

49:23.677 --> 49:26.049
And,

49:26.083 --> 49:28.221
I would feel so much better
if we traded.

49:29.924 --> 49:31.895
I could be closer
to my patient.

49:31.928 --> 49:34.198
You could have
the peace you deserve.

49:39.042 --> 49:41.080
On the return trip
to Berlin,

49:41.113 --> 49:44.152
the train will be
as your garden.

49:45.656 --> 49:48.729
No madman, I promise.

49:48.762 --> 49:51.768
Devil! Devil! Devil!

50:06.998 --> 50:08.903
I've lost my childhood?

50:10.839 --> 50:12.242
You were...

50:13.813 --> 50:16.083
robbed of it.

51:44.294 --> 51:47.166
After careful listening,

51:48.402 --> 51:50.239
thoughtful...

51:50.274 --> 51:54.348
and meticulous
reconstruction

51:54.381 --> 51:58.791
and everything only I can

51:58.823 --> 52:01.094
bring to bear
in our professional,

52:02.331 --> 52:05.837
<i>and so much more
than professional</i>

52:05.870 --> 52:07.975
friendship,

52:10.112 --> 52:13.554
I must now insist
that you close your eyes...

52:15.959 --> 52:18.831
and await

52:18.864 --> 52:22.270
what next I will

52:22.304 --> 52:25.011
reveal to you

52:26.246 --> 52:27.582
as...

52:29.385 --> 52:31.222
most...

52:33.025 --> 52:35.196
pleasantly euphoric

52:35.230 --> 52:37.602
surprise...

52:37.635 --> 52:40.273
of your young,

52:42.411 --> 52:44.917
<i>young...</i>

52:46.386 --> 52:48.156
life.

52:55.704 --> 52:59.980
I present you...

53:00.647 --> 53:04.054
your inner...

53:04.087 --> 53:06.126
child.

53:29.406 --> 53:31.676
It's okay.

53:33.381 --> 53:35.218
Stop. Stop.

53:35.251 --> 53:37.690
There, there.

54:57.249 --> 55:02.561
I'm afraid I must tell you,
prisoners, boys,

55:02.594 --> 55:06.435
that you all suffer from an
extremely rare form of amnesia,

55:06.467 --> 55:09.274
an illness that leaves
your memory unaffected

55:09.307 --> 55:12.680
but which nevertheless affects the
memories of your friends and families.

55:25.372 --> 55:29.614
You may find yourselves totally
forgotten when you return home.

55:29.648 --> 55:32.421
It is called
pan-fallopian neglect amnesia.

55:32.453 --> 55:34.960
There is little hope
for a cure.

01:01:11.268 --> 01:01:12.639
What should I do?

01:02:22.847 --> 01:02:26.087
Doctor. Doctor.

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:28.290
Other side of the mill.

01:04:54.952 --> 01:04:57.057
<i>Hello!</i>

01:06:03.558 --> 01:06:05.762
Aha.
So we have caught you.

01:06:05.794 --> 01:06:09.034
You thought you would get
away, but you did not!

01:06:09.067 --> 01:06:12.074
You will face the justice
of the volcano.

01:06:14.846 --> 01:06:16.917
Beautiful volcano.

01:06:20.191 --> 01:06:24.867
To liberate, volcano,
dream the molten dream

01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:27.006
of justice.

01:06:27.039 --> 01:06:29.676
Dream, volcano.

01:06:30.210 --> 01:06:31.915
Dream!

01:07:23.851 --> 01:07:26.190
Volcanoes are nothing
but the vent holes

01:07:26.224 --> 01:07:29.131
for breath pipes of nature
to give vent

01:07:29.163 --> 01:07:32.836
to the superfluous
choking fumes

01:07:32.869 --> 01:07:34.941
and smoking vapors

01:07:34.975 --> 01:07:37.114
which fly upwards.

01:07:56.451 --> 01:07:59.792
Hey. Did you ever hear the one about
the man who checked into a hotel room

01:07:59.825 --> 01:08:02.931
and got into the tub
and farted?

01:08:02.965 --> 01:08:06.370
The bellhop heard him, and brought
him a bottle of beer on a tray.

01:08:06.403 --> 01:08:08.910
The man said,
"Hey, I didn't order that."

01:08:08.942 --> 01:08:11.115
The bellhop said,
"You did too.

01:08:11.147 --> 01:08:16.158
I distinctly heard you say, 'Bellboy,
bring me a bottle of Bud.'"

01:08:27.948 --> 01:08:30.487
Is she alive?

01:08:30.519 --> 01:08:33.560
I-I can't tell.

01:08:33.593 --> 01:08:35.231
Check her pulse.

01:08:48.488 --> 01:08:50.225
<i>Master!</i>

01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:54.100
<i>Hello!</i>

01:08:55.236 --> 01:08:57.073
He's not here.

01:08:57.107 --> 01:08:59.111
One hour left.

01:09:01.281 --> 01:09:03.152
No more talking, just...

01:09:04.354 --> 01:09:05.926
breathing.

01:09:14.910 --> 01:09:19.251
<i>Breathing... breathing...</i>

01:09:19.285 --> 01:09:23.894
<i>breathing... breathing...</i>

01:09:23.928 --> 01:09:26.968
<i>breathing...
breathing... brea...</i>

01:09:30.941 --> 01:09:33.279
Wait! I haven't finished
telling you.

01:09:33.314 --> 01:09:36.487
The forest. The snow.

01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:41.296
The convict. The birthday.

01:10:13.561 --> 01:10:15.766
Why do you stand
with your eyes skyward?

01:10:15.799 --> 01:10:18.137
I've shot an arrow,

01:10:18.169 --> 01:10:20.075
and I'm waiting
for it to reappear.

01:10:22.678 --> 01:10:26.219
Forget your arrow. I am without
a companion. Come with me.

01:10:29.827 --> 01:10:31.431
I will come.

01:10:56.346 --> 01:11:00.089
Why do you tie these great
rocks to your ankles?

01:11:00.121 --> 01:11:02.225
I wish to chase buffalo,

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:05.131
yet every time I do,
I go beyond them,

01:11:05.165 --> 01:11:07.203
and so I'm tying
these stones to my feet

01:11:07.235 --> 01:11:09.239
so that I may not
run so fast.

01:11:10.775 --> 01:11:13.782
My friend,
you can run some other time.

01:11:13.815 --> 01:11:15.418
Come with us.

01:11:50.789 --> 01:11:53.228
What for do you listen
so earnestly?

01:11:54.631 --> 01:11:56.835
Forest is full of stone,

01:11:56.867 --> 01:11:58.840
and I'm listening
to its breathing.

01:11:59.574 --> 01:12:01.980
It whispers too.

01:12:02.013 --> 01:12:04.651
The ice has stories to tell.

01:12:07.457 --> 01:12:09.561
A long time ago...

01:12:09.593 --> 01:12:12.466
You know I love you anyway.

01:13:07.443 --> 01:13:08.914
Let's go to your place.

01:13:15.762 --> 01:13:18.033
<i>Hello!</i>

01:16:27.379 --> 01:16:29.117
<i>Le cygne.</i>

01:16:31.154 --> 01:16:33.159
The guitar turtle.

01:16:36.565 --> 01:16:38.236
The Chihuahua.

01:16:48.354 --> 01:16:51.829
Happy birthday, darling.

01:16:51.862 --> 01:16:53.031
You remembered.

01:16:53.032 --> 01:16:54.200
Yes.

01:16:54.234 --> 01:16:55.871
Look.

01:16:55.903 --> 01:16:59.579
I know you always admired my
taste, so this is for you.

01:16:59.611 --> 01:17:02.318
I looked everywhere... the city,
the country, high and low...

01:17:02.351 --> 01:17:06.593
And built a special collection
that is the identical of mine.

01:17:06.626 --> 01:17:10.434
The Chihuahua.
The guitar turtle.

01:17:10.466 --> 01:17:14.375
<i>The boar heads. Le cygne.
The embalmed flowers.</i>

01:17:14.407 --> 01:17:18.014
It was quite a task
to find exact duplicates.

01:17:18.048 --> 01:17:19.586
But where is your boar's head?

01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:21.623
What?

01:17:21.656 --> 01:17:23.093
And your Chihuahua.

01:17:24.494 --> 01:17:26.499
Thad, I don't get it.

01:17:27.902 --> 01:17:29.873
It's all gone!

01:17:29.906 --> 01:17:31.475
-It's been stolen!
-What?

01:17:31.509 --> 01:17:33.949
Those miserable thieves!

01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:37.488
-It's all right.
-Miserable thieves!

01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:40.093
What's going on here?
Are you all right?

01:17:40.126 --> 01:17:42.131
Miserable thieves!

01:17:42.163 --> 01:17:44.134
Come on! Come on.

01:17:49.144 --> 01:17:50.948
Sorry. Did you steal
my boar's head?

01:17:53.486 --> 01:17:56.159
I didn't steal anything, sir.

01:17:56.191 --> 01:17:59.265
Yes, but my wife
will think that you did.

01:18:01.437 --> 01:18:03.340
Sir, I did not.

01:18:03.372 --> 01:18:04.944
Sir!

01:20:34.010 --> 01:20:36.349
I lean in close,

01:20:36.381 --> 01:20:39.788
and she runs
the peaks of her fingers

01:20:39.821 --> 01:20:44.265
along the dry strings
of my mustache.

01:20:49.908 --> 01:20:52.480
And all I say

01:20:52.513 --> 01:20:55.954
is yes, no,

01:20:58.626 --> 01:20:59.963
maybe.

01:22:23.864 --> 01:22:25.033
Are you hungry?

01:22:29.675 --> 01:22:30.946
<i>Yes.</i>

01:22:51.820 --> 01:22:52.689
<i>No.</i>

01:23:02.007 --> 01:23:03.645
Enjoy your breakfast.

01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:07.586
<i>Yes.</i>

01:23:07.618 --> 01:23:10.191
Would you like to listen
to your program?

01:23:11.927 --> 01:23:15.568
Would you? Is it time for
your favorite program?

01:23:18.074 --> 01:23:20.747
<i>Yes.</i>

01:23:29.328 --> 01:23:31.867
<i>I heard it on the radio itself,</i>

01:23:31.901 --> 01:23:34.841
<i>the wars
that tore the planishings.</i>

01:23:34.874 --> 01:23:36.294
<i>You're lying.</i>

01:23:36.295 --> 01:23:37.714
<i>I do not lie.</i>

01:23:37.747 --> 01:23:40.386
<i>You would shoot
at your own shadow,</i>

01:23:40.419 --> 01:23:42.257
<i>or voices in the woods.</i>

01:23:43.357 --> 01:23:47.299
<i>We shoot
whether we like it or not.</i>

01:23:47.333 --> 01:23:49.671
<i>We have a lot
to shoot with.</i>

01:23:52.410 --> 01:23:56.986
<i>We draw blood from you and cut
out all the scars of your past.</i>

01:23:59.290 --> 01:24:01.195
<i>Go ahead. Condemn.</i>

01:24:01.996 --> 01:24:03.699
<i>You cannibals.</i>

01:24:04.734 --> 01:24:07.040
<i>We will
cut them loose.</i>

01:24:07.072 --> 01:24:10.379
<i>Look. You cry.</i>

01:24:11.815 --> 01:24:14.320
<i>That's right.</i>

01:24:14.352 --> 01:24:16.090
<i>Why are you crying?</i>

01:24:17.326 --> 01:24:19.831
<i>You dare to cry.</i>

01:24:19.865 --> 01:24:22.102
<i>I can see your tears.</i>

01:24:22.136 --> 01:24:23.707
<i>Curse you.</i>

01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:26.144
<i>Quietly. Quietly.</i>

01:24:26.176 --> 01:24:30.018
<i>Into a trance you're born,
right before your own eyes.</i>

01:24:31.922 --> 01:24:34.762
<i>I don't want to talk to you.
Let me alone.</i>

01:24:36.131 --> 01:24:38.970
<i>I want to think
before I die.</i>

01:24:39.937 --> 01:24:41.476
<i>The world is ours.</i>

01:24:43.278 --> 01:24:45.818
<i>Not ours.</i>

01:24:49.991 --> 01:24:51.362
<i>No.</i>

01:25:04.353 --> 01:25:05.890
<i>Maybe.</i>

01:25:07.494 --> 01:25:09.364
<i>No.</i>

01:25:22.590 --> 01:25:23.994
<i>Yes.</i>

01:25:30.608 --> 01:25:32.344
<i>No.</i>

01:25:39.357 --> 01:25:40.894
<i>No.</i>

01:25:43.232 --> 01:25:44.570
<i>Yes.</i>

01:27:06.700 --> 01:27:09.707
<i>I was the junior
chargé d'affaires,</i>

01:27:09.739 --> 01:27:12.078
<i>not yet the master
of myself,</i>

01:27:12.112 --> 01:27:14.482
<i>in consular service
at the town of B...,</i>

01:27:14.516 --> 01:27:19.160
<i>a young man of light consigned
to a dark, dark outpost,</i>

01:27:19.192 --> 01:27:23.768
<i>when one day I found myself upon
the threshold of an antique shop.</i>

01:28:30.001 --> 01:28:32.207
I have a present for you.

01:28:33.007 --> 01:28:34.610
How thrilling.

01:28:34.643 --> 01:28:36.314
It's heavy.

01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:41.257
Let me open it.

01:28:54.918 --> 01:28:56.856
Why does it have
two faces?

01:28:56.888 --> 01:28:59.360
It is the god Janus.

01:28:59.394 --> 01:29:01.533
I've never heard of him.

01:29:02.734 --> 01:29:04.505
He is the god
of thresholds.

01:29:04.538 --> 01:29:07.878
But of course,
not only thresholds, no.

01:29:07.911 --> 01:29:10.349
Thresholds, yes,
but many other things besides.

01:29:10.383 --> 01:29:12.320
He is the god of beginnings,

01:29:12.354 --> 01:29:13.923
of transitions,
of gates and doors.

01:29:13.955 --> 01:29:16.695
He looks into the past
and into the future.

01:29:16.729 --> 01:29:18.400
He is the god
of two-sided coins.

01:29:18.433 --> 01:29:20.871
The month of January
is named in his honor.

01:29:20.903 --> 01:29:23.475
He presides over the sun,
the moon, over bridges

01:29:23.509 --> 01:29:26.349
and time and movement.

01:29:26.382 --> 01:29:29.789
When drawn bridges unfurl for an
arriving procession of noble explorers,

01:29:29.822 --> 01:29:33.496
when gates un-gate at the beck
of a charitable king's whim,

01:29:33.528 --> 01:29:36.401
when... when time moves on,
all of time ticking,

01:29:36.434 --> 01:29:39.374
it is Janus, Janus, Janus,
the motive force.

01:29:39.408 --> 01:29:42.715
Always facing frontward and
back, north and south,

01:29:42.747 --> 01:29:44.985
defiantly facing
Notos and Boreas.

01:29:45.018 --> 01:29:47.758
Yes!

01:29:47.792 --> 01:29:49.062
With a quick pivot
east and west too,

01:29:50.463 --> 01:29:52.334
the sun's fanfare
and refuge.

01:29:56.108 --> 01:30:00.117
He is...
that kind of god.

01:30:00.149 --> 01:30:03.122
When omens caution,

01:30:03.156 --> 01:30:04.927
when auspices beckon,

01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:07.698
it is Janus we praise.

01:30:09.569 --> 01:30:11.741
Certain traditions have

01:30:13.108 --> 01:30:16.048
Simon Peter
guarding heaven's gate.

01:30:17.216 --> 01:30:18.820
But no.

01:30:20.890 --> 01:30:22.962
Such heavenly keeping

01:30:22.994 --> 01:30:24.900
is the work of Janus.

01:30:29.675 --> 01:30:32.681
It's ugly
and frightening.

01:30:32.714 --> 01:30:34.152
Take it away, please.

01:30:41.933 --> 01:30:44.572
<i>I brooded over
Jane's rejection of my gift</i>

01:30:44.605 --> 01:30:48.514
<i>and plunged myself
into a brown study over Janus,</i>

01:30:48.546 --> 01:30:50.551
<i>that great god.</i>

01:30:53.824 --> 01:30:56.095
<i>God's the terminus
of the ways of the road.</i>

01:30:56.129 --> 01:30:58.200
<i>Master of time.</i>

01:31:38.780 --> 01:31:42.288
<i>Convulsed into a monster
by the Janus bust,</i>

01:31:42.321 --> 01:31:47.600
<i>I was now Lug-Lug,
hideous impulse incarnate.</i>

01:32:53.065 --> 01:32:56.338
<i>I called at Jane's,
the scene of my cruel crime,</i>

01:32:56.371 --> 01:32:58.742
<i>hoping she had somehow
recovered from,</i>

01:32:58.776 --> 01:33:01.817
<i>or even forgotten,
the previous night's attack.</i>

01:33:13.471 --> 01:33:15.375
Sewing.

01:33:15.409 --> 01:33:17.047
Stitching.

01:33:18.047 --> 01:33:20.386
Darning. Mending.

01:33:24.026 --> 01:33:26.366
Sweeping.

01:33:26.399 --> 01:33:29.137
Scrubbing. Washing.

01:34:24.148 --> 01:34:27.188
I'll give you 200 for it.

01:34:29.726 --> 01:34:32.933
All right, do I have 200?
I have two... 200? I have 200.

01:34:32.966 --> 01:34:36.139
225. I have... Do I have 250 for
this excellent two-faced Roman...

01:34:36.171 --> 01:34:38.945
250. I have 250.
325 right here.

01:34:38.977 --> 01:34:40.514
325. I have 325.

01:34:40.547 --> 01:34:43.620
375, ladies and gentlemen.
375 for this sculpture.

01:34:43.654 --> 01:34:46.091
You're not gonna see a second one
like this for years to come.

01:34:46.125 --> 01:34:48.664
<i>From the bowels of hell!
Now what?</i>

01:34:48.696 --> 01:34:50.134
No, no, no. 375.

01:34:50.167 --> 01:34:53.407
<i>To further complicate matters,
my own double...</i>

01:34:53.439 --> 01:34:56.012
<i>Of all people...
Arrived at the night auction</i>

01:34:56.045 --> 01:34:59.185
<i>to bid against me
for the Janus bust.</i>

01:34:59.219 --> 01:35:02.258
500. Do I have 500? No...
500! 500!

01:35:02.291 --> 01:35:05.398
Do I hear 525?
Five... 525.

01:35:05.431 --> 01:35:07.301
550? I have 550.

01:35:07.335 --> 01:35:10.074
575. I have 575. 600!
I have 600.

01:35:10.107 --> 01:35:13.147
625?
I have 625. 650?

01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:15.117
I'm looking for 650.
625.

01:35:15.151 --> 01:35:17.188
Going once. Going twice.
Three times.

01:35:17.221 --> 01:35:19.393
And the god is sold.

01:35:19.425 --> 01:35:23.133
<i>I won back the unhallowed
trophy from my double.</i>

01:35:23.167 --> 01:35:25.238
<i>Soundly thrashed
in the bidding,</i>

01:35:25.270 --> 01:35:29.278
<i>the repulsive duplicate wandered
off to God knows where.</i>

01:35:29.312 --> 01:35:33.755
<i>Irked at his very existence,
I compelled myself to stalk him</i>

01:35:33.787 --> 01:35:37.495
<i>as Lug-Lug!</i>

01:35:59.773 --> 01:36:03.482
Wait. Before you do
what you must do...

01:36:03.514 --> 01:36:05.519
For I'm sure
you have your reasons...

01:36:05.551 --> 01:36:08.591
Allow me one word
in my own defense.

01:36:08.625 --> 01:36:13.667
Not because I deserve any, for I am sure
whatever it is you think I have done,

01:36:13.701 --> 01:36:17.143
I have done it 10 times
worse than you even know.

01:36:17.175 --> 01:36:20.648
But please, allow me
one short story

01:36:20.682 --> 01:36:24.390
by way of illustrating
your own convictions.

01:36:25.792 --> 01:36:27.763
<i>Preparing to spend
the night at H...,</i>

01:36:27.797 --> 01:36:30.302
<i>on my way through
southern T...,</i>

01:36:30.335 --> 01:36:34.912
<i>I engaged a horse groomsman to currycomb
the fatigue from my Dutch Gelderlander,</i>

01:36:34.944 --> 01:36:37.350
<i>which I had that day
ridden hard.</i>

01:36:38.351 --> 01:36:39.788
<i>At the threshold of the stables,</i>

01:36:39.821 --> 01:36:42.226
<i>the ostler accosted me
with a tale.</i>

01:36:43.795 --> 01:36:45.532
<i>Just four birthdays ago...</i>

01:36:45.565 --> 01:36:47.670
<i>-I'm sorry, sir.
-I haven't the time this evening.</i>

01:36:47.704 --> 01:36:49.541
<i>-My mother...
-Step aside, I beg you.</i>

01:36:49.574 --> 01:36:52.347
<i>One night I was sent
for her medicine.</i>

01:36:52.380 --> 01:36:55.420
Ostler!

01:37:00.696 --> 01:37:03.369
<i>At the pharmacist's,
I met her.</i>

01:37:08.378 --> 01:37:09.747
<i>Felicia.</i>

01:37:11.551 --> 01:37:13.957
<i>I felt she needed my help.</i>

01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:16.361
<i>She asked for laudanum.</i>

01:37:16.395 --> 01:37:18.900
<i>The druggist tossed her
out on the street.</i>

01:37:30.388 --> 01:37:32.761
<i>I gave her half
Mother's laudanum,</i>

01:37:36.401 --> 01:37:38.573
Mother, I have it.

01:37:38.606 --> 01:37:39.709
I have it.

01:37:42.046 --> 01:37:44.318
Be quiet.

01:37:45.619 --> 01:37:47.056
It's your birthday,
little ostler.

01:37:47.090 --> 01:37:49.595
Have you anything
you want to tell me?

01:37:50.863 --> 01:37:53.302
No, Mother. No.

01:37:54.939 --> 01:37:56.810
You should
take some more.

01:38:31.746 --> 01:38:34.819
<i>And then I have her three-quarters
of Mother's laudanum</i>

01:38:36.489 --> 01:38:38.394
<i>and filled the rest
with water.</i>

01:38:51.886 --> 01:38:56.129
<i>Breathing... breathing...</i>

01:38:56.162 --> 01:39:00.037
<i>breathing... breathing...</i>

01:39:00.069 --> 01:39:02.106
<i>breathing...
breathing...</i>

01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:05.648
<i>And then I have her
all of Mother's laudanum</i>

01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:07.985
<i>and gave my mother water.</i>

01:39:58.922 --> 01:40:00.893
Thank you for listening.

01:40:00.925 --> 01:40:02.896
Please,

01:40:02.930 --> 01:40:04.800
get on with it.

01:40:08.975 --> 01:40:11.981
<i>Self-mastery at last!</i>

01:41:24.294 --> 01:41:26.899
One moment, please.

01:41:30.372 --> 01:41:31.742
Come in.

01:41:33.045 --> 01:41:35.150
The Minister
of the Interior.

01:41:40.994 --> 01:41:44.368
Well, no. Yes.
This is not my fault.

01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:46.405
There's an explanation,
clearly.

01:41:46.437 --> 01:41:48.341
Don't you see? I...

01:41:48.375 --> 01:41:51.581
He... She tried
to murder me!

01:41:53.551 --> 01:41:56.826
She tried to strangle me
with her blouse.

01:41:56.859 --> 01:41:59.565
And this butler...
It was his idea.

01:41:59.599 --> 01:42:01.368
He organized everything.

01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:03.005
Please!

01:42:04.074 --> 01:42:05.443
No!

01:42:06.646 --> 01:42:09.117
No! Aaah!

01:42:11.521 --> 01:42:13.526
Surprise!

01:43:44.676 --> 01:43:46.080
Aswang.

01:44:18.645 --> 01:44:20.883
<i>You have never been baptized.</i>

01:44:20.916 --> 01:44:22.687
I can help you.

01:45:20.302 --> 01:45:21.873
Such is the tale
of the snow.

01:45:24.511 --> 01:45:27.250
You may listen again
when the occasion arises.

01:45:28.418 --> 01:45:30.523
Come and join us.

01:49:56.926 --> 01:49:59.499
What's the meaning
of this?

01:54:12.740 --> 01:54:14.711
I found you.

01:54:16.649 --> 01:54:18.553
The captain's daughter.

01:54:19.621 --> 01:54:21.526
My only memory.

01:54:30.610 --> 01:54:32.046
<i>Dreams.</i>

01:54:34.384 --> 01:54:35.853
Visions.

01:54:36.889 --> 01:54:38.860
Madness!

01:54:42.033 --> 01:54:44.105
Breathing...

01:54:44.138 --> 01:54:48.079
breathing...
breathing...

01:54:48.111 --> 01:54:51.886
breathing... breathing...

01:54:56.762 --> 01:54:58.633
<i>Once you're done,</i>

01:54:58.665 --> 01:55:03.142
<i>you wanna dry yourself
on a big, fluffy Turkish towel.</i>

01:55:03.175 --> 01:55:06.783
The Turks were heavily
into baths too,

01:55:06.817 --> 01:55:10.424
hence the expression, "Hoo! It's
like a Turkish bath in here."

01:55:10.457 --> 01:55:15.600
Now, you probably want to
curl up with a nice book,

01:55:15.634 --> 01:55:19.041
or maybe get together
with a special someone

01:55:19.074 --> 01:55:23.451
who, hopefully, will have bathed
too in the fairly recent past.

01:55:23.483 --> 01:55:26.122
Whatever. Enjoy.

01:55:27.624 --> 01:55:30.730
That's what bathing
is all about,

01:55:30.764 --> 01:55:33.671
in spite of what you may
have heard to the contrary.

01:55:33.703 --> 01:55:35.139
Have a nice day.
