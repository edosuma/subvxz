00:07.302 --> 00:09.545
- Good afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

00:10.430 --> 00:15.471
- What'll you have, Normie?
- A 1 929 Lafitte Rothschild, Coach.

00:15.643 --> 00:17.885
Or a beer,
whatever everyone's having.

00:18.062 --> 00:22.770
Haven't heard much lately about your
quest to sire an heir for the old throne.

00:22.940 --> 00:25.942
- So how goeth the baby-making?
- Not good.

00:26.110 --> 00:30.189
Vera thinks it's my fault she's not
pregnant. Says l'm not trying.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.522
l hope before you answered harshly,

00:32.698 --> 00:37.076
you took into account her frustration
in the maternal instinct department.

00:37.245 --> 00:41.028
- l said, ''Drop dead in a ditch.''
- Perfect.

00:42.415 --> 00:46.709
l used to think that sleeping was the
greatest pleasure you could have in bed.

00:46.878 --> 00:48.955
Now l'm sure of it.

00:49.130 --> 00:53.128
Norm, what's the matter?
Don't you like having sex with your wife?

00:53.301 --> 00:57.131
We're not exactly what each other
wants in a sexual partner.

00:57.303 --> 01:02.131
For example, she wishes l looked
a little more like Charles Bronson.

01:02.308 --> 01:06.636
And l wish she looked a little less
like Charles Bronson.

02:21.583 --> 02:24.500
Carla, what do you think
of my new cologne?

02:26.587 --> 02:28.876
- What do you think?
- l like it.

02:29.049 --> 02:31.883
When will l be able to see again?

02:32.051 --> 02:33.249
Thank you.

02:33.427 --> 02:36.630
- You have customers waiting.
- Right away.

02:36.805 --> 02:39.722
Will someone lead me to them?

02:39.891 --> 02:42.216
- White wine, please.
- White wine.

02:43.603 --> 02:46.141
Coach, l'll handle this one.

02:46.313 --> 02:48.850
l hope this doesn't embarrass you
too much,

02:49.023 --> 02:53.187
but you have the most
beautiful eyes that l have ever seen.

02:53.362 --> 02:57.228
l kinda get flustered, but it's nice to hear.

02:58.990 --> 03:02.857
lf l said you had a beautiful body,
would you hold it against me?

03:03.035 --> 03:05.407
Even l've heard that one.

03:05.579 --> 03:10.655
l'm not doing too well with my patter.
Maybe l ought to rely on my looks.

03:10.834 --> 03:12.957
Have you seen this one?

03:13.753 --> 03:17.370
l guess l'm just a sucker
for sophistication.

03:17.547 --> 03:22.376
Now l've charmed your socks off,
wanna go to dinner with me?

03:22.553 --> 03:25.589
You know a place
that doesn't require socks?

03:25.763 --> 03:28.514
l could find one. So what do you say?

03:28.681 --> 03:32.347
l can't leave yet.
l came to see somebody.

03:32.518 --> 03:33.977
Who?

03:39.733 --> 03:41.560
So you two know each other, huh?

03:42.861 --> 03:45.316
Nothing gets by this guy.

03:47.699 --> 03:52.158
Sam, this is my friend Amanda Boyer.
Amanda, this is my friend, Sam Malone.

03:52.327 --> 03:56.574
You're gonna have to excuse us here,
l think we're on our way out to dinner.

03:56.749 --> 04:01.290
Actually, l came by to see you.
You wanna have lunch sometime?

04:01.460 --> 04:04.460
Lunch sometime...
Are you two going out together?

04:04.628 --> 04:07.998
You're pretty sharp yourself there,
Diane.

04:08.174 --> 04:12.218
Before you do, could l speak with you
about a problem, Sam?

04:12.385 --> 04:15.303
- Trouble in the back room.
- lt's not about me, is it?

04:15.471 --> 04:17.428
Don't be silly.

04:17.599 --> 04:20.351
That woman's a mess.

04:23.311 --> 04:27.095
- Don't go out with her.
- Why not?

04:27.273 --> 04:31.105
l can't tell you now.
Just trust me for once.

04:31.278 --> 04:33.814
You'll have to give me a hint.

04:35.323 --> 04:38.109
l really can't say anything.

04:38.283 --> 04:42.151
l can't believe
you're so blatantly jealous.

04:42.329 --> 04:45.994
You still can't stand the sight
of me with another woman, huh?

04:46.166 --> 04:50.411
My heart goes out to any living creature
in your company.

04:52.212 --> 04:54.500
One of these days you're gonna realise

04:54.672 --> 04:59.796
that if you want to get back together
with me, you'll have to talk a little nicer.

04:59.968 --> 05:02.376
Sam...

05:02.554 --> 05:08.674
- You are an unmitigated egomaniac.
- Too little, too late.

05:09.268 --> 05:10.596
Good night.

05:16.607 --> 05:18.897
You know, Normie, l was just thinking.

05:19.069 --> 05:23.196
When you and Vera have the baby,
you'll have to give it a name, right?

05:23.364 --> 05:25.735
We might name it, yeah.

05:26.950 --> 05:31.030
When it comes time to name the baby,
you should consider Barry.

05:31.203 --> 05:33.279
What's so special about Barry?

05:33.456 --> 05:36.825
He's a whizz with names.
He gave me my nickname.

05:37.834 --> 05:40.918
- Coach?
- What?

05:42.463 --> 05:44.207
Never mind.

05:44.382 --> 05:48.046
As l was saying,
Barry gave me my nickname, Coach.

05:48.219 --> 05:52.962
That was inventive. You were a coach,
so he called you Coach.

05:53.139 --> 05:55.298
You know, you're probably right, Larry.

05:55.475 --> 06:00.633
l always thought he gave me the name
because l never flew first class.

06:05.858 --> 06:09.772
We won't need Barry's help.
We've got a list of names to fight over.

06:09.946 --> 06:13.776
Once the baby's born
we'll fight over boy names or girl names.

06:13.948 --> 06:19.949
You don't have to wait
till the baby's born if you use sonar.

06:20.954 --> 06:23.823
Yeah, Sonar's a beautiful name.

06:26.167 --> 06:28.657
- Hey, everybody.
- Sam.

06:28.835 --> 06:31.291
What happened?
That was a long dinner.

06:31.463 --> 06:35.673
This is pitiful, you wearing
your heart on your sleeve like that.

06:35.841 --> 06:39.257
- How did you and Amanda get along?
- She's OK, l guess.

06:39.427 --> 06:45.262
Not triple A, but the food was good and
she's got pretty good table manners.

06:45.432 --> 06:49.596
High praise from a man who thinks
mashed potatoes are finger food.

06:50.395 --> 06:54.855
So you didn't make any plans
to see each other again?

06:55.024 --> 06:58.607
l like it when a woman is hot for me,
but this is ridiculous.

06:58.777 --> 07:01.944
lt's not your business,
but l might call her again.

07:02.114 --> 07:03.940
Oh, no.

07:05.325 --> 07:09.109
l wish Frasier weren't
at that nerve-ending symposium.

07:09.287 --> 07:12.821
l guess l have to tell you the truth.

07:12.998 --> 07:15.454
Amanda and l became friends at...

07:16.751 --> 07:18.790
...a place.

07:18.963 --> 07:22.911
That's pretty fascinating.
You'll have to fill me in on that later.

07:23.089 --> 07:25.627
The place was Goldenbrook.

07:25.801 --> 07:28.587
The booby hatch?

07:28.761 --> 07:32.759
Oh, no, she looked so normal.

07:32.931 --> 07:35.220
Were you guys cellmates or something?

07:36.726 --> 07:39.265
There are no cells at Goldenbrook.

07:39.437 --> 07:43.564
l was there of my own volition
as were a lot of other normal people

07:43.732 --> 07:48.440
who just needed a little time
to rest and sort out their feelings

07:48.611 --> 07:51.280
under constant psychiatric supervision.

07:53.949 --> 07:57.567
l shouldn't even be talking to you.

07:57.744 --> 08:01.408
She wouldn't be out
if she still had problems.

08:01.581 --> 08:03.408
You're out.

08:08.545 --> 08:11.914
What exactly is wrong with that kid?

08:12.089 --> 08:15.340
l didn't want to say because
we did group therapy together

08:15.510 --> 08:18.795
and l didn't want to violate
her confidence.

08:18.971 --> 08:24.011
l guess l have to tell you now.
Please don't ever tell another soul.

08:25.643 --> 08:30.933
- Amanda is obsessive with men.
- Oh, my God, no!

08:32.732 --> 08:36.600
Wait a second. What does that mean,
exactly? She likes men a lot?

08:36.778 --> 08:39.813
When she decides she wants a man,

08:39.988 --> 08:45.742
she becomes excessively preoccupied
and possessive, and totally irrational.

08:45.910 --> 08:48.402
Oh, you mean kinda like you...landa.

08:48.579 --> 08:51.948
Yolanda Johnson. You don't know her.
Very obsessive woman.

08:53.834 --> 08:57.036
She is nothing like Youlanda.

08:57.837 --> 08:59.960
Listen, l wasn't thinking about it,

09:00.131 --> 09:05.172
but if l ever do go out with her again,
the first sign of trouble, l'll back off. OK?

09:05.343 --> 09:10.384
Wait a second, what's an example
of obsessive behaviour?

09:10.556 --> 09:16.760
Mom, Dad, there he is,
the man l'm gonna marry.

09:19.356 --> 09:21.478
This is an example.

09:29.697 --> 09:34.158
Sam, these are my parents,
Mona and Todd.

09:34.327 --> 09:38.739
- Hello, Sam.
- We've heard so much about you.

09:38.914 --> 09:40.657
When?

09:40.832 --> 09:45.292
On the drive over here.
lt was a long drive.

09:45.461 --> 09:49.328
- l feel like l know you.
- Daddy, stop it.

09:49.506 --> 09:54.001
Mom and Dad came to visit me and l
thought it'd be nice for them to meet you.

09:54.176 --> 09:58.921
- Can we have a word in private?
- Hi, Amanda. Mona, Todd.

09:59.097 --> 10:04.553
Sam l need to talk to you
about the inventory. We'll be right back.

10:05.811 --> 10:11.232
That girl looks familiar.
ls she the one l met on Basket Day?

10:12.275 --> 10:15.111
What were you going to do
when l interrupted?

10:15.278 --> 10:17.567
Get rid of her before this gets serious.

10:17.738 --> 10:21.950
Sam, better get out there. She's picking
silver patterns with her parents.

10:22.117 --> 10:26.778
Yeah, l told them fleurs-de-lis
are passÃ©, they won't listen to me.

10:29.081 --> 10:33.245
We're trying to have
a private conversation.

10:33.419 --> 10:36.622
We're not trying to be nosy,
just go ahead.

10:38.214 --> 10:40.337
Very well.

10:40.509 --> 10:46.380
You can't give her your standard
prearranged speech for dumping women.

10:46.554 --> 10:50.255
l do not have a standard prearranged
speech for dumping women.

10:50.433 --> 10:52.341
Every situation is different.

10:52.517 --> 10:56.811
For example, the speech l dumped you
with would be totally inappropriate.

10:59.190 --> 11:01.860
l don't think you dumped me.

11:02.026 --> 11:05.145
You see? That was the beauty of it.

11:06.364 --> 11:12.116
Come on, l couldn't possibly
have one speech for every situation.

11:12.285 --> 11:14.443
He's got six.

11:14.619 --> 11:17.953
l think this one calls for number three:

11:18.123 --> 11:21.208
''lt's times like these,
l'm ashamed to be a man.''

11:21.376 --> 11:24.412
- Get out!
- Wait a minute, Diane.

11:24.587 --> 11:28.714
Sam's a very close personal friend.
He's in a crisis and l don't think...

11:28.882 --> 11:31.254
OK, have a couple of beers on me.

11:43.352 --> 11:47.480
Sammy, you know where to find us
if you need any help.

11:49.900 --> 11:51.394
- Oh, boy.
- Sam...

11:52.069 --> 11:54.558
That woman out there is very vulnerable.

11:54.737 --> 11:59.980
Whatever you say to her
has to be sensitive and real.

12:00.159 --> 12:04.204
Otherwise the consequence
could be horrendous.

12:04.371 --> 12:07.040
What do you mean by that?

12:08.249 --> 12:12.198
She could do something ghastly again.

12:12.377 --> 12:14.916
- You don't mean...
- Yes, suicide.

12:15.088 --> 12:18.671
Oh, thank God!
l thought l was in danger there.

12:18.841 --> 12:22.674
No, that's not what l meant.
You're making me a nervous wreck.

12:22.845 --> 12:25.679
Just tell me what to say
so she doesn't hurt herself.

12:25.847 --> 12:28.421
- l wish l knew.
- Come on, come on.

12:28.599 --> 12:31.719
- She'll try to manipulate you.
- OK.

12:31.894 --> 12:33.887
Be strong. Don't waver.

12:34.063 --> 12:38.558
- And ease into the rejection gently.
- OK, do you think that'll work?

12:38.733 --> 12:41.817
lf not, have a nice honeymoon.

12:54.413 --> 12:57.699
- Hi, l'm sorry to keep you waiting.
- That's OK.

12:57.873 --> 13:02.121
They like you a lot.
You make a wonderful first impression.

13:02.295 --> 13:06.506
lt's my best one. Amanda, l...

13:06.674 --> 13:12.592
Please, please don't dump me!
Please, Sam, give me another chance.

13:12.762 --> 13:16.926
l shouldn't have brought my parents,
that was stupid and impulsive of me.

13:17.100 --> 13:19.851
l don't even like them,
l'll get rid of them.

13:20.019 --> 13:22.390
No, no. Wait.

13:22.562 --> 13:27.853
l was just gonna say l wonder
if they would like to have a drink.

13:32.778 --> 13:36.527
No, thank you, they don't drink.
But thank you for thinking of them.

13:36.699 --> 13:38.277
You're welcome.

13:38.451 --> 13:41.368
- Then l was gonna say...
- No! Please, Sam...

13:41.536 --> 13:46.875
Would you just please let me finish
before you jump to conclusions?

13:47.041 --> 13:49.711
Now just sit down
and don't say anything.

13:49.878 --> 13:52.203
Sorry.

13:53.131 --> 13:55.168
lt's OK.

14:00.177 --> 14:05.846
l like you and l respect you
too much not to be honest.

14:06.015 --> 14:08.507
Now l'm sorry if l misled you,

14:08.686 --> 14:11.970
but l just don't want to pursue
this relationship.

14:20.195 --> 14:23.812
l'm so embarrassed and ashamed...

14:24.907 --> 14:28.441
...and tired. l'm very tired.

14:29.703 --> 14:34.410
l'm sorry, Sam, for everything.
Goodbye, Sam.

14:35.541 --> 14:39.538
- Are you all right?
- Oh, sure.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.868
lt's my fault.

14:42.046 --> 14:43.920
You are such a nice guy.

14:44.090 --> 14:50.424
Please don't blame yourself
for anything that has ever happened.

14:56.934 --> 15:00.303
Or anything that's going to happen.

15:02.064 --> 15:04.934
Whoa, wait a second.

15:05.108 --> 15:07.432
What do you mean by that?

15:07.610 --> 15:13.979
Sam, you don't have to worry about me
any more. Remember? We're through.

15:14.157 --> 15:18.700
l didn't mean the bad 'through',
l meant the good 'through'.

15:19.620 --> 15:21.660
What's the good 'through'?

15:21.830 --> 15:27.453
That's where we would
go out to dinner right now

15:27.627 --> 15:31.376
and then maybe have a drive
down the Cape,

15:31.547 --> 15:33.503
and see each other tomorrow.

15:34.382 --> 15:39.377
The Cape would be pretty tonight.
l'd like that, Sam.

15:39.554 --> 15:43.800
There, you see how fun
'through' can be?

15:45.141 --> 15:49.054
l'll get my parents and we'll drop them off
at some bus stop.

15:53.149 --> 15:57.857
- You have another date with her, right?
- l wouldn't call it exactly a date.

15:58.028 --> 16:00.353
lt's more like a lifetime commitment.

16:13.582 --> 16:18.743
My goodness, you and Vera have
compiled quite a list of baby names.

16:18.921 --> 16:23.249
Yeah, we think up names
when we make love.

16:24.258 --> 16:27.508
lt kinda helps to pass the time.

16:29.430 --> 16:33.094
May l suggest you add one more
to the boys' list?

16:33.266 --> 16:37.762
- My favourite has always been Toby.
- Toby?

16:37.937 --> 16:43.096
Why don't you just name him Precious
or Pumpkin Pie and be done with it?

16:43.275 --> 16:48.269
My ex may not be a class act,
but he's got a first-rate male name, Nick.

16:48.446 --> 16:50.106
- lt's on the list.
- Good.

16:50.280 --> 16:52.189
You ought to have Sam down there.

16:52.366 --> 16:55.865
- Sam's here, right next to Ernie.
- Thank you, Norm.

16:56.036 --> 17:00.613
lt looks like my buddy's
got all the bases covered.

17:01.666 --> 17:04.785
- Where's my name?
- What?

17:04.959 --> 17:07.083
Clifford. Where's Clifford?

17:08.171 --> 17:13.079
Come on, name a kid Cliff?
Have a heart!

17:13.259 --> 17:16.673
You got every other male
name there except Zeus.

17:16.845 --> 17:20.176
Zeus? l like that, Zeus.

17:22.432 --> 17:24.260
Diane, you're back. Good.

17:24.435 --> 17:29.061
You might like to know l finally
handled that situation with Amanda,

17:29.230 --> 17:31.353
in a way you'll be proud of.

17:31.524 --> 17:34.275
- Really?
- Yeah. Oh, gotta go.

17:46.579 --> 17:51.654
l know that Sam
would not have wanted a big fuss,

17:51.833 --> 17:56.210
but shouldn't we have
some sort of funeral for him?

17:57.671 --> 18:00.374
Good Lord!

18:01.675 --> 18:05.292
Amanda, l think we'd better
straighten this out. Sam!

18:07.721 --> 18:11.802
- Sam, open the door. We have to talk.
- Has the freak show gone yet?

18:11.975 --> 18:14.761
Oh, hi.
We haven't been introduced yet.

18:14.976 --> 18:18.975
l'm Ed, Sam's twin brother.
l'm here to handle the estate.

18:19.148 --> 18:21.436
Oh, boy.

18:21.609 --> 18:24.643
Twin brother. What a trick, huh?

18:24.819 --> 18:27.488
That's why he's the boss.

18:30.032 --> 18:32.948
l can't believe you did this to me, Sam.

18:33.117 --> 18:35.241
l'm sorry, Amanda.

18:35.411 --> 18:39.574
l know it was stupid and cruel
and l could have handled it better.

18:39.749 --> 18:44.244
l guess l could have pretended
to be sick for a few days first.

18:47.421 --> 18:50.422
You don't have to apologise, Sam.

18:50.591 --> 18:54.375
l do. l put you in a terrible spot.

18:56.804 --> 18:59.046
Don't despair.

18:59.224 --> 19:03.435
Just when my life seemed
to be its darkest,

19:03.602 --> 19:08.311
l met Frasier Crane,
and learned love doesn't have to hurt.

19:08.481 --> 19:11.731
Yeah, you can sleep right through it.

19:14.820 --> 19:18.189
l made a lot of mistakes here, Sam.

19:18.364 --> 19:23.156
And l have a history
of being wrong about men.

19:23.327 --> 19:27.372
But l know it's different
this time with you.

19:27.539 --> 19:33.872
No matter what happens,
l'll never stop loving you.

19:34.045 --> 19:38.788
Till the day l die, you'll always be mine.

19:40.758 --> 19:43.842
This is going pretty well,
wouldn't you say?

19:44.011 --> 19:46.633
Amanda, l didn't want to say this.

19:46.806 --> 19:50.969
lt's something that will change
the way you feel about Sam.

19:51.685 --> 19:56.760
Nothing you could ever say will change
the way l feel about him.

19:56.939 --> 20:00.473
- Except this.
- Except nothing.

20:00.650 --> 20:07.067
No matter what you ever do,
no matter where you ever go,

20:07.240 --> 20:09.908
l'll never get over you.

20:12.661 --> 20:16.989
Amanda, do you remember the man
l used to talk about in group therapy?

20:17.165 --> 20:20.331
- Ralph?
- This is Ralph.

20:26.089 --> 20:28.461
Sam is Ralph?

20:30.468 --> 20:37.180
That's right. The man to whom you just
pledged your undying love is Ralph.

20:38.474 --> 20:40.930
He can't hold me to that.

20:41.936 --> 20:46.146
lf they won't let me sign contracts
or have a credit card or vote,

20:46.315 --> 20:51.734
then l am not responsible for hysterical
hogwash that l babbled in a bar.

20:54.697 --> 20:58.396
Thank you for saving me, Diane.

21:04.956 --> 21:08.205
Sam, l will think of you

21:08.375 --> 21:12.242
every time l see
something scurry under the sink.

21:20.219 --> 21:23.918
l don't mean to seem ungrateful,

21:24.096 --> 21:27.347
but what exactly did you say about me
in group therapy?

21:27.516 --> 21:31.678
- l told them the truth.
- For instance?

21:31.853 --> 21:34.060
l don't wanna get into this.

21:34.231 --> 21:39.817
l made a lot of mistakes myself.
l was not a perfect girlfriend.

21:39.986 --> 21:45.524
No, come on, l wanna know what lousy
things these people know about me.

21:45.699 --> 21:48.569
- l told them about Christmas.
- That again?

21:48.743 --> 21:50.949
What is wrong with giving steak knives?

21:51.120 --> 21:55.033
My mother loved them. l give them
to you and l never hear the end of it.

21:55.206 --> 22:01.041
Sam, l was your lover. You could have
given me something more personal.

22:01.212 --> 22:06.797
What did you give me for Christmas?
A scarf. What's so personal about that?

22:06.967 --> 22:10.798
l knit it myself.
And l had to take classes to learn how.

22:10.970 --> 22:15.381
l sent away for the cashmere months
before just to get that particular grade.

22:15.556 --> 22:19.221
l consulted a colourist to determine
the best colours for you

22:19.394 --> 22:23.641
and l hand-dyed the fabric myself.

22:25.733 --> 22:32.066
l would have made the steak knives
except l hocked my forge to buy the bar.

22:32.738 --> 22:34.778
What else?

22:36.616 --> 22:40.827
l told them about the time l had flu
and you didn't visit me once.

22:40.995 --> 22:45.574
And you sent me second-hand flowers
for Valentine's Day.

22:45.750 --> 22:49.616
- Well, l was nowhere near...
- You wanna hear this or not?

22:50.211 --> 22:55.251
l told them about the time l cooked you
a seven-course dinner for your birthday

22:55.424 --> 22:57.381
and you had a burger on the way over.

22:57.551 --> 23:01.215
There was an explanation.
l just can't remember what it was.

23:01.388 --> 23:04.803
And the time you lied
about a relative dying

23:04.974 --> 23:08.675
so you could go skiing
and debauching with your buddies.

23:09.603 --> 23:12.687
You still don't see the humour in that?

23:16.525 --> 23:20.771
l wanted to spend the day with you
after our first night together

23:20.945 --> 23:24.610
and you went to a football game.

23:24.782 --> 23:27.355
lt wasn't a football game.

23:27.535 --> 23:32.030
- The winners went to the play-offs.
- Oh, just forget it!

23:32.289 --> 23:34.911
l'm sorry.

23:35.082 --> 23:37.490
- What?
- l'm sorry.

23:40.713 --> 23:43.000
l did the best l could
when l was with you.

23:44.091 --> 23:48.088
You're right, l have blind spots
and l'm not a very good boyfriend,

23:48.261 --> 23:51.298
but l never tried harder
with any woman in my life.

23:51.472 --> 23:54.142
We had some bad times,

23:54.309 --> 23:57.891
but the good times with you
were some of the best of my life.

24:06.192 --> 24:09.028
That's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

24:10.196 --> 24:12.188
- Diane, l...
- No, Sam, stop.

24:12.365 --> 24:16.065
l want to get out of here before you say
something stupid that ruins it.

24:16.244 --> 24:19.861
- No, no, now stop. Don't ruin it.
- l'm not gonna ruin it.

24:25.501 --> 24:29.877
Yeah, that woulda ruined it.
Would it ever!
