00:05.570 --> 00:08.360
All these altercations in only two days...

00:08.770 --> 00:11.130
It's too many to be a coincidence.

00:11.130 --> 00:14.600
But why attack Akihabara?

00:16.650 --> 00:20.400
It seems their method is to permeate 
the city, then cause minor disturbances

00:20.400 --> 00:21.830
and spread groundless rumors.

00:22.470 --> 00:24.580
And their goal is probably

00:25.300 --> 00:27.650
to destroy the Round Table's reputation.

02:01.280 --> 02:03.010
Then I was right?

02:03.460 --> 02:05.570
Shiroe agrees, as well.

02:05.870 --> 02:07.020
An attack?

02:07.830 --> 02:10.800
The transient fifteen percent 
of the current population

02:10.800 --> 02:13.150
has caused over sixty percent of the problems.

02:13.150 --> 02:18.660
<b>Receipts                               Complaints</b>

02:13.380 --> 02:18.660
So they deliberately turned in 
faulty paperwork to confuse us?

02:19.060 --> 02:21.200
The guilds providing security are so busy

02:21.200 --> 02:25.790
dealing with a sudden outbreak of fighting 
that they can't do anything.

02:26.060 --> 02:29.040
Jeez... Who's behind this?

02:31.770 --> 02:33.890
I know it isn't nice to say,

02:33.890 --> 02:37.400
but if this were merely a banquet 
to thank the adventurers,

02:37.400 --> 02:40.140
you wouldn't have to go to all this trouble.

02:40.450 --> 02:43.310
Do not be rude, no matter what.

02:43.700 --> 02:47.230
But why is Lord Malves showing up now?

02:47.660 --> 02:51.510
Does it have anything to do with 
the revolution in the west?

02:51.810 --> 02:52.690
I don't know.

02:53.370 --> 02:57.820
Either way, he isn't someone 
we can simply turn away.

02:58.170 --> 02:59.940
Of course, I'm aware of that.

03:00.350 --> 03:01.230
But...

03:01.230 --> 03:02.070
What?

03:02.510 --> 03:04.420
I don't feel good about this.

03:05.040 --> 03:10.700
Anyway, the goal of tonight's Twilight Banquet 
is to deepen friendships with the adventurers.

03:11.030 --> 03:12.080
That's right.

03:12.590 --> 03:15.840
Naturally, I mustn't be rude to Lord Malves,

03:16.250 --> 03:19.440
but I will do my duty, and that is all.

03:19.990 --> 03:25.850
<b>Chaos</b>

03:22.420 --> 03:23.610
Chaos.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.350
And that's it.

03:28.810 --> 03:30.500
Pretty big deal, huh?

03:30.820 --> 03:32.320
Thanks.

03:32.320 --> 03:33.610
Keep at it.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.380
Was that Isaac?

03:35.730 --> 03:36.610
Yes.

03:37.090 --> 03:41.010
He said a high-ranking 
Westelandian merchant nobleman

03:41.010 --> 03:43.260
named Lord Malves has just arrived.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.000
Is that a problem?

03:46.330 --> 03:48.370
How to explain it...

03:49.890 --> 03:53.630
I believe the People of the Land 
are behind this attack.

03:53.970 --> 03:55.040
People of the Land?

03:55.040 --> 03:56.290
Why is that?

03:57.180 --> 03:59.720
In <i>Elder Tale</i>, there were no quests

03:59.720 --> 04:02.850
that involved removing someone from power.

04:03.410 --> 04:06.300
And it isn't something adventurers 
would think of, is it?

04:07.280 --> 04:10.900
It doesn't sound like a very fun quest.

04:11.560 --> 04:12.690
I understand.

04:12.690 --> 04:16.080
So, you believe this Westelandian is trying

04:16.080 --> 04:18.690
to destroy the Round Table's reputation?

04:19.530 --> 04:22.950
Given the number of People of the Land involved,

04:23.480 --> 04:26.950
the odds are high that someone 
important is running things.

04:27.660 --> 04:29.450
That's what I'd thought,

04:30.230 --> 04:32.730
and it appears I wasn't too far off.

04:32.730 --> 04:35.960
Then the attack is from the west?

04:36.590 --> 04:38.460
Don't tell anyone for a while.

04:38.460 --> 04:42.840
But why would he want to destroy 
the Round Table's reputation?

04:43.220 --> 04:44.980
It's only one step in the plan.

04:45.480 --> 04:47.180
Most likely, he's trying

04:47.800 --> 04:52.490
to take advantage of the confusion so he can 
interfere with the Eastal-Round Table treaty.

04:54.160 --> 04:57.060
So that Eastal can't monopolize the benefits of it.

04:57.240 --> 04:59.120
We need to act quickly.

04:59.120 --> 05:02.060
We may have to cancel the festival.

05:02.060 --> 05:03.750
That's not a wise idea.

05:05.410 --> 05:06.910
If we cancel the festival,

05:06.910 --> 05:09.470
it calls into question our problem-solving ability.

05:10.270 --> 05:12.520
That's exactly what he wants.

05:13.070 --> 05:17.290
The best choice is probably to minimize 
the damage and wait things out.

05:17.970 --> 05:19.690
Then, how do we react?

05:20.010 --> 05:24.410
Well, I'm sure they've at least anticipated 
the possibility of a counterattack...

05:25.740 --> 05:27.760
So we'll give them one.

05:29.080 --> 05:31.340
Uh... Put those away.

05:31.810 --> 05:32.770
But my lord,

05:33.500 --> 05:34.770
we're going to fight, right?

05:34.770 --> 05:39.100
No, I didn't mean we'd start 
any kind of bloodshed.

05:39.580 --> 05:41.460
This time, we won't need those.

05:45.950 --> 05:47.030
Report to you?

05:47.030 --> 05:47.780
Yes.

05:48.080 --> 05:53.290
Just keep me constantly informed about 
what problems come up and where.

05:53.290 --> 05:54.780
Leave it to me.

05:54.780 --> 05:55.790
Wait...

05:56.150 --> 05:58.540
Aren't Isaac and his buddies on this?

05:59.380 --> 06:01.890
We have more ground to cover than expected.

06:02.460 --> 06:04.110
And if I want to set up

06:04.110 --> 06:07.610
new chains of command and bring 
in more personnel efficiently,

06:07.610 --> 06:09.550
I need more information.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.700
Can you ask the other guilds for help?

06:12.060 --> 06:15.210
If they knew the Round Table was 
worked up enough to take action,

06:15.210 --> 06:17.550
it'd give the enemy what they want.

06:18.020 --> 06:20.330
So we need to ask for help 
from whoever's available,

06:20.330 --> 06:22.900
as long as it isn't enough for them to notice.

06:23.250 --> 06:25.320
Right, strategist?

06:25.770 --> 06:27.230
Yes, thanks.

06:27.580 --> 06:28.780
And that's the situation.

06:28.780 --> 06:30.250
Keep us informed.

06:31.260 --> 06:33.000
Okay, I'm on my way.

06:33.000 --> 06:33.830
Okay.

06:34.640 --> 06:37.830
Sorry your brother had to help, too.

06:38.170 --> 06:40.830
No, Shiroe gave him the order.

06:38.410 --> 06:40.530
Claim checks, claim checks...

06:41.020 --> 06:42.160
Did he?

06:42.160 --> 06:43.890
To help us?

06:43.890 --> 06:47.070
No, not exactly...

06:47.930 --> 06:51.080
Yeah, it might be better if 
you met up with Tohya.

06:51.080 --> 06:52.350
That's about it, I think.

06:53.340 --> 06:55.470
Um, is that all?

06:55.980 --> 06:59.480
If it's true that we're under attack,

06:59.760 --> 07:01.570
then isn't there anything I can...

07:01.570 --> 07:02.280
That's it.

07:02.280 --> 07:02.980
Thanks.

07:06.220 --> 07:10.490
<i>I think Shiroe was telling me 
to do whatever I think is best.</i>

07:11.020 --> 07:14.490
<i>He wants me to make my own 
decisions about how to help.</i>

07:14.940 --> 07:16.050
Hey, there.

07:16.050 --> 07:19.000
About the refund for those 
double-charged potatoes...

07:16.490 --> 07:19.000
<b>Urgent</b>

07:19.530 --> 07:21.220
These, too.

07:21.220 --> 07:22.000
On it.

07:22.700 --> 07:25.670
<i>I may be wrong, but...</i>

07:26.550 --> 07:28.140
<i>If that's true...</i>

07:28.580 --> 07:32.270
<i>If he's counting on me, even a little...</i>

07:33.020 --> 07:34.200
<i>I'm...</i>

07:36.040 --> 07:38.270
Minori, I'm sorry, but I also have these.

07:38.640 --> 07:41.540
Are these all claim checks for luggage?

07:41.540 --> 07:42.270
Yeah...

07:42.550 --> 07:44.730
We just keep getting more and more work.

07:44.730 --> 07:46.400
The real show's just about to start...

07:47.340 --> 07:50.330
All right. I'll defend our 
rear line to the death.

07:51.820 --> 07:54.910
<i>Shiroe taught me how to fight.</i>

07:55.410 --> 08:00.570
<i>Formation, operator, field monitor, patrol file.</i>

08:01.420 --> 08:03.580
<i>What's the first thing the front line should do?</i>

08:04.200 --> 08:05.430
<i>What about the healer?</i>

08:06.280 --> 08:07.380
<i>What about the rear line?</i>

08:09.230 --> 08:12.000
Um... This is it, right?

08:12.990 --> 08:14.890
I'm with the council.

08:14.890 --> 08:17.220
I've come to pick up the claim checks.

08:17.560 --> 08:19.660
We're customers, you know!

08:17.810 --> 08:21.060
This is bad... Seriously, it's a battlefield.

08:19.660 --> 08:21.060
How long do we have to wait?

08:21.960 --> 08:26.290
<i>Those at the warehouse desk, 
fielding a slew of complaints...</i>

08:22.310 --> 08:23.920
One at a time!

08:23.920 --> 08:25.780
This is a food service business!

08:25.780 --> 08:26.780
Stay in line!

08:27.010 --> 08:29.050
<i>They're the front line.</i>

08:29.730 --> 08:30.570
Right.

08:30.870 --> 08:32.940
The basement of warehouse 3.

08:33.530 --> 08:34.580
Really?

08:34.580 --> 08:36.000
Okay, thanks.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.580
I'll send you the vouchers.

08:38.050 --> 08:41.620
<i>And Karashin and his friends are healers, 
dealing with the problems</i>

08:38.050 --> 08:41.620
Oh, also, sorry to ask you for more, but...

08:41.620 --> 08:43.580
<i>the others can't handle.</i>

08:44.310 --> 08:48.140
<i>As the rear line, I need to support 
them all as much as I can.</i>

08:50.110 --> 08:50.910
Sorry.

08:50.910 --> 08:53.470
Don't "sorry" me! Those took forever to organize!

08:53.470 --> 08:54.430
What's with you?

08:54.430 --> 08:55.360
What's with <i>you</i>?!

08:55.360 --> 08:56.840
Now, now, now...

08:56.840 --> 08:57.810
It's all right.

08:58.350 --> 09:01.350
<b>Complaints</b>

08:58.940 --> 09:00.940
Accidents aren't scary.

09:01.640 --> 09:03.650
What's scary is getting angry.

09:03.650 --> 09:05.570
What's scary is stopping the flow.

09:05.570 --> 09:06.350
The flow?

09:07.640 --> 09:10.610
I'm sorry, it's something Shiroe told me.

09:11.720 --> 09:14.110
The flow of battle isn't something you read.

09:14.380 --> 09:15.820
You must become the flow.

09:16.270 --> 09:17.620
I see...

09:17.890 --> 09:19.330
That's reassuring.

09:19.330 --> 09:22.020
It's like Shiroe himself is here.

09:23.200 --> 09:24.040
Not at all...

09:25.640 --> 09:27.160
Okay, let's keep at it.

09:27.160 --> 09:28.430
Let's become the flow!

09:28.430 --> 09:29.130
Yeah!

09:29.560 --> 09:34.490
<i>I've learned so much, and gained 
so much, from Shiroe.</i>

09:35.290 --> 09:37.640
<i>But someday,</i>

09:38.090 --> 09:41.300
<i>I want to be able to give something to him.</i>

09:42.000 --> 09:42.800
What?

09:43.530 --> 09:46.700
"This pot is a good pot"? I don't get it.

09:44.970 --> 09:47.600
Yes, the west side of the Cathedral.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.650
<i>What is this?</i>

09:47.580 --> 09:51.380
<i>They're repeatedly attacking areas 
that have no strategic value...</i>

09:52.040 --> 09:53.630
<i>What's going on?</i>

09:53.630 --> 09:54.890
Shiroe?

09:54.890 --> 09:57.810
Another carriage has thrown a 
wheel, and is blocking a road.

09:57.810 --> 09:58.660
I heard you.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.450
The west side of the Cathedral?

10:02.740 --> 10:04.340
That doesn't make sense, either...

10:06.440 --> 10:10.340
Even if they close this path, 
there are plenty of ways around.

10:10.340 --> 10:12.300
If they wanted to stop traffic...

10:12.300 --> 10:14.260
There isn't any real point to it.

10:14.940 --> 10:16.680
<i>There's something more to this.</i>

10:16.680 --> 10:19.030
<i>That's the obvious conclusion, but...</i>

10:19.610 --> 10:22.680
So, see, the Round Table is

10:22.680 --> 10:26.180
illegally making off with 
most of the festival profits.

10:28.120 --> 10:30.770
What were you saying about our Round Table?

10:30.770 --> 10:31.910
Nothing...

10:33.330 --> 10:34.440
I see...

10:35.090 --> 10:38.350
Seems they're definitely after the Round Table.

10:38.350 --> 10:39.950
What will you do, villain?

10:41.500 --> 10:43.950
Things are quite confused here, as well.

10:44.360 --> 10:48.800
Clearly, we don't have the right 
number of personnel here.

10:48.800 --> 10:49.910
Really?

10:49.910 --> 10:52.040
I expected things to be a mess there,

10:52.040 --> 10:54.710
so I sent a pretty fair number.

10:54.990 --> 10:58.940
It's taking too long to resolve 
each individual incident.

10:59.500 --> 11:03.050
In some cases, several people are being tied up

11:03.050 --> 11:09.340
by a single People of the Land 
merchant for an entire hour.

11:10.260 --> 11:15.490
And there are many problems that 
they aren't suited to solving.

11:15.920 --> 11:17.540
I apologized, didn't I?

11:17.540 --> 11:19.100
You call that an apology?

11:19.100 --> 11:20.230
Oh...

11:20.670 --> 11:22.450
Domestic quarrels, huh?

11:22.450 --> 11:26.050
With all of these couples around, 
I expected some.

11:26.050 --> 11:27.990
But there are far too many.

11:27.990 --> 11:30.750
And this isn't something that, well...

11:31.360 --> 11:34.790
That adventurers are really 
good at handling, right?

11:35.170 --> 11:36.250
True.

11:36.540 --> 11:38.620
But what do you think?

11:38.620 --> 11:41.020
Is that part of the attack?

11:41.020 --> 11:41.750
Meow?

11:42.330 --> 11:45.150
That's rare for you, Shiroe.

11:45.150 --> 11:47.430
You seem uncertain.

11:47.740 --> 11:48.500
Yeah.

11:49.040 --> 11:51.270
Anything you don't know,

11:51.530 --> 11:54.020
I'm not going to know...

11:54.710 --> 12:00.530
But I don't see any unified 
purpose to their actions.

12:01.960 --> 12:02.960
<i>Why?</i>

12:03.290 --> 12:06.530
<i>The more I think, the less clearly 
I can visualize the enemy.</i>

12:07.450 --> 12:10.910
<i>Find it. There has to be some rule to this.</i>

12:11.710 --> 12:12.730
<i>Find it...</i>

12:12.730 --> 12:15.500
<i>There must be some intent 
behind this randomness.</i>

12:16.370 --> 12:17.250
<i>Shutting down traffic,</i>

12:17.730 --> 12:19.630
<i>spreading rumors and starting quarrels,</i>

12:19.630 --> 12:21.610
<i>deliberately submitting bad paperwork,</i>

12:21.610 --> 12:23.360
<i>minor tax fraud,</i>

12:23.360 --> 12:24.880
<i>trying to bribe us,</i>

12:24.880 --> 12:28.890
<i>tying up staff with complaints about everything...</i>

12:29.570 --> 12:31.120
<i>A multi-layered attack?</i>

12:31.120 --> 12:33.030
<i>Or making it up as they go?</i>

12:33.370 --> 12:34.400
<i>No way.</i>

12:34.400 --> 12:36.090
<i>What are they thinking?</i>

12:36.090 --> 12:37.190
Shiroe!

12:37.600 --> 12:40.570
The Marine Agency received a large 
number of pizzas they didn't order!

12:41.050 --> 12:42.020
My lord!

12:42.020 --> 12:46.070
The cockroaches at Eat-'Til-You-Drop Alley 
were actually made of rubber!

12:46.510 --> 12:48.520
Pizza? Cockroaches?

12:50.190 --> 12:51.270
That's just stupid...

12:51.640 --> 12:52.830
Shiroe?

12:53.850 --> 12:55.250
<i>That's just too stupid.</i>

12:55.950 --> 12:58.090
<i>They don't have anything in mind.</i>

12:58.560 --> 13:01.590
<i>They're not thinking about anything at all.</i>

13:02.350 --> 13:05.150
<i>Each of their attacks is improvised.</i>

13:05.150 --> 13:07.100
<i>Everything's invented on the spot...</i>

13:07.810 --> 13:11.680
<i>No matter how much we stress 
over this, it's pointless!</i>

13:12.110 --> 13:13.600
<i>Enemies like these...</i>

13:14.490 --> 13:16.290
Enemies like these...

13:17.360 --> 13:21.500
are the kind I hate!

13:27.720 --> 13:30.160
<i>I can't do anything if I'm like this.</i>

13:30.650 --> 13:33.350
<i>But if I don't do something within an hour,</i>

13:33.350 --> 13:35.370
<i>people will notice something's up.</i>

13:36.100 --> 13:39.490
<i>How can I fight an enemy that's this random?</i>

13:40.410 --> 13:42.800
Hey, if it isn't Shiro.

13:43.320 --> 13:45.240
You've been working hard!

13:43.320 --> 13:45.240
Long time, no see!

13:45.240 --> 13:46.130
Hi.

13:46.470 --> 13:50.360
Oh, the cake buffet was really nice to us.

13:50.360 --> 13:51.640
Yeah!

13:52.630 --> 13:53.700
Nice to you?

13:54.060 --> 13:55.640
They gave me a ton of whole cakes,

13:56.030 --> 13:59.890
and it was too much for me, 
so I called the other members...

14:01.280 --> 14:03.150
Soujirou!

14:03.690 --> 14:05.310
And each time more members came,

14:05.310 --> 14:07.560
they were kind enough to bring us more.

14:07.560 --> 14:10.160
I don't know if I'd call that "kindness"...

14:10.430 --> 14:11.940
We ate them all.

14:11.940 --> 14:13.130
Give us some more.

14:13.130 --> 14:14.730
A strawberry tart, too.

14:14.730 --> 14:16.530
You want some more, Sou?

14:17.390 --> 14:20.270
By the time we'd had thirty or so, 
she said she was out of cakes.

14:20.640 --> 14:21.460
What?!

14:21.460 --> 14:22.310
What?

14:23.700 --> 14:26.590
<i>He just kept bringing more people 
until they ran out of cake?</i>

14:27.050 --> 14:30.760
<i>He fought a bunch of cakes by 
bringing in a bunch of girls?</i>

14:31.370 --> 14:33.960
The orange mousse was really good...

14:33.960 --> 14:35.770
Like a lingering scent of summer.

14:35.770 --> 14:37.410
Yeah!

14:37.410 --> 14:38.770
<i>But...</i>

14:39.310 --> 14:42.620
<i>That might have been the best counter 
to the cake girl's careful plans.</i>

14:43.000 --> 14:47.200
<i>And since he had no idea what he was 
doing, he was invincible in a way.</i>

14:47.730 --> 14:48.460
Wait.

14:49.020 --> 14:51.410
No... You came at the perfect time!

14:52.490 --> 14:53.660
Shiro?

14:55.250 --> 14:56.820
I have the perfect job for you.

14:57.220 --> 14:58.540
I need your help.

15:01.510 --> 15:02.600
I've got someone...

15:02.600 --> 15:04.170
I've got someone right here.

15:04.670 --> 15:07.670
A bundle of obliviousness that 
can beat their randomness!

15:08.870 --> 15:10.080
Scary.

15:14.060 --> 15:18.180
Thanks to all of you, 
Maihama and Eastal were saved.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.110
I cannot express my gratitude.

15:21.520 --> 15:25.760
N-No, no... As adventurers, that's our job!

15:25.760 --> 15:27.790
And we got paid...

15:27.790 --> 15:30.200
It was nothing, really.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.860
They're all blushing like children.

15:32.860 --> 15:37.910
But it's much better than being flattered 
or fawned over for no reason.

15:39.750 --> 15:44.880
Princess, Lord Malves will be arriving soon.

15:44.880 --> 15:45.710
Oh...

15:46.100 --> 15:51.500
He's arrived with a ship carrying 
a large amount of cargo, but...

15:52.050 --> 15:53.600
Is there a problem?

15:53.880 --> 15:56.030
This was all so sudden,

15:56.030 --> 15:59.640
and there's so much, it should have 
been dealt with in advance...

16:00.980 --> 16:02.380
Who's that?

16:02.380 --> 16:04.150
A People of the Land nobleman?

16:04.350 --> 16:07.240
Look, he has adventurers guarding him.

16:04.610 --> 16:10.610
<b>Daimonji /Adventurer        Malves /Person of the Land 
Arumi /Adventurer             Eijirou /Adventurer</b>

16:07.240 --> 16:09.190
Is it a quest or something?

16:09.190 --> 16:10.610
Does that mean he's important?

16:11.720 --> 16:14.620
Oh, how beautiful...

16:14.870 --> 16:19.620
If I remember correctly, you're the Cowen girl.

16:19.620 --> 16:21.960
Princess Lenessia, wasn't it?

16:21.960 --> 16:25.430
Thank you for coming to my banquet, 
as we celebrate the fall festival...

16:26.980 --> 16:30.070
I'm happy to see that it is so successful!

16:30.070 --> 16:33.630
But there seems to be quite a lack of order.

16:34.580 --> 16:37.790
Nobles attending the same 
banquet as commoners.

16:38.630 --> 16:41.580
Is this boldness unique to eastern people,

16:41.580 --> 16:44.270
who bear the merchant god's blood in their veins?

16:45.150 --> 16:48.110
Come on, let's have a toast, old dude!

16:49.910 --> 16:51.240
What was that for?!

16:51.240 --> 16:52.890
Stay back, filthy thing.

16:53.420 --> 16:54.360
Princess...

16:57.640 --> 16:58.870
I'm very sorry.

16:59.510 --> 17:00.640
Come this way.

17:00.640 --> 17:02.370
Oh, it's fine.

17:02.370 --> 17:03.700
It didn't hurt or anything.

17:03.700 --> 17:04.670
Sorry about that.

17:04.670 --> 17:07.130
I apologize for his breach of etiquette.

17:08.110 --> 17:12.800
I don't know if it will be to your liking, 
but would you care for some eastern sake?

17:22.240 --> 17:24.020
You wanna fight here?

17:24.460 --> 17:27.520
You're ready for what that means, right?

17:27.760 --> 17:29.390
Now then, Princess...

17:29.390 --> 17:32.700
I'd like you to prepare a warehouse at once.

17:32.700 --> 17:36.670
We cannot allow our seafood to lose its freshness.

17:36.670 --> 17:39.870
Yes, I'll speak to someone immediately.

17:39.870 --> 17:40.500
Please give me a—

17:40.500 --> 17:42.500
Huh?! Speak to someone?

17:42.500 --> 17:44.520
What are you talking about?

17:44.520 --> 17:46.760
I've sent the appropriate paperwork.

17:46.760 --> 17:50.280
I sent an identical message to 
Lord Sergiatte of Maihama,

17:50.280 --> 17:52.820
and received an answer.

17:54.370 --> 17:57.050
I'm sure you're prepared to receive them.

17:57.400 --> 18:00.120
These are the finest quality goods,

18:00.120 --> 18:02.810
normally reserved for the imperial princesses.

18:03.060 --> 18:05.760
I can't have them treated roughly.

18:05.760 --> 18:07.560
Do you understand?

18:07.560 --> 18:13.070
<b>Silver Hall 

Task Force</b>

18:07.880 --> 18:10.230
Okay, line up.

18:10.230 --> 18:13.070
You, there... No cutting in line.

18:13.400 --> 18:16.320
What's wrong? We can take your paperwork here.

18:16.870 --> 18:19.000
<i>This is working better than I expected.</i>

18:19.000 --> 18:20.330
Strategist...

18:20.710 --> 18:22.150
Strategist Shiroe.

18:22.150 --> 18:23.750
You mean me?

18:24.470 --> 18:27.030
I've got five more.

18:27.030 --> 18:29.760
They're ready to form a platoon and head out.

18:30.790 --> 18:31.750
Where's Soujirou?

18:32.050 --> 18:32.900
Yes, sir!

18:32.900 --> 18:37.530
Sou is presently on a date... 
I mean, patrolling the hall!

18:37.530 --> 18:40.260
Platoon four is with him!

18:40.500 --> 18:42.640
Then contact Soujirou.

18:43.450 --> 18:45.920
Platoon four is to switch with platoon five,

18:46.240 --> 18:48.480
and continue to patrol the hall.

18:48.900 --> 18:50.270
Roger.

18:50.270 --> 18:54.900
We, in platoon five, will go 
out on patrol with Sou!

18:56.170 --> 18:57.480
We're going with Sou!

18:57.480 --> 18:59.050
Now I see.

18:59.050 --> 19:02.970
A group date, under the auspices of patrolling.

19:02.970 --> 19:04.910
Yeah, pretty much.

19:06.070 --> 19:11.030
<i>Over twenty platoons of Soujirou 
fangirls are patrolling Akihabara.</i>

19:12.670 --> 19:15.540
<i>Those girls are tied by bonds of sisterhood,</i>

19:15.540 --> 19:19.160
<i>and use their chain of command 
to organically form groups,</i>

19:19.920 --> 19:22.770
<i>dealing with trouble in a 
flexible and honest manner,</i>

19:22.770 --> 19:24.680
<i>and stopping problems before they start.</i>

19:25.990 --> 19:30.360
At Strategist Shiroe's orders, 
we're here to switch with you!

19:30.360 --> 19:31.830
Right...

19:32.300 --> 19:35.770
And their motivation is that,

19:35.770 --> 19:38.750
if they participate, they have 
a chance to get closer to Soujirou.

19:39.140 --> 19:40.650
That's it?

19:41.050 --> 19:44.200
The plan is a huge success.

19:44.580 --> 19:50.410
Well, to be honest, even I wasn't 
sure a plan like that would work...

19:51.110 --> 19:53.430
All we can do against this harassment

19:53.430 --> 19:57.490
is send out as many people 
as we can get to fight it.

19:57.890 --> 20:00.150
Their chain of command is solid,

20:00.150 --> 20:03.110
and they're dealing with problems 
in an efficient manner.

20:04.520 --> 20:11.230
And it's tough to cause trouble when 
you're surrounded by young girls.

20:11.570 --> 20:13.570
And since romance is all they think about,

20:13.570 --> 20:17.230
they can be trusted to handle 
the relationship problems, as well.

20:17.770 --> 20:20.240
This really is the perfect job for them.

20:20.630 --> 20:23.080
My hat's off to Soujirou.

20:23.080 --> 20:25.240
Feel free to compliment him more.

20:25.240 --> 20:27.620
Why are you sighing, my lord?

20:27.620 --> 20:28.560
Well...

20:29.080 --> 20:30.250
Are you jealous?

20:30.690 --> 20:32.250
Not at all...

20:32.720 --> 20:35.750
Not jealous, just irritated.

20:36.030 --> 20:38.330
Well, something like that.

20:38.820 --> 20:41.150
I understand how he feels.

20:44.290 --> 20:48.200
Strategist, a message from security 
at the Watermaple Mansion.

20:48.560 --> 20:49.630
Thanks.

20:49.630 --> 20:52.250
That's where the banquet's being held, right?

20:52.250 --> 20:53.520
Did something happen?

20:54.210 --> 20:55.480
I had them look into

20:56.130 --> 20:58.620
a big-shot from the west who's 
shown up in Akihabara.

20:58.960 --> 21:01.030
If he's behind this...

21:01.280 --> 21:05.030
He'll be after the other party 
he's negotiating with.

21:05.250 --> 21:09.290
The princess who moved here from Maihama.

21:09.890 --> 21:12.660
Chief, you're in charge here for a while.

21:12.660 --> 21:13.790
Roger that.

21:14.080 --> 21:16.580
My lord, what about the stage?

21:16.580 --> 21:18.800
I have a plan for that, too.

21:19.770 --> 21:23.400
If their goal is to tear the 
Akihabara people apart,

21:24.120 --> 21:26.720
we just need to make the 
Scale Festival more fun,

21:26.720 --> 21:29.100
and ensure participants have 
as much fun as possible.

21:30.510 --> 21:33.810
As long as we're doing this, 
let's set off some big fireworks.

21:37.090 --> 21:38.140
Well?

21:38.140 --> 21:40.130
The documents are real...

21:40.130 --> 21:41.820
It's hard to imagine,

21:42.260 --> 21:45.020
but all I can think is that we 
messed up, and missed them.

21:45.420 --> 21:46.570
We couldn't have...

21:47.940 --> 21:50.440
Are you telling me you weren't prepared?

21:50.440 --> 21:53.120
Even though I asked so long ago?

21:53.120 --> 21:56.870
Is that how the Cowen family operates?

21:57.660 --> 22:07.290
Or was it untrue that you'd established 
favorable relations with Akihabara?

22:07.760 --> 22:11.060
<i>I just need to apologize, 
and settle this peacefully.</i>

22:12.350 --> 22:15.990
<i>If only I could postpone this 
until after the banquet...</i>

22:16.850 --> 22:18.060
Good evening!

22:19.770 --> 22:21.250
He's with the Round Table.

22:21.250 --> 22:22.210
The guy in glasses...

22:22.210 --> 22:23.490
Hi, there...

22:24.020 --> 22:25.490
Shiroe?

22:27.140 --> 22:29.280
I've come to get you, Princess.

22:30.420 --> 22:32.240
Who are you?

22:33.290 --> 22:34.460
Hello.

24:05.380 --> 24:07.780
It seemed the end was near,

24:07.780 --> 24:10.770
but in fact, it was only the beginning.

24:11.120 --> 24:13.540
The true threat appears before Shiroe.

24:13.540 --> 24:15.830
The coal-black queen,

24:15.830 --> 24:18.180
a white flower blooming in the darkness.

24:18.540 --> 24:20.520
Their encounter will change history,

24:20.520 --> 24:22.650
and open the curtain on a new story.

24:22.650 --> 24:29.990
<b>The Scale Festival</b>

24:22.890 --> 24:24.400
Next time: The Scale Festival.

24:24.920 --> 24:26.790
We will change the world.
