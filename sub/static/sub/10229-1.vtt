00:32.889 --> 00:35.307
<i>The world is full of complainers.</i>

00:36.893 --> 00:40.146
<i>The fact is,
nothing comes with a guarantee.</i>

00:41.648 --> 00:44.567
<i>And I don't care
if you're the Pope of Rome,</i>

00:44.651 --> 00:48.404
<i>President of the United States,
or Man of the Year.</i>

00:48.780 --> 00:51.031
<i>Something can all go wrong.</i>

00:51.741 --> 00:55.786
<i>Go on ahead, you know, complain,
tell your problems to your neighbor,</i>

00:55.871 --> 00:58.539
<i>ask for help and watch him fly.</i>

01:00.750 --> 01:03.294
<i>Now, in Russia, they got it mapped out</i>

01:03.378 --> 01:06.046
<i>so that everyone pulls for everyone else.</i>

01:07.048 --> 01:09.091
<i>That's the theory, anyway.</i>

01:10.468 --> 01:13.012
<i>But what I know about is Texas.</i>

01:13.763 --> 01:17.099
<i>And down here, you're on your own.</i>

01:28.278 --> 01:32.072
Gave me a little pearl-handled .38
for our first anniversary.

01:32.365 --> 01:33.365
Uh-huh.

01:35.243 --> 01:37.828
Figure I better leave
before I use it on him.

01:42.792 --> 01:45.336
I just don't know how you can stand him.

01:45.629 --> 01:46.837
I'm only an employee.

01:46.922 --> 01:48.214
I ain't married to him.

01:48.465 --> 01:49.590
Yeah.

01:53.303 --> 01:54.678
It's just...

01:55.805 --> 01:57.306
I don't know.

01:59.017 --> 02:01.852
Sometimes I think maybe
there's something wrong with him,

02:02.270 --> 02:05.522
like maybe he's sick, mentally.

02:08.276 --> 02:10.568
Or is it maybe me, do you think?

02:11.738 --> 02:13.197
Listen, I...

02:14.157 --> 02:16.492
I ain't a marriage counselor.

02:16.826 --> 02:18.994
I don't know what goes on.

02:21.498 --> 02:23.207
I don't wanna know.

02:25.794 --> 02:27.336
But I like you.

02:29.631 --> 02:31.340
I always liked you.

02:39.683 --> 02:42.142
What are you gonna do in Houston?

02:43.395 --> 02:45.688
Oh, I'll figure something out.

02:47.065 --> 02:50.067
How come you offered
to drive me in this mess?

02:51.736 --> 02:53.654
I told you, I like you.

02:57.158 --> 02:58.826
I never knew that.

03:00.620 --> 03:02.246
Well, now you do.

03:06.835 --> 03:07.835
Hell.

03:12.507 --> 03:14.383
Stop the car, Ray!

03:49.085 --> 03:50.753
You know that car?

03:52.922 --> 03:53.964
No.

03:57.260 --> 03:58.927
What's the matter?

03:59.721 --> 04:01.180
I don't know.

04:04.017 --> 04:06.769
I just think maybe I'm making a mistake.

04:10.940 --> 04:12.983
What was that back there?

04:13.818 --> 04:15.194
Back where?

04:16.154 --> 04:17.488
That sign.

04:19.616 --> 04:21.075
I don't know.

04:22.577 --> 04:23.786
Motel.

04:25.747 --> 04:26.997
- Abby...
- Ray.

04:28.792 --> 04:31.043
Do you remember what you said before?

04:31.753 --> 04:33.962
Were you just being a gentleman?

04:34.130 --> 04:35.881
Abby, I like you.

04:39.302 --> 04:42.012
But it's no point starting anything now.

04:42.639 --> 04:43.764
Yeah.

04:45.350 --> 04:47.643
- I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor.
- Yeah.

04:54.692 --> 04:56.485
What do you wanna do?

04:58.196 --> 04:59.738
What do you wanna do?

05:34.107 --> 05:35.190
Hello.

05:35.275 --> 05:37.151
<i>Having a good time?</i>

05:39.154 --> 05:40.279
Who is this?

05:40.363 --> 05:41.822
<i>I don't know. Who's this?</i>

05:47.787 --> 05:49.371
<i>You still there?</i>

05:49.539 --> 05:50.956
Yeah, I'm still here.

06:05.930 --> 06:07.014
Ray?

06:08.224 --> 06:09.308
Yeah.

06:10.393 --> 06:11.768
Who was it?

06:15.064 --> 06:16.565
Your husband.

06:30.163 --> 06:31.997
<i>Put your sweet lips</i>

06:32.582 --> 06:38.504
<i>A little closer to the phone</i>

06:40.423 --> 06:46.053
<i>And let's pretend that we're together...</i>

06:59.526 --> 07:02.027
I know where you can get those framed.

07:04.197 --> 07:05.989
Why'd you take these?

07:06.616 --> 07:09.618
What do you mean? Just doing my job.

07:10.495 --> 07:13.705
You called me. I knew they were there.
Why'd you take them?

07:13.790 --> 07:15.791
Well, I don't know.

07:16.334 --> 07:18.335
Call it a fringe benefit.

07:20.004 --> 07:22.005
How long you watch them?

07:24.133 --> 07:25.300
Most the night.

07:26.719 --> 07:31.056
They'd rest every few minutes,
then they'd get started again.

07:32.475 --> 07:33.475
Hmm.

07:39.190 --> 07:40.816
Quite something.

07:41.442 --> 07:42.442
Hmm.

07:46.406 --> 07:48.865
You know, in Greece,

07:52.245 --> 07:56.164
they would cut off the head of the messenger
that brought the bad news.

08:03.298 --> 08:05.382
Now that don't make much sense.

08:06.175 --> 08:07.175
No.

08:09.095 --> 08:10.971
Made them feel better.

08:12.348 --> 08:15.851
Well, first off, Julian,

08:16.728 --> 08:19.563
I don't know what the story is in Greece,

08:20.148 --> 08:23.817
but in this state we got
very definite laws about that.

08:25.403 --> 08:27.529
Second, I'm not a messenger.

08:28.573 --> 08:30.699
I'm a private investigator.

08:31.659 --> 08:36.621
And third and most important,
it ain't such bad news.

08:37.164 --> 08:40.125
I mean, you thought he was colored.

08:41.669 --> 08:44.046
You're always assuming the worst.

08:45.048 --> 08:46.548
Anything else?

08:46.633 --> 08:47.883
Mmm-hmm.

08:48.509 --> 08:50.636
Don't come around here anymore.

08:50.720 --> 08:53.847
If I need you,
I'll know what rock to turn over.

09:01.481 --> 09:03.106
That's good, yeah.

09:03.191 --> 09:04.191
Yeah.

09:04.525 --> 09:08.820
"What rock to turn over."
That's very, very good.

09:14.160 --> 09:17.704
You give me a call whenever
you want to cut off my head.

09:21.084 --> 09:23.710
I can always crawl around without it.

09:43.439 --> 09:45.357
<i>Jeannie and the boys...</i>

09:49.445 --> 09:50.862
<i>They'll be back after a spell.</i>

09:50.947 --> 09:52.614
<i>Hopefully you will be, too.</i>

09:53.741 --> 09:55.617
<i>Darn right.</i>

10:05.962 --> 10:07.629
Hold it, hold it.

10:19.058 --> 10:22.519
<i>You're sweet as a honey bee</i>

10:22.645 --> 10:24.604
<i>But like a honey bee stings...</i>

10:24.689 --> 10:26.231
Where was I?

10:26.774 --> 10:28.900
You were telling me
about the Ring of Fire.

10:28.985 --> 10:31.111
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Right. Right, right.

10:31.195 --> 10:33.947
Now, look, you've got
all these volcanoes, right?

10:34.031 --> 10:37.868
And every time one goes pop,
you got the equivalent of what,

10:37.952 --> 10:39.661
20, 30 megatons of TNT.

10:39.746 --> 10:41.329
Meurice.

10:42.248 --> 10:44.750
Yeah, I know, Marty. Pour them short.

10:46.127 --> 10:47.335
Did Ray come in yet?

10:47.420 --> 10:48.754
No, it's his night off.

10:48.838 --> 10:50.130
Where was he last night?

10:50.214 --> 10:52.466
How do I know where he was last night?

10:52.884 --> 10:55.093
I don't know. Didn't he call?

10:58.014 --> 11:01.850
Marty, this is an old friend of mine.
This is Debra.

11:02.351 --> 11:04.519
Debra, this is Julian Marty.

11:05.730 --> 11:08.190
There's a deuce in the corner needs help.

11:08.399 --> 11:09.608
Right.

11:12.695 --> 11:14.696
How long you know Meurice?

11:16.032 --> 11:17.115
About ten years.

11:17.200 --> 11:18.366
Ten years, huh?

11:19.327 --> 11:20.911
What are you doing tonight?

11:21.871 --> 11:23.789
Going out with Meurice.

11:27.585 --> 11:29.795
Tell him you have a headache.

11:31.047 --> 11:32.214
It'll pass.

11:35.051 --> 11:37.594
We don't seem to be communicating...

11:37.678 --> 11:39.721
Look, you wanna hustle me.

11:40.264 --> 11:41.431
I don't wanna be hustled.

11:41.516 --> 11:42.516
Oh, you don't?

11:42.600 --> 11:43.975
It's as simple as that.

11:44.060 --> 11:45.310
Oh, it's as simple as that.

11:45.394 --> 11:46.645
Meurice,

11:47.855 --> 11:49.147
I'm not here if Ray calls, okay?

11:49.232 --> 11:50.273
Right.

11:50.358 --> 11:51.358
Right.

11:54.153 --> 11:55.320
Nice guy.

11:55.404 --> 11:56.780
Not really.

11:58.074 --> 11:59.574
What did you say your last name was?

12:44.370 --> 12:45.912
There, Opal.

13:31.709 --> 13:32.792
<i>Ray?</i>

13:37.298 --> 13:38.340
Yeah.

13:38.424 --> 13:39.799
<i>Let's get out of here.</i>

13:40.676 --> 13:42.260
You get what you wanted?

13:42.345 --> 13:43.929
<i>Yeah. Let's get out of here.</i>

13:45.848 --> 13:47.182
Drive me to a motel?

13:47.266 --> 13:48.767
You can stay at my place.

13:50.186 --> 13:51.436
Drop you there.

13:51.520 --> 13:52.771
Where are you going?

13:52.855 --> 13:54.189
See a guy.

13:54.523 --> 13:56.691
Ray, don't go to the bar.

13:57.401 --> 13:59.861
I know him. It ain't a good idea.

14:01.155 --> 14:02.572
I just gotta see a guy.

14:08.287 --> 14:14.125
<i>Sweet dreams of you</i>

14:14.210 --> 14:15.961
So it's a deal.

14:16.045 --> 14:19.631
You and your colleagues find a way
to harness this vast, volcanic energy,

14:19.715 --> 14:23.134
and I'll just sit back and watch
these shitkickers go broke.

14:23.219 --> 14:24.219
Howdy, stranger.

14:24.303 --> 14:25.303
Meurice.

14:25.680 --> 14:26.972
Sorry about last night.

14:27.056 --> 14:28.807
No sweat. Wasn't too busy.

14:28.891 --> 14:30.725
You missed a good one, though.

14:31.018 --> 14:35.397
This white guy walks in about 1:00 and
asks if we have a discount for alcoholics.

14:35.606 --> 14:38.316
Well, I tell him to get lost,
but now Marty's sitting here,

14:38.401 --> 14:41.277
and I can tell he's thinking that
maybe that ain't such a bad idea.

14:56.085 --> 14:57.252
Marty.

15:09.849 --> 15:12.199
Well, what?

15:13.561 --> 15:15.020
What, what?

15:15.104 --> 15:18.857
Am I fired? You wanna hit me, what?

15:20.109 --> 15:22.819
I don't particularly wanna talk to you.

15:25.114 --> 15:26.364
Well.

15:28.409 --> 15:31.202
You're not gonna fire me,
I might as well quit.

15:31.328 --> 15:32.454
Fine.

15:33.748 --> 15:35.248
Suit yourself.

15:39.628 --> 15:41.337
Having a good time?

15:43.841 --> 15:45.008
I don't like this kind of talk.

15:45.092 --> 15:46.801
What'd you come here for?

15:48.262 --> 15:50.263
You owe me for two weeks.

15:52.892 --> 15:53.933
No.

15:57.521 --> 15:59.814
She's an expensive piece of ass,

16:01.734 --> 16:04.569
but you get a refund if you tell me
who else she's been sluicing.

16:04.653 --> 16:06.538
I want that money.
You got something to tell me, fine.

16:06.622 --> 16:09.324
What are you,
a fucking marriage counselor?

16:09.408 --> 16:11.367
What are you smiling at?

16:11.827 --> 16:14.329
I'm funny, right? I'm an asshole?

16:14.997 --> 16:16.623
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

16:16.749 --> 16:18.374
That's not what's funny.

16:19.168 --> 16:20.919
What's funny is her.

16:21.670 --> 16:24.172
What's funny is that
I had you two followed.

16:24.340 --> 16:27.550
Because if it's not you
she's sleeping with, it's someone else.

16:27.635 --> 16:29.761
And what's really gonna be funny

16:30.179 --> 16:33.306
is when she gives you
that innocent look and says,

16:33.474 --> 16:36.434
"I don't know
what you're talking about, Ray.

16:36.769 --> 16:39.020
"I ain't done anything funny."

16:39.772 --> 16:43.316
But the funniest thing to me right now

16:44.193 --> 16:47.737
is that you think that
she came back here for you.

16:48.197 --> 16:50.731
That's what's fucking funny!

17:08.592 --> 17:12.220
Come on this property again,
I'll be forced to shoot you.

17:19.353 --> 17:20.811
Fair notice.

17:25.859 --> 17:27.402
Hey, Marty.

17:34.577 --> 17:36.870
Marty, I thought you were dead.

17:37.746 --> 17:39.080
You going home?

17:39.623 --> 17:40.665
No.

17:43.919 --> 17:46.254
I'm staying right here in hell.

17:47.756 --> 17:51.259
That's kind of a bleak point
of view there, isn't it, Marty?

17:53.053 --> 17:54.387
Meurice...

17:55.681 --> 17:58.808
I don't want the asshole near my money.

18:00.936 --> 18:02.896
And I don't want him in the bar.

18:04.315 --> 18:06.733
We get a lot of assholes in here, Marty.

18:24.168 --> 18:25.335
Hello?

18:38.974 --> 18:40.399
Marty?

18:43.646 --> 18:45.063
Who was it?

18:45.397 --> 18:46.481
What?

18:47.149 --> 18:49.108
- On the phone. Was it...
- Um...

18:51.820 --> 18:53.279
Was it for you?

18:53.364 --> 18:54.822
I don't know.

18:55.282 --> 18:56.658
He didn't say anything.

18:56.992 --> 18:58.701
How'd you know it was a he?

19:00.371 --> 19:01.913
You got a girl?

19:03.832 --> 19:06.209
Am I screwing something up by being here?

19:06.335 --> 19:07.335
No.

19:08.587 --> 19:09.671
Am I?

19:14.468 --> 19:17.845
I can find a place tomorrow,
and I'll be out of your hair.

19:17.930 --> 19:21.057
Well, if that's what you wanna do,
then you ought to do it.

19:36.782 --> 19:38.324
You...

19:40.327 --> 19:42.537
You want the bed or the couch?

19:43.706 --> 19:44.872
Well...

19:46.542 --> 19:48.084
Couch will be all right.

19:48.168 --> 19:50.712
You can sleep on the bed if you want.

19:54.883 --> 19:56.801
I'm not gonna put you out of your bed.

19:56.885 --> 19:58.886
You wouldn't be putting me out.

20:01.307 --> 20:03.224
I'll be all right here.

20:06.228 --> 20:07.312
Okay.

22:57.441 --> 22:58.566
Opal?

23:03.739 --> 23:06.073
Lover boy better lock his door.

23:08.535 --> 23:10.411
A lot of nuts out there.

23:22.883 --> 23:25.426
Let's do it outside in nature, hmm?

24:58.937 --> 25:02.147
Like to have seen his face
when he found the dead end.

25:07.571 --> 25:09.614
<i>Louie, Louie</i>

25:09.698 --> 25:12.283
<i>Oh, my baby</i>

25:12.367 --> 25:16.078
<i>Me gotta go, yeah</i>

25:18.248 --> 25:20.082
<i>Louie, Louie</i>

25:20.167 --> 25:23.336
Hey, mister, how'd you break
your pussy finger?

25:25.756 --> 25:27.548
I love it! I love it!

25:28.508 --> 25:30.635
You come up here a lot?

25:30.719 --> 25:31.802
Yeah?

25:32.554 --> 25:35.473
Well, I'm sorry, sweetheart,
my date is here.

25:36.725 --> 25:40.353
She saw me rolling a cigarette,
thought it was marijuana.

25:40.562 --> 25:42.938
Thought I was a swinger, I guess.

25:51.073 --> 25:52.531
<i>Louie, Louie</i>

26:10.467 --> 26:12.426
Isn't that wild?

26:18.600 --> 26:21.686
Stick your finger
up the wrong person's ass?

26:23.814 --> 26:25.314
You know,

26:25.649 --> 26:29.944
a friend of mine a while back
broke his hand and put it in a cast.

26:30.028 --> 26:31.987
The very next day, he falls,

26:32.072 --> 26:35.449
protects his bad hand
and he breaks his good one.

26:35.534 --> 26:37.868
So he breaks that, too, you know.

26:37.953 --> 26:40.287
So now he's got two busted flippers.

26:40.372 --> 26:41.372
You know?

26:41.456 --> 26:43.958
So I says to him, I said, "Creighton,"

26:44.126 --> 26:47.002
I says, "I hope your wife
really loves you,

26:47.087 --> 26:49.046
"'cause for the next five weeks,

26:49.131 --> 26:52.425
"you can't even wipe
your own goddamn ass."

26:58.098 --> 27:01.100
That's a test, ain't it?
A test of true love.

27:01.184 --> 27:02.977
I got a job for you.

27:07.190 --> 27:08.441
Well,

27:08.817 --> 27:11.944
if the pay is right and it's legal,
I'll do it.

27:12.988 --> 27:14.989
It's not strictly legal.

27:17.701 --> 27:19.744
Well, if the pay's right,

27:20.203 --> 27:21.579
I'll do it.

27:24.416 --> 27:27.501
It's in reference
to that gentleman and my wife.

27:28.670 --> 27:32.506
The more I think about it,
the more irritated I get.

27:33.550 --> 27:36.594
Yeah? Well, could you tell me what it is

27:36.678 --> 27:39.388
you want me to do, or is it a secret?

27:40.348 --> 27:42.016
This is no joke.

27:50.317 --> 27:52.276
You want me to kill them.

27:59.659 --> 28:00.743
Well?

28:01.203 --> 28:02.578
Well, what?

28:04.790 --> 28:06.457
What do you think?

28:07.334 --> 28:08.918
You're an idiot.

28:10.545 --> 28:12.880
So this won't interest you, huh?

28:12.964 --> 28:14.632
I didn't say that.

28:15.050 --> 28:17.468
All I said was, "You're an idiot."

28:18.720 --> 28:22.765
Hell, you been thinking about it
for so much, it's driving you simple.

28:22.849 --> 28:24.725
I'll give you $10,000.

28:29.439 --> 28:32.525
I'm supposed to do a murder,

28:33.318 --> 28:34.944
no, two murders,

28:35.987 --> 28:39.573
trust you not to go simple on me
and do something stupid.

28:40.700 --> 28:42.576
I mean, really stupid.

28:44.496 --> 28:46.664
Now, why should I trust you?

28:47.165 --> 28:48.666
For the money.

28:50.001 --> 28:51.168
Money.

28:52.254 --> 28:53.379
Yeah.

28:55.131 --> 28:57.633
That's a righteous amount of money.

29:02.639 --> 29:04.056
In Russia,

29:05.725 --> 29:07.977
they make only 50 cent a day.

29:23.285 --> 29:24.827
I want you

29:26.371 --> 29:28.122
to go fishing.

29:28.373 --> 29:29.373
What?

29:29.457 --> 29:31.834
Go down to Corpus for a few days,

29:32.586 --> 29:34.420
get yourself noticed.

29:34.504 --> 29:37.047
I'll give you a call when it's done.

29:37.924 --> 29:40.634
You just find a way to cover that money.

30:05.327 --> 30:09.580
I'll take care of the money.
You make sure those bodies aren't found.

30:14.419 --> 30:17.254
There's a big incinerator behind my place.

30:26.598 --> 30:31.168
So you want, like, a townhouse,
your own apartment.

30:38.234 --> 30:40.194
Come. I show you around.

30:40.528 --> 30:42.613
You sure this apartment
is vacant, Mrs. Estevez?

30:42.697 --> 30:44.323
Oh, yes. Yes, yes.

30:44.407 --> 30:47.743
I was just explaining to him
that he moved out yesterday.

30:47.827 --> 30:49.453
Don't mind Mr. Garcia.

30:49.537 --> 30:52.046
He used to be my brother-in-law.

30:53.792 --> 30:56.543
Looks like the state legislature's
already in session.

30:56.628 --> 30:59.380
Yeah, I thought this was where they met.

30:59.464 --> 31:01.340
Listen, you're gonna help me
with a problem.

31:01.424 --> 31:02.466
I am?

31:02.550 --> 31:05.344
You're gonna keep an eye on Marty
and Ray, make sure nothing happens.

31:05.428 --> 31:06.428
<i>How about it, gentlemen?</i>

31:06.513 --> 31:08.806
<i>Let's show our appreciation
for Lorraine up there,</i>

31:08.890 --> 31:11.141
<i>a registered nurse from Bolton, Texas.</i>

31:11.226 --> 31:13.352
<i>How about it, gentlemen? Yeah.</i>

31:14.396 --> 31:15.354
Thanks, Meurice.

31:15.438 --> 31:16.563
Anytime.

31:17.065 --> 31:19.233
Hey, you don't have to worry
about a thing for a while.

31:19.317 --> 31:21.068
Marty went down to Corpus yesterday.

31:24.447 --> 31:26.115
He's in the house.

31:28.743 --> 31:30.244
He's in the house.

31:30.328 --> 31:31.829
What's the matter?

31:31.913 --> 31:34.456
Could have sworn I heard something.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.626
Door's locked. There's nothing there.

31:39.462 --> 31:44.425
Well, I guess we wouldn't have heard
anything if it had been him.

31:44.926 --> 31:46.593
He's real careful.

31:48.930 --> 31:52.433
Fact is, he's anal, Ray.

31:54.394 --> 31:55.519
Oh?

31:55.603 --> 31:58.272
Uh-huh. He told me once himself.
He said to me,

32:00.275 --> 32:05.738
"In here, Abby. In here, I'm anal."

32:11.619 --> 32:12.953
Well, I'll be damned.

32:13.038 --> 32:14.913
I couldn't believe it myself.

32:19.085 --> 32:22.254
Me, on the other hand,
I got lots of personality.

32:23.590 --> 32:25.132
Marty always said I had too much.

32:25.216 --> 32:27.968
'Course, he was never big on personality.

32:28.762 --> 32:32.222
He sent me to a psychiatrist once,
to see if he could calm me down some.

32:32.682 --> 32:35.893
Yeah? And what happened?

32:36.061 --> 32:40.355
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest
person he ever met, so Marty fired him.

32:40.815 --> 32:43.150
I don't think you can fire
a psychiatrist, exactly.

32:43.234 --> 32:45.027
Well, I never saw him again,
I can tell you that much.

32:45.111 --> 32:46.070
Mmm-hmm.

32:46.154 --> 32:50.074
I said, "Marty, how come you're anal

32:50.158 --> 32:52.993
"and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?"

32:53.244 --> 32:54.453
What did he say?

32:55.038 --> 32:56.288
Nothing.

32:56.998 --> 32:59.458
He's like you. He doesn't say much.

32:59.542 --> 33:00.751
Well, thanks.

33:01.086 --> 33:03.253
Except when he doesn't say things,
they're usually nasty.

33:03.338 --> 33:04.296
Mmm-hmm.

33:04.380 --> 33:07.591
And when you don't, they're usually nice.

33:11.012 --> 33:12.471
Do you ever get tired?

33:12.555 --> 33:13.555
Hmm?

33:14.057 --> 33:15.724
Oh, yeah. I guess.

33:16.017 --> 33:17.017
Uh-huh.

36:28.584 --> 36:29.626
<i>Hello?</i>

36:29.711 --> 36:30.711
Marty?

36:30.878 --> 36:32.129
<i>Yeah.</i>

36:32.338 --> 36:33.880
Catch any fish?

36:35.174 --> 36:36.508
<i>What?</i>

36:36.592 --> 36:38.802
Did you catch any fish?

36:38.886 --> 36:40.345
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

36:40.430 --> 36:41.972
What kind of fish?

36:42.056 --> 36:44.016
<i>Listen, is it done?</i>

36:44.767 --> 36:47.311
Yes, sir. You owe me some money.

36:47.395 --> 36:49.813
<i>If you're fucking with me,
you'll regret it.</i>

37:00.199 --> 37:01.742
They look good.

37:03.494 --> 37:05.495
Why, you want a couple?

37:05.580 --> 37:07.748
Just the 10,000 will be fine.

37:13.796 --> 37:16.340
You got something to show me first?

37:57.215 --> 37:58.340
Dead?

37:58.424 --> 38:00.050
So it would seem.

38:07.433 --> 38:09.059
What did you do with the bodies?

38:09.143 --> 38:10.811
It's taken care of.

38:10.895 --> 38:13.688
Less you know about it, the better.

38:19.487 --> 38:20.695
Jesus.

38:21.906 --> 38:23.657
I don't believe it.

38:26.994 --> 38:27.994
Oh...

38:28.913 --> 38:30.580
I'm gonna be sick.

38:36.629 --> 38:39.005
I'm gonna want that picture back.

39:13.332 --> 39:16.084
You did say something about the money.

39:16.169 --> 39:17.544
Yeah, money.

39:19.130 --> 39:21.548
Something I gotta ask you, Marty.

39:22.467 --> 39:24.509
I been very, very careful.

39:25.678 --> 39:28.054
Have you been very, very careful?

39:28.890 --> 39:29.890
Of course.

39:29.974 --> 39:32.017
Nobody knows you hired me?

39:32.894 --> 39:34.478
Don't be stupid.

39:35.730 --> 39:37.939
I'm not about to tell anyone.

39:41.819 --> 39:44.237
We have to learn to be discreet.

39:46.741 --> 39:48.408
Trust each other.

39:58.836 --> 40:01.546
For richer or poorer.

40:02.215 --> 40:03.757
Don't say that.

40:04.091 --> 40:06.718
Your marriages don't turn out so hot.

40:08.554 --> 40:10.722
How did you cover the money?

40:11.015 --> 40:15.227
It's been taken care of,
and the less you know about it, the better.

40:17.897 --> 40:19.397
I made a call.

40:20.399 --> 40:21.858
It'll be all right.

40:22.109 --> 40:24.194
I must have gone mighty simple.

40:25.029 --> 40:28.156
A murder like this, too risky.

40:30.034 --> 40:32.452
Then you shouldn't have done it.

40:33.788 --> 40:35.789
Can't have it both ways.

40:51.180 --> 40:52.556
Count it...

40:54.141 --> 40:55.475
And go.

40:57.645 --> 40:59.929
No, I trust you.

42:18.934 --> 42:20.727
Who looks stupid now?

44:13.090 --> 44:14.174
Damn.

44:35.321 --> 44:36.588
Marty.

44:49.126 --> 44:51.419
What's the matter? You deaf?

47:08.390 --> 47:09.682
Come on.

47:11.936 --> 47:13.686
Marty, you home?

47:22.529 --> 47:24.080
Marty?

47:26.158 --> 47:28.242
What night is tonight, Diane?

47:28.327 --> 47:29.452
What night is it?

47:29.536 --> 47:30.578
Tuesday?

47:30.663 --> 47:32.872
Tuesday night is ladies' night.

47:32.957 --> 47:34.290
What?

47:34.375 --> 47:36.042
Tuesday night is ladies' night.

47:36.210 --> 47:38.519
All your drinks are free.

47:45.552 --> 47:49.138
<i>You're sweet as a honey bee</i>

47:49.223 --> 47:51.224
<i>But like a honey bee stings</i>

47:51.308 --> 47:53.559
<i>You've gone and left my heart in pain</i>

47:53.644 --> 47:57.355
<i>All you left is our favorite song</i>

47:57.439 --> 48:00.858
<i>The one we danced to all night long</i>

48:00.943 --> 48:04.654
<i>It used to bring sweet memories</i>

48:04.738 --> 48:08.533
<i>Of a tender love that used to be</i>

48:08.617 --> 48:11.953
<i>Now it's the same old song</i>

48:12.579 --> 48:16.624
<i>But with a different meaning
since you've been gone</i>

48:16.709 --> 48:19.836
<i>It's the same, same old song</i>

48:19.920 --> 48:24.007
<i>But with a different meaning
since you've been gone</i>

48:24.425 --> 48:27.385
<i>I, oh, I</i>

48:27.502 --> 48:31.472
<i>Sentimental fool am I</i>

48:32.808 --> 48:35.601
<i>To hear an old love song and wanna cry</i>

48:35.686 --> 48:39.522
<i>But the melody keeps haunting me</i>

48:39.606 --> 48:43.234
<i>Reminding me how in love we used to be</i>

48:43.318 --> 48:46.863
<i>I keep hearing the part
that used to touch our hearts</i>

48:46.947 --> 48:51.200
<i>Saying together forever
Darling, breaking up never</i>

48:51.285 --> 48:53.870
<i>It's the same old song</i>

48:53.954 --> 48:54.912
<i>Ain't glad to hear it</i>

48:54.997 --> 48:58.791
<i>But with a different meaning
since you've been gone</i>

48:58.876 --> 49:01.794
<i>It's the same old song</i>

49:02.171 --> 49:06.632
<i>But with a different meaning
since you've been gone</i>

49:10.679 --> 49:13.473
<i>We used to dance to the music...</i>

49:45.631 --> 49:50.468
<i>...has increased over 80%
in the last three years.</i>

49:51.512 --> 49:53.971
<i>And what's more, in two years' time,</i>

49:54.056 --> 49:58.518
<i>we'll be experiencing
what's known as the Jupiter effect,</i>

49:58.852 --> 50:02.772
<i>wherein all the planets
of the known universe will be lined up,</i>

50:02.856 --> 50:07.235
<i>causing an incredible wave
of destructive power...</i>

50:10.405 --> 50:13.116
<i>...in John 6:18,</i>

50:13.659 --> 50:18.663
<i>the Lord out and tells us
that these are the signs</i>

50:18.747 --> 50:22.208
<i>by which we shall know
that he is among us.</i>

50:24.711 --> 50:27.880
<i>There are many good people
who disagree with me,</i>

50:27.965 --> 50:34.428
<i>but it is my belief that
this Antichrist is alive today</i>

50:35.347 --> 50:39.392
<i>and living in that ten-nation alliance
I spoke of earlier.</i>

50:41.937 --> 50:46.031
<i>This is WKLJ through the night.</i>

50:47.317 --> 50:49.235
<i>And I'm John Lievsay.</i>

50:49.903 --> 50:52.738
<i>I'll be here with you
till 6:00 this morning,</i>

50:52.823 --> 50:55.858
<i>when Mike Miller will be stepping in.</i>

50:58.203 --> 51:00.913
<i>Here's a request we really had to dig for.</i>

51:00.998 --> 51:03.833
<i>It's another song
from south of the border.</i>

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.294
<i>Yeah?</i>

01:00:50.378 --> 01:00:52.379
Abby, you all right?

01:00:53.214 --> 01:00:55.549
<i>Ray? What time is it?</i>

01:00:55.633 --> 01:00:57.092
I don't know.

01:00:57.510 --> 01:00:58.886
It's early.

01:01:00.805 --> 01:01:02.181
I love you.

01:01:05.143 --> 01:01:06.643
<i>You all right?</i>

01:01:07.353 --> 01:01:08.812
I don't know.

01:01:09.522 --> 01:01:11.190
I better get off now.

01:01:11.357 --> 01:01:13.567
<i>Well, I'll see you.</i>

01:01:14.694 --> 01:01:16.320
<i>And thanks, Ray.</i>

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:18.805
Abby...

01:02:05.119 --> 01:02:06.411
Hey, Ray.

01:04:21.714 --> 01:04:24.091
Why didn't you get into bed?

01:04:24.175 --> 01:04:26.385
I didn't think I could sleep.

01:04:27.845 --> 01:04:29.805
Surprised you could.

01:04:31.307 --> 01:04:33.475
You called me this morning.

01:04:34.310 --> 01:04:35.394
Yeah.

01:04:37.605 --> 01:04:40.440
I just wanted to let you know
that everything is all right.

01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:42.651
I took care of everything.

01:04:43.695 --> 01:04:46.363
Now all we have to do is keep our heads.

01:04:46.447 --> 01:04:47.948
What do you mean?

01:04:48.032 --> 01:04:49.408
I know about it, Abby.

01:04:51.786 --> 01:04:53.495
I went to the bar last night.

01:04:53.579 --> 01:04:54.663
What happened?

01:04:54.747 --> 01:04:55.956
Was Meurice there?

01:04:56.082 --> 01:04:57.290
Yeah.

01:04:59.085 --> 01:05:01.086
He didn't see me, though.

01:05:03.131 --> 01:05:04.631
Nobody saw me.

01:05:06.092 --> 01:05:07.843
Is it cold in here?

01:05:08.469 --> 01:05:10.262
Well, what happened?

01:05:14.434 --> 01:05:17.519
I cleaned it all up.
But that ain't important.

01:05:18.438 --> 01:05:20.188
What's important is what we do now.

01:05:20.273 --> 01:05:22.524
I mean, we can't go around half-cocked.

01:05:26.279 --> 01:05:29.322
What we need is time to think about this,

01:05:30.116 --> 01:05:31.408
figure it out.

01:05:31.617 --> 01:05:33.785
Anyway, we got some time now.

01:05:34.704 --> 01:05:36.663
We gotta be smart.

01:05:36.748 --> 01:05:37.748
Ray...

01:05:37.832 --> 01:05:40.876
Abby, you should never point a gun
at anyone unless you mean to shoot him,

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:43.712
and if you shoot him,
you better make sure he's dead.

01:05:43.796 --> 01:05:46.131
'Cause if he ain't dead,
he's gonna get up and try and kill you.

01:05:46.215 --> 01:05:50.385
The only thing they taught us in
the service that's worth a God damn.

01:05:54.348 --> 01:05:56.266
Where in the hell's my windbreaker?

01:05:58.770 --> 01:05:59.936
Ray...

01:06:01.814 --> 01:06:03.899
Just tell me what happened.

01:06:06.527 --> 01:06:08.403
That ain't important.

01:06:09.781 --> 01:06:13.408
What's important is that we did it.
That's the only thing that matters.

01:06:13.493 --> 01:06:15.744
We both did it for each other.

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:17.412
That's what's important.

01:06:17.497 --> 01:06:20.123
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:06:23.586 --> 01:06:26.338
I mean, what are you talking about?

01:06:28.132 --> 01:06:30.342
I haven't done anything funny.

01:06:32.929 --> 01:06:34.179
What was that?

01:06:34.263 --> 01:06:36.389
Ray, you're not even acting like yourself.

01:06:36.474 --> 01:06:40.268
First you call me at 5:00 in the a.m.,
saying all kind of nice things on the phone,

01:06:40.353 --> 01:06:42.437
and then you come charging in here,
scaring me half to death,

01:06:42.522 --> 01:06:46.191
without even telling me
what I'm supposed to be scared of.

01:06:48.027 --> 01:06:51.780
I mean, if you two had a fight
or something, I don't care.

01:06:54.492 --> 01:06:56.551
Just as long as...

01:07:03.626 --> 01:07:05.001
Pick it up.

01:07:16.722 --> 01:07:18.106
What?

01:07:34.198 --> 01:07:35.824
Well, that's him.

01:07:38.035 --> 01:07:39.077
Who?

01:07:39.912 --> 01:07:41.079
Marty.

01:07:55.219 --> 01:07:57.429
What's going on with you two?

01:08:12.111 --> 01:08:13.445
All right.

01:08:18.492 --> 01:08:21.118
You can call him back, whoever it was.

01:08:23.788 --> 01:08:25.790
I'll get out of your way.

01:08:35.426 --> 01:08:37.551
You left your weapon behind.

01:08:55.287 --> 01:08:58.073
<i>Hi, Meurice, this is Helene,
Helene Trend, you know?</i>

01:08:58.157 --> 01:09:00.242
<i>And I'm calling 'cause I wanna know
just what the hell that remark</i>

01:09:00.326 --> 01:09:01.743
<i>you made about Sylvia is supposed to mean.</i>

01:09:01.827 --> 01:09:03.912
<i>She said you're full of shit,
and frankly, I believe her.</i>

01:09:03.996 --> 01:09:05.497
<i>And, hey, I love you, too, sure.</i>

01:09:05.581 --> 01:09:06.790
<i>Anyway, you better call me soon,</i>

01:09:06.874 --> 01:09:10.072
<i>'cause I'm going to South America
tonight, you know, Uruguay.</i>

01:09:10.161 --> 01:09:13.505
<i>Listen, asshole, it's Marty.
I just got back from Corpus Christi,</i>

01:09:13.589 --> 01:09:16.883
<i>and there's a lot of money missing
from the safe. A lot of money.</i>

01:09:16.968 --> 01:09:20.636
<i>I'm not saying you took it, but the place
was your responsibility, Meurice,</i>

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:23.555
<i>and I told you to keep an eye
on your asshole friend.</i>

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:26.291
<i>Don't come to the bar tonight.
I got some...</i>

01:09:26.377 --> 01:09:28.435
<i>Damn machine. What is this?</i>

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:30.229
<i>The bar is still gonna be closed tonight.</i>

01:09:30.314 --> 01:09:31.939
<i>I got some other business to take care of,</i>

01:09:32.024 --> 01:09:35.694
<i>but tomorrow I wanna have
a word with you and with Ray,</i>

01:09:35.778 --> 01:09:36.861
<i>if you can find him.</i>

01:10:12.064 --> 01:10:14.399
I hope you're planning on leaving town.

01:10:14.775 --> 01:10:15.900
You got a problem, Meurice?

01:10:15.985 --> 01:10:17.485
No, but you do, cowboy.

01:10:17.611 --> 01:10:19.154
Have you been to the bar?

01:10:20.656 --> 01:10:21.656
Why?

01:10:21.741 --> 01:10:23.616
You shouldn't have taken
the fucking money!

01:10:23.701 --> 01:10:26.119
Look at me, man. Now, I'm serious.

01:10:26.203 --> 01:10:28.747
You broke in the bar,
and you ripped off the fucking safe.

01:10:28.831 --> 01:10:30.373
Abby warned me about you.

01:10:30.458 --> 01:10:31.833
You know what your problem is?

01:10:31.917 --> 01:10:33.501
You're too fucking obvious.

01:10:33.586 --> 01:10:37.297
The only two people with the combination
are you and me, and Abby, maybe.

01:10:37.381 --> 01:10:40.592
These fucking things
are nothing but coffin nails.

01:10:41.719 --> 01:10:45.472
Hey, look, Ray, personally
I don't give a shit, you know.

01:10:45.556 --> 01:10:48.350
Look, man, I know Marty's a hard-on,
but you gotta do something.

01:10:48.434 --> 01:10:52.729
Say you're sorry, give the money back,
get the fuck out of here, or something.

01:10:55.107 --> 01:10:56.107
Shit.

01:10:58.402 --> 01:11:02.280
Hey, look, man, this is very humiliating,
preaching about this bullshit.

01:11:04.825 --> 01:11:08.453
But I'm not laughing, Ray Bob,
so you know it's no fucking joke.

01:11:32.269 --> 01:11:33.269
Damn.

01:15:47.650 --> 01:15:48.733
Ray?

01:16:26.897 --> 01:16:29.273
Lover boy ought to lock the door.

01:16:31.443 --> 01:16:32.777
I love you.

01:16:35.447 --> 01:16:37.949
That's a stupid thing to say, right?

01:16:40.703 --> 01:16:42.286
I love you, too.

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:44.122
No.

01:16:46.458 --> 01:16:49.168
You're just saying that
because you're scared.

01:16:55.134 --> 01:16:57.427
You left your weapon behind.

01:17:00.431 --> 01:17:02.481
He'll kill you, too.

01:17:44.016 --> 01:17:45.057
Ray?

01:17:56.987 --> 01:17:58.738
Where is everything?

01:18:02.367 --> 01:18:03.868
In the trunk.

01:18:07.206 --> 01:18:08.581
In the car.

01:18:13.754 --> 01:18:15.171
You leaving?

01:18:15.672 --> 01:18:17.673
Isn't that what you want?

01:18:21.094 --> 01:18:23.012
You wanna come with me?

01:18:23.639 --> 01:18:26.057
I gotta know what happened first.

01:18:40.447 --> 01:18:42.240
What you wanna know?

01:18:44.243 --> 01:18:47.328
You broke into the bar
and you wanted to get your money.

01:18:47.412 --> 01:18:50.055
And you and Marty
had a fight or something.

01:18:51.834 --> 01:18:54.252
Well, I don't know. Wasn't it you?

01:18:57.422 --> 01:19:00.007
- Maybe a burglar broke in and then...
- With your gun.

01:19:01.802 --> 01:19:03.678
Nobody broke in, Abby.

01:19:06.348 --> 01:19:08.307
I'll tell you the truth.

01:19:15.274 --> 01:19:17.024
Truth is that...

01:19:19.903 --> 01:19:22.780
I been feeling sick
the last couple of days.

01:19:26.285 --> 01:19:27.785
I can't sleep.

01:19:29.955 --> 01:19:31.289
Can't eat.

01:19:34.293 --> 01:19:35.751
When I try...

01:19:44.595 --> 01:19:45.720
Ab.

01:19:51.977 --> 01:19:53.311
Truth is...

01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:58.733
He was alive when I buried him.

01:20:16.710 --> 01:20:19.786
Yeah, yeah. Just a second.

01:20:24.009 --> 01:20:25.551
Abby, what's the matter?

01:20:25.636 --> 01:20:28.012
I think Marty's dead. Can I come in?

01:20:30.766 --> 01:20:34.143
That's bullshit.
Marty called me after he was jacked up.

01:20:57.167 --> 01:21:00.252
I don't know where Marty is,
but he's not dead.

01:21:00.754 --> 01:21:03.172
Now, you relax, and I'll go find him.

01:21:03.256 --> 01:21:06.362
And stay away from Ray.
The guy's gone nuts.

01:22:49.654 --> 01:22:51.030
Turn it off.

01:22:55.243 --> 01:22:56.410
Ray.

01:23:00.749 --> 01:23:02.374
Just turn it off!

01:23:05.212 --> 01:23:06.295
Why?

01:23:08.882 --> 01:23:10.800
No curtains on the windows.

01:23:12.302 --> 01:23:13.344
So?

01:23:16.139 --> 01:23:17.431
I think someone's watching.

01:23:17.516 --> 01:23:18.849
So what'll they see?

01:23:19.101 --> 01:23:21.519
Just leave it off. He can see in.

01:23:22.771 --> 01:23:25.564
You do anything, the neighbors will hear.

01:23:32.697 --> 01:23:34.115
You...

01:23:36.201 --> 01:23:37.868
Abby, I meant it.

01:23:39.538 --> 01:23:41.038
When I called.

01:23:43.416 --> 01:23:45.042
I love you, too.

01:23:45.836 --> 01:23:47.336
But you're scared.

01:25:45.497 --> 01:25:46.914
All right.

01:25:47.374 --> 01:25:50.459
Now, you've got some
personal property of mine.

01:26:02.514 --> 01:26:04.139
What did you do?

01:26:14.442 --> 01:26:18.362
Now, I don't know what the hell
you two thought you was gonna pull off.

01:32:23.227 --> 01:32:25.437
I'm not afraid of you, Marty.

01:32:45.875 --> 01:32:48.752
Well, ma'am, if I see him,

01:32:49.587 --> 01:32:51.880
I'll sure give him the message.

01:33:18.908 --> 01:33:22.369
<i>You're sweet as a honey bee</i>

01:33:22.453 --> 01:33:26.540
<i>But like a honey bee stings
You've gone and left my heart in pain</i>

01:33:26.624 --> 01:33:30.711
<i>All you left is our favorite song</i>

01:33:30.795 --> 01:33:34.005
<i>The one we danced to all night long</i>

01:33:34.090 --> 01:33:37.968
<i>It used to bring sweet memories</i>

01:33:38.136 --> 01:33:41.680
<i>Of a tender love that used to be</i>

01:33:41.764 --> 01:33:45.475
<i>Now it's the same old song</i>

01:33:45.601 --> 01:33:49.563
<i>But with a different meaning
since you've been gone</i>

01:33:49.647 --> 01:33:52.816
<i>It's the same, same old song</i>

01:33:53.276 --> 01:33:55.193
<i>But with a different meaning
since you've been gone</i>

01:33:55.278 --> 01:33:57.571
<i>And it breaks me up to hear it</i>

01:33:57.655 --> 01:34:00.490
<i>I, oh, I</i>

01:34:00.575 --> 01:34:04.119
<i>Sentimental fool am I</i>

01:34:04.829 --> 01:34:08.874
<i>To hear an old love song and wanna cry</i>

01:34:08.958 --> 01:34:12.586
<i>But the melody keeps haunting me</i>

01:34:13.087 --> 01:34:16.548
<i>Reminding me how in love we used to be</i>

01:34:16.632 --> 01:34:20.177
<i>I keep hearing the part
that used to touch our hearts</i>

01:34:20.261 --> 01:34:24.097
<i>Saying together forever
Darling, breaking up never</i>

01:34:24.182 --> 01:34:27.976
<i>It's the same old song
Ain't glad to hear it</i>

01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:32.022
<i>But with a different meaning
since you've been gone</i>

01:34:32.106 --> 01:34:35.025
<i>It's the same old song</i>

01:34:35.485 --> 01:34:39.529
<i>But with a different meaning
since you've been gone</i>

01:34:58.633 --> 01:35:02.260
<i>We used to dance to the music
We used to dance to the music</i>

01:35:02.345 --> 01:35:06.640
<i>Make romance to the music
Make romance to the music</i>

01:35:06.724 --> 01:35:09.392
<i>It's the same old song</i>

01:35:10.102 --> 01:35:13.897
<i>But with a different meaning
since you've been gone</i>

01:35:13.981 --> 01:35:17.108
<i>Now it's the same old song</i>

01:35:17.735 --> 01:35:21.696
<i>But with a different meaning
since you've been gone</i>

01:35:22.073 --> 01:35:25.534
<i>I, oh, I can't bear to hear it</i>

01:35:25.618 --> 01:35:28.703
<i>It's the same old song</i>

01:35:29.163 --> 01:35:33.166
<i>But with a different meaning
since you've been gone</i>

01:35:33.251 --> 01:35:36.419
<i>It's the same old song</i>

01:35:36.879 --> 01:35:40.590
<i>But with a different meaning
since you've been gone</i>
