00:49.750 --> 00:52.220
(DRUMS: ROCK BEAT)

00:55.223 --> 00:58.859
Like, wow. Like, crap.
Last year I was
a high school brat.

00:58.859 --> 01:01.829
But now I'm here.
Hope I'm the one
you pick to cheer!

01:01.829 --> 01:04.665
Fantastic!
I'm sorry. What?

01:04.665 --> 01:08.269
Oh, nothing. Don't let me
slow you down. It's just...
Well, you're a surprise.

01:08.269 --> 01:11.139
How do you mean?
You have great spirit.

01:11.139 --> 01:13.207
But just a tad
more volume,
if you would.

01:13.207 --> 01:16.144
I apologize.
Continue.

01:16.144 --> 01:20.148
Like, whoo. Like, whee.
I'm at the university.

01:20.148 --> 01:23.617
I'm psyched. I'm here.
Hope I'm the one
you choose to cheer.

01:23.617 --> 01:27.321
I yell real loud and make
the Stingers super proud!

01:27.821 --> 01:30.124
Brilliant!

01:30.124 --> 01:33.161
My dear,
you are wonderful...
cheer genius personified.

01:33.161 --> 01:34.495
A real individual.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.666
I'm joking, you spaz!

01:38.666 --> 01:41.569
Pardon me?
That was a cheer?

01:41.569 --> 01:45.639
That was the most boring,
unoriginal, biggest piece
of crap I've ever seen!

01:45.639 --> 01:47.241
You suck!
(GASPS)

01:48.476 --> 01:51.679

01:51.679 --> 01:53.581
(CACKLING CONTINUES)
(SCREAMING)

01:57.151 --> 02:00.521
Mom, where are we?
Where are you, dear?

02:00.521 --> 02:03.391
You finally made it.
You're in college.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.195
(CHATTERING)

02:08.229 --> 02:09.330
Oh, man!

(HIP-HOP)

02:12.300 --> 02:14.868

The big game
is just about rockin'

02:26.547 --> 02:30.751
(CHATTERING)

02:30.751 --> 02:33.787
Hi. Can you guys tell me
how to get to Bancroft Hall?

02:33.787 --> 02:36.890
Hi. Can you tell me
how to get to...

02:36.890 --> 02:37.958
Hi, girls.
Can you guys tell me
how to get to Bancroft...

02:37.958 --> 02:41.262
Excuse me!

02:41.262 --> 02:42.830
Hi. It's where some
of the cheerleaders
are staying.

02:42.830 --> 02:45.333
Um, I'm trying out
for the team.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.468
You girls don't cheer,
do you?

02:47.468 --> 02:50.538
First of all,
it's women, not girls.

02:50.538 --> 02:53.641
Oh.
Second, um, we do
neo-modern ballet.

02:53.641 --> 02:56.510
We don't wave pom-poms.

02:56.510 --> 02:59.747
And third,
we can't direct you
to Bancroft Hall,

02:59.747 --> 03:02.750
because Nathaniel Bancroft
was a slave owner
and an imperialist!

03:04.418 --> 03:07.755
Okay. Thanks.

03:07.755 --> 03:09.890
Appreciate it.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.959
You're not giving
up already, are you?
Monica!

03:11.959 --> 03:15.896
(BOTH GIGGLING)

03:15.896 --> 03:17.931
First day of college,
I'm already saving
my roommate.

03:17.931 --> 03:19.933
You did not
have to save me.
I have been saving...

03:19.933 --> 03:21.635
your butt ever since
cheerleader camp.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.237
Have not!

03:23.237 --> 03:26.006
Really?
I remember a time...

03:26.006 --> 03:28.442
a spotter was
out of position and
one of our cheerleaders...

03:28.442 --> 03:30.811
was gonna do
a face-plant.

03:30.811 --> 03:33.381
Who was that
cheerleader again?
Okay. Okay. I get it.

03:33.381 --> 03:35.783
(LAUGHING) I think
the score is Monica, two.
Whittier, zero.

03:35.783 --> 03:38.486
And... Bancroft Hall
is this way.

03:38.486 --> 03:41.422
Did you know
that Nathaniel Bancroft
was a slave owner...

03:41.422 --> 03:43.957
and an imperialist?
Our room has
a ceiling fan.

03:45.759 --> 03:49.597
MAN: As well as
paint balloons,
panty trees,

03:49.597 --> 03:53.000
super-gluing faculty doors,
releasing lab animals...

03:53.000 --> 03:56.470
and most important,
I'd like to remind you...

03:56.470 --> 03:58.005
that if you must...

03:58.005 --> 04:00.374
urinate,

04:00.374 --> 04:02.576
please...
do it in a toilet.

04:03.944 --> 04:08.282
Do not... I repeat...
Do not urinate...

04:08.282 --> 04:11.385
on an original manuscript
of The Canterbury Tales...

04:11.385 --> 04:14.422
located in
the school library.

04:14.422 --> 04:16.724
You writing this down?
You'd think I wouldn't
have to say that.

04:16.724 --> 04:19.560
The Nutcracker
is a patriarchal ballet.

04:19.560 --> 04:22.796
Okay? The only good thing
in The Nutcracker
are the rats, and they die.

04:22.796 --> 04:24.532
(GRUNTING)

04:26.767 --> 04:30.871
Shakespeare. Hamlet?

04:30.871 --> 04:32.940
"Euripidie..."
Euri... Eur...

04:34.475 --> 04:36.744
Euripides.

04:36.744 --> 04:39.980
Lastly, we hope
you take advantage of
the many extracurriculars...

04:39.980 --> 04:42.015
here at the university.

04:42.015 --> 04:44.918
Although I must report
we've had to cut funding...

04:44.918 --> 04:47.821
to some of the more
non-essential programs...

04:47.821 --> 04:51.325
on campus such as
the martial arts club,

04:51.325 --> 04:54.428
the ballet society...
(GASPS) Wha...

04:54.428 --> 04:56.897
and the entire musical
theater department.

04:56.897 --> 04:58.799
MAN: That's
a worthwhile program!

04:58.799 --> 05:04.938
Fortunately, we haven't
had to cut any money from
our two prized programs...

05:04.938 --> 05:06.740
the football team...
That's right!
(BARKING)

05:08.509 --> 05:12.045
Yeah!
and... your seven-time...

05:12.045 --> 05:16.484
defending collegiate champion
Stinger cheerleading squad!

05:16.484 --> 05:17.651
Yea!
Let's hear it

05:44.111 --> 05:46.680
Hey, everybody!
I'm Tina Hammersmith!

05:46.680 --> 05:48.849
(EXCITED SQUEAL)

05:48.849 --> 05:50.918
Y'all ready to rock
the body electric?

05:50.918 --> 05:54.788
Ahhh!
Let's get this
party started!

05:54.788 --> 05:56.457
Five, six,
seven, eight!

05:56.457 --> 05:58.559
(TECHNO POP)

06:28.722 --> 06:29.823

06:33.894 --> 06:37.164
GIRL: Yeah!
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
You go, girl!

06:37.164 --> 06:39.099
CHEERLEADERS:
Two, three, four...

06:39.099 --> 06:42.903
Stingers in the house!
We're on the attack!

06:42.903 --> 06:45.506
That's right!
Got no extra fat!

06:45.506 --> 06:47.941
We don't eat Big Macs!
It's gross!

06:47.941 --> 06:51.712
Step to us!
You might get smacked!
TINA: Whacked!

06:51.712 --> 06:55.182
We got more game
than the man
they call Shaq!

06:55.182 --> 06:59.152
The moonwalk! The twist!
The shake and bake!
The what?

06:59.152 --> 07:02.556
We can do it all
right here at State!

07:02.556 --> 07:05.893
Strap yourself in
so your mind won't blow!

07:05.893 --> 07:08.662
Sit back, relax
and enjoy the show!

07:15.469 --> 07:17.070
What's wrong
with you people?
Stop it!

07:22.242 --> 07:24.612
Yeah! Stingers!

07:24.612 --> 07:27.615
This is terrible.
What do you mean
"terrible"?

07:27.615 --> 07:30.784
They're perfect.
I know.
That's what's terrible.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.086
They are perfect.

07:33.086 --> 07:36.724
Speaking of perfect.
You ever checked out
your own ass?

07:36.724 --> 07:38.892
Whoa!
Gross!

07:38.892 --> 07:41.729
Just pay him no mind.
No. No. I think
we should pay him mind.

07:41.729 --> 07:45.065
I mean, this...
this man has a lot to say.
I do.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.735
I have a lot to say.
He's a unique individual.

07:47.735 --> 07:50.904
Very unique individual.
With his own thoughts
and ideas.

07:50.904 --> 07:53.907
My own thoughts.
My own ideas.

07:53.907 --> 07:56.810
Who would never
make a fool of himself.
Never ever...

07:56.810 --> 07:59.913
make a fool of myself.
Even if he was blindly
mimicking whatever I said.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.148
Even if I was blindly...
(LAUGHS)

08:05.152 --> 08:07.988
Hey, punk.
Be watchin' you.

08:10.591 --> 08:11.759
Smart guy.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.729
Thank you.
No problem.

08:24.171 --> 08:27.140
Belly ring?
No belly ring?

08:27.140 --> 08:29.042
It's a cheerleading tryout.
They're going to be looking
at your moves,

08:29.042 --> 08:31.812
not your body jewelry.
Oh, I know.

08:31.812 --> 08:34.881
But here's my theory:
if they concentrate
on my belly,

08:34.881 --> 08:37.183
they won't recognize
if I mess up on
my back handsprings.

08:37.183 --> 08:40.020
Whit, you're not
gonna mess up. I've seen
your cheer skills.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.089
They're for real.

08:42.089 --> 08:43.890
Maybe for high school,
but this is college.

08:43.890 --> 08:46.627
And in college
you have to be the poo.

08:46.627 --> 08:49.663
Well, that shaggy boy
at orientation sure
thought you were the poo.

08:49.663 --> 08:52.600
(GIGGLES)
He was all on you
like ugly on an Osbourne.

08:53.601 --> 08:54.768
Him?

08:56.904 --> 08:57.805
You think?

08:59.773 --> 09:00.941
He did smile at me.

09:00.941 --> 09:03.777
Mm-hmm.

09:03.777 --> 09:06.814
But I can't lose
my concentration. I've really
got to focus on tomorrow.

09:06.814 --> 09:08.716
I got to work
on my cheer moves.
Hit it, girl.

09:08.716 --> 09:10.618

09:14.154 --> 09:15.756

09:21.328 --> 09:24.732
Before we begin,
I want you to know that
just by trying out today,

09:24.732 --> 09:27.100
you're already a winner.
(GIGGLING)

09:27.100 --> 09:29.870
Unless, of course,
you get cut.
In which case,

09:29.870 --> 09:31.238
technically you're a loser.
(CLEARS THROAT)

09:32.640 --> 09:35.175
(CAMERA WHIRS)
So, go for it.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.977
Okay, I'll start
with a simple aerial.

09:36.977 --> 09:40.881
No, I was thinking more
of a front handspring,

09:40.881 --> 09:43.717
back handspring,
front handspring,

09:43.717 --> 09:46.086
back handspring,
back handspring,

09:46.086 --> 09:48.321
front handspring,
back handspring...

09:48.321 --> 09:52.726
Okay! Give me an "S-S."
Give me a "T-R." Err!

10:03.236 --> 10:04.972
(RAPPING CONTINUES)

10:26.827 --> 10:29.930
That was awesome.
So, do you got
any good cheers?

10:29.930 --> 10:32.365
I got something for ya.
I got a little shout out.
You got a what?

10:32.365 --> 10:36.704
I got to give
a shout out to all
my people, baby! Whoo!

10:36.704 --> 10:39.139
I'm flossin'!
You can't see me.
I got the ice.

10:39.139 --> 10:42.175
It's just blindin' ya!
Peace, and I'm out!

10:42.175 --> 10:45.345
Back handspring,
front handspring, cartwheel,
back handspring, cartwheel...

10:45.345 --> 10:47.380
(CONTINUES)

11:00.427 --> 11:03.396
Give me an "S-S".
Give me a "T-R".

11:03.396 --> 11:06.366
I just screwed up again!
Dang it!
I can't believe it! No!

11:06.366 --> 11:10.771
Just kill me right now!
Bam! Haha! Please?

11:10.771 --> 11:14.107
Front handspring,
cartwheel, back handspring,
back handspring, cartwheel...

11:14.107 --> 11:15.142
Ooh.

11:17.978 --> 11:20.147
Ohh, yeah!
Oh, my God.

11:20.147 --> 11:21.281
Thanks for coming.

11:25.853 --> 11:28.488
(CAMERA WHIRS)

11:28.488 --> 11:31.124
And lastly,
Smith, comma, Whittier.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.994
Okay. So...
Wait.

11:35.095 --> 11:36.997
What is it?
That thing.

11:36.997 --> 11:39.767
That shiny
offensive thing...
midsection.

11:39.767 --> 11:41.802
Oh, that's my belly ring.
Lose it immediately.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.972
Okay. Sorry.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.320
Um.
(CLATTERING)

12:02.289 --> 12:04.191
Okay. Are you ready?
How about, are you ready?

12:07.194 --> 12:08.195
I think so.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.498
Here I go! Hit it!

Eczema.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.507
It's called lotion.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.509
Theo.
Too gay!

12:56.509 --> 12:58.178
Patrick?
Not gay enough.

12:59.412 --> 13:01.148
(CHUCKLES)
And finally, Whittier.

13:05.185 --> 13:08.822
She's okay.
Okay? Marni, she's future
head cheerleader material.

13:08.822 --> 13:13.193
Memo, pink ink,
we already have our future
head cheerleader. Hi.

13:13.193 --> 13:15.128
(CHUCKLES) The only
difference being,
she's cute.

13:17.230 --> 13:20.500
Yeah, she's cute the way
a smushed-up bug is cute.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.336
Oh, and excuse me.
Did you see her
blond hair?

13:23.336 --> 13:26.073
So fake!
(SCOFFS)

13:26.073 --> 13:28.976
Well, if that's not the pot
calling the kettle blond.

13:28.976 --> 13:32.412
Ohh! I was...
I was born
with dark roots.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.915
Mm-hmm.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.149
Well, anyway,
I'd be all over her.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.023
You know,
if she had a schwinger.
Maybe she does.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.225
TINA: Enough!

13:45.225 --> 13:47.861
You two bitches can catfight
all night, but I'm the one
that makes the decisions.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.064
Until I do...
you're dismissed.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.267
Leave me.

13:57.370 --> 13:58.939
Ow! (COUGHS)

No time
for rest, cherub.

14:09.349 --> 14:12.619
I didn't know
you were here.
I've been here six hours.

14:12.619 --> 14:16.123
Saw every last
peppy pigtail that passed
through this place.

14:16.123 --> 14:17.925
Pretty ugly, huh?

Some were ugly.

Some were hideous.

14:20.493 --> 14:23.663
While others were sublime.

14:23.663 --> 14:26.166
I'm talking about State's
next head cheerleader.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.468
Smith, comma, Whittier.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.172
Whittier can't be head
cheerleader next year.

14:32.172 --> 14:35.342
She's just a freshman.
She's just good
is what she is.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.544
But the head
cheerleader spot
is reserved for Marni.

14:37.544 --> 14:40.647
Tina!
The State cheerleading
squad has won...

14:40.647 --> 14:43.583
seven consecutive
national titles,

14:43.583 --> 14:46.419
which over that time has
tripled alumni donations...

14:46.419 --> 14:48.488
and allowed me the life
to which I am accustomed.

14:50.190 --> 14:53.626
Just last year,
I upgraded...

14:53.626 --> 14:56.463
from an '88 Jetta
to a 2003 Passat.

14:56.463 --> 14:58.999
Wow.
I'm not about to throw
all that away...

14:58.999 --> 15:02.669
over some brown-nosing
mediocrity named Marni.

15:02.669 --> 15:05.372
Whittier might
have what it takes,
but she's awfully raw.

15:06.606 --> 15:10.443
That, dear, is why
you must mold her.

15:10.443 --> 15:13.080
Shape her. Twist her
like Silly Putty.

15:14.614 --> 15:17.450
If you make her
half as great
as you are,

15:17.450 --> 15:19.552
the national title
will stay here
for years to come.

15:21.588 --> 15:24.091
Remember
the school motto...
Whatever it takes.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.658
I can't hear you.
(STAMPS FLOOR)

15:25.658 --> 15:26.659

15:43.443 --> 15:45.445
Is that gonna be
too small for you?
Kidding!

15:45.445 --> 15:46.946
Kidding!
Get outta here.

15:49.082 --> 15:50.550
Welcome to the team.

15:50.550 --> 15:51.584
Wait!
This isn't a uniform.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.186
These are towels.

15:53.186 --> 15:55.188
You're very perceptive,
aren't you?

15:55.188 --> 15:58.091
But aren't I on the team?

15:58.091 --> 15:59.526
Of course
you're on the team.
As a towel girl.

16:00.393 --> 16:01.961
It's an honor.

16:03.063 --> 16:04.631
How is it an honor?

16:04.631 --> 16:06.699
(INCREDULOUS CHUCKLE)

16:06.699 --> 16:10.703
Say there is no towel girl.
Say Greg hoists Tina
up into a cupie,

16:10.703 --> 16:14.774
and there is no one
to towel off
his sweaty hands.

16:14.774 --> 16:18.411
Tina slips.
Tina falls and... and lands
on her spinal cord,

16:18.411 --> 16:21.114
and she spends the rest
of her life doing watercolors
with her teeth.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.018
Do you want
that to happen?

16:25.018 --> 16:26.386
I guess not.

16:26.386 --> 16:27.287
Hmm.

16:29.056 --> 16:30.090
I didn't think so.

16:31.091 --> 16:33.593
(CHATTERING)

Man, these colors
are hype!

I am never
taking this off.

16:48.708 --> 16:51.578
Here's Marni
with some light reading.

16:51.578 --> 16:54.547
Now, study those
rule books and wear
those uniforms with pride.

16:56.216 --> 16:59.119
People
have given their ankles,

16:59.119 --> 17:01.221

17:03.190 --> 17:07.294
in service to those
very uniforms you have
on your taut little bodies.

'Cause from here
on out you must be
the "bomb diggity."

17:11.298 --> 17:14.233
You must eat leaner,
train meaner, jump higher,

yell louder
and out-pep anyone
who stands in your way.

17:18.105 --> 17:21.441
You must brush better,
floss better, lather,
rinse and repeat better...

In other words,
you must be better in
every aspect of your life.

for all that?

Why do you work so much?

20:14.381 --> 20:16.383
I work so much...

20:16.383 --> 20:19.319
because my dad
wouldn't pay my tuition
unless I declared premed.

to be a doctor, so...

to know, Monica.

not a pop-off?

a little individuality.

a cheerleader in college?

25:34.300 --> 25:36.636
Actually, I did.

25:36.636 --> 25:39.872
Ronald Reagan was
also a cheerleader.

of the last 200 years...

25:43.309 --> 25:45.311

Was Ronald Reagan
really one of the top three?

Top 40.
My point is this.

25:49.849 --> 25:52.018
From great cheerleaders
come even greater leaders.

25:53.285 --> 25:55.321
You may be a great
cheerleader, Whittier,

25:55.321 --> 25:56.923

a great leader.

25:56.923 --> 25:58.991
I know,
and I'm really
trying hard.

25:58.991 --> 26:00.092
See these portraits
on the wall?

26:01.961 --> 26:07.166
A 98-year tradition
of cheerleading excellence
at CSC.

26:07.166 --> 26:11.604
Starting back with
the remarkable
Margaret Whiting in 1938.

26:12.371 --> 26:13.773
What's she doing?

26:14.206 --> 26:16.275
An arabesque.

26:16.275 --> 26:18.344
You can't tell
under the hoopskirt.

26:18.344 --> 26:21.681
All the way up to
the fantastic Hammersmith
dynasty of today.

26:22.314 --> 26:23.315
These are your sisters?

26:24.116 --> 26:26.018
Yep.

26:26.018 --> 26:28.587
They're all part
of a grand legacy
with no end in sight.

26:30.056 --> 26:31.724
That last empty frame
right there is reserved...

26:31.724 --> 26:33.760
for the head cheerleader
who will take our place...

26:33.760 --> 26:35.127
our next leader.

26:35.127 --> 26:36.062
Marni.

26:37.296 --> 26:39.131
It could be Marni.
(CHUCKLES)

26:39.131 --> 26:41.133
Or it could be Greg.
Whoo.

26:41.133 --> 26:42.902
Or as I've been
thinking lately,

26:42.902 --> 26:44.370
it could be you.

26:44.370 --> 26:46.005
Yeah, right.

26:46.005 --> 26:46.873
I'm serious, Whittier.

26:48.875 --> 26:50.977
But I completely
messed up in practice.

26:50.977 --> 26:54.647
I thought you
called me in here to
kick me off the team.

26:54.647 --> 26:57.750
Oh, I haven't totally
ruled that out yet.

26:57.750 --> 27:00.820
I don't know.
I just expect more out
of you than the others.

27:00.820 --> 27:02.922
Certainly more than
your friend, Monica.

27:02.922 --> 27:04.891
Monica was just
messing around.

27:04.891 --> 27:06.325
Wait till game day.
She'll be perfect.

27:06.325 --> 27:10.296
Oh, really? She's gonna
be great on game day?
Monica is a sinking ship!

27:10.296 --> 27:13.065
To be a great cheerleader
you have to make sacrifices.

27:13.065 --> 27:14.701
And I suggest
you start with her.

27:16.669 --> 27:18.404
Do you mean not
being friends with her?

27:18.404 --> 27:19.872
'Cause we're roommates.

27:19.872 --> 27:21.407
Listen, sweetie.

27:21.407 --> 27:23.442
Being head cheerleader...

27:23.442 --> 27:27.046
is a privilege you should
very much want.

27:27.046 --> 27:29.181
I mean, (CHUCKLES)

27:29.181 --> 27:32.819
students have posters
of me on their walls.

27:32.819 --> 27:35.287
They pay hundreds
of dollars...

27:35.287 --> 27:38.290
320 to be exact...
just to get my number.

27:38.290 --> 27:40.693
They raffle off the right
to carry my books to class.
(LAUGHS)

27:40.693 --> 27:41.527
(CHUCKLING)
It's so silly.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.364
Foreign exchange students
literally...

27:45.364 --> 27:50.136
beg to do my homework...
straight A's.

27:50.136 --> 27:53.072
All this could be yours.
You could be the greatest
thing on this campus...

27:54.206 --> 27:56.142
the next me.
(CHUCKLES)

27:56.142 --> 27:57.409
Whoa.

27:57.409 --> 28:00.079
But I don't know.

28:00.079 --> 28:02.181
It's all a question
of how bad
you really want it.

28:02.181 --> 28:03.415
I mean, for starters,

28:03.415 --> 28:06.385
you're gonna have
to shine at the home opener
this weekend.

28:06.385 --> 28:08.354
Literally millions
will be watching you.

28:08.354 --> 28:11.257
But most importantly,
I will be watching you.

28:15.094 --> 28:16.395
I'm tired now.

28:26.906 --> 28:29.408
Handing out all those towels
has made my arms feel like
soggy Jell-O.

28:31.410 --> 28:33.279
I'm too tired to point out
how dumb that sounds.

28:33.279 --> 28:34.847
Hey, guys.

28:34.847 --> 28:36.749

28:36.749 --> 28:38.217
(GIGGLES)
Why are you so happy?

28:38.217 --> 28:41.353
Didn't Tina just rip you
a new... I can't say what.

28:41.353 --> 28:45.024
Actually... and, ladies,
please keep this a secret,

28:45.024 --> 28:48.127
Tina told me that
if I work really hard...

28:48.127 --> 28:49.796
and I play my cards right,

28:51.430 --> 28:54.333
I could become
head cheerleader.

28:54.333 --> 28:55.868
Congratulations, Whittier!

28:55.868 --> 28:57.503
Yeah, that's great!

28:57.503 --> 28:59.005
You're not bummed are you?

28:59.005 --> 29:01.407
No. I don't want
to be head cheerleader.

29:01.407 --> 29:05.211
I'm just flossin' my moves
until I make it as a dancer
on J.Lo's next tour.

29:05.211 --> 29:06.913
I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

29:06.913 --> 29:09.248
What?

29:09.248 --> 29:12.151
Tina made a lot of sense
in practice the other day.

29:12.151 --> 29:15.955
There is a big difference
between individual dance moves
and... Oh, my gosh!

29:15.955 --> 29:18.490
What?

29:18.490 --> 29:23.896
There's over 680 calories
in that. Not to mention
35 grams of saturated fat.

29:23.896 --> 29:27.834
That must've been
a real special talk you had
with Tina back there.

29:27.834 --> 29:29.869
Too bad your Jedi
mind tricks couldn't fend off
the dark side of the force.

29:31.804 --> 29:34.473
Monica, if you want to be
the bomb diggity,

29:34.473 --> 29:36.308
you have got to act
like the bomb diggity,

29:36.308 --> 29:37.576
and Tina is
the bomb diggity!

29:41.113 --> 29:43.850
Did she just say,
"bomb diggity" three times
in one sentence?

36:40.632 --> 36:44.570
Well, look who it is,
smart guy.

36:44.570 --> 36:47.773
Why don't you say
something smart,
smart guy?

36:47.773 --> 36:51.977
Yeah, okay.
How about something foreign

Hi, hottie.

37:09.428 --> 37:11.029
I didn't think
you were gonna make it.
Yeah.

37:11.029 --> 37:12.731
How'd you get past
the goon squad?

37:12.731 --> 37:15.033

No, it's okay.
He's with me.
We're together.

37:27.012 --> 37:29.481
Who's he?

37:29.481 --> 37:30.982
This is Derek.
He's a D.J.

37:30.982 --> 37:32.351
(LAUGHS)

37:34.386 --> 37:38.424
There are, like,
10,000 hot varsity
football players inside,

37:38.424 --> 37:40.459
and you're snuggling up
to a D.J.?

37:41.026 --> 37:42.828
How edgy.

37:42.828 --> 37:44.830
What's wrong
with a D.J.?

37:44.830 --> 37:49.568
Honey, oh.
There's a logical order
to the college universe,

37:49.568 --> 37:52.003
and the sooner
you learn it,
the better.

37:52.003 --> 37:54.573
See, way up here
at the top of the ladder
are football players.

37:54.573 --> 37:56.908
Right.
They rule.
Just underneath them...

37:56.908 --> 38:01.947
are basketball players...
smaller biceps
but still desirable.

38:01.947 --> 38:04.816
Then, soccer hunks,
lacrosse studs,

38:04.816 --> 38:08.420

ohh... fraternity keg-masters,

38:08.420 --> 38:10.622

passes, guys with cars
without parking passes...

38:10.622 --> 38:12.458

38:22.468 --> 38:26.372
and then, God,
all the way at the bottom...

38:26.372 --> 38:28.374
are campus D.J.'s.

38:28.374 --> 38:31.042
One spot above
cafeteria workers.

38:31.042 --> 38:33.479
Actually, I work
at the cafeteria too.

38:33.479 --> 38:34.646
Oh, do you?

38:34.646 --> 38:38.083
Tsk. That's hopeless.

38:38.083 --> 38:42.954
Listen, Whit.
Remember our little "discush"
the other day?

38:42.954 --> 38:45.924
You have to decide,
are you with us...

38:45.924 --> 38:47.359
or are you with him?

38:58.637 --> 39:01.540
I'm sorry.

39:01.540 --> 39:04.676

39:11.650 --> 39:13.719
Oh, I get it. Yeah.

39:15.053 --> 39:16.788
Oops.
But... I'll call you!

39:20.926 --> 39:23.429
I can't believe
you just did that!

39:23.429 --> 39:26.898
Oh, she did the right thing.
She stuck with the winners.

39:26.898 --> 39:29.601

you're a winner because
you got a bunch of idiots...

39:42.848 --> 39:44.550
Are you coming?

What's her problem?
MAN: Drama queen.

39:52.658 --> 39:55.427
So Doc says if I sprain
my hip-flexor one more time,
I can kiss my herkie good-bye.

39:56.762 --> 39:58.129
Hey, you guys.
Hey.

39:59.698 --> 40:00.932

Practice has started.

40:14.813 --> 40:18.717
Today we're gonna work
on manners and respect.

40:18.717 --> 40:23.889
Because some of you
don't know how to behave
at a team function.

40:23.889 --> 40:28.159
Some of you
don't show proper manners
to a head cheerleader.

40:28.159 --> 40:31.497
Some of you
don't show respect to
the concept of team unity.

40:31.497 --> 40:32.931
Come on.

To be a real cheerleader...

41:33.124 --> 41:34.626
Tina, give it a rest.

41:34.626 --> 41:35.827
Not now, Greg!

41:35.827 --> 41:36.628
I said give it a rest!

I should... I should...
I should give it a rest.

41:50.175 --> 41:51.643
Whittier,
call out the steps.

41:51.643 --> 41:52.544
What, me?

41:53.712 --> 41:55.947
You heard me.
That's what leaders do.

41:55.947 --> 41:58.116
But Monica...
Call out the steps.

right out of it!

or you're off the team.

42:11.129 --> 42:12.898

42:17.268 --> 42:18.737
I quit too.

42:18.737 --> 42:21.640
That's right.
I quit too.

42:21.640 --> 42:23.675
Greg, you'll lose your
cheerleading scholarship.

42:23.675 --> 42:26.011
That's right!
I'm stayin' here,

42:26.011 --> 42:27.178

of shame.

42:29.881 --> 42:31.049

42:34.319 --> 42:37.789
You can have this back
because it's supposed
to show team spirit.

42:37.789 --> 42:39.124
It's supposed
to make us feel proud,

42:39.124 --> 42:42.193
but I just feel
guilty and stupid!

42:42.193 --> 42:45.030

your skirt and your spankies
and your top.

42:45.030 --> 42:46.164
I'm out of here!

42:53.371 --> 42:55.173

and enjoy the sunshine.

43:55.701 --> 43:57.803
The sun sucks.

43:57.803 --> 43:59.170
Whittier, don't you know
that the sun...

43:59.170 --> 44:01.740
is nature's Prozac?

44:01.740 --> 44:04.409
Do you really think
the sun is gonna make me
feel better...

44:04.409 --> 44:06.912
about giving up
the most important thing
in my life?

44:06.912 --> 44:09.948
No, but I'm out
of real Prozac, so you're
gonna have to deal.

44:09.948 --> 44:12.283
I ruined my career
as a cheerleader.

44:12.283 --> 44:14.319
I ruined
my relationship with Derek.
I could've had a boyfriend.

49:29.734 --> 49:32.670
Today we're starting

on campus.

49:32.670 --> 49:34.172
Why cheerleading,
you say?

49:34.172 --> 49:36.241
Because cheerleading is fun.

49:36.241 --> 49:38.143
And it fosters
school spirit.

49:38.143 --> 49:39.577
And it also keeps you...

49:41.112 --> 49:42.747
physically fit.

49:42.747 --> 49:44.749
So, what do you guys say?
Are you ready to cheer?

49:44.749 --> 49:45.750
Yeah!

49:49.687 --> 49:52.490
Yes?

49:52.490 --> 49:55.660

involve anguish...
as a theme.

about anguish?

50:02.233 --> 50:03.734

That's all right!
That's okay!

addresses the issue
of anguish... kind of.

50:26.724 --> 50:30.628
Because I am the master...
of accents.

50:32.497 --> 50:34.499
No. See, what we do
is cheerleading.

50:34.499 --> 50:36.301

Something Whittier
forgot to tell
you all is...

50:47.712 --> 50:50.581
if we're good,
we can go to nationals.

50:50.581 --> 50:52.650
Now, if we go to nationals,
we could win.

50:54.619 --> 50:57.388
If we win,
we get a check
for $20,000.

you could use
that money...

51:01.559 --> 51:04.229
to rent rehearsal space.

51:04.229 --> 51:07.365
And, Francis,
you could mount up
a production of Godspell

51:07.365 --> 51:09.467
where everyone has
a French accent.

51:09.467 --> 51:11.102

Plus, we're gonna be
a real squad too.

51:13.871 --> 51:15.473
On our squad,
you're gonna be able to do
whatever you want...

51:15.473 --> 51:16.741
do your own thing.

51:16.741 --> 51:19.310
And if we're good,

51:19.310 --> 51:21.546
we can stamp out
the varsity cheerleading
squad once and for all.

51:27.452 --> 51:28.786
Where do we sign up?
Right over there.

51:30.688 --> 51:32.857
Oh, yeah.

have to save me.

they're a real cheer

in the same way that
Joan Rivers has a real face.

59:49.319 --> 59:52.657
They look foolish.
I mean, really.
What do they have?

59:52.657 --> 59:54.058
They have enthusiasm.

59:54.859 --> 59:57.027
So do we!

59:57.027 --> 59:59.396
And they have
the love of the crowd.
Do we?

59:59.396 --> 01:00:01.365
Don't even think
that thought.

01:00:01.365 --> 01:00:03.067
I'm just saying.

01:00:03.067 --> 01:00:04.835
And I'm just saying...
a person goes
against his team,

01:00:04.835 --> 01:00:07.905
and he could lose his
cheerleading scholarship.

01:00:07.905 --> 01:00:09.239
Let's go.
We've got work to do.

01:00:12.076 --> 01:00:13.210

That herkie into a cupie
just before we spread
the rubber with it...

01:00:23.053 --> 01:00:25.790
That was almost as moving
as the helicopter landing
in Miss Saigon.

01:00:25.790 --> 01:00:27.725
Yeah. I... I know.
For a moment there,
at the end,

01:00:27.725 --> 01:00:29.326
Yeah!

01:00:29.326 --> 01:00:32.763
when we won,
I experienced an emotion...

01:00:32.763 --> 01:00:35.733
that I can only describe
as moderate happiness.

01:00:36.901 --> 01:00:38.402
How did you know
where we were gonna be?

01:00:41.806 --> 01:00:43.040
You told him?

01:00:44.308 --> 01:00:46.143
Whittier, zero.
Monica, four.

01:00:47.077 --> 01:00:49.379
Thanks.

01:00:49.379 --> 01:00:53.017
Your, uh, squad... is gonna
have a real tough time
winning nationals...

01:00:53.017 --> 01:00:56.053
when, technically speaking,
you don't exist.

01:00:56.053 --> 01:00:58.355
(SCOFFS) Look around.
I'd say we exist.

01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:02.159
Who are you?

01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:05.462
Shh...
It's called a razor,
scruffy boy.

01:01:05.462 --> 01:01:08.899
You don't exist according
to a little thing called
Section Eight...

01:01:08.899 --> 01:01:12.069
of the National Collegiate
Cheer Association Bylaws.

01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:14.338
Yeah. It states that, um,
each university...

01:01:14.338 --> 01:01:16.941
shall be represented
by one... and only one...

01:01:16.941 --> 01:01:19.343

01:01:22.046 --> 01:01:23.480
You can't do this to us.

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.916
So make like
a Tom and cruise.

01:01:25.916 --> 01:01:28.218
This is modern-day
imperialism.

01:01:28.218 --> 01:01:29.486
Boo freaking hoo.

01:01:29.486 --> 01:01:32.356
Uh, you missed
something, sweetie.

01:01:32.356 --> 01:01:34.725
It does say that only
one team from State can go
to nationals.

01:01:34.725 --> 01:01:36.260
Sí.

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:37.962
But it doesn't say
which team.

01:01:39.363 --> 01:01:40.898
That team could be us.

01:01:41.799 --> 01:01:43.033
(HUFFS)

01:01:45.069 --> 01:01:47.772
Even if all that is true,
it doesn't matter.

01:01:47.772 --> 01:01:49.173
Mm-hmm.

01:01:49.173 --> 01:01:51.842
Varsity has been going
to nationals forever.

01:01:51.842 --> 01:01:53.410
That is not gonna change.

01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:55.746
It just might.

01:01:55.746 --> 01:01:58.749
Looks like we're at
an impasse.

01:01:58.749 --> 01:02:01.085
So how 'bout you and I
just figure this out
right now.

01:02:01.085 --> 01:02:05.923
Where did you get that?
That does not belong
to you.

01:02:05.923 --> 01:02:08.759
Ladies, we are not going
to settle things this way.

01:02:08.759 --> 01:02:11.095
There's only one honest,
impartial person

01:02:11.095 --> 01:02:12.462
on this campus who can
judge who's right.

01:02:12.462 --> 01:02:13.397
(MIMICKING IN FAST VOICE)

01:02:13.397 --> 01:02:16.333
(MOUSY VOICE)

01:02:16.333 --> 01:02:20.204
And while I admire your spunk,
Miss Smith, this is a school
built on tradition.

01:02:20.204 --> 01:02:22.206
But...

01:02:22.206 --> 01:02:23.473
And in this case
tradition favors
Miss Hammersmith.

01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:27.144
I must say, Whittier,

01:02:27.144 --> 01:02:30.547
there's a lot of good,
honest wisdom behind
what the dean has to say.

01:02:30.547 --> 01:02:31.782
Thank you.
You're welcome.

01:02:31.782 --> 01:02:32.817
Sure.

01:02:35.019 --> 01:02:37.922
But what about the rules?
Nowhere in the bylaws
does it say...

01:02:37.922 --> 01:02:40.057
that it has to be
the varsity team
that goes to nationals.

01:02:40.057 --> 01:02:41.458
Why can't it be us?

01:02:41.458 --> 01:02:43.828
Well, sure.
Legally, technically...

01:02:43.828 --> 01:02:46.797
if you... squint
your eyes just right...
the rules say it could be you.

01:02:46.797 --> 01:02:48.532
But we're talking about
seven consecutive years

01:02:48.532 --> 01:02:50.267
of cheerleading
excellence here.

01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:52.102
I'm not gonna
put an end to that.

01:02:54.371 --> 01:02:56.773
Miss Hammersmith
will go to nationals.

01:02:58.976 --> 01:03:02.012
With all due respect,
Dean Sebastian,

01:03:02.012 --> 01:03:05.082
I don't think that's
a decision that will go over
well with the student body.

01:03:05.082 --> 01:03:06.316
How do you mean?

01:03:06.316 --> 01:03:08.986
I mean, if you suppress
our voices on campus,

01:03:08.986 --> 01:03:12.857
you will be hearing from us
in letters to the board
of trustees...

01:03:12.857 --> 01:03:14.524
not to mention
the around-the-clock
protestors

01:03:14.524 --> 01:03:17.094
that will be outside
your door.

01:03:17.094 --> 01:03:20.865
Okay, okay, okay.
We get it.
What the hell do you want?

01:03:20.865 --> 01:03:23.901
A competition in front of
the whole student body.

01:03:23.901 --> 01:03:26.503
Let them
decide who's better,
your team or mine.

01:03:26.503 --> 01:03:28.005
Girl on girl.
Hmm.

01:03:30.507 --> 01:03:32.376

Listen, Whit.

We're good friends, right?

01:03:41.485 --> 01:03:46.023
And as a good friend,
I should caution you that
such a competition...

01:03:46.023 --> 01:03:48.926
could embarrass
you severely.

01:03:48.926 --> 01:03:52.096
It could destroy your
already-fragile psyche.

01:03:53.898 --> 01:03:56.901
Well, that's a risk
I'm willing to take, Tina.

01:03:56.901 --> 01:03:59.069
(GROANS) She can't
do this, can she?

01:03:59.069 --> 01:04:00.837
Actually, Miss Hammersmith,
I think it's a splendid idea.

01:04:02.439 --> 01:04:03.473
We'll have a competition.

01:04:03.473 --> 01:04:05.075
What?

01:04:05.075 --> 01:04:06.610
Thank you.

in the field house...

01:04:08.412 --> 01:04:10.647
this coming Saturday.
What?

01:04:10.647 --> 01:04:12.582

after tomorrow.

excuse me, ladies,
I have a lunch date.

Yes, you will.

be happening.

Oh, yes, it can.

01:04:21.558 --> 01:04:23.493

for the competition.
Good day.

01:04:24.461 --> 01:04:26.530
Ready to back out yet?

01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:29.433
Are you kidding me?
After the way
you treated us?

01:04:29.433 --> 01:04:31.468
You know I used to
look up to you?

01:04:31.468 --> 01:04:33.437
But that was before
I found out who you are.

01:04:33.437 --> 01:04:35.139
An insecure "tanorexic."

01:04:36.573 --> 01:04:39.443
Listen to me,
you hobbit.

01:04:39.443 --> 01:04:41.411
After this idiotic
competition is over,

01:04:41.411 --> 01:04:43.413
you'll be praying
you were me.

01:04:43.413 --> 01:04:46.917
You'll be finished
as a cheerleader
and finished here.

01:04:46.917 --> 01:04:49.987

so far down you'll be
in the cafeteria...

a boyfriend, putting grapes
in the Jell-O molds.

in my Kool-Aid.

showdown in the field house
this Saturday.

Come on, you sissy!

cheer team has been vigorously
training for the event.

01:05:41.171 --> 01:05:44.508
I'm totally not tired.
Why are y'all so tired?

01:05:44.508 --> 01:05:49.479
And State cheerleading legend,
Tina Hammersmith, is confident
about her team's chances.

01:05:49.479 --> 01:05:52.282
This is nothing new to us.
We've defeated
some of the best...

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:55.019
intercollegiate competition
ever assembled.

01:05:55.019 --> 01:05:58.322

is just a speed bump...

01:05:58.322 --> 01:05:59.156

victory on Saturday?

01:06:10.034 --> 01:06:14.038
Oh. It's very important.
It's very important.

01:06:14.038 --> 01:06:16.773
It... It's very important.
This is very, very...

01:06:16.773 --> 01:06:19.176
I... I cannot tell you
how important this is.

01:06:21.445 --> 01:06:24.714
It's a... It's pretty...
pretty important.

01:06:24.714 --> 01:06:27.417
Meanwhile, some people
around campus...

01:06:27.417 --> 01:06:31.588
are starting to dub
the upstart competition as...
the Renegades.

Whittier Smith,

01:06:33.357 --> 01:06:36.026

is ready to go.

We are definitely
going to win.

we've worked extremely hard
and it's gonna be tough, but,

COLLEEN: To train for
the event, the Renegades have
taken an unusual approach,

01:06:54.144 --> 01:06:58.348
cheering for typically
under-appreciated teams
such as the diving team,

01:06:58.348 --> 01:07:01.518
the bowling club
and the fencing squad.

01:07:01.518 --> 01:07:05.089

Stab him. Stab him.
Poke him in the eye.

till his blood runs dry.

En garde!

01:07:11.495 --> 01:07:15.465
Well, some people
look at an impossible
situation and ask why.

01:07:15.465 --> 01:07:18.034
Others look at the same
situation and ask, why not?

For the competition
on Saturday,

01:07:21.338 --> 01:07:24.174
I'm asking myself why.

01:07:24.174 --> 01:07:28.545
Why bother? In a billion years
we'll all be obliterated
by a black hole anyway.

01:07:28.545 --> 01:07:31.415

anybody know we're in here.

Don't leave
any of your stuff.

01:08:02.212 --> 01:08:03.413
All right.

01:08:04.214 --> 01:08:05.882
Think we're ready?

01:08:05.882 --> 01:08:09.419
Well, no one fell tonight.
I'm pretty happy about that.

01:08:09.419 --> 01:08:10.787
Um, Whittier,
can I talk to you alone?

01:08:10.787 --> 01:08:12.422
Yeah. Francis, what's up?

01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:15.259
Uh, I'm gonna
level with you.

01:08:15.259 --> 01:08:18.194
I'm getting very nervous
about tomorrow. Okay?

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:21.165
And I'm thinking about
violating myself tonight.

01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:25.469
It's an actor
relaxation technique.

01:08:25.469 --> 01:08:27.770
What I need to know
from you is what does
Whittier think?

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:29.506
Is that a bad idea, or...

Your routine was good.

01:23:34.743 --> 01:23:37.413

a tad pedestrian
at times, but good.

You're our new varsity
cheerleading squad.

It'll be a thrill
to work with the new...
bomb diggity.

01:23:55.298 --> 01:23:57.633

excuse me, ladies,
I have a lunch date.

01:24:01.837 --> 01:24:04.707

Really? Wait. Wait.

01:24:08.811 --> 01:24:10.579
You and me
on the same team?

01:24:10.579 --> 01:24:13.249
Of course, you'd have
to audition first.

01:24:13.249 --> 01:24:14.483
I don't audition.

01:24:15.551 --> 01:24:16.519

But maybe I can come
help you out, you know.

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:26.695
I'll have to
check my "sched."
I could bring Marni.

01:24:26.695 --> 01:24:29.432
(SQUEALS)
Or not. I never even
really liked her anyways.

01:24:29.432 --> 01:24:31.400
It's just,
I was thinking Friday

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:34.103
we could get some "fro-yo,"
do some choreography.

01:24:34.103 --> 01:24:36.439
You know, you guys.

01:24:36.439 --> 01:24:39.408

That's okay
Let's see how you do it

01:25:00.863 --> 01:25:04.367
