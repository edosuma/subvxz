00:40.488 --> 00:42.388
This is Lindsey.

00:42.390 --> 00:44.424
Lindsey Lewis.

00:44.426 --> 00:46.892
My sister and our friends,
they're all...

00:46.894 --> 00:50.998
If you find this, uh, could you
please give it to my family

00:51.000 --> 00:52.701
and tell them...

02:04.773 --> 02:07.473
As the young woman
stares into the horizon,

02:07.475 --> 02:10.477
she yearns
for adventures yet to be had,

02:10.479 --> 02:14.480
worlds to behold
and dreams to fulfill.

02:14.482 --> 02:16.349
She wonders to herself

02:16.351 --> 02:18.384
what remarkable journey awaits

02:18.386 --> 02:22.422
with her incredibly beautiful,
remarkably bold

02:22.424 --> 02:27.460
and fantastically-intelligent
older sister at the helm...

02:27.462 --> 02:28.929
Cut! Ugh!

02:28.931 --> 02:30.964
Lindz, that was so good
I was gonna keep going.

02:30.966 --> 02:32.566
Real smooth, Lindz.

02:32.568 --> 02:34.567
Yeah. 2003 R&B smooth.

02:34.569 --> 02:37.137
- R&B in 2003 sucked.
- E-exactly.

02:37.139 --> 02:40.473
I'm sorry. I tried to hold it,
but you were killing me.

02:40.475 --> 02:42.709
Fine. We got something
to work with.

02:42.711 --> 02:44.377
- You wanna try it again?
- Nah. It's whatevs.

02:44.379 --> 02:45.679
We got it. Right, Evan?

02:45.681 --> 02:47.480
Yeah, we got a lot.
We got a lot. Huh.

02:47.482 --> 02:50.952
- Moving on to <i>the plane!</i>
- Yeah.

02:52.754 --> 02:55.422
Wait. That's the plane?

02:55.424 --> 02:57.156
It's pretty small,
don't you think?

02:57.158 --> 02:58.991
I mean, is our stuff
even gonna fit in there?

02:58.993 --> 03:01.995
It's the only privately-owned
float plane on the island.

03:01.997 --> 03:05.065
What's the matter? I thought you
always wanted to fly private.

03:05.067 --> 03:07.734
Well, you know
I'm claustrophobic.

03:07.736 --> 03:09.703
And that's a teeny-tiny plane.

03:09.705 --> 03:11.638
Uh, I mean,
it, it got itself here, right?

03:11.640 --> 03:13.973
- So it should be fine.
- Right, right.

03:13.975 --> 03:17.543
It'll be fine. Always is.

03:17.545 --> 03:20.579
You know we will have no
transponder, yes? I turn it off.

03:20.581 --> 03:23.449
Totes. That's how we roll,
off the grid.

03:23.451 --> 03:25.050
You know, this place,
it's very dangerous.

03:25.052 --> 03:27.120
It's closed to the public
for good reason.

03:27.122 --> 03:28.754
Look, we don't get
our subscribers

03:28.756 --> 03:31.157
by doing cooking shows.
You know what I'm sayin'?

03:31.159 --> 03:34.494
Hector, come on, we got this!
Don't worry!

03:34.496 --> 03:36.029
It's Javier.

03:36.031 --> 03:38.698
Javie... Javier, right!

03:38.700 --> 03:41.501
Oh, my God, I am so sorry.
That was really terrible of me.

03:41.503 --> 03:43.736
I actually feel really bad.

03:43.738 --> 03:44.940
Are we good?

03:46.575 --> 03:48.073
Okay.

03:48.075 --> 03:50.445
All right, it's a go!
Let's load the plane!

03:52.014 --> 03:54.014
- So we all good?
- Flying under the radar, girl.

03:54.016 --> 03:56.049
- Transponder off.
- Oh! Hell, yeah!

03:56.051 --> 03:57.851
That's how we do it.

03:57.853 --> 03:59.652
What do you mean,
"Under the radar?"

03:59.654 --> 04:01.922
Don't worry your little mind.
Everything is perfect.

04:01.924 --> 04:05.525
Yeah, everything is perfect,
except your worrying, so stop.

04:05.527 --> 04:06.729
We got this.

04:15.537 --> 04:19.005
Hey. Worried about the dive,
aren't you?

04:19.007 --> 04:21.072
Are you sure about this?

04:21.075 --> 04:22.975
Yeah, we've been plannin' it
for months.

04:22.977 --> 04:25.611
And everything we do
is a little dangerous.

04:25.613 --> 04:27.112
You're starting to sound
like Paige.

04:27.114 --> 04:28.748
And you're starting to sound
like you don't trust me.

04:28.750 --> 04:30.150
No, no, I do, I just...

04:30.152 --> 04:31.951
So if Seb's serious, I guess

04:31.953 --> 04:33.953
Lindsey's gonna be
stickin' around a while, huh?

04:33.955 --> 04:36.556
Even if she is whinin'
the whole time.

04:36.558 --> 04:38.724
Yeah. Looks like
Lindsey's part of the team.

04:38.726 --> 04:40.826
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
she cramps our style.

04:40.828 --> 04:42.828
Oh, yeah, no doubt.

04:42.830 --> 04:46.732
But we have so much overflow
on sick style,

04:46.734 --> 04:50.135
we can afford to spare some.
You know, share the swag.

04:51.573 --> 04:53.707
- Yeah, swag.
- Yeah.

04:53.709 --> 04:55.241
To know me is to love me.

04:55.243 --> 04:58.979
Uh, I think you're
more of an acquired taste.

04:58.981 --> 05:01.147
Ooh! Ooh!

05:01.149 --> 05:03.049
So, um, in all seriousness now,

05:03.051 --> 05:05.585
um, the plane,

05:05.587 --> 05:06.953
you know, off the radar...

05:06.955 --> 05:08.854
If something goes down,
are we gonna be okay?

05:08.856 --> 05:11.624
Oh, my God. Buck up.

05:11.626 --> 05:14.094
All right, fair enough.
Fair enough. Let's do that.

05:14.096 --> 05:16.962
Let's go, my friends!

05:16.964 --> 05:18.797
I guess
we're doin' this.

05:18.799 --> 05:21.001
- Oh! That's the spirit.
- That's good.

05:21.003 --> 05:23.270
And it's not like
we're flying into a war zone.

05:23.272 --> 05:25.871
That's next time, hah!

05:25.873 --> 05:27.142
Let's do this.

05:32.548 --> 05:34.246
- Hey.
- What's up, Evan?

05:34.248 --> 05:36.248
Um, not much. How about you?

05:36.250 --> 05:39.852
You pumped? You, uh,
ready to make this happen?

05:39.854 --> 05:42.556
Hey, hey, hey, knock it off,
all right?

05:42.558 --> 05:44.691
If you ruin this for me,
I will ruin you.

05:44.693 --> 05:46.562
- You got that?
- Ah, you good, bro.

06:19.727 --> 06:21.061
All right.

06:21.063 --> 06:22.761
Red Rock Cove
was once known as

06:22.763 --> 06:24.731
<i>the</i> spot to dive
in Southeast Asia,

06:24.733 --> 06:28.734
but it all ended when it was
declared a protected sanctuary.

06:28.736 --> 06:30.936
But today we get a chance

06:30.938 --> 06:33.039
to take you inside
this incredible place

06:33.041 --> 06:34.907
for the dive of a lifetime.

06:34.909 --> 06:37.109
Are you ready?

06:37.111 --> 06:38.878
Whoo! Come on!

06:38.880 --> 06:41.648
And cut! Perf-alert!
Nice one, Paige!

06:41.650 --> 06:43.984
That's how we give our viewers
what they really want.

06:43.986 --> 06:47.052
- Adventure content.
- Be nice, Paige.

06:47.054 --> 06:48.989
Oh. What? She's right.

06:48.991 --> 06:50.957
It's about time we got back
to givin' our viewers

06:50.959 --> 06:52.292
what they really wanna see.

06:52.294 --> 06:53.893
Yeah, exactly, I feel like

06:53.895 --> 06:55.328
for a while there, uh,

06:55.330 --> 06:57.931
you were previously engaged
with other things.

07:06.907 --> 07:09.044
Hold in tight.
We're almost there!

07:15.183 --> 07:16.849
Is that the cove right there?

07:16.851 --> 07:19.119
Yeah, that's it!

07:19.121 --> 07:21.153
Hey, I think
I see a shark down there.

07:21.155 --> 07:23.158
- Sweet!
- Cut it out, Evan.

07:25.126 --> 07:27.794
I'm going
to take her down nice and easy.

07:30.164 --> 07:32.232
- Oh, my God!
- Hold on!

07:32.234 --> 07:33.799
We've been in worse than this
before.

07:33.801 --> 07:35.234
- Right, guys?
- Yeah, we're gonna be fine!

07:35.236 --> 07:37.606
Just hold on to the seat
in front of you!

07:48.150 --> 07:49.885
Hold on to something!

08:01.363 --> 08:03.265
Brace for impact!

08:10.072 --> 08:12.141
Hold on to something!

08:42.736 --> 08:45.040
Uh, Paige?

08:48.510 --> 08:50.980
Seb!

08:53.749 --> 08:55.084
Anybody?

08:58.086 --> 08:59.188
Oh, God.

09:35.890 --> 09:37.459
Oh, my God!

09:53.040 --> 09:55.874
Wakey-wakey!

09:55.876 --> 09:58.478
- You scared me.
- Are you ready to meet the team?

09:58.480 --> 10:00.046
Are you ready to join

10:00.048 --> 10:02.215
our crazy band
of adventure seekers?

10:02.217 --> 10:04.551
- Now you're scaring me.
- Oh, come on, relax.

10:04.553 --> 10:06.820
- They're gonna love you.
- That's easy for you to say.

10:06.822 --> 10:08.588
You're, like,
the travel-vlog queen.

10:08.590 --> 10:10.956
Relax, just be yourself.

10:10.958 --> 10:12.325
I was having
a really weird dream.

10:12.327 --> 10:15.231
Mm, well, it's over now.

10:16.331 --> 10:17.533
Come on, Lindz.

10:20.935 --> 10:22.170
Lindz!

10:23.270 --> 10:24.472
Lindz!

10:25.506 --> 10:26.808
Lindz!

10:31.246 --> 10:32.948
Kahaia!

10:34.149 --> 10:36.385
Kahaia. Kahaia!

10:38.319 --> 10:40.220
There.

10:40.222 --> 10:41.323
Oh, shit.

10:43.024 --> 10:44.891
Oh, my God, you're hurt.

10:44.893 --> 10:47.359
No. I'm-I'm fine.

10:47.361 --> 10:50.231
I think I saw a fin, though.
Maybe it's a dolphin.

10:51.399 --> 10:53.465
Uh, where is everybody?

10:53.467 --> 10:54.968
I don't know.

10:54.970 --> 10:56.536
Wait, a fin?

10:56.538 --> 10:58.841
Yeah, but it's probably
just a dolphin, right?

11:00.942 --> 11:03.042
Who knows? Let's hope.

11:03.044 --> 11:04.576
- I'm okay, Lindz!
- Oh.

11:04.578 --> 11:06.912
Seb. Oh. Seb!

11:09.250 --> 11:11.086
Oh, my God! Seb!

11:13.355 --> 11:14.888
I'm okay. I'm all right.

11:17.424 --> 11:19.124
Oh, thank God.

11:22.230 --> 11:23.897
- We're lucky to be alive.
- Yeah.

11:23.899 --> 11:26.199
Damn straight.

11:26.201 --> 11:28.433
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, did you see Paige?

11:28.435 --> 11:32.171
Or Evan? Hey, if we made it,
they must have.

11:32.173 --> 11:33.505
Yeah, I-I don't know
the likelihood

11:33.507 --> 11:35.441
that we all survived
a plane crash.

11:35.443 --> 11:37.277
Hey-hey, we'll-we'll
find them, Lindz, okay?

11:37.279 --> 11:39.144
- Okay.
- Th-they fell out of the plane.

11:39.146 --> 11:42.047
Uh, the wing broke off
and I think it sucked them out.

11:42.049 --> 11:44.117
- Oh, God...
- We don't, we don't know that.

11:44.119 --> 11:46.485
- No, I saw it, man!
- Chill out, Kahaia.

11:46.487 --> 11:48.553
We don't know anything yet.

11:48.555 --> 11:50.525
You're right.
All right, we-we don't know.

11:51.525 --> 11:53.426
Did anybody see the fin?

11:53.428 --> 11:55.295
Don't even talk about that
right now.

11:55.297 --> 11:57.596
Well, then,
where's Evan and Paige?

11:57.598 --> 11:59.565
Oh, God, where are they?

11:59.567 --> 12:02.000
No, we need to find them.
We need to stay together!

12:02.002 --> 12:04.269
- No, no, Lindz.
- Lindz. Hey, Lindz.

12:04.271 --> 12:06.571
- Lindsey, stop! Lindsey, stop!
- Stop! Stop!

12:06.573 --> 12:09.008
I'm sure she's gonna be okay,
all right?

12:09.010 --> 12:12.110
We fell out over open water,
so they could be fine.

12:12.112 --> 12:13.245
- All right?
- It's okay.

12:13.247 --> 12:14.647
It's possible. Tell her, Kahaia.

12:14.649 --> 12:17.316
Uh, we-well, w-we survived, so...

12:17.318 --> 12:19.551
An-an-and Red Rock Cove's
only a couple miles out.

12:19.553 --> 12:20.954
So they're probably there.

12:20.956 --> 12:23.089
Well, then,
we should go find them.

12:23.091 --> 12:25.224
Look, we will, okay,
but right now

12:25.226 --> 12:27.292
we need to focus
on staying alive.

12:27.294 --> 12:28.961
We need to conserve our energy.

12:28.963 --> 12:30.562
You guys,
we're in real trouble here.

12:30.564 --> 12:32.934
Hey. Hey, hey, hey! Look, look!

12:35.236 --> 12:37.005
- Oh!
- Oh!

12:47.448 --> 12:49.315
He's bleeding pretty bad.

12:49.317 --> 12:52.085
He deserves it. This damn fool
almost got us killed.

12:52.087 --> 12:53.452
You're not helping, Kahaia.

12:53.454 --> 12:56.388
Hey-hey, stay with us.
It's gonna be okay.

12:56.390 --> 12:58.157
- Lindz...
- No, it's gonna be all right...

12:58.159 --> 12:59.492
Help is coming.

12:59.494 --> 13:01.297
- Nobody coming.
- What?

13:02.630 --> 13:05.998
The transponder off.
Nobody knows.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.033
- Oh, my God. He's right.
- Wait, what?

13:08.035 --> 13:10.769
We turned off the locator
so we wouldn't get detected.

13:10.771 --> 13:13.672
The tail. ELT.

13:13.674 --> 13:15.176
ELT what?

13:16.177 --> 13:18.948
Locator. Switch on.

13:32.327 --> 13:34.527
It's gotta be under us.

13:42.202 --> 13:44.771
No, no, no, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, stay with us.

13:44.773 --> 13:46.207
Help will come.

14:07.761 --> 14:09.263
No rescue.

14:10.331 --> 14:14.499
Supplies... in cove...

14:14.501 --> 14:17.472
Supplies? What? In what cove?

14:18.439 --> 14:21.673
Oh, God. No, stay with me.

14:21.675 --> 14:23.044
No.

14:23.778 --> 14:25.247
Please.

14:31.852 --> 14:35.491
I found the tail!
It's about twenty feet below us!

14:41.496 --> 14:43.528
I also found this.

15:18.299 --> 15:19.434
Get in.

15:30.245 --> 15:32.614
This will keep us anchored until
we can activate the locator.

15:38.852 --> 15:42.256
Where's the pilot?
Where's the pilot, Lindsey?

15:45.693 --> 15:48.429
I don't know. Where's Seb?

15:54.334 --> 15:55.536
Seb!

15:57.204 --> 15:58.937
You two stay put.

15:58.939 --> 16:00.806
I'm gonna swim out
to the island. He said supplies.

16:00.808 --> 16:02.742
There could be a radio,
I could signal for help.

16:02.744 --> 16:03.812
Seb!

16:04.779 --> 16:06.481
No! Seb, wait!

16:07.615 --> 16:09.717
Seb!

16:12.786 --> 16:16.190
Lindz. Wait!

16:18.259 --> 16:19.561
Seb!

16:21.696 --> 16:23.896
- Lindsey, what are you doing?
- Seb!

16:23.898 --> 16:27.200
I-I thought we said
we were gonna stay together!

16:27.202 --> 16:29.569
- Lindsey, go back!
- Seb!

16:29.571 --> 16:32.404
Lindz, what the hell are you
doing? Get back to the raft.

16:32.406 --> 16:33.973
Kahaia's right,
we need to stay together.

16:33.975 --> 16:35.340
I will be right back, okay?

16:35.342 --> 16:36.709
You'll be safe here with her.

16:36.711 --> 16:38.411
Only one of us
needs to go to the cove.

16:38.413 --> 16:40.446
If I can find a radio,
I can signal for help.

16:40.448 --> 16:42.415
No, it doesn't make sense
for you to be by yourself.

16:42.417 --> 16:45.850
- I will be back, I promise.
- No, you need to stay with me.

16:45.852 --> 16:47.920
I need you to be with me.

16:47.922 --> 16:50.255
Lindsey, listen to me.

16:50.257 --> 16:52.425
I will be right back, okay?

16:52.427 --> 16:54.663
But right now
I gotta do this, okay?

16:55.663 --> 16:57.763
I gotta save Paige.

16:57.765 --> 16:59.764
And Evan, all right?
And all of us...

16:59.766 --> 17:01.801
I'm...
I'll be back, I promise.

17:04.471 --> 17:07.275
You, you guys,
get back to the raft.

17:11.512 --> 17:13.945
Oh, my God,
that's not a dolphin.

17:13.948 --> 17:14.981
Oh.

17:14.983 --> 17:17.515
- No.
- Seb!

17:18.652 --> 17:20.386
Get back to the raft!

17:20.387 --> 17:22.753
Lindsey, swim!

17:22.756 --> 17:23.954
Seb!

17:26.660 --> 17:28.394
Lindsey! Ah!

17:28.396 --> 17:30.428
- Lindsey!
- No!

17:30.430 --> 17:31.566
Swim!

17:35.370 --> 17:36.735
The world is waiting.

17:36.737 --> 17:38.937
And if you want it bad enough,
it can be yours.

17:38.939 --> 17:40.639
It is there
and it is more amazing

17:40.641 --> 17:42.407
than you can ever imagine.

17:42.409 --> 17:45.578
I'm Paige Lewis,
and this silly couple behind me

17:45.580 --> 17:46.978
is my little sister, Lindsey,

17:46.980 --> 17:49.648
and her now BF, Seb.

17:49.650 --> 17:51.449
Bet you saw that one coming.

17:51.451 --> 17:52.984
And if you're
into seeing the world,

17:52.986 --> 17:55.487
join me and my like-minded
band of adventure seekers

17:55.489 --> 17:57.590
as we travel
in search of new thrills

17:57.592 --> 17:59.425
and adventures, this is...

17:59.427 --> 18:00.792
<i>The Lit Life!</i>

18:02.830 --> 18:05.898
And cut! Sweet!

18:05.900 --> 18:08.600
Oh, and you two are so cute!
I could just eat you up.

18:08.602 --> 18:10.839
All right. Let's pack up and
get ready for tomorrow, guys.

18:13.474 --> 18:15.940
Hm. I'm gonna go
take a shower, sweetie.

18:15.942 --> 18:18.410
All right, I'll meet you
in a few. I'm gonna go work out.

18:18.412 --> 18:20.513
You don't need to work out.
You're perfect the way you are.

18:20.515 --> 18:22.514
I absolutely am not.

18:22.516 --> 18:24.753
- So I'm gonna go work out.
- Okay.

18:31.793 --> 18:32.957
- Hey, Seb.
- Hey.

18:32.959 --> 18:34.060
Huh, going to the gym?

18:34.062 --> 18:35.597
Just for a bit.

18:37.832 --> 18:39.967
Okay, good chat.
I'll see you later, Paige.

18:41.468 --> 18:42.938
Are you gonna tell her?

18:46.073 --> 18:48.009
Paige, there's nothing to tell.

18:55.350 --> 18:57.382
Hey, Lindz,
check out this dope drone shot

18:57.384 --> 18:58.951
I got of the ocean earlier.

19:11.666 --> 19:15.070
Lindsey, get back here!

19:21.909 --> 19:23.844
Get back to the raft!

19:30.717 --> 19:33.017
Swim! Goddammit, swim!

19:33.019 --> 19:34.755
Lindsey, move!

19:36.657 --> 19:39.093
Swim! Goddammit, swim!

19:40.428 --> 19:41.963
Get back here!

19:44.399 --> 19:47.099
- Kahaia!
- Lindsey, come on! Swim!

19:47.101 --> 19:50.903
Swim! Swim, goddammit!
Swim faster!

19:50.905 --> 19:53.638
Faster, Lindsey.
You can make it!

19:53.640 --> 19:56.108
- Come on, come on. Move it.
- Yeah.

19:56.110 --> 19:58.610
Hurry, Lindsey, hurry!

19:58.612 --> 20:00.111
Lindsey, hurry up!

20:00.113 --> 20:02.580
Lindsey, swim. Hurry!

20:02.582 --> 20:05.583
Come on, that's it. Swim.

20:05.585 --> 20:08.920
No, no, no, you're not tired.
Come on! Move!

20:08.922 --> 20:10.925
Lindsey, you're almost here,
you're almost here.

20:11.926 --> 20:15.160
Lindz. Reach out. Reach out.

20:15.162 --> 20:16.698
Oh, God.

20:19.534 --> 20:21.833
Where are they?

20:21.835 --> 20:23.903
They're everywhere,
they're closing.

20:23.905 --> 20:25.571
Lindsey, get outta there!

20:25.573 --> 20:27.473
Distance, how far?

20:27.475 --> 20:29.608
- Jesus, Lindsey! Swim!
- How far?

20:29.610 --> 20:31.446
Twenty feet.

20:32.947 --> 20:34.515
Fifteen.

20:35.749 --> 20:37.683
- Three...
- Shit, Lindsey!

20:37.685 --> 20:39.688
- What the hell are you doing?
- Two...

20:40.621 --> 20:42.687
One.

20:42.689 --> 20:43.824
Lindz!

20:48.196 --> 20:49.930
Lindsey!

21:07.881 --> 21:09.918
Oh, my God.

21:12.018 --> 21:13.688
Get on... Swim!

21:16.756 --> 21:20.027
Get over here! Come on.
Come on, Lindsey, you can do it.

21:22.129 --> 21:25.033
Swim, Lindsey! Move!
Quick, quick!

21:26.934 --> 21:28.967
Oh, God!

21:28.969 --> 21:31.072
No! No! Lindsey!

21:42.516 --> 21:44.686
- That was...
- Really lucky?

21:46.653 --> 21:48.821
That about covers it.

21:48.823 --> 21:50.559
Are you okay?

21:54.294 --> 21:56.564
Oh, shit.

22:02.236 --> 22:05.841
I'm so sorry, Lindz.
I'm so sorry.

22:26.561 --> 22:28.026
<i>You guys...</i>

22:28.028 --> 22:29.928
This is my sister, Lindsey!

22:29.930 --> 22:31.996
- Hey, how's it goin'?
- Oh. Whaddup, girl?

22:31.998 --> 22:33.866
- Hi.
- Evan, get this.

22:33.868 --> 22:35.801
Yes, ma'am.

22:35.803 --> 22:38.236
What are you most excited about
joining the team?

22:38.238 --> 22:41.907
Well,
I really wanna travel the world.

22:41.909 --> 22:43.676
- Where do you wanna go?
- Yeah, like, one place.

22:43.678 --> 22:46.078
- Your dream spot.
- Ooh!

22:46.080 --> 22:48.112
- Refreshments!
- Whoo!

22:48.114 --> 22:51.583
- Ohh!
- For you...

22:51.585 --> 22:53.051
- For you.
- Thank you.

22:53.053 --> 22:54.986
- And you.
- Thank you.

22:54.988 --> 22:56.155
Come to mama, I want her.

22:56.157 --> 22:57.356
Oh, you want a little pineapple.

22:57.358 --> 22:59.891
- Don't you, Kahaia?
- That's the one.

22:59.893 --> 23:02.093
Courtesy of our sponsors
over at Aqua Blue Dive Gear.

23:02.095 --> 23:03.928
- Thank you.
- You got it.

23:03.930 --> 23:05.363
- Let's cheers!
- Oh, all right.

23:05.365 --> 23:06.732
To Lindsey

23:06.734 --> 23:09.001
joining, uh, <i>The Lit Life.</i>

23:09.003 --> 23:10.769
<i>The Lit Life.</i>

23:12.206 --> 23:15.206
- To Lindsey.
- Welcome.

23:15.208 --> 23:17.609
I've always dreamed
about diving with the sharks.

23:17.611 --> 23:18.977
Somewhere
in The Great Barrier Reef.

23:18.979 --> 23:20.779
You know, I know just the place.

23:20.781 --> 23:22.715
- You've done it?
- Twice.

23:22.717 --> 23:24.849
But I don't think
the sharks remembered me.

23:24.851 --> 23:26.784
Mm, they'd remember you.

23:26.786 --> 23:30.155
Shark diving? Lame!

23:30.157 --> 23:32.159
Almost as lame as storm chasing.

23:40.167 --> 23:43.034
We, we can't stay here.

23:43.036 --> 23:45.704
If that pilot was right,
no one will find us.

23:45.706 --> 23:48.807
Maybe, maybe a boat will come.

23:48.809 --> 23:50.743
I wouldn't count on it.

23:50.745 --> 23:51.947
Why not?

23:53.880 --> 23:57.215
- You shouldn't even be here.
- What the hell does that mean?

23:57.217 --> 24:00.351
It means, you weren't supposed
to be in this group.

24:00.353 --> 24:03.856
Jesus. You and Seb
were click bait, that's it.

24:03.858 --> 24:07.158
You don't add anything
to this equation.

24:07.160 --> 24:10.198
- You worry. You're scared.
- You're not scared?

24:13.133 --> 24:14.867
Maybe you're right.

24:14.869 --> 24:17.703
I'm not some hard-ass ex-Marine.

24:17.705 --> 24:20.238
- Army.
- Whatever.

24:20.240 --> 24:23.074
Trust me,
my two tours in the desert

24:23.076 --> 24:25.843
ain't gonna help us out
much here.

24:25.845 --> 24:29.848
Sometimes you just end up
up a creek with no way out.

24:29.850 --> 24:31.919
I was on borrowed time, anyway.

24:36.323 --> 24:39.194
E.F. Clark? Who's that.

24:41.696 --> 24:45.699
It's... Private first class,
Emmett Clark.

24:47.101 --> 24:48.803
I was on my second tour.

24:50.071 --> 24:52.870
Fifteen miles
outside of Kandahar.

24:52.872 --> 24:56.844
And we were pinned down
for over 26 hours.

24:58.446 --> 25:00.348
Around hour eleven, I gave up.

25:01.348 --> 25:03.782
We weren't makin' it out.

25:03.784 --> 25:05.783
I knew it.

25:07.755 --> 25:09.253
We were wounded,
but a couple of us

25:09.255 --> 25:11.356
were worse than the others.

25:11.358 --> 25:15.263
Private Clark was bleeding out.
He knew he was done.

25:17.098 --> 25:18.332
He was scared.

25:20.133 --> 25:21.201
We all were.

25:23.137 --> 25:25.907
So he grabbed my hand
and he, he put something in it.

25:27.307 --> 25:29.407
And it was his dog tags.

25:29.409 --> 25:31.976
And I asked him who
I was supposed to give 'em to

25:31.978 --> 25:34.882
because I knew
he didn't have any family.

25:36.117 --> 25:38.216
And he said,

25:38.218 --> 25:40.886
"When you make it out,

25:40.888 --> 25:43.358
bring me along
and take me with you."

25:46.127 --> 25:47.892
And I'm looking around,
and it's-it's bullets

25:47.894 --> 25:50.161
just whizzing past,
there's no help in sight,

25:50.163 --> 25:52.497
but somehow,

25:52.499 --> 25:55.335
this goddamn kid knew
I was gonna make it out.

25:59.073 --> 26:02.776
So the next mornin',
AC-130 swoops in...

26:03.843 --> 26:05.880
just tears the place to pieces.

26:07.113 --> 26:09.350
We were evac-ed
a couple of hours later.

26:11.384 --> 26:13.487
So I, I hold on to this.

26:15.322 --> 26:17.891
It helps me remember
that no matter what happens...

26:18.926 --> 26:20.294
life goes on.

26:21.861 --> 26:24.530
So you just don't ever give up.

26:24.532 --> 26:25.800
Ever.

26:28.201 --> 26:31.939
Careful. You're starting
to sound optimistic.

26:34.975 --> 26:36.778
Screw you, click bait.

26:45.953 --> 26:49.253
We need to get to that cove
for the supplies.

26:49.255 --> 26:51.290
No, no, Lindsey. It's too far.

26:51.292 --> 26:54.259
Well, we have this raft.
We can paddle there.

26:54.261 --> 26:56.962
No, look, okay, our,
our best chance to survive is

26:56.964 --> 26:58.964
we need to get down and we need
to activate the beacon.

26:58.966 --> 27:00.131
Look, the sharks will be back.

27:00.133 --> 27:01.835
We won't make it
through the night.

27:03.403 --> 27:05.102
Okay, one hour.

27:05.104 --> 27:07.174
If the beacon doesn't work,
we head for the cove.

27:08.409 --> 27:10.442
All right, we need,
uh, a regulator

27:10.444 --> 27:12.113
and an oxygen tank.

27:17.985 --> 27:21.153
We saw some of our gear
floating around.

27:42.409 --> 27:45.444
- Drink this.
- Shouldn't we ration it?

27:45.446 --> 27:47.015
It's not enough to ration.

27:59.293 --> 28:01.493
Just be careful.

28:01.495 --> 28:03.531
Careful!

28:04.531 --> 28:06.568
Okay. Sorry.

28:08.168 --> 28:10.170
It's okay,
I got freaked out, too.

28:16.377 --> 28:18.046
You mind if I borrow that?

28:30.024 --> 28:31.924
You should've been
on that survival show.

28:31.926 --> 28:34.529
I tried. They said
I wasn't tough enough.

28:39.300 --> 28:41.565
I was wrong about you.

28:41.567 --> 28:43.070
Most people are.

28:43.970 --> 28:45.073
Here.

28:47.041 --> 28:49.177
Right.
We need a rudder to steer.

28:56.717 --> 28:58.986
- No!
- Ah!

29:01.255 --> 29:02.523
You okay?

29:04.324 --> 29:05.592
What do we do?

29:09.063 --> 29:11.565
And that was only one of them.
There was, uh, at least three.

29:12.533 --> 29:13.631
Oh, crap.

29:15.669 --> 29:17.735
Hang on!

29:23.509 --> 29:26.244
- Grab this.
- Yeah.

29:26.246 --> 29:28.146
Go for their eyes.
Also, their gills.

29:28.148 --> 29:30.451
It's their nerve center.
It's the easiest way...

29:32.319 --> 29:33.588
Kahaia?

29:34.988 --> 29:36.924
Oh, God!

29:38.559 --> 29:41.025
- Oh, Lindsey!
- No! Kahaia!

29:41.027 --> 29:43.264
- Back to the raft!
- Ah!

29:55.042 --> 29:56.077
Ah!

30:12.325 --> 30:15.092
Hey, remember when I taught you
how to ride a motorcycle?

30:15.094 --> 30:17.195
You were so scared
you were gonna crash.

30:17.197 --> 30:18.597
But I had faith in you

30:18.599 --> 30:20.968
and I jumped on the back
without a helmet.

30:22.201 --> 30:23.301
When we came to that first turn,

30:23.303 --> 30:24.336
your hand started wobbling,

30:24.338 --> 30:25.803
you didn't know what to do.

30:25.805 --> 30:28.040
So I said, "Just lean.

30:28.042 --> 30:31.676
Don't worry about
the handlebars, just lean."

30:31.678 --> 30:34.245
And you froze
and we almost hit a tree,

30:34.247 --> 30:37.749
but then what did you do?

30:37.751 --> 30:39.051
I leaned.

30:39.053 --> 30:41.052
That's right. You leaned.

30:41.054 --> 30:42.590
And everything was okay.

30:46.092 --> 30:47.428
You got this.

31:14.455 --> 31:17.089
Hey!

31:17.091 --> 31:19.694
Help me.

31:20.660 --> 31:22.226
Help me!

31:22.228 --> 31:24.329
Help!

31:24.331 --> 31:26.134
Help me!

31:27.767 --> 31:30.468
No. Wait!

31:30.470 --> 31:32.339
Help me!

31:33.372 --> 31:35.043
Hey!

31:36.642 --> 31:38.746
No. No. Yeah.

31:44.784 --> 31:47.088
What are you doing?
Oh, you bastard.

33:09.570 --> 33:10.936
You got this.

33:10.938 --> 33:13.507
Just turn on the beacon.
In and out quick.

33:18.611 --> 33:19.813
Ah!

33:20.813 --> 33:22.680
No, I can't do it. I can't.

33:22.682 --> 33:24.551
I can't. I can't.

33:27.420 --> 33:29.590
I can't.

33:32.626 --> 33:35.827
You look nervous. You nervous?

33:35.829 --> 33:37.395
I'm fine.

33:37.397 --> 33:39.397
It's okay.
First time sharing air.

33:39.399 --> 33:40.799
It's always
a little nerve-racking.

33:40.801 --> 33:42.367
All right,
when we get down to the bottom,

33:42.369 --> 33:43.667
I'm gonna turn off your air.

33:43.669 --> 33:44.769
Kahaia will buddy breathe
with you

33:44.771 --> 33:46.503
just like we practiced.

33:46.505 --> 33:47.842
Nothing to it.

33:50.877 --> 33:52.610
Come on. Lindz, this is vital.

33:52.612 --> 33:54.279
In the case that
something happens to your tank,

33:54.281 --> 33:55.679
you need to learn
how to share air.

33:55.681 --> 33:58.515
- I know.
- Okay.

33:58.517 --> 33:59.853
So jump in.

34:04.824 --> 34:06.824
Was your sister always this much
of a chicken growin' up?

34:06.826 --> 34:09.327
Oh, my God. All the time.

34:09.329 --> 34:10.562
Hey, do you remember that time

34:10.563 --> 34:11.728
we were
at that rocket-ship playground

34:11.731 --> 34:12.996
and you wouldn't go down
the slide

34:12.998 --> 34:14.764
'cause there were ants
at the bottom?

34:14.766 --> 34:15.934
Ants?

34:15.936 --> 34:17.768
Or the time that

34:17.771 --> 34:19.303
she wouldn't come
in the sewer with me

34:19.304 --> 34:20.536
because it smelled like pee-pee.

34:20.539 --> 34:22.407
I was, like, eight.

34:22.409 --> 34:24.641
Okay, well, then,
let's not forget the time

34:24.643 --> 34:25.943
that you bailed off your bike

34:25.945 --> 34:27.610
right before the ramp
that we built

34:27.612 --> 34:31.581
because you were afraid
of breaking your neck.

34:31.583 --> 34:34.286
And she purpled her wrists.

34:35.920 --> 34:39.260
Oh, come on.
Lindz, I'm just messing.

34:40.494 --> 34:41.824
Hey, you got this.

34:41.827 --> 34:44.364
Well, you bet your ass she does.

34:45.331 --> 34:47.599
Hey, you trust me, right?

34:47.601 --> 34:49.699
- Always.
- All right. Well, then...

34:49.702 --> 34:52.603
Don't do this for me,
don't do this for Paige,

34:52.606 --> 34:56.440
don't do it for the thousands
of viewers out there watching.

34:56.443 --> 34:58.809
- Do it for you.
- For me?

34:58.811 --> 35:01.945
Yeah. Just you.

35:01.947 --> 35:04.584
You can do anything.
Never forget that.

35:12.825 --> 35:15.593
Come on, Lindz. You have to.

39:16.669 --> 39:17.805
Ah!

39:22.675 --> 39:23.941
Ah!

39:36.822 --> 39:38.091
You want me?

39:40.026 --> 39:41.762
Come and get me!

39:43.028 --> 39:44.564
Come on!

39:50.169 --> 39:53.307
You scared 'em away.
You scared 'em away, Lindz.

40:50.930 --> 40:51.995
What the hell?

40:54.834 --> 40:57.303
Oh, my God. Evan.

41:10.150 --> 41:11.718
Oh, my God, Evan.

41:15.689 --> 41:18.088
Evan. Oh, my God. Oh.

41:18.090 --> 41:20.158
Oh, I'm so sorry.

41:20.160 --> 41:21.762
I won't leave you here.

41:22.829 --> 41:24.832
Come on.

41:26.398 --> 41:29.969
Oh, my God!

41:31.137 --> 41:33.807
No, no. Get away from him!

41:36.443 --> 41:38.245
No, no...

41:40.847 --> 41:42.883
I won't let you take him!

41:44.150 --> 41:46.253
No! No!

41:47.352 --> 41:50.124
No! No!

41:57.831 --> 41:59.233
I'm sorry.

42:00.265 --> 42:01.869
I'm sorry.

42:20.052 --> 42:22.452
This is Lindsey.

42:22.454 --> 42:25.289
Uh, Lindsey Lewis.

42:25.291 --> 42:27.492
A plane carrying my sister
and our friends

42:27.494 --> 42:30.798
crashed somewhere
near Red Rock Cove.

42:32.030 --> 42:33.467
Everyone is...

42:36.202 --> 42:38.939
They're all gone, so, uh...

42:40.807 --> 42:42.405
If you find this, uh,

42:42.407 --> 42:46.212
could you please give it
to my family and tell them...

42:52.885 --> 42:54.387
Tell them I love them.

43:34.193 --> 43:37.864
You can do anything.
Never forget that.

43:49.142 --> 43:50.477
That was for me.

43:51.910 --> 43:53.447
And so is this.

43:59.218 --> 44:00.887
Your sister's amazing.

44:03.523 --> 44:06.794
Love, it makes people
do crazy things.

44:08.093 --> 44:09.428
Shut up, Evan.

45:06.184 --> 45:07.587
Ah!

45:13.258 --> 45:14.861
Ah!

45:16.396 --> 45:17.898
What are you doing?

45:21.434 --> 45:22.936
What are you doing?

45:26.305 --> 45:28.941
Oh, crap.

45:30.309 --> 45:31.445
Yeah.

45:47.660 --> 45:49.529
Crap! Damn it!

45:50.963 --> 45:52.164
Oh, God.

47:13.378 --> 47:14.514
Ah...

47:33.832 --> 47:36.068
Ah. Oh, great.

47:37.102 --> 47:38.671
Oh, God.

47:44.610 --> 47:47.280
Fine, arrest me.

47:53.186 --> 47:55.318
The crazy-ass pilot was right.

47:55.320 --> 47:57.153
Oh. Oh, yes.

47:57.155 --> 47:59.258
Oh, oh, oh.

48:24.816 --> 48:26.186
Oh-ho.

48:42.267 --> 48:45.236
Oh! Oh, thank God!

48:45.238 --> 48:47.338
Hello? Hello?

48:50.175 --> 48:53.144
I'm trapped at Red Rock Cove.
Is anybody there?

48:55.447 --> 48:56.582
Anybody?

48:59.285 --> 49:00.587
Anybody?

49:10.863 --> 49:12.332
Here we go.

49:20.539 --> 49:22.575
Okay, all right.

49:33.619 --> 49:36.253
Ah, damn it!

49:40.392 --> 49:41.461
Please.

49:42.427 --> 49:44.428
Please.

50:33.479 --> 50:34.681
Oh, my God.

50:36.314 --> 50:38.414
Paige? Oh.

50:38.416 --> 50:41.188
Oh, my God, it's you!
I can't believe it!

50:42.354 --> 50:43.921
I can't believe you're alive!

50:43.923 --> 50:46.490
Am I?

50:46.492 --> 50:49.392
Yes. Where did you
even come from?

50:49.394 --> 50:52.028
The other side
of the cove. I saw a flare.

50:52.030 --> 50:53.796
That was me.

50:53.798 --> 50:56.033
I let the tide
bring me over.

50:56.035 --> 50:57.901
Come on.

50:57.903 --> 51:00.403
Y-you have
to get out of the water.

51:00.405 --> 51:02.606
I can't swim,
my leg is jacked up.

51:02.608 --> 51:04.975
What do you mean?

51:04.977 --> 51:07.278
I think I broke it in the crash.

51:07.280 --> 51:10.417
Oh, crap. Um, hang on.

51:13.019 --> 51:16.419
I have a rope, okay?
I'm gonna throw it out to you.

51:16.421 --> 51:18.055
Uh-huh. Mm.

51:18.057 --> 51:20.227
- You ready?
- Yeah.

51:23.595 --> 51:25.296
I can't reach it.

51:25.298 --> 51:27.430
I don't think
it's long enough, Lindz.

51:27.432 --> 51:29.501
Okay, hang on. We'll try again!

51:32.704 --> 51:34.273
Okay.

51:38.343 --> 51:40.644
Hang on.

51:40.646 --> 51:43.414
Can you paddle towards me?
Use your arms.

51:43.416 --> 51:44.782
I'll try.

51:51.890 --> 51:53.691
All right, I'm gonna try again.
You ready?

51:53.693 --> 51:54.961
Okay.

51:58.798 --> 52:00.363
- Uh...
- Grab it!

52:00.365 --> 52:02.034
I can't reach that, Lindz.

52:03.568 --> 52:06.637
- Okay.
- Uh, I just...

52:06.639 --> 52:08.771
We'll try again!
We gotta get you out of there.

52:08.773 --> 52:12.508
All right,
just give me...

52:12.510 --> 52:16.412
- Can you just give me a moment?
- We don't have a moment.

52:16.414 --> 52:18.515
Paige!

52:18.517 --> 52:21.517
For once in your life,
listen to me.

52:21.519 --> 52:24.454
There are sharks in the water.

52:24.456 --> 52:26.590
- What? There are sh...
- Sharks.

52:26.592 --> 52:28.459
There are sharks?

52:28.461 --> 52:31.128
- Like, right now?
- Yes!

52:31.130 --> 52:33.696
All right?

52:33.698 --> 52:35.532
So I need you
to grab the damn rope!

52:35.534 --> 52:36.802
Throw the rope!

52:39.637 --> 52:41.571
Uh, I'm close.

52:41.573 --> 52:43.140
I got it!

52:43.142 --> 52:46.510
Okay. Okay...

52:46.512 --> 52:47.910
- Oh, my God.
- What?

52:54.119 --> 52:55.551
Faster!

52:58.490 --> 53:01.494
Ah...

53:02.794 --> 53:04.026
Where'd he go?

53:07.800 --> 53:09.669
I don't know. Could be anywhere.

53:13.139 --> 53:14.704
Oh, my God.

53:16.809 --> 53:19.813
Oh. Oh.

53:22.680 --> 53:24.883
Oh. Wait. Where are the others?
Are they okay?

53:26.619 --> 53:29.051
They didn't make it.

53:29.053 --> 53:32.021
What? Wait, what?
Wha-what do you mean?

53:32.023 --> 53:33.425
Sharks.

53:36.428 --> 53:37.428
No-no-no.

53:37.430 --> 53:40.633
Like, Ev-Evan and Kahaia?

53:42.901 --> 53:44.371
Seb?

53:48.706 --> 53:50.207
Okay.

53:50.209 --> 53:51.845
Oh, my God.

53:55.213 --> 53:57.416
Lindz, I'm so sorry.

54:05.657 --> 54:07.957
It's okay.
You're here now.

54:07.959 --> 54:09.728
We're together now.

54:14.499 --> 54:15.765
Wait. Wait, wait.
How are you?

54:15.767 --> 54:18.669
How are you?
How did you get here?

54:18.671 --> 54:21.441
I had a raft,
but the sharks ate it.

54:23.008 --> 54:24.878
How are you even alive?

54:28.079 --> 54:29.615
What are we gonna do?

54:31.082 --> 54:34.119
I sent up a flare, so hopefully,
help is coming soon.

54:35.553 --> 54:36.586
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.

54:36.588 --> 54:37.620
We gotta look at that leg.

54:37.622 --> 54:38.655
Oh, I know. It's bad.

54:38.657 --> 54:40.026
It's really bad.

54:43.928 --> 54:45.796
Here, drink this.

54:45.798 --> 54:47.965
Ah...

54:47.967 --> 54:49.836
All right, here we go.
Here we go.

54:51.135 --> 54:53.439
- Okay.
- Oh, we need to save this.

54:57.910 --> 54:59.108
- Ow, ow, ow!
- Try and straighten it.

54:59.110 --> 55:00.878
No, I can't straighten it.

55:00.880 --> 55:02.546
Honest, Lindsey.
I think we should just leave it.

55:02.548 --> 55:04.113
Okay, now is not the time
to be stubborn, Paige.

55:04.115 --> 55:05.615
I'm not being stubborn,
I'm in...

55:05.617 --> 55:07.719
Ah! Pain!

55:09.088 --> 55:10.620
I'm just trying to help.

55:10.622 --> 55:12.689
I see that,
but we are trying to mend

55:12.691 --> 55:13.957
a broken leg
with an ACE bandage.

55:13.959 --> 55:16.229
- This is stupid.
- God, stupid?

55:17.128 --> 55:19.028
Stupid

55:19.030 --> 55:22.666
was asking me to be a part
of all this to begin with.

55:22.668 --> 55:25.135
And I'm not you, Paige.

55:25.137 --> 55:29.171
Maybe I wanted to be,
but... I'm not.

55:29.173 --> 55:32.575
I don't win scholarships
or triathlons.

55:32.577 --> 55:36.181
I don't climb goddamn mountains.
I don't do any of this.

55:38.784 --> 55:43.586
But here I am.
Following in your footsteps.

55:43.588 --> 55:46.055
I thought if I did, I could,

55:46.057 --> 55:48.093
I could prove something
to you...

55:49.260 --> 55:51.497
that I was worthy
in your eyes...

55:52.231 --> 55:53.700
that I mattered.

55:55.267 --> 55:57.070
Talk about stupid.

55:59.104 --> 56:00.206
Lindz...

56:03.207 --> 56:05.077
That's as good
as it's gonna get.

56:13.751 --> 56:14.954
I'm sorry.

56:17.956 --> 56:19.224
I'm sorry, too.

56:25.965 --> 56:28.030
<i>Heard the distress call.
Anybody out there?</i>

56:28.032 --> 56:29.832
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, boy.

56:29.834 --> 56:31.801
Hello? Hello?

56:31.803 --> 56:33.202
<i>Are you guys all right?</i>

56:34.372 --> 56:35.972
We're okay.

56:35.974 --> 56:37.740
But my sister's leg is broken.

56:37.742 --> 56:40.242
Okay, calm down.
I'm gonna come and get you.

56:40.244 --> 56:42.345
Just hang tight while I call in
the Coast Guard.

56:42.347 --> 56:43.879
Oh, my God!

56:43.881 --> 56:45.282
Then we can help
your sister, okay?

56:45.284 --> 56:46.883
Okay, thank you.

56:46.885 --> 56:48.619
But be careful out there.

56:48.621 --> 56:50.053
There are sharks in the water.

56:50.055 --> 56:52.823
Sharks?
Yeah, don't worry about that.

56:52.825 --> 56:56.225
Okay, Shalom,
there are some sharks.

56:56.227 --> 56:58.729
- Okay.
- Okay.

56:58.731 --> 57:00.997
What are... What are they doing?

57:00.999 --> 57:02.235
Over there.

57:04.869 --> 57:07.269
Why are they looking for them?
Why aren't they coming to help?

57:07.271 --> 57:11.073
What? What? What? No.

57:11.075 --> 57:13.242
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey. What are they doing?

57:13.244 --> 57:15.012
- Come Help us!
- Forget about the sharks!

57:15.014 --> 57:17.282
- Hello?
- What are they doing?

57:22.053 --> 57:23.655
Cod!

57:26.791 --> 57:28.959
- Get out!
- Cod, give me your hand!

57:28.961 --> 57:31.327
Look out!
No, no, no, stop it!

57:31.329 --> 57:34.097
Watch...

57:34.099 --> 57:36.133
- Cod!
- Watch out!

57:42.106 --> 57:44.041
Oh, God.

57:50.682 --> 57:52.816
Oh, God.

57:52.818 --> 57:55.184
Oh, my God! Oh!

57:55.186 --> 57:56.855
Oh, my God!

58:12.470 --> 58:14.704
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

58:14.706 --> 58:16.375
It's okay. We're gonna be okay.

58:20.012 --> 58:21.845
We'll figure something out.

58:44.001 --> 58:45.202
<i>Hey.</i>

58:45.204 --> 58:46.369
What the hell, Paige?

58:46.371 --> 58:47.903
Rise and shine, you lovebirds.

58:47.905 --> 58:50.307
Damn, smells like sex in here.

58:50.309 --> 58:52.008
It's one year
for you guys, so we're shooting

58:52.010 --> 58:53.977
a special anniversary episode.

58:53.979 --> 58:55.278
You gotta be kidding me, Paige.

58:55.280 --> 58:58.448
Oh, boo.

58:58.450 --> 59:00.950
Damn, Seb. I gotta get
on that shoulder routine.

59:00.952 --> 59:02.285
What are you benching?
Like 300, 400?

59:02.287 --> 59:03.986
- You are such a bitch.
- Get dressed.

59:03.988 --> 59:06.358
I woke up this morning
with the greatest idea.

59:08.126 --> 59:09.195
Chop-chop.

59:17.535 --> 59:19.436
Which is why
people love you guys.

59:19.438 --> 59:21.104
Everything is organic.

59:21.106 --> 59:23.305
The way you met, all the things
that you have in common.

59:23.307 --> 59:26.075
- Yeah. Sickening, actually.
- I'm not gonna lie.

59:26.077 --> 59:27.977
It's blowing up our channel,
all people wanna talk about

59:27.979 --> 59:29.012
is Seb and Lindz.

59:29.014 --> 59:30.814
Excuse me.

59:30.816 --> 59:32.548
It's good, right?

59:32.550 --> 59:35.487
Yeah. But it can be better.

59:36.555 --> 59:37.957
How?

59:40.392 --> 59:42.195
You guys have to break up.

59:44.496 --> 59:46.930
Okay, look. Seriously,
it's brilliant, right?

59:46.932 --> 59:48.564
We stage a fight, it goes viral,

59:48.566 --> 59:50.566
Lindz has a ton
of new subscribers and you know,

59:50.568 --> 59:52.102
after a couple of weeks,
you make up

59:52.104 --> 59:54.037
and we're just bigger
than ever before.

59:54.039 --> 59:57.140
Gets better ads, more sponsors,
more amazing trips.

59:57.142 --> 59:58.408
Worst idea ever.

59:58.410 --> 59:59.809
Yeah, no one would believe it.

59:59.811 --> 01:00:01.044
Why would we break up?

01:00:01.046 --> 01:00:02.979
Seb admits
that he cheated on you.

01:00:02.981 --> 01:00:04.881
Uh, just one time, got wasted,
simple mistake.

01:00:04.883 --> 01:00:07.517
The apology video alone will get
us, like, eight million views.

01:00:07.519 --> 01:00:09.952
- Forget it, Paige.
- Yeah.

01:00:09.954 --> 01:00:13.189
Seb would never cheat on me.
Everyone knows that.

01:00:13.191 --> 01:00:15.158
All the more reason
why this is so perfect.

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:18.093
This kind of drama could fund us
for the next three years.

01:00:18.095 --> 01:00:20.196
I'll volunteer
to sleep with Seb.

01:00:20.198 --> 01:00:22.064
You know, for the views.

01:00:22.066 --> 01:00:23.365
For the views,
I would sleep with Seb.

01:00:23.367 --> 01:00:24.466
Heh. Oh, yeah.

01:00:24.468 --> 01:00:26.570
Can you think about it, please?

01:00:26.572 --> 01:00:29.439
- Okay. We'll think about it.
- No, we won't.

01:00:29.441 --> 01:00:31.874
Come on, Seb.
This is a great plan.

01:00:31.876 --> 01:00:33.475
You're not thinking
about the bigger picture here.

01:00:33.477 --> 01:00:35.313
Actually, Paige, I am.

01:00:54.198 --> 01:00:55.401
Seb!

01:00:59.070 --> 01:01:00.238
Seb!

01:01:02.273 --> 01:01:03.606
Seb!

01:01:03.608 --> 01:01:05.642
- Hey, stay with me.
- No, he's out there.

01:01:05.644 --> 01:01:08.010
You can't help him,
he's gone.

01:01:08.012 --> 01:01:10.412
No. Seb!

01:01:10.414 --> 01:01:13.249
No!

01:01:13.251 --> 01:01:15.251
No, Seb!

01:01:17.122 --> 01:01:18.925
Hey, stay with me.
It's okay.

01:01:20.959 --> 01:01:22.161
We're okay.

01:01:31.669 --> 01:01:33.035
Do you think
they're gonna swim around

01:01:33.037 --> 01:01:34.372
out there all day?

01:01:35.941 --> 01:01:37.276
Probably.

01:01:39.177 --> 01:01:42.512
- We need to get to that boat.
- Yeah. I just think that...

01:01:42.514 --> 01:01:45.448
Oh, we just need to get on it
and then gun it.

01:01:45.450 --> 01:01:49.088
Yeah. Agreed. But how?
It's not like we can swim there.

01:01:53.525 --> 01:01:55.291
We gotta kill those sharks.

01:01:59.264 --> 01:02:00.566
Okay.

01:02:01.532 --> 01:02:03.435
Okay, I'm with that.

01:02:04.369 --> 01:02:05.637
What do we got?

01:02:07.372 --> 01:02:08.975
Uh, let's see.

01:02:15.447 --> 01:02:16.680
We can't use this for anything.

01:02:16.682 --> 01:02:18.080
Okay, we got

01:02:18.082 --> 01:02:21.216
some gasoline and the flare gun.

01:02:21.218 --> 01:02:23.385
Maybe we could light
one of them on fire.

01:02:23.387 --> 01:02:25.321
Lindz, they're sharks,
they're just gonna swim down

01:02:25.323 --> 01:02:27.457
and put themselves out.

01:02:33.597 --> 01:02:35.999
I got an idea.

01:02:36.001 --> 01:02:37.102
What is it?

01:02:39.236 --> 01:02:41.206
All right,
let's hope this works.

01:02:48.012 --> 01:02:49.648
Here, fishy-fishy!

01:02:52.383 --> 01:02:54.019
Here, fishy!

01:02:55.454 --> 01:02:57.189
Come here...

01:02:58.590 --> 01:03:00.191
Come here!

01:03:01.325 --> 01:03:03.195
Come on!

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:10.702
Come here!

01:03:13.005 --> 01:03:14.269
I don't know if this is gonna...

01:03:19.610 --> 01:03:21.711
- That was close.
- Are you okay?

01:03:21.713 --> 01:03:23.479
Yeah, but I don't know
if I wanna do it again.

01:03:23.481 --> 01:03:26.149
Yeah, well, this is a dumb idea.

01:03:29.253 --> 01:03:30.754
No, screw it.

01:03:30.756 --> 01:03:33.289
Let's go again. You ready?

01:03:33.291 --> 01:03:35.158
Um, I mean...

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:37.163
Wh-what?

01:03:39.764 --> 01:03:41.497
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

01:03:41.499 --> 01:03:43.198
- Come on!
- What are you doing?

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:44.533
Get over here!

01:03:44.535 --> 01:03:47.102
Bring it on!

01:03:47.104 --> 01:03:48.303
- Come on!
- Lindz!

01:03:48.305 --> 01:03:50.506
Lindz, get up here right now!

01:03:50.508 --> 01:03:51.707
- What are you doing?
- Come on!

01:03:51.709 --> 01:03:53.776
- Are you a crazy person?
- Oh, shit.

01:03:53.778 --> 01:03:55.144
Lindz, listen to me right now.

01:03:55.146 --> 01:03:56.713
- Get up here.
- Wait!

01:03:56.715 --> 01:03:58.814
- Hurry!
- Come on! Bring it on!

01:03:58.816 --> 01:04:00.649
Lindz, I'm not kidding.
Get on the platform!

01:04:00.651 --> 01:04:04.023
- Come on!
- Are you crazy? Get up here!

01:04:05.389 --> 01:04:06.555
Lindz, hurry!

01:04:06.557 --> 01:04:08.191
Now!

01:04:32.784 --> 01:04:35.417
Oh, my God. I can't believe
you just jumped in like that.

01:04:35.419 --> 01:04:37.187
That was so insane.

01:04:37.189 --> 01:04:39.254
I learned from the best.

01:04:41.626 --> 01:04:42.695
Oh...

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:51.137
Oh. Wow.

01:05:00.412 --> 01:05:02.381
Well, one down.

01:05:03.347 --> 01:05:04.516
Great.

01:05:06.351 --> 01:05:08.119
Shall we try again?

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:12.155
Yeah. Let's see if we can find
some more loose rocks.

01:05:12.157 --> 01:05:14.524
Okay.

01:05:14.526 --> 01:05:16.859
Uh, you're not jumping in
like that, though.

01:05:24.503 --> 01:05:27.769
I never in a million years
would imagine you doing this.

01:05:27.771 --> 01:05:29.775
Do you feel like a total badass?

01:05:30.809 --> 01:05:32.841
I'm gettin' there.

01:05:32.843 --> 01:05:34.477
Today, I think,
I'm cooler than you.

01:05:34.479 --> 01:05:36.247
Okay, easy, tiger.

01:05:38.816 --> 01:05:40.351
You know what?

01:05:42.553 --> 01:05:43.887
I don't think
there are anymore loose rocks.

01:05:43.889 --> 01:05:46.655
- I don't see anything.
- Are you sure?

01:05:46.657 --> 01:05:48.593
I don't think
this is gonna work.

01:05:51.695 --> 01:05:54.863
Well, the captain called in
the Coast Guard, right?

01:05:54.865 --> 01:05:56.765
Maybe help is on the way.

01:05:56.767 --> 01:06:00.336
No, he said he was gonna
call 'em in. It didn't happen.

01:06:00.338 --> 01:06:01.671
I mean, it can't take too long

01:06:01.673 --> 01:06:03.372
before someone realizes
they're missing, right?

01:06:03.374 --> 01:06:05.510
Can we really afford to wait
that long?

01:06:09.514 --> 01:06:11.948
Look, if we get it down
to one shark,

01:06:11.950 --> 01:06:13.383
I can swim out to that boat.

01:06:13.385 --> 01:06:14.751
No, you're not doing that.

01:06:14.753 --> 01:06:16.519
And even if you did,
the sharks might just

01:06:16.521 --> 01:06:17.854
knock you off
like it did them anyway.

01:06:17.856 --> 01:06:19.758
Do you have a better idea?

01:06:23.595 --> 01:06:25.497
Do we have any full air tanks?

01:06:27.432 --> 01:06:28.467
No.

01:06:30.334 --> 01:06:32.602
- Damn.
- Why?

01:06:32.604 --> 01:06:36.606
Uh, I saw a guy
knock the valve off of one once

01:06:36.608 --> 01:06:38.274
and it send it flying
like a torpedo.

01:06:38.276 --> 01:06:39.841
It almost killed the guy.

01:06:39.843 --> 01:06:43.213
- It's a good idea, but...
- Yeah.

01:06:43.215 --> 01:06:46.816
I mean, you can't really
aim easily anyway.

01:06:46.818 --> 01:06:48.850
Hey, look.

01:06:48.852 --> 01:06:51.456
That's the harpoon gun
that guy had.

01:06:52.957 --> 01:06:55.425
- I'm gonna get it.
- No, no. You're not doing that.

01:06:55.427 --> 01:06:57.359
- That's too dangerous.
- No, we need it.

01:06:57.361 --> 01:06:59.995
Lindz...

01:06:59.997 --> 01:07:01.863
I'm gonna go
with or without your help.

01:07:01.865 --> 01:07:04.700
What? No. Lindz... Wait, wait...
Okay, wait.

01:07:04.702 --> 01:07:06.602
At least just...
Oh, well...

01:07:06.604 --> 01:07:08.905
Give me a moment to...

01:07:08.907 --> 01:07:11.608
Hey, you help me grab
some of these rocks.

01:07:11.610 --> 01:07:13.512
Ow! Ugh!

01:07:23.488 --> 01:07:25.021
All right.

01:07:25.023 --> 01:07:26.691
Ugh, this could do.

01:07:28.892 --> 01:07:30.461
Give me your hand.

01:07:31.796 --> 01:07:34.800
- Oh, ow!
- Eh, it doesn't hurt that bad.

01:07:38.535 --> 01:07:40.472
- Ah!
- Sorry, what?

01:07:42.706 --> 01:07:44.606
Okay.

01:07:44.608 --> 01:07:46.211
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:07:49.581 --> 01:07:51.749
One, two, three!

01:08:12.369 --> 01:08:14.239
Oh, hey, look.
It's actually working.

01:08:16.974 --> 01:08:18.573
Wait, Lindz!

01:08:24.515 --> 01:08:27.518
Okay. Um...

01:08:30.321 --> 01:08:31.687
Oh, my God.

01:08:31.689 --> 01:08:33.459
Oh, my God. Lindz, hurry up.

01:08:37.862 --> 01:08:40.799
No, no, no...
Lindz, Lindz, Lindz! Lindz!

01:08:45.437 --> 01:08:48.870
Lindz, swim faster! Swim! Swim!
They're coming for you!

01:08:48.872 --> 01:08:51.073
Lindz, Lindz, hurry, hurry!

01:08:51.076 --> 01:08:53.443
Lindz!

01:08:55.746 --> 01:08:57.649
No!

01:09:01.553 --> 01:09:04.456
No! No! No, Paige!

01:09:32.015 --> 01:09:34.452
Ah. Come on!

01:09:38.055 --> 01:09:40.654
Oh, my God!

01:09:45.429 --> 01:09:47.462
- Oh, God.
- We gotta stop the bleeding.

01:09:47.464 --> 01:09:50.932
- It's, it's too deep.
- Okay, okay.

01:09:50.934 --> 01:09:53.033
God, Paige! Why did you jump in?

01:09:53.036 --> 01:09:54.839
It was gonna get you!

01:09:59.510 --> 01:10:01.543
I was always
such a, a bitch to you.

01:10:01.545 --> 01:10:03.512
Stop, stop,
we have gotta stay focused.

01:10:03.514 --> 01:10:05.414
Yeah, remember that time
in seventh grade,

01:10:05.416 --> 01:10:07.483
it was your choir solo
and I made...

01:10:07.485 --> 01:10:10.019
mom and dad take me home
because I was sick?

01:10:10.021 --> 01:10:13.055
- Yeah.
- I made it up.

01:10:13.057 --> 01:10:16.728
Because I, I couldn't bear you
taking the spotlight.

01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:20.462
And it wasn't the only time.

01:10:20.464 --> 01:10:22.899
Maybe if we elevate your leg,
the bleeding will slow.

01:10:22.901 --> 01:10:26.468
No, I resented you my whole life
just 'cause you were the baby

01:10:26.470 --> 01:10:27.803
and because everyone
loved you the most.

01:10:27.805 --> 01:10:29.739
- Paige, just stop.
- You deserved better.

01:10:29.741 --> 01:10:31.744
- Shut up!
- I came on to Seb.

01:10:40.652 --> 01:10:43.155
The night
you guys started dating...

01:10:45.456 --> 01:10:46.922
I invited him to my room.

01:10:46.924 --> 01:10:48.791
Bullshit.

01:10:48.793 --> 01:10:50.693
I kissed him

01:10:50.695 --> 01:10:53.195
because I liked him for so long

01:10:53.197 --> 01:10:56.132
before you even joined
our group.

01:10:56.134 --> 01:10:59.468
Stop lying. You want me
to hate you, but I won't.

01:10:59.470 --> 01:11:02.238
No, and then
the little baby sister comes

01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:03.806
and gets whatever she wants

01:11:03.808 --> 01:11:06.545
and I had to prove that I was...

01:11:08.179 --> 01:11:09.212
better than you.

01:11:09.214 --> 01:11:12.681
Stop. Stop it! Just stop lying!

01:11:12.683 --> 01:11:14.887
Huh. Do you wanna hear
the best part?

01:11:15.987 --> 01:11:17.523
Are you ready?

01:11:22.059 --> 01:11:23.495
He said no.

01:11:24.963 --> 01:11:27.832
He literally pushed me off
because...

01:11:29.032 --> 01:11:30.902
He loved you, Lindz.

01:11:33.705 --> 01:11:34.904
This whole trip was his idea.

01:11:34.906 --> 01:11:36.475
He was gonna...

01:11:37.241 --> 01:11:38.641
propose to you.

01:11:38.643 --> 01:11:40.909
No, that's not true.

01:11:40.911 --> 01:11:42.914
Sixty feet under. Ring and all.

01:11:51.688 --> 01:11:54.192
It's, it's over, Lindz.
It's all right.

01:11:55.192 --> 01:11:57.159
No.

01:11:57.161 --> 01:11:59.798
- You deserved better.
- No.

01:12:00.764 --> 01:12:02.034
No.

01:12:03.567 --> 01:12:05.534
- No!
- I'm so...

01:12:05.536 --> 01:12:07.035
Paige.

01:12:07.037 --> 01:12:09.073
No, Paige, stay with me.

01:12:11.009 --> 01:12:12.878
Paige!

01:12:15.146 --> 01:12:17.883
No, no...
Ah...

01:12:19.017 --> 01:12:20.552
No, no.

01:12:22.987 --> 01:12:24.623
No!

01:13:53.277 --> 01:13:55.276
All right.

01:13:55.278 --> 01:13:57.178
You son of a bitch.

01:14:01.652 --> 01:14:04.386
Come and get me!

01:14:04.388 --> 01:14:05.790
Come on!

01:14:11.262 --> 01:14:12.798
Come on!

01:14:15.933 --> 01:14:16.966
Ah!

01:14:21.339 --> 01:14:23.842
You!

01:15:05.116 --> 01:15:06.652
I got you!

01:15:07.884 --> 01:15:09.220
Yeah!

01:15:18.329 --> 01:15:19.430
Yeah.

01:15:21.765 --> 01:15:22.933
No!

01:15:29.272 --> 01:15:32.041
No. Let her go!

01:15:32.043 --> 01:15:35.280
Leave her alone! Let her go!

01:15:38.883 --> 01:15:41.219
No. Paige!

01:15:42.353 --> 01:15:43.755
Oh.

01:15:45.490 --> 01:15:46.957
I'm sorry.

01:16:36.406 --> 01:16:39.041
Ah! Ah!

01:16:54.125 --> 01:16:57.025
Damn it.

01:16:57.027 --> 01:16:58.963
Okay. Okay.

01:17:02.332 --> 01:17:06.068
Ah! Yes. Oh, okay.

01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:08.904
Oh, oh, okay.

01:17:08.906 --> 01:17:10.138
Hello?

01:17:11.509 --> 01:17:13.575
Hello, is anybody there?

01:17:15.179 --> 01:17:16.314
Hello?

01:17:36.968 --> 01:17:38.601
Just one second.

01:17:38.603 --> 01:17:42.037
Hm. All right.
I think you're all set.

01:17:42.039 --> 01:17:44.373
You really take this dive-buddy
thing pretty seriously.

01:17:44.375 --> 01:17:46.208
Well, call me crazy,
but maybe I want you

01:17:46.210 --> 01:17:48.113
to stick around a little longer.

01:17:51.549 --> 01:17:55.383
All right, let's get wet. You're
gonna love it down there, Lindz.

01:17:55.385 --> 01:17:57.088
I love anything with you.

01:17:57.988 --> 01:17:59.191
- Ditto.
- Hm.

01:18:01.192 --> 01:18:03.061
Make sure her tank is secure.

01:18:07.231 --> 01:18:08.400
It is.

01:18:12.036 --> 01:18:13.034
Tanks.

01:18:16.506 --> 01:18:17.909
Okay.

01:18:19.175 --> 01:18:20.512
Tank.

01:18:21.478 --> 01:18:23.481
Okay. Uh, the tank.

01:18:28.085 --> 01:18:29.287
God!

01:18:31.554 --> 01:18:34.289
Ah, goddammit, you bastard!

01:18:34.291 --> 01:18:37.525
Ah! Okay. Okay.

01:18:39.263 --> 01:18:42.030
Okay, Paige.
Talk me through this.

01:18:42.032 --> 01:18:44.102
How do I do this?

01:18:46.137 --> 01:18:47.906
All right. How do I do this?

01:18:49.607 --> 01:18:50.642
Okay.

01:18:52.108 --> 01:18:54.208
Paige, please tell me
how to do this.

01:18:57.348 --> 01:18:58.950
Aah!

01:19:07.724 --> 01:19:09.525
Oh, Lindsey,
what the hell are you doing?

01:19:09.527 --> 01:19:11.392
You can do anything.

01:19:11.394 --> 01:19:14.096
Never forget that.

01:19:14.098 --> 01:19:16.565
So you just
don't ever give up.

01:19:16.567 --> 01:19:17.969
Ever.

01:19:20.437 --> 01:19:23.275
All right.

01:19:25.175 --> 01:19:27.443
All right. All right.

01:19:37.754 --> 01:19:39.754
Oh, God.

01:19:45.196 --> 01:19:46.398
Come on.

01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:48.566
Come on!

01:19:59.175 --> 01:20:02.677
Ah, come on.

01:20:02.679 --> 01:20:04.615
All right. Here we go.

01:20:05.515 --> 01:20:07.451
Come on! Here we go.

01:20:17.795 --> 01:20:19.097
Oh, my God.

01:20:30.808 --> 01:20:32.143
Ah!

01:20:34.545 --> 01:20:35.647
Please.

01:20:36.679 --> 01:20:38.115
Ah!

01:20:41.085 --> 01:20:42.684
Oh, my God! No!

01:20:42.686 --> 01:20:44.453
Come on, you piece of...

01:20:44.455 --> 01:20:46.091
Ah!

01:20:47.157 --> 01:20:49.626
No! Oh!

01:21:08.478 --> 01:21:10.145
It worked.

01:21:10.147 --> 01:21:13.251
Oh, Paige, it worked.

01:21:16.454 --> 01:21:18.753
Oh, my God.

01:21:18.755 --> 01:21:21.159
Oh, Paige...

01:21:28.732 --> 01:21:29.832
We did it.

01:22:22.353 --> 01:22:24.485
Hi, everyone.

01:22:24.487 --> 01:22:26.687
I know it's been a while
since our last post.

01:22:26.689 --> 01:22:29.725
Six months, actually.

01:22:29.727 --> 01:22:31.459
But you all heard the stories
by now.

01:22:31.461 --> 01:22:33.494
You all know what happened.

01:22:33.496 --> 01:22:36.597
I'm not here
to get into details. I just...

01:22:36.599 --> 01:22:37.900
I wanted you all to know
that the people

01:22:37.902 --> 01:22:39.935
who made this channel,

01:22:39.937 --> 01:22:41.904
they cared about you.

01:22:41.906 --> 01:22:44.306
They really did.

01:22:44.308 --> 01:22:46.374
They created unique moments
and shared their lives

01:22:46.376 --> 01:22:50.279
to show you things that you
might not ever get to see.

01:22:50.281 --> 01:22:53.548
They were the next generation
of explorers.

01:22:53.550 --> 01:22:56.185
Each and every one of them.

01:22:56.187 --> 01:22:58.787
Evan, Kahaia...

01:22:58.789 --> 01:22:59.890
Seb...

01:23:01.325 --> 01:23:03.193
and my sister, Paige.

01:23:07.464 --> 01:23:08.497
We lost them out there,

01:23:08.499 --> 01:23:11.402
but we didn't lose their spirit.

01:23:13.469 --> 01:23:17.940
Their work was important, vital.

01:23:17.942 --> 01:23:20.609
And I'm not about to let it end.

01:23:20.611 --> 01:23:23.578
The world has too much to offer.

01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:26.750
So I'm gonna keep sharing
every moment with you.

01:23:28.219 --> 01:23:29.621
Thanks for watching.

01:23:30.521 --> 01:23:31.919
I'm Lindsey Lewis

01:23:31.921 --> 01:23:34.625
and this is <i>The Lit Life.</i>

01:23:51.875 --> 01:23:54.612
"Never stop, ever."

01:24:14.732 --> 01:24:16.367
You can do anything.
