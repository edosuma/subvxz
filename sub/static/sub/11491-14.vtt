WEBVTT

00:02.760 --> 00:03.782
Mm, oh.

00:03.959 --> 00:07.822
And here's another money saver.
If you buy a big bag of irregular socks...

00:07.992 --> 00:11.479
...you can pair up the good ones and use
the cash you save for underwear.

00:12.757 --> 00:14.188
Good to know.

00:14.357 --> 00:18.015
And you can use the leftover misfit
socks for dusting gloves...

00:18.189 --> 00:20.313
...golf club cozies,
even a hand puppet.

00:21.288 --> 00:22.310
A hand puppet?

00:22.487 --> 00:25.680
Oh, sure. A couple of buttons
for eyes and you're ready to go.

00:25.853 --> 00:27.148
Hello, pretty lady.

00:28.652 --> 00:30.277
Funny.

00:37.250 --> 00:38.840
So have you done Internet dating?

00:39.015 --> 00:43.708
All the time. If you're interested, I know
a couple of tricks to weed out the losers.

00:45.047 --> 00:47.103
I'm very interested.

00:49.012 --> 00:51.671
- Hey, how are you?
- Hi.

00:51.845 --> 00:54.106
- Oh, you know him?
- No.

00:54.611 --> 00:55.634
Oh.

00:55.811 --> 00:59.435
Talking to strange women.
Must be drunk.

00:59.610 --> 01:02.632
Anyway, my profile
says that I am a chiropractor...

01:02.808 --> 01:05.364
...but I also do a lot of holistic work.

01:05.541 --> 01:07.472
You know, acupressure,
tissue massage...

01:07.640 --> 01:10.162
...both of which promote a
sense of well-being...

01:10.340 --> 01:13.771
...and also a heightened
sexual sensitivity. Heh.

01:14.838 --> 01:20.700
Assuming, of course, your
sexual sensitivity requires heightening.

01:21.869 --> 01:25.164
I have absolutely no intention
of sleeping with you, Alan.

01:25.335 --> 01:29.663
Whoa. Whoa, where'd that come from?
I'm just talking about my job.

01:29.833 --> 01:31.628
Making conversation.

01:31.799 --> 01:35.094
And when you say "absolutely no
intention," you mean tonight, right?

01:37.930 --> 01:41.020
- You look like you could one of these.
- You're a mind reader.

01:41.863 --> 01:46.692
Excuse me, but I am with this lady
and if she would like another drink...

01:46.862 --> 01:49.293
...I am more than capable
of providing one.

01:49.460 --> 01:51.789
But the dinner's still Dutch.

01:53.726 --> 01:55.487
- What's your name?
- Louanne.

01:55.658 --> 01:57.123
Hi, Louanne, I'm Marcus.

01:57.291 --> 02:01.450
All right, all right, fun time's over.
Look, Marcus...

02:01.624 --> 02:05.111
...the lady is on a date with me
and you are intruding.

02:05.289 --> 02:06.754
Ask the lady what she wants.

02:06.922 --> 02:09.818
Not necessary. I can tell you what she
wants and it's not me.

02:11.020 --> 02:15.315
But there's a principle involved and that
is one of poaching another man's gal.

02:15.486 --> 02:17.747
- Is that so?
- Yes, that's so. Now take a hike.

02:17.918 --> 02:19.781
Just sit down and finish your peanuts.

02:19.952 --> 02:22.678
- Don't you touch me!
- Hey, hey, calm down.

02:23.350 --> 02:27.304
You're right, you're right. We should just
take a deep breath and calm down.

02:27.483 --> 02:32.743
That's a good idea. So, what are you
doing after Potsie here drops you off?

02:32.914 --> 02:34.072
Hey, Marcus?

02:38.179 --> 02:40.269
How's that, bitch?

02:45.744 --> 02:47.471
What are you doing in there?

02:47.976 --> 02:50.601
Be patient. I got you a surprise.

02:51.475 --> 02:54.463
You hear that? She got us a surprise.

02:56.307 --> 02:58.239
You gonna grab that?

03:00.739 --> 03:02.966
You'll have to be more specific.

03:03.138 --> 03:06.592
- Answer the phone, Charlie.
- Right, right.

03:07.470 --> 03:11.799
Hello? Whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow down, slow down. Who is this?

03:12.302 --> 03:16.165
Oh, hi, Alan.
Not a good time right now.

03:16.334 --> 03:17.765
Really?

03:17.934 --> 03:20.297
What the hell are you doing in jail?

03:21.265 --> 03:23.288
You're kidding me.

03:23.466 --> 03:26.192
That's hilarious.

03:26.897 --> 03:29.919
All right, all right, I'm on my way.

03:30.097 --> 03:31.653
What do you think?

03:37.994 --> 03:40.458
I was gonna save it for our wedding.
Couldn't wait.

03:40.626 --> 03:44.887
Oh, baby, by the time we get married
that thing's gonna be half-eaten.

03:48.791 --> 03:50.483
Who was on the phone?

03:50.690 --> 03:52.814
- Alan.
- Everything all right?

03:52.989 --> 03:55.715
Yeah, he was calling to say
he wouldn't be home tonight.

03:55.888 --> 03:57.820
Oh, did he get lucky?

03:57.987 --> 04:02.043
Not yet, but the night is still young.

04:04.000 --> 04:10.074

04:32.111 --> 04:37.132
Ten hours! Ten hours I sat in that
urine-soaked jail cell!

04:38.476 --> 04:40.703
You shouldn't have peed yourself.

04:40.874 --> 04:42.669
You said you'd be right there!

04:42.841 --> 04:46.738
Look, look, I understand your anger,
but you gotta see it from my side.

04:46.907 --> 04:50.668
- What's your side?
- I get really sleepy after sex.

04:52.072 --> 04:54.128
- What's going on?
- Oh. Your gallant fiancé...

04:54.304 --> 04:56.792
...let his brother
rot in a prison cell all night.

04:56.969 --> 04:58.060
- What?
- Oh, come on...

04:58.236 --> 05:02.462
...it was the Beverly Hills jail.
I've been there plenty of times.

05:02.635 --> 05:05.828
Slip the booking officer a 20,
he'll send out for Starbucks.

05:06.001 --> 05:08.761
You know I don't carry
that kind of cash.

05:09.366 --> 05:13.422
Regardless, it was just one night.
Nobody took your man cherry, did they?

05:15.798 --> 05:17.320
Was that why Alan called last night?

05:17.497 --> 05:19.758
Uh... I assume so.

05:19.929 --> 05:23.088
- Oh, Charlie.
- Hey. You had that sexy lingerie on...

05:23.262 --> 05:24.727
...and you were so beautiful.

05:25.228 --> 05:28.057
Plus, you know
how I hate to waste an erection.

05:28.560 --> 05:31.992
I can't believe you abandoned your
brother when he needed you. Horrible.

05:32.159 --> 05:35.148
How'd I become the bad guy
in all this? He's the felon.

05:35.325 --> 05:36.881
Why were you in jail, Alan?

05:37.191 --> 05:39.782
I was forced to use my hands to defend
a lady's honor.

05:40.190 --> 05:42.655
Ask him what happened to the lady.

05:43.356 --> 05:47.287
She drove the guy I punched
to the emergency room.

05:47.454 --> 05:50.443
Why would she go with him
if you were defending her honor?

05:50.620 --> 05:54.608
I would've asked her, but I was busy
being handcuffed and dragged off to jail.

05:54.786 --> 05:57.649
Where I spent the night
covering my behind with a food tray.

05:59.917 --> 06:02.747
Shame on you, Charlie Harper.

06:03.016 --> 06:04.209
Oh.

06:04.382 --> 06:06.904
Now she's mad at me. Happy?

06:07.648 --> 06:09.113
Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.

06:09.281 --> 06:13.042
If my transsexual-biker cellmate had only
been a little more affectionate...

06:13.213 --> 06:15.905
...my life would now be perfect!

06:19.878 --> 06:23.900
I don't know. I just snapped and hit him.
First time in my life that's happened.

06:24.077 --> 06:26.803
You mean it's the first time
you've ever won.

06:28.075 --> 06:31.199
The important thing now
is for you to know that your family...

06:31.374 --> 06:34.067
...is a hundred percent behind you.
- Thanks, Mom.

06:34.240 --> 06:37.569
Now, before we waste money
on some expensive lawyer...

06:37.739 --> 06:42.067
...how much jail time are we
talking about if you just roll over?

06:42.505 --> 06:43.868
I don't wanna go to jail.

06:44.038 --> 06:46.935
And if he does,
he certainly doesn't want to roll over.

06:47.903 --> 06:50.299
- Charles, that is crude and uncalled for.
- Thanks.

06:50.468 --> 06:53.831
You're welcome. Nobody
wants to go to jail, sweetie.

06:54.001 --> 06:58.489
Let's face it, if all we're talking about is
60 days alone in a room with no friends...

06:58.666 --> 07:02.654
...how is that different from two months
squatting in your brother's house?

07:03.198 --> 07:05.026
You're kidding, right?

07:05.630 --> 07:06.960
I guess.

07:07.530 --> 07:11.086
Don't worry yourself. I'll get a
public defender and take care of this.

07:11.262 --> 07:14.022
- There you go, problem solved.
- Charlie.

07:14.194 --> 07:16.489
Kid out of law school,
hungry to make his bones.

07:16.661 --> 07:21.058
What's wrong with that? He gets his
hair cut by trainees at the barber college.

07:22.659 --> 07:24.715
I'd be happy to help you hire a lawyer.

07:24.891 --> 07:26.686
No, I couldn't take money from you.

07:26.858 --> 07:28.720
That's an honor
he reserves for family.

07:30.189 --> 07:31.882
So you guys aren't gonna help him?

07:32.056 --> 07:34.419
Of course we are.
But if we didn't torture him...

07:34.621 --> 07:36.746
...he wouldn't
be comfortable accepting help.

07:36.920 --> 07:38.715
You don't know that. Try me.

07:40.120 --> 07:42.677
I'll find the lawyer
and we'll split the fee.

07:42.853 --> 07:48.011
Not fifty-fifty, because I'm out six years
of room, board and incidentals.

07:48.184 --> 07:51.444
And by incidentals, I mean mostly
Kleenex and hand lotion.

07:52.750 --> 07:57.340
Oh, please, I paid for four years
of college and chiropractor school...

07:57.515 --> 08:00.344
...and he still gives me
handmade tchotchkes for Christmas.

08:00.514 --> 08:02.604
You said you loved the pot holders
I made.

08:02.780 --> 08:04.870
I said they made me cry.

08:06.212 --> 08:08.370
Okay, okay, okay, fifty-fifty.

08:08.544 --> 08:11.509
But we'll put it on my card
so I get the miles.

08:12.176 --> 08:13.608
I can't believe you two.

08:13.776 --> 08:17.173
That's okay, Chelsea. I'm used to
being treated this way.

08:17.342 --> 08:21.239
The mocking,
the insults, the humiliation.

08:21.407 --> 08:25.032
It's all part of the festering ugliness
of this family.

08:29.705 --> 08:31.602
See? He's fine with it.

08:37.102 --> 08:39.693
Thanks for coming, you guys.
Your support means a lot.

08:39.868 --> 08:41.390
Thank her. If it was up to me...

08:41.601 --> 08:45.032
...you'd be in San Quentin
wearing lipstick and a mop wig.

08:45.200 --> 08:48.723
Okay, Mom, I gotta go. No, I love you.

08:48.898 --> 08:50.955
What? No, you're not bothering me.

08:51.132 --> 08:55.062
No, I'm happy to take care of it.
Okay, okay, bye-bye.

08:55.230 --> 08:58.820
Sorry. I bought my mom a new computer
and it's opened up a can of worms.

08:58.996 --> 09:02.086
Ironic. I just bought my mom
a can of worms.

09:03.628 --> 09:05.355
Brad Harlow. Are you Alan?

09:05.527 --> 09:08.720
No, no, no, I'm his brother Charlie.
That's my fiancée, Chelsea.

09:08.892 --> 09:13.448
And that pasty-faced jughead
is the family rottweiler.

09:13.625 --> 09:17.113
I just want it on record
that I am not by nature a violent man.

09:17.290 --> 09:21.812
My fuse is long,
but it is attached to dynamite.

09:23.521 --> 09:25.510
Shut up. I'm paying by the hour.

09:25.687 --> 09:28.380
Would you two just stop it? I'm sorry.

09:28.886 --> 09:32.215
That's all right. I have siblings too.
We tease each other constantly.

09:32.386 --> 09:36.010
You know, sometimes I think it's just
easier than saying "I love you."

09:38.883 --> 09:41.314
Okay, well, I got some
good news for you, Alan.

09:41.617 --> 09:44.081
Hey, when's the last time
you heard that?

09:44.848 --> 09:48.371
I made some calls. The fella you
punched has alcohol-related priors...

09:48.580 --> 09:51.011
...and is definitely not looking
to press charges.

09:51.180 --> 09:54.009
- I don't have to go back to jail?
- Not even a court room.

09:54.212 --> 09:57.302
Oh, thank God.
I can't go back to the joint again.

09:59.611 --> 10:02.735
All right, great, we're off the clock.
What do I owe you?

10:02.910 --> 10:04.569
Relax, you don't owe me anything.

10:05.076 --> 10:06.837
Even better. Thank you.

10:07.475 --> 10:09.872
Charlie. We have to pay you
for your time.

10:10.040 --> 10:12.165
Oh, you hippie.

10:12.773 --> 10:16.636
Well, you can always make
a donation to my charity.

10:17.072 --> 10:19.129
What's that? Lawyers without yachts?

10:21.438 --> 10:25.459
No, no, it's for inner-city kids. They
come out to my ranch once a month...

10:25.636 --> 10:28.158
...learn to ride horses,
get out in the fresh air.

10:28.336 --> 10:32.028
Oh, that's wonderful. I love horses.
I used to ride all the time.

10:32.200 --> 10:35.461
- Shall I write you a check?
- No, no, no, I got it.

10:35.633 --> 10:37.962
- Who do I make it out to?
- Danielle's Darlings.

10:38.132 --> 10:40.063
- Who's Danielle?
- My late wife.

10:40.232 --> 10:42.288
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, thank you.

10:42.464 --> 10:46.327
I started the charity to keep
her memory alive. She loved horses.

10:48.462 --> 10:51.257
Crap. That's another zero.

10:54.660 --> 10:55.717
There you go.

10:56.160 --> 10:59.455
Wow. This is incredibly generous.
Thank you.

10:59.626 --> 11:01.591
You're very welcome.

11:04.424 --> 11:08.719
We're having a nature ride and barbecue
for the kids Saturday. You should come.

11:08.890 --> 11:12.013
Really? That sounds wonderful.
Doesn't it, Charlie?

11:12.188 --> 11:14.380
Do the kids race the horses?

11:14.821 --> 11:16.786
What? No.

11:16.954 --> 11:19.476
- There's no action?
- No action.

11:20.053 --> 11:21.144
I don't see the point.

11:22.952 --> 11:24.111
He's just joking.

11:24.284 --> 11:27.011
No, I'm not.
I really don't see the point.

11:28.051 --> 11:31.016
If you change your mind, here's the info.
We'd love to see you.

11:31.182 --> 11:33.443
- Thank you. Maybe we will.
All right.

11:33.615 --> 11:35.444
Yeah, maybe.

11:39.780 --> 11:42.677
- Thanks very much, Brad.
- Always nice to bring good news.

11:42.845 --> 11:44.811
I think having a criminal record...

11:44.978 --> 11:47.910
...is really gonna
spice up my online-dating profile.

11:48.077 --> 11:50.440
Might even post the mugshot.

11:59.507 --> 12:01.132
Wasn't Brad terrific?

12:02.773 --> 12:04.705
Who's Brad?

12:05.539 --> 12:06.799
Alan's lawyer.

12:07.338 --> 12:09.462
Uh... He's okay, I guess.

12:09.637 --> 12:13.534
You guess? Not only does he have a
successful law practice...

12:13.703 --> 12:16.225
...he's doing so much
to help poor kids.

12:16.402 --> 12:20.061
What? By sticking them on horses?
How's that gonna help?

12:20.267 --> 12:22.459
Get them a high-paying
job with Pony Express?

12:23.167 --> 12:24.530
It's not about jobs...

12:24.700 --> 12:27.529
...it's about getting out of the city,
into the fresh air.

12:27.699 --> 12:30.823
Fresh air?
Have you ever smelled a horse?

12:30.997 --> 12:35.361
You know what I mean. And did you
hear the way he talked about family?

12:35.529 --> 12:37.688
They obviously mean a lot to him.

12:37.862 --> 12:40.692
Family also meant a lot
to Charles Manson.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.759
That's a terrible thing to say.

12:43.993 --> 12:45.220
Sorry.

12:47.126 --> 12:51.387
Hey, speaking of horseback riding,
hop on and I'll race you to the finish.

12:51.558 --> 12:53.786
You know what?
I'm not really in the mood.

12:53.957 --> 12:56.388
That's okay.
I got enough mood for both of us.

12:56.989 --> 12:58.285
Good night, Charlie.

13:00.322 --> 13:02.913
But Charlie's a frustrated pony.

13:03.087 --> 13:04.780
Go to sleep.

13:12.019 --> 13:13.041
You know...

13:13.218 --> 13:15.207
...I was pretty charitable today.
- Mm-hm.

13:16.450 --> 13:20.040
I guess the spirit of giving
doesn't extend to the bedroom, huh?

13:20.249 --> 13:22.476
Good night, Charlie.

13:22.649 --> 13:24.807
Pbbt.

13:30.879 --> 13:32.742
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:33.512 --> 13:36.170
- Can't sleep?
- Nope.

13:36.545 --> 13:37.703
Me neither.

13:37.877 --> 13:39.842
Even though I dodged
the legal bullet...

13:40.010 --> 13:43.134
...l've got all this stuff
building up inside me...

13:43.309 --> 13:45.171
...and I'm afraid I'm gonna explode.

13:45.341 --> 13:47.932
I'm afraid I won't.

13:50.773 --> 13:53.932
The other night in that bar,
I just snapped.

13:54.106 --> 13:56.264
It's like I became a different person.

13:56.738 --> 13:59.499
Well, that had to be a nice break
for you.

14:01.470 --> 14:03.129
I'm scared, Charlie.

14:03.303 --> 14:07.358
I mean, there was a part of me
that really enjoyed driving my fist...

14:07.535 --> 14:11.932
...into that jerk's stupid face, watching
him crumple to the floor in agony.

14:12.100 --> 14:13.827
So, what are you scared of?

14:14.000 --> 14:16.624
What if this is just the beginning?

14:16.798 --> 14:20.957
What if I've awakened some
long-dormant monster inside of me...

14:21.130 --> 14:23.857
...who revels in violence?

14:24.030 --> 14:27.222
What if I can't control the monster?

14:29.828 --> 14:32.157
What if the monster takes over?

14:34.560 --> 14:36.388
Ouchie.

14:39.725 --> 14:41.520
You're fine. Go to bed, monster.

14:43.257 --> 14:44.916
Okay, good night.

14:50.622 --> 14:52.349
What happened to your hand?

14:52.621 --> 14:54.882
Oh. Oh.

14:55.653 --> 14:57.346
I won't lie to you.

14:57.520 --> 15:00.144
I got into a bar fight
and punched a guy in the face.

15:01.285 --> 15:03.307
Yeah, right.

15:03.851 --> 15:06.509
No, I'm serious.
I spent the night in jail.

15:06.717 --> 15:10.648
Fine, don't tell me.
I was just trying to make conversation.

15:10.815 --> 15:13.303
I'm warning you.
There's a monster inside of me...

15:13.481 --> 15:15.742
...and you don't wanna wake him up!

15:15.914 --> 15:18.504
Oh, hot, hot, hot.

15:19.646 --> 15:23.577
Did the monster burn his mouth
with his chamomile tea?

15:23.745 --> 15:25.505
It's oolong.

15:26.511 --> 15:27.999
Where's Chelsea?

15:28.210 --> 15:32.232
She went to that charity thing
for inner-city horses.

15:37.107 --> 15:38.970
You let her go without you?

15:39.140 --> 15:42.867
Why the hell would I wanna go?
I hate kids and I'm scared of horses.

15:43.472 --> 15:46.699
Maybe you didn't notice the way
my lawyer looked at your fiancée.

15:47.304 --> 15:50.394
- What are you talking about?
- Or the way she was looking at him.

15:50.570 --> 15:51.830
That's ridiculous.

15:52.003 --> 15:55.490
I'm telling you, there were definitely
sparks between the two of them.

15:56.702 --> 15:58.099
You think?

15:58.267 --> 16:00.529
Charlie, that guy
is everything you're not.

16:01.333 --> 16:02.923
Well, what's that mean?

16:03.099 --> 16:04.997
He likes people...

16:05.732 --> 16:07.754
...he loves his mother...

16:07.931 --> 16:09.089
...works with children...

16:09.264 --> 16:13.195
...and he doesn't stumble through life
stinking of whiskey and K-Y Jelly.

16:13.696 --> 16:16.025
Hey, hey, hey, K-Y Jelly is odorless.

16:16.195 --> 16:17.354
Not where you put it.

16:21.993 --> 16:24.584
I'm just saying that if
Chelsea were my fiancée...

16:24.759 --> 16:26.815
...I wouldn't leave her alone
with this guy.

16:26.992 --> 16:29.389
If she was your fiancée,
you'd have big problems.

16:29.558 --> 16:32.886
- Like what?
- Like being the last man on Earth.

16:37.622 --> 16:39.746
I don't understand why I have to go.

16:39.921 --> 16:43.284
Because your uncle wants to use you
to camouflage his growing fear...

16:43.453 --> 16:45.715
...his girlfriend
is interested in another guy.

16:45.886 --> 16:47.374
Hey, hey, hey, I have no fear.

16:47.552 --> 16:51.949
Of course not. You just got a sudden
craving for barbecue and horses.

16:52.118 --> 16:54.447
Whoa, there's gonna be
barbecued horses?

16:56.050 --> 16:57.811
Cool.

16:58.249 --> 17:00.737
Where the hell is
this lawyer's stupid ranch?

17:00.915 --> 17:03.436
You must've passed the turnoff.
Put the GPS back on.

17:03.614 --> 17:05.307
I don't need the GPS.

17:05.481 --> 17:08.002
<i>Take the next legal U-turn.</i>

17:08.179 --> 17:12.109
<i>Then proceed 22 miles to main road.</i>

17:13.045 --> 17:15.306
- Okay, turn around.
- There's no room.

17:15.478 --> 17:17.443
- Well, then back up.
- Twenty-two miles?

17:17.609 --> 17:20.040
Just till you find a place to turn.

17:20.209 --> 17:22.834
- I'm hungry.
- We're almost there.

17:23.008 --> 17:25.132
I don't think so.
I'd smell the barbecue.

17:25.707 --> 17:29.161
Jake, would you pipe down
so I can concentrate on...?

17:30.372 --> 17:31.769
Oh, damn.

17:31.939 --> 17:35.802
<i>You have reached your destination.</i>

17:35.971 --> 17:37.868
I don't think so.

17:42.869 --> 17:45.061
- Un-freaking-believable.
- Still no signal.

17:45.235 --> 17:48.563
Well, of course there's no signal.
We're in the middle of nowhere.

17:48.733 --> 17:51.926
- I'm starving.
- What do you want? Go catch a squirrel.

17:52.100 --> 17:56.031
This is why I always tell you
to keep an emergency kit in your car.

17:56.198 --> 17:57.754
- Yeah.
- No matter what happens...

17:57.931 --> 18:00.556
...I know that in my trunk
is a thermal blanket...

18:00.730 --> 18:04.922
...flashlight, batteries, bottled water
and assorted protein bars.

18:05.096 --> 18:07.493
You hear that, Jake?
You have an inheritance.

18:09.294 --> 18:11.691
I already ate the protein bars.

18:14.159 --> 18:18.215
You were right, Alan. The more time
Chelsea spends with this Brad guy...

18:18.391 --> 18:20.879
...the more time
she's gonna have to compare.

18:21.057 --> 18:23.113
I'm not gonna come out of that
looking good.

18:23.290 --> 18:26.619
If you're really worried about her
being attracted to a better man...

18:26.788 --> 18:28.754
...why don't you become a better man?

18:28.922 --> 18:32.046
"Why don't you
become a better man?"

18:32.220 --> 18:34.515
Yeah, like that.

18:45.416 --> 18:48.109
You guys think
there are mountain lions up here?

18:48.282 --> 18:50.373
Hadn't given it much thought.

18:51.215 --> 18:53.203
Till just now.

18:53.381 --> 18:56.346
Relax, there's no mountain lions.

18:59.079 --> 19:02.840
You know, this is where it normally
goes bad in slasher movies.

19:04.744 --> 19:08.073
One guy falls back a little bit,
usually to smoke pot or have sex...

19:08.242 --> 19:10.571
...and then he gets his head
hacked off.

19:10.742 --> 19:14.264
Well, let that be a lesson to you
about drugs and premarital sex.

19:15.074 --> 19:17.665
- Good parenting, Alan.
- Thank you.

19:20.772 --> 19:22.896
Mountain lion! Mountain lion!

19:26.137 --> 19:28.897
Oh, crap. Hey, guys, wait up.

19:38.267 --> 19:39.755
Psych.

19:53.862 --> 19:57.759
I can't believe you really thought
I was a mountain lion.

19:58.094 --> 19:59.957
Go to your room.

20:00.127 --> 20:02.058
You punish me
because you're gullible?

20:02.492 --> 20:03.890
Yeah, pretty much.

20:08.590 --> 20:10.556
Still not funny!

20:15.389 --> 20:16.615
Chelsea's not home.

20:17.422 --> 20:20.251
How could she not be home?
That thing was over hours ago.

20:20.421 --> 20:22.386
Worried she might be cheating on you?

20:22.553 --> 20:25.383
No, I was thinking car trouble,
but thanks for that.

20:27.419 --> 20:28.850
Sorry.

20:29.284 --> 20:31.715
Chelsea and I have been
together for over a year.

20:31.884 --> 20:33.372
We're engaged to be married.

20:33.550 --> 20:36.140
What are the odds she's
gonna leave me for a lawyer...

20:36.315 --> 20:37.905
...because he's rich, handsome...

20:38.082 --> 20:41.070
...loves his family
and named a charity after his dead wife?

20:41.680 --> 20:43.111
I don't know. Even money?

20:44.047 --> 20:45.672
At least.

20:48.312 --> 20:50.436
So 10 bucks
just to make it interesting?

20:51.911 --> 20:53.536
Ouchie!

20:54.305 --> 21:00.882
