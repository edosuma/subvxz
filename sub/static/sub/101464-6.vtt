01:12.363 --> 01:16.242
-Is everyone okay?
-Is everyone...? [chuckles]

Yaz, wait!

01:19.537 --> 01:21.790
Wait! [grunts] Yasmina!

-[Yasmina] We're not okay!
-Yaz--

01:27.921 --> 01:31.633
We're in the middle of a jungle
with a monster dinosaur out there,

01:31.716 --> 01:32.759
and you...

01:34.928 --> 01:35.887
You...

01:36.387 --> 01:39.015
Destroyed our only way to get help
and lied about it!

01:39.098 --> 01:40.225
I told you guys!

01:40.475 --> 01:42.852
So, you did take Brooklynn's phone?

01:42.936 --> 01:44.687
Why? What were you doing?

01:44.771 --> 01:47.774
Probably trying to erase my video
of her taking those samples

01:47.857 --> 01:50.318
from the Sinoceratops. [gasps]

01:50.610 --> 01:52.904
And you knew about the Indominus rex

01:52.987 --> 01:56.825
because you were snooping around
Dr. Wu's office when I ran into you.

01:56.908 --> 01:59.494
-I knew it!
-I didn't mean to destroy the phone.

01:59.577 --> 02:01.704
I fell on it when the zipline
came down and--

02:01.788 --> 02:03.331
But you did steal it?

02:03.414 --> 02:06.084
You had it that whole time
and didn't tell us?

02:06.167 --> 02:09.295
Hold up. What were you doing
in Dr. Wu's office, Brooklynn?

02:09.921 --> 02:12.257
I... It doesn't matter.

02:12.340 --> 02:15.802
I didn't break our only way
to call for help and then lie about it!

02:15.885 --> 02:18.638
This is not my fault! This is her fault!

02:18.721 --> 02:19.889
-She--
-I'm here to spy!

02:24.394 --> 02:26.312
For a company called Mantah Corp.

02:26.729 --> 02:27.981
Mantah Corp?

02:28.606 --> 02:32.193
They're a bioengineering company,
big rivals with Masrani.

02:32.277 --> 02:34.988
They tried to make dinosaurs, too,
but Wu beat them to it.

02:35.071 --> 02:37.991
You doomed us all for some lousy company?

02:38.449 --> 02:39.617
Our ranch was in trouble,

02:39.701 --> 02:43.913
so my folks had to borrow a lot of money
from some shady people.

02:44.414 --> 02:46.916
We didn't know
they were fronting for Mantah Corp.

02:47.375 --> 02:51.004
They said we'd lose everything
unless I spied for them.

02:51.087 --> 02:54.883
Use the behind-the-scenes access I'd get
at camp to gather info from Wu's lab,

02:54.966 --> 02:58.761
and DNA from dinos,
and whatever else they needed.

02:59.178 --> 03:01.180
But then Brooklynn caught on,
and I got scared,

03:01.264 --> 03:04.767
and then everything went wrong.

03:06.144 --> 03:08.605
This is the last thing I wanted to happen.

03:08.938 --> 03:09.772
Oh. [scoffs]

03:09.856 --> 03:12.859
To be next to a broken van
on Killer Dinosaur Island?

03:12.942 --> 03:15.278
Hey, me, too! What are the odds?

03:15.486 --> 03:16.821
Yaz, I--

03:16.905 --> 03:19.991
Was it all a lie, wanting to be friends?

03:20.408 --> 03:22.160
Pretending you cared about...

03:24.037 --> 03:26.706
You just needed someone
to hide what you were doing.

03:26.956 --> 03:28.041
Tell me I'm wrong.

03:29.667 --> 03:30.627
[sobs]

03:31.836 --> 03:33.379
I'm such an idiot.

03:33.546 --> 03:34.797
[Sammy] You are wrong!

03:34.881 --> 03:37.800
I just didn't know how to say it,
how to explain to you.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.011
Just because I spied
doesn't change who I am.

03:40.094 --> 03:41.387
Don't touch me!

03:42.013 --> 03:43.473
Go away, Sammy.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.611
Not now, Bumpy.

03:57.111 --> 04:00.657
Look, I know the situation we're in
is suboptimal--

04:00.740 --> 04:03.618
It's trash. Just say it's trash, Ben.

04:03.868 --> 04:06.329
Yes, but despite
the obvious trashitude...

05:16.607 --> 05:18.234
-[tablet beeps]
-The Kayak River!

05:18.318 --> 05:21.112
The entrance is near here.
It goes underground, beneath the ridge.

05:21.195 --> 05:23.489
If we follow it, it'll take us
right to the main park.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.325

Hey! Dave here.

Sounds like you got
your hands full over there.

Tell you what--
if you let us borrow a park vehicle,

07:45.131 --> 07:47.175
we can just bring the kids in
ourselves, just--

If things are as bad as we think,

08:03.483 --> 08:06.736
there's no way rescuing six kids
is gonna be their top priority.

09:36.826 --> 09:40.329
I could have used my phone as a flashlight
if Sammy hadn't broken it.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.331
Of course, if we had my phone,
we wouldn't be here at all.

09:42.540 --> 09:45.376
Hey, will you stop harshing
the mellow of the CKK?

09:45.751 --> 09:47.753
How many times are you gonna say "CKK"?

09:47.837 --> 09:51.465
CKK? Why?
Would you like me to stop saying "CKK"?

09:51.549 --> 09:54.302
CKK. CKK. CKK.

09:54.385 --> 09:56.804
[sighs] You're acting like
this doesn't affect you, too.

09:56.887 --> 09:58.055
We're here because of her.

09:58.139 --> 10:00.641
Or maybe something else
would have happened

10:00.725 --> 10:02.643
and we would still be stuck here.

10:02.727 --> 10:04.979
Look, I-- I know you're mad at Sammy,

10:05.062 --> 10:06.939
but getting mad
doesn't get us out of here.

10:07.023 --> 10:09.817
It just makes more people mad, you know?

10:09.900 --> 10:11.569
Put yourself in her shoes.

10:11.819 --> 10:14.530
At this point, is there
anything you could say

10:14.614 --> 10:16.782
that would make Sammy feel worse
than she already does?

10:18.868 --> 10:20.786
Take it from someone
who has ample experience

10:20.870 --> 10:22.496
in rubbing people the wrong way.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.254
Just ask.

10:30.338 --> 10:34.467
It's just that you talk so much
about your ranch and your family.

10:34.759 --> 10:37.136
But your family sent you here
to break the law.

10:37.219 --> 10:39.972
Don't, Darius.
You don't know anything about my family.

10:40.056 --> 10:43.225
I know they put you in danger
when they sent you to spy on the park.

10:43.309 --> 10:44.977
How can you still defend them?

10:48.981 --> 10:50.566
Because they didn't send me.

10:52.568 --> 10:54.695
They said "no" to Mantah Corp.

10:54.779 --> 10:58.199
They said they'd rather lose everything
than use me like that.

10:58.741 --> 11:01.952
I was the one who contacted
the Mantah Corp agent.

11:02.036 --> 11:04.163
I agreed to come here.

11:04.246 --> 11:05.456
My family...

11:06.916 --> 11:10.294
they didn't even know what I was planning
until I was already on the ferry.

11:10.378 --> 11:14.298
Smashing the phone was an accident,
but Brooklynn's right--

11:14.507 --> 11:16.217
this is all my fault.

11:17.676 --> 11:19.595
I still don't see why--

11:19.678 --> 11:21.055
If your family was in trouble,

11:21.138 --> 11:23.933
wouldn't you do anything in your power
to save them?

11:26.143 --> 11:29.271
Ben, would you please put down
that overgrown turtle

11:29.355 --> 11:30.731
and pick up your paddle?

11:30.815 --> 11:32.650
I think Bumpy's seasick.

11:32.733 --> 11:34.276
I think you need to paddle!

11:34.693 --> 11:35.986
-[Bumpy groans]
-I think...

11:37.071 --> 11:40.032

and now she's upset!

12:10.604 --> 12:12.523
Ben, dinosaurs can't understand English!

12:12.606 --> 12:13.774
Well, I'm glad she can't,

12:14.150 --> 12:17.111
because there have been
several unkind things said.

13:13.083 --> 13:14.084
Hmm?

13:18.047 --> 13:21.008
[bellows]

13:28.057 --> 13:33.062
-Uh, cool kids to nerds, where are you?
-[Darius] Over here!

13:33.145 --> 13:35.481
I think something scared
the Parasaurolophuses.

13:35.773 --> 13:39.652
Darius, if we stopped paddling,
why are we still moving forward?

13:39.735 --> 13:40.778
[Darius gasps]

13:44.573 --> 13:47.576
[yelps] Paddle! There's a current
pulling us into a different tunnel.

13:47.660 --> 13:48.702
[grunting]

13:56.710 --> 13:58.462
[Darius] No! Guys!

13:58.546 --> 14:00.756
[all screaming]

14:06.512 --> 14:08.973
[screaming continues]

14:13.269 --> 14:15.062
[panting]

14:15.145 --> 14:16.522
-[boats thud]
-[Kenji grunts]

14:19.024 --> 14:22.945
-[Bumpy groaning]
-[sighs] We're okay. We're okay.

14:23.028 --> 14:26.198
-[Sammy laughs]
-[Bumpy squeals]

14:28.367 --> 14:30.369
What? [gasps]

14:30.619 --> 14:34.498
Why did you gasp?
It didn't sound like a good gasp!

14:34.582 --> 14:37.793
'Cause I know exactly where we are, guys.

14:38.002 --> 14:40.087
We're in the Jurassic World Lagoon.

14:40.963 --> 14:42.798
And so is the Mosasaurus.

14:43.048 --> 14:44.133
[both gasp]

14:48.804 --> 14:53.767
I assume the Mosasaurus
is some kind of giant fish dinosaur

14:53.851 --> 14:55.352
that's gonna try and eat us.

14:55.769 --> 14:58.355
-[yelps]
-[low growling]

15:01.483 --> 15:02.401
[whimpers]

15:09.283 --> 15:11.744
It's circling, testing us.

15:13.954 --> 15:15.831
It's acting like a shark.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.709
We're intruders in its domain,
so it's investigating us.

15:19.585 --> 15:23.422
Before it gets confident,
decides to... to...

15:23.505 --> 15:24.673
[snarling]

15:24.882 --> 15:25.883
-[whimpers]
-[squeals]

15:26.342 --> 15:28.552
-This is bad.
-We have to get out now!

15:28.844 --> 15:31.013
There's a ladder by the spectator stands.

15:31.388 --> 15:33.557
-[Kenji] How are we gonna--
-[whimpers] Y'all?

15:33.641 --> 15:35.935
[low growling]

15:36.018 --> 15:39.104
-Paddle! Go, go, go!
-[Sammy whimpering]

15:41.440 --> 15:43.400
This is not how Kenji wanted to go out!

15:43.484 --> 15:45.194
This isn't on my to-do list either!

15:45.402 --> 15:47.237
-[Brooklynn] Come on!
-[Darius] Hey!

15:49.156 --> 15:50.532
[Roxie] The kids must have gone in.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.576
The river leads to the main park, right?

15:53.786 --> 15:57.331
There's no way that'll pick up
their signal under all that rock.

15:57.414 --> 15:58.248
[Dave] I see 'em!

15:58.332 --> 16:01.627
They're not on the river anymore.
They're in Aquatic Area One.

16:04.129 --> 16:05.255
[tires screech]

16:07.591 --> 16:10.094
[pants, grunts]

16:10.177 --> 16:11.595
Keep paddling!

16:12.346 --> 16:13.472
Almost there!

16:19.228 --> 16:21.730
[squealing]

16:22.523 --> 16:23.732
[Yasmina gasps]

16:25.901 --> 16:28.570

16:29.196 --> 16:30.572
Don't look back!

16:41.917 --> 16:42.918
[Sammy screams]

16:43.502 --> 16:45.045
-[whimpers]
-[Darius] No!

16:45.629 --> 16:47.756
[both panting]

16:48.132 --> 16:49.049
No.

16:50.968 --> 16:51.885
[Ben panting]

16:52.011 --> 16:53.429
[Yasmina panting]

16:53.512 --> 16:55.097
Yaz, what are you doing?

16:55.889 --> 16:57.725
Whatever you do, don't stop paddling!

16:59.059 --> 17:00.811
[grunting]

17:00.894 --> 17:02.980
-Yasmina--
-Just keep paddling!

17:03.063 --> 17:06.233
[Sammy whimpering]

17:06.316 --> 17:08.318
-[Bumpy groans]
-[Ben grunts]

17:08.444 --> 17:09.570
Come on, faster!

17:09.778 --> 17:11.989
Don't look back, Sammy!
Just keep paddling!

17:12.072 --> 17:13.490
I'm trying!

17:13.574 --> 17:14.908
What's Yaz doing?

17:24.543 --> 17:25.753
[gasps, exhales]

17:26.211 --> 17:28.505
Hey! Hey! Over here!

17:28.589 --> 17:30.007
Hey!

17:30.299 --> 17:32.926
-[muffled thudding]
-[growls]

17:40.934 --> 17:42.061
-[Yasmina] Over here!
-[gasps]

17:42.728 --> 17:44.271
Here! Here!

17:45.022 --> 17:46.398
Yes! Here!

17:46.774 --> 17:49.526
She's distracting it, buying us time.
Keep going!

17:49.777 --> 17:50.986
[laughs]

17:51.070 --> 17:51.945
Yes!

17:52.029 --> 17:53.989
-Yes! She did it!
-Yes, Jaz!

18:00.245 --> 18:01.747
I did not think this through.

18:01.830 --> 18:03.207
We gotta do something!

18:03.290 --> 18:04.333
[whirring]

18:05.751 --> 18:07.753
-[gasps]
-Grab the chain!

18:10.506 --> 18:11.507
[grunts]

18:14.968 --> 18:16.512
-[Brooklynn] Go, go, go!
-[Ben] Yasmina!

18:19.640 --> 18:20.974
[grunts]

18:26.522 --> 18:27.356
No! [whimpers]

18:30.234 --> 18:31.443
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!

18:31.527 --> 18:32.611
Come on, Yaz!

18:36.115 --> 18:37.282
[grunts]

18:37.616 --> 18:39.034
-Oh, no...
-She's not gonna make it.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.912
[growling]

18:44.164 --> 18:47.209
[grunts, yells]

18:51.463 --> 18:54.258
[yelling continues]

18:54.341 --> 18:56.468
-[grunts]
-Yasmina!

18:56.677 --> 18:57.928
-[whimpers]
-[Yasmina groans]

18:59.304 --> 19:00.556
I'm okay.

19:02.307 --> 19:04.101
[grunts, pants]

19:04.184 --> 19:05.102
I think.

19:05.352 --> 19:08.021
Uh, also, where'd everyone go?

19:10.190 --> 19:15.028
[beeping fades]

19:18.240 --> 19:20.492
Rox, it's gone. The kids' signal is gone!

19:20.742 --> 19:23.328
It's probably just a glitch, right?
Reboot the system.

19:23.412 --> 19:25.038
Come on! Come on!

19:25.706 --> 19:27.249
Give me something! Give me something!

19:27.332 --> 19:29.835
-[tires screech]
-[dinosaurs screech]

19:32.796 --> 19:34.006
[tablet beeps]

19:34.214 --> 19:35.340
It's working.

19:35.424 --> 19:38.135
Their signal just stopped.

19:43.473 --> 19:46.560
[automated voice] <i>Wednesdays are</i>
<i>k-k-kids-eat-free days</i>

19:46.643 --> 19:49.479

19:54.651 --> 19:56.028
[Yasmina pants]

19:56.236 --> 19:59.198
[grunts, pants]

20:01.533 --> 20:03.952
Thank you for saving us,

20:04.036 --> 20:05.078
for saving me.

20:05.162 --> 20:07.414
That was amazing. You're amazing.

20:07.497 --> 20:08.498
Stop.

20:08.582 --> 20:09.625
[grunts]

20:10.250 --> 20:11.335
[sighs]

20:12.085 --> 20:13.670
We may need each other to stay alive,

20:13.754 --> 20:16.632
but don't for a second think
that makes us friends again.

20:17.049 --> 20:20.344
Because we're not and we will never be.

20:24.181 --> 20:26.433
[grunting]

20:40.030 --> 20:40.989
[Brooklynn] You okay?

20:45.953 --> 20:46.787
Naw.

20:47.287 --> 20:48.372
Not really.

20:48.872 --> 20:49.706
Yeah.

20:50.332 --> 20:51.458
Dumb question.

20:54.044 --> 20:58.090
I don't know her that well,
but I think if you give Yaz some space,

20:58.173 --> 20:59.258
she'll come around.

21:00.217 --> 21:01.093
Maybe?

21:01.843 --> 21:03.512
I don't know, I'm gonna be honest--

21:03.595 --> 21:06.848
IRL friendships
aren't really my thing, but, uh...

21:07.516 --> 21:08.684
sounds right, yeah?

21:10.394 --> 21:11.979
Why are you being so nice to me?

21:12.604 --> 21:14.773
Because Kenji is right.

21:15.023 --> 21:17.276
Ugh, that feels so wrong to say.

21:17.359 --> 21:19.861
Never, ever repeat that. Ugh. Gross.

21:20.821 --> 21:21.989
[sighs]

21:22.572 --> 21:25.701
Listen, I've done
my share of selfish things.

21:25.784 --> 21:30.664
I only knew what you were up to because
I was also sneaking in places I shouldn't.

21:31.999 --> 21:34.042
You were at least doing it for family.

21:34.126 --> 21:37.838
I was doing it to impress
a bunch of angry internet randos.

21:39.589 --> 21:43.593
Plus, when we get out of here,
you're gonna give me the exclusive

21:43.677 --> 21:46.388
on all the juicy details
of you spying for Mantah Corp.

21:46.471 --> 21:50.559
"Brooklynn Unboxes a Conspiracy."
Pow, pow!

21:50.642 --> 21:54.813
Try to tell me my videos are lame
after that, angry internet randos!

21:55.689 --> 21:57.065
-[giggles]
-So...

21:58.317 --> 21:59.151
deal?

22:00.485 --> 22:01.320
Deal.

22:02.446 --> 22:05.615
So, not to be a total downer,

22:05.699 --> 22:09.536
but Operation Find People
to Help Us is, heh...

22:10.662 --> 22:12.122
clearly a bust.

22:17.127 --> 22:19.296
My dad talked about coming here for years.

22:19.880 --> 22:21.048
And here we are.

22:22.132 --> 22:23.383
[Kenji] Yep.

22:24.051 --> 22:26.053
Welcome to Jurassic World.
