00:17.770 --> 00:20.779
- My side is expecting me home.
- Meaning we're fucked.

00:20.780 --> 00:22.840
Not if we send this
one back in my place.

00:24.080 --> 00:25.470
Ugh.

00:27.880 --> 00:29.329
You failed a drug test.

00:29.330 --> 00:32.009
You know that's not what this is.

00:32.009 --> 00:34.399
Dad! I know you're
in there. Open the door.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.889
You're phone's been off all
day. Mom's in the hospital.

00:36.890 --> 00:38.929
- We've got to go. Come on.
- Mom?

00:38.930 --> 00:41.319
Perhaps it'll be
simpler if we introduce ourselves.

00:41.320 --> 00:42.599
I'm Emily.

00:42.600 --> 00:44.479
You're better than him.

00:44.480 --> 00:47.480
Your assassin friend...
They want her removed.

00:47.490 --> 00:48.729
She trusts me.

00:48.730 --> 00:50.339
Perhaps it's time you actually

00:50.340 --> 00:52.540
use that situation to your advantage.

00:56.940 --> 00:59.819
You know anything about
this group Pope is working with?

00:59.820 --> 01:02.469
Fanatics. Inside our office.

01:02.470 --> 01:05.498
He's been helping 'em move
illegals. A long time now.

01:05.500 --> 01:08.689
They want to bring over our
guests earlier than expected.

01:08.690 --> 01:11.190
Something's about to
happen. Something big.

02:08.070 --> 02:09.348
Purpose of visit?

02:09.350 --> 02:11.310
Maintenance for the embassy.

02:28.990 --> 02:30.240
Enjoy your stay.

Howard.

06:47.390 --> 06:49.050
Have you been taking lessons?

06:55.240 --> 06:56.709
It's a red-letter day.

06:56.710 --> 06:58.550
You may actually have your first win.

06:59.120 --> 07:00.810
It only took you two months.

07:06.840 --> 07:08.130
You got this.

07:11.350 --> 07:12.900
Sequence is right there.

07:21.910 --> 07:23.750
I'm afraid that was a mistake.

07:30.360 --> 07:32.550
You were so close this time.

07:48.860 --> 07:51.740
Is there a reason you're not walking
out into the hall right now?

08:10.880 --> 08:12.859
You couldn't just drop
some intel in a locker

08:12.860 --> 08:15.780
or send a simple cipher, like
any other person, could you?

08:16.830 --> 08:18.600
No, with you, I get...

08:19.860 --> 08:21.620
these letters.

08:23.220 --> 08:25.100
Like, uh...

08:25.820 --> 08:27.500
Rilke, here.

08:27.980 --> 08:30.570
And I can't make heads
or tails of that guy.

08:36.700 --> 08:38.359
All these years with you,

08:38.360 --> 08:39.780
I'm still out in the cold.

09:22.640 --> 09:24.160
Please sit.

09:33.560 --> 09:35.480
Two men came to you recently.

09:36.650 --> 09:38.529
Get a lot of customers here.

09:38.530 --> 09:39.990
Not this kind.

09:41.350 --> 09:43.759
One of these men is an
agent of this world,

09:43.760 --> 09:45.489
the other's from ours.

09:45.490 --> 09:47.100
His name's Howard Silk.

09:47.960 --> 09:49.710
I'd like to know what he was asking.

09:51.650 --> 09:53.050
I don't remember.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.400
Is this routine for you?

09:58.340 --> 10:00.100
To betray your own kind?

10:04.950 --> 10:07.809
You must be with the people
Alexander Pope's consorting with.

10:07.810 --> 10:09.830
What do they call it? Um...

10:11.130 --> 10:12.630
the School.

10:20.350 --> 10:22.220
Heard rumors about that place.

10:36.620 --> 10:38.490
What'd you tell Howard Silk?

10:42.180 --> 10:43.950
It won't make a difference, will it?

10:44.390 --> 10:46.619
If you somehow compromised
me or my associates,

10:46.620 --> 10:48.670
there are things that
must be made right.

10:53.780 --> 10:55.250
When I tell you...

10:56.810 --> 10:57.840
what happens?

10:59.300 --> 11:01.300
You've already chosen your side.

11:03.450 --> 11:04.830
A decade here,

11:05.390 --> 11:07.310
three at home... Know what I know?

11:08.340 --> 11:10.030
There are no sides.

11:13.070 --> 11:14.810
We all go to the same hell.

11:29.940 --> 11:32.070
Oh...

11:37.090 --> 11:38.370
You want Anna?

11:39.190 --> 11:41.369
Yes. Yeah. Um...

11:41.370 --> 11:43.339
- You know who I am?
- Yeah.

11:43.340 --> 11:45.190
From pictures.

11:46.530 --> 11:49.199
And you're... a boyfriend?

11:49.200 --> 11:51.309
Living together?

11:51.310 --> 11:53.419
- How long has that been...
- Anna's on a shift.

11:53.420 --> 11:54.949
Oh, okay.

11:54.950 --> 11:58.649
Um... could you tell me where, please?

11:58.650 --> 12:00.459
I'd-I'd really like to speak with her.

12:00.460 --> 12:02.610
Maybe leave her alone, huh?

12:03.610 --> 12:05.059
I'm her father.

12:06.140 --> 12:07.780
That's not what I hear.

12:13.290 --> 12:14.460
Okay.

12:15.570 --> 12:17.739
Will you please tell her I stopped by?

12:17.740 --> 12:18.850
Okay.

13:18.590 --> 13:20.370
What do you think of the view?

13:22.390 --> 13:25.090
Different, I imagine,
where you come from.

13:27.870 --> 13:31.060
There's no need for
pretense with me, Howard.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.750
I know so much about you.

13:36.310 --> 13:38.859
I know your other sent
you here in his place

13:38.860 --> 13:40.960
as a result of his being...

13:41.460 --> 13:43.580
grounded by the embassy.

13:49.090 --> 13:52.600
He didn't tell you about me, did he?

13:54.690 --> 13:56.170
No.

13:57.020 --> 13:59.730
My name is Alexander Pope.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.049
And you, dear boy,

14:02.050 --> 14:05.050
are nothing like our mutual friend.

14:08.010 --> 14:09.020
You...

14:09.620 --> 14:11.120
you work for the Office?

14:12.270 --> 14:14.020
They call me a runner.

14:15.560 --> 14:17.330
I-I don't know what that is.

14:17.840 --> 14:20.729
It means that, some years
ago, I took a man like you

14:20.730 --> 14:23.570
and made him into a
man like Howard Silk.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.200
So...

14:27.820 --> 14:30.950
I should say, what, job well done?

14:32.870 --> 14:36.610
I understand you've been spending
some time with his family.

14:38.830 --> 14:40.020
That's right.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.130
Let me guess,

14:44.090 --> 14:46.610
he didn't tell you about them either.

14:49.390 --> 14:51.090
It's in his nature.

14:51.100 --> 14:54.249
Perhaps he didn't want you
mucking around in his affairs.

14:54.250 --> 14:55.829
On that subject though,

14:55.830 --> 14:58.699
if I may offer you a word of advice,

14:58.700 --> 15:02.790
you really shouldn't be placing
any trust in that woman.

15:03.570 --> 15:04.750
Emily?

15:05.610 --> 15:08.809
I can't speak for what
she's like on your side,

15:08.810 --> 15:12.339
but this one ruined him.

15:12.340 --> 15:14.540
And I wouldn't want the same
thing happening to you.

15:16.470 --> 15:18.710
Maybe you don't really know her.

15:20.290 --> 15:21.580
No.

15:23.970 --> 15:25.310
Maybe you're right.

15:27.880 --> 15:31.320
I just thought I'd warn you
as a gesture of good faith.

15:32.490 --> 15:34.010
Don't be shy, Howard.

15:34.810 --> 15:38.560
If you ever need anything, just
drop a letter on the lamppost.

15:40.090 --> 15:43.290
You haven't the faintest idea
what I'm talking about, have you?

15:44.900 --> 15:46.479
He was right...

15:46.480 --> 15:48.380
You're so plain.

15:49.920 --> 15:53.940
Why don't you ask Emily
about my signal plan?

15:55.680 --> 15:59.010
Might surprise you what you
don't know about that woman.

16:20.270 --> 16:23.270
Working on a Saturday, Mr. Quayle?

17:04.010 --> 17:06.759
Just found a few contraband items.

17:06.760 --> 17:08.079
No alarms.

17:08.790 --> 17:10.628
You're certain?

17:10.630 --> 17:12.640
You know, it might be
helpful if you told me

17:12.660 --> 17:13.960
exactly what we're looking for.

17:21.680 --> 17:24.560
Before Silk left, he asked
me to follow up on a lead.

17:27.020 --> 17:28.590
So I met a source.

17:29.550 --> 17:32.400
A man who knows about the
people funding Baldwin.

17:34.010 --> 17:35.440
And what did he say?

17:37.050 --> 17:38.610
He mentioned a mole.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.399
Here?

17:40.400 --> 17:41.460
Third floor.

17:41.470 --> 17:42.729
High level.

17:42.730 --> 17:45.569
I know every point of
exposure from this floor.

17:45.570 --> 17:47.599
If there's a leak, it's controlled.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.230
He said it was high clearance.

17:49.970 --> 17:51.809
There's only a few people that could be.

17:51.810 --> 17:54.429
You, me,

17:54.430 --> 17:56.130
any one of your boys.

18:04.590 --> 18:08.689
How long did your source say
this mole has been in place?

18:08.690 --> 18:10.290
He said years.

18:16.130 --> 18:19.110
Come with me. We're going for a drive.

20:27.570 --> 20:30.730
I'm sorry to just
come over like this, but...

20:31.540 --> 20:34.950
I met a man today named Alexander Pope.

20:37.440 --> 20:39.190
Oh, yeah? What did he want?

20:40.360 --> 20:42.860
He told me I shouldn't trust you.

20:46.090 --> 20:48.040
Well, that's rich, coming from him.

20:51.540 --> 20:53.749
Look, I...

20:53.750 --> 20:56.229
Got to be honest... I-I don't know

20:56.230 --> 20:59.429
how this game is played, but...

20:59.430 --> 21:03.020
it's obvious that things over here

21:03.040 --> 21:06.470
with you are not exactly
as they are over there

21:06.480 --> 21:08.510
with my Emily.

21:10.550 --> 21:14.579
Look, Howard, I really don't
think you and I should discuss

21:14.580 --> 21:15.879
your other life. I...

21:15.880 --> 21:17.349
Please.

21:17.350 --> 21:19.379
My Emily is a clerk.

21:19.380 --> 21:21.819
It's pretty evident that you're not.

21:21.820 --> 21:23.089
I want to know

21:23.090 --> 21:25.850
how you became so different.

21:25.860 --> 21:27.959
Okay.

21:27.960 --> 21:29.789
Go ahead.

21:29.790 --> 21:31.190
Ask.

21:34.660 --> 21:36.270
You do what he does?

21:37.580 --> 21:39.999
I work in Strategy.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.099
Counterintelligence.

21:41.100 --> 21:42.809
It's a different department,

21:42.810 --> 21:44.510
but it's close.

21:46.630 --> 21:47.690
How long?

21:48.430 --> 21:49.660
Since we met?

21:50.530 --> 21:52.180
How long have you been married?

21:53.020 --> 21:54.410
28 years.

21:58.410 --> 21:59.959
I don't know all the ways

21:59.960 --> 22:02.360
our lives were different
back then, but...

22:03.590 --> 22:05.380
the woman you married...

22:07.200 --> 22:09.070
loved you very much.

22:11.540 --> 22:13.250
Where is she now?

22:14.580 --> 22:16.139
About six weeks ago,

22:16.140 --> 22:18.109
she was walking across the street

22:18.110 --> 22:20.830
and she was hit by a car.

22:22.380 --> 22:23.579
And a few days ago,

22:23.580 --> 22:26.480
an assassin came to try
to finish the job.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.320
Were you...

22:30.250 --> 22:32.970
really hospitalized for a drug overdose?

22:34.590 --> 22:36.030
No.

22:37.680 --> 22:40.430
Someone... did that to you.

22:40.440 --> 22:41.929
Someone tried to kill you.

22:41.930 --> 22:44.790
Yes. His name is Alexander Pope.

22:47.820 --> 22:50.530
The man your other trusts,
much to his detriment.

22:54.930 --> 22:57.460
There's another name...
C-Claude Lambert.

22:58.330 --> 23:00.180
Does that name mean anything to you?

23:00.950 --> 23:02.130
Why do you ask?

23:03.210 --> 23:06.419
My other said that he believes

23:06.420 --> 23:08.180
he's involved in this, too.

23:11.030 --> 23:12.930
The embassy's compromised.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.430
How can I help?

23:22.490 --> 23:24.439
Emily, please, you said there are ways

23:24.440 --> 23:26.250
we could help each other.

23:27.230 --> 23:30.210
Somebody out there is
trying to kill my wife.

24:27.930 --> 24:29.310
Toast and espresso.

24:29.640 --> 24:32.170
Toast and espresso.

24:32.180 --> 24:33.439
Easy.

24:33.440 --> 24:34.820
Ein Espresso.

24:53.030 --> 24:54.590
Espresso...

24:59.400 --> 25:00.920
...toast...

25:02.070 --> 25:04.769
...and soup of the day.

25:04.770 --> 25:06.409
No, I...

25:06.410 --> 25:08.039
I didn't order soup.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.309
Oh, yeah. Right.

25:09.310 --> 25:11.730
My mistake.

25:13.070 --> 25:14.220
Keep it.

25:14.870 --> 25:16.400
Goes well with the toast.

25:53.070 --> 25:55.059
A lot of security.

25:55.060 --> 25:56.399
It's to keep eyes away.

25:56.400 --> 25:58.029
Who exactly is this woman?

25:58.030 --> 25:59.459
Her name is Alice.

25:59.460 --> 26:01.760
She's a defector from the other side.

26:01.770 --> 26:03.899
Used to be a secretary in Strategy.

26:03.900 --> 26:06.050
What, you just let her live here?

26:07.570 --> 26:09.339
She had valuable information.

26:09.340 --> 26:10.770
Well, we gave her a life.

26:11.360 --> 26:12.650
I'll do the talking.

26:27.480 --> 26:29.389
Mausi.

26:29.390 --> 26:30.810
You didn't call.

26:32.580 --> 26:34.159
They tried.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.560
You didn't pick up.

26:35.570 --> 26:36.869
Oh, the winter garden.

26:36.870 --> 26:38.129
I was in the winter garden.

26:38.130 --> 26:39.280
We have one now.

26:40.200 --> 26:42.039
Herbert is terrible with the planting,

26:42.040 --> 26:44.310
but we have tomatoes in the winter.

26:45.430 --> 26:46.880
Red Tea.

26:47.770 --> 26:49.209
Mausi, you didn't.

26:51.800 --> 26:53.249
We should celebrate.

26:53.250 --> 26:55.240
I already hear the kettle.

26:57.170 --> 26:59.919
What's that, contraband?

27:10.830 --> 27:12.960
That smell.

27:13.670 --> 27:15.380
I've almost forgotten.

27:16.170 --> 27:17.869
You know, we took the seed,

27:17.870 --> 27:20.590
tried to grow it here,
but you just can't.

27:21.650 --> 27:24.180
The soil over here is so arid.

27:27.270 --> 27:29.080
Thank you.

27:36.620 --> 27:39.020
So how are things at the Office?

27:40.900 --> 27:42.240
I miss it.

27:43.600 --> 27:46.990
Said to her the other
day, "I miss the game."

27:48.280 --> 27:50.670
- How is she?
- Oh, she's fine.

27:51.180 --> 27:52.540
We're fine.

27:53.960 --> 27:55.600
But you're not, I think.

27:56.670 --> 27:58.260
Coming all this way.

28:01.050 --> 28:02.889
Do you remember when you came over,

28:02.890 --> 28:04.749
what you said to my men

28:04.750 --> 28:07.270
in Housekeeping, on our side?

28:09.940 --> 28:11.520
Has something happened?

28:13.010 --> 28:14.790
There have been some developments.

28:15.230 --> 28:17.050
Recently? Something new?

28:18.440 --> 28:20.670
It's possible we've been compromised.

28:24.090 --> 28:25.840
A leak in Housekeeping?

28:26.660 --> 28:28.390
Could be all of Strategy.

28:33.150 --> 28:36.180
Mausi, are you certain
that it's so high up?

28:36.190 --> 28:37.740
Yes.

28:39.610 --> 28:41.190
Yes, we're quite certain.

28:41.780 --> 28:43.680
You think that I was right.

28:45.260 --> 28:47.009
That's why you've come to me.

28:47.010 --> 28:48.409
I don't know.

28:48.410 --> 28:51.699
I told your men, I swore on it.

28:51.700 --> 28:54.169
It's important that we don't
make any conclusions just yet,

28:54.170 --> 28:56.079
- we're just talking.
- No.

28:56.080 --> 28:57.939
It must be them.

28:57.940 --> 28:59.629
If the leak is so high.

28:59.630 --> 29:01.520
If there's a mole, it has to be.

29:01.530 --> 29:03.430
Has to be who?

29:05.670 --> 29:07.679
Welcome.

29:07.680 --> 29:10.349
Try the mint. Fresh.

29:10.350 --> 29:11.719
Dear.

29:11.720 --> 29:13.689
- The roast?
- In the oven.

29:13.690 --> 29:15.640
The heat, not too high.

29:16.900 --> 29:18.400
Yes, yes.

29:22.150 --> 29:24.360
He always burns the roast.

29:25.480 --> 29:28.110
So handsome, but a terrible cook.

29:31.350 --> 29:35.209
Mausi, I tried to believe your men.

29:35.210 --> 29:36.440
I really did.

29:36.450 --> 29:39.460
It would be better if I
was only fooling myself.

29:39.860 --> 29:41.660
That they didn't really exist.

29:43.750 --> 29:45.590
Who the hell are we talking about?

29:50.510 --> 29:52.989
If Lambert is
somehow involved in all this,

29:52.990 --> 29:55.479
he must be receiving
orders from our side.

29:55.480 --> 29:58.589
So we're looking for
Edgar Brandt, a courier,

29:58.590 --> 30:00.869
who brings the embassy
pouch back and forth.

30:00.870 --> 30:04.050
So how do we go about this?

30:05.070 --> 30:07.530
You happen to be his role model.

30:09.480 --> 30:11.470
So you want me to talk to him?

30:11.980 --> 30:13.600
Well, you did offer to help.

30:17.330 --> 30:19.860
Does nobody shop around here?

30:20.730 --> 30:22.440
Ever since I got to this side,

30:23.160 --> 30:25.760
public places, inside, outside,

30:26.460 --> 30:28.630
the whole city seems so vacant.

30:29.220 --> 30:30.869
He really didn't tell you anything

30:30.870 --> 30:32.200
about our world, did he?

30:33.120 --> 30:36.160
There was a flu epidemic
in the early '90s.

30:37.290 --> 30:40.440
It was a fever that escalated quickly.

30:41.210 --> 30:42.609
Within four years,

30:42.610 --> 30:44.940
seven percent of the
population was wiped out.

30:46.220 --> 30:48.450
Seven percent of your
world's population?

30:48.460 --> 30:49.780
Yeah.

30:50.980 --> 30:53.740
God. That's-that's like
half a billion people.

30:55.410 --> 30:57.190
Yeah, we almost lost Anna.

31:03.080 --> 31:04.960
She was just a little girl,

31:06.460 --> 31:08.300
and in the hospital for months.

31:09.470 --> 31:11.089
Howard was a mess.

31:11.090 --> 31:15.809
I just... I was paralyzed.

31:15.810 --> 31:17.510
Couldn't even go to the hospital.

31:19.830 --> 31:21.640
Is-is that when you started?

31:23.170 --> 31:25.170
Just the pills at the beginning.

31:26.130 --> 31:27.630
Anna got better,

31:30.220 --> 31:32.180
but... everything else got worse.

31:39.050 --> 31:42.060
I can tell by the way you look at me...

31:43.570 --> 31:46.030
that you hold her in high regard.

31:48.690 --> 31:51.170
She, uh, she had her rough times.

31:51.650 --> 31:53.719
Edinburgh. Yes.

31:53.720 --> 31:55.430
I remember some of it.

32:00.010 --> 32:02.640
And what about, uh, Ian?

32:04.850 --> 32:07.259
Will you tell him about-about this?

32:07.260 --> 32:08.359
No.

32:08.360 --> 32:09.940
He's not the sort of person

32:09.960 --> 32:11.860
who would understand this, believe me.

32:14.280 --> 32:15.890
You two are happy?

32:21.740 --> 32:23.220
That's him.

32:24.640 --> 32:26.769
Okay, all you have to do

32:26.770 --> 32:28.679
is to find out the delivery address

32:28.680 --> 32:30.249
of the pouch.

32:30.250 --> 32:33.239
We find that, we find out
who Lambert's working with.

32:33.240 --> 32:34.530
Right.

32:35.890 --> 32:37.040
Don't worry.

32:37.990 --> 32:40.060
You'll be fine. I'll be, I'll be nearby.

32:41.890 --> 32:43.160
Sure.

34:54.150 --> 34:57.070
I tell you about this girl
I've been seeing over there?

34:57.700 --> 34:59.029
She's a lawyer.

34:59.030 --> 35:00.739
I know her on this side, too.

35:00.740 --> 35:02.239
All buttoned-up and quiet.

35:02.240 --> 35:03.500
But over there...

35:04.440 --> 35:07.790
You know, it's crazy they both make
the same sound when they finish.

35:08.200 --> 35:11.579
It's like kittens trapped
in a closet, you know?

35:15.420 --> 35:18.140
I want to talk about Claude Lambert.

35:19.090 --> 35:21.160
And some people he's working with.

35:23.840 --> 35:26.290
You're-you're moving pouches
for the embassy, right?

35:26.860 --> 35:28.260
For Lambert?

35:29.000 --> 35:31.669
Bringing them over to this side

35:31.670 --> 35:33.600
to a specific location?

35:35.100 --> 35:36.740
Maybe it's best we don't talk about

35:36.750 --> 35:38.020
all kinds of shit, you know?

35:41.660 --> 35:44.449
These people, they're connected
everywhere. Every floor.

35:44.450 --> 35:45.950
Our side and theirs.

35:46.600 --> 35:48.270
Could be you, this could be a test.

35:51.710 --> 35:53.280
I think I need another drink.

35:53.680 --> 35:54.700
You need something?

36:36.520 --> 36:37.830
Oh, fuck.

36:38.870 --> 36:40.210
Hello, Edgar.

36:40.760 --> 36:42.740
You left without paying for your drink.

36:46.550 --> 36:48.300
You two are working together?

36:51.950 --> 36:53.810
See how quiet he is?

36:55.450 --> 36:57.519
I think he's afraid for
your safety, Edgar.

36:57.520 --> 36:58.819
Now, look.

36:58.820 --> 37:00.579
We both know

37:00.580 --> 37:02.869
I have no fucking clue what's going on.

37:02.870 --> 37:04.739
There is no need for
that sort of language.

37:04.740 --> 37:06.379
Someone tried to have me
killed the other night.

37:06.380 --> 37:08.059
I'd like to know who that was.

37:08.060 --> 37:09.820
Who's Lambert consorting with?

37:10.770 --> 37:12.219
I don't know who the pouch goes to.

37:12.220 --> 37:13.699
It's just some fucking house.

37:13.700 --> 37:15.649
- A house?
- Yes, a house.

37:15.650 --> 37:17.359
A mansion, it's two hours out of town.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.399
- Who lives in the mansion?
- Are you kidding me?

37:19.400 --> 37:22.210
They-they don't even let
us pull up the driveway.

37:26.470 --> 37:28.680
I need the address, Edgar.

37:33.140 --> 37:34.370
Potsdam.

37:34.830 --> 37:37.889
Five kilometers past
town. 47 Linchstrasse.

37:37.890 --> 37:39.900
Thank you. You may go.

37:55.990 --> 37:58.909
You understand,
the Office where I come from,

37:58.910 --> 38:00.990
we don't have the same
structure as you do.

38:01.650 --> 38:03.810
In Strategy, there's a
board of directors.

38:04.290 --> 38:06.019
They share power,

38:06.020 --> 38:08.039
and they've been know to
fight from time to time.

38:08.040 --> 38:09.520
Yeah, I'm familiar with it.

38:09.530 --> 38:10.659
Just before I left,

38:10.660 --> 38:12.849
there was a dispute
among these directors.

38:12.850 --> 38:15.959
There was a man, very young,

38:15.960 --> 38:17.770
had a proposal to exert

38:18.420 --> 38:21.800
"quiet influence" on your side.

38:23.470 --> 38:25.070
What does that mean?

38:26.560 --> 38:27.990
It's a black operation.

38:28.470 --> 38:31.410
Low profile. Long term in its impact.

38:32.180 --> 38:34.159
They called this program "Indigo."

38:34.160 --> 38:36.579
And what is that?
It's a network of some kind?

38:36.580 --> 38:38.700
- No.
- School.

38:39.190 --> 38:40.230
A school?

38:40.620 --> 38:44.610
For children. They're chosen,
trained, soldiers for their side.

38:45.030 --> 38:47.220
They grow up and are placed here

38:47.800 --> 38:50.309
on your side, as sleeper agents.

38:50.310 --> 38:52.280
And management on your
side approved this?

38:52.290 --> 38:53.729
Management never knew.

38:53.730 --> 38:55.369
It came from private money.

38:55.370 --> 38:57.969
- Whose?
- Fanatics.

38:57.970 --> 38:59.269
Within the Office.

38:59.270 --> 39:01.600
They hate your side for
what you've done to ours.

39:03.760 --> 39:05.309
Wait, th-the flu?

39:05.310 --> 39:06.980
Is she, is she talking about...?

39:07.730 --> 39:09.420
This is ridiculous.

39:09.430 --> 39:11.779
Your side knows we had no part in that.

39:11.780 --> 39:14.489
It's a conspiracy theory.
It's been disproven.

39:14.490 --> 39:16.909
Not to them, not to many.

39:16.910 --> 39:19.510
There have been some
assassinations recently.

39:19.520 --> 39:21.130
People of interest.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.520
It seems strategic. Targeted.

39:24.530 --> 39:28.399
Mausi, this is exactly something
Shadow would arrange.

39:28.400 --> 39:29.960
Who's Shadow?

39:32.000 --> 39:35.730
Tell me what you told my
men, exactly as you said it.

39:38.660 --> 39:41.749
Five years ago, I heard a discussion

39:41.750 --> 39:45.339
a-about a vacancy in your
Office, one they had created.

39:45.340 --> 39:47.649
- So, they created a vacancy.
- Yes.

39:47.650 --> 39:50.009
A high-traffic position, director level.

39:50.010 --> 39:51.489
They were going to expedite

39:51.490 --> 39:53.779
the arrival of an agent called Shadow.

39:53.780 --> 39:55.599
So that's our mole?

39:55.600 --> 39:57.489
- Which department?
- I don't know.

39:57.490 --> 39:59.949
Y-You must know something,
just anything, details.

39:59.950 --> 40:01.450
No. I wish I did.

40:06.430 --> 40:07.470
Mausi,

40:08.210 --> 40:10.280
if Shadow is real,

40:11.460 --> 40:13.240
everything is compromised.

40:13.870 --> 40:15.220
All of our secrecy.

40:15.990 --> 40:17.160
Even us.

40:21.710 --> 40:23.759
Is that Mausi's car I see?

40:23.760 --> 40:25.540
Hello, dear.

40:27.480 --> 40:28.999
You didn't call.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.219
Oh, he did. We were
in the winter garden.

40:31.220 --> 40:33.190
How was your walk?

40:33.200 --> 40:34.430
Good.

40:35.130 --> 40:36.570
I saw an owl.

40:36.580 --> 40:38.879
The smallest, most beautiful owl.

40:38.880 --> 40:40.109
Splendid.

40:40.110 --> 40:42.719
- Did you see the fox?
- No, not today.

40:42.720 --> 40:44.869
We've had a visitor lately.

40:44.870 --> 40:47.130
Yeah. Small little fox tracks.

40:48.320 --> 40:50.119
Dear, the roast.

40:50.120 --> 40:51.339
Already in the oven.

40:51.340 --> 40:52.940
Yeah. The heat, not too high.

40:55.170 --> 40:56.300
Yes, yes.

41:00.200 --> 41:02.629
He always burns the roast.

41:02.630 --> 41:04.850
So handsome but a terrible cook.

41:06.270 --> 41:07.650
You stay for supper?

41:08.840 --> 41:10.809
Can't. We should be going.

41:10.810 --> 41:12.399
We've taken too much of your time.

41:12.400 --> 41:14.109
Oh, please. Come on, stay.

41:14.110 --> 41:15.609
Too much work.

41:15.610 --> 41:17.000
But thank you.

41:19.570 --> 41:21.410
Don't work too hard.

41:22.150 --> 41:23.730
Mausi.

41:25.340 --> 41:26.710
Are we safe?

41:29.840 --> 41:31.090
Always.

41:41.250 --> 41:42.470
Interesting setup.

41:43.290 --> 41:46.600
When she crossed over, she
wanted to meet her other.

41:47.250 --> 41:48.450
And they got along.

41:53.620 --> 41:54.740
Shadow?

41:55.750 --> 41:58.130
Your men knew about
this this whole time,

41:58.490 --> 41:59.910
and they just sat on it.

42:00.470 --> 42:01.680
If he exists,

42:02.120 --> 42:03.150
I'll find him.

42:28.880 --> 42:30.179
H-Howard?

42:30.180 --> 42:32.769
Sister in the hospital? What
a fucking load of shit.

42:32.770 --> 42:35.050
- Who do you work for? What floor?
- I-I...

42:35.060 --> 42:36.919
You've been colluding with Emily,

42:36.920 --> 42:38.420
hiding her research here.

42:38.430 --> 42:40.459
- What-what is that?
- Please don't insult

42:40.460 --> 42:42.789
my intelligence. I'm not the
fucking nobody you think I am.

42:42.790 --> 42:44.109
Start talking.

42:44.110 --> 42:45.790
I didn't know she was married.

42:50.190 --> 42:51.860
I'm sorry, Howard, I...

42:54.780 --> 42:57.420
By the time she told me, I was...

42:58.700 --> 42:59.740
already...

43:05.880 --> 43:07.250
How long?

43:11.990 --> 43:14.480
We were seeing each other ten months.

43:16.560 --> 43:18.220
Then the accident happened.

43:19.370 --> 43:21.439
I saw you at the hospital

43:21.440 --> 43:23.610
and made up the story about my sister.

43:28.170 --> 43:29.700
You're a fucking civilian.

43:30.550 --> 43:33.820
Howard, why are you carrying a gun?

43:41.670 --> 43:43.800
- I'm despicable.
- I'm sorry.

43:49.820 --> 43:51.200
You love her?

43:53.920 --> 43:56.050
Please don't hurt me.

43:59.930 --> 44:01.740
And she loves you?

44:03.030 --> 44:04.560
I'm sorry.

44:44.480 --> 44:46.589
I hope your trip went smoothly.

44:46.590 --> 44:48.419
These are your orders.

44:48.420 --> 44:49.950
Relevant details.

44:50.810 --> 44:52.600
Everything you need is in there.

45:03.600 --> 45:05.710
What about the personal effects?

45:06.390 --> 45:08.140
You'll get them when
your marks are dead.

45:08.810 --> 45:10.430
They're still alive?

45:10.910 --> 45:12.910
There have been complications.

45:12.920 --> 45:14.449
Problems with our assassin.

45:14.450 --> 45:16.900
I'm working on it. You'll
have to be patient.

45:29.700 --> 45:31.389
I was in the year behind you.

45:31.390 --> 45:32.700
We never met.

45:33.260 --> 45:35.200
She talks about you all the time.

45:39.080 --> 45:40.790
It's an honor.

45:46.970 --> 45:49.510
I'll be in touch with
additional instructions.

48:10.640 --> 48:14.180
You know, it's probably best if
you don't stay another night.

48:14.860 --> 48:16.349
Right. Yeah.

48:16.350 --> 48:17.950
Probably best.

48:20.890 --> 48:23.500
I'm not her, Howard.

48:24.230 --> 48:25.970
I mean, there's a lot we share, but...

48:27.210 --> 48:28.860
there's a lot we don't.

48:30.590 --> 48:32.820
Don't look for things that aren't there.

48:35.970 --> 48:37.970
Do you think it's possible to...

48:38.540 --> 48:40.620
truly love someone

48:42.560 --> 48:45.380
without ever knowing
who they really are?

48:48.710 --> 48:50.220
Maybe we don't...

48:51.130 --> 48:53.300
love someone for who they really are.

48:55.620 --> 48:57.850
Maybe love is seeing them...

48:58.870 --> 49:00.640
for who they'd rather be.

49:05.980 --> 49:07.690
Good night.

49:08.780 --> 49:10.000
Good night.

49:22.250 --> 49:23.799
So,

49:23.800 --> 49:26.220
found your little stash.

49:28.120 --> 49:29.519
That was a good idea,

49:29.520 --> 49:31.440
hiding it with the nerdy professor.

49:36.760 --> 49:39.159
Would've been nice to
think he was just a mark,

49:39.160 --> 49:42.019
but, uh...

49:42.020 --> 49:44.320
apparently it was more than that.

49:54.350 --> 49:55.950
I thought you were better.

50:04.820 --> 50:06.600
Thanks for the intel.

50:38.150 --> 50:40.170
Can I get you anything?

50:44.800 --> 50:46.180
You get robbed lately?

50:47.310 --> 50:48.919
Oh. Uh...

50:48.920 --> 50:50.560
It's a long story, but no.

50:53.110 --> 50:55.540
Have a seat.

51:06.100 --> 51:07.989
Marko says you stopped by.

51:07.990 --> 51:09.890
Yeah. I, um...

51:10.390 --> 51:12.650
just wanted to see if
you were all right.

51:13.800 --> 51:15.110
What is this?

51:16.560 --> 51:17.789
What?

51:17.790 --> 51:18.950
Are you sick?

51:19.530 --> 51:20.899
N-No.

51:20.900 --> 51:22.460
Are you dying?

51:22.470 --> 51:24.050
Just tell me that you have...

51:24.890 --> 51:26.350
Oh, I don't give a shit.

51:27.170 --> 51:30.509
Just tell me that's why
you've been acting this way,

51:30.510 --> 51:31.839
so I can just understand.

51:31.840 --> 51:34.240
No, Anna, no. No, I'm not...

51:34.250 --> 51:35.609
I'm-I'm not dying.

51:35.610 --> 51:36.859
I'm not sick.

51:36.860 --> 51:38.860
Then why won't you leave us alone?

51:39.410 --> 51:41.569
After all these years, why now?

51:41.570 --> 51:42.610
Uh...

51:43.320 --> 51:44.740
I'm sorry, I...

51:45.810 --> 51:48.620
I know I made mistakes in the past.

51:49.720 --> 51:51.230
And I'm so sorry.

51:51.690 --> 51:53.330
I-I-I regret...

51:55.480 --> 51:56.840
so much.

51:57.790 --> 52:01.099
And I know I can't just
suddenly fix everything. I'm...

52:01.100 --> 52:02.789
I know that. Anna, please.

52:02.790 --> 52:04.970
Just wait.

52:05.970 --> 52:08.080
For a few minutes, can you...

52:10.000 --> 52:11.740
I don't know, can you just...

52:12.530 --> 52:14.350
pretend you don't know me

52:14.790 --> 52:17.089
and I'm not your negligent father,

52:17.090 --> 52:19.479
not the guy who... left

52:19.480 --> 52:21.769
and-and hurt you

52:21.770 --> 52:23.030
and...

52:23.910 --> 52:25.519
ruined everything.

52:27.650 --> 52:29.340
Can we start over?

52:30.920 --> 52:33.310
Just... tell me

52:33.960 --> 52:36.110
everything about you.

52:37.690 --> 52:39.740
And I'll just listen.
I won't say a word.

52:41.900 --> 52:43.120
Please.

52:45.130 --> 52:46.910
Tell me what I've missed.

52:54.910 --> 53:00.910
