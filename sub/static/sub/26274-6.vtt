WEBVTT

00:08.437 --> 00:10.806
The Toronto Sparrows
in a championship game.

00:10.807 --> 00:12.412
I'm so nervous,
I don't think I can watch.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.581
I'm sure your team
will score the most goals.

00:14.582 --> 00:16.917
Flo, I've dragged you
to every game this season.

00:16.918 --> 00:18.618
How do you not know they score runs?

00:18.619 --> 00:22.088
Four red hot dogs
for two red hot gals.

00:22.089 --> 00:23.890
- Coming up.
- They always taste better

00:23.891 --> 00:24.991
- at the ballpark.
- Yeah,

00:24.992 --> 00:26.760
because they clean the grill
once a month.

00:26.761 --> 00:28.428
It ain't the grill,
sweetheart. It's the game.

00:28.429 --> 00:29.862
The perfect game.

00:30.931 --> 00:33.565
Oh! New edition, barely creased.

00:34.601 --> 00:36.937
- Rainy day fund?
- It's for good luck.

00:36.938 --> 00:38.605
This is baseball.

00:38.606 --> 00:40.640
Everyone's got a superstition.

00:40.641 --> 00:42.708
- Keep the change.
- Play ball!

00:43.610 --> 00:45.544
Flo, Flo, that's her.

00:46.613 --> 00:47.948
- Hey!
- Thank you.

00:47.949 --> 00:49.616
Remember this moment, ladies.

00:49.617 --> 00:51.785
You're in the presence of the greatest

00:51.786 --> 00:54.153
women's player ever. Dorothy Lloyd.

00:56.990 --> 00:58.725
She's going to bruise
the catcher's hand

00:58.726 --> 01:00.860
- with that fastball.
- Hmm-mmm!

01:00.861 --> 01:04.063
1,92 earned run average
and 3,84 at the plate.

01:04.065 --> 01:06.165
She's really something.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.736
I practiced once with the Sparrows.

01:09.737 --> 01:12.371
They do call-ups from my ladies
rec league as injury subs.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.508
But I was so nervous, I barely
spoke with any of the players.

01:17.410 --> 01:20.112
Strike three!

01:21.081 --> 01:22.582
Oh, Viola Kelly.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.584
I didn't know
you were still in the league.

01:24.585 --> 01:25.885
Enough.

01:25.886 --> 01:28.088
Do players always
talk to each other like that?

01:28.089 --> 01:30.257
Oh, catchers always give it
to the batters.

01:30.258 --> 01:32.759
Trying to unerve them.
It's just the game.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.095
Strike!

01:35.096 --> 01:37.097
If you're going to be
a baseball player,

01:37.098 --> 01:40.433
you need to know how to hit. Or catch.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.435
Or throw.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.536
Put a sock in it, Redwood.

01:48.808 --> 01:51.778
Strike two!

01:51.779 --> 01:55.080
Come on, Dorothy! One more strike!

01:57.000 --> 02:03.074

02:04.792 --> 02:06.059
Another inch to the side

02:06.060 --> 02:07.894
and that ball was breaking my elbow

02:07.895 --> 02:09.229
It's not my fault you crowd the plate.

02:09.229 --> 02:10.562
I'll knock one over the fence

02:10.564 --> 02:12.032
and then I'll knock your teeth out.

02:12.033 --> 02:14.767
And I'll knock you both out
if you don't shut up and play!

02:15.735 --> 02:17.904
Dorothy, you're up.

02:17.905 --> 02:21.308
- So that's just the game too?
- Shhh! Dorothy's coming up.

02:21.309 --> 02:23.043
I thought boxing was rough.

02:23.044 --> 02:25.412
- Go, Dorothy!
- Come on, Dorothy.

02:25.413 --> 02:26.678
Do it, Dorothy!

02:33.053 --> 02:34.853
Strike one!

02:37.257 --> 02:39.525
- That's alright.
- Come on, Dorothy. Stay calm.

02:40.493 --> 02:42.395
It's strange, though.
She normally kisses

02:42.396 --> 02:45.098
this lucky ladybug pendant
before every at bat,

02:45.099 --> 02:46.932
but I don't think she has it today.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.947
- Oh!
- Dorothy!

03:00.948 --> 03:04.650
Dorothy! Roll her on her back.
Oh her back. Give her some air.

03:06.553 --> 03:08.555
Are you with us, Dorothy? Dorothy?

03:08.556 --> 03:10.857
- She's not breathing.
- We need a doctor!

03:10.858 --> 03:13.560
We need a doctor!
Anyone here a doctor?

03:13.561 --> 03:15.395
- Out of the way, ladies.
- Anyone?

03:15.396 --> 03:18.565
- Can we get some help?
- Are you a doctor?

03:18.566 --> 03:20.900
- Morgue attendant.
- What the hell?

03:20.901 --> 03:22.435
- Just trust her.
- Just do something!

03:22.436 --> 03:24.036
Trudy, grab her legs.

03:26.406 --> 03:28.674
Is it working? Is she breathing?

03:33.079 --> 03:35.782
Mary! Take a look at this.

03:35.783 --> 03:38.418
Yes, those are the spikes
from a baseball cleat.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.920
Are they always so bent?

03:40.921 --> 03:43.089
You're right!
It looks like it was pried off.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.591
If that's Dorothy's,

03:44.592 --> 03:46.525
I'm not so sure this was an accident.

03:47.761 --> 03:50.095
Are you with us, Dorothy? Dorothy?

03:51.297 --> 03:54.100
Please save her. Please!
Dorothy, can you hear me?

03:54.101 --> 03:56.703
- Dorothy!
- I'm so sorry.

03:56.704 --> 04:00.205
There's nothing I could do.
She's dead.

04:10.893 --> 04:17.067

04:18.892 --> 04:20.726
She's so special, you know?

04:20.728 --> 04:23.229
We checked her shoes.
It looks like her spikes

04:23.230 --> 04:24.898
were pried loose.

04:24.899 --> 04:26.299
But the police said
it was an accident.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.401
Not if her cleats were tampered with.

04:28.402 --> 04:30.403
What I don't understand
is how Dorothy didn't feel

04:30.404 --> 04:32.071
the damaged cleats with every step.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.807
The girls are used to faulty gear.

04:33.808 --> 04:35.742
Ladies baseball...
The damn owners will cut

04:35.743 --> 04:37.509
any corners that they can.

04:39.579 --> 04:41.380
But those were definitely
tampered with.

04:43.416 --> 04:45.418
- You said she's good?
- Frankie?

04:45.419 --> 04:47.052
She is top notch, Coach.

04:48.421 --> 04:50.323
Then consider yourself hired.

04:50.324 --> 04:52.325
So who do you think
might've done this?

04:52.326 --> 04:53.927
The other team would have
the most to gain.

04:53.928 --> 04:55.695
I'd like to start with them.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.831
You ain't been around
many ballplayers, have you?

04:57.832 --> 04:59.232
They're not gonna tell you anything.

04:59.233 --> 05:02.368
- They're like circled wagons.
- Well, maybe there's a witness?

05:02.369 --> 05:03.703
Someone who could'be seen the Comets

05:03.704 --> 05:06.539
- tampering with the gear.
- Equipment manager takes care

05:06.540 --> 05:08.374
- of the gear.
- And where would we find him?

05:08.375 --> 05:11.276
She's about twenty paces that way.

05:12.745 --> 05:15.715
One lady baseball player
kicks off in bizarre fashion

05:15.716 --> 05:18.418
and suddenly I'm working
a Saturday rush autopsy.

05:18.419 --> 05:20.720
It's not like this broad
was Babe Ruth.

05:20.721 --> 05:23.389
Well, a coroner's never short
of customers, Dr. Thomson,

05:23.390 --> 05:27.727
- I suppose. Cause of death?
- Cardiac arrest due to trauma.

05:27.728 --> 05:30.263
Broke a rib when she fell,
which stabbed her in the heart.

05:30.264 --> 05:32.232
- She died instantly.
- Accidental death.

05:32.233 --> 05:34.200
I'll take care of it from here.

05:34.201 --> 05:35.735
Good.

05:35.736 --> 05:36.736
I got a tip on a pony

05:36.737 --> 05:38.837
in the third race at Dufferin.

05:39.739 --> 05:41.159
Mop and bucket are in the closet.

05:42.575 --> 05:44.878
So, what did Dr Charming
have to say about Dorothy?

05:44.879 --> 05:47.080
Broken rib to the heart.

05:47.081 --> 05:49.249
You know, it's strange
that an elite athlete

05:49.250 --> 05:50.950
would break a rib
from a simple tumble.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.886
So Frankie and Mary are investigating?

05:52.887 --> 05:55.555
Yeah. This whole thing
seems suspicious.

05:55.556 --> 05:56.989
Let's get a closer look.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.860
Be a lot easier if you had a catcher.

06:00.861 --> 06:03.029
Redwood is on her fourth gin
at the Clover Club by now.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.531
- Who're you?
- Frankie Drake.

06:04.532 --> 06:06.366
I'm a private detective.
I'm looking into

06:06.367 --> 06:08.034
- what happened to Dorothy.
- I thought the cops said

06:08.035 --> 06:10.069
- it was just a freak accident.
- Well, that may be so,

06:10.070 --> 06:11.538
but Coach thought it was worth

06:11.539 --> 06:13.373
Frankie taking another look.

06:13.374 --> 06:15.441
Long as I can keep throwing.
I'm starting tomorrow.

06:15.442 --> 06:17.544
So they rescheduled the championship?

06:17.545 --> 06:19.279
Yeah. And I've only got
a couple hours to practice

06:19.280 --> 06:20.646
before my shift at the mill.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.051
A lot of the girls have two jobs.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.653
- Some even have three.
- That sounds exhausting.

06:28.555 --> 06:30.390
But it's worth it, right?

06:30.391 --> 06:33.726
Being on this field...
Smelling the grass...

06:33.727 --> 06:36.663
- The feel of a leather glove.
- Yeah, you bet. You play too?

06:36.664 --> 06:38.431
Starting pitcher for the Foxes.

06:38.432 --> 06:41.568
I led the ladies rec league
in wins two straight seasons.

06:41.569 --> 06:43.201
Hey, I can catch if it'll help.

06:45.171 --> 06:46.406
Um...

06:46.407 --> 06:48.741
Before the game, did you see anyone

06:48.742 --> 06:50.410
going through the equipment bags?

06:50.411 --> 06:52.078
No, but once I drop off the bags,

06:52.079 --> 06:54.080
- I don't keep watch.
- Where did you leave them?

06:54.081 --> 06:56.181
Same place as always.

06:59.519 --> 07:02.454
Come on, Mary.
We might just have a witness.

07:08.861 --> 07:11.197
I usually open up... about 90 minutes

07:11.198 --> 07:13.199
before the first pitch.
People like to grab a dog

07:13.200 --> 07:15.702
- and find a seat.
- You have a terrific view

07:15.703 --> 07:17.537
- of the field.
- Best seat in the house!

07:17.538 --> 07:19.038
It's the main reason I do this job.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.207
Before the game,
did you see any of the Comets

07:21.208 --> 07:23.308
going through
the Sparrows' equipment bags?

07:24.711 --> 07:26.379
I'm pretty sure I saw Viola Kelly

07:26.380 --> 07:28.548
- digging through the gear.
- The first baseman!

07:28.549 --> 07:30.383
She's the one who went
head to head with Dorothy.

07:30.384 --> 07:32.885
- They have a complicated past.
- What do you mean?

07:32.886 --> 07:35.054
Well, last year,
she played for the Sparrows.

07:35.055 --> 07:37.390
- Did she leave?
- No. They traded her

07:37.391 --> 07:38.391
for an outfielder.

07:38.392 --> 07:40.560
That's what they said, but word is,

07:40.561 --> 07:42.562
the team wasn't big enough
for the two of them.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.731
Nothing kills a locker
room like jealousy.

07:44.732 --> 07:46.032
Thanks for your time.

07:46.033 --> 07:48.467
I'll... see you at the game tomorrow.

07:50.903 --> 07:52.238
If Viola did this,

07:52.239 --> 07:54.574
her lack of sportsmanship
is appalling.

07:54.575 --> 07:55.675
So we have a suspect.

07:55.676 --> 07:58.110
Hey! There's something you gotta see.

08:00.079 --> 08:02.348
They say one should never
meet their idols

08:02.349 --> 08:04.350
and I'm pretty sure this is worse.

08:04.351 --> 08:06.185
That's some nasty bruising.

08:06.186 --> 08:07.820
Dr. Thomson chalked it up to lividity.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.188
Blood pooling after death.

08:09.189 --> 08:11.524
But didn't you roll her over
onto her back when you tried

08:11.525 --> 08:12.859
- to resuscitate her?
- We did.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.527
So the blood should have
pooled elsewhere.

08:14.528 --> 08:16.195
And bruises don't develop after death,

08:16.196 --> 08:18.031
so there's no way this came
from when she fell.

08:18.032 --> 08:19.198
She was injured before the game.

08:19.199 --> 08:20.400
The night before.

08:20.401 --> 08:22.035
And I've seen a lot of bruises.

08:22.036 --> 08:24.671
It looks like she was hit with
something heavy and rectangular.

08:24.672 --> 08:26.205
An attack or a fight.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.874
Which resulted in a broken rib.

08:27.875 --> 08:30.209
So the tempered cleats
is what caused her to fall,

08:30.210 --> 08:31.878
but the broken rib caused her death.

08:31.879 --> 08:33.712
Viola should be ashamed of herself.

08:33.714 --> 08:36.049
Grudge or no grudge,
that's no way to win a game.

08:36.049 --> 08:37.230
We need to talk to Viola.

08:53.733 --> 08:56.002
It's a bit lonely drinking
by yourself, isn't it, Viola?

08:56.003 --> 08:58.004
I like the quiet.
Though it doesn't seem

08:58.005 --> 08:59.906
like I'm going to get any. Who're you?

08:59.907 --> 09:02.341
Frankie Drake.
I'm a private investigator.

09:02.342 --> 09:03.843
This is my associate Mary Shaw.

09:03.844 --> 09:05.678
I'm a big fan, Miss Kelly.

09:05.679 --> 09:07.513
And I am sorry that we're interrupting

09:07.514 --> 09:09.682
your quiet time,
but your teammates told us

09:09.683 --> 09:11.851
- that we could find you here.
- We'd like to ask you

09:11.852 --> 09:13.618
a few questions about Dorothy.

09:14.520 --> 09:15.620
Shoot.

09:16.522 --> 09:19.025
Well, it appears that Dorothy
was attacked last night.

09:19.026 --> 09:20.393
You know anything about that?

09:20.394 --> 09:22.561
Attack Dorothy? Are you nuts?

09:23.863 --> 09:26.532
Well, someone beat her up
and she died because of it.

09:26.533 --> 09:29.035
She'd eat me alive in a fight.

09:29.036 --> 09:30.335
Not if you had a weapon.

09:31.370 --> 09:33.206
Want to search me
for a sock full of pennies?

09:33.207 --> 09:34.373
We know you had a grudge against her

09:34.374 --> 09:35.875
from your days as a Sparrow.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.877
She walked around
like she owned the team,

09:37.878 --> 09:40.046
with the coach tied around
her little finger.

09:40.047 --> 09:41.967
So maybe you wanted
to knock her down a few pegs.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.384
I'm not going to kill a person
to win a ball game.

09:45.385 --> 09:46.719
That's plain crazy.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.222
Well, maybe you wanted
to knock her out of the lineup.

09:49.223 --> 09:51.891
You had a few drinks,
got a few bad ideas,

09:51.892 --> 09:53.726
then you ran into her last night.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.394
Hold on.

09:55.395 --> 09:56.863
Last night, I was in Windsor.

09:56.864 --> 09:58.597
You didn't travel here with your team?

09:59.565 --> 10:01.267
This is ladies baseball.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.935
You think the owners
are going to pony up

10:02.936 --> 10:03.903
for us to stay in a hotel?

10:03.904 --> 10:05.104
Where are you staying tonight?

10:05.105 --> 10:07.406
They didn't have a choice
with the game postponed.

10:07.407 --> 10:09.842
But they've got us four to a room.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.209
Your coach will back this up?

10:12.411 --> 10:15.414
Our train pulled into Toronto
an hour before game time.

10:15.415 --> 10:17.682
Now, if you'll quit wasting my time...

10:21.420 --> 10:23.256
She was your teammate once.

10:23.257 --> 10:25.091
You could at least pretend
that you're sad.

10:25.092 --> 10:26.425
Don't worry, Mary.

10:26.426 --> 10:27.760
This game is far from over.

10:34.892 --> 10:37.261
So someone beat up Dorothy
bad enough to break her rib.

10:37.262 --> 10:39.129
But she was so tough,
she still suited up

10:39.130 --> 10:41.131
- for the game today.
- And then that same person

10:41.132 --> 10:42.633
tampered with her cleats.

10:42.634 --> 10:44.301
Desperate move by a no-good cheater.

10:44.302 --> 10:46.103
The other team wasn't even in town.

10:46.104 --> 10:48.485
So who benefits from
the best player in the league

10:48.486 --> 10:49.819
missing the championship game?

10:49.820 --> 10:51.254
Mary, you're in the
bleachers every game.

10:51.255 --> 10:52.937
Do you see a lot of gambling going on?

10:52.938 --> 10:54.591
If I was on duty,
I'd have my hands full,

10:54.592 --> 10:55.759
- that's for sure.
- The Sparrows

10:55.760 --> 10:57.260
are the heavy favourites.

10:57.261 --> 10:59.262
So if some high roller
bet on the Comets,

10:59.263 --> 11:01.798
- then took Dorothy out...
- He could win a fortune.

11:01.799 --> 11:03.934
We need to retrace Dorothy's
steps from last night.

11:03.935 --> 11:04.968
I'm on it.

11:04.969 --> 11:06.169
I'm going to track down Redwood.

11:06.170 --> 11:08.104
Catchers know their pitchers
better than anyone.

11:08.105 --> 11:09.572
Maybe she heard something.

11:09.573 --> 11:10.941
And I assume you'll be
knocking down the doors

11:10.942 --> 11:12.142
of Toronto's finest bookmakers?

11:12.143 --> 11:13.777
There's only one bookmaker in town

11:13.778 --> 11:15.612
who deals with that kind of action.

11:15.613 --> 11:16.880
Frankie, be careful.

11:16.881 --> 11:18.815
The gambling world is a
dark place to dive into.

11:32.330 --> 11:34.597
Bouquet or wreath?

11:34.598 --> 11:36.967
I was told this is where I should go

11:36.968 --> 11:38.567
if I want to get in on some action.

11:41.137 --> 11:42.806
No business without a referral.

11:42.807 --> 11:44.240
I'm just looking to
make the Sparrows game

11:44.241 --> 11:45.809
a little more interesting tomorrow.

11:45.810 --> 11:47.510
Yeah, I don't know
what you're talking about.

11:47.511 --> 11:49.612
It's just a flower shop. Hit the road.

11:49.613 --> 11:51.915
My money's just as good
as anyone else's.

11:51.916 --> 11:53.736
You need to leave
before I make you leave.

11:54.584 --> 11:55.852
Who's in charge around here?

11:55.853 --> 11:57.587
It's just a flower shop.

11:57.588 --> 12:00.289
It's alright, Dario. I'll handle this.

12:04.461 --> 12:05.929
Twenty dollar minimum.

12:05.930 --> 12:07.497
This ain't a nickel and dime shop.

12:07.498 --> 12:09.265
I assume you accept cash?

12:09.266 --> 12:11.534
Gonna need a name for the ledger.

12:11.535 --> 12:13.235
Frankie.

12:14.304 --> 12:17.273
And you chose today
to suddenly start gambling.

12:17.274 --> 12:20.042
Women's league suddenly got
a bit more interesting.

12:21.111 --> 12:24.447
- And you are?
- Bessie Starkman.

12:24.448 --> 12:27.283
Take the cash out slowly or...

12:27.284 --> 12:29.853
Dario here will get itchy.

12:29.854 --> 12:31.987
What are the odds
on the Sparrows tomorrow?

12:33.624 --> 12:35.390
Pays three-to-two.

12:36.459 --> 12:38.060
Won't get rich on that.

12:39.629 --> 12:41.965
Comets were fourteen-to-one longshot

12:41.966 --> 12:44.300
until that player dropped dead
and made a mess of my odds.

12:44.301 --> 12:47.069
Still. Got to support the home team.

12:48.304 --> 12:49.505
Let's see the money.

12:56.579 --> 12:59.348
You're not the usual type
we get in here.

13:01.418 --> 13:03.420
Guys with too much money

13:03.421 --> 13:04.988
who can't help themselves.

13:04.989 --> 13:07.356
Well, we all have our layers.

13:08.425 --> 13:10.692
Books judged by cover and all that.

13:12.262 --> 13:14.530
Right. All that.

13:21.104 --> 13:22.939
Point is, you win?

13:22.940 --> 13:24.373
Come collect.

13:25.942 --> 13:27.944
You lose? Don't come crying.

13:27.945 --> 13:30.045
I know what I'm getting into.

13:31.281 --> 13:33.048
I'm not so sure you do.

13:47.130 --> 13:48.465
What can I get you?

13:48.466 --> 13:49.966
Uh... Nothing.

13:49.967 --> 13:52.635
I don't drink alcohol,
seeing as it is against the law.

13:52.636 --> 13:53.969
Oh, is it?

13:54.938 --> 13:56.439
I'm looking for Redwood Richardson

13:56.440 --> 13:58.241
and I understand she's a regular here.

13:58.242 --> 13:59.909
I can't get you an autograph.

13:59.910 --> 14:01.911
Have you seen her today?

14:01.912 --> 14:03.413
You think I'll answer that
just 'cause you asked?

14:03.414 --> 14:05.748
Alright. Alright.

14:05.749 --> 14:08.751
I'll ask again when I'm in
my Morality Officer uniform

14:08.752 --> 14:10.852
and I've come to shut down
this establishment.

14:11.754 --> 14:13.522
- Alright. Look...
- Stop.

14:14.891 --> 14:16.391
Just hold that thought.

14:18.294 --> 14:19.963
Alright, alright, go.

14:19.964 --> 14:21.931
Redwood was seeing triple
about an hour ago.

14:21.932 --> 14:23.433
I asked her to leave.

14:23.434 --> 14:25.268
She kicked me. It hurt.
And then she left.

14:25.269 --> 14:26.769
Well, did she say where she was going?

14:26.770 --> 14:28.203
She was too busy kicking me.

14:29.606 --> 14:31.107
What about while she was imbibing?

14:31.108 --> 14:33.276
Did she say anything then?
Maybe about her team.

14:33.277 --> 14:35.278
She wouldn't shut up about Dorothy.

14:35.279 --> 14:37.280
Well, her teammate did just pass away.

14:37.281 --> 14:39.282
Yeah, sure, she was sad, but...

14:39.283 --> 14:40.617
It was different.

14:40.618 --> 14:41.618
Like she was hurt.

14:41.619 --> 14:44.052
I didn't think Redwood
even had feelings.

14:47.457 --> 14:48.791
If you see her again,

14:48.792 --> 14:50.527
could you ask her to
call the police station

14:50.528 --> 14:52.228
and ask for Mary Shaw?

14:52.229 --> 14:54.249
As long as you don't bring
the squad down here.

14:56.399 --> 14:57.499
Sure.

14:58.468 --> 14:59.736
I'll kill them.

14:59.737 --> 15:01.171
I'll kill them.

15:01.172 --> 15:03.406
Whoever laid a hand on Dorothy
better stay out of my sight.

15:03.407 --> 15:04.607
Who would hurt her?

15:04.608 --> 15:06.409
Practice ended at 5pm.

15:06.410 --> 15:07.410
Then what?

15:07.411 --> 15:08.878
We had a team dinner.

15:08.879 --> 15:11.314
Dorothy seemed fine.
A bit preoccupied,

15:11.315 --> 15:12.749
but that's normal before any big game.

15:12.750 --> 15:14.217
After dinner, did you go out?

15:14.218 --> 15:15.852
Yeah. We went out to the Clover Club.

15:15.853 --> 15:17.720
I didn't last too long.

15:17.721 --> 15:19.981
But you were sitting with her
for a while, weren't you?

15:20.323 --> 15:21.357
Yeah, she was laughing.

15:21.358 --> 15:23.092
Excited. But then...

15:23.093 --> 15:24.227
Something happened.

15:24.228 --> 15:25.662
It's team business.

15:25.663 --> 15:28.031
Getting to the bottom of this
is what matters to the team. So?

15:28.032 --> 15:30.266
Redwood just tore a strip off her.

15:30.267 --> 15:32.635
- About what?
- I don't know.

15:32.636 --> 15:33.937
Teammates fight.

15:33.938 --> 15:35.338
They went to a private corner, argued.

15:35.339 --> 15:36.773
Then Dorothy left out the back door.

15:36.774 --> 15:38.308
Listen, are we done?
I gotta get to work.

15:38.309 --> 15:39.776
Did Redwood follow her out back?

15:39.777 --> 15:41.778
It's not my job to
babysit the starters.

15:41.779 --> 15:43.519
Alright? You're gonna have
to ask Redwood.

15:57.894 --> 15:59.494
Redwood Richardson!

16:04.067 --> 16:05.175
Uh... Detective Greyson,

16:05.176 --> 16:07.036
- might I have a moment?
- No time, Shaw.

16:07.037 --> 16:09.405
Staff Sergeant dumped
Ty Cobb over there on me

16:09.406 --> 16:11.241
right at quitting time. The nerve!

16:11.242 --> 16:13.409
- What's she in for?
- Public nuisance.

16:13.410 --> 16:14.840
And you know I just
don't have the time

16:14.841 --> 16:16.246
for this. I've got
better things to do.

16:16.247 --> 16:18.081
Why don't you release her
into my custody?

16:18.082 --> 16:20.750
I was actually looking for her.

16:20.751 --> 16:23.419
She's got a game tomorrow
and I was thinking...

16:23.420 --> 16:25.121
I'll release her to you.

16:25.122 --> 16:27.757
Right after she sleeps it
off in the drunk tank.

16:27.758 --> 16:29.759
Detective, do you like baseball?

16:29.760 --> 16:30.860
Officer Shaw...

16:33.096 --> 16:35.932
- Yes! I love baseball.
- Oh!

16:35.933 --> 16:37.233
Ever since my father

16:37.234 --> 16:38.735
put a glove in my hand
when I was three years old.

16:38.736 --> 16:40.570
- You too!
- Hmm-mm.

16:40.571 --> 16:43.773
Wow! So since we both share this deep

16:43.774 --> 16:45.441
and abiding passion for the game,

16:45.442 --> 16:48.278
perhaps in this instance

16:48.279 --> 16:50.546
- you could make an exception...
- Nice try, Shaw.

16:50.547 --> 16:52.314
You'll get her tomorrow.

17:16.571 --> 17:17.839
That's our cue.

17:27.916 --> 17:29.252
That was easy.

17:29.253 --> 17:30.420
How are you going
to break into the safe?

17:30.421 --> 17:32.755
- I have my ways.
- Spy training?

17:32.756 --> 17:34.689
- Spy training.
- I'll keep watch.

18:37.253 --> 18:39.922
You crooks took my man
for everything he got!

18:39.923 --> 18:41.758
He even bet my wedding ring!

18:41.759 --> 18:43.126
It's despicable!

18:43.127 --> 18:45.595
Why would anyone let a man
bet something like that, uh?

18:45.596 --> 18:46.829
That's between you and him.

18:46.830 --> 18:48.431
- Listen here!
- OK. Woah!

18:48.432 --> 18:50.867
I want my damn money back.
And I want my ring!

18:50.868 --> 18:53.536
And I want taxi money. It's dark out!

18:53.537 --> 18:56.072
I'm not in charge, sweetheart.
I don't own the joint.

18:56.073 --> 18:57.173
- Fine! Fine. Look.
- Hey!

18:57.174 --> 18:59.208
You know what?
If you won't give my money back,

18:59.209 --> 19:01.210
then you ought to come with
me to give him a whooping.

19:01.211 --> 19:02.612
I... That's not what I do.

19:02.613 --> 19:04.213
Teach that damn fool a lesson.

19:04.214 --> 19:06.448
Maybe I can even
get a shot at him myself.

19:08.384 --> 19:09.552
Are you mad?

19:09.553 --> 19:10.720
What is wrong with you?

19:10.721 --> 19:13.222
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

19:13.223 --> 19:16.392
Let go of me, you brute
or I'm screaming for the police.

19:16.393 --> 19:17.659
Uh!

19:19.562 --> 19:21.863
Sorry! I don't...

19:24.867 --> 19:27.236
$500 on the Sparrows.

19:27.237 --> 19:28.905
A thousand on the Sparrows.

19:28.906 --> 19:30.706
People have way too much money!

19:30.707 --> 19:32.241
Soon parted.

19:32.242 --> 19:34.410
Look at that.
There's $200 on the Comets.

19:34.411 --> 19:35.411
No, not enough.

19:35.412 --> 19:37.178
It had to be worth their while.

19:38.581 --> 19:39.882
Well, look at this.

19:39.883 --> 19:43.753
$2,000 on the Comets
just two days before the game

19:43.754 --> 19:45.388
and when the odds
were still fourteen to one.

19:45.389 --> 19:48.424
- So they stood to win $28,000.
- Oh!

19:48.425 --> 19:49.724
That is motive.

19:50.760 --> 19:53.262
Looks like the name is George Windsor.

19:53.263 --> 19:55.431
I'm willing to guess
the King of England

19:55.432 --> 19:57.433
isn't gambling on women's baseball

19:57.434 --> 19:59.534
in Toronto. That's our the guy.

20:01.103 --> 20:03.538
- We expecting anyone?
- No.

20:05.975 --> 20:07.610
I brought her
straight from the station.

20:07.611 --> 20:09.946
She vomited twice
on the way over here.

20:09.947 --> 20:11.546
OK...

20:15.618 --> 20:17.286
I'm not in the mood to talk.

20:17.287 --> 20:19.554
How about a little hair of the dog?

20:20.456 --> 20:21.556
That'll work.

20:22.458 --> 20:24.460
Championship at stake.

20:24.461 --> 20:26.929
Everything else going on...
You must be tense.

20:26.930 --> 20:29.131
Rookies get tense.

20:29.132 --> 20:31.300
I'm delightful.

20:31.301 --> 20:32.969
We know you and Dorothy
got into a fight

20:32.970 --> 20:34.170
the night before she died.

20:34.171 --> 20:35.570
The thing at the Clover?

20:36.472 --> 20:37.807
It's team business.

20:37.808 --> 20:39.976
That team business turned physical?

20:39.977 --> 20:41.511
If I had hit Dorothy,

20:41.512 --> 20:42.812
she wouldn't have gotten back up.

20:42.813 --> 20:44.714
Well, that's not an alibi.

20:44.715 --> 20:47.450
You just admitted you got
into a fight with her.

20:47.451 --> 20:48.651
Argument.

20:48.652 --> 20:50.586
I... I never said fight.

20:50.587 --> 20:52.588
So you followed her out back
and knocked her up a little

20:52.589 --> 20:53.723
so she missed the game?

20:53.724 --> 20:55.925
Why would I want
to bench our best player?

20:55.926 --> 20:58.127
I can think of about
28,000 reasons why.

20:58.128 --> 20:59.595
What's with you broads?

20:59.596 --> 21:01.931
First you say I want to
beat up my teammate,

21:01.932 --> 21:03.766
now you're talking gibberish.

21:03.767 --> 21:05.768
We know a high roller bet big money

21:05.769 --> 21:07.403
- against the Sparrows.
- And we know

21:07.404 --> 21:09.344
Dorothy was attacked
the night before the game.

21:10.106 --> 21:11.607
- You a gambler?
- Uh...

21:11.608 --> 21:12.808
You think...

21:12.809 --> 21:16.111
You think I beat up Dorothy
so she'd miss the game?

21:17.013 --> 21:18.014
It's a theory.

21:22.451 --> 21:23.786
You got this all wrong.

21:23.787 --> 21:25.220
What do you mean?

21:26.455 --> 21:27.589
Enlighten us.

21:29.625 --> 21:32.595
The day before the game, at practice,

21:32.596 --> 21:35.731
Dorothy's pitches were... strange.

21:35.732 --> 21:36.966
Strange how?

21:36.967 --> 21:39.268
The spots she kept hitting
in the strike zone

21:39.269 --> 21:40.970
would have gotten cranked for sure.

21:40.971 --> 21:43.306
I knew exactly what she was doing.

21:43.307 --> 21:45.274
Catcher always knows.

21:45.275 --> 21:46.642
No way.

21:46.643 --> 21:47.944
Not Dorothy.

21:47.945 --> 21:50.913
So that's why I got up
in her face at the Clover.

21:50.914 --> 21:53.348
I told her I knew what she was up to.

21:54.250 --> 21:56.351
I asked how she could
live with herself.

21:57.420 --> 21:58.921
You're saying...

21:58.922 --> 22:02.258
That the greatest female
baseball player of all time

22:02.259 --> 22:03.559
was dirty? Yeah.

22:03.560 --> 22:06.228
That's exactly what I'm saying.

22:06.229 --> 22:09.031
Dorothy Lloyd was going to
throw the championship game.

22:18.940 --> 22:21.276
Why would Dorothy Lloyd,
the best player in the league,

22:21.277 --> 22:22.777
throw a championship game?

22:22.778 --> 22:24.779
These women barely get paid
enough to get by.

22:24.780 --> 22:26.281
Another payday would be tempting.

22:26.282 --> 22:29.583
But where did Dorothy
get $2,000 to bet on the Comets?

22:30.619 --> 22:33.121
Clearly it's the Black Sox
all over again!

22:33.122 --> 22:34.789
Shoeless Joe and the rest of them,

22:34.790 --> 22:36.291
they didn't bet their own money.

22:36.292 --> 22:39.294
A bunch of high rollers
paid off the players

22:39.295 --> 22:41.296
to throw the 1919 World Series.

22:41.297 --> 22:43.465
And then the gamblers,
they made off like bandits!

22:43.466 --> 22:45.600
So we think a smaller version
is playing out here?

22:45.601 --> 22:47.035
Yeah!

22:47.036 --> 22:49.237
But if this 'George Windsor'
paid her to throw the game,

22:49.238 --> 22:50.572
he wouldn't have attacked her.

22:50.573 --> 22:51.740
Then who?

22:51.741 --> 22:53.742
Maybe another teammate caught wind.

22:53.743 --> 22:54.910
I would be upset too.

22:54.911 --> 22:56.111
Could be.

22:56.112 --> 22:57.746
Take her out of the game
before she loses on purpose.

22:57.747 --> 22:59.614
Right. But she still
made it to the game,

22:59.615 --> 23:01.082
so they tampered with her cleats.

23:01.083 --> 23:03.418
The whole team was
at the Clover Club that night.

23:03.419 --> 23:04.586
It could be any one of them.

23:04.587 --> 23:06.588
That is a lot of players to question.

23:06.589 --> 23:09.257
What we really need
is someone on the inside.

23:09.258 --> 23:10.592
Right.

23:10.593 --> 23:12.761
Someone who can sniff out
the players who knew

23:12.762 --> 23:13.862
that Dorothy was throwing the game.

23:13.863 --> 23:15.629
Who do you think?

23:16.598 --> 23:18.232
Good thing we've have a ringer.

23:19.768 --> 23:21.035
Oh!

23:21.937 --> 23:23.370
Yes!

23:27.609 --> 23:29.777
Alright, ladies, bring it in!

23:30.946 --> 23:32.847
Alright.

23:32.848 --> 23:35.817
What happened yesterday
was real a punch in the gut.

23:35.818 --> 23:38.853
We're all gonna grieve for her
in our own way tomorrow.

23:38.854 --> 23:40.522
But today...

23:40.523 --> 23:42.624
Today, Dorothy would want us to play

23:42.625 --> 23:44.726
like it was last time
playing on a ball diamond.

23:44.727 --> 23:48.296
Because you never know when
that last time is going to be.

23:48.297 --> 23:50.232
So let's make this one count.

23:50.233 --> 23:52.234
Let's win this for Dorothy!

23:52.235 --> 23:53.335
- Yeah!
- Alright?

23:54.236 --> 23:56.738
One other thing. Mary Shaw here
is our emergency call-up

23:56.739 --> 23:58.573
for the open roster spot, so...

23:58.574 --> 24:00.075
Make her feel welcome.

24:00.076 --> 24:01.675
Thanks, Coach.

24:02.577 --> 24:04.412
It's such an honour to be here.

24:04.413 --> 24:08.315
I know that Dorothy
meant a lot to all of us.

24:10.252 --> 24:11.586
So what do we do first?

24:11.587 --> 24:12.986
Ground balls, batting practice?

24:15.757 --> 24:17.759
They... just miss Dorothy

24:17.760 --> 24:19.094
and they're taking it out on you.

24:19.095 --> 24:21.263
Right. I'll try not to
take it too personally.

24:21.264 --> 24:23.598
I figured Dorothy's
cleats still held a clue.

24:23.599 --> 24:25.934
Well, whoever attacked Dorothy
tempered with those cleats.

24:25.935 --> 24:27.235
They wanted her out of that game.

24:27.236 --> 24:29.537
You see how there's
a scuff marks on the sole

24:29.538 --> 24:31.273
of the shoe where the spikes
have been pried loose?

24:31.274 --> 24:33.108
It looks like someone
was trying to jam something

24:33.109 --> 24:34.609
under the left side of the spikes.

24:34.610 --> 24:36.811
Exactly. If you turn it like this...

24:36.812 --> 24:38.712
There's a little blue smudge.

24:39.614 --> 24:40.949
Yeah. Looks like there's some paint

24:40.950 --> 24:42.450
that rubbed off from the leather.

24:42.451 --> 24:43.984
Look at this.

24:45.120 --> 24:47.222
See how the wooden handle
is rubbing the shoe?

24:47.223 --> 24:49.057
It's in the same spot
as the blue smudge.

24:49.058 --> 24:50.725
Which means someone used a tool

24:50.726 --> 24:53.561
with a painted blue handle
to pry the spikes loose.

24:53.562 --> 24:55.764
Find that blue tool, find the guy.

24:55.765 --> 24:57.398
Great work, Flo!

24:58.566 --> 24:59.901
The whole team was here that night.

24:59.902 --> 25:02.336
Those girls... They drank more
than the fellows.

25:03.238 --> 25:04.406
To the Sparrows!

25:04.407 --> 25:07.242
Tomorrow, we show everyone
what we can really do!

25:07.243 --> 25:10.010
- Here, here!
- Cheers! Woo!

25:12.714 --> 25:14.749
And did you see Dorothy
go out the back door?

25:14.750 --> 25:17.319
I'd done the same thing too
if Redwood was yelling at me.

25:17.320 --> 25:19.954
- I saw with my own two eyes!
- No, I didn't. Take it back!

25:19.955 --> 25:21.256
I know what you did!

25:21.257 --> 25:23.291
- I would never!
- You did and I saw!

25:23.292 --> 25:25.093
- You saw?
- Tell me right now!

25:25.094 --> 25:26.127
I might actually get to play tomorrow.

25:26.128 --> 25:27.262
What about anyone else?

25:27.263 --> 25:28.330
Maybe one of the players?

25:28.331 --> 25:30.364
Nope. Just the coach.

25:31.933 --> 25:32.934
Excuse-me.

25:32.935 --> 25:34.368
Evelyn, did you see Dorothy?

25:38.573 --> 25:40.508
Dutch said that he left early.

25:40.509 --> 25:41.743
He did.

25:41.744 --> 25:43.712
Then he came back,
spoke to some of the players

25:43.713 --> 25:45.246
and then left out the back door.

25:45.247 --> 25:47.082
Same time as Dorothy?

25:47.083 --> 25:48.950
Maybe 10 minutes later?

25:48.951 --> 25:50.083
Just out there?

25:53.722 --> 25:54.723
I must admit...

25:54.724 --> 25:56.257
I am a bit nervous.

25:56.258 --> 25:57.559
It's a big game.

25:57.560 --> 25:59.928
How about you?
Big game, lots of pressure.

25:59.929 --> 26:02.230
Fans, reporters out there...

26:02.231 --> 26:03.231
Gamblers...

26:03.232 --> 26:05.499
Hey, how about those Black Sox?

26:06.501 --> 26:07.835
How about that, right?

26:13.375 --> 26:14.976
Shaw!

26:14.977 --> 26:16.244
You're up to bat!

26:16.245 --> 26:17.345
Yeah!

26:20.949 --> 26:22.617
How about those Black Sox?

26:22.618 --> 26:23.918
They're in for life!

26:23.919 --> 26:25.220
It's not the kinf of thing
you want to talk about

26:25.221 --> 26:26.454
- on the field.
- Yeah,

26:26.455 --> 26:27.589
but it serves them right,
though, don't you think?

26:27.590 --> 26:29.389
You talk too much, rookie.

26:31.426 --> 26:33.261
Don't worry, I'm still on my mission.

26:33.262 --> 26:34.929
I'm just having
a little bit of trouble

26:34.930 --> 26:37.599
- breaking through.
- Shut up and don't talk to me.

26:37.600 --> 26:38.700
OK.

26:46.541 --> 26:47.876
So, just in theory...

26:47.877 --> 26:50.345
What would it take
to throw a game like this?

26:50.346 --> 26:51.713
Just... just in theory.

26:51.714 --> 26:52.714
Shaw!

26:52.715 --> 26:53.815
Come here.

26:55.049 --> 26:57.051
Hey, Coach, did you see my land drive?

26:57.052 --> 26:58.219
Just a second ago?

26:58.220 --> 26:59.220
When I agreed to add you to the team,

26:59.221 --> 27:01.222
Frankie didn't say
anything about a fix.

27:01.223 --> 27:02.557
So why are you riling all my players?

27:02.558 --> 27:04.726
Coach, Frankie has reason
to believe that Dorothy

27:04.727 --> 27:06.561
was paid to lose the game on purpose.

27:06.562 --> 27:08.229
You be careful what you say about her!

27:08.230 --> 27:09.864
Believe me, it breaks my heart
just as much as the next...

27:09.865 --> 27:11.733
You do not get to accuse her. Alright?

27:11.734 --> 27:13.101
No, Coach, I'm just
telling you the evidence.

27:13.102 --> 27:14.334
The evidence?

27:15.403 --> 27:16.905
- Where's Frankie now?
- She's...

27:16.906 --> 27:18.205
She's at the Clover Club.

27:20.241 --> 27:21.242
Redwood!

27:21.243 --> 27:22.676
You're in charge!

27:24.579 --> 27:25.680
Shaw!

27:25.681 --> 27:27.214
Ten lapses!

27:55.877 --> 27:57.711
That's Dorothy's
lucky ladybug pendant.

27:58.713 --> 28:00.548
And you're smearing
the name of a great woman,

28:00.549 --> 28:01.616
- you know that?
- You said

28:01.617 --> 28:02.717
that you left early that night,

28:02.718 --> 28:03.952
but you came back.

28:03.953 --> 28:05.720
I'll be damned if I let you
destroy her reputation.

28:05.721 --> 28:07.755
The bartender saw you
follow Dorothy out here.

28:07.756 --> 28:09.023
I was worried about her, that's why.

28:09.024 --> 28:10.358
You knew that she was going
to throw the game.

28:10.359 --> 28:12.227
- She was never gonna do that!
- So you attacked her.

28:12.228 --> 28:14.494
No. I loved Dorothy.

28:15.897 --> 28:17.564
You two were having an affair?

28:18.900 --> 28:20.500
I wanted to marry her.

28:21.436 --> 28:23.071
But she didn't want
anybody to know about us.

28:23.072 --> 28:25.672
What would the girls on the team say?

28:27.242 --> 28:28.576
So we had to play these...

28:29.945 --> 28:31.345
...little games.

28:32.247 --> 28:34.014
I'd leave the club
20 minutes before her.

28:35.083 --> 28:37.017
If word got out she'd...

28:38.086 --> 28:39.953
But she didn't meet you as planned.

28:41.656 --> 28:43.190
She came out the back way.

28:44.259 --> 28:46.126
So I came out here, but...

28:48.530 --> 28:49.697
She wasn't here.

28:49.698 --> 28:50.798
She was gone.

28:51.866 --> 28:54.267
I asked what happened the
next morning at the game.

28:55.537 --> 28:57.638
She didn't tell me
how much pain she was in.

28:59.040 --> 29:00.807
This wasn't your fault.

29:01.876 --> 29:03.310
She's still gone.

29:18.893 --> 29:21.662
Did you pick the lock or will
I need a new bathroom window?

29:22.730 --> 29:24.566
Your bet has been disqualified.

29:24.567 --> 29:26.233
So you're here to give me a refund?

29:27.902 --> 29:30.738
Every evening, I glue one single hair

29:30.739 --> 29:32.407
across the door of my safe.

29:32.408 --> 29:34.342
Well, that can't be good
for your scalp.

29:34.343 --> 29:35.410
You think I wasn't onto you

29:35.411 --> 29:36.911
the moment you walked in to my shop?

29:36.912 --> 29:39.314
Toronto's only female PI.

29:39.315 --> 29:41.049
Maybe you need better security.

29:41.050 --> 29:43.251
You're gonna tell me
what you were fishing for

29:43.252 --> 29:45.587
or I'll have Dario start
breaking your toes

29:45.588 --> 29:46.654
and work his way up from there.

29:46.655 --> 29:48.188
You should be thanking me.

29:49.090 --> 29:50.592
There was a fix on yesterday's game.

29:50.593 --> 29:51.593
Maybe today's as well.

29:51.594 --> 29:53.261
No one makes a fix in this town

29:53.262 --> 29:54.929
without my permission
and a commission.

29:54.930 --> 29:56.530
Well, I have a name.

29:57.432 --> 29:58.600
George Windsor.

29:58.601 --> 30:00.935
Would have thought
his majesty would be more

30:00.936 --> 30:02.604
of a high stakes poker type.

30:02.605 --> 30:04.272
He has $2,000 on the Comets.

30:04.273 --> 30:06.039
If he wins, he cleans you out.

30:07.442 --> 30:09.043
Uh!

30:09.044 --> 30:11.279
So now you're an expert
on my business?

30:11.280 --> 30:13.615
He had the star player
Dorothy Lloyd in his pocket.

30:13.616 --> 30:15.950
- Not possible.
- I have it on good authority.

30:15.951 --> 30:18.286
- She was going to fix the game.
- Dorothy walked into my shop

30:18.287 --> 30:21.054
and made a bet on her own team
to win in a shutout.

30:21.956 --> 30:23.124
She changed her mind.

30:23.125 --> 30:24.626
She ain't my concern.

30:24.627 --> 30:27.795
But some twobit mook trying
to make a fix in my town

30:27.796 --> 30:29.796
without my permission? That is.

30:30.798 --> 30:32.800
You find him and
you bring him back to me.

30:32.801 --> 30:35.902
And maybe I'll reconsider
having Dario break your legs.

30:36.971 --> 30:38.973
I'll find George Windsor.

30:38.974 --> 30:39.974
You can bet on it.

30:52.333 --> 30:54.802
So, after getting an earful
from Redwood at the club,

30:54.803 --> 30:56.471
Dorothy must have changed her mind

30:56.472 --> 30:57.839
and told 'King George' she was out.

30:57.840 --> 31:00.675
So he beat her up in the alley
so she could miss the game.

31:00.676 --> 31:02.510
He's got a $28,000 payday on this.

31:02.511 --> 31:04.145
- A lot at stake.
- We have to believe

31:04.146 --> 31:05.947
that one other dirty player
in still his pocket.

31:05.948 --> 31:07.982
Coach and I will be watching
with eagle eyes.

31:07.983 --> 31:09.650
If any of the Sparrows
are in on this fix,

31:09.651 --> 31:10.985
we'll spot them.

31:10.986 --> 31:12.987
I'll keep my ears open
in the bleachers.

31:12.988 --> 31:14.489
A gambler this close to a big score

31:14.490 --> 31:15.490
might feel like bragging.

31:15.491 --> 31:16.657
Let's play ball.

31:20.228 --> 31:21.561
Let's go, ladies!

31:22.497 --> 31:25.498
- Strike!
- Yeah, Evelyn!

31:30.671 --> 31:32.507
George Windsor could be anyone.

31:32.508 --> 31:33.508
Anywhere.

31:33.509 --> 31:35.176
He's gonna try to control the game

31:35.177 --> 31:36.443
any way possible.

31:54.962 --> 31:56.464
No extra pressure.

31:56.465 --> 31:59.566
What are we gonna do with her
on top of everything else?

32:00.635 --> 32:02.535
One problem at a time.

32:09.477 --> 32:11.045
Isn't that Detective Greyson?

32:11.046 --> 32:13.246
That might complicate things.

32:19.787 --> 32:21.155
That's an out!

32:21.156 --> 32:23.623
- That was an easy out.
- Nah...

32:25.426 --> 32:26.961
Didn't look dirty to me.

32:26.962 --> 32:28.663
Alright, Evelyn!

32:28.664 --> 32:29.764
Keep it up!

32:33.034 --> 32:35.436
Come on, come on, come on! Come on!

32:35.437 --> 32:37.171
Come on, come on!

32:37.172 --> 32:39.173
- One and a half second!
- Double play!

32:39.174 --> 32:41.108
- Woman on the first!
- Second and right field

32:41.109 --> 32:42.209
look clean.

32:43.277 --> 32:44.779
Maybe King George
doesn't have another player

32:44.780 --> 32:46.246
in his pocket after all.

32:47.615 --> 32:48.715
It's not over yet.

32:49.617 --> 32:51.118
Ball one!

32:51.119 --> 32:52.620
What the deuce, Evelyn?

32:52.621 --> 32:55.122
Enough of the fat pitches. Come on!

32:55.123 --> 32:56.624
Get it together!

32:56.625 --> 32:57.792
She's getting tired.

32:57.793 --> 32:59.559
Come on, Evelyn!

33:11.472 --> 33:12.573
Ball two!

33:12.574 --> 33:14.976
For Pete's sake, Evelyn!

33:14.977 --> 33:16.143
Time out!

33:16.144 --> 33:17.612
Time!

33:17.613 --> 33:19.480
Do you think there's anything to this?

33:19.481 --> 33:20.815
Uh...

33:20.816 --> 33:22.196
Redwood can be a bit passionate.

33:23.150 --> 33:24.770
Let's just see how this one plays out.

33:26.153 --> 33:28.155
Did you hit your head
and forget the signals?

33:28.156 --> 33:30.157
I was calling for a curve.
Donna can't hit them!

33:30.158 --> 33:31.492
I'm just nervous. Get off my back.

33:31.493 --> 33:33.259
Take your nerves and shove them.

33:34.829 --> 33:36.429
This is the championship game.

33:45.940 --> 33:47.108
Ball three!

33:47.109 --> 33:48.609
Come on, Evelyn!

33:48.610 --> 33:51.045
Whose team are you on?

33:51.046 --> 33:52.879
First Dorothy, now you?

33:54.282 --> 33:56.516
Sounds like Redwood
is pretty convinced.

33:57.952 --> 33:59.153
Alright.

33:59.154 --> 34:00.454
Shaw, I want you to start
warming up quick.

34:00.455 --> 34:02.290
Wait, what? Me?

34:02.291 --> 34:04.292
Are there any other Shaws
on the bench? Yes, you!

34:04.293 --> 34:06.294
Yes, coach. No, Coach!

34:06.295 --> 34:07.828
I can't... I can't...

34:07.829 --> 34:08.929
You said you're a pitcher, right?

34:08.931 --> 34:10.630
Yeah, but in ladies rec league. I...

34:10.632 --> 34:12.492
Well, get out there
and pitch, then. Go on!

34:13.199 --> 34:14.734
Go on! Get warmed up!

34:19.806 --> 34:21.908
Redwood! What's going on?

34:22.576 --> 34:23.978
She's dirty.

34:23.978 --> 34:27.148
Can't trust anyone anymore.
I swear! It ain't even worth it.

34:27.149 --> 34:29.984
- How do you know?
- I already told you.

34:29.985 --> 34:31.485
A catcher always knows.

34:31.485 --> 34:33.487
She's not even being smart about it.

34:33.487 --> 34:35.588
Ignoring all the signals.
It's obvious.

34:37.324 --> 34:39.493
Shaw holds the Comets
for the next two winnings,

34:39.494 --> 34:42.195
- we win it all.
- Good luck.

34:43.431 --> 34:44.398
Come on!

34:44.399 --> 34:46.199
Mary!

34:47.802 --> 34:50.071
Your girl better be up for this.

34:50.072 --> 34:51.605
Come on, Mary!

34:51.606 --> 34:52.773
Bring the steamboat!

34:52.774 --> 34:54.206
Toot-toot!

34:57.345 --> 34:59.780
Sixty feet, six inches.

34:59.781 --> 35:00.881
Come on, Shaw.

35:04.919 --> 35:07.455
So if George Windsor paid up Evelyn...

35:07.456 --> 35:09.123
He loses his ace in the hole.

35:09.124 --> 35:10.791
He's going to show himself.

35:10.792 --> 35:11.826
I'm going to look for him.

35:11.827 --> 35:13.794
I'll go talk to Evelyn.
Just be careful.

35:13.795 --> 35:15.375
You saw what this guy did to Dorothy.

35:16.864 --> 35:18.466
Shut out the noise.

35:18.467 --> 35:20.800
Just focus on the ball.

35:22.636 --> 35:24.137
It's just another game.

35:25.306 --> 35:26.974
Sixty feet, six inches.

35:26.975 --> 35:28.741
Just breathe.

35:33.147 --> 35:34.482
Strike!

35:34.483 --> 35:36.550
Nice one, Rookie!

35:36.551 --> 35:38.585
Come on, Mary! Throw a touchdown!

35:44.425 --> 35:46.761
Redwood says you were putting
the fix on this game.

35:46.762 --> 35:49.096
Redwood's got a big mouth
and a small brain.

35:49.097 --> 35:50.464
Is that how you want to be known?

35:50.465 --> 35:53.066
Another dirty ballplayer
like the Black Sox?

35:54.101 --> 35:55.636
You ever play through a bad hamstring

35:55.637 --> 35:57.104
and then find out
at the end of the week

35:57.105 --> 35:58.272
the team can't make payroll?

35:58.273 --> 35:59.640
No?

35:59.641 --> 36:00.874
Then what do you know?

36:01.776 --> 36:04.111
So you double cross your own team?

36:04.112 --> 36:05.780
I ain't admitting to nothing.

36:05.781 --> 36:07.448
The cleats alone will land you in jail

36:07.449 --> 36:08.482
if I prove that you did it.

36:08.483 --> 36:09.750
I never touched... Listen.

36:09.751 --> 36:11.372
Dorothy knew what she was
getting herself into.

36:11.373 --> 36:12.620
She came to her senses.

36:12.621 --> 36:14.789
No. What Dorothy did
was hang me out to dry.

36:14.790 --> 36:15.890
She got selfish.

36:16.957 --> 36:18.224
Excuse-me.

36:20.461 --> 36:21.462
Ball one!

36:21.463 --> 36:23.429
Sorry, excuse-me.

36:24.598 --> 36:27.133
Buddy, I got money here.
I'm paying good money.

36:28.169 --> 36:30.805
Dorothy is dead
and someone is responsible.

36:30.806 --> 36:32.739
Yeah, someone is. And it ain't me.

36:35.276 --> 36:36.644
Hey, Brody, what's going on?

36:36.645 --> 36:37.978
You've got a line
of customers waiting.

36:37.979 --> 36:39.746
Just watching the game.

36:43.718 --> 36:45.518
George Windsor...

36:50.391 --> 36:52.793
But if we can't find
this George Windsor,

36:52.794 --> 36:54.095
then I'll hand you over to the police.

36:54.096 --> 36:55.429
You can't do that.

36:55.430 --> 36:56.530
All I did was pitch.

37:00.102 --> 37:01.335
What're you looking at?

37:01.336 --> 37:03.604
Nothing. You know what?
I'm not so hungry after all.

37:03.605 --> 37:04.805
Actually, hold on a minute.

37:04.806 --> 37:07.574
Sorry folks. Sold out.
Closing up shop.

37:08.676 --> 37:10.611
You really want to hang
for some gambler

37:10.612 --> 37:11.878
who paid you a few bucks?

37:14.615 --> 37:17.118
He promised to pay us $500 each.

37:17.119 --> 37:18.252
You have to understand.

37:18.253 --> 37:20.321
That's more than I make
in an entire season.

37:20.322 --> 37:21.655
I need a name.

37:24.458 --> 37:25.459
Brody.

37:25.460 --> 37:27.360
The hot dog guy.

37:59.426 --> 38:01.494
Ball one!

38:11.272 --> 38:13.039
- It's over, Brody.
- He's got a gun!

38:14.108 --> 38:15.409
I've worked too hard for this.

38:15.410 --> 38:18.312
Actually, you just flipped
hot dogs and threatened women.

38:18.313 --> 38:20.114
You're going to go tell
your little friend on the mound

38:20.115 --> 38:21.949
to quit pitching so well or this one

38:21.950 --> 38:23.484
is gonna join Dorothy in the morgue.

38:23.485 --> 38:24.718
Well, I've got another friend here.

38:24.719 --> 38:26.453
I'm sure you know her.
Bessie Starkman.

38:26.454 --> 38:28.221
She knows about your scam.

38:29.290 --> 38:30.357
Her plan is to make sure

38:30.358 --> 38:31.959
the rest of your short miserable life

38:31.960 --> 38:33.460
is in extreme pain.

38:33.461 --> 38:35.129
You're lying.

38:35.130 --> 38:36.429
She's right over there.

38:41.635 --> 38:43.169
Home run!

38:45.072 --> 38:46.574
What now? We can't just...

38:46.575 --> 38:47.575
give him over to her, can we?

38:47.576 --> 38:48.909
You keep an eye on him.

38:48.910 --> 38:50.110
I'll deal with Bessie.

39:08.246 --> 39:09.247
So...

39:09.248 --> 39:10.847
You got someone for me?

39:12.417 --> 39:13.952
Detective Greyson!

39:13.953 --> 39:15.186
Drake?

39:15.187 --> 39:18.522
I have a prestent for you
behind the hot dog stand.

39:19.424 --> 39:21.024
You might need a stretcher.

39:22.594 --> 39:24.094
My partner's there. She'll explain.

39:24.963 --> 39:27.098
You turn up in the strangest of places

39:27.099 --> 39:28.532
with the strangest people.

39:29.601 --> 39:30.867
Excuse-me.

39:31.836 --> 39:35.340
That was a very bad play.

39:35.341 --> 39:37.609
I said that I would catch King George.

39:37.610 --> 39:38.943
I never said
that I would hand him over.

39:38.944 --> 39:40.478
That part of the deal was implied.

39:40.479 --> 39:42.480
That's the problem
with verbal agreements.

39:42.481 --> 39:45.517
I'm not a pawn to be used,
Frankie Drake.

39:45.518 --> 39:46.883
I'm a queen.

39:47.952 --> 39:49.386
And now, I'm an enemy.

40:08.306 --> 40:09.507
Come on, Mary!

40:09.508 --> 40:12.109
She's a palooka!
Throw it straight at her face!

40:17.315 --> 40:18.983
Strike!

40:18.984 --> 40:19.903
Come on, Mary!

40:19.904 --> 40:21.486
She's on fire.

40:21.487 --> 40:22.820
Four to three for the Sparrows.

40:22.821 --> 40:24.589
Two out and the bases are full.

40:24.590 --> 40:25.823
- Loaded.
- Naw,

40:25.824 --> 40:27.325
they can't serve booze here.

40:27.326 --> 40:30.427
No, I mean... Never mind.

40:31.496 --> 40:32.596
Well, that was fun.

40:33.665 --> 40:35.166
Did Greyson say thank you?

40:35.167 --> 40:36.935
Well, he was a little bewildered,

40:36.936 --> 40:38.603
but he could appreciate the easy bust.

40:38.604 --> 40:41.204
- How's our girl doing?
- She's dominating.

40:42.607 --> 40:44.275
Two more strikes, Shaw.

40:44.276 --> 40:45.944
Just breathe.

40:45.945 --> 40:47.244
It's just another game.

40:52.617 --> 40:53.784
Oh no!

40:55.019 --> 40:57.121
If that drops in,
Comets will take the lead!

40:58.691 --> 41:01.726
Foul ball! Strike two!

41:01.727 --> 41:04.462
This game is one cruel mistress.

41:04.463 --> 41:06.297
OK. One more strike

41:06.298 --> 41:07.764
and the Sparrows win it all.

41:10.969 --> 41:13.470
OK, this is it. Just breathe.

41:14.806 --> 41:16.406
Come on, Mary!

41:17.809 --> 41:19.409
Come on, Shaw. One more strike.

41:23.481 --> 41:24.916
- Ball three!
- Time out!

41:24.917 --> 41:26.083
Time!

41:27.885 --> 41:29.821
- Ball three!
- Did you see that?

41:29.822 --> 41:31.489
Focus.

41:31.490 --> 41:32.657
Right now, you have one job.

41:32.658 --> 41:35.193
And that's to throw the stupide ball

41:35.194 --> 41:36.359
over the stupid plate!

41:38.429 --> 41:40.063
OK. For Dorothy.

41:41.599 --> 41:42.699
For her.

41:47.672 --> 41:48.973
One more strike.

41:48.974 --> 41:50.707
Sixty feet, six inches.

41:53.111 --> 41:54.377
This is for Dorothy.

41:55.780 --> 41:57.447
Just breathe.

41:59.117 --> 42:00.383
Come on, Mary!

42:07.125 --> 42:08.126
Just breathe.

42:08.127 --> 42:10.227
Sixty feet, six inches.

42:16.134 --> 42:18.603
Strike three!

42:33.551 --> 42:35.219
Mary! You were amazing!

42:35.220 --> 42:36.754
Wait, wait! What about the case?

42:36.755 --> 42:38.356
We got him. Enjoy this!

42:38.357 --> 42:40.758
I was hoping you would say that!

42:40.759 --> 42:42.427
Eat your heart out, Babe Ruth.

42:42.428 --> 42:43.928
There's a new babe in town!

42:43.929 --> 42:46.264
This is equally
exhilarating and nauseating

42:46.265 --> 42:47.432
at the same time!

42:47.433 --> 42:49.093
I just want to say thank you.

42:49.767 --> 42:51.368
It was a team effort, right?

42:52.637 --> 42:54.017
Dorothy would have loved this.

42:55.440 --> 42:57.460
I think she would have
wanted you to have this.

43:01.279 --> 43:02.879
This means a lot.

43:03.781 --> 43:04.782
Enjoy this.

43:04.783 --> 43:06.716
She'd want you to.
