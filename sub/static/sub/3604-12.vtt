his sketchbook to

Yeah, but how?

Some kind of drug.
I'm told it's safe.

and save Hiro.
We got to find the formula.

36:01.952 --> 36:03.692
How do we
find the formula?

36:09.084 --> 36:10.199
Doctor.

36:59.385 --> 37:01.546
Ready to change the world?

37:13.482 --> 37:14.847
ID, please.

37:25.452 --> 37:28.740
VVerneed
50 doses to begin,
one for every Marine.

37:28.831 --> 37:32.665
We'll just try it on
one first. Let's make
sure this thing works.

37:33.001 --> 37:34.332
No offense.

37:35.838 --> 37:37.328
What is it?

37:38.340 --> 37:39.671
Nothing.

37:40.342 --> 37:45.177
Just a minor inconvenience.
Call your first Marine.
I'll be back.

37:49.393 --> 37:53.227
Peter, I'm glad you're here.
Nathan and I have just been...

37:56.567 --> 37:58.398
Don't be ridiculous.

38:09.371 --> 38:12.454
So, you're here
to kill me.

38:12.833 --> 38:14.619
I'm here to stop you.

38:14.835 --> 38:18.874
Creating abilities
like this, giving them out,

38:19.381 --> 38:21.997
you'll destroy the world.
In your opinion.

38:22.092 --> 38:24.708
I've seen it.
This ends now.

38:25.220 --> 38:28.383
I don't think you have
the nerve to kill me, Peter.

38:30.350 --> 38:31.339
(GUN COCKING)

38:38.066 --> 38:40.682
I like your choice.
Very all-American.

38:41.236 --> 38:44.524
We could put him
on a poster.
Where's my father?

38:44.865 --> 38:48.153
We don't need him.
You're in charge, remember?

38:52.206 --> 38:53.742
All right.
Let's do this.

39:01.840 --> 39:04.502
What the hell
happened to you?
MOHINDER: Mistake.

39:04.593 --> 39:07.255
Hopefully, this formula
will fix all that.

39:07.387 --> 39:09.673
Wait. What's in there?
It’s all right, Scott.

39:09.765 --> 39:10.800
Who is this guy?

39:12.893 --> 39:14.224
(GRUNTING)

39:14.478 --> 39:15.467
(GASPING)

39:41.755 --> 39:44.963
NATHAN: What's happening?
I'm not sure.

39:49.304 --> 39:52.922
He's too strong.
I cannot hold
his powers back.

39:53.225 --> 39:55.716
Listen to me, son.
There is another way.

39:55.811 --> 39:57.722
The formula is ready.
Nathan is here.

39:57.813 --> 40:00.395
I can give you
your abilities back.
We can start over.

40:00.482 --> 40:01.471
No. Wait!
Peter!

40:01.608 --> 40:04.600
Just wait.
Shoot him now.

40:05.153 --> 40:07.644
That's your problem, son.

40:07.739 --> 40:09.650
Too much thought,
not enough action.

40:09.741 --> 40:10.730
(GROANS)

40:10.826 --> 40:12.532
How could you be my son?

40:26.258 --> 40:28.670
Hello, Arthur.
Gabriel.

40:30.012 --> 40:32.173
You're here.
I am.

40:33.140 --> 40:35.597
No place I'd rather be
than with family.

40:39.521 --> 40:41.352
Are you really my family?

40:42.774 --> 40:44.184
Of course.

40:46.278 --> 40:47.984
I'm your father.

40:50.866 --> 40:52.197
No, you're not.

40:55.746 --> 40:57.702
Now I know the truth.

41:01.418 --> 41:03.124
You're not a killer, Peter.

41:05.380 --> 41:06.335
lam.

41:06.423 --> 41:07.412
(BULLET WHOOSHES)

41:09.343 --> 41:11.004
(PANTING)

41:13.347 --> 41:15.303
There'll be
no need for that.

41:15.390 --> 41:18.507
I'm not gonna kill you.
You don't have anything
I need anymore.

41:21.730 --> 41:26.224
I'm sorry, Peter.
Your father was
the one who had to die.

41:26.318 --> 41:27.683
Go after Sylar.

41:39.748 --> 41:41.113
It's over.

41:55.097 --> 41:56.337
(GASPING)

41:57.891 --> 41:59.472
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

42:01.812 --> 42:03.177
How do you feel?

42:25.919 --> 42:26.908
(GASPS)

42:33.343 --> 42:34.719
Ifeelgood.
