WEBVTT

00:03.378 --> 00:05.378
Captain's starlog, supplemental.

00:05.587 --> 00:08.420
I'm beginning to wonder
if inviting the Kreetassans aboard

00:08.629 --> 00:09.920
was such a good idea.

00:10.128 --> 00:13.337
It's been a challenging morning,
to say the least.

00:16.337 --> 00:17.628
Did you get that?

00:17.836 --> 00:20.378
"Insult." Some kind of an insult.

00:20.587 --> 00:22.503
He's insulting us,
or we insulted them?

00:22.711 --> 00:24.711
I'm not sure.

00:25.586 --> 00:27.627
Ask what we did wrong.

00:34.711 --> 00:37.669
- Well?
- "You eat like you mate"?

00:37.919 --> 00:39.502
You sure that thing's working?

00:41.586 --> 00:43.169
I think they wanna leave.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.919
That much is obvious.

00:47.377 --> 00:51.711
Whatever we've done
to offend you...

00:53.044 --> 00:54.335
...I apologize.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:23.210 --> 01:25.418
Well, this is one for the books.

01:25.627 --> 01:28.252
Briefest first contact.

01:45.335 --> 01:50.667
"It's been a long road
Gettin' from there to here"

01:53.126 --> 01:56.542
"It's been a long time"

01:56.751 --> 02:00.584
"But my time is finally near"

02:00.792 --> 02:05.043
"And I will see my dream
Come alive at last"

02:05.250 --> 02:08.167
"I will touch the sky"

02:08.375 --> 02:12.167
"And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more"

02:12.375 --> 02:15.375
"No, they're not gonna change my mind"

02:15.584 --> 02:20.292
"'Cause I've got faith of the heart"

02:20.500 --> 02:23.417
"I'm going where my heart will take me"

02:23.625 --> 02:28.208
"I've got faith to believe"

02:28.417 --> 02:31.000
"I can do anything"

02:31.208 --> 02:35.708
"I've got strength of the soul"

02:35.916 --> 02:38.791
"And no one's gonna bend or break me"

02:39.000 --> 02:44.333
"I can reach any star"

02:44.708 --> 02:48.457
"I've got faith"

02:48.666 --> 02:52.375
"I've got faith"

02:52.583 --> 02:57.374
"Faith of the heart"

03:17.823 --> 03:19.864
Does anybody hear that?

03:20.073 --> 03:21.699
What, the static?

03:21.907 --> 03:25.241
Frequency distortions
mixed in with the static.

03:25.449 --> 03:28.075
You've got better ears
than we do.

03:28.283 --> 03:29.866
It's coming from the com system.

03:30.075 --> 03:31.951
Have you run a diagnostic?

03:32.159 --> 03:33.784
Twice.

03:35.159 --> 03:38.077
I guess today is just not my day.

03:38.785 --> 03:40.493
How's the translation
coming along?

03:40.701 --> 03:42.409
Slowly.

03:43.494 --> 03:45.494
Their word for "eat"?

03:45.702 --> 03:46.994
What about it?

03:47.202 --> 03:51.912
With emphasis on the
first syllable... it means "to mate."

03:52.870 --> 03:55.746
I can see how that might cause
some confusion over dinner.

03:55.954 --> 03:58.287
Context is critical
in every language,

03:58.496 --> 04:01.747
but Kreetassan has the most subtle
variations I've ever seen.

04:01.954 --> 04:05.247
The same word can have
a dozen different meanings.

04:05.581 --> 04:09.247
We rely on you to recognize
the difference, ensign.

04:10.039 --> 04:11.665
You think it was my fault?

04:11.873 --> 04:13.998
- I didn't say that.
- You implied it.

04:14.207 --> 04:17.458
I simply noted that linguistic matters
fall within your responsibility.

04:18.249 --> 04:21.333
For all we know, it was Mr Tucker's
table manners that offended them.

04:21.541 --> 04:23.791
But you think if I'd picked
up the language faster,

04:24.000 --> 04:25.833
they might have
not stormed off the ship.

04:26.042 --> 04:28.251
There's no need
to react emotionally.

04:28.460 --> 04:29.792
Try to learn from failure.

04:30.001 --> 04:33.044
It could help your next first contact
be more successful.

04:33.835 --> 04:35.336
Thanks.

04:36.460 --> 04:37.960
Commander.

04:38.169 --> 04:42.128
I'm picking up some kind of
interference on the com system.

04:42.336 --> 04:44.587
A high-frequency distortion.

04:44.795 --> 04:47.462
- Is it a problem?
- Mostly just irritating.

04:47.670 --> 04:49.462
I'll track it down
first thing in the morning.

04:49.670 --> 04:50.963
Thanks.

04:53.754 --> 04:56.297
- Is he in there?
- Yes.

04:57.213 --> 04:58.505
How's his mood?

04:58.714 --> 05:00.755
Now might not be the best time.

05:02.631 --> 05:04.715
I'll take my chances.

05:10.340 --> 05:12.049
It better be important.

05:14.091 --> 05:18.300
Prime rib tonight
with real horseradish.

05:18.801 --> 05:21.342
Thanks, I'll have the steward
send some up.

05:22.050 --> 05:24.759
Thought we'd set a course
for this brown dwarf system.

05:24.968 --> 05:28.343
- Looks interesting.
- I can't wait.

05:29.718 --> 05:33.386
In the meantime, why don't we
shoot a little Nine Ball? You can break.

05:33.594 --> 05:35.095
Maybe later.

05:39.303 --> 05:43.054
I was gonna save this
for a rainy day, but...

05:46.805 --> 05:49.471
Stanford versus Texas.

05:54.722 --> 05:55.889
The finals?

05:56.098 --> 05:58.556
Fresh out of the subspace mailbag.

05:59.099 --> 06:02.724
You've been threatening to teach me
the finer points of the game.

06:06.265 --> 06:08.517
Unless you're too busy
with your brown dwarfs.

06:32.020 --> 06:34.811
What if they just don't like
being touched?

06:35.020 --> 06:36.480
Remember how uncomfortable
they looked

06:36.687 --> 06:39.063
when the captain tried
to shake their hands?

06:39.396 --> 06:41.397
They looked that way
the entire time.

06:41.606 --> 06:44.022
Besides, they didn't
really lose their temper

06:44.230 --> 06:47.231
until they arrived here
in the mess hall.

06:52.191 --> 06:53.899
Are you staying
for the movie tonight?

06:54.107 --> 06:55.523
What's playing?

06:55.732 --> 06:57.398
Wages of Fear.

06:57.607 --> 06:59.858
Classic French film.

07:01.816 --> 07:03.233
No, you'll like it.

07:03.442 --> 07:05.483
Things blow up.

07:06.234 --> 07:08.109
Sounds fun.

07:08.317 --> 07:09.651
Hoshi?

07:09.860 --> 07:11.359
No, thanks,
I'm turning in early.

07:12.776 --> 07:14.192
We might need a translator.

07:14.401 --> 07:17.110
Those subtitles go by pretty fast.

07:17.444 --> 07:19.235
I've had enough language
problems for one day.

07:42.615 --> 07:44.365
We're gonna have
to sit in the back.

07:44.574 --> 07:46.490
One minute.

07:46.823 --> 07:48.241
I hate missing the beginning.

07:48.449 --> 07:51.408
It's on the computer.
You can watch it whenever you want.

07:51.615 --> 07:53.032
It's not the same.

07:53.241 --> 07:56.658
You don't wanna go back and see the
first part after you know how it ends.

07:58.491 --> 08:01.076
The power just went
out on D deck.

08:01.326 --> 08:03.201
Cargo Bay Two.

08:03.410 --> 08:05.285
The lighting grid's down.

08:05.493 --> 08:07.160
It's probably just a blown relay.

08:07.368 --> 08:08.952
Leave it for the night shift.

08:09.160 --> 08:13.161
If it's just a blown relay,
it'll take you ten minutes to fix.

08:13.494 --> 08:14.911
Here.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.787
The com's out too.

08:24.120 --> 08:25.579
Two and a half hours?

08:25.788 --> 08:27.789
Two hours and 24 minutes.

08:28.080 --> 08:31.413
That seems awfully long for a movie
about four men in a truck.

08:31.622 --> 08:34.748
- You'll be on the edge of your seat.
- You promised me explosions.

08:34.957 --> 08:36.664
Don't worry.

08:55.001 --> 08:56.293
This is all wrong.

09:01.085 --> 09:03.044
- Reed to bridge.
- Go ahead, lieutenant.

09:03.252 --> 09:05.044
We're trying to watch
a movie down here,

09:05.252 --> 09:07.628
but instead we're being treated
to a view of you.

09:07.836 --> 09:10.669
So unless you're planning on giving us
a little song and dance,

09:10.878 --> 09:13.004
maybe you could see
what's gone wrong.

09:14.420 --> 09:15.754
Come on.

09:15.962 --> 09:17.255
Come on.

09:17.463 --> 09:19.005
Yes!

09:21.421 --> 09:23.131
How deep's the pool?

09:23.339 --> 09:25.839
Deep enough so that no one
can touch the bottom.

09:26.048 --> 09:28.423
I didn't know it was
such a rough game.

09:28.631 --> 09:32.548
Think of it as one part basketball,
one part swimming...

09:33.256 --> 09:34.632
...and one part wrestling.

09:34.841 --> 09:38.966
And I thought it was just a bunch
of guys screwing around in a pool.

10:52.603 --> 10:54.478
Engineering.

10:55.770 --> 10:57.978
Michael, is that you?

10:59.895 --> 11:01.479
Hello?

11:06.271 --> 11:08.230
Nice goal!

11:08.439 --> 11:10.231
You see the way
number 12 set him up?

11:10.439 --> 11:12.397
Wait, he's called
the point man, right?

11:12.606 --> 11:13.606
Very good.

11:13.813 --> 11:15.773
I told you, best sport in the world.

11:15.981 --> 11:18.648
Well, I'll still take a great
off-tackle run out of the backfield,

11:18.856 --> 11:20.690
but I can see how you can
get hooked on this.

11:20.899 --> 11:22.232
Thanks for thinking of it.

11:22.815 --> 11:24.483
My pleasure.

11:24.815 --> 11:28.441
Now, keep watching while Texas
trounces your sorry California butts.

11:30.901 --> 11:33.276
You haven't watched
the end of this, have you?

11:33.859 --> 11:35.734
Of course not.

11:47.737 --> 11:49.278
Hello?

11:49.778 --> 11:51.070
What the hell was that?

11:51.278 --> 11:54.321
Oh, number eight on Texas
just fouled one of my boys.

11:54.529 --> 11:56.654
He's gonna be ejected
for 20 seconds.

11:56.863 --> 11:59.530
Is that fair?
It gives your guys an advantage.

11:59.739 --> 12:01.864
Well, that's the point.

12:06.031 --> 12:09.824
I don't suppose it'd be practical
to put a pool on the ship.

12:11.073 --> 12:14.490
I wouldn't wanna be taking a swim
if the gravity plating went off-line.

12:15.031 --> 12:16.533
No. No.

12:16.741 --> 12:19.991
- Kelly to the captain.
- Go ahead.

12:20.199 --> 12:22.908
Sir, I'm in Cargo Bay Two,

12:23.409 --> 12:25.700
and there's some kind
of life form in here.

12:26.075 --> 12:29.326
- Life form?
- It's got Rostov, sir.

12:29.535 --> 12:31.910
He's still conscious, but he can't...

12:32.119 --> 12:33.577
Crewman?

12:53.163 --> 12:55.039
Weapons to stun.

12:56.330 --> 12:57.956
Captain.

13:45.255 --> 13:46.963
Sir?

14:07.092 --> 14:08.383
Careful.

14:12.343 --> 14:14.384
The light.

14:26.303 --> 14:27.470
She's alive.

14:28.303 --> 14:30.095
Captain.

14:42.180 --> 14:43.597
Leave.

14:44.097 --> 14:45.723
Crewman?

14:45.931 --> 14:47.348
Leave!

15:02.559 --> 15:04.184
Captain!

15:26.062 --> 15:28.062
Get out of here!

15:28.396 --> 15:30.063
Go!

15:59.943 --> 16:02.026
This thing appears to be growing.

16:02.235 --> 16:04.777
There's no telling if it'll
get out of the cargo bay.

16:04.985 --> 16:06.902
I recommend we evacuate
the entire deck.

16:07.110 --> 16:08.443
How did it get on board?

16:08.652 --> 16:11.819
The last time we opened the airlock,
we were docked with the Kreetassans.

16:12.028 --> 16:13.653
You think they left us
a little souvenir?

16:13.861 --> 16:15.196
Our encounter didn't go well,

16:15.403 --> 16:18.445
but I doubt we gave them
reason to attack us.

16:18.653 --> 16:21.237
We're not even certain
that the organism's hostile.

16:21.446 --> 16:23.613
You didn't see that thing
go after the captain!

16:23.821 --> 16:25.697
It seemed hostile enough to me.

16:25.906 --> 16:28.113
The Kreetassans might know
something about this thing.

16:28.322 --> 16:31.448
I can start scanning for their ship,
try to pick up their warp trail.

16:33.364 --> 16:35.823
We'll need to communicate
with them better than last time.

16:36.198 --> 16:37.532
I'll do my best.

16:39.157 --> 16:41.240
T'Pol to Dr Phlox. Report.

16:41.490 --> 16:42.991
I'm preparing to examine
the specimen.

16:43.199 --> 16:44.617
Would you care to observe?

16:44.824 --> 16:47.241
Yes. Stand by.

16:53.493 --> 16:55.993
You'll note that even though
it's been severed from its body,

16:56.201 --> 16:57.493
it survives independently,

16:57.701 --> 17:02.161
not unlike the common earthworm
or the Neethian cradlefish.

17:08.493 --> 17:09.911
Do you think that's wise, doctor?

17:10.371 --> 17:12.871
Possibly not, but I'm going to need
a tissue sample

17:13.079 --> 17:16.579
if I hope to learn more
about its physiology.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.913
That'll be quite enough.

17:32.666 --> 17:34.416
This is no earthworm.

17:34.624 --> 17:37.541
- Doctor?
- Look at the synaptic activity.

17:37.791 --> 17:40.417
This organism possesses
a very sophisticated nervous system.

17:40.667 --> 17:43.960
It could be capable
of higher mental functions.

17:44.543 --> 17:47.042
If it's intelligent, maybe we can
communicate with it.

17:47.251 --> 17:48.543
The frequency distortions,

17:48.751 --> 17:51.752
they look a lot like the phonetic
patterns in certain Andorian dialects.

17:51.960 --> 17:53.293
With all due respect, Hoshi,

17:53.502 --> 17:55.794
we're not talking about
nouns and verbs here.

17:56.002 --> 17:59.169
It could take you days to learn
a language like that, even if it is one.

17:59.378 --> 18:01.671
What other choice do we have?

18:02.836 --> 18:04.795
Give me a chance.

18:05.337 --> 18:07.213
I'm sorry, ensign,
there isn't enough time.

18:07.421 --> 18:09.963
- Sub-commander...
- We need to neutralize it quickly.

18:10.171 --> 18:12.922
- You said phase-pistols had no effect?
- None that I could tell.

18:13.130 --> 18:15.130
Then I suggest you find
a method that does.

18:15.339 --> 18:17.006
If I may,

18:17.256 --> 18:18.756
the organism
is highly photosensitive.

18:18.964 --> 18:23.548
A sustained burst of EM radiation
might be enough to stun the creature.

18:24.049 --> 18:26.507
Can you assemble
some EM emitters?

18:26.882 --> 18:29.341
Lt'll take a few minutes.

19:04.764 --> 19:06.221
Why doesn't it just kill us?

19:06.804 --> 19:08.764
Take it easy.

19:09.473 --> 19:12.640
I'm sure T'Pol and Malcolm
are doing everything they can

19:12.848 --> 19:15.056
to get us out of here.

19:17.598 --> 19:20.932
Can either of you
see Crewman Kelly?

19:23.349 --> 19:26.683
- Yes, sir.
- How's she look?

19:28.933 --> 19:30.559
She's still breathing.

19:34.642 --> 19:35.977
Zabel's still unconscious.

19:36.977 --> 19:39.518
- Captain?
- Yeah.

19:39.727 --> 19:42.936
I imagine in a situation like this
they'd cancel the movie.

19:46.104 --> 19:47.854
I imagine so.

19:49.270 --> 19:51.562
I really wanted to see it.

19:51.896 --> 19:57.062
Yves Montand driving explosives
through the mountains.

19:57.272 --> 20:00.230
I'll make sure they reschedule it
for next week.

20:00.647 --> 20:02.397
Thank you, sir.

20:33.027 --> 20:35.069
It's working.

20:44.904 --> 20:47.446
Bridge, something's wrong.

20:49.113 --> 20:50.197
Shut off the emitters.

20:50.404 --> 20:51.738
- Doctor?
- Shut them off.

20:53.322 --> 20:54.656
Off.

21:02.198 --> 21:03.740
- What happened?
- Their nervous systems

21:03.948 --> 21:05.407
appear to be linked
to the organism's.

21:05.616 --> 21:07.741
They're sharing autonomic functions,
neural impulses.

21:07.949 --> 21:11.241
If we continue firing, we could end up
killing our own people.

21:12.325 --> 21:14.408
Mr Reed,

21:14.617 --> 21:16.284
withdraw your team.

21:16.534 --> 21:18.242
Understood.

21:26.369 --> 21:28.244
The rate of symbiosis
is increasing.

21:28.453 --> 21:30.161
If we don't find a way
to extract them soon,

21:30.369 --> 21:32.537
their systems will be
too integrated with the creature.

21:32.745 --> 21:34.870
I won't be able to separate them.

21:37.746 --> 21:40.330
You wanted a chance
to communicate.

21:40.537 --> 21:42.620
I suggest you begin.

21:50.331 --> 21:52.039
How much time do they have?

21:52.248 --> 21:53.581
A few hours at most.

21:53.789 --> 21:56.665
Their metabolic rates are dropping.
Temperature, respiration.

21:56.874 --> 21:59.623
There must be some way
to cut them out of there.

21:59.833 --> 22:02.624
I'm not sure if you appreciate
how alien this creature is.

22:02.833 --> 22:04.125
It's not attacking our crewmen,

22:04.332 --> 22:06.750
it's trying to integrate
them into itself.

22:06.959 --> 22:09.375
The end result's the same.

22:09.584 --> 22:11.585
At some point
in the very near future,

22:11.793 --> 22:15.002
there won't be six life forms
in that cargo bay.

22:15.209 --> 22:17.585
There'll only be one.

22:18.460 --> 22:21.585
If that thing continues to grow, we're
gonna have to find a way to contain it.

22:21.794 --> 22:23.003
Do you have a suggestion?

22:23.211 --> 22:25.503
Starfleet's been working on
creating a stable EM barrier

22:25.712 --> 22:26.795
for the last five years.

22:27.002 --> 22:28.045
- A forcefield.
- Right.

22:28.254 --> 22:30.712
They just haven't found a way
to control the particle density.

22:30.920 --> 22:32.379
All the specs are in the database.

22:32.587 --> 22:35.046
I've been trying to jury-rig
a prototype of my own.

22:35.255 --> 22:36.712
And?

22:36.921 --> 22:38.046
I've got it stable enough

22:38.255 --> 22:40.880
to absorb a phase-pistol blast
60 percent of the time.

22:41.506 --> 22:43.630
I think I can improve on that.

22:43.839 --> 22:45.549
I suggest you work quickly.

22:50.132 --> 22:51.258
I think I found them.

22:51.466 --> 22:54.216
- Where?
- Point-five-two light years from here.

22:54.424 --> 22:56.092
- Lay in a course.
- I already have.

22:56.300 --> 22:59.175
I've been sending out hails,
but we're still out of com range.

22:59.383 --> 23:01.967
Let me know
as soon as they respond.

23:07.676 --> 23:09.010
Any progress?

23:09.219 --> 23:11.968
Believe me,
you'd be the first to know.

23:13.302 --> 23:14.719
I'm sorry.

23:14.928 --> 23:17.135
It's frustrating.
I'm not having a lot of luck.

23:17.344 --> 23:19.637
The situation requires
expertise, not luck.

23:19.845 --> 23:21.345
Then maybe I don't have
the expertise.

23:21.553 --> 23:24.763
If you don't, no one else
aboard Enterprise does.

23:24.971 --> 23:27.179
I'm doing my best.

23:27.721 --> 23:30.847
It was your suggestion that we attempt
to communicate with it.

23:31.055 --> 23:34.263
If you don't think that's possible,
we'll have to find another solution.

23:34.473 --> 23:37.139
I've made a little progress...

23:37.598 --> 23:41.641
...but our translation matrix isn't
designed for this. Look at it.

23:41.848 --> 23:45.182
It's more like a calculus equation
than a language.

23:47.016 --> 23:51.225
Mathematics is sometimes
considered a form of language.

23:53.850 --> 23:56.684
What I'm trying to say is...

23:57.435 --> 23:59.310
...that I could use help
from someone

23:59.517 --> 24:01.684
with a background
in higher mathematics.

24:04.810 --> 24:06.602
Perhaps I can assist you.

24:26.439 --> 24:29.480
The Texas goalie
can't block to his right

24:29.689 --> 24:32.481
because he keeps
his hands too deep.

24:32.940 --> 24:34.273
How do you know that?

24:34.481 --> 24:38.023
Captain, I know it too...

24:38.232 --> 24:41.023
...and I don't understand anything
about water polo.

24:43.692 --> 24:45.816
It's this life form.

24:46.483 --> 24:49.025
It's linking us together somehow.

24:50.150 --> 24:51.984
We gotta get out!

24:52.192 --> 24:54.026
Calm down.

24:56.943 --> 24:59.902
This thing's gotten inside our heads!

25:00.194 --> 25:01.777
Trip.

25:04.987 --> 25:07.569
Do you know
what I'm thinking about?

25:10.654 --> 25:12.904
Now's not the time to be
thinking about the regionals.

25:13.113 --> 25:14.738
Trip.

25:20.030 --> 25:21.864
Senior year,

25:22.073 --> 25:24.739
North American regionals
against Princeton.

25:24.948 --> 25:26.782
We...

25:27.032 --> 25:29.615
I mean, you were down
by two goals under a minute left.

25:30.740 --> 25:32.157
And what was I thinking?

25:34.115 --> 25:36.241
What was I thinking?

25:38.075 --> 25:39.951
You thought...

25:40.200 --> 25:42.325
...you could win...

25:42.743 --> 25:44.785
...every game.

25:45.117 --> 25:47.701
You always thought
you could win...

25:48.202 --> 25:50.702
...no matter how far behind
you were.

25:50.910 --> 25:52.619
And we did.

25:52.827 --> 25:55.994
We went on to the finals
that year.

25:58.286 --> 26:01.162
As soon as you give up...

26:01.704 --> 26:04.037
...the game's lost.

26:33.043 --> 26:34.625
How's our little friend?

26:34.834 --> 26:36.168
Fast asleep.

26:36.375 --> 26:38.293
It appears to have entered
a dormant state.

26:38.501 --> 26:39.918
Probably a reaction to the shock

26:40.127 --> 26:42.209
of being severed
from the larger organism.

26:42.418 --> 26:43.711
But it's alive?

26:43.919 --> 26:46.711
- Very much so.
- Good.

26:46.919 --> 26:50.295
Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to run
a few tests of my own.

26:51.336 --> 26:53.295
What kind of tests?

26:53.628 --> 26:57.296
I need to determine how much
bioelectric stress it can tolerate.

26:57.504 --> 26:58.838
May I ask why?

26:59.045 --> 27:02.255
I'm trying to create a forcefield
to isolate the cargo bay.

27:02.463 --> 27:03.797
But if it's going to work,

27:04.005 --> 27:06.047
I have to calculate
how much of a jolt it will take

27:06.256 --> 27:08.339
to repel the organism
without killing it

27:08.548 --> 27:10.964
or any of the people it's taken.

27:12.715 --> 27:15.132
If you intend to pummel this
appendage with EM radiation

27:15.340 --> 27:18.258
until it cries for mercy,
I'm afraid I can't permit that.

27:19.049 --> 27:20.341
Why not?

27:20.590 --> 27:22.174
This is more
than just a severed limb.

27:22.383 --> 27:24.925
It exhibits all the signs
of an intelligent being.

27:25.134 --> 27:27.758
Intelligent being or not,
its big brother is in the cargo bay

27:27.967 --> 27:30.385
strangling the captain
and four other crewmen.

27:30.592 --> 27:32.260
If we don't do something
to contain it now,

27:32.467 --> 27:34.219
it could pose a threat
to everyone on board.

27:34.426 --> 27:37.593
There are less invasive ways
to gather the information you need.

27:37.802 --> 27:39.761
- Such as?
- Microcellular analysis.

27:39.970 --> 27:42.011
- How long would that take?
- Less than an hour.

27:42.220 --> 27:44.845
In less than an hour, that thing
could spread across half a deck.

27:45.054 --> 27:48.220
I'm willing to help you, Mr Reed, but
not if it means torturing this organism.

27:48.428 --> 27:49.428
Correct me if I'm wrong,

27:49.637 --> 27:52.763
but isn't our mission to try to better
understand unique forms of life?

27:53.013 --> 27:54.763
Not if they're trying
to kill the captain.

27:55.013 --> 27:57.347
We don't know anything about
this creature's intentions.

27:57.555 --> 27:59.097
I admire your interspecies ethics,

27:59.305 --> 28:01.932
but until Hoshi tells me she's found
a way to communicate with it,

28:02.139 --> 28:04.473
I have to assume
its intentions are hostile.

28:04.681 --> 28:06.056
Now...

28:06.389 --> 28:08.432
...if you don't mind.

28:09.890 --> 28:12.432
If you want information to help
you construct your forcefield,

28:12.641 --> 28:14.433
you'll acquire it
under my supervision.

28:14.642 --> 28:16.558
I'm sure I don't have
to remind you, doctor,

28:16.766 --> 28:18.183
I am the ranking officer here.

28:18.392 --> 28:19.934
Not in my Sickbay,

28:20.142 --> 28:21.808
unless the captain
says otherwise.

28:22.017 --> 28:24.768
The captain is in no condition
to offer an opinion.

28:25.268 --> 28:27.018
Precisely.

28:29.852 --> 28:31.227
Fine.

28:31.436 --> 28:33.311
Your rules.

28:34.894 --> 28:37.062
But we better get to it.

28:39.478 --> 28:41.520
What if we used
a bilateral algorithm?

28:41.729 --> 28:43.687
I already tried.

28:46.105 --> 28:48.147
Did you compensate
for frequency drift?

28:48.354 --> 28:51.396
I wouldn't be much of a com officer
if I didn't.

28:54.023 --> 28:58.024
Allowing your emotions to control you
won't help solve this problem, ensign.

28:58.231 --> 29:01.065
Neither will questioning
everything I do.

29:01.273 --> 29:03.357
You asked for my help.

29:03.566 --> 29:06.774
I didn't ask for you to keep count
of every time I make a mistake

29:06.983 --> 29:08.859
or to second guess
all of my decisions.

29:10.650 --> 29:13.692
As first officer,
it's my duty to supervise you.

29:13.900 --> 29:15.860
This goes beyond duty,
sub-commander.

29:16.109 --> 29:18.818
You've been looking over my shoulder
ever since you came on board.

29:19.025 --> 29:21.527
Double-checking my log entries,
my translations.

29:21.736 --> 29:24.943
- It's my job.
- Is that all we're talking about?

29:25.528 --> 29:28.570
You don't think I belong
on Enterprise, do you?

29:29.902 --> 29:31.903
On the contrary.

29:32.112 --> 29:35.695
It would be a great loss to Starfleet
if you were not a part of this crew.

29:36.654 --> 29:40.029
If you feel I've been unfair
to you, I apologize.

29:40.238 --> 29:42.155
But I hold you
to a high standard, ensign,

29:42.364 --> 29:45.239
because I know you're capable
of achieving it.

29:48.864 --> 29:50.823
Shall we continue?

29:51.739 --> 29:53.365
Yes.

29:58.032 --> 30:00.783
Why don't we take another
look at the subharmonics.

30:00.991 --> 30:03.491
I was thinking we could run them
through the decryption matrix,

30:03.699 --> 30:05.659
see if we can find a pattern.

30:05.909 --> 30:07.826
All I see is numbers, codes.

30:09.367 --> 30:11.451
Any code can be broken.

30:23.994 --> 30:25.328
You hailed us?

30:25.578 --> 30:27.162
You speak English.

30:27.412 --> 30:29.746
We studied your database.
It wasn't dificult.

30:31.371 --> 30:33.121
Okay.

30:33.538 --> 30:36.372
- We have a problem.
- Yes?

30:36.580 --> 30:39.789
There's an alien organism
on our ship.

30:39.997 --> 30:41.039
Yes?

30:41.247 --> 30:44.207
It came aboard around
the same time we saw you.

30:44.415 --> 30:46.540
We were hoping you might know
something about it.

30:47.373 --> 30:49.582
Describe this organism.

30:50.458 --> 30:52.957
Well, it's big.

30:53.166 --> 30:55.875
But it didn't start out that way.

30:56.167 --> 30:59.499
It's like a large mass of tendrils.

31:00.210 --> 31:03.626
- Tendrils?
- Like a giant web.

31:03.876 --> 31:06.252
But it moves and grows.

31:07.585 --> 31:08.960
We have seen this.

31:09.335 --> 31:11.628
- Where?
- On its home world.

31:11.836 --> 31:13.878
Perhaps it attached
itself to our ship.

31:14.086 --> 31:15.502
It wasn't our fault.

31:15.711 --> 31:17.462
Can you tell us
where this planet is?

31:21.795 --> 31:23.629
Apologize.

31:24.796 --> 31:26.254
Excuse me?

31:26.463 --> 31:28.213
We will send you
the coordinates,

31:28.422 --> 31:32.380
but first, you must apologize
to us for your ofence.

31:34.381 --> 31:36.006
That's the thing.

31:36.214 --> 31:38.464
We don't know what we did
to offend you.

31:40.465 --> 31:43.215
On your ship...

31:44.007 --> 31:46.550
...you put food in your mouths.

31:47.049 --> 31:48.216
You mean eat?

31:48.425 --> 31:50.592
Yes, eat.

31:51.717 --> 31:53.384
I don't understand.

31:53.591 --> 31:57.718
It is like mating.
It is very ofensive to us.

31:58.468 --> 32:00.759
We were just eating.

32:00.969 --> 32:02.428
How do you eat?

32:04.136 --> 32:07.553
We eat the same way,
but not in the presence of others.

32:08.803 --> 32:10.137
I see.

32:10.344 --> 32:11.928
Okay.

32:13.221 --> 32:15.387
Please believe me,

32:15.720 --> 32:18.930
we had no idea
that would be offensive to you.

32:19.138 --> 32:21.972
It was simply a misunderstanding.

32:22.179 --> 32:24.847
On behalf of the entire crew,

32:25.056 --> 32:28.430
I sincerely apologize.

32:30.974 --> 32:32.807
Your apology is accepted.

32:34.056 --> 32:35.599
Thank you.

32:39.391 --> 32:42.183
Now, could I have
those coordinates?

33:00.144 --> 33:01.727
Captain.

33:03.312 --> 33:04.603
Yeah?

33:05.520 --> 33:07.938
I feel you've drifted away
over there.

33:09.604 --> 33:12.937
You aren't feeling
much better than I do.

33:19.773 --> 33:21.606
Rostov?

33:27.482 --> 33:28.774
He's out.

33:34.274 --> 33:36.775
When Zefram Cochrane...

33:37.942 --> 33:43.026
...talked about new life
and new civilization...

33:45.192 --> 33:47.485
...do you think this is
what he meant?

33:54.611 --> 33:56.445
Here. Here it is.

33:56.653 --> 33:58.195
I found a third set of repetitions.

33:58.404 --> 34:00.070
Try it.

34:03.447 --> 34:06.405
Just a few more and the UT
can start building a syntax.

34:06.613 --> 34:08.696
Phlox to T'Pol.

34:11.531 --> 34:12.572
Go ahead.

34:12.780 --> 34:14.572
I know you're under
a great deal of pressure,

34:14.781 --> 34:17.447
but Crewman Kelly's metabolic rate
has dropped to a critical level.

34:17.656 --> 34:20.241
Whatever you're planning to do,
you'd better do it soon.

34:20.447 --> 34:22.489
Understood.

34:32.909 --> 34:34.659
Ready, sir.

34:42.786 --> 34:45.369
The particle density's
still fluctuating.

34:45.577 --> 34:47.619
I think the problem is
in the lower left quadrant.

34:47.828 --> 34:49.495
Got it, sir.

34:53.871 --> 34:55.496
Try again.

34:58.204 --> 34:59.789
Better.

35:00.038 --> 35:03.580
- T'Pol to Lieutenant Reed.
- Go ahead.

35:03.789 --> 35:05.498
We've made some progress
on the translation,

35:05.706 --> 35:08.456
but we're going to need to get
into the cargo bay to test it.

35:08.706 --> 35:09.997
Is the forcefield ready?

35:10.206 --> 35:11.873
I'm making the final calibrations now.

35:12.082 --> 35:13.374
You'll have to do it quickly.

35:13.582 --> 35:16.749
Dr Phlox says our people
don't have much time.

35:17.624 --> 35:19.541
Understood.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.542
Captain?

36:33.136 --> 36:36.469
Emitter B's off by
three-point-two microns.

36:53.806 --> 36:56.807
The forcefield's working,
but I can't guarantee how long it'll hold.

36:57.015 --> 37:00.057
- Have you done it?
- We're about to find out.

37:30.812 --> 37:32.728
It just sounds
like a constant tone.

37:32.937 --> 37:34.853
I'm gonna create
distortions in the tone.

37:35.063 --> 37:38.438
Hopefully, the organism will
understand what I'm trying to do.

38:38.739 --> 38:41.114
Come on, just a little more.

38:46.032 --> 38:47.907
I think I've got enough
to try something simple.

38:48.116 --> 38:50.116
Ask what it wants.

39:04.286 --> 39:06.827
- It's talking to us.
- What's it saying?

39:08.244 --> 39:09.995
- Ensign.
- Hold on.

39:10.661 --> 39:13.744
- It's giving us coordinates.
- Its home world?

39:13.995 --> 39:15.537
The Kreetassans
already gave them to us.

39:15.745 --> 39:17.412
These look like the latitude
and longitude.

39:17.620 --> 39:20.120
I think it's trying to give us
an exact location on the planet.

39:20.328 --> 39:23.079
Tell it we're taking it back.

39:33.123 --> 39:35.623
Commander Tucker's
heart rate is increasing.

39:35.872 --> 39:38.499
- Is that good or bad?
- Good.

39:38.707 --> 39:41.832
Crewman Kelly's bio-signs
are stabilizing as well.

40:24.756 --> 40:26.464
Lower the forcefield.

40:28.673 --> 40:30.049
Lieutenant.

40:42.300 --> 40:44.843
Medical team,
report to Cargo Bay Two.

40:45.051 --> 40:46.760
Acknowledged.

41:53.478 --> 41:55.228
Here.

42:00.937 --> 42:02.230
Look at all of them.

42:03.313 --> 42:06.522
Not "them," "it."

42:06.854 --> 42:09.272
This is all one organism.

42:39.152 --> 42:43.028
The part that got on board,
why did it take our people?

42:43.319 --> 42:44.736
Hard to say.

42:44.945 --> 42:47.278
When it got separated from itself,

42:47.487 --> 42:49.320
perhaps it needed
a physical connection

42:49.528 --> 42:52.278
with any life form it could find.
