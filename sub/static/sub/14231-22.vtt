[laughs] Maybe your record
will be up there someday, guys.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.469
-Dude!
-Cool!

11:59.803 --> 12:00.887
Gawrsh!

12:00.970 --> 12:01.888
[Carter] You kidding?

12:01.971 --> 12:03.765
You guys are hot! Quite hot!

12:03.848 --> 12:05.934
Whew! I feel it!

12:07.686 --> 12:09.396
Fire!

12:10.563 --> 12:12.565
-Hi, I'm the man--
-Fire!

12:12.649 --> 12:14.609
Sound the alarm!

12:16.403 --> 12:18.405
Stop, drop and roll!

12:18.488 --> 12:20.156
[groaning]

12:20.240 --> 12:21.408
[both grunting]

12:24.577 --> 12:26.413
[sighs]

12:26.496 --> 12:29.249
[sobbing] My million dollar rug

12:29.332 --> 12:32.252
woven by little old ladies
in downtown Istanbul...

12:32.335 --> 12:33.920
It's ruined!

12:34.838 --> 12:36.673
[growling]

12:38.299 --> 12:41.594
[laughs] Ah, there's no reason
to get upset.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.888
I'll just add it to the amount
you already owe me.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.057
-[both] Owe you?
-Oh, yeah.

12:46.391 --> 12:48.101
There are already
video distribution costs,

12:48.184 --> 12:50.061
reserving concert halls,
touring costs, you know.

12:50.145 --> 12:51.730
[panting]

12:51.813 --> 12:53.314
Excuse me, my good man.

12:53.565 --> 12:54.899
Let's get the tour started, huh?

12:54.983 --> 12:56.317
Your first concert date is comin' up.

12:56.401 --> 12:57.736
But, Colonel Carter, I'm--

12:57.819 --> 12:59.988
I want this mess cleaned up
by the time I get back,

13:00.071 --> 13:01.823
or you're fired!

13:01.906 --> 13:03.074
[snoring]

13:03.158 --> 13:04.743
Oh, ladies and gentlemen,

13:04.826 --> 13:07.412
the Goof Troop has left the building.

13:07.495 --> 13:12.500
No ladies, I'm taken. [snore]
I'm, I'm already taken.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.252
Max! We're here. Come on!

13:14.586 --> 13:17.005
Oh! Hotels are great,

13:17.088 --> 13:20.842
the pool, the room service, the groupies.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.013
[both] The pits!

13:26.348 --> 13:28.850
-Uh, Max?
-Yeah?

13:28.933 --> 13:31.936
This rock 'n' roll stuff's
really great, huh?

13:32.604 --> 13:33.938
Yeah, great.

13:34.022 --> 13:37.609
Yeah, it'd be really great
if I had my own bed, though.

13:37.692 --> 13:41.154
Yeah. Or sheets.
Some sheets would be good.

13:41.363 --> 13:43.323
Otherwise, it's great.

13:43.698 --> 13:44.532
Great.

13:44.616 --> 13:47.369
[yawns] 'Nighty-night, Petey boy.

13:48.203 --> 13:49.829
Aw, shut up!

13:51.331 --> 13:52.791
[Goofy snoring]

13:53.333 --> 13:56.002
Hmm, a wise guy, eh?

13:59.464 --> 14:01.383
Ah, the stupid Goof.

14:01.466 --> 14:03.176
I'd flush him down the shower drain,

14:03.259 --> 14:05.679
but it'd scare the cockroaches!

14:05.762 --> 14:07.722
[rooster crows]

14:07.806 --> 14:09.557
Mornin'! Wake up, everybody.

14:09.641 --> 14:11.559
Sleep is for sissies. Come on, get up.

14:12.143 --> 14:16.314
Just five more minutes,
my little muffin tin!

14:16.398 --> 14:18.817
Oh, but it's so early.

14:19.317 --> 14:22.821
Burning the candle at both ends,
now that's rock 'n' roll.

14:23.321 --> 14:25.824
Colonel, why are we staying at a hotel

14:25.907 --> 14:28.076
when we're only four blocks from home?

14:28.159 --> 14:30.745
[stammers] I can't make any
money if you live at home!

14:30.829 --> 14:33.206
-Huh?
-[chuckles] You know, I mean,

14:33.289 --> 14:34.833
you can't be ready for the rigors
of the road

14:34.916 --> 14:36.167
unless you train for them!

14:36.251 --> 14:37.544
Hey, success hurts!

14:37.794 --> 14:39.713
Oh, yeah, sure.

14:39.796 --> 14:41.214
I'll need some cash for the room.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.925
Okay, okay, hold your horses.

14:45.802 --> 14:48.513
Wait a second! These are my pants.

14:50.682 --> 14:53.685
Okay if I borrow a couple of bucks, Goof?

14:53.768 --> 14:55.895
-[snores]
-Thanks.

14:55.979 --> 14:58.440
That oughta cover it.
If not, you can owe me.

14:58.690 --> 15:00.108
[Goofy snores]

15:00.191 --> 15:02.193
He says no problemo.

15:04.529 --> 15:07.115
Half a dozen eggs, over medium,
couple o' T-bone steaks,

15:07.198 --> 15:09.951
A mountain o' cottage fries,
coffee, orange juice,

15:10.035 --> 15:12.454
freshly squeezed, of course,
stack of flapjacks.

15:12.537 --> 15:14.873
Hey, ah, and give them
an English muffin to share.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.751
Gotta get in shape for the tour. Trust me.

15:17.834 --> 15:19.502
[gobbling]

15:20.837 --> 15:23.423
Colonel Carter, we wrote a great song.

15:23.506 --> 15:25.675
Oh yeah, it's about a vampire bat.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.635
[laughs] But listen, boys.

15:27.719 --> 15:29.929
My bands only play my material, my way.

15:30.013 --> 15:31.139
It makes the bookkeeping easier

15:31.222 --> 15:33.433
when it comes to distributing
the royalties, you know?

15:33.808 --> 15:37.395
All right. As long as we're
performing, I guess.

15:37.479 --> 15:39.397
Oh, you're gonna be performing
your ears off.

15:39.481 --> 15:41.066
[laughs]

15:41.941 --> 15:43.026
[chuckling sarcastically]

15:43.109 --> 15:45.487
[burps] Sorry, this must be yours.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.197
It's 35 bucks for the grub.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.823
Next comes creating
the rock 'n' roll image

15:48.907 --> 15:49.866
That'll make millions.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.993
Yeah, But we haven't even
finished breakfast.

15:52.077 --> 15:54.245
Too late now. Fame
and fortune are waiting.

15:56.706 --> 15:59.793
Well, what do you think?
Am I a genius or what?

15:59.876 --> 16:03.171
Now you are ready for your first gig!

16:05.382 --> 16:07.133
[tires squeal]

16:07.342 --> 16:08.301
Okay, boys!

16:08.385 --> 16:12.180
Next stop, Spoonerville Amphitheater.
Big time!

16:13.223 --> 16:15.225
[all coughing]

16:18.228 --> 16:21.147
Ya know, this isn't fun anymore.

16:21.231 --> 16:23.525
Yeah! We gotta dress like dweebs.

16:23.608 --> 16:25.694
Up in front of people we don't even know!

16:25.777 --> 16:27.862
and we don't even get to do our own songs!

16:27.946 --> 16:30.365
You left out one thing.

16:30.448 --> 16:31.366
[both] What?

16:31.449 --> 16:32.784
We owe big bucks!

16:32.867 --> 16:35.286
We have to do this concert to break even.

16:35.370 --> 16:36.705
Don't worry, fellers.

16:36.788 --> 16:39.708
Me and Betsy here are
behind ya all the way!

16:40.375 --> 16:42.168
That's swell, Pop.

16:42.669 --> 16:46.214
Rock 'n' roll forever!

16:46.381 --> 16:49.092
[all] Rock 'n' roll forever.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.178
We have to get out of this.

16:54.556 --> 16:57.684
[P.J.] Gosh, Max, I feel
like a cat in a dog pound.

16:58.351 --> 17:01.771
[Max] Relax, P.J... What can they
do if they don't like us?

17:01.855 --> 17:04.607
I don't know, man,
but there's enough of them to do it a lot!

17:04.691 --> 17:06.693
I just decided I don't
want to be a rock star.

17:06.776 --> 17:08.945
Me, too, but what about the concert?

17:09.029 --> 17:11.114
[crowd hooting]

17:11.197 --> 17:12.032
Come on!

17:13.116 --> 17:15.368
What can't be found can't perform!

17:15.452 --> 17:16.786
Max, wait.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.123
Hey, this is no exit.

17:20.206 --> 17:22.709
No, it's the inside of a locked trunk.

17:22.792 --> 17:25.003
Oh, pretty lame, Max. Even for you.

17:25.086 --> 17:27.589
Hey, what do you expect
from a terrified adolescent?

17:27.672 --> 17:29.507
[Carter] [chuckles] I guess my advertising

17:29.591 --> 17:32.093
for the best rock band in
history really worked, huh?

17:32.177 --> 17:33.678
The place is packed!

17:33.762 --> 17:36.306
The boys will put on
a nice little show for them.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.974
Hey, they'd better!

17:38.058 --> 17:40.894
Whoa! I'd hate to disappoint
that many people!

17:40.977 --> 17:43.646
Ten thousand seats in this dump,

17:43.730 --> 17:46.483
and we got 20 bucks for every one of them!

17:46.566 --> 17:49.402
Yeah! [chuckles] That should
just about make us even.

17:49.486 --> 17:50.612
[groans]

17:50.695 --> 17:52.572
[crowd] [chanting] Goof Troop! Goof Troop!

17:52.655 --> 17:54.824
Crowd's getting impatient.
Better start the show.

17:54.908 --> 17:56.826
Hmm. Wonder where the boys are.

17:56.910 --> 17:58.411
Makes no difference to me.

17:58.495 --> 18:00.580
They don't perform, I just
foreclose on your houses.

18:00.663 --> 18:01.664
[both] What?

18:02.165 --> 18:03.208
Just good business.

18:03.291 --> 18:04.959
Either way, I make out like a bandit.

18:05.210 --> 18:08.213
I'll twist your business off
and I'll stuff it--

18:08.296 --> 18:11.341
Oh, hold on. Not now, Pete.
We gotta find the boys.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.468
Don't want them to miss their big chance.

18:13.551 --> 18:15.303
I'll say we don't!

18:15.387 --> 18:16.680
[crowd] [chanting] Goof Troop! Goof Troop!

18:16.763 --> 18:18.056
You keep the crowd happy

18:18.139 --> 18:19.641
while I find the brats!

18:20.016 --> 18:22.519
Wait! What are ya doing? Stop pushing!

18:22.602 --> 18:24.646
[P.J.] Max! You know,
we gotta do this concert.

18:24.729 --> 18:25.939
Our dads need us!

18:26.022 --> 18:28.858
I know, I know, but how do
we get out of these things?

18:28.942 --> 18:31.695
I don't think we're supposed
to get in them in the first place.

18:31.778 --> 18:35.115
If you're not going to say
something helpful, P.J.,

18:35.198 --> 18:37.283
keep it buttoned!

18:38.535 --> 18:39.869
[applause]

18:39.953 --> 18:42.163
[man] Whoa, I know that dude.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.124
Hiya, folks.

18:44.207 --> 18:46.292
Well, uh, you hear the one

18:46.376 --> 18:48.962
about the Frenchman
who wouldn't eat snails?

18:49.045 --> 18:52.007
He preferred fast food. [laughing]

18:52.090 --> 18:54.509
That one really tickles me.

18:54.592 --> 18:56.052
[clears throat]

18:56.136 --> 18:58.179
Well, you'll love this one. Ah-hyuck!

18:58.263 --> 19:00.098
What's the difference between an elephant

19:00.181 --> 19:01.808
and my best friend Pete?

19:02.517 --> 19:05.186
About 10 pounds. Ah-hyuck!

19:08.982 --> 19:10.483
Don't you get it?

19:11.192 --> 19:13.653
Hey! What's the-- Whoa!

19:14.571 --> 19:15.697
Hey! Watch it!

19:15.780 --> 19:17.115
[shouting]

19:20.618 --> 19:22.412
Comedy's not their thing.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.164
Ya find the boys?

19:24.247 --> 19:25.832
-[P.J.] Help! Anybody!
-[Max] We're in here!

19:25.915 --> 19:27.876
-Let me out of here. Come on.
-Let us out!

19:28.293 --> 19:30.462
Now, that's what I call a costume.

19:30.545 --> 19:32.380
[Max] We're locked in!

19:33.548 --> 19:34.966
[Goofy] Hey! Take it easy!

19:35.050 --> 19:37.594
[Pete] Keep them entertained
while I get the boys out!

19:37.969 --> 19:40.513
Ah-hyuck! I'm back!

19:40.597 --> 19:43.475
Ah-hyuck! You care to see some dancing?

19:43.558 --> 19:44.642
Ah-hyuck!

19:44.726 --> 19:47.604
[vocalizes]

19:48.021 --> 19:49.272
Not bad, huh?

19:50.523 --> 19:54.277
Whoa! Ah-hyuck! You missed me!

19:54.361 --> 19:57.697
Ohh! Stop! No fair! Whoa!

19:58.782 --> 20:00.617
-[thuds]
-[grunts]

20:00.700 --> 20:02.035
[groaning]

20:03.828 --> 20:04.704
Now?

20:04.788 --> 20:07.415
Not yet. Go on back out there!

20:07.707 --> 20:08.541
Shucks!

20:13.004 --> 20:14.923
[gulping noisily]

20:15.006 --> 20:16.925
[gagging]

20:21.262 --> 20:23.848
Whoa! [straining]

20:29.062 --> 20:30.063
Whoa!

20:30.647 --> 20:31.731
[screams]

20:31.815 --> 20:33.983
[crowd laughs]

20:35.151 --> 20:36.152
[shouts]

20:37.070 --> 20:40.240
Ladies and gents, the Goof Troop.

20:40.323 --> 20:42.992
[cheering, applause]

20:47.163 --> 20:48.581
[gulps]

20:48.790 --> 20:51.543
[crowd boos]

20:51.626 --> 20:52.961
Go for it, Maxie.

20:56.131 --> 20:58.550
Forget to plug him in. Ah-hyuck!

20:58.800 --> 20:59.884
Hit it, Maxie!

21:02.595 --> 21:05.265
[hysterical cheers]

21:07.392 --> 21:10.770
You boys were phenomenal!
A hit! I'll-- [chuckles]

21:10.854 --> 21:13.440
I mean-- [chuckles] We'll make millions!

21:13.523 --> 21:15.442
Not with the Goof Troop you won't.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.402
Yeah, we're retiring.

21:17.485 --> 21:19.571
But you can't! I discovered you!

21:19.654 --> 21:21.197
You owe me for all I've done for you!

21:22.532 --> 21:25.952
All we owe you is a trip
to intensive care!

21:26.036 --> 21:27.120
No, Dad! Wait!

21:27.370 --> 21:29.205
Yeah, Mr. P, we're already hitting him

21:29.289 --> 21:31.458
where it hurts the most-- His wallet!

21:31.541 --> 21:33.918
Well, you're right,

21:34.002 --> 21:36.921
but I wish he was wearing
his wallet on his face!

21:37.005 --> 21:39.674
[sighs] Well, they all can't
be as dumb as they look.

21:41.134 --> 21:43.511
[chuckles] Boy, I'm glad that's over.

21:43.595 --> 21:46.890
Yeah. The closest I ever want
to be to a concert again

21:46.973 --> 21:47.974
is in the audience.

21:48.058 --> 21:49.976
Oh, I don't know.

21:50.060 --> 21:52.937
I kinda liked it up there
on stage in the spotlight.

21:53.021 --> 21:55.815
Hey! What do ya think of me going solo?

21:55.899 --> 21:58.318
In some of them tight sequined pants,

21:58.401 --> 22:00.195
with electric rhinestonees

22:00.278 --> 22:01.905
and a strobe string tie.

22:01.988 --> 22:04.324
Wait! What're you doing?

22:04.407 --> 22:06.242
Aren't we gonna talk to the Colonel?

22:06.326 --> 22:07.452
Maxie! Pete!
