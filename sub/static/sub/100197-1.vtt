INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER

01:08.944 --> 01:12.436
LARRY MERCHANT:
When the bell rang in a Roberto Durén fight

01:12.489 --> 01:15.822
you felt something's going to happen.

01:16.868 --> 01:21.953
To be able to be in the ring
119 times over 40 years

01:22.583 --> 01:24.369
it's unparalleled. He did it.

01:25.586 --> 01:31.126
He was absolutely ferocious, he was fearless.
The greatest lightweight in boxing history.

01:33.093 --> 01:37.837
He always pressed the action.
He always brought that charisma, that anger.

01:39.224 --> 01:41.215
ROBERT DE NIRO:
Roberto was a great fighter

01:41.268 --> 01:44.886
and he's an interesting character.
Flamboyant, flashy.

01:45.856 --> 01:51.647
It's frightening to see his upbringings
and how he has survived that.

01:53.322 --> 01:56.109
A young man from Panama
who brought the people together.

01:56.158 --> 02:00.367
He was a catalyst for hope, aspiration.
He kept it all alive.

CROWD CHEERS

02:04.291 --> 02:07.033
ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH:

02:08.669 --> 02:12.128
REPORTER: The continents of North America
and South America are connected

02:12.174 --> 02:15.337
by a narrow link of land, Central America.

02:15.844 --> 02:19.211
As explorers and traders learnt more
about Central America

02:19.264 --> 02:22.256
they found that the shortest path
from ocean to ocean

02:22.517 --> 02:26.760
was across the area known today
as the Republic of Panama.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.183
SPORTSCASTER:
There ’s the ﬁery Panamanian Dura’n

02:29.232 --> 02:30.563
right on Buchanan again.

02:32.069 --> 02:35.027
REPORTER: The United States
built a great Panama Canal

02:35.072 --> 02:39.611
controlling the trade routes
from north to south and east to west.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.829
We should and those negotiations
and tell the General:

02:46.708 --> 02:49.450
”We bought it, we paid for it, we built it

02:50.003 --> 02:51.209
and we intend to keep it”.

02:53.215 --> 02:55.206
REPORTER:
Shipping through the Panama Canal

02:55.258 --> 02:57.499
and the nearly 10,000 American troops
guarding it

02:57.678 --> 02:59.259
were not affected by the unrest.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.420
REPORTER 2: The canal would be
a prime target for an aggressor

03:01.473 --> 03:03.509
seeking to disrupt peace and security.

03:03.558 --> 03:06.925
REPORTER 3: The US Senate declared it would
always respect Panamanian sovereignty.

03:06.978 --> 03:08.218
REPORTER 4:
Preparing for the crackdown

03:08.271 --> 03:11.229
the government had ordered the closure
of banks, schools and government offices.

03:11.274 --> 03:13.560
THEY CHANT:
USA!

03:14.111 --> 03:16.648
SPORTSCASTER:
A tremendous right hand by Duran.

INDISTINCT CHATTER

03:18.949 --> 03:21.941
SPORTSCASTER:
Dura’n just cannot be beaten or intimidated.

03:24.121 --> 03:27.579
Last night, / ordered
US military forces to Panama.

03:33.422 --> 03:37.256
GEORGE BUSH: And we will not be
intimated by the bullying tactics

03:37.884 --> 03:41.843
brutal though they may be,
of the dictator, Noriega.

04:06.121 --> 04:10.330
ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH:

04:43.158 --> 04:47.822
LARRY MERCHANT:
He found an order in a disorderly universe

04:47.871 --> 04:52.535
when he was a child,
in learning how to fight.

04:52.918 --> 04:55.580
Not just to fight, but howto fight.

04:57.172 --> 04:59.413
SPRINGS TOLEDO:
Duran was a product of want.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.878
Duran was a product of poverty.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.084
You have a natural fighter here.

05:04.137 --> 05:09.097
You have someone who's driven
by vivid memories of going to bed hungry

05:09.142 --> 05:13.556
and dirt floors
and barrels lit on fire for heat.

05:14.981 --> 05:17.643
ROBIN DURAN:
He didn't have a family, a proper family.

05:18.318 --> 05:23.278
He was abandoned by his father
and he had to rough it out on the streets.

05:23.323 --> 05:27.032
He had to make a living since very young,
selling newspapers, shining shoes

05:27.077 --> 05:30.740
on the streets and trying to support
his family while being a five—year—old kid.

05:31.456 --> 05:32.946
So, it was hard for him.

05:36.795 --> 05:39.958
IN SPANISH:

05:59.693 --> 06:02.776
Well, the Canal Zone
is not a colonial possession.

06:02.821 --> 06:07.110
It is not a long—term lease.
It is sovereign United States territory.

06:14.624 --> 06:16.160
Where do prize fighters come?

06:16.209 --> 06:20.122
They come from desperate, poor circumstance.

06:20.171 --> 06:22.002
In the sport of boxing

06:22.757 --> 06:27.547
it requires such emotional strength,
determination

06:27.596 --> 06:31.760
the experience of being
in very difficult situations daily.

06:33.935 --> 06:36.142
Pain, living with pain every day.

06:36.688 --> 06:39.145
It's not a stretch to walk into a boxing gym.

SPORTSCASTER: Dynamite in both hands
and he ’3 showing it tonight.

06:45.113 --> 06:48.025
LARRY MERCHANT:
There has to be some inner fire

06:48.074 --> 06:52.067
that wants to escape from where he came
and from what he'd seen

06:52.871 --> 06:57.114
and some desire just to...

06:58.376 --> 06:59.957
beat other people up.

07:01.463 --> 07:06.127
ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH:

07:12.557 --> 07:15.890
JUAN CARLOS TAPIA IN SPANISH:

07:41.169 --> 07:43.410
ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH:

07:50.887 --> 07:53.128
Ray Arcel had 20 world champions.

07:53.181 --> 07:58.141
Now, keep in mind this is not 20 belt holders
or a few world champions and belt holders.

07:58.186 --> 08:01.394
These are legitimate true champions,
divisional kings

08:01.564 --> 08:03.475
and Ray Arcel had 20 of them.

08:03.525 --> 08:08.019
He wasn't the typical trainer
that you would think of.

08:08.071 --> 08:11.234
He was more like, as somebody described him,
"He dressed like a banker."

08:11.282 --> 08:12.738
He was very much a gentleman.

08:12.784 --> 08:16.527
He was very elegant
and he cared for his fighters very much.

08:17.163 --> 08:19.654
/ always felt that there was no one
could beat him.

08:19.708 --> 08:21.039
/ told him one time, / said:

08:21.084 --> 08:24.872
”/f you fought the heavyweight champion
of the world, you could win. ”

08:24.921 --> 08:27.207
ROBERT DE NIRO:
Roberto was his last fighter

08:27.257 --> 08:31.591
and he was, at that time, close to 80
and he was not wanting to go back into it.

08:31.636 --> 08:34.048
He did because Roberto was so special.

08:34.097 --> 08:39.011
This kind of like a father—son relationship
which I think that they had.

08:40.145 --> 08:42.977
Every trainer has a different work ethic.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.856
Every trainer has
a different way of instilling

08:45.900 --> 08:48.141
in their fighter a fighting style.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.769
Ray Arcel called him a natural fighter.

08:50.822 --> 08:53.985
In other words,
they clearly didn't have to teach him much.

08:56.077 --> 09:01.367
ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH:

09:08.757 --> 09:11.965
MARVIN HAGLER: All these guys learn a lot
of stuff from the streets and whatever

09:12.010 --> 09:13.750
and they bring it into the ring.

09:14.304 --> 09:17.171
Being a champion is something that
you gotta learn and you gotta learn it

09:17.223 --> 09:18.258
the hard way.

09:18.308 --> 09:21.220
And the most of us,
we had nothing to start out with.

09:21.269 --> 09:24.807
So, we ain't got nothing to lose.
HE CHUCKLES

09:25.148 --> 09:27.730
SPORTSCASTER: He ’3 gone!
There is no getting up from that.

09:32.197 --> 09:35.280
ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH:

09:58.056 --> 09:59.762
APPLAUSE

10:00.475 --> 10:02.011
SPRINGS TOLEDO:
Ken Buchanan was the favourite.

10:02.060 --> 10:04.426
He was very good, if not a great fighter.

10:04.979 --> 10:08.142
Well, I was a boxer
and Roberto was a fighter.

10:08.191 --> 10:09.522
I knew what I was up against, like.

10:09.609 --> 10:12.942
Roberto, you seem very confident
that this is going to be a knockout.

10:12.987 --> 10:15.524
Now, let’s go a step further
and tell me the round.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.773
IN SPANISH:

10:24.249 --> 10:29.744
LARRY MERCHANT: Duran had
this absolute certainty that he would win.

10:29.796 --> 10:33.914
I remember thinking:
"What does he know that we don't know?"

10:34.634 --> 10:36.170
STEVE LOTT:
When the bell rang for round one

10:36.219 --> 10:38.426
it was like Duran's coming out
to end the fight

10:38.471 --> 10:40.587
like you just stole something from him.

10:40.640 --> 10:44.007
He fought Ken Buchanan
as if Ken Buchanan mugged his mother.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.596
SPORTSCASTER:
Oh, he really hurt him that time!

10:46.646 --> 10:49.558
He just had the guts to keep going

10:49.607 --> 10:52.189
throwing punches at me
and hoping they were going to land.

10:52.235 --> 10:54.851
He had just turned 21 years old
ten days earlier.

10:54.904 --> 10:57.896
He combined his aggression
with being elusive.

10:57.949 --> 11:02.283
And for Buchanan,
to withstand that for round after round

11:02.328 --> 11:03.568
it was a tremendous effort.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.528
Duran was fighting for a nation.

11:07.250 --> 11:10.492
REPORTER: The trouble began when a group
of American high school pupils

11:10.545 --> 11:14.129
flew an American flag
without the Panamanian flag by its side.

11:14.299 --> 11:19.544
ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH:

11:25.977 --> 11:28.184
REPORTER:
And before the Panamanian National Guard

11:28.229 --> 11:31.471
the police and US troops
brought the rioters under control

11:32.150 --> 11:35.642
more than a score were dead,
including four US soldiers.

11:40.033 --> 11:43.321
ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH:

11:47.373 --> 11:50.240
GUILLERMO COCHEZ:
The Panamanians cannot talk politics.

11:50.293 --> 11:53.785
Cannot talk in the papers,
because we don't have freedom of speech.

11:54.964 --> 11:58.377
Duran came as a symbol of opportunity

11:58.551 --> 12:01.714
to express ourselves
as a country of oppression.

12:01.763 --> 12:04.470
SPORTSCASTER: / don ’t think Buchanan
has ever been in this much trouble.

12:04.515 --> 12:06.801
Duran knew how to pace himself naturally.

12:06.851 --> 12:09.684
He also had a lot of stamina,
he kept on going.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.811
He was just relentless

12:11.856 --> 12:15.895
going after him with his head
as well as his fists

12:15.944 --> 12:18.151
and eventually, he just broke him down.

12:18.196 --> 12:20.107
BELL RINGS

12:20.990 --> 12:23.026
KEN BUCHANAN:
He hit me low and that was it.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.488
Like, the referee...
He just stopped the fight.

12:25.536 --> 12:29.154
SPORTSCASTER: And the winner
and new lightweight champion of the world

12:29.707 --> 12:33.666
21—year—old Roberto Duran of Panama.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.874
SPRINGS TOLEDO: That moment announced
Duran on the world stage without a doubt.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.885
A fighter arises from their midst

12:43.930 --> 12:45.841
who became one of the all—time greats.

12:45.890 --> 12:48.302
Something personal driving him.

12:48.351 --> 12:53.687
I'm not sure if Duran even understood what it
was but there was something that was primal.

12:59.862 --> 13:03.571

13:42.697 --> 13:45.655
SPORTCASTER CHATTERS IN SPANISH

13:49.245 --> 13:52.783
He was naturally aggressive,
but he could also box.

13:53.458 --> 13:56.495
MIKE TYSON:
Ferocity and savage punching, speed...

13:56.544 --> 13:59.456
People never know him as fast,
but he's very fast.

13:59.505 --> 14:03.498
He has a great anticipation of punching.
He's just an all—around marvel in the ring.

14:03.885 --> 14:07.093
"Manos de Piedra" as a tag
is so perfect for him

14:07.138 --> 14:11.222
because it feels like...
His hands feel like freaking bricks.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.847
I've talked to fighters that have fought him

14:14.896 --> 14:17.057
and everyone underestimates him.

14:17.106 --> 14:20.598
They think they can win
until they're in the ring with him.

14:21.110 --> 14:25.570
IN SPANISH:

14:50.264 --> 14:52.801
HE CHUCKLES
I actually have been in the ring

14:52.850 --> 14:56.308
in a fashion, with Roberto.

14:56.354 --> 15:00.063
He was in Rocky ll.
He's supposedly Rocky's sparring partner.

15:01.109 --> 15:06.900
ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH:

15:11.828 --> 15:15.366
At first, I thought,
this will be pretty interesting

15:15.415 --> 15:19.909
because, you know,
I was a few pounds heavier, a little taller

15:19.961 --> 15:26.082
and then I realised the difference
between amateur and consummate pro.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.339
The way he could move
his head just an inch...

15:30.388 --> 15:33.175
It's impossible to hit him.

15:34.559 --> 15:37.676
This man would demolish me in...

15:38.479 --> 15:42.563
Put it this way: if it was a fight, the fight
would be 11 seconds including the count.

15:43.276 --> 15:46.268
SPORTSCASTER SPEAKS SPANISH

15:46.320 --> 15:48.652
JOHN DINGES:
Every county is more than just its politics.

15:48.698 --> 15:54.034
Cultural heroes are particularly important
in times of political unrest.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.243
CROWD ROARS

15:57.248 --> 16:01.787
The Panamanian people always
identified themselves with Duran

16:01.836 --> 16:05.124
especially during his fights.
I mean, you know, it was a national fever.

16:05.673 --> 16:06.913
He won, we won.

16:08.176 --> 16:12.670
ROBERTO DIAZ HERRERA IN SPANISH:

IN SPANISH:

16:36.913 --> 16:41.327
REPORTER: The demonstration was organised by
Panama ’3 strongman, General Omar Torrijos.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.792
DON KING: He was remarkable.
He was strong, he was firm

16:47.548 --> 16:51.837
to promote the upward mobility
of the Panamanian people.

16:52.386 --> 16:56.129
REPORTER: The presence of 50,000 Americans
here at the Canal Zone

16:56.182 --> 16:59.470
have always been emotional issues
in Panama

16:59.519 --> 17:03.353
and Torrijos has demanded
Panamanian sovereignty over the zone.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.851
JOHN DINGES:
You could call him a military strongman

17:06.901 --> 17:10.064
but that doesn't really capture who he was.
He was a populist.

17:10.112 --> 17:13.354
He was somebody who identified down,
identified with the people.

17:14.909 --> 17:18.527
WOMAN: They have the weapons
and the tanks given by the United States

17:18.579 --> 17:20.911
but we have our dignity
and we are going to fight.

17:20.957 --> 17:22.117
We don ’t care if we die.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.540
JUAN CARLOS TAPIA IN SPANISH:

17:32.385 --> 17:35.502
REPORTER: In Washington on September 7th,
President Carter

17:35.555 --> 17:38.843
and the Panamanian president,
General Omar Torrijos

17:38.891 --> 17:43.385
signed two treaties for Washington
to surrender the Canal and Zone

17:43.437 --> 17:46.474
gradually to Panama by the year 2000.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.932
JUAN CARLOS TAPIA IN SPANISH:

18:06.836 --> 18:11.170
And what is to say that once we have declared
we are willing to give up that canal

18:11.257 --> 18:14.090
that he can ’t just cancel out
the rest of the treaty?

18:15.428 --> 18:19.797
IN SPANISH:

18:29.775 --> 18:35.771
JUAN CARLOS TAPIA IN SPANISH:

19:01.682 --> 19:06.722
LARRY MERCHANT:
Nobody cared in those days about "unbeaten".

19:07.480 --> 19:13.066
What they cared about is what Duran did,
which is you fight the best guys out there.

19:13.611 --> 19:17.945
You take your chances, you take risks.

19:18.199 --> 19:21.111
What really shows you
what he has going on inside

19:21.160 --> 19:24.994
is that his greatest fights
were still yet to come.

19:29.794 --> 19:31.910
At the end of the day,
the talent makes the fights

19:31.962 --> 19:36.171
but you've got to have the promoters
in order to plug them, to sell them

19:36.217 --> 19:38.424
to get the tickets out,
to get the crowd interested.

19:38.469 --> 19:40.460
You know, to get everybody's juices flowing.

19:42.223 --> 19:44.839
LENNOX LEWIS: You know,
the rise of the promoters was very important

19:44.892 --> 19:48.259
because they really brought out boxing.

19:48.437 --> 19:51.304
The promoters are the ones
that make that happen

19:51.357 --> 19:56.351
and if it wasn't for them making it happen,
we wouldn't be able to watch great events.

19:57.530 --> 20:00.237
Definitely worth $20 to see it.
I’ll be there.

20:00.449 --> 20:02.735
REPORTER:
Why is it worth that much to see this fight?

20:02.785 --> 20:04.776
Hey, that’s once in a century.

20:05.496 --> 20:07.908
That’s gonna be the best fight
/ ever seen in my life.

20:07.957 --> 20:09.788
There's been a little bit more
of a razzmatazz

20:09.834 --> 20:11.870
come to the boxing game over the years,
you know?

20:11.919 --> 20:16.003
And it has made non—boxing people
boxing fans, you know what I mean?

20:16.048 --> 20:17.663
So they have served their point

20:17.717 --> 20:19.673
and none more so
than Don King and Bob Arum.

20:19.885 --> 20:22.126
...that you will see on Monday night

20:22.179 --> 20:24.636
will be one of the greatest ﬁghts
in history.

20:24.807 --> 20:26.968
LENNOX LEWIS:
Arum and King, they were like...

20:27.893 --> 20:32.978
apples and oranges, you know?
Same bag of groceries, but different fruits.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.516
DON KING:
I was a great promoter, you know?

20:36.569 --> 20:39.026
And I say that immodestly,
but I'm just a fact.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.437
You know, not braggadocio,
just a fact of what it is.

20:41.782 --> 20:43.613
ROBIN DURAN:
They were probably the pioneers

20:43.659 --> 20:46.366
and they were the ones who planted the seed

20:46.412 --> 20:48.494
for boxing to be what it is today.

20:48.539 --> 20:49.619
They were rivals.

20:49.707 --> 20:53.416
Every time they would find a great fight,
they would make it happen.

20:53.461 --> 20:59.422
My relationship with King,
throughout that period, was very adversarial.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.799
I think it benefitted both of us.

21:01.844 --> 21:03.880
He played off me, I played off him.

21:03.929 --> 21:08.047
I would have never known how good I was
if I didn't have lonesome Bob.

21:08.267 --> 21:11.225
Can't tell him what to do neither.
When he gets passionate

21:11.270 --> 21:14.012
and he gets on a tyrant or a rage

21:14.064 --> 21:17.977
he just goes, man.
You know what? It's no holds barred.

21:18.235 --> 21:21.693
You got to be on your P's and Q's
when you're dealing with Bob Arum.

21:21.739 --> 21:26.073
He was a treacherous foe, you know,
and an admirable friend.

21:30.873 --> 21:34.411
Tremendously adept at promoting himself.

21:34.460 --> 21:40.706
A lot of promotional activities were centred
on Don King as the promoter.

21:42.843 --> 21:47.177
DON KING: He got his idiosyncrasies
and I have mine, you know what I mean?

21:47.223 --> 21:51.136
So, you know, sometimes we can make
the twain meet, you know what I mean?

21:51.185 --> 21:53.346
So we could be
friends today and foes tomorrow.

21:54.855 --> 21:56.971
MAURICIO SULAIMAN:
The rivalry between them

21:57.024 --> 22:00.107
was as important as the one
from the fighters.

22:00.653 --> 22:04.817
So, people knew
when there was a fight involving both

22:04.865 --> 22:06.856
it would be a tremendous event.

22:06.909 --> 22:10.493
Duran is cal/ed,
/ mean, if we read the sports pages here

22:10.538 --> 22:13.405
one of the toughest punchers for his weight.

22:13.457 --> 22:15.823
He ’3 certain/y maybe the toughest puncher
you’ve ever faced.

22:15.876 --> 22:17.116
He ’3 a bra w/er, street—fighter.

22:17.169 --> 22:20.457
Somebody said it’s like being hit by a rock
to be hit by this guy.

22:20.506 --> 22:21.541
Scared?

22:22.049 --> 22:23.585
Just a little.
HE CHUCKLES

22:23.634 --> 22:26.000
BOB ARUM:
Ray was America's sweetheart.

22:26.053 --> 22:32.049
He had won the Olympic gold medal
in Montreal in 1976.

22:32.601 --> 22:35.843
And Ray had a great smile
and a great personality.

22:35.896 --> 22:38.308
So, he was America's darling.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.939
An absolute master boxer at welterweight,
you know?

22:40.985 --> 22:43.146
The golden boy, if you like.

22:44.029 --> 22:47.396
LARRY MERCHANT:
A celebrated young fighter in America.

22:47.449 --> 22:49.940
Brilliant Ali—like smile

22:49.994 --> 22:52.906
but there were still
some questions out there.

22:52.955 --> 22:56.288
Could he stand in with a really tough guy?

22:57.167 --> 23:00.330
Sugar Ray Leonard, for his first fight,
he earned $40,000.

23:01.046 --> 23:02.911
Roberto Duran was 16 years old.

23:02.965 --> 23:04.921
He probably earned a couple of mangoes.

23:04.967 --> 23:07.208
So Duran looked upon Leonard

23:07.261 --> 23:10.799
and felt something like rage
about what Leonard had.

23:10.848 --> 23:14.887
SYLVESTER STALLONE:
An Olympian who was America's sweetheart

23:14.935 --> 23:17.768
against...
HE SIGHS

23:18.147 --> 23:19.387
a... a...

23:20.858 --> 23:22.018
a demon.

23:22.067 --> 23:25.980
A destruction machine.
It just made for great theatre.

23:27.072 --> 23:31.816
Especially in America, since the beginning
of time, you could always pitch good vs evil.

23:32.119 --> 23:35.452
People were just beginning to adjust

23:35.497 --> 23:39.115
to the presence of Hispanics
in the United States.

23:39.168 --> 23:43.127
There was a lot of anti—Hispanic feeling.

23:43.172 --> 23:47.962
Duran instinctively played
his role as that villain.

23:48.010 --> 23:50.752
During the press conference
to announce the fight

23:52.681 --> 23:56.594
the guy walked into that room.

23:57.478 --> 24:01.221
His eyes, his expressions...

24:01.982 --> 24:07.147
His demeanour was so...
just violent and just nasty.

24:07.279 --> 24:10.863
HE SPEAKS SPANISH

24:10.908 --> 24:13.445
”/’m not here to be a clown
like this guy over here. ”

24:13.494 --> 24:14.574
CROWD LAUGHS

24:14.620 --> 24:17.783
ROBERTO DURAN SPEAKS SPANISH

24:17.831 --> 24:19.867
"This is the first time in his life

24:19.917 --> 24:22.499
he ’s gonna have
to get in the ring and fight. ”

24:22.920 --> 24:26.003
Today / said a few words.
/ looked at him and he was ready to fight.

24:26.048 --> 24:28.460
He took his rings off and everything.
/ think he was ready.

24:30.469 --> 24:34.178
ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH:

24:49.154 --> 24:54.615
When Ray's wife Juanita would go out
of the hotel to go shopping

24:55.786 --> 24:59.244
Duran would come down and follow in a car

24:59.289 --> 25:01.746
and say the vilest things.

25:01.792 --> 25:03.657
SUGAR RAY LEONARD:
It bothered me as a man.

25:04.253 --> 25:07.245
lt bothered me as a guy.
It bothered me as a fighter.

25:08.132 --> 25:12.751
And you don't insult a man's wife, girl...

25:12.803 --> 25:16.887
You don't do that,
and l was gonna get him back.

25:17.433 --> 25:19.048
l was gonna get him back.

25:19.101 --> 25:22.343
With Roberto, it was an act.
It really was an act.

25:24.356 --> 25:27.894
ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH:

25:34.199 --> 25:37.612
It meant for tremendous closed—circuit sales.

25:37.661 --> 25:39.902
It was a blockbuster

25:40.456 --> 25:45.041
because he played his role
of the villain to perfection.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.751
CROWD CHEERS

25:51.675 --> 25:53.836
SPORTSCASTER:
Live from Montreal, Canada.

25:53.886 --> 25:58.050
It's the WBC
World ’3 Welterweight Championship.

25:58.098 --> 26:01.135
Sugar Pa y Leonard vs Roberto Dura’n.

26:01.185 --> 26:05.349
We are in on one of the historic events
in all of history.

26:06.190 --> 26:10.684
More people tonight will see this telecast

26:10.736 --> 26:14.524
than have ever witnessed
a cable telecast before, closed—circuit.

26:15.282 --> 26:18.524
Throughout my career,
I never walked to the ring angry.

26:18.577 --> 26:19.566
Except that fight.

26:20.162 --> 26:22.403
And I remember vividly

26:22.456 --> 26:25.118
in Montreal, walking to that ring, I mean...

26:26.376 --> 26:30.039
My mind was thinking toe—to—toe,
toe—to—toe with this guy.

26:30.297 --> 26:32.162
CROWD CHEERS

26:33.342 --> 26:36.709
Leonard, prior to the fight, said to himself:
"I wanna knock this guy out."

26:38.889 --> 26:43.929
Leonard wanted to stand toe—to—toe with one
of the most vicious fighters of all time.

26:43.977 --> 26:46.684
I thank him for that,
because it made it a great fight.

26:48.023 --> 26:50.765
SUGAR RAY LEONARD:
I remember the bell going. Bing, first round.

26:51.735 --> 26:53.225
I didn't foresee any problem...

26:54.238 --> 26:55.523
until he hit me.

26:55.572 --> 26:56.982
INDISTINCT COMMENTARY

26:57.032 --> 26:59.398
I've never been hit that hard.

26:59.451 --> 27:04.616
Duran was perpetual motion.
He was tenacious, aggressive and...

27:06.208 --> 27:08.119
IN SPANISH:

27:27.271 --> 27:29.057
SPRINGS TOLEDO:
Duran had a lot of old school tricks.

27:29.106 --> 27:31.097
There's something called
the "Fitzsimmons shift".

27:31.150 --> 27:32.936
He would throw a dummy right hand

27:32.985 --> 27:35.101
and immediately go into a southpaw position

27:35.154 --> 27:39.488
and then he would drive in a left hook
or a left uppercut to the solar plexus.

27:39.533 --> 27:42.570
That is high—tech, sophisticated strategy.

27:43.954 --> 27:45.694
ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH:

27:59.803 --> 28:01.043
SPORTSCASTER:
He ’3 playing games with him.

28:01.096 --> 28:04.338
Leonard is... Oh, man,
he's throwing these hydrogen bombs

28:04.391 --> 28:07.053
and he's throwing 'em
at 30 punches per second

28:10.522 --> 28:12.308
and, boom, it's like he's dancing.

28:12.357 --> 28:15.941
It's like it's ballet and I'm saying:
"Woah, he's making punches miss."

28:15.986 --> 28:19.194
I'm just... "Man! God! Damn!"

28:19.781 --> 28:21.737
They weren't far from each other.

28:21.783 --> 28:24.195
They're real close
and the movements were... "Oh!"

28:24.244 --> 28:26.656
Man, you couldn't believe
how close they were throwing punches.

28:27.206 --> 28:29.413
SPORTSCASTER:
Right above is Roberto Dura’n.

28:29.458 --> 28:32.450
And after seeing that fight,
I knew this was what I wanted to do.

28:33.670 --> 28:35.956
ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH:

28:38.008 --> 28:40.215
SPORTSCASTER:
Remember Leonard has never lost a fight.

28:40.761 --> 28:43.719
ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH:

28:45.015 --> 28:48.678
SPORTSCASTER: Duran thinks
he has won the fight. / can ’t believe it.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.968
BELL RINGS

28:51.021 --> 28:52.727

28:52.773 --> 28:54.479
SPORTSCASTER:
He thinks he ’3 won this fight

28:54.524 --> 28:56.389
and then he has to fight the 15th round./

28:56.443 --> 28:59.105
SPORTSCASTER 2:
/ think he thought so. He thinks he ’3 won.

28:59.154 --> 29:00.644
/ think he thought he won.

29:01.657 --> 29:06.367
I think you can be fairly certain that Duran,
at that point in his career

29:06.411 --> 29:08.151
was not hiding his feelings.

29:08.205 --> 29:10.992
SPORTSCASTER:
Now he ’s yelling at Benitez.

29:11.041 --> 29:14.499
Most fighters'd just take the win.
"Thank you very much" and get out.

29:14.544 --> 29:17.206
He was like: "No, have it.
That's what it's all about."

29:18.006 --> 29:19.086
That's why I loved him.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.627
He was X—rated for television at the time.

29:21.677 --> 29:25.135
At the time, he was giving people the finger,
grabbing his crotch

29:25.180 --> 29:27.637
and I thought that was incredible.

29:30.269 --> 29:32.134
SUGAR RAY LEONARD:
I said: "I don't need this anymore."

29:32.187 --> 29:34.018
I really contemplated retirement.

29:34.064 --> 29:39.184
I said: "I can't take this."
You know, "I can't take this, man."

29:39.736 --> 29:43.775
Duran had given him a beating
like he had never received in his life

29:43.824 --> 29:50.161
and he told me: "Sly, that night, I could
move every one of my teeth back and forth

29:50.205 --> 29:52.742
as if they literally were hanging in my gums.

29:52.791 --> 29:55.077
I thought all my teeth
were going to come out."

29:55.127 --> 29:57.584
That's how hard he hit.

29:57.963 --> 30:01.421
Yeah. I told Sly,
I told a lot of people that...

30:01.550 --> 30:05.384
Most people don't... were not privy to this,
the fact that he hit me like that.

30:05.429 --> 30:10.423
My forward teeth went back
and I went back to the corner

30:10.475 --> 30:14.138
and I asked my cornerman.
I said: "Guys, are my teeth knocked back?"

30:14.187 --> 30:16.348
And they said: "No, Ray, you're fine,
you're fine."

30:16.732 --> 30:19.269
Cos they didn't want to, you know, upset me.

30:19.609 --> 30:22.476
HE SCOFFS
But... I do remember that.

30:26.241 --> 30:28.983
SPRINGS TOLEDO: In my opinion,
Sugar Ray Leonard proved his greatness

30:29.036 --> 30:30.071
losing to Duran.

30:30.746 --> 30:33.203
Roberto Duran, on the other hand,
is a different beast.

30:33.248 --> 30:36.581
It's almost like he moved to Sodom
and Gomorrah. He just indulged.

Duran was a fighter of the people.

31:32.140 --> 31:34.096
He related and identified with them

DON KING:
It was ecstasy.

32:13.974 --> 32:18.092
It was a celebration of all the people.

32:18.145 --> 32:22.855
You know, because the celebration...
it was en masse, it was grandiose.

32:22.899 --> 32:24.480
Everybody was there.

32:24.526 --> 32:27.734
Babies, their mothers, their grandfathers.

32:27.779 --> 32:32.648
Everybody was there because it was
a family reunion, as they would say.

32:32.701 --> 32:35.784
The prodigal son is returning home,
so to speak.

32:36.997 --> 32:39.409
SPRINGS TOLEDO:
A month—long party is what it was.

32:39.458 --> 32:43.326
Now, you can understand
that Duran denies himself when he trains.

32:43.378 --> 32:46.415
So, in other words, he's reliving
his childhood when he trains.

32:46.465 --> 32:49.081
That's a little bit of a trauma for him,
it's a mini—trauma if you will.

32:49.634 --> 32:53.673
So after he wins,
sometimes after he lost, he would indulge.

32:53.722 --> 32:55.303
He would enjoy the fruits of his labour.

32:55.348 --> 32:58.306
Duran being Duran,
he did it a little too much

32:58.351 --> 33:00.307
but that's how he was wired.

In the difficult years,
they had Roberto Duran

33:12.824 --> 33:15.361
to represent them,
and save them and give them pride.

33:15.827 --> 33:20.537
So he was, and still is,
the most famous Panamanian today.

33:21.249 --> 33:25.037
He can do whatever he wants in Panama.
He can get away with anything.

he was gonna pick me up

with his brother at the airport.
I expected him to be kerbside

33:56.284 --> 33:58.946
but he wasn't. He was right through
at the gate when I got off the plane.

33:58.995 --> 34:02.738
He went: "Ricky, Ricky!"
and he took me through passport control.

34:02.791 --> 34:05.703
Passport control were saying:
"Roberto, Roberto, passport!"

34:05.752 --> 34:09.210
He was like: "No, no, no"
and he took me right through.

34:09.255 --> 34:13.168
I thought "How famous are you
to take me right through passport control?"

34:13.217 --> 34:17.757
Wherever restaurant we went to,
we would never have to pay anything

34:17.806 --> 34:21.139
because he would always say:
"People love me here."

34:21.184 --> 34:24.597
So it was a treat to see him
in his home town, in his country

34:24.646 --> 34:26.261
where people adore him.

JUAN CARLOS TAPIA IN SPANISH:

ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH:

35:17.782 --> 35:20.239
He's still like a little boy, you know?

35:20.285 --> 35:22.617
I come into his house
and he's watching cartoons.

35:23.872 --> 35:25.783
You know, he didn't have a childhood.

35:26.458 --> 35:28.870
It's part of what he is today.

35:29.169 --> 35:30.579
It gave him that anger to fight.

35:38.470 --> 35:41.758
ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH:

35:52.150 --> 35:55.358
Only people who doesn't have places
to live go to El Chorillo.

35:56.821 --> 35:58.186
People without work.

35:58.657 --> 36:01.069
People involved in detailing drugs.

36:01.117 --> 36:02.402
Criminal groups.

36:04.079 --> 36:05.159
That was El Chorillo.

36:08.375 --> 36:11.037
IN SPANISH:

36:32.982 --> 36:36.975
I think it's wine, women and song.
You know, the fighters work so hard

36:37.153 --> 36:39.735
and they live such a Spartan life

36:40.573 --> 36:45.237
that it's so difficult to maintain
that training regimen

36:45.286 --> 36:46.901
and that discipline

36:46.955 --> 36:51.494
and quite often you just wanna
enjoy your youth

36:51.543 --> 36:54.410
and they get a little carried away.

36:54.462 --> 36:56.874
They come from poverty
and they've never had anything

36:56.923 --> 37:01.462
and now they have millions of dollars
and temptation is just around the corner.

37:02.178 --> 37:07.093
Duran is not
the first great athlete or fighter

37:07.684 --> 37:10.801
who got more attracted by the distractions

37:11.438 --> 37:12.473
than the main event.

It's human. Young guys on top of the world.

37:17.277 --> 37:19.484
More money than they could imagine.

37:19.821 --> 37:21.937

BOB ARUM:
I remember visiting him at his house.

37:30.665 --> 37:32.576
There must have been 40 people

37:32.625 --> 37:36.459
and they were all laying around the pool

37:36.504 --> 37:39.871
with Dom Perignon champagne,
only the best.

37:39.924 --> 37:45.715
Cooking steaks
and living the high life on Duran's money.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.595
He partied... partied...

37:47.682 --> 37:51.049
Well, he celebrated, I should say,
he celebrated a lot more than I did.

37:52.061 --> 37:53.926
And I wanted to catch him off guard.

CROWD ROARS

37:56.232 --> 38:01.852
SUGAR RAY LEONARD: After the fight,
I was really emotionally just down.

38:01.905 --> 38:02.815
Devastating.

38:02.864 --> 38:06.448
But I took my wife to Hawaii
to kinda cool out.

38:06.493 --> 38:10.577
And while I was there, the first thing I did
the next morning was run, did road work.

38:10.622 --> 38:11.577
I'm running down the beach

38:11.623 --> 38:13.955
and people saying:
"Hey, Sugar, man, tough fight."

38:14.000 --> 38:17.743
"Hey, Sugar Ray, if you'd have boxed him,
you would have beat him."

38:17.796 --> 38:19.957
I kept hearing that: "If you had boxed him,
you would've beat him."

38:20.006 --> 38:21.246
"If you were boxing..."

38:21.424 --> 38:22.880
And something said: "Bing!"

38:23.468 --> 38:27.837
I called my partner, Mike Trainer.
I said: "Mike, I wanna fight Duran ASAP."

SPRINGS TOLEDO:
Training would not be spent

39:13.017 --> 39:16.180
devising new strategies and tactics
to defeat Sugar Ray Leonard

39:16.229 --> 39:19.471
who was now going to try
a different strategy of course. No.

39:20.024 --> 39:21.855
It was spent losing weight.

39:21.901 --> 39:23.983
This time around will be
a different story altogether.

39:24.028 --> 39:27.361
Me no like you, Leonard.
Leonard too much talk.

39:27.407 --> 39:29.693
Everybody rush out there, closed—circuit,
and get their tickets

39:29.742 --> 39:32.279
because this is gonna be World War / V.

39:32.328 --> 39:36.492
It's hard for an outsider to know
how prepared a fighter is

39:36.541 --> 39:41.001
even when he says, as he usually does,
that he's in the best shape of his life.

39:47.010 --> 39:50.673
SPORTSCASTER: Here we go,
the WBC Welterweight Championship.

39:50.722 --> 39:53.054
There ’3 Sugar Ray Leonard
in the black trunks

39:54.183 --> 39:57.425
and Roberto Dura’n, the champion
in the white trunks, from Panama.

39:57.478 --> 39:58.388
BELL RINGS

40:04.485 --> 40:08.478
SYLVESTER STALLONE:
Roberto Duran comes to battle.

40:08.823 --> 40:12.566
He knew that toe—to—toe,
he would win that fight.

40:12.619 --> 40:16.157
SPORTSCASTER:
And he ’3 even doing a little dodging now.

40:17.206 --> 40:18.195
A little A/I'.

40:19.375 --> 40:20.990
He ’3 taunting Dura’n.

40:21.377 --> 40:22.867
SYLVESTER STALLONE:
He didn't realise

40:22.921 --> 40:27.711
the strategy of Sugar Ray Leonard
was almost sleight of hand.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.624
Magic. Illusion.

40:30.261 --> 40:34.254
Duran became incredibly frustrated.
Embarrassed.

40:34.307 --> 40:37.970
SPORTSCASTER:
Sugar Ray is taunting Roberto Dura’n like Ali.

40:38.019 --> 40:41.011
Leonard was just too fast, too crafty

40:41.064 --> 40:44.272
and it got into the skin of Duran.

40:45.860 --> 40:47.816
LARRY MERCHANT:
Duran could not abide.

40:49.614 --> 40:55.405
Those eyes that used to stare at someone
and stare you down were now just, like, lost.

40:57.080 --> 40:59.537
The taunting that went on, the antics

40:59.582 --> 41:03.666
were to pour some acid on this machismo.

41:06.172 --> 41:07.878
SUGAR RAY LEONARD:
He had no cure.

41:07.924 --> 41:09.334
He had no response

41:09.550 --> 41:11.290
for what I was doing in that ring.

41:12.637 --> 41:14.923
SPORTSCASTER:
Sugar Ray is oozing confidence.

41:15.640 --> 41:16.504
Look at that!

41:17.976 --> 41:20.137
Well, he saw what to do and he did it.

41:20.186 --> 41:22.427
Old school fighters would frown upon that.

41:22.480 --> 41:25.017
A lot of old school commentators
back then frowned upon that.

41:25.066 --> 41:26.647
They did not like to see...

41:26.693 --> 41:30.527
Even Howard Cossell did not like to see
Sugar Ray Leonard acting in this manner

41:30.571 --> 41:32.903
against a great fighter like Roberto Duran.

41:32.949 --> 41:35.907
But Sugar Ray Leonard is gonna do
what works for Sugar Ray Leonard.

41:37.912 --> 41:42.201
Those things, those "antics" or whatever
you call them, happen in the ring.

41:42.250 --> 41:45.868
It always happened and you can't...
you don't think about doing that.

41:45.920 --> 41:49.629
You would never think about sticking
your chin out against Roberto Duran, trust me

41:49.674 --> 41:51.835
but it worked then and there, instinctively.

41:51.884 --> 41:53.499
It just naturally happened

41:54.345 --> 41:56.210
because I saw something in his eyes:

41:56.889 --> 41:59.596
I saw that he was not there.

42:01.227 --> 42:02.763
SPRINGS TOLEDO:
The crowd laughed.

42:02.812 --> 42:05.019
The people began to laugh at Roberto Duran.

42:05.606 --> 42:07.471
SPORTSCASTER:
Both men can throw lethal bombs.

42:07.525 --> 42:10.358
LARRY MERCHANT:
The machismo at that point said...

42:10.403 --> 42:14.988
"Enough, I'm not going to be humiliated
like this anymore."

42:17.577 --> 42:19.067

Hey, what’s happening?

42:27.086 --> 42:28.201
Dura’n says no!

42:29.213 --> 42:30.328
/ think he ’s quitting.

42:31.716 --> 42:34.173
What is he saying, Larry?
- LARRY: He says no.

42:34.218 --> 42:36.550
/ don ’t understand it.
- SPORTSCASTER: He ’3 saying no. He quit!

42:36.596 --> 42:38.177
LARRY:
/ don ’t understand this.

42:38.222 --> 42:41.134

42:47.607 --> 42:48.687

This is not like Duran.

42:48.733 --> 42:50.394
BROADCASTER: threw his hands up

42:50.443 --> 42:51.478
LARRY:
/ don ’t understand this.

42:51.527 --> 42:54.018
SPORTSCASTER: And he almost got
in a fight with Leonard ’s brother.

42:54.405 --> 42:55.611
The police are in the ring

42:55.656 --> 42:58.989
and we have
a very, very unpleasant situation in there.

42:59.035 --> 43:00.070
LARRY:
/ don ’t understand this.

43:00.119 --> 43:03.282
SPORTSCASTER: The referee
has not declared the fight over yet.

43:04.082 --> 43:06.323
Duran sudden/y said: "/ quit”.

43:07.335 --> 43:10.293
LARRY: / don ’t understand it.
- SPORTSCASTER: / don ’t either.

43:11.339 --> 43:12.875
And then he did it a second time.

/ don ’t understand it.

43:14.467 --> 43:16.332

43:19.722 --> 43:21.212
He ’3 saying: "/ don ’t want it anymore ”.

43:23.518 --> 43:26.305
And there ’3 no question,
ladies and gentlemen

43:26.354 --> 43:29.938
that Sugar Ray Leonard has retaken

43:29.982 --> 43:32.894
the World ’3 Welterweight Championship

43:32.944 --> 43:36.027
in round eight when Dura’n surrendered.
VOICE FADES

43:36.072 --> 43:40.031
IN SPANISH:

43:53.005 --> 43:56.042
I could not be more stunned

43:57.718 --> 44:00.209
at anything that ever happened
in a prize fight

44:00.888 --> 44:03.971
than seeing Roberto Duran quit.

44:05.601 --> 44:07.182
The crowd was shocked.

44:07.228 --> 44:09.344
Worldwide, it was shocking.

44:10.523 --> 44:14.015
In Spanish, no ma’s means "no more".

44:14.068 --> 44:15.808
The fight became the No Mas fight.

44:16.737 --> 44:20.229
All you had to say or all that was written
was "no mas".

44:20.283 --> 44:23.867
When he did so many good things,
so many great things in boxing

44:24.662 --> 44:26.618
than that simple phrase.

44:27.665 --> 44:33.001
Some people forget about him being
the greatest lightweight champion of all time

44:33.045 --> 44:34.876
and they simply say: "No mas".

44:34.922 --> 44:38.540
Now, Luis, exactly what happened
in Roberto ’3 words?

44:38.801 --> 44:40.541
HE SPEAKS SPANISH

44:46.851 --> 44:50.218
He got cramps in his stomach
and his body, upper body.

44:50.271 --> 44:51.477
And then his arms.

44:51.522 --> 44:55.106
And he got weaker,
so that’s why he stopped, he quit the bout.

44:55.902 --> 44:58.689
Does this mean the end
of boxing for Roberto?

44:58.738 --> 45:01.571
THEY SPEAK SPANISH

45:01.616 --> 45:03.106
”Yes, I’m not fighting anymore. ”

45:03.159 --> 45:05.445
This is final, permanent retirement?

45:07.079 --> 45:08.319
”Definite/y, I’m not fighting anymore. ”

45:08.956 --> 45:11.948
SPORTSCASTER: Leonard scored
with a chopping right that hurt Dura’n.

45:12.001 --> 45:14.913
When Dura’n motioned that that was it

45:15.546 --> 45:20.131
/ just felt that / beat a man, a legend,
mental/y

45:20.301 --> 45:22.007
you know, more so than physical/y.

45:23.221 --> 45:24.961
DON KING:
Ray Leonard was using his skills

45:25.014 --> 45:28.927
and his physical adroitness
and his mental capacity

45:28.976 --> 45:30.341
to be able to do that.

45:30.394 --> 45:34.387
He played the mental gymnastics
as well as the physical.

45:34.440 --> 45:37.648
Duran was right for it.
You know, instead of him readjusting

45:38.486 --> 45:41.899
he stayed on that same mode,
and so since he got frustrated

45:41.948 --> 45:45.190
with that misguided emotionalism
and passion

45:45.243 --> 45:49.202
he then played right into Ray's hands,
but Ray wasn't expecting him to stop.

45:52.250 --> 45:53.581
IN SPANISH:

46:15.940 --> 46:19.478
Sugar Ray had a plan and, you know,
his plan worked.

46:19.527 --> 46:21.063
To frustrate him, not to fight him.

46:21.112 --> 46:24.229
If anybody come to fight Duran,
he'll fight you to the death

46:24.282 --> 46:26.068
but, you know, he gets caught up

46:26.117 --> 46:30.360
in that macho mentality,
"He's not fighting me, he's not the man."

46:30.413 --> 46:35.703
I think for a man who, in his chest
beats the heart of a warrior

46:35.751 --> 46:39.494
the frustration and the embarrassment
and the pressure from the audience

46:42.591 --> 46:43.797
I'm sure he's...

46:45.428 --> 46:47.840
regrets that moment every day.

46:48.806 --> 46:51.889
There is no amount of money.
There is nobody that can do anything

46:51.934 --> 46:55.722
that would help this man
with the destruction of his reputation

46:55.771 --> 46:58.137
or the doubt
that has been cast upon his reputation

46:58.190 --> 46:59.771
and he ’3 going to be out of boxing.

46:59.817 --> 47:01.648
He ’l/ have to live that
for the rest of his life.

47:01.694 --> 47:03.559
It’s gonna be a real traumatic experience.

47:03.612 --> 47:06.103
HOWARD COSSELL:
Ray, you heard what Duran said.

47:06.157 --> 47:08.148
Will you fight him again, ever?

47:09.452 --> 47:10.783
No, Howard.

47:10.870 --> 47:12.201
It's a painful moment.

47:12.246 --> 47:16.330
It's a painful moment for boxing history
because it did hurt the sport.

47:16.375 --> 47:19.867
It not only hurt Duran,
it really demolished his reputation.

47:19.920 --> 47:21.956
But it also hurt everything about the sport

47:22.006 --> 47:24.873
because people paid good money
to see a great rematch

47:25.676 --> 47:29.134
and what happened
was Duran basically ripped everybody off.

47:29.764 --> 47:33.097
I’ve never seen
this young man behave in this manner.

47:33.768 --> 47:35.929
I’ve been with him nine years.

47:35.978 --> 47:37.843
He ’3 been through tough fights

47:38.606 --> 47:40.642
and l was absolutely astounded.

47:40.691 --> 47:44.900
/ wish / could give you an honest answer,
Howard, of what really happened.

47:44.945 --> 47:47.402
This is my interpretation,
I'm not sure if I'm right

47:47.448 --> 47:52.568
but he was disappointed, deeply disappointed
that he would pull out like that

47:54.163 --> 47:58.907
and probably heartbroken in some ways
because you just don't do that.

48:00.461 --> 48:01.621
It was just one of those...

48:03.506 --> 48:05.167
too human moments...

48:06.967 --> 48:09.049
of weakness.

48:11.097 --> 48:15.010
"But to thine own self one must be true",
as Shakespeare would say.

48:17.353 --> 48:20.720
The man in the mirror knows
that he did that to himself

48:20.773 --> 48:24.982
because of that machismo, macho attitude

48:25.027 --> 48:27.313
and life that he had lived,
you know what I mean?

How do you go back to your people, your fans

49:10.448 --> 49:15.442
who have constructed a part
of their lives around you

49:16.454 --> 49:18.365
who worship you and look up to you?

49:18.414 --> 49:21.622
You become a champion,
you have an entourage of 50 people

49:21.667 --> 49:25.660
carrying your suitcase, your backpack,
giving you water, cleaning your sweat.

49:26.464 --> 49:29.376
You lose your championship,
you lose your money, you have nobody again.

49:33.095 --> 49:36.337
ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH:

49:45.900 --> 49:48.312
REPORTER: Good evening.
One of Central America ’s best known

49:48.360 --> 49:51.227
military and political leaders,
General Omar Torrijos

49:51.280 --> 49:55.444
has died in a plane crash in the jungle,
91 miles outside of Panama City.

49:55.493 --> 49:56.733
He was 52.

49:56.911 --> 49:58.492
REPORTER 2:
The Panamanian National Guard

49:58.537 --> 50:00.949
gave their General a military farewell

50:00.998 --> 50:03.614
complete with a motorcycle escort
and cavalry.

50:03.667 --> 50:06.500
Torrijos’ coffin draped
with the Panamanian flag

50:06.545 --> 50:08.501
was carried up the steps
to the cathedral

50:08.547 --> 50:11.254
on the shoulders of the
members of his national guard.

50:11.300 --> 50:12.631
He was their commander and chief.

50:12.676 --> 50:15.463
DON KING:
Torrijos is a victim of the system.

50:16.096 --> 50:19.088
That he was such an advocate for the people

50:19.141 --> 50:23.510
and next thing you know,
his plane is crashing into a mountain.

50:23.562 --> 50:26.474
An accident, but in my opinion by design

50:27.107 --> 50:30.941
and the world lost a great statesman,
a great scholar, a great fighter.

50:31.737 --> 50:35.650
Torrijos became a symbol of protest

50:35.699 --> 50:37.985
a symbol of a different military

50:38.035 --> 50:42.028
and also identified with the lower class

50:42.081 --> 50:44.823
with the workers, with people like Duran.

50:45.084 --> 50:46.949
WOMEN WAIL

50:47.336 --> 50:50.749
ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH:

51:36.218 --> 51:39.335
JOHN DINGES: Panama never was
the same again after Torrijos.

51:40.514 --> 51:44.302
Of course, his death leads
to the rise of Noriega.

51:46.687 --> 51:48.393
APPLAUSE

51:48.939 --> 51:52.397
RUBEN PAREDES IN SPANISH:

52:06.957 --> 52:09.664
JOHN DINGES:
Noriega had a relationship with the CIA

52:13.255 --> 52:15.371
very intimate and very profitable.

52:15.424 --> 52:19.212
He goes on the CIA payroll
and the Pentagon payroll

52:19.261 --> 52:23.630
cooperating with the US on the one hand
and violating US law on the other hand.

52:24.516 --> 52:27.553
IN SPANISH:

52:37.738 --> 52:42.653
JOHN DINGES: He begins a relationship
with the Medillin Cartel, Pablo Escobar

52:42.701 --> 52:46.990
at a time when drug trafficking is starting
to explode coming out of Colombia.

52:47.790 --> 52:50.452
Panama becomes one
of the most important havens

52:50.501 --> 52:52.913
for laundering
millions and millions of dollars

52:52.961 --> 52:56.920
being produced by trafficking cocaine,
marijuana, in and out of the United States.

52:56.965 --> 53:00.002
Panama was where business was being done

53:00.052 --> 53:04.011
and Noriega was facilitating drug operations
in his country.

53:05.557 --> 53:09.596
Noriega has taken control literally
at the point of a gun.

53:10.813 --> 53:15.523
It's absolutely irresponsible for anyone
to think the people of Panama want him

53:15.609 --> 53:16.644
they don't.

53:20.823 --> 53:23.940
MANUEL NORIEGA IN SPANISH:

54:20.966 --> 54:22.376
HE CHUCKLES

54:27.222 --> 54:29.008
HE LAUGHS

54:29.308 --> 54:30.844
See? I tell you.

54:43.739 --> 54:45.604
SUGAR RAY LEONARD:
It's not easy to come back

54:46.408 --> 54:47.614
after being ridiculed.

54:48.535 --> 54:51.026
After being looked down upon.

54:51.246 --> 54:56.331
It's gonna do one of two things to you.
It's gonna make you a better fighter

54:56.460 --> 54:57.870
or it's gonna destroy you.

55:00.047 --> 55:02.333
IN SPANISH:

55:21.193 --> 55:25.607
FELICIDAD DURAN IN SPANISH:

55:41.880 --> 55:45.793
ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH:

55:53.684 --> 55:56.141
RICKY HATTON: The first time you find out
how good a fighter you are

55:56.186 --> 55:57.801
and how big a man you are in boxing

55:57.855 --> 56:01.973
when you've gotta drag your backside up
off the floor and come back from adversity

56:02.025 --> 56:06.860
which is what Roberto found himself
having to do after the No Mas fight.

56:12.077 --> 56:14.033
REPORTER:
This is the island of Coiba

56:14.079 --> 56:17.446
a tough penal colony
and a sort of De vil’s Island

56:17.499 --> 56:20.161
where Panama ’3 most menacing criminals
are sent.

56:20.794 --> 56:22.000
It’s also become home

56:22.045 --> 56:25.037
to one of the most bizarre training camps
of all time.

56:25.591 --> 56:28.958
Roberto Duran has spent
the last six weeks working here

56:29.011 --> 56:31.627
sweating himself into shape,
surrounding himself

56:31.680 --> 56:35.264
with men much harder,
meaner and tougher than him.

56:36.560 --> 56:38.346
SPORTSCASTER:
Good right hand by Kirk/and Laing.

56:38.395 --> 56:40.807
A lead right
and that tagged Dura’n on the chin.

56:42.608 --> 56:44.223
Duran had a go at Laing...

56:44.860 --> 56:47.317
IN SPANISH:

56:50.032 --> 56:51.818
SPORTSCASTER:
/ don ’t wanna remember Duran this way.

56:51.867 --> 56:54.734
At 31 years of age, it may be all over

56:55.662 --> 56:57.027
for Hands of Stone.

56:57.915 --> 57:00.076
IN SPANISH:

57:05.631 --> 57:07.747
Being a champion is very important.

57:07.799 --> 57:09.960
I would say if I didn't lose in my career

57:10.010 --> 57:14.379
I wouldn't know how great I would have been,
cos it put me in a place

57:14.431 --> 57:18.595
and then it was for me, mentally
and physically, to get myself out of it

57:18.644 --> 57:20.430
and show that I'm a true champion.

57:20.479 --> 57:22.060
SPORTSCASTER:
Cuevas against the ropes

57:22.105 --> 57:24.061
down for the second time in the round.

57:24.733 --> 57:26.644
Cue vas a beaten fighter.

57:26.693 --> 57:29.150
Dura’n, a good right hand set it all off

57:29.696 --> 57:30.902
went to the kill.

57:31.698 --> 57:34.565
Roberto Dura’n back
in the title picture again.

57:35.243 --> 57:36.904
In fact, he will be fighting

57:36.954 --> 57:39.696
Davey Moore
for the Junior Middle weight Championship.

57:40.832 --> 57:42.197
Pandemonium in the ring.

57:42.751 --> 57:45.163
CROWD ROARS

57:46.505 --> 57:48.962
CROWD CHANTS:
Dura’n!

57:49.091 --> 57:50.922
Dura’n!

57:51.301 --> 57:53.587
Dura’n!

57:54.846 --> 57:56.382
BELL RINGS

57:56.556 --> 58:00.344
SPRINGS TOLEDO: For Duran to consent
to step in the ring with Davey Moore

58:00.894 --> 58:01.804
twenty—four years old

58:01.853 --> 58:04.515
one of the best junior middleweights
in the world

58:04.564 --> 58:06.725
so long after Duran's prime

58:06.775 --> 58:09.266
so far out of his natural division

58:09.319 --> 58:12.903
against a fighter who has exceeded
Sugar Ray Leonard's dimensions...

58:12.948 --> 58:15.064
Once again Duran was an underdog.

58:18.704 --> 58:21.411
MIKE TYSON: I'm 17 years old,
I'm in Madison Square Garden

58:21.456 --> 58:23.196
and right there in the front row

58:23.250 --> 58:25.332
and I'm going: "Yeah, yeah yeah!"
And he goes like this.

58:26.294 --> 58:29.127
Yo, he was looking at me!
Well, that was a sign.

58:29.172 --> 58:31.083
That's a sign I'm gonna make it big.

58:31.133 --> 58:34.216
cos he saw me out of all those thousands
of people. I thought it was all about me.

58:34.261 --> 58:36.047
He don't fucking know me!

58:40.225 --> 58:42.841
MARVIN HANGLER:
Davey Moore was up—and—coming

58:42.894 --> 58:47.012
and Roberto Duran showed me what kind
of skill that he really had at that time.

58:52.988 --> 58:55.274
ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH:

59:08.670 --> 59:10.706
CROWD CHEERS

59:30.984 --> 59:32.690
ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH:

59:33.445 --> 59:37.029
When he won the fight as an underdog,
which nobody expected him to win

59:37.074 --> 59:40.612
I think he made the people of Panama
very, very proud of him again.

59:40.702 --> 59:42.363
CROWD CHEERS

59:51.171 --> 59:52.786
ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH:

59:56.635 --> 59:58.500
CROWD CHANTS:
Dura’n!

01:00:04.726 --> 01:00:06.717
SPORTSCASTER:
On his 32nd birthday last night

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:10.354
challenger Roberto Duran knocked out
24—year—old Davey Moore

01:00:10.398 --> 01:00:14.391
to win the World Boxing Association,
Junior Middle weight Championship.

01:00:19.407 --> 01:00:21.819
CROWD CHEERS

01:00:27.582 --> 01:00:29.664
LARRY MERCHANT:
There's no doubt that beating Moore

01:00:29.709 --> 01:00:33.201
brought Duran back to life
as a prize fighter.

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:35.958
FELICIDAD DURAN IN SPANISH:

01:00:46.143 --> 01:00:48.976
ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH:

01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:09.739
The '80s was really dominated
by the Four Kings.

01:01:09.791 --> 01:01:11.122
They all fought each other.

01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:13.250
Sugar Ray Leonard, Marvin Hagler...

01:01:13.295 --> 01:01:14.205
lt’s war.

01:01:14.254 --> 01:01:16.711
MAURICIO SULAIMAN:
Tommy Hearns. Roberto Duran.

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:22.210
Those four, they truly represent
perhaps the best times of boxing.

01:01:24.723 --> 01:01:27.214
BOB ARUM:
Everybody thought initially

01:01:27.267 --> 01:01:30.009
that once Muhammad Ali departed
from the scene

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:34.683
that boxing would suffer
a real terrible blow.

01:01:34.733 --> 01:01:37.019
But it was those four fighters

01:01:37.068 --> 01:01:40.026
that revitalised the sport during the '80s.

01:01:40.697 --> 01:01:42.278
They fought nine times

01:01:43.116 --> 01:01:45.027
in various combinations

01:01:45.076 --> 01:01:49.615
and every time they fought,
it was a major, major event.

01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:52.618
LARRY MERCHANT:
Each fight among them

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:56.118
became a drama.

01:01:56.171 --> 01:01:58.662
Oh, not since Cain and Abel
have you seen one like this.

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:00.376
Every fight was an event.

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:03.883
OSCAR DE LA HOYA:
The Four Kings era without Roberto Duran

01:02:03.929 --> 01:02:05.794
it wouldn't have been the same.

01:02:05.847 --> 01:02:09.055
He was a fighter
who would take on all challengers.

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:12.342
He would move up several weight classes
and challenge the very best.

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:14.386
He was a serious threat to anybody.

01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:18.098
SPORTSCASTER:
And indeed this historic event is

01:02:18.151 --> 01:02:20.563
Roberto Duran challenging
Marvelous Marvin Hag/er

01:02:20.612 --> 01:02:23.069
for the undisputed
Middle weight Championship.

01:02:23.281 --> 01:02:26.193
FELICIDAD DURAN IN SPANISH:

01:02:38.338 --> 01:02:40.249
Back in the day, you fought the best.

01:02:40.298 --> 01:02:43.506
You had to work yourself in the rankings
to become a champion.

01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:47.302
They all wanted to fight each other.
They wanted to fight each other.

01:02:47.347 --> 01:02:50.714
They didn't have to,
they didn't make 'em, they wanted it.

01:02:52.227 --> 01:02:55.094
SYLVESTER STALLONE: This was an era
when dinosaurs ruled the Earth.

01:02:55.146 --> 01:02:58.730
These were the real deals, real specimens

01:02:58.775 --> 01:03:03.144
and Hagler was perfection
in his particular weight class

01:03:03.196 --> 01:03:05.608
which is much bigger than Roberto.

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:09.908
Basically, this guy was trying
to take away my title

01:03:10.662 --> 01:03:15.952
and I said: "No. There's no way that you're
going to take away my title," you know.

01:03:16.001 --> 01:03:19.414
It was a psych game, like,
going on between him and I.

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:26.420
Two day more, you no more champion.
- OK.

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:29.176
He was at the height of his game
at nine stone, nine.

01:03:29.222 --> 01:03:32.931
And all of a sudden, he fights one
of the greatest middleweights of all time.

01:03:32.976 --> 01:03:34.637
Up at 11 stone, six.

01:03:34.686 --> 01:03:36.677
Every morning, I used to see his ugly face.

01:03:37.355 --> 01:03:39.266
My entourage and his entourage

01:03:39.316 --> 01:03:40.977
we used to run around the dunes.

01:03:41.026 --> 01:03:45.315
We would see each other like 4:30
in the morning and just before the fight

01:03:45.363 --> 01:03:47.524
and we go, "Rrrrrr!"

01:03:47.574 --> 01:03:49.610
And he goes, "Rrrrrr!"

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:52.401
ROBERTO DURAN SPEAKS SPANISH

01:03:56.249 --> 01:03:58.831
He says: "Thank you very, very much
to all of you ”

01:03:58.877 --> 01:04:01.038
and he don ’t care of nothing

01:04:01.087 --> 01:04:03.578
because he knows how to do it
on top of the ring.

01:04:03.631 --> 01:04:07.044
REPORTER: / notice you didn’t shake his hand.
Has the psyching already started toward that?

01:04:07.093 --> 01:04:09.550
MARVIN HANGLER:
Oh, yeah. Roberto ’3 very tricky, very cagey.

01:04:09.596 --> 01:04:11.461
Uh, he ’s got a lot of heart.

01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:13.888
One thing that / believe
that / won ’t have to look for him.

01:04:13.933 --> 01:04:15.673
So, it’s going to be an exciting fight.

01:04:15.727 --> 01:04:17.342
You ’re gonna see a good performance.

01:04:17.395 --> 01:04:20.853
I’m sure Duran is going
to give a good account of himself

01:04:20.899 --> 01:04:23.436
HANGLER FAN:
He ’3 too strong, much too fast for Dura’n.

01:04:23.485 --> 01:04:24.600
He ’3 in better shape.

01:04:25.028 --> 01:04:26.689
He ’3 got just as much experience.

01:04:26.738 --> 01:04:30.276
DURAN FAN: The last time Hag/er had a fight
was against Vito Antofuermo five years ago.

01:04:30.325 --> 01:04:32.657
He hasn ’t had a fight since
and Dura’n’s gonna give him a fight

01:04:32.702 --> 01:04:35.569
cos Duran ’s gonna hit him downstairs,
Duran’s gonna hit him upstairs.

01:04:35.622 --> 01:04:37.988
And it’s gonna be all over
within a short time.

01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:39.997
CROWD CHANTS:
Dura’n!

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:44.206
To do a 15—round fight in that heat,
outdoors...

01:04:44.255 --> 01:04:46.792
They weren't in the casinos now,
and the air conditioning.

01:04:46.841 --> 01:04:49.753
That was absolutely unbelievable.

01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:52.259
CROWD ROARS

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:54.796
MARVIN HANGLER:
The way that I look at that fight, I mean

01:04:54.849 --> 01:04:58.808
it was two great champions going in,
teaching each other

01:04:59.187 --> 01:05:01.428
what kind of skills that they had.

01:05:01.481 --> 01:05:03.267
SPORTSCASTER:
Middle weight Championship of the world.

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:05.397
SPORTSCASTER 2:
Hag/er, of course, familiar to most people

01:05:05.443 --> 01:05:06.478
that left—handed style.

01:05:06.528 --> 01:05:10.316
Remember, he will switch to righty
at various times throughout this fight.

01:05:10.365 --> 01:05:12.196
IN SPANISH:

01:05:17.247 --> 01:05:19.408
For the first three rounds,
what he would do was

01:05:19.457 --> 01:05:22.164
every time that I would throw a right hand

01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:23.370
he would counter—punch.

01:05:23.962 --> 01:05:27.796
And I says: "Hmm" for three rounds
and I'm asking my trainer

01:05:27.841 --> 01:05:29.547
"How the hell does this guy
keep catching me?"

01:05:30.093 --> 01:05:34.632
"He's a smart warrior
and he's timing your punch."

01:05:35.515 --> 01:05:38.348
So, what we had to do was
we had to go to school on him

01:05:38.977 --> 01:05:42.515
show him who he's in there with,
switch up on him

01:05:42.689 --> 01:05:44.520
and every time that he would do
that right hand...

01:05:45.066 --> 01:05:47.182
Boom, I hit him with a body shot

01:05:47.235 --> 01:05:50.819
and I hear him go, "Ugh!"
HE LAUGHS

01:05:51.072 --> 01:05:53.563
He can't believe
that he's getting hit this much

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:56.323
because nobody hits Roberto Duran
that much.

01:05:56.369 --> 01:05:58.906
"You hit me, do you know who I am?"

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:01.867
I say: "Yeah,
and you gonna get some more, too.

01:06:01.916 --> 01:06:03.577
C'mon!"
HE LAUGHS

01:06:05.044 --> 01:06:08.502
SPORTSCASTER: Big left hand from Hag/er
on the chin of Duran but Duran is OK.

01:06:08.548 --> 01:06:10.630
RICKY HATTON:
The fight was toe—to—toe, nonstop.

01:06:10.675 --> 01:06:13.337
There was barely a foot, two foot
between them the whole fight

01:06:13.386 --> 01:06:15.968
because Roberto Duran fought that way
and Marvin fought that way.

01:06:16.014 --> 01:06:17.595
It was always going to be
a close—quarter fight

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.426
so that for a 15—round fight...

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:21.341
Fantastic, fantastic stuff.

01:06:21.394 --> 01:06:22.600
SPORTSCASTER:
Here in this 15th round.

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:26.012
Ripping, body and head shots
to the head of Roberto Dura’n.

01:06:26.065 --> 01:06:27.726
MARVIN HANGLER:
I give him a lot of credit, man.

01:06:27.775 --> 01:06:32.394
He was so experienced that he knew
how to keep bouncing off the rope

01:06:32.447 --> 01:06:34.984
and bobbing and weaving
and avoiding some of the punches.

01:06:36.284 --> 01:06:38.320
ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH:

01:06:44.792 --> 01:06:48.751
SPORTSCASTER: Two warriors,
two champions going the full 15 rounds.

01:06:49.881 --> 01:06:54.420
MARVIN HANGLER: I tell you,
in about 30 more seconds in the 15th round

01:06:54.469 --> 01:06:56.209
I would have knocked Roberto Duran out.

01:06:56.262 --> 01:06:58.548
I had him. I had him.

ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH:

01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:15.145
Duran stole the drama of the show

01:07:15.198 --> 01:07:17.940
simply by going 15 rounds
with Marvin Hagler.

01:07:18.535 --> 01:07:22.027
Having a fighter like Roberto Duran,
that brings out the best in you

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:23.991
and that's what he did for me.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:26.531
He pushed him all the way,
do you know what I mean?

01:07:26.584 --> 01:07:28.666
Stood there and had it out with him,
it was...

01:07:29.212 --> 01:07:31.669
From someone who was a 9 stone, nine,
a lightweight fighter

01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:34.376
to fight out with one of the strongest
and best middleweights of all time.

01:07:34.425 --> 01:07:36.507
I think, you know, it ended in his defeat

01:07:36.553 --> 01:07:39.465
but it's again, another one of them,
bit by bit

01:07:39.514 --> 01:07:42.176
each fight and each fight he was having

01:07:42.225 --> 01:07:45.262
he was getting the respect back
from the Panamanian people.

01:07:46.688 --> 01:07:49.930
IN SPANISH:

01:08:11.045 --> 01:08:13.752
To me, it isn't always about the victories

01:08:14.299 --> 01:08:20.920
cos Duran, every fight had just...
elements of drama

01:08:20.971 --> 01:08:22.803
that other fighters just don't have.

01:08:22.849 --> 01:08:25.807
Every one is almost like a movie in itself.

01:08:26.477 --> 01:08:29.264
SPRINGS TOLEDO:
If you look at the pattern of Duran's career

01:08:29.314 --> 01:08:32.147
it's pretty rare, especially after 1979

01:08:32.191 --> 01:08:34.477
where he could be inspired
for a fight twice in a row.

01:08:35.028 --> 01:08:39.020
To fight Hearns on the heels of Hagler,
that's insanity.

01:08:40.617 --> 01:08:43.984
SPORTSCASTER: No longer will he be called
the Motor City Cobra.

01:08:44.037 --> 01:08:47.575
He has returned as Thomas The Hitman.

ROBERTO DURAN IN SPANISH:

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:55.124
He had that real devil, evil in his eye,
you know?

01:08:55.173 --> 01:08:57.915
He, you know...
Like he wanted to hurt his opponents.

01:08:58.551 --> 01:08:59.756
SPRINGS TOLEDO:
Duran predicted

01:08:59.801 --> 01:09:02.464
he's going to knock Tommy Hearns out
in one round.

01:09:02.513 --> 01:09:06.426
Thomas Hearns said: "I'm going to knock
Roberto Duran out in two rounds."

01:09:07.852 --> 01:09:09.216
LARRY MERCHANT:
It was apparent in that fight

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:12.761
that Hearns had no respect for Duran.

I was very young, I was a kid.

01:09:32.042 --> 01:09:34.408
And they flew me over with my mum

01:09:36.089 --> 01:09:38.751

trying to make the weight.

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:42.087
IN SPANISH:

01:09:46.683 --> 01:09:50.050

01:10:01.781 --> 01:10:04.944
You know, he's usually the crazy guy
who loves his kid

01:10:04.992 --> 01:10:07.904
and he's always hugging us
and, you know, playing with us.

01:10:07.954 --> 01:10:13.244

01:10:36.315 --> 01:10:38.306

STEVE LOTT:
When that punch landed, it was a "pop".

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:58.428
You could hear it from ringside
through the ropes into the microphone.

01:11:58.481 --> 01:12:01.439
That was definitely the hardest punch
Duran ever got hit with.

01:12:01.484 --> 01:12:03.145

01:12:14.914 --> 01:12:20.329
Duran was no longer a elite level fighter.

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:24.878
He's like: "I can still get in the ring
and beat everybody up and..."

01:12:24.924 --> 01:12:25.788
You know...

01:12:26.676 --> 01:12:28.257
It was sort of a pressure for us too

because everybody coming up to us
and like: "Your father should retire."

01:12:33.266 --> 01:12:37.054

”A fighter can look like

01:13:55.556 --> 01:13:58.047
That’s happened to Roberto Dura’n,
like, three times.

01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:01.638
We all wrote him off and all of a sudden
the guy comes back again.

01:14:01.687 --> 01:14:04.474
This is going to be some test
for a 37—year—old guy

01:14:04.523 --> 01:14:06.479
against a tough guy like lran Barkley.

01:14:06.525 --> 01:14:11.861
He has the heart of a champion, of a warrior,
and no matter if you're 100 years old or not

01:14:11.906 --> 01:14:13.737
you're still going to want to fight

01:14:13.783 --> 01:14:14.818

01:15:02.206 --> 01:15:04.913
and to see if Iran The Blade Barkley...

01:15:04.959 --> 01:15:09.578
Iran Barkley was a rough, tough guy
who was from the streets of the Bronx.

01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:11.245
He was member of a street gang.

01:15:11.799 --> 01:15:13.209
He was 28 years old.

He was in perfect condition.

01:15:15.386 --> 01:15:17.001
He was a huge middleweight.

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:24.725
I was in school...

01:15:25.271 --> 01:15:27.762
and I remember my teachers telling me:

01:15:28.441 --> 01:15:32.104
"Don't let your father do this fight,"
you know, "he's going to get killed."

01:15:33.029 --> 01:15:35.816
You know, I saw Iran Barkley

These guys is the past.
I gotta be the present.

01:15:43.456 --> 01:15:47.540

01:15:47.585 --> 01:15:50.418
to where I came from and what I've done.

01:15:51.213 --> 01:15:53.625
I'm gonna make you respect me.

01:15:54.717 --> 01:15:57.208
A promoter would say to a fighter

01:15:57.344 --> 01:16:01.087
"If you want to fight,
your name power is still big enough

01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:02.801

Being very, very proud of your people

01:16:21.494 --> 01:16:23.109
makes you not want to let them down.

01:16:23.704 --> 01:16:27.117
You can't tell me he didn't think
of that one fight against Sugar Ray Leonard

01:16:27.166 --> 01:16:30.033
and when he quit,
every time he stepped in a ring.

01:16:30.461 --> 01:16:33.043
He thought to himself:
"I can't quit in this one."

01:16:34.507 --> 01:16:37.999
You can look into a man's eyes,
you can see his soul.

01:16:40.387 --> 01:16:41.752
You don't scare me.

01:16:42.973 --> 01:16:45.510
Having the guts and having the desire

01:16:45.559 --> 01:16:48.972

01:18:45.512 --> 01:18:47.423
This has been extraordinary.

01:18:47.598 --> 01:18:49.213
BELL RINGS

01:18:58.609 --> 01:19:00.770
SPORTSCASTER:
That tells you who ’3 champion.

01:19:10.829 --> 01:19:14.913
The victory over Iran Barkley
was Duran's last act of defiance.

01:19:14.959 --> 01:19:17.541
I mean, with that victory,
he gave the finger to history.

01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:19.417
He gave the finger to Father Time.

01:19:19.463 --> 01:19:21.419
He gave the finger to the laws of physics.

01:19:21.465 --> 01:19:24.207
IN SPANISH:

01:20:28.282 --> 01:20:30.694
And now that we're friends,
I walk over to him, I say:

01:20:30.743 --> 01:20:34.076
"Hey, Roberto, how you doing, man?"
I said: "Let me ask you a question.

01:20:34.121 --> 01:20:35.611
Did you hate me that much?

01:20:35.664 --> 01:20:37.404
Did you really hate me that much?"

01:20:38.334 --> 01:20:39.574
And he looked at me.

01:20:41.045 --> 01:20:42.285
He took a deep breath.

01:20:44.131 --> 01:20:46.417
He said: "No, Ray, that was all...
It was all made up."

01:20:46.967 --> 01:20:50.255
There wasn't this mean spirit about him

01:20:50.804 --> 01:20:52.340
uh, when you got to know him.

01:20:52.973 --> 01:20:58.184
I mean, he was just a fun—loving guy
that you wanted to be around.

01:20:58.228 --> 01:21:01.641
There was a kind of, um... charming

01:21:02.399 --> 01:21:05.061
kind of boyishness to him, the humility.

01:21:05.152 --> 01:21:07.143
Tremendous heart, yes...

01:21:07.196 --> 01:21:10.609
A caring individual and just...
HE SIGHS

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:15.819
Man, as I said, I'm so happy
that he was... part of my lifetime.

01:21:17.456 --> 01:21:22.701
If you look at Roberto Duran, you look
at the heights and the depths of his career.

01:21:22.753 --> 01:21:23.993
You even look at No Mas.

01:21:24.755 --> 01:21:29.044
Ask yourself who in their lives
has not had a "no mas" moment?

01:21:35.599 --> 01:21:37.590
