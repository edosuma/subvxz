00:00.001 --> 00:00.429
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Okay, let's skip over the fact</i>
<i>that jane's a pregnant virgin.</i>

00:00.001 --> 00:06.772
<i>Who cares? Lots of way more</i>
<i>important stuff is going on.</i>

00:06.774 --> 00:08.307
<i>For one,</i>
<i>she discovered her father</i>

00:08.309 --> 00:09.775
<i>Is a famous telenovela star,</i>

00:09.777 --> 00:11.643
<i>And jane's mom was falling</i>
<i>for him.</i>

00:11.645 --> 00:12.644
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>jane has been teaching</i>

00:12.646 --> 00:14.313
<i>At a catholic high school.</i>

00:14.315 --> 00:15.714
<i>And despite</i>
<i>some initial hurdles...</i>

00:15.716 --> 00:17.549
You're selling coins
with my face on it?

00:17.551 --> 00:20.319
No. Not selling.
Distributing.

00:20.321 --> 00:22.521
<i>...Jane was in a groove.</i>
<i>Oh, and she recently</i>

00:22.523 --> 00:25.124
<i>Broke off an engagement</i>
<i>with michael, and she's dating</i>

00:25.126 --> 00:26.425
<i>Her baby daddy rafael.</i>

00:26.427 --> 00:28.327
<i>Rafael definitely</i>
<i>has some baggage.</i>

00:28.329 --> 00:30.562
<i>For one, his ex-wife petra.</i>
<i>See, she recently</i>

00:30.564 --> 00:33.565
<i>Teamed up with his archrival</i>
<i>lachlan to bring him down.</i>

00:33.567 --> 00:35.467
<i>But petra had problems</i>
<i>of her own.</i>

00:35.469 --> 00:37.302
<i>See, she was being</i>
<i>blackmailed by ivan,</i>

00:37.304 --> 00:38.303
<i>The man who knew</i>
<i>her secret identity.</i>

00:38.305 --> 00:39.805
Natalia.

00:39.807 --> 00:42.174
<i>And she had accidentally</i>
<i>taken him hostage.</i>

00:42.176 --> 00:45.744
<i>Problem was ivan escaped,</i>
<i>leaving petra in great danger.</i>

00:45.746 --> 00:47.179
<i>And michael was convinced</i>
<i>that rafael</i>

00:47.181 --> 00:48.814
<i>Was involved with sin rostro,</i>

00:48.816 --> 00:50.616
<i>A big, bad drug dealer.</i>
<i>And evidence</i>

00:50.618 --> 00:52.184
<i>Certainly pointed</i>
<i>to the solanos.</i>

00:52.186 --> 00:53.819
Rafael is definitely
a suspect, okay?

00:53.821 --> 00:55.687
But if he's involved,
I gotta think

00:55.689 --> 00:57.289
He's working for his father.

00:57.291 --> 00:59.291
I mean, emilio is the one
that financed the hotel.

00:59.293 --> 01:02.294
In fact, even emilio's wife was
<i>starting to suspect him.</i>

01:02.296 --> 01:04.296
Rafael, what if your father

01:04.298 --> 01:06.432
Is sin rostro?
<i>Really, I'm not sure</i>
<i>who sin rostro is,</i>

01:06.434 --> 01:08.434
<i>But at this rate,</i>
<i>we'll have to recap the recap,</i>

01:08.436 --> 01:09.501
<i>So let's just dive in.</i>

01:11.337 --> 01:13.739
Latin lover narrator:
<i>From a very young age,</i>

01:13.741 --> 01:15.741
<i>Jane gloriana villanueva</i>

01:15.743 --> 01:18.710
<i>Did her very best</i>
<i>to avoid conflict.</i>

01:18.712 --> 01:21.380
(alba yelling):

01:21.382 --> 01:23.782
Xiomara:
What? You'll kick me out?

01:23.784 --> 01:27.719
<i>Alas, it was</i>
<i>sometimes unavoidable.</i>

01:27.721 --> 01:29.788
Do it, and I'll
take jane with me.
No.

01:31.324 --> 01:33.792
Oh, no, she's not.
I'm her mother!

01:33.794 --> 01:35.794
We'll leave tomorrow.

01:35.796 --> 01:38.397
<i>Luckily, jane had her writing</i>

01:38.399 --> 01:42.434
<i>To help her navigate</i>
<i>these difficult moments.</i>

01:44.471 --> 01:46.405
<i>It's a letter, you see,</i>

01:46.407 --> 01:48.807
<i>Which she would slip</i>
<i>under her grandmother's door</i>

01:48.809 --> 01:52.111
<i>Late at night.</i>

01:52.113 --> 01:54.179
<i>And then, in the morning...</i>

01:59.552 --> 02:02.621
Xiomara: <i>Dear mom,</i>
<i>as usual I'm too proud</i>

02:02.623 --> 02:04.890
<i>To apologize face-to-face.</i>

02:04.892 --> 02:06.758
<i>But I'm sorry, okay?</i>

02:06.760 --> 02:08.360
<i>I was totally disrespectful,</i>

02:08.362 --> 02:09.895
<i>And I love you,</i>
<i>and I really appreciate</i>

02:09.897 --> 02:11.830
<i>Everything you do for me</i>
<i>and jane.</i>

02:11.832 --> 02:14.766
So can we just put it behind us
<i>and never talk about it again?</i>

02:14.768 --> 02:16.235
You know me; I get embarrassed.

02:16.237 --> 02:17.503
<i>Love, xo.</i>

02:29.516 --> 02:31.383
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

02:31.385 --> 02:34.520
<i>A letter wouldn't solve</i>
<i>jane's current problem.</i>

02:34.522 --> 02:36.522
I just really want you
and rafael to bond,

02:36.524 --> 02:38.524
And I think dinner together
will help.

02:38.526 --> 02:39.658
Hey!

02:39.660 --> 02:41.393
Come on, last cookie.

02:41.395 --> 02:42.528
I'm pregnant over here.
You asked me

02:42.530 --> 02:43.795
To get onboard; I'm onboard.

02:43.797 --> 02:45.531
I don't need to have dinner.

02:45.533 --> 02:47.933
You're, like, 40% onboard.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.434
And don't get me wrong,

02:49.436 --> 02:50.536
That is an improvement
from zero,

02:50.538 --> 02:52.838
But I want more.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.807
How much more
are you looking for?
Ma.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.709
This all just happened
so quickly

02:57.711 --> 02:59.411
In a really un-jane-like way.

02:59.413 --> 03:00.846
Yeah, and it happened,
and we're having a baby.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.414
And I don't want the fact

03:02.416 --> 03:04.349
That you didn't have
this textbook family

03:04.351 --> 03:06.552
To make you go after something
that maybe isn't right.

03:07.453 --> 03:09.521
But I think it is right.

03:13.560 --> 03:14.826
What?

03:14.828 --> 03:16.428
(chuckles)

03:16.430 --> 03:17.496
Nothing.

03:17.498 --> 03:20.332
Fine, let's do dinner.

03:20.334 --> 03:22.434
Jane:
<i>It's on. Tomorrow night.</i>

03:22.436 --> 03:24.369
That's great.
Can I call you back?

03:24.371 --> 03:25.571
What do you mean,

03:25.573 --> 03:26.605
"that's great"?

03:26.607 --> 03:27.973
That is not the right attitude.

03:27.975 --> 03:30.442
You have to crush this.
I will crush it.

03:30.444 --> 03:32.511
Say it with conviction.
I will <i>crush</i> it.

03:32.513 --> 03:33.979
I don't believe you.

03:33.981 --> 03:36.515
I will crush dinner
with your mom, okay?

03:36.517 --> 03:37.783
And there's someone here.

03:39.652 --> 03:40.852
Oh... Oh, yeah, sorry.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.621
We can prep later.

03:42.623 --> 03:44.590
Prep?
Jane: You have a lot to learn

03:44.592 --> 03:45.891
In a very short time.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.492
What is your study style?
Like, flashcards?

03:47.494 --> 03:48.660
Practice tests?

03:48.662 --> 03:49.795
I-I don't know.

03:49.797 --> 03:50.996
Gotcha.

03:50.998 --> 03:52.264
We'll do both.

03:57.470 --> 03:58.804
(sighs)

03:58.806 --> 04:00.539
Sorry about that.

04:00.541 --> 04:02.474
I am scared, rafael.

04:02.476 --> 04:05.410
Your father transferred
five million dollars to croatia.

04:07.614 --> 04:09.514
It doesn't mean he's involved
in anything criminal.

04:09.516 --> 04:11.283
But maybe he's trying
to flee. I...

04:11.285 --> 04:12.751
I think we should call
the police.

04:12.753 --> 04:13.785
Tell them what exactly?

04:13.787 --> 04:15.621
I-I don't know.

04:15.623 --> 04:17.489
Maybe he's involved
in whatever's going on here,

04:17.491 --> 04:21.493
With the tunnels
or sin rostro or whatever.

04:21.495 --> 04:22.628
I mean, it is his hotel.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.496
Yeah, it is,
and suspicions like yours

04:24.498 --> 04:26.765
Could threaten his reputation
and ruin his company.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.634
We can't go to the police.

04:28.636 --> 04:29.935
Not until we know for sure.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.370
So what do you want to do?

04:31.372 --> 04:32.571
Look, you said he's out of town

04:32.573 --> 04:33.772
For the next week, right?

04:33.774 --> 04:35.440
I called the contractor

04:35.442 --> 04:36.508
Who did our renovations.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.777
Let me just see
what I can find out,

04:38.779 --> 04:40.646
But give me until then.

04:40.648 --> 04:41.647
Nadine:
<i>We got nothin'.</i>

04:41.649 --> 04:43.515
We're no closer to sin rostro.

04:43.517 --> 04:46.451
The serbian could
be anywhere.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.520
Which is why we need
to put a tail on rafael.

04:48.522 --> 04:49.955
Armstrong said no.
We got the audit.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.657
We just have to comb
through the finances.

04:51.659 --> 04:53.592
Which could take weeks.
Family's powerful.

04:53.594 --> 04:55.661
We gotta go by the book.
Mm.

04:55.663 --> 04:57.529
Mongolian beef.

04:57.531 --> 04:59.398
More like mongolian barf.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.533
Really?

05:01.535 --> 05:03.535
Not even a little courtesy
laugh on that one, huh?

05:03.537 --> 05:05.604
When you say something
that's funny, maybe.

05:05.606 --> 05:06.805
I will make you laugh, nadine.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.540
Hm? We'll see.

05:08.542 --> 05:09.841
I'll do it.
I don't know.

05:09.843 --> 05:12.311
I will do it.
I don't think so.

05:12.313 --> 05:13.812
(creaking)

05:13.814 --> 05:14.880
Mother...

05:14.882 --> 05:15.947
Yeah, what? What?
Mother!

05:15.949 --> 05:17.416
You're supposed to be awake.

05:17.418 --> 05:18.717
It's your shift.
(groans)

05:18.719 --> 05:20.686
Mother of god.

05:20.688 --> 05:22.688
I'm so tired.
I can't live like this.

05:22.690 --> 05:25.324
The door is locked.
Yeah, but if milos comes...

05:25.326 --> 05:27.392
Then I'll be too tired
to wheel away anyway.

05:34.967 --> 05:38.603
Try to get some sleep, huh?

05:38.605 --> 05:40.639
Once you get your paycheck,

05:40.641 --> 05:42.574
We'll buy the plane tickets,

05:42.576 --> 05:43.575
Start over...

05:43.577 --> 05:44.576
Okay.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.111
I was thinking beijing.

05:46.113 --> 05:48.046
I'm not going
to beijing, mother.

05:48.048 --> 05:50.482
Look, please, just let me
ask lachlan for help.

05:50.484 --> 05:51.717
No.

05:51.719 --> 05:53.385
I do not trust him.

05:55.722 --> 05:57.923
Jane:
And so, I will leave you
with these last words.

05:57.925 --> 06:00.459
"parting is such sweet sorrow

06:00.461 --> 06:03.929
That I shall say good night
till it be morrow."

06:05.598 --> 06:07.399
From <i>romeo and juliet?</i>

06:08.601 --> 06:09.868
The play we just saw?

06:09.870 --> 06:11.103
Oh.
Oh.

06:12.472 --> 06:14.373
Anyway...

06:14.375 --> 06:15.540
I thought it was appropriate

06:15.542 --> 06:16.875
Before finals week

06:16.877 --> 06:18.610
To take a moment to thank you.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.379
I have really enjoyed
getting to know

06:20.381 --> 06:21.480
Each and every one of you.

06:21.482 --> 06:22.881
And go forth

06:22.883 --> 06:25.016
And be good citizens
of the world.

06:26.152 --> 06:27.886
Okay. That's all.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.488
Victoria:
Wait.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.623
We got you a present as a class.

06:31.625 --> 06:32.958
Oh, god.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.025
Don't cry.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.093
(scoffs)
I knew she'd cry.

06:35.095 --> 06:37.963
I won't cry.

06:37.965 --> 06:41.500
Even though you're kind of
a nerd who thinks it's okay

06:41.502 --> 06:43.435
To wear "sensible shoes,"

06:43.437 --> 06:44.936
The truth is,

06:44.938 --> 06:47.439
We really think
you're a great teacher.

06:47.441 --> 06:48.607
So, here.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.510
Don't cry.

06:51.512 --> 06:52.911
I won't.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.980
(chuckles)

06:56.649 --> 06:58.850
It's, like, for the baby.

06:59.952 --> 07:01.553
Okay,

07:01.555 --> 07:02.654
You should get off the bus.

07:02.656 --> 07:03.722
Mm-hmm... (clear throat)

07:03.724 --> 07:05.424
Yeah.

07:05.426 --> 07:06.691
(phone rings)

07:06.693 --> 07:09.194
Hello?

07:09.196 --> 07:11.062
Ms. Villanueva,
this is sister margaret.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.564
Oh, oh, is this about the gift?

07:12.566 --> 07:14.199
Because if I'm not allowed
to accept gifts,

07:14.201 --> 07:15.967
I will return it immediately.
(chuckles) no, no.

07:15.969 --> 07:18.970
This is because I'd like
to offer you a permanent job.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.205
What?

07:20.207 --> 07:22.674
Another teacher is pregnant.

07:22.676 --> 07:25.610
We thought you could trail her
until you graduate

07:25.612 --> 07:27.546
And then cover
her maternity leave.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.681
Then when she comes back,
you can take yours

07:29.683 --> 07:31.082
With the promise

07:31.084 --> 07:33.552
Of a permanent position
in our middle school

07:33.554 --> 07:37.889
Wait, is-is this
about the jane the virgin coins?

07:37.891 --> 07:39.691
No, ms. Villanueva.

07:39.693 --> 07:42.227
This is because
the students gave you

07:42.229 --> 07:45.096
The highest score
on your teacher evaluations.

07:45.098 --> 07:46.465
They did?

07:46.467 --> 07:47.999
(sniffling)

07:48.001 --> 07:50.569
Are you crying, ms. Villanueva?

07:50.571 --> 07:52.037
Yes.

07:52.039 --> 07:53.638
But to be fair,

07:53.640 --> 07:55.507
It's been building up
for a while.

08:12.191 --> 08:13.792
Okay, great, cut.

08:13.794 --> 08:15.527
You can say it next time, diego.

08:15.529 --> 08:17.529
(chuckles)

08:17.531 --> 08:19.197
Santos is a priest?

08:19.199 --> 08:21.533
It's a flashback sequence.
He has since left the cloth

08:21.535 --> 08:22.868
And made love
to hundreds of women.

08:22.870 --> 08:23.869
(laughter)

08:23.871 --> 08:25.504
Okay, everyone!

08:25.506 --> 08:26.872
Jane is here;
gather round, please.

08:26.874 --> 08:28.206
Gather round. Yes.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.875
Wait, wait, what are
we gathering around for?

08:29.877 --> 08:30.876
You will see.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.210
(clears throat)
friends,

08:32.212 --> 08:34.212
Workers, as you all know,

08:34.214 --> 08:35.680
Like kanye west,

08:35.682 --> 08:37.148
I have recently acquired
a daughter.

08:37.150 --> 08:39.184
What you don't know

08:39.186 --> 08:41.620
Is that my daughter, jane,

08:41.622 --> 08:44.022
Is the new writer's intern

08:44.024 --> 08:45.757
For    <i>the passions of santo</i>yes!

08:45.759 --> 08:47.692
Yes.

08:48.661 --> 08:50.295
I don't know what to say.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.297
"thank you" is fine.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.799
It's just, I didn't ask
for the job, though.

08:54.801 --> 08:55.967
(chuckles)
you don't have to.

08:55.969 --> 08:56.968
Everybody wants to work

08:56.970 --> 08:58.537
On television.

08:58.539 --> 09:01.306
(laughter)

09:01.308 --> 09:03.808
Can I talk to you in private
for a moment?

09:03.810 --> 09:05.777
Yeah, sure. Nicolas.

09:05.779 --> 09:07.212
(whistles) everyone out!

09:07.214 --> 09:08.647
Rogelio:
See you later,

09:08.649 --> 09:10.315
My excellent teammates.

09:10.317 --> 09:13.051
Jane?
Hm?

09:13.053 --> 09:14.252
I am an actor.

09:14.254 --> 09:15.787
I am trained to read emotions,

09:15.789 --> 09:17.255
And you don't seem

09:17.257 --> 09:18.924
100% happy with the internship.

09:18.926 --> 09:21.660
Uh, I just didn't see it coming.

09:21.662 --> 09:22.928
I wanted to surprise you,
you know?

09:22.930 --> 09:24.663
And you're gonna be
done teaching in a week.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.197
No, they asked me to stay on.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.799
Oh!

09:27.801 --> 09:29.701
But don't you want
to be a writer?

09:29.703 --> 09:32.671
Yeah, I-I just never thought
about telenovelas.

09:32.673 --> 09:34.806
I mean, I don't know
if I'm gonna be any good at it.

09:34.808 --> 09:36.007
You will be good.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.609
You are my daughter.

09:37.611 --> 09:39.678
Talent courses
through your veins.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.681
(chuckles)

09:45.985 --> 09:48.954
It would be kind of cool
to try it.

09:48.956 --> 09:51.022
Don't let yourself

09:51.024 --> 09:52.824
Get swept up
by glamor, jane.

09:52.826 --> 09:54.693
I offered you
a terrific position.

09:54.695 --> 09:57.295
Just think of all the
fabulous scenes you will write.

09:57.297 --> 09:58.730
Sister margaret:
Think of all the lives

09:58.732 --> 09:59.698
You'll touch.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.266
But writing is her dream.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.034
Dreams don't pay the bills.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.737
Geez. At least her see
if she likes it.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.639
She already knows
she likes teaching.

10:07.641 --> 10:09.040
Trust me, she will like
this much, much more.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.842
No, she won't, you silly actor.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.043
Jane,

10:12.045 --> 10:13.845
What'll it be?

10:13.847 --> 10:15.280
Teaching.
Tell her, jane.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.715
Writing.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.049
Jane?
Huh?

10:18.051 --> 10:19.718
So, what do you think?

10:19.720 --> 10:21.019
Latin lover narrator:
<i>You'll recall,</i>

10:21.021 --> 10:22.854
<i>Our jane has always</i>
<i>avoided conflict.</i>

10:22.856 --> 10:25.290
I think I can do them both,
for now.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.292
Latin lover narrator:
<i>I don't want to spoil things,</i>

10:27.294 --> 10:29.361
<i>But...</i>

10:34.900 --> 10:38.003
Latin lover narrator:
It should be noted that rogelio
<i>was bursting with pride</i>

10:38.005 --> 10:39.804
<i>That jane had</i>
<i>decided to, as he put it,</i>

10:39.806 --> 10:41.139
<i>"give the family business</i>
<i>a try."</i>

10:41.141 --> 10:42.874
Dina:
Aah! You moron!

10:42.876 --> 10:44.342
Oh, no. Maybe
we should just wait.

10:44.344 --> 10:45.910
Okay. Hi.

10:45.912 --> 10:47.145
Dina, hello, hello!

10:47.147 --> 10:49.814
We are here!

10:51.751 --> 10:55.153
Jane, so nice to meet you.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.889
I will leave you to get to know
my brilliant daughter.

10:57.891 --> 10:58.890
Kisses!

10:58.892 --> 11:00.291
Mwah!

11:04.230 --> 11:06.665
So, you know,
if you need anything--

11:06.667 --> 11:08.233
Food runs, just let me know.

11:08.235 --> 11:09.901
Oh, we're actually

11:09.903 --> 11:12.437
In the middle of a story problem
for tomorrow's episode.

11:12.439 --> 11:15.674
Please stay.
Steven, recap. Go.

11:15.676 --> 11:16.975
Okay, uh, santos
has just escaped,

11:16.977 --> 11:18.943
But obviously,
he's still the president,

11:18.945 --> 11:21.680
So he needs to find a way
off the island

11:21.682 --> 11:23.314
Without being recognized.

11:23.316 --> 11:25.850
Any ideas, jane? Because
there are no bad ideas here.

11:25.852 --> 11:26.985
Ricky:
What if he makes himself

11:26.987 --> 11:29.921
A mask out of,
like, mud and twigs?

11:29.923 --> 11:31.222
Except for yours, ricky.

11:31.224 --> 11:34.325
Jane? What do you think?

11:34.327 --> 11:35.927
Headshot rogelio:
Go ahead, jane.

11:35.929 --> 11:38.396
It'll be brilliant.

11:39.465 --> 11:41.733
Um...

11:44.036 --> 11:45.103
I don't know if this is what

11:45.105 --> 11:46.905
You were looking for,

11:46.907 --> 11:48.840
But maybe santos could be
dressed as a beggar?

11:48.842 --> 11:51.376
Huh! El presidente would never
dress as a beggar!

11:51.378 --> 11:53.745
Because it would be
unexpected, see?

11:53.747 --> 11:55.847
No one would expect him
to demean himself like that.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.248
Hmm.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.917
Not bad.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.852
Let's put it in the
script and move on.

12:00.854 --> 12:03.121
Good work, jane.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.789
Latin lover narrator:
<i>It should be noted</i>

12:04.791 --> 12:06.057
<i>That at this very moment,</i>

12:06.059 --> 12:07.992
<i>Jane felt butterflies</i>
<i>in her stomach.</i>

12:07.994 --> 12:10.895
<i>And I'm not going lie.</i>

12:10.897 --> 12:12.864
<i>It felt like a sign.</i>

12:12.866 --> 12:14.399
And they're putting one of
my lines in the script.

12:14.401 --> 12:17.001
That's great!
I know! I can't
believe it.

12:17.003 --> 12:18.136
Favorite movie?
Dirty dancing.

12:18.138 --> 12:20.405
One topic not
to bring up?
Selena.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.273
Both the singer and j. Lo's
portrayal of her in the movie.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.309
Birth sign?
Come on!

12:24.311 --> 12:25.510
You seriously expect me to
remember your mom's birth sign?

12:25.512 --> 12:27.378
If it was in the e-mail,

12:27.380 --> 12:29.881
I'm gonna need you
to remember it.

12:29.883 --> 12:32.283
I know. I'm sorry.
I'm so stressed.

12:32.285 --> 12:34.385
I just really want
this to go well.

12:34.387 --> 12:35.386
I know, and it will.

12:35.388 --> 12:37.388
Parents love me.

12:37.390 --> 12:40.024
Mm-hmm.
I rarely curse, and I have
excellent table manners.

12:40.026 --> 12:41.392
Hmm.

12:41.394 --> 12:42.961
Mm...

12:44.864 --> 12:46.297
You seem tired.

12:46.299 --> 12:48.466
Maybe you should
slow down.

12:48.468 --> 12:50.401
No, I'm fine.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.403
All this running around
between waitressing

12:52.405 --> 12:55.173
And teaching,
and now the telenovela...

12:55.175 --> 12:57.308
You can't keep this up forever.

12:57.310 --> 13:00.478
You got to make a decision
before it catches up with you.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.313
And our peach.

13:02.315 --> 13:05.283
According to baby center,
it is now an apple,

13:05.285 --> 13:06.551
Rounding the corner
to avocado.

13:06.553 --> 13:09.420
Both:
Mmm.

13:09.422 --> 13:10.922
Uh-uh.
Let's not lose focus.

13:10.924 --> 13:12.423
Come on, we're in
the home stretch.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.559
Look, what's my grandma's
favorite tv show?

13:14.561 --> 13:17.095
<i>Sabado gigante.</i>
<i>Xiomara:</i>
<i>I'm just saying that</i>

13:17.097 --> 13:19.531
If we cancel with rafael, you'll
get to watch <i>sabado gigante.</i>

13:26.572 --> 13:29.841
(phone buzzing,
xiomara sighs)
ah.

13:36.448 --> 13:38.049
Because he wants
to make dinner plans,

13:38.051 --> 13:39.851
And I don't want to see him.

13:39.853 --> 13:41.452
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Well, that's not exactly true.</i>

13:41.454 --> 13:42.921
<i>Xo really,</i> really
<i>wanted to see him.</i>

13:44.590 --> 13:47.926
I made a promise to god, okay?

13:47.928 --> 13:50.128
When you were hurt
in the hospital.

13:50.130 --> 13:51.863
Latin lover narrator: <i>Of course,</i>
<i>alba knew this already.</i>

13:51.865 --> 13:54.465
I promise
if you take care of ma,

13:54.467 --> 13:58.002
I won't let a man between
these legs again without a ring.

13:58.004 --> 13:58.970
Latin lover narrator:
<i>But xo didn't know</i>
<i>alba knew that.</i>

14:04.076 --> 14:06.578
I know, I know-- that's why
I've been avoiding rogelio.

14:11.417 --> 14:13.084
Mm.
(door opens)

14:13.086 --> 14:15.353
Jane:
We're here.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.490
Don't worry.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.960
Latin lover narrator:
<i>But alba was worried.</i>

14:21.962 --> 14:24.896
<i>But, thanks to jane's</i>
<i>careful preparation,</i>

14:24.898 --> 14:27.565
<i>Rafael was performing</i>
<i>brilliantly at dinner.</i>

14:27.567 --> 14:29.234
As I was saying, I believe

14:29.236 --> 14:31.302
That hard work
is the key to success.

14:31.304 --> 14:32.570
I mean, as a taurus,

14:32.572 --> 14:34.239
You must know what I mean.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.407
Persistence
is everything.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.042
Hmm.

14:45.985 --> 14:47.252
Xiomara:
You look tired, hon.

14:47.254 --> 14:50.555
Are you leaning more towards
teaching or interning?

14:50.557 --> 14:52.257
I don't know.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.925
I'm going back and forth.

14:57.129 --> 14:59.397
Ma, don't pressure her.

15:01.267 --> 15:03.001
I know.
Xiomara:
But, hon,

15:03.003 --> 15:05.536
You want to be a writer.
You said you got butterflies.

15:05.538 --> 15:07.672
Ma, if she doesn't
chase down her dream,

15:07.674 --> 15:09.540
She'll always regret it.

15:09.542 --> 15:10.942
I totally agree.

15:12.011 --> 15:15.546
Anyway,

15:15.548 --> 15:16.614
I have time to sort
it out, so...

15:16.616 --> 15:18.149
Your mom is right.

15:18.151 --> 15:19.684
Life is short.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.352
We spend all our time working.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.288
It should be spent
doing something that you love.

15:23.290 --> 15:26.691
Besides, all the other stuff--
the baby and the bills--

15:26.693 --> 15:30.194
You know I'll take
care of that.

15:30.196 --> 15:32.597
What do you mean,
you'll take care of it?

15:32.599 --> 15:35.300
Oh, I was... I was just
agreeing with you,

15:35.302 --> 15:36.567
That she should
take the internship,

15:36.569 --> 15:38.937
And she shouldn't make
a decision about money.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.171
Because...

15:40.173 --> 15:41.439
I can help out there.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.174
Latin lover narrator:
<i>To be fair,</i>

15:43.176 --> 15:45.576
<i>Jane had not told rafael</i>
<i>not to offer any money.</i>

15:45.578 --> 15:47.078
<i>But only because</i>
<i>she never thought</i>

15:47.080 --> 15:48.713
<i>He'd do something so stupid.</i>

15:48.715 --> 15:51.049
I don't think
jane's asking for your help.

15:51.051 --> 15:53.718
Uh, yeah, I-I know that.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.253
And I know she's not
gonna take your money.

15:55.255 --> 15:56.587
Mom, just calm down.

15:56.589 --> 15:58.389
I am calm.
I just don't like the idea

15:58.391 --> 16:00.058
That he thinks
we'll take handouts.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.125
That's not what I meant.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.493
We work hard, all of us do.

16:02.495 --> 16:03.594
I understand that,
but I'm still going

16:03.596 --> 16:05.129
To take care of
the baby financially.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.198
Good. You should.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.666
And if jane needs anything...

16:08.668 --> 16:10.468
Her family will
take care of her.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.636
And we are going to be family.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.271
I'm the father of her baby.

16:13.273 --> 16:14.339
Not on purpose.

16:30.389 --> 16:31.656
(clears throat)

16:31.658 --> 16:33.291
Okay, he's gone.

16:33.293 --> 16:35.126
What was all
that about?

16:35.128 --> 16:36.761
I could ask you
the same thing.

16:36.763 --> 16:39.364
You guys were actually agreeing.

16:39.366 --> 16:40.698
You both want me
to make a decision.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.633
And that's your decision?

16:42.635 --> 16:44.302
To let him pay for everything?

16:44.304 --> 16:45.703
No, of course not.

16:45.705 --> 16:47.638
I mean, if I decide
to take the internship,

16:47.640 --> 16:49.374
I'm gonna keep waitressing.

16:49.376 --> 16:50.641
I'm not afraid of hard work,
you know that.

16:50.643 --> 16:51.709
Rafael doesn't.

16:51.711 --> 16:53.177
Stop, mom.

16:53.179 --> 16:56.180
He was trying
to be supportive.

16:56.182 --> 16:59.250
And yeah, he said
something... Stupid,

16:59.252 --> 17:01.686
But instead of letting
it go, you drilled down.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.788
I mean, what is wrong with you?
Why won't you give him a chance?

17:03.790 --> 17:05.323
You know why.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.724
I just don't see
you guys together.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.659
Because you're not trying.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.528
Why can't you at least try?

17:12.064 --> 17:13.664
You still love her, don't you?

17:13.666 --> 17:15.733
We belong together.

17:15.735 --> 17:17.802
And I'll never stop
believing that.

17:17.804 --> 17:18.803
Jane:
<i>Mom?</i>

17:18.805 --> 17:20.738
What is it?

17:23.442 --> 17:27.145
I-it just feels like
being disloyal to michael.

17:27.147 --> 17:28.746
What?

17:28.748 --> 17:29.814
You were with him

17:29.816 --> 17:31.082
Two years.

17:31.084 --> 17:32.750
Yeah.

17:32.752 --> 17:35.686
But... I've moved on

17:35.688 --> 17:37.288
And he's moved on.

17:37.290 --> 17:38.823
No, he hasn't.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.725
What are you talking about?

17:40.727 --> 17:43.428
Nothing, it doesn't matter.

17:43.430 --> 17:45.463
The point is that

17:45.465 --> 17:47.732
Michael was like part of
the family for a long time.

17:47.734 --> 17:51.102
And I get that everything
has changed for you, but...

17:51.104 --> 17:53.805
You gotta give me a second
to catch up.

17:56.475 --> 17:57.775
I get it.

17:59.111 --> 18:00.711
But that doesn't mean

18:00.713 --> 18:02.613
That you can be rude to rafael.

18:02.615 --> 18:05.116
You're right.

18:05.118 --> 18:07.652
I'll apologize tomorrow.

18:12.458 --> 18:14.859
Lachlan:
She lives!

18:22.734 --> 18:24.735
I came in yesterday.
I called you a couple of times.

18:24.737 --> 18:26.137
Yeah, I'm sorry,
I've-I've been...

18:26.139 --> 18:27.872
A little under the weather.

18:27.874 --> 18:30.274
I'm in a hurry, actually.
Wait, wait.
Where are you going?

18:30.276 --> 18:32.243
Picking up my check.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop, stop.

18:32.245 --> 18:33.711
Petra, what's...
What's going on?

18:35.414 --> 18:37.815
Please, tell me.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.786
Okay, so this guy, ivan,

18:41.788 --> 18:43.254
He's been blackmailing you?

18:43.256 --> 18:44.755
Exactly.

18:44.757 --> 18:46.390
And when he learned
that we wouldn't be able

18:46.392 --> 18:48.493
To pay him any longer...

18:48.495 --> 18:50.761
Well, we, uh...

18:50.763 --> 18:52.296
We had a misunderstanding.

18:52.298 --> 18:53.564
Latin lover narrator:
<i>To be clear:</i>

18:53.566 --> 18:54.799
<i>She took him hostage.</i>

18:54.801 --> 18:56.367
<i>He escaped.</i>

18:56.369 --> 18:57.768
And I'm scared he'll
tell milos where I am.

18:57.770 --> 19:00.371
I know... I know this
all sounds crazy.

19:00.373 --> 19:01.639
It is crazy.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.908
I feel crazy.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.510
Cooped up in
my room, scared,

19:05.512 --> 19:07.512
Just waiting for yellow
tulips to arrive...

19:07.514 --> 19:09.313
Tulips?

19:09.315 --> 19:11.582
Yeah.

19:11.584 --> 19:12.783
Milos used to
send me them

19:12.785 --> 19:14.418
Before he'd come
home from a trip.

19:14.420 --> 19:16.821
It was kind of
his calling card.

19:16.823 --> 19:20.191
That's why I've
been hiding out.

19:20.193 --> 19:22.160
And that's why
I have to leave.

19:22.162 --> 19:24.829
Let me come with you.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.831
What?
Listen to me.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.399
The maracay hotel group has
properties all over the world.

19:28.401 --> 19:29.700
I can ask to be transferred.

19:29.702 --> 19:30.935
Why?

19:32.571 --> 19:34.805
Petra, come on.

19:34.807 --> 19:37.275
You know how I feel about you.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.410
Okay, look,

19:39.412 --> 19:40.845
It's gonna take me
a couple of days

19:40.847 --> 19:42.613
To work out the arrangements.
In the meantime,

19:42.615 --> 19:44.715
I'm gonna have you moved up
to one of our penthouses.

19:44.717 --> 19:46.551
They have state-of-the-art
high-tech security systems,

19:46.553 --> 19:48.219
So you're gonna
be safe, okay?

19:48.221 --> 19:49.453
Look at me.

19:49.455 --> 19:50.888
I promise you.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.267
(knocking at door)

20:05.237 --> 20:07.471
Is this a bad time?

20:07.473 --> 20:09.207
Uh... No.

20:09.209 --> 20:11.642
No, uh, come in.

20:12.978 --> 20:14.912
Wow.

20:14.914 --> 20:17.448
Incredible view.

20:17.450 --> 20:19.917
Yeah. It was kind of
a selling point of the place.

20:21.787 --> 20:23.854
Uh, do you want to...
Do you want to sit?

20:23.856 --> 20:25.256
Yeah, sure.

20:25.258 --> 20:26.557
Let's sit.

20:33.932 --> 20:37.335
I just wanted to apologize.

20:37.337 --> 20:39.270
I was really rude last night.

20:39.272 --> 20:41.272
I overreacted and I'm sorry.

20:42.774 --> 20:44.408
I'm sorry, too.

20:44.410 --> 20:46.010
Things just escalated.

20:46.012 --> 20:47.745
Exactly.
You know, but
I have to say,

20:47.747 --> 20:51.015
It doesn't seem like
you like me very much.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.683
Latin lover narrator:
<i>She doesn't.</i>
<i>Let's just be honest.</i>

20:52.685 --> 20:54.485
So we can get to the root of it.

20:54.487 --> 20:55.920
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Never a good idea.</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

20:55.922 --> 20:57.755
Latin lover narrator:
<i>I wouldn't say it.</i>

20:57.757 --> 20:58.889
I just don't think
you're right for jane.

20:58.891 --> 20:59.624
Why?

20:59.626 --> 21:01.359
It's just...

21:01.361 --> 21:03.361
A character thing, if you
really want to know the truth.

21:03.363 --> 21:06.030
You don't know my character.
I know

21:06.032 --> 21:07.431
You kissed her and you didn't

21:07.433 --> 21:08.699
Call her back
and she was crushed.

21:08.701 --> 21:09.700
That was five years ago!

21:09.702 --> 21:10.768
Still speaks to character.

21:10.770 --> 21:11.902
You're not being fair, okay?

21:11.904 --> 21:12.970
People change.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.272
Not fundamentally.

21:14.274 --> 21:15.506
And you guys are different

21:15.508 --> 21:16.507
In every regard.

21:16.509 --> 21:17.541
You see the world differently

21:17.543 --> 21:18.843
I'm sorry, but you have

21:18.845 --> 21:20.578
No idea how I see the world.

21:20.580 --> 21:21.912
Maybe not.

21:21.914 --> 21:25.283
But I know that you see it
from up here.

21:25.285 --> 21:28.386
With this incredible view.

21:28.388 --> 21:30.621
(phone whooshes, buzzes)

21:32.057 --> 21:35.393
I have to go.

21:35.395 --> 21:37.561
No problem.
Uh...

21:37.563 --> 21:38.863
Let's just... Can we...?

21:38.865 --> 21:40.031
Can we talk about this later?

21:47.939 --> 21:50.007
El presidente, uh...

21:54.746 --> 21:56.814
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Note that jane had hurried</i>
<i>to the stage</i>

21:56.816 --> 21:58.816
<i>So she could watch them</i>
<i>film the scene idea</i>

21:58.818 --> 22:00.084
<i>She had come up with.</i>

22:00.086 --> 22:02.086
<i>Santos disguised</i>

22:02.088 --> 22:03.788
<i>As a beggar.</i>

22:05.557 --> 22:06.957
<i>A pirate beggar?</i>

22:06.959 --> 22:09.026
<i>That's weird.</i>

22:15.100 --> 22:18.736
<i>And jane realized exactly</i>
<i>what had happened.</i>

22:18.738 --> 22:21.839
Did you tell the writers
to act like they liked my idea?

22:21.841 --> 22:23.974
Uh... Are you
enjoying your new job?

22:23.976 --> 22:25.710
Rogelio, did you?

22:27.979 --> 22:29.480
Yes, I did.

22:29.482 --> 22:31.916
But it was to give
you confidence.

22:31.918 --> 22:33.918
You said you didn't know if
you'd be any good at writing.

22:33.920 --> 22:36.520
And believing in yourself
is the hardest part.

22:36.522 --> 22:38.756
I get that,
and-and that's sweet.

22:38.758 --> 22:40.391
But I have

22:40.393 --> 22:43.661
This big life choice to make
between teaching and writing.

22:43.663 --> 22:47.131
And I'm just really trying
to figure out if I have talent

22:47.133 --> 22:49.600
Because that matters.

22:49.602 --> 22:51.602
Say no more.

22:51.604 --> 22:53.037
I completely understand.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.905
Thank you.

22:54.907 --> 22:57.074
So, write me a scene.

22:57.076 --> 22:58.609
What?

22:58.611 --> 23:00.611
I can tell you
if you have talent.

23:00.613 --> 23:02.913
I don't usually read
unsolicited manuscripts,

23:02.915 --> 23:05.082
But since your my daughter,
I'm gonna make an exception.

23:05.084 --> 23:07.785
(quiet laugh)

23:07.787 --> 23:10.020
So, theses are the plans?
Yeah.

23:10.022 --> 23:12.890
Signed by me, signed by
your dad. What's this about?

23:12.892 --> 23:14.158
It's about the fact
that there was a tunnel

23:14.160 --> 23:15.760
Found inside the hotel leading

23:15.762 --> 23:17.161
From here in the recovery suites

23:17.163 --> 23:19.163
To here... Under the hotel.

23:19.165 --> 23:20.698
What?

23:20.700 --> 23:22.500
You had nothing to do with it?

23:22.502 --> 23:23.968
No! This is news to me.

23:23.970 --> 23:25.436
All right.

23:25.438 --> 23:27.505
Look at those bathrooms.

23:27.507 --> 23:29.039
Is that your work?

23:29.041 --> 23:30.541
Yeah.

23:30.543 --> 23:32.910
Well, not this one. No.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.945
See how the tiling there is
just... A little different.

23:34.947 --> 23:37.047
Maybe a subcontractor.
Who?

23:37.049 --> 23:38.516
Don't know.

23:38.518 --> 23:40.117
Your dad could've hired anyone.

23:41.653 --> 23:43.721
Hey.

23:47.192 --> 23:49.693
I know who did that
other bathroom.

23:49.695 --> 23:51.061
And for a small fee,

23:51.063 --> 23:54.031
I'd be happy to give you
his name and address.

23:56.668 --> 23:58.736
So, I hear you're

23:58.738 --> 24:02.473
Writing a scene.

24:02.475 --> 24:04.475
Yup. About a pirate.
Just not quite sure

24:04.477 --> 24:07.077
How to not make it sound...
Ridiculous.

24:07.079 --> 24:09.213
Oh, you just got to find
something you relate to.

24:09.215 --> 24:11.582
At least that's
what I tell myself.

24:11.584 --> 24:13.584
Oh, you're a writer, too?
An actor.

24:13.586 --> 24:15.219
You know, your dad,
he's been, uh,

24:15.221 --> 24:17.688
He's been
really helpful, actually.

24:17.690 --> 24:18.722
Haven't booked
anything yet, but...

24:18.724 --> 24:20.124
I'm sure you will.

24:20.126 --> 24:21.559
Yeah. I hope so.

24:21.561 --> 24:22.960
Anyway...

24:22.962 --> 24:24.228
You have to find a way

24:24.230 --> 24:26.130
To empathize with
your character.

24:26.132 --> 24:29.099
Relate to the pirate.

24:29.101 --> 24:31.235
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And so, jane tried her best</i>

24:31.237 --> 24:33.838
<i>To relate to the pirate.</i>

24:33.840 --> 24:37.007
<i>But that turned out</i>
<i>to be ridiculous advice.</i>

24:37.009 --> 24:39.910
<i>However, jane did manage</i>

24:39.912 --> 24:41.779
<i>To write</i>
<i>a pretty cute scene anyway,</i>

24:41.781 --> 24:45.149
<i>In my entirely</i>
<i>unbiased opinion.</i>

24:45.151 --> 24:46.784
<i>And as she wrote,</i>

24:46.786 --> 24:49.520
<i>The butterflies returned.</i>

24:53.592 --> 24:56.861
<i>And speaking of butterflies...</i>

24:56.863 --> 24:59.530
(doorbell rings)

25:15.881 --> 25:18.516
I've never seen you so...

25:18.518 --> 25:19.950
Casual. Yeah.

25:19.952 --> 25:21.886
I'm keeping it casual tonight.

25:21.888 --> 25:24.021
Interesting.

25:24.023 --> 25:25.289
You know, I'm not usually a fan

25:25.291 --> 25:27.558
Of the whole
"less is more" thing.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.760
But looking at you right now?

25:29.762 --> 25:31.295
Less is just...

25:31.297 --> 25:32.897
<i>Estimulante.</i>

25:32.899 --> 25:34.031
Right, so I thought

25:34.033 --> 25:35.533
Maybe we could order pizza?

25:35.535 --> 25:36.767
Great.

25:36.769 --> 25:38.903
And after maybe
we can make love.

25:38.905 --> 25:40.971
Let's start with a pizza.

25:42.641 --> 25:45.776
Wow. That's a lot of garlic
you're putting on there.

25:45.778 --> 25:47.211
I just love garlic.
Me, too.

25:47.213 --> 25:48.979
You know, it's funny.
Some people don't like

25:48.981 --> 25:50.047
To kiss after garlic.

25:50.049 --> 25:52.049
I don't have that problem.

25:52.051 --> 25:54.652
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Working up the courage</i>
<i>to tell rogelio</i>

25:54.654 --> 25:57.588
<i>About her vow of chastity</i>
<i>was proving harder</i>

25:57.590 --> 26:00.257
<i>Than xiomara had anticipated.</i>

26:00.259 --> 26:01.559
<i>Yes, more wine.</i>

26:01.561 --> 26:03.193
<i>That will help.</i>

26:03.195 --> 26:04.328
Let me grab another bottle.

26:04.330 --> 26:06.330
So, listen, I did want

26:06.332 --> 26:08.198
To talk to you about something.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.968
Do you remember
when we first met, xiomara?

26:10.970 --> 26:12.836
Yeah. In biology class.

26:12.838 --> 26:14.838
You kept making
those dumb jokes.

26:14.840 --> 26:17.675
You laughed at
those dumb jokes.

26:17.677 --> 26:19.710
Yeah, I did.

26:19.712 --> 26:22.279
You look exactly
the same, xiomara.

26:22.281 --> 26:24.248
I mean it.

26:24.250 --> 26:26.216
I look at you tonight
and it's like

26:26.218 --> 26:28.652
No time has passed.

26:46.171 --> 26:47.037
Oh!

26:47.039 --> 26:49.306
Oh, me, too.

26:49.308 --> 26:51.041
(both scream)

26:51.043 --> 26:52.843
You have to go!

26:52.845 --> 26:54.111
Why? Why? Why? <i>Â¿que paso?</i>

26:54.113 --> 26:56.113
<i>Â¿que?</i>
<i>Oh, my god...</i>

26:56.115 --> 26:58.649
<i>Â¿que paso? Que?</i>
<i>Go.</i>

27:07.258 --> 27:09.627
Yeah, but I didn't
tell him the reason, ma.

27:09.629 --> 27:11.395
I just freaked out.

27:14.132 --> 27:16.767
Because I really like him.

27:16.769 --> 27:19.003
And once he finds out

27:19.005 --> 27:22.773
That, you know...
My charms are off-limits...

27:22.775 --> 27:26.710
I don't know
if he'll be interested.

27:30.815 --> 27:33.684
I thought you loved rogelio.

27:48.299 --> 27:50.434
I can't thank you enough.

27:50.436 --> 27:52.302
I finally feel safe.

27:52.304 --> 27:53.904
You should.

27:53.906 --> 27:56.240
No one gets on this
floor unnoticed.

27:56.242 --> 27:58.676
The windows are too big in here.
Mother!

27:58.678 --> 28:01.245
Draw the blinds, magda.

28:01.247 --> 28:03.113
All right.

28:03.115 --> 28:06.784
Call me if you need anything.

28:06.786 --> 28:08.452
Don't be rude, mother.

28:08.454 --> 28:11.188
He's the only person
who's helping us.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.257
And I still don't trust him.

28:13.259 --> 28:14.925
Well, I do. And...

28:14.927 --> 28:17.327
You're my mother, so you
just have to get on board.

28:17.329 --> 28:19.229
Rogelio:
<i>I am on board.</i>

28:19.231 --> 28:22.466
"I am completely on board."

28:22.468 --> 28:24.468
Ah!

28:24.470 --> 28:25.469
Oh, I see.

28:25.471 --> 28:27.104
You brought that theme back.

28:27.106 --> 28:28.739
Plus, you know, it's,
like, a play on words.

28:28.741 --> 28:30.107
Because you're
"on board" the ship.

28:30.109 --> 28:32.476
Ah! Clever.

28:32.478 --> 28:35.012
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Truth be told,</i>
<i>this was the first time</i>

28:35.014 --> 28:37.948
<i>In jane's life that she had</i>
<i>sought her father's approval.</i>

28:37.950 --> 28:39.416
All right, I'm finished.

28:39.418 --> 28:42.252
<i>And she wanted it very badly.</i>

28:42.254 --> 28:44.855
I don't like it.
What?

28:44.857 --> 28:46.156
Well, I'm sorry.

28:46.158 --> 28:48.158
You asked me to be honest.

28:48.160 --> 28:49.359
You said it was important.

28:49.361 --> 28:53.430
It is, but what did you
not like about it exactly?

28:53.432 --> 28:56.033
Well, a pirate would
never say these things.

28:56.035 --> 28:58.302
Oh, okay. I mean, do you know
a lot of pirates or...?

28:58.304 --> 29:00.437
And second and
most importantly,

29:00.439 --> 29:02.106
Telenovelas are
all about drama.

29:02.108 --> 29:04.241
You know-- yelling,
crying, scheming.

29:04.243 --> 29:06.477
And there's none
of that in here.

29:07.512 --> 29:08.779
I'm sorry. Are you angry?

29:08.781 --> 29:10.247
No.

29:10.249 --> 29:11.415
I mean...

29:11.417 --> 29:14.184
It stings, but...

29:14.186 --> 29:15.519
I wanted you
to tell me the truth.

29:15.521 --> 29:17.387
I have to make a decision.

29:17.389 --> 29:19.389
I just really loved writing it.

29:19.391 --> 29:21.391
I-I mean, I got butterflies.

29:21.393 --> 29:22.426
Well, that is important.

29:22.428 --> 29:23.927
You know, passion is important.

29:23.929 --> 29:25.529
Yeah, but if I'm not talented...
Oh, stop.

29:25.531 --> 29:27.898
Every new skill takes time.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.833
You can't expect to be
an expert overnight.

29:32.537 --> 29:35.405
Hey. You sound tired.

29:35.407 --> 29:36.406
(yawning):
I'm not.

29:36.408 --> 29:37.541
Jane, come on.

29:37.543 --> 29:39.009
You can't keep up this schedule.

29:39.011 --> 29:41.278
I know. I'm trying
to figure it out.

29:41.280 --> 29:44.414
Did my mom ever apologize
to you, by the way?

29:44.416 --> 29:46.150
(stammers)
kind of.

29:46.152 --> 29:47.217
(jane groans)

29:47.219 --> 29:48.418
No.
It's fine.

29:48.420 --> 29:50.821
It's a process.
We'll get there.

29:50.823 --> 29:53.157
No, I just hate it when people
in my life don't get along.

29:53.159 --> 29:55.425
It just makes me all anxious.

29:55.427 --> 29:56.560
Anxious? Why?

29:56.562 --> 29:59.096
I don't know.

29:59.098 --> 30:00.798
My mom and my grandma
fought a lot growing up.

30:00.800 --> 30:03.066
And I just always
wanted to fix things.

30:03.068 --> 30:04.434
I get that.

30:04.436 --> 30:06.570
But some things just take time.

30:06.572 --> 30:09.439
Yeah. Giving things time
is not my strong suit.

30:09.441 --> 30:11.508
Well, then you got to try, huh?

30:11.510 --> 30:13.477
And don't worry,
we will get there.

30:13.479 --> 30:14.578
We have to.

30:14.580 --> 30:17.581
Because I am not going anywhere.

30:17.583 --> 30:19.850
Oh, that's so sweet.

30:19.852 --> 30:22.486
Can you say that again
for my mom?

30:22.488 --> 30:24.488
(laughs)
look, I'm gonna go.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.190
Just text me
when you get home, okay?

30:26.192 --> 30:27.457
Okay.

30:27.459 --> 30:28.458
Bye.

30:28.460 --> 30:30.994
All right. Bye.

30:30.996 --> 30:32.996
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Truth be told,</i>

30:32.998 --> 30:34.464
<i>Part of the reason</i>

30:34.466 --> 30:36.934
<i>Rafael's problems with xiomara</i>
<i>didn't phase him</i>

30:36.936 --> 30:38.602
<i>Were that they seemed</i>
<i>slightly insignificant</i>

30:38.604 --> 30:40.337
<i>Compared to the fact</i>

30:40.339 --> 30:42.472
<i>That his father could be</i>
<i>sin rostro.</i>

30:42.474 --> 30:43.507
Can I help you?

30:43.509 --> 30:45.342
Yeah, I, uh,

30:45.344 --> 30:47.144
I know you were hired to do

30:47.146 --> 30:48.545
The bathroom work
at the marbella.

30:48.547 --> 30:50.514
(laughs):
Who the hell are you?

30:50.516 --> 30:52.883
Just hoping that maybe if you
could tell me who hired you,

30:52.885 --> 30:55.886
I could... Make it
worth your while.

30:55.888 --> 30:57.487
(laughs)

30:57.489 --> 30:59.890
(camera shutter clicking)

31:01.626 --> 31:04.895
I'm only gonna
say this once.

31:05.630 --> 31:09.199
Get the hell off
my property.

31:16.541 --> 31:18.542
Someone was just here,
asking questions.

31:18.544 --> 31:20.310
Call me back.

31:24.983 --> 31:27.050
(passing car honking horn)

31:39.564 --> 31:41.531
(car honks horn)

31:41.533 --> 31:44.001
(groans)

31:48.006 --> 31:49.439
Who the hell are you?

31:49.441 --> 31:51.909
Oh, I'm looking for andy.

31:51.911 --> 31:52.943
Are you with
that other guy?

31:52.945 --> 31:54.611
Wha...?

31:55.580 --> 31:57.381
(thuds)

32:04.088 --> 32:05.956
It was just a little
fender bender.

32:05.958 --> 32:09.326
But my mom freaked out.
Because you're pregnant.

32:09.328 --> 32:11.328
Of course you
needed to come.

32:11.330 --> 32:14.197
(heart beating over monitor)
doctor: The heartbeat, good.

32:14.199 --> 32:15.599
That's a good sign.

32:15.601 --> 32:17.200
You see? I told you.

32:17.202 --> 32:18.635
Jane, I want to
tell you something,

32:18.637 --> 32:20.103
And I am serious
about it.

32:20.105 --> 32:21.338
Oh, maybe not now.

32:21.340 --> 32:22.472
No, now.

32:22.474 --> 32:24.274
You are taking
on too much.

32:24.276 --> 32:27.477
Between waitressing and teaching
and now this internship,

32:27.479 --> 32:29.479
It's too much--
you can't do it all.

32:29.481 --> 32:30.948
You gotta make a choice.

32:32.383 --> 32:35.152
I completely agree.

32:37.622 --> 32:40.624
Hey, look at
you two-- friends.

32:40.626 --> 32:42.392
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And just then,</i>

32:42.394 --> 32:45.128
<i>The butterflies came back.</i>

32:45.130 --> 32:47.097
Do you feel the baby kicking?

32:47.099 --> 32:48.665
What? No, not yet.

32:48.667 --> 32:50.500
It's happening now.

32:50.502 --> 32:53.036
(gasps)
sometimes it's hard
to tell at first,

32:53.038 --> 32:54.738
But my wife said it felt like
butterflies in her stomach.

32:56.674 --> 32:59.676
That's the baby kicking?

32:59.678 --> 33:01.678
I feel it.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.380
Rafael: Wait, uh,
where, where?

33:03.382 --> 33:05.449
My turn, my turn.

33:07.652 --> 33:10.053
What were you doing
following rafael?

33:10.055 --> 33:12.689
I know he's involved.
And you were told
specifically to back off.

33:12.691 --> 33:14.424
But, nadine, right before
I went in, there was a guy

33:14.426 --> 33:16.593
Making a call-- I wrote down the
number, and guess who picked up.

33:16.595 --> 33:18.261
Plastic surgeon.

33:18.263 --> 33:20.063
It's got to be the one
working with sin rostro.

33:20.065 --> 33:21.465
Redoing the faces.

33:21.467 --> 33:23.066
I am on to something here,
you gotta believe me.

33:23.068 --> 33:24.401
It's not enough
to believe you,

33:24.403 --> 33:26.003
I'm also gonna have
to lie for you.

33:26.005 --> 33:28.005
Armstrong called.

33:28.007 --> 33:29.606
(groans)
he wanted to know
what happened to you.

33:29.608 --> 33:31.141
Can't you just say
you don't know?

33:31.143 --> 33:32.409
But I do know.

33:32.411 --> 33:35.012
Just tell me that this
isn't about jane,

33:35.014 --> 33:37.414
That you're not spiraling
because of jane.

33:37.416 --> 33:38.615
It's not about jane.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.083
I promise you.

33:42.086 --> 33:44.021
Okay. Okay.

33:44.023 --> 33:46.423
Xiomara, how's jane?

33:46.425 --> 33:48.325
She's fine, the baby's fine,
everything's fine.

33:48.327 --> 33:50.427
Thank god.

33:50.429 --> 33:52.596
Xiomara, what is it?

33:52.598 --> 33:55.032
First last night,
and now as we hug.

33:55.034 --> 33:57.034
Why are you so afraid to
have your pelvis touch mine?

33:59.037 --> 34:01.038
Here's the thing:

34:01.040 --> 34:02.506
I took a vow
of chastity.

34:02.508 --> 34:04.474
What?!
Yeah.

34:04.476 --> 34:08.111
I-I'm gonna give it a try.
(anxious laugh)

34:08.113 --> 34:11.114
And, well, anyway,
I-I just wanted you to know.

34:11.116 --> 34:13.116
And I don't expect you
to stick around, okay?

34:13.118 --> 34:16.053
Because this is my thing.

34:16.055 --> 34:17.487
Of course I'll
stick around.

34:17.489 --> 34:20.190
You are worth waiting for.

34:21.526 --> 34:23.527
Any idea,

34:23.529 --> 34:26.463
Like, you know, on
a rough timeframe?

34:27.465 --> 34:28.532
I'll keep you posted.

34:47.151 --> 34:48.285
(gasps)

34:48.287 --> 34:49.352
Tulips?

34:49.354 --> 34:51.154
Milos used to send me them

34:51.156 --> 34:52.522
Before he'd come
home from a trip.

34:52.524 --> 34:53.824
It was kind of
his calling card.

34:56.761 --> 34:59.129
(cell phone buzzes)

34:59.131 --> 35:01.131
Hello?

35:01.133 --> 35:04.234
Yes, this is she.

35:04.236 --> 35:07.637
What kind of...?

35:07.639 --> 35:10.640
Okay, thank you.

35:10.642 --> 35:12.642
Is everything okay?

35:12.644 --> 35:14.544
It's michael.

35:14.546 --> 35:17.547
(knocking on door)

35:17.549 --> 35:19.649
Jane.

35:19.651 --> 35:20.684
What are you doing here?

35:20.686 --> 35:23.520
I'm still your
emergency contact.

35:23.522 --> 35:24.521
I guess.
(chuckles)

35:24.523 --> 35:26.123
And I was here, too, so...

35:26.125 --> 35:27.157
Is everything okay?

35:27.159 --> 35:29.659
Yes, it was just a car accident.

35:29.661 --> 35:31.328
What?!
A minor one.

35:31.330 --> 35:33.663
It was nothing, really.

35:33.665 --> 35:35.332
You're okay? The baby's okay?

35:35.334 --> 35:36.333
Yeah. Yeah,
we're okay.

35:36.335 --> 35:37.334
Good.

35:37.336 --> 35:38.401
What happened to you?

35:38.403 --> 35:40.570
Bruised ribs.

35:40.572 --> 35:42.439
Small concussion.

35:42.441 --> 35:44.741
Occupational hazard.

35:46.744 --> 35:47.811
What?

35:47.813 --> 35:49.412
I don't know.

35:49.414 --> 35:50.580
This.

35:50.582 --> 35:53.683
Seems kind of like
a sign, you know?

35:53.685 --> 35:55.285
You and me in the same hospital.

35:55.287 --> 35:57.721
At the same time.

35:57.723 --> 36:00.357
Latin lover narrator: <i>It felt</i>
<i>like a sign to jane as well.</i>

36:00.359 --> 36:02.359
<i>Only, a different one.</i>

36:02.361 --> 36:06.630
Michael, you're not waiting
for me, are you?

36:06.632 --> 36:08.198
For us?

36:08.200 --> 36:09.733
Of course I am.

36:09.735 --> 36:12.569
I love you, jane.

36:12.571 --> 36:14.738
I love you now,
and I'll love you forever.

36:14.740 --> 36:17.741
And whatever's going on
with you and rafael,

36:17.743 --> 36:20.177
It's not gonna last.

36:21.846 --> 36:23.847
You're wrong.

36:23.849 --> 36:25.415
Really?

36:26.617 --> 36:28.618
So you're trying
to tell me that,

36:28.620 --> 36:30.187
At the end of the day,

36:30.189 --> 36:31.588
That's who you see
yourself with?

36:31.590 --> 36:32.789
Rafael?

36:39.330 --> 36:42.732
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Perhaps if nadine had heard</i>
<i>the words jane was saying,</i>

36:42.734 --> 36:45.735
<i>And not just seen the look</i>
<i>in michael's eyes,</i>

36:45.737 --> 36:48.738
<i>She wouldn't have done</i>
<i>what she did next.</i>

36:48.740 --> 36:50.607
<i>But she did not hear.</i>

36:50.609 --> 36:52.709
I'll change my
emergency contact.

36:54.378 --> 36:56.780
Hi, lieutenant armstrong.

36:56.782 --> 36:58.782
I have some information
on detective cordero

36:58.784 --> 37:00.617
That you need to hear.

37:00.619 --> 37:02.385
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Ah, irony.</i>

37:02.387 --> 37:03.787
He disobeyed your direct order.

37:03.789 --> 37:05.689
Latin lover narrator:
<i>What a cruel mistress.</i>

37:11.796 --> 37:13.630
Good morning, mom!

37:13.632 --> 37:15.699
Ah,    <i>buenos dÃ­a.</i>

37:20.771 --> 37:21.938
No, I didn't.

37:21.940 --> 37:24.674
But I talked to rogelio
about it last night,

37:24.676 --> 37:25.775
And he was sweet
and understanding,

37:25.777 --> 37:27.510
And he said that he will wait

37:27.512 --> 37:29.713
Until I decide
it's the right time.

37:38.289 --> 37:39.723
I know,
you were right.

37:39.725 --> 37:40.857
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

37:42.827 --> 37:45.996
How do you know exactly
what I said to god?

37:47.665 --> 37:48.932
I won't let a man

37:48.934 --> 37:50.900
Between these legs again
without a ring.

37:56.841 --> 37:58.742
Uh-uh, those were
my exact words.

37:58.744 --> 38:01.411
<i>Bueno.</i>

38:11.956 --> 38:13.757
You what?!

38:18.996 --> 38:20.830
Yeah.

38:20.832 --> 38:22.032
Maybe.

38:22.034 --> 38:24.367
But still it
was wrong.

38:28.005 --> 38:29.306
An apology letter? Why?

38:30.308 --> 38:32.709
Hey, you two.

38:32.711 --> 38:34.577
So...
(clears throat)

38:34.579 --> 38:35.845
I, uh, just
talked to rafael.

38:35.847 --> 38:37.647
And I made a decision.

38:37.649 --> 38:38.782
I'm taking the teaching job.

38:38.784 --> 38:40.784
Look, if I
had a talent

38:40.786 --> 38:42.752
For writing telenovelas,
that'd be one thing.

38:42.754 --> 38:43.853
But I don't, so...

38:43.855 --> 38:45.655
I made my choice.

38:47.858 --> 38:49.926
Well, those kids are
lucky to have you.

38:53.597 --> 38:56.800
Xiomara: What apology letters
are you talking about, mom?

38:56.802 --> 38:59.502
I haven't
written you any.

38:59.504 --> 39:01.504
Remember...

39:01.506 --> 39:04.341
It was for a good cause.

39:04.343 --> 39:06.609
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Which brings us here, now,</i>

39:06.611 --> 39:08.611
<i>Where jane walks</i>
<i>with a heavy heart,</i>

39:08.613 --> 39:11.948
<i>Ready to say farewell</i>
<i>to writing, for the time being.</i>

39:16.020 --> 39:17.887
Jane!

39:17.889 --> 39:19.022
Hey, dina.

39:19.024 --> 39:20.757
Do you need something?

39:20.759 --> 39:22.625
I wanted to just tell you
I really enjoyed your scene.

39:22.627 --> 39:24.828
What scene?
The one you wrote
for rogelio.

39:24.830 --> 39:26.629
Nicholas slipped
it to me.

39:26.631 --> 39:28.898
For a first timer,
you show a lot of potential.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.900
Wow, really?

39:30.902 --> 39:32.836
But rogelio said
it wasn't very good.

39:32.838 --> 39:36.072
That's because there's not
a lot of yelling and crying.

39:36.074 --> 39:37.907
Trust me.

39:37.909 --> 39:40.377
I get paid to know
good writing.

39:40.379 --> 39:41.845
Keep working at it.

39:48.419 --> 39:50.854
I'm scared, lachlan--
I don't know what to do.

39:50.856 --> 39:52.856
Those yellow tulips,
it means that milos is here.

39:52.858 --> 39:53.990
I just don't understand
what happened.

40:04.068 --> 40:06.936
I posted a permanent
private guard at your door.

40:06.938 --> 40:09.873
I promise I will
keep you safe.

40:12.543 --> 40:15.879
So I made a decision.

40:15.881 --> 40:17.881
If you're quitting, you don't
have to let me down easy.

40:17.883 --> 40:18.948
I understand.

40:18.950 --> 40:21.951
Teaching is...

40:21.953 --> 40:23.720
Well, someone has
to do it, right?

40:23.722 --> 40:25.955
I'm not quitting.

40:25.957 --> 40:27.957
I was going to, but dina...

40:27.959 --> 40:31.761
She thinks I have talent,
and that's all I needed to hear.

40:31.763 --> 40:33.096
You know, the
baby's coming.

40:33.098 --> 40:35.765
This is my chance.

40:36.734 --> 40:37.967
I'm glad you're staying.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.571
But, jane, this is
a tough business.

40:41.573 --> 40:43.973
You can't look to others
to validate you.

40:43.975 --> 40:46.976
If you choose to make
a living in the financial arts,

40:46.978 --> 40:48.978
You must believe in yourself.

40:48.980 --> 40:53.149
You know, that's really
good advice, rogelio.

40:53.151 --> 40:56.119
Latin lover narrator:
<i>It really, really was.</i>

40:57.621 --> 40:59.456
All right...

40:59.458 --> 41:00.857
She's staying on here.

41:00.859 --> 41:02.158
Perfect.

41:02.160 --> 41:04.594
Latin lover narrator:
<i>In fact, it was advice</i>

41:04.596 --> 41:05.895
<i>Rogelio would need himself,</i>
<i>in the weeks to come.</i>

41:05.897 --> 41:07.797
Rogelio won't know what hit him.

41:22.880 --> 41:25.882
I don't like this, not one bit.
