<i>Big news
in the financial world today.</i>

00:12.513 --> 00:14.682
<i>Once again, billionaire Bruce Wayne</i>

00:14.765 --> 00:17.059
<i>has inverted an attempted
takeover of his company</i>

00:17.143 --> 00:19.562
<i>by Derek Powers of Powers Technology.</i>

00:19.645 --> 00:21.480
<i>Powers vowed that he is not through yet</i>

00:21.814 --> 00:24.817
<i>and speculation has seen stock
in both men's companies</i>

00:24.901 --> 00:26.819
<i>hit all-time highs.</i>

00:27.111 --> 00:30.323
<i>Still no word from the kidnappers
of debutante Bunny Vreeland</i>

00:30.406 --> 00:33.618
<i>following a ransom payment
of five million dollars...</i>

00:34.202 --> 00:35.661
Hey, kid! You're on TV.

00:35.745 --> 00:38.331
<i>Police remain without leads
as to the girl's whereabouts.</i>

00:44.295 --> 00:45.755
Ahhh! Ugh!

01:06.984 --> 01:09.070
It's all here. Take care of her.

01:21.123 --> 01:22.291
Batman!

01:45.356 --> 01:46.983
Are you all right?

02:01.122 --> 02:03.249
Ever since I was a kid,
big, bad Batman's

02:03.332 --> 02:06.294
always been making life hard
for guys like me.

02:22.727 --> 02:24.228
No, don't!

03:12.234 --> 03:13.903
Never again.

04:43.742 --> 04:45.369
<i>Making news today, as every day,</i>

04:45.453 --> 04:47.955
<i>Gotham's own financial czar,
Derek Powers</i>

04:48.038 --> 04:51.959
<i>rocked the stock market by acquiring
several local industrial firms.</i>

04:52.042 --> 04:54.211
<i>Everyone loves a winner, right, Kim?</i>

04:54.712 --> 04:55.921
<i>That's right, Tom.</i>

04:56.005 --> 04:58.674
<i>In the third hostile
Wayne-Powers takeover this year,</i>

04:58.757 --> 05:00.217
<i>Powers has retained his crown</i>

05:00.301 --> 05:02.761
<i>as Gotham's most dynamic
corporate kingpin.</i>

05:02.845 --> 05:05.389
<i>Insiders' fears of downsizing
were realized today</i>

05:05.473 --> 05:08.267
<i>as Powers personally announced
over 300 layoffs.</i>

05:08.476 --> 05:11.061
<i>The handsome CEO
may not be making many friends,</i>

05:11.145 --> 05:13.230
<i>but he's sure making money.</i>

05:13.314 --> 05:14.982
<i>Turning to the local weather,
good news...</i>

05:15.065 --> 05:17.026
Ah, thank you. Thank you.

05:23.782 --> 05:24.867
Ah.

05:25.576 --> 05:27.786
Oh. I saw you smile.

05:28.204 --> 05:30.122
Yes, I did, yes, I did.

05:30.623 --> 05:32.500
What do you want?

05:32.583 --> 05:34.752
Payment for the joke you bought.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.338
I give you funny, you give me money.

05:37.546 --> 05:39.048
I didn't buy anything!

05:42.635 --> 05:45.221
Ah, you're shy. It's okay.

05:45.304 --> 05:46.889
I'll just help myself.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.726
- Ugh!
- Get lost, clown!

05:52.186 --> 05:53.854
Big man.

05:58.442 --> 05:59.652
That does it!

06:09.078 --> 06:10.078
Jokers.

06:17.086 --> 06:18.671
If the coach had us do one more lap,

06:18.754 --> 06:20.381
I'd be sprouting gills.

06:20.464 --> 06:25.010
Nelson! Nelson! Nelson!
Nelson! Nelson...

06:25.219 --> 06:28.222
Sounds like Nelson's got his monkeys
rooting for him again.

06:29.139 --> 06:32.935
Who's the victim this time? Terry!

06:35.521 --> 06:37.606
- Yes...
- My money is on Nelson.

06:37.773 --> 06:39.650
Wouldn't be too sure, Chelsea.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.485
You've never wrestled with him.

06:42.695 --> 06:44.071
Fold, dreg.

06:44.154 --> 06:46.615
- I got you beat.
- Funny.

06:46.699 --> 06:48.784
You remind me of a joker
I meet this morning.

06:48.993 --> 06:50.911
Except he was prettier.

06:52.997 --> 06:53.997
Ugh!

06:58.836 --> 07:00.838
Oh, boy. Not again.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.134
That's it, McGinnis!
Get your clothes and get out!

07:05.217 --> 07:06.594
- But he just...
- But nothing!

07:06.677 --> 07:09.179
I saw you throw the first punch! Out!

07:18.856 --> 07:21.442
Research, McGinnis.
<i>- Warren, it's Harry.</i>

07:21.650 --> 07:23.402
Can you meet me
on the landing, right away?

07:23.485 --> 07:25.738
<i>Sure. Is everything all right?</i>

07:26.947 --> 07:28.449
I'll explain when I see you.

07:40.544 --> 07:41.670
Harry?

07:42.254 --> 07:44.423
- You look slagged.
- Never mind that.

07:44.506 --> 07:46.425
Here, keep this for me.

07:51.180 --> 07:53.265
- What's wrong with your hand?
- Nothing!

07:54.850 --> 07:57.394
Warren, if anything
should happen to me...

07:57.645 --> 07:59.730
There you are, Mr. Tully.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.358
You're late for your meeting
with Mr. Powers.

08:04.193 --> 08:05.361
Harry!

08:06.487 --> 08:08.155
Come back here!

08:19.667 --> 08:21.126
What's wrong with him?

08:31.553 --> 08:34.431
I asked you here, Warren,
to clear up any misconceptions

08:34.515 --> 08:37.142
you might have gotten
from that incident with Mr. Tully.

08:37.393 --> 08:39.395
Harry simply suffered
an allergic reaction

08:39.478 --> 08:41.730
to a chemical compound in the lab.

08:41.897 --> 08:44.733
Shook him up a bit,
but he's under the best of care.

08:44.942 --> 08:46.819
That's great. When can I see him?

08:46.902 --> 08:48.987
Monday morning, first thing.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.614
Thank you, Mr. Powers.

08:51.115 --> 08:52.658
Don't mention it, Warren.

08:54.284 --> 08:57.287
Oh, Warren. Before I forget.

08:57.371 --> 09:00.541
There seems to be a file missing
from Harry's records.

09:00.666 --> 09:02.209
Would you know where it is?

09:02.960 --> 09:04.503
No, sir. I have no idea.

09:05.003 --> 09:06.839
No, of course not.

09:22.020 --> 09:24.314
Harry, what were you working on?

09:26.650 --> 09:28.277
Powers can't be serious.

09:29.528 --> 09:31.989
- He must be out of his mind to think...
- Knock, knock.

09:33.031 --> 09:35.701
- Terry, I'm busy.
- Dad, I got to go out.

09:35.784 --> 09:38.287
- You're grounded, remember?
- I didn't start the fight!

09:38.370 --> 09:40.570
I'll hear all about it
when we meet with your counselor.

09:40.622 --> 09:42.332
- Again.
- Mom would hear me out!

09:42.666 --> 09:44.376
You're not living with your mom!

09:44.501 --> 09:45.586
Don't remind me!

09:45.669 --> 09:47.254
That's your problem, right there!

09:47.546 --> 09:49.274
You can't control your temper,
and you'd better

09:49.298 --> 09:50.817
if you expect to get anywhere in life.

09:50.841 --> 09:53.677
Yeah,
I'll be a big success. Just like you.

09:55.387 --> 09:56.680
I'm bailing.

09:57.723 --> 09:59.057
Terry?

10:16.366 --> 10:17.826
- Ooh.
- Hey!

10:17.910 --> 10:19.495
I thought you were in solitary?

10:19.578 --> 10:21.872
I gave myself time off
for good behavior.

10:22.331 --> 10:23.331
I'm glad.

10:34.551 --> 10:36.720
Whoa! Don't go messing things up again.

10:44.728 --> 10:47.648
Evening, boys and girls!
Who's up for some laughs?

10:50.651 --> 10:51.819
Hey!

10:54.238 --> 10:55.072
OW!

10:55.155 --> 10:57.616
You're not smiling.

10:57.699 --> 11:00.369
- Knock it off!
- I would if you'd hold still.

11:02.579 --> 11:04.581
Oh, cheer up, sweetness.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.083
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.

11:07.209 --> 11:08.209
Stop.

11:08.252 --> 11:10.379
Hands off, dreg!

11:10.671 --> 11:11.671
Ugh!

11:13.715 --> 11:15.175
Split his sides!

11:27.062 --> 11:28.814
I knew McGinnis was a freak job.

11:28.897 --> 11:29.897
Oh, no!

11:32.150 --> 11:34.695
Fun time!

11:34.820 --> 11:36.280
Get out of here! Hurry!

13:02.407 --> 13:05.369
Oh! The no-fun boy had an accident.

13:05.744 --> 13:07.704
Let's put a smile on his face.

13:07.788 --> 13:09.498
Leave him alone.

13:13.335 --> 13:16.213
And get of my property.
You're trespassing.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.298
Oh, is that right?

13:18.882 --> 13:20.926
It's okay. I can handle this.

13:21.802 --> 13:24.054
Who do you think
you're talking to, old man?

13:25.263 --> 13:26.848
We're the Jokerz.

13:26.932 --> 13:28.183
Sure you are.

13:57.004 --> 13:58.004
Ahhh!

14:05.262 --> 14:06.596
Come on!

14:17.441 --> 14:20.027
Man, you're something.
I've never seen anyone...

14:25.032 --> 14:26.199
Are you okay?

14:26.992 --> 14:28.160
My medicine.

14:29.619 --> 14:30.829
At the house.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.677
Down, Ace! He's okay.

14:50.599 --> 14:53.185
- Nice dog.
- Not really.

14:58.315 --> 14:59.483
Here you go.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.234
The pills were right where you said.

15:07.574 --> 15:10.160
Well, then, I guess
you're gonna rest now, huh?

15:10.911 --> 15:12.204
You go right ahead.

15:12.287 --> 15:14.456
My dad's probably
waiting up for me anyway.

15:14.706 --> 15:16.249
I'll just let myself out.

15:17.209 --> 15:18.668
Hope you feel better, mister...

15:30.972 --> 15:33.600
On second thought, maybe
I should give my dad a call.

15:36.561 --> 15:38.396
Here's where I'm grounded for life.

15:46.404 --> 15:47.823
A bat?

15:50.325 --> 15:52.452
I'll get you out of there,
just don't bite me.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.454
Huh?

16:14.641 --> 16:15.641
Wow!

16:36.037 --> 16:38.373
Geez! No wonder he could fight.

16:43.086 --> 16:44.254
Get out!

16:48.341 --> 16:49.801
All right, I'm going!

16:51.678 --> 16:53.138
It's not like I did anything wrong.

16:56.224 --> 16:57.392
Freak.

17:11.948 --> 17:13.241
Dad?

17:15.327 --> 17:16.620
Oh, my God.

17:20.832 --> 17:22.167
- Huh!
- Terry!

17:23.960 --> 17:25.295
You're okay.

17:27.047 --> 17:29.549
- Mom, what happened?
- A robbery.

17:29.841 --> 17:31.426
The police say it's the Jokerz.

17:31.676 --> 17:33.386
They surprised your father.

17:33.929 --> 17:35.764
Where is he? Where's Dad?

17:36.389 --> 17:37.807
Honey, I...

17:40.477 --> 17:41.686
Dad?

17:42.979 --> 17:44.147
Dad!

17:45.232 --> 17:47.525
<i>McGinnis leaves behind two sons,</i>

17:47.609 --> 17:49.861
<i>seen here with his former wife, Mary.</i>

17:50.820 --> 17:54.783
<i>Among the mourners
was McGinnis' employer, Derek Powers.</i>

17:54.950 --> 17:58.036
<i>I pledge to use
whatever influence I have</i>

17:58.119 --> 18:01.581
<i>to see that these creatures
pay for their heinous act.</i>

18:06.711 --> 18:08.046
It was about Dad.

18:08.421 --> 18:09.631
I know, hon.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.443
Why don't you get ready for bed, okay?

18:11.549 --> 18:12.884
'Kay.

18:19.307 --> 18:21.059
That friend of yours,
Dana, called...

18:21.309 --> 18:22.310
She left her number.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.313
Have you eaten anything yet?

18:27.482 --> 18:30.110
Ter, you haven't said a word all day.

18:30.277 --> 18:31.903
Don't you wanna talk?

18:32.362 --> 18:34.406
Why would he open the door, Mom?

18:34.489 --> 18:36.283
- What?
- They were Jokerz.

18:36.366 --> 18:38.785
He wouldn't have opened the door,
he would've looked first!

18:38.868 --> 18:40.745
How'd they trace me back to him?

18:40.829 --> 18:43.331
Honey, we don't know
if it's the same gang.

18:43.415 --> 18:45.142
- You've gotta stop...
- I should have been there!

18:45.166 --> 18:47.669
I could've helped him!
I could've done something!

18:47.752 --> 18:48.878
No.

18:49.045 --> 18:51.256
Yes! I'm not afraid of those guys.

18:51.339 --> 18:53.925
We could've fought 'em off, me and Dad!
We could've fought.

18:56.052 --> 18:57.887
I yelled at him, Mom.

18:58.888 --> 19:01.433
He grounded me and I wouldn't listen.

19:03.101 --> 19:04.602
The things I said.

19:06.146 --> 19:07.647
I'm such a jerk.

19:11.359 --> 19:15.030
- Hurry up!
- I'm opening as fast as I can.

19:15.113 --> 19:16.614
You're some help, you know that?

19:16.698 --> 19:17.949
It's not my junk.

19:21.161 --> 19:23.163
I guess that's my fault, too.

19:39.888 --> 19:42.682
"In the event
of my death or disappearance."

19:43.266 --> 19:44.266
Whoa!

19:49.230 --> 19:50.315
What you got?

19:51.816 --> 19:53.360
Something Dad was looking at.

19:55.987 --> 19:57.280
Boflng!

19:59.449 --> 20:01.451
Tell Mom I had to go. I could be late.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.994
- Where you going?
- Out.

20:06.456 --> 20:08.041
Yeah, looks like we got lucky.

20:11.503 --> 20:14.297
If you just keep on this road,
it curves back to the freeway.

20:14.506 --> 20:16.216
I can't leave you out here.

20:16.591 --> 20:19.552
Sure you can.
I just have to see this guy.

20:21.971 --> 20:24.641
- About what?
- I'II explain later.

20:24.808 --> 20:26.476
You better go, before the storm hits.

20:31.981 --> 20:32.981
Go!

20:40.365 --> 20:41.866
Come on, I know you're in there!

20:44.744 --> 20:47.539
Listen to me.
Something stinks in your company.

20:47.622 --> 20:50.041
I think it cost my old man his life.

20:50.208 --> 20:52.293
The answer's on this.

20:52.377 --> 20:54.421
I'd take it to the cops,
but you know how cozy

20:54.504 --> 20:56.297
they are with Powers.

20:56.673 --> 20:58.383
How about you taking a look?

21:02.220 --> 21:04.305
Yeah, I should have known,
you wouldn't care.

21:04.681 --> 21:07.350
You're no Batman,
you wacked-out old fraud.

21:16.526 --> 21:18.194
Back off, Scooby. It's me.
