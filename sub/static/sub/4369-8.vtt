of this future lab.

00:09.240 --> 00:10.581
I want to see what
this guy's up to.

00:15.546 --> 00:17.588
Did you see the logo
on that guy's suit?

00:17.588 --> 00:19.290
Yeah. What do you
think it was?

00:19.290 --> 00:20.491
I don't know.

00:20.491 --> 00:22.223
But now,
we have a clue.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.554

00:37.308 --> 00:39.240
I'm trying to figure out
which one of these
is my water glass

is the highly
corrosive acid.

Is that acid, too?

00:53.254 --> 00:54.325
No, I just remembered.

00:54.325 --> 00:55.626
I needed this spoon
for my yogurt!

00:57.458 --> 00:59.590
So, what's up?
Barry, we have huge news.

00:59.590 --> 01:02.533
Yes, go on. I just need to
check on some experiments
around my lab.

01:02.533 --> 01:04.535
We jumped back
to the future lab!

01:04.535 --> 01:06.597
You know,
with the glowing tables
that we're strapped onto.

01:06.597 --> 01:08.569
Only this time,
we saw someone enter.

01:08.569 --> 01:09.740
And he...
Or she...

01:09.740 --> 01:12.273
We hope the evil lab
is an equal opportunity
employer.

01:13.544 --> 01:16.647
So that jerk of a man...
Or powerful woman...

01:16.647 --> 01:18.779
Had a logo on his
or her chest!

01:18.779 --> 01:20.311
It's a clue!

01:20.311 --> 01:21.312
Mmm-hmm.

01:23.614 --> 01:25.486
The logo was
really unique.

01:25.486 --> 01:28.359
It had this circle.
Like, maybe a planet.

01:28.359 --> 01:29.390
Yeah, a planet.

01:29.390 --> 01:30.621
And a letter
in the middle.

01:30.621 --> 01:32.663
Was it a "D"?
Or a "C"?

01:32.663 --> 01:34.295
We saw it
pretty quickly.

01:34.295 --> 01:35.726
But I'd know it
if I saw it again.

01:38.769 --> 01:41.732
And it had one of those
science-y symbols around it.

01:41.732 --> 01:43.504
I bet you know
what it's called.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.608
You probably have something
like that around here.

01:50.381 --> 01:52.613
That's it!
And it's there, too!

We can't let him
know we know.

What if he's involved
in the future lab?

01:58.689 --> 02:00.591
We have to go
figure this out!

02:00.591 --> 02:02.423
All right, girls.
I'm done with my experiments.

02:02.423 --> 02:04.555
You have my full,
undivided attention.

That's what I get
for paying attention.

02:11.832 --> 02:13.834
Renaldo, if I knew why
girls did anything,

02:13.834 --> 02:16.837
do you think I'd spend
so much time alone
in this lab?

02:16.837 --> 02:18.669
The answer is
"Yes, I would."

03:47.798 --> 03:50.501
Let's go talk
to Barry.

03:50.501 --> 03:53.504
We'll do the classic bad cop,
klutzy cop routine.

03:53.504 --> 03:54.665
Which one am I?
(SCREAMS)

03:57.838 --> 04:00.841

04:19.860 --> 04:22.893
I can't believe
Shelby and Cyd are

04:22.893 --> 04:25.866
I can't believe we have to
wait to see what happens next.

04:25.866 --> 04:28.799
We don't have to wait.
Let's follow them
and find out!

04:28.799 --> 04:29.900
Good thinking, Chet.

04:29.900 --> 04:31.642
That's why you're
the idea man.

04:31.642 --> 04:32.743

important thing

to me about?

04:38.679 --> 04:39.880
Oh, it's nothing big.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.712
We're just wondering
what's new with you,
Barry.

04:41.712 --> 04:42.813
Come on,
you can tell us.

04:42.813 --> 04:45.486

Whoa! If I didn't
know any better,

04:46.957 --> 04:49.820

04:51.692 --> 04:53.524

you... (SCREAMS)

04:54.725 --> 04:56.567
Watch out, Barry.

04:56.567 --> 04:59.600
They're running the classic
bad cop, klutzy cop routine.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.001
Enough games.
Explain this.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.673
(GASPS)
All right, Klutzy Cop.
You broke me.

05:02.673 --> 05:04.805
It's a water bottle.

05:04.805 --> 05:08.038
This logo is the same one
we saw in the future lab.

05:08.038 --> 05:09.880
Why is it on
everything in here?

05:09.880 --> 05:11.882
That's the GloboDigiDyne logo.

05:11.882 --> 05:14.885
It's a major corporation that
manufactures everything from

05:14.885 --> 05:17.618
computers to military
defense systems.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.720
Barry's a big fan
of GloboDigiDyne.

05:19.720 --> 05:20.951
He even collects
their trading cards.

05:20.951 --> 05:23.794
I have doubles of
Barbara from HR.

05:23.794 --> 05:26.997
And a very rare Keith
from IT rookie card.

05:26.997 --> 05:29.800
There are only two.
Keith's mother has
the other one.

05:31.802 --> 05:33.033
I love GDD. In fact,

05:33.033 --> 05:34.965
today I've blocked out
my entire afternoon

05:34.965 --> 05:37.608
to watch the new product
announcement by Janet Smythe,

05:37.608 --> 05:38.769
the company's CEO.

05:38.769 --> 05:40.671
We don't even know
what the product is,

05:40.671 --> 05:43.874
but the Internet calls it
"a cash grab by
a soulless corporation."

05:43.874 --> 05:45.676
How awesome
does that sound?

05:47.548 --> 05:50.721
I hope one day Janet Smythe
will announce a new product
that I've created.

05:50.721 --> 05:52.623
Like my new app...

05:52.623 --> 05:53.724
The Pocket Audience.

05:53.724 --> 05:54.885
Here's my sales pitch.

05:54.885 --> 05:56.927
How many times have you
been in a conversation

05:56.927 --> 06:00.731
when you said something funny
and no one laughed?

06:00.731 --> 06:02.833
That happens to me
all the time.

06:02.833 --> 06:04.695
There must be
a better way.

06:06.737 --> 06:09.970
Well, my new app listens to
every conversation you have

06:09.970 --> 06:12.903
and responds like
a live studio audience.

06:12.903 --> 06:14.104
Watch this...

06:14.104 --> 06:15.776
Aw, shuds.

06:20.110 --> 06:22.683
Well, we have
bigger problems.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.685
What does it mean
that the GloboDigiDyne logo

06:24.685 --> 06:26.016
is all over
the future lab?

06:26.016 --> 06:27.658
Well, if you're concerned
about that,

06:27.658 --> 06:29.089
you should really ask
Shelby's father.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.791
He works for
GloboDigiDyne.

06:30.791 --> 06:33.864
No, he doesn't.
He's an accountant
at some big company.

06:33.864 --> 06:35.025
What's the company called?
I don't know.

06:35.025 --> 06:36.627
It's GloboDigiDyne.

06:44.835 --> 06:48.108
I can't believe my dad
works for GloboDigiDyne.

06:48.108 --> 06:51.982
I can't believe we
didn't notice the logos
on all your dishes.

06:55.846 --> 06:58.619
Do you think your dad
knows about the future lab

06:58.619 --> 06:59.950
where we're strapped
to those tables?

06:59.950 --> 07:03.724
I think it's time for us to be
Detectives Cyd and Shelby.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.125
But we can't let him know
that we're on to him,

07:05.125 --> 07:07.998
so we're gonna have to
play it totally cool.

07:07.998 --> 07:10.000
Tell us what you know,
you filthy scrunch!

07:11.862 --> 07:15.005
Cyd, don't talk to
my dad like that.

GloboDigiDyne, right?

07:17.167 --> 07:19.039
Why? What have
you heard?

07:19.039 --> 07:22.012
Did they call about
the dishes I took?

07:22.012 --> 07:24.144
No, we're just wondering
about your job.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.176
You've never been
interested before.

07:26.176 --> 07:30.721

not being interested
in where your dad works.

hanging you out to dry,

the same thing to you.

get through this.

we're whispering like this?

Then I can't let you in.

It's because we're

09:56.997 --> 09:58.869
Come on, we need to
find my dad's office

09:58.869 --> 10:00.130
and try to figure out
what he's hiding.

10:00.130 --> 10:03.934
It says here his office is in
L-24-west-3.

10:03.934 --> 10:05.175
What floor are we on?
Purple.

10:07.077 --> 10:08.208
Come on, I think
it's this way.

10:12.142 --> 10:14.314
This GloboDigiPop
is great popcorn.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.887
And I love that it has
no natural ingredients.

10:16.887 --> 10:18.148
You can really taste
the petroleum.

10:19.850 --> 10:21.151
Ooh, Janet Smythe is on.

10:21.151 --> 10:23.894
I hope she doesn't introduce
a pocket audience app.

10:23.894 --> 10:25.155
I've worked
so hard on mine,

10:25.155 --> 10:27.257
it would be devastating
if someone beat me to it.

10:27.257 --> 10:29.259
Don't worry, buddy.
You'll have your day.

10:29.259 --> 10:31.031
(CANNED COOING)

10:31.031 --> 10:32.262
We had a nice
moment there,

10:32.262 --> 10:34.134
but I feel like your app
kind of cheapened it.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.068
GloboDigiDyne.

10:38.068 --> 10:40.811
What is it?
 Who is it?

10:40.811 --> 10:42.973
In a way,
aren't we all?

10:42.973 --> 10:45.115
(APPLAUSE)

10:45.115 --> 10:48.819
Welcome to our latest
innovation in futurality.

10:48.819 --> 10:50.220
I give you

10:50.220 --> 10:52.222
GloboDigiBots!

11:00.060 --> 11:03.934
Security robots controlled
by the brain waves

11:03.934 --> 11:06.336
of the operators who
wear these helmets.

11:07.337 --> 11:09.199
(APPLAUSE, CHEERING)

11:09.199 --> 11:10.871
(WHIRRING)

11:13.343 --> 11:16.176
Your adulation feels
like a mother's love.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.177
I'm guessing.

11:18.278 --> 11:20.150
Shortly we'll have
a demonstration

11:20.150 --> 11:23.213
where the GloboDigiBots
take down two intruders

11:23.213 --> 11:26.086
on level Orange of this
very building.

11:26.086 --> 11:27.888
(APPLAUSE)

11:30.260 --> 11:32.262
That was Shelby and Cyd!

11:32.262 --> 11:34.995
Why'd you think
your dad's office would
be behind that curtain?

11:34.995 --> 11:37.167
You're only saying that
because it wasn't there.

11:37.167 --> 11:38.298
If it was there
you'd be all like,

11:38.298 --> 11:40.871
"Yeah! I'm glad we looked
behind that curtain."

11:41.872 --> 11:43.303
You're right, I totally
would've said that.

11:44.875 --> 11:46.136
We need to warn
Shelby and Cyd

11:46.136 --> 11:47.377
that there's about to be
a demonstration

11:47.377 --> 11:49.379
of security robots
in the very hallway

11:49.379 --> 11:51.141
that they are
sneaking around in.

11:51.141 --> 11:53.383
So the girls are gonna come
face to face with robots?

11:53.383 --> 11:55.045
They're living my dream!

11:55.045 --> 11:57.117
Why is it your dream to come
face to face with robots?

11:58.188 --> 11:59.920
So I can teach
them to love.

12:05.195 --> 12:08.058
Level Green. How did we
get here from Purple?

12:08.058 --> 12:10.961
And where is Dad's office
L-24-west-3?

12:10.961 --> 12:12.262
This place is
so confusing.

12:12.262 --> 12:14.134
Yes, I found it!
Dad's office?

12:14.134 --> 12:17.407
No, the bathroom.
I've been holding it since
N-18-2-south-7!

12:20.240 --> 12:22.242
(THUDS, WHIRRING)

12:24.444 --> 12:26.076
(WHIRRING)

12:29.249 --> 12:31.982
We still haven't found
Shelby and Cyd, Bret.

12:31.982 --> 12:34.254
But we did find these
cool helmets, Chet.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.355
Let's put them on!

12:37.027 --> 12:38.158
(WHIRRING)

12:38.158 --> 12:39.359
Now, let's go find
the girls.

12:41.031 --> 12:43.033
Hey, watch where
you're going!

12:47.267 --> 12:49.099
Okay, the girls aren't
answering their phones,

12:49.099 --> 12:50.440
so we'll need to
warn them in person.

12:50.440 --> 12:52.202
Are we here to
warn them in person,

12:52.202 --> 12:53.303
or so you can
pitch your app?

12:53.303 --> 12:56.246
Renaldo, we're here
to help our friends.

12:56.246 --> 12:59.009
And if I also get a chance to
pitch my app, why not?

12:59.009 --> 13:02.312
I'll take any app-vantage
I can get.

13:02.312 --> 13:03.483
(INSECTS CHIRPING)

13:03.483 --> 13:05.055
Hey, come on!

13:06.116 --> 13:08.258
Ha! "App-vantage."

13:08.258 --> 13:10.360
(CANNED APPLAUSE)

13:10.360 --> 13:12.062
I think it's in
the delivery.

13:13.363 --> 13:16.126
Okay, I've hacked into
GDD's email server and

13:16.126 --> 13:17.527
sent the security
desk a message

13:17.527 --> 13:21.101
to expect a genius teen
scientist and a new mail boy.

13:21.101 --> 13:22.102
Follow my lead.

13:23.333 --> 13:26.036
Hello, I'm a genius
teen scientist.

13:28.338 --> 13:30.480
And I suppose
that makes me
the new mail boy.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.146
Why are you walking
like that?

13:36.146 --> 13:37.487
I'm walking like
a teen genius.

13:37.487 --> 13:40.120
I don't walk like that.
That's because
you're a mail boy.

13:43.253 --> 13:46.296
I mean, I like the environment
as much as the next girl,

13:46.296 --> 13:48.258
but I also like
dry hands!

13:51.331 --> 13:55.235
Shelby's diary is the most
exciting book I've ever lived!

13:55.235 --> 13:56.506
Tummy taps!

13:56.506 --> 13:58.108

14:04.244 --> 14:06.146
Here you go.
Have an envelope.

14:06.146 --> 14:07.347
Would you like
this package?

14:07.347 --> 14:09.319
And other things
a mail boy might say.

14:11.121 --> 14:12.322
Renaldo, don't just
sit there.

14:12.322 --> 14:13.483
We have to find
Shelby and Cyd

14:13.483 --> 14:15.455
and warn them about
the security robots.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.157
Just a second.

14:17.157 --> 14:19.459

a genius teen scientist.

My-reka!

14:28.398 --> 14:30.400
Oh, my gosh. It's her.
Excuse me.

14:30.400 --> 14:31.541
I'm a huge fan,
Ms. Smythe.

14:31.541 --> 14:33.373
If I could just
have a moment.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.574
Here's my sales pitch...

14:34.574 --> 14:36.346
How many times have you
had a conversation

14:36.346 --> 14:39.109
when you said something funny
but no one laughed?

14:39.109 --> 14:40.210
Never.

14:42.082 --> 14:45.255
Okay, so the last office was
L-24-west-2.

14:45.255 --> 14:48.118
So the next office should be
L-24-west-3.

14:48.118 --> 14:49.419

die in here.

mean anything?

15:23.553 --> 15:25.195

of security robots.

isn't it?

I wish I could be you.

right now.

16:00.590 --> 16:03.263
Oh. Excuse me.

16:03.263 --> 16:06.266
I wouldn't be handed this
if it weren't very important.

16:06.266 --> 16:07.667
Hello? Mother?

16:07.667 --> 16:10.570
I'm right in the middle
of a presentation,
why aren't you watching?

16:10.570 --> 16:12.642
Yes, I know my brother's
a heart surgeon.

16:12.642 --> 16:14.304
No, I don't want to
talk to him.

16:14.304 --> 16:15.545
Do not put him on...
Hey, Dave.

16:19.479 --> 16:20.610
(APPLAUSE)

16:21.711 --> 16:23.383
Renaldo,
what are you...

16:27.257 --> 16:30.290
Good thing we got
rid of those robots.
That was crazy.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.422
But we've been
down this hallway
three times already.

16:32.422 --> 16:33.563
We'll never get
out of here.

16:33.563 --> 16:34.724
Oh, look,
there's your dad.

16:34.724 --> 16:37.527
Oh, thank goodness.
I'm not gonna lie,
I was losing it.

16:38.668 --> 16:41.271
This is what we
came here for.

16:41.271 --> 16:43.533
Let's go spy on him to
see if he knows anything
about the future lab.

16:43.533 --> 16:46.476
Ms. Smythe, thank you
for meeting with me
about the promotion.

16:46.476 --> 16:48.238
I'm sorry
I'm so nervous.

16:48.238 --> 16:50.340
I even told my family
I couldn't talk about it,

16:50.340 --> 16:53.243
because I didn't
want to disappoint them
if I didn't get it.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.346
(SIGHS) Who am I kidding!

16:56.346 --> 16:57.547
I'm never gonna get it.

16:59.719 --> 17:02.522
That's what he was
hiding from us.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.794
He's planning to ask
his boss for a promotion.

17:04.794 --> 17:06.695
It's not about
the future lab at all.

17:06.695 --> 17:10.460
It was all about my father
crumbling under pressure.

17:10.460 --> 17:11.531
That is a relief.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.733
(THUDDING)

17:14.733 --> 17:16.435
There they are.

17:16.435 --> 17:18.367
Let's go see what adventures
they're having.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.612
It's the crazy robots!
Let's go!

17:27.676 --> 17:29.579
Barry? Naldo?
There you are.

17:29.579 --> 17:32.352
We came to warn you
to beware of the robots.

17:32.352 --> 17:33.453
(THUDS)

17:33.453 --> 17:34.624
There they are.
Beware of them.

17:39.329 --> 17:40.360
(GRUNTS)

17:41.291 --> 17:42.692
Kutzy cop,
are you okay?

17:46.366 --> 17:47.537
This is how you love.

17:49.439 --> 17:52.742
Shelby? Cyd? Boys?
What are you doing here?

17:52.742 --> 17:55.575
I was watching
the presentation on
a monitor outside.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.308
Dad, I think we made
a horrible mistake.

17:58.308 --> 18:01.751
Like the guy who
designed this building.

18:01.751 --> 18:04.554
Why are these kids
on my stage?
I hate kids.

18:04.554 --> 18:06.756
I mean, children
are our future.

18:08.388 --> 18:09.619
Excuse me, Ms. Smythe,

18:09.619 --> 18:11.691
these are my kids
and their friends.
They're good kids.

18:11.691 --> 18:12.762
I'm sure there's
an explanation...

18:12.762 --> 18:15.625
Your kids?
I should've known.

18:15.625 --> 18:18.428
Take them and get them
out of here. You're fired.

18:18.428 --> 18:20.630
But we were supposed
to talk about my
promotion today.

18:20.630 --> 18:23.603
I need someone with
passion and energy.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.435
Someone who takes
initiative.

18:25.435 --> 18:27.607
You were never getting
that promotion.

18:29.439 --> 18:30.710
We really messed up.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.442
We have to go back
and fix this.

18:39.349 --> 18:40.690
Good. We're back
to this morning.

18:40.690 --> 18:42.752
None of that crazy stuff
at GDD happened

18:42.752 --> 18:44.854
and your dad
didn't get fired.

18:44.854 --> 18:49.359
True. But because he
doesn't have passion and
energy and initiative,

18:49.359 --> 18:51.361
his boss still isn't gonna
give him that promotion,

18:51.361 --> 18:52.602
and he has no idea.

18:54.804 --> 18:55.835
Hey, Dad.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.607
The way you said
we were good kids

18:57.607 --> 19:00.670
and stood up for all of us
was really great.

19:00.670 --> 19:03.743
You should remember
that passion and
energy and initiative

19:03.743 --> 19:04.814
when you go to work.

19:04.814 --> 19:06.776
What do you mean,
"stood up for all of us"?

19:06.776 --> 19:08.478
That's not important
right now.

19:08.478 --> 19:09.719
The important thing is...

19:09.719 --> 19:12.652
Remember to show passion and
energy and initiative at work

19:12.652 --> 19:14.524
if there's something
big happening.

19:14.524 --> 19:15.825
Why do you think something
big is happening?

19:15.825 --> 19:17.527
That's not important
right now.

19:18.758 --> 19:19.829
Just remember...

19:19.829 --> 19:21.931
Passion, energy,
initiative.

19:21.931 --> 19:24.434
I believe in you, Dad.
You can do it.

19:24.434 --> 19:26.466
Do what?
That's not important
right now.

19:27.597 --> 19:29.569
Just go do it.
Yes!

19:29.569 --> 19:31.571
I don't know why
I'm saying that, but yes!

19:34.444 --> 19:35.575
That was nice, Shelbs.

19:35.575 --> 19:36.806
I hope he gets
that promotion.

19:36.806 --> 19:38.708
Me, too.

19:38.708 --> 19:41.481
Well, at least now we know
that he has nothing to do
with the future lab.

19:41.481 --> 19:43.583
Maybe it's not
even at GDD.

19:43.583 --> 19:44.814
Maybe they just
made the lab

19:44.814 --> 19:47.717
and somebody else strapped us
to those tables in the future.

19:47.717 --> 19:50.620
Well, Norm, you said
everything I need to hear.

19:50.620 --> 19:54.464
I never realized how
passionately energized
you are with initiative.

19:55.465 --> 19:56.596
Yep, that's me.

19:56.596 --> 19:57.827
And with your
promotion,

19:57.827 --> 19:59.669
you're now going
to be heavily involved

19:59.669 --> 20:02.532
with our top secret
experimental division.

20:02.532 --> 20:04.734
Code name:
Pelican Ballroom.

20:07.677 --> 20:09.809
I always wondered what was
in the Pelican Ballroom.

20:14.414 --> 20:18.418
I brought a surprise home
from work for you boys
to enjoy for the day.

20:18.418 --> 20:20.750
These are high-tech,
experimental,

20:20.750 --> 20:22.822
cutting-edge robots.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.594
Imagine all the amazing things

20:24.594 --> 20:25.695
you'll be able to
do with them.

20:25.695 --> 20:27.527
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

20:27.527 --> 20:28.858
