00:15.265 --> 00:16.766
No, you were freakin' out!

00:16.849 --> 00:18.601
[Esme] You were totally scared!

[Frankie] They're called horror movies
for a reason.

00:20.478 --> 00:21.729
I was horrified.

00:21.813 --> 00:24.023
Sorry to interrupt, but there's a minivan
outside calling our name.

00:24.107 --> 00:26.151
Your turn to take the kids to soccer?

00:26.234 --> 00:27.610
[Tiny] Tonight's gonna be amazing.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.487
I thought we could go get the food
before lunch ends.

00:31.114 --> 00:33.866
-What's tonight?
-Yeah, what's tonight, Zig?

00:33.950 --> 00:36.411
Oh, so you didn't tell your girlfriends
about our camping trip?

00:36.494 --> 00:38.038
No, he didn't.

00:39.581 --> 00:43.376
Uh, yeah, no... [stuttering]
We're going camping this weekend.

00:43.460 --> 00:45.712
Like, an unofficial grad trip.
It's a friends thing.

00:45.795 --> 00:47.089
-Who's we?
-Maya...

00:47.172 --> 00:49.382
-Of course.
-[Tiny] Uh, Grace and Jonah.

00:49.466 --> 00:51.093
They're a couple.

00:51.176 --> 00:53.511
-But we were all friends first.
-You're saying we're not friends?

00:55.930 --> 00:58.183
I just didn't think
camping was your thing.

00:58.266 --> 01:00.227
Fine. If you don't want me to come...

01:00.310 --> 01:01.394
Of course I do.

01:01.478 --> 01:03.313
And wouldn't it be so much better
if we were there?

01:04.106 --> 01:05.148
[mouthing] No.

01:05.232 --> 01:08.318
-You guys make everything more fun, but--
-[Esme] Then it's settled!

01:08.401 --> 01:10.903

for two more. [chuckles]

01:52.237 --> 01:54.656
But it'll be nice to do something together
before school ends.

01:54.739 --> 01:57.159

I can actually have some free time.

his grad camping trip this weekend.

You, Tiny, alone, in a tent...

02:23.601 --> 02:25.895
Why are we alone?
I thought everyone would be sharing tents.

02:25.978 --> 02:28.315
Oh, Shay. Sweet, young Shay.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.900
-We're the same age.
-This isn't family camping.

This is grown-up camping
with grown-up activities.

-Why not?

03:58.530 --> 03:59.781
Because we weren't really invited?

Right. 'Cause Zig's friends hate me.

-Why else would they exclude me?

04:05.370 --> 04:06.788
They want us to break up.

They'd love for him
to get back together with Maya.

05:26.784 --> 05:30.162
you're letting me go camping,
overnight, with my boyfriend.

who she lost her virginity to.

between us in the tent, what do I do?

they're weed brownies, or...

09:48.004 --> 09:49.255
[chuckles nervously]

09:50.172 --> 09:51.257
[Maya] I give up.

09:51.340 --> 09:53.300
I haven't written
anything good since "Last Exit."

09:53.384 --> 09:54.510
What if I've lost it?

09:54.594 --> 09:57.388
Well, you're not gonna be able to write
anything when you're this stressed.

09:57.471 --> 10:00.642
Yeah, you just gotta try and relax.
It'll be better for you and the music.

10:01.517 --> 10:04.646
-Do you think those would help with that?
-Step away from the edibles.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.438
You're the one that told me
you wanted me to relax.

10:06.522 --> 10:09.901
Maybe try meditation
before mind-altering substances.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.905
-Shall we?
-Uh, yeah, we need to get more wood.

10:14.906 --> 10:16.323
[Lola] Let's try
to do some chubby bunnies.

10:23.122 --> 10:24.749
-[Zig blowing raspberry]
-[Lola chuckling]

10:44.101 --> 10:45.477
[Frankie] We've been walking forever.

10:45.561 --> 10:47.229
Shouldn't we head back?
It's getting kinda dark.

10:47.313 --> 10:50.441
-We haven't found a place to swim.
-So? Everything's fine!

10:50.524 --> 10:52.735
No, it's not!
How do you not see that?

10:52.819 --> 10:54.320
Okay, stop for a second!
Are you okay?

10:55.697 --> 10:56.948
You're just acting really weird.

10:57.031 --> 10:58.991
It's weird that I don't want my boyfriend
to abandon me?

10:59.075 --> 11:01.703
-That's not gonna happen!
-You don't know that!

11:04.205 --> 11:05.247
Which is why you're in that bikini.

11:05.331 --> 11:07.875
-He can't say no to a threesome.
-Okay, hold on. I'm not doing that.

11:07.959 --> 11:10.670
Then what's the point
of you even being here?

11:10.753 --> 11:11.796
So that's all I am, then?

11:11.879 --> 11:13.297
I'm just some pet
to keep Zig's attention on you?

11:13.380 --> 11:14.423
I made you!

11:15.382 --> 11:16.383
What?

11:16.467 --> 11:18.928
You were just some pathetic girl
moping over a dumb boyfriend

11:19.011 --> 11:21.013
and I made you awesome!

11:21.097 --> 11:23.140
Now you won't even do
one little thing for me?

11:23.933 --> 11:25.642
I wouldn't call that little.

11:27.019 --> 11:31.065
You're just like everyone else.
I give you everything and you turn on me.

11:32.066 --> 11:33.109
Find your own way back.

11:41.158 --> 11:42.409
[all laughing]

11:43.285 --> 11:45.579
I should, uh, probably check on Esme.

11:45.662 --> 11:46.663
Yeah.

11:46.748 --> 11:49.000
[Tiny] Oh, man, bet we won't be
seeing him again tonight.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.626
[Jonah chuckling]

11:50.709 --> 11:52.378
Guys!

11:52.461 --> 11:56.590
I wrote the best song ever,
and in record time, too.

11:56.673 --> 11:58.134
That's what I should call it,
"Record Time."

11:58.217 --> 12:01.804
Because it's also, like,
record time, you get it?

12:01.888 --> 12:03.806
No. Not at all.

12:03.890 --> 12:04.974
Listen.

12:06.725 --> 12:07.726
Wait.

12:32.334 --> 12:34.628
-Nothing. Keep going.
-Yes. Please, keep going.

12:39.050 --> 12:40.259
Why did you just look at her?

12:42.970 --> 12:44.388
Oh, it's really hot.

12:45.306 --> 12:47.058
Is anyone else really hot?

12:47.141 --> 12:48.350
I need to sit down.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.356
Am I twirling?

12:55.691 --> 12:58.402
Whoa! Am I twirling?

12:58.485 --> 13:00.404
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

13:00.487 --> 13:03.615
-I think I just ate too many brownies.
-Brownies, plural?

13:03.699 --> 13:05.827
Okay, dude, you should
probably go lie down.

13:05.910 --> 13:08.830
Yeah, okay. I'm going.

13:10.747 --> 13:12.208
[guitar clangs]

13:12.291 --> 13:13.918
Okay, she'll probably just sleep it off.

13:14.877 --> 13:17.254
[scoffs] Oh, I'm going to bed.
These mosquitoes are the worst.

13:17.338 --> 13:18.755
[Grace] Yeah, us, too.

13:21.258 --> 13:23.594
-What? The mosquitoes are bad.
-Okay. I'm not saying anything.

13:23.677 --> 13:26.305
Did you bring a tent?
You could sleep with me and Tiny.

13:26.388 --> 13:27.556
Uh, I'm going in the car.

13:27.639 --> 13:30.184
Think a piece of nylon is gonna save me
from a bear eating my face off?

13:30.267 --> 13:32.686
Oh, there are no bears.
But coyotes, on the other hand...

13:32.769 --> 13:35.064
-Okay, good night!
-[Tiny chuckles]

13:37.358 --> 13:41.195
The coyote population isn't that big,
if that makes you feel any better.

13:43.114 --> 13:44.448
You wanna go to bed, too?

13:44.531 --> 13:46.951
Ah, but it's so nice out!

13:47.034 --> 13:50.204
-Hey! [chuckles]
-Nice. Come on.

13:50.287 --> 13:51.497
Tent's bug-free.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.263
Okay, um...

14:08.055 --> 14:09.348
good night!

14:09.431 --> 14:11.392
[chuckles] Don't you think
we should talk first?

14:12.518 --> 14:13.560
[Shay] About what?

14:14.561 --> 14:15.980
What you're not telling me?

14:20.234 --> 14:22.528
My friends think this is grown-up camping.

14:22.611 --> 14:23.863
[chuckles]

14:25.489 --> 14:26.532
Grown-up activities?

14:26.615 --> 14:27.783
[sighs]

14:29.368 --> 14:33.414
The thought did cross my mind,
but, obviously, only if you want to.

14:34.331 --> 14:35.666
I just don't know
how to tell if I'm ready.

14:35.749 --> 14:37.543
You can always talk to me, you know.

14:37.626 --> 14:39.921
Ah! Can you cut off my arm, please?

14:40.004 --> 14:41.964
[chuckles] Let me see.

14:51.390 --> 14:52.433
Ah.

14:53.559 --> 14:54.685
Always come prepared.

15:07.198 --> 15:09.283
My friends think I need to
give myself a chance

15:09.366 --> 15:11.660
to know if I'm ready...
to know if I'm ready.

15:12.869 --> 15:14.914
I'm a little confused. [chuckles]

15:14.997 --> 15:18.292
I guess I was just scared of how I'd feel
when I was actually here with you.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.922
So? How do you feel?

15:26.800 --> 15:28.260
Ready.

15:35.851 --> 15:37.979

-Mmm-hmm.

15:58.832 --> 16:02.294
Wow, I can't believe her sometimes.

16:02.378 --> 16:06.340
I just thought if I ate this bread,
[sniffles] that it would go away.

16:06.423 --> 16:07.883
But it won't go away.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.468
Okay, come on.
Maybe you should go to bed.

16:09.551 --> 16:12.638
No, I went to bed! I tried that.
It didn't work.

16:12.721 --> 16:16.933
And I still have to write a song!
Oh, my God, I have to write a song.

16:17.018 --> 16:18.810
How am I going to do that, Zig?

16:19.561 --> 16:22.356
I just keep screwing up. Forever. Always.

-Okay, all right.

16:24.775 --> 16:26.735
I'll help ya, okay?

16:28.362 --> 16:29.446
How?

16:31.991 --> 16:35.036
We'll... we'll write a song together.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.538
Okay, let's just...

16:37.621 --> 16:39.831
Let's just get you
to your tent first, okay?

16:42.334 --> 16:46.588

to the hospital.

Guess we should help with breakfast.

About last night, I can explain.

20:58.006 --> 21:00.133
-Stop.
-I really was having trouble breathing.

21:00.216 --> 21:02.052
Stop lying to me!

21:02.135 --> 21:04.638
You were alone with Maya!

21:04.721 --> 21:06.265
Because she was in trouble.
I was helping her.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.809
She put herself in trouble
so you would leave me!

21:08.892 --> 21:10.811
That is some messed-up thinking, Esme.

21:10.894 --> 21:14.898
You know, I've spent my entire year
wrapped up in your insanity.

21:14.981 --> 21:16.400
[cries] Please, don't do this.
Let's just...

21:16.483 --> 21:19.027
Let's just forget about everything
and get back to what we're good at.

21:19.110 --> 21:21.655
I'm trying to have
an actual conversation with you.

Not everything is about sex, Esme!

21:26.993 --> 21:28.370
I'm sorry, but I'm done.

21:28.454 --> 21:31.457
-Please, we can figure this out.
-No, we can't.

21:31.540 --> 21:33.750
I think you should see
if you can ride home with Frankie.

21:35.627 --> 21:37.253

21:47.973 --> 21:49.891
Okay, next time, no sparklers.

You guys almost burnt
my beautiful hair off.

21:51.727 --> 21:53.103
There were sparklers?

21:53.186 --> 21:55.731
You were passed out by then.
How are you feeling?

21:55.814 --> 21:56.940
Totally fried.

21:57.023 --> 22:00.068
Okay, well, for the record, I did say
those brownies were a bad idea, so...

22:00.151 --> 22:02.654
It wasn't all bad.
I think I figured some stuff out.

22:03.447 --> 22:04.823
Do you know what your hit song's
going to be about?

22:04.906 --> 22:09.370
No, but I realized
I gotta go easier on myself.

22:09.453 --> 22:11.372
Make my health a priority.

22:11.455 --> 22:13.248
The songs will come when they come.

22:13.332 --> 22:17.085
-What about your audition?
-If it's meant to be, it'll happen.

22:17.168 --> 22:18.795
Well, at least the brownies
helped you realize all that.

22:20.213 --> 22:21.214
It wasn't the brownies.

22:24.676 --> 22:26.762
-Oh!
-Whoa, dude! Careful!

22:26.845 --> 22:28.221
[Tiny] Sorry.

22:33.602 --> 22:35.812
Hey, you want to take this
before Tiny breaks it?

22:35.896 --> 22:37.105
Yeah.

22:45.739 --> 22:47.198
Glad you're feeling better.
