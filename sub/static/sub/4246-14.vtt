WEBVTT

00:03.574 --> 00:05.341
You almost died.
Yes.

00:05.342 --> 00:06.443
Don't do it again.

00:06.444 --> 00:08.177
Previously on "Scandal"...

00:08.178 --> 00:09.246
what do you want?
I want a divorce.

00:09.247 --> 00:11.046
I would like to marry you.

00:11.047 --> 00:13.515
Whatever's wrong, don't say
you're marrying Edison.

00:13.516 --> 00:15.049
You're willing to bring down
the whole Republic

00:15.050 --> 00:16.018
'cause you feel guilty!

00:16.020 --> 00:17.620
And if what we did gets out?

00:17.621 --> 00:19.989
Then it gets out,
and we are brought to justice.

00:19.990 --> 00:21.624
You are not the president.

00:21.625 --> 00:23.993
Hollis Doyle rigged the voting machines.

00:23.994 --> 00:25.529
It's a go.
We all helped cover it up.

00:25.530 --> 00:28.164
Mellie? Cyrus? Olivia?

00:28.165 --> 00:30.466
I told Edison I wouldn't marry him.

00:30.467 --> 00:32.101
I changed my mind about that.

00:32.101 --> 00:34.070
What?
Don't wait for me.

01:21.985 --> 01:24.286
Honey, I'm back.

01:24.287 --> 01:26.021
Do you have it?

01:26.022 --> 01:27.623
It's 7:00 in the morning.

01:27.624 --> 01:30.125
Do you have it or not?

01:30.126 --> 01:31.227
Yes.

01:35.131 --> 01:37.467
You didn't sleep at all
last night. Maybe you should--

01:37.468 --> 01:38.934
don't.

01:38.935 --> 01:41.338
Okay.

02:06.263 --> 02:08.531
What are you doing?

02:08.532 --> 02:11.300
I thought you could use
a little morning pick-me-up.

02:11.301 --> 02:13.469
Mellie--
Shh.

02:13.470 --> 02:15.237
You don't have to do anything.

02:15.238 --> 02:16.906
I'll do all the work.

02:16.907 --> 02:18.240
Mellie...

02:32.522 --> 02:34.924
Ignore it.

02:36.226 --> 02:38.460
Yes?!

02:38.461 --> 02:40.062
Mr. President?

02:41.498 --> 02:43.198
Cyrus, you're in my bathroom.

02:43.199 --> 02:44.967
Yes, sir, Mr. President.

02:44.968 --> 02:46.436
I'm as unhappy about that as you are.

02:46.437 --> 02:49.538
I sent two aides, and neither
had the courage to knock.

02:49.539 --> 02:50.540
Sir?

02:51.608 --> 02:54.543
Hi, Cyrus.

02:54.544 --> 02:57.179
Good morning... ma'am.

02:57.180 --> 02:59.481
A-All set for
the christening tomorrow?

02:59.482 --> 03:02.918
Yes. Thank you. Sir?

03:02.919 --> 03:04.987
You have bad news.

03:04.988 --> 03:06.923
Four Americans have been
kidnapped abroad.

03:25.342 --> 03:26.875
Oh, God.

03:26.876 --> 03:28.612
Oh, God.

03:31.514 --> 03:34.017
Oh, God, Oh, God, oh, God.

03:35.185 --> 03:36.919
Mr. Rosen? Police!

03:46.096 --> 03:47.496
Mr. Rosen?

03:47.497 --> 03:49.431
Be right there!

03:49.432 --> 03:51.200
Mr. Rosen?

03:51.201 --> 03:52.969
I'm officer Drew.
This is officer Bristol.

03:52.970 --> 03:55.404
Hello. Hi. Uh, I'm sorry.

03:55.405 --> 03:56.640
Took a second to answer the door.

03:56.641 --> 03:59.608
I had to, uh, throw some pants on.

03:59.609 --> 04:01.577
Anyway, what can I do for you?

04:01.578 --> 04:03.612
We got a call
from one of your neighbors.

04:03.613 --> 04:05.482
Said they heard a disturbance
coming from your place.

04:05.483 --> 04:08.017
Really? No, uh...
not that I--

04:08.018 --> 04:10.052
No. I don't--

04:10.053 --> 04:12.054
what kind of disturbance?

04:12.055 --> 04:14.256
A woman screaming.
A fight of some sort.

04:14.257 --> 04:17.660
No. No. Uh, no fight.
Uh...

04:17.661 --> 04:19.528
maybe the TV was on too loud.

04:19.529 --> 04:20.928
I don't hear the TV.

04:20.930 --> 04:23.332
I turned it off
when I heard you knocking.

04:23.333 --> 04:25.868
No one else was here last night
or early this morning?

04:25.869 --> 04:28.404
Just you?
Yep. Yep. Uh-huh.

04:28.405 --> 04:30.973
Just me. I-I live alone.

04:30.974 --> 04:34.143
All right, Mr. Rosen.
Thank you for your time.

04:34.144 --> 04:37.147
I will be sure to keep the TV down.

04:57.600 --> 05:00.569
This tape arrived at our embassy
in Kashfar an hour ago.

05:00.570 --> 05:02.571
"Head up.
Look into the camera."

05:02.572 --> 05:04.372
The guys with the guns are
Kashfar liberation front,

05:04.373 --> 05:06.274
a local terror group
affiliated with Al Qaeda.

05:06.275 --> 05:07.909
Most of them can't even read the koran.

05:07.910 --> 05:09.612
Thugs with an excuse to wreak havoc.

05:09.613 --> 05:10.979
"tell them what you are.

05:10.980 --> 05:12.615
Tell them what agency
you work for."

05:12.616 --> 05:14.183
what do they want?

05:14.184 --> 05:15.616
The release of Moktada Al Far.

05:15.617 --> 05:17.587
Local Leader, picked up
last year, now in Gitmo.

05:17.588 --> 05:20.255
We don't negotiate with
terrorists. They know that.

05:20.256 --> 05:22.559
"speak into the camera, you bitch."

05:22.560 --> 05:24.426
If he's not released in 48 hours,

05:24.427 --> 05:26.394
they say they'll start shooting
these guys, one per day.

05:26.395 --> 05:27.595
What's he saying?

05:27.596 --> 05:29.430
"Speak, you godless American whore.

05:29.431 --> 05:30.667
Tell them who you work for." I work
for the international red cross.

05:30.668 --> 05:32.901
I was delivering medical supplies.

05:36.406 --> 05:37.574
What about the family?

05:37.575 --> 05:39.274
We're waiting on that, sir.

05:39.275 --> 05:41.477
They deserve to know.
What are we waiting for?

05:41.478 --> 05:43.512
It's complicated.
And why is that?

05:43.513 --> 05:45.280
Because they're ours, sir.

05:45.281 --> 05:47.050
Are you saying that they're spies?

05:47.051 --> 05:50.285
They're our top C.I.A. assets
in the region, Mr. President.

05:50.286 --> 05:52.921
You want to tell me how these
two-bit junior Jihadis

05:52.922 --> 05:55.057
got their hands
on legitimate U.S. operatives?

05:55.058 --> 05:57.560
We don't know--
Well, find the hell out!

06:00.496 --> 06:02.632
I'd like a large coffee
and a bran muffin, please.

06:02.633 --> 06:03.665
Okay.

06:03.666 --> 06:05.567
No. Make that banana nut.

06:05.568 --> 06:08.070
Ah, hell, make it a doughnut.

06:08.071 --> 06:09.605
Ooh.

06:09.606 --> 06:11.640
Sorry about that.

06:11.641 --> 06:15.410
Is it okay? Did I, uh...
I short-circuit your life?

06:15.411 --> 06:18.647
My life is
still intact. Thank you.

06:18.648 --> 06:20.549
Good. Well,
how about a doughnut?

06:20.550 --> 06:22.050
The doughnuts here are amazing.

06:22.051 --> 06:24.653
They are the unsung heroes
of the pastry case.

06:24.654 --> 06:27.390
I'm good. Thank you.
Sure.

06:30.393 --> 06:31.894
So, what do you do?

06:33.396 --> 06:35.464
Okay, come on.

06:35.465 --> 06:36.933
Top-Secret
government official?

06:36.934 --> 06:39.034
C.I.A.? N.S.A.?

06:39.035 --> 06:40.268
You know, this place
is like a--

06:40.269 --> 06:42.172
like a "who's who?"
of high-powered D.C.

06:42.173 --> 06:45.507
Once, I saw the vice president
take someone else's latte.

06:45.508 --> 06:47.075
I did.

06:47.076 --> 06:48.277
Not cool.

06:48.278 --> 06:50.379
What do you do?

06:50.380 --> 06:52.147
Me? Nothing.

06:52.148 --> 06:53.515
I sell office supplies.

06:53.516 --> 06:55.951
No, you don't.
Sure, I do. Yeah.

06:55.952 --> 06:58.288
I can get you a great deal
on, uh, protractors in bulk.

06:58.289 --> 06:59.955
Hmm.

06:59.956 --> 07:01.456
I'm a tour guide.

07:01.457 --> 07:03.559
Up on that double-Decker
bus all day.

07:03.560 --> 07:05.593
Did you know there's a typo
in the inaugural address

07:05.594 --> 07:07.497
on the right wall
of the Lincoln memorial?

07:07.498 --> 07:08.664
Mnh.
Mm.

07:08.665 --> 07:10.933
That is a very impressive
fake job you have.

07:10.934 --> 07:12.901
Likewise.

07:18.508 --> 07:20.642
Hello?

07:20.643 --> 07:23.912
David Rosen just called.
He's in trouble.

07:23.913 --> 07:26.148
Her name is Wendy.
Was Wendy.

07:26.149 --> 07:27.584
Wendy Westerberg.
25 years old.

07:27.585 --> 07:30.485
Came to D.C. five years ago
from Allentown to attend G.W.

07:30.486 --> 07:33.155
Dropped out her junior year.
No social network presence.

07:33.156 --> 07:35.189
Where'd she work? So far
zero employment history.

07:35.190 --> 07:36.490
But she lives on Mintwood Place.

07:36.491 --> 07:37.594
Rent's probably about 4 grand a month.

07:37.595 --> 07:39.328
Find out how she swings it.

07:39.329 --> 07:41.629
Did you know her well? A little.
We hung out a few times.

07:41.630 --> 07:43.566
She's a regular at Mcghee's on prospect.

07:43.567 --> 07:45.133
Did you have sex with her?

07:45.134 --> 07:47.135
David, you need to tell me everything.

07:47.136 --> 07:48.471
Your life could depend on it.

07:48.472 --> 07:50.906
Yes, we had sex.

07:50.907 --> 07:53.442
It's the last thing
I remember before--

07:53.443 --> 07:55.277
I didn't kill her.

07:55.278 --> 07:56.410
I didn't kill her.

07:56.411 --> 07:57.513
What's David been up to?

07:57.514 --> 07:59.581
After losing his job
as an A.U.S.A.

07:59.582 --> 08:01.249
And being blackballed
by the justice department

08:01.250 --> 08:03.486
due to a series of embarrassing
high-profile failures,

08:03.487 --> 08:06.154
Mr. Rosen knocked on just
about every door on k street

08:06.155 --> 08:07.455
and the hill looking for work.

08:07.456 --> 08:09.290
When none of those doors opened,
he tried forming

08:09.291 --> 08:11.094
his own firm,
working out of his apartment.

08:11.095 --> 08:13.662
Made business cards and everything. Mm.

08:13.663 --> 08:16.498
I didn't even know they made,
uh, stock this thin.

08:16.499 --> 08:18.333
The phone never rang.

08:18.334 --> 08:19.635
Pupils are dilated.

08:19.636 --> 08:21.535
Also you see how they're
turned inward? Yeah.

08:21.536 --> 08:22.870
My pupils are turned inward?
You got roofied.

08:22.871 --> 08:24.307
I'd say seven, eight hours ago.

08:24.308 --> 08:27.009
No lividity or rigor mortis,
so Wendy here's pretty fresh.

08:27.010 --> 08:29.077
I'd say she died an hour ago, maybe two.

08:29.078 --> 08:31.580
Oh, thank God. Thank God.
I knew I couldn't--

08:31.581 --> 08:32.980
are we moving her?
Moving her?!

08:32.981 --> 08:34.115
If we're moving her, we gotta move now.

08:34.116 --> 08:35.416
Moving her means
the killer might go free.

08:35.417 --> 08:37.186
We're not moving her!
Everybody, hold on.

08:37.187 --> 08:38.953
David, you've been set up.

08:38.955 --> 08:40.388
Professionally, by the looks of it.

08:40.389 --> 08:42.158
Now you tell me you lied to the police.

08:42.159 --> 08:43.457
I panicked. I did.

08:43.458 --> 08:45.059
But I cannot tamper with a crime scene.

08:45.060 --> 08:46.494
We can try to help you sell the truth,

08:46.495 --> 08:48.162
try to explain away
your lies to the cops,

08:48.163 --> 08:49.563
dead woman lying in your bed,

08:49.564 --> 08:51.434
but you have to ask yourself,
will the police believe you?

08:51.435 --> 08:53.535
Will they work overtime
getting to the bottom

08:53.536 --> 08:55.536
of this mystery, or will they
go for the easy arrest?

08:55.537 --> 08:57.238
But moving the body has its own risks.

08:57.239 --> 08:58.942
It's illegal, and it makes it
Harder for the police

08:58.943 --> 09:02.911
to find the real killer,
so tell us what you want.

09:02.912 --> 09:05.047
Either way,

09:05.048 --> 09:06.883
we'll help you fight this.

09:08.484 --> 09:10.619
Do it.

09:13.189 --> 09:14.555
You got her jewelry?
Electronics, too.

09:14.556 --> 09:15.589
Laptop?
No laptop.

09:15.590 --> 09:17.226
She has one.
There's a power cord.

09:17.227 --> 09:19.561
I looked everywhere.
Fine. Break that lamp.

09:19.562 --> 09:21.497
Why? Needs to look like a "B" And "E."

09:21.498 --> 09:23.165
it won't throw off the examiners,

09:23.166 --> 09:25.601
but it'll buy us more time with the cops.

09:27.370 --> 09:29.504
What happens next?
You go to work.

09:29.505 --> 09:31.374
You have a job, right?
Yes, I have a job.

09:31.375 --> 09:33.275
No thanks to any of you.

09:33.276 --> 09:34.610
Who can tell me

09:34.611 --> 09:37.446
the three branches of government?

09:37.447 --> 09:39.482
Anybody?

09:41.951 --> 09:44.120
How about just one?

09:47.156 --> 09:48.458
David's bank statements.

09:48.459 --> 09:50.625
There was only one recent
deposit, for $5,000.

09:50.626 --> 09:53.128
Who's Eugenia Bergman?
David's grandmother.

09:53.129 --> 09:55.263
She paid his rent last month.

09:55.264 --> 09:57.366
We ruined David's life.

09:57.367 --> 09:59.202
So you go to your job
just like nothing ever happened,

09:59.203 --> 10:01.470
because, David...

10:01.471 --> 10:03.506
nothing happened.

10:05.074 --> 10:06.509
What are you looking for?

10:06.510 --> 10:08.610
We need spatter for the sheets,
for the walls.

10:08.611 --> 10:10.313
We need fresh blood.

10:12.915 --> 10:15.484
Here.

10:15.485 --> 10:16.652
You said you wanted to learn cleanup.

10:16.653 --> 10:19.255
This is cleanup.

10:24.160 --> 10:26.194
Wait! Eyes open.
You can't miss.

10:26.195 --> 10:27.363
She's already dead.

10:27.364 --> 10:30.099
It's not her I'm worried about.

10:35.471 --> 10:38.374
You're a natural.

10:52.926 --> 10:54.960
He's in a meeting. There's
nothing on the schedule.

10:54.961 --> 10:56.897
You think I make this
stuff up to amuse you?

10:56.898 --> 10:59.399
Louise, who's he meeting with?

10:59.400 --> 11:02.402
Together we will resolve this crisis.

11:02.403 --> 11:04.537
And may we become
better friends in the process.

11:04.538 --> 11:06.807
I didn't think that was
possible, Mr. Ambassador.

11:06.808 --> 11:08.808
Keep me posted.

11:08.809 --> 11:10.010
You got--Thank you.

11:12.613 --> 11:14.880
You met the ambassador
to Kashfar without me, sir?

11:14.881 --> 11:16.817
I saved you an hour
of your life--

11:16.818 --> 11:19.552
An hour I wasted trying to get
the Kashfaris to step up

11:19.553 --> 11:21.420
and take responsibility
for their own security.

11:21.421 --> 11:22.723
You didn't want me in the meeting.

11:22.724 --> 11:24.724
Can I help you with something?

11:24.725 --> 11:27.761
Is there something we need to discuss?

11:29.730 --> 11:32.366
You tell me, Cy.

11:35.736 --> 11:37.938
I guess not.

11:42.943 --> 11:44.577
I'm in!

11:44.578 --> 11:45.946
Wendy's cell was stolen at the scene,

11:45.947 --> 11:47.714
but I hacked into the cloud.

11:47.715 --> 11:49.681
There's nothing on her finances
yet, but it looks like

11:49.682 --> 11:51.717
she was uploading a bunch
of photos from her phone

11:51.718 --> 11:53.821
almost every night.
Okay, let's see 'em.

11:56.023 --> 11:57.725
Uh, these are a bunch
of pictures of, uh...

11:57.726 --> 11:59.993
men. Lots and lots
of naked--

11:59.994 --> 12:02.362
Hey.
She wasn't a fan of faces.

12:02.363 --> 12:03.862
If she was sleeping with all these guys,

12:03.863 --> 12:06.331
maybe one of them got jealous.
Is that's someone's--

12:06.332 --> 12:07.568
Hairy baby arm? No.

12:07.569 --> 12:08.702
Abby.

12:09.870 --> 12:11.638
Oh, right.

12:11.639 --> 12:13.772
The good news is it doesn't
seem like we have to worry

12:13.773 --> 12:14.940
about any doormen or cabbies.

12:14.941 --> 12:16.708
Bad news?
The bartender at Mcghee's

12:16.709 --> 12:18.977
definitely remembers Wendy and
that she left with David.

12:18.978 --> 12:20.679
Cops will be coming with a warrant.

12:20.680 --> 12:22.347
Well, they won't find anything
at his place.

12:22.348 --> 12:23.749
We were thorough. How long till
they find her at her home?

12:23.750 --> 12:25.719
Well, based on the ambient
temperature in her apartment,

12:25.720 --> 12:27.620
two days, three Max.

12:27.621 --> 12:29.689
I've got Quinn on surveillance.

12:29.690 --> 12:30.923
She's good at it.

12:30.924 --> 12:32.726
So we have at least two days
to Figure out

12:32.727 --> 12:34.394
who all these men are

12:34.395 --> 12:35.996
and if any of them
might have wanted Wendy dead.

12:35.997 --> 12:37.997
She ordered Cable. Wendy
ordered Cable. What?

12:39.699 --> 12:41.400
Cable guy came.
Her neighbor left him in.

12:41.401 --> 12:43.070
So we just went from having
two days to find out

12:43.071 --> 12:45.805
who framed David...
to having two hours.

12:47.674 --> 12:49.610
It's like a puzzle.
A thousand-Piece puzzle.

12:49.611 --> 12:51.744
Of man parts.
We don't have time,

12:51.745 --> 12:53.280
we don't have names.
We don't have numbers.

12:53.281 --> 12:54.847
What do we have?
Location stamps.

12:54.848 --> 12:56.848
Huck can pin the location
where each photo was taken.

12:56.849 --> 12:58.717
We know where they live.
We know their names.

12:58.718 --> 13:00.485
Like this guy here--
Based on the location stamp

13:00.486 --> 13:01.753
of where the photo was taken

13:01.754 --> 13:03.424
and some spring break shots on Facebook,

13:03.425 --> 13:04.924
I'm gonna say he's Chase Coleman,

13:04.925 --> 13:06.658
bike messenger for beltway courier

13:06.659 --> 13:09.027
until six months ago, when
clients' sensitive materials

13:09.028 --> 13:10.064
were leaked to the "times."

13:10.065 --> 13:11.664
Bitch put something in my drink.

13:11.665 --> 13:12.898
Stole my messenger bag.

13:12.899 --> 13:14.768
Next thing I know,
I can't get hired anywhere,

13:14.769 --> 13:16.769
and I'm selling my bike.

13:16.770 --> 13:19.739
Please take one. I have to
get rid of 500 by noon.

13:19.740 --> 13:21.074
Jason Davies.

13:21.075 --> 13:22.675
Photo was snapped at a duplex.

13:22.676 --> 13:26.279
The only other male resident
is a norm dinova, born 1928.

13:26.280 --> 13:29.282
So unless old normy keeps
himself in Amazing shape...

13:29.283 --> 13:30.782
the sad thing is I actually thought

13:30.783 --> 13:32.686
we kinda had something,
and then two weeks

13:32.687 --> 13:34.387
after we start bangin',

13:34.388 --> 13:36.456
my club's all over the frickin' news.

13:36.457 --> 13:38.290
Davies owns the Luna lounge
on 9th street.

13:38.291 --> 13:40.325
They had that big drug bust
the "post" Broke last month.

13:40.326 --> 13:41.727
They've all had some kind of thing.

13:41.728 --> 13:43.362
That guy was connected
to the massage parlor bust.

13:43.363 --> 13:44.863
Ah, this is the guy that had an affair

13:44.864 --> 13:46.298
with his daughter's
best friend--

13:46.299 --> 13:47.633
Congressional Aide, remember?

13:47.634 --> 13:49.036
Wendy wasn't just sleeping
with these guys.

13:49.037 --> 13:51.904
She was digging up dirt, exposing secrets.
But... why?

13:51.905 --> 13:54.307
Yeah. I paid her
for some stories.

13:54.308 --> 13:57.910
I mean, what's a few g's for
seven front-Page bylines, huh?

13:57.911 --> 14:00.013
I am really sorry she's dead.

14:00.014 --> 14:01.714
Good source.

14:01.715 --> 14:03.916
So Wendy--She's some kind
of story whore?

14:03.917 --> 14:06.486
She targets men with access
to sensitive information,

14:06.487 --> 14:07.953
tries to get it out of them through sex.

14:07.954 --> 14:09.588
If that doesn't work, she roofies them,

14:09.589 --> 14:11.523
digs for dirt herself, and sells
it to the highest bidder.

14:11.524 --> 14:13.759
Now we know how she made rent.
Huck says the cops

14:13.760 --> 14:15.362
are at the bar talking to the bartender.

14:15.363 --> 14:17.897
Their next stop is gonna be David.
I'm on it.

14:17.898 --> 14:20.667
So, David, what secret
is she getting from you?

14:20.668 --> 14:21.935
What did she want from you?

14:21.936 --> 14:24.570
What do you think she wanted from me?

14:24.571 --> 14:26.439
That we faked the moon landing?

14:26.440 --> 14:28.741
That a Starbucks tall is really a small?

14:28.742 --> 14:30.643
She wanted defiance, liv.

14:30.644 --> 14:34.747
She wanted to know why
a grand jury had been convened.

14:34.748 --> 14:36.049
What did you tell her?

14:36.050 --> 14:37.617
Nothing.
I didn't get the chance.

14:37.618 --> 14:39.584
Next thing I knew, I was
waking up covered in blood,

14:39.585 --> 14:40.752
framed for her murder.

14:40.753 --> 14:42.556
Because apparently I am the single most

14:42.557 --> 14:44.557
unlucky schmuck...

14:48.028 --> 14:50.663
Or because that's the way you wanted it.

14:50.664 --> 14:52.398
What?
You won.

14:52.399 --> 14:53.732
Defiance is dead, and so am I.

14:53.733 --> 14:55.067
So why isn't it enough
to ruin my career?

14:55.068 --> 14:56.601
Why do you have to throw
the rest of my life

14:56.602 --> 14:57.703
on the fire, too?

14:57.704 --> 14:58.906
Are you actually
suggesting--

14:58.907 --> 15:00.606
Unless you haven't won yet.

15:00.607 --> 15:02.474
Or maybe you didn't win until just now.

15:02.475 --> 15:04.611
Or rather until you planted
a dead girl in my bed.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.412
I'm the last loose end, aren't I?

15:06.413 --> 15:09.483
Lock me up, and you have
nothing more to worry about.

15:17.658 --> 15:20.059
I only have a minute.
He's watching me, liv.

15:20.060 --> 15:21.594
He's not watching you.

15:21.595 --> 15:23.362
The president is watching me.

15:23.363 --> 15:24.832
I feel like every time
I leave to see you,

15:24.833 --> 15:27.467
he knows where I'm going and he
adds another mark against me.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.636
Can we not talk about him?

15:31.605 --> 15:33.072
What did you need?

15:33.073 --> 15:34.975
Did you have David Rosen
framed for murder?

15:34.976 --> 15:36.676
No offense.
None taken.

15:36.677 --> 15:38.579
Why would I have David Rosen
framed for murder?

15:38.580 --> 15:40.646
To put defiance to bed once and for all.

15:40.647 --> 15:43.649
I can't say it's the worst idea
I've ever heard, but no. No?

15:43.650 --> 15:46.053
No. Defiance is over, Liv.
It died with Verna.

15:49.623 --> 15:52.859
I know things are bad
between you and Fitz, but...

15:52.860 --> 15:55.661
I-I'm sorry about
the christening, by the way.

15:55.662 --> 15:57.831
I'll have you in
and out in an hour or two.

15:57.832 --> 15:59.833
You'll barely have to see him.

16:01.635 --> 16:02.903
What?

16:05.506 --> 16:09.475
I think... he knows.

16:09.476 --> 16:11.511
I think he knows what we did.
I'm pretty sure.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.545
Liv, there's no way-- I
haven't slept in ten months.

16:13.546 --> 16:15.949
I have our last conversation
on a loop in my head

16:15.950 --> 16:17.483
all night every night.

16:17.484 --> 16:19.720
I think he knows what we did, Cyrus.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.058
My minute is up.
I have to get back.

16:25.059 --> 16:26.692
Are you--
I'm fine.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.631
Cyrus.
What?

16:31.965 --> 16:34.001
Defiance isn't ever going to be over.

16:44.823 --> 16:46.425
Where are we?

16:50.395 --> 16:52.497
We just ran out of time.

17:05.823 --> 17:06.821
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

17:06.823 --> 17:07.989
You kiss?

17:07.990 --> 17:09.726
You give that monkey a kiss?

17:09.727 --> 17:12.060
Give daddy a kiss?

17:12.061 --> 17:14.797
What do you want?

17:14.798 --> 17:16.967
- is he in there?
- Shh. It's baby time.

17:16.968 --> 17:19.468
He can play with that baby for hours.

17:19.469 --> 17:21.038
I don't know how he does it.
I don't have the patience.

17:21.039 --> 17:22.905
Me, either.

17:22.906 --> 17:24.540
Mellie.

17:26.542 --> 17:28.544
Something has to be done.

17:28.545 --> 17:30.413
He can't keep this up.

17:30.414 --> 17:31.748
What do you propose we do, Cyrus?

17:31.749 --> 17:33.382
I have tried everything.

17:33.383 --> 17:34.852
Right now I'm just trying
to keep him focused and calm

17:34.853 --> 17:36.619
so that he can run the country.

17:36.620 --> 17:38.989
Sometimes I think that baby is
all that's holding him together.

17:38.990 --> 17:41.425
He knows about defiance.

17:44.061 --> 17:45.728
No.

17:45.729 --> 17:47.563
No. This is about Olivia.

17:47.564 --> 17:49.066
Something happened, and they're done,

17:49.067 --> 17:50.633
and he just needs time to adjust.

17:50.634 --> 17:52.335
That's what I thought, too.

17:52.336 --> 17:55.504
But it's been almost a year.
This isn't just about Olivia.

17:55.505 --> 17:57.840
So he's drinking more than usual.

17:57.841 --> 17:59.674
We can handle that.
I am handling that.

17:59.675 --> 18:01.645
He could bathe in scotch for all I care.

18:01.646 --> 18:03.379
That's not the problem.

18:03.380 --> 18:07.516
The problem is, he's not
using me like he's supposed to.

18:07.517 --> 18:09.384
I'm the guard dog, I'm the bad cop,

18:09.385 --> 18:10.785
I'm the Dragon that gets released.

18:10.786 --> 18:12.656
I run the meetings and make the calls

18:12.657 --> 18:14.490
and help him come to decisions.

18:14.491 --> 18:15.791
Except I'm not.

18:15.792 --> 18:18.861
He's isolating himself.
He's shutting me out.

18:18.862 --> 18:21.530
He's running for the country,
for real, on his own.

18:21.531 --> 18:23.367
He doesn't trust us, Mellie.

18:23.368 --> 18:25.434
I've tried talking to him.

18:25.435 --> 18:27.603
Try again.

18:27.604 --> 18:30.439
I will. After I get him through
your daughter's christening.

18:30.440 --> 18:32.408
Whose brilliant Idea was that?

18:32.409 --> 18:34.944
Olivia Pope as godmother?
Mellie...

18:34.945 --> 18:38.481
It's not just my... problem here.

18:38.482 --> 18:41.284
If I'm right, if he knows
about defiance,

18:41.285 --> 18:42.919
it's both of us he doesn't trust.

18:42.920 --> 18:45.588
And if he doesn't trust us
when he gets tired and thirsty

18:45.589 --> 18:47.323
and goes looking for water,

18:47.324 --> 18:49.592
he's going to drink
from someone else's trough.

18:49.593 --> 18:51.360
He needs somewhere to lean,

18:51.361 --> 18:52.996
he's going to lean on someone else.

18:52.997 --> 18:55.364
He's going to start trusting
someone else,

18:55.365 --> 18:58.000
and once that happens,
someone else is going to be

18:58.001 --> 19:00.504
riding our horse across the finish line.

19:06.610 --> 19:09.512
Um... boo!

19:09.513 --> 19:11.481
What do you see? Hmm?

19:11.482 --> 19:12.815
Um... boo!

19:12.816 --> 19:14.817
And back to our story that led the hour.

19:14.818 --> 19:16.753
The White House has issued
a statement regarding

19:16.754 --> 19:19.322
the four American Aide workers
who went missing

19:19.323 --> 19:21.490
near Kashfar City yesterday morning.

19:21.491 --> 19:23.526
And while some reports
suggest the Americans

19:23.527 --> 19:26.062
may have been captured by rebel forces,

19:26.063 --> 19:28.664
the White House is denying
those claims, saying--

19:30.467 --> 19:32.936
Any news?
Nothing.

19:34.338 --> 19:36.572
Is David gonna go down for this?

19:36.573 --> 19:39.342
Not if I can help it.

19:39.343 --> 19:40.843
Abby.

19:40.844 --> 19:44.314
Are you--
I'm fine. I'm--I'm fine.

19:49.386 --> 19:50.586
Work helps.

19:50.587 --> 19:52.488
So does exercise--

19:52.489 --> 19:54.524
Stuff that numbs you keeps you
from thinking too much.

19:54.525 --> 19:57.360
Dating also helps, but...

19:57.361 --> 19:59.729
it also helps to remember
that he hates you,

19:59.730 --> 20:01.498
and it helps to try to hate him, too.

20:01.499 --> 20:04.333
And that works for you?

20:04.334 --> 20:06.869
I was talking about you and David.

20:08.505 --> 20:10.406
Someone keeps calling Wendy.

20:10.407 --> 20:12.407
I've been monitoring her
cell phone activity just in case

20:12.408 --> 20:14.743
anything interesting came up,
and today something did--

20:14.744 --> 20:16.544
Four calls, all from the same line.

20:16.545 --> 20:18.346
Can we track the number?
I already did.

20:18.347 --> 20:19.916
They're coming from
the joint chiefs' office.

20:19.917 --> 20:21.418
In the Pentagon.

20:23.620 --> 20:26.455
It's a fishing expedition.
They got nothing--No case.

20:26.456 --> 20:27.857
They're grasping at air.

20:27.858 --> 20:30.426
So you? You do exactly what was
done to you as a A.U.S.A.

20:30.427 --> 20:31.928
Guy comes in with his lawyer, clams up,

20:31.929 --> 20:33.429
flat-out refuses
to play ball.

20:33.430 --> 20:35.464
Probably annoyed you to no end, right?

20:35.465 --> 20:38.567
Now see, that's how we do this.

20:38.568 --> 20:41.037
Say nothing, do nothing,
admit to nothing.

20:41.038 --> 20:43.573
Let me do the talking,
and we'll be fine.

20:44.574 --> 20:46.409
Good. Just like that.

20:46.410 --> 20:48.677
You got it.

20:48.678 --> 20:49.880
These past several months
have been very difficult

20:49.881 --> 20:51.447
for you, haven't they, David?

20:51.448 --> 20:52.883
You don't have to answer that.
I mean, if I were fired,

20:52.884 --> 20:54.617
gosh, I'd be so frustrated.

20:54.618 --> 20:56.619
And not just frustrated, but angry.

20:56.620 --> 20:59.722
The kind of anger that just
sits there and doesn't go away.

20:59.723 --> 21:00.889
Are you angry, David?

21:00.890 --> 21:02.524
You don't have to answer that, either.

21:02.525 --> 21:04.025
In fact, my client doesn't have
to answer any--

21:04.026 --> 21:05.393
Do you remember the case
I was working on

21:05.394 --> 21:06.530
when I got fired, Mike?

21:06.531 --> 21:08.564
We referred to it internally
as defiance.

21:08.565 --> 21:11.301
What are you doing? Defiance is the county
in Ohio that elected our president.

21:11.302 --> 21:13.502
Not by an honest accounting of votes,

21:13.503 --> 21:16.372
the case alleged, but through
an illegal manipulation--

21:16.373 --> 21:17.505
Voting machines.

21:17.506 --> 21:18.973
Okay, I need to, um,
speak with m--

21:18.974 --> 21:20.708
It's a bold claim, and I say "Claim"...

21:20.709 --> 21:22.043
because it never
saw the inside of a courtroom.

21:22.044 --> 21:23.513
You wanna know why?
David, please.

21:23.514 --> 21:26.482
Because I was an idiot.
Are you an idiot, too, Mike?

21:26.483 --> 21:29.885
Your theory of the crime
is that I, David Rosen,

21:29.886 --> 21:32.054
the man whose job you're now occupying,

21:32.055 --> 21:33.690
whose chair you're now sitting in,

21:33.691 --> 21:36.492
your longtime colleague
with extensive legal training

21:36.493 --> 21:38.828
and no prior record whatsoever

21:38.829 --> 21:40.396
picked up a woman at a bar

21:40.397 --> 21:41.696
and then brought her to my place,

21:41.697 --> 21:43.333
where I promptly stabbed her to death.

21:43.334 --> 21:45.434
Because that's what I am--
a stabber.

21:45.435 --> 21:47.337
Give me a knife and I'll stab anything.

21:47.338 --> 21:49.004
Oh, how I love to stab.

21:49.005 --> 21:51.007
Which is why, when I finished
stabbing her in my apartment,

21:51.008 --> 21:53.409
I carried the body to her place

21:53.410 --> 21:55.411
and stabbed it some more.

21:55.412 --> 21:57.880
Why settle for a crime of passion

21:57.881 --> 22:00.416
when a burglary gone wrong
is so easy to stage?

22:00.417 --> 22:01.916
You were the last person
She was seen with.

22:01.917 --> 22:03.485
By a bartender who's routinely drunk

22:03.486 --> 22:04.821
for the last two-Thirds
of his shift.

22:04.822 --> 22:06.522
Trust me, I'm a regular.

22:06.523 --> 22:10.025
Which in evidentiary terms means
you have absolutely nothing.

22:10.026 --> 22:13.496
So if you want to keep this job,
stay in This nice Office,

22:13.497 --> 22:15.998
look out at that beautiful
view of the mall every day

22:15.999 --> 22:18.634
and put yourself on the fast
track to Attorney General,

22:18.635 --> 22:20.436
don't be an idiot.

22:20.437 --> 22:24.440
Leave me alone
and forget this ever happened.

22:24.441 --> 22:26.374
Because only an idiot pursues cases

22:26.375 --> 22:27.744
he stands no chance of winning.

22:27.745 --> 22:30.312
I learned that the hard way.
If I were you,

22:30.313 --> 22:31.947
I'd spare myself that shame.

22:31.948 --> 22:33.717
And since I'm under no legal obligation

22:33.718 --> 22:35.985
to continue this
bizarre and humiliating visit

22:35.986 --> 22:37.454
to my old office...

22:38.922 --> 22:40.356
I'll leave you to it.

22:42.359 --> 22:43.859
Well...

22:43.860 --> 22:45.761
That was fun.

22:45.762 --> 22:48.597
We should, uh, do it again soon.

22:48.598 --> 22:50.700
I expect we will.

22:57.307 --> 22:59.775
I'm looking for a captain Jacob Ballard.

22:59.776 --> 23:01.443
You found him.

23:01.444 --> 23:03.979
You could have just called me...

23:03.980 --> 23:05.513
or run into me accidentally
at the coffee place.

23:05.514 --> 23:07.282
You didn't have to come
all the way down to the Pentagon

23:07.283 --> 23:08.552
just to ask me out.

23:08.553 --> 23:10.287
That's a hike.

23:18.705 --> 23:20.906
She was stabbed to death?
Oh, my God.

23:20.907 --> 23:23.909
Do they know--
Who did it? No.

23:23.910 --> 23:27.662
No idea.
Was she working on a story?

23:27.663 --> 23:29.365
Maybe trying to get
some information from you?

23:29.366 --> 23:31.966
Are you a detective?
No.

23:31.967 --> 23:33.502
'cause you sound like a detective.

23:33.503 --> 23:35.503
I'm not a detective.

23:35.504 --> 23:37.806
Well, then why are you asking me
detective-like questions?

23:37.807 --> 23:39.507
I can't tell you that.
Ahh.

23:39.508 --> 23:41.543
I know Wendy traded in secrets.

23:41.544 --> 23:42.912
Was there anything she had on you,

23:42.913 --> 23:45.280
anything you might have leaked to her?

23:45.281 --> 23:47.549
So even though you're not a detective,

23:47.550 --> 23:49.584
I'm some kind of suspect here?

23:49.585 --> 23:50.818
At this point,

23:50.819 --> 23:52.988
I think everyone
in her phone log is a suspect.

23:55.357 --> 23:56.657
She came to me a month ago

23:56.658 --> 23:58.358
with some information
she wanted to sell.

23:58.359 --> 24:00.627
I didn't take it very seriously
until a couple of days ago

24:00.628 --> 24:01.862
when something I was working on

24:01.863 --> 24:03.463
Suddenly made
that information pertinent.

24:03.464 --> 24:04.533
What were you working on?

24:04.534 --> 24:06.334
My turn.

24:06.335 --> 24:07.468
Classified.

24:07.469 --> 24:09.571
Unlike you, I don't have the choice

24:09.572 --> 24:11.472
about what I can and cannot say.

24:11.473 --> 24:13.842
Were you going to buy
the information she was selling?

24:15.945 --> 24:18.546
I work at intel
for the joint chiefs of staff.

24:18.547 --> 24:21.583
We are not in the business
of paying for information.

24:21.584 --> 24:23.452
Even though she knew
something you didn't?

24:23.453 --> 24:26.788
An assumption I can neither
confirm nor deny.

24:26.789 --> 24:28.891
By the way, shouldn't
the police have her phone log?

24:28.892 --> 24:30.326
How do you have it, too?

24:31.393 --> 24:33.027
I can't tell.
Can't tell me.

24:34.463 --> 24:36.598
Well, since you're not
able to tell me anything,

24:36.599 --> 24:38.766
and I'm not able to tell you anything,

24:38.767 --> 24:40.401
I guess we're done here.

24:40.402 --> 24:41.836
I guess we are.

24:41.837 --> 24:43.604
Unless you'd like
to go out to dinner with me.

24:43.605 --> 24:45.574
Then we can not talk
about all sorts of things.

24:45.575 --> 24:48.676
Sorry.
I don't think so.

24:48.677 --> 24:51.546
You sure?
I can be very unhelpful.

24:51.547 --> 24:54.250
Oh, I'm sure you can.

25:00.555 --> 25:01.888
We can't get human intelligence

25:01.889 --> 25:03.690
on where the hostages are being held.

25:03.691 --> 25:05.459
The guys they grabbed
were our eyes and ears

25:05.460 --> 25:07.828
on the ground there.
But the N.S.A. picked up chatter

25:07.829 --> 25:09.529
from a small city in the northeast

25:09.530 --> 25:10.964
after a recon overflight, we pinpointed

25:10.965 --> 25:12.635
the building where the hostages
are being held.

25:12.636 --> 25:15.271
Degree of confidence? High. These K.L.F.
Guys like to talk.

25:18.374 --> 25:19.674
Send in a S.E.A.L. team.

25:19.675 --> 25:22.010
Mr. President,
can we just take a breath

25:22.011 --> 25:23.544
to consider other options?

25:23.545 --> 25:25.414
It'd be faster to let
the Kashfari military handle it.

25:25.415 --> 25:27.582
I wouldn't trust them to watch my dog.

25:27.583 --> 25:29.752
And no one in Their government
can even know about this.

25:29.753 --> 25:31.786
If I may, s--
Enough.

25:31.787 --> 25:33.554
How soon can we dispatch a team?

25:33.555 --> 25:35.424
They're locked and loaded,
sir, just awaiting your go.

25:35.425 --> 25:38.294
Mr. President, please, a word?

25:41.363 --> 25:42.696
There's a way that this works.

25:42.697 --> 25:44.364
If you pulled me out of the sit room

25:44.365 --> 25:46.233
to give me a civics lesson,
or to tell me I'm ticking--

25:46.234 --> 25:47.534
Your job is to process
all of the various opinions--

25:47.535 --> 25:49.236
Here we go. Should I
get a notebook and pencil?

25:49.237 --> 25:50.873
No, sir. I simply--
Then make your point.

25:50.874 --> 25:53.374
You've been isolating me,
shutting me out.

25:53.375 --> 25:56.744
I've been waiting to address it with
you until-- Make your point, Cyrus.

25:56.745 --> 25:59.480
You can't do this alone.
No one can.

25:59.481 --> 26:02.517
You're my bulldog, my Dragon.

26:02.518 --> 26:04.552
Is that today's rehashed speech?

26:04.553 --> 26:06.420
You're isolating me,
and it's bad business.

26:06.421 --> 26:08.390
It's bad for the country.
It's bad...

26:08.391 --> 26:10.725
for me, Mr. President.

26:10.726 --> 26:12.927
It makes it very hard for me
to do my job.

26:12.928 --> 26:15.530
And my job is simply
to make yours easier,

26:15.531 --> 26:18.433
So, please, will you let-- Are we
done discussing your hurt feelings?

26:18.434 --> 26:20.336
Because I would like to get back
to saving American lives.

26:20.337 --> 26:21.836
Can we do that?
Will you let us?

26:21.837 --> 26:23.404
Yes, Mr. President.
Excellent.

26:23.405 --> 26:25.840
Now, what's your take?

26:25.841 --> 26:27.508
It's my opinion

26:27.509 --> 26:29.345
that it's too early
to send in a s.E.A.L. Team.

26:29.346 --> 26:30.745
We need to be careful.

26:30.746 --> 26:33.848
We need to contain this situation.

26:33.849 --> 26:38.453
Allow the Kashfaris some time
to gather intel on the ground,

26:38.454 --> 26:41.456
so we can be better prepared
when and if the time comes

26:41.457 --> 26:43.524
to pull the trigger on an extraction.

26:43.525 --> 26:45.993
Fine. We'll hold off.

26:45.994 --> 26:47.628
For now.

26:47.629 --> 26:50.398
All right.

26:50.399 --> 26:52.967
Great.

26:52.968 --> 26:54.669
We're done.

26:54.670 --> 26:57.373
Very good, Mr. President.

27:04.246 --> 27:06.447
She was on to
something big--Wendy.

27:06.448 --> 27:08.282
Ahh.

27:08.283 --> 27:09.883
A high-level military
intelligence officer

27:09.884 --> 27:11.487
was desperate to talk to her
the day she died.

27:11.488 --> 27:12.820
He wouldn't tell me why,

27:12.821 --> 27:14.488
which means she was on to something big.

27:14.489 --> 27:16.258
And I'm willing to bet
whatever she was on to

27:16.259 --> 27:18.393
is why she's dead now.
It's why you were framed.

27:18.394 --> 27:19.994
How much do I owe you?
What?

27:19.995 --> 27:21.964
For your services.
Or did you take a commission

27:21.965 --> 27:23.798
when I sold my soul to the devil?

27:23.799 --> 27:26.801
Your troubles aren't over.
Not by a long shot.

27:26.802 --> 27:28.436
But you and I are.

27:28.437 --> 27:30.839
Everything you've ever done
for as long as I've known you

27:30.840 --> 27:33.875
has been tailor-made
to hurt me, so I'm done.

27:33.876 --> 27:36.444
I'm done with you,
I'm done with your people.

27:36.445 --> 27:38.246
So how much, Olivia?
David--

27:38.247 --> 27:39.948
How much?!

27:43.452 --> 27:45.454
You can't afford me.

28:40.069 --> 28:41.869
Mint?

28:41.870 --> 28:43.203
What?

28:43.204 --> 28:45.372
Mint.
You smell like alcohol.

28:45.373 --> 28:47.742
You're Ella's godfather.
We're going to her christening.

28:47.743 --> 28:49.911
You can't smell like alcohol.

28:54.382 --> 28:56.083
You know, don't you?

28:56.084 --> 28:58.320
About defiance.

28:59.854 --> 29:02.990
You feel betrayed, and I am sorry.

29:02.991 --> 29:05.225
It was--There was a decision
made in a moment--

29:05.226 --> 29:06.760
I don't want to discuss it.

29:06.761 --> 29:08.996
You deserve to be president, Fitz.

29:08.997 --> 29:10.864
No, I don't.

29:10.865 --> 29:12.866
But that doesn't matter,
because here I am.

29:12.867 --> 29:14.801
Fitz, if you had been a part of
that conversation-- But I wasn't.

29:14.802 --> 29:16.738
No one asked me, and I said
I don't want to discuss it.

29:16.739 --> 29:18.340
No, you just want to drink.

29:22.344 --> 29:23.844
You're shutting Cyrus out.

29:23.845 --> 29:25.813
He's not stupid.

29:25.814 --> 29:27.814
He knows he's on the outside.
He's your chief of staff.

29:27.815 --> 29:29.117
If you're gonna try to tell me
how to run the country

29:29.118 --> 29:30.718
that you helped steal
for me--

29:30.719 --> 29:32.853
I was going to say you're right.

29:32.854 --> 29:34.855
You're right to shut Cyrus out.

29:34.856 --> 29:37.158
You are right.

29:41.329 --> 29:43.732
It was Cyrus.

29:45.000 --> 29:49.169
Cyrus... pushed
and he plotted and he planned

29:49.170 --> 29:53.774
and he dug his heels in, and he made us.

29:53.775 --> 29:56.110
I wanted you to be president.
I did.

29:56.111 --> 30:01.448
I am unashamed of how much
I wanted the White House for us.

30:01.449 --> 30:03.884
And I can be an animal if I need to be.

30:03.885 --> 30:06.053
I'm proud to rip the flesh off anyone

30:06.054 --> 30:08.422
who comes between me and...

30:11.159 --> 30:15.330
Cyrus... stole the election.

30:17.365 --> 30:21.835
He decided, and he got Liv on board

30:21.836 --> 30:24.805
and Verna and... me.

30:24.806 --> 30:26.774
He got me.

30:26.775 --> 30:30.010
It was Cyrus.

30:30.011 --> 30:32.479
I'm not trying to excuse what I did.

30:32.480 --> 30:34.815
I'm not trying to say
I didn't have a part.

30:34.816 --> 30:36.884
I'm just saying you're right.

30:36.885 --> 30:38.786
To shut him out.

30:38.787 --> 30:42.956
To not trust him.

30:42.957 --> 30:45.326
I think you're right.

30:47.228 --> 30:49.164
Because...

30:50.799 --> 30:52.967
It was Cyrus.

30:58.973 --> 31:00.974
You have me.

31:00.975 --> 31:03.244
You can trust me.

31:13.121 --> 31:17.357
I'm thinking of sending
an extraction team into Kashfar.

31:17.358 --> 31:19.761
I need those guys to come back alive.

31:22.163 --> 31:24.933
I think you should trust your instincts.

31:27.902 --> 31:30.704
I need to know
I'm making the right call.

31:30.705 --> 31:34.775
You are the president.
Any call you make is right.

31:34.776 --> 31:36.410
And if it doesn't work out,

31:36.411 --> 31:38.412
we'll figure out what the next step is.

31:38.413 --> 31:40.782
We can do this.

31:54.863 --> 31:56.865
It's gonna be all right.

32:13.381 --> 32:15.883
Hi, Darling.

32:15.884 --> 32:18.785
Don't worry. The ceremony
will be short and sweet.

32:18.786 --> 32:21.388
They abbreviate for the godless.
Call the secretary.

32:21.389 --> 32:23.824
Tell him to send in
the S.E.A.L. team.

32:23.825 --> 32:25.093
Do it before the ceremony.

32:25.094 --> 32:27.794
I thought we agreed
to take a breath on this.

32:27.795 --> 32:29.162
Take as many breaths as you like,

32:29.163 --> 32:30.865
then recount them in your memoirs.

32:30.866 --> 32:33.101
Call in that S.E.A.L. team.
Now.

32:39.841 --> 32:42.743
Hey, James. How are ya?

32:50.852 --> 32:53.119
How fortunate is baby Ella?

32:53.120 --> 32:54.720
To have such fine examples of leadership

32:54.721 --> 32:56.357
and commitment to our lord and savior.

32:56.358 --> 33:00.694
Ella Margaret Novak Beene...

33:00.695 --> 33:03.897
I baptize you
in the name of the father...

33:03.898 --> 33:05.700

33:14.275 --> 33:16.810
Amen.

33:16.811 --> 33:18.046
Ella won't remember today.

33:18.047 --> 33:20.147
She won't remember
all of you cooing over her.

33:20.148 --> 33:22.450
She won't remember the president
of the United States

33:22.451 --> 33:24.084
holding her.

33:24.085 --> 33:26.485
I hope to God she won't remember
the temper tantrum I threw

33:26.486 --> 33:28.022
when I found out the Japanese peonies

33:28.023 --> 33:30.123
would not arrive in time
for the ceremony.

33:30.124 --> 33:32.693
It is, however, etched
deeply into my memories.

33:34.796 --> 33:37.898
She won't remember, but I hope
all of you will remind her.

33:37.899 --> 33:39.801
Not about the absence of the peonies,

33:39.802 --> 33:43.804
but about how she was
surrounded by love.

33:45.740 --> 33:48.475
To Ella. To family.

33:48.476 --> 33:50.277
Thank you.

35:45.646 --> 35:47.114
I made a mistake.

35:47.115 --> 35:48.749
We both did.

35:48.750 --> 35:50.751
It won't happen again.

35:53.388 --> 35:56.024
I was talking about defiance.

36:00.728 --> 36:04.131
That wasn't a mistake.

36:04.132 --> 36:05.400
That was betrayal.

36:07.635 --> 36:08.969
We are done

36:08.970 --> 36:11.070
I may not be able to control
my erections around you,

36:11.071 --> 36:12.607
but that does not mean I want you.

36:12.608 --> 36:15.576
We... are done.

36:17.812 --> 36:21.449
Sir, it's a go. Right now.

36:30.391 --> 36:32.425
First floor secure.
Advancing towards target.

36:32.426 --> 36:34.060
Based on heat-sensored
satellite imagery,

36:34.061 --> 36:35.928
we're expecting anywhere
from five to eight

36:35.929 --> 36:37.532
enemy combatants guarding the hostages

36:37.533 --> 36:40.100
in the northwest corner
of the second floor.

36:40.101 --> 36:41.803
Centcom, we've reached the target.

36:41.804 --> 36:44.137
Alpha, you're a go.

36:44.138 --> 36:47.541
Fire in the hole!

36:47.542 --> 36:48.643
This is it.

36:52.847 --> 36:54.749
Whiskey tango foxtrot!
It's empty!

36:54.750 --> 36:56.116
No hostages.

36:56.117 --> 36:57.483
What the hell?
All clear.

36:57.484 --> 36:58.751
Alpha Bravo ten, awaiting orders.

36:58.752 --> 37:00.019
Tell them to abort.
Centcom, do you copy?

37:00.020 --> 37:01.122
Charlie Mike?
This could be a trap.

37:01.123 --> 37:02.989
Get them out of there now!

37:02.990 --> 37:04.491
Centcom, abort.
Do you copy?

37:04.492 --> 37:06.393
Copy. Relaying order now.

37:06.394 --> 37:08.895
"E" and "E"! Echo Echo, go, go, go!
Move, move!

37:08.896 --> 37:10.630
Stay on your six.

37:10.631 --> 37:11.730
Alpha Bravo, go two.

37:12.734 --> 37:14.434
What the hell just happened?

37:14.435 --> 37:16.838
How did we send a s.E.A.L. Team
to the wrong address?

37:16.839 --> 37:18.371
We didn't.
How did this happen?

37:18.372 --> 37:21.408
Permission to clear
the room, Mr. President?

37:21.409 --> 37:22.677
Go ahead.

37:32.854 --> 37:35.922
Sir... we have a mole.

37:35.923 --> 37:37.891
Damn it.

37:37.892 --> 37:39.024
I'll get the director
of national intelligence

37:39.025 --> 37:40.126
over here right now.

37:40.127 --> 37:41.762
We'll start an internal investigation.

37:41.763 --> 37:43.096
Hold off.
What?

37:43.097 --> 37:44.764
Hold off.
But, sir--

37:44.765 --> 37:46.134
Are you having trouble hearing lately?

37:46.135 --> 37:48.935
When I say "Stand down,"
I mean stand down.

37:48.936 --> 37:50.437
We've got a mole.

37:50.438 --> 37:52.106
I need to think about how to proceed.

37:52.107 --> 37:53.773
Sir--

37:53.774 --> 37:55.543
I need to figure out who I can trust.

38:03.384 --> 38:04.885
Since when do you knock?

38:04.886 --> 38:06.887
I'm sorry.

38:06.888 --> 38:08.522
Really? For which part?

38:08.523 --> 38:10.424
All of it.

38:11.726 --> 38:13.827
Don't be. I'm fine.

38:13.828 --> 38:15.829
David-- I'm fine. Never been better.

38:15.830 --> 38:17.062
Found my calling--

38:17.063 --> 38:18.799
Molding the young minds of America.

38:20.968 --> 38:22.937
Good night, Abby.

38:44.892 --> 38:46.126
What is that?

38:46.127 --> 38:47.727
Wendy's flash drive.

38:47.728 --> 38:49.030
She had just started downloading

38:49.031 --> 38:51.064
my defiance files when she died.

38:51.065 --> 38:53.067
Whoever killed her probably
didn't even know it was there.

38:53.068 --> 38:54.802
Take a look.

38:55.970 --> 38:58.739
Click on the one titled
"Albatross."

39:00.875 --> 39:03.944
There's over 350 pages
of high-Level,

39:03.945 --> 39:07.013
classified military intelligence
on there.

39:07.014 --> 39:09.816
Nuclear missile locations.
Black sites.

39:09.817 --> 39:13.486
The coordinates for
the president's wartime bunkers.

39:13.487 --> 39:15.522
There's six of them in the country,

39:15.523 --> 39:17.024
just in case they ever
ask it on "Jeopardy!"

39:17.025 --> 39:19.025
This is a major security breach.

39:19.026 --> 39:21.861
No civilian should have
their hands on this stuff.

39:21.862 --> 39:24.698
I think this is your something big.

39:24.699 --> 39:26.800
I would love to forget
about this whole thing.

39:26.801 --> 39:28.703
I would love to forget I ever met Wendy.

39:28.704 --> 39:31.137
I'd love to forget I ever met you.

39:31.138 --> 39:33.840
But now... I need you,

39:33.841 --> 39:36.876
because I'd be really
terrible at prison.

39:36.877 --> 39:39.045
That's if I'm lucky enough
to live that long.

39:39.046 --> 39:41.014
You're not just here for you.

39:41.015 --> 39:43.149
I know you, David.
This is about justice.

39:43.150 --> 39:44.986
This is about dusting off the white hat

39:44.987 --> 39:48.422
and putting it back where it belongs.

40:10.978 --> 40:13.013
Baby's asleep.

40:13.014 --> 40:15.949
Thought we could pick up
where we left off yesterday.

40:15.950 --> 40:17.017
No.

40:17.018 --> 40:17.952
Fitz--
No.

40:17.953 --> 40:19.953
No. No.
Come on. It'll be fun.

40:19.954 --> 40:22.889
No. No. Mellie, damn it, I said no!

40:24.859 --> 40:27.460
I'm sorry.

40:27.461 --> 40:28.962
I'm sorry.

40:28.963 --> 40:31.699
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

40:33.968 --> 40:35.970
I'm sorry.

41:28.422 --> 41:30.890
Hello?
It's Olivia Pope.

41:30.891 --> 41:32.093
Ah, I thought you might call.

41:32.094 --> 41:33.827
Oh, yeah? Why is that?

41:33.828 --> 41:35.594
Because that's what beautiful women do

41:35.595 --> 41:36.929
when I invite them
to have dinner with me.

41:36.930 --> 41:38.899
You're assuming I called to accept.

41:38.900 --> 41:40.934
I'm a high-ranking
intelligence officer.

41:40.935 --> 41:42.669
They train me to read people.

41:42.670 --> 41:44.939
Where should we go?
Got any ideas?

41:44.940 --> 41:46.506
There's a quiet little

41:46.507 --> 41:49.809
French place on Connecticut
everyone's raving about.

41:49.810 --> 41:51.045
Quiet's not really my thing.

41:51.046 --> 41:53.880
No? I had four brothers and two sisters.

41:53.881 --> 41:57.450
Quiet, uh...
quiet freaks me out.

41:57.451 --> 41:59.919
So what is your thing?

41:59.920 --> 42:01.855
Honestly?

42:01.856 --> 42:03.957
People watching.

42:03.958 --> 42:06.793
It's got its own category on Zagat.

42:06.794 --> 42:08.395
So does late-night dancing,

42:08.396 --> 42:10.697
but I'm guessing
that's not in the cards.

42:10.698 --> 42:12.465
Depends how much wine I drink.

42:12.466 --> 42:13.833
Really?

42:13.834 --> 42:16.036
Well, then maybe we should
go to that French place.

42:16.037 --> 42:19.507
How does, uh... how's 8:00
on Friday sound?

42:21.675 --> 42:23.576
8:00 on Friday
sounds perfect.

42:23.577 --> 42:25.912
Good.

42:25.913 --> 42:27.815
Well, I will see you then, Olivia Pope.

42:27.816 --> 42:30.384
See you then, Captain Ballard.
