00:01.777 --> 00:03.276
Hey, guys!
Paige and Frankie here.

00:03.312 --> 00:04.722

have to study for a test again.

01:59.711 --> 02:01.486
Did you guys hear
what happened in Studio J?

02:07.344 --> 02:09.319
Uh-oh. I hope they're
not trying to scare us,

02:09.354 --> 02:11.688
because I am not good with...

02:11.724 --> 02:12.639
Both: Surprise!

02:12.674 --> 02:13.656
- (screams)
- (punch)

02:13.691 --> 02:15.050
Ohhhh!

02:15.085 --> 02:17.227
You got your own studio!

02:17.262 --> 02:19.796
(rock music playing)

02:25.770 --> 02:30.665
<i>Hello! I'm sorry I have to send
in this pre-recorded video,</i>

02:30.700 --> 02:33.284
<i>but I'm busy right now doing...</i>

02:33.320 --> 02:35.312
<i>(dubbed):
Literally anything else.</i>

02:37.023 --> 02:38.849
<i>Congratulations...</i>

02:38.884 --> 02:40.308
<i>(dubbed): Bizaardvark?</i>

02:40.343 --> 02:41.776
<i>Uch, really?</i>

02:44.072 --> 02:48.383
<i>On reaching 100,000 subscriber.</i>

02:48.418 --> 02:51.261

02:55.551 --> 02:58.785
Frankie! We hit
100,000 subscribers!

02:58.820 --> 03:00.253
No-look high-five!

03:01.957 --> 03:03.690
Bernie/Amelia: Woooo!

03:03.725 --> 03:06.009
(rock music playing)

03:06.044 --> 03:09.512
Thanks, guys!
You're the best friends ever!

03:09.547 --> 03:11.267
Could've stayed
to help us clean up, though.

03:15.112 --> 03:17.362
What are you doin'?

03:17.398 --> 03:19.442
Oh, I just grabbed some stuff
to decorate our new studio.

03:19.466 --> 03:22.342
Check it out, it's... it's Benjamin
Franklin boxing a dinosaur.

03:22.377 --> 03:26.262
Get it? 'Cause it's weird?

03:26.297 --> 03:28.665
Oh. But we didn't
even talk about it,

03:28.700 --> 03:29.869
and I thought we'd ask our fans

03:29.893 --> 03:31.359
how to decorate our studio.

03:31.395 --> 03:33.072
Well, I mean, this is our
studio, not our fans'.

03:33.096 --> 03:34.070
But we wouldn't be here
without them.

03:34.106 --> 03:36.881
Yeah, I guess, but... I don't
know, I... I just disagree.

03:36.916 --> 03:38.375
And I disagree with you.

03:38.410 --> 03:39.410
Oh.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.375
Okay, not to worry.
We're prepared for this.

03:45.533 --> 03:46.533
(beeps)

03:51.290 --> 03:52.930
(Frankie's voice):
<i>Are you Yeti for this?</i>

03:56.353 --> 04:00.088
Behold! Paige and Frankie's Five-Step
Disagreement Resolution Process.

04:00.123 --> 04:02.274
Written in the year
of our Yeti 2012.

04:04.027 --> 04:06.152
To end our very first argument:

04:06.188 --> 04:09.514
"Where should
we keep the scroll?"

04:09.549 --> 04:11.311
It took a lot of wiring,
and all my allowance,

04:11.335 --> 04:12.775
but I think
we made the right choice.

04:18.742 --> 04:21.868
Amelia? Hi, I'm Rachel Massey!

04:21.903 --> 04:24.587
I know who you are, you're class
president and homecomin' chair.

04:24.622 --> 04:27.215
And founder of the
Impressive Handshakers Club.

04:29.377 --> 04:31.978
Wow.

04:32.013 --> 04:34.372
Yeah, I get that a lot.

04:34.407 --> 04:36.917
Anyway, I'm organizing
a big school fundraiser

04:36.952 --> 04:39.152
called, "Let's See
Your Moves, Tarzana."

04:39.229 --> 04:41.213
People will buy tickets
to watch local celebrities

04:41.248 --> 04:44.540
like the mayor
and Channel 8 weatherman dance.

04:44.576 --> 04:47.786
- Oh.
- And we want you to be the headlining star

04:47.821 --> 04:49.538
of the big final dance!

04:49.540 --> 04:53.708
- Oh!
- You can pick your partner and dance style:

04:53.743 --> 04:56.153
Tango, waltz, samba...

04:56.188 --> 04:57.871
Oh, sure, I know
how to do all those.

04:57.906 --> 04:59.589
Terrific! I really
want this to go well.

04:59.625 --> 05:02.918
It has to go well or I'll be
kicked out of school forever.

05:02.953 --> 05:04.794
Oh, no, really?

05:04.829 --> 05:06.921
No! Founder of the Drama Club.
And scene.

05:10.777 --> 05:11.777
Bernie!

05:14.239 --> 05:16.706
I just got myself
into big trouble.

05:16.741 --> 05:18.650
I said I'd be
in this fundraiser,

05:18.685 --> 05:20.510
but I don't know
how to ballroom dance.

05:20.546 --> 05:24.631
I'm gonna look ridiculous
in front of the entire school.

05:24.666 --> 05:27.768
I only said yes because,
Rachel's so nice and cool,

05:27.803 --> 05:30.470
and I wanna be friends with her!

05:30.505 --> 05:32.366
Well, if you want,
I could be your dance partner.

05:32.390 --> 05:33.648
I'm a great ballroom dancer.

05:33.683 --> 05:35.650
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:35.686 --> 05:37.961
I've been taking lessons
since I was four.

05:37.996 --> 05:40.930
Trust me, I can teach you
how to dance.

05:40.966 --> 05:42.749
Grandma, I need you
to teach me how to dance!

05:45.453 --> 05:48.821
Let me guess, this is all to
impress your fake ex-girlfriend?

05:48.857 --> 05:51.925
I think the question is, which
fake ex-girlfriend, am I right?

05:53.954 --> 05:55.428
Why would I high-five that?

05:57.432 --> 05:59.341
Let's just start
with the basics.

05:59.376 --> 06:00.653
When you're first
learning to dance,

06:00.677 --> 06:02.618
it helps to count out the steps.

06:02.654 --> 06:06.406
One two three four,
one two three four.

06:06.441 --> 06:08.983
One two three four!
One two three four!

06:10.737 --> 06:13.805
Grandma, I ran out of hands.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.284
All right,
I don't have time for this,

06:15.308 --> 06:17.917
I got my fight club at 8:00.

06:17.953 --> 06:20.586
Okay, first...

06:20.622 --> 06:21.916
hold me tight like you hold your teddy
bear when there's a thunderstorm.

06:21.940 --> 06:23.859
- I don't hold my teddy bear...
- (making thunder noises)

06:23.883 --> 06:26.000
(screams)

06:26.036 --> 06:27.785
Now, puff out your chest.

06:27.820 --> 06:29.621
More.

06:29.656 --> 06:32.190
More.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.261
Like you did when you felt threatened
by that squirrel at the park.

06:34.285 --> 06:35.385
Stupid squirrel.

06:37.831 --> 06:40.314
Now tiptoe, like it's
the middle of the night,

06:40.350 --> 06:43.030
and you're trying to sneak into the
living room to watch a PG movie.

06:47.023 --> 06:48.948
Grandma! I'm dancing!

06:48.984 --> 06:50.742
I'm dancing!

06:50.777 --> 06:53.302
Maybe I am ready for a PG movie!

06:53.338 --> 06:54.571
I don't think so.

06:59.319 --> 07:01.777
Okay. Remember,
we go through all five steps

07:01.813 --> 07:03.257
until we agree on
how to decorate our studio.

07:03.281 --> 07:07.801

- I still think I'm right.

07:38.984 --> 07:43.694
(Yeti speaks)

07:43.730 --> 07:46.748
I just think our fans have a
lot of really great ideas.

07:50.362 --> 07:52.871
Well, I'm a dragon!
And I'm bigger than you!

07:52.906 --> 07:56.775
Yawr! Yawr! Yawr! Yum! Yum, yum.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.094
Got a new puppet, huh?

07:59.129 --> 08:03.606
(Yeti speaks)

08:03.641 --> 08:08.728
(death metal playing)

08:19.316 --> 08:24.410
(Yeti speaks)

08:29.759 --> 08:31.851
Hey, Frankie, do you...

08:31.887 --> 08:33.962
Oh. Sorry. Didn't realize
you guys were arguing.

08:36.541 --> 08:40.534
(Yeti speaks)

08:40.570 --> 08:43.713
(inhaling)

08:43.748 --> 08:46.482
I just think the Internet is a
playground of ideas and opinions,

08:46.517 --> 08:50.136
and we have a responsibility as part of
that community to embrace those thoughts,

08:50.172 --> 08:52.012
or risk the collapse
of the entire institution.

08:54.951 --> 08:56.943
(inhaling)

08:56.978 --> 08:58.069
You're wrong!

09:00.240 --> 09:01.915
Frankie, that was the last step.

09:01.950 --> 09:03.374
We still haven't
solved anything.

09:03.409 --> 09:04.784
Hey, well, don't get mad at me.

09:04.819 --> 09:05.769
We wouldn't even
be having this disagreement

09:05.804 --> 09:09.046
if you didn't care so much
about what other people think.

09:09.082 --> 09:10.022
No, I don't.

09:10.058 --> 09:11.640
Really?

09:11.676 --> 09:13.292
Why do you wear
that shirt so much?

09:13.328 --> 09:14.596
I get a lot of compliments
on it.

09:14.620 --> 09:16.663
Yeah, exactly.
Everybody hates this shirt.

09:16.698 --> 09:18.314
But I wear it, 'cause I like it.

09:18.349 --> 09:22.193
I... I guess I value other people's
opinions 'cause I'm a nice person.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.322
Oh, so I'm not a nice person.

09:23.346 --> 09:25.739
No. I'm not saying that.

09:25.774 --> 09:26.774
Except you just did.

09:28.042 --> 09:30.000
Okay.

09:30.036 --> 09:31.036
Tension.

09:33.506 --> 09:34.898
Look. If I'm being honest,

09:34.933 --> 09:38.351
sometimes it seems like you
only care about what you think.

09:38.387 --> 09:39.805
Yeah... Well, maybe 'cause I
have confidence in myself

09:39.829 --> 09:41.862
and I know who I am.

09:41.898 --> 09:43.256
Wait... So I don't know who I am?

09:43.291 --> 09:45.307
I'm not saying that.

09:45.343 --> 09:46.343
Except you just did.

09:48.554 --> 09:49.874
Okay, I can feel
the tension, too.

09:51.149 --> 09:53.140
Are we in a fight?

09:53.176 --> 09:54.936
I don't know. We've never
been in one before.

09:56.529 --> 09:58.722
I think we are.

09:58.757 --> 10:03.251
<i>Congratulations!

- And we're a thing.

10:18.918 --> 10:20.854
We're gonna be doing the Cookie
on Your Face challenge.

10:20.878 --> 10:22.811
So each of us is gonna
put one of these cookies

10:22.847 --> 10:24.533
on our face, try to maneuver it
down our face,

10:24.557 --> 10:25.565
and then into our mouths,

10:25.600 --> 10:26.916
but we can't use our hands.

10:26.951 --> 10:28.159
Let's get our cookie on!

10:58.183 --> 10:59.183
- Ahh...
- No!

11:01.669 --> 11:03.236
Grandma didn't raise a loser!

11:03.271 --> 11:05.254
Yeah!

11:05.290 --> 11:06.617
Can you do it
with your eyes closed?

11:06.641 --> 11:08.066
Yeah.

11:08.101 --> 11:09.959
What type of cookie is this?

11:09.994 --> 11:12.428
Uh, well it has jelly on it.

11:12.464 --> 11:13.988
That might be a little slimy.

11:14.023 --> 11:15.915
Aagh!

11:15.950 --> 11:18.217
Ugh!

11:18.252 --> 11:20.361
It's in my hair! It's in my...

11:20.396 --> 11:21.545
Both: We're both winners!

11:21.581 --> 11:22.821
Except for the fact that I won.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.387
Oh.

11:29.422 --> 11:30.680
Hey.

11:30.715 --> 11:31.723
Hey.

11:33.559 --> 11:35.034
Got anything
you wanna say to me?

11:35.070 --> 11:36.769
- (locker door closing)
- No.

11:38.773 --> 11:40.014
Anything you wanna say to me?

11:40.049 --> 11:41.958
Nope.

11:41.993 --> 11:45.186
Hey, guys. I just wanna let you know
I'm starting a Friendship Club,

11:45.221 --> 11:47.781
- and I think you two would be fanta...
- Paige/Frankie: Not now!

11:49.818 --> 11:52.527
(sigh)
Frankie, what are we doing?

11:52.562 --> 11:54.311
We can't stay
in this fight forever.

11:54.347 --> 11:56.439
Yeah, you're right.

11:56.474 --> 11:57.668
An apology would just
end this whole thing.

11:57.692 --> 11:59.508
Great.

11:59.544 --> 12:01.152
So go ahead.

12:01.187 --> 12:02.903
- I'm sorry?
- Thank you.

12:02.938 --> 12:04.246
No, no, that was a question.

12:04.281 --> 12:07.449
You see the person who should
apologize is the one who's wrong,

12:07.485 --> 12:09.560
so... you go ahead.

12:09.596 --> 12:11.763
Ohhh. Okay.

12:13.449 --> 12:14.924
- I'm sorry...
- Thank you.

12:14.959 --> 12:18.077
Hang on. Not done.

12:18.112 --> 12:20.272
I'm sorry that you're selfishly
avoiding responsibility

12:20.298 --> 12:21.298
for this fight.

12:22.642 --> 12:24.833
You know what?

12:24.869 --> 12:26.138
I feel an apology
coming on as well.

12:26.162 --> 12:29.021
- Oh.
- I am so sorry

12:29.057 --> 12:31.683
that you're so sensitive
to what other people think,

12:31.718 --> 12:33.918
because I think that this
fight is all your fault,

12:33.953 --> 12:37.438
and, your face is dumb!

12:37.473 --> 12:40.883
Oh. This face? This face?

12:40.919 --> 12:42.993
You know what?

12:43.029 --> 12:45.046
- I'm giving you the silent treatment.
- Whatever.

12:45.081 --> 12:46.848
Ey!

12:46.850 --> 12:48.850
Don't walk away from me
when I'm not talkin' to you!

12:48.852 --> 12:51.511
I've still got a lot of things
not to say to you!

12:56.776 --> 13:00.936
(with accent): Amelia! It is I,
Bernardo, your dance instructor.

13:00.971 --> 13:02.651
Take my hand
and we will glide like angels.

13:04.918 --> 13:06.517
Ew, it's all sweaty.

13:06.552 --> 13:08.686
My doctor says it's normal.

13:08.721 --> 13:10.454
Now let's dance.

13:10.489 --> 13:12.824
(piano waltz playing)

13:16.412 --> 13:17.954
Hold on. One second.

13:17.989 --> 13:20.957
You know what? Let's just
concentrate on our feet.

13:23.870 --> 13:26.679
Ow!

13:26.714 --> 13:28.664
I don't know much about dancing,

13:28.700 --> 13:30.383
but I do know that you're
supposed to lead.

13:30.418 --> 13:32.393
I am leading.

13:32.429 --> 13:33.429
Now dip me!

13:35.632 --> 13:37.723
Dip you?
You're supposed to dip me.

13:40.128 --> 13:43.062
Oh, no, I think Grandma
only taught me the girl parts!

13:44.833 --> 13:47.258
Grandma?

13:47.293 --> 13:49.685
Did you lie to me
about knowin' how to dance?

13:49.720 --> 13:53.181
Okay. Yeah, I did, but...

13:53.216 --> 13:55.891
You were upset, and I wanted
to help make it better.

13:55.927 --> 13:58.052
And you know, if...

13:58.087 --> 13:59.011
you were impressed and wanted
to get married after that,

13:59.046 --> 14:00.947
so be it.

14:00.982 --> 14:03.082
You didn't help!

14:03.117 --> 14:05.551
I told Rachel I'd do it,
and I can't back out now.

14:05.586 --> 14:07.061
I'm gonna be embarrassed

14:07.097 --> 14:08.349
in front of the entire
school tomorrow,

14:08.373 --> 14:09.373
because of you!

14:11.250 --> 14:12.890
- But the marriage thing, is that...
- No!

14:16.406 --> 14:19.523
Oh. You're here.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.801
Yeah, um, last time I checked,
this is my studio, too.

14:21.836 --> 14:22.726
Well, if it's all right with you

14:22.762 --> 14:23.864
and your stupid dinosaur poster,

14:23.888 --> 14:25.405
I'm gonna get some work done.

14:25.440 --> 14:26.759
Well, uh, don't expect me
to talk to you.

14:26.783 --> 14:28.024
Don't expect me to talk to you.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.361
(typing on keyboard)

14:55.545 --> 14:57.553
(typing louder)

15:20.720 --> 15:21.786
(smash)

15:24.432 --> 15:26.376
- That's it!
- Oh, uh, I'm sorry, did that upset you?

15:26.400 --> 15:27.992
What do you think?

15:28.027 --> 15:29.594
Look who suddenly cares

15:29.629 --> 15:30.378
about what other people think!

15:30.413 --> 15:32.688
Oooh! Good burn!

15:32.724 --> 15:34.915
But don't take my word for it.

15:34.951 --> 15:36.520
Why don't you go online
and see if other people like it

15:36.544 --> 15:38.336
so you can go,

15:38.371 --> 15:41.230
"Mmm, compliments!
That tastes good!"

15:41.265 --> 15:44.700
You know what? Maybe I
will put something online.

15:44.736 --> 15:46.794
Hey, everybody, what do I do?

15:46.829 --> 15:49.539
In a fight with my
so-called best friend!

15:49.574 --> 15:51.582
So-called best friend?

15:51.618 --> 15:52.491
What about former best friend?

15:52.527 --> 15:53.734
Even better!

16:04.906 --> 16:07.423
- (knocking on door)
- Frankie.

16:07.458 --> 16:09.458
- Are you okay?
- No.

16:11.712 --> 16:12.731
Do you wanna talk about it?

16:12.755 --> 16:15.056
No.

16:15.091 --> 16:17.642
Do you wanna see
a really disgusting x-ray

16:17.677 --> 16:19.376
of a guy who swallowed a lizard?

16:19.411 --> 16:20.803
Yeah.

16:24.275 --> 16:26.183
Ohhh! Gross!

16:27.403 --> 16:28.403
Thanks, Dad.

16:30.873 --> 16:32.814
Is this about your fight
with Paige?

16:32.850 --> 16:35.751
Yeah. She's the worst.

16:35.787 --> 16:36.838
She cares too much
about what other people think,

16:36.862 --> 16:38.445
and it drives me crazy.

16:38.481 --> 16:40.239
Well, that must be tough.

16:42.460 --> 16:43.762
So, are you gonna tell her
why you feel that way?

16:43.786 --> 16:46.086
No.

16:46.122 --> 16:48.940
All right. I guess we'll have
to find you a new best friend.

16:48.975 --> 16:50.561
- What?
- Let's check out your old yearbook.

16:50.585 --> 16:51.834
Hm.

16:53.562 --> 16:54.462
Here we go: Megan Murphy.

16:54.497 --> 16:56.305
Dad.

16:56.341 --> 16:58.482
Her quote is,

16:58.518 --> 17:00.843
"Our beaches are eroding,
just like our souls."

17:00.878 --> 17:02.261
She sounds fun.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.430
I don't want a new best friend.

17:07.485 --> 17:08.645
Then you need to talk to her.

17:10.288 --> 17:15.065
Frankie, if you don't wanna
lose Paige as your best friend,

17:15.100 --> 17:16.670
she needs to know
where you're coming from.

17:16.694 --> 17:19.945
But... it's too hard.

17:21.399 --> 17:23.116
Why?

17:23.151 --> 17:24.151
It's personal.

17:25.503 --> 17:26.503
You know.

17:30.700 --> 17:32.583
Maybe it's time
Paige knows, too.

17:34.996 --> 17:38.239
Ohh, Frankie, I love you.

17:38.274 --> 17:39.965
I promise, everything's
gonna be okay.

17:41.761 --> 17:43.177
Thanks, Dad.

17:47.708 --> 17:50.576
(knocking on door)

17:50.611 --> 17:53.562
It's Saturday, Grandma. We agreed
I could stay up until seven.

17:56.634 --> 18:00.169
Amelia? Is this a dream?

18:00.205 --> 18:01.965
Are we solving unicorn
crimes like last time?

18:03.149 --> 18:05.683
No.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.668
Wait.
What's my crime solvin' name?

18:07.703 --> 18:09.929
Officer Glittersparkle.

18:09.964 --> 18:12.673
Make me a lieutenant, and I want a
full report on my desk tomorrow.

18:12.709 --> 18:13.709
Yes, ma'am!

18:16.779 --> 18:17.920
Bernie!

18:20.099 --> 18:21.465
That's not what I came here for.

18:23.995 --> 18:27.254
I'm sorry
I yelled at you yesterday.

18:27.289 --> 18:30.950
You saw I was upset and your
first instinct was to help me.

18:30.985 --> 18:33.168
Thank you.

18:33.203 --> 18:36.497
Of course.
That's what friends do.

18:36.532 --> 18:39.608
I say, who cares if we don't
know how to fancy dance.

18:39.643 --> 18:43.837
If we go to that fundraiser,
have fun and be ourselves,

18:43.873 --> 18:46.332
I'm sure the audience
will love us.

18:46.367 --> 18:48.242
- Wait... Are you saying...
- Yes.

18:50.855 --> 18:53.247
Bernie Schotz...
will you be my dance partner?

18:59.697 --> 19:01.839
Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!

19:04.652 --> 19:08.220
<i>♪</i>

19:10.691 --> 19:14.176
(applause)

19:14.211 --> 19:16.645
Well, let's hear it
for the mayor.

19:16.680 --> 19:19.081
She can cut a rug,
and funding for the arts.

19:19.116 --> 19:23.493
(applause)

19:23.529 --> 19:26.747
And now, the for the performance
we've all been waiting for,

19:26.783 --> 19:30.767
let's give it up for Vuuugle
star Amelia Duckworth and...

19:30.803 --> 19:32.620
partner!

19:32.655 --> 19:34.246
Bernie: Aagh.

19:36.467 --> 19:40.211
(applause)

19:42.506 --> 19:45.132
Remember, just have fun.

19:46.702 --> 19:52.181
(pop dance music playing)

20:32.690 --> 20:35.983
Oh! They love us! They love us!

20:36.018 --> 20:38.577
They hated us! They hated us!

20:38.612 --> 20:40.379
What were we thinkin'?

20:40.414 --> 20:42.314
They wanted somethin'
formal, like a waltz,

20:42.350 --> 20:44.533
and we just went out there

20:44.610 --> 20:46.213
and followed our hearts
and did what we believed in.

20:46.237 --> 20:47.569
Who does that?

20:49.515 --> 20:50.773
Amelia, it's gonna be okay.

20:50.808 --> 20:53.534
People booed us!

20:53.569 --> 20:55.449
The mayor just yelled the
word "disappointment"!

20:57.256 --> 20:58.972
Rachel probably thinks
I'm a loser now.

20:59.008 --> 21:02.009
Hey! We had fun out there,

21:02.011 --> 21:03.605
and that's something
that we should be proud of.

21:03.629 --> 21:05.654
Wow!

21:05.690 --> 21:07.247
You two dancing...

21:07.283 --> 21:09.858
was the most horrifying
thing I've ever seen.

21:09.894 --> 21:11.135
And I was a medic in the war.

21:16.175 --> 21:18.442
Hey, can I...?

21:18.477 --> 21:20.202
What are you doin' to my Yeti?

21:20.238 --> 21:22.838
(sigh) I'm mourning the
conflict-free friendship

21:22.873 --> 21:24.798
that used to be
Paige and Frankie.

21:24.833 --> 21:27.125
And I'm about to set
this Yeti ablaze

21:27.161 --> 21:29.219
as a symbol of our inability

21:29.255 --> 21:32.172
to end this fight.

21:32.208 --> 21:33.974
Aw, you put
so much effort into this.

21:34.009 --> 21:35.329
I just buried my face
in a hoodie.

21:37.989 --> 21:39.613
Hey, can we talk for a second?

21:39.648 --> 21:40.706
Yeah.

21:43.344 --> 21:45.310
I'm gonna do something
I... I rarely do.

21:45.346 --> 21:48.380
Open up and express feelings
in words.

21:48.415 --> 21:50.624
Okay.

21:50.660 --> 21:52.710
You say I don't care
what other people think.

21:52.745 --> 21:57.181
And yeah, that's sometimes true.

21:57.216 --> 22:00.467
But that's because it's not easy
for me to depend on people.

22:00.502 --> 22:01.985
What do you mean?

22:02.020 --> 22:03.479
I depended on my mom.

22:05.291 --> 22:07.023
And then she left.

22:07.059 --> 22:09.693
And it... it really hurt.

22:12.715 --> 22:17.618
So I guess sometimes
I... put up a wall because

22:17.653 --> 22:20.414
I'm afraid if I open up and... and
let people in, I'll get hurt again.

22:23.392 --> 22:25.167
I'm sure you just love
all this gooey stuff.

22:32.001 --> 22:32.624
I'm insecure.

22:32.659 --> 22:35.502
What?

22:35.538 --> 22:38.564
That's why I care so much
about what other people think.

22:38.599 --> 22:41.608
Then I hate that I do because...

22:41.643 --> 22:43.052
what you think should be enough,

22:43.087 --> 22:46.922
but... for some reason, I...

22:46.957 --> 22:48.524
I still want
everyone else's approval.

22:50.819 --> 22:53.671
I wish I were as secure as you,

22:53.706 --> 22:54.988
but I'm not.

23:01.079 --> 23:02.979
Am I doin' this right?

23:03.015 --> 23:05.515
You're doin' great.

23:05.551 --> 23:07.418
I don't wanna fight anymore,
I'm sorry.

23:07.453 --> 23:08.453
I'm sorry, too.

23:11.391 --> 23:13.311
Ah! This feels so good!
Can we do this every day?

23:14.643 --> 23:16.143
N... No way.

23:16.178 --> 23:18.787
Feeling feelings is exhausting.

23:18.822 --> 23:20.425
But we still do need
to decorate our studio.

23:20.449 --> 23:22.782
Why don't we see
what our fans think?

23:22.818 --> 23:25.143
- Really?
- Yeah, we have the best fans.

23:25.179 --> 23:25.894
Let's see
what they came up with.

23:25.929 --> 23:27.187
Ahh.

23:28.808 --> 23:30.107
"White walls?"

23:30.142 --> 23:32.559
"Cool stuff?"

23:32.594 --> 23:34.111
"You guys figure it out."

23:36.415 --> 23:37.965
Maybe we just
decorate it ourselves.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.074
I love you.

23:39.109 --> 23:40.451
Love you more.

23:44.740 --> 23:46.473
What's up, guys?

23:46.509 --> 23:47.599
- I'm Paige.
- I'm Frankie.

23:47.635 --> 23:48.753
Both: And we're Bizaardvark.

23:48.777 --> 23:50.110
Welcome to our new studio.

23:50.146 --> 23:50.769
Who wants a tour?

23:50.804 --> 23:51.912
(cheering)

23:51.947 --> 23:53.488
Lookit!

23:53.523 --> 23:54.431
Says, Both: It says Bizaardvark!

23:54.466 --> 23:56.075
Aah! It still says Bizaardvark!

23:56.110 --> 23:57.754
I think the first thing
that we should show off

23:57.778 --> 23:59.923
'cause we're the most proud
of this... um, is our toilet.

23:59.947 --> 24:01.772
It can talk. Hello.

24:01.849 --> 24:04.425
- It doesn't function as a toilet.
- It doesn't?

24:04.460 --> 24:07.377
Paige... don't tell me y...

24:07.413 --> 24:09.354
(toilet flushing)

24:09.389 --> 24:10.483
Paige: That's us eating pizza.
We love pizza a lot.

24:10.507 --> 24:13.367
- This is our sound booth.
- I'm in the sound booth right now.

24:13.402 --> 24:17.404
- Yeah, um, sh...
- It's our sound booth.

24:17.439 --> 24:19.651
I can hear her, butThis is a booth
a thing from my mom's restaurant.

24:19.675 --> 24:21.327
Don't tell her I stole it.
She doesn't know.

24:21.351 --> 24:22.243
Both: These are chairs!

24:22.278 --> 24:23.460
Chairs again!

24:23.495 --> 24:25.137
Two people, one chair!

24:25.172 --> 24:25.946
Too big for a chair!

24:25.981 --> 24:27.689
Little too tall.

24:27.724 --> 24:29.052
- Both: Bizaardvark!
- Bizaardvark!

24:29.076 --> 24:30.008
Both: Bizaardvark! Bizaardvark!

24:30.044 --> 24:33.094
Bizaardvark!
