00:00.778 --> 00:02.220
<i>So here's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

00:02.253 --> 00:04.183
<i>Sue framed Figgins</i>
<i>so she could take his job</i>

00:04.216 --> 00:05.910
<i>so now she's principal</i>
<i>and Becky's her Beckretary.</i>

00:05.943 --> 00:07.906
- BECKY: Get out, bitch!
- <i>Kurt started a cover band</i>

00:07.939 --> 00:09.426
<i>called Pamela Lansbury</i>
<i>and Rachel's in it</i>

00:09.459 --> 00:12.031
<i>and so is Santana and so is</i>
<i>Dani and so is Elliot,</i>

00:12.064 --> 00:14.241
<i>who they also call Star Child</i>
<i>but his name's really Elliot.</i>

00:14.274 --> 00:15.677
KURT: Oh, my God, Star Child.

00:15.710 --> 00:17.829
<i>Jake used to be a man-slut</i>
<i>but then he wasn't</i>

00:17.862 --> 00:20.411
<i>because he met Marley but then</i>
<i>he cheated on Marley with Bree</i>

00:20.452 --> 00:21.878
<i>which was so super mean</i>
<i>because Marley's so nice</i>

00:21.905 --> 00:23.151
<i>and Bree's so horrible</i>
<i>and it's like, geez,</i>

00:23.169 --> 00:25.046
<i>I guess he's a man-slut again.</i>
<i>That's so sad.</i>

00:25.079 --> 00:27.637
UNIQUE: My Aunt Felicia always says,
"A tiger can't change his stripes."

00:27.670 --> 00:29.181
<i>And that's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

00:30.602 --> 00:33.525
(all clamoring)

00:35.834 --> 00:37.308
Hey, um, guys!

00:37.341 --> 00:38.802
Guys... New Directions!

00:38.835 --> 00:39.876
New Directions!

00:39.909 --> 00:41.725
Guys! Hey!

00:41.759 --> 00:43.405
I just ran into Mr. Shue,
and he's gonna be stuck

00:43.438 --> 00:45.179
in his classroom for the
rest of the afternoon

00:45.212 --> 00:47.094
because of some school board
inspection thing,

00:47.127 --> 00:49.364
but he still wanted us to meet so we can
start working on ideas for nationals.

00:49.405 --> 00:52.279
Beyoncé!
(all yelling over each other)

00:56.280 --> 00:59.282
This is anarchy! We can't... we can't
all just shout at the same time.

01:01.564 --> 01:03.604
That's better.

01:03.637 --> 01:04.879
I have some ideas already.
I'm thinking

01:04.913 --> 01:06.648
that the music needs
to be really simple,

01:06.681 --> 01:07.882
so we can really highlight
our voices.

01:07.917 --> 01:10.093
No guitars, or
nothing electronic.

01:10.126 --> 01:11.497
We go with
a simple piano arrangement.

01:11.538 --> 01:13.311
Which I could play.

01:13.344 --> 01:14.879
I'm assuming
you're singing lead?

01:14.912 --> 01:17.884
Well, I am a senior,
and this is my last go at it.

01:17.917 --> 01:19.425
We need to win this.

01:19.458 --> 01:20.660
Well, feels like North Korea
up in here.

01:20.693 --> 01:22.400
Okay, forget the piano.

01:22.433 --> 01:23.536
Forget all the music.

01:23.569 --> 01:26.378
We could just do, um, a
cappella, that always works.

01:26.419 --> 01:28.397
Déjà Warblers. Should we wear
matching blazers, too?

01:28.430 --> 01:30.239
Let's take it back...
What was wrong with the guitars?

01:30.272 --> 01:33.287
Nothing, why can't you guys
just stop resisting me

01:33.320 --> 01:34.891
for a second,
and just go with me?

01:34.924 --> 01:36.460
Okay, Blaine Jong-il.

01:36.493 --> 01:38.768
- Yes! Blaine Jong-il
- I am not trying to be bossy.

01:38.801 --> 01:41.210
I am trying to give
the benefit of my experience.

01:41.243 --> 01:44.328
I have won more show choir
competitions than anyone in this room.

01:45.964 --> 01:46.933
(coughs): You suck.

01:48.876 --> 01:50.956
A capella is worth a shot.

01:50.989 --> 01:52.697
Let's do it.

01:52.730 --> 01:55.810
- Thank you. - UNIQUE: Then you two can have
fun in your little barbershop couplet

01:55.838 --> 01:57.747
while the rest of us
discuss something good.

01:57.780 --> 02:00.687
Fine. You don't want my help...

02:03.691 --> 02:06.658
...then I am not gonna give it.

02:06.691 --> 02:08.531
Looks like somebody's
man-struating.

02:08.564 --> 02:10.565
I heard that.

02:11.494 --> 02:14.463

02:14.583 --> 02:16.183
Oh, good.

02:16.216 --> 02:17.519
We're all here.

02:17.552 --> 02:21.361
Thank you, Team Pamela Lansbury, for
assembling on such short notice.

02:21.402 --> 02:23.200
Okay, well, I rescheduled
my dialect session,

02:23.233 --> 02:25.569
so what's up with
this emergency text?

02:25.602 --> 02:29.444
What's up is I just booked
our band's debut gig!

02:29.478 --> 02:30.741
(gasps) Amazing.

02:30.782 --> 02:31.477
Where? When?

02:31.510 --> 02:36.666
This Thursday, 7:30 p.m., at the
Greenwich Village hot-spot Callbacks.

02:36.699 --> 02:40.402
Ooh, NYADA's premier piano bar. Hold
on, isn't that a Broadway hangout?

02:40.435 --> 02:41.972
Well, traditionally, but
I talked to the manager,

02:42.005 --> 02:44.006
and he says that Thursdays are
kind of their dead nights.

02:44.039 --> 02:45.478
So we can go in
and do whatever we want.

02:45.511 --> 02:46.911
No way, we cannot debut there.

02:46.944 --> 02:48.882
That is instant career suicide.

02:48.915 --> 02:50.988
Yeah, Kurt, look,
not to overstep,

02:51.021 --> 02:53.060
but I-I follow a lot of bands
just starting out,

02:53.093 --> 02:55.328
and it's kind of all
about the launch.

02:55.361 --> 02:57.033
You know, getting music critics
out to see you,

02:57.066 --> 02:59.508
and that's a lot easier
with the right venue.

02:59.541 --> 03:02.110
Oh, come on, Callbacks is
a real funky place.

03:02.143 --> 03:04.479
You know, they've got tons of history.
Yeah, but I can't think

03:04.512 --> 03:06.352
of a single band
that started out there.

03:06.385 --> 03:09.389
I mean, it's not like The Bitter
End or the Mercury Lounge, or...

03:09.422 --> 03:10.757
Yeah, and if people
associate that place

03:10.790 --> 03:13.662
with show tunes, nobody's
gonna come out for...

03:13.695 --> 03:15.632
Our covers
of Madonna's greatest hits?

03:15.665 --> 03:17.031
I disagree, Dani.

03:17.064 --> 03:19.671
Oh, so we're back
to the whole Madonna thing?

03:19.704 --> 03:21.104
Yes, it was my first impulse.

03:21.138 --> 03:24.344
Okay, look, guys, I know it's
untraditional, but you have to trust me.

03:24.377 --> 03:25.880
I was there at Callbacks.

03:25.913 --> 03:29.284
I saw it all, a vision
of perfect clarity.

03:29.317 --> 03:31.389
Every seat was occupied.

03:31.422 --> 03:33.620
A quiet hush fell
over the expectant crowd.

03:33.653 --> 03:36.356
As Pamela Lansbury made
their way to the stage,

03:36.389 --> 03:41.935
and the opening notes of Madonna's 1985
single hit "Into the Groove" begin.

03:41.968 --> 03:44.368

the Groove" begins)

06:07.622 --> 06:09.492
Oh, it's my fiancé.

06:09.525 --> 06:10.260
Talk amongst yourselves.

06:10.293 --> 06:11.659
Hello?

06:11.692 --> 06:14.091
Oh, can I just say
Glee Club sucks!

06:14.132 --> 06:15.427
Mr. Shue asked
for ideas for nationals.

06:15.460 --> 06:20.296
And when I gave some genius ones, everyone
got all mad and started dissing me.

06:20.329 --> 06:21.737
Maybe I came on too strong.

06:21.770 --> 06:23.370
But since when is
that a bad thing?

06:23.403 --> 06:26.167
It's not, but you got to remember, at
McKinley everyone has an equal vote.

06:26.200 --> 06:28.806
And if you come on too aggressively,
they might think you're a control-freak

06:28.839 --> 06:30.838
or a puppet master.

06:32.438 --> 06:35.139
Anyway... I was gonna call you.

06:35.172 --> 06:36.938
Pamela Lansbury booked
its first gig.

06:36.979 --> 06:38.713
And I know you were just here,

06:38.746 --> 06:41.175
but I was hoping you could come
cheer us on in the audience.

06:41.208 --> 06:42.943
So, what do you say...
can I send you the deets?

06:42.976 --> 06:44.384
And a JetBlue voucher?

06:44.417 --> 06:45.953
Uh, of course,
I wouldn't miss it.

06:45.986 --> 06:48.645
Wow, I can't believe anyone
would see me as controlling.

06:48.686 --> 06:49.653
You missed a spot.

06:49.686 --> 06:52.589
I'm doing the best I can, Sue.

06:52.622 --> 06:55.018
You know, the way
you clean these floors

06:55.051 --> 06:57.553
is a perfect metaphor for
the way you ran this school.

06:57.586 --> 07:00.225
You did your best, but your
best just wasn't good enough.

07:00.258 --> 07:01.825
Look, I know you're upset

07:01.858 --> 07:04.056
that the school board is coming
today to evaluate McKinley,

07:04.097 --> 07:07.628
and to determine if I'm worthy to
be instated as full-time principal.

07:07.661 --> 07:10.294
And do you realize in my short
time as acting principal,

07:10.334 --> 07:12.430
test scores have risen 42%.

07:12.470 --> 07:17.805
And my new caning policy has dropped both
absences and tardiness down to zero.

07:17.838 --> 07:23.141
So, the truth is you should be cleaning
floors and I should be running schools.

07:23.174 --> 07:25.613
And if you would like
to continue cleaning floors

07:25.646 --> 07:28.282
and feeding your family,
I suggest you do

07:28.315 --> 07:31.683
everything you can to make sure
this place looks just amazing

07:31.716 --> 07:33.388
for this evaluation.

07:33.421 --> 07:35.156
They're in your office, Coach.

07:41.230 --> 07:42.968
One last question
before we come back

07:43.001 --> 07:44.971
for the official evaluation
later in the week.

07:45.004 --> 07:46.842
Why do you want
to be a principal?

07:46.875 --> 07:50.041
Now, I know everyone wants to wear
the crown, but the fantasy of it

07:50.074 --> 07:51.871
can be quite different
from the reality.

07:51.904 --> 07:56.577
Well, more than anyone I have ever
met, I was born to be in charge.

07:56.618 --> 07:57.583
Test scores are up.

07:57.617 --> 07:58.847
Kids are showing up.

07:58.880 --> 08:00.216
Our sports teams are winning.

08:00.249 --> 08:01.817
Heck, even the Glee Club
is back competing

08:01.850 --> 08:04.256
for the national title of clubs
no one really cares about.

08:04.289 --> 08:08.156
And all of this is happening because
I can finally manifest my vision

08:08.189 --> 08:10.859
without having to clear it
with some fool.

08:10.893 --> 08:13.323
You give me this school,
and in one year

08:13.356 --> 08:15.223
it will be the top school
in the state.

08:15.256 --> 08:16.256
I guarantee it.

08:16.289 --> 08:18.161
I'm a champion, gentlemen.

08:18.194 --> 08:20.562
Let me be your champion.

08:23.098 --> 08:25.032
We'll be back in a week.

08:25.065 --> 08:28.869
But between you and me, barring a
total catastrophe, you have my vote.

08:31.269 --> 08:35.139
You certainly have a lot of
trophies, Principal Sylvester.

08:35.172 --> 08:39.011
Well, Superintendent Harris, you're
new in town, you may not be aware,

08:39.044 --> 08:41.519
but I am the only seven-time
national champion cheerleading coach

08:41.552 --> 08:42.520
in the country.

08:42.553 --> 08:44.952
Hmm, my wife used to watch those
competitions on television.

08:44.985 --> 08:47.590
Mm-hmm. Bugged the crap out of me
if I'm gonna be totally honest.

08:47.623 --> 08:48.989
Mmm.
(chuckles)

08:49.022 --> 08:50.759
- We're divorced.
- Oh.

08:50.792 --> 08:51.696
Are you married?

08:51.729 --> 08:52.760
No, no.

08:52.793 --> 08:54.913
I married myself once, but I
don't think it was legal.

08:54.927 --> 08:55.693
(laughs)

08:55.726 --> 08:56.931
Yeah.

08:56.964 --> 08:58.592
We should go out
for a beer sometime.

08:58.625 --> 09:02.865
Oh, are you sure that's
appropriate, Bob?

09:02.898 --> 09:05.200
I don't think anyone would see
a couple of guys going out

09:05.233 --> 09:06.536
for a beer as anything shady.

09:06.569 --> 09:08.071
Besides I'm new in town.

09:08.103 --> 09:09.767
I'd like to find some
great dudes to hang out with.

09:09.807 --> 09:11.903
I-I'll call your office, okay?

09:11.936 --> 09:13.637
(grunts) (chuckles)

09:16.739 --> 09:21.717
I'm lactose intolerant, and
I may have to fart, Coach.

09:21.750 --> 09:24.081
I don't look masculine,
do I, Becky?

09:24.114 --> 09:27.417
You have an allure
that goes beyond gender.

09:27.450 --> 09:28.450
That's what I always say.

09:28.451 --> 09:32.890
I have to admit, while I find his hairline
highly suspicious for a man his age,

09:32.923 --> 09:37.327
that Bob Harris thinks I could star
in the sequel to <i>Boys Don't Cry,</i>

09:37.360 --> 09:39.694
honestly, it kind
of bums me out.

09:39.727 --> 09:40.822
Maybe it's your clothes.

09:40.863 --> 09:43.359
You could try on a skirt
every now and then.

09:43.400 --> 09:45.463
No, you don't understand
the era I grew up in.

09:45.496 --> 09:47.303
I became a teacher
almost 30 years ago.

09:47.336 --> 09:49.798
It was 1986.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.103
It was a different time.

09:51.136 --> 09:53.904
<i>I tried being girly.</i>

09:53.945 --> 09:56.640
<i>But I found it hard to get</i>
<i>the respect I felt I deserved.</i>

09:56.680 --> 09:59.277
Boys, no video games in school.

09:59.310 --> 10:00.949
Who are you supposed to be?

10:00.982 --> 10:02.518
I'm the new cheerleading coach.

10:02.551 --> 10:03.487
(laughs) Do you bop?

10:03.520 --> 10:05.285
(both laugh)

10:05.318 --> 10:08.515
(Australian accent):
Get to class, mates.

10:08.548 --> 10:10.681
I've been trying to sound
like Crocodile Dundee.

10:10.721 --> 10:14.516
Word of advice new Cheerios!
Coach, Sue Sylvester.

10:14.549 --> 10:16.883

(opera music playing)

10:54.267 --> 10:55.963
Get to class!

10:58.530 --> 11:00.337
That new cheerleading coach
is one scary dude.

11:07.506 --> 11:11.685
The moment I put that track suit
on, the world bowed before me.

11:11.718 --> 11:14.421
I had one made in every color.

11:14.454 --> 11:15.884
Maybe it's time for a change,
Coach.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.892
Everybody is scared of you now.

11:17.925 --> 11:20.061
It can't hurt
to girl it up a bit.

11:23.091 --> 11:24.856
(bell ringing)

11:27.161 --> 11:28.665
BRAD:
You're early.

11:28.698 --> 11:31.893
Geez! Oh, Brad! You scared
the crap out of me!

11:31.934 --> 11:33.563
Warn me before you talk!

11:34.795 --> 11:36.665
I'm sorry, man.
I'm having a bad week.

11:36.698 --> 11:40.230
Tell me about it. I can't stop
playing online blackjack.

11:40.263 --> 11:42.595
I owe thousands of dollars
to some very sketchy people.

11:42.628 --> 11:44.096
Why doesn't anyone
listen to me?

11:44.129 --> 11:45.863
I'm in 23 clubs!

11:45.896 --> 11:48.598
I probably would've been prom king if
this school didn't have so many stoners.

11:48.631 --> 11:51.871
And what's wrong with having
a solid game plan?

11:51.904 --> 11:53.333
My house is getting
foreclosed on.

11:53.366 --> 11:57.070
And get this, my fiancé
called me a "Puppet Master!"

11:57.110 --> 11:59.038
Well, if "pulling strings"

11:59.078 --> 12:01.709
means that I encourage people to
reach their fullest potential,

12:01.742 --> 12:04.718
then, hell yeah,
guilty as charged!

12:04.751 --> 12:09.947
Brad, if everyone just wants
me to sit down and shut up...

12:09.988 --> 12:12.784
that's exactly what
I'm gonna do.

12:12.817 --> 12:16.985
I'm gonna be right back here
in the back corner.

12:17.025 --> 12:21.956
Believe me, that'll
send a message...

12:23.461 --> 12:26.599
- loud... - PUPPET TINA:
<i>Blainey Days!</i>

12:26.632 --> 12:27.926
Blainey Days, wake up!

12:27.967 --> 12:30.363
We're sorry we didn't listen
to you earlier.

12:30.396 --> 12:31.829
Yeah, dawg. Our bad, yo!

12:31.870 --> 12:34.871
I'd love to say something really bitchy
or even downright cruel, but I can't,

12:34.904 --> 12:37.837
because you're clearly the most
talented teenager at this school!

12:37.870 --> 12:40.404
On this planet! Yeah, that's why
we're best friends, even though

12:40.445 --> 12:43.140
I'm straight and you're gay
and I'm blond and you're gay.

12:43.180 --> 12:44.507
May the Force be with you.

12:44.548 --> 12:45.978
Kids, I've got an awesome idea!

12:46.011 --> 12:50.388
This week's lesson is all about the
most inspiring guy we know: Blaine!

12:50.421 --> 12:52.252
(all cheer)

12:52.286 --> 12:54.253
Ooh, child,
Unique's got the blues!

12:54.294 --> 12:56.022
And the only way to cure 'em

12:56.063 --> 12:57.590
is to hear Blaine's
smooth-as-a-baby's-butt voice!

12:57.631 --> 12:59.125
Please, Blaine!

12:59.158 --> 13:01.534
Please?
Please?

13:01.568 --> 13:02.568
Yeah, Blaine!

13:02.601 --> 13:03.305
Really?

13:05.001 --> 13:07.609
Well, if you guys insist.
What should I sing?

13:07.642 --> 13:08.943
Oh, I know. Hit it!

Yeah, dude, you didn't say
a word the entire class.

15:12.954 --> 15:13.921
Didn't even sing.

Everyone stop.

15:40.216 --> 15:42.583
Look, I'm gonna do
you guys a favor. You suck,

15:42.624 --> 15:44.319
and I can't be bothered
to keep wasting my time.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.688

15:46.729 --> 15:49.225

we are doing 540s.

Oh, my God, her, too?

15:57.900 --> 16:00.330
All of them, actually.

16:03.267 --> 16:06.304
Jake, hey, uh, listen,
I just wanted to say thanks

16:06.335 --> 16:08.239
for sticking up for me
in Glee Club.

16:08.272 --> 16:10.144
Sometimes I feel like
I'm the only one

16:10.177 --> 16:12.809
that cares about pushing us
so we can nail it, you know?

16:12.842 --> 16:16.080
Yeah, I know, I mean, I'm
getting pretty sick of it, too.

16:16.113 --> 16:18.383
Um, I don't know how else
to say this, but...

16:18.416 --> 16:20.257
there's something's going on
in the choir room.

16:20.286 --> 16:24.713
I don't know if it's haunted or
like a space-time rift happening,

16:24.746 --> 16:29.759
but trust me, do yourself a
favor, sit in the back corner.

16:32.499 --> 16:33.970
It's crazy.

16:35.740 --> 16:39.045
Dance has never been our strong
suit, but I think with Jake's help,

16:39.078 --> 16:40.909
we can really kick it
up a notch. Jake?

16:40.942 --> 16:42.109
What's the point?

16:42.149 --> 16:43.316
I'm sorry?

16:43.349 --> 16:45.780
Seriously, what is the point?

16:45.813 --> 16:48.317
I could choreograph a sick
dance, none of you can keep up.

16:48.351 --> 16:51.422
I mean, half of you can't even
do it and won't even try. Why?

16:51.455 --> 16:52.485
Because you're not dancers.

16:52.526 --> 16:54.590
So let's not waste my time.

16:54.623 --> 16:57.861
Let's just do another cut-and-paste dance
routine that even Tina can pick up.

16:57.895 --> 16:59.597
You are such a conceited jerk.

16:59.630 --> 17:02.133
I'm not conceited, I'm bored.

17:02.166 --> 17:04.867
Please, we've seen
your dance moves.

17:04.901 --> 17:06.037
They're fine, not epic.

19:41.395 --> 19:45.662
about your snide, nasty
mouth and bad boy attitudes.

19:45.695 --> 19:46.726
Now clear out!

19:50.797 --> 19:52.596
(bell rings)

19:52.636 --> 19:53.836
Excuse me, Miss Alfano.

19:53.869 --> 19:56.971
As much as I've really enjoyed learning
about yarn these past three months,

19:57.004 --> 19:59.970
I was wondering, since Arts and
Crafts is my senior elective,

20:00.003 --> 20:03.272
if maybe I could do my own
thing and venture into felt

20:03.306 --> 20:06.242
and fabric and even
yarn and make a puppet?

20:06.275 --> 20:08.312
Your request surely begs
the question,

20:08.345 --> 20:13.349
"Why on earth would an 18-year-old
man want to make a puppet?"

20:13.382 --> 20:16.810
Well... it's not just any puppet...
It's a puppet of my fiancé.

20:16.850 --> 20:19.585
We're 600 miles apart, and even though
I get to see him tomorrow night,

20:19.618 --> 20:20.914
I'd really like
to see him right now,

20:20.954 --> 20:23.152
even though it might be
only in my imagination.

20:23.185 --> 20:25.852
Fine. Make a puppet.

20:28.251 --> 20:30.051
May I experiment with découpage?

20:30.084 --> 20:30.820
No.

20:34.328 --> 20:36.230
I forgave myself
a long time ago.

20:36.263 --> 20:38.701
I think it's time
I forgive you now.

20:38.734 --> 20:41.599
You are right.
Please forgive me.

20:41.639 --> 20:44.606
In this argument, I don't have
a leg to stand on.

20:44.639 --> 20:46.101
(laughs)

20:46.142 --> 20:47.837
(clomping footsteps)

20:56.151 --> 20:58.622
Hey, Principal... uh, Coach.

20:58.655 --> 21:02.453
Um, geez, are you okay?
Oh, what's with the shoes?

21:02.486 --> 21:04.123
Man, you have big feet.

21:04.156 --> 21:07.794
Well, I'm sorry if my femininity
threatens you. What is that?

21:07.827 --> 21:10.291
Did you just touch me
with a puppet?

21:10.332 --> 21:12.026
Oh, I made it in Crafts class.

21:12.059 --> 21:13.294
Get that thing out of here!

21:13.327 --> 21:14.829
I don't ever want
to see that thing

21:14.862 --> 21:17.891
in my hallway again! What?
You can't just ban puppets.

21:17.932 --> 21:19.659
Are you saying that
because of the shoes?

21:19.699 --> 21:21.425
Are you less afraid of me?

21:21.466 --> 21:25.029
In a few days' time
I am going to be evaluated

21:25.062 --> 21:26.764
on my abilities
to run this school.

21:26.797 --> 21:29.237
If the school board comes here
and sees schizophrenic students

21:29.268 --> 21:30.908
clearly off their meds
talking to puppets,

21:30.931 --> 21:33.297
they are gonna think I don't
have a handle on things.

21:33.330 --> 21:35.168
Well... Hey, hey! Kurt puppet!

21:35.201 --> 21:37.440
This is contraband. And if
I catch you with your hand

21:37.473 --> 21:40.702
up the butt of anything that isn't
human, you're in a world of trouble.

21:40.735 --> 21:42.806
But... Be careful.

21:42.839 --> 21:45.805
(grunts) Damn it!

22:08.314 --> 22:09.817
Sue, I... look,
I-I'm trying to work.

22:09.850 --> 22:12.051
Do you mind coming back in,
like, an hour to barge in here

22:12.085 --> 22:14.495
- without knocking and start insulting
me for no reason? - Oh, sure, sure, pal.

22:14.528 --> 22:16.063
I just, uh, I want to ask
you a question first.

22:16.096 --> 22:18.433
Um... you're an oddly
feminine man.

22:18.466 --> 22:19.666
What?

22:19.699 --> 22:21.605
Oh, please, you just
literally did a pirouette.

22:21.638 --> 22:24.078
Sue, just because a guy can dance
doesn't make him effeminate.

22:24.080 --> 22:26.544
That's what I'm saying.
When you dance, somehow

22:26.577 --> 22:28.879
you're able to maintain
your manliness.

22:28.912 --> 22:31.048
Here's the thing:

22:31.081 --> 22:35.954
Um... I happen to have a sizeable crush
on the handsomest man in the universe,

22:35.995 --> 22:37.426
Superintendent Bob Harris.

22:37.459 --> 22:39.164
I've had multiple
conversations with him.

22:39.197 --> 22:45.499
In fact, several days ago, I was quite
certain he was flirting with me.

22:45.532 --> 22:49.134
But it turns out all this
time he thought I was a man.

22:49.167 --> 22:52.037
I blame the Johnny Cash song,
"A Boy Named Sue."

22:54.343 --> 22:56.110
You know what they used
to say about Ginger Rogers?

22:56.143 --> 22:57.077
No.

22:57.111 --> 22:59.574
That she could lead her partner while
dancing backwards in high heels.

22:59.615 --> 23:02.647
I have no idea how that is
germane to this conversation.

23:02.681 --> 23:04.648
Ginger Rogers was
the pinnacle of femininity.

23:04.689 --> 23:07.782
I mean, she was one of the most
famous dancers in the world,

23:07.823 --> 23:11.624
and her partner was Fred Astaire, maybe
the greatest dancer of all time.

23:11.657 --> 23:14.126
Again, I don't know how this
pertains to what I'm talking about.

23:14.159 --> 23:17.526
The point is, Ginger Rogers did
everything Fred Astaire did...

23:17.567 --> 23:20.304
only she did it backwards
and in high heels.

23:20.337 --> 23:23.673
I mean, she managed to find a
way to be feminine and strong.

23:23.706 --> 23:26.606
Half the time when it looked like
Fred Astaire was leading her?

23:26.639 --> 23:27.638
She was leading him.

23:27.671 --> 23:29.142
Okay.
Tell you what.

23:29.175 --> 23:30.078
Let's make a deal.

23:30.111 --> 23:33.342
I'll teach you to lead while
dancing backwards in high heels,

23:33.382 --> 23:37.444
and you give me the $600 I need
for new costumes at nationals.

23:37.485 --> 23:39.882
Nope.
Forget it.

23:39.915 --> 23:41.346
I'm sorry, there's no way
in hell I'm going to give

23:41.387 --> 23:42.555
the Glee Club more
money for costumes

23:42.588 --> 23:44.556
until you can explain
to me how you paid for

23:44.589 --> 23:48.658
that 18-cubic-foot inflatable Lady Gaga
airbag that you strapped onto the back

23:48.691 --> 23:49.826
of the crippled
kid's wheelchair.

23:49.859 --> 23:52.129
That was at least
$1,000 right there, William.

23:52.162 --> 23:54.099
Fine.

23:54.133 --> 23:55.132
Suit yourself.

23:59.005 --> 24:00.236
(gas hissing)

24:00.269 --> 24:02.277
(sighs)

24:04.846 --> 24:06.140
Hey, doll.

24:06.181 --> 24:07.706

you and I cut a rug?

Wake up!

I've got to shop for
a mini-fridge for college!

26:24.091 --> 26:25.122
(grunts in frustration)

26:27.398 --> 26:29.366
(school bell ringing)

26:29.399 --> 26:31.334
Oh, God, let it go.
I don't want a girlfriend.

26:31.367 --> 26:33.005
Shut up.

26:33.038 --> 26:34.371
I don't want to be
your girlfriend, either.

26:34.404 --> 26:36.141
Then what?

26:36.174 --> 26:37.204
I'm late for class.

26:41.077 --> 26:43.149
I'm pregnant.

26:43.182 --> 26:44.981
With your baby.

26:45.014 --> 26:48.484
Bree, this is... All I'm
going to ask is that

26:48.517 --> 26:50.253
you come with me
to the doctor, okay?

26:50.286 --> 26:51.451
Wh-What are your parents
going to say?

26:51.492 --> 26:53.621
No... parents.

26:53.662 --> 26:55.628
This is staying between us.

26:56.996 --> 26:57.994
Forever.

26:58.027 --> 27:00.093
It's the right thing to do.

27:23.002 --> 27:25.000
(claps twice) Well, well, well.

If it isn't Miss Sally Field
in <i>Not Without My Puppet.</i>

27:27.474 --> 27:30.503
Did you really think I was
too stupid to suspect

27:30.544 --> 27:33.141
that you would come back here
under the cloak of darkness

27:33.174 --> 27:38.349
to claim your monstrous puppet-bride,
you strange, tiny, doe-eyed pervert?

27:38.382 --> 27:41.610
Kindly remove your fist
from Puppet Hummel's butt

27:41.651 --> 27:43.914
and place him gingerly
on the desk.

27:45.885 --> 27:48.926
And now report to detention
for the rest of the week.

27:48.959 --> 27:51.629
But I was supposed to fly to New
York to see Kurt's first big show.

27:51.662 --> 27:54.165
Well, then you're gonna have to
cancel Wonder Woman's invisible jet,

27:54.198 --> 27:55.765
or whatever magic discount

bullet train you kids use for
your weekly jaunts to New York.

27:58.735 --> 28:00.005
Now, get out of here.

28:00.039 --> 28:03.773
Go feel shame.

28:03.806 --> 28:07.447
♪

28:12.154 --> 28:15.222
Hi. Hey. Did you get your ticket
that I reserved for you, house-left?

28:15.263 --> 28:17.094
Kurt, I was gonna call you.

28:17.127 --> 28:21.431
Um, please don't be mad, but...
I'm not in New York, I'm in Lima.

28:21.464 --> 28:23.672
A-Are you kidding? What happened?
Did you miss your flight?

28:23.705 --> 28:25.905
- A-Are you okay?
- I-I'm fine.

28:25.938 --> 28:28.842
- I'm just, um...
- I'm just trying to explain.

28:28.875 --> 28:31.346
Yes, why don't you explain... and
it better be a good explanation.

28:31.379 --> 28:33.250
Well, Principal Sylvester
gave me detention,

28:33.283 --> 28:36.153
and she said if I tried to skip
it that she was gonna suspend me

28:36.186 --> 28:37.920
and put it on my permanent record.
Hang on.

28:37.953 --> 28:39.352
Whoa, whoa, wait one second.

28:39.385 --> 28:40.887
And you weren't
going to call me?

28:40.920 --> 28:43.686
I-I was trying my best
not to hurt you.

28:43.719 --> 28:45.558
All I did was steal back
the Kurt puppet

28:45.591 --> 28:47.157
- that I made in crafts class.
- Excuse me?

28:47.190 --> 28:49.091
The-the what puppet? What the
hell are you talking about?

28:49.124 --> 28:52.727
Uh, I-I know, it's, uh, it's kind of...
a weird story.

28:52.760 --> 28:54.223
But basically,
I was missing you.

28:54.256 --> 28:55.990
And is that how you see me?

28:56.031 --> 28:58.926
As a thing of felt and cloth and
button eyes that has no feelings,

28:58.967 --> 29:01.701
that you can play with and manipulate
and then discard whenever you're bored?

29:01.734 --> 29:02.997
- Oh, no.
- I'm a person, Blaine.

29:03.030 --> 29:05.672
I am flesh and blood and bone, and
this is a really big night for me,

29:05.705 --> 29:06.840
and I needed you to be here.

29:06.873 --> 29:09.742
(beep)
Kurt... (sighs)

29:10.943 --> 29:13.175
RACHEL:
Hey.

29:13.215 --> 29:15.047
We can release Blaine's seat.

29:15.080 --> 29:17.848
I don't think that's
gonna be necessary.

29:25.458 --> 29:26.625
One person?

29:26.658 --> 29:29.697
RACHEL: And he thinks Angela
Lansbury's performing.

29:29.730 --> 29:31.367
I told you so.

29:32.801 --> 29:35.169
(sighs)

29:39.356 --> 29:41.713
Let's be real for a second.

29:41.746 --> 29:44.050
I've never been all that
nice to you, and I don't

29:44.083 --> 29:46.887
really get whatever's...
going on with you,

29:46.928 --> 29:51.127
but I have to say, there's a part
of me that really admires it.

29:51.160 --> 29:56.713
When a woman of my stature needs a
makeover, she rings up all her best gays,

29:56.746 --> 30:00.587
but unfortunately, Porcelain, the
Sassy Toothless Elf, is in New York.

30:00.620 --> 30:05.215
So... God's most fabulous
mistake, I turn to you.

30:06.656 --> 30:09.592
I want to look more like a lady.

30:09.625 --> 30:14.899
Girl, I have already pulled out my
makeup kit... I got you, boo.

30:16.535 --> 30:20.405
Welcome, teen delinquents, to
detention, AKA "The Beck-fast Club,"

30:20.438 --> 30:22.206
named after Miss Becky Jackson,

30:22.239 --> 30:24.910
who has been here
more than any other <i>student.</i>

30:24.943 --> 30:26.511
Yeah, why is that?

30:26.544 --> 30:28.881
'Cause I like saying
bad words, <i>bitch!</i>

30:28.922 --> 30:33.465
Jacob X. Puckerman, you were
caught red-handed starting another

30:33.498 --> 30:37.572
exciting yet forbidden fistfight in the
William McKinley High School hallways.

30:37.605 --> 30:40.845
Why are you such
a mysterious musical bad boy?

30:41.775 --> 30:42.982
It is now 4:01.

30:43.016 --> 30:45.783
You have exactly eight hours
to ponder the horrific

30:45.816 --> 30:47.949
error of your pubescent ways.

30:47.982 --> 30:52.421
There will be no talking and no
monkeyshines, is that clear?

30:52.454 --> 30:53.757
Crystal.

30:55.662 --> 30:57.958
(door closes) You know, maybe
we could use this time

30:57.991 --> 31:00.063
to get to know each other
a little better.

31:00.096 --> 31:03.341
We could sit in a circle on
the floor and tell each other

31:03.374 --> 31:04.741
about our core wounds.

31:04.774 --> 31:06.573
Or you shut your hole.

31:06.613 --> 31:12.147
I'm going to college soon, I don't
have time for your lame-ass bull crap.

31:12.180 --> 31:14.316
(blows loud raspberry)

31:14.349 --> 31:16.020
(sighs)

31:19.296 --> 31:20.759
I'm sorry, Blaine Warbler.

31:20.792 --> 31:22.925
But that was totally
inappropriate.

31:22.958 --> 31:25.165
Please come sit with me.

31:25.198 --> 31:26.997
Sometimes I fly off the handle.

31:27.030 --> 31:30.533
Like yesterday, when I taped
Dottie's buns together.

31:30.566 --> 31:32.206
I did it for my old man.

31:32.239 --> 31:34.175
I wanted him to think
I was cool.

31:34.208 --> 31:36.309
That's really heavy, Becky.
Thanks for sharing.

31:36.342 --> 31:38.141
What's going on with <i>you,</i>
Blaine?

31:39.942 --> 31:43.315
Well, to tell the truth, guys, I
feel really, really guilty about

31:43.348 --> 31:44.916
missing Kurt's show in New York.

31:44.949 --> 31:47.750
Why? It's a stupid
cover band.

31:47.783 --> 31:51.487
And, dude, you go to New York all the
time... you were just there last week.

31:51.528 --> 31:53.893
True. But Kurt needs me.

31:53.926 --> 31:57.197
- We all need you, because
you are so awesome. - Yeah,

31:57.230 --> 31:58.997
you're America's gay sweetheart.

31:59.030 --> 32:00.334
Thanks, guys.

32:00.367 --> 32:02.703
You guys are, like,
my only real friends.

32:02.736 --> 32:05.168
But we're not real;
we're puppets.

32:05.208 --> 32:07.038
Maybe that's a bad thing.

32:07.071 --> 32:09.407
Maybe the fact that I can
only really feel like myself

32:09.440 --> 32:12.481
with friends I can
totally control is keeping me

32:12.514 --> 32:14.512
from really feeling like
I'm close to anyone.

32:14.553 --> 32:18.354
<i>Maybe</i> it's indicative
of a deeper intimacy issue.

32:18.387 --> 32:20.657
Or <i>maybe</i> everyone
should just wise up

32:20.690 --> 32:24.483
and start doing everything you se, because
you are so right on all the time.

32:24.524 --> 32:25.755
By the way, did
you notice you're

32:25.789 --> 32:27.829
now having puppet fantasies
outside the choir room?

32:27.862 --> 32:29.262
That's not normal.

32:29.295 --> 32:31.231
Seriously, you might
want to get a CAT scan.

32:31.264 --> 32:33.000
(knocking)

32:33.033 --> 32:34.372
Hello, hello.
Wake up. Hey.

32:34.405 --> 32:36.245
Will you cover for me, please?
I've got to leave early.

32:36.278 --> 32:38.380
Uh, y-yeah, sure. Why?

32:38.413 --> 32:40.581
It's not important. Later.

32:44.290 --> 32:45.720
Hey, so, are you ready to go?

32:45.753 --> 32:49.558
No need. The crimson tide
is rolling again.

32:50.927 --> 32:52.293
I got my period.

32:52.326 --> 32:53.589
I'm not pregnant.

32:53.629 --> 32:57.195
I guess I was just
late... this month.

32:57.228 --> 32:59.330
Are you serious?
That's awesome news.

32:59.363 --> 33:01.433
(exhales) Oh, I am so relieved.
<i>You're</i> relieved?

33:01.466 --> 33:04.499
Why? I was the one who had
to go to the doctor visit.

33:04.540 --> 33:06.667
No, I just mean that I'm
relieved that the whole thing

33:06.707 --> 33:08.803
is over, you know,
for the both of us.

33:08.843 --> 33:13.916
(sighs) Let me hit you with the blunt
instrument of reality, Puckerman.

33:13.949 --> 33:17.451
You're still you, a douchey playboy
who's gonna spend the rest of his life

33:17.484 --> 33:21.051
dealing with one mess after
another as long as he lives.

33:21.084 --> 33:24.587
One of these days, you are gonna
knock someone up, and I feel bad

33:24.620 --> 33:27.592
for whoever has to have a child
that shares your DNA.

33:27.625 --> 33:30.391
Hey, I'm gonna make
a great father one day.

33:30.424 --> 33:32.128
To who?

33:32.161 --> 33:34.464
Your seven kids
by seven different women?

33:35.496 --> 33:38.499
Not unless you change.

33:38.532 --> 33:41.866
Bree, look, I'm sorry, okay? I know
this whole thing was really scary

33:41.899 --> 33:45.597
- and traumatic... - Just do me a favor
and stay away from me from now on.

33:45.630 --> 33:47.629
You're toxic.

33:57.561 --> 33:58.967
Little known fact?

33:59.000 --> 34:02.135
McKinley saved a bundle on new
lockers by using recycled metal.

34:02.168 --> 34:04.334
These lockers
are actually Kalashnikovs

34:04.367 --> 34:08.338
that were melted down
during the war in Chechnya.

34:08.371 --> 34:14.478
(clears throat) Uh, Principal Sylvester, Yes.
I owe you an apology. I...

34:14.511 --> 34:20.380
I get in "business mode," and I may not
be that observant, so I... Well, I...

34:20.420 --> 34:23.222
might've overlooked
your more... feminine side.

34:23.255 --> 34:25.221
Oh. No worries, Superintendant.

34:25.254 --> 34:26.293
No worries.

34:26.958 --> 34:27.757
Please.

34:30.155 --> 34:35.156
(clicks tongue) And this... is the choir
room of McKinley's pride and joy,

34:35.188 --> 34:39.224
our national championship glee
club, the New Directions.

34:39.257 --> 34:43.828
Attention, McKinley School Board,
Sue Sylvester has put our children

34:43.870 --> 34:45.502
in grave danger.

34:45.534 --> 34:47.775
There is a gas leak in this room

34:47.809 --> 34:52.145
that is a direct result of Sue
Sylvester's failed leadership!

34:52.178 --> 34:56.646
No, there <i>was</i> a gas leak in
this room, but I fixed it.

34:56.679 --> 34:58.487
(whirring)

34:58.520 --> 35:01.058
<i>I know a gas-induced</i>
<i>fantasy dance sequence</i>

35:01.091 --> 35:03.550
<i>when I experience one.</i>

35:03.591 --> 35:07.250
And despite the fact that facilities
management is under your jurisdiction,

35:07.291 --> 35:11.426
Janitor Figgins, I found the
problem, I corrected it

35:11.459 --> 35:13.732
and now I'm cutting your pay
in half.

35:13.765 --> 35:16.467
WOMAN: Principal Sylvester,
we've seen enough.

35:16.500 --> 35:19.809
Yours is precisely the type
of leadership this school needs.

35:19.842 --> 35:22.548
The board would like to make you
principal on a permanent basis.

35:22.581 --> 35:24.043
Oh!
(chuckles)

35:24.084 --> 35:25.547
Congratulations, Sue.

35:25.580 --> 35:28.149
Oh, thank you so
much, Superintendant.

35:28.190 --> 35:31.083
How about we go out
and celebrate?

35:31.124 --> 35:32.187
Excuse me?

35:32.220 --> 35:34.492
Would you like to go out
on a date with me?

35:34.525 --> 35:36.293
Um... no.

35:37.294 --> 35:38.365
I don't want to do that.

35:38.398 --> 35:39.261
(coughs)

35:43.207 --> 35:45.336
Am I okay?

35:45.377 --> 35:49.481
I mean, is this what it feels
like to be losing your mind?

35:49.514 --> 35:50.680
I'm unraveling.

35:50.713 --> 35:52.343
I feel like Mel Gibson
in <i>The Beaver.</i>

35:52.384 --> 35:55.845
(high-pitched): More like
Mel Gibson in <i>Mad Max,</i>

35:55.879 --> 35:59.713
with your abs and your...
leather.

35:59.746 --> 36:00.983
Wait, what leather?

36:01.016 --> 36:02.815
The leather I was
imagining you in

36:02.848 --> 36:10.154
when I was rubbing vapor cream all
over your smooth... hairless... chest.

36:10.187 --> 36:13.153
(chuckling):
Tina, I'm engaged.

36:13.186 --> 36:16.821
- Hey, what's going on? - Uh... nothing.
I'm-I'm just, um, cleaning my head out.

36:16.854 --> 36:18.316
Just trying to figure
some stuff out.

36:18.357 --> 36:19.284
Is that supposed to be me?

36:19.325 --> 36:22.323
What?! That's...
that-that's crazy.

36:22.356 --> 36:24.859
She has Asian eyes
and my exact dress.

36:24.892 --> 36:26.227
Total coincidence.

36:26.260 --> 36:28.730
Not everything
is about you, Tina.

36:28.763 --> 36:30.226
What do you want?

36:30.266 --> 36:32.529
I just wanted to let you know
that everybody feels bad.

36:32.562 --> 36:34.865
We spent pretty much the
whole Glee session discussing

36:34.899 --> 36:37.571
how much pressure you're under
with nationals, graduation...

36:37.604 --> 36:40.981
The engagement. You were just trying to
exert some control. And the truth is,

36:41.014 --> 36:42.907
you should have some.
You've earned it.

36:42.948 --> 36:46.405
Sam suggested you should have the lead
on one of the songs at nationals.

36:46.446 --> 36:48.613
So we took a vote
and it was unanimous.

36:48.646 --> 36:51.677
Piano, a capella,
whatever you think is right.

36:51.718 --> 36:54.043
- Thanks, Tina.
- Of course.

36:54.083 --> 36:56.051
So if you're done being
a puppet master,

36:56.084 --> 36:58.421
do you think you could take your
hand out from under my dress?

36:58.454 --> 37:01.652
- Um...
- Yeah.

37:01.693 --> 37:04.830
- Um... - It's okay.
- Sorry about that.

37:04.864 --> 37:05.727
Thanks.

37:06.464 --> 37:09.502
I'm gonna miss having
a Kurt puppet though.

37:09.535 --> 37:11.799
He did anything I said.

37:11.840 --> 37:13.408
(high-pitched):
Anything?

37:13.441 --> 37:16.239
All right, settle down, Puppet Tina.
Okay. I get it. Blainey Days...

37:16.272 --> 37:19.248
Marley. Marley, Marley, please.

37:19.281 --> 37:20.713
Please just
listen. Please.

37:20.746 --> 37:22.547
30 seconds. Go.

37:22.588 --> 37:24.482
I miss you.

37:24.523 --> 37:25.818
Every minute of every day.

37:25.851 --> 37:28.227
And I know that I screwed
things up really badly,

37:28.260 --> 37:31.660
and I'm sorry. I know what I lost and
I know that I can't be without you.

37:31.693 --> 37:34.101
I need you. I don't want
to be this jerk anymore,

37:34.134 --> 37:36.797
and you are the only one who can
make me a better person.

37:36.837 --> 37:39.133
A good person.
I'm not here to fix you, Jake.

37:39.173 --> 37:41.668
I know, I know, I know.
That's why I'm here.

37:41.709 --> 37:44.941
To make it right, to make it
better, to make me better.

37:44.974 --> 37:49.615
I'm sorry, but we gave it a try and it...
just wasn't right.

37:49.648 --> 37:54.954
So after all that... you're saying
you don't have any feelings for me?

37:54.995 --> 37:56.995
(sighs)

38:00.069 --> 38:03.837
I think that you're
a good friend and teammate...

38:03.870 --> 38:06.942
Marley... but I just don't
feel the same as you.

38:06.975 --> 38:09.340
Not anymore.

38:09.373 --> 38:10.843
Marley, please.

38:11.675 --> 38:13.306
I got to get to class.

38:13.347 --> 38:15.212
I'll see you later in Glee Club.

38:18.985 --> 38:20.990
(school bell rings)

38:25.076 --> 38:27.397
Look, I know we don't know why
Kurt called this meeting.

38:27.430 --> 38:28.597
It's probably
to retire the band,

38:28.631 --> 38:30.511
but we can't rub it in and say,
"I told you so."

38:30.535 --> 38:31.502
That would be devastating.

38:31.535 --> 38:34.839
Well, I wouldn't do that, and I'm not gonna
let Kurt disband Pamela Lansbury.

38:34.872 --> 38:37.143
Look, I might not agree
with all of his decisions,

38:37.176 --> 38:39.407
but he is our leader
and he's an artist,

38:39.448 --> 38:41.709
and artists should be allowed
to fail.

38:41.742 --> 38:43.381
KURT:
Who says we failed?

38:43.414 --> 38:44.880
Cronuts, anyone?

38:44.921 --> 38:46.089
RACHEL:
Hi.

38:46.122 --> 38:48.153
Oh, this? No big deal.

38:48.186 --> 38:52.060
Just a little token from the booking
agency of the Williamsburg Music Hall,

38:52.093 --> 38:54.533
which is the location
of our second gig!

38:54.566 --> 38:56.196
What? Are you serious?

38:56.237 --> 38:59.835
- How? - Okay, true, we only had one
audience member at our last show,

38:59.868 --> 39:01.604
but it happened to be the
right audience member

39:01.637 --> 39:05.043
because, not only was he
a devoted Angela Lansbury fan,

39:05.076 --> 39:07.908
but he also liked what he saw,
made a secret bootleg

39:07.949 --> 39:10.349
and passed it along
to his nephew, who works at

39:10.383 --> 39:13.149
the Williamsburg Music Hall. The Williamsburg
Music Hall, which also just happens to be...

39:13.182 --> 39:14.748
One of the hottest venues
in Brooklyn.

39:14.789 --> 39:16.285
Good work, fearless leader.

39:16.318 --> 39:20.094
Well, it wasn't just me. It was...
also a lot of luck and-and you guys.

39:20.127 --> 39:23.795
Because, you know, whether Pamela
Lansbury implodes or explodes,

39:23.828 --> 39:26.133
I really have to thank you guys
for sticking by me.

39:26.166 --> 39:28.067
(knocking)

39:28.100 --> 39:29.929
Uh, package for Kurt Hummel.

39:29.962 --> 39:33.141
(grunts) Okay.

39:33.174 --> 39:35.204
KURT: Thank you. Thank you.

39:35.237 --> 39:37.204
Oh, it's from Blaine.

39:37.245 --> 39:40.815
He sends a gift to say sorry for missing
the performance the other night.

39:40.848 --> 39:41.912
RACHEL:
That's so nice!

39:44.286 --> 39:47.318
Okay, that is creepy as hell.

39:47.351 --> 39:48.917
Is there one for each of us?

39:51.021 --> 39:53.722
Guys, I just wanted
to apologize to all of you.

39:53.755 --> 39:57.594
I've been a little bit controlling
lately and it's not cool.

39:57.627 --> 40:01.132
I've made some changes though
and I've learned that sometimes

40:01.165 --> 40:03.667
you just need to let go.

40:03.700 --> 40:05.737
Cut the strings, so to speak.

40:05.770 --> 40:07.632
I bet you'll still
be bossy as hell.

40:07.665 --> 40:09.432
Actually, I hope to
be more of a leader,

40:09.473 --> 40:11.473
as opposed to being
just bossy, Kitty.

40:11.506 --> 40:14.612
So to celebrate this new
laissez-faire Blaine,

40:14.645 --> 40:19.055
I've made some felt
peace offerings.

40:20.657 --> 40:21.488
Voila.

40:21.521 --> 40:22.854
- What?
- Whoa!

40:22.887 --> 40:24.255
It has glasses!

40:24.296 --> 40:26.834
(indistinct chatter)

40:26.867 --> 40:27.866
I think we look alike.
