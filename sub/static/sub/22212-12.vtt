WEBVTT

00:08.258 --> 00:10.218
<i>Previously on</i> Riverdale:

00:10.301 --> 00:12.721
How many times
are we gonna push each other away?

00:14.347 --> 00:17.976
I know about the web-camming.
Can you show me how to do that?

00:18.059 --> 00:21.020
Serpent law
says you can't hurt one of your own.

00:21.604 --> 00:24.190
-No!

00:24.274 --> 00:27.861
We didn't evolve.
We were all slaughtered by Pickens.

00:27.944 --> 00:33.283
You interviewed my grandfather
for a history report, not some article.

00:33.867 --> 00:38.663
We can be proud to live in a Riverdale
where young people stand up for justice.

00:38.747 --> 00:42.417
I'll tell you about Veronica's parents
and the way they do things.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.711
Isn't this something
the Serpents would do?

00:45.795 --> 00:48.923
As long as you're dating Veronica,
I'll demand the best.

00:49.007 --> 00:52.594
How would you like to start your business
tutelage under my shepherding?

00:55.597 --> 00:57.807
<i>It's a classic trope of mob movies.</i>

00:57.891 --> 01:02.103
<i>Rich, High-rolling Gangster</i>
<i>takes Small Town Kid under his wing.</i>

01:02.604 --> 01:04.314
-Here you go.
-Thanks, Pop.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.774
<i>Small Town Kid...</i>

01:06.357 --> 01:10.195
<i>is ushered into an intoxicating,</i>
<i>but dangerous life of crime.</i>

01:10.278 --> 01:12.864
<i>Poppa, you don't need</i>
<i>to travel with a chef.</i>

01:12.947 --> 01:15.742
We have excellent poutine
here in Riverdale.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.620
Because I've tasted it, and it's superb.

01:19.329 --> 01:21.456
Hey, run this to your dad's trailer.

01:21.748 --> 01:24.542
Pick up some loafers resoled
at the Shoe Doctor.

01:24.626 --> 01:25.960
Happy to, Mr. Lodge.

01:29.964 --> 01:30.840
There he is.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.635
Sorry, Dad, guys.
Mr. Lodge has me all over town.

01:33.718 --> 01:36.387
I'll give you a ride home.
I'm done in 20 minutes.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.973
I've got my bike.
I got to pick up his shoes.

01:49.150 --> 01:50.193
Ronnie...

01:50.276 --> 01:53.613
That hem's high enough.
It's a confirmation, not a sock hop.

01:55.448 --> 01:57.826
<i>Usually, it happens</i>
<i>when you're 12 or 13,</i>

01:57.909 --> 02:01.037
but my parents wanted the same monsignor
who baptized me--

02:01.121 --> 02:04.457
Monsignor Murphy. He's a
friend of the family. --to confirm me.

02:04.541 --> 02:07.127
-It is.

02:07.210 --> 02:11.005
Especially to my mom and dad.
And, well, my whole family.

02:11.381 --> 02:12.924
A lot are coming for it.

02:13.007 --> 02:16.594
So, do you have to, like, memorize stuff?

02:17.554 --> 02:21.933
During the ceremony, Monsignor
will ask me to renounce Satan. I will.

02:22.016 --> 02:24.686
But otherwise,
you mostly do things in advance. Like picking a sponsor.
I asked my <i>abuelita</i>.

02:27.939 --> 02:32.652
And performing charitable works.
I'm volunteering at a soup kitchen.

02:32.735 --> 02:33.820
There she is.

02:34.195 --> 02:35.363
Let me look at you.

02:38.741 --> 02:42.537
My daughter confirmed
in front of my family. Our family.

02:42.620 --> 02:47.375
Oh, <i>mija</i>, you've made me the happiest...
The proudest father alive.

02:50.378 --> 02:53.590
Ahem. What do you think, Archie?
Isn't she a miracle?

02:55.842 --> 02:58.678
She is. She definitely is.

03:02.682 --> 03:05.143
Sheriff Keller, what a surprise.

03:05.226 --> 03:07.353
Jughead. FP.

03:07.437 --> 03:11.608
-Sorry to bother you, it's, uh--
-We do not have General Pickens' head.

03:11.691 --> 03:13.610
And we do not know who stole it.

03:13.693 --> 03:16.905
Same as the last four times
you asked us and our neighbors.

03:16.988 --> 03:20.491
Sheriff, these are starting
to feel a lot like harassment.

03:20.575 --> 03:25.121
There's absolutely no evidence,
zero proof whatsoever

03:25.204 --> 03:27.665
pointing to any particular group
of suspects.

03:27.749 --> 03:31.502
You did write a rather scathing article
about the general's legacy,

03:31.586 --> 03:36.257
which prompted the Southside Serpents to
stop by Pickens Day with an ax to grind.

03:36.341 --> 03:38.218
I'm actually writing a new article

03:38.301 --> 03:42.513
about how you seem to care more about
catching a vandal than the Black Hood.

03:43.389 --> 03:44.432
Can I get a quote?

03:51.356 --> 03:53.942
<i>Do I look good?</i>
Mm-hm.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.444

-Yeah.

03:58.071 --> 04:01.074
-<i>I love talking to you.</i>
-I like talking to you, too.

04:01.824 --> 04:04.452

-Maybe.

04:05.161 --> 04:07.747
Betty

04:07.830 --> 04:09.290
Why is the door locked?

04:10.416 --> 04:12.585
You know how I feel about locked doors.

04:14.545 --> 04:16.839
Yeah. You like to do the locking.

04:17.423 --> 04:20.927
-Jughead had questions about homework.

04:21.803 --> 04:24.555
-Well--

04:25.807 --> 04:28.685
I invited Archie,
but I want you guys there as well.

04:28.768 --> 04:33.523
Usually these kinds of events,
baptisms, confirmations, are family-only.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.733
But since it's all about me

04:35.817 --> 04:40.321
and you guys are my chosen family,
I pulled strings and reserved you a pew.

04:40.405 --> 04:43.324
Catholic chic.

04:43.408 --> 04:47.245
So, dresses for the girls, veils optional.
And coats and ties for the boys.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.497
<i>Jughead Jones and Betty Cooper,</i>

04:49.580 --> 04:51.582
<i>please report to the principal's office.</i>

04:51.666 --> 04:54.836
<i>Jughead Jones and Betty Cooper</i>
<i>to the principal's office.</i>

04:56.087 --> 05:00.300
Since your article attacking General
Pickens, among others, has come out...

05:01.092 --> 05:03.386
it's been a steady stream of outrage.

05:03.720 --> 05:09.642
Most recently, Hiram Lodge's lawyer,
a Mr. Sowerberry, has called

05:09.726 --> 05:12.312
saying his client's
considering legal action.

05:12.395 --> 05:16.149
-Defamation of character, Mr. Jones.

05:16.691 --> 05:20.778
Effective immediately, you are both
suspended from the newspaper staff.

05:20.862 --> 05:23.948
You have the day
to clean out your personal things.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.493
<i>I'm so sorry, Betty.</i>

05:27.577 --> 05:30.830
I don't care if they harass me
at home or school, but you--

05:31.956 --> 05:35.460
-You don't deserve this heat.

05:35.543 --> 05:37.795
Sheriff Keller. He has no proof,

05:37.879 --> 05:40.798
but he suspects one of the Serpents,
probably me,

05:40.882 --> 05:43.342
decapitated the statue of General Pickens.

05:44.302 --> 05:46.262
And did you?

05:46.345 --> 05:50.266
Betty, how
Why would I decapitate a bronze statue?

05:50.600 --> 05:53.019
Maybe the same reason
you wrote that article:

05:53.102 --> 05:55.688
to avenge Toni's grandfather.

05:57.648 --> 05:59.776
I mean, you and Toni are close.

05:59.859 --> 06:02.361
-Sure, we're pals.
-Close pals.

06:04.947 --> 06:06.991
I saw you guys at Pop's.

06:07.533 --> 06:11.996
Early one morning, in the middle
of the Black Hood attacks.

06:13.081 --> 06:17.877
You were having breakfast,
and you seemed like more than pals.

06:17.960 --> 06:20.254
And I know it's not my place to ask...

06:21.422 --> 06:24.550
but did anything ever happen
between you two?

06:26.677 --> 06:27.553
Yeah.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.556
The night of the Gauntlet.

06:30.640 --> 06:34.685
After you sent Archie to break up with me,
Toni stayed over.

06:36.521 --> 06:38.189
She gave me a...

06:40.525 --> 06:41.609
tattoo.

06:42.151 --> 06:46.489
And we did some stuff, but not everything.

06:46.572 --> 06:47.448
Uh-huh.

06:48.991 --> 06:52.745
But since you brought it up,
have you done anything with anyone?

06:52.829 --> 06:54.789
-No.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.208
No.

06:58.167 --> 06:59.377
Of course not.

07:03.631 --> 07:04.924
<i>Ooh-la-la.</i>

07:06.425 --> 07:08.636
-It is.

07:09.178 --> 07:12.306
It's a present from the St. Clairs,
of all people.

07:12.390 --> 07:15.226
Why would they think
they have the right to do that?

07:15.309 --> 07:19.397
-It's what families in our business do.

07:19.480 --> 07:22.233
Even when we're at war, we give gifts...

07:22.942 --> 07:26.696
to show respect. Or, in this case,
to try and make amends.

07:26.779 --> 07:29.907
Well, whatever it is,
feel free to burn or regift it.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.077
Veronica...

07:35.913 --> 07:39.125
Simone St. Clair called
to follow up on this gift.

07:39.667 --> 07:42.712
She said that Archie
paid Nick an unfriendly visit.

07:43.379 --> 07:44.422
Is that true?

07:45.756 --> 07:47.842
Sorry to make you check everything.

07:47.925 --> 07:51.179
Mr. Lodge's special orders
can get pretty complicated.

07:51.262 --> 07:54.390
No problem, Archie.
After all, he's the boss.

07:57.226 --> 07:58.853
What do you mean by that, Pop?

08:02.440 --> 08:03.399
Crap.

08:03.483 --> 08:07.612
-You cannot just show up at my house.
-I haven't heard from you in a while.

08:07.695 --> 08:10.531
-I've been calling and texting.
-Nothing to report.

08:10.615 --> 08:13.659
Your girlfriend's confirmation
isn't worth a mention?

08:13.743 --> 08:15.119
No, why would it be?

08:15.203 --> 08:18.915
Our sources are telling us
Hiram Lodge's family is coming to it.

08:19.457 --> 08:23.002
And by that, I mean his crime family.

08:23.544 --> 08:26.088
I need you to be my eyes and ears
at that event, Archie.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.633
Is there a problem?

08:28.716 --> 08:31.719
It's my girlfriend's confirmation.
It's a big deal.

08:31.802 --> 08:34.222
I want to be there for Veronica,
not the FBI.

08:34.972 --> 08:38.935
Unfortunately, Archie,
you'll have to be there for us both.

08:44.982 --> 08:48.611
Sheriff Keller,
we have to stop meeting like this.

08:48.819 --> 08:50.196
Where's your dad at?

08:50.279 --> 08:51.948
Had a shift at Pop's. Why?

08:52.990 --> 08:54.325
It's an eviction notice.

08:54.408 --> 08:58.538
You, your dad, pretty much everyone
in this place, you all gotta clear out.

08:58.621 --> 09:01.457
What? Don't tell me
this is because of that statue.

09:02.333 --> 09:06.671
For the millionth time, sheriff,
we did not decapitate General Pickens.

09:06.754 --> 09:10.299
And you can't use that
as some trumped-up excuse to evict us.

09:10.841 --> 09:14.971
Look, I'm just the messenger.
This order comes from the mayor.

09:15.054 --> 09:17.139
There's a lot of back rent owed here.

09:17.723 --> 09:19.433
You have 14 days to vacate.

09:19.934 --> 09:23.312
Perhaps while you're packing,
you might come across that head.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.855
Calm the waters a little.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.745
Sierra and Josie are here to--

09:39.829 --> 09:42.707
Offer an apology after Pickens Day.

09:44.834 --> 09:49.547
I had misgivings about some
of the decisions your parents were making.

09:49.630 --> 09:51.924
That was wrong and inappropriate.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.802
These are stressful times, Sierra.

09:55.219 --> 09:58.264
And neither Veronica nor I
hold any grudges.

09:58.347 --> 10:02.768
Not at all. In fact, I would love it
if you'd both come to my confirmation.

10:04.895 --> 10:08.608
Veronica, Hermione,
we accept your invitation.

10:08.691 --> 10:11.277
It makes giving you your gift
that much easier.

10:11.652 --> 10:12.528
Josie?

10:14.238 --> 10:18.075
If you'll have me, I'd be honored
to sing at your confirmation, Veronica.

10:18.159 --> 10:20.870
-You don't have to.
A lovely idea.

10:20.953 --> 10:23.039
-We accept.
-Mom, I was gonna sing.

10:23.789 --> 10:25.374
Or we could do a duet.

10:27.460 --> 10:31.422
Do you know "Bittersweet Symphony"
from the <i>Cruel Intentions</i> soundtrack?

10:33.591 --> 10:34.675
I can learn it.

10:40.848 --> 10:44.226
We all got the eviction notices,
but I swear to you,

10:44.310 --> 10:46.520
no one is going anywhere.

10:46.937 --> 10:51.859
The heat's been on us since Pickens Day,
and they are using that damn statue

10:52.401 --> 10:54.153
as an excuse to turn it up.

10:55.404 --> 10:58.366
But if we're gonna fix this, I gotta ask:

10:58.449 --> 11:02.870
Is anyone in this room responsible
for cutting off Pickens' head?

11:02.953 --> 11:06.332
Why don't you ask your son
what he has to say?

11:06.415 --> 11:11.212
-You wrote the article that started this.

11:11.754 --> 11:15.216
You and your posse
fired the opening shot at Pickens Day.

11:15.299 --> 11:18.594
-It was a peaceful protest.
-That accomplished nothing.

11:18.677 --> 11:22.681
What's to say you didn't go back
that night with a ladder and hacksaw?

11:22.765 --> 11:25.726
Hey, we didn't do it. Hell, Tall Boy...

11:25.810 --> 11:28.187
you're the tallest.
You wouldn't even need a ladder.

11:28.270 --> 11:33.776
Jughead, Tall Boy, the last thing we need
right now is it to turn on each other.

11:34.318 --> 11:36.737
Hey, we'll find a way out of this.

11:38.656 --> 11:39.865
I heard a rumor...

11:41.033 --> 11:44.412
that you paid Nick St. Clair a visit
and roughed him up a bit.

11:47.998 --> 11:49.750
The thing is, Mr. Lodge, I...

11:51.085 --> 11:54.755
When I found out what Nick tried
to do with Veronica, I just, I got...

11:55.506 --> 11:57.299
-so angry.
-But still...

11:58.509 --> 11:59.802
Beating up on a kid,

12:00.302 --> 12:02.638
even a filthy animal like Nick St. Clair,

12:03.222 --> 12:05.433
while his legs are in casts?

12:07.518 --> 12:08.477
I'm...

12:09.812 --> 12:11.355
impressed.

12:13.190 --> 12:14.024
No...

12:15.109 --> 12:18.320
I respect a man that will go
to such extremes to send a message.

12:18.863 --> 12:22.825
And I'm relieved that Veronica
has someone so fiercely protective.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.119
Of course, sir, always.

12:26.454 --> 12:30.249
I have some out-of-town guests coming in
for Veronica's confirmation.

12:30.332 --> 12:32.543
I'm hosting a poker game the night before.

12:32.626 --> 12:36.672
I'll need a couple extra hands to help.
Someone I can trust.

12:36.964 --> 12:40.092
You know, to keep the drinks filled
and the cigars cut.

12:40.926 --> 12:41.969
Are you interested?

12:43.846 --> 12:47.057
Absolutely, sir. I'll be there.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.443
Chic

13:00.654 --> 13:04.867
Where's Chic?
-I'm Ben. Chic will be right down.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.285
See you.

13:09.955 --> 13:14.043
-Hey, I thought you had a job interview.
-I did. That was Ben.

13:14.376 --> 13:17.463
He works at the Bijou.
Pretty sure I got the job.

13:17.963 --> 13:20.299
I thought he might be one of your clients.

13:20.382 --> 13:24.720
I'd never tell those guys where I live.
And don't you do it, either. Ever.

13:24.803 --> 13:26.222
-I wouldn't.
-Good.

13:26.305 --> 13:29.183
Boundaries are key.
They'll keep you alive.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.646
<i>This witch-hunt has to end, mayor.</i>

13:33.729 --> 13:36.482
Serpents had nothing to do
with that beheading.

13:36.565 --> 13:40.402
In the meantime, you'll send
Sheriff Keller to sow seeds of unrest,

13:40.486 --> 13:42.404
threaten to take our homes away?

13:42.488 --> 13:45.115
Since when do you care about a statue?

13:45.199 --> 13:48.494
Since Governor Dooley called
and read me the riot act.

13:48.577 --> 13:51.372
That statue cost him a lot of money.
He's furious.

13:51.455 --> 13:53.916
You're supposed to be an ally,
Mayor McCoy.

13:54.792 --> 13:57.002
So, why are you doing this? Unless it's...

14:01.465 --> 14:02.967
Who's pulling your strings?

14:04.093 --> 14:07.137
-You're a bright kid, Jughead.

14:07.221 --> 14:08.430
I've always liked you.

14:08.847 --> 14:11.600
So, listen to what I'm telling you:

14:12.685 --> 14:15.020
Back down.

14:21.902 --> 14:24.947
What do you mean
my dad invited you to his poker game?

14:25.573 --> 14:29.994
No, not to play. Just to, like, serve
drinks and bus tables and cut cigars.

14:30.077 --> 14:32.705
-Whatever that means.
-Those games are private.

14:32.788 --> 14:34.331
Daddy's inner-inner-circle.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.667
-Hi.
-Well, guess I'm in.

14:37.167 --> 14:39.628
Unless there's a reason
why I shouldn't go.

14:41.547 --> 14:42.965
Come here. Excuse me.

14:47.303 --> 14:50.973
This floating poker game
is a long-standing tradition.

14:51.056 --> 14:52.808
It's been happening for decades.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.895
It's high-stakes,
in every sense of the word.

14:55.978 --> 14:59.148
You have to be extremely careful
around these players.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.859
I just don't want you to get hurt.

15:01.942 --> 15:05.154
Why would I get hurt? I thought
these were friends and relatives.

15:05.237 --> 15:07.406
They are, but... they're like Daddy.

15:08.198 --> 15:11.869
They're old-school industry titans
you don't want to cross.

15:12.036 --> 15:15.998
Just... promise me you'll play it safe.

15:16.081 --> 15:20.210
Ronnie, I'm refilling water. I don't think
there's anything to worry about.

15:26.133 --> 15:28.135
<i>Thank you for meeting with me.</i>

15:29.428 --> 15:32.056
You're the only person
I can talk to about this.

15:32.139 --> 15:34.975
Before you do,
can I just point out one thing?

15:35.059 --> 15:37.102
I know what you're gonna say.

15:38.145 --> 15:40.898
Last time the Serpents were in trouble,
I pushed you away.

15:41.982 --> 15:43.192
What do you need, Jug?

15:43.692 --> 15:47.988
Mayor McCoy thinks the Serpents
vandalized the statue of General Pickens.

15:48.072 --> 15:52.034
And now, suddenly, we have 14 days
to vacate Sunnyside Trailer Park.

15:52.117 --> 15:54.286
What? That's illegal.

15:54.370 --> 15:58.624
The trailer park's on town property,
and not everyone's paid their rent.

15:58.707 --> 16:00.876
-Let's go talk to Mayor McCoy.
-I did.

16:00.960 --> 16:06.131
She's making this about the statue,
and it's just a pretense to shut us up.

16:06.298 --> 16:10.135
If the statue's what's fueling her fire,
then let's take away the gas.

16:10.552 --> 16:12.680
The Case of the Decapitated Statue.

16:13.222 --> 16:17.810
Treat this like a missing person case.
Someone must have seen something.

16:18.102 --> 16:22.272
So, we'll canvass the town with reward
flyers for anyone who has information.

16:22.356 --> 16:25.484
Finding the head will take
the wind out of McCoy's sails.

16:26.026 --> 16:30.030
-So...
-Find the head, save the trailer park.

16:32.241 --> 16:35.285
You invited Archie
to work your Casino Royale?

16:35.869 --> 16:39.456
Aren't you worried he's gonna
find out all our family secrets?

16:39.540 --> 16:44.086
Business isn't discussed for such
sacred celebrations as your confirmation.

16:44.169 --> 16:47.256
You always have an agenda, Daddy.
What is it this time?

16:47.339 --> 16:50.175
After hearing about how Archie
took initiative with Nick,

16:50.259 --> 16:52.553
I wanted
to see how he would handle himself

16:52.636 --> 16:55.597
-in a room of my peers.

16:55.681 --> 16:59.018
He's your boyfriend, <i>mija</i>,
and if this relationship persists,

16:59.101 --> 17:02.104
at some point,
we may need to bring Archie in.

17:02.688 --> 17:06.233
I thought outsiders weren't brought
in to the family.

17:06.316 --> 17:10.571
Not traditionally. Archie might be
more like us than I gave him credit for.

17:10.654 --> 17:11.822
No, he's not.

17:13.282 --> 17:17.369
And I'm not sure I want him
to be compromised.

17:20.414 --> 17:21.373
I see.

17:22.249 --> 17:24.626
But if things keep going
as they have been,

17:25.252 --> 17:27.337
you're gonna have to make a decision.

17:27.713 --> 17:30.924
Either bring him in,
or he stays on the outside forever.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.720
All right, Order of the Ophidians...

17:37.389 --> 17:38.640
Jughead Jones.

17:40.684 --> 17:43.145
Did you really think
you'd seen last of me?

17:43.812 --> 17:46.106
What's the Snake Charmer doing here

17:46.190 --> 17:50.444
-No, I brought her in to help us.
-We don't Penny's kind of help.

17:50.527 --> 17:52.404
You don't get a say anymore.

17:52.613 --> 17:55.741
Not since you broke Serpent law
and hurt one of our own.

17:55.824 --> 17:59.411
Penny was about to tell your dad.
Show him, Penny.

18:01.205 --> 18:02.498
Show them all.

18:08.003 --> 18:09.963
That used to be my Serpent tattoo,

18:10.464 --> 18:15.094
until your son sliced my arm and
left me bleeding in a ditch in Greendale.

18:16.804 --> 18:19.389
But I'm still willing
to help the Serpents.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.559
Tall Boy showed me those eviction notices.
They're legit.

18:23.519 --> 18:27.231
But, luckily, I can think of about 41 ways
to stall the process.

18:27.314 --> 18:28.649
And I'm talking years.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.528
Blood for blood.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.154
An eye for an eye.

18:35.614 --> 18:39.409
I want back in with the Serpents,
and I want him kicked out.

18:41.286 --> 18:43.163
Oh, yeah, one last thing.

18:44.665 --> 18:46.500
I want his tattoo carved off.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.503
And I want to do it myself.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.089
With a dirty knife.

19:01.265 --> 19:04.601
Well
Are they kicking me out?

19:04.685 --> 19:06.019
There's gonna be a vote.

19:06.854 --> 19:09.481
-You versus Penny.

19:09.565 --> 19:12.693
They can't see what we get
with Penny in the picture?

19:12.776 --> 19:16.405
Penny's a cobra, but mutilating her?

19:18.240 --> 19:20.659
That's a thing you don't
come back from, Jug.

19:20.742 --> 19:23.537
Yeah, like stuffing a teenager's body
in a freezer?

19:23.620 --> 19:26.165
You need to learn
to keep your damn mouth shut.

19:26.874 --> 19:29.793
Tall Boy was right.
You brought the Northside down on us.

19:29.877 --> 19:32.713
Serpents are losing their dens
because of what you wrote.

19:32.796 --> 19:34.423
Don't kid yourself.

19:36.592 --> 19:38.343
They're using my article.

19:39.052 --> 19:42.222
They're using what happened
to the statue of Pickens

19:42.306 --> 19:45.225
as an excuse to justify
something they've already been doing.

19:45.309 --> 19:48.937
You think you're a hero, Jug?
Cutting up women?

19:49.688 --> 19:52.399
Bringing the temple down
right on our damn heads?

19:55.194 --> 19:58.113
You... will be the death of us.

19:59.615 --> 20:02.201
Not the Northside. Not Penny.

20:03.410 --> 20:04.286
You.

20:08.999 --> 20:12.211
Are you out of your mind?
I'm not wearing a wire.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.171
Archie, this poker game.

20:14.254 --> 20:16.423
All the kingpins, together in one room.

20:16.506 --> 20:21.720
We've never managed to get anyone
to hear and record what they discuss.

20:21.803 --> 20:24.056
Okay, hear, yes. Record, no.

20:24.139 --> 20:27.559
You afraid we might capture something
implicating your father?

20:27.643 --> 20:31.688
-I'm taking the risk here, not you.

20:32.314 --> 20:34.983
We're doing this on my terms. No wire.

20:40.405 --> 20:43.909
I told you, Alice.
Either Chic goes or I go.

20:43.992 --> 20:46.370
Chic isn't hurting anyone.
And he got a job.

20:46.453 --> 20:48.247
-The Bijou.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.791
And he's offered to pay rent.

20:50.874 --> 20:53.877
-He's a stranger. That's my beef.
-So, make an effort.

20:53.961 --> 20:57.589
-Get to know him.

20:57.673 --> 21:03.095
Why don't you call me when he's gone.
I'll be at a ShareBNB by the <i>Register</i>.

21:03.178 --> 21:05.264
Fine, Hal, do what you want.

21:12.437 --> 21:14.731
<i>Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.</i>

21:15.691 --> 21:18.360
<i>It's been some time</i>
<i>since my last confession.</i>

21:19.778 --> 21:22.322
<i>The bible says gossiping's a sin.</i>

21:22.406 --> 21:24.491
<i>If that's true, guilty.</i>

21:25.325 --> 21:28.870
<i>Also, I admit to being, on occasion...</i>

21:29.705 --> 21:31.581
<i>disrespectful to my parents.</i>

21:32.582 --> 21:35.210
<i>But what I'm most worried about is...</i>

21:36.837 --> 21:38.839
that I'm doing something terrible...

21:40.048 --> 21:41.341
to a person I love.

21:44.261 --> 21:47.097
Not only am I constantly lying to him...

21:48.265 --> 21:51.852
or, more accurately,
withholding the truth...

21:53.353 --> 21:56.773
I fear I'm leading him
down an unrighteous path.

22:00.027 --> 22:05.157
Monsignor, as someone who's known
my family for longer than I've been alive,

22:05.240 --> 22:07.075
I hope you understand my concern.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.995
I do, my child.

22:10.078 --> 22:13.165
And I pray you can offer some advice.

22:14.124 --> 22:16.752
Ten Hail Mary's and five Our Father's.

22:24.301 --> 22:28.055
Veronica, how did your confession
with the Monsignor go?

22:29.056 --> 22:32.684
To be honest, <i>Tia</i>, I don't know
if he gave me much peace of mind.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.980
Me, I go to Our Lady of Grace every day.

22:37.064 --> 22:40.108
I light a candle
and put in my requests to the All Mighty.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.198
For protection.

22:46.990 --> 22:49.117
Our husbands

22:49.826 --> 22:52.204
Every day they come home, it's a miracle.

22:52.287 --> 22:53.246
Mm.

22:53.371 --> 22:55.082
For me, I pray for forgiveness.

22:55.624 --> 22:58.877
I have everything.
My husband, your uncle, he's good to me.

22:58.960 --> 23:01.588
And so I pray for him,
and for me and the kids.

23:02.464 --> 23:05.592
And I also give to charities.
It helps me sleep at night.

23:06.635 --> 23:10.472
-You have to find your thing, Veronica.
-I'm trying.

23:11.681 --> 23:14.768
-It was.

23:14.851 --> 23:16.603
His name's Archie Andrews.

23:16.937 --> 23:19.064
And do we know him

23:19.689 --> 23:21.108
He's a local boy.

23:21.691 --> 23:23.819
An... <i>inocente</i>.

23:36.748 --> 23:39.167
Full house, aces over sixes.

23:39.251 --> 23:43.296
-You're on a lucky streak, Hiram.
-That, or he's cheating us, Carl.

23:47.092 --> 23:48.552
Kid's got hustle.

23:49.386 --> 23:50.595
What's your name, red?

23:52.097 --> 23:52.931
Archie Andrews.

23:53.014 --> 23:55.725
Archie, Lenny Kowalski runs
canned meat out of Chicago.

23:55.809 --> 23:59.437
-They call me "The Butcher."
-No one calls him that.

23:59.521 --> 24:03.358
Carl Martin, of Martin Brewery.
Finest beer in the Rust Belt.

24:03.441 --> 24:05.569
I wouldn't say the finest.

24:05.652 --> 24:07.696
This charming fellow
is Poppa Poutine.

24:07.779 --> 24:10.031
He owns hot dog restaurants in Quebec,

24:10.115 --> 24:12.284
which is why you've never heard of him.

24:13.410 --> 24:17.080
How's SoDale coming along, Hiram?
Right on schedule?

24:17.164 --> 24:19.291
No business talk, remember, Poppa?

24:21.918 --> 24:25.088
-Archie.

24:25.172 --> 24:26.590
Archie Andrews.

24:26.673 --> 24:29.885
Andrews, right. Hiram,

24:30.427 --> 24:33.346
doesn't your wife
know a guy named Andrews?

24:35.765 --> 24:37.184
Yeah, she does.

24:38.935 --> 24:41.521
Fred Andrews is one
of our business associates.

24:42.397 --> 24:46.193
Was that your decision
to make him a partner, or hers?

24:50.238 --> 24:51.740
Smells delicious, Pop.

24:51.823 --> 24:55.493
Don't get a chance to make poutine
very often. I hope you enjoy it.

24:57.120 --> 25:00.290
What the hell is this?
Those aren't cheese curds!

25:00.373 --> 25:04.294
I ordered poutine. This is vomit.
You own this dump?

25:04.377 --> 25:05.295
No.

25:06.421 --> 25:07.505
I own it.

25:08.465 --> 25:09.591
Now apologize.

25:10.675 --> 25:12.219
Apologize for what?

25:13.345 --> 25:14.888
For disrespecting Pop Tate.

25:19.309 --> 25:21.770
I'm gonna go out
and get a little fresh air.

25:22.312 --> 25:23.605
This place is a dive.

25:29.361 --> 25:30.695
I'm sorry, Pop.

25:31.112 --> 25:33.907
If you'll excuse
my guest's lack of social graces.

25:38.662 --> 25:40.038
Toilet's clogged.

25:42.999 --> 25:44.209
Enjoy your steak.

25:47.170 --> 25:48.129
Oh, God.

25:50.966 --> 25:53.718
Lodge is a problem. Mm-hm.

25:54.344 --> 25:56.471
He lost his mojo in the joint.

25:59.391 --> 26:01.017
He went soft in the head,

26:01.101 --> 26:02.435
and in the belly.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.313
Others back home feel the same way.

26:07.107 --> 26:11.111
And Lodge is getting sloppy, too.
That whole St. Clair kid thing?

26:11.194 --> 26:15.448
Exactly. Going after someone's kid
in such a blatant way

26:17.575 --> 26:21.579
And partnering up with the man
who's been messing around with your wife?

26:21.663 --> 26:22.539
He's weak.

26:23.456 --> 26:25.625
This is our chance, Lenny.

26:26.751 --> 26:28.461
You think he should be removed?

26:30.714 --> 26:32.924
Right after his daughter's confirmation.

26:34.092 --> 26:35.343
