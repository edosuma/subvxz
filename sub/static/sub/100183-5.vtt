WEBVTT

00:01.697 --> 00:02.785
Previously
onBlack Lightning...

00:02.828 --> 00:04.569
Your body has reverted

00:04.613 --> 00:08.008
to its natural age and
is experiencing withdrawal
from the serum

00:08.051 --> 00:12.229
that's kept you virile
for the last 30 years.

00:12.273 --> 00:13.839
I'm Brandon. I'm new,

00:13.883 --> 00:16.538
and I was told to ask
Jennifer Pierce for a tour.

00:16.581 --> 00:18.235
Tavon Singley,
I'm gonna need you
to come with us.

00:18.279 --> 00:21.108
There's been a report
of meta-human powers
being displayed.

00:21.151 --> 00:23.414
What? No, that's not true.

00:23.458 --> 00:24.937
Straight through these trees.

00:24.981 --> 00:26.287
The Perdi, they'll have
a truck there waiting for you.

00:26.330 --> 00:27.766
But I'm not even a meta.

00:27.810 --> 00:29.942
Until we can prove otherwise,
this is the safer way.

00:29.986 --> 00:31.857
I was able to put
a radioactive resin

00:31.901 --> 00:33.990
on the tires of
several ASA vehicles.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.514
This will allow us to track
their frequently
traveled routes,

00:36.558 --> 00:38.299
until they lead us to the Pit.

00:38.342 --> 00:40.649
The results have been
nothing short of remarkable.

00:40.692 --> 00:44.305
Every person who was infected
is on their way to making
a full recovery.

00:44.348 --> 00:45.741
She's hooked.

00:45.784 --> 00:47.830
I only saw to it
that she got a taste

00:47.873 --> 00:51.051
of the most addictive substance
on Earth.

00:52.182 --> 00:53.357
You have the ability
to do things

00:53.401 --> 00:54.967
your father could never do,
Ms. Pierce.

01:14.683 --> 01:17.338
I can see
the constellations
from here, Dad.

01:17.381 --> 01:18.817
They just like you said
they'd be.

01:20.254 --> 01:23.909
Hi, Ma. Look, don't worry.
I'm okay.

01:23.953 --> 01:27.087
But if it wasn't for
Blackbird saving me
when somebody at school

01:27.130 --> 01:28.958
lied about me
being a meta,

01:29.001 --> 01:32.092
I'd probably still be rotting
in that ASA concentration camp.

01:33.223 --> 01:34.616
I don't know where I am,

01:34.659 --> 01:38.620
but here, humans and metas
live and work together.

01:38.663 --> 01:40.926
Mr. Pierce said that
Freeland was our community.

01:41.449 --> 01:42.624
We help each other.

01:43.233 --> 01:45.453
All boats rise.

01:46.410 --> 01:49.109
But that ASA occupation,
it changed us,

01:49.152 --> 01:51.198
turned us against each other.

01:51.241 --> 01:53.635
They say that
in every revolution,

01:53.678 --> 01:55.550
there's one man with a vision.

01:55.593 --> 01:57.029
I thought that was
Black Lightning.

01:58.161 --> 01:59.771
But after being here,

01:59.815 --> 02:01.947
I think the only way
to save Freeland

02:01.991 --> 02:03.166
is if humans and metas

02:03.210 --> 02:05.560
work together side by side
to stop the ASA.

02:06.474 --> 02:08.867
Maybe then I can come home.

02:09.999 --> 02:11.131
Look, I love y'all both.

02:41.073 --> 02:42.510
Interesting.

03:12.017 --> 03:14.672
Are we dancing or
are we sparring,
you meta freak?

03:44.615 --> 03:46.661
That fun exploding
heart technique.

03:50.752 --> 03:52.057
Take five steps...

03:53.145 --> 03:54.103
and boom.

03:55.322 --> 03:56.584
Are you serious?

03:57.280 --> 04:00.805
No, no, I'm not serious.

04:00.849 --> 04:02.546
Downloaded Black Belt Theater
last night.

04:02.590 --> 04:05.201
I mean, what's knowledge
without a little culture.
Am I right?

04:06.811 --> 04:09.466
-Oh, that's right.

04:09.510 --> 04:11.076
My venom coursing through
your veins right now

04:11.120 --> 04:12.991
must make it difficult
for you to think.

04:24.873 --> 04:26.266
Do you have kids, Sergeant?

04:27.528 --> 04:29.399
A religious man, perhaps?

04:29.443 --> 04:32.707
You see, I often
ponder my victims'

04:32.750 --> 04:34.361
last thoughts before they die.

04:35.405 --> 04:36.841
And the truth is...

04:38.365 --> 04:39.583
it's fascinating to me.

04:42.412 --> 04:44.327
That's enough!

04:44.371 --> 04:47.765
Have the infirmary administer
the antivenom immediately.

04:47.809 --> 04:49.114
Yes, sir.

04:55.338 --> 04:56.296
Painkiller.

05:00.125 --> 05:02.389
The vigilante
known as Blackbird

05:02.432 --> 05:04.129
has become a high-value target.

05:04.173 --> 05:08.308
This is a problem
that requires your attention.

05:11.746 --> 05:14.139
♪ Last night I saw a superhero He was black ♪

05:14.183 --> 05:17.012
♪ He said
"This is for the street
Black Lightning's back" ♪

05:27.718 --> 05:29.807
Your vitals are spiking, Erica.
How do you feel?

05:34.203 --> 05:35.813
I'm okay, Dr. Stewart.

05:35.857 --> 05:38.294
I'm gonna ask you
to push yourself now.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.122
Let your power absorb
the kinetic energy,

05:40.165 --> 05:41.993
but don't release it
until I say, okay?

05:55.616 --> 05:56.704
Now.

06:20.728 --> 06:22.033
Lynn.

06:23.165 --> 06:24.122
You okay?

06:25.428 --> 06:26.560
I didn't mean to wake you up.

06:26.603 --> 06:28.953
You should... You should
go back to sleep.

06:28.997 --> 06:29.911
I'm fine.

06:31.913 --> 06:34.829
Wait. Are you going somewhere?

06:36.091 --> 06:37.005
The curfew.

06:40.922 --> 06:42.880
Curfew doesn't apply
to the ASA.

06:43.968 --> 06:46.275
I need to go to the lab.
You should get some sleep.

06:51.454 --> 06:52.412
I know that look.

06:55.676 --> 06:57.504
What look would that be?

06:57.547 --> 07:00.420
An afterglow,
a midnight epiphany.

07:01.638 --> 07:03.074
All right, so...

07:03.118 --> 07:04.467
when can I expect to see you?

07:04.511 --> 07:06.469
Like two, three days a week?

07:07.949 --> 07:10.255
I cured the meta-virus,
but this occupation won't end

07:10.299 --> 07:12.519
until I stabilize
the meta-gene itself.

07:12.562 --> 07:14.521
I'm close.
I have all the pieces.

07:14.564 --> 07:15.957
I just... If I can
decipher them.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.915
I just need to get to the lab
and run some tests.

07:17.959 --> 07:19.395
Okay, okay. I love you.

07:23.791 --> 07:24.966
I love you too.

07:38.675 --> 07:40.372
Good evening,
citizens of Freeland.

07:40.416 --> 07:43.506
Truthteller Johnson
with another Resistance Alert

07:43.550 --> 07:45.377
tailored especially for you.

07:47.945 --> 07:49.730
There are rumors
spread by the ASA

07:49.773 --> 07:52.689
claiming the recent assault
on our very own Precinct 13

07:52.733 --> 07:55.213
was made
by those evil Markovians.

07:57.825 --> 07:59.479
Don't believe the hype.

08:00.871 --> 08:03.134
What the ASA
doesn't want you to know

08:03.178 --> 08:06.790
is they were illegally holding citizens of Freeland.

08:06.834 --> 08:10.402
It was the Blackbird herself
who risked life and limb
to save them.

08:10.446 --> 08:13.101
And it's to her,
we raise our glass tonight.

08:13.144 --> 08:15.582
Stay safe out there.
That's the truth.

08:15.625 --> 08:16.974
I had some help,
but I'll take it.

08:17.018 --> 08:18.454
Hope you can handle it.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.543
This is Truthteller Johnson
signing off.

08:32.163 --> 08:34.078
The school bell
is ringing, young lady.

08:40.650 --> 08:42.130
There she is.

08:44.306 --> 08:47.004
I thought I'd surprise you
with your favorite.

08:51.269 --> 08:52.270
That hurt.

08:54.446 --> 08:56.927
How many times
do I have to tell you
to not drag your feet?

08:58.059 --> 08:59.539
You and our...

08:59.582 --> 09:02.019
...tricity-like
capacitors.

09:04.544 --> 09:05.414
Jennifer.

09:07.024 --> 09:08.548
Jennifer, are you okay?

09:10.637 --> 09:11.551
Mmm-mmm.

09:12.334 --> 09:13.422
No, I feel funny.

09:14.597 --> 09:16.207
Nothing is really normal.

09:17.818 --> 09:18.906
Well, that's good because...

09:18.949 --> 09:20.298
We're not normal?

09:20.342 --> 09:21.865
Yes, but, no...

09:21.909 --> 09:24.041
Well... Look,
what I was gonna say is

09:25.260 --> 09:28.872
it should never feel normal
living through an occupation.

09:28.916 --> 09:32.441
The moment it does,
you will find yourself
on the wrong side of history.

09:33.616 --> 09:35.052
The ASA--

09:35.096 --> 09:36.619
Is protecting us
from the Markovians,
yeah, I know.

09:36.663 --> 09:39.491
Maybe the ASA
is protecting us.

09:39.535 --> 09:42.146
There is a fine line
between
protecting

09:42.190 --> 09:44.279
and repressing.

09:44.322 --> 09:46.629
You know, history is
full of examples of

09:46.673 --> 09:48.457
liberators
who become oppressors.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.241
Dad. Look,

09:50.285 --> 09:52.635
I love you,
but it's way too early for
a history lesson, okay?

09:53.462 --> 09:55.072
And I don't feel good,

09:55.116 --> 09:56.944
so I'm just gonna
take a sick day.

09:58.032 --> 09:59.207
Wait, hold on.

09:59.686 --> 10:00.991
I...

10:06.606 --> 10:07.650
Hmm...

10:07.694 --> 10:08.956
You're going to school.

10:19.183 --> 10:21.621
You have an update,
Dr. Stewart?

10:21.664 --> 10:24.145
I believe I know how to
stabilize the meta-gene.

10:25.668 --> 10:27.670
I thought I was lucid dreaming.

10:27.714 --> 10:31.413
Turns out my subconscious self
is quite demanding
when it wants to be heard.

10:32.153 --> 10:33.545
Dreams of severed feet.

10:35.373 --> 10:38.376
Dr. Jace deliberately infected
the metas of Freeland

10:38.420 --> 10:41.466
to send me her research
sliced into the DNA
of the virus.

10:41.510 --> 10:43.947
From which she was successful
in developing a vaccine.

10:43.991 --> 10:48.299
Yes! On closer examination
of the virus' RNA,
it was revealed that

10:48.343 --> 10:50.127
Dr. Jace used
a gene-editing tool

10:50.171 --> 10:52.434
to send me
a specific amino acid chain.

10:52.477 --> 10:55.829
What do amino acids
have to do with our
meta-stabilization problem?

10:55.872 --> 10:57.265
Everything!

10:57.308 --> 11:00.529
Twenty amino acids like this
make up a protein chain.

11:00.572 --> 11:03.706
This particular protein
was a byproduct
of a serum

11:03.750 --> 11:07.144
that was the predecessor
to the metagenic vaccine
in Green Light.

11:07.188 --> 11:09.320
Once it's metabolized
in a human host,

11:09.364 --> 11:10.887
it strengthens
the mitochondrial membrane

11:10.931 --> 11:13.020
potential of meta cells
significantly.

11:13.498 --> 11:14.935
Don't you see?

11:14.978 --> 11:17.764
Dr. Jace sent me the protein
I needed to theoretically

11:17.807 --> 11:19.635
stabilize the meta-gene
permanently.

11:20.244 --> 11:21.768
The only problem is,

11:21.811 --> 11:23.030
it can't be synthesized
in the lab,

11:23.073 --> 11:25.902
it has to be extracted
from a human host.

11:25.946 --> 11:27.687
Any human host will suffice?

11:28.775 --> 11:30.211
Well, that where
it gets strange.

11:30.864 --> 11:32.169
According to the ASA database,

11:32.213 --> 11:34.302
only one patient survived
taking the serum.

11:35.651 --> 11:36.696
Patient 49.

11:40.221 --> 11:42.049
New information
has come to light

11:42.092 --> 11:44.094
and the vigilante
known as Blackbird

11:44.138 --> 11:47.402
is now wanted in connection
with the recent assault
on police headquarters

11:47.445 --> 11:50.144
as well as the abduction
of several prisoners,

11:50.187 --> 11:52.233
including that of a minor.

11:52.276 --> 11:55.497
As Freeland's
acting Chief of Police,

11:55.540 --> 11:57.978
I implore anyone
with information on this matter

11:58.021 --> 12:00.067
to contact
local law enforcement,

12:00.110 --> 12:02.634
and a $50,000 reward
is now being offered

12:02.678 --> 12:05.855
for any information
leading to the arrest
of this individual.

12:05.899 --> 12:10.425
Remember, folks,
if you see something,
say something.

12:14.037 --> 12:15.299
All right, all right.

12:17.606 --> 12:20.261
Oh, I saw that.
What do you want me
to say about it?

12:20.304 --> 12:21.566
No, no, no, no.
That's all right,
it's all right.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.394
- Fifty K.

12:23.438 --> 12:26.136
More like
30 silver pieces to me.

12:26.180 --> 12:28.399
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself, son.

12:28.443 --> 12:31.533
-It's all right,
it's all right.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.451
The ASA murdered our boy.

12:37.234 --> 12:38.670
And now they're
covering it up.

12:39.454 --> 12:41.325
They expect us to believe this

12:41.369 --> 12:45.503
Blackbird broke our baby
out of a fully armed
police station?

12:46.374 --> 12:47.723
Mr. and Mrs. Singley,

12:47.767 --> 12:50.421
Tavon is
a very special student
here at Garfield.

12:50.465 --> 12:53.598
But the ASA didn't murder him.

12:55.252 --> 12:57.820
Then... then where is my son?

12:58.647 --> 12:59.909
Where is he?

12:59.953 --> 13:01.824
Tavon was identified as a meta.

13:02.651 --> 13:04.435
Our son was no meta.

13:04.479 --> 13:07.438
We took their test
and registered a month ago.

13:07.482 --> 13:09.614
Look! Here's the paperwork
to prove it.

13:13.662 --> 13:16.926
Tavon tested negative
for the meta-gene.

13:16.970 --> 13:20.016
A students swatted
on my boy,

13:20.060 --> 13:21.583
and now he's gone.

13:21.626 --> 13:23.803
The ASA knew
our son wasn't a meta.

13:24.891 --> 13:25.805
They didn't care.

13:27.284 --> 13:29.634
The law doesn't matter
anymore in Freeland.

13:29.678 --> 13:31.941
It's the metas
who brought this misery

13:31.985 --> 13:33.377
to Freeland in the first place.

13:33.421 --> 13:36.990
If it wasn't for them,
Tavon would be in school.

13:37.033 --> 13:40.471
Look, all we want
is our boy back.

13:40.515 --> 13:43.997
If you could find out
something, anything...

13:44.040 --> 13:47.609
-Please, Mr. Pierce, we're...
we're going out of our minds.
-Please...

13:52.179 --> 13:53.702
Okay, you have my word.

13:57.488 --> 13:59.534
All right, so the vaccine
will make you immune

13:59.577 --> 14:01.884
to the virus that
has been hitting metas.

14:01.928 --> 14:03.755
You sure this is necessary?

14:03.799 --> 14:04.974
Anti-vaxxer much?

14:05.018 --> 14:06.715
I meant the babysitter
you called for me.

14:06.758 --> 14:09.674
I survived this occupation
for a month without you.

14:09.718 --> 14:11.894
And neither of us know
how your shape-shifting cells

14:11.938 --> 14:13.635
will respond to this vaccine.

14:13.678 --> 14:16.551
And since my father
has already proven
a trigger for you,

14:16.594 --> 14:18.335
I need someone else here
I can trust

14:18.379 --> 14:20.337
to look after you
while I'm out.

14:20.381 --> 14:21.904
And Gambi's no stranger.

14:21.948 --> 14:25.212
You didn't watch the video
Shonda cued up for you?

14:25.255 --> 14:27.388
Which films
would you like to view?

14:28.476 --> 14:29.912
Ask her anything
and she'll do it.

14:29.956 --> 14:31.914
I don't feel comfortable
with that.

14:31.958 --> 14:34.047
Doesn't it feels like slavery?

14:34.090 --> 14:36.005
-Do not emancipate...

14:36.049 --> 14:38.181
...my, my smart home.

14:38.225 --> 14:39.748
Shonda is a robot.

14:39.791 --> 14:42.403
Yeah, and robot comes
from the Czech word robota.

14:42.446 --> 14:44.927
It means "forced labor." So...

14:46.233 --> 14:47.364
You have a visitor,

14:47.408 --> 14:49.018
Anissa, fairest of them all.

14:49.062 --> 14:50.541
Shall I permit entry?

14:53.022 --> 14:55.198
Yes, Shonda. Thank you.

14:55.242 --> 14:56.939
It is my pleasure
to serve you.

15:01.030 --> 15:02.902
- Hey.

15:04.077 --> 15:05.252
Hey.

15:06.296 --> 15:09.038
I should have checked
for food allergies.

15:09.082 --> 15:10.735
I'm sorry, I just...

15:10.779 --> 15:14.348
All right, well, I hope that
there is no objection to...

15:16.045 --> 15:17.351
fettuccine alfredo.

15:18.091 --> 15:20.789
Grace, meet my Uncle Gambi.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.575
I thought you'd be black.

15:24.619 --> 15:26.490
I thought you'd have
leopard spots.

15:26.534 --> 15:28.057
Looks like we have
a lot to talk about.

15:30.625 --> 15:32.975
All right, look.
I'll be out late.
Don't wait up.

15:33.019 --> 15:36.239
We'll be fine.
If anything goes wrong,
I'm here.

15:36.283 --> 15:38.589
And, Anissa, remember.
Be careful out there.

15:38.633 --> 15:40.287
Blackbird has a price
on her head.

15:41.375 --> 15:44.291
Stay... I've got a bad feeling.

15:44.813 --> 15:48.643
Hey, I am meta-fabulous.

15:49.339 --> 15:50.688
I'll be fine.

15:52.038 --> 15:52.952
Okay?

15:53.865 --> 15:54.779
Come here.

15:58.479 --> 16:00.698
All right. You two have fun.

16:00.742 --> 16:01.656
We'll be fine.

16:04.702 --> 16:06.356
Say...

16:06.400 --> 16:08.402
do you want to see some of
Anissa's baby pictures?

16:09.055 --> 16:10.404
Yeah.

16:10.447 --> 16:13.798
So today, we'll be learning
the basics of coding.

16:13.842 --> 16:15.670
-All those apps
you love to use...

16:17.411 --> 16:19.021
...now you can
create them yourselves.

16:20.501 --> 16:21.632
Hey, Brandon.

16:23.112 --> 16:24.026
Brandon.

16:25.071 --> 16:26.986
Yes, Your Highness?

16:27.029 --> 16:28.639
Look, not today, pretty boy.

16:28.683 --> 16:30.641
Prove chivalry isn't dead
and give me your jacket,
all right?

16:30.685 --> 16:31.773
I'm freezing.

16:33.557 --> 16:34.428
Here.

16:36.082 --> 16:37.431
Hey, you're welcome.

16:48.572 --> 16:50.052
All right, everyone,
just remain calm.

16:51.227 --> 16:53.142
It's probably just
a power surge.

16:53.186 --> 16:54.361
I'll be right back.

17:00.062 --> 17:01.368
You okay, Jen?

17:03.109 --> 17:05.676
Oh, yeah. Just a bad comedown.

17:05.720 --> 17:07.722
I was flying high
on pure energy last night,

17:07.765 --> 17:09.941
and now I feel like
gravity's crushing me,
you know.

17:10.725 --> 17:12.422
It must have been
some party.

17:14.076 --> 17:15.860
Best way to beat a hangover?

17:16.731 --> 17:17.949
Electrolytes.

17:18.776 --> 17:20.996
Thank you.
I'll hit you back, okay?

17:39.623 --> 17:41.930
Patient 49, as requested.

17:57.293 --> 17:59.382
Oh, you look lost, Chief.
-We need to talk.

17:59.426 --> 18:01.123
Ah, afternoon rush
about to hit, but, um...

18:01.167 --> 18:03.082
- Here you go.
-This should
hold you out until then.

18:03.821 --> 18:05.693
Mmm.

18:05.736 --> 18:07.477
All right, everybody,
listen up.

18:07.521 --> 18:10.654
In 60 seconds,
the ASA rolls in here.

18:10.698 --> 18:14.136
-They will be verifying
your registration cards.

18:14.180 --> 18:16.225
If you do not possess one,

18:16.269 --> 18:18.097
you will be
taking a ride downtown.

18:19.141 --> 18:20.447
Hey, hey.

18:21.143 --> 18:22.101
Hey...

18:24.364 --> 18:25.669
Have a nice day.

18:27.628 --> 18:29.804
Bro, was all that necessary?

18:29.847 --> 18:31.675
They ain't never
coming back now.

18:36.071 --> 18:39.770
You stealing supplies
from the ASA and selling
them at markup?

18:39.814 --> 18:42.599
Occupation's been
good to you, huh, Two-Bits?

18:43.644 --> 18:45.036
Make you feel like a big man

18:45.080 --> 18:46.951
profiting while everybody else
around you suffers?

18:46.995 --> 18:49.258
Better than goose-stepping
with the ASA.

18:49.302 --> 18:50.346
Is that
what you think I'm doing?

18:50.390 --> 18:51.565
I didn't say nothing, man.

18:51.608 --> 18:52.957
Why are you
hounding me anyway?

18:55.308 --> 18:56.613
Hey, I did miss.

18:57.266 --> 18:58.398
You're under arrest

18:58.441 --> 19:00.791
for assaulting a police officer

19:00.835 --> 19:03.142
and for the possession
of stolen goods.

19:04.012 --> 19:06.797
You have the right
to remain silent.

19:06.841 --> 19:10.627
Anything you say can
and will be held against you
in a court of law.

19:13.326 --> 19:14.936
Goose-step that.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.199
Listen to me.

19:17.243 --> 19:19.462
Inoculate everyone here

19:19.506 --> 19:21.943
before we take them
outside the perimeter.

19:24.250 --> 19:27.166
I'll deliver the rest
of the vaccine
to the Perdi tonight.

19:28.863 --> 19:31.692
The good Lord works
in mysterious ways.

19:31.735 --> 19:33.824
Now, if I'm being honest,

19:33.868 --> 19:36.000
I can't handle
much more mystery.

19:36.044 --> 19:39.656
But we're very thankful
for the guardian angel
he did send.

19:39.700 --> 19:42.659
Get them prepped
and ready to go.

19:42.703 --> 19:45.706
Make sure they're all
wearing black.

19:51.494 --> 19:54.018
I hope this isn't a bad time. You have a secure call waiting.

19:54.628 --> 19:56.282
Put it through.

19:56.325 --> 19:57.283
Hey, Gambi, what's up?

19:57.326 --> 19:58.545
No, it's me.

19:58.588 --> 20:00.764
Dad? Wait.
Is everything okay?

20:00.808 --> 20:02.636
Mixed bag.
I need to talk to you.

20:02.679 --> 20:04.812
Look, the train's
about to leave.

20:04.855 --> 20:07.554
Yeah, I know.
Look, I need you to bring
Tavon back to Freeland.

20:07.597 --> 20:09.425
What the hell? No!

20:09.469 --> 20:11.775
Look, his parents
are worried sick,

20:11.819 --> 20:13.821
all right?
They think he's dead.

20:13.864 --> 20:15.562
He will be, if I do that.

20:16.606 --> 20:20.349
The ASA is hunting
metas down. And Tavon--

20:20.393 --> 20:22.133
Tavon was misidentified.

20:22.177 --> 20:23.700
He is not a meta.

20:23.744 --> 20:26.225
All right? Now, he needs
to be with his family.

20:26.268 --> 20:29.140
Besides, they're looking
for you taking people out,

20:29.184 --> 20:30.881
not bringing them back in.

20:30.925 --> 20:32.100
Too dangerous.

20:32.840 --> 20:36.060
There is a price on my head.

20:36.104 --> 20:39.977
And getting past ASA
is not as easy as
I make it look.

20:41.109 --> 20:44.678
What if Grace
was taken by the ASA?

20:44.721 --> 20:47.768
Wouldn't you do everything
in your power to get her back?

20:49.422 --> 20:50.858
I'll see what I can do.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.600
But for the record...

20:56.167 --> 20:57.256
this is a bad idea.

21:12.358 --> 21:13.663
More mouths to feed?

21:14.577 --> 21:17.493
You live on a farm. Here.

21:17.537 --> 21:18.973
We don't need
any more of your money.

21:22.106 --> 21:24.631
An epidemic has swept
through Freeland.

21:25.719 --> 21:26.981
The virus...

21:28.983 --> 21:30.985
targets metas, specifically.

21:33.379 --> 21:34.423
You heard of Ebola?

21:36.817 --> 21:39.210
This is more lethal
and contagious.

21:39.254 --> 21:40.734
We're isolated, we're safe.

21:40.777 --> 21:43.737
You've already been exposed.

21:43.780 --> 21:47.175
There is enough vaccine
to inoculate every meta here.

21:51.397 --> 21:52.659
Here.

21:54.443 --> 21:57.098
Excuse me while I go
save my people
from the plague you brought.

22:03.104 --> 22:06.803
Look, nice, really nice
most of the time.

22:07.587 --> 22:08.805
She's just a little scared.

22:10.764 --> 22:12.069
Yeah, me too.

22:13.636 --> 22:15.203
How you holding up, Tavon?

22:15.638 --> 22:17.336
I miss my parents.

22:17.379 --> 22:20.339
Look, I made a couple of videos
for them on my phone.

22:20.382 --> 22:22.036
You think you could take it
to 'em for me?

22:23.472 --> 22:25.822
You want to take it
to 'em yourself?

22:25.866 --> 22:28.956
Really? What, you gonna
take me home?

22:28.999 --> 22:31.828
Your parents have proof
that you're not a meta.

22:32.742 --> 22:34.091
Now, it's going
to be dangerous,

22:34.135 --> 22:35.876
but if you're willing
to take the risk...

22:39.053 --> 22:40.620
I trust you're aware
that Blackbird

22:40.663 --> 22:42.230
has been sighted
leaving the perimeter?

22:44.232 --> 22:45.929
I cross-referenced
her prior breaches

22:45.973 --> 22:48.279
against Freeland's power grid.

22:48.323 --> 22:50.847
She's following
the grid's fluctuations,

22:50.891 --> 22:53.284
slipping through
the weak windows
as they pass.

22:53.328 --> 22:55.852
Can you predict her next
window of re-entry?

22:55.896 --> 22:57.376
I'm sitting on it now.

22:58.551 --> 22:59.856
Happy hunting.

23:05.558 --> 23:07.908
I'm a fan of your work,
Mrs. Pierce.

23:09.779 --> 23:11.477
It's Dr. Stewart.

23:11.520 --> 23:15.350
Aw, it's gonna be that way.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.134
I figured given our history...

23:19.441 --> 23:21.225
Fair enough.

23:21.269 --> 23:25.229
Like I said, I love
watching you work.

23:25.273 --> 23:28.494
Tell me, how many of
those pod kids did you kill?

23:28.537 --> 23:30.365
Ten or twelve?

23:32.715 --> 23:34.413
Fourteen children
died in my care.

23:36.371 --> 23:37.938
Broke me up inside watching.

23:38.504 --> 23:39.766
I was rooting for you.

23:40.331 --> 23:41.420
You do understand...

23:42.464 --> 23:44.597
I have a thing
for the underdog.

23:44.640 --> 23:49.079
And the way you handled
yourself with Dr. Jace... Whoo.

23:49.123 --> 23:53.562
"Float like a butterfly,
sting like a queen bee."

23:53.606 --> 23:58.785
You've got fire, that's for
damn sure Mrs... Dr. Stewart.

24:00.482 --> 24:02.353
Woman after my own heart.

24:04.834 --> 24:06.445
I'm nothing like you!

24:07.707 --> 24:09.796
That syringe tells
a different story.

24:10.492 --> 24:11.928
This is MB4.

24:13.713 --> 24:14.931
That's right.

24:16.803 --> 24:20.850
This is the MB4 serum
that made you the monster
that you are.

24:21.851 --> 24:23.331
Augmented strength,

24:24.201 --> 24:25.681
eternal youth,

24:25.725 --> 24:27.378
all here in this syringe

24:27.422 --> 24:29.468
that I'm about to plunge
into your body.

24:31.905 --> 24:33.472
And why give it to me, then?

24:34.864 --> 24:37.563
Because now, you work for me,
you miserable bastard.

24:37.606 --> 24:38.477
Hmm.

24:44.874 --> 24:46.223
Like I said,

24:47.877 --> 24:49.488
fire, Dr. Stewart.

24:51.664 --> 24:52.578
Fire!

25:10.639 --> 25:11.988
Grace, how're you feeling?

25:16.558 --> 25:18.299
Everything seems normal...

25:19.430 --> 25:21.520
for me.

25:21.563 --> 25:23.783
Blackbird has been spotted
at the perimeter.

25:23.826 --> 25:25.132
Orders are to not engage.

25:25.175 --> 25:27.177
I repeat, do not engage.

25:30.093 --> 25:32.052
- What does that mean?

25:32.400 --> 25:33.314
Trouble.

25:40.582 --> 25:41.583
Come on, Tavon.

25:42.410 --> 25:43.411
Stay with me.

25:46.632 --> 25:47.894
Come on, quick.

25:59.645 --> 26:00.646
What? You new?

26:02.386 --> 26:05.041
ASA? Markovian?

26:06.260 --> 26:07.087
Run!

26:38.031 --> 26:39.423
Help! It hurts!

26:39.467 --> 26:42.339
Don't talk. Don't talk,
okay? Shallow breaths.

26:42.383 --> 26:45.038
Okay, I'm gonna
get you home.
I promise.

26:45.952 --> 26:47.518
Somebody! Come in!

26:48.650 --> 26:49.956
Blackbird, where are you?

26:51.305 --> 26:54.221
Meet me in the tunnel.
I'm coming in hot.

27:00.575 --> 27:02.142
Dad, hurry! It's bad.

27:16.243 --> 27:17.157
Hi!

27:18.985 --> 27:22.423
Thank you for seeing me
at this, uh, late hour,
Ms. Pierce.

27:24.730 --> 27:26.601
I found myself in the...

27:26.645 --> 27:29.952
area so to... speak.

27:29.996 --> 27:31.693
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything?

27:33.652 --> 27:37.264
I, uh, just catching up
on some reading.

27:38.613 --> 27:40.354
Tea?

27:40.397 --> 27:44.314
I must confess that
I'm very relieved to
find you safe at home.

27:44.358 --> 27:46.882
Where else would I be
after curfew?

27:46.926 --> 27:49.015
Where else, indeed.

27:49.058 --> 27:51.452
Do you know
the vigilante, Blackbird?

27:51.495 --> 27:54.847
Not, not personally.
I've seen the graffiti.

27:54.890 --> 27:56.675
Uh... nice suit.

27:58.589 --> 27:59.590
Why?

27:59.634 --> 28:02.115
I follow data, Ms. Pierce.

28:03.159 --> 28:06.380
And, uh, data...

28:07.598 --> 28:09.296
rarely lies.

28:10.558 --> 28:13.082
The individual I seek

28:13.735 --> 28:16.695
shares your height, weight,

28:18.609 --> 28:20.307
and other metrics.

28:29.620 --> 28:34.103
Yet you simply can't be
in two places at once.

28:36.497 --> 28:37.890
What do you mean?

28:37.933 --> 28:39.718
What do you mean?

28:41.154 --> 28:44.026
Blackbird breached
the perimeter,

28:44.070 --> 28:46.420
the ASA is engaging
as we speak,

28:46.463 --> 28:50.076
and her reign of terror
has come to an end.

28:57.039 --> 28:58.562
Apologies

28:58.606 --> 29:01.652
for entertaining such
a ludicrous notion.

29:01.696 --> 29:05.482
Let you go back to reading,
and good night.

29:20.846 --> 29:21.760
Grace.

29:22.499 --> 29:23.283
I'm fine.

29:23.326 --> 29:25.851
Go. Anissa needs help.

29:34.642 --> 29:38.907
Lord make me wait
out of no pain.
Gonna get me some dinner,

29:38.951 --> 29:40.517
get on out of here, and pray.

29:45.653 --> 29:48.612
Reverend Holt. It's good
to see you on the mend.

29:48.656 --> 29:51.267
There before the grace of God
goes I.

29:51.311 --> 29:53.139
-Hmm.

29:53.182 --> 29:56.098
What're you doing down here
at this time of night,
Chief Henderson?

29:56.142 --> 29:58.187
Oh, you know, following leads.

29:58.231 --> 29:59.841
Tracking down the Blackbird.

29:59.885 --> 30:03.236
You haven't seen anything
out of sorts lately, have you?

30:03.279 --> 30:05.281
If I saw something,
I'd have said something.

30:05.325 --> 30:06.979
-Mmm-hmm.

30:07.022 --> 30:11.679
The trouble is, all my leads
end right here
in this church.

30:13.289 --> 30:14.682
You care to explain?

30:15.291 --> 30:17.903
I have no earthly idea.

30:17.946 --> 30:20.166
I suppose
those with the most sin

30:21.210 --> 30:22.559
cast the first stone.

30:25.519 --> 30:28.652
Well, I'm not the one
smuggling the metas
outside of Freeland.

30:31.220 --> 30:34.615
All aboard! Choo-choo!

30:35.746 --> 30:37.618
Yeah, I thought
that might ring a bell.

30:40.186 --> 30:42.144
Now, now, come on, Chief.
Listen...

30:42.188 --> 30:44.538
You don't think
I'm human trafficking?

30:45.756 --> 30:48.585
Huh? I am down here...

30:49.369 --> 30:51.197
saving these poor souls.

30:52.198 --> 30:53.634
These people have rights.

30:53.677 --> 30:55.201
Chief Henderson,
they have rights!

30:55.244 --> 30:58.552
Reverend Holt,
you have the right
to remain silent.

30:58.595 --> 31:01.816
A right that I know
that you will waive.

31:01.860 --> 31:05.037
Now, you hear me,
Chief Henderson. You cannot
arrest me here.

31:05.080 --> 31:06.908
We are in the house
of the Lord.

31:06.952 --> 31:08.344
And He sees all.

31:08.388 --> 31:10.738
Yeah. Between me and you,
Reverend, He's seen worse.

31:11.957 --> 31:13.697
Come on.

31:13.741 --> 31:17.266
I owe you a debt of gratitude,
Dr. Stewart.
You made me young again.

31:18.746 --> 31:20.574
Pay me in silence.

31:20.617 --> 31:22.402
Your bedside manner needs work.

31:23.359 --> 31:26.232
Tell me, what's on
the ASA agenda today?

31:26.754 --> 31:28.060
Waterboarding,

31:28.103 --> 31:29.931
thumbscrews,

31:29.975 --> 31:31.628
conjugal visit, perhaps?

31:33.761 --> 31:36.982
I'm gonna extract a sample
of your bone marrow.

31:37.025 --> 31:39.288
Hmm, sounds excruciating.

31:40.899 --> 31:44.598
When a local anesthetic
is administered,
it's quite painless.

31:44.641 --> 31:46.252
After I make a small incision,

31:46.295 --> 31:48.994
I'll insert this needle
into your pelvic bone

31:49.037 --> 31:50.386
and extract the bone marrow.

31:50.865 --> 31:51.910
Why me?

31:54.608 --> 31:56.827
When your body processes
the MB4 serum,

31:56.871 --> 31:59.091
it creates a byproduct protein
I believe I could use

31:59.134 --> 32:00.701
to stabilize the metas
of Freeland.

32:00.744 --> 32:04.009
I recently found myself
with a lot of time
to contemplate

32:04.052 --> 32:06.489
what got me in
this godforsaken pit.

32:06.533 --> 32:09.405
And all I can come up with
is Black Lightning
always showing up

32:09.449 --> 32:11.364
whenever your daughters
are in trouble.

32:13.105 --> 32:14.323
Once is chance.

32:14.367 --> 32:16.630
Second time is coincidence,
but a third?

32:17.370 --> 32:18.806
Now, that's a pattern.

32:20.373 --> 32:22.723
Black Lightning saves
a lot of lives in Freeland.

32:22.766 --> 32:24.551
This is true.

32:24.594 --> 32:26.988
But after that boy
your daughter was dating
got his spine ripped out,

32:27.032 --> 32:30.252
some new female
firecracker-type
superhero appeared

32:30.296 --> 32:31.993
and lit my ass up,

32:33.255 --> 32:35.866
with Black Lightning's help,
of course.

32:35.910 --> 32:36.955
Do you see the pattern?

32:38.086 --> 32:39.827
Only the musings of a lunatic.

32:40.741 --> 32:41.829
Humor me.

32:41.872 --> 32:44.310
Answer this lunatic's
one question.

32:45.354 --> 32:47.661
What's your super suit
look like, Dr. Stewart?

32:49.271 --> 32:50.664
And to think

32:50.707 --> 32:53.623
I lie here before
superhero royalty.

32:55.364 --> 32:58.063
It all makes sense to me now.

32:58.106 --> 33:01.066
One merry melanated meta-family

33:01.109 --> 33:03.416
solving crimes
and protecting Freeland.

33:04.243 --> 33:05.418
You're delusional.

33:07.028 --> 33:09.639
No, I'm not delusional.

33:11.337 --> 33:13.165
I'll make you this promise.

33:13.208 --> 33:16.951
After I kill Black Lightning
and that lying bastard
Jefferson Pierce,

33:17.821 --> 33:19.171
you and your
beautiful daughters

33:19.214 --> 33:20.999
will have
nothing to fear from me.

33:21.869 --> 33:23.436
I always pay my debts.

33:31.748 --> 33:34.012
Did I neglect to administer
the anesthetic?

33:35.100 --> 33:36.710
Ahhh!

33:53.901 --> 33:54.902
There!

34:00.560 --> 34:01.909
What happened?

34:02.953 --> 34:05.391
We got ambushed.

34:05.434 --> 34:07.915
They hit us with
some kind of poison.

34:08.742 --> 34:11.788
I told you this was a bad idea.

34:12.572 --> 34:13.703
Look what you've done.

34:13.747 --> 34:15.923
Tavon. Tavon,
can you hear me?

34:18.621 --> 34:20.449
Black Lightning.

34:24.671 --> 34:26.629
No. No, no, no, Tavon.

34:27.804 --> 34:29.110
Tavon!

34:29.154 --> 34:31.721
No! Come on,
Tavon, come on.

34:31.765 --> 34:32.809
Tavon.

34:34.115 --> 34:36.335
Tavon. Tavon!

34:47.650 --> 34:49.304
I'm so sorry for your loss.

34:49.348 --> 34:53.047
Those
ASA sons of bitches
murdered our boy!

34:57.051 --> 34:59.923
Wake up!

35:04.058 --> 35:08.236
I don't know whether
to throw Dr. Jace
a party or a funeral.

35:08.280 --> 35:11.761
I trust you've finally solved
the riddle of
meta stabilization?

35:11.805 --> 35:14.112
I'm preparing
the formula now.

35:14.155 --> 35:15.939
Testing won't be far behind.

35:15.983 --> 35:19.073
There were no issues
with patient 49, I trust?

35:20.988 --> 35:22.120
You could've warned me!

35:23.077 --> 35:25.645
Tobias Whale murdered
Jefferson's father.

35:25.688 --> 35:27.603
What happens to him
when all this is
said and done?

35:27.647 --> 35:29.170
I wouldn't concern
yourself with that.

35:29.214 --> 35:31.259
He knows my family's secrets.

35:31.303 --> 35:34.175
Jefferson's, Anissa's,
even Jennifer's
were vulnerable.

35:34.219 --> 35:35.263
Highly improbable.

35:35.307 --> 35:37.004
He threatened
to murder Jefferson

35:37.047 --> 35:38.440
and leave our girls alone,

35:38.484 --> 35:40.268
his twisted idea of a favor

35:40.312 --> 35:42.488
in exchange for giving him
the MB4 serum.

35:43.663 --> 35:47.667
What exactly are you
asking me to do, Dr. Stewart?

35:47.710 --> 35:50.235
What is the point
of all this cloak and dagger

35:50.278 --> 35:52.106
if you cannot
protect my family?

35:54.021 --> 35:57.720
When I am done with Tobias,
you make him disappear,
permanently.

36:01.637 --> 36:04.031
Keep me... apprised.

36:14.998 --> 36:16.957
Tavon's dead. How?

36:17.000 --> 36:19.655
The ASA shot him trying
to escape the perimeter.

36:20.439 --> 36:22.789
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

36:26.532 --> 36:29.665
There they are. The ASA.

36:29.709 --> 36:31.493
Hey, why you punks
murder Tavon?

36:31.537 --> 36:33.669
Stand down. Return to class.

36:33.713 --> 36:35.280
There won't be
another warning.

36:35.323 --> 36:37.673
Oh, yeah?
Like you warned Tavon?

36:37.717 --> 36:39.675
Before you ASA asshats
killed him?

36:41.068 --> 36:43.810
You know what?
We are not afraid of you.

36:43.853 --> 36:46.682
- No.
-This is Freeland.

36:46.726 --> 36:48.858
You know, it's time the ASA
got the hell out anyway.

36:48.902 --> 36:50.686
- Yes.
-For Tavon!

36:50.730 --> 36:54.212
Tavon! Tavon! Tavon! Tavon!

36:54.255 --> 36:56.692
Tavon! Tavon!

36:56.736 --> 36:58.085
Remember his face!

36:59.521 --> 37:00.740
Murderers!

37:02.916 --> 37:06.093
Everybody disperse at once!

37:06.136 --> 37:08.226
Demonstration over!

37:08.269 --> 37:10.140
What the hell is going on?

37:10.184 --> 37:12.273
These are kids.
They're on school property.

37:15.407 --> 37:17.104
Hey, Jen.

37:17.147 --> 37:19.367
Chill out, Brandon.
You'll get your jacket back
soon enough.

37:19.411 --> 37:20.977
It's not that.

37:21.021 --> 37:22.022
I wanted to ask...

37:24.111 --> 37:26.113
-What's going on down there?
-I don't know.

37:28.115 --> 37:30.378
Stand down!
I will have you arrested.

37:30.422 --> 37:31.771
Tavon is dead.

37:31.814 --> 37:34.426
Now I will not have
another kid die on my watch.

37:57.797 --> 37:58.754
Dad!

38:02.628 --> 38:04.630
Everybody, stay back!

38:08.416 --> 38:12.159
I told you, stay... down!

38:18.339 --> 38:20.515
Brandon, get off of me.
I have to help him.

38:20.559 --> 38:21.995
No, stop.
It will be a massacre.

38:34.312 --> 38:35.661
How did you do that?

39:17.790 --> 39:19.269
So beating my dad down
like a dog

39:19.313 --> 39:21.184
is a part of saving Freeland
from Markovia, huh?

39:21.228 --> 39:23.665
I marched alongside
Martin Luther King, Jr.,

39:23.709 --> 39:25.406
in the civil rights movement.

39:25.450 --> 39:29.584
I never enjoy watching
a black man being
beaten on the street.

39:29.628 --> 39:31.760
Your men, your responsibility.

39:31.804 --> 39:35.068
Those men responsible
did so of their own accord.

39:35.111 --> 39:37.331
I am going to reprimand them.

39:39.768 --> 39:42.728
Perhaps you'd care
to take a ride with me?

39:45.905 --> 39:47.689
All right,
I'll raise you ten.

39:47.733 --> 39:48.908
Let's see your hand.

39:57.046 --> 39:58.439
Who the hell
are you supposed to be?

40:12.105 --> 40:15.064
Did you have to leave us here
the whole night? Damn!

40:18.677 --> 40:21.375
I demand to know the meaning
behind this, Chief Henderson.

40:22.202 --> 40:23.246
I want to know!

40:24.813 --> 40:26.206
Careful, Reverend.

40:45.051 --> 40:48.054
-Get on the ground!

40:50.709 --> 40:52.841
Tavon Singley
and Jefferson Pierce

40:52.885 --> 40:54.190
are the spark we needed.

40:54.626 --> 40:55.714
"We"?

40:55.757 --> 40:57.237
What exactly are you saying?

40:57.280 --> 41:00.240
The people of Freeland
are ready to fight now.

41:00.283 --> 41:02.590
We've all been working
independently,

41:02.634 --> 41:04.940
nickel-and-diming
these bastards,

41:04.984 --> 41:07.334
but it's time to join forces,

41:07.377 --> 41:08.857
run the ASA out of here,

41:08.901 --> 41:10.555
take our freedom back.

41:10.598 --> 41:14.254
So, you've been leading
the insurgents this whole time?

41:14.297 --> 41:16.386
I'm just a man
trying to do what's right.

41:18.519 --> 41:20.129
Join us.

41:20.173 --> 41:23.089
We'll be crucified
if we try to take the ASA
on by ourselves.

41:24.525 --> 41:26.179
But who said
we by ourselves?

41:37.059 --> 41:38.844
And the scales
fell from his eyes,

41:38.887 --> 41:40.280
turning Saul to Paul.

41:49.332 --> 41:50.290
My man.
