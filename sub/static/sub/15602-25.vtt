00:21.770 --> 00:23.879
<i>~ Previously
on "Green Lantern"... ~</i>

00:31.199 --> 00:33.139
You tried to kill me.

00:33.170 --> 00:35.903
That was never the plan.
We only hoped to...

00:38.668 --> 00:41.730
Season 1, Episode 25:
<b>"Ranx"</b>

00:42.562 --> 00:45.562
Sync & corrections: Reef
www.addic7ed.com

00:47.526 --> 00:49.919
Hello? Come in!

00:50.044 --> 00:52.812
Hold on. I'm still getting
that weird signal.

00:52.861 --> 00:55.864
But every time
I try and respond, static.

00:55.931 --> 00:58.386
- You?
- I got nothin'.

00:58.410 --> 01:00.942
And without the Interceptor,
we can't boost the signal.

01:00.966 --> 01:03.750
Oh, that's right.
Hal had to sacrifice the ship

01:03.773 --> 01:05.810
to stop your girlfriend
from killing us.

01:05.845 --> 01:07.937
You can be so tiring.

01:07.970 --> 01:09.933
I'll repeat myself
for the last time.

01:09.955 --> 01:13.058
That thing that caused all of this
is not our Aya.

01:13.131 --> 01:16.121
Well, I hope you're right.
I really do.

01:16.160 --> 01:19.796
But look around before you get
too comfortable in that fantasy.

01:20.005 --> 01:22.223
Face it, kid.

01:22.253 --> 01:24.454
We gotta shut her down.

01:35.217 --> 01:36.718
What are you doing?

01:36.754 --> 01:42.144
It's a calming technique I was taught
on Odym to purge rage from my mind.

01:42.648 --> 01:45.117
Does that stuff really work?

01:45.149 --> 01:48.885
I would not be able to control
my own anger without it.

01:49.071 --> 01:53.637
- Consider yourself lucky.
- I think I'm getting something.

01:53.676 --> 01:56.171
<i>[static] Green Lanterns, come in.
Answer immediately.</i>

01:56.212 --> 01:59.042
<i>- Green Lanterns, respond.</i>
- I'm here. We're here.

01:59.072 --> 02:00.773
Sorry it took so long
to answer you,

02:00.815 --> 02:03.251
but we must have been
in a poor reception zone until now.

02:03.308 --> 02:05.995
<i>What do you mean? This is
the first I've tried to contact you.</i>

02:06.315 --> 02:09.413
Funny. But then who's been trying
to get ahold of me?

02:09.482 --> 02:11.450
<i>It does not matter.
There is a crisis</i>

02:11.517 --> 02:13.385
<i>and the Interceptor
is required immediately.</i>

02:13.453 --> 02:15.703
Right. Um, about the ship...

02:15.735 --> 02:19.391
We sort of had to use it as a battering
ram to stop Aya from eating the galaxy.

02:19.459 --> 02:22.909
- But we'll fly to you as fast as we can.
<i>- Never mind coming to Oa.</i>

02:22.930 --> 02:25.379
<i>You are to proceed immediately
to the planet Ranx.</i>

02:25.398 --> 02:28.621
<i>A huge Manhunter force is
presently attacking the planet.</i>

02:28.683 --> 02:32.939
Ranx? That abandoned place?
Why are they doing that?

02:32.960 --> 02:35.942
<i>Why, indeed, sergeant Kilowog.
That is the root of our concern.</i>

02:36.009 --> 02:38.343
<i>If Aya is trying to obtain
something from Ranx,</i>

02:38.376 --> 02:42.146
<i>the Guardians order you
to stop her, at all costs.</i>

03:04.823 --> 03:09.293
OK, ladies, let's show these glorified
blenders how the Corps rolls.

03:12.075 --> 03:16.452
Yes, our forward momentum is
extremely difficult to arrest.

03:33.370 --> 03:35.405
Uhh!

03:35.472 --> 03:37.808
Fall back! Fall back!

03:50.458 --> 03:52.792
We got our butts kicked
out there!

03:52.860 --> 03:54.928
Well, in your case,
exit vents.

03:54.996 --> 03:57.240
We need to thin out
their defensive line.

03:57.259 --> 03:59.481
I'm gonna re-strategize
with the other squad leaders.

03:59.521 --> 04:01.699
Until then, stay frosty.

04:02.803 --> 04:05.894
Ah. In space,
it is zero degrees Kelvin.

04:05.918 --> 04:08.398
Very frosty, indeed,
Lantern Gardner.

04:08.426 --> 04:10.844
<i>Not now, Chaselon.</i>

04:15.383 --> 04:18.113
Looks like we're late
to the party.

04:18.293 --> 04:21.591
Nah. This party's just getting
started now that you're here, buddy.

04:21.675 --> 04:23.876
Did you hear? I just got
bumped to Honor Guard.

04:23.943 --> 04:26.178
Hey, check you out.

04:26.246 --> 04:29.048
You gotta be kidding me. You?

04:29.115 --> 04:33.249
Well, Hank, they put me in charge
because you always lead with your ace,

04:33.292 --> 04:34.660
and that'd be me.

04:34.699 --> 04:37.991
I got promoted fastest ever
in the history of the Corps. It's true.

04:38.034 --> 04:40.358
It's Hal, and if you're
in the Honor Guard now,

04:40.394 --> 04:42.228
who's the new Lantern
for our sector?

04:42.295 --> 04:44.768
I don't know. Some other
Earth guy, what's-his-name.

04:44.799 --> 04:47.746
- John Stewart.
- The fake news guy?

04:47.776 --> 04:50.444
Perhaps you too can play "name
that Earthling" some other time.

04:50.511 --> 04:52.112
What is the situation?

04:52.180 --> 04:54.848
The Manhunters are after
something on that planet.

04:54.916 --> 04:56.972
<i>But that force field
is keeping them out.</i>

04:57.030 --> 04:59.381
<i>The Blue crew wants us
to get it first.</i>

04:59.420 --> 05:02.134
<i>The problem is, there's way more
of them than there are of us.</i>

05:02.202 --> 05:03.735
Something else is going on.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.604
I've been getting
this signal on my Ring.

05:05.672 --> 05:08.275
The closer we get to Ranx,
the stronger it becomes.

05:08.300 --> 05:11.136
Someone down there
is trying to contact us.

05:11.166 --> 05:16.276
Or not. No life signs on the planet,
which was abandoned 1,000 years ago.

05:16.323 --> 05:19.404
You probably just broke your Ring.
Did you leave it out in the rain?

05:19.428 --> 05:22.388
Were you dropped on your head
as a child? Never mind.

05:22.432 --> 05:24.626
We gotta get down there
and investigate.

05:24.641 --> 05:28.327
Nuhuh. The plan is to launch another
coordinated attack in a half hour.

05:28.395 --> 05:31.564
You can either be part of that
or benched. So which is it?

05:31.631 --> 05:33.804
Where the heck
do you get...

05:33.929 --> 05:35.868
We'll be in position.

05:36.552 --> 05:39.603
By the way, good thing
you got your tiny mask on,

05:39.634 --> 05:44.021
in case someone from this uninhabited
alien planet recognizes you.

05:50.685 --> 05:53.387
This is useless.
The Manhunters are programmed

05:53.455 --> 05:55.522
to detect and snuff out
all emotion.

05:55.590 --> 05:58.169
Once we get in their sensor range,
they'll just drive us back.

05:58.207 --> 06:00.512
Guy's plan is never
going to work.

06:00.538 --> 06:03.236
I can't believe
they put him in charge!

06:03.264 --> 06:07.267
It looks like someone needs Razer
to show them an anger management drill.

06:07.335 --> 06:10.203
Theoretically,
if we didn't possess emotions,

06:10.271 --> 06:12.795
we could pass through
the Manhunter blockade undetected.

06:12.819 --> 06:15.976
Ain't nothin' theoretical
about Manhunter cannons.

06:16.044 --> 06:17.800
What do you have in mind?

06:17.807 --> 06:20.188
The Blue Lantern meditation
I was taught on Odym

06:20.216 --> 06:22.351
was designed to purge
the mind of rage.

06:22.562 --> 06:25.764
Perhaps if applied carefully,
it could eliminate all emotions.

06:25.832 --> 06:29.041
We don't have time to practice
stuff it took you months to learn.

06:29.079 --> 06:32.053
True. But when I first came
to Odym, Saint Walker

06:32.080 --> 06:35.649
used a technique to calm my rage
when I was unable to do it myself.

06:36.053 --> 06:39.054
I believe I can replicate
that technique.

06:39.122 --> 06:43.391
Guy didn't say we had to go in blasting,
just that we had to go.

06:43.459 --> 06:47.162
Fine. So, how, exactly,
is this gonna work?

06:47.229 --> 06:51.499
Keep your minds focused
on the calmness of the lake.

06:53.736 --> 06:55.337
Squad leaders, we are go.

06:55.404 --> 06:58.270
Lanterns, I will see you
on the ground.

07:34.930 --> 07:38.360
I can't believe
this is actually working.

07:38.398 --> 07:42.233
Keep your mind
clear of all emotion.

07:59.303 --> 08:03.654
No emotions detected.
No action required.

08:03.680 --> 08:04.993
Aya...?

08:05.008 --> 08:08.610
Um, why does that Manhunter
sound like that?

08:08.678 --> 08:11.146
You're not thinking
about the lake.

08:14.517 --> 08:18.085
Oh, no. Hold it together, Razer.

08:23.426 --> 08:25.661
That's not her.

08:29.918 --> 08:32.385
Emotions detected.

08:34.784 --> 08:37.251
Gnuts.

08:39.462 --> 08:43.352
Emotions detected.
The punishment is death.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.831
What now, Jordan?

08:58.573 --> 09:01.548
- Go straight at the shield.
- What?

09:05.307 --> 09:08.549
- Are you insane?
- Follow me!

09:25.966 --> 09:30.237
- I knew I was right!
- This is you being right?

09:46.720 --> 09:48.254
Incoming!

09:53.594 --> 09:57.456
I'm telling you,
someone invited us here.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.334
This way!

10:15.413 --> 10:21.018
Stupid robots. You remind me of my VCR,
and I showed it who was boss.

10:23.205 --> 10:26.793
Will you guys get off me?
I'm trying to pick a fight here.

10:38.413 --> 10:40.719
Disco Lantern,
give me a status report.

10:40.787 --> 10:43.948
All of the teams
are repelled, except one.

10:43.974 --> 10:45.915
Let me guess...

10:45.954 --> 10:48.155
Honor Guard Hal Jordan.

11:03.176 --> 11:05.077
Quick, in there!

11:12.784 --> 11:14.518
What is this place?

11:14.586 --> 11:17.888
I don't know. But someone
clearly wants us here.

11:17.956 --> 11:21.725
Last time I checked, invited guests
don't get ordnance shot at them.

11:21.792 --> 11:25.962
Unless you're at my uncle's
ranch for a Firewing Festival.

11:48.841 --> 11:51.270
Emotions detected.

11:51.489 --> 11:53.323
Aya hunters!

11:53.391 --> 11:55.158
Go!

11:59.664 --> 12:01.799
Still following the signal.

12:01.867 --> 12:05.105
- Jordan, you're taking us in a circle!
- Getting closer.

12:06.204 --> 12:09.574
Closer to being dead.
Figure it out already!

12:33.799 --> 12:36.334
See? I told you so.
Invited guests.

12:36.402 --> 12:38.496
There's probably even a sauna.

12:40.560 --> 12:44.196
I don't see no sauna.
Looks more like a prison cell.

12:44.264 --> 12:48.615
- Maybe it's just a holding area.
- Or a killing floor.

12:53.205 --> 12:57.208
This thing is mighty strong.
We're gonna need all 3 of us!

13:03.012 --> 13:04.513
Uhh!

13:04.554 --> 13:07.799
What part of "all 3 of us"
do you not understand?

13:07.845 --> 13:12.348
Hey! Whoever you are, you called
us here from across the galaxy.

13:14.490 --> 13:17.358
It couldn't have been
just to crush us to death.

13:17.402 --> 13:19.236
Don't do this!

13:19.266 --> 13:22.935
It's me, Hal Jordan!
We've come to help!

13:31.399 --> 13:35.636
I see I was not mistaken
to direct my message at you.

13:35.703 --> 13:37.971
No way.

13:38.039 --> 13:40.173
No possible way.

13:40.241 --> 13:43.143
You are as resourceful
as I'd hoped, Hal Jordan.

13:43.210 --> 13:47.814
Welcome to Ranx,
the new home of the Anti-Monitor.

13:54.840 --> 13:57.942
You... You corrupted Aya!

13:58.010 --> 13:59.544
Choose wisely.

13:59.611 --> 14:03.815
My power is the only thing keeping
the Manhunter hordes at bay.

14:03.860 --> 14:05.180
Razer, wait!

14:05.204 --> 14:08.555
If you were calling for help,
why were you trying to kill us?

14:08.570 --> 14:11.477
I was eliminating the Manhunters
that followed you here

14:11.545 --> 14:14.380
through the hole
in the force field I created.

14:14.448 --> 14:16.216
What do you want from us?

14:16.283 --> 14:19.559
And how can you even be alive
after Aya tore your head off?

14:19.590 --> 14:24.294
Your concept of life is no
more complete than a worm's.

14:25.797 --> 14:30.500
<i>The artificial intelligence you call Aya
appeared to kill me,</i>

14:30.568 --> 14:34.338
<i>but her attack merely separated
the helmet from a suit of armor.</i>

14:34.406 --> 14:39.510
<i>My life force clung to the upper shell,
and I survived the assault.</i>

14:39.578 --> 14:43.791
<i>I felt the pull of an automated presence,
as with the Manhunters,</i>

14:43.817 --> 14:49.320
<i>yet different, more complex,
more expansive.</i>

15:00.693 --> 15:03.801
<i>My plan was to use
the resources of this world</i>

15:03.869 --> 15:10.008
<i>to recharge myself until I could rise
once again, even more powerful.</i>

15:19.219 --> 15:23.123
Then, as the I.A. commanded,
the Manhunters came.

15:23.190 --> 15:26.755
What does she want from you?
Why is she sending her armies here?

15:26.795 --> 15:29.851
I was created to probe
the mystery of creation,

15:29.866 --> 15:33.334
to travel to the very birth
of the Universe itself.

15:33.402 --> 15:37.004
A time-displacement cylinder
is a component of this helm.

15:37.072 --> 15:41.642
I can only surmise Aya knows this now
and desires that ability.

15:41.709 --> 15:45.212
For what possible reason
would Aya want to time travel?

15:45.279 --> 15:47.981
To remake the Universe.

15:48.840 --> 15:51.754
If Aya can get back
to the moment before creation,

15:51.785 --> 15:54.355
she can use her new powers
to change it.

15:54.422 --> 15:56.824
Or stop it from
happening at all.

15:56.891 --> 16:00.327
No emotion would exist
because nothing would be alive.

16:00.394 --> 16:03.329
And that is the reason
I called you, Hal Jordan.

16:03.397 --> 16:05.898
I need your protection.

16:14.941 --> 16:19.678
OK, we're gonna punch through that shield
if it's the last thing Chaselon ever does.

16:19.745 --> 16:22.113
Just kidding, buddy.

16:23.515 --> 16:25.583
Buddy.

16:26.233 --> 16:30.348
- Why should we help you?
- Our fates are now as one.

16:30.387 --> 16:32.790
It is in your best interest
to help me.

16:32.858 --> 16:36.092
I am also a living
sentient being in distress.

16:36.131 --> 16:40.699
Your order is bound by oath
to render aid to any in my position.

16:40.766 --> 16:43.535
The only thing you're in position for
is a headache, pal.

16:43.603 --> 16:47.317
Settle down.
We have to do this.

16:47.356 --> 16:51.375
- Unbelievable.
- That thing is evil.

16:51.414 --> 16:53.946
It deserves to be destroyed
and you want us to protect it?

16:54.014 --> 16:57.350
Hear me out. Yes, the Anti-Monitor
would eat the universe if it could.

16:57.417 --> 17:00.486
But it's injured, so that's not
gonna happen anytime soon.

17:00.554 --> 17:04.217
What Aya is planning
is the negation of all life.

17:04.280 --> 17:06.393
We can't let her do that.

17:07.001 --> 17:09.396
I despise that
you have a point.

17:09.761 --> 17:13.597
It looks like you've got
yourself a few bodyguards.

17:27.681 --> 17:29.982
Step on those fools!

17:39.859 --> 17:42.861
That, my friend,
is a high-value target.

17:42.929 --> 17:45.730
Turn these constructs around
and fire at will!

18:05.051 --> 18:06.918
Uhh!

18:18.166 --> 18:20.314
Move aside, my children.

18:20.355 --> 18:23.258
Your Queen is here
and will lead the way.

19:07.939 --> 19:12.168
It is too late. The I.A. comes.
The destroyer comes.

19:20.338 --> 19:23.440
- Aya! Listen to me.
- Silence.

19:23.508 --> 19:25.175
- Uhh!
- Uhh!

19:25.243 --> 19:29.060
The last time we spoke,
you tried to assassinate me.

19:29.122 --> 19:33.132
I will receive no more communications
from emotional beings.

19:33.230 --> 19:35.398
Their data is corrupting.

19:35.466 --> 19:39.135
Nothing any of you can say
will make a difference.

19:48.611 --> 19:51.702
I agree. The carbon
life forms are useless.

19:51.717 --> 19:54.279
Kill them and we will
strike a bargain.

19:54.624 --> 19:56.451
I know why you've come.

19:56.518 --> 19:59.063
I will guide you
to the beginning of time.

19:59.125 --> 20:03.292
Once we are there, you may do
with the Universe as you wish.

20:04.109 --> 20:07.025
I have a counter proposal.

20:33.278 --> 20:38.996
Aya, when we met, I believed myself
guilty of killing thousands.

20:39.063 --> 20:41.929
You saved me
from that burden.

20:42.409 --> 20:46.045
Do not add any more lives
to the millions you have taken already.

20:46.079 --> 20:48.072
You will be able to bear it.

20:48.140 --> 20:54.145
You have no conception of what I have
done or what I am capable of doing.

20:55.481 --> 20:58.516
I suppose you're going
to kill us now.

20:58.584 --> 21:01.353
Kill you?
That is unnecessary.

21:01.421 --> 21:04.923
Soon you will never
have existed at all.

21:11.331 --> 21:15.635
We are in serious trouble.
What are we gonna do?

21:15.703 --> 21:19.305
I was wrong.
There is no hope for her.

21:19.373 --> 21:24.511
Our only choice
is to destroy her.

21:25.056 --> 21:28.056
