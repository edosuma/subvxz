E. R.

00:04.070 --> 00:05.071
Previously on E. R.

00:05.172 --> 00:06.036
Hey, Rachel!

00:06.137 --> 00:08.708
- You search my room and private things!
- I was looking for drugs!

00:08.809 --> 00:10.891
I have a baby
with an amphetamine overdose.

00:10.992 --> 00:13.359
- Oh, God!
- She may never open her eyes again.

00:13.460 --> 00:15.493
Either she's out of the house by
the time I take that baby home...

00:15.528 --> 00:17.040
or I'm not taking that baby home.

00:17.141 --> 00:19.326
I'm afraid
it's definitely tumor re-growth.

00:20.261 --> 00:22.292
You should've been dead
a year ago, Mark.

00:22.993 --> 00:25.029
How much time?

00:27.080 --> 00:29.129
Mark died this morning...

00:30.585 --> 00:32.762
...at 6:04 a. m.

00:35.592 --> 00:37.784
The sun was rising,
his favorite time of day.

00:38.369 --> 00:41.324
E. R. 8x21 "ON THE BEACH"

00:41.502 --> 00:44.187
- You set the tone, Carter.
- What?

00:46.717 --> 00:48.376
Work on your jump shot.

02:12.403 --> 02:14.062
Mark.

02:14.279 --> 02:15.558
Hey.

02:15.738 --> 02:19.901
- What are you doing?
- I'm feeling sorry for myself.

02:21.284 --> 02:24.948
- I made you some soup.
- No, thanks.

02:25.119 --> 02:27.195
Do you want me to put some drops
in your eye?

02:27.371 --> 02:29.115
I just did it.

02:29.832 --> 02:32.322
Just making a list.

02:32.500 --> 02:36.284
Things I've always wanted to do
but I never found time for.

02:37.128 --> 02:39.702
- What, too morbid?
- A bit.

02:39.881 --> 02:43.248
- You wanna hear it?
- Sure.

02:44.217 --> 02:46.256
Got a little carried away.

02:47.094 --> 02:49.216
"Sail around the world.

02:49.387 --> 02:51.426
Climb Mount Kilimanjaro.

02:51.597 --> 02:55.427
Play third base for the Cubs and hit a
sacrifice fly to drive in the winning run...

02:55.600 --> 02:58.386
...in the seventh game of
the World Series." They get better.

02:59.519 --> 03:02.473
"Start a garage band and end up
on the cover of Rolling Stone."

03:02.647 --> 03:04.437
Do you even play an instrument?

03:04.606 --> 03:07.725
No, but I've always wanted to trash
a hotel room.

03:07.942 --> 03:11.986
"Jump out of an airplane.
Have noisy sex in a public place."

03:12.353 --> 03:13.647
I can help you with that one.

03:13.920 --> 03:18.979
"Smoke hand-rolled Cuban cigars
while drinking dark Caribbean rum...

03:19.158 --> 03:23.369
...in a sidewalk cafÃ©
overlooking the Havana seawall."

03:23.536 --> 03:25.409
That's a really good one.

03:25.579 --> 03:29.742
"Get towed into Maverick's
on a big gun and live to tell about it.

03:30.082 --> 03:33.332
Find Jerry Walker
and beat the living crap out of him."

03:33.502 --> 03:37.166
- And who's he?
- Tenth grade. Long story.

03:37.672 --> 03:40.078
"Take the kids to Disney World.

03:40.256 --> 03:45.296
Teach Ella how to ice-skate
at Rockefeller Center at Christmastime.

03:45.551 --> 03:48.754
Teach Rachel how to drive.

03:50.222 --> 03:54.847
Be there to give them both away
at their weddings."

03:55.642 --> 03:58.677
I told you I was sitting down here
feeling sorry for myself.

03:58.853 --> 04:02.303
We could all go to Disney World.
I'd like that.

04:03.189 --> 04:05.645
I haven't been a very good father.

04:05.816 --> 04:09.231
- Yes, you have.
- No, I haven't.

04:09.444 --> 04:13.488
I wasn't there when she needed me.
I was 400 miles away.

04:13.656 --> 04:18.031
A phone call on Saturdays.
A couple of weeks in the summer.

04:19.576 --> 04:22.197
You know what the last thing
on my list is?

04:24.830 --> 04:27.149
"Fix Rachel."

05:31.088 --> 05:32.582
Rachel.

05:33.716 --> 05:35.424
Rachel!

05:37.219 --> 05:39.295
- See you. Bye.
- Bye.

05:41.264 --> 05:42.758
Hey.

05:43.224 --> 05:44.801
Breath mint?

05:44.934 --> 05:47.056
- For that cigarette?
- I was holding it for a friend.

05:47.228 --> 05:48.888
In your mouth?

05:49.563 --> 05:51.721
- What are you doing here?
- Picking you up.

05:51.899 --> 05:54.223
- Anything in your locker you need?
- What?

05:54.400 --> 05:56.689
- Is there anything you need right away?
- No.

05:56.862 --> 05:58.652
Okay, come on.

06:01.657 --> 06:03.400
Where are we going?

06:03.742 --> 06:06.862
Honestly, Rachel, I don't know.

06:15.586 --> 06:17.377
Here we go!

06:46.697 --> 06:49.817
- Is that your dad?
- Yeah.

06:50.284 --> 06:51.992
Midlife crisis?

06:52.161 --> 06:54.449
Something like that.

07:04.797 --> 07:06.955
- Aloha.
- Morning.

07:24.065 --> 07:25.558
Hey.

07:25.733 --> 07:27.690
- What?
- You hungry?

07:27.860 --> 07:29.982
- What time is it?
- It's almost 8.

07:31.070 --> 07:32.316
Oh, God.

07:32.489 --> 07:35.406
Told you not to stay up late
watching that movie.

07:35.575 --> 07:38.409
Come on, time's a-wasting.
Gotta go.

07:38.577 --> 07:41.282
- Go where?
- History lesson.

07:41.455 --> 07:44.325
- What?
- My history.

07:46.709 --> 07:49.793
- What's with this music?
- You don't like Todd Rundgren?

07:49.962 --> 07:53.081
- Can we change the station?
- No. I like this.

07:55.884 --> 07:58.755
- This is where everything blew up?
- Yeah.

07:58.929 --> 08:00.637
That's Battleship Row.

08:00.806 --> 08:02.596
See the white building?

08:03.349 --> 08:06.018
That's the Arizona Memorial.

08:06.352 --> 08:08.510
When I was a kid,
there wasn't a bridge here.

08:08.687 --> 08:11.558
You used to have to take the ferry
back and forth to school...

08:11.732 --> 08:13.771
...to the movies, to shop.

08:14.818 --> 08:16.691
It was kind of cool.

08:18.154 --> 08:20.194
I loved living in Hawaii.

08:20.365 --> 08:23.282
Mom had flower gardens everywhere.

08:23.451 --> 08:27.318
That's what she used to do when Dad
was gone, to keep busy. Garden.

08:27.496 --> 08:32.784
I hated it. She used to make me weed,
fertilize, mow the lawn.

08:34.501 --> 08:36.328
Last ferry was at 11:00,

08:36.419 --> 08:39.291
so Navy kids
mostly just stayed on the base.

08:39.664 --> 08:45.452
The golf course, you know, the pool,
bowling alley, youth center.

08:45.929 --> 08:48.716
- You were a bowler?
- Yeah.

08:49.056 --> 08:52.390
Mostly just rode our bikes around,
went to the beach...

08:52.560 --> 08:56.557
...got in trouble
trying to sneak into restricted areas.

08:57.648 --> 08:59.142
How long were you here?

08:59.316 --> 09:01.059
Three years.

09:01.818 --> 09:04.569
Longest time we ever spent
in one place.

09:07.782 --> 09:10.486
All the good kids were JROTC,

09:10.577 --> 09:11.987
hoping to get into Annapolis.

09:12.160 --> 09:14.201
I hung out with the troublemakers.

09:14.372 --> 09:19.661
A couple of teenagers
acting dangerous, tough.

09:19.835 --> 09:21.458
I had my first job here.

09:21.629 --> 09:24.830
- You were a lifeguard?
- No. Junior janitor.

09:25.005 --> 09:30.675
I'd get here at 6 a. m., sweep up,
mop the locker rooms, skim the pool.

09:30.845 --> 09:32.920
$1.25 an hour.

09:33.096 --> 09:35.005
That's slave wages.

09:35.181 --> 09:38.716
It was enough to keep me in
new records and good weed.

09:42.521 --> 09:46.305
What? You know, records, LPs, vinyls.

09:46.484 --> 09:50.433
Those funny, big, black things that your
hip-hop heroes rip off for their songs.

09:53.531 --> 09:55.025
Come on.

09:55.491 --> 09:57.947
I wanna show you something,
just a couple blocks away.

09:58.119 --> 10:02.910
Sixteen-inch guns
could lob a 2000-pound shell 23 miles.

10:03.082 --> 10:06.865
When a bombardment commenced,
you could hear it 40 miles away.

10:07.293 --> 10:11.789
Up there's where
the Japanese surrendered. Tokyo Harbor.

10:13.049 --> 10:15.373
Your grandfather took me up
to the bridge once.

10:15.550 --> 10:19.762
Not here on the Missouri, but on
a sub tender that he was the XO of.

10:19.929 --> 10:24.176
They used to let sailors bring families
onboard, steam around the harbor.

10:24.350 --> 10:28.977
Kind of a take-your-kid-to-work day,
only Dad's office was a warship.

10:29.438 --> 10:33.815
He introduced me to all the sailors
on watch, stuck a hat on me.

10:33.984 --> 10:37.934
- One of those white Gilligan things?
- Yeah.

10:38.321 --> 10:43.481
Held me up so I could man the helm,
showed me what everything was for.

10:43.659 --> 10:45.153
I was about your age.

10:46.870 --> 10:48.827
Sounds like you liked it.

10:49.665 --> 10:51.159
I did.

10:51.875 --> 10:53.998
So why didn't you join the Navy?

10:55.628 --> 10:57.206
I was mad at my dad.

10:58.589 --> 11:02.337
- For what?
- Never being around, I guess.

11:03.176 --> 11:05.668
We used to fight all the time.

11:07.514 --> 11:12.508
About music I listened to, my clothes,
my friends, the length of my hair.

11:12.685 --> 11:16.849
Don't laugh, I used to have hair.
Lots of it.

11:17.106 --> 11:19.181
Down to my shoulders.

11:21.693 --> 11:25.773
He resented my politics.
I hated his.

11:25.947 --> 11:29.896
I used to try and provoke him, you know,
just try to piss him off.

11:30.075 --> 11:32.033
I was good at it.

11:32.787 --> 11:35.538
I hated everything that he stood for...

11:36.790 --> 11:39.197
...and I made sure that he knew it.

11:39.835 --> 11:41.079
What did he stand for?

11:41.252 --> 11:45.499
Patriotism, responsibility,
authority, honor.

11:47.508 --> 11:49.630
The Navy, most of all.

11:51.262 --> 11:54.048
I'd take it all back now if I could.

11:54.348 --> 11:55.628
But I can't.

11:59.101 --> 12:02.434
He rode me pretty hard
when he was around.

12:03.397 --> 12:05.888
I think he was worried about me.

12:07.735 --> 12:09.941
He was worried about the choices
I was making...

12:10.112 --> 12:12.602
...and the things that I was interested in.

12:12.781 --> 12:14.061
Like what?

12:15.200 --> 12:16.694
Like...

12:17.285 --> 12:19.906
...girls, for one.

12:20.371 --> 12:23.870
Bruce Lee flicks, rock 'n' roll, surfing.

12:24.041 --> 12:25.914
- Surfing?
- Yeah.

12:26.084 --> 12:27.329
Don't look so surprised.

12:28.753 --> 12:29.997
Surfing?

12:30.630 --> 12:34.164
You're doing great.
You almost stood up on that last one.

12:34.341 --> 12:36.133
Okay, lie down.

12:37.385 --> 12:39.094
- I'm gonna push you. Ready?
- Yeah.

12:41.431 --> 12:43.009
- You ready?
- Yeah.

12:43.183 --> 12:46.386
Paddle, paddle, paddle, paddle!
Go, go!

12:48.104 --> 12:50.060
Stand up!

12:50.732 --> 12:52.605
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

12:54.568 --> 12:56.643
Oh, my God!

12:57.029 --> 12:58.523
Yes!

13:44.320 --> 13:45.816
Dad?

13:47.907 --> 13:48.859
Dad?

15:13.405 --> 15:15.481
You know this one, right?

15:18.075 --> 15:20.115
You gotta know who this is.

15:35.673 --> 15:37.581
What is this place?

15:37.757 --> 15:40.592
It's a retreat house.
I rented it for a week.

15:40.760 --> 15:43.796
- A what?
- Relax. You're gonna love it.

16:05.738 --> 16:07.233
There's no TV in my room.

16:11.535 --> 16:13.158
- Right.
- Where's the TV?

16:13.786 --> 16:15.826
I don't think there is one.

16:16.456 --> 16:17.735
Is there a pool?

16:18.708 --> 16:20.202
Ocean.

16:20.792 --> 16:23.164
Hotel was getting too expensive.

16:23.337 --> 16:26.539
The minibar charges alone
were starting to add up.

16:27.881 --> 16:30.503
Once you're done unpacking,
you can help me with dinner.

16:31.718 --> 16:33.045
Is there a phone?

16:34.346 --> 16:36.882
Should be around here someplace.

16:37.640 --> 16:39.845
- What are we supposed to do?
- I don't know.

16:40.016 --> 16:43.218
Swim, walk on the beach...

16:43.394 --> 16:44.887
...surf.

17:07.954 --> 17:11.157
Put your right foot on the brake,
left foot on the clutch.

17:11.833 --> 17:13.375
Good. Clutch all the way in.

17:13.544 --> 17:15.500
Okay, now put it in first gear.

17:15.670 --> 17:18.290
Remember where that is?
Just straight up. Good, good.

17:18.464 --> 17:21.085
Okay, now, you wanna ease
your right foot off of the brake...

17:21.258 --> 17:22.752
...and onto the accelerator.

17:22.925 --> 17:25.297
Okay, ease off on the clutch.

17:25.469 --> 17:27.461
A little gas.
Ease off on the clutch.

17:27.637 --> 17:29.796
Hey, there you go.

17:32.057 --> 17:33.386
- What'd I do?
- It's all right.

17:33.560 --> 17:35.218
It's just a balance thing, you know?

17:35.393 --> 17:38.893
It's kind of a balance between
the clutch and the accelerator.

17:39.063 --> 17:41.981
It's a feel thing.
It just takes a little practice.

17:43.692 --> 17:45.270
All right, let's try it again.

17:45.444 --> 17:47.186
Okay, make sure it's in neutral.

17:47.361 --> 17:49.271
Good. Put that clutch in.

17:49.447 --> 17:52.733
Put the brake on.
Okay, turn the ignition over.

17:54.326 --> 17:57.362
Okay, make sure that clutch
is pushed all the way in.

17:58.579 --> 18:00.571
- Got it in neutral.
- I- okay.

18:00.748 --> 18:02.620
Turn the ignition over again.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.665
Okay, now put it up into first.

18:09.588 --> 18:12.423
Okay, right foot off of that brake,
put it on the accelerator.

18:12.590 --> 18:13.836
Ease off the clutch.

18:20.347 --> 18:24.178
- Maybe I should try an automatic.
- No, no. It's best to learn with a stick.

18:24.350 --> 18:26.176
Mom has an automatic.

18:26.351 --> 18:27.679
Come on, put it in neutral.

18:28.937 --> 18:31.771
- I don't want to.
- Rachel, if you fall off the horse...

18:31.940 --> 18:33.896
...you gotta get right back on.

18:34.274 --> 18:36.848
- The horse?
- Come on. You almost got it.

18:37.027 --> 18:38.355
Let's go.

18:38.527 --> 18:41.861
There you go. Right foot on the brake,
left foot on the clutch. Neutral.

18:42.031 --> 18:43.690
Start it up.

18:45.242 --> 18:46.735
There you go.

18:46.910 --> 18:48.700
There you go.

18:49.287 --> 18:51.243
Okay, let off that clutch.

18:51.956 --> 18:53.579
Let it off.

18:56.584 --> 19:00.581
Hey, hey! We're going. We're driving.
We're driving, we're driving!

19:00.754 --> 19:02.378
- Okay, now shift.
- What?

19:02.547 --> 19:04.586
- Shift. Put it into second.
- How? What?

19:04.757 --> 19:06.381
Clutch in.
Pull it down to second.

19:06.883 --> 19:09.042
Second. Yeah, yeah, that's it.

19:09.719 --> 19:12.424
Good, yes!
We're driving!

19:12.597 --> 19:14.837
We're driving!
We're free!

19:21.604 --> 19:23.099
Dad?

19:26.150 --> 19:27.644
Dad?

19:33.822 --> 19:35.317
Dad?

19:36.575 --> 19:38.365
Are you okay?

19:39.494 --> 19:40.987
Yeah.

19:43.247 --> 19:44.906
Your headache back?

19:50.084 --> 19:51.793
I'm all right.

19:53.588 --> 19:56.873
Well, I was gonna go to the beach.

19:57.049 --> 19:58.377
Okay.

19:58.551 --> 20:00.342
Are you coming?

20:01.594 --> 20:03.422
Be down there in a minute.

20:24.863 --> 20:26.939
Beautiful, isn't it?

20:31.118 --> 20:32.612
Hey.

20:34.037 --> 20:36.113
It's beautiful, huh?

20:36.998 --> 20:40.947
- Your headache better?
- Yeah, thanks.

20:41.335 --> 20:43.493
What are you listening to?

20:43.795 --> 20:45.621
You wouldn't like it.

20:57.598 --> 20:59.886
When did you start getting high?

21:00.892 --> 21:02.517
I don't.

21:02.769 --> 21:06.636
I was loaded most of the eighth grade.
I'm no fool. Stop treating me like one.

21:06.814 --> 21:08.687
I don't get high.

21:09.900 --> 21:12.271
I'm missing three Vicodin.

21:12.527 --> 21:14.768
Any idea what happened to them?

21:15.488 --> 21:18.654
Maybe you took them and forgot.

21:20.365 --> 21:22.405
What else are you doing?

21:22.743 --> 21:26.527
We know about the Ecstasy.
Now the Vicodin.

21:26.705 --> 21:29.029
- Huffing? Speed?
- I already told you, nothing.

21:29.207 --> 21:31.579
Crystal meth, what?

21:32.167 --> 21:35.702
- You don't believe me, fine!
- Rachel.

21:35.962 --> 21:38.334
Rachel! Rach!

21:38.505 --> 21:40.213
You're only 14.

21:40.382 --> 21:43.584
What the hell are you gonna be putting
in your body when you're 16?

21:43.760 --> 21:45.753
We're gonna talk about this.

21:45.929 --> 21:48.548
Rachel, damn it, stop.

21:49.682 --> 21:53.097
I love you.
Please, don't do this.

21:53.268 --> 21:54.810
I don't...

21:55.811 --> 21:57.769
I don't know what to do.

21:57.938 --> 22:02.398
I don't have time to work this through.
I'm not gonna be here in a year to help.

22:02.566 --> 22:05.686
You got a bastard of a father
who was never around...

22:05.861 --> 22:08.019
...and then went off
and had a new baby.

22:08.196 --> 22:11.315
Your mom got remarried to a creep,
she works too much.

22:11.490 --> 22:16.068
You got a raw deal, all right?
Why not get high?

22:16.285 --> 22:18.408
No one gives a damn about you anyway.

22:18.579 --> 22:21.035
I know how that feels.

22:21.540 --> 22:26.699
I remember being 14 and pissed off
at my dad and the world.

22:27.837 --> 22:29.793
What are you gonna do
when I'm not here?

22:29.964 --> 22:33.878
Who is gonna keep you
from killing yourself? I'm scared.

22:34.217 --> 22:36.922
Scared about what's gonna
happen to you.

22:37.511 --> 22:41.722
Look, it sucks!
I'm your father, and I'm gonna die.

22:41.890 --> 22:45.341
You know what?
I think it sucks too.

22:53.983 --> 22:56.142
No, it's- Yeah.

22:56.319 --> 22:57.978
No, it's fine.

22:58.236 --> 22:59.980
I'm great.

23:01.072 --> 23:02.400
No, I'm feeling good.

23:02.573 --> 23:04.068
- All right.
- How's Ella?

23:04.242 --> 23:07.076
She's wonderful.
The tooth finally grew in.

23:07.243 --> 23:08.489
- Really?
- Yeah, finally.

23:08.661 --> 23:10.986
- That's great.
- How's Rachel doing?

23:11.496 --> 23:13.454
She's fine.

23:14.124 --> 23:15.867
You know...

23:16.126 --> 23:17.619
...fourteen.

23:45.358 --> 23:47.481
You wanna go out to dinner
or eat here?

23:47.651 --> 23:50.105
I think we have some of that ono left.

23:50.278 --> 23:52.436
Vegetables, ice-

23:52.613 --> 23:54.771
I want pizza.
Can we get some pizza?

23:54.949 --> 23:59.693
There's that place down by the surf shop
that looked pretty good. Some olive-

24:00.370 --> 24:01.863
Dad?

24:02.204 --> 24:03.995
God, Dad?

24:04.706 --> 24:06.955
Dad? Dad?

24:40.372 --> 24:41.866
Mark?

24:46.252 --> 24:47.746
Mark!

24:51.048 --> 24:53.171
Oh, my goodness, look.

24:59.223 --> 25:00.717
Mark?

25:10.899 --> 25:12.228
Hi.

25:17.989 --> 25:19.531
Hi.

25:23.828 --> 25:27.031
We were out driving around,
I saw the vacation-rental sign.

25:27.206 --> 25:31.250
- It must cost a fortune.
- You only live once.

25:31.668 --> 25:35.583
There's a lady named Janet. She lives
up the road, takes care of children.

25:35.755 --> 25:38.425
She said she'd be happy to help out.

25:38.592 --> 25:42.541
- What's this?
- Herbs. Got a whole bunch of them.

25:42.720 --> 25:46.670
Take them in the morning, the afternoon.
Boosts my immune system.

25:46.849 --> 25:49.518
- Is this snakeskin?
- Could be.

25:49.685 --> 25:53.053
The lady who does my acupuncture
gave them to me.

25:53.230 --> 25:54.772
Couldn't hurt.

25:54.981 --> 25:57.306
I can't find a corkscrew.
How about a beer?

25:57.483 --> 25:58.977
Sure.

25:59.903 --> 26:01.811
So where's Rachel?

26:02.029 --> 26:03.856
She's out surfing.

26:06.784 --> 26:09.109
She found you in a grand mal seizure.

26:09.745 --> 26:11.025
It's no big deal.

26:11.204 --> 26:13.446
She was scared to death
when she called me.

26:13.623 --> 26:16.789
- What did the neurologist say?
- Up the Dilantin to 400.

26:16.960 --> 26:18.951
You didn't see a doctor?

26:19.295 --> 26:21.537
- Nope.
- How do you know what your level is?

26:22.173 --> 26:23.548
I'm fine.

26:23.716 --> 26:25.792
Mark, you need a CAT scan
and a full workup.

26:26.552 --> 26:28.259
No, thanks.

26:31.806 --> 26:34.095
Take my hand.
Come on.

26:34.267 --> 26:36.141
Squeeze my fingers.

26:42.232 --> 26:44.225
What about your wrist?

26:45.819 --> 26:47.527
Your elbow?

26:49.864 --> 26:51.406
All right, we're going home.

26:51.575 --> 26:54.694
You need an MRI
and to see the neurologist.

26:55.328 --> 26:56.822
No.

26:59.289 --> 27:01.614
I don't wanna go back home.

27:07.964 --> 27:10.668
It's beautiful here, isn't it?

27:13.928 --> 27:16.216
Come on, let me show you the beach.

27:21.351 --> 27:23.758
What's she gonna do with a surfboard
in St. Louis?

27:23.936 --> 27:25.894
Let it gather dust in the garage.

27:26.064 --> 27:29.183
- Has she been like this the whole time?
- Pretty much.

27:29.359 --> 27:30.853
Lucky you.

27:31.027 --> 27:34.727
- Hey, I never knew they were so tall.
- Some are. Some aren't.

27:40.702 --> 27:44.533
Hey, I'm looking for a long board
for my daughter. She's 14.

27:44.705 --> 27:49.082
- How long were you thinking?
- Nine, 9' 1 ". Maybe a Hamilton.

27:51.086 --> 27:53.328
- What's she doing?
- It's okay.

27:53.505 --> 27:56.459
- Does she even want a surfboard?
- Watch this.

27:56.634 --> 27:58.128
I know.

27:58.301 --> 28:00.874
- Who's he?
- Don't stare. It'll upset her.

28:01.053 --> 28:03.723
- Well, does she know him?
- He works here. His name's Kai.

28:03.889 --> 28:07.140
- Kai?
- Kai. It means "ocean."

28:07.309 --> 28:11.686
She's made up a new excuse why we
had to come back the last three days.

28:12.731 --> 28:14.225
- How old is he?
- I don't know.

28:14.400 --> 28:16.391
- He looks at least 16.
- Could be.

28:16.567 --> 28:18.062
Maybe 17.

28:18.236 --> 28:21.320
I have some boards she might like.
A Papa San and a Sunburnt.

28:21.489 --> 28:22.983
Good.

29:05.320 --> 29:08.072
Rachel, can you come and help me?

29:19.249 --> 29:22.036
Remember when
I used to sing you to sleep?

29:22.294 --> 29:23.788
No.

29:25.171 --> 29:28.125
You made me do it for years.

29:30.635 --> 29:34.133
You watched The Wizard of Oz
and The Little Mermaid...

29:34.305 --> 29:39.643
...over and over again.
It'd drive me crazy.

29:42.312 --> 29:46.144
We had that apartment off of Division
with the big iron gates out front...

29:46.316 --> 29:49.233
...and that funny-looking mutt
next door. Dudley?

29:49.402 --> 29:50.813
Dad.

29:50.986 --> 29:54.070
There was a playground across
the street. Remember the big slide?

29:54.240 --> 29:55.734
I don't.

29:55.908 --> 29:58.660
I don't remember, okay?
I don't remember any of that stuff!

29:58.827 --> 30:02.990
It's not important! And you just keep
talking and talking about it!

30:03.165 --> 30:05.073
- It is important.
- No, it's not!

30:05.750 --> 30:08.206
Where you used to live,
where we used to live...

30:08.378 --> 30:12.291
...and Grandmom's stupid garden,
Granddad's cousin Dave, or whatever.

30:12.464 --> 30:15.500
Rachel, keep your voice down.
The baby's sleeping.

30:17.177 --> 30:21.803
I'm trying to tell you about us,
about our family, our history.

30:21.973 --> 30:25.508
- It's stupid, boring, useless crap!
- It's not crap!

30:25.685 --> 30:27.926
- Some dog named Dudley?
- You loved that dog.

30:28.103 --> 30:31.057
I don't care about these things!
I don't wanna hear this stuff!

30:31.232 --> 30:34.517
So just stop talking to me about it.

30:46.037 --> 30:47.614
I'll go.

31:11.393 --> 31:14.062
How long are you planning
on keeping this up?

31:17.107 --> 31:20.391
He's not perfect.
Far from it.

31:20.860 --> 31:23.102
But he's trying.

31:24.905 --> 31:27.574
You've got to grow up
faster than you should have to.

31:27.741 --> 31:30.907
You don't get to be a child anymore.
Your father's dying.

31:31.078 --> 31:32.904
I know that.

31:34.414 --> 31:38.245
He's going to die soon.
Very soon.

31:38.501 --> 31:43.411
If you keep on like this, you're gonna miss
what little time you have left with him.

31:46.800 --> 31:49.469
This is it, Rachel.

31:49.636 --> 31:52.091
This is your last chance.

31:53.014 --> 31:58.719
And if you blow it, you're gonna end up
hating yourself for the rest of your life.

33:17.048 --> 33:18.327
Shit!

33:40.373 --> 33:42.449
I'm a bit worried about that cough.

33:42.625 --> 33:43.906
It's okay.

33:44.086 --> 33:46.838
We could go to the hospital
and get a CBC and a chest x-ray.

33:47.005 --> 33:48.286
No, thanks.

33:48.465 --> 33:51.252
Mark, the Decadron's
suppressing your immune system.

33:51.426 --> 33:52.707
No kidding.

33:52.887 --> 33:54.926
Did you up it again?

33:55.305 --> 33:58.757
Okay, well, if it turns to pneumonia,
we can give IV antibiotics.

33:58.935 --> 34:00.180
Pneumonia, huh?

34:00.353 --> 34:02.808
That's not a bad way to go.

34:06.108 --> 34:07.603
Okay.

34:08.235 --> 34:09.978
There you go.

34:10.655 --> 34:15.364
- Where's Rachel?
- She's at Sunset with Kai.

34:16.202 --> 34:18.693
Nice offshore breeze.

34:19.081 --> 34:21.157
Waves should be great.

34:23.127 --> 34:25.284
They're spending a great deal
of time together.

34:26.672 --> 34:28.664
He's a nice kid.

34:30.092 --> 34:31.337
So you're not worried?

34:32.428 --> 34:34.136
About what?

34:34.304 --> 34:36.464
About what they might be doing
in all that time.

34:36.641 --> 34:38.135
No.

34:39.101 --> 34:41.225
I think it's great.

34:47.235 --> 34:49.025
I need you to do something for me.

34:51.030 --> 34:52.822
It might be kind of hard.

34:55.284 --> 34:59.532
I wanna write letters to Rachel and Ella.

35:00.207 --> 35:02.828
I tried to do it myself...

35:03.001 --> 35:05.207
...but I can't read my own writing now.

35:12.303 --> 35:15.968
I want them to open letters
on special days.

35:17.182 --> 35:18.761
You know?

35:18.976 --> 35:22.594
High-school graduation, college...

35:23.022 --> 35:24.398
...their wedding days.

35:30.906 --> 35:33.029
Think that's cruel?

35:34.243 --> 35:38.193
Reaching out from beyond the grave
on days when they should be happy?

35:41.667 --> 35:44.621
I think they'll cherish every single word.

35:52.428 --> 35:54.255
Told you it might be hard.

35:56.933 --> 35:58.889
I'm okay.

36:22.918 --> 36:24.792
Is he asleep?

36:24.962 --> 36:26.457
Yep.

36:29.217 --> 36:30.462
He sleeps a lot now.

36:31.803 --> 36:33.297
Yeah.

36:42.105 --> 36:43.812
He's in a lot of pain.

36:45.149 --> 36:46.810
It won't be long now.

37:29.571 --> 37:31.113
Hi.

37:32.157 --> 37:33.533
Hi.

37:34.910 --> 37:37.448
I was just dreaming about you.

37:38.205 --> 37:41.657
- You were?
- When you used to love balloons.

37:43.628 --> 37:45.786
You remember how much
you loved balloons?

37:46.965 --> 37:50.713
- No.
- I used to buy them for you.

37:51.593 --> 37:54.964
And right when I handed them to you...

37:55.932 --> 37:58.055
...you'd let them go.

37:58.226 --> 38:01.097
Drive your mother crazy.

38:02.939 --> 38:05.810
Sit with me.
Sit down.

38:06.735 --> 38:08.229
Sit.

38:12.282 --> 38:15.237
I was trying to figure out...

38:15.744 --> 38:20.656
...what I should have already told you
but I never have.

38:21.334 --> 38:22.662
Something important.

38:22.835 --> 38:28.422
Something every father
should impart to his daughter.

38:30.968 --> 38:32.842
I finally got it.

38:35.348 --> 38:37.008
Generosity.

38:39.228 --> 38:42.394
Be generous...

38:43.189 --> 38:46.309
...with your time...

38:47.611 --> 38:50.398
...with your love...

38:50.823 --> 38:54.239
...with your life.

38:55.786 --> 38:57.280
Okay.

38:59.039 --> 39:01.578
I'm sorry, Rachel.

39:02.418 --> 39:06.202
- I'm so tired.
- It's okay.

39:06.714 --> 39:10.047
Don't cry for me.

39:13.805 --> 39:15.299
I won't.

39:16.266 --> 39:18.306
Be generous...

39:21.938 --> 39:23.432
...always.

39:26.151 --> 39:27.646
I will.

39:32.824 --> 39:34.319
Daddy?

39:40.165 --> 39:42.408
I remember the lullaby.

39:44.170 --> 39:46.874
I remember you used to sing it
to me every night.

40:00.395 --> 40:02.138
I remember.

40:27.798 --> 40:29.459
It's a sheep.

42:42.731 --> 42:45.898
- the resurrection and the life,
saith the Lord...

42:48.112 --> 42:51.397
- though he were dead,
yet shall he live.

42:51.574 --> 42:54.990
And whosoever liveth and believeth in me
shall never die.

42:55.911 --> 42:58.201
I know that my redeemer liveth...

42:58.373 --> 43:00.911
...and he shall stand at the latter day
upon the Earth.

43:02.084 --> 43:04.789
And though his body
be destroyed...

43:58.227 --> 43:59.804
Can I still come see Ella?

44:01.314 --> 44:04.683
Summers or at Christmas?

44:05.109 --> 44:07.813
Of course.
She's your sister.

44:15.286 --> 44:18.157
Hey! Hey, hey,
can you pull over, please?

44:18.331 --> 44:19.740
- What?
- Right here.
