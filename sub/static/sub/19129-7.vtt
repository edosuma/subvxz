00:00.934 --> 00:02.303
Previously on "The Path"...

00:02.336 --> 00:04.172
- I'm moving into the city.

00:04.205 --> 00:05.615
I don't want to talk about it.
I've already decided.

00:05.639 --> 00:07.141
It's a done thing.

00:07.175 --> 00:09.443
- I would like to invite you
to climb to 2R.

00:09.477 --> 00:11.445
- Are you serious?

00:11.479 --> 00:12.446
- I'd be humbled
to be your guide.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.215
- I just came from the auction.

00:14.248 --> 00:15.616
- What did he buy it for?
- Five.

00:15.649 --> 00:18.286
- $5 million?
- We don't have $5 million.

00:18.319 --> 00:19.653
- I need you to run this

00:19.687 --> 00:21.231
for industrial
pollutants and chemicals, okay?

00:21.255 --> 00:22.356
Bill it to the Meyers case.

00:22.390 --> 00:24.192
- Under what?
- Offset.

00:24.225 --> 00:26.260
- Can you help me
with something?

00:26.294 --> 00:28.162
Cut it off.

00:28.196 --> 00:30.064
- He must have fallen.

00:30.098 --> 00:32.700
This puts the entire
movement in jeopardy.

00:32.732 --> 00:34.535
I want you to think about Eddie.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.370
Let him walk away.

00:36.404 --> 00:38.072
I can only see his back now,

00:38.106 --> 00:39.607
where the lightning hit him.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.775
- He was struck by lightning
in Peru.

00:41.809 --> 00:45.313
- How did you know?

00:45.346 --> 00:46.680
- It was Eddie!

00:46.714 --> 00:48.416
Eddie Lane was
on the mountain with Steve.

00:48.449 --> 00:51.051
Eddie Lane.

02:00.388 --> 02:04.158
- God only knows.

02:25.346 --> 02:27.181
Summer.

02:32.220 --> 02:34.355
Summer!

02:36.390 --> 02:39.460
Stop!

02:39.493 --> 02:40.828
Stop!

02:53.674 --> 02:55.809
- Summer?

03:12.393 --> 03:15.229
No, I can't.

03:15.263 --> 03:17.331
No. I have to work.

03:17.365 --> 03:19.633
Yeah, well,
it's not all about you.

03:23.337 --> 03:24.838
This is ridiculous.

03:24.872 --> 03:29.343
I have work too, you know.

03:29.377 --> 03:31.545
All right. All right.
You know what? Fine. Fine.

03:31.579 --> 03:35.249
I will pick him up
in an hour, okay?

03:35.283 --> 03:38.252
Yes, I will be there in an hour.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.459
I...
I have to watch Johnny now,

03:45.493 --> 03:47.528
even though it's his week,

03:47.561 --> 03:50.298
and I have to be at this wedding
in the Hamptons tonight, and...

03:50.331 --> 03:51.999
- Another wedding?
- It's just a gig.

03:52.032 --> 03:54.835
It's... it's doing the hair
for the whole bridal party,

03:54.868 --> 03:57.505
and it goes all weekend,
and it's really good money,

03:57.538 --> 03:58.872
and my friend got me the job,

03:58.906 --> 04:01.642
and she's gonna fucking kill me

04:01.675 --> 04:03.944
for having to cancel
at the last minute.

04:03.977 --> 04:07.881
It's just...
fucking Benson.

04:07.915 --> 04:11.385
- Well, you know,
I... I could watch him.

04:11.419 --> 04:12.653
I mean, why not?

04:12.686 --> 04:14.955
Be fun to get
to know him a little.

04:14.988 --> 04:18.992
- Yeah, that's... that's really,
really sweet, but we...

04:19.026 --> 04:20.560
- What?
- Me and Benson sort of have

04:20.594 --> 04:22.029
this deal worked out

04:22.062 --> 04:24.665
where we have to run
that sort of thing by each other

04:24.698 --> 04:27.000
before we introduce
Johnny to a...

04:27.034 --> 04:30.771
Our new...
anyone new.

04:30.804 --> 04:33.407
- All right. I get that.

04:33.441 --> 04:37.645
But I have actually
already met Johnny,

04:37.678 --> 04:41.382
at the beach, so that rule
doesn't really apply.

04:41.415 --> 04:43.484
- Yeah, but... yeah, okay,
but you weren't

04:43.517 --> 04:45.819
my boyfriend then, technically.

04:45.853 --> 04:49.089
- Well, we don't have
to be boyfriend,

04:49.122 --> 04:51.892
girlfriend for the next
48 hours.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.894
I could just be your sitter.

04:53.927 --> 04:55.796
Come on. I'm CPR certified.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.498
He will be safe...

04:57.531 --> 05:00.368
- Are you really?
- Yes. I am a very good sitter.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.536
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.472
- Thank you so much.
- Of course.

05:04.505 --> 05:07.475
- Thank you.
- Oh, you're so sweet.

05:07.508 --> 05:10.744
Mm! Mm!

05:10.778 --> 05:12.513
You are a lifesaver.
You know that?

05:12.546 --> 05:16.417
- Yeah.
- Thank you. The best.

05:20.754 --> 05:21.955
- How long has this been here?

05:21.989 --> 05:23.591
- I called you as soon
as I saw it.

05:23.624 --> 05:25.459
- What, you didn't see
anybody put it up?

05:25.493 --> 05:27.604
- You should have stopped them.
- I stepped away for a minute.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.397
- Who knows how many people
have seen this.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.432
I was just in the bathroom
and back.

05:31.465 --> 05:32.966
Sarah?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.868
- We need to keep
this between us.

05:34.902 --> 05:37.037
- Is something wrong?

05:39.707 --> 05:43.343
Don't bother
pretending otherwise.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.763
- What have you done?

06:02.796 --> 06:05.733
- What, Sarah? What is it?

06:05.766 --> 06:07.835
- I won't let them seize
the compound.

06:12.806 --> 06:15.476
What? What are you thinking?

06:20.814 --> 06:23.684
- No, no.
- We're not losing the compound.

06:23.717 --> 06:24.985
I'd never let that happen.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.654
- You know,
I can't let them take

06:26.687 --> 06:30.658
Steve's home... the home
that he built for us.

06:30.691 --> 06:32.726
Not for your dream.

06:32.760 --> 06:36.163
- Now, we... we have to sell the...
- The center.

06:36.196 --> 06:38.799
- I don't see another way.

06:53.180 --> 06:57.718
- You know, I used to play
with G.I. Joes too.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.554
Can't believe
they're still around.

07:06.594 --> 07:08.662
Hey, what do you say
we get out of here?

07:08.696 --> 07:11.098
Huh? Go on an adventure
or something.

07:11.131 --> 07:15.135
- Too much traffic and too
many people on a Saturday.

07:15.168 --> 07:18.138
- Ah, come on.
- It's easy to make up excuses.

07:18.171 --> 07:22.109
There's got to be some place
that you want to go.

07:23.911 --> 07:25.746
It better be good.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.516
- Okay.

07:37.658 --> 07:40.994
I need your strength.

07:41.028 --> 07:44.565
Your patience.

07:48.636 --> 07:51.071
Your restraint.

07:51.104 --> 07:53.707
Be The Light.

07:53.741 --> 07:57.845
Righteous and good.

08:01.214 --> 08:02.650
Give me your strength,

08:02.683 --> 08:04.284
your patience.

08:04.317 --> 08:07.888
Righteous and good.

08:34.081 --> 08:35.115
- Hey.

08:35.148 --> 08:36.650
The hell is wrong with you, man?

08:36.683 --> 08:38.061
Are you trying to give me
a heart attack?

08:38.085 --> 08:40.888
- This was your idea.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.756
I'm the one holding
the bag of burgers

08:42.789 --> 08:44.157
in the middle of the woods.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.959
- That's right.
- What if a bear came at me?

08:45.993 --> 08:47.961
- Well, then he would be
doing you a favor.

08:47.995 --> 08:49.863
- There's seriously bears?

08:49.897 --> 08:53.601
I can't believe you had me
out here like that.

08:53.634 --> 08:55.168
Hey, you might want
to slow down there.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.838
I drank the soda on the way.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.240
- Just give me the results
for the water.

09:00.273 --> 09:02.643
- McClusky shut that down.
- What?

09:02.676 --> 09:03.911
- Yeah.
- Why?

09:03.944 --> 09:05.345
- I think Penetti's been
on his ass.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.581
They want these guys
out of commission, pronto.

09:07.615 --> 09:09.883
- That's bullshit.
- What does the water have

09:09.917 --> 09:12.152
to do with your case?
Just get Penetti something

09:12.185 --> 09:14.087
and get the fuck out of there.

09:14.121 --> 09:16.289
What are you doing, man?
What's going on with you?

09:16.323 --> 09:19.860
Seriously, your wife
is living with her mom?

09:19.893 --> 09:21.762
Just focus and finish the job.

09:21.795 --> 09:23.597
Get your promotion,

09:23.631 --> 09:25.866
deal with your real life.

09:27.668 --> 09:30.804
- Tell McClusky
I got this, okay?

09:30.838 --> 09:33.807
I got this.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.311
- It doesn't look great, I know.

09:38.345 --> 09:40.213
We were in the process
of converting

09:40.247 --> 09:41.915
some of the apartments.

09:41.949 --> 09:45.085
- Though it's unfinished,
the more open floor plan

09:45.118 --> 09:47.788
should appeal
to savvy investors.

09:47.821 --> 09:51.324
- It really affords
new possibilities on the space.

09:51.358 --> 09:53.193
- Maybe a nonprofit
would be interested.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.128
They could continue
some of the relationships

09:55.162 --> 09:56.964
we've already established
with the community.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.266
- We'd be more than happy
to help with the transition.

09:59.299 --> 10:02.369
- Yeah, there's no easy way
to say this.

10:02.402 --> 10:07.975
If you sell now, you're gonna
take a hit... a substantial one.

10:08.008 --> 10:11.311
- We understand why you would
advise us against that.

10:11.344 --> 10:14.214
- Wait three years and you might
get what you paid for it.

10:14.247 --> 10:17.785
Unfortunately, we're not
in a position to wait.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.219
Let us show you the roof garden.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.154
- Actually, Sarah,
could you go on without me?

10:21.188 --> 10:22.756
There's a call I need to make.

10:22.790 --> 10:25.058
- Of course.
- The views alone

10:25.092 --> 10:27.294
up there will sell the building.

10:27.327 --> 10:30.097
- This way.

11:00.828 --> 11:04.397
- Fuck! Ah! Fuck! Fuck!

11:35.495 --> 11:38.498
- This will work fine.

11:42.369 --> 11:45.072
- This place is insane.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.240
- You like this stuff?
- Yeah.

11:47.274 --> 11:50.077
My kids were never
really into war stuff,

11:50.110 --> 11:51.745
so I've never been here.

11:51.779 --> 11:54.882
- Me either. My dad works.

11:54.915 --> 11:57.284
But we do other fun stuff.

11:57.317 --> 11:58.819
Oh, I don't doubt it.

11:58.852 --> 12:01.121
Butkiss was a fun guy.

12:01.154 --> 12:03.791
- You know my dad?
- I do.

12:03.824 --> 12:06.059
Well, I did.

12:06.093 --> 12:07.260
Smart dude.

12:07.294 --> 12:09.963
Curious, just like you.

12:09.997 --> 12:12.800
He wouldn't like you.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.167
He wouldn't like me?

12:14.201 --> 12:16.136
Why do you say that?

12:16.169 --> 12:18.772
You're not just the babysitter.

12:18.806 --> 12:23.476
Dad wants to get back together,
but I know they're not.

12:23.510 --> 12:28.181
- Hey, all that matters is that
they both love you very much.

12:28.215 --> 12:32.419
- Yeah.
- I just always miss someone.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.922
- Yeah.

12:34.955 --> 12:37.858
Want to go
check out the special exhibit?

12:37.891 --> 12:39.860
- Yeah.
- Come on.

12:42.229 --> 12:43.563
Good choice, bud.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.265
Thanks.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.226
- Sorry, I didn't realize
you were in here.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.185
- Oh, no. Sorry.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.320
- What happened?
- Oh, it's nothing.

13:07.354 --> 13:09.890
It's fine. It's fine.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.029
It was an accident.

13:16.063 --> 13:19.132
- You don't have to tell me.

13:22.202 --> 13:25.238
Sorry.

13:29.609 --> 13:32.612
I fucked up, Mary.

13:32.645 --> 13:37.885
We're gonna lose everything.

13:37.918 --> 13:38.986
This was supposed to be...

13:39.019 --> 13:43.056
- You won't let that happen.

13:43.090 --> 13:45.959
Look at what you've already
given us.

13:45.993 --> 13:50.130
What you've given me.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.232
Faith.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.601
I never had that.

13:54.634 --> 13:57.470
A husband, Sean, who loves me.

13:57.504 --> 14:00.207
A father for my baby...
You gave that.

14:00.240 --> 14:04.577
You... you give it.

14:04.611 --> 14:07.981
You'll never let us down.

14:08.015 --> 14:11.618
You see us.

14:11.651 --> 14:15.388
- I see you.

14:17.457 --> 14:20.127
Oh, no.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.635
Oh.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.641
No, no.

14:37.244 --> 14:40.180
Sorry, sorry.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.386
There's nothing to be afraid of.

14:46.419 --> 14:49.656
Consider this offering
an act of solidarity.

14:49.689 --> 14:53.460
We're with you.
We are you.

14:53.493 --> 14:56.396
The Light says that no man
is better or worse

14:56.429 --> 14:57.998
than any other man,

14:58.031 --> 15:00.133
even though the circumstances
of their birth

15:00.167 --> 15:02.335
may try to say otherwise.

15:02.369 --> 15:03.971
The Light said,

15:04.004 --> 15:08.708
"To be closer to me,
you must humble yourself."

15:08.741 --> 15:13.413
And so we kneel before those
we assume we are better than,

15:13.446 --> 15:18.051
and we wash each other's feet
as a reminder

15:18.085 --> 15:20.620
that we are all the same.

15:20.653 --> 15:25.592
No more, no less.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.070
Why don't you get us
some fresh towels?

15:27.094 --> 15:29.529
I'll take over for you.

15:29.562 --> 15:32.699
Yeah.

15:34.767 --> 15:38.738
I'm sorry.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.340
You should come inside after.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.142
We have some boots
that might fit you better.

15:42.175 --> 15:43.643
- I have boots.
- That's fine.

15:43.676 --> 15:47.614
You can take them both.
Whatever you want.

15:47.647 --> 15:50.250
I'm Hawk.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.487
- Daniel.

15:54.521 --> 15:57.390
It's good to meet you, sir.

16:00.493 --> 16:03.396
Mom?

16:03.430 --> 16:06.599
- I didn't
recognize you at first.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.601
- Uh, yeah.
- It's different. I know.

16:08.635 --> 16:11.238
- Looks good on you.

16:11.271 --> 16:14.441
All this does.

16:14.474 --> 16:17.010
May I help?

16:17.044 --> 16:20.480
- Yeah. Yeah. Definitely.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.131
- Could you take these?

16:38.165 --> 16:40.167
Hawk.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.069
You cut your hair.

16:42.102 --> 16:46.573
- Yeah. Yeah, I wanted a change.

16:48.275 --> 16:51.144
- You were looking for me?
- Yes. Yes.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.080
I heard what you did...

16:53.113 --> 16:54.481
Your interpretation of the rung,

16:54.514 --> 16:57.117
your ability to recognize

16:57.150 --> 16:59.186
how you could
best serve those around you.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.720
It's exemplary.

17:00.753 --> 17:05.258
- Thanks.
- Everyone isn't so insightful.

17:06.659 --> 17:09.695
I see you, Hawk.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.464
You're a leader in the making.

17:11.498 --> 17:15.102
That's why I want to get
a jump on our next session.

17:15.135 --> 17:18.171
- Right now?
- Yeah. Walk with me.

17:21.241 --> 17:24.211
Mastering Servant is not
only understanding

17:24.243 --> 17:25.545
how you can be of service,

17:25.578 --> 17:27.847
but identifying the potential
in others.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.782
- Uh-huh.
- Steve saw the same gift

17:29.816 --> 17:31.784
of insight in me
when I was doing 2R.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.820
Did you ever meet Jeremiah?

17:33.853 --> 17:35.855
He and Richard were together
for a long time.

17:35.888 --> 17:39.159
- Yeah. Yeah, I think so.
- Jeremiah was this guy...

17:39.192 --> 17:41.561
Really wanted to help
whenever he could.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.330
We'd go on these
disaster missions,

17:43.363 --> 17:45.565
but the guy had allergies,
asthma,

17:45.598 --> 17:47.400
and we'd end up having
to take care of him.

17:47.434 --> 17:49.436
So one day I said to Steve,

17:49.469 --> 17:52.272
"Jeremiah's a great lawyer.
That's what he should be doing."

17:52.305 --> 17:54.607
Instead of having
an asthma attack in the field,

17:54.641 --> 17:58.578
"he should go back to work and
help us fund the work we do."

17:58.611 --> 18:01.214
- Was he upset?
- Uh, for a moment,

18:01.248 --> 18:03.550
but, you know, once he wrote
the first check,

18:03.583 --> 18:07.620
he got that high that you can
only get from truly serving.

18:07.654 --> 18:12.592
The joy in exercising
what you have to give.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.694
- Where's Jeremiah now?

18:14.727 --> 18:17.564
- That's another story
for another time.

18:17.597 --> 18:21.701
Here, now, I want you to keep
an eye on your peers,

18:21.734 --> 18:24.471
identify their
individual potential,

18:24.504 --> 18:27.840
and... and, uh,
you know, help them see it.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.409
Help them realize it.

18:29.442 --> 18:32.445
Like your friend, Noa.

18:34.881 --> 18:38.218
How bad is it?

18:38.251 --> 18:40.653
Oh.

18:40.687 --> 18:42.289
It took us years to rebuild

18:42.322 --> 18:44.191
Steve's family farm
into the place.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.302
- Then what about our homes?
- They're on the compound.

18:46.326 --> 18:47.894
Does that mean
they take our homes too?

18:47.927 --> 18:49.405
If we sell the New York
City building,

18:49.429 --> 18:50.830
we can pay back the taxes.

18:50.863 --> 18:53.700
- What do you mean "if"?
- You can't be wavering.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.302
- When. When we sell...

18:55.335 --> 18:56.936
- Will selling it
even be enough money?

18:56.969 --> 18:59.772
- We all know he overpaid.
- And what about the garden?

18:59.806 --> 19:03.243
What if this is where the garden
is meant to be and we lose it?

19:03.276 --> 19:04.444
The Light has a plan.

19:04.477 --> 19:05.754
We just need to open
ourselves to it.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.280
- But you own your house.

19:07.314 --> 19:09.482
- We have five kids... five kids.
- Nicole...

19:09.516 --> 19:10.793
- What else do we know
how to do?

19:10.817 --> 19:12.252
You don't know
how to do anything.

19:12.285 --> 19:13.820
What are you gonna do?
Bag groceries?

19:13.853 --> 19:16.923
- How did this happen?
- Well, it's not my fault, Dad.

19:16.956 --> 19:18.534
- I wasn't blaming you.
- You were looking at me

19:18.558 --> 19:19.902
- when you said that.
- I wasn't blaming you.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.461
- Sarah's in charge,
and I get blamed.

19:21.494 --> 19:22.705
- Your dad's going
through something.

19:22.729 --> 19:25.765
- What does that mean?
- Stop it. Stop.

19:25.798 --> 19:27.934
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, honey.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.536
It's okay.
Everything's fine.

19:29.569 --> 19:32.339
You can go back and play.

19:33.640 --> 19:36.543
Everything will be okay.
I promise.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.411
And I take responsibility.

19:38.445 --> 19:41.214
I do. But I need your support.

19:41.248 --> 19:44.717
You know, if this gets out,
people will panic,

19:44.751 --> 19:48.355
and I need everybody
to remain calm

19:48.388 --> 19:51.591
while we get through this, okay?

19:51.624 --> 19:55.828
The Light has a plan.
If we open ourselves to it...

19:55.862 --> 19:58.231
We become part of its map.

19:58.265 --> 20:01.334
Our fates intertwined
with its providence,

20:01.368 --> 20:03.970
so no matter which
direction we walk in,

20:04.003 --> 20:07.874
The Light will point us home.

20:07.907 --> 20:10.943
Whoa. How cool is this?

20:10.977 --> 20:12.479
- Did you know this ship
also fought

20:12.512 --> 20:14.947
in World War II
and against Russia?

20:14.981 --> 20:17.384
I did not.
How'd you know that?

20:17.417 --> 20:18.918
Uh, I live in the world.

20:18.951 --> 20:21.854
- Easy, wiseass.
- Hey, check this one out.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.457
- Wow. Great.

20:24.491 --> 20:25.758
- What happened?

20:25.792 --> 20:27.494
Why are they running like that?

20:27.527 --> 20:30.497
We shall fight the battle
for social construction,

20:30.530 --> 20:31.698
and throughout the world..

20:31.731 --> 20:35.568
- Let's, uh, let's go this way.

20:35.602 --> 20:38.638
Eddie?
Hey, are you okay?

20:38.671 --> 20:40.873
- Yeah, no, I'm fine.

20:45.645 --> 20:49.582
We shall fight
the battle against aggression

20:49.616 --> 20:50.917
in Vietnam.

20:56.022 --> 20:59.392
And we shall prevail.

21:55.482 --> 21:57.884
- Hey. Got your text.

22:04.591 --> 22:06.993
Um, hey, I lost my phone.

22:07.026 --> 22:09.829
Is there any way
that I can use yours?

22:12.432 --> 22:14.501
Thanks.

22:27.580 --> 22:30.817
Hey, Mom.

22:30.850 --> 22:34.053
Yeah, yeah, hi.

22:34.086 --> 22:35.688
Oh, I know.
I know, it's, um...

22:35.722 --> 22:38.791
It's been a while.

22:38.825 --> 22:42.161
Yeah, no, everything's great.

22:42.194 --> 22:45.898
Mary is great.

22:45.932 --> 22:48.668
No. No, no, no.
I'm... I'm fine.

22:48.701 --> 22:52.639
I just... you know, really.

22:54.507 --> 22:58.978
Yeah, I miss you too.

22:59.011 --> 23:00.980
Ah, you know,
I got to go in a minute.

23:01.013 --> 23:03.983
I just, um, I, uh,

23:04.016 --> 23:08.187
I wanted to let you know
that we're having a baby.

23:08.220 --> 23:12.091
Yeah.

23:12.124 --> 23:14.494
Yeah, and I don't know...

23:14.527 --> 23:16.028
I'm a little scared, you know,

23:16.062 --> 23:18.498
'cause I don't know
how it's gonna be,

23:18.531 --> 23:21.000
and, um... no.

23:21.033 --> 23:22.702
No, Mom, I'm not... that's...

23:22.735 --> 23:25.872
No, that's not what
I'm saying, I'm...

23:25.905 --> 23:27.707
No, Mom, that's... no, please.

23:27.740 --> 23:31.478
Don't come, okay?
Just don't come. I'm fine.

23:31.511 --> 23:32.979
I just... I wanted...

23:33.012 --> 23:36.449
I wanted just
to tell you, you know?

23:36.483 --> 23:41.187
Okay. Just don't come, okay?

23:49.195 --> 23:52.632
Fill this space with light.

23:52.665 --> 23:54.967
Let it be healed.

23:55.001 --> 23:59.572
Find....

23:59.606 --> 24:01.107
And we may find

24:01.140 --> 24:03.510
always the truth in The Light...

24:12.151 --> 24:15.788
Where's Eddie?

24:15.822 --> 24:18.791
- It wasn't the right time.
- But we need him!

24:18.825 --> 24:20.527
We're so close to knowing
what happened.

24:20.560 --> 24:24.130
- It wasn't right!

24:24.163 --> 24:28.501
It's taken me years
to feel clean...

24:28.535 --> 24:32.238
To accept The Light's
forgiveness.

24:32.271 --> 24:36.108
I nearly forfeited
that for this.

24:36.142 --> 24:39.078
I've been acting out
of anger, rage.

24:39.111 --> 24:43.750
- You've been acting out
of loyalty to Steve.

24:43.783 --> 24:45.284
Don't lose sight of that.

24:45.317 --> 24:49.822
- Following Eddie led me
back there.

24:49.856 --> 24:52.191
To the war.

24:52.224 --> 24:54.894
The men whose lives I took.

24:54.927 --> 24:56.629
That was no coincidence.

24:56.663 --> 24:59.532
I was made to see that.

25:03.335 --> 25:07.173
I am no longer the man
who committed those atrocities.

25:07.206 --> 25:10.076
- It was Steve who
helped you see that.

25:10.109 --> 25:13.646
- There was a child with him.

25:13.680 --> 25:17.083
A little boy.

25:17.116 --> 25:20.987
- It wasn't the right time.

25:21.020 --> 25:24.991
I trust in your judgment,
just as Steve did.

25:27.727 --> 25:31.864
We need to try again.

25:34.801 --> 25:36.102
- I don't know if I can.

25:36.135 --> 25:40.006
- We owe it to Steve.

25:40.039 --> 25:43.042
He'll see us through this.

25:58.658 --> 26:01.227
- You space out a lot.

26:01.260 --> 26:04.897
- Uh, no, I, um...

26:04.931 --> 26:06.198
is this all right?

26:06.232 --> 26:08.968
- I hate bananas.
- You hate bananas?

26:09.001 --> 26:12.204
Look, I just got
to make some more.

26:14.006 --> 26:19.245
Look... Johnny, you know I'm not

26:19.278 --> 26:22.615
trying to be your dad, right?

26:22.649 --> 26:24.159
Because, you know,
if anyone was trying

26:24.183 --> 26:28.921
to do that with my kids,

26:28.955 --> 26:30.690
I would not be okay with it.

26:30.723 --> 26:34.794
- But you like my mom.
- Yes, I do.

26:34.827 --> 26:39.265
- Then my dad will never like
you, so I can't like you.

26:39.298 --> 26:43.736
Maybe stop trying
to make me like you.

26:43.770 --> 26:47.073
- Fair enough.

26:47.106 --> 26:50.009
- What happened to the kids
in that picture?

26:50.042 --> 26:52.645
- Picture?

26:52.679 --> 26:55.347
Oh, from the, um, the exhibit?

26:55.381 --> 27:00.286
Ah, well, it was in a war,
and they were very scared.

27:00.319 --> 27:03.155
- Did they die?

27:03.189 --> 27:05.091
- It was a very long
time ago, Johnny.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.993
- Can that happen here?
- No.

27:07.026 --> 27:08.861
- But if it did,
what would you do?

27:08.895 --> 27:12.999
- It's not gonna happen here.
- But if it did.

27:13.032 --> 27:17.737
- I would go home as fast
as I could

27:17.770 --> 27:19.739
and try to protect my family.

27:19.772 --> 27:22.174
- You'd leave me?
- No. If you...

27:22.208 --> 27:25.244
If you were with me, I would...

27:25.277 --> 27:27.980
I would take you with me.

27:28.014 --> 27:30.116
- That's not that the man said.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.818
- The man?

27:31.851 --> 27:35.121
- The one who was following us.

27:35.154 --> 27:38.224
- There was a man following us?

27:38.257 --> 27:40.092
Where? At the museum?

27:40.126 --> 27:41.436
- He asked if I knew
how to get home,

27:41.460 --> 27:45.397
because he wanted you
to go with him.

27:58.811 --> 28:03.115
- I've been looking over
our finances.

28:03.149 --> 28:05.284
And praying.

28:07.353 --> 28:09.956
We're fucked no matter
what we do.

28:09.989 --> 28:12.725
We owe hundreds of thousands
of dollars in taxes.

28:12.759 --> 28:17.163
You know, I own my own home,
but I'm one of the few.

28:17.196 --> 28:18.965
You know, Eddie wanted us
to own something...

28:18.998 --> 28:23.035
Something that was just ours.

28:23.069 --> 28:25.471
I'm gonna try to take a second
mortgage out on the house.

28:25.504 --> 28:27.206
It won't be everything
that we need,

28:27.239 --> 28:29.275
but it could show
a sign of good faith

28:29.308 --> 28:33.212
while we ask others
to sacrifice.

28:33.245 --> 28:38.217
- What about this place?
- We try to keep it.

28:38.250 --> 28:41.788
- Sarah, why?
- For the movement.

28:41.821 --> 28:44.356
For the future.

28:44.390 --> 28:47.093
And for my son.

28:49.896 --> 28:52.331
- You seen Noa?

28:52.364 --> 28:55.167
Thank you.

28:59.005 --> 29:00.506
I was looking for you.

29:00.539 --> 29:02.942
- Found me.

29:05.177 --> 29:09.015
Hey, check it out.

29:09.048 --> 29:10.993
Have you ever thought about
how much has to come together

29:11.017 --> 29:12.985
for anything to grow?

29:13.019 --> 29:14.120
Or live, even.

29:14.153 --> 29:15.554
- Smoked out since junior high,

29:15.587 --> 29:17.890
so I've probably thought
about it once or twice.

29:17.924 --> 29:19.959
- Right.
- It's just... it's crazy how

29:19.992 --> 29:23.095
if something doesn't
do its thing,

29:23.129 --> 29:25.431
doesn't do everything it can do,

29:25.464 --> 29:28.334
we lose out on just
how good it can all be.

29:28.367 --> 29:31.337
- Okay. Guess that's true.

29:31.370 --> 29:33.105
That's why you were
looking for me?

29:33.139 --> 29:37.243
- No. Yeah.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.445
In a way.

29:39.478 --> 29:41.489
I don't think you're living up
to your full potential.

29:41.513 --> 29:43.515
- What?
- I don't think

29:43.549 --> 29:47.153
you're doing everything
you can for the movement.

29:47.186 --> 29:50.222
I know you and your mom don't
have the easiest relationship,

29:50.256 --> 29:52.992
- but I think if you...
- Stop. Stop it.

29:53.025 --> 29:56.128
- I mean, denying where you come
from and who you are

29:56.162 --> 29:58.931
and all the good that money
could do for so many people.

29:58.965 --> 30:00.166
- Don't do this, Hawk.

30:00.199 --> 30:01.509
- But you say you want
to help people.

30:01.533 --> 30:04.070
This is how you can make
the greatest impact.

30:04.103 --> 30:06.372
- Did your mom ever
leave you stranded

30:06.405 --> 30:08.507
at a friend's birthday party
for hours

30:08.540 --> 30:10.509
after everyone else
had gone home?

30:10.542 --> 30:12.444
Your friends' parents
just staring at you,

30:12.478 --> 30:14.080
not knowing what to do with you

30:14.113 --> 30:18.550
except never invite you
back, obviously.

30:18.584 --> 30:21.153
When she finally did show up,
she'd be stoned,

30:21.187 --> 30:23.389
just completely out of her mind,
and she's say

30:23.422 --> 30:26.893
how sorry she was
and that she'd make it up to me,

30:26.926 --> 30:28.127
and I let her.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.196
I let her buy my forgiveness,

30:30.229 --> 30:33.565
buy me, over and over.

30:33.599 --> 30:36.035
How fucked up is that?

30:36.068 --> 30:39.038
- It's, uh... it's fucked up.

30:39.071 --> 30:42.374
She is. She's...

30:42.408 --> 30:45.177
- That woman's been
on so many pills for so long,

30:45.211 --> 30:47.546
I'm shocked she doesn't just

30:47.579 --> 30:51.217
disintegrate in the rain.

30:51.250 --> 30:55.955
- I don't think it rains
much in L.A.

30:55.988 --> 30:59.591
- I'm never asking her
for anything ever again, Hawk.

30:59.625 --> 31:02.528
She's toxic.

31:12.438 --> 31:14.240
Are these all of
your housing costs?

31:14.273 --> 31:15.975
Utilities, property taxes...

31:16.008 --> 31:18.477
Yes. All accounted for.

31:18.510 --> 31:21.513
- I see you bring
in $20,000 a year, Mr. Lane.

31:21.547 --> 31:24.216
- Oh, no, sorry.
- I'm not Mr. Lane.

31:24.250 --> 31:25.517
- He's my business partner.

31:25.551 --> 31:28.054
- Cal Roberts.

31:28.087 --> 31:29.421
- Where's Mr. Lane?

31:29.455 --> 31:31.223
He is the co-owner of the house.

31:31.257 --> 31:34.293
- We're in the process of him
signing it over to me.

31:34.326 --> 31:37.229
We're estranged.

31:37.263 --> 31:38.931
- Your earnings...
- They appear

31:38.965 --> 31:40.933
to fluctuate
every quarter or so?

31:40.967 --> 31:42.601
- The movement pays my salary,

31:42.634 --> 31:45.471
and since our primary
income is based on donations,

31:45.504 --> 31:46.939
my take-home can vary.

31:46.973 --> 31:48.316
- But you'll see
in that earnings report

31:48.340 --> 31:49.508
that most of our followers

31:49.541 --> 31:50.986
are part of the monthly
giving program,

31:51.010 --> 31:52.144
so that's a steady stream...

31:52.178 --> 31:56.082
- Which they can quit
at any time?

31:56.115 --> 31:59.018
- They won't do that.

31:59.051 --> 32:01.687
- There's no stable cash flow
for monthly repayments.

32:01.720 --> 32:03.455
There's never been any problem.

32:03.489 --> 32:06.225
I've always made
my mortgage payments on time.

32:06.258 --> 32:09.495
- While you were
a two-income household.

32:12.531 --> 32:14.033
Is your home's last appraiser

32:14.066 --> 32:16.235
considered a disciple
of your religion?

32:16.268 --> 32:19.205
What... what does the faith
of the appraiser

32:19.238 --> 32:20.973
have to do with anything?

32:21.007 --> 32:22.441
- Maybe a conflict of interest,

32:22.474 --> 32:25.177
given your urgent need
for this loan.

32:25.211 --> 32:26.645
But it is extraneous.

32:26.678 --> 32:28.614
The truth is, trying to add debt

32:28.647 --> 32:30.316
on top of accumulating losses

32:30.349 --> 32:33.685
is a step toward bankruptcy.

32:42.294 --> 32:45.397
- She hates surprises.
- That's all I'm saying.

32:45.431 --> 32:48.367
- Here, put this in
the car for me.

33:01.547 --> 33:03.149
Hey, Eddie, is everything okay?

33:03.182 --> 33:05.417
- Better than...
- We're, uh...

33:05.451 --> 33:06.652
We're coming to see you.

33:06.685 --> 33:08.720
What? Eddie, no.

33:08.754 --> 33:10.289
The wedding's in a couple hours,

33:10.322 --> 33:12.024
and I'm coming right home
after that.

33:12.058 --> 33:15.061
Yeah, well, you know,
we thought it'd be fun...

33:15.094 --> 33:16.395
Hang out at the beach all day...

33:16.428 --> 33:18.397
Until you're done.

33:18.430 --> 33:20.366
Then we can road trip
back together.

33:20.399 --> 33:22.668
Eddie, are you sure
that everything's okay?

33:22.701 --> 33:26.372
Eddie, I'm sorry,
I just... this is so sweet of you,

33:26.405 --> 33:28.374
and I'm just really tired

33:28.407 --> 33:30.542
and these girls
are really insane,

33:30.576 --> 33:32.644
and I just... look,

33:32.678 --> 33:34.756
I can't thank you enough
for what you're doing for me,

33:34.780 --> 33:39.351
and now this, and I just love...

33:39.385 --> 33:42.521
what you're doing for me,
and, um,

33:42.554 --> 33:44.190
it really means a lot to me.

33:44.223 --> 33:47.293
- Yeah. Yeah.
- And I can't wait to see you.

33:47.326 --> 33:49.428
Okay. You too.

33:49.461 --> 33:53.232
- Bye.

33:53.265 --> 33:56.368
Come on. Get in the car.

34:08.447 --> 34:10.149
- I tried.

34:10.181 --> 34:13.752
I know.

34:13.784 --> 34:17.489
- We can't save it.

34:17.523 --> 34:20.292
We're supposed to be leaders

34:20.326 --> 34:22.628
and protectors of this movement.

34:22.661 --> 34:25.630
- Co-guardians of The Light.

34:25.664 --> 34:28.367
- And we are really
fucking this up.

34:33.505 --> 34:36.375
I mean...

34:37.909 --> 34:40.512
Oh, God.

34:45.451 --> 34:51.157
- Sarah...
- You moved me.

34:51.190 --> 34:55.893
Since I was a kid,
I grew up with everything,

34:55.927 --> 34:59.765
and you were this boy
who came from hell

34:59.798 --> 35:03.869
and could find The Light
and still bring it to others.

35:03.902 --> 35:07.173
You were exceptional.

35:10.276 --> 35:14.280
I also knew there were things
that you weren't capable of.

35:15.947 --> 35:19.285
But that was the sacrifice,
the choice you had to make,

35:19.318 --> 35:22.454
so you could bring
the word to others.

35:22.488 --> 35:24.590
I know that you're
acting in contrition

35:24.623 --> 35:26.892
for what you did...

35:30.529 --> 35:33.599
But we need to start over.

35:33.632 --> 35:36.702
We need to do things right.

35:39.838 --> 35:43.775
I need you to be
exceptional again.

36:06.332 --> 36:08.300
- Ah.

36:09.435 --> 36:12.804
Damn it!

36:14.873 --> 36:15.941
- Hey.

36:15.974 --> 36:18.244
- Hey.
- You all right?

36:18.277 --> 36:21.313
- Yeah, I'm just being
clumsy today.

36:21.347 --> 36:23.482
That's all.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.784
- My oven's on the fritz.

36:25.817 --> 36:29.888
Frankly, I needed to
get away from them.

36:29.921 --> 36:33.659
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

36:33.692 --> 36:35.961
- Nicole, come on, what is it?

36:35.994 --> 36:40.299
What's going on?

36:40.332 --> 36:41.500
- Between us?

36:41.533 --> 36:43.669
- Yeah, of course.

36:45.871 --> 36:48.440
- Cal and Sarah
got us in serious debt.

36:48.474 --> 36:51.277
Bank put a lien on the compound.

36:51.310 --> 36:54.346
- This compound? Oh.

36:54.380 --> 36:55.790
- Oh, god, now
I've got you freaked out too.

36:55.814 --> 36:57.516
I can never keep
my big mouth shut.

36:57.549 --> 36:59.318
- No. No, no, no. Listen.

36:59.351 --> 37:01.587
Are you sure it's that serious?

37:01.620 --> 37:02.821
- Hey.
- I didn't mean...

37:02.854 --> 37:04.356
I didn't want to worry you.

37:04.390 --> 37:07.726
- Hey.

37:07.759 --> 37:09.628
They can repossess
this compound,

37:09.661 --> 37:13.599
but they can't repossess
our faith, right?

37:21.440 --> 37:24.776
- Be well, Sam.

37:44.930 --> 37:48.734
- I tried.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.769
With Noa, to get her to see,

37:50.802 --> 37:53.539
but she wasn't ready to hear it.

37:53.572 --> 37:54.906
She won't ask her mom for money.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.909
- It's okay.

37:57.943 --> 38:01.747
We all fail sometimes.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.555
Sorry, was there something else?

38:09.588 --> 38:12.824
- Noa told me about her... about
how she'd abandoned her

38:12.858 --> 38:15.894
as a kid, leave her to fend
for herself all the time.

38:15.927 --> 38:20.098
Once she told me
how awful she was, I knew.

38:20.131 --> 38:23.869
We don't need to help
Noa live up to her potential.

38:23.902 --> 38:27.739
We need to help her mother.

38:27.773 --> 38:30.776
She needs The Light.

38:48.026 --> 38:51.530
- No, I don't need a ride,
thank you.

39:11.450 --> 39:13.485
What? What are you doing here?

39:13.519 --> 39:14.796
- I need you get
in the car, sweetheart.

39:14.820 --> 39:16.755
- No, Mom, look, I...

39:16.788 --> 39:18.724
Mom, I can't do that, okay?

39:18.757 --> 39:22.661
- Sean, listen to your mother.

39:27.699 --> 39:29.701
- Sean, my name
is Wendy Kennair.

39:29.735 --> 39:31.437
She's gonna help you, Sean.

39:31.470 --> 39:33.439
You, Mary, and our grandchild.

39:33.472 --> 39:35.574
You're getting out.

39:58.897 --> 40:02.968
I got it.

40:03.001 --> 40:04.002
Can I come in?

40:04.035 --> 40:05.203
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

40:05.236 --> 40:06.838
We're just about to have lunch.

40:06.872 --> 40:08.974
Hey. Look who it is.

40:09.007 --> 40:14.112
Hey, Cal.
What are you doing here?

40:14.145 --> 40:19.084
I, uh, I wanted to
apologize to all of you

40:19.117 --> 40:23.722
for buying that building
with funds we didn't have.

40:25.857 --> 40:28.827
I know it's not been easy
with Steve gone.

40:28.860 --> 40:32.731
He was... he was our father,

40:32.764 --> 40:36.535
and our leader, our friend,

40:36.568 --> 40:38.670
and I wanted to bring the same

40:38.704 --> 40:40.939
and more,

40:40.972 --> 40:43.809
and I failed.

40:43.842 --> 40:46.778
But...

40:46.812 --> 40:50.882
I would like to try again.

40:50.916 --> 40:54.853
I'm gonna do everything
I can to fix this,

40:54.886 --> 40:58.624
to get us out of debt,

40:58.657 --> 41:03.895
and you will not suffer.

41:03.929 --> 41:06.131
I promise you that.

41:06.164 --> 41:07.933
- Thanks, Cal.

41:07.966 --> 41:12.904
And whatever you need,
you know, we're here for you.

41:12.938 --> 41:15.774
Join us. Sit.
Sit, sit, sit.

41:15.807 --> 41:18.243
- Yeah. Come on.
- Here, sweetie. Here.

41:18.276 --> 41:21.580
- You sure?
- Okay, come on, kids!

41:21.613 --> 41:23.949
Food's on.

41:23.982 --> 41:25.951
- You're welcome.

41:25.984 --> 41:27.519
- Hey.

41:27.553 --> 41:29.821
- This has been
a difficult time.

41:29.855 --> 41:32.858
There's no denying that.
It could be better.

41:32.891 --> 41:34.259
But it could be worse.

41:34.292 --> 41:36.261
- Not your most
uplifting speech.

41:36.294 --> 41:38.296
- Have a little faith, Nicole.

41:38.329 --> 41:41.032
If not for your sake, then ours.

41:41.066 --> 41:44.570
There's no room for doubt.

41:55.346 --> 41:59.050
- We're grateful for this day,

41:59.084 --> 42:01.252
for its blessings,

42:01.286 --> 42:05.624
and for the hardships
testing our resolve,

42:05.657 --> 42:09.227
hardships that will prove us
to be worthy recipients

42:09.260 --> 42:11.763
and messengers of The Light.

42:11.797 --> 42:13.799
We ask for the strength

42:13.832 --> 42:16.802
to see us through bouts
of uncertainty,

42:16.835 --> 42:18.837
to forgive our transgressions,

42:18.870 --> 42:21.072
and those of others.

42:21.106 --> 42:26.612
If we live in The Light,
it will always show us the way.

42:26.645 --> 42:29.981
The Light will provide.

42:34.252 --> 42:36.888
- You tired, bud?
- Yeah.

42:36.922 --> 42:38.356
- Why don't you take a nap?

42:38.389 --> 42:40.201
We still have at least an hour
till we get there.

42:40.225 --> 42:43.161
- Okay.

43:18.229 --> 43:21.332
- Hey, you stay here.
- I'll be right back, all right?

43:35.246 --> 43:38.183
Hey, you all right?
You need a jump?

43:38.216 --> 43:41.086
I've got some cables in the car.

43:43.121 --> 43:45.423
Richard.
Hey, what are you...

44:09.915 --> 44:11.783
I lost control.

44:11.817 --> 44:14.953
I didn't mean to hit her,
but she just wouldn't stop.

44:14.986 --> 44:19.024
He made me touch him.
I didn't want to.

44:19.057 --> 44:23.228
Losing him... I'm going
through the unimaginable.

44:23.261 --> 44:24.362
No one would believe me.

44:24.395 --> 44:25.897
That's what he told me.

44:25.931 --> 44:30.001
He just kept saying it over
and over again.

44:30.035 --> 44:32.470
First time, I thought
I was gonna die,

44:32.503 --> 44:36.875
but the time after that, it felt
like... like I came to life.

44:36.908 --> 44:40.478
I had these tactics

44:40.511 --> 44:43.081
I would use.

44:43.114 --> 44:45.050
First money, then candy.

44:45.083 --> 44:47.185
When that stopped working,

44:47.218 --> 44:50.021
alcohol and drugs.

45:26.057 --> 45:29.194
- The Light provides.

45:54.519 --> 45:57.488
Eddie?

45:57.522 --> 46:00.158
Eddie?

46:00.191 --> 46:02.460
Where'd you go?
Eddie?
