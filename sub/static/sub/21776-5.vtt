to take you as a wife.

00:20.440 --> 00:24.120

11:29.440 --> 11:31.520
Tracey, please just put your clothes on.
Please.

11:31.600 --> 11:32.600
[doorbell rings]

11:37.320 --> 11:40.240
I bought you liqueurs.
And I forgive you, so...

11:40.320 --> 11:41.920
-What you doing here?
-Dinner!

11:42.000 --> 11:44.560
Well, we love each other,
you're gonna be with me till you die,

11:44.640 --> 11:46.320
so let's tell your mum now, innit?

11:47.320 --> 11:49.840
Come on,
it's not like you're ashamed of me.

11:50.200 --> 11:52.000
Oh, my God.

11:55.440 --> 11:56.800
[clears throat]

11:57.080 --> 12:00.640
Nice to meet you, Aunty.
I got you chocolates.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.880
Evening. Seen you around, obviously.

12:09.120 --> 12:10.480
I'm Connor.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.600
I'm lactose intolerant.

12:14.520 --> 12:17.800
-I know you.
-Sh-shut up and just eat the chocolates!

12:18.880 --> 12:20.360
-Who's that?
-I'm family.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.040
-Oh, now you're family, yeah?
-What's that?

12:22.120 --> 12:24.760
Nothing, it's Boy Tracey,
remember I told you, my cousin?

12:24.840 --> 12:26.040
Yeah, she told me all about you.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.880
Great. Auntie, shall we say grace?

12:28.960 --> 12:30.280
Er...

12:30.680 --> 12:34.800
I'm so sorry. It's never like this.
You should go, I'll save you food.

12:35.080 --> 12:39.160
Thank you, Lord, for your son,
who died for our sins.

12:39.840 --> 12:42.160
All we need is
the love of a saviour,

12:42.320 --> 12:44.960
in addition to financial prosperity.

12:45.640 --> 12:50.440
We hold down Lloyds TSB,
Santander and demand them

12:50.520 --> 12:53.000
to share out the cash monies.

12:53.840 --> 12:58.360
Send Northern Rock to the south,
not west, to the east!

12:58.480 --> 13:00.400
Lift up the borrower and...

13:00.480 --> 13:03.160
-[Cynthia gasping]
-My dear.

13:03.240 --> 13:06.080
I think the lack of familiarity
of people around the table

13:06.160 --> 13:07.720
is triggering negative emotions.

13:07.800 --> 13:10.040
Cynthia, don't frighten others.

13:10.240 --> 13:11.720
How many times have I told you?

13:11.880 --> 13:14.200
It's all right, I'm fine. I'm fine.

13:14.800 --> 13:17.720
You are fine. That's good for you.

13:18.520 --> 13:22.240
Listen. The world is welcome at my table,

13:22.640 --> 13:25.280
as Christ himself welcomes the world.

13:25.680 --> 13:30.200
But who are you... and what on earth
are you doing in my house?

13:33.520 --> 13:37.120
-I'm Tracey's boyfriend--
-Ah, ah, ah! Mummy.

13:38.640 --> 13:42.480
Mummy, I was at Candice's, you know,
that sinner girl from the big block?

13:43.040 --> 13:46.480
And, uh, I saw Connor in-in the dark.

13:46.640 --> 13:48.800
Connor, would you say
it was-it was quite dark?

13:48.880 --> 13:51.960
-It was a house party, so...
-He needed the light.

13:52.040 --> 13:55.720
-Hm. John one, verse five.
-[snickering] Serious--

13:55.800 --> 13:57.720
I have since then...

13:58.440 --> 14:00.440
been showing him...

14:01.320 --> 14:04.400
what the greatest love of all is.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.120
Tracey, man, Jesus.

14:06.240 --> 14:09.400
Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. [giggling]

14:10.600 --> 14:13.480
The greatest love of all, Mummy.

14:14.240 --> 14:15.800
Welcome.

14:17.160 --> 14:18.440
This is gonna be fun.

14:24.800 --> 14:27.080
I've encountered all sorts of darkness.

14:27.240 --> 14:31.000
Single mothers, football fans,
contemporary dancers,

14:31.520 --> 14:33.040
the mentally disturbed.

14:33.560 --> 14:35.800
I used to be in a mental home, actually.

14:35.960 --> 14:39.520
I was on weed from young.
I got very bad paranoia.

14:39.600 --> 14:40.600
Are you serious?

14:40.680 --> 14:43.720
No, no, no judgment.
Paranoia, you say?

14:44.160 --> 14:47.800
Yeah, I got better than that.
I started counseling people in there.

14:47.880 --> 14:49.080
Unofficial, like.

14:49.560 --> 14:51.600
Thank God for freedom from addiction.

14:51.720 --> 14:54.280
I'm still addicted, just not paranoid.

14:54.800 --> 14:57.600
I am gluten free. Mmm.

14:58.400 --> 15:01.080
Easy with those. They're a bit boozy.

15:01.160 --> 15:04.600
Don't talk to me
like I'm some autistic toddler.

15:04.680 --> 15:08.120
Or... or I'll get my boyfriend
to curse you.

15:08.760 --> 15:11.720
That's right, Tracey,
I have a boyfriend.

15:11.840 --> 15:14.200
She absolutely does not have a boyfriend.

15:14.440 --> 15:16.920
That is amazing, I'm-I'm really happy.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.280
[imitating]
Every thing's about Tracey.

15:20.760 --> 15:22.840
Every thing's about Tracey.

15:23.240 --> 15:25.360
Leaving! Stranger danger!

15:28.280 --> 15:32.200
They don't believe me. [giggling]

15:32.920 --> 15:36.760
Yes, I have great respect
and admiration for you too.

15:37.680 --> 15:40.880
Goodbye. Bye. Dropped the phone.

15:41.240 --> 15:42.600
Dropped the phone.

15:44.560 --> 15:47.280
A poet. And what do you like
to write about?

15:47.880 --> 15:49.120
Ah. [exhales]

15:49.480 --> 15:53.080
Everything, really.
Two-dimensional shapes,

15:53.160 --> 15:57.400
um, cows, obviously, patterns,
three-dimensional shapes,

15:57.480 --> 16:00.000
-Uh-huh.
-love, I'm not gonna lie.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.240
Connor, what's your sexual history?

16:02.480 --> 16:05.120
That's a really inappropriate thing to--
-No, no, no, no shame.

16:05.200 --> 16:08.840
Often, the more sinful your past,
the more special you will be.

16:08.920 --> 16:11.600
Unless you're not serious
about your relationship with Trace--

16:11.720 --> 16:16.240
[yells] What time is it?

16:16.320 --> 16:18.480
Time for a poem, I think.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.440
Connor, heard you gave your
strongest performance last night.

16:22.520 --> 16:24.600
Heard you had a great crowd reaction.

16:24.680 --> 16:26.320
You're definitely
talking in riddles now, bruv.

16:26.400 --> 16:27.400
You got something to say, say it.

16:27.480 --> 16:29.000
I ain't your brother, and I dare you.

16:29.080 --> 16:31.440
I remembered. I remembered.
I remembered.

16:31.520 --> 16:34.680
His face was underneath your vagina,
so I couldn't see it,

16:34.760 --> 16:37.440
but he's wearing the same shoes.

16:43.480 --> 16:46.080
[Cynthia] Solved that one.
I beg your pardon.

16:46.240 --> 16:48.240
Why is Connor here?

16:48.360 --> 16:50.080
To get to know you.

16:50.640 --> 16:52.280
Ah, OK, you are?

16:53.520 --> 16:57.240
I'm Connor, we met earlier.
You didn't tell me she was ill.

16:58.160 --> 17:01.320
I'm Connor. Tracey's man.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.000
Her waste man.

17:03.160 --> 17:04.640
I swear down,
if you didn't look so much like her,

17:04.720 --> 17:06.600
I'd smash your face in, you fucking prick!

17:07.200 --> 17:10.440
There's dignity in the milk of this cow.
You are pumping me dry, Trace.

17:10.520 --> 17:12.600
-Is that supposed to be poetic?
-[Cynthia] It doesn't even rhyme.

17:12.680 --> 17:14.600
-I'm sorry.
-Hurry up and dump this idiot.

17:14.680 --> 17:17.000
-[Connor and Tracey together] What?
-He's even intoxicated your sister

17:17.080 --> 17:18.440
-Connor, no.
-with alcoholic chocolates.

17:18.560 --> 17:20.440
Get rid of him before he does any
more damage.

17:20.560 --> 17:22.920
What's he talking about?
What's he mean, "dump him"?

17:23.000 --> 17:25.600
-Cynthia, are you OK?
-[mocking] Are you OK, oh, are you OK?

17:25.680 --> 17:29.000
Oh, I'm Tracey. Oh, look at me,

17:29.080 --> 17:32.240
my crisis in faith amidst the dark
and confusing world.

17:32.320 --> 17:36.680
[gagging] Penis in my mouth.
I put it in my mouth. I take it back out.

17:36.760 --> 17:38.960
Learned my lesson, overcame,
now I'm stronger.

17:39.040 --> 17:40.720
Well, guess-guess what? Guess what?

17:41.520 --> 17:42.640
I'm engaged.

17:42.800 --> 17:45.800
Cynthia, you're gonna be fine, OK,
I promise you, you just need water.

17:45.880 --> 17:47.800
I said, "I'm engaged"!

17:48.120 --> 17:50.400
[choking] I'm gonna be sick.
I'm gonna be sick.

17:50.640 --> 17:52.320
[Connor] Use little Boy Tracy's jacket.

17:53.080 --> 17:55.440
Ah. Ah, that's better.

17:55.560 --> 17:58.240
-[retching]
-Ah, yeah.

17:58.760 --> 18:00.920
That's my jacket. Oh, sorry.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.760
Don't rescue me.
I'll show you how to be a poet.

18:05.560 --> 18:08.400
Want my fiancée. Fee-yon-say.

18:09.120 --> 18:10.200
Who you gonna marry?

18:10.280 --> 18:13.640
Who? Beyonce.
Yeah, that's how you rhyme.

18:17.880 --> 18:19.360
[doorbell rings]

18:21.880 --> 18:23.760
-Tracey.
-Nah.

18:25.400 --> 18:26.400
[Connor] What're you talking about?

18:26.480 --> 18:30.480
[indistinct chatter]

18:30.560 --> 18:32.760
in the name of your son,
Jesus of Nazareth...

18:32.840 --> 18:36.360
[indistinct chatter continues]

18:36.440 --> 18:38.240
Root out all evil in this house.

18:38.480 --> 18:40.400
Mum. Mum. Mum!

18:43.000 --> 18:45.400
[continue arguing at once]

18:45.720 --> 18:49.440
You live on a deprived estate.
You should consider auto-lock.

18:50.360 --> 18:53.320
Oh, leftovers. May I?

18:55.920 --> 18:57.680
[Cynthia retching]

19:01.680 --> 19:03.320
[soft thud]

19:04.360 --> 19:05.600
I thought that'd be louder.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.200
Bang! Crash!

19:10.560 --> 19:13.240
What is this? Congo-fried chicken?

19:14.160 --> 19:17.320
What is wrong with all of you?

19:17.480 --> 19:20.000
What is this stupid, stupid shit?

19:20.080 --> 19:22.080
[mocking] Oh, look how confidently
I use profanities.

19:22.800 --> 19:26.680
You! You don't own me, I am mine!

19:27.160 --> 19:28.440
I don't want to break up with you,

19:28.520 --> 19:31.000
I'm just deeply unhappy
in the relationship.

19:31.080 --> 19:33.840
What is so hard to understand about that?
Fucking hell, Connor!

19:33.920 --> 19:34.920
[chewing loudly]

19:35.360 --> 19:38.320
And you! Oh, hi, yeah.

19:38.560 --> 19:40.000
You abused me.

19:40.240 --> 19:42.640
It wasn't severe,
it was very mild abuse,

19:42.720 --> 19:44.040
but nonetheless you abused me.

19:44.120 --> 19:47.760
You put hair growth cream in my nostrils
and all over my face

19:47.840 --> 19:50.160
because you were always trying
to change me. Well, guess what?

19:50.240 --> 19:52.200
You cannot change a vagina!

19:52.280 --> 19:55.360
Yeah, yeah, vagina, and breasts.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.600
Little, droopy, saggy breasts.

19:57.680 --> 19:59.760
And they frown when they sag,

19:59.840 --> 20:02.400
when they think about all the abuse
that you put me through,

20:02.480 --> 20:05.080
and I have lost my train of thought.

20:05.600 --> 20:06.920
Just embrace yourself, yeah?

20:07.080 --> 20:10.320
Because I would rather kiss my cousin
than ever hold your hand again!

20:10.400 --> 20:11.440
[Boy Tracey] Ha! Yeah.

20:11.840 --> 20:13.480
Boy Tracy...

20:14.520 --> 20:17.480
You cannot fuck your cousins.

20:17.800 --> 20:18.800
Yeah?

20:18.880 --> 20:22.560
We will never go back into a time
when that is OK,

20:22.920 --> 20:27.320
and we will never go into a time
when that is trendy or quirky-cool!

20:27.840 --> 20:29.640
-It's legal in the UK.
-Oh!

20:29.720 --> 20:33.040
Well, I... didn't know that.

20:33.920 --> 20:35.720
Now, I've got a sick sister
to take care of.

20:35.800 --> 20:38.160
So all of you lot can get out,
or you can help me!

20:38.880 --> 20:40.680
No, not you.

20:43.120 --> 20:46.120
Cynthia, you're gonna be fine, OK?
You just need water.

20:46.200 --> 20:47.360
I promise you. Look, 'cause--

20:47.440 --> 20:50.280
I want my fiancée to rub my back.

20:50.360 --> 20:51.760
You don't have a fiancée,
you just need water.

20:51.840 --> 20:53.720
Can someone please get
her some water?

20:54.160 --> 20:55.160
[Tracey] Oh!

20:56.160 --> 20:57.560
Thanks, babe.

20:58.280 --> 21:00.760
Yeah... we're engaged.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.840
I did say we were gonna
be more than friends.

21:04.320 --> 21:08.440
Sorry, Tra...
[retching]

21:11.480 --> 21:13.000
[Cynthia] It's fell all over Tracey.

21:18.240 --> 21:20.320
-[Mother] No more tears, my dear.
-[Tracey sobbing]

21:20.480 --> 21:23.200
Let your yes be yes,
and your no be no.

21:23.600 --> 21:27.000
Be clear about what you want.
Then nobody can walk all over you.

21:27.600 --> 21:30.200
-Yes, Mum?
-Yes, Mum.

21:31.120 --> 21:32.280
Thank you.

21:32.360 --> 21:33.800
There you go.

21:34.920 --> 21:38.440
-I've left your things in the downstairs.
-Oh, thank you. [sniffing]

21:38.880 --> 21:40.040
Why?

21:41.160 --> 21:43.960
Well, you cannot live here
after your recent "galavantics".

21:44.760 --> 21:46.120
You want to forget the Lord?

21:46.960 --> 21:50.840
OK. When you come crawling back
to his gates,

21:51.000 --> 21:54.160
better mind out he hasn't forgotten
to cut you a key.

21:54.240 --> 21:57.560
-No...
-Well, anyway, goodnight, my dear.

21:58.160 --> 22:00.480
-Cynthia!
-No, no. Mummy!

22:01.320 --> 22:02.760
Did you see that?

22:03.240 --> 22:05.040
My mum just kicked me out!

22:05.200 --> 22:08.360
[crying]
