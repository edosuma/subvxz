00:01.084 --> 00:02.950
[Damian] Previously
on Designated Survivor...

00:03.961 --> 00:05.873
Mommy's not coming home?

00:06.006 --> 00:08.794
No, sweetheart. She's in heaven now,
with the angels.

00:08.926 --> 00:10.792
He's put the brakes
on every major policy initiative.

00:10.928 --> 00:12.089
Including foreign ones.

00:12.221 --> 00:15.213
He canceled trips to Beijing and Jerusalem,
bailed on the IMF meeting.

00:15.349 --> 00:18.137
[Emily] The man just lost his wife,
the mother of his children.

00:18.268 --> 00:19.474
[Tom] I want you to remember

00:19.603 --> 00:22.186
every day for the rest of your life,
what you took from me.

00:22.314 --> 00:24.055
The person I lived for, my wife.

00:24.191 --> 00:27.104
You did it for nothing,
for absolutely no reason.

00:27.236 --> 00:28.772
You lied to me about everything.

00:33.659 --> 00:35.115
[breathing heavily]

00:35.244 --> 00:36.985
They never found Damian's body

00:37.120 --> 00:38.827
or figured out why he was in league
with the Russians.

00:39.623 --> 00:40.954
[gun cocks]

00:48.257 --> 00:53.377
-I shot you. Center mass.
-Another agent asks to meet on a bridge,

00:53.512 --> 00:57.972
| figure she might have something
more than sentiment in mind.

00:58.517 --> 01:00.804
But the Kevlar vest did its job.

01:00.936 --> 01:03.928
| spent the last ten weeks on the run.

01:04.063 --> 01:06.021
Trying to stay alive.

01:06.608 --> 01:07.985
If the Russians find me,

01:08.819 --> 01:12.528
they'll kill me
because they know I've been burned.

01:12.656 --> 01:15.148
If the British find you,
they're looking at a traitor.

01:16.034 --> 01:18.696
-Correct.
-What are you doing here, Damian?

01:18.829 --> 01:21.036
| have something America might want.

01:22.291 --> 01:23.247
Information.

01:26.169 --> 01:28.035
I'm gonna put this gun down.

01:29.673 --> 01:31.038
And we're going to talk.

01:31.174 --> 01:34.212
You put that gun down,
I'm gonna pick it up and shoot you.

01:34.344 --> 01:35.960
| don't think so.

01:49.818 --> 01:51.684
[breathing heavily]

01:52.404 --> 01:54.190
You're right. [grunts]

01:59.328 --> 02:01.740
T-minus 30 minutes and counting
to liftoff

02:01.872 --> 02:03.738
of the unmanned US cargo mission

02:03.874 --> 02:06.457
to save the crippled
International Space Station.

02:06.585 --> 02:07.620
It's been ten days

02:07.753 --> 02:11.087
since a software malfunction
disabled the Soyuz escape capsule...

02:11.214 --> 02:14.752
-Little P, your scrambled eggs are ready.
-[news anchor continues indistinctly]

02:15.594 --> 02:17.255
| don't like scrambled eggs.

02:17.387 --> 02:20.630
-You liked them last week.
-This week, I like pancakes.

02:20.766 --> 02:22.131
| can make you pancakes.

02:22.267 --> 02:23.257
-[door opens]
-[Mike] Ready to roll.

02:27.731 --> 02:28.892
[Penny] It's okay.

02:29.858 --> 02:31.565
Okay. Here.

02:31.902 --> 02:34.860
Promise me you will eat this
in the car on the way to school.

02:35.530 --> 02:36.611
Okay.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.981
Here you go. I love you.

02:39.660 --> 02:40.741
| love you, too.

02:46.416 --> 02:47.952
[Tom] Do you want some scrambled eggs, Mike?

02:48.085 --> 02:51.328
Uh, thank you, sir.
But I liked eggs last week.

02:51.463 --> 02:53.295
-Everybody's a comedian.
-[watch beeping]

02:54.341 --> 02:55.957
Liftoff in 30 minutes, sir.

02:56.093 --> 02:57.709
Okay, thank you.

02:57.844 --> 03:01.257
Fifty years ago, NASA's budget was
4.5% of the federal budget.

03:01.390 --> 03:02.926
Now, it's 0.5%.

03:03.058 --> 03:05.265
-That's a 90% reduction.
- I know, Lyor.

03:05.394 --> 03:07.556
The demise of our space program,
it's a national tragedy.

03:07.688 --> 03:08.553
| know, Lyor.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.271
[Lyor] You know the word
for someone who ignores

03:10.399 --> 03:12.640
-our planet's habitational crisis?
-Normal.

03:12.776 --> 03:14.642
It's misplaced educational priorities.

03:14.778 --> 03:17.065
That's why I went
to Poconos Space Academy.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.063
| came second
on the Interstellar Challenge,

03:19.199 --> 03:21.861
-because Russell Grubman cheated.
-[both] We know, Lyor.

03:23.453 --> 03:25.069
[Tom] Good morning, Rick.
How are we doing?

03:25.205 --> 03:26.570
All systems go, Mr. President.

03:26.707 --> 03:29.449
The package includes
fresh water and a replacement

03:29.584 --> 03:31.450
for the escape capsule's damaged CPU.

03:31.586 --> 03:33.839
Do we know yet what caused the malfunction?

03:33.964 --> 03:37.502
It appears a corrupt software file
damaged the electrical systems.

03:37.634 --> 03:38.795
Provenance unknown.

03:38.927 --> 03:40.509
A $150 billion space station

03:40.637 --> 03:43.425
and the imminent threat to our astronauts
is a lack of fresh water?

03:43.557 --> 03:46.549
Technology changes.
Human biology doesn't.

03:47.144 --> 03:48.680
How is the crew doing?

03:48.812 --> 03:51.179
[Rick] Two Russians, an Italian
and an American.

03:51.314 --> 03:53.726
Minor effects of dehydration,
but they're bearing up.

03:53.859 --> 03:55.600
Is it possible to talk to Commander Watkins?

03:55.736 --> 03:57.067
-Yes, sir.
-Thank you.

03:57.195 --> 03:59.277
[indistinct chatter over radio]

03:59.406 --> 04:00.896
Good morning, Commander.

04:01.032 --> 04:02.318
Hello, Mr. President.

04:03.034 --> 04:04.240
How're you doing?

04:04.369 --> 04:06.656
I could stand a tall glass of lemonade.

04:07.456 --> 04:11.165
But, uh, we've done a pretty good job
of rationing our water.

04:11.293 --> 04:12.533
You certainly have.

04:12.669 --> 04:15.001
| know the last ten days
have been quite an ordeal,

04:15.130 --> 04:19.839
but in the next 16 minutes and 48 seconds,
the care package will be on its way.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.209
-It should take six hours.
-Good to hear, sir.

04:22.345 --> 04:26.009
| want you to know, down here, it feels like
the entire world is praying for you.

04:26.641 --> 04:28.348
We appreciate the support.

04:33.023 --> 04:35.856
[Aaron] How long have you been
working with the Russians?

04:35.984 --> 04:37.270
That's a long story.

04:37.402 --> 04:38.358
Who turned you?

04:38.487 --> 04:41.070
Look, I have time-sensitive information.

04:41.198 --> 04:42.313
Who turned you?

04:42.449 --> 04:46.238
<i>An attache at the Russian Embassy
in London, Alexander Popov. He's dead now.</i>

04:46.369 --> 04:48.747
You joined British intelligence,
but you were working with the Russians.

04:48.872 --> 04:51.409
On the periphery.
Mostly just gathering intel on a select--

04:51.541 --> 04:52.793
Is that a yes?

04:53.460 --> 04:54.495
Yes.

04:54.628 --> 04:57.416
-Was Patrick Lloyd also working with them?
-No.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.333
Why did you obstruct the Icarus investigation

04:59.466 --> 05:01.207
and my attempts to clear
the First Family's name?

05:01.343 --> 05:03.254
You are wasting valuable time.

05:03.386 --> 05:05.377
We have an open-and-shut case against you

05:05.514 --> 05:09.303
for espionage, spying and sabotage
at the highest levels,

05:09.434 --> 05:12.472
which carries penalties
I'm sure you're well aware of.

05:12.604 --> 05:14.971
So I'd suggest
you start answering our questions.

05:22.489 --> 05:25.402
Thirty years ago,
the Kremlin had a minority ownership

05:25.534 --> 05:27.946
in Icarus Astrotech
through a shell company.

05:28.078 --> 05:29.864
-The Soviets had stake in Icarus?
-[Damian] Yes.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.454
To keep tabs
on American military hardware.

05:32.582 --> 05:36.120
A mission that ended with perestroika
when Moscow divested.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.585
But when Lloyd started setting up
the First Lady and her mother

05:38.713 --> 05:43.002
by suggesting an ongoing bribery scandal
with Icarus, Moscow got worried.

05:43.134 --> 05:46.263
Uh, they thought if we discovered
the Icarus-Russia connection,

05:46.388 --> 05:47.753
we'd think
Russia was in league with Lloyd.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.471
And you know what that would've led to:

05:49.599 --> 05:52.216
false suspicions that Russia was behind
the Capitol bombing

05:52.352 --> 05:54.593
and the attempts on the president's life.

05:54.729 --> 05:57.437
That Moscow was trying
to bring down your government.

05:57.566 --> 06:00.058
| was deputized
to prevent another cold war.

06:00.193 --> 06:03.811
-Oh, wow. So you're actually a good guy.
-I helped you catch Lloyd, didn't I?

06:03.947 --> 06:06.780
Then you torched a warehouse
and tipped off the banker

06:06.908 --> 06:09.115
-who helped set up the First Lady.
-I'll admit to that.

06:09.244 --> 06:10.484
And while we were spinning our wheels,

06:10.620 --> 06:12.907
you allowed the First Lady
to get sucked into a legal battle

06:13.039 --> 06:14.370
that indirectly ended her life.

06:14.499 --> 06:18.367
I'll admit my account is not square,
which is why I'm here with information.

06:18.503 --> 06:22.167
-Tell it to the judge.
-You have a rocket launch in 15 minutes.

06:22.299 --> 06:24.757
Stop it now, or you're going to lose it.

06:24.885 --> 06:25.875
You're a liar.

06:26.011 --> 06:27.752
No, I am telling the truth.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.926
And if you don't listen,
that rocket is going down.

06:32.601 --> 06:35.093
If we abort the rescue mission now,

06:35.228 --> 06:37.435
by the time we're in a position
to launch another one,

06:37.564 --> 06:39.771
-the astronauts will likely be dead.
-Yes, sir.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.688
Who provided us with the intel
that our space agency may have been hacked?

06:42.819 --> 06:44.275
A Russian operative.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.645
Well, that alone is a reason
for healthy skepticism.

06:46.781 --> 06:49.364
Normally. But Russia's got
more to lose here than we do.

06:49.492 --> 06:53.235
Two of their astronauts are up there
and more invested in their space program.

06:53.371 --> 06:56.864
Son of a bitch.
Truth is we don't really have a choice.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.038
If we've been hacked and we launch,
we lose a rocket.

07:00.170 --> 07:03.788
If we don't, the astronauts die.
The calculus only cuts one way.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.210
[dispatcher 1] All vents are open?

07:05.342 --> 07:06.673
[dispatcher 2] Copy. Vents open.

07:06.801 --> 07:09.054
[dispatcher 1]
GLS is go for main engine start.

07:09.179 --> 07:12.388
[dispatcher 2] Two, one, zero.

07:13.016 --> 07:16.429
[dispatcher 1] Main engine start.
Liftoff. Positive rate.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.723
Liftoff confirmed. Alpheus Four has--

07:18.855 --> 07:20.311
Congratulations, sir.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.601
[dispatcher 1] Go for throfttle up.

07:21.733 --> 07:23.019
[dispatcher 2] Throttle up confirmed.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.396
[news anchor]
A beautiful liftoff for Alpheus Four

07:25.528 --> 07:29.066
on its mission to resupply and repair
the International Space Station.

07:29.199 --> 07:30.860
The unmanned vehicle carries
precious cargo.

07:31.534 --> 07:33.195
[dispatcher 1] Initiate roll program.

07:33.328 --> 07:35.615
-[dispatcher 2] Roger. Roll program.
-[alarm sounding]

07:35.747 --> 07:37.158
[dynamics officer] We have an anomaly.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.406
An off-nominal trajectory
heading uprange.

07:39.542 --> 07:42.910
-[Tom] What just happened?
-Command Control, we need a status update.

07:43.046 --> 07:46.914
[officer] The rocket is nonresponsive
Alpheus Four is veering toward the coast.

07:47.050 --> 07:48.632
Recommend immediate destruct.

07:48.760 --> 07:51.092
Sir, the rocket's going down
in a populated area.

07:52.347 --> 07:53.508
[indistinct chatter over radio]

07:55.266 --> 07:57.849
We have to terminate the launch.
I'm sorry.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.889
[dynamics officer] RSO, execute.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.560
[alarm continues sounding]

08:08.071 --> 08:09.482
You son of a bitch.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.565
Hannah, we need to talk.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.652
[theme music playing]

08:25.005 --> 08:27.212
[Lyor] We have to get those astronauts
water, fast.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.047
How long before we can launch
another rocket?

08:29.175 --> 08:31.917
[sighs] We need to ground the fleet
until we can ascertain what went wrong,

08:32.053 --> 08:34.715
-it's standard protocol.
-Which the president can override.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.964
Yes, but we have logistical problems as well.

08:37.100 --> 08:40.342
The replacement CPU needs to be
remanufactured. Reprogrammed.

08:40.477 --> 08:41.980
-That could take days.
-At a minimum.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.472
We can't get
a rescue rocket up there in time.

08:44.607 --> 08:45.642
So we need help.

08:45.775 --> 08:46.640
Yes.

08:46.776 --> 08:49.484
Russia's the only country with a rocket
that can get up quickly enough

08:49.612 --> 08:51.068
to resupply the space station.

08:51.197 --> 08:54.064
The person who predicted this disaster
is a Russian double agent.

08:54.200 --> 08:57.113
Which makes Moscow's agenda
and credibility questionable at best.

08:57.245 --> 09:00.203
Get me Ambassador Pavlov,
reach out to Secretary Moss.

09:00.331 --> 09:01.992
They have a long-standing relationship.

09:02.125 --> 09:05.208
-We're gonna need all the help we can get.
-Yes, sir.

09:06.796 --> 09:08.582
-You're a really lucky guy.
-Hannah.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.298
Magically appearing at the right time
with the right information.

09:11.426 --> 09:14.134
I've been sitting on this information
but I needed something to trade.

09:14.262 --> 09:15.172
It's too late now.

09:15.305 --> 09:19.344
Look, hacking's one of the things
I've been working on solving for Russia.

09:19.476 --> 09:21.717
The central bank and
national gas companies

09:21.853 --> 09:23.890
have all been victimized
over the last six months.

09:24.022 --> 09:26.480
This NASA hack is just the latest attack.

09:26.608 --> 09:30.852
Someone is hunting big game.
And Russia and the US are both targets.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.570
-Do you have any other intel to share?
-Maybe.

09:33.698 --> 09:37.987
All right. [sighs]
You're gonna cough it up right now.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.621
In return for what?

09:39.746 --> 09:42.113
We won't put you in a cage
and throw away the key. How about that?

09:42.248 --> 09:43.409
[Damian] This might interest you.

09:43.541 --> 09:47.000
The American space program isn't the only one
that's been compromised.

09:50.215 --> 09:53.833
Our space program, Roscosmos,
would like to send one of our rockets,

09:53.968 --> 09:57.006
but we are constrained
by our launch schedule.

09:57.138 --> 10:01.723
With all due respect, I don't believe
your launch schedules have anything to do

10:01.851 --> 10:04.434
-with your inability to help us.
-I don't know what you mean...

10:04.562 --> 10:06.974
Roscosmos has been hacked, just like NASA.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.940
Both of our space programs
are victims of the same cyberattack.

10:10.068 --> 10:12.651
Where do you obtain your information?

10:12.779 --> 10:15.487
From one of your spies
who is now in our custody.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.573
Mr. Ambassador,
it is in your country's interest

10:18.701 --> 10:22.035
to help bring these astronauts home.
Two of which are yours.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.120
What do you propose?

10:24.249 --> 10:26.741
[Cornelius] If both our countries' programs
have been compromised,

10:26.876 --> 10:30.039
we can put our heads together
and work to find a solution.

10:32.048 --> 10:33.504
| would like to talk to Moscow.

10:35.343 --> 10:37.209
Of course.
Thank you, Mr. Ambassador.

10:43.810 --> 10:48.099
[sighs] You know him better than anyone.
What do you think he'll do?

10:48.231 --> 10:52.065
I'm not hopeful, sir. I thought
Dimitri would be more forthcoming.

10:52.986 --> 10:56.104
The fact he wasn't suggests
that he's fronting for an administration

10:56.239 --> 10:59.573
that's more worried about saving face
than anything else.

11:00.451 --> 11:02.067
Which means we can't trust him.

11:02.745 --> 11:03.906
What do you suggest?

11:04.038 --> 11:05.494
Hardball, sir.

11:05.623 --> 11:08.706
Get on the phone with President Volkov.
Read him the riot act.

11:08.835 --> 11:12.044
Before we get to that,
I'd like to try something else first.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.330
Stay close, I may need you.

11:15.884 --> 11:18.000
-Yes, sir.
-Thank you, Cornelius.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.800
Mike, find me Seth Wright.
| need to talk to him.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.217
Yes, sir.

11:26.060 --> 11:29.303
So the hack has affected
both NASA and Roscosmos,

11:29.439 --> 11:32.352
interfering with each country's ability
to launch a rescue vehicle.

11:32.483 --> 11:34.895
-[reporters clamoring]
-Thank you. Do you know who's behind this?

11:35.028 --> 11:38.487
Both countries are coordinating intelligence
in an effort to get to the bottom of this.

11:38.615 --> 11:42.074
And each, uh, space administration
is working with the other.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.863
[Hannah] Chuck, give us something.

11:43.995 --> 11:47.613
I've gone through thousands of lines
of NASA's mission code.

11:47.749 --> 11:50.366
If it's a hack on our program,
| can't find it.

11:50.501 --> 11:52.492
No digital footprint. Nothing.

11:52.629 --> 11:54.336
So whatever the hacker did,
he embedded it.

11:54.464 --> 11:58.002
It would take months to go through
every line to find the anomaly.

11:58.134 --> 12:00.796
[Hannah sighs] Those astronauts are dying.

12:02.263 --> 12:03.503
Who is behind this?

12:03.640 --> 12:06.803
| have a lead.
A cyber-terrorist named Rook Storm.

12:06.935 --> 12:09.518
-Rook Storm is a myth.
-No, he's not.

12:09.646 --> 12:10.681
Who's Rook Storm?

12:10.813 --> 12:15.023
They say he hacked into the Kremlin's
mainframe on a dare a few years ago.

12:15.151 --> 12:18.189
Released sensitive internal documents
exposing corruption at the Politburo.

12:18.321 --> 12:21.689
Then disappeared before
Russian intelligence could kill him.

12:21.824 --> 12:24.612
He pops up on tech forums
from time to time to gloat.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.906
-He's behind this?
-[Damian] No, he's out of the game.

12:27.038 --> 12:30.030
But there are only a handful of operators
who could have pulled this off.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.578
-He'll know them.
-Where can we find him?

12:33.253 --> 12:35.494
He'll only open the door for me.
He'll shoot you.

12:36.464 --> 12:39.126
-[Hannah] I'm not taking him.
-[Aaron] We don't have a choice.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.091
We do. We interrogate him.

12:41.219 --> 12:44.428
How long till he cracks?
How long till you'd crack?

12:44.555 --> 12:46.967
I'll tell you how long:
too long to save those astronauts.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.057
We'll keep him on a short leash.
We need him.

12:49.185 --> 12:52.348
-I disagree. He's a liar.
-Who's two for two.

12:52.480 --> 12:55.393
He predicted the rocket crash,
he told us Roscosmos had been hacked.

12:55.525 --> 12:58.893
He's playing us, Aaron. He could be
sending us on a wild goose chase.

12:59.028 --> 13:00.405
| understand why you think that.

13:00.530 --> 13:03.397
And I can't ignore the fact
that you two have a history.

13:03.533 --> 13:04.819
Aaron.

13:04.951 --> 13:08.819
Now, look. Solving the NASA hack
is our prime directive here.

13:08.955 --> 13:11.697
If you can't play ball,
I'll find someone else who can.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.383
-Mr. Ambassador.
-Very clever.

13:24.512 --> 13:28.255
Your little press conference put
my country's credibility on the line.

13:28.391 --> 13:30.598
We don't have time for stonewalling.
The clock is ticking.

13:30.727 --> 13:34.265
It's not about pointing fingers, Dimitri.
It's about working together.

13:34.397 --> 13:36.764
No one needs dead astronauts
and failed missions.

13:36.899 --> 13:39.357
-If I say no?
-We'll parade Damian Rennett

13:39.485 --> 13:43.695
on national television as a Russian spy.
Severe sanctions will follow.

13:44.907 --> 13:49.526
[sighs] I'll see to it that the Roscosmos
engineers coordinate with your people.

13:49.662 --> 13:52.040
Good. We'll also be bringing in
private industry.

13:52.165 --> 13:56.124
Smartest minds we can find.
Can you get your rescue ship in the air?

13:56.252 --> 13:58.789
Yes. We've removed
most of the damaged code,

13:58.921 --> 14:01.174
enough to get Equis Two into orbit.

14:01.299 --> 14:03.256
Then, please, launch it now.

14:03.384 --> 14:07.719
To what purpose? It can't dock until that hack
has been completely reversed.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.633
No. President Kirkman is right, Dimitri.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.882
It's a six-hour flight
to the space station.

14:12.018 --> 14:14.510
You wait till everything's spic and span
down here before ignition,

14:14.645 --> 14:15.931
it'll be too late.

14:17.231 --> 14:18.357
Understood.

14:18.483 --> 14:20.099
Thank you, Mr. Ambassador.

14:20.735 --> 14:21.691
Dimitri.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.605
[sighs]

14:27.742 --> 14:31.406
You know, Moscow's whole modus operandi is

14:31.537 --> 14:34.120
avoiding the specter
of public embarrassment.

14:34.248 --> 14:37.161
You threatened him with that.
Not a happy man.

14:37.293 --> 14:40.160
| don't need his happiness.
| need his cooperation.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.252
[door opens]

14:41.381 --> 14:43.167
Mr. President, you're wanted in Command Ops.

14:43.299 --> 14:45.757
-Thank you. Excuse me, Cornelius.
-[Cornelius] Mm-hmm.

14:48.346 --> 14:52.010
-What the hell is it now?
-Another electrical problem, sir.

14:52.141 --> 14:54.098
The EATCS has failed.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.717
What is that?

14:55.853 --> 14:58.140
[dynamics officer] External active
thermal control system, sir.

14:58.272 --> 15:00.183
-The coolant pump, essentially.
-What does that mean?

15:00.316 --> 15:03.183
A liquid ammonia coolant loop
along the station's main thrust

15:03.319 --> 15:06.311
carries waste heat
to the photovoltaic radiator panels.

15:06.447 --> 15:07.357
In English, please.

15:07.490 --> 15:10.107
Cabin temperatures
are already at 98 degrees.

15:10.243 --> 15:13.452
And they're going to spike to 120
in the next few hours.

15:13.579 --> 15:17.573
We're talking about a seriously dehydrated
crew with no access to water.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.834
We're talking about a death sentence.

15:26.551 --> 15:28.838
[indistinct chatter over radio]

15:30.346 --> 15:31.552
Commander, what's your status?

15:31.681 --> 15:34.594
Mission control says
we have a clogged turbine.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.426
Crystallized ammonia, most likely.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.352
I'm gonna prep for extravehicular activity.

15:40.481 --> 15:41.721
Absolutely not.

15:41.858 --> 15:44.475
It's too risky.
A spacewalk is a last resort.

15:44.610 --> 15:45.600
[Watkins] I have to try.

15:45.736 --> 15:47.818
I'd rather die out there than in here.

15:47.947 --> 15:51.030
Commander, we're not there yet.
Let us try to fix this.

15:51.159 --> 15:52.945
[Tom] Commander, I know I'm asking a lot.

15:53.077 --> 15:55.364
But I need you to trust us.

15:55.496 --> 15:57.737
We have some of the brilliant minds
from around the world

15:57.874 --> 16:01.208
-working together to try and bring you home.
-Yes, sir.

16:01.335 --> 16:02.712
Hang in there.

16:03.546 --> 16:04.877
[beeps]

16:05.548 --> 16:07.835
We've been consulting
with the Russians

16:07.967 --> 16:09.753
about the best way to unclog the turbines.

16:09.886 --> 16:13.971
Unfortunately, there's no consensus.
It's highly specialized equipment.

16:14.557 --> 16:17.015
-Who's the manufacturer?
-Apache Aerospace.

16:17.143 --> 16:18.884
[Emily] A former government contractor, sir.

16:19.020 --> 16:22.012
Their company is owned by a tech guru
named Andrea Frost.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.560
-Let's get her here.
-Yes, sir.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.062
[Mike] You're wanted in the Residence.

16:28.404 --> 16:30.395
This note was from your principal.

16:31.032 --> 16:33.899
She says you were in a fight
with another girl today at school.

16:34.702 --> 16:36.067
Yeah.

16:36.204 --> 16:41.324
She also says that this is the second time
it's happened in three weeks.

16:43.711 --> 16:44.701
| know.

16:45.671 --> 16:48.208
So why were you in a fight?

16:49.091 --> 16:49.876
[sighs]

16:50.510 --> 16:52.501
Sweetheart, I know a lot's happened.

16:54.555 --> 16:58.423
But I need you to promise me that you're gonna
be nice to the other kids at school.

16:59.227 --> 17:00.262
Yep.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.602
-Promise.
-Okay.

17:04.272 --> 17:09.063
Hey, what do you say you and |
make a chocolate milkshake and hang out?

17:10.279 --> 17:12.395
Is it okay if I go lay down?

17:13.449 --> 17:15.109
I'm tired.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.069
Yeah.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.070
Of course. Yeah.

17:27.547 --> 17:28.287
[sighs]

17:29.298 --> 17:32.006
Dr. Frost, thank you again for coming.

17:32.134 --> 17:33.795
This is a command performance.

17:33.928 --> 17:36.215
I'm not exactly getting along
with Uncle Sam these days.

17:36.347 --> 17:37.963
| was just reading about that.

17:38.099 --> 17:41.842
You're in litigation for $200 million
for fuel cells delivered to NASA.

17:41.978 --> 17:42.809
Correct.

17:42.937 --> 17:45.474
The NASA administrator refused
to accept them because you were late.

17:45.606 --> 17:47.347
NASA kept changing the specs.

17:47.483 --> 17:50.020
Doctor, I didn't ask you here to talk
about unpaid bills.

17:50.152 --> 17:52.234
| asked you here because we need your help.

17:52.363 --> 17:55.105
We need our best and brightest
to get us through this crisis.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.448
-Can I count on you?
-Of course.

17:57.577 --> 17:58.612
Great.

18:00.288 --> 18:01.323
Thank you.

18:02.164 --> 18:05.031
Emily, please escort Dr. Frost
to Command Ops.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.328
Absolutely.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.419
Graduated Brown University.

18:14.552 --> 18:18.216
Doctorate at MIT.
Dozens of patents to her name.

18:18.347 --> 18:21.180
She is a rising star.

18:21.976 --> 18:23.512
If you say so, sir.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.851
You're not a fan?

18:26.480 --> 18:29.563
She was actually one of my proctors
at space camp.

18:29.692 --> 18:32.480
Uh, my model rocket was a quantum leap

18:32.612 --> 18:35.229
over Russell Grubman's
puny little erector set.

18:35.364 --> 18:36.775
But Dr. Frost...

18:36.907 --> 18:38.614
She bought into his pretty boy act.
That's all it was.

18:38.743 --> 18:40.074
Like everybody else.
Hook, line and sinker.

18:40.202 --> 18:44.241
He had kind of a symmetrical face
and his haircut was ahead of its time,

18:44.373 --> 18:45.875
but she had no right to...

18:49.211 --> 18:50.497
I'm gonna go now, sir.

18:51.213 --> 18:52.499
Good idea.

18:54.550 --> 18:57.258
[Hannah] This better work.
Time is running out for them.

18:57.386 --> 18:58.797
[Damian] I'm aware.

19:04.060 --> 19:05.425
[Damian grunts]

19:05.561 --> 19:07.143
This thing's a little tight.

19:07.271 --> 19:10.059
You don't like it there?
| can put it around your neck.

19:15.738 --> 19:17.354
[doorbell rings]

19:22.244 --> 19:24.576
[both speaking Russian]

19:25.748 --> 19:26.954
[in English] English, please.

19:27.083 --> 19:29.620
You are police. I don't talk to police.

19:29.752 --> 19:33.871
Good. Because I'm FBI.
Damian says you like money.

19:34.757 --> 19:37.249
Yes. Why? You brought some?

19:37.385 --> 19:40.594
| brought a promise that I won't take
all of yours as proceeds of cybercrime.

19:40.721 --> 19:43.179
How about that?
Shall we talk?

19:46.727 --> 19:48.309
[Hannah]
We're looking for who hacked NASA.

19:48.437 --> 19:49.723
Empty Set.

19:49.855 --> 19:52.062
-What is that?
-Not what. Who.

19:52.191 --> 19:56.401
The leader of an anti-imperialist
hacker collective.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.816
He posts on dark web forums
under that moniker.

19:58.948 --> 19:59.983
You're sure he did it?

20:00.116 --> 20:02.323
No. But his people are capable of it.

20:02.451 --> 20:05.534
They took down the State Department
website last year.

20:05.663 --> 20:08.621
Um, space exploration
is one of his targets.

20:08.749 --> 20:12.208
-If his crew didn't do it, he'll know who did.
-Where can we find him?

20:13.546 --> 20:14.581
Where?

20:27.309 --> 20:28.299
Are you serious?

20:28.436 --> 20:30.097
[Sergei] He's an orchid nut.

20:30.229 --> 20:34.439
Posts all this drivel about the symbolism
of the beautiful, indigenous plant

20:34.567 --> 20:37.309
that can fight off alien predators.

20:37.445 --> 20:38.651
Okay, what does he look like?

20:38.779 --> 20:41.157
Big guy. Beard. Goes by Ollie.
Can't miss him.

20:45.786 --> 20:46.742
Damian,

20:48.664 --> 20:51.907
you and I will never speak again.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.831
[speaks in Russian]

21:00.885 --> 21:02.467
[indistinct chatter]

21:20.321 --> 21:21.857
[Hannah] Hello, Ollie.

21:22.823 --> 21:23.733
| know you?

21:23.866 --> 21:26.198
FBI. I've a few questions.

21:27.703 --> 21:29.694
[people gasping]

21:31.582 --> 21:32.993
[panting]

21:39.256 --> 21:40.371
[grunts]

21:41.967 --> 21:43.878
| got a clean shot.
You're a sitting duck.

21:45.471 --> 21:47.303
[grunts and groans]

21:47.431 --> 21:48.387
Come on.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.226
[grunts]

21:52.937 --> 21:53.802
[Damian grunting]

21:58.859 --> 21:59.894
[grunts]

22:05.783 --> 22:07.569
[groaning and breathing heavily]

22:23.384 --> 22:26.752
The computer attack on the space programs,
| need the code.

22:26.887 --> 22:28.048
| didn't do it.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.467
We know the NASA hack is straight out
of your playbook.

22:30.599 --> 22:35.139
So help us diagnose it or you die in prison
for trying to murder a federal agent.

22:35.271 --> 22:39.185
| don't know who did it.
But I analyzed it.

22:39.316 --> 22:41.728
[breathing heavily]
It exploits a weakness in NASA's OS.

22:41.861 --> 22:44.603
Roscosmos runs
on a similar software platform.

22:44.738 --> 22:47.867
-So the hack affects both space programs.
-Yes.

22:47.992 --> 22:49.983
- I need details.
-[Oliver sighs]

22:50.119 --> 22:55.489
The hacker used a DRAM rowhammer exploit
to gain kernel privileges.

22:55.624 --> 22:58.457
Hey, Chuck.
Yeah, I've got something for you.

22:58.586 --> 23:00.076
Once more with feeling.

23:02.047 --> 23:03.208
[Tom] Rick, where are we at?

23:03.340 --> 23:06.799
Cabin temperature's at 116, sir.
Not sustainable for the crew.

23:06.927 --> 23:09.635
There's a difference of opinion
as to the best course of action.

23:09.763 --> 23:12.300
NASA and Roscosmos
now favor a spacewalk.

23:12.433 --> 23:14.595
-[sighs]
-[Andrea] My company manufactured

23:14.727 --> 23:16.092
the external coolant pump.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.811
-There's a better way.
-We're listening.

23:18.939 --> 23:21.317
We can intervene manually,

23:21.442 --> 23:23.103
deliberately creating a short

23:23.235 --> 23:26.318
which will send a surge
to the external turbine motor.

23:26.447 --> 23:29.940
It'll briefly become overcharged,
forcing the turbine to clear the motor.

23:30.075 --> 23:31.361
Or it will burn out the motor.

23:31.493 --> 23:34.360
Cabin temperatures will spike.
The crew will be dead in minutes.

23:34.496 --> 23:39.115
Commander, your lives are at stake.
| would like your opinion.

23:39.251 --> 23:44.041
I think we're now past the point where any
of us can physically manage a spacewalk.

23:44.173 --> 23:46.835
I've met Dr. Frost. I trust her.

23:48.344 --> 23:50.506
| think we have our answer.

23:50.638 --> 23:51.594
Yes, sir.

23:56.143 --> 23:57.304
Initiate the surge.

23:57.436 --> 23:58.847
[man] Set command trip function
to inhibit.

23:58.979 --> 24:01.186
Command warning alarm to bypass.

24:01.315 --> 24:02.851
Command voltage charge to arm.

24:02.983 --> 24:04.144
Command voltage.

24:04.276 --> 24:06.358
[device whirring and beeping]

24:08.197 --> 24:10.108
[indistinct chatter over radio]

24:14.203 --> 24:15.693
Come on.

24:19.208 --> 24:21.165
[beeping]

24:21.293 --> 24:26.333
Sir, turbine is operational.
Cabin temperature is dropping.

24:26.465 --> 24:27.705
[scattered applause and cheers]

24:28.384 --> 24:29.840
Congratulations, Commander.

24:29.969 --> 24:33.462
Thank you, sir.
[sighs] Now about that water?

24:33.597 --> 24:35.008
Russia's Equis Two is en route.

24:35.140 --> 24:37.757
[Rick] We're still working on the codes
so Equis Two can dock.

24:37.893 --> 24:40.305
-Keep the faith.
-Yes, sir.

24:41.021 --> 24:42.261
Very well done.

24:42.398 --> 24:44.014
Thank you, sir.

24:49.571 --> 24:51.528
The New York Times is pestering Seth

24:51.657 --> 24:53.989
for a direct quote from you
about the space station.

24:54.743 --> 24:57.235
Give them hopes, prayers
and our best efforts.

24:57.371 --> 24:59.783
Nothing specific until we're through this.

24:59.915 --> 25:03.408
-We're not in the business of predictions.
-Understood. I'll let him know.

25:05.921 --> 25:07.423
[Tom] She's been in a fight.

25:08.382 --> 25:09.372
Sir?

25:11.010 --> 25:15.049
My daughter, who's never even
raised her voice, she's been in a fight.

25:15.180 --> 25:19.139
-Apparently, this isn't the first one.
-She's been through a lot.

25:19.268 --> 25:21.760
| know. I'll have to talk with her principal.

25:21.895 --> 25:23.932
But it's obvious what's happening.

25:24.064 --> 25:25.520
She misses her mom.

25:26.442 --> 25:27.432
Yeah.

25:28.861 --> 25:31.023
| don't know how to get her through this.

25:31.155 --> 25:33.442
She'll get through it herself.
You just have to be there.

25:33.574 --> 25:37.488
I'm trying, but she treats me
like I'm a cone in the middle of the road.

25:37.619 --> 25:39.485
Something she needs to get around.

25:39.621 --> 25:41.953
Respectfully, sir, that's not it at all.

25:42.708 --> 25:44.164
Then what is it?

25:44.293 --> 25:47.536
It's not what you're doing.
It's that you're doing it.

25:47.671 --> 25:49.582
She knows you're there.

25:50.132 --> 25:52.123
Take it from a girl who didn't have a dad.

25:53.552 --> 25:54.633
[Emily sighs]

25:55.471 --> 25:56.552
That's everything.

25:57.014 --> 25:58.470
[sighs]

25:59.266 --> 26:00.802
Thank you, Emily.

26:04.980 --> 26:07.768
[door opens and closes]

26:07.900 --> 26:09.482
[indistinct chatter]

26:10.319 --> 26:12.526
-Can I talk to you about something?
-Sure.

26:12.654 --> 26:15.146
What's the statute of limitations
on a contract claim?

26:15.282 --> 26:16.363
What kind?

26:16.492 --> 26:18.859
-When I was at space camp in 1997--
-Not this again.

26:18.994 --> 26:20.860
-It was a breach of contract.
-[chuckles] Lyor.

26:20.996 --> 26:24.705
My parents paid for six weeks of aeronautics
instruction for their precocious son.

26:24.833 --> 26:28.701
In exchange for which the camp undertook
a promise to treat all campers fairly.

26:28.837 --> 26:30.623
It was an award.

26:30.756 --> 26:32.838
A discretionary award you had no right to.

26:32.966 --> 26:35.503
And even if you did,
there were no damages.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.132
There are 20 years of damages.

26:45.020 --> 26:47.261
Could've shot you today, you know.

26:48.190 --> 26:49.521
Twice.

26:52.528 --> 26:56.396
-Do you wonder why I didn't?
-Because you're playing a longer game.

26:56.532 --> 26:59.024
Working with me brings you in
from the cold.

26:59.827 --> 27:01.693
What if I told you there was more to it?

27:01.829 --> 27:05.117
What if I told you to shut up
or I'm gonna shove you in the trunk?

27:06.875 --> 27:09.037
-[cell phone rings]
-Hey.

27:09.169 --> 27:10.785
It's amazing.

27:10.921 --> 27:14.255
It's the type of hack that could
induce bit flips in the page data entries.

27:14.383 --> 27:15.873
No time for you to geek out.

27:17.219 --> 27:20.678
Right, so this type of malware can't be
downloaded remotely.

27:20.806 --> 27:24.174
Too much code to get past
NASA's and Roscosmos's firewalls.

27:24.309 --> 27:25.174
Meaning what?

27:25.310 --> 27:27.176
[Chuck]
The malware had to be uploaded on site.

27:27.312 --> 27:30.225
Turns out the hacks were local

27:30.357 --> 27:33.019
at the NASA facility in DC
and the Russian Embassy.

27:33.152 --> 27:36.941
Same day. So I crunched personnel data
to find a common denominator.

27:37.072 --> 27:39.860
Chuck. I need a name, not a recipe. Okay?

27:39.992 --> 27:41.983
[Chuck] Shane Gillespie. A plumber.

27:42.119 --> 27:42.950
A spy?

27:43.078 --> 27:46.036
No, a plumber.
The beer belly, butt crack variety.

27:46.165 --> 27:50.204
Contractors are given swipe cards
to access government facilities in DC.

27:50.335 --> 27:52.042
That's how he got into the Operating System?

27:52.171 --> 27:54.754
[Chuck] I'm betting the access card
encoded the virus.

27:55.757 --> 27:58.249
-One swipe, you're past the firewall.
-[door beeps]

28:00.429 --> 28:04.889
All this high-tech security, and a guy
who unclogs toilets circumvented it.

28:05.017 --> 28:07.133
-So we need the card.
-[Chuck] It'll have the code.

28:07.269 --> 28:11.137
We could reverse engineer the hack.
Patch the operating systems.

28:11.273 --> 28:13.139
Meaning the rescue rocket could safely dock.

28:13.275 --> 28:14.436
We can save the crew.

28:14.568 --> 28:16.855
He works in Baltimore.
I'll send you his deets.

28:29.917 --> 28:31.123
-[Hannah] Mrs. Gillespie?
-Yes.

28:31.251 --> 28:34.789
I'm Hannah Wells, FBI.
| need to speak to your husband.

28:34.922 --> 28:36.128
That's not gonna be possible.

28:36.256 --> 28:38.748
Ma'am, it's urgent.
People's lives are at stake.

28:38.884 --> 28:41.797
| understand, but my husband's dead.

28:52.314 --> 28:55.102
[Chuck] Shane Gillespie drowned ten days ago.
The day after the hacks.

28:55.234 --> 28:56.224
Foul play?

28:56.360 --> 28:59.728
The coroner's report was inconclusive.
They dredged him out of Lake Roland.

28:59.863 --> 29:02.651
The card likely wasn't on him.
What else do we know about him?

29:02.783 --> 29:04.649
A chronic gambler, deep in debt.

29:04.785 --> 29:07.117
Anonymous bitcoin transfers
to his account.

29:07.246 --> 29:11.285
And social media activity suggests his tech
know-how didn't run deeper

29:11.416 --> 29:14.283
-than an obsession with fantasy football.
-So he was a mark.

29:14.419 --> 29:16.797
-[Chuck] Yeah. An easy one.
-Thanks, Chuck.

29:16.922 --> 29:19.755
We checked the van, his basement,
the bedroom, his toolbox.

29:20.509 --> 29:22.625
He still owed money.
He likely kept the card

29:22.761 --> 29:24.172
in case he needed another job.

29:24.304 --> 29:27.296
He had to stash it somewhere.
When you hide something--

29:27.432 --> 29:29.639
You grasp the familiar.

29:31.186 --> 29:32.688
And our guy loved sports.

29:40.362 --> 29:41.352
Damian.

29:46.535 --> 29:48.025
[clatters]

29:51.957 --> 29:52.992
Hello.

29:56.169 --> 29:57.421
[Cornelius] Sir, there's been a hiccup.

29:57.546 --> 30:01.585
All Russia has to do is upload
the new software to Equis Two to dock.

30:01.717 --> 30:03.424
-But they're balking.
-Why?

30:03.552 --> 30:07.420
To finish debugging the Russian program,
our guys need to get inside their network.

30:07.556 --> 30:10.093
They're afraid of us getting a look
at their proprietary technology.

30:10.225 --> 30:12.057
[Cornelius]
They're afraid of even more than that.

30:12.185 --> 30:14.927
With this Damian Rennett business,
they fear retaliation.

30:15.063 --> 30:17.725
Let's give them a taste.
Set up a press conference.

30:17.858 --> 30:19.815
We'll hold the Russians accountable
for their espionage.

30:19.943 --> 30:23.402
Uh, sir, if I may be so bold: we may get more
here with honey than vinegar.

30:23.530 --> 30:26.693
No. I won't let Russia
hold us to ransom for anything.

30:26.825 --> 30:30.693
-They have as much to lose as we do.
-A point I would like to make.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.537
Let me, uh, bend Dimitri's ear.
Sweet talk him.

30:33.665 --> 30:36.282
If he doesn't play ball,
then you wheel out the heavy artillery.

30:36.418 --> 30:37.829
Get it done, fast.

30:37.961 --> 30:40.077
-She's ready for you, sir.
-Thank you.

30:43.091 --> 30:48.086
Principal Feltner, thank you very much
for coming by. Please.

30:48.221 --> 30:49.211
Of course, sir.

30:49.931 --> 30:54.767
Your letter said my daughter has been involved
in a number of incidents over the last month.

30:54.895 --> 30:56.306
Yes, sir.

30:56.438 --> 30:59.146
Obviously, the death of her mother
has been devastating.

30:59.941 --> 31:03.070
It's my opinion
that she is lashing out in anger.

31:03.195 --> 31:04.936
| don't think that's it at all.

31:05.072 --> 31:05.903
You don't?

31:06.031 --> 31:10.946
Each situation has been an instance of Penny
defending someone who's being bullied.

31:11.953 --> 31:14.490
You're saying that she's protecting
other children?

31:14.623 --> 31:18.491
Not atypical behavior for a child
who has suffered a terrible loss.

31:18.627 --> 31:20.209
[sighs]

31:21.380 --> 31:23.667
She doesn't want anyone else to be hurt.

31:23.799 --> 31:25.631
She's a sensitive child.

31:26.635 --> 31:31.380
But maybe we can help channel
that sensitivity in a more constructive way.

31:31.515 --> 31:33.097
Of course.

31:45.028 --> 31:46.769
[door buzzes]

31:46.905 --> 31:48.441
[indistinct chatter]

31:56.331 --> 31:57.617
[officer] Sign here.

31:58.834 --> 32:00.074
So what now?

32:01.002 --> 32:05.417
You're going to be charged.
Obstruction of justice, arson, espionage.

32:06.133 --> 32:07.498
And the help I gave you?

32:08.093 --> 32:12.337
It will be taken under consideration
at sentencing as a mitigating factor.

32:12.472 --> 32:13.758
Walk over to the door.

32:19.855 --> 32:20.845
Hannah.

32:27.154 --> 32:28.440
I'm sorry.

32:30.031 --> 32:31.157
| have a question.

32:33.368 --> 32:36.360
That day on the bridge,
were you reaching for a gun?

32:39.875 --> 32:40.865
No.

32:43.211 --> 32:44.542
Then what was it?

32:45.755 --> 32:47.462
[chuckles softly]

32:48.800 --> 32:51.132
| guess it doesn't matter now, does it?

32:56.516 --> 32:58.132
No, I guess not.

32:58.977 --> 32:59.967
[door buzzes]

33:14.493 --> 33:16.905
[news anchor]
After the successful launch of Equis Two,

33:17.037 --> 33:19.529
rescue is at hand
for the crippled space station.

33:19.664 --> 33:23.532
And with it, much-needed water
for the four astronauts aboard.

33:23.668 --> 33:25.875
One hour till we dock, Mr. President.

33:26.755 --> 33:30.419
Yes. I'm very grateful
that you agreed to cooperate.

33:30.550 --> 33:33.713
Hmm. We are all made of stardust.

33:33.845 --> 33:36.507
Space is our past and our future.

33:36.640 --> 33:40.383
-We have no choice but to cooperate.
- I couldn't agree with you more.

33:41.353 --> 33:43.765
Which is why I appreciate your concession.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.013
My concession?

33:46.566 --> 33:49.649
Yes. I know it must have been difficult.

33:49.778 --> 33:54.147
But agreeing to turn the page
and move past trivial issues,

33:54.282 --> 33:56.990
it was the right thing, Mr. President.

33:57.118 --> 33:58.404
Mr. Ambassador.

34:00.956 --> 34:03.243
-Emily...
-I'll get Secretary Moss immediately.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.285
Thank you.

34:04.417 --> 34:06.670
[news anchor] ...report that we are
not out of the woods yet.

34:07.295 --> 34:08.251
Thank you.

34:09.130 --> 34:10.416
Mr. President.

34:10.549 --> 34:13.507
Did you cut a deal with Ambassador Pavlov
without consulting me?

34:13.635 --> 34:16.342
-I wouldn't call it a deal, sir.
-What would you call it?

34:16.471 --> 34:21.306
An accommodation to save lives and
the space program we care so much about.

34:21.434 --> 34:22.514
What did you promise?

34:22.643 --> 34:26.853
Our country won't look into Russian
involvement with the Icarus investigation.

34:26.982 --> 34:29.440
-On whose authority?
-On yours, sir.

34:29.568 --> 34:32.936
Turning the page is in your
best interest, and the country's.

34:33.071 --> 34:35.779
The Icarus investigation is
responsible for my wife's death.

34:35.907 --> 34:38.023
You can't use that as a bargaining chip.

34:38.159 --> 34:41.025
-You told me to get it done.
-Not at any cost.

34:41.161 --> 34:42.447
Let's talk about cost, shall we?

34:42.581 --> 34:45.369
The cost of recent events.
The cost on you.

34:45.500 --> 34:48.993
-Be very careful here, Cornelius.
-I'm trying to make a point, sir.

34:50.170 --> 34:52.958
When Elaine died,
| decided not to run for another term.

34:54.342 --> 34:57.801
-You haven't taken a day off. Not one.
-That decision is mine to make.

34:57.929 --> 35:00.421
It's the wrong decision for the country.

35:01.516 --> 35:05.555
Look, I've had a bird's-eye view
of things for the last three months.

35:05.687 --> 35:08.019
And I haven't liked what I've seen.

35:08.148 --> 35:12.437
The indecision, the overcaution.
The missteps just keep growing.

35:12.569 --> 35:13.855
For example?

35:13.987 --> 35:17.150
For example,
you pushed off the Arab-Israeli summit.

35:17.282 --> 35:19.899
You withdrew your budget initiative
to tinker with it.

35:20.035 --> 35:24.154
Bills you should have signed have stayed on
your desk until they became pocket vetoes.

35:24.289 --> 35:26.872
| didn't know
we had so many political differences.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.368
It's not politics. It's leadership.

35:30.503 --> 35:32.414
You zig when you should zag.

35:32.547 --> 35:37.758
And I'm tired of cleaning up your mess,
of giving assurances to get things done.

35:37.886 --> 35:39.968
Assurances you should've given.

35:40.096 --> 35:43.009
Your unauthorized back-channeling
has been going on for quite some time?

35:43.141 --> 35:45.132
-Tom--
-I asked you a question.

35:45.852 --> 35:47.559
[sighs deeply]

35:49.731 --> 35:52.689
You sit in that chair,
you have an obligation.

35:52.817 --> 35:56.401
Not just to the American people,
but to the office.

35:56.529 --> 35:58.816
To every president
who sat there before you.

35:58.948 --> 36:00.234
And will sit there after you.

36:01.409 --> 36:05.573
Your judgment is off, Tom.
And I can't let you implode. I won't.

36:06.331 --> 36:08.618
Cornelius, you've provided me
with sound counsel.

36:08.750 --> 36:12.243
And I've considered you to be a friend.
But I've returned that favor.

36:12.379 --> 36:14.962
When you interfered in that Thorn
investigation, I stood by you.

36:15.090 --> 36:17.752
| know that, sir.
And I will be eternally grateful.

36:17.884 --> 36:21.878
But I think with perspective, you will see
that I have been standing by you.

36:22.013 --> 36:26.052
No, sir. You have been standing behind me
undermining my authority,

36:26.184 --> 36:30.052
which is something I cannot excuse
regardless of your intentions.

36:31.898 --> 36:34.686
Your services are no longer required.

36:38.446 --> 36:39.607
That's all.

36:55.964 --> 36:57.375
[sighs]

37:02.595 --> 37:05.587
You can't fire a former president
and not expect media backlash.

37:05.724 --> 37:08.466
Especially one
with a formidable PR machine.

37:08.601 --> 37:11.093
Sir, Moss is going to play
the victim card.

37:11.229 --> 37:13.140
Which is why you need to go on the offensive.

37:13.273 --> 37:15.765
-I won't throw him under the bus.
-[Lyor] No, sir.

37:15.900 --> 37:18.608
That would be calling him out
on his treachery.

37:18.737 --> 37:21.525
We recommend citing
irreconcilable policy differences.

37:21.656 --> 37:23.988
Which is code
for throwing him under the bus.

37:24.117 --> 37:25.699
Genteel code.

37:25.827 --> 37:27.693
Seth, I want you to prepare a statement.

37:27.829 --> 37:32.164
"It is with great reluctance that
| accepted Secretary Moss's resignation.

37:32.292 --> 37:34.750
He came out of retirement at my request

37:34.878 --> 37:37.996
in an effort to help our country
through an incredibly difficult time.

37:38.131 --> 37:41.465
His task complete,
he has chosen to return to private life

37:41.593 --> 37:45.461
to the thanks of a grateful nation.
And he will be deeply missed.”

37:46.139 --> 37:47.004
Yes, sir.

37:47.640 --> 37:48.926
-That works, too.
-[door opens]

37:50.018 --> 37:52.510
-[Mike] They're ready for you in Command Ops.
-Thank you.

37:55.482 --> 37:57.519
[speaking Russian]

37:58.359 --> 38:01.647
[in English] Copy, Moscow.
Distance 30 meters. Rate 0.12.

38:01.780 --> 38:05.193
-Thank you for everything you've done.
-You're welcome, sir.

38:05.325 --> 38:07.111
There's nowhere else I'd rather be.

38:10.538 --> 38:11.403
[dynamics officer] Copy.

38:11.539 --> 38:14.372
[flight controller]
Flight, rate nominal, trajectory nominal.

38:15.293 --> 38:19.878
Docking port clear.
No obstruction, we're right on the line.

38:20.006 --> 38:23.419
Crosshairs look good. No bias, no drift.

38:23.551 --> 38:25.588
Flight, we are go for capture.

38:25.720 --> 38:26.926
RCS firing.

38:27.055 --> 38:29.046
[dynamics officer] Two meters.
Standing by for contact and capture.

38:29.182 --> 38:31.014
[indistinct chatter over radio]

38:31.893 --> 38:33.224
Contact and capture confirmed.

38:33.353 --> 38:35.219
[all applauding and cheering]

38:41.194 --> 38:42.605
Congratulations, Mr. President.

38:42.737 --> 38:44.853
-Thank God it worked.
-Yeah.

38:44.989 --> 38:47.731
-Rick, thank you for everything.
-Happy to serve, sir.

38:49.828 --> 38:50.909
Thank you.

38:51.579 --> 38:56.665
Dr. Frost, I want you to know
that |, uh, forgive you.

38:56.793 --> 38:58.079
For what, Mr. Boone?

39:01.005 --> 39:01.995
You know.

39:06.970 --> 39:10.133
Turkey, white meat only.
Macaroni and cheese.

39:10.265 --> 39:12.552
And lightly braised carrots. [sighs]

39:12.684 --> 39:13.890
Thanks, Dad.

39:14.018 --> 39:16.009
You're very welcome.

39:16.938 --> 39:19.396
| was talking to your principal earlier.

39:19.524 --> 39:22.892
She told me she found out you weren't
the one who started the fight.

39:23.027 --> 39:25.405
That you were just trying to protect a friend.

39:27.448 --> 39:29.064
| don't want anyone to be hurt.

39:31.119 --> 39:32.780
"Cause you were hurt?

39:37.041 --> 39:38.293
Me, too.

39:39.878 --> 39:42.836
You know what? We need a plan.

39:42.964 --> 39:44.625
We need a no-hurt plan.

39:45.300 --> 39:49.419
If either of us is upset about Mommy,
or anything,

39:49.554 --> 39:51.465
we need to tell each other, okay?

39:54.309 --> 39:57.472
You know what I do sometimes
when I'm missing Mommy really badly?

40:00.398 --> 40:04.983
| think about some of the things
she would do that would make me happy,

40:05.111 --> 40:08.069
that would make me smile. Little things.

40:08.823 --> 40:10.063
What kind of things?

40:10.575 --> 40:11.781
| don't know.

40:12.493 --> 40:17.283
[chuckles] The look she would give me
when I would leave my socks on the floor.

40:17.415 --> 40:19.076
-And your underwear.
-[both chuckle]

40:19.208 --> 40:22.166
And my underwear. Okay, your turn.

40:23.463 --> 40:28.253
| like how Mommy's hair
always smelled like sunshine.

40:29.010 --> 40:32.219
-Sunshine doesn't smell like anything, silly.
-Yes, it does.

40:32.347 --> 40:33.553
What's it smell like?

40:33.681 --> 40:35.797
-Mommy's hair.
-[chuckles]

40:40.521 --> 40:41.932
[Kendra] Hey, Rocket Man.

40:42.607 --> 40:43.472
It didn't work.

40:44.150 --> 40:45.185
What didn't work?

40:45.318 --> 40:49.983
My rocket at Poconos Space Academy.
It was a bust.

40:50.114 --> 40:51.275
[Kendra] Looks pretty good to me.

40:51.866 --> 40:55.655
[chuckles] Oh, it launched.
But half the score was the physics.

40:56.704 --> 40:59.241
| found my old camp notebook.

40:59.374 --> 41:02.082
Ran the numbers.

41:02.210 --> 41:04.247
My math didn't compute.

41:04.379 --> 41:06.666
It's okay to come in second, Lyor.

41:09.550 --> 41:10.881
[sighs]

41:11.010 --> 41:13.502
I've been in Command Ops all day.

41:13.638 --> 41:16.221
The conquest of space,

41:16.349 --> 41:20.217
the majesty of human achievement
in all its glory,

41:20.353 --> 41:21.388
and what do I do?

41:23.690 --> 41:28.025
| spin, scheme, strategize.

41:28.152 --> 41:31.270
You advise the president
of the United States.

41:31.406 --> 41:34.023
A man who changes lives
with every stroke of his pen,

41:34.158 --> 41:35.569
with every word he utters.

41:35.702 --> 41:38.911
You help steer the course
of human progress.

41:39.747 --> 41:41.658
That's the math I'd worry about.

41:43.251 --> 41:44.537
My rocket still sucked.

41:44.669 --> 41:46.501
[cell phones chiming]

41:48.172 --> 41:48.923
[sighs]

41:50.800 --> 41:53.417
[Tom] Mr. Beeman, given the circumstances,

41:53.553 --> 41:56.136
would you say your treatment here
has been fair?

41:56.264 --> 41:57.095
Yes, sir.

41:57.223 --> 41:59.715
-That went viral 20 minutes ago.
-How did this get out?

41:59.851 --> 42:02.309
[Tom] Good. Because I want you to remember

42:02.437 --> 42:05.270
every day of your life
what you took from me.

42:05.398 --> 42:07.230
[Lyor] Someone hacked
into the prison system.

42:07.358 --> 42:08.109
[Seth] But how?

42:08.234 --> 42:10.441
| don't know.
But we have to tell the president.
