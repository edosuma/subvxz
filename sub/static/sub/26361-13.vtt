00:04.482 --> 00:06.441
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:06.484 --> 00:08.095
sexually based offenses

00:08.138 --> 00:09.618
are considered
especially heinous.

00:09.661 --> 00:11.663
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:11.707 --> 00:13.491
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:13.535 --> 00:15.145
are members of an elite squad

00:15.189 --> 00:17.060
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:17.104 --> 00:20.629
These are their stories.

00:20.672 --> 00:22.761
- The ambulance is
on its way, sir.

00:22.805 --> 00:25.155
How far apart are
the contractions?

00:25.199 --> 00:27.505
- No, ma'am, that is not
considered an emergency.

00:27.549 --> 00:30.291
You should call
your local precinct.

00:30.334 --> 00:32.684
- 911, what's your emergency?

00:35.600 --> 00:37.689
- Hello?
Are you there?

00:37.733 --> 00:39.648
- A man broke in.

00:39.691 --> 00:41.519
He tried to make me
and my sister have sex.

00:41.563 --> 00:42.694
He's hurting my dad.

00:42.738 --> 00:44.305
- Okay, stay on the line.

00:44.348 --> 00:47.525
I'm showing you at
697 West 140th street.

00:47.569 --> 00:48.787
What apartment?

00:48.831 --> 00:50.441
- 2B.

00:50.485 --> 00:54.271
No--Dad? Oh, my God, help.

00:54.315 --> 00:56.491
- The police are on their way.
- No, Dad. He's got a knife.

00:56.534 --> 00:58.188
- Can you describe
what's happening?

00:58.232 --> 00:59.450
- Don't hurt him!

00:59.494 --> 01:01.365
No, no, no!

01:01.409 --> 01:04.064
Dad!

01:04.107 --> 01:06.283
- Hello?

01:06.327 --> 01:08.285
Hello?

01:11.636 --> 01:13.334
- So what are we looking at,
Detective?

01:13.377 --> 01:14.726
- Male perp was
average height, weight.

01:14.770 --> 01:17.164
Maybe white, maybe black,
in a ski mask.

01:17.207 --> 01:19.296
- What about a doorman?
- Nope, no doorman.

01:21.646 --> 01:23.300
- What about cameras?

01:23.344 --> 01:27.348
- Still checking,
but don't hold your breath.

01:27.391 --> 01:30.307
Victim was stabbed in the
jugular with a kitchen knife.

01:30.351 --> 01:32.135
Perp left the weapon.

01:32.179 --> 01:33.528
- The girls?

01:33.571 --> 01:35.269
- Traumatized, in shock.

01:35.312 --> 01:37.271
They're with a neighbor till
the ambulance arrives.

01:37.314 --> 01:38.750
- There's no mother
in the picture?

01:38.794 --> 01:40.883
- Apparently not.

01:47.542 --> 01:50.153
- They had to see
their father's dead body.

01:50.197 --> 01:51.720
You deal with kids
all the time.

01:51.763 --> 01:53.548
I don't know how you do it.

01:53.591 --> 01:55.463
- Sometimes I don't either.

02:04.472 --> 02:06.778
I'm Lieutenant Benson.
This is Detective Carisi,

02:06.822 --> 02:08.606
Special Victims Unit.

02:08.650 --> 02:10.173
- Greg Callahan.
This is Susan.

02:10.217 --> 02:11.261
- Thank God you're here.

02:11.305 --> 02:12.480
- Oh, the girls
are right there.

02:12.523 --> 02:14.177
I was just trying
to keep them calm.

02:14.221 --> 02:15.787
They're watching TV
and I put a blanket on them.

02:15.831 --> 02:16.875
- Thank you.

02:16.919 --> 02:18.790
- Appreciate it.
Thank you.

02:18.834 --> 02:21.880
- Um, Britney, Laura?

02:21.924 --> 02:24.709
I'm Olivia and this is Sonny,

02:24.753 --> 02:27.843
and we're here to help you.

02:27.886 --> 02:30.324
- You need to help
my little sister.

02:31.716 --> 02:33.414
- We will, honey.
We're gonna--

02:33.457 --> 02:35.329
We're gonna get you
to the hospital

02:35.372 --> 02:37.461
as soon as
the ambulance gets here, okay?

02:37.505 --> 02:41.335
- I just wanna go home
and stay with my daddy.

02:43.424 --> 02:46.166
- Daddy's dead.

02:48.255 --> 02:51.823
Tell her.
He's dead.

03:59.021 --> 04:01.850
- Hey, Liv.

04:01.893 --> 04:03.634
You had a long night.

04:03.678 --> 04:05.549
- Rollins,
you shouldn't be here.

04:05.593 --> 04:07.508
- At this point,
I'm better off at a hospital

04:07.551 --> 04:08.944
than I am at home.

04:08.987 --> 04:10.641
- Any leads?
- There's no sign of this guy.

04:10.685 --> 04:12.426
And the two daughters?

04:14.428 --> 04:17.344
- I don't know how you get over
something like this.

04:18.388 --> 04:20.260
- The rape kits?

04:20.303 --> 04:24.307
- Britney is--is negative,
but Laura has genital trauma.

04:24.351 --> 04:25.917
- Okay, and it's just the two
of them and the father.

04:25.961 --> 04:27.397
- Well, we're checking
with ACS,

04:27.441 --> 04:29.704
but so far,
there's no next of kin,

04:29.747 --> 04:31.271
the grandparents are deceased

04:31.314 --> 04:34.535
and the mother
committed suicide two years.

04:38.974 --> 04:41.542
- That's rough.

04:43.718 --> 04:44.806
- Hi.

04:44.849 --> 04:46.590
- The girls can talk.

04:46.634 --> 04:48.592
Um, as their acting guardian,
I should be in the room.

04:48.636 --> 04:50.028
- Yeah, you know,

04:50.072 --> 04:51.769
if you would just give us
a couple of minutes,

04:51.813 --> 04:53.293
I would so appreciate it.

04:54.642 --> 04:56.687
Thank you.
- Thanks.

04:58.950 --> 05:01.301
- I was doing homework.

05:02.563 --> 05:05.435
I heard this smash.

05:05.479 --> 05:08.873
I looked up and...

05:08.917 --> 05:11.659
there was this man
on the fire escape

05:11.702 --> 05:15.663
and he opened the latch
to the window

05:15.706 --> 05:17.969
and I-I-I screamed
for Britney.

05:18.013 --> 05:19.449
- And where was she?

05:19.493 --> 05:21.756
- She was in her room.

05:21.799 --> 05:24.367
She ran out...

05:24.411 --> 05:26.848
yelling at him to get away,
but...

05:28.415 --> 05:30.504
He was already inside.

05:30.547 --> 05:31.983
- Then what happened?

05:32.027 --> 05:33.811
- He went into the kitchen

05:33.855 --> 05:36.640
and he grabbed a knife...

05:38.555 --> 05:41.558
He put it up to my neck...

05:44.039 --> 05:46.781
And then he said he...

05:46.824 --> 05:49.784
he said he was going to...

05:57.487 --> 06:01.926
- Laura, I know how--
how difficult this is,

06:01.970 --> 06:05.060
but you really need
to tell us what he did.

06:11.153 --> 06:14.635
He--he kissed me...

06:16.593 --> 06:18.987
And he put his fingers
inside me.

06:21.729 --> 06:24.558
And I just--I couldn't move.

06:29.171 --> 06:31.695
And then my dad came home.

06:31.739 --> 06:35.525
- The man started going
towards my dad with a knife,

06:35.569 --> 06:38.093
and my dad told us
to run, so...

06:38.876 --> 06:41.575
We ran into my room
and locked the door.

06:43.185 --> 06:46.797
I should've went out there
and tried to save him.

06:48.582 --> 06:50.932
- What happened next?

06:52.063 --> 06:54.109
- It got quiet.

06:56.459 --> 06:59.419
We opened the door.

06:59.462 --> 07:01.682
And then I saw my dad
on the couch.

07:06.034 --> 07:09.559
And then I tried to over to him
and stop the bleeding, but...

07:11.605 --> 07:14.912
It was--he was already...

07:14.956 --> 07:17.785
Sweetie, I'm so sorry.

07:19.177 --> 07:21.441
- Oh, my God.

07:29.013 --> 07:31.712
- Attend the tale of
Douglas Moore.

07:31.755 --> 07:34.105
Allegedly,
he walks in on the assault,

07:34.149 --> 07:35.585
fights back, gets killed.

07:35.629 --> 07:37.195
- That's what
the daughters told us.

07:37.239 --> 07:39.937
- I have three problems
with that.

07:39.981 --> 07:41.852
Number one,
there's no defensive wounds.

07:41.896 --> 07:43.637
- So he didn't
put up much of a fight?

07:43.680 --> 07:44.638
- If any at all.

07:44.681 --> 07:46.596
Problem number two,

07:46.640 --> 07:47.945
the stab was shallow.

07:47.989 --> 07:49.469
Any adult with wherewithal

07:49.512 --> 07:51.732
would put pressure
on the wound, call 911.

07:51.775 --> 07:53.821
- But he didn't?
- No, he didn't.

07:53.864 --> 07:55.083
He didn't have wherewithal,

07:55.126 --> 07:57.520
which leads me
to problem number three,

07:57.564 --> 07:59.130
I found undigested wine
in his stomach

07:59.174 --> 08:01.611
and a whopping blood
alcohol level.

08:01.655 --> 08:02.960
- So he could've
been passed out.

08:03.004 --> 08:04.788
- At the very least,
extremely drunk.

08:04.832 --> 08:06.703
- Maybe we went to the bar
before he came home.

08:06.747 --> 08:09.663
- Or the daughters aren't
telling us the whole story.

08:11.665 --> 08:13.841
The lab says the wine in
the bottles in the kitchen

08:13.884 --> 08:15.538
matches the wine
in the glass.

08:15.582 --> 08:17.061
- And the saliva from the glass

08:17.105 --> 08:19.890
matches samples taken
from Doug Moore.

08:19.934 --> 08:21.936
- So he was home drinking.

08:21.979 --> 08:23.241
Crap.

08:23.285 --> 08:25.113
- He bled out on the couch,
right?

08:25.156 --> 08:27.550
- Well, he just so happened
to fall straight back

08:27.594 --> 08:28.812
after he was stabbed.

08:28.856 --> 08:30.684
- Or he was already
on the couch.

08:31.989 --> 08:33.948
Crap.

08:33.991 --> 08:35.602
So the perp smashed the window,

08:35.645 --> 08:37.778
undid the latch from
the inside.

08:37.821 --> 08:39.170
- Yeah.

08:56.971 --> 08:58.842
Nope.

08:58.886 --> 09:00.844
Look, the angle from this hole
to where that latch is,

09:00.888 --> 09:02.803
that's not humanly possible.

09:02.846 --> 09:04.282
- Crap.

09:07.329 --> 09:09.200
- Hey, thanks for coming in.

09:09.244 --> 09:11.028
- The girls were
just getting settled.

09:11.072 --> 09:12.639
Do you have a lead on the case?

09:12.682 --> 09:14.989
- We just have to ask you
a few more questions.

09:15.032 --> 09:16.860
- We need to talk to you
alone first.

09:16.904 --> 09:19.863
I have a few more questions
for you.

09:19.907 --> 09:22.866
So, Britney,
the medical examiner told us,

09:22.910 --> 09:26.043
um, something that we're just
trying to figure out.

09:27.088 --> 09:28.829
- What?

09:28.872 --> 09:32.354
- That your dad was pretty
drunk when he was stabbed.

09:34.182 --> 09:37.577
- My dad likes to go to bars.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.796
- Britney, we know he was
drinking at home that night.

09:39.840 --> 09:43.583
- And you told us that
your father came in

09:43.626 --> 09:45.715
and interrupted the man

09:45.759 --> 09:47.674
that was assaulting you
and your sister.

09:48.936 --> 09:50.851
- So now you're calling me
a liar.

09:50.894 --> 09:52.330
- No, no, no, we're not.

09:52.374 --> 09:55.986
We're just--we're just
trying to figure out

09:56.030 --> 09:57.771
exactly what happened.

09:57.814 --> 09:59.381
- Like how the window
got broken.

10:00.948 --> 10:03.298
There's just some things
that don't make sense.

10:06.823 --> 10:08.303
- I don't care.

10:08.346 --> 10:10.740
You know why?
'cause my father's dead.

10:10.784 --> 10:13.613
Okay, my father is dead.

10:13.656 --> 10:15.092
So I-I don't really understand

10:15.136 --> 10:17.355
what difference it makes
who killed him.

10:20.315 --> 10:23.840
- Okay, if somebody else was
in that apartment,

10:23.884 --> 10:27.714
if--if things happened
differently...

10:27.757 --> 10:29.672
Listen, you're not in trouble.

10:29.716 --> 10:32.980
- Britney, I can see that
you're an honest person,

10:33.023 --> 10:36.940
but if you're trying
to protect someone

10:36.984 --> 10:40.944
or you're afraid of someone...

10:40.988 --> 10:42.859
we can help you.

10:47.734 --> 10:51.172
- Nobody can help me.

10:51.215 --> 10:52.913
- What does that mean, honey?

10:55.306 --> 10:58.309
- I had to.

10:58.353 --> 11:00.137
- You had to what?

11:02.270 --> 11:05.273
- I had to protect my sister

11:05.316 --> 11:07.971
from my own father.

11:08.015 --> 11:11.714
My own father was
raping my sister.

11:15.805 --> 11:18.982
I had to kill him.

11:36.826 --> 11:39.873
- Britney,
this is Alexis Farrow.

11:39.916 --> 11:41.526
Here, Alexis,
why don't you have a seat?

11:41.570 --> 11:43.920
- Thanks.

11:43.964 --> 11:46.053
Any questions
you're uncomfortable with,

11:46.096 --> 11:47.837
check with me first, okay?

11:54.017 --> 11:57.281
- When did Laura first tell you
she was being abused?

11:58.065 --> 12:00.284
- A few weeks ago.

12:00.328 --> 12:02.983
We usually come home
from school together,

12:03.026 --> 12:07.291
except for Thursdays
'cause I have band practice.

12:07.335 --> 12:10.947
So that Thursday,
I came home

12:10.991 --> 12:13.907
and the bathroom door
was locked

12:13.950 --> 12:18.781
and I heard
her inside crying, so...

12:18.825 --> 12:22.350
I told her that she had
to tell me what was wrong.

12:22.393 --> 12:24.787
- What did she say?

12:24.831 --> 12:28.182
- It started after New Year's.

12:28.225 --> 12:30.358
January.

12:30.401 --> 12:34.841
It was only a few times
on Thursdays.

12:37.495 --> 12:39.584
Before Britney came home.

12:39.628 --> 12:42.457
- Laura told me that
when he was drunk,

12:42.500 --> 12:46.113
he would go into her room
at night.

12:46.156 --> 12:48.463
- We'd lay on the couch,

12:48.506 --> 12:50.595
he'd unzip his pants...

12:52.989 --> 12:57.211
Then he'd put his penis
inside me.

13:00.518 --> 13:02.303
It hurt,

13:02.346 --> 13:05.915
but he said that's what people
who love each other do.

13:07.874 --> 13:09.527
I never should've told Britney.

13:09.571 --> 13:11.965
I didn't want him to die.

13:12.008 --> 13:14.968
- And did you tell
anybody else about this?

13:15.011 --> 13:17.187
- I-I told Britney.

13:17.231 --> 13:19.233
- We know you told Britney.

13:19.276 --> 13:23.063
But did you tell anybody else?

13:25.021 --> 13:27.458
And, Laura,
it's really important

13:27.502 --> 13:30.026
that you tell the truth
right now, okay?

13:32.637 --> 13:35.597
- Ask Greg.
He--he knows.

13:36.903 --> 13:39.035
- Greg, your neighbor?

13:39.079 --> 13:40.863
You told him?

13:40.907 --> 13:43.170
- Yeah, I-I tried to tell him.

13:43.213 --> 13:45.085
- Do you remember when
you talked to him?

13:45.128 --> 13:49.219
Uh, after New Year's.

13:50.655 --> 13:52.875
Sunday.

13:57.401 --> 13:59.012
- What's going to happen
to them now?

13:59.055 --> 14:00.622
- Uh, the girls will spend
the night in custody

14:00.665 --> 14:02.232
at the ACS facility.

14:02.276 --> 14:04.104
I'm assuming,
given the circumstances,

14:04.147 --> 14:06.106
the DA will be open
to a plea.

14:06.149 --> 14:08.238
- Okay, we'll be in touch.

14:09.631 --> 14:10.893
- So now what?

14:10.937 --> 14:13.678
- We vet the story.

14:13.722 --> 14:16.986
Laura told us that she tried
to disclose to the neighbor,

14:17.030 --> 14:18.161
Greg Callahan.

14:18.205 --> 14:19.554
- We met that guy.
We'll follow up.

14:19.597 --> 14:21.208
- And I'll have the lab run
the father's DNA

14:21.251 --> 14:22.644
against Laura's rape kit.

14:22.687 --> 14:24.211
- And check the bed sheets,
the towels,

14:24.254 --> 14:26.213
and the clothes in the hamper.

14:31.131 --> 14:33.655
- What's your relationship
to the girls?

14:33.698 --> 14:36.179
- I met them two years ago.

14:36.223 --> 14:39.052
I didn't exactly want
two teenagers hanging around,

14:39.095 --> 14:43.404
but Doug worked long hours
and they seemed lonely,

14:43.447 --> 14:45.972
and I work from home mostly,
so it wasn't that big a deal.

14:46.015 --> 14:48.931
- Laura ever say anything
about Doug?

14:48.975 --> 14:51.064
- She'd get pissed at him.

14:51.107 --> 14:52.979
When he wouldn't let
her watch TV,

14:53.022 --> 14:54.676
play on her phone,
stuff like that.

14:54.719 --> 14:56.591
Why?

14:56.634 --> 15:00.682
- Laura alleges she was
sexually abused by her father.

15:02.075 --> 15:04.729
- What?

15:04.773 --> 15:07.732
Oh, my God.
Are you sure?

15:07.776 --> 15:12.172
D-Doug wasn't around a lot.
He drank, but...

15:12.215 --> 15:13.956
he--he loved those girls.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.263
- Do you remember
the Sunday after New Year's?

15:16.306 --> 15:18.352
Laura told us that she--
she came over here.

15:18.395 --> 15:20.571
- Yeah, yeah, that's right.

15:20.615 --> 15:22.965
Um...

15:23.009 --> 15:26.969
she said Doug was hungover and
Britney had been sleeping in.

15:27.013 --> 15:28.449
She seemed upset, but--

15:28.492 --> 15:30.103
- What'd she say
to you exactly?

15:31.495 --> 15:36.457
- She said that
she was mad at her dad

15:36.500 --> 15:39.764
and that she didn't want
to live at home anymore.

15:45.335 --> 15:48.382
Was that what she
was trying to tell me?

15:49.209 --> 15:50.384
Oh, my God.

15:50.427 --> 15:51.994
- Did, uh, did Britney
and Laura

15:52.038 --> 15:53.648
ever say anything
more specific?

15:53.691 --> 15:56.607
- No, no, I would've gone
straight to the cops.

15:58.174 --> 16:01.351
You really think that he...

16:01.395 --> 16:04.050
I can't believe it.

16:04.093 --> 16:05.747
I feel sick.

16:10.621 --> 16:12.754
- DA is not interested in
charging Britney as an adult.

16:12.797 --> 16:15.104
I'm gonna contact Corporation
Counsel, talk plea.

16:15.148 --> 16:17.150
- Okay, the neighbor
did confirm that Laura

16:17.193 --> 16:20.501
went over to his apartment
that Sunday and she was upset.

16:20.544 --> 16:22.633
- Any physical evidence?
- Not from the rape kit,

16:22.677 --> 16:25.549
but Doug's DNA was
all over the girls' rooms.

16:25.593 --> 16:27.160
- He's their father.

16:27.203 --> 16:29.031
He's not here to tell us
his side of the story.

16:29.075 --> 16:30.685
Is there any inheritance
in play here?

16:30.728 --> 16:31.686
Life insurance?

16:31.729 --> 16:33.340
- Not that we found so far.

16:33.383 --> 16:35.255
I mean, we're trying
to untangle his personal

16:35.298 --> 16:36.517
and his legal affairs,

16:36.560 --> 16:37.735
find the next of kin.

16:37.779 --> 16:39.215
We don't even know
if he has a will.

16:39.259 --> 16:41.304
- Sergeant Tutuola's here
to see you.

16:41.348 --> 16:43.437
- Fin, everything okay?

16:43.480 --> 16:45.526
- We just heard back from
Doug Moore's boss.

16:45.569 --> 16:47.397
They had a staff meeting
every Thursday

16:47.441 --> 16:48.703
from 3:00 to 6:00.

16:48.746 --> 16:50.705
Doug led it.
He never missed one.

16:51.749 --> 16:53.447
- So he couldn't have been home

16:53.490 --> 16:55.753
sexually abusing
his 13-year-old daughter.

17:00.454 --> 17:03.718
- Who puts chickpeas
in tuna salad?

17:03.761 --> 17:06.068
- You want me to get you
something else?

17:06.112 --> 17:08.853
- No.
No, I'm not hungry, I guess.

17:10.420 --> 17:11.726
Ugh.

17:15.121 --> 17:17.471
- Hey, what's up, Lieu?

17:17.514 --> 17:20.691
Okay, I got it.
I'm on it.

17:20.735 --> 17:23.433
So Liv wants us to bring
Britney and Laura back.

17:23.477 --> 17:25.305
We got to go over
the story again.

17:25.348 --> 17:27.568
Hey, are you--are you okay?

17:28.395 --> 17:31.746
- Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm...

17:31.789 --> 17:34.531
I'm going into labor.

17:36.403 --> 17:37.708
I feel a little light-headed.

17:37.752 --> 17:39.580
- That's normal.
You're going to have a baby.

17:39.623 --> 17:41.234
You're doing great,
Amanda,

17:41.277 --> 17:43.192
but you've got plenty of time,
so don't worry.

17:43.236 --> 17:44.237
How are you holding up, Papa?

17:44.280 --> 17:45.586
- Oh--oh, no, I'm not the--

17:45.629 --> 17:47.327
- Doctor, they need you
in 10-17.

17:47.370 --> 17:48.589
We don't have a room
for you yet,

17:48.632 --> 17:50.460
so just give us
a few minutes.

17:50.504 --> 17:53.376
- Uh, what about the epidural?

17:53.420 --> 17:55.248
Or a lobotomy.

17:58.642 --> 17:59.643
Oh.

17:59.687 --> 18:01.732
- You're doing okay.

18:03.821 --> 18:07.303
Just don't leave me.

18:08.652 --> 18:10.219
- I'm not going anywhere.

18:13.222 --> 18:14.658
- Amanda?

18:14.702 --> 18:16.182
- Al, what--what are you
doing here?

18:16.225 --> 18:17.618
- The hospital called.

18:17.661 --> 18:19.576
You--you--you go into labor
and you don't tell me?

18:19.620 --> 18:21.274
- Oh, well--
- Things happened pretty fast.

18:21.317 --> 18:22.666
- Yeah, sure.

18:22.710 --> 18:24.277
Thank you for being here.
Carisi, right?

18:24.320 --> 18:26.279
- Yeah, that's right.
- I appreciate it.

18:26.322 --> 18:27.584
- Don't mention it.

18:27.628 --> 18:29.369
- I just wanna--
take a deep breath.

18:29.412 --> 18:31.284
- Good idea, but we might not
have a whole lot of time.

18:31.327 --> 18:32.894
Second babies
can be a surprise.

18:32.937 --> 18:34.809
- Thanks, Al.
- Uh, in fact,

18:34.852 --> 18:36.506
better safe than sorry.

18:36.550 --> 18:39.161
Um, uh...

18:39.683 --> 18:41.642
let's see, uh...

18:41.685 --> 18:43.644
Hmm.

18:43.687 --> 18:46.603
Uh, huh.

18:48.518 --> 18:50.433
This is not exactly how I saw
this happening.

18:50.477 --> 18:52.305
But, uh...

18:52.348 --> 18:54.568
before the baby comes,

18:54.611 --> 18:56.222
I would like to make you
an honest woman.

19:00.704 --> 19:02.619
- No, that's, uh--that's okay.

19:02.663 --> 19:04.926
No, the--no, no, no, no.
It's--it's okay.

19:04.969 --> 19:06.754
- I should go.
- No, no, stay.

19:06.797 --> 19:08.277
- No, no, no, no.
Stay, stay.

19:08.321 --> 19:10.497
I want the whole world
to hear this.

19:10.540 --> 19:14.588
Amanda,
we created a life together.

19:14.631 --> 19:16.764
Now it is my greatest wish

19:16.807 --> 19:19.810
that you, me, Jesse, Frannie,

19:19.854 --> 19:23.814
and Baby Pollack
create a family together.

19:30.038 --> 19:32.780
Amanda Rollins,

19:32.823 --> 19:35.826
will you marry me?

19:53.235 --> 19:55.150
- Rollins is fine.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.021
Turns out the baby's
not coming any time soon.

19:57.065 --> 19:58.458
- She's not in labor.
- Not yet.

19:58.501 --> 20:00.677
They're keeping her at
the hospital for observation.

20:00.721 --> 20:02.070
Carisi's there and Dr. Al.

20:02.113 --> 20:04.028
What could possibly go wrong?

20:04.072 --> 20:05.334
- Dr. Al proposed.

20:05.378 --> 20:06.857
- What?

20:06.901 --> 20:09.251
- She said
she'll think about it.

20:09.295 --> 20:11.297
- Wow.

20:11.340 --> 20:13.864
Wow, um...

20:13.908 --> 20:17.346
Okay, so, uh, where are we on
talking to Laura and Britney?

20:17.390 --> 20:19.174
- Actually, nowhere.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.698
Their new lawyer says
no more questions.

20:21.742 --> 20:23.483
- What, why?

20:23.526 --> 20:26.181
- Well, it turns out Doug Moore
did have Deed of Guardianship.

20:26.225 --> 20:29.402
He named Greg Callahan
the girls' legal guardian.

20:33.884 --> 20:35.973
- Mr. Callahan,
our investigators show

20:36.017 --> 20:37.801
a clean background.

20:37.845 --> 20:40.195
We have statements
from Britney and Laura Moore

20:40.239 --> 20:43.242
confirming that they wish
to stay with you.

20:43.285 --> 20:45.069
- Thank you, Your Honor.

20:45.113 --> 20:47.115
- The circumstances
are atypical,

20:47.158 --> 20:49.770
but given the girls' situation
and their father's wishes,

20:49.813 --> 20:52.163
I grant a provisional
Order of Guardianship

20:52.207 --> 20:54.818
while the court completes
its investigation.

20:56.820 --> 20:58.779
- Thanks.
- I'll be right back.

21:00.868 --> 21:02.913
- Greg.

21:02.957 --> 21:04.915
- Oh, hey, Sergeant,

21:04.959 --> 21:06.395
you must be as shocked as I am.

21:06.439 --> 21:08.528
I just heard
from Doug's lawyer yesterday.

21:08.571 --> 21:09.920
- You didn't mention it.

21:09.964 --> 21:12.183
- No, I got the call
after you left.

21:12.227 --> 21:15.099
I just wanted to get those
girls out of this ACS facility

21:15.143 --> 21:16.492
as soon as possible.

21:16.536 --> 21:18.189
- You're taking on
two teenage girls, man.

21:18.233 --> 21:20.409
That's not something
I'd want to try to do.

21:20.453 --> 21:23.499
- Yeah, believe me,
it is the last thing I need,

21:23.543 --> 21:26.415
but ACS told me the next step
would be foster care

21:26.459 --> 21:28.330
or going to strangers.

21:28.374 --> 21:30.332
I--I just can't let that happen
to them, you know?

21:30.376 --> 21:32.116
- Look, I admire what you're
doing,

21:32.160 --> 21:34.162
but we still need to talk
to Britney and Laura.

21:34.205 --> 21:36.251
- Yeah, I know,
ACS mentioned that,

21:36.295 --> 21:38.340
but I was being told that
Britney was being charged

21:38.384 --> 21:40.560
as a juvenile and--
and taking a plea.

21:40.603 --> 21:42.518
Uh, the killing was justified
given what happened.

21:42.562 --> 21:44.433
- Look, is everything
all right here?

21:44.477 --> 21:46.914
I'm Avi Meyer,
Mr. Callahan's attorney.

21:46.957 --> 21:48.350
- I'm Sergeant Tutuola,

21:48.394 --> 21:50.309
I'm investigating
Doug Moore's murder.

21:50.352 --> 21:53.007
- They just want to
question the girls,

21:53.050 --> 21:56.271
but Doug told me he wanted me
to look after them.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.968
- Yeah, let me be
the bad guy here, Greg.

21:58.012 --> 22:01.145
The girls are now wards
in Mr. Callahan's care.

22:01.189 --> 22:03.974
He reserves the right
to decline a police interview.

22:10.851 --> 22:12.287
- Is the lawyer right?

22:12.331 --> 22:14.202
- Yeah, we can't talk
to the girls

22:14.245 --> 22:15.899
without their guardian's
consent.

22:15.943 --> 22:18.293
- Okay, they may have plotted
to murder their father.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.121
- Greg Callahan's involved.

22:20.164 --> 22:22.297
Is anybody still buying
his "nice-guy-next-door" act?

22:22.341 --> 22:24.560
- Any evidence
to indicate otherwise?

22:24.604 --> 22:27.346
- The only ones who can
tell us more are the girls,

22:27.389 --> 22:30.827
who we can't talk to as long
as he's their legal guardian.

22:30.871 --> 22:32.612
- So what you need to do
is find a way

22:32.655 --> 22:34.353
to challenge
the guardianship itself.

22:39.096 --> 22:41.490
- I went through the document
looking for red flags.

22:41.534 --> 22:43.187
Check this out.

22:43.231 --> 22:44.580
Britney's middle name
is Katherine.

22:44.624 --> 22:47.975
It's spelled K-A-T-H-E-R-I-N-E.

22:48.018 --> 22:50.412
All right, look at
her birth certificate.

22:53.415 --> 22:55.199
- Cathryn with a C and a Y.

22:55.243 --> 22:57.158
- Even bad parents know how
to spell

22:57.201 --> 22:58.507
their child's middle name.

22:58.551 --> 23:00.553
- Doug didn't fill out
that deed.

23:04.339 --> 23:06.254
- Salt of the earth,
Doug Moore.

23:06.297 --> 23:08.256
I was horrified to hear
he'd been killed.

23:09.910 --> 23:13.261
- Um, how--how long were you
his attorney?

23:13.304 --> 23:15.045
- Huh?
Uh, a couple of months.

23:15.089 --> 23:17.396
Oh, God, such a nice guy.

23:17.439 --> 23:19.659
You know, most clients
do things by email nowadays,

23:19.702 --> 23:21.095
but...

23:21.138 --> 23:22.270
- He used to come
in here himself?

23:22.313 --> 23:23.532
- Uh, yeah.
Several times.

23:23.576 --> 23:25.229
Yeah, we talked about
his wife's passing

23:25.273 --> 23:26.579
and how he had to get
his affairs in order

23:26.622 --> 23:28.494
for his daughters, you know?

23:31.279 --> 23:33.455
- Is that him?

23:33.499 --> 23:35.501
- Who's that?
- Doug Moore.

23:35.544 --> 23:37.459
- No, it's not.

23:40.201 --> 23:41.332
- What about him?

23:41.376 --> 23:43.030
- That's Doug Moore.

23:44.031 --> 23:46.250
- That's the guy who signed
the Deed of Guardianship?

23:46.294 --> 23:47.556
- That's right.

23:47.600 --> 23:49.428
- Does this guy not look
a little young to be

23:49.471 --> 23:51.560
a 50-something father with
two teenage daughters to you?

23:51.604 --> 23:55.434
- Well, he had a photo ID
and he had his daughter's IDs.

23:55.477 --> 23:57.087
He paid with a credit card.

23:57.131 --> 24:00.221
What--why would somebody lie
about that?

24:02.745 --> 24:05.095
- Why are we doing it this way?
The girls are getting scared.

24:05.139 --> 24:06.357
- You should be scared.

24:06.401 --> 24:07.707
- I don't understand.
We just got here.

24:07.750 --> 24:09.012
- I know,
I'm sorry, Laura,

24:09.056 --> 24:10.449
but we have to take you back.

24:10.492 --> 24:12.233
- Laura, take your coat.
- Look, I can explain.

24:12.276 --> 24:13.582
- Let's go, man.

24:13.626 --> 24:15.366
Don't make me cuff you
in front of these girls.

24:15.410 --> 24:17.151
- Just let me get my jacket.

24:17.194 --> 24:19.022
- What is happening?
- Just call my lawyer.

24:19.066 --> 24:20.546
Have him meet me.

24:20.589 --> 24:22.025
- Laura.

24:22.069 --> 24:23.331
- Hey.
- Greg,

24:23.374 --> 24:24.593
please--please don't
let them take us.

24:24.637 --> 24:26.290
- We're gonna get it
all figured out, okay?

24:26.334 --> 24:27.509
- Let her go, let her go.
- Laura, come on.

24:27.553 --> 24:29.337
We got to go now.

24:29.380 --> 24:31.295
- Stop! I'm not going!
- Laura, it's going to be okay.

24:31.339 --> 24:33.950
- Greg! I love him!

24:33.994 --> 24:35.691
- Okay?
- I'm staying!

24:38.520 --> 24:41.436
Greg, tell them.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.438
Please.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.614
- Come on, honey.
We have to go now.

24:45.658 --> 24:47.486
- Greg.
- We have to go, honey.

24:47.529 --> 24:50.314
Come, come, come.
Come, come, come.

24:50.358 --> 24:52.273
- Come on.

24:58.801 --> 25:01.674
- Uh, tell Liv if she needs me,
though, I can FaceTime in.

25:01.717 --> 25:04.851
I-I know I'm having a baby,
Carisi.

25:04.894 --> 25:07.549
I don't think the baby
knows that yet.

25:09.420 --> 25:10.726
Are you telling me what to do?

25:10.770 --> 25:13.207
Okay.
Okay then.

25:13.250 --> 25:16.427
Bye.

25:16.471 --> 25:19.561
They really could use me
on this case.

25:19.605 --> 25:22.477
Man, I need to get back
to work.

25:22.521 --> 25:25.349
What?

25:25.393 --> 25:26.873
- I guess I was kinda hoping
you might take

25:26.916 --> 25:30.790
a nice, long maternity leave
or even quit.

25:31.660 --> 25:33.880
- Quit my job?

25:33.923 --> 25:36.709
I love my job.

25:36.752 --> 25:39.320
- Amanda...

25:41.714 --> 25:43.977
I want to take care of you.

25:46.457 --> 25:49.286
- I know you do.

25:49.330 --> 25:51.550
Um...

25:53.464 --> 25:56.337
The thing is, Al,
I can't marry you.

25:57.947 --> 25:59.688
- Why not?

26:02.865 --> 26:04.954
- I don't love you.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.937
- Okay.

26:30.980 --> 26:32.982
- Okay?

26:34.680 --> 26:36.943
- I'm disappointed,

26:36.986 --> 26:39.902
but one of the only good things
about getting older

26:39.946 --> 26:41.861
is that you get used to it.

26:45.821 --> 26:47.780
I'm glad I met you, Amanda,

26:47.823 --> 26:49.390
that we made a baby together.

26:49.433 --> 26:51.871
Um, I'll always be grateful.

26:58.791 --> 27:01.097
Thank you, Al.

27:01.141 --> 27:03.796
Thank you.

27:03.839 --> 27:06.494
- Now let's
have this kid already.

27:06.537 --> 27:08.365
What do you say?

27:14.720 --> 27:16.983
- You lied to those girls.
You lied to the court.

27:17.026 --> 27:18.680
Did you think you could
get away with that?

27:18.724 --> 27:20.900
- My client admits that
he's guilty of fraud,

27:20.943 --> 27:23.990
but there were
compelling reasons.

27:24.033 --> 27:25.121
- We're all ears.

27:25.165 --> 27:26.819
- I had to forge the document.

27:26.862 --> 27:28.124
On New Year's Day,

27:28.168 --> 27:29.778
Douglas told me
he was gonna kill himself.

27:29.822 --> 27:30.997
- You have proof of that?

27:31.040 --> 27:32.476
- No, but I believed him.

27:32.520 --> 27:33.652
He--he'd been
drinking heavily.

27:33.695 --> 27:34.957
He was depressed.

27:35.001 --> 27:37.917
- So you're a psychiatrist now.

27:37.960 --> 27:39.919
- He--he'd say things like,

27:39.962 --> 27:42.530
"My wife figured out
an exit strategy,"

27:42.573 --> 27:44.010
and now in hindsight

27:44.053 --> 27:45.707
with what he was doing
to Laura,

27:45.751 --> 27:48.492
he was obviously
consumed with guilt.

27:48.536 --> 27:49.842
I tried to get him help.

27:49.885 --> 27:51.408
- Okay.

27:51.452 --> 27:53.889
Tried, uh, how exactly?

27:53.933 --> 27:57.066
- I begged him
to get counseling,

27:57.110 --> 27:59.416
to think of his daughters,

27:59.460 --> 28:01.897
but he was dead set
on his plan.

28:01.941 --> 28:03.682
I couldn't stand the idea

28:03.725 --> 28:05.466
of the girls going into
the foster care system.

28:05.509 --> 28:06.728
- Well, guess what?

28:06.772 --> 28:08.904
You made things a lot worse
for them.

28:10.036 --> 28:13.561
- Look, Britney and Laura
want to be with me.

28:13.604 --> 28:16.564
Britney is almost 16.
She can decide for herself.

28:16.607 --> 28:18.740
- Did you know Britney
was going to kill her father?

28:18.784 --> 28:21.482
- No, I swear to God!

28:21.525 --> 28:23.702
- What's up with Laura?
She said she loves you.

28:23.745 --> 28:25.747
What's that all about?

28:25.791 --> 28:28.750
- She loves me like
a big brother

28:28.794 --> 28:30.839
or an uncle.

28:30.883 --> 28:33.755
It's not romantic.
That is ridiculous.

28:33.799 --> 28:36.715
- Not from where
we're sitting, it's not.

28:38.064 --> 28:40.631
- If anything, it was a--
a schoolgirl crush.

28:42.068 --> 28:44.418
I'm in love with my girlfriend.
You can ask her.

28:44.461 --> 28:45.854
- We will,

28:45.898 --> 28:48.596
while you're getting arraigned
for fraud, forgery,

28:48.639 --> 28:51.599
kidnapping,
and endangering a minor.

29:01.130 --> 29:02.784
Stone says that he can

29:02.828 --> 29:05.787
charge kidnapping,
but unless the girls testify,

29:05.831 --> 29:07.528
it's gonna be tough to convict.

29:07.571 --> 29:09.051
- So this guy does a year
for forgery? Come on.

29:09.095 --> 29:10.792
He had something
to do with this murder.

29:10.836 --> 29:12.794
We got to talk to Britney.
We got to talk to Laura again.

29:12.838 --> 29:14.143
- They won't turn on him.

29:14.187 --> 29:15.884
He's probably been grooming
them for years.

29:15.928 --> 29:18.234
- So get me evidence of that.

29:20.236 --> 29:23.152
- What you're doing to Greg,
it's just not right.

29:23.196 --> 29:25.067
- He committed
forgery and perjury.

29:25.111 --> 29:27.069
- He had to.

29:27.113 --> 29:28.984
When he told me what Doug
was doing to Laura--

29:29.028 --> 29:31.813
- Hold on.
When did he tell you that?

29:31.857 --> 29:32.988
- A few weeks ago.

29:33.032 --> 29:34.642
- And you didn't go
to the police?

29:34.685 --> 29:35.991
- Greg was trying to get proof

29:36.035 --> 29:37.819
to make sure Doug
would go to prison.

29:37.863 --> 29:40.256
- How long have you two
been involved?

29:40.300 --> 29:43.956
- Uh, almost a year?

29:46.785 --> 29:50.484
We talked about me moving in,
but now with the girls, it's...

29:50.527 --> 29:52.094
it's not a good time.

29:52.138 --> 29:54.836
- Huh.

29:54.880 --> 29:57.230
- They need him.
- That's what Greg told you?

29:57.273 --> 29:59.058
- That's what I know.

29:59.101 --> 30:02.496
He's been there for them,
more than their own father.

30:02.539 --> 30:05.847
He made them dinner,
listened to their problems,

30:05.891 --> 30:08.502
helped them with school,
uh, exposed them to art,

30:08.545 --> 30:09.677
music, literature.

30:09.720 --> 30:10.852
- I'm sure he's a great tutor.

30:10.896 --> 30:12.636
- He is!

30:12.680 --> 30:15.074
Greg and Laura are reading
Shakespeare together.

30:20.209 --> 30:22.168
- "Romeo and Juliet"?

30:22.211 --> 30:24.126
- Sure.

30:24.170 --> 30:27.129
- "From Romeo to my Juliet."

30:27.173 --> 30:29.566
Did Greg write this?

30:33.657 --> 30:35.094
- So what if he did?

30:39.359 --> 30:40.882
- W-whatever you're thinking...

30:43.624 --> 30:45.278
You're wrong.

30:54.635 --> 30:56.245
- Laura.

31:00.119 --> 31:02.208
Laura, we need to talk.

31:02.251 --> 31:04.210
- Greg said we didn't have to.

31:05.820 --> 31:08.127
- Well, it's not up to Greg.

31:10.956 --> 31:14.960
Shakespeare, it's--
it's pretty grown-up stuff.

31:15.003 --> 31:17.658
- I am grown up.
- Well, good, because--

31:17.701 --> 31:20.313
because I have
a grown-up question.

31:21.270 --> 31:24.839
You said that you love Greg.

31:24.883 --> 31:27.711
- I meant like
a brother, family.

31:27.755 --> 31:30.105
- Did Greg tell you
to say that?

31:30.149 --> 31:31.933
Because I know that you two

31:31.977 --> 31:34.893
are reading "Romeo and Juliet"
together...

31:34.936 --> 31:36.329
- He helps me with
my English homework.

31:36.372 --> 31:38.331
- But I saw the inscription.

31:39.288 --> 31:41.725
You are Juliet
and he's Romeo.

31:43.075 --> 31:45.642
So you two are in love.

31:45.686 --> 31:47.079
- You think I'm too young
to be in love.

31:47.122 --> 31:49.298
- No, not at all.

31:49.342 --> 31:52.823
Not with someone your own age.

31:54.173 --> 31:56.958
- Juliet was 13.

31:57.002 --> 32:01.093
My mother,
she killed herself.

32:01.136 --> 32:05.314
I'm not like other girls,
playing with baby dolls.

32:05.358 --> 32:07.795
I am a real woman.

32:07.838 --> 32:09.797
- Is that what Greg said?

32:09.840 --> 32:11.712
Because he told us...

32:13.148 --> 32:15.324
That it was
a schoolgirl crush.

32:17.457 --> 32:19.894
- That's a laugh.
That's a lie.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.113
Greg wouldn't say that.

32:21.156 --> 32:24.116
- He did say that.

32:24.159 --> 32:25.900
- Juliet fell in love
with someone

32:25.944 --> 32:28.294
who she wasn't supposed to.

32:28.337 --> 32:30.861
We're star-crossed lovers

32:30.905 --> 32:32.689
even when it hurts,
because that's what people--

32:32.733 --> 32:34.387
- Who love each other do?

32:36.780 --> 32:40.871
Laura, I know...

32:40.915 --> 32:44.963
that it wasn't your father
who had sex with you.

32:46.355 --> 32:48.270
I know that it was Greg.

32:51.882 --> 32:53.319
- I would never betray him.

32:53.362 --> 32:57.192
- Honey, but he betrayed you.

32:58.759 --> 33:00.326
- He wouldn't do that.

33:00.369 --> 33:02.763
- But he did.

33:02.806 --> 33:05.809
He told us that he was in love
with Susan.

33:08.116 --> 33:10.249
- No.

33:10.292 --> 33:11.990
You--you're wrong.

33:12.033 --> 33:13.817
Susan doesn't even have
a ring on her ringer.

33:13.861 --> 33:17.038
- That's not what love is.
- How would you know?

33:17.082 --> 33:18.909
You don't have a ring either.

33:20.781 --> 33:22.174
But I do.

33:22.217 --> 33:23.871
- What?

33:24.915 --> 33:26.743
- See?

33:28.745 --> 33:32.184
Greg proposed.

33:32.227 --> 33:35.056
As soon as I turn 18,
we're getting married.

33:49.723 --> 33:51.290
- No.

33:51.333 --> 33:52.987
No, my father--

33:53.031 --> 33:55.729
he's the one that
was having sex with Laura.

33:55.772 --> 33:58.558
That's why I had to kill him.

33:58.601 --> 34:03.432
- Britney, your sister
lied to you.

34:03.476 --> 34:05.260
She lied to you
about your father.

34:05.304 --> 34:08.002
She lied to you
about her and Greg.

34:08.046 --> 34:10.439
- No, she wouldn't do that.
- Not on her own.

34:10.483 --> 34:14.530
But Greg--Greg manipulated her.

34:14.574 --> 34:18.186
Greg was the one
who was abusing her.

34:18.230 --> 34:20.362
- Britney had no idea of
any relationship

34:20.406 --> 34:22.234
between her sister
and Greg Callahan.

34:22.277 --> 34:23.496
- We believe that,

34:23.539 --> 34:25.019
but we need
to hear it from her.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.152
- There was no relationship
between them.

34:28.544 --> 34:30.590
- So, Britney,
your sister told you

34:30.633 --> 34:33.375
that your father
was abusing her at night,

34:34.550 --> 34:38.815
and she told us that it was
on Thursday afternoons

34:38.859 --> 34:42.123
when you were at band practice.

34:42.167 --> 34:45.126
So when you came home...

34:45.170 --> 34:48.738
was your father there?

34:48.782 --> 34:52.090
Or was Laura
at Greg's apartment?

34:53.134 --> 34:55.049
- Look,
none of this is possible.

34:55.093 --> 34:56.833
Greg has a girlfriend.

34:56.877 --> 35:01.099
- Was Susan at Greg's apartment
on those Thursday afternoons?

35:02.709 --> 35:05.364
I...

35:05.407 --> 35:06.539
I don't know.

35:06.582 --> 35:10.151
- Greg didn't care about Susan.

35:10.195 --> 35:11.761
He was after your sister.

35:11.805 --> 35:14.155
He manipulated her.

35:14.199 --> 35:18.203
He convinced her that
she was in love with him.

35:18.246 --> 35:20.553
He even went so far as...

35:22.424 --> 35:24.774
To propose to her.

35:24.818 --> 35:26.733
- He asked her to marry him?

35:26.776 --> 35:28.387
- Yes.

35:30.606 --> 35:33.566
- It's that stupid ring.

35:33.609 --> 35:35.698
That's why she's been so happy.

35:35.742 --> 35:38.136
- What did she say?
What--what did she tell you?

35:38.179 --> 35:39.833
- That, um,

35:39.876 --> 35:41.574
that me and her and Greg,

35:41.617 --> 35:43.184
we were gonna
all live together,

35:43.228 --> 35:44.838
you know, and everything
was gonna be okay.

35:44.881 --> 35:46.622
And then she'd just been--

35:46.666 --> 35:49.495
been babbling on about, like,
this "Romeo and Juliet" stuff,

35:49.538 --> 35:51.627
which I...

35:55.805 --> 35:57.894
Oh, my God.

36:01.159 --> 36:04.162
What did she do?

36:06.381 --> 36:08.731
What did I do?

36:08.775 --> 36:11.778
- This isn't your fault

36:11.821 --> 36:14.433
or Laura's.

36:14.476 --> 36:18.263
This is one person's fault
and that's Greg,

36:18.306 --> 36:22.876
and we will make sure
that he never hurts you

36:22.919 --> 36:25.792
or your sister again.

36:47.292 --> 36:49.511
- Hey, Britney, how's it going?

36:51.513 --> 36:54.647
So my lawyer said they were
gonna drop the charges,

36:54.690 --> 36:56.649
but I'm still not really
supposed to talk to you

36:56.692 --> 36:58.346
or Laura until everything
gets sorted out.

36:58.390 --> 37:01.219
- But Laura won't stop crying.

37:01.262 --> 37:02.220
I'm worried.

37:02.263 --> 37:03.482
- She's gonna be fine.

37:03.525 --> 37:06.398
- I'm scared
she's gonna kill herself.

37:08.313 --> 37:11.751
Like my mom.
Like Juliet.

37:13.579 --> 37:15.320
- What did Laura tell you?

37:17.626 --> 37:19.367
She--look,

37:19.411 --> 37:21.456
you know how she makes
things up.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.371
- Son of a bitch.
- The undercovers are close by?

37:23.415 --> 37:24.981
- A booth away.

37:25.025 --> 37:27.288
She'll be okay, Liv.

37:27.332 --> 37:29.508
- She showed me the ring.

37:29.551 --> 37:32.902
The one you gave her.

37:32.946 --> 37:35.688
- Okay, yeah,
I got her a ring.

37:35.731 --> 37:37.646
It was just to make her
feel better.

37:37.690 --> 37:39.953
- Did you ask her
to marry you?

37:39.996 --> 37:43.870
- What?
No, of course not.

37:43.913 --> 37:45.872
- So you're calling
Laura a liar.

37:45.915 --> 37:50.442
- She lives
in a fantasy world.

37:50.485 --> 37:53.706
Look, just hang in there,
Britney.

37:53.749 --> 37:55.751
I'm gonna
get guardianship back

37:55.795 --> 37:57.579
and we're all gonna
live together.

37:57.623 --> 37:59.929
You, me, and Laura.

38:01.714 --> 38:03.846
- And the baby?

38:04.804 --> 38:06.893
- What?

38:06.936 --> 38:08.721
- Look,
I think Laura's pregnant.

38:08.764 --> 38:10.244
- We didn't tell her
to say that.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.854
- She's going off script,
winging it.

38:11.898 --> 38:14.292
You want me to stop this?
- I'm worried.

38:14.335 --> 38:15.989
- No.

38:16.032 --> 38:18.644
No, let's--
let's give her a minute.

38:18.687 --> 38:22.343
- Pregnant?
Why would you think that?

38:27.435 --> 38:29.524
Okay.

38:29.568 --> 38:32.397
Okay, let me think.

38:32.440 --> 38:34.442
- Look, I-I think we need
to get Laura to a doctor,

38:34.486 --> 38:35.748
get her tested,
and see if it's my dad's.

38:35.791 --> 38:37.750
- Just hold on.

38:37.793 --> 38:40.448
- Unless, uh,

38:40.492 --> 38:42.407
unless it's your baby.

38:43.451 --> 38:46.585
- What did Laura tell you?

38:46.628 --> 38:49.327
- We're sisters.

38:49.370 --> 38:50.937
We don't have secrets.

38:53.983 --> 38:57.813
- Okay.

39:00.860 --> 39:03.645
- Look, I love her,

39:03.689 --> 39:05.952
and maybe this is
for the best.

39:05.995 --> 39:07.606
- Dude, she's 13.

39:07.649 --> 39:10.043
- She's had to grow up fast.
You and I both know that.

39:10.086 --> 39:13.307
- She told me that my father
was forcing her to have sex,

39:13.351 --> 39:15.570
but you know what?
- Let's move. Now.

39:15.614 --> 39:16.789
- It was you!
- Stop, Britney!

39:16.832 --> 39:19.008
- I killed my father for you!

39:22.360 --> 39:23.622
Help me, I'm bleeding!

39:23.665 --> 39:24.971
- Shut up!
She should've killed you.

39:25.014 --> 39:26.451
You're under arrest.

39:29.889 --> 39:32.805
- Britney,
put the knife down, honey.

39:32.848 --> 39:34.894
There you go.

39:34.937 --> 39:36.939
It's okay.

39:36.983 --> 39:41.422
- It's okay.

39:41.466 --> 39:43.468
I got you, honey,
I got you.

39:54.130 --> 39:55.741
- Greg took a plea.

39:55.784 --> 39:57.482
Twenty-five years for
rape of a minor,

39:57.525 --> 39:59.484
conspiracy
to commit murder.

39:59.527 --> 40:00.963
- And Laura and Britney?

40:01.007 --> 40:02.965
- Family Court Judge
agreed to probation.

40:03.009 --> 40:04.837
Mandatory counseling for both.

40:06.099 --> 40:08.057
- All the counseling
in the world.

40:08.101 --> 40:11.452
- Yeah, you're telling me.

40:11.496 --> 40:14.020
- Oh!
- What is it?

40:14.063 --> 40:15.804
- Rollins had her baby.

40:15.848 --> 40:17.893
Look at that.

40:19.547 --> 40:21.593
- Mm.

40:25.553 --> 40:27.816
- She's early,
but she's healthy.

40:27.860 --> 40:29.731
Thank God.
- You did great, Rollins.

40:29.775 --> 40:30.950
She's--she's so beautiful.

40:30.993 --> 40:32.081
- Thanks.
- What's her name?

40:32.125 --> 40:33.692
- Billie.
- Billie? Nice.

40:33.735 --> 40:35.084
-  Yeah.
- Jesse and Billie.

40:35.128 --> 40:36.825
You like your new sister,
Jesse?

40:36.869 --> 40:37.913
- I love her!

40:40.612 --> 40:42.048
- Hey!

40:42.091 --> 40:43.789
- There you are!

40:43.832 --> 40:45.399
- And what did I miss?

40:45.443 --> 40:48.489
- Look.
-  She's perfect.

40:50.535 --> 40:53.189
- Just us.

40:53.233 --> 40:55.191
Just family.

40:59.544 --> 41:02.024
- Hello, hello.
