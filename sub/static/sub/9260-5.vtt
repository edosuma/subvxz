this kilo of pure heroin in the

It sure as hell isn't Mackey's.

to get Emolia to give you up.

We gotta go. We gotta move you.

00:31.320 --> 00:32.514

You said Vic wouldn't find out.

What did you tell him?

00:40.800 --> 00:43.314
That I saw your guy
take the heroin. That's it.

00:43.880 --> 00:45.757
Six months you could
have warned me.

00:45.960 --> 00:48.918
One of my men, maybe all of us
are going to jail because of you.

I had no idea that Vic knew about
you giving up one of his guys.

01:07.720 --> 01:10.712
That's my fault.
I made a mistake. I'm sorry.

that you and Sebastio are safe.

You know that you may
have to testify against Vic
and his guys in court.

That's part of
the deal you signed.
You know that, right?

01:36.480 --> 01:38.311
No. Not with them there.

01:38.520 --> 01:43.355
Yeah. I'm sorry,
it's part of the conditions.

01:43.560 --> 01:44.879
No, you never said that.
