00:01.487 --> 00:04.970
Stealing Han's dishes, so we don't
have to clean our at home is genius.

00:05.897 --> 00:07.455
And a little sad.

00:08.686 --> 00:11.426
You kidding? This is the greatest
thing that's happened to me

00:11.427 --> 00:13.429
since I got my
period this morning.

00:14.110 --> 00:17.027
Max, Caroline,
you're stealing my dishes?

00:17.028 --> 00:20.497
Damn it, I didn't think
you could see up this high.

00:20.499 --> 00:23.868
And I didn't think
you could sink this low.

00:23.870 --> 00:25.903
Okay, stop, you're already
robbing me blind

00:25.905 --> 00:28.540
with your
"I'm a waitress" scam.

00:28.542 --> 00:31.430
Sorry, but things have gotten
kind of messy at home.

00:31.432 --> 00:35.489
Yesterday, I had to take a shower
to shower off the shower I took.

00:35.491 --> 00:37.774
You two should get
a cleaning lady.

00:37.775 --> 00:40.244
I have a woman I pay
to clean my apartment.

00:40.245 --> 00:42.553
She is expensive,
but she may charge you less

00:42.554 --> 00:45.371
if you don't also
have sex on her.

00:52.471 --> 00:54.402
I'll look into it.

00:54.403 --> 00:57.484
My grandmother cleaned the house
free of charge.

00:57.485 --> 01:00.881
Of course she didn't have
a say in the matter.

01:02.607 --> 01:05.138
Let's just ask Sophie.
She has a cleaning service.

01:05.140 --> 01:06.573
We have to do something.

01:06.575 --> 01:10.284
Yesterday, I saw a roach
walk out of our apartment.

01:10.286 --> 01:11.657
Look.

01:11.659 --> 01:13.136
I'm gonna tell you
what I told that guy

01:13.138 --> 01:16.936
who asked me to use my butt
to smuggle opium.

01:16.938 --> 01:20.245
I'll do it!

We have to leave as soon as
the cleaning lady gets here.

01:40.033 --> 01:41.504
It's housekeeper etiquette.

01:41.505 --> 01:43.810
In my old life, I go to spin
class and lunch with friends,

01:43.811 --> 01:45.726
but you and I
will just go outside

01:45.727 --> 01:49.797

of jail do pull-ups on the light post.

Calvin's out?

02:00.014 --> 02:02.921
Yeah, baby.

02:02.923 --> 02:05.827
I've waited my whole life
to have a servant.

02:06.076 --> 02:08.098
I thought you were gonna be it
for the first few weeks

02:08.098 --> 02:10.679

you can't do anything.

02:12.051 --> 02:13.921
And even though Sophie
gave us a discount,

02:13.922 --> 02:16.460
the maid still has to call me
"Your Highness."

02:16.462 --> 02:19.932
Mostly because I'm pretty
"highness" right now.

02:19.934 --> 02:22.949
Hi, girls.

02:24.197 --> 02:25.764

Sophie from Sophie's Choice

Paulina,
meet the girls.

02:32.138 --> 02:34.140
Mm.

02:34.142 --> 02:38.414
She'd shake hands,
but she only has one arm.

02:38.416 --> 02:40.184
Sophie, she can hear you.

02:40.186 --> 02:42.021
So what?
I know I'm missing arm.

02:42.023 --> 02:44.124
It's not news.

02:44.126 --> 02:45.690
So she lost an arm.

02:45.692 --> 02:47.924
I lost my gold earring
down the garbage disposal

02:47.926 --> 02:50.225
but I was too afraid
to reach into it

02:50.227 --> 02:53.998
because, well, yeah.

03:00.204 --> 03:01.636
Don't worry.

03:01.638 --> 03:04.237
I have one arm but I clean

03:04.239 --> 03:07.945
I put on more makeup,
then I start.

03:07.947 --> 03:10.577
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
when I ordered a cleaning lady

03:10.578 --> 03:12.876
I had to specify
I wanted one with two arms.

03:12.878 --> 03:15.710
You can't afford two arms.

03:15.712 --> 03:18.063
You said you wanted
a good price.

03:18.064 --> 03:20.653
Half the arms,
half the price.

03:20.654 --> 03:23.147
Is that how she lost
the arm, Sophie?

03:23.149 --> 03:25.781
You cut it off
so we could get a discount?

03:25.783 --> 03:30.590
Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah, I sawed off
her arm so I could save you 10 bucks.

03:32.122 --> 03:33.791
I start in bedroom.

03:33.793 --> 03:35.761
Wait, before you do,
one question.

03:35.763 --> 03:38.296
How'd you lose it?
James Franco situation?

03:38.298 --> 03:41.498
You had to cut it off
to get loose?

03:41.500 --> 03:43.635

for my good jewelry in there

04:02.297 --> 04:05.664

04:05.666 --> 04:10.269
Oh, I'm jealous I don't have arm
to wear cheap jewelry.

04:15.373 --> 04:18.476
Max, I feel bad for her. See?
This is why you leave.

04:18.478 --> 04:21.784
In case they show up with too
much makeup and not enough arms.

04:21.786 --> 04:25.286
Relax, she's tough.
Reminds me of a young me.

04:25.288 --> 04:27.355
Which means I better go
hide my pills from her.

04:27.357 --> 04:29.426
Max, she scares me.

[Grunts] Everything okay?
You need any help?

04:38.438 --> 04:42.074
I didn't get this far in this
business by taking help.

04:44.511 --> 04:47.577
Help me! Can't you see
I got one arm?

04:47.579 --> 04:49.746
Not gonna be a problem.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.814
I would occasionally
help my maid...

04:51.816 --> 04:54.216
- You're not interested.
- Lift!

04:54.218 --> 04:56.552

Ah, porno.

05:08.099 --> 05:12.300
Your mind is as dirty
as your apartment!

05:12.302 --> 05:15.005
Yes, it's porn. So what?
What's the big deal?

05:15.007 --> 05:19.306
It's just the body in its natural form,
spread-eagle on a motorcycle.

05:19.308 --> 05:21.697
Why is so much of it
from the '80s?

05:21.698 --> 05:23.909

05:33.116 --> 05:36.850
Hey, is this a brochure
for pastry school?

05:36.852 --> 05:39.822
Why are you hiding
a pastry school brochure?

05:39.824 --> 05:44.191
Your face is
a pastry school brochure!

05:44.193 --> 05:47.359
Max, it's great you're
interested in pastry school.

05:47.361 --> 05:49.894
- I don't know why you're embarrassed.
- Your face is embarrassed!

05:49.896 --> 05:53.098
Come on, I really think that
this is something we should talk about.

05:53.100 --> 05:56.667
Your face is something
we should talk about!

05:56.669 --> 05:59.336
You made the scary one mad.

05:59.338 --> 06:00.704
That was dumb move.

06:00.706 --> 06:03.807
Your face was a dumb move!

06:08.045 --> 06:09.412
Max?

06:09.414 --> 06:12.580
Max, you never came home after you stormed
out, so I brought you your uniform.

06:12.582 --> 06:15.479
Max?

06:15.481 --> 06:17.516
I live here now.

06:17.518 --> 06:19.987

the broom and the mop,

06:19.989 --> 06:23.093
don't sneak around

06:24.628 --> 06:27.093
Whiskey, toothbrush,
toothpaste.

06:27.095 --> 06:30.293
Well, maybe your
new <i>broommate</i>

06:30.295 --> 06:32.496
will hold back your hair
when you drink too much.

06:32.498 --> 06:36.034
Which, from the looks of it,
will be in about an hour.

06:36.036 --> 06:37.903
Max, we really need
to talk about this brochure.

06:37.905 --> 06:40.668
Look, just because I have
a pastry school brochure

06:40.670 --> 06:43.137
doesn't mean I'm actually
gonna go to pastry school.

06:43.139 --> 06:44.940
Just like having
those porn magazines

06:44.942 --> 06:47.243
doesn't mean I'm actually
gonna ride around on a tiger

06:47.245 --> 06:51.812
performing unspeakable acts
with sailors, probably.

06:51.814 --> 06:54.279
Pastry school
is the same as porn.

06:54.281 --> 06:55.380
It's just a dumb fantasy.

06:55.382 --> 06:57.483
Pastry school is not
like porn.

06:57.485 --> 07:00.954
There is nothing in this brochure
about a girl-on-girl croissant.

07:02.624 --> 07:04.921
That's good toothpaste.

07:04.923 --> 07:08.591
Please stop brushing your teeth.
We have a shift to do later.

07:08.593 --> 07:10.560
Okay, the Manhattan
school of pastry...

07:10.562 --> 07:12.864
Your face is the Manhattan
school of pastry.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.433
You know it isn't.

07:14.435 --> 07:17.267
Max, you could
go here for real.

07:17.269 --> 07:20.832
Tuition is only $3,000 a year.
A lot, but doable.

07:20.834 --> 07:22.603
"A lot but doable?"

07:22.605 --> 07:26.543
Are we talking about pastry
school or fat guy at last call?

07:35.811 --> 07:38.510
Here we are, Max.
Your dream starts now.

07:38.511 --> 07:41.659
What, the one where
I'm a black mermaid?

07:41.661 --> 07:45.592
Would you relax? We're just gonna
look around and get an application.

07:45.631 --> 07:49.077
See all that gorgeous equipment
you get to use if you went here?

07:49.103 --> 07:51.918
Finally you'd have a mixing bowl
that's not a hollowed-out watermelon.

07:51.919 --> 07:53.122
[Knocks]

07:53.123 --> 07:55.620

against my will.

07:55.621 --> 07:57.782
[Laughs] She's kidding.

07:57.783 --> 08:01.419
If you keep this up, young lady,
you are not getting ice cream after.

08:01.421 --> 08:03.554
Fine!

08:03.556 --> 08:06.924
- Come on, here's the office.
- Whatever. Are we almost done here?

08:06.926 --> 08:09.293
I got a court date later.

08:09.295 --> 08:11.042

in the right place.

08:18.214 --> 08:20.946
Are any of us, really?

08:20.948 --> 08:24.431
We'd like an application.
Could you help us?

08:24.435 --> 08:27.132
Oh, God, I hope so.

08:27.134 --> 08:31.669
I wasn't expecting something this
high-pressure my first day back.

observation at the nuthouse.

08:35.905 --> 08:38.240
Okay, application.

08:38.241 --> 08:42.248
It's for Max, here. She was
very impressed by your brochure.

08:42.250 --> 08:45.255
Oh, pastry school.
Exciting, right?

08:45.257 --> 08:48.960
I was a chef here once.
And then I wasn't.

08:53.466 --> 08:56.301
Oh, look.
Found the application.

08:56.303 --> 08:59.404
Wow. Really didn't think I was
gonna be able to handle that.

09:01.373 --> 09:04.340
Oh. <i>Bonjour.</i> Good morning.

Chef Nicolas, these girls
are here for an application.

09:10.817 --> 09:14.585
Don't worry, I handled it.
Almost didn't, then I did.

09:14.587 --> 09:16.453
Nice work, Bebe.

09:16.455 --> 09:20.193
Oh, do I detect
a French accent? <i>Oui?</i>

09:20.195 --> 09:22.062
Oh, my God,
I can't watch.

09:22.064 --> 09:25.365
French, indeed.
I'm chef Nicolas Saintcroix,

09:32.982 --> 09:35.183

This is Max.
The application's for her.

09:36.622 --> 09:39.124

You eat snails?

forgot the second page.

Oh, boy, forgot the second page.
That's not good.

09:44.299 --> 09:47.134
I thought I handled it.
Didn't handle it.

09:47.136 --> 09:48.937
It's okay, Bebe.
Breathe in.

09:48.939 --> 09:50.105
[Inhales]

09:50.107 --> 09:52.474
Breathe out. [Exhales]

09:52.476 --> 09:55.877
That's good stuff.

09:55.879 --> 09:57.912
She was quite brilliant.

09:57.914 --> 10:00.312
Then she wasn't.

10:00.314 --> 10:04.178
Here. Fill that out.
And the next step is the pastry exam.

10:04.180 --> 10:06.113
Applicants will have to
make a classic tart,

10:06.115 --> 10:07.980
bring them in tomorrow
for me to taste,

10:07.982 --> 10:10.249
and we will go from there.
Sound good?

10:10.251 --> 10:13.119
Whatever.
Maybe I'll think about it.

10:13.121 --> 10:17.389
Okay, well, maybe you will.
Nice meeting you both.

10:19.895 --> 10:22.558
Hope to see you tomorrow, chef.

10:24.605 --> 10:27.704
He called me chef!

10:27.706 --> 10:30.139
- Yay! Let's go get ice cream!
- No!

10:30.141 --> 10:33.041
You should get started on that tart.
It's due tomorrow.

10:33.043 --> 10:36.411
I got plenty of time. Besides,
pressure ups my game.

10:36.413 --> 10:38.279
I perform my best
when there's a gun to my head.

10:38.281 --> 10:39.948
Ask any of my ex-boyfriends.

10:39.950 --> 10:42.753
This is so not
how I prepare for tests.

10:42.755 --> 10:46.305
I studied three weeks
for a pap smear.

10:47.295 --> 10:50.099
Don't worry, I got this.

10:50.101 --> 10:54.375
A tart's just like a cookie
with some pudding on it, right?

10:59.879 --> 11:03.282
[Coughs]

11:03.284 --> 11:06.385
Max, what is
going on in here?

11:06.387 --> 11:10.122
Turns out a tart's more than a
cookie with some pudding on it!

11:10.124 --> 11:14.460
You've been in here six hours.
You said you had this.

11:14.462 --> 11:18.198
I thought I had this! Turns out I don't!
I haven't even finished a shell.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.569
I didn't know there was a shell.
Did you know there was a shell?

11:20.571 --> 11:22.872
Everybody knows
there's a shell!

11:22.874 --> 11:25.376
What the shell
is wrong with you?

11:25.378 --> 11:29.443
I'm a tart
who can't make a tart!

11:29.445 --> 11:31.775
You could've made
nine shells by now.

11:31.777 --> 11:34.013
I did.
They're all in here. Look.

11:34.015 --> 11:37.386
It's like <i>Shell-mageddon!</i>

11:37.388 --> 11:39.155
Oh, screw it. This one's
gonna be there in a minute.

11:39.157 --> 11:40.657
Let's just get it over with.

11:40.659 --> 11:44.450
No, you can do this. Here. Here.
This still looks ready to go.

11:44.451 --> 11:47.508
Look at me. Look at me.
I'm a waste of two arms.

11:51.368 --> 11:52.834
I can't make a tart!

11:52.836 --> 11:55.677
How's the tart coming?

11:56.738 --> 11:59.005
Han, you're not safe.
Leave.

11:59.007 --> 12:02.711
You haven't even finished the shell?
That's the easiest part!

12:02.713 --> 12:06.095
Han, this is your face.

12:07.186 --> 12:09.054
Well, I should get going.

12:09.056 --> 12:13.222
I didn't know she could
take <i>bitch</i> to the next level.

12:17.030 --> 12:18.866
I am so screwed!

12:18.868 --> 12:21.940
I finally found a situation
my boobs can't get me out of!

12:21.942 --> 12:26.411
Hey, Max. Now, I have all
the faith in the world in you.

12:26.413 --> 12:30.117
But here's a tart from <i>Stop 'n Shop</i>
in case you wanted to hand this one in.

12:30.119 --> 12:32.856
No, Earl.
Max is not a cheater.

12:32.858 --> 12:34.726
Both: Since when?

12:34.728 --> 12:37.796
She is going to make
her own tart.

12:37.798 --> 12:40.933
You, out.

12:40.935 --> 12:44.935
I am never gonna make this shell.
I can't even get it in the pan right.

12:44.937 --> 12:46.470
Max, that looks right.

12:46.472 --> 12:49.810
Oh, my God! I got it in the pan right!
I can do this!

12:49.812 --> 12:52.048
You did it! I knew it!
I helped you. We're besties.

12:52.050 --> 12:54.851
You're not safe. Leave.

13:04.667 --> 13:09.038
I'm telling you, Max, I've tasted
a lot of tarts, and yours is delicious.

13:09.040 --> 13:11.641
You are not the first man
to tell me that.

13:11.643 --> 13:14.173
The first man
to tell me that is in jail.

13:15.843 --> 13:19.044
Here he comes. Look at him.
Here he comes.

13:19.046 --> 13:21.246
Afternoon, ladies.

13:21.248 --> 13:23.815
<i>Bien</i> fondue,
Eiffel Tower.

13:23.817 --> 13:25.783
Okay.

13:25.785 --> 13:28.886
Thank you for coming.
Shall we begin the tasting?

13:28.888 --> 13:30.554
This is exciting, huh?

13:31.579 --> 13:33.643
Uh...

13:34.393 --> 13:36.157
Keep it in your pants.

13:36.159 --> 13:38.123
And now for the tart.

13:38.125 --> 13:39.390
It's Max's first ever.

13:39.392 --> 13:40.925
I ate a slice earlier
and it was like

13:40.927 --> 13:44.630
[French accent]
Having a little piece of heaven.

13:44.632 --> 13:47.168
Don't do anything
you're doing.

13:47.170 --> 13:50.472
It's flaky, creamy...

13:50.474 --> 13:53.925
For a first attempt,
I am very impressed.

13:53.926 --> 13:55.913
Don't be. I made a tart.

13:55.914 --> 13:57.514
It's not like I cured herpes

13:57.516 --> 14:01.317
or invented a reverse microwave
to instantly chill sodas.

14:01.319 --> 14:03.188
Okay, Max.

14:03.190 --> 14:07.493
I will talk it over with my faculty
and we will let you know.

14:07.495 --> 14:11.292
I'll let <i>you</i> know.

14:11.294 --> 14:13.892
Nailed that.

14:17.465 --> 14:19.265
<i>(Han) Max!</i>

14:19.267 --> 14:21.866
Stop stealing my things!
You got a cleaning lady!

14:21.868 --> 14:24.369
Relax.
I am returning what I took.

14:24.371 --> 14:26.205
Here's your plates.

14:26.207 --> 14:30.479
Oh, and here's your ATM card.
I lifted it from your wallet.

14:30.481 --> 14:33.219
Oh, and here's your wallet.

14:33.221 --> 14:35.388
There was $40 in here.

14:35.390 --> 14:37.290
There sure was.

14:37.292 --> 14:42.065
At least give me back
my gift card from Sephora.

14:43.400 --> 14:45.532
Caroline, Han wants
his Sephora gift card back.

14:45.534 --> 14:49.351
Oh, that's not happening.
It's already on my face.

14:49.352 --> 14:53.342
- Max, look, it's from the pastry school.
- Whoo-hoo! My acceptance letter!

14:53.344 --> 14:57.642
Lot of people talking about
my chili in that bathroom.

14:57.644 --> 15:01.113
Oleg, come here.
Han, Earl, stay.

15:01.115 --> 15:03.317
You guys are about
to owe me big.

15:03.319 --> 15:06.255
I am gonna let you witness
something extremely rare.

15:06.257 --> 15:11.020
More rare than a sighting of
Bigfoot or a UFO or Han's penis.

15:11.022 --> 15:14.189
You held me here
so I could hear that?

15:14.191 --> 15:16.860
Behold, the rarest
sight of them all.

15:16.862 --> 15:19.698
You are about to see something
good actually happen to me.

15:19.700 --> 15:21.531
Listen to this.

15:21.533 --> 15:23.898
"Dear Ms. Black,
after careful consideration

15:23.900 --> 15:27.559
"of our large pool of applicants,
we regret to inform you..."

15:28.027 --> 15:30.731
Oh, I guess I didn't get in.

15:35.447 --> 15:37.381
Looking back, we probably
should have insisted

15:37.383 --> 15:40.754
she read that to herself,
first.

15:40.756 --> 15:43.559
I know why she didn't get in.
Her name.

15:43.561 --> 15:47.863
They saw the word "Black"
and stopped reading.

15:47.865 --> 15:50.534
That's why I didn't
get into law school.

15:50.536 --> 15:53.091
I also didn't apply.

15:54.043 --> 15:56.479
This is terrible.
I'm gonna go see if she's okay.

15:56.481 --> 15:59.281
Who does that French frog
think he is?

15:59.283 --> 16:01.883
He thinks he can have the time
of his life tasting my tart

16:01.885 --> 16:03.885
and then never see me again?

16:03.887 --> 16:06.022
He won't let me
into his school?

16:06.024 --> 16:07.992
Well, I won't take no
for an answer.

16:07.994 --> 16:09.662
I am going down there right now

16:09.664 --> 16:11.164
and giving him
a piece of my mind.

16:11.166 --> 16:12.882
I am storming out.

16:14.902 --> 16:16.401
And I am storming back in.

16:16.403 --> 16:18.836
It is dark outside.
That school's not open.

16:24.044 --> 16:26.911
Hey, you. Tart tease,
we need a word.

16:26.913 --> 16:28.411
Oh, boy.

16:28.413 --> 16:30.630
What? You love
my pastries

16:30.631 --> 16:33.480
and then regret to inform me I'm
not good enough for your school?

16:33.482 --> 16:36.651
Well, I regret to inform you
that I am good enough

16:36.653 --> 16:38.321
and I want to know why
you won't let me in here.

16:38.323 --> 16:42.294
Okay, uh, your voice
is an anxiety trigger for me.

16:42.296 --> 16:47.598
I'm going to have to remove myself from
the situation and go sit in the hallway.

16:48.703 --> 16:51.639
Can you come with me? You have
a very calming presence.

16:51.641 --> 16:55.045
Thank you. So few people
think that about me.

16:55.047 --> 16:56.680
But I should stay with Max.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.582
No, I got this handled.
You can have her.

16:58.584 --> 17:00.584
This is the last time
you give me to someone.

17:02.557 --> 17:07.333
Max, your tart was excellent.
The problem was your attitude.

17:07.335 --> 17:11.171
You showed no passion
of wanting to be in this school.

17:11.173 --> 17:15.510
And that is why you didn't get in.
It seemed like you didn't want it.

17:15.512 --> 17:18.348
No, no, no,
that's just my attitude.

17:18.349 --> 17:21.750
I act like I don't want anything
because I never got anything I wanted.

17:21.752 --> 17:25.319
But I do want to go to this school
more than I've ever wanted anything.

17:25.320 --> 17:27.166
It's my fantasy and my dream,

17:27.167 --> 17:31.170
and please stop making me use
these horrible, horrible words!

17:31.172 --> 17:33.538
Just let me in, okay?

17:34.414 --> 17:35.734
Okay.

17:41.749 --> 17:44.052
Wait, for real?

17:44.054 --> 17:47.855
Yes. I needed to see if your passion
was as good as your pastry

17:47.857 --> 17:50.554
and you just showed me it was.

17:50.556 --> 17:53.172
I'm thrilled to have you
on board, chef.

17:53.173 --> 17:55.541
Thanks, chef.

17:56.997 --> 17:59.633
Bebe is having a panic attack
and needs to hold her lemon.

17:59.635 --> 18:01.666
Has anyone seen her lemon?

18:01.668 --> 18:04.800
Caroline, he let me in.
I'm going to pastry school.

18:04.802 --> 18:06.736
Everybody has to
call me "chef" now!

18:06.738 --> 18:08.539
You did it, chef!

18:08.541 --> 18:10.510
You're going to the pastry
school from the brochure!

18:10.512 --> 18:13.341
Aren't you glad
I looked at your porn?

18:15.185 --> 18:19.244
We're roommates. Both single.
<i>Quelle surprise.</i>

18:20.883 --> 18:24.813
So Max, once you fill out these,
you will be officially enrolled.

18:25.285 --> 18:27.493
And of course we will need
your tuition check.

18:27.495 --> 18:29.693
Yup. $3,000.
It's a lot for us.

18:29.695 --> 18:32.329
But if we make some cutbacks,
1/2-ply toilet paper.

18:32.331 --> 18:36.171
Who am I kidding?
No toilet paper, diner napkins.

18:36.173 --> 18:39.473
No, tuition is 24,000.

18:39.475 --> 18:42.674
But the brochure
said $3,000 a year.

18:42.676 --> 18:45.345
You misread it.
It's $3,000 a unit.

18:45.347 --> 18:48.681
There is eight units per year.
24,000.

18:48.683 --> 18:53.717
It costs $24,000?
We can't pay that.

18:53.719 --> 18:56.289
Oh, my God, now I'm never
gonna be able to come here

18:56.291 --> 18:57.926
and I just admitted
I wanted to!

18:57.928 --> 19:00.595
I take back everything I ever
said about wanting anything.

19:00.597 --> 19:03.747
- Max, you can't just storm out.
- Your face can't just storm out!

19:06.164 --> 19:09.501
Look, I will do anything for
that girl to go to this school.

19:09.503 --> 19:11.839
In exchange for tuition,
I could work in the office.

19:11.841 --> 19:13.906
Bebe clearly needs someone
to help take the pressure off

19:13.908 --> 19:15.506
and who better than
a mentally stable

19:15.508 --> 19:17.307
Wharton graduate
like myself?

19:17.309 --> 19:20.503
But I'll do anything.
I'll even wash your floors, okay?

19:20.582 --> 19:22.332
Although I'm sure there's
something better than that.

19:22.333 --> 19:25.284
But if you need me to wash the floors,
I will wash the floors.

19:25.286 --> 19:27.385
Really would prefer
to do anything else,

19:27.387 --> 19:31.006
but I'll do it, 'cause I'll do anything
to get her into this school.

19:31.007 --> 19:32.590
Please no floors.

19:33.766 --> 19:37.782
Okay, I will talk it over with my
staff and I will let you know.

19:38.068 --> 19:39.166
Oh, no, no.

19:39.168 --> 19:41.913
I've seen what happens when you give
people the "I'll let you know."

19:41.914 --> 19:44.401
I'm not going anywhere until
you let me know to my face.

19:44.402 --> 19:47.639
With your face.
Your beautiful, beautiful face.

19:57.142 --> 19:59.076
Max, we're not poor enough?

19:59.078 --> 20:03.148
You're starting a hobo
trash fire in our apartment?

20:03.150 --> 20:06.234
Yup. I'm burning my porn
and pastry school brochure.

20:06.269 --> 20:08.677
You know, all my fantasies.

20:08.679 --> 20:13.058
If I learned anything in life it's that
nothing's more flammable than my dreams.

20:13.884 --> 20:17.920
- Are those my slipper socks in there?
- Yeah, those needed to die too.

20:17.922 --> 20:22.497
Well, while you were in our living
room hosting a burning man festival,

20:23.460 --> 20:27.730
I was at the pastry school getting
us a work-study arrangement.

20:27.732 --> 20:29.766
And...

20:30.947 --> 20:33.871
- You're going to pastry school.
- No way!

20:33.873 --> 20:36.273
Here you go.
Your school uniform.

20:36.275 --> 20:38.275
This is where my name's
gonna go!

20:38.277 --> 20:42.148
My chef name,
Conchita Bonfire.

20:42.150 --> 20:44.285
Thank you for this.

20:44.287 --> 20:45.752
And for everything.

20:45.754 --> 20:47.420
You don't have to thank me.

20:47.422 --> 20:50.377
'Cause with your new skills
I'm gonna use you like Kim uses Kanye.

20:51.994 --> 20:55.562
Or Kanye uses Kim. I'm not sure
which of them is winning.

20:55.564 --> 20:58.531
What kind of work-study
arrangement did you make for me?

20:58.533 --> 21:00.731
It's more of a work-study
arrangement for us.

21:00.733 --> 21:03.065
I'll be working in the office
helping out Bebe,

21:03.067 --> 21:04.465
so I'm working,
you're studying.

21:04.467 --> 21:08.404
You're working
at my school? Mom!

21:10.773 --> 21:13.773
