WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:14.223
We all want to please our fathers,
and they, in turn,

00:14.306 --> 00:17.518
want to love us with all their hearts.

00:17.976 --> 00:20.896
<i>Today was the day
of Miss Magic Jesus,</i>

00:20.979 --> 00:24.274
<i>and I couldn't help but wonder if there
was something to this spiritual stuff.</i>

00:24.358 --> 00:25.984
<i>I had made progress with Brick,</i>

00:26.068 --> 00:27.819
<i>Patty had stayed the course,</i>

00:27.903 --> 00:30.697
<i>and I was starting to think
if I had enough faith,</i>

00:30.781 --> 00:33.367
<i>maybe Patty could actually win the crown.</i>

00:34.826 --> 00:38.455
Noah's humble,
but fierce protection of his family

00:38.539 --> 00:41.542
under such difficult circumstances...

00:42.042 --> 00:45.420
<i>And to top it all off,
Coralee was finally reaching out.</i>

00:49.466 --> 00:51.093
<i>Maybe Pastor Mike was right.</i>

00:51.176 --> 00:53.720
<i>With God, all things were possible.</i>

00:53.804 --> 00:55.430
<i>Nothing could go wrong.</i>

00:56.807 --> 01:00.811
Lessons on fatherhood
are everywhere in Scripture,

01:00.894 --> 01:03.939
and we just need to open
the good book to find them.

01:04.940 --> 01:09.361
And tonight, we will choose the girl
who best answers that question

01:09.444 --> 01:12.739
to become Miss Magic Jesus.

01:13.156 --> 01:16.577
But first, let us praise him with song.

01:16.660 --> 01:19.663
"O God, Forsake Me Not."

01:21.000 --> 01:27.074

01:33.552 --> 01:34.428
<i>Oh, God!</i>

01:34.970 --> 01:35.846
<i>Oh, God!</i>

01:35.929 --> 01:38.640
I don't need to see anymore. God!

01:39.975 --> 01:43.770
- Did you take that video yourself?
- God, no. I'm no pervert.

01:44.187 --> 01:46.523
But if you don't want me
to show it to Pastor Mike,

01:46.607 --> 01:50.152
I am gonna need Patty
to drop out of Miss Magic Jesus.

01:50.235 --> 01:52.988
So, not a pervert, just a blackmailer.

01:53.363 --> 01:56.742
If I hadn't intercepted it,
this video could have gone viral.

01:56.825 --> 02:00.078
Patty's life would be ruined,
and your coaching career would be over.

02:00.162 --> 02:02.664
So... think of me as your hero.

02:02.748 --> 02:05.334
Save it, Bob.
You are not doing this for me.

02:05.417 --> 02:07.085
No, I'm doing it for Magnolia.

02:07.502 --> 02:11.465
Patty stole two boyfriends from her,
made her feel like a loser.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.134
Nobody messes with my daughter.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.482
I've never lost anything
in my life...

02:28.565 --> 02:31.902
and I lost two boyfriends
to Patty Bladell.

02:32.444 --> 02:34.112
What does she have that I don't?

02:34.571 --> 02:35.864
32DDs.

02:37.199 --> 02:40.160
But I bet she has
stretch marks all over 'em.

02:40.786 --> 02:44.247
Don't worry, our daddy's making sure
she'll never do another pageant again.

02:44.331 --> 02:46.375
He's not "our daddy."

02:46.458 --> 02:51.546
I told you to keep her away from liquor.
Cough syrup has alcohol.

02:51.630 --> 02:54.424
It does? But it tastes like candy!

02:55.967 --> 02:58.387
Did my plan to blackmail
Bob Armstrong work?

02:58.470 --> 03:00.472
I talked to him.
He has an hour to tell me.

03:00.555 --> 03:04.643
But it doesn't matter if Magnolia
can't even stand up to compete.

03:04.726 --> 03:07.062
Oh, she's fine. Look.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.189
Just slip these on here,

03:09.272 --> 03:12.067
prop her up like this, and...
Oh, okay. See.

03:12.317 --> 03:13.276
Hi!

03:13.568 --> 03:14.736
Oh, thank you.

03:14.820 --> 03:18.699
Oh, I want world peace
and, um, kitties for everybody.

03:19.533 --> 03:23.912
You never should have shot that sex tape.
It completely sent Magnolia over the edge.

03:24.287 --> 03:28.208
Daddy, I was thinking, if Magnolia's
not keeping up with the Barnard image,

03:28.291 --> 03:29.292
I can.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.587
With you behind me, I could go all the way
to Miss American Lady.

03:32.671 --> 03:33.922
Think of the headline.

03:34.214 --> 03:37.718
Poor abandoned orphan gets adopted
and coached to a beauty queen crown

03:37.801 --> 03:40.095
by the DA who threw her mama in prison.

03:40.178 --> 03:41.847
Best pageant story ever!

03:41.930 --> 03:43.181
I'm not your daddy,

03:44.015 --> 03:45.350
you're not an orphan,

03:45.600 --> 03:48.854
I didn't adopt you,
and this isn't about image.

03:49.271 --> 03:50.814
Magnolia's in trouble.

03:51.690 --> 03:55.026
She's having a crisis of confidence,
and she needs a win.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.741
But first, she needs a shower.

04:01.658 --> 04:02.659
A sex tape?

04:03.118 --> 04:05.912
On the day of the pageant?
Are you kidding me?

04:05.996 --> 04:09.166
Is it possible for you
to have a single day

04:09.249 --> 04:12.002
without insane "let's blow up
everybody's life" drama?

04:12.085 --> 04:15.130
<i>Now that I had Christian,
I didn't want Bob to love me in that way,</i>

04:15.213 --> 04:17.841
<i>but I didn't want to lose his love
as a father figure.</i>

04:17.923 --> 04:20.427
<i>He was the first man
who said he would stand by me.</i>

04:20.510 --> 04:21.970
I'm sorry. I didn't...

04:22.053 --> 04:24.890
Yeah, I am very, very disappointed in ya.

04:25.891 --> 04:26.767
How did we look?

04:27.225 --> 04:28.310
Get off my car.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.020
Sorry, just asking.

04:31.146 --> 04:34.858
Oh, my God, Bob. You saw me...

04:34.941 --> 04:36.151
Oh, I don't want to discuss it.

04:36.234 --> 04:38.278
I just have to figure out
what I'm gonna do.

04:38.361 --> 04:41.156
I mean, I can't let Barnard
show your father that tape.

04:41.239 --> 04:44.075
Wait, if he shows him, I'm screwed.
I'm already on thin ice.

04:44.159 --> 04:46.077
I mean, if my mom's willing
to send me to jail...

04:46.161 --> 04:47.078
I can't believe this.

04:47.162 --> 04:52.167
I'm the only virgin in history whose life
is about to get ruined by a sex tape.

04:52.834 --> 04:53.919
Really?

04:54.878 --> 04:57.339
Wait, how can you be a virgin
if you two...?

04:57.422 --> 04:58.256
Oh...

05:00.091 --> 05:01.092
Uh...

05:01.927 --> 05:06.139
So there was no P in the V.
He just kind of made out with my...

05:06.223 --> 05:09.226
Stop. I saw enough
to know what was going on.

05:09.935 --> 05:14.981
Wait, if you didn't actually have sex,
maybe it isn't a sex tape.

05:15.065 --> 05:16.149
Wait, what do you mean?

05:16.233 --> 05:17.984
We'll hit Pastor Mike
with a legal precedent.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.612
Or should I say "president"?

05:21.238 --> 05:22.864
Clinton, that is.

05:23.532 --> 05:28.078
He did not have sex with this woman.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.664
It's all sex in the eyes of the Lord.

05:30.747 --> 05:34.709
- But technically...
- Sex is sex, Bob. That's my ruling.

05:35.460 --> 05:36.920
Please don't kick me out.

05:37.003 --> 05:39.548
I didn't say you were kicked out.

05:39.714 --> 05:43.385
All premarital sex is a sin,
no matter how you slice it.

05:43.468 --> 05:49.474
But kids your age,
they're like geysers full of hormones.

05:49.641 --> 05:52.435
The important thing is, Patty,
you've confessed your sins

05:52.519 --> 05:54.813
and you've taken responsibility
for your actions,

05:54.896 --> 05:59.025
and that shows me that your baptism
has had a real impact on you.

05:59.985 --> 06:01.695
And it's never gonna happen again, right?

06:06.032 --> 06:07.784
- Patty?
- No.

06:08.326 --> 06:12.956
Then I would say you embody exactly
what Miss Magic Jesus is all about.

06:15.917 --> 06:17.335
You can stay in the pageant.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.130
<i>It was a miracle.</i>

06:20.547 --> 06:23.008
<i>Maybe the heavenly father was on our side.</i>

06:24.384 --> 06:26.428
<i>But the devil wasn't through with us yet.</i>

06:26.511 --> 06:28.638
Stella Rose, what are you...?

06:28.722 --> 06:31.182
We had a judge drop out
at the last minute,

06:31.266 --> 06:34.269
and Stella Rose
graciously agreed to fill in.

06:34.561 --> 06:35.896
Hello, Bob.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.689
Is Roxy gonna be in the pageant?

06:37.772 --> 06:38.899
Oh, no.

06:38.982 --> 06:42.986
I already qualified for regionals
when I won Miss Bareback Buckaroo.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.196
She's just here
to check out the competition.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.949
I've never seen
Magnolia Barnard in action.

06:48.033 --> 06:51.494
Stella Rose suggested adding
a new segment to the competition,

06:51.578 --> 06:52.913
Bible Trivia Quiz.

06:52.996 --> 06:57.167
Now, I think this is a great way
to set us apart from the secular pageants.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.169
But we don't have time to study for...

06:59.252 --> 07:02.172
Besides, any girl who's deserving
of the crown of thorns

07:02.255 --> 07:03.381
already knows her Bible.

07:04.049 --> 07:07.218
Pastor Mike,
Stella Rose has a conflict of interest.

07:07.761 --> 07:11.097
Years ago, she was my pageant mentor.

07:11.181 --> 07:12.349
It did not end well.

07:12.432 --> 07:16.645
She may give Patty a low score
to try and settle an old one with me.

07:16.728 --> 07:19.272
Oh, come on, Bob, that's ancient history.

07:19.356 --> 07:21.608
Maybe you and I should go to lunch

07:21.691 --> 07:24.819
and see if we can
put our differences behind us.

07:25.070 --> 07:26.071
What are you doing?

07:26.154 --> 07:28.239
Stella Rose obviously
just came here to screw us.

07:28.323 --> 07:29.908
She wants to screw me.

07:30.575 --> 07:33.870
No. This is between me and Stella Rose.

07:33.954 --> 07:37.457
I am gonna try and convince her
to back off and leave you out of it.

07:37.540 --> 07:38.667
Hold on.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.003
Look, what about the Bible quiz?

07:42.087 --> 07:44.422
She obviously came up with that
to stack the deck against me.

07:44.506 --> 07:46.758
I don't know dick about the Bible.

07:46.841 --> 07:51.429
Maybe start by not saying "dick"
and "Bible" in the same sentence.

07:51.513 --> 07:53.556
Look, you are a straight-A student, Patty.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.725
You know how to do this.

07:55.809 --> 08:00.230
Go home, lock yourself in a room,
and start cramming for Christ.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.488
<i>The only way
to get Stella Rose to back off</i>

08:08.571 --> 08:10.740
<i>was to make her believe she'd already won.</i>

08:10.824 --> 08:13.076
<i>Sure, there was still hope
for me and Coralee,</i>

08:13.159 --> 08:15.120
<i>but Stella Rose didn't need to know that.</i>

08:15.203 --> 08:19.666
All I am saying is leave Patty out of it.
You already got what you wanted.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.460
You broke my heart, Coralee left me.

08:22.544 --> 08:26.631
The only way to really break your heart
is to get you out of the pageants.

08:27.090 --> 08:29.926
Which is why
I'm going to obliterate Patty.

08:30.010 --> 08:33.722
Eating your feelings, Bob?
Aw... Just like fresh manure.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.184
Ahem. Bob Barnard.

08:39.269 --> 08:40.687
The Bob Barnard?

08:40.770 --> 08:44.983
This is Stella Rose Buckley,
my... pageant mentor.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.443
Oh, you've mentioned her before.

08:48.319 --> 08:51.031
I'm a last-minute judge for the MMJ.

08:51.114 --> 08:53.908
Oh, lucky us. You know,
my daughter's in the pageant.

08:53.992 --> 08:56.494
Magnolia Barnard. She's the one to beat.

08:56.578 --> 08:57.704
Not the only one.

08:57.787 --> 09:01.791
Stella Rose brought
her star coaching client, Roxy.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.419
They are here to scope out
the competition.

09:04.502 --> 09:06.755
I need to get some ketchup for my tots.

09:10.675 --> 09:13.178
What do you mean, "not the only one"?

09:13.261 --> 09:14.846
Are you talking about Dixie?

09:14.929 --> 09:16.389
Patty's still in.

09:16.848 --> 09:20.268
We went straight to Pastor Mike
and confessed about the sex tape.

09:20.351 --> 09:23.146
He let her off with a slap on the wrist.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.398
Barnard! Six hard wieners

09:25.482 --> 09:28.985
- and an order of Ween Rings!
- Oh, that's you, Bob "Blackmail" Barnard.

09:29.069 --> 09:29.944
Barnard!

09:30.028 --> 09:32.697
I'm coming. I heard you the first time.

09:41.998 --> 09:44.084
<i>Roxy was Stella Rose's daughter?</i>

09:44.167 --> 09:47.378
<i>I practically soiled
my low-rise Calvin Klein boxer briefs.</i>

09:49.214 --> 09:52.675
<i>If Stella Rose was Roxy's mom,
could I be her...?</i>

09:52.759 --> 09:54.094
Who's Roxy's father?

09:54.719 --> 09:55.887
I'm sorry?

09:56.346 --> 09:58.431
She's going to the gym, Mom.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.935
- Why didn't you tell me?
- It never came up.

10:02.018 --> 10:04.562
Is she mine? I did the math.
Twenty years ago,

10:04.646 --> 10:06.064
- you and I...
- Drop it, Bob.

10:07.440 --> 10:11.194
This lunch is over,
just like your pageant career.

10:14.656 --> 10:18.535
<i>Could it be possible that all these years
I had another daughter</i>

10:18.618 --> 10:20.161
<i>and I never even knew?</i>

10:26.417 --> 10:30.880
<i>If Roxy was mine, any hope of saving
my marriage would be a distant memory.</i>

10:30.964 --> 10:33.591
<i>I couldn't speak to Coralee
until I knew the truth.</i>

10:41.933 --> 10:43.768
Wakey-wakey.

10:43.852 --> 10:45.019
Drinky-drinky.

10:45.103 --> 10:47.105
- No, it's too hot.
- Snap out of it.

10:47.564 --> 10:48.690
Oh!

10:48.773 --> 10:51.109
You could have popped out my veneers!

10:51.192 --> 10:54.028
- Your what?
- The covers on my two front teeth.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.656
They were all messed up
when my mama found me.

10:56.739 --> 10:58.616
They're shaved like
shark teeth under there.

10:58.700 --> 11:01.077
- Gross.
- You're gross. Drink your coffee.

11:04.789 --> 11:07.125
I'm not stupid! I'm smart!

11:07.208 --> 11:10.170
I know how to slice tomatoes,
and I know how to wear a backpack.

11:10.253 --> 11:11.588
Stop yelling.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.509
Let me cool that off for you.

11:17.719 --> 11:18.761
I'll be right back.

11:20.555 --> 11:23.558
You know, at my house,
we got these special little ice trays,

11:23.641 --> 11:26.978
and you can make ice cubes
of all cute little shapes and sizes.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.063
Oh, we got hearts,

11:29.147 --> 11:32.358
and we've got some stars and unicorns,

11:32.442 --> 11:34.736
and, um... oh, we got balls.

11:35.111 --> 11:37.030
Little balls, big balls, medium balls.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.449
Here you go, sister.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.326
We're not sisters.

11:41.743 --> 11:42.744
You're right.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.788
From now on,
it's every Barnard for herself.

11:59.344 --> 12:01.262
- I'm really glad you called.
- Mm.

12:01.679 --> 12:04.641
Yeah, I wasn't sure
it was going to happen.

12:05.767 --> 12:10.063
I dialed up your number
and hung up about 72 times.

12:10.521 --> 12:12.732
Yeah, I know. Caller ID.

12:15.360 --> 12:18.738
Relax, it's only a date.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.865
I'm not asking you to shave your head,

12:20.949 --> 12:23.076
order the NFL package,
and get a cat together.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.036
Yeah, can we not call it a date?

12:33.336 --> 12:34.212
Hey, you okay?

12:34.295 --> 12:36.130
Do you know the Bible is 1200 pages long?

12:36.214 --> 12:38.132
Uh, cool.

12:38.216 --> 12:40.635
Look, I know we haven't spoken
since the confession,

12:40.718 --> 12:42.387
but I need your help.

12:42.470 --> 12:46.015
They added a last-minute Bible Trivia Quiz
to Miss Magic Jesus, and I'm screwed.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.016
Hang on.

12:48.017 --> 12:50.979
Did you know they added
a Bible Trivia Quiz to Miss Magic Jesus?

12:51.062 --> 12:52.855
Yeah. But I know that shit cold.

12:52.939 --> 12:55.149
<i>Nonnie, I'm freaking out.</i>

12:55.233 --> 12:57.860
Bob's already pissed at me
about the whole sex tape thing, and I...

12:57.944 --> 12:59.445
Wait. What sex tape?

12:59.529 --> 13:01.698
<i>Long story.
I'll tell you when you get here.</i>

13:01.781 --> 13:03.616
Come over and help me study? Please.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.287
I'll be right there.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.834
Sorry, I'm gonna have to take
a rain check.

13:13.751 --> 13:14.961
Patty needs me.

13:16.546 --> 13:18.464
So, just to be clear.

13:18.548 --> 13:21.843
Is this not a date because
you wanna ease into the girl thing,

13:21.926 --> 13:24.429
or is it because
you're still hung up on Patty?

13:30.393 --> 13:31.519
You know what?

13:32.145 --> 13:34.147
She can figure it out on her own.

13:34.439 --> 13:35.440
That's my girl.

13:36.858 --> 13:39.736
Uh... Not "my girl," I mean...

13:40.570 --> 13:42.322
- Well...
- Babe, relax.

13:42.613 --> 13:43.656
It's just a date.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.117
Sex tape? This is my worst nightmare.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.995
I know, which is why I called
this emergency meeting.

13:49.078 --> 13:51.372
- Will you help me out?
- Who's the guy?

13:51.456 --> 13:52.373
I don't know.

13:52.457 --> 13:55.585
But I do know that when teens act out,

13:55.668 --> 13:58.004
it is time to start looking
at their home life.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.673
So you're saying this is my fault.

14:00.757 --> 14:05.887
Of course not. You are a shining example
of chastity and self-control.

14:05.970 --> 14:08.139
Look, it's not all on you.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.683
What's Patty's relationship like
with her dad?

14:10.767 --> 14:13.227
I... I don't know who he is.

14:13.603 --> 14:15.855
And what was your relationship like
with your own dad?

14:15.938 --> 14:17.857
He ran off when I was in kindergarten.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.734
And did your mom ever date?

14:19.817 --> 14:21.235
Were there other men in the house?

14:21.778 --> 14:23.029
She had a boyfriend.

14:23.571 --> 14:24.405
Gordy.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.408
Uh, he lived with us until I was 13.

14:27.492 --> 14:29.911
What age did you start
acting out sexually?

14:30.870 --> 14:31.788
Fourteen.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.707
Promiscuity, fairly common
among young women

14:34.791 --> 14:37.627
who suffer from a lack
of father-daughter connection.

14:37.960 --> 14:41.130
Now, if it were me,
I would encourage Patty

14:41.214 --> 14:44.092
to lean into her positive
male role models.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.177
- If she had any.
- She does.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.221
Bob is her godfather.

14:48.304 --> 14:51.057
Encourage him
to be as involved as possible.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.267
And limit negative male influences.

14:53.351 --> 14:55.937
Which means, whoever is on that sex tape,

14:56.020 --> 14:58.356
keep Patty as far away from him
as possible.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.108
Saul became the Apostle Paul.

15:00.191 --> 15:02.610
<i>When Nonnie blew me off,
I reached out to Christian.</i>

15:02.693 --> 15:05.071
<i>Who better to help me learn the Bible
than a pastor's son?</i>

15:05.405 --> 15:06.406
Are you listening?

15:07.490 --> 15:09.742
Mm-hm. Sorry. Sorry.

15:10.284 --> 15:12.078
I just can't believe Nonnie blew me off.

15:12.161 --> 15:13.371
She's in love with you.

15:13.704 --> 15:16.249
You don't feel the same way.
Things are bound to change.

15:16.457 --> 15:18.751
Yeah, but we've been best friends
since we were three.

15:18.835 --> 15:20.670
She knows me the best out of anyone.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.589
Maybe we should get
to know each other better.

15:30.054 --> 15:33.015
Stop. This is how we got in trouble
in the first place.

15:33.099 --> 15:36.310
Bob's already so mad at me,
and if I blow the pageant,

15:36.394 --> 15:37.770
it'll make it even worse.

15:37.854 --> 15:38.771
We need to study.

15:38.855 --> 15:41.983
I could just steal the quiz questions
from my dad's computer.

15:44.318 --> 15:47.155
Cheating in a Jesus pageant
seems especially sinful.

15:47.238 --> 15:50.074
If God can forgive murder...

15:51.117 --> 15:55.538
then stealing quiz answers is no big deal.

15:56.164 --> 15:57.832
Hey!

15:57.915 --> 16:00.042
I rang the doorbell, but nobody...

16:00.126 --> 16:01.794
What...? What is he doing here?

16:01.878 --> 16:03.713
He's helping. Give him a chance.

16:04.797 --> 16:08.092
Christian has the inside track on what
Pastor Mike might be asking on the quiz.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.303
Inside track?

16:10.678 --> 16:12.430
I hope you two are not cheating.

16:12.889 --> 16:14.348
No, definitely not.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.143
- How'd it go with Stella Rose?
- Complicated.

16:17.727 --> 16:19.479
Christian, give us a minute?

16:19.562 --> 16:21.272
Sure. I'll go grab a soda.

16:27.236 --> 16:29.530
I came to drop off your dress
and the steamer.

16:29.614 --> 16:32.325
You will need to de-wrinkle
your Sunday best dress yourself.

16:32.408 --> 16:35.620
- I have something I need to take care of.
- Wait. Are you blowing me off

16:35.703 --> 16:38.539
'cause you're still mad at me about
the sex tape? 'Cause I can do better.

16:38.956 --> 16:40.416
Roxy is Stella Rose's daughter.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.001
No way.

16:42.084 --> 16:43.294
I think I'm her father.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.546
- What?
- Roxy's 19.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.173
The math adds up...

16:47.965 --> 16:49.217
and it makes sense.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.469
Stella Rose and I
would make the perfect pageant girl.

16:52.136 --> 16:54.305
You think Roxy's perfect?
But what about me?

16:55.014 --> 16:56.265
This isn't about you.

16:56.349 --> 16:59.310
Of course it is. Today is the biggest day
of my pageant career.

16:59.393 --> 17:02.313
Yeah, and if Roxy's mine,
this could be the biggest day of my life.

17:03.314 --> 17:06.733
I have to get Roxy alone and find out what
she knows before she gets out of town.

17:07.068 --> 17:10.112
Can't you just, like, wait?
The pageant is just hours away.

17:10.195 --> 17:12.906
If Roxy is mine,
I cannot wait another minute.

17:12.990 --> 17:15.867
Look, I know this timing is terrible.

17:15.952 --> 17:17.118
I am sorry.

17:17.203 --> 17:20.748
But I promise I will be back
to do your hair and makeup.

17:21.415 --> 17:24.627
<i>If perfect Roxy
was really Bob's flesh and blood,</i>

17:24.710 --> 17:26.587
<i>he would ditch me for sure.</i>

17:27.755 --> 17:31.259
<i>Unless I could show him
I was a real contender.</i>

17:33.594 --> 17:34.428
What was that about?

17:37.306 --> 17:38.558
Steal the quiz answers.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.102
What Bob doesn't know won't hurt him.

17:41.185 --> 17:44.230
Now, we just need to make sure
Magnolia wins.

17:44.313 --> 17:46.691
- I'm not sure I can go through with it.
- You...

17:48.401 --> 17:52.071
Now, you and I both know
you wanna take down Bob Armstrong.

17:52.154 --> 17:56.450
And the best way to do that
is to make sure Patty loses.

17:56.534 --> 17:58.995
- Now, I need the answers to that quiz.
- Why?

17:59.787 --> 18:01.414
If Magnolia's unbeatable...

18:01.497 --> 18:04.584
I still wanna give her every advantage.
She's my daughter.

18:04.667 --> 18:07.420
Yeah. You're father of the year.

18:10.339 --> 18:13.342
So, what do you think of Masonville's
signature food item?

18:14.176 --> 18:15.928
More delicious than it should be.

18:16.012 --> 18:17.805
Told you. It's the cumin mayo.

18:18.556 --> 18:19.640
Hey, hun.

18:20.182 --> 18:22.560
Dad. What are you doing here?

18:22.643 --> 18:24.520
Getting some food
for the boys at the station.

18:24.604 --> 18:25.688
What are you up to?

18:26.689 --> 18:28.107
I'm having lunch with...

18:30.151 --> 18:31.068
With...

18:32.945 --> 18:34.822
Dee. My name is Dee.

18:34.905 --> 18:37.491
It's nice to meet you, Dee.
I'm Hank.

18:37.575 --> 18:38.451
Hi.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.828
Dee's a friend, a new friend.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.247
Oh, you girls go to school together?

18:43.331 --> 18:45.625
I go to Emory.
I'm just in town for the pageant.

18:46.042 --> 18:47.376
We met at a coffee shop...

18:47.960 --> 18:49.503
where I was drinking coffee...

18:50.004 --> 18:50.921
with Choi...

18:51.505 --> 18:52.465
who's a guy.

18:54.634 --> 18:57.637
Well, I don't really care
who you have coffee with, guys or girls.

18:58.721 --> 19:01.098
Why don't I stay for a minute,
get to know your new friend?

19:01.182 --> 19:02.350
No, thanks, we're good.

19:03.100 --> 19:06.145
- Or you could have Dee over for dinner.
- Dee has Miss Magic Jesus.

19:06.812 --> 19:09.690
Nonnie, why don't you and I
go together to support her?

19:09.774 --> 19:11.651
Been a while since we had
a daddy-daughter date,

19:11.734 --> 19:13.569
and I would love to see
your new friend compete.

19:14.236 --> 19:15.863
- Nice to meet you, Dee.
- You, too.

19:15.946 --> 19:17.031
See you tonight, hun?

19:20.159 --> 19:21.827
You know he knows this is a date.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.996
He was doing everything he could
to let you know.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.540
What? That's not true.

19:26.624 --> 19:29.502
- You could have just told him.
- No. If I tell him, that means I'm...

19:29.585 --> 19:31.962
What? Gay?

19:32.046 --> 19:33.381
Perish the thought.

19:33.714 --> 19:35.800
I don't know that I am, okay?

19:36.300 --> 19:39.345
But I do know that I'm not ready
to open up that whole can of worms

19:39.428 --> 19:41.597
unless I know that this is, like...

19:41.681 --> 19:43.432
- a thing.
- Uh-huh.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.394
And when will you know if this is a thing?

19:47.311 --> 19:48.604
Ask me after the date?

19:51.065 --> 19:52.733
You're lucky you're cute.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.573
<i>Roxy's text said
she'd be at the gym.</i>

19:59.657 --> 20:01.992
<i>I had to find out
what she knew about her dad.</i>

20:02.076 --> 20:04.578
<i>But, because of my history
with Stella Rose,</i>

20:04.662 --> 20:06.288
<i>it would be tricky to get her to talk.</i>

20:06.956 --> 20:09.375
<i>Luckily, I was seasoned
at questioning witnesses,</i>

20:09.458 --> 20:12.253
<i>so if anyone could get a confession,
it was me.</i>

20:12.336 --> 20:14.130
<i>I just had to find a way in.</i>

20:14.213 --> 20:16.966
Roxy, what a nice surprise!

20:17.049 --> 20:20.594
That I'm working out
in the only gym in town? Suck it, Bob.

20:20.678 --> 20:22.012
Oh, shit!

20:22.096 --> 20:25.182
You distracted me, I went 15 seconds over
my 30-minute workout. Now I have to...

20:25.266 --> 20:28.644
Go to 40, 'cause you gotta
end your workout on a zero minute.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.396
Yeah. How did you...?

20:30.479 --> 20:33.232
I have the same odd OCD thing.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.569
Drives my wife and kids crazy.

20:36.652 --> 20:39.530
That's nuts.
I've never met anyone else who has that.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.782
<i>Was it a happy accident,</i>

20:41.866 --> 20:44.618
<i>or evidence that she was
the fruit of my loins?</i>

20:44.702 --> 20:47.580
I just found out that
you're Stella Rose's daughter,

20:47.663 --> 20:51.625
and I wanna know who your dad is.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.879
I have no idea
who my biological father is.

20:56.255 --> 20:59.925
I only found out Stella Rose
is my biological mom a year ago.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.011
She put me up for adoption,

21:02.094 --> 21:04.597
and I went searching for her
when I turned 18.

21:04.889 --> 21:09.685
She said my bio dad died in an accident,
but it was too painful to talk about.

21:13.939 --> 21:18.819
<i>Stella Rose might be a liar,
but DNA always tells the truth.</i>

21:20.404 --> 21:23.991
Oh, shit!
I just got called into the office.

21:24.074 --> 21:26.035
Figures. Didn't even break a sweat.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.162
Let me get you a fresh towel.

21:38.214 --> 21:40.090
- You made a sex tape?
- What?

21:40.925 --> 21:42.760
- How did you...?
- Pastor Mike told me.

21:43.010 --> 21:46.430
- Does he know who the guy is?
- No. It doesn't matter.

21:46.722 --> 21:48.015
He's concerned.

21:48.516 --> 21:50.142
And honestly, so am I.

21:52.770 --> 21:54.730
Look, I'm not judging you.

22:00.277 --> 22:01.237
I've been there.

22:02.738 --> 22:05.783
When I was your age,
I thought it was a badge of honor

22:05.866 --> 22:07.868
to have sex with a bunch of guys.

22:07.952 --> 22:11.080
- It was just one guy, and we never...
- And it ended up getting me pregnant,

22:11.497 --> 22:15.459
and not having an answer for you
when you asked me who your daddy was.

22:16.043 --> 22:19.588
And I think that's why
you're acting like this, like me.

22:20.214 --> 22:23.884
And so, I'm so sorry...
just for all of it.

22:25.719 --> 22:28.806
I probably acted out
'cause my dad abandoned me.

22:28.889 --> 22:33.686
So I thought, well,
that's what men do, they leave.

22:33.769 --> 22:36.605
Yeah, well, you were right, they do.
Bob abandoned me.

22:37.147 --> 22:39.692
Today. On the biggest day
of my pageant career.

22:39.775 --> 22:41.861
He thinks he might have a daughter
he never knew about,

22:41.944 --> 22:45.447
- so he's off trying to figure it out.
- Well, you can still win without Bob.

22:45.531 --> 22:46.657
No, I can't!

22:46.740 --> 22:47.992
If I don't win Miss Magic Jesus,

22:48.075 --> 22:50.160
then Bob won't think that
I'm the perfect pageant girl.

22:50.244 --> 22:53.080
And then he'll blow me off and I'll never
get to go to Miss American Lady.

22:53.163 --> 22:54.665
- Patty, calm down.
- I can't.

22:56.250 --> 22:59.295
I did something bad,
just to make sure that I would win.

23:05.509 --> 23:10.431
So there's nothing you can tell me
that I haven't already done.

23:11.390 --> 23:12.349
Have you ever...?

23:15.227 --> 23:16.604
Have you ever cheated?

23:16.687 --> 23:18.898
On guys? All the time.

23:18.981 --> 23:20.691
No, on a quiz.

23:21.692 --> 23:25.738
I just sent Christian to go steal
the answers for the pageant Bible quiz.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.991
Do you think I'm a horrible person?

23:31.744 --> 23:33.329
I think you're an amazing person.

23:34.914 --> 23:37.041
Which is why I don't think
you should cheat.

23:38.042 --> 23:43.088
If you cheat and win, you'll never know
if you could have done it for real.

23:43.172 --> 23:46.008
Don't sell yourself short
just because Bob let you down.

23:46.216 --> 23:50.304
Look, I was a straight-D student,
and I don't know dick about Jesus,

23:50.679 --> 23:53.390
but if you won't cheat...

23:55.225 --> 23:56.602
I'll be your study buddy.

23:58.354 --> 23:59.438
What do you say?

24:02.274 --> 24:08.030
I say... maybe don't say
"dick" and "Jesus" in the same sentence?

24:24.546 --> 24:25.714
What are you doing?

24:26.131 --> 24:29.843
- Why is my computer open to the quiz?
- I, uh... I was curious.

24:29.927 --> 24:30.886
Get out of there!

24:34.640 --> 24:35.933
Tell me the truth.

24:36.016 --> 24:38.936
- You know I can tell when you're lying.
- I'm not. I just...

24:39.103 --> 24:40.145
No, wait.

24:40.229 --> 24:41.146
Wait, don't.

24:42.856 --> 24:44.483
Damn it. Who is she?

24:44.900 --> 24:47.027
- Who?
- Stop lying!

24:47.111 --> 24:49.488
You are stealing the answers for a girl.

24:49.738 --> 24:52.825
Now we are not gonna
have another situation. Are we?

24:52.908 --> 24:53.993
Dad, come on.

24:54.076 --> 24:54.910
No, you come on!

24:54.994 --> 24:58.247
I have spent months
defending you to your mother,

24:58.330 --> 25:02.251
insisting that you're a good kid,
even after what went down in Brazil.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.335
But she was right...

25:05.004 --> 25:06.547
maybe you can't be saved.

25:07.423 --> 25:09.383
Don't say that.
I just need another chance.

25:09.466 --> 25:10.968
I am done defending you.

25:11.719 --> 25:13.095
It's up to your mother now.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.975
Magnolia! Where are you?

25:19.435 --> 25:20.811
Drinking coffee.

25:20.894 --> 25:21.770
Want a sip?

25:22.021 --> 25:23.439
- Oh...
- Hey.

25:24.273 --> 25:25.107
Hey.

25:25.190 --> 25:26.233
Dixie!

25:26.817 --> 25:28.902
- Come here, sit down. Sit down.
- Ugh...

25:29.611 --> 25:31.947
- Yes, Daddy?
- I told you to get her hydrated.

25:32.031 --> 25:33.157
This is full of booze.

25:33.240 --> 25:36.577
She must have gotten into
the liquor cabinet when I wasn't watching!

25:37.036 --> 25:40.914
You know what they say,
alcoholics always find a way.

25:40.998 --> 25:44.043
Go get me the Alka-Seltzer Plus
from the upstairs bedroom.

25:47.504 --> 25:50.466
Come on, Magnolia, this is your future
we're talking about.

25:50.549 --> 25:53.218
If you blow this,
you could lose your sponsor,

25:53.302 --> 25:56.221
and then there goes any chance
of a college scholarship.

25:56.305 --> 25:57.389
Scholarship?

25:57.473 --> 25:59.808
Since when are you worried
about a scholarship?

26:02.227 --> 26:04.772
I'm worried about my winner.

26:05.314 --> 26:06.732
This isn't like you.

26:07.649 --> 26:12.362
Hey, are you gonna let Fatty Patty
steal this pageant from you too?

26:12.988 --> 26:14.031
No.

26:15.157 --> 26:17.493
- I hate that bitch.
- Good.

26:17.826 --> 26:19.369
Then get your head in the game.

26:19.953 --> 26:20.829
Here.

26:22.372 --> 26:23.207
What's this?

26:23.290 --> 26:24.374
The answers.

26:25.209 --> 26:26.335
To the Jesus quiz.

26:28.087 --> 26:31.882
I know what it feels like when
the chips are down. But we Barnards,

26:31.965 --> 26:34.176
we can always turn things around.

26:34.259 --> 26:36.929
Sometimes all it takes is a win.

26:53.570 --> 26:56.365
<i>Hey, it's Bob Armstrong. Leave a message.</i>

26:56.448 --> 26:59.493
Bob, it's Angie, Patty's mom.

26:59.576 --> 27:02.579
Patty tells me you're out finding out
if you have another daughter.

27:02.663 --> 27:04.123
Well, let me tell you something.

27:04.206 --> 27:06.583
You're the closest thing
Patty has to a dad,

27:06.667 --> 27:09.211
and I will not stand for her
to be abandoned again.

27:09.294 --> 27:13.340
So, if you don't get yourself
to that pageant in 30 minutes,

27:13.423 --> 27:15.926
I'm gonna go full Mama Bear on your ass.

27:16.844 --> 27:17.719
Bye.

27:22.349 --> 27:26.645
<i>The pageant was starting soon.
I couldn't believe Bob was still MIA.</i>

27:27.688 --> 27:30.941
Watch out, Miss Magic J.
We're here today and we're here to play.

27:31.024 --> 27:33.777
Thanks, Dad, for your help.

27:34.319 --> 27:35.779
I'm gonna go set up my station.

27:37.281 --> 27:40.492
- How'd you get her to pull it together?
- Well, we had a come to Jesus.

27:42.619 --> 27:44.246
What did he say?

27:44.329 --> 27:45.205
He...

27:46.290 --> 27:47.124
That...

27:47.416 --> 27:48.709
That's not what that...

27:52.713 --> 27:54.464
- Ow.
- Ugh... I'm sorry.

27:54.548 --> 27:56.466
I'm just not used to doing this
on someone else.

27:56.550 --> 27:59.178
It's not your job. Bob should be here.

27:59.553 --> 28:00.637
He will be.

28:01.180 --> 28:04.057
Hey. I'm sorry
I couldn't help you earlier.

28:04.600 --> 28:07.853
Well, I'm glad you're here now.
I need my bestie to cheer me on.

28:07.936 --> 28:08.979
She's cheering for me.

28:09.813 --> 28:13.901
Dee is the girl I told you about,
the one who asked me out.

28:13.984 --> 28:16.570
Oh. Uh... So is this a thing?

28:16.653 --> 28:18.572
- Yeah.
- It is?

28:19.865 --> 28:21.200
Oh. Um...

28:21.825 --> 28:23.368
I thought our date went well.

28:23.452 --> 28:25.078
But if you disagree...

28:31.168 --> 28:34.087
Come on, let's set up
my station somewhere else.

28:34.171 --> 28:35.881
I don't like the energy over here.

28:38.425 --> 28:42.304
It is about time
Nonnie came out.

28:42.387 --> 28:45.265
But I gotta be honest, I always
thought she was in love with you.

28:45.349 --> 28:46.767
Guess who?

28:46.850 --> 28:50.771
I am so sorry,
I should have been here earlier.

28:50.854 --> 28:53.106
I didn't mean to make you
feel abandoned on your big day.

28:53.190 --> 28:54.107
Where were you?

28:54.816 --> 28:56.652
Getting a DNA test for Roxy.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.487
- And?
- Still waiting on the results.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.155
I just wanna talk to you for a second.

29:03.492 --> 29:07.871
I got your message, and I want you to know
I would never abandon Patty.

29:08.038 --> 29:11.708
I need you to promise me
that if you're in Patty's life,

29:12.167 --> 29:13.001
she's safe.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.211
Yeah, of course she's safe.

29:14.294 --> 29:18.006
I want you to show up for Patty
like you would your own daughter.

29:23.512 --> 29:26.556
Come on, let's hot roll that hair
and win this thing.

29:26.640 --> 29:28.350
<i>It was all about me, for now.</i>

29:28.433 --> 29:30.644
<i>But what about when
he got the DNA results?</i>

29:30.727 --> 29:33.647
<i>I needed to show him
I was just as good as Roxy,</i>

29:33.730 --> 29:36.024
<i>which meant I needed to win.</i>

30:18.400 --> 30:20.485
<i>Stone cold chillin', JC</i>

30:20.569 --> 30:21.820
<i>JC, just you and me</i>

30:21.903 --> 30:23.447
<i>Chill, chill, chillin', you see</i>

30:24.114 --> 30:25.574
<i>By the Sea of Galilee</i>

30:25.657 --> 30:27.951
<i>I got a notion
That this motion by the ocean</i>

30:28.035 --> 30:28.952
<i>Is the potion I need</i>

30:29.036 --> 30:31.621
<i>I think you get the gist
You the top of my list</i>

30:31.705 --> 30:32.581
<i>State of bliss</i>

30:32.664 --> 30:33.707
<i>Eucharist</i>

30:33.790 --> 30:35.083
<i>Swear to God I need a fix</i>

30:35.167 --> 30:36.585
<i>State of bliss, crucifix</i>

30:36.668 --> 30:38.086
<i>Thank you, Jesus, that's my mix</i>

30:40.047 --> 30:41.214
That's my girlfriend.

30:43.592 --> 30:45.302
And now for the second coming.

31:13.663 --> 31:15.374
<i>The pageant seemed unwinnable.</i>

31:15.457 --> 31:18.752
<i>Between Stella Rose being a judge,
the Bible pop quiz,</i>

31:18.835 --> 31:23.715
<i>invincible Magnolia Barnard,
and now Dee with her mad rapping skills...</i>

31:23.799 --> 31:25.801
<i>Jesus better be deep inside me.</i>

31:25.884 --> 31:28.178
<i>I needed all the help I could get.</i>

31:28.261 --> 31:29.596
<i>That hat needs work.</i>

31:30.013 --> 31:31.014
It's too plain Jane.

31:31.098 --> 31:33.975
You'll disappear on stage
like a sinner on Judgment Day.

31:34.059 --> 31:36.520
You liked it at the store.
Maybe if you were here sooner...

31:36.603 --> 31:37.437
Hat, please.

31:40.357 --> 31:42.484
Oh, hey, Patty. Bob.

31:42.567 --> 31:43.485
Oh, damn it!

31:43.568 --> 31:46.947
Roxy, what are you doing backstage?

31:47.030 --> 31:48.281
All-access pass.

31:48.824 --> 31:51.076
Oh, that looks great, Bob.

31:51.660 --> 31:53.870
Almost jealous you're not my coach.

31:54.621 --> 31:55.705
Not even done yet.

31:56.498 --> 31:58.083
He's really trying to focus, so...

31:58.166 --> 32:01.545
You know, I thought
Magnolia was the one to beat,

32:01.962 --> 32:05.215
- but now I'm rooting for you.
- Really?

32:05.298 --> 32:10.220
Crushing you on the big stage
at regionals would be super satisfying.

32:11.096 --> 32:12.139
Good luck out there.

32:14.057 --> 32:15.892
Did you hear what she just... Oh!

32:15.976 --> 32:18.437
Now that is Sunday at its best.

32:20.397 --> 32:23.483
Mm-hm. Now get out there and win!

32:26.027 --> 32:28.280
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

32:28.363 --> 32:32.659
It's now time for the Bible quiz
in which our five finalists

32:32.742 --> 32:34.536
will put their knowledge to the test.

32:34.619 --> 32:35.745
Ready, ladies?

32:36.079 --> 32:39.124
Which prophet declared himself to be

32:39.207 --> 32:41.918
"a man of unclean lips"?

32:42.919 --> 32:43.879
- Patty.
- Isaiah.

32:43.962 --> 32:44.796
Correct!

32:49.217 --> 32:53.930
Second question.
What lost item did the prophet Elijah

32:54.014 --> 32:57.601
cause to float
to the surface of the Jordan?

32:58.143 --> 32:59.561
- Magnolia!
- An ax head!

32:59.644 --> 33:01.104
- Correct!
- Micah!

33:01.188 --> 33:02.022
Samuel!

33:02.522 --> 33:03.523
Wild gourds!

33:04.024 --> 33:04.858
Joel!

33:05.859 --> 33:06.860
Correct.

33:10.030 --> 33:12.574
Did you see that? Magnolia kicked my ass.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.868
- Something's up with her.
- It's only a third of the score.

33:14.951 --> 33:17.037
You'll be fine.
You just gotta nail the interview.

33:17.120 --> 33:20.248
Remember what we talked about,
find a way to bring up the Resurrection.

33:20.332 --> 33:22.959
If anyone understands
a second shot at life, it's you.

33:23.043 --> 33:24.461
What is going on with your phone?

33:24.920 --> 33:27.672
Oh, sorry.
I'm just waiting on the DNA results.

33:28.757 --> 33:29.883
Bob, what if I win?

33:29.966 --> 33:31.426
That would be amazing.

33:31.510 --> 33:33.803
What if I win,
and Roxy's really your daughter,

33:33.887 --> 33:35.222
and we both go to regionals?

33:36.306 --> 33:37.307
Who will you root for?

33:37.390 --> 33:39.309
I guess I'll root for both of you.

33:39.392 --> 33:40.310
You can't.

33:40.393 --> 33:42.187
Only one of us can have the crown.

33:42.270 --> 33:46.191
<i>Please welcome back our finalists
for their last interview questions.</i>

33:50.862 --> 33:53.073
<i>Bob didn't even know
if Roxy was his daughter,</i>

33:53.156 --> 33:55.659
<i>and he was already giving her
all of his attention.</i>

33:55.742 --> 33:58.453
<i>I thought he would always be on my side.</i>

33:58.662 --> 34:00.163
<i>But maybe I was wrong.</i>

34:00.247 --> 34:02.207
...final round of competition.

34:02.290 --> 34:05.627
There can only be one winner
of the Crown of Thorns tonight.

34:05.710 --> 34:10.715
Only one of you can represent
the tenets of Miss Magic Jesus.

34:11.007 --> 34:16.929
So, let's dive a little bit deeper
into your relationship with the Big J.

34:17.013 --> 34:19.014
Each of our five finalists

34:19.099 --> 34:22.185
will step forward
and answer the question:

34:22.268 --> 34:25.355
How is Jesus inside of you?

34:26.106 --> 34:28.900
Jesus is the greens in my salad.

34:28.984 --> 34:31.235
I eat him with every meal.

34:31.527 --> 34:33.154
He's my superfood.

34:33.237 --> 34:34.739
Oh, kale-no.

34:35.322 --> 34:38.284
When people body-shame me,
Jesus is the cheerleader

34:38.368 --> 34:42.246
on the inside of me, chanting,
<i>Dee, Dee, listen to me</i>

34:42.330 --> 34:43.498
<i>Don't listen to that rot</i>

34:43.581 --> 34:45.458
<i>Your body is rockin'
Your body is hot</i>

34:46.042 --> 34:48.460
Jesus is my drug of choice.
He gets me high.

34:48.545 --> 34:50.547
With him, I can fly.

34:50.630 --> 34:53.967
I breathe the Lord in and I am focused,
free and totally me.

34:55.176 --> 34:58.305
Jesus is like my inner personal trainer.

34:58.388 --> 35:02.017
He inspires me with his perfect abs
and his rockin' hair.

35:04.102 --> 35:05.729
God help us all.

35:06.563 --> 35:10.400
Patty, how is Jesus inside of you?

35:16.364 --> 35:17.657
I never knew my dad.

35:18.908 --> 35:20.785
He abandoned me before I was born.

35:22.412 --> 35:28.293
And I've, um... been looking for someone
to take his place ever since.

35:29.169 --> 35:31.713
I thought I'd found
the perfect father figure,

35:32.631 --> 35:35.967
someone who would
stick by my side, always.

35:38.011 --> 35:39.471
Now I'm not so sure.

35:41.014 --> 35:43.433
I don't know if Jesus is inside me...

35:45.226 --> 35:48.146
but I do know his father
never abandoned him.

35:49.105 --> 35:51.274
Well, maybe for, like,
a second on the cross.

35:51.358 --> 35:54.694
But then he was resurrected
three days later by the Father.

35:54.778 --> 35:57.572
I mean, that's pretty much
the greatest dad moment, like, ever.

35:59.199 --> 36:04.079
So if Jesus, or God, or the Holy Spirit

36:04.871 --> 36:08.500
can be a father that never abandons me...

36:12.003 --> 36:13.046
I'm all in.

36:28.478 --> 36:31.648
<i>I was in the top three,
which meant I could actually win.</i>

36:33.817 --> 36:35.819
And the winner is...

36:41.074 --> 36:44.536
- Magnolia Barnard!
- Yes! Yes!

36:58.216 --> 37:00.301
<i>Sure, I was first runner-up,</i>

37:00.552 --> 37:03.054
<i>but second place was first loser.</i>

37:03.304 --> 37:06.766
<i>Everything I had worked for
was over, everything.</i>

37:10.353 --> 37:11.855
<i>Of course Magnolia won.</i>

37:12.063 --> 37:15.442
<i>She had a father,
one that was always there for her.</i>

37:15.650 --> 37:18.319
<i>I never even thought about
doing pageants before Bob.</i>

37:18.570 --> 37:21.614
<i>And if I couldn't count on him,
then what was the point?</i>

37:27.996 --> 37:29.539
Patty, I am so sorry...

37:29.622 --> 37:30.540
Save it, Bob.

37:31.166 --> 37:33.626
I would have won if you had
actually shown up for me.

37:36.671 --> 37:37.839
Bob Armstrong.

37:38.548 --> 37:40.175
You got the DNA results?

37:40.383 --> 37:41.968
- I quit.
- Patty, wait.

37:44.304 --> 37:45.388
What'd you find out?

37:51.352 --> 37:53.688
<i>Bob was supposed to be
my godfather,</i>

37:53.772 --> 37:56.065
<i>responsible for me
for the rest of my life,</i>

37:56.149 --> 37:58.777
<i>but he couldn't even make it through
Miss Magic Jesus.</i>

37:58.860 --> 38:01.780
<i>My mom was right,
I couldn't count on any man.</i>

38:11.539 --> 38:12.540
Christian?

38:13.041 --> 38:14.751
Hey, what are you...?

38:17.295 --> 38:18.630
My parents are done with me.

38:19.339 --> 38:21.174
They wanna send me to military school.

38:21.508 --> 38:23.968
So I'm skipping town, tonight.

38:25.637 --> 38:27.889
Of course you are. Everyone leaves.

38:28.389 --> 38:29.516
I want you to come with me.

38:31.226 --> 38:32.227
Seriously?

38:33.812 --> 38:35.438
- Where?
- Hollywood.

38:36.272 --> 38:38.650
I wanna go to the Whisky,
the Rainbow Room,

38:38.733 --> 38:41.110
see where Van Halen played,
Guns N' Roses.

38:41.194 --> 38:42.320
Oh, my God.

38:42.987 --> 38:44.322
Maybe I could meet Drew Barrymore.

38:44.948 --> 38:47.534
Patty... I promise,

38:47.617 --> 38:51.663
if you come with me,
I will never, ever leave you.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.835
It's late, Bob. What do you want?

38:56.918 --> 38:58.127
Answers.

39:01.089 --> 39:02.382
Roxy is your daughter.

39:06.177 --> 39:07.345
Did you know?

39:08.012 --> 39:08.930
Yes.

39:10.390 --> 39:11.808
Now so do you.

39:12.851 --> 39:16.396
I don't... understand.

39:16.479 --> 39:19.649
When did you and Stella Rose...?

39:19.732 --> 39:21.860
When you ended things with her
20 years ago,

39:21.943 --> 39:23.570
she tracked me down and seduced me.

39:23.653 --> 39:25.363
But why would she...?

39:25.446 --> 39:27.615
She wanted to get back at you
for breaking her heart.

39:27.699 --> 39:31.244
What better way than to sleep
with a guy you hated since high school?

39:31.703 --> 39:34.455
Hate is a strong word.

39:34.539 --> 39:37.041
Oh, come on, Bob,
everybody knows you hate me.

39:37.125 --> 39:39.294
It's as much a part of you
as your dad belly.

39:40.211 --> 39:43.464
She was gonna throw our affair
in your face,

39:43.965 --> 39:47.260
till she got pregnant
and her plan bit us both in the ass.

39:47.760 --> 39:51.180
I wasn't about to let it ruin my marriage
or the Barnard name,

39:51.264 --> 39:52.891
so I paid her to keep quiet.

39:52.974 --> 39:55.435
And to put Roxy up for adoption?

39:55.518 --> 39:57.186
Well, that was her choice.

39:57.353 --> 39:58.354
How'd you find out?

39:58.438 --> 40:02.650
I thought she might be mine,
so I ran a DNA test.

40:02.734 --> 40:06.446
Luckily for me, you're the DA
and your DNA's already in the system.

40:07.322 --> 40:09.032
How much is your silence worth?

40:09.115 --> 40:10.325
Oh, God.

40:13.286 --> 40:15.288
Not everyone has a price.

40:26.466 --> 40:27.800
Maybe you just need a win.

40:31.888 --> 40:35.558
I found this... Magnolia's things.

40:39.604 --> 40:41.564
It's the answers to the Jesus quiz.

40:43.191 --> 40:44.400
Magnolia cheated.

40:44.776 --> 40:47.612
If the pageant board found out,
she'd be disqualified.

40:47.695 --> 40:50.323
Patty was the first runner-up,
she'd get the crown.

40:50.531 --> 40:51.407
I can't.

40:52.659 --> 40:54.953
Magnolia will be devastated.

40:55.036 --> 40:56.663
It's just a pageant.

40:56.746 --> 41:01.125
If anyone finds out about Roxy,
it'll blow up my entire family.

41:01.501 --> 41:05.463
<i>Was he doing it to be a good dad,
or to protect his political career?</i>

41:05.546 --> 41:08.174
<i>I didn't care.
All I could see was the crown.</i>

41:11.260 --> 41:12.387
Come on, Bob.

41:13.471 --> 41:17.350
You know Magnolia's already
struggling with drugs and alcohol.

41:18.810 --> 41:20.311
I'm trying to protect her.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.064
If she finds this out...

41:25.525 --> 41:27.151
it could send her over the edge.

41:30.113 --> 41:33.449
Now, you... You wouldn't wanna
be responsible for that.

41:43.209 --> 41:45.420
She won!

41:45.586 --> 41:52.176
Magnolia got disqualified,
and Patty is Miss Magic Jesus!

41:52.635 --> 41:54.679
- Come on, let's go tell her.
- She's gone, Bob.

41:54.762 --> 41:57.015
What? Where...? Where is she?

41:57.098 --> 41:58.307
Well, I wish I knew.

41:58.391 --> 42:00.518
I just went to her room to check on her...

42:01.477 --> 42:02.520
and I found these.

42:09.861 --> 42:10.695
Daddy!

42:10.778 --> 42:12.488
Daddy, come quick!

42:12.572 --> 42:13.656
What is it?

42:14.532 --> 42:16.034
Hey, Mags.

42:16.451 --> 42:17.452
Baby, wake up.

42:17.910 --> 42:20.621
Wake up, baby girl. Call 911 now.

42:20.705 --> 42:23.207
Don't worry, Daddy,
we'll get through this as a family.

42:23.291 --> 42:25.543
Dixie, call 911 now!

42:26.085 --> 42:26.919
Now!

42:27.670 --> 42:30.089
Hey, sweetheart,
you gotta wake up and look at me.

42:30.173 --> 42:32.300
Come on, baby girl, look at me.

42:37.388 --> 42:39.265
I feel like Drew Barrymore in <i>Guncrazy.</i>

42:40.183 --> 42:41.601
Guess that makes me James Le Gros.

42:42.268 --> 42:43.686
Wait, you know that movie?

42:43.895 --> 42:47.106
No one knows that movie.
You are blowing my entire mind.

42:47.190 --> 42:48.608
Then I guess this is fate.

42:51.444 --> 42:52.695
We were meant to be.

43:10.505 --> 43:11.547
What was that?

43:12.256 --> 43:13.382
Anything important?

43:14.926 --> 43:15.802
No.

43:17.887 --> 43:18.846
Nothing at all.
