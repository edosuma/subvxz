WEBVTT

00:11.412 --> 00:12.845
- Okay.

00:12.880 --> 00:14.279
Here you go, babe.

00:14.315 --> 00:16.315
- Thank you.
- Great job.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.089
- Come on, bud.

00:24.125 --> 00:27.693
Superheroes have to
wear clothes to school.

00:33.334 --> 00:34.133
- Finished.

00:34.168 --> 00:35.234
Lunchbox?

00:35.269 --> 00:36.168
- Over there.

00:36.237 --> 00:37.002
- Alright.

00:37.071 --> 00:38.303
Backpack?

00:38.339 --> 00:39.138
- By the front door.

00:39.173 --> 00:40.406
- Great.

00:40.441 --> 00:42.808
But do you have
the latest edition

00:45.379 --> 00:46.979
of Science Tomorrow?

00:48.649 --> 00:50.149
- Thank you, thank
you, thank you!

00:51.385 --> 00:52.684
- Okay, one condition.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.253
If they change
Pluto's status again,

00:54.288 --> 00:55.621
you gotta let me down easy,

00:55.689 --> 00:58.357
because I am on a
rollercoaster of emotions.

00:59.860 --> 01:01.260
- We're running out of fuel!

01:01.295 --> 01:02.828
We have to land!

01:02.863 --> 01:05.564
Coming into a crash landing!

01:05.599 --> 01:06.832
Goosh!

01:06.867 --> 01:07.933
Okay.

01:08.002 --> 01:09.168
What next?

01:09.203 --> 01:10.002
- Books in the backpack!

01:10.037 --> 01:12.004
- Books in the backpack.

01:16.010 --> 01:17.142
- Pew, pew, pew!

01:17.178 --> 01:18.544
- Oh man, I know
a tiny superhero

01:18.579 --> 01:19.912
who's supposed to
get a dog today,

01:19.980 --> 01:21.680
but if we can't get
ready for school in time

01:21.715 --> 01:23.015
I don't know--

01:23.050 --> 01:26.718
- Oh no, I can do it, I
can do it, I can do it!

01:26.787 --> 01:27.786
- What else?

01:28.989 --> 01:30.622
Lunch!

01:30.658 --> 01:32.157
- Right.

01:32.193 --> 01:32.991
Thanks, Dad.

01:33.027 --> 01:33.926
- Here you go.

01:33.961 --> 01:34.793
- Thanks.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.196
- Today's the day!

01:37.264 --> 01:38.497
- Okay.

01:38.532 --> 01:42.134
So this is about the
dog presentation?

01:42.169 --> 01:43.001
Again?

01:45.005 --> 01:47.005
- As you know, today
is the final day

01:47.074 --> 01:49.241
of the pet adoption
at our school.

01:49.276 --> 01:50.476
- Mhm.

01:50.511 --> 01:53.445
- And this dog is the
best dog for our family.

01:53.481 --> 01:54.613
He's been in the shelter

01:54.648 --> 01:57.049
for a really, really long time,

01:57.084 --> 01:59.551
and he deserves a forever home.

01:59.587 --> 02:01.854
He's loyal, smart, playful,

02:04.291 --> 02:06.725
and he's really, really cute.

02:10.396 --> 02:12.231
- That is one cute dog.

02:12.266 --> 02:13.265
- Mom, please?

02:13.334 --> 02:15.601
Please can we get this dog?

02:15.669 --> 02:17.169
It's the last day.

02:19.173 --> 02:20.005
- Ugh.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.208
I don't know, Sophia.

02:23.244 --> 02:26.979
I mean, what am I
supposed to do, you know?

02:27.014 --> 02:29.982
About all of these dog toys

02:30.017 --> 02:33.185
if we don't go adopt
your dog today!

02:35.823 --> 02:36.655
Aw.

02:45.032 --> 02:46.031
- Morning.

02:46.100 --> 02:46.932
- Hey, babe.

02:46.967 --> 02:47.766
- Hey.

02:47.801 --> 02:48.600
- Hi, Bianca.

02:48.636 --> 02:49.434
Want some eggs?

02:49.470 --> 02:50.669
- I'll have a tiny bit.

02:50.738 --> 02:52.337
But I just came
by to say goodbye

02:52.406 --> 02:54.072
to you and your dad.

02:54.108 --> 02:55.240
- Where you going?

02:55.276 --> 02:57.976
- Um, my job is
sending me to Chicago.

02:58.012 --> 02:59.578
There's a huge court case.

02:59.613 --> 03:00.712
- With bad guy villains?

03:00.748 --> 03:01.880
- Yes.

03:01.916 --> 03:03.949
I have to fight
villains with paperwork.

03:03.984 --> 03:05.117
- Okay.

03:05.152 --> 03:06.285
Hey, Bianca, guess what?

03:06.320 --> 03:07.219
- What?

03:07.254 --> 03:09.488
- We're getting a dog today!

03:09.557 --> 03:10.355
- A dog?

03:11.692 --> 03:14.193
That is huge news,
are you so excited?

03:14.228 --> 03:16.094
- I am the most excited!

03:16.964 --> 03:18.530
- Awesome.

03:21.368 --> 03:22.834
- Bianca.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.236
- What?

03:24.271 --> 03:25.571
- Do you like dogs?

03:25.606 --> 03:26.838
- I love dogs.

03:26.874 --> 03:30.142
I am just very allergic to them.

03:30.177 --> 03:30.976
- What?

03:31.011 --> 03:31.810
Are you really?

03:31.845 --> 03:33.145
How did I not know this?

03:33.180 --> 03:35.714
- I don't know, I guess
it just never came out.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.149
- Hey, Owen, do
you want to go play

03:37.184 --> 03:39.251
with Awesome Patrol
Pals for five minutes?

03:39.320 --> 03:40.118
- Bye.

03:44.058 --> 03:45.123
- I feel so sorry.

03:45.159 --> 03:46.358
- No.

03:46.393 --> 03:48.727
- He's wanted a dog for
I don't know how long,

03:48.796 --> 03:49.595
and we just--

03:49.630 --> 03:50.929
- No, it's a no brainer.

03:50.965 --> 03:52.764
You get the dog, I'll
get some Benadryl.

03:52.800 --> 03:53.632
It's fine.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.203
- A whole month, huh?

03:58.272 --> 03:59.438
- I know.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.073
But I'll call you as
soon as I land tonight.

04:01.108 --> 04:02.574
- What time?

04:02.610 --> 04:03.976
I have the last day of the
PTA pet adoptions today,

04:04.011 --> 04:05.177
and we're actually
gonna bring the dog

04:05.246 --> 04:06.645
back here tonight
to get it adjusted,

04:06.680 --> 04:07.980
and then I still
have to take a peek

04:08.015 --> 04:09.715
at this project for
work before tomorrow,

04:09.750 --> 04:11.116
I go through the--

04:11.151 --> 04:12.951
- No wonder Owen is
obsessed with superheroes.

04:12.987 --> 04:14.486
He lives with one.

04:16.991 --> 04:18.223
- Thank you for being
so understanding

04:18.259 --> 04:20.858
of this whole "Superdad" thing.

04:20.894 --> 04:21.692
- Oh, please.

04:21.728 --> 04:23.128
Superdad is cute.

04:24.298 --> 04:25.864
- He may be cute,
but I understand

04:25.899 --> 04:28.033
that it's made us take things

04:28.068 --> 04:29.001
much more slowly,

04:29.036 --> 04:31.169
and I just want you to know that

04:31.205 --> 04:32.571
I appreciate your patience.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.941
- And I am more than
happy to do that.

04:36.010 --> 04:38.277
But I would like to know...

04:39.980 --> 04:42.247
- Right, where we are going.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.583
I get it.

04:44.652 --> 04:45.550
Okay, well I think
we're gonna use this

04:45.586 --> 04:47.753
time apart to think about us.

04:47.821 --> 04:48.887
- Yeah.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.356
Between career
altering court cases

04:51.392 --> 04:53.692
and PTA pet adoptions.

04:53.727 --> 04:54.860
- Superdad can handle it.

04:54.895 --> 04:58.363
- Okay.

05:10.744 --> 05:11.643
- Good job.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.412
Hey, hi, good morning.

05:13.447 --> 05:14.246
- Hey.

05:14.281 --> 05:15.347
- Hey, good morning!

05:15.416 --> 05:16.415
How are you?

05:43.544 --> 05:45.010
- No way.

05:45.045 --> 05:46.912
- Even added an itemized budget

05:46.947 --> 05:48.547
to appease Councilwoman Palisa.

05:48.582 --> 05:49.815
- Come on, man.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.317
You're making the
rest of us look bad.

05:52.353 --> 05:53.552
Thank you.

05:53.587 --> 05:54.653
Enjoy your lunch.

05:54.688 --> 05:55.687
- Thank you.

05:56.824 --> 05:57.622
Hey.

06:05.733 --> 06:06.531
- Hey.

06:06.567 --> 06:07.599
Brainstorm time?

06:07.634 --> 06:09.034
- Okay.

06:09.103 --> 06:10.035
One second.

06:11.205 --> 06:12.003
Hello?

06:12.039 --> 06:12.838
- Kate.

06:12.873 --> 06:13.839
Come see me please.

06:13.874 --> 06:14.673
- Okay.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.274
Yep, be right there.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.945
- Come in, take a seat.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.817
- Okay, but before
you say anything,

06:25.853 --> 06:27.152
I would just like to point out

06:27.221 --> 06:29.554
that I have a long track record

06:29.590 --> 06:32.057
of making excellent
films for this studio.

06:32.092 --> 06:33.492
- We know and--

06:33.560 --> 06:35.627
- And I believe that we
are the future of animation

06:35.662 --> 06:38.130
because we take risk, you know?

06:38.198 --> 06:39.765
And sometimes those risk are--

06:39.800 --> 06:41.266
- Can I just--

06:41.301 --> 06:44.102
- Ugh, which is why I just
wanted to reassure you--

06:44.138 --> 06:44.936
- Kate!

06:44.972 --> 06:46.438
- Yes, yes, yes.

06:46.473 --> 06:47.906
- We know.

06:47.941 --> 06:50.075
And I feel like I would
be doing you a disservice

06:50.110 --> 06:51.743
if I didn't tell
you that your short,

06:51.779 --> 06:53.445
"Light The Way",
has been accepted

06:53.514 --> 06:55.080
to the Georgia
Animation Festival,

06:55.115 --> 06:56.815
end of next month.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.316
- But the winner of that--

06:58.352 --> 07:00.318
- Qualifies to submit for
the Best Animated Short

07:00.354 --> 07:02.087
at the Oscars.

07:02.156 --> 07:03.255
- Are you serious?

07:03.323 --> 07:04.222
You're not serious.

07:04.258 --> 07:05.157
- Dead serious.

07:05.192 --> 07:06.591
We love it.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.693
And provided you rework
the ending as we discussed,

07:08.729 --> 07:10.695
we think this short
has the creative depth

07:10.731 --> 07:12.197
to go all the way.

07:12.232 --> 07:13.532
They already accepted you

07:13.567 --> 07:16.968
from a 30 second unfinished
clip we submitted.

07:19.473 --> 07:23.175
- I'm just gonna need
just two minutes.

07:23.210 --> 07:24.843
Just, okay.

07:24.878 --> 07:27.145
Okay, just two seconds.

07:27.181 --> 07:28.013
Okay.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.585
- I can hear you.

07:34.421 --> 07:35.821
- Okay.

07:35.856 --> 07:37.456
We are not gonna disappoint you,

07:37.491 --> 07:39.558
we are going to blow you away.

07:39.593 --> 07:40.392
- Kate.

07:40.427 --> 07:41.226
- Yeah.

07:41.261 --> 07:42.060
- Out of curiosity.

07:42.095 --> 07:42.961
- Yeah.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.496
- How is the ending coming?

07:44.565 --> 07:46.531
- It's a mess.

07:46.567 --> 07:50.235
It's a total mess.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.471
- Award season?

07:52.539 --> 07:53.305
Seriously?

07:53.373 --> 07:54.139
- Yes!

07:55.042 --> 07:55.807
- That's awesome!

07:55.876 --> 07:56.741
Yes!

07:56.777 --> 07:57.676
- Which means we have six weeks

07:57.711 --> 07:59.177
to come up with a new ending,

07:59.213 --> 08:01.012
and animate it.

08:01.048 --> 08:02.581
- Sorry, six weeks?

08:02.616 --> 08:03.582
- Yeah.

08:03.617 --> 08:04.416
- Cool.

08:04.451 --> 08:06.218
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

08:06.253 --> 08:07.385
- Welp.

08:07.421 --> 08:08.720
We're doomed.

08:08.755 --> 08:09.988
- No, come on!

08:10.023 --> 08:10.922
We're not doomed,
we're not doomed.

08:10.991 --> 08:11.923
You guys are some of the finest

08:11.992 --> 08:13.325
animators on the planet, okay?

08:13.360 --> 08:14.826
We got this.

08:14.862 --> 08:17.128
- Okay, in a sense, one
might say we do got this.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.797
As in we already have an ending.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.031
- No.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.132
- A perfect ending
that you keep.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.534
- And as the director,

08:22.569 --> 08:27.105
I'm gonna say that that
is the wrong direction.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.039
Yes, Jordan.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.007
- Sorry.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.008
I know I'm new around here,

08:30.043 --> 08:32.177
but can you all explain why

08:32.212 --> 08:33.778
they just can't be in love?

08:33.813 --> 08:34.846
- No, no, no, no, no, nope.

08:34.881 --> 08:35.647
Shh.

08:35.682 --> 08:36.914
- Ah, come on!

08:36.950 --> 08:37.749
- What?

08:37.784 --> 08:38.750
What did I do?

08:38.784 --> 08:39.683
- You can't just
come out and say

08:39.753 --> 08:41.486
the L word in front of Kate.

08:41.522 --> 08:43.922
- I am not against love.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.290
- No, no, no, not at all.

08:45.325 --> 08:46.458
Let's just do a quick count

08:46.493 --> 08:48.126
of how many love
stories you've created.

08:48.161 --> 08:49.327
Oh wait, none.

08:52.666 --> 08:53.565
- Don't listen to them.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.100
First of all, no, I love love.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.935
I just don't think
it's right for me,

08:56.970 --> 08:58.803
for it, for the story.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.806
- You said yourself
this has to be great.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.708
Well, some of the
greatest stories ever told

09:03.744 --> 09:05.677
are love stories.

09:05.712 --> 09:08.947
Without love, the Odyssey
is just like 10 years

09:09.016 --> 09:10.682
of some dude in a
boat getting lost.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.083
- Yeah, Kate.

09:12.119 --> 09:14.920
This story has starlight,
a daring rescue,

09:14.988 --> 09:16.655
it wants to be a romance!

09:16.690 --> 09:17.889
- I hear you, okay?

09:17.925 --> 09:19.925
But the studio is
taking a huge chance

09:19.993 --> 09:21.560
on this short
because they believe

09:21.595 --> 09:23.328
that we're gonna come up
with something original.

09:23.363 --> 09:26.331
Which means subverting
expectations.

09:27.334 --> 09:28.800
- Okay, that's fair.

09:28.835 --> 09:30.368
- Thank you.

09:30.404 --> 09:33.905
- Okay, friend to
friend, I gotta ask,

09:33.974 --> 09:34.839
are you sure you're not letting

09:34.875 --> 09:36.374
your own personal hangups

09:36.443 --> 09:38.176
get in the way of what's
best for this story?

09:38.211 --> 09:39.611
- I don't have any hangups.

09:42.783 --> 09:43.682
Oh.

09:43.717 --> 09:44.983
Liam hold on, one second.

09:45.018 --> 09:46.151
Hi, Liam.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.919
Can I put you on
mute for two seconds?

09:47.955 --> 09:48.920
- Okay.

09:48.956 --> 09:50.155
- I'm just saying,

09:50.190 --> 09:51.823
you turn down romantic
plots at the office.

09:51.858 --> 09:53.191
You turned down
that really cute guy

09:53.260 --> 09:54.459
at the coffee shop that
asked for your number.

09:54.494 --> 09:56.895
- He ordered an extra
shot, extra hot,

09:56.930 --> 09:59.130
extra whipped, sugar
free caramel macchiato,

09:59.166 --> 10:00.999
that is not just
high maintenance,

10:01.068 --> 10:02.300
that is nonsense.

10:02.336 --> 10:03.735
- But you haven't been on a date

10:03.770 --> 10:05.470
since you and Liam got divorced,

10:05.539 --> 10:06.638
five years ago.

10:06.707 --> 10:08.873
- Well, that is because
I have been busy

10:08.909 --> 10:10.375
making beautiful films

10:10.410 --> 10:12.877
and co-parenting
my beautiful child.

10:12.913 --> 10:14.913
- Liam isn't afraid to
put himself out there.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.514
Liam is dating.

10:16.550 --> 10:19.451
Liam is wining and dining.

10:19.519 --> 10:20.285
Liam is--

10:20.354 --> 10:21.753
- Liam is still here.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.355
Not on mute.

10:23.390 --> 10:24.556
But for what it's worth,

10:24.591 --> 10:25.757
I totally agree
with Nadia, Kate.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.325
You need to get back out there.

10:27.361 --> 10:28.193
- Bye.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.496
- I'm just saying.

10:31.531 --> 10:32.998
- You know what, Liam?

10:33.033 --> 10:34.699
I am not taking dating advice

10:34.735 --> 10:36.635
from a man who took
me to a drive-through

10:36.670 --> 10:38.870
fast food place before prom.

10:38.905 --> 10:41.306
- You told me no cliche
romantic gestures.

10:41.341 --> 10:42.540
I stand by it.

10:43.710 --> 10:44.609
- Fair enough.

10:44.645 --> 10:45.543
What's going on?

10:45.612 --> 10:46.711
- So you're getting a dog?

10:46.780 --> 10:50.015
- A full on PowerPoint
presentation.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.217
How did a photographer
and an animator

10:52.285 --> 10:54.586
end up with such
a serious child?

10:54.621 --> 10:56.321
- Oh, well, I come
from a long line

10:56.356 --> 10:57.489
of vagrant artists, Kate.

10:57.524 --> 10:59.024
I blame your family.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.992
She's definitely your
father's mini me.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.260
- Oh, she so is.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.396
Which is why I have
to get her this dog.

11:04.431 --> 11:06.231
She just needs to get outside,

11:06.266 --> 11:08.333
and roll around in the mud,

11:08.402 --> 11:10.135
and make some mistakes.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.569
- Yeah, she needs to be a kid.

11:11.605 --> 11:12.570
- Yes.

11:12.606 --> 11:13.872
Oh, we're adopting the dog

11:13.907 --> 11:14.873
after school today.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.374
Can I change shifts with you?

11:16.410 --> 11:17.876
- Yeah, of course.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.110
Just remember that you
need to pick her up today,

11:19.146 --> 11:20.045
and then drop her
off in the morning

11:20.080 --> 11:21.279
because I'm gonna be--

11:21.314 --> 11:22.280
- In Bali for the
next two weeks.

11:22.315 --> 11:23.081
I'm on it.

11:23.116 --> 11:23.915
- Alright, great.

11:23.950 --> 11:24.749
Thank you.

11:24.785 --> 11:25.950
I owe you.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.285
- Just bring Sophia
back a souvenir.

11:27.354 --> 11:28.520
Something nice.

11:28.555 --> 11:30.355
Not from the airport.

11:30.390 --> 11:31.623
- Okay.

11:31.692 --> 11:32.457
Bye.

11:32.526 --> 11:33.291
- Bye.

11:46.239 --> 11:47.472
- How we doing?

11:47.507 --> 11:49.474
- We've only got one
dog and three cats left.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.643
So I'd say this has been
a phenomenal success.

11:51.678 --> 11:52.477
- That's amazing.

11:52.512 --> 11:53.712
- Yes!

11:53.780 --> 11:56.681
- Dad, can I please go
say hi to my new dog?

11:56.717 --> 11:58.116
- Yeah, pal.

11:58.151 --> 12:01.486
Just stay over there
where I can see you, okay?

12:02.923 --> 12:03.922
- Two.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.156
- Two what?

12:05.192 --> 12:06.324
- Two volunteers
for the carnival.

12:06.359 --> 12:07.158
- What?

12:07.194 --> 12:08.093
How is that possible?

12:08.128 --> 12:09.327
Two in all these parents?

12:09.362 --> 12:10.161
- Please, I have
tried everything.

12:10.197 --> 12:10.995
No takers.

12:11.031 --> 12:12.263
- Hey, hey, hey.

12:12.299 --> 12:13.231
We'll get it sorted.

12:13.266 --> 12:15.600
Two is not a total disaster.

12:16.503 --> 12:17.736
This is a total disaster.

12:17.771 --> 12:19.137
I leave the office
for two minutes,

12:19.172 --> 12:21.339
and then of a sudden
it's they just can't.

12:21.408 --> 12:22.307
Aw man, I'm sorry.

12:22.375 --> 12:23.141
What were you saying?

12:23.210 --> 12:24.442
- Hey.

12:24.478 --> 12:25.643
Remember when you
said you were only

12:25.712 --> 12:28.046
gonna take this job
for a year, tops?

12:28.081 --> 12:30.482
Now here you are,
five years later,

12:30.550 --> 12:33.251
overworked, overcaffeinated

12:33.286 --> 12:34.686
- I'm sorry.

12:34.721 --> 12:35.620
Are you giving me a lecture
about working too hard?

12:35.689 --> 12:37.422
This is coming from a teacher?

12:37.457 --> 12:38.423
Hello pot, kettle.

12:38.458 --> 12:39.357
We meet again.

12:39.392 --> 12:40.291
- Okay, well, it's different

12:40.360 --> 12:42.660
when you love what you do.

12:42.696 --> 12:43.495
Okay?

12:43.530 --> 12:44.329
- I'm sorry.

12:44.364 --> 12:45.163
Who is that?

12:45.198 --> 12:46.498
Why don't I know her?

12:46.533 --> 12:48.333
- Because some parents
manage to wriggle free

12:48.368 --> 12:50.769
from the tentacles of the PTA.

12:51.805 --> 12:53.638
- Oh, not on my watch.

12:56.476 --> 12:57.876
Excuse me!

12:57.911 --> 12:59.043
Hi there, pardon me.

12:59.079 --> 12:59.911
- Hi.
- I don't think we've met.

12:59.980 --> 13:00.879
My name is Eric Smith,

13:00.914 --> 13:02.113
I'm the president of the PTA.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.948
- Oh, I'm Kate Healy.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.950
And this is my daughter, Sophia.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.051
- Oh, hello, Sophia.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.286
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you, I'm Eric.

13:08.321 --> 13:09.120
You excited to
adopt a pet today?

13:09.156 --> 13:10.355
- Yes.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.590
- Well, and clearly
we're not the only ones.

13:12.626 --> 13:13.491
- Look, I don't want to brag,

13:13.527 --> 13:15.093
but that volunteer over there

13:15.128 --> 13:16.327
may or may not have just told me

13:16.363 --> 13:18.696
that this event has been
a phenomenal success.

13:18.765 --> 13:20.665
- More like
fur-nomenal, am I right?

13:24.070 --> 13:26.638
It's just a little dad humor.

13:26.673 --> 13:27.906
Alright.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.307
Dad jokes.

13:29.342 --> 13:30.975
Not for all dads.

13:31.011 --> 13:34.879
Anyway, congrats on the
success of the event,

13:34.915 --> 13:36.881
and please tell
everyone at the PTA

13:36.917 --> 13:39.884
thank you so much
for your hard work.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.353
- I'm actually glad to
hear you feel that way.

13:42.389 --> 13:43.521
We are in desperate need

13:43.557 --> 13:44.689
of some more parent volunteers

13:44.724 --> 13:45.924
for the spring carnival.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.358
- I would love to--

13:47.394 --> 13:48.293
- Great.

13:48.361 --> 13:50.528
- So much, but I am, you know,

13:50.564 --> 13:52.664
a single parent with
a full-time job,

13:52.699 --> 13:54.566
just not a lot of
time for the PTA.

13:54.601 --> 13:55.767
- I understand.

13:55.836 --> 13:58.336
I'm a single parent
with a full-time job.

13:58.371 --> 14:01.306
- Okay, this is the truth.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.541
Every year I go
to that carnival.

14:03.577 --> 14:05.577
- So you understand
how important this is.

14:05.645 --> 14:07.145
- The same carnival.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.880
I believe that bean bag toss

14:08.915 --> 14:10.548
once belonged to the settlers

14:10.584 --> 14:12.217
who crossed the Atlantic Ocean.

14:12.285 --> 14:13.451
- If it ain't
broke, don't fix it.

14:13.486 --> 14:16.721
- If it ain't broke,
you don't need me.

14:18.124 --> 14:19.724
- This is him, Mom.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.594
- Look.

14:22.629 --> 14:25.597
I really appreciate
everything that you do.

14:25.632 --> 14:28.766
And today, I plan
to support the PTA

14:28.802 --> 14:31.469
to the fullest by
adopting that dog

14:31.504 --> 14:33.571
right over there.

14:33.607 --> 14:34.472
- What, that dog?

14:34.507 --> 14:35.907
You can't adopt that dog.

14:35.942 --> 14:37.475
- Why?

14:37.510 --> 14:40.311
- Because we're
adopting that dog.

14:48.255 --> 14:49.487
- Oh.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.923
You must be Sophia's
mom, and Owen's dad.

14:51.958 --> 14:52.857
- Yes.

14:52.893 --> 14:53.925
- This is Bruce.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.360
- Hey, Bruce.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.095
- Owen, sweetie, are you
sure this is the dog?

14:57.130 --> 14:58.363
- Yeah.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.264
His name is Bruce,
like Bruce Wayne.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.099
He's Batdog, Dad.

15:01.167 --> 15:02.500
- You know what, Sophia,

15:02.535 --> 15:03.835
why don't we just
find another dog

15:03.870 --> 15:05.069
who needs a home?

15:05.105 --> 15:06.671
- Because I said in
my presentation--

15:06.706 --> 15:08.506
- Yeah, right, got it.

15:08.541 --> 15:09.574
- You got a presentation?

15:09.609 --> 15:11.242
- She's a go getter.

15:12.512 --> 15:13.311
- Wow.

15:13.346 --> 15:14.212
- Yeah.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.413
- I'm sorry.

15:15.482 --> 15:16.881
Guys, could you give
us five minutes here?

15:16.917 --> 15:17.715
- Yeah.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.150
Let's go, come on.

15:19.185 --> 15:22.053
- Thank you guys.
- Thanks guys, thank you.

15:23.623 --> 15:24.856
- Okay, look.

15:24.891 --> 15:26.357
My family's had a
really hard time.

15:26.393 --> 15:28.226
Owen could definitely
use this friend.

15:28.295 --> 15:31.663
- I hear you, I got a
25 point presentation,

15:31.698 --> 15:34.699
from a 10 year old,
before 8:00 a.m.

15:37.604 --> 15:40.004
I don't want to break
your kid's heart.

15:40.073 --> 15:41.839
- Yeah, me either.

15:41.908 --> 15:42.974
Okay, look.

15:43.009 --> 15:43.975
It's not like there's a shortage

15:44.010 --> 15:45.510
of dogs who need homes.

15:45.578 --> 15:46.978
- That's true.

15:47.013 --> 15:48.913
- Why don't we just agree
to be bigger people,

15:48.949 --> 15:50.448
and find other dogs?

15:50.483 --> 15:51.950
- You promised.

15:51.985 --> 15:53.318
- Please, Mom.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.620
- Wait, wait, wait.

15:55.655 --> 15:56.554
- I promised him.

15:56.589 --> 15:57.388
- No, I know.

15:57.424 --> 15:58.890
- Please don't do this.

15:58.925 --> 16:00.091
I'm sorry.

16:00.126 --> 16:02.694
It's just Bruce,
he's an older dog,

16:02.729 --> 16:03.928
he's not a puppy,

16:03.964 --> 16:06.197
and he's kind of shy
around other dogs,

16:06.232 --> 16:09.500
so he's been pretty
anxious at the shelter.

16:09.536 --> 16:11.402
We've been waiting a long time

16:11.438 --> 16:13.004
for somebody to love Bruce,

16:13.039 --> 16:16.607
and I mean, now there's
two families interested.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.009
- The fact--
- But what do we do here?

16:18.044 --> 16:19.811
You know, do we flip a coin?

16:19.846 --> 16:21.479
That doesn't seem fair.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.815
- We don't have to decide today.

16:23.850 --> 16:25.216
- Okay.

16:25.251 --> 16:26.818
- I'm assuming, since your kids

16:26.853 --> 16:27.986
go to the same school,

16:28.021 --> 16:29.887
that you live in
roughly the same area?

16:29.956 --> 16:30.722
- Rainier Boulevard.

16:30.790 --> 16:31.789
- Dogwood Drive.

16:31.825 --> 16:33.057
- Stop.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.793
- It's not a dad joke,
I actually live there.

16:35.829 --> 16:37.895
But you gotta admit,
it's pure gold.

16:37.964 --> 16:39.430
- Okay, okay.

16:39.466 --> 16:44.168
So you could co-foster
Bruce for a month or so,

16:44.204 --> 16:46.938
meet up a couple times
a week to trade off.

16:46.973 --> 16:49.340
That way we make sure that Bruce

16:49.409 --> 16:51.843
finds the best possible home.

16:52.912 --> 16:54.145
- Mm.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.748
- And it's rare, but this dog

16:56.783 --> 16:59.050
fell in love twice today.

16:59.085 --> 17:02.487
And who are we to get
in the way of that?

17:03.590 --> 17:05.289
- One month.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.223
- Trust me.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.526
You learn a lot in a month.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.365
- Okay.

17:14.401 --> 17:15.867
I could do one month.

17:15.902 --> 17:16.733
- Yeah.

17:21.608 --> 17:22.573
- Yay!

17:37.090 --> 17:40.525
- Sophia, have you
seen my laptop?

17:40.560 --> 17:42.126
Hey.

17:42.162 --> 17:43.294
What's wrong?

17:43.329 --> 17:44.562
- You told me to go outside

17:44.631 --> 17:46.464
and take Bruce to go play.

17:46.499 --> 17:49.600
So I decided to
research dog games.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.102
But everyone on the internet

17:51.137 --> 17:53.671
just seems to disagree
with each other.

17:53.706 --> 17:54.772
- Oh boy.

17:54.808 --> 17:55.673
Okay.

17:55.708 --> 17:57.675
Well, remember the rules?

17:58.778 --> 18:01.179
We never, ever research
on the internet

18:01.247 --> 18:02.647
without Mommy.

18:02.682 --> 18:06.150
And we never, ever, ever
look at the comments.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.151
Okay?

18:07.187 --> 18:08.619
- Okay.

18:08.655 --> 18:11.322
- Second, just look at his face.

18:19.132 --> 18:20.031
You know what?

18:20.066 --> 18:21.632
You just gotta get out there,

18:21.701 --> 18:24.202
and you have to have
fun, and get messy,

18:24.237 --> 18:25.703
and as long as
you're kind to him,

18:25.738 --> 18:27.438
then you'll do great.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.341
You want me to show
you how it's done?

18:30.376 --> 18:31.175
Yeah!

18:32.045 --> 18:32.844
Okay.

18:32.879 --> 18:34.078
Come on, Bruce!

18:34.114 --> 18:35.279
Let's go play.

18:41.354 --> 18:42.220
Okay.

18:42.255 --> 18:43.154
We have all the necessities.

18:43.189 --> 18:44.388
- We've got a detailed schedule,

18:44.424 --> 18:45.823
a copy of the rules
for both houses,

18:45.859 --> 18:48.626
and a very thoroughly
researched obedience plan.

18:48.661 --> 18:52.130
- We've got dog toys,
dog treats, human treats.

18:52.165 --> 18:54.398
- We are organized,
we are prepared.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.602
- We are loving, we
are fun, we are--

18:57.637 --> 18:58.603
- Fun loving?

18:58.638 --> 18:59.837
- Yes!

18:59.873 --> 19:01.539
Doubling down, we
are fun loving.

19:01.608 --> 19:02.507
- We are gonna prove to them

19:02.542 --> 19:03.441
that we're the most responsible

19:03.476 --> 19:04.709
dog owners in the world, buddy.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.043
- And make new friends.

19:06.112 --> 19:06.911
- Oh, okay, wait.

19:06.946 --> 19:08.146
Hey, listen to me.

19:08.181 --> 19:09.647
It is important
to be nice, it is,

19:09.682 --> 19:11.916
but it's kinda like,

19:11.951 --> 19:13.417
what did Captain Hammerhead do

19:13.453 --> 19:14.652
when he had to make a deal
with Professor Platypus?

19:14.687 --> 19:15.586
Quick.

19:15.622 --> 19:16.821
- Power pose and poker face.

19:16.890 --> 19:19.157
- Power pose and
poker face, yes.

19:19.225 --> 19:21.058
- Sharing a dog, pft.

19:21.094 --> 19:22.326
We're expert sharers.

19:22.395 --> 19:23.661
We're gonna win them over

19:23.730 --> 19:25.730
with our charm and kindness.

19:25.765 --> 19:26.531
- And cookies.

19:26.566 --> 19:28.432
- Mostly cookies.

19:28.468 --> 19:29.433
Hi, friends.

19:29.469 --> 19:30.368
- Hey there, how are you?

19:30.403 --> 19:31.435
Hi, Sophia.

19:31.471 --> 19:32.870
- We come bearing gifts.

19:32.906 --> 19:34.138
We have a Bruce.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.441
And his favorite Moo-Cow.

19:38.878 --> 19:39.677
- Moo-Cow?

19:39.712 --> 19:40.678
- A working title.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.246
We can change the name.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.514
Yeah.

19:43.550 --> 19:44.849
And cookies.

19:44.884 --> 19:45.783
- Oh, actually.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.652
Sorry, almost dinner time, yeah?

19:47.687 --> 19:49.987
We'll have maybe one
for dessert, yeah?

19:50.023 --> 19:51.422
- Hey, is that
Captain Hammerhead

19:51.491 --> 19:52.990
from the Awesome Patrol Pals?

19:53.026 --> 19:54.325
- Yeah, I love 'em!

19:54.360 --> 19:57.628
- Did you know that
my mom made him?

19:57.664 --> 19:58.563
- It's true.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.531
I imagined him in my head,

20:00.567 --> 20:02.300
and then I drew him,

20:02.335 --> 20:04.902
and then he came to life.

20:04.971 --> 20:05.703
- Really?

20:05.772 --> 20:06.671
- Yeah.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.005
I'm an animator, so it's my job

20:08.041 --> 20:10.274
to draw really cool things.

20:14.314 --> 20:15.513
- Actually, Sophia, yes.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.515
About the treats reminded me.

20:17.584 --> 20:19.083
I feel like we should
get on the same page

20:19.118 --> 20:21.819
about rules if our dog's gonna
be staying with you guys.

20:21.854 --> 20:23.254
- Your dog?

20:23.289 --> 20:25.656
- Starting with treats
and rewards, right there.

20:25.725 --> 20:26.557
See?

20:27.427 --> 20:28.259
- Oh, wow.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.295
Did you laminate these?

20:31.331 --> 20:32.563
- Yes, I did.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.465
If we're gonna help
Bruce feel secure,

20:34.500 --> 20:35.700
I think it's important
that we give him

20:35.735 --> 20:38.369
a structured,
consistent environment.

20:38.404 --> 20:39.637
- Sure.

20:39.706 --> 20:42.373
We also need to meet
him where he's at.

20:42.408 --> 20:43.207
You know?

20:43.243 --> 20:44.375
Follow his cues.

20:44.410 --> 20:45.610
- Rules and boundaries
will actually

20:45.678 --> 20:47.011
help him feel more secure.

20:47.046 --> 20:50.348
- Or break his
spirit.

20:50.383 --> 20:51.682
- Can we take Bruce to go play?

20:51.718 --> 20:52.783
- Please?

20:52.852 --> 20:53.918
- Yeah, sure, yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:53.953 --> 20:54.752
- Yeah.

20:54.787 --> 20:55.586
Absolutely, here.

20:55.655 --> 20:56.654
Come on, Bruce!

20:56.689 --> 20:57.822
Go have fun, buddy.

20:57.857 --> 20:58.823
Bye, Bruce!

20:59.692 --> 21:00.558
- Just stay where I can see you!

21:00.593 --> 21:01.392
- Stay where I can see you!

21:01.427 --> 21:02.260
- Okay.

21:03.529 --> 21:06.130
- So, I'm guessing
that obedience school

21:06.165 --> 21:07.632
is out of the question?

21:07.667 --> 21:11.035
- If Bruce is going to go
somewhere to be trained,

21:11.070 --> 21:13.571
I would like to approve
that, and attend.

21:13.640 --> 21:14.472
- Okay, sure.

21:14.507 --> 21:15.506
How about this.

21:15.541 --> 21:16.774
You can come with me,

21:16.809 --> 21:18.676
and I will even let
you choose the school.

21:18.711 --> 21:19.510
- Deal.

21:19.545 --> 21:20.711
- Great.

21:20.780 --> 21:21.512
As long as you
agree to volunteer

21:21.547 --> 21:22.847
for the spring carnival.

21:22.882 --> 21:24.582
- Oh, I don't have a sitter.

21:24.617 --> 21:25.816
- PTA provides one.

21:25.852 --> 21:27.251
Fully vetted high
school honors student.

21:27.287 --> 21:28.319
- What about Bruce?

21:28.354 --> 21:29.487
- Oh, dogs are welcome.

21:33.293 --> 21:34.825
- Okay, Eric Smith.

21:37.263 --> 21:39.397
This round is yours.

21:39.432 --> 21:41.232
- Have a good weekend.

21:44.003 --> 21:47.204
See you Monday, 6:00 p.m. sharp.

21:47.240 --> 21:50.074
Hey, Owen, come on
buddy, let's go!

22:00.253 --> 22:01.419
- Good boy.

22:01.487 --> 22:02.219
- You sure you
don't want to watch

22:02.255 --> 22:03.054
something new, pal?

22:03.089 --> 22:04.221
- Dad, it's my favorite!

22:04.290 --> 22:05.189
And plus, Bruce
has never seen it.

22:05.224 --> 22:06.023
- Okay.

22:06.059 --> 22:06.857
Alright, Bruce.

22:06.893 --> 22:07.692
Come here, pal.

22:08.561 --> 22:09.727
- C'mon, Bruce!

22:14.367 --> 22:15.666
- Look at that.

22:15.702 --> 22:16.667
- Kate.

22:16.703 --> 22:17.935
Is that our Kate?

22:17.970 --> 22:20.338
- Yeah, that's our, I mean,

22:20.373 --> 22:22.540
it's Ms. Healy to us, bud.

22:35.922 --> 22:36.721
- Hey.

22:36.756 --> 22:37.988
- Hi!

22:38.057 --> 22:39.457
- Looks like Eric
sent you too, huh?

22:39.492 --> 22:41.292
- Yeah, he did, he did.

22:41.327 --> 22:42.626
Hi, Ms. Ramirez!

22:42.662 --> 22:44.195
Putting the T in PTA, I see.

22:44.230 --> 22:46.197
- Ah, well someone has
to rep the teachers.

22:46.232 --> 22:47.598
It's nice to see you, Ms. Healy.

22:47.633 --> 22:48.432
- Oh, please.

22:48.468 --> 22:49.367
Call me Kate.

22:49.402 --> 22:50.601
By the way, I have to tell you,

22:50.636 --> 22:51.635
Sophia's having the
time of her life

22:51.704 --> 22:53.003
with you in Science Club.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.238
- Oh, good.

22:54.273 --> 22:56.006
Well, if she can keep a secret,

22:56.042 --> 22:57.241
let her know that I'm applying

22:57.276 --> 22:58.409
for a field trip next month

22:58.444 --> 23:00.745
that will blow her mind.

23:00.780 --> 23:02.179
Spoiler alert, it involves

23:02.215 --> 23:03.981
the science center's
galaxy exhibit.

23:04.016 --> 23:05.316
- I call chaperone.

23:05.351 --> 23:06.650
- Are you an astronomy nerd?

23:06.686 --> 23:07.885
- Yes, I am.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.653
Oh, I've been obsessed
with constellations

23:09.689 --> 23:11.055
since I was a kid.

23:11.090 --> 23:13.357
- Did we just
become best friends?

23:13.393 --> 23:15.292
- I think we might have.

23:16.229 --> 23:17.027
- It was nice to see you.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.362
- Yeah, you too.

23:18.398 --> 23:19.296
- I'll do that as well.

23:19.332 --> 23:20.531
Okay, last order of business,

23:20.566 --> 23:22.032
I know you all have
jobs to get back to.

23:22.068 --> 23:24.001
Committee heads for
the spring carnival.

23:24.036 --> 23:26.504
Susan, you'll do the
cake walk again as usual.

23:26.539 --> 23:27.438
Okay.

23:27.473 --> 23:28.339
Allison, you'll be in charge

23:28.374 --> 23:29.673
of the games again as usual,

23:29.709 --> 23:33.511
I'll be in charge of the
tickets again as usual.

23:34.414 --> 23:36.313
And our newest member, Kate,

23:36.349 --> 23:38.015
will be in charge of
the silent auction.

23:38.084 --> 23:40.651
Everyone, give Kate
a big, warm welcome.

23:43.089 --> 23:44.288
- Thank you.

23:44.323 --> 23:45.456
- Alright, I want
us all to break off

23:45.491 --> 23:46.824
into groups in a moment--

23:46.893 --> 23:48.325
- Oh.

23:48.394 --> 23:49.059
- And I want you all to
really think about what...

23:49.095 --> 23:49.960
Yeah.

23:49.996 --> 23:51.562
- Hi, yes.

23:51.597 --> 23:52.463
What, um...

23:54.634 --> 23:56.100
What do I do?

23:56.135 --> 23:57.368
- You're in charge of
the silent auction.

23:57.403 --> 23:59.370
- Oh, like the auctioneer?

23:59.405 --> 24:01.605
Hey, can I get a one dolla,
one dolla, going once!

24:01.641 --> 24:02.840
- No, it's a silent auction.

24:02.875 --> 24:06.010
- So you want me to
just do it silently.

24:06.045 --> 24:07.344
- Are you...

24:07.380 --> 24:10.181
No, your job is to get
businesses to donate

24:10.216 --> 24:11.916
items for prizes
for the auction,

24:11.984 --> 24:13.484
then you're gonna
monitor the auction,

24:13.519 --> 24:14.385
and then you'll be in charge

24:14.420 --> 24:15.219
of announcing the winners.

24:15.254 --> 24:17.054
That's it, very easy.

24:17.089 --> 24:18.823
Okay, I want us all to
break off into groups,

24:18.858 --> 24:20.925
and I want to really
think about...

24:20.993 --> 24:21.725
Yeah, Kate?

24:21.794 --> 24:23.694
- What is the theme?

24:23.729 --> 24:25.196
For the carnival.

24:25.231 --> 24:27.231
- No, there's
never been a theme,

24:27.300 --> 24:28.632
it's just spring carnival.

24:28.668 --> 24:31.669
- I mean, that's your
problem right there.

24:31.704 --> 24:32.937
You gotta have a theme.

24:32.972 --> 24:35.840
- Well, what do
you have in mind?

24:35.875 --> 24:38.442
- Well, I mean, let's think
about it for a second.

24:38.478 --> 24:40.778
It should be something that

24:40.813 --> 24:43.514
sparks kids'
imaginations, right?

24:44.784 --> 24:47.785
Kids love pirates,
we could do space!

24:49.355 --> 24:50.254
Could you imagine how cool--

24:50.289 --> 24:50.988
- The thing is atually, the--

24:51.023 --> 24:51.956
- It would be?

24:51.991 --> 24:53.457
For them to walk
in and be like--

24:53.493 --> 24:54.391
- We don't have the budget to
revamp the entire carnival.

24:54.427 --> 24:55.392
- Well, I mean, I'm not opposed

24:55.428 --> 24:57.294
to hearing some fresh ideas.

24:57.330 --> 24:58.429
All in favor?

25:01.467 --> 25:02.533
- Okay.

25:02.568 --> 25:03.767
Okay.

25:03.803 --> 25:05.269
Sure.

25:05.304 --> 25:08.472
At our next meeting, we'll
discuss potential themes.

25:08.541 --> 25:10.140
Great, wonderful.

25:10.209 --> 25:12.176
Any other thoughts, from anyone?

25:12.211 --> 25:13.410
Yes, Kate?

25:13.446 --> 25:15.446
- We need to talk
about funnel cake.

25:16.349 --> 25:17.281
- Okay.
- Right?

25:17.350 --> 25:18.082
- Meeting is adjourned!
- Okay.

25:18.117 --> 25:19.717
- Folks, thank you.

25:27.093 --> 25:28.492
- You said if I join the PTA,

25:28.528 --> 25:31.529
I could choose the
obedience school.

25:31.564 --> 25:33.030
You brought this on yourself.

25:33.065 --> 25:34.465
- Join, follow.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.233
Not stage a coup in
the school library.

25:38.404 --> 25:40.304
- Oh, come on.

25:40.339 --> 25:43.941
Even Carla said the PTA
could use a bit more energy.

25:43.976 --> 25:45.109
A little fun.

25:45.144 --> 25:46.777
- Carla's my friend.

25:47.813 --> 25:48.979
She said that?

25:51.450 --> 25:54.351
- You gotta admit, you
run that organization

25:54.420 --> 25:57.087
like a well oiled machine.

25:57.123 --> 26:00.658
You are a charismatic
and efficient leader.

26:01.994 --> 26:02.793
- Thank you.

26:02.828 --> 26:03.627
- But--

26:03.663 --> 26:04.828
- There it is.

26:07.934 --> 26:09.800
What are you doing?

26:09.835 --> 26:11.302
- Nope.

26:11.370 --> 26:13.771
Unfortunately, I
detect no signs of it.

26:13.806 --> 26:15.272
- No signs of what?

26:15.308 --> 26:16.607
- Fun.

26:16.642 --> 26:18.943
Not a trace of fun.

26:20.112 --> 26:20.945
Oh.

26:22.014 --> 26:23.180
- I'm fun.

26:23.215 --> 26:24.348
I have lots of fun.

26:24.383 --> 26:25.616
- Okay, alright.

26:25.685 --> 26:28.452
So what's like, an
adventure for you?

26:28.521 --> 26:29.453
- An adventure for me?

26:29.522 --> 26:30.254
- Yeah.

26:30.323 --> 26:32.389
- Um, okay, let's see.

26:32.425 --> 26:34.224
Hiking, hiking.

26:34.260 --> 26:35.059
Yeah.

26:35.094 --> 26:36.560
- Okay.

26:36.596 --> 26:37.061
- I'm taking Owen and
Bruce hiking this weekend.

26:37.096 --> 26:37.828
- Yeah?

26:37.863 --> 26:39.396
- Mhm.

26:39.432 --> 26:40.297
Yeah, we're gonna go hiking
down the Burke-Gilman Trail,

26:40.333 --> 26:41.532
right 'til we get to the docks,

26:41.567 --> 26:42.366
I'm gonna lay eyes on
this traffic hot spot

26:42.401 --> 26:43.734
and just see if--

26:44.904 --> 26:45.970
- Hey, Eric, what is it you said

26:46.005 --> 26:47.871
you did for a living?

26:47.907 --> 26:49.940
- I work for the Department
of Transportation.

26:49.976 --> 26:52.109
- I knew it, I knew it!
- But, but--

26:52.144 --> 26:53.043
- No!

26:53.112 --> 26:54.278
That's work!

26:54.313 --> 26:55.613
- I do still--
- That's not fun!

26:55.648 --> 26:57.648
I award you zero points.

27:00.019 --> 27:02.820
- You should come with us.

27:02.855 --> 27:03.754
- What?

27:03.789 --> 27:05.322
- Consider it an olive branch.

27:05.358 --> 27:09.426
You'd be rescuing Owen
from his lame, boring dad.

27:10.596 --> 27:13.764
Give Sophia a little
more time with Bruce.

27:14.734 --> 27:15.899
Look at them.

27:15.935 --> 27:16.834
- Good boy!

27:23.242 --> 27:24.074
- Okay.

27:27.413 --> 27:28.712
We'll come.

27:28.748 --> 27:29.546
- Good.

27:33.719 --> 27:35.753
- Beautiful.

27:35.788 --> 27:38.222
- Look at that magnolia tree.

27:39.425 --> 27:40.257
Yeah.

27:42.194 --> 27:43.394
- Yeah.

27:43.429 --> 27:44.161
- Does he make
you go on nature walks

27:44.196 --> 27:45.229
all the time?

27:45.264 --> 27:45.996
- Yeah.

27:46.032 --> 27:47.665
- Oh, I see a bench.

27:47.700 --> 27:48.499
- Oh.

27:48.534 --> 27:49.299
- There you go, bud.

27:49.335 --> 27:50.134
- Yeah.

27:51.804 --> 27:55.072
Oh, hey, show me one of
your superhero moves!

27:55.141 --> 27:56.807
Let me see!

27:56.842 --> 27:59.009
Yeah, that's a good one!

27:59.045 --> 28:01.178
Want to play superhero
red light, green light?

28:01.213 --> 28:04.448
- So I hear you've been
teaching Bruce some tricks.

28:04.483 --> 28:05.683
- Of course.

28:05.718 --> 28:07.217
That's rule seven.

28:08.954 --> 28:10.320
I like your Bruce rules.

28:10.356 --> 28:13.357
They help me make sure
I know what I'm doing.

28:13.426 --> 28:14.491
- Yeah.

28:14.527 --> 28:15.359
Me too.

28:17.430 --> 28:18.796
- Can I tell you a secret?

28:18.831 --> 28:19.997
- Sure.

28:20.066 --> 28:21.398
- I like that you
laminated them.

28:21.434 --> 28:22.900
People are messy.

28:24.503 --> 28:25.803
- Yeah.

28:25.838 --> 28:27.071
Yeah, they are.

28:28.374 --> 28:29.373
- Red light!

28:31.977 --> 28:33.277
Wait a second!

28:33.312 --> 28:35.045
Where was the green light?

28:35.081 --> 28:36.647
- Wait.

28:36.716 --> 28:40.584
Aren't you supposed to
wait for the green light?

28:40.619 --> 28:42.252
How's anyone supposed to win?

28:42.288 --> 28:43.687
- Oh, no.

28:43.723 --> 28:47.524
Owen's much more concerned
with fun than winning.

28:47.560 --> 28:48.659
- My mom too.

28:58.337 --> 28:59.503
- Green light!

29:01.173 --> 29:02.840
Look at those moves!

29:12.651 --> 29:13.484
Mm.
- Mm.

29:16.388 --> 29:18.555
- Penny for your thoughts?

29:20.960 --> 29:22.960
- For 20 years, we've
been trying to find

29:23.028 --> 29:25.763
a safe way to close
the gap on this trail.

29:25.798 --> 29:26.897
And we finally found something

29:26.932 --> 29:28.398
that was gonna
work for everyone,

29:28.434 --> 29:30.400
and then that marina
that we hiked past,

29:30.436 --> 29:31.935
they're now suing.

29:33.205 --> 29:34.338
After we found the solution

29:34.373 --> 29:35.272
that was gonna
work for everyone,

29:35.341 --> 29:36.206
they're suing because they don't

29:36.242 --> 29:38.575
want to lose parking spots.

29:38.644 --> 29:40.878
- Hm, that's annoying.

29:40.913 --> 29:41.712
- Yeah.

29:41.747 --> 29:42.880
Tell me about it.

29:42.915 --> 29:44.047
Anyway, people keep telling me

29:44.083 --> 29:45.215
it's alright, be patient,

29:45.251 --> 29:47.050
we're gonna figure
it out, we'll get it.

29:47.119 --> 29:50.454
But people are getting
hurt in the meantime.

29:50.489 --> 29:52.356
It's just making me crazy.

29:52.391 --> 29:53.857
- Mm.

29:53.893 --> 29:54.725
Yeah.

29:55.828 --> 29:58.362
I get called crazy
a lot at work.

29:59.532 --> 30:02.866
I like to think of it
as being passionate.

30:05.304 --> 30:08.071
- I'm not sure I'm
passionate about my job.

30:08.107 --> 30:10.741
I mean, it's not really
where I saw myself ending up.

30:10.776 --> 30:14.845
- Well, what did you want
to be when you grew up?

30:14.914 --> 30:18.415
- What adult has their
childhood dream job?

30:20.486 --> 30:21.318
- I do.

30:25.391 --> 30:27.090
- Alright, well, we
can't all be that lucky.

30:29.962 --> 30:30.928
- See, I don't think luck

30:30.963 --> 30:32.596
has anything to do with it.

30:32.631 --> 30:33.764
If you know what
your North Star is,

30:33.799 --> 30:36.066
you can chart a course.

30:36.101 --> 30:37.568
- That was beautiful nonsense.

30:39.939 --> 30:42.005
- No, seriously.

30:42.041 --> 30:43.507
If you know what you want most,

30:43.542 --> 30:46.743
then you can figure
out a way to get it.

30:47.913 --> 30:49.413
- I have a lot of
responsibility,

30:49.481 --> 30:51.648
I'm a single dad.

30:51.684 --> 30:53.050
- What is it that you said to me

30:53.085 --> 30:54.885
when I said I
couldn't do the PTA?

30:54.920 --> 30:55.719
Oh, right.

30:57.623 --> 31:00.190
I'm a single parent too,
with a full-time job.

31:00.226 --> 31:01.358
- I was empathizing.

31:02.795 --> 31:04.027
- You were calling me out,

31:04.063 --> 31:06.663
and doing a remedial
job of back peddling.

31:09.802 --> 31:10.934
So.

31:10.970 --> 31:12.970
This is me, empathizing.

31:16.008 --> 31:19.977
I'm a single parent too,
with a full-time job,

31:20.012 --> 31:21.812
which I love.

31:21.847 --> 31:23.280
What do you love?

31:29.822 --> 31:32.990
- Affordable housing advocacy.

31:33.058 --> 31:35.859
I know it sounds boring,
but that's my dream job.

31:35.895 --> 31:37.194
- Why?

31:37.229 --> 31:38.695
- I had an internship
when I was in college,

31:38.731 --> 31:41.598
and we got to really fight
against these developers

31:41.634 --> 31:44.835
to help protect lower
income housing and

31:46.372 --> 31:49.006
I like going to bat for people.

31:49.942 --> 31:51.575
- So this superhero thing

31:51.610 --> 31:54.244
kind of runs in the family, huh?

31:55.080 --> 31:56.680
- Yeah, I guess so.

31:57.650 --> 31:59.983
- Nothing boring about that.

32:08.394 --> 32:09.626
- Got it, yeah.

32:09.662 --> 32:10.460
And then we can--

32:10.496 --> 32:11.361
- Happy Monday!

32:11.397 --> 32:12.529
- You've got to stop doing that!

32:13.465 --> 32:14.197
- Never gets old!

32:15.534 --> 32:17.768
Look, consider this a
small thank you gift.

32:17.803 --> 32:19.436
- Aw.
- Aw, you're the best.

32:19.471 --> 32:21.338
- And a small I'm sorry gift.

32:21.373 --> 32:22.839
I drafted storyboards
for three new

32:22.875 --> 32:24.641
possible endings last night,

32:24.677 --> 32:26.810
so conference room please.

32:26.845 --> 32:28.078
- You're the worst.

32:28.113 --> 32:29.012
- Thank you so
much, you're the best.

32:29.081 --> 32:29.846
- The worst.

32:29.915 --> 32:30.681
- I love ya.

32:30.749 --> 32:31.515
I do, I do.

32:31.583 --> 32:33.083
Thank you so much.

32:33.986 --> 32:35.786
- I see you survived your hike.

32:35.821 --> 32:38.455
Four hours with Mr. PTA
power trip, how was it?

32:38.490 --> 32:40.123
- It actually wasn't that bad.

32:40.159 --> 32:42.326
He was a lot more
relaxed than I expected.

32:42.394 --> 32:43.593
- You mean to tell me,

32:43.629 --> 32:45.862
the guy who laminated
the dog rules was fun?

32:47.232 --> 32:49.366
On a hike, uphill, with
the bugs and everything?

32:49.401 --> 32:51.969
- Well, not so much
the hiking part,

32:52.037 --> 32:54.671
but when we got ice
cream, it was civil,

32:54.707 --> 32:56.239
dare I say, pleasant?

32:56.275 --> 32:58.742
- Well, everyone's pleasant
when they've had ice cream, so.

32:58.777 --> 33:00.344
- Yeah.

33:00.379 --> 33:01.578
Yeah, you're probably right.

33:01.613 --> 33:05.082
It's probably just a
sprinkle induced glitch.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.088
- Alright, without further ado,

33:11.156 --> 33:13.390
may we present, CandyLand!

33:13.459 --> 33:14.558
Only full sized.

33:14.626 --> 33:15.525
- Okay.

33:15.561 --> 33:16.960
Check this out.

33:16.996 --> 33:18.195
We can take the tent poles,

33:18.230 --> 33:21.298
and we can turn them
into candy canes.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.100
- Pardon me for
jumping in here, Kate.

33:23.135 --> 33:26.703
This budget seems quite a
bit out of our means though.

33:26.772 --> 33:29.006
- The paint shop
could donate paint.

33:29.041 --> 33:31.842
- This is a very hefty time
commitment for all of us.

33:31.877 --> 33:34.244
And we're not exactly
a bunch of Van Gogh's.

33:34.279 --> 33:35.412
- Well, you know what?

33:35.447 --> 33:37.147
If Eric can keep
everyone on budget,

33:37.182 --> 33:40.350
then I'll teach
everyone how to paint.

33:41.754 --> 33:42.953
- Okay.

33:42.988 --> 33:44.388
Let's just put it to a vote.

33:44.423 --> 33:45.989
All those in favor.

33:52.264 --> 33:53.296
For someone who wanted nothing

33:53.365 --> 33:54.531
to do with the PTA,

33:54.566 --> 33:56.533
you sure made a lot
of work for yourself.

33:56.568 --> 33:58.935
- Consider it an olive branch.

33:58.971 --> 34:01.772
Besides, I am
choosing my battles.

34:01.807 --> 34:02.572
- Yeah?

34:02.608 --> 34:03.507
- Yeah.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.409
Speaking of our PTA agreement,

34:05.444 --> 34:07.744
I feel I should
warn you, my friend,

34:07.780 --> 34:11.915
that you are in for an
intense evening tomorrow.

34:11.949 --> 34:13.150
- How do you mean?

34:13.185 --> 34:15.152
- Well, I finally found
an obedience school.

34:15.187 --> 34:16.719
Great place, solid reviews,

34:16.755 --> 34:19.255
it's called Fuzzy Friends Time.

34:19.324 --> 34:20.389
- Fuzzy Friends
Time, isn't that--

34:20.426 --> 34:21.257
- 7:00.

34:22.161 --> 34:22.993
Sharp.

34:24.063 --> 34:25.062
- I don't have a sitter.

34:25.130 --> 34:25.896
- Oh, you know what?

34:25.964 --> 34:27.130
I found us one.

34:27.166 --> 34:30.567
A fully vetted high
school honors student.

34:32.871 --> 34:33.670
- Bye, Eric.

34:33.705 --> 34:35.304
- See you tomorrow.

34:43.282 --> 34:44.347
- And breathe.

34:46.952 --> 34:47.851
And exhale.

34:50.856 --> 34:51.822
And breathe.

34:54.326 --> 34:55.125
Exhale.

34:56.661 --> 34:57.661
Now once you've finished

34:57.729 --> 34:58.895
your breathing exercises,

34:58.931 --> 35:01.698
and you feel calm and centered,

35:01.733 --> 35:03.633
invite your pet to sit.

35:06.572 --> 35:07.437
- Bruce.

35:07.473 --> 35:08.405
Please sit.

35:11.143 --> 35:12.242
- Come on.

35:12.277 --> 35:14.111
He obviously already
knew that word.

35:14.179 --> 35:15.612
- Okay.

35:15.681 --> 35:17.681
Bruce, please speak.

35:18.884 --> 35:20.517
There you go, good job.

35:20.552 --> 35:21.485
- Right, okay.

35:21.520 --> 35:22.319
Sit.

35:22.354 --> 35:23.153
Bruce, sit.

35:23.188 --> 35:24.221
Bruce, sit.

35:24.256 --> 35:25.155
Sit, sit, sit.

35:25.190 --> 35:25.989
Sit, sit, sit, bud.

35:26.024 --> 35:27.157
Come on, sit, sit, sit.

35:27.192 --> 35:28.058
- Breathe.
- Sit, that's it.

35:28.093 --> 35:28.892
Come on, sit, sit.

35:28.927 --> 35:29.726
- Breathe.

35:29.761 --> 35:31.194
- I know, I got this.

35:31.230 --> 35:31.895
- How did you do, just--
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

35:31.964 --> 35:33.530
Breathe.

35:35.567 --> 35:36.867
There you go.

35:36.902 --> 35:37.901
It's okay.

35:37.970 --> 35:38.802
Try again.

35:39.905 --> 35:41.538
- Bruce, please sit.

35:42.474 --> 35:43.507
- Good boy!
- Good boy!

35:43.542 --> 35:44.508
- Good boy!

35:45.377 --> 35:46.176
- Good boy!

35:46.211 --> 35:47.110
He did it!

35:47.146 --> 35:49.012
- That's great, but calm.

35:49.047 --> 35:49.846
- Okay.

35:49.882 --> 35:51.448
Good boy, good boy.

35:54.019 --> 35:54.918
See?

35:54.953 --> 35:56.653
- Okay, wow, I'm a convert.

35:56.688 --> 35:57.988
Do you make house calls?

35:58.023 --> 35:59.523
- I am available
for all of your home

35:59.591 --> 36:00.790
and office needs.

36:00.826 --> 36:01.725
- Perfect.

36:01.760 --> 36:02.893
Crazy boss?

36:02.928 --> 36:04.494
- Breathe.

36:04.563 --> 36:06.129
- Missed deadline?

36:06.165 --> 36:07.230
- Breathe.

36:07.266 --> 36:08.398
- Mm, yep.
- Yeah.

36:08.433 --> 36:09.399
- That's a tough one.

36:12.304 --> 36:13.703
My son makes our
living room wall

36:13.739 --> 36:15.705
into his own personal
spaghetti art installation.

36:15.741 --> 36:18.041
- Mm, yeah, see
now, that I support.

36:18.076 --> 36:19.476
- No, are you kidding me?

36:19.545 --> 36:20.610
That's just destruction.

36:20.646 --> 36:21.912
- Come on, you
really have to just

36:21.947 --> 36:23.079
have more fun in your--

36:23.115 --> 36:24.681
- No, that's not
being mindful at all.

36:24.716 --> 36:25.515
- No, no, no, just--

36:25.551 --> 36:26.349
- Hi.
- Yeah.

36:26.385 --> 36:27.184
- Hi.

36:27.219 --> 36:28.418
- Hey.

36:28.453 --> 36:29.786
- Um, our fuzzy
friends can sense

36:29.855 --> 36:30.820
when they're not receiving

36:30.856 --> 36:32.556
our full, energetic attention.

36:32.591 --> 36:34.057
- Oh, yeah.

36:34.092 --> 36:37.661
- So if we can just save the
flirting for after class?

36:37.696 --> 36:39.162
- The...

36:39.198 --> 36:40.530
- Flirting?

36:40.566 --> 36:41.631
No.

36:41.667 --> 36:42.732
No, no, no.

36:42.801 --> 36:43.733
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

36:44.636 --> 36:45.902
No, no, no, no.

36:47.139 --> 36:49.139
- Wow, that was 11 no's.

36:50.008 --> 36:50.774
- No?

36:50.809 --> 36:52.375
- No, mhm.

36:52.444 --> 36:53.210
- 12.

36:53.278 --> 36:54.678
- Oh, sorry.

36:54.713 --> 36:55.946
Since you're training
the same dog, I assumed--

36:55.981 --> 36:57.280
- No, no, no.

36:57.316 --> 36:58.114
We share the dog.

36:58.150 --> 36:58.949
- It's shared.

36:58.984 --> 36:59.783
- Yes.

36:59.818 --> 37:01.318
But we're not together.

37:01.353 --> 37:04.154
- I have a girlfriend,
and she has a--

37:04.189 --> 37:05.355
- A job.
- Job.

37:06.291 --> 37:08.325
A great job, a great job.

37:08.360 --> 37:09.492
And a daughter.
- She has a very good job.

37:09.528 --> 37:10.794
- Yeah, and a daughter.

37:10.829 --> 37:12.896
Which is why I
don't really date.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.397
I mean, not that
there's anything wrong

37:14.433 --> 37:15.799
with dating as a parent.

37:15.834 --> 37:17.334
So, we just share the dog,

37:17.402 --> 37:18.802
and he has a--

37:18.837 --> 37:20.870
- Yeah, I have Bianca.

37:20.906 --> 37:21.938
- Bianca!

37:21.974 --> 37:24.274
He's got Bianca!

37:24.309 --> 37:26.977
So we're definitely,
you know, not flirting.

37:27.045 --> 37:29.212
And this has just
become embarrassing

37:29.248 --> 37:30.447
for all of us,

37:30.515 --> 37:33.850
so I'm just gonna stop
disrupting the class,

37:33.885 --> 37:35.352
you know, with
all the breathing,

37:35.387 --> 37:36.620
and the calm bodies,

37:36.688 --> 37:38.421
with all of the not flirting.

37:38.457 --> 37:39.289
So, I...

37:42.361 --> 37:43.159
Can...

37:48.000 --> 37:49.566
- That was awkward.

37:53.905 --> 37:56.573
- Uh, she said I'd appreciate it

37:58.210 --> 38:02.078
if you'd save the
flirting for after class.

38:02.114 --> 38:02.946
Yeah.

38:04.283 --> 38:06.850
- Have more coffee,
it fixes everything.

38:06.885 --> 38:07.717
- Mm.

38:08.920 --> 38:11.488
- Okay, I've seen some
epic Kate speeches,

38:11.523 --> 38:14.157
but this, may
officially elect you

38:14.192 --> 38:15.425
Mayor of Awkwardville.

38:15.494 --> 38:17.494
- Look, I haven't been
accused of flirting

38:17.529 --> 38:19.329
in 10 years, at least.

38:22.234 --> 38:23.199
- Eh.

38:23.235 --> 38:24.534
- What?

38:24.569 --> 38:25.702
- Were you?

38:25.737 --> 38:26.536
- What?

38:26.571 --> 38:27.404
- Flirting!

38:27.472 --> 38:28.538
- What?

38:28.607 --> 38:29.773
No!

38:29.808 --> 38:31.374
- He said he's a single parent!

38:31.443 --> 38:34.344
- Who has a
girlfriend, and look,

38:34.379 --> 38:35.845
I'm not dating anyone

38:35.881 --> 38:38.315
while Sophia's
still in the house.

38:38.350 --> 38:39.749
Liam and I have a great system

38:39.785 --> 38:41.751
that ensures Sophia doesn't
miss out on anything.

38:41.787 --> 38:44.487
I am not willing to gamble that.

38:44.523 --> 38:45.855
- If you say so.

38:47.726 --> 38:48.558
- What?

38:49.428 --> 38:50.927
- I'm just saying.

38:52.097 --> 38:55.131
I'm glad Sophia's not
missing out on anything,

38:55.167 --> 38:56.599
but you might be.

39:01.406 --> 39:02.806
- And shake, nice to meet you.

39:02.874 --> 39:05.542
It's very nice to meet
you, you're such a friend.

39:05.577 --> 39:06.776
Isn't it amazing?

39:06.812 --> 39:07.577
Here, do you want
to give him one?

39:07.612 --> 39:08.678
- Hey.

39:08.714 --> 39:10.413
- My instructions a bit much?

39:10.449 --> 39:11.281
- A little bit.

39:13.385 --> 39:14.417
- Oh, pardon me, sorry.

39:14.453 --> 39:15.251
Kate!

39:15.287 --> 39:16.086
- Yeah.

39:16.121 --> 39:17.220
- Hey.

39:17.255 --> 39:18.421
- Hey.

39:18.490 --> 39:19.155
- You forgot to
leave Mr. Moo-Cow.

39:19.191 --> 39:20.090
- Oh.

39:20.158 --> 39:21.324
- I'm gonna have to stop by

39:21.360 --> 39:22.492
your office at lunch
tomorrow and grab him.

39:22.527 --> 39:23.326
Is that okay?

39:23.362 --> 39:24.594
- Okay, yeah, yep.

39:24.663 --> 39:25.495
- Alright.

39:29.801 --> 39:30.700
- Okay.

39:30.736 --> 39:33.303
What's that face for?

39:33.338 --> 39:34.838
- Nothing, it's...

39:36.641 --> 39:39.709
It's just, so when
he's with other people,

39:39.778 --> 39:43.613
he just has this whole
Prince Charming routine--

39:43.648 --> 39:44.447
- Oh.

39:44.483 --> 39:45.682
Would we call it that?

39:45.717 --> 39:48.752
- And then with me he's
like, ugh, you know?

39:48.787 --> 39:49.686
- Okay.

39:49.755 --> 39:50.587
You can't compare yourself

39:50.622 --> 39:52.255
to those PTA parents.

39:52.290 --> 39:53.423
They've known him a long time,

39:53.458 --> 39:55.825
they're like family.

39:55.861 --> 39:58.395
When Amy passed away, they
all rallied around him.

39:58.430 --> 40:00.230
They brought him casseroles,
and baby sitters--

40:00.265 --> 40:01.631
- Amy?

40:01.666 --> 40:02.599
- His wife.

40:03.602 --> 40:05.301
And my best friend.

40:05.337 --> 40:07.303
We taught here together.

40:08.974 --> 40:09.806
- Oh.

40:12.711 --> 40:14.210
I am so sorry.

40:14.246 --> 40:15.378
- Thanks.

40:15.414 --> 40:16.212
Me too.

40:17.382 --> 40:18.581
She was just one of those people

40:18.617 --> 40:20.417
who made you feel
loved, you know?

40:20.452 --> 40:21.418
- Yeah.

40:21.453 --> 40:22.786
- She was grounded and steady,

40:22.854 --> 40:25.722
but there was this
light about her.

40:27.526 --> 40:29.492
You push him outside
of his comfort zone,

40:29.528 --> 40:31.161
like Amy did.

40:31.196 --> 40:33.496
It's good for him.

40:33.532 --> 40:35.698
He needs a friend like you.

40:39.404 --> 40:40.236
Okay.

40:52.617 --> 40:53.383
- Good morning!

40:53.452 --> 40:55.051
- Oh, don't do that!

40:55.120 --> 40:55.852
- Ha!

40:55.921 --> 40:56.686
Not so fun, is it?

40:56.755 --> 40:57.587
- Hey!

40:58.523 --> 41:00.757
- I'm sorry, did I scare you?

41:00.792 --> 41:01.624
- No.

41:02.861 --> 41:03.760
Hi.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.161
Oh, Moo-Cow.

41:05.197 --> 41:07.297
Yes, I totally forgot
you were coming by.

41:07.332 --> 41:08.731
Hold on, so sorry.

41:08.767 --> 41:09.966
- It's okay.

41:10.001 --> 41:12.569
We need to work on
that name by the way.

41:12.604 --> 41:14.504
This office is awesome.

41:16.975 --> 41:17.874
- Oh.

41:17.909 --> 41:19.042
- The ping pong out there.

41:19.077 --> 41:19.976
- Yeah.

41:20.045 --> 41:21.778
- They just play ping pong.

41:21.813 --> 41:23.046
- Um, hold on.

41:23.081 --> 41:25.615
I was on the phone with you,

41:25.684 --> 41:28.117
and then I picked up Moo-Cow,

41:29.054 --> 41:30.954
and I picked up my keys,

41:31.022 --> 41:33.223
and then I dropped my keys.

41:35.527 --> 41:38.828
I just totally left
him by the front door.

41:38.864 --> 41:40.330
I'm so sorry.

41:40.365 --> 41:41.764
- It's okay, it's fine.

41:41.833 --> 41:42.999
Do you want to drop
him off at my work

41:43.034 --> 41:44.234
when you pick Sophia
up from school?

41:44.269 --> 41:45.134
I'm right by there.

41:45.170 --> 41:46.302
- Yeah, that would be great.

41:46.338 --> 41:47.203
I will do that.

41:47.239 --> 41:49.672
Here, write your address down.

41:50.575 --> 41:51.808
- Oh.

41:51.843 --> 41:53.042
Wow.

41:53.078 --> 41:53.710
- Oh, no, no, no,
it's not finished,

41:53.745 --> 41:54.410
it's not.

41:54.479 --> 41:55.945
Oh.

41:55.981 --> 41:57.847
- Can I just take a peek?
- You're just coming over.

41:57.883 --> 41:59.148
- It's amazing.

42:00.218 --> 42:02.385
- Well, it will be amazing

42:04.055 --> 42:06.589
once I come up with a
heart stopping ending,

42:06.625 --> 42:08.858
which I decidedly have not.

42:10.262 --> 42:13.162
- Oh, is it a comedy or tragedy?

42:13.198 --> 42:14.631
- Why do you ask?

42:14.666 --> 42:16.332
- Well, if it's a comedy,
they end up together,

42:16.401 --> 42:17.901
and if it's a tragedy,

42:17.936 --> 42:20.470
they're driven apart by the
forces of fate or something.

42:20.505 --> 42:22.071
Those are the rules, right?

42:22.107 --> 42:25.942
- You
love your rules.

42:25.977 --> 42:29.112
Well, it's actually
not that simple.

42:29.147 --> 42:31.814
Those are the rules for romance,

42:33.251 --> 42:34.951
and this is not that.

42:36.621 --> 42:39.289
This is a story about courage,

42:39.357 --> 42:41.958
and self discovery, and--

42:42.027 --> 42:42.859
- Love.

42:42.894 --> 42:44.327
- No!

42:44.362 --> 42:46.729
Why does everybody
keep saying that?

42:46.765 --> 42:47.997
- Well, because they're
obviously in love,

42:48.033 --> 42:50.199
look at how you drew them.

42:56.808 --> 42:57.974
- They're not in love.

42:58.009 --> 42:58.808
I mean--

42:58.843 --> 43:01.244
- Okay, if you say so.

43:01.313 --> 43:02.645
I will leave you to it,

43:02.681 --> 43:06.215
and then I will see
you today at three ish.

43:09.220 --> 43:10.119
Sorry, yep.

43:16.261 --> 43:17.093
- Hi.

43:17.128 --> 43:18.995
- Bianca wants to talk.

43:19.030 --> 43:19.929
- Uh oh.

43:19.965 --> 43:20.830
- No, before she left,

43:20.865 --> 43:22.031
we said we wanted to talk about

43:22.100 --> 43:23.333
the next steps
when she got back.

43:23.368 --> 43:25.468
So I think it's positive, right?

43:25.503 --> 43:26.669
- Well, that depends.

43:26.738 --> 43:29.405
What do you want
the next step to be?

43:29.441 --> 43:30.907
- I mean, there's lots
to consider practically,

43:30.942 --> 43:32.642
but Bianca's great.

43:32.677 --> 43:33.876
Right?

43:33.912 --> 43:36.946
- Well, are you
asking me, or you?

43:36.982 --> 43:38.114
- Both?

43:38.149 --> 43:39.115
- Well, whether or not I think

43:39.150 --> 43:40.783
she's the one doesn't matter.

43:40.819 --> 43:44.020
The only opinion that
matters is yours.

43:47.959 --> 43:49.592
- We have to send all of
these back in for approval.

43:49.628 --> 43:50.426
- Yes.

43:50.462 --> 43:51.260
- That one, this one.

43:51.296 --> 43:52.095
- Okay.
- Hi!

43:52.130 --> 43:53.229
Surprise!

43:53.264 --> 43:55.098
Mr. McAwesome,
reporting for duty.

43:55.166 --> 43:56.499
- Thank you.

43:56.534 --> 43:58.001
You're wonderful for bringing
that, I appreciate it.

43:58.036 --> 44:00.603
- Do you have any toys
here like my mom's office?

44:00.672 --> 44:01.838
- No, I wish.

44:01.873 --> 44:04.374
- But we do have a
model of the light rail.

44:04.409 --> 44:06.309
You want to see?

44:06.344 --> 44:07.310
Yeah?

44:07.345 --> 44:08.211
Okay, let's go.

44:08.246 --> 44:09.045
- Thank you.

44:09.080 --> 44:09.879
- You're welcome.

44:09.914 --> 44:10.713
- She's too much.

44:10.749 --> 44:12.548
- She's amazing.

44:12.584 --> 44:13.783
Hi.

44:13.818 --> 44:14.951
- Hey there, I'm
glad you're here.

44:14.986 --> 44:15.785
Cause I keep thinking
about your short.

44:15.820 --> 44:16.686
- Oh yeah?

44:16.721 --> 44:18.021
- Yeah, I have a few notes.

44:18.056 --> 44:19.188
- Oh, really?

44:19.224 --> 44:20.189
- No, I don't.

44:21.159 --> 44:22.392
But I do have a thought here.

44:22.460 --> 44:24.494
You said it's a story
about courage, right?

44:24.529 --> 44:25.928
- I did.

44:25.964 --> 44:30.266
- Isn't love the most perfect
motivator for courage?

44:31.970 --> 44:36.139
- I mean, it's a little
limited, don't you think?

44:36.174 --> 44:38.975
People can be brave
for a lot of reasons.

44:39.010 --> 44:39.976
- I don't know.

44:40.011 --> 44:41.310
The world is a lot less scary

44:41.346 --> 44:43.212
when no matter where you land,

44:43.248 --> 44:46.149
you always know
where you belong.

44:46.217 --> 44:48.551
And that helps you
take bigger chances,

44:48.586 --> 44:51.954
that gives you
something to fight for.

44:51.990 --> 44:54.691
Do you know what I mean?

44:54.726 --> 44:55.558
- No.

44:57.462 --> 45:01.531
To be honest, I don't
think I've ever felt that.

45:01.566 --> 45:02.932
- Eric.

45:03.001 --> 45:04.067
- Hey!

45:04.102 --> 45:05.501
- Sorry.

45:05.537 --> 45:07.904
Travel wrapped early, so
I just hopped a flight

45:07.939 --> 45:09.605
so I could make our
phone date a real date.

45:09.674 --> 45:10.573
- Yes, alright, let me see--

45:10.608 --> 45:11.741
- Hey.

45:11.776 --> 45:12.542
- If we can get a
sitter, maybe we can--

45:12.577 --> 45:13.710
- I'll take Owen.

45:13.745 --> 45:14.477
- Oh, I'm sorry,
Kate, this is Bianca,

45:14.512 --> 45:15.378
Bianca, this is Kate.

45:15.413 --> 45:16.312
- Uh, hi.

45:16.347 --> 45:17.046
- Oh, you're Sophia's mom.

45:17.082 --> 45:17.980
- Yeah.
- Hi.

45:18.016 --> 45:18.748
It's so nice to meet you.

45:18.817 --> 45:19.549
- Nice to meet you too.

45:19.584 --> 45:21.150
- Are you sure?

45:21.186 --> 45:22.685
- Sophia would be thrilled.

45:22.721 --> 45:24.787
- Okay, oh my gosh, thank you.

45:24.823 --> 45:27.690
We'll drop him off
on the way to dinner.

45:27.726 --> 45:28.558
- Okay.

45:29.894 --> 45:31.627
That's great.

45:31.663 --> 45:32.929
That's great, that's great.

45:32.964 --> 45:34.497
So great.

45:34.532 --> 45:38.367
So I'll just see you
two lovebirds later?

45:38.436 --> 45:39.535
- On the way to
dinner, thank you.

45:39.604 --> 45:40.703
- On the way to
dinner, that's right.

45:40.772 --> 45:41.771
Okay, Sophia!

45:46.578 --> 45:47.777
Which one do you
think is the solid?

45:47.812 --> 45:48.611
- Solid.

45:48.646 --> 45:49.879
- Yes, very good.

45:49.914 --> 45:50.780
- Hey guys!

45:50.815 --> 45:51.848
- Ah!
- Daddy!

45:51.883 --> 45:52.782
- Hey!
- Hi.

45:53.718 --> 45:54.517
What's up, kiddo?

45:54.552 --> 45:56.853
Oh, so good to see you.

45:56.888 --> 45:57.787
- How was Bali?

45:57.856 --> 45:58.921
- It was unbelievable.

46:00.191 --> 46:01.257
Wait 'til you see
the shots I got.

46:01.326 --> 46:04.093
The temples, the
beaches, the sunsets.

46:05.330 --> 46:06.095
The music.

46:07.665 --> 46:08.698
That's yours.

46:09.934 --> 46:11.067
- Thanks, Dad.

46:11.136 --> 46:12.301
- Of course.

46:12.337 --> 46:14.370
- Yes, thank you
so much for that.

46:14.405 --> 46:15.371
That is gonna be the gift

46:15.406 --> 46:16.806
that's gonna keep on giving.

46:16.841 --> 46:17.974
- Well, it's a good
thing that I got you

46:18.009 --> 46:19.642
this rare gourmet coffee blend

46:19.677 --> 46:20.443
to help power you through.

46:20.478 --> 46:21.944
- It is a great thing!

46:23.882 --> 46:24.847
Ah, coffee.

46:24.883 --> 46:25.782
Let me see the pictures.

46:25.817 --> 46:27.450
Oh, this smells so good.

46:27.485 --> 46:29.552
Thank you, thank you
so much for this.

46:29.621 --> 46:30.486
- You're welcome.

46:30.522 --> 46:31.420
I've got so many good shots.

46:31.456 --> 46:33.589
- Oh, I love that.

46:35.760 --> 46:37.994
- Dad, there is
someone very important

46:38.029 --> 46:39.195
I would like you to meet.

46:39.264 --> 46:40.296
- Oh, yes.

46:40.331 --> 46:41.731
The famous Bruce.

46:43.268 --> 46:44.500
Hi, Bruce.

46:44.569 --> 46:45.501
Oh, no, the pleasure
is all mine, buddy.

46:46.938 --> 46:49.639
- I'm gonna go take
him to the backyard.

46:49.674 --> 46:50.606
- Okay.
- Okay.

46:50.642 --> 46:51.641
- Come on, Bruce.

46:51.709 --> 46:52.542
- Have fun, sweetie.
- Okay.

46:52.577 --> 46:54.210
Bye, Bruce.

46:55.814 --> 46:59.048
- So is it okay if I take
Sophia to my place tonight?

46:59.083 --> 47:00.516
- No, actually.

47:00.552 --> 47:02.251
Cause Owen's coming
over tonight.

47:02.287 --> 47:03.686
- Who?

47:03.721 --> 47:05.421
- The little boy, Owen,
that we share the dog with.

47:05.456 --> 47:06.522
His dad's going on a date,

47:06.558 --> 47:07.690
so I agreed to watch him.

47:07.725 --> 47:09.192
- Oh, so the kids are friends.

47:09.227 --> 47:10.092
- Best friends.

47:10.161 --> 47:11.828
We go to the park, we go hiking,

47:11.863 --> 47:16.065
which I gotta say, is
not Eric's strong suit.

47:16.100 --> 47:17.200
- Who's Eric?

47:18.603 --> 47:19.402
- Owen's dad.

47:19.437 --> 47:20.636
Oh!

47:20.672 --> 47:24.240
He totally roped me
into joining the PTA.

47:24.309 --> 47:25.474
- You?

47:25.510 --> 47:26.976
How?

47:27.011 --> 47:28.878
- Well, he wanted Bruce
to go to obedience school,

47:28.913 --> 47:30.112
so we made a deal.

47:30.148 --> 47:34.016
I get the choose the
school, if I volunteer.

47:34.052 --> 47:37.353
And I chose this
like fuzzy, you know,

47:37.388 --> 47:38.721
feeling-sy place,

47:38.790 --> 47:41.490
and I wish you
could've seen his face

47:41.526 --> 47:43.259
when he walked through the door.

47:43.294 --> 47:44.260
It was...

47:49.267 --> 47:50.099
Um, funny.

47:51.169 --> 47:52.635
It was funny.

47:52.670 --> 47:54.170
- You like him!

47:54.239 --> 47:55.137
- No, I do not.

47:55.173 --> 47:56.072
He--

47:56.107 --> 47:57.573
- Kate Healy, I have known you--

47:57.609 --> 47:59.041
- He is such a nice guy!
- Since the seventh grade.

47:59.077 --> 47:59.709
- Okay, you think you know me.
- You are smitten right now.

47:59.744 --> 48:00.543
- What?

48:00.578 --> 48:01.777
He has a girlfriend!

48:01.813 --> 48:02.778
- Yeah, and you are
watching his kid

48:02.814 --> 48:05.081
so he can go out on a date?

48:16.794 --> 48:19.061
- So, we just throw them?

48:19.097 --> 48:21.898
- Yeah, well, at
the canvas ideally.

48:21.933 --> 48:23.099
- And we won't get in trouble?

48:23.167 --> 48:25.735
- Anything above the
tarp is fair game.

48:25.770 --> 48:26.569
Ready?

48:27.605 --> 48:28.905
One, two, three!

48:39.384 --> 48:40.616
- Welcome home.

48:44.789 --> 48:45.788
That's nice.

48:49.360 --> 48:52.261
- So do you remember
that old married couple

48:52.297 --> 48:54.096
in the Chicago office
I told you about?

48:54.132 --> 48:55.364
- Yeah, the one who

48:55.433 --> 48:57.166
they are always fighting
with each other?

48:57.201 --> 48:58.301
- Yes.

48:58.336 --> 49:00.336
Larry, enough with
the printing already.

49:00.405 --> 49:01.570
Rhonda, you know I
can't concentrate

49:01.606 --> 49:02.505
without a hard copy.

49:04.342 --> 49:05.741
- I'm so glad we don't get under

49:05.777 --> 49:08.077
each other's skin like that.

49:10.081 --> 49:10.947
- So the other night,

49:10.982 --> 49:13.482
I forgot my keys at the office.

49:13.551 --> 49:15.551
So I had to double back,

49:16.487 --> 49:19.021
and there was Larry and Rhonda,

49:19.057 --> 49:20.923
slow dancing in the office.

49:20.959 --> 49:22.425
He's cracking jokes in her ear,

49:22.460 --> 49:24.360
and she's laughing and laughing.

49:24.395 --> 49:25.361
- Larry and Rhonda.

49:25.396 --> 49:27.897
- Larry, Rhonda.

49:27.932 --> 49:29.098
- See, that goes to show you,

49:29.167 --> 49:30.066
you just don't know what's

49:30.101 --> 49:32.234
underneath the surface there.

49:32.270 --> 49:33.436
- Yeah, maybe.

49:34.605 --> 49:37.340
Or maybe I just
had the wrong idea.

49:38.343 --> 49:39.709
- What do you mean?

49:39.744 --> 49:40.977
- I don't know.

49:42.347 --> 49:45.147
I thought their bickering was

49:45.183 --> 49:47.483
the spark fizzling out but

49:47.518 --> 49:50.686
maybe it was more
than irritation.

49:50.722 --> 49:54.690
See, they hold each other
to their best selves.

49:54.726 --> 49:56.058
Even when they drive
each other crazy,

49:56.127 --> 49:58.361
and that's real connection.

50:00.531 --> 50:03.466
And I think maybe
that's real love.

50:06.871 --> 50:10.006
And maybe I just
didn't get it before.

50:18.649 --> 50:20.983
- We don't have that, do we?

50:22.253 --> 50:23.219
- I'm sorry.

50:25.423 --> 50:28.624
I was excited to have the
next steps talk with you,

50:28.693 --> 50:31.527
because you're a great guy.

50:31.562 --> 50:33.629
And I felt like I was checking

50:33.698 --> 50:35.965
the next relationship
boxes but--

50:36.034 --> 50:38.367
- To be honest, I'm relieved.

50:42.774 --> 50:44.407
For that every time I
started thinking about

50:44.442 --> 50:46.742
the next step conversation,

50:46.778 --> 50:48.244
I just went blank.

50:49.680 --> 50:53.082
And I don't know,
that's not a good sign.

50:56.154 --> 50:57.620
- So why don't we
just find somebody

50:57.655 --> 50:58.854
who makes us crazy,

50:58.890 --> 51:01.624
is this how this works now?

51:01.659 --> 51:03.159
- Maybe not crazy.

51:05.229 --> 51:07.029
Maybe just passionate.

51:08.366 --> 51:09.198
- Yeah.

51:11.035 --> 51:13.035
I like that, passionate.

51:20.845 --> 51:22.344
- Hey, come on in.

51:26.717 --> 51:28.150
How was your date?

51:28.219 --> 51:31.720
- It was, uh, you're
covered in paint.

51:31.756 --> 51:33.222
- Oh, yeah.

51:33.257 --> 51:35.891
Just a painting
experiment gone awry.

51:39.630 --> 51:40.463
What?

51:41.365 --> 51:43.265
- Nothing, nothing.

51:43.301 --> 51:45.034
I'm glad you had a
good time tonight.

51:45.069 --> 51:46.235
- Yeah.

51:46.270 --> 51:47.169
No, we did.

51:47.205 --> 51:48.037
Come on.

51:50.608 --> 51:51.740
Hey, buddy.

51:54.846 --> 51:57.480
- I hope you're doing okay, pal.

51:58.850 --> 52:00.316
- Hi, buddy.

52:00.351 --> 52:01.684
Here, his shoes.

52:22.640 --> 52:23.539
- Hey.

52:23.608 --> 52:25.474
Thanks for calling me back.

52:25.510 --> 52:28.244
- I think I got so
focused on how to share,

52:28.279 --> 52:32.248
that I forgot we need
to choose one home.

52:32.283 --> 52:33.249
- As fun as this is,

52:33.284 --> 52:34.683
it can't be forever, right?

52:34.752 --> 52:35.818
- Right.

52:35.887 --> 52:38.053
- I mean, in
theory, it could be.

52:38.089 --> 52:40.489
It seems like Bruce will
have a happy home either way.

52:40.558 --> 52:43.125
So as a representative
of the shelter,

52:43.161 --> 52:45.127
there's no problem on our end.

52:45.196 --> 52:46.962
- I'm sensing a but.

52:47.031 --> 52:49.298
- Look, I can't
tell you what to do.

52:49.367 --> 52:51.367
My job is to look after Bruce,

52:51.402 --> 52:53.602
but if it were me,

52:53.638 --> 52:54.937
it would only get
harder to say goodbye

52:54.972 --> 52:56.772
the longer I had with him.

52:56.841 --> 52:59.108
It might be better to
just rip the bandaid off,

52:59.177 --> 53:00.943
so to speak.

53:01.012 --> 53:02.912
- I understand.

53:02.947 --> 53:03.779
Thank you.

53:06.417 --> 53:07.416
- Thank you.

53:30.775 --> 53:32.074
- How's the world's
best dog doing?

53:32.109 --> 53:33.809
- He learned two new
tricks this week.

53:33.878 --> 53:34.944
- He's a good boy.

53:34.979 --> 53:36.712
- The best boy.

53:36.747 --> 53:37.613
- Hey, Owen.

53:37.648 --> 53:39.648
If Bruce lives with me,

53:39.717 --> 53:42.318
I promise, I'll still
share him with you.

53:42.386 --> 53:43.285
- Oh.

53:43.321 --> 53:46.522
Okay, but, if he lives with me,

53:46.557 --> 53:49.391
I'll still share
him with you too.

54:01.672 --> 54:03.372
- Owen, keep him
on the leash, bud!

54:03.407 --> 54:04.873
- Okay, Dad!

54:04.909 --> 54:05.841
Hi, Sophia.

54:08.079 --> 54:08.877
- Hey!

54:08.913 --> 54:10.212
- Ah.

54:10.248 --> 54:11.247
Sorry we're late.

54:11.315 --> 54:12.414
- Mm, no worries.

54:12.483 --> 54:14.183
I got here a little
early anyway.

54:14.218 --> 54:16.986
I'm just trying
to clear my head.

54:21.459 --> 54:23.259
You have news?

54:23.294 --> 54:24.593
- What?

54:24.629 --> 54:26.328
- You're never late.

54:27.632 --> 54:29.632
- Nothing, it's nothing.

54:32.637 --> 54:33.569
- Spill it.

54:34.405 --> 54:36.238
- Okay.

54:36.274 --> 54:38.073
It's a job opportunity,

54:38.109 --> 54:39.842
at a housing advocacy group.

54:39.910 --> 54:41.744
- That's amazing!

54:41.779 --> 54:42.945
Did you apply?

54:42.980 --> 54:44.113
- No.

54:44.148 --> 54:45.047
- Why?

54:45.082 --> 54:47.716
Isn't that your dream job?

54:47.752 --> 54:50.052
- There's just been a
lot of change this month.

54:50.087 --> 54:53.255
With Bruce, and Bianca
and I breaking up.

54:53.291 --> 54:54.123
- Yeah.

54:55.026 --> 54:56.859
I mean, yeah, you did?

54:58.396 --> 55:01.797
Oh, I'm really sorry
to hear about that.

55:01.866 --> 55:03.332
That's very rough.

55:05.436 --> 55:07.002
That's a...

55:07.038 --> 55:07.836
- Carla?

55:07.872 --> 55:08.871
- Yeah, yep.

55:11.776 --> 55:14.009
But I am, I'm sorry though.

55:15.346 --> 55:16.879
- Yeah?

55:16.914 --> 55:17.746
- Yeah.

55:21.352 --> 55:22.384
So, this job.

55:24.288 --> 55:25.854
- Yeah, this job.
- Yeah.

55:25.890 --> 55:28.290
- It'd also be a pretty
big career pivot on paper.

55:28.326 --> 55:30.192
- Oh, nonsense.

55:30.227 --> 55:31.527
You've been in
government for years.

55:31.562 --> 55:33.529
All you have to do
is just, you know,

55:33.597 --> 55:34.930
get creative, and then show them

55:34.965 --> 55:37.166
how passionate you
are about this.

55:37.201 --> 55:38.367
Right?

55:38.436 --> 55:40.035
- Those are not fireflies.

55:40.104 --> 55:41.270
- Oh, no.

55:41.305 --> 55:42.471
My boss reviewed my short,

55:42.506 --> 55:46.642
and he told me that my
ending was uninspired,

55:46.677 --> 55:48.911
so I'm trying to
get out of my head,

55:48.946 --> 55:50.779
and get into my heart,

55:52.817 --> 55:54.083
so, hence that.

55:57.588 --> 56:00.255
- Can you get a sitter tomorrow?

56:02.960 --> 56:04.460
- I think so.

56:04.528 --> 56:07.429
Liam's back, maybe
he could watch him.

56:07.465 --> 56:08.764
Why?

56:08.799 --> 56:10.265
- I have an idea.

56:10.301 --> 56:11.667
Something that might help
give you some perspective.

56:11.702 --> 56:13.001
- Oh.

56:13.037 --> 56:14.670
Thank you, I'm all ears.

56:14.705 --> 56:16.071
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

56:16.107 --> 56:17.439
If we're trying to get
you out of your head,

56:17.508 --> 56:20.275
I think it should be a surprise.

56:20.344 --> 56:21.477
What do you say?

56:21.512 --> 56:22.811
You game?

56:22.847 --> 56:25.247
- Why do you want to help me?

56:26.851 --> 56:31.220
- We might as well have each
other's backs right now.

56:35.493 --> 56:36.325
- Yeah.

56:38.129 --> 56:38.961
Yeah.

56:40.164 --> 56:40.963
I'm game.

56:42.433 --> 56:43.265
- Okay.

56:47.805 --> 56:50.005
He gets three stories.

56:50.040 --> 56:50.839
The last one you could read,

56:50.908 --> 56:51.840
it could be a calm one,

56:51.909 --> 56:52.975
he gets super amped up

56:53.010 --> 56:54.143
if you read anything
that's like,

56:54.178 --> 56:56.512
a superhero, or space, or...

57:02.086 --> 57:03.619
- You look like a princess.

57:03.654 --> 57:06.989
- Thank you.

57:10.261 --> 57:12.027
- Alright, you two
kids come with me.

57:12.062 --> 57:13.529
It's dinner time.

57:14.565 --> 57:16.131
And you kids have fun.

57:16.200 --> 57:17.199
- Thank you.

57:31.015 --> 57:33.215
- I should've known you'd take

57:33.250 --> 57:36.318
get some perspective literally.

57:37.688 --> 57:39.154
- A little birdie named Carla

57:39.190 --> 57:41.056
told me that you were a
bit of an astronomy geek.

57:41.125 --> 57:42.024
- Oh, no.

57:42.059 --> 57:43.358
You hit it out of the park.

57:43.394 --> 57:45.127
I have been dying to come here.

57:45.162 --> 57:47.696
But it's always been
too late for Sophia,

57:47.731 --> 57:48.797
past her bedtime.

57:48.833 --> 57:50.032
- Oh, sure.

57:50.100 --> 57:52.000
Well now we're grown
ups, with a sitter.

57:52.036 --> 57:53.368
- Look at us!
- Wow.

57:53.437 --> 57:54.603
- Look at us.
- Wow.

57:54.638 --> 57:55.437
- I know, right?
- We're doing it.

57:55.473 --> 57:56.605
- Look at this.

57:56.640 --> 57:59.274
- This is fantastic,
and laminated.

57:59.310 --> 58:01.076
- Oh, yeah.
- Very nice.

58:01.111 --> 58:03.145
- I love the myth about
that star and that star

58:03.180 --> 58:05.414
once being a peasant and
princess who fell in love.

58:05.449 --> 58:06.582
- And let me guess,

58:06.617 --> 58:09.017
they lived happily ever after.

58:09.086 --> 58:10.385
- Kind of.
- Mhm.

58:10.421 --> 58:11.787
- More of a Romeo and
Juliet sort of thing

58:11.822 --> 58:13.322
where they put this gigantic

58:13.390 --> 58:15.290
celestial river between
the two of them,

58:15.326 --> 58:16.391
otherwise known as--

58:16.427 --> 58:18.727
- The Milky Way.
- Milky Way.

58:18.762 --> 58:19.561
- Man.

58:20.397 --> 58:22.564
Dating is hard everywhere.

58:24.468 --> 58:25.601
Stars.

58:25.636 --> 58:27.636
They're just like us.

58:29.840 --> 58:31.940
But that's not the
end of the story.

58:32.009 --> 58:33.408
- Oh, no.

58:33.444 --> 58:36.612
One night a year, the
stars align just so

58:36.680 --> 58:39.581
to create a bridge
to reunite them.

58:41.185 --> 58:42.985
That's my favorite story.

58:43.020 --> 58:44.920
- That's your favorite?

58:46.590 --> 58:47.589
It's so sad!

58:48.526 --> 58:49.291
- What?

58:49.326 --> 58:50.859
Oh no.

58:50.895 --> 58:51.693
It's hopeful.

58:51.729 --> 58:52.961
- Hopeful?

58:52.997 --> 58:56.031
Please, they're two
star-crossed lovers.

58:56.066 --> 58:57.199
- I saw what you
did there, good pun.

58:57.234 --> 58:59.768
- Mhm, spend eternity
pining for the one

58:59.803 --> 59:02.104
person they can't have.

59:02.139 --> 59:03.872
There are plenty of
stars in the sky,

59:03.941 --> 59:05.674
it's like come on,
move it along, folks.

59:05.709 --> 59:07.009
- No, but it's hopeful,

59:07.044 --> 59:09.311
because to never
experience a love that big

59:09.346 --> 59:12.748
is far worse than the
pain of missing someone.

59:12.783 --> 59:16.018
It doesn't get more
romantic than that.

59:20.824 --> 59:22.791
- What would they
be missing out on?

59:22.826 --> 59:24.560
- Well, for one,
she's one of the

59:24.595 --> 59:26.395
top five brightest
stars in the sky.

59:26.430 --> 59:28.864
So, I mean, what guy
in his right mind

59:28.899 --> 59:30.732
is gonna pass that up?

59:31.969 --> 59:33.368
- What about her?

59:35.573 --> 59:36.405
- Passion.

59:38.242 --> 59:40.075
Satisfaction knowing
that she didn't settle,

59:40.110 --> 59:41.276
and assurance.

59:43.514 --> 59:44.513
- Assurance.

59:45.716 --> 59:46.615
What assurance?

59:46.684 --> 59:48.317
They can't even be together.

59:48.352 --> 59:49.985
- How many people can say,

59:50.020 --> 59:53.488
even if it's for
one night a year,

59:53.524 --> 59:54.923
that in that moment,

59:54.992 --> 59:58.727
they were right where
they were supposed to be?

01:00:11.742 --> 01:00:12.908
Full disclosure.

01:00:12.943 --> 01:00:14.076
I didn't get to go
grocery shopping

01:00:14.111 --> 01:00:15.310
like I had planned,

01:00:15.346 --> 01:00:19.615
and so our menu tonight
is 87% kid friendly.

01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:21.116
- Fantastic.

01:00:21.151 --> 01:00:22.784
What do you got?

01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:24.553
- Oh, I got cheese puffs.

01:00:24.588 --> 01:00:25.887
- Yeah!

01:00:25.923 --> 01:00:28.624
- I have a bottle of
wine labeled "red".

01:00:28.692 --> 01:00:29.458
- Red.

01:00:29.526 --> 01:00:30.292
- Yes.

01:00:31.295 --> 01:00:32.260
Definitely adult approved.

01:00:32.296 --> 01:00:33.295
Now this vintage, I've been told

01:00:33.364 --> 01:00:35.797
pairs very well with the PB&--

01:00:37.368 --> 01:00:39.701
- You had me at cheese puff.

01:00:41.605 --> 01:00:45.240
Cheese puffs make
everything better.

01:00:45.275 --> 01:00:46.408
- Really, cheese puffs?

01:00:46.443 --> 01:00:47.576
- Mhm.

01:00:47.645 --> 01:00:48.810
- Anything could've
happened tonight,

01:00:48.846 --> 01:00:49.978
but as long as it ended
with cheese puffs,

01:00:50.014 --> 01:00:52.147
all's well that ends well?

01:00:52.182 --> 01:00:53.415
- That's right.

01:00:57.154 --> 01:00:58.053
- Cheese puff.

01:00:58.122 --> 01:00:58.954
- Mhm.

01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:06.461
Can I say something awkward?

01:01:06.497 --> 01:01:08.096
- That seems on brand.

01:01:08.132 --> 01:01:10.799
- Carla told me about your wife.

01:01:12.136 --> 01:01:14.603
I had no idea, and
I just wanted to say

01:01:14.638 --> 01:01:16.171
I'm so sorry.

01:01:16.206 --> 01:01:17.673
- Well, thank you.

01:01:20.678 --> 01:01:22.010
She was amazing.

01:01:23.347 --> 01:01:27.449
I can't help but think
how proud she would be

01:01:27.484 --> 01:01:30.419
of what Owen and I
have built since.

01:01:34.491 --> 01:01:35.624
- I didn't know her,

01:01:35.659 --> 01:01:38.193
but I can't imagine
she wouldn't be.

01:01:41.632 --> 01:01:42.631
- Your turn.

01:01:44.735 --> 01:01:45.634
- For what?

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:48.336
- Sophia's dad.

01:01:48.372 --> 01:01:49.171
What happened there?

01:01:49.206 --> 01:01:50.105
- Oh.

01:01:50.174 --> 01:01:52.107
I mean, nothing dramatic.

01:01:54.111 --> 01:01:56.411
Well, we met in high school,

01:01:58.082 --> 01:02:00.482
got married way too young.

01:02:00.517 --> 01:02:03.685
We should've known
from the beginning.

01:02:05.589 --> 01:02:06.388
Beginning.

01:02:08.992 --> 01:02:10.625
- What's wrong?

01:02:10.661 --> 01:02:13.562
- I don't need a new end,
I need a new beginning.

01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:14.396
- What do you mean?

01:02:14.465 --> 01:02:15.363
- My short.

01:02:15.399 --> 01:02:16.531
I don't need a new end,

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:17.933
I need a new beginning.

01:02:17.968 --> 01:02:19.000
I gotta go.

01:02:19.036 --> 01:02:20.102
- Mission
accomplished, let's go!

01:02:20.137 --> 01:02:21.036
- Okay, cool.
- Let's go, let's go.

01:02:22.439 --> 01:02:23.205
Did you get it?

01:02:23.273 --> 01:02:24.039
Oh, okay.

01:02:55.773 --> 01:02:56.571
- Hey, team!

01:02:56.607 --> 01:02:57.739
- Oh, come on, Kate!

01:02:57.775 --> 01:02:59.508
- Okay, sorry.

01:02:59.543 --> 01:03:00.675
Habit.

01:03:00.711 --> 01:03:01.843
I've been up all night writing

01:03:01.879 --> 01:03:03.011
a new beginning for our short.

01:03:03.046 --> 01:03:04.246
- Beginning?
- Beginning?

01:03:04.281 --> 01:03:07.682
- And a new ending,
and drum roll please...

01:03:11.155 --> 01:03:12.888
It's a romance now.

01:03:12.923 --> 01:03:13.722
- Yes!

01:03:13.757 --> 01:03:14.556
Are you serious?

01:03:14.591 --> 01:03:15.791
Is she serious?

01:03:15.826 --> 01:03:17.626
- Nobody move, or
we'll all wake up.

01:03:17.661 --> 01:03:19.060
- You were right.

01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:20.695
It's all there, I just
need your brilliant minds

01:03:20.731 --> 01:03:21.563
to bring it to life,

01:03:21.632 --> 01:03:22.798
so can we do this?

01:03:22.833 --> 01:03:24.132
- Yes, we can do it.

01:03:24.168 --> 01:03:25.834
- Okay, thank you guys.

01:03:25.869 --> 01:03:27.602
And I'll see you later.

01:03:27.638 --> 01:03:29.838
Okay.

01:03:29.873 --> 01:03:30.672
- Yes!

01:03:31.542 --> 01:03:32.440
We got it.

01:03:32.476 --> 01:03:33.275
- Finally, oh my goodness.

01:03:34.378 --> 01:03:35.410
Yes, finally.

01:03:38.749 --> 01:03:40.081
- Down and back.

01:03:40.117 --> 01:03:41.016
Perfect.

01:03:41.084 --> 01:03:42.584
Now let's talk about sealant.

01:03:42.619 --> 01:03:43.418
- Okay.

01:03:43.453 --> 01:03:44.252
- Ugh.

01:03:44.288 --> 01:03:45.053
- Kate.

01:03:45.088 --> 01:03:46.221
What are you doing here?

01:03:46.256 --> 01:03:47.389
- I'm teaching
Susan about sealant.

01:03:47.424 --> 01:03:48.323
- Oh.

01:03:48.392 --> 01:03:49.057
Go home and finish your short.

01:03:49.092 --> 01:03:49.958
- But I--

01:03:49.993 --> 01:03:50.792
- Go.

01:03:50.828 --> 01:03:51.626
- But--

01:03:51.662 --> 01:03:53.795
- No buts about it!

01:03:53.831 --> 01:03:55.597
You're not welcome here
until your short's finished.

01:03:55.632 --> 01:03:56.698
- You're not the boss of me!

01:03:56.733 --> 01:03:58.133
- No, but as
president of the PTA,

01:03:58.202 --> 01:03:59.935
my name is on that funnel
cake machine lease.

01:03:59.970 --> 01:04:01.770
- You wouldn't.

01:04:01.805 --> 01:04:03.038
- No, but I will make
sure that there is

01:04:03.073 --> 01:04:04.606
an unlimited supply
of funnel cake

01:04:04.675 --> 01:04:06.775
waiting for someone
who may happen to have

01:04:06.844 --> 01:04:08.777
a finished short.

01:04:08.846 --> 01:04:09.678
- Fine!

01:04:11.048 --> 01:04:12.514
- Maybe dial back the
caffeine a little?

01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:13.448
- Never!

01:04:13.517 --> 01:04:14.316
Sophia!

01:04:22.326 --> 01:04:23.491
- At an angle,

01:04:23.527 --> 01:04:24.960
make it like the
wind's blowing it?

01:04:24.995 --> 01:04:25.861
- Yeah, I think
that's great, and the trees.

01:04:25.896 --> 01:04:27.195
- Yep, can do that too.

01:04:27.231 --> 01:04:28.129
- That looks good.

01:04:28.165 --> 01:04:31.132
- Yeah, I like that.

01:04:31.168 --> 01:04:33.034
Just there's that one frame

01:04:33.070 --> 01:04:33.935
and when you get to the--

01:04:33.971 --> 01:04:35.036
- You already did your job,

01:04:35.105 --> 01:04:36.872
now let us do ours!

01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:37.772
Thank you.

01:04:47.251 --> 01:04:48.149
- Okay, great.

01:04:48.185 --> 01:04:49.251
- Oh, excellent.

01:04:49.286 --> 01:04:50.085
These are for "Bowl and Roll".

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:51.253
- Hi.

01:04:51.288 --> 01:04:52.354
- Hey, how's it going?

01:04:52.422 --> 01:04:53.588
- Good, we're just about to go

01:04:53.624 --> 01:04:54.890
paint some more, and
then I think we're set.

01:04:54.925 --> 01:04:55.724
- Pardon me.

01:04:55.759 --> 01:04:56.658
Hey, did you finish?

01:04:56.727 --> 01:04:58.059
- No, I just wanted to--

01:04:58.095 --> 01:04:58.894
- Sorry.

01:04:58.929 --> 01:05:00.095
- Sorry!
- Bye.

01:05:26.189 --> 01:05:27.656
- Hi.

01:05:27.691 --> 01:05:29.891
I had a million more cups
of coffee, take that!

01:05:29.927 --> 01:05:31.660
And now my team has taken over,

01:05:31.695 --> 01:05:33.895
and I kind of need
something to do.

01:05:33.964 --> 01:05:35.297
I can't let this
energy go to waste,

01:05:35.332 --> 01:05:36.798
so, I took the liberty

01:05:36.833 --> 01:05:39.534
of making you a cover letter.

01:05:39.569 --> 01:05:40.735
No excuses.

01:05:40.804 --> 01:05:44.339
Apply to the job
already, would ya?

01:05:44.374 --> 01:05:45.941
- What did she do?

01:05:45.976 --> 01:05:46.808
- Aw.

01:05:49.713 --> 01:05:52.113
You need to apply
for this job already.

01:05:52.149 --> 01:05:53.148
- I'm gonna watch it again.

01:05:53.183 --> 01:05:56.117
- Okay.

01:06:01.358 --> 01:06:02.557
- Wow.

01:06:02.592 --> 01:06:03.892
I did not think that
I was gonna make it.

01:06:03.927 --> 01:06:05.894
- You did make it.

01:06:05.929 --> 01:06:06.795
- Right?

01:06:06.830 --> 01:06:08.296
- What's that?

01:06:08.332 --> 01:06:08.997
- We've done
that, I wanna do that one.

01:06:09.066 --> 01:06:09.965
- Yeah.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.166
- Did we get to do that?

01:06:11.234 --> 01:06:12.300
- Don't worry about it!

01:06:12.336 --> 01:06:13.368
You're like, uh--

01:06:13.403 --> 01:06:14.602
- Hey, Owen!

01:06:14.638 --> 01:06:15.370
You want to do the
ring toss with me?

01:06:15.405 --> 01:06:16.204
- Oh, yeah!

01:06:18.575 --> 01:06:20.208
- That video.

01:06:20.243 --> 01:06:21.042
- I know, I know.

01:06:21.078 --> 01:06:23.178
- That was incredible.

01:06:23.213 --> 01:06:24.412
Thank you.

01:06:24.448 --> 01:06:26.915
- Well, it's the
least I could do.

01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:28.083
- I
actually think it was

01:06:28.118 --> 01:06:29.751
the literal most you could do.

01:06:35.759 --> 01:06:36.558
Hey.

01:06:36.593 --> 01:06:37.392
- Hey.

01:06:37.427 --> 01:06:39.494
- Can I take you out?

01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:41.229
A real date, no kids.

01:06:41.264 --> 01:06:44.632
I mean, maybe Bruce could come.

01:06:44.668 --> 01:06:46.568
Okay, look, I don't want
to make things weird.

01:06:46.636 --> 01:06:47.469
- Okay.

01:06:48.472 --> 01:06:49.304
- Okay?

01:06:51.241 --> 01:06:52.040
- Yeah.

01:06:53.477 --> 01:06:55.777
I think that would be okay.

01:06:55.812 --> 01:06:56.845
- Okay.

01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:57.712
Great.

01:06:59.049 --> 01:06:59.848
- Yes!

01:06:59.883 --> 01:07:00.882
- Yay!
- Hey!

01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:36.351
- You gotta say it.

01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:37.852
- You were right about
the theme, it worked.

01:07:37.888 --> 01:07:38.686
- Yeah!

01:07:38.722 --> 01:07:40.255
- Now, hey.

01:07:40.290 --> 01:07:42.657
Do you think since we
did the carnival today,

01:07:42.692 --> 01:07:43.491
it would be nice if
we could have Bruce

01:07:43.527 --> 01:07:45.493
for one more day?

01:07:45.529 --> 01:07:46.494
- You know what?

01:07:46.530 --> 01:07:48.329
Rules are rules, buddy.

01:07:48.365 --> 01:07:51.032
Especially when
they're laminated.

01:07:51.068 --> 01:07:53.902
- Okay.

01:07:53.970 --> 01:07:54.869
Hey.

01:07:54.905 --> 01:07:56.304
I had fun with you today.

01:07:56.339 --> 01:07:58.640
- Yeah, it was a great day.

01:07:58.675 --> 01:07:59.507
Thank you.

01:08:00.811 --> 01:08:02.444
- Sweet dreams.

01:08:02.479 --> 01:08:03.545
- Good night.

01:08:15.592 --> 01:08:16.825
Uh, no, no, no.

01:08:17.993 --> 01:08:20.060
We have the dog.

01:08:20.130 --> 01:08:23.798
You swore the PowerPoint
madness would end.

01:08:23.834 --> 01:08:25.466
- Hey buddy.

01:08:25.502 --> 01:08:26.301
What's that?

01:08:26.336 --> 01:08:27.535
- As you know--

01:08:27.571 --> 01:08:28.569
- We are sharing
world's best dog.

01:08:28.638 --> 01:08:30.705
- We both love Bruce so much!

01:08:30.774 --> 01:08:32.941
- And we don't want
to give him up.

01:08:32.975 --> 01:08:34.475
So we have a plan.

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:37.312
- Okay.

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:42.015
Alright.

01:08:42.085 --> 01:08:43.585
Show me this plan.

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:48.122
- Uh huh.

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:59.134
Did you get an adorable
ambush this morning?

01:08:59.202 --> 01:09:00.268
Or was that just me?

01:09:00.303 --> 01:09:01.136
- No.

01:09:02.072 --> 01:09:02.904
Well, yes.

01:09:06.042 --> 01:09:08.609
Sophia gave me
another one of her

01:09:08.678 --> 01:09:10.678
PowerPoint presentations.

01:09:10.714 --> 01:09:12.247
- Oh, I didn't.

01:09:12.282 --> 01:09:14.182
Mine was not that sophisticated.

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:15.517
But still, very impressed.

01:09:15.551 --> 01:09:17.685
It was a masterfully
coordinated--

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:18.520
- Eric.

01:09:22.091 --> 01:09:22.924
- Oh.

01:09:27.096 --> 01:09:29.197
- I'm not a rules person,

01:09:29.232 --> 01:09:31.232
but I have had one rule.

01:09:33.737 --> 01:09:35.203
Which is not to date
while Sophia's a kid

01:09:35.238 --> 01:09:36.871
because I didn't want
her to get attached

01:09:36.907 --> 01:09:40.308
to someone who wasn't
gonna stick around.

01:09:41.478 --> 01:09:44.879
And I promised myself
that when I did date,

01:09:45.948 --> 01:09:49.149
I would be so
careful and so sure--

01:09:49.185 --> 01:09:51.452
- We're gonna take it slow.

01:09:52.956 --> 01:09:57.091
We're gonna make it very
clear with the kids.

01:09:57.127 --> 01:09:59.994
- Did you and I get the
same pitch this morning?

01:10:00.063 --> 01:10:02.964
Our kids want us to
just mosey on down

01:10:02.999 --> 01:10:05.233
to the courthouse,
and get hitched,

01:10:05.268 --> 01:10:08.970
and we haven't even gone
on a first date yet.

01:10:10.307 --> 01:10:11.472
It's too fast.

01:10:12.976 --> 01:10:15.710
- I know how I feel about you,

01:10:15.745 --> 01:10:19.747
and I know I haven't felt
that way in a long time.

01:10:19.783 --> 01:10:20.548
- Eric.

01:10:22.519 --> 01:10:24.953
The look on her face
when she was so sure

01:10:25.021 --> 01:10:29.524
that you and I being together
would solve everything...

01:10:31.761 --> 01:10:34.529
I can risk my
heart, but not hers.

01:10:38.902 --> 01:10:41.669
I just think we
should, you know,

01:10:44.574 --> 01:10:46.140
take a break for now,

01:10:46.176 --> 01:10:48.943
and just let the
kids be friends.

01:10:54.884 --> 01:10:56.217
- Owen.

01:10:56.286 --> 01:10:57.485
We gotta go, buddy.

01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:59.487
- Eric, I'm so sorry.

01:10:59.522 --> 01:11:00.355
- No.

01:11:02.759 --> 01:11:03.591
It's okay.

01:11:04.694 --> 01:11:06.194
You're a good mom.

01:11:07.664 --> 01:11:08.496
I get it.

01:11:19.809 --> 01:11:21.209
- Hey!

01:11:21.244 --> 01:11:23.444
Who wants ice cream?

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:25.213
- You want ice cream?

01:11:27.951 --> 01:11:29.350
- This is a real
departure for you.

01:11:29.386 --> 01:11:30.184
- I know.

01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:31.252
- I mean, I usually--

01:11:31.288 --> 01:11:32.620
- I know.
- Love your work but--

01:11:32.689 --> 01:11:33.921
- I don't know what
I was thinking--

01:11:33.957 --> 01:11:37.659
- This has far exceeded
anything we imagined.

01:11:39.029 --> 01:11:39.994
- What?

01:11:40.030 --> 01:11:41.229
- We love it.

01:11:41.264 --> 01:11:42.497
I might be a little biased,

01:11:42.532 --> 01:11:44.165
but I've seen the
other submissions,

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:46.467
and I'd make sure you have the
first weekend in June open.

01:11:46.503 --> 01:11:47.969
- Really?

01:11:48.004 --> 01:11:49.704
- In my opinion,
you're a shoe in

01:11:49.739 --> 01:11:52.740
for the Georgia
Animation Festival.

01:11:52.809 --> 01:11:55.543
I think you're gonna
blow the judges away.

01:12:13.263 --> 01:12:14.929
- Hi, Bruce.

01:12:14.964 --> 01:12:15.763
Come on.

01:12:17.233 --> 01:12:18.633
Alright.

01:12:18.668 --> 01:12:19.901
Come on, Bruce.

01:12:26.042 --> 01:12:30.578
- I will find you, my sun
and stars, no matter how far.

01:12:32.816 --> 01:12:34.115
- Hi, Liam.

01:12:34.150 --> 01:12:35.683
- Hi.

01:12:35.719 --> 01:12:37.852
So the digital copy of
the festival invitations

01:12:37.887 --> 01:12:39.420
are in your inbox.

01:12:39.456 --> 01:12:41.022
And I had my
assistant print some

01:12:41.057 --> 01:12:43.858
on some fancy paper for you.

01:12:43.893 --> 01:12:44.892
- Thank you.

01:12:45.929 --> 01:12:48.496
- Oh boy, what happened?

01:12:48.531 --> 01:12:50.164
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:51.499
- With dog dad.

01:12:52.769 --> 01:12:54.068
- Yeah, lady, what,
you've known him

01:12:54.104 --> 01:12:56.471
for like five seconds, but sure.

01:12:56.506 --> 01:12:58.539
He's definitely the one.

01:12:58.575 --> 01:12:59.474
Hey!
- Alright.

01:12:59.509 --> 01:13:00.475
- Come on, I was watching that.

01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:01.309
- Look.

01:13:01.344 --> 01:13:03.411
I know we're exes,

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:07.615
but I like to think that
we're friends, good friends.

01:13:07.650 --> 01:13:08.883
What did he do?

01:13:12.155 --> 01:13:12.987
- Nothing.

01:13:15.091 --> 01:13:15.990
Nothing.

01:13:16.025 --> 01:13:17.792
I mean, he's amazing.

01:13:19.863 --> 01:13:21.262
- So?

01:13:21.297 --> 01:13:24.298
- So, I can't do
it to Sophia, okay?

01:13:25.101 --> 01:13:27.235
I can't risk hurting her.

01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:31.272
- Look, we raised a resilient,
loving, and smart kid.

01:13:33.109 --> 01:13:35.543
Sometimes too smart.

01:13:35.578 --> 01:13:36.778
But I don't think that's what

01:13:36.813 --> 01:13:39.480
you're worried about
here, no offense.

01:13:39.549 --> 01:13:41.616
- I don't know
why I'm so scared.

01:13:41.651 --> 01:13:42.984
- I do.

01:13:43.052 --> 01:13:46.354
You've never been
in grown up love.

01:13:46.389 --> 01:13:47.688
I'm serious.

01:13:47.724 --> 01:13:50.525
We started dating
when we were what, 17?

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:52.260
You have not been
swept off your feet

01:13:52.295 --> 01:13:53.294
as an adult.

01:13:54.597 --> 01:13:58.166
And that is an entirely
different, exhilarating,

01:13:59.369 --> 01:14:01.569
and terrifying experience.

01:14:01.604 --> 01:14:03.171
- What if I'm no good at it?

01:14:03.206 --> 01:14:04.572
- Nobody's good at it.

01:14:04.641 --> 01:14:06.207
- Okay, well, I mean,
like what if we break up?

01:14:06.242 --> 01:14:08.142
I mean, what about the kids?

01:14:08.178 --> 01:14:11.546
And Bruce, it's just,
it's such a bad plan.

01:14:11.581 --> 01:14:14.782
- Yeah but, you can't
plan this stuff out.

01:14:14.818 --> 01:14:16.117
Life likes to take a hammer

01:14:16.152 --> 01:14:17.685
to the best laid plans.

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:20.288
But the Kate Healy that I know

01:14:20.323 --> 01:14:22.857
would take all
those little pieces,

01:14:22.892 --> 01:14:24.425
and would string them together,

01:14:24.461 --> 01:14:26.861
and tell a bigger story.

01:14:26.930 --> 01:14:29.497
And she sees what could be,

01:14:29.532 --> 01:14:31.866
even when other people can't.

01:14:33.036 --> 01:14:34.502
Isn't what they pay
you the big bucks for

01:14:34.571 --> 01:14:36.237
over at that studio?

01:14:42.445 --> 01:14:43.277
- Yeah.

01:14:44.147 --> 01:14:45.379
You know, you've come a long way

01:14:45.415 --> 01:14:47.114
since the angsty teenager I met.

01:14:48.485 --> 01:14:49.917
- Yeah, whatever.

01:14:50.987 --> 01:14:51.886
- Whatever.

01:14:53.122 --> 01:14:54.388
- You better do what
makes you happy though,

01:14:54.424 --> 01:14:58.392
cause I don't have a lot
of those speeches in me.

01:15:12.108 --> 01:15:13.140
- You're late.

01:15:13.176 --> 01:15:14.308
- Sorry.

01:15:14.344 --> 01:15:15.643
Super serious game
of tetherball.

01:15:15.678 --> 01:15:18.145
- Today, we have a
super secret mission.

01:15:18.181 --> 01:15:20.781
- I love super secret missions.

01:15:22.986 --> 01:15:24.886
- Take this invitation,

01:15:24.921 --> 01:15:27.488
tell your dad it's from my mom.

01:15:28.658 --> 01:15:31.726
Super brother, do you
accept this mission?

01:15:48.611 --> 01:15:49.944
- I can do this.

01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:58.386
- Kate.

01:15:58.421 --> 01:15:59.654
- It's me.

01:15:59.689 --> 01:16:00.488
- What are
you doing here?

01:16:00.523 --> 01:16:01.322
- Hi.

01:16:04.127 --> 01:16:04.959
Here.

01:16:05.995 --> 01:16:07.228
It's for my short,

01:16:07.297 --> 01:16:09.397
they're showing it at
an animation festival,

01:16:09.465 --> 01:16:12.500
and I just wanted
to invite you guys.

01:16:12.535 --> 01:16:14.168
- I know.

01:16:14.203 --> 01:16:15.436
- You have two.

01:16:15.471 --> 01:16:17.471
- Owen just gave me one.

01:16:19.475 --> 01:16:20.374
- But I didn't--

01:16:20.443 --> 01:16:21.642
- Abort, abort!

01:16:21.678 --> 01:16:23.244
Go, go, go!

01:16:25.515 --> 01:16:26.747
- Our kids.

01:16:26.783 --> 01:16:28.416
- Well, I can't turn
down two invitations,

01:16:28.451 --> 01:16:29.250
now can I?

01:16:29.285 --> 01:16:31.619
- Great.

01:16:31.654 --> 01:16:33.220
Great.

01:16:33.256 --> 01:16:35.790
So I'll see you tomorrow.

01:16:35.825 --> 01:16:37.224
- Yeah, great.

01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:38.125
- Awesome, cool.

01:16:38.161 --> 01:16:39.293
I'm gonna see you there?

01:16:39.329 --> 01:16:40.428
- Yeah.
- Yep.

01:16:54.510 --> 01:16:55.509
- That's it.

01:16:59.716 --> 01:17:00.648
Yeah, here you go.

01:17:00.683 --> 01:17:01.482
See?

01:17:01.517 --> 01:17:02.416
Easy peasy.

01:17:07.023 --> 01:17:08.823
- You look beautiful.

01:17:13.229 --> 01:17:14.528
- Go, go, go, go!

01:17:14.564 --> 01:17:15.830
Go, go, go, go.

01:17:16.833 --> 01:17:19.166
- Um, I think we're in here.

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:26.540
This is us, we're right here.

01:17:37.787 --> 01:17:40.454
- Welcome to the animated
short film competition.

01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:41.822
This year's nominees
will compete

01:17:41.891 --> 01:17:43.290
for a chance to submit

01:17:43.326 --> 01:17:46.060
for the Academy Awards
"Animated Short" category.

01:17:46.095 --> 01:17:48.129
Please stay seated
after our presentation

01:17:48.164 --> 01:17:50.364
for a Q&A with our creators.

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:51.632
Enjoy.

01:19:08.044 --> 01:19:09.610
- I'd like to turn
the discussion

01:19:09.679 --> 01:19:12.847
over to Kate Healy's charming
short, Light The Way.

01:19:14.016 --> 01:19:15.683
You know, it's a hard thing

01:19:15.718 --> 01:19:17.752
to make an audience
believe in love again

01:19:17.787 --> 01:19:19.820
in eight minutes or less.

01:19:20.857 --> 01:19:22.389
- Well.

01:19:22.425 --> 01:19:25.593
You can thank my
team for that one.

01:19:25.661 --> 01:19:28.696
Honestly, I was
completely against

01:19:28.731 --> 01:19:30.965
a romantic ending
for this short.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.199
- Really?

01:19:32.235 --> 01:19:33.634
Well, what made you
change your mind?

01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:35.970
- Well, when we first started
working on the project,

01:19:36.005 --> 01:19:38.372
I had written love
off as a cliche.

01:19:38.441 --> 01:19:41.041
I was pretty sure
that I had been there,

01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:44.211
seen the trailer,
wasn't missing much.

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:46.614
You know what I mean?

01:19:46.649 --> 01:19:49.750
But then someone
very important to me

01:19:53.089 --> 01:19:55.923
showed me just
what I was missing.

01:19:56.793 --> 01:19:57.992
Oh.

01:19:58.060 --> 01:20:01.228
It can shake parts of you awake

01:20:01.264 --> 01:20:05.966
that you thought you would
have to tuck away forever.

01:20:06.002 --> 01:20:09.436
Because love is one
of the only ways

01:20:09.472 --> 01:20:12.540
that we show each
other that we belong.

01:20:12.575 --> 01:20:15.309
And everybody
deserves to belong.

01:20:18.114 --> 01:20:20.848
Dramatic fireflies,
shelter dogs,

01:20:24.854 --> 01:20:25.953
maybe even me.

01:20:37.433 --> 01:20:38.199
- Mom.

01:20:38.234 --> 01:20:39.400
- Yeah.

01:20:39.468 --> 01:20:40.234
- I'm gonna go show
Owen your award.

01:20:40.303 --> 01:20:41.302
- Okay.

01:20:57.119 --> 01:20:58.419
- Hi.

01:20:58.454 --> 01:20:59.687
- Hi.

01:20:59.755 --> 01:21:02.089
- Congrats on the
Grand Jury Prize.

01:21:02.124 --> 01:21:04.291
Your short was incredible.

01:21:06.195 --> 01:21:07.795
- You liked it?

01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:09.263
- No, I loved it.

01:21:11.601 --> 01:21:13.400
I had an interview with the

01:21:13.436 --> 01:21:16.136
affordable housing
advocacy group yesterday,

01:21:16.172 --> 01:21:17.538
and I have a follow
up next week.

01:21:17.573 --> 01:21:19.039
- Of course you do.

01:21:19.075 --> 01:21:20.875
Tell me everything.

01:21:20.910 --> 01:21:22.109
- First thing they asked about

01:21:22.144 --> 01:21:24.778
was my very creative
cover letter.

01:21:24.814 --> 01:21:26.380
So thank you.

01:21:26.415 --> 01:21:27.681
So I told them that,
long story short,

01:21:27.717 --> 01:21:31.285
I met this infuriatingly zany,

01:21:31.354 --> 01:21:33.854
insanely talented woman

01:21:33.890 --> 01:21:36.190
who reminded me that life was

01:21:36.225 --> 01:21:38.158
way too short to waste any time

01:21:38.194 --> 01:21:40.194
not doing what you love.

01:21:43.532 --> 01:21:46.166
- She sounds like a wise woman.

01:21:47.737 --> 01:21:50.704
Let's say, hypothetically,

01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:53.073
this wise woman decided that

01:21:54.844 --> 01:21:56.777
she didn't know everything.

01:21:56.812 --> 01:21:58.345
- Okay.

01:21:58.381 --> 01:22:03.217
- And, hypothetically, dinner
doesn't sound like Armageddon.

01:22:05.221 --> 01:22:06.053
- No.

01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:08.422
Stop.

01:22:08.457 --> 01:22:11.191
One date would not be
the end of the world?

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:12.092
- Mm, no.

01:22:13.429 --> 01:22:16.230
I think it actually
might be nice.

01:22:24.407 --> 01:22:26.540
- So, what are we
gonna do with this dog?

01:22:26.575 --> 01:22:28.542
- I don't know.

01:22:28.577 --> 01:22:29.810
- I cannot, in good conscience,

01:22:29.879 --> 01:22:32.279
leave this dog with
some wild, unruly--

01:22:32.315 --> 01:22:33.447
- Unruly?

01:22:33.482 --> 01:22:34.615
- Oh, yeah.

01:22:34.650 --> 01:22:36.016
- Well then I
can't leave the dog

01:22:36.052 --> 01:22:38.352
with some tyrant who's
just gonna break his spirit

01:22:38.387 --> 01:22:40.387
and we're never gonna...

01:23:01.010 --> 01:23:01.842
Hi, buddy.

01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:05.012
Hi.

01:23:06.716 --> 01:23:08.949
Alright guys, let's go home.

01:23:08.985 --> 01:23:09.850
Right, Bruce?

01:23:09.885 --> 01:23:11.352
Let's go home.

01:23:11.387 --> 01:23:12.186
Yeah!
