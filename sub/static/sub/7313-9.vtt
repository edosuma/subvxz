WEBVTT

00:04.043 --> 00:05.956
We're going down!Chaplain Burke.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.478
I just transferred to the chapel
here on the Navy Yard.

00:08.521 --> 00:09.956
Her body was on that plane.

00:10.000 --> 00:10.913
What's her name?

00:10.956 --> 00:12.869
First Lieutenant
Gabriela Flores.

00:12.913 --> 00:14.434
There were only two Marines,

00:14.478 --> 00:15.434
and those were three cases.

00:15.478 --> 00:17.043
And Flores wasn't one of them.

00:17.086 --> 00:19.043
We will do whatever
it takes to find her
and bring her home.

00:19.086 --> 00:20.565
No Marine is ever left behind.

00:20.608 --> 00:22.478
McGEE: Flores was blindsided
in an attack

00:22.521 --> 00:24.391
on a girls' school
she was helping rebuild.

00:24.434 --> 00:26.478
It was the people
she was working with?

00:26.521 --> 00:28.000
That's the teacher.

00:28.043 --> 00:29.739
Anyone that worked at that
school could be in on this.

00:29.782 --> 00:30.652
That's gotta be here.

00:30.695 --> 00:32.043
BURKE:
Are those children?!

00:32.086 --> 00:33.608
She was trying to save them,
and she got caught.

00:33.652 --> 00:35.086
Don't come back without her.

01:18.869 --> 01:22.086
Go ahead. Ask.

01:25.869 --> 01:28.043
Ask what?

01:28.086 --> 01:30.956
Tell Him
what you're thinking.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.391
In my experience,

01:32.434 --> 01:35.478
He's not a big talker,

01:35.521 --> 01:38.086
but His actions speak volumes.

01:38.130 --> 01:41.521
His actions have been
questionable.

01:42.608 --> 01:46.434
Your daughter, Gabriela,

01:46.478 --> 01:48.782
tried to save those kids.

01:48.826 --> 01:53.043
She dedicated her life
to serving her country.

01:53.086 --> 01:56.043
If she's any indication
of His actions,

01:56.086 --> 01:57.652
then I have to disagree.

01:57.695 --> 02:00.043
She should have gone back
to base that night.

02:00.086 --> 02:01.739
She should have
followed orders.

02:01.782 --> 02:04.869
Yes.

02:04.913 --> 02:08.608
But by following
her instincts,

02:08.652 --> 02:12.608
maybe she was following
His orders instead.

02:20.652 --> 02:23.826
Can Gibbs bring her back?

02:23.869 --> 02:25.826
Well, look,
I haven't known

02:25.869 --> 02:27.304
Special Agent Gibbs
for very long,

02:27.347 --> 02:30.347
but he's a good man and he's
working with the best.

02:30.391 --> 02:33.391
So I have faith
they they will do

02:33.434 --> 02:35.478
everything they can
to find her.

02:35.521 --> 02:38.478
I know they'll
find her, Chaplain.

02:38.521 --> 02:41.826
The question is
will she be alive?

02:41.869 --> 02:43.913
[door opens]

02:48.565 --> 02:50.434
Agent DiNozzo,

02:50.478 --> 02:52.608
what is it?

04:01.173 --> 04:02.782
Captain.

04:02.826 --> 04:04.478
Special Agent Gibbs.

04:04.521 --> 04:06.086
Welcome to the belly
of the beast.

04:06.130 --> 04:07.521
Smooth ride?

04:07.565 --> 04:08.869
Till somebody started
shooting at us.

04:08.913 --> 04:10.391
It's Kabul's welcome wagon.

04:10.434 --> 04:12.173
Next time, bake cookies.

04:12.217 --> 04:13.260
What's the status?

04:13.304 --> 04:15.913
Got some locals
to change their story.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.000
And they confirm
Lieutenant Flores

04:17.043 --> 04:18.130
and the two girls were taken.

04:18.173 --> 04:19.652
Did they identify
the insurgents?

04:19.695 --> 04:21.391
Changing their story is
one thing,

04:21.434 --> 04:23.043
but giving up names
gets folks killed.

04:23.086 --> 04:24.521
People are afraid to talk.

04:24.565 --> 04:25.913
So why keep Flores alive?

04:25.956 --> 04:27.608
Information.

04:27.652 --> 04:28.565
Radicals don't like
Westerners

04:28.608 --> 04:30.739
opening up
their kids' eyes.

04:30.782 --> 04:33.260
167 schools were hit last year
throughout the Middle East.

04:33.304 --> 04:35.086
More than half were in
Afghanistan alone.

04:35.130 --> 04:36.782
And as a FET,
Flores knows where

04:36.826 --> 04:38.086
new ones are
being built.

04:38.130 --> 04:39.391
FETs act as a conduit

04:39.434 --> 04:40.869
between the locals
and the Corps.

04:40.913 --> 04:43.260
I'll introduce you
to Staff Sergeant Littleton.

04:43.304 --> 04:44.608
She was there that night.

04:44.652 --> 04:46.478
Schools can be a big part
of what they do.

04:46.521 --> 04:49.043
Good news is the two girls that
Flores saved were just found

04:49.086 --> 04:50.608
about seven clicks due south.

04:50.652 --> 04:51.826
Abandoned roadside.

04:51.869 --> 04:53.000
They're being transported here
for treatment.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.173
Are they all right?

04:54.217 --> 04:57.652
Dehydrated, scared,
clearly tortured.

04:57.695 --> 04:59.000
But alive.

04:59.043 --> 05:00.565
We'll need to see them.

05:00.608 --> 05:03.347
As long as you're prepared
for what you'll see.

05:03.391 --> 05:05.260
I grew up in this region.

05:05.304 --> 05:07.913
Looks like you turned out okay.

05:07.956 --> 05:09.521
I can hold my own.

05:09.565 --> 05:12.173
Copy that.

05:20.391 --> 05:21.521
Staff Sergeant Littleton.

05:21.565 --> 05:24.260
Special Agent Gibbs.

05:24.304 --> 05:26.043
C.O. said you wanted
to see me?

05:26.086 --> 05:27.521
Yeah. Sit down.

05:30.565 --> 05:32.565
Understand that you were with
Lieutenant Flores

05:32.608 --> 05:34.173
the night the school was
attacked.

05:34.217 --> 05:38.260
I already gave a statement to
the Investigative Unit, sir.

05:38.304 --> 05:40.565
Yeah, I know,
but I just got here

05:40.608 --> 05:41.826
and I'm anxious to hear.

05:41.869 --> 05:43.521
There's nothing
really different to say.

05:43.565 --> 05:45.565
Just trying
to get a clear picture.

05:47.434 --> 05:49.173
Yes, sir.

05:49.217 --> 05:54.260
A bunch of us evacuated before
all hell broke loose.

05:54.304 --> 05:57.608
I thought we were
all together in a seven-ton.

05:57.652 --> 06:01.391
I kept yelling her name,
but she didn't answer.

06:01.434 --> 06:03.434
She couldn't answer.

06:05.173 --> 06:07.956
If I'd have stayed with Gabby,
she might not be in this mess.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.043
Or you might be dead.

06:15.086 --> 06:17.521
Know that woman?

06:17.565 --> 06:19.043
Soraya?

06:19.086 --> 06:21.043
She's one of
the fortunate ones.

06:21.086 --> 06:22.695
Fortunate? How?

06:22.739 --> 06:24.521
She wasn't at school
that day.

06:24.565 --> 06:27.826
She was seeing her family
outside Kabul.

06:27.869 --> 06:30.043
Have you seen her since?

06:30.086 --> 06:32.608
No, sir.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.782
We think that she used
being a teacher

06:39.826 --> 06:42.391
to know when to strike.

06:42.434 --> 06:45.434
The kids trusted Soraya.

06:45.478 --> 06:48.043
We all did.

06:48.086 --> 06:49.869
She took advantage
of that trust.

06:49.913 --> 06:51.391
And she succeeded, sir.

06:51.434 --> 06:52.608
At being a coward.

06:54.478 --> 06:56.565
Now it's our turn.

07:04.434 --> 07:05.956
While we may believe
that everyone

07:06.000 --> 07:07.608
should be taught
to read and write,

07:07.652 --> 07:09.173
there are still some
in the Middle East

07:09.217 --> 07:10.913
who do not see it that way.

07:10.956 --> 07:12.086
Yeah, but on
the other hand,

07:12.130 --> 07:13.956
back in the Crusades,
the Knights Templar,

07:14.000 --> 07:17.826
they were willing to kill
for what they held sacred.

07:17.869 --> 07:19.782
Tragically,
in both instances,

07:19.826 --> 07:21.565
innocent children suffer.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.217
BURKE:
A battle for young
hearts and minds.

07:23.260 --> 07:25.217
And Lieutenant Flores
found herself

07:25.260 --> 07:27.043
at the very center
of that battle.

07:27.086 --> 07:30.130
Look at you two--
hitting Wong's after hours

07:30.173 --> 07:33.913
and talking the night away
like a couple of college coeds.

07:33.956 --> 07:36.000
Commander Burke offers
a perspective

07:36.043 --> 07:38.043
I find quite...
provocative.

07:38.086 --> 07:40.304
Mm! I bet you do, Ducky.

07:40.347 --> 07:42.521
[clears throat]
Anyway, we're tired

07:42.565 --> 07:44.000
and waiting for answers.

07:45.347 --> 07:46.739
That was Homeland Security.

07:46.782 --> 07:48.956
The Jaysh El-Mo'mineen

07:49.000 --> 07:50.478
have links to terror cells

07:50.521 --> 07:52.391
in Yemen, Saudi Arabia
and the Philippines.

07:52.434 --> 07:53.434
What's the next step?

07:53.478 --> 07:55.043
Well, we need
one of those cells

07:55.086 --> 07:56.695
to turn on our radicals.

07:56.739 --> 07:58.173
The less that they
trust each other,

07:58.217 --> 07:59.652
the more we can
destabilize them.

07:59.695 --> 08:02.608
What about you, Tony?Me?

08:02.652 --> 08:04.173
I hope you're not
wasting your time on

08:04.217 --> 08:07.000
that bucket list
I keep hearing about.

08:07.043 --> 08:08.695
TONY:
It's not a waste of time...

08:08.739 --> 08:10.478
O ye of little faith.

08:10.521 --> 08:12.043
Present company excluded,
of course.

08:12.086 --> 08:15.652
Yeah, I am working
on bucket list.

08:15.695 --> 08:18.782
Perhaps all this talk of
terrorism has me anxious

08:18.826 --> 08:21.521
about certain insecurities.

08:21.565 --> 08:23.652
You, DiNozzo?

08:25.782 --> 08:28.043
Yes, me.

08:28.086 --> 08:29.391
I know-- shocking--

08:29.434 --> 08:32.086
but beneath this incredibly
masculine body armor,

08:32.130 --> 08:34.695
there is a vulnerable do-gooder.

08:34.739 --> 08:37.086
Vulnerable to...?

08:37.130 --> 08:38.652
[chuckles]

08:38.695 --> 08:41.217
Yeah, telling you would be like
Superman telling

08:41.260 --> 08:45.130
Lex Luthor about his
vulnerability to Kryptonite.

08:45.173 --> 08:46.565
It's not gonna happen.

08:46.608 --> 08:48.695
So what is it, Clark Kent?

08:48.739 --> 08:51.913
What are you so afraid of?

08:51.956 --> 08:53.956
VANCE:
Good morning, Agent Gibbs.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.391
Evening, Director.

08:55.434 --> 08:58.521
That you in the background,
Mr. Secretary?

08:58.565 --> 09:00.826
Hello, Gibbs.

09:00.869 --> 09:03.086
Burning the candle
at both ends, sir.

09:03.130 --> 09:05.434
Careful, people are gonna think
you care.

09:05.478 --> 09:07.000
Nice scarf.

09:07.043 --> 09:07.869
[chuckles]

09:07.913 --> 09:09.782
Update.Boss, we got an i.d.

09:09.826 --> 09:11.826
on our loving
Afghan teacher.

09:11.869 --> 09:13.565
This is from a classified

09:13.608 --> 09:15.826
military personnel file
on the school.

09:15.869 --> 09:17.695
Full name is Soraya Zoranj.

09:17.739 --> 09:20.043
Grew up in Baghlan,
Afghanistan.

09:20.086 --> 09:21.173
Parents were killed
by the Russians

09:21.217 --> 09:22.347
when she was a teenager.

09:22.391 --> 09:24.217
Soraya also had two siblings:

09:24.260 --> 09:27.043
An older brother, Osman,
who died in an IED explosion

09:27.086 --> 09:28.739
two years ago,

09:28.782 --> 09:29.956
and a younger
brother, Asa,

09:30.000 --> 09:32.130
who's in the U.S.
on a student visa.

09:32.173 --> 09:33.608
He's going

09:33.652 --> 09:35.739
to law school
here in DC.
Talk to him.

09:35.782 --> 09:37.956
Think he might keep in contact
with the big sis?

09:38.000 --> 09:39.565
Find out.On it.

09:41.695 --> 09:45.478
Ah, McGee, I love the smell
of coeds in the morning.

09:45.521 --> 09:47.391
You need coffee, Tony.

09:47.434 --> 09:48.956
So do I.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.086
Working on Afghan time is
messing up our internal clocks.

09:52.130 --> 09:54.043
I used to thrive on
all-night stakeouts

09:54.086 --> 09:55.521
and sub-zero surveillance.

09:55.565 --> 09:58.956
Maybe this is a sign something's
missing from my life.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.608
Like what, frostbite?

10:00.652 --> 10:02.521
You guys all set?Come on. The kid's
roommate told us

10:02.565 --> 10:04.304
Asa spent all night
in the law library.

10:04.347 --> 10:05.695
Might as well start there.

10:05.739 --> 10:06.913
I hate libraries.

10:06.956 --> 10:09.173
Another one of your fears?

10:09.217 --> 10:10.173
Don't mock me.

10:10.217 --> 10:12.130
What's to hate about libraries?

10:12.173 --> 10:14.000
The smell gets me every time.

10:14.043 --> 10:16.086
Yeah? What does
a library smell like?

10:16.130 --> 10:17.434
Lonely smart people.

10:17.478 --> 10:19.000
[chuckles]

10:20.565 --> 10:22.086
Tony, that's our guy.

10:22.130 --> 10:23.391
Soraya's brother.

10:23.434 --> 10:24.956
Hey, kid-- NCIS.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.130
We'd like to talk
to you for a second.

10:27.173 --> 10:29.000
Can we ask you
a few questions?

10:29.043 --> 10:31.000
Now I'm gonna spill
my latte!

10:32.043 --> 10:32.913
Hey!

10:42.608 --> 10:44.652
You cannot do this!
I've done nothing wrong!

10:44.695 --> 10:46.478
Then why'd you run?

10:46.521 --> 10:48.130
You owe me another coffee.

10:49.347 --> 10:51.956
McGee...

11:00.217 --> 11:04.043
It's funny we should find you
with your nose in a book.

11:04.086 --> 11:06.434
Why is that funny to you?

11:06.478 --> 11:10.739
All those kids wanted
was a chance to read.

11:10.782 --> 11:12.695
Those girls...

11:12.739 --> 11:16.043
just wanted to
learn something.

11:16.086 --> 11:18.913
And yet, here you are,

11:18.956 --> 11:23.000
enjoying all the benefits
of an American education.

11:23.043 --> 11:25.608
You are a country
of extraordinary power.

11:25.652 --> 11:27.086
I see.

11:27.130 --> 11:31.000
Study the power,
find the weakness?

11:32.217 --> 11:34.565
Let me ask you
a question.

11:34.608 --> 11:36.043
You think those kids

11:36.086 --> 11:38.565
really threaten
your way of life?

11:38.608 --> 11:42.000
You know nothing
about our way of life,

11:42.043 --> 11:44.565
our culture.

11:47.086 --> 11:49.000
I know plenty.

11:50.521 --> 11:52.000
I also know a
closed-minded,

11:52.043 --> 11:54.043
radical parasite when I see one.

11:54.086 --> 11:57.260
The kind that likes to prey
on innocent children.

11:57.304 --> 11:59.304
[chuckling]

12:01.478 --> 12:03.652
Your ignorance is amusing.

12:03.695 --> 12:06.043
You know what I find amusing?

12:08.086 --> 12:11.826
The idea of you in a tiny
little orange jumpsuit,

12:11.869 --> 12:17.000
all alone in a six-by-six cell
crying for mommy.

12:17.043 --> 12:21.913
I will not spend one minute
in your filthy prison.

12:21.956 --> 12:24.000
I wouldn't bet on it.

12:24.043 --> 12:25.956
Unless, of course, you want

12:26.000 --> 12:27.565
to give us the name

12:27.608 --> 12:29.913
of your little gang
of school haters.

12:29.956 --> 12:31.739
How many are there?

12:33.130 --> 12:35.086
We are few,

12:35.130 --> 12:39.521
but we are very strong.

12:43.086 --> 12:45.565
You cannot defeat us.

12:51.130 --> 12:53.043
Say it again, DiNozzo.
You're breaking up.

12:53.086 --> 12:54.956
Soraya's little brother--
we got him.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.739
He tell you where his sister is?

12:56.782 --> 12:58.000
Not yet.

12:58.043 --> 12:59.043
But we're squeezing him.

12:59.086 --> 13:00.956
Squeeze tighter.
I need her.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.130
[static buzzes, crackles]She's the best hope we have...

13:03.173 --> 13:05.173
DiNozzo!

13:05.217 --> 13:08.652
GIBBS [quietly]:
Ah, damn it.

13:11.043 --> 13:13.130
[sighs]

13:26.000 --> 13:27.173
Hey, Matteson.

13:27.217 --> 13:28.782
Gibbs.

13:28.826 --> 13:31.000
I thought everyone was
going to the E-club.

13:31.043 --> 13:33.043
They are.

13:33.086 --> 13:34.347
Thought I'd get out instead.

13:34.391 --> 13:36.043
Hmm...

13:36.086 --> 13:38.652
You want me to take a look?

13:40.260 --> 13:42.695
No.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.000
But you can start the engine.

13:44.043 --> 13:45.434
Make yourself useful.

13:52.782 --> 13:54.173
[engine sputters]

13:54.217 --> 13:56.652
You sure you don't want me to...

13:56.695 --> 13:58.739
Again.

14:00.652 --> 14:02.608
[engine starts]

14:02.652 --> 14:04.652
[chuckles]

14:05.913 --> 14:07.869
You know, I really should
know better by now.

14:07.913 --> 14:10.478
Yes, you should.

14:10.521 --> 14:13.043
I'm headed to Pendleton soon.

14:13.086 --> 14:15.434
I heard, uh,
maybe you're going there, too.

14:16.478 --> 14:19.391
Okinawa, next week.

14:20.434 --> 14:22.043
Wow.

14:22.086 --> 14:24.521
Japan.

14:25.565 --> 14:28.000
Well, good luck over there.

14:29.478 --> 14:30.956
You know, Gibbs...

14:31.000 --> 14:35.086
if you ever find yourself
in Japan, or...

14:35.130 --> 14:38.304
you know, even if you don't...

14:38.347 --> 14:41.000
I'll always be around.

14:41.043 --> 14:43.000
Give me a call.

14:43.043 --> 14:44.956
I'd like that.

14:50.782 --> 14:53.043
ZIVA:
The girls, Gibbs.

14:53.086 --> 14:54.565
Did you hear?

14:54.608 --> 14:56.043
Hear what?

14:56.086 --> 14:57.739
I had Tony.
I lost him.

14:57.782 --> 15:00.521
The girls Flores saved--
they are here.

15:29.086 --> 15:31.130
QUINCY:
Girls are both orphans.

15:31.173 --> 15:33.782
Parents were killed
by insurgents.

15:33.826 --> 15:35.695
What are their ages?

15:35.739 --> 15:37.739
Ten and 13.

15:37.782 --> 15:39.434
Already been through more

15:39.478 --> 15:41.782
than anyone should
in a lifetime.

15:41.826 --> 15:44.086
Hot grease was thrown
in the older one's face.

15:44.130 --> 15:46.956
The other one's covered
in cigarette burns.

15:48.565 --> 15:50.695
Their names are Kinah and Lala.

15:54.043 --> 15:57.000
[speaking Pashtu]

16:03.086 --> 16:05.652
Uh, we need to ask you
some questions.

16:05.695 --> 16:07.086
Okay?

16:09.434 --> 16:12.391
Do you remember
Lieutenant Flores?

16:14.608 --> 16:17.000
Gabriela?

16:18.043 --> 16:19.565
Gabby?

16:19.608 --> 16:22.000
Gabby! Yes.She still there.

16:22.043 --> 16:23.347
You go bring?

16:23.391 --> 16:26.000
Gabby, Gabby-- she's...
she's still alive?

16:33.086 --> 16:36.086
They're not... done yet.

16:39.086 --> 16:40.260
Notify the commandant.

16:40.304 --> 16:41.826
Tell him
we're a go.

16:41.869 --> 16:44.043
Flores could
still be alive.

16:44.086 --> 16:46.000
That's very good.

17:04.043 --> 17:07.086
You know that you're
both safe here.

17:07.130 --> 17:08.913
Can you tell us
about Gabby?

17:08.956 --> 17:11.565
They hurt her.

17:11.608 --> 17:13.173
No cry.

17:13.217 --> 17:14.913
ZIVA:
Do you remember anything

17:14.956 --> 17:16.347
about where these people
took you?

17:16.391 --> 17:18.130
[sniffing]

17:19.391 --> 17:21.173
It smelled... smelled bad?

17:21.217 --> 17:23.739
Like what?

17:23.782 --> 17:25.478
Vroom, vroom.

17:25.521 --> 17:26.782
Car.

17:26.826 --> 17:30.173
And ground, it was black.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.869
Oil.

17:32.913 --> 17:34.826
Oil.
Oil.

17:36.043 --> 17:37.739
Ziva, we need a sample.

17:37.782 --> 17:40.347
And then you get them
anything they want.

17:50.391 --> 17:52.608
You never stop
smiling, okay?

17:58.869 --> 18:01.000
Abby, did you get
the sample analysis?

18:01.043 --> 18:03.652
McGee, I have decided that
I am never going to complain

18:03.695 --> 18:06.086
about anything
ever, ever again.

18:06.130 --> 18:09.173
How can I whine about the cost
of my DVD-by-mail service

18:09.217 --> 18:10.956
when there's real
problems in this world?

18:11.000 --> 18:12.260
Well, when you
put it that way.

18:12.304 --> 18:14.043
Like, take this evidence,
for example.

18:14.086 --> 18:15.391
Normally, I would whine

18:15.434 --> 18:17.260
about not being able
to examine

18:17.304 --> 18:18.478
the actual item.

18:18.521 --> 18:19.608
But given that we

18:19.652 --> 18:21.043
are 4,000 miles
from Afghanistan,

18:21.086 --> 18:22.478
we have to settle for a basic

18:22.521 --> 18:24.043
chemical breakdown
from the Marine unit.

18:24.086 --> 18:27.391
And I took their breakdown
and I made lemonade.

18:27.434 --> 18:30.956
Who knew that geochemistry
could be so cool?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.478
You know, I actually took a
college class in fossil fuels.

18:33.521 --> 18:34.869
Of course you did.

18:34.913 --> 18:37.260
Just like the chemical
compositions of plant life

18:37.304 --> 18:39.217
are unique to any given area,

18:39.260 --> 18:42.130
crude oil deposits are like
a geographic fingerprint.

18:42.173 --> 18:44.478
This is from outside
Kabul, Afghanistan,

18:44.521 --> 18:46.043
on the Afghan
pipeline.

18:46.086 --> 18:48.695
There was no oil where the girls
were found, so...

18:48.739 --> 18:51.608
So it's probably where they
were being held captive.

18:51.652 --> 18:54.260
And where Lieutenant Flores
still might be.

19:02.695 --> 19:04.695
Commander?

19:05.739 --> 19:07.652
Chaplain Burke? Hello?

19:07.695 --> 19:09.434
Anybody here?

19:10.565 --> 19:12.913
[imitating Paul Newman]:
Anybody here?

19:14.478 --> 19:16.434
Cool Hand Luke.

19:16.478 --> 19:18.043
[chuckles]

19:18.086 --> 19:20.000
Of course, You knew that.

19:21.304 --> 19:23.608
You know, I could have used You
a couple months ago.

19:23.652 --> 19:26.869
Got my head scrambled
pretty good.

19:26.913 --> 19:29.347
Of course, I understand
You're a busy guy.

19:30.391 --> 19:32.521
We haven't talked much.

19:32.565 --> 19:34.739
That's my bad.

19:45.086 --> 19:48.043
I'm doing the best I can
down here, you know.

19:48.086 --> 19:50.043
For a DiNozzo.

19:52.086 --> 19:56.043
Hopefully, living up to my end
of the bargain.

19:57.000 --> 20:01.130
You do remember our bargain...?

20:03.043 --> 20:05.782
Be nice to hear from You.

20:05.826 --> 20:08.043
So You have a plan?

20:08.086 --> 20:11.043
Anything You want
to share with me?

20:12.434 --> 20:16.130
How about You let me know
I'm on the right track?

20:18.391 --> 20:21.782
How about You let me know
I'm not talking to myself?

20:23.217 --> 20:26.434
You are so
predictable.

20:26.478 --> 20:29.043
[with Southern accent]:
Well, I guess what we have here

20:29.086 --> 20:31.739
is a failure to communicate.

20:31.782 --> 20:33.130
Agent DiNozzo.

20:34.260 --> 20:36.000
You looking for me?

20:37.043 --> 20:38.086
Yeah.

20:38.130 --> 20:40.043
[clears throat]
Chaplain.

20:40.086 --> 20:41.565
Tell Joseph Flores

20:41.608 --> 20:43.304
we think we know where
his daughter might be.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.086
I'm getting
out of here.

20:51.043 --> 20:52.956
VANCE:
Extraction team in place.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.652
Zero hour.

20:54.695 --> 20:57.043
That's what
they call it.

20:57.086 --> 21:00.565
I'd like to take this time
to wish everyone luck.

21:00.608 --> 21:03.347
Luck's for the unprepared,
Mr. Secretary.

21:03.391 --> 21:05.608
Well, I'd rather have it
than not, General.

21:07.608 --> 21:09.565
Game on.
Scopes and helmet cams.

21:14.478 --> 21:16.217
Air support's
on standby.

21:17.391 --> 21:19.173
Thermals indicate
five people.

21:19.217 --> 21:21.043
The one on the ground's
probably Flores.

21:21.086 --> 21:22.913
Okay. Let's do this.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.347
[gunfire]

21:31.391 --> 21:32.826
Corpsman!

21:32.869 --> 21:34.869
[heavy gunfire]

21:34.913 --> 21:35.869
Go! Go! Go!

21:35.913 --> 21:37.000
Pressure.

21:40.304 --> 21:41.565
You hang in there, Marine.

21:41.608 --> 21:42.869
[groans]

21:45.086 --> 21:46.478
SOLIDER:
I got him, sir.

21:47.739 --> 21:49.043
Keep breathing, Captain.

21:50.173 --> 21:51.521
Go, go, go!

22:06.043 --> 22:07.304
[speaks Arabic command]

22:15.173 --> 22:16.130
That's her.

22:18.086 --> 22:19.086
GIBBS:
Lieutenant?

22:19.130 --> 22:21.913
Fine, sir.

22:23.608 --> 22:26.043
Your call.

22:26.086 --> 22:28.304
Give me a reason.

22:34.260 --> 22:35.913
So what's it gonna be?

22:35.956 --> 22:37.652
Feed you to the locals,

22:37.695 --> 22:41.913
lifetime at Gitmo,
or you die right here?

23:22.869 --> 23:24.956
SOLIDER:
Target's secure!

23:26.086 --> 23:27.869
Don't you say a word.

23:38.913 --> 23:41.086
Oh, God...

23:41.130 --> 23:42.347
How am I doing?

23:42.391 --> 23:43.913
You're doing great, Captain.
Just hold on.

23:43.956 --> 23:45.913
We're going to need three
more liters of O-neg.

23:45.956 --> 23:47.086
I gotta get him
some lidocaine.

23:47.130 --> 23:48.130
Did anybody call
for medevac?

23:48.173 --> 23:49.826
It's on the way.

23:49.869 --> 23:51.652
Ma'am, I can take it
from here-- step back.

23:54.086 --> 23:55.956
Don't go, David.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.652
I'm not leaving you.

23:58.695 --> 24:00.956
Ma'am, I need you to please--I said I am not leaving!

24:03.434 --> 24:05.173
You look at me, Captain.
Look at me.

24:05.217 --> 24:07.304
That's right.

24:07.347 --> 24:08.826
My mom and dad.

24:08.869 --> 24:11.652
Tell them...

24:11.695 --> 24:13.130
I'm sorry.

24:13.173 --> 24:16.130
Where are they?
What are their names?

24:16.173 --> 24:18.304
Come on. Stay with me.

24:18.347 --> 24:21.130
Maryland.

24:21.173 --> 24:25.217
They own a small motel
on the bay.

24:25.260 --> 24:28.608
You have to tell them...

24:28.652 --> 24:30.695
I love them.

24:30.739 --> 24:33.652
I promise I will.

24:33.695 --> 24:35.217
I promise I will tell
them everything.

24:37.347 --> 24:39.652
[exhales]

24:50.304 --> 24:52.695
We'll get you home.

24:57.521 --> 25:02.130
[helicopter approaching]

25:02.173 --> 25:03.956
Agent DiNozzo...

25:04.000 --> 25:06.260
what is it?

25:10.434 --> 25:12.521
We got her, sir.

25:12.565 --> 25:13.391
[sighs]

25:13.434 --> 25:14.391
Your daughter Gabriela--

25:14.434 --> 25:15.608
she's alive.

25:15.652 --> 25:16.565
[sighs]

25:16.608 --> 25:18.000
Thank you.

25:18.043 --> 25:19.260
God bless you.

25:20.739 --> 25:23.000
She's alive!
She's alive!

25:31.130 --> 25:33.391
Drink.

25:33.434 --> 25:35.913
I have been, sir.

25:35.956 --> 25:39.695
Well, drink some more.

25:39.739 --> 25:41.347
There are some folks happy

25:41.391 --> 25:43.173
to hear you're alive,
Lieutenant.

25:43.217 --> 25:45.260
I know.

25:45.304 --> 25:47.652
Your dad's pretty
happy, too.

25:47.695 --> 25:49.043
I'm anxious to see him.

25:49.086 --> 25:51.695
Yeah, I bet you are.

25:51.739 --> 25:54.173
Quincy, sir...

25:54.217 --> 25:59.000
he wouldn't be dead
if I hadn't...

25:59.043 --> 26:00.347
[voice breaking]:
if I hadn't...

26:00.391 --> 26:04.217
Quincy died doing
his job, Flores.

26:04.260 --> 26:06.913
He was your
commanding officer.

26:06.956 --> 26:09.608
That made you his
responsibility.

26:13.217 --> 26:15.565
Why'd you do it--

26:15.608 --> 26:17.260
running off
with the kids,

26:17.304 --> 26:20.043
disobeying orders.

26:20.086 --> 26:21.304
I didn't have a choice.

26:21.347 --> 26:24.304
I knew what would happen
to those girls.

26:24.347 --> 26:26.695
If I had to do it again...

26:26.739 --> 26:28.173
You would.

26:28.217 --> 26:30.173
Yes, sir.

26:33.869 --> 26:37.565
People died because
of that teacher--

26:37.608 --> 26:39.304
Marines.

26:41.956 --> 26:45.782
What do you think
should happen to her?

26:45.826 --> 26:48.173
Sir, that's not my decision.

26:48.217 --> 26:50.086
Yeah, but you've thought
about it, right?

26:53.130 --> 26:55.913
She should be held
accountable for her crimes.

26:57.347 --> 26:59.000
Oh.

27:04.217 --> 27:07.521
She should watch those girls

27:07.565 --> 27:10.217
change the world in
positive ways

27:10.260 --> 27:12.000
she never imagined.

27:14.043 --> 27:15.695
That a punishment?

27:15.739 --> 27:18.130
That's a gift, sir.

27:18.173 --> 27:21.347
Punishment is knowing she could
have done the same.

27:27.652 --> 27:29.565
You're rare, Flores.

27:30.478 --> 27:32.260
Come on. Let's go home.

27:42.304 --> 27:43.478
What?

27:43.521 --> 27:44.608
Nothing.

27:44.652 --> 27:47.304
Oh, no.
Definitely something. What?

27:47.347 --> 27:49.695
You intrigue me.

27:49.739 --> 27:51.434
Uh-oh.

27:51.478 --> 27:53.956
Why?

27:54.000 --> 27:55.434
When something's broken,
I want to fix it.

27:55.478 --> 27:57.043
Well, I hate to break it
to you, Chaplain,

27:57.086 --> 27:59.130
but you ain't got
enough tools in your woodshed.

27:59.173 --> 28:02.173
Oh, you might be surprised.
[chuckles]

28:05.652 --> 28:07.260
So how do I intrigue you?

28:07.304 --> 28:09.086
In a naughty Catholic
schoolgirl kind of way

28:09.130 --> 28:12.739
or because I'm in need
of what your kind calls
"spiritual guidance"?

28:12.782 --> 28:14.434
Well, lucky for me,
the latter.

28:14.478 --> 28:16.695
Well, you don't have
to worry about me.

28:16.739 --> 28:18.826
I am rock solid
in the spirit department.

28:18.869 --> 28:20.739
Mm, that's fascinating.

28:20.782 --> 28:23.173
You know what's even more
fascinating?

28:23.217 --> 28:25.782
No, what's that?

28:25.826 --> 28:28.043
I don't believe you.

28:28.086 --> 28:31.173
When you're ready to face
that fear, Agent DiNozzo,

28:31.217 --> 28:34.086
I'm ready to face it with you.

28:37.739 --> 28:39.652
[chuckles]

28:53.217 --> 28:55.391
You know, I...

28:55.434 --> 28:57.782
I was just trying to save them.

28:57.826 --> 28:59.391
And you did.

29:01.565 --> 29:03.043
Should've been me in that box.

29:03.086 --> 29:04.391
No, Lieutenant.

29:04.434 --> 29:08.173
And it should not have been
Captain Quincy either.

29:19.913 --> 29:21.913
What's going on?
What's it say?

29:21.956 --> 29:24.000
Helo went down.
Lost six Marines.

29:24.043 --> 29:25.608
Where?

29:25.652 --> 29:27.043
Okinawa, Japan.

29:27.086 --> 29:28.695
Poor bastards
just got there.

29:28.739 --> 29:31.826
I think that Matteson girl was
one of them.

29:31.869 --> 29:33.217
I never actually talked to her,

29:33.260 --> 29:35.130
but she beat three
of my course times.

29:35.173 --> 29:37.826
She was good.
Hell of an athlete.

29:37.869 --> 29:39.434

Matteson.

Welcome to my classroom.

31:15.130 --> 31:17.521
Why am I here?

31:17.565 --> 31:19.086
Instead of a direct flight
to Gitmo,

31:19.130 --> 31:20.608
I thought we could talk.

31:20.652 --> 31:23.130
Have a family reunion.

31:23.173 --> 31:25.521
I have nothing to say.

31:25.565 --> 31:28.173
When was the last time
you saw each other?

31:28.217 --> 31:31.304
No, let me guess.

31:31.347 --> 31:33.652
Terrorist convention in Toledo?

31:33.695 --> 31:36.000
Mock me all you want,
Agent Gibbs,

31:36.043 --> 31:38.565
you will never understand
our motivation.

31:38.608 --> 31:43.043
You gained the trust of these
kids, and then you hurt 'em.

31:43.086 --> 31:46.173
By teaching future generations
not to be influenced

31:46.217 --> 31:48.130
by your histrionic lies?

31:48.173 --> 31:51.739
In this country, teaching
children is a privilege.

31:51.782 --> 31:54.043
In this country,
you waste money

31:54.086 --> 31:56.434
sending your kids
to college to have fun.

31:56.478 --> 31:58.608
They're taught
to think on their own.

31:58.652 --> 32:00.652
They are rich, spoiled brats.

32:00.695 --> 32:02.956
This is how you answer that?

32:03.000 --> 32:07.869
You're radicals who maim and
kill innocent children

32:07.913 --> 32:11.000
because they want to learn how
other people think?!

32:11.043 --> 32:13.739
You think we do this
for ourselves?!

32:13.782 --> 32:16.000
You come into our
villages and towns

32:16.043 --> 32:18.608
with your disgusting
Western ideals.

32:18.652 --> 32:22.521
You teach our children to
question their heritage,

32:22.565 --> 32:25.391
to rely on the Internet
instead of the Koran.

32:25.434 --> 32:29.130
Yes, this is our answer.
It is the only answer.

32:29.173 --> 32:31.608
And you will see.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.173
I'll see.

32:35.869 --> 32:37.217
I'll see what?

32:37.260 --> 32:38.869
You are here.

32:38.913 --> 32:40.173
We are here.

32:40.217 --> 32:42.304
Lieutenant Flores is here.

32:42.347 --> 32:44.304
And our older brother
is here, too.

32:44.347 --> 32:45.173
Asa, don't!

32:47.217 --> 32:50.260
According to our file,
he's dead.

32:51.304 --> 32:53.695
Well...

32:53.739 --> 32:56.217
You think our fight is over.

32:56.260 --> 32:59.217
But...

32:59.260 --> 33:02.304
it has just begun.

33:13.043 --> 33:14.478
Hey, look what the Corps
sent back.

33:18.260 --> 33:19.695
Rough trip, Ziva?

33:19.739 --> 33:22.608
"Rough" is
an understatement, McGee.

33:22.652 --> 33:25.565
Lieutenant Flores is back.

33:25.608 --> 33:28.913
As is Captain Quincy.

33:30.521 --> 33:32.347
And there lies the scratch.

33:32.391 --> 33:33.478
The rub.

33:33.521 --> 33:34.695
"There lies the rub."
It's a classic.

33:34.739 --> 33:36.304
Well, I need some rest.

33:36.347 --> 33:37.913
No rest for the weary, Ziva.

33:40.347 --> 33:42.695

33:42.739 --> 33:44.304
Born in Helmand Province.

33:44.347 --> 33:47.434
Fought with the Mujahideen for
seven years against the Soviets.

33:47.478 --> 33:49.086
Raised to the rank
of commander.

33:49.130 --> 33:51.521

occupiers out of Kabul.

33:52.652 --> 33:53.913
Until he joined the Taliban.

33:53.956 --> 33:55.956
And he brought his brother
and sister with him.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.043

33:59.565 --> 34:01.652
Osman was killed in
an apartment complex raid

34:01.695 --> 34:03.869
in Gardez, Afghanistan,
two years ago.

34:03.913 --> 34:06.173
Raid set off
a gas-line explosion.

34:06.217 --> 34:08.000
Osman was among
two dozen dead.

34:08.043 --> 34:10.086
Not according
to his siblings.

34:10.130 --> 34:11.739

up to something.

If Osman's little brother

34:30.043 --> 34:31.826
had been in D.C.
the whole time...

34:31.869 --> 34:33.478
He might know
where the big brother is.

34:35.173 --> 34:37.043
Did you lose something, Gibbs?

34:37.086 --> 34:38.652
Yeah, a knife.

34:38.695 --> 34:41.043
Well, you always have one
in your pocket, right?

34:41.086 --> 34:43.043
Well, this one's different.

35:32.869 --> 35:34.826

fire regulations, too.

40:24.869 --> 40:26.521
Pass on the vacation.

40:26.565 --> 40:29.043
I am having dinner with
Lieutenant Flores, though.

40:29.086 --> 40:30.695
She's doing great.

40:30.739 --> 40:31.913
Thanks, anyway.

40:31.956 --> 40:34.304
And, Leon...

40:34.347 --> 40:36.826
this is fun.

40:44.695 --> 40:46.739
Do I really
have to do this?

40:46.782 --> 40:48.782
Yes. Just
relax, breathe.

40:48.826 --> 40:50.521
It's hot in here.
[chuckles]:
No, it's not.

40:50.565 --> 40:52.304
I'm sweating.
Maybe I'm having a heart attack.

40:52.347 --> 40:53.434
My left arm is tingling,

40:53.478 --> 40:55.043
and I should go
to the infirmary.

40:55.086 --> 40:57.739
You'd rather go see
a doctor than do this?

40:57.782 --> 40:59.173
My God, D-DiNozzo,
you're shaking.

40:59.217 --> 41:00.173
Of course
I'm shaking.

41:00.217 --> 41:01.391
I'm having a heart attack.

41:01.434 --> 41:03.434
You're terrified.

41:08.217 --> 41:11.826
Very Special Agent Anthony
DiNozzo doesn't get scared.

41:11.869 --> 41:13.521
I've jumped out
of airplanes,

41:13.565 --> 41:15.652
dead-dropped onto
aircraft carriers,

41:15.695 --> 41:16.826
and I've killed
people, sweetheart.

41:16.869 --> 41:18.173
Lots of them.

41:18.217 --> 41:20.434
I've gotten the plague,
kissed a transvestite,

41:20.478 --> 41:22.782
and been tortured by the best
the Middle East has to offer.

41:22.826 --> 41:24.826
And, still, you're shaking.

41:30.086 --> 41:31.652
Okay.

41:33.695 --> 41:36.217
It's time to
face my fears.

41:36.260 --> 41:37.869
How bad can it be?

41:39.652 --> 41:41.652
Bring it on,
Chaplain.

41:58.434 --> 41:59.782
[Tony and Burke laugh]

42:01.304 --> 42:02.521
Oh.

42:02.565 --> 42:03.739
Congratulations,

42:03.782 --> 42:05.347
Agent DiNozzo.

42:05.391 --> 42:07.739
Your greatest fear is now

42:07.782 --> 42:09.869
about to have
a snack of grapes

42:09.913 --> 42:11.217
and cheese crackers.

42:11.260 --> 42:13.086
You want to join them?
