Of course I--

be some way around that.

Well, you could try...

14:53.259 --> 14:58.431
getting someone
to make the wish
for you, I suppose.

Uh, did we open a chain?
Are we the International House

do you want on your pancakes?
Syrups have kinds?

Oh, also, you know,
I was thinking
after the mall yesterday.

15:19.519 --> 15:24.456

 tonight. Maybe we could stay in
 and-- ooh-- ow--

- um, you know,
get a pizza or rent a movie?
- Um--

15:28.028 --> 15:31.965
Also, I didn't know
if you had plans this weekend,
but I thought maybe we could--

Hey, Buffy, I'm gonna be okay
with the basement thing.
Really.

Yes, I am.

15:49.849 --> 15:52.418
I'm the embarrassing mom
who tries too hard.
When did this happen?

15:52.451 --> 15:55.687
No. You're not.
It's not that.

15:55.721 --> 16:01.260
It's just--
What if instead of
you hanging out with me,

16:01.293 --> 16:04.496
maybe I could hang out
with you.

16:04.530 --> 16:07.933
Why don't I come
patrolling with you tonight?
Oh, and then...

16:07.966 --> 16:10.702
maybe we could
invite over some strangers
and ask them to feed you candy.

16:10.736 --> 16:14.006
Well, you guys went out
patrolling every night
when you were my age.

16:14.041 --> 16:18.445
True. But technically,
you're one and a half.

16:18.477 --> 16:21.880
See, I thought
a little levity might--
but, okay-- also no.

16:21.913 --> 16:24.150
I just--
I just think I could help.

16:24.183 --> 16:28.355
I'm sure you could, but
it's a little more dangerous
than I had in mind.

16:28.388 --> 16:32.792
But--
Dawn, I work very hard to
keep you away from that stuff.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.861
I don't want you
around dangerous things
that can kill you.

16:35.894 --> 16:39.899
Which would be a perfectly
reasonable argument
if my sister was chosen...

16:39.932 --> 16:44.303
to protect the world
from tax audits, but, see,
my sister is you,

16:44.336 --> 16:48.207
and dangerous things
that want to kill me
seem to find me.

16:48.240 --> 16:51.543
But you don't need
to go looking for them.

16:51.577 --> 16:55.115
Now eat up.
You're gonna be late
for school.

16:57.950 --> 17:00.419
Okay, wait.
 It was under her wig?

17:00.452 --> 17:03.090
Well, it was this thing.
It just came out from
inside her head.

17:03.123 --> 17:07.394
That's disgusting.
What did it look like?
Let's put it this way.

17:07.425 --> 17:11.431
If I wasn't gay before--
God. And this was
after the invisible ray?

17:11.463 --> 17:14.433
Yeah.
Okay. I'm gone
for a couple of months.

17:14.467 --> 17:18.404
Ooh, did I tell you
about the demon eggs?
See, now I know...

17:18.438 --> 17:20.606
you're just trying
to make me jealous.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.608
What?
No rollicking adventures
in the dorm?

17:23.643 --> 17:26.944
It's not the same.
It's not like living with
a house full of family...

17:26.979 --> 17:29.348
or sharing a room
with someone you--

17:29.382 --> 17:33.119
- Are friends with?
- Hi.

17:33.153 --> 17:35.887
Oh, my God.
You're back.

17:35.922 --> 17:37.957
We've been so worried.
Yeah.

17:37.990 --> 17:41.794
Sorry. I--
I needed to, um,
you know.

17:41.827 --> 17:45.932
I mean,
I couldn't stay here, not after
everything that happened.

17:45.964 --> 17:50.603
- No, no, no.
We totally understand.
- But you're back now, right?

17:50.636 --> 17:55.875
It's complicated.
You know, there's a lot
to deal with.

17:55.907 --> 17:58.545
Well, if there's
anything we can do,
just let us--

17:58.577 --> 18:00.880
Actually, um,

18:00.913 --> 18:04.750
there's an eensy something
I could use a little help with.

18:04.784 --> 18:10.789
You're lesbians, so the hating
of men will come in handy.
Let's talk about Xander.

18:10.823 --> 18:14.426
- He feels awful.
- You think it's anywhere close
to what I feel?

18:14.461 --> 18:18.230
No, but--
What if it were you, Dawn?

18:18.265 --> 18:21.768
What if all
you dreamed about
was that magical day,

18:21.800 --> 18:25.837
the day when the one person
you love with all your soul
would promise to cherish...

18:25.872 --> 18:28.240
and protect your heart
for the rest of his life,
but instead,

18:28.275 --> 18:30.609
he shatters it
into a million jagged pieces.

18:30.643 --> 18:33.512
Well, it's not really
so much about hating the men.

18:33.546 --> 18:38.684
We're more centered around
the girl-on-girl action.

18:38.718 --> 18:42.020
And men really like
to watch that kind of stuff,
don't they?

18:42.054 --> 18:44.156
Men like Xander.

18:44.191 --> 18:47.594
I don't think
he could feel any worse.

18:47.626 --> 18:50.529
Let's test that theory.
Anya,
Xander's my friend.

18:50.563 --> 18:55.367
-I know what he did was wrong,
and if it happened to me, I'd--
-Wish his penis would explode?

18:55.402 --> 18:58.171
I never
use that word anymore.
"Coagulate"?

18:58.204 --> 19:00.373
W-I-S-H.

19:00.406 --> 19:03.710
Oh. "Wish."
As in, "I wish Xander--"
Right. That word.

19:03.742 --> 19:07.814
There is vengeance demons
out there that are still active,
remember?

19:07.846 --> 19:12.384
Any "I wish" can totally
end in horrible grossness.
Give me a for instance.

19:12.419 --> 19:16.556
- I don't really think I should.
- Did I mention the whole
"left at the altar" thing?

19:16.588 --> 19:20.125
Didn't leave that out,
did I?
No. No.

19:20.159 --> 19:24.864
Look. I know
what he did was wrong.
God, if it happened to me, I--

19:24.896 --> 19:29.836
It must have been torture.
Okay. Let's talk about torture.

19:29.868 --> 19:33.573
So, tell me more about
wishing Xander's brains and guts
would go blooey.

19:33.605 --> 19:36.476
I didn't say that.
Yes, you did.
I heard you.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.877
I swear I didn't say that.
Didn't say what?

19:38.911 --> 19:43.915
Um, I just saw you were back
and wanted to talk to you
about working off my debt.

19:43.950 --> 19:47.586
You know,
my whole sticky fingers,
grabby hands thing.

19:47.619 --> 19:51.657
Oh, right.
The mad thieving. Good. Yes.
There's much to do.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.661
Gonna put you to work,
missy.

19:54.693 --> 19:57.028
So back
to Xander's brains and guts.

19:57.063 --> 20:02.269
Squish, squish, squish.
Guys have been running roughshod
over you for years,

20:02.301 --> 20:04.270
torturing that perky
 little ticker.

20:04.304 --> 20:08.441
-Aren't you sick of it?
Don't you wish guys like that--
-Whoa. Guys?

20:08.474 --> 20:11.176
There've only been four--
uh, three-- three-- three guys.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.112
I mean,
that's barely plural.

20:13.144 --> 20:17.450
Didn't each of them
rip your heart out?
Don't men like that--

20:17.483 --> 20:21.019
as to pick an example-- Xander--
deserve to be punished?

20:21.053 --> 20:25.525
Well, Xander is a guy,
so it's kind of not
the surprise...

20:25.557 --> 20:27.960
that he likes
to watch girls.

20:27.993 --> 20:30.797
- Why are we talking about this?
- We're comforting me.

20:30.829 --> 20:35.968
Well, I guess it's natural
for guys to be interested in--

20:36.001 --> 20:41.941
God, what kind of lesbians are
you? If you love men so much,
go love men!

20:41.973 --> 20:44.443
Anya, I know
you're hurting, but--
What?

20:44.477 --> 20:48.548
Xander doesn't deserve to suffer
for what he did, 'cause he's
your friend and I'm not, right?

20:48.580 --> 20:52.050
No. That's not
what I'm saying at all.

20:52.084 --> 20:56.323
- What he did was wrong.
He knows that.
- It's just, it hurts.

20:56.355 --> 20:59.326
He hurt me so much.

20:59.358 --> 21:03.630
- He really did.
Look. I wish that--
- Anya?

21:06.598 --> 21:11.170
Well, congratulations.
They all still love you,
even after what you did to me.

21:11.202 --> 21:14.006
- Anya, wait.
- [ Buffy ] Okay, okay.
Not crazy about that idea.

21:14.039 --> 21:16.643
What?
I have to go after her.
Or, in the land of the sane,

21:16.675 --> 21:19.010
you could give her some space,
let her cool down.

21:19.045 --> 21:21.180
That's not proactive guy.

21:21.212 --> 21:25.151
That's "sit around and watch
the rest of your life
turn to crap" guy.

21:25.183 --> 21:29.521
True, but at least crap guy
gets to keep all
of his appendages.

21:29.556 --> 21:33.125
And I'm supposed to what?
Walk away?

21:33.159 --> 21:37.997
Shouldn't be too hard.
 It's what I'm good at, right?

21:38.029 --> 21:40.633
Okay. See? That's exactly
 why a heart-to-heart

21:40.666 --> 21:43.269
is probably not your best
 course of action now.

21:43.301 --> 21:48.106
You're both angry and upset
 and-- What the hell is that
 creepy thing doing in my yard?

21:48.140 --> 21:50.477
Did Willow put that there
 when I was dead,
 'cause if I'd have known,

21:50.509 --> 21:53.045
I would've crawled
out of the grave sooner.

21:53.078 --> 21:55.714
Buffy.
Oh, my God.

21:55.748 --> 21:58.550
Looks like someone's
been keeping an eye
on all your ins and outs.

21:58.585 --> 22:02.388
What the who?
Well, now. Let's see.

22:02.422 --> 22:07.326
Who's obsessed with Buffy? Who
likes to hang out in her yard
and keep an eye on her?

22:07.359 --> 22:09.996
Who's in love with you
and not getting any?

22:11.830 --> 22:14.567
What's this?
It's a camera.

22:14.601 --> 22:17.336
Yeah. I got that part.
Why am I holding it?

22:17.369 --> 22:21.907
Someone was using it
to spy on me. On my house.

22:21.941 --> 22:26.077
Xander thinks it's you.
Oh, the great Xander
thinks so?

22:26.112 --> 22:29.415
Shudder. Gasp.
It must be true.

22:29.449 --> 22:32.919
Spike.
That ponce has always
had it for me.

22:32.951 --> 22:35.855
Every chance he gets,
he sticks it to--

22:35.887 --> 22:41.493
You believe him, don't you?
You think I was spying on you?

22:41.528 --> 22:46.865
You think I could do that?
Because you don't lie or cheat
or steal or manipulate.

22:47.967 --> 22:50.236
I don't hurt you.

22:54.641 --> 22:58.611
I know.
No, you don't.

22:58.644 --> 23:03.450
I've tried
to make it clear to you,
but you won't see it.

23:03.482 --> 23:07.118
Something happened to me,

23:07.153 --> 23:10.122
the way I feel about you.

23:10.155 --> 23:14.794
It's different. And no matter
how hard you try to convince
yourself it isn't,

23:14.826 --> 23:17.262
it's real.

23:17.296 --> 23:20.098
I think it is.

23:21.333 --> 23:23.670
For you.

23:29.608 --> 23:32.979
I know that's not
what you wanna hear.

23:33.011 --> 23:37.282
I'm sorry. I really am,

23:37.316 --> 23:39.951
but, Spike,
you have to move on.

23:39.986 --> 23:43.088
- Okay? You have to get over--
- Get out.

23:55.501 --> 23:58.671
No. They're all,
"Oh, poor Xander.

23:58.704 --> 24:01.641
It took so much
out of him, all that
running away he did."

24:01.673 --> 24:03.976
I just don't understand
what's wrong
with these people.

24:04.009 --> 24:07.179
Did you really think
they were the ones who
would help you?

24:07.212 --> 24:11.017
Well, but--
Do you want retribution,
Anyanka?

24:12.519 --> 24:16.955
I want Xander good and cursed.
Then you know
what you have to do.

24:16.989 --> 24:20.826
Get a wish from someone who
doesn't freaking love him.
Exactly.

24:20.859 --> 24:23.695
But my social circle
is a little limited here.

24:23.730 --> 24:27.599
What am I supposed to do,
just stumble upon someone
who doesn't give a fig's ass...

24:27.634 --> 24:31.037
- if Xander gets hurt?
- [ Door Opening ]

24:31.069 --> 24:35.207
Hey. I need a thing.

24:43.414 --> 24:48.487
- So, what's your pleasure?
- Fresh out of pleasure.
That's why I'm here.

24:48.520 --> 24:51.190
I need something.
Numbing spell maybe.

24:51.222 --> 24:53.358
Uh-huh. Hang on.

24:57.596 --> 25:01.032
Oh, my God.
Spike hates Xander.

25:01.067 --> 25:05.538
Maybe I could get him
to wish-- Damn it.
If only he were a woman.

25:05.571 --> 25:08.575
Got it.
If I can somehow...

25:08.607 --> 25:12.077
get someone to wish
that Spike were a woman,
then I could go to him.

25:12.111 --> 25:15.314
Well, he'd be a her
by then, but then I could
go to her and--

25:15.346 --> 25:19.085
Anyanka, there's an easier way.
I know you have this whole
female power,

25:19.117 --> 25:21.319
take back the night thing,
and I think that's cute.

25:21.353 --> 25:25.124
But I've been telling you
for decades, men need a little
vengeance now and then too.

25:26.759 --> 25:30.630
Oh.
Maybe this is a good chance
to try that out.

25:32.097 --> 25:35.867
Good luck with that.
 Ta-ta.

25:38.871 --> 25:42.709
Sorry to bust up
the little girls' night out.

25:42.741 --> 25:45.912
That's okay. I'm ready
to do some business.

25:45.944 --> 25:49.147
All right then. You
got something that'll
dull the ache a bit?

25:50.316 --> 25:53.019
Actually, yes. Um,

25:53.051 --> 25:57.957
Giles left a couple
of supplies here that
I think just might help.

25:57.990 --> 26:01.794
Eases the hurt.
Makes the sun shine
a little brighter.

26:01.827 --> 26:05.096
Even makes boring people
seem more interesting.

26:05.131 --> 26:09.335
Ah. Here.

26:13.806 --> 26:16.442
[ High Frequency Tone ]

26:16.474 --> 26:19.545
[ Sighs ] How's it coming?
Can you see who's getting
the camera signal?

26:19.577 --> 26:23.582
Should have something
once I get tapped into
the fiber-optic network.

26:23.615 --> 26:29.454
We're gonna use
the feedback relay to get their
signal routed into our system.

26:29.488 --> 26:33.125
Okay, if it's not Spike,
and I'm not saying
I believe him--

26:33.159 --> 26:36.762
But if it's not Spike,
I think we already know
who's behind this.

26:36.796 --> 26:38.897
Makes sense.

26:38.931 --> 26:42.801
I want...
to find... these guys.

26:59.719 --> 27:02.054
Uncover.

27:04.323 --> 27:07.192
There. That's it.
That's where we have to go.

27:07.226 --> 27:10.362
Well, now that we've found out
where we're supposed to go--

27:10.395 --> 27:12.230
- [ Yelling ]
- [ Yelling ]

27:15.300 --> 27:20.940
[ Exhales ]
So then this girl says,
"Real for you."

27:20.972 --> 27:24.042
Right. But
getting back to Xander--

27:24.076 --> 27:27.212
Xander. Let's not
waste any more breath
on that wanker.

27:27.246 --> 27:31.349
But he made a fool of me,
and nobody seems to care enough
to do anything.

27:31.383 --> 27:35.054
I care.
What he done to you?

27:35.086 --> 27:40.358
[ Scoffs ]
I've never stooped that low,
and I'm an evil, soulless thing,

27:40.392 --> 27:42.560
according to some people.

27:42.594 --> 27:47.232
Shouldn't he pay?
Don't you wish he had to pay
in some horrible way?

27:47.266 --> 27:50.001
Absolutely.

27:50.036 --> 27:54.973
Take him on myself,
if it wasn't for
my little handicap.

27:55.007 --> 27:58.644
Right. So,
hypothetically,

27:58.676 --> 28:01.247
what do you wish
you could do to him?

28:01.279 --> 28:05.917
You name it, pet.
You're the wronged party.

28:05.951 --> 28:09.121
Something... gruesome,
I'll bet.

28:14.926 --> 28:18.765
- [ Panting ]
- That's my blanket!

28:18.798 --> 28:21.267
It makes sense.
It was your fire.

Hey, hey. I think
I've got something.
[ Computer Beeps ]

28:25.104 --> 28:27.940
The thing about it is
none of this was my idea.

28:27.973 --> 28:32.443
I didn't ask to be human.
Right. And I didn't ask for
this bloody chip in my head.

28:32.478 --> 28:37.849
To tell you the truth,
all I wanted was to use him
and lose him.

28:37.884 --> 28:43.189
- I hadn't had a good tumble
in a thousand years.
- Me too. The using part.

28:43.221 --> 28:45.624

Never. I was always

That was a virtue.

He thought I was rude.
