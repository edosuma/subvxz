white outfits or something.

she's not that far away.

01:07:23.707 --> 01:07:25.417
Desiree.

01:07:27.128 --> 01:07:29.171
My God.

01:07:31.756 --> 01:07:35.427
Oh, my God, I can't
believe it's you.

01:07:35.427 --> 01:07:38.388
I can't believe
it's you.

01:07:38.388 --> 01:07:41.057
You look absolutely
the same.

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:45.146
Well, almost, right?
But you do.

01:07:45.146 --> 01:07:47.148
I mean, you haven't
changed your hair.

01:07:47.148 --> 01:07:48.149
I always--

01:07:48.149 --> 01:07:49.275
I know, you love
this haircut.

01:07:49.275 --> 01:07:50.859
Yeah.
I remember.

01:07:50.859 --> 01:07:52.861
I remember.
How are you, Zia?

01:07:52.861 --> 01:07:54.362
I'm good.

01:07:54.362 --> 01:07:56.531
Can we deal with
the dog business here?

01:07:56.531 --> 01:07:58.992
All right, let's
deal with the dog.

01:07:58.992 --> 01:08:02.662
We are going to deal
with the dog.

01:08:05.582 --> 01:08:07.459
Don't do that.
You're confusing the dog.

01:08:07.459 --> 01:08:09.544
What's your name,
Honeysuckle?

01:08:09.544 --> 01:08:11.172
Come on, Freddy.
Come on.

01:08:11.172 --> 01:08:13.131
Treat. Treat.

01:08:13.131 --> 01:08:16.135
[growls]

01:08:16.135 --> 01:08:17.761
The dog has spoken.

01:08:17.761 --> 01:08:20.889
I'm tired, and I need
to concentrate.

01:08:20.889 --> 01:08:22.474
I'll see you
at the ceremony.

01:08:22.474 --> 01:08:25.227
It's gonna be
a hell of a show.

01:08:27.479 --> 01:08:29.314
And then,
after you offed,

01:08:29.314 --> 01:08:32.609
I just cried and cried.

01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:34.861
And I had to leave town

01:08:34.861 --> 01:08:37.072
because everything
reminded me of you.

01:08:39.158 --> 01:08:43.662
Trust me. I never knew
how much I hurt you

01:08:43.662 --> 01:08:45.580
until you were gone.

01:08:47.541 --> 01:08:50.961
Oh, thank God.

01:08:50.961 --> 01:08:55.924
Thank God I can finally
ask you to forgive me.

01:08:55.924 --> 01:08:59.051
[sigh]
Zia.

01:08:59.051 --> 01:09:01.720
King. King?

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:04.640
He was a real friend.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:07.269
He got me out of town,
and I started to get

01:09:07.269 --> 01:09:10.231
more and more
into his teachings,

01:09:10.231 --> 01:09:11.982
and I just stopped crying.

01:09:11.982 --> 01:09:16.111
So then King was
supposed to separate
his body from his soul

01:09:16.111 --> 01:09:17.862
so he could discover
the other, better world

01:09:17.862 --> 01:09:20.991
and come back
and show everyone the way.

01:09:20.991 --> 01:09:23.993
'Cause you know he believes

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:28.832
we're all trapped
in the world of the living.

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:33.461
But something went
terribly wrong,

01:09:33.461 --> 01:09:36.840
and his soul
never made it back.

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:39.676
So at the hospital,

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:43.264
when they confirmed
his death...

01:09:43.264 --> 01:09:45.390
I heard his soul calling me,

01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:48.435
and I just knew--
I knew I had to be with him.

01:09:48.435 --> 01:09:52.188
So I took the elevator

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:56.026
to the hospital roof...

01:09:58.778 --> 01:10:00.739
and flew.

01:10:04.909 --> 01:10:06.870

01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:09.080

01:10:10.291 --> 01:10:11.292
Oh.

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:16.087
Oh, God, time flies
with you, Zia.

01:10:16.087 --> 01:10:18.340
Let's go.
King's about to begin.

01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:21.427
And this time, I know...

01:10:21.427 --> 01:10:23.345
He's gonna make it.

01:10:23.345 --> 01:10:27.098
Come on. I have to
help King prepare.

01:10:32.187 --> 01:10:33.813
[microphone feedback]

01:10:41.404 --> 01:10:42.781
You two made up, huh?

01:10:42.781 --> 01:10:46.117
Well, I forgive,
but I don't forget.

01:10:47.535 --> 01:10:50.372
What keeps
happening to Yan?

01:10:50.372 --> 01:10:52.207
Have you seen Mikal?

01:10:52.207 --> 01:10:54.376
Last time I saw her,
she was talking to
the big guy up there

01:10:54.376 --> 01:10:56.127
about, you know,
going home

01:10:56.127 --> 01:10:58.463
and people in charge
and the usual.

01:10:58.463 --> 01:11:00.340
Right.
What'd he tell her?

01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:04.594
He said,
"I'm taking you all
to a better place."

01:11:04.594 --> 01:11:05.887
Asshole.

01:11:05.887 --> 01:11:09.057
[feedback, drum roll]

01:11:26.574 --> 01:11:29.370
Don't be alarmed, friends.

01:11:31.497 --> 01:11:34.708
The vessel will die soon,

01:11:34.708 --> 01:11:38.379
and the spirit will rise.

01:11:38.379 --> 01:11:42.006
The first time
was only a test...

01:11:42.006 --> 01:11:46.219
a precursor
to the real thing.

01:11:46.219 --> 01:11:47.679
Why don't you just tell her?

01:11:47.679 --> 01:11:49.347
Tell her what?

01:11:49.347 --> 01:11:51.516
Tell her that you love her.

01:11:51.516 --> 01:11:54.185
[King]
Don't be afraid when I leave.

01:11:54.185 --> 01:11:56.855
You do, don't you?

01:11:56.855 --> 01:11:58.857
For I will be back
to save you all.

01:11:58.857 --> 01:12:00.567
It's too far.
She won't hear.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.823
[drum roll]

01:12:15.707 --> 01:12:19.127
What is he doing?

01:12:23.465 --> 01:12:25.341
He's bluffing.

01:12:26.384 --> 01:12:28.219
Nobody would do that twice.

01:12:28.219 --> 01:12:30.263
You know how much that hurts.

01:12:30.263 --> 01:12:31.264
Yeah.

01:12:33.433 --> 01:12:36.395

01:13:00.251 --> 01:13:02.754
We're at the compound.
I need backup.

01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:08.594
Come right now.
This guy's gone crazy.

01:13:16.935 --> 01:13:19.312
Everyone, look!
There he is!

He's coming.
He's coming.

01:13:22.607 --> 01:13:24.651
They're-- They're coming.

01:13:27.488 --> 01:13:29.280
Kneller.

01:13:31.533 --> 01:13:35.286
Blessings. Blessings.
He's gonna show us the way.

01:13:35.286 --> 01:13:38.790
Everyone, keep your hands
lifted up to King.

01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:40.501
See us for bruises!
Go home!

01:14:00.687 --> 01:14:02.355
Please disperse.

Yan.
What the fuck
is going on?

01:14:03.731 --> 01:14:05.526
I don't know.
Have you seen Mikal?

01:14:05.526 --> 01:14:08.152
She was right here
a second ago.

01:14:08.152 --> 01:14:10.071
Please disperse.
This is the People In Charge.

Where's Kneller?

01:14:11.281 --> 01:14:13.074
I don't know.
I'll be right back.

01:14:13.074 --> 01:14:17.078
This is the P.I.C.:
the People In Charge.

01:14:17.078 --> 01:14:19.706

in five minutes.

Please leave immediately.

What are you guys
doing here?

01:15:25.730 --> 01:15:27.649
Came to pick you up, man.

01:15:27.649 --> 01:15:29.275
Yan tell you
what happened?

01:15:29.275 --> 01:15:30.860
Kneller did.

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:32.946
Is Mikal with him?

01:15:32.946 --> 01:15:35.531
No.

01:15:35.531 --> 01:15:36.616
Did he mention
anything about her?

01:15:36.616 --> 01:15:39.620
Not to me. Jump in.

01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:41.579
I can't.
I gotta stay here
and wait for her.

01:15:43.706 --> 01:15:45.416
How long you gonna wait, man?

01:15:45.416 --> 01:15:47.711
She's an adult.
She'll find her way back.

01:15:48.754 --> 01:15:50.171
[dog barks]

01:15:55.051 --> 01:15:56.552
What's Freddy doing here?

01:15:56.552 --> 01:15:59.765
Get in, dickhead.
We have a train to make.

01:16:01.933 --> 01:16:02.934
Train?

01:16:02.934 --> 01:16:04.644
Get in.

01:16:21.786 --> 01:16:24.455
So Kneller never
actually did
kill himself.

01:16:24.455 --> 01:16:25.957
No, of course not.

01:16:25.957 --> 01:16:27.792
He was working for
the People In Charge.

01:16:27.792 --> 01:16:30.837
Undercover.

01:16:30.837 --> 01:16:34.257
I always had a feeling
he was an angel
or something.

01:16:34.257 --> 01:16:36.592
An angel? Come on.

01:16:36.592 --> 01:16:37.802
Well...

01:16:37.802 --> 01:16:39.804
So now that he blew his cover,

01:16:39.804 --> 01:16:43.808
he'll be transferred
out of the undercover unit.

01:16:43.808 --> 01:16:45.601
Transferred?
Where's he going?

01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:48.146
Don't know.
Wherever the People
In Charge operate.

01:16:49.981 --> 01:16:51.774
Looks like that's it.

01:17:03.787 --> 01:17:06.372
So camp is totally over?

01:17:06.372 --> 01:17:08.541
Yup.

01:17:08.541 --> 01:17:13.629
Turns out Kneller ran it
completely illegally.

01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:17.175
And on the P.I.C. property,
no less.

01:17:18.968 --> 01:17:23.139
So what are you
gonna do?

01:17:24.348 --> 01:17:25.767
I don't know.

01:17:25.767 --> 01:17:26.851
I'm definitely gonna
go back to camp

01:17:26.851 --> 01:17:28.311
and wait for Mikal,

01:17:28.311 --> 01:17:31.647
but after that,
I guess I'll see.

01:17:33.858 --> 01:17:36.319
You'll see?

01:17:38.446 --> 01:17:41.657
What?

01:17:41.657 --> 01:17:44.452
Listen.

01:17:44.452 --> 01:17:47.580
I didn't want
to tell you this.

01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:51.877
According to Kneller,
in the middle of that
whole Messiah hassle,

01:17:51.877 --> 01:17:55.881
Mikal talked to one of
those P.I.C. guys and--

01:17:55.881 --> 01:17:57.673
and asked him
to check her file.

01:17:57.673 --> 01:17:59.885
And I know it sounds crazy,

01:17:59.885 --> 01:18:02.887
but it turns out
there really was
some kind of mistake,

01:18:02.887 --> 01:18:05.891
and it looks like they'll
be sending her back--

01:18:05.891 --> 01:18:07.600
back to life.

01:18:19.821 --> 01:18:21.114
It's a good thing,
you know?

01:18:21.114 --> 01:18:22.782
'Cause she gets to go back.

01:18:22.782 --> 01:18:24.700
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:18:25.701 --> 01:18:26.911
It is.

01:18:26.911 --> 01:18:29.872
I mean, it's what
she wanted, so...

01:18:35.044 --> 01:18:37.421
Take care.

01:18:39.757 --> 01:18:41.927
[blows whistle]

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:46.848
Bye, Nanuk.

01:18:59.903 --> 01:19:01.154
Come here.

01:19:05.784 --> 01:19:07.410
See you, man.

01:19:16.919 --> 01:19:22.133
Hey, don't forget to give
that package to my folks.

01:19:37.899 --> 01:19:39.358
They went to the North Pole

01:19:39.358 --> 01:19:42.653
or whatever the place
Nanuk is from is called.

01:19:42.653 --> 01:19:44.197
He wanted
to meet her family

01:19:44.197 --> 01:19:46.157
and get into
that throat singing,

01:19:46.157 --> 01:19:49.869
saw playing,
weird instruments,
and all that stuff.

01:19:49.869 --> 01:19:53.289
It's good that he's back
into music, I think.

01:20:57.020 --> 01:20:59.230
And me?

01:20:59.230 --> 01:21:00.940
I think I finally understand

01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:04.110
what Kneller
was trying to say.

01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:07.405
It only happens
if it doesn't matter.

01:21:08.823 --> 01:21:10.825
It comes without effort.

01:21:14.079 --> 01:21:16.956
Maybe Eugene's right.

01:21:16.956 --> 01:21:19.375
Maybe I only
get stuck on girls

01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:21.836
I don't have a chance
of being with.

01:21:23.046 --> 01:21:25.840
I am glad for Mikal, though.

01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:28.217
I hope she got her visa
all straightened out.

01:21:31.595 --> 01:21:34.890
I mean, she did say
she'd be right back.

01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:39.312
Then again,
Eugene's old wisdom is
when a girl says that,

01:21:39.312 --> 01:21:42.065
she never does
actually come back.

01:21:44.025 --> 01:21:48.029
So I don't know.
Go figure it out.
