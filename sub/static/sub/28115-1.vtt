14:18.640 --> 14:20.160
[inhales, exhales]

14:20.200 --> 14:21.600
It's good to see you.

14:21.640 --> 14:25.280
I got in as close as we could.

14:25.320 --> 14:27.760
Any closer and it just becomes
a horrible mess.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.120
It could be anyone.

14:32.160 --> 14:34.320
But he was wearing an orange cap
the day he left.

14:34.360 --> 14:36.560
We just need to find a different
angle, then you'll see.

14:36.600 --> 14:38.040
The camera crew didn't have
another angle.

14:38.080 --> 14:39.960
That's all we have.

14:48.120 --> 14:51.320
So, how are things out there

14:51.360 --> 14:53.080
in the middle of nowhere?

14:53.120 --> 14:55.520
Quiet.

14:55.560 --> 14:57.280
I'm sorry I never went there.

14:57.320 --> 15:00.760
Your father did ask me
enough times.

15:00.800 --> 15:04.360
I need your help, Martin.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.000
No one's gonna listen to me.

15:06.040 --> 15:08.400
They'll listen to you.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.440
Did he ever tell you
about Indonesia?

15:10.480 --> 15:11.920
I didn't come here
to talk about Dad.

15:11.960 --> 15:13.320
No, I know.

15:13.360 --> 15:16.320
His first patrol,
his helicopter went down.

15:16.360 --> 15:18.280
He was the only one
to walk out alive.

15:18.320 --> 15:22.360
20 years later,
he was still having nightmares.

15:22.400 --> 15:24.200
These things follow us, Georgia.

15:24.240 --> 15:26.440
Clinging on to them
is no good for you.

15:26.480 --> 15:29.720
How would you know
what's good for me?

15:29.760 --> 15:32.520
I know you're still angry
about what happened,

15:32.560 --> 15:34.400
but you mustn't think
I don't care about you.

15:34.440 --> 15:36.280
Well, you've had an odd way
of showing it.

15:36.320 --> 15:39.240
Now, there are other ways.

15:39.280 --> 15:42.280
My life now,
you wouldn't recognize me.

15:42.320 --> 15:43.280
I see friends,

15:43.320 --> 15:45.560
have lunch, play boules.

15:45.600 --> 15:48.280
I'm the one people are supposed
to be worried about?

15:48.320 --> 15:51.520
[sneezes] Bloody hay fever.

15:51.560 --> 15:53.800
It isn't him. It can't be.
He died on that plane.

15:53.840 --> 15:55.400
He was checked in,

15:55.440 --> 15:57.960
-counted on.
-They never found
his body, ever.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.680
Well, him and a lot
of other people.

15:59.720 --> 16:01.280
You have to think
about yourself.

16:01.320 --> 16:04.320
-I am. This is what I'm doing.
-No, you're not.

16:04.360 --> 16:07.120
You're trying to climb K2
in a thunderstorm

16:07.160 --> 16:09.760
because that's who you are.

16:09.800 --> 16:13.040
You don't really
play boules, do you?

16:13.080 --> 16:15.320
People change.

16:15.360 --> 16:17.400
No. Not as much

16:17.440 --> 16:20.400
as you'd like to think.

16:20.440 --> 16:22.720
Georgia, you really need
to forget about all of this.

16:22.760 --> 16:26.080
I should never have come here
asking for help from you.

16:26.120 --> 16:28.160
-Georgia!
-This was a mistake. Forget it.

16:30.200 --> 16:33.920
Georgia, where are you going?

16:33.960 --> 16:36.320
-[door slams shut]
-[sighs]

16:51.840 --> 16:53.680
-Miss Wells?
-Yeah.

16:53.720 --> 16:55.920
-Come-come this way.
-Has there been any news?

16:55.960 --> 16:58.000
Is the plane still missing?

16:58.040 --> 17:00.000
I've been trying to get online
since I landed.

17:00.040 --> 17:02.640
My English is not good. Please.

17:05.920 --> 17:08.280
JUDITH [on phone]:
This is Judith. Leave a message.

17:08.320 --> 17:11.440
Judith, I've just landed.
I can't get online here.

17:11.480 --> 17:14.640
No one's told me anything.
If you've got any news, call me.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.800
-[man speaking French on TV]

17:41.240 --> 17:43.240

18:00.640 --> 18:03.000
-Miss?
-Oh, Christ.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.320
-Miss, are you okay?
-It crashed?

18:05.360 --> 18:08.600
They found the wreckage
an hour ago.

18:08.640 --> 18:11.680
My brother was on the plane.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.640
My husband.

18:16.680 --> 18:19.080
I can't look anymore.

18:23.920 --> 18:25.280
[people clamoring]

18:39.520 --> 18:41.400
[man speaking French]

18:50.800 --> 18:52.800
-What's he saying?
-I don't know.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.840
He is the minister
for transport.

18:54.880 --> 18:56.880
He says...

18:56.920 --> 18:59.200
all emergency services are
at the wreck site.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.240
The plane crashed in the jungle,

19:02.280 --> 19:04.440
so progress is slow.

19:04.480 --> 19:06.880
They have started searching

19:06.920 --> 19:08.880
for survivors.

19:10.280 --> 19:12.080
None so far.

19:16.440 --> 19:20.000
No information yet on the cause.

19:20.040 --> 19:24.840
This is a terrible disaster

19:24.880 --> 19:26.920
made worse...

19:29.200 --> 19:31.360
-Pathetic.
-What?

19:31.400 --> 19:32.680
There was a politician
on the plane,

19:32.720 --> 19:35.640
Dikembe Rahema, a bitter rival
to this government.

19:35.680 --> 19:37.720
Yet he talks about him
as if he was a saint.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.520
Campaigning for reelection

19:39.560 --> 19:41.080
while my wife is...

19:41.120 --> 19:43.400
My wife was on that plane!

19:43.440 --> 19:45.720
We've had enough!

19:50.880 --> 19:53.280
[clamoring]

19:57.000 --> 19:58.960
Emmanuel Kazadi.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.240
Hennie Botha.

20:01.280 --> 20:04.040
But he talked about survivors.
How could anybody

20:04.080 --> 20:06.200
survive that?

20:34.040 --> 20:35.360
Luggage.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.440
I help.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.000
No, no, no. It's okay.

20:38.040 --> 20:39.560
-This way, we go this way.
-I'm okay.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.000
-This way.
-No.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.560
We go this way.

20:42.600 --> 20:43.880
One dollar only.

20:52.440 --> 20:53.920
Wait!

21:06.840 --> 21:09.080
[sighs]:
Oh, fuck.

21:19.440 --> 21:21.280
[chuckles]

21:21.320 --> 21:24.680
-Hey.
-Hi.

21:24.720 --> 21:26.760
I thought I told you
not to bother meeting me.

21:26.800 --> 21:29.160
And I ignored you.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.760
Where's the rest
of your luggage?

21:30.800 --> 21:32.360
Did some parasite

21:32.400 --> 21:34.280
offer to help with the bag? Huh?

21:34.320 --> 21:36.320
I... Look, it doesn't matter.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.000
Really.

21:38.040 --> 21:41.600
Okay. This way.

21:41.640 --> 21:43.760
GEORGIA:
Thanks for coming.

21:43.800 --> 21:46.120
-It's good to see you, Emmanuel.
-And you.

21:46.160 --> 21:47.800
It's been a long time.

21:49.560 --> 21:52.200
So, show me.

21:57.200 --> 21:59.440
If it is your husband, why now?

21:59.480 --> 22:01.000
After all this time?

22:01.040 --> 22:02.680
I mean, that's what
I'm here to find out.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.160
The paper I worked for
refused to cover this,

22:07.200 --> 22:08.800
but many other journalists

22:08.840 --> 22:10.280
covered the riots.

22:10.320 --> 22:12.280
How many other pictures
were taken?

22:12.320 --> 22:14.760
Hmm? I could make some calls.

22:14.800 --> 22:17.760
Yes. Yes, thank you.

22:18.920 --> 22:21.280
Do you think I'm crazy?

22:21.320 --> 22:25.320
I think...
you miss your husband.

22:27.840 --> 22:31.080
And I know all too well
how that feels.

22:32.080 --> 22:34.080
[engine starts]

22:46.520 --> 22:49.240
[indistinct chatter]

23:13.320 --> 23:16.600
I'm... sorry I didn't make it.

23:16.640 --> 23:18.880
Not at all.

23:18.920 --> 23:20.520
It was so nice of you
to invite me.

23:20.560 --> 23:22.160
It just... it would have been...

23:22.200 --> 23:23.720
You know.

23:23.760 --> 23:26.080
How was it?

23:26.120 --> 23:29.200
Like any wedding. Expensive.

23:29.240 --> 23:32.640
She looked beautiful
in the pictures you sent me.

23:32.680 --> 23:35.680
Yeah, she is.

23:35.720 --> 23:38.320
I'm happy for you.

23:47.840 --> 23:49.440
GEORGIA:
Call me if I can help

23:49.480 --> 23:51.360
or look through any
of the photos you find.

23:51.400 --> 23:52.520

Of course.

23:52.560 --> 23:53.800

-I'll call you later.

24:11.480 --> 24:13.280
Judith, hi.

24:13.320 --> 24:15.440
Hello, Georgia.

24:15.480 --> 24:18.000
-How was your journey?
-Yeah, fine.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.360
I wish you'd let me
come get you.

24:19.400 --> 24:20.760
No, it was okay.
A-A friend dropped me off.

24:20.800 --> 24:21.880
You've done more than enough

24:21.920 --> 24:23.880
offering to let me
stay here, so...

24:23.920 --> 24:26.040
Well, I really didn't give you
much choice, did I?

24:26.080 --> 24:28.240
Please, come on in.

24:34.120 --> 24:36.800
Uh, I hope this is all right.

24:36.840 --> 24:39.120
Oh, it's great.
Thank you.

24:39.160 --> 24:40.960
Sorry, there's a bit
of a crisis at work.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.800
Can I leave you to get settled?
I'll be back soon.

27:10.200 --> 27:11.800

the Ituri provincial governor.

What, you think his people can't
get clean water

27:14.360 --> 27:16.120

of red tape?

-[exhales sharply]

break the deadlock.

That'd be great.

27:23.520 --> 27:26.160
How's your guest?

27:26.200 --> 27:29.320
Well, she's convinced that Will
is somehow still alive.

27:29.360 --> 27:31.600
Well, that doesn't make
any sense.

27:31.640 --> 27:35.360
She thinks this boy
faked his death? Why?

27:37.120 --> 27:41.040
I guess he did have reason
to disappear.

know about.

or twice too many.

30:32.840 --> 30:36.560
Oh, dear. Uh...

30:42.800 --> 30:44.480
So, how did you end up here?

30:44.520 --> 30:45.760
My dad's work.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.480
We came when I was 15,

30:47.520 --> 30:49.320
and we never left.

30:49.360 --> 30:50.560
I like it, though.

30:50.600 --> 30:52.720
I like standing out

to the ships coming in.

44:51.360 --> 44:53.680
To express myself in this way--

44:53.720 --> 44:56.800
it comes at a price,
you understand?

44:58.040 --> 44:59.440
Oh.

[insects buzzing]

45:05.760 --> 45:07.400
Hey.

45:07.440 --> 45:10.320
Pieter.
His name was Pieter Bello.

45:10.360 --> 45:12.880
Pieter Bello.
This man? Are you sure?

45:12.920 --> 45:15.920
I heard him use it
on the phone once or twice.

45:15.960 --> 45:17.440
Once or twice?

45:17.480 --> 45:19.720
How is it
that you still remember his name

45:19.760 --> 45:22.080
after all these years?

45:22.120 --> 45:25.560
There are some people,
you know they are no good.

45:25.600 --> 45:27.400
Their soul is rotten.

45:27.440 --> 45:30.880
I knew it the first time
I set eyes on him.

45:30.920 --> 45:33.720
I would watch him.
Waiting.

45:33.760 --> 45:36.360
Expecting
to see trouble follow him.

45:36.400 --> 45:39.720
So when I heard his name,
it stuck in my mind like glue.

45:39.760 --> 45:42.960
And was he?
Wa-Was he ever any trouble?

45:43.000 --> 45:45.320
Not with me.

45:45.360 --> 45:50.000
But, ma'am,
we can never hide who we are.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.400
Nah, neither am I.

46:01.440 --> 46:04.000
Sometimes I wish I was.

46:04.040 --> 46:06.200
You can't be, I suppose,

46:06.240 --> 46:07.960
doing the things that you do.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.600
I do what I have to.

46:11.640 --> 46:13.680
Do you?

46:13.720 --> 46:15.680
I've always lived
with the belief

46:15.720 --> 46:18.600
that no one hasto do anything.

46:30.840 --> 46:33.320
Should have chosen
a different bladdy sound.

Every time I hear a cockerel,
I reach into my pocket,

46:36.240 --> 46:38.000
wondering
which one I should take.

46:38.040 --> 46:41.120
Pieter Bello,
did you come here to talk?

46:43.360 --> 46:46.080
No. Forgive me.

46:46.120 --> 46:48.120
No, I didn't.

46:52.720 --> 46:54.800
There will be more bags
like that...

46:54.840 --> 46:56.440

How are we gonna find
Pieter Bello?

47:10.320 --> 47:13.080
He's from South Africa,
so we start from there.

47:13.120 --> 47:16.280
I have a contact
in Johannesburg that...

47:17.720 --> 47:20.200
-What is it?
-Nothing.

Oh, good, you're here.

47:25.960 --> 47:27.680
-Judith, this is Emmanuel.
-Hi.

47:27.720 --> 47:29.880
Nice to meet you. Um,
I got a call from my neighbor.

47:29.920 --> 47:32.000
Somebody delivered this car
for you.

47:32.040 --> 47:34.280
They insisted I come back
from work to sign for it.

47:34.320 --> 47:36.240
I didn't rent a car.
I'd have told you.

47:36.280 --> 47:38.720
Well, paperwork's in your name,
so somebody did.
