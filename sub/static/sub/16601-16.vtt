00:07.117 --> 00:10.584
OV! OV! OV! OV!

00:10.586 --> 00:11.752
OV! OV...

00:11.754 --> 00:12.920
Yo, yo, yo.

00:12.922 --> 00:14.555
Thank you very much.

00:14.557 --> 00:15.523
Let me tell you a story.

00:15.525 --> 00:17.892
When Osvaldo V.
first told me

00:17.894 --> 00:21.194
that he wanted to support
the youth center here,

00:21.196 --> 00:22.830
I wasn't surprised.

00:22.832 --> 00:24.632
He's not just
a superstar,

00:24.634 --> 00:28.234
he's the homie that never
forgot where he came from.

00:30.872 --> 00:34.774
So I want you all
to welcome home OV.

00:36.878 --> 00:38.812
We love you, OV.

00:38.814 --> 00:41.414
Thank you, Gerry.
Guerrero,

00:41.416 --> 00:44.950
my friend, my lawyer.
Let me just say

00:44.952 --> 00:47.152
I'm glad to be back,
because I owe the barrio.

00:47.154 --> 00:49.555
And this youth center.

00:49.557 --> 00:52.724
The people that work there--
they didn't just save my life.

00:52.726 --> 00:53.992
They gave me a future.

00:53.994 --> 00:56.361
The least I can do is try to give

00:56.363 --> 00:57.563
somebody else
the same opportunity,

00:57.565 --> 00:59.230
you know what I mean?
You got to give back.

00:59.232 --> 01:00.998
And he certainly did.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
He put his money
where his mouth is,

01:03.002 --> 01:06.170
to the tune of 100K.

01:06.840 --> 01:08.539
So say hello

01:08.541 --> 01:10.808
to my little friend OV!

01:12.345 --> 01:13.978
OV! OV!

01:13.980 --> 01:15.713
OV! OV!
OV!

01:15.715 --> 01:19.516
OV! OV! OV!

01:27.893 --> 01:30.259
You the one that called in

01:30.261 --> 01:31.761
somebody trying to
break into my house?

01:31.763 --> 01:33.196
We don't know what we got.

01:33.198 --> 01:35.698
Neighborhood watch spotted this
guy looking in your windows.

01:35.700 --> 01:36.832
He says he's your

01:36.834 --> 01:39.468
brother-in-law?
Jimmy?

01:39.470 --> 01:41.022
Hey, yo, Danny.

01:41.563 --> 01:43.046
What the hell are
you doing here?

01:43.207 --> 01:44.807
I told these guys I was your
best friend in high school.

01:44.809 --> 01:46.375
I introduced you to your wife.
Sir...

01:46.377 --> 01:47.409
It's fine,
it's fine.

01:47.411 --> 01:48.978
I got it from here.
Thank you.

01:48.980 --> 01:50.545
Hey, I'm-I'm sorry, Danny,
I'm sorry.

01:50.547 --> 01:51.946
It's...
these guys, man...

01:51.948 --> 01:53.347
I haven't seen your
face in two years,

01:53.349 --> 01:55.416
you show up at my house
unannounced, poking around?

01:55.418 --> 01:58.520
Yeah, well... it was kind of
a spur of the moment thing.

01:58.522 --> 02:01.188
Uh-huh.
Come on, cut to the chase.

02:01.190 --> 02:02.724
What are you doing here?

02:03.994 --> 02:05.226
This girl I've been seeing--

02:05.228 --> 02:07.028
her, her husband
got the wrong idea.

02:07.030 --> 02:08.829
Meaning he got the right idea.

02:08.830 --> 02:11.464
I just need to lay low
for a few days, and...

02:11.466 --> 02:13.466
Oh, wait a minute.

02:13.468 --> 02:15.468
Come on, Danny, we're family.

02:15.470 --> 02:18.471
You remember Owl's Head Park?
The Kay brothers

02:18.473 --> 02:21.207
were gonna kick your punk ass.
I was there for you.

02:21.209 --> 02:22.809
You mean Larry and his crew?
Yeah. Look, you can't

02:22.811 --> 02:24.377
keep handing me that bill,
Jimmy, all right?

02:24.379 --> 02:25.912
I paid it a long time ago.

02:27.448 --> 02:29.015
Come on, Danny.

02:29.017 --> 02:31.483
Can you help me out
for old time's sake?

02:31.485 --> 02:34.253
And I'd love to see
Linda and the boys.

02:36.290 --> 02:38.591
Oh...

02:38.593 --> 02:41.360
All right, fine. You can stay
for a day or two, all right?

02:41.362 --> 02:42.694
And don't make me regret it.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.829
Danny, you're a saint.
I knew I could count on you.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.798
Ah, no hugs! Don't hug.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.701
Come on...

02:49.703 --> 02:51.269
Bro, it's so good to see you.

02:51.271 --> 02:52.537
Oh, man, it's been a long time.

02:52.539 --> 02:54.739
I flipped out when I saw you
out in that crowd, man.

02:54.741 --> 02:57.576
I can't believe you came back
with that fat check, man.

02:57.578 --> 02:59.577
Yo, man, I got to be
true to the game, right?

02:59.579 --> 03:02.412
I mean, and, honestly, yo, it's
my pleasure to be lucky enough

03:02.414 --> 03:04.314
to have something to
give back, you know-- oh!

03:04.316 --> 03:06.550
NYPD!
Come on, man!

03:06.552 --> 03:08.118
You're under arrest!
What-what'd I do, man?

03:08.120 --> 03:10.554
- Police! What are you talking about, man?
- Leave him alone!

03:10.556 --> 03:12.990
- You're under arrest! Hands together!
- What are you doing?!

03:12.992 --> 03:14.625
You better listen to me.
I'm a cop.

03:14.627 --> 03:15.959
Come on, Ger-Gerry!

03:15.961 --> 03:16.993
That's my client!

03:16.995 --> 03:18.761
You're in a lot of trouble,
Officer!

03:18.763 --> 03:20.129
He's under arrest.
Yes, you are!

03:22.300 --> 03:24.067
Did you even look
at the crime scene video?

03:24.069 --> 03:25.234
Yeah, I looked at it.
It was

03:25.236 --> 03:26.636
the wrong guy.
Who, from 20 yards,

03:26.638 --> 03:27.804
looked like
the right guy.

03:27.806 --> 03:29.405
Honest mistake.
You're missing the point.

03:29.407 --> 03:30.640
That <i>is</i> the point.

03:30.642 --> 03:32.341
Nobody's perfect.
We'll apologize.

03:32.343 --> 03:33.775
Did I hear “apologize”?
Yeah.

03:33.777 --> 03:35.577
We made a mistake,
we'll apologize for it.

03:35.579 --> 03:36.979
Too late, Guerrero
has already filed

03:36.981 --> 03:38.714
to see the outcome
of any previous

03:38.716 --> 03:41.883
disciplinary hearings
against Sergeant Donahue.

03:42.786 --> 03:44.219
Were there any?

03:44.221 --> 03:45.754
He's had a few complaints.

03:45.756 --> 03:47.155
Same as any other active cop.

03:47.157 --> 03:49.324
Any substantiated?
At least three.

03:49.326 --> 03:51.425
I'm not sure how serious
any of them were,

03:51.427 --> 03:52.627
but we're looking into 'em now.

03:52.629 --> 03:53.995
Let's assume
they're not dynamite.

03:53.997 --> 03:56.330
We share them with Guerrero,
this thing deflates.

03:56.332 --> 03:57.531
We can't
share them.

03:57.533 --> 03:58.666
Legal says we cannot release

03:58.668 --> 04:00.701
those records.
It is now a state law.

04:00.703 --> 04:02.103
There's got to be
a way around it.

04:02.105 --> 04:03.137
We're not gonna share 'em.

04:03.139 --> 04:04.772
It would alienate
the rank and file.

04:04.774 --> 04:06.773
And lawyers like Guerrero
are gonna try to turn every

04:06.775 --> 04:08.241
mole hill into a mountain.
But if we don't

04:08.243 --> 04:10.110
release 'em, it looks
like we're hiding something.

04:10.112 --> 04:13.980
Hey! Could we just
find out what we have?

04:13.982 --> 04:15.281
Yes, sir.

Sir, your VIP is here.

04:58.018 --> 04:59.050
Hey.

04:59.052 --> 05:00.719
Busy day?

05:00.721 --> 05:02.854
Always.

05:02.856 --> 05:04.656
But brighter,
now that you're here.

05:07.460 --> 05:09.126
Coffee?

05:09.128 --> 05:10.661
Soda pop?

05:10.663 --> 05:12.563
Coffee.

05:13.833 --> 05:15.499
We don't have soda pop.

05:15.501 --> 05:17.702
Look, I don't know
how much Mom told you

05:17.704 --> 05:20.003
about what I'm doing, but
I got assigned a field study

05:20.005 --> 05:22.572
for my legal pluralism,
gender and religion class...

05:22.574 --> 05:24.507
You know, that is right
where I stopped her.

05:24.509 --> 05:27.043
I'm all for higher education,
but that word salad

05:27.045 --> 05:29.379
that goes with it,
not so much.

05:29.381 --> 05:31.414
But you said yes
to a ride-along.

05:31.416 --> 05:33.182
Against my better
judgment, but yes.

05:33.184 --> 05:35.365
Riding with Uncle Jamie isn't
a real ride-along, though.

05:35.366 --> 05:36.088
How so?

05:36.112 --> 05:37.919
Well, because he's
my Uncle Jamie.

05:38.257 --> 05:40.088
Well, he's a cop,
a terrific one;

05:40.090 --> 05:41.457
as is his partner.

05:41.459 --> 05:43.925
- It's not the same.
- No, it's not the same.

05:43.927 --> 05:46.228
If you were riding along
with Officer Smith and Jones,

05:46.230 --> 05:47.229
it would be different.

05:47.231 --> 05:48.797
- Exactly.
- They would be treating you

05:48.799 --> 05:52.568
as the PC's granddaughter,
and everything you saw or heard

05:52.570 --> 05:55.103
would be filtered through that.

05:55.939 --> 05:57.372
Oh.

05:57.374 --> 06:00.007
It would be a theme park ride.

06:00.009 --> 06:01.542
- But Uncle Jamie...
- Has sat with you

06:01.544 --> 06:04.044
at family dinners since
you were in a booster seat,

06:04.046 --> 06:06.080
so he should have
a pretty good idea

06:06.082 --> 06:07.582
how far he can take you.

06:07.584 --> 06:08.949
Which is how far?

06:10.119 --> 06:11.552
What do you hope to see?

06:11.554 --> 06:12.820
The real thing.

06:12.822 --> 06:15.088
The real thing can be
real messy.

06:15.090 --> 06:16.356
I know that.

06:16.358 --> 06:18.057
You do and you don't.

06:18.059 --> 06:19.993
What does that mean?

06:19.995 --> 06:22.529
It means that at street level
things are different--

06:22.531 --> 06:25.098
it's not just white hats
and black hats.

06:25.100 --> 06:28.067
I know that, too.

06:30.205 --> 06:32.538
I know you know that.

06:33.541 --> 06:35.741
All right, how about this?
Let's just say,

06:35.743 --> 06:38.911
for sake of this field study,
you don't know what you know,

06:38.913 --> 06:41.880
you're just willing to keep
your eyes and ears wide open.

06:41.882 --> 06:43.349
That work?

06:43.351 --> 06:45.384
That works.

06:45.386 --> 06:46.686
Thank you.

06:46.688 --> 06:48.787
Absolutely.

06:48.789 --> 06:50.154
Anything else?

06:50.156 --> 06:52.190
Nope. Can I wear one
of those shiny badges

06:52.192 --> 06:54.326
I used to get here
when I was little?

06:54.328 --> 06:55.960
You're too old for that.

06:55.962 --> 06:57.796
I know.

07:13.846 --> 07:17.481
You would have thought
that we'd be past all this.

07:17.483 --> 07:21.051
You would have thought
that we wouldn't allow racist

07:21.053 --> 07:24.186
police officers on the street

07:24.188 --> 07:26.322
who can't tell the difference

07:26.324 --> 07:29.525
between a platinum
recording artist

07:29.527 --> 07:31.327
and a common criminal.

07:32.364 --> 07:33.529
What's wrong with people?!

07:33.531 --> 07:35.030
This has got to stop!
Listen,

07:35.032 --> 07:38.567
what we need to know is
has this happened before

07:38.569 --> 07:40.101
with this officer?

07:40.103 --> 07:41.336
And if it has,

07:41.338 --> 07:44.072
why is he still on the streets
with a badge?

07:44.074 --> 07:45.240
Get him out!
Get him out!

07:45.242 --> 07:47.843
Police Commissioner
Frank Reagan,

07:47.845 --> 07:49.611
the white knight...

07:49.613 --> 07:51.346
who's always talking about

07:51.348 --> 07:54.282
integrity, accountability.

07:54.284 --> 07:57.718
He's blocking our efforts
to learn the truth,

07:57.720 --> 07:59.987
and we're not gonna let him
get away with it!

07:59.989 --> 08:01.188
<i>Justicia!</i>

08:01.190 --> 08:02.322
No more!

08:02.324 --> 08:04.024
No more!
<i>Justicia!</i>

08:07.096 --> 08:09.129
Jones passes
to Major, who scores!

08:09.131 --> 08:11.465
Oh, Major, baby!
Hey!

08:11.467 --> 08:13.400
Ha!

08:13.402 --> 08:15.034
What are we,
in high school? Geez!

08:15.036 --> 08:16.102
Hey!

08:16.104 --> 08:17.136
Hey.

08:17.138 --> 08:19.572
- Right at home.
- Look who's here. Yeah.

08:19.574 --> 08:22.041
Hey, foxy mama.
Hey, Jimmy.

08:22.043 --> 08:23.510
How you doing?

08:23.512 --> 08:24.644
Mm.

08:24.646 --> 08:26.045
You look so good.

08:26.047 --> 08:27.881
How come you
keep getting younger

08:27.883 --> 08:29.181
and I keep getting older?

08:29.183 --> 08:31.550
Oh, stop it. It's good
to see you, too, Jimmy.

08:31.552 --> 08:33.183
Who are these studs?
What'd you do

08:33.186 --> 08:34.820
with the little brats
you had before?

08:34.822 --> 08:36.388
They grew up.
How about that, huh?

08:36.390 --> 08:37.789
You guys remember me?

08:37.792 --> 08:38.690
Yeah.

08:38.692 --> 08:39.857
It's been a while.
Yeah, we got

08:39.860 --> 08:41.359
to catch up.
I'll tell you what your parents

08:41.361 --> 08:43.529
were really like when they
were your age. Let me tell you?

08:43.530 --> 08:44.996
Yeah, I'd like to hear that.

08:44.998 --> 08:47.331
Your father,
he was hell on wheels.

08:47.333 --> 08:48.466
And your mother,

08:48.468 --> 08:49.567
she was no angel, either.

08:49.569 --> 08:51.001
Okay.

08:51.003 --> 08:52.269
You know, Danny,

08:52.271 --> 08:54.872
I was thinking we should put
Jimmy in the basement room.

08:54.874 --> 08:56.373
That's a great idea.
Boys, why don't you

08:56.375 --> 08:57.775
show your uncle
where he's gonna stay.

08:57.777 --> 08:59.043
All right.
Great.

09:00.647 --> 09:03.414
Go ahead. Keep him
down there for a while.

09:03.416 --> 09:04.536
You guys should be
going to church.

09:05.951 --> 09:07.631
I am so sorry he showed up
like this again.

09:07.921 --> 09:10.620
Well, you know,
it's not your fault.

09:10.622 --> 09:13.256
Jimmy's Jimmy, you know?
It's always something.

09:13.258 --> 09:15.249
Well, let's just hope
it's nothing this time.

09:15.273 --> 09:16.126
Yeah, let's.

09:16.127 --> 09:19.696
Uh, why don't we go come up
with something for dinner, okay?

09:23.367 --> 09:26.535
Really? This is the most
serious call of the day?

09:26.537 --> 09:28.471
A noise complaint?

09:28.473 --> 09:31.073
Sorry to disappoint you.

09:31.075 --> 09:33.308
It's not all action
all the time, Nicky.

09:33.310 --> 09:35.744
85% of the job's
just dealing with the public.

09:35.746 --> 09:37.645
Do you mind?

09:40.183 --> 09:41.716
We got a call

09:41.718 --> 09:43.918
about loud music coming
from this apartment.

09:44.855 --> 09:46.220
Everything
okay, ma'am?

09:46.222 --> 09:48.656
Yes. Hello, Officer.
No problem at all.

09:48.658 --> 09:49.557
Make him stop!

09:49.559 --> 09:50.492
Kids.

09:50.494 --> 09:51.860
Be quiet.
Leave me alone!

09:51.862 --> 09:53.895
Quiet.

09:53.897 --> 09:55.796
I am so sorry about the music.

09:55.798 --> 09:57.731
Ma'am, do you mind
if we come in,

09:57.733 --> 09:59.265
take a look?

10:00.536 --> 10:03.403
Of course. You're the police.

10:05.841 --> 10:07.207
Hey.

10:15.683 --> 10:17.984
Ma'am, are you all right?

10:18.820 --> 10:21.286
Yes, I am just clumsy.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.222
I fell in the shower.

10:23.224 --> 10:25.057
That bruise
on your cheek,

10:25.059 --> 10:27.426
you got that mark
falling in the shower?

10:27.428 --> 10:29.995
Where are you going?

10:29.997 --> 10:33.197
I said I wasn't done
talking to you.

10:34.568 --> 10:37.268
Officers, is
everything all right?

10:37.270 --> 10:38.469
That's what
we're here to find out.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.304
We're investigating
a complaint.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.305
Really?

10:41.307 --> 10:43.608
There's been
some disturbance in the house.

10:44.711 --> 10:46.176
Oh. Oh, forgive me.

10:46.178 --> 10:48.512
My, uh... my children can

10:48.514 --> 10:50.080
be, um,

10:50.082 --> 10:52.416
how you say, uh, rambunctious.
If it's just

10:52.418 --> 10:54.852
your kids, then why do you have
a broken necklace in your hand?

10:54.854 --> 10:56.654
Nicky,

10:56.656 --> 10:59.256
we got this, okay? Please.

10:59.258 --> 11:00.991
I was fixing it
for my wife.

11:00.993 --> 11:02.526
- Is this against the law?
- Sir, we're just trying

11:02.528 --> 11:04.260
to make sure
everyone's okay here.

11:04.262 --> 11:06.128
Oh. Everyone is okay.

11:06.130 --> 11:07.530
There's no problem.

11:08.366 --> 11:09.999
Nada,

11:10.001 --> 11:12.268
tell them
what they need to hear.

11:14.940 --> 11:15.705
Nada.

11:15.707 --> 11:16.839
Sir.
No.

11:16.841 --> 11:18.007
- No, no.
- Sir,

11:18.009 --> 11:19.308
stop pressuring her.

11:19.310 --> 11:21.276
I'm fine.

11:21.278 --> 11:23.211
I have no complaint.

11:23.213 --> 11:26.347
I would just like
to be with my family.

11:27.618 --> 11:29.618
You can go.

11:29.620 --> 11:32.854
I thank you for your concern.

11:37.526 --> 11:39.326
Let's go.

11:39.328 --> 11:40.895
Have a nice day.

11:40.897 --> 11:42.529
Thank you again.

11:46.836 --> 11:48.970
That's it?
You're just gonna leave?

11:48.972 --> 11:50.838
If she doesn't want to file
a complaint,

11:50.840 --> 11:52.740
there's nothing we can do.

11:52.742 --> 11:54.975
I'm sorry.
Come on.

12:05.338 --> 12:08.372
♪ Powers that be just don't
pick our destiny 'cause... ♪

12:08.374 --> 12:09.606

12:09.608 --> 12:12.242

12:14.980 --> 12:17.681

12:17.683 --> 12:20.417

Party's over!

12:23.755 --> 12:24.687
Hey, Dad.

12:24.689 --> 12:25.688
Don't “Hey, Dad” me.

12:25.690 --> 12:27.923
Hey.
Jimmy, what are you thinking?

12:27.925 --> 12:29.558
Do my boys look 21 to you?

12:29.560 --> 12:31.660
No, these bottles are mine.
I swear.

12:31.662 --> 12:33.596
Uh-huh. And what's with
all the cash? Whose is that?

12:33.598 --> 12:35.798
Well-well, that's mine now.

12:36.333 --> 12:37.400
It's not yours now.

12:37.402 --> 12:38.768
We've been gone two hours!

12:38.770 --> 12:40.535
And you're already teaching
our kids how to gamble?

12:40.537 --> 12:42.704
It is a school night, Jimmy.

12:42.706 --> 12:45.139
I remember when Mom caught you
drinking. I covered for you.

12:45.141 --> 12:46.841
I haven't heard this one.

12:46.843 --> 12:48.610
- Yeah, and you won't.
- That's right.

12:48.612 --> 12:50.144
Because your uncle is leaving.

12:50.146 --> 12:51.846
Tonight.

12:51.848 --> 12:52.914
Dad...
And both of you

12:52.916 --> 12:54.549
upstairs! It's a school night.
Mom...

12:54.551 --> 12:55.650
I just said that. Go.

12:55.652 --> 12:56.851
Good night.

12:56.853 --> 12:57.751
Good night, guys.

12:57.753 --> 12:59.720
Hey, come on.

12:59.722 --> 13:00.587
Come on, you guys.

13:00.589 --> 13:01.822
No. Forget it.

13:01.824 --> 13:02.923
You are out of here.

13:02.925 --> 13:04.425
Linda, don't do this.
I'm sorry.

13:04.427 --> 13:07.160
I am so tired
of making excuses for you.

13:07.162 --> 13:08.762
This is too much.

13:08.764 --> 13:10.964
You're not gonna put me out
tonight.

13:10.966 --> 13:12.299
You can't.

13:12.301 --> 13:13.434
What do you mean we can't?

13:14.769 --> 13:16.903
Danny,

13:16.905 --> 13:20.873
did you happen to notice
that car out front?

13:30.752 --> 13:32.551
Hey.

13:34.254 --> 13:35.854
Danny Reagan.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.355
How is everything?

13:37.357 --> 13:39.658
How's it going, Stevie?

13:39.660 --> 13:41.159
Real good.
You remember Lenny Sick

13:41.161 --> 13:42.260
from the old neighborhood,
right?

13:42.262 --> 13:44.596
Good to see you, Danny.
Long time.

13:44.598 --> 13:48.299
Yeah. I hear you been sitting
on my house all night. Why?

13:48.301 --> 13:50.400
This is your house?
Oh, it's very nice.

13:50.402 --> 13:51.569
Come on. What do you want?

13:51.571 --> 13:52.803
Ask your brother-in-law.

13:52.805 --> 13:54.572
I'm asking you.
Any chance

13:54.574 --> 13:56.874
Jimmy tell you what happened
at our club the other night?

13:58.077 --> 14:01.211
Something about some problem
with somebody else's girl.

14:01.213 --> 14:02.145
He tell you whose?

14:02.147 --> 14:03.714
'Course not.
Then he'd have

14:03.716 --> 14:05.748
to explain how it was
Sal the Horse's goomah

14:05.750 --> 14:08.117
and that Jimmy hit Sal over
the head with a champagne bottle

14:08.119 --> 14:09.452
when they
got into it.

14:09.454 --> 14:11.588
The back of the head.
We're talking

14:11.590 --> 14:13.656
about Sal Garofalo?
Listen to me,

14:13.658 --> 14:15.558
Sal is in intensive care right
now because your brother-in-law

14:15.560 --> 14:16.960
came up behind him.

14:16.962 --> 14:19.428
That can't stand.
You know that, right?

14:19.430 --> 14:21.430
And none of you guys
called the police?

14:21.432 --> 14:22.564
This is our world, Danny.

14:22.566 --> 14:23.899
The police handle things
their way.

14:23.901 --> 14:26.167
We handle them our way.
You know what I'm saying?

14:26.169 --> 14:30.305
Your brother-in-law's
in a lot of trouble, my man.

14:30.307 --> 14:32.007
Look, whatever my
brother-in-law's problem is,

14:32.009 --> 14:34.643
it's his problem,
not mine. Okay?

14:34.645 --> 14:36.645
But for now, you two need
to get away from my house

14:36.647 --> 14:38.349
and stay the hell away
from my family.

14:38.373 --> 14:38.915
No disrespect,

14:38.916 --> 14:40.882
Danny, but something like this
happened to the cops,

14:40.884 --> 14:42.950
you'd expect us to do
the right thing, right?

14:42.952 --> 14:45.185
Fair enough.

14:45.187 --> 14:46.353
This is not over.

14:46.355 --> 14:48.689
Give my love to your wife,
will ya?

14:50.226 --> 14:52.092
Let's go, Lenny.

15:02.470 --> 15:04.270
And I talked
to the investigators

15:04.272 --> 15:06.139
in all three cases
where the allegations

15:06.141 --> 15:08.008
against Sergeant Donahue
were substantiated.

15:08.010 --> 15:09.910
- And?
- Sorry.

15:09.912 --> 15:11.511
All three were minor matters.

15:11.513 --> 15:14.212
One involved
foul language.

15:14.214 --> 15:15.581
And the other two?

15:15.583 --> 15:17.282
Abuse of authority
and excessive force.

15:17.284 --> 15:19.018
Both involved the
misidentification

15:19.020 --> 15:20.920
of suspects, which,

15:20.922 --> 15:22.755
taken on their own,
not so bad...

15:22.757 --> 15:23.923
But with the new one...

15:23.925 --> 15:24.924
It looks like a pattern.

15:24.926 --> 15:27.125
To any and everyone
who's not a cop.

15:27.127 --> 15:28.561
Boss, I'm not
a policy guy,

15:28.563 --> 15:30.228
but if we give way on this,

15:30.230 --> 15:32.030
you're opening Pandora's box.

15:32.032 --> 15:35.099
It's staying locked. We are
not releasing those records.

15:35.101 --> 15:38.302
Guerrero wants to change
the law, he can run for office.

15:38.304 --> 15:39.737
He's already done
the next best thing.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.305
He just announced
that he's filing

15:41.307 --> 15:43.775
a federal action charging
the department

15:43.777 --> 15:46.243
with failure
to supervise the sergeant.

15:46.245 --> 15:47.678
It'll never go anywhere.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.212
It'll go around the block,
at least.

15:49.214 --> 15:50.714
He named you in the action.

15:50.716 --> 15:51.514
He did?

15:51.516 --> 15:52.282
Yes.

15:52.284 --> 15:55.485
Wow, the Full Gerry.

15:56.288 --> 15:58.288
If he's pushing this hard,

15:58.290 --> 15:59.957
he thinks he's got something.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.726
There's a preliminary hearing
scheduled for later this week.

16:02.728 --> 16:05.260
And, no, you are not going.

16:05.262 --> 16:08.330
Not your decision.
I can handle Gerry just fine.

16:08.332 --> 16:10.132
Hearing. Courtroom.

16:10.134 --> 16:13.027
His home turf. I don't care
how prepared you get,

16:13.028 --> 16:14.727
you'd still be walking
into an ambush.

16:14.729 --> 16:16.930
He's right, boss.

16:25.039 --> 16:27.139
Oh, what a nice surprise.

16:27.141 --> 16:29.808
I think I just got my first
taste of the real world.

16:29.810 --> 16:31.410
What happened?

16:31.412 --> 16:33.545
I went to a call
with Jamie and his partner.

16:33.547 --> 16:35.513
It was just so obvious
that this husband

16:35.515 --> 16:38.050
had been beating the wife,
but Jamie said

16:38.052 --> 16:39.883
that there was nothing
he could do about it.

16:39.885 --> 16:41.986
Was the wife willing
to file a complaint?

16:41.988 --> 16:44.655
No. But only
because he was intimidating her.

16:44.657 --> 16:46.723
Have a seat, Nicky.

16:48.694 --> 16:51.762
You said you wanted to see
how the real world works.

16:51.764 --> 16:54.065
Well, this is it.

16:54.067 --> 16:56.333
If the woman's injuries
weren't severe

16:56.335 --> 16:58.101
and she specifically said
she didn't want

16:58.103 --> 16:59.769
to have her husband arrested,

16:59.771 --> 17:01.871
then Jamie's hands are tied.

17:01.873 --> 17:03.073
He could have pushed it.

17:03.075 --> 17:05.040
I'm not gonna start telling
Jamie how to do his job.

17:05.042 --> 17:06.309
Neither should you.

17:06.310 --> 17:08.544
Didn't everybody in this family
take an oath?

17:08.546 --> 17:10.280
I get it, Nicky.

17:10.281 --> 17:12.315
And your heart's
in the right place.

17:12.317 --> 17:14.915
But these things
are complicated.

17:14.917 --> 17:16.852
And sometimes
you just need to know

17:16.854 --> 17:19.721
when to cut your losses and...

17:19.723 --> 17:22.723
walk away.

17:31.501 --> 17:34.102
All right. Enough
of the silent treatment.

17:34.104 --> 17:36.104
Can you just tell me
where we're going, please?

17:36.106 --> 17:39.040
You, my friend, are going
to the no-tell motel.

17:39.042 --> 17:41.442
That's where we put all the
other mopes who screw up.

17:41.444 --> 17:42.810
I'm covering you
for three nights.

17:42.812 --> 17:44.212
Then that's it.
You're on your own.

17:44.214 --> 17:45.113
What did I do?

17:45.115 --> 17:46.147
It's not what you did do.

17:46.149 --> 17:47.447
It's what you didn't do.

17:47.449 --> 17:49.983
You didn't tell me you put
a made guy in the ICU.

17:49.985 --> 17:52.585
I didn't lie to you. I told you
I had a fight over a girl.

17:53.722 --> 17:55.222
What? I was defending myself.

17:55.224 --> 17:56.623
I was. I swear.

17:56.625 --> 17:58.058
Well, great,
you were defending yourself

17:58.060 --> 18:01.194
against a made guy whose girl
you were sleeping with.

18:01.196 --> 18:03.230
Now I got Stevie Angels
and Lenny Sick

18:03.232 --> 18:04.696
sitting in front of my house.

18:04.698 --> 18:07.199
Really? He brought Lenny Sick?

18:07.201 --> 18:10.236
Yeah. And you and me both know
why they call him that.

18:10.238 --> 18:12.438
Oh, man.

18:12.440 --> 18:14.507
Animal outside my house.
Where I live,

18:14.509 --> 18:16.942
your sister lives,
your nephews sleep.

18:16.944 --> 18:20.212
I never thought
it would go this far.

18:20.214 --> 18:21.212
Well, it did.

18:21.214 --> 18:22.780
And now you got to go.

18:22.782 --> 18:27.485
Danny, they're gonna chop me up
and throw me into the Gowanus.

18:27.487 --> 18:29.687
Look, just lay low
for a few days

18:29.689 --> 18:31.189
till you figure out
your next play.

18:31.191 --> 18:33.058
How? I'm broke, Danny.

18:33.060 --> 18:35.060
Look, I'm begging.
You got to talk to these guys.

18:35.062 --> 18:36.194
You got to straighten it out.

18:36.196 --> 18:38.895
I got to clean up
your mess again?

18:38.897 --> 18:40.931
You know something, Jimmy,
every day that goes by,

18:40.933 --> 18:44.601
Owl's Head Park gets a little
bit further in the rearview.

18:44.603 --> 18:47.904
Danny, if there was some way
I could've kept you out of this,

18:47.906 --> 18:49.306
I would've.

18:50.476 --> 18:52.676
I'm sorry.

18:59.750 --> 19:02.685
Thanks for going the
extra mile, Uncle Jamie.

19:02.687 --> 19:04.520
Just not sure
how much good it'll do

19:04.522 --> 19:07.290
if the wife's still not
willing to file a complaint.

19:10.828 --> 19:14.129
Ma'am, we wanted to follow up
on our previous visit.

19:14.131 --> 19:15.297
Is your husband home?

19:15.299 --> 19:16.898
No, not yet.

19:16.900 --> 19:18.666
May we come in a minute?

19:18.668 --> 19:20.835
Yes. Quickly.

19:25.008 --> 19:27.309
We're here because your
neighbors have expressed concern

19:27.311 --> 19:28.710
about what's going
on in this house

19:28.712 --> 19:29.977
with you and
your children.

19:29.979 --> 19:31.212
I told you we're fine.

19:31.214 --> 19:33.780
Okay, but we just
wanted a chance to talk

19:33.782 --> 19:35.149
to you and your
kids separately.

19:35.151 --> 19:36.550
This is not necessary.

19:36.552 --> 19:39.620
Ivano is the father
of my children. He provides.

19:39.622 --> 19:40.954
It also looks like he beats you

19:40.956 --> 19:43.090
and threatens you
to keep quiet about it.

19:43.092 --> 19:43.890
Nicky...

19:43.892 --> 19:44.825
How old are you?

19:44.827 --> 19:46.126
You are a schoolgirl.

19:46.128 --> 19:48.128
Do you have a husband
of your own?

19:48.130 --> 19:50.096
Children to take care of?

19:50.098 --> 19:51.631
No, but...
If the police take away

19:51.633 --> 19:53.299
my husband,
who pays the rent?

19:53.301 --> 19:55.901
Who puts food on the table?

19:55.903 --> 19:57.504
Do you want us
to end up in a shelter,

19:57.506 --> 19:59.071
like homeless people?

19:59.073 --> 20:00.706
Ma'am, there are other options.

20:00.708 --> 20:03.009
Mama,

20:03.011 --> 20:04.009
is everything all right?

20:04.011 --> 20:05.677
It's okay.

20:05.679 --> 20:08.380
Take your homework
and go back to your room.

20:20.027 --> 20:21.925
I think you should go now.

20:23.196 --> 20:25.596
Ivano, I swear,

20:25.598 --> 20:26.497
they just showed up...

20:26.499 --> 20:27.698
Shh!

20:27.700 --> 20:30.301
Your neighbors have expressed
some concern to us

20:30.303 --> 20:31.969
about the condition
of your children.

20:31.971 --> 20:35.773
Officer, I-I think
we have a misunderstanding.

20:35.775 --> 20:39.709
You look at me and you see
someone who fixes boilers,

20:39.711 --> 20:41.110
unclogs toilets.

20:41.112 --> 20:42.845
But back home,

20:42.847 --> 20:44.747
I was prosecutor for the state.

20:44.749 --> 20:47.417
I understand the law as
well as you do. And I know

20:47.419 --> 20:50.687
that you have no reason
to keep bothering us.

20:50.689 --> 20:51.854
Then why don't
you let your wife

20:51.856 --> 20:53.890
speak to us on her own?
Stop it.

20:53.892 --> 20:56.192
And it's you. It is you.

20:56.194 --> 20:59.728
Huh. Please,
we have cooperated enough.

20:59.730 --> 21:02.231
Now you must go.

21:03.434 --> 21:05.601
Here.

21:05.603 --> 21:07.636
You can take this with you.

21:07.638 --> 21:09.071
Please, here, here.

21:09.073 --> 21:10.906
Go, go.
Take this with you.

21:10.908 --> 21:13.641
- Take the garbage.
- We're not your garbage men.

21:24.197 --> 21:25.430
Baez, I'm going in.

21:25.769 --> 21:27.435
If you don't hear from me
in ten, 15 minutes,

21:27.437 --> 21:31.383
I want you to send a 10-13
to the address I gave you, okay?

21:31.384 --> 21:33.717
Yeah.

21:36.788 --> 21:38.254
What's the matter?

21:38.256 --> 21:40.290
Afraid somebody's gonna see you,
put you in the FBI scrapbook?

21:40.292 --> 21:41.724
Come on, would ya?

22:05.615 --> 22:08.449
You know I counted about
a dozen indictments out there?

22:08.451 --> 22:10.284
And that's just
sitting at the bar.

22:10.286 --> 22:12.653
Tony, give us a couple
of minutes, will you?

22:21.096 --> 22:23.129
I'm not wearing a wire, okay?

22:23.131 --> 22:25.231
I'm not here on official
police business.

22:25.233 --> 22:26.599
Well, it's good to see you
again, Danny.

22:26.601 --> 22:28.668
Why don't you take a seat?
Make yourself comfortable.

22:28.670 --> 22:29.769
I don't have time.

22:29.771 --> 22:31.237
Neither does your
brother-in-law.

22:31.239 --> 22:33.673
First and foremost,

22:33.675 --> 22:35.475
you two need to stay away
from my house.

22:35.477 --> 22:37.877
This was never about you
or your wife and kids, Danny.

22:37.879 --> 22:39.311
But if I was Jimmy,
I wouldn't buy tickets

22:39.313 --> 22:41.179
to the ballet next season.

22:41.181 --> 22:43.315
Unless it's the Nutcracker.

22:45.519 --> 22:47.720
I can't help it.
I got to be me.

22:47.722 --> 22:49.120
I'm sick.

22:49.122 --> 22:51.923
Look, Jimmy screwed up, okay?

22:51.925 --> 22:53.625
What can we do to make it right?

22:53.627 --> 22:55.360
You know how this
thing of ours works.

22:55.362 --> 22:57.294
They're saying Sal may have
brain damage.

22:57.296 --> 23:00.297
Well, some would say that's
a preexisting condition.

23:00.299 --> 23:01.566
This isn't a damn joke.

23:01.568 --> 23:03.033
Jimmy disrespected the club.

23:03.035 --> 23:04.802
He disrespected the borgata.

23:04.804 --> 23:07.204
Bottom line-- he's got to go.

23:07.206 --> 23:08.239
Got to go?

23:08.241 --> 23:10.475
You do realize
you're talking

23:10.477 --> 23:12.942
to an NYPD Police Detective.

23:12.944 --> 23:16.079
And talking about whacking his
brother-in-law, on top of that.

23:16.081 --> 23:18.081
You said it yourself--
you're not here as a cop.

23:18.083 --> 23:20.216
I know what I said, okay?
But both you know

23:20.218 --> 23:21.852
that I can't and won't
let that happen.

23:21.854 --> 23:23.754
I don't see where you
have a choice.

23:23.756 --> 23:25.789
Then maybe you need glasses.

23:25.791 --> 23:28.458
How's that motel
where you got Jimmy?

23:28.460 --> 23:29.759
They got room service?

23:30.728 --> 23:33.729
Look, I got issues with Jimmy,
myself.

23:33.731 --> 23:35.865
Okay? But he's my
brother-in-law,

23:35.867 --> 23:38.300
godfather to my kids.

23:38.302 --> 23:40.135
I'm just here
to work something out,

23:40.137 --> 23:42.538
not to sign off on a hit.

23:43.841 --> 23:46.941
Danny, you and me always
got along, right?

23:46.943 --> 23:48.543
And I've always had

23:48.545 --> 23:50.311
a soft spot for Linda.

23:51.515 --> 23:53.415
So here's what I'm saying
to you.

23:53.417 --> 23:55.349
If you're willing to bring
Jimmy in here,

23:55.351 --> 23:57.351
personally, to apologize,

23:57.353 --> 23:59.421
I promise he won't end up
on a slab.

23:59.423 --> 24:01.155
- What does that mean?
- There's gonna be a conversation.

24:01.157 --> 24:04.157
It's gonna be serious.

24:04.159 --> 24:07.628
But there won't be a funeral.

24:07.630 --> 24:09.863
I promise you,
you deliver him personally,

24:09.865 --> 24:12.566
that's the end of it.

24:16.271 --> 24:18.371
Well, end of it or not,

24:18.373 --> 24:21.307
it would behoove both of you
to stay away from my house.

24:21.309 --> 24:24.043
Done. As long as Jimmy
shows up here tonight.

24:24.045 --> 24:26.646
If not, all bets are off, pal.

24:26.648 --> 24:30.316
So be it.

24:30.318 --> 24:32.184
Oh, and Danny?

24:32.186 --> 24:34.420
I wouldn't talk this
over with the wife.

24:45.599 --> 24:47.065
Pop.

24:47.067 --> 24:48.399
Yeah.

24:48.401 --> 24:49.768
You got a minute?

24:49.770 --> 24:51.603
Yeah, sure.

24:53.941 --> 24:55.372
What's up?

24:55.374 --> 24:57.541
When Guerrero dropped me
in the middle of this thing,

24:57.543 --> 24:59.242
he had a reason.

24:59.244 --> 25:02.847
So I pulled all my files.

25:02.849 --> 25:07.217
And?
And one was missing.

25:07.219 --> 25:08.719
How do you know it was just one?

25:08.721 --> 25:11.188
Pop, I remember every rip
I ever got,

25:11.190 --> 25:14.524
and the worst one
was in that file.

25:14.526 --> 25:16.359
And you think I'd know
where it is?

25:16.361 --> 25:17.827
Well, I'm asking my father,

25:17.829 --> 25:19.896
who was commissioner at the time
I got the rip.

25:19.898 --> 25:22.465
If you're implying that I tried
to bury it, son...

25:22.467 --> 25:23.466
No, no. I'm not.

25:23.468 --> 25:25.267
'Cause I wouldn't and I didn't.

25:25.269 --> 25:26.569
Well, don't get cranky.
I'm just...

25:26.571 --> 25:29.037
trying to eliminate
the possibilities.

25:29.039 --> 25:31.807
So what's left?

25:31.809 --> 25:35.143
That it got lost in a warehouse

25:35.145 --> 25:37.178
or missing when we went digital.

25:37.180 --> 25:38.580
There you go.

25:38.582 --> 25:42.951
Or that Gerry Guerrero
got to it.

25:42.953 --> 25:44.853
Oh.

25:44.855 --> 25:46.020
Yeah.

25:46.022 --> 25:47.955
How?

25:47.957 --> 25:51.526
It would be dangerously naive
not to think

25:51.528 --> 25:55.596
that he has people in the
department in his pocket.

25:55.598 --> 25:57.231
Oh.

25:59.569 --> 26:01.368
Want a drink?

26:01.370 --> 26:03.837
Yes, I do.

26:16.752 --> 26:19.218
Oh. You're not
the pizza guy.

26:19.220 --> 26:20.953
And you're not Jimmy.
Where is he?

26:20.955 --> 26:23.188
Jimmy.

26:23.190 --> 26:24.657
Cops are here.

26:26.260 --> 26:28.260
Oh.

26:28.262 --> 26:29.795
Hey, Danny.

26:29.797 --> 26:31.030
What's up, man?

26:31.032 --> 26:33.165
You call this keeping
a low profile?

26:33.167 --> 26:35.000
Oh, Colbert is on.
I love him.

26:35.002 --> 26:36.968
Hey, you. Why don't
you beat it, okay?

26:36.970 --> 26:39.236
Yeah. What do you want me to do,
go powder my nose?

26:40.607 --> 26:42.540
Come on, baby. Powder
your nose, let's go.

26:42.542 --> 26:44.642
There better be an extra 50

26:44.644 --> 26:46.644
on that night table
when I come back.

26:48.147 --> 26:49.747
Get some clothes on.
We got to go.

26:49.749 --> 26:50.615
Where are we going?

26:50.617 --> 26:52.050
You can't stay here anymore.

26:52.052 --> 26:53.684
Okay, but where we going?

26:53.686 --> 26:55.752
Would you just put some
clothes on, already?

26:55.754 --> 26:57.788
Come on.

27:01.126 --> 27:02.425
Hey, Danny.

27:03.896 --> 27:05.896
You got an extra 50?

27:07.633 --> 27:10.100
Hey, boss.
We got one under.

27:10.102 --> 27:11.400
Officer Reagan.

27:11.402 --> 27:12.735
I want to speak with you now.

27:12.737 --> 27:13.936
How can I help you?

27:13.938 --> 27:15.605
This little girl you bring
by my house before.

27:15.607 --> 27:16.973
What is your relation to her?

27:16.975 --> 27:18.941
I don't see how that's
any of your business.

27:18.943 --> 27:20.676
She left this, her phone number.

27:20.678 --> 27:23.045
- In my home.
- All right, calm down.

27:23.047 --> 27:24.614
I want you to give her
a message from me.

27:24.616 --> 27:26.616
I'm not your personal
delivery service!

27:26.618 --> 27:28.282
You tell her

27:28.284 --> 27:30.284
that if she comes by my house
one more time,

27:30.286 --> 27:34.089
it will not be good
for her or you.

27:34.091 --> 27:36.057
You're stepping up pretty close
to the line, sir.

27:36.059 --> 27:38.126
No, you are coming
too close to the line!

27:38.128 --> 27:40.495
This is harassment.

27:40.497 --> 27:42.263
I told you, I know my rights.

27:42.265 --> 27:45.165
You make sure she does, too.

27:53.809 --> 27:55.442
Rodney Beckett?

27:57.179 --> 27:58.545
Who wants to know?

27:58.547 --> 28:01.148
Lieutenant Gormley, NYPD.

28:01.150 --> 28:02.849
You're not an easy man to find.

28:02.851 --> 28:06.318
I haven't used
the name Beckett in 12 years.

28:06.320 --> 28:07.887
And I haven't
had nothing to do

28:07.889 --> 28:09.455
with the police in even longer.

28:09.457 --> 28:12.725
It involves an old case
of my boss, Frank Reagan.

28:12.727 --> 28:16.029
That's another name
I don't like to think about.

28:17.165 --> 28:19.131
See this?

28:19.133 --> 28:22.567
That's my Frank Reagan story.

28:22.569 --> 28:24.836
This happened because of him.

28:24.838 --> 28:27.305
We could use your assistance.

28:27.307 --> 28:28.907
Heard that before.

28:28.909 --> 28:30.876
Right before the cuffs go on.

28:30.878 --> 28:33.912
It's a respectful
request, not a demand.

28:33.914 --> 28:36.413
Frank Reagan
is asking me for help?

28:36.415 --> 28:38.348
Seriously?
Yeah.

28:39.318 --> 28:41.652
Lord, thank you for keeping me

28:41.654 --> 28:44.354
alive to see this day.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.966
So, uh...

28:56.968 --> 29:00.170
You talked to the guys and
you straightened it out, right?

29:00.172 --> 29:01.470
I did what I could.

29:01.472 --> 29:02.572
Well, what'd they say?

29:02.574 --> 29:03.840
What do you
think they said?

29:03.842 --> 29:05.474
You know, Jimmy, you
put me in a bad spot.

29:05.476 --> 29:06.810
You put me in
a bad spot

29:06.812 --> 29:08.611
with my family, with my job.

29:08.613 --> 29:09.812
Wh-wh-what are you telling me,
Danny?

29:09.814 --> 29:10.913
You couldn't get me out of this?

29:10.915 --> 29:12.347
I'm not gonna lie to you.

29:12.349 --> 29:13.548
It's not good.

29:13.550 --> 29:15.984
What do you mean,
“it's not good”?

29:15.986 --> 29:17.485
Am I about to get clipped?

29:23.194 --> 29:24.893
Oh, man.

29:26.163 --> 29:28.963
So now what? You just, you just
gonna hand me over to them?

29:31.034 --> 29:33.167
Okay, okay, okay.

29:33.169 --> 29:34.736
Just give me a minute.

29:34.738 --> 29:36.771
Take all the time you want.

29:36.773 --> 29:39.173
Danny. I'm just asking, is there
nothing else we could do?

29:40.176 --> 29:41.809
Anything?

29:49.351 --> 29:51.517
Get down.

29:56.992 --> 29:58.992
Stay down.

30:01.328 --> 30:03.162
All right.

30:05.032 --> 30:06.198
Oh, man.

30:06.200 --> 30:08.100
This is what's gonna happen.

30:08.102 --> 30:10.369
I'm taking you to the airport,
I'm putting you

30:10.371 --> 30:12.537
on the last flight out of town,
I'm gonna give you a few bucks,

30:12.539 --> 30:15.741
and you're gonna start
a new life somewhere else.

30:16.644 --> 30:18.910
And leave you and my kid sister

30:18.912 --> 30:20.645
to clean up after me again?

30:22.215 --> 30:25.116
No. No, no, Danny.

30:25.118 --> 30:26.550
Take me back.

30:26.552 --> 30:29.053
Jimmy, would you just shut your
mouth for once in your life?

30:29.055 --> 30:30.321
No, when we walked into
Owl's Head park that day,

30:30.323 --> 30:31.689
I said we were brothers.

30:31.691 --> 30:33.925
Well, it's a good thing Larry
and the rest didn't show up.

30:33.927 --> 30:35.525
No. I'm not gonna leave
two goons sitting out front

30:35.527 --> 30:37.527
of your house every night
waiting for me to come back.

30:37.529 --> 30:38.208
Jimmy.

30:38.232 --> 30:39.330
No. I'm not
gonna do it, Danny.

30:39.331 --> 30:40.397
- Just stop.
-No.

30:40.399 --> 30:41.965
I'm not gonna do it.
Turn back.

30:41.967 --> 30:43.133
Turn around.

30:43.135 --> 30:44.367
You want me to turn around?

30:44.369 --> 30:45.568
I want you to turn around.

30:45.570 --> 30:47.204
You want to go back?

30:48.707 --> 30:51.108
Yeah. I want to go back.

30:51.110 --> 30:53.276
All right.

30:53.278 --> 30:54.743
I'm gonna go back.

30:58.183 --> 31:00.216
Hey, Danny.

31:00.218 --> 31:02.151
How bad is it gonna be?

31:02.153 --> 31:05.221
You're not gonna die tonight,
if that's what you're thinking.

31:07.892 --> 31:10.725
That's something.

31:10.727 --> 31:12.928
All right, moment of truth.

31:12.930 --> 31:14.162
Hey.

31:15.265 --> 31:17.032
Still got time to change
your mind.

31:17.034 --> 31:19.801
I'll put you on a flight
to Florida right now.

31:21.671 --> 31:23.839
Nah, I got to do this, Danny.

31:23.841 --> 31:25.373
You know me, six months

31:25.375 --> 31:28.475
from now, I'll be back here
in trouble all over again.

31:30.012 --> 31:33.613
Did you tell them
to go easy on my teeth?

31:33.615 --> 31:35.415
I've always had nice teeth.

31:39.788 --> 31:41.621
All right.

31:46.761 --> 31:48.928
I love you, bro.

32:14.148 --> 32:16.449
Jamie, did that lady
Nada ever show up?

32:17.123 --> 32:18.996
No, but her husband
was here earlier

32:18.997 --> 32:20.237
with a little
too much to say.

32:20.238 --> 32:21.403
I made a terrible mistake.

32:21.405 --> 32:22.739
Nada just called me screaming.

32:22.741 --> 32:24.706
They had a fight after the
last time we were over there.

32:24.708 --> 32:25.974
She told me to
come here, but

32:25.976 --> 32:27.275
I couldn't understand
what she was saying.

32:27.277 --> 32:29.310
I don't know anything about it.

32:29.312 --> 32:30.512
Jamie, you better get her

32:30.514 --> 32:32.681
out of here.
It's about to get really ugly.

32:32.683 --> 32:33.715
What?

32:33.717 --> 32:35.083
Where are you going?

32:35.085 --> 32:36.952
Where are you taking my son?

32:36.954 --> 32:39.320
Mom? Mom? Mom?
Ma'am? Ma'am?

32:39.322 --> 32:40.355
Whoa, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:40.357 --> 32:41.288
Mom. Mom.
We will explain everything

32:41.290 --> 32:42.356
to you when we get to the

32:42.358 --> 32:43.691
juvenile room.

32:43.693 --> 32:44.659
Come on.

32:44.661 --> 32:46.326
Come on.
You!

32:46.328 --> 32:48.062
This is all your fault!

32:48.064 --> 32:49.697
Why couldn't you
leave us alone?

32:49.699 --> 32:51.632
I don't understand, Nada.
What happened?

32:51.634 --> 32:53.534
My husband attacked
me after you left.

32:53.536 --> 32:55.903
He beat me till my
son had to defend me!

32:55.905 --> 32:57.971
Now my husband is
stabbed, in the hospital,

32:57.973 --> 33:00.106
and my son is under arrest.

33:00.108 --> 33:02.042
He is 12-- 12!

33:02.044 --> 33:04.177
Oh, my God, I am so sorry.

33:04.179 --> 33:06.445
No! You stay away!

33:06.447 --> 33:09.049
Stupid girl!
You've done enough!

33:45.785 --> 33:49.019
He's got four broken ribs,

33:49.021 --> 33:52.155
a collapsed lung
and a concussion.

33:53.959 --> 33:58.394
Well... CAT scan
came back okay, so...

33:58.396 --> 34:00.597
that's good news.

34:03.102 --> 34:05.035
Did you know?

34:05.037 --> 34:06.534
Did I know what?

34:06.558 --> 34:07.704
Don't play
with me, Danny.

34:07.705 --> 34:09.871
Did you know
this was gonna happen?

34:09.873 --> 34:11.505
Linda, I'm a cop.

34:11.507 --> 34:12.942
That's not an answer.

34:12.944 --> 34:15.377
You knew where he was.

34:15.379 --> 34:18.280
You dropped him off
at that motel he was staying at.

34:18.282 --> 34:20.681
I always told you there
were gonna be things

34:20.684 --> 34:23.384
that I would never be
able to talk about.

34:23.386 --> 34:26.587
But this time I need to know.

34:26.589 --> 34:29.724
What you need to know is

34:29.726 --> 34:32.460
that your brother's alive,

34:32.462 --> 34:35.063
and your family is safe.

34:35.065 --> 34:38.733
And that's really
all that matters right now.

34:40.534 --> 34:45.472
You understand that the purpose
of this hearing is to challenge

34:45.474 --> 34:47.440
your department's refusal

34:47.442 --> 34:50.978
to release officers'
disciplinary records, don't you?

34:50.980 --> 34:52.246
It is my understanding

34:52.248 --> 34:54.982
that state law prevents me
from releasing them.

34:54.984 --> 34:56.116
Yeah, but you can

34:56.118 --> 34:57.349
make an exception, can't you?

34:57.351 --> 34:58.985
In certain cases.
And yet,

34:58.987 --> 35:00.987
you consistently choose not to.

35:00.989 --> 35:02.488
Why is that?

35:02.490 --> 35:05.457
I choose
to protect my officers' privacy.

35:05.459 --> 35:08.094
Most complaints
are unsubstantiated.

35:08.096 --> 35:09.862
Well, you know
I'm only asking you

35:09.864 --> 35:11.063
about substantiated complaints.

35:11.065 --> 35:13.399
The vast majority
of all complaints

35:13.401 --> 35:15.700
are second-guessing
over minor matters.

35:15.702 --> 35:18.369
And we're supposed
to take your word for it.

35:18.371 --> 35:19.671
Why?

35:19.673 --> 35:21.139
Because you have
the power of the state,

35:21.141 --> 35:22.941
and the state
always knows best?

35:22.943 --> 35:24.309
I didn't say that.

35:24.311 --> 35:26.044
No? Then what would you say?

35:26.046 --> 35:28.013
That it's part of my job

35:28.015 --> 35:30.215
to exercise my judgment
as I see fit.

35:30.217 --> 35:32.649
So your officers always get
the benefit of the doubt.

35:32.651 --> 35:34.185
When it is merited.
Why?

35:34.187 --> 35:36.020
Just because
they carry a gun and

35:36.022 --> 35:37.254
wear a badge?

35:37.256 --> 35:39.790
Because they routinely make
split-second decisions

35:39.792 --> 35:43.194
under the most difficult
circumstances.

35:43.196 --> 35:46.163
Don't you have
a more personal reason

35:46.165 --> 35:50.766
for blocking the release
of these disciplinary reports?

35:54.572 --> 35:56.272
I do not.
You do not?

35:56.274 --> 35:58.908
Isn't it true
that you yourself

35:58.910 --> 36:03.246
were disciplined more than once
while you were a police officer

36:03.248 --> 36:07.182
in proceedings that
were not public until now?

36:07.184 --> 36:08.717
Your Honor,

36:08.719 --> 36:10.118
we object.

36:10.120 --> 36:13.455
It is not clear what proceedings
Mr. Guerrero is referring to.

36:13.457 --> 36:17.192
Your Honor, these records
were given to my office

36:17.194 --> 36:21.529
by a complainant
in the original action.

36:23.442 --> 36:24.814
It's a hearing.
I'll allow you

36:24.815 --> 36:27.349
to ask about them... for now.

36:31.683 --> 36:33.316
Commissioner Reagan,

36:34.686 --> 36:36.283
do you recall being disciplined

36:36.284 --> 36:38.584
for the use of excessive force

36:39.033 --> 36:42.200
against one Rodney Beckett?

36:45.305 --> 36:47.271
Yes.

36:47.273 --> 36:51.610
A third party who witnessed
the incident filed a complaint.

36:51.612 --> 36:54.646
And when you spoke
to that third party

36:54.648 --> 36:57.214
for purposes of this hearing,

36:57.216 --> 36:59.383
he confirmed it.

37:01.253 --> 37:05.890
Did you also speak
to the aggrieved party?

37:07.994 --> 37:10.828
His whereabouts are unknown.

37:10.830 --> 37:13.530
Well, it would be useful
to hear his account.

37:13.532 --> 37:15.798
Would that we could.

37:15.800 --> 37:18.768
You can.

37:18.770 --> 37:21.004
He's here.

37:23.174 --> 37:25.508
Mr. Beckett?

37:35.886 --> 37:40.221
Mr. Beckett is here
of his own volition

37:40.223 --> 37:43.025
and is willing to testify
as to what happened.

37:43.027 --> 37:44.693
- No. Your Honor, I object to this...
- Mr. Beckett

37:44.695 --> 37:47.862
has also thoughtfully provided
an affidavit that states

37:47.864 --> 37:49.263
that he was on PCP

37:49.265 --> 37:53.400
and fell down the stairs
accidentally.

37:55.071 --> 37:57.872
Mr. Beckett.

38:05.080 --> 38:07.280
Thank you, Your Honor.

38:12.588 --> 38:14.054
How's the arm, Rodney?

38:14.056 --> 38:17.490
Still can't straighten
it all the way.

38:17.492 --> 38:20.827
And it still hurts
when it's about to rain.

38:21.662 --> 38:24.162
It was good of you
to come to court.

38:24.164 --> 38:26.164
Didn't do it for you.

38:26.166 --> 38:28.266
Did it for me.

38:28.268 --> 38:32.304
To show I'm not the man I was.

38:35.743 --> 38:38.343
For what it's worth,
you did the right thing.

38:40.413 --> 38:42.847
Will you accept my thanks?

38:44.651 --> 38:48.352
Just be careful of the elbow.

38:57.129 --> 38:59.329
How much did that cost you?

38:59.331 --> 39:01.531
Not as much as
you think, Gerry.

39:01.533 --> 39:04.034
Come on. You must have
had some leverage.

39:04.036 --> 39:05.936
It was his choice
to come to court,

39:05.938 --> 39:09.039
just as it was your choice to
tip your hand ahead of time.

39:09.041 --> 39:11.742
Okay, okay.
Okay, you got me there.

39:11.744 --> 39:15.144
But it doesn't mean I'm wrong
about the bigger issue.

39:15.146 --> 39:17.279
The public has a right to know

39:17.281 --> 39:20.315
if you're shielding officers
with prior bad acts.

39:20.317 --> 39:22.451
The sergeant
who clothes-lined your client

39:22.453 --> 39:24.286
has been assigned modified duty

39:24.288 --> 39:27.690
and been encouraged
to seek opportunities elsewhere.

39:27.692 --> 39:29.858
You do see things
my way, Commissioner.

39:29.860 --> 39:31.826
No.

39:31.828 --> 39:36.097
But we take care of our own,
and that sword cuts both ways.

39:37.100 --> 39:38.833
And one more thing, Gerry,

39:38.835 --> 39:41.469
and I mean this in
the most helpful way.

39:41.471 --> 39:42.871
Yeah?

39:42.873 --> 39:45.073
Never assume that you know

39:45.075 --> 39:49.442
everything I know... about you.

40:07.162 --> 40:09.361
They pass a tax on talking?

40:09.363 --> 40:11.197
Yup. Twenty after.

40:11.199 --> 40:12.431
- What?
- Mom thinks

40:12.433 --> 40:13.733
when talk stops in a group,

40:13.735 --> 40:15.935
it's either 20 minutes before
or 20 minutes after the hour.

40:15.937 --> 40:17.103
It's true.

40:17.105 --> 40:18.537
Nah, that's bunk.

40:18.539 --> 40:22.174
Plus I see more long faces
than the finish line at Belmont.

40:22.176 --> 40:23.975
Some of us had a long week, Pop.

40:23.977 --> 40:25.253
Yeah, I'm pretty much
all talked out myself.

40:25.277 --> 40:26.579
Yeah, well, that's what happens

40:26.580 --> 40:28.246
when you talk out
of both sides of your mouth.

40:28.248 --> 40:30.015
What?
Ixnay.

40:30.017 --> 40:32.483
Nothing.
Thank you.

40:32.485 --> 40:33.885
Okay.

40:33.887 --> 40:35.053
So, Dad,

40:35.055 --> 40:36.221
how come none of us
ever heard

40:36.223 --> 40:37.622
that you got placed
on modified before?

40:37.624 --> 40:39.423
Yeah, Dad, how come?

40:39.425 --> 40:41.391
Oh, I can think
of a dozen good reasons.

40:41.393 --> 40:43.094
Because it was only people

40:43.096 --> 40:45.896
in the department that were
supposed to know about it.

40:45.898 --> 40:47.297
We're part of the
department, aren't we?

40:47.299 --> 40:48.799
At the time.

40:48.801 --> 40:50.000
And why is that?

40:50.002 --> 40:52.302
Because not everybody
can understand

40:52.304 --> 40:54.605
what we do and how we do it.

40:54.607 --> 40:56.339
It's easy to
armchair quarterback.

40:56.341 --> 40:58.875
It's a whole other thing
being in the arena.

40:58.877 --> 41:01.377
But shouldn't you have to answer
to somebody beside yourselves?

41:01.379 --> 41:03.479
Otherwise who keeps you honest?

41:03.481 --> 41:04.580
Yeah, what about that?

41:04.582 --> 41:06.382
Look, it's an
imperfect system

41:06.384 --> 41:08.451
run by imperfect
people, okay?

41:08.453 --> 41:10.720
Why does that excuse
never work for me?

41:11.789 --> 41:14.089
Well, do you really want us
to answer that?

41:14.091 --> 41:15.257
'Cause we try harder.

41:15.259 --> 41:18.260
