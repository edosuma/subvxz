[Clicking]

08:30.031 --> 08:32.773
Um, should I just wait
until it unfreezes?

08:32.816 --> 08:35.079
- Billion dollar company
and none of us can stop

08:35.123 --> 08:37.734
technology from cacking out,
am I right?

08:37.778 --> 08:39.736
- I'll get in touch with I.T.
- Okay.

08:39.780 --> 08:41.738
- What are you guys pumpin' in
here, pollen?

08:41.782 --> 08:44.611
Do you mind if I have some
of that water there, please.

08:44.654 --> 08:47.048
[Pitcher clanks]
- Jesus.
- Oh gosh!

08:47.091 --> 08:48.745
- Roland! What are you doing?
- What?

08:48.789 --> 08:50.530
- Why don't we take five, huh?
- Okay.

08:50.573 --> 08:52.488
- Don't worry.
We'll get this cleaned up.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.446
- Good.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Rose.

08:54.490 --> 08:55.839
- No, no need to apologize.

08:55.883 --> 08:58.494
I think a quick five
would be a good idea.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.974
Here we go.

09:00.017 --> 09:01.541
Rolland: [Coughs]

09:02.454 --> 09:04.369
[Low hum of chatter]

09:04.413 --> 09:06.154
[Door opens and shuts]

09:06.197 --> 09:08.635
- [Gasp] Oh gals!

09:08.678 --> 09:10.593
You shouldn't have.

09:10.637 --> 09:13.640
Jocelyn, are we now
moonlighting as town crier?

09:13.683 --> 09:16.425
- Oh, no, Moira--
- Cheeky gawpus you.

09:16.468 --> 09:18.122
Yes, it's true.

09:18.166 --> 09:19.863
Our husbands,
at my husband's direction,

09:19.907 --> 09:23.084
are currently in New York City,

09:23.127 --> 09:26.609
vending their business
to the corporate cognizant.

09:26.653 --> 09:29.525
- Oh my gosh.
That's so exciting.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.093
I wonder if they'll go
to the M&Ms store?

09:32.136 --> 09:33.268
- Shall I?

09:33.311 --> 09:35.357
Hence our impending move

09:35.400 --> 09:37.838
to the Big Red Delicious.

09:37.881 --> 09:39.013
- Excuse me?

09:39.056 --> 09:41.711
- Moira, I haven't said
anything yet.

09:41.755 --> 09:44.235
- [Chuckles]
Why the festivities then?

09:44.279 --> 09:45.933
- Grace is moving to Elm
Valley.

09:45.976 --> 09:48.239
That's why the cake says
"Goodbye Grace".

09:49.545 --> 09:50.851
- Oh I-I...

09:50.894 --> 09:53.767
I thought you were singling out

09:53.810 --> 09:56.552
one of my notable attributes.

09:58.423 --> 10:00.338
Shh. Okay, we'll just smooth
things over

10:00.382 --> 10:01.949
until Grace arrives.

10:01.992 --> 10:05.213
- I-I'm right here.
- Yes you are!

10:05.256 --> 10:07.650
Grace! Our timorous grinagog.

10:07.694 --> 10:10.044
I think I'll miss you
most of all.

10:10.087 --> 10:11.915
- Moira, are you sure it
isn't a bit premature

10:11.959 --> 10:14.352
to be talking about
all of this?

10:14.396 --> 10:16.441
- No, don't you worry, Jocelyn.
Oh, you're kidding.

10:16.485 --> 10:18.879
No, John has decades
on these people.

10:18.922 --> 10:21.229
- Okay. Well, that makes me
feel a little bit better.

10:21.272 --> 10:22.752
I... I got a little concerned

10:22.796 --> 10:24.493
when I got this text
from Rolland,

10:24.536 --> 10:26.626
but obviously I'm just
reading into it so.

10:26.669 --> 10:28.279
- You've received
correspondence?

10:28.323 --> 10:30.673
What am I looking at?
A cartoon head exploding?

10:30.717 --> 10:33.502
- Oh. It looks like three
cartoon heads exploding.

10:33.545 --> 10:35.330
- Well, then they're blowing
people's minds.

10:35.373 --> 10:36.810
What's the concern?

10:36.853 --> 10:38.899
- It's just that usually when
Rollie sends that emoji

10:38.942 --> 10:40.901
it's like his head
is exploding.

10:40.944 --> 10:42.729
It's like he's in trouble.

10:42.772 --> 10:45.253
- Yeah. I get a lot of those
texts during council meetings.

10:45.296 --> 10:47.603
- No, listen to me, Jocelyn.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.911
The deal has to happen.
Because it has to.

10:50.954 --> 10:53.870
Because there is no
alternative.

10:53.914 --> 10:55.263
Okay?

10:55.306 --> 10:57.308
It's as simple as that.

10:57.352 --> 11:00.050
- You're gripping my wrist
very tightly, Moira.

11:00.094 --> 11:02.618
- Okay. Well, let's just
continue celebrating Grace.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.054
- What?
- I'm Grace.

11:04.098 --> 11:06.056
- I know.
But she's not... you're-

11:06.100 --> 11:07.928
you're not celebrating enough.
No.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.542
[Bell jingles over door]

11:13.585 --> 11:15.109
- [Exhales, coughs]

11:15.152 --> 11:16.806
- I don't think you
took long enough.

11:16.850 --> 11:19.113
- Okay, am I holding
a treat for you?

11:19.156 --> 11:20.723
- I don't know, are you?

11:20.767 --> 11:23.508
- No. But you can share
my muffin.

11:23.552 --> 11:25.336
- Seriously.
What took you so long?

11:25.380 --> 11:26.860
- Are you sitting down?

11:26.903 --> 11:28.557
- I mean, I'm-I'm clearly not.
What's up?

11:28.600 --> 11:30.037
- So as we all know,

11:30.080 --> 11:31.778
they are currently in New York
securing the deal.

11:31.821 --> 11:33.083
- They secured the deal?

11:33.127 --> 11:34.781
- They are there talking
to people in New York

11:34.824 --> 11:36.521
about securing the deal.

11:36.565 --> 11:39.046
Anyway, when the deal
goes through

11:39.089 --> 11:43.441
apparently their plan
is to move to New York.

11:43.485 --> 11:45.356
- Wait? Whose plan?
Your parents?

11:45.400 --> 11:47.228
- Yeah. And Alexis.

11:47.271 --> 11:49.752
- You seem awfully excited
for your family to move away?

11:49.796 --> 11:52.320
- We would be moving with them!

11:52.363 --> 11:53.974
- What?

11:54.017 --> 11:56.541
- Yeah. Alexis has already
short-listed apartments for us.

11:56.585 --> 11:58.456
One of them was featured
in season 3

11:58.500 --> 11:59.893
of "Sex and the City".

12:02.156 --> 12:04.071
- Wow.

12:04.114 --> 12:06.900
[Chuckle] Don't-I don't
know what to say.

12:06.943 --> 12:08.771
- I know.
It's a lot to process.

12:08.815 --> 12:10.599
I was overwhelmed at first
as well.

12:10.642 --> 12:13.123
- I mean, David,
our business is here.

12:13.167 --> 12:16.474
- Okay. What?
You-you don't wanna go?

12:16.518 --> 12:18.433
- Honestly? I don't know.
I--

12:18.476 --> 12:20.000
Like you're just telling me

12:20.043 --> 12:21.697
that you wanna uproot
our entire lives,

12:21.741 --> 12:23.786
and it's just throwing me
for a bit of a loop.

12:23.830 --> 12:27.442
- Okay. Well, you know,
at this point it's just talk.

12:27.485 --> 12:30.053
So there's a good chance that,
that the deal won't go through.

12:30.097 --> 12:33.361
In which case, you know this
was just a big waste of time

12:33.404 --> 12:35.015
and frown lines.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.758
I thought you'd be excited.

12:40.498 --> 12:42.370
Would half a muffin help?

12:42.413 --> 12:44.067
- I'm not sure.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.810
[Receding footsteps]

12:48.898 --> 12:51.596
- Okay. Y-you took it
so that's a good sign.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.207
[Floorboard creaks]

12:56.079 --> 12:59.430
- Look, we can't let this bumpy
start derail why we're here.

12:59.474 --> 13:01.302
And why are we here, Stevie?

13:01.345 --> 13:02.869
- Because we have an idea.

13:02.912 --> 13:04.566
- No. Because we have
a great idea.

13:04.609 --> 13:06.742
And they should be--

13:06.786 --> 13:08.526
- And they should be lucky
to have us.

13:08.570 --> 13:09.832
- Damn right.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.399
- Johnny, sorry to interrupt,

13:11.442 --> 13:12.922
but we're back up and running.

13:12.966 --> 13:14.184
- Oh, great.

13:15.533 --> 13:17.840
Okay. Let's do it.

13:17.884 --> 13:19.320
- So I came in two under par

13:19.363 --> 13:21.496
and that is with half
the course under water.

13:21.539 --> 13:23.541
It was-it ruined
the whole trip.

13:23.585 --> 13:26.457
Horrible. [Chuckles]
- What course?

13:26.501 --> 13:28.242
- Ocean Course on Kauai.

13:28.285 --> 13:29.765
- Ah, what hotel?

13:29.809 --> 13:31.680
- We got a villa
at the St. Regis.

13:31.723 --> 13:33.856
- Oh. Very nice. I've stayed
there quite a few times.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.858
- Hm.
- Now let me ask you,

13:35.902 --> 13:39.340
how many of you
have stayed in a motel?

13:40.907 --> 13:44.345
Well, motels are small hotels
without the golf courses

13:44.388 --> 13:45.868
in case you--

13:45.912 --> 13:47.696
- [Chuckles]
- Well, good-good-good.

13:47.739 --> 13:49.698
So you're familiar at least.

13:49.741 --> 13:52.875
Now, when I say "motel",
what comes to mind?

13:52.919 --> 13:55.312
Uh, rundown? Unclean? Unsafe?

13:55.356 --> 13:57.749
- Yeah, that sounds about right.

13:57.793 --> 14:00.013
- Well, that's what I used
to think.

14:00.056 --> 14:03.407
I always saw motels
as a last resort,

14:03.451 --> 14:04.539
a dreaded pit stop.

14:04.582 --> 14:07.716
But I was wrong.

14:07.759 --> 14:11.502
Motels have the potential
of offering a window

14:11.546 --> 14:14.157
into the unique charm

14:14.201 --> 14:15.898
of small town life.

14:15.942 --> 14:18.640
And that's exactly what
the Rosebud Motel Group

14:18.683 --> 14:20.381
plans to do.

14:20.424 --> 14:21.904
Open that window

14:21.948 --> 14:24.907
and revitalize the classic
roadside motel

14:24.951 --> 14:26.648
for a new generation.
[Slide chimes]

14:28.171 --> 14:30.608
Turns out,
a couple of coats of paint

14:30.652 --> 14:32.697
and dusting off some
mid-century furniture

14:32.741 --> 14:34.351
can go a long way.

14:34.395 --> 14:35.918
- That's right.

14:35.962 --> 14:38.616
We've seen a 400% increase
in occupancy

14:38.660 --> 14:40.618
since we started marketing.

14:40.662 --> 14:42.272
And cleaning.

14:42.316 --> 14:44.753
- And if this is what
we can do with one motel,

14:44.796 --> 14:48.670
just imagine what we
can do with 10,000.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.978
I'm not coming to you
for charity here,

14:52.021 --> 14:53.980
I'm coming to you
with an opportunity.

14:54.023 --> 14:57.244
There is value in these motels.

14:57.287 --> 15:00.116
And if you're wondering
how I'm so sure...

15:01.291 --> 15:02.945
[Slide chimes]

15:02.989 --> 15:05.208
My family and I have been
staying in a motel

15:05.252 --> 15:07.123
for the past three years.

15:09.256 --> 15:12.041
And I wouldn't trade our stay
there for anything.

15:13.260 --> 15:16.263
That's how strongly
I believe in this idea.

15:16.306 --> 15:18.091
As Stevie can attest,

15:18.134 --> 15:20.571
if my family can find peace
and comfort

15:20.615 --> 15:23.444
staying at a motel,
anyone can.

15:23.487 --> 15:26.012
And I can only wish
that one day soon

15:26.055 --> 15:29.580
you and your families
can experience the love

15:29.624 --> 15:31.626
and simple pleasures

15:31.669 --> 15:34.063
that come with staying
even for one night...

15:35.369 --> 15:37.980
at a Rosebud Motel.

15:38.024 --> 15:40.461
[All in unison]
Where every stay

15:40.504 --> 15:42.767
feels like home.

15:43.768 --> 15:46.119
- Thank you for your time.

15:46.162 --> 15:48.208
[Whispers]
- I think that's great.

15:52.299 --> 15:54.649
- [Excited] Mr. Rose,
that was so good.

15:54.692 --> 15:56.477
Did you see their faces?

15:56.520 --> 15:58.174
I mean, I think-I think they
liked it.

15:58.218 --> 16:00.089
- Johnny, even I was impressed,

16:00.133 --> 16:02.091
and I thought you had blown it
for all of us.

16:02.135 --> 16:03.963
[Chuckles]
- Didn't you have a briefcase?

16:04.006 --> 16:06.487
- See this is what happens
when Johnny impresses me.

16:06.530 --> 16:08.445
I get confused and I forget
what I'm doing.

16:08.489 --> 16:10.491
- What was in that briefcase
anyway?

16:10.534 --> 16:12.362
- Nothing. You told me to look
intimidating.

16:12.406 --> 16:14.103
So I brought a briefcase.

16:14.147 --> 16:16.192
I'll go get it.
I'll meet you guys downstairs.

16:16.236 --> 16:18.325
- Mr. Rose, you were so good.

16:18.368 --> 16:20.980
Bryce: [Laughs] First a video
store, now a motel chain.

16:21.023 --> 16:23.069
What? He wants to
reinvent the pager next?

16:23.112 --> 16:24.679
[All laughing]

16:26.507 --> 16:28.509
[Room quiets down]

16:28.552 --> 16:30.641
- [Clears his throat]

16:31.251 --> 16:33.818
- I uh... forgot my briefcase.

16:33.862 --> 16:35.777
- Don't wanna forget that.
[Chuckles]

16:35.820 --> 16:37.431
[Briefcase thuds]

16:37.474 --> 16:39.650
- Do you people know what
it took for Johnny Rose

16:39.694 --> 16:41.391
to come back and do this?

16:41.435 --> 16:43.567
After being away
for all that time?

16:44.873 --> 16:48.137
Shame on you.
Shame on all of you.

16:51.314 --> 16:53.229
Okay. I just realized you
guys are flying us home.

16:53.273 --> 16:55.666
So I apologize for my outburst,

16:55.710 --> 16:58.017
but I don't regret it.

16:59.105 --> 17:01.020
The man's a legend.

17:05.067 --> 17:06.503
[Door opens and shuts]

17:09.115 --> 17:10.594
- Family!

17:12.161 --> 17:14.076
- What's going on?
- Nothing is going on, David.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.122
I'm just worried
about your father.

17:16.165 --> 17:17.993
I don't believe the two of you
were encouraging enough

17:18.037 --> 17:19.473
before he left.

17:19.516 --> 17:21.823
- I made him a card.
- And I said "take care".

17:21.866 --> 17:23.564
- We need to do something.

17:23.607 --> 17:25.783
Send some energy his way.

17:25.827 --> 17:27.524
Hands, children.

17:27.568 --> 17:28.830
- What's going on?

17:28.873 --> 17:30.179
- Perhaps we should kneel.

17:30.223 --> 17:32.355
- Okay. You're scaring me.
- Please.

17:32.399 --> 17:33.835
- Hm.

17:33.878 --> 17:36.359
- [Sighs]

17:36.403 --> 17:37.926
- Ow!
- Ooh.

17:37.969 --> 17:39.101
- Okay, are we praying?

17:39.145 --> 17:40.842
- Don't be ridiculous.

17:40.885 --> 17:42.670
To Whom It May Concern:

17:42.713 --> 17:45.064
There's a man out there,
my husband,

17:45.107 --> 17:47.370
he's out there trying to build
back what we've lost.

17:47.414 --> 17:50.069
And... I'm sorry; 5'10',
slow talker--

17:50.112 --> 17:51.940
- Okay. I think they get it.

17:51.983 --> 17:54.116
- It's our turn
to send him abetment.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.031
- It's just that this is
feeling a bit desperate.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.337
- Can we do this
without holding hands?

17:57.380 --> 17:59.295
- No! He's worked so hard
while the rest of us

17:59.339 --> 18:00.905
have just been flailing about.

18:00.949 --> 18:02.907
- I don't think
that's accurate.

18:02.951 --> 18:04.909
- Absolutely not the case.
- I implore you...

18:04.953 --> 18:06.520
please forward the following;

18:06.563 --> 18:09.088
John. My macho man.

18:09.131 --> 18:11.612
You don't deserve
another failure.

18:11.655 --> 18:13.004
- Oh.

18:13.048 --> 18:14.397
- Okay. What is happening?

18:14.441 --> 18:16.573
- I don't know, David,
just go with it.

18:16.617 --> 18:19.228
John, we're here for you.

18:23.972 --> 18:26.322
Oh, Alexis your hands
as dry as an autumn leaf.

18:26.366 --> 18:28.150
- Eww.
- Shh.

18:30.021 --> 18:31.980
- Well, I'm just happy
it's over, Stevie.

18:32.023 --> 18:33.938
Those rooms are never easy,

18:33.982 --> 18:35.723
but you were right there
when I needed you.

18:35.766 --> 18:37.768
- Okay, I got my briefcase,

18:37.812 --> 18:39.466
Let's go. Where is the car?

18:39.509 --> 18:41.381
- Well, we still have
a few minutes, Rolland.

18:41.424 --> 18:43.818
We finished early,
the car is not here yet.

18:43.861 --> 18:46.386
I can't wait to pop some
champagne on that plane.

18:46.429 --> 18:48.953
We can finally start
enjoying ourselves.

18:48.997 --> 18:52.000
- Um, Johnny, let's not jump
the gun just yet, okay?

18:52.043 --> 18:54.002
- Mr. Rose.
- Ruth.

18:54.045 --> 18:56.047
Did we forget something else?

18:56.091 --> 18:58.267
- Uh Ruth, we don't need
to be ushered out,

18:58.311 --> 19:00.182
we know where the door is.
Come on, guys.

19:00.226 --> 19:01.966
- I just wanted to come out

19:02.010 --> 19:03.838
and personally thank you
for your pitch.

19:03.881 --> 19:05.709
- Well, you're welcome.

19:05.753 --> 19:08.843
It felt like we really turned
things around in there.

19:08.886 --> 19:11.193
- You certainly did.
But between us,

19:11.237 --> 19:13.152
they won't be moving
forward with the idea.

19:13.195 --> 19:15.328
- How can they even decide
that fast?

19:15.371 --> 19:16.416
- It's okay, Stevie.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.809
- They've turned down
a thousand good ideas.

19:18.853 --> 19:21.334
I was in the room when
they passed on Uber.

19:21.377 --> 19:23.205
- Well...
- [Scoffs]

19:24.554 --> 19:26.382
- I guess, I guess that's it.

19:26.426 --> 19:29.820
- I really shouldn't be saying
this on company soil,

19:29.864 --> 19:31.474
but two of the junior
partners and I

19:31.518 --> 19:33.563
are in the process of starting
our own firm.

19:33.607 --> 19:36.087
We've got the team,
we've secured the capital,

19:36.131 --> 19:38.177
and we're planning on
launching next month,

19:38.220 --> 19:40.483
and this is exactly
the kind of project

19:40.527 --> 19:42.311
we're hoping to get behind.

19:42.355 --> 19:44.922
- Maybe I should wait
to hear from Mike first.

19:44.966 --> 19:47.664
- Johnny, I think you should
listen to her.

19:47.708 --> 19:49.840
Believe me,
those people up there,

19:49.884 --> 19:52.974
they don't deserve to be
in business with you.

19:53.017 --> 19:54.628
- Mr. Rose, I don't know,

19:54.671 --> 19:57.326
I feel like I'm getting
a good vibe from her.

19:58.762 --> 20:00.199
- We would love
to take you for lunch

20:00.242 --> 20:01.983
and hear more
about your proposal.

20:02.026 --> 20:04.115
[Traffic whooshes, cars honk]

20:11.427 --> 20:14.300
- Okay, I hear another vehicle.
Heavier tread.

20:14.343 --> 20:16.998
- Oh my God. They're gonna get
here when they get here.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.958
[Dog barks]

20:21.002 --> 20:23.613
- Is that... could that be theirlimousine?

20:25.659 --> 20:27.269
- That's them!

20:27.313 --> 20:29.663
- Oh, your father's insistence
on telling us in person

20:29.706 --> 20:31.969
could so go either way.

20:32.013 --> 20:34.276
This threat of failure
is inhumane.

20:34.320 --> 20:35.277
Jocelyn: No, I think
it's exciting.

20:35.321 --> 20:37.018
It's like "Deal or No Deal",

20:37.061 --> 20:39.194
but with the rest of our
lives.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.022
[Doors open and shut]

20:46.549 --> 20:48.159
- [Sighs]

20:49.944 --> 20:52.033
- John! No!

20:52.076 --> 20:53.600
[Alexis squeals happily]

20:53.643 --> 20:56.211
[All laughing, cheering]

20:58.605 --> 21:00.302
[All laughing]

21:02.043 --> 21:04.306
- So you're like
a businesswoman now.

21:04.350 --> 21:06.308
- Damn right I am.

21:06.352 --> 21:08.919
- I sealed the deal.
It was really me.

21:08.963 --> 21:10.834
- Oh my God!
- We did it!

21:10.878 --> 21:12.836
We all did it!

21:12.880 --> 21:15.274
- Champagne! Champagne for all!

21:15.317 --> 21:18.712
- We only have Zampagne.
- Zampagne for all!

21:18.755 --> 21:21.149
- Yes!
[Happy laughter]
