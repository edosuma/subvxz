WEBVTT

00:05.706 --> 00:08.109
*

00:09.077 --> 00:11.712
* Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh *

00:11.745 --> 00:13.747
* Ah-ooh... ah-ooh... *

00:15.216 --> 00:17.351
Oh, that was fun.

00:17.385 --> 00:20.354
Fun ain't the half of it.

00:20.388 --> 00:24.692
Come to New Orleans
for a wedding.

00:24.725 --> 00:27.195
Meet a nice Southern
boy in a bar.

00:27.228 --> 00:29.130
Have a little
bit of fun.

00:29.163 --> 00:30.831
You know,

00:30.864 --> 00:32.600
I have a thing for
romance novels,

00:32.633 --> 00:34.502
and they got
nothing on this.

00:37.171 --> 00:39.540
Oh. St. Christopher medal?

00:39.573 --> 00:41.309
Yup.

00:41.342 --> 00:43.811
I like it.

00:43.844 --> 00:46.514
* I tried and I tried
to run and hide *

00:46.547 --> 00:48.349
* I even tried to run away...

00:48.382 --> 00:51.719
I got to go.
Oh. Oh.

00:51.752 --> 00:53.754
* You just can't run
from the funnel of love... *
Oh.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.558
Oh, I really did
have a nice time tonight.

00:57.591 --> 01:01.229
As did I...

01:01.262 --> 01:03.231
Beth.

01:05.433 --> 01:07.235
Beth.

01:11.405 --> 01:15.876
* Ah-ooh, ah-ooh, ah-ooh *

01:15.909 --> 01:18.879
* It's such a crazy,
crazy feeling *

01:18.912 --> 01:21.115
* I get weak in the knees

01:21.149 --> 01:23.884
* My poor old head
is a reelin' *

01:23.917 --> 01:26.587
* As I go deep
into the funnel of love... *

01:26.620 --> 01:28.756
MAN:
Yeah! All right. All right.

01:28.789 --> 01:31.292
I want to give a big salute

01:31.325 --> 01:33.261
to the newest member
of the Seabee Battalion.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.730
Alison!

01:38.366 --> 01:40.134
Okay, okay,
let's keep this party goin'

01:40.168 --> 01:42.836
with a little bouquet tossin'!

01:42.870 --> 01:44.572
Yes!

01:44.605 --> 01:46.774
Oh, my God...!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God... okay!

01:46.807 --> 01:48.842
Okay, ready?
All right.
Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait!

01:48.876 --> 01:51.279
Okay, okay, all right.
Okay, count of three, ready?

01:51.312 --> 01:55.283
ALL:
One, two, three!

01:58.886 --> 02:01.289
No.
I got it!

02:01.322 --> 02:04.492
I got it!

02:11.865 --> 02:14.368
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:14.402 --> 02:17.271
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

02:17.305 --> 02:19.407
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:19.440 --> 02:20.674
* How, how, how, how

02:20.708 --> 02:23.877
* Hey, hey

02:28.916 --> 02:30.418
* You gotta come on.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.295
I hoped I'd
find you here.

02:41.329 --> 02:43.764
Set aside Saturdays
to update the electrics.

02:43.797 --> 02:45.299
How's it going?

02:45.333 --> 02:46.734
Almost killed myself twice.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.402
Thought a break
would be in order.

02:48.436 --> 02:51.372
Well, I brought you a snack--
dump truck fries.

02:51.405 --> 02:53.441
And...

02:53.474 --> 02:54.808
a potential lady friend.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.277
She's a physical therapist.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.212
Doesn't like to cook,

02:58.246 --> 03:00.914
but loves a man who does.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.783
She was sitting
in a booth next to me

03:02.816 --> 03:04.218
at the Avenue Pub last night.

03:04.252 --> 03:05.686
Struck up a
conversation.

03:05.719 --> 03:08.256
Told her I had a real good man
for her to meet.

03:09.490 --> 03:11.859
Audrey Sapphire?

03:11.892 --> 03:13.961
She live in the Bywater?

03:13.994 --> 03:15.996
Family originally
from Shreveport?

03:16.029 --> 03:18.399
Sounds right.
Mm-hmm.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.836
Put her cousin away for burglary

03:22.870 --> 03:25.406
when I was back at JPSO.

03:25.439 --> 03:27.841
Appreciate the recon, Chris,

03:27.875 --> 03:30.244
but, unfortunately,

03:30.278 --> 03:32.746
every woman in this town
comes with baggage.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.448
Mine.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.686
I'm always watching out
for you, King.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.988
And I'm always
watching out for you.

03:41.021 --> 03:44.292
When's the last time you slept
in your own bed, Christopher?

03:44.325 --> 03:46.594
It's been a bit.
What's that about?

03:46.627 --> 03:49.397
It's about nothing.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.832
Tonight I'll sleep
in my own bed, I promise.

03:51.865 --> 03:54.602
Lights out at 10:00.

03:54.635 --> 03:57.405
I'm gonna hold you to that.

03:57.438 --> 04:00.274
Ah.

04:00.308 --> 04:02.443
Work.

04:02.476 --> 04:05.746
SONJA:
So here's the story.

04:05.779 --> 04:10.351
Bridesmaid ran the 40 for
the bouquet, found the victim.

04:10.384 --> 04:13.354
BRODY:
Bridesmaid dresses
are the devil's spawn.

04:13.387 --> 04:14.822
Awful, ugly.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.990
Impossible to get into,
even harder to get out of.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.992
Not as hard as you think.

04:21.695 --> 04:23.697
Last wedding

04:23.731 --> 04:26.367
I was in-- ten of us
in yellow, feathers.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.669
Looked like
a mutant canary threw up.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.003
Where can I get pictures?

04:30.037 --> 04:32.306
Don't answer that.
I won't, trust me.

04:32.340 --> 04:35.543
BRODY:
Our victim--
Lieutenant Max Griggs.

04:37.845 --> 04:40.514
He was a reservist assigned
to the Wentworth Air Force Base.

04:40.548 --> 04:41.849
Job's compartmented.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.016
Call his C.O.

04:43.050 --> 04:45.719
Get us read in? On it!

04:45.753 --> 04:47.488
PRIDE:
Loretta?

04:47.521 --> 04:51.425
Multiple stab wounds
to the abdomen.

04:51.459 --> 04:52.660
The amount of
blood suggests

04:52.693 --> 04:54.962
a severed artery,
and most likely,

04:54.995 --> 04:58.031
been unconscious five,
six seconds after the attack.

04:58.065 --> 05:01.769
Murder weapon?
Steak knife.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.471
Killer may have
been a guest, but

05:03.504 --> 05:05.339
victim doesn't look
dressed for a party.

05:05.373 --> 05:06.574
Jeans

05:06.607 --> 05:09.577
Maybe a date...
or a wedding crasher?

05:09.610 --> 05:11.745
Well, there's cameras
inside, and on the grounds,

05:11.779 --> 05:13.447
but there's nothing out here.

05:13.481 --> 05:14.648
Let me guess. No witnesses.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.584
Someone had
to have seen something.

05:17.585 --> 05:19.887
Let's learn things.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.656
Got no idea who
Lieutenant Griggs is.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.091
Don't recognize him?

05:24.124 --> 05:25.459
He's a Navy Reservist.
Ever crossed paths?

05:25.493 --> 05:27.060
No. Sorry.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.662
Most of the guests
were Seabees.

05:28.696 --> 05:30.498
Served with my husband?

05:30.531 --> 05:32.400
Could Griggs have been
someone's date?
No.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.502
I knew everyone
that was at the reception.

05:34.535 --> 05:35.836
I Googled all the plus ones.

05:35.869 --> 05:37.738
Then I handwrote a note
to each guest

05:37.771 --> 05:39.540
incorporating
something personal.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.442
Took me five months to complete.

05:41.475 --> 05:44.144
Okay.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.414
Do you like
how I decorated the car?

05:46.447 --> 05:49.517
Rosé-colored condoms.
They even smell like rosé.

05:49.550 --> 05:54.622
Copy that. So, did you see the
victim, anything suspicious?

05:54.655 --> 05:57.958
No, but... I think...

05:57.991 --> 06:00.528
that I drank
a little too much.

06:02.195 --> 06:06.700
All right, uh, if you
remember anything,

06:06.734 --> 06:09.937
even this
conversation, call.

06:09.970 --> 06:14.074
Loud music, lots of people
and a bunch of drunk guests.

06:14.107 --> 06:16.844
No wonder no one saw
or heard anything.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.447
Or someone's lying.

06:19.480 --> 06:22.883
Just got the call
from Griggs' C.O. at Wentworth.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.184
He's a drone pilot.

06:24.217 --> 06:27.421
Might be why
his job was classified.

06:27.455 --> 06:29.623
All right, Brody, Sonja,
lock down the wedding angle.

06:29.657 --> 06:32.526
Run guests and vendors,
find a connection.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.894
Chris, you're with me.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.463
Griggs' family
lives close.

06:35.496 --> 06:37.898
Let's go find out
what they know.

06:37.931 --> 06:41.469
WOMAN:
Max's job is supposed
to be a secret.

06:41.502 --> 06:44.572
Our neighbors don't even know
what he does.

06:44.605 --> 06:47.908
Our son...
thinks he has a day job on base.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.643
PRIDE:
Mrs. Griggs,

06:49.677 --> 06:52.946
do you have any idea what
Max was doing at this wedding?

06:52.980 --> 06:55.583
No.

06:55.616 --> 06:58.652
He... he never mentioned
anything about a wedding.

06:58.686 --> 07:00.454
How about the hotel?

07:00.488 --> 07:01.655
Did he have business

07:01.689 --> 07:02.790
in the area

07:02.823 --> 07:05.659
I... I thought he was at work.

07:05.693 --> 07:07.895
You weren't concerned
when he didn't come home?

07:07.928 --> 07:10.498
He works extended shifts
all the time.

07:10.531 --> 07:13.601
What's ironic-- when
Max flew with the Navy,

07:13.634 --> 07:16.970
he was gone... for months.

07:17.004 --> 07:19.573
Trained to be a drone pilot

07:19.607 --> 07:22.576
so he could spend more
quality time with us.

07:22.610 --> 07:25.946
But the military was short on
UAV operators, and Max...

07:32.786 --> 07:34.722
Especially hard on a kid.

07:34.755 --> 07:37.591
You have no idea
what they were like together.

07:43.631 --> 07:45.966
Ryan?

07:52.105 --> 07:55.843
I'm Agent Chris Lasalle.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.778
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

07:57.811 --> 08:02.616
Can I ask you
a few questions?

08:02.650 --> 08:07.588
When your dad dropped you off
at ball practice this morning,

08:07.621 --> 08:09.089
he say where he was going?

08:09.122 --> 08:11.692
My dad's a hero...

08:11.725 --> 08:13.994
no matter what people say.

08:17.197 --> 08:19.633
People say differently?

08:30.911 --> 08:33.313
Dad's hobby.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.716
Y'all work on it together?

08:35.749 --> 08:37.685
Used to.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.887
Couple of days ago,
he drove it home from work.

08:39.920 --> 08:42.590
I was in the garage
when he came in.

08:42.623 --> 08:45.559
He put the cover on it
'cause he didn't

08:45.593 --> 08:47.928
want my mom getting scared.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.707
My dad's a good man.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.274
He is.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.026
What do we know
about Lieutenant Griggs?

09:19.059 --> 09:22.029
Graduated top of
his class at NFWS,

09:22.062 --> 09:23.797
flew three tours in Iraq

09:23.831 --> 09:25.799
before returning stateside
to fly drones.

09:25.833 --> 09:28.636
Exemplary military record,
not a hint of stink on him.

09:28.669 --> 09:30.704
Any connects to the wedding?

09:30.738 --> 09:32.105
I ran backgrounds on everyone.

09:32.139 --> 09:33.674
Nothing matches up with Griggs.

09:33.707 --> 09:36.109
All's clean, basically.

09:36.143 --> 09:39.146
Basically?
Well, there were a couple
valets who got busted

09:39.179 --> 09:41.949
for pot possession, and
a caterer with, well...

09:41.982 --> 09:44.017
six counts of
public indecency.

09:44.051 --> 09:46.186
All the Seabees were spotless.

09:46.219 --> 09:50.658
Yeah, great. So our best...
and only lead is this car.

09:50.691 --> 09:51.825
Well, Sebastian's looking
into the paint,

09:51.859 --> 09:53.727
but given what Griggs does...

09:53.761 --> 09:55.829
Message could be connected
to his job as a drone pilot.

09:55.863 --> 09:57.130
BRODY:
Well, their identities

09:57.164 --> 09:58.699
are supposed to be kept secret,

09:58.732 --> 10:01.034
but Jihadists have been trying
to get the list.

10:01.068 --> 10:04.805
Intimidate the drone pilots,
limit what the military can do.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.740
Let's follow up
with Griggs' C.O.

10:06.774 --> 10:09.743
Let's see what
he was really up to.

10:09.777 --> 10:12.245
MAN:
If Griggs hadn't been killed,
he'd be running this op.

10:12.279 --> 10:15.082
WOMAN:
Entering surveillance
hour three.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.850
Target approaching.

10:19.753 --> 10:21.755
Rifling laser.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.726
Wait. There's a child.

10:26.794 --> 10:28.829
Non-combatants. Abort.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.898
MAN:
Being a drone pilot

10:30.931 --> 10:33.701
isn't easy, and Griggs
was as good as it gets.

10:33.734 --> 10:36.403
Navy fighter pilot
with combat experience.

10:36.436 --> 10:37.938
Invaluable asset.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.173
Navy reservist
at an Air Force Base?

10:40.207 --> 10:42.375
Did the necessary
training.

10:42.409 --> 10:45.813
UAV pilots like Griggs
are in short supply.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.915
Could have come from outer
space for all I care.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.950
Any chance
Jihadists got his name?

10:49.983 --> 10:52.052
Went back over the wires,
Agent Pride.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.287
Griggs' name wasn't leaked.

10:54.321 --> 10:57.324
How about... over coms
during a mission?

10:57.357 --> 10:59.793
Griggs followed protocol to a T,

10:59.827 --> 11:01.762
never would have let
something like that happen.

11:01.795 --> 11:04.464
You're not gonna find
any dirt on the guy.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.700
We're not trying
to accuse him of anything.

11:06.734 --> 11:11.038
We just want to know who did
this to Lieutenant Griggs' car.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.973
How'd you guys come in today?

11:13.006 --> 11:15.208
South entrance.

11:15.242 --> 11:17.310
You want to find out
who did that,

11:17.344 --> 11:19.379
leave by the public access road.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.286
PEOPLE :
Stop the drones!

11:26.319 --> 11:29.389
Stop the drones!
Stop the drones!

11:29.422 --> 11:32.225
Guess we can't stop people
from having an opinion.

11:32.259 --> 11:35.128
Opinion strong enough
to deface someone's car?

11:35.162 --> 11:36.830
Kill someone?

11:36.864 --> 11:39.232
Grab your phone.

11:42.269 --> 11:45.338
(phone camera chirping
and clicking)

11:45.372 --> 11:48.375
Vengeance is upon you!
Say cheese.

11:48.408 --> 11:51.879
Reminds me of the Quarter
on a Friday night.

11:51.912 --> 11:54.247
Cross-referencing the photos
of the protestors

11:54.281 --> 11:56.216
with the watch lists--
nothing so far.

11:56.249 --> 11:57.818
Me, neither.

11:57.851 --> 11:59.252
I found something on Facebook.

11:59.286 --> 12:00.420
Come check it out.

12:03.891 --> 12:07.060
Yeah, uh, Big Bird called,
and he wants his feathers back.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.328
Go ahead.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.463
Laugh it up.

12:10.497 --> 12:12.800
Actually, I'm kind of
into the feathers.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.435
You know, it gives it
a, uh, birdy class.

12:15.468 --> 12:17.805
Oh, you want to talk class?

12:17.838 --> 12:20.340
Nothing like leaving
your house keys

12:20.373 --> 12:22.742
in the hotel room
of your hook-up.

12:24.144 --> 12:27.815
Beth came by,
and she dropped these off.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.983
Did she?
Give 'em here.

12:30.017 --> 12:33.821
So, no keys? Where have you been
sleeping, Lasalle?

12:33.854 --> 12:35.488
You know what?

12:35.522 --> 12:37.958
I'm gonna call Wade
and Sebastian

12:37.991 --> 12:39.993
and see where they are
on the case.

12:40.027 --> 12:43.430
Good idea.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.966
What do you know
about the protestors?

12:45.999 --> 12:51.004
Well, no direct threat
to Griggs, but...

12:51.038 --> 12:55.008
these five made threats
against the drone pilots.

12:55.042 --> 12:56.910
Anything else to narrow it down?

12:56.944 --> 12:58.278
Sebastian's got something.

12:58.311 --> 13:00.213
He wants to show it to us.

13:00.247 --> 13:04.117
Hello. So, I, uh, deconstructed
the paint used on Griggs' car.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.253
The Mass Spec detected
strontium aluminate

13:06.286 --> 13:08.188
and several other
unique compounds,

13:08.221 --> 13:11.358
all of which led me
to Duran Duran.

13:11.391 --> 13:14.427
Well, I mean,
Duran Duran-inspired paint.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.897
Ultra green V10
glow-in-the-dark paint.

13:18.932 --> 13:22.936
Highly durable, but with
that sweet '80s kind of vibe.

13:22.970 --> 13:25.438
On it.

13:25.472 --> 13:28.876
Running the photos
from the protest against

13:28.909 --> 13:31.078
the NSA's terrorist watch list.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.881
See if I can tie them
to the paint.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.884
Here we go.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.421
Same paint was used
in a G2 protest last year

13:41.454 --> 13:43.556
to mark cops with bull's-eyes.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.225
Name?
Kevin Mitchell.

13:45.258 --> 13:46.860
Why you guys steal my thunder?

13:46.894 --> 13:49.396
Yeah. By all means, Big Bird,
please continue.

13:49.429 --> 13:50.630
Oh, finally. Someone else is

13:50.663 --> 13:52.132
getting called Big Bird
around here.

13:52.165 --> 13:55.068
Mitchell?

13:55.102 --> 13:56.369
Thank you.

13:56.403 --> 13:58.238
And he's got a long wrap sheet.

13:58.271 --> 14:00.974
But he just started a blog
called "DronesOrDie.com."

14:01.008 --> 14:03.543
LASALLE:
Maybe painting the side

14:03.576 --> 14:05.578
of Griggs' car wasn't enough
for him.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.380
PRIDE:
Let's find him,
pick him up.

14:07.414 --> 14:08.882
PRIDE:
Government's trying to keep

14:08.916 --> 14:10.250
the names of
drone pilots'

14:10.283 --> 14:12.219
out of the hands of
Jihadists, but you...

14:12.252 --> 14:15.889
you just want
to blow that up?

14:15.923 --> 14:17.257
Killing foreign nationals

14:17.290 --> 14:19.259
outside a war zone breaks
the Geneva Convention.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.561
What about murdering
a U.S. naval officer?

14:21.594 --> 14:26.266
You followed Griggs home,
you tagged his car,

14:26.299 --> 14:28.101
then you followed
him again.

14:28.135 --> 14:31.972
Two of you got into it at
the hotel for some reason.

14:32.005 --> 14:35.508
Look, I trailed him a
couple times to get his address

14:35.542 --> 14:37.945
for the Web site,
but I didn't kill him.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.579
If anything, I backed off.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.049
Why is that?

14:42.082 --> 14:44.051
Saw him sneaking around,

14:44.084 --> 14:45.953
delivering secret packages,

14:45.986 --> 14:47.420
going to his secret lair.

14:47.454 --> 14:48.555
Saw that.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.391
Tagged his car and bounced.

14:51.424 --> 14:55.062
Go back to the secret lair.

14:56.363 --> 14:57.697
BRODY:
Owner of the building

14:57.730 --> 15:00.133
said he paid
for the unit in cash.

15:00.167 --> 15:05.038
Guy buys a storage unit
and doesn't tell his wife?

15:05.072 --> 15:07.941
Question is...

15:10.177 --> 15:12.045
...why the secrecy?

15:14.014 --> 15:16.216
:
Hello.

15:19.019 --> 15:22.222
Aerial surveillance
of navy bases?

15:22.255 --> 15:25.158
BRODY:
Borders, access roads,

15:25.192 --> 15:28.328
security gates,
classified intelligence.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.697
Lot of people who'd pay top
dollar for this kind of intel.

15:30.730 --> 15:34.367
Good pilot, husband, father.

15:34.401 --> 15:38.105
Perfect cover...
for a spy.

15:52.319 --> 15:56.123
PRIDE:
Griggs was surveilling bases,
collecting classified documents.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.158
Delivering mysterious packages?

15:58.191 --> 15:59.459
If Mitchell's
to be believed.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.094
LASALLE:
Mitchell

16:01.128 --> 16:02.529
has an alibi.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.697
Anti-drone rally
the day of the wedding.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.566
Sounds like a ton of fun.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.201
Okay, how about this?

16:08.235 --> 16:10.270
Griggs meets an espionage
contact at the wedding.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.539
Maybe one of the Seabees
is bad. He's there

16:12.572 --> 16:15.175
to give them intel, but instead
of getting paid, he gets...

16:15.208 --> 16:16.176
Snuffed?

16:16.209 --> 16:19.212
Espionage and a wedding?

16:19.246 --> 16:21.114
Something doesn't add up.

16:21.148 --> 16:23.083
So, what we're saying is

16:23.116 --> 16:25.185
Griggs' used
a high-value Navy asset

16:25.218 --> 16:27.220
to take photographs
of bases in Louisiana?

16:27.254 --> 16:29.622
Except I don't think that's
what happened. Those photos--

16:29.656 --> 16:31.258
the ceiling's too low.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.326
Camera resolution--
it's just too high.

16:33.360 --> 16:36.396
Come... fly with me.

16:36.429 --> 16:40.133
Where is he going?

16:41.801 --> 16:44.304
Pictures you found in
the storage space weren't taken

16:44.337 --> 16:47.174
with the same kind of drones
that Griggs flew at work.

16:47.207 --> 16:50.243
They were taken with something
like this-- an Octocopter.

16:50.277 --> 16:51.544
Or Octodrone.

16:51.578 --> 16:54.581
Or Olive. Sort of
my pet name for it.

16:54.614 --> 16:56.383
Given the altitude
of the pictures,

16:56.416 --> 16:58.085
proximity to bases, I'm thinking

16:58.118 --> 16:59.386
Griggs flew a smaller drone

16:59.419 --> 17:01.821
than this,
but with the same technology.

17:01.854 --> 17:05.358
Tougher for traditional
security measures to detect?

17:05.392 --> 17:06.826
Yeah, these things have
sensors for everything

17:06.859 --> 17:08.495
from weather info to
analyzing the soil.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.097
They can even be armed.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.399
If Griggs wasn't using
military drones,

17:12.432 --> 17:14.367
then whose drones
was he using?

17:14.401 --> 17:16.403
I put feelers out
in the nerd underground.

17:16.436 --> 17:18.271
And I found some locals

17:18.305 --> 17:20.507
who are selling undetectable
drones on the black market.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.443
These entrepreneurs
have names?

17:23.476 --> 17:26.113
LASALLE:
Steve Wilensky and Steve Dunn.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.281
Both 19, college drop-outs,
arrested

17:28.315 --> 17:30.283
for violating FAA airspace.
Watch lists

17:30.317 --> 17:32.452
for selling drones to
foreign governments.

17:32.485 --> 17:36.289
If they sold to Griggs, maybe
they know who he was spying for.

17:36.323 --> 17:37.857
Don't know he was spying yet.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.559
Secret aerial surveillance

17:39.592 --> 17:42.095
of U.S. bases
and undetectable drones?

17:42.129 --> 17:44.264
What's your definition
of spying?

17:44.297 --> 17:49.136
Proof. You promised me you
were going home last night.

17:49.169 --> 17:50.637
It's tough to do
without keys.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.639
Where were you?

17:52.672 --> 17:54.407
Does it matter?

17:54.441 --> 17:56.443
Chris, come on.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.646
You never talk about it.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.648
You never talk
about Savannah.

18:02.882 --> 18:05.218
Far as I can
tell, you're...

18:05.252 --> 18:07.487
you're not doing anything
to help yourself

18:07.520 --> 18:09.422
deal with her murder.

18:12.459 --> 18:14.694
You loved her.

18:16.663 --> 18:22.202
Same love that lifted you up in
life can drag you down in death.

18:24.471 --> 18:27.807
I said I'm good, okay?

18:27.840 --> 18:30.377
Now can we please go see

18:30.410 --> 18:33.413
what the future of America
knows about Griggs?

18:47.427 --> 18:49.896
Federal agents!

18:49.929 --> 18:52.165
Have some questions.

19:10.483 --> 19:11.751
Hey, NCI...

19:15.555 --> 19:18.157
Oh, I didn't even
get out the "S."

19:23.230 --> 19:26.233
Come on, get in! Get
in! They're coming!

19:26.266 --> 19:28.201
Come on, come on, come on!
Go, go, go, go! Go!

19:28.235 --> 19:29.402
Going somewhere?

19:29.436 --> 19:32.272
Hey, Twiddle Dee, hands up.

19:33.906 --> 19:35.808
Steve?

19:35.842 --> 19:37.810
Yes.
Yes.

19:37.844 --> 19:40.913
Put that down.

19:49.556 --> 19:50.790
How much is obstructing

19:50.823 --> 19:52.792
a federal investigation worth
these days?

19:52.825 --> 19:54.261
Five years.

19:54.294 --> 19:58.398
But added
to the espionage charge,

19:58.431 --> 20:00.700
well, these guys are probably
looking at life in prison.

20:00.733 --> 20:03.470
Espionage? Hey, all we do
is make drones.

20:03.503 --> 20:04.971
Why'd you run, then?

20:05.004 --> 20:06.673
Thought you were with the FAA,

20:06.706 --> 20:08.741
or Homeland Security.

20:08.775 --> 20:09.909
Or the IRS.

20:13.280 --> 20:17.350
You guys, uh,
sell a drone to him?

20:17.384 --> 20:19.886
Yeah, yeah,
Lieutenant Griggs.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.588
Guy knows his stuff.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.856
Very specific, mineral sensor.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.458
Undetectable.

20:25.492 --> 20:26.693
Minerals underground?

20:26.726 --> 20:29.762
Did he mention anyone
he was working with?

20:29.796 --> 20:31.931
No. Man, he just wanted a
birthday present for his son.

20:31.964 --> 20:34.734
State-of-the-art drone
for a birthday present?

20:34.767 --> 20:37.870
Yeah. He got our vote
for dad of the year.

20:37.904 --> 20:39.939
Yeah.

20:47.547 --> 20:49.649
As soon as I told him
you were coming, he took off.

20:51.584 --> 20:52.619
Any idea where he went?

20:52.652 --> 20:54.521
City Park.

20:56.489 --> 20:58.558
Let me talk to him, King.

21:03.730 --> 21:06.366
(ice cream truck
playing jaunty melody)

21:11.838 --> 21:13.005
I want to keep it.

21:13.039 --> 21:15.375
It's the last thing
he gave me.

21:18.545 --> 21:19.779
I see.

21:19.812 --> 21:21.648
But we're trying
to figure out

21:21.681 --> 21:22.982
what happened
to your dad.

21:23.015 --> 21:25.685
How could this help?

21:25.718 --> 21:27.820
We think it's got
pictures on it.

21:33.593 --> 21:35.562
Promise I'll get it
back to you.

21:35.595 --> 21:37.830
You promise?

21:39.832 --> 21:42.735
'Cause...

21:42.769 --> 21:44.571
when my dad was on ships

21:44.604 --> 21:47.907
and I was worried,

21:47.940 --> 21:51.077
my mom would always
say this thing.

21:51.110 --> 21:52.612
"Daddies always come home.

21:52.645 --> 21:55.382
I promise."

22:07.594 --> 22:09.762
We're no closer
to who killed Griggs,

22:09.796 --> 22:12.432
but we do know what
he was taking photos of

22:12.465 --> 22:13.633
the day before he died.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.668
Sebastian downloaded these.

22:15.702 --> 22:17.537
BRODY:
An empty field?

22:17.570 --> 22:19.706
Add these to the photos
from Griggs' storage unit,

22:19.739 --> 22:21.140
place them
in sequential order,

22:21.173 --> 22:25.678
and it seems that the weeks
leading up to his death,

22:25.712 --> 22:27.480
he was mostly focused
on that field,

22:27.514 --> 22:29.148
just outside
of Lakeview.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.618
Well, anything important?
LASALLE:
It's private property.

22:31.651 --> 22:34.721
Cops did say a guy
matching Griggs' description

22:34.754 --> 22:36.589
tried to climb a fence
a couple of days ago

22:36.623 --> 22:37.824
and the owner chased him off.

22:37.857 --> 22:40.660
Griggs looks at bases,

22:40.693 --> 22:42.629
analyzes the fields
that border them,

22:42.662 --> 22:44.864
tries to access this one...
Why?

22:44.897 --> 22:47.500
Call the owner.

22:47.534 --> 22:49.168
Tell him we want
to search the field.

22:49.201 --> 22:52.839
Let's figure out what the hell
Griggs was looking for.

22:52.872 --> 22:55.007
LASALLE:
Mosquito heaven out there.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.444
Yeah. Rock,
paper, scissors?
It's on like Donkey Kong.

22:59.646 --> 23:01.781
Still don't get why I couldn't
rock, paper, scissors.

23:01.814 --> 23:04.851
Sorry, but no roshambo
for the newbie.

23:10.623 --> 23:12.425
It's a canary.

23:12.459 --> 23:13.426
The dress?

23:13.460 --> 23:15.127
It's funny. Come on.

23:15.161 --> 23:17.764
It's not.

23:17.797 --> 23:18.798
Okay.

23:18.831 --> 23:20.967
What am I missing, Percy?

23:21.000 --> 23:22.669
You're treating
this one bad dress

23:22.702 --> 23:23.736
like it's the end of the world.

23:23.770 --> 23:25.505
Or was it just that,
one bad dress?

23:25.538 --> 23:26.739
Anyway...

23:28.508 --> 23:29.776
Were you engaged?

23:29.809 --> 23:31.644
'Cause I got one of those
in my closet.

23:31.678 --> 23:33.513
Old Runaway Bride scenario?

23:33.546 --> 23:34.781
Come on, share.

23:36.783 --> 23:38.217
All right.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.652
There was a guy...

23:39.686 --> 23:40.720
Really?

23:40.753 --> 23:42.922
There was a guy.

23:42.955 --> 23:45.658
You know, I... I thought
we were gonna get married.

23:45.692 --> 23:48.127
He was this...

23:48.160 --> 23:49.896
preppy kid I had a crush on,

23:49.929 --> 23:51.598
and he liked me, too,

23:51.631 --> 23:54.701
but we were from opposite sides
of the tracks.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.235
He bailed

23:56.268 --> 23:58.571
and I ended up
going to senior prom

23:58.605 --> 23:59.972
with my best friend, Duckie.

24:00.006 --> 24:02.909
That's the plot
from Pretty In Pink.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.877
Yes, it is.

24:04.911 --> 24:06.879
I deserved that.
You did.

24:06.913 --> 24:08.748
And what are
we looking for?

24:08.781 --> 24:11.450
What Griggs' couldn't find.

24:12.919 --> 24:14.521
The drone he was using

24:14.554 --> 24:17.089
doesn't see through
walls, does it?

24:38.711 --> 24:40.613
Oh, God,
I hate spiders.

24:41.981 --> 24:44.150
Those aren't spiderwebs.

24:45.818 --> 24:46.986
That's hair.

24:52.959 --> 24:55.762
Guess we found
what Griggs was looking for.

24:57.597 --> 24:59.866
You mean who.

25:10.877 --> 25:12.278
Meet Louisa Banks.

25:12.311 --> 25:14.881
I identified her
from dental records

25:14.914 --> 25:16.549
filed when she went missing
a year ago.

25:16.583 --> 25:17.984
According
to the cops,

25:18.017 --> 25:19.986
her husband said
she went for a run.

25:20.019 --> 25:21.020
Never came home.

25:21.053 --> 25:22.288
Any connects
to Griggs?

25:22.321 --> 25:23.756
None that are obvious.

25:25.224 --> 25:26.893
So we got a wedding,

25:26.926 --> 25:29.662
drone pilot, dead girl,
no leads.

25:29.696 --> 25:31.564
Not none.

25:31.598 --> 25:32.999
Found trace on her clothes.

25:33.032 --> 25:34.867
Sebastian has the sample.

25:34.901 --> 25:36.936
My guess,
it came from the weapon.
Weapon?

25:36.969 --> 25:40.272
Well, something
caused these injuries.

25:40.306 --> 25:42.274
Depressed skull fracture

25:42.308 --> 25:44.276
on her parietal bone,

25:44.310 --> 25:46.245
dislocated shoulder,

25:46.278 --> 25:49.949
and five vertebrae broken
in her neck.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.217
King,

25:51.250 --> 25:52.351
Griggs surveilled
those bases,

25:52.384 --> 25:55.021
narrowed it to that field...

25:55.054 --> 25:56.656
He knew Louisa was there.

25:56.689 --> 25:58.625
So this wasn't espionage.

25:58.658 --> 26:01.227
Griggs was looking
for a murder victim.

26:02.629 --> 26:04.196
MAN:
This Griggs person...

26:04.230 --> 26:06.733
I've never seen him before.

26:06.766 --> 26:08.067
You think he had

26:08.100 --> 26:09.836
something to do
with my wife's disappearance?

26:09.869 --> 26:10.903
That's what we're trying

26:10.937 --> 26:11.938
to find out, Mr. Banks.

26:13.072 --> 26:16.042
Police report said jogging.

26:16.075 --> 26:18.244
Round the far side
of the levee,

26:18.277 --> 26:21.614
down the road to Carrollton.

26:21.648 --> 26:23.115
When she didn't come home...

26:24.316 --> 26:26.986
Mr. Banks, we'll figure out

26:27.019 --> 26:29.789
who did this to Louisa.
All right?

26:29.822 --> 26:31.090
Whether this Mr. Griggs guy

26:31.123 --> 26:32.759
had something to do with it
or someone else.

26:32.792 --> 26:33.993
We'll get 'em.

26:34.026 --> 26:38.097
Then what?

26:38.130 --> 26:40.700
It's not like
that's gonna bring her back.

26:40.733 --> 26:41.968
Right?

26:50.977 --> 26:53.045
I'll be out here.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.650
Photos from the wedding,
finally back.

27:00.086 --> 27:03.255
You know, it must be hard
for you, looking at all this.

27:03.289 --> 27:07.059
Because of whatever it is
you're not going to tell me.

27:07.093 --> 27:10.897
Yo, B, let it go.

27:10.930 --> 27:13.199
I won't.

27:13.232 --> 27:14.433
I can't.

27:14.466 --> 27:17.103
Too compelling.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.106
Ty Tarpley.

27:21.173 --> 27:22.208
Weddings, dresses...

27:22.241 --> 27:23.209
I hate it all because...

27:23.242 --> 27:24.443
Ty Tarpley?

27:24.476 --> 27:25.444
Yeah.

27:25.477 --> 27:27.079
This is a true story?

27:27.113 --> 27:28.380
Really?

27:28.414 --> 27:30.416
You think I'd make up a name
like Ty Tarpley?

27:34.420 --> 27:36.956
Ty and I worked
at a club together

27:36.989 --> 27:38.190
when we were in college.

27:38.224 --> 27:41.460
And we really
liked each other.

27:41.493 --> 27:43.696
Only problem...
he was engaged.

27:43.730 --> 27:45.732
But he said
they were breaking up,

27:45.765 --> 27:47.399
so no harm, no foul, right?

27:48.367 --> 27:51.003
Well, I fall hard.

27:51.037 --> 27:53.372
Months go by...

27:53.405 --> 27:55.207
we're in love.

27:55.241 --> 27:58.177
Till one day, I see pictures
of him on Facebook.

27:58.210 --> 28:00.012
Him and the old fiancée.

28:00.046 --> 28:01.848
Went to the courthouse,
got married.

28:01.881 --> 28:03.149
No...
Oh, yeah.

28:03.182 --> 28:05.184
And it gets better.
We got into it.

28:05.217 --> 28:06.185
You and Ty?

28:06.218 --> 28:07.286
Oh, no, no, no. Me and the wife.

28:07.319 --> 28:09.388
Cat fight.

28:09.421 --> 28:11.758
So I end up in the alley
with some female patrol

28:11.791 --> 28:14.727
telling me whole thing's
my fault.

28:14.761 --> 28:16.062
She wasn't wrong.

28:16.095 --> 28:18.064
So what'd you do?

28:18.097 --> 28:21.333
Well, I dropped
out of school,

28:21.367 --> 28:23.202
wore black for,
like, two years,

28:23.235 --> 28:24.403
became a vegan.

28:24.436 --> 28:25.872
You gave up meat and cheese

28:25.905 --> 28:27.073
for a guy named Ty Tarpley?

28:27.106 --> 28:29.776
Yeah, I know. It's crazy, right?

28:31.210 --> 28:33.112
How hard was that?

28:33.145 --> 28:34.513
Sharing a little?

28:34.546 --> 28:36.215
Oh, I don't know, B.

28:36.248 --> 28:38.250
Maybe I'll ask my shrink
next time I see her.

28:38.284 --> 28:39.786
You have a shrink?

28:39.819 --> 28:42.421
Ooh, and the plot thickens...

28:42.454 --> 28:44.123
It does.

28:44.156 --> 28:46.959
Mr. Banks said Louisa
ran on the levee

28:46.993 --> 28:48.795
down to Carrollton.

28:48.828 --> 28:51.497
Let's take a walk.

28:54.500 --> 28:57.036
PRIDE:
I see what's going on here,
Chris.

28:57.069 --> 29:00.873
Partying, women, not sleeping...

29:00.907 --> 29:02.441
It hasn't interfered
with my job, King.

29:02.474 --> 29:03.876
There's no reason for this.

29:03.910 --> 29:06.813
It's all just a temporary fix.

29:06.846 --> 29:10.249
Okay? Just so you don't have
to deal with Savannah's death.

29:11.918 --> 29:14.020
It's the noises
outside my window.

29:16.155 --> 29:19.025
All right?
That's why I can't...

29:19.058 --> 29:20.459
sleep at home.

29:22.061 --> 29:23.896
People yelling,

29:23.930 --> 29:26.032
street musicians.

29:26.065 --> 29:28.901
Savannah and I, we used to...

29:28.935 --> 29:31.170
we used to just lay there...

29:31.203 --> 29:33.139
listening and laughing.

29:35.474 --> 29:38.044
And now, when I slow down,

29:38.077 --> 29:40.212
I hear those noises.

29:41.580 --> 29:44.016
There's no way around pain.

29:47.386 --> 29:51.290
All you can do is...

29:51.323 --> 29:54.093
make friends with the devil.

29:56.195 --> 29:59.265
Feel it... move through it.

30:02.201 --> 30:05.037
For me, I got my music.

30:05.071 --> 30:07.206
Piano.

30:07.239 --> 30:09.876
That's how I lean in...

30:09.909 --> 30:11.310
find peace.

30:14.180 --> 30:16.582
Just need to figure out
what that is for you.

30:16.615 --> 30:19.886
And then what?

30:19.919 --> 30:21.287
I'm all better?

30:21.320 --> 30:24.123
Then you're on
the road to better.

30:26.292 --> 30:27.593
Huh?

30:27.626 --> 30:30.196
You hear me?

30:30.229 --> 30:31.597
Husband said
the turn around

30:31.630 --> 30:34.033
on Louisa's jogging
route was this bar.

30:34.066 --> 30:35.234
Might as well
ask around.

30:35.267 --> 30:37.403
* Get out of the way

30:37.436 --> 30:41.173
* Up off the tracks...

30:41.207 --> 30:43.042
PRIDE:
Listen, um...

30:43.075 --> 30:45.211
Hey, King.

30:45.244 --> 30:46.478
Excuse me.

30:46.512 --> 30:49.481
*

30:51.283 --> 30:53.352
Navy hangout,
Seabee battalions.

30:53.385 --> 30:55.621
There was a Seabee battalion
at the wedding.

30:55.654 --> 30:57.223
And Louisa's body was hidden

30:57.256 --> 30:58.958
a mile away from here.

30:58.991 --> 31:00.426
Griggs surveils bases

31:00.459 --> 31:03.162
and the surrounding fields
looking for Louisa.

31:03.195 --> 31:07.099
Focuses on the one field
next to a Seabee training camp.

31:08.634 --> 31:10.336
What do you want to bet

31:10.369 --> 31:12.604
that Griggs was at that wedding
trying to solve her murder?

31:12.638 --> 31:14.173
SEBASTIAN:
Flakes we found on Louisa's

31:14.206 --> 31:15.374
body came back

31:15.407 --> 31:16.976
as vintage lightbulb glass.

31:17.009 --> 31:18.310
So, someone beats Louisa
to death

31:18.344 --> 31:21.347
with an antique... lamp

31:21.380 --> 31:23.249
No, uh, an old car.

31:23.282 --> 31:24.917
The glass is from headlights.

31:24.951 --> 31:26.652
Yeah, it did help us
to look at Louisa's injury

31:26.685 --> 31:28.187
in a whole new light.

31:28.220 --> 31:29.388
Initially, we thought

31:29.421 --> 31:31.023
she'd been beaten to death,

31:31.057 --> 31:32.358
because all her injuries were
to the upper body.

31:32.391 --> 31:34.260
Right, but if she was hit
by a car...

31:34.293 --> 31:36.395
Maybe she's out running,

31:36.428 --> 31:39.398
uh, bent over to tie her shoes,
catch her breath, stretch.

31:39.431 --> 31:41.333
Then... bam.

31:41.367 --> 31:44.236
Suspect's driving,
hits Louisa, kills her,

31:44.270 --> 31:46.138
hides her body.

31:47.439 --> 31:48.474
Make and model of the car?

31:48.507 --> 31:52.011
Oh, uh, 1968...

31:52.044 --> 31:53.245
Buick Skylark.

31:53.279 --> 31:55.414
Honeymoon car from the wedding.

32:00.186 --> 32:02.088
This is the last
one, I swear.

32:12.664 --> 32:15.201
BRODY:
Petty Officer Hewitt,

32:15.234 --> 32:16.635
we need to ask you
a few questions.

32:16.668 --> 32:18.270
What
Oh, come on.

32:18.304 --> 32:19.671
They have been stuck here
for this investigation.

32:19.705 --> 32:21.307
Let them go on their honeymoon,
already.

32:21.340 --> 32:22.441
Honeymoon's over.

32:22.474 --> 32:23.342
Petty Officer Hewitt,

32:23.375 --> 32:25.144
you're under arrest

32:25.177 --> 32:26.278
for the murder of Louisa Banks.

32:26.312 --> 32:28.147
What?

32:39.025 --> 32:40.626
BRODY:
Louisa Banks?

32:40.659 --> 32:41.727
I...

32:41.760 --> 32:45.531
Look, I don't even know anyone
named Louisa, okay?

32:45.564 --> 32:47.533
And-And the only time
I ever saw that...

32:47.566 --> 32:49.435
Lieutenant Griggs
was when he was...

32:49.468 --> 32:52.138
Laying there stabbed to death
at your wedding?

32:52.171 --> 32:54.473
He gave you a chance to come
clean about Louisa's murder,

32:54.506 --> 32:57.509
didn't he? But instead, you
killed him to keep him quiet.
Look...

32:57.543 --> 32:59.345
I'm telling the truth.

32:59.378 --> 33:00.779
Well, the evidence doesn't lie.

33:00.812 --> 33:03.149
The lab peaked at your car.

33:03.182 --> 33:05.517
Found traces of Louisa's blood
under your bumper.

33:05.551 --> 33:07.286
I used to park my car on base,

33:07.319 --> 33:08.754
and all the guys
in my unit would use it.

33:08.787 --> 33:10.189
Yeah

33:10.222 --> 33:13.459
All the guys.
Look, I...

33:13.492 --> 33:15.461
I've been through hell with
them, okay? They're my blood.

33:15.494 --> 33:17.396
None of them would have done
anything like this.

33:17.429 --> 33:20.466
Look, I wasn't even around
whenever this girl died.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.568
Okay, I was... I was
at Alison's mother's.

33:22.601 --> 33:24.570
Your mother-in-law
is your alibi?

33:24.603 --> 33:28.440
She hates me, so, if I wasn't
there, she'll tell you.

33:30.476 --> 33:32.211
LASALLE:
He's telling the truth.

33:32.244 --> 33:34.280
Mother-in-law says he
was with the family.

33:34.313 --> 33:36.615
Not our killer.
Who is?

33:36.648 --> 33:38.784
Got to be someone who knew

33:38.817 --> 33:40.486
car was at the base.

33:40.519 --> 33:43.555
Said people borrowed it
all the time.

33:43.589 --> 33:44.556
Think he knows?

33:44.590 --> 33:45.757
I get the sense, no.

33:45.791 --> 33:47.559
Then we talk to the Seabees.

33:47.593 --> 33:49.295
It's a tight-knit group.

33:49.328 --> 33:51.263
None's came forward yet,
doubt any will now.

33:51.297 --> 33:52.631
BRODY:
I might know a way

33:52.664 --> 33:54.266
around this.

33:54.300 --> 33:55.467
Keep him in there
another 15 minutes?

33:55.501 --> 33:59.105
I was wondering if I could

33:59.138 --> 34:01.173
have your help
with something.

34:01.207 --> 34:02.741
Louisa Banks.

34:02.774 --> 34:06.445
We believe that
one of the Seabees

34:06.478 --> 34:08.747
on your husband's unit
may have killed her.

34:08.780 --> 34:13.185
And, you know, you did such
great research on your guests--

34:13.219 --> 34:15.487
the whole Google search
and personal touch...

34:15.521 --> 34:17.589
Mm. Well, I assure you,
no one told me

34:17.623 --> 34:19.458
that they murdered anyone.

34:19.491 --> 34:22.761
Did any of your husband's
friends ever mention her?

34:22.794 --> 34:25.097
No.

34:25.131 --> 34:27.466
Any of them have problems
with women, bad breakups?

34:27.499 --> 34:29.368
No.

34:29.401 --> 34:32.204
Domestic abuse?
You know what?
Um, I think we're done here,

34:32.238 --> 34:34.606
and I think it's time
for Hewitt and I

34:34.640 --> 34:35.874
to go on our honeymoon, so...

34:35.907 --> 34:37.543
Alison,

34:37.576 --> 34:41.079
Louisa was starting
a life, just like you.

34:42.614 --> 34:47.686
Well, and I am sorry
for this woman, and I feel

34:47.719 --> 34:49.588
for her family, I do,

34:49.621 --> 34:51.523
but there is something
you need to understand.

34:51.557 --> 34:56.262
My husband, Hewitt,
and his entire unit--

34:56.295 --> 34:58.597
they almost died
on their last tour.

34:58.630 --> 35:01.367
They were under attack
for almost five hours straight.

35:01.400 --> 35:04.303
It's a miracle that they made it
back from Afghanistan at all.

35:06.772 --> 35:09.441
Alison, did your husband
ever mention

35:09.475 --> 35:12.278
if there was drone support
when they were attacked?

35:12.311 --> 35:13.779
MAN:
About two months ago,

35:13.812 --> 35:15.647
that Seabee unit was
pinned down by combatants

35:15.681 --> 35:16.882
in the Korengal Valley.

35:16.915 --> 35:18.550
Drone support
was requested.

35:18.584 --> 35:20.319
Griggs?

35:20.352 --> 35:22.588
He stayed with that
unit for 12 hours.

35:22.621 --> 35:24.390
Spoke to those sailors.

35:24.423 --> 35:26.425
Told them where
the enemy was,

35:26.458 --> 35:27.926
helped reinforcements
find them.

35:27.959 --> 35:31.397
He was able to talk to troops
in Afghanistan from here?

35:31.430 --> 35:34.633
Com system is integrated with
JTACS on the ground there.

35:34.666 --> 35:36.868
Team leader is dialed
in with the pilot.

35:36.902 --> 35:39.338
I need access to the recordings
of that night.

35:39.371 --> 35:41.707
They're compartmented,
Agent Pride.

35:41.740 --> 35:43.842
LASALLE:
There's a kid that went

35:43.875 --> 35:47.613
to bed last night knowing
that his dad's not coming home.

35:47.646 --> 35:49.748
Think he deserves to know why?

35:52.684 --> 35:54.620
DISPATCHER:
Night Owl 5, we've got a unit
of Seabees

35:54.653 --> 35:56.688
building an airstrip.

35:56.722 --> 35:58.657
They're taking fire.
Requesting UAV Support.
MAN: Copy that...

35:58.690 --> 36:00.359
MAN: This has all
been archived.

36:00.392 --> 36:02.228
No one has listened to
it since it happened.

36:02.261 --> 36:05.331
DISPATCHER: Roger. Stand by.
Patching you in. Team Leader,

36:05.364 --> 36:07.399
on with Night Owl 5...
Night Owl 5.

36:07.433 --> 36:08.867
Griggs' call sign.

36:08.900 --> 36:11.503
His drone was over
the Seabee Unit's position.

36:11.537 --> 36:12.704
GRIGGS:
Copy. This is Night Owl.

36:12.738 --> 36:14.373
We have eyes on you. Go.

36:14.406 --> 36:16.208
TEAM LEADER:
We're pinned down!

36:16.242 --> 36:18.210
GRIGGS:
Enemy combatants advancing
at your ten.

36:18.244 --> 36:19.578
TEAM LEADER:
Watch your ten, guys!

36:19.611 --> 36:21.413
BOONE :
This is it, Kirby.

36:21.447 --> 36:22.881
KIRBY:
Shut up, Boone!

36:22.914 --> 36:24.583
BOONE:
I'm gonna die.

36:24.616 --> 36:26.218
I'm gonna go to hell.

36:26.252 --> 36:27.986
KIRBY:
What are you talking about?

36:28.019 --> 36:30.689
BOONE:
Kirby, I ran over a girl.

36:30.722 --> 36:32.958
I borrowed Hewitt's car.

36:32.991 --> 36:34.660
This jogger.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.728
I didn't see her.

36:36.762 --> 36:40.432
She was dead,
so I buried her in a field.

36:40.466 --> 36:42.701
God forgive me.

36:42.734 --> 36:46.605
Oh, God forgive me.

36:48.307 --> 36:51.377
All but one person
survived that night.

36:51.410 --> 36:52.644
Petty Officer Kirby.

36:52.678 --> 36:54.746
PRIDE:
My guess...

36:54.780 --> 36:56.782
no coincidence.

36:56.815 --> 36:59.651
You managed
to kill the only person

36:59.685 --> 37:01.620
who knew about your crime.

37:01.653 --> 37:03.822
There's no proof of that.

37:03.855 --> 37:06.692
People say things
when they're scared.

37:06.725 --> 37:09.595
People say things
when they're guilty.

37:10.996 --> 37:14.466
Lieutenant Griggs heard
your confession, your name.

37:14.500 --> 37:17.369
He wanted proof
before he went to anyone.

37:17.403 --> 37:20.372
He found out
what bases you trained at.

37:20.406 --> 37:22.741
Searched them

37:22.774 --> 37:25.977
for the car,
the fields around them.

37:26.011 --> 37:28.814
Figured out
where Louisa's body might be.

37:31.683 --> 37:33.885
He showed up
just before the wedding

37:33.919 --> 37:36.755
when I was
decorating the car.

37:36.788 --> 37:39.658
He said he might know
where Louisa's body was.

37:39.691 --> 37:41.927
He wanted you
to do the right thing.

37:46.598 --> 37:48.800
Who the hell
do you think you are?

37:51.337 --> 37:53.772
Honor.

37:54.906 --> 37:57.476
Courage.

37:57.509 --> 37:59.511
Commitment.

37:59.545 --> 38:02.748
You killed a father, a hero.

38:02.781 --> 38:05.451
The man who saved your life.

38:05.484 --> 38:06.852
:
Yeah.

38:08.787 --> 38:10.789
God help me.

38:13.792 --> 38:15.661
Help me for what I did.

38:15.694 --> 38:17.829
Yeah, don't hold your breath.

38:24.102 --> 38:28.707
LASALLE:
Boone escapes death
by the skin of his teeth.

38:28.740 --> 38:31.377
Killed Griggs, the
man who saved him.

38:31.410 --> 38:33.912
There are some bad decisions
you cannot undo.

38:33.945 --> 38:36.882
I guess so.

38:40.586 --> 38:42.521
What's up?

38:42.554 --> 38:43.855
Got a hot date.

38:43.889 --> 38:44.756
* Let 'em down...

38:46.792 --> 38:49.395
* Hold on...

38:49.428 --> 38:52.431
Hope that's not
tomorrow's regret.
Don't worry.

38:52.464 --> 38:54.566
* So hold on...

38:54.600 --> 38:56.034
I heard you, King.

38:56.067 --> 38:59.938
* On to me.

38:59.971 --> 39:03.642
RYAN:
You kept your promise.

39:03.675 --> 39:06.912
Yup. Even got a friend of
mine to give it a tune-up.

39:06.945 --> 39:09.481
Okay, so...

39:09.515 --> 39:14.953
this moves it and down.

39:14.986 --> 39:17.122
And this turns the camera.
Got it?

39:17.155 --> 39:18.924
Okay, but you're
gonna have to help me.

39:18.957 --> 39:21.560
It's easy. Here.

39:21.593 --> 39:23.595
Watch.

39:23.629 --> 39:26.498
* And all this time

39:26.532 --> 39:28.099
* You spend looking up...

39:35.140 --> 39:37.142
* Hold on...

39:37.175 --> 39:40.412
Night Owl 5, Night Owl 5,
this is Eagle 12.

39:40.446 --> 39:43.749
Eagle 12, I got a copy.

39:43.782 --> 39:45.951
See?

39:45.984 --> 39:48.554
There it goes.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.468
You okay, bud?

40:02.501 --> 40:05.704
I really miss my dad.

40:05.737 --> 40:08.674
I don't think
anyone gets how much.

40:09.675 --> 40:11.977
I do, kid.

40:14.045 --> 40:15.847
I do.
