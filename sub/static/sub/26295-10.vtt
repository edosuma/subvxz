WEBVTT

00:05.135 --> 00:05.353
.

00:05.396 --> 00:07.137
- I thought you'd never get up.

00:07.181 --> 00:08.399
- Mmm, it's your fault.

00:08.443 --> 00:09.705
You kept me up too late.

00:11.402 --> 00:13.752
- Mm-hmm.

00:13.796 --> 00:15.493
- You didn't tell me
this thing tonight

00:15.537 --> 00:16.755
was such a big deal.

00:18.496 --> 00:21.325
- "City Honors Gaffney Chicago
Medical Center Tonight."

00:21.369 --> 00:23.414
It's all about your hybrid OR.

00:23.458 --> 00:27.114
- Mm, they must be
desperate for news.

00:27.157 --> 00:30.204
Mmm.

00:34.121 --> 00:36.210
- The city officials
are gonna be there.

00:36.253 --> 00:38.821
And the board.

00:40.431 --> 00:41.737
Let's not go.

00:41.780 --> 00:43.521
Let's...

00:43.565 --> 00:45.219
stay home,

00:45.262 --> 00:48.700
and...
- No.

00:48.744 --> 00:51.225
I am so with you there,
but we have to go.

00:51.268 --> 00:53.314
At least make an appearance.

00:54.750 --> 00:57.448
- Uh, no, absolutely not.

00:57.492 --> 00:59.755
There wouldn't be hybrid OR
if it wasn't for you.

00:59.798 --> 01:04.412
- I just don't feel like it.

01:04.455 --> 01:06.370
- I want you there.

01:06.414 --> 01:09.069
You're my girl.

01:14.291 --> 01:16.424
- Then honor my wishes.

01:16.467 --> 01:18.687
I'm not going.

01:23.474 --> 01:25.346
- I saw Ethan and Vicki
at Gibson's.

01:25.389 --> 01:27.217
- Ethan's old girlfriend.

01:27.261 --> 01:28.610
- Or maybe new girlfriend.

01:28.653 --> 01:30.394
I mean, she's beautiful.

01:30.438 --> 01:33.354
A doctor and a naval officer.

01:33.397 --> 01:34.703
How do you compete with that?

01:34.746 --> 01:36.400
- I'm not competing with that.

01:36.444 --> 01:37.575
Ethan can see whoever he wants.

01:37.619 --> 01:39.490
- Okay.
So you're dating?

01:39.534 --> 01:40.752
- That's beside the point.

01:40.796 --> 01:41.840
- So you're not.

01:41.884 --> 01:43.233
- It's so hard to meet people.

01:44.713 --> 01:47.455
- Get down!

01:59.641 --> 02:01.556
- Agh! My gun!

02:04.385 --> 02:06.430
â™ª

02:06.474 --> 02:09.346
- There's been a shooting.

02:20.140 --> 02:20.488
.

02:20.531 --> 02:22.229
- Oh, my God!
April

02:22.272 --> 02:23.578
- Dennis Mitchell, 28,

02:23.621 --> 02:24.927
unrestrained motor vehicle
collision.

02:24.970 --> 02:26.363
- You're going to Baghdad.

02:26.407 --> 02:28.626
April?

02:28.670 --> 02:31.455
- It's justice!
- I'm fine.

02:31.499 --> 02:32.891
- Bitches like you
just want me to suffer.

02:32.935 --> 02:34.589
You're the enemy!

02:34.632 --> 02:35.764
It's justice!

02:35.807 --> 02:37.461
- Patient is violent

02:37.505 --> 02:38.897
and delusional.
GCS 15.

02:38.941 --> 02:41.378
BP is normal.
- I'm gonna kill them all!

02:41.422 --> 02:42.901
- Dr. Choi, I need you
in Baghdad now.

02:43.946 --> 02:45.861
- I'll take care of her.

02:45.904 --> 02:47.297
- Dr. Charles.

02:47.341 --> 02:49.386
Now!

02:49.430 --> 02:50.431
- Yeah.
- Well, you've been through

02:50.474 --> 02:52.389
enough this morning.
Go home.

02:53.695 --> 02:55.610
- Thank you.

02:55.653 --> 02:56.785
- Well, the ED's short now.

02:56.828 --> 02:58.395
- We'll manage.

02:58.439 --> 02:59.788
- I didn't get a scratch
thanks to April.

02:59.831 --> 03:01.050
I don't feel right leaving.

03:01.093 --> 03:02.965
- Okay, it's up to you.

03:03.008 --> 03:04.793
- I'll take care of her.
- Okay.

03:06.621 --> 03:09.928
- Left arm's deformed,
probably a humerus fracture.

03:14.672 --> 03:15.978
- Dr. Choi.

03:16.021 --> 03:17.980
- 50 of fentanyl for the pain.

03:25.335 --> 03:26.771
They had it coming.

03:26.815 --> 03:28.469
It's justice!

03:28.512 --> 03:29.644
- Dr. Charles, help me out.

03:29.687 --> 03:31.385
- 5 of haloperidol.

03:31.428 --> 03:33.474
- They'll...they'll learn.

03:33.517 --> 03:35.345
They'll all learn!

03:35.389 --> 03:36.825
- Breath sounds
present bilaterally,

03:36.868 --> 03:38.566
multiple lacerations.

03:38.609 --> 03:39.741
Looks like a displaced
chin implant.

03:39.784 --> 03:41.046
Let's get his clothes off.

03:41.090 --> 03:43.397
Gonna need X-rays.

03:46.182 --> 03:47.531
- Displaced pectoral implant.

03:47.575 --> 03:49.141
Clear.

03:52.449 --> 03:53.929
He's had a lot
of plastic surgery.

03:53.972 --> 03:55.670
Chest is clear,
humerus fractures,

03:55.713 --> 03:58.499
get a CVC, BMP, UA tox,
and order a CT head.

03:58.542 --> 04:00.022
- Got it.

04:03.155 --> 04:05.419
- Also a liver panel,
cardiac enzymes, and EKG.

04:06.942 --> 04:07.899
- Gotta cover all of our bases.

04:07.943 --> 04:09.118
- Dr. Choi.

04:09.161 --> 04:10.728
- Get that feminoid
out of here.

04:10.772 --> 04:12.556
You're the enemy!

04:12.600 --> 04:14.558
- Okay. I was gonna
take him to lock-up.

04:14.602 --> 04:15.820
- Sorry, Kim.
He's not ready yet.

04:15.864 --> 04:18.562
- Bitch!

04:18.606 --> 04:19.911
- While he's still here,

04:19.955 --> 04:21.826
can we grab a psych eval?

04:21.870 --> 04:23.524
- Yeah, knock yourself out.

04:23.567 --> 04:26.178
But I'm keeping a police detail
on this guy.

04:27.832 --> 04:31.401
- Let me know
when I can talk to him.

04:35.927 --> 04:38.452
- I'm so sorry, April.

04:38.495 --> 04:39.975
It's terrifying to be shot at.

04:40.018 --> 04:41.455
I can't believe you were hit.

04:41.498 --> 04:42.717
- I'm fine.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.545
Will you sign me off
to go back to work?

04:45.763 --> 04:47.417
- I don't even need stiches.
I...

04:47.461 --> 04:49.419
I'd feel better.

04:49.463 --> 04:50.638
- Okay.

04:50.681 --> 04:52.553
Just take it easy.

04:52.596 --> 04:55.120
All right?
- Thanks.

04:55.164 --> 04:56.121
- When are we
gonna do something

04:56.165 --> 04:58.428
about all these guns?

05:05.609 --> 05:06.784
Everything okay?

05:06.828 --> 05:08.569
- My PhD project.

05:08.612 --> 05:10.658
Reprogramming human
pluripotent cells

05:10.701 --> 05:12.573
into hematopoietic stem cells.

05:12.616 --> 05:14.009
Previous data had showed
successful induction of cells

05:14.052 --> 05:15.576
into monocytes, but...

05:15.619 --> 05:17.752
I re-ran
the single-cell cytometry

05:17.795 --> 05:20.929
and didn't detect any
CD34-positive cells, so.

05:20.972 --> 05:22.234
I did something wrong,
I don't know.

05:22.278 --> 05:23.932
It doesn't corroborate.
I--I...

05:23.975 --> 05:26.543
I didn't sleep at all
last night.

05:26.587 --> 05:27.936
- Hmm.

05:27.979 --> 05:29.938
Didn't or couldn't?

05:29.981 --> 05:31.243
- What difference
does that make?

05:31.287 --> 05:32.984
- Dr. Charles,
while we're waiting

05:33.028 --> 05:36.771
to get Dennis Mitchell to CT,
you can talk to him.

05:36.814 --> 05:38.033
- Why don't you
take a break from that

05:38.076 --> 05:41.776
and come help me evaluate
this patient?

05:41.819 --> 05:43.647
What do you
need to evaluate?

05:43.691 --> 05:45.040
He's crazy.

05:45.083 --> 05:46.955
- Maybe, but, um...

05:46.998 --> 05:48.739
well, there are different
kinds of crazy.

05:48.783 --> 05:51.742
With very different
legal implications.

05:51.786 --> 05:54.179
Mr. Mitchell.
I'm Dr. Charles.

05:54.223 --> 05:56.051
This is Student Doctor Curry.

05:56.094 --> 05:57.052
You've had quite a day.

05:57.095 --> 05:58.445
Haven't you?

05:58.488 --> 05:59.794
I bet you when you woke up
this morning

05:59.837 --> 06:01.926
you didn't think
you were gonna end up here.

06:01.970 --> 06:04.015
- Does that feminoid
have to be here?

06:05.321 --> 06:07.802
- Feminoid. Foid.

06:07.845 --> 06:09.238
Tell her to get out.

06:12.720 --> 06:15.113
- Okay, you're gonna treat
Miss Curry with respect.

06:15.157 --> 06:16.463
And you don't get to decide

06:16.506 --> 06:17.942
who's in this room
or who isn't.

06:17.986 --> 06:20.858
Do you understand me?

06:22.207 --> 06:24.514
Okay, I'm gonna ask you

06:24.558 --> 06:26.951
a couple of questions because--
well, 'cause I have to.

06:26.995 --> 06:28.692
Um, just to check the boxes.

06:28.736 --> 06:30.781
Have you ever been medicated
for your thinking?

06:30.825 --> 06:31.826
- No.

06:31.869 --> 06:33.305
- Have you ever heard voices

06:33.349 --> 06:34.306
that other people don't?

06:34.350 --> 06:35.699
- No.

06:35.743 --> 06:37.701
I do not hear voices.
- Okay.

06:37.745 --> 06:39.181
So, um...

06:39.224 --> 06:42.227
why don't you tell me
what happened this morning?

06:42.271 --> 06:44.273
- That Stacy got
what she deserved.

06:44.316 --> 06:46.841
Bitch wouldn't even
have a cup of coffee with me.

06:46.884 --> 06:49.670
- They are in control.

06:49.713 --> 06:51.933
They have sex
whenever they want it.

06:51.976 --> 06:54.283
But no matter what I do,

06:54.326 --> 06:56.546
they deny me.

06:56.590 --> 06:57.547
- Okay.

06:57.591 --> 07:00.158
- I deserve love.

07:00.202 --> 07:01.899
But they won't give it to me.

07:01.943 --> 07:03.510
They only give it

07:03.553 --> 07:06.556
to those shallow,
stupid alphas.

07:10.908 --> 07:13.302
- So besides being
a rabid misogynist,

07:13.345 --> 07:14.782
what kind of crazy is he?

07:14.825 --> 07:16.740
- Well, he was using
certain buzzwords

07:16.784 --> 07:17.828
that could be telling.

07:17.872 --> 07:19.047
You know, Stacy,

07:19.090 --> 07:20.701
feminoid.

07:20.744 --> 07:22.572
Makes me wonder if he has
an online presence.

07:22.616 --> 07:24.052
Could you check that out
for me?

07:24.095 --> 07:25.880
- Dr. Charles,
I am extremely busy.

07:25.923 --> 07:27.055
- Oh, okay.

07:27.098 --> 07:28.578
Well, in that case, um,

07:28.622 --> 07:30.275
I guess now you're even busier.

07:36.586 --> 07:38.066
Maggie.
- Yeah.

07:38.109 --> 07:39.197
- I'm starting to think
that maybe

07:39.241 --> 07:40.721
this wasn't a random shooting.

07:40.764 --> 07:42.244
Could you look and see
if Mr. Mitchell

07:42.287 --> 07:44.855
has ever been a patient
in this hospital before?

07:44.899 --> 07:46.117
- Sure thing.

07:46.161 --> 07:47.815
- Thank you.

07:47.858 --> 07:50.557
- Come in.

07:50.600 --> 07:53.821
Dr. Manning,
this is Agent Lee.

07:53.864 --> 07:56.214
- I've been overseeing
Dr. Halstead's relocation

07:56.258 --> 07:57.912
in Witness Protection.

07:57.955 --> 07:59.130
- I know who you are.

07:59.174 --> 08:02.133
- Well, I'll leave
you two to talk.

08:03.831 --> 08:05.920
- I know things have
been difficult for you.

08:05.963 --> 08:08.139
- You guys wouldn't tell me
where he was.

08:08.183 --> 08:10.098
You wouldn't even let me
speak to him.

08:10.141 --> 08:12.187
- I'm sorry.
That's standard procedure.

08:12.230 --> 08:13.841
- Was it standard procedure
to take him away

08:13.884 --> 08:14.842
on our wedding day?

08:14.885 --> 08:16.365
- It was for his own safety.

08:16.408 --> 08:17.975
If it's any consolation,

08:18.019 --> 08:20.282
Dr. Halstead did the FBI
a great service.

08:20.325 --> 08:22.023
Because of him we were able

08:22.066 --> 08:24.155
to bring some very bad people
to justice.

08:25.330 --> 08:26.854
- The Burkes are incarcerated.

08:26.897 --> 08:28.812
We've determined it's safe
for Dr. Halstead

08:28.856 --> 08:32.294
to return to Chicago.

08:34.165 --> 08:35.819
- Yes.

08:35.863 --> 08:37.865
You should know there may be

08:37.908 --> 08:39.127
a period of adjustment.

08:40.476 --> 08:42.130
- He's had
a traumatic experience

08:42.173 --> 08:44.872
and he's been cut off
from his friends and family.

08:44.915 --> 08:47.048
Some people
re-integrate easily.

08:47.091 --> 08:50.442
Some don't.

08:50.486 --> 08:53.010
Call me if you have
any questions.

09:01.279 --> 09:02.803
- Yes, Natalie cleared me.

09:02.846 --> 09:05.457
- You should go home.
- Ethan, I'm fine.

09:05.501 --> 09:08.156
Talk to me,
what do we got?

09:08.199 --> 09:10.158
- Ivy Davis. 30 weeks pregnant,
pre-term labor.

09:10.201 --> 09:11.725
- All right.

09:11.768 --> 09:13.074
- We're gonna get you
a doctor, okay?

09:13.117 --> 09:14.466
Dr. Manning,
you're going to Six.

09:14.510 --> 09:15.816
- Page OB.
- On it.

09:15.859 --> 09:16.947
- She can't have
this baby right now.

09:16.991 --> 09:18.209
You have to stop it.

09:18.253 --> 09:19.994
- She has a pre-existing
aneurysm.

09:20.037 --> 09:21.952
- If she pushes,
it could kill her.

09:21.996 --> 09:23.693
- All right,
help me get her into the bed.

09:23.737 --> 09:25.216
Why wasn't the aneurysm
treated earlier?

09:25.260 --> 09:27.175
- It's small.

09:27.218 --> 09:28.829
- She's not supposed to be
in labor right now.

09:28.872 --> 09:30.047
We have a C-section scheduled.

09:30.091 --> 09:31.266
- But not for two more months.

09:31.309 --> 09:32.397
- Heart rate 97.

09:32.441 --> 09:34.138
BP 128/73.
- Shh.

09:34.182 --> 09:35.792
It's okay. Breathe.

09:35.836 --> 09:37.185
- Let's start a magnesium drip,
embolus 4 grams.

09:37.228 --> 09:38.752
- Got it.
- And 12.5 milligrams

09:38.795 --> 09:40.144
of betamethasone IM,

09:40.188 --> 09:43.017
and 100 milligrams
of indomethacin PO.

09:43.060 --> 09:45.106
Ivy, we need to give you
this pill, okay?

09:45.149 --> 09:46.847
It's gonna help stop
your contractions.

09:46.890 --> 09:48.457
- OB said that they'll be down
as soon as they can.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.372
- Okay.

09:50.415 --> 09:51.939
- Okay, hold on.
You're okay.

09:51.982 --> 09:54.898
You're doing great.
Just breathe.

10:02.253 --> 10:03.428
- Don't push, don't push!

10:03.472 --> 10:05.735
No, no, no, no!

10:08.433 --> 10:10.392
- Dr. Manning, no pulse.

10:10.435 --> 10:12.133
- Bag her.

10:13.482 --> 10:16.398
- Ivy...

10:16.441 --> 10:18.966
- Still no pulse.

10:19.009 --> 10:20.010
- Ivy.

10:20.054 --> 10:21.185
Ivy. Honey.

10:21.229 --> 10:22.796
- Asystole.

10:22.839 --> 10:25.929
- Take over compressions.

10:25.973 --> 10:27.757
Honey, hey.

10:27.801 --> 10:29.324
- Her pupils are fixed
and dilated.

10:29.367 --> 10:30.760
I am so sorry,

10:30.804 --> 10:32.196
but her aneurysm
must have ruptured.

10:32.240 --> 10:33.458
- No, but she's still--
she's still--

10:33.502 --> 10:34.895
- I'm sorry.
Your wife is gone.

10:34.938 --> 10:36.113
But we need
to get the baby out.

10:36.157 --> 10:38.420
It still has a chance.
Okay?

10:38.463 --> 10:40.465
We got four minutes.
- Start the four minute clock.

10:40.509 --> 10:42.206
- Can't wait.

10:42.250 --> 10:43.555
I need to do
the C-section myself.

10:43.599 --> 10:45.340
- Angel,
take over compressions.

10:45.383 --> 10:46.558
- Ivy. Ivy.

10:46.602 --> 10:49.257
Honey.
- Diane, get OB here.

10:49.300 --> 10:51.476
- Sir, I need you to step out

10:51.520 --> 10:53.217
so we can deliver this baby.
- Wait a minute.

10:53.261 --> 10:55.829
Please save our baby.
Please.

10:55.872 --> 10:57.178
- Get me a scalpel.

11:00.224 --> 11:01.922
â™ª

11:01.965 --> 11:04.054
- Scalpel.

11:04.098 --> 11:08.798
â™ª

11:12.759 --> 11:13.063
.

11:15.892 --> 11:22.856
â™ª

11:22.899 --> 11:25.510
- Okay.

11:25.554 --> 11:28.252
Suction.

11:32.300 --> 11:35.999
She's cyanotic.

11:36.043 --> 11:38.393
- Ready to transfer.

11:41.831 --> 11:44.965
Angel?

11:47.054 --> 11:48.751
Sats at 78.

11:48.795 --> 11:53.756
- She's still unresponsive.
I might need to intubate.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.584
- Hold on.

11:55.627 --> 11:57.499
Sats at 88 and climbing.

11:57.542 --> 11:58.892
Heart rate 160.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.807
- She's coming around.
- Call Neonatology.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.460
Have them come meet us
in the NICU.

12:02.504 --> 12:03.766
- I'm on it.
- Keep stimulating.

12:03.810 --> 12:06.726
I want this baby alert
and moving.

12:11.818 --> 12:13.733
Tell me.

12:13.776 --> 12:16.692
- You have a little baby girl.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.389
We were able to get her out
in time,

12:18.433 --> 12:22.959
but she does need
to go up to the NICU.

12:23.003 --> 12:26.397
If you would like to spend
some time with your wife...

12:28.443 --> 12:32.752
Monique can take you up
when you're ready.

12:32.795 --> 12:36.799
I am so sorry for your loss.

12:47.723 --> 12:50.073
- Ethan! Ethan.

12:50.117 --> 12:51.901
Hey.
- Vicki.

12:51.945 --> 12:54.034
- I heard there was a--a
shooting at the hospital.

12:54.077 --> 12:56.601
They said a nurse was injured.
It wasn't April, was it?

12:56.645 --> 12:58.734
- Yeah, it was.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.824
She wasn't badly hurt.

13:01.868 --> 13:03.783
- Ethan, I--
- Vicki.

13:03.826 --> 13:06.481
It's over between April and me.

13:08.396 --> 13:09.963
I mean, I know
it can't be easy.

13:10.006 --> 13:12.313
You see her every day
and I completely understand--

13:12.356 --> 13:13.880
- It's over.

13:17.013 --> 13:18.580
Okay?

13:21.539 --> 13:23.846
Gotta get back to work.

13:23.890 --> 13:25.848
- Okay.

13:25.892 --> 13:28.024
I'll see you for dinner.

13:28.068 --> 13:30.374
- Yeah.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.827
- Monique.

13:47.870 --> 13:50.438
Did the shooter Dennis Mitchell
look familiar to you?

13:50.481 --> 13:53.006
- I didn't really
get a good look at him.

13:53.049 --> 13:57.532
- Turns out he was
a patient here.

13:57.575 --> 13:58.881
- Oh, my God.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.622
Maggie, I do remember him.

14:00.665 --> 14:02.580
- Yeah.

14:11.938 --> 14:14.418
- Your work-up is negative.

14:14.462 --> 14:15.898
He's cleared for you
to lock him up.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.813
- I'll call Burgess.
We'll get him out of here.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.860
- Dr. Choi, he was complaining
about his left hand.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.731
Said it feels funny.

14:24.472 --> 14:27.779
- It feels dead.

14:30.739 --> 14:32.654
- Pulse is diminished.

14:32.697 --> 14:33.916
It's a soft sign
for a humerus fracture.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.571
The artery needs
to be evaluated.

14:39.661 --> 14:42.446
Can't release him yet.

14:46.973 --> 14:50.193
- Dr. Charles, Dennis Mitchell
was a patient here.

14:50.237 --> 14:52.892
- Six months ago.

14:52.935 --> 14:55.590
He came in with an infection
after some plastic surgery.

14:55.633 --> 14:56.896
Monique was his nurse.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.898
She asked to be replaced
by a male nurse

14:58.941 --> 15:00.725
after Mr. Mitchell
made a pass at her

15:00.769 --> 15:01.944
insisting they go out.

15:01.988 --> 15:05.730
- Huh. Okay, thank you.
- Yeah.

15:05.774 --> 15:07.994
- And order a CTA of his
left subclavian artery.

15:08.037 --> 15:10.083
- Hey, you do realize
it's upsetting to everyone

15:10.126 --> 15:11.823
he's still in the hospital.
- Can't help that.

15:11.867 --> 15:12.999
- It looks like you're
bending over backwards

15:13.042 --> 15:14.609
to keep him here.

15:14.652 --> 15:16.002
Are all these tests
really necessary?

15:16.045 --> 15:18.091
- He shot you, April.
He could have killed you.

15:18.134 --> 15:19.483
- I know that.
- Don't tell me

15:19.527 --> 15:21.485
how to practice medicine.

15:23.052 --> 15:24.575
- Okay.

15:24.619 --> 15:25.968
- Hey, Maggie,
I just heard about April.

15:26.012 --> 15:27.100
Is she doing all right?

15:27.143 --> 15:28.188
- She says she's okay.

15:28.231 --> 15:29.580
Back at work.

15:29.624 --> 15:31.104
- Yeah, what a thing
to go through.

15:31.147 --> 15:33.149
- Yeah.

15:33.193 --> 15:34.977
- Congratulations.

15:35.021 --> 15:37.675
Front page of the "Metro."
Wow.

15:37.719 --> 15:38.807
Well, I'm sorry we don't have

15:38.850 --> 15:40.243
any cases worthy of your talent

15:40.287 --> 15:41.723
but since you're still
a trauma surgeon

15:41.766 --> 15:44.987
on my service...

15:45.031 --> 15:46.858
Kid in Five.

15:46.902 --> 15:50.514
Goofing around with a nail gun,
put one in his chest.

15:53.082 --> 15:54.910
- Hello, Mr. Bennett.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.739
Hey, Davey.
I'm Dr. Rhodes.

15:57.782 --> 16:00.133
- No.

16:00.176 --> 16:02.483
No, you're not.
- No, your dad is right.

16:02.526 --> 16:04.006
We're gonna fix you up
as good as new.

16:04.050 --> 16:06.052
- I thought the nail gun
was out of reach.

16:06.095 --> 16:07.662
I should have been
more careful.

16:07.705 --> 16:09.751
- Really, he's gonna be fine.

16:09.794 --> 16:13.668
So I see that Dr. Lanik
gave him some morphine.

16:13.711 --> 16:14.843
How you feeling, Davey?

16:14.886 --> 16:17.150
- It hurts when I breathe.

16:17.193 --> 16:18.151
- My poor boy.

16:18.194 --> 16:19.717
- Well, that makes sense.

16:19.761 --> 16:21.197
According to your X-ray,

16:21.241 --> 16:23.678
the nail hit a rib.

16:23.721 --> 16:25.027
- His vitals are fine.

16:25.071 --> 16:26.986
There's no obvious blood
in his chest.

16:27.029 --> 16:29.118
If you were an adult
I would take the nail out

16:29.162 --> 16:30.163
right here and now.

16:30.206 --> 16:31.686
But given Davey's age,

16:31.729 --> 16:32.992
I would rather do it
up in the OR.

16:33.035 --> 16:34.776
- So it is serious.

16:34.819 --> 16:37.257
- Dad, I don't want a surgery.
- No, no, no, no, no.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.955
I just think that Davey
would be more comfortable

16:39.999 --> 16:42.175
if he were under
general anesthetic

16:42.218 --> 16:44.873
so as soon as an OR is open
and it's ready,

16:44.916 --> 16:47.093
I'm gonna take you upstairs,
all right?

16:47.136 --> 16:50.792
And in the meantime, um,

16:50.835 --> 16:54.578
I would try and stop
worrying so much, okay?

16:54.622 --> 16:56.580
And you, I'm gonna get you
something

16:56.624 --> 16:57.886
to make you feel
a little better.

16:57.929 --> 17:00.323
So you hang in there, okay?

17:03.587 --> 17:05.154
- Dr. Charles, I, uh,

17:05.198 --> 17:06.938
I have the stuff on the shooter
that you asked for.

17:06.982 --> 17:09.071
- Oh, great.

17:09.115 --> 17:11.117
Well, wait.
Where you going?

17:11.160 --> 17:13.771
I don't know how to work these.

17:13.815 --> 17:15.077
Have a seat.

17:15.121 --> 17:17.079
- Okay.

17:22.258 --> 17:24.782
- Man, PhD and an MD
at the same time?

17:24.826 --> 17:25.783
I mean, no wonder
you're exhausted.

17:25.827 --> 17:27.176
I can only imagine.

17:27.220 --> 17:29.352
- Yeah, well, I'm used to
working hard.

17:29.396 --> 17:31.572
- Yeah, clearly.
Show me.

17:31.615 --> 17:33.269
- Okay. So, um...

17:33.313 --> 17:37.099
Dennis Mitchell has a history
on various message boards.

17:37.143 --> 17:38.840
He calls himself an "incel,"

17:38.883 --> 17:40.929
an involuntary celibate.

17:40.972 --> 17:43.888
Loser guys who think women
are unjustly denying them sex.

17:43.932 --> 17:46.239
- Yeah, ironically, the term
was coined by a woman.

17:46.282 --> 17:48.154
She started a website
for lonely people.

17:48.197 --> 17:50.243
- Uh, this is one
of his first entries.

17:50.286 --> 17:51.809
"I can't attract girls.

17:51.853 --> 17:53.985
My legs are skinny.
My chest is weak."

17:54.029 --> 17:56.292
Then he posts pictures.

17:56.336 --> 18:00.296
And, um, some guy named Apeman
writes back...

18:00.340 --> 18:02.777
- "Bro, this is fixable.

18:02.820 --> 18:05.171
Pectoral augmentation.
Calf augmentation."

18:05.214 --> 18:07.956
- Yep, then he spends
over $10,000 on surgeries.

18:07.999 --> 18:09.958
Um, rhinoplasty,
the chin implant,

18:10.001 --> 18:11.351
it's unbelievable.
He...

18:11.394 --> 18:13.048
He thinks this will make him
more desirable.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.789
- Yeah. People who
don't feel loved

18:14.832 --> 18:16.095
will do some crazy things.

18:16.138 --> 18:17.661
- Well, it didn't work.

18:17.705 --> 18:19.098
This is him a month ago.

18:19.141 --> 18:20.882
"No matter what I do,

18:20.925 --> 18:24.146
"Women deprive me of my right
to sexual pleasure.

18:24.190 --> 18:27.280
They are the enemy
and it's time to get even."

18:27.323 --> 18:29.282
Then he posted this yesterday.

18:29.325 --> 18:33.155
- I'm 28 years old
and I'm still a virgin.

18:33.199 --> 18:35.288
Women treat me like I'm scum.

18:35.331 --> 18:39.118
I will slaughter them.
I am the true alpha male.

18:39.161 --> 18:42.860
And I will make them pay.

18:44.210 --> 18:45.776
- It's an epidemic.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.694
- Loneliness.

18:54.872 --> 18:58.180
- Despite the intubation,
she's still not oxygenating.

18:58.224 --> 19:01.009
- I'm hearing a Grade 3
systolic ejection murmur.

19:01.052 --> 19:04.273
- EKG shows left ventricular
hypertrophy.

19:04.317 --> 19:08.364
Samantha, transducer.

19:14.457 --> 19:16.198
- Tricuspid atresia.

19:16.242 --> 19:20.724
- And an atrial septal defect.

19:20.768 --> 19:23.031
Do you want to tell
the father, or should I?

19:23.074 --> 19:24.728
- I will.

19:41.354 --> 19:45.271
- We never should have tried
to have kids.

19:45.314 --> 19:50.014
But Ivy wanted a baby so badly.

19:50.058 --> 19:52.147
And now she's gone.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.236
- I'm so sorry.

19:54.280 --> 19:57.761
There is something I need
to discuss with you.

19:57.805 --> 19:59.372
We've examined
your little girl--

19:59.415 --> 20:01.287
- Sophie.

20:01.330 --> 20:04.028
We were gonna name her Sophie.

20:04.072 --> 20:06.248
- There's a problem
with Sophie's heart.

20:06.292 --> 20:08.729
It's missing
its tricuspid valve.

20:08.772 --> 20:11.471
Normally the valve opens
and closes like a door.

20:11.514 --> 20:13.255
But Sophie's door is closed.

20:13.299 --> 20:16.040
So when she's a little bigger,
she'll need a surgery.

20:16.084 --> 20:17.520
But in the meantime,
she needs an operation

20:17.564 --> 20:19.435
called pulmonary artery band.

20:19.479 --> 20:21.959
It's urgent.
- Urgent.

20:25.963 --> 20:27.878
- Yes.

20:27.922 --> 20:30.838
Thank you.
- Yeah.

20:30.881 --> 20:33.014
- Doctor...

20:33.057 --> 20:37.148
please save my little girl.

20:46.288 --> 20:46.462
.

20:46.506 --> 20:48.508
- Natalie. Trauma Two.

20:49.639 --> 20:50.727
- Just go in.

20:50.771 --> 20:54.165
- Okay.
- Yeah.

21:06.352 --> 21:09.224
- Natalie.

21:09.268 --> 21:12.314
- Agent Lee said
you were coming back.

21:12.358 --> 21:15.535
I didn't know it was today.

21:15.578 --> 21:17.232
- Yeah.

21:19.843 --> 21:24.631
- I have been so angry at you.

21:24.674 --> 21:29.157
- I don't blame you.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.854
I'm sorry.

21:30.898 --> 21:33.814
For...everything.
All of it.

21:37.861 --> 21:40.908
- I didn't know how I'd feel
when I saw you.

21:48.524 --> 21:50.657
- Will.

21:54.269 --> 21:57.968
I've missed you so much.

21:58.012 --> 22:00.971
- It was terrible without you.

22:01.015 --> 22:04.497
Oh, I thought about this moment
every day.

22:04.540 --> 22:08.239
- You're really here.

22:13.810 --> 22:20.861
â™ª

22:23.429 --> 22:25.344
- All right.
An OR opened up.

22:25.387 --> 22:26.997
What do you say we get that
nail out of your chest, huh?

22:27.041 --> 22:29.391
- I don't want an operation.

22:29.435 --> 22:30.479
Can't you just give me
some medicine?

22:30.523 --> 22:31.915
- He's really scared.

22:31.959 --> 22:33.526
- You're gonna be asleep.
It won't hurt a bit.

22:33.569 --> 22:34.788
I promise you.
- I tell you what.

22:34.831 --> 22:36.529
How 'bout if I'm
right there with you?

22:36.572 --> 22:37.617
- Uh, Mr. Bennett, I--
I'm sorry, but that's not--

22:37.660 --> 22:39.358
- I want my daddy.

22:39.401 --> 22:40.750
- I've heard of parents
in the operating room

22:40.794 --> 22:42.578
with their kids.
- It's not a common practice,

22:42.622 --> 22:43.753
and really it's only while
the child's being put under.

22:43.797 --> 22:45.494
- Okay, that's fine.

22:45.538 --> 22:46.887
Please.

22:46.930 --> 22:48.541
I am all he has.

22:48.584 --> 22:51.935
It's just the two of us
since his mom died.

22:53.894 --> 22:55.722
- Yeah. Okay.

22:55.765 --> 22:58.464
But just until he's asleep.

22:58.507 --> 23:02.424
Okeydokey, let's go.

23:06.776 --> 23:09.910
- Sophie did really well.

23:09.953 --> 23:12.260
She'll need to stay here
for a couple more weeks

23:12.303 --> 23:13.914
and then you can take her home.

23:13.957 --> 23:15.655
Until she's big enough
to tolerate the surgery.

23:15.698 --> 23:17.308
- She's so little.

23:17.352 --> 23:21.312
- Yeah, but she's gonna
be fine.

23:24.054 --> 23:27.014
Is there anyone you would
like us to call for you?

23:27.057 --> 23:28.972
Family

23:29.016 --> 23:31.497
- My wife's family, I...

23:31.540 --> 23:32.889
I still have to tell them.

23:34.064 --> 23:35.370
Can they come be with you?

23:35.414 --> 23:36.937
- No, we just moved to Chicago.

23:36.980 --> 23:38.417
- Is there anyone local

23:38.460 --> 23:39.940
who could help you
with the arrangements?

23:39.983 --> 23:41.463
- No.

23:41.507 --> 23:43.813
I know hardly anyone here.

23:43.857 --> 23:45.772
- I'll get you
some information.

23:45.815 --> 23:48.470
Okay?
- Thank you.

23:50.864 --> 23:53.388
- So we watched
the last video you posted.

23:53.432 --> 23:56.478
Where you said
you wanted revenge.

23:56.522 --> 23:58.611
- People should pay
for what they did to me.

24:03.354 --> 24:05.444
- I'm sorry, Mr. Mitchell.
Um...

24:05.487 --> 24:08.316
So obviously, you feel
like you've been wronged.

24:08.359 --> 24:11.798
What I'm curious about is
if you're experiencing any...

24:11.841 --> 24:15.541
any regret
for what you did today.

24:15.584 --> 24:17.456
- Yeah.

24:17.499 --> 24:19.762
I have regrets.

24:19.806 --> 24:21.590
I wish I'd killed them all.

24:21.634 --> 24:23.113
- You're disgusting.

24:23.157 --> 24:24.811
You are. You're--
- Ms. Curry.

24:24.854 --> 24:25.942
- Pathetic, you're lonely--
- Ms. Curry, enough.

24:25.986 --> 24:27.509
- Nobody loves you, poor you.

24:27.553 --> 24:28.510
- You shut up!
- That doesn't give you

24:28.554 --> 24:29.511
the right to shoot people

24:29.555 --> 24:31.121
except maybe yourself!

24:33.559 --> 24:34.951
- What--what the hell
are you doing?

24:34.995 --> 24:36.562
- How could you
take his side in there?

24:36.605 --> 24:38.912
"Obviously you feel like
you've been wronged?"

24:38.955 --> 24:40.566
- I'm not taking his side.

24:40.609 --> 24:41.784
I'm trying to determine

24:41.828 --> 24:43.482
if he feels remorse
for his actions.

24:43.525 --> 24:44.657
- I hate him.
- Well, this isn't about you.

24:44.700 --> 24:46.093
This is a hospital.

24:46.136 --> 24:48.878
And that's a patient
who I'm trying to evaluate.

24:48.922 --> 24:50.619
A task you just made
infinitely more difficult.

24:50.663 --> 24:52.534
- No, you are not trying
to evaluate him.

24:52.578 --> 24:54.144
You're--you just are trying
to find some excuse

24:54.188 --> 24:55.668
so that he doesn't pay
for what he did.

24:55.711 --> 24:57.060
So that he doesn't
go to prison.

24:57.104 --> 25:00.150
- Miss Curry.
What he did was terrible.

25:00.194 --> 25:02.022
But as abhorrent
as we find his actions,

25:02.065 --> 25:03.589
our job is to try and
understand his mental state.

25:03.632 --> 25:05.068
- I don't know
what you want from me.

25:05.112 --> 25:07.636
All right? I--I--I am doing
the best that I can.

25:07.680 --> 25:10.509
I...

25:17.211 --> 25:19.735
Mr. Mitchell's scans.

25:19.779 --> 25:22.172
- Call Vascular, tell them
we're bringing a patient up.

25:22.216 --> 25:24.871
We need to take him
to surgery right now.

25:26.481 --> 25:29.571
One of your pectoral implants
damaged the axillary artery

25:29.615 --> 25:31.704
and you've developed what
we call a pseudoaneurysm.

25:31.747 --> 25:33.923
If it ruptures,
you could bleed to death.

25:39.973 --> 25:42.149
- Go.

25:52.942 --> 25:55.597
- Davey, can you
count down from ten?

25:55.641 --> 25:57.947
- Ten.

25:57.991 --> 26:00.123
Nine...

26:00.167 --> 26:02.082
- Okay, Beth,
why don't you show Mr. Bennett

26:02.125 --> 26:03.605
the waiting room?

26:03.649 --> 26:06.608
- Sir, let's have you
wait outside.

26:12.745 --> 26:15.138
- I'm in.

26:15.182 --> 26:16.879
- It's okay.

26:26.802 --> 26:29.805
- Airway pressures are up.

26:29.849 --> 26:31.677
Having trouble ventilating.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.635
- BP 88/60, heart rate 144.

26:35.289 --> 26:36.986
- No breath sounds on the left.
Tension to the thorax.

26:38.509 --> 26:39.641
- Get me a needle to decompress

26:39.685 --> 26:40.816
and open a chest tray.

26:40.860 --> 26:42.513
I'm guessing the nail poked

26:42.557 --> 26:44.037
a small hole in the lung

26:44.080 --> 26:45.168
and the pressure
from the ventilator

26:45.212 --> 26:46.605
is forcing air into his chest.

26:46.648 --> 26:47.867
- Uh--
- We can deal with it.

26:47.910 --> 26:49.085
- What--what are you
doing to him?

26:49.129 --> 26:50.173
- Sir--
- Dylan, I need you

26:50.217 --> 26:51.174
to get out of here.

26:51.218 --> 26:52.175
- I am not leaving!

26:52.219 --> 26:53.873
- Scalpel.
- Sir!

26:53.916 --> 26:56.615
Sir!
- Tube.

26:57.311 --> 26:58.834
- No. No, no, no, no.
- Sir, come!

26:58.878 --> 27:00.227
- No, take that out!
No, you are hurting him!

27:00.270 --> 27:01.837
- Stop! Let go!
- You're killing him!

27:01.881 --> 27:03.143
- Marty, help me!
- You are killing my son!

27:03.186 --> 27:05.928
- Come on--Marty--

27:15.068 --> 27:16.983
Call security and get him
out of here.

27:17.026 --> 27:18.549
He pushed the tube in too far.

27:18.593 --> 27:19.812
It caused a laceration
in the chest.

27:19.855 --> 27:21.552
We need to open Davey up.

27:21.596 --> 27:22.858
Hang a unit,
call the blood bank,

27:22.902 --> 27:25.861
and page Dr. Bekker,
I need her now.

27:30.170 --> 27:30.344
.

27:30.387 --> 27:32.346
- Watch his status, Marty.
Pressure's good.

27:32.389 --> 27:35.479
He's stable for now.

27:35.523 --> 27:38.657
- You allowed a parent
in the OR for a trauma case?

27:38.700 --> 27:41.137
- You can give me
the lecture later.

27:42.748 --> 27:45.098
- Chest tube lacerated
the left ventricle.

27:45.141 --> 27:47.709
I've got my finger in the dike,
I need you to sew.

27:51.452 --> 27:53.715
- Well, Daddy sure
cocked this up, didn't he?

27:53.759 --> 27:56.587
- Load up a 4-0 Prolene
with pledgets for Dr. Bekker.

27:56.631 --> 27:58.285
- All right.

27:59.416 --> 28:02.202
- Thanks.

28:18.740 --> 28:20.263
- Will.

28:20.307 --> 28:21.525
- Ah--
- Hey.

28:21.569 --> 28:23.005
- Sorry. Thanks.

28:23.049 --> 28:25.051
- Yeah, man.
Sorry.

28:25.094 --> 28:29.098
- Oh, just a little jumpy,
I guess.

28:30.665 --> 28:32.711
- Welcome back.

28:32.754 --> 28:34.756
- Yeah, thanks.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.151
- Phoenix.

28:38.194 --> 28:40.066
- Better weather
than Chicago, right?

28:40.109 --> 28:41.458
- I didn't get out much.

28:41.502 --> 28:44.548
They kept me pretty bottled up.

28:45.636 --> 28:46.681
- Hey.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.204
Just gotta look something up

28:48.248 --> 28:50.163
and then we can
get out of here, okay?

28:50.206 --> 28:51.294
- Yeah.

29:03.393 --> 29:06.396
- Mmm.

29:06.440 --> 29:09.617
I missed that.

29:11.053 --> 29:13.360
- Looking up funeral home
information.

29:13.403 --> 29:15.014
This guy just lost his wife

29:15.057 --> 29:17.451
and now their baby
is up in the NICU.

29:17.494 --> 29:20.454
- Ah, that's rough.
- Yeah.

29:20.497 --> 29:22.804
A single parent with a newborn?

29:22.848 --> 29:25.807
I know exactly
how he's feeling.

29:25.851 --> 29:28.114
It's not easy.

29:36.209 --> 29:39.168
I'll let him know.

29:39.212 --> 29:43.042
Dr. Choi.

29:43.085 --> 29:44.521
Vascular called.

29:44.565 --> 29:45.740
They were able to stent
Dennis Mitchell's

29:45.784 --> 29:47.089
axillary artery.

29:47.133 --> 29:48.656
He's headed to the ICU.

29:48.699 --> 29:50.832
Congratulations.
You saved his life.

29:53.269 --> 29:57.317
The first thing I wanted
was revenge.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.232
But I couldn't let myself
go there.

29:59.275 --> 30:01.712
Then I wouldn't be
any different than him.

30:01.756 --> 30:06.152
He hurt someone I care about.

30:06.195 --> 30:08.807
He hurt you.

30:13.812 --> 30:20.819
â™ª

30:21.645 --> 30:24.344
- Mr. Bennett.

30:24.387 --> 30:28.304
Davey is out of surgery
and he's gonna be fine.

30:28.348 --> 30:32.352
- Oh, thank God.

30:32.395 --> 30:34.397
I'm sorry.

30:34.441 --> 30:36.530
I am so sorry.
- Hey...

30:36.573 --> 30:38.706
you'll be able to see him soon.

30:38.749 --> 30:40.316
- Thank you.

30:40.360 --> 30:41.665
For everything.

30:44.930 --> 30:46.496
- You can give me
the lecture now.

30:46.540 --> 30:48.803
- Yeah, I could.
But your intentions were good.

30:48.847 --> 30:53.155
You couldn't know that Dad
would go mental.

30:53.199 --> 30:56.376
- Come with me tonight.

30:56.419 --> 30:58.813
- The board's gonna be there.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.684
That means your father's
gonna be there.

31:00.728 --> 31:02.295
- Oh, I know.
I've got a mental dad too.

31:02.338 --> 31:03.470
So what?

31:03.513 --> 31:05.167
- It's uncomfortable.

31:05.211 --> 31:06.560
Being around the two of you.

31:06.603 --> 31:08.475
- I know.

31:08.518 --> 31:10.607
But you can't
avoid him forever.

31:10.651 --> 31:12.914
You and I are a couple.

31:12.958 --> 31:16.178
With a future, right?

31:18.180 --> 31:19.442
- Between you and Dr. Choi,

31:19.486 --> 31:20.835
I've pulled
some overtime today.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.315
Thank you.

31:22.358 --> 31:23.664
- Any time.

31:23.707 --> 31:27.407
- You're not putting him
on a psych hold?

31:27.450 --> 31:28.712
- Miss Curry...

31:28.756 --> 31:29.844
stop by my office

31:29.888 --> 31:31.802
on your way out today,
would you?

31:31.846 --> 31:34.283
- Okay.

31:47.906 --> 31:51.822
Mr. Davis?

31:51.866 --> 31:54.913
Here's some funeral home
information.

31:54.956 --> 31:58.438
They'll handle everything.

31:58.481 --> 32:00.614
- Thank you.

32:00.657 --> 32:01.963
- There's really no reason
for you

32:02.007 --> 32:03.573
to stay here tonight.

32:03.617 --> 32:05.314
Why don't you go home?

32:05.358 --> 32:08.665
Try and get some sleep.

32:08.709 --> 32:12.234
- I don't want to go home.

32:14.584 --> 32:16.543
- You know, I...

32:16.586 --> 32:18.284
I was pregnant

32:18.327 --> 32:20.634
when my husband died.

32:20.677 --> 32:22.941
Your whole world falls apart.

32:22.984 --> 32:24.768
The person you loved so deeply,

32:24.812 --> 32:26.379
shared everything with,

32:26.422 --> 32:30.513
your worries, your sorrows,
your joys...

32:30.557 --> 32:32.385
is gone.

32:32.428 --> 32:34.909
And you feel so empty.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.738
And alone.

32:37.781 --> 32:39.479
But it will get better.

32:39.522 --> 32:41.916
I promise you.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.744
- Oh, my God.
Oh, God.

32:55.886 --> 32:58.019
- In his twisted way...

32:58.063 --> 32:59.499
with all his plastic surgery,

32:59.542 --> 33:00.891
Mr. Mitchell was trying
to make himself

33:00.935 --> 33:02.241
worthy of being loved.

33:02.284 --> 33:03.764
And, well...

33:03.807 --> 33:05.374
when he didn't get
that love, of course,

33:05.418 --> 33:07.681
he--he blamed others.

33:07.724 --> 33:08.769
- Of course.

33:08.812 --> 33:10.031
- Well, it's not atypical.

33:10.075 --> 33:11.990
You know, um, men do
tend to blame others

33:12.033 --> 33:13.426
for their depression

33:13.469 --> 33:14.993
and loneliness whereas women,

33:15.036 --> 33:17.430
sadly, are more likely
to blame themselves.

33:19.562 --> 33:22.609
- You had
a very strong reaction

33:22.652 --> 33:24.306
to Mr. Mitchell today.

33:24.350 --> 33:26.395
- Yeah, I mean,
who

33:26.439 --> 33:28.963
- Fair enough, but--
but it seemed to...

33:29.007 --> 33:31.748
really touch a nerve,
like it was almost...personal.

33:31.792 --> 33:33.359
- Sorry, I have--

33:33.402 --> 33:35.839
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

33:35.883 --> 33:38.451
- I'm seeing this
extraordinarily talented,

33:38.494 --> 33:40.801
brilliant, hardworking
young woman

33:40.844 --> 33:42.803
who is putting
an immense amount of pressure

33:42.846 --> 33:44.370
on herself to succeed.

33:44.413 --> 33:46.372
You know, she's not sleeping,

33:46.415 --> 33:48.287
she hasn't necessarily
plugged into a peer group

33:48.330 --> 33:52.421
for support--you know,
she's doing it alone.

33:52.465 --> 33:55.642
Elsa, for what it's worth,
I know a whole lot

33:55.685 --> 33:59.080
about depression
and loneliness.

33:59.124 --> 34:02.475
Okay?

34:02.518 --> 34:05.565
Have you ever had any thoughts
about hurting yourself?

34:05.608 --> 34:09.656
- No, I--no, I've never...I...

34:09.699 --> 34:11.658
no, I mean, how--you, you--

34:11.701 --> 34:13.399
you have no right to ask me
a question like that.

34:13.442 --> 34:14.965
I--I think maybe

34:15.009 --> 34:16.402
you're the one
with the problem.

34:16.445 --> 34:18.404
Not--not me.
I--

34:18.447 --> 34:20.101
Like, what kind of life
do you have?

34:20.145 --> 34:21.363
What kind of friends?

34:21.407 --> 34:23.452
You--you're here all the time.

34:23.496 --> 34:25.454
You've been divorced,
like, 50 times.

34:25.498 --> 34:26.934
You're--like, your last
resident hated you so much

34:26.977 --> 34:28.501
she moved to Texas.
I--I--

34:28.544 --> 34:30.807
I think you
are the expert

34:30.851 --> 34:33.375
on loneliness and depression,
okay?

34:44.038 --> 34:44.212
.

34:44.256 --> 34:46.388
- See you guys.

34:49.087 --> 34:51.611
Goodnight, April.

34:51.654 --> 34:53.308
- Goodnight, Ethan.

35:11.021 --> 35:13.154
Hey, Monique,
your shift is over.

35:13.198 --> 35:17.289
Why don't you go home?

35:17.332 --> 35:20.379
Monique?

35:20.422 --> 35:24.948
- I am so sorry
for what happened.

35:24.992 --> 35:28.169
I'm so sorry.

35:31.303 --> 35:34.436
- Okay, okay.
- I'm so sorry.

35:40.312 --> 35:43.924
- Out.
Everybody out now.

35:43.967 --> 35:46.187
Come on.

35:46.231 --> 35:47.710
- It's my fault.

35:47.754 --> 35:50.887
It's all my fault.

35:50.931 --> 35:52.715
- He could have killed you.

35:52.759 --> 35:54.413
If I just had coffee with him--

35:54.456 --> 35:55.414
- No.

35:55.457 --> 35:57.416
Monique. No.

35:57.459 --> 35:59.069
This had nothing
to do with you.

36:01.811 --> 36:04.858
- 'Cause I told him
to leave me alone.

36:04.901 --> 36:05.859
I didn't want anything
to do with him.

36:07.252 --> 36:09.210
Guys should shoot us
for turning them down?

36:09.254 --> 36:10.385
Come on.
- You do realize

36:10.429 --> 36:12.387
how crazy that sounds.

36:12.431 --> 36:14.737
Don't you?

36:17.914 --> 36:21.004
Come here.

36:21.048 --> 36:23.790
Is there someone at home
that can come and get you?

36:23.833 --> 36:25.095
- No.

36:27.359 --> 36:29.404
- I don't have any friends.

36:32.538 --> 36:34.931
- Yes you do.

36:34.975 --> 36:37.369
Look at us.

36:37.412 --> 36:39.806
You do.

36:43.853 --> 36:46.769
Yeah.
Come here.

36:54.081 --> 36:55.952
- I finally got Owen to sleep.

36:55.996 --> 36:58.259
He's so excited
to have you home.

36:58.303 --> 37:00.261
- Well, not as excited as me.
- Mmm.

37:00.305 --> 37:04.134
We have to get the wedding
back on the calendar.

37:04.178 --> 37:07.921
- Yes we do.

37:07.964 --> 37:11.011
- Oh, careful.

37:11.054 --> 37:12.447
Let me put this away.

37:14.449 --> 37:16.799
- Don't worry.
Owen can't get into it.

37:19.106 --> 37:20.455
- After everything
that happened,

37:20.499 --> 37:22.152
I thought we should
have some protection.

37:22.196 --> 37:23.980
- I can't believe this.

37:24.024 --> 37:26.287
- I have a permit.
- I don't care.

37:26.331 --> 37:28.333
You can't bring that thing
in our house.

37:28.376 --> 37:31.031
- Natalie, this is
for our protection.

37:31.074 --> 37:33.468
- Will, you used to hate guns.

37:33.512 --> 37:36.863
- That was before I had one
pointed at my head.

37:36.906 --> 37:38.125
- I'm sorry.

37:38.168 --> 37:41.868
But you cannot stay here
with that gun.

37:41.911 --> 37:44.479
I won't have it in this house.

37:49.832 --> 37:56.883
â™ª

38:02.410 --> 38:04.934
- We have a great reason
to celebrate tonight

38:04.978 --> 38:07.241
and I am delighted to see
all the members of our board,

38:07.285 --> 38:09.896
along with so many
of our generous supporters.

38:09.939 --> 38:12.333
Gaffney Medical Center
is on the cutting edge

38:12.377 --> 38:14.161
of urgent care,
due in large part

38:14.204 --> 38:16.598
to the men and women
who are here tonight.

38:16.642 --> 38:20.472
On behalf of them, I thank you.

38:27.174 --> 38:29.350
- Congratulations
to both of you.

38:29.394 --> 38:32.266
- And to you.

38:32.310 --> 38:35.182
- Don't you two look beautiful.

38:35.225 --> 38:36.575
I'm sorry, but, uh,

38:36.618 --> 38:38.316
I have to steal these two
for a minute.

38:41.014 --> 38:43.016
- They're gonna try
to sneak in some questions

38:43.059 --> 38:44.583
about the shooter.

38:44.626 --> 38:46.585
But we're not here about that.

38:46.628 --> 38:49.370
We're here about you.

38:49.414 --> 38:52.068
And your OR room.

38:57.073 --> 38:58.640
- Dr. Bekker.

38:58.684 --> 39:01.034
I love that perfume.

39:01.077 --> 39:03.558
Brings back such nice memories.

39:03.602 --> 39:06.996
Why don't we do it again?

39:07.040 --> 39:09.390
That was a very large check
I wrote you.

39:09.434 --> 39:11.044
I think I deserve
more than one night.

39:11.087 --> 39:13.307
- I disagree.

39:21.097 --> 39:23.186
- Thank you.
- Very nice to meet you.

39:23.230 --> 39:24.623
- I think we should go.

39:24.666 --> 39:26.886
- Your father.

39:34.676 --> 39:36.417
- The night that I went
to go see him

39:36.461 --> 39:38.463
to ask for money
for the hybrid room?

39:41.466 --> 39:42.684
- He's...

39:42.728 --> 39:44.425
he's now saying
the most hateful thing.

39:44.469 --> 39:47.167
He's--he's telling people
I slept with him.

39:52.128 --> 39:54.043
- Thank you.

39:55.262 --> 39:57.917
- Dr. Rhodes!

40:02.704 --> 40:05.620
What did she tell you?

40:05.664 --> 40:08.318
I can't wait to hear.

40:11.278 --> 40:13.280
- I should never
have made you come.

40:37.260 --> 40:44.311
