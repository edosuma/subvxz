00:01.960 --> 00:03.417
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:03.504 --> 00:04.836
It's a samurai.

00:04.922 --> 00:08.290
<i>Bring me the Flash,
or else your city falls.</i>

00:08.383 --> 00:09.919
Barry's still stuck in the Speed Force?

00:10.010 --> 00:12.002
I'm gonna get him out.
But I need your help.

00:13.889 --> 00:16.222
Barry? It's me, Iris.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.099
Loud, cloud, proud!

00:18.268 --> 00:19.304
Please come back to me.

00:19.770 --> 00:21.511
Barry, Iris is in trouble!

00:23.690 --> 00:24.680
Flash is back!

00:24.900 --> 00:27.734
<i>Flash, welcome home.</i>

00:27.986 --> 00:30.023
The Flash is back in Central City.

00:30.155 --> 00:31.521
You came back to me.

00:31.657 --> 00:33.774
<i>I'm not going
anywhere ever again.</i>

00:37.788 --> 00:41.702
Not only is this the most modern,
lavish penthouse on the market,

00:41.792 --> 00:44.034
it also has one of the best views
in all of Central City.

00:44.211 --> 00:45.668
Join me on the balcony.
See for yourself.

00:45.754 --> 00:47.416
I couldn't care less about the view.

00:48.340 --> 00:50.206
Is it your most expensive listing?

00:50.300 --> 00:52.792
- Yes, but the price is negotiable.
- I'll take it.

00:53.178 --> 00:54.214
Yes!

00:55.556 --> 00:57.969
Just let me lock up,
and I'll ride down with you.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.808
Sorry. Not sure
which button does what.

01:01.186 --> 01:02.597
Schmuck.

01:13.949 --> 01:15.156
Damn it.

01:17.202 --> 01:20.536
Dana. Yeah, listen,
I think I'm in some busted elevator...

01:22.916 --> 01:23.906
I don't know...

01:29.089 --> 01:30.079
No.

02:12.716 --> 02:15.834
<i>Just take those old records
Off the shelf</i>

02:16.595 --> 02:19.633
<i>I'll sit and listen
To 'em by myself</i>

02:20.432 --> 02:23.721
<i>Today's music
Ain't got the same soul</i>

02:24.311 --> 02:27.349
<i>I like that old-time rock 'n' roll</i>

02:28.148 --> 02:31.141
<i>Don't try to take me to a disco</i>

02:31.943 --> 02:35.061
<i>You'll never even get me
Out on the floor</i>

02:36.031 --> 02:38.694
<i>In ten minutes I'll be late for the door</i>

02:39.826 --> 02:42.534
<i>I like that old-time rock 'n' roll</i>

02:52.923 --> 02:54.289
<i>What?</i>

02:54.800 --> 02:55.916
Whoa.

02:56.259 --> 02:58.171
No...

02:59.221 --> 03:01.304
- Barry. Hi.
- Hey.

03:01.932 --> 03:02.968
- You're up early.
- Yeah.

03:03.058 --> 03:04.219
Doing what, exactly?

03:04.309 --> 03:06.642
I'm just catching up on
all the TV I missed

03:06.770 --> 03:08.102
while I was stuck in the Speed Force.

03:08.188 --> 03:11.056
When you've been gone six months,
the world is a minefield of spoilers.

03:11.149 --> 03:12.139
But Cisco hooked me up

03:12.234 --> 03:15.022
with a 1,000-times sped up version
of my favorite shows.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.061
Jon Snow died. Oh, he's alive.

03:18.573 --> 03:20.986
And here I was thinking you'd need
a jump-start for your loopy brain.

03:21.076 --> 03:23.363
Nope. Brain good. All of me is good.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.113
Joe needs me. Crime scene.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.164
That's okay.
I should probably get started

03:29.251 --> 03:31.117
on our neglected wedding plans.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.749
It's gonna take me forever
to get through this binder. So...

03:33.839 --> 03:36.422
No, don't worry about it.
I'm done with it.

03:36.591 --> 03:37.877
- You're done?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

03:38.176 --> 03:40.634
I locked in a caterer,
I got you your favorite flowers.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.963
I put a deposit on a venue
with an amazing view.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.218
I got that seven-tier
raspberry chocolate cake.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.637
Well, I guess you've got
everything covered.

03:47.728 --> 03:50.596
So, my lovely fiancée
can remain stress-free.

03:51.648 --> 03:52.638
Save me a bear claw?

03:52.733 --> 03:55.692
Oh, no promises, Speedster.
You whoosh, you lose.

04:01.450 --> 04:04.488
- What do we got, Joe?
- Not much to go off.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.615
The only witness
was an elderly resident,

04:06.705 --> 04:08.992
and she's still pretty rattled.

04:09.666 --> 04:10.873
Hey.

04:10.959 --> 04:14.669
Mr. Allen. Six months
and five minutes late.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.041
Sorry, Captain Singh.

04:16.130 --> 04:18.418
Thank you again for granting me
that extended sabbatical.

04:18.507 --> 04:19.999
But I'm back, I'm ready to work,

04:20.093 --> 04:22.005
and what can I say?
It's a beautiful day.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.178
Sorry. What are we dealing with?

04:24.264 --> 04:25.800
Well, I hope you had
a light breakfast.

04:25.891 --> 04:28.884
No, I had a good spread, actually.
Pancakes, sausage, fruity cereal...

04:32.147 --> 04:33.308
Whoa.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.186
He's everywhere.

04:37.486 --> 04:40.604
Far as we can tell,
it dropped him 100 stories.

04:41.239 --> 04:42.400
Were you able to ID the vic?

04:42.574 --> 04:45.908
Yeah. Kurt Weaver.
Worth billions. Capital "B."

04:46.244 --> 04:47.860
What do you think, Mr. Allen?

04:47.954 --> 04:50.412
You see the impacts on the ceiling?

04:50.540 --> 04:53.157
And the repeated
lateral stress fissures on the frame?

04:53.251 --> 04:57.541
This guy didn't just drop,
he was shaken to death.

04:58.089 --> 05:01.207
Excuse me. Coming through.
CCPD Tech Consultant.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.884
That's right. Look at the badge,
that means it's official.

05:04.054 --> 05:06.171
He's aware that badge is plastic, right?

05:06.723 --> 05:08.589
Fellas. So sorry I'm late.

05:08.683 --> 05:10.845
The curls were not cooperating
this morning.

05:10.936 --> 05:13.644
Good Lord.
Why would you show me that?

05:14.397 --> 05:16.229
We think this is because of
some weird technical glitch.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.228
And you're our weird tech expert.

05:18.902 --> 05:21.144
It's completely ruined sriracha for me.

05:24.616 --> 05:25.652
Yoink.

05:27.202 --> 05:29.489
- That shouldn't be there.
- What is it?

05:29.996 --> 05:31.532
It's encrypted code.

05:33.375 --> 05:35.958
This wasn't a glitch. This was a hacker.

05:45.971 --> 05:49.180
The Cortex's quantum algorithm
should decrypt this code in no time.

05:49.266 --> 05:52.054
That should help us ID
our new hacker.

05:52.143 --> 05:55.181
But while we wait, I've got
a little welcome-back gift for you.

05:55.272 --> 05:58.811
Come, come. Walk with your boy.
Gather 'round, class.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.276
Kablam!

06:03.738 --> 06:05.570
I mean, that was a cool reveal
and everything,

06:05.657 --> 06:08.445
but I've seen that suit.
I've actually already worn it.

06:08.535 --> 06:12.449
Yeah. We all know you gave Barry's
suit a nice little fancy makeover.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.826
Yeah, but you don't know
what you don't know.

06:14.916 --> 06:19.081
And under all this red beautiful,
I've built in self-repairing armor,

06:19.212 --> 06:21.955
nano-liquid circuitry,
full-spectrum scanning,

06:22.048 --> 06:24.836
and a whole bunch of other big words.
Chief among them...

06:28.722 --> 06:30.429
Your very own custom-made HUD.

06:30.515 --> 06:33.804
This thing is loaded with maps,
schematics, delivery menus.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.226
<i>You know that Thai place
you love so much?</i>

06:35.312 --> 06:37.975
<i>- Yeah, the one with the pad see ew?
- You know how we pad see do.</i>

06:38.064 --> 06:41.057
<i>Dude, this is awesome.
What else does it do?</i>

06:41.151 --> 06:44.485
Well, lucky for you, I even wrote you
an instruction manual.

06:45.030 --> 06:47.443
- Yay!
- Come on, we're not cavemen.

06:48.909 --> 06:51.652
- Really good work.
<i>- I know!</i>

06:52.329 --> 06:53.410
I'll look at this later.

06:53.663 --> 06:56.371
Um, I gotta get back to CCPD.

06:56.458 --> 06:58.950
And you can blame this on Cisco,
but I'm thinking Thai tonight?

06:59.044 --> 07:01.878
Honestly, babe,
I'll probably be too tired to eat out

07:01.963 --> 07:03.420
after our evening training session.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.122
I canceled that.
Don't worry about that.

07:06.384 --> 07:07.374
You canceled it?

07:07.552 --> 07:09.544
Yeah, I mean,
I don't think we need it, right?

07:09.638 --> 07:11.721
Besides, I'm back.
I'll make a reservation, okay?

07:14.851 --> 07:16.717
It must be so nice having Barry back.

07:18.355 --> 07:20.221
Yeah. Yes, it is.

07:20.690 --> 07:21.931
But...

07:22.275 --> 07:23.732
Well, I mean,
it's just gonna take some time

07:23.818 --> 07:26.356
for him to get used to the new dynamics
around here, that's all.

07:26.571 --> 07:27.561
Yeah.

07:28.657 --> 07:30.148
You know, when Ronnie and I went from

07:30.241 --> 07:33.780
just working together
to working together and dating,

07:33.870 --> 07:35.406
we had some trouble communicating.

07:35.497 --> 07:37.955
I mean, Barry and I
communicate just fine.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.244
Yeah. I'm just saying,

07:40.210 --> 07:43.453
we actually went to couples therapy
and it really helped a lot.

07:43.630 --> 07:46.464
I appreciate the advice, Caitlin.
Really, I do.

07:46.591 --> 07:50.301
But, you know, Barry and I have
known each other since childhood.

07:50.637 --> 07:53.675
You know, we don't need therapy.
I mean...

07:54.391 --> 07:56.599
- We're Barry and Iris, right?
- Right.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.811
Thanks, though. I mean, I don't have
anything against it. It's just...

07:59.938 --> 08:01.395
You're Barry and Iris. Gotcha.

08:07.153 --> 08:09.770
Unauthorized breach incoming.
We gotta move.

08:10.365 --> 08:13.028
Don't change, don't change,
don't change, don't change...

08:14.369 --> 08:16.110
Caitlin, let's go!

08:24.462 --> 08:25.452
You ready?

08:26.715 --> 08:27.922
For anything.

08:29.217 --> 08:32.130
Hey, hey! Whoa, whoa! Hold your fire!

08:36.224 --> 08:38.341
- Hey.
- Girl...

08:38.893 --> 08:40.759
Hey, you wanna give me
a little more notice next time?

08:40.854 --> 08:42.846
You know people who want to kill us
come through here, right?

08:43.481 --> 08:44.847
Oh, my bad, guys.

08:45.316 --> 08:48.730
Cisco, that was very heroic of you
to just jump in,

08:48.820 --> 08:50.686
protecting Gypsy like that.
It's very impressive.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.732
Dude, I'm protecting you from her.
She would've vaporized you guys.

08:53.867 --> 08:54.857
Pfft.

08:55.577 --> 08:56.738
He's not lying.

08:58.580 --> 08:59.787
As you were.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.785
Okay.

09:02.917 --> 09:06.251
- So, you almost ready for our date?
- Yeah. Almost.

09:06.337 --> 09:07.453
Um...

09:07.547 --> 09:10.756
I hit a snag in trying to decrypt
this hacker code for the CCPD.

09:11.051 --> 09:14.010
I mean, you know how we do.
It's just kind of like <i>The Matrix...</i>

09:14.095 --> 09:15.336
You care about none of this.

09:15.430 --> 09:18.173
Just give me, like, one hour.
Two, tops. And then...

09:19.225 --> 09:21.182
It's you and me, promise.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.345
You're lucky you are so cute.

09:24.439 --> 09:26.681
- And you are amazing.
- Yeah.

09:26.816 --> 09:30.230
And you're so right
about the cute thing, too, huh.

09:31.196 --> 09:33.438
- BRB.
- Okay.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.412
Guys, there's a car going 120,
swerving between lanes.

10:23.498 --> 10:24.830
Someone's going to get killed.

10:24.916 --> 10:27.124
- You both need to get out there.
- That's one car. I got it.

10:27.335 --> 10:28.325
Yeah, but I can...

10:29.212 --> 10:30.419
I can help you.

10:38.930 --> 10:40.216
Help! Help!

10:45.103 --> 10:47.186
<i>Okay, guys, it's a runaway.
The driver's trapped inside.</i>

10:47.272 --> 10:48.558
<i>I'm gonna change his trajectory.</i>

10:48.648 --> 10:49.684
Okay. Then turn him left.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.523
There's a turn-off
for runaway trucks coming up.

10:51.693 --> 10:54.936
Just clear a path, and the car
will come to a safe stop there.

10:55.071 --> 10:56.312
<i>No, no, no,
I'm gonna push him right.</i>

10:56.406 --> 10:58.068
<i>That street's empty.
I can help him there.</i>

11:01.953 --> 11:03.444
<i>Barry, you can't go
down that road.</i>

11:03.538 --> 11:04.528
What? Why?

11:04.706 --> 11:07.449
Because they started construction
on that street three months ago.

11:10.795 --> 11:13.003
No, no, no, no, no.

11:49.417 --> 11:50.749
I know a guy almost died,

11:50.835 --> 11:54.795
but what happened to this sexy beast
here today is the real tragedy.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.167
It could've been a lot worse.

11:56.257 --> 11:58.499
I'm sorry, guys. This one is all on me.

11:58.593 --> 12:01.210
Okay, so, my dad talked to the driver,
Tim Kwon, he's fine.

12:01.304 --> 12:04.047
He's gonna question him and see
if they can figure out who did this.

12:04.140 --> 12:08.009
- Cisco, what do we got?
- Beginning auto-topsy, now.

12:12.273 --> 12:15.391
That is the same weird code
from the elevator murder scene.

12:15.485 --> 12:17.568
- Wait. Doesn't that mean...
- Our hacker's got a hit list.

12:17.737 --> 12:18.727
Can you crack it?

12:18.863 --> 12:21.105
Man, I've been trying to
crack this code all day.

12:21.199 --> 12:23.191
It looks like a virus.

12:23.368 --> 12:25.906
Well, yeah. Because it's
a computer virus. I mean...

12:25.995 --> 12:27.736
No, no, no. Scooch.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.196
<i>Oh, I feel violated.</i>

12:32.001 --> 12:35.460
- It looks like an organic virus.
- But with a digital sub-base.

12:35.546 --> 12:38.209
Our killer isn't just hacking
machines, he's controlling them.

12:38.299 --> 12:39.380
Our hacker's not a hacker.

12:39.467 --> 12:40.753
He's a meta.

12:41.219 --> 12:43.051
Is there a connection
between the two victims?

12:43.137 --> 12:44.594
There's nothing online.

12:44.764 --> 12:48.883
But their names, Weaver, Kwon,
they sound very familiar to me.

12:49.060 --> 12:51.723
I started collecting these tech
magazines in high school, they're...

12:51.854 --> 12:54.141
Those are the magazines
you collected in high school?

12:54.607 --> 12:58.021
Okay, that's hurtful.
That's really hurtful.

12:58.152 --> 13:01.441
Anyway, I'm 90% sure
that's where I read those names.

13:01.572 --> 13:02.938
Okay, great. Start digging.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.320
Barry, can I talk to you
for a second?

13:05.451 --> 13:06.487
Mm-hmm.

13:13.126 --> 13:17.040
Hey, about what happened, I'm sorry.
I should've listened to you.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.247
It's just sometimes when I'm out
there, things move so fast,

13:19.340 --> 13:21.127
and I'm really excited
to be the Flash again.

13:21.467 --> 13:22.457
Anyway, I hope you're not mad.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.377
And you are. You're mad, aren't you?

13:25.555 --> 13:26.671
No, no. I'm not mad.

13:26.848 --> 13:30.262
I just think with us being engaged,
and now we're working together,

13:30.351 --> 13:33.719
that it's more important than ever
that we communicate.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.307
I completely agree.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.306
Good. Because Caitlin mentioned
something earlier,

13:37.400 --> 13:40.564
and I sort of dismissed it. But now, I'm
really thinking that it could help us.

13:40.653 --> 13:41.643
What is it?

13:42.655 --> 13:43.645
Couples therapy.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.323
- Couples therapy? You...
- Mm-hmm.

13:46.826 --> 13:50.410
- We're not, like, in trouble, are we?
- No, no. No, of course not.

13:50.496 --> 13:55.491
I just think that any couple
that's doing everything we're doing

13:55.585 --> 13:57.702
could use some advice.

13:58.212 --> 13:59.202
Mm-hmm.

13:59.756 --> 14:01.167
We're just talking about a tune-up.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.499
I mean,
there's nothing wrong with that, right?

14:04.469 --> 14:06.131
A tune-up. Right, yeah. I mean...

14:06.220 --> 14:08.678
Sure. If it's what you wanna do,
then sure, yeah. Let's try it.

14:08.765 --> 14:11.758
Great. 'Cause we've got an appointment
in 30 minutes. I'll get my purse.

14:13.561 --> 14:14.847
What?

14:26.199 --> 14:27.406
Later.

14:29.452 --> 14:31.284
- Hi. Iris?
- Hi.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.987
- Hi, Barry.
- Hello.

14:33.081 --> 14:35.289
Hi, I'm Dr. Sharon Finkel.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.992
I am so sorry I kept you waiting.

14:38.086 --> 14:40.669
No, no. It's fine.
Thank you for squeezing us in.

14:40.755 --> 14:43.623
Well, you made it sound so urgent
on the phone.

14:43.716 --> 14:47.130
No. Not urgent.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.633
I'm excited. To dive in.

14:50.181 --> 14:53.515
- Right?
- Oh, absolutely. I love therapy.

14:53.684 --> 14:57.098
- Oh, have you been before?
- Just once. When I was a kid.

14:57.188 --> 14:59.646
- After my mom died.
<i>- Oh, your mom...</i>

15:02.276 --> 15:03.642
But I'm okay with that.

15:03.736 --> 15:07.901
I mean, I'm not okay with it, obviously.
I mean, I'd prefer that she was alive.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.572
I just meant that
I've already dealt with it.

15:09.659 --> 15:12.447
So, I don't think
it's worth writing down.

15:12.537 --> 15:16.406
These notes are just for me.
No one is judging you guys.

15:16.999 --> 15:18.581
Yes, we know.

15:18.668 --> 15:20.625
Well, my dad died, too.

15:20.711 --> 15:22.293
Just for your notes.

15:22.713 --> 15:25.421
So, Barry,
Iris filled me in a little bit

15:25.508 --> 15:27.795
about the two of you
on the phone before.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.509
<i>- Getting married.</i>
- Yeah.

15:30.221 --> 15:32.929
Yeah, it's been a long road,
getting here.

15:33.015 --> 15:36.474
First, us growing up together.

15:36.561 --> 15:39.599
And then I was engaged
to someone else.

15:40.314 --> 15:42.727
- Okay.
- That's worth a write-down.

15:43.317 --> 15:44.979
He's actually dead, too.

15:45.069 --> 15:47.482
You two have had to deal with
a lot of trauma.

15:47.572 --> 15:48.983
- Well...
- No, not...

15:49.073 --> 15:51.486
- Eddie and Ronnie.
- I mean, a little.

15:51.576 --> 15:53.818
- My mother, H.R.
- Not too much.

15:53.911 --> 15:55.618
- Laurel. Snart.
- Some.

15:55.705 --> 15:58.288
- We've been to a few funerals.
- Yeah.

15:58.875 --> 16:02.960
So, Barry, why do you think Iris
wanted you two to see me today?

16:03.045 --> 16:07.039
Well, Iris and I,
we recently started working together.

16:07.341 --> 16:10.175
You see, I went away for a while on a...

16:10.428 --> 16:11.714
- Business trip.
- Business trip.

16:11.888 --> 16:13.925
For six months.

16:14.056 --> 16:18.551
I guess now, yeah, we're just
learning to get back in sync.

16:18.686 --> 16:21.599
To sync up again. Is that right?

16:22.482 --> 16:24.565
Well, there's no right or wrong, Barry.

16:24.734 --> 16:26.066
Right.

16:26.235 --> 16:29.649
I think we could work on
listening a little bit more, right?

16:29.739 --> 16:30.729
Yeah.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.406
Or else, someone could get really hurt.

16:33.534 --> 16:37.073
Like if they crash their car into a
brick wall, going 100 miles per hour.

16:37.872 --> 16:39.829
She means that emotionally.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.581
Do I?

16:42.376 --> 16:45.960
Hello, <i>mamacita.</i> They don't
make 'em like you anymore.

16:46.047 --> 16:47.288
What the hell?

16:47.840 --> 16:51.459
Easy, it's just the Motherboard
of the Month, July of '07. Okay?

16:51.552 --> 16:54.010
- Look at her. Err.
- I kind of wish it was a girl.

16:54.096 --> 16:56.679
Baby, it's been hours. You guys
haven't made any progress yet?

16:56.807 --> 16:58.764
No mention of Kurt Weaver or Tim Kwon,

16:58.851 --> 17:00.387
or any connection
between the two of them.

17:00.478 --> 17:02.720
Until now. Got 'em.

17:02.897 --> 17:05.685
Take note, people. It's only hoarding
if it doesn't pay off.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.224
Okay, so, that's Tim Kwon,
that's Kurt Weaver,

17:08.319 --> 17:10.402
that's Sheila Agnani...

17:11.489 --> 17:12.479
Who's that guy?

17:15.409 --> 17:19.028
- Sorry about that.
- No. It's definitely my fault.

17:37.515 --> 17:39.882
You don't have any idea
who would want to do you harm?

17:40.685 --> 17:42.017
Not even a gut feeling?

17:42.603 --> 17:44.890
No. I mean, everyone loves
a billionaire, right?

17:46.315 --> 17:47.305
No, I have no idea.

17:48.985 --> 17:50.726
Grenade! Everybody, move!

18:07.461 --> 18:10.829
<i>So, what would you say
your goals are for this session?</i>

18:11.882 --> 18:14.625
Well, I just want to know that

18:14.719 --> 18:18.759
Barry hears my concerns about our
issues with miscommunication.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.049
- I gotta go.
- You gotta go?

18:23.060 --> 18:24.596
- He's gotta go.
- Yeah.

18:24.729 --> 18:27.938
Sorry. This was... Sorry.

18:29.483 --> 18:31.440
You're gonna write down that
he ran out of here, aren't you?

18:31.652 --> 18:32.642
Yes.

18:40.620 --> 18:41.610
Get down!

19:17.948 --> 19:19.234
Everybody okay?

19:20.534 --> 19:22.241
I don't know, it must've been a dud.

19:30.461 --> 19:32.874
Same corrupted code. Same guy.

19:33.089 --> 19:36.173
Someone very creatively tried to kill
Tim Kwon and Kurt Weaver.

19:36.258 --> 19:37.419
Where's Kwon now?

19:37.510 --> 19:39.376
He ran out of here,
scared out of his mind.

19:39.470 --> 19:41.382
He wouldn't even wait
for a protected escort.

19:41.472 --> 19:44.636
But the good news is, I found
a connection between our victims.

19:44.725 --> 19:46.967
Four years ago,
Kurt Weaver and Tim Kwon

19:47.103 --> 19:49.516
created an app in their garage
with two other programmers.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.141
Some kind of malware called Kilg%re.

19:51.232 --> 19:53.019
And then they sold it off
to a big tech company.

19:53.275 --> 19:54.811
So, that's how they made their money.

19:54.944 --> 19:56.105
I saw this guy. He was here.

19:56.821 --> 19:58.858
Ramsey Deacon.
Looks like we found our meta.

19:58.948 --> 20:01.065
And for some reason,
he's going after his old partners.

20:01.158 --> 20:02.274
It's like <i>Silicon Valley</i>

20:02.368 --> 20:04.906
if Richard went nuts and started
killing everyone at Pied Piper.

20:04.995 --> 20:08.534
I feel like he's got more of
an anarchist Gilfoyle vibe.

20:08.624 --> 20:09.614
Erlich, maybe.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.622
Guys, I love that we're so confident
in our ability to apprehend villains

20:12.712 --> 20:15.625
that we can have this debate,
but, hi, what about her?

20:15.798 --> 20:18.165
That's Sheila Agnani.
She's like a big deal tech guru now.

20:18.342 --> 20:20.959
She could be next on Deacon's list.
We'll definitely have to protect her.

20:21.137 --> 20:22.719
Yeah, well, my dad and Wally
can do that, right?

20:22.930 --> 20:23.920
- I'm on it.
- Great.

20:24.306 --> 20:26.047
- I'll keep working on the code.
- Sure.

20:27.309 --> 20:28.470
Sorry about therapy.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.892
It's okay. I told Dr. Finkel
that you had a work emergency.

20:31.981 --> 20:33.313
- True. Kind of.
- Yeah.

20:33.441 --> 20:35.774
And she had a cancellation
this afternoon,

20:35.860 --> 20:37.351
so, we should get over there.

20:37.528 --> 20:41.943
- Don't want to be late.
- No. Yeah, let's get back in there.

20:43.659 --> 20:47.403
This guy is a living computer virus.
That's a new one.

20:47.496 --> 20:50.785
Look at this code. From the elevator,
to the car, to the bomb robot,

20:50.875 --> 20:54.243
this code keeps changing,
but I can't figure out why.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.123
Okay, we have to remember
that it's not just digital,

20:56.213 --> 20:57.374
it's bio-digital.

20:57.590 --> 21:00.833
Most organic viruses mutate
to avoid being killed.

21:00.926 --> 21:03.669
So, if we manage to create
digital antibodies,

21:03.763 --> 21:04.924
then we can shut this guy down.

21:05.431 --> 21:06.638
Oh! Nice one!

21:07.475 --> 21:09.558
Hi.

21:09.643 --> 21:11.680
I'm so glad you're here.

21:11.812 --> 21:15.601
'Cause I truly, deeply,
from the bottom of my heart,

21:15.691 --> 21:16.852
I am sorry,

21:17.151 --> 21:20.019
but I'm gonna have to cancel our date.

21:21.238 --> 21:23.776
If you're gonna vi-blast me,
can I at least pick the spot?

21:24.867 --> 21:26.358
It's fine, Cisco.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.360
- I get it.
- You get it?

21:28.746 --> 21:30.408
Yeah, what's not to get?
You have to work, so...

21:31.874 --> 21:33.206
We will cancel our date.

21:33.751 --> 21:36.539
Well, good luck, you guys.
I hope it works out.

21:40.841 --> 21:44.710
What a cool chick.
She took that so well.

21:44.845 --> 21:46.302
No. No, she didn't.

21:47.556 --> 21:49.263
When a girl says she gets it,
what she really means

21:49.350 --> 21:51.057
is she doesn't get it at all.

21:51.852 --> 21:52.842
I'm confused.

21:53.687 --> 21:55.303
Don't be. Very simple.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.481
You, my friend, are in so much trouble.

22:02.196 --> 22:03.528
You just had to fall for the girl

22:03.614 --> 22:05.321
in head-to-toe black leather,
didn't you?

22:06.075 --> 22:09.409
We're back. That was quick. Even for me.

22:09.912 --> 22:10.902
That's funny.

22:11.205 --> 22:13.197
Inside joke between us.

22:13.874 --> 22:15.456
<i>Work emergency aside,</i>

22:15.751 --> 22:19.745
I have a sneaking suspicion that
you'd rather be somewhere else, Barry.

22:19.922 --> 22:22.710
No, no. I mean, we do have

22:23.801 --> 22:26.134
a big work thing
that we're dealing with.

22:26.220 --> 22:28.758
- It's important.
- Yeah, but so is this.

22:29.640 --> 22:32.553
You know, if we're not on the same page,
Barry, people could die.

22:33.269 --> 22:34.885
- Ah.
- Metaphorically.

22:38.732 --> 22:41.975
No. No, no, don't hold back.

22:42.069 --> 22:45.437
Turn to Iris, look her in the eyes,
and tell her what you wanted to say.

22:45.614 --> 22:47.981
I don't know... Well, I...

22:48.158 --> 22:51.196
I said I was sorry about this morning.

22:53.831 --> 22:56.869
Iris, turn to Barry. Talk to him.

22:59.128 --> 23:01.666
It's not just this morning, Barry.

23:01.755 --> 23:04.543
You canceled training the other day
without asking me.

23:04.675 --> 23:05.665
<i>Training?</i>

23:05.801 --> 23:06.791
- Swimming.
- For a marathon.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.843
It's a triathlon.

23:09.471 --> 23:12.555
Anyway, I didn't think canceling
training was that big of a deal.

23:12.766 --> 23:14.632
Yeah, but you made
all those wedding plans, too,

23:14.727 --> 23:16.138
and you didn't consult me.

23:16.478 --> 23:18.765
I was trying
to be a good fiancé.

23:18.856 --> 23:21.098
I'd think most brides would be happy

23:21.191 --> 23:23.274
that their future spouse cared about
helping with the wedding.

23:23.360 --> 23:24.771
That is a good thing, right?

23:26.322 --> 23:29.440
Look, I don't know... I mean,
I guess our wires have gotten crossed

23:29.533 --> 23:31.274
a few times the last few days,

23:31.410 --> 23:35.074
but I think that hardly rises
to the level of a crisis.

23:35.372 --> 23:37.079
After everything
we've been through together,

23:37.374 --> 23:40.538
you and me, we're Barry and Iris.
We're the gold standard.

23:40.669 --> 23:41.659
I am so in love with you...

23:41.754 --> 23:43.211
Then how could you leave me?

23:45.132 --> 23:48.216
You left me, Barry. You just left me.

23:49.011 --> 23:50.843
Standing there alone.

23:52.389 --> 23:54.005
How could you do that?

24:24.922 --> 24:26.788
All the listening devices are in place.

24:27.883 --> 24:31.092
Well, keep your ears open.
Gotta make sure she's safe.

24:32.596 --> 24:33.586
Yeah.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.636
What? I like punk music.

24:40.646 --> 24:41.727
Tim?

24:42.439 --> 24:44.180
What the hell, man?
You can't just come into my house.

24:44.274 --> 24:45.981
'Cause you wouldn't return my calls.
I really...

24:46.068 --> 24:48.151
If it's about your weird crush,
let it go, Tim.

24:48.237 --> 24:49.944
- We are not happening.
- Sheila, listen.

24:50.030 --> 24:51.146
Deacon's coming for us.

24:51.240 --> 24:52.856
He wants payback for
what we did to him.

24:52.950 --> 24:54.361
What did we do to him?

24:54.451 --> 24:56.283
Kurt scrubbed any connection
between us from the net.

24:56.370 --> 24:58.783
So, as far as the world's concerned,
we're innocent.

24:58.872 --> 24:59.862
But we're not.

25:00.374 --> 25:02.457
I should have never let you talk me
into going along with this.

25:02.543 --> 25:04.000
And now, Kurt's dead.

25:04.086 --> 25:05.076
Deacon killed him.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.787
- He did not.
- Oh, yes.

25:09.091 --> 25:10.207
He did.

25:19.143 --> 25:21.886
Well, this is a nice house.
How much did you pay for it?

25:22.604 --> 25:23.594
Ten mil?

25:23.689 --> 25:25.646
Let's talk about this.
We can make it right.

25:25.816 --> 25:27.182
Shut up, Tim!

25:28.235 --> 25:31.899
You could have had all this, too.
This all could have been yours.

25:32.239 --> 25:34.356
Kilg%re was my idea.

25:34.700 --> 25:36.737
And you three stole it away from me.

25:36.827 --> 25:38.113
Somebody had to.

25:38.245 --> 25:40.487
Otherwise, it would have just been
a halfway clever idea

25:40.664 --> 25:41.996
that died in someone's garage.

25:42.124 --> 25:43.285
- Sheila...
- No. I'm not

25:43.417 --> 25:45.704
going to apologize
because after four years,

25:45.878 --> 25:47.710
you finally found some balls.

25:47.796 --> 25:48.877
I found something else.

25:48.964 --> 25:52.048
Something I never had with my family
or at MIT,

25:52.301 --> 25:54.213
- or with any of you.
- Really?

25:54.386 --> 25:55.376
And what was that?

25:56.013 --> 25:57.003
Power.

26:00.642 --> 26:02.304
You're not still diabetic, are you?

26:06.231 --> 26:08.564
Those new computer-controlled
insulin pumps

26:09.318 --> 26:11.150
are a real lifesaver.

26:11.612 --> 26:12.819
Way too much insulin...

26:13.614 --> 26:15.105
Well, that can be lethal.

26:17.826 --> 26:19.442
And how should we kill you?

26:31.173 --> 26:32.414
He put her in insulin shock.

26:36.345 --> 26:37.335
Glucose.

26:44.728 --> 26:47.186
Deacon took him.
He took Tim.

26:58.200 --> 26:59.281
No sign of Deacon or Kwon

26:59.368 --> 27:01.485
on facial recognition,
traffic cameras, nothing.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.820
We don't even know
if Kwon is still alive.

27:03.997 --> 27:05.488
We gotta move fast.

27:08.335 --> 27:09.325
Where were you two?

27:10.420 --> 27:12.753
- Dry cleaners.
- Wedding... Cleaners. Dry cleaners.

27:14.299 --> 27:18.839
Cisco, where are you
with those bio-digital antibodies?

27:18.929 --> 27:19.919
<i>I'm nowhere.</i>

27:20.097 --> 27:22.259
Actually, no, you know what?
I am somewhere.

27:22.349 --> 27:23.339
I'm in the doghouse.

27:23.642 --> 27:26.100
Apparently,
the pan-dimensional doghouse.

27:26.186 --> 27:28.143
I don't know if this doghouse
has a door or a window.

27:28.230 --> 27:29.892
But if it did, I'd be jumping out of it!

27:30.065 --> 27:31.806
It's okay, I'll go talk to him.

27:41.910 --> 27:43.697
Has everybody lost their minds?

27:45.247 --> 27:48.786
She must think I'm blowing her off,
but I'm just trying to do my job.

27:48.876 --> 27:51.664
I guess the word "reschedule"
doesn't exist on Earth-19.

27:51.837 --> 27:53.829
Okay, I'm gonna go out on a limb here,

27:53.922 --> 27:56.164
and guess that the reason
you can't focus on science

27:56.258 --> 27:59.717
is because you're so worried
about what's going on with Gypsy.

28:00.304 --> 28:01.636
I'm sorry,
I didn't hear anything you said.

28:01.722 --> 28:03.839
But I think I figured it out.

28:03.932 --> 28:06.595
I think I can't focus on anything

28:06.685 --> 28:08.176
'cause of this whole Gypsy situation.

28:08.270 --> 28:10.182
I think
I'm just gonna have to talk to her.

28:11.064 --> 28:12.475
What a great idea.

28:15.485 --> 28:16.475
Hey.

28:18.530 --> 28:19.520
What's up, Cisco?

28:19.865 --> 28:20.855
You're mad at me.

28:20.949 --> 28:23.282
- I said it was fine.
- No, no, no.

28:23.368 --> 28:26.827
Rule number one, when
a girl says it's fine, it's not fine.

28:26.914 --> 28:28.200
Amen!

28:31.460 --> 28:32.450
I'm gonna go.

28:34.755 --> 28:36.087
Rule number two,

28:36.173 --> 28:38.415
you don't blow off a date
with your favorite person.

28:39.218 --> 28:42.256
The day got away from me.
Let me make it up to you.

28:42.387 --> 28:45.551
Okay? Date night tomorrow?

28:45.641 --> 28:47.803
No, Cisco, it had to be today.

28:48.101 --> 28:50.309
- Why today?
- Because today is One-One-One Day.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.386
- One what... What?
- One-One-One Day.

28:52.522 --> 28:53.683
What is that?

28:53.774 --> 28:55.686
One-One-One Day on my Earth is...

28:57.027 --> 28:59.485
It's the day that you celebrate
with the one...

29:00.405 --> 29:01.816
With the one you love, all right?

29:01.907 --> 29:06.117
It's when one soul plus one soul
equals one soul.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.987
- That is so sappy.
- Yes.

29:09.122 --> 29:11.284
It is sappy and it's stupid
and schmoopy,

29:11.375 --> 29:13.583
but there is something about you that...

29:13.877 --> 29:16.870
It makes me want to do stupid,
schmoopy things.

29:17.422 --> 29:20.210
And I hate the word "schmoopy"
and people who use it.

29:20.300 --> 29:24.044
Well, that is the sweetest and
angriest thing you've ever said to me.

29:24.137 --> 29:25.423
Why didn't you just tell me that?

29:25.514 --> 29:27.176
Because I was embarrassed, Cisco!

29:28.517 --> 29:30.759
So, you know what?
Let's just forget about it.

29:30.852 --> 29:32.013
Because the day is already over,

29:32.104 --> 29:34.221
and I would really like to forget
that I ever brought this up.

29:34.314 --> 29:36.522
No, no, no, no.
I will not forget it, okay?

29:36.650 --> 29:38.107
You are important to me.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.985
And if One-One-One Day
is important to you...

29:42.948 --> 29:44.484
One-One-One.

29:45.826 --> 29:47.192
That's it.

29:48.578 --> 29:49.864
I gotta go.

29:51.373 --> 29:54.036
It's like he doesn't know
that he's a dead man.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.459
<i>Hey.</i>

29:57.004 --> 29:59.542
I don't know why I thought

29:59.631 --> 30:01.793
that we didn't have to talk
about what happened.

30:02.426 --> 30:04.258
You were so happy I was back.

30:04.594 --> 30:08.258
I am happy. You're everything to me.

30:11.351 --> 30:12.558
Look.

30:12.894 --> 30:15.261
I had to explain
to our friends and family

30:15.355 --> 30:18.393
why they had a save-the-date
for our wedding but no invitation.

30:20.193 --> 30:22.776
I had to constantly lie
about why you were gone.

30:25.574 --> 30:28.942
You don't know the looks people gave me
because they knew that wasn't the truth.

30:30.078 --> 30:31.660
You know,
what they must have thought about us,

30:31.747 --> 30:33.329
what it made me think about us.

30:33.457 --> 30:34.493
Iris...

30:37.878 --> 30:41.462
It's not like I wanted to leave you.

30:42.466 --> 30:46.210
I had to put on a brave face for
everyone, but it was killing me inside.

30:46.345 --> 30:49.179
And I think part of why
I didn't talk it through with you

30:49.264 --> 30:51.381
is I was afraid.

30:52.059 --> 30:55.348
I was afraid
that you would tell me to stay.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.682
And I wouldn't have been
strong enough not to.

30:58.273 --> 31:00.890
Barry, how do you know what
I'm gonna say if you don't ask me?

31:01.026 --> 31:04.645
I'm here to help you.
Especially when everything seems lost.

31:04.738 --> 31:06.274
But you have to let me.

31:06.948 --> 31:09.816
Sometimes, it's not about us.
Or the team.

31:09.910 --> 31:12.823
Sometimes, the weight of the whole city
falls on my shoulders,

31:12.913 --> 31:14.404
and it's up to me to carry it.

31:14.581 --> 31:16.573
I'm the Flash.

31:16.750 --> 31:18.286
See, that's what you don't get.

31:18.377 --> 31:21.961
When I put this ring on my finger,
it wasn't just about you or me anymore.

31:22.172 --> 31:23.754
It was about us.

31:23.882 --> 31:27.125
You are not the Flash, Barry. We are.

31:28.887 --> 31:31.425
<i>Guys, we need you.
It's about Deacon.</i>

31:33.600 --> 31:36.013
<i>I have something to confess.</i>

31:36.186 --> 31:38.348
<i>Kurt Weaver, Sheila Agnani and I,</i>

31:38.688 --> 31:41.681
<i>we stole the Kilgore malware program
from Ramsey Deacon.</i>

31:41.858 --> 31:43.065
<i>We sold it for billions.</i>

31:43.151 --> 31:44.437
<i>But it was all his idea.</i>

31:44.694 --> 31:46.686
<i>We got rich and he got nothing.</i>

31:47.155 --> 31:49.568
I guess that explains
why Deacon's got such a vendetta.

31:49.658 --> 31:51.945
Cisco, if he's live streaming,
can you track the signal?

31:52.077 --> 31:55.241
In, like, two seconds.
Papa loves having his own satellite.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.371
What are you going to do
when you find him?

31:57.457 --> 31:58.789
- Hit him with this.
- What is that?

31:58.875 --> 32:02.209
Deacon's powers are derived
from the binary code in his DNA.

32:02.295 --> 32:03.536
So, we created a compound

32:03.630 --> 32:06.247
encoded with a numerical string
pattern of ones and zeros

32:06.341 --> 32:08.503
to invert the order of the code.

32:08.635 --> 32:10.217
Ones become zeroes and vice versa.

32:10.387 --> 32:11.719
One plus one plus one.

32:11.847 --> 32:12.837
All right, we're on it.

32:12.931 --> 32:15.093
- Send us the location once you have it.
- Okay.

32:15.559 --> 32:16.549
Let's do it.

32:18.186 --> 32:19.176
<i>And now, you know the truth.</i>

32:19.896 --> 32:24.812
We stole Kilg%re from Ramsey Deacon.
He is the real victim.

32:25.902 --> 32:26.892
Good.

32:28.405 --> 32:30.237
- You forgot one thing.
- What?

32:31.116 --> 32:33.233
You didn't say goodbye to anyone
who's gonna miss you.

32:44.838 --> 32:46.545
You ever play wishbone, Tim?

32:53.180 --> 32:55.012
He and the others destroyed my life!

32:55.098 --> 32:56.964
Listen, I know you feel wronged, Deacon,

32:57.058 --> 32:59.300
but that doesn't give you a right
to take his life.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.679
I smell technology in your suit.

33:05.650 --> 33:06.982
What have you got in there?

33:07.736 --> 33:08.943
Oh, crap.

33:15.494 --> 33:16.735
I can't move.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.319
<i>Weapon system online.</i>

33:20.749 --> 33:22.160
<i>Targeting.</i>

33:22.792 --> 33:23.782
Run.

33:31.676 --> 33:33.212
Call me Kilg%re.

33:40.519 --> 33:41.851
<i>Barry, what's happening?</i>

33:41.937 --> 33:43.769
It's Deacon.
He's done something with my suit.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.471
<i>Remote access complete.</i>

33:45.649 --> 33:47.311
You put your voice in Barry's suit?

33:47.400 --> 33:49.983
Well, it had to be somebody,
and my voice is soothing.

33:50.070 --> 33:51.561
How much tech did you put in the suit?

33:52.030 --> 33:53.237
So much.

33:54.157 --> 33:56.649
I've actually always
been a huge Flash fan

33:56.743 --> 33:58.279
this past couple of years.

33:58.662 --> 34:01.279
But this is like having
a giant action figure.

34:05.460 --> 34:07.577
Frak me! He's locked me
out of my own programming!

34:07.712 --> 34:08.953
Do something!

34:09.339 --> 34:10.420
Barry, get away from him!

34:11.591 --> 34:14.083
It might lessen
his technopathic hold over you.

34:14.302 --> 34:15.292
I can't!

34:15.387 --> 34:16.628
<i>Who you talking to?</i>

34:17.013 --> 34:19.880
Someone listening in? Can't have that.

34:20.725 --> 34:21.715
Barry?

34:21.935 --> 34:23.597
Barry! His comms are offline.

34:24.853 --> 34:28.438
You have a defibrillator.
How about I stop your heart?

34:50.005 --> 34:50.995
Hello?

34:51.089 --> 34:52.795
<i>You have a collect call from...</i>

34:52.882 --> 34:55.590
<i>- Guys, help me!</i>
- We accept the charges!

34:55.760 --> 34:57.501
The suit's still freaking out!

34:57.596 --> 34:58.586
Well, get it off!

35:01.641 --> 35:02.973
Nope, I can't get it off!

35:03.143 --> 35:05.055
That would be the deadlock function.

35:05.145 --> 35:06.761
I built it in case
he ever got knocked out,

35:06.855 --> 35:08.312
so, a bad guy
wouldn't reveal his identity.

35:08.398 --> 35:09.889
It seemed like a smart idea at the time!

35:09.983 --> 35:11.940
<i>Flotation Mode activated.</i>

35:14.321 --> 35:15.482
What?

35:16.281 --> 35:18.147
What the hell
does he need a raft for, Cisco?

35:18.283 --> 35:20.866
He runs on water!
He might lose his speed out there.

35:20.952 --> 35:22.318
What's he going to do then?
He might drown.

35:22.412 --> 35:24.369
You couldn't just put
an oxygen tank in the suit?

35:24.539 --> 35:25.529
That's a good idea.

35:28.001 --> 35:29.913
How is this thing still intact?

35:30.879 --> 35:31.869
Cisco!

35:31.963 --> 35:33.670
<i>Babel Protocol activated.</i>

35:33.757 --> 35:36.124
What? What's the Babel Protocol?

35:37.510 --> 35:39.001
Why am I ticking?

35:39.137 --> 35:40.753
It's the self-destruct sequence.

35:40.972 --> 35:41.962
- What?
- Self-destruct?

35:42.057 --> 35:46.017
I'm sorry, have we not faced an evil
version of Barry before? My mistake!

35:46.227 --> 35:47.934
Well, how do I stop it?

35:48.897 --> 35:50.229
Hell, no.

35:57.238 --> 35:58.228
Oh, God.

35:58.490 --> 35:59.981
Cisco, there must be something
we can do.

36:00.075 --> 36:01.657
Not as long as this thing's
powered up.

36:05.580 --> 36:06.661
Come on, come on.

36:06.873 --> 36:08.455
Barry, can you hear me?

36:08.833 --> 36:12.543
Iris! Hey, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry.

36:12.754 --> 36:14.336
Just tell me what to do, and I'll do it.

36:14.631 --> 36:16.042
You need to throw a lightning bolt.

36:16.132 --> 36:17.122
At what?

36:17.801 --> 36:18.837
Yourself.

36:20.178 --> 36:21.339
You want him to do what?

36:21.638 --> 36:23.630
It might short the suit out,
give him back control.

36:23.807 --> 36:25.719
Or it might set off
the self-destruct early.

36:25.934 --> 36:27.425
Or it might stop his heart!

36:28.228 --> 36:31.392
Barry? Barry, you need to listen to me.

36:31.481 --> 36:33.143
Okay? We can do this.

36:34.484 --> 36:37.067
Okay. I trust you, Iris.

36:38.738 --> 36:40.730
Then run, Barry. Run.

37:12.272 --> 37:13.558
Barry?

37:19.738 --> 37:23.732
Oh, Tim, I know I have
the coolest superpower ever but...

37:25.201 --> 37:26.567
I'm kind of tired.

38:06.284 --> 38:07.274
<i>Hello, gorgeous.</i>

38:08.203 --> 38:12.072
Here, on Earth-1,
we celebrate One-One-One Day today.

38:12.248 --> 38:14.706
Even though I have zero idea
what that means.

38:14.793 --> 38:17.456
Or what any of
your Earth's holidays mean.

38:18.296 --> 38:19.958
I mean, I literally cannot believe

38:20.048 --> 38:23.462
you celebrate a day called
St. Shaquille O'Neal's Day.

38:23.635 --> 38:26.503
You guys have a magical elfling
in a red suit

38:26.596 --> 38:28.929
that breaks into your house
and eats your cookies.

38:29.015 --> 38:32.679
Actually, he's the boss of the elves,
so maybe do your research before.

38:34.145 --> 38:36.387
What I do know is
how special you are to me.

38:37.190 --> 38:40.183
And how sorry I am that I didn't
get to spend yesterday with you.

38:40.819 --> 38:43.937
Well, I guess you were busy
catching a deranged killer.

38:44.030 --> 38:47.114
Baby, we are always catching
a deranged killer around here.

38:47.367 --> 38:48.357
True.

38:50.829 --> 38:54.493
But I will always make it up to you.
I mean that.

38:54.791 --> 38:57.875
You just gotta let me know
when it's this important.

38:58.711 --> 38:59.827
I will.

39:01.256 --> 39:03.589
All right, then.
You ready to get your schmoopy on?

39:03.675 --> 39:06.042
'Cause, you know,
my schmoopy game is real strong.

39:14.269 --> 39:16.306
This is cruel and unusual.

39:17.522 --> 39:20.481
How will I survive in here
without my Kindle?

39:22.026 --> 39:25.019
You ain't touching anything
electronic ever again.

39:26.781 --> 39:28.773
There's three layers of
signal-dampening walls

39:28.867 --> 39:30.403
between you and the world.

39:30.535 --> 39:32.401
No wiring, not even a light bulb.

39:32.495 --> 39:34.111
There's technology everywhere
these days.

39:34.664 --> 39:36.747
That's fine.
We just have one question for you.

39:37.292 --> 39:39.830
The particle accelerator explosion
four years ago,

39:39.919 --> 39:42.036
you were living in Silicon Valley.

39:42.213 --> 39:45.047
So, if you weren't here that night,
how did you get your powers?

39:45.592 --> 39:46.582
Oh, wow.

39:46.718 --> 39:47.799
<i>You're not going to believe it.</i>

39:47.886 --> 39:49.093
It was really something, though.

39:49.554 --> 39:50.670
A real life-changer.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.755
And do you two
want to know the best part?

39:55.435 --> 39:57.597
I wasn't the only one.

39:59.314 --> 40:00.304
So, good luck, gentlemen.

40:01.232 --> 40:03.474
I think Central City
is about to have its hands full.

40:10.658 --> 40:12.866
Thank you for letting us
see the prisoner, Warden Wolfe.

40:12.994 --> 40:14.735
My pleasure.
Did you get what you needed?

40:14.829 --> 40:16.821
- We think so.
- Well, not to worry.

40:16.998 --> 40:18.830
This so-called Kilg%re
isn't going anywhere.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.249
We'll take good care of him.

40:25.173 --> 40:27.916
How is it possible that Deacon's a meta
if he didn't get his powers

40:28.009 --> 40:29.841
from Wells' particle accelerator
blowing up?

40:29.928 --> 40:32.716
However it happened, we will
figure it out, and we will be ready.

40:32.805 --> 40:35.013
After Cisco gets all that tech
out of your suit.

40:35.516 --> 40:37.599
You don't need fancy gadgets
to be the Flash.

40:37.685 --> 40:39.927
- You are the Flash.
- No. We are.

40:42.899 --> 40:44.231
Did I miss something?

41:05.505 --> 41:08.373
Ah, one of my childhood favorites.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.708
Schubert's unfinished eighth symphony.

41:11.219 --> 41:12.585
Unfinished until now.

41:12.804 --> 41:13.794
You didn't.

41:13.888 --> 41:17.177
It was surprisingly simple to
extrapolate the remaining movements

41:17.266 --> 41:20.009
once I familiarized myself
with the body of his work.

41:20.186 --> 41:22.098
<i>All 600 of his works?</i>

41:22.313 --> 41:23.975
I woke up early this morning.

41:31.072 --> 41:32.483
Do you have an update?

41:33.616 --> 41:35.357
Subject One has been located.

41:36.744 --> 41:37.734
<i>He's safe.</i>

41:38.454 --> 41:41.162
Locked up in the meta-human
wing of Iron Heights as we speak.

41:41.958 --> 41:43.574
He's right where you wanted him.

41:44.585 --> 41:45.746
What do we do now?

41:46.587 --> 41:49.421
Now, we find the others.
