WEBVTT

00:05.013 --> 00:05.995
- Max?
- No.

00:06.287 --> 00:08.087
Don't come over here with that
"I'm the boss,

00:08.200 --> 00:09.220
"you're the waitress" look.

00:09.229 --> 00:11.554
Cause I could just as easily give you
the "I'm the murderer,

00:11.668 --> 00:13.260
"you're the victim" look.

00:14.227 --> 00:15.974
The muscular woman at table two

00:15.976 --> 00:17.374
is sending her bagel back.

00:17.376 --> 00:19.232
She said she ordered
a plain one.

00:19.234 --> 00:21.484
I'm sorry, did you say
she wanted a multi-grain?

00:21.486 --> 00:22.185
No, plain.

00:22.298 --> 00:23.015
Whole grain?

00:23.128 --> 00:24.089
No, plain.

00:24.203 --> 00:25.761
Garlic?
No.

00:25.874 --> 00:27.578
The plain! The plain!

00:31.800 --> 00:33.090
It took me two years,

00:33.091 --> 00:35.530
but I finally got him
to say it.

00:37.184 --> 00:39.277
â™ª Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

00:56.247 --> 00:58.198
<i>Are you telling me</i>
<i>you don't hear that cat?</i>

00:58.820 --> 00:59.895
We have to let it in.

00:59.896 --> 01:01.641
It's clearly a stray,

01:01.642 --> 01:06.479
or this Marine I met last week
at a blood drive.

01:06.480 --> 01:09.132
Last week there was a man
outside our door screaming,

01:09.133 --> 01:10.543
"I've been stabbed,"

01:10.544 --> 01:13.331
and all you did was yell,
"Shut up."

01:16.187 --> 01:21.124
Because he said, "I think
I've been stabbed."

01:21.125 --> 01:23.844
You're either stabbed,
or you're not stabbed.

01:26.298 --> 01:28.782
Listen, it sounds like
the cat's saying hello.

01:32.915 --> 01:35.769
Hello, hello.

01:38.190 --> 01:39.633
Listen, it's talking.

01:39.634 --> 01:43.294
It's saying, "Help.
Can I come in?"

01:43.295 --> 01:44.609
Really?

01:44.610 --> 01:45.990
'Cause I think it's saying,

01:45.991 --> 01:49.057
"I'm fine.
Go back to sleep."

01:50.576 --> 01:52.395
Come on, it clearly just said,

01:52.396 --> 01:54.619
"Let me in.
Ignore the blonde.

01:54.620 --> 01:56.709
She's a bitch."

01:56.710 --> 01:58.597
Look, you can't just
let in everything

01:58.598 --> 02:00.485
that shows up at our door
and says hello.

02:00.486 --> 02:02.304
Yeah, I can.
I've done it.

02:02.305 --> 02:04.159
Max, we can't.

02:04.159 --> 02:05.911
We can't become cat ladies.

02:05.912 --> 02:08.035
And it always starts
out innocently,

02:08.036 --> 02:09.416
rescuing a stray,

02:09.417 --> 02:10.798
but then you have
to get another one

02:10.799 --> 02:11.944
so that they can
entertain each other

02:11.945 --> 02:13.225
while you're at work.

02:13.226 --> 02:14.405
And then somewhere
along the line,

02:14.406 --> 02:15.686
four more sneak in,
and you think,

02:15.687 --> 02:17.163
"We're good.
We're cool.

02:17.164 --> 02:18.773
We're the cute girls
with six cats."

02:18.774 --> 02:21.599
And then, one day, there
you are on <i>Animal Cops,</i>

02:21.600 --> 02:24.982
screaming,
"Don't take my babies!

02:24.983 --> 02:28.891
These 27 angels
is all I got!"

02:31.423 --> 02:32.768
That's how it goes, Max.

02:32.769 --> 02:35.691
Once you get one, you get 27.

02:35.692 --> 02:36.775
Not true.

02:36.776 --> 02:37.761
Really?

02:37.761 --> 02:38.745
How many garden gnomes

02:38.746 --> 02:40.618
do you have under your bed?

02:40.619 --> 02:42.951
27.

02:42.952 --> 02:44.496
What?

02:44.497 --> 02:45.480
They understand
I'm only keeping them there

02:45.481 --> 02:48.273
until I get a yard.

02:48.274 --> 02:50.408
Come on.
I want a kitty.

02:50.409 --> 02:52.313
Kitty for Max.
Kitty for Max.

02:52.314 --> 02:54.284
Max, we already have a horse.

02:54.285 --> 02:55.762
We can't afford another animal.

02:55.763 --> 02:56.848
We're broke.

02:56.849 --> 02:57.867
Come on.

02:57.868 --> 02:59.496
Chestnut needs a friend.

02:59.497 --> 03:01.533
He is dying to
trash us to someone,

03:01.534 --> 03:02.857
and all he's got is that rat

03:02.858 --> 03:05.573
who is super
self-involved.

03:05.574 --> 03:06.592
[Knock on door]

03:06.593 --> 03:07.609
Who the hell is that?

03:07.610 --> 03:08.663
It's so late.

03:08.664 --> 03:10.292
It's probably the cat,

03:10.293 --> 03:11.650
or the guy who's raping
girls in Brooklyn.

03:11.651 --> 03:15.113
Open the door,
and roll the dice.

03:15.114 --> 03:17.523
Oh, please.

03:21.224 --> 03:23.328
Please, somebody tell me

03:23.329 --> 03:27.402
they killed that damn cat.

03:27.403 --> 03:30.287
And where did it learn
how to say hello?

03:30.288 --> 03:31.645
Told you.

03:31.646 --> 03:34.361
It's been keeping
me up all night.

03:34.362 --> 03:36.975
This poor cat has been
crying at our door

03:36.976 --> 03:38.537
<i>every night trying to get in,</i>

03:38.538 --> 03:39.725
trying to get
a little warm milk,

03:39.726 --> 03:41.694
maybe a skosh of tuna.

03:41.695 --> 03:44.885
Max, that's our
dinner tomorrow.

03:44.886 --> 03:46.623
Wait.
Be careful.

03:46.624 --> 03:49.870
A cat is not always a cat.

03:49.871 --> 03:52.591
Oh, please continue.

03:52.592 --> 03:55.707
In Poland, we believe
if you die outside,

03:55.708 --> 03:59.707
you're reincarnated as a cat.

03:59.708 --> 04:01.315
Am I the only one
who thinks Poland

04:01.316 --> 04:03.905
sounds like a real freak show?

04:03.906 --> 04:05.478
So never let a cat in,

04:05.479 --> 04:06.462
because it's just a person

04:06.463 --> 04:08.430
that's been reincarnated

04:08.431 --> 04:11.840
and will bring in
all the bad jus.

04:13.580 --> 04:15.776
I think you mean juju.

04:15.777 --> 04:18.366
Oh, do I?

04:18.367 --> 04:20.563
Nighty-night.

04:22.368 --> 04:23.974
Look, we just have to put up
with it,

04:23.975 --> 04:26.072
and after a while,
it'll go away on its own.

04:26.073 --> 04:27.613
Go away on its own?

04:27.614 --> 04:29.974
It's a stray cat,
not my father.

04:29.975 --> 04:31.876
Good night, Max.

04:31.877 --> 04:33.745
Fine.
No kitty for Max.

04:33.746 --> 04:34.861
No kitty for Max.

04:37.779 --> 04:41.288
See, Max, I told you
the cat would stop.

04:41.289 --> 04:44.009
Max?

04:46.208 --> 04:47.452
Max.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.469
Can we keep it, ma?
Can we keep it?

04:54.648 --> 04:56.260
Earl, you don't want
a cat, do you?

04:56.261 --> 04:57.705
A cat?
God, no.

04:57.706 --> 05:00.866
Cats steal your weed.

05:00.867 --> 05:02.042
See, Caroline?

05:02.043 --> 05:03.656
Nobody wants the cat.

05:03.657 --> 05:05.337
We're keeping it,

05:05.338 --> 05:07.690
and I think we should start
celebrating right meow.

05:07.691 --> 05:10.144
Max, you didn't even try
to convince him.

05:10.145 --> 05:11.220
Come on, Earl.

05:11.221 --> 05:12.329
Don't you want a cat?

05:12.330 --> 05:14.749
Kitty for Earl.
Kitty for Earl.

05:14.750 --> 05:16.162
I'm too old to have a cat.

05:16.163 --> 05:17.876
I'm about six months away

05:17.877 --> 05:20.129
from crapping in a box myself.

05:23.491 --> 05:25.339
Oleg, how do you
feel about cats?

05:25.340 --> 05:30.113
Loved it.
Saw it nine times on Broadway.

05:30.114 --> 05:31.155
Very clever show,

05:31.156 --> 05:32.802
but a little expensive.

05:32.803 --> 05:36.332
The most I've ever paid
to see a pussy dance.

05:40.367 --> 05:43.761
So far we're keeping the cat.

05:43.762 --> 05:45.409
Hey, Han, do you want a cat?

05:45.410 --> 05:48.266
You could finally have
a friend your own size.

05:48.267 --> 05:50.619
Come on, you could
ride it to work.

05:50.620 --> 05:52.670
No, I can't have a cat.

05:52.671 --> 05:54.451
They're lazy, moody,
and judgmental.

05:54.452 --> 05:58.789
I don't need another you.

05:58.790 --> 06:00.907
Plus, they don't
show affection.

06:00.908 --> 06:02.618
Sure they do.

06:02.619 --> 06:04.329
You just have to know
how to get it out of them.

06:04.330 --> 06:06.566
Cats love to be lightly
spanked on their bottom.

06:06.567 --> 06:09.266
I don't understand why
a cat would like that.

06:09.267 --> 06:11.733
It's so mysterious.

06:11.734 --> 06:14.037
Kitty. Kitty.
Kitty-kitty-kitty.

06:14.038 --> 06:17.624
Kitty. Kitty.
Kitty-kitty-kitty.

06:17.625 --> 06:19.401
Hmm.

06:19.402 --> 06:20.323
Well, I can't have a cat.

06:20.324 --> 06:23.351
I work all the time.

06:23.352 --> 06:26.378
Why did I like that so much?

06:26.379 --> 06:27.727
I don't know.

06:27.728 --> 06:29.440
Something with boobs
was touching you.

06:29.441 --> 06:31.348
People with boobs touch me.

06:31.349 --> 06:33.158
She means aside from your mom.

06:33.159 --> 06:34.638
Then, no.

06:36.582 --> 06:38.688
Well, we've asked
everyone we know,

06:38.689 --> 06:40.529
and now I'm depressed,
because this

06:40.530 --> 06:42.504
is everyone we know.

06:42.505 --> 06:44.018
Let's start asking people
in the diner.

06:44.019 --> 06:45.565
We need to find it
a place to live.

06:45.566 --> 06:47.111
Why?

06:47.112 --> 06:48.428
Why can't it live
right here in my arm

06:48.429 --> 06:51.752
in between my hot and naturals?

06:51.753 --> 06:54.122
Kitty. Kitty.
Kitty-kitty-kitty.

06:54.123 --> 06:57.412
I have to admit, that
does feel kind of good.

06:57.413 --> 06:59.091
<i>Excuse me.</i>

06:59.092 --> 07:00.408
I overheard you two
asking people

07:00.409 --> 07:01.789
if they want a cat,

07:01.790 --> 07:04.883
and I'd really love one.

07:04.884 --> 07:06.495
Really?
Well, we have your cat.

07:06.496 --> 07:08.272
Whoa. Whoa.
Not so fast.

07:08.273 --> 07:09.457
I got a couple
of questions first.

07:09.458 --> 07:10.478
Do you smoke?

07:10.479 --> 07:11.465
Yes.

07:11.466 --> 07:12.531
- Drink?
- Yes.

07:12.642 --> 07:13.629
Prescription drugs.

07:13.630 --> 07:14.616
Occasionally.

07:15.593 --> 07:16.391
Forget the cat.

07:16.509 --> 07:17.842
Will you take me home?

07:26.362 --> 07:27.907
Kitty, you're gonna
love this lady.

07:27.908 --> 07:30.618
She smokes, drinks,
does prescription drugs,

07:30.737 --> 07:32.712
which we all know means Oxy.

07:32.713 --> 07:33.864
Hi.

07:33.865 --> 07:36.233
Oh, my God.
These she is.

07:36.234 --> 07:39.392
She's purr-fect.

07:39.393 --> 07:42.460
Come in.
Welcome home, you.

07:42.578 --> 07:43.802
See, Max?
It's great.

07:45.943 --> 07:48.443
What the hell is
going on in here?

07:49.005 --> 07:50.287
<i>Look at all these cats</i>

07:50.288 --> 07:51.274
<i>crammed in this little space.</i>

07:51.275 --> 07:52.756
It's so sad.

07:52.757 --> 07:54.401
The only thing missing
is Sarah McLachlan

07:54.402 --> 07:56.573
singing in the corner.

07:56.574 --> 07:57.561
What?
It's fine.

07:57.562 --> 07:58.581
There's not that many.

07:58.582 --> 08:01.213
They're attacking!

08:01.214 --> 08:03.944
Sorry.
He loves blondes.

08:03.945 --> 08:06.019
And apparently pooping
on the carpet.

08:06.020 --> 08:08.290
No, Twinkles, no.

08:08.291 --> 08:10.428
Oh, okay, quick introductions.

08:10.429 --> 08:12.403
That's Bethany,
Radford, Cellars,

08:12.404 --> 08:13.883
Franklin, Eleanor,

08:13.884 --> 08:15.629
Pudding, Mustachio,
Mitzi, Meredith,

08:15.630 --> 08:17.668
Baxter, Bernie.

08:17.669 --> 08:19.906
She remembers
all of their names?

08:19.907 --> 08:21.452
I don't even remember
the name of the guy

08:21.453 --> 08:22.868
I lost my virginity to.

08:22.869 --> 08:24.908
Best I can do
is "Coach" something.

08:24.909 --> 08:26.851
Well, Catherine,
I think it's lovely

08:26.852 --> 08:29.976
that you have such a big,
loving hairy family,

08:29.977 --> 08:32.938
kind of like the Kardashians.

08:32.938 --> 08:35.538
There's only 24.

08:36.559 --> 08:38.566
Oh.

08:38.567 --> 08:41.397
31.

08:41.398 --> 08:43.667
Let's go before one of
these rabid cats bites us

08:43.668 --> 08:45.773
and we become half-human,
half-cat hybrids

08:45.774 --> 08:48.373
who wander the streets
but are never cold.

08:48.374 --> 08:50.184
We're just gonna go have
a little conversation

08:50.185 --> 08:51.335
in the hall.

08:51.336 --> 08:52.816
And F.Y.I.,
the mother looks

08:52.817 --> 08:54.823
like she's eating
the little one.

08:54.824 --> 08:56.765
Just a thought.

08:56.766 --> 08:58.279
I'm only saying that
'cause it's in her mouth.

08:58.280 --> 09:00.978
Mitzi, release!

09:00.979 --> 09:01.965
Let's go!

09:01.966 --> 09:03.019
In less than five minutes,

09:03.020 --> 09:04.401
it went from 24 to 31,

09:04.402 --> 09:05.651
and I saw two cats
in the corner

09:05.652 --> 09:07.330
doing it doggie style,

09:07.331 --> 09:09.502
so in two months, we could
be looking at 50 cats.

09:09.503 --> 09:12.826
Max, you can't get pregnant
doggie style.

09:12.827 --> 09:14.636
Right?

09:18.849 --> 09:20.197
We can't go back in.

09:20.198 --> 09:21.514
There's so much hair in there,

09:21.515 --> 09:25.101
I saw a cat using
a lint roller.

09:25.102 --> 09:26.549
Okay, but if we don't
leave her here,

09:26.550 --> 09:27.865
we only have one other option.

09:27.866 --> 09:30.202
No, Kitty is not
going to a shelter.

09:30.203 --> 09:32.670
Why?
Lots of cats get adopted

09:32.671 --> 09:34.019
and end up in beautiful homes.

09:34.020 --> 09:36.159
Look, I didn't want
to say this,

09:36.160 --> 09:39.384
but she's not pretty enough.

09:39.385 --> 09:40.898
What are you talking about?

09:40.899 --> 09:43.826
She's not pretty enough.

09:43.827 --> 09:47.315
Come on, she doesn't have
classic good looks,

09:47.316 --> 09:49.520
but she's adorkable.

09:49.521 --> 09:50.902
We cannot take her
to a shelter.

09:50.903 --> 09:52.251
She'll die there.

09:52.252 --> 09:53.896
And, yeah, everyone
says they want one

09:53.897 --> 09:55.608
with a nice personality,

09:55.609 --> 09:57.583
but they really just want
a hot, sexy, young kitten

09:57.584 --> 09:59.689
who still gets excited
about balls in her face.

10:02.981 --> 10:04.790
Everything okay, ladies?

10:04.791 --> 10:07.192
No, everything
is far from okay.

10:07.193 --> 10:08.542
My boots are now UGGs,

10:08.543 --> 10:10.549
thanks to all
the cat hair in there.

10:10.550 --> 10:12.524
Ow!
Stop it!

10:12.525 --> 10:14.402
Sorry, that's Gina.

10:14.403 --> 10:16.415
She's bipolar, and she refuses
to take her meds.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.360
Ow! Ow!
Stop it, Gina!

10:18.361 --> 10:19.535
I'm sorry, Catherine.

10:19.536 --> 10:20.541
This isn't gonna work out.

10:20.542 --> 10:21.950
It's nothing personal.

10:21.951 --> 10:23.627
It's just that you're crazy.

10:23.628 --> 10:25.237
Truly, I'm heartbroken.

10:25.238 --> 10:26.746
Ow! Ow!

10:26.747 --> 10:28.491
I already have a name
picked out for her.

10:28.492 --> 10:29.665
Veronica Two.

10:29.666 --> 10:31.408
Ow! Stop it!

10:31.409 --> 10:32.951
Ow! Ow!

10:32.952 --> 10:34.159
I got to go!

10:34.160 --> 10:36.206
Who wants to eat?

10:37.381 --> 10:39.393
Um, just so we all know,

10:39.394 --> 10:42.982
Veronica One committed
suicide, right?

10:42.983 --> 10:45.733
Kitty, we're gonna
find you a nice home.

10:51.369 --> 10:54.822
Want a cat?

10:54.823 --> 10:58.244
Free cat?

10:58.245 --> 11:01.800
Want a cat?

11:01.801 --> 11:03.477
You are going to love it here.

11:03.478 --> 11:07.871
Park Slope is like the
Beverly Hills of Brooklyn.

11:07.872 --> 11:09.683
Here comes a good one.

11:09.684 --> 11:12.266
Hey.
Want a cat.

11:12.267 --> 11:13.339
Excuse me?

11:13.340 --> 11:16.056
Cat?

11:16.057 --> 11:18.639
Yeah, I'll take some crack.

11:18.640 --> 11:20.081
She said "cat."

11:20.082 --> 11:22.396
We're looking for
a nice home for a cat.

11:22.397 --> 11:23.503
Oh, so no crack.

11:23.504 --> 11:24.778
No.

11:24.779 --> 11:26.253
Well, why would I want a cat?

11:26.254 --> 11:27.696
I'm a crackhead.

11:30.950 --> 11:32.224
Well, Kitty,

11:32.225 --> 11:33.499
as hard as this is,

11:33.500 --> 11:34.706
I think it's time to let you

11:34.707 --> 11:36.249
back out there into the world.

11:36.250 --> 11:38.027
At least we leave you
in a rich neighborhood;

11:38.028 --> 11:39.772
you'll have a
better shot at life.

11:39.773 --> 11:41.617
Max, you are okay with this?

11:41.618 --> 11:43.193
Well, I was more okay

11:43.194 --> 11:45.675
when I did this with
my cousin's baby.

11:48.964 --> 11:51.043
There you go.

11:54.030 --> 11:56.174
Oh, yeah.
Move him to the next house.

11:56.175 --> 11:57.885
South-facing sun.
Pre-war building.

11:57.886 --> 11:59.126
She'll love it.

11:59.127 --> 12:02.480
There you go.

12:02.481 --> 12:04.057
You live in Park Slope now.

12:04.058 --> 12:05.557
You can adopt an African baby

12:05.558 --> 12:08.489
and wheel it around
in a $900 stroller.

12:08.490 --> 12:12.189
Can you believe
that was my plan "B"?

12:12.190 --> 12:14.154
Run!
Run away.

12:14.155 --> 12:16.421
Go.

12:16.422 --> 12:18.587
Ah, screw it.
She lives here now.

12:22.820 --> 12:23.819
Ooh. Look.

12:23.820 --> 12:25.086
They have a piano.

12:25.087 --> 12:26.884
You can make videos.

12:26.885 --> 12:30.484
You'll be a YouTube star.

12:30.485 --> 12:32.550
Bye, Kitty.

12:34.483 --> 12:37.015
Wow, I'm shocked
you didn't stop me.

12:37.016 --> 12:38.315
Stop you?

12:38.316 --> 12:39.681
If I had known that was option,

12:39.682 --> 12:41.214
I would have had you
stuff me in there.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.912
I wonder what Kitty's doing

12:46.913 --> 12:48.512
<i>in her fancy</i>
<i>town house right now.</i>

12:48.513 --> 12:50.844
She's probably snuggling
with an older gay guy

12:50.845 --> 12:51.977
who likes to read.

12:51.978 --> 12:53.310
You know, 'cause gay guys

12:53.311 --> 12:55.010
are the only ones
who still read.

12:55.011 --> 12:56.576
They're probably
on the couch right now

12:56.577 --> 12:59.675
with <i>A Tale of Two Kitties.</i>

12:59.676 --> 13:01.308
I'm proud of us.

13:01.309 --> 13:02.974
We selflessly gave
that cat a better life

13:02.975 --> 13:04.641
than we could ever
afford for ourselves.

13:04.642 --> 13:06.407
Oh, don't try to get in
on that.

13:06.408 --> 13:07.640
I did the right thing.

13:07.641 --> 13:09.039
You tried to leave her

13:09.041 --> 13:12.006
at that crazy lady's
pussy riot.

13:12.007 --> 13:13.838
Hi. Excuse me.

13:13.839 --> 13:15.638
Would it be okay if I put this
flier next to your window?

13:15.639 --> 13:17.738
No.
Sure.

13:17.739 --> 13:19.537
We lost our cat, Jinxy,
like, a week ago

13:19.538 --> 13:20.804
in this neighborhood.

13:20.805 --> 13:22.903
Have you seen her?

13:22.904 --> 13:24.335
No. No.

13:24.336 --> 13:25.668
I haven't seen a cat
in a long time.

13:25.669 --> 13:27.201
I was just saying
to her yesterday,

13:27.202 --> 13:29.967
"I haven't seen a cat
in a long time."

13:29.968 --> 13:33.132
Um, how come you didn't
have a collar on her?

13:33.133 --> 13:34.499
And where's her I.D. tag?

13:34.500 --> 13:36.632
Even my mother had
an I.D. tag on me.

13:36.633 --> 13:39.632
Well, it was
a flea collar, but...

13:39.633 --> 13:42.197
Why did it take you so long
to put the signs up?

13:42.198 --> 13:45.230
Um, what's happening?

13:45.231 --> 13:46.496
Um, here's what's happening:

13:46.497 --> 13:47.729
We are more than happy

13:47.730 --> 13:49.228
to put up this
flier of your cat,

13:49.229 --> 13:50.695
which we have never, ever seen.

13:50.696 --> 13:53.194
I mean, seriously, where
did all the cats go?

13:53.195 --> 13:54.893
Queens?
Staten Island?

13:54.894 --> 13:57.293
'Cause they're not
in this neighborhood.

13:57.294 --> 13:58.893
Okay.

13:58.894 --> 14:02.392
This was weird.

14:02.393 --> 14:05.024
Is there any way
this cat isn't Kitty?

14:05.025 --> 14:06.324
Nope, that's her.

14:06.325 --> 14:08.456
Same green eyes,
same notch in the ear.

14:08.457 --> 14:10.890
Hello.
Hello.

14:10.891 --> 14:13.622
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

14:13.623 --> 14:15.522
Hey, girls.
What's shaking?

14:15.523 --> 14:19.620
Not me, 'cause I'm all held in.

14:19.621 --> 14:20.987
Sorry, Sophie,
the cupcake window

14:20.988 --> 14:22.386
isn't open during the day.

14:22.387 --> 14:23.819
I don't need your life story.

14:23.820 --> 14:26.885
I just need a damn cupcake.

14:26.886 --> 14:28.317
Sophie, do you
remember that cat

14:28.318 --> 14:29.950
that was crying outside
our building?

14:29.951 --> 14:32.350
Yeah, you put it down?

14:32.351 --> 14:33.650
We thought it was a stray,

14:33.651 --> 14:34.883
so we tried to find
a home for it,

14:34.884 --> 14:36.182
but couldn't.

14:36.183 --> 14:38.115
So you put it down.

14:38.116 --> 14:39.515
No.

14:39.516 --> 14:41.547
We left it in a really
nice neighborhood.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.613
Oh, so a rich person
put it down?

14:44.614 --> 14:46.813
It turns out it
wasn't a stray at all.

14:46.814 --> 14:48.112
We just met its owner.

14:48.113 --> 14:50.378
This is the cat, Sophie.

14:50.379 --> 14:51.844
Her name's Jinxy.

14:51.845 --> 14:53.636
Oh, wait a minute.

14:53.637 --> 14:56.405
Wait a minute.

14:56.406 --> 14:58.033
You remember how I told you

14:58.034 --> 14:59.597
that if you die outside
in Poland,

14:59.598 --> 15:01.356
you come back as a cat?

15:01.357 --> 15:03.310
Yeah, that's kind of
hard to forget.

15:03.311 --> 15:07.121
That's not Jinxy.
That's my friend Nancy.

15:09.826 --> 15:10.802
Look at her.

15:10.803 --> 15:12.333
Same green eyes,

15:12.334 --> 15:13.734
same notch in the ear.

15:13.735 --> 15:15.851
Same whiskers.

15:15.852 --> 15:17.349
I don't think that
this is Nancy.

15:17.350 --> 15:18.522
Oh, yes.

15:18.523 --> 15:20.607
She and I got in a big fight

15:20.608 --> 15:23.115
and how she's come back
to haunt me.

15:23.116 --> 15:26.177
She died waiting for
an apology from me,

15:26.178 --> 15:27.969
and now she's back.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.923
Guess what.

15:29.924 --> 15:32.855
She's not gonna get it.

15:43.207 --> 15:46.217
Jinxy!
Jinxy!

15:46.334 --> 15:48.288
Jinxy, come on, girl.

15:48.289 --> 15:49.819
Look, I said on the phone,

15:49.820 --> 15:52.620
this area is where we
randomly spotted her.

15:52.621 --> 15:55.290
I wonder how Jinxy got
all the way to Park Slope.

15:55.291 --> 15:56.952
Just wait.
She's here, I promise.

15:56.953 --> 15:58.321
Jinxy!

15:58.322 --> 16:00.112
Jinxy!

16:00.113 --> 16:01.806
Nancy.

16:03.175 --> 16:04.901
Nancy!
Nancy!

16:04.902 --> 16:06.464
Nancy!
Nancy!

16:06.465 --> 16:08.842
Come on, Nancy!

16:08.843 --> 16:11.284
Nancy, it's Sophie!

16:11.285 --> 16:14.835
I'm here to apologize!

16:14.836 --> 16:17.181
Um, what's happening?

16:18.680 --> 16:20.210
Oh, my God.
It's Nancy.

16:20.211 --> 16:21.351
<i>I mean, Jinxy.</i>

16:21.352 --> 16:23.500
I mean, Kitty.

16:23.501 --> 16:25.259
Ooh...

16:25.260 --> 16:27.637
Hello.
Hello.

16:27.638 --> 16:29.861
Hi, baby.

16:29.862 --> 16:32.353
Kitty, kitty.
Kitty-kitty-kitty.

16:32.354 --> 16:33.581
What she's doing, they like it.

16:33.582 --> 16:35.408
I know, because I liked it.

16:35.409 --> 16:37.069
Anyway, we found your cat.

16:37.070 --> 16:38.563
Isn't that great?

16:38.564 --> 16:40.887
Actually, she's
my boyfriend's cat.

16:40.888 --> 16:42.415
I'm keeping her.

16:42.416 --> 16:44.309
Max, just close your
eyes and look away,

16:44.310 --> 16:45.901
like you do whenever
those people ask you

16:45.902 --> 16:47.861
if you have a minute
to save the earth.

16:51.150 --> 16:52.477
Just stick it in here.

16:52.478 --> 16:54.172
"Just stick it in here"?

16:54.173 --> 16:56.529
That's what I say when
my hand gets tired.

17:08.983 --> 17:11.839
Maxy. Maxy.

17:13.034 --> 17:14.827
Maxy, Maxy, Maxy.

17:27.845 --> 17:31.730
Now do me.

17:31.731 --> 17:33.856
First of all,

17:33.857 --> 17:37.608
I own the diner now.

17:37.609 --> 17:41.660
Secondly, don't ever
do that again.

17:41.660 --> 17:45.944
I guess I'll just
have to spank myself.

17:45.945 --> 17:48.367
No surprise there.

17:50.494 --> 17:51.955
I hope you're happy.

17:51.956 --> 17:53.781
I found Jinxy's owners
on Facebook.

17:53.782 --> 17:55.076
Not one pic of Kitty,

17:55.077 --> 17:56.239
not even a status update

17:56.240 --> 17:57.400
saying,
"We found our cat."

17:57.401 --> 17:58.763
But she is more than willing

17:58.764 --> 18:00.423
to talk about her
reverse French manicure

18:00.424 --> 18:02.017
and posts pictures of a meal

18:02.018 --> 18:04.275
I know she's gonna make
herself throw up later.

18:04.276 --> 18:05.836
Come on, Max.

18:05.837 --> 18:08.027
There's got to be
one photo of Kitty.

18:08.028 --> 18:09.090
Oh, wow.

18:09.091 --> 18:10.352
You found one?

18:10.353 --> 18:12.378
No, that manicure is heaven.

18:12.379 --> 18:14.005
Max, photos or not,

18:14.006 --> 18:15.566
we need to focus on the fact

18:15.567 --> 18:17.558
that the cat is back with
the guy who loves her.

18:17.559 --> 18:18.621
The guy who loves her?

18:18.622 --> 18:20.331
He doesn't love Kitty.

18:20.332 --> 18:21.806
If he did, why aren't
there any pictures of her

18:21.807 --> 18:23.248
at his first wedding?

18:23.249 --> 18:25.728
What, he couldn't spring
for a cat tuxedo?

18:25.729 --> 18:27.908
They're, like, 20 bucks.

18:27.909 --> 18:30.757
I know because I have one
on my garden gnome.

18:30.758 --> 18:32.567
This is not a loving home.

18:32.568 --> 18:33.908
Pics, or it didn't happen.

18:33.909 --> 18:35.551
Okay, Max.
Okay, just say it.

18:35.552 --> 18:37.127
I put the cat
in an abusive home.

18:37.128 --> 18:38.971
You put the cat
in an abusive home.

18:44.168 --> 18:46.615
I have a gift for you.

18:48.292 --> 18:50.705
No way!
No way!

18:50.706 --> 18:52.682
Oh, yeah, it's Jinxy.

18:52.683 --> 18:55.332
It's Nancy.
Jinxy was her slave name.

18:57.378 --> 18:59.958
Oh, Nancy, I missed you.

18:59.959 --> 19:02.070
I missed you so much.

19:02.071 --> 19:04.484
What did you do?
How did you get her?

19:04.485 --> 19:06.228
Well, it was
really complicated.

19:06.229 --> 19:07.769
I went to their apartment,
and I said,

19:07.770 --> 19:09.278
"You don't love that cat,"

19:09.279 --> 19:11.525
and they said,
"You're right. Take it."

19:13.135 --> 19:14.709
Oh, my God!

19:14.710 --> 19:18.062
Is this what happiness
feels like?

19:18.063 --> 19:20.309
So what made you
change your mind?

19:20.310 --> 19:23.023
Because two years ago
I was outside your door,

19:23.024 --> 19:27.515
saying,
"Hello. Hello."

19:27.516 --> 19:30.131
And you let me in,
and it changed my life.

19:30.132 --> 19:31.606
That's kind of different,
though,

19:31.607 --> 19:33.081
because I didn't want
to let you in,

19:33.082 --> 19:36.098
and I did want to let
the cat in.

19:36.099 --> 19:37.742
But you did let me in.

19:37.743 --> 19:39.351
You let me in,
and you gave me food

19:39.352 --> 19:40.960
and shelter and love.

19:40.961 --> 19:43.943
Not the way I wanted
to give to the cat.

19:43.944 --> 19:45.955
Max, are you trying
to equate a person's love

19:45.956 --> 19:46.961
with a cat's love?

19:46.962 --> 19:47.967
Not really.

19:47.968 --> 19:49.878
A cat's love is eternal.

19:49.879 --> 19:51.655
Hey, girls.

19:51.656 --> 19:54.002
I'm heading over to
the bodega salad bar.

19:54.003 --> 19:56.046
They just added hot ribs
and a sneeze guard.

19:56.047 --> 19:58.394
You need anything?

19:58.395 --> 20:00.304
Sophie, we got the cat back.

20:00.305 --> 20:02.785
She was in a house
where she wasn't wanted.

20:02.786 --> 20:04.059
Oh, yeah.

20:04.060 --> 20:06.842
That is so Nancy.

20:08.820 --> 20:11.099
Sophie, do you want
to see the cat?

20:11.100 --> 20:14.084
She's in the apartment?

20:16.867 --> 20:19.346
No, no, no.

20:19.347 --> 20:20.520
No, no.

20:20.521 --> 20:22.196
I can't see her right now!

20:22.197 --> 20:24.343
It's too much!

20:24.344 --> 20:26.723
I'm happy for you, Nancy!

20:26.724 --> 20:28.701
But I can't do this right now!

20:28.702 --> 20:30.109
[Screams]

20:36.581 --> 20:38.490
Wait, where did the cat go?

20:38.491 --> 20:40.267
Oh, no, Chestnut.

20:40.268 --> 20:41.776
<i>I left the back door open.</i>

20:45.733 --> 20:47.978
Oh, my God.
Look.

20:47.979 --> 20:49.855
She's on top of Chestnut.

20:49.856 --> 20:51.734
They like each other.

20:51.735 --> 20:52.739
Why wouldn't they?

20:52.740 --> 20:53.778
She's a foxy redhead,

20:53.779 --> 20:56.126
and he's a stud.

20:56.127 --> 20:57.802
You did the right thing.

20:57.803 --> 21:00.148
Kitty, kitty.
Kitty-kitty-kitty.

21:00.149 --> 21:02.394
Why do I like that so much?

21:02.395 --> 21:04.909
'Cause something with boobs
is touching you?

21:05.536 --> 21:10.425
