I don't want to step on your toes,

11:50.459 --> 11:53.504
or get near them, Lupita stinky feeta.

11:53.587 --> 11:54.588
[laughs]

11:54.672 --> 11:56.549
I forgot about that one.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.511
Whatever, Tito little pito.

12:09.061 --> 12:11.564
Lupita, that is just plain mean.

12:13.607 --> 12:15.317
[crickets chirping]

12:21.031 --> 12:21.907
[Schneider sighs]

12:23.033 --> 12:24.910
You think there's life on other planets?

12:25.828 --> 12:26.829
I hope so.

12:27.705 --> 12:30.624
I always thought I have
an alien-ish physique.

12:31.625 --> 12:34.503
Oh, you would crush it
on another planet, Doc.

12:38.215 --> 12:42.595
Man, before I got sober I never would have
been able to enjoy something like this.

12:42.678 --> 12:45.765
I always thought I needed drugs
to see the beauty in things.

12:45.848 --> 12:48.225
Well, I've just gotten into drugs myself,

12:49.268 --> 12:50.102
and, uh...

12:51.145 --> 12:52.772
I've been using these

12:53.189 --> 12:56.442
medical marijuana lozenges
to help me relax.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.736
They're called Lemon Dopes.

13:00.321 --> 13:02.156
That is one relaxed lemon.

13:03.741 --> 13:04.825
I'm sorry.

13:04.909 --> 13:06.494
Oh, no, no, no, it's fine.

13:06.577 --> 13:08.329
I can be around it. Doesn't bother me.

13:08.996 --> 13:09.830
Now.

13:10.748 --> 13:13.417
I just need them to help me sleep, yeah.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.711
I'm such an old-guy cliché.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.838
You know, with the tossing and the turning

13:17.922 --> 13:22.176
and the constant night terrors with
my ex-wife and daughters strangling me.

13:24.845 --> 13:26.847
Oh, my god, that sounds awful.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.850
Just my ex is strangling me.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.937
My daughters are filling
my pockets with rocks.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.106
I don't know much about dreams.

13:37.024 --> 13:38.901
Maybe it means something good.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.196
[sighs]

13:42.279 --> 13:44.698
Our minds are such mysteries.

13:46.617 --> 13:48.077
How long have you been sober?

13:48.786 --> 13:50.371
Almost eight years.

13:52.331 --> 13:53.165
Wow.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.252
That is really impressive.

13:56.335 --> 13:59.505
I can't even imagine
the strength that must have taken.

13:59.588 --> 14:00.422
Ah.

14:00.881 --> 14:02.466
I'm proud of you, Schneider.

14:06.053 --> 14:07.012
[whispers] You are?

14:09.557 --> 14:10.474
Absolutely.

14:12.768 --> 14:14.770
[exhales deeply]

14:16.814 --> 14:18.566
Do you know how long

14:18.649 --> 14:22.027
I've waited for any sort of
father figure to say that to me?

14:24.613 --> 14:26.824
You think of me as a father figure?

14:28.325 --> 14:29.451
Of course.

14:30.619 --> 14:32.121
You're my father,

14:32.204 --> 14:35.416
and Penelope is my much older sister.
I'm the miracle baby.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.295
I'm sorry I'm getting so emotional.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.839
My kids think of me as a failure figure.

14:43.173 --> 14:44.508
Well, not this kid.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.850
Ah, that ocean.

14:52.933 --> 14:54.935
Takes me back to Cuba.

14:55.603 --> 14:56.979
It was on a night like this,

14:58.355 --> 15:00.149
when I debuted as a dancer,

15:00.232 --> 15:02.943
and I wore my mami's heels.

15:03.027 --> 15:05.237
And my lean calves

15:05.321 --> 15:07.907
looked like they had been
chiseled out of marble.

15:10.034 --> 15:13.203
But when I stepped on
the dance floor I suddenly saw...

15:13.287 --> 15:17.291
[both imitate Lydia] My sister Maruchi
had also entered the competition.

15:22.296 --> 15:25.925
I am so happy that
I brought you into this world

15:26.008 --> 15:28.093
to laugh at me.

15:28.802 --> 15:31.639
Because of your giant heads,
I pee when I cough.

15:36.602 --> 15:37.561
Okay.

15:40.940 --> 15:44.193
I'm gonna go out on the deck
and take some photos for my Insta.

15:44.276 --> 15:45.736
Yeah, it's been ten minutes.

15:45.819 --> 15:47.863
People might start believing
you actually have a life.

15:47.947 --> 15:48.864
[coughs] Bite me.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.616
Hey, hey. Come on.

15:50.699 --> 15:51.825
Elena, go with your brother.

15:51.909 --> 15:54.036
Haven't I already thrown up enough today?

15:54.119 --> 15:56.997
No one is wandering around alone.

15:57.081 --> 15:58.207
We're on a boat.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.792
-Where could I go?
-Overboard?

16:00.751 --> 16:02.670
It happens all the time.

16:02.753 --> 16:05.005
Have you not seen that movie Overboard?

16:05.089 --> 16:08.008
Or that other movie,
the remake of Overboard?

16:10.052 --> 16:10.886
Well, I'm going.

16:15.015 --> 16:17.601
Remember Mami never let us go
to the freezer section

16:17.685 --> 16:18.894
of the supermarket alone

16:18.978 --> 16:21.188
because we might accidentally
get trapped in there?

16:21.271 --> 16:24.274
[imitates Lydia ] "In the freezer no one
can hear you scream."

16:24.358 --> 16:26.568
[both imitate]
"Everybody knows this."

16:27.903 --> 16:29.279
So did you freeze to death?

16:30.114 --> 16:30.948
You're welcome.

16:31.865 --> 16:33.909
-Heard you were here.
-Bruce.

16:35.077 --> 16:39.748
Tito was key in getting us that crucial
fifth anchor in Restaurant Boat Magazine,

16:39.832 --> 16:40.749
so, uh...

16:40.833 --> 16:42.584
consider all your wine on the house.

16:42.668 --> 16:45.671
Oh, in that case,
we'll have another bottle, or five.

16:46.463 --> 16:47.881
Just kidding, four will do.

16:49.008 --> 16:52.845
Well, we also have him to thank for
getting us up in time for Fouth of July.

16:53.637 --> 16:56.098
-It is great seeing you again, brother.
-[Tito] Same here.

16:57.349 --> 16:58.308
[clears throat]

16:58.767 --> 17:00.269
You were here for the Fourth?

17:02.396 --> 17:06.191
So you were a two-hour drive away when
Mami was in the hospital after her stroke.

17:08.235 --> 17:09.278
[Lydia murmurs]

17:12.156 --> 17:13.532
You were working,

17:14.575 --> 17:15.701
far away.

17:17.036 --> 17:17.870
Mami...

17:23.333 --> 17:25.377
Well, I'm sure you had your reasons.

17:26.128 --> 17:27.129
Permiso.

17:34.636 --> 17:35.596
What's up?

17:36.055 --> 17:38.057
El Capitan here.

17:38.849 --> 17:40.017
Living that yacht life.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.437
Right now I'm up on her stern.

17:44.605 --> 17:45.689
That means her butt.

17:47.941 --> 17:48.859
Peace.

17:49.568 --> 17:50.402
[chuckles]

17:50.486 --> 17:54.490
Nice, so just because a boat is something
someone can own, it has to be a woman.

17:54.573 --> 17:55.532
I'm sorry.

17:55.616 --> 17:58.077
I'll ask the boat what
its preferred pronoun is.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.162
God, you are so insensitive.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.331
Okay, I get it, you hate me.

18:03.165 --> 18:04.083
What?

18:04.708 --> 18:05.542
No, I don't.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.628
It just seems like
everything I say makes you mad.

18:07.711 --> 18:09.671
So? Everything everyone says
makes me mad.

18:12.216 --> 18:14.051
Well, it just makes me
not want to talk to you.

18:18.722 --> 18:21.141
Honestly, I didn't think
you listened to me.

18:21.225 --> 18:24.228
I mean, you're always on your phone
or with your stupid friends.

18:24.311 --> 18:25.229
Yeah.

18:25.312 --> 18:27.231
And you're always saying
that you hate my friends,

18:27.314 --> 18:29.066
and that I'm exactly like them, so...

18:29.149 --> 18:31.235
I told you, I don't hate you.

18:31.318 --> 18:33.112
I mean, sometimes I wanna kill you,

18:33.195 --> 18:35.405
but just like in the normal way.

18:38.617 --> 18:41.161
I only want to kill you
in the normal way too.

18:44.331 --> 18:46.708
But yeah, I'm glad you don't hate me.

18:47.543 --> 18:49.545
Of course I don't, stupid.

18:50.754 --> 18:54.299
I don't want us to end up like Tío
and Mami. I mean, they barely talk.

18:54.716 --> 18:55.968
That'll never be us.

18:56.051 --> 18:57.386
Have you met yourself?

18:57.469 --> 18:59.304
You like to talk... a lot.

19:00.931 --> 19:02.182
Besides, we need each other.

19:03.350 --> 19:04.726
Yeah, we do.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.396
[both]
To deal with Mom.

19:09.898 --> 19:11.483
Aww. We got that twin thing.

19:14.444 --> 19:15.904
Remember when we were little,

19:15.988 --> 19:19.199
Mami wouldn't let us go on the seesaw
'cause we weren't the same weight?

19:19.283 --> 19:21.952
"You're gonna launch your brother
into freaking space!"

19:24.621 --> 19:28.292
Plus, some day I want nieces and nephews
to throw cash at, like Tío Tito.

19:28.375 --> 19:29.960
I'm not having any kids.

19:30.544 --> 19:32.296
Then... your cats.

19:33.922 --> 19:35.424
That is such a stereotype.

19:36.508 --> 19:37.801
But yes, there will be cats.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.099
Hey, how about this?

19:44.933 --> 19:47.394
I will take a picture
of you for Instagram,

19:47.519 --> 19:49.605
if you stop talking about the boat's butt.

19:50.022 --> 19:50.856
Okay.

19:50.939 --> 19:54.526
And for every pic you take of me,
I'll quiz you on a vocabulary word.

19:54.610 --> 19:55.444
Deal.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.072
[camera clicks]

20:01.325 --> 20:02.618
Nice work.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.036
You really got my jawline.

20:07.372 --> 20:08.332
Narcissism.

20:08.790 --> 20:11.501
[laughs]

20:12.085 --> 20:13.003
Oh, come on.

20:13.086 --> 20:15.088
[laughs]

20:15.672 --> 20:17.007
You are unbelievable.

20:17.090 --> 20:18.842
Look, I didn't visit Mami at the hospital

20:18.926 --> 20:21.094
because I knew she wouldn't want me
to see her like that.

20:21.178 --> 20:23.138
-You know how she is.
-What's your point?

20:23.222 --> 20:25.390
She also would've preferred
to die on the floor

20:25.474 --> 20:27.726
rather than let EMTs
see her without lipstick.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.438
She needed you there,

20:32.022 --> 20:33.232
and you didn't show up.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.235
Just like when Papi died.

20:36.318 --> 20:37.945
What you talking about? I was there.

20:38.028 --> 20:39.571
-For the funeral, that's it.
-[scoffs]

20:39.655 --> 20:42.241
Who do you think had to make
all the arrangements?

20:42.324 --> 20:43.700
-Me.
-Yeah, I paid for everything.

20:43.784 --> 20:45.786
-I don't want your freaking money.
-Right. [chuckles]

20:45.869 --> 20:48.914
Papi was gone, Mami was in pieces,

20:48.997 --> 20:50.415
and you were nowhere to be found.

20:50.499 --> 20:53.710
I was wrecked after Papi died.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.212
We were all wrecked.

20:55.295 --> 20:57.005
But too freaking bad,

20:57.506 --> 20:59.466
because we are the grown-ups now.

20:59.549 --> 21:01.009
And we both have to step it up.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.761
You've always been the grown-up.

21:02.844 --> 21:04.513
Right? I mean, that's what you do.

21:04.596 --> 21:05.681
You're the superwoman.

21:06.431 --> 21:08.976
When Mami was in the hospital,

21:09.059 --> 21:11.061
I couldn't do it.

21:11.603 --> 21:12.437
Lupe, I...

21:15.524 --> 21:17.276
could not see Mami like that.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.991
Bad stuff is gonna happen, Tito.

21:25.158 --> 21:26.994
And next time we might not be so lucky.

21:27.452 --> 21:28.453
We might lose her.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.625
Am I gonna lose you, too?

21:38.922 --> 21:41.800
I know we have our things, but I miss you.

21:43.552 --> 21:44.386
Jerk.

21:45.554 --> 21:46.471
I miss you, too.

21:49.558 --> 21:50.684
-Jerk.
-[chuckles]

21:52.728 --> 21:53.562
And you know,

21:54.980 --> 21:56.815
good stuff is gonna happen too.

21:59.735 --> 22:01.570
And I really want you there for that.

22:05.115 --> 22:06.158
[sniffles]

22:07.826 --> 22:08.660
You're right.

22:11.788 --> 22:12.622
I'm sorry.

22:17.669 --> 22:19.755
I love you, Lupita.

22:22.049 --> 22:23.258
I love you too,

22:23.342 --> 22:24.551
Tito little pito.

22:29.264 --> 22:30.140
I love you...

22:30.223 --> 22:32.017
even if you are Mami's favorite.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.352
Ay. What?

22:33.810 --> 22:35.604
-What? Shut up! No.
-It's true.

22:35.687 --> 22:37.230
I know I get all the press,

22:37.314 --> 22:39.983
but, look, if this boat goes down,
you know who she's saving.

22:40.067 --> 22:40.942
-Alex.
-Yeah.

22:43.153 --> 22:43.987
But then you.

22:47.032 --> 22:49.576
-You know this viejita did this to us.
-[scoffs]

22:49.659 --> 22:51.411
I think she thinks you're perfect.

22:51.495 --> 22:52.913
You think she thinks I'm perfect.

22:52.996 --> 22:55.332
Really, I just think
she thinks she's perfect.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.251
She kinda is.

23:00.337 --> 23:01.630
Yeah, she kinda is.

23:02.631 --> 23:03.465
But crazy.

23:03.548 --> 23:04.549
Oh, off the rails.

23:04.633 --> 23:07.677
Se el tren hace rato.

23:09.846 --> 23:11.515
[laughs]

23:13.058 --> 23:14.184
Hey, uh...

23:14.643 --> 23:16.978
-Does she still talk to Papi?
-Oh, yeah.

23:17.729 --> 23:19.022
They never been stronger.

23:20.232 --> 23:21.316
They go on dates.

23:22.776 --> 23:23.860
Who pays?

23:25.278 --> 23:26.363
That's your question?

23:31.201 --> 23:32.953
[foghorn sounds]

23:33.036 --> 23:35.580
Hey, guys, check out these pictures
Alex took of me.

23:35.664 --> 23:39.167
He taught me how to "smeyes."
That means smile with my eyes.

23:39.960 --> 23:40.836
Oh?

23:44.047 --> 23:46.049
-I'm still working on it.
-Oh.

23:46.842 --> 23:48.969
I'm just glad you two are getting along.

23:49.052 --> 23:50.011
Yeah.

23:50.095 --> 23:52.764
Our consanguinity has never been
more indubitable.

23:53.432 --> 23:54.641
Say what?

23:59.438 --> 24:00.313
Oye.

24:04.109 --> 24:07.362
I'm sorry for not coming to see you
when you were sick.

24:07.446 --> 24:08.738
Oh...

24:09.948 --> 24:11.032
-It's okay.
-No.

24:11.533 --> 24:12.367
No, it isn't.

24:14.870 --> 24:17.205
It was selfish. It'll never happen again.

24:19.624 --> 24:22.127
I don't know
what I would do if I lost you.

24:22.210 --> 24:24.087
Ay, Papito.

24:24.629 --> 24:25.464
[sniffles]

24:26.214 --> 24:27.799
Te quiero tanto.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.011
Y yo te, Mami.

24:32.512 --> 24:33.430
[sniffles]

24:33.847 --> 24:34.681
Oye.

24:34.764 --> 24:35.640
[clears throat]

24:36.516 --> 24:37.350
Mirada...

24:38.518 --> 24:39.853
I'm gonna be around more.

24:39.936 --> 24:40.770
No.

24:40.854 --> 24:42.063
-Yes?
-Yeah.

24:42.564 --> 24:45.150
Pupita has really been
on my fotingo about it.

24:45.609 --> 24:47.152
[Lydia laughs]

24:47.235 --> 24:48.320
She's right.

24:49.154 --> 24:51.448
I guess, uh, we're both...

24:52.616 --> 24:53.783
pretty lucky to have her.

24:54.910 --> 24:58.497
Ay, Penelopita.

24:58.955 --> 25:01.082
Can you believe

25:01.166 --> 25:04.336
how selfless he is to compliment you?

25:06.922 --> 25:09.466
I did not think it was possible,

25:09.549 --> 25:11.551
but now you are even more perfect

25:11.635 --> 25:12.552
than ever.

25:15.931 --> 25:17.849
[Elena vomits like a foghorn]

25:24.981 --> 25:25.857
Me too, baby.

25:28.151 --> 25:30.153
