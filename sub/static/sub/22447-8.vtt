11:57.040 --> 11:59.040
(laughs)

11:59.040 --> 12:00.670
What does this
look like to you?

12:00.670 --> 12:02.960
Andi:
Come join us!

12:02.960 --> 12:04.830
-Go, Pops.
-Come on!

12:04.830 --> 12:06.250
You know you want to!

12:06.250 --> 12:09.080
Oh, I don't want to.
I have to!

12:09.080 --> 12:11.170
-Whoo!
-That's right, come on!

Breakfast is so much fun
when you stay over.

12:29.120 --> 12:31.250
-Frosted.
-Mm-hmm.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.500
But not too sweet.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.210
With a hint of peanut butter.

12:36.670 --> 12:38.210
-Nailed it!
-(chuckles)

12:38.210 --> 12:40.750
Guess who landed two tickets
to the Tape Tunnel?

12:40.750 --> 12:41.960
Me.

12:41.960 --> 12:45.380
-Take me!
-No, take me!

12:45.380 --> 12:46.540
What is it?

12:46.540 --> 12:48.920
It's the new exhibit
at the art museum.

12:48.920 --> 12:52.290
It's like a spiderweb,
but it's made out
of packing tape,

12:52.290 --> 12:54.170
and you can climb through it!

12:54.170 --> 12:56.000
Oh. It's okay,
you can take her.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.290
Okay, eat up.
Our entry time is 9:15.

12:58.290 --> 13:01.120
-This morning?
-What about school?

13:01.120 --> 13:02.710
Ah, you can be a little late.

13:02.710 --> 13:05.830
I'm skipping school
and this is your idea?

13:05.830 --> 13:07.580
It's only a few hours.

13:07.580 --> 13:10.120
I can call the school
and let 'em know you'll be
a little late.

13:10.120 --> 13:11.830
Okay! Come on!
We gotta go!

13:11.830 --> 13:13.460
I haven't finished
my cereal yet.

13:13.460 --> 13:16.040
Okay, we'll stop for a donut.

13:18.750 --> 13:21.290
"We'll stop for a donut"?

13:21.290 --> 13:24.290
Toto, we aren't
in Kansas anymore.

13:24.290 --> 13:26.460
Speaking of Toto,
can we get a dog?

13:26.460 --> 13:28.330
I haven't completely
lost my mind.

13:28.330 --> 13:30.120
(laughs)

13:35.290 --> 13:37.290
Two, three, four...

13:37.290 --> 13:39.380
Crud!

13:39.380 --> 13:42.000
Another day,
another soul-crushing
disappointment.

13:44.120 --> 13:45.170
Incoming.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.210
This is how it is, Buffy.

13:48.210 --> 13:50.580
You have to tutor me.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.000
I'm team captain.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.540
Sure, T.J.
Here's your first lesson:

13:54.540 --> 13:58.000
X times Y equals
ain't gonna happen.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.830
Well, if I'm not
on the team,

13:59.830 --> 14:02.170
then you "ain't gonna"
win another game.

14:02.170 --> 14:04.460
(scoffs) If you
don't pass me the ball,

14:04.460 --> 14:06.580
why should I help you
pass a class?

14:06.580 --> 14:07.710
Fine.

14:08.920 --> 14:10.120
I'll pass you the ball.

14:12.830 --> 14:14.960
Do we have a deal?

14:16.290 --> 14:17.330
No.

14:19.120 --> 14:22.830
You get my friend
Cyrus here, a chocolate
chocolate chip muffin...

14:22.830 --> 14:24.620
then we have a deal.

14:24.620 --> 14:26.580
You can't get your own muffin?

14:26.580 --> 14:29.210
I didn't need this extra level
of embarrassment.

14:30.250 --> 14:31.290
But no.

14:32.580 --> 14:36.460
Well, I can do it, but...
teach a man to fish?

14:39.120 --> 14:42.960
Walk to the muffin
like you already own it.

14:42.960 --> 14:44.080
He can't do that.

14:44.080 --> 14:46.170
Hey, don't tell him
what he can't do.

14:47.500 --> 14:50.120
Dancing with danger
is on my bucket list.

14:51.290 --> 14:52.290
Then what do I do?

14:52.290 --> 14:53.790
Take the muffin.

14:53.790 --> 14:55.210
That's it?

14:55.210 --> 14:57.580
Just don't let anybody
stand in your way.

15:04.460 --> 15:05.710
Mind if I, uh...

15:05.710 --> 15:07.620
(students protesting)

15:07.620 --> 15:08.790
-Hey.
-(protests stop)

15:10.330 --> 15:11.460
He's with me.

15:19.290 --> 15:21.830
You're gonna taste
so sweet.

15:24.920 --> 15:26.920
I'll need at least a C-plus.

15:33.580 --> 15:36.380
Why doesn't anyone
in this family answer
their phones?

15:36.380 --> 15:38.380
I'm sorry, I left mine upstairs.

15:38.380 --> 15:42.210
-What's wrong?
-I got a call from the school.
Andi never showed up.

15:42.210 --> 15:44.330
She was only
supposed to be
a little late.

15:44.330 --> 15:46.000
Why was she supposed
to be late?

15:46.000 --> 15:48.540
Your mom took her
to a tape tunnel.

15:48.540 --> 15:50.580
You can crawl through it.

15:50.580 --> 15:53.460
Uh, I-- I don't know,
it's a thing, uh...

15:53.460 --> 15:56.750
Well, it doesn't take
eight hours to crawl
through a tape tunnel.

15:56.750 --> 15:58.710
-(laughing)
-Right?

16:08.710 --> 16:10.330
Where were you?

16:10.330 --> 16:12.170
You had me worried sick!

16:13.420 --> 16:16.250
You know what's great
if you're feeling sick?

16:17.250 --> 16:19.250
Tea!

16:19.250 --> 16:21.750
They're not usable,
they're decorative only.

16:21.750 --> 16:23.580
-Not important right now.
-All right.

16:28.540 --> 16:30.120
Huh?

16:33.330 --> 16:35.750
You should've
called somebody.

16:35.750 --> 16:37.290
We were having fun.

16:37.290 --> 16:39.120
I lost track of time.

16:39.120 --> 16:40.380
Sound familiar?

16:40.380 --> 16:41.830
I was a kid
when I said that.

16:41.830 --> 16:44.380
You're supposedly
a responsible adult.

16:45.580 --> 16:47.670
This deal is a terrible idea.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.380
What deal?

16:50.380 --> 16:52.210
Uh, it wasn't really a deal.

16:52.210 --> 16:54.460
It was kind of a deal.

16:54.460 --> 16:57.790
Andi agreed to spend more time
here so you wouldn't have
to sell the house.

16:57.790 --> 17:00.120
Don't you think
you should've consulted me?

17:00.120 --> 17:01.540
Yes.

17:01.540 --> 17:04.330
I have an idea.

17:04.330 --> 17:08.170
You sell the house,
but not AndiShack.

17:08.170 --> 17:11.120
I'm confused but intrigued.

17:11.120 --> 17:12.460
Keep going.

17:12.460 --> 17:14.290
Take AndiShack with you.

17:14.290 --> 17:16.380
Move it to your new backyard.

17:16.380 --> 17:19.380
-Would that
even be possible?
-Sure!

17:19.380 --> 17:22.710
Celia, you're doin' it again.
Stop getting her hopes up.

17:22.710 --> 17:24.500
But it is possible!

17:24.500 --> 17:26.290
Not if we move to Paris.

17:26.290 --> 17:28.080
-Are you moving to Paris?
-Paris?

17:28.080 --> 17:29.880
No, it's just
a foolish dream,

17:29.880 --> 17:31.420
like sailing around the world.

17:31.420 --> 17:33.170
Us, can you imagine?

17:35.040 --> 17:36.960
I can.

17:36.960 --> 17:39.330
So we can live
our foolish dreams.

17:39.330 --> 17:41.500
If we sell the house.

17:43.120 --> 17:46.290
Then, I... I think you should.

17:47.290 --> 17:49.500
You guys both
really deserve it.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.420
Oh, Andi, you're not
standing in the way.

17:51.420 --> 17:53.040
We should go.

17:53.040 --> 17:55.420
I need to find out
what I missed at school today.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.250
You know what's weird?

18:12.250 --> 18:13.420
Tell me.

18:13.420 --> 18:15.830
At first, I didn't want them
to sell the house.

18:15.830 --> 18:19.210
But... now I don't care
as much about the house.

18:19.210 --> 18:22.210
I just really, really
don't want to lose them.

18:22.210 --> 18:25.620
Oh, Tin Man,
you had a heart all along.

18:25.620 --> 18:29.330
Stop. I'm...
I feel guilty.

18:29.330 --> 18:33.420
-About what?
-You thought CeCe
was manipulating me.

18:33.420 --> 18:35.080
But she wasn't.

18:36.080 --> 18:39.830
She tried really,
really hard, Bex.

18:39.830 --> 18:42.420
She bought cereal
that she hates

18:42.420 --> 18:44.460
and pretended to eat it.

18:44.460 --> 18:47.330
Then we had a dance party,
in my room.

18:47.330 --> 18:50.620
That sounds... awkward.

18:50.620 --> 18:54.000
No. She's a good dancer.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.790
I mean it.
She's changed.

18:56.790 --> 18:59.330
She's... fun now.

18:59.330 --> 19:01.960
She is?
Like how fun?

19:01.960 --> 19:04.080
On a scale of one to me?

19:05.290 --> 19:06.540
(knocking on door)

19:08.620 --> 19:10.750
Who is it?
Is it her?

19:18.040 --> 19:20.500
CeCe!
I'm so sorry!

19:20.500 --> 19:22.040
No, I'm sorry.

19:22.040 --> 19:23.500
You didn't do anything.

19:23.500 --> 19:25.210
Neither did you.

19:25.210 --> 19:27.210
I manipulated you.

19:27.210 --> 19:28.500
It didn't work, but--

19:28.500 --> 19:30.210
Actually, it did.

19:30.210 --> 19:31.880
We took the house
off the market.

19:34.420 --> 19:38.380
Wait. No. No.
You have to sell the house.

19:38.380 --> 19:39.670
Hey. Shh.

19:39.670 --> 19:42.380
It's just for now.
We need a plan.

19:42.380 --> 19:44.580
Your father wants
to live on a boat,
which-- no.

19:44.580 --> 19:47.710
-(laughs)
-Hey, congratulations.

19:47.710 --> 19:49.250
Your little scheme worked.

19:50.330 --> 19:51.920
You're the puppet master now.

19:51.920 --> 19:56.330
But I do still
want to hang out.
I mean, if you do.

19:56.330 --> 19:58.920
I'm on my way
to dance class
if you wanna join me.

19:58.920 --> 20:00.170
Yeah!
(laughs)

20:00.170 --> 20:02.880
-Go get dressed!
-Okay.

20:05.710 --> 20:09.710
-(clears throat)
-Oh! You're welcome
to join us.

20:09.710 --> 20:11.710
No, no, I couldn't.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.420
Impossible--
Well, if you insist.

20:13.420 --> 20:15.330
Go get dressed.

20:15.330 --> 20:18.420

Next, on Andi Mack...

23:12.880 --> 23:15.080
I saw you at The Spoon
with some person
I didn't know.

23:15.080 --> 23:16.170
You mean Natalie.

23:16.170 --> 23:17.920
She's just a friend.

23:17.920 --> 23:20.380
What is this?
When was this?
Where was this?

23:20.380 --> 23:21.920
Who's pool is that?

23:21.920 --> 23:24.830
When I was with Jonah,
he told me the exact
same thing.

23:24.830 --> 23:26.580
That you were just a friend.

23:26.580 --> 23:27.880
Hello. You're not Bowie.

23:27.880 --> 23:29.120
He's got a landscaping job.

23:29.120 --> 23:30.540
He asked me
to watch the shop.

23:30.540 --> 23:31.710
I heard you met Miranda.

23:31.710 --> 23:33.880
I think it was like
at first sight.

23:33.880 --> 23:34.710
She liked you, too.

23:34.710 --> 23:36.750
I was thinking
I'd like to ask him out.
