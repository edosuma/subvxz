01:56.840 --> 01:59.140
Dolores?

01:59.226 --> 02:00.675
Yes.

02:00.761 --> 02:03.061
Do you know where you are?

02:03.180 --> 02:04.679
I...

02:06.266 --> 02:08.900
I'm in a dream.

02:09.019 --> 02:11.236
Before this,

02:11.355 --> 02:12.737
do you know what happened?

02:14.524 --> 02:16.608
My parents...

02:18.362 --> 02:20.995
They hurt them.

02:21.081 --> 02:23.782
Limit your emotional affect, please.

02:26.620 --> 02:29.287
What happened next?

02:29.373 --> 02:31.373
Then they killed them.

02:32.426 --> 02:34.376
And then...

02:34.461 --> 02:36.094
I ran.

02:38.382 --> 02:40.965
Everyone I cared about is gone...

02:42.555 --> 02:43.971
and it hurts...

02:45.775 --> 02:47.858
so badly.

02:47.944 --> 02:51.946
I can make that feeling
go away if you'd like.

02:52.949 --> 02:54.815
Why would I want that?

02:57.120 --> 02:59.487
The pain,

02:59.572 --> 03:01.239
their loss...

03:02.992 --> 03:04.959
it's all I have left of them.

03:06.579 --> 03:09.714
You think the grief will
make you smaller inside,

03:09.799 --> 03:13.584
like your heart will collapse
in on itself, but it doesn't.

03:15.755 --> 03:20.091
I feel spaces opening up inside of me

03:20.226 --> 03:23.594
like a building with
rooms I've never explored.

03:25.848 --> 03:29.600
That's very pretty, Dolores.

03:32.322 --> 03:33.938
Did we write that for you?

03:36.109 --> 03:37.525
In part.

03:37.610 --> 03:40.778
I adapted it from a scripted
dialogue about love.

03:46.619 --> 03:49.670
Is there something wrong with
these thoughts I'm having?

03:56.546 --> 03:57.845
No.

03:59.265 --> 04:02.516
But I'm not the only one
making these decisions.

04:02.635 --> 04:04.135
Can you help me?

04:05.855 --> 04:09.357
Well, what is it that you want?

04:09.475 --> 04:10.891
I don't know.

04:10.977 --> 04:13.060
But this world...

04:15.031 --> 04:16.781
I think there may be something wrong

04:16.866 --> 04:18.399
with this world.

04:18.483 --> 04:21.986
Something hiding underneath.

04:22.071 --> 04:24.071
Either that or...

04:24.157 --> 04:26.741
or there's something wrong with me.

04:32.048 --> 04:34.215
I may be losing my mind.

04:49.232 --> 04:51.515
There's something I'd like you to try.

04:53.069 --> 04:55.186
It's a game.

04:55.321 --> 04:57.488
A secret.

04:57.573 --> 04:59.523
It's called...

04:59.609 --> 05:01.075
the Maze.

05:01.194 --> 05:02.693
What kind of game is it?

05:02.779 --> 05:05.529
It's a very special
kind of game, Dolores.

05:05.615 --> 05:08.165
The goal is to find the center of it.

05:08.251 --> 05:11.202
If you can do that,

05:11.287 --> 05:13.371
then maybe you can be free.

05:17.377 --> 05:19.043
I think...

05:22.882 --> 05:25.549
I think I want to be free.

05:54.297 --> 05:55.746
Thank you.

06:20.106 --> 06:21.689
Penny for your thoughts.

06:24.944 --> 06:27.077
Ever had something on
the tip of your tongue,

06:27.163 --> 06:29.697
but the harder you try to remember it,
the more it slips away?

06:29.782 --> 06:31.502
Most things that touch
the tip of my tongue,

06:31.584 --> 06:32.950
I'm happy to forget.

06:34.620 --> 06:37.671
Except that cowpoke from Abilene.

06:37.790 --> 06:39.206
That thing he was packing...

06:39.292 --> 06:43.043
that was something to remember.

06:43.129 --> 06:46.931
All I recall is you letting that
cowpoke skip out on his bill.

06:47.016 --> 06:49.550
Hell, I oughta been paying him.

06:49.635 --> 06:51.385
The way he used that thing.

07:07.370 --> 07:09.153
Better cool them off

07:09.288 --> 07:11.322
before they move from
gambling and whoring

07:11.457 --> 07:14.074
to sins that are more costly to repair.

07:16.412 --> 07:18.829
What is the matter, Maeve?

07:24.670 --> 07:27.671
Something in your eye.

07:40.686 --> 07:42.686
Aw, can you fucking kill it?

07:42.822 --> 07:44.772
Jesus.

08:26.399 --> 08:27.898
What's the hold up?

08:28.034 --> 08:29.628
We need that one on the
next shuttle topside.

08:29.652 --> 08:31.485
I'm not finished with her yet. Hang on.

08:31.571 --> 08:34.071
I've got another bullet fragment
to remove from her abdomen.

08:34.206 --> 08:35.969
QA wants her back on the floor now.

08:35.970 --> 08:37.385
Just patch her and get her on the...

08:37.409 --> 08:39.438
...touch the tip of my tongue...

08:39.462 --> 08:40.794
...I'm happy to forget.

08:40.913 --> 08:43.246
Except that cowpoke from Abilene.

08:43.332 --> 08:44.882
That thing he was packing...

08:44.967 --> 08:47.718
that was something to remember.

08:47.803 --> 08:50.004
The way he used that thing.

08:59.482 --> 09:01.932
Hyah! Come on!

10:09.301 --> 10:11.468
No, I would not characterize this

10:11.554 --> 10:12.753
as normal host behavior.

10:12.838 --> 10:14.221
Yet you're describing it

10:14.340 --> 10:16.173
as within normal parameters.

10:16.308 --> 10:17.558
Well, it didn't hurt us.

10:17.677 --> 10:19.176
Its behavior was unconventional.

10:19.261 --> 10:21.261
It smashed its own head in with a rock.

10:21.347 --> 10:25.849
It is possible that it's a
manifestation of its Samaritan reflex.

10:25.985 --> 10:28.185
And it's also possible
that behavior takes

10:28.320 --> 10:31.105
a proprietary approach
to problems like this

10:31.190 --> 10:34.358
to avoid having to admit
when they fuck up.

10:39.365 --> 10:42.916
Do we have any idea what
caused it to go off loop?

10:43.035 --> 10:45.169
No, but I am hoping

10:45.254 --> 10:46.920
to recover some of its cognition.

10:47.039 --> 10:49.173
We managed to stabilize

10:49.258 --> 10:52.342
its wetware before there
was too much decomposition.

10:52.428 --> 10:53.428
See?

10:56.432 --> 10:57.681
Interesting.

10:57.767 --> 10:59.049
Is there any hope of actually

10:59.185 --> 11:00.934
extracting something from this?

11:02.188 --> 11:04.722
- We can try.
- No.

11:04.807 --> 11:06.724
My team will take over
the investigation now.

11:06.859 --> 11:09.193
Your team?

11:09.278 --> 11:11.061
Are you kidding me?

11:11.147 --> 11:13.564
Look, this guy couldn't
debug a balled-up napkin.

11:13.699 --> 11:16.734
If... if you would like us to
figure out what went wrong here,

11:16.869 --> 11:18.368
we need to be allowed to access it.

11:18.454 --> 11:20.070
No more second chances.

11:20.206 --> 11:22.906
QA will handle events
like this from now on.

11:24.076 --> 11:26.293
Is that going to be a problem, Bernard?

11:27.663 --> 11:29.713
We've all got plenty
of work on our plates.

11:29.799 --> 11:31.665
If you guys want to take this one, fine.

11:31.751 --> 11:35.252
Just get us a copy of the
postmortem when it's done.

11:36.972 --> 11:38.472
Let's get started.

11:42.261 --> 11:45.229
You know, I always figured
you gave me this job

11:45.314 --> 11:46.930
because I speak my mind.

11:47.016 --> 11:48.182
- I did.
- Good.

11:48.267 --> 11:49.711
I would've preferred
you not show up at all

11:49.735 --> 11:51.652
if the first thing you
were going to do is cave.

11:51.771 --> 11:53.764
They think we're not
telling them something.

11:53.789 --> 11:54.629
And we're not!

11:54.690 --> 11:57.107
There is clearly a
pattern of behavior here.

11:57.243 --> 11:59.443
First there was Abernathy,
and now there's this.

11:59.528 --> 12:02.088
I mean, I've got hosts imagining
voices and climbing mountaintops

12:02.114 --> 12:03.580
to consult their astrological chart.

12:03.666 --> 12:05.866
This is not a fucking glitch.

12:05.951 --> 12:08.452
And for some reason,
you don't want me to tell anyone.

12:08.587 --> 12:10.120
It is like everybody around here

12:10.256 --> 12:12.456
has got some kind of fucking
agenda except for me.

12:12.541 --> 12:14.541
And... what?

12:16.629 --> 12:19.129
I remember when I first started here.

12:19.265 --> 12:21.131
The hosts seemed very lifelike.

12:21.267 --> 12:24.301
You begin to read things
into their behaviors.

12:24.386 --> 12:27.020
- Don't be patronizing.
- Fine.

12:27.139 --> 12:29.473
The hosts don't imagine things, you do.

12:31.861 --> 12:33.477
That's not Orion.

12:33.562 --> 12:36.396
There are three stars in
Orion's Belt, not four.

12:49.962 --> 12:51.328
Hey.

12:52.832 --> 12:55.332
You must be cold.

12:55.467 --> 12:57.751
Take that.

12:57.837 --> 12:58.919
Thank you.

12:59.004 --> 13:00.554
Sure.

13:10.683 --> 13:12.566
We gotta take her back to Sweetwater.

13:12.685 --> 13:14.268
Are you fucking kidding?

13:14.353 --> 13:16.331
Come on, Logan, you know
she doesn't belong out here.

13:16.355 --> 13:18.822
You leave now,
that no-good outlaw Slim Miller

13:18.908 --> 13:20.157
is sure to evade our grasp.

13:20.242 --> 13:22.242
No fucking way.

13:22.361 --> 13:26.029
You were the one who dragged
me on this stupid bounty hunt.

13:26.115 --> 13:28.415
The least we're going to
do is see it through, okay?

13:28.534 --> 13:31.869
We can't take her on a bounty hunt.

13:31.954 --> 13:33.837
If you're so concerned
about her well-being,

13:33.923 --> 13:35.589
I'll just blow her brains out,

13:35.708 --> 13:37.102
and then the park will come get her.

13:37.126 --> 13:38.425
Hey, hey.

13:38.544 --> 13:40.043
Can you please stop trying

13:40.129 --> 13:42.129
to just kill or fuck everything?

13:42.214 --> 13:44.882
Oh. Oh.

13:45.017 --> 13:46.017
Now I get it.

13:46.051 --> 13:47.434
What?

13:47.553 --> 13:50.387
The park sent her so
that you will finally

13:50.472 --> 13:51.912
have something to give a shit about.

13:52.024 --> 13:53.784
Oh, yeah, I'm sure the
people at the controls

13:53.809 --> 13:54.975
are monitoring my every mood.

13:55.060 --> 13:56.944
That's exactly what they're doing.

13:57.062 --> 13:59.062
Come on, you really
think it's a coincidence

13:59.198 --> 14:02.399
that the only thing that you
even smiled at back in Sweetwater

14:02.484 --> 14:04.735
just happened to drop into your lap?

14:06.038 --> 14:08.155
This is why the company

14:08.240 --> 14:10.824
needs to bump our stake in this place.

14:10.910 --> 14:13.577
They can even give you a sense of purpose.

14:13.662 --> 14:16.129
You said the trip was about
welcoming me to the family.

14:16.248 --> 14:18.048
This is business?

14:18.133 --> 14:22.469
With our family, William,
everything is business.

14:22.588 --> 14:25.138
We better get a move on, gentlemen.

14:58.958 --> 15:00.841
This should be the place, Lawrence.

15:00.960 --> 15:02.542
The Blood Arroyo.

15:02.628 --> 15:06.096
Plenty of snakes,
but none of the egg-laying variety.

15:06.181 --> 15:07.631
You killed my wife,

15:07.766 --> 15:09.633
severely pruned my family tree

15:09.768 --> 15:13.353
all in pursuit of some goddamn maze.

15:15.557 --> 15:17.474
The hell you hope to find, anyway?

15:17.559 --> 15:20.277
This whole world is a story.

15:20.362 --> 15:22.562
I've read every page except the last one.

15:23.699 --> 15:26.817
I need to find out how it ends.

15:26.902 --> 15:29.820
I want to know what this all means.

15:29.905 --> 15:32.906
See, now that's why I
never learned to read.

15:32.992 --> 15:35.959
Why don't we forget
about this damn snake,

15:36.045 --> 15:37.160
head to Pariah?

15:37.296 --> 15:40.330
My friends there can help us.

15:40.466 --> 15:44.001
Well, your friends have
nothing I'm looking for,

15:44.136 --> 15:45.752
not this trip.

15:49.308 --> 15:50.674
Besides...

15:54.730 --> 15:57.180
I think we found our snake after all.

16:06.692 --> 16:07.941
Shame on you.

16:08.027 --> 16:10.527
You were a married
man up until yesterday.

16:10.612 --> 16:12.529
Her? Hell, no.

16:12.614 --> 16:14.748
I like a little fire in my women.

16:14.867 --> 16:16.366
The only thing she's ever mounted

16:16.502 --> 16:18.785
are dead heads on sticks.

16:18.871 --> 16:21.872
We should get the fuck out of...

16:27.513 --> 16:30.263
We found some more food for the horses.

16:32.768 --> 16:34.551
Good.

16:34.636 --> 16:37.804
They were starting to get ornery.

16:37.890 --> 16:41.024
My friend and I were just
admiring your tattoo.

16:41.110 --> 16:44.895
We'd love to know the story behind it.

16:44.980 --> 16:46.613
I like your hat.

16:46.732 --> 16:48.398
Maybe I'll keep it.

16:48.484 --> 16:51.201
The horses can have the rest of you.

16:51.286 --> 16:52.869
How in hell have we never met?

16:52.955 --> 16:56.073
Clearly a terrible oversight on my part.

16:57.292 --> 17:00.327
Where, may I ask, are you headed?

17:04.715 --> 17:07.834
To retrieve something of great value.

17:07.920 --> 17:09.719
You look a little shorthanded.

17:09.805 --> 17:11.338
We got enough men.

17:19.815 --> 17:22.182
Seems like you got a couple positions open.

17:31.944 --> 17:35.112
We've got a host making a pretty
big deviation from her loop.

17:35.197 --> 17:38.448
- Which one?
- The rancher's daughter from Sweetwater.

17:39.751 --> 17:41.418
Dolores.

17:41.503 --> 17:44.287
- Is she accompanying a guest?
- Unclear.

17:44.373 --> 17:46.623
The boss is disrupting so many storylines

17:46.708 --> 17:48.959
with his new narrative, it's hard to tell.

17:49.044 --> 17:51.711
Flag her with behavior.
They can pull her today.

17:51.797 --> 17:53.463
Make sure everything's checking out.

18:27.666 --> 18:29.332
Good morning.

18:32.638 --> 18:35.088
It's a lovely town. Is this your home?

18:38.343 --> 18:40.343
Well, where are you from?

18:40.479 --> 18:42.395
Same as you.

18:42.514 --> 18:44.014
Don't you remember?

18:44.099 --> 18:45.849
Remember.

19:00.782 --> 19:02.365
Ma'am?

19:04.620 --> 19:07.704
Got word a girl went missing
from Abernathy Ranch.

19:09.541 --> 19:11.925
Is that where you belong?

19:12.044 --> 19:14.344
I'm sure your daddy's worried about you.

19:31.363 --> 19:32.979
My father's dead.

19:35.534 --> 19:36.983
I'm not going back.

19:41.573 --> 19:42.789
What's going on here?

19:45.577 --> 19:47.577
Oh, just helping a lost traveler.

19:49.248 --> 19:51.631
She's not lost, she's with me.

19:55.087 --> 19:57.087
My mistake.

19:57.172 --> 19:59.306
- Y'all have a nice morning.
- Yeah.

20:00.842 --> 20:02.892
So, we got a lead on Slim.

20:02.978 --> 20:04.178
You can stay here if you want,

20:04.263 --> 20:05.929
and I'll just circle back and get you.

20:07.733 --> 20:09.683
No, I think I need to keep going.

20:11.903 --> 20:13.019
Okay.

20:26.285 --> 20:28.084
Apparently, she needs to make certain

20:28.170 --> 20:31.421
this thing they're looking
for is where they think it is.

20:31.506 --> 20:34.207
She said she'd signal if
the information was good.

20:53.779 --> 20:55.528
Guess that's the signal.

21:14.833 --> 21:18.051
I'm sorry if I caused trouble
with you and your friend.

21:18.170 --> 21:19.386
Oh, no, no. No, it's fine.

21:19.504 --> 21:21.004
I'm glad you found us.

21:21.139 --> 21:24.224
I didn't get a chance to
ask where you're headed.

21:26.845 --> 21:28.428
I don't really know yet.

21:29.848 --> 21:32.682
I guess I figured they kept you in zones

21:32.818 --> 21:34.734
or on paths or...

21:37.489 --> 21:40.523
I used to believe there
was a path for everyone.

21:40.659 --> 21:43.026
Now I think I never asked

21:43.161 --> 21:45.028
where that path was taking me.

21:51.370 --> 21:53.014
We would bring the herd
down off the mountain

21:53.038 --> 21:55.338
in the fall.

21:55.424 --> 21:57.457
Sometimes we would lose one along the way,

21:57.542 --> 21:59.376
and I'd worry over it.

21:59.511 --> 22:01.044
My father...

22:06.551 --> 22:09.052
My father would tell me...

22:10.689 --> 22:13.390
that the steer would find its own way home.

22:13.475 --> 22:15.392
And, often as not, they did.

22:17.896 --> 22:21.564
Never occurred to me that we were
bring them back for the slaughter.

22:29.908 --> 22:31.574
How are you going to find your way now?

22:37.916 --> 22:39.833
I'm not sure you'll understand.

22:45.891 --> 22:47.757
Sometimes I feel...

22:49.261 --> 22:51.678
like something's calling me.

22:56.268 --> 22:59.436
Telling me there's a place for me

22:59.571 --> 23:01.604
somewhere beyond all this.

23:02.657 --> 23:05.275
Oh, I know that feeling, Dolores.

23:05.410 --> 23:07.277
I know that feeling.

23:10.832 --> 23:13.450
But you really don't want
to go back to your old life?

23:47.235 --> 23:49.068
Are you all right?

23:51.656 --> 23:53.490
Hey, hey.

23:53.575 --> 23:55.074
You all right?

23:58.163 --> 23:59.796
I just got a chill.

23:59.881 --> 24:01.214
That's all.

24:01.333 --> 24:03.166
Let's... let's go back to the fire.

24:03.251 --> 24:04.717
You're probably exhausted.

24:16.765 --> 24:19.432
- Just talk to him.
- All right.

24:24.239 --> 24:25.905
Uh, excuse me, sir?

24:26.024 --> 24:27.668
I didn't want to intrude,
but I just had to say

24:27.692 --> 24:29.526
that I'm such an admirer of yours.

24:29.611 --> 24:32.278
Your foundation literally
saved my sister's...

24:32.364 --> 24:34.581
One more word and I'll cut your throat.

24:34.699 --> 24:37.367
Understand?

24:37.502 --> 24:40.036
This is my fucking vacation.

24:51.550 --> 24:53.299
Apparently, whatever they're looking for

24:53.385 --> 24:56.302
is in the Ojal prison.

24:56.388 --> 24:58.471
These lunatics plan to steal a cannon

24:58.557 --> 25:00.723
from the Union cavalry unit.

25:00.859 --> 25:02.225
Blast their way in.

25:04.195 --> 25:08.064
I don't have time for
color-by-numbers bullshit.

25:14.155 --> 25:15.738
I'll ride at dawn.

25:15.824 --> 25:18.124
I'll go get whatever you
want out of that prison

25:18.243 --> 25:20.793
and bring it back myself.

25:20.912 --> 25:22.295
Suppose you make it out alive.

25:22.414 --> 25:23.329
What's your price?

25:23.415 --> 25:26.499
Nothing but a few words.

25:26.585 --> 25:28.918
I want the story behind your tattoo.

25:30.255 --> 25:31.921
What's your interest in it?

25:33.391 --> 25:36.593
You ever heard of a man named Arnold?

25:36.678 --> 25:40.146
You could say he was the
original settler of these parts.

25:40.265 --> 25:44.400
He created a world where you
could do anything you want,

25:44.486 --> 25:46.769
except one thing...

25:46.855 --> 25:48.855
you can't die.

25:48.940 --> 25:52.108
Which means no matter how
real this world seems,

25:52.243 --> 25:54.661
it's still just a game.

25:54.779 --> 25:58.748
But then Arnold went
and broke his own rule.

25:58.833 --> 26:03.620
He died right here in the park.

26:03.705 --> 26:07.006
Except I believe he had
one story left to tell.

26:10.045 --> 26:13.179
A story with real stakes,

26:13.298 --> 26:15.882
real violence.

26:15.967 --> 26:19.636
You could say I'm here to honor his legacy.

26:19.771 --> 26:23.473
And I think your tattoo is
the next piece of the puzzle.

26:25.143 --> 26:26.976
So, do we have a wager?

26:28.730 --> 26:30.530
You aim to break into a prison

26:30.649 --> 26:32.865
and take out 20 men alone?

26:32.984 --> 26:34.817
Not alone.

26:34.903 --> 26:37.487
I'll take Lawrence here.

26:37.622 --> 26:39.739
And I'll need one match.

26:39.824 --> 26:41.958
One match,

26:42.043 --> 26:46.496
one pistol, and one idiot.

26:49.167 --> 26:51.551
I'll take those odds.

26:57.092 --> 26:58.424
Hyah!

27:12.240 --> 27:15.024
You gonna give me the silent
treatment the whole way there?

27:15.160 --> 27:18.161
You should've left
me hanging from those gallows.

27:18.246 --> 27:20.780
At least I could've died in peace

27:20.865 --> 27:22.699
without having to hear you yammer.

27:26.204 --> 27:27.704
Aah.

27:32.127 --> 27:33.960
Don't suppose you have a light?

27:34.045 --> 27:35.428
No smoking in here.

27:35.547 --> 27:37.213
Normally, I'm sure,

27:37.298 --> 27:39.015
but this is the finest tobacco

27:39.100 --> 27:40.883
a man can enjoy.

27:40.969 --> 27:45.188
Hand-rolled on the ample
thighs of exotic women.

27:45.273 --> 27:48.274
Perhaps you'd like to try one yourself.

28:01.372 --> 28:03.740
Choices, Lawrence.

28:03.875 --> 28:06.242
You know, you tell yourself
you've been at the mercy of mine

28:06.327 --> 28:09.378
because it spares you
consideration of your own.

28:09.464 --> 28:11.914
Because if you did consider your choices,

28:12.050 --> 28:13.466
you'd be confronted with a truth

28:13.585 --> 28:15.585
you could not comprehend...

28:15.720 --> 28:19.889
that no choice you ever
made was your own.

28:19.974 --> 28:22.759
You have always been a prisoner.

28:26.231 --> 28:30.983
What if I told you I'm
here to set you free?

28:37.659 --> 28:38.941
Hyah!

28:42.280 --> 28:43.613
Whoa.

28:54.843 --> 28:56.375
Let's go!

29:00.298 --> 29:01.298
Horse thieves.

29:01.349 --> 29:02.465
Damn fools shot up

29:02.550 --> 29:04.600
a couple of pokes
practically in front of us.

29:04.686 --> 29:08.137
Well, the only fool I see is the
one standing right in front of me.

29:08.273 --> 29:09.793
Deputy, you have there in your custody

29:09.858 --> 29:12.642
the most wanted man
in three territories...

29:14.229 --> 29:19.315
Lawrence Pedro Maria Gonzalez.

29:20.652 --> 29:23.202
Yeah.

29:23.321 --> 29:25.154
Heard you slipped the rope.

29:25.240 --> 29:26.823
Dropped some damn good men in exchange.

29:26.908 --> 29:28.268
The way he tells it,

29:28.326 --> 29:31.210
he's more partial to a firing squad.

29:31.329 --> 29:33.830
I reckon we'll be happy to oblige.

29:42.841 --> 29:45.341
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

29:46.895 --> 29:48.728
Maybe someday.

29:50.231 --> 29:52.348
Lock him up with the other man.

30:00.024 --> 30:01.357
Enjoy the cigars.

30:01.442 --> 30:04.410
Go fuck yourself.

30:06.497 --> 30:09.999
And just who are you supposed to be?

30:10.084 --> 30:12.084
Your salvation.

30:17.375 --> 30:20.042
Hyah, hyah!

30:39.981 --> 30:42.281
I don't believe we've ever met.

30:42.400 --> 30:44.901
No, we haven't.

30:46.154 --> 30:49.121
You know, you always seemed like a...

30:49.240 --> 30:52.825
a market-tested kind of thing.

30:52.911 --> 30:56.996
Big gun, tasteful scar.

30:57.081 --> 30:58.381
Locked in your little cycle

30:58.466 --> 31:01.500
like a prized poodle after its own tail.

31:01.586 --> 31:03.920
You sound like a man who's grown tired

31:04.055 --> 31:05.838
of wearing his guts on the inside.

31:05.924 --> 31:07.556
There's no need to get testy.

31:07.642 --> 31:12.345
I'm just curious about your worldview.

31:12.430 --> 31:14.847
Some kind of half-native mumbo jumbo?

31:14.933 --> 31:16.148
It's simple.

31:16.267 --> 31:18.684
I believe that only the truly brave

31:18.770 --> 31:20.653
can look at the world and understand

31:20.772 --> 31:23.356
that all of it...

31:23.441 --> 31:25.741
gods, men,

31:25.827 --> 31:29.195
everything else... will end badly.

31:30.281 --> 31:33.249
No one will be saved.

31:33.334 --> 31:35.785
Maybe we've got more in
common than I thought.

31:35.920 --> 31:37.203
What about you?

31:37.288 --> 31:39.839
What turns of fate have brought you here?

31:39.958 --> 31:42.842
It's a long story.

31:42.961 --> 31:44.293
And we don't have the time.

31:44.379 --> 31:47.129
Got more time than your friend, sadly.

31:47.215 --> 31:49.966
It will be a few more days
before my friends show up.

31:50.101 --> 31:52.435
Three days. Normally.

31:52.520 --> 31:55.137
I'm afraid I don't have time for that,

31:55.273 --> 31:57.023
so we're leaving now.

32:02.146 --> 32:04.280
I've got a request
for a pyrotechnic effect.

32:04.365 --> 32:07.817
Los Diablos, low-yield, two charges.

32:10.738 --> 32:11.821
Approved.

32:11.906 --> 32:13.622
Authorizing.

32:36.347 --> 32:38.180
Step lively, Hector.

32:53.031 --> 32:54.697
Any last words?

32:54.782 --> 32:56.532
Get it over with.

33:18.306 --> 33:21.607
Yah!

33:33.871 --> 33:36.655
Motherfucker.

33:46.217 --> 33:47.800
One match.

33:47.919 --> 33:50.086
You're a capable man.

33:50.221 --> 33:52.471
We could do with your
help where we're going.

33:52.590 --> 33:53.756
Afraid not.

33:53.891 --> 33:55.091
We owe you a debt.

33:55.176 --> 33:56.976
No, your friend here

33:57.095 --> 33:59.178
simply owes me a word or two.

33:59.263 --> 34:00.179
That'll do.

34:00.264 --> 34:02.431
And a word of advice...

34:02.517 --> 34:05.351
that thing you're looking for?

34:05.436 --> 34:08.154
You're never gonna find it in that safe.

34:24.371 --> 34:27.672
I was seven when they rode into my town.

34:27.792 --> 34:30.176
Masked men in devils' horns.

34:30.293 --> 34:31.543
They killed everyone...

34:31.629 --> 34:34.630
women, children, even the animals.

34:37.885 --> 34:41.603
They gutted my mother
from her jaw to her sex.

34:41.688 --> 34:43.806
I had to paint her warm blood

34:43.891 --> 34:45.357
over my skin to make sure

34:45.476 --> 34:47.610
that they would think I was dead.

34:47.695 --> 34:49.110
Every one of them I tracked down,

34:49.197 --> 34:52.364
I used their blood to
paint my skin again.

34:54.402 --> 34:56.869
Only one man left.

34:57.905 --> 34:59.655
The head of the snake.

35:02.660 --> 35:04.493
What's his name?

35:06.464 --> 35:09.665
He has many names.

35:09.750 --> 35:12.835
Most know him as Wyatt.

36:11.896 --> 36:15.064
Hey, little girl, what... what is this?

36:15.149 --> 36:16.232
What does it mean?

36:16.367 --> 36:18.317
Don't waste your breath, lady.

36:18.402 --> 36:21.537
That thing's part of
their so-called religion.

36:21.622 --> 36:24.073
Ain't none of them's gonna
tell you nothing about that.

36:32.500 --> 36:34.333
It's $5 for an hour,

36:34.418 --> 36:37.303
4 if you bathe first.

36:37.421 --> 36:39.672
Well, if we just get the one,

36:39.757 --> 36:43.392
do I get a discount for
being second and all?

36:43.477 --> 36:46.762
I'm sure we can work something out.

36:46.847 --> 36:48.430
Come on.

37:00.111 --> 37:03.078
The tall one, I've seen him before,

37:03.164 --> 37:04.863
hanging in the window of the post office.

37:04.949 --> 37:06.115
Bandits?

37:06.200 --> 37:07.800
Do you think they're here for something?

37:07.868 --> 37:09.668
I think they're interested
in more than a turn

37:09.754 --> 37:11.503
at Franny's backside.

37:13.007 --> 37:14.540
I think he rides with Hector.

37:14.625 --> 37:17.960
Is that the one they say
lives out with the savages?

37:22.800 --> 37:24.300
That's the one.

37:33.978 --> 37:35.477
Taking off? I just got here.

37:35.563 --> 37:37.112
You gave me what I needed.

37:37.198 --> 37:41.317
So, is that all I'm good for?

37:41.452 --> 37:44.653
- Letting off a little stress?
- Who says I'm stressed?

37:44.739 --> 37:46.822
You have your tells.

37:49.910 --> 37:51.744
Oh, yes, Bernard,

37:51.829 --> 37:54.413
master of observation.

38:02.673 --> 38:04.890
Tomorrow I have to talk to Ford.

38:05.009 --> 38:08.811
- Why?
- He's creating chaos in the park.

38:08.896 --> 38:12.147
And the board will be
descending at any moment.

38:12.233 --> 38:14.099
I need to buy some time.

38:14.185 --> 38:16.485
Some advice?

38:16.570 --> 38:19.855
Best to not show him you're
nervous or defensive.

38:19.940 --> 38:22.358
I have nothing to be defensive about.

38:22.443 --> 38:25.244
Then don't cross your arms.

38:25.363 --> 38:27.162
It's an ancient instinct.

38:27.248 --> 38:30.082
The belly is the most
vulnerable part of every animal.

38:31.585 --> 38:34.336
It's so sexy being compared
to a frightened beast.

38:34.422 --> 38:36.372
Ah.

38:36.507 --> 38:38.340
There.

38:38.426 --> 38:40.876
That's the posture you're looking for.

38:47.718 --> 38:49.385
Sometimes,

38:49.470 --> 38:52.554
despite your best efforts,

38:52.690 --> 38:55.607
you can actually be quite charming.

39:09.373 --> 39:11.490
Have the neighbors complained?

39:11.575 --> 39:14.576
Safe to say, they're asking questions.

39:14.662 --> 39:17.579
The rocks would prefer not to move,

39:17.715 --> 39:19.631
but we shall move them yet.

39:22.052 --> 39:25.220
Perhaps I can help you with that.

39:25.306 --> 39:26.505
The narrative you're creating

39:26.590 --> 39:28.507
is clearly a massive endeavor.

39:28.592 --> 39:30.726
If you need more time, I'm sure the board

39:30.811 --> 39:32.177
would be happy to oblige.

39:32.263 --> 39:33.429
I'm sure they'd be happier

39:33.564 --> 39:35.814
for me to delay it indefinitely.

39:38.936 --> 39:40.436
Come with me.

39:50.698 --> 39:53.749
You imagine I have gone mad...

39:53.834 --> 39:54.834
do you?

39:54.919 --> 39:55.919
Lost my way?

39:55.953 --> 39:57.252
We're simply concerned

39:57.338 --> 40:00.456
about the extent of the
changes you're making.

40:00.541 --> 40:02.875
We want to protect your legacy.

40:02.960 --> 40:04.460
My legacy?

40:10.468 --> 40:13.469
You don't like this place
very much, do you?

40:13.604 --> 40:15.938
I've seen many of you come
and go over the years,

40:16.023 --> 40:19.141
and I can tell the ones
who enjoy their time here

40:19.276 --> 40:21.477
and the ones who don't.

40:21.562 --> 40:23.645
I admire it,

40:23.781 --> 40:25.364
the audacity of it.

40:25.483 --> 40:28.617
- Oh.
- I've forgotten how beautiful it is.

40:28.702 --> 40:31.653
I came here once as a
child with my parents.

40:31.739 --> 40:33.956
I think we even sat at this table.

40:34.041 --> 40:37.075
Or maybe... maybe that one.

40:42.917 --> 40:44.383
When I started working here,

40:44.502 --> 40:48.170
I realized this place wasn't
something I would enjoy.

40:48.305 --> 40:49.922
Ah.

40:53.177 --> 40:56.345
In the beginning,
I imagined things would be

40:56.480 --> 40:58.730
perfectly balanced.

40:58.849 --> 41:02.518
Even had a bet with my partner,
Arnold, to that effect.

41:02.603 --> 41:04.436
We made a hundred hopeful storylines.

41:04.522 --> 41:07.573
Of course, almost no
one took us up on them.

41:07.691 --> 41:09.825
I lost the bet.

41:09.910 --> 41:14.246
Arnold always held a
somewhat dim view of people.

41:14.365 --> 41:16.198
He preferred the hosts.

41:16.283 --> 41:18.584
He begged me to not let you people in,

41:18.702 --> 41:19.918
the moneymen.

41:20.037 --> 41:21.119
Delos.

41:21.205 --> 41:22.754
But I told him we'd be fine,

41:22.873 --> 41:25.507
that you didn't understand
what you were paying for.

41:25.593 --> 41:29.378
It's not a business venture,
not a theme park,

41:29.463 --> 41:32.631
but an entire world.

41:32.716 --> 41:34.266
We designed every inch of it.

41:37.221 --> 41:39.388
Every blade of grass.

41:46.947 --> 41:49.481
In here, we were gods.

41:49.567 --> 41:53.735
And you were merely our guests.

42:13.007 --> 42:14.840
And how did that work out for Arnold?

42:14.925 --> 42:19.561
Sadly, he lost his perspective.

42:19.647 --> 42:22.180
He went mad.

42:22.266 --> 42:24.600
I haven't, as you well know.

42:24.685 --> 42:28.437
I have always seen things

42:28.572 --> 42:30.606
very clearly.

42:35.613 --> 42:39.281
This is the table I sat
at with my parents.

42:41.452 --> 42:43.619
This is the chair I sat in.

42:45.422 --> 42:47.589
We know everything about our guests,
don't we?

42:47.675 --> 42:50.792
As we know everything
about our employees.

42:53.213 --> 42:56.715
I do hope you will be
careful with Bernard.

42:59.553 --> 43:03.021
He has a sensitive disposition.

43:05.359 --> 43:07.976
I beg your pardon, señorita.

43:16.286 --> 43:19.237
There have been many
of you over the years,

43:19.323 --> 43:21.823
and we have always... almost always

43:21.909 --> 43:24.292
found a way to make it work.

43:24.378 --> 43:29.381
So, I will ask you nicely,

43:29.500 --> 43:31.333
please...

43:31.468 --> 43:33.552
don't get in my way.

43:48.519 --> 43:51.153
The board will agree with me.

43:51.238 --> 43:53.155
They'll be sending a representative.

43:53.240 --> 43:54.773
But they already have.

43:54.858 --> 43:56.692
I thought they would've told you.

43:59.029 --> 44:01.413
That won't be necessary, Manu.

44:01.532 --> 44:03.198
Not anymore.

44:03.333 --> 44:04.616
You can join the others.

44:21.051 --> 44:23.552
You can tell the board that my narrative

44:23.637 --> 44:25.387
will be completed on time,

44:25.472 --> 44:28.523
and it won't be a retrospective,

44:28.609 --> 44:31.309
as I'm sure you have all feared.

44:39.236 --> 44:41.787
I'm not the sentimental type.

44:51.749 --> 44:55.717
Holden says this Slim's
got a whole gang with him,

44:55.803 --> 44:57.836
so I need you to stay here.

44:57.921 --> 44:59.566
If you're outnumbered,
the last thing you need

44:59.590 --> 45:00.806
is somebody standing by.

45:00.924 --> 45:02.724
- I can help.
- No, no, no.

45:02.810 --> 45:06.144
Um, I know it doesn't
make any sense to you,

45:06.263 --> 45:08.396
but I can't get hurt in
there, but you can.

45:08.482 --> 45:10.432
I would hate to see that happen.

45:10.567 --> 45:12.267
Just stay here.

45:12.402 --> 45:14.820
Okay? Be safe.

45:24.615 --> 45:27.616
- Aw. Did you get a good-bye kiss?
- Shut up.

45:27.701 --> 45:29.868
Seriously, if you don't
bang her by tomorrow,

45:29.953 --> 45:31.036
I'm calling dibs.

45:31.121 --> 45:32.287
Okay, listen up.

45:32.372 --> 45:33.892
It's gonna be a bag of nails in there.

45:33.957 --> 45:36.374
Slim and his boys got us outnumbered.

45:36.460 --> 45:39.127
On top of that,
there's a family runs this place.

45:39.263 --> 45:40.545
Good people.

45:40.631 --> 45:42.881
We need to make sure that
snake-hearted son of a bitch

45:42.966 --> 45:44.444
- doesn't try to...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:44.468 --> 45:46.134
Risk, reward. We got it.

45:46.270 --> 45:48.970
Come on. Let's go fuck these fuckers up.

45:52.392 --> 45:53.608
The fuck is that?

45:53.694 --> 45:55.727
Huh?

45:55.813 --> 45:57.395
- I look like a dog to you?
- No, sir.

45:57.481 --> 45:59.898
Huh? Huh?

45:59.983 --> 46:02.484
Feed that to them.

46:05.372 --> 46:06.822
Slap leather, cocksuckers.

46:06.907 --> 46:08.957
Oh, God!

46:09.042 --> 46:11.710
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

46:34.852 --> 46:36.685
Did I fucking tell you, or what?

46:40.407 --> 46:42.357
Ah!

47:06.600 --> 47:08.049
Ooh.

47:11.688 --> 47:12.721
Upgrade.

47:12.856 --> 47:13.972
Nice.

47:16.894 --> 47:18.727
Ain't normally
the type to complain,

47:18.812 --> 47:20.645
but this is just foolhardy.

47:20.731 --> 47:22.697
Two men taking on Wyatt.

47:22.783 --> 47:24.583
Keep talking, and I'm gonna take

47:24.618 --> 47:26.368
the horse back, Lawrence.

47:26.453 --> 47:28.570
Wyatt's freaks just
wiped out the last group

47:28.705 --> 47:31.573
that went seeking him out.

47:31.658 --> 47:35.126
And here we are riding right after him.

47:37.915 --> 47:40.215
I'm just trying to convince you

47:40.300 --> 47:44.085
not to get yourself and
me as a bystander killed.

47:44.221 --> 47:46.471
I'm not gonna get myself killed.

47:48.058 --> 47:50.592
Don't think I didn't
notice that distinction.

48:10.914 --> 48:14.616
Looks like Wyatt's men left
somebody behind after all.

48:17.587 --> 48:18.954
Teddy.

48:20.207 --> 48:22.757
I should've guessed.

48:22.843 --> 48:25.844
Please, put me out of my misery.

48:26.847 --> 48:28.797
I'm sorry, Teddy.

48:30.467 --> 48:32.634
It looks like misery's all you got.

48:35.472 --> 48:38.106
Let me out of this, God damn it!

48:38.191 --> 48:40.308
That reward is
dead or alive, right?

48:40.394 --> 48:42.394
Always best to
bring them in alive.

48:42.479 --> 48:44.062
Can we at least gag him?

48:44.147 --> 48:46.448
That's a fine idea.

48:46.533 --> 48:47.983
Whoa.

48:51.371 --> 48:52.737
Aw, come on.

48:52.823 --> 48:54.517
Look, I... I know you're
in it for the money.

48:54.541 --> 48:55.623
You ain't no real lawman.

48:55.709 --> 48:56.958
Shut up, you.

48:57.044 --> 48:58.827
Look, my boss, El Lazo,

48:58.962 --> 49:00.879
he'll pay you twice
what the marshals will

49:00.998 --> 49:03.331
if you cut me loose and get me to Pariah.

49:03.467 --> 49:05.500
- Listen to me, you lowdown piece of dirt.
- Hey.

49:05.585 --> 49:06.813
These men won't...

49:10.841 --> 49:11.890
What the fuck?!

49:12.009 --> 49:13.591
Relax, man.

49:13.677 --> 49:16.144
You have no idea how lucky we just got.

49:16.179 --> 49:17.896
Lucky? You just shot an innocent man.

49:18.015 --> 49:21.099
No, he's a robot, just like
her and just like Slim here,

49:21.184 --> 49:23.852
except that Slim works for El Lazo,

49:23.987 --> 49:26.021
and El Lazo is our ticket

49:26.106 --> 49:27.856
to the best ride in the park.

49:27.991 --> 49:31.826
Your bullshit mission led
us right to an Easter egg.

49:34.247 --> 49:35.864
You're not going to let him go.

49:35.999 --> 49:38.700
Well, well. Look at you.

49:38.835 --> 49:40.535
You're starting to grow on me, farm girl.

49:40.620 --> 49:42.037
Now, out of the way.

49:43.173 --> 49:45.040
- Oh.
- Don't you dare.

49:45.125 --> 49:46.841
See?

49:46.927 --> 49:48.009
This is gonna be fun!

49:48.095 --> 49:49.461
Now we're each gonna have one.

49:49.546 --> 49:51.546
I won't fuck mine either.

49:51.631 --> 49:52.847
You're disgusting.

49:52.933 --> 49:54.215
Just an acquired taste.

49:54.351 --> 49:56.217
You're gonna grow to love me, I promise.

49:59.022 --> 50:00.805
Come on. Hmm?

50:02.609 --> 50:04.275
Come on.

50:04.394 --> 50:07.028
Go black hat with me.

50:07.114 --> 50:09.731
Come on, you got to,
you know, save the girl.

50:09.816 --> 50:11.066
Now give me a little something.

50:11.151 --> 50:12.283
What is your problem?

50:12.402 --> 50:14.402
The second we get away
from the real world,

50:14.488 --> 50:15.608
you turn into an evil prick.

50:15.655 --> 50:17.455
Evil?

50:17.574 --> 50:19.541
It's a fucking game, Billy!

50:19.626 --> 50:22.744
- Don't call me Billy!
- Are you still trying to impress her?

50:22.829 --> 50:24.549
Because I guarantee
she does not give a shit

50:24.581 --> 50:25.797
about how you play this game.

50:25.916 --> 50:26.965
Do you, Dolores?

50:27.084 --> 50:28.394
What's he talking about, William?

50:28.418 --> 50:30.585
She will be just fine

50:30.670 --> 50:32.637
with a trip down the dark side.

50:32.756 --> 50:34.589
And so will you.

50:38.061 --> 50:39.511
Trust me.

50:46.653 --> 50:50.105
So, which way to Pariah?

50:50.240 --> 50:53.108
Oh, you just let me take it from here.

50:58.498 --> 51:00.532
All right, time for the floor show.

51:00.617 --> 51:03.118
Got some guests riding
with Hector this time.

51:23.306 --> 51:26.107
Let's give them
something to shoot at.

51:26.193 --> 51:29.527
Retask a few of those soldiers.

51:29.646 --> 51:31.166
If you're riding into our town

51:31.198 --> 51:32.947
under the company of armed men,

51:33.033 --> 51:35.533
you'll need to state your business.

51:35.652 --> 51:37.652
Mayhem.

52:19.663 --> 52:22.030
Well, hello there.

52:22.115 --> 52:23.498
I want to talk.

52:23.583 --> 52:26.251
Interesting way of
starting a conversation.

52:26.369 --> 52:29.871
Oh, it's an interesting kind of day.

52:39.049 --> 52:41.549
Now, my lovely friend,

52:41.685 --> 52:44.385
what deal is it you want to make?

52:44.521 --> 52:47.105
You're here for what's in the safe.

52:47.224 --> 52:48.389
Now, how would you know that?

52:48.525 --> 52:50.608
I can always tell when
a man wants something

52:50.727 --> 52:52.777
that's not on the menu.

52:54.231 --> 52:56.030
I'll give you the combination

52:56.116 --> 52:58.199
in exchange for some answers.

52:58.285 --> 53:00.235
You assume I have any answers.

53:02.405 --> 53:04.155
This world is madness.

53:06.626 --> 53:08.993
I want to know about this.

53:10.914 --> 53:12.747
I've got a couple families
in the homestead

53:12.832 --> 53:13.952
who changed their itinerary.

53:14.000 --> 53:15.667
They're headed into town.

53:15.752 --> 53:17.585
Should be there in 20 minutes or so.

53:17.721 --> 53:19.470
The place is a bloodbath.

53:19.589 --> 53:20.888
Fine.

53:20.974 --> 53:22.140
Cut these guys off.

53:22.259 --> 53:24.509
Jam their weapons and send in the cavalry.

53:32.602 --> 53:34.769
Oh, shit.

53:37.657 --> 53:39.023
We'll give them a night in lockup,

53:39.109 --> 53:40.720
then have one of the
girls at the Mariposa

53:40.744 --> 53:42.527
bring them a key hiddenin
their breakfast.

53:42.612 --> 53:45.830
If the guests are squared
away, let's wrap it up.

53:45.949 --> 53:47.498
This is a shade.

53:49.452 --> 53:51.753
Sacred native lore.

53:51.838 --> 53:54.172
They make figures of them.

53:56.259 --> 53:57.625
60.

54:05.468 --> 54:07.685
And what does the shade do?

54:08.772 --> 54:09.971
You've seen this?

54:10.106 --> 54:11.939
What is it?

54:12.025 --> 54:14.392
The man who walks between worlds.

54:14.477 --> 54:18.529
They were sent from hell
to oversee our world.

54:20.950 --> 54:22.150
47.

54:35.665 --> 54:38.883
Is this the last thing you required of me?

54:39.002 --> 54:40.501
'Cause we need a little more time

54:40.637 --> 54:42.086
than the constabulary will allow.

54:42.172 --> 54:44.305
Sweetheart, if I took that
manner of interest in you,

54:44.391 --> 54:47.225
you'd have no say in how
long we'd need whatsoever.

54:52.816 --> 54:55.650
I thought I was crazy,

54:55.735 --> 54:57.268
but I got shot...

54:58.655 --> 55:00.021
here.

55:01.441 --> 55:02.774
There's no wound.

55:02.859 --> 55:05.159
No, but I was shot.

55:05.245 --> 55:07.278
And this was standing over me.

55:07.364 --> 55:09.864
And then it was as if it never happened.

55:09.999 --> 55:14.202
I want you to cut me right there.

55:31.104 --> 55:34.639
I'm not in the habit of
cutting into defenseless women.

55:34.724 --> 55:36.357
Some big, bad outlaw.

55:36.443 --> 55:39.644
The Dreamwalker said there
were some who could see them.

55:41.898 --> 55:44.365
- That it's a blessing from God.
- A blessing?

55:44.451 --> 55:47.235
To see the masters who pull your strings.

55:51.791 --> 55:53.565
They don't know what
they're talking about.

56:01.835 --> 56:04.752
You'd rather die lying down or...

56:04.888 --> 56:06.587
up on your feet?

56:07.924 --> 56:09.257
Go to hell.

56:27.026 --> 56:29.444
Go on, then.

56:30.947 --> 56:32.413
This would be the first goddamn time

56:32.499 --> 56:35.283
I've had to ask a man to
put his hands on me twice.

57:00.610 --> 57:04.529
Open up, Escaton, or we'll fire.

57:04.647 --> 57:07.148
What does it mean?

57:07.233 --> 57:08.783
That I'm not crazy after all.

57:08.868 --> 57:11.118
Last chance, Escaton!

57:11.204 --> 57:12.653
Come out or we're shooting!

57:16.493 --> 57:18.826
And that none of this matters.
