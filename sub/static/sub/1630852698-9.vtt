WEBVTT

00:13.513 --> 00:14.806
-Cheong-san!
-What the hell?

00:20.395 --> 00:21.479
Damn it.

00:23.356 --> 00:24.482
On-jo.

00:39.497 --> 00:40.331
Su-hyeok!

00:41.666 --> 00:42.959
Su-hyeok, are you okay?

00:48.006 --> 00:48.923
Shit.

00:58.892 --> 00:59.893
Who the hell are you guys?

00:59.976 --> 01:02.979
What about you?
Are you from the One Heart club?

01:04.689 --> 01:06.441
ONE HEART

01:06.524 --> 01:07.400
It's me.

01:08.985 --> 01:09.861
Me.

01:11.237 --> 01:12.322
Don't you know me?

01:13.406 --> 01:15.617
How the fuck do you not know me?

01:15.700 --> 01:16.618
I know you.

01:16.701 --> 01:18.244
I said it again and again.

01:19.287 --> 01:20.789
You were the bullies' gopher.

01:23.249 --> 01:27.087
Call me that again, and you're dead.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.547
You were never a thug or a good student.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.467
And now you're not a zombie or a human.

01:34.385 --> 01:35.929
Then and now…

01:38.181 --> 01:39.182
you're nothing.

01:41.142 --> 01:42.936
I'm not going to just kill you.

01:45.438 --> 01:49.150
I'll gouge out both of your eyes
and throw you to the zombies.

01:49.776 --> 01:50.693
Yes.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.656
Everyone but Cheong-san, run away.

01:56.032 --> 01:57.534
Unless you want to die with him.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.375
You're all dead.

02:07.127 --> 02:07.961
Cheong-san.

02:09.879 --> 02:10.880
Get out of the way!

03:28.666 --> 03:29.918
Let go.

03:30.001 --> 03:31.711
Let go, fuck!

03:41.679 --> 03:43.097
Let go, fuck!

03:54.067 --> 03:57.278
You smell nice.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.953
You and I are on the same side.

04:05.828 --> 04:06.955
Smell me.

04:07.622 --> 04:08.915
Go on.

04:08.998 --> 04:09.874
Get lost.

04:37.151 --> 04:38.486
Your shirt ripped.

04:38.569 --> 04:39.445
It's okay.

04:42.323 --> 04:43.491
Fuck.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.875
What the hell is he?

04:52.959 --> 04:54.460
He was so strong.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.672
Are you hurt anywhere else?

04:58.423 --> 04:59.590
Did your glasses break?

04:59.674 --> 05:00.717
What the hell is he?

05:01.551 --> 05:02.385
You're bleeding.

05:02.468 --> 05:03.970
-So he's Gwi-nam?
-What? Damn it.

05:04.512 --> 05:05.763
I guess so.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.098
-What about me?
-Let me see.

05:07.181 --> 05:08.641
My legs are shaking.

05:09.225 --> 05:10.059
You're okay.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.436
It hurts like hell.

05:40.923 --> 05:42.091
Damn it.

05:43.384 --> 05:45.094
We're on the same side.

06:00.234 --> 06:06.407
EXAMINATION ROOM

06:14.374 --> 06:15.416
Here you go.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.793
Thank you.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.562
The homology test on the virus
is not producing results.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.231
What does that mean?

06:39.732 --> 06:41.943
All living organisms come from somewhere,

06:42.026 --> 06:45.488
and a homology test shows us the origin.

06:45.571 --> 06:48.991
It's like a genealogy for viruses.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.993
But we can't figure it out.

06:52.370 --> 06:54.497
Are you saying
it's a completely new virus?

06:54.580 --> 06:57.917
The KDCA is also analyzing it,
but they can't identify it either.

06:59.377 --> 07:03.214
We need to identify it
before we can treat them.

07:07.343 --> 07:08.761
You people are the experts.

07:09.846 --> 07:12.390
How could you not have identified it yet?

07:14.350 --> 07:15.476
The strange thing is,

07:16.227 --> 07:18.813
the RNA structure changes
every time we test it.

07:20.231 --> 07:23.943
The virus seems to be evolving on its own.

07:30.700 --> 07:33.244
We rescued a detective
from Hyosan Police Station.

07:33.327 --> 07:34.912
He seems to know about the virus.

07:39.375 --> 07:41.377
There's a laptop
in Hyosan High School and--

07:41.461 --> 07:42.378
Hey.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.589
You need to start from the beginning.

07:45.173 --> 07:46.466
But it's urgent.

07:46.549 --> 07:47.383
Damn it.

07:49.635 --> 07:52.597
The virus that's spreading in Hyosan
is called the Jonas Virus.

07:52.680 --> 07:55.766
Lee Byeong-chan, a science teacher
at Hyosan High School, created it.

07:55.850 --> 07:58.311
There's a laptop
in the science lab of the school.

07:59.312 --> 08:02.565
He said it had everything necessary
to resolve this wretched situation.

08:02.648 --> 08:03.691
Laptop?

08:04.442 --> 08:06.861
-Is his story credible?
-Yes.

08:07.695 --> 08:09.739
The initial reports of the outbreak

08:09.822 --> 08:12.241
were from Hyosan Hospital's ER
and Hyosan High School.

08:12.825 --> 08:15.786
The student that was taken to the ER
was a student from Hyosan High.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.498
Thus, I'm certain
that Hyosan High is ground zero.

08:28.382 --> 08:30.009
Continue to question that detective.

08:30.551 --> 08:32.470
Send a Special Mission Unit
to Hyosan High.

08:33.554 --> 08:34.639
Bring me the laptop.

08:35.556 --> 08:36.432
Yes, sir.

08:42.939 --> 08:43.814
Eun-ji.

08:44.440 --> 08:45.483
Eun-ji!

08:45.566 --> 08:47.109
WAITING STATION

08:56.827 --> 08:58.829
Are you okay?

08:59.956 --> 09:01.666
I thought you had died.

09:01.749 --> 09:03.376
You let me go knowing I'd die.

09:04.585 --> 09:06.087
I'm sorry.

09:06.671 --> 09:07.838
I was--

09:07.922 --> 09:08.923
It's fine.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.009
That's who you are.

09:14.095 --> 09:14.929
Hey.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.306
Want to hear some good news?

09:17.890 --> 09:19.183
I set fire to the school.

09:20.268 --> 09:22.270
It's probably burned to the ground by now.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.356
You set the school on fire?

09:25.439 --> 09:27.984
Yes. You're happy too, right?

09:29.318 --> 09:30.736
Are you all right?

09:32.280 --> 09:33.239
I'm fine.

09:34.448 --> 09:35.324
Why?

09:36.158 --> 09:37.868
You seem strange.
You're not your usual self.

09:40.788 --> 09:41.831
I'm hungry.

09:43.249 --> 09:44.875
I get worked up when I'm hungry.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.171
Do you want this, then?

09:49.964 --> 09:52.466
They're giving these out,
but the line's really long.

09:53.050 --> 09:54.010
You eat first.

09:55.177 --> 09:56.637
I don't want that.

09:58.097 --> 09:59.599
This is all they have.

10:00.182 --> 10:03.269
Not that. I want to eat something else.

10:04.729 --> 10:05.688
Like what?

10:10.443 --> 10:11.319
You?

10:12.153 --> 10:13.029
Me?

10:14.947 --> 10:15.781
Yes.

10:16.699 --> 10:17.658
I want to eat you.

10:29.003 --> 10:30.296
Damn, it stings.

10:34.216 --> 10:36.427
What the hell is with that Gwi-nam guy?

10:37.970 --> 10:39.180
You said he was bitten.

10:41.349 --> 10:42.183
I don't know.

10:42.725 --> 10:45.061
It looks like he became a different being.

10:45.144 --> 10:46.729
I don't think he can die.

10:46.812 --> 10:48.439
What if he climbs up here again?

10:51.233 --> 10:52.568
That asshole is bad,

10:54.362 --> 10:56.405
but to be honest,
I'm scared of Nam-ra too.

10:57.281 --> 10:58.699
You saw her fighting earlier.

10:59.700 --> 11:00.576
I think

11:01.452 --> 11:03.829
it's reasonable to assume
they're both hambies--

11:05.247 --> 11:06.123
What?

11:08.668 --> 11:09.919
You're really okay, right?

11:12.463 --> 11:13.798
You won't do that to us, right?

11:16.050 --> 11:18.344
Will you believe me if I say I won't?

11:19.387 --> 11:20.680
Must you talk like that?

11:21.931 --> 11:23.683
Can't you try to make us believe you?

11:26.185 --> 11:27.728
We're going to be together anyway.

11:40.074 --> 11:44.829
I… have never done anything but study.

11:47.123 --> 11:50.126
Not because I was naive
but because I was a coward.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.629
I was scared my grades would drop

11:53.713 --> 11:56.132
and that my mom would get mad.
So I didn't do anything else.

11:57.466 --> 11:59.510
I was too scared to make friends too.

12:01.303 --> 12:05.516
My mom always asked
about how well they did at school,

12:05.599 --> 12:08.269
what their father did for a living,
how big their house is…

12:16.193 --> 12:20.656
I never thought I'd get to sit
by a fire with all of you like this.

12:25.244 --> 12:27.037
It's really nice.

12:29.081 --> 12:30.458
It's my first time.

12:32.918 --> 12:34.462
If we get out of here,

12:35.671 --> 12:37.006
let's gather around a fire

12:38.132 --> 12:39.717
and hang out like this again.

12:42.511 --> 12:45.765
I really hope we can.

12:47.683 --> 12:48.768
Sure, let's do that.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.105
If anyone lights a fire…

12:56.150 --> 12:57.485
let's all gather together.

13:01.322 --> 13:03.532
Sorry, Prez.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.874
Did she just smile?
That looked so awkward.

13:13.167 --> 13:15.127
God, come on.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.463
What? What now?

13:17.546 --> 13:19.507
Why don't you two just go out?

13:19.590 --> 13:21.050
You're being so loud.

13:21.133 --> 13:22.426
-Are you mad?
-Are you crazy?

13:23.552 --> 13:24.553
Hold on.

13:27.223 --> 13:28.641
Don't you hear that?

13:29.225 --> 13:30.059
Hear what?

13:30.142 --> 13:32.436
Why? Is someone coming again?

13:37.483 --> 13:38.359
They're coming.

13:43.364 --> 13:44.365
What's coming?

13:48.702 --> 13:49.578
What is it?

13:52.748 --> 13:54.041
I don't see anything.

13:58.295 --> 13:59.129
Wait.

13:59.630 --> 14:00.840
I hear a chopper.

14:15.354 --> 14:18.774
ALO Viper.
We've entered Hyosan High's airspace.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.860
TGT 1M, reporting.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.278
Fire.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.697
-Fire!
-It's coming.

14:24.780 --> 14:26.198
-Hey!
-This way. It's this way.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.324
Sir!

14:27.408 --> 14:29.785
-Over here! We're here!
-Over here!

14:29.869 --> 14:32.663
-Please help!
-Here!

14:32.746 --> 14:34.415
-Over here!
-Hey! Over here!

14:34.498 --> 14:36.125
-We're here!
-Here!

14:36.208 --> 14:37.835
Look at us, will you?

14:37.918 --> 14:39.169
Hey!

14:39.253 --> 14:40.254
Can't you see us?

14:40.337 --> 14:41.922
-We're here!
-Over here!

14:42.006 --> 14:43.632
-Here!
-Here!

14:43.716 --> 14:45.009
-Hey!
-Look at us!

14:45.092 --> 14:46.969
Over here! Look this way!

14:47.636 --> 14:50.848
ALO Viper. We've arrived at Hyosan High.

14:57.354 --> 14:58.898
-Here!
-Here! Over here!

14:58.981 --> 15:00.274
-Sir!
-Sir!

15:00.357 --> 15:02.234
-Over here!
-We're over here!

15:02.318 --> 15:04.111
-Hey!
-Here!

15:04.194 --> 15:06.322
-Over here!
-Over here!

15:06.405 --> 15:09.074
-Help us!
-We're going to live!

15:09.158 --> 15:11.285
He saw us! Over here!

15:12.036 --> 15:13.329
Over here!

15:13.412 --> 15:14.246
We're saved!

15:16.081 --> 15:17.791
We're going to live!

15:17.875 --> 15:19.335
Over here!

15:20.336 --> 15:21.837
Over here!

15:47.363 --> 15:49.031
-Here--
-Oh my God.

16:00.042 --> 16:02.711
Get down. All of you, down on the ground!

16:04.713 --> 16:05.547
Sir.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.257
Please save us.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.843
-Get down on the ground!
-Get down!

16:13.847 --> 16:15.599
Examining the area.

16:17.351 --> 16:18.352
Hyosan High rooftop.

16:18.435 --> 16:20.646
Nine survivors confirmed.

16:21.438 --> 16:22.272
Their condition?

16:22.856 --> 16:24.066
Checking temperatures now.

16:25.275 --> 16:26.193
Clear.

16:26.276 --> 16:27.903
I think they're checking if we're zombies.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.863
-Clear.
-Don't worry.

16:29.947 --> 16:30.823
Clear.

16:31.407 --> 16:32.241
Clear.

16:36.078 --> 16:37.121
Clear.

16:38.539 --> 16:39.832
Clear.

16:45.129 --> 16:45.963
Clear.

16:55.389 --> 16:56.807
Temperature is 34.5 degrees.

16:58.392 --> 16:59.810
Providing a warming blanket.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.693
One has hypothermia. The rest are normal.

17:09.778 --> 17:11.739
Rescue them after completing your mission.

17:11.822 --> 17:13.782
We'll rescue them
after completing our mission.

17:13.866 --> 17:14.700
Over.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.619
It's okay. They said they'll rescue us.

17:18.704 --> 17:19.663
It's over now.

17:21.582 --> 17:22.791
You may get up now.

17:27.421 --> 17:28.922
Are you the only survivors?

17:29.006 --> 17:30.174
We don't know.

17:31.175 --> 17:32.551
I'm sure there are more.

17:32.634 --> 17:34.678
We'll go down for a few minutes.

17:34.762 --> 17:35.971
Wait right here.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.556
Aren't you going to rescue us?

17:37.639 --> 17:38.599
We will.

17:39.516 --> 17:40.559
So don't go anywhere.

17:40.642 --> 17:42.561
Don't do anything. Just stay here.

17:42.644 --> 17:44.104
-Understand?
-Yes.

17:44.188 --> 17:45.022
Let's go.

17:59.953 --> 18:02.372
Three soldiers, ready to go.
Chopper, report.

18:19.181 --> 18:20.974
Viper, ready to go. Over.

18:21.058 --> 18:22.309
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

18:22.392 --> 18:23.560
Fuck, let's go.

18:23.644 --> 18:25.354
The zombies went toward the chopper.

18:25.437 --> 18:26.814
Let's get to the rooftop now.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.283
Let's go.

18:42.538 --> 18:43.413
What about him?

18:48.210 --> 18:49.419
Tie him up.

19:33.088 --> 19:34.840
-Be more gentle.
-Slowly.

19:34.923 --> 19:35.883
More gentle.

19:35.966 --> 19:37.634
-Is that okay?
-Yes, it's good.

19:37.718 --> 19:40.012
Don't put any straps on my stomach.

19:40.095 --> 19:41.513
Okay, I won't.

19:46.393 --> 19:49.813
The infected are entering
from the field and front gate.

19:51.106 --> 19:51.940
What's your status?

19:53.150 --> 19:55.277
We're clear. Moving in.

20:04.745 --> 20:06.538
Report on the situation.

20:12.461 --> 20:13.337
Hey.

20:13.962 --> 20:16.757
They plan to kill all the zombies
before they take us, right?

20:16.840 --> 20:18.967
I doubt that. There are only four of them.

20:20.260 --> 20:21.887
Isn't Special Mission the best?

20:23.555 --> 20:24.932
Are they looking for something?

20:26.183 --> 20:27.768
Isn't the science lab that way?

20:36.026 --> 20:37.945
-We're in.
-Do you have the package?

20:38.737 --> 20:39.571
Checking now.

20:46.578 --> 20:50.916
The infected are rushing toward you.
Viper, get ready to move out.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.753
Target not yet obtained.
Decrypting device.

20:54.836 --> 20:56.296
We have to go. Hurry!

20:59.424 --> 21:01.176
Decryption complete. Heading out.

21:15.565 --> 21:16.650
Moving out!

21:21.613 --> 21:24.700
Report your evacuation status
and situation inside the school.

21:25.993 --> 21:28.954
The infected are passing F2
and moving quickly to the science lab.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.748
Rescue the students
and return to the base.

21:32.249 --> 21:33.125
Yes, sir.

21:34.835 --> 21:37.671
Commander, we had an incident
in the quarantine camp.

21:37.754 --> 21:39.089
What is it? What happened?

21:39.172 --> 21:41.300
-Bring up monitor 34.
-Yes, sir.

21:46.388 --> 21:47.556
Rewind ten minutes.

21:51.935 --> 21:52.853
Where's the package?

21:58.692 --> 22:00.569
Come to the pick-up position. Over.

22:05.365 --> 22:07.367
-Master Sergeant. Go up first.
-Yes, sir.

22:08.910 --> 22:12.372
We'll pull you up one at a time.
Stay still even if you're scared.

22:12.456 --> 22:14.708
-Okay?
-Aren't you landing the chopper?

22:14.791 --> 22:16.668
We can't for safety reasons.

22:16.752 --> 22:19.504
He'll pull you in, so don't worry.

22:29.890 --> 22:33.268
You can't go all at once,
so let's go one by one.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.436
You can't take us all?

22:34.519 --> 22:36.813
We're taking all of you,
but you have to go up one by one.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.276
Ji-min. You go first.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.278
You go first. Go.

22:46.406 --> 22:47.366
Go first.

23:03.882 --> 23:05.133
Grab her!

23:05.217 --> 23:06.676
Calm down!

23:06.760 --> 23:07.594
Stay still!

23:26.863 --> 23:28.448
Stand back!

23:34.913 --> 23:36.039
What the hell is that?

23:37.791 --> 23:39.876
I think she's infected but asymptomatic.

23:44.798 --> 23:49.010
She's infected but showed no symptoms?

24:17.706 --> 24:20.041
You're saying normal people
and infected people

24:21.001 --> 24:22.461
cannot be differentiated.

24:24.129 --> 24:26.506
-Connect to the team at Hyosan High!
-Yes, sir.

24:30.135 --> 24:31.178
Don't rescue anyone.

24:32.387 --> 24:34.639
Please repeat. Do you mean everyone?

24:34.723 --> 24:37.184
We just discovered
an asymptomatic infected person.

24:37.267 --> 24:38.768
But their temperatures are fine.

24:38.852 --> 24:40.854
The girl who was brought here
was also fine.

24:40.937 --> 24:43.815
All our agents will be in danger
if one turns in the chopper.

24:43.899 --> 24:46.151
Open fire if they resist.

24:46.234 --> 24:47.652
But they're just students.

24:48.278 --> 24:50.530
Soldiers here have died!

24:50.614 --> 24:52.991
One girl attacked four soldiers!

24:55.076 --> 24:57.078
Understood. Over.

24:59.039 --> 25:02.584
Operation canceled!
We'll take only the package and pull out!

25:04.044 --> 25:05.003
Sir!

25:05.086 --> 25:06.630
I'm going back down.

25:07.214 --> 25:08.381
-She's coming down.
-Hey.

25:08.465 --> 25:09.591
She's coming down!

25:09.674 --> 25:11.426
-Why? What's wrong?
-She's coming down!

25:11.510 --> 25:12.552
Why is she coming down?

25:12.636 --> 25:14.679
-What's going on?
-I don't know!

25:14.763 --> 25:17.474
Why did you take that off? No.

25:20.685 --> 25:23.104
-What do you mean it's canceled?
-What are you doing?

25:23.813 --> 25:25.023
Please pull me back up.

25:25.106 --> 25:27.526
Pull me back up! Fuck! I won't go back.

25:27.609 --> 25:29.861
No!

25:29.945 --> 25:30.779
Take me with you!

25:30.862 --> 25:32.405
Sir. Please!

25:33.156 --> 25:34.741
I want to go!

25:35.325 --> 25:36.910
Take me with you!

25:37.536 --> 25:40.205
-Why won't you take us with you?
-Sir!

25:40.288 --> 25:41.498
Wait a second.

25:41.581 --> 25:42.749
What's wrong?

25:42.832 --> 25:44.042
We're not zombies.

25:45.460 --> 25:47.879
What are you waiting for? Open fire.

25:47.963 --> 25:49.339
Take me with you!

25:49.422 --> 25:50.382
Step back.

25:51.466 --> 25:53.176
Step back, or we'll shoot.

25:53.260 --> 25:54.261
Stand back!

25:55.887 --> 25:57.222
Get in the chopper.

25:57.305 --> 25:58.390
Open fire.

26:00.433 --> 26:03.645
Do you not hear me?
This is an order. Open fire!

26:04.229 --> 26:06.815
Sir. Can't you just take a few of us?

26:06.898 --> 26:09.067
Shoot, you bastard. Shoot them!

26:18.868 --> 26:20.704
Be quiet.

26:26.668 --> 26:28.753
-Quiet.
-Damn it.

26:30.797 --> 26:32.173
To the rooftop, right?

26:32.799 --> 26:34.092
Not that one, right?

26:34.175 --> 26:36.469
We can't get up there.
I mean this building.

26:37.762 --> 26:39.598
-Let's go.
-It's not that way.

26:40.098 --> 26:43.602
-What? Okay. Let's go.
-Hey. Help me.

26:43.685 --> 26:44.644
Shit.

26:45.937 --> 26:48.440
I'm begging you.
Please take just a few of us.

27:04.539 --> 27:05.415
Sir.

27:13.381 --> 27:14.257
I'm sorry.

27:48.708 --> 27:49.751
We have the package.

27:49.834 --> 27:51.419
All agents pulling out.

27:51.503 --> 27:52.462
Return to the base.

28:35.213 --> 28:37.716
Hey. Why is it coming this way?

28:38.299 --> 28:39.217
Did they see us?

28:54.107 --> 28:57.485
Over here! Here! Look here!

28:58.069 --> 28:59.487
Over here!

29:02.615 --> 29:03.825
Damn it.

29:06.870 --> 29:09.289
-We're fucked. Run!
-Shit.

29:22.719 --> 29:24.262
They abandoned us, right?

29:24.846 --> 29:25.722
Right?

29:26.973 --> 29:29.184
No one will come to save us now, right?

29:31.561 --> 29:32.687
Why did they do that?

29:33.772 --> 29:34.647
Maybe

29:35.940 --> 29:38.026
they fucking thought we were zombies.

29:39.277 --> 29:40.820
Then they would've killed us.

29:41.821 --> 29:43.031
They wouldn't have left

29:44.574 --> 29:45.950
without killing us.

29:55.001 --> 29:56.169
What are you doing?

29:58.004 --> 29:58.963
It's useless.

30:00.006 --> 30:02.759
No one's coming. No one is coming now.

30:28.910 --> 30:32.872
A victim stated that you
and your aide were accomplices

30:32.956 --> 30:36.793
in Kim U-sin and Nam So-ju's attack
on our soldiers during their escape.

30:38.336 --> 30:41.047
He kept denying your involvement.

30:41.130 --> 30:43.007
So we want to ask you some questions.

30:47.136 --> 30:48.763
Are you recording this?

30:48.847 --> 30:50.557
-Yes, we are.
-Wait a minute.

30:51.099 --> 30:54.018
Aren't you supposed
to inform us if you're recording?

30:54.102 --> 30:56.604
We will record this conversation.
Do you consent?

30:57.438 --> 30:59.774
Would you please point the camera
straight at me?

31:06.990 --> 31:08.157
Is it set?

31:08.241 --> 31:09.075
Yes.

31:15.039 --> 31:16.749
I'm Assembly Member Park Eun-hee.

31:17.584 --> 31:22.088
I am being interrogated
because I have been accused

31:22.171 --> 31:25.091
of aiding in the escape
of Nam So-ju and Kim U-sin,

31:25.174 --> 31:26.926
the firefighters who saved my life.

31:27.427 --> 31:30.138
I am not an accomplice.

31:32.015 --> 31:33.474
I was the principal offender.

31:35.018 --> 31:36.352
Ma'am! Seriously…

31:37.145 --> 31:38.396
Stop recording.

31:38.980 --> 31:39.856
Stay back.

31:41.357 --> 31:44.193
What are you doing?
Why are you doing this?

31:52.160 --> 31:53.369
Do as you please.

31:54.454 --> 31:56.039
I won't get involved anymore.

32:01.336 --> 32:05.131
Nam So-ju saved us,
notwithstanding the fact

32:05.214 --> 32:06.716
that his daughter was nearby.

32:07.425 --> 32:10.803
Although he tried to go save his daughter,

32:11.679 --> 32:13.181
the Martial Law Control stopped him.

32:15.099 --> 32:17.602
His daughter was everything to him.

32:18.686 --> 32:20.563
I said I'd take full responsibility

32:21.189 --> 32:24.734
and that he should escape using
all means necessary to save his daughter.

32:26.069 --> 32:28.529
Even if it's dangerous
and we're under martial law,

32:29.781 --> 32:32.533
no one can stop
a father's love for his child.

32:34.619 --> 32:37.538
Regardless of the punishment
I may receive…

32:39.749 --> 32:41.334
I will always stand

32:42.585 --> 32:44.003
with the powerless people.

33:19.497 --> 33:20.373
On-jo.

33:21.207 --> 33:22.083
Dad.

33:37.932 --> 33:38.975
Please help us.

33:43.646 --> 33:44.689
My wife and baby--

34:14.385 --> 34:15.928
I can't do it on my own.

34:16.012 --> 34:18.514
We need equipment
to cut through the frame.

34:20.391 --> 34:21.392
Please help us.

34:21.893 --> 34:22.894
I'm sorry.

34:24.103 --> 34:25.980
I need to get to my daughter.

34:26.898 --> 34:27.774
I'm so sorry.

34:28.566 --> 34:29.984
I'm begging you, sir.

34:32.153 --> 34:33.071
Our baby…

34:34.530 --> 34:38.451
Please, sir. Help us.

34:40.203 --> 34:43.372
They will begin sending rescuers soon.

34:43.456 --> 34:44.665
Hang on until then.

34:44.749 --> 34:46.834
Those monsters will come first.

35:01.516 --> 35:02.517
Here.

35:04.310 --> 35:05.978
Here. Take this.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.606
You have to hang on.

35:20.034 --> 35:21.035
You have to help me.

35:23.329 --> 35:24.247
Get back here now.

35:25.289 --> 35:26.249
Move.

35:28.251 --> 35:30.211
There is no more hope.

35:32.130 --> 35:35.591
It's like every sin became concentrated
and entered the human body.

35:36.092 --> 35:38.302
Even if we can conquer this virus,

35:38.928 --> 35:42.265
a world in which humanity rules
will never return.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.143
Can we believe people are beautiful

35:46.352 --> 35:49.105
after seeing them
turn into the absolute worst beings?

35:49.772 --> 35:50.606
If you shoot me,

35:51.607 --> 35:52.692
they'll come running.

35:53.276 --> 35:54.610
We'll die anyway.

35:56.279 --> 35:58.114
This way or that…

36:00.324 --> 36:01.784
My daughter is waiting for me.

36:06.998 --> 36:07.915
Please…

36:11.419 --> 36:12.795
Please don't go.

36:18.217 --> 36:19.844
Don't go.

36:22.180 --> 36:23.639
There was something we'd say

36:25.099 --> 36:28.436
whenever we hit a wall when I worked
at the pharmaceutical company.

36:29.854 --> 36:33.399
"Science begins with imagination
and ends as a mystery."

36:36.360 --> 36:38.362
I went to see a shaman on my way home.

36:47.163 --> 36:50.249
The shaman said
this will solve everything.

36:55.213 --> 36:58.007
Please help me. Help me!

36:58.883 --> 37:00.676
I'm human.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.929
I'm not a zombie!

37:07.308 --> 37:08.559
Crazy bastard!

37:15.274 --> 37:18.611
She tests both positive and negative
depending on when we test her.

37:19.403 --> 37:20.238
What does that mean?

37:20.321 --> 37:23.658
We have to assume
it's a fusion or evolution.

37:25.201 --> 37:26.202
Is it a mutation?

37:26.994 --> 37:28.079
Yes, that's correct.

37:29.121 --> 37:32.041
The virus is hiding
in the RNA of the cells.

37:32.124 --> 37:35.503
It's detected only when it manifests.
It can't be when it's dormant.

37:37.713 --> 37:41.384
That means tests can't tell us
whether or not they're infected.

37:42.134 --> 37:43.010
That's right.

37:43.094 --> 37:46.222
It's like the human
and the monster are fighting within.

37:48.975 --> 37:50.434
Is there a possibility

37:51.310 --> 37:53.104
that others from Hyosan are like her?

37:56.691 --> 37:58.567
As per KDCA's recommendation,

37:59.777 --> 38:00.861
it's best to presume

38:01.612 --> 38:03.864
they're infected
even if they show no symptoms.

38:13.541 --> 38:14.542
From this moment on,

38:15.459 --> 38:19.213
categorize everyone from Hyosan
as being infected but asymptomatic.

38:20.172 --> 38:24.093
Monitor those who were rescued later
separately and more closely.

38:26.887 --> 38:27.972
I know.

38:28.556 --> 38:30.725
You really are amazing.

38:33.311 --> 38:34.854
Using us in that situation.

38:36.522 --> 38:38.941
I would say she made good use of you.

38:39.984 --> 38:42.278
When it rains, you use the rain.

38:42.361 --> 38:46.073
When it's windy, you use the wind.
That's politics.

38:46.574 --> 38:50.119
You'll use that video
for your campaign later, won't you?

38:51.203 --> 38:54.623
Although you saved no one,
you'll get lots of votes

38:55.624 --> 38:56.834
as if you did something huge.

38:57.960 --> 38:59.295
She did do something huge.

38:59.879 --> 39:03.841
She got you out in exchange
for her taking full responsibility.

39:06.969 --> 39:09.472
She never told our captain to escape.

39:12.391 --> 39:13.976
Look here, U-sin.

39:15.353 --> 39:18.481
All disasters create heroes.

39:18.981 --> 39:20.858
Whether or not he saves his daughter,

39:20.941 --> 39:23.611
Mr. Nam So-ju will be a hero.

39:23.694 --> 39:27.114
That is what we're building right now.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.576
Don't you want your captain
to become a hero?

39:31.118 --> 39:33.662
-That's not it. I--
-Then we're good.

39:33.746 --> 39:36.040
Let's look at the big picture.

39:37.083 --> 39:39.877
From this moment on, we are one team.

39:40.753 --> 39:43.798
And we'll move forward together.

39:46.592 --> 39:47.635
What the hell?

39:47.718 --> 39:51.180
To prevent the spread of infection,
you'll be taken to a special quarantine.

39:51.263 --> 39:54.183
For safety reasons,
you'll be handcuffed during transport--

39:54.266 --> 39:55.309
Are we criminals?

39:55.976 --> 39:58.020
Why are you suddenly imprisoning us?

39:58.104 --> 40:01.315
How dare you try to put handcuffs
on the assembly member?

40:01.399 --> 40:02.566
Please comply.

40:05.820 --> 40:07.446
Don't test my patience.

40:07.530 --> 40:09.073
It's martial law.

40:09.156 --> 40:11.325
-Not a military dictatorship.
-Please comply.

40:11.409 --> 40:14.203
We can't follow rules that lack principle.

40:14.912 --> 40:18.416
Just kill me first
if you want to take her away.

40:19.041 --> 40:21.627
-What are you doing? Make a shield.
-Yes, sir.

40:21.710 --> 40:22.628
Hold on tight.

40:29.260 --> 40:30.261
Get in here.

40:42.106 --> 40:44.483
Attention, all citizens
in the quarantine camp.

40:44.567 --> 40:46.902
In order to find those who are infected
but are asymptomatic,

40:46.986 --> 40:50.239
we are separating Hyosan citizens
from those who came from elsewhere,

40:50.322 --> 40:53.701
as per the KDCA's recommendation.

40:54.869 --> 40:57.705
I'm fine.

40:58.330 --> 41:02.251
Until a trusted testing method is found
and the situation is resolved,

41:02.334 --> 41:07.631
stricter quarantine rules will be put
in place effective immediately.

41:07.715 --> 41:10.301
We apologize for the inconvenience,
and we hope you comply.

41:12.595 --> 41:14.889
You said we'd be treated like heroes.
What the hell is this?

41:14.972 --> 41:16.265
Quiet, you bastard.

41:17.057 --> 41:19.101
Did you find the laptop? What happened?

41:19.727 --> 41:21.103
Let's move.

41:23.105 --> 41:24.398
What about the laptop?

41:25.316 --> 41:27.067
You should at least tell us that!

41:40.331 --> 41:41.248
Are you okay?

41:42.124 --> 41:43.626
My ears hurt so much.

41:57.515 --> 41:58.474
Instead of earphones.

42:20.204 --> 42:21.080
It's raining.

42:23.207 --> 42:24.208
Hey, it's raining.

42:28.254 --> 42:29.838
It's fucking raining!

42:29.922 --> 42:31.340
Hey, it's raining!

43:02.037 --> 43:03.038
It's so refreshing.

43:30.733 --> 43:32.610
Fuck this. Seriously…

45:03.867 --> 45:04.702
Joon-yeong.

45:05.828 --> 45:08.122
You know how zombies follow us
if they hear us?

45:08.205 --> 45:11.125
If we move every time there's thunder,
maybe they won't hear us.

45:24.680 --> 45:26.265
No one is coming to rescue us.

45:28.851 --> 45:32.521
Isn't it better to die trying to get out
than die waiting here?

45:33.814 --> 45:35.691
Where can we go? And how?

45:35.774 --> 45:38.902
If we take the back door
of the auditorium to the tennis courts

45:39.737 --> 45:41.530
and go through the English center,

45:42.364 --> 45:43.991
we can reach the mountain.

46:06.180 --> 46:08.098
If we can reach the mountain,

46:08.182 --> 46:10.225
we can make it to Yangdong.

46:11.185 --> 46:13.437
I went hiking there
a few times with my dad.

46:15.898 --> 46:18.108
Don't you think it's too crazy to try?

46:18.776 --> 46:20.944
I'm not going. I'm scared.

46:22.154 --> 46:24.615
What if the zombies catch us?

46:24.698 --> 46:27.618
It's not like anyone will save us
if we stay here.

46:27.701 --> 46:30.078
We're the only ones
who can save ourselves.

46:38.378 --> 46:39.213
Let's go.

46:41.256 --> 46:42.966
If anything happens,

46:43.050 --> 46:45.886
I'll scream and lead the zombies away.

46:46.845 --> 46:48.472
If anything, I'll die alone.

46:49.598 --> 46:50.849
So let's go.

46:51.475 --> 46:52.476
Don't say that.

46:56.355 --> 46:57.773
We should all live.

46:59.733 --> 47:01.193
If anyone has to die,

47:02.736 --> 47:03.779
I'll die in their place.

47:04.363 --> 47:08.659
Because of the rain,
all scents are mixed together.

47:10.911 --> 47:12.496
The rain is really loud too.

47:15.749 --> 47:17.668
I'm sure the zombies' senses are dulled.

47:18.210 --> 47:20.754
If that's what a hambie says,
it should be reliable.

47:20.838 --> 47:22.297
What's a hambie?

47:22.381 --> 47:24.758
A half…

47:26.176 --> 47:27.719
reliable person.

47:29.304 --> 47:30.180
Should we go?

47:31.390 --> 47:33.058
And Prez is strong.

47:33.642 --> 47:34.643
Let's trust her and go.

47:35.310 --> 47:36.854
I'm not strong right now.

47:36.937 --> 47:37.771
Why not?

47:40.023 --> 47:41.275
I don't know.

47:45.904 --> 47:48.407
Some of us may not be able to keep up.

47:48.490 --> 47:51.368
We can't have anyone fall,
so let's pair up and hold hands.

47:51.451 --> 47:52.494
To protect each other.

47:55.330 --> 47:56.248
Hey.

48:13.307 --> 48:15.392
-Wu-jin. Let's go.
-Okay.

48:20.772 --> 48:21.648
Hey.

48:23.650 --> 48:24.902
Stay behind me.

48:29.114 --> 48:30.115
Let's survive first.

48:31.325 --> 48:32.534
We can talk about us later.

49:09.029 --> 49:10.447
-Careful.
-Okay.

49:12.115 --> 49:13.492
Don't let go of my hand.

49:23.377 --> 49:25.045
I get it.

49:42.896 --> 49:44.189
Damn it.

49:47.401 --> 49:49.403
-Damn it.
-What are you doing?

49:49.987 --> 49:50.988
My bad.

49:53.156 --> 49:54.992
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

49:55.075 --> 49:56.201
Move together with me.

50:00.789 --> 50:01.748
Be careful.

50:05.711 --> 50:06.586
Careful.

50:29.943 --> 50:31.611
-What's wrong?
-Hold on.

50:35.532 --> 50:36.575
Are they there?

50:50.338 --> 50:51.214
Let's go.

51:11.026 --> 51:11.902
Let's go.

51:22.204 --> 51:24.539
Hey. They're acting strange.

51:24.623 --> 51:26.249
Be quiet.

51:26.333 --> 51:27.918
Come here and look.

51:28.001 --> 51:29.753
They look like total morons.

51:29.836 --> 51:30.962
Hey.

51:32.214 --> 51:33.256
I'm freezing.

51:35.175 --> 51:36.093
It's the rain.

51:36.593 --> 51:37.886
Hey, let's go.

51:37.969 --> 51:39.554
It's our best chance to escape.

51:39.638 --> 51:42.307
Let's go behind that building
and go up the mountain.

52:28.186 --> 52:32.065
I'll lure that zombie and go that way.

52:32.149 --> 52:33.567
Use that time to get out.

52:34.568 --> 52:35.527
No.

52:36.361 --> 52:38.155
I'll lure that zombie and go…

52:41.908 --> 52:46.121
Let's just go along the wall
and cross over there.

53:11.271 --> 53:12.189
Duck down.

53:13.440 --> 53:15.150
Stay low.

53:20.947 --> 53:22.282
Go along the wall.

53:23.533 --> 53:24.868
Go along the wall over there.

53:24.951 --> 53:26.077
-Back there?
-What?

54:09.955 --> 54:11.623
Hey, I'll go first.

54:13.875 --> 54:14.834
This way.

54:26.471 --> 54:27.847
Cheong-san.

54:44.990 --> 54:45.824
Mom?

58:45.146 --> 58:47.482
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCATIONS, INSTITUTIONS,

58:47.565 --> 58:49.692
AND EVENTS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTIONAL.
