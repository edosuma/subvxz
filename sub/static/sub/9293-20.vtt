We-We're going t...

00:13.534 --> 00:14.467
(grunts)

00:14.534 --> 00:16.434
HAYES:
Get Medical right away!

00:16.501 --> 00:18.267
<i>LISA:
It is incontestable
Wayne Palmer</i>

00:18.334 --> 00:21.434
won't be able to continue his
duties as commander-in-chief.

00:21.501 --> 00:23.701
I have the fate of the western
world and the lives

00:23.767 --> 00:25.634
of millions of Americans
hanging in the balance,

00:25.701 --> 00:27.467
and I can't...

00:27.534 --> 00:30.601
stop thinking about you.

00:30.667 --> 00:34.267
Bill Buchanan had Fayed
in custody...

00:34.334 --> 00:37.200
and he let him go.

00:37.267 --> 00:41.400
Karen Hayes put it
in a blue file over at Homeland.

00:41.467 --> 00:43.300
Someone is going to have
to go down--

00:43.367 --> 00:45.367
the farther from the
president, the better.

00:45.434 --> 00:46.634
Are you asking me to resign?

00:46.701 --> 00:47.968
HAYES:
No, Bill.

00:48.033 --> 00:49.767
I have to fire you.

00:49.834 --> 00:51.601
You should work with Milo,
you know, get cozy.

00:51.667 --> 00:53.000
Don't be such a jealous jerk.

00:53.067 --> 00:55.267
Um, the day I'm jealous
is the day I kill myself.

00:55.334 --> 00:56.534
Is there anything else?

00:56.601 --> 00:58.667
How about don't arm
nuclear bombs

00:58.734 --> 01:00.267
for terrorists.

01:00.334 --> 01:02.267
Sorry.

01:02.334 --> 01:04.467
That's not how I feel.

01:04.534 --> 01:06.334
Yeah, it is.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.634
No, it's not-- it just slipped
out of my mouth.

01:08.701 --> 01:09.934
Morris!

01:10.000 --> 01:11.968
You shouldn't have
any trouble running CTU.

01:12.033 --> 01:14.200
I'm not the right
choice to take over.

01:14.267 --> 01:16.200
You are the right choice.

01:16.267 --> 01:18.667
Nothing will change
operationally.

01:18.734 --> 01:20.567
Your objective remains the same:

01:20.634 --> 01:21.968
bring in Jack Bauer

01:22.033 --> 01:24.334
before he can hand over
the component to the Chinese.

01:24.400 --> 01:26.400
Mr. Bauer.

01:26.467 --> 01:28.167
Let's do this.

01:28.234 --> 01:30.200
Audrey walks out of here alone.

01:30.267 --> 01:32.734
As soon as I see that she
gets down near the bridge,

01:32.801 --> 01:34.334
then I'll give you
the component.

01:34.400 --> 01:36.133
DOYLE:
All right, this is
going down now, Nadia.

01:36.200 --> 01:37.734
Jack is about to hand over
the component.

01:37.801 --> 01:39.901
NADIA:
Mike, don't let that happen.

01:47.701 --> 01:50.000
MAN:
Cheng and his men
have escaped from the hotel.

01:50.067 --> 01:51.667
They're in three black Hummers,
heading north.

01:51.734 --> 01:53.367
Agent Bauer,
get down!

01:53.434 --> 01:54.367
Weapon is down!

01:54.434 --> 01:55.400
Down on the ground
now!

01:55.467 --> 01:56.701
Who is your commanding officer?

01:56.767 --> 01:58.033
DOYLE:
I am, Jack.

01:58.100 --> 02:00.734
I got to take
you into custody.

02:00.801 --> 02:01.834
Where's the sub-circuit board?

02:01.901 --> 02:03.300
Cheng's got it.

02:03.367 --> 02:05.701
I was set to blow the building
and destroy the component

02:05.767 --> 02:07.667
until you engaged us
in a firefight.

02:07.734 --> 02:08.934
I had this handled.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Audrey, it's over.

02:10.067 --> 02:11.000
It's all right,
you're safe.

02:11.067 --> 02:12.133
Help me, Jack.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.501
Please don't let
them do this to me.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.267
Audrey!

02:15.334 --> 02:16.734
They've done something to her.

02:16.801 --> 02:18.067
You've got to help her, please.

02:19.634 --> 02:21.267
(inaudible)

02:21.334 --> 02:22.467
My God.

02:29.033 --> 02:33.033
(helicopter propeller whirring)

02:33.100 --> 02:35.501
Mr. Bauer, was this
the only C-4 that
was in the building?

02:35.567 --> 02:38.267
Yes, that's everything;
the building's clean.

02:38.334 --> 02:40.133

Advertise your product or brand here

02:51.334 --> 02:53.133
Ms. Raines,
my name is Mike Doyle.

02:53.200 --> 02:54.367
I'm a CTU field agent.

02:54.434 --> 02:56.234
We're hoping
you saw or heard something

02:56.300 --> 02:57.467
while Cheng was holding you...

02:57.534 --> 02:59.834
something that could
lead us to him.

03:06.133 --> 03:08.400
You're safe now,
Ms. Raines.

03:08.467 --> 03:09.934
Jack bought your freedom
from the Chinese

03:10.000 --> 03:11.434
with a component
that contains

03:11.501 --> 03:14.334
highly sensitive
Russian technology.

03:22.834 --> 03:25.434
Can you understand me,
Ms. Raines?

03:27.501 --> 03:28.934
Help me, Jack.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.167
Please don't let them
do this to me.

03:42.133 --> 03:45.300
I want CHP to work with military
on roadblocks.

03:45.367 --> 03:47.234
You need to set up three-
and five-mile perimeters

03:47.300 --> 03:49.133
from Cheng's
last confirmed location.

03:49.200 --> 03:51.767
I need satellite scans analyzed
and forwarded to me now.

03:51.834 --> 03:53.234
(over phone):
The system's overloaded.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.534
Yeah, I understand
the system's overloaded.

03:54.601 --> 03:55.534
Those are your orders.

03:55.601 --> 03:57.334
(knock at door)

03:59.400 --> 04:00.734
You wanted to see me?

04:00.801 --> 04:02.267
Yeah. Morris,
I read your request

04:02.334 --> 04:03.868
for a transfer out of Comm.

04:03.934 --> 04:05.067
Mm-hmm.

04:05.133 --> 04:06.534
Is this because you
and Chloe had a fight?

04:06.601 --> 04:08.534
Look, your facts
are essentially correct.

04:08.601 --> 04:11.167
The why I don't see as being
anybody's business.

04:11.234 --> 04:14.534
Look, Morris, you've had
a hard day-- we all have--

04:14.601 --> 04:16.901
but... I really need you
on the floor.

04:16.968 --> 04:19.466
So I'm sorry; your request
for a transfer is denied.

04:21.132 --> 04:24.567
(conversing indistinctly)

04:26.868 --> 04:29.167
You're new to the
job, and I'm just
trying to protect you

04:29.234 --> 04:30.367
from being caught
in the middle

04:30.434 --> 04:32.167
of a very awkward
professional situation.

04:32.234 --> 04:34.200
You're asking me
to indulge

04:34.267 --> 04:35.868
your private melodrama
while we're in the middle

04:35.934 --> 04:37.133
of an international crisis.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.667
Bill Buchanan said he'd
consider my request.

04:38.734 --> 04:39.834
Did he tell you that?

04:39.901 --> 04:42.667
Bill Buchanan
is not running CTU, I am.

04:42.734 --> 04:44.334
I've made my decision.
Nadia...

04:44.400 --> 04:46.534
Go back to your station, keep
your personal life to yourself.

04:46.601 --> 04:48.868
You can deal with this tomorrow.
Nadia...

04:48.934 --> 04:50.100
We're done here, Morris.

04:50.167 --> 04:51.701
(phone rings)

04:51.767 --> 04:53.167
Anything else you want to say?

04:53.234 --> 04:54.701
Oh, yeah.

04:57.067 --> 04:58.767
This is Nadia Yassir.

04:58.834 --> 05:00.767
Nadia, it's Mike.
Do you have a lead on Cheng?

05:00.834 --> 05:01.834
We're working on it.

05:01.901 --> 05:02.901
How did it go
with Audrey Raines?

05:02.968 --> 05:04.133
Not good.

05:04.200 --> 05:05.367
What, she doesn't know anything
about Cheng?

05:05.434 --> 05:06.701
Where he was holding her,
what he was doing?

05:06.767 --> 05:08.100
She's completely
nonresponsive.

05:08.167 --> 05:09.467
I'm not a shrink,

05:09.534 --> 05:11.067
but whatever they did
to her in China...

05:11.133 --> 05:13.534
it left her with some kind
of post-traumatic reaction.

05:13.601 --> 05:14.934
Bring her back here.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.634
District will want a specialist
to take a look at her.

05:16.701 --> 05:18.400
Do you have any idea
what Jack was thinking?

05:18.467 --> 05:19.901
Yeah. He had this
motel rigged with C-4.

05:19.968 --> 05:21.434
He was going to take
this whole place down

05:21.501 --> 05:23.000
as soon as Audrey was safe.

05:23.067 --> 05:25.200
He was willing to
sacrifice his life to
get Audrey released?

05:25.267 --> 05:27.834
And his plan would've worked
if I hadn't intervened.

05:27.901 --> 05:29.133
You saved his life.

05:29.200 --> 05:30.934
But I lost the component.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.634
Jack went against a direct order
from the White House.

05:33.701 --> 05:37.167
This was no one's fault
but his.

05:37.234 --> 05:39.234
We're on our way back.

05:42.767 --> 05:44.801
Stevenson, you take Ms. Raines.

05:44.868 --> 05:47.567
I'll go with Bauer.

05:47.634 --> 05:50.734
(helicopter propeller
whirring nearby)

05:54.167 --> 05:55.234
Audrey!

05:55.300 --> 05:56.834
Audrey!

05:58.100 --> 05:59.834
Audrey!
DOYLE:
Jack, stop.

05:59.901 --> 06:02.100
Where are you taking her?
To CTU, Jack, the same
place you're going.

06:02.167 --> 06:04.300
Let me talk to her, just
for a couple of minutes, please.

06:04.367 --> 06:06.200
You saw what condition
she's in, Jack.

06:06.267 --> 06:07.334
I know her.

06:07.400 --> 06:08.801
I know what she's been through.

06:08.868 --> 06:11.234
I might be the only person
that can get through to her.

06:11.300 --> 06:12.267
Please.

06:12.334 --> 06:14.067
You're under arrest, Jack.

06:14.133 --> 06:16.033
We'll discuss this back at CTU.

06:16.100 --> 06:17.334
Put him in the
second chopper.

06:17.400 --> 06:20.300
Mike! Let me talk to her now.

06:38.834 --> 06:40.400
HAYES:
CTU is pouring
all their resources

06:40.467 --> 06:42.334
into finding Cheng,
and this executive order

06:42.400 --> 06:43.801
gives them authority to close

06:43.868 --> 06:45.300
all ports and
border crossings.

06:45.367 --> 06:46.634
We can't keep migrant workers

06:46.701 --> 06:48.100
from crossing our borders
at will.

06:48.167 --> 06:50.567
How the hell are we supposed to
stop a determined enemy agent?

06:50.634 --> 06:53.367
Well, I think the point
is to slow him down, sir,

06:53.434 --> 06:55.367
so that CTU
has more time to find him,

06:55.434 --> 06:57.000
but I agree, Cheng
will find a way

06:57.067 --> 06:58.567
to smuggle out the
Russian component

06:58.634 --> 06:59.567
eventually.

06:59.634 --> 07:01.334
So then Russia loses

07:01.400 --> 07:03.834
its defensive edge against the
Chinese and Moscow blames us.

07:03.901 --> 07:06.834
We will do everything in
our power to prevent that, sir.

07:06.901 --> 07:09.000
(sighs)

07:09.067 --> 07:10.000
(slams book)

07:10.067 --> 07:11.567
Thank you.

07:11.634 --> 07:13.234
Karen...

07:13.300 --> 07:14.734
Yes.

07:14.801 --> 07:16.701
Tom told me
about you and Bill,

07:16.767 --> 07:18.534
how you had to...
fire him from CTU.

07:18.601 --> 07:20.667
How did he take it?

07:20.734 --> 07:23.000
Not well.

07:24.067 --> 07:25.901
Karen.

07:25.968 --> 07:28.067
Yes.

07:29.434 --> 07:32.367
You and I have had our...

07:32.434 --> 07:35.100
difficulties in the past,
but I want you to know that...

07:36.167 --> 07:39.234
I value your role here

07:39.300 --> 07:42.434
and that I appreciate
your sacrifice.

07:45.133 --> 07:47.100
Thank you.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.100
(knock at door)

07:49.167 --> 07:50.834
Excuse me, sir.

07:50.901 --> 07:51.901
What is it, Tom?

07:51.968 --> 07:52.934
Russian President's
calling for you

07:53.000 --> 07:54.100
in the telepresence suite.

07:54.167 --> 07:56.200
He insisting on a face-to-face,

07:56.267 --> 07:58.234
Did he say what he wants?

07:58.300 --> 07:59.667
No, but he's on with the heads

07:59.734 --> 08:00.968
of military
and intelligence services.

08:02.234 --> 08:04.734
I want both of you
with me on this.

08:23.968 --> 08:25.601
(gasps)

08:32.234 --> 08:34.133
Palmer's still
in a coma.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.467
Looks like Noah's going to be
acting president for some time.

08:36.534 --> 08:38.967
Good for Noah.

08:39.033 --> 08:40.501
And good for us.

08:40.567 --> 08:42.634
The only thing he cares about

08:42.701 --> 08:45.067
is pushing
his lunatic foreign agenda.

08:45.133 --> 08:47.868
Any pending legislation
on spending...

08:47.934 --> 08:50.667
you'll defer to me.

08:50.734 --> 08:51.901
Now that he is
acting president,

08:51.968 --> 08:53.067
we're going to have to
be even more careful

08:53.133 --> 08:54.734
We will be.

08:54.801 --> 08:56.434
I've got half an hour.

08:56.501 --> 08:58.601
Let's stop talking.

09:16.501 --> 09:17.801
President Suvarov,

09:17.868 --> 09:19.834
you're on a secure conference

09:19.901 --> 09:21.100
with Vice President Daniels.

09:21.167 --> 09:22.534
President Suvarov.

09:22.601 --> 09:24.367
Mr. Vice President.

09:24.434 --> 09:27.167
You know my Chief of Staff,
Tom Lennox, and Karen Hayes,

09:27.234 --> 09:28.534
my National
Security Advisor.

09:28.601 --> 09:30.200
How can we help you?

09:30.267 --> 09:33.267
Some very troubling news has
been brought to my attention.

09:33.334 --> 09:34.934
What would that be?

09:35.033 --> 09:37.667
The nuclear weapons
that fell into terrorists' hands

09:37.734 --> 09:39.868
contained proprietary
Russian technology

09:39.934 --> 09:41.467
that up until now

09:41.534 --> 09:44.200
has only been available
to your government and mine.

09:44.267 --> 09:45.834
I'm well aware of that, sir.

09:45.901 --> 09:47.167
Then you are also

09:47.234 --> 09:49.434
"well aware"
that an FB-sub-circuit board

09:49.501 --> 09:50.901
from one of the weapons

09:50.968 --> 09:55.834
is now in the possession of an
agent of the Chinese government.

09:57.234 --> 09:59.667
Do you deny that, sir?

10:01.734 --> 10:02.901
Mr. President,

10:02.968 --> 10:05.834
all I'm prepared
to tell you is that...

10:05.901 --> 10:08.200
we're in control
of the situation.

10:08.267 --> 10:12.367
Mr. Vice President,
my generals have confirmed

10:12.434 --> 10:15.567
that this component contains
information that will compromise

10:15.634 --> 10:17.534
our defensive capabilities.

10:17.601 --> 10:21.501
You must stop the Chinese from
leaving your country with it.

10:21.567 --> 10:25.234
I don't appreciate being
dictated to, Mr. President.

10:25.300 --> 10:27.667
Now, I don't need
to remind you

10:27.734 --> 10:29.968
that it was a Russian general
who allowed those bombs

10:30.033 --> 10:31.834
to enter the U.S.
in the first place,

10:31.901 --> 10:35.501
the same Russian general
who conspired to detonate them.

10:35.567 --> 10:39.000
That does not change
our grave concerns

10:39.067 --> 10:40.701
about this development.

10:40.767 --> 10:42.934
If you do not intercept
this component,

10:43.000 --> 10:46.033
my generals have instructions

10:46.100 --> 10:48.901
to initiate
an appropriate response.

10:48.968 --> 10:50.033
Mr. President...

10:50.100 --> 10:51.200
Good night, sir.

10:52.834 --> 10:55.334
How the hell did the Russians
find out about this?!

10:55.400 --> 10:56.434
Russian intelligence

10:56.501 --> 10:58.033
must have been tracking it.

10:58.100 --> 10:59.968
No, no, no, the information
circle is too tight.

11:00.033 --> 11:02.434
Only select people
at the White House

11:02.501 --> 11:04.567
and CTU even knew about this.

11:05.801 --> 11:07.501
So you're saying there's a spy?

11:07.567 --> 11:09.200
There is no other explanation.

11:09.267 --> 11:10.868
I will start an immediate
internal investigation

11:10.934 --> 11:12.501
into the White House staff.

11:12.567 --> 11:14.567
I'll do the same
at CTU, sir.

11:15.701 --> 11:17.734
What are your reads on Suvarov?

11:19.033 --> 11:21.067
How seriously do
we take his threat?

11:21.133 --> 11:22.300
Oh, I would say very, sir.

11:22.367 --> 11:23.767
With the Chinese in possession

11:23.834 --> 11:25.534
of the component,
the Russians will
need to extend

11:25.601 --> 11:28.067
their defensive line
in Central Asia.

11:28.133 --> 11:29.968
We have a military base
in the region.

11:30.033 --> 11:31.434
Which the Russians
will have to target.

11:31.501 --> 11:32.701
We will have to
respond in kind...

11:32.767 --> 11:33.868
Which will escalate things

11:33.934 --> 11:36.067
beyond just a regional conflict.

11:41.367 --> 11:44.400
Give CTU whatever they need

11:44.467 --> 11:46.000
to find this man Cheng.

11:51.367 --> 11:52.601
(speaking Chinese)

11:55.000 --> 11:56.968
(speaking Chinese)

12:09.067 --> 12:10.701
OPERATIVE:
Yes?

12:10.767 --> 12:12.167
I've interfaced the component.

12:12.234 --> 12:14.100
You should have the schematics.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.901
Yes, they've downloaded.

12:15.968 --> 12:18.534
I'm running a diagnostic
on the component now.

12:18.601 --> 12:21.033
Good. We'll be there
in less than an hour.

12:21.100 --> 12:23.200
Wait.

12:23.267 --> 12:24.767
(typing)

12:24.834 --> 12:26.033
(sighs):
There's a problem.

12:26.100 --> 12:27.100
What?

12:27.167 --> 12:28.868
The circuit board is damaged.

12:28.934 --> 12:29.968
Can you fix it?

12:30.033 --> 12:31.000
No, not unless I have

12:31.067 --> 12:32.534
The security override.

12:32.601 --> 12:34.701
We don't have access
to that information.

12:34.767 --> 12:37.267
Without it, this technology's
useless to us!

12:37.334 --> 12:40.701
We'll have to find someone
who has the necessary expertise.

12:56.888 --> 12:59.154
--LITTLE
I'm gonna take a quick shower.

12:59.220 --> 13:01.487
Noah's waiting for me
to get back.

13:18.987 --> 13:20.953
(shower running)

13:50.220 --> 13:52.154
* *

13:56.421 --> 13:58.554
(cell phone ringing)

13:58.621 --> 13:59.587
Yes?

13:59.654 --> 14:01.020
We're all set.

14:01.087 --> 14:03.454
And the girl doesn't know
you're working for us?

14:03.521 --> 14:04.854
Not a clue.

14:04.920 --> 14:06.687
Good.

14:11.154 --> 14:12.154
Morris.

14:12.220 --> 14:13.287
Yeah?

14:13.354 --> 14:16.387
I saw you arguing with Nadia.

14:16.454 --> 14:18.421
Yeah.

14:21.020 --> 14:21.953
Was it about us?

14:23.821 --> 14:26.053
I asked for a transfer.

14:26.120 --> 14:27.421
It was denied.

14:30.487 --> 14:31.920
Why did you do that?

14:31.987 --> 14:35.421
Because working with you

14:35.487 --> 14:38.087
is becoming very uncomfortable.

14:41.687 --> 14:43.587
I told you I was sorry.

14:45.020 --> 14:47.621
You said I should stop
helping terrorists

14:47.687 --> 14:50.387
arm nuclear bombs.

14:52.254 --> 14:55.254
We've both said things
that we haven't mean before.

14:57.687 --> 14:58.821
Yeah, I know.

14:58.888 --> 15:01.587
But...

15:01.654 --> 15:04.587
there's a line,
darling, and...

15:04.654 --> 15:05.788
and you crossed it.

15:07.854 --> 15:10.254
So what are you saying?

15:11.320 --> 15:14.521
I'm saying that...

15:14.587 --> 15:15.821
it's over.

15:19.220 --> 15:20.721
There's no going back.

15:20.788 --> 15:22.020
We're done.

15:27.554 --> 15:28.587
Morris.

15:28.654 --> 15:30.788
Look at me.

15:32.754 --> 15:35.087
You don't have to do this.

15:41.920 --> 15:42.987
We're done.

15:50.287 --> 15:52.987
But, Morris...

16:00.187 --> 16:01.154
(sniffles)

16:03.087 --> 16:05.053
(sobbing quietly)

16:07.654 --> 16:11.087
Nadia, the situation
has escalated with the Russians.

16:11.154 --> 16:12.521
They know the Chinese
have the component,

16:12.587 --> 16:15.087
and they're threatening
military action

16:15.154 --> 16:17.354
unless we stop them from
taking it out of the country.

16:17.421 --> 16:18.554
How did the
Russians find out?

16:18.621 --> 16:19.587
A leak.

16:19.654 --> 16:21.487
Tom Lennox is
looking into it here,

16:21.554 --> 16:23.821
and he wants you to start
an investigation there.

16:23.888 --> 16:25.320
I'll let Internal
Affairs know right away.

16:25.387 --> 16:27.187
Now, what about
Audrey Raines?

16:27.254 --> 16:29.554
Has she provided any information
that will lead us to Cheng?

16:29.621 --> 16:30.953
Not yet,
but the psychiatric specialist

16:31.020 --> 16:32.087
from District has just arrived.

16:32.154 --> 16:34.454
So we're hoping he
can get her to talk.

16:34.521 --> 16:36.421
Do you have any other leads?

16:36.487 --> 16:38.053
Not at the moment.

16:38.120 --> 16:40.120
That's unfortunate.

16:40.187 --> 16:41.687
I cannot emphasize enough

16:41.754 --> 16:44.920
how important it is
that we stop Cheng.

16:44.987 --> 16:48.120
If you need more resources,
you need to let me know now.

16:48.187 --> 16:50.154
Do you understand?

16:52.687 --> 16:54.987
I will.

16:55.053 --> 16:57.020
One more thing.

16:59.087 --> 17:01.120
To be honest, Karen,
what we need is Bill Buchanan.

17:01.187 --> 17:04.487
But there's a rumor
flying around you fired him.

17:04.554 --> 17:06.287
Well, that's complicated, Nadia.

17:06.354 --> 17:08.487
Not as far as
we're concerned.

17:08.554 --> 17:11.087
You know more than anyone
how good he is at this job.

17:11.154 --> 17:12.854
I don't see how something
like this could happen

17:12.920 --> 17:14.454
when we're in
the middle of a crisis.

17:14.521 --> 17:17.387
Look, I'm not at liberty
to discuss this.

17:17.454 --> 17:20.721
Just keep me updated with
your progress on finding Cheng.

17:22.854 --> 17:26.488
Dr. Bradley. I'm Nadia Yassir,
acting head of CTU.

17:26.554 --> 17:29.020
We're under a time crunch now,
so I'd like to get started

17:29.087 --> 17:31.254
with Ms. Raines
immediately.
She's being prepped in medical.

17:31.321 --> 17:32.987
These men can take you there.
I'll join you shortly.

17:33.054 --> 17:35.187
Thank you.
I want to hear your first
impressions as soon as possible.

17:35.254 --> 17:37.254
Of course.

17:37.321 --> 17:39.787
Nadia, Doyle and Jack
just landed.

17:39.854 --> 17:40.920
Okay, have Doyle secure Bauer,

17:40.987 --> 17:42.454
and then have him
meet me in medical.

17:44.488 --> 17:46.521
Okay.

17:49.387 --> 17:50.554
Can you leave us alone, please?

17:50.620 --> 17:53.354
Thank you.

17:53.421 --> 17:54.887
Ms. Raines.

17:56.687 --> 17:59.354
Ms. Raines, I'm Dr. Bradley.

17:59.421 --> 18:02.254
I'm here to perform a medical
evaluation to help you remember

18:02.321 --> 18:04.521
whatever you can
about this man Cheng--

18:04.588 --> 18:06.154
where you were held,
what you heard.

18:06.221 --> 18:07.421
It's all right.

18:07.488 --> 18:09.020
It's okay.

18:21.254 --> 18:22.820
Come here. Look at this.

18:25.687 --> 18:28.787
Please, you've got
to let me talk to her.

18:28.854 --> 18:30.288
You know CTU's protocol.

18:30.354 --> 18:32.021
You know how they're
gonna interrogate her.

18:32.087 --> 18:34.487
They're gonna make her retreat
farther inside herself.

18:34.553 --> 18:36.054
Please,
listen to me!

18:40.787 --> 18:43.154
Sit down.

18:43.221 --> 18:45.720
This will make it
more comfortable.

18:47.754 --> 18:48.754
Mike.

18:48.820 --> 18:51.487
Please, I'm
begging you.

18:51.553 --> 18:54.687
Take care of her.

19:11.954 --> 19:13.854
Jack's in
holding three.

19:13.921 --> 19:15.087
How you doing?

19:15.154 --> 19:17.388
White House is pressuring us
to find Cheng.

19:17.453 --> 19:18.654
We have to hope

19:18.720 --> 19:21.054
he can get some information
out of her.

19:22.054 --> 19:24.021
(knocking)

19:27.687 --> 19:30.553
Dr. Bradley,
this is Agent Doyle.

19:30.620 --> 19:32.420
He was involved in
rescuing Ms. Raines.

19:32.487 --> 19:33.453
Do you have a diagnosis?

19:33.520 --> 19:34.887
My preliminary
is she's

19:34.954 --> 19:37.654
a type three catatonic, capable
of following simple commands

19:37.720 --> 19:39.520
and repeating words and basic
phrases, but otherwise,

19:39.587 --> 19:40.520
utterly unresponsive.

19:40.587 --> 19:41.720
Do you think
that you'll be able

19:41.787 --> 19:43.354
to get the information
we need from her?

19:43.420 --> 19:44.720
Within your timeframe?
Not without intervention.

19:44.787 --> 19:46.820
What does that mean?

19:46.887 --> 19:48.887
Ms. Raines is suffering from
severe psychological abuse,

19:48.954 --> 19:51.654
amplified by pharmacological
agents, as evidenced by

19:51.720 --> 19:54.820
more than 100 injection sites
on her arms, feet and groin.

19:54.887 --> 19:56.021
It's gonna be next to
impossible to communicate

19:56.087 --> 19:57.354
with her in
the near term unless

19:57.420 --> 19:59.054
we essentially attempt
to shock her out of this state.

19:59.121 --> 20:00.553
So they used drugs
to torture her,

20:00.620 --> 20:02.221
and you're gonna give her more?

20:02.288 --> 20:04.487
These are different compounds,
sir, used for different reasons.

20:04.553 --> 20:05.654
What are the risks?

20:05.720 --> 20:06.854
22 percent of patients

20:06.921 --> 20:08.354
experience
cardiovascular events,

20:08.420 --> 20:09.954
some of it
neurological.

20:10.021 --> 20:11.687
In the most extreme
cases, death can occur.

20:11.754 --> 20:13.087
We can't do this.
No, Doyle.

20:13.154 --> 20:14.388
I am not
comfortable with

20:14.453 --> 20:16.321
the high percentage
of adverse reactions either.

20:16.388 --> 20:18.054
But this treatment
is the only way

20:18.121 --> 20:20.254
you're gonna get anything
out of her in the time you have.

20:20.321 --> 20:21.420
Maybe not. One of our agents,

20:21.487 --> 20:22.754
Jack Bauer, has a long
history with her,

20:22.820 --> 20:24.887
and the Chinese put him
through something similar.

20:24.954 --> 20:26.487
Listen, it makes sense
to see what Jack

20:26.553 --> 20:28.288
can draw from her before
we do anything riskier.

20:28.354 --> 20:30.054
Doctor?

20:30.121 --> 20:31.787
Yeah, I know who Jack Bauer is.

20:31.854 --> 20:33.887
I read Ms. Raines' file
on the way over.

20:33.954 --> 20:36.121
And in my opinion, contact
with him will more likely

20:36.187 --> 20:37.453
upset her than
encourage her to talk.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.288
But there's no chance
of her dying from it.

20:39.354 --> 20:41.121
Let's give Jack
a chance with her.

20:41.187 --> 20:43.620
With all due respect,
it's not your call, Ms. Yassir.

20:43.687 --> 20:45.954
District has formally placed
Ms. Raines in my custody

20:46.021 --> 20:47.754
and granted me the authority to
determine appropriate treatment.

20:47.820 --> 20:50.121
I'm gonna begin preparing
for her treatment shortly.

20:50.187 --> 20:51.754
I'll let you know
what the results are.

20:51.820 --> 20:52.987
Good day.

20:53.022 --> 20:54.886
You can't let him do this,

20:54.952 --> 20:56.516
not without even
giving Jack a...
He has jurisdiction.

20:56.583 --> 20:58.149
The hell with
jurisdiction!
There's nothing I can do.

20:58.215 --> 21:00.180
You can do
what you know is right.

21:02.710 --> 21:04.208
That's what Buchanan
would have done.

21:04.275 --> 21:06.006
And that was uncalled for.

21:06.073 --> 21:07.503
Well, I'm sorry.

21:07.570 --> 21:09.869
What I meant to say is,
since you're acting director,

21:09.935 --> 21:12.333
you can't be afraid
to step on toes.

21:12.398 --> 21:14.130
Does that go
down better?

21:14.197 --> 21:15.628
And part of being
acting director

21:15.695 --> 21:17.526
is respecting
the chain of command.

21:19.258 --> 21:21.654
But thank you for your advice.

21:41.163 --> 21:42.296
--It's him.

21:44.361 --> 21:46.258
(ringing continues)

21:46.324 --> 21:47.891
Hi.

21:47.956 --> 21:49.687
Where are you?

21:49.754 --> 21:51.852
I'm... on my way out the door.

21:51.919 --> 21:53.550
Well, get here as
quickly as you can.

21:53.617 --> 21:55.281
There's a crisis.

21:55.348 --> 21:56.679
Has there been
another threat?

21:56.746 --> 21:58.577
Yes, but not from
the terrorists.

21:58.644 --> 22:00.208
I'll fill you in
when you get here.

22:00.275 --> 22:01.807
I'll be there
in less than 15.

22:01.874 --> 22:03.838
Lisa...

22:03.905 --> 22:06.435
I need you.

22:06.501 --> 22:09.464
I need you, too.

22:14.091 --> 22:16.356
I have to go.

22:16.423 --> 22:17.521
What's going on?

22:17.588 --> 22:19.819
I don't know.

22:46.953 --> 22:48.552
Yes.

22:48.618 --> 22:49.716
It's me.

22:49.783 --> 22:50.948
What's my next move?

22:53.279 --> 22:55.243
Thank you.
Yes.

22:58.306 --> 23:00.271
I think I've identified
the leak, sir.

23:00.337 --> 23:02.535
Is it here or at CTU?

23:02.601 --> 23:04.366
Oh, it's very much here, sir.

23:04.433 --> 23:06.863
I had NSA run
a data sort

23:06.929 --> 23:09.126
on all White House phone calls
and e-mails

23:09.193 --> 23:11.425
over the last two
and half hours.

23:11.491 --> 23:12.723
That's when we found out

23:12.790 --> 23:14.919
the sub-circuit board was
in play.

23:14.986 --> 23:16.285
And?

23:16.352 --> 23:18.049
During the same time frame,

23:18.116 --> 23:20.846
one of our staffers called
a lobbyist,

23:20.912 --> 23:23.043
Mark Bishop, three times.

23:23.110 --> 23:26.540
Now, CIA had flagged
this Bishop two years ago

23:26.607 --> 23:28.804
as having
"possible to likely contact

23:28.871 --> 23:30.135
with Russian Intelligee
agents."

23:30.201 --> 23:33.031
No further investigation
was done

23:33.098 --> 23:35.529
due to lack of resources.

23:36.762 --> 23:38.725
Which staffer are we talking

23:38.792 --> 23:40.190
about here, Tom?

23:40.256 --> 23:42.054
Lisa Miller, sir.

23:50.578 --> 23:51.876
(scoffs)

23:51.943 --> 23:53.508
I find it hard to believe

23:53.575 --> 23:55.739
my Chief Aide is working
for the Russians.

23:55.805 --> 23:58.001
I don't think she did
so knowingly, sir.

23:58.068 --> 23:59.999
She wouldn't have called Bishop
from her phone.

24:00.066 --> 24:03.196
Then I... I don't understand--

24:03.262 --> 24:05.194
how is this man getting
information from her?

24:05.260 --> 24:06.759
Well, so far...

24:06.826 --> 24:08.889
we have found
credit card records

24:08.956 --> 24:13.018
that show Ms. Miller and Bishop
staying at the same hotels,

24:13.085 --> 24:14.383
on the same nights,

24:14.450 --> 24:15.847
several times
over the past year.

24:15.914 --> 24:17.713
Now, I think if we dig
a little deeper,

24:17.779 --> 24:20.743
I'm sure that we will
find more evidence

24:20.809 --> 24:22.839
that shows these two were
sleeping together.

24:26.135 --> 24:28.865
Then we have a bigger problem
than you think, Tom.

24:28.932 --> 24:30.464
Why is that, sir?

24:32.529 --> 24:35.291
Because I'm sleeping
with her, too.

24:42.383 --> 24:44.348
She...

24:45.413 --> 24:47.511
She started working
for me

24:47.577 --> 24:49.541
two years after my wife...

24:53.203 --> 24:54.702
After Nancy

24:54.769 --> 24:57.499
died, it...

24:57.565 --> 24:59.563
At that time I didn't think
I'd ever feel anything

24:59.630 --> 25:01.194
for another woman again,
but...

25:01.261 --> 25:03.625
Lisa and I
became close,

25:03.692 --> 25:05.722
then last year...

25:05.788 --> 25:08.719
we were working
late one night, and...

25:12.181 --> 25:14.612
Well, you understand
how these things happen, Tom.

25:18.574 --> 25:19.839
Damn it.

25:19.905 --> 25:22.768
What a fool I've been.

25:26.231 --> 25:28.828
What the hell do I do, Tom?

25:30.892 --> 25:34.288
You know, actually, sir,

25:34.355 --> 25:37.452
handled correctly,

25:37.518 --> 25:42.446
we may be able to turn this
situation to our advantage.

25:52.634 --> 25:54.298
Mike, what's
happening out there?

25:54.365 --> 25:57.328
Will they let me
speak to Audrey?
I tried to make
it happen, Jack,

25:57.394 --> 25:59.359
but they're
not going for it.
Why not?

25:59.426 --> 26:00.524
'Cause the shrink
who's treating her--

26:00.591 --> 26:01.623
he doesn't think
it's a good idea.

26:01.690 --> 26:03.621
Let me talk to him.
I wish

26:03.688 --> 26:04.885
this guy was interested

26:04.952 --> 26:06.450
in what other people had
to say, but he isn't.

26:06.517 --> 26:08.215
Why?

26:10.279 --> 26:11.777
He's got her
in medical, Jack,

26:11.843 --> 26:14.107
and he's about to try
some protocol of his own

26:14.174 --> 26:16.105
using big doses of drugs.

26:16.172 --> 26:18.702
It could kill her, Jack.

26:18.769 --> 26:21.033
Why did you uncuff me?

26:21.099 --> 26:24.795
'Cause I think you need
to do something about it.

26:26.427 --> 26:28.658
Make it look good.

26:38.912 --> 26:41.442
Easy.

26:43.906 --> 26:45.870
(grunts)

27:03.049 --> 27:05.846
(grunts)

27:11.241 --> 27:12.339
Vitals are strong.

27:12.405 --> 27:13.505
I think she's ready.
Good.

27:13.571 --> 27:14.703
Get her IV started.

27:21.660 --> 27:24.624
Excuse me, sir,
you can't be in here.

27:25.723 --> 27:27.322
Have you started
yet?
No.

27:27.388 --> 27:28.553
What have you done to her?!

27:28.619 --> 27:29.718
Nothing. Nothing.

27:29.785 --> 27:31.982
Consider yourself

27:32.049 --> 27:33.215
lucky.

27:33.281 --> 27:35.245
You're Jack Bauer,
I recognize you

27:35.312 --> 27:37.143
from her file.
You shouldn't be here.

27:37.210 --> 27:38.874
Seeing you will only
make things worse.

27:38.941 --> 27:39.873
Shut up!

27:39.940 --> 27:41.538
(breathing heavily)

27:41.604 --> 27:42.869
Audrey, I need you
to come with me.

27:42.936 --> 27:44.135
I need you to come
with me now.

27:44.202 --> 27:46.165
Please, come on.

27:50.527 --> 27:52.358
(alarm blaring)

27:52.425 --> 27:54.556
Just get me anything you can.

27:54.621 --> 27:56.387
(blaring continues)

27:56.454 --> 27:58.051
Milo, what's the location
of that alarm?

27:58.118 --> 27:59.715
Clinic, Nadia,
exam room six,

27:59.782 --> 28:00.881
where Audrey's
being treated.

28:00.948 --> 28:02.081
Get me video feed.

28:06.841 --> 28:07.840
She's gone.
Lock everything down.

28:07.907 --> 28:09.105
Get me holding room three!

28:10.569 --> 28:11.800
If we just let Jack talk
to Audrey,

28:11.801 --> 28:13.120
none of this would
have happened.

28:30.407 --> 28:31.639
--Okay, thank you.

28:31.706 --> 28:33.070
Security's confirmed
that jack didn't pass

28:33.137 --> 28:34.435
through any of the exits
before the lockdown.

28:34.502 --> 28:35.468
He's still here
somewhere.

28:35.534 --> 28:36.899
No one left sectors
A through K

28:36.965 --> 28:38.031
they're clear.
All right,

28:38.098 --> 28:39.596
so he's got to be on
the lower levels.

28:39.663 --> 28:41.160
Have you checked
those video feeds?
Yes.

28:41.227 --> 28:43.325
That's what I'm doing,
just takes a little bit of time.

28:43.392 --> 28:44.790
I know, make it
take less time.

28:46.822 --> 28:48.353
Where's Chloe?

28:48.419 --> 28:50.616
Morris?

28:50.683 --> 28:51.948
I don't... I'm not sure.

28:55.378 --> 28:56.344
Doyle.

28:56.409 --> 28:58.407
Have you found Jack?
No, not yet.

28:58.474 --> 29:00.238
But I'd like to know how
he managed to overpower you?

29:00.305 --> 29:02.769
I made a mistake,
I got too close.

29:02.835 --> 29:04.734
Yeah, see, I don't think
it was a mistake.

29:04.801 --> 29:06.930
You made it very clear
that you wanted

29:06.997 --> 29:08.228
Jack to have a chance
with Audrey.

29:08.295 --> 29:09.461
So, I think you went there

29:09.528 --> 29:11.625
with the express purpose
of letting him overpower you

29:11.692 --> 29:13.589
and then escaping
with your keycard.

29:13.656 --> 29:17.118
I did what I think
is best for this operation

29:17.185 --> 29:18.784
and for Audrey Raines.

29:21.780 --> 29:23.312
I have him!

29:23.378 --> 29:25.043
He's headed down
to the lower level.

29:25.108 --> 29:26.107
But with everything locked down

29:26.174 --> 29:27.972
he's only going to have access

29:28.039 --> 29:29.238
to corridors L and M.

29:29.304 --> 29:30.503
Okay, I'm on my way.

29:30.569 --> 29:32.134
Let me know
if you find anything else.

29:32.200 --> 29:34.232
And have Dr. Bradley
and Doyle meet me there.

29:37.395 --> 29:38.660
Hold on.

29:38.726 --> 29:41.256
Come on.

29:57.803 --> 29:59.735
(beeping)
(grunting)

30:05.095 --> 30:07.026
It's all right.

30:07.093 --> 30:08.591
It's all right, I'm here.

30:08.658 --> 30:09.922
I'm here.

30:09.989 --> 30:11.853
I'm not going anywhere.

30:11.920 --> 30:13.619
I'm going
to protect you.

30:13.685 --> 30:15.049
I'm going
to take care of you.

30:15.116 --> 30:17.181
I promise.

30:17.248 --> 30:19.144
I know you can recognize me.

30:19.211 --> 30:20.677
I see it in your eyes.

30:20.743 --> 30:23.506
It's me, Jack.

30:23.573 --> 30:25.071
The men who hurt you,

30:25.137 --> 30:26.604
they can't touch you now.

30:26.670 --> 30:28.168
I won't allow it.

30:28.235 --> 30:31.364
Right now, I need you
to try and remember.

30:31.431 --> 30:33.794
I need you to remember
who you are.

30:33.860 --> 30:37.090
Your name is
Audrey Raines.

30:37.157 --> 30:40.486
You were born Audrey Louise
Heller in Albany, New York.

30:40.553 --> 30:44.582
Your father was the Secretary
of Defense, James Heller.

30:44.648 --> 30:46.879
Your mother's name
was Alicia.

30:46.946 --> 30:49.343
She died
when you were nine.

30:50.707 --> 30:54.337
Please, Audrey,
just try and remember.

30:54.404 --> 30:55.436
(computer beeps)

30:55.502 --> 30:56.833
Nadia, I've got Jack.

30:56.900 --> 30:58.332
Room 237 was just sealed

30:58.399 --> 30:59.531
from the inside.

30:59.598 --> 31:00.929
They have to be in there.

31:00.995 --> 31:02.227
I see the room now.

31:05.024 --> 31:07.055
Damn it. It's disabled.

31:07.508 --> 31:09.143
Get an entry team
down here now.

31:09.209 --> 31:10.978
Need an entry team
at door 237.

31:11.045 --> 31:12.646
The men
that were holding you,

31:12.713 --> 31:13.914
when they called me

31:13.981 --> 31:15.716
there were within an hour
of my motel.

31:15.783 --> 31:17.751
When they moved you,

31:17.818 --> 31:20.487
can you remember if,
if you took surface streets

31:20.554 --> 31:23.188
or the freeway, anything
that can help us find them?

31:24.857 --> 31:27.827
I want them to pay
for what they've done.

31:42.641 --> 31:45.611
I know
what you've been through.

31:48.747 --> 31:50.582
I know what it's like
to feel

31:50.649 --> 31:52.583
like it's never going
to end...

31:52.650 --> 31:55.086
to hate them that much,

31:55.151 --> 31:58.656
and then need them...

31:58.723 --> 32:01.058
to start blaming
yourself

32:01.124 --> 32:03.060
for everything
that's happening to you.

32:04.294 --> 32:07.664
But they can't hurt you
anymore.

32:07.731 --> 32:10.166
You don't need to hide now.

32:10.233 --> 32:11.935
It's over.

32:14.437 --> 32:16.573
Please, Audrey, give me
some kind of a signal.

32:16.640 --> 32:18.608
Anything, anything
that let's me know

32:18.675 --> 32:20.943
you understand
what I'm saying, please.

32:21.010 --> 32:23.979
Please!

32:26.048 --> 32:27.281
It's all right, I'm...

32:27.348 --> 32:28.817
I'm sorry.

32:28.884 --> 32:31.152
It's all right.

32:31.219 --> 32:33.187
I know you're trying.

32:35.623 --> 32:38.826
I love you with all my heart.

32:52.506 --> 32:54.141
(sizzling)

32:59.913 --> 33:01.048
I'm not going
to let them hurt you,

33:01.114 --> 33:02.082
but they're going
to take you away

33:02.149 --> 33:03.215
from me
for a little while.

33:03.282 --> 33:05.451
There's nothing I can do
to stop that.

33:05.518 --> 33:06.686
Audrey, we're out of time.

33:06.752 --> 33:08.121
Is there anything
that you can tell me

33:08.187 --> 33:09.388
that could help us find Cheng

33:09.455 --> 33:11.190
or at least
where they were holding you?

33:11.257 --> 33:12.825
Please.

33:15.594 --> 33:16.996
Come here.

33:17.063 --> 33:18.397
Come on.

33:18.463 --> 33:20.365
Get down.

33:27.105 --> 33:28.573
Jack, put your gun down.

33:28.640 --> 33:29.874
You put your gun down!

33:29.941 --> 33:31.542
Get him
out of here.

33:31.609 --> 33:33.410
I'm not letting him take
Audrey back to medical.

33:33.477 --> 33:35.412
Jack, you need
to lower your weapon.

33:35.479 --> 33:39.150
Not until I get a guarantee
from you that Audrey is safe!

33:39.216 --> 33:40.784
(quietly):
Bloomfield.

33:40.851 --> 33:41.885
What'd you say?

33:41.953 --> 33:44.421
Bloomfield.

33:44.488 --> 33:45.456
JACK:
Did you hear that?

33:45.522 --> 33:46.490
She said

33:46.557 --> 33:48.091
"Bloomfield."

33:48.158 --> 33:50.059
I asked her where she was being
held; she's trying to answer.

33:50.126 --> 33:51.494
We don't know
if that represents

33:51.561 --> 33:52.729
genuine communication.

33:52.795 --> 33:54.664
"Bloomfield" could be
another programmed response

33:54.731 --> 33:56.165
meaning nothing.

33:56.231 --> 33:57.600
We'll soon find out.

33:57.667 --> 33:58.634
Morris, did you get that?

33:58.701 --> 33:59.969
Bloomfield: have
Chloe track it down,

34:00.036 --> 34:01.037
keep Doyle in the loop.

34:01.104 --> 34:02.504
MORRIS:
All right.

34:02.571 --> 34:03.740
In the meantime, Dr. Bradley,

34:03.806 --> 34:05.640
I'd like you to wait
for me in my office.

34:05.708 --> 34:07.476
I'm not going anywhere;
she's my patient.

34:07.542 --> 34:09.011
And she's my witness.

34:11.981 --> 34:13.849
I suggest you go
with these men, Doctor.

34:21.655 --> 34:24.058
Listen to me, Jack.

34:24.125 --> 34:27.327
You have my word, I will
not let him touch her.

34:28.360 --> 34:30.697
Please,

34:30.764 --> 34:33.167
lower your weapon.

34:42.609 --> 34:45.512
Audrey, please,
it's all right.

34:45.578 --> 34:47.545
He's going
to take care of you.

34:53.719 --> 34:56.255
Jack, I need you to go with
these men to Holding.

35:15.520 --> 35:17.156
--Yes, of course, General.

35:17.222 --> 35:18.757
I'll review the report
with the Vice President.

35:18.825 --> 35:20.659
I'll get right
back to you.

35:24.830 --> 35:26.631
Suvarov wasn't bluffing.

35:26.698 --> 35:27.999
No, sir.

35:28.066 --> 35:30.635
Air Force satellites confirm
the Russian Army is moving

35:30.702 --> 35:33.338
large numbers of troops into
the Central Asian theater.

35:33.405 --> 35:35.207
How long before they're
in range of our base?

35:35.272 --> 35:36.808
They'll be within
strike range

35:36.875 --> 35:38.242
within the hour, sir.

35:38.309 --> 35:39.845
(door opens)

35:41.079 --> 35:43.481
I'm sorry, Mr. Vice President,

35:43.547 --> 35:45.381
I got back here
as soon as I could.

35:53.690 --> 35:55.358
Forward General Wilkes' report
to the Joint Chiefs.

35:55.425 --> 35:56.392
Let me know
their recommendations.

35:56.459 --> 35:59.130
Yes, sir.

36:06.736 --> 36:08.404
(door closes)

36:08.471 --> 36:09.572
What's going on?

36:09.639 --> 36:12.341
Why is Tom talking
to the Joint Chiefs?

36:12.407 --> 36:14.109
Because the Russians know
the Chinese have

36:14.176 --> 36:16.611
the component.

36:16.678 --> 36:18.113
How did that happen?

36:18.180 --> 36:20.281
Someone inside the Beltway has
been selling them information.

36:20.348 --> 36:23.252
Someone with access.

36:23.317 --> 36:25.254
A man named Mark Bishop.

36:25.319 --> 36:27.288
Do you know him?

36:27.355 --> 36:29.457
I believe he's a lobbyist.

36:29.524 --> 36:31.459
Are you sure it's Bishop?

36:31.526 --> 36:33.828
Yes.

36:33.895 --> 36:35.630
We began monitoring
his phone calls

36:35.696 --> 36:37.598
as soon as this came
to our attention.

36:39.801 --> 36:42.636
Ten minutes ago, he called

36:42.702 --> 36:45.304
a known Russian Intelligence
agent from his cell phone.

36:45.371 --> 36:48.008
BISHOP (over recorder):
It's me.

36:48.074 --> 36:49.308
What's my next move?

36:49.375 --> 36:50.844
MAN:
It's imperative you
reach out to her

36:50.911 --> 36:52.012
over the next few hours.

36:52.078 --> 36:53.046
Find out if there are

36:53.113 --> 36:54.281
any developments
with the component.

36:54.346 --> 36:55.848
BISHOP:
I'll call her

36:55.916 --> 36:58.851
and I'll access her PDA again,
see if she has any new e-mail.

36:58.918 --> 36:59.885
MAN:
Very good.

37:06.559 --> 37:09.395
So how well do you know
this man Bishop?

37:11.463 --> 37:13.865
He's an acquaintance.

37:13.932 --> 37:16.366
He consulted on a white paper
last year on defense spending.

37:16.433 --> 37:17.869
Damn it, Lisa,
don't insult me

37:17.936 --> 37:19.536
any more than you already have.

37:19.603 --> 37:21.139
Bishop's been
passing intelligence

37:21.206 --> 37:25.609
to the Russians that
he got from you.

37:25.676 --> 37:28.012
I don't know if he
read your e-mails

37:28.079 --> 37:30.581
or if you talked
about it in bed,

37:30.647 --> 37:32.749
but the Russians know
about the component

37:32.816 --> 37:34.918
and they're threatening
military action against us

37:34.985 --> 37:38.555
if we don't get it
back from the Chinese.

37:38.622 --> 37:41.390
I always knew you
were a good liar.

37:41.457 --> 37:46.095
I just... I just didn't
think you could lie to me.

37:46.162 --> 37:48.698
I guess I thought

37:48.764 --> 37:50.599
too highly of myself.

37:50.666 --> 37:52.935
I swear to you, I didn't know.

37:53.002 --> 37:54.971
It's still treason,

37:55.037 --> 37:58.140
which I don't need to remind
you is a capital offense.

37:58.207 --> 38:00.343
You didn't just betray me,

38:00.408 --> 38:02.510
you betrayed your country.

38:09.484 --> 38:11.886
What do you want from me?

38:11.952 --> 38:14.221
You're going to go
back to your boyfriend

38:14.288 --> 38:15.789
and you're going
to make him believe

38:15.856 --> 38:18.092
that we have the component back.

38:19.159 --> 38:21.095
I can't do that.

38:21.161 --> 38:23.396
You can and you will
do exactly

38:23.463 --> 38:25.165
what Tom Lennox tells you to do.

38:25.232 --> 38:28.969
And don't you even think
about trying to expose our...

38:29.036 --> 38:31.372
relationship.

38:31.437 --> 38:35.309
If you go there, I'll
have you declared

38:35.376 --> 38:37.810
an enemy combatant.

38:37.877 --> 38:40.178
Put you in solitary; it'll
be years before you speak

38:40.246 --> 38:42.648
to anyone about anything.

38:46.385 --> 38:47.719
Noah...

38:58.263 --> 39:00.865
Are you all
right, sir?

39:00.933 --> 39:02.767
I'm better now.

39:02.833 --> 39:04.869
Secret Service is sending over
a team to work with her.

39:04.936 --> 39:05.903
We'll get this going soon.

39:32.228 --> 39:34.297
I've made arrangements
to take you away from here.

39:36.865 --> 39:40.034
I'm going to look after you,
Audie, I promise.

39:40.101 --> 39:41.035
You will get well

39:41.102 --> 39:43.671
and you won't be alone.

39:54.749 --> 39:57.018
I'll be right back, sweetheart.

40:05.193 --> 40:08.128
Before I take my daughter,
I'd like to see Jack Bauer.

40:08.195 --> 40:09.196
Where is he?

40:09.262 --> 40:10.830
He's in Holding, sir.

40:10.896 --> 40:13.833
Escort Mr. Heller to Holding.

40:13.899 --> 40:17.437
Nadia, hey, did Audrey speak
when he was with her?

40:17.503 --> 40:19.905
No, I don't think so.

40:19.972 --> 40:22.575
Well, it turns out the name she
gave us might be a good lead.

40:22.641 --> 40:24.276
There's a Bloomfield Copper
Company that used to have

40:24.343 --> 40:26.544
a refining facility
in Jefferson Heights.

40:26.611 --> 40:27.612
Forensics just found

40:27.680 --> 40:29.415
oxidized copper particles
on her clothing.

40:29.482 --> 40:31.050
You think that's where
Cheng was holding her?

40:31.117 --> 40:33.718
Yeah, I think it might be
his base of operations.

40:33.785 --> 40:35.388
LAPD's locking down
the building,

40:35.454 --> 40:37.788
but I told them to stand
down till I get there.

40:37.855 --> 40:39.457
Good work, Mike.

40:39.523 --> 40:41.426
Thanks.

40:41.493 --> 40:43.495
Mike.

40:46.597 --> 40:48.899
You were right.

40:48.966 --> 40:50.768
I should have stood up
to Dr. Bradley.

40:54.038 --> 40:56.340
You did.

40:56.407 --> 40:59.743
When it counted,
you stood up to him.

41:27.002 --> 41:29.171
Mr. Secretary.

41:29.237 --> 41:31.540
You've seen Audrey.

41:33.809 --> 41:36.010
I made Audrey a promise,
I make the same promise to you.

41:36.077 --> 41:38.912
I will take care of her
as long as it takes.

41:38.979 --> 41:40.247
I will be there for her.

41:40.314 --> 41:43.150
No, you won't, Jack.

41:43.217 --> 41:45.852
Excuse me?

41:45.919 --> 41:48.489
I don't want you to go
anywhere near my daughter

41:48.556 --> 41:50.123
ever again.

41:51.724 --> 41:55.095
Audrey went looking for you
and this is how she came back.

41:55.161 --> 41:58.398
What's happened
to her is your fault.

42:00.033 --> 42:03.601
I accept that responsibility,
but I can help her.

42:06.737 --> 42:08.806
Stay away from her.

42:10.275 --> 42:13.278
Mr. Secretary, earlier
I got through to Audrey.

42:13.345 --> 42:14.712
I can do the same thing again.

42:14.779 --> 42:16.315
I just need some time.
Please.

42:17.682 --> 42:20.918
I'm warning you.

42:20.985 --> 42:23.821
Stay away.

42:30.895 --> 42:33.029
You're cursed, Jack.

42:33.096 --> 42:35.732
Everything you touch,

42:35.733 --> 42:39.635
one way or another,
ends up dead.
