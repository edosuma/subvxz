00:02.180 --> 00:05.140
<b>Lead all the soldiers here on a mission</b>

00:05.140 --> 00:06.720
<b>to capture my food...</b>

00:07.470 --> 00:11.900
<b>Capture more of those highly 
nutritious organisms for me.</b>

00:11.900 --> 00:12.990
<b>At once!</b>

01:34.990 --> 01:40.030
<b>Very x Rapid x Reproduction</b>

01:41.960 --> 01:45.700
<b>Class-1 quarantined insects</b>

01:45.700 --> 01:49.420
<b>and insatiable carnivores: Chimera Ants.</b>

01:49.850 --> 01:53.880
<b>Once they've evolved beyond 
two meters in length,</b>

01:53.880 --> 01:55.920
<b>humans no longer stand a chance.</b>

02:08.950 --> 02:10.830
<b>Hey, what's that?</b>

02:17.660 --> 02:19.700
<b>M-M-Monsters!</b>

02:20.750 --> 02:21.880
<b>Listen carefully!</b>

02:21.880 --> 02:25.010
<b>Target the fully grown ones. 
They will provide the most nutrition.</b>

02:25.010 --> 02:25.950
<b>Now go!</b>

02:59.370 --> 03:01.080
<b>A Chimera Ant queen</b>

03:01.080 --> 03:04.030
<b>moves repeatedly until she 
finds a place she likes.</b>

03:04.540 --> 03:10.450
<b>As she does, she births more and more 
soldier ants to build her own army.</b>

03:11.820 --> 03:13.420
<b>Once she's chosen a location,</b>

03:13.420 --> 03:18.080
<b>she births a large number of carpenter ants, 
which construct her castle with incredible speed.</b>

03:18.590 --> 03:22.510
<b>From then on, the queen remains 
within the castle until death.</b>

03:24.850 --> 03:29.610
<b>So if a Queen grew to two meters tall</b>

03:29.610 --> 03:32.020
<b>and were to set her sights on humans,</b>

03:32.020 --> 03:37.350
<b>there should be entire villages 
or towns of missing people.</b>

03:39.470 --> 03:40.870
<b>I don't see anything...</b>

03:40.870 --> 03:43.910
<b>I just checked the past six months,</b>

03:43.910 --> 03:46.460
<b>and the largest group only numbered ten.</b>

03:46.460 --> 03:49.840
<b>Say, can we look up missing people individually?</b>

03:49.840 --> 03:51.670
<b>Don't be ridiculous.</b>

03:51.670 --> 03:55.210
<b>You know how many hundreds of thousands 
of people go missing worldwide?</b>

03:55.610 --> 03:59.320
<b>We should be able to see which areas 
have the highest concentrations.</b>

04:01.900 --> 04:04.470
<b>No good... The data's two years old.</b>

04:05.610 --> 04:08.500
<b>Perhaps we should start by checking for sightings.</b>

04:08.500 --> 04:11.810
<b>If someone saw a two-meter insect, 
they'd make a big fuss.</b>

04:11.810 --> 04:13.600
<b>We tried that, of course.</b>

04:13.600 --> 04:16.480
<b>But we couldn't find anything.</b>

04:16.860 --> 04:19.360
<b>Maybe we're getting worked up over nothing...</b>

04:19.700 --> 04:21.100
<b>Yeah.</b>

04:22.490 --> 04:25.660
<b>Bring up the tidal data from 
the day the arm was found.</b>

04:27.550 --> 04:30.170
<b>The arm was discovered here...</b>

04:32.420 --> 04:34.570
<b>Now go back ten days.</b>

04:35.630 --> 04:41.260
<b>Locate any currents that may have carried 
the arm to that location in that time.</b>

04:41.660 --> 04:42.860
<b>What do you mean?</b>

04:43.270 --> 04:45.700
<b>It's possible that the arm</b>

04:45.700 --> 04:49.670
<b>was severed after the Chimera Ant made landfall.</b>

04:49.670 --> 04:50.850
<b>That makes sense.</b>

04:54.480 --> 04:57.020
<b>It could have come from any of the Balsa Islands...</b>

04:57.330 --> 05:00.520
<b>Including the Mitene Union.</b>

05:00.890 --> 05:01.990
<b>The Mitene Union...</b>

05:02.450 --> 05:05.280
<b>Oh, where the NGL Autonomous Region is.</b>

05:05.570 --> 05:08.530
<b>Yes, as well as East Gorteau.</b>

05:09.010 --> 05:12.150
<b>There's no getting information 
out of those two countries.</b>

05:12.150 --> 05:13.040
<b>What's this NGL?</b>

05:13.530 --> 05:16.420
<b>An acronym, standing for Neo-Green Life.</b>

05:16.750 --> 05:21.980
<b>It's a country founded by people who wanted to 
live in nature, away from machine civilization.</b>

05:22.660 --> 05:23.550
<b>Here.</b>

05:25.920 --> 05:35.180
<b>Mitene Union: 

NGL Autonomous Region 
Republic of Rokario 
Hass Republic 
Republic of West Gorteau 
Republic of East Gorteau</b>

05:26.580 --> 05:29.060
<b>They primarily communicate by letter.</b>

05:29.060 --> 05:31.080
<b>Primary means of transportation is by horse.</b>

05:31.530 --> 05:35.180
<b>Anyone knowingly bringing technology into 
the country is subject to execution.</b>

05:35.860 --> 05:37.300
<b>In '87,</b>

05:37.300 --> 05:40.720
<b>a three-man TV crew was caught trying 
to enter the country to get a story.</b>

05:40.720 --> 05:44.190
<b>One was executed, and the 
other two remain in prison.</b>

05:45.110 --> 05:50.550
<b>Of its 2.17 million population, 
99% belong to the Neo-Green Life Party,</b>

05:50.550 --> 05:52.530
<b>with the rest being support volunteers.</b>

05:53.040 --> 05:57.080
<b>If the Chimera Ant washed ashore there,</b>

05:57.080 --> 05:59.760
<b>how would the NGL citizenry react?</b>

06:01.490 --> 06:03.410
<b>They probably wouldn't do anything.</b>

06:03.840 --> 06:08.670
<b>When a deadly epidemic spread throughout 
the area, they let nature run its course,</b>

06:09.220 --> 06:12.720
<b>refusing to admit international doctors.</b>

06:13.150 --> 06:18.150
<b>And even if they tried to contact the outside, 
it would be too late by the time word arrived.</b>

06:19.050 --> 06:22.750
<b>If that arm belonged to the Chimera Ant queen,</b>

06:23.250 --> 06:26.790
<b>she may have already begun to build her nest.</b>

06:31.690 --> 06:32.690
<b>A contest?</b>

06:32.690 --> 06:33.240
<b>Yeah...</b>

06:33.890 --> 06:35.490
<b>Between you and me.</b>

06:35.490 --> 06:39.620
<b>Let's see who can bring the Queen more humans.</b>

06:39.620 --> 06:41.130
<b>I challenge you!</b>

06:41.130 --> 06:42.050
<b>Hmph.</b>

06:42.050 --> 06:43.040
<b>What?</b>

06:43.040 --> 06:44.240
<b>You're running away?</b>

06:44.240 --> 06:45.530
<b>Hey, accept my challenge!</b>

06:46.280 --> 06:47.380
<b>Accept?</b>

06:48.740 --> 06:50.510
<b>Are you issuing an order?</b>

06:52.160 --> 06:55.390
<b>Why should I follow an order from you?</b>

06:56.460 --> 06:59.390
<b>I can only follow the Queen's orders.</b>

06:59.730 --> 07:02.450
<b>You're just scared of losing.</b>

07:02.450 --> 07:05.490
<b>My squadron is comprised of elite soldiers.</b>

07:05.490 --> 07:08.150
<b>I can beat any squadron in this castle!</b>

07:08.540 --> 07:10.020
<b>Oh, I know...</b>

07:10.020 --> 07:14.190
<b>I should get the other squadron leaders in on this.</b>

07:14.190 --> 07:17.290
<b>If we all compete, we'll capture more prey.</b>

07:17.710 --> 07:19.010
<b>More prey?</b>

07:19.530 --> 07:20.530
<b>I see...</b>

07:20.890 --> 07:22.470
<b>I agree with that idea.</b>

07:22.840 --> 07:26.300
<b>If we gather more prey, the Queen will be pleased.</b>

07:26.770 --> 07:28.560
<b>Okay, that settles it.</b>

07:28.990 --> 07:31.900
<b>However, I believe that the 
prey's quality also matters.</b>

07:31.900 --> 07:36.340
<b>We must ensure that the Queen 
eats highly nutritious humans.</b>

07:37.000 --> 07:39.560
<b>That guy's such a stiff...</b>

07:40.320 --> 07:42.810
<b>That's what makes him endearing.</b>

07:42.810 --> 07:46.250
<b>He is dedicated and loyal.</b>

07:46.250 --> 07:51.070
<b>I presume the human he was created 
from was also quite earnest.</b>

08:23.430 --> 08:24.890
<b>Hey, wait!</b>

08:24.890 --> 08:27.230
<b>Weren't you supposed to get some rest?</b>

08:27.890 --> 08:29.780
<b>I'll bring her back.</b>

08:29.780 --> 08:31.740
<b>Don't bother, it won't help.</b>

08:32.150 --> 08:35.330
<b>But she goes to the forest every morning,</b>

08:35.330 --> 08:37.660
<b>and she spends the whole day searching.</b>

08:37.660 --> 08:41.490
<b>Right, she'll probably collapse soon...</b>

08:41.490 --> 08:44.750
<b>But she can't stop looking.</b>

08:45.070 --> 08:47.810
<b>That's what it means to be a parent.</b>

08:49.350 --> 08:54.270
<b>How many days has it been since 
Kurt-kun and Reina-chan vanished?</b>

08:54.270 --> 08:56.920
<b>It's like spirits whisked them away.</b>

09:04.610 --> 09:06.040
<b>Big bugs...</b>

09:06.040 --> 09:07.150
<b>Huh?</b>

09:12.060 --> 09:14.280
<b>We haven't raided this area yet.</b>

09:45.810 --> 09:47.280
<b>Mom!</b>

09:49.490 --> 09:51.250
<b>It must be them...</b>

09:51.250 --> 09:55.950
<b>Those monsters must have stolen your children!</b>

10:13.590 --> 10:14.970
<b>Excellent.</b>

10:14.970 --> 10:18.970
<b>This should suffice to please the Queen.</b>

10:30.340 --> 10:32.230
<b>Wh-What's happening?</b>

10:32.900 --> 10:34.730
<b>Exterminate the insects quickly.</b>

10:35.730 --> 10:37.740
<b>That's Gyro's order.</b>

10:38.090 --> 10:39.990
<b>Gyro? What's that?</b>

10:40.610 --> 10:42.570
<b>Our king's name!</b>

10:50.590 --> 10:51.700
<b>Damn!</b>

10:58.020 --> 11:01.720
<b>I bought tickets to the Mitene Union.</b>

11:02.120 --> 11:04.990
<b>But to reach NGL, we have to</b>

11:04.990 --> 11:08.710
<b>take an airship to the neighboring 
Republic of Rokario,</b>

11:08.710 --> 11:11.230
<b>and travel by land from there.</b>

11:11.230 --> 11:14.690
<b>It "ant" gonna be easy to get into 
a country of such nasty rumors.</b>

11:14.690 --> 11:15.480
<b>Just kidding.</b>

11:17.250 --> 11:18.490
<b>Nasty rumors?</b>

11:18.490 --> 11:19.490
<b>What do you mean?</b>

11:22.050 --> 11:23.870
<b>Have you heard of D²?</b>

11:23.870 --> 11:25.240
<b>D²?</b>

11:26.220 --> 11:30.750
<b>It's an ingestible drug that's propagating rapidly 
throughout urban areas worldwide.</b>

11:31.680 --> 11:35.410
<b>It's derived from the bila tree, 
native to the Mitene Union.</b>

11:36.520 --> 11:39.120
<b>And they claim</b>

11:39.120 --> 11:44.510
<b>that over 80% of the world's 
bila trees are located in NGL.</b>

11:44.750 --> 11:49.020
<b>So the nasty rumors are saying that the 
drug is being manufactured in NGL?</b>

11:49.690 --> 11:51.360
<b>They're only rumors.</b>

11:51.640 --> 11:54.350
<b>No one has been able to publicly prove it.</b>

11:54.350 --> 11:56.520
<b>After all, the country's locked down tight.</b>

11:56.890 --> 12:01.030
<b>When people try to get in to 
investigate, they're executed.</b>

12:01.480 --> 12:02.730
<b>Executed...</b>

12:05.300 --> 12:06.530
<b>He wasn't executed?</b>

12:08.150 --> 12:13.120
<b>No, if he'd been captured trying 
to uncover NGL's secrets,</b>

12:13.120 --> 12:17.170
<b>he'd have probably been executed 
like that TV crewman.</b>

12:17.540 --> 12:20.130
<b>But this reporter was wearing a wire,</b>

12:20.130 --> 12:24.160
<b>from which we intercepted the final message.</b>

12:24.600 --> 12:26.430
<b>When the message was played...</b>

12:26.820 --> 12:28.720
<b><i>M-Monsters...</i></b>

12:28.720 --> 12:30.410
<b><i>Giant bugs!</i></b>

12:32.700 --> 12:34.440
<b>Giant bugs?</b>

12:36.010 --> 12:37.150
<b>What do you think?</b>

12:38.990 --> 12:41.680
<b>That isn't enough information to be sure...</b>

12:44.840 --> 12:49.080
<b>As a Magical Beast Hunter, 
I'll have to see for myself.</b>

12:49.490 --> 12:50.900
<b>Then that settles it.</b>

12:50.900 --> 12:53.140
<b>I'll get three tickets.</b>

12:53.140 --> 12:54.330
<b>Make it four.</b>

12:56.510 --> 12:57.460
<b>Ponzu...</b>

12:57.460 --> 12:59.150
<b>I'm coming with you.</b>

12:59.150 --> 12:59.910
<b>You can't.</b>

12:59.910 --> 13:01.220
<b>This is too dangerous,</b>

13:01.220 --> 13:03.690
<b>and you don't have a professional license yet.</b>

13:03.690 --> 13:05.930
<b>And we're talking about NGL...</b>

13:05.930 --> 13:07.470
<b>That's why I should come.</b>

13:08.120 --> 13:11.130
<b>You aren't allowed to bring technology into NGL.</b>

13:11.130 --> 13:14.000
<b>If they discover you with cell phones 
or wireless communicators,</b>

13:14.000 --> 13:16.480
<b>you'll be arrested right away.</b>

13:16.740 --> 13:20.180
<b>So if there's any trouble, you'll need me...</b>

13:20.180 --> 13:23.380
<b>Or rather, you'll need them.</b>

13:29.080 --> 13:32.120
<b>They can carry a letter anywhere.</b>

13:34.450 --> 13:35.500
<b>I get it.</b>

13:35.500 --> 13:37.180
<b>They'll certainly come in handy.</b>

13:49.120 --> 13:51.530
<b>It may be a bit late to ask,</b>

13:52.160 --> 13:53.890
<b>but are you sure you want to come?</b>

13:53.890 --> 13:55.020
<b>Of course!</b>

13:55.020 --> 13:57.390
<b>You weren't kidding about the "late" part.</b>

13:58.050 --> 14:02.400
<b>We have no idea what the situation is inside NGL.</b>

14:03.400 --> 14:06.560
<b>There may very well be a swarm 
of giant Chimera Ants already,</b>

14:06.560 --> 14:08.830
<b>hunting humans down.</b>

14:09.430 --> 14:12.410
<b>If that turns out to be the case,</b>

14:12.910 --> 14:15.710
<b>my priority will be saving them.</b>

14:15.710 --> 14:18.420
<b>So I may not be able to help you.</b>

14:18.970 --> 14:21.060
<b>You must be able to protect yourselves.</b>

14:21.060 --> 14:23.210
<b>If you want to come, that's the requirement.</b>

14:23.210 --> 14:24.930
<b>Okay, got it.</b>

14:24.930 --> 14:25.920
<b>We'll be fine.</b>

14:27.060 --> 14:30.740
<b>And if I'm the one who's in danger,</b>

14:31.270 --> 14:33.180
<b>you should escape without me.</b>

14:36.410 --> 14:37.180
<b>Got it?</b>

14:55.540 --> 14:57.490
<b>A pretty good haul.</b>

14:59.000 --> 15:03.100
<b>But it's not even half the size of 
what my squadron delivered...</b>

15:03.960 --> 15:05.780
<b>My focus was quality.</b>

15:06.240 --> 15:08.470
<b>And I wasn't competing against you.</b>

15:09.840 --> 15:10.920
<b>Whatever.</b>

15:11.370 --> 15:12.710
<b>Anyway, did you hear?</b>

15:12.710 --> 15:15.600
<b>That turtle guy ran into human resistance.</b>

15:16.510 --> 15:17.600
<b>Resistance?</b>

15:19.600 --> 15:20.600
<b>Hmm,</b>

15:20.890 --> 15:23.480
<b>those were probably guns.</b>

15:23.770 --> 15:24.900
<b>Guns?</b>

15:24.900 --> 15:28.750
<b>Put simply, it's a barrel that launches 
metal projectiles called bullets</b>

15:28.750 --> 15:31.860
<b>using the explosive force of gunpowder.</b>

15:32.310 --> 15:35.610
<b>It's one of the most commonly 
used human weapons.</b>

15:35.610 --> 15:38.620
<b>No idea what you're talking about...</b>

15:38.620 --> 15:41.410
<b>If you want the details, read books.</b>

15:41.410 --> 15:42.700
<b>Books are wonderful.</b>

15:42.700 --> 15:45.990
<b>You can learn about how these 
human creatures think,</b>

15:45.990 --> 15:49.380
<b>behave, and function as a society.</b>

15:49.380 --> 15:52.070
<b>Can you answer my question, then?</b>

15:52.070 --> 15:54.780
<b>Do humans have armies too?</b>

15:54.780 --> 15:55.970
<b>Armies?</b>

15:55.970 --> 15:59.470
<b>Yes, that was an army.</b>

15:59.890 --> 16:04.810
<b>They belong to a military body 
led by an authoritative figure,</b>

16:04.810 --> 16:07.570
<b>much like ourselves!</b>

16:08.740 --> 16:11.780
<b>Ah, I have another question.</b>

16:11.780 --> 16:14.800
<b>They mentioned something about a name.</b>

16:14.800 --> 16:16.060
<b>A name?</b>

16:16.840 --> 16:18.780
<b>I can't blame you for not understanding.</b>

16:19.410 --> 16:23.290
<b>Because it's a human idea 
we do not make use of.</b>

16:23.600 --> 16:25.440
<b>Put simply...</b>

16:27.530 --> 16:30.450
<b>So it seems there are humans</b>

16:30.450 --> 16:33.550
<b>capable of more than running and crying.</b>

16:36.030 --> 16:38.280
<b>I don't know why that should surprise you.</b>

16:38.280 --> 16:41.060
<b>Given how different you and I are,</b>

16:41.320 --> 16:44.650
<b>it's only natural that individual humans 
would have unique traits as well.</b>

16:46.190 --> 16:49.980
<b>After all, their blood flows through us.</b>

16:55.840 --> 16:58.240
<b>Assemble, squadron leaders!</b>

17:01.730 --> 17:04.270
<b>Assemble, squadron leaders!</b>

17:05.510 --> 17:07.500
<b>The Queen summons us.</b>

17:07.940 --> 17:10.120
<b>Assemble, squadron leaders!</b>

17:11.290 --> 17:14.980
<b>Do you get a headache when 
the Queen calls to us?</b>

17:15.470 --> 17:18.200
<b>Yeah, my ears start ringing.</b>

17:18.820 --> 17:22.850
<b>It's too bad the Queen can't talk like we do.</b>

17:29.680 --> 17:33.380
<b>I shall now begin preparations 
for the King's birth.</b>

17:34.950 --> 17:40.410
<b>Every day, provide me with fifty humans.</b>

17:40.410 --> 17:41.580
<b>Yes, Majesty!</b>

17:43.690 --> 17:46.980
<b>Your Majesty, may I ask a question?</b>

17:46.980 --> 17:48.420
<b>Permitted. Speak.</b>

17:49.400 --> 17:52.670
<b>Among the humans are soldiers like ourselves,</b>

17:52.670 --> 17:55.550
<b>with weapons to use against us.</b>

17:56.100 --> 18:00.020
<b>We must fortify our defenses,</b>

18:00.020 --> 18:03.470
<b>in preparation for any potential attack.</b>

18:03.810 --> 18:08.420
<b>I have a few ideas... 
Would you care to hear them?</b>

18:08.420 --> 18:11.190
<b>I shall let you decide your course.</b>

18:11.190 --> 18:14.740
<b>I must focus entirely on my son.</b>

18:15.180 --> 18:18.570
<b>Yes, and one more thing...</b>

18:18.570 --> 18:23.080
<b>Would you allow us to have names?</b>

18:23.440 --> 18:25.080
<b>What is a name?</b>

18:25.550 --> 18:31.250
<b>It's like a code that can be 
used to identify each of us.</b>

18:32.740 --> 18:35.090
<b>Very well, do as you like.</b>

18:35.410 --> 18:37.780
<b>I am truly grateful!</b>

18:42.270 --> 18:44.310
<b><i>How peculiar.</i></b>

18:44.310 --> 18:47.990
<b><i>They speak their minds and 
request to use these names.</i></b>

18:47.990 --> 18:52.140
<b><i>While bettering the race, they compete for glory,</i></b>

18:52.140 --> 18:54.810
<b><i>leading to a stronger sense of individuality.</i></b>

18:59.420 --> 19:03.740
<b><i>I suppose I am also peculiar to 
find this change fascinating.</i></b>

19:04.180 --> 19:10.120
<b><i>Perhaps I, too, have traces 
of human blood within me.</i></b>

19:12.870 --> 19:17.380
<b><i>Regardless, I feel quite confident now.</i></b>

19:18.190 --> 19:24.390
<b><i>I can see you already, as though 
recalling a memory from my past.</i></b>

19:25.700 --> 19:27.570
<b><i>My King...</i></b>

19:27.570 --> 19:31.650
<b><i>You shall stand atop this world!</i></b>

19:40.120 --> 19:43.410
<b><i>Names... Quite amusing.</i></b>

19:45.370 --> 19:47.480
<b><i>The King's three Royal Guards.</i></b>

19:47.860 --> 19:51.240
<b><i>I shall name you myself.</i></b>

19:56.840 --> 19:59.170
<b>What did you just decide?</b>

19:59.540 --> 20:02.090
<b>Remember what Kite said before we left?</b>

20:02.090 --> 20:05.010
<b>That we should escape without 
him if he's in danger.</b>

20:05.010 --> 20:08.490
<b>Yeah, I don't think it was a choice...</b>

20:08.490 --> 20:09.310
<b>Yeah.</b>

20:10.110 --> 20:13.510
<b>That's why neither of us said anything,</b>

20:14.620 --> 20:16.860
<b>but I've been thinking.</b>

20:17.480 --> 20:20.650
<b>Is it possible for Kite, who earned Ging's respect,</b>

20:20.650 --> 20:23.150
<b>to be in that much danger?</b>

20:25.120 --> 20:30.360
<b>You said that Ging had a reason for 
bringing Kite and me together...</b>

20:30.360 --> 20:31.250
<b>Yeah.</b>

20:31.820 --> 20:34.460
<b>You're probably right.</b>

20:34.970 --> 20:37.810
<b>I don't know the reason,</b>

20:37.810 --> 20:41.250
<b>but I can't give up halfway, 
no matter what's going on.</b>

20:41.610 --> 20:44.470
<b>Otherwise, I'll disappoint Ging.</b>

20:44.830 --> 20:47.700
<b>Of course, I could never forgive myself, either.</b>

20:49.030 --> 20:50.640
<b>So I won't run away.</b>

20:50.640 --> 20:52.150
<b>That's what I've decided.</b>

20:54.740 --> 20:55.730
<b>Man,</b>

20:56.240 --> 20:58.270
<b>you had this totally serious expression,</b>

20:58.270 --> 21:00.670
<b>so I was expecting something big.</b>

21:00.670 --> 21:02.520
<b>But it's just business as usual.</b>

21:02.520 --> 21:04.960
<b>Huh? I thought about this a lot.</b>

21:04.960 --> 21:07.780
<b>I even ran a bunch of mental simulations...</b>

21:08.910 --> 21:11.310
<b>Think all you want, but you'll still be Gon.</b>

21:11.310 --> 21:13.750
<b>If someone said you should abandon them,</b>

21:13.750 --> 21:15.640
<b>you'd never do it.</b>

21:16.870 --> 21:20.170
<b>You make it sound like I wasted 
my time considering it.</b>

21:20.450 --> 21:22.600
<b>Then what about you?</b>

21:23.190 --> 21:26.760
<b>I'm a spontaneous guy, so I'd think 
about it when the time comes.</b>

21:26.760 --> 21:28.850
<b>You mean you might run away?</b>

21:28.850 --> 21:30.600
<b>Depends.</b>

21:30.600 --> 21:33.770
<b>I can't say until it actually happens.</b>

21:34.040 --> 21:35.360
<b>Say for instance...</b>

21:35.360 --> 21:38.600
<b>I can't tell you what I'd do in 
a hypothetical situation.</b>

21:38.600 --> 21:40.820
<b>I don't decide until it's time.</b>

21:44.790 --> 21:50.530
<b>The airship carrying the group 
heads for the Mitene Union,</b>

21:50.960 --> 21:57.120
<b>still unaware of the cruel fate 
that lies in wait for them...</b>

23:25.300 --> 23:27.800
<b>Next time: No x Good x NGL.</b>

23:27.800 --> 23:29.550
<b>Ready, start!</b>

23:29.550 --> 23:32.760
<b>Does that mean the queen isn't her— hur hur...</b>

23:33.220 --> 23:35.010
<b>And there's your outtake!</b>
