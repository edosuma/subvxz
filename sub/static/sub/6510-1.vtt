04:55.804 --> 04:57.055
Holy shit!

05:30.797 --> 05:33.174
Come on, Arnie.

05:37.512 --> 05:40.640
He's coming! He's changing his shirt.

05:41.766 --> 05:43.935
That's noise pollution, what you're doing.

05:47.355 --> 05:50.233
You might as well be dumping
toxic waste on our lawn.

05:50.400 --> 05:53.194
Hey, Dennis. I'll be right there.

05:55.196 --> 05:56.698
Just leave it. It's okay.

05:56.865 --> 05:58.241
Go on, it's okay.

05:58.408 --> 06:01.327
Arnie! Your lunch.

06:03.162 --> 06:06.583
- Keep it cold, there's yogurt in there.
- Right.

06:16.092 --> 06:17.760
Slow down!

06:24.434 --> 06:26.769
- You guys having a war?
- She's pissed...

06:26.936 --> 06:29.939
...l'm taking Shop,
like it embarrasses her. My dad too.

06:30.106 --> 06:34.027
It won't embarrass them when their Volvo
breaks down, you fix it for free.

06:34.193 --> 06:35.862
- What?
- We were playing Scrabble.

06:36.029 --> 06:39.115
It was between me and her.
We blew my dad away early.

06:39.282 --> 06:41.910
At the end, I had this choice
of putting down "ratio"...

06:42.076 --> 06:44.621
...for like five lousy points, or...

06:44.787 --> 06:46.289
- Or what, Arnie?
-"Fellatio."

06:46.456 --> 06:49.667
- For 24 points and the game.
- What'd she do?

06:49.834 --> 06:53.796
She wouldn't let me. She won by seven.
She said obscenity's not allowed.

06:53.963 --> 06:57.759
- I looked it up, and it's in the dictionary.
- You jerk, Arnie.

06:57.926 --> 06:59.093
Jesus.

07:02.513 --> 07:05.516
You know, Arnie, I was thinking...

07:07.560 --> 07:09.646
No, seriously.

07:09.812 --> 07:13.441
Now that we're gonna be seniors,
I figured it's about time...

07:13.608 --> 07:17.153
...that we got you laid,
you know, like this year.

07:17.654 --> 07:19.322
You need a girl to get laid.

07:20.114 --> 07:21.950
What about Gail Justin, huh?

07:22.116 --> 07:24.786
Oh, Gail "Just In Case"?
I don't like her mustache.

07:24.953 --> 07:29.248
Fuck you. What do you care if you get
a little hair in your mouth, huh?

07:30.375 --> 07:32.168
Okay.

07:33.294 --> 07:35.838
- How about Sally Hayes? She's cute.
- She's a sophomore.

07:36.005 --> 07:39.676
So what? She's a walking sperm bank,
Arnie. I know. Come on.

07:39.842 --> 07:43.346
I don't think I have the minimum deposit
to open an account.

07:43.513 --> 07:47.517
Are you kidding? You carry
your life savings between your legs.

07:48.601 --> 07:50.687
Come on, Arnie.

07:50.853 --> 07:53.356
I think maybe I'll just beat off.

08:00.655 --> 08:02.740
Guilder, you playing football this year?

08:02.907 --> 08:05.243
Yeah. Somebody's gotta pick it up
when you fumble.

08:05.410 --> 08:07.662
- Hey, Terry.
- How's your gimpy knee?

08:07.829 --> 08:11.165
- Better. Coach wants me to practice.
-lt's about time.

08:11.332 --> 08:14.669
I've been eating dirt with your name on it
for the past three weeks.

08:16.879 --> 08:18.297
Hi, Dennis.

08:19.298 --> 08:22.093
Oh, hey, Roseanne. How you doing?

08:22.510 --> 08:26.264
I'm okay. They gonna
let you play football this year?

08:26.431 --> 08:29.767
Yeah. Doc says I'm as good as new.

08:30.435 --> 08:32.937
Then I guess I'll be seeing you out there.

08:34.938 --> 08:36.691
I hope so.

08:38.025 --> 08:40.611
Well, TTFN.

08:40.778 --> 08:43.740
Yeah, ta-ta for now.

08:49.162 --> 08:51.956
I wouldn't put that in my mouth.
Don't know where it's been.

08:52.123 --> 08:54.709
- Get out of here.
- We know where it hasn't been.

08:54.876 --> 08:56.461
Hasn't been with you, huh?

08:56.627 --> 08:59.213
- Having trouble with your locker?
- No.

08:59.380 --> 09:01.966
- Did you see the new girl?
- I just got here.

09:02.133 --> 09:03.968
I'm in love. She's perfect.

09:04.135 --> 09:07.388
- You know how fussy I am.
- I never noticed you were fussy.

09:07.555 --> 09:09.474
- Drop dead, Cunningham.
- What's her name?

09:09.640 --> 09:12.477
I don't know. She's in the office.
She looks smart.

09:12.643 --> 09:15.980
But she's got the body of a slut.

09:16.564 --> 09:18.107
Oh, shit.

09:18.274 --> 09:21.736
- Here she comes.
- I think you'll like it here, Leigh.

09:22.779 --> 09:24.280
Give me something for my lap.

09:24.447 --> 09:27.617
We have a good marching band.
Went to the Rose Parade last year.

09:27.784 --> 09:29.535
Not a bad way to meet boys.

09:29.702 --> 09:31.746
I'd like to get involved
with the yearbook.

09:31.913 --> 09:35.833
We have a terrific yearbook staff.
It won a prize last year.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.171
So, what do you think about
admitting Red China into the U.N.?

09:40.338 --> 09:42.924
- I think we already did that.
- Yeah...

09:43.591 --> 09:46.010
...but do you think it was a good idea?

09:47.178 --> 09:48.763
She smiled at me.

09:48.930 --> 09:52.183
I wanna have deep,
meaningful sex with her.

09:52.350 --> 09:55.144
- Go get her, Bemis.
- Think I should?

09:55.311 --> 09:58.523
Yeah. You've got nothing to lose
but your virginity.

10:00.858 --> 10:04.529
Dennis, can you give me
a hand with this? I can't--

10:04.695 --> 10:06.155
Yeah.

10:06.322 --> 10:08.157
He doesn't have a chance.

10:08.324 --> 10:12.370
I don't think so either.
She's much too classy for him.

10:12.829 --> 10:15.081
- There you go.
- What did you do?

10:15.248 --> 10:17.542
Lucky. See you at lunch.

10:17.708 --> 10:19.377
Okay.

10:31.597 --> 10:33.599
Hey, Charlie, have you seen Arnie?

10:33.766 --> 10:36.686
- Yeah, he's still in the shop.
- What's the matter?

10:36.853 --> 10:40.022
- Buddy Repperton has his lunch.
- Buddy Repperton.

10:40.189 --> 10:42.024
Hi, Dennis.

10:45.486 --> 10:48.531
- Come on, pizza-face.
- Look at him.

10:48.698 --> 10:50.366
Come on, pizza-face.

10:51.659 --> 10:54.120
You want it? Come get it!

10:54.954 --> 10:58.332
If it's yours, why doesn't it have
your name on here anywhere?

10:58.499 --> 11:00.084
Arnie "Cunt-ingham."

11:01.210 --> 11:06.090
- Why doesn't it say "Cunt-ingham"?
- Just take it, Arnie, and let's go eat.

11:09.886 --> 11:12.305
Yeah, that's all you gotta do. Come on.

11:15.141 --> 11:16.726
Come on.

11:17.852 --> 11:19.478
Come on.

11:23.816 --> 11:25.860
That's funny, Buddy. Real funny.

11:42.668 --> 11:43.794
Go get Mr. Casey.

11:45.671 --> 11:47.256
You wanna go for it?

11:49.008 --> 11:51.761
- Put the knife down and I will.
- Put down the knife.

11:51.928 --> 11:53.054
You wanna make me?

11:54.430 --> 11:57.808
You got a knife, and he doesn't.
That makes you a chickenshit.

11:57.975 --> 12:00.603
- Yeah, that's chickenshit.
- Oh, yeah?

12:00.770 --> 12:03.522
- Put it down, Buddy.
- Yeah, put down the knife.

12:04.023 --> 12:05.524
Just put down the knife, okay?

12:09.695 --> 12:10.821
Just put it down.

12:16.661 --> 12:19.121
Boy took a feather on that one.

12:19.622 --> 12:22.708
- Come on! Come on!
- Get it, man! Get it, man!

12:28.047 --> 12:30.591
Come on, Buddy, stick him.
Stick him, Buddy.

12:43.312 --> 12:46.482
How do you like that, dick-face?

12:48.651 --> 12:51.570
All right, break it up!
Break it up right now.

12:51.737 --> 12:55.533
You kids, take a walk. Take a walk.
Get lost. Not you, Moochie.

12:55.700 --> 12:58.911
- I ain't been doing nothing.
- You all right, Dennis?

13:00.746 --> 13:04.000
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

13:05.710 --> 13:08.254
Real cute, huh? Three on one.

13:11.090 --> 13:13.009
- They started it.
- Yeah.

13:13.175 --> 13:15.428
- That's not true.
- Shut up, cunt-face!

13:15.594 --> 13:17.430
Hey, you wanna shut your mouth?

13:17.596 --> 13:20.766
I don't have to listen to garbage
like that coming from you!

13:24.103 --> 13:25.521
What were you saying?

13:26.689 --> 13:28.316
Reppert0n's got a knife.

13:28.482 --> 13:30.818
You fucking liar.

13:30.985 --> 13:33.154
It's a switchblade.

13:33.321 --> 13:37.199
That's bullshit, Mr. Casey.
He's lying. I swear to God.

13:38.409 --> 13:39.535
Cunningham...

13:40.286 --> 13:42.955
...did Repperton here pull a knife on you?

13:50.921 --> 13:52.381
Yeah.

13:52.923 --> 13:55.009
Empty your pockets, Buddy.

13:57.428 --> 14:00.097
Fuck I will. You can't make me.

14:00.264 --> 14:03.476
If you mean I don't have the authority,
you're wrong. If you mean--

14:03.642 --> 14:07.521
Try it, you little bald fuck,
and I'll knock you through the wall. Fuck!

14:13.611 --> 14:15.988
You two go up to the office. Stay there.

14:16.155 --> 14:19.658
Don't go anywhere else,
you got enough trouble without that.

14:20.618 --> 14:26.040
Now, if you don't empty your pockets
right now, I'm gonna call the cops.

14:38.094 --> 14:39.637
Go to the office, Buddy.

14:45.810 --> 14:47.853
I'll fix you!

14:49.730 --> 14:52.566
You're gonna wish
you were never fucking born!

15:04.829 --> 15:09.750
So, all in all, it wasn't a bad first day.

15:09.917 --> 15:11.669
Yeah.

15:12.461 --> 15:16.507
- Think Repperton will try to get even?
- No, he's a douche bag.

15:16.674 --> 15:19.260
He'll find somebody else to pick on.

15:19.427 --> 15:22.388
- They kicked him out, you know.
- Good.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.598
They kick Moochie out?

15:24.765 --> 15:26.767
Probation.

15:26.934 --> 15:29.270
Those assholes.

15:30.396 --> 15:32.940
Stop the car, Dennis. Quick. Go back!

15:33.107 --> 15:35.484
- What's the matter?
- I wanna look at her.

15:35.651 --> 15:37.778
- All right. Calm down.
- Just go back.

15:37.945 --> 15:40.322
Jesus Christ.

15:47.037 --> 15:48.956
What is it, huh?

15:50.666 --> 15:53.043
Do you know someone who lives here?

16:00.885 --> 16:02.386
What?

16:09.894 --> 16:11.604
Jesus.

16:26.577 --> 16:29.079
Hey, careful, Dennis.

16:30.539 --> 16:32.082
This is a piece of shit.

16:32.249 --> 16:34.835
Well, she could be fixed up. She could.

16:35.002 --> 16:37.922
- Yeah.
- She could be really tough.

16:43.636 --> 16:47.014
Forget it, Arnie.
This baby's got 93,000 miles on it.

16:48.098 --> 16:50.100
Probably 193.

16:50.267 --> 16:52.144
I don't care.

16:52.311 --> 16:54.230
I bet it won't even start.

16:54.396 --> 16:55.773
She'll start.

16:56.273 --> 16:58.108
You need these.

17:05.241 --> 17:09.578
How much do you want for her?
I mean, whatever it is, it's not enough.

17:09.744 --> 17:10.913
Jesus, Arnie.

17:19.630 --> 17:22.758
Sonny, you ever owned a car before?

17:23.925 --> 17:28.639
- Yeah, he owns a Mustang--
- No, I just got my license.

17:30.599 --> 17:32.184
Name's George LeBay.

17:32.977 --> 17:36.313
Arnie Cunningham.
What are you asking?

17:37.731 --> 17:38.774
Start her up.

17:40.693 --> 17:42.319
Really?

17:48.242 --> 17:49.451
Jesus.

17:49.618 --> 17:51.787
Her name's Christine.

17:54.039 --> 17:55.874
I like that.

17:56.875 --> 17:58.627
Come on, we gotta get going.

17:58.794 --> 18:01.839
My asshole brother bought her
back in September '57.

18:02.423 --> 18:05.384
That's when you got
your new model year, in September.

18:05.551 --> 18:07.803
Brand-new, she was.

18:08.304 --> 18:10.806
She had the smell of a brand-new car.

18:10.973 --> 18:15.185
That's just about the finest smell
in the world. Except, maybe, for pussy.

18:17.354 --> 18:20.107
When he got her,
she had six miles on the odometer.

18:21.483 --> 18:24.403
Goddamn Roland went through hell
and back with Christine.

18:24.987 --> 18:28.824
If your brother loves this car so much,
why is he selling it?

18:31.243 --> 18:33.329
He's stone-cold dead, that's why.

18:34.038 --> 18:35.831
Died six weeks ago.

18:35.998 --> 18:38.500
So, Mr. LeBay...

18:39.376 --> 18:41.045
...how much do you want for her?

18:41.712 --> 18:43.839
I've been asking 300.

18:44.632 --> 18:46.800
I'll make it 250 for you.

18:46.967 --> 18:50.638
Two-fifty?
Arnie, this thing isn't worth 50 bucks.

18:51.096 --> 18:53.891
The money's not important.
And no bringing her back here.

18:54.058 --> 18:56.393
I'm selling this shithole
and buying me a condo.

18:56.977 --> 18:58.437
You got a deal.

18:59.021 --> 19:00.898
I'll get the pink slip.

19:04.818 --> 19:08.155
Arnie, will you stop and think about this
for a moment?

19:08.322 --> 19:10.574
- Where you getting the money?
-l've been saving.

19:10.741 --> 19:11.784
For college.

19:11.950 --> 19:15.537
- Easy for you to say. You have a car.
- He's screwing you.

19:15.704 --> 19:17.998
You could get a decent car
for that money.

19:18.165 --> 19:20.709
Oh, Christine is decent.

19:21.043 --> 19:22.878
The guy's weird, Arnie.

19:23.045 --> 19:24.922
He's fucking weird.

19:25.089 --> 19:28.634
- So that was 300?
- Yeah, that's it.

19:28.801 --> 19:31.929
- You said 250.
- Two-fifty would do it.

19:32.096 --> 19:35.974
If this is such a good idea,
let's just come back tomorrow.

19:36.141 --> 19:41.271
Do you realize she's 20 years old?
That makes her officially an antique.

19:41.438 --> 19:45.943
Great. Great, Arnie, Darnell's junkyard
is full of official antiques.

19:46.110 --> 19:49.321
Look, I'm buying her.
I don't care what you say.

19:49.488 --> 19:51.782
Hey, your funeral, man.

19:57.788 --> 20:00.916
Hey. Look, mister,
would you give Arnie a break?

20:01.083 --> 20:03.460
He's a stupid kid.
He doesn't know what he's doing.

20:04.253 --> 20:07.506
You don't know half as much
as you think you do.

20:07.673 --> 20:09.299
Shitter.

20:11.844 --> 20:12.094
You did what?

20:12.094 --> 20:13.095
You did what?

20:13.721 --> 20:15.055
She's outside.

20:15.222 --> 20:17.391
Well, you're kidding, right?

20:17.558 --> 20:20.728
You can't buy a car.
What are you talking about?

20:20.894 --> 20:23.480
You're 17 years old.

20:23.647 --> 20:24.940
Oh, boy.

20:25.107 --> 20:27.735
Well, actually, you're wrong.
I couldn't finance it...

20:27.901 --> 20:30.738
...but buying it for cash
is no problem at all.

20:31.280 --> 20:34.491
Registering a car at 17
is something else again.

20:34.658 --> 20:36.618
For that, I need your permission.

20:36.785 --> 20:38.871
Arnie, you know how we do things.

20:39.747 --> 20:41.582
You could've consulted with us.

20:42.958 --> 20:46.295
I've consulted with you
about everything I've ever done.

20:46.462 --> 20:50.591
Everything here is a committee meeting,
and I get outvoted 2-to-1.

20:50.758 --> 20:53.302
This is no meeting. I bought it, that's it.

20:53.761 --> 20:57.014
It most certainly is not it.

20:57.514 --> 21:00.851
And how could you have let him do this?

21:01.852 --> 21:04.730
I didn't let him.
He wanted the car, and he bought it.

21:06.106 --> 21:08.442
I tried to talk him out of it, in fact.

21:09.318 --> 21:12.070
I doubt that you tried very hard.

21:12.696 --> 21:15.699
- Yeah, well, I'm going home.
- I think you should.

21:15.866 --> 21:17.826
I'm getting the fuck out of here.

21:17.993 --> 21:21.497
- Arnie, what kind of language--?
- What did you say?!

21:22.456 --> 21:24.416
What did you say?

21:24.583 --> 21:27.336
You wanted me
in college courses, I'm there.

21:27.503 --> 21:30.422
You wanted me in the chess club,
I'm there too.

21:30.589 --> 21:34.718
Now, I've managed 17 years without
embarrassing you or landing in jail.

21:34.885 --> 21:37.846
I'm telling you,
I'm gonna have this one thing.

21:38.430 --> 21:43.101
You are not keeping any car
at this house.

21:43.685 --> 21:44.728
Fine.

21:52.027 --> 21:53.403
Thanks for the milk.

22:33.694 --> 22:37.823
- What's the problem?
- Could you honk your horn for me?

22:37.990 --> 22:41.451
- Christine's doesn't seem to work.
- Yeah, sure.

22:41.618 --> 22:43.161
Thanks.

23:15.319 --> 23:17.362
Stall 20.

23:17.529 --> 23:19.448
Stall 20!

23:19.615 --> 23:21.909
Get it over there and shut it off...

23:22.075 --> 23:24.703
...before we all choke to death.

23:27.372 --> 23:31.168
Kiddo, you sold him that,
you ought to be ashamed of yourself.

23:31.335 --> 23:34.254
I didn't sell it to him,
I tried to talk him out of it.

23:34.421 --> 23:36.798
You should've tried harder.

23:50.604 --> 23:53.857
I knew a guy had a car like that once.

23:54.024 --> 23:56.944
Fucking bastard killed himself in it.

23:57.110 --> 24:01.073
He was so mean, you could've
poured boiling water down his throat...

24:01.239 --> 24:04.076
...he would've pissed ice cubes.

24:04.576 --> 24:06.244
Okay.

24:07.537 --> 24:11.375
That's the last time you run that in here
without an exhaust hose.

24:11.541 --> 24:14.586
I catch you doing it one time
and you're out. You understand?

24:16.630 --> 24:17.923
Yes.

24:18.090 --> 24:20.676
I'm gonna tell you something else
right now.

24:21.593 --> 24:25.973
I don't take any shit from you kids.
This place is for working stiffs.

24:26.139 --> 24:28.809
Gotta keep their cars running
to keep bread on the table.

24:28.976 --> 24:32.312
It's not for rich-ass, snot-nosed kids
who wanna go dragging.

24:32.479 --> 24:35.107
I don't allow no smoking in here neither.

24:35.273 --> 24:37.317
You want a butt, go out in the junkyard.

24:37.484 --> 24:40.362
- I don't smoke.
- Don't interrupt me, punk.

24:40.529 --> 24:43.240
Don't interrupt me. Don't get smart.

24:44.783 --> 24:46.660
- Sir?
- What?

24:48.286 --> 24:49.746
Those men are smoking.

24:50.831 --> 24:52.499
Better tell them to stop.

24:54.376 --> 24:58.505
You trying to help
your buddy right out of here, Chuck?

25:01.425 --> 25:02.801
No.

25:02.968 --> 25:05.429
Then shut your piehole.

25:05.595 --> 25:07.639
I know a creep when I see one.

25:09.725 --> 25:12.477
I think I'm looking at one right now.

25:15.230 --> 25:18.066
You're on probation, you get it?

25:18.233 --> 25:22.112
Screw around one time, I don't care
how much money you've paid...

25:22.279 --> 25:25.699
...l'll throw you out on your ass.
You got it?

25:27.409 --> 25:29.161
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
- Come on.

25:29.327 --> 25:30.996
Good.

25:34.499 --> 25:37.335
Now, get the hell out of here.
We're closed.

25:55.312 --> 25:57.355
Are you gonna be okay?

25:59.775 --> 26:02.069
Yeah, I'm okay.

26:06.239 --> 26:11.578
You know, you gotta find yourself some
other charity besides me and Christine.

26:13.997 --> 26:16.083
What is it about that car, huh?

26:19.294 --> 26:21.046
I don't know.

26:22.964 --> 26:28.053
Maybe, for the first time in my life, I've
found something that's uglier than me.

26:28.512 --> 26:30.889
And I know I can fix her up.

26:31.056 --> 26:33.600
You're not ugly, Arnie.

26:35.644 --> 26:37.187
I know what I am.

26:38.772 --> 26:40.857
Queer, maybe, but not ugly.

26:41.858 --> 26:43.860
Fuck you.

26:44.402 --> 26:46.029
Arnold?

26:51.284 --> 26:54.037
Bug out, Dennis. You don't need this shit.

27:03.421 --> 27:04.965
Where have you been?

27:05.132 --> 27:09.052
You had us worried sick.
You don't just drive off whenever you--

27:47.465 --> 27:51.094
He's done all this shit in three weeks.

27:51.595 --> 27:54.389
Look how cockeyed he works, Pepper.

27:54.556 --> 27:57.684
He's got fucking
brand-new windshield wipers...

27:57.851 --> 28:00.437
...for a busted windshield.

28:02.063 --> 28:04.232
Well, the boy does have good hands.

28:04.399 --> 28:06.276
Good hands.

28:06.943 --> 28:09.905
Bad taste in cars.

28:10.447 --> 28:12.032
You know, Pepper...

28:12.199 --> 28:15.410
...you can't polish a turd.

28:41.728 --> 28:43.396
You know...

28:43.563 --> 28:46.691
...when I said you could scrounge
through the shitpile out back...

28:46.858 --> 28:51.112
...l didn't mean you could build
your whole fucking car with my stuff.

28:51.529 --> 28:55.200
What do you care? I mean,
you're not doing anything with it.

28:55.367 --> 28:58.662
Hey, don't think you got
the gold key to the crapper.

28:58.828 --> 29:01.539
Nobody takes advantage of me,
you understand?

29:03.083 --> 29:04.376
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

29:04.542 --> 29:09.256
If it wasn't for me, it'd cost you a shitpile
of dough to put this heap together.

29:09.422 --> 29:12.008
I know. I know.

29:16.096 --> 29:17.639
<i>Look...</i>

29:19.349 --> 29:23.645
I know you ain't exactly got money
falling out of your asshole.

29:23.812 --> 29:26.356
If you did, you wouldn't be here.

29:28.650 --> 29:31.987
Maybe we could work out
some kind of a deal.

29:37.742 --> 29:39.411
You...

29:40.203 --> 29:42.497
...pick up around the place.

29:42.664 --> 29:44.708
Do a few lubes.

29:45.542 --> 29:48.712
Put the toilet paper on the little spools.

29:48.878 --> 29:50.797
Shit like that.

29:51.214 --> 29:53.216
Do that and you can--

29:53.383 --> 29:56.678
You can raid myjunk pile
for whatever you want.

29:58.096 --> 30:01.391
I might even throw in a few bucks.

30:03.268 --> 30:04.936
I'll have to think about it.

30:05.895 --> 30:10.525
Well, don't think about it too long,
I'll throw you out on your fucking ass.

31:17.384 --> 31:20.345
I'll bet you a dollar she says no.

31:20.512 --> 31:22.347
Just because she shot you down?

31:22.514 --> 31:24.808
She says no to everybody.

31:33.775 --> 31:35.777
Look what she's doing to that pencil.

31:35.944 --> 31:38.738
I wish I was an eraser.

31:41.699 --> 31:46.204
- Go on, studly, ask her out.
- Mind your own business. Just read.

31:46.371 --> 31:50.041
Yeah, come on, Guilder.
Just don't tip the table over.

31:50.208 --> 31:52.001
Okay.

31:56.965 --> 31:58.591
Okay.

32:50.477 --> 32:52.312
Hey, what are you reading?

32:53.396 --> 32:55.064
History.

32:56.524 --> 32:58.651
It's pretty boring, huh?

32:59.402 --> 33:00.862
Yeah.

33:01.029 --> 33:02.655
Listen, do you like music?

33:05.909 --> 33:07.076
What about dancing?

33:08.661 --> 33:10.246
Yes.

33:11.247 --> 33:13.291
You think maybe, you might...?

33:13.958 --> 33:16.336
You might wanna
go out dancing with me...

33:16.503 --> 33:20.006
...like, maybe this Friday night,
after the game?

33:20.632 --> 33:22.717
I'm sorry, I can't.

33:34.979 --> 33:36.022
Why not?

33:38.733 --> 33:40.109
I have a date.

33:40.693 --> 33:43.947
Mr. Guilder, are you lost?

33:45.740 --> 33:47.200
No, ma'am.

33:47.367 --> 33:50.495
Why don't you return to your own seat
and get back to work?

33:52.205 --> 33:53.248
Yeah.

34:16.145 --> 34:18.648
Arnie, stay here so we can talk this over.

34:18.815 --> 34:22.527
This isn't a hotel you can drop in
and out of whenever you feel like it.

34:22.694 --> 34:24.904
- I don't need this.
- What do you need?

34:25.362 --> 34:30.076
- I need to leave. I'm late.
- You come back here this instant! Arnie!

34:30.243 --> 34:33.580
- Hey, Arnie.
- Oh, shit.

34:34.205 --> 34:36.081
Greetings to you too.

34:38.585 --> 34:41.713
Hey, man, no glasses.
You're looking good.

34:41.879 --> 34:45.717
I can't make it.
I meant to call you, but I forgot.

34:46.801 --> 34:50.013
- Okay.
-ls Dennis going with you?

34:50.429 --> 34:52.306
Are you going with him?

34:53.224 --> 34:54.766
- Am I?
- No.

34:54.934 --> 34:56.936
Gotta do an errand for Darnell.

34:57.103 --> 35:00.064
- You need a ride?
- Got his car. Thanks, though.

35:00.231 --> 35:04.402
Look, I'm sorry about the movie,
but this is work. Gotta go.

35:04.569 --> 35:06.112
Don't worry about it.

35:06.279 --> 35:08.906
Did you have plans with Dennis?

35:10.033 --> 35:13.244
Arnold Cunningham, you're going
to find yourself with no friends...

35:13.411 --> 35:16.539
-...if you keep treating people this way.
- Get off my back!

35:20.460 --> 35:23.504
You're his best friend. What's going on?

35:27.884 --> 35:30.970
I don't know.
I mean, I hardly see him anymore.

35:32.847 --> 35:34.349
Neither do we.

35:34.515 --> 35:35.933
Yeah.

35:36.976 --> 35:41.105
Ever since he bought that car,
he's been obsessed with it.

35:41.522 --> 35:42.607
And you know what else?

35:44.067 --> 35:46.569
When we signed
the registration papers at town hall...

35:48.237 --> 35:49.864
...they told us...

35:50.031 --> 35:52.367
...the man who owned that car last...

35:52.533 --> 35:55.745
...died in it,
of carbon monoxide poisoning.

35:58.373 --> 36:00.166
Jesus.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.377
Does Arnie know?

36:04.087 --> 36:07.924
Arnie doesn't know anything anymore.

36:22.063 --> 36:23.815
What the hell do you want?

36:23.981 --> 36:25.817
I know about your brother.

36:28.027 --> 36:31.489
I know he died,
choking on exhaust fumes.

36:31.656 --> 36:33.950
You don't know shit, kid.

36:34.325 --> 36:37.036
My brother died because he wanted to.

36:37.829 --> 36:40.331
He ran a rubber hose
from the exhaust pipe.

36:40.498 --> 36:44.669
Arnie would've never bought that car
if he'd known somebody died in it.

36:44.836 --> 36:48.172
Either you're dumber than you look,
or you don't know your friend well.

36:48.339 --> 36:51.217
He had the same look in his eye
my brother always had.

36:52.260 --> 36:57.181
Probably the only thing my brother ever
loved in his whole rotten life was that car.

36:57.348 --> 37:02.645
No shitter ever came between him
and Christine. If they did, watch out.

37:03.771 --> 37:07.984
His 5-year-old daughter choked to death
in her. He wouldn't get rid of her.

37:08.151 --> 37:12.280
Just rode around, the radio blaring,
not a care except for Christine.

37:13.656 --> 37:16.701
Only time I interfered with it
was when Rita killed herself.

37:16.868 --> 37:19.954
- Who's Rita?
- His wife.

37:20.705 --> 37:25.168
He didn't care a rat's ass about her.
She died the same way he did.

37:25.334 --> 37:27.670
Then I made him get rid of it...

37:28.337 --> 37:30.506
...for decency, you know?

37:32.049 --> 37:36.471
- The car came back three weeks later.
- What do you mean, "came back"?

39:40.136 --> 39:41.554
All right, 50 pass on go.

39:41.721 --> 39:45.016
- Fifty pass on go. Ready?
- Break!

39:45.182 --> 39:48.769
Hey, Brian, you want me to go--?
You want me to go deep or flat?

39:48.936 --> 39:52.773
Hang out in the flat, and I'll hit you
on the second shot coming around.

40:05.411 --> 40:07.121
Hey, Trelawney...

40:07.830 --> 40:11.667
-...is that Cunt-ingham's car?
- Yep.

40:11.834 --> 40:13.711
I know where he keeps it.

40:33.606 --> 40:35.316
Set! Go!

41:04.220 --> 41:06.681
Yeah, son of a bitch, yeah!

41:06.847 --> 41:09.517
- Shit.
- Yeah!

41:19.110 --> 41:21.487
Get a stretcher! Come on.

42:15.499 --> 42:17.168
Hey, Arnie.

42:21.255 --> 42:23.049
Five thousand dirty limericks.

42:24.383 --> 42:26.802
Ought to keep you busy for a while.

42:27.845 --> 42:30.431
This is the third time I've come by.

42:30.848 --> 42:33.851
Must be dynamite drugs,
you're always asleep.

42:34.727 --> 42:36.812
It doesn't quite kill the pain.

42:38.731 --> 42:42.109
You know, Rockbridge hasn't won
a game since you got hurt.

42:42.568 --> 42:45.237
Guess that makes you
some kind of hero, right?

42:45.404 --> 42:50.159
They tell you that I'm not gonna be
playing football again? Ever.

42:53.079 --> 42:56.040
Doctor said that one--
One centimeter more...

42:56.207 --> 42:59.293
...and I would've been paralyzed
from the waist down.

43:01.962 --> 43:03.756
Shitters did some job on you, huh?

43:06.050 --> 43:09.053
So, what's this about--?
About you and Leigh Cabot?

43:10.346 --> 43:12.640
We like each other okay.

43:13.432 --> 43:15.726
Listen to Mr. Cool.

43:16.560 --> 43:19.563
She happens to be
the most beautiful girl in the school.

43:19.730 --> 43:21.941
Well, it's not what you think.

43:22.108 --> 43:26.403
You know, I really respect her mind...

43:26.570 --> 43:28.906
...and she lusts after my body.
What can I say?

43:29.073 --> 43:30.407
Fuck you.

43:30.574 --> 43:32.284
Yeah.

43:33.661 --> 43:35.955
I saw you guys at the football game.

43:37.998 --> 43:40.709
How'd you ever get that car
fixed up like that?

43:41.168 --> 43:45.089
Oh, just plain, old-fashioned hard work.

43:46.632 --> 43:48.342
I still can't keep her at home.

43:48.509 --> 43:51.011
Mom says it makes
the yard look crowded.

43:51.178 --> 43:55.266
-L'm surprised they let you register it.
- Told them if they didn't...

43:55.432 --> 43:56.976
...l'd drop out of school.

43:57.935 --> 43:59.228
You serious?

44:03.190 --> 44:07.736
They just don't want me to grow up.
Then they'd have to face getting old.

44:17.997 --> 44:20.291
Has it ever occurred to you...

44:21.792 --> 44:24.170
...that part of being a parent...

44:25.171 --> 44:27.423
...is trying to kill your kids?

44:30.551 --> 44:32.595
See you around, pal.

45:23.812 --> 45:27.233
I'm sorry, Arnie, I can't. I'm sorry.

45:47.670 --> 45:50.839
What's the matter? What's wrong?

45:52.800 --> 45:55.386
I can't. Here.

45:58.722 --> 46:00.683
In that car.

46:02.977 --> 46:05.145
What are you talking about? Why not?

46:07.189 --> 46:08.774
Because I hate that car.

46:08.941 --> 46:12.820
I mean, you care more about that car
than you care about me.

46:16.156 --> 46:17.700
That's crazy, Leigh.

46:18.200 --> 46:20.703
Who do you spend more time with?

46:23.622 --> 46:25.499
Look...

46:25.666 --> 46:28.836
...you're gonna get a cold. Come on.

46:29.461 --> 46:31.171
Come on.

46:54.445 --> 46:57.948
I thought girls were supposed
to be jealous of other girls, not cars.

46:59.533 --> 47:00.993
This car's a girl.

47:01.160 --> 47:02.578
Oh, please.

47:06.874 --> 47:08.792
Cut it out. Don't.

47:08.959 --> 47:10.502
What?

47:11.170 --> 47:12.963
Don't like me slapping your girl?

47:22.890 --> 47:26.727
It seems like nobody likes my car
these days.

47:48.832 --> 47:50.584
Oh, shit.

48:26.286 --> 48:28.622
Leigh. Leigh!

48:35.879 --> 48:37.714
Leigh!

48:55.107 --> 48:58.026
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

48:59.153 --> 49:02.156
You get your goddamn hands off her!

49:32.978 --> 49:34.021
Hey.

49:37.191 --> 49:38.859
You gonna be all right?

49:40.027 --> 49:41.778
Yeah, I'm fine now.

49:42.404 --> 49:44.239
You scared the hell out of me.

49:44.823 --> 49:46.366
Then get rid of that car.

49:48.952 --> 49:50.954
I'm not going in that car again.

49:51.455 --> 49:54.917
Wait a minute. Don't you blame
your choking on Christine.

49:55.334 --> 49:56.793
It happened, Arnie.

49:56.960 --> 49:59.338
When I choked, something happened.

49:59.505 --> 50:00.672
The radio came on.

50:01.757 --> 50:05.052
- Everything got bright.
- So, what are you saying?

50:06.720 --> 50:09.139
I could've died
and you didn't even help.

50:09.306 --> 50:13.268
- My door was locked.
- You didn't want that man to help me.

50:13.435 --> 50:16.939
I thought he was attacking you.
I could've done the Heimlich maneuver.

50:17.105 --> 50:18.398
But you didn't!

50:20.692 --> 50:22.319
And there are other things.

50:22.486 --> 50:23.612
That radio...

50:24.404 --> 50:26.865
...all it gets are those old songs.

50:27.032 --> 50:31.620
And sometimes when we're making out,
it just stalls.

50:32.329 --> 50:34.331
As if the car were jealous, Arnie.

50:35.874 --> 50:37.751
A goddamn car!

50:40.212 --> 50:42.714
Leave it alone. I'll get it.

50:43.757 --> 50:45.592
You know what I think?

50:45.759 --> 50:48.679
I think you're just sexually frustrated.

50:56.228 --> 50:57.354
Look, Leigh...

50:58.814 --> 51:00.649
...l'm sorry. Okay?

51:03.318 --> 51:05.279
Can I at least call you tomorrow?

51:13.704 --> 51:15.706
I don't know.

51:42.482 --> 51:44.067
Come on.

51:45.360 --> 51:47.029
Come on, Christine.

51:55.120 --> 51:57.205
Come on, baby, please.

51:57.372 --> 52:00.709
It's all right. Everything is the same.

52:10.886 --> 52:12.554
Okay.

54:01.329 --> 54:03.248
Check this out!

54:14.468 --> 54:15.886
Come on.

55:16.321 --> 55:17.989
Now, I'll just be a second.

55:18.156 --> 55:21.117
I just gotta get my wallet out of Christine.

55:22.828 --> 55:24.704
You wanna come in with me?

55:26.581 --> 55:28.166
Please.

55:30.043 --> 55:31.670
Okay.

55:44.474 --> 55:48.270
You know, I've been thinking.

55:48.436 --> 55:51.773
Maybe we should apply
to the same colleges next year.

55:54.317 --> 55:56.403
- Really?
- Yeah.

55:56.570 --> 56:00.073
I mean, that way, if we get accepted
by the same schools...

56:00.240 --> 56:02.534
...we could take it as a sign of fate.

56:03.076 --> 56:07.539
You'd have me to help you through
the math courses and, you know, if I--

56:09.332 --> 56:12.168
Arnie, what's wrong?

56:12.335 --> 56:14.129
Arnie.

57:00.759 --> 57:02.302
Arnie.

57:04.930 --> 57:06.723
Who did this?

57:23.323 --> 57:25.075
Arnie?

57:26.242 --> 57:27.702
Don't touch me, shitter!

57:27.869 --> 57:32.707
This is just what you wanted, wasn't it?
Get away from her! Get away from her!

57:35.418 --> 57:37.921
Arnie, I'm sorry.

57:39.923 --> 57:41.466
Sorry?

57:41.633 --> 57:43.259
Yes.

57:44.302 --> 57:45.887
L5'

57:46.972 --> 57:49.724
- That is, we--
-lt's your fault.

57:51.476 --> 57:55.647
If you hadn't been so selfish,
you wouldn't let me park my car...

57:55.814 --> 57:58.900
...in your precious driveway,
this never would've happened.

57:59.067 --> 58:00.735
Arnie, that's not fair.

58:00.902 --> 58:02.779
Oh, it's fair.

58:05.073 --> 58:08.201
Can't we even talk about this...

58:08.368 --> 58:10.245
...like rational human beings?

58:10.412 --> 58:13.039
One of them took a shit
on the dashboard, Ma.

58:13.206 --> 58:15.375
Now, how's that for rational, huh?

58:19.254 --> 58:21.047
Why don't we...?

58:23.049 --> 58:26.386
Your mother and I have decided
to help you buy a new car.

58:30.974 --> 58:34.519
Well, that's what everybody wants,
isn't it?

58:36.354 --> 58:37.522
Well, fuck you.

58:38.523 --> 58:40.692
I'm fixing up Christine.

58:48.658 --> 58:52.037
Listen, you've been disrespectful to us
once too often!

58:52.203 --> 58:54.372
You go apologize to your mother.

58:54.539 --> 58:57.709
Hey, take your mitts off me,
motherfucker.

59:05.633 --> 59:07.552
I'm hitting the sack.

59:37.540 --> 59:39.751
We'll make it better, huh?

59:41.086 --> 59:43.254
Can't hurt us anymore.

59:44.547 --> 59:46.674
Not if we work together.

59:49.177 --> 59:52.055
We'll show those shitters
what we can do.

01:00:36.307 --> 01:00:38.017
Okay.

01:00:39.102 --> 01:00:40.728
Show me.

01:03:22.473 --> 01:03:23.516
Hey, Cunningham.

01:03:27.437 --> 01:03:29.731
Is that you, Cunningham?

01:03:34.068 --> 01:03:36.487
Hey, you ain't mad, are you?

01:04:27.372 --> 01:04:28.998
Oh, shit.

01:05:33.438 --> 01:05:35.982
You're a dead man now.

01:06:22.403 --> 01:06:23.988
Where have you been, asshole?

01:06:26.282 --> 01:06:28.826
You hear about what happened
to Moochie?

01:06:30.203 --> 01:06:31.871
Yeah.

01:06:34.332 --> 01:06:37.376
Almost makes you feel sorry
for the little bastard.

01:06:44.091 --> 01:06:47.512
- How's Christine coming?
- Oh, cherry.

01:06:47.678 --> 01:06:50.848
I spent a shitload of money on her
and she's perfecto now.

01:06:53.392 --> 01:06:58.689
That's funny, you know,
because I heard she was totaled.

01:06:58.856 --> 01:07:02.443
Well, after I cleaned up
the broken glass, it wasn't so bad.

01:07:07.365 --> 01:07:09.534
Bet you a hundred bucks...

01:07:10.493 --> 01:07:12.453
...it was Buddy Repperton.

01:07:13.704 --> 01:07:15.206
Maybe.

01:07:15.748 --> 01:07:17.750
So, what if you--?

01:07:17.917 --> 01:07:20.503
You fix it up and he just does it again?

01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:23.464
He won't do it again.

01:07:25.132 --> 01:07:26.842
What does that mean?

01:07:27.468 --> 01:07:29.345
Man, I gotta go.

01:07:29.512 --> 01:07:32.848
I hope you didn't think
I could hang around here all day.

01:07:33.182 --> 01:07:35.851
Yeah, that's you, Arnie,
always in demand.

01:07:37.562 --> 01:07:39.397
Stay loose.

01:07:41.899 --> 01:07:43.693
You know it.

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:48.197
Happy Thanksgiving.

01:08:03.671 --> 01:08:05.756
Lean machine.

01:08:07.174 --> 01:08:08.551
They let you out early?

01:08:10.177 --> 01:08:11.429
Yeah, that's right.

01:08:11.596 --> 01:08:13.180
Arnold Cunningham.

01:08:14.181 --> 01:08:17.475
I'm Rudolph Junkins,
state police, detective.

01:08:17.643 --> 01:08:20.104
I'm just missing a study hall.
I gotta get to work.

01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:23.274
No, I don't care about that.
I wanna ask about your car.

01:08:24.233 --> 01:08:28.029
You do nice bodywork, Arnie.
I thought this thing was totaled.

01:08:29.071 --> 01:08:31.323
- Who told you that?
- Why, hell, everybody.

01:08:31.490 --> 01:08:35.161
Local police, your mom and dad,
your girl. Cute girl, by the way.

01:08:36.662 --> 01:08:39.081
It wasn't anywhere near as bad
as it looked.

01:08:39.247 --> 01:08:40.707
No?

01:08:41.542 --> 01:08:44.295
The report said
they punched holes in the body.

01:08:44.462 --> 01:08:46.380
Damned if I can see the fill.

01:08:46.546 --> 01:08:48.090
Well, you can if you look.

01:08:48.256 --> 01:08:51.176
It's-- It's right over there.

01:08:51.344 --> 01:08:53.595
And back here.

01:08:53.763 --> 01:08:57.433
I've been lucky with parts.
I replaced the entire door on this side.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:00.728
- Oh, yeah?
- See where the paint doesn't match?

01:09:02.104 --> 01:09:03.439
Nope.

01:09:03.606 --> 01:09:05.316
A hell of a job.

01:09:05.483 --> 01:09:08.819
- Hell of a job, Arnie.
- Well, thank you very much.

01:09:33.469 --> 01:09:36.971
Okay. So, what do you want, huh?

01:09:37.139 --> 01:09:41.268
I really like this shade of red.
Didn't think they made this anymore.

01:09:41.435 --> 01:09:44.522
- They still make this shade?
- Well, they must.

01:09:44.689 --> 01:09:47.274
- I mean, I bought it, didn't I?
- Where?

01:09:48.192 --> 01:09:52.238
- Baker Auto, out on Route 5. Okay?
- You still got the receipt?

01:09:53.322 --> 01:09:54.490
Tossed it out.

01:09:58.202 --> 01:10:01.622
You know, it's funny-- Cigarette?

01:10:01.789 --> 01:10:03.124
No, thanks.

01:10:03.290 --> 01:10:06.377
Usually, when somebody trashes a car,
we get photos.

01:10:06.544 --> 01:10:09.964
Wait, wait, wait.
They didn't really trash it, okay?

01:10:10.131 --> 01:10:12.174
Well, that's not what Leigh said.

01:10:12.341 --> 01:10:15.428
She was so shaken up
giving me all the details...

01:10:15.594 --> 01:10:17.138
...she broke down crying.

01:10:17.930 --> 01:10:19.974
I understand...

01:10:20.850 --> 01:10:24.937
...one of the perpetrators defecated
on the dashboard.

01:10:25.688 --> 01:10:27.815
I would've thought
you'd be madder than hell.

01:10:27.982 --> 01:10:30.526
I would've thought
you would've reported that.

01:10:31.485 --> 01:10:33.446
Shit wipes off.

01:10:34.947 --> 01:10:37.908
Moochie Welch kind of got wiped off too,
didn't he?

01:10:40.244 --> 01:10:41.579
I don't know.

01:10:42.079 --> 01:10:44.540
- You don't know?
- No.

01:10:44.707 --> 01:10:46.417
Scout's honor?

01:10:47.084 --> 01:10:49.211
I'm not a Scout.

01:10:50.588 --> 01:10:54.425
The kid was cut in half. They had
to scrape his legs up with a shovel.

01:10:55.009 --> 01:10:57.470
Isn't that what you're supposed
to do with shit...

01:10:57.636 --> 01:10:59.722
...scrape it up with a little shovel?

01:11:01.307 --> 01:11:03.809
Don't get smart with me, son.

01:11:04.810 --> 01:11:07.646
Your girlfriend is a lot more convincing
than you are.

01:11:14.945 --> 01:11:16.864
She's not my girlfriend.

01:11:17.031 --> 01:11:20.242
And since when is it against the law
to fix up your own car...

01:11:20.409 --> 01:11:22.703
...when somebody else busts it up, huh?

01:11:22.870 --> 01:11:24.580
Since never.

01:11:25.498 --> 01:11:27.958
Then you get off my back.

01:11:30.544 --> 01:11:31.879
Okay.

01:11:45.059 --> 01:11:46.644
Hello.

01:11:46.811 --> 01:11:48.062
Hi, Leigh.

01:11:48.229 --> 01:11:51.524
Look, I need to talk to you.
I need to see you.

01:11:53.317 --> 01:11:55.861
Arnie, I care about you.

01:12:00.449 --> 01:12:02.952
Look, I love you, Leigh.

01:12:03.911 --> 01:12:06.747
I think we deserve one more try.

01:12:07.957 --> 01:12:09.583
DOn"[ you?

01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:13.087
Will you give me a fucking yes or no?!

01:12:13.254 --> 01:12:16.090
Arnie, please don't do this to me.

01:12:16.257 --> 01:12:19.093
Just be straight with me, okay?
You've had it, right?

01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:21.720
Well, fuck you, bitch!

01:12:24.181 --> 01:12:27.309
Leigh? Leigh? Leigh--

01:13:06.765 --> 01:13:09.310
Wanna do the honors, monsieur?

01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:14.440
-I'd love to bring her along.
- Sure.

01:13:14.607 --> 01:13:17.151
- She can earn her way.
- Bullshit.

01:13:17.318 --> 01:13:19.570
Let's get Vandenberg.

01:13:21.113 --> 01:13:22.698
Baby.

01:14:19.797 --> 01:14:21.382
Asshole.

01:14:25.094 --> 01:14:26.762
Watch this.

01:14:32.393 --> 01:14:35.771
Let's give this asshole
some of his own medicine.

01:14:40.484 --> 01:14:42.569
He's backing up too.

01:15:17.855 --> 01:15:20.607
Some shithead's following me!

01:15:22.067 --> 01:15:23.819
L just hope he comes in here!

01:15:52.473 --> 01:15:55.350
- Is that Cunningham?
- Can't be.

01:15:57.061 --> 01:15:58.812
Look at my car.

01:15:58.979 --> 01:16:01.815
Come on, prick! We're not finished yet!

01:16:03.734 --> 01:16:04.985
Come on!

01:19:17.803 --> 01:19:20.138
Hello, Henry, this is Will.

01:19:20.305 --> 01:19:23.600
Listen, Cunningham get there?

01:19:23.767 --> 01:19:25.686
Is the order okay?

01:19:25.852 --> 01:19:27.312
Good.

01:19:27.771 --> 01:19:31.066
Listen, he was driving my Caddy,
wasn't he?

01:19:32.067 --> 01:19:35.404
Good. Yeah, take it easy.

01:20:06.184 --> 01:20:08.186
Okay, Jack...

01:20:09.062 --> 01:20:11.023
...come on out.

01:20:12.065 --> 01:20:14.026
The ride is over.

01:20:17.529 --> 01:20:20.532
If I'm gonna have to come in
and get you...

01:20:21.533 --> 01:20:23.702
...l'm gonna get you.

01:20:39.051 --> 01:20:42.012
Now, why don't you do us both a favor?

01:20:42.179 --> 01:20:44.097
Come on out.

01:22:11.226 --> 01:22:12.352
All right.

01:22:13.061 --> 01:22:14.479
All right.

01:23:08.241 --> 01:23:10.035
- What's going on?
- You tell me.

01:23:10.202 --> 01:23:13.330
- Where were you last night?
- Home. What are you doing to my car?

01:23:13.497 --> 01:23:14.831
You didn't go out at all?

01:23:15.582 --> 01:23:19.711
Of course I went out. I got Darnell's car
out front, with a load of parts.

01:23:20.128 --> 01:23:22.797
- You want the receipt?
- Yeah.

01:23:32.015 --> 01:23:34.476
How come you're showing up just now?

01:23:34.643 --> 01:23:37.062
Why didn't you unload the stuff
last night?

01:23:37.229 --> 01:23:39.773
Because I was tired, that's why.

01:23:41.525 --> 01:23:44.402
If you don't believe me,
you can ask my mother.

01:23:44.903 --> 01:23:47.322
Why do you keep butting into my life?

01:23:47.489 --> 01:23:51.910
Because we found your boss,
Will Darnell, dead, in your front seat...

01:23:52.077 --> 01:23:54.162
...with a shotgun by his side.

01:24:09.886 --> 01:24:14.057
- Why?
- I was hoping you could answer that.

01:24:14.224 --> 01:24:17.435
Somebody saw your car cruising
behind Buddy Repperton last night.

01:24:17.894 --> 01:24:19.729
He's dead too.

01:24:19.896 --> 01:24:23.984
So are Don Vandenberg
and Richard Trelawney.

01:24:24.359 --> 01:24:26.695
Guess nobody will be trashing
your car anymore.

01:24:28.572 --> 01:24:30.407
Well, all I know--

01:24:35.036 --> 01:24:38.999
All I know is, I got a Cadillac full of parts,
and I'm supposed to be at school.

01:24:39.165 --> 01:24:42.711
We'll take care of the Caddy.
I don't want you touching it.

01:24:48.675 --> 01:24:53.138
Honest, Mr. Junkins, I don't know
what's going on. I swear, I don't.

01:24:58.643 --> 01:25:00.437
May I please speak to Dennis?

01:25:01.813 --> 01:25:04.399
It's a girl.

01:25:05.191 --> 01:25:06.693
Hello.

01:25:07.152 --> 01:25:09.487
Hey, Leigh. Happy New Year.

01:25:10.447 --> 01:25:13.408
Can I come over there?
I need to talk to you.

01:25:14.659 --> 01:25:15.785
What, about Arnie?

01:25:16.453 --> 01:25:18.496
About Christine.

01:25:19.456 --> 01:25:21.124
Okay.

01:25:22.208 --> 01:25:23.918
You first.

01:25:26.546 --> 01:25:28.715
I'm afraid for Arnie.

01:25:30.383 --> 01:25:32.093
I thought this was about Christine.

01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:34.679
What do you know about that car?

01:25:36.306 --> 01:25:38.808
I know that the guy
who owned the car before Arnie...

01:25:38.975 --> 01:25:40.477
Yeah?

01:25:40.644 --> 01:25:43.229
His daughter choked to death
in Christine.

01:25:43.396 --> 01:25:44.522
How do you know that?

01:25:46.066 --> 01:25:49.152
LeBay's brother sold Arnie the car.
The guy's a jerk.

01:25:49.319 --> 01:25:53.615
- He just came out and told me.
- I think I was supposed to be next.

01:25:56.326 --> 01:25:58.370
Come on, Leigh.

01:26:00.705 --> 01:26:03.249
Arnie would never do that.

01:26:04.334 --> 01:26:06.419
Not in a million years, okay?

01:26:10.131 --> 01:26:12.342
I don't think he's Arnie, Dennis.

01:26:15.762 --> 01:26:17.097
It's that car.

01:26:17.806 --> 01:26:20.225
I swear, it's the car.

01:26:20.392 --> 01:26:21.434
Maybe.

01:26:22.852 --> 01:26:25.230
I'm going to Arnie's for New Year's--

01:26:25.397 --> 01:26:28.358
- Dennis, I wouldn't.
- No, it's okay.

01:26:28.525 --> 01:26:31.945
We do it every year.
His folks are gonna be there. I just--

01:26:32.112 --> 01:26:35.448
I just figured that if I get him alone,
he'll talk to me.

01:26:35.615 --> 01:26:39.077
- What if he doesn't?
- What do you mean?

01:26:39.703 --> 01:26:44.332
I don't know. I mean, what if--?
What if that car doesn't let him?

01:26:48.336 --> 01:26:50.380
Then we destroy it.

01:27:50.356 --> 01:27:53.359
Hey, my man,
you're really operating those babies.

01:27:54.444 --> 01:27:56.613
Yeah, I manage.

01:27:57.572 --> 01:28:00.033
I see we got the old rust bucket tonight.

01:28:00.575 --> 01:28:03.328
You wanna watch what you call my car?

01:28:03.495 --> 01:28:05.538
She's real sensitive.

01:28:05.705 --> 01:28:07.290
Is she?

01:28:09.876 --> 01:28:11.836
Sorry, Christine.

01:28:12.003 --> 01:28:13.713
Good boy.

01:28:15.006 --> 01:28:16.549
Let's motivate.

01:28:53.962 --> 01:28:57.674
Well, have a beer. Don't be shy.
My car's your car.

01:29:04.931 --> 01:29:06.975
A toast.

01:29:07.141 --> 01:29:11.938
Death to the shitters of the world in 1979.

01:29:12.647 --> 01:29:15.775
Come on, Arnie, I can't drink to that.

01:29:16.568 --> 01:29:18.486
What can you drink to?

01:29:18.653 --> 01:29:21.698
What about to us?
You know, to friendship?

01:29:21.865 --> 01:29:25.952
Friendship. Right, that's good.
That's real good.

01:29:44.637 --> 01:29:45.680
Hey, Dennis.

01:29:48.933 --> 01:29:51.060
- Come on!
- I want you to see this.

01:29:51.227 --> 01:29:53.563
I want you to see this.
This is great alignment.

01:29:53.730 --> 01:29:55.815
You just don't see this anymore.

01:30:02.655 --> 01:30:04.449
Don't be scared.

01:30:06.743 --> 01:30:09.037
I'm scared for you,
for what's happened to you.

01:30:09.203 --> 01:30:11.372
It's this fucking car.

01:30:12.749 --> 01:30:14.959
I know you're jealous.

01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:19.422
We'll always be friends,
as long as you stick with me.

01:30:19.589 --> 01:30:22.717
And you know what happens
to shitters who don't.

01:30:23.217 --> 01:30:25.470
No. What does happen?

01:30:26.262 --> 01:30:28.973
Well, let's not kid each other, Dennis.

01:30:29.891 --> 01:30:31.476
Who are the shitters?

01:30:33.144 --> 01:30:34.896
All of them.

01:30:38.107 --> 01:30:39.776
Arnie...

01:30:40.485 --> 01:30:42.820
...Leigh is on your side.

01:30:42.987 --> 01:30:46.658
- Oh, yeah?
- She cares a lot about you.

01:30:49.077 --> 01:30:50.995
She does.

01:30:51.371 --> 01:30:52.872
Yeah.

01:30:54.082 --> 01:30:56.793
Don't you like this beer?
Thought you liked beer.

01:30:56.960 --> 01:30:58.753
Did you hear what I just said?

01:30:59.712 --> 01:31:02.590
Let me tell you
a little something about love.

01:31:02.757 --> 01:31:05.385
It has a voracious appetite.

01:31:05.718 --> 01:31:07.470
It eats everything.

01:31:07.637 --> 01:31:10.556
Friendship, family.

01:31:10.723 --> 01:31:14.811
It kills me how much it eats.
But I'll tell you something else.

01:31:14.978 --> 01:31:19.148
Feed it right, it can be a beautiful thing,
and that's what we have.

01:31:20.441 --> 01:31:24.112
When someone believes in you,
you can do anything in the universe.

01:31:24.278 --> 01:31:27.323
When you believe right back
in that someone, watch out, world!

01:31:27.490 --> 01:31:29.993
Because nobody can stop you.
Nobody, ever!

01:31:33.538 --> 01:31:35.581
And you feel this way about Leigh?

01:31:38.001 --> 01:31:40.253
What? Fuck, no.

01:31:40.420 --> 01:31:42.171
I'm talking about Christine.

01:31:42.338 --> 01:31:44.674
No shitter ever came
between me and Christine.

01:31:46.384 --> 01:31:47.760
Now, you watch this!

01:31:52.432 --> 01:31:53.641
Oh, shit.

01:32:00.898 --> 01:32:02.942
Chickenshit!

01:32:05.653 --> 01:32:07.739
Oh, man, there is nothing finer...

01:32:07.905 --> 01:32:10.616
...than being behind the wheel
of your own car.

01:32:11.325 --> 01:32:13.911
Except, maybe, for pussy.

01:33:44.669 --> 01:33:46.254
Hey.

01:33:47.630 --> 01:33:50.049
It's kind of spooky in here, huh?

01:33:51.467 --> 01:33:54.178
Looks like they cleaned out
the whole place.

01:33:54.512 --> 01:33:56.347
Jesus.

01:33:58.933 --> 01:34:00.518
That's where he used to keep it.

01:34:01.352 --> 01:34:03.104
Down there.

01:34:03.271 --> 01:34:04.522
Yeah.

01:34:07.191 --> 01:34:08.776
We better get started.

01:34:30.673 --> 01:34:32.675
Yeah!

01:34:32.842 --> 01:34:34.594
What do you think?

01:34:36.262 --> 01:34:38.139
Let's try it.

01:35:27.355 --> 01:35:29.982
Christine's gonna come through the door.

01:35:32.026 --> 01:35:34.528
You better get in the office
and stay out of sight.

01:35:34.695 --> 01:35:38.741
Once she gets inside, hit the button
and bring the door down.

01:35:39.784 --> 01:35:41.702
Then we'll have her trapped.

01:35:42.245 --> 01:35:44.413
What if he doesn't come?

01:35:45.081 --> 01:35:46.874
Christine will.

01:36:14.527 --> 01:36:16.404
You better get in the office.

01:36:16.570 --> 01:36:18.656
Keep your head down.

01:36:20.116 --> 01:36:24.120
When you hear me start this thing up,
reach out and hit the button.

01:36:59.447 --> 01:37:00.614
Leigh!

01:38:06.389 --> 01:38:09.016
Leigh, don't move! Stay where you are!

01:38:43.509 --> 01:38:44.885
You shitters!

01:40:18.521 --> 01:40:19.605
Goddamn it.

01:40:19.772 --> 01:40:21.857
Fuck, what a mess.

01:41:56.327 --> 01:41:57.494
Arnie's dead.

01:42:11.216 --> 01:42:13.052
Leigh!

01:44:02.745 --> 01:44:04.663
Hey, are you okay?

01:44:05.497 --> 01:44:07.332
I think so.

01:44:11.003 --> 01:44:12.629
No.

01:45:28.372 --> 01:45:32.334
I wouldn't feel so bad if I were you.
You two are heroes, you know.

01:45:32.501 --> 01:45:33.961
Yeah.

01:45:34.127 --> 01:45:36.797
A real hero could have saved Arnie.

01:45:36.964 --> 01:45:38.924
We didn't do so hot.

01:45:39.091 --> 01:45:41.552
Hey, some things can't be helped.

01:45:41.718 --> 01:45:43.637
Some people too.

01:45:44.012 --> 01:45:45.556
Yeah.

01:46:03.949 --> 01:46:06.451
God, I hate rock 'n' roll.
