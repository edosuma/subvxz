WEBVTT

00:04.743 --> 00:06.223
Tell me what happened, man.

00:06.267 --> 00:07.659
The gun jammed.

00:07.703 --> 00:09.661
It's the only reason
I'm alive right now.

00:09.705 --> 00:11.794
It didn't go off, man,
because it's not your time.

00:11.837 --> 00:13.883
It can't be that simple.

00:13.926 --> 00:15.319
It's Casey.

00:15.363 --> 00:17.060
He had a really bad call
this morning.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.801
Well, I won't pretend
I understand

00:18.844 --> 00:20.194
what it feels like
to be shot at.

00:20.237 --> 00:22.152
Then how did you know
II was shot at?

00:22.196 --> 00:24.502
Brett mentioned it
to me yesterday.

00:24.546 --> 00:28.985
I think it's a bad idea,
dwelling on things.

00:29.594 --> 00:31.292
I'm here to counsel
rescue workers.

00:31.335 --> 00:33.033
By dating a colleague,

00:33.076 --> 00:34.730
there's no inherent sense
of trust.

00:34.773 --> 00:36.514
I can't see you anymore.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:48.048 --> 00:49.310
Good morning!

00:49.353 --> 00:50.833
You know what this is, Brett?

00:50.876 --> 00:54.228
This is your social calendar
for the rest of the week.

00:56.143 --> 00:57.970
Tomorrow night, Top Golf!

00:58.014 --> 00:59.320
Friday is Prime and Provisions.

00:59.363 --> 01:00.538
Saturday Shift.

01:00.582 --> 01:02.714
But Sunday, well,
Molly's of course,

01:02.758 --> 01:05.543
but after that, there is a
"My Neighbor Totoro" screening

01:05.587 --> 01:06.805
at the Siskel.

01:06.849 --> 01:08.111
Now.

01:08.155 --> 01:09.393
You guys really don't
have to do this.

01:09.417 --> 01:10.896
Nah! You have no say.

01:10.940 --> 01:12.333
You are our roomdog

01:12.376 --> 01:14.224
and you are stuck with us
for the rest of the week.

01:14.248 --> 01:16.946
Now get up, get dressed,
and get in the car

01:16.989 --> 01:19.949
'cause we are getting pancakes
at the Palace before shift!

01:19.992 --> 01:21.646
Palace pancakes! Whoo!

01:21.690 --> 01:22.690
Fine. Thank you.

01:35.704 --> 01:37.793
Okay, let's see.

01:37.836 --> 01:40.317
Kidd, Zvonacek, Capp, Cruz,

01:40.361 --> 01:42.580
your CPR certification is up.

01:42.624 --> 01:44.408
Get me renewal cards
in the next two weeks

01:44.452 --> 01:46.149
or you and I will have words.

01:48.151 --> 01:49.457
Get it done.

01:50.414 --> 01:52.634
Okay, let's get out there and...

01:52.677 --> 01:55.767
- Hey!
- Yes, Lieutenant Herrmann.

01:55.811 --> 01:57.247
Okay, thank you.

01:57.291 --> 01:59.162
Um, so as some of you know,

01:59.206 --> 02:02.122
Cindy gave up her career
when we got married

02:02.165 --> 02:04.776
and started a family
16 years ago.

02:04.820 --> 02:07.736
- What was her career?
- Interior design.

02:07.779 --> 02:08.780
Really?

02:08.824 --> 02:10.130
Really really.

02:10.173 --> 02:12.654
Now that our youngest is
in kindergarten,

02:12.697 --> 02:15.657
um, she has decided she wanted
to start it back up.

02:15.700 --> 02:21.228
So she has generously
offered to...

02:21.271 --> 02:23.491
redesign the common room.

02:23.534 --> 02:25.188
No, no, no, no, no, no.

02:27.016 --> 02:29.627
- I'm sorry, that's just...
- Nownow listen!

02:29.671 --> 02:32.717
You justjustdon't dig in,
be open to change,

02:32.761 --> 02:35.329
and let's justlet's just
help her out, all right?

02:35.372 --> 02:37.809
You're the most un-open
to change person

02:37.853 --> 02:39.898
in the entire CFD!

02:39.942 --> 02:41.639
Engine 51, Truck 81, Squad 3...

02:41.683 --> 02:43.815
Okay, let's go, let's go,
let's go!

02:43.859 --> 02:46.905
Apartment Fire,
483 West Armitage.

02:52.346 --> 02:54.174
All right, looks like
this one's cooking.

02:54.217 --> 02:55.740
We're going to work, boys.

02:55.784 --> 02:57.307
Hydrant's blocked, Lieutenant.

03:00.310 --> 03:02.834
All right, hey.
Let's park over there.

03:02.878 --> 03:04.488
We'll tie it into that hydrant.

03:04.532 --> 03:07.317
We're going to have to hose
across the street.

03:14.368 --> 03:16.500
Looks like we got 20
to 24 units.

03:16.544 --> 03:18.241
Fire's concentrated in the back.

03:18.285 --> 03:19.721
We'll take the fire floor.

03:19.764 --> 03:22.854
Kidd, go with squad.
We'll clear below.

03:22.898 --> 03:24.508
Hey!

03:24.552 --> 03:26.728
What was that?
Sorry, I was parking.

03:26.771 --> 03:28.164
Follow us in.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.644
Hey, Ritter! You're with truck!

03:29.687 --> 03:31.863
Clarence, grab another
inch and 3/4 line.

03:31.907 --> 03:33.517
We'll support squad. Copy that.

03:33.561 --> 03:35.127
Copy, Lieutenant.

03:44.180 --> 03:45.747
Hey!

03:48.619 --> 03:50.273
- Hey, man, you okay?
- Hey, come on.

03:50.317 --> 03:52.536
The hell, Herrmann?

03:52.580 --> 03:54.103
Dragging lines
across the street?

03:54.146 --> 03:56.192
Nah, Captain, the hydrant
was blocked so we just...

03:56.236 --> 03:57.933
You just put this rescue
in jeopardy!

04:09.684 --> 04:11.468
Ritter, you okay?

04:11.512 --> 04:12.967
- It's my shoulder.
- Get it checked out.

04:12.991 --> 04:14.428
We still need a line
in this fire!

04:14.471 --> 04:15.994
All right.

04:16.038 --> 04:17.885
Clarence, Jesse, get
the slack out of this line.

04:17.909 --> 04:19.998
Let's go. Hey, listen.

04:20.041 --> 04:22.871
This is on me.
Go get yourself checked.

04:22.914 --> 04:27.745
Go. You too, cover the left.
Let's get some water on it.

04:27.789 --> 04:29.704
Fire department, call out!

04:29.747 --> 04:31.009
Go, go, go, go!

04:31.053 --> 04:34.143
Fire department!

04:34.186 --> 04:36.058
Fire department, call out!

04:38.669 --> 04:40.497
Call out!

04:45.807 --> 04:47.939
Ma'am! You okay?

04:47.983 --> 04:49.724
I left my soldering iron on.

04:49.767 --> 04:51.334
I went to wash my paint brushes.

04:51.378 --> 04:53.423
Everything went up so fast.
Is anyone else here?

04:53.467 --> 04:55.773
No, it's just me,
but the neighbors!

04:55.817 --> 04:57.097
We'll get them! Just stay down!

05:03.868 --> 05:05.870
Fire department, call out!

05:30.112 --> 05:32.027
Kidd, let's go!

05:32.070 --> 05:33.376
Engine's gonna hit the fire.

05:33.420 --> 05:34.682
Copy.

05:58.053 --> 06:00.316
Hey! Hey, what the hell
are you doing?

06:00.360 --> 06:01.622
- I don't...
- Let's go!

06:01.665 --> 06:03.580
- All right!
- Move it!

06:14.286 --> 06:16.593
- Take care.
- Thank you so much.

06:18.769 --> 06:22.033
Lady had a real arts and crafts
fest going on in her apartment.

06:22.077 --> 06:24.427
Left the soldering iron
burning near paint cans.

06:40.138 --> 06:41.792
Fire's knocked out, Chief.

06:41.836 --> 06:45.317
You know what a good engine
lieutenant does, Herrmann?

06:45.361 --> 06:47.102
He doesn't add to the incident.

06:47.145 --> 06:48.582
Ritter's on his way
to Med right now

06:48.625 --> 06:49.844
because of where you parked.

06:49.887 --> 06:51.454
Who knows when he'll be back?

06:51.498 --> 06:55.110
Okay, Truck 87, Engine 90.
You're up on overhaul.

06:55.153 --> 06:56.503
Copy that, chief.

06:56.546 --> 06:58.853
Chief, I got to get back
in there.

06:58.896 --> 07:00.289
I got to... Kidd, you heard him.

07:00.332 --> 07:03.031
Pack the rigs! Follow orders!

07:28.622 --> 07:30.232
There she is.

07:30.841 --> 07:31.973
- Cindy!
- Hey, Cindy.

07:32.016 --> 07:34.062
Hey, fellas.

07:34.105 --> 07:35.716
Hey, honey.

07:35.759 --> 07:36.978
What's wrong?

07:37.021 --> 07:41.069
Nothing, it... it's just, um...

07:41.112 --> 07:44.289
maybe it's not such
a good day to do this whole

07:44.333 --> 07:47.379
interior design rigamarole.

07:51.166 --> 07:54.212
Yeah, no. I understand.

07:56.258 --> 07:58.303
Y-you know what? No.

07:58.347 --> 08:01.524
We wait for the ideal time
at a firehouse,

08:01.568 --> 08:03.308
we're gonna be waiting all year.

08:03.352 --> 08:06.398
So forget what I said,
all right?

08:06.442 --> 08:08.183
You go ahead

08:08.226 --> 08:11.839
and you do what you came here
to do.

08:11.882 --> 08:14.015
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:14.058 --> 08:16.191
Great!

08:16.234 --> 08:18.236
Okay.

08:33.121 --> 08:35.035
You wanted to see me, Chief?

08:35.078 --> 08:36.690
Yeah, close the door.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.217
Is there any particular reason

08:42.260 --> 08:44.020
you lit up Herrmann so badly
at the incident?

08:44.044 --> 08:47.396
Engine 51 was not
positioned correctly.

08:47.439 --> 08:49.398
Hoses should not have been
crossing the street

08:49.441 --> 08:51.400
or the street
should've been secured.

08:51.443 --> 08:54.490
Either way, that's on Herrmann.

08:56.274 --> 09:01.584
And you're sure that
it's not something else?

09:02.629 --> 09:05.240
Sometimes being Captain
means having to be hard

09:05.283 --> 09:06.937
on the firefighters
underneath me.

09:06.981 --> 09:08.678
You taught me that.

09:09.810 --> 09:13.465
Even when those firefighters
are best friends with my chief.

09:20.298 --> 09:22.257
Fair enough.

09:22.866 --> 09:24.607
Dismissed.

09:34.661 --> 09:36.010
He's not wrong.

09:36.053 --> 09:38.142
And that is not how Casey
behaves at a scene.

09:38.186 --> 09:40.057
So neither am I.

09:41.972 --> 09:43.626
- Chief.
- Yeah.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.541
Um...

09:45.585 --> 09:48.631
I saw something in
the apartment building

09:48.675 --> 09:50.328
on our last call.

09:50.372 --> 09:54.681
There was this secret room
inside one of the apartments.

09:54.724 --> 09:57.335
Um, there were two beds.

09:58.685 --> 10:00.469
I just got a bad hit,

10:00.512 --> 10:03.646
like it might be some kind of
child endangerment deal.

10:03.690 --> 10:06.344
I was thinking I might call CPD.

10:07.258 --> 10:08.825
That's a good idea.

10:08.869 --> 10:11.045
That's for letting me know.
Keep me in the loop.

10:11.088 --> 10:13.308
- Will do, Chief.
- Go ahead.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.661
That room I pulled you out of?

10:18.705 --> 10:19.923
Yeah.

10:19.967 --> 10:21.969
Are you sure it wasn't
a club house, a fort?

10:22.012 --> 10:23.361
You know how kids are.

10:23.405 --> 10:24.798
No, I don't think so.

10:24.841 --> 10:26.756
I mean, this was creepy.

10:27.975 --> 10:29.672
Well, go with your gut then.

10:40.944 --> 10:42.511
So Cindy,

10:42.554 --> 10:44.818
what kind of style are you
thinking about here?

10:44.861 --> 10:47.516
Well, what I like to do
is take in the room

10:47.559 --> 10:49.474
and see how it speaks to me.

10:50.258 --> 10:51.607
Is it organically imperfect?

10:51.651 --> 10:53.565
Should I go for
a maximalist approach?

10:53.609 --> 10:56.612
Is personality paramount
or should I scale back

10:56.656 --> 10:59.484
with more of
a new traditional patina?

11:00.181 --> 11:02.705
Okay, thank you.

11:05.229 --> 11:07.014
Guys?

11:07.057 --> 11:10.104
I want to gather all of
your input, one at a time,

11:10.147 --> 11:11.758
where you can speak freely

11:11.801 --> 11:14.717
and openly about what
this room means to you.

11:14.761 --> 11:17.067
That'll help me
center my design.

11:17.111 --> 11:18.286
Sound good?

11:18.329 --> 11:19.548
- Absolutely.
- Yeah, sure.

11:19.591 --> 11:21.463
- Great.
- Can't wait.

11:21.506 --> 11:23.595
First and foremost is the couch.

11:23.639 --> 11:27.730
Now I'm not saying this
one can't be improved upon

11:27.774 --> 11:31.081
but this one cannot be
improved upon.

11:31.125 --> 11:32.648
That couch has got to go.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.737
Don't get me started
on these chairs, okay?

11:34.781 --> 11:37.392
It's like sitting on sandpaper.

11:38.872 --> 11:40.917
I'm just going to go ahead
and say it.

11:40.961 --> 11:45.139
This place was made
for men by men.

11:45.182 --> 11:47.402
It's, like, 1987 in here.

11:47.445 --> 11:49.230
Maybe a game's cabinet

11:49.273 --> 11:51.406
or a dart board.

11:51.449 --> 11:52.450
Ooh, or a shuffleboard.

11:52.494 --> 11:54.104
Or both!

11:54.148 --> 11:56.803
I have always said
this place can be functional

11:56.846 --> 11:58.848
but look like adult's work here.

12:00.415 --> 12:01.982
I don't care what you do.

12:03.374 --> 12:06.160
Also if you need
an assistant, like a...

12:06.203 --> 12:08.466
Like a sous-chef, I'm your girl.

12:09.685 --> 12:11.469
I need this right now.

12:12.514 --> 12:14.734
Seriously,
don't touch the couch.

12:47.375 --> 12:48.463
Stella.

12:48.506 --> 12:49.943
- Hey!
- Hey.

12:50.987 --> 12:53.076
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah, of course.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.338
What's going on?

12:54.382 --> 12:57.472
So, we were on
a call this morning.

12:57.515 --> 12:59.648
I moved the couch away
from a wall

12:59.691 --> 13:00.954
and I saw this little door

13:00.997 --> 13:04.566
and, I was about to leave but...

13:04.609 --> 13:06.742
I mean, I just got
this feeling, you know?

13:06.786 --> 13:11.051
So I opened it and it was,
like, a secret room.

13:11.094 --> 13:14.837
There were, like, a couple
of plates of half-eaten food

13:14.881 --> 13:20.538
and this was on
the outside of the door.

13:21.191 --> 13:23.846
So, anyway, I...

13:23.890 --> 13:25.979
Look, I'm telling you that
something bad was going on

13:26.022 --> 13:27.589
in that apartment.

13:27.632 --> 13:29.156
Stella has great instincts.

13:29.199 --> 13:31.419
If she thinks there was
something bad going on,

13:31.462 --> 13:33.464
then there was.

13:35.379 --> 13:37.120
Can you show me the site?

13:38.165 --> 13:39.731
Casey!

13:39.775 --> 13:41.622
Hey, can I show Upton
the site from this morning?

13:41.646 --> 13:43.083
What's going on?

13:43.126 --> 13:45.346
We think there might've been
some child endangerment

13:45.389 --> 13:47.435
situation in the last room
we searched.

13:47.478 --> 13:49.480
Yeah, I just want to show her
what I saw

13:49.524 --> 13:52.396
and then we'll
leave it up to her from there.

13:55.051 --> 13:56.792
Yeah, of course.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.795
Keep your radio on, we'll come
pick you up if we get a call.

13:59.839 --> 14:00.752
All right.

14:00.796 --> 14:02.232
- Ride with me?
- Yeah.

14:08.108 --> 14:09.587
Okay, it was right...

14:17.987 --> 14:19.206
Right here.

14:20.772 --> 14:24.689
Damn it, lit's gone.

14:24.733 --> 14:28.215
But itit was here.
I didn't make it up.

14:28.258 --> 14:30.695
Okay...

14:31.609 --> 14:34.612
Well, I'll call
the building owner

14:34.656 --> 14:37.398
and I'll follow up with whoever
was renting the unit

14:37.441 --> 14:38.834
but I've got to be honest,

14:38.878 --> 14:40.792
there's no evidence
of a crime here.

14:40.836 --> 14:42.490
Look, II realize...

14:42.533 --> 14:44.405
You didn't witness
any wrongdoing either.

14:46.407 --> 14:48.104
Okay.

14:48.148 --> 14:49.758
Look, I'm sympathetic. I am.

14:49.801 --> 14:51.064
I follow my instincts too.

14:51.107 --> 14:52.456
I have my whole career

14:52.500 --> 14:54.894
but without a crime,
much less a victim,

14:54.937 --> 14:57.026
I'm a little behind
the eight ball.

14:58.158 --> 15:00.029
I understand.

15:00.073 --> 15:01.944
You'll follow up though?

15:01.988 --> 15:03.380
Yeah.

15:03.424 --> 15:05.489
I'll let you know as soon as
I have anything to report.

15:05.513 --> 15:06.993
Thank you.

15:18.787 --> 15:20.354
Thanks.

15:25.881 --> 15:27.143
Kelly.

15:28.536 --> 15:32.670
Thank you, you know, for...
For supporting me today.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.545
Anytime.

15:50.384 --> 15:51.994
- Ritter.
- Captain.

15:52.038 --> 15:55.606
Hey, just, came to tell Herrmann

15:55.650 --> 15:58.479
you know, it's a sprain,
gonna be fine.

15:58.522 --> 16:01.221
The doctor's saying to rest
it a couple of shifts but...

16:01.264 --> 16:03.136
No problem. Go home.

16:03.179 --> 16:05.225
But should I tell Herrmann?

16:05.268 --> 16:08.445
- I'll tell him.
- Okay.

16:08.489 --> 16:11.579
Captain, just so you know,

16:11.622 --> 16:14.538
there was a vehicle completely
blocking the nearest hydrant

16:14.582 --> 16:16.801
and things were happening fast
and, you know,

16:16.845 --> 16:19.456
Herrmann just wanted
to make sure you had support

16:19.500 --> 16:21.763
before you rushed into
the building.

16:25.593 --> 16:27.464
Got it.

16:28.596 --> 16:30.511
Okay.

16:36.821 --> 16:38.780
Are you asking
first and third shifts

16:38.823 --> 16:40.129
their opinions too, Cindy?

16:40.173 --> 16:41.870
If I have time.

16:42.610 --> 16:45.004
Is there some kind of
pressing time limit?

16:45.047 --> 16:46.111
Christopher didn't tell you?

16:46.135 --> 16:47.180
Nah.

16:47.223 --> 16:48.572
My friend Gwen,

16:48.616 --> 16:50.357
her daughter works
for Chicago Home Spread.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.098
No way!

16:52.141 --> 16:53.708
That's my favorite magazine.

16:53.751 --> 16:55.971
Their centerfolds are legendary.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.843
They're going to do
a photo shoot this Saturday.

16:59.496 --> 17:01.194
That's our next shift.

17:01.237 --> 17:02.978
Exactly.

17:06.025 --> 17:09.070
Um, hey, honey.

17:09.115 --> 17:12.074
I was just thinking, um,

17:12.117 --> 17:13.815
you know, our family room...

17:13.858 --> 17:16.992
It hasn't been upgraded in
I don't know how long.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.646
But maybe we shouldl'm just,

17:18.689 --> 17:20.778
you know,
thinking out loud here,

17:20.821 --> 17:23.607
but, maybe
we should start there.

17:24.652 --> 17:26.001
Well, honey,

17:26.045 --> 17:28.612
while I think that's
a great idea for down the road,

17:28.656 --> 17:31.311
my friend Gwen has already
pitched this

17:31.354 --> 17:33.269
as a firehouse makeover.

17:33.313 --> 17:35.315
So I think I should stick
to Plan A.

17:35.358 --> 17:38.666
Right. No, totally.

17:38.709 --> 17:40.668
Herrmann,
Boden is looking for you.

17:45.194 --> 17:48.110
Chief.

17:48.154 --> 17:49.764
Hey, Herrmann.

17:49.807 --> 17:52.003
Just wanted to let you know
that Ritter is going to be

17:52.027 --> 17:53.202
out a couple of shifts,

17:53.246 --> 17:54.484
so 51 is going to need
a floater.

17:54.508 --> 17:56.684
All right, what's the prognosis?

17:56.727 --> 17:58.686
Minor sprain but
the doctors said to rest it.

17:58.729 --> 18:00.731
All right, well,
that's good at least.

18:00.775 --> 18:03.604
Um, I'll take,
a look at the floater pool

18:03.647 --> 18:05.171
and see if any names stick out.

18:05.214 --> 18:08.783
Casey's already selected
someone named Klinginpill.

18:11.351 --> 18:13.309
Casey selected.

18:16.007 --> 18:17.183
Isn't the engine lieutenant

18:17.226 --> 18:20.011
supposed to pick his floater
replacement?

18:31.936 --> 18:33.808
Captain!

18:33.851 --> 18:35.766
Maybe I heard wrong,

18:35.810 --> 18:38.900
but, Boden was telling me
that you picked a floater

18:38.943 --> 18:40.684
for Ritter's spot on Engine.

18:40.728 --> 18:42.488
Yeah, Ritter's gonna be out
a couple of shifts

18:42.512 --> 18:44.558
so I expedited the process.

18:44.601 --> 18:46.995
There were a bunch of reserves
on there, I chose one.

18:48.257 --> 18:50.390
That's engine lieutenant's job.

18:52.261 --> 18:55.221
Well, I guess
I helped you out then.

18:55.264 --> 18:57.788
You didn't actually.

18:59.442 --> 19:01.488
You picked Kevin Klinginpill,

19:01.531 --> 19:05.100
who I happen to know is
a loafer who got booted off

19:05.144 --> 19:07.363
of Engine 77 six months ago

19:07.407 --> 19:09.278
and you know how I know that?

19:09.322 --> 19:12.281
I called around
and actually did my homework.

19:12.325 --> 19:13.500
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

19:13.543 --> 19:15.284
Is there a problem here?

19:19.810 --> 19:21.943
Nah, Chief.

19:25.773 --> 19:28.297
An engine lieutenant
popping off to a Captain

19:28.341 --> 19:31.082
in any other house
would be written up.

19:46.837 --> 19:48.404
Hey.

19:48.448 --> 19:50.450
- Hey!
- I have an update.

19:50.493 --> 19:51.625
Okay.

19:51.668 --> 19:53.148
So I talked to the owner

19:53.192 --> 19:55.324
from the burnt out apartment
building, Kira Anderson.

19:55.368 --> 19:56.673
She uses a management company

19:56.717 --> 19:58.414
to rent out and maintain
the apartments.

19:58.458 --> 20:01.243
The management company
is Pine Grove Consulting.

20:01.287 --> 20:04.159
They said unit 106 was rented
out by a Mike Nunez

20:04.203 --> 20:06.509
but he left unexpectedly
about a month ago.

20:06.553 --> 20:08.163
Do they have
a forwarding address?

20:08.207 --> 20:10.209
No and he paid all
his rent in cash.

20:10.252 --> 20:12.298
I ran the name Mike Nunez
through the system

20:12.341 --> 20:13.666
and no one matches
the description.

20:13.690 --> 20:15.475
Pine Grove gave us
of the tenant.

20:15.518 --> 20:16.998
So a dead end.

20:17.041 --> 20:18.826
Basically.

20:18.869 --> 20:20.131
Look, I'm not saying

20:20.175 --> 20:21.587
nothing ever happened
in that apartment.

20:21.611 --> 20:23.004
I'm just saying realistically,

20:23.047 --> 20:24.484
we might not ever know what did.

20:24.527 --> 20:27.487
I've taken this as far
as I can go. I'm sorry.

20:27.530 --> 20:30.316
No, thank you for,
for helping out.

20:30.359 --> 20:31.839
Yeah, appreciate it.

20:31.882 --> 20:33.232
You go it. Anytime.

20:39.890 --> 20:41.501
The thing about a set floor plan

20:41.544 --> 20:43.242
and not being able
to move a wall

20:43.285 --> 20:46.462
is you have to work
within the space.

20:48.334 --> 20:52.033
Unless I could move a wall.

20:52.076 --> 20:53.817
Like between the common room

20:53.861 --> 20:55.166
and the briefing room,

20:55.210 --> 20:57.430
that would really
open up the space.

21:04.741 --> 21:08.179
I thought maybe we
could do something like this?

21:08.223 --> 21:10.269
Sure. Yeah.

21:10.312 --> 21:11.792
Christopher.

21:12.793 --> 21:13.837
What?

21:19.190 --> 21:21.280
Hey.

21:21.323 --> 21:22.585
Hey, you got a minute?

21:22.629 --> 21:24.544
Of course, Chief,
come on. Come on.

21:24.587 --> 21:27.242
Hey, you need a beer
or something?

21:27.286 --> 21:29.462
- Yeah, sure.
- All right.

21:32.116 --> 21:34.075
So what can I do for you?

21:34.118 --> 21:37.252
You know, I just thought I'd
come in and check in on you.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.949
Yeah.

21:38.993 --> 21:41.038
All good.

21:41.082 --> 21:42.649
Long shift.

21:42.692 --> 21:44.738
Yeah, I know.

21:47.871 --> 21:49.830
All right, fine.

21:49.873 --> 21:51.658
Look, here's the deal.

21:51.701 --> 21:55.488
See, I was mad at myself
the moment that that numbnuts

21:55.531 --> 21:59.143
ran over the hose and it got
yanked out of Ritter's hand.

21:59.187 --> 22:01.276
I realized that I'd screwed up

22:01.320 --> 22:03.626
but I didn't need to hear it
from Casey.

22:03.670 --> 22:06.803
I was already beating
myself up plenty. Trust me.

22:06.847 --> 22:08.588
Look, I'm not going to betray
a confidence

22:08.631 --> 22:11.591
so I won't go into detail,
but...

22:11.634 --> 22:13.767
Casey's dealing
with more than you know.

22:16.813 --> 22:19.294
Is he all right?

22:19.338 --> 22:21.165
He'll get there.

22:21.209 --> 22:23.298
And there I go,
making things worse so...

22:23.342 --> 22:25.474
See, the thing you have to
realize, Herrmann,

22:25.518 --> 22:27.607
unless you are
the Fire Commissioner,

22:27.650 --> 22:29.304
there is always gonna be
someone above you

22:29.348 --> 22:30.914
to tell you when
you make a mistake.

22:30.958 --> 22:35.310
The part that you are
not thinking about...

22:35.354 --> 22:37.486
is all of your men on Engine

22:37.530 --> 22:41.360
who are looking at you to see
how you react to criticism.

22:41.403 --> 22:45.494
See, if you dressed down
Clarence or Ritter or Doherty,

22:45.538 --> 22:48.976
would you like one of them
to go walking off in a huff

22:49.019 --> 22:50.891
or mouth back at you?

22:50.934 --> 22:53.154
I see your point.

22:56.462 --> 23:00.335
I'll apologize
and I'll make it right.

23:02.032 --> 23:03.643
Wallace, get in here!

23:03.686 --> 23:05.819
I want to hear your thoughts
on layering.

23:06.950 --> 23:08.865
On what?

23:10.040 --> 23:13.174
Yeah, I'm coming!

23:13.217 --> 23:16.220
We should see if they wanna
play next Saturday instead.

23:16.264 --> 23:17.657
Yeah.

23:17.700 --> 23:20.311
Hey Stella,
I just thought of something.

23:21.704 --> 23:23.489
The woman who started the fire.

23:23.532 --> 23:26.753
She left a soldering iron on.
I think her name was Marylou.

23:26.796 --> 23:28.798
Anyway,
she was in apartment 104,

23:28.842 --> 23:29.973
right next to 106.

23:30.017 --> 23:31.457
What, you think
she's still at med?

23:31.497 --> 23:32.865
She had some heavy
smoke inhalation.

23:32.889 --> 23:34.649
They probably wanna keep her
there overnight.

23:34.674 --> 23:36.719
Maybe she knows something
about her neighbors.

23:36.763 --> 23:38.547
It's worth a shot.

23:41.289 --> 23:45.380
I feel awful, just awful.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.513
I have an arts and crafts
summer session

23:47.556 --> 23:49.253
I teach in Wicker Park

23:49.297 --> 23:52.779
and I always say be safe,
be safe, be safe.

23:52.822 --> 23:54.650
Marylou, we're not here
about the fire.

23:55.782 --> 23:57.348
We're interested
in your neighbor.

23:57.392 --> 23:59.742
Mike Nunez. 106.
Did you know him?

23:59.786 --> 24:04.530
Um, sort of.
He had more than one name.

24:05.313 --> 24:06.532
What does that mean?

24:06.575 --> 24:08.751
Well, he'd get mail with
different names

24:08.795 --> 24:10.318
sent to his address.

24:10.361 --> 24:14.061
The Mike was the same but the
last names would be different.

24:14.104 --> 24:16.759
I remember because I was
holding some mail for him

24:16.803 --> 24:18.500
which he never
came back to pick up.

24:18.544 --> 24:20.284
So theythey're still
in your apartment?

24:20.328 --> 24:22.069
A few envelopes, yeah.

24:22.112 --> 24:26.334
If the fire didn't get to
the bureau near my front door,

24:26.377 --> 24:29.729
then it should be
in the top left drawer.

24:32.427 --> 24:33.602
Thank you.

24:33.646 --> 24:35.561
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you.

24:36.300 --> 24:38.999
Um, Marylou,

24:39.042 --> 24:40.914
did Mike have any kids?

24:40.957 --> 24:45.092
I think his sister had some
that he would watch sometimes.

24:45.135 --> 24:46.659
That's what he told me.

24:46.702 --> 24:50.097
I didn't really see them very
often, I heard them sometimes.

24:50.140 --> 24:51.707
He wasn't there very long.

24:52.578 --> 24:54.449
Thank you.

25:02.544 --> 25:04.981
Michael Nolasco.

25:05.025 --> 25:06.461
Michael Nunez.

25:08.419 --> 25:10.596
Michael Nuevavillegas.

25:10.639 --> 25:12.639
Look it, this one's from
Child Protective Services.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.038
I mean, it's basically open.

25:23.130 --> 25:24.610
"Dear Mr. Nuevavillegas,"

25:24.653 --> 25:26.481
your application
to provide a home

25:26.525 --> 25:29.571
"for additional children
has been accepted."

25:29.615 --> 25:31.530
What if this...

25:31.573 --> 25:34.315
What if this bastard was taking
in foster kids,

25:34.358 --> 25:36.099
cramming them into that tiny
room

25:36.143 --> 25:38.058
and then cashing out on
the government handouts?

25:39.886 --> 25:41.931
What?

25:41.975 --> 25:44.107
Hey, Detective,
this is Kelly Severide,

25:44.151 --> 25:45.805
give me a call back
when you get a chance.

25:45.848 --> 25:49.460
The man living in 106
was Michael Nuevavillegas.

25:49.504 --> 25:53.856
V-I-double L-E-G-A-S.

25:53.900 --> 25:55.249
It's all one word.

25:55.292 --> 25:56.598
We Google searched him

25:56.642 --> 25:58.513
and there's
a Michael Nuevavillegas

25:58.557 --> 25:59.514
who's listed in Pilsen.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.081
Which is where we're going.

26:01.124 --> 26:03.039
Anyway, call us back.

26:14.703 --> 26:16.531
Michael Nuevavillegas?

26:16.575 --> 26:17.837
Yeah?

26:17.880 --> 26:20.143
Hi, we're with
the Chicago Fire Department.

26:20.187 --> 26:24.191
Got word there's a gas leak
in your place.

26:24.234 --> 26:26.454
- Nah, there's no gas leak.
- Well, no. Therehey!

26:26.497 --> 26:28.021
That's the thing about
gas leaks.

26:28.064 --> 26:30.676
If you don't have the proper
carbon monoxide detectors,

26:30.719 --> 26:32.503
you won't know they're there.

26:32.547 --> 26:33.742
Just gotta peek
at your supply lines

26:33.766 --> 26:37.073
and we'll be out of your hair.

26:37.117 --> 26:39.989
How long have you lived here?
Not long, I guess.

26:40.033 --> 26:43.297
Hey, look, you're going to
have to come back another time.

26:43.340 --> 26:46.866
We would but, you know,
you don't own the building

26:46.909 --> 26:49.651
and the building owner,
Mrs. Anderson,

26:49.695 --> 26:51.653
she's the one who called us.

26:55.701 --> 26:59.052
Okay, you know what?
I'm getting a headache.

26:59.095 --> 27:01.358
Could be this gas leak,
like you said.

27:01.402 --> 27:03.926
There's a drug store down the
block and I'm outta aspirin.

27:03.970 --> 27:06.276
No, no, no. You got to stay
here until we're done.

27:17.592 --> 27:19.028
Kelly!

27:31.432 --> 27:34.609
Chicago PD! Hey, hey!

27:34.653 --> 27:35.784
Turn around!

27:35.828 --> 27:37.917
Get down!

27:37.960 --> 27:39.309
Put your hands behind your back.

27:39.353 --> 27:40.722
They came into my house!
Arrest them!

27:40.746 --> 27:43.183
- Shut up.
- This is Chicago brutality!

27:43.226 --> 27:45.011
Yeah, you bet it is.

27:49.058 --> 27:50.625
Okay.

28:01.984 --> 28:04.639
It's okay. Come on.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.728
Come on, it's safe.

28:06.772 --> 28:08.730
Come on out.

28:08.774 --> 28:11.037
Yeah.

28:11.080 --> 28:13.692
Come on.
Let's get you out of here.

28:13.735 --> 28:14.910
Come on.

28:14.954 --> 28:19.045
It's okay. I'm a firefighter.
You're safe.

28:19.088 --> 28:21.351
Hi, hi.

28:21.395 --> 28:24.572
5021 Henry, I need to roll
a squad, paramedics,

28:24.615 --> 28:27.836
and CPS to 1955 South Throop.

28:27.880 --> 28:30.143
Come on, get up.

28:30.186 --> 28:31.586
You have the right
to remain silent,

28:31.622 --> 28:33.059
you have the right
to an attorney.

28:33.102 --> 28:34.669
If you choose to give up
those rights,

28:34.713 --> 28:36.758
I'd be happy to smash
your face against the wall.

28:37.933 --> 28:39.084
You're okay. You're safe now.

28:39.108 --> 28:40.762
It's okay.

28:50.119 --> 28:51.773
Civilians in the outside world,

28:51.817 --> 28:55.298
they think that we wear our
badges on our dress uniforms

28:55.342 --> 28:58.911
or we just carry them around
in our pockets

28:58.954 --> 29:01.609
but unless you have done
this job,

29:01.652 --> 29:04.830
you can't see where we really
wear our firefighter badges

29:04.873 --> 29:07.223
and it's right here.

29:07.267 --> 29:08.659
Our hearts.

29:08.703 --> 29:11.793
And that spirit
was demonstrated off duty,

29:11.837 --> 29:16.232
off shift this weekend
by our very own Stella Kidd.

29:17.407 --> 29:20.497
For those of you
who do not know,

29:20.541 --> 29:22.804
Kidd identified potential
criminal activity

29:22.848 --> 29:25.415
during our last fire

29:25.459 --> 29:30.377
and now there is a boy
and girl who are...

29:30.420 --> 29:33.772
safe due to your efforts.

29:34.773 --> 29:37.819
Stella Kidd,
that is wonderful work

29:37.863 --> 29:42.519
and we should all look
to your example.

29:57.708 --> 29:59.058
Hey, Captain.

29:59.101 --> 30:00.537
Hey listen, about last shift...

30:00.581 --> 30:02.322
Hey, you, you Herrmann?

30:02.365 --> 30:03.714
- Lieutenant.
- Yeah, what I said.

30:03.758 --> 30:04.846
No you didn't.

30:04.890 --> 30:06.456
Look, we're having
a conversation here.

30:06.500 --> 30:07.893
Yeah, sure, but listen.

30:07.936 --> 30:10.852
I had to roll hoses the last
two shifts at 29 and 74.

30:10.896 --> 30:13.246
All things considered,
I prefer not to do it here.

30:13.289 --> 30:15.857
Klinginpill, he just told you
we're trying to talk here.

30:15.901 --> 30:17.511
II get it, Captain,

30:17.554 --> 30:19.358
but I've been drawing the
short straw everywhere I go.

30:19.382 --> 30:23.256
It's like just 'cause I gotta
float, I don't have any rights?

30:23.299 --> 30:25.824
What is this, medieval England?
What?

30:25.867 --> 30:28.174
I got photos I wanna put up
in my locker

30:28.217 --> 30:29.740
but I don't even have a locker.

30:29.784 --> 30:31.351
Locker photos?

30:31.394 --> 30:32.918
That's right, my mom, my dogs.

30:32.961 --> 30:35.200
Got one of my brother Ned who's
a hell of a fly fisherman.

30:35.224 --> 30:36.898
Herrmann, what were
you trying to tell me?

30:36.922 --> 30:38.488
Nah, forget it, Captain.

30:38.532 --> 30:39.857
I gotta go and figure out
a locker for, you know,

30:39.881 --> 30:42.579
- fill-and-spill.
- Klinginpill.

30:45.234 --> 30:47.367
Hey, where's the bunk room?

30:48.934 --> 30:50.283
Engine 51, Truck 81...

30:50.326 --> 30:51.980
Klinginpill,
you stay out of the way

30:52.024 --> 30:54.113
unless I give you an order.

31:14.698 --> 31:16.918
Brando, grab an extinguisher!

31:16.962 --> 31:18.920
Clarence, lead out.

31:18.964 --> 31:20.835
Copy that, lieutenant.

31:22.184 --> 31:24.056
Hey, we'll get you out,
buddy. Sit tight.

31:27.146 --> 31:28.451
Herrmann, what do we got?

31:28.495 --> 31:30.801
Hey, we got a driver
pinned inside.

31:30.845 --> 31:33.413
We're trying to knock down
these flames but they're tough!

31:33.456 --> 31:35.589
All right, 81,
let's get the driver out.

31:35.632 --> 31:37.286
- Copy.
- Cutter's jaws are cribbing.

31:41.203 --> 31:43.075
Get those flames out, Kaufmann.

31:43.118 --> 31:44.772
Copy.

31:47.601 --> 31:49.777
Get back! Herrmann,
get everyone back now!

31:49.820 --> 31:52.954
Yes, Captain. Get back!
Everybody back!

31:52.998 --> 31:54.390
What is it, Cap?

31:54.434 --> 31:55.977
Propane tanks in
the back of the truck!

31:56.001 --> 31:57.567
They're right in the flames!

31:57.611 --> 31:59.961
Klinginpill, get those
people off the corner! Go!

32:00.005 --> 32:02.746
- Okay, folks, you heard him!
- Get them off over there!

32:02.790 --> 32:05.010
Clarence,
grab another extinguisher.

32:05.053 --> 32:06.837
Go!

32:06.881 --> 32:08.665
Hurry, Mouch.

32:08.709 --> 32:10.667
- Mike, we tied in?
- No!

32:10.711 --> 32:12.974
- Sir!
- Otis, reverse!

32:14.715 --> 32:16.978
Go, go! Keep going!

32:42.395 --> 32:45.267
All right, boys,
let's put this fire out.

32:45.311 --> 32:46.877
Let's get the driver.

32:50.620 --> 32:51.708
Come on, buddy.

32:51.752 --> 32:53.972
I got you.

33:18.213 --> 33:19.519
Hey.

33:21.477 --> 33:22.565
What's up?

33:22.609 --> 33:24.306
Cindy's about to make
her big reveal.

33:24.350 --> 33:25.829
She told everyone to clear out.

33:25.873 --> 33:27.353
She blocked the windows.

33:27.396 --> 33:28.963
Sorry about this, Chief.

33:30.573 --> 33:32.227
Hey, real quick, Captain.

33:32.271 --> 33:33.794
I wanted to tell you about...
Okay!

33:33.837 --> 33:38.103
It may not be perfect,
but it is a statement.

33:39.147 --> 33:41.845
- That's what you want.
- Exactly.

33:41.889 --> 33:43.456
Come on!

34:08.829 --> 34:12.789
Well, I think it is amazing.

34:15.139 --> 34:18.012
- No.
- Okay, all right.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.232
Um...

34:22.495 --> 34:24.105
Yeah, um...

34:24.149 --> 34:26.411
Do something now.

34:26.455 --> 34:28.022
Yeah.

34:28.065 --> 34:30.347
It was a risk, but when the
voice in the back of my head

34:30.371 --> 34:33.766
would say tone it down,
I just had to shut it out.

34:35.246 --> 34:39.077
Hey, Cindy, can I,
talk to you for a sec?

34:39.120 --> 34:40.904
Be right back.

34:43.820 --> 34:45.822
Okay, listen.

34:45.866 --> 34:48.869
There is no good way
to say this,

34:48.911 --> 34:50.217
so I'm just gonna say it.

34:50.262 --> 34:53.003
Everybody here appreciates

34:53.047 --> 34:55.266
you wanting to get
your business going,

34:55.310 --> 34:59.401
but this...

34:59.445 --> 35:01.534
we all have to work here, Cindy.

35:01.577 --> 35:04.319
This is a functioning firehouse.

35:04.363 --> 35:07.061
Not some Salvador Dali
nightmare.

35:07.105 --> 35:10.282
- Well, I...
- Listen, hey, hey.

35:10.325 --> 35:12.022
You just don't have
an eye for this, babe.

35:12.066 --> 35:18.986
So, we are just going
to have to put everything back

35:19.029 --> 35:20.727
the way it was before.

35:21.945 --> 35:25.253
This was rented furniture
just for the photo shoot

35:25.297 --> 35:26.907
so I could break through
the clutter.

35:26.950 --> 35:30.606
It was going to go back
to normal.

35:30.650 --> 35:32.173
I didn't realize that.

35:32.217 --> 35:34.741
Because you didn't listen
when I told you last week.

35:35.785 --> 35:37.222
You did?

35:38.092 --> 35:40.529
I'ml'm just glad

35:40.573 --> 35:43.619
you've let me know
I don't have an eye for this.

35:43.663 --> 35:47.754
I'll have to rethink
my taste in everything.

35:53.629 --> 35:55.196
Boy.

35:59.766 --> 36:01.637
How'd it go?

36:01.681 --> 36:03.161
What do you think?

36:03.204 --> 36:04.553
But we'rewe're...

36:04.597 --> 36:06.686
We're getting our
furniture back, right?

36:08.905 --> 36:10.646
Excuse me, Mouch.

36:13.910 --> 36:16.217
Hey!

36:16.261 --> 36:19.568
I'm sorry it took so long
but I owe you an apology.

36:19.612 --> 36:21.309
I shouldn't have directed
the engine

36:21.353 --> 36:22.658
to that side of the street.

36:22.702 --> 36:25.400
You're right,
it was a bone-headed move,

36:25.444 --> 36:28.229
and I deserved you
coming down hard on me.

36:28.273 --> 36:29.883
It won't happen again.

36:31.058 --> 36:34.975
And I shouldn't have come
at you with both barrels.

36:35.018 --> 36:37.282
I'm sorry for that.

36:40.502 --> 36:42.809
I...

36:42.852 --> 36:46.900
I haven't been myself lately
but I'm working through it.

36:46.943 --> 36:48.249
I'll get there.

36:48.293 --> 36:50.382
All right, hey, we all take
our lumps.

36:50.425 --> 36:54.864
Mine are usually 'cause I open
my yap instead of my ears.

36:54.908 --> 36:56.475
I mean...

36:58.999 --> 37:01.001
Just ask Cindy.

37:01.044 --> 37:05.048
But anyway, I want you to know

37:05.092 --> 37:07.181
that I do not take it
for granted

37:07.225 --> 37:09.662
that you are
my superior officer.

37:11.054 --> 37:13.100
You know, I'm not a suck up

37:13.143 --> 37:19.280
but I have been lucky to watch
you operate

37:19.324 --> 37:21.935
for a good part of my career

37:21.978 --> 37:26.244
and I have learned from you
every single shift

37:27.114 --> 37:29.769
and I am damn proud
to serve under you.

37:35.949 --> 37:37.733
Thanks, Herrmann.

37:39.126 --> 37:41.476
I needed to hear that.

37:41.520 --> 37:43.783
Yeah.

37:43.826 --> 37:46.916
I'm glad my mouth was good
for something today.

38:03.890 --> 38:05.631
If I'm a little grouchy
tomorrow,

38:05.674 --> 38:07.328
it's because
Cindy's got me sleeping

38:07.372 --> 38:08.982
on the roll out bed again.

38:09.025 --> 38:11.811
Maybe she can get you
a deal on a new mattress.

38:12.899 --> 38:14.727
No? Not in the mood?

38:15.423 --> 38:16.990
Speaking of deals.

38:17.033 --> 38:19.340
We got the furniture company
to give us Cindy's couch

38:19.384 --> 38:20.559
for practically nothing.

38:20.602 --> 38:22.343
For the record,
I was against it.

38:22.387 --> 38:24.389
- No, you weren't!
- Shh.

38:28.393 --> 38:31.265
Get that thing out of here
before Cindy sees it!

38:31.309 --> 38:32.875
She thinks I'm
making fun of her,

38:32.919 --> 38:35.835
I'm in the dog house
for the rest of my life!

38:35.878 --> 38:38.098
I...

38:41.580 --> 38:43.233
- Thanks.
- Take your time.

38:43.277 --> 38:45.366
Where's my hospitality?

38:45.410 --> 38:47.237
Next round's on me.

38:47.281 --> 38:49.239
I'm moving to top shelf now.

38:49.283 --> 38:52.417
So it turns out that
Nuevavillegas guy

38:52.460 --> 38:54.854
has been running a foster care
scam for years.

38:54.897 --> 38:56.464
If you two wouldn't have
stepped up,

38:56.508 --> 38:58.442
who knows how long he would've
gotten away with it.

38:58.466 --> 38:59.902
It's all Stella.

38:59.946 --> 39:01.861
Um, whatwhat's going
to happen to the kids?

39:01.904 --> 39:03.558
They get put back in the system

39:03.602 --> 39:05.778
but their files have been
flagged for abuse.

39:05.821 --> 39:07.669
They'll end up in a much better
home with parents

39:07.693 --> 39:10.043
that are specially trained
to deal with at-risk kids.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.350
That's great.

39:12.393 --> 39:14.352
Yeah.

39:14.395 --> 39:16.745
Kid's names are Anton and Luna

39:16.789 --> 39:19.922
and they made these drawings
they wanted you to have.

39:27.713 --> 39:28.931
Thank you.

39:28.975 --> 39:30.193
Yeah, you got it.

39:30.237 --> 39:31.388
I got some friends
from District 25

39:31.412 --> 39:32.805
I'm going to say hi to

39:32.848 --> 39:34.608
but you guys aren't paying
for another drink.

39:34.633 --> 39:35.958
The rest of the night's
on me, okay?

39:35.982 --> 39:38.332
Hey, you won't hear me
complaining. Thanks.

39:38.376 --> 39:39.768
Yeah.

39:42.554 --> 39:43.990
You did a good thing.

39:45.513 --> 39:47.559
I think anyone would've done
the same in my shoes.

39:47.602 --> 39:52.085
Not so sure.

39:52.128 --> 39:53.956
There's no one like you.
