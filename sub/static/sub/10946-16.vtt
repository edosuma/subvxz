WEBVTT

00:00.486 --> 00:02.280
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:02.300 --> 00:04.835
Nice, huh? My dad
just got him for me.

00:04.855 --> 00:06.257
His name is Winner,

00:06.291 --> 00:08.361
and that's just what
I intend on doing.

00:08.362 --> 00:11.071
There's no chance that you're
still seeing Cassandra, right?

00:11.072 --> 00:13.630
Caleb. Caleb!

00:13.665 --> 00:15.199
The real reason
you're going to Moose Jaw

00:15.233 --> 00:17.268
is so you can screw up
Miranda's wedding?

00:17.302 --> 00:19.270
Well, I have to say
congratulations!

00:20.672 --> 00:22.922
Give me-ah, hey!

00:22.942 --> 00:27.044
It's over, Amy.
Peter and I, we've...

00:27.716 --> 00:30.272
We've decided to separate.

00:37.989 --> 00:40.023
Did I tell you
how much I missed you?

00:40.057 --> 00:41.725
Well, I missed you, too.

00:44.295 --> 00:47.497
I'm glad to hear
that Lily's doing so well.

00:47.531 --> 00:51.701
Yeah, the program really
seems to be helping.

00:51.735 --> 00:53.779
But it was hard for me
to see her there,

00:53.799 --> 00:55.542
but I'm glad I went.

00:56.752 --> 00:59.327
Do you think she's gonna
make it to the wedding?

00:59.347 --> 01:02.712
Well, she's pretty determined
to be there.

01:02.732 --> 01:05.080
Speaking of that...

01:05.114 --> 01:08.283
Are you sure that you're okay
with the venue?

01:08.318 --> 01:10.252
I'm happy with it,
if you're happy with it.

01:10.286 --> 01:11.888
I'd marry you anywhere.

01:16.581 --> 01:19.653
I wish I could just stay here
all day, like this.

01:21.796 --> 01:25.426
I honestly can't take much more sleeping
on the floor, Lou. My neck is killing me.

01:25.446 --> 01:28.063
Look, you don't have to sleep
on the floor. I told you that.

01:28.083 --> 01:30.447
Yeah, I know that's what you said,
but you're obviously uncomfortable

01:30.467 --> 01:31.606
and I don't wanna...

01:31.641 --> 01:34.053
Look, this isn't easy
for either of us.

01:34.073 --> 01:36.344
But we only have to make it
through a few more days.

01:36.378 --> 01:38.079
Why can't I just sleep on the
couch, maybe, just for tonight?

01:38.113 --> 01:40.056
Then what do we tell Georgie
when she sees you?

01:40.076 --> 01:40.998
The truth.

01:41.018 --> 01:44.085
Peter, we agreed
to wait until the audition's over. I...

01:44.119 --> 01:46.855
'kay. It's just it's getting harder
and harder to pull this off,

01:46.889 --> 01:49.290
and Georgie doesn't miss
a thing.

01:49.324 --> 01:51.659
Look, I know, but she has been talking
about this tryout for the extreme team

01:51.693 --> 01:54.529
since she didn't make it
last year, okay?

01:54.563 --> 01:56.164
As soon as the
audition is over,

01:56.198 --> 01:58.166
we are going to make it
our priority

01:58.200 --> 01:59.633
to help her get through this,
right?

01:59.668 --> 02:02.537
I agree. We'll tell her.

02:03.002 --> 02:05.354
Okay.

02:05.374 --> 02:07.942
Um... I better go get her.
She's done her class by now.

02:07.976 --> 02:10.477
Um... Peter,

02:10.511 --> 02:13.948
I should probably fill grandpa
and dad in on what's going on.

02:14.299 --> 02:16.808
Okay. You sure?

02:16.828 --> 02:20.054
No. But it has to be done.

02:20.088 --> 02:22.155
All right. Well,
I should be a part of that.

02:22.190 --> 02:24.894
No. This is... something
I have to do on my own.

02:24.914 --> 02:26.826
No, Lou, this is not something
you do on your own.

02:26.860 --> 02:28.128
Yes, it is, Peter. I...

02:28.162 --> 02:30.063
Lou!

02:30.098 --> 02:33.333
Hey, kitty cat!
What're you doing?

02:39.673 --> 02:42.508
Uh-huh. Yeah, okay.

02:42.542 --> 02:44.978
Yeah, I'll meet for coffee. I just
gotta finish up some work here.

02:45.012 --> 02:48.073
I'll call you when I'm done.
Okay, bye.

02:49.004 --> 02:51.250
So?

02:51.284 --> 02:52.986
Gonna actually do some work
or just stand here

02:53.020 --> 02:55.421
grinning like a fool all day?

02:55.455 --> 02:57.704
Just talking to Casey.

02:57.724 --> 02:59.591
So it sounds like things
are pretty good with you two.

02:59.626 --> 03:01.364
Oh, they couldn't be better.

03:01.384 --> 03:02.977
Yeah, well, I'm glad you...

03:02.997 --> 03:06.799
Got past that whole
Moose Jaw thing.

03:06.834 --> 03:09.302
What Moose Jaw thing?
I-I never went to the wedding.

03:09.336 --> 03:11.838
What's there to get past? I don't
need to tell her anything.

03:11.872 --> 03:13.739
Oh yeah...
Yeah, that's right.

03:13.773 --> 03:16.361
Why be honest and upfront
with the woman

03:16.381 --> 03:19.445
you might just be in love with.

03:19.919 --> 03:21.847
Hey, uh... Before
you go anywhere,

03:21.881 --> 03:24.273
there's something I need
to talk to you about inside.

03:24.293 --> 03:26.589
Who? Me or him?

03:27.364 --> 03:29.459
Both of you.

03:31.677 --> 03:33.539
The audition's
only a few days away,

03:33.559 --> 03:35.600
so right now
you should all be focused

03:35.620 --> 03:37.725
on fine-tuning your tricks.

03:37.745 --> 03:39.649
Okay, I'll see you next time...

03:39.669 --> 03:42.367
And be prepared
for a special guest.

03:42.401 --> 03:45.370
Trudie, the extreme team coach,
might just drop by,

03:45.404 --> 03:48.973
- to see how you're all doing!
- No way! Oh my gosh!

03:49.007 --> 03:50.908
Can you believe the coach
is gonna come watch us?

03:50.943 --> 03:53.116
No big whoop.
I see her all the time.

03:53.136 --> 03:55.046
You do?

03:55.080 --> 03:58.549
Yeah. She and
Sandra are friends.

03:58.584 --> 04:00.618
She drops by
during my lessons sometimes.

04:00.652 --> 04:03.687
Trudie's really nice.
She's even given me a few tips.

04:03.721 --> 04:05.945
Wait, you still need
private lessons?

04:05.965 --> 04:07.806
My dad insisted.

04:07.826 --> 04:10.127
He wants me to kill
at the audition.

04:10.161 --> 04:12.129
I've been working on
an awesome new trick.

04:12.163 --> 04:14.504
I'd say I have the spot
on the team

04:14.524 --> 04:16.200
pretty much in the bag.

04:16.233 --> 04:18.034
Oh, yeah? Well,
don't count on it!

04:18.069 --> 04:20.202
Because I know you only joined
trick riding to bug me!

04:20.237 --> 04:22.305
So bring it on, because I'm
going to whip your butt.

04:22.339 --> 04:24.013
And I've got a new signature
trick I'm going to perform

04:24.033 --> 04:25.562
that's pretty off the charts,

04:25.582 --> 04:27.010
and I've been taking
private lessons.

04:27.044 --> 04:29.847
- And you know what else?
- Georgie!

05:15.911 --> 05:18.860
Separating? I can't believe it.

05:18.894 --> 05:21.696
I thought you two
worked this out in Vancouver.

05:21.730 --> 05:25.433
We tried, but it's
just not working anymore.

05:25.947 --> 05:28.469
We're not happy,
and I wanna stay here

05:28.503 --> 05:31.085
and Peter wants to keep working
in Vancouver, so...

05:31.105 --> 05:34.547
So this is about a job for him?
I can't believe that guy.

05:34.567 --> 05:36.279
Dad, don't...
don't do that, okay?

05:36.299 --> 05:39.349
'Cause this is just as much me
as it is Peter.

05:39.369 --> 05:41.115
So what can we do?

05:41.150 --> 05:43.109
Well,
the-the girls don't know

05:43.129 --> 05:44.995
and we wanna keep it that way,
for now.

05:45.015 --> 05:47.488
At least until Georgie makes it through
her audition, which is important.

05:47.522 --> 05:50.457
So if you could just...
keep it to yourselves for now.

05:50.492 --> 05:52.379
No. No, I don't
wanna hear this.

05:52.399 --> 05:54.295
Dad...

05:54.329 --> 05:58.265
So... this, this
separation, maybe it'll...

05:58.300 --> 06:00.433
give you time to sort it out.

06:00.467 --> 06:02.135
I don't think so, grandpa.

06:02.170 --> 06:04.104
It's probably gonna end
in divorce.

06:04.138 --> 06:06.673
Well, you really think
it's gonna come to that?

06:06.708 --> 06:09.514
I didn't think that Peter
and I were ever gonna separate,

06:09.534 --> 06:11.644
but here we are. So...

06:11.679 --> 06:14.075
I just have to be realistic.

06:14.095 --> 06:16.382
Realistic!

06:16.417 --> 06:18.651
Katie? How long
were you down there for?

06:18.686 --> 06:21.487
This kind of
behaviour is not okay.

06:21.522 --> 06:23.463
- Okay, well fine!
- No, it's not okay, Georgie!

06:23.483 --> 06:25.914
What is going on here?

06:25.934 --> 06:28.961
- Go ahead.
- It's just Olivia.

06:28.995 --> 06:32.297
She was bragging about her
stupid private lessons

06:32.332 --> 06:34.666
and her secret new trick she's
gonna perform at the audition

06:34.701 --> 06:37.269
and I just... kind of lost it
and told her some crap.

06:37.303 --> 06:39.138
You told her
some complete untruths.

06:39.172 --> 06:41.874
Okay, it sounds like Olivia
was just trying to wind you up.

06:41.908 --> 06:45.300
Well, I know I should've
just ignored her, but...

06:45.320 --> 06:46.663
She drives me crazy!

06:46.683 --> 06:48.880
You know what? Georgie, it's okay.
I get it.

06:48.914 --> 06:50.716
Because Olivia kinda drives me
crazy, too.

06:50.750 --> 06:53.252
Oh, no, no. I'm
sorry, it's not okay, Lou.

06:53.286 --> 06:55.220
We've been through this before
with Olivia, Georgie,

06:55.255 --> 06:58.022
and she understands... hey!
That it's not acceptable to...

06:58.057 --> 06:59.832
That's not what I meant, Peter.

06:59.852 --> 07:01.818
You know how I feel about lying.

07:01.838 --> 07:05.002
But Olivia is a challenging
personality, and you...

07:05.765 --> 07:08.266
and you raise
some excellent points

07:08.300 --> 07:11.404
that, you know, I think Georgie
should really reflect on, right?

07:11.424 --> 07:13.037
Uh... sure.

07:17.108 --> 07:18.977
Hey...

07:19.011 --> 07:22.380
Look, um... I know you have a
lot on your plate right now,

07:22.414 --> 07:24.982
but... I was hoping maybe you could
help Georgie prep for that tryout?

07:25.016 --> 07:27.351
Yeah. Why, what's up?

07:27.386 --> 07:30.101
I just... I just wanna level the playing
field for her a little bit, you know,

07:30.121 --> 07:34.061
and... it might help
keep her busy.

07:34.326 --> 07:38.361
I know we can't keep this up
for much longer, but I...

07:38.396 --> 07:41.598
I'd love to give the girls a few
more days of "normal" if I can.

07:41.632 --> 07:43.842
Of course. I'd
be happy to help.

07:43.862 --> 07:45.983
Thanks.

07:51.542 --> 07:55.577
Four... five... six...

07:55.732 --> 08:00.075
Seven... eight... nine...

08:01.502 --> 08:05.566
Ten! Ready or not, here I come!

08:07.391 --> 08:11.648
I wonder where Katie could be?
I can't find her anywhere!

08:12.579 --> 08:15.531
Boo! I found you!
Hey! Where are you going?

08:15.565 --> 08:18.067
- I got you! I found you!
- Where are you going?!

08:18.101 --> 08:20.269
Hey... ah, it's
almost time for Katie's nap,

08:20.304 --> 08:22.562
so why don't you get started
on your homework, okay?

08:22.582 --> 08:24.082
It's all done.

08:24.102 --> 08:25.416
Well, you're book report isn't.

08:25.436 --> 08:27.045
You can started on that
if you got free time.

08:27.065 --> 08:28.176
But it's not due for weeks.

08:28.211 --> 08:30.896
It's not up for discussion.
Let's go.

08:47.012 --> 08:48.529
You're back.

08:48.564 --> 08:53.015
Lou, honey, I wanna apologize
for reacting the way I did.

08:54.070 --> 08:57.106
It's okay. I... I
should've told you sooner...

08:57.126 --> 08:58.740
No. No, no.

08:58.760 --> 09:01.827
With all you're dealing with,
I... I understand.

09:01.847 --> 09:03.077
Katie wants to
decorate cookies...

09:03.111 --> 09:05.007
when she wakes up.

09:06.915 --> 09:08.745
It's Maggie's.
I have to take this.

09:08.765 --> 09:12.253
- Yeah.
- Hello?

09:12.831 --> 09:15.852
Can... can you hang on
until I get there?

09:15.872 --> 09:18.592
Yes. No, no, no. I'll...
I'll be right there.

09:19.315 --> 09:21.099
Now my other server is sick.

09:21.119 --> 09:24.064
Probably the same flu. I...

09:24.099 --> 09:25.432
I know this sounds terrible
to say,

09:25.466 --> 09:28.002
but the timing
just couldn't be worse.

09:28.036 --> 09:30.144
I... I really need to be here
for the kids right now.

09:30.164 --> 09:31.400
I mean, you know...

09:31.420 --> 09:33.240
Georgie's out practicing
with Amy and...

09:33.275 --> 09:35.433
God knows if she finished
her book report.

09:35.453 --> 09:36.543
And Katie, she's...

09:36.577 --> 09:38.527
She's gonna wake up any minute
and she's gonna wanna do this,

09:38.547 --> 09:40.373
but we'll just...
We'll do it another time.

09:40.393 --> 09:43.429
- Lou, let me do it.
- No, dad.

09:43.449 --> 09:45.719
Honey, I did it the
whole time you were in Vancouver.

09:45.753 --> 09:48.051
You were supervising. It's not the
same as being on the front lines.

09:48.071 --> 09:50.156
I can handle it.

09:50.190 --> 09:54.294
Look, it's a really
sweet offer, but...

09:54.328 --> 09:56.516
I wish I could fix
everything for you,

09:56.536 --> 09:58.630
but I can't.

09:59.157 --> 10:00.967
So let me do this.

10:01.001 --> 10:04.558
I'll look after Maggie's, and I'll
be there for as long as you need me.

10:05.302 --> 10:06.264
Really?

10:06.284 --> 10:08.474
Yeah, just let me do it.

10:09.568 --> 10:11.677
Thank you.

10:12.345 --> 10:15.478
All right. Let's
try the Fender drag.

10:16.696 --> 10:19.949
That's it. That's good!
Keep that leg extended.

10:21.675 --> 10:23.025
Hi!

10:23.382 --> 10:25.790
Good job. Nice!

10:26.422 --> 10:28.310
Hey! I mean, that looked great.

10:28.330 --> 10:29.995
You've definitely
shown improvement.

10:30.029 --> 10:32.784
Okay, well, it needs
to be perfect for the tryouts.

10:32.804 --> 10:34.227
Well, Georgie,

10:34.247 --> 10:36.678
the more you practice
the better it's gonna get.

10:36.698 --> 10:39.082
The thing is,
I could really use a new trick.

10:39.102 --> 10:41.305
We don't really have time
to learn a new trick.

10:41.340 --> 10:43.332
Well, Olivia's got
a whole new signature move

10:43.352 --> 10:45.226
she's gonna perform.

10:45.567 --> 10:47.584
Let me think about it, okay?

10:47.878 --> 10:49.864
Yes!

10:51.213 --> 10:53.494
All right.

10:53.514 --> 10:55.107
There you go.
Thank you very much.

10:55.127 --> 10:56.922
And sir, that is for you.

10:56.942 --> 10:59.423
Yup, coming!
And I'll fill this up.

11:00.416 --> 11:02.304
Okay! I got it.

11:02.324 --> 11:04.395
I'll be right there.

11:04.429 --> 11:06.797
So did you invite me over
here so I could wait tables?

11:06.831 --> 11:09.866
Actually, when I called you, it
was completely empty in here, so...

11:09.886 --> 11:12.303
If you wanna help me out,
you can.

11:12.337 --> 11:14.617
It's up to you.

11:14.911 --> 11:16.974
Follow my lead.

11:16.994 --> 11:19.658
Okay. Thank you.

11:20.341 --> 11:22.512
Oh, guys. I'm kinda swamped.

11:22.546 --> 11:23.947
I tell you what,
just get me next time, okay?

11:23.981 --> 11:27.017
No, no, no.
What'd they have?

11:27.051 --> 11:30.737
Uh... they had the... the chili
and corn bread,

11:30.757 --> 11:32.522
and two coffees.

11:32.556 --> 11:35.124
So with tax, that would be...
$22.56,

11:35.158 --> 11:38.294
or $11.28 apiece.

11:38.328 --> 11:40.863
That's... that's right.
Very good.

11:40.898 --> 11:44.199
Yeah. Follow my lead, Tim.

11:49.929 --> 11:52.041
So, Amy, um...

11:52.075 --> 11:54.543
Have you started working on the
seating chart for the reception?

11:54.577 --> 11:57.913
Not yet, Lou, but...
I'll get to it soon.

12:02.952 --> 12:05.785
So, Georgie, how're you
feeling about the tryouts?

12:05.805 --> 12:06.922
Mm. Great!

12:06.956 --> 12:09.151
I'm definitely ready
now that Amy's helping me.

12:17.371 --> 12:19.853
What's going on?

12:21.839 --> 12:23.669
Divorce!

12:26.337 --> 12:27.675
What do you mean divorce?

12:32.154 --> 12:34.015
Who's getting a divorce?

12:40.129 --> 12:41.840
Georgie...

12:42.784 --> 12:44.484
Is it true?!

12:47.271 --> 12:49.889
Yeah. We're getting separated.

12:49.909 --> 12:52.507
- Why are you doing this?!
- It's complicated.

12:52.541 --> 12:54.803
Why? Why is it complicated?

12:54.804 --> 12:57.312
I guess the bottom line is we...

12:57.346 --> 12:58.613
stopped listening to each other.

12:58.647 --> 13:00.313
What does that even mean?

13:00.333 --> 13:02.950
- Well, eventually, we...
- We just, we...

13:02.984 --> 13:04.952
We realized
that want different things.

13:04.986 --> 13:06.034
Like what?

13:06.054 --> 13:07.819
You know what? We
would rather focus on

13:07.839 --> 13:09.718
the two important things
that unite us...

13:09.738 --> 13:11.083
You and Katie.

13:11.103 --> 13:14.049
Because no matter what happens,
we will always be your parents.

13:14.069 --> 13:16.047
And we will always be a family.

13:16.067 --> 13:19.003
How? How will we be a family?

13:19.067 --> 13:21.636
I'll still be here all the time.

13:21.670 --> 13:23.471
I don't even think you'll find
it that much different, honey.

13:23.505 --> 13:25.940
It'll be totally different!
How can you even say that?!

13:25.974 --> 13:29.109
Georgie, look.
I know this is hard, trust me,

13:29.144 --> 13:31.511
but we are gonna answer
all of your questions,

13:31.546 --> 13:34.072
and we will be there for you
no matter what.

13:34.092 --> 13:35.549
No, you won't! Because if you
wanted to be there for me,

13:35.583 --> 13:37.050
then you wouldn't be doing this!

13:37.070 --> 13:37.998
No, no, no, Georgie.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.855
No!
I don't wanna talk to either of you!

13:47.862 --> 13:50.597
- Hey, Caleb!
- Hey, man.

13:50.631 --> 13:52.399
Uh, good to see you.

13:52.433 --> 13:54.300
Are you sure about that?

13:54.335 --> 13:56.470
I got tired of waiting
for you to call me back.

13:56.504 --> 13:59.226
Yeah, sorry. Um... uh...
Business has kinda ramped up.

13:59.246 --> 14:02.376
- It's been crazy.
- I hear. So how's it going?

14:02.410 --> 14:04.143
We're moving into
a higher end stock,

14:04.178 --> 14:07.046
so, uh, it's going
really great so far.

14:07.199 --> 14:09.715
Well, that's not
the impression Amy got.

14:09.750 --> 14:12.418
Am-oh... okay, look, I
know what you guys are thinking.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.487
Don't worry,
I got it covered, all right?

14:14.521 --> 14:16.890
Great. Can't wait to hear
all about it.

14:19.959 --> 14:22.661
Look, man, I can't tonight.
I'm still on the clock.

14:22.696 --> 14:25.063
What's he doing here?

14:25.098 --> 14:27.199
Pretty sure that's
none of your business.

14:27.233 --> 14:28.904
Well, Caleb and I have
actual business to discuss,

14:28.924 --> 14:30.703
if you don't mind...

14:30.737 --> 14:33.406
And if I do? You gonna get out
and sucker punch me again?

14:33.440 --> 14:35.974
I'll catch up
with you tomorrow, 'kay?

14:36.472 --> 14:38.543
Yeah, sure.

14:55.146 --> 14:57.796
don't tell me it's
gonna be okay because it's not.

14:58.044 --> 15:01.466
They love you, Georgie.

15:02.682 --> 15:04.869
If they
loved me, they wouldn't do this!

15:04.904 --> 15:07.704
They couldn't love you more.

15:12.776 --> 15:15.612
I've got ya.

15:16.530 --> 15:18.515
I've got ya.

15:18.550 --> 15:21.232
I knew it was
too good to be true!

15:22.988 --> 15:25.141
Well, you'll
still be a family.

15:25.161 --> 15:27.386
It'll... it'll just look
a little different is all.

15:30.929 --> 15:33.700
You'll see.
It's not the end of the world.

15:37.097 --> 15:39.636
How long have they
been faking it?

15:39.671 --> 15:43.070
It's been real
hard for them, Georgie.

15:43.969 --> 15:49.124
They waited to tell you because they
wanted to keep things normal for you.

15:51.481 --> 15:55.618
Well... do you think there's a
chance they'll change their minds?

15:55.652 --> 15:58.772
Well, anything's
possible, that's for sure.

16:00.404 --> 16:02.558
But I wouldn't count on it.

16:02.593 --> 16:04.961
They didn't come
to this decision lightly.

16:04.995 --> 16:09.649
They... they tried hard
to work things out.

16:11.702 --> 16:14.637
Why can't they try harder?

16:28.870 --> 16:31.086
Oh, hey. There you are.

16:31.121 --> 16:33.021
Look, Georgie, listen. Geor...

16:33.055 --> 16:36.983
Now, Lou, just...
Let her be.

16:37.526 --> 16:40.260
You and Peter, you've been living
with this for a while now.

16:40.280 --> 16:42.245
She needs time to catch up.

16:42.265 --> 16:44.866
Oh, grandpa...

16:44.901 --> 16:46.968
It wasn't supposed to happen
that way.

16:47.003 --> 16:49.757
I doubt there's a right way
to go about it.

16:49.777 --> 16:54.222
Yeah, but she's just been
through so much already and...

16:55.877 --> 17:00.415
Hey... so Katie's down.
Um... where's Georgie?

17:00.449 --> 17:02.783
Uh, she just went to bed.
I think I will, too.

17:02.817 --> 17:04.460
Okay.

17:07.155 --> 17:11.157
So, Katie, she... has no idea
what she was saying.

17:11.192 --> 17:13.827
Oh, thank God.

17:14.237 --> 17:16.829
That was my fault, okay?
I-I-I...

17:16.865 --> 17:18.432
I was talking to grandpa
about it,

17:18.465 --> 17:20.497
and she must have overheard me.
I am so sorry.

17:20.517 --> 17:22.069
Don't. don't be sorry, okay?

17:22.103 --> 17:24.871
It was gonna come out sooner
or later anyway, so...

17:24.891 --> 17:28.040
Yeah. I guess
it's a relief, right?

17:28.076 --> 17:31.935
I mean... we don't have
to pretend anymore.

17:33.642 --> 17:35.328
You don't have to sleep
on the floor.

17:37.151 --> 17:41.335
It just makes it... very real.

17:44.524 --> 17:46.693
Peter, are we doing
the right thing?

17:46.713 --> 17:48.995
I mean, for Georgie, she...

17:49.029 --> 17:50.913
She's already been through
so much in her life,

17:50.933 --> 17:54.133
and it took her so long
to... to trust us,

17:54.167 --> 17:58.370
and to feel like she was a part
of our family and...

17:58.405 --> 18:01.317
How can we do this to her now?

18:02.309 --> 18:05.671
She's... she's resilient.
Georgie's resilient.

18:05.691 --> 18:07.413
She'll get through it.

18:08.188 --> 18:10.081
So will we.

18:10.251 --> 18:11.316
Yeah...

18:11.350 --> 18:14.129
Kids are only happy
when their parents are happy.

18:14.331 --> 18:16.208
You're right.

18:21.094 --> 18:24.425
Whew! Well, thank you
for helping out today.

18:24.445 --> 18:26.999
- I think we did pretty well.
- Mm...

18:27.734 --> 18:29.498
Yes, working in close quarters,

18:29.518 --> 18:32.770
that is a true
relationship test.

18:33.225 --> 18:36.974
You know, yeah, it's good
to test a relationship.

18:37.220 --> 18:39.977
I'm real sorry to hear
about Lou and Peter.

18:41.020 --> 18:42.113
You doing okay?

18:42.148 --> 18:45.149
I... I don't know
how I feel about that.

18:45.183 --> 18:47.190
Lou said that they were trying
to work things out

18:47.210 --> 18:48.653
and then they...

18:48.687 --> 18:52.324
finally decided that
they weren't happy anymore.

18:52.344 --> 18:54.372
Well, it's gotta be tough,

18:54.392 --> 18:57.324
especially when kids
are involved.

18:57.344 --> 19:00.531
At least it sounds like they're finally
being honest with each other, right?

19:00.565 --> 19:02.907
I mean, in a relationship,
if you don't have honesty,

19:02.927 --> 19:06.293
then... you don't have much
of anything, do you?

19:08.698 --> 19:10.440
Do you want a piece of pie?

19:10.475 --> 19:13.068
I
would love some pie.

19:14.879 --> 19:16.680
Oh hey, what do you
have in the way of cheese?

19:16.714 --> 19:19.613
Because there is nothing like
a piece of apple pie

19:19.633 --> 19:21.428
and a slice of aged cheddar.

19:21.448 --> 19:24.328
I don't know. We have ice cream.

19:24.348 --> 19:26.556
I'll go check.

19:35.414 --> 19:37.942
Love, Reggie?

19:43.974 --> 19:47.176
Poor Georgie. That's
a tough way to find out.

19:47.914 --> 19:50.478
It was pretty awful.

19:51.311 --> 19:53.292
But I would rather not talk
about it.

19:53.312 --> 19:56.151
Why don't you tell me
how your day was instead?

19:57.025 --> 19:59.181
Okay. Well, I uh...

19:59.201 --> 20:01.224
I tracked down Caleb
at the rodeo grounds.

20:01.244 --> 20:03.006
How's he doing?

20:03.026 --> 20:04.359
I didn't get the
chance to find out,

20:04.394 --> 20:07.461
because Jesse showed up.
Caleb blew me off.

20:07.496 --> 20:09.515
That doesn't sound like him.

20:09.535 --> 20:11.432
I know.

20:11.466 --> 20:13.401
So... I think I'm gonna
invite him over

20:13.435 --> 20:16.270
and see how big a hole
he's dug for himself.

20:16.304 --> 20:18.733
That's probably a good idea.

20:21.541 --> 20:23.687
I should go.

20:25.750 --> 20:27.814
Oh, you sure
you can't stay a bit longer?

20:27.849 --> 20:29.985
I just wanna be
there for Georgie,

20:30.005 --> 20:32.013
and for Lou. Okay?

20:32.033 --> 20:33.910
I get it.

20:37.159 --> 20:40.393
Okay, maybe a couple
more minutes.

20:51.467 --> 20:53.874
Georgie?

20:54.570 --> 20:56.576
Sweetheart?

21:37.346 --> 21:41.849
Go get 'em, Georgie!
Show 'em what you got!

21:41.883 --> 21:43.917
You might wanna
cut her some slack.

21:43.952 --> 21:47.121
They tend to overcompensate,
especially at first.

21:47.155 --> 21:49.027
What're you talking about?

21:49.047 --> 21:50.958
I'm talking about parents.

21:50.992 --> 21:52.641
Guilt turns them into
real weirdos.

21:52.661 --> 21:55.426
Trust me. I know all about it.

21:56.097 --> 21:58.183
Look... I may or may not
have overheard your mom

21:58.203 --> 22:01.487
filling Sandra in
on the "situation" before class.

22:01.507 --> 22:04.003
What?! That is none
of your business!

22:04.038 --> 22:05.605
Besides, what do you even care?

22:05.640 --> 22:08.208
Take a chill pill, already.

22:08.242 --> 22:10.810
I just thought you might
like to know that I can relate.

22:10.844 --> 22:12.179
I doubt that.

22:12.213 --> 22:14.147
Oh, yeah?

22:14.182 --> 22:17.550
Well, my mom's not
actually my mom, so...

22:17.584 --> 22:19.752
You know,
if you're not interested...

22:19.787 --> 22:22.569
you can just forget it.

22:27.890 --> 22:29.228
Hey, Caleb!

22:29.262 --> 22:31.731
You look like you could use
one of this.

22:32.233 --> 22:34.314
You'd be right about that.

22:34.334 --> 22:36.068
Thanks, man.

22:36.102 --> 22:39.914
Look, uh...
Sorry about last night.

22:39.934 --> 22:42.990
- Duty called.
- Hey, it's no problem.

22:43.409 --> 22:45.544
I get it.

22:45.579 --> 22:47.379
But what was Jesse doing here?

22:47.855 --> 22:50.322
He is my partner.

22:50.342 --> 22:53.185
I know, but I thought he wasn't
gonna be involved in the day-to-day.

22:53.219 --> 22:54.986
And I thought me giving
you that big bag of money...

22:55.021 --> 22:58.279
meant it wasn't your business
anymore.

23:01.587 --> 23:03.261
Look, Caleb...

23:03.295 --> 23:06.797
Amy told me that those thoroughbreds
cost fifty grand each.

23:06.832 --> 23:11.001
I'm worried about you, man.
We both are.

23:11.452 --> 23:15.020
Jesse is pretty hands on,
actually.

23:15.440 --> 23:17.775
And how's that
going for you?

23:17.809 --> 23:21.613
Fine. As long as you don't
mind being treated like hired help.

23:22.390 --> 23:24.515
What're you talking about?

23:28.787 --> 23:31.188
Come on, Caleb, you gotta
tell me what's going on?

23:31.223 --> 23:32.723
Jesse's been fronting me
all the money

23:32.758 --> 23:35.418
to cover the costs
of the stock we buy,

23:35.438 --> 23:36.761
and my half of the stable fees.

23:36.795 --> 23:39.935
So, in reality,
he's calling all the shots

23:39.955 --> 23:43.162
and I'm just sort of...
along for the ride.

23:43.348 --> 23:45.650
Yippy.

23:46.419 --> 23:47.951
I don't know what to say.

23:47.971 --> 23:50.111
How about... I told you so?

23:50.131 --> 23:52.998
'Cause you did. More than once.

23:56.446 --> 23:58.702
Okay, Caleb, there's
gotta be a way outta this.

23:58.722 --> 24:00.349
Why don't you come over,

24:00.384 --> 24:01.951
I'll throw some steaks on the
barbecue, and we'll figure this out.

24:01.986 --> 24:05.424
There's nothing to figure out.
I'm in way over my head.

24:05.704 --> 24:07.658
So what're you gonna do?

24:08.992 --> 24:10.526
It's not your problem.

24:10.560 --> 24:13.331
But steaks? Yeah, I'm... I'm in.

24:17.934 --> 24:21.103
Um... I'm really sorry
about earlier.

24:21.951 --> 24:24.540
That's okay.

24:24.899 --> 24:28.105
So what do you mean your mom's
not really your mom?

24:28.125 --> 24:30.432
My parents got divorced
four years ago,

24:30.452 --> 24:32.247
and my dad remarried.

24:32.282 --> 24:35.650
I call her mom, but she's
actually my stepmother.

24:35.851 --> 24:37.864
It's not that big a deal.

24:37.884 --> 24:40.784
Well, it sure sounds
like a big deal.

24:40.986 --> 24:42.691
There are perks.

24:42.725 --> 24:46.328
That's what the horses and the
private lessons are all about.

24:46.362 --> 24:50.199
I told you, guilt can make
parents act pretty kooky.

24:55.597 --> 24:58.367
So do you... miss your real mom?

24:58.387 --> 24:59.907
Yeah.

24:59.942 --> 25:02.844
I don't see her nearly as much
as I'd like to,

25:02.878 --> 25:06.469
but, eventually,
you just get used to it.

25:13.555 --> 25:16.924
You almost look like
you know what you're doing.

25:17.325 --> 25:18.726
You here to check up on me?

25:18.760 --> 25:21.405
I'm just looking
for a cup of coffee.

25:22.801 --> 25:24.931
So I heard from
Lou last night.

25:24.966 --> 25:27.033
Sounds like she's having
a rough time.

25:27.068 --> 25:30.504
Yeah. It's going about
as well as can be expected.

25:30.538 --> 25:32.406
Yeah, well, that's the thing
about relationships, Jack.

25:32.440 --> 25:35.488
They all end up in heartache.

25:35.508 --> 25:39.173
- What happened now?
- Who says anything happened?

25:39.654 --> 25:41.481
Good then.

25:42.275 --> 25:45.418
I saw a text
that to Casey got from some guy.

25:45.452 --> 25:49.222
- So?
- So it said, "with love, Reggie."

25:49.737 --> 25:51.624
She's meeting with Reggie,
right now.

25:51.658 --> 25:53.626
Who is that?
Some old flame?

25:53.660 --> 25:56.054
I don't know who it is.
I've never heard of the guy.

25:56.074 --> 25:57.652
She's never mentioned him.

25:57.672 --> 25:59.591
You know,
you are some piece of work.

25:59.611 --> 26:00.879
What're you talking about?

26:00.899 --> 26:03.936
Why can't you learn anything?

26:03.970 --> 26:06.289
You wanna know something,
you ask questions.

26:06.309 --> 26:08.840
You don't keep jumping
to conclusions all the time.

26:08.875 --> 26:10.976
You expect Casey to lay her
cards on the table,

26:11.011 --> 26:14.422
well, you have to show her
your hand first.

26:14.608 --> 26:16.733
It's a two-way street.

26:18.151 --> 26:20.645
Okay, we have
time for one more.

26:20.665 --> 26:22.922
- Sandra! Hi.
- Hi!

26:22.956 --> 26:27.025
This is my friend, Trudie.
She's the extreme team trainer.

26:27.059 --> 26:29.628
I don't wanna interrupt.
Just pretend I'm not here.

26:29.662 --> 26:32.291
All right, everyone settle down.

26:32.311 --> 26:34.695
Olivia, you're up.

26:53.385 --> 26:55.053
Nice work!

26:55.087 --> 26:57.357
That's a good
note to end the class on.

26:57.377 --> 26:59.812
I'll see you all at the tryout!

27:10.586 --> 27:13.564
So, uh... how'd that meeting go?

27:13.584 --> 27:15.705
It was productive.

27:16.232 --> 27:18.120
Productive...

27:18.140 --> 27:20.979
Interesting choice of words.

27:21.367 --> 27:23.500
Not really.

27:24.043 --> 27:27.917
- What's going on with you?
- Nothing.

27:27.952 --> 27:30.954
I just thought it'd be great
if we could talk about things.

27:31.628 --> 27:33.790
Okay. I'll bite.
What kind of things?

27:33.824 --> 27:35.734
Well, you gotta
admit, there's still a lot

27:35.754 --> 27:37.954
that we don't know
about each other, so...

27:37.974 --> 27:39.645
I was thinking maybe... uh...

27:39.665 --> 27:41.739
Okay, how 'bout we tell
each other something

27:41.759 --> 27:43.616
that the other person
doesn't know.

27:43.636 --> 27:46.273
Like what?

27:46.293 --> 27:49.138
Like um...

27:49.782 --> 27:53.075
Okay. Okay,
you'll laugh at this.

27:53.629 --> 27:56.835
I thought about crashing
Miranda's wedding

27:56.855 --> 27:59.048
when you weren't here.

28:07.455 --> 28:09.394
You know,
I really did need this.

28:09.414 --> 28:12.693
Thanks. To new beginnings
and happier days.

28:12.713 --> 28:14.730
I'll drink to that.

28:21.597 --> 28:23.804
What do you want?

28:23.839 --> 28:27.487
Caleb said
he'd be here, and this can't wait.

28:27.507 --> 28:28.943
What's going on?

28:28.977 --> 28:31.079
An opportunity has
come up on another venture,

28:31.113 --> 28:33.646
but I've got a serious
cash flow problem.

28:33.666 --> 28:37.251
So... I'm gonna have
to call in your loan.

28:37.285 --> 28:39.520
This a joke. You know I
don't have that kind of cash.

28:39.555 --> 28:41.573
I'm sorry, Caleb.
I'm in a bit of a jam.

28:41.593 --> 28:44.458
I don't have any other choice.
It's just business.

28:44.492 --> 28:47.188
You'll receive official
notification outlining the details,

28:47.208 --> 28:49.422
but I wanted to tell you
in person, first.

28:49.442 --> 28:51.392
What if I can't pay?

28:51.412 --> 28:53.471
Well, if the
money's not paid in full

28:53.491 --> 28:55.269
within the specified time frame,

28:55.303 --> 28:58.434
I'll be forced to register
a lien on this property.

28:58.869 --> 29:00.416
A land grab.

29:00.436 --> 29:01.741
I don't have an alternative.

29:01.776 --> 29:03.110
Is this what this
has all been about?

29:03.144 --> 29:06.180
Hey, hey, hey, hey...
He's not worth it, all right?

29:06.982 --> 29:08.772
I don't know what you mean.

29:08.792 --> 29:10.401
I was crazy to trust you.

29:10.421 --> 29:13.581
Trust? That's real
funny coming from the guy

29:13.601 --> 29:16.590
who's been running around
with my girlfriend.

29:17.929 --> 29:21.861
Yeah. But hey,
she's all yours, cowboy.

29:22.647 --> 29:25.295
You know what I don't get,
Caleb?

29:25.315 --> 29:27.234
Is what women even see in you.

29:27.254 --> 29:30.553
You're nothing but a broke,
washed-up rodeo bum.

29:30.573 --> 29:32.508
Hey, hey.

29:32.528 --> 29:34.327
See ya around, boys.

29:42.422 --> 29:45.551
Hey! So...? How did it go?

29:45.571 --> 29:47.304
The extreme team
coach was there,

29:47.324 --> 29:48.887
and Georgie looked really good.

29:48.922 --> 29:51.223
No, I didn't! Everyone saw
the trainer talking to Olivia!

29:51.257 --> 29:53.052
She's totally getting the spot
on the team!

29:53.072 --> 29:54.659
Okay, that is not true.

29:54.693 --> 29:56.977
You know what? I don't even care
about the stupid audition anymore.

29:56.997 --> 29:59.030
- I quit.
- Georgie!

30:09.925 --> 30:10.891
If you're
here to change my mind,

30:10.926 --> 30:13.193
you can save your breath.

30:13.227 --> 30:16.012
Georgie...

30:16.032 --> 30:19.599
I get that things are scary
and confusing right now.

30:19.633 --> 30:22.481
You have no idea how I feel!

30:22.501 --> 30:27.307
I do know what it's like to have
your whole world turned upside down.

30:29.410 --> 30:33.080
Yeah, but... not like this.

30:33.114 --> 30:36.724
No, not quite like this.

30:38.911 --> 30:41.467
But when my mom died...

30:41.487 --> 30:45.291
All I wanted to do was curl up
in a ball and hide.

30:45.325 --> 30:47.426
But, if I wanted to help Spartan,

30:47.461 --> 30:49.161
I had to find a way
to push through

30:49.196 --> 30:52.274
all of the pain and anger
I was feeling.

30:52.294 --> 30:56.398
If I didn't,
it meant letting him go.

30:56.418 --> 31:00.506
It was the hardest thing
that I have ever had to do.

31:00.540 --> 31:03.301
But if I hadn't of tried,

31:03.321 --> 31:06.379
I would've regretted it
for the rest of my life.

31:06.413 --> 31:08.547
Yeah, but... that was Spartan.

31:08.581 --> 31:11.135
This is just some...
dumb audition.

31:11.155 --> 31:14.056
I know that's not
how you really feel.

31:14.076 --> 31:16.154
You have been looking forward
to this all year,

31:16.188 --> 31:19.751
and you have been practicing
like crazy.

31:20.464 --> 31:24.311
I even thought of a new trick
that we could try.

31:24.331 --> 31:28.966
You know, you can't control
what's gonna happen.

31:29.197 --> 31:33.550
But you can control
how you deal with it.

31:33.570 --> 31:36.807
I just don't want you to look
back, and regret not going.

31:36.842 --> 31:38.901
So think about it, okay?

31:42.190 --> 31:44.217
And there you go.
Thank you, guys.

31:44.237 --> 31:47.317
Have a good day.

31:51.389 --> 31:54.224
So... what do you mean,

31:54.259 --> 31:57.303
you almost crashed
Miranda's wedding?

31:57.323 --> 32:00.531
I thought that...
if I went, I...

32:00.565 --> 32:02.399
I might get some closure.

32:02.434 --> 32:05.302
But I realized
I didn't need it...

32:05.336 --> 32:08.829
because I should be
looking forward and not back.

32:11.202 --> 32:14.441
So do I get to take some
credit for this new outlook?

32:14.461 --> 32:17.280
Yeah, well, that...
depends on Reggie.

32:17.853 --> 32:19.449
On Reggie?

32:19.483 --> 32:23.286
I saw the text...
From the Reggie guy.

32:23.320 --> 32:24.721
Seemed pretty friendly to me.

32:27.291 --> 32:30.673
Reggie's a nickname...
For Regina.

32:30.693 --> 32:33.362
She's an old friend of mine. We
reconnected at the rodeo last week.

32:33.397 --> 32:35.965
She came into town
to sell me a horse.

32:35.999 --> 32:38.801
That's where I was today.

32:38.835 --> 32:42.887
A girl, Reggie. Huh.

32:43.526 --> 32:45.708
I didn't see that coming.

32:49.079 --> 32:51.647
How 'bout some more pie?

32:51.681 --> 32:55.218
How 'bout... no more secrets?

32:56.676 --> 32:58.770
No more secrets.

32:59.328 --> 33:01.289
I can't believe I'm getting
married in less than a month.

33:01.324 --> 33:04.727
I know. It's crazy.

33:04.747 --> 33:06.595
You know, Amy, the seating
chart is important,

33:06.629 --> 33:09.531
but shouldn't you be out
looking for a dress?

33:09.565 --> 33:13.047
I have a dress...
Mrs. Bell is making it for me.

33:13.067 --> 33:16.424
Mrs. Bell? How is this
the first I'm hearing of this?

33:16.444 --> 33:18.206
Why didn't you tell me?!

33:18.241 --> 33:21.943
I was gonna tell you, but then you
had so much on your mind and...

33:21.977 --> 33:23.897
You see, when I found
mom's dress in the attic,

33:23.917 --> 33:25.312
I wrote to Mrs. bell

33:25.347 --> 33:27.548
and I told her
how beautiful I thought it was.

33:27.582 --> 33:29.250
And she wrote back and told me

33:29.284 --> 33:30.955
she would love to make mine too,

33:30.975 --> 33:32.620
so... I said yes.

33:32.655 --> 33:36.057
Amy, that's... that's amazing.

33:36.091 --> 33:38.125
Mom would be
really, really happy.

33:41.977 --> 33:44.198
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:44.232 --> 33:45.485
Thanks for picking
that stuff up.

33:45.505 --> 33:47.723
Not a problem.

33:47.743 --> 33:50.469
You sure you wanna
be doing this, right now?

33:50.489 --> 33:54.704
Yeah. It feels good to...
be focusing on something else.

33:57.712 --> 33:59.245
Hey, sweetie, did
you want a snack?

33:59.280 --> 34:01.064
Because dinner's not gonna be
for a while.

34:01.084 --> 34:03.163
I'm not hungry.

34:03.985 --> 34:06.419
Is this your seating chart?

34:06.453 --> 34:08.420
Yeah. Would you
like to give us a hand?

34:08.455 --> 34:10.223
Actually, I was wondering if...

34:10.257 --> 34:13.065
maybe you could help me
with that new trick?

34:13.920 --> 34:16.541
All right. Let's go.

34:21.835 --> 34:24.704
Now when you're
ready, drop down.

34:24.737 --> 34:26.304
That's it,
but let go of the horn.

34:26.339 --> 34:28.174
Come on, drop down.

34:28.208 --> 34:31.260
- It's scary!
- Come on! Agh!

34:34.246 --> 34:36.782
All right!

34:36.817 --> 34:39.284
Okay, close... close.

34:39.319 --> 34:41.053
Whoa... boy.

34:41.088 --> 34:43.788
Sandra makes it look so easy.

34:43.822 --> 34:45.824
Yes, well, she's been doing
the stroud layout for a long time.

34:45.858 --> 34:48.025
You have to be brave
and lean out.

34:48.060 --> 34:49.793
Well, I'm never
gonna get it this.

34:49.829 --> 34:52.244
It's a difficult move...
It just takes time.

34:52.264 --> 34:56.101
I don't have time.
The audition is tomorrow.

34:56.135 --> 35:00.038
Georgie, you don't
need a new trick, okay?

35:00.072 --> 35:02.073
Just focus on nailing
the Fender drag

35:02.108 --> 35:05.643
'cause it's great
and you're ready.

35:05.677 --> 35:09.554
Okay, okay, you're right.
You're right. Okay.

35:17.900 --> 35:19.773
Okay. Just get here as
soon as you can, all right?

35:19.793 --> 35:22.159
It's about to start. Okay.

35:22.193 --> 35:24.380
Ty's on his way. He's just
gonna stop at his place first.

35:24.400 --> 35:25.900
Okay.

35:25.920 --> 35:29.133
Um... I'll be right back.

35:29.627 --> 35:32.269
Hey... you look nice.

35:32.303 --> 35:35.773
No, I don't!
These costumes are horrible.

35:35.807 --> 35:38.008
Aren't they?
I hate pink.

35:38.042 --> 35:40.310
You're joking, right?
It's like the best colour ever.

35:40.344 --> 35:41.945
Hi, girls!

35:41.980 --> 35:44.014
Looks like we're ready.

35:44.048 --> 35:46.016
Trudie's here and she's eager
to see what you guys can do.

35:46.050 --> 35:48.351
Okay, Olivia, you're up first.

35:48.386 --> 35:52.054
Now... have fun,
and don't forget to smile!

35:52.089 --> 35:54.991
Okay. All right, well, I uh...
I guess this is it.

35:55.025 --> 35:57.190
Good luck!

36:00.264 --> 36:03.173
- Hey, honey.
- Dad! You made it!

36:03.193 --> 36:04.567
Yeah.

36:04.602 --> 36:06.568
Oh, Casey's covering for me
at the diner.

36:06.603 --> 36:08.671
She said she didn't want me
to miss this.

36:08.705 --> 36:10.789
Well, you know, I can't
thank you both enough.

36:10.809 --> 36:12.553
- It's means a lot to me.
- Well...

36:12.573 --> 36:14.911
It's not a problem, really.

36:14.945 --> 36:17.113
I gotta talk to you...

36:17.147 --> 36:19.248
'Cause clearly
you've lost your mind.

36:19.283 --> 36:21.450
don't, Tim.
Honestly...

36:21.484 --> 36:23.885
Do you think
this is easy for me?

36:23.920 --> 36:26.988
Huh? This is...
this is my family here, Tim.

36:27.023 --> 36:30.292
- This is my home, okay?
- Oh, that's good. Your home?

36:30.312 --> 36:32.391
Yeah.

36:33.198 --> 36:35.985
This is the hardest thing I've ever
had to do, so can you give me a break?

36:36.005 --> 36:38.596
Then do the right thing.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.368
I'm not sure what the
right thing is anymore-

36:40.402 --> 36:41.736
That's your
problem right there.

36:41.770 --> 36:43.606
- Okay, thanks.
- Dad, please.

36:43.626 --> 36:48.342
And here's our first
rider, Olivia Wheaton, riding Winner.

37:01.723 --> 37:04.324
What?! Are you kidding me?

37:04.359 --> 37:05.992
She did the reverse Fender drag!

37:06.026 --> 37:07.361
She stole my signature move!

37:07.395 --> 37:09.538
It's okay, Georgie.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.017
Beat that.

37:39.428 --> 37:43.127
Hey! What the hell do
you think you're doing?

37:43.531 --> 37:45.170
This land's gonna
be mine soon enough.

37:45.190 --> 37:47.467
I just wanna make sure
I get every square inch of it.

37:47.501 --> 37:49.949
You got no legal
right to be here.

37:49.969 --> 37:52.739
Come on, we both know Caleb's not
gonna come up with the cash in time.

37:52.773 --> 37:54.878
So pack up your stuff
and get out,

37:54.898 --> 37:57.550
'cause when I get the go ahead,
it's gonna happen real fast.

37:57.721 --> 38:00.462
I'm warning you. don't do this.

38:00.482 --> 38:01.848
Oh, I'm just getting started.

38:01.882 --> 38:03.658
What's that supposed to mean?

38:03.678 --> 38:05.552
It's called payback, Ty.

38:05.586 --> 38:08.358
I'm sticking it to Caleb,
reclaiming my family's land,

38:08.378 --> 38:09.987
and kicking you to the curb.

38:10.007 --> 38:11.817
Oh, and that stuck up fiancee
of yours

38:11.837 --> 38:13.460
who thinks she can just
blow me off?

38:13.494 --> 38:16.028
When I put her pathetic little
business out of operation,

38:16.063 --> 38:19.832
she's gonna wish she hadn't
turned down all my job offers.

38:20.699 --> 38:22.034
You lose, Ty.

38:22.069 --> 38:23.828
- Ungh!
- Agh!

38:23.848 --> 38:25.738
Ungh!

38:27.040 --> 38:28.941
Oh! Ungh!

38:32.045 --> 38:34.279
- Aggghhhhh!
- Oof!

38:36.683 --> 38:38.717
Hey! Stop!

38:38.752 --> 38:42.137
Get off him! Crazy!

38:44.557 --> 38:46.492
Get your hands off me!

38:46.526 --> 38:49.210
Take it easy!
Take easy, buddy! Come on!

38:49.536 --> 38:51.462
I got you now!

38:51.847 --> 38:54.918
You started this fight,
remember that.

38:57.312 --> 38:59.200
I can't
believe she did that!

38:59.220 --> 39:01.172
Just forget
about Olivia, okay?

39:01.207 --> 39:04.109
Focus on controlling
how you deal with this.

39:04.143 --> 39:05.610
- Just like we practiced.
- Next up, we have...

39:05.644 --> 39:07.578
- Okay...
- Are you ready?

39:07.613 --> 39:09.640
- Riding Checkers.
- I'm ready.

39:09.660 --> 39:11.212
Have fun.

39:11.232 --> 39:12.617
Woo!

39:49.926 --> 39:51.924
Oh no...

40:21.421 --> 40:23.225
Georgie, that was amazing!

40:23.245 --> 40:25.287
I can't believe
you tried that new trick!

40:25.321 --> 40:27.987
Well, I know it wasn't
perfect, but you said to have fun,

40:28.007 --> 40:30.096
and I didn't wanna regret
not trying it.

40:31.327 --> 40:33.529
Well, that was definitely
a winning ride.

40:35.586 --> 40:37.765
It doesn't look like it.

40:38.502 --> 40:41.182
Georgie, that was... incredible!

40:42.872 --> 40:45.306
Trying that stroud layout
was pretty gutsy, Georgie.

40:45.340 --> 40:47.274
It may have just tipped
the scales,

40:47.309 --> 40:49.677
because I am happy
to report that...

40:49.712 --> 40:52.179
you are being offered the spot
on the extreme team!

40:52.214 --> 40:54.048
Congratulations!

40:54.082 --> 40:56.062
You are gonna be a great
addition to the team!

41:02.721 --> 41:05.226
Hey... aw...

41:06.096 --> 41:08.203
Congratulations.

41:09.916 --> 41:11.939
I'm so proud of you!

41:22.715 --> 41:24.011
Ah...

41:33.643 --> 41:35.976
Ty, what's going on?
Where were you...?

41:38.098 --> 41:39.901
Oh my God.

41:41.650 --> 41:43.400
Are you okay?

41:45.956 --> 41:48.334
I think I
might be in trouble, Amy.

41:51.294 --> 41:53.205
So how's this gonna work?

41:53.239 --> 41:55.541
Well, your mom and I haven't
quite sorted it all out yet.

41:56.195 --> 41:58.297
Well... when are you
coming back?

41:58.317 --> 42:00.987
Soon. Very soon, okay?

42:01.007 --> 42:02.682
And I'm gonna call you tonight.

42:03.415 --> 42:05.723
Hey, kitty cat!

42:06.033 --> 42:08.753
Come here.
Oh, you're getting so big.

42:09.173 --> 42:11.662
Be a good girl for mommy, okay?
Daddy's gonna be back soon.

42:11.682 --> 42:13.933
Okay,
daddy, be back soon!

42:21.411 --> 42:23.686
Hey... look at me.

42:23.706 --> 42:26.164
We're gonna figure
this out, okay?

42:26.573 --> 42:28.673
I promise.

42:29.812 --> 42:30.609
I love you.

43:32.237 --> 43:33.669
On the next Heartland...

43:33.671 --> 43:34.503
You're under arrest.

43:34.505 --> 43:35.337
The wedding,

43:35.339 --> 43:36.578
is it on or off?

43:36.598 --> 43:38.303
I could go to jail
for a really long time.

43:38.323 --> 43:40.152
You drop the charges
and I'm all yours.

43:40.172 --> 43:43.006
Will they walk down
the aisle or run away from it?

43:43.026 --> 43:44.384
Let's get married, right now.

43:44.404 --> 43:47.369
Heartland,
next Sunday at 7:00 on CBC.
