there's no hard feelings.

00:08.173 --> 00:10.308
It's what you do, right?
Break up couples?

00:10.375 --> 00:12.042
But not this time.

00:12.094 --> 00:14.429
You screwed this up
all by yourself, didn't you?

00:14.513 --> 00:16.898
Is it true?
Are you going to prison?

00:16.982 --> 00:18.733
It's more like
a country club.

00:18.817 --> 00:21.185
It's <i>prison,</i> mother.

00:21.236 --> 00:23.020
How could you do this?

00:23.071 --> 00:25.189
Because you're my daughter,
and I love you.

00:25.240 --> 00:28.943
You look pretty.

00:29.027 --> 00:30.278

I'm in the middle of a crisis.
Can you please help me?

02:42.374 --> 02:43.924
Yes.
What's the matter?

02:43.992 --> 02:45.909
I just took my chocolate soufflé
out of the oven,

02:45.961 --> 02:47.278
and it fell.

02:47.345 --> 02:49.913
My guests get here
in 20 minutes.

02:49.965 --> 02:52.466
I'm sorry.
This is a <i>crisis</i> hotline.

02:52.534 --> 02:55.019
I'm having a <i>culinary</i> crisis.
Does that count?

02:57.922 --> 03:00.191
Okay, uh, do you have
any instant jello?

03:00.258 --> 03:01.275
Yes.

03:01.359 --> 03:02.426
Good,
make up the jello,

03:02.477 --> 03:03.777
layer it
with the whipped cream

03:03.862 --> 03:05.563
you were gonna use
for garnishing the soufflé,

03:05.614 --> 03:07.865
top it off with whatever fruit
you have lying around the house,

03:07.932 --> 03:09.233
and if you hurry,

03:09.284 --> 03:10.767
you can bang it out,
five minutes to spare.

03:10.819 --> 03:12.119
Thanks!
You're a life saver.

03:12.204 --> 03:15.623
Oh, yeah. Not quite
what I had in mind, but...

03:15.707 --> 03:17.291
Crisis intervention.

03:18.793 --> 03:22.163
This is not what I had in mind
when I said, "fix it."

03:22.247 --> 03:23.664
Oh, please.

03:23.748 --> 03:25.883
You're not the one who has to
wear this hideous jumpsuit.

03:25.950 --> 03:27.501
Orange?

03:27.586 --> 03:30.120
And we are
<i>far</i> from broke.

03:30.172 --> 03:32.139
In fact,
we have a lot of work to do.

03:33.341 --> 03:34.725
We may have saved
the company,

03:34.792 --> 03:36.343
but we are gonna have to
reorganize and streamline

03:36.428 --> 03:37.461
in just about
every division.

03:37.512 --> 03:39.647
Let's start
with the men's line.

03:41.299 --> 03:42.683
You're doing work?

03:42.767 --> 03:44.768
From in here?

03:44.819 --> 03:46.437
Of course.

03:46.488 --> 03:48.355
Brooke, many captains
of industry

03:48.440 --> 03:50.807
have done their best work
while incarcerated.

03:50.859 --> 03:52.193
There's no shame in it.

03:52.277 --> 03:54.445
Let's get a meeting
with the warden

03:54.496 --> 03:56.413
about these miserable
jumpsuits.

03:56.481 --> 03:58.532
That'll be all, Adele.

03:59.751 --> 04:01.452
She's better
than that Calliope.

04:01.503 --> 04:03.837
And besides, everyone in here
needs their own bitch.

04:03.922 --> 04:05.155
Mom!

04:05.207 --> 04:07.708
I'm just saying.
I did not make the rules.

04:07.792 --> 04:10.794
So, I think we can spin
this whole prison thing

04:10.845 --> 04:12.096
to our advantage.

04:12.163 --> 04:13.597
I want you to think
of an urban direction

04:13.665 --> 04:14.932

04:14.999 --> 04:17.767

I'm gonna have mad street credit

new digital camera.

05:15.142 --> 05:16.726
They're letting me
demo it.

05:16.793 --> 05:19.512
Turns out I'm on the "hot young
directors to watch" list.

05:19.596 --> 05:21.848
Oh. Well,
you are kind of hot.

05:22.966 --> 05:25.218

So, how is
public enemy number one?

05:28.238 --> 05:31.624
Oddly enough, she seems to be
adjusting to prison pretty well.

05:31.709 --> 05:33.943
She might actually be
enjoying herself.

05:33.994 --> 05:35.244
Me?

05:35.295 --> 05:36.963
I have to jettison
the men's line,

05:37.047 --> 05:39.716
reorganize the magazine staff,
close half of our stores,

05:39.783 --> 05:43.753

Excuse me?

08:44.897 --> 08:48.733

it's either a truth or a dare.

Your pick.

08:50.586 --> 08:52.404
Let's make it a dare.

Okay.

08:54.240 --> 08:55.674
Loser plays the next hole
in their underwear.

08:55.741 --> 08:57.676
Yeah...

08:57.743 --> 09:00.178
Like I'm wearing
any underwear.

09:07.720 --> 09:11.089
Alex Dupré,
my girlfriend.

09:18.264 --> 09:20.032
This could get
interesting.

09:21.901 --> 09:24.036
I don't know.

09:24.103 --> 09:26.822
I thought that the people
who would be calling in

09:26.906 --> 09:29.241
would be struggling,
like I was, you know?

09:29.292 --> 09:31.126
And that's not
what's happening?

09:31.210 --> 09:34.162
No, but if I need to start
a 976 line or a cooking show,

09:34.247 --> 09:35.547
I'm golden.

09:37.283 --> 09:39.117
I don't think
I've helped anybody.

09:39.168 --> 09:42.620
Well, it only takes one person,
you know?

09:42.672 --> 09:44.556
And at some point,
you're gonna pick up that phone,

09:44.623 --> 09:47.008
and the person on the other end
is really gonna need you.

09:47.093 --> 09:49.428
And you know what?
What?

09:49.512 --> 09:52.481
They're gonna be lucky
it was you who answered.

09:54.100 --> 09:56.301
Hey, speaking
of helping people,

09:56.352 --> 09:58.470
I've discussed it
with Nathan,

09:58.521 --> 10:00.138
and we both decided
that it would be best

10:00.189 --> 10:02.774
if you move in with us
now that you're coming home.

10:02.825 --> 10:03.975
Just for a little while,

10:04.026 --> 10:05.360
at least until Clay
is doing better.

10:05.445 --> 10:07.662
And you're sure
it won't be too much trouble?

10:07.747 --> 10:09.831
Only if you argue with me.

10:09.916 --> 10:12.650
Then I'd like that
very much.

10:15.004 --> 10:17.255
Who's ready to be released?

10:17.323 --> 10:19.124
Is that
really necessary?

10:20.376 --> 10:22.344
Sorry, honey.
It's hospital policy.

10:22.428 --> 10:24.429
I'll make sure she doesn't
make a break for it.
I got it from here.

10:24.497 --> 10:25.514
Okay.

10:32.188 --> 10:34.439
Are you ready to go home?

10:34.507 --> 10:35.724
Yeah.

10:42.899 --> 10:45.016
You okay?
Sorry.

10:45.067 --> 10:47.569
Yeah, it's just,
um...

10:47.653 --> 10:49.955
After the shooting,
when you were unconscious,

10:50.022 --> 10:52.741
I prayed for this moment
when you would come home to me.

10:52.825 --> 10:54.359
After losing mom,

10:54.410 --> 10:56.962
the thought of that
not happening was just...

10:57.029 --> 10:59.581
I know.

10:59.665 --> 11:01.883
I love you.

11:01.968 --> 11:03.868

11:03.920 --> 11:06.221

11:06.305 --> 11:07.889
Yes, please.

11:07.974 --> 11:09.891
Okay.

11:20.069 --> 11:23.054
Ahh!
That feels sweet.

11:23.105 --> 11:25.073
That's another hole
for me.

11:25.158 --> 11:27.526
You owe me a truth,
so pony up, girlfriend.

11:27.577 --> 11:28.944
What kind of truth?

11:29.028 --> 11:31.363
Tell me a secret,

11:31.414 --> 11:33.081
something you've never,
ever told anyone.

11:34.733 --> 11:37.002
I've never been in love.

11:37.069 --> 11:39.254
I mean, I've had
tons of boyfriends,

11:39.338 --> 11:41.840
and some of them
I genuinely liked, but...

11:41.907 --> 11:44.576
I've never been in love.

11:44.627 --> 11:46.511
I've never had
that one special person.

11:46.579 --> 11:48.246
I think I know
what love is,

11:48.297 --> 11:49.764
what it should be,
you know?

11:49.849 --> 11:52.851
At least I...

11:52.918 --> 11:55.971
I know enough to know
I've never felt it before.

11:56.055 --> 11:58.607
Well, you might not have ever
been in love with them,

11:58.691 --> 12:00.692
all those other guys
that you've dated,

12:00.759 --> 12:04.446
but...I can't imagine
they weren't in love with <i>you.</i>

12:04.530 --> 12:06.398
Think so?

12:06.449 --> 12:08.149
Yeah. I do.

12:08.234 --> 12:11.653
You know, you're a lot sweeter
than I thought you'd be.

12:11.737 --> 12:14.372
Mm. You haven't heard
my next dare.

12:14.440 --> 12:16.741
Oh! Come on!

12:27.086 --> 12:30.388
Oh, Julian.

12:30.456 --> 12:33.592
What fairy tale
did you bring me to?

12:33.643 --> 12:34.959
This is
the Biltmore estate.

12:35.011 --> 12:37.178
I thought it would be
a nice spot for our wedding.

12:37.246 --> 12:40.932
I want my girl
to have her dream.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.467
It's beautiful.

12:44.153 --> 12:47.138
But is this okay?

12:47.189 --> 12:49.024
I mean,
with everything going on,

12:49.091 --> 12:50.492
this wouldn't be selfish?

12:50.576 --> 12:53.978
No.

12:54.030 --> 12:55.363
No, and know why?

12:55.448 --> 12:58.833
Because years from now, when
we look back on this moment,

12:58.918 --> 13:02.203
we not gonna remember
the trouble with your company,

13:02.288 --> 13:05.323
or the bad press,
or even your mom being in jail.

13:07.376 --> 13:10.545
We're just gonna remember
how great our wedding was.

13:12.381 --> 13:14.549
You think so?

13:14.617 --> 13:18.970
Yeah.
I know so.

13:19.021 --> 13:21.523
And when we look back
on it...

13:21.607 --> 13:23.858
I want to remember it
like this --

13:23.943 --> 13:26.444
just...Perfect.

13:29.949 --> 13:32.067
You of all people
deserve it.

♪ I've waited for you all day ♪

13:38.190 --> 13:42.711
♪ I've waited for you all day ♪

13:42.795 --> 13:45.647

13:50.783 --> 13:53.785
Hey, Quinn told me about
what you were gonna do.

13:53.836 --> 13:57.255
Donating a kidney
and ruining your career?

13:57.306 --> 14:01.092
That has to rate
as one of your worst moves ever.

14:01.143 --> 14:02.894
What were you thinking,
Nate?

14:02.962 --> 14:05.146
I was thinking
you were gonna die.

14:05.231 --> 14:07.148
And that was
completely unacceptable to me.

14:07.233 --> 14:08.767
I love you for that, buddy,
but...

14:08.834 --> 14:11.419
It would've killed me
if you threw it all away for me.

14:11.487 --> 14:12.821
It's a game.

14:12.888 --> 14:14.990
Clay, some things
are more important.

14:15.074 --> 14:18.660
And truth be told,
it wasn't even a hard decision.

14:18.744 --> 14:20.161
No big deal.

14:21.998 --> 14:24.115
Hey...

14:24.166 --> 14:27.702
It <i>was</i> a big deal.

14:27.787 --> 14:30.154
I mean,
it's a <i>really</i> big deal.

14:32.157 --> 14:33.024
Thank you.

14:37.346 --> 14:39.014
Yeah.

14:43.285 --> 14:44.786
<i>Ohh!</i>

14:44.854 --> 14:48.006
<i>And that shot spells disaster</i>
<i>for Daniels on the 18th.</i>

14:55.564 --> 14:56.898
This is
kind of a disaster.

14:56.983 --> 14:58.984
What?
You're not having fun?

14:59.051 --> 15:01.319
No. It's not that.
It's just...

15:01.370 --> 15:03.655
I kind of suck.

15:03.706 --> 15:05.690
You do not suck.
Come on.

15:05.741 --> 15:07.409
You're just saying
that because you want
to sleep with me.

15:07.493 --> 15:09.160
I am not.

15:09.211 --> 15:11.246
You don't want
to sleep with me?

15:11.330 --> 15:13.048
No, I do.

15:13.132 --> 15:14.165
I mean...

15:14.216 --> 15:15.800
I don't.

15:15.868 --> 15:16.835
Do or don't --
make up your mind.

15:16.886 --> 15:18.970
Can you just hit?

15:24.794 --> 15:26.678
Bad for you.

15:26.729 --> 15:28.146
Good for me.

15:34.353 --> 15:36.354
I'm sorry.
We're closed.

15:36.405 --> 15:38.723
Yeah, I-I know.

15:38.791 --> 15:41.276
Well, if you're press,
I have no comment.

15:41.343 --> 15:42.393
No.

15:42.445 --> 15:44.062
I'm not press.

15:44.113 --> 15:46.781
I'm actually just an investor
who believed in your company.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.918
Oh.

15:52.571 --> 15:55.573
We did hit a rough patch,

15:55.624 --> 15:58.259
but I think that the company
is gonna be okay.

15:58.344 --> 16:03.882
We are completely restructuring,
and we will recover.

16:03.933 --> 16:05.467
Well...

16:08.137 --> 16:10.472
This is a picture
of my daughter...

16:10.556 --> 16:11.439
Faith.

16:14.143 --> 16:17.195
She's lovely.

16:17.263 --> 16:20.598
She's a great student,
a self-starter.

16:20.649 --> 16:23.451
In fact she just got accepted
to college

16:23.536 --> 16:26.671
and was gonna study
fashion design, just like you.

16:28.491 --> 16:31.543
I never really got a chance
to go to college myself,

16:31.610 --> 16:33.444
but what I did,
miss Davis,

16:33.496 --> 16:36.047
was I worked and I saved
most of my life

16:36.115 --> 16:39.918
to make sure
she'd be able to go.

16:39.969 --> 16:42.887
That's very nice.

16:42.955 --> 16:45.006
Well, I just wanted a chance
to meet you,

16:45.091 --> 16:49.894
and I really wanted you to have
a chance to see her picture,

16:49.962 --> 16:52.764
because you're the reason
I have to tell her tonight

16:52.815 --> 16:55.033
she won't be going to college
after all.

16:55.101 --> 16:57.819
What do you mean?

16:57.903 --> 17:01.806
I invested a hell of a lot
of money with you, miss Davis.

17:01.857 --> 17:07.244
And my money's gone
because you lied to us.

17:07.311 --> 17:10.281
You lied.

17:10.332 --> 17:12.983
And you should be ashamed
of yourself.

17:13.035 --> 17:14.935
Sir, please wait.

17:15.003 --> 17:19.490
But, uh, you know, I'm glad
your company's gonna be okay.

17:20.960 --> 17:24.179
Wish I could say the same
for my little girl.

17:36.142 --> 17:37.392
Well, what kind of idiot

17:37.476 --> 17:39.561
invests everything they have
in a clothing line?

17:39.645 --> 17:42.530
The kind that trusted us.

17:42.615 --> 17:46.151
They gambled on us,
and it didn't work out.

17:46.202 --> 17:48.786
And when it didn't,
somebody had to take the hit.

17:48.854 --> 17:50.188
Just be grateful
it's not us.

17:50.239 --> 17:52.574
I want to pay them back.

17:52.658 --> 17:53.791
You can't,

17:53.859 --> 17:56.077
not without losing
the company entirely.

17:56.162 --> 17:57.378
We'd have to sell.

17:57.463 --> 17:58.379
Maybe we should.

18:00.199 --> 18:01.716
Don't be crazy.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.918
You want to throw away
everything we've built

18:04.003 --> 18:06.004
just to pay back
every Tom, Dick, and Harry

18:06.055 --> 18:07.972
who's ever invested
in clothes over bros?

18:08.040 --> 18:09.507
Yes.

18:09.558 --> 18:11.476
They are people, mother.

18:11.543 --> 18:13.711
People with wives
and husbands and children,

18:13.762 --> 18:15.230
and they trusted us.

18:15.314 --> 18:18.266
And for the record,
they didn't invest in a <i>company.</i>

18:18.350 --> 18:19.817
They invested in <i>me.</i>

18:19.885 --> 18:22.403
Brooke Davis.

18:22.488 --> 18:24.555
Don't do this, Brooke.

18:24.607 --> 18:27.558
If you do, it'll be the biggest
mistake of your life!

18:32.164 --> 18:33.731
You ready?

18:33.782 --> 18:35.200
No.

18:35.251 --> 18:36.400
What do you mean?

18:36.452 --> 18:37.919
You're finally
getting out of here.

18:38.003 --> 18:40.305
I know. It just feels wrong,
leaving without you.

18:40.372 --> 18:41.539
Aw, come on.

18:41.607 --> 18:43.625
I'll be right behind you.
I promise.

18:43.692 --> 18:45.210
I'll call you every night.

18:45.261 --> 18:47.545
And I'll come visit you
every day, okay?

18:47.596 --> 18:49.764
I'm gonna hold you
to that.

18:52.768 --> 18:54.969
We made it, Quinn.

18:56.889 --> 19:01.092
I love you, and we're gonna
be together soon.

but I think my drive might be
slightly better than yours.

19:50.403 --> 19:53.872
You're such a show-off.

19:53.923 --> 19:55.040
It's no fair.

19:55.091 --> 19:56.875
Where'd you learn
to play so well?

19:56.926 --> 19:58.243
Well...

19:59.429 --> 20:01.130
Golf team.
High School.

20:01.214 --> 20:03.882
Ha ha!
You in High School.

20:03.933 --> 20:05.934
I wish I could've seen you
back then.

20:06.019 --> 20:07.319
I was a little different.

20:07.387 --> 20:08.487
Wait.
Don't tell me.

20:08.555 --> 20:09.855
Let me guess.

20:09.922 --> 20:11.423
You were way cute.

20:11.474 --> 20:15.444
Kind of a good student
until your a.D.D. Kicked in.

20:15.528 --> 20:19.164
You didn't hang with the jocks,
but you weren't a geek.

20:19.232 --> 20:22.651
You were more of a skater boy,
and people liked you.

20:22.735 --> 20:24.769
And the nice girls
secretly crushed on you.

20:24.821 --> 20:25.854
How'd I do?

20:25.922 --> 20:27.573
No girls crushed on me.

20:27.640 --> 20:28.991
I said "secretly."

20:29.075 --> 20:32.711
<i>No</i> girls crushed on me.

20:32.778 --> 20:34.913
I was a clean teen.

20:34.964 --> 20:36.999
A what?

20:38.334 --> 20:41.420
A clean teen.
Virgin for life.

20:42.972 --> 20:45.790
Wow. I didn't see that
with my crystal ball.

20:45.842 --> 20:47.326
Why?

20:47.393 --> 20:51.129
I wanted the first time
to mean something.

20:51.181 --> 20:52.964
So, um...

20:53.066 --> 20:55.150
How'd it go for you?

20:55.235 --> 20:56.801
I let the clean teens down.

20:59.856 --> 21:02.908
I did, however, skate.
I loved it.

21:02.975 --> 21:05.744
See? I knew
I was right about you.

21:05.811 --> 21:09.581
All right.
Let's play some golf.

21:09.649 --> 21:11.583
Why are we stopping?

21:11.651 --> 21:14.286
This is you.
This is how far your drive went.

21:14.337 --> 21:17.756
Okay, so maybe your drive <i>was</i>
<i>a little better than mine.</i>

21:19.843 --> 21:22.528
And I think I was right about
those girls crushing on you.

21:22.595 --> 21:24.546
But if I wasn't,

21:24.631 --> 21:27.599
I know one that's crushing
pretty hard right now.

21:36.309 --> 21:39.010
It's quiet around here.

21:39.062 --> 21:41.113
Where's Jamie?

21:41.180 --> 21:44.066
Jamie has a playdate
with Chuck.

21:44.150 --> 21:45.517
I just wanted
to make sure

21:45.568 --> 21:47.236
everything was
really peaceful for you

21:47.320 --> 21:48.370
when you got home.

21:48.454 --> 21:49.655
Hales, that's nice,

21:49.706 --> 21:51.356
but you don't have to
change things around here

21:51.407 --> 21:53.191
because of me.

21:53.243 --> 21:55.127
You know, I can --
I can get this.

21:55.194 --> 21:56.528
No, you -- I --

21:56.579 --> 22:00.532
no, I can get this myself.
I'm -- look, I'm fine, really.

22:00.583 --> 22:02.334
The doctor said that
he wants you to take it easy

22:02.385 --> 22:03.585
for right now, okay?

22:03.670 --> 22:05.504
And that's exactly what
we're gonna do.

22:05.555 --> 22:07.055
I've got your room
all set up.

22:07.140 --> 22:08.873
I'm gonna cook you
a really nice dinner,

22:08.925 --> 22:11.643
and everything will perfect.

22:11.711 --> 22:13.545
Oh, I forgot.

22:13.596 --> 22:15.647
I wanted to call Nathan
to make sure he stops
by the beach house

22:15.715 --> 22:18.317
to get the rest
of your things.

Yeah, I'll stop by
when I'm done with Clay.

22:27.327 --> 22:28.777
Yeah, I love you, too.

22:28.861 --> 22:31.363
Bye.

22:31.414 --> 22:33.999
You've got an amazing wife,
Mr. Scott.

22:35.501 --> 22:37.753
You play your cards right,
you might have one, too.

22:37.837 --> 22:39.338
No, I'm serious.

22:39.405 --> 22:41.373
Haley's got things here
under control.

22:41.424 --> 22:43.241
You should go to camp.

22:43.293 --> 22:44.593
It's important.

22:44.661 --> 22:46.762
So is this.

22:46.846 --> 22:47.912
Nate...

22:47.964 --> 22:49.848
Quinn's home.

22:49.915 --> 22:51.633
I'm gonna be
out of here soon.

22:51.718 --> 22:53.919
But the game
is not gonna wait for you.

22:53.987 --> 22:57.756
You've got to get back
to camp.

22:57.807 --> 23:00.425
Ooh, more flowers --
very nice!

23:00.476 --> 23:01.777
Who are these from?

23:01.861 --> 23:04.262
They're from me and Brooke
for Quinn.

23:04.314 --> 23:06.448
Of course they're from Brooke.
They're the nicest.

23:06.532 --> 23:08.116
She's such a girl.

23:08.201 --> 23:10.435
Thank you.
Yeah.

23:10.486 --> 23:11.620
Hi.
Hi.

23:11.704 --> 23:12.871
How's Quinn doing?

23:12.938 --> 23:14.873
She's good.
I'm just glad she's home.

23:14.940 --> 23:16.541
You know?
Yeah.

23:16.609 --> 23:19.294
So, uh,
where's the little guy?
He's at a playdate.

23:19.379 --> 23:22.414
Damn! I was hoping you'd let me
kidnap him for the afternoon.

23:22.465 --> 23:23.548
Aww, that's so sweet.

23:23.616 --> 23:25.083
He loves hanging out
with you and Brooke.

23:25.134 --> 23:27.886
In fact -- and I guess
this is really why I'm here --

23:27.953 --> 23:29.888
I know you have a lot going on
right now.

23:29.955 --> 23:32.007
You know, you need anything,
anything at all,

23:32.091 --> 23:34.793
we want you guys to just
pick up the phone. Okay?

23:34.844 --> 23:36.645
Thank you. We will.

23:36.713 --> 23:39.147
Good. Okay.

23:39.232 --> 23:41.483
All right.
I got to go.

23:41.567 --> 23:45.303
Um, tell Jamie hi,
and give our best to Quinn.

23:45.355 --> 23:46.321
I will. Thanks.

23:49.108 --> 23:51.743
I picked out the flowers,
by the way.

23:51.811 --> 23:53.612
<i>You</i> did?
Yeah.

23:53.663 --> 23:55.280
I'm sorry.
I didn't reali--

23:55.331 --> 23:57.666
they're -- I mean, gee,
you did a beautiful job.

23:57.750 --> 23:58.834
Yeah?
Yeah.

23:58.918 --> 24:00.652
I mean, I was hoping
for calla lilies,

24:00.703 --> 24:02.421
but I had to settle
for regular lilies.

24:02.488 --> 24:04.506
I think the snapdragons
really complement them.

24:04.590 --> 24:07.092
In my mind, they really make
the arrangement.

24:08.544 --> 24:11.496
I'm just...
Going to go.

24:16.386 --> 24:18.887
Let me see.

24:18.971 --> 24:23.942
You owe me four dinners,
three breakfasts in bed,

24:24.009 --> 24:26.611
a bunch of lap dances,
and a car Wash.

24:26.679 --> 24:29.114
It's the last hole.
Let's make it a good one.

24:29.181 --> 24:30.532
What are we playing for?

24:30.616 --> 24:33.485
Loser does
whatever the winner wants.

24:33.536 --> 24:34.986
No questions asked.

24:35.038 --> 24:36.988
That's big.

24:37.040 --> 24:38.356
Very big.

Oh. Anybody been
out there since --

28:17.031 --> 28:18.916
no.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.584
And I'll tell you
something.

28:20.669 --> 28:22.753
You walk into something
like that,

28:22.837 --> 28:25.005
and suddenly
all your own problems

28:25.056 --> 28:27.308
don't seem
like such a big deal.

28:27.375 --> 28:29.593
Yeah.

28:29.678 --> 28:32.179
Well, I got next round.

28:32.230 --> 28:33.814
Can I get
a couple beers here?

28:36.284 --> 28:38.836
Look, I've been meaning
to thank you.

28:38.903 --> 28:40.988
For what?
For spending time
with Jamie.

28:41.055 --> 28:43.107
Oh.

28:43.191 --> 28:45.442
Don't mention it.
He's a great kid.

28:46.911 --> 28:50.197
We've been playing baseball.
Kid totally fixed my swing.

28:50.248 --> 28:52.533
He's great.
He loves it, so...

28:52.584 --> 28:54.201
Nice work, dad.

28:55.253 --> 28:57.087
Baseball, huh?

28:57.172 --> 28:58.672
Yep, of course,
he told me

28:58.740 --> 29:01.074
he's gonna play basketball
like his old man does.

29:03.044 --> 29:05.579
You mean
like his old man used to.

29:05.630 --> 29:07.965
What?

29:08.049 --> 29:10.467
I've been avoiding it now
for a while,

29:10.552 --> 29:14.972
but, uh...My back is done.

29:15.056 --> 29:16.724
So...

29:16.775 --> 29:19.059
I'm gonna finish this beer,
and then I'm gonna go home

29:19.110 --> 29:20.927
and tell my wife
that I'm done playing.

29:23.982 --> 29:26.817
Wow.

29:26.901 --> 29:28.385
That's huge.

29:28.453 --> 29:30.604
When did you decide that?

29:30.655 --> 29:33.440
Just this second.

29:33.491 --> 29:34.491
Why?

29:36.411 --> 29:39.163
Haley's pregnant.

29:39.247 --> 29:40.798
Clay and Quinn
are recovering,

29:40.865 --> 29:44.835
and, uh...

29:44.919 --> 29:47.304
I didn't even know
my own son liked baseball.

29:53.961 --> 29:55.979
Listen, um...

29:56.064 --> 29:58.565
Give Brooke my best.

29:58.633 --> 30:00.484
And tell her I said

30:00.568 --> 30:02.135
not to be afraid
of what comes next.

30:02.187 --> 30:04.054

30:18.503 --> 30:20.838

chicken and dumpling soup,

30:20.922 --> 30:22.506
just the way
mom used to make it.

30:22.590 --> 30:23.624
What?

30:28.379 --> 30:29.713
Are you okay?

30:29.781 --> 30:31.298
Yeah.

30:31.349 --> 30:33.834
You know, some people
are clearly just angels

30:33.885 --> 30:36.503
sent down to earth
to take care of the rest of us.

30:36.554 --> 30:40.424
I'm just lucky that one
of those angels is my sister.

30:40.492 --> 30:43.193
Thank you.

30:51.569 --> 30:53.454
Hey.

30:53.521 --> 30:55.706
Haley says
Quinn loved the flowers.

30:58.076 --> 31:00.627
What's wrong?

31:00.695 --> 31:04.248
I'm gonna lose my company.

31:04.332 --> 31:07.367
What do you mean?
I thought Victoria fixed it.

31:07.418 --> 31:09.303
She did.

31:09.370 --> 31:11.088
And you know how?

31:11.172 --> 31:15.375
By screwing our investors.

31:15.426 --> 31:20.180
We are surviving at the expense
of all these people

31:20.231 --> 31:23.884
who put their hard-earned
savings in our hands.

31:23.935 --> 31:25.102
Okay, well...

31:25.186 --> 31:27.404
There's got to be
some other way out.

31:27.472 --> 31:30.407
I've gone over everything.

31:30.492 --> 31:31.692
There isn't.

31:35.730 --> 31:40.784
How can I set foot
in my store,

31:40.869 --> 31:43.337
in our offices,

31:43.404 --> 31:48.458
knowing that I kept them
by deceiving people?

31:48.543 --> 31:51.261
I can't.

32:52.073 --> 32:53.991
I wanted to say thank you.

For staying.

32:56.027 --> 32:57.911
I don't know
what I would've done.

32:57.979 --> 33:00.080
I don't know how I would've
gotten through all this

33:00.147 --> 33:01.365
without you.

33:01.449 --> 33:04.952
I couldn't imagine being
any place else right now.

33:05.003 --> 33:07.621
So, when do you leave
for camp?

33:07.672 --> 33:10.540
I don't.

33:10.625 --> 33:11.842
I'm not going to.

33:14.045 --> 33:16.763
I've been thinking a lot
about this,

33:16.831 --> 33:21.184
and I feel like my back
is just too much of a risk.

33:21.269 --> 33:22.769
And obviously,

33:22.837 --> 33:24.805
this is a decision
we have to make together.

33:24.856 --> 33:27.507
'Cause if I retire,
our life is gonna change.

33:30.778 --> 33:32.145
Wow.

33:32.196 --> 33:33.897
Yeah.

33:33.982 --> 33:36.316
Okay.
Well, what do you want?

33:40.187 --> 33:43.824
I made it to the league,
you know?

33:43.875 --> 33:46.076
I had a dream,
and I lived it,

33:46.160 --> 33:50.130
and that is more
than most people ever get.

33:50.197 --> 33:52.165
I just -- I have this voice
in my head

33:52.250 --> 33:54.418
that keeps saying,
"walk away from the game

33:54.502 --> 33:56.670
while you can still walk away
from the game."

33:56.721 --> 33:58.371
And I just --

33:58.423 --> 34:01.207
I want to be healthy
for you and Jamie and the baby,

34:01.259 --> 34:03.844
so even if that means
never playing again...

34:03.895 --> 34:05.929
Then that's what I want.

34:06.014 --> 34:08.565
Because if there's one thing
I've learned from all this,

34:08.650 --> 34:10.484
it's that money and things
don't matter.

34:10.551 --> 34:13.103
It's just...Us.

34:13.187 --> 34:14.905
And our family.

34:14.989 --> 34:18.492
Then I guess you better get used
to having me around.

34:21.329 --> 34:22.696
Are you okay --

34:22.746 --> 34:25.165
I mean, are you gonna be okay
with this?

34:25.232 --> 34:27.534
I'll be fine.

34:27.585 --> 34:29.753

for the rest of my life,

34:29.837 --> 34:32.255

I get to spend it with you.

34:47.029 --> 34:48.746

from the beach house.

34:53.568 --> 34:54.835

34:59.675 --> 35:00.792

to be the best strategy.

37:18.597 --> 37:20.431
I'm not sure
if I should be calling.

37:20.516 --> 37:22.316
I'm having a hard time,

37:22.384 --> 37:25.103
and I just needed someone
to talk to.

37:25.187 --> 37:26.771
Okay.

37:26.855 --> 37:28.523
What's your name?

37:28.574 --> 37:30.324
Do I have to give my name?

37:30.392 --> 37:31.609
No.

37:31.693 --> 37:34.445
I'd rather not.

37:34.530 --> 37:38.916
Uh, well, why don't you
tell me what's wrong?

37:39.001 --> 37:40.451
Well,
that's why I'm not sure

37:40.536 --> 37:42.653
if this is where
I should be calling.

37:42.721 --> 37:44.255
Because it's...

37:44.339 --> 37:48.726
It's sort of everything,
and it's nothing.

37:48.794 --> 37:53.164
I mean, when I think of my life
and who I am...

37:53.232 --> 37:57.051
I guess I'm just struggling
to believe in it all, you know?

37:57.102 --> 37:59.270
That good things
will happen to good people,

37:59.354 --> 38:02.907
that things will work out,

38:02.975 --> 38:05.460
that it gets better.

38:05.527 --> 38:07.478
Are you still there?

38:07.563 --> 38:08.946
Yes.

38:09.031 --> 38:10.698
Maybe this was a mistake.

38:10.765 --> 38:12.984
No. It wasn't.

38:13.068 --> 38:15.119
This is exactly where
you should be calling.

38:18.290 --> 38:19.340
Tell me
what you're afraid of

38:19.408 --> 38:21.775
and what makes you feel
like this.

38:21.827 --> 38:24.979
Failure, I guess.

38:25.047 --> 38:26.380
So, you see,

38:26.448 --> 38:27.915
even if you were to liquidate
all the company's assets,

38:27.966 --> 38:30.284
you'd only be able
to pay back your investors

38:30.335 --> 38:31.636
70% of what they lost.

38:31.720 --> 38:34.972
What if I need it
to be 100%?

38:35.057 --> 38:37.791
Well,
that's just not possible.

38:37.843 --> 38:40.394
Where would you secure
the cash reserves?

38:40.462 --> 38:43.898
What if I liquidate
everything?

38:45.567 --> 38:48.319
Are we talking about
your personal fortune?

38:48.403 --> 38:51.472
Everything I have.

38:51.523 --> 38:53.641
Everything I own.

38:53.692 --> 38:56.160
Will that do it?

38:58.313 --> 39:00.064
Yes.

39:06.288 --> 39:08.372
Do it.

39:26.942 --> 39:29.176
We all struggle.
It's part of life.

39:29.228 --> 39:30.811
It's part of living.

39:30.862 --> 39:32.980
Mm.
What are you doing here?

39:33.031 --> 39:35.700
You should be home in bed.

39:35.784 --> 39:38.452
<i>We</i> should be in bed.

39:38.520 --> 39:40.154
Do you have anybody
that can help you

39:40.205 --> 39:42.206
while you struggle?

39:42.291 --> 39:44.709
No.

39:44.793 --> 39:49.363
And that's the worst part --
the loneliness.

39:52.217 --> 39:56.470
A crushing, black loneliness
that makes me feel like --

39:56.538 --> 39:59.223
like there's no magic left
in the world.

40:51.193 --> 40:54.228
I know
the future is scary.

40:54.279 --> 40:56.230
I know the world
can be threatening.

40:59.423 --> 41:00.941
But you should know

41:01.025 --> 41:04.528
that sometimes when things
seem most the desperate,

41:04.595 --> 41:07.864
people find you.

41:07.932 --> 41:09.700
Help is out there.

41:09.767 --> 41:12.268
