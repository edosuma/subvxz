00:06.005 --> 00:07.840
[alarm chiming]

00:13.680 --> 00:15.932
[alarm continues chiming]

00:21.521 --> 00:22.522
[chiming stops]

00:22.605 --> 00:25.942
Well, it's about time, okay?
Thing's been going off for ten minutes.

00:35.577 --> 00:36.869
[grunts]

00:36.953 --> 00:39.331
Come on. He'll be here any second.

00:40.623 --> 00:42.500
You haven't told him
you can't do this stuff on your own?

00:42.584 --> 00:44.586
Once I'm better, I won't need to.

00:48.131 --> 00:49.882
I get it, okay? [sighs]

00:49.966 --> 00:53.636
My girl, she bolted once she saw me use
a bedpan one too many times.

00:55.347 --> 00:57.474
Am I interrupting something?

00:57.557 --> 01:00.518
Just Oli professing his love.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.067
I have a surprise.

01:07.984 --> 01:10.903
Remember how we talked about
going to Europe?

01:12.572 --> 01:13.698
A backpacking trip?

01:13.781 --> 01:16.368
My grandparents got it for me
as a graduation gift.

01:16.451 --> 01:18.035
It's our chance to relive Paris.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.122
-It's everything we dreamed about.
-I know.

01:20.205 --> 01:22.165
I can't wait to start planning.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.210
[grunting]

01:25.293 --> 01:26.794
Whoa, you okay?

01:27.837 --> 01:29.589
[sighs] Um...

01:30.590 --> 01:32.717
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:32.800 --> 01:33.801
[chuckles]

01:38.640 --> 01:43.853
♪ Whatever it takes
I know I can make it through ♪

01:44.937 --> 01:49.609
♪ And if I hold out
I know I can make it through ♪

01:53.946 --> 01:58.993
♪ Be the best, be the best
The best that I can be ♪

01:59.076 --> 02:01.704
♪ Whatever it takes ♪

02:01.788 --> 02:05.500
♪ I know I can make it
I know I can make it through ♪

02:11.631 --> 02:13.341
[both chuckle] Ooh!

02:15.009 --> 02:16.844
You totally have that post-sex glow!

02:16.928 --> 02:19.889
How was it? Amazing?
Mind-blowing? Even better?

02:19.972 --> 02:21.098
-[Lola chuckles]
-All of the above?

02:21.183 --> 02:23.810
I don't know. Like, I feel different now,
but kinda the same?

02:23.893 --> 02:25.603
Sex changes everything.

02:25.687 --> 02:28.064
See? He can't even leave you alone now
for a millisecond.

02:28.148 --> 02:31.609
"Day 43, the night we picnicked
under the stars." [chuckles]

02:32.735 --> 02:34.321
-What are these?
-[chuckles]

02:35.363 --> 02:38.450
[Lola] "The night we shared ice cream"?
They eat a lot of food.

02:38.533 --> 02:39.826
[Lola laughs]

02:48.167 --> 02:49.461
[Lola gasps]

02:58.303 --> 03:02.056
Rasha, you make every day one to remember.

03:02.139 --> 03:04.726
Will you help make prom day
just as special?

03:04.809 --> 03:06.102
Aw!

03:06.185 --> 03:08.980
Just imagine how amazing
your promposal's gonna be!

03:09.063 --> 03:10.773
Mmm, I don't know.
Is Tiny really the kind of guy

03:10.857 --> 03:12.024
who'd do something big like that?

03:12.108 --> 03:14.319
-How do you think he'll do it?
-Maybe in science class?

03:14.402 --> 03:16.446
-That's where we first talked.
-[Lola] You're so lucky.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.155
I wish I had a senior boyfriend
to ask me to prom.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.242
Maybe he'll get, like, a little armadillo?

03:20.325 --> 03:22.159
-That was our thing.
-[Lola sighs]

03:22.244 --> 03:24.954
-What? Winston once got you a goat.
-[chuckles]

03:25.037 --> 03:26.414
You used to be so shy.

03:26.498 --> 03:29.376
Now look at you, waiting for your huge
romantic spectacle.

03:29.459 --> 03:31.961
I guess you're right.
Sex really does change everything.

03:32.044 --> 03:33.630
[Lola and Frankie chuckle]

03:38.343 --> 03:43.180
Oh, is that a Parisian suite
for us to eat, pray and mostly love in?

03:43.265 --> 03:46.559
[chuckles] Well, actually,
for the full European experience,

03:46.643 --> 03:48.395
-I was thinking--
-[Maya] Hostels?

03:48.978 --> 03:51.939
You guys are gonna fly halfway
around the planet to have roommates?

03:52.023 --> 03:56.319
Or interesting people from
all around the world. That could be fun.

03:56.403 --> 03:59.822
Don't worry, there will still be
plenty of time for love.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.491
Like at the top of the Eiffel Tower.

04:03.159 --> 04:05.537
-You guys, it sounds like an amazing trip.
-I know.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.622
Six months ago,
this wouldn't have been possible.

04:07.705 --> 04:09.666
Now, it is.

04:09.749 --> 04:11.125
I want everything to be perfect.

04:12.877 --> 04:15.087
Here, let me grab the study sheets.

04:18.049 --> 04:20.176
Do you know how many steps it takes
to climb the Eiffel Tower?

04:20.260 --> 04:22.136
It has elevators.

04:22.219 --> 04:24.806
Plus, I'm getting better,
so I'll be able to do it. [chuckles]

04:24.889 --> 04:26.558
Is that what your doctors say?

04:28.393 --> 04:31.396
Your special accommodation room
for tomorrow's test is set up.

04:31.479 --> 04:35.191
Actually, I... I think I'm ready
to take it with the rest of the class.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.445
Oh. Okay, well, let's review, then!

04:39.362 --> 04:40.863
Question one.

04:41.614 --> 04:43.491
[Lola] Oh, they're cute.
What about them?

04:43.575 --> 04:46.536
I don't want to date another couple, Lo.
That was a one-time thing.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.455
Really? Because I heard
once you go "pack,"

04:48.538 --> 04:50.498
-you never go back.
-[locker thuds]

04:52.375 --> 04:54.210
Wow, that's awful.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.838
Mmm. People are still mad about
what he said at that assembly.

04:56.921 --> 04:59.215
-Why? What he said was smart.
-[sighs]

05:01.759 --> 05:04.429
Do you mind if I partner with him
for our electricity project?

05:04.512 --> 05:06.931
[chuckles] And there it is.

05:07.014 --> 05:09.517
-You like him. [chuckles]
-I just feel bad.

05:09.601 --> 05:10.893
And he's such a nice guy.

05:10.977 --> 05:14.146
-He doesn't deserve this at all.
-Classic, Lola.

05:14.230 --> 05:17.233
Back at it again with
those problematic crushes. [chuckles]

05:17.317 --> 05:19.026
What's that supposed to mean?

05:19.110 --> 05:20.612
Your best friend's crush.

05:20.695 --> 05:23.948
A rando who knocked you up.
You just make bad choices.

05:24.031 --> 05:26.826
You dated both Zig and Esme.

05:26.909 --> 05:28.786
I'm not the one who makes bad choices.

05:30.622 --> 05:31.956
Hey.

05:32.039 --> 05:34.667
Uh, do you maybe want to partner up
for our next science project?

05:34.751 --> 05:37.294
[stammers] Uh, yes.

05:38.129 --> 05:41.383
I'd like that. Um...
I'll see you in class?

05:45.845 --> 05:46.971
Be careful.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.476
-Hey.
-Hi.

05:52.059 --> 05:53.728
Why is everyone so worried
about me hanging out with him?

05:53.811 --> 05:57.064
-He doesn't strike you as angry?
-I've seen you get pretty angry.

05:57.148 --> 05:58.900
-Wait. What are you guys saying?
-[Hunter] Nothing.

05:58.983 --> 06:01.528
Nothing. It's just, you know,
nobody knows him.

06:01.611 --> 06:04.447
-And he says all that weird stuff.
-He's just a scared high school kid.

06:04.531 --> 06:07.700
So was one of the Brussels attackers
until the radicals got to him online.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.368
Okay, this is stupid.
You guys think he's a terrorist

06:09.452 --> 06:10.828
just because he's not from here?

06:10.912 --> 06:12.622
No, not at all.
Anyone can be radicalized.

06:12.705 --> 06:15.667
Vijay could be an extremist...
even with that silly hat.

06:15.750 --> 06:16.959
[Baaz] You can't judge a book
by its cover...

06:17.960 --> 06:20.630
But you'd get a pretty clear idea
from his browser history.

06:26.719 --> 06:28.638
[Jonah whispering] Okay,
but what if it doesn't work?

06:28.721 --> 06:30.432
-[Tiny] It'll work.
-What's the backup plan?

06:31.474 --> 06:32.684
[sighs]

06:33.267 --> 06:35.311
-I tested it myself.
-What if she says no?

06:35.394 --> 06:36.813
[both chuckle]

06:37.730 --> 06:41.400
-You're here early.
-I, uh... I needed to prep something.

06:41.484 --> 06:43.110
Oh, great!

06:43.194 --> 06:45.613
Um, that you're prepared, I mean.

06:45.697 --> 06:47.073
[Jonah] Hey.
[Grace] Hey.

06:52.995 --> 06:54.747
Come on, come on, come on.

06:57.208 --> 06:58.375
[students gasp]

07:08.010 --> 07:09.721
-[girl chuckles] Yes, Jonah!
-[boy 1] Oh!

07:09.804 --> 07:12.139
-[laughs]
-So, what do you say?

07:12.223 --> 07:15.142
[chuckling] I already bought
our tickets, dummy.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.645
-[boy 2] Whoo! Yeah, Jonah!
-[students applauding]

07:17.729 --> 07:19.481
[chuckling]

07:19.564 --> 07:22.316
Um, Shay... you okay?

07:22.399 --> 07:24.611
Oh, yeah,
I'm just really excited for them.

07:24.694 --> 07:25.695
[chuckles]

07:28.322 --> 07:29.949
[breathing heavily]

07:36.623 --> 07:37.624
[speaking French]

07:38.374 --> 07:39.584
What does that mean?

07:42.670 --> 07:44.255
[in English] "I am sorry."

07:44.338 --> 07:47.049
Just because my girlfriend left,
doesn't mean Miles will.

07:48.843 --> 07:49.927
J'accepte.

07:50.803 --> 07:54.516
Good, because I'm starving.
Let's hit the caf. It's pierogi night.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.851
Yeah, actually,
I'm just gonna finish this, and then, uh,

07:56.934 --> 07:59.186
I'm probably gonna eat in my room
while I study.

07:59.270 --> 08:00.688
Have a geo test.

08:01.689 --> 08:02.732
[treadmill beeping]

08:07.278 --> 08:10.072
You've been at it for 40 minutes.
Maybe you should slow down.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.407
I'm fine. Really.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.951
Four weeks until Europe.
I need to be ready.

08:14.035 --> 08:15.787
Good enough for a five?

08:15.870 --> 08:18.039
Is your coordination even there yet?

08:18.122 --> 08:19.331
Of course it is.

08:25.963 --> 08:27.464
Are you okay?

08:27.549 --> 08:29.050
Yeah, I just missed a step.

08:30.301 --> 08:31.969
[grunts]

08:32.053 --> 08:33.888
-Take it easy.
-[breathing heavily]

08:33.971 --> 08:36.683
Last time I went this hard,
I was stuck in bed for a week.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.352
I'm fine. Seriously.

08:42.689 --> 08:43.815
[treadmill beeps]

08:56.619 --> 08:59.956
So, that promposal you planned
for Jonah and Grace was pretty cool.

09:00.039 --> 09:01.833
Sure, if you're into that.

09:03.167 --> 09:05.587
-You're not?
-It's kind of ridiculous.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.463
I mean, it's just prom,
not a wedding proposal.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.090
Well, it's special for some people.

09:09.173 --> 09:12.426
The ones who've got something to prove,
[scoffs] but we don't need that.

09:12.509 --> 09:15.429
You don't think prom's a chance
to celebrate with friends?

09:15.512 --> 09:18.474
We can do that whenever,
without wasting hundreds of dollars.

09:20.059 --> 09:21.310
I guess you're right.

09:22.478 --> 09:25.314
I'm so happy that you're not one of
those girls who freaks out about prom.

09:25.397 --> 09:27.650
Yeah, we can do our own thing that night.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.444
Yeah, sure. You can... We can watch
a movie at my place, or whatever.

09:31.654 --> 09:32.947
Yeah, sure. Whatever works for you.

09:40.204 --> 09:41.538
[boy giggling]

09:41.623 --> 09:43.207
[sighs] I don't even know where to start.

09:43.290 --> 09:45.126
-[boy yells]
-[both chuckle]

09:46.377 --> 09:47.712
[Lola laughs]

09:47.795 --> 09:50.715
-What are you doing?
-Mustache! [laughs]

09:51.633 --> 09:53.467
Okay, let's get serious.

09:58.222 --> 10:00.892
Okay, uh, "Strip the wire
and connect it to the..."

10:02.143 --> 10:03.477
Oh. How do you know how to do that?

10:04.103 --> 10:08.107
Oh, I learned in Syria... from my cousin.

10:08.190 --> 10:11.443
Oh, for fun?
You didn't have, like, video games?

10:11.527 --> 10:12.987
-[boy shrieks]
-[clattering]

10:13.070 --> 10:16.532
Um, they play so rough. Excuse me.

10:19.118 --> 10:21.913
[Saad speaking Arabic]

10:22.997 --> 10:24.749
[Saad in English]
Calm down, calm down. Come on.

10:24.832 --> 10:26.793
Come on, join your sister.

10:30.379 --> 10:32.131
Now, don't make too much noise.

10:34.967 --> 10:36.969
-[gasps]
-What are you doing?

10:37.887 --> 10:40.431
Um, I was just about to order some pizza.

10:41.473 --> 10:43.100
You were searching my computer.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.311
I didn't find anything, I swear.

10:45.394 --> 10:48.856
-What were you hoping to find?
-[sighs]

10:48.940 --> 10:51.776
My... my friends made me believe
you were talking to someone bad.

10:51.859 --> 10:53.653
-And you believed them?
-No, I just...

10:53.736 --> 10:56.405
-You should go.
-[breathing shakily]

10:59.075 --> 11:01.911

[gasps]

11:40.324 --> 11:41.909
[groaning softly]

11:53.462 --> 11:55.422
[Miles] Tristan?

11:55.506 --> 11:58.801
-Still in bed? Our test is today.
-I, um... I just need to...

11:58.885 --> 12:00.845
Just wait in the hall.
I'll be right there.

12:00.928 --> 12:03.055
No, let me help.
Where are your pants?

12:03.139 --> 12:06.683
-Please, I'll just be one second.
-No. This is good practice for Europe.

12:07.769 --> 12:09.061
-Miles, just wait.
-Here.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.772
-Miles.
-[both breathing heavily]

12:11.981 --> 12:13.399
[Tristan urinating]

12:18.946 --> 12:20.364
Uh, Tris, I...

12:24.660 --> 12:26.745
I... Here, let me help.

12:26.829 --> 12:29.206
Just stop.
Just... I told you to wait in the hall.

12:32.543 --> 12:33.795
[sighs]

12:39.091 --> 12:41.760
[Oliver] Uh, I'll get you
another pair of boxers.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.513
[sighs]

12:50.269 --> 12:51.562
[Lola] What do these say to you?

12:52.479 --> 12:54.857
European night club?
I don't know. [chuckles]

12:55.942 --> 12:58.402
Not "I'm so sorry
I accused you of being a terrorist"?

12:58.485 --> 13:01.072
Don't tell me you listened to
those conspiracy theory morons.

13:08.579 --> 13:11.498
I saw you searched for these.
Please take 'em.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.210
I'm so sorry.

13:15.211 --> 13:17.839
-I know how hard it is to be different.
-You do?

13:17.922 --> 13:19.841
My family's from Argentina.

13:19.924 --> 13:22.343
I didn't learn English
until I was in kindergarten.

13:23.677 --> 13:25.512
Did they think you were
going to hurt them?

13:25.596 --> 13:28.349
No, but they thought I was, like,
some sort of explorer.

13:29.851 --> 13:31.185
Like Dora?

13:34.230 --> 13:38.901
Okay, anyway, um, not the same,
but what I did was unforgivable

13:38.985 --> 13:41.946
and if you never want to
speak to me again, I get it.

13:42.029 --> 13:43.865
[sighs] Wait.

13:46.868 --> 13:48.202
[sighs]

13:51.330 --> 13:53.332
I... I need your help.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.334
Anything.

13:55.417 --> 13:58.712
I was talking to someone online.

13:58.795 --> 14:01.048
I... I thought he was a friend, but...

14:01.132 --> 14:03.885
-He wasn't a...
-A radical? I think so.

14:05.094 --> 14:08.139
[stammers] Did he try to get you
to do something bad?

14:08.222 --> 14:13.060
He wanted me to come back to Syria,
offered to book me a flight...

14:13.144 --> 14:14.436
How could I be so stupid?

14:14.520 --> 14:16.313
-We have to tell someone.
-We can't!

14:16.397 --> 14:19.108
-What if he comes after me?
-The police will stop him.

14:19.191 --> 14:21.818
The police?
What if they think I was involved?

14:21.903 --> 14:24.030
-But you weren't, right?
-No!

14:24.113 --> 14:26.615
But I... I've been talking to him
for weeks.

14:26.698 --> 14:30.786
-There... there are conversations.
-Okay, uh, meet me after school.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.998
-We'll scrub all your socials and devices.
-You know how to do that?

14:35.416 --> 14:37.334
I think I know someone who does.

14:47.261 --> 14:49.096
[Tristan breathing heavily]

14:55.311 --> 14:56.312
Hey.

14:57.271 --> 15:00.441
-What cat dragged you in?
-Rough morning.

15:01.483 --> 15:04.695
But I'm here and I'm ready
to focus on the test.

15:16.290 --> 15:19.168
-Good luck.
-[Mr. Perino] Flip your papers.

15:25.382 --> 15:28.052
So? Did he do it yet?
Do you have pictures?

15:28.135 --> 15:30.012
Oh, please tell me
you get to keep the armadillo.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.638
I don't think we're going to prom.

15:32.806 --> 15:35.892
-It's just really expensive.
-But you were so excited.

15:36.477 --> 15:37.894
Well, I have to be fiscally responsible.

15:37.979 --> 15:40.481
[sighs] Look at you being all mature.

15:40.564 --> 15:44.776
-Sex really does change everything.
-It's not like that. We're good.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.612
[clears throat] No, you're not.

15:47.863 --> 15:50.366
-Excuse me?
-[sighs] It's simple economics.

15:50.449 --> 15:53.285
Tiny got the milk for free,
ergo he doesn't need to buy the cow.

15:53.369 --> 15:54.703
What are you even saying?

15:54.786 --> 15:56.913
-They had sex, right?
-Oh, my God.

15:56.998 --> 15:59.750
So why would Tiny do a big promposal
if he already got what he wants?

15:59.833 --> 16:01.585
It's not like that.
Seriously, we're just gonna...

16:01.668 --> 16:03.337
have a nice night in, just the two of us.

16:03.420 --> 16:04.838
Like, watching a movie?

16:05.631 --> 16:07.508
Yeah, but why are you saying it like that?

16:07.591 --> 16:09.301
"Watching a movie" is just code.

16:09.385 --> 16:11.387
He found a cheaper route
to doing it than prom.

16:11.470 --> 16:12.888
Simple economics.

16:35.119 --> 16:36.953
-[exhales]
-[Mr. Perino] Time's up.

16:45.212 --> 16:46.213
How'd it go?

16:47.964 --> 16:50.801
-[sighs]
-There's always next time.

16:53.929 --> 16:57.558
If I can't even pass a test,
how am I gonna go to Europe with Miles?

16:58.475 --> 16:59.726
[sighs] I don't know.

16:59.810 --> 17:02.604
Maybe you can postpone your trip
until you're ready.

17:02.688 --> 17:06.108
It's important to take care of yourself,
take the time you need...

17:06.192 --> 17:08.194
Wait, he peed on you?

17:08.277 --> 17:12.156
Was this before or after you told him
you got into the London Writer's Academy?

17:12.239 --> 17:13.365
I didn't tell him.

17:13.449 --> 17:17.744
I'm actually going to try to defer a year.
He obviously needs me right now.

17:17.828 --> 17:20.706
See? Miles is willing
to wait for you, too.

17:22.708 --> 17:27.088
So I will delete your socials
and wipe your hard drives, and poof!

17:27.171 --> 17:29.381
It'll be like you never existed.

17:29.465 --> 17:32.884
-Will this really work?
-Well, no one can see what isn't there.

17:32.968 --> 17:36.180
Okay, here's Saad's phone.
Here's all of his usernames and passwords.

17:36.972 --> 17:38.640
I'll go distract my brother.

17:39.558 --> 17:40.767
[sighs]

17:41.977 --> 17:43.979
Ah! [growling]

17:44.896 --> 17:46.773
-I'm coming to get you!
-[boy laughing]

17:46.857 --> 17:51.027
Okay, this is crazy.
Can't he just call the authorities?

17:51.112 --> 17:54.240
He can't, I told you.
We have to help him, don't we?

17:55.116 --> 17:57.326
I thought so, but look at this.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.705
"The kids at my school are stupid.

18:01.788 --> 18:03.957
No one would miss them
if someone just wiped them out."

18:04.040 --> 18:05.667
We all say things we don't mean.

18:07.461 --> 18:11.882
You've never felt alone? Isolated?
No one understands you?

18:13.175 --> 18:16.262
[Saad] Help!
These tickle monsters have me pinned.

18:19.265 --> 18:24.770
Fine, I... I'll do it. Just go,
before the tickle monsters devour him.

18:26.855 --> 18:28.774
[Lola sighs] Here comes super-Lola!

18:28.857 --> 18:30.484
[all laughing]

18:37.324 --> 18:38.909
[camera shutter clicks]

18:40.035 --> 18:41.662
[pop song playing over speakers]

18:44.206 --> 18:45.332
Little bit. Yeah.

18:45.416 --> 18:47.501
Just because we slept together,
doesn't mean you can stop trying.

18:47.584 --> 18:48.752
What are you talking about?

18:48.835 --> 18:50.712
You do this whole special thing
for Grace and Jonah,

18:50.796 --> 18:52.881
but now that we've done it,
you can't go out of your way for me?

18:52.964 --> 18:55.759
-Okay, listen--
-No! I'm not, like, some cow, okay?

18:55.842 --> 18:57.219
And my milk is definitely not free!

18:58.011 --> 18:59.471
[music playing louder]

18:59.555 --> 19:01.182
Hey, I'm trying to have
a conversation here!

19:02.474 --> 19:04.685
Give me a second.
I gotta do a thing.

19:42.556 --> 19:45.058
Shay, will you go to prom with me?

19:46.893 --> 19:49.605
-Yeah! [chuckles]
-[students cheering]

20:03.118 --> 20:05.787
[Lola] And then we add salt to the water
to complete the connection.

20:06.913 --> 20:09.375
And once we complete the circuit...

20:10.334 --> 20:11.585
[girl] Whoa.

20:15.631 --> 20:17.090
[students applauding]

20:18.967 --> 20:20.302
-Yes!
-[bell ringing]

20:20.386 --> 20:22.304
-[Saad] Uh...
-Okay. [laughs]

20:22.388 --> 20:24.180
[Saad chuckles awkwardly]

20:24.265 --> 20:27.268
Maybe I had him all wrong.
Did I just see sparks?

20:27.351 --> 20:32.147
Well, that was the point. Oh, you mean...
Okay, maybe. [laughs]

20:38.987 --> 20:41.448
So... how are you doing?

20:42.616 --> 20:46.328
I feel less worried. Um, it's weird
not having social media, though.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.414
That's okay. I'll be your friend.

20:48.497 --> 20:52.751
-[chuckles] How can I ever repay you?
-Yael and I are volunteering at prom.

20:52.834 --> 20:55.254
Come keep me company,
I'll consider us even.

20:57.088 --> 20:59.215
A magical night with a wonderful girl?

20:59.300 --> 21:01.510
-You drive a hard bargain.
-[both chuckle]

21:03.554 --> 21:06.432
[exhales] Put that there.

21:07.766 --> 21:10.352
[woman speaking French on laptop]

21:20.737 --> 21:22.864
Can we talk about this morning?

21:26.660 --> 21:29.330
You can't give up
the London Writer's Academy for me.

21:32.833 --> 21:38.046
Well, it can wait.
Right now, I want to be here for you.

21:38.129 --> 21:40.341
You're putting off all your dreams.

21:43.635 --> 21:48.515
And... I think that we need to break up.

21:50.684 --> 21:54.771
-No.
-All I've ever done is push myself...

21:55.856 --> 21:57.273
for you...

21:59.067 --> 22:00.736
and it's been killing me.

22:01.403 --> 22:02.779
So this is my fault?

22:03.739 --> 22:06.575
I stood by your side
while you were in a coma.

22:06.658 --> 22:08.369
I was here during
all of your rehab sessions.

22:08.452 --> 22:12.122
-I gave up everything.
-I didn't ask you to do that.

22:12.205 --> 22:14.082
After everything that we've been through,

22:14.165 --> 22:16.167
-are you seriously suggesting that--
-No, I just...

22:17.168 --> 22:18.379
I don't know.

22:19.630 --> 22:21.632
I just can't do this anymore.

22:25.844 --> 22:28.847
So I don't even get a say
when it comes to my own relationship?

22:29.598 --> 22:32.100
Not when it gets in the way of my health.

22:34.811 --> 22:37.731
If I'm ever gonna get better,
I have to do it on my own.

22:59.878 --> 23:01.880
[melancholy song playing]
