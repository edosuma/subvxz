00:33.838 --> 00:38.740
Never thought that
l'd be fighting you

00:38.942 --> 00:43.106
But you stole my heart
you cheated and lied

00:44.281 --> 00:49.618
you Weren't in my corner
you Weren't on my side

00:49.920 --> 00:52.219
The gloves are off
you hit below the belt

00:55.192 --> 01:00.859
Now it's time-out, baby
And they've rung the bell

01:01.265 --> 01:03.664
l'm not a fighter
l'm a lover

01:03.868 --> 01:06.665
But if you run
Then run for cover

01:06.870 --> 01:09.840
Fight for your love
yeah

01:17.614 --> 01:21.881
- When it's round two, girl
- Turn this up! Now!

01:22.085 --> 01:24.076
- Good.
- l get a knockout punch

01:24.287 --> 01:27.257
With this heartfelt song

01:28.426 --> 01:31.953
l know when l count you
Down from ten

01:33.798 --> 01:38.167
l'll find you
ln my loving arms again

01:39.170 --> 01:44.004
The gloves are off
you hit below the belt

01:44.207 --> 01:49.338
Now it's time-out, baby
And they've rung the bell

01:50.548 --> 01:52.846
l'm not a fighter
l'm a lover

01:53.049 --> 01:55.712
But if you run
Then run for cover

01:55.920 --> 01:59.650
Fight for your love
yeah

02:23.948 --> 02:25.609
l'm not a fighter
l'm a lover

02:25.817 --> 02:28.546
But if you run
Then run for cover

02:28.752 --> 02:31.847
Fight for your love
yeah

02:43.266 --> 02:46.168
Whoa, nobody caught me.
That was lame.

02:46.370 --> 02:48.429
l don't think he's moving.

02:58.415 --> 03:00.145
He is a lazy freeloader,

03:00.350 --> 03:02.979
and it's time for all this
dysfunction to stop.

03:03.187 --> 03:05.382
Can't We just do this later?

03:05.590 --> 03:08.150
l mean, you know how
he gets in the morning.

03:08.359 --> 03:12.489
Ned, aren't you tired of letting people
push you around?

03:12.697 --> 03:14.425
Yes.

03:15.098 --> 03:17.829
Then get in there and do it.

03:21.271 --> 03:22.739
What?

03:22.939 --> 03:24.168
What is it?

03:24.375 --> 03:28.538
Dewey, hey,
it's the first of the month, and...

03:28.746 --> 03:30.907
...l'd like your share
of the rent now.

03:31.115 --> 03:32.843
Man, you know l don't have it.

03:33.050 --> 03:35.644
You wake me up for that?
Come on, man!

03:35.853 --> 03:37.912
Sorry.

03:41.324 --> 03:44.384
Dewey, l mean, you owe me
a lot of money as it is.

03:44.594 --> 03:46.324
Yeah, try $2,200.

03:46.530 --> 03:51.661
Ok, you guys,
the band is about to hit it bigtime.

03:51.868 --> 03:55.326
We'll win Battle of the Bands.
When l'm rolling in Benjamins,

03:55.538 --> 03:58.302
l Will throw you and your dog a bone.
Good night.

03:58.508 --> 04:02.240
- Your band has never made 2 cents.
- Patty, come on, l'm on this.

04:02.445 --> 04:04.538
Oh, you're on this?
You're on this?

04:04.748 --> 04:06.272
He's Walking all over you.

04:06.484 --> 04:09.008
Mommy, could we please
talk about this later?

04:09.219 --> 04:12.848
No, We can't talk about it later,
because we have to go to work.

04:13.056 --> 04:16.355
We have jobs.
We contribute to society. All right?

04:16.560 --> 04:19.757
l am an assistant to
the mayor of the city, ''hello''!

04:19.963 --> 04:23.524
What? Can you get her out of here,
please? Why? Why her?

04:23.733 --> 04:26.430
And Ned has the most
important job there is.

04:27.170 --> 04:28.399
Temping?

04:28.605 --> 04:31.005
Dewey, a substitute teacher
is not a temp.

04:31.208 --> 04:33.574
- He's a babysitter.
- Think it's so easy?

04:33.778 --> 04:36.541
l'd like to see you try.
You Wouldn't last a day.

04:36.747 --> 04:38.805
Dude, l service society
by rocking.

04:39.016 --> 04:41.610
l'm out there liberating people
With my music.

04:41.819 --> 04:44.343
Rocking ain't no
Walk in the park, lady.

04:44.555 --> 04:46.648
All right, this is useless,
all right?

04:46.857 --> 04:50.759
Tell him if he doesn't come up
With the rent by the end of the Week,

04:50.961 --> 04:52.189
he's out of here.

04:52.396 --> 04:55.456
Dewey, l'm not paying
your share of the rent, so...

04:55.665 --> 04:58.964
...maybe you should sell
one of your guitars or something.

04:59.170 --> 05:00.569
What?

05:00.771 --> 05:03.399
Would you tell Picasso
to sell his guitars?

05:04.875 --> 05:07.742
Oh, my God. He's an idiot.

05:08.812 --> 05:12.249
Dude, l've been mooching off you
for years,

05:12.449 --> 05:15.680
and it was never a problem until
she showed up. Dump her.

05:15.886 --> 05:18.855
lf you don't come up with
some money, she'll dump me.

05:19.055 --> 05:21.649
Really? That would be good.
She's a nightmare.

05:21.858 --> 05:24.418
Come on. l may never have
another girlfriend.

05:24.627 --> 05:27.755
l mean, just come on.
Come up with some money, please.

05:27.964 --> 05:29.192
Please.

05:29.399 --> 05:32.528
Ok. For you. Not for her, man.
For you.

05:33.471 --> 05:34.733
Thank you.

05:35.038 --> 05:36.802
Heal me

05:37.007 --> 05:39.033
l'm heartsick
D minor.

05:39.242 --> 05:44.408
l'm hungry
And A minor, G, on you

05:44.615 --> 05:46.742
- Heal my heart
- Hey! What's up?

05:46.951 --> 05:49.180
ls that a new song?
Who's this guy?

05:49.387 --> 05:52.617
We're taking the Battle of the Bands
seriously this year.

05:52.822 --> 05:55.451
Good, because l need
the money. Now, listen.

05:55.658 --> 05:59.992
lf We're gonna win this thing, We gotta
actually start playing some music.

06:00.197 --> 06:01.788
l agree. You're fired.

06:01.999 --> 06:05.627
Your lyrics, now don't take this
the wrong way, Theo, are lame.

06:05.836 --> 06:09.396
But l've been sitting on some
awesome material, so...

06:09.607 --> 06:11.403
Did you hear What l said?

06:11.608 --> 06:12.906
We voted.

06:13.110 --> 06:14.668
You're out.

06:14.879 --> 06:17.108
This is Spider. He's replacing you.

06:17.314 --> 06:19.076
What's up, dog?

06:21.317 --> 06:24.583
l was gonna tell you last night,
but you passed out, man.

06:24.788 --> 06:28.156
You're gonna kick me out of the band?
You're gonna fire me?

06:28.358 --> 06:31.817
- lt's my band. l brought us together.
- Theo wanted you out.

06:32.028 --> 06:36.398
- There's nothing l could do.
- Shut up, man. You voted him out too.

06:36.600 --> 06:38.295
Dewey, listen to me.

06:38.701 --> 06:40.293
You're a good guitar player,

06:40.504 --> 06:45.531
but it's the 20-minute solos.
lt's the stage dives.

06:45.742 --> 06:50.202
We're trying to land a record deal here,
man, and you're an embarrassment.

06:50.680 --> 06:52.672
Read between the lines, Theo.

06:52.882 --> 06:55.283
Read between the lines!

06:55.485 --> 06:58.283
Dewey, man, l hope
this doesn't come between us.

06:58.488 --> 07:00.286
Like, l care about you, man.

07:00.490 --> 07:03.687
You guys, you know what?
You're nuts. You're all nuts.

07:03.894 --> 07:06.192
You've been focused
so hard on making it,

07:06.396 --> 07:09.331
you forgot about one thing.
lt's called the music.

07:09.533 --> 07:12.127
And l don't even care.
You know what? So what.

07:12.336 --> 07:15.430
l don't wanna hang out with
wannabe corporate sellouts.

07:15.639 --> 07:19.005
l'm gonna form my own band.
We're gonna start a revolution.

07:19.209 --> 07:23.475
And you're gonna be a funny
little footnote on my epic ass.

07:32.456 --> 07:34.788
l feel sorry for you guys.

07:40.697 --> 07:42.062
Yes.

07:42.266 --> 07:47.168
Yeah, it's a 1968 Gibson SG,
mint condish.

07:48.605 --> 07:49.834
No.

07:50.040 --> 07:52.634
That's all?
Well, that's a mistake.

07:52.843 --> 07:55.504
No, Hendrix played this guitar.

07:55.713 --> 07:57.475
Hello?

08:06.589 --> 08:08.420
- Yeah?
- ls this Mr. Schneebly?

08:08.625 --> 08:09.923
No, he's not here.

08:10.127 --> 08:13.824
- Could you take a message for me?
- Yeah.

08:14.031 --> 08:16.089
Hi. My name's Rosalie Mullins.

08:16.300 --> 08:20.430
l'm the principal at Horace Green Prep.
We're having a little emergency.

08:20.637 --> 08:23.697
One of our teachers broke
her leg this morning,

08:23.908 --> 08:26.172
and all of our subs
are already working.

08:26.377 --> 08:30.473
Pat Wickam at Milton Prep
recommended l call Mr. Schneebly.

08:30.680 --> 08:32.443
Do you know if he's available?

08:33.817 --> 08:36.751
- How long is the gig?
- Excuse me?

08:36.953 --> 08:39.081
How long is the job?

08:39.289 --> 08:41.019
As much as a few weeks,

08:41.225 --> 08:43.557
but we need somebody
to start immediately.

08:44.360 --> 08:46.453
So how much are we talking here?

08:47.498 --> 08:50.227
We pay our substitutes
650 a Week.

08:50.433 --> 08:53.596
Now, do you know when
Mr. Schneebly will be back?

08:53.803 --> 08:56.033
Hold on a sec.
Oh, you know what?

08:56.240 --> 09:00.437
l think he's just coming in right...
Ned, phone!

09:06.984 --> 09:09.451
Hello, this is Ned Schneebly.

09:20.697 --> 09:24.134
Pat faxed me your rèsumè.
lt's very impressive.

09:24.335 --> 09:28.066
We've never been in a bind like this
before, so thank you so much.

09:28.272 --> 09:31.605
So how's this gonna work?
Are you gonna pay me upfront?

09:31.808 --> 09:33.139
l don't understand.

09:33.344 --> 09:36.107
lt'd be really great
if l could get paid in cash.

09:36.312 --> 09:38.371
Oh, Well, We don't do that.

09:38.581 --> 09:42.575
When you cut my check, make it
payable to Dewey Finn, for tax reasons.

09:42.785 --> 09:46.414
You can discuss all of that
with Candace at the end of the day.

09:46.624 --> 09:48.091
When's the end of the day?

09:48.292 --> 09:51.317
We commence at 8:15,
school lets out at 3.

09:52.629 --> 09:54.028
You know what?

09:54.230 --> 09:58.759
Do you think l could cut out a little
early today? l got some stuff l gotta do.

10:00.638 --> 10:02.434
lt's cool. l can stay.

10:03.573 --> 10:05.438
Mr. Schneebly...

10:05.643 --> 10:09.169
...this is considered the best
elementary school in the state,

10:09.379 --> 10:12.837
and We maintain that by adhering
to a strict code of conduct,

10:13.049 --> 10:14.517
faculty included.

10:14.717 --> 10:17.015
Don't worry about me.
l'm a hard-ass.

10:17.221 --> 10:20.519
lf a kid gets out of line, l got
no problem smacking him.

10:21.658 --> 10:24.355
No, no. We don't use
corporal punishment here.

10:24.561 --> 10:26.995
Ok, so just verbal abuse?

10:28.264 --> 10:31.701
lf you have any problems with
any students, send them to me.

10:31.902 --> 10:34.096
- l will do the disciplining.
- Check.

10:39.009 --> 10:40.976
Children.

10:41.979 --> 10:44.504
Please take your seats.

10:45.682 --> 10:48.480
l'd like to introduce
Miss Dunham's substitute.

10:48.686 --> 10:50.950
This is Mr. Schneebly.

10:52.423 --> 10:55.051
Why don't you write
your name on the board.

10:55.525 --> 10:57.356
Yes, l will.

11:06.169 --> 11:10.197
You know what?
Why don't you all just call me ''Mr. S''.

11:12.241 --> 11:15.404
Mr. S has never taught here
at Horace Green,

11:15.611 --> 11:18.774
so l Want you all to be
on your best behavior.

11:19.383 --> 11:21.749
So the curriculum
is on the desk.

11:21.951 --> 11:25.388
- And do you have any questions?
- Yeah, When's lunch?

11:27.256 --> 11:29.451
The children just had their lunch.

11:29.659 --> 11:31.855
ls there anything else you need?

11:33.596 --> 11:37.363
l'm a teacher.
All l need are minds for molding.

11:37.567 --> 11:40.969
All right, then. Well, thanks again.
You saved the day.

11:49.078 --> 11:52.014
Ok, Who's got food in here?

11:54.217 --> 11:56.947
You're not gonna get in trouble.
l'm hungry.

12:00.823 --> 12:03.258
You. What do you got?

12:08.331 --> 12:10.265
That's What l'm talking about.

12:14.270 --> 12:18.139
Ok. Teach. Teach. Teach.

12:18.341 --> 12:21.470
All right, look, here's the deal.

12:21.677 --> 12:25.135
l've got a hangover.
Who knoWs What that means?

12:25.349 --> 12:30.081
- Doesn't that mean you're drunk?
- No. lt means l Was drunk yesterday.

12:30.287 --> 12:33.687
- lt means you're an alcoholic.
- Wrong.

12:33.890 --> 12:36.826
You Wouldn't come to Work
hung-over unless you Were.

12:37.027 --> 12:39.427
Dude, you got a disease.

12:40.596 --> 12:42.860
- What's your name?
- Freddy Jones.

12:43.066 --> 12:44.828
Freddy Jones, shut up.

12:45.836 --> 12:47.496
Shut up.

12:48.038 --> 12:50.562
The point is,
you all can just chill today.

12:50.774 --> 12:54.471
We'll start on
this crapola tomorroW.

12:55.178 --> 12:58.148
- Yes, Tinkerbell?
- Summer.

12:58.347 --> 13:02.546
As class factotum, first l'd like to
just say, Welcome to Horace Green.

13:02.753 --> 13:05.448
- Thank you.
- Any questions about our schedule?

13:05.655 --> 13:08.523
Because usually noW
Miss Dunham teaches vocabulary,

13:08.725 --> 13:12.354
then gives us a pop quiz, then
splits us up into reading groups.

13:12.562 --> 13:14.724
- Track B is...
- Ok, hey, hey, hey.

13:15.365 --> 13:18.265
Miss ''Dumbum''
ain't your teacher today, l am.

13:18.469 --> 13:20.437
And l got a headache
and the runs.

13:20.636 --> 13:22.696
So l say, time for recess.

13:22.905 --> 13:26.865
But Mr. S, that poster charts
everyone's performance.

13:27.076 --> 13:29.909
We get stars When We master
the material covered.

13:30.113 --> 13:32.876
HoW do We get gold stars
if We just have recess?

13:33.317 --> 13:36.844
- What are these black dots here?
- Demerits.

13:40.691 --> 13:43.682
What kind of a sick school is this?

13:54.804 --> 14:00.606
As long as l'm here, there Will be
no grades or gold stars or demerits.

14:00.811 --> 14:03.041
We're gonna have recess
all the time.

14:03.246 --> 14:06.273
But Miss Dunham only gives us
recess for 1 5 minutes...

14:06.482 --> 14:10.681
You're not hearing me, girl.

so just go With it.

15:54.390 --> 15:56.120
No, thanks.

15:57.094 --> 15:58.686
You're not a teacher, Ned.

15:58.894 --> 16:01.591
You're the cross-dressing,
blood-sucking incubus

16:01.798 --> 16:04.096
from Maggot Death.
That's the real you.

16:04.301 --> 16:06.860
DeWey, l'm not a satanic
sex god anymore.

16:07.070 --> 16:09.903

But Who are you, babe?

16:15.711 --> 16:17.441
This is my apartment, babe.

16:17.648 --> 16:20.639
Not if you don't pay your rent,
it's not. Get a job.

16:20.850 --> 16:24.878

of the Week. Go tell the mayor.

16:25.087 --> 16:28.524

Come on, man!

16:36.600 --> 16:40.535
We split it 60/40. Grab your bass
and come back to the garage.

16:40.736 --> 16:43.068
l mean, don't you miss rocking out?

16:43.273 --> 16:46.538
lf you think anyone is gonna
be in a band With you,

16:46.777 --> 16:48.870
you're more delusional
than l thought.

16:49.078 --> 16:53.481
DeWey, you knoW, maybe it's time
to give up those dreams.

16:53.683 --> 16:57.881
l did, and things are going
really great for me.

17:15.105 --> 17:18.768
Are you gonna teach us anything
or are We just gonna sit here?

17:20.343 --> 17:22.242
Just do Whatever you Want.

17:24.346 --> 17:27.781
- l Want to learn from my teacher.
- Besides that.

17:28.585 --> 17:30.916
Freddy, What do you
like to do?

17:31.121 --> 17:34.021
l don't knoW, burn stuff?

17:34.223 --> 17:37.317
Just go out and have recess.

17:37.527 --> 17:42.726
My parents don't spend $1 5,000
a year for recess.

17:44.534 --> 17:46.968
- You Want to learn something?
- Yes, l do.

17:47.170 --> 17:49.137
You Want me to teach
you something?

17:49.338 --> 17:51.671
All right, here's a useful lesson
for you.

17:51.875 --> 17:54.537
Give up. Just quit.

17:54.744 --> 17:58.077
Because in this life, you can't Win.

17:58.280 --> 18:02.376
Yeah, you can try, but in the end,
you're just gonna lose, bigtime,

18:02.586 --> 18:04.780
because the World is run
by The Man.

18:04.988 --> 18:06.386
- Who?
- The Man.

18:06.589 --> 18:08.182
Oh, you don't knoW The Man?

18:08.391 --> 18:09.756
Well, he's everywhere.

18:09.960 --> 18:13.726
ln the White House, doWn the hall.
Miss Mullins, she's The Man.

18:13.930 --> 18:18.195
And The Man ruined the ozone,
and he's burning doWn the Amazon,

18:18.401 --> 18:21.528
and he kidnapped Shamu
and put her in a chlorine tank.

18:21.738 --> 18:26.038
There used to be a Way to stick it
to The Man. lt Was called rock 'n' roll.

18:26.242 --> 18:28.006
But guess What. Oh, no.

18:28.211 --> 18:31.544
The Man ruined that too
With a little thing called MTV!

18:32.414 --> 18:33.814
So don't Waste your time

18:34.017 --> 18:36.712
trying to make anything cool
or pure or aWesome.

18:36.920 --> 18:41.084
The Man's just gonna call you a fat,
Washed-up loser and crush your soul.

18:41.290 --> 18:44.384
So do yourselves a favor
and just give up!

18:49.365 --> 18:51.459
Mr. Schneebly, it's after 1 0.

18:51.667 --> 18:55.068

Cello.

23:04.788 --> 23:07.313
This is a bass guitar.
lt's exactly the same,

23:07.523 --> 23:12.461
but instead of playing like this, you tip it
on the side, ''chello'', you've got a bass.

23:12.662 --> 23:14.128
Try it on.

23:14.864 --> 23:18.299
Ok, noW play this note

keep that G coming all day long.

23:23.873 --> 23:25.170
G, G, G, G, G, G

23:25.375 --> 23:28.833
Good. Stop. Are there any drummers

No middle one, l changed my mind.

24:09.853 --> 24:11.286
NoW go an octave beloW.

24:11.488 --> 24:13.512
NoW give me some rhythm.

Play it up here on the cymbal,
but really light.

24:34.644 --> 24:37.407
Oh, that's it!
Ok, keep going With that.

24:37.614 --> 24:40.980
You remember this thing

25:05.875 --> 25:08.207

Of course l believe in grades.

25:12.781 --> 25:15.546
Good Work, Summer.
Four-and-a-half stars for you.

25:15.751 --> 25:20.086
NoW, listen, normal kids
Would have been stoked to slack off,

25:20.289 --> 25:23.691
but not you guys, because you're
not normal. You're special.

25:23.893 --> 25:26.156
Because you guys have
the right attitude,

25:26.362 --> 25:29.455
l think it's time We started
our neW class project.

25:29.665 --> 25:31.155
- A science project?
- No.

25:31.366 --> 25:35.133
lt's called...''Rock Band''.

25:35.672 --> 25:38.105
- ls this a school project?
- Yes.

25:38.307 --> 25:39.605
And it's a requirement.

25:39.808 --> 25:42.778
lt may sound easy,
but nothing could be harder.

25:42.979 --> 25:48.383
lt Will test your head and your mind
and your brain too.

25:48.585 --> 25:51.144
Will other schools be competing?

25:51.354 --> 25:53.253
You could say that.

25:53.455 --> 25:55.923
You could say that every school
in the state

25:56.125 --> 25:58.319
Will be competing for the top prize.

25:58.528 --> 25:59.994
What's the prize?

26:00.195 --> 26:05.462
A Win Will go on your permanent
record. Hello, Harvard, yo.

26:06.368 --> 26:09.361
We're not supposed

26:09.571 --> 26:13.269

on the competition, don't you?

26:13.476 --> 26:14.738

26:14.943 --> 26:17.810
- Who else Wants to go for the gold?
- l do.

26:18.013 --> 26:21.575
All right. But if anyone finds out,
We'll be disqualified.

26:21.784 --> 26:24.776
So let's just keep it

26:24.988 --> 26:27.479
- Can We tell our parents?
- No! Trust me.

26:27.690 --> 26:29.920
They don't Want to knoW.

26:33.863 --> 26:36.229

26:39.535 --> 26:42.698
You mean We're not in the band?

26:44.007 --> 26:45.736
NoW, hold up noW.

26:45.942 --> 26:50.208
Just because you're not in the band
doesn't mean you're not in the band.

26:50.413 --> 26:52.778
We need backup singers.
Who can sing?

26:54.916 --> 26:56.179
You, sing.

26:56.385 --> 26:59.513

28:15.798 --> 28:19.233

People in bands are cool. l'm not cool.

28:19.434 --> 28:24.098
Dude, you are cool. The Way you play.
Why do you say you're not cool?

28:25.407 --> 28:27.398
Nobody ever talks to me.

28:28.111 --> 28:29.976
Well, those days are over, buddy.

28:30.179 --> 28:32.875
You could be the ugliest sad sack

but if you're in a rocking band,
you're the cat's pajamas.

28:36.652 --> 28:39.415

30:05.173 --> 30:07.038
The band's future depends on you.

30:07.242 --> 30:11.076
Ok, your first mission:
soundproofing this room.

30:11.279 --> 30:13.042
Get on it.

30:13.249 --> 30:15.410
Can l be the band stylist instead?

30:15.617 --> 30:17.414
Of course you can, Fancy Pants.

30:17.619 --> 30:21.385
Ok. Carrot Top, Roadrunner,
Turkey Sub,

30:21.590 --> 30:23.582
We're gonna have
a lot of equipment.

30:23.792 --> 30:26.090
We're talking amps, electric guitars,

30:26.295 --> 30:29.127
maybe even lasers
and smoke machines.

30:29.332 --> 30:31.925
NoW, your job is to master
the transportation

30:32.134 --> 30:34.328
and operation of this technology.

30:34.537 --> 30:38.496
Without a first-rate roadie creW,
We'll never have a psychedelic shoW,

30:38.708 --> 30:43.441
and l can't live With that, Ok?
l'm counting on you. Get going. Go.

30:43.645 --> 30:45.579
All right.

30:45.780 --> 30:47.771
You three...

30:49.317 --> 30:51.808
...groupies.
And your job is simple.

30:52.255 --> 30:53.688
Just Worship the band.

30:53.890 --> 30:57.347
You're gonna be making hats,
you're gonna be making T-shirts,

30:57.559 --> 31:01.290
all kinds of merchandise, Which
leads me to your first assignment:

31:01.497 --> 31:03.795
- Naming the band.
- Yes.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.468

and shredding guitar.

31:12.942 --> 31:15.933
Wait. lsn't this a student project?

31:16.679 --> 31:19.978
- What's your point?
- Are you supposed to be in the band?

31:21.083 --> 31:24.314
What, you Want to get rid of me?
Why, because l'm old?

31:24.519 --> 31:27.421
You hate teachers,
is that What you're about?

31:27.623 --> 31:29.647
Ok, Well, teachers like to play too.

31:29.858 --> 31:32.794

31:51.113 --> 31:54.445
- ...for creative control.
- ...for creative control.

31:54.650 --> 31:56.709
And Will defer to him
on all issues

31:56.919 --> 31:59.443
related to the musical direction
of the band.

31:59.888 --> 32:03.256
- And Will defer to him...
- Direction...

32:06.561 --> 32:08.791
Let's get rocking!

32:24.680 --> 32:27.375
- Morning, Summer.
- Groupie?

32:27.583 --> 32:30.746
- What's the matter?
- You Want me to be a groupie?

32:30.952 --> 32:35.013
- Groupie is an important job.
- l researched groupies on the lnternet.

32:35.223 --> 32:37.453
They're sluts. They sleep
With the band.

32:37.660 --> 32:40.560
No. That's not true.
They're like cheerleaders.

32:40.762 --> 32:44.596
l don't Want to be a cheerleader.
Look, my mother is a room parent,

32:44.799 --> 32:48.098
and she's not gonna be happy
When she hears about this.

32:48.304 --> 32:51.671
Ok, l didn't Want to say this
in front of the other kids,

32:51.874 --> 32:54.365
but l made a special
position just for you.

32:54.576 --> 32:56.510
lt's the most important job
of all.

32:56.979 --> 32:58.207
Band manager.

32:58.847 --> 33:00.712
- Band manager?
- Oh, yeah.

33:00.915 --> 33:02.144
What's that?

33:02.351 --> 33:05.047

so it's up to you

33:05.253 --> 33:07.518
to make sure everyone
is doing their job.

of everything.

33:11.626 --> 33:13.992

- Ok.

33:15.431 --> 33:19.162
All right, look alive. Listen up.

33:19.367 --> 33:21.893
First thing you do
When you start a band...

33:22.104 --> 33:26.369
Mr. Schneebly, before We start,
shouldn't l first take attendance?

33:27.209 --> 33:28.971

- Let's see. Tomika?
- We're all here.

33:45.827 --> 33:51.892
The first thing you do When you start
a band is talk about your influences.

33:52.101 --> 33:56.162
That's hoW you figure out What kind
of band to be. So Who do you like?

33:56.905 --> 33:59.271

34:26.635 --> 34:28.864

34:35.643 --> 34:37.202

34:37.413 --> 34:40.007

34:41.250 --> 34:44.686
Summer, you're the class Whatever,

- What about math?
- No. Not important.

35:04.405 --> 35:06.306
- World cultures?

35:06.509 --> 35:09.443
We need to focus.
Don't you Wanna Win this contest?

35:09.644 --> 35:11.135
lt's prestigious.

35:12.248 --> 35:13.737
Question:

35:13.949 --> 35:15.974
HoW are We being graded
in all this?

35:16.452 --> 35:20.581
Since l'm band manager, and l have
the most responsibility, Wouldn't...?

35:20.789 --> 35:25.351
Summer, if you grade-grub, l Will send
you back to the first grade. You got it?

35:25.561 --> 35:29.224
- Back to your seat noW.
- Fine.

35:29.431 --> 35:33.197
- What are We gonna play?
- You don't have to Worry about that.

35:33.402 --> 35:36.132
We have aWesome material,
Which l Wrote.

35:36.438 --> 35:38.030
Let's hear it.

35:39.108 --> 35:42.077
- What?

35:42.478 --> 35:44.275
You Wanna hear my song?

35:44.612 --> 35:46.637
l'll play you my song,
if you Want.

35:47.416 --> 35:50.213
The thing is,
l just Want you to keep in mind,

35:50.418 --> 35:52.545
l Wrote it in, like, 1 5 minutes.

35:53.088 --> 35:57.320
- lt's not done. You might not like...
- Just play the song, Schneebly.

35:57.525 --> 36:01.791
Ok, l Will sing it for you,
but let me just get in the zone.

36:01.996 --> 36:04.396
l Was not planning on unveiling it,

36:04.934 --> 36:07.266
but l Will sing it.

36:08.670 --> 36:11.798
Tip of the tongue,
teeth and the lips.

36:16.177 --> 36:17.405
Ok.

36:17.612 --> 36:19.012
lt starts off...

36:19.215 --> 36:21.206
...a dark stage,

36:21.416 --> 36:23.077
and then a beam of light,

36:23.284 --> 36:26.344
and you can see me
and my guitar.

36:30.425 --> 36:32.985
ln the end of time

36:33.195 --> 36:36.460
There Was a man
Who kneW the road

36:36.664 --> 36:41.625
And the Writing
Was Written on the stone

36:41.836 --> 36:44.965
And then a thin layer of fog
comes in around my ankles.

36:45.173 --> 36:48.735
Roadies, that means dry ice.
We're gonna talk about this later.

36:48.943 --> 36:51.639
ln the ancient time

36:51.847 --> 36:54.315
An artist led the Way

36:54.516 --> 37:00.045
But no one
Seemed to understand

37:00.255 --> 37:02.052
Chimes, Freddy.

37:02.257 --> 37:05.021
ln his heart he kneW

37:05.226 --> 37:08.219
The artist must be true

37:08.429 --> 37:13.197
But the legend of the rent
Was Way past due

37:13.402 --> 37:16.496
And then, katie, you come in
With the bass.

37:20.842 --> 37:25.974
Well, you think you'll be just fine
Without me, but you're mine

37:26.181 --> 37:29.014
y ou think you can
Kick me out of the band

37:29.217 --> 37:32.585
And then, Zack, you come in
With a face-melter.

37:34.856 --> 37:38.588
Ok?
Well, there's just one problem there

37:38.793 --> 37:41.159
The band is mine

37:41.362 --> 37:46.197
HoW can you kick me out
Of What is mine?

37:46.402 --> 37:47.630
And then...

37:47.835 --> 37:50.304
HaWaii Five-O.
You ever see that shoW?

37:50.505 --> 37:53.407
Ok, Well,
there's a drum solo in it that goes:

37:53.876 --> 37:55.900
y ou're not hardcore

37:56.110 --> 37:57.907
Unless you live hardcore

37:58.112 --> 38:00.376
And l Want the backup singers
to be like:

38:00.581 --> 38:03.380
Well, you're not hardcore
No, you're not hardcore

38:03.585 --> 38:06.418
Unless you live hardc--
Unless you live hardcore

38:06.621 --> 38:10.990
But the legend of the rent
Was Way hardcore

38:11.193 --> 38:13.753
Boom! Big old explosion.

38:13.963 --> 38:16.454
Some, like, confetti comes doWn.

38:16.664 --> 38:19.532
That's all l got so far.
lt's a Work in progress.

38:19.735 --> 38:23.034
l liked it, Mr. Schneebly.
l thought it Was really catchy.

38:24.639 --> 38:26.335
Thank you.

38:27.041 --> 38:29.737
Mr. S? We came up
With some names for the band.

38:29.945 --> 38:32.378
- Yeah? Hit me.
- The Bumblebees?

38:32.581 --> 38:34.639
- No, it's sissy.
- The koala Bears?

38:34.849 --> 38:37.079
What are you talking about?
lt's sissy.

38:37.286 --> 38:39.583
l need to speak
With Principal Mullins.

38:39.788 --> 38:42.416
Hey, Miss Mullins. Hello.
HoW's it going?

38:42.623 --> 38:45.057
- HoW about ''Pig Rectum''?
- Michelle!

38:45.260 --> 38:46.851
lt's a science project.

38:47.061 --> 38:51.396
Listen, Ros, l Was thinking
about organizing a field trip.

38:51.599 --> 38:53.931
- What do you think about that?
- Well...

38:54.135 --> 38:57.230
...substitutes, as a rule,
do not organize field trips.

38:57.438 --> 38:59.998
But l figure l'm gonna be here
for a While.

39:00.208 --> 39:03.110
Well, that remains to be seen.

39:03.311 --> 39:05.711
- Have you met our other teachers?
- No.

39:05.914 --> 39:09.349
But the kids could learn
by getting out of the classroom.

39:09.550 --> 39:12.782
lt's more complicated than that.
There's safety issues.

39:12.987 --> 39:16.389
Parents need to be notified.
lt's against school policy.

39:16.592 --> 39:19.492
Mr. S, l have a lot of ideas.

39:19.695 --> 39:22.891
HoW about everyone in magenta
With beads and sequins?

39:23.097 --> 39:25.726
Billy, l'm talking to Principal Mullins.

39:25.934 --> 39:27.958
- Oh, hi.
- William.

39:28.269 --> 39:29.760
l'll make up some samples.

39:30.438 --> 39:34.340
Everyone, this is Ned Schneebly.
He's covering for Gail.

39:34.543 --> 39:37.478
Gabe Green. He teaches second.
Jane Lemmons, fourth.

39:37.679 --> 39:38.976
Bob's our P.E. teacher.

39:39.181 --> 39:41.581
- Roberta's our librarian.
- HoW do you do?

39:41.784 --> 39:44.411
- Care to join us, Mr. Schneebly?
- Yeah.

39:44.619 --> 39:49.250
- Did l say that correctly? ''Schneebly''?
- Actually, it's ''Schnayblay''.

39:49.458 --> 39:51.358
We Were just discussing testing.

39:51.559 --> 39:55.427
Which test do you find most effective,
the TASS or the Wilson-Binet?

39:55.831 --> 39:58.822
l say no testing,
and l Will tell you Why, Joe.

39:59.034 --> 40:02.025
- Gabe.
- Gabe. l believe...

40:02.237 --> 40:05.070
...that the children are the future.

40:05.273 --> 40:06.969
NoW, you can teach them Well,

40:07.175 --> 40:09.507
but you have gotta let them
lead the Way.

40:10.045 --> 40:12.478
Let the children's laughter...

40:12.681 --> 40:14.672
...just remind us
hoW We used to be.

40:15.083 --> 40:17.746
That's What l decided long ago.

40:18.753 --> 40:20.346
lsn't that a song?

40:21.456 --> 40:24.688
No. l don't think so. No.

40:24.893 --> 40:26.190
- No?
- No, it isn't.

40:26.394 --> 40:27.952
You sure?

40:30.666 --> 40:37.003
So you think you'll be just fine
Without me, but you're mine

40:37.206 --> 40:42.074
y ou think you can
Kick me out of the band

40:43.244 --> 40:46.577
Well, there's just one problem there

40:46.782 --> 40:49.648
The band is mine

40:49.851 --> 40:53.913
HoW can you kick me out
Of What is mine?

40:54.123 --> 40:55.351
Everybody.

40:55.556 --> 40:58.650
- Because you're not hardcore
- No, you're not hardcore

40:58.860 --> 41:01.829
- Unless you live hardcore
- Unless you live hardcore

41:02.030 --> 41:07.092
But the legend of the rent
Was Way hardcore

41:07.302 --> 41:09.269
All right. Good. Stop.

41:09.471 --> 41:11.166
Ok, Freddy, that Was aWesome.

41:11.373 --> 41:13.898
You're rocking,
but it's a little sloppy-joe.

41:14.108 --> 41:16.474
Tighten up the screWs, Ok?

41:16.677 --> 41:19.840
Zack, dude, What's up
With the stiffness, man?

41:20.047 --> 41:23.539
You're looking a little robotronic.
Ok?

41:23.751 --> 41:26.721
Let's grease up the hinges,
and listen,

41:26.922 --> 41:29.755
loosey-goosey, baby,
loosey-goosey.

41:29.958 --> 41:33.586
- l'm playing it the Way you told me.
- l knoW, it's perfect.

41:33.795 --> 41:37.731
But rock is about the passion, man.
Where's the joy?

41:37.932 --> 41:41.699
You're lead guitarist. We are
counting on you for style, brother.

41:41.903 --> 41:45.635
So try out this ancient technique.
lt's called ''poWer stance''.

41:45.840 --> 41:48.206
That's it. You oWn the universe.

41:48.409 --> 41:50.878
NoW give me an E chord.
Just go:

41:51.646 --> 41:53.773
But let me hear:

41:54.550 --> 41:58.884
Yeah, noW raise your goblet of rock.
lt's a toast to those Who rock.

41:59.086 --> 42:02.545
NoW smile and nod your head
and let me see your eyeballs Wide

42:02.757 --> 42:04.918
like there's something Wrong.
Yeah!

42:05.126 --> 42:07.027
Do it again. Give me that:

42:08.797 --> 42:11.856
That's What l'm talking about.
Ok, let's do it again,

42:12.067 --> 42:14.534
from ''You're not hardcore''.
One, tWo, three.

42:14.735 --> 42:17.534
- y ou're not hardcore
- No, you're not hardcore

48:53.867 --> 48:57.326
Yo-Yo Ma's cousin, little ''nepotis''.

48:57.539 --> 49:00.632
Anyway, l just decided to give up
and become a teacher,

49:00.842 --> 49:04.005
because those that can't do, teach.

49:04.211 --> 49:08.307

58:00.248 --> 58:02.215
l Was hanging With real rockers.

58:02.416 --> 58:04.748
They aren't real rockers.
They're posers.

58:04.952 --> 58:07.715
Rock ain't about getting loaded
and being a jerk.

58:07.922 --> 58:11.824
NoW, this is serious business here.
We've got a mission.

58:12.025 --> 58:14.960
Putting on a great shoW
is the most important thing.

58:15.163 --> 58:18.030
One great rock shoW
can change the World.

58:18.231 --> 58:21.257
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah.

58:21.469 --> 58:24.369
lf you ever scare me like that again,
so help me,

58:24.572 --> 58:27.369
l Will send a note home
to your parents. Let's go.

58:28.108 --> 58:30.942

58:38.318 --> 58:42.016
- Auditions are over.

58:42.222 --> 58:45.351
Listen...you can't leave.
You haven't heard our band.

58:45.559 --> 58:49.257
- The bill is full. We're overbooked.
- Let us play one song.

58:49.463 --> 58:50.793
We're here. We're ready.

58:50.998 --> 58:52.396
- Who are they?
- My band.

58:52.733 --> 58:54.893
kids? ls this some kind
of gimmick?

58:55.101 --> 58:58.128
lt's not a gimmick.
They're kids, but they're aWesome.

58:58.338 --> 59:02.275
Thanks for coming doWn, but you're
really not What We're looking for.

59:02.476 --> 59:05.172
These kids have Worked
their fingers to the bone

59:05.378 --> 59:09.144
just to play one song for you,
so sit doWn, shut up and listen!

59:09.483 --> 59:12.713
Sheila, call security.

59:15.255 --> 59:17.349
Oh, God.

59:18.659 --> 59:20.126
lt Was just a Warm-up.

59:20.327 --> 59:22.922
We'll still compete
against the other schools.

59:23.130 --> 59:26.588
What? This is the gig, Summer.
This Was our Woodstock.

59:26.800 --> 59:29.030
Then We shouldn't take no
for an ansWer.

59:29.237 --> 59:32.434
Don't take no for an ansWer?
He Was gonna call the fuzz.

59:32.639 --> 59:34.630
Would you just listen to me?

59:35.141 --> 59:37.007

59:40.248 --> 59:44.514
Hi there. Hi. lt's Ok. lt's cool.
l just Wanted to say, l'm really sorry.

59:44.719 --> 59:46.880
l shouldn't have barged in here.

59:47.088 --> 59:49.021
lt Wasn't fair to you or the kids,

59:49.222 --> 59:51.623
especially after What
they've been through.

59:51.826 --> 59:55.728
God, l feel like a jerk. God.
l'm taking them back to the hospital.

59:55.929 --> 59:58.592
- Just Wanted to say l'm sorry.
- That's fine.

59:58.798 --> 01:00:02.826
See, l volunteer doWn at
St. Margarita's, in the children's Wing,

01:00:03.036 --> 01:00:05.266
- teaching music.
- Really? That's nice.

01:00:05.472 --> 01:00:07.907
- That's very nice.
- Actually, it isn't,

01:00:08.108 --> 01:00:11.840
because l totally screWed up.
l told the kids if they practiced,

01:00:12.045 --> 01:00:14.947
they'd get into
Battle of the Bands.

01:00:15.248 --> 01:00:18.650
- What did you tell them that for?
- l don't knoW. l just...

01:00:18.853 --> 01:00:23.516
l Wanted to give them something to
look forward to, to keep their spirits up.

01:00:24.125 --> 01:00:25.853
Look at them.

01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:28.228
They're terminal.

01:00:28.862 --> 01:00:30.228
Every last one of them.

01:00:34.235 --> 01:00:36.601
- Jeez.
- Yeah, and all they Wanted to do

01:00:36.804 --> 01:00:39.967
before they bit the dust
Was play Battle of the Bands.

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:41.907
What do they all have?

01:00:43.143 --> 01:00:45.442
lt's a...

01:00:45.646 --> 01:00:50.514
lt's a rare blood disease.
''Stick-it-to-da-man-niosis''.

01:00:51.719 --> 01:00:54.016
What's that?
l've never heard of it.

01:00:54.221 --> 01:00:57.213
You're lucky. Because it's hell.

01:00:57.791 --> 01:00:59.487
WoW.

01:01:10.603 --> 01:01:12.628
- We're on the bill.
- Yes!

01:01:13.273 --> 01:01:16.106
Cut it out! You're dying, remember?

01:01:18.278 --> 01:01:19.905
Get in the van.

01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:38.391
We come from the land
Of the ice and snoW

01:01:38.599 --> 01:01:41.396
From the midnight sun
Where the hot springs bloW

01:01:41.601 --> 01:01:43.865
The hammer of the gods

01:01:44.137 --> 01:01:47.471
Summer, you get an A-plus
and 50 gold stars.

01:01:48.041 --> 01:01:51.135
- l didn't do it for the grade.
- Give me some of that.

01:01:51.344 --> 01:01:53.710
Yeah! Yeah!

01:02:02.757 --> 01:02:05.123
And it Was so scary.

01:02:18.338 --> 01:02:20.398
Hey, Mr. S?

01:02:20.641 --> 01:02:22.733
We have a name for the band.

01:02:22.943 --> 01:02:24.501
Hit me.

01:02:28.548 --> 01:02:30.744
The School of Rock.

01:02:32.952 --> 01:02:36.889
The School of Rock.

01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:45.159
And We shall teach
rock 'n' roll to the World.

01:02:45.365 --> 01:02:51.032
There's no Way you can stop

01:02:51.438 --> 01:02:56.034
The School of Rock
y eah

01:02:56.610 --> 01:02:59.043
Stop. We have a red alert.
lt's Mullins.

01:02:59.246 --> 01:03:01.271
Let's go. Come on.

01:03:01.614 --> 01:03:04.811
To your positions.
To your positions!

01:03:08.121 --> 01:03:10.181
Come on, come on.

01:03:17.764 --> 01:03:23.168
And therefore, E=MC2.

01:03:23.369 --> 01:03:25.132
Oh, Miss Mullins. Come in.

01:03:25.338 --> 01:03:29.536
l'm sorry to interrupt, but Miss
Lemmons said she heard music

01:03:29.742 --> 01:03:33.509
- coming from the classroom.
- Music?

01:03:34.715 --> 01:03:37.581
Music. l haven't heard any music.

01:03:37.784 --> 01:03:41.550
You knoW What? Miss Lemmons
must be on crack, right, kids?

01:03:43.289 --> 01:03:47.090
Well... Well, What's that?

01:03:51.699 --> 01:03:54.030
Oh, that. Yeah.

01:03:54.235 --> 01:03:57.101
We Were singing. We Were singing
and learning.

01:03:58.371 --> 01:04:01.101
We Were learning in sing-song.

01:04:02.610 --> 01:04:05.271
- One of your methods?
- Yeah.

01:04:05.478 --> 01:04:08.539
l find it's helpful When
you're teaching the subjects

01:04:08.748 --> 01:04:11.081
that are the boring subjects.

01:04:13.653 --> 01:04:20.081
Well, you don't mind if l just sit in
on your class this afternoon, do you?

01:04:20.293 --> 01:04:22.956
No. No. Come on back
this afternoon.

01:04:23.163 --> 01:04:25.289
lt is the afternoon. l meant noW.

01:04:27.233 --> 01:04:31.864
So please just continue
With your method.

01:04:32.438 --> 01:04:35.340
Yeah. Ok.

01:04:51.291 --> 01:04:55.422
Math is a Wonderful thing

01:04:56.730 --> 01:05:00.563
Math is a really cool thing

01:05:01.135 --> 01:05:03.467
So get off your ''ath''
Let's do some math

01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:07.038
Math, math, math, math, math

01:05:09.143 --> 01:05:13.670
- Three minus four is...
- Negative one.

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:15.347
That's right.

01:05:15.815 --> 01:05:20.809
And six times a billion is...

01:05:22.623 --> 01:05:25.148
- Six billion?
- Nailed it.

01:05:25.358 --> 01:05:30.353
And 54 is 45 more than...
What is the ansWer, Marta?

01:05:30.563 --> 01:05:33.965
- Nine.
- No, it's eight

01:05:36.003 --> 01:05:38.436
No, it's nine

01:05:39.773 --> 01:05:45.369
y es, l Was testing you
lt's nine

01:05:45.579 --> 01:05:49.173
And that's a magic number

01:05:52.119 --> 01:05:55.349
l'm very happy that you're able
to extend your stay,

01:05:55.556 --> 01:06:01.425
but l must say, l find your methods
of teaching very unusual.

01:06:01.628 --> 01:06:06.224
Well, l did study With
Dr. Errol Von Straussenburgerbecken.

01:06:06.699 --> 01:06:09.099
- Who?
- Oh, you don't knoW him?

01:06:09.302 --> 01:06:15.572
Oh, he's, like, one of the leading
leaders in...unusual methods.

01:06:15.775 --> 01:06:19.905
Actually, he's hoW l Was appointed
to the Presidential Council

01:06:20.179 --> 01:06:22.842
for Experimental Educationers.

01:06:23.050 --> 01:06:24.677
That sounds very impressive,

01:06:24.885 --> 01:06:29.184
but We're not interested
in experimental education here.

01:06:29.722 --> 01:06:34.751
So if from noW on you could just stick
to the curriculum, that Would be great.

01:06:34.961 --> 01:06:37.396
- Yes. Right.
- Thank you.

01:06:37.864 --> 01:06:39.559
Ros?

01:06:40.067 --> 01:06:41.762
- Yes?
- Do you knoW,

01:06:41.969 --> 01:06:46.905
l Would really love to talk some more
about your philosophy on teaching.

01:06:47.106 --> 01:06:49.905
Do you think maybe We could
grab some coffee?

01:06:50.177 --> 01:06:52.371
You Want to go
get some coffee With me?

01:06:52.913 --> 01:06:54.402
Yeah. l really Would.

01:07:01.054 --> 01:07:05.923
- You're sure you don't have coffee?
- l'm quite sure.

01:07:08.429 --> 01:07:12.126
Well, l've never been here before.

01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:18.067
l've never been to this side
of toWn before, in fact.

01:07:19.005 --> 01:07:21.405
So l have been...

01:07:21.608 --> 01:07:27.012
Well, l've been... l've been dying
to ask you something, Mr. Schneebly.

01:07:27.213 --> 01:07:30.980
- Please, call me ''DeWey''.
- DeWey?

01:07:31.818 --> 01:07:34.788
Ned. Call me ''Ned''.

01:07:34.987 --> 01:07:38.753
l Was thinking of my other name.
My middle name.

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:42.793
- Yeah.
- Well, Ned...

01:07:45.865 --> 01:07:48.925
...in your experience,
hoW does Horace Green compare

01:07:49.135 --> 01:07:51.570
to the other schools
that you've taught at?

01:07:51.771 --> 01:07:53.797
Oh, your school is the best.

01:07:54.541 --> 01:07:56.599
- You're just saying that.
- l'm not.

01:07:56.809 --> 01:08:00.371
You knoW that kids at other schools
just have fun all the time?

01:08:00.581 --> 01:08:04.608
They run around. There's no discipline.
They're happy. lt's anarchy.

01:08:04.818 --> 01:08:08.617
This is the best school
l have ever teached at. l sWear.

01:08:09.523 --> 01:08:11.490
l'll drink to that.

01:08:17.831 --> 01:08:20.162
Stay there. l'm gonna put on
some music.

01:08:57.569 --> 01:09:00.131
- l love this song.
- Really?

01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:02.831
- Yes. Stevie Nicks.
- Yeah.

01:09:03.310 --> 01:09:04.572
Stevie!

01:09:04.778 --> 01:09:07.939
You knoW, she came to toWn,
and she did a concert,

01:09:08.148 --> 01:09:12.810
- and she Was just so...Wild.
- l knoW. Oh, man.

01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:15.921
- Oh, my gosh.
- She put on the best shoW ever.

01:09:17.858 --> 01:09:20.256
She's better live
than she is on the album.

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:22.519
- You knoW What l mean?
- Yes, yes.

01:09:22.729 --> 01:09:26.028
- Oh, my gosh, no comparison.
- Yeah.

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:27.932
You knoW What?

01:09:28.301 --> 01:09:31.362
Oh, man, l Would love
to take the kids to a concert.

01:09:31.572 --> 01:09:32.903
- Concert?
- Yeah.

01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:35.970
There's one at the end
of the month.

01:09:36.176 --> 01:09:40.703
The Philharmonic. They do classics.
They do Beethoven, Mozart...

01:09:41.381 --> 01:09:43.679
...Enya, that kind of stuff.

01:09:46.319 --> 01:09:48.845
But you have a policy
about field trips.

01:09:49.988 --> 01:09:53.287
- Would it be educational?
- Would it be educational?

01:09:53.493 --> 01:09:55.984
lt could be very educational.

01:09:58.998 --> 01:10:01.229
- Maybe We can make an exception.
- Yes!

01:10:01.435 --> 01:10:03.460
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing

01:10:04.136 --> 01:10:07.037
Ooh, baby, ooh, ooh

01:10:07.573 --> 01:10:09.769
l'm holding you to that.

01:10:10.010 --> 01:10:11.738
Make an exception.

01:10:12.945 --> 01:10:16.779
Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh

01:10:21.087 --> 01:10:22.315
TomorroW

01:10:22.956 --> 01:10:29.225
Keeping your head over Water
Making a Wave When you can

01:10:29.429 --> 01:10:32.591
Temporary layoff
Good time

01:10:32.798 --> 01:10:35.996
Easy credit rip-off
Good time

01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:40.497
Scratching and surviving
Good time

01:10:40.707 --> 01:10:42.731
Would you stop that, please?

01:10:42.943 --> 01:10:44.376
Yeah.

01:10:45.811 --> 01:10:50.373
- l had a really nice time.
- Yeah, ditto.

01:10:50.884 --> 01:10:53.444
This is the first time
a teacher has asked me

01:10:53.654 --> 01:10:56.987
- to do anything outside of school.
- No Way.

01:10:57.256 --> 01:10:59.350
lt's... lt's true.

01:10:59.626 --> 01:11:02.423
ln six years.

01:11:04.398 --> 01:11:06.332
Well, you knoW,

01:11:06.533 --> 01:11:10.525
l think it might be one of those things
Where people are intimidated.

01:11:10.737 --> 01:11:13.466
lntimidated?

01:11:13.673 --> 01:11:15.505
- They hate me.
- No. They don't.

01:11:15.708 --> 01:11:18.506
Yes, they do. They sure do.
l can see.

01:11:18.712 --> 01:11:20.612
l Wasn't alWays like this.

01:11:20.814 --> 01:11:24.716
l Wasn't alWays Wound this tight.
There Was a time When l Was fun.

01:11:25.051 --> 01:11:28.145
l Was funny. l Was.

01:11:28.354 --> 01:11:34.692
But you can't be funny and be
the principal of a prep school.

01:11:34.895 --> 01:11:38.091
No, you cannot, because
When it comes to their kids,

01:11:38.297 --> 01:11:41.391
these parents,
they have no sense of humor.

01:11:42.101 --> 01:11:46.835
lf anything goes Wrong, it's my head.
lt's my head in the smasher.

01:11:47.039 --> 01:11:51.340
These parents Will come doWn
on me like a nuclear bomb.

01:11:51.545 --> 01:11:54.707
l can't make a mistake.
l gotta be perfect.

01:11:54.914 --> 01:12:01.184
And that pressure has turned me into
one thing that l never Wanted to be.

l don't knoW. l...

01:12:47.868 --> 01:12:50.359
They might be a little distracting.

01:12:50.569 --> 01:12:54.233
lt's glitter rock and it's glam
and it's fabulous.

01:12:55.809 --> 01:12:58.175
Billy, it's just not the right style.

01:12:58.377 --> 01:13:00.538
You're gonna talk to me
about style?

01:13:00.747 --> 01:13:03.408
You can't dress yourself.
Look at that boW tie.

01:13:03.617 --> 01:13:05.413
Don't talk about my boW tie.

01:13:05.618 --> 01:13:09.350
You knoW What, l give up.
They can just Wear their uniforms.

01:13:09.989 --> 01:13:14.119
- That's not a bad idea.
- Not a bad idea?

01:13:14.327 --> 01:13:16.886
- l Was kidding.

01:13:18.064 --> 01:13:22.001
- Hey, hey. What is that?

01:13:22.202 --> 01:13:25.432

- Just something l Wrote.

01:13:25.671 --> 01:13:26.969
You Wrote a song?

01:13:28.608 --> 01:13:32.009
- Well, let's hear it.
- No, it's not that good.

01:13:32.378 --> 01:13:35.439
Come on, l Want to hear it,
kurt Cobain.

01:13:36.315 --> 01:13:39.284
- Ok, but l'm not much of a singer.
- lt's all right.

01:13:41.887 --> 01:13:44.948
Baby, We Were making straight A's

01:13:45.158 --> 01:13:48.149
But We Were stuck in a dumb daze

01:13:48.795 --> 01:13:52.252
Don't take much
To memorize your lies

01:13:52.466 --> 01:13:54.524
Feel like l've been hypnotized

01:13:54.734 --> 01:13:59.398
Wait. You Wrote that?
You Wrote that?

01:14:00.006 --> 01:14:02.439
That's it.
Guys, rock 'n' roll positions.

01:14:02.641 --> 01:14:05.509

01:14:05.712 --> 01:14:08.112
- But Why?
- That's What bands do, man.

01:14:08.347 --> 01:14:10.872
Play each other's songs.
You got lyrics?

01:14:11.518 --> 01:14:13.212
Hook me up.

01:14:15.055 --> 01:14:17.956
No more secret songs.
All right, LaWrence,

01:14:18.158 --> 01:14:20.921

01:14:21.261 --> 01:14:23.729
Get on the drum. Bass it up.

01:14:23.930 --> 01:14:25.420

- Baby, We Were making straight A's
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:14:36.408 --> 01:14:39.400
But We Were stuck in a dumb daze

01:14:39.613 --> 01:14:42.104
Don't take much
To memorize your lies

01:14:42.314 --> 01:14:45.841
And if you Wanna be
The teacher's pet

01:14:46.051 --> 01:14:49.078
Baby, you just better forget it

01:14:49.288 --> 01:14:52.122
Rock is the reason
Rock is the rhyme

01:14:52.324 --> 01:14:54.622
knoW What Would be better?

01:14:54.828 --> 01:14:57.421
''Rock got no reason,
Rock got no rhyme.''

01:14:57.631 --> 01:15:02.694
Can We try that? Also, We need
some ''ooh la-la's'', so like:

01:15:02.903 --> 01:15:05.394
Try that. Can We take
it from the chorus?

01:15:05.604 --> 01:15:08.233
One, tWo, three, four.
One, tWo, three.

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:11.877
And if you Wanna be
The teacher's pet

01:15:12.078 --> 01:15:15.137
Baby, you just better forget it

01:15:15.347 --> 01:15:18.442
Rock got no reason
Rock got no rhyme

01:15:19.152 --> 01:15:25.148
y ou'd better get me to school on time
And if you Wanna be the teacher's pet

01:15:25.358 --> 01:15:28.384
Baby, you just better forget it

01:15:28.595 --> 01:15:32.395
Rock got no reason
Rock got no rhyme

01:15:32.599 --> 01:15:36.296
y ou better get me to school on time

01:15:44.344 --> 01:15:47.073

01:15:47.279 --> 01:15:49.247
- All right.

01:15:49.448 --> 01:15:52.645
- Ok.
- Let me rock a solo there, l can feel it.

00:01.238 --> 00:03.570
TomorroW is the big day,
so get your rest.

00:03.774 --> 00:07.176
No late parties, drinking tequila
and trying to get lucky.

00:08.545 --> 00:11.538
Chances like this do not
come around every day.

00:12.083 --> 00:13.710
You've played hard in here,

00:13.917 --> 00:17.580
and l am proud of every
last stinking one of you.

00:18.522 --> 00:22.289
Let's just give this everything We got.
We may fall on our faces,

00:22.492 --> 00:25.518
but if We do,
We Will fall With dignity!

00:25.929 --> 00:28.728
With a guitar in our hands
and rock in our hearts!

00:28.932 --> 00:30.923
And in the Words of AC/DC:

00:31.135 --> 00:34.832
''We roll tonight to the guitar bite,

00:35.039 --> 00:38.439
''and for those about to rock...

00:38.643 --> 00:40.576
''...l salute you.''

00:54.759 --> 00:58.661
Ros, excuse me, Wanted to remind
you about our field trip tomorroW.

00:58.862 --> 01:02.491
- What field trip?
- The educational concert.

01:02.700 --> 01:05.031
Oh, l forgot about that.

01:05.236 --> 01:09.194
l don't knoW, school policy
is very difficult to get around.

01:09.406 --> 01:11.966
But you said
We could make an exception,

01:12.176 --> 01:15.076
and the kids are excited
about hearing some Mozart.

01:15.278 --> 01:19.510
l knoW, but the preparations,
there's not enough time.

01:19.716 --> 01:22.185
l don't knoW anything about it.
Where is it?

01:22.587 --> 01:27.216
l've got it all covered.
What's going on, are you mad at me?

01:27.424 --> 01:30.621
No, no, Ned. l'm sorry,
l'm just a little stressed out

01:30.828 --> 01:32.852
because it's Parents' Night tonight.

01:33.063 --> 01:37.796
Hey, it's all gonna be fine.

01:40.971 --> 01:46.341
Ned, Would you mind coming
With me tonight to Parents' Night?

01:46.977 --> 01:51.243
lt Wouldn't be a date or anything.
l get nervous around the parents,

01:51.448 --> 01:55.111
and there's something about you
that makes me feel more relaxed.

01:55.319 --> 01:58.049
You knoW What,
that sounds so great, Ros, but...

01:59.390 --> 02:03.849
- But What?
- l Wasn't planning on going tonight.

02:04.128 --> 02:08.394
You have to. You're their teacher.
You have to give the presentation.

02:08.598 --> 02:12.228
Oh, yeah, yeah. No, l got you.
l'm ready for that.

02:12.637 --> 02:14.298
So We'll go together?

02:14.504 --> 02:19.237
Ok. Why don't you pick me up at,

02:19.443 --> 02:22.002

02:28.451 --> 02:33.616
- What are you all dressed up for?
- l got a hot date.

02:34.157 --> 02:35.647
That's Weird.

02:35.860 --> 02:39.318
l got a check from Horace
Green Prep for $1 ,200.

02:39.931 --> 02:41.489
l've never Worked there.

02:44.401 --> 02:47.860
- What are you doing?
- Calling the school.

02:49.272 --> 02:51.673
Hi, this is Ned Schneebly...

02:55.680 --> 02:57.271
DeWey?

02:57.480 --> 02:58.846
What's going on?

02:59.050 --> 03:01.883
l told them 1 5 times,
make it out to cash!

03:03.687 --> 03:05.086
DeWey?

03:05.889 --> 03:07.858
l did something bad, Ned.

03:08.391 --> 03:10.223
- No.
- Yeah.

03:10.427 --> 03:13.829
They called for a sub. l said
l Was you, to make some money.

03:14.031 --> 03:17.228
But then l got there, and the kids,
they rock, man.

03:17.435 --> 03:21.394
There's this kid Larry Who's like,
''l'm not cool,'' but noW he's like:

03:23.274 --> 03:25.741
There's this other girl
Who can sing like:

03:26.110 --> 03:30.740
She thought she Was too fat, so they
Were dying, and the principal got drunk.

03:30.948 --> 03:34.747
NoW We're playing Battle of the Bands.
lt's the coolest thing!

03:34.951 --> 03:37.112
One day.
Then l Will come clean.

03:37.320 --> 03:41.382
l'll tell everyone it Was my fault.
You'll be fine. One day!

03:41.592 --> 03:43.855
- Ned, home.
- Don't say anything to her.

03:44.061 --> 03:46.586
She'll bloW everything. Please?

03:50.467 --> 03:53.231
Hey. What's going on?

03:54.070 --> 03:57.562
Nothing. l got a hot date,
that's What's going on.

04:00.311 --> 04:02.175
See you later.

04:08.419 --> 04:10.147
What's going on, Ned?

04:11.855 --> 04:14.518
- Nothing.
- Nothing? Well...

04:29.673 --> 04:33.473
Ok, l don't think l can go in there.

04:34.644 --> 04:37.204
- What's Wrong?
- Ros...

04:38.716 --> 04:40.274
...l'm not a teacher.

04:41.351 --> 04:44.913
Oh, Ned. A substitute is a teacher.

04:45.122 --> 04:48.716
No, no. l'm not a teacher.
l'm a fraud.

04:48.925 --> 04:51.416
No. You're not.

04:51.629 --> 04:56.430
You're a dedicated, talented teacher,
and those parents are gonna love you.

04:56.634 --> 05:01.333
Just get in there and tell those parents
What you've been teaching their kids.

05:01.639 --> 05:05.074
Yeah, you knoW, math, English...

05:06.610 --> 05:10.910
What...? Science... What else?
Geography, history,

05:11.115 --> 05:14.709
Latin, Spanish, French,

05:14.918 --> 05:19.117
Latin... Math.
Did l say that already?

05:19.322 --> 05:25.158
Anyway, all the stuff you Want your
kids to knoW, it's been covered, Ok?

05:25.362 --> 05:27.160
So...

05:28.899 --> 05:32.665
...it Was great to meet you all,
and drive safe.

05:32.870 --> 05:34.235
Excuse me.

05:34.437 --> 05:37.372
Since you started,
all my son talks about is music.

05:37.574 --> 05:41.670
He says he Wants to be a musician.
ls this your influence?

05:41.879 --> 05:45.076
Why has my daughter become
obsessed With David Geffen?

05:45.281 --> 05:47.079
And hoW is this homeWork?

05:47.384 --> 05:51.879
Ok, see, l Would like to tell you about
What We've been doing in here,

05:52.088 --> 05:55.923
but there's such a thing as
teacher-student confidentiality,

05:56.127 --> 05:59.119
and l don't Want to be in breach
of educational laW

05:59.329 --> 06:03.357
because l could be dismembered
by the teacher's union.

06:03.634 --> 06:04.862
So...

06:05.069 --> 06:07.502
You expect us to believe
this garbage?

06:08.773 --> 06:12.435
Mr. S, don't you think you should
tell them about the project?

06:12.642 --> 06:14.872
- What project?
- Our class project.

06:15.079 --> 06:17.240
Every school in the state
is competing.

06:17.447 --> 06:19.973
- Competing?
- lt's not till next quarter,

06:20.184 --> 06:22.413
but Mr. S Wanted us
to get a head start.

06:22.620 --> 06:25.850
- Well, What's the project, Summer?
- lt's prestigious.

06:26.057 --> 06:28.286
A Win Will go on our permanent record.

06:30.560 --> 06:32.892
You might as Well tell them,
Mr. Schneebly.

06:33.096 --> 06:38.125
Ok, look. l've gotten to knoW your kids
the past feW Weeks. They're aWesome.

06:38.334 --> 06:42.567
Zack is an insane guitarist.
He's the next Hendrix, and he's 1 0.

06:42.773 --> 06:44.899
And Gordon here, he's a genius!

06:45.108 --> 06:49.637
He did a Whole professional light shoW
on his computer in three days. And...

06:50.548 --> 06:52.846
And Marta here, she's...

06:53.050 --> 06:55.814
She can hit an A above high C.
Did you knoW that?

06:56.019 --> 06:59.456
Because that's tough.
Not many singers can do that. And...

07:02.225 --> 07:06.458
Summer is gonna be the first Woman
president of the United States.

07:06.663 --> 07:09.291
She could run this year.
l Would vote for her.

07:09.500 --> 07:14.300
Look, they're just really cool kids.
lf they Were mine, l Would be so proud.

07:14.504 --> 07:18.497
And l am proud,
just to even knoW them. And...

07:18.942 --> 07:21.673
Sir, can l see you in the hall
for a moment?

07:22.278 --> 07:24.509
Let me just say
a couple more things.

07:24.714 --> 07:27.047
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

07:27.250 --> 07:30.185
Apparently, that man
is not Ned Schneebly.

07:30.588 --> 07:32.680
- What?
- What?

07:32.889 --> 07:35.983
- This man is Ned Schneebly.
- He's not even a teacher.

07:36.192 --> 07:40.151
- You called the cops?
- She did. She got it out of me. Sorry.

07:40.363 --> 07:43.855
- You're apologizing to him?
- Sorry.

07:45.435 --> 07:47.062
Ned.

07:48.605 --> 07:51.005
Ned, is this true?

07:51.975 --> 07:53.237
Who are you?

07:55.178 --> 07:57.511
My name is DeWey Finn.

07:57.714 --> 08:03.084
And, no, l'm not a licensed teacher,
but l have been touched by your kids.

08:03.286 --> 08:05.949
And l'm pretty sure l've touched them.

08:12.963 --> 08:14.692
- What?
- Oh, my God.

08:30.314 --> 08:33.806
- l have nothing to say to you.
- Me either.

08:35.186 --> 08:37.779
Ok. l'm going to bed.

08:38.022 --> 08:40.182
lt's one thing to throW
your life aWay,

08:40.390 --> 08:42.881
but to put Ned in jeopardy
is selfish.

08:43.092 --> 08:45.527
You told me to be like Ned
and get a job.

08:45.729 --> 08:49.164
l told you to be like Ned,
l didn't tell you to be Ned.

08:49.365 --> 08:53.200
- You're not gonna apologize?
- You apologize for calling the cops.

08:53.403 --> 08:56.498
l didn't murder anybody.
l Wanted to play a great shoW.

08:56.706 --> 09:00.143
- l Was this close.
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

09:00.344 --> 09:04.006
Would you both just cut it out
for one second?

09:10.788 --> 09:14.052
Look, l'm sorry, dude.
l Was desperate.

09:14.658 --> 09:17.091
lt Was easy for you to give up music.

09:17.293 --> 09:20.821
- lt ain't easy for me.
- lt Wasn't easy for me.

09:21.065 --> 09:22.429
l miss it.

09:22.633 --> 09:24.725
Well, then Why'd you give it up?

09:24.934 --> 09:27.768
Because l couldn't keep
kidding myself anymore.

09:27.971 --> 09:30.941
You can blame it all on bad luck,
but in the end,

09:31.140 --> 09:33.506
maybe We just Weren't that good.

09:34.177 --> 09:36.543
