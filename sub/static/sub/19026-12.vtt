WEBVTT

00:06.520 --> 00:07.509
Almost there.

00:09.400 --> 00:12.437
All the way from the parking lot.
I told you I could do it!

00:12.520 --> 00:14.556
Who's the idiot now?

00:16.200 --> 00:19.636
<i>Despite my burning thighs, giving</i>
<i>that piggyback ride was worth it,</i>

00:19.720 --> 00:21.836
<i>because I'm sure it put him</i>
<i>in a great mood.</i>

00:21.920 --> 00:24.309
- I'm in a worse mood.
- <i>Why did I do it?</i>

00:24.400 --> 00:26.550
Kelso's got this stupid outreach program

00:26.640 --> 00:29.154
where families are allowed
to observe surgeries.

00:29.240 --> 00:31.708
Yesterday, I had to do
a bypass on this guy.

00:32.080 --> 00:34.071
You should have seen that family...

00:34.720 --> 00:38.554
Standing there emotionless.
Silently judging me.

00:38.640 --> 00:41.871
And today I gotta do
a colectomy on that guy.

00:42.800 --> 00:45.678
What do you think
his family's gonna be like?

00:46.680 --> 00:48.079
There's a tumour in there!

00:48.160 --> 00:51.470
- There's a tumour in there!
- Don't go behind the kidney, brother!

00:55.520 --> 00:57.317
You didn't go to the black family

00:57.400 --> 00:59.868
yelling at the movie screen
stereotype, did you?

00:59.960 --> 01:01.473
Like a bear to honey.

01:01.560 --> 01:03.915
I was supposed to
be downstairs ten minutes ago

01:04.000 --> 01:07.117
to talk to pre-med students
about what it's like to be a doctor.

01:07.200 --> 01:08.918
Don't worry. I gotcha.

01:11.440 --> 01:13.351
Buckle up, buddy.

01:19.240 --> 01:20.593
Hell, yeah!

01:20.680 --> 01:22.193
Hey, kids, I'm Dr Dorian.

01:22.280 --> 01:25.272
I'm sure you have lots of questions,
so let's get started.

01:25.680 --> 01:27.796
So basically, it's a topical application

01:27.880 --> 01:31.350
consisting of equal parts
triethanolamine and phenyl dimethicone.

01:31.440 --> 01:34.352
I suggest applying it
twice a day for extra hold, OK?

01:34.440 --> 01:36.670
Here's a sample tube, Reuben.

01:36.760 --> 01:40.548
Excellent query.
OK, then. Anybody else?

01:41.160 --> 01:42.673
Reuben again.

01:42.760 --> 01:46.150
What was your best moment in medicine?

01:46.240 --> 01:50.199
I'd say my best moment was probably
my second year, New Year's eve.

01:50.280 --> 01:53.556
A young pregnant woman
could barely make it to the hospital.

01:53.640 --> 01:56.791
She had her baby
right there on the ramp.

02:01.560 --> 02:03.551
You know, that's my first grandchild.

02:03.640 --> 02:05.153
Did you deliver him?

02:05.240 --> 02:07.117
No, I didn't. But I did watch.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.316
And I am a doctor.

02:09.400 --> 02:11.709
And you look amazing!

02:11.800 --> 02:14.758
So even though Dr Mickhead
actually delivered the kid,

02:14.840 --> 02:18.355
yours truly rang in
the new year with grandma.

02:20.120 --> 02:21.838
We had sex.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.516
That's how I do it.

02:25.600 --> 02:27.636
That was your best moment?

02:27.720 --> 02:28.994
I totally get it.

02:29.080 --> 02:30.752
Older ladies know how to work it.

02:30.840 --> 02:34.515
OK. Now you're in a bit of a pickle,
cos the older lady you're talking about

02:34.600 --> 02:37.717
better not be me and it sure
as hell better not be somebody else.

02:37.800 --> 02:41.759
- So, what do you have to say?
- Your favourite jeans are too tight.

02:41.840 --> 02:43.831
- They look ridiculous.
- What?!

02:43.920 --> 02:46.275
I'm in trouble anyway,
and it needed to be said.

02:46.360 --> 02:48.954
Unfortunately for you,
that's not true. Right?

02:51.920 --> 02:52.989
Wow.

02:53.080 --> 02:56.072
I'll tell you what my
best moment in medicine was.

02:57.360 --> 02:59.351
Damn! We lost him.

02:59.440 --> 03:02.477
- Call it.
- I'm not giving up on this guy.

03:02.560 --> 03:04.312
- Prop his hand up.
- What?

03:04.400 --> 03:06.436
I said prop his hand up!

03:14.720 --> 03:17.188
That's right. The miracle five.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.874
- You take this one, Perry.
- Great moment, dumb ass.

03:19.960 --> 03:23.430
Starts with a profound misunderstanding
of how the human body works,

03:23.520 --> 03:26.159
and winds up with you
shattering some old man's hand.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.514
Oh, yeah.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.591
Know what'd be neat?
If you took a second

03:29.680 --> 03:32.478
and thought about what your
best moment in medicine was.

03:39.040 --> 03:41.031
It would have been neat.

<i>There's nothing sadder than a young guy</i>

03:57.560 --> 04:01.394
<i>checking into the hospital during</i>
<i>holidays. I think I'll tell Elliot that.</i>

04:01.480 --> 04:05.268
Nothing sadder than a young guy checking
into the hospital on the holidays.

04:05.360 --> 04:06.475
Hi.

04:06.560 --> 04:07.709
That's my dad.

04:07.800 --> 04:09.279
Except that.

04:10.640 --> 04:12.358
And that.

04:12.440 --> 04:16.831
I've been so tired. Yesterday, when
the little man and I were wrestling,

04:16.920 --> 04:19.911
- he dropped me in ten seconds.
- I got him with a power kick.

04:20.959 --> 04:24.635
Hey! You brought Tyler
a new ice-cream cone.

04:24.720 --> 04:25.914
Sure.

04:27.160 --> 04:28.434
Thanks.

04:28.520 --> 04:30.351
It's a waffle cone.

04:30.440 --> 04:33.910
So, Mr Milligan, it turns out
you have a pretty serious case of mono.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.191
Don't you get that from kissing?

04:48.760 --> 04:51.194
There are other ways you can get it.

04:51.640 --> 04:52.629
Dr Cox.

04:52.720 --> 04:55.996
Hold that thought, Newbie.
One, two, three, four.

04:56.080 --> 04:58.514
My new thing is to count just exactly

04:58.600 --> 05:01.160
how many people in any
given room can kick your ass.

05:01.240 --> 05:05.995
- And in here, the number is four.
- Five, if you count Mrs Cross.

05:09.560 --> 05:12.711
The other day she went off her meds.
Slammed him with a tray.

05:13.720 --> 05:15.039
She came outta nowhere!

05:15.120 --> 05:17.793
Am I gonna get out of here
in time for Christmas?

05:17.880 --> 05:19.677
Tyler's mom isn't around anymore,

05:19.760 --> 05:22.274
and I'd hate to
ship him off to his grandparents'.

05:22.360 --> 05:24.396
You'll beat Santa home. I promise.

05:25.280 --> 05:27.271
Phyllis, outside.

05:27.360 --> 05:29.476
What the hell was that?

05:32.120 --> 05:34.270
That's one more point for Mrs Cross.

05:34.360 --> 05:38.114
But let's see how she enjoys
her beloved hard candy without...

05:38.200 --> 05:39.997
...her choppers.

05:40.080 --> 05:43.277
Newbie, you never promise a patient
that they're gonna be fine.

05:43.360 --> 05:45.555
Mr Milligan?
His blood pressure's low.

05:45.640 --> 05:46.959
He just has mono.

05:47.040 --> 05:49.429
For God's sakes.
Take a look around, would you?

05:49.520 --> 05:51.909
What's the difference
between your Mr Milligan

05:52.000 --> 05:53.831
and every other patient in this ICU?

05:53.920 --> 05:57.390
If the answer to that question
is that he's the only one young enough

05:57.480 --> 05:59.516
to have never made
a phone call like this:

05:59.600 --> 06:00.874
Hello?

06:00.960 --> 06:03.315
Operatah, gimme
Stuyvesant 45-45-45,

06:03.400 --> 06:04.628
then you would be right.

06:04.720 --> 06:06.392
But since I'm not in the mood

06:06.480 --> 06:08.948
to make some big, dramatic,
sweeping statement,

06:09.040 --> 06:11.952
I'll just tell you this:
God hates doctors. He truly does.

06:12.040 --> 06:13.871
You see all these old people in here?

06:13.960 --> 06:17.475
Any of them'd give about anything
to be able to sashay off this planet.

06:17.560 --> 06:20.472
But most are gonna stay
and live forever and ever and ever.

06:20.560 --> 06:21.754
And your Mr Milligan...

06:21.840 --> 06:24.434
Well, it turns out he's
just young enough to die.

06:24.520 --> 06:26.033
I mean, think about it.

06:26.120 --> 06:28.998
It's the holidays.
There's a sweet little kid involved.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.038
- Can't you just feel it?
- <i>I did feel it.</i>

06:33.120 --> 06:35.588
<i>I knew what Carla was</i>
<i>gonna say before she said it.</i>

06:35.680 --> 06:37.955
- Mr Milligan is unconscious.
- Let's go.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.594
<i>Think of your best moment in medicine.</i>

06:46.360 --> 06:48.157
Thanks for taking care of me, ma'am.

06:48.240 --> 06:51.869
If there is ever any way that I can
hook you up, you just call me at work.

06:51.960 --> 06:53.951
Don't worry about it.
So, what do you do?

06:54.040 --> 06:55.712
I raise and breed ponies.

06:57.120 --> 06:58.473
Ponies!

07:00.200 --> 07:01.838
Come on, Thunder!

07:01.920 --> 07:04.480
Can't be late for rounds again.
Let's go. Giddyap.

07:05.760 --> 07:09.389
Hey, would you keep an eye on Tyler here
while we take care of his dad?

07:09.480 --> 07:10.515
Hi!

07:10.600 --> 07:12.431
Yeah. I'm not that great with kids.

07:12.520 --> 07:14.909
They've got such tiny hands.
It's creepy.

07:15.880 --> 07:17.154
I'm leaving now.

07:19.720 --> 07:21.233
My dad's in the ICU.

07:21.320 --> 07:24.357
- What does that mean?
- That stands for Intensive Care Unit.

07:24.440 --> 07:26.749
It's where we put patients
who need extra care,

07:26.840 --> 07:28.831
like somebody who needs help breathing

07:28.920 --> 07:31.798
cos their lung collapsed,
or they had a brain aneurysm...

07:31.880 --> 07:35.190
Which is when a vessel ruptures,
and then blood pours into the...

07:36.720 --> 07:40.395
You know what? Forget it. Wanna
see someone worse off than your dad?

07:40.480 --> 07:42.914
- We call him "The head in the bed."
- OK.

07:56.880 --> 07:58.950
His cultures are back.
He's not septic.

07:59.040 --> 08:00.632
- Start him on dopamine.
- Done.

08:00.720 --> 08:02.153
- Scan his head.
- Ordered it.

08:02.240 --> 08:05.357
- I'd give Mrs Cross her teeth back.
- That I will not do!

08:06.120 --> 08:09.908
Hey, J.D. Turns out Mr Milligan
doesn't have insurance.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.913
Dr Kelso said once he's stable,
we have to bounce him to county.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.718
Sorry.

08:15.800 --> 08:20.191
Turk! If you go talk to Kelso for me,
I'll give you special Christmas gum.

08:20.280 --> 08:22.999
<i>This is actually Mrs Cross's</i>
<i>medicated denture gum,</i>

08:23.080 --> 08:24.877
<i>so you have to</i>
<i>sell it with your eyes.</i>

08:24.960 --> 08:26.871
<i>Sell it...</i>

08:26.960 --> 08:28.393
<i>Sell it...</i>

08:29.000 --> 08:30.399
OK.

08:33.440 --> 08:36.078
<i>Think of your best moment in medicine.</i>

08:39.559 --> 08:42.313
- So I said, "I can't do it on my own."
- Excuse me, sir.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.755
A man just fainted over there.
Are you a doctor?

08:44.840 --> 08:47.513
Not this weekend, son.
Another Bahama Mama, please.

08:47.600 --> 08:50.319
Easy on the Bahama.
Heavy on the Mama.

08:50.400 --> 08:51.958
How you doing?

08:55.440 --> 08:58.591
Dr Kelso, I know you told Carla
to bounce Mr Milligan to county,

08:58.680 --> 09:01.148
but it's Christmas, so...
What do you say?

09:01.240 --> 09:03.196
I'd say get me a 3-T form.

09:03.280 --> 09:04.713
3-T f...

09:04.800 --> 09:06.358
What's that?

09:06.440 --> 09:09.000
That's tough titties, Turkelton.

09:22.600 --> 09:23.589
Oh, God...

09:33.120 --> 09:36.396
So... what do you wanna be
when you grow up?

09:36.480 --> 09:37.799
A baseball player.

09:37.880 --> 09:40.030
I wanted to be
a ballerina when I was little,

09:40.120 --> 09:43.112
but according to my mom,
six-year-olds with mild scoliosis

09:43.200 --> 09:45.714
and giant man feet
aren't dancer material.

09:45.800 --> 09:48.189
Joke's on her,
cos I am currently waiting to hear

09:48.280 --> 09:51.238
if the St Martha's community
theatre'll let me work lights

09:51.320 --> 09:53.390
for their production of the <i>Nutcracker.</i>

09:54.440 --> 09:56.476
Can I have some chocolate milk?

09:58.560 --> 10:00.039
Here's a buck.

10:00.120 --> 10:02.839
There's a vending machine
right outside that door.

10:02.920 --> 10:05.480
Dr Reid, could you
sign this for me, please?

10:05.560 --> 10:09.394
Sure! So, what are you doing
this weekend, Laverne?

10:09.480 --> 10:12.517
Minding my own business.
How 'bout you?

10:12.600 --> 10:16.036
Hopefully lighting the crap
outta St Martha's auditorium.

10:16.120 --> 10:18.270
Yippee.

10:19.120 --> 10:21.429
<i>Think of your best moment in medicine.</i>

10:22.600 --> 10:23.589
Damn!

10:23.680 --> 10:25.830
A little club soda
will take that right out.

10:25.920 --> 10:29.390
- Thanks, Carla.
- You're welcome, Doctor.

10:32.120 --> 10:33.678
What's going on up there?

10:33.760 --> 10:37.116
Sorry. I was thinking about
the last time a doctor listened to me.

10:37.200 --> 10:38.189
Sometimes I...

10:38.280 --> 10:40.350
- Get the results of the scan?
- Negative.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.476
We're missing something in his history.

10:42.560 --> 10:46.189
When he came in, Mr Milligan said
he and his son'd been wrestling.

10:46.280 --> 10:48.589
My God! He just might have
goof-around-itis.

10:48.680 --> 10:51.433
We should also check him
for the silly-willies.

10:54.840 --> 10:57.149
It's OK. They're just stressed out.

10:57.240 --> 11:02.075
Anytime a doctor disrespects me,
I respond with a little note.

11:13.480 --> 11:15.277
Worth it.

11:15.760 --> 11:17.318
Are you swanning this guy?

11:17.400 --> 11:19.994
I don't need you checking
on me every five seconds.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.389
I have as much
medical expertise as anyone.

11:23.840 --> 11:25.398
Now, what exactly is swanning?

11:25.480 --> 11:26.549
- What?
- I'm kidding!

11:26.640 --> 11:28.676
Enough back-seat doctoring.
I got this.

11:28.760 --> 11:31.035
<i>Why does it seem like</i>
<i>every time I take a stand,</i>

11:31.120 --> 11:33.588
- <i>everything turns to crap?</i>
- I gave that kid money

11:33.680 --> 11:35.796
and sent him outside.
Now I can't find him.

11:35.880 --> 11:38.075
- I'm sorry, what?
- Kelso said no insurance.

11:38.160 --> 11:40.230
Gotta stabilise the guy then bounce him.

11:40.320 --> 11:42.390
- You gotta be kidding me.
- In ten minutes,

11:42.480 --> 11:45.597
none of this is gonna matter
cos this guy's circling the drain.

11:46.960 --> 11:49.349
Why are you sick?

11:54.200 --> 11:57.510
<i>I can't figure this out.</i>
<i>Maybe if we tried stress-dose steroids.</i>

11:57.600 --> 11:59.750
<i>I'll tell Cox that.</i>
I can't figure this out.

11:59.840 --> 12:02.035
Maybe if we tried
stress-dose steroids...

12:02.120 --> 12:05.556
We can fill a syringe with
false promises and inject him with that.

12:05.640 --> 12:06.709
You got that covered.

12:06.800 --> 12:10.031
Try and discourage me,
cos kites fly highest against wind.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.473
- What?!
- I'm a kite!

12:11.560 --> 12:13.949
I'm a big, beautiful kite. Fly!

12:14.040 --> 12:16.952
I wonder if Mr Milligan
could've received blunt trauma

12:17.040 --> 12:19.190
- without realising it.
- Wrestling.

12:19.280 --> 12:22.397
Remember? He said his kid
dropped him with a power kick.

12:22.480 --> 12:25.119
Kids kick pretty hard.
Maybe he ruptured his spleen.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.633
Get a stat abdominal CT.

12:27.400 --> 12:29.277
Great catch there, Carla.

12:31.440 --> 12:32.998
Thank you.

12:34.440 --> 12:37.318
<i>Think of your best moment in medicine.</i>

12:38.440 --> 12:40.431
You can do this, Dr Turk.

12:41.080 --> 12:42.069
OK!

12:44.880 --> 12:45.915
Time!

12:46.000 --> 12:47.149
Well, it's official.

12:47.240 --> 12:50.073
Dr Turk is now the fastest
appendectomy in the hospital.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.116
In your face, Dr Beardface!

12:52.200 --> 12:54.111
It's Beardfacé!

12:57.320 --> 13:00.756
- What the hell are you doing?
- I got gummed.

13:00.840 --> 13:03.070
Turns out Mr Milligan
has a ruptured spleen.

13:03.160 --> 13:05.310
We're prepping him
for surgery in room "C."

13:05.400 --> 13:07.868
That's the room where
the family gets to observe.

13:07.960 --> 13:09.757
- So?
- You don't understand.

13:09.840 --> 13:12.991
When I operate, I don't see a person,
I see a machine with parts

13:13.080 --> 13:17.312
- and circuits that need replacing.
- You think you're a robot mechanic?

13:17.400 --> 13:20.119
As a surgeon, the more
detached I am, the more focused.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.873
It's pretty impossible
to feel focused or detached

13:22.960 --> 13:25.599
when this guy's family's
watching every move I make!

13:25.680 --> 13:27.113
I wouldn't worry about that.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.839
Mr Milligan only has a son,
and Elliot lost him.

13:29.920 --> 13:31.239
Awesome!

13:32.440 --> 13:34.829
For me. For me.

13:39.080 --> 13:42.436
- Is that fun?
- No, son. It's work.

13:42.520 --> 13:45.034
But this body didn't happen by accident.

13:45.120 --> 13:48.192
Well, you know what I think is fun?
Baseball.

13:48.280 --> 13:51.238
My son is a big baseball fan.

13:51.320 --> 13:53.880
Not so much playing it, but more the...

13:53.960 --> 13:57.032
...designing and sewing of uniforms.

13:57.120 --> 13:58.314
That's neat.

13:58.400 --> 14:01.153
No, it's not.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.390
Maybe we can play catch sometime.

14:04.960 --> 14:06.552
I hope so, young man.

14:08.160 --> 14:09.991
Thank God, Tyler! There you are.

14:10.080 --> 14:12.594
Sorry, Dr Kelso.
This is Mr Milligan's son.

14:12.680 --> 14:14.033
Come on, Tyler.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.873
Thought you were gonna get
Yoo-Hoo and come right back.

14:18.200 --> 14:20.191
- <i>Hi.</i>
- Mabel, this is Bob Kelso.

14:20.280 --> 14:24.319
What say we juggle some things
and see if we can't free ride

14:24.400 --> 14:27.392
Mr Milligan financially for a while, OK?

14:27.480 --> 14:32.190
- <i>Is this really Bob Kelso?</i>
- Yes, this is really Bob Kelso!

14:33.600 --> 14:35.670
Don't run off on me again, Tyler.

14:35.760 --> 14:37.432
Sorry. I got scared.

14:37.520 --> 14:39.351
When I get scared, I hide.

14:39.440 --> 14:42.352
- I know it's stupid.
- It's not stupid.

14:42.440 --> 14:45.193
Wanna know where I used to hide
when I used to get scared?

14:45.280 --> 14:47.748
This closet here.
And the one on the second floor.

14:47.840 --> 14:50.638
There was this broken MRI
machine down in the basement.

14:50.720 --> 14:52.790
It was like my own private cocoon.

14:52.880 --> 14:54.279
You really got scared?

14:54.360 --> 14:56.510
Yeah! Everybody does here at first.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.397
Check this out.

15:00.040 --> 15:01.439
Cool.

15:01.520 --> 15:03.112
Hang in there, Steve.

15:03.200 --> 15:06.033
In school, they never teach you
how to deal with death...

15:06.120 --> 15:08.918
Steve'll be stronger if he
gets through this on his own.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.719
So... How did you stop being scared?

15:13.000 --> 15:15.719
I just realised that people here
need me to be brave.

15:15.800 --> 15:18.712
Just like your dad needs you
to be brave for his operation.

15:18.800 --> 15:20.279
Can I hold his hand?

15:20.360 --> 15:22.476
They're not, actually, very big on that.

15:22.560 --> 15:26.155
- Can I at least watch?
- Are you sure?

15:28.840 --> 15:32.594
- Get it together, Steve!
- I'm trying!

15:36.520 --> 15:38.829
All right. Let's do this!

15:45.120 --> 15:46.758
Come on!

15:48.160 --> 15:51.072
<i>Think of your best moment in medicine.</i>

15:55.880 --> 15:57.472
Come here.
Here you go.

16:02.240 --> 16:04.196
Here you go!

16:06.840 --> 16:08.796
Let's see anybody else make that shot!

16:09.720 --> 16:11.711
Who's your daddy?!

16:11.800 --> 16:14.155
Who's your daddy?
Who's your daddy?

16:15.520 --> 16:17.636
Carla, have you seen Newbie?

16:17.720 --> 16:19.597
Oh, he got off your leash?

16:20.320 --> 16:22.470
Give me a break. The kid's like a...

16:22.560 --> 16:23.959
He's like a...

16:24.600 --> 16:26.591
Have you ever seen a drunk baby?

16:27.120 --> 16:31.716
It's a long story involving my son,
rum cake, and a low counter.

16:31.800 --> 16:33.950
Suffice to say that
it turns out, at first,

16:34.080 --> 16:36.799
it's endearing to watch
them bounce off of the walls,

16:36.880 --> 16:39.440
but man, you take your eyes
off them for one second,

16:39.520 --> 16:40.509
and... Bam!

16:40.600 --> 16:43.717
They got a bucket on their head
and they're ploughing through

16:43.800 --> 16:45.199
your new flat-screen TV.

16:45.280 --> 16:47.794
God save me,
it was barely out of the box.

16:47.880 --> 16:51.555
The point is that
Newbie is my drunk baby.

16:51.640 --> 16:54.154
He figured out that spleen thing.
Get off his case.

16:54.240 --> 16:56.037
I would love to get off his case.

16:56.120 --> 16:58.031
In fact, nothing would make me happier

16:58.120 --> 17:00.270
than to watch him
walk into a patient's room

17:00.360 --> 17:03.636
and not feel that I have to run in
after him and check on everything.

17:03.720 --> 17:06.757
- You wanna know what I think?
- No.

17:06.839 --> 17:09.673
I think you know how good
a doctor J.D. Is, and whether you

17:09.760 --> 17:12.512
admit it or not, you have
a personal stake in his future.

17:12.599 --> 17:15.558
So don't pretend that
all this attention you throw at him

17:15.640 --> 17:17.278
is for him,
cos it's also for you.

17:17.359 --> 17:20.590
As your friend, I'm telling you
that if you want him to keep grow,

17:20.680 --> 17:22.590
you ought to back off once in a while.

17:22.680 --> 17:24.397
- Carla...
- Don't say anything,

17:24.480 --> 17:26.993
cos you know I'm right,
and my jeans do look good.

17:35.440 --> 17:37.431
God, I hate Christmas.

17:37.520 --> 17:39.590
I really do.

17:40.480 --> 17:42.038
Hey, Elliot...

17:42.120 --> 17:43.838
Can I talk to you in private?

17:43.920 --> 17:46.878
<i>Parlez-Vous Français?</i>

17:46.960 --> 17:49.952
I did learn a little when
my high school class went to France,

17:50.040 --> 17:51.837
but that was stuff to pick up chicks.

17:52.720 --> 17:53.709
Turk...

18:07.680 --> 18:09.079
What?

18:11.480 --> 18:12.993
Can I please stay?

18:15.360 --> 18:17.271
Yeah, kid, you can stay.

18:18.720 --> 18:20.073
Dr Turk?

18:20.160 --> 18:21.513
Thanks.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.154
<i>None of us wanted to say</i>
<i>what we were thinking...</i>

18:30.240 --> 18:33.596
<i>How vulnerable we felt. So we all</i>
<i>stood around, pretended to work,</i>

18:33.680 --> 18:36.114
<i>and waited for someone</i>
<i>to come through that door</i>

18:36.200 --> 18:37.952
<i>and tell us how this was gonna end.</i>

18:40.320 --> 18:41.514
Who's the man?

18:43.640 --> 18:45.153
We still got a lotta work to do.

18:45.240 --> 18:47.470
Turk, check the
post-op films in radiology.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.199
Carla, we'll transfuse back
to a haemoglobin of ten.

18:50.280 --> 18:53.192
Elliot, take Tyler and get us all
ice cream immediately?

18:55.640 --> 18:57.756
I'm gonna check on him.
You wanna come?

18:57.840 --> 18:59.831
No. No, you got it.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.754
<i>It's amazing how one patient</i>
<i>can affect so many people.</i>

19:08.920 --> 19:12.037
Dr Dorian, what was your
best moment in medicine?

19:12.120 --> 19:15.999
My best moment.
Well, there was this guy...

19:16.080 --> 19:19.516
He had the most amazing little kid...

19:19.600 --> 19:22.433
And the doctors actually listened to me.

19:24.760 --> 19:27.593
But I knocked the surgery
right out the park.

19:29.520 --> 19:33.274
And I decided to pull
some strings for the guy...

19:33.360 --> 19:35.476
Honest to God,
I wouldn't have believed it

19:35.560 --> 19:38.711
if I hadn't seen it myself,
but Newbie handled the whole thing.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.392
Wire to wire.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.635
<i>And I kept my promise.</i>

19:44.360 --> 19:47.875
<i>Because the two of them</i>
<i>got home in time for Christmas.</i>

19:50.520 --> 19:53.273
And that was my best moment in medicine.
