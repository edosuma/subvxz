00:10.000 --> 00:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

01:27.489 --> 01:28.353
General?

01:29.224 --> 01:30.759
My name is Joven Hernando, sir.

01:30.759 --> 01:31.453
Joven.

01:31.827 --> 01:33.294
The commander's son?

01:34.329 --> 01:36.763
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

01:37.065 --> 01:38.259
Not at all, General.

01:38.667 --> 01:40.769
I am honored to be allowed to interview you.

01:40.769 --> 01:42.430
This is for what again?

01:43.071 --> 01:45.198
We're planning to publish a newsletter.

01:46.274 --> 01:47.476
like what you did with--

01:47.476 --> 01:49.068
La Independencia.

01:50.412 --> 01:51.106
Yes,sir.

01:51.813 --> 01:54.749
We have to continue what you started

01:54.749 --> 01:58.947
It's only fitting that our first article should be about you, General.

02:01.089 --> 02:02.818
You Might end up with a novel, son.

02:05.827 --> 02:06.885
Sit down.

02:13.034 --> 02:14.160
What do you think?

02:15.804 --> 02:18.739
My brother Juan designed this uniform.

02:20.475 --> 02:22.443
l paid for it myseIf.

02:25.213 --> 02:28.740
Our Army has limited funds but...

02:29.618 --> 02:32.951
we must show our enemies
that we have a professional army.

02:37.392 --> 02:38.689
Who sent these?

02:40.362 --> 02:42.664
These are the new uniforms
from General Luna, sir.

02:42.664 --> 02:45.634
What new uniforms?
We already have uniforms!

02:45.634 --> 02:49.035
General Luna came up with a single design
to unify the whole army.

02:49.170 --> 02:50.839
Why do I have to follow
that bastard's order?

02:50.839 --> 02:53.831
The uniforms have President Aguinaldo's
approval, sir.

02:56.177 --> 02:59.806
It's good that our uniforms finally
have one design.

03:01.249 --> 03:04.946
It's a momentous task bringing together
a scattered nation, Joven.

03:06.354 --> 03:10.882
Word is that the Cabinet is about to make a decision
regarding the Americans?

03:14.429 --> 03:17.732
It's easier for the earth to meet the sky

03:17.732 --> 03:20.690
than for two Filipinos to agree on anything!

03:38.447 --> 03:39.846
Mister President!

03:40.382 --> 03:41.781
This arguing is taking us nowhere.

03:42.017 --> 03:45.654
The Americans are gathering
strength as we speak.

03:45.654 --> 03:47.923
Let us attack the now while
they are few in numbers.

03:47.923 --> 03:49.958
Even if we suffer large casuaIties,

03:49.958 --> 03:52.761
we can drive the away
and take control of Manila.

03:52.761 --> 03:54.388
Intramuros will be ours!

03:56.131 --> 03:58.065
We have control over provinces!

03:58.600 --> 04:00.769
We have forty thousand troops!

04:00.769 --> 04:04.439
There are only three thousand Americans,
We can easily drive them away.

04:04.439 --> 04:07.309
I have sent Arguelles and Buencamino

04:07.309 --> 04:10.642
as our Peace Commissioners
to talk with General Otis.

04:12.314 --> 04:14.305
They are toying with us.

04:15.517 --> 04:20.613
My informants tell me they are expecting
7,000 heavily armed troops.

04:23.992 --> 04:25.425
General Luna is right!

04:25.827 --> 04:27.761
We must act now!

04:29.331 --> 04:32.061
America is also an enemy of Spain

04:32.834 --> 04:37.294
and enemies of my enemy my allies shall be.

04:39.441 --> 04:42.501
The Americans fought Spaniards in Cuba.

04:42.811 --> 04:44.546
Did they invade Cuba?

04:44.546 --> 04:45.513
No!

04:45.781 --> 04:49.410
They helped the Cubans kick out the Spanish.

04:50.485 --> 04:52.954
We have no reason to believe they will not
do the same here.

04:52.954 --> 04:56.685
I say give peace between us a chance!

05:00.362 --> 05:01.590
Well said, Señor Paterno.

05:04.065 --> 05:06.329
This has to be a concerned effort, Joven.

05:07.836 --> 05:09.804
Everyone who came before us

05:10.639 --> 05:13.665
gave their lives for Freedom.

05:15.510 --> 05:17.808
If the Americans are targeting Spain,

05:18.046 --> 05:20.173
why haven't they joine us
in our struggle?

05:21.650 --> 05:25.643
Why are they stopping us from
storming Intramuros?

05:30.725 --> 05:33.216
I agree with Señor Paterno.

05:33.595 --> 05:35.831
lopt for peace.

05:35.831 --> 05:36.855
You are blind.

05:38.033 --> 05:40.035
Instead of sitting here all day,

05:40.035 --> 05:42.469
we could be out among our people,
gathering arms,

05:42.604 --> 05:44.105
digging trenches

05:44.105 --> 05:46.801
and training them to fight.

05:47.542 --> 05:51.034
Do not heed the sugar-coated
words of the Americans.

05:51.746 --> 05:54.544
There is no room for naivete
in this Cabinet.

05:59.354 --> 06:01.015
What about our businesses?

06:01.256 --> 06:03.725
If we fight, the economy will be in shambles.

06:03.725 --> 06:06.094
How will we feed our families?

06:06.094 --> 06:08.129
Business or freedom?

06:08.129 --> 06:10.495
Country or family? Choose!

06:14.536 --> 06:15.662
I know you.

06:16.872 --> 06:18.907
You were with the Spanish Civil government

06:18.907 --> 06:21.476
and when things went bad for Spain,
you changed hats.

06:21.476 --> 06:25.845
When things get rough now,
will you start wearing stars and stripes?

06:26.381 --> 06:27.439
Enough.

06:27.983 --> 06:29.678
Everyone here has his interests!

06:30.118 --> 06:31.244
We're only human.

06:31.786 --> 06:34.890
How can anyone talk of business

06:34.890 --> 06:37.158
when we are all slaves in our own country?

06:37.158 --> 06:38.557
I love my country as much as you do.

06:40.929 --> 06:43.359
For now, America is our ally.

06:44.566 --> 06:46.761
They gave me their assurances in Hong Kong.

06:47.435 --> 06:49.604
They are dying to have a foothold in Asia

06:49.604 --> 06:53.301
to compete with other nations
who want to colonize us.

07:02.851 --> 07:07.584
- Let us wait for the Treaty of Paris to be completed--
- Do we have any delegates in Paris?

07:12.928 --> 07:14.953
Any observers, at least?

07:19.534 --> 07:23.300
You're like virgins believing
in the love of a whore!

07:37.652 --> 07:39.779
Tell our countrymen

07:40.188 --> 07:44.454
that Freedom cannot be won by protecting
their loved ones.

07:45.827 --> 07:47.419
They have to pay the price.

07:49.464 --> 07:50.532
What is the price?

07:50.532 --> 07:52.659
Blood and sweat.

07:54.569 --> 07:57.265
They have to jump into the abyss.

07:59.174 --> 08:00.300
MisterPresident,

08:01.343 --> 08:04.278
I apologize for my outburst.

08:07.515 --> 08:10.450
Everyone's suspicions are well-founded.

08:12.053 --> 08:14.283
I say it is best to be patient and wait

08:14.723 --> 08:17.058
but it would also be wise if General Luna

08:17.058 --> 08:18.616
were to strengthen our military forces.

08:19.694 --> 08:20.683
Gentlemen,

08:22.097 --> 08:24.395
let us pray for the best

08:25.500 --> 08:27.695
but prepare for the worst.

10:21.352 --> 10:22.478
Gentlemen...

10:25.589 --> 10:29.025
the Americans fired on our troops
in Sta. Mesa.

10:32.162 --> 10:34.365
They have taken San Juan.

10:34.365 --> 10:35.900
Paco, Pandacan

10:35.900 --> 10:37.629
and other towns.

10:38.068 --> 10:41.629
And they're holding negotiations
with the Spaniards in Intramuros.

10:44.508 --> 10:46.544
Buencamino! Arguelles!

10:46.544 --> 10:48.579
Manila has fallen.

10:48.579 --> 10:50.979
The city is in their hands.

10:59.356 --> 11:00.653
General Luna...

11:01.859 --> 11:02.883
It's up to you now.

11:04.395 --> 11:06.420
This war is in your hands.

11:06.864 --> 11:10.267
What do you want me to do?
Bite them?

11:10.267 --> 11:13.896
Fight with patriots like these?

11:17.274 --> 11:18.502
Lets go!

11:22.947 --> 11:24.715
Buencamino, how did this happen?

11:24.715 --> 11:27.081
What can we do?
We didn't talk to them sooner.

11:39.096 --> 11:42.065
to fight for our country
in the greatest honor.

11:42.833 --> 11:44.767
We should not hesitate.

11:49.106 --> 11:50.903
Forward compatriots.

11:52.009 --> 11:54.569
To conquer or die.

13:33.214 --> 13:35.182
Concentrate your fire!

13:35.616 --> 13:37.174
Do not waste bullets!

13:37.618 --> 13:38.846
Fire!

13:47.228 --> 13:48.429
Aim properly!

13:48.429 --> 13:49.396
Don't waste your bullets.

13:49.630 --> 13:51.265
No retreat!

13:51.265 --> 13:52.964
Fire!

13:54.669 --> 13:55.693
General!

13:59.640 --> 14:01.267
The left flank is in danger!

14:02.643 --> 14:03.371
General!

14:07.748 --> 14:09.951
Send a message to the Kawit Brigade.

14:09.951 --> 14:12.977
Tell Captain Janolino
to reinforce the left flank.

14:13.187 --> 14:14.984
The enemy must not break through.

14:18.926 --> 14:20.086
Dont be afraid!

14:22.763 --> 14:24.298
Fire together.

14:24.298 --> 14:26.095
Don't despair, men!

14:27.702 --> 14:28.634
General,

14:28.836 --> 14:32.169
that would be easier if there were
more of us alive.

14:32.673 --> 14:34.573
TheKawit troops are on their way.

14:35.843 --> 14:37.470
Thatll be the day.

14:42.450 --> 14:44.281
Hey!Where are you going?

14:45.386 --> 14:46.654
Get back here,you cowards!

14:46.654 --> 14:47.348
Hey!

14:48.356 --> 14:50.725
The women here
have bigger balls than you!

14:50.725 --> 14:52.659
Get back here!

14:53.895 --> 14:54.418
You?

14:55.696 --> 14:56.958
Aren't you Buencamino's son?

14:57.899 --> 14:59.196
Stand and fight!

15:01.002 --> 15:01.491
Bullshit!

15:04.805 --> 15:06.136
Son of a bitch!

15:10.978 --> 15:12.536
Keep fighting!

15:12.880 --> 15:14.643
Don't give up!

15:15.149 --> 15:17.879
To the death!

15:21.422 --> 15:22.354
Don't move.

15:22.723 --> 15:23.485
Don't move.
General.

15:27.828 --> 15:29.125
I'm sorry, I cannot...

15:29.230 --> 15:30.288
Be quiet.

15:35.570 --> 15:36.332
Rusca!

15:36.604 --> 15:37.502
Rusca!

15:43.911 --> 15:44.412
Sir?

15:44.412 --> 15:45.470
Get him to the rear.

15:45.746 --> 15:46.713
Call the medic!
Medic!

15:47.048 --> 15:47.912
Medic!

15:50.051 --> 15:50.676
Hurry up!

15:52.720 --> 15:53.709
Get him out of here.

15:59.894 --> 16:00.883
Lieutenant,

16:01.963 --> 16:04.432
for gallantry in the field of battle,

16:04.432 --> 16:06.423
I hereby promote you to Colonel

16:06.801 --> 16:09.565
of the Philippine Republic Army.

16:10.571 --> 16:11.435
General...

16:12.206 --> 16:13.195
Get him out of here.

16:14.275 --> 16:15.242
Thank you, General.

16:23.284 --> 16:24.046
Wait.

16:24.418 --> 16:25.442
Put him down.

16:43.004 --> 16:43.904
What's the news?

16:43.904 --> 16:44.768
Colonel,

16:45.172 --> 16:46.639
Captain Janolino refuses to obey.

16:49.277 --> 16:50.073
General!

16:53.014 --> 16:53.848
What's the word from Kawit?

16:53.848 --> 16:56.517
The Kawit Brigade refuses to obey.

16:56.517 --> 17:00.544
Capt. Janolino says that he has no direct
orders from the President.

17:01.088 --> 17:01.884
Private!

17:03.457 --> 17:04.549
Get my horse.

17:04.858 --> 17:05.883
Rusca stay here.

17:06.093 --> 17:07.617
Hold this line as long as possible!

17:08.695 --> 17:09.992
Were counting on you, brother.

17:14.935 --> 17:15.799
General!

17:25.646 --> 17:27.113
Someone's coming.

17:30.985 --> 17:32.153
Fall in!

17:32.153 --> 17:33.279
Faster!

17:38.526 --> 17:40.494
Look at this sorry bunch of idiots.

17:40.728 --> 17:42.127
Where is Captain Janolino?

17:46.667 --> 17:49.337
Your comrades are dying out there

17:49.337 --> 17:51.635
and you're just playing cards!

17:54.075 --> 17:55.633
Where's your captain?

17:56.143 --> 17:59.670
Stand at attention when the general
is talking to you!

18:03.551 --> 18:04.813
He's inside.

18:06.053 --> 18:07.543
Roman.
General?

18:07.688 --> 18:09.315
Disarm these cowards.

18:10.000 --> 18:10.324
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:10.324 --> 18:11.985
Strip them of their ranks
and tie them up!
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:11.985 --> 18:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:24.338 --> 18:25.327
Son of a  bitch!

18:26.073 --> 18:27.540
Good afternoon,Captain.

18:29.777 --> 18:31.301
Enjoying your nap?

18:32.046 --> 18:32.842
General...

18:34.081 --> 18:37.642
You understand Spanish and Tagalog,
don't you?

18:38.386 --> 18:39.375
Yes,sir.

18:39.954 --> 18:42.081
Well, you piece of shit.

18:43.224 --> 18:45.818
Why did you not obey my orders?

18:51.399 --> 18:52.423
Do you know

18:53.434 --> 18:58.667
how many men are dead and wounded
because of your stupidity?

18:59.206 --> 19:02.733
I... I only take orders
from President Aguinaldo.

19:20.895 --> 19:24.498
Are you not aware of the First Article
of our rules and regulations?

19:24.498 --> 19:26.362
No, sir.

19:26.901 --> 19:28.232
Article One:

19:28.636 --> 19:31.071
Any person who refuses
to follow orders

19:31.071 --> 19:34.108
dictated by the General in chief
of thePhilippineArmy

19:34.108 --> 19:37.236
will be immediately shot without trial.

19:42.116 --> 19:44.107
That means you, brother.

19:51.692 --> 19:55.095
You poor men of Kawit.

19:55.095 --> 19:58.826
Your leader has his brain
in the wrong head.

20:01.268 --> 20:04.635
And by the feel of it,
his brain is not that big.

20:10.010 --> 20:12.308
Back to the field.

20:49.717 --> 20:51.309
Keep em coming!

20:52.186 --> 20:54.054
When you run out of bullets,

20:55.189 --> 20:58.488
come over and I'll smash your
white balls together!

20:59.393 --> 21:01.395
We can't be at them.

21:01.395 --> 21:03.056
Shut up.

21:03.497 --> 21:05.465
Hey! Don't raise your head.

21:06.534 --> 21:07.558
Keep your...

21:08.669 --> 21:10.569
Son of a bitch!

21:14.208 --> 21:15.869
Come back here!

21:17.378 --> 21:18.538
Damn it!

21:19.580 --> 21:20.979
Get back there!

21:21.949 --> 21:23.576
Faster!

21:24.385 --> 21:25.619
Serves you right.

21:25.619 --> 21:27.177
Don't despair,m en!

21:27.721 --> 21:29.390
Stand fast and shoot!

21:29.390 --> 21:30.379
Fire!

21:30.958 --> 21:31.652
Fire!

22:10.731 --> 22:11.459
General!

22:12.399 --> 22:13.229
General!

22:20.140 --> 22:21.038
Don't!

22:24.411 --> 22:26.280
Cover the General!

22:26.280 --> 22:28.578
Charge!

22:29.984 --> 22:31.884
Forward men!

23:00.781 --> 23:01.645
General!

23:04.618 --> 23:06.677
HaIt!
Fire!

23:20.501 --> 23:21.934
Stop, General!

23:41.889 --> 23:43.823
Why did you stop me?

23:44.324 --> 23:45.985
Don't you see I'm...

24:06.413 --> 24:08.949
Hey! You American monkeys!

24:08.949 --> 24:10.211
Get down!

24:17.458 --> 24:18.755
General, look!

24:19.760 --> 24:21.022
For the Motherland.

24:21.762 --> 24:24.754
Charge!
Charge!

24:50.758 --> 24:52.292
They're retreating!

24:52.292 --> 24:53.623
Long live the Philippines!

24:53.794 --> 24:56.763
Long live the Philippines!

24:59.933 --> 25:01.560
This is not a victory, Paco.

25:02.736 --> 25:03.896
I know,General.

25:04.938 --> 25:06.200
But look at them.

25:09.510 --> 25:13.105
They're now a real army
and they need you.

26:40.845 --> 26:43.973
He humiliated my Captain in front
of his men.

26:45.416 --> 26:48.782
You said we should take orders
only from you, Mister President.

26:50.421 --> 26:53.117
We can t afford to lose anyone.

26:58.496 --> 27:00.225
Don't worry, Tomas.

27:03.268 --> 27:05.600
They will all be reinstated.

27:06.304 --> 27:08.169
Thank you, Mister President.

27:09.140 --> 27:11.802
We have to do something about
that crazy Luna.

27:12.544 --> 27:14.512
The Caviteños honor is at stake.

27:52.250 --> 27:54.586
These are my fellow Caviteños.

27:54.586 --> 27:56.754
They fought with me in Kawit.

27:56.754 --> 28:00.058
I agree we need discipline in our ranks
but the way he carries it out.

28:00.058 --> 28:04.154
The humiliation.
ThefactisLunais still useful.

28:05.096 --> 28:06.529
I cant figure him out.

28:08.166 --> 28:09.724
What do we do with him?

28:10.201 --> 28:11.190
Support him.

28:11.769 --> 28:13.896
We still share the same goals.

28:14.172 --> 28:15.833
Is there anything we can do?

28:16.841 --> 28:18.638
But his arrogance.

28:20.745 --> 28:23.578
Have you ever tried
to catch the wind?

28:25.683 --> 28:30.211
They say that you area war monger.

28:30.955 --> 28:33.591
Why not compromise?

28:33.591 --> 28:35.821
Would it not be easier?

28:37.395 --> 28:40.057
I detest war, Joven.

28:41.899 --> 28:43.560
But compromise?

28:45.703 --> 28:48.035
Can we simply ignore the enemy?

28:50.682 --> 28:53.583
The Americans are not going
to stop soon.

28:54.519 --> 28:57.113
Our forces will eventually run out.

28:58.190 --> 29:02.160
That s why we have to prepare
our last stand.

29:02.160 --> 29:04.462
The planis sound,General.

29:04.462 --> 29:08.834
These trenches were planning to dig
north of Bagbag river will hold up.

29:08.834 --> 29:13.471
But the trenches from Caloocan
to Novaliches are more important.

29:13.471 --> 29:17.339
While the Americans are busy fighting,
we will retreat North.

29:17.776 --> 29:18.877
General.

29:18.877 --> 29:19.935
Yes?

29:20.712 --> 29:25.050
First, we Do not have enough men
to dig a trench line that long.

29:25.050 --> 29:27.953
We need at least 2,000 volunteers

29:27.953 --> 29:31.320
with shovel sand pickaxes to start with.

29:32.157 --> 29:36.328
Second, I do not think the President
will agree to such an ambitious plan

29:36.328 --> 29:40.424
especially the trench line
from Caloocan to Novaliches.

29:49.875 --> 29:51.209
Three days.

29:51.209 --> 29:52.267
Sir?

29:52.677 --> 29:54.668
Give me three days.

29:58.683 --> 29:59.818
Major.

29:59.818 --> 30:00.842
Captain.

30:05.824 --> 30:09.761
The Americans know why we have
to fight for our liberty.

30:09.761 --> 30:13.527
They fought ferociously for theirs.

30:14.833 --> 30:17.028
Are we different from them?

30:17.535 --> 30:21.198
So wen ot have
the same right to Liberty?

30:22.540 --> 30:26.611
That is what makes their aggression
toward us inexcusable.

30:26.611 --> 30:28.169
Fall in!

30:30.448 --> 30:31.881
Article One:

30:33.218 --> 30:36.388
any person who refuses
to follow orders

30:36.388 --> 30:40.091
dictated by the General in chief
of the PhilippineArmy

30:40.091 --> 30:43.083
will be shot without trial.

31:03.982 --> 31:05.415
Ready?

31:06.384 --> 31:07.886
I'm sorry, General.

31:07.886 --> 31:10.889
Are we going home?
We have three more camps to visit.

31:10.889 --> 31:12.457
With all due respect, sir.
It's midnight.

31:12.457 --> 31:14.448
Then ride fast, my brother.

31:43.955 --> 31:45.149
General.

31:49.160 --> 31:49.956
General.

31:51.763 --> 31:52.831
Good morning, Paco.

31:52.831 --> 31:54.958
You look like you came from battle.

31:56.935 --> 31:57.629
Breakfast?

31:57.869 --> 31:59.496
Yes. Theres breakfast ready.

32:00.038 --> 32:01.164
Not for me.

32:02.707 --> 32:04.106
For them.

32:09.547 --> 32:11.014
Two thousand?

32:11.549 --> 32:12.675
Four.

32:13.118 --> 32:14.517
Four?

32:33.371 --> 32:34.599
HaIt!

32:35.373 --> 32:36.431
Captain.

32:38.376 --> 32:39.673
Thank you for offering to help.

32:41.246 --> 32:43.111
We had no choice.

32:44.049 --> 32:46.184
He threatened to shoot us all

32:46.184 --> 32:47.879
if we didn't come with him.

32:48.987 --> 32:50.477
Some of the men
have begunc alling him

32:51.056 --> 32:52.683
General ArticleOne.

33:12.577 --> 33:15.978
General, we need to send men
and ammunition to Bataan.

33:16.514 --> 33:19.717
I have three reserve platoons
in Bulacan.

33:19.717 --> 33:21.419
They can ride tomorrow.

33:21.419 --> 33:25.048
With all due respect, they need
to reach Bataan before Sunday.

33:25.723 --> 33:28.191
My men cannot fly, Paco.

33:30.228 --> 33:31.729
Take command of the camp,General.

33:31.729 --> 33:33.196
What are you going to do?

33:33.765 --> 33:35.198
I will get us a train.

33:55.653 --> 33:56.517
General,

33:56.921 --> 33:58.786
do you know how to speakEnglish?

34:06.231 --> 34:07.789
[Speaking in French]

34:25.283 --> 34:26.773
There! Over there!

35:00.618 --> 35:02.142
He says you're crazy.

35:31.416 --> 35:32.883
My English is running out.

35:33.117 --> 35:34.675
Arrest him already!
Damn it!

35:36.588 --> 35:37.486
Quickly!

35:38.423 --> 35:40.448
Damn your foreign tongue!

35:53.238 --> 35:55.798
This tea would go better
with ensaymada.

35:57.909 --> 35:58.967
General.

35:59.577 --> 36:00.976
ls everything ready?

36:02.013 --> 36:03.915
Ah... we have a problem.

36:03.915 --> 36:05.507
The Americans?

36:06.050 --> 36:06.744
No, sir.

36:06.951 --> 36:08.578
Our officers.

36:09.387 --> 36:12.322
They invited their families on
the train for sightseeing.

36:12.790 --> 36:15.020
There is no room for the troops to board.

36:15.593 --> 36:17.652
Damn it!

36:24.936 --> 36:26.927
You should try ensaymada with that.

36:39.117 --> 36:40.049
Out of my way!

36:40.618 --> 36:41.607
Out of my way!

36:46.291 --> 36:47.758
ldiots!

36:48.126 --> 36:49.388
We are not going sightseeing!

36:49.994 --> 36:51.623
Out!

37:03.741 --> 37:06.574
That was a big headache.

37:09.580 --> 37:10.000
That's just Filipinos being Filipinos.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.605
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!
That's just Filipinos being Filipinos.

37:11.605 --> 37:12.684
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:12.684 --> 37:14.413
Family comes first.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:14.413 --> 37:16.454
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:16.454 --> 37:18.319
And that's our biggest fauIt.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:18.319 --> 37:20.825
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:20.825 --> 37:22.000
We risk our lives for our
families and neighbour's
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:22.000 --> 37:23.555
We risk our lives for our
families and neighbour's

37:24.595 --> 37:26.790
but for the idea of nationhood?

37:45.216 --> 37:48.777
I can count with my fingers
the true patriotic soldiers I've met in my life.

37:52.028 --> 37:54.131
I remember one skirmish in Malabon.

37:54.131 --> 37:56.233
The fighting had stopped

37:56.233 --> 37:58.098
around dinner time.

38:00.971 --> 38:05.067
There wasanAmerican colonel who was having
dinner inside an abandoned house.

38:23.894 --> 38:26.454
Lets see who has balls
amongst our infantry.

38:31.101 --> 38:31.965
Now,

38:32.736 --> 38:36.035
I'm giving you a chance to prove
your worth to this army.

38:36.773 --> 38:38.638
Who wants to harass the Americans?

38:40.677 --> 38:42.269
They're all having dinner.

38:43.680 --> 38:44.806
There is a colonel

38:45.615 --> 38:48.151
inside a house
in the western side of town

38:48.151 --> 38:50.210
who is a sitting duck
at this very moment.

38:50.454 --> 38:52.388
Who wants to take a shot?

38:59.963 --> 39:01.794
Do we have no patriots here?

39:08.505 --> 39:12.498
Is there no one willing
to die for this nation?

39:19.683 --> 39:20.672
Name?

39:21.151 --> 39:22.516
Garcia, General.

39:28.692 --> 39:31.752
Lieutenant Garcia
is a rare breed amongst men,

39:33.363 --> 39:37.094
the kind who's willing to give
everything for his country.

40:34.424 --> 40:37.294
Why doesn't he just shoot
the American?

40:37.294 --> 40:41.060
It's enough for them to know
that we are not afraid of them.

40:49.940 --> 40:50.838
Long live the Philippines!

40:50.974 --> 40:53.033
Long live the Philippines!

40:53.243 --> 40:55.245
Put Garcia in
the First Battalion Sharpshooters.

40:55.245 --> 40:56.269
He's qualified.

40:56.913 --> 40:57.880
Long live the General!

40:58.748 --> 41:00.409
Long live the Philippines!

41:02.419 --> 41:04.546
If only every Filipino was like him.

41:06.756 --> 41:08.587
There are many like him.

41:09.993 --> 41:11.893
Not enough, Joven.

41:14.764 --> 41:16.254
Come in.

41:18.101 --> 41:18.897
General,

41:21.304 --> 41:22.362
it's time.

41:26.610 --> 41:28.945
Joven, let's continue this tomorrow.

41:28.945 --> 41:30.378
Thank you, General.

41:57.040 --> 42:02.740
We had to arrest a few
drunken ruffians in town last night.

42:05.181 --> 42:07.741
One of them was your brother.

42:08.351 --> 42:09.079
Who?

42:09.319 --> 42:10.720
Joaquin, sir.

42:10.720 --> 42:12.449
Fighting over a woman, I bet.

42:14.024 --> 42:15.821
Mark of a true Luna.

42:20.697 --> 42:25.100
You know, Dr. Rizal and l
almost got into a duel because of a woman.

42:26.069 --> 42:28.629
Sol heard from Paco.

42:28.972 --> 42:30.667
Is my brother in jail?

42:30.874 --> 42:33.143
Yes, sir. He kept screaming
that he was your brother.

42:33.143 --> 42:34.610
Leave him there.

42:47.657 --> 42:49.784
Be careful, General.

42:50.827 --> 42:52.886
This is going to be tough.

42:56.166 --> 42:57.133
I know.

43:28.763 --> 43:30.060
What took you so long?

43:36.471 --> 43:37.938
I hope you were discreet.

43:48.316 --> 43:49.783
I was.

43:53.688 --> 43:54.882
Don't laugh.

43:56.791 --> 43:58.554
I have more to lose.

44:00.461 --> 44:02.929
lama woman of marrying age.

44:07.468 --> 44:09.629
And from a prominent family,

44:14.375 --> 44:16.070
in love with an Indio.

44:17.812 --> 44:20.781
You are not a poor man.
Your family is rich.

44:24.018 --> 44:25.280
But I'm right

44:27.555 --> 44:28.681
that you love me?

44:42.036 --> 44:43.503
Bastard.

44:49.711 --> 44:51.804
I'm thirsty.

45:13.001 --> 45:15.401
Am I not enough
to satisfy your thirst?

45:31.719 --> 45:33.209
My god. What happened?

45:34.622 --> 45:35.554
Work.

45:37.725 --> 45:38.919
Were you shot?

45:42.730 --> 45:46.401
Why is it that after making love,
you start acting like my mother?

45:46.401 --> 45:48.926
You got shot, didn't you?

45:50.038 --> 45:51.164
Just a scratch.

45:51.439 --> 45:53.202
You liar.This is not a scratch.

45:56.477 --> 46:00.709
Now you sound like a nagging wife.

46:05.219 --> 46:06.117
Antonio,

46:08.256 --> 46:09.621
you're married to war.

46:10.058 --> 46:11.184
I'm just a mistress.

46:14.095 --> 46:14.754
Hey,

46:15.296 --> 46:16.164
it's cold.

46:16.164 --> 46:17.426
Go to hell.

46:19.967 --> 46:22.435
I'm in hell everyday

46:23.638 --> 46:25.196
when I'm not with you.

46:26.407 --> 46:28.102
Lying again.

46:34.482 --> 46:35.710
You think

46:37.285 --> 46:39.446
I enjoy fighting?

46:40.655 --> 46:42.782
Yes, because you are a sadist.

46:48.196 --> 46:50.289
War is not my wife,

46:53.601 --> 46:54.932
it is the cross I bear.

47:07.381 --> 47:10.612
Is this really our last night together?

47:14.355 --> 47:15.151
Isabel.

47:17.725 --> 47:20.319
We can't keep seeing each
other again like this,

47:21.195 --> 47:22.184
correct?

47:27.568 --> 47:28.193
Correct.

47:35.042 --> 47:39.206
We Do not have time for things
we cannot sustain.

47:48.089 --> 47:50.491
Our duties in this war
are more important

47:50.491 --> 47:53.358
than our feelings for each other.

47:57.098 --> 47:59.123
The next time we meet,

48:01.068 --> 48:02.831
you are a soldier

48:05.339 --> 48:06.363
and I...

48:08.576 --> 48:10.635
a woman of the Red Cross.

48:19.020 --> 48:20.044
Isabel.

48:20.354 --> 48:21.321
General.

48:33.172 --> 48:34.867
Mister President.

48:35.675 --> 48:40.346
Mister President, the Schurman Commission
wants to meet with us

48:40.346 --> 48:41.848
to discuss some terms.

48:41.848 --> 48:43.249
Terms?

48:43.249 --> 48:44.450
There are no terms!

48:44.450 --> 48:45.585
What do you mean, no terms?

48:45.585 --> 48:46.711
Wait.

48:49.989 --> 48:52.389
Quiet! Let him speak!

48:53.326 --> 48:58.127
They are offering some kind
of autonomy for the Republic.

48:58.331 --> 48:59.932
To be a protectorate...

48:59.932 --> 49:01.601
under America.

49:01.601 --> 49:03.269
That would bet reason!

49:03.269 --> 49:04.370
Treason!

49:04.370 --> 49:05.938
According to our constitution,

49:05.938 --> 49:08.839
sovereignty rests only
with the Filipino People.

49:09.976 --> 49:12.308
You are a traitor
for proposing annexation.

49:12.879 --> 49:14.574
I am not proposing it.

49:15.047 --> 49:16.446
I am merely reporting it.

49:17.149 --> 49:19.583
How can you trust him?

49:20.720 --> 49:22.813
He worked for the Spanish government.

49:23.689 --> 49:27.352
With people like these,
we don't need enemies.

49:29.362 --> 49:30.454
America...

49:30.563 --> 49:33.862
is the strongest nation in the world.

49:34.667 --> 49:39.161
Think of the advantages
for trade and economy.

49:39.372 --> 49:41.636
How long are we going to keep fighting?

49:42.074 --> 49:43.769
Our casuaIties are mounting.

49:44.310 --> 49:46.245
We are short on money,

49:46.245 --> 49:47.980
arms and ammunition.

49:47.980 --> 49:49.470
But not inspirit.

49:49.916 --> 49:51.850
My men are committed.

49:53.052 --> 49:54.220
Even Sr. Jose Rizal...

49:54.220 --> 49:58.054
How can this Assembly consider
something this treasonous?

50:01.894 --> 50:03.429
Are you calling me a traitor?

50:03.429 --> 50:05.192
And a coward.

50:08.434 --> 50:10.902
I remember I saw your son in battle.

50:12.071 --> 50:15.234
He deserted his post while
his comrade slay dying.

50:19.078 --> 50:20.841
There are no cowards in my family.

50:23.015 --> 50:26.849
My son never joined you in battle

50:27.753 --> 50:31.189
so you have no right to insuIt
my family, Antonio.

50:33.693 --> 50:35.684
Was I insuIting you?

50:37.630 --> 50:39.732
I was merely stating the fact

50:39.732 --> 50:41.996
that cowardice and treason
are in your blood.

50:46.906 --> 50:48.771
You really are like your brother.

50:49.809 --> 50:51.811
If Juan had been tried
in this country

50:51.811 --> 50:55.114
for the murder of his wife,
he would've been hanged.

50:55.114 --> 50:57.105
You are true to your name:

50:57.950 --> 50:58.848
Luna...

50:59.418 --> 51:00.851
Lunatic!

51:03.823 --> 51:04.687
Enough!

51:09.095 --> 51:09.929
Calm down.

51:09.929 --> 51:10.630
Calm down!

51:10.630 --> 51:11.722
That's enough!

51:16.102 --> 51:19.905
By the authority granted to me
by the Philippine Republic,

51:19.905 --> 51:22.237
I order the arrest of this traitor.

51:23.643 --> 51:24.940
And you too.

51:27.647 --> 51:28.875
Why me?

51:34.253 --> 51:35.777
It is within his rights.

51:37.123 --> 51:38.317
Captain, Major,

51:38.624 --> 51:40.057
arrest Buencamino.

51:40.326 --> 51:41.623
Colonel, Roman.

51:42.762 --> 51:43.629
Assist me.

51:43.629 --> 51:45.597
lam not a traitor!

51:47.166 --> 51:49.135
This is unconstitutional!

51:49.135 --> 51:50.124
Just come with me

51:50.670 --> 51:52.160
and shut up!

51:57.009 --> 52:01.002
If we are to become oneNation,
we must go through a radical change.

52:01.714 --> 52:02.615
Brothers,

52:02.615 --> 52:05.743
we have an enemy
bigger than the Americans:

52:07.319 --> 52:09.014
Ourselves.

52:25.935 --> 52:28.335
Fresh fruits and vegetables!

52:41.917 --> 52:42.679
Sir.

52:57.433 --> 52:58.798
Stop right there!

53:05.274 --> 53:05.968
Me?

53:07.142 --> 53:07.938
Don't move.

53:09.578 --> 53:10.374
General,

53:10.746 --> 53:12.270
do you want to buy a chicken?

53:13.816 --> 53:14.942
I said don't move.

53:16.652 --> 53:18.882
Do as he says,old man.

53:19.688 --> 53:22.657
Sir,what have I done?

53:22.958 --> 53:24.255
Just keep quiet.

53:25.361 --> 53:28.264
l ll give you haIf price
for the chickens.

53:28.264 --> 53:30.129
Tell him to shut up.

53:34.603 --> 53:36.833
Okay. I'll give them for free...

53:42.845 --> 53:46.246
That's what I'll do to traitors.
I will not hesitate.

53:49.351 --> 53:51.080
No one is above the Law.

53:51.987 --> 53:53.477
Not even the President.

53:54.823 --> 53:56.392
General, people might hear you.

53:56.392 --> 53:57.825
Let them hear!

54:04.567 --> 54:06.068
Have mercy, sir.

54:06.068 --> 54:07.903
Please Don't hurt me.

54:07.903 --> 54:09.165
Please.

54:10.906 --> 54:11.873
There, there.

54:14.143 --> 54:15.132
I apologize.

54:16.178 --> 54:17.270
For your troubles.

54:19.181 --> 54:19.982
Thank you.

54:19.982 --> 54:21.711
Have the chicken for dinner.

54:23.252 --> 54:24.920
Thank you so much.

54:24.920 --> 54:26.444
Thank you!

54:34.763 --> 54:36.731
The true sons of liberty

54:37.600 --> 54:41.297
will never allow themselves
to be tied up like dogs.

54:47.509 --> 54:53.038
Those who place their petty seIf interests
above the country's...

54:58.087 --> 55:02.751
who pledge allegiance to their regions,
loyaIty only to their tribes...

55:08.030 --> 55:09.725
It is them who prove us

55:10.299 --> 55:13.200
undeserving of seIf rule.

55:51.456 --> 55:53.390
How many more troops have arrived?

55:54.492 --> 55:55.927
About a thousand and a haIf,

55:55.927 --> 55:57.952
from Pangasinan and Ilocos.

55:59.297 --> 56:03.165
It. Manuel Quezon brought us
about four hundred men from Tayabas.

56:04.369 --> 56:05.470
Everyone goes to you,

56:05.470 --> 56:07.461
now that the Bonifacio brothers
are out of the way.

56:08.773 --> 56:10.104
Procopio!

56:14.946 --> 56:16.140
If there's nothing else,
I will go ahead.

56:16.781 --> 56:18.009
Where are you going?

56:18.483 --> 56:19.643
To Arayat.

56:20.185 --> 56:21.812
There's a fiesta I have to attend.

56:30.695 --> 56:33.425
Still thinking about AndresBonifacio?

56:39.304 --> 56:41.772
I'm just afraid
it might happen again.

56:46.811 --> 56:48.938
Our defenses are up for the three camps,

56:49.581 --> 56:50.980
herein Bagbag,

56:53.051 --> 56:54.109
Pulilan

56:56.187 --> 56:57.950
and with General del Pilars troops

56:58.056 --> 56:59.023
in Quinga.

56:59.524 --> 57:02.049
But we still need more troops.

57:06.030 --> 57:08.055
Send a telegram to General Mascardo.

57:08.400 --> 57:09.458
Tell him

57:09.901 --> 57:10.000
to send more troops

57:10.000 --> 57:11.835
You're Watching 123Movies.to
to send more troops

57:11.835 --> 57:12.103
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:12.103 --> 57:14.503
to Quinga and here in Bagbag.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:14.503 --> 57:15.540
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:15.540 --> 57:16.507
Sir,
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:16.507 --> 57:17.342
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:17.342 --> 57:19.469
General Mascardo is headed for Arayat.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:19.469 --> 57:20.078
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:20.078 --> 57:20.703
What for?
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:20.703 --> 57:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:22.380 --> 57:23.715
He did not say.

57:23.715 --> 57:25.740
But there's a fiesta today in Arayat.

57:31.756 --> 57:32.916
General Mascardo,

57:34.125 --> 57:35.854
a telegram fromGeneral Luna.

57:36.194 --> 57:37.028
What does it say?

57:37.028 --> 57:39.431
He s ordering you to return
to Bagbag immediately

57:39.431 --> 57:41.331
with additional troops.

57:41.766 --> 57:43.825
I just got here
and he wants me to leave?

57:44.736 --> 57:47.170
He also said
there's no time for festivities.

57:48.907 --> 57:50.775
Look at that Luna's arrogance.

57:50.775 --> 57:53.539
You'd think he wasn't talking
to a fellow General.

57:54.479 --> 57:55.580
Tell him

57:55.580 --> 57:57.282
I didn't come for the fiesta.

57:57.282 --> 58:00.012
II have to inspect our troops here.

58:00.418 --> 58:02.943
I will go toBagbagwhen I'm done.

58:03.988 --> 58:05.590
While the Americans advance,

58:05.590 --> 58:07.759
our troops will slowly retreat

58:07.759 --> 58:11.195
to a fortress up North
in the Cordillera mountains.

58:11.663 --> 58:13.927
By the time the Americans reach us,

58:15.066 --> 58:16.533
our defenses would have been fortified.

58:17.101 --> 58:19.170
If we cant surpass the enemy

58:19.170 --> 58:21.673
in numbers and technology,

58:21.673 --> 58:24.540
we will beat them with strategy.

58:24.776 --> 58:29.042
We need to dig trenches
from CaloocantoNovaliches.

58:29.814 --> 58:31.145
From Arayat, sir.

58:31.749 --> 58:34.980
Were just waiting
for the President's approval.

58:37.288 --> 58:38.482
This is going to be a big mess.

58:39.190 --> 58:40.425
I hope he approves it.

58:40.425 --> 58:41.323
He must.

58:43.428 --> 58:44.087
General.

58:49.968 --> 58:52.562
Kindly ask Mascardo
if he understands Tagalog.

58:53.137 --> 58:57.141
Or do you understand Spanish more?
Because your orders were clear...

58:57.141 --> 58:58.733
I understand Tagalog!

58:59.010 --> 59:00.602
I will go to Bagbag when I'm done here!

59:00.945 --> 59:05.316
Tell him he doesn't have authority over me
because I'm the commander of Pampanga.

59:05.316 --> 59:08.553
The President gave him
authority over the troops...

59:08.553 --> 59:11.147
...but not over Generals like him.

59:11.890 --> 59:12.948
Is that so?

59:14.058 --> 59:15.025
Rusca!

59:24.736 --> 59:25.998
Ride to Arayat

59:26.638 --> 59:28.973
and tell to Mascardos face
that I will...

59:28.973 --> 59:31.032
...have you arrested for stubbornness.

59:31.476 --> 59:33.044
Is that a threat?

59:33.044 --> 59:36.047
General, Id just like to remind you that
what's important is you return to Bagbag

59:36.047 --> 59:39.210
with reinforcements
before the Americans attack.

59:39.551 --> 59:42.887
I was about to leave but that Lunas
arrogance is intolerable.

59:42.887 --> 59:44.320
Who is he to give me orders?

59:44.556 --> 59:46.023
If he wants a fight I'm not backing down!

59:50.395 --> 59:50.952
Roman,

59:53.164 --> 59:57.735
send a telegram to every official
under Mascardo and tell them

59:57.735 --> 01:00:01.205
they are to report to the main headquarters
in Pampanga tonight.

01:00:01.205 --> 01:00:05.043
They are all under my command
so they cannot disobey.

01:00:05.043 --> 01:00:05.873
Rusca,

01:00:06.344 --> 01:00:09.414
inform President Aguinaldo that...

01:00:09.414 --> 01:00:14.317
...General Luna plans to haveGeneraI'mascardo
arrested if this continues.

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:16.583
This is bad.

01:00:17.121 --> 01:00:20.625
The Americans will think there's
confusion amongst our ranks.

01:00:20.625 --> 01:00:22.354
Well it's true, is it not?

01:00:27.699 --> 01:00:28.688
Damn it!

01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:31.530
If that brute is looking for a fight,

01:00:31.703 --> 01:00:33.371
I will give it to him.

01:00:33.371 --> 01:00:34.167
Move!

01:00:34.806 --> 01:00:35.864
Stop the music!

01:00:36.107 --> 01:00:37.165
Soldiers!

01:00:38.409 --> 01:00:40.206
Do not follow Lunas orders.

01:00:40.645 --> 01:00:41.669
Arm yourselves!

01:00:43.381 --> 01:00:44.439
What are you waiting for?

01:00:48.453 --> 01:00:50.182
Get Captain Janolino.

01:00:50.488 --> 01:00:53.424
Tell him to gather
the soldiers headed for Bagbag

01:00:53.424 --> 01:00:54.789
and have them report to me.

01:00:55.226 --> 01:00:56.761
Tell Luna that...

01:00:56.761 --> 01:00:59.330
...he would rather lie in a coffin
than obey orders from you.

01:00:59.330 --> 01:01:01.958
He only listenstothePresident
or fellow Caviteños.

01:01:02.433 --> 01:01:05.470
Does that idiot think Cavite
is a different country?

01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:08.606
He's gathered his troops and officers.
They're heading to Guagua.

01:01:08.606 --> 01:01:10.074
What is he going to do in Guagua?

01:01:10.074 --> 01:01:12.474
If you want to face him,
hell wait for you there.

01:01:16.781 --> 01:01:18.214
How many men do we have now?

01:01:18.516 --> 01:01:20.211
The Bernal brothers are here.

01:01:20.685 --> 01:01:21.319
Captain.

01:01:21.319 --> 01:01:22.186
Major.

01:01:22.186 --> 01:01:23.488
Do not worry, General.

01:01:23.488 --> 01:01:24.785
We are behind you.

01:01:25.657 --> 01:01:27.818
There are some men
stationed at the bridge.

01:01:28.126 --> 01:01:29.627
Captain Rusca hasn't returned yet.

01:01:29.627 --> 01:01:30.321
Jose?

01:01:30.995 --> 01:01:32.664
Stay here with a few lieutenants

01:01:32.664 --> 01:01:33.698
to over see the bridge defenses.

01:01:33.698 --> 01:01:35.893
Everyone else come with me to Guagua.

01:01:36.601 --> 01:01:38.469
Send a telegram to Alejandrino.

01:01:38.469 --> 01:01:41.105
I need the First Battalion Sharpshooters
inGuagua.

01:01:41.105 --> 01:01:42.129
Yes,sir.

01:01:46.210 --> 01:01:47.802
And let's bring a coffin.

01:02:14.472 --> 01:02:16.838
There's trouble in Guagua.

01:02:17.341 --> 01:02:21.505
GeneraI'mascardo has armed his troops
and is waiting forGeneral Luna.

01:02:23.648 --> 01:02:25.309
You need to send orders.

01:02:35.259 --> 01:02:36.123
General Luna,

01:02:37.829 --> 01:02:40.957
we apologize in behaIf of
General Mascardo.

01:02:41.365 --> 01:02:42.533
Women of the RedCross.

01:02:42.533 --> 01:02:43.401
I know.

01:02:47.405 --> 01:02:48.201
General,

01:02:48.506 --> 01:02:52.009
weDo not want fighting
amongst fellow Filipinos.

01:02:52.009 --> 01:02:55.035
She has a point,General.
I did not ask for this, Major.

01:02:55.513 --> 01:02:55.877
Is a...

01:02:58.616 --> 01:02:59.344
Miss...

01:02:59.617 --> 01:03:00.413
General.

01:03:00.685 --> 01:03:06.190
Tell Mascardo I'm giving him one more chance
to surrender peacefully.

01:03:06.190 --> 01:03:07.817
It's all in his hands.

01:03:19.804 --> 01:03:22.034
I understand, ladies,

01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:23.907
but it's too late.

01:03:24.542 --> 01:03:26.077
I will only surrender to the President,

01:03:26.077 --> 01:03:27.738
not to someone like Luna.

01:03:28.212 --> 01:03:29.873
What are you really fighting over?

01:03:31.616 --> 01:03:32.412
Isabel.

01:03:33.084 --> 01:03:34.676
To hell with you two, Tomas.

01:03:35.052 --> 01:03:36.246
You reacting like children.

01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:50.130
General.

01:03:51.903 --> 01:03:52.631
Paco.

01:03:53.471 --> 01:03:54.438
What is it, sir?

01:03:55.573 --> 01:03:57.700
Send a telegram toBagbag.

01:03:59.310 --> 01:04:00.607
Find out their situation.

01:04:01.078 --> 01:04:02.204
Do you have orders?

01:04:04.315 --> 01:04:05.612
Just find out how they are.

01:04:53.404 --> 01:04:54.530
The Americans are here!

01:05:00.378 --> 01:05:01.310
Americans.

01:05:02.347 --> 01:05:04.048
The Americans are here!

01:05:16.261 --> 01:05:16.955
Go ahead,

01:05:17.996 --> 01:05:18.963
shoot me.

01:05:20.732 --> 01:05:21.562
I'm here.

01:05:22.901 --> 01:05:23.868
Shoot me!

01:05:25.069 --> 01:05:25.899
Now!

01:05:28.406 --> 01:05:30.033
General Tomas Mascardo,

01:05:31.075 --> 01:05:33.066
I'm hereto arrest you

01:05:34.112 --> 01:05:37.172
inthenameofthePhilippineRepublic.

01:05:37.882 --> 01:05:39.008
Show yourseIf.

01:05:58.870 --> 01:06:00.705
Good evening, General.

01:06:00.705 --> 01:06:01.933
Good evening to you too.

01:06:03.808 --> 01:06:06.174
I trust that you
will surrender peacefully?

01:06:07.412 --> 01:06:08.344
I told you

01:06:08.913 --> 01:06:11.905
I would rather lie in a coffin.

01:06:27.565 --> 01:06:28.896
You are insane, Luna.

01:06:29.133 --> 01:06:30.725
I'm only heeding your request.

01:06:31.269 --> 01:06:33.137
You are surrounded by my troops.

01:06:33.137 --> 01:06:34.297
How many men do you have?

01:06:35.106 --> 01:06:35.800
Fifteen?

01:06:36.507 --> 01:06:37.439
Twenty?

01:06:38.509 --> 01:06:39.271
Tomas,

01:06:40.511 --> 01:06:42.680
I only need to shoot you

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:44.580
and you're standing
right in front of me.

01:06:48.853 --> 01:06:49.785
Easy.

01:06:54.525 --> 01:06:56.390
Think about this.

01:06:59.364 --> 01:07:00.592
You all know what to do.

01:07:04.302 --> 01:07:05.826
We out number them

01:07:10.675 --> 01:07:12.836
First Battalion Sharp shooters
at your command.

01:07:23.488 --> 01:07:24.284
So?

01:07:31.863 --> 01:07:32.897
You son of a bitch.

01:07:32.897 --> 01:07:33.795
Wait!

01:07:36.034 --> 01:07:36.864
Wait.

01:07:49.881 --> 01:07:51.212
GeneraI'mascardo,

01:07:52.183 --> 01:07:54.276
under orders from
President Emilio Aguinaldo

01:08:10.034 --> 01:08:11.058
Thank you,Tomas.

01:08:23.413 --> 01:08:24.471
Justin time, Rusca.

01:08:26.117 --> 01:08:26.845
General,

01:08:27.551 --> 01:08:29.712
I ran into Paco.
There's terrible news.

01:08:30.188 --> 01:08:32.557
The Americans have attacked
Bagbag and Quinga.

01:08:32.557 --> 01:08:34.388
Both camps are in grave danger.

01:08:50.907 --> 01:08:51.532
Joven!

01:08:52.309 --> 01:08:52.809
Overhere.

01:09:19.502 --> 01:09:21.562
God dammit, where are there inforcements?

01:09:36.486 --> 01:09:36.917
Don't!

01:09:57.641 --> 01:09:58.198
Joven!

01:10:00.644 --> 01:10:01.269
Joven!

01:10:01.711 --> 01:10:02.746
Where are you going?

01:10:02.746 --> 01:10:03.713
Stay put!

01:10:28.872 --> 01:10:29.839
Forward!

01:10:37.113 --> 01:10:38.205
Guard the entrance!

01:10:42.285 --> 01:10:43.377
Where are the rest?

01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:46.750
They went to Quinga to help General Del Pilar.

01:10:54.397 --> 01:10:55.193
Joven.

01:10:55.966 --> 01:10:56.933
General.

01:10:56.933 --> 01:10:58.195
Can you move?

01:11:02.105 --> 01:11:03.538
Medic! Overhere!

01:11:22.092 --> 01:11:22.751
General!

01:11:23.093 --> 01:11:24.355
General, we're ready.

01:12:02.132 --> 01:12:04.327
The Americans have taken Quinga.

01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:09.503
General del Pilar has retreated
with his men to San Fernando.

01:12:20.116 --> 01:12:22.607
Is this our fate?

01:12:24.621 --> 01:12:26.486
We fight with our enemies.

01:12:28.224 --> 01:12:30.283
We fight with our allies.

01:12:35.332 --> 01:12:36.856
I'm tired.

01:12:55.719 --> 01:12:58.620
Luna has not been able
to stop the enemy's advance.

01:13:00.156 --> 01:13:04.490
We should ask for a cease fire
so we can talk with the Americans.

01:13:06.135 --> 01:13:08.933
Granted we are at a disadvantage.

01:13:11.107 --> 01:13:13.541
But how much is America
willing to sacrifice?

01:13:14.477 --> 01:13:18.538
Do you know how much it costs them
to wage this war?

01:13:22.651 --> 01:13:23.982
General Luna is outside.

01:13:27.189 --> 01:13:28.417
Give us a minute.

01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:32.586
Gentlemen.

01:13:35.464 --> 01:13:36.829
Bring your glasses.

01:13:51.347 --> 01:13:54.510
Twenty four hours jail time
is too short, I see.

01:13:55.384 --> 01:13:57.409
That's why I surrendered.

01:13:58.954 --> 01:13:59.750
Brandy?

01:14:04.827 --> 01:14:05.987
Mister President,

01:14:08.798 --> 01:14:12.359
I would like to resign
as Head of the Armed Forces.

01:14:14.203 --> 01:14:15.135
Why?

01:14:16.205 --> 01:14:19.868
It's impossible to do my job
under these circumstances.

01:14:23.145 --> 01:14:25.214
Especially when I just heard

01:14:25.214 --> 01:14:28.115
that the traitors Paterno and Buencamino
have been set free.

01:14:31.086 --> 01:14:33.020
They are respected citizens.

01:14:33.722 --> 01:14:35.591
They have contributed
resources to our cause

01:14:35.591 --> 01:14:39.186
They promoted annexation
undertheEnemy s flag

01:14:40.162 --> 01:14:42.528
while our soldiers and I

01:14:42.932 --> 01:14:46.732
are out there fighting
the very same enemy.

01:14:47.703 --> 01:14:51.298
I will not accept such treason
while I'm alive.

01:14:52.508 --> 01:14:53.167
General Luna,

01:14:54.610 --> 01:14:56.339
you maybe a military genius

01:14:56.912 --> 01:14:58.709
but you Do not understand politics.

01:14:59.081 --> 01:15:01.917
If setting traitors free
is how you define politics,

01:15:01.917 --> 01:15:03.714
then I want no part of it.

01:15:09.225 --> 01:15:10.920
I am sorry

01:15:13.128 --> 01:15:15.064
but I cannot accept your resignation.

01:15:15.064 --> 01:15:17.999
But I cannot
You are the only one

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:20.061
who can lead our Army.

01:15:21.737 --> 01:15:23.534
Our Motherland needs you.

01:15:25.541 --> 01:15:27.702
Then allow me to lead.

01:15:28.777 --> 01:15:31.837
Allow me to in still discipline!

01:15:40.556 --> 01:15:41.955
And please approve

01:15:42.391 --> 01:15:45.121
my plan to erect
a fortress up North.

01:15:45.794 --> 01:15:48.888
That is the only way
of defeating the Americans.

01:16:25.668 --> 01:16:28.466
What can you tell me about
General Luna,

01:16:28.804 --> 01:16:31.271
aside from what we've already seen?

01:16:34.276 --> 01:16:36.403
We have something to confess.

01:16:40.516 --> 01:16:43.576
We believe he has a hidden agenda.

01:16:44.053 --> 01:16:46.078
This happened recently.

01:16:47.323 --> 01:16:49.154
General Luna lost his temper

01:16:49.892 --> 01:16:51.985
in front of everyone at the plaza.

01:16:52.962 --> 01:16:54.122
What's new about that?

01:16:54.663 --> 01:16:55.357
He said

01:16:55.864 --> 01:16:59.129
he wont hesitate to shoot all traitors,

01:17:00.369 --> 01:17:02.769
even if it was you, MisterPresident.

01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:07.275
And there are rumours that...

01:17:08.077 --> 01:17:13.208
he might be thinking of installing himseIf
as supreme Military Dictator to replace you.

01:17:15.017 --> 01:17:15.881
Where did you hear this?

01:17:16.385 --> 01:17:20.055
I'myseIfwitnessed
his outburst at the plaza.

01:17:20.055 --> 01:17:22.758
We heard from other officers

01:17:22.758 --> 01:17:25.693
about his plans.

01:17:27.029 --> 01:17:28.053
Those are just rumors.

01:17:29.865 --> 01:17:31.162
You knowLuna,

01:17:32.668 --> 01:17:33.869
fullofhot air.

01:17:33.869 --> 01:17:36.030
He does not hide his feelings.

01:17:37.106 --> 01:17:39.040
It may be hot airtous

01:17:39.508 --> 01:17:41.744
but Luna means what he says.

01:17:41.744 --> 01:17:44.780
And we all know
he can be blinded by anger

01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:46.304
like a raging bull.

01:17:49.585 --> 01:17:51.815
Luna is my most capable general.

01:17:54.523 --> 01:17:55.512
We still have Goyong.

01:17:55.758 --> 01:17:56.918
And Ricarte.

01:17:57.793 --> 01:17:58.885
I'm here too.

01:18:01.530 --> 01:18:02.724
Let's not forget

01:18:03.399 --> 01:18:06.163
that he abandoned hispostinBagbag,

01:18:06.735 --> 01:18:08.362
resuIting in great losses.

01:18:09.038 --> 01:18:11.306
Our country would be
in a sad state indeed

01:18:11.306 --> 01:18:13.740
if only one man is capable
of leading the military.

01:18:30.893 --> 01:18:33.794
Luna does more harm than good.

01:18:36.932 --> 01:18:39.526
He must be replaced.

01:18:42.571 --> 01:18:43.469
If only we could...

01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:52.545
Thank you,gentlemen.

01:18:53.348 --> 01:18:56.044
I need time to think.

01:19:37.893 --> 01:19:38.825
God dammit!

01:19:43.031 --> 01:19:44.020
Who the hell is knocking?

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.127
I've been knocking forever.

01:19:48.704 --> 01:19:49.432
Mother?

01:19:50.205 --> 01:19:51.137
What brings you here?

01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:53.439
My little Antonio.

01:19:53.675 --> 01:19:54.699
Let me see.

01:19:56.845 --> 01:19:58.369
You'll live.

01:20:00.182 --> 01:20:01.483
I heard you had him arrested...

01:20:01.483 --> 01:20:02.472
Mascardo?

01:20:04.186 --> 01:20:05.483
Yes,after
No.

01:20:05.754 --> 01:20:07.654
Quinito, your brother.

01:20:09.658 --> 01:20:10.000
Was it over a woman?

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.990
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!
Was it over a woman?

01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:12.828
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:12.828 --> 01:20:13.624
Yes.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:13.829 --> 01:20:14.523
Was he drunk?
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:14.523 --> 01:20:17.065
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:17.065 --> 01:20:18.157
Has he been set free?
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:18.157 --> 01:20:20.035
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:20.035 --> 01:20:21.832
He was in jail for only two nights.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:21.832 --> 01:20:22.000
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:23.505 --> 01:20:24.301
Good.

01:20:25.707 --> 01:20:27.698
No one is above the law.

01:20:29.611 --> 01:20:30.578
Yes, mother.

01:20:32.181 --> 01:20:34.012
You look haggard

01:20:35.951 --> 01:20:36.975
and thin.

01:20:37.953 --> 01:20:39.420
Do you still get to sleep?

01:20:40.923 --> 01:20:42.891
We're in the middle of a war.

01:20:42.891 --> 01:20:43.858
I know that.

01:20:47.362 --> 01:20:50.229
We gave you a good education.

01:20:51.099 --> 01:20:56.662
But you still chose to be
in the middle of this mess.

01:21:00.042 --> 01:21:01.441
It's my destiny, Mother.

01:21:02.978 --> 01:21:04.002
I sit?

01:21:12.888 --> 01:21:14.014
Sit down.

01:21:22.831 --> 01:21:24.458
Close your eyes.

01:21:27.469 --> 01:21:28.527
Close them.

01:21:31.831 --> 01:21:35.232
Do you remember Christmas in Binondo?

01:21:37.036 --> 01:21:38.162
Your sister.

01:21:39.639 --> 01:21:40.765
Numeriana.

01:21:43.175 --> 01:21:45.143
The gifts by the Nativity.

01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:52.749
The music.

01:21:55.688 --> 01:21:57.280
Manuel's violin.

01:21:59.458 --> 01:22:01.824
All the delicious food.

01:22:05.865 --> 01:22:07.492
Jose and Joaquin.

01:22:09.135 --> 01:22:11.501
Who could never wait
to touch the food.

01:22:17.209 --> 01:22:18.506
My beloved father,

01:22:20.479 --> 01:22:21.969
always smiling

01:22:22.315 --> 01:22:23.805
holding his cigar.

01:22:25.384 --> 01:22:26.146
And...

01:22:27.086 --> 01:22:28.053
Juan.

01:22:30.589 --> 01:22:32.887
If only I could be
with all of them again.

01:22:34.327 --> 01:22:38.024
We would dance the night away.

01:22:38.364 --> 01:22:40.195
Do you remember those times?

01:22:41.434 --> 01:22:42.298
Yes.

01:22:47.273 --> 01:22:51.403
And we allowed you and Juan
to study in Europe.

01:22:53.546 --> 01:22:58.074
Where our minds were awakened
about the state of the country.

01:22:59.518 --> 01:23:04.353
It all began with a dream to win
our rights under Spain,

01:23:06.025 --> 01:23:08.255
until we woke up to the truth...

01:23:09.729 --> 01:23:13.756
due to their ceaseless
condescension of our race

01:23:15.468 --> 01:23:17.902
that we are no different from them.

01:23:19.238 --> 01:23:23.572
But those dreams were shattered
when they killed Dr. Jose Rizal.

01:23:27.613 --> 01:23:30.411
I grow sad whenever I think of him,

01:23:31.384 --> 01:23:33.545
and his sacrifice.

01:23:36.322 --> 01:23:38.779
My idolized country,
sorrow of my sorrows,

01:23:38.991 --> 01:23:40.856
Beloved Filipinas,

01:23:42.261 --> 01:23:44.092
hear my last goodbye.

01:23:44.397 --> 01:23:46.058
There l leave you all,

01:23:47.767 --> 01:23:49.359
my parents,

01:23:50.102 --> 01:23:51.933
my loves.

01:23:53.172 --> 01:23:56.409
Goodbye, dear parents, brother and sisters,
fragments of my soul,

01:23:56.409 --> 01:23:58.400
Childhood friends in the home now lost,

01:23:59.612 --> 01:24:02.376
Give thanks that I rest
from this wear I someday;

01:24:02.681 --> 01:24:05.309
Goodbye, sweet foreigner,
my friend, my joy;

01:24:05.751 --> 01:24:07.582
Farewell, loved ones,

01:24:08.487 --> 01:24:09.855
to die...

01:24:09.855 --> 01:24:11.254
is to rest.

01:24:18.631 --> 01:24:21.225
The biggest sacrifice of all.

01:24:22.501 --> 01:24:26.938
But that is not the only way
of showing your love for the country.

01:24:27.807 --> 01:24:29.832
Your brother Juan knows that.

01:24:30.609 --> 01:24:33.305
But Juan alsoknowstheFilipinomind.

01:24:35.181 --> 01:24:38.309
Were all divided and blind
to the concept of nationhood.

01:24:39.952 --> 01:24:42.455
He knows we will not wake up

01:24:42.455 --> 01:24:45.424
until someone
sacrifices himseIf for the country.

01:24:47.893 --> 01:24:49.361
In our travels in Europe,

01:24:49.361 --> 01:24:52.592
the only thing that became clear
was what we all lacked.

01:24:54.467 --> 01:24:56.196
l know what you're saying,son.

01:24:57.870 --> 01:25:00.839
These are the fruits
of your love for us, mother.

01:25:02.074 --> 01:25:03.371
Juan and l.

01:25:04.743 --> 01:25:06.506
Our convictions.

01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:12.014
You and Juan we're always the closest.

01:25:12.985 --> 01:25:14.612
And in some ways,

01:25:16.222 --> 01:25:18.190
we share the same destiny.

01:25:18.991 --> 01:25:20.652
Destiny, Antoñito?

01:25:22.761 --> 01:25:25.628
Is this destiny or choice?

01:25:27.333 --> 01:25:29.392
You've become a skilled doctor.

01:25:30.169 --> 01:25:33.332
There's a peaceful life within your reach

01:25:34.373 --> 01:25:37.240
but you choose to wage war.

01:25:39.044 --> 01:25:41.376
Some politicians and businessmen

01:25:41.514 --> 01:25:43.243
don t like the way you are running things.

01:25:44.450 --> 01:25:45.678
They say you are too arrogant

01:25:46.552 --> 01:25:47.177
and strict.

01:25:48.721 --> 01:25:50.848
They say you are mad with power.

01:25:52.458 --> 01:25:54.153
Don't mind the rumors.

01:25:55.861 --> 01:25:57.920
II have a job to do and sometimes

01:25:58.464 --> 01:26:00.557
II have to step on some toes
to get it done.

01:26:02.768 --> 01:26:04.258
I heard from Quinito.

01:26:04.537 --> 01:26:09.668
It's possible that the President
himself is against you.

01:26:10.309 --> 01:26:12.368
Aguinaldo is not stupid.

01:26:12.912 --> 01:26:14.607
We respect each other.

01:26:15.114 --> 01:26:16.547
We are both Masons.

01:26:17.449 --> 01:26:19.417
Like Andres Bonifacio?

01:26:25.991 --> 01:26:27.015
Here.

01:26:28.761 --> 01:26:30.126
Wear this.

01:26:35.734 --> 01:26:40.603
Your father and brother Manuel are dead.

01:26:42.741 --> 01:26:44.766
I don't want anything to happen

01:26:45.144 --> 01:26:49.103
to you and your brother Juan
because of this war.

01:27:23.319 --> 01:27:27.085
People who feel are not slaves.

01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:38.261
The beautiful days of Roses
have come to an end.

01:27:39.468 --> 01:27:44.667
The white nights of our thorny
patriotic apostolate begins.

01:27:50.146 --> 01:27:51.636
Our native land,

01:27:53.983 --> 01:27:55.712
the blue skies,

01:27:57.553 --> 01:28:00.954
green fields, a land of art and feeling.

01:28:02.658 --> 01:28:04.649
Has everyone left?

01:28:04.927 --> 01:28:05.689
Yes,sir.

01:28:05.861 --> 01:28:07.988
Only the Kawit Brigade will remain.

01:28:08.697 --> 01:28:09.891
Soon,

01:28:11.233 --> 01:28:13.369
for love of our Motherland,

01:28:13.369 --> 01:28:14.336
Dismissed!

01:28:17.006 --> 01:28:19.304
as if by some hidden code,

01:28:21.210 --> 01:28:23.644
we are snatched by a secret hand

01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:27.383
and tossed about like leaves
in a tempestuous wind.

01:28:27.383 --> 01:28:30.841
I'm asking for assurance
of your loyaIty,

01:28:31.687 --> 01:28:33.314
can l rely on you?

01:28:33.689 --> 01:28:35.657
Yes, Mr. President!

01:28:39.762 --> 01:28:41.093
Soon...

01:28:41.363 --> 01:28:42.557
Dismissed!

01:28:43.599 --> 01:28:47.035
We will be whirlwinds of dust.

01:28:59.748 --> 01:29:02.546
I can't remember
when I wrote that poem.

01:29:07.122 --> 01:29:08.783
I have a question.

01:29:10.793 --> 01:29:14.524
Do you of ten think that your life
is in danger?

01:29:15.464 --> 01:29:16.795
Because of the war?

01:29:17.733 --> 01:29:18.961
Because of your principles.

01:29:25.153 --> 01:29:25.983
Everyday.

01:29:30.625 --> 01:29:33.294
Bring your troops here,
on the other side of the river.

01:29:33.294 --> 01:29:34.158
General,

01:29:34.495 --> 01:29:36.190
bring your army here.

01:29:38.032 --> 01:29:38.930
Come in.

01:29:44.672 --> 01:29:46.333
From President Aguinaldo.

01:30:05.259 --> 01:30:07.124
Gentlemen, I have great news!

01:30:09.997 --> 01:30:11.899
President Aguinaldo
is establishing a new cabinet

01:30:11.899 --> 01:30:14.527
and has asked me
to go toCabanatuan to lead.

01:30:14.769 --> 01:30:15.997
Finally, things are moving forward.

01:30:17.271 --> 01:30:19.034
Congratulations!

01:30:27.448 --> 01:30:28.745
Lieutenant Manuel Quezon.

01:30:29.250 --> 01:30:30.342
It's been a while.

01:30:30.885 --> 01:30:32.011
Mr.President.

01:30:32.787 --> 01:30:34.222
Did you receive my orders?

01:30:34.222 --> 01:30:35.052
Yes,sir.

01:30:35.723 --> 01:30:38.384
My men and I are to proceed
to San Isidro.

01:30:41.596 --> 01:30:43.496
Your guards are staying behind?

01:30:55.943 --> 01:30:57.877
My dearest Mother...

01:30:59.747 --> 01:31:00.611
Sir.

01:31:01.115 --> 01:31:02.377
we're ready.

01:31:15.296 --> 01:31:16.058
Sir.

01:31:21.102 --> 01:31:22.091
Colonel,

01:31:22.603 --> 01:31:25.094
don't you get tired of fighting

01:31:26.474 --> 01:31:28.135
and all that spilled blood?

01:31:30.311 --> 01:31:33.280
No blood is wasted
for the true patriot.

01:31:33.814 --> 01:31:36.908
To endure hardship is not to suffer.

01:31:37.818 --> 01:31:39.285
It's like receiving a blessing,

01:31:40.154 --> 01:31:41.382
like love.

01:31:43.024 --> 01:31:45.652
Do you think we'll win?

01:31:46.994 --> 01:31:48.427
I cant assure that.

01:31:49.463 --> 01:31:50.487
But if we do win,

01:31:51.432 --> 01:31:53.161
it is a baptism of fire,

01:31:53.935 --> 01:31:55.835
like a cataclysmic whirlwind.

01:31:57.805 --> 01:31:59.540
l see you have a poetic streak

01:31:59.540 --> 01:32:00.837
liketheGeneral.

01:32:03.811 --> 01:32:04.778
He's contagious.

01:32:20.895 --> 01:32:21.486
General!

01:32:23.331 --> 01:32:23.965
General!

01:32:23.965 --> 01:32:24.498
Yes.

01:32:24.498 --> 01:32:25.658
They cannot cross.

01:32:38.579 --> 01:32:40.877
It looks like fate
is trying to stop us.

01:32:41.749 --> 01:32:44.809
Or maybe those wagons
are from Kawit.

01:32:46.721 --> 01:32:47.380
Roman,

01:32:47.888 --> 01:32:48.547
Rusca,

01:32:49.190 --> 01:32:50.350
We are going ahead.

01:32:51.592 --> 01:32:52.388
Manuel,

01:32:53.327 --> 01:32:54.794
catch up with us in Cabanatuan.

01:32:55.329 --> 01:32:56.193
Yes,sir.

01:32:58.833 --> 01:33:00.858
Take care of the kid.

01:33:16.083 --> 01:33:16.981
What s wrong, brother?

01:33:18.185 --> 01:33:19.880
They should've waited for us.

01:33:31.581 --> 01:33:32.570
Where's everybody?

01:33:33.283 --> 01:33:34.648
They're probably having lunch.

01:33:35.752 --> 01:33:37.049
It doesn't matter,
were already here.

01:33:58.775 --> 01:34:00.106
You take a rest.

01:34:01.111 --> 01:34:02.271
Wait for me here.

01:34:02.812 --> 01:34:03.904
Good luck, General.

01:34:45.922 --> 01:34:46.980
You,soldier.

01:34:49.425 --> 01:34:51.359
Why is your uniform so dirty?

01:34:52.996 --> 01:34:54.224
Why did you not salute me?

01:34:55.532 --> 01:34:56.396
What are your names?

01:34:58.735 --> 01:34:59.724
Are you fucking deaf?

01:35:01.771 --> 01:35:03.466
What kind of soldiers are you?

01:35:05.041 --> 01:35:06.633
I see his spirits are up.

01:35:09.512 --> 01:35:10.911
When I come down,

01:35:12.081 --> 01:35:13.981
you better have your hair cut

01:35:14.551 --> 01:35:15.540
or else,

01:35:16.119 --> 01:35:18.019
I will shoot you!

01:36:03.066 --> 01:36:04.334
Mr. President.

01:36:04.334 --> 01:36:05.130
I've...

01:36:08.238 --> 01:36:09.034
Shit.

01:36:10.607 --> 01:36:11.869
What are you doing here?

01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:15.400
l should ask you that.

01:36:16.312 --> 01:36:19.440
ThePresident sent me a telegram.
Where is he?

01:36:20.850 --> 01:36:21.851
He left

01:36:21.851 --> 01:36:22.819
at dawn.

01:36:22.819 --> 01:36:23.911
He left?

01:36:26.522 --> 01:36:27.819
Then why did he ask me
to come here?

01:36:29.492 --> 01:36:32.120
What kind of government is this?

01:36:32.862 --> 01:36:34.097
Maybe he forgot.

01:36:34.097 --> 01:36:35.325
Impossible.

01:36:38.201 --> 01:36:40.726
And why are you sitting
at the President s desk?

01:36:42.639 --> 01:36:46.131
Shouldn't you be
shining American boots?

01:36:49.946 --> 01:36:51.675
What damned arrogance.

01:36:52.682 --> 01:36:54.741
You think you're the only patriot?

01:36:56.953 --> 01:36:58.477
In this room, yes.

01:36:59.522 --> 01:37:01.524
l love my country.

01:37:01.524 --> 01:37:05.290
But not enough
to fight or die for her!

01:37:07.964 --> 01:37:09.829
If you werehaIf a man,

01:37:11.067 --> 01:37:12.835
I would challenge you to a duel.

01:37:12.835 --> 01:37:14.427
Just try me.

01:37:20.743 --> 01:37:22.870
I've had enough of those sissies.

01:37:29.385 --> 01:37:30.443
We're not finished.

01:37:51.607 --> 01:37:53.666
Who fired that shot?

01:37:54.744 --> 01:37:55.870
Dammit!

01:37:57.714 --> 01:37:58.373
Who?

01:38:07.757 --> 01:38:09.247
Aren't you supposed to be in jail?

01:38:10.893 --> 01:38:12.326
Why did they set you free?

01:38:31.381 --> 01:38:32.348
Wait! Don't form a circle!

01:38:37.754 --> 01:38:38.686
What's going on?

01:38:57.907 --> 01:38:59.101
Cowards!

01:38:59.942 --> 01:39:01.375
Traitors!

01:39:02.445 --> 01:39:04.811
Murderers!

01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:54.989
Traitor!

01:40:08.377 --> 01:40:09.344
Wait!

01:40:09.745 --> 01:40:11.337
I surrender!

01:40:24.694 --> 01:40:25.786
Use your machetes.

01:40:26.762 --> 01:40:28.161
He's done for.

01:41:37.333 --> 01:41:38.459
Cowards...

01:41:40.236 --> 01:41:41.897
Assassins...

01:41:48.811 --> 01:41:50.574
He faced them alone.

01:41:54.150 --> 01:41:56.243
I couldn't do anything to help.

01:41:59.956 --> 01:42:01.617
I will never understand

01:42:02.692 --> 01:42:06.423
why Filipinos kill Filipinos.

01:42:09.432 --> 01:42:14.495
In killing the General,
they killedalI hope for freedom.

01:42:24.981 --> 01:42:27.176
Well? Is he still moving?

01:42:33.356 --> 01:42:34.948
The General was right.

01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:43.088
We are our own worst enemy.

01:42:47.336 --> 01:42:49.930
We killed him.

01:43:00.349 --> 01:43:03.719
I swear before God

01:43:03.719 --> 01:43:08.024
and in the names
of my father and sons,

01:43:08.024 --> 01:43:11.221
that I had nothing to do
with this incident.

01:43:11.994 --> 01:43:13.562
I had nothing to do
with AntonioLunasdeath.

01:43:13.562 --> 01:43:15.462
I had nothing to do
with Antonio Lunas death.

01:43:16.899 --> 01:43:19.335
It was all his fauIt.

01:43:19.335 --> 01:43:22.571
He assauIted theKawitBrigade.

01:43:22.571 --> 01:43:24.971
Luna abused his power

01:43:26.042 --> 01:43:27.873
and was terribly ambitious,

01:43:28.244 --> 01:43:30.405
even plotting to take over

01:43:30.513 --> 01:43:33.744
the highest position in the land.

01:43:35.217 --> 01:43:37.742
Son of a bitch, I found it first!
That's mine!

01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:48.394
Luna's accusations
against me were all lies.

01:43:48.698 --> 01:43:50.757
I love my country.

01:43:52.768 --> 01:43:55.430
Look at the records of my public service.

01:43:56.072 --> 01:43:58.641
I'm a de great sacrifices

01:43:58.641 --> 01:44:01.872
for this country!

01:44:07.450 --> 01:44:09.111
Luna and I clashed on many issues

01:44:10.419 --> 01:44:12.887
but I did not kill him.

01:44:15.758 --> 01:44:17.521
I said that's mine!
But I found it.

01:44:18.494 --> 01:44:19.426
Give that tome.

01:44:23.566 --> 01:44:25.801
Luna's death

01:44:25.801 --> 01:44:29.237
is a form of historical cleansing.

01:44:30.239 --> 01:44:32.139
Wait. We're not done with him.

01:44:33.743 --> 01:44:35.611
Antonio Luna

01:44:35.611 --> 01:44:36.737
was cruel,

01:44:38.514 --> 01:44:40.311
abusive

01:44:40.683 --> 01:44:41.945
and arrogant!

01:44:45.154 --> 01:44:47.247
I did not want him to die

01:44:50.126 --> 01:44:51.388
but I admit...

01:44:52.461 --> 01:44:54.088
I believe

01:44:54.997 --> 01:44:57.158
that he deserved his fate.

01:45:18.687 --> 01:45:19.483
Hold on.

01:45:20.322 --> 01:45:21.846
Move them over here.

01:46:31.627 --> 01:46:34.994
It was Luna
who sent me a telegram

01:46:36.732 --> 01:46:42.102
saying that he was coming
to see me in Cabanatuan.

01:46:45.908 --> 01:46:48.672
But I was not there at that time.

01:47:46.135 --> 01:47:49.070
When the crime happened,

01:47:49.772 --> 01:47:52.172
I was in Bulacan and Pampanga,

01:47:53.943 --> 01:47:57.470
inspecting General del Pilar's troops

01:48:00.316 --> 01:48:02.113
checking ammunition.

01:48:22.538 --> 01:48:25.598
Lunas death was a heavy blow.

01:48:26.742 --> 01:48:30.678
he was the only one capable
of leading us to Independence.

01:48:35.918 --> 01:48:37.852
He was my most brilliant general.

01:48:39.588 --> 01:48:41.317
Why would I want him killed?

01:49:08.784 --> 01:49:09.682
No.

01:49:10.219 --> 01:49:11.516
There was no conspiracy.

01:49:12.454 --> 01:49:13.853
No threats.

01:49:15.057 --> 01:49:17.423
Luna was my best general.

01:49:22.097 --> 01:49:23.997
I lost the war.

01:49:26.235 --> 01:49:27.930
We all lost.

01:49:38.648 --> 01:49:41.785
TheFilipinonationseeks
its independence

01:49:41.785 --> 01:49:47.223
and I will sustain the cause
of my country untiIthe very end.

01:49:49.693 --> 01:49:52.161
It is always better to fall
on the field of battle

01:49:52.963 --> 01:49:55.397
than to accept any foreign rule.

01:49:56.867 --> 01:50:00.064
If Progress is just a dream,

01:50:01.171 --> 01:50:03.662
Let us dream on until death.

01:50:04.941 --> 01:50:08.672
Soon,for love of our Motherland

01:50:10.347 --> 01:50:13.339
as if by some hidden code

01:50:14.851 --> 01:50:17.354
we are snatched by a secret Hand,

01:50:17.354 --> 01:50:18.989
like leaves from trees

01:50:18.989 --> 01:50:21.787
scattered by a tempestuous wind.

01:50:25.695 --> 01:50:27.162
Soon,

01:50:29.232 --> 01:50:33.601
We will be whirlwinds of dust.

01:53:56.238 --> 01:53:57.262
General,

01:53:59.141 --> 01:54:01.507
these are what's left of Lunas men.

01:54:04.046 --> 01:54:05.673
What do you want to do with them?

01:54:10.986 --> 01:54:12.544
Get sixty.

01:54:30.239 --> 01:54:35.404
My heart dwells in you

01:54:37.913 --> 01:54:44.275
My life's beginning and end.

01:54:46.088 --> 01:54:52.755
I wilI hope to the fullest

01:54:53.195 --> 01:55:00.067
And dream until the end.

01:55:01.136 --> 01:55:07.735
I will not seek conflict

01:55:08.210 --> 01:55:11.714
But if need be

01:55:11.714 --> 01:55:16.344
I will give my life to you

01:55:16.652 --> 01:55:20.315
So you can be free

01:55:20.556 --> 01:55:24.356
To love in peace

01:55:24.493 --> 01:55:28.397
And live in this world

01:55:28.397 --> 01:55:32.201
Without fear and strife

01:55:32.201 --> 01:55:35.738
To see you free

01:55:35.738 --> 01:55:39.575
Is my sole prayer.

01:55:39.575 --> 01:55:45.844
I will embrace and love you

01:55:46.048 --> 01:55:50.382
Until there's no tomorrow.

01:55:56.859 --> 01:56:03.526
Victory or death.

01:56:04.667 --> 01:56:11.539
I will face the darkness of uncertainty.

01:56:12.107 --> 01:56:18.307
This is the life I chose:

01:56:19.582 --> 01:56:26.681
To love you wholly and truly.

01:56:27.523 --> 01:56:34.429
I will not seek conflict

01:56:34.763 --> 01:56:38.033
But if need be

01:56:38.033 --> 01:56:42.732
I will give my life to you

01:56:42.938 --> 01:56:47.076
So you can be free

01:56:47.076 --> 01:56:51.046
To love in peace

01:56:51.046 --> 01:56:54.950
And live in this world

01:56:54.950 --> 01:56:58.554
Without fear and strife

01:56:58.554 --> 01:57:02.491
To see you free

01:57:02.491 --> 01:57:05.894
Is my sole prayer.

01:57:05.894 --> 01:57:12.129
I will embrace and love you

01:57:12.601 --> 01:57:16.935
Until there's no tomorrow.

01:57:17.740 --> 01:57:21.642
To the end,

01:57:21.844 --> 01:57:25.514
I will be by your side

01:57:25.514 --> 01:57:28.684
To the end,

01:57:28.684 --> 01:57:36.056
Your name will resound on my lips.

01:57:36.925 --> 01:57:40.663
So you can be free

01:57:40.663 --> 01:57:44.667
To love in peace

01:57:44.667 --> 01:57:48.804
And live in this world

01:57:48.804 --> 01:57:52.307
Without fear and strife

01:57:52.307 --> 01:57:56.178
To see you free

01:57:56.178 --> 01:57:59.715
Is my sole prayer.

01:57:59.715 --> 01:58:06.086
I will embrace and love you

01:58:06.455 --> 01:58:12.416
Until there's no tomorrow.

01:58:14.029 --> 01:58:20.264
Until there's no tomorrow.

01:58:21.704 --> 01:58:24.969
Until there's no tomorrow.
