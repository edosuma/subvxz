00:04.363 --> 00:06.998
If you could attend one moment
in comic book history,

00:07.032 --> 00:09.233
- What would it be?
- Wow.

00:09.251 --> 00:10.435
Like, I'm thinking, like,
you're there,

00:10.469 --> 00:12.353
You know what's coming up...

00:12.388 --> 00:15.440
I'm gonna go with
the death of Superman.

00:15.474 --> 00:16.841
That's a good one.

00:16.876 --> 00:17.992
I would like to be
on the streets of Metropolis

00:18.043 --> 00:20.612
To see that epic battle
take place.

00:20.646 --> 00:22.313
What about you, Ming?

00:22.348 --> 00:25.116
How 'bout when Superman's ship
from Krypton lands on Earth?

00:25.150 --> 00:27.936
Ma and pa Kent
find the Superbaby.

00:27.987 --> 00:29.554
There's nothing
that happens though!

00:29.572 --> 00:31.722
He just gets picked up
out of the rocket ship,

00:31.740 --> 00:33.908
Put in the jalopy
pickup truck,

00:33.943 --> 00:35.827
D driven away
on an old dirt road.

00:35.861 --> 00:38.162
No, it goes into the house.
Ming's like, "awesome."

00:38.197 --> 00:39.914
[laughter]

00:39.965 --> 00:43.167
The baby doesn't do nothin'
that a normal baby wouldn't do.

00:43.202 --> 00:44.736
But I know
what he becomes though.

00:44.770 --> 00:45.954
- I know--
- That's the origin of--

00:45.988 --> 00:47.655
Don't you want to see
something spectacular?

00:47.706 --> 00:49.407
What about Antman?

00:49.441 --> 00:52.377
I see here that he had sex with
his dead friend's girlfriend

00:52.411 --> 00:54.579
On his dead friend's grave.

00:54.613 --> 00:56.180
- So you'd want to watch that?
- Yeah.

00:56.215 --> 00:57.549
Or, like,
I'd be at the grave

00:57.583 --> 00:58.950
Two weeks before it happens

00:58.984 --> 01:00.318
Because I know
what's going to happen.

01:00.352 --> 01:02.887

Hello, and welcome to another
episode of Comic Book Men,

01:41.710 --> 01:44.495
The only show that also hates
that stupid Batman voice.

01:44.530 --> 01:45.930
I'm your host, Kevin Smith.

01:45.965 --> 01:47.832
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

01:47.866 --> 01:49.467
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

01:49.501 --> 01:51.902
So what come through
the doors this week?

01:51.921 --> 01:54.071
Had one of the weirdest items
come in the other day.

01:54.089 --> 01:57.775
I mean, we've had toys,
original artwork,

01:57.810 --> 02:01.045
Obviously comics,
but never an item like this.

02:02.414 --> 02:03.765
- Hey guys.
- Whoa.

02:03.816 --> 02:05.149
- How's it going?
- Whoa.

02:05.184 --> 02:08.386
We don't serve your kind here.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.354
Not the droid
you're looking for?

02:10.389 --> 02:11.756
Eh?

02:11.790 --> 02:14.375
[laughter]

02:14.410 --> 02:15.960
What's up?
What do you got there, man?

02:15.995 --> 02:19.664
This is a R2-Q5
Xbox 360.

02:26.105 --> 02:28.139
I don't remember him
from the movies.

02:28.173 --> 02:30.808
- Return of the Jedi?
- Wait, what scene?

02:30.843 --> 02:32.577
It's a real small scene.
He just kind of cruises by.

02:32.611 --> 02:33.995
How much screen time
does he have?

02:34.029 --> 02:35.279
About a second.

02:35.314 --> 02:37.115
Why him and not the droid
that everyone knows?

02:37.149 --> 02:39.083
- R2?
- Yeah.

02:39.118 --> 02:40.618
It's probably because
every single thing

02:40.653 --> 02:43.237
In the Lucas Universe
has already been merchandised.

02:43.272 --> 02:46.658
This was the very last thing,
and he got a hold of it.

02:46.692 --> 02:48.459
If you were gonna pick
any droid

02:48.494 --> 02:50.545
To jam an Xbox inside of,

02:50.579 --> 02:52.664
Why would you pick
that droid?

02:52.698 --> 02:53.765
It makes no sense, right?

02:53.799 --> 02:56.868
- I mean, why black R2-D2?
- No, no, no.

02:56.902 --> 02:59.370
It wasn't R2-D2.
It was R2-Q5.

02:59.405 --> 03:00.571
Why would you know that?

03:00.606 --> 03:02.273
And why are you being
so [bleep] about it?

03:02.307 --> 03:04.659
- I know.
- Oh, my Lord.

03:04.710 --> 03:07.628
You're just like, "No, no, no!
It wasn't that!"

03:07.663 --> 03:09.347
Well, just get it right.

03:09.381 --> 03:11.516
I'm just gonna call it
"the black R2-D2."

03:11.550 --> 03:13.518
That's certainly
the best way to sell it, man.

03:13.552 --> 03:15.820
[laughter]

03:15.854 --> 03:17.722
This is one I had extra,
lying around,

03:17.756 --> 03:19.056
And I thought
I'd come bring it to the shop

03:19.074 --> 03:20.091
And see what you guys thought.

03:20.125 --> 03:21.626
I make 'em custom-order.

03:21.660 --> 03:23.811
I can make you guys
a regular R2

03:23.862 --> 03:26.030
If you're not so fond
of the R2-Q5.

03:26.065 --> 03:29.133
Well, I'm sure that this guy's
catching up to R2-D2

03:29.167 --> 03:31.402
In terms of popularity, right?
[laughter]

03:31.437 --> 03:34.439
But yeah, it's got a built-in
projector right here.

03:34.473 --> 03:35.990
Really?
What do you project off that?

03:36.025 --> 03:38.993
Princess Leia, dude.
Like, "Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

03:39.028 --> 03:40.311
- You're my only hope."
- Right?

03:40.329 --> 03:43.831
Yep. Anything.
Dvd, video games.

03:43.866 --> 03:46.484
So this is a projector
gaming console?

03:46.518 --> 03:48.069
Yeah.

03:48.120 --> 03:50.722
I see on the bottom it has,
like, an internet connection?

03:50.756 --> 03:52.323
Yeah, yeah.
It's got everything, man.

03:52.357 --> 03:54.809
It's got digital optical
audio right there.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.694
That's an odd place
for an input, isn't it?

03:56.729 --> 03:58.062
- The location?
- Yeah.

03:58.097 --> 03:59.497
Is everything with you
got to be--

03:59.531 --> 04:01.382
Go in that direction,
even a robot?

04:01.417 --> 04:02.700
Right in the toilet.

04:02.718 --> 04:04.335
I'm just saying,
I might be tempted.

04:04.369 --> 04:08.639
[laughter]

04:08.674 --> 04:10.108
And you brought it
in here today to what?

04:10.142 --> 04:11.843
- I just want to sell it.
- Okay.

04:11.877 --> 04:13.745
Well, what does
something like this go for?

04:13.779 --> 04:15.980
I ask $1,300.

04:16.014 --> 04:17.598
Oh.

04:17.649 --> 04:19.416
- $1,300, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

04:19.451 --> 04:21.035
- Can I check it out?
- Yeah.

04:21.070 --> 04:22.220
Can I see what ilooks like
projected?

04:22.254 --> 04:23.921
- You want to take it back here?
- Sure.

04:23.955 --> 04:26.390
He's selling all the bells
and whistles it has.

04:26.425 --> 04:29.677
It can do this.
It's got hd and stuff like that.

04:29.711 --> 04:31.629
And we wanted to see
if it works.

04:31.663 --> 04:34.565
What'd you give him, ming?
Something--something cool?

04:34.600 --> 04:37.502
Something near and dear
to our hearts.

04:37.536 --> 04:39.537
All right.

04:41.707 --> 04:43.374
- You want comics?
- We got that.

04:43.408 --> 04:44.809
You want Wonder Woman
and Wolverine?

04:44.843 --> 04:46.944
- Oh, Lord.
- We got that!

04:46.979 --> 04:48.112
Out of everything
we could have watched,

04:48.146 --> 04:49.380
And that's what you pick?

04:49.414 --> 04:51.916
And you also have the option
to do hdmi output,

04:51.950 --> 04:53.518
So if you want
the high quality,

04:53.552 --> 04:54.952
You can just plug it
into your big screen.

04:54.987 --> 04:57.088
You can sell your comics
for cash!

04:57.122 --> 04:59.857
- I always love that moment.
- Cash!

04:59.892 --> 05:02.293
Okay,
so I think it's awesome.

05:02.327 --> 05:03.928
I would love to have it
in the store.

05:03.962 --> 05:06.731
- Can we step back into my office?
- Sure.

05:06.765 --> 05:09.100
We would love to have it,

05:09.134 --> 05:10.735
But what's the least
you'd take for it today?

05:10.769 --> 05:13.471
I'd be willing to go $1,000
for you.

05:13.505 --> 05:17.475
Knock off $300 and...

05:17.509 --> 05:21.512
I think I got a proposition
that may work for both of us.

05:21.547 --> 05:24.382
- Okay.
- A consignment.

05:24.416 --> 05:27.585
There's no way I'm going
to buy this thing outright,

05:27.603 --> 05:29.971
So I figured, "let's think
a little outside the box."

05:30.005 --> 05:32.523
Let's call the police and say
he's trying to steal it from us.

05:32.558 --> 05:34.025
[laughter]

05:34.059 --> 05:38.095
I think, "how about selling it
on consignment at the Stash?"

05:38.130 --> 05:40.214
Okay, so that's a no-lose
scenario right there.

05:40.249 --> 05:42.233
You're facilitating
the sale,

05:42.267 --> 05:44.335
And it also gets to be shown off
in the store.

05:44.369 --> 05:45.569
- Right.
- That's always nice.

05:45.587 --> 05:46.871
People walk in and be like,
"what's this?

05:46.905 --> 05:48.739
The black R2-D2?"

05:48.774 --> 05:50.174
"That's not R2-D2!"

05:50.208 --> 05:53.911
[laughter]

05:53.946 --> 05:56.097
We put one of your pieces

05:56.148 --> 05:58.032
Prominently displayed
in the store.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.284
- Okay.
- We sell it,

06:00.302 --> 06:01.752
And we take
a small percentage of it.

06:01.786 --> 06:03.654
You get the majority
of the sale,

06:03.689 --> 06:06.073
Plus, maybe I could get
some contact info

06:06.124 --> 06:08.142
Out there to people--
they could do special orders.

06:08.193 --> 06:09.693
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Awesome.

06:09.711 --> 06:10.828
I think that'd really
work out well.

06:10.863 --> 06:11.829
Cool, we got a deal?

06:11.864 --> 06:13.163
All right, man,
you got a deal.

06:13.182 --> 06:14.866
- May the Force be with you.
- All right.

06:14.900 --> 06:16.734
- You guys have a good day.
- Take care.

06:16.768 --> 06:19.003
I'm surprised his Star Wars
line wasn't, like,

06:19.037 --> 06:20.705
"I love you,"
and he's like, "I know."

06:20.739 --> 06:24.876
[laughter]

06:24.910 --> 06:26.244
These are insane.

06:26.278 --> 06:27.645
What kind of a mental patient

06:27.679 --> 06:29.947
Would want to collect these?

06:29.982 --> 06:31.115
I think me.

06:37.653 --> 06:39.087
Hey, you know what
I was thinking?

06:39.122 --> 06:42.841
If you guys had to live
in one cartoon environment

06:42.892 --> 06:44.159
For the rest of your lives,

06:44.193 --> 06:46.294
Which cartoon world
would you guys choose?

06:46.329 --> 06:48.129
Now, take in consideration,

06:48.147 --> 06:51.800
You can't interact with
the stars of the said cartoon.

06:51.834 --> 06:53.401
You're just
background players.

06:53.436 --> 06:55.837
So it's real life,
except I'm animated?

06:55.872 --> 06:57.155
[laughter]

06:57.190 --> 06:58.874
- Exactly.
- Okay.

06:58.908 --> 07:00.876
Let me go first, 'cause I've
given it a lot of thought.

07:00.910 --> 07:04.279
- Bedrock. The Flintstones.
- Why Bedrock?

07:04.313 --> 07:07.315
I'd like to test myself
in a much more primal age.

07:07.350 --> 07:08.950
What about you?

07:08.985 --> 07:10.402
I'm gonna go with
the other end of the spectrum--

07:10.453 --> 07:11.837
- The Jetsons.
- I knew it.

07:11.871 --> 07:14.556
- You soft little--
- What? Why is that soft?

07:14.574 --> 07:16.525
Got to go right--
got to go into

07:16.559 --> 07:18.693
The most easy of existences.

07:18.728 --> 07:20.328
But it was cool.
I love the Jetsons.

07:20.363 --> 07:22.497
What about you, Bry?

07:22.532 --> 07:24.933
I think I would go Smurfs.

07:24.967 --> 07:26.067
I don't know
if you'd pull it off

07:26.085 --> 07:27.085
And get away from Gargamel
the way you--

07:27.119 --> 07:28.703
What, so I look like a smurf?
- Yeah.

07:28.738 --> 07:30.505
Like, lazy smurf is like,

07:30.539 --> 07:32.841
"Well, great, what do I do
now that he showed up?"

07:32.875 --> 07:35.710
[laughter]

07:39.315 --> 07:40.982
- Hey, how you doin'?
- Hey, guys.

07:41.017 --> 07:42.484
I found these cards
from when I was a kid.

07:42.518 --> 07:44.186
- Remember garbage pail kid cards?
- Yeah.

07:44.220 --> 07:46.388
I figured maybe
they're worth something.

07:46.422 --> 07:48.490
You guys can
take a look at 'em?

07:56.132 --> 07:58.433
- These are insane.
- Yeah.

07:58.467 --> 07:59.718
These are, like,
for lunatics.

07:59.769 --> 08:01.136
What kind of
a mental patient

08:01.170 --> 08:03.438
Would want to collect these?

08:03.472 --> 08:05.240
- I think me.
- Oh, sorry.

08:05.274 --> 08:07.225
These were hot
for a little bit, though.

08:07.276 --> 08:09.127
Like, I didn't collect these,
but I went out and bought, like,

08:09.178 --> 08:10.912
Five packs just to be
like the other kids,

08:10.947 --> 08:12.214
'cause everybody had 'em.

08:12.248 --> 08:13.398
What about your parents?

08:13.432 --> 08:14.883
What'd they say
when you brought that home?

08:14.917 --> 08:16.718
I didn't really show them.
Hid 'em under my bed.

08:16.752 --> 08:19.354
I would've taken you
right to a psychologist.

08:19.388 --> 08:20.755
Walt had no interest
in these cards.

08:20.790 --> 08:22.624
You were clearly
repulsed by them.

08:22.658 --> 08:24.326
Yeah, I just don't dig 'em.

08:24.360 --> 08:25.827
They were huge
when I was a kid.

08:25.861 --> 08:26.845
And they were
kind of, like,

08:26.896 --> 08:28.463
What came after
"the wacky packages."

08:28.497 --> 08:30.565
Take something
everyone knows--

08:30.600 --> 08:32.299
In this case,
the cabbage patch kids.

08:32.335 --> 08:33.400
Yes.

08:33.419 --> 08:34.803
And then make
satiric versions of them.

08:34.837 --> 08:38.139
Not even satiric,
but almost disturbing.

08:38.174 --> 08:40.140
- Like grotesque.
- Yeah, the had a lot of

08:40.176 --> 08:42.027
Puke jokes,
a lot of bathroom jokes.

08:42.078 --> 08:43.578
- It was great.
- Mangy Ming,

08:43.613 --> 08:47.148
With fleas all over him.
[laughter]

08:47.183 --> 08:49.918
Look at that stuff.
You know what?

08:49.952 --> 08:51.970
They were the brainchild
of Art Spiegelman.

08:52.004 --> 08:53.888
- Okay, I recognize the name.
- You're kidding me.

08:53.923 --> 08:55.757
The same Art Spiegelman
who did Maus?

08:55.791 --> 08:57.359
- Yes.
- That's crazy.

08:57.393 --> 08:59.661
Think about it, the same guy

08:59.679 --> 09:01.930
Who was involved
with one-eyed jack,

09:01.964 --> 09:04.215
A cyclops with a diaper on,

09:04.250 --> 09:07.135
Goes on to win a Pulitzer
for Maus.

09:07.169 --> 09:09.904
Maus is one of the seminal
comic book works

09:09.922 --> 09:12.240
That's transcended
the medium.

09:12.258 --> 09:14.693
It's considered a classic
of literature.

09:14.744 --> 09:17.345
It was Art Spiegelman's
account of the holocaust

09:17.380 --> 09:19.281
Done with mice
and cats.

09:19.315 --> 09:20.515
Really moving piece of work.

09:20.549 --> 09:22.917
But this was the guy
who came from--

09:22.952 --> 09:25.687
- Who came from patty pukeface.
- Yes.

09:25.721 --> 09:26.988
Can you imagine,
he must be sitting there going,

09:27.022 --> 09:28.073
"what am I doing
with my life?"

09:28.124 --> 09:30.191
And then finally,
he does the great work.

09:30.226 --> 09:31.893
What were you looking
for these?

09:31.927 --> 09:36.798
- Maybe 30 bucks?
- Uh...

09:36.832 --> 09:38.700
- You seem to dig 'em.
- Yeah.

09:38.718 --> 09:40.201
Take 30 bucks
out of your pocket.

09:40.219 --> 09:43.738
I mean, they're a very small
piece of my childhood.

09:43.773 --> 09:45.557
I obviously don't have mine
anymore--I chucked 'em.

09:45.608 --> 09:48.827
- Would you take $10 for them?
- Maybe meet in the middle.

09:48.861 --> 09:51.680
- Like, 20?
- 10 is the highest I can go.

09:51.714 --> 09:54.249
All right, how 'bout $15?

09:54.283 --> 09:55.400
Still, I'll give you
ten bucks for them

09:55.434 --> 09:58.536
If you want to unload them
right now.

09:58.571 --> 10:00.121
Cash.

10:00.156 --> 10:01.556
- All right.
- Yeah?

10:01.590 --> 10:02.874
Can I have ten bucks?

10:02.908 --> 10:03.875
I'm not giving you
out of the register.

10:03.909 --> 10:08.179
- I'll pay you back.
- Yeah.

10:08.230 --> 10:10.432
- There you go.
- All right, thanks, guys.

10:10.466 --> 10:12.634
- Thanks, mike.
- See you later.

10:12.668 --> 10:14.035
What are you gonna do
with these?

10:14.070 --> 10:16.571
I don't know.
They're a piece of my childhood.

10:16.605 --> 10:18.473
Like, I had 'em once before.
I lost 'em.

10:18.507 --> 10:19.507
So were the chicken pox.

10:19.525 --> 10:21.343
- You want that back too?
- No.

10:21.377 --> 10:22.777
You know I'm gonna tell
your wife to check underneath

10:22.811 --> 10:24.979
The mattress, though,
for garbage pail kids.

10:25.014 --> 10:27.599
I mean, if that's the worst
that she finds, then--

10:27.633 --> 10:31.219
- Oh, my God.
- [laughs]

10:31.253 --> 10:33.722
What's up
with the costumes?

10:33.756 --> 10:34.923
Um...

10:34.957 --> 10:36.441
Did you not know
you were wearing costumes?

10:36.492 --> 10:38.860
- Why do you have to look down?
- Well, it's, it's--

10:40.738 --> 10:43.557
- I was a huge card collector
when I was a kid,

10:43.591 --> 10:45.542
But not sports cards.

10:45.576 --> 10:48.278
Always cards
from shows or movies.

10:48.313 --> 10:51.014
But the weirdest cards
that I think I ever collected

10:51.049 --> 10:52.983
Were Jaws II cards.

10:53.017 --> 10:56.586
And they were depictions
of people getting eaten

10:56.621 --> 10:58.322
By a shark on the card.
[laughter]

10:58.356 --> 11:00.690
I love trading cards.
I had 'em all.

11:00.708 --> 11:02.743
I had Planet of the Apes
the TV series...

11:02.777 --> 11:04.995
- I remember those.
- King Kong from '77;

11:05.029 --> 11:07.748
Welcome back, Kotter.
Charlie's Angels--

11:07.799 --> 11:11.034
Welcome back, Kotter
got cards, man.

11:11.068 --> 11:13.136
- What about you, Zap?
- Remember tasty bread?

11:13.171 --> 11:15.088
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- They had D.C. Comics stickers

11:15.139 --> 11:17.741
- In them.
- Oh, I remember this!

11:17.759 --> 11:19.876
And I used to undo
the twist tie,

11:19.894 --> 11:23.497
Slide your hand down there,
grab the sticker, put it--

11:23.531 --> 11:26.350
- Grimy kid hands
all over your bread.

11:26.384 --> 11:28.352
Mike's the reason
they invented the safety seal.

11:28.386 --> 11:30.454
What happened, man?
Why are today's kids--

11:30.488 --> 11:31.872
They're not interested
in a sticker

11:31.906 --> 11:33.490
In a loaf of bread
anymore?

11:33.524 --> 11:35.008
I don't know if a sticker's
gonna capture the imagination

11:35.043 --> 11:36.093
Of a kid who can be like,

11:36.127 --> 11:38.295
"you know what I saw
on the internet?

11:38.329 --> 11:39.763
A guy having sex
with three horses."

11:39.797 --> 11:45.268
[laughter]

11:56.970 --> 11:58.504
Hey, you know
what I was thinking?

11:58.538 --> 12:04.143
Could 007, James Bond,
take down a superhero?

12:04.177 --> 12:06.345
'cause I just saw
the latest Bond movie,

12:06.379 --> 12:09.248
And this new Bond
ain't your daddy's Bond, Mike.

12:09.282 --> 12:10.983
He's not Roger Moore
in his depends.

12:11.017 --> 12:14.319
- This Bond is badass.
- Okay.

12:14.354 --> 12:15.771
You can't be serious though.
He's got no powers.

12:15.805 --> 12:17.189
Neither does green arrow.

12:17.223 --> 12:19.942
His whole arsenal's
just gadgets that q gives him.

12:19.976 --> 12:21.894
- Batman.
- Thank you.

12:21.928 --> 12:24.129
You're telling me
he can take down superheroes?

12:24.164 --> 12:26.165
I think he can.
This Bond can.

12:26.199 --> 12:29.134
Ming, your Bond
is Roger Moore, right?

12:29.169 --> 12:30.569
- Yes.
- The leisure suit-wearing,

12:30.603 --> 12:32.805
Not-having-sex Bond.

12:32.839 --> 12:33.906
Oh, I thought
all the Bonds have sex.

12:33.940 --> 12:35.624
- Yeah.
- Yeah, even Roger Moore.

12:35.658 --> 12:38.210
That's also what I dig
about all the Bonds is that

12:38.244 --> 12:41.814
If it walks and has a skirt on,
Bond has conquered it.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.215
That would be
his weakness, then.

12:43.249 --> 12:45.117
Why is it his weakness?

12:45.151 --> 12:47.870
He's not focused
on his duties.

12:47.904 --> 12:51.707
Only you would consider
a chick's private parts

12:51.741 --> 12:53.809
A weakness.
- [laughs]

12:53.843 --> 12:55.728
- You are highly suspect, Ming.
- Not what I meant.

12:55.762 --> 13:00.532
You are ruining the machismo
of this Bond conversation.

13:00.567 --> 13:02.401
[laughter]

13:06.206 --> 13:07.473
Hi.

13:07.507 --> 13:09.224
- How you doin'?
- I have a question.

13:09.275 --> 13:10.476
- Okay.
- So do I.

13:10.510 --> 13:14.012
- What's up with the costumes?
- Um...

13:14.047 --> 13:15.280
Did you not know
you were wearing costumes?

13:15.298 --> 13:17.015
- Why do you have to look down?
- We did. We did.

13:17.050 --> 13:20.519
I have to check and remember
which one I'm wearing today.

13:20.553 --> 13:21.920
What's that costume from?

13:21.955 --> 13:25.257
I call it
"the demented stewardess."

13:25.291 --> 13:28.694
- It's a Doctor Who thing.
- Doctor Who, yeah.

13:28.728 --> 13:30.095
I just made it the other day,

13:30.113 --> 13:32.197
And I'm sort of doing it
for a test run

13:32.215 --> 13:34.833
Because I'm taking this with me
to Comic-Con this year.

13:34.868 --> 13:37.736
You know what is the most
maddening thing on Earth?

13:37.771 --> 13:39.505
These two seem happier
than I do.

13:39.539 --> 13:42.458
- [laughter]
- I don't get it, man.

13:42.492 --> 13:46.145
How much would it cost you
to design my buddy here

13:46.179 --> 13:48.080
A dress like that,
and a hat?

13:48.114 --> 13:49.465
Why can't I go as a dude?
Why do I have to--

13:49.499 --> 13:50.849
Well, I thought,
I thought--

13:50.884 --> 13:53.118
- I can make a male version
of the tardis.

13:53.153 --> 13:54.686
I could do that.
All you need is--

13:54.721 --> 13:58.257
- I don't think that's
what's going to do it for me.

13:58.291 --> 13:59.541
All right, men,
you're going to a con

13:59.576 --> 14:00.959
And you have to cosplay.

14:00.994 --> 14:03.662
Who you guys gonna go as?
You.

14:03.696 --> 14:05.330
Silent bob.

14:05.365 --> 14:07.099
[laughter]
- nice.

14:07.133 --> 14:09.001
How about you, Zap?
Who would you be at a con?

14:09.035 --> 14:10.586
I'd want to be
a Death Trooper--

14:10.637 --> 14:12.938
One of the Stormtroopers
dressed all in black.

14:12.972 --> 14:15.273
Nice, man.
What about you, Ming?

14:15.291 --> 14:16.909
The one I love
seeing at cons is Frank,

14:16.943 --> 14:18.293
The rabbit
from Donnie Darko.

14:18.328 --> 14:19.578
That one freaks me
the hell out.

14:19.612 --> 14:21.480
Creepy, man.
That's unsettling.

14:21.514 --> 14:23.632
- Uh, Walt?
- Well, it might shock you,

14:23.683 --> 14:25.384
But I'm into that furry too.

14:25.418 --> 14:27.436
- What?
- You know, furries?

14:27.470 --> 14:28.904
The furry movement?
People that dress up

14:28.955 --> 14:30.656
Like stuffed bears
and have sex?

14:30.690 --> 14:32.124
No, no.
That's what that is?

14:32.158 --> 14:34.159
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[laughter]

14:34.194 --> 14:35.911
I was like,
"we got an exclusive, man!"

14:35.962 --> 14:39.231
Walt's like,
"I'm total furry."

14:39.265 --> 14:40.549
All right, what are you guys
doing here today?

14:40.583 --> 14:41.800
What could we help you with?

14:41.835 --> 14:43.301
I've gotten too many people
telling me

14:43.319 --> 14:45.154
I need to read Deadpool,
so do you have, maybe,

14:45.188 --> 14:47.039
Like, a one-shot comic of that
I can pick up?

14:47.073 --> 14:48.223
You know what?
Let me grab it.

14:48.258 --> 14:50.776
- Bry, I'll be right back.
- All right.

14:50.810 --> 14:52.077
I love Deadpool.

14:52.111 --> 14:55.347
Do you guys ever talk about
non-geeky, dorky stuff?

14:55.365 --> 14:57.883
Like, do you ever talk about
real things and real life?

14:57.917 --> 15:00.085
"Normal" is only a setting
on a washing machine.

15:00.119 --> 15:02.821
Wow, do you have any other
slogans from, like, hot topic

15:02.856 --> 15:05.858
You want to bust on me or...
[laughter]

15:05.892 --> 15:07.843
Ah, here we go:

15:07.894 --> 15:10.596
Deadpool kills
the Marvel Universe,

15:10.630 --> 15:12.998
Issue 1 and issue 2.

15:20.173 --> 15:21.473
- What do you think, these two?
- Sure.

15:21.507 --> 15:25.844
All right, $5.98.

15:25.879 --> 15:27.712
- $14. Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

15:27.730 --> 15:29.398
- Enjoy it.
- Thanks.

15:29.432 --> 15:31.600
And, yeah, bring back
that Tardis costume

15:31.651 --> 15:32.951
For my buddy here.

15:32.986 --> 15:34.786
What's your waist size?
I can get you a nice--

15:34.821 --> 15:35.871
- I don't know my waist size.

15:35.905 --> 15:36.989
My boobs are about
as big as yours though,

15:37.023 --> 15:39.124
So you can go the same.
[laughter]

15:39.158 --> 15:41.143
All right.
All right, thanks, guys.

15:41.177 --> 15:43.629
- Thank you guys so much.
- All right, have a good day.

15:43.663 --> 15:45.364
This one and this one
were both going, actually,

15:45.398 --> 15:47.699
About $200 apiece.

15:47.734 --> 15:49.735
Not anymore.

16:01.318 --> 16:03.185
Ah!

16:03.219 --> 16:06.021
- Ha ha!
- What's up?

16:06.056 --> 16:08.257
Somebody took all the money
out of the register.

16:08.291 --> 16:09.959
[laughter]

16:09.993 --> 16:12.127
What's the occasion, man?
I haven't seen this in a bit.

16:12.162 --> 16:13.929
Yeah, u know,
it's been down in the basement

16:13.947 --> 16:15.731
For so long,
I finally said,

16:15.749 --> 16:17.099
"you know what?
Bring it back upstairs."

16:17.133 --> 16:18.884
I know when we first
had it in the store,

16:18.919 --> 16:20.402
It was keeping us
from doing some work.

16:20.437 --> 16:23.439
- Not like now?
- I figure, you know,

16:23.473 --> 16:24.573
We've got time
for a quick game, right?

16:24.608 --> 16:26.125
- Sure.
- Let's go.

16:26.159 --> 16:28.911
- You any good at this?
- I don't know.

16:28.945 --> 16:31.780
I'm not really that great
at sports.

16:31.815 --> 16:34.083
Flicking your wrist,
I don't know, is a sport.

16:34.117 --> 16:36.652
'cause if it was,
ming would be a gold medalist.

16:36.686 --> 16:40.789
- [laughter]
- He'd be meeting the president.

16:40.824 --> 16:42.257
- All right, you ready?
- Yeah.

16:42.292 --> 16:44.259
Go.

16:46.363 --> 16:48.497
Come on, Mike. Oh. Oh.

16:48.531 --> 16:49.965
Ooooh!

16:49.983 --> 16:51.784
You can't do that.
It's off-kilter.

16:51.818 --> 16:54.470
- I noticed, man.
- Oh!

16:54.504 --> 16:55.471
That wasn't going nowhere.

16:55.505 --> 16:58.941
- Oh, yeah!
- So lucky.

17:01.878 --> 17:04.646
- Yeah!
- Ooh!

17:04.681 --> 17:06.781
[laughter, chatter]

17:06.816 --> 17:10.219
Get it out of there.
What did you do this time?

17:11.554 --> 17:14.857
Come on, hit it out.

17:14.891 --> 17:17.126
Oh!

17:17.160 --> 17:19.994
- Are you throwing this game?
- No!

17:20.030 --> 17:22.131
This game sucks.
- [laughs]

17:22.165 --> 17:26.835
One more, son.
Game point.

17:26.869 --> 17:29.371
Oh!

17:29.406 --> 17:32.241
Oh, that was almost
your dignity right there.

17:32.275 --> 17:33.776
[laughs]

17:33.810 --> 17:36.095
- Oh!
- Whoo!

17:36.129 --> 17:38.147
[laughter]

17:38.181 --> 17:39.598
I think he threw
the game, mike.

17:39.632 --> 17:42.651
I know he did.

17:45.655 --> 17:47.189
- Hi.
- Hi, how you doing?

17:47.223 --> 17:49.224
Good. How are you?
I have a--

17:49.259 --> 17:51.560
- Let me just get back here.
- What do you got?

17:51.594 --> 17:53.662
A few things you might be
interested in here, hopefully.

17:53.680 --> 17:57.833
Some Marvel legends
and one icon.

17:57.867 --> 17:59.018
- You remember these?
- Oh, yeah.

17:59.052 --> 18:00.636
Did you have them
here in the store?

18:00.670 --> 18:02.438
We did. This is one
we couldn't keep on the shelves.

18:02.472 --> 18:04.506
That, actually,
is a variant of the original,

18:04.541 --> 18:06.008
Because he has the mask on.

18:06.042 --> 18:07.843
Right. The mask was off
in the original.

18:07.877 --> 18:10.112
Other than that, I have
Captain America, series one.

18:10.130 --> 18:12.081
We also have two more
of the Avengers--

18:12.115 --> 18:13.482
The Hulk, and Iron Man.

18:20.123 --> 18:21.957
Actually, I want Walt
to take a look at these.

18:21.991 --> 18:24.059
Because I'm not really sure
of the pricing.

18:24.094 --> 18:26.562
- Hey, walt?
- Yes.

18:26.596 --> 18:27.696
Do you have a minute
to check out.

18:27.731 --> 18:29.398
These fine legends figures

18:29.432 --> 18:31.266
That this gentleman
wants to sell?

18:31.284 --> 18:32.334
Absolutely.

18:32.368 --> 18:34.369
About 10, 12 years ago,

18:34.404 --> 18:36.872
Everybody, it seemed like,
was buying action figures.

18:36.906 --> 18:37.856
Yeah.

18:37.891 --> 18:39.358
And the Marvel legends.

18:39.392 --> 18:41.577
Were one of the premier
toy lines.

18:41.611 --> 18:42.828
The prices that were
being bandied about

18:42.862 --> 18:44.329
For these figures were crazy.

18:44.380 --> 18:46.381
I mean, you had figures
that were just being released

18:46.416 --> 18:48.050
Fetching hundreds of dollars.

18:48.084 --> 18:49.752
Because a lot of them
were chase figures as well.

18:49.786 --> 18:52.137
To see it on the rack,
you almost couldn't believe it.

18:52.188 --> 18:53.722
You had to slap yourself
across the face and go,

18:53.757 --> 18:55.124
"is that really
sitting there?

18:55.158 --> 18:56.558
"is that really
on the pegs right now?

18:56.593 --> 18:59.595
Pinch me."
[laughter]

18:59.629 --> 19:02.364
They've been sitting in bins
for the last ten years.

19:02.398 --> 19:04.466
I bought 'em
in anticipation of kids...

19:04.501 --> 19:06.401
[chuckles]
and had a kid,

19:06.436 --> 19:08.837
And she is more interested
in horses

19:08.872 --> 19:10.405
Than action figures, so...

19:10.439 --> 19:11.840
So you looking
to move 'em today?

19:11.875 --> 19:13.074
Yeah, hopefully.

19:13.093 --> 19:14.426
It's too bad
that you didn't know

19:14.461 --> 19:18.781
Your daughter didn't like these
in 2005, 2006,

19:18.815 --> 19:21.316
When they were getting--
fetching a premium.

19:21.351 --> 19:22.684
We've looked them up
recently.

19:22.719 --> 19:24.853
Actually, there were--
two of the variants,

19:24.888 --> 19:26.822
This one and this one,
were both going, actually,

19:26.840 --> 19:28.423
About $200 apiece.

19:28.458 --> 19:29.708
$200?

19:29.759 --> 19:31.460
- Not anymore.
- Yeah.

19:31.494 --> 19:32.678
It's not going for $200.

19:32.712 --> 19:34.546
I mean, if you do
a little more investigation,

19:34.581 --> 19:36.865
Maybe some of
the online auction sites,

19:36.883 --> 19:39.601
You'll see that I could get them
relatively cheap now.

19:39.636 --> 19:43.505
Maybe not the gold Iron Man,
but Mr. F and Namor--

19:43.540 --> 19:45.073
Ten bucks each, probably,
you could get for 'em now.

19:45.108 --> 19:46.375
Really?

19:46.409 --> 19:49.728
$150 is the best
I could do today.

19:49.762 --> 19:52.047
Yeah, I mean, what else
were you gonna do with 'em?

19:52.081 --> 19:53.549
The kid doesn't want 'em.

19:53.583 --> 19:55.551
They're just gonna sit there
for another ten years.

19:55.585 --> 19:58.787
Right.

19:58.822 --> 20:00.656
You couldn't do any more?

20:00.690 --> 20:01.990
- I couldn't.
- Not at all?

20:02.025 --> 20:05.194
$150? That's...

20:09.365 --> 20:13.635
Uh... Yeah, I guess,
if that's your top price.

20:13.670 --> 20:18.941
- That's good. Right on.
- Shake on it.

20:18.975 --> 20:21.310
- There you go. $150.
- All right.

20:21.344 --> 20:22.678
Thank you.

20:22.712 --> 20:24.646
- Have a good day.
- You too.

20:24.681 --> 20:26.982
You ever get to a store,
like, super early

20:27.016 --> 20:28.283
And wait for it to open,

20:28.317 --> 20:29.718
But you would see, like,
your rivals

20:29.752 --> 20:31.403
Also sitting
in the parking lot?

20:31.454 --> 20:33.288
I remember, literally,
running to the front door

20:33.323 --> 20:34.723
Trying to beat them.

20:34.757 --> 20:36.191
I would never
just lower myself

20:36.226 --> 20:39.061
To run into the toy aisle
as a grown man.

20:39.095 --> 20:43.031
I would fast-walk.
[laughter]

20:43.066 --> 20:44.299
Well, that's gonna do it

20:44.334 --> 20:46.301
For another episode
of Comic Book Men.

20:46.336 --> 20:47.436
I hate to run out of time.

20:47.470 --> 20:49.471
Unfortunately,
time is our enemy.

20:49.505 --> 20:52.074
Until next week,
I'm your host, Kevin Smith...

20:52.108 --> 20:53.575
- Bryan Johnson...
- Walt Flanagan...

20:53.610 --> 20:55.110
- Mike Zapcic...
- Ming Chen.

20:55.144 --> 20:58.580
See you on yancy street, kids.
Good night.
