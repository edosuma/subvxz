WEBVTT

00:03.583 --> 00:05.574
When I was a little kid,

00:05.583 --> 00:08.074
I used to think ships
were like magic...

00:08.083 --> 00:12.577
sailing in from strange places,
carrying mysterious cargo...

00:12.583 --> 00:16.576
This ship was from
the People's Republic of China,

00:16.583 --> 00:20.075
and the cargo was
kind of special:

00:20.083 --> 00:23.075
a single treasure
literally beyond price.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.081
It'd been on display
during the voyage,

00:26.625 --> 00:29.082
and its security
had been the responsibility

00:29.083 --> 00:31.074
of the Chinese government.

00:31.083 --> 00:35.622
Now it was going to be ours:
Pete Thornton's and mine.

00:39.625 --> 00:41.081
Chu.

00:41.083 --> 00:43.119
I mean,
Commissioner Chu.

00:43.125 --> 00:45.116
Don't be inscrutable
with me, Peter.

00:45.625 --> 00:47.115
It's good to see you again.

00:47.125 --> 00:49.116
And very good to see you

00:49.125 --> 00:50.114
I'd like to introduce

00:50.625 --> 00:52.115
my friend and
colleague, MacGyver.

00:52.125 --> 00:55.617
(speaking Mandarin)

00:56.125 --> 00:57.114
The honor is mine.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.616
You speak Mandarin.

00:59.625 --> 01:01.616
You just heard about 90o/o of it.

01:02.125 --> 01:06.118
May I ask what you do
for the Phoenix organiyation?

01:06.125 --> 01:09.117
Well, MacGyver is a kind
of, uh, troubleshooter.

01:09.125 --> 01:11.662
I trust
we're not expecting trouble.

01:11.667 --> 01:13.658
You know me...
belt and suspenders...

01:13.667 --> 01:15.658
We figured
we'd be better off

01:16.125 --> 01:17.661
a little nervous
than a lot sorry.

01:18.667 --> 01:21.659
Actually, I'm pleased.

01:21.667 --> 01:25.159
Now, if you'll sign the manifest
receiving the item...

01:25.166 --> 01:26.656
Item?

01:26.667 --> 01:28.658
That's some description
for a national treasure,

01:29.166 --> 01:30.155
but, uh, on behalf

01:30.667 --> 01:32.157
of the International
Cultural Exposition...

01:32.667 --> 01:34.157
Uh, maybe...

01:34.166 --> 01:36.157
after we see the dragon?

01:36.166 --> 01:39.158
Troubleshooter and lawyer.

01:39.166 --> 01:41.657
No, just curious
to see a legend.

01:42.166 --> 01:43.155
And you shall.

01:43.709 --> 01:45.165
(speaking Mandarin)

01:49.166 --> 01:53.159
This is the first time it's been
outside of China, isn't it?

01:53.709 --> 01:55.165
That's why I'm being
very careful.

01:59.166 --> 02:00.702
The Ming Dragon.

02:02.166 --> 02:06.205
China is very proud of it
as a work of art...

02:06.208 --> 02:08.199
and part of our history.

02:08.709 --> 02:09.698
It's beautiful.

02:15.709 --> 02:18.200
Hey!

02:18.208 --> 02:19.698
This is a restricted area, Miss.

02:19.709 --> 02:21.199
May I ask
what you're doing here?

02:21.208 --> 02:25.201
Excuse me.
I was invited to a party.

02:26.750 --> 02:27.739
There's no party.

02:28.208 --> 02:30.745
Then let's have one of our own.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:12.333 --> 04:15.325
Well, hello, little one.

04:15.333 --> 04:17.324
Yes.

04:17.333 --> 04:19.324
Do you have something for me?

04:30.333 --> 04:32.870
Well, Nicolai?

04:32.875 --> 04:34.866
The dragon has arrived.

04:34.875 --> 04:38.322
Security will be handled
as we expected?

04:38.333 --> 04:41.325
By the Phoenix Foundat
ion and MacGyver.

04:41.333 --> 04:43.369
I see you remember him...

04:43.375 --> 04:45.866
the time you failed
to catch him.

04:45.875 --> 04:47.866
I remember.

04:47.875 --> 04:50.867
Hmm. If it's
any consolation to you...

04:50.875 --> 04:52.866
before we leave,

04:52.875 --> 04:54.365
MacGyver will be dead.

05:52.417 --> 05:56.410
The exhibit will be in this
hall under absolute security.

05:56.959 --> 05:58.415
Pettigrew here set it up.

05:58.417 --> 05:59.953
The Ming Dragon
will be protected

05:59.959 --> 06:02.416
by this case
of shatterproof glass,

06:02.417 --> 06:04.453
cushioned
by this pressure plate

06:04.458 --> 06:05.948
and locked into place.

06:06.959 --> 06:08.950
Well, what about alarms?

06:09.458 --> 06:11.949
Embedded in all the glass.

06:11.959 --> 06:16.953
And a laser system...
forms a barrier around it all.

06:16.959 --> 06:18.950
Any intruder will be stopped
immediately.

06:18.959 --> 06:21.951
What about surveillance
cameras, Mr. Pettigrew?

06:21.959 --> 06:23.995
They can be defeated
too easily.

06:24.001 --> 06:25.992
Besides, this system
is sophisticated,

06:26.001 --> 06:27.457
state of the art.

06:27.458 --> 06:29.449
Your dragon will be safe,
Mr. Chu.

06:30.001 --> 06:34.449
Is it truly safe,
uh, Mr. MacGyver?

06:35.001 --> 06:36.992
Well, why don't we take
a good look

06:37.001 --> 06:37.990
at what we have here.

06:38.458 --> 06:39.994
You want to turn on
the laser network

06:40.001 --> 06:41.457
and dim the lights
a little bit?

06:41.458 --> 06:43.494
Oh, certainly.
Uh, gentlemen?

06:43.500 --> 06:46.492
Uh, this is Pettigrew,
Security Control.

06:46.500 --> 06:47.489
Lower the house lights

06:47.500 --> 06:50.992
and, uh, activate
the laser shield.

06:51.500 --> 06:52.990
There you are.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.491
Now, the guards will be where?

06:58.500 --> 06:59.990
In, uh, Central Control,

07:00.001 --> 07:01.491
but any intruder
will break the beams

07:02.001 --> 07:02.990
and set off the alarms.

07:03.001 --> 07:05.993
Well, maybe. Maybe not.

07:06.000 --> 07:06.989
Well, they can't evade
the beams.

07:07.500 --> 07:07.989
They can't see them.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.991
They can now.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.991
Very imaginative.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.490
See, there's a couple
of ways to handle

07:18.000 --> 07:19.991
a light beam alarm system.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.993
You can divert the ray
through optic fiber...

07:24.000 --> 07:26.537
use a mirror to deflect it...

07:29.542 --> 07:34.536
...but about the easiest thing
to do is just, uh... avoid it.

07:34.542 --> 07:36.999
Now, while the guards
are kicking back having coffee

07:37.000 --> 07:42.996
or whatever they do, I've gotten
in and no alarm has gone off.

07:58.041 --> 07:59.531
What it comes to is this:

07:59.542 --> 08:02.534
by the time
anybody shows up here,

08:02.542 --> 08:05.579
I'll be long gone...
with the dragon.

08:05.583 --> 08:07.039
Well...

08:07.041 --> 08:08.577
I just don't know
what to say.

08:08.583 --> 08:10.574
Well, don't worry.
That's why we're here.

08:10.583 --> 08:12.039
Now we know what to fix.

08:12.041 --> 08:15.033
First, replace that key lock
with a combination.

08:15.041 --> 08:17.032
Yeah. And set up
regular guard inspections,

08:17.583 --> 08:20.040
say, no more
than ten minutes apart.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.578
And, you know,
it might not be a bad idea

08:23.041 --> 08:25.578
to wire an alarm
into this pressure plate here

08:25.583 --> 08:28.575
where the glass fits,
so if anybody does lift it...

08:29.083 --> 08:30.072
We'd have another alarm.

08:30.083 --> 08:32.573
I'll get right on it.

08:33.082 --> 08:34.573
I think I am
rather glad

08:34.582 --> 08:37.073
you are on the
job, Mr. MacGyver.

08:37.082 --> 08:39.073
My pleasure, sir.

08:39.082 --> 08:42.075
I confess of
being unsettled.

08:42.582 --> 08:45.620
This, and the-the death
of that security guard.

08:46.083 --> 08:47.072
Yeah, I know;
that bothers me, too,

08:47.625 --> 08:48.614
but it's being looked into.

08:48.625 --> 08:49.614
So far, there's no evidence

08:50.083 --> 08:52.074
to indicate anything
but an accident.

08:56.625 --> 09:02.074
The Ming Dragon
is our national treasure.

09:02.083 --> 09:07.123
And while it is here,
your national responsibility.

09:07.125 --> 09:09.616
If anything were to happen...

09:10.125 --> 09:12.616
the result
could be quite serious.

09:18.625 --> 09:19.614
So, you think Pettigrew

09:19.625 --> 09:21.115
will be able
to make all those changes

09:21.125 --> 09:22.615
before the opening
day after tomorrow?

09:22.625 --> 09:24.661
Yeah, we should have
most of it locked down

09:24.667 --> 09:26.658
by tomorrow afternoon's
VIP reception.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.123
All except the pressure
plate alarm, that is.

09:28.125 --> 09:29.661
That's being shipped
out of New York.

09:29.667 --> 09:30.656
When does that get here?

09:30.667 --> 09:32.123
Sometime tomorrow evening.

09:32.125 --> 09:34.116
It's going to mean
an all-night effort
to get it installed,

09:34.125 --> 09:35.661
but at least it'll
be done for the opening.

09:36.125 --> 09:38.116
By the way, I w...

09:39.125 --> 09:40.661
Are you listening to me?

09:40.667 --> 09:42.658
Yeah, I'm sorry, Pete.

09:42.667 --> 09:44.658
I thought I saw somebody.

09:46.667 --> 09:48.658
Well, you said
you saw someone. Who?

09:48.667 --> 09:53.161
Well, I thought
it was...

09:53.166 --> 09:54.656
Nope, forget it.

09:54.667 --> 09:56.157
A mistake. Come on.

09:56.166 --> 09:57.656
What do you mean, "come on"?

09:57.667 --> 09:58.656
The elevators are over here.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.157
I know, but I got a surprise
for you over here.

10:01.667 --> 10:02.656
Come on.

10:08.166 --> 10:09.702
The Great Sheldrake?

10:10.166 --> 10:11.702
Who's he?

10:11.709 --> 10:15.156
That's the surprise.

10:15.709 --> 10:16.698
And then the announcer's voice

10:17.166 --> 10:18.702
says, "Ladies and gentlemen,
presenting your guru

10:19.166 --> 10:20.155
into the unknown,

10:20.166 --> 10:22.703
"the master of miracles,"
the Great Sheldrake!

10:22.709 --> 10:25.701
Applause, applause, applause,
alakayam, one, two, three...

10:26.208 --> 10:27.698
hit it!

10:35.709 --> 10:38.200
We have to cut way back
on that smoke.

10:38.208 --> 10:39.197
Jack Dalton?!

10:39.208 --> 10:41.199
What's he
doing here?

10:41.208 --> 10:44.200
Now, I bring on
my lovely assistant, Loretta...

10:46.208 --> 10:47.197
That's you, babe.

10:47.750 --> 10:50.742
Come on. Come on.
We open tonight.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.206
Curtsy.

10:52.750 --> 10:54.741
Rise!

10:56.750 --> 10:59.742
Rise!

11:03.750 --> 11:05.741
Hey, excuse me.

11:06.250 --> 11:07.740
Excuse me.
This is a closed rehearsal.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.240
Oh, like the time
you tried

11:09.250 --> 11:11.741
to pull a silk scarf
out of the principal's ear

11:11.750 --> 11:13.240
and got his toupee
instead?

11:13.250 --> 11:15.741
MacGyver! Pete!

11:17.750 --> 11:19.741
Hey, great
to see you guys!

11:19.750 --> 11:21.240
What a surprise!

11:21.250 --> 11:23.787
You heard I was appearing,
you came to see me. Terrific!

11:24.250 --> 11:25.786
Since when are you a,
uh, magician?

11:25.792 --> 11:27.248
When?

11:27.250 --> 11:29.787
I have studied
at the feet of Hindu mystics,

11:29.792 --> 11:32.249
climbed the hidden mountains
of Tibet

11:32.250 --> 11:35.242
to learn the lost secrets
of that unknown kingdom.

11:35.250 --> 11:36.239
I have delved into...

11:36.250 --> 11:37.786
A magic course he got

11:37.792 --> 11:39.783
selling magayines
in the tenth grade.

11:40.250 --> 11:41.786
A correspondence course.

11:41.792 --> 11:43.248
A mail-order
Mandrake, huh?

11:43.250 --> 11:44.285
No.

11:44.291 --> 11:45.781
A mail-order Sheldrake.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.282
Come to the opening tonight,
and I'll show you

11:47.792 --> 11:49.282
the most magnificent magic act
you've ever seen.

11:50.792 --> 11:52.282
Thank you, one and all

11:52.291 --> 11:53.781
for joining The Great Sheldrake

11:53.792 --> 11:56.283
on this magic carpet ride
into that shadowed land

11:56.291 --> 11:59.783
where reality and illusion
intermingle.

11:59.792 --> 12:02.283
A place where the mysteries
of time, space,

12:02.291 --> 12:04.282
and the journey of souls
are held

12:04.291 --> 12:05.827
in the firm grasp
of darkness.

12:06.291 --> 12:11.285
A depth of infinite knowledge,
shared with you alone.

12:14.291 --> 12:15.827
And so,
until our late, late show,

12:15.834 --> 12:17.290
that's it, ladies and gentlemen.

12:17.291 --> 12:20.283
Enjoy the music,
have a drink, spend a buck.

12:29.333 --> 12:31.824
Come on, Loretta.
You're stepping on my cues.

12:31.834 --> 12:34.325
This is supposed to be magic,
not "who's on first? "

12:34.333 --> 12:36.324
Jack! Hey, that's terrific.

12:36.333 --> 12:38.324
You really know how
to do this stuff.

12:38.333 --> 12:39.823
Hey, what can I say?
It's a gift.

12:39.834 --> 12:41.324
Some of us have it.
Thanks for coming.

12:41.333 --> 12:43.324
But enough about me.
What are you doing in town?

12:43.333 --> 12:45.324
International
Cultural Exposition.

12:45.333 --> 12:46.322
Ah!

12:46.333 --> 12:47.869
East meets west.

12:48.333 --> 12:49.322
Great parties!

12:49.333 --> 12:50.869
Oh, they're the worst.

12:51.333 --> 12:52.869
There's one tomorrow at noon,
Thursday evening,

12:52.875 --> 12:53.864
dinner on Friday... I hate it.

12:54.333 --> 12:54.867
I'll come tomorrow.

12:55.333 --> 12:57.324
Jack...
No, not a word.

12:57.333 --> 12:58.322
No groveling gratitude.

12:58.875 --> 13:00.866
Besides, I might make
some valuable contacts.

13:00.875 --> 13:01.864
Come on.
I'll buy you a carrot juice.

13:01.875 --> 13:04.366
Geey...

13:10.875 --> 13:13.366
What is it?

13:13.375 --> 13:14.865
Lisa.

13:23.375 --> 13:25.912
Mac!

13:29.375 --> 13:31.366
Who'd you see?

13:31.917 --> 13:33.373
Lisa.

13:33.375 --> 13:34.364
Lisa who?

13:36.917 --> 13:39.909
A girl I knew once...
Lisa Kohler.

13:39.917 --> 13:41.908
But she's dead.

13:41.917 --> 13:44.909
At least,
I thought she was.

13:44.917 --> 13:46.908
This girl looked
exactly like her.

13:46.917 --> 13:48.908
Maybe she's alive.

13:48.917 --> 13:51.909
No. I saw her die.

13:56.417 --> 13:58.408
I killed her.

14:07.417 --> 14:09.408
Okay. Thanks for checking.

14:09.959 --> 14:12.416
Straight ginger ale,
but I made it a double.

14:12.959 --> 14:13.948
Anything?

14:14.417 --> 14:16.954
No, she's
not registered
at the hotel.

14:16.959 --> 14:18.950
They'd never
heard the name.

14:20.417 --> 14:21.953
I was wrong.

14:21.959 --> 14:24.951
Okay, but talk to me.

14:24.959 --> 14:26.950
Come on, MacGyver.
You wouldn't step on an ant.

14:26.959 --> 14:28.449
What do you mean,
I killed her?

14:28.458 --> 14:30.949
I did.

14:30.959 --> 14:32.950
I killed her.

14:35.458 --> 14:38.450
Lisa Kohler, two years ago
on the Baltic Coast.

14:41.959 --> 14:42.948
She was my contact

14:42.959 --> 14:45.450
to an underground
resistance group.

14:45.458 --> 14:48.450
All very official,
all very proper.

14:50.001 --> 14:51.992
And then it got very personal.

14:52.458 --> 14:53.994
The worst time
and the worst place

14:54.458 --> 14:55.994
for falling in love.

14:56.001 --> 14:57.992
But that's exactly
what happened.

14:58.001 --> 15:00.447
Even while we were locked
into a mission

15:00.458 --> 15:02.995
to blow a secret
weapons facility.

15:03.001 --> 15:05.492
I tried to stop Lisa
from coming along,

15:06.001 --> 15:07.491
but she insisted.

15:09.001 --> 15:10.491
She argued
that it was her information

15:10.500 --> 15:11.990
and her job.

15:12.001 --> 15:13.992
The last one, in fact.

15:14.001 --> 15:15.992
I'd arranged
to bring her back home with me.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.491
But first,
we had to complete the mission

15:19.500 --> 15:22.492
by setting explosives
at two separate locations.

15:22.500 --> 15:25.492
It meant
we were both at risk.

15:25.500 --> 15:28.492
It meant I worried a lot.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.991
Listen, one
last time.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.500
Will you let me
handle this?

15:33.500 --> 15:34.489
No.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.490
Your responsibility
is the intake pipe.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.491
My job is sealing the exhaust.

15:38.500 --> 15:39.990
Now...

15:40.500 --> 15:42.491
I'll meet you back at the boat
in three minutes.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.536
Don't worry.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.992
I feel safe
since you gave me this.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.991
I let her go off alone.

16:02.542 --> 16:03.531
I should have gone in with her.

16:04.041 --> 16:05.531
Don't second-gue
ss yourself.

16:07.041 --> 16:09.532
What happened?

16:09.542 --> 16:12.534
The whole plan blew up
in my face.

16:23.041 --> 16:24.577
Wait. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

16:24.583 --> 16:25.572
Where's Lisa?

16:25.583 --> 16:26.572
She's not here yet.
Come on.

16:27.041 --> 16:28.030
We are not
leaving her behind!

16:28.041 --> 16:29.030
She didn't make it.

16:29.041 --> 16:30.030
You know the rules.
Let's go!

16:30.583 --> 16:31.572
Wait. There she is!

16:38.583 --> 16:40.574
Lisa!

16:53.583 --> 16:56.074
No!

17:09.625 --> 17:10.614
You didn't kill her.

17:10.625 --> 17:12.616
Jack, I should have
gone in alone.

17:12.625 --> 17:13.614
One person alone

17:13.625 --> 17:15.616
in that situation has less
a chance of fouling up.

17:16.083 --> 17:17.071
Stop it! Stop it!

17:17.083 --> 17:18.071
It's a lousy piece of fate,

17:18.083 --> 17:19.618
but you're not responsible.

17:19.625 --> 17:21.616
Come on, Mac.
We all have our ghosts.

17:21.625 --> 17:23.616
Yeah, but we don't all see 'em
walking by.

17:25.125 --> 17:27.116
She's dead.
It's over.

17:27.625 --> 17:31.117
Hey, listen,
get a good night's sleep.

17:31.125 --> 17:32.114
I love you, man.

17:32.125 --> 17:33.615
I'm glad
to see you.

17:37.625 --> 17:39.616
Thanks.

17:41.125 --> 17:43.616
And I'll see you at the party
tomorrow, young man.

18:15.667 --> 18:18.158
What are you so
tickled about?

18:18.667 --> 18:19.656
You.

18:19.667 --> 18:22.158
You're funny.

18:22.166 --> 18:24.157
Me? What are
you talking
about funny, no?

18:25.709 --> 18:28.155
You are just funny, that's all.

18:29.709 --> 18:31.165
And I love you, MacGyver.

18:37.166 --> 18:39.157
I love you, too.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.699
Even if you aren't
much to look at.

18:48.709 --> 18:51.701
Oh, face, body, ey
es, ears, nose, throat

18:52.208 --> 18:54.699
that's all
medium-gorgeous,
of course.

18:54.709 --> 18:56.700
But your hand.

18:56.709 --> 18:59.200
It's downright naked.

18:59.709 --> 19:00.698
Let me look at it.

19:00.709 --> 19:02.199
It's like
the rest of you.

19:02.208 --> 19:05.746
No necklace,
no earrings.

19:07.208 --> 19:09.199
Nothing.

19:09.750 --> 19:11.206
You need something.

19:13.750 --> 19:15.741
I have what I need.

19:17.208 --> 19:19.199
Almost.

19:31.750 --> 19:33.741
MacGyver.

19:58.792 --> 20:03.240
"MacGyver, I will be"
on the 6:45 morning ferry.

20:03.250 --> 20:05.286
Please come to me.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.282
"I won't be late this time."

20:07.291 --> 20:09.782
Lisa.

20:21.291 --> 20:23.282
Lisa.

20:33.291 --> 20:36.283
I was shot, yes.

20:36.291 --> 20:38.282
I was hurt badly.

20:38.291 --> 20:40.282
But I lived.

20:40.291 --> 20:42.828
I am alive, MacGyver.

20:42.834 --> 20:45.826
But you never let me know.

20:45.834 --> 20:48.826
Why? What happened?

20:48.834 --> 20:50.324
They sent
me to the gulag.

20:50.333 --> 20:52.324
To a prison camp.

20:52.834 --> 20:55.325
There was only one reason
I survived.

20:55.834 --> 20:56.823
Nicolai.

20:56.834 --> 20:58.324
Another prisoner?

20:58.333 --> 20:59.823
In a sense.

21:00.333 --> 21:02.324
He had been with the KGB.

21:02.834 --> 21:05.871
There was an incident,
a failure, and he was punished.

21:05.875 --> 21:09.322
Sent to the camp,
a prisoner... like me.

21:09.333 --> 21:11.324
Then he helped you?

21:11.333 --> 21:14.325
He kept me alive.

21:14.333 --> 21:15.869
He protected me.

21:16.333 --> 21:18.324
Cared for me.

21:20.333 --> 21:22.324
MacGyver...

21:24.875 --> 21:26.866
I married him.

21:28.875 --> 21:31.366
Please understand how it was.

21:31.375 --> 21:33.366
Never a love affair.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.866
Not the way it was with us.

21:35.875 --> 21:38.867
But Nicolai
is my husband.

21:43.375 --> 21:45.366
That's why you never got
in touch with me.

21:46.917 --> 21:49.374
Yes.

21:49.375 --> 21:51.366
And the reason
I've come to you now is...

21:52.917 --> 21:55.374
a very selfish reason.

21:55.375 --> 21:57.912
But I have to tell you

21:57.917 --> 21:59.908
all the truth.

22:02.375 --> 22:04.912
My husband's name

22:04.917 --> 22:08.409
is Nicolai Kosoff.

22:09.917 --> 22:11.407
Kosoff.

22:12.917 --> 22:15.408
Major Nicolai Kosoff?

22:17.417 --> 22:18.406
I know him.

22:18.417 --> 22:20.908
I escaped from him in Hungary.

22:20.917 --> 22:23.909
Yes, I know.

22:25.959 --> 22:28.416
And if you don't want
to help us now,

22:28.417 --> 22:30.408
I understand.

22:32.959 --> 22:36.952
MacGyver, we want to defect.

22:38.959 --> 22:40.950
That's quite a story.

22:40.959 --> 22:42.415
Do you believe her?

22:43.959 --> 22:45.449
She wants to defect.

22:45.458 --> 22:46.948
She wants to
bring her husband.

22:47.458 --> 22:48.447
And I want to help

22:48.959 --> 22:49.948
Yeah, I believe her.

22:50.458 --> 22:52.449
Lisa, maybe.

22:52.458 --> 22:53.948
Nicolai Kosoff?

22:53.959 --> 22:55.950
Ex-KGB?

22:55.959 --> 22:56.948
Pete Thornton?

22:56.959 --> 22:58.950
Ex-DXS?

22:59.959 --> 23:02.951
People change.

23:02.959 --> 23:04.449
Kosoff is here

23:04.458 --> 23:06.995
with the Soviet delegation
to the Exposition.

23:07.001 --> 23:08.457
He's not KGB.

23:08.458 --> 23:10.995
And maybe not the guy
I tangled with in Budapest.

23:11.001 --> 23:13.447
You love her,

23:13.458 --> 23:15.449
so you're buying him,
is that it?

23:16.001 --> 23:16.990
I'm giving him a chance,
because

23:17.001 --> 23:19.447
if he's playing it straight
with us, he deserves it.

23:19.458 --> 23:20.447
lf?!

23:21.001 --> 23:22.992
That's a life-and-death if.

23:28.500 --> 23:30.491
You gonna help?

23:30.500 --> 23:32.491
All right, we'll go
with your instincts.

23:33.001 --> 23:35.993
I'll slip away in a few minutes
and make some arrangements.

23:36.001 --> 23:37.491
But here comes
the Russian delegation.

23:37.500 --> 23:38.489
Be charming.

23:43.001 --> 23:43.990
Ah!

23:44.500 --> 23:45.489
General Racoubian!

23:45.500 --> 23:46.990
Mr. Thornton.

23:47.000 --> 23:47.989
Welcome. I'd like

23:48.000 --> 23:49.991
to introduce my associate,
Mr. MacGyver.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.490
General, it's a pleasure.

23:51.500 --> 23:52.489
Ex-General, retired.

23:52.500 --> 23:54.491
Merely a civilian
delegate

23:54.500 --> 23:55.489
to this exposition.

23:55.500 --> 23:56.990
My colleagues.

23:57.000 --> 23:57.989
Major Kosoff.

23:58.500 --> 24:00.991
Mrs. Kosoff.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.991
We met once.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.537
Yes.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.991
And, uh, Miss Lyaschenka

24:09.000 --> 24:10.536
Jack Dalton.

24:10.542 --> 24:12.999
Nice to meet you.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.991
Outstanding!

24:17.542 --> 24:19.533
General
Racoubian,

24:19.542 --> 24:21.533
I hope you enjoy
our Ming Dragon.

24:21.542 --> 24:23.999
Extraordinary!

24:24.542 --> 24:26.032
Priceless.

24:26.041 --> 24:28.532
The second most beautiful thing
in the room.

24:30.041 --> 24:31.531
Your humble servant,
Mademoiselle.

24:31.542 --> 24:33.533
The Great Sheldrake
at your service.

24:35.041 --> 24:38.033
Uh, Jack, I don't think
this is the time.

24:38.041 --> 24:39.531
Time? The Great Sheldrake
performs

24:40.041 --> 24:41.030
at 3:00 this afternoon.

24:41.041 --> 24:42.531
You are all invited.

24:42.542 --> 24:44.032
Oh, a magician.

24:44.041 --> 24:46.032
What, with
the exposition?

24:46.041 --> 24:47.577
Unofficially.

24:47.583 --> 24:48.572
That's all you need

24:48.583 --> 24:50.039
for international
friendship, friends.

24:50.041 --> 24:51.030
Magic.

24:51.041 --> 24:52.577
Got to change.

24:52.583 --> 24:54.574
May I show you the rest
of the exhibit?

24:55.041 --> 24:57.032
Please?

25:29.083 --> 25:31.074
Lisa tells me
you will help us.

25:31.083 --> 25:33.074
And, of course
, I know why.

25:33.625 --> 25:35.081
You still love her.

25:37.625 --> 25:39.081
Understandable.

25:39.083 --> 25:40.619
So do I.

25:40.625 --> 25:43.617
I can understand that.

25:43.625 --> 25:45.115
If you will not help me,

25:45.125 --> 25:47.116
I understand.

25:47.125 --> 25:51.118
But please... help Lisa.

25:51.125 --> 25:53.116
Why do you want out?

25:53.125 --> 25:57.118
I was two years
in a prison camp.

25:57.125 --> 26:00.117
I learned one thing, MacGyver...

26:00.125 --> 26:02.116
to cherish freedom...

26:02.125 --> 26:04.116
for myself...

26:04.125 --> 26:05.661
for my Lisa.

26:06.125 --> 26:08.116
How'd you get her
out of the camp?

26:09.667 --> 26:11.123
I destroyed her records,

26:11.125 --> 26:13.116
forged new ones.

26:13.125 --> 26:15.116
I hid her past.

26:15.125 --> 26:17.662
And we were lucky.

26:17.667 --> 26:20.124
My God, we were lucky.

26:20.125 --> 26:21.114
This new government,

26:21.125 --> 26:23.662
glasnost, openness.

26:24.125 --> 26:26.161
And for this little moment,

26:26.166 --> 26:28.657
the ice melts,
and we get out.

26:29.166 --> 26:30.656
But if they ever discover

26:30.667 --> 26:32.157
who she really was...

26:33.166 --> 26:36.158
...Lisa goes back,

26:36.166 --> 26:38.157
and I would be shot.

26:42.166 --> 26:43.656
I don't...

26:43.667 --> 26:47.159
enjoy begging, MacGyver,

26:47.166 --> 26:51.705
but for Lisa, I will.

26:53.709 --> 26:54.698
You think you could

26:54.709 --> 26:56.165
talk your little group
into going to see

26:56.709 --> 26:58.165
The Great Sheldrake's
magic show?

26:58.709 --> 27:00.700
I suppose so.

27:00.709 --> 27:01.698
But why?

27:02.166 --> 27:04.157
I can't think of a better place

27:04.166 --> 27:08.205
to pull off a disappearing act.

27:08.208 --> 27:09.698
Welcome to the universe

27:09.709 --> 27:10.698
of infinite improbability!

27:11.208 --> 27:13.699
Ladies and gentlemen,

27:14.208 --> 27:16.699
The Great Sheldrake!

27:21.208 --> 27:25.201
Greetings from beyond
the mystic veil,

27:25.208 --> 27:27.745
where nothing is what it seems.

27:34.750 --> 27:36.206
You know, friends,

27:36.208 --> 27:37.744
I come from a long line
of magicians.

27:37.750 --> 27:39.206
My father used to walk

27:39.208 --> 27:40.744
down the street
and turn into a saloon.

27:40.750 --> 27:41.739
Thank you.

27:41.750 --> 27:43.206
Tonight I shall be guiding you

27:43.208 --> 27:45.745
through the eerie entryway
to another universe.

27:45.750 --> 27:47.741
For my first feat of wonder,

27:47.750 --> 27:50.241
I shall require a volunteer.

27:50.250 --> 27:52.741
Preferably someone young,

27:52.750 --> 27:54.741
and beautiful.

27:56.250 --> 27:57.239
Ah!

27:57.250 --> 27:59.241
You certainly qualify.

28:00.750 --> 28:03.241
And so do you.

28:03.250 --> 28:05.241
Will you both yield yourselves

28:05.250 --> 28:07.787
to the magical powers
of the Great Sheldrake?!

28:10.792 --> 28:12.248
I don't know.

28:12.250 --> 28:13.239
Go ahead, Lisa.

28:13.792 --> 28:15.783
Both of you, go ahead.

28:16.250 --> 28:17.239
Wonderful, wonderful.

28:17.250 --> 28:18.239
Here they come.

28:18.250 --> 28:19.786
Now, ladies,
as you join me on the stage,

28:19.792 --> 28:21.248
I want you
to examine this common,

28:21.250 --> 28:22.786
ordinary box.

28:22.792 --> 28:23.781
Search it.

28:23.792 --> 28:24.781
Inspect it.

28:25.291 --> 28:26.280
Examine it.

28:26.291 --> 28:29.283
Be sure that it's empty.

28:29.291 --> 28:30.781
An empty box.

28:30.792 --> 28:33.283
But also, the gateway

28:33.792 --> 28:35.783
to another dimension.

28:35.792 --> 28:37.783
To the world of illusion.

28:37.792 --> 28:39.783
Prepare yourself
for a wondrous experience.

28:39.792 --> 28:41.282
Don't be frightened,

28:41.291 --> 28:42.781
you're perfectly safe.

28:43.792 --> 28:45.828
And now friends, beyond gravity,

28:46.291 --> 28:47.280
beyond reality,

28:47.834 --> 28:50.280
beyond belief.

28:50.291 --> 28:52.828
Rise!

28:54.291 --> 28:56.282
Rise!

28:59.291 --> 29:02.829
Take this instrument
of the unknown

29:02.834 --> 29:05.325
and become the keeper
of the gate.

29:05.333 --> 29:07.324
Hold the wand

29:07.333 --> 29:08.823
for all to see,

29:08.834 --> 29:11.325
and with the power
I give unto you,

29:11.333 --> 29:12.322
open the portals,

29:12.834 --> 29:14.324
guide her beautiful soul

29:14.834 --> 29:17.826
to the freedom
of another dimension!

29:22.333 --> 29:23.322
Fantastic!

29:23.333 --> 29:24.869
Thank you.

29:24.875 --> 29:26.331
Thank you, thank you.

29:26.875 --> 29:28.866
Where is she?
She's okay.

29:28.875 --> 29:30.866
Where is she?

29:30.875 --> 29:33.332
Out of the way, fool!

29:33.333 --> 29:34.322
Hey, blondie,

29:34.333 --> 29:35.322
your table's out front.

29:35.875 --> 29:36.864
I'll go find Lisa

29:36.875 --> 29:39.332
before Tanya
creates an incident.

29:39.333 --> 29:41.324
...but don't be alarmed,
my friends, be patient.

29:41.333 --> 29:43.324
The beautiful young lady
who vanished

29:43.333 --> 29:45.870
shall return when the
configurations are aligned,

29:45.875 --> 29:47.365
when the planets move once again

29:47.375 --> 29:48.865
in their appointed paths.

29:48.875 --> 29:51.366
Lead her back sagely now,
oh, gods of the unknown.

29:51.375 --> 29:52.865
Protect her on her journey...

29:59.375 --> 30:00.364
And while we're waiting

30:00.375 --> 30:02.866
for her to return,
ladies and gentlemen,

30:02.875 --> 30:05.912
for my next feat of magic,
I need another volunteer.

30:05.917 --> 30:08.374
A small volunteer.

30:17.375 --> 30:18.911
MacGyver! Lisa!

30:24.375 --> 30:25.911
Nicolai!

30:25.917 --> 30:26.906
Get Lisa free!

30:30.917 --> 30:32.407
Get her away!

30:34.917 --> 30:35.406
Come on, let's go.

30:37.417 --> 30:38.907
Come on!
No!

30:38.917 --> 30:39.906
No!

30:53.125 --> 30:55.116
Put him in there!

30:55.125 --> 30:58.117
Get out the van!

30:58.125 --> 30:59.615
To the helicopter pad.

30:59.625 --> 31:00.614
Quickly!

31:28.166 --> 31:30.157
Hang on!
MacGyver!

31:33.166 --> 31:34.656
There they are.

31:38.166 --> 31:39.656
Go down the next street.

31:40.667 --> 31:43.659
Look out!

31:45.166 --> 31:47.157
No!

31:55.166 --> 31:56.155
Where are we going?

31:56.166 --> 31:57.702
We'll try to lose
them on the docks.

31:58.166 --> 31:59.702
Turn right, turn right!

32:45.250 --> 32:46.740
What are we doing?

32:46.750 --> 32:48.741
Just hang on tight.

33:22.250 --> 33:24.787
I can't believe it.

33:25.291 --> 33:27.782
We lost them! No.

33:27.792 --> 33:29.783
We have them.

33:32.291 --> 33:33.781
Give me the phone.

33:38.792 --> 33:41.283
General, we will be needing

33:41.291 --> 33:43.782
just the smallest assistance.

33:44.291 --> 33:47.283
They are trapped on the ferry,
heading for North Island.

33:47.291 --> 33:48.827
If you will come
in the helicopter,

33:49.291 --> 33:52.283
we will drive over the bridge.

33:57.834 --> 34:00.280
Here you go.

34:00.291 --> 34:01.827
Thank you.

34:01.834 --> 34:03.290
You okay?

34:07.834 --> 34:10.324
Lisa, we're okay.

34:10.333 --> 34:12.824
You're safe,
we made it.

34:12.833 --> 34:13.822
But not Nicolai.

34:14.333 --> 34:16.324
First, I lose you, and now...

34:16.333 --> 34:18.324
Hey, wait a
minute, stop it.

34:18.333 --> 34:19.322
Stop right there.

34:19.833 --> 34:21.324
You haven't lost
anything yet.

34:21.833 --> 34:22.822
As soon as we get to shore,

34:22.833 --> 34:23.822
I'll contact Pete.

34:24.333 --> 34:25.322
He's lined up all the help

34:25.875 --> 34:26.864
we could possibly need.

34:29.333 --> 34:31.324
We'll get Nicolai out.

34:31.333 --> 34:33.324
I don't think they're ready

34:33.333 --> 34:34.869
to start World War III

34:34.875 --> 34:35.864
within city limits.

34:41.875 --> 34:44.331
That's General Racoubian's
helicopter.

34:47.875 --> 34:49.866
I think we're lost.

34:50.875 --> 34:52.364
Hey, Pete!

34:55.375 --> 34:57.366
Thank you very much.

34:57.875 --> 34:59.365
So what happened?
Where are they?

34:59.375 --> 35:00.364
Nothing happened.

35:00.875 --> 35:01.864
It went smooth as silk.

35:01.875 --> 35:03.365
That big, beautiful.

35:03.375 --> 35:04.364
Russian fire alarm
jumped my bones

35:04.375 --> 35:05.364
and they split
out the back door.

35:05.917 --> 35:07.908
Well, they never showed
at home base.

35:07.917 --> 35:09.373
What do you mean
, they never showed?

35:09.375 --> 35:11.366
Mac had it locked,
everything was on course.

35:11.375 --> 35:12.911
A doyen witnesses just told me

35:12.917 --> 35:15.374
they rolled out of here
at 80 miles an hour

35:15.375 --> 35:16.911
on a stolen motorcycle.

35:16.917 --> 35:18.373
You sure about that?

35:18.375 --> 35:20.366
Well, I just paid
for the motorcycle.

35:20.375 --> 35:21.911
Well, then,
where are they?

35:26.417 --> 35:27.907
Tanya, the ferry has docked,

35:27.917 --> 35:29.407
but they're still aboard.

35:29.417 --> 35:30.907
Message received, sir.

35:30.917 --> 35:32.407
I'm tracking them now.

35:32.417 --> 35:33.406
Where are you?

35:33.417 --> 35:34.907
Crossing the bridge, General.

35:34.917 --> 35:37.408
We will be on North Island
within minutes.

35:37.417 --> 35:39.908
We are only a few miles away.

35:39.917 --> 35:40.906
Good, the plan is

35:40.917 --> 35:42.407
to keep them between us.

35:42.417 --> 35:43.907
When they move,
I'll drive them toward you.

35:47.417 --> 35:48.406
What do you think?

35:48.417 --> 35:52.410
I don't think
we should stick around.

35:56.417 --> 35:57.953
They're moving now.

35:57.959 --> 35:59.950
Just leaving the ferry,
stand by.

35:59.959 --> 36:01.415
Understood.

36:02.959 --> 36:04.950
They're heading
in your direction,

36:04.959 --> 36:06.950
on the coast road.

36:06.959 --> 36:08.950
Go west along the waterfront.

36:08.959 --> 36:10.449
You'll head them off.

36:10.458 --> 36:11.948
It'll all be over
in a few minutes.

36:11.959 --> 36:13.449
Turning on the coast road now.

36:50.500 --> 36:52.491
Tanya, we're directly

36:53.001 --> 36:53.990
over them now,

36:54.001 --> 36:55.491
and you should be
seeing us soon.

36:55.500 --> 36:56.990
There's nobody in sight.

36:57.001 --> 36:59.993
We can begin to isolate them.

37:00.500 --> 37:01.489
I read you, General.

37:01.500 --> 37:02.990
Good.

37:03.500 --> 37:05.491
Don't shoot!

37:06.500 --> 37:07.489
Get them off the road.

37:07.500 --> 37:08.990
I don't want any interference.

37:12.000 --> 37:12.989
General, I have you in sight.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.491
Why are we slowing down?

37:28.000 --> 37:30.537
We're running out of gas.

37:36.542 --> 37:37.998
They're turning off
into the woods!

37:38.000 --> 37:39.536
Stay with them.

37:39.542 --> 37:40.531
Don't lose them.

37:40.542 --> 37:41.998
I can see you both.

37:42.000 --> 37:42.989
I'm right above you.

37:43.542 --> 37:46.534
Tanya, I'm turning them

37:46.542 --> 37:48.032
back toward you.

37:48.041 --> 37:51.533
We have them now.

37:51.542 --> 37:53.533
That's it. Keep calm.

37:53.542 --> 37:56.033
Wait, wait!
They're going to the river!

38:30.083 --> 38:31.573
End of the line.

38:31.583 --> 38:32.572
She's empty.

38:34.583 --> 38:35.572
Come on...

38:36.083 --> 38:37.573
Come on, let's go.

38:44.083 --> 38:46.074
They're heading for the boat.

38:46.083 --> 38:48.074
We see them, General.

39:02.083 --> 39:04.074
Wait!

39:04.083 --> 39:06.119
Get down!

39:07.625 --> 39:10.116
We are trapped!

39:27.667 --> 39:29.658
We are trapped!

39:31.125 --> 39:31.659
Not yet.

39:34.125 --> 39:35.661
Come on!

40:48.750 --> 40:51.207
Get on!

41:26.250 --> 41:30.243
Where are they?

41:30.250 --> 41:32.241
Have to be this way.

41:37.792 --> 41:39.783
Get ready.

41:47.291 --> 41:49.782
Come on. Jump.

42:07.291 --> 42:08.280
Come on,
we'll grab the van.

42:47.333 --> 42:49.324
Well, we've certainly

42:49.875 --> 42:51.331
done the town, haven't we?

42:51.333 --> 42:52.322
Yep.

42:52.875 --> 42:53.864
And probably attracted

42:53.875 --> 42:56.332
a little attention
along the way, General.

42:56.333 --> 42:58.324
Now, I could be wrong,
but I'd be willing to bet

42:58.333 --> 43:00.870
that your government
doesn't want an incident here.

43:00.875 --> 43:02.331
And there won't be one.

43:02.333 --> 43:04.870
I may be a little irritated
with you, MacGyver,

43:04.875 --> 43:05.864
but admiring.

43:06.375 --> 43:07.364
As for you

43:07.375 --> 43:08.865
and Major Kosoff

43:08.875 --> 43:12.367
you took a chance;
you'll pay the price.

43:12.375 --> 43:14.366
He's going to kill us.

43:14.375 --> 43:17.367
I'm sorry
I brought you into this.

43:19.375 --> 43:20.364
Come on, General,

43:20.875 --> 43:22.365
let's see if
we can deal.

43:22.375 --> 43:24.866
Call in a little
glasnost, you and me.

43:24.875 --> 43:30.370
I like you, MacGyver,
but I can't let them go.

43:30.375 --> 43:32.366
As for glasnost, I don't agree

43:32.375 --> 43:35.367
with the current
Soviet administration...

43:35.375 --> 43:36.911
this new openness.

43:36.917 --> 43:40.910
Weak, foolish... impractical.

43:40.917 --> 43:43.909
And you think killing
three people's more practical?

43:43.917 --> 43:45.908
That's amaying.

43:46.417 --> 43:47.907
Okay, General,
what's it gonna take?

43:47.917 --> 43:48.906
What's the price?

43:48.917 --> 43:50.407
You know what trade I deal in.

43:50.417 --> 43:51.907
What could you possibly
offer me?

43:51.917 --> 43:53.407
I know you won't betray

43:53.417 --> 43:54.907
your country's security.

43:54.917 --> 43:55.906
You got that straight.

43:56.417 --> 44:00.410
Maybe there is something.

44:04.417 --> 44:07.955
So there is no
misunderstanding...

44:11.959 --> 44:12.414
Jewelry?

44:13.959 --> 44:15.950
It's not jewelry.

44:15.959 --> 44:20.407
But it's a work of art,
and beauty.

44:25.417 --> 44:28.454
This device is armed.

44:28.458 --> 44:29.948
When I push this button,

44:29.959 --> 44:33.451
any unauthoriyed attempt
to open the necklace,

44:33.458 --> 44:35.949
once it's shut,
will cause it to trigger.

44:35.959 --> 44:37.950
Armed for what?

44:38.458 --> 44:40.949
Good question.

44:40.959 --> 44:47.000
This second button
transmits a signal

44:47.001 --> 44:49.993
good for at least five miles.

44:59.001 --> 45:00.992
You are a hostage.

45:01.001 --> 45:02.992
So is Nicolai.

45:03.001 --> 45:06.994
What price for freedom,
you ask?

45:08.500 --> 45:10.491
The Ming Dragon.

45:10.500 --> 45:12.491
Deliver it to me.

45:12.500 --> 45:15.492
You want me
to steal it?

45:15.500 --> 45:16.489
Yes.

45:16.500 --> 45:17.990
That's impossible.

45:18.001 --> 45:18.990
Nothing's impossible.

45:19.001 --> 45:21.492
Consider the alternative.

45:21.500 --> 45:24.492
She has until 2:00 tomorrow.

45:24.500 --> 45:26.991
If you attempt to rescue her
or if she tries to escape...

45:27.500 --> 45:28.489
if you try to do anything

45:28.500 --> 45:29.990
but get me
the Dragon...

45:34.000 --> 45:35.490
You got a deal.

45:35.500 --> 45:37.991
Good. Bring her.

45:45.500 --> 45:48.537
Go fetch, MacGyver.
