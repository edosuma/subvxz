00:15.449 --> 00:17.894
Ay, Dios mio.

00:17.918 --> 00:21.217
Mr. Parsons, this time
it's going to cost you extra.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.520
Hello?

00:34.401 --> 00:36.392
Mr. Parsons?

00:37.438 --> 00:39.749
¡Maldiga gato!

00:39.773 --> 00:41.108
What are you doing in there?

00:49.049 --> 00:51.040
Mr. Parsons.

01:31.258 --> 01:33.370
Agent McGee.

01:33.394 --> 01:35.538
Hello, Director.

01:35.562 --> 01:37.140
Agents DiNozzo and David.

01:37.164 --> 01:38.408
They were supposed to contact me

01:38.432 --> 01:39.843
before they left
with our witness.

01:39.867 --> 01:41.511
I should have gotten a call
by now.

01:41.535 --> 01:43.480
Yeah, their flight was delayed.

01:43.504 --> 01:46.349
Are you sure about that?

01:46.373 --> 01:48.318
Paris can be very hard to leave.

01:48.342 --> 01:49.686
Not for them, no.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.788
Tony and Ziva don't like
traveling together much.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.890
Actually, they don't
like doing much

01:53.914 --> 01:54.891
of anything together.

01:54.915 --> 01:56.326
I think it's safe to say

01:56.350 --> 01:58.495
that they're not enjoying
themselves very much right now.

01:58.519 --> 02:01.579
SECNAV wants that witness here
by tomorrow morning.

02:02.823 --> 02:04.814
Where the hell are they?

02:12.433 --> 02:13.910
Bonjour, McGee.

02:13.934 --> 02:15.578
Oh, everything's fine.

02:15.602 --> 02:17.247
We are leaving for the airport

02:17.271 --> 02:19.282
as soon as Tony returns
from seeing the sights.

02:19.306 --> 02:21.685
- Here.
- Finally.

02:21.709 --> 02:23.353
Okay, McGee. Um, au revoir.

02:23.377 --> 02:24.921
Tell McGee I love Paree.

02:24.945 --> 02:27.424
Why don't you tell him yourself
when you get back?

02:27.448 --> 02:29.326
We must pick up our witness
at the embassy.

02:29.350 --> 02:30.593
- Come on.
- Whoa, whoa.

02:30.617 --> 02:31.695
Hold your horses.

02:31.719 --> 02:33.730
You know, one day

02:33.754 --> 02:36.382
just isn't enough
in this town, is it?

02:37.891 --> 02:39.202
I get why artists love it.

02:39.226 --> 02:41.471
Something about the light.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.506
Picasso, Rodin.

02:43.530 --> 02:44.874
Cancan girls
at the Moulin Rouge.

02:44.898 --> 02:47.401
This is not a vacation, Tony.

02:48.902 --> 02:51.247
But it is a beautiful day.

02:51.271 --> 02:54.684
Why are you
in such a pleasant mood?

02:54.708 --> 02:56.686
What's wrong with you?

02:56.710 --> 02:58.521
I slept well last night.

02:58.545 --> 03:00.290
Why, didn't you?

03:00.314 --> 03:01.991
You certainly looked...

03:02.015 --> 03:03.812
comfy enough.

03:09.289 --> 03:11.201
Paris. France.

03:11.225 --> 03:13.470
I mean, it's really not
what I thought it would be.

03:13.494 --> 03:15.171
You know?

03:15.195 --> 03:18.007
Of course, all I had to go on
was a French arms dealer

03:18.031 --> 03:20.009
and his rather fetching
daughter.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.945
C'est la vie.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.279
That's French for something.

03:23.303 --> 03:25.281
"That's life."

03:25.305 --> 03:26.329
Let's go.

03:30.144 --> 03:31.521
Vite, vite.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.656
- Après vous.
- Ha.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.592
Here we go. Hop on.

03:35.616 --> 03:37.551
I'm getting pretty good at this.

03:47.161 --> 03:50.840
Flight is scheduled
to depart Paris at 16:30.

03:50.864 --> 03:51.975
- Keep me posted.
- Grab your stuff, McGee.

03:51.999 --> 03:54.010
We're going on a trip
of our own.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.979
Some place exotic?

03:56.003 --> 03:57.180
Oh, yeah.

03:57.204 --> 03:58.314
Downtown.

03:58.338 --> 04:00.683
- Just the two of us, boss?
- Nope.

04:00.707 --> 04:02.685
You, me, Ducky,

04:02.709 --> 04:05.542
and a dead Marine.

04:07.548 --> 04:09.125
Sergeant Mark Parsons.

04:09.149 --> 04:10.794
Marine... Special.

04:10.818 --> 04:12.629
- Ops Command.
- I feel it

04:12.653 --> 04:16.132
only appropriate,
that in Agent DiNozzo's absence,

04:16.156 --> 04:19.235
I make an observation
about this unique crime scene.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.171
Go for it, Duck.

04:21.195 --> 04:23.506
A terrified Janet Leigh.

04:23.530 --> 04:26.294
And the inability to enter
the shower for several weeks.

04:27.901 --> 04:29.979
It's a reference
to the film Psycho.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.381
There, feel better now?

04:31.405 --> 04:32.682
Yeah.

04:32.706 --> 04:36.252
Yes, apart from these
feline scratches,

04:36.276 --> 04:38.254
I see no obvious signs
of trauma.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.823
Got a time of death?

04:39.847 --> 04:42.725
Rigor has resolved itself.

04:42.749 --> 04:45.161
Postmortem lividity is fixed,

04:45.185 --> 04:46.930
and I see several fly ova

04:46.954 --> 04:50.567
in his nostrils and ears.

04:50.591 --> 04:53.169
Ergo, this man succumbed

04:53.193 --> 04:55.939
between 36 and 48 hours ago.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.874
- Killer got a head start.
- Yeah.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.409
No doubt that was the intention.

04:59.433 --> 05:03.379
The sodium silicate
in crystal-based kitty litter

05:03.403 --> 05:05.281
is a very effective
odor absorber,

05:05.305 --> 05:07.917
thereby preventing the smell

05:07.941 --> 05:10.186
from alerting the neighbors.

05:10.210 --> 05:13.189
Apart from the housekeeper,
he might have lain there

05:13.213 --> 05:14.924
undiscovered for days.

05:14.948 --> 05:17.393
Time to change the box.

05:17.417 --> 05:18.528
Boss,

05:18.552 --> 05:19.529
I finished processing

05:19.553 --> 05:21.531
the, uh, rest of the condo.

05:21.555 --> 05:22.899
No signs of a struggle.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.601
And there were quite a few
high-dollar items

05:24.625 --> 05:25.802
left out in plain sight.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.437
Not a robbery.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.105
Which begs another mystery.

05:29.129 --> 05:32.108
Yeah, how does an E-5 Marine
making three grand a month

05:32.132 --> 05:33.710
manage to live like this?

05:33.734 --> 05:35.258
Precisely.

05:36.503 --> 05:39.382
You know, I did find
a safe bolted

05:39.406 --> 05:41.384
- inside a living room cabinet.
- Let's go.

05:41.408 --> 05:43.205
Let's open it.

05:46.246 --> 05:47.848
Seat 9-A.

05:49.116 --> 05:51.127
Finally, I get to catch up
on my reading.

05:51.151 --> 05:54.364
Nora, for a whistle-blower
on a major defense fraud scam,

05:54.388 --> 05:55.398
you seem awfully relaxed.

05:55.422 --> 05:57.667
I have faith in you
to protect me.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.402
Well, most
of our material witnesses

05:59.426 --> 06:01.671
are frightened parasites.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.473
I wish all the people
we dealt with

06:03.497 --> 06:05.108
were as nice as you.

06:05.132 --> 06:07.225
- I'm nice.
- Ha!

06:08.335 --> 06:10.213
I just came across
a wrong in the world

06:10.237 --> 06:12.148
that I could help make right.

06:12.172 --> 06:14.050
Oh. Wow.

06:14.074 --> 06:15.769
We're protecting Hayley Mills.

06:17.344 --> 06:18.888
You know, Pollyanna.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.823
Disney classic
with a happy ending.

06:20.847 --> 06:22.191
Hmm, I like those.

06:22.215 --> 06:25.461
Tony prefers Bambi,
where the mother dies.

06:25.485 --> 06:28.010
And I'm not the nice one?

06:30.791 --> 06:32.190
That must be him.

06:33.293 --> 06:36.023
Excuse me?

06:38.398 --> 06:39.576
NCIS.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.610
Been looking for you.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.478
I'm Agent David.

06:42.502 --> 06:44.480
That is Agent DiNozzo.

06:44.504 --> 06:46.516
And she is our witness.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.518
Federal Air Marshal Art Neeley.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.853
I already got a head count

06:50.877 --> 06:52.121
and I cross-checked
the passenger list

06:52.145 --> 06:54.324
with federal offender databases.

06:54.348 --> 06:56.392
All clear for takeoff.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.661
We've
been cleared to leave the gate.

06:58.685 --> 07:00.296
We'll be getting under way
just as soon

07:00.320 --> 07:02.098
as everyone's in their seat,
with their seat belt fastened.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.533
Thank you.

07:03.557 --> 07:05.001
Excuse me. If you wouldn't
mind taking your seat,

07:05.025 --> 07:06.302
we're ready to pull
away from the gate.

07:06.326 --> 07:08.304
I'm also ready for my hot towel.

07:08.328 --> 07:09.339
First class only, sir.

07:09.363 --> 07:11.354
Sorry.

07:12.699 --> 07:14.711
And they say the stimulus
is working.

07:14.735 --> 07:16.212
Real friendly.

07:16.236 --> 07:17.447
Up here in first class.

07:17.471 --> 07:19.462
Oh, sorry, business.
Business class.

07:30.517 --> 07:32.508
All right, I think we're ready.

07:34.755 --> 07:37.057
What do we got?

07:39.760 --> 07:41.437
Watches. Beautiful ones.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.439
These look very expensive, boss.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.208
The folders, McGee.

07:45.232 --> 07:47.223
Ah, yes.

07:50.904 --> 07:53.549
Newspaper clippings.

07:53.573 --> 07:56.419
All pertaining to a murder
investigation in New York City.

07:56.443 --> 08:00.890
The death of real estate mogul
Sam Thoresen six months ago.

08:00.914 --> 08:03.226
Home invasion,
nothing was stolen.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.561
NYPD suspected
a professional hit.

08:05.585 --> 08:07.563
Case is still unsolved.

08:07.587 --> 08:10.433
He was tracking
the investigation.

08:10.457 --> 08:12.969
Why? And why keep it
locked in the safe?

08:12.993 --> 08:15.471
Making sure he got away clean.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.040
NYPD was right.

08:17.064 --> 08:18.241
What, you thinking

08:18.265 --> 08:19.942
our dead Marine was moonlighting
as a hit man?

08:19.966 --> 08:22.059
Well, he had a new assignment.

08:24.971 --> 08:27.283
Passport information.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.285
Employment records.
Bank statements.

08:29.309 --> 08:31.621
Unused round-trip

08:31.645 --> 08:33.456
ticket to Paris.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.491
Same flight Tony
and Ziva are on.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.493
This isn't a scrapbook,
it's a dossier.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.062
On his new target.

08:39.086 --> 08:41.631
Nora Williams.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.131
Our whistle-blower.

08:43.155 --> 08:45.386
Our dead guy was going
to kill her.

08:54.634 --> 08:56.446
Sergeant Mark Parsons.

08:56.470 --> 08:58.047
Members of his special ops team

08:58.071 --> 09:00.383
all said that he was a good
Marine but a loner.

09:00.407 --> 09:01.584
No family.

09:01.608 --> 09:02.785
No close friends.

09:02.809 --> 09:04.220
Apparently,
our Marine-turned-hit man

09:04.244 --> 09:05.888
really kept to himself.

09:05.912 --> 09:07.790
The nature of the business.

09:07.814 --> 09:09.058
Parsons was on leave

09:09.082 --> 09:11.094
when the real estate mogul
was shot in New York.

09:11.118 --> 09:13.996
If ballistics match the gun
we found in his safe,

09:14.020 --> 09:15.998
we've solved that case.

09:16.022 --> 09:17.667
Too bad it's not ours.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.068
Well, Abby's processing

09:19.092 --> 09:20.603
his prepaid burn phone.

09:20.627 --> 09:22.638
Could lead us to whoever
hired him to kill our witness.

09:22.662 --> 09:25.508
Or who killed him.

09:25.532 --> 09:27.543
Parsons' dossier
on Nora Williams.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.879
He knew she was living in Paris

09:29.903 --> 09:32.315
and that we were sent to escort
her back to the States.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.250
- Guy did his homework.
- He had all

09:34.274 --> 09:36.319
of Nora's medical records,
phone records,

09:36.343 --> 09:39.188
- info on family, friends.
- Fiancé.

09:39.212 --> 09:40.857
Daniel Sturgis.

09:40.881 --> 09:42.759
He and Nora are supposed
to be married in three months.

09:42.783 --> 09:44.594
Oh, I'm gonna need
to talk to him.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.395
He's already on his way.

09:46.419 --> 09:49.388
It's the Paris case file
on Nora's testimony.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.669
I tried

09:53.693 --> 09:56.405
to talk Nora out of testifying
against Beringer,

09:56.429 --> 09:58.407
but she has this, uh,

09:58.431 --> 10:00.643
infectious outlook
on life that...

10:00.667 --> 10:02.145
Ray Beringer is her boss.

10:02.169 --> 10:05.381
Owner of Beringer Marine,
Incorporated.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.250
I told her... not a guy
you want to cross.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.451
You also work for him.

10:08.475 --> 10:11.287
At our DC headquarters,
here on the Navy Yard.

10:11.311 --> 10:14.724
Uh, Nora and I met
in the accounting department,

10:14.748 --> 10:17.226
before she was transferred
to the Paris branch.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.628
Where she found the evidence

10:18.652 --> 10:20.596
that Beringer was bilking
the Navy.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.746
For millions.

10:23.056 --> 10:25.635
When a Navy fleet makes port
in a foreign country,

10:25.659 --> 10:27.570
any needed repairs

10:27.594 --> 10:30.540
are done
by a local maintenance company.

10:30.564 --> 10:32.542
Beringer Marine is
a major port presence.

10:32.566 --> 10:35.077
At the receiving end
of a lot of contracts.

10:35.101 --> 10:37.747
Navy was paying for repairs
that weren't even requested.

10:37.771 --> 10:39.749
Until Nora found documents

10:39.773 --> 10:42.385
proving that Beringer
was behind the whole thing.

10:42.409 --> 10:45.688
Unfortunately,
those documents disappeared.

10:45.712 --> 10:48.591
The only evidence that we have
is Nora's good memory.

10:48.615 --> 10:50.640
Risking something coming here.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.730
We got nothing on Beringer
without her testimony.

10:54.754 --> 10:57.500
Which is why we'll make sure
that nothing happens to her.

10:57.524 --> 11:00.036
Well, uh, can't you just
arrest him now?

11:00.060 --> 11:01.755
For hiring someone to kill her.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.208
Beringer doesn't know anything
about Nora's testimony

11:05.232 --> 11:06.976
or the case against him.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.144
It's still under wraps

11:08.168 --> 11:09.946
until she meets
with the U.S. attorney.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.514
He must have found out somehow.

11:11.538 --> 11:13.783
That's difficult to prove.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.675
Our best agents are with her.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.288
I hope so.

11:19.312 --> 11:21.974
She just wants
to do what's right.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.263
Just sort of feel
like you can use negative space

11:27.287 --> 11:29.799
to push the image, you know?

11:29.823 --> 11:32.101
Sort of like a geometrical thing

11:32.125 --> 11:34.437
with the light coming across.

11:34.461 --> 11:36.472
I was trying to use
these sort of geometric

11:36.496 --> 11:39.508
lines and spacing.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.110
Sometimes I think maybe

11:41.134 --> 11:44.714
I should have done something
more... creative with my life.

11:44.738 --> 11:48.618
No, I think
you're in the right profession.

11:48.642 --> 11:50.987
All right, Annie Leibovitz.

11:51.011 --> 11:53.155
What's wrong with my pictures?

11:53.179 --> 11:54.891
Okay, McGee, got it. Bye.

11:54.915 --> 11:57.360
Well, they're sort of
soulless, analytical.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.862
They look like...
postcards or...

11:59.886 --> 12:01.046
Crime scene photos.

12:02.088 --> 12:03.633
You just need people in them.

12:03.657 --> 12:04.867
Happy people.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.569
Living people.

12:06.593 --> 12:08.971
Otherwise,
they're just buildings.

12:08.995 --> 12:11.173
Didn't you and Ziva go
sightseeing together?

12:11.197 --> 12:12.808
No.

12:12.832 --> 12:14.610
We had enough "together."

12:14.634 --> 12:17.003
We shared a flight
and a hotel room.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.665
It was the only one available.

12:23.843 --> 12:26.822
That's how me and my fiancé met.

12:26.846 --> 12:29.892
On the job,
traveling on business.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.260
Rule number 12.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.495
What's rule number 12?

12:32.519 --> 12:34.497
Our boss...
he has a list of rules.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.933
Rule number 12 says you should
never date a coworker.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.334
My understanding...
can't be done.

12:38.358 --> 12:39.669
Should not be done.

12:39.693 --> 12:42.104
How do you and your fiancé
make it work?

12:42.128 --> 12:43.272
You two looking for advice?

12:43.296 --> 12:44.607
- No.
- No.

12:44.631 --> 12:45.841
No way.

12:45.865 --> 12:47.510
We do not always get along.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.729
Ever.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.583
So, what was the phone call
all about?

12:54.607 --> 12:56.452
Gibbs and McGee are working
on a case.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.454
Why are they calling us?

12:58.478 --> 13:00.105
In the air?

13:01.881 --> 13:04.260
Does it have to do with me?

13:04.284 --> 13:05.828
Is something wrong?

13:05.852 --> 13:07.363
No.

13:07.387 --> 13:09.065
Not anymore.

13:09.089 --> 13:12.134
Basilica of the Sacred Heart.

13:12.158 --> 13:15.004
That's where Daniel proposed
to me.

13:15.028 --> 13:16.472
I'm gonna miss Paris,

13:16.496 --> 13:18.964
but at least going to DC means
I get to see him.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.578
Gaston Leroux

13:22.602 --> 13:25.448
came up with the idea
for The Phantom of the Opera

13:25.472 --> 13:27.016
when the counterweight

13:27.040 --> 13:29.785
of the great chandelier
came crashing down

13:29.809 --> 13:32.955
and crushed a female patron.

13:32.979 --> 13:35.992
The grand and noble facade
of the Paris Opera House,

13:36.016 --> 13:39.952
hiding a dark
and ignoble secret within.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.399
Uh, not unlike this fellow,
Jethro.

13:43.423 --> 13:47.636
A honorable Marine
masquerading as a hit man.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.405
Other way around, Duck.

13:49.429 --> 13:50.673
You got any more metaphors?

13:50.697 --> 13:52.641
Well, Leroux's book
is full of them.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.945
He explores the dichotomy
between life and death,

13:55.969 --> 13:57.646
truth and falsehood.

13:57.670 --> 13:58.814
Ah, you got one.

13:58.838 --> 13:59.982
Well, like the phantom,

14:00.006 --> 14:03.953
this man's body
also masks a deformation.

14:03.977 --> 14:05.354
You found the cause of death?

14:05.378 --> 14:06.522
Indeed.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.724
A fractured C-1 and 2 vertebrae.

14:08.748 --> 14:10.326
Broke his neck?

14:10.350 --> 14:13.429
There's an absence
of defensive wounds.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.464
Uh, yes.

14:15.488 --> 14:19.335
These fractures were caused
by a single, deliberate move.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.970
Killer was precise?

14:20.994 --> 14:22.671
And practiced.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.541
Whoever killed
our Marine hit man was also

14:25.565 --> 14:27.009
a trained professional.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.344
Thanks, Duck.

14:28.368 --> 14:31.547
Yeah, it's a long time
since I visited Paris.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.835
Or-Or went to the theater,
for that matter.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.686
You asking me on a date, Duck?

14:37.710 --> 14:39.321
Can I come, too?

14:39.345 --> 14:40.389
I'm on my way, Abbs.

14:40.413 --> 14:41.390
I know, I know,

14:41.414 --> 14:42.925
but this couldn't wait.

14:42.949 --> 14:45.528
After processing everything
from our dead guy's condo,

14:45.552 --> 14:46.962
I found extra nothing.

14:46.986 --> 14:48.197
All totally wiped down.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.398
Almost like it was...

14:49.422 --> 14:51.434
- A pro job? Yeah, I know.
- But

14:51.458 --> 14:53.736
I ran the burn phone
from Parsons' safe.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.105
He only received one call
from one number.

14:56.129 --> 14:58.107
I traced it
to a residence in Bethesda.

14:58.131 --> 14:59.909
Give me a name, Abby.

14:59.933 --> 15:02.311
That's what I couldn't wait
to tell you, Gibbs.

15:02.335 --> 15:05.214
The number belongs
to Holly Snow.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.116
The Holly Snow.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.904
Hello?

15:11.778 --> 15:14.314
So you've heard of me,
Agent McGee?

15:16.483 --> 15:18.227
Uh, yes, yes, I have.

15:18.251 --> 15:21.263
By reputation
and a few headlines.

15:21.287 --> 15:23.732
You are DC madam
to the rich and powerful.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.068
Talented, too.
At avoiding arrest.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.582
You flatter me.

15:29.129 --> 15:33.429
When did the love business turn
into the death business?

15:35.235 --> 15:38.247
Excuse me?

15:38.271 --> 15:40.983
Four days ago, you made a call
to Sergeant Mark Parsons.

15:41.007 --> 15:42.451
It was right before
he was murdered.

15:42.475 --> 15:43.652
A hit.

15:43.676 --> 15:44.920
Killed by a pro.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.490
I had nothing
to do with his death.

15:47.514 --> 15:48.824
Yeah, we know that,

15:48.848 --> 15:51.427
but you did hire him
to kill Nora Williams.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.995
Got a search warrant
for your office.

15:53.019 --> 15:55.798
We found an online
pay account linking you

15:55.822 --> 15:58.300
to several known
or suspected hit men.

15:58.324 --> 16:00.569
This time, you were paying
for their services.

16:00.593 --> 16:02.138
To kill.

16:02.162 --> 16:03.606
Once a contractor...

16:03.630 --> 16:05.508
Listen, I'm a matchmaker.

16:05.532 --> 16:08.511
I connect people online.

16:08.535 --> 16:11.413
I never know
what service is being provided.

16:11.437 --> 16:13.449
I never ask.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.251
You really think
a jury's gonna believe that?

16:15.275 --> 16:17.553
All this money for sex.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.255
It's not my money.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.823
I'm not responsible for...

16:20.847 --> 16:23.292
You're an accessory to murder.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.294
You're providing a service.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.163
You're more than responsible.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.781
Who wanted Nora Williams dead?

16:31.491 --> 16:33.482
Look, I don't know names.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.173
But I can

16:37.197 --> 16:41.031
give you the account that
they used to wire me the money.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.965
Half a million dollars.

16:48.641 --> 16:50.768
The numbers.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.246
I don't give it away,
Agent Gibbs.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.478
My services cost.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.200
I'll take a plea deal.

17:04.223 --> 17:05.733
I didn't offer one.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.970
Well, I suggest you do.

17:07.993 --> 17:10.039
And you might want
to be quick about it.

17:10.063 --> 17:11.973
Why is that?

17:11.998 --> 17:14.865
You said Parsons was killed
by another pro.

17:16.569 --> 17:19.915
I can think of 500,000 reasons
why that might be.

17:19.939 --> 17:23.986
These contracts
are not exclusive.

17:24.010 --> 17:26.422
Render the service,

17:26.445 --> 17:29.291
reap the reward.

17:29.315 --> 17:31.427
And, um,

17:31.451 --> 17:33.749
people can be, uh...

17:35.088 --> 17:37.079
competitive.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.436
A hit man killed a hit man.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.805
So, whoever gets the kill

17:42.829 --> 17:45.024
gets the cash.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.685
Okay, understood.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.988
Thank you, Gibbs.

17:59.012 --> 18:00.189
A team
of Homeland Security officers

18:00.213 --> 18:01.791
will be waiting for us
when we land.

18:01.815 --> 18:02.792
Outside the terminal,

18:02.816 --> 18:05.327
an NCIS security detail
will take over.

18:05.351 --> 18:06.796
Not taking any chances,

18:06.820 --> 18:09.498
in case your new hit man tries
something on the ground, huh?

18:09.522 --> 18:11.767
Which is why we must consider
the possibility

18:11.791 --> 18:13.869
that they may try
something on the plane,

18:13.893 --> 18:15.137
where Nora is more vulnerable.

18:15.161 --> 18:16.939
You have reason
to believe they're on board?

18:16.963 --> 18:18.307
Stationary target.

18:18.331 --> 18:19.675
Close quarters.

18:19.699 --> 18:22.211
Modern-day Orient Express.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.814
Hmm. The killer would just need
an inconspicuous weapon.

18:24.838 --> 18:26.649
Like what?

18:26.673 --> 18:29.452
Listen, I've been doing this
for a while, and I doubt

18:29.476 --> 18:30.653
there's anything...

18:30.677 --> 18:32.388
Headphone cables make
for a perfect garrote.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.790
And plastic silverware is
not as safe as you may think.

18:34.814 --> 18:38.051
I once killed a man
using a credit card.

18:40.053 --> 18:41.464
I have been watching a guy.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.132
Row 16.

18:43.156 --> 18:45.134
Couple of rows behind

18:45.158 --> 18:46.502
that girl knitting.

18:46.526 --> 18:47.703
Aisle seat.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.271
He's got his earphones on.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.974
Manifest listed him
as Steven Baker.

18:51.998 --> 18:54.477
He's been ignoring the flight
attendants and refused

18:54.501 --> 18:56.479
anything to eat or drink, but

18:56.503 --> 18:59.215
he's gone to the lavatory
four times already.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.183
It might be nothing, but...

19:01.207 --> 19:02.952
We cannot take any chances.

19:02.976 --> 19:05.187
- Watch him.
- Mm-hmm.

19:05.211 --> 19:07.089
Oh, come on! I just got up.

19:07.113 --> 19:08.524
We are experiencing
a little turbulence,

19:08.548 --> 19:10.228
so please,
everyone return to your seats...

19:12.185 --> 19:14.196
We'll let you know when it's
safe to move about the cabin.

19:14.220 --> 19:15.598
- You all right?
- Yeah.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.399
Oh... look, a Slanket.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.068
- She looks comfortable.
- Yeah.

19:19.092 --> 19:21.528
Something I am not.

19:25.899 --> 19:28.168
How much longer
till we get there?

19:29.335 --> 19:30.495
Hours and hours.

19:32.071 --> 19:33.916
Drink, ma'am?

19:33.940 --> 19:36.418
Oh, no, I don't think so,
Mr. Spock.

19:36.442 --> 19:38.154
Uh, is there a problem, sir?

19:38.178 --> 19:39.221
Eh, no.

19:39.245 --> 19:40.656
Then can I have some water?

19:40.680 --> 19:42.424
That is what this is.

19:42.448 --> 19:44.760
- Bring us some new water.
- Excuse me?

19:44.784 --> 19:46.662
I would like you
to bring us a fresh bottle

19:46.686 --> 19:49.382
of new water,
and open it in front of us.

19:52.425 --> 19:53.858
Sorry.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.438
Got another one
for the watch list.

19:56.462 --> 19:57.673
That one?

19:57.697 --> 19:59.528
Yeah, he's already on it.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.513
Well, merci beaucoup.

20:04.537 --> 20:05.781
Live long and prosper.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.705
Of course.

20:11.411 --> 20:13.923
You think someone's really
trying to kill me, don't you?

20:13.947 --> 20:15.524
Is that a little bit of rain

20:15.548 --> 20:17.116
in your sunny worldview,
Mary Poppins?

20:18.785 --> 20:21.130
Revealing the true nature
of the world isn't going

20:21.154 --> 20:23.890
to change who I am,
Agent DiNozzo.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.202
Maybe it's 'cause I'm in love,

20:26.226 --> 20:28.091
but I don't think
people are bad at heart.

20:31.464 --> 20:33.209
U.S. Attorney's Office is

20:33.233 --> 20:34.810
dragging their feet
on the Holly Snow deal.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.145
Why?

20:36.169 --> 20:37.780
Higher-ups are a little
reluctant about getting into bed

20:37.804 --> 20:39.181
with somebody that keeps
a little black book.

20:39.205 --> 20:40.749
It might be opening up
a can of worms.

20:40.773 --> 20:42.618
- Let's talk about murder here, Leon.
- We'll get it.

20:42.642 --> 20:44.386
She's asking for the world,
and they'll get it.

20:44.410 --> 20:46.021
- It takes time.
- Out of time.

20:46.045 --> 20:47.756
That flight lands, I want
to know who we're looking for.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.058
McGee, go.

20:49.082 --> 20:50.859
Well, assuming
that our new hit man

20:50.883 --> 20:53.162
has the same flight information
our dead hit man had,

20:53.186 --> 20:54.763
been running background
on every passenger on the plane.

20:54.787 --> 20:55.931
And?

20:55.955 --> 20:58.617
No red flags,
but there is one problem.

20:59.926 --> 21:00.903
Air marshal.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.104
Art Neeley.

21:02.128 --> 21:04.273
He was not originally assigned
to the flight.

21:04.297 --> 21:06.508
Requested an earlier departure
from Paris.

21:06.532 --> 21:07.977
TSA denied the request,

21:08.001 --> 21:10.346
so he switched duty assignments
with someone else.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.181
Really wanted to be
on this particular flight.

21:12.205 --> 21:13.549
Four days ago, where was he?

21:13.573 --> 21:15.551
According to his flight
schedule, Air Marshal Neeley

21:15.575 --> 21:18.120
was in DC when Sergeant Parsons
was murdered.

21:18.144 --> 21:19.488
Get Ziva on the phone.

21:19.512 --> 21:21.423
If Neeley is involved,
we don't want to spook

21:21.447 --> 21:24.507
the only other guy on that plane
that's got a gun.

21:34.060 --> 21:36.995
I think you got the wrong bag.

21:38.698 --> 21:40.757
You have a good eye.

21:42.168 --> 21:43.846
Hey, Ziva, I found your book.

21:43.870 --> 21:45.214
Thank you.

21:45.238 --> 21:46.939
Still studying
American history, huh?

21:48.574 --> 21:50.686
I just finished, uh,
The Twilight Saga.

21:50.710 --> 21:51.820
I've been suggesting it to her.

21:51.844 --> 21:53.255
It's very romantic.

21:53.279 --> 21:55.758
Excuse me.

21:55.782 --> 21:57.760
I just finished book four

21:57.784 --> 21:59.628
if you want to borrow it.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.984
Team Edward.

22:07.427 --> 22:09.238
Everything okay?

22:09.262 --> 22:10.539
Not really.

22:10.563 --> 22:12.574
She picked his pocket.

22:12.598 --> 22:15.260
One of the good guys
might not be.

22:16.602 --> 22:18.580
Psst.

22:18.604 --> 22:20.196
Honey.

22:21.574 --> 22:22.718
Call Abby, ask her to run.

22:22.742 --> 22:24.753
Neeley's incoming
and outgoing calls.

22:24.777 --> 22:26.574
On it, bossy.

22:32.218 --> 22:33.429
What?

22:33.453 --> 22:34.863
You guys say
you don't get along,

22:34.887 --> 22:36.098
but you make a great team.

22:36.122 --> 22:39.468
It is not always so smooth,
believe me.

22:39.492 --> 22:41.670
She's usually much snarkier.

22:41.694 --> 22:45.095
I think Paris changed her.

22:48.968 --> 22:51.980
Boss, I just got a call
from Navy Yard security.

22:52.004 --> 22:53.615
There's been an incident
at Beringer Marine.

22:53.639 --> 22:54.883
What happened?

22:54.907 --> 22:58.001
Nora's fiancé Daniel
attacked Ray Beringer.

22:59.011 --> 23:00.155
I lost my temper.

23:00.179 --> 23:01.490
You took
some candy-cane cheap shot

23:01.514 --> 23:02.491
at our prime suspect.

23:02.515 --> 23:03.492
It wasn't smart.

23:03.516 --> 23:06.061
I'm sorry.

23:06.085 --> 23:07.329
After a staff meeting,

23:07.353 --> 23:10.432
Beringer pulled me aside
and made a crack about Nora,

23:10.456 --> 23:12.735
about her taking vacation time.

23:12.759 --> 23:14.103
He's taunting me, Agent Gibbs.

23:14.127 --> 23:15.270
Maybe.

23:15.294 --> 23:17.139
It proves that he knows
about Nora, right?

23:17.163 --> 23:18.562
I mean, this should help you.

23:19.565 --> 23:21.276
He's the one

23:21.300 --> 23:23.145
who hired someone to kill her.

23:23.169 --> 23:27.006
You need to go home
and let us do our job.

23:29.275 --> 23:33.644
It's just I... I feel helpless.

23:41.821 --> 23:44.867
Kid's lucky I don't kick
his ass to the curb.

23:44.891 --> 23:47.169
Base security already
handled the situation.

23:47.193 --> 23:49.037
Why is NCIS here?

23:49.061 --> 23:51.291
Nora Williams.

23:52.331 --> 23:54.810
What about her?

23:54.834 --> 23:57.379
You tell me.

23:57.403 --> 24:01.016
I know she's a great employee

24:01.040 --> 24:02.951
and that she's sleeping
with that naive jerk

24:02.975 --> 24:04.620
who just clocked me.

24:04.644 --> 24:06.855
Like I told security,
it was just a joke.

24:06.879 --> 24:09.391
I like jokes.

24:09.415 --> 24:13.362
Nora works for me
at our Paris office.

24:13.386 --> 24:17.366
I heard she was taking
some... vacation time.

24:17.390 --> 24:20.102
Now, accountants are supposed
to be good with figures, right?

24:20.126 --> 24:22.571
So I asked Daniel if he was
going to get a chance...

24:22.595 --> 24:25.207
to use hers
while she was in town.

24:25.231 --> 24:27.743
I didn't mean anything by it.

24:27.767 --> 24:30.045
Unless I'm missing
something here.

24:30.069 --> 24:33.248
The kid's still angry
Nora took the transfer to Paris,

24:33.272 --> 24:35.551
took it out on me.

24:35.575 --> 24:37.319
Are we done?

24:37.343 --> 24:39.470
I got a company to run.

24:48.621 --> 24:50.599
What did Abby find?

24:50.623 --> 24:52.334
No connection
between our air marshal

24:52.358 --> 24:53.836
and our dead Marine.

24:53.860 --> 24:54.870
I still do not trust him.

24:54.894 --> 24:56.305
We should at least take
his weapon.

24:56.329 --> 24:58.440
If we are wrong,
we can apologize later.

24:58.464 --> 25:00.042
Where is our federal fly boy?

25:00.066 --> 25:02.110
Last time I saw him,
he was heading for the restroom.

25:02.134 --> 25:03.703
He has been in there
for a while.

25:04.937 --> 25:07.683
Maybe it was that vacuum-packed
sushi for dinner.

25:07.707 --> 25:10.185
I'm a little growly myself.

25:10.209 --> 25:11.870
Remain in your seat.

25:19.051 --> 25:21.821
Arty?

25:23.823 --> 25:26.155
You get sucked in?

25:27.159 --> 25:28.337
I'm gonna pick the lock.

25:28.361 --> 25:30.591
There is no need.

25:39.972 --> 25:42.150
His gun is missing.

25:42.174 --> 25:43.539
Is this the queue?

25:44.577 --> 25:46.855
Out of order.

25:46.879 --> 25:49.245
Someone made
quite a mess in there.

26:01.327 --> 26:02.905
Well, technically
flying still is

26:02.929 --> 26:04.540
the safest way to travel.

26:04.564 --> 26:05.841
Yeah?

26:05.865 --> 26:07.276
Tell that to him.

26:07.300 --> 26:10.979
Turns out Neeley was divorced
with a 12-year-old daughter.

26:11.003 --> 26:14.049
Requested the earlier flight
from Paris

26:14.073 --> 26:17.719
to get home in time to see
his daughter's school play.

26:17.743 --> 26:19.054
Well, we've got nothing
to tie Neeley

26:19.078 --> 26:20.556
to the first dead hit man,
so why risk

26:20.580 --> 26:23.058
murdering an air marshal
mid-flight?

26:23.082 --> 26:25.060
Well, he could have stumbled
onto something,

26:25.084 --> 26:26.595
got too close to our killer.

26:26.619 --> 26:28.630
Or they just wanted his gun.

26:28.654 --> 26:30.832
Either way...

26:30.856 --> 26:32.868
Confirms our killer
is on that plane.

26:32.892 --> 26:34.336
The closest airport
now is Dulles.

26:34.360 --> 26:37.573
They land in two hours.

26:37.597 --> 26:40.576
Heard you spoke to Ray Beringer.

26:40.600 --> 26:43.345
Word travels.

26:43.369 --> 26:45.414
Beringer made a call to SECNAV.

26:45.438 --> 26:49.251
He has the impression
that NCIS is investigating him.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.266
You had to shake that tree.

26:52.311 --> 26:54.590
Needed something to drop, Leon.

26:54.614 --> 26:55.924
Then you'll be pleased to know

26:55.948 --> 26:58.560
that Holly Snow's
plea deal came through.

26:58.584 --> 26:59.915
She's on her way back in.

27:07.326 --> 27:09.671
Ladies and gentleman, if I could
have your attention, please.

27:09.695 --> 27:11.139
Due to a mechanical issue,

27:11.163 --> 27:12.774
the forward lavatory
is out of order.

27:12.798 --> 27:14.009
We ask that you please use

27:14.033 --> 27:15.077
one of the other facilities
on board.

27:15.101 --> 27:17.703
Thank you.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.808
He's dead?

27:46.832 --> 27:49.211
Someone killed him?

27:49.235 --> 27:52.981
This is really happening,
isn't it?

27:53.005 --> 27:54.016
He's on the plane.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.031
So are we.

27:57.710 --> 27:59.688
How did it happen?

27:59.712 --> 28:01.890
It is not important.

28:01.914 --> 28:03.659
I'd like to know.

28:03.683 --> 28:04.960
A knitting needle.

28:04.984 --> 28:06.428
They took it
from a sleeping passenger

28:06.452 --> 28:08.988
and stabbed the air marshal
in the neck.

28:12.625 --> 28:14.770
You are so direct,

28:14.794 --> 28:19.231
so honest,
so different from him.

28:20.733 --> 28:25.313
Tony and I have, um,
different approaches.

28:25.337 --> 28:26.882
Yet complementary.

28:26.906 --> 28:28.483
You sure you two never?

28:28.507 --> 28:31.553
No. Positive.

28:31.577 --> 28:33.568
Definitely no.

28:35.614 --> 28:38.515
Why do you keep on asking
about Tony and I?

28:40.453 --> 28:44.266
You're like me and Daniel...
a good fit.

28:44.290 --> 28:46.134
Besides, Paris is
a romantic city,

28:46.158 --> 28:47.769
and you guys shared
a room, so I...

28:47.793 --> 28:49.805
I took the couch.

28:49.829 --> 28:52.741
Otherwise, Tony would have
whined the entire flight

28:52.765 --> 28:56.633
about his... his back.

28:58.637 --> 29:01.483
Talk about a nightmare
at 20,000 feet.

29:01.507 --> 29:04.319
"There's something on the wing.

29:04.343 --> 29:07.189
Some... thing."

29:07.213 --> 29:09.624
Classic Shatner doing
The Twilight Zone there, Ducky.

29:09.648 --> 29:12.427
I am well aware of that,
Anthony.

29:12.451 --> 29:15.430
Well, thank goodness
for this in-flight Wi-Fi.

29:15.454 --> 29:18.800
Does this qualify us
for, uh, mile-high club?

29:18.824 --> 29:20.068
Certainly not.

29:20.092 --> 29:21.269
I am surprised

29:21.293 --> 29:23.405
to hear that you are not
already a member.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.574
I never said I wasn't.

29:25.598 --> 29:27.709
Perhaps if you angled me
over and down a bit,

29:27.733 --> 29:30.178
- I could get a better view of his neck.
- Right, right, right.

29:30.202 --> 29:31.680
All right.

29:31.704 --> 29:34.116
Roger, dodger, you got that?

29:34.140 --> 29:35.584
Hmm, yes.

29:35.608 --> 29:39.087
The use of the knitting needle
was both crude and effective.

29:39.111 --> 29:42.357
He was aiming for the space
between the cervical vertebrae

29:42.381 --> 29:45.660
in an endeavor, no doubt,
to sever the spinal cord.

29:45.684 --> 29:47.429
Death would have been quick.

29:47.453 --> 29:48.797
And silent.

29:48.821 --> 29:50.532
He could have unlocked the door,
jabbed in the needle,

29:50.556 --> 29:52.667
and disappeared
with a minimum of fuss.

29:52.691 --> 29:56.872
If only we had high resolution,
I could confirm that hypothesis.

29:56.896 --> 29:59.307
All right,
hold on one second, Ducky.

29:59.331 --> 30:01.276
I've got an idea.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.211
Yeah.

30:03.235 --> 30:04.679
Here we go.

30:04.703 --> 30:09.606
You know, it looks like there's
a partial print on that needle.

30:11.343 --> 30:12.988
Oh, no.

30:13.012 --> 30:14.456
My memory card's full.

30:14.480 --> 30:17.959
That means I have to delete
some of my photos from Paris.

30:17.983 --> 30:19.494
If you have any of that pyramid

30:19.518 --> 30:21.997
outside the Louvre, delete them.

30:22.021 --> 30:25.500
That glass monstrosity is
an offense to good taste.

30:25.524 --> 30:27.235
It's like Sophie's Choice.

30:27.259 --> 30:30.057
"I can't choose."

30:32.064 --> 30:34.609
Doubt our hit man thought
we could process

30:34.633 --> 30:35.811
a mid-flight crime scene, Gibbs.

30:35.835 --> 30:37.712
Need the advantage, Abbs.

30:37.736 --> 30:39.414
Sorry.

30:39.438 --> 30:40.549
It's, uh, kitty litter.

30:40.573 --> 30:41.683
That stuff gets everywhere.

30:41.707 --> 30:43.318
I haven't had time
to clean up yet.

30:43.342 --> 30:44.443
See?

30:46.512 --> 30:48.657
- What do you got?
- Um...

30:48.681 --> 30:51.092
I have a bloody partial print
from the knitting needle.

30:51.116 --> 30:53.695
- Can you use it?
- Well, it's not your typical method

30:53.719 --> 30:55.697
of processing a print.

30:55.721 --> 30:57.165
I have the added work
of enhancing the photo

30:57.189 --> 30:58.834
and then translating the image

30:58.858 --> 31:00.502
into a format
that AFIS can understand

31:00.526 --> 31:02.337
before I can even begin
to search for a hit.

31:02.361 --> 31:04.339
- Yeah. Gibbs.
- Boss, the madam's here.

31:04.363 --> 31:05.660
Yeah, I'll be right up.

31:07.299 --> 31:09.444
Holly Snow.

31:09.468 --> 31:11.270
- Can I go?
- No. Print.

31:19.645 --> 31:21.423
The account clients use

31:21.447 --> 31:23.792
to send you the money...
let's have it.

31:23.816 --> 31:26.261
W-What, no foreplay,

31:26.285 --> 31:27.775
no seduction?

31:30.589 --> 31:32.033
My deal came through, then.

31:32.057 --> 31:33.401
Just needs a judge's signature.

31:33.425 --> 31:36.553
Hmm, well, why don't you
come back when you have it?

31:44.837 --> 31:47.048
Deal's done.

31:47.072 --> 31:49.632
United States Attorney approved.

31:55.014 --> 31:58.126
You like it rough, don't you?

31:58.150 --> 32:00.929
Well, there's a time and a place
for everything, Holly.

32:00.953 --> 32:03.319
I thought so.

32:05.491 --> 32:08.790
I'm usually pretty good
at reading people.

32:10.229 --> 32:12.220
What they respond to.

32:14.266 --> 32:16.244
Role-play?

32:16.268 --> 32:18.914
No.

32:18.938 --> 32:22.284
Hmm, too bad.

32:22.308 --> 32:25.436
Want to help out
the next victim?

32:27.046 --> 32:29.776
'Cause if she dies...

32:30.816 --> 32:33.114
this deal goes away.

32:34.520 --> 32:37.387
And we add another charge.

32:38.390 --> 32:40.620
Murder.

32:42.528 --> 32:44.587
I can read people, too.

32:49.101 --> 32:51.262
Account number.

33:11.090 --> 33:12.968
How can she sleep now?

33:12.992 --> 33:15.003
- To escape.
- Row 16.

33:15.027 --> 33:17.359
Isn't that the guy
Neeley said was acting strange?

33:20.666 --> 33:21.792
Yes.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.434
Excuse me. Sir.

33:32.845 --> 33:34.079
Stop.

33:35.114 --> 33:36.513
Move again, and I'll break it.

33:37.516 --> 33:38.526
Federal agents.

33:38.550 --> 33:39.728
Everybody relax.

33:39.752 --> 33:40.895
Return to your SkyMall.

33:40.919 --> 33:42.330
What the hell are you doing?

33:42.354 --> 33:43.465
What are you doing?

33:43.489 --> 33:45.066
I was just changing the battery

33:45.090 --> 33:47.202
in my CD player
when I dropped one.

33:47.226 --> 33:48.737
It rolled under the seats.

33:48.761 --> 33:50.405
Nobody buys CDs anymore.

33:50.429 --> 33:52.674
You have been acting strange
the entire flight.

33:52.698 --> 33:54.709
Yes, well, I am a bit angry.

33:54.733 --> 33:57.278
First, the airline refused
to seat me next to my wife,

33:57.302 --> 33:59.881
and then no one would move
when I asked them to switch.

33:59.905 --> 34:01.099
Selfish jerks!

34:02.107 --> 34:03.685
Hey! Relax, Battery Boy.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.711
Hold on.

34:10.382 --> 34:11.650
Here you go.

34:14.620 --> 34:17.431
Why don't you return
to your seat?

34:17.456 --> 34:19.234
Ziva.

34:19.257 --> 34:20.702
- What's wrong?
- Everybody, stay calm.

34:20.726 --> 34:21.770
Tony!

34:21.793 --> 34:23.351
Tony, she's in trouble!

34:25.563 --> 34:27.675
Oh, my God.

34:27.699 --> 34:29.935
Is this what I think it is?

34:29.960 --> 34:32.428
How did the killer get to her?

34:46.150 --> 34:47.696
Autopsy.

34:47.719 --> 34:49.331
Ducky, we've got a situation

34:49.355 --> 34:51.099
with our witness.

34:51.123 --> 34:53.168
Anthony, I can barely hear you.

34:53.192 --> 34:54.668
The reception's terrible.

34:54.693 --> 34:56.404
You still on that plane?

34:56.428 --> 34:58.139
Yeah. It's Nora.

34:58.163 --> 35:00.141
She's had some kind of reaction.
It's bad.

35:00.165 --> 35:01.343
What's her condition?

35:01.367 --> 35:02.644
Describe the symptoms.

35:02.668 --> 35:04.312
Well, she was sleeping,
and then...

35:04.336 --> 35:05.313
I guess she woke up.

35:05.337 --> 35:06.348
She was coughing and wheezing.

35:06.372 --> 35:08.083
She collapsed,
her lips are blue,

35:08.107 --> 35:09.284
and she's barely breathing.

35:09.308 --> 35:10.785
Are her lips and tongue swollen?

35:10.809 --> 35:12.320
Yeah.

35:12.344 --> 35:14.189
You think it's poison?

35:14.213 --> 35:16.625
No. It sounds to me
like a severe allergic reaction

35:16.649 --> 35:18.860
- causing anaphylaxis.
- An allergy?

35:18.884 --> 35:21.830
She needs an injection
of epinephrine, and quickly.

35:21.854 --> 35:23.014
We need an EpiPen.

35:24.356 --> 35:25.721
Her breathing's getting worse.

35:26.759 --> 35:29.304
There isn't one here.

35:29.328 --> 35:31.023
Here. Take mine.

35:32.164 --> 35:33.508
Tony, stop.

35:33.532 --> 35:34.976
Can we trust him? I mean,

35:35.000 --> 35:37.012
what if this whole thing
is just...

35:37.036 --> 35:38.526
We don't have a choice.

35:49.181 --> 35:51.183
Tony.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.231
Tony, what's happened?

35:56.255 --> 35:57.232
Is there any change?

35:57.256 --> 35:58.366
Ducky...

35:58.390 --> 35:59.768
the swelling's going down.

35:59.792 --> 36:01.369
Oh, good.

36:01.393 --> 36:04.439
Now... now, it's important
that you keep her on oxygen

36:04.463 --> 36:08.365
and monitor her breathing
until you land.

36:10.569 --> 36:11.913
Ducky, how did this happen?

36:11.937 --> 36:14.015
She has not eaten anything.

36:14.039 --> 36:16.084
Tony said she was sleeping.

36:16.108 --> 36:18.219
Yes, we have been with her
the entire time.

36:18.243 --> 36:19.821
Did she touch anything?

36:19.845 --> 36:21.957
No, just...

36:21.981 --> 36:23.778
a pillow.

36:24.817 --> 36:26.361
Nuts.

36:26.385 --> 36:28.563
- Nothing?
- No, nuts.

36:28.587 --> 36:31.566
The pillow has been lined
with peanut dust.

36:31.590 --> 36:34.269
She must have inhaled it
when she slept.

36:34.293 --> 36:37.605
That can be a...
a-a virulent allergy.

36:37.629 --> 36:39.240
Yeah.

36:39.264 --> 36:43.478
Your assailant clearly
has done his due diligence.

36:43.502 --> 36:45.647
Excuse me.

36:45.671 --> 36:48.071
Which flight
attendant gave her the pillow?

36:51.577 --> 36:53.054
I got a match, Gibbs,

36:53.078 --> 36:54.923
on the bloody partial print.

36:54.947 --> 36:57.392
It belongs to one
of the flight attendants.

36:57.416 --> 36:59.728
Tiffany Chase. And...

36:59.752 --> 37:02.230
her flight schedule shows
that she was in DC

37:02.254 --> 37:04.666
the day that Sergeant Parsons
was killed in his condo.

37:04.690 --> 37:05.967
Bank records?

37:05.991 --> 37:07.602
Okay, you know,
that's not really my forte,

37:07.626 --> 37:08.903
but Tony and Ziva are gone,

37:08.927 --> 37:10.238
and McGee's been
really busy, so...

37:10.262 --> 37:12.107
- Abby.
- Um, all right.

37:12.131 --> 37:15.610
I found periodic deposits,
and big ones.

37:15.634 --> 37:17.261
All from anonymous
online accounts.

37:20.339 --> 37:21.449
These are contract payouts.

37:21.473 --> 37:23.184
I don't know
if this is her first

37:23.208 --> 37:25.487
in-flight murder,
but it looks like Tiffany Chase

37:25.511 --> 37:29.591
has been using her airline job
to cover travel and kill people

37:29.615 --> 37:31.593
and split town
from anywhere in the world.

37:31.617 --> 37:33.428
Another killer with a day job.

37:33.452 --> 37:35.130
Call Tony.

37:35.154 --> 37:37.799
Hey, McGee.

37:37.823 --> 37:39.801
Yeah, uh, boss, I ran the number

37:39.825 --> 37:41.036
that Holly Snow gave us.

37:41.060 --> 37:42.270
It's an offshore account.

37:42.294 --> 37:43.838
Last deposit
was made four days ago.

37:43.862 --> 37:45.173
Half a million dollars.

37:45.197 --> 37:46.341
Money is still there.

37:46.365 --> 37:47.675
Who paid to have Nora killed?

37:47.699 --> 37:50.145
Tracked the cash back
to Beringer Marine.

37:50.169 --> 37:52.147
It's an account
that only two people

37:52.171 --> 37:53.681
Nora Williams

37:53.705 --> 37:55.183
and Ray Beringer himself.

37:55.207 --> 37:57.085
Folks, this is Captain Demerest.

37:57.109 --> 37:59.988
We're about to start our
final descent into Washington.

38:00.012 --> 38:01.423
Please return to your seats

38:01.447 --> 38:03.658
and fasten your seat belts
securely.

38:03.682 --> 38:06.194
Flight crew,
prepare the cabin for arrival.

38:06.218 --> 38:08.209
Serving dinner again?

38:09.555 --> 38:10.732
It wasn't that good

38:10.756 --> 38:12.700
the first time.

38:12.724 --> 38:14.783
Is that where you hid
the air marshal's gun?

38:33.145 --> 38:35.723
Talk about snakes on a plane.

38:35.747 --> 38:38.307
I'll take that hot towel now.

38:42.087 --> 38:44.385
Excuse me. I'm in the middle
of a conference call.

38:45.757 --> 38:47.869
I already talked
to the Secretary of the Navy.

38:47.893 --> 38:48.870
It seems
there's some misunderstanding

38:48.894 --> 38:50.171
in this investigation.

38:50.195 --> 38:51.940
Investigation's over.
You're under arrest.

38:51.964 --> 38:53.441
Put your hands behind your back.

38:53.465 --> 38:55.009
For what?!

38:55.033 --> 38:57.178
Hiring someone
to kill Nora Williams.

38:57.202 --> 38:59.347
Money was transferred
from this company.

38:59.371 --> 39:01.683
You're the only one
with access to it.

39:01.707 --> 39:03.551
I never hired anyone...

39:03.575 --> 39:05.320
I thought this was about fraud.

39:05.344 --> 39:07.222
That's why you needed Nora dead.

39:07.246 --> 39:09.591
She was the only other person
with access to the account.

39:09.615 --> 39:10.925
Well, arrest her, then.

39:10.949 --> 39:14.262
Look, you can check the log.

39:14.286 --> 39:16.598
I never transferred any money.

39:16.622 --> 39:17.765
So, what,

39:17.789 --> 39:19.313
Nora put a hit on herself?

39:27.966 --> 39:29.844
Hey, Daniel!

39:29.868 --> 39:32.166
Stop!

39:45.117 --> 39:46.351
McGee!

39:56.028 --> 39:57.972
Boss,

39:57.996 --> 39:59.623
I'm gonna call an ambulance.

40:00.666 --> 40:02.277
Boss?

40:02.301 --> 40:04.360
Boss, are you okay?

40:07.172 --> 40:09.766
Did you, uh...
Did you hit your shoulder?

40:11.243 --> 40:12.887
No.

40:12.911 --> 40:14.746
The car did, McGee.

40:19.251 --> 40:21.913
Cuff him.

40:35.567 --> 40:37.312
Uh-huh. Yeah.

40:37.336 --> 40:38.913
They're taking her out now.

40:38.937 --> 40:40.481
Flight attendants
will never be the same.

40:40.505 --> 40:42.016
How are you feeling?

40:42.040 --> 40:43.218
Better.

40:43.242 --> 40:44.586
Thank you. Both.

40:44.610 --> 40:47.121
So you still want to testify
after all of this?

40:47.145 --> 40:48.489
Of course.

40:48.513 --> 40:50.525
You guys did your part.
Now I have to do mine.

40:50.549 --> 40:51.693
Okay.

40:51.717 --> 40:52.961
Yup, got it, boss.

40:52.985 --> 40:54.162
Right.

40:54.186 --> 40:56.764
I told you

40:56.788 --> 40:58.766
I liked happy endings.

40:58.790 --> 41:01.493
I can't wait to see Daniel
after all this.

41:03.528 --> 41:04.906
Yeah.

41:04.930 --> 41:07.141
About that...

41:07.165 --> 41:09.978
Oh, yeah.

41:10.002 --> 41:12.146
Champ du Mars.

41:12.170 --> 41:14.682
Bogey and Bergman
will always have Paris.

41:14.706 --> 41:16.351
Now, so will we.

41:16.375 --> 41:18.486
I guess Nora won't,

41:18.510 --> 41:21.823
seeing as her, uh, own fiancé
used company money

41:21.847 --> 41:23.091
to try and have her killed.

41:23.115 --> 41:24.626
That's got to sting.

41:24.650 --> 41:26.728
Yeah, well, Nora's testimony
was going to expose him, too.

41:26.752 --> 41:28.096
Beringer stole from the Navy.

41:28.120 --> 41:29.530
Daniel stole from Beringer.

41:29.554 --> 41:31.499
How did she take it, by the way?

41:31.523 --> 41:33.101
Pretty hard, even for her.

41:33.125 --> 41:34.502
Rule number 12.

41:34.526 --> 41:36.137
Hey, boss.

41:36.161 --> 41:37.685
How's the shoulder?

41:41.533 --> 41:43.911
Boy, McGee, when you blow it,
you blow it big.

41:43.935 --> 41:45.146
DiNozzo, it was an accident.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.081
- MTAC, McGee.
- Yes, boss.

41:47.105 --> 41:50.151
Hey, in Paris,
who got stuck with the couch?

41:50.175 --> 41:51.552
Me. We flipped a coin.

41:51.576 --> 41:53.544
Well, tough break.

41:57.416 --> 41:59.494
Why did you just lie to McGee?

41:59.518 --> 42:01.782
Why did you lie to Nora?

42:04.690 --> 42:07.001
Nora was right.

42:07.025 --> 42:08.736
Found my favorite picture,

42:08.760 --> 42:12.218
and it's the only one
with someone in it.

42:16.535 --> 42:18.513
Very French New Wave,
don't you think?

42:18.537 --> 42:20.334
Maybe.

42:25.277 --> 42:27.302
I think it would look
better in black-and-white.
