01:57.050 --> 02:00.315
[Crowd cheering, faint]

02:12.632 --> 02:15.328
[Calliope playing]

02:25.111 --> 02:27.511
[Man] Now, you gotta use
your imagination here, okay?

02:27.614 --> 02:29.809
Don't judge a book by its cover.

02:32.185 --> 02:35.586
This used to be Westinghouse
Appliance Manufacturing.

02:35.655 --> 02:40.456
This sits on a 14-acre lot.
This floor alone, 20,000 square feet.

02:40.527 --> 02:42.188
Tell me about Ohio, gentlemen.

02:42.295 --> 02:45.162
- Most astronauts and most presidents.
- Really?

02:45.265 --> 02:48.496
I think 25 astronauts
and eight presidents so far.

02:48.601 --> 02:49.625
[In Chinese] Ms. Zhang, please.

02:49.702 --> 02:52.865
I don't think your father would agree.

02:52.972 --> 02:55.964
[In English] No, no. I like it here, Bao.

02:56.976 --> 02:58.773
I like both buildings.

03:00.980 --> 03:05.110
[Ms. Zhang] Car manufacturers,
steel mills, electrical appliances.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.948
People here lost it all.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.147
They really wanna work.
You can see it in their eyes.

03:09.222 --> 03:12.020
I think this is a really good move.

03:12.125 --> 03:14.958
- Hold on, Daya.
- [In Chinese] Dad, please trust me.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.620
[In English] Daya, hold on, hold on.

03:17.964 --> 03:21.832
[In Chinese] The royal family knows
we built this in the hull of a ship.

03:21.901 --> 03:26.167
They asked if we could build one
under the desert.

03:28.741 --> 03:31.039
Twelve billion. Half in advance.

03:36.716 --> 03:41.016
[In English] Honey, opening plants outside
of China may not play so well here.

03:41.087 --> 03:44.818
But bringing jobs into America
will help our worldwide brand.

03:44.891 --> 03:47.416
I think it would be a good move.

03:47.527 --> 03:50.394
Both sides win.
I really want to do this.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.596
Okay?

03:54.100 --> 03:57.729
So, 25 astronauts and eight presidents?

03:57.837 --> 03:59.361
So far.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.598
China's coming to Mansfield.

04:02.709 --> 04:05.041
Fantastic! Thank you.

04:09.682 --> 04:12.014
[Thunder rumbling]

04:34.307 --> 04:36.366
We are so glad Zhang Innovations

04:36.442 --> 04:38.307
is considering Mansfield for investment,

04:38.411 --> 04:41.278
and we are gonna do whatever it takes
to get that deal done for you.

04:41.381 --> 04:44.111
[Daya] Thank you, Mr. Mayor. We were
very pleased with everything that we saw.

04:44.217 --> 04:47.209
- We'll definitely be in touch.
- Fantastic. I look forward to your call.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.152
- And safe travels.
- Thank you.

04:50.089 --> 04:51.556
[In Chinese] This way, Ms. Zhang.

04:53.826 --> 04:56.886
Your bodyguard never relaxes.
He doesn't take his eyes off you.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.594
I know.

04:58.665 --> 05:00.428
He is very thorough.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.730
But it is difficult
to fill the shoes of Shen.

05:03.770 --> 05:05.101
Your father hated Shen.

05:06.072 --> 05:09.064
Shen did nothing wrong but love me.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.509
[Thunder continues rumbling]

05:19.118 --> 05:20.676
[Object clatters on floor]

05:39.372 --> 05:40.964
[Screams]

05:52.352 --> 05:53.216
Ah!

05:56.689 --> 05:57.986
[Gasps]

06:01.828 --> 06:04.023
- [Groans]
- [Screaming]

06:38.164 --> 06:40.428
[Woman in English] Seventh floor,
there's a pretty receptionist.

06:40.533 --> 06:42.398
If you can charm your way through her,

06:42.502 --> 06:44.367
you can avoid security altogether.

06:44.437 --> 06:46.428
[Man] Abigail, I was thinking
about what you were saying

06:46.539 --> 06:48.404
about us moving in together.

06:48.508 --> 06:52.569
You know, I think it's a pretty good idea,
except for one small thing.

06:54.046 --> 06:56.037
I think it's called "snoring."

06:56.115 --> 06:58.345
- What? Get out of here! I don't snore.
- [Laughs]

06:58.418 --> 07:00.352
If it ain't you, I don't know who it is.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.548
But I could put something,
maybe a cork or something,

07:03.623 --> 07:06.615
and it'll keep you a little more quiet.

07:06.726 --> 07:09.251
[Abigail]
All right, Ray, we gotta focus.

07:09.362 --> 07:11.455
We need to get that disk
and make sure our names aren't tied

07:11.564 --> 07:15.227
to your ex-partner's black site activity,
and we sleep better.

07:15.301 --> 07:17.565
And when I sleep better,
I wake up happy, and I'm sweet,

07:17.637 --> 07:19.434
and you'll get breakfast in bed.

07:21.574 --> 07:23.804
All right, Abigail, that's a deal.

07:23.910 --> 07:25.207
I love you, Ray.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.936
I love you too.

07:35.955 --> 07:37.547
[Elevator bell dings]

07:55.508 --> 07:57.738
Mr. Chow, please.

07:57.810 --> 08:00.404
May I tell him what this is regarding?

08:00.480 --> 08:03.074
- No.
- No?

08:06.652 --> 08:10.144
- It's a surprise.
- He's not big on surprises.

08:10.256 --> 08:12.486
- Your name?
- Friend.

08:15.661 --> 08:17.822
- [Beep]
- [Line rings]

08:17.930 --> 08:20.262
Mr. Friend is here.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.927
Yes, Mr. Friend.

08:23.002 --> 08:27.302
Chinese, with a briefcase
and an umbrella.

08:28.708 --> 08:32.041
No, sir, not raining. Mm-hmm.

08:35.648 --> 08:37.206
Be right with you, Mr. Friend.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.148
Thank you.

08:50.329 --> 08:51.796
- [Beeping]
- [Lock clicks]

09:06.412 --> 09:09.006

- [Door opens]

Sir?

10:25.257 --> 10:27.885
[Groaning]

10:40.473 --> 10:41.838
Surprise.

10:41.941 --> 10:44.000
- [Groaning]
- [Clattering]

10:46.512 --> 10:47.911
[Beep]

11:10.870 --> 11:12.497
[Gun cocks]

11:14.507 --> 11:16.668
I want that.

11:16.776 --> 11:19.438
- I want it too.
- Give me the disk.

11:19.512 --> 11:22.675
You're not gonna shoot me, Ray Breslin.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.844
- [Gun uncocks]
- What's your name?

11:25.951 --> 11:28.146
- Shen Lo.
- We're gonna see what's on that disk.

11:28.220 --> 11:31.314
And if I'm satisfied,
then you can have it.

11:32.391 --> 11:33.790
Walk.

11:44.003 --> 11:45.903
[Woman] Obviously,
these guys were professionals.

11:46.005 --> 11:47.802
I think we can agree on that.

11:47.873 --> 11:50.671
They knew your timetable.
They knew where you were gonna be.

11:50.743 --> 11:53.712
They knew when she was leaving.
They knew when to be at the hangar.

11:53.813 --> 11:56.577
I'm gonna be honest with you.
We've got nothing.

11:57.516 --> 12:01.077
This was your detail.

12:01.187 --> 12:03.348
You were responsible for her.

12:03.422 --> 12:06.050
Look, as I told him, we came into town...

12:06.158 --> 12:08.058
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we've heard all that.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.321
You're in town,
you're looking at real estate.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.421
- I'm telling you the truth.
- Was there anything different?

12:12.531 --> 12:14.396
Was there something
that stood out to you?

12:14.500 --> 12:16.058
None of this is making sense.

12:16.168 --> 12:18.602
[Man] All right, just think about it,
from the beginning.

12:18.704 --> 12:20.171
What was the first thing you saw?

12:20.239 --> 12:21.866
What's the first thing you remember?

12:21.941 --> 12:23.431
[Woman]
What can you tell us?

12:23.542 --> 12:26.443
There's gotta be something you can
tell us, something that happened.

12:26.545 --> 12:30.447
You're the only person that's alive.
I certainly can't ask them.

12:30.549 --> 12:32.676
[Woman]
You were responsible for her.

13:12.391 --> 13:13.323
[In Chinese] Tell me.

13:14.226 --> 13:15.215
Who took her?

13:16.996 --> 13:19.157
- I don't know.
- You have to know.

13:20.566 --> 13:21.658
I don't.

13:25.304 --> 13:28.637
You are supposed to protect my daughter
with your life.

13:29.441 --> 13:31.341
If you did your job right, you'd be dead.

13:32.778 --> 13:34.473
- [Chinese]
- [Chinese]

13:34.580 --> 13:36.605
[In English]
Hey, hey! Whoa! Get him outta here!

13:36.682 --> 13:38.650
- [Shouting in Chinese]
- That's enough, that's enough!

13:38.751 --> 13:39.979
Get him outta here! Get him outta here!

13:40.085 --> 13:42.349
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

13:42.454 --> 13:45.514
[Zhang] Take your hands off me!
Don't touch me!

13:45.624 --> 13:48.684
- Have a seat. I'm not done with you.
- Let go!

13:49.662 --> 13:51.789
[Zhang, faint]
Don't touch me!

14:22.862 --> 14:24.523
[Train horn blows]

14:28.033 --> 14:29.694
[Train horn blows]

14:36.242 --> 14:38.710
If that disk is clear,
you can be on your way.

14:38.811 --> 14:41.041
Am I supposed to say thank you?

14:41.146 --> 14:42.477
This is Shen Lo.

14:42.548 --> 14:45.039
- Hello. Very nice to meet you.
- Hi.

14:45.150 --> 14:47.380
Everything's set.
Hush and Abigail are waiting.

14:47.486 --> 14:48.885
[Ray] Okay.

14:48.988 --> 14:51.650
- Ray, have you got a second?
- I know what you're gonna say.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.021
I'm ready to get up from behind this desk

14:53.092 --> 14:56.084
if you wanna accidentally
give me a chance.

14:56.195 --> 14:57.822
I'll think about it.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.614
- All good?
- Clear.

15:17.549 --> 15:19.744
Nothing to tie you to him.

15:19.852 --> 15:21.843
You mean Zhang?

15:23.222 --> 15:25.952
What are you looking for?

15:26.058 --> 15:28.856
- I know you were in business with Zhang.
- Do you?

15:28.928 --> 15:31.920
Your partner was.
Zhang financed your company.

15:32.031 --> 15:34.431
- We had nothing to do with that.
- [Hush] Lester did.

15:34.533 --> 15:36.467
And how do you know that?

15:36.568 --> 15:39.469
I worked for him.
Head of security for Zhang.

15:39.571 --> 15:41.539
Let me set you straight.

15:41.607 --> 15:44.303
Lester did the business, not me.

15:44.410 --> 15:47.038
Maybe it's time for me
to interject into the conversation

15:47.112 --> 15:49.740
that they have offered
double your standard fee.

15:49.815 --> 15:51.112
That's five mil, Ray.

15:51.216 --> 15:53.480
- So you like this?
- Yes, I like it very much.

15:53.585 --> 15:56.383
From a financial standpoint, I like it.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.821
Why are you going after Zhang now?

15:58.924 --> 16:03.759
All the technology behind all of these
black site prisons is Zhang's.

16:03.829 --> 16:06.161
But you know that already, don't you?

16:06.265 --> 16:07.664
What's your point?

16:07.766 --> 16:09.427
My point.

16:09.501 --> 16:10.832
Look at the data.

16:10.936 --> 16:13.996
Zhang's technology has made him billions

16:14.106 --> 16:16.973
on imprisoning and torturing
thousands of people.

16:17.076 --> 16:20.978
Zhang Innovations
is how he cleans that money.

16:26.185 --> 16:29.416
I'm gonna bring him down. It's personal.

16:29.488 --> 16:32.753
You wanna go after Zhang,
do it yourself.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.453
We had no idea what was going on
behind our backs.

16:35.527 --> 16:38.462
It's dead, and it's history.
That's it.

16:39.498 --> 16:40.931
[Hush] We're clean now.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.369
All right, so where is Lester Clark now?

16:47.006 --> 16:48.940
Haven't seen him for a long time.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.976
But I heard...

16:51.043 --> 16:53.136
he went on a long cruise...

16:55.114 --> 16:56.706
and never came back.

16:58.650 --> 17:00.515
Sleepy time, motherfucker.

17:08.660 --> 17:10.127
[Grunts] Fuck!

17:12.364 --> 17:15.993
- [Engine cranking]
- No, no, no, no! Come on, come on.

17:18.670 --> 17:20.399
Fuck!

17:20.506 --> 17:22.633
Ray!

17:28.013 --> 17:30.004
[Woman]
Excuse me, Ray.

17:30.883 --> 17:31.975
There's a man up front.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.383
He said he found us
through an Interpol contact.

17:34.486 --> 17:37.717
- Claims he has something you need to see.
- All right, just bring him in.

17:44.229 --> 17:46.891
Can I help you?

17:46.999 --> 17:49.490
My name is Bao Yung.
I'm looking for Ray Breslin.

17:50.202 --> 17:51.226
Right here.

17:51.336 --> 17:52.997
This is for you.

18:12.624 --> 18:15.115
What goes around, comes around.

18:15.227 --> 18:19.220
Ray Breslin, by the time you see this,
I'll have Daya Zhang,

18:19.298 --> 18:20.697
and I'll be coming for you.

18:20.766 --> 18:21.960
Daya.

18:23.535 --> 18:25.366
- Is that...
- Yeah.

18:25.437 --> 18:29.533
- Who is it?
- Lester Clark Jr. My ex-partner's son.

18:31.276 --> 18:32.106
Who are you?

18:32.211 --> 18:34.702
I was head of security
at Zhang Innovations.

18:35.981 --> 18:37.778
Daya Zhang was kidnapped.

18:38.884 --> 18:40.977
[In Chinese] Why are you here
instead of looking for her?

18:41.086 --> 18:42.246
It's not my fault.

18:42.321 --> 18:43.879
If it's not your fault, whose fault is it?

18:43.956 --> 18:44.945
Hey!

18:45.057 --> 18:46.991
Come on.

18:47.092 --> 18:48.218
Focus.

18:50.429 --> 18:53.330
- Where's this place?
- Hush, go closer.

18:53.432 --> 18:54.558
On the wall.

18:56.802 --> 19:00.294
That. That picture.
"Daniel in the Lions' Den."

19:00.405 --> 19:02.134
- The patron saint of prisoners.
- Right.

19:02.241 --> 19:03.731
That's a prison chapel.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.572
- Eastern Orthodox, maybe?
- [Abigail] Yeah.

19:05.644 --> 19:07.839
- But the writing's in Russian.
- Yeah, it's probably Eastern Bloc.

19:07.946 --> 19:10.278
- Jules, get Trent.
- [Jules] On it.

19:17.422 --> 19:18.616
[Latches click]

19:21.593 --> 19:24.790
[Speakers: Club music playing, faint]

[Phone buzzing]

19:35.707 --> 19:37.698
[Foreign language]

19:40.779 --> 19:42.212
- What's up, Ray?
- [Ray] Hey, my friend.

19:42.314 --> 19:44.043
- Did you get the video?
- Yeah.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.340
Yeah, I did. What's going down?

19:46.451 --> 19:48.976
My ex-partner's kid went off the rails.

19:49.054 --> 19:51.113
Yeah, obviously.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.818
- Where do you think this place is?
- Definitely looks familiar.

19:53.892 --> 19:55.359
How familiar?

19:55.460 --> 19:59.294
- Not many of these places left.
- All right, so what's your call?

20:00.532 --> 20:01.897
Devil's Station.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.726
Bad place, Ray.

20:04.836 --> 20:06.736
About 200 miles outside of Belarus.

20:06.838 --> 20:08.999
Okay, Mr. Skinny,
can you help me out on this?

20:09.074 --> 20:11.634
For free? I'm just kidding.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.803
- I'll take care of the transportation.
- All right.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.710
We'll be there tomorrow. I owe you.

20:17.082 --> 20:18.913
Yeah, what's new?

20:19.017 --> 20:21.884
You sure you don't wanna sit this one out?

20:21.987 --> 20:24.979
No way. Let you have all the fun?

20:25.824 --> 20:27.223
We got Hush back here.

20:27.326 --> 20:29.886
I'll go pack our bags, get the gear,
be back in an hour.

20:29.995 --> 20:31.326
You got it.

20:31.396 --> 20:33.091
I'm coming along.

20:34.366 --> 20:36.197
When you said personal, how personal?

20:36.268 --> 20:40.534
I was very close to Daya.
I have to go.

20:42.341 --> 20:44.571
Let's go, mystery man.

20:44.676 --> 20:46.576
And you, don't break anything.

20:46.678 --> 20:49.010
[Chuckles]

21:13.772 --> 21:16.206
[Banging]

21:17.109 --> 21:20.476
[Daya whimpering, gasping]

21:28.553 --> 21:30.453
My father can pay for all of us.

21:30.555 --> 21:31.749
Quiet.

21:37.229 --> 21:38.560
[Gasps]

22:13.498 --> 22:15.432
[Speaking Chinese]

22:15.500 --> 22:17.161
No talking!

22:19.705 --> 22:21.138
What do you want?

22:22.274 --> 22:25.437
Please. Please don't do this.
Okay?

22:25.510 --> 22:28.138
[Crying]
We can work something out.

22:28.213 --> 22:29.771
Please, please.

22:29.848 --> 22:31.941
We're not animals.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.507
We have rules.

22:33.618 --> 22:36.712
What's the point of having rules
if people are gonna break 'em?

22:36.822 --> 22:39.052
[Man speaking Chinese]

22:42.160 --> 22:43.787
[Whimpers] Wait.

22:46.298 --> 22:48.732
[Gasping]

22:48.834 --> 22:50.802
- This your friend?
- [Speaking Chinese]

22:50.869 --> 22:52.894
- Hey.
- [Daya] Just please don't hurt him, okay?

22:53.004 --> 22:54.494
L-lt won't happen again.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.501
I-I promise.

22:57.576 --> 22:59.237
I didn't hurt him.

22:59.344 --> 23:01.710
- You did.
- What?

23:03.648 --> 23:06.242
- [Screaming]
- [Daya screaming]

23:07.886 --> 23:09.854
[Sobbing] No.

23:14.926 --> 23:16.655
- Continue.
- All right, go! Come on!

23:16.728 --> 23:18.218
Go!

23:18.463 --> 23:20.931
[In Chinese] You were head of security
for Zhang Innovations.

23:21.032 --> 23:22.226
Yes.

23:24.536 --> 23:29.064
And you were with Interpol, yes?

23:29.908 --> 23:30.738
Yes.

23:36.948 --> 23:39.246
How could you let this happen?

23:39.684 --> 23:43.518
I would've given my life to save her
if I could have.

23:44.890 --> 23:46.949
It's too late to say that.

23:51.863 --> 23:54.058
[In English] Glock.34,

23:54.132 --> 23:57.033
nine millimeter, long slide.

23:57.969 --> 23:59.527
[In Chinese] Fancy.

24:01.239 --> 24:05.903
And when they took Daya,
where was your fancy gun then?

24:11.817 --> 24:13.614
You failed her.

24:29.801 --> 24:30.995
I know.

25:24.456 --> 25:25.980
[Buzzing]

25:26.057 --> 25:28.855
- Hey there.
- I'm here. Sorry it took a little longer.

25:28.960 --> 25:31.656
Don't worry about it.
I got tons of stuff to do here.

25:31.730 --> 25:33.789
All right, plane's waiting.
It's gonna be a long flight.

25:33.865 --> 25:36.197
- We can have breakfast in bed.
- [Ray] Sounds good, Abigail.

25:36.301 --> 25:38.462
[Muffled screaming]

25:38.537 --> 25:40.732
- [Muffled screaming continues]
- Abby?

25:41.706 --> 25:43.401
Abby!

25:43.508 --> 25:46.636
[Screaming continues]

25:48.213 --> 25:49.578
- Abby!
- Ray!

25:55.420 --> 25:57.547
Fuck you! Ray!

26:00.258 --> 26:01.486
Abby?

26:02.727 --> 26:03.819
Abby!

26:04.763 --> 26:06.060
Abby!

26:06.164 --> 26:08.029
[Phone beeping]

26:16.207 --> 26:17.572
Fuck.

26:19.611 --> 26:21.670
Damn it!

26:21.746 --> 26:22.678
Abby!

26:22.747 --> 26:24.510
Why hasn't he called yet?

26:24.583 --> 26:26.710
These things can go different ways.

26:26.785 --> 26:29.720
- What does that mean?
- Are you sure you don't have any enemies?

26:29.788 --> 26:31.722
I have the number one
tech company in China.

26:31.790 --> 26:35.385
There are 1.3 billion people in China,
and everyone uses my phone.

26:35.460 --> 26:37.291
Yes, I have enemies.

26:37.395 --> 26:40.558
Don't you think you should bring some
assistance here from Cleveland or Chicago?

26:40.632 --> 26:44.033
There's no one you can think of
that would want to harm your daughter?

26:44.903 --> 26:46.734
[Phone ringing]

26:47.939 --> 26:49.634
Let it ring twice.

26:50.942 --> 26:53.069
[Rings]

26:54.980 --> 26:56.743
- Hello?
- Zhang.

26:56.815 --> 26:58.112
What do you want?

26:59.818 --> 27:01.376
Encrypted.

27:01.453 --> 27:03.318
You could've helped my father.

27:03.421 --> 27:06.390
He put your sick technology
in every one of his black site prisons,

27:06.458 --> 27:08.449
and you kept your hands clean.

27:11.596 --> 27:15.623
Now, when this is done,
I'm gonna take your money,

27:15.734 --> 27:18.225
I'm gonna take your technology,
and I'm gonna break you.

27:18.303 --> 27:21.898
Before, I wanted $500 million.

27:21.973 --> 27:25.431
Now I want $700 million,
and it's going up.

27:26.778 --> 27:27.767
Watch.

27:36.254 --> 27:38.814
[Gasping, whimpering]

27:52.203 --> 27:54.000
This is what funds our operation.

27:54.939 --> 27:56.634
Paid by countries and corporations

27:56.708 --> 27:58.699
to take the worst of the worst
off their hands.

27:58.810 --> 28:02.109
Now, I'd kill 'em,
but the checks keep on coming.

28:03.348 --> 28:04.372
Murderers.

28:05.550 --> 28:07.643
Serial rapists.

28:07.719 --> 28:10.847
Terrorists, hackers, narcos.

28:10.955 --> 28:12.980
The scum of the earth.

28:13.058 --> 28:17.688
The world is full of scum
like your father.

28:19.364 --> 28:21.389
But you know that, right?

28:23.068 --> 28:24.831
[Gasping]

28:42.053 --> 28:43.577
Lock 'em up!

28:43.688 --> 28:45.383
[Doors slam closed]

28:45.490 --> 28:46.889
I love that sound.

28:54.232 --> 28:58.225
[Whimpering, crying]

29:21.059 --> 29:24.222
- What are you doing?
- She was my responsibility.

29:24.295 --> 29:27.230
- Come on. We gotta go.
- [Engine starts]

29:42.781 --> 29:45.477
[Coughing]

29:57.896 --> 30:01.093
It's an electric chair
that was built in 1896.

30:01.900 --> 30:04.334
It's, uh, solid oak.

30:04.435 --> 30:06.494
It's as American as apple pie.

30:06.604 --> 30:11.007
Three hundred and 15 people died
in that chair, including three women.

30:11.109 --> 30:16.069
They used to, uh... They used to put
a hood like this over the inmate's head,

30:16.147 --> 30:18.615
but first they would
put cotton and tape over their eyes

30:18.683 --> 30:22.517
so they didn't pop out
when they fried 'em from the inside.

30:27.125 --> 30:29.286
You know who I am?

30:30.795 --> 30:32.854
My father built your company.

30:34.265 --> 30:37.928
Ray Breslin took over,
pushed him out.

30:39.103 --> 30:40.195
That's not true.

30:41.706 --> 30:43.264
[In foreign language] Bullshit.

30:52.684 --> 30:55.551
[In English]
I had nothing to do with what happened.

30:56.621 --> 30:58.555
Yeah.

30:58.656 --> 31:00.123
Yeah, but you were there.

31:01.226 --> 31:02.853
So you're part of it.

31:37.562 --> 31:39.496
There you go.

31:39.564 --> 31:41.031
Couldn't do this without you, man.

31:41.099 --> 31:44.091
I'm sorry about Abby.
We'll set it straight.

31:44.202 --> 31:45.829
Yeah.

31:46.504 --> 31:48.734
This is Shen Lo.

31:48.840 --> 31:50.273
Excuse me.

31:50.375 --> 31:52.775
[Ray] He doesn't have a lot to say.

31:52.877 --> 31:54.777
- You know Jules.
- [Trent] Hey, Jules.

31:55.346 --> 31:56.608
And Bao Yung.

31:56.714 --> 31:57.772
- Security?
- Mm-hmm.

31:57.882 --> 32:00.009
I've lost an asset before.

32:00.084 --> 32:02.518
- Really?
- No.

32:02.587 --> 32:04.179
Never.

32:04.255 --> 32:06.780
- That's not funny.
- Sure it is.

32:08.927 --> 32:11.191
[Line ringing]

32:11.262 --> 32:12.126
[Shen Lo in Chinese] Mr. Zhang.

32:12.764 --> 32:13.628
[Zhang] Luoshen.

32:14.265 --> 32:16.256
You know about my situation?

32:16.901 --> 32:19.301
I know that Daya was kidnapped.

32:19.404 --> 32:20.769
I can save her.

32:22.974 --> 32:25.465
Shen. Shen!

32:27.312 --> 32:30.543
If you want her alive, do what I say.

32:31.983 --> 32:32.972
Luoshen.

32:34.085 --> 32:35.552
I only wanted the best for her.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.611
And this is why she was taken.

32:39.624 --> 32:42.718
- Shen, tell me what to do.
- Don't take the kidnapper's calls.

32:45.730 --> 32:47.220
Do you want your daughter back?

32:47.999 --> 32:49.728
- Of course.
- Then do what I say.

32:50.068 --> 32:52.059
But what if that provokes him?

32:52.136 --> 32:54.764
Aren't you always supposed to
play to their demands?

32:54.839 --> 32:56.898
The longer you delay talking to him...

32:57.575 --> 32:58.439
the longer she lives.

32:58.509 --> 32:59.498
Shen...

33:07.485 --> 33:09.578
[in English]
Straight up, how bad is this place?

33:09.654 --> 33:11.178
It's bad.

33:11.289 --> 33:13.280
This place is a maze, Ray.

33:13.358 --> 33:16.259
It's a hellhole like I've never seen.

33:16.327 --> 33:19.421
Look, you got me this far, man.
This is not your fight.

33:19.497 --> 33:20.828
If you wanna pull out, I get it.

33:20.932 --> 33:24.629
No, I got your back, man.
I'm here for you. Let's do it.

33:46.524 --> 33:50.187
[Shouting, faint]

33:50.294 --> 33:54.287
[Shouting, moaning]

33:58.736 --> 33:59.862
Wong.

34:04.809 --> 34:05.798
[In Chinese] Yeah?

34:08.312 --> 34:09.301
I'm sorry.

34:10.715 --> 34:13.309
It's not your fault. Stay positive.

34:14.352 --> 34:15.649
Wong.

34:16.754 --> 34:17.982
Yeah?

34:19.390 --> 34:21.585
We'll get out of this together.

34:26.831 --> 34:27.923
We will.

34:29.267 --> 34:31.599
[Repeats Chinese phrase]

34:43.014 --> 34:45.005
[In English]
What the fuck you looking at, chopsticks?

34:47.185 --> 34:49.585
[Man] Back up, Sonny. Open 'em up.

35:12.243 --> 35:13.904
Come on.

35:13.978 --> 35:15.377
Come on.

35:22.487 --> 35:23.419
Out of the hostages,

35:23.488 --> 35:26.150
who has the highest security clearance
in your father's company?

35:26.257 --> 35:29.158
I know you're all geniuses, and I know
you're all the best and the brightest.

35:29.260 --> 35:32.093
But who does he trust
with sensitive matters?

35:32.163 --> 35:33.221
I don't know.

35:33.297 --> 35:35.822
Trade fucking secrets.
Who has the clearance?

35:38.769 --> 35:40.293
Come here.

35:48.679 --> 35:49.941
Is it this guy?

35:50.948 --> 35:51.937
Huh?

35:53.351 --> 35:54.978
Look. Look, look.

35:55.086 --> 35:57.486
No? Come here. Come here.

36:03.361 --> 36:05.352
- What about this guy?
- [Fingers snap]

36:05.997 --> 36:07.658
Look at him.

36:13.337 --> 36:14.326
Look at him.

36:15.973 --> 36:17.964
Does he have the clearance?

36:21.279 --> 36:23.110
Tell me, or I'll shoot him
in the fucking head.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.170
[Wong] l-lt's me.

36:24.815 --> 36:26.840
Stop. I do.

36:29.687 --> 36:30.984
[In Chinese] No. Don't do it.

36:31.055 --> 36:33.853
Once he has the information,
he'll kill us.

36:35.493 --> 36:37.154
- [Speaking foreign language]
- [Crackling]

36:39.864 --> 36:41.627
- [Gunshot]
- [Gasps]

36:47.171 --> 36:48.729
[Daya whimpering]

36:49.740 --> 36:51.901
[In English] Wait! No!

36:55.646 --> 36:57.045
Lock her up.

36:57.748 --> 36:59.739
[Gasping]

37:01.352 --> 37:02.979
[Lock clicking]

37:30.615 --> 37:34.051
You're gonna give me access to
Zhang's restricted developments.

37:39.724 --> 37:42.420
Uh... [clears throat]
Let's try this a different way.

37:43.794 --> 37:45.921
I want you to teach me
how to speak Chinese.

37:47.098 --> 37:48.725
You're gonna teach me how to say,

37:48.799 --> 37:51.359
"Tell me,
or I will shoot you in the face."

37:51.435 --> 37:52.902
But in Chinese.

37:53.537 --> 37:55.198
What?

37:55.273 --> 37:57.036
Teach me how to say,

37:57.108 --> 38:00.373
"Tell me, or I will shoot you
in the face," in Chinese.

38:10.721 --> 38:12.211
There...

38:12.290 --> 38:15.225
There is a five-year projection plan.

38:18.829 --> 38:21.730
I want everything.
What do you need, a laptop?

38:21.799 --> 38:24.393
- L...
- Don't say "can't."

38:24.468 --> 38:26.436
Those are last words.

38:29.507 --> 38:31.498
I'll get him a laptop.

38:33.177 --> 38:36.169
[Gate opens, closes]

38:47.024 --> 38:49.458
Hush, what have you got?

38:49.527 --> 38:50.824
Deploying drone now.

38:58.703 --> 39:00.864
[Shen] Where do you think
they're holding the hostages?

39:00.971 --> 39:04.498
The guy definitely called from
the prison chapel, which is right there.

39:05.776 --> 39:08.540
You got the east block,
west block, administration.

39:08.646 --> 39:12.309
- How big is this place?
- Over 200,000 square feet.

39:13.551 --> 39:15.849
What kind of shells are those?

39:17.121 --> 39:20.147
Dragon's breath.
You know what that is?

39:20.224 --> 39:23.125
Yeah. Planning on burning
this place to the ground?

39:23.194 --> 39:25.890
- Yeah, if we're lucky.
- [Chuckles]

39:26.697 --> 39:28.289
[Hush] Listen up, guys.

39:28.366 --> 39:29.958
Uplinking drone feed now.

39:30.034 --> 39:31.626
Thanks, Hush.

39:38.542 --> 39:40.737
Okay, we've got two cell blocks.

39:40.845 --> 39:44.679
Uh, the thermal drone
is showing... 30...

39:44.749 --> 39:46.979
No, 40.
Forty bodies in the west block.

39:47.051 --> 39:50.145
- 40 what, prisoners?
- It looks like it. They're spaced evenly.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.712
Jesus Christ, he's running a black site.

39:52.823 --> 39:54.814
[Ray] All right. What else, guards?

39:54.892 --> 39:57.190
Guard tower. Looks like three people.

39:57.261 --> 39:59.821
Weak spots. What's our way in?
Come on, Jules.

39:59.897 --> 40:01.489
There's two heat spots on the roof.

40:01.565 --> 40:04.193
One is covered, one might be accessible.

40:04.268 --> 40:06.168
- I can get up there.
- I don't doubt that.

40:06.237 --> 40:07.602
What are we waiting for?

40:07.705 --> 40:09.764
- We don't run in blind, kid.
- We're wasting time.

40:09.874 --> 40:11.364
- Daya is my responsibility.
- Hey!

40:12.943 --> 40:15.343
I got someone in there too.

40:23.888 --> 40:26.516
Never seen anyone go to a fight
in a sports car before.

40:26.590 --> 40:30.526
- [Ray] Hey, where you going?
- You know me. I work better alone.

40:31.962 --> 40:33.361
- I may be late...
- [gun cocks]

40:33.431 --> 40:35.729
...but I'll make a big impression.

40:35.800 --> 40:38.098
- Good luck.
- [Door closes]

40:54.819 --> 40:56.309
Les.

41:01.225 --> 41:03.318
Les, what are you doing?

41:07.498 --> 41:09.227
What are you doing?

41:14.171 --> 41:16.765
You gotta stay the course, man.

41:16.841 --> 41:21.005
Look, I know you want revenge,
but we gotta get that money.

41:22.079 --> 41:23.137
You knew my father.

41:23.247 --> 41:25.442
- He was good to me.
- Yeah.

41:25.516 --> 41:28.610
But he's all gone.
You're still here.

41:28.686 --> 41:30.916
Let's get the money and live right.

41:30.988 --> 41:34.151
- Fuck this shit with that bitch.
- Hey.

41:34.258 --> 41:35.486
- Hey.
- Okay.

41:35.593 --> 41:36.958
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

41:37.027 --> 41:39.655
- Well, she's a distraction.
- Uh-huh.

41:39.763 --> 41:43.096
I say we kill her and be done with it.

41:46.604 --> 41:49.095
Do me a favor, Frankie.

41:49.173 --> 41:51.198
Just keep doing what I say, okay?

41:51.308 --> 41:52.775
[Sighs]

41:53.944 --> 41:55.138
Les.

41:56.947 --> 41:58.039
We gotta kill her.

41:58.616 --> 42:00.345
Do what I say!

42:13.564 --> 42:14.792
[Ray whispers] Okay.

42:16.834 --> 42:19.132
What's with you and Les's father?

42:21.639 --> 42:24.005
You were his partner,
and he sold you out.

42:24.074 --> 42:25.166
Why?

42:30.581 --> 42:31.878
Five million.

42:34.652 --> 42:37.143
And Daya's father's connected to this too?

42:44.228 --> 42:46.093
Lot of fathers here.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.991
[Jules] Hey, Ray, look at this.

42:52.069 --> 42:53.263
What do you got?

42:53.370 --> 42:56.533
It looks like there might be
a weak spot in the bathroom.

42:57.408 --> 42:59.035
Bathroom.

42:59.109 --> 43:00.838
The sewer system.

43:00.911 --> 43:02.606
- Jules, come on.
- I'm on it.

43:08.786 --> 43:10.048
I got tunnels.

43:10.120 --> 43:11.712
Tunnels.

43:21.365 --> 43:22.354
[Sighs]

43:26.470 --> 43:27.596
You have time.

43:36.113 --> 43:39.605
The sins of the father
are not the sins of the son.

43:45.623 --> 43:49.081
[Beeping]

43:56.133 --> 43:57.600
We have visitors.

43:57.668 --> 44:00.967
- We got visitors.
- [Frankie chuckles] Oh, yeah.

44:01.572 --> 44:02.800
We got visitors!

44:19.490 --> 44:21.014

44:23.627 --> 44:26.118
- [Ray on radio] Status.
- Standing by.

44:28.265 --> 44:29.459
See anybody?

44:30.467 --> 44:31.434
Nothing yet.

44:31.502 --> 44:33.094
That can't be.

44:33.170 --> 44:36.105
- That's all.
- Check the guard towers?

44:38.275 --> 44:40.038
Yeah. No signs of life.

44:40.878 --> 44:42.277
Something's wrong.

44:43.147 --> 44:44.671
This is very wrong.

44:44.782 --> 44:47.649
- Stay sharp, guys. Stay alert.
- You too.

44:52.456 --> 44:54.447
What the fuck.
He knows we're coming.

44:55.159 --> 44:57.127
He knows we're coming.

45:52.116 --> 45:54.380
You familiar with the legend of Nian?

45:59.289 --> 46:00.187
[In Chinese] Honeypot.

46:01.725 --> 46:03.454
He's using Daya as bait.

46:06.964 --> 46:08.955
What did you have with her?

46:10.033 --> 46:11.261
Were you together?

46:16.039 --> 46:18.064
We hold.

46:18.575 --> 46:20.099
This is a joint operation.

46:20.210 --> 46:21.268
We don't engage.

46:30.120 --> 46:31.712
[In English] Shit.

46:32.756 --> 46:34.986
It's...
It's a Chinese legend.

46:35.926 --> 46:38.451
Yeah. I wanna hear it.

46:38.562 --> 46:40.792
Tell it to me.

46:42.666 --> 46:43.758
Um...

46:45.269 --> 46:49.069
in ancient times,
there was a monster called Nian.

46:50.007 --> 46:51.941
Every spring, Nian would come out

46:52.009 --> 46:54.000
and eat the villagers and livestock.

46:55.112 --> 46:57.444
And then one day, they discovered that...

46:57.514 --> 46:59.505
burning bamboo scared the monster off.

47:01.118 --> 47:04.747
[Chuckles]
Made a crackling sound, didn't it?

47:06.023 --> 47:07.320
Yes.

47:08.525 --> 47:11.517
They invented firecrackers
to re-create that sound.

47:19.036 --> 47:20.970
I'm gonna leave you out here...

47:21.972 --> 47:23.872
fight the monster inside.

47:24.975 --> 47:28.308
Pow, pow, pow.

47:29.379 --> 47:30.539
Hey!

47:31.782 --> 47:34.876
[In Chinese] Don't do that again.
We work together for Daya.

47:35.285 --> 47:38.448
- Then what are we waiting for?
- We wait for Breslin.

47:42.459 --> 47:44.017
[In English] I don't work for Breslin.

47:45.529 --> 47:48.987
Showtime, everybody. Let's go!
You know what to do. Go now.

48:18.896 --> 48:20.659

49:18.889 --> 49:19.878
Zip him up.

49:24.428 --> 49:26.453
[Chuckling] Let's go.

49:49.486 --> 49:50.475
Okay.

49:53.190 --> 49:56.250
Thank you, Mr. Bodyguard.
You did exactly what I thought you'd do.

49:56.326 --> 49:59.693
You led me to Ray Breslin,
helped me capture his girl.

50:12.442 --> 50:17.345
Now, you two, you both have
wasted your time and your lives.

50:19.616 --> 50:22.551
[Lester] Ah. Look who's here.

50:22.652 --> 50:24.882
[Gasping]

50:37.000 --> 50:39.730
Gentlemen, you have two choices.
You can either...

50:45.075 --> 50:46.702
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

50:48.678 --> 50:50.373
Why are you staring at him?

50:50.480 --> 50:51.845
- I wasn't.
- Yeah, you were.

50:51.915 --> 50:53.405
- No.
- You were staring right at him.

50:53.517 --> 50:55.917
[Daya] Mm-mmm.

50:56.920 --> 50:58.911
You two know each other, don't you?

50:59.022 --> 51:02.082
Something's going on here.
I can sense it. I sense something.

51:08.265 --> 51:10.699
Why do you look at me like that?

51:10.767 --> 51:13.531
You gotta see this through my eyes.

51:13.603 --> 51:17.869
My father died boiling
at the bottom of a ship.

51:17.941 --> 51:20.409
I'd have had more respect
if you sat him down in a chair,

51:20.510 --> 51:24.002
explained what he did wrong,
and then you put a bullet in his head.

51:25.115 --> 51:26.844
I'm sorry.

51:28.452 --> 51:29.749
You hear that, Ray?

51:37.127 --> 51:38.754
Am I coming in loud and clear?

51:38.862 --> 51:39.851
Abby.

51:39.930 --> 51:41.921
You're missing all the fun here, Ray.

51:43.133 --> 51:45.465
Keep listening, buddy.
This is all for you.

51:48.939 --> 51:52.136
[Lester] He got in the tunnels.
Leave Breslin's girl with me.

51:52.242 --> 51:55.643

1:11:37.459 --> 1:11:40.087
You wanted me, you got me.
Come on.

1:11:43.999 --> 1:11:45.796
You call that a fuckin' hit?

1:11:45.901 --> 1:11:47.334
- You fuckin' pussy.
- Wait, wait.

1:11:47.436 --> 1:11:50.166
I'll fuckin' kill you.
Let me tell you about my father.

1:11:50.272 --> 1:11:52.172
Let me tell you about
my fuckin' father.

1:11:52.274 --> 1:11:53.969
- [Groans]
- Get up.

1:11:54.843 --> 1:11:55.832
Get up.

1:11:58.347 --> 1:12:01.282
That's right.
Let me tell you about my father.

1:12:01.350 --> 1:12:02.339
Really?

1:12:05.187 --> 1:12:08.816
He was the meanest
son of a bitch in the world.

1:12:12.027 --> 1:12:15.292
Know what he said?
Know what he said?

1:12:16.832 --> 1:12:20.268
You know what he said? He said,
"You should learn to forgive, son.

1:12:20.336 --> 1:12:22.964
You shouldn't be so mean."

1:12:23.038 --> 1:12:24.767
I said, "You know, it's too late.

1:12:26.108 --> 1:12:27.598
You made me what I am."

1:12:32.715 --> 1:12:35.343
[Groaning, gasping]

1:12:36.885 --> 1:12:40.719
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Shh.

1:12:40.823 --> 1:12:43.155
Don't say anything. Shh.

1:12:44.193 --> 1:12:45.660
Don't say anything.

1:12:49.998 --> 1:12:51.522
- Wait, wait.
- Shh.

1:12:52.668 --> 1:12:54.329
- [Gasping]
- This is what it...

1:12:54.403 --> 1:12:56.530
This is what it felt like.

1:13:45.053 --> 1:13:47.578
Please accept my sympathy for your loss.

1:14:22.791 --> 1:14:24.918
[Chattering, faint]

1:15:43.205 --> 1:15:44.035
[In Chinese] No.

1:15:47.843 --> 1:15:49.367
Remember Shen?

1:15:58.921 --> 1:16:00.582
He will be taking me home.

1:16:14.069 --> 1:16:16.037
You don't mind, do you?

1:16:16.605 --> 1:16:20.541
Well, I had other plans,
but for you I'll break them.

1:16:48.170 --> 1:16:50.866
I'll take care of Abigail's
arrival arrangements.

1:16:54.743 --> 1:16:56.711
Appreciate it.

1:17:04.119 --> 1:17:05.586
Hey.

1:17:06.989 --> 1:17:09.457
- There's something you gotta do.
- What?

1:17:09.558 --> 1:17:12.083
You gotta forgive yourself.
Wasn't your fault.

1:17:13.161 --> 1:17:15.322
Not gonna be so easy to do.

1:17:17.499 --> 1:17:19.057
I'm done with prisons.

1:17:19.134 --> 1:17:21.659
- No more prisons?
- No more.

1:17:21.770 --> 1:17:24.671
That's music to me. Any ideas?

1:17:24.773 --> 1:17:27.241
Anything outside sounds good.

1:17:27.309 --> 1:17:29.470
Outside is good for your health.

1:17:29.578 --> 1:17:31.978
Let's talk about this.

1:17:32.080 --> 1:17:33.240
You got any ideas?

1:17:33.315 --> 1:17:35.442
What do you think about South America?

1:17:35.517 --> 1:17:36.609
It's kinda far away.

1:17:36.685 --> 1:17:40.746
Before you say no, remember, you owe me.

1:17:40.822 --> 1:17:44.622
I know this guy down there. [chuckles]
He's a little shady, but I'm telling you...

1:17:44.693 --> 1:17:47.491
A little?
Everyone we know is shady.

1:17:48.630 --> 1:17:51.030
