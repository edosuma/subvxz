WEBVTT

00:01.368 --> 00:02.001
I'm home!

00:02.003 --> 00:05.270
Adult adam: <i> My dad was</i>
<i>the least complicated guy</i>
<i>on the planet.</i>

00:05.272 --> 00:07.039
<i>His first order</i>
<i>of business</i>

00:07.041 --> 00:08.807
<i>Was to always</i>
<i>be comfortable.</i>

00:08.809 --> 00:11.910
<i>That meant parking his pants</i>
<i>at the door.</i>

00:11.912 --> 00:15.180
<i>His hobbies included</i>
<i>sleeping in his chair...</i>

00:15.182 --> 00:16.615
(snoring)

00:16.617 --> 00:17.950
<i>...Watching</i> fantasy island.

00:17.952 --> 00:18.884
<i>Oh, don't worry, boss.</i>

00:18.886 --> 00:20.185
Adult adam:
<i>Sleeping in his chair...</i>

00:20.187 --> 00:21.420
Oh!
<i>...Yelling at the phillies...</i>

00:21.422 --> 00:22.788
(shouting)
what is that pitch?

00:22.790 --> 00:24.890
<i>...And sleeping in his chair.</i>
(snorts)

00:24.892 --> 00:27.426
<i>Even his parenting style</i>
<i>was simple</i>

00:27.428 --> 00:29.895
<i>And always involved</i>
<i>choice vocab words.</i>

00:29.897 --> 00:32.564
Hey, you morons.
Stop being morons.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.066
Unreal.
I raised a moron.

00:34.068 --> 00:35.501
Why you got to be a moron
all the time?

00:35.503 --> 00:37.136
<i>He wasn't</i>
<i>a complicated guy</i>

00:37.138 --> 00:38.337
<i>Or, frankly,</i>
<i>even that interesting.</i>

00:38.339 --> 00:39.671
<i>But every once in a while,</i>

00:39.673 --> 00:41.273
<i>He was accidentally reveal</i>

00:41.275 --> 00:41.974
<i>Something about himself</i>

00:41.976 --> 00:44.743
<i>That would make you feel</i>
<i>like you didn't know him</i>
<i>at all.</i>

00:44.745 --> 00:46.712
All right, all fixed.
Wow!

00:46.714 --> 00:48.480
Where did you learn
how to do that?

00:48.482 --> 00:50.349
Army.

00:50.351 --> 00:51.350
What?

00:51.352 --> 00:52.751
Did you say "army"?

00:52.753 --> 00:55.587
Dad, is this you
and lou reed?

00:55.589 --> 00:57.923
Yeah, we, uh,
waited tables together.

00:57.925 --> 00:59.491
What? Tell me more.

00:59.493 --> 01:01.994
Eh, it was
a whole thing.

01:01.996 --> 01:05.731
Wait! Come back!
I want to know you!

01:05.733 --> 01:08.333
(video game beeping)

01:08.335 --> 01:11.070
Pull up! Pull up!
You're gonna crash
the plane.

01:11.072 --> 01:13.505
I was in a plane crash once.

01:14.941 --> 01:15.808
Nap time.

01:15.810 --> 01:19.344
Adult adam:
<i>Yep, some people</i>
<i>glorify the past,</i>

01:19.346 --> 01:20.245
<i>But not my dad.</i>

01:20.247 --> 01:22.414
<i>To him, it's like</i>
<i>it never even happened.</i>

01:22.416 --> 01:24.316
Oh, my god, murray,
you're not gonna
believe it.

01:24.318 --> 01:26.518
I just got off the phone
with your old high school.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.487
Your record
has been broken.

01:28.489 --> 01:31.523
Whoa, wait.
Dad had a record
in high school?

01:31.525 --> 01:32.791
What kind of record?

01:32.793 --> 01:33.692
Chili! He loves chili.

01:33.694 --> 01:35.594
It's something to do
with chili.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.096
True, but that's not it.

01:37.098 --> 01:38.197
Your dad set the record

01:38.199 --> 01:40.599
For most free throws
in a row

01:40.601 --> 01:42.067
At central high.

01:42.069 --> 01:43.435
Like, in basketball?

01:43.437 --> 01:44.803
What... What are you
talking about?

01:44.805 --> 01:46.238
What can I say?
We won state.

01:46.240 --> 01:49.475
Uh, I hit 79 free throws
in a row.

01:49.477 --> 01:50.976
Uh, what do you
want from me?

01:50.978 --> 01:52.878
Murray, the high school
wants you to go back

01:52.880 --> 01:55.848
So they can honor you
at the game Saturday night.

01:55.850 --> 01:58.050
We get to stay downtown,

01:58.052 --> 02:01.220
And there's gonna be
a banquet.

02:01.222 --> 02:01.820
A banquet?

02:01.822 --> 02:04.289
That's the fanciest
of all food parties!

02:04.291 --> 02:06.325
I know!
It's a very big deal.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.227
Here's the thing
about that.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.094
Pass.

02:09.096 --> 02:09.928
No pass.
Pass!

02:09.930 --> 02:11.964
I already told them
you'd be there.
Why would you do that?

02:11.966 --> 02:14.099
You know I don't have
an interest in things.

02:14.101 --> 02:14.800
Is this for real?

02:14.802 --> 02:17.536
I mean, we've never even
seen you touch a basketball.

02:17.538 --> 02:19.238
Yeah, I mean,
I can't believe this.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.540
It's one of my dreams
to play in the nba,

02:21.542 --> 02:23.308
And you never
once mentioned it?

02:23.310 --> 02:25.110
Didn't see
how it was relevant.

02:25.112 --> 02:26.945
Oh, it's relevant.

02:26.947 --> 02:28.780
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do?

02:28.782 --> 02:32.751
Huh? Huh?
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do?

02:32.753 --> 02:34.419
Not much more
than what I'm doing
right now.

02:34.421 --> 02:37.389
I want you to show me
what you got,
free-throw king!

02:37.391 --> 02:38.290
Are we, uh,
done here yet?

02:38.292 --> 02:42.227
No! You were clearly
some type of popular
high school god.

02:42.229 --> 02:43.128
Tell me
what it was like.

02:43.130 --> 02:46.798
I don't know.
I, uh, dated a lot of girls.

02:46.800 --> 02:47.432
I went to parties.

02:47.434 --> 02:49.801
I got elected
class president
a few times.

02:49.803 --> 02:51.970
Lunch lady gave me
free jell-o.

02:51.972 --> 02:52.538
Eh, the usual.

02:52.540 --> 02:55.874
Not usual.
That's the opposite
of my life.

02:55.876 --> 02:56.475
The lunch lady said

02:56.477 --> 02:58.844
I look like the warlord
who burnt down her village.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.812
I'm going in.
No, wait, wait! Come on!

03:00.814 --> 03:02.047
I thought you were gonna
give me some pointers.

03:02.049 --> 03:04.483
Unless you want me
to give you some.

03:04.485 --> 03:08.153
How about
from way downtown?

03:08.155 --> 03:09.454
Hope you brought
an umbrella,

03:09.456 --> 03:12.925
'cause it's about to
rain some 3s!

03:13.193 --> 03:14.927
Swish, baby!

03:14.929 --> 03:15.994
Fundamentals!

03:15.996 --> 03:18.096
Intangibles!

03:18.098 --> 03:19.765
Unselfish!

03:19.767 --> 03:21.600
Basketball!

03:21.602 --> 03:24.236
And that's
how you do it.

03:24.238 --> 03:25.537
<i>♪ I'm twisted up inside</i>

03:25.539 --> 03:30.842
<i>♪ but nonetheless</i>
<i>I feel the need to say</i>

03:31.744 --> 03:32.844
<i>♪ I don't know the future</i>

03:32.846 --> 03:37.482
<i>♪ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i>clearer every day ♪</i>

03:37.484 --> 03:38.550
'sup, lexy bloom?

03:38.552 --> 03:41.920
Ready to break the seal
on this new yearbook,
or what?

03:41.922 --> 03:42.554
Uh, sure.

03:42.556 --> 03:45.157
Adult adam:
<i>This year, barry left</i>
<i>an entire page blank</i>

03:45.159 --> 03:47.593
<i>For the one signature</i>
<i>he cared about...</i>

03:47.595 --> 03:50.062
<i>His dream girl, lexy bloom.</i>

03:50.064 --> 03:53.298
"have a bitchin' summer,
gustav?"

03:53.300 --> 03:55.033
I'm not the swedish
exchange student!

03:55.035 --> 03:57.669
I'm speaking english
to you!

04:00.707 --> 04:01.673
Swing and a miss.

04:01.675 --> 04:04.176
Aw, you love her,
and she thinks
you're from sweden.

04:04.178 --> 04:06.111
I've spent all year
trying to make
a name for myself,

04:06.113 --> 04:09.214
And lexy bloom
still doesn't know
who I am.

04:09.216 --> 04:09.881
She's so lucky.

04:09.883 --> 04:14.052
If only there was a way to,
like, have a casual
get-together

04:14.054 --> 04:16.688
With the coolest kids
from school,

04:16.690 --> 04:17.656
Like, at our house,

04:17.658 --> 04:19.424
But without the formal,
sit-down dinner.

04:19.426 --> 04:20.592
I think
you're describing a party.

04:20.594 --> 04:23.528
Oh, my god.
I have the greatest idea.

04:23.530 --> 04:25.230
I'm gonna throw a party.

04:25.232 --> 04:27.699
Mom and dad
are staying downtown
Saturday night.

04:27.701 --> 04:28.934
(gasps)
I'll invite the whole school!

04:28.936 --> 04:31.737
Whoa, hold on.
Uh, I want you
to think about this...

04:31.739 --> 04:33.705
High-school friends!

04:33.707 --> 04:34.740
This Saturday night,

04:34.742 --> 04:36.341
I'm inviting you
to the best party

04:36.343 --> 04:39.344
In the history
of william penn academy,

04:39.346 --> 04:40.779
Thrown by yours truly!

04:40.781 --> 04:42.414
Boy: We love you, gustav!

04:42.416 --> 04:45.183
No! I'm barry goldberg!

04:45.185 --> 04:46.218
Doesn't matter!

04:46.220 --> 04:48.520
Party at my place!

04:48.522 --> 04:49.621
Adult adam:
<i>For the next few days,</i>

04:49.623 --> 04:52.391
<i>Barry spread the word</i>
<i>all over school.</i>

04:52.393 --> 04:53.558
<i>It was gonna be</i>
<i>a wild rager,</i>

04:53.560 --> 04:55.927
<i>And nobody</i>
<i>was more excited</i>
<i>than me.</i>

04:55.929 --> 04:58.597
Oh, man.
My first high-school party

04:58.599 --> 05:02.401
With r-rated language
and adult situations.

05:02.403 --> 05:05.337
This is my "risky business."

05:05.339 --> 05:05.937
Damn right!

05:05.939 --> 05:08.974
There's gonna be dancing,
fistfights,

05:08.976 --> 05:10.242
Pizzas on record players,

05:10.244 --> 05:13.378
Hot cheerleaders
jumping from the roof
into the pool.

05:13.380 --> 05:15.380
We don't have a pool.

05:15.715 --> 05:17.449
Don't we?

05:17.451 --> 05:18.617
Blow this up.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.185
(gasps) sweet!

05:20.187 --> 05:23.322
I'm gonna go
grab my inhaler
and get started.

05:23.324 --> 05:23.822
Okay!

05:23.824 --> 05:25.324
I got twister
and ashtrays.

05:25.326 --> 05:27.259
What time's
this party kicking off?

05:27.261 --> 05:28.293
Whoa, wait.
You're okay with this?

05:28.295 --> 05:31.563
Uh, look,
I... I don't condone
lying to your parents,

05:31.565 --> 05:34.966
But I've been tracking
your highs and lows
this year.

05:34.968 --> 05:36.968
And frankly,
you need this.

05:36.970 --> 05:37.803
Awesome!

05:37.805 --> 05:39.404
Only thing left
is to make sure

05:39.406 --> 05:42.207
Mom and dad leave
without suspecting a thing.

05:42.209 --> 05:43.075
Okay, love bugs.

05:43.077 --> 05:46.078
Pops is in charge
while we're away
for the evening.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.112
Have fun.

05:47.114 --> 05:47.779
No fun here.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.214
We're just gonna sit here
bored to death

05:49.216 --> 05:50.315
Waiting for you
to come home.

05:50.317 --> 05:53.985
Oh, well, in that case,
throw on some shoes
and join us! I insist.

05:53.987 --> 05:55.387
Then it's settled.
We're coming.

05:55.389 --> 05:57.322
What are you doing?
Panicking.

05:57.324 --> 06:00.692
Okay, if the kids
come with us,
I'm staying home.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.227
Great! Stay.

06:02.229 --> 06:03.228
What's wrong with you?

06:03.230 --> 06:04.363
The more the merrier.

06:04.365 --> 06:05.497
You're a stupid,
stupid boy.

06:05.499 --> 06:08.900
You... You two just go.
I'll hold down the fort.

06:08.902 --> 06:11.536
All right.
Dinner's in the fridge.

06:11.538 --> 06:14.206
(sighs)
that was a close one.

06:14.208 --> 06:16.708
We make a good team,
guys.

06:17.176 --> 06:18.377
Dover: (on mic)
<i>ladies and gentlemen...</i>

06:18.379 --> 06:20.545
Adult adam:
<i>While barry couldn't wait</i>
<i>to start his epic night,</i>

06:20.547 --> 06:21.780
<i>My dad was still indifferent</i>
<i>about his.</i>

06:21.782 --> 06:24.816
Dover: <i> ...Captain of the 1961</i>
<i>state championship team</i>
<i>murray goldberg!</i>

06:24.818 --> 06:25.951
(whistle blows)

06:25.953 --> 06:26.685
(all cheering)

06:26.687 --> 06:28.620
Adult adam:
<i>...Until this happened.</i>

06:28.622 --> 06:30.222
What the hell's
going on?

06:30.224 --> 06:31.590
What's wrong
with these people?

06:31.592 --> 06:34.192
Nothing.
They love you, murray.

06:34.194 --> 06:34.693
(chuckles)

06:34.695 --> 06:37.262
Adult adam:
<i>For my dad,</i>
<i>the past was the past.</i>

06:37.264 --> 06:37.996
<i>He never wanted to be</i>

06:37.998 --> 06:40.031
<i>One of those guys</i>
<i>always recounting</i>
<i>his glory days.</i>

06:40.033 --> 06:42.968
<i>But for one shining moment,</i>
<i>he decided to embrace it.</i>

06:42.970 --> 06:46.204
All: (chanting)
chomp, chomp, chomp!
Let's go, beavers! Let's go!

06:46.206 --> 06:47.973
Chomp, chomp, chomp!
(whistle blows)

06:47.975 --> 06:49.775
Adult adam:
<i>My dad hadn't picked up</i>
<i>a basketball in years.</i>

06:49.777 --> 06:51.576
<i>But by the end</i>
<i>of the first half,</i>

06:51.578 --> 06:53.211
<i>He was ready to suit up.</i>

06:53.213 --> 06:55.580
Oh! (laughs)

06:55.582 --> 06:57.249
That's how we do it,
beavers!

06:57.251 --> 06:58.784
Dover: <i> Okay!</i>
Yeah!

06:58.786 --> 06:59.918
<i>Just want to take</i>
<i>a quick moment</i>

06:59.920 --> 07:02.187
<i>To welcome back</i>

07:02.189 --> 07:04.689
<i>In honor of his</i>

<i>We'd like to present him</i>

<i>With a ball</i>

07:11.432 --> 07:12.397
Whoo!

07:12.399 --> 07:14.833
Hey, hot stuff!

07:17.970 --> 07:18.870
Thank you.

07:18.872 --> 07:19.838
Thank you very much.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.908
All: (chanting)

Shoot the ball!

07:22.910 --> 07:25.744
Shoot the ball!
Shoot the ball!

07:25.746 --> 07:26.945
Shoot the ball!
Shoot the ball!

07:26.947 --> 07:28.447
Really?
What are you doing?

07:28.449 --> 07:31.116
Shoot the ball!
Shoot the ball!
(chuckles)

07:31.118 --> 07:33.051
Shoot the ball!
Shoot the ball!

07:33.053 --> 07:36.154
Shoot the ball!
Shoot the ball!
That's my husband!

Adult adam:
<i>The moment my dad</i>
<i>stepped to that line,</i>

07:38.125 --> 07:42.727
<i>He realized he was still</i>
<i>that kid from high school...</i>

07:42.729 --> 07:46.832
<i>An athlete, a legend,</i>
<i>a champion.</i>

07:46.834 --> 07:48.867
<i>And then, he did this.</i>

07:59.111 --> 08:00.912
(camera shutter clicks)
got it!

08:00.914 --> 08:02.814
Boy: You suck, old man!

08:02.816 --> 08:03.815
(all laughing)

08:03.817 --> 08:05.817
All: (chanting) air ball!

08:05.819 --> 08:06.818
Adult adam:
<i>In his defense,</i>

08:06.820 --> 08:08.320
<i>That was a very common</i>
<i>shooting style</i>

08:08.322 --> 08:09.020
<i>Back in the day.</i>

08:09.022 --> 08:12.090
<i>But as the chant</i>
<i>of "air ball"</i>
<i>rang through the gym,</i>

08:12.092 --> 08:13.258
<i>It only confirmed to my dad</i>

08:13.260 --> 08:14.926
<i>That he didn't belong</i>
<i>on that court.</i>

08:14.928 --> 08:16.895
<i>He belonged</i>
<i>in front of the tv</i>

08:16.897 --> 08:17.829
<i>In his underpants.</i>

08:17.831 --> 08:21.099
<i>But this wasn't</i>
<i>the most embarrassing display</i>
<i>of the evening.</i>

08:21.101 --> 08:24.469
<i>That belonged</i>
<i>to my brother's epic party.</i>

08:24.471 --> 08:25.103
<i>It was 9:00,</i>

08:25.105 --> 08:27.639
<i>And the only people</i>
<i>that showed up were me,</i>

08:27.641 --> 08:30.675
<i>Roger mcfadden,</i>
<i>who brought bugles,</i>

08:30.677 --> 08:34.212
<i>And gustav,</i>
<i>the foreign-exchange student.</i>

08:34.214 --> 08:35.080
Later. I'm going out.

08:35.082 --> 08:36.915
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

08:36.917 --> 08:39.217
Look... Look what's
happening in there.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.219
It's a pure
sausage fest.

08:41.221 --> 08:43.121
The bugles are
for hot chicks only!

08:43.123 --> 08:47.125
You're a popular girl.
Invite some of
your friends over.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.127
The poor guy needs this.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.462
Barry: (shouts)
shut up, gustav!

08:50.464 --> 08:53.031
It's called
being fashionably late.

08:53.033 --> 08:56.401
Fine. I'll call
a couple of my friends.

08:56.403 --> 08:57.168
Thank you.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.069
(indistinct conversations)

08:58.071 --> 08:59.638
Adult adam:
<i>Nowadays, all it would</i>
<i>take is a tweet.</i>

08:59.640 --> 09:01.406
<i>But back then,</i>
<i>one phone call</i>
<i>worked just as well.</i>

09:01.408 --> 09:03.475
I thought you said
"a couple of friends."

09:03.477 --> 09:05.143
All I did
was call lainey.

09:05.145 --> 09:07.078
You wanted barry
to have fun, right?

09:07.080 --> 09:10.048
Look at the guy.
He is the man.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.684
Welcome to <i> casa de</i> barry,
ladies!

09:12.686 --> 09:16.888
Looking good.
Nice pants, random dude.

09:16.890 --> 09:17.622
Told you I'd rock.

09:17.624 --> 09:20.191
Is the party
like a rap video,
or what?

09:20.193 --> 09:21.326
Move over,
aunt rose's 50th,

09:21.328 --> 09:25.430
This is the hottest party
this dining room's
ever seen.

09:30.002 --> 09:32.304
Holy crap.
It's lexy bloom.

09:32.306 --> 09:33.405
She came!

09:33.407 --> 09:34.139
She's here!

09:34.141 --> 09:35.907
What are you waiting for,
man?

09:35.909 --> 09:37.609
Chiclet me.

09:39.612 --> 09:40.145
Whoa, girl.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.347
I see you found
the vip section.

09:42.349 --> 09:44.316
What makes this
the vip section?

09:44.318 --> 09:45.050
'cause I'm here.

09:45.052 --> 09:47.586
Anything you want,
I'll make it happen.

09:47.588 --> 09:50.822
Fruit roll-ups?
Bagel bites?

09:50.824 --> 09:51.957
Flintstone vitamins?

09:51.959 --> 09:54.192
The world's
your oyster, baby.

09:54.194 --> 09:54.626
See?

09:54.628 --> 09:56.261
We just gave
your weird little brother

09:56.263 --> 09:58.663
The best night
of his life.

09:58.665 --> 10:02.334
Whoo!
The party has arrived!

10:02.336 --> 10:04.869
You go to school
with him?

10:04.871 --> 10:06.504
I do not.

10:06.506 --> 10:07.639
And we're out of hand.

10:07.641 --> 10:10.308
Who wants
to take a shower?

10:12.511 --> 10:15.447
Adult adam:
<i>By 10:00, barry's party</i>
<i>was blowing up...</i>

10:15.449 --> 10:17.248
<i>But not as much</i>
<i>as my sister.</i>

10:17.250 --> 10:21.386
Hey! Stop!
You're spilling everywhere!

10:21.721 --> 10:22.153
You!

10:22.155 --> 10:24.289
Stop making out
in my dad's chair!

10:24.291 --> 10:26.891
He lives there!

10:26.893 --> 10:27.759
(sighs)

10:27.761 --> 10:29.694
What the hell?
That's my mom's!

10:29.696 --> 10:31.262
Why are
you wearing that?

10:31.264 --> 10:32.764
Oh, it's a sweater party.

10:32.766 --> 10:33.431
That's not a thing.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.900
And I put a sign
on the stairs
that said "off limits."

10:35.902 --> 10:38.370
Ah, yeah,
that piece of yarn broke,

10:38.372 --> 10:41.339
So we all just kind of...
Helped ourselves.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.375
"we?"

10:43.909 --> 10:46.745
(indistinct conversations)

10:49.915 --> 10:50.682
Off!

10:50.684 --> 10:52.083
Everyone take it off!

10:52.085 --> 10:54.853
Yes! It's happening!
Take it off!

10:54.855 --> 10:55.920
Adam, go upstairs!

10:55.922 --> 10:58.456
Well, the sign says
it's off limits.

10:58.458 --> 10:59.858
The yarn is broken.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.693
Upstairs.

11:02.561 --> 11:03.795
I said "upstairs"!

11:03.797 --> 11:07.265
Okay.
This is officially nuts.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.467
You need to put
an end to this.

11:09.469 --> 11:10.168
Me? You're the adult!

11:10.170 --> 11:14.172
I'm the cool grandpa.
I can't be the bummer.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.874
You be the bummer.

11:15.876 --> 11:16.708
Oh!

11:16.710 --> 11:18.009
Uh, there's a pizza
on the record player.

11:18.011 --> 11:21.446
(needle scratching)
it's bad for the needle.

11:22.882 --> 11:25.150
You people are disgusting!

11:26.352 --> 11:27.886
What the hell
are you doing?

11:27.888 --> 11:29.320
It's a sweater party.

11:29.322 --> 11:30.388
That's not a thing!

11:30.390 --> 11:33.491
Stop encouraging this.
You need to shut it down.

11:33.493 --> 11:34.659
Shut it down?

11:34.661 --> 11:36.995
No way!
This is my party.

11:36.997 --> 11:41.566
And I say we rage on
until the crack of dawn!

11:41.568 --> 11:42.600
All: Yeah!

11:42.602 --> 11:47.572
Well, I say we each
pick up one piece of trash
and leave!

11:47.574 --> 11:48.773
All: Boo!

11:48.775 --> 11:51.810
(cups clatter)

11:51.812 --> 11:52.877
Smile all you want.
That's it.

11:52.879 --> 11:56.181
I'm calling the hotel
where mom and dad
are staying.

11:56.183 --> 11:57.816
I see what this is.

11:57.818 --> 11:58.383
You're jealous

11:58.385 --> 12:01.486
'cause I've thrown
the greatest party
of all time.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.655
Look around.
It's not your party.

12:03.657 --> 12:05.790
These are all
my friends.

12:06.192 --> 12:07.592
Yo, ari.

12:08.094 --> 12:08.893
Whose party is this?

12:08.895 --> 12:12.697
Erica's throwing
a going-away party
for the swedish dude.

12:12.832 --> 12:15.400
It doesn't matter.
Lexy bloom's here.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.035
She came to see me.

12:17.037 --> 12:19.037
Oh, did she?

12:25.111 --> 12:26.511
Barry, wait.

12:26.513 --> 12:29.247
I didn't mean to...
(sighs)

12:32.585 --> 12:34.018
That did not go well.

12:34.020 --> 12:34.853
No, it did not.

12:34.855 --> 12:37.055
Why are you
so mad at me?

12:37.057 --> 12:38.189
I saw the look
on your face.

12:38.191 --> 12:40.725
You were thrilled
to be back out there
on that court.

12:40.727 --> 12:42.494
You know why I don't talk
about the past?

12:42.496 --> 12:43.595
I'm gonna tell you.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.330
Because it was great.

12:45.332 --> 12:48.066
I was class president.
I was a basketball star.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.033
I was a hero.

12:49.035 --> 12:53.104
And now I'm just
none of those things.

12:53.239 --> 12:55.507
Have you ever tried
shooting the ball this way?

12:55.509 --> 12:59.010
It was a very common
shooting style!

12:59.012 --> 13:02.614
Adult adam: <i> Turns out,</i>
<i>my dad wasn't the only one</i>
<i>kicking himself.</i>

13:02.616 --> 13:03.648
<i>Barry's big chance</i>

13:03.650 --> 13:05.216
<i>To become a legend</i>
<i>and win over lexy bloom</i>

13:05.218 --> 13:08.153
<i>Had literally been</i>
<i>kissed goodbye.</i>

13:08.155 --> 13:10.855
What's shaking, gustav?
(scoffs)

13:10.857 --> 13:12.157
I wish I was gustav.

13:12.159 --> 13:15.426
Except for that
weird fish lunch
he always brings.

13:15.428 --> 13:19.364
So, why you out here,
missing your own party?

13:19.366 --> 13:21.566
Well, it has
come to my attention

13:21.568 --> 13:22.433
That this
is erica's party,

13:22.435 --> 13:25.036
And I'm just a big, giant,
invisible bag of suck.

13:25.038 --> 13:27.071
Oh, come on.
You're not invisible.

13:27.073 --> 13:30.141
You're barry goldberg,
the guy who freaked out
on the lunch lady

13:30.143 --> 13:31.409
Because they ran out
of pudding.

13:31.411 --> 13:34.879
Why is that the only thing
anyone ever remembers
about me?

13:34.881 --> 13:37.816
Hey, they promised pudding.
They had no pudding.

13:38.350 --> 13:40.185
It was a dark day.
Mmm.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.520
Look, I know you feel like
this year was a bust,

13:42.522 --> 13:45.690
But you did
a ton of cool stuff.

13:45.692 --> 13:47.792
Karate in the talent show.

13:47.794 --> 13:49.427
You're on
the wrestling team.

13:49.429 --> 13:50.261
You did that rap video

13:50.263 --> 13:51.996
About stone cold
groovin' on a ferris wheel.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.966
You like my rap?
It's hilarious.

13:54.968 --> 13:57.969
Wait, that's what
you were going for, right?

13:58.737 --> 13:59.370
Yeah!

13:59.372 --> 14:01.773
How do you know
so much stuff about me?

14:01.775 --> 14:03.107
Your sister's
my best friend.

14:03.109 --> 14:04.642
I've known you
my whole life,

14:04.644 --> 14:06.911
And I can honestly say
there's...

14:06.913 --> 14:08.513
No one like you.

14:08.515 --> 14:08.980
Thanks.

14:08.982 --> 14:11.416
Adult adam:
<i>Who knew my sister's wild,</i>
<i>bad-influence best friend</i>

14:11.418 --> 14:14.118
<i>Would be the one</i>
<i>to remind my brother</i>
<i>that he was special</i>

14:14.120 --> 14:17.622
<i>In his own bizarre,</i>
<i>barry kind of way?</i>

14:17.624 --> 14:18.790
(chuckles)
now stop pouting

14:18.792 --> 14:22.760
And come show
erica's friends
whose party it really is.

14:22.995 --> 14:25.697
Adult adam:
<i>For the first time in ages,</i>

14:25.699 --> 14:28.266
<i>Things were looking up</i>
<i>for my big bro.</i>

14:28.268 --> 14:30.735
<i>It didn't last long.</i>

14:31.737 --> 14:33.538
Oh, god!

14:33.540 --> 14:35.373
Oh, balls!

14:36.609 --> 14:39.244
Uh...Everybody try
and clean up a little bit!

14:39.246 --> 14:42.247
I... I'm going to bed!
Everyone, run!

14:42.249 --> 14:44.515
(screams)

14:44.517 --> 14:47.118
Adult adam: <i> As barry</i>
<i>watched my parents</i>
<i>get out of that car,</i>

14:47.120 --> 14:51.422
<i>He knew there was</i>
<i>only one thing to do...</i>
<i>Freak out.</i>

14:51.424 --> 14:53.558
Mom! Dad!

14:53.560 --> 14:54.392
Why are you home?

14:54.394 --> 14:55.326
You're supposed to be
at the hotel!

14:55.328 --> 14:57.962
There was a banquet!
Who skips a banquet?

14:57.964 --> 14:58.563
A party?

14:58.565 --> 15:00.331
I don't even like
my own kids,

15:00.333 --> 15:02.000
Let alone a house
full of other people's!

15:02.002 --> 15:05.770
Murray! Oh, my god.
They're wearing
my sweaters!

15:05.772 --> 15:07.572
No! Those aren't yours!

15:07.574 --> 15:10.241
It's a look that's happening!
Watch mtv!

15:10.243 --> 15:11.976
Yeah, I'm sure
all the young boys

15:11.978 --> 15:14.245
Are wearing
leopard sweaters.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.146
Hey!

15:15.148 --> 15:16.514
That's my leopard!

15:16.516 --> 15:17.215
Okay, fine.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.183
Clearly, you're gonna
kill me, and...

15:19.185 --> 15:20.251
Yes! Yes, I am!

15:20.253 --> 15:21.953
Do it, murray.
Do it with your hands.

15:21.955 --> 15:24.188
Just hear me out, please.

15:24.890 --> 15:26.257
I'm nothing like you, dad.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.860
I don't dominate
in high school.

15:28.862 --> 15:30.461
I don't hold
sports records.

15:30.463 --> 15:33.498
People only know me
'cause I get angry
at pudding.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.334
Listen, you've had
your glory days,

15:36.336 --> 15:38.403
And they sounded awesome.

15:38.405 --> 15:40.738
But this, in there,

15:40.740 --> 15:43.308
This is the best
I'm ever gonna do.

15:43.742 --> 15:46.945
Oh, boopie.
That's so sad.

15:46.947 --> 15:49.113
But you are
in so much trouble.

15:49.115 --> 15:49.714
But...Aww.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.950
I'm begging you.
This is my moment.

15:51.952 --> 15:55.987
All I'm asking for
is seven more hours
of nonstop partying.

15:55.989 --> 15:57.922
Absolutely not.

15:57.924 --> 15:59.090
You got 10 minutes.

15:59.092 --> 16:01.993
Seriously?
Yeah, but do me a favor.

16:01.995 --> 16:04.896
Make this a night
you'll always remember.

16:04.898 --> 16:07.699
You are the greatest father
on this planet.

16:07.866 --> 16:10.101
Adult adam:
<i>As my brother</i>
<i>desperately sprinted off</i>

16:10.103 --> 16:11.669
<i>For his 10 minutes</i>
<i>of glory,</i>

16:11.671 --> 16:13.838
<i>My dad realized</i>
<i>he could still be a hero</i>

16:13.840 --> 16:15.873
<i>To someone</i>
<i>who actually mattered.</i>

16:15.875 --> 16:18.409
Awful parenting choice.

16:18.411 --> 16:19.510
Just awful.

16:19.512 --> 16:23.214
You've seen him run.
He needs this.
