00:01.760 --> 00:04.297
*

00:10.710 --> 00:12.575
WATSON:
Fascinating so far.

00:12.610 --> 00:15.033
HOLMES:
It IS.

00:15.080 --> 00:17.344
I was being sarcastic.
I'm aware.

00:20.380 --> 00:22.780
How much longer
is this gonna take?

00:22.820 --> 00:25.380
Couple more hours
should do it.

00:25.420 --> 00:28.116
(clears throat) As I expected,
the rats, maggots

00:28.160 --> 00:30.458
and other scavengers
in this park have shown

00:30.490 --> 00:33.391
_ little interest_
In methamphetamine-tainted meat.

00:33.430 --> 00:35.455
Which goes to support
my belief

00:35.500 --> 00:38.094
that six years ago,
in the murder of Jarrod Ochoa,

00:38.130 --> 00:40.667
a known meth addict,
the medical examiner

00:40.700 --> 00:44.204
grossly miscalculated
the time of death.

00:44.240 --> 00:46.538
And we couldn't have
done this closer to home?

00:46.580 --> 00:50.072
In pursuit of the most
accurate data, Watson.

00:50.110 --> 00:53.216
Pork most closely
resembles human flesh.

00:53.250 --> 00:56.287
And Mr. Ochoa was found
on this very spot.

00:56.320 --> 00:58.618
You'd be surprised at
the specificity of insects

00:58.650 --> 01:01.357
depending on where
you are in this city.

01:03.130 --> 01:04.529
You know,
there's a species of ant

01:04.560 --> 01:06.425
which has been found to exist

01:06.460 --> 01:09.463
only within a ten-block stretch
of the Upper West Side.

01:09.500 --> 01:11.525
The ManhattAnt.

01:13.640 --> 01:15.665
I did not make that up.

01:15.700 --> 01:18.760
This lovely conversation
notwithstanding,

01:18.810 --> 01:20.402
I'm starving.

01:20.440 --> 01:22.408
(sighs) There's a restaurant
not far from here

01:22.450 --> 01:25.271
that got good reviews--
I'm gonna get us some food.

01:25.310 --> 01:26.538
Anything other than...

01:26.580 --> 01:28.844
Pork. Yeah, I figured.

01:29.820 --> 01:32.254
Mm. Say it again?

01:32.290 --> 01:34.656
San Gimignano.

01:34.690 --> 01:36.521
San...

01:36.560 --> 01:38.118
_Gimi...
Gimignano.

01:38.160 --> 01:39.821
Gimignano. Hmm.
(laughs)

01:39.860 --> 01:43.159
It's a little medieval town
on a hIll In Tuscany.

01:43.200 --> 01:46.431
It has stone arches and towers,
the whole deal.

01:46.470 --> 01:49.507
Mm.
It's supposed to be
the best gelato in the world.

01:49.540 --> 01:50.734
You ever been there?

01:50.770 --> 01:52.203
Mm-mm.

01:52.240 --> 01:54.629
Good. We can go together.

01:55.810 --> 01:58.540
*

01:59.580 --> 02:01.548
Something wrong?

02:02.550 --> 02:04.848
I'm just tired.

02:07.190 --> 02:10.557
All right. I'll get the check.

02:14.560 --> 02:16.528
WATSON:
Captain Gregson!

02:16.570 --> 02:17.798
Joan!

02:17.830 --> 02:19.536
What are you doing here?

02:19.570 --> 02:22.300
Uh, Sherlock and I are
staking out a... a steak.

02:22.340 --> 02:25.559
Well, it's kind of a long story,
but I came to get us some food.

02:25.610 --> 02:28.306
Oh. Well, th-th...
um, this is Paige.

02:28.340 --> 02:29.739
Paige, this is Joan.
Hi.

02:29.780 --> 02:31.407
Hi.

02:31.450 --> 02:34.169
She's, um, she's a doctor.

02:35.580 --> 02:37.218
Oh, what kind of doctor?

02:37.250 --> 02:38.649
A surgeon.

02:39.990 --> 02:43.448
Uh, I helped
the captain's friend out once.

02:43.490 --> 02:44.889
Mm. Yeah.

02:44.930 --> 02:46.898
Well, anyway,
good seeing you.

02:46.930 --> 02:48.818
Uh, it was nice to meet you.

02:48.860 --> 02:50.327
Likewise.

02:50.370 --> 02:51.689
(car horn honking)

02:51.730 --> 02:53.834
MAN: Hey!

02:53.870 --> 02:55.861
What are you, blind?

02:55.900 --> 02:57.458
I was backing in.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.603
Sorry, man. I got here first.

02:59.640 --> 03:01.574
WOMAN: Get out of the way!
I was pulling in!

03:01.610 --> 03:03.202
Hey, you better move
this damn car

03:03.250 --> 03:04.649
before I move it
for you!

03:04.680 --> 03:06.614
Dude, you're gonna give yourself
a heart attack.

03:06.650 --> 03:07.674
(horns honking)
MAN: Hey, move your ass!

03:07.720 --> 03:08.812
And you should really

03:08.850 --> 03:10.317
get your car out of traffic.

03:10.350 --> 03:11.647
All right.

03:11.690 --> 03:13.487
You think this is funny?

03:13.520 --> 03:16.648
(honking continues)
WOMAN: Come on, man, move it!

03:20.000 --> 03:21.399
(screaming)

03:21.430 --> 03:22.920
(body thuds)

03:30.040 --> 03:32.235
(siren wailing in distance)

03:33.710 --> 03:36.599
WOMAN: Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, did you see that?

03:36.650 --> 03:39.915
I'm calling 911.
She just...

03:39.950 --> 03:42.316
she just fell
out of nowhere.

03:45.590 --> 03:48.218
*

04:10.050 --> 04:14.714
(drawer opens)

04:14.750 --> 04:18.379
HAWES: Don't know what you think
you're gonna find over there.

04:18.420 --> 04:20.308
It's not a mystery
what happened to him.

04:20.360 --> 04:21.588
The woman on this table
fell on the guy on that table.

04:21.620 --> 04:24.327
The absence of mystery does not
mean there's nothing to learn.

04:24.360 --> 04:26.521
How often does one get
to examine the effects

04:26.560 --> 04:29.028
of one human body
crushing another?

04:30.430 --> 04:32.068
But if I'm interfering
with your work...

04:32.100 --> 04:33.965
Knock yourself out.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.316
I think this belongs
on your table.

04:47.780 --> 04:49.680
The extensive pitting
of the enamel

04:49.720 --> 04:51.085
and the wearing of the crown

04:51.120 --> 04:53.350
indicate it's from a
person of advanced age.

04:53.390 --> 04:54.880
And, of course, uh...

04:54.920 --> 04:56.785
her lipstick.

05:00.930 --> 05:03.592
This one's Rosalyn Graham, 76.

05:03.630 --> 05:05.427
That's Jason Leary, 28.

05:05.470 --> 05:08.359
The report's over here,
if you want to take a look.

05:10.040 --> 05:12.008
It said on the news
that she fell

05:12.040 --> 05:14.008
from her tenth floor balcony.

05:14.040 --> 05:15.871
Suicide, is it?
Cops thought

05:15.910 --> 05:17.707
either that or an accident.

05:17.750 --> 05:20.048
She'd been showing signs
of dementia, so it's possible

05:20.080 --> 05:21.843
she got confused and fell.

05:21.880 --> 05:24.041
I won't have an opinion of
my own till after the autopsy.

05:24.090 --> 05:25.887
Her neighbors
report seeing her

05:25.920 --> 05:28.514
wandering on numerous occasions,
lost in her own building.

05:28.560 --> 05:30.721
Also found an ottoman placed
against the railing

05:30.760 --> 05:33.854
of her balcony as if
she'd used it to climb.

05:33.900 --> 05:35.856
I doubt this woman's moved

05:35.900 --> 05:38.460
anything heavier than a teacup
in years.

05:38.500 --> 05:41.492
Judging from
the degenerative damage

05:41.540 --> 05:44.407
to the hands and feet,
I'd say she had...

05:44.440 --> 05:46.408
severe arthritis, wouldn't you?

05:46.440 --> 05:47.634
I'd need
a medical history

05:47.680 --> 05:49.773
to be sure, but, uh...

05:49.810 --> 05:52.142
Yeah, looks that way.
I think she'd have

05:52.180 --> 05:53.875
a hard time opening
a refrigerator door,

05:53.920 --> 05:56.514
let alone moving that ottoman
onto her balcony.

05:56.550 --> 05:58.609
You think_someone else
put It there?

05:58.650 --> 06:00.015
I think you
should just,

06:00.060 --> 06:01.880
you know... delay your report

06:01.920 --> 06:04.855
until I've had
a look at the scene.

06:04.890 --> 06:06.528
(sighs)
You know...

06:06.560 --> 06:08.528
if she was murdered,

06:08.560 --> 06:10.619
then Mr. Leary becomes
a homicide, too.

06:10.670 --> 06:11.796
And to think,
a moment ago

06:11.830 --> 06:13.661
you were calling
this case boring.

06:13.700 --> 06:16.635
I think Mrs. Graham might not
just be a murder victim,

06:16.670 --> 06:19.161
she might be
a murder weapon as well.

06:19.210 --> 06:21.531
(knocking)

06:21.580 --> 06:22.649
Someone call for a doctor?

06:22.680 --> 06:23.942
(sighs)

06:23.980 --> 06:26.073
Close the door, will you?

06:26.110 --> 06:28.044
Um, about last night...

06:28.080 --> 06:30.640
It's okay,
you don't have to explain.

06:30.690 --> 06:31.987
It's none of my business.

06:32.020 --> 06:33.783
Sit down.

06:33.820 --> 06:37.586
(sighs):
Me... and Paige.

06:37.630 --> 06:39.757
We go back a ways.

06:39.800 --> 06:43.588
We started seeing each other
about a year ago,

06:43.630 --> 06:46.633
but she wanted to keep it quiet
for my sake.

06:46.670 --> 06:48.490
What do you mean?

06:48.540 --> 06:50.861
She used to be a detective
in the 7-4.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.572
One night about ten years ago,

06:53.610 --> 06:56.579
her team searched the home
of a known drug dealer.

06:56.610 --> 06:58.498
Some of the cash

06:58.550 --> 07:02.441
they recovered never
made it back to the precinct.

07:03.690 --> 07:04.941
Oh.

07:04.990 --> 07:07.515
She went with the flow.
She took her cut.

07:07.560 --> 07:10.688
And not to make excuses,
but, uh...

07:10.730 --> 07:13.051
at the time,
she felt like she didn't have

07:13.100 --> 07:14.192
any choice.

07:14.230 --> 07:15.788
They all got caught.

07:15.830 --> 07:19.095
She cooperated--
she was never charged--

07:19.130 --> 07:22.839
but as part of the deal,
she put in her papers.

07:22.870 --> 07:26.237
And she thinks if other cops
knew about your relationship,

07:26.270 --> 07:28.807
it would reflect poorly on you.

07:28.840 --> 07:30.068
So...

07:30.110 --> 07:32.146
when I called you "Doctor"

07:32.180 --> 07:34.717
last night...
You were trying to hide the fact
that we work together.

07:34.750 --> 07:36.581
Yeah.

07:36.620 --> 07:39.248
Honestly, uh, I thought
she was over this months ago,

07:39.290 --> 07:41.679
the hang-ups, the worries,
and... all of a sudden,

07:41.720 --> 07:43.688
out of the blue,
couple of months ago,

07:43.730 --> 07:45.948
it became this... thing again.

07:45.990 --> 07:47.992
She could tell

07:48.030 --> 07:49.588
something was up.

07:49.630 --> 07:52.861
So when I told her
who you really were...

07:52.900 --> 07:54.265
She broke up with you?

07:54.300 --> 07:56.507
For my "own good."

07:56.540 --> 07:58.929
Wow. That's terrible.

08:01.280 --> 08:03.601
It was nice.

08:04.880 --> 08:07.075
Having someone again.

08:10.850 --> 08:12.681
(lock clicks)

08:15.120 --> 08:17.850
The super said
Mrs. Graham owns the building.

08:17.890 --> 08:19.926
Rest of the units
are rentals.

08:27.170 --> 08:29.092
So she had three adult children.

08:29.140 --> 08:30.300
They're being notified.

08:30.340 --> 08:32.570
Husband's dead, though;
she lived alone.

08:32.610 --> 08:33.770
(sniffing)

08:33.810 --> 08:34.970
Not entirely alone.

08:35.010 --> 08:36.648
(sniffing)

08:44.290 --> 08:45.939
Oh. Shih Tzu,

08:45.990 --> 08:48.151
if I'm not mistaken.

08:48.190 --> 08:50.681
There was a dog.

08:50.730 --> 08:52.049
Says here somebody picked it up.

08:52.090 --> 08:53.557
Maybe one of her kids?

08:53.600 --> 08:54.749
Hmm.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.791
The dog was well cared for,

08:56.830 --> 08:59.321
based on
the lavender-scented shampoo.

08:59.370 --> 09:01.167
Interesting that a woman

09:01.200 --> 09:05.307
with dementia could care
so attentively for a pet.

09:05.340 --> 09:09.208
(exhales) Why do old people
always have that smell?

09:09.240 --> 09:12.073
Uh, it's a buildup of a compound
called 2-nonenal in their sweat.

09:12.110 --> 09:13.338
Which is also responsible

09:13.380 --> 09:16.247
for the cardboard taste
of stale beer.

09:26.260 --> 09:28.922
I found her arthritis meds.

09:28.960 --> 09:31.224
My mom's on the same stuff.
It's strong.

09:31.270 --> 09:32.794
I'd say you're
probably right

09:32.840 --> 09:34.796
about Mrs. Graham
not movrng that ottoman.

09:34.840 --> 09:37.229
Well, whoever did move it
did so quite recently.

09:37.270 --> 09:38.965
It rained yesterday morning;

09:39.010 --> 09:41.331
it shows no sign of exposure
to the elements.

09:43.010 --> 09:44.773
Hmm.

09:44.810 --> 09:46.971
Pretty sure these tablets
should be pink.

09:48.680 --> 09:49.988
These are yellow.

09:50.020 --> 09:52.045
Switching an addled
woman's medication

09:52.090 --> 09:54.786
would be an ideal way
to incapacitate her,

09:54.820 --> 09:57.687
making it much easier
to hurl her from a balcony.

09:57.730 --> 09:59.994
Which makes
the next question,

10:00.030 --> 10:01.327
who else was up here?

10:01.360 --> 10:04.067
Building doesn't
have cameras,

10:04.100 --> 10:06.261
and the tenants say
they didn't see anyone.

10:12.440 --> 10:14.271
Well, lucky for us, then,
that whoever moved it

10:14.310 --> 10:16.175
might have left us
a sample of their DNA.

10:25.050 --> 10:27.382
I'll get CSU up here.

10:27.420 --> 10:29.615
(footsteps approaching)

10:31.460 --> 10:33.348
Hey, I got your text.

10:33.400 --> 10:36.699
So we're looking for someone who
threw an old lady off a balcony?

10:36.730 --> 10:38.220
Blood on the underside
of the ottoman

10:38.270 --> 10:39.897
has been submitted
for DNA analysis.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.965
It could be a while
before we have those results.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.968
Marcus and I were, however,

10:44.010 --> 10:46.399
able to identify
the mysterious pills

10:46.440 --> 10:49.807
found in place of Mrs. Graham's
arthritis medicine.

10:54.350 --> 10:56.238
Clonazepam.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.248
That's used
to treat seizures

10:58.290 --> 10:59.848
and anxiety disorders.
That's pretty heavy stuff

10:59.890 --> 11:01.050
to be taking by mistake.

11:01.090 --> 11:02.728
Would you say its misuse

11:02.760 --> 11:05.251
could cause someone
to appear confused,

11:05.290 --> 11:06.689
disoriented, forgetful?

11:06.730 --> 11:08.129
Absolutely.

11:08.160 --> 11:10.196
And might those symptoms
be mistaken for dementia?

11:10.230 --> 11:11.788
You think that's
what the killer wanted.

11:11.830 --> 11:13.991
Mrs. Graham had no prior history

11:14.040 --> 11:16.190
of either senility
or depression.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.333
Inducing signs of dementia
in recent weeks could have

11:18.370 --> 11:20.930
set the stage for the tale
we were all meant to believe--

11:20.980 --> 11:22.402
that in her confused state,

11:22.440 --> 11:25.273
she wandered off her balcony
to her tragic end.

11:25.310 --> 11:28.347
So you think it was someone
who had access to her meds.

11:28.380 --> 11:31.144
Plus, you said she had money.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.487
Did she have children?

11:34.920 --> 11:36.251
a physician,

11:36.290 --> 11:38.258
is the only one
who lives locally.

11:38.290 --> 11:40.497
He's also proven difficult
to reach. He's not at home

11:40.530 --> 11:43.419
or his office. Not answering
any of his phones.

11:43.470 --> 11:45.222
You're welcome to _sit in
on the Interrogation

11:45.270 --> 11:47.135
when the police find him.
Unless, of course,

11:47.170 --> 11:49.365
you prefer to continue
cyberstalking

11:49.400 --> 11:51.231
the captain's paramour.

11:51.270 --> 11:53.500
You witnessed their secret tryst
last night, he invited you

11:53.540 --> 11:55.872
to the precinct to discuss,
and now you're reading up

11:55.910 --> 11:58.970
on a defrocked female cop.

11:59.010 --> 12:00.841
When the captain confided
in you this morning,

12:00.880 --> 12:02.245
did he ask you to pry into

12:02.280 --> 12:04.817
the affairs
of once-Detective Cowan?

12:04.850 --> 12:06.488
I'm not prying.
Obviously.

12:06.520 --> 12:09.057
She didn't want anyone to know
about their relationship.

12:09.090 --> 12:12.082
I bumped into them,
she broke up with him.

12:12.130 --> 12:13.927
That's unfortunate,
but it's hardly your fault.

12:13.960 --> 12:16.224
I know. I thought
I would reach out to her,

12:16.260 --> 12:18.319
let her know
I can keep a secret.
(phone dings)

12:24.410 --> 12:26.230
The newly-orphaned
Dr. Graham has

12:26.270 --> 12:28.477
turned himself
In voluntarIIy.

12:28.510 --> 12:31.240
In the company of an attorney.

12:31.280 --> 12:33.942
MAN: This has all gotten
horribly out of hand.

12:33.980 --> 12:36.847
Yes, I replaced my mother's
arthritis medication,

12:36.890 --> 12:38.846
but I never meant
for her to die.

12:38.890 --> 12:42.485
So you thought she would just
float to the sidewalk?

12:42.520 --> 12:44.158
What? No.

12:44.190 --> 12:45.953
What are you talking about?

12:45.990 --> 12:48.322
We know she didn't go over
that balcony on her own.

12:48.360 --> 12:49.520
She had help.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.869
Are you saying that...

12:51.900 --> 12:53.492
She was my mother.

12:53.540 --> 12:56.065
Dr. Graham, we were
under the impression

12:56.100 --> 12:57.499
you were here to confess.

12:57.540 --> 12:59.064
To switching her meds.

12:59.110 --> 13:01.078
I just wanted her
to seem out of it.

13:01.110 --> 13:02.270
I did-didn't kill her.

13:02.310 --> 13:04.278
LAWYER: We were
under the impression

13:04.310 --> 13:05.868
you thought she fell.

13:05.910 --> 13:08.378
Oh, my God. I was thinking
this was all my fault.

13:08.420 --> 13:10.547
Are you telling me
she was murdered?

13:10.590 --> 13:13.514
You said you wanted your mother
to appear disoriented. Why?

13:13.560 --> 13:15.255
(sighs)

13:15.290 --> 13:18.225
A few months ago
she rewrote the will.

13:18.260 --> 13:20.956
She told us at Thanksgiving
she was cutting us out,

13:21.000 --> 13:23.525
said we were
a bunch of spOIled Ingrates

13:23.570 --> 13:26.095
who cared more
about her money than about her.

13:26.130 --> 13:27.893
So far, I'm inclined to agree.

13:27.940 --> 13:31.103
I visited her every week.
I brought her her groceries,

13:31.140 --> 13:33.870
made sure she was all right.
I earned my share of that money.

13:33.910 --> 13:35.377
WATSON: And you thought
if she showed signs

13:35.410 --> 13:37.571
of dementia, you could
have her ruled incompetent

13:37.610 --> 13:39.146
and have the will thrown out.

13:39.180 --> 13:40.875
That's why you gave her
the Clonazepam.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.444
The hearing was gonna be
in a few weeks.

13:42.480 --> 13:44.016
GREGSON: I don't say this
very often,

13:44.050 --> 13:48.009
but your lawyer
should tell you to talk less.

13:48.060 --> 13:49.186
You just copped to a motive.

13:49.220 --> 13:51.256
Actually, from where
I'm sitting,

13:51.290 --> 13:52.894
he just proved
he didn't have a motive.

13:52.930 --> 13:54.022
HOLMES:
Because if she dies

13:54.060 --> 13:56.028
prior to the competency hearing,

13:56.060 --> 13:58.267
the present will stands
and he and his siblings

13:58.300 --> 14:00.996
won't see a penny unless they
successfully contest it.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.564
So who benefits most
from the will now?

14:02.600 --> 14:04.431
Maybe we should be
talking to them.

14:04.470 --> 14:08.031
Mom left the entire estate
In trust to EustaCIa Vye.

14:08.080 --> 14:10.139
You can try

14:10.180 --> 14:12.398
talking to her,
but you won't get much back.

14:12.450 --> 14:13.644
Eustacia Vye?

14:13.680 --> 14:15.443
That a friend of hers?

14:15.480 --> 14:17.038
HOLMES:
Her best friend.

14:17.090 --> 14:20.116
As in "man's best friend."

14:20.160 --> 14:23.926
Eustacia Vye is Ms. Graham's
prize-winning Shih Tzu.

14:26.030 --> 14:27.952
We can rule her out
as the killer.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.667
Rosalyn was
a tough old broad.

14:39.710 --> 14:42.008
You know, a lot of guys at the
firm didn't like her, but I did.

14:42.040 --> 14:44.099
We understood each other.

14:44.150 --> 14:45.503
I know it's morbid,
but the first thing

14:45.550 --> 14:48.075
I thought when I found
out she died was, "Well,

14:48.120 --> 14:50.987
she always said she'd leave
that place feet first."

14:51.020 --> 14:52.089
Did she?

14:52.120 --> 14:53.382
I'm sorry, what do you mean?

14:53.420 --> 14:54.512
When you dropped her,

14:54.560 --> 14:56.084
which way was she pointing?

14:56.120 --> 14:59.123
Um, wait a minute,
I-I thought she fell.

15:00.430 --> 15:01.624
I'm sorry, are you saying

15:01.660 --> 15:03.059
you think someone killed her?

15:03.100 --> 15:04.294
You think that I--?

15:04.330 --> 15:05.592
BELL:
You were her lavwer.

15:05.630 --> 15:07.029
When she rewrote her will,

15:07.070 --> 15:08.367
she named you as trustee
of her estate.

15:08.400 --> 15:09.936
That means you're
in control of her assets

15:09.970 --> 15:11.437
including her building--

15:11.470 --> 15:12.971
HOLMES: Where, according
to her explicit instructions,

15:13.010 --> 15:15.501
you are now to reside
with Eustacia Vye,

15:15.540 --> 15:18.304
ensuring she lives out
the remainder of her days

15:18.350 --> 15:19.601
in the surroundings

15:19.650 --> 15:21.572
and lifestyle
to which she's accustomed.

15:21.620 --> 15:23.247
You must be looking forward
to moving day.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.349
It's not often
the dog house Is a step up.

15:25.390 --> 15:27.517
(scoffs)
Wow, do you have it wrong.

15:27.560 --> 15:30.188
Really? You were just telling us
what kindred spirits you were.

15:30.230 --> 15:33.222
Maybe you sweet-talked her
into changing her will.

15:33.260 --> 15:34.727
We were "kindred spirits"

15:34.760 --> 15:36.352
because she was a hard ass.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.960
No one ever_sweet-tall_<ed
that woman Into anythIng.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.195
No, she changed her will
to give her kids the finger.

15:41.240 --> 15:42.969
I tried to talk her out of it.

15:43.010 --> 15:44.637
If she was so obstinate,
why bother?

15:44.670 --> 15:46.365
Those were her wishes.
You were her lavwer.

15:46.410 --> 15:48.139
Why argue against them?

15:48.180 --> 15:50.205
Because I've seen the way
these things go.

15:50.250 --> 15:51.740
When Leona Helmsley died,

15:51.780 --> 15:54.010
she left $12 million to her dog.

15:54.050 --> 15:56.143
You think her heirs
didn't fight that?

15:56.180 --> 15:57.488
It took years
to sort out.

15:57.520 --> 16:00.250
Ate up half the estate
in legal bills.

16:00.290 --> 16:02.485
And the same thing's
gonna happen here.

16:02.520 --> 16:04.556
Her kids have already put
a freeze on her accounts.

16:04.590 --> 16:07.058
Look.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.591
I didn't go to law school
to run a doggy daycare.

16:09.630 --> 16:12.019
Okay? (chuckles)

16:12.070 --> 16:14.038
I'm not staying in New York
much longer anyway.

16:14.070 --> 16:17.437
I just accepted an offer from a
firm in Chicago a few weeks ago.

16:17.470 --> 16:20.371
Feel free to confirm that
WIth my bosses.

16:20.410 --> 16:22.571
Some other associate can live

16:22.610 --> 16:25.306
with Miss Eustacia.

16:25.350 --> 16:27.238
Unless...

16:27.280 --> 16:29.544
either of you wants it?

16:32.490 --> 16:35.414
(bell dings)

16:37.490 --> 16:38.752
Hi.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.451
Oh.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.728
It's Joan, right?

16:41.760 --> 16:43.466
Yeah.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.058
Uh, the captain didn't send me,

16:45.100 --> 16:46.328
in case you were wondering.

16:46.370 --> 16:48.736
He told you we had it out.

16:48.770 --> 16:51.204
He told me that you were worried

16:51.240 --> 16:53.538
that you were gonna
hurt his career.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.468
That's right.

16:55.510 --> 16:58.206
Look, you made a mistake
ten years ago,

16:58.250 --> 17:00.241
and you paid for it.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.077
You really don't think
other cops

17:02.120 --> 17:03.587
are gonna see it
the same way he does?

17:05.220 --> 17:07.780
You consult for him, right?

17:07.820 --> 17:11.119
I'm not a cop,
if that's what you're asking.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.754
Well, uh, y-you know,

17:13.800 --> 17:15.654
you coming here,
it's very sweet,

17:15.700 --> 17:18.362
but you're talking about
something you don't understand.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.391
Then please
explain it to me.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.658
I've worked for the captain
for a long time.

17:22.700 --> 17:24.361
He stuck his neck out
for me and my partner

17:24.410 --> 17:25.729
more times than I can count.

17:25.770 --> 17:27.328
If he says he can
take the heat for you,

17:27.380 --> 17:29.132
he will.

17:29.180 --> 17:31.501
I'm surprised you don't know
that about him already.

17:33.820 --> 17:37.312
Unless there's some_other reason
you're ca||Ing It quIts.

17:37.350 --> 17:40.410
I'd like you to leave now.

17:40.460 --> 17:44.055
He's one of the best guys
that I know.

17:45.760 --> 17:48.490
Whatever it is,
you should tell him the truth.

18:03.550 --> 18:07.418
Nice place.

18:07.450 --> 18:09.509
Making an offer?

18:09.550 --> 18:10.539
No need.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.285
It's already in the family.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.515
_ One of Father's_
Investment propertIes.

18:14.560 --> 18:18.428
I can just imagine him
standing here going,

18:18.460 --> 18:21.520
"Need it, need it,
got it, got it, need it."

18:21.560 --> 18:23.425
Want to tell me what
we're d0Ing here?

18:23.470 --> 18:26.291
and what it has to do
with a lovechild

18:26.330 --> 18:28.560
of a toilet
and a corkscrew.
Hmm.

18:28.600 --> 18:30.158
We're due at an
appomtment quIte soon,

18:30.210 --> 18:31.859
and I thought biding
my time up here

18:31.910 --> 18:34.435
would help put me in the mind
of Rosalyn Graham's killer.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.175
Okay.

18:36.210 --> 18:37.871
I have a new
theory of motIve.

18:37.910 --> 18:40.413
Visited the law firm
of Rosalyn Graham's attorney.

18:40.450 --> 18:43.544
They confirmed everything
he told Marcus and me.

18:43.590 --> 18:46.582
In the short term,
at least, no one can profit

18:46.620 --> 18:48.315
from her estate.

18:48.360 --> 18:50.555
It will be embroiled
in a legal quagmire for years.

18:50.590 --> 18:53.821
Included in that quagmire is
a deal she was about to make

18:53.860 --> 18:56.749
involving an old friend
of ours, William Hull.

18:56.800 --> 18:58.324
The real estate mogul?

18:58.370 --> 19:01.237
Yes. That...

19:01.270 --> 19:02.897
is Rosalyn's building there.

19:02.940 --> 19:04.339
And this

19:04.370 --> 19:07.339
is Hull's latest monstrosity.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.837
Scheduled for construction
at the end of her block.

19:09.880 --> 19:12.405
So, Rosalyn was gonna
sell Hull her building?

19:12.450 --> 19:13.474
Not the building.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.374
The air above it.

19:15.420 --> 19:18.514
Every building in the city

19:18.550 --> 19:21.610
comes with_a finite
amount of aIr rIghts,

19:21.660 --> 19:24.720
limiting the space
that one can build up, hmm?

19:27.830 --> 19:30.628
It's to stop the city
growing out of control.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.626
Overcrowding the streets.

19:32.670 --> 19:34.535
Public services.

19:34.570 --> 19:38.438
But a developer can buy
another building's air rights.

19:38.470 --> 19:42.406
So long as that owner
promises never to use them.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.499
So Hull needed
Rosalyn's air rights.

19:44.550 --> 19:46.848
Not just hers-- those of every
other building on the block.

19:48.480 --> 19:49.845
You acquire this one,
this one, this one.

19:49.880 --> 19:53.281
Pretty soon, huh,
got yourself a skyscraper.

19:53.320 --> 19:55.413
Only now that Rosalyn's
estate is tied up,

19:55.460 --> 19:58.281
Hull can't acquire her rights.

19:58.330 --> 20:00.651
And since the law requires
that air rights

20:00.700 --> 20:03.419
only be sold
across adjacent lots,

20:03.470 --> 20:04.767
the loss of her rights
means he'll never be able

20:04.800 --> 20:06.358
to get the rest of the block's.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.539
So his project is
essentially a nonstarter.

20:08.570 --> 20:10.367
Dead before they even
break ground.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.298
You think whoever killed Rosalyn

20:12.340 --> 20:14.877
did it to stop Hull's project
from moving forward.

20:14.910 --> 20:16.571
I'd like to ask Mr. Hull

20:16.610 --> 20:18.009
about his thoughts
on the matter,

20:18.050 --> 20:19.699
who's behind it.

20:19.750 --> 20:22.844
Great, well, you let me know
as soon as you know.

20:22.880 --> 20:24.882
Yeah.

20:26.750 --> 20:28.581
Mr. Hull?

20:30.390 --> 20:32.984
Don't tell me.
I'm excellent with faces.

20:34.730 --> 20:36.357
The detectives.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.561
Sherlock Holmes,
Joan Watson.

20:38.600 --> 20:41.433
You did some_ work for me
on a caSIno deal.

20:41.470 --> 20:42.835
Not how we'd characterize it.

20:42.870 --> 20:44.462
We know you're having
a tough day

20:44.510 --> 20:45.761
with Rosalyn Graham's murder.

20:45.810 --> 20:47.630
We just wanted a few minutes
of your time.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.739
I remember now.

20:49.780 --> 20:52.578
You as much as accused me
of beIng a kIller.

20:52.610 --> 20:54.578
Today I don't have time.

20:54.620 --> 20:56.019
You misunderstand.

20:56.050 --> 20:57.984
We believe that Rosalyn Graham
was murdered

20:58.020 --> 21:00.386
specifically to hinder
your project.

21:00.420 --> 21:02.388
So as much as it pains me
to say it,

21:02.420 --> 21:03.751
we're on the same side.

21:13.370 --> 21:15.065
Your design, is it?

21:15.100 --> 21:17.864
It is.

21:17.910 --> 21:20.037
Straight lines hurt you
as a child?

21:21.040 --> 21:22.837
Everyone's a critic.

21:22.880 --> 21:25.804
Reception's been harsh, has it?

21:25.850 --> 21:27.613
Polarizing.

21:27.650 --> 21:29.015
People love it or hate it.

21:29.050 --> 21:31.712
But, uh, it's got them talking.

21:31.750 --> 21:34.457
No one killed anyone
over this design.

21:34.490 --> 21:36.014
You have a particular enemy
in mind?

21:36.060 --> 21:37.459
Off the top of my head?

21:37.490 --> 21:39.822
Other developers
that wanted the lot.

21:39.860 --> 21:42.328
A steel company
I didn't hire once.

21:42.360 --> 21:44.624
Any of my ex-wives.
WATSON: So, what is

21:44.670 --> 21:46.763
your next step?
Is the building definitely dead?

21:46.800 --> 21:49.598
That's what today's meeting
was to discuss.

21:49.640 --> 21:52.461
Maybe we can get the rights
another way.

21:52.510 --> 21:55.035
Maybe we can find
an alternative site.

21:55.080 --> 21:57.503
Maybe I cut a deal
with the city to give me

21:57.550 --> 22:01.509
the rights if I offer to build
an opera house uptown.

22:01.550 --> 22:03.586
The project is
that important to you, is it?

22:03.620 --> 22:06.987
What are you leaving behind,
Mr. Holmes?

22:07.020 --> 22:08.908
I build the future.

22:08.960 --> 22:12.054
Long after we're gone, people
will look around out there,

22:12.090 --> 22:13.955
and they'll see me.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.958
And this one...

22:17.000 --> 22:20.538
this one is a legacy-maker.

22:20.570 --> 22:21.867
For Busquet

22:21.900 --> 22:23.936
and for me.
There's a note here

22:23.970 --> 22:25.801
that says
a copy of this letter was sent

22:25.840 --> 22:28.400
to building security.
Can I ask why?

22:28.440 --> 22:31.000
It's from an organization
called Save the West Side.

22:33.010 --> 22:36.013
We had an incident
outside on the street.

22:36.050 --> 22:38.143
Save the West Side was
protesting, and their leader

22:38.190 --> 22:40.886
hit one of my employees
with a picket sign.

22:40.920 --> 22:42.683
Charges weren't pressed,

22:42.720 --> 22:44.824
but after that, we just sent
everything we ever got from them

22:44.860 --> 22:46.452
to security.

22:46.490 --> 22:48.094
"Your building
is a modernist nightmare."

22:48.130 --> 22:51.861
Mmm. "A blight that must be
stopped at all costs."

22:51.900 --> 22:54.562
You didn't think threats
from a violent protestor

22:54.600 --> 22:55.760
merited mention?

22:55.800 --> 22:57.563
Honestly, I forgot about it.

22:57.610 --> 22:59.498
Run-ins with neighborhood groups
always come up

22:59.540 --> 23:01.098
during a project
like this.

23:01.140 --> 23:04.746
They just don't want another
Starbucks on their corner.

23:04.780 --> 23:07.078
So you say the incident involved
the man that wrote this letter?

23:07.110 --> 23:09.169
The group's leader,
Derek O'Neal.

23:09.220 --> 23:11.415
According
to Mr. O'Neal's address here,

23:11.450 --> 23:12.815
your building would have
completely obstructed

23:12.850 --> 23:14.852
his Central Park view.

23:14.890 --> 23:16.187
You're the real estate expert.

23:16.220 --> 23:17.983
How much
would the loss of his view

23:18.030 --> 23:19.827
affect the value
of his property?

23:19.860 --> 23:21.851
A million dollars?

23:21.900 --> 23:24.721
That might've meant more to him
than a new Starbucks.

23:28.740 --> 23:30.799
Hello. Excuse me.

23:30.840 --> 23:32.933
Uh, we're looking

23:32.970 --> 23:35.939
for Save the West Side.
This is the right place, yes?

23:35.980 --> 23:38.073
Not anymore. We're done.

23:38.110 --> 23:40.943
You want to look at the space,
talk to the building manager.

23:40.980 --> 23:42.811
Fourth floor.

23:42.850 --> 23:45.148
Rosalyn's death sticks a fork
in Hull's building,

23:45.190 --> 23:47.146
and these guys
call it a day?

23:47.190 --> 23:50.887
Either news travels fast or,
uh, we're on the right track.

23:50.930 --> 23:53.797
WOMAN: Can I help you
with something?

23:53.830 --> 23:55.650
WATSON: We're not here
for the space.

23:55.700 --> 23:57.520
We're consultants
with the NYPD.

23:57.570 --> 23:59.128
What makes you think
that William Hull

23:59.170 --> 24:01.138
is pulling the plug
on his development?

24:01.170 --> 24:03.502
What did you say?
HOLMES: Well, no
announcement's been made

24:03.540 --> 24:05.758
in the news yet, and here
you are, closing your doors.

24:05.810 --> 24:07.630
We're-we're just curious
how you found out.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.170
Hull's not putting up
the building?

24:09.210 --> 24:10.677
It's not looking good.
Are you telling us

24:10.710 --> 24:11.677
that you didn't know?

24:11.710 --> 24:12.301
No.

24:13.780 --> 24:15.748
Are you saying that we won?

24:15.780 --> 24:18.044
Could you tell us where
we could find Derek O'Neal?

24:18.090 --> 24:19.819
He's the head
of the group, right?

24:19.850 --> 24:22.182
You say you're with the police?

24:22.220 --> 24:24.188
You don't know?

24:24.230 --> 24:26.824
Derek is the reason
we're shuttIng down.

24:26.860 --> 24:28.555
He was this group.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.818
The rest of us
didn't have the heart to go on.

24:30.870 --> 24:33.225
There was a break-in here
last Friday night.

24:33.270 --> 24:35.238
He was stabbed to death.

24:35.270 --> 24:37.067
Right over there.

24:43.240 --> 24:45.572
Well, now, we're sorry
for the intrusion.

24:45.610 --> 24:48.477
Condolences on your loss.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.646
If that's Derek O'Neal's blood,
there's no way

24:52.690 --> 24:54.089
he could have killed
Rosalyn Graham.

24:54.120 --> 24:57.009
Because somebody killed him
five days ago.

25:02.130 --> 25:04.121
BELL: Derek O'Neal was out
with friends when he realized

25:04.170 --> 25:05.865
he'd left his phone
at the office. He went back.

25:05.900 --> 25:07.868
Members of his group
found him the next morning,

25:07.900 --> 25:09.868
stab wound to the chest,

25:09.900 --> 25:11.868
few thousand dollars worth
of computers gone,

25:11.910 --> 25:13.207
so detectives
who caught It thought

25:13.240 --> 25:14.730
it was a robbery gone wrong.

25:14.780 --> 25:16.736
We think it was
less random than that.

25:16.780 --> 25:20.739
CSU found a size-11 shoe print
on the office carpet.

25:20.780 --> 25:22.975
Didn't belong to anyone
in the group.

25:23.020 --> 25:24.783
Police were not able
to identify the tread.

25:24.820 --> 25:26.617
But I was.

25:26.650 --> 25:29.619
WATSON: The shape of the heal
is unique to Luzzattos,

25:29.660 --> 25:31.981
an Italian dress shoe
that retails for $500.

25:32.030 --> 25:33.179
So unless the thief robbed
an investment banker

25:33.230 --> 25:34.720
on his way to kill O'Neal...

25:34.760 --> 25:36.250
You think his murder
had something to do

25:36.300 --> 25:38.120
with Hull's building?

25:38.170 --> 25:40.126
O'Neal was the project's
most vocal opponent.

25:40.170 --> 25:43.606
Between the timing and the shoe,
seems an unlikely coincidence.

25:43.640 --> 25:45.062
Do we think _
there's any connectIon

25:45.110 --> 25:47.670
between his murder
and Rosalyn Graham's?

25:47.710 --> 25:49.007
They both had ties
to the building

25:49.040 --> 25:50.701
that was supposed to go up.

25:50.750 --> 25:53.844
But on the surface, the murders
have opposing motives.

25:53.880 --> 25:56.246
Rosalyn's murder will in all
likelihood doom the project,

25:56.280 --> 25:58.248
which is exactly
what O'Neal wanted.

25:58.290 --> 26:00.781
A single theory
to explain both homicides

26:00.820 --> 26:02.185
has yet to present itself.

26:02.220 --> 26:04.120
BELL: Could be we're looking
at two killers.

26:04.160 --> 26:05.252
Some kind of turf war.

26:05.290 --> 26:06.723
Hull's side kills an activist,

26:06.760 --> 26:08.159
so the activists kill
his building.

26:08.200 --> 26:09.690
Throwing Mrs. Graham
from her balcony seems

26:09.730 --> 26:11.698
too circuitous a route
for revenge.

26:11.730 --> 26:13.288
Then keep it simple.

26:13.330 --> 26:16.037
O'Neal was trying to stop
William Hull's building.

26:16.070 --> 26:18.038
Anyone check Hull's shoe size?

26:18.070 --> 26:19.628
BELL: No, but I will.

26:19.670 --> 26:20.773
I was gonna take some guys
up to his office,

26:20.810 --> 26:22.175
interview his team.

26:22.210 --> 26:23.279
Watson and I will keep
our focus

26:23.310 --> 26:24.607
on Rosalyn's murder.

26:24.650 --> 26:26.106
As evidenced
by the hate mail we took

26:26.150 --> 26:27.617
from Busquet's office,

26:27.650 --> 26:29.242
the building had
no shortage of detractors.

26:29.280 --> 26:31.180
We can also check the city
council minutes, public records,

26:31.220 --> 26:33.245
see if anyone else
spoke out against it.

26:33.290 --> 26:36.054
Well, let me know what you find.

26:40.430 --> 26:42.921
So when you said that
"we" would look through

26:42.960 --> 26:44.268
all this stuff
from the city,

26:44.300 --> 26:46.120
what you really meant...
was me.

26:46.170 --> 26:47.990
I was just speaking
with a friend

26:48.040 --> 26:49.996
who's an engineer
at the Department of Buildings.

26:50.040 --> 26:51.860
He said they might be aware
of additional complaints

26:51.910 --> 26:53.730
against Hull's
would-be building.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.736
Because what we need is more
paperwork to look through.

26:55.780 --> 26:57.748
Oh, did you know
that in a building

26:57.780 --> 26:59.748
without fire sprinklers,

26:59.780 --> 27:03.079
the maximum travel distance to
stairwells needs to be 150 feet,

27:03.120 --> 27:06.419
but in a building with
sprinklers, it can be 200?

27:06.450 --> 27:08.953
Well, it seems rude
to make evacuees run

27:08.990 --> 27:10.958
an additional 50 feet
th|st also gettIng wet,

27:10.990 --> 27:12.355
but I assume _
that's not your p0Int.

27:12.390 --> 27:16.099
My point is I'm gonna
tear my hair out.

27:16.130 --> 27:17.768
It's a capital mistake
to theorize before one has data.

27:17.800 --> 27:19.427
You know that.

27:19.470 --> 27:21.290
Speaking of data,
what did you learn

27:21.340 --> 27:23.968
when you went to visit
the captain's lover yesterday?

27:24.010 --> 27:25.261
Not a damn thing.

27:25.310 --> 27:26.402
Told you you should
leave it alone.

27:26.440 --> 27:28.271
She did not break up with him

27:28.310 --> 27:31.143
'cause s_he_was concerned
about tarnIshIng hIs reputatIon.

27:31.180 --> 27:32.875
There's something more.

27:32.910 --> 27:35.378
I thought you said there
wasn't any additional data.

27:35.420 --> 27:37.843
There isn't, but I could just
tell there was something more.

27:37.890 --> 27:39.915
Have you shared those insights
with the captain?

27:39.950 --> 27:41.781
I wouldn't even know
what to say to him.

27:41.820 --> 27:43.185
"She lied about why
she broke up with you."

27:43.220 --> 27:44.221
How's it gonna help him?

27:46.230 --> 27:48.198
This is weird.

27:48.230 --> 27:51.199
Derek O'Neal spoke
at a city council meeting

27:51.230 --> 27:53.061
a few months ago.

27:53.100 --> 27:55.933
He brought up problems
in an environmental study

27:55.970 --> 27:57.938
that Hull's team did
on that site.

27:57.970 --> 27:59.005
So?

27:59.040 --> 28:00.439
So how did they get that study?

28:00.470 --> 28:02.074
It was internal.

28:02.110 --> 28:03.998
Stuff like that doesn't get
submitted to the city

28:04.050 --> 28:05.779
until much later;
trust me, I've read a lot

28:05.810 --> 28:08.449
about how buildings get approved
in the last hour.

28:08.480 --> 28:09.811
Um...

28:09.850 --> 28:12.182
I remember reading
an interview.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.258
Yes, this is from an interview
he gave. Right here.

28:16.290 --> 28:19.782
He quotes an e-mail from Hull
saying that he didn't care

28:19.830 --> 28:22.958
about a park
they would have to bulldoze.

28:26.300 --> 28:28.268
You _think there was_ a mole
lnSIde Hull's organIzatIon

28:28.300 --> 28:30.803
who was secretly feeding
information to O'Neal?

28:30.840 --> 28:33.365
It would explain
why the killer stole

28:33.410 --> 28:34.934
the computers
from O'Neal's office.

28:34.980 --> 28:37.073
O'Neal got his hands
on incriminating evidence,

28:37.110 --> 28:40.739
and the killer had
to get it back.

28:40.780 --> 28:42.475
WATSON: Several people
at "Save the West Side"

28:42.520 --> 28:45.080
said they saw Derek meet up
with someone they didn't know.

28:45.120 --> 28:47.486
The description was enough
to ID the person.

28:47.520 --> 28:50.353
He worked as a filing clerk here
until you fired him last week.

28:50.390 --> 28:52.153
His name is Austin Reem.

28:52.190 --> 28:54.192
BELL: Mr. Reem
admitted to us

28:54.230 --> 28:56.858
he'd been selling inside
information to Derek O'Neal.

28:56.900 --> 28:58.197
He said you
personally caught him

28:58.230 --> 29:01.233
copying files
after hours one night.

29:01.270 --> 29:02.464
Your lawyers
threatened him,

29:02.500 --> 29:03.762
forced him
to reveal O'Neal's name

29:03.810 --> 29:05.163
and sign a gag order.

29:05.210 --> 29:07.030
Then they had him
clear out his desk.

29:07.070 --> 29:09.937
That was Thursday, one day
before O'Neal was killed.

29:09.980 --> 29:11.948
This is ridiculous.

29:11.980 --> 29:15.245
You think I killed this guy
O'Neal over a few files?

29:15.280 --> 29:17.077
They would have become
public record aanay

29:17.120 --> 29:19.816
in a matter of weeks.

29:19.850 --> 29:21.818
Yes, I fired Reem.

29:21.860 --> 29:25.125
I found a spy in my office,
and I plugged a leak.

29:25.160 --> 29:27.481
How is any of that
motive for murder?

29:27.530 --> 29:29.350
HOLMES: Well, it depends
what was in the files.

29:29.400 --> 29:30.822
Perhaps it
contained evidence

29:30.870 --> 29:32.121
that you bribed
a public official.

29:32.170 --> 29:33.831
Perhaps you were cutting corners
on safety codes.

29:33.870 --> 29:36.088
BELL: We don't think
O'Neal knew what he had,

29:36.140 --> 29:38.108
or he would have
used It agaInst you.

29:38.140 --> 29:40.108
Whatever it was,
we're guessing

29:40.140 --> 29:41.971
you couldn't just
leave it out in the world.

29:42.010 --> 29:46.276
The information in those files,
it was nuisance stuff.

29:46.310 --> 29:49.279
Do we skate the legal edge
now and then?

29:49.320 --> 29:51.242
Of course we do, everyone does.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.986
It's the only way
to get things done.

29:54.020 --> 29:55.988
But there was nothing in there
that broke the law

29:56.020 --> 29:58.488
and certainly nothing even
remotely worth killing over.

29:58.530 --> 29:59.986
Then I'm sure
you won't mInd,

30:00.030 --> 30:01.998
uh, sharing those
leaked files with us.

30:02.030 --> 30:04.362
Mr. Reem provided a list,
if that helps.

30:04.400 --> 30:05.992
No.

30:06.030 --> 30:07.520
Those files contain

30:07.570 --> 30:10.539
proprietary
and confidential information.

30:10.570 --> 30:13.539
The studies this firm does,
my designs,

30:13.570 --> 30:15.504
whether you like them or not,

30:15.540 --> 30:18.907
they're what we make here,
and they have monetary value.

30:18.950 --> 30:22.078
You want those,
come back with a warrant.

30:24.620 --> 30:26.440
Getting a warrant
won't be easy.

30:26.490 --> 30:28.458
Right now, all we know is that
some computers were stolen

30:28.490 --> 30:30.310
that may have some
of his files.

30:30.360 --> 30:31.520
That's pretty thin.

30:31.560 --> 30:33.027
We know one more
thing than that.

30:33.060 --> 30:34.391
We know that
at some p0Int at least,

30:34.430 --> 30:36.557
he owned a pair
of size-11 Luzzattos.

30:36.600 --> 30:38.568
He might have got rid
of them already,

30:38.600 --> 30:41.433
but, uh, his credit card
statements might help.
(cell phone chimes)

30:41.470 --> 30:44.439
I'll take this to the captain,
see what he thinks.

30:44.470 --> 30:46.438
My friend at
the Department of Buildings

30:46.470 --> 30:48.301
has important
information to share.
(elevator bell dIngs)

30:48.340 --> 30:49.876
Well, you go ahead.

30:49.910 --> 30:51.172
I've heard enough
about zoning laws

30:51.210 --> 30:52.199
to last a lifetime.

30:58.220 --> 30:59.517
(tapping on window)

31:05.130 --> 31:07.086
What are you doing here?

31:07.130 --> 31:11.089
Way to make a girl
feel welcome.

31:11.130 --> 31:13.098
I'm sorry,

31:13.130 --> 31:17.339
but this is literally the last
place I thought I'd see you.

31:19.710 --> 31:22.531
Do you want, uh...

31:22.580 --> 31:24.548
do you want some water
or coffee?

31:24.580 --> 31:27.071
I'm fine.

31:27.110 --> 31:28.611
Um...

31:28.650 --> 31:32.484
The other night,
I wasn't being honest with you.

31:34.120 --> 31:35.951
I told you I thought
my past could hurt you,

31:35.990 --> 31:37.287
but there's more
to it than that,

31:37.320 --> 31:38.628
and you deserve to hear it.

31:38.660 --> 31:40.150
Am I about to get

31:40.190 --> 31:42.954
the "It's not you,
it's me" speech?

31:44.170 --> 31:46.923
It is me.

31:49.270 --> 31:51.568
Your friend Joan
stopped by the shop, and...

31:51.610 --> 31:55.171
she knew I was hiding something.

31:58.580 --> 32:01.140
I have MS.

32:01.180 --> 32:04.183
I was diagnosed
two months ago,

32:04.220 --> 32:07.519
and I didn't know
how to tell you, so...

32:10.020 --> 32:12.659
I haven't been worried about
what I'll do to your career.

32:12.690 --> 32:14.351
I've been worried

32:14.400 --> 32:17.051
about what I'll do
to the rest of your life.

32:17.100 --> 32:20.092
Paige.

32:20.130 --> 32:22.439
It's very early.

32:23.570 --> 32:26.266
But so are we.

32:26.310 --> 32:31.338
Eventually, this disease
is gonna get ugly.

32:31.380 --> 32:34.474
And I was using the job
as an excuse because...

32:34.520 --> 32:37.318
you're a good man.

32:39.320 --> 32:43.051
And you don't deserve
to be stuck with what's coming.

32:48.260 --> 32:50.524
So...

32:50.560 --> 32:53.120
thatsit

32:53.170 --> 32:56.298
I don't get a say in this?

32:56.340 --> 32:58.604
No.

33:04.410 --> 33:07.743
Good-bye, Tommy.

33:14.390 --> 33:16.415
HOLMES:
Watson?!

33:20.290 --> 33:22.258
What's all this?

33:22.300 --> 33:24.063
Illumination, Watson.

33:24.100 --> 33:26.068
It is if you put it
in the fireplace.

33:26.100 --> 33:28.398
These materials represent

33:28.440 --> 33:30.795
a_fundamental _shift
In our perceptIon

33:30.840 --> 33:32.728
of the case.
So you got

33:32.770 --> 33:35.079
all this from your friend
at the Department of Buildings?

33:35.110 --> 33:37.237
Some of it.

33:37.280 --> 33:39.646
His important news was

33:39.680 --> 33:42.808
that William Hull put out
a press release earlier today.

33:42.850 --> 33:46.115
The magnate has got his wish.

33:46.150 --> 33:49.756
They found a way to move
forward with the project.

33:49.790 --> 33:51.781
How? They settled
the air rights problem?

33:51.830 --> 33:54.355
No. They went around it.

33:54.400 --> 33:57.494
Or, more accurately, under it.

33:57.530 --> 33:59.828
This is the image

33:59.870 --> 34:02.532
which accompanied
today's announcement.

34:09.110 --> 34:11.203
It's shorter.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.808
23 stories shorter.

34:12.850 --> 34:15.512
The original is 63,
this one is 40.

34:15.550 --> 34:17.074
So they used the air rights

34:17.120 --> 34:18.678
they could get
to build a shorter building,

34:18.720 --> 34:20.847
and they already
have completed plans?

34:20.890 --> 34:23.415
That seems fast.

34:27.590 --> 34:31.094
Wait. These are not plans
for the new building.

34:31.130 --> 34:35.863
These are plans for the building
Busquet's office is in.

34:35.900 --> 34:38.437
It's too early to have details
on the new design.

34:38.470 --> 34:40.859
The decision
is literally hours old.

34:40.910 --> 34:43.435
These, however,
were on file with the city,

34:43.480 --> 34:45.744
and my contact
graciously supplied them.

34:45.780 --> 34:47.748
These are the files

34:47.780 --> 34:50.271
that were leaked
to Derek O'Neal's office.

34:50.320 --> 34:51.639
So you got the plans

34:51.690 --> 34:53.248
to Busquet's building,
and used them

34:53.290 --> 34:54.587
to break into his office

34:54.620 --> 34:56.281
so that you could
resteal the plans

34:56.320 --> 34:57.582
to Hull's building
that were leaked.

34:57.620 --> 35:00.123
Succinctly put.

35:00.160 --> 35:01.798
You know you can't use
any of this as evidence.

35:01.830 --> 35:03.525
I know, but if I'm right,
I won't have to.

35:03.560 --> 35:04.868
Because?

35:04.900 --> 35:06.697
Theory of the crimes
has been wrong all along.

35:06.730 --> 35:08.436
We've been thinking

35:08.470 --> 35:10.665
that Derek O'Neal was killed
to protect the building

35:10.700 --> 35:12.839
and that Rosalyn Graham
was killed to block it.

35:12.870 --> 35:14.599
I now believe that both murders

35:14.640 --> 35:16.676
were the work
of the same killer,

35:16.710 --> 35:18.746
who intended to shrink it.

35:26.220 --> 35:27.812
(elevator bell dings)

35:27.850 --> 35:30.557
I was told the captain of
Major Crimes needed to see me.

35:30.590 --> 35:32.421
Yes, he's gonna join us
in a little while,

35:32.460 --> 35:34.291
but for now, we wanted
to keep things informal.

35:34.330 --> 35:36.150
Do I need an attorney present?

35:36.200 --> 35:38.293
Are you a criminal?

35:38.330 --> 35:39.729
You're hard to read.

35:39.770 --> 35:41.738
You'd make a good negotiator.

35:41.770 --> 35:43.397
You've got five minutes.

35:48.540 --> 35:52.169
You remember
the Mars Orbital mishap of 1999?

35:52.210 --> 35:53.848
Where the satellite
burned up

35:53.880 --> 35:56.178
upon contact
with the Martian atmosphere?

35:56.220 --> 35:58.484
Am I_somehow
responSIble for that?

35:58.520 --> 36:00.647
All caused by
a small mathematical error.

36:00.690 --> 36:02.487
One computer was using
American units,

36:02.520 --> 36:04.249
the rest were using metric.

36:04.290 --> 36:05.757
WATSON: The point is,
small miscalculations

36:05.790 --> 36:07.678
can have big consequences.

36:07.730 --> 36:09.220
In this case, two murders.

36:09.260 --> 36:10.898
Three, if you count Jason Leary,

36:10.930 --> 36:12.693
the man
that Rosalyn Graham fell on.

36:12.730 --> 36:14.834
An acquaintance of ours

36:14.870 --> 36:16.428
looked over the plans
for your building.

36:16.470 --> 36:18.961
He found that your architect,
Mr. Busquet--

36:19.010 --> 36:21.399
or, perhaps,
someone in his team--

36:21.440 --> 36:23.499
_ made an error _
In theIr WInd calculatIons.

36:23.540 --> 36:26.407
In short, at 63 stories,

36:26.450 --> 36:28.645
the building would've been
structurally unsound.

36:28.680 --> 36:31.285
Anything stronger
than a stiff breeze,

36:31.320 --> 36:32.844
and it would've come
tumbIIng down.

36:34.590 --> 36:36.979
And you're saying that you think
Busquet knew about this?

36:37.020 --> 36:38.658
WATSON: We think
he discovered the mistake,

36:38.690 --> 36:41.659
but by then, things were
too far along to pull the plug.

36:41.700 --> 36:45.568
And you yourself called
this building a "legacy maker."

36:45.600 --> 36:47.465
Busquet's been heaped
with praise,

36:47.500 --> 36:49.331
from which he's already lined up

36:49.370 --> 36:52.009
several more high-profile jobs:
Dubai, Tokyo, Sydney.

36:52.040 --> 36:53.735
WATSON: All of those
would've gone away

36:53.770 --> 36:55.271
if he'd come clean.

36:55.310 --> 36:56.709
So, instead, he found
a way to make sure

36:56.740 --> 36:58.298
the building could
only be 40 stories

36:58.350 --> 37:00.477
without reflecting poorly
on him.

37:00.510 --> 37:02.740
So he killed Rosalyn Graham
to tie up her estate--

37:02.780 --> 37:05.340
and air rights--
in legal battles.

37:05.390 --> 37:07.688
Derek O'Neal's murder
was likely not planned.

37:07.720 --> 37:09.813
The evidence suggests
that Busquet

37:09.860 --> 37:11.782
broke into the offices
of Save the West Side

37:11.830 --> 37:14.253
to retrieve the leaked
documents, lest his error

37:14.300 --> 37:15.824
be discovered one day.

37:15.860 --> 37:18.590
O'Neal walked in on that,
sealing his fate.

37:19.570 --> 37:22.289
I swear, I had no idea.

37:22.340 --> 37:23.534
HOLMES:
Yeah, well, your reputation

37:23.570 --> 37:25.435
for litigation precedes you.

37:25.470 --> 37:27.563
Had Busquet ever told you
about his cock-up,

37:27.610 --> 37:28.838
you'd have sued him blind.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.700
So then why I am I here?

37:30.740 --> 37:32.503
Why not just arrest Busquet?

37:32.550 --> 37:34.279
Because we need your help.

37:34.320 --> 37:36.049
WATSON:
The police have a sample

37:36.080 --> 37:37.513
of what we think
is the killer's blood.

37:37.550 --> 37:39.040
With a warrant,
we can compel Busquet

37:39.090 --> 37:40.944
to provide a DNA sample.

37:40.990 --> 37:43.288
The problem is, everything we
just told you was from us seeing

37:43.320 --> 37:45.925
a report that was
not acquired in a way

37:45.960 --> 37:47.689
that would stand up in court.

37:47.730 --> 37:49.857
That's why our captain
isn't in the room yet.

37:49.900 --> 37:51.049
HOLMES:
Now, from here,

37:51.100 --> 37:53.295
things can proceed in two ways.

37:53.330 --> 37:55.730
We could find another way
to arrest Busquet.

37:55.770 --> 37:57.965
And, I mean, you know us
well enough by now.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.558
We'd eventually
be able to do that.

37:59.610 --> 38:00.929
But in that scenario,

38:00.970 --> 38:02.733
who knows how the court
of public opinion

38:02.780 --> 38:04.372
_is going
to judge you?

38:04.410 --> 38:05.604
I mean, we don't think
you're involved.

38:05.650 --> 38:07.049
Press might see it differently.

38:07.080 --> 38:10.743
And in the other scenario?

38:10.780 --> 38:14.614
You "give" us all the materials
you see here before you,

38:14.660 --> 38:16.389
which, as the
property developer,

38:16.420 --> 38:17.887
you rightfully own.

38:17.920 --> 38:19.922
Then we invite the captain in,

38:19.960 --> 38:21.518
the police get
their search warrant

38:23.800 --> 38:25.688
Your building is gonna be
40 stories either way.

38:25.730 --> 38:27.891
This way,
you'll be the hero.

38:27.930 --> 38:29.932
HOLMES: I understand you're
considering running for office.

38:31.670 --> 38:34.537
So which scenario
do you think's better?

38:40.710 --> 38:42.541
Hi.

38:42.580 --> 38:43.945
Got my message.
Yeah.

38:43.980 --> 38:45.789
I'm guessing
it's not a coincidence

38:45.820 --> 38:47.378
you asked to meet at a place
across from Paige's shop.

38:47.420 --> 38:49.786
She told you
that I went to see her.

38:49.820 --> 38:51.082
Look”.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.519
No, no, no, no, no, no.
This isn't...

38:53.730 --> 38:55.049
It has nothing to do with that.

38:55.100 --> 38:56.522
Sit down.

38:56.560 --> 38:58.994
* Let 'em turn into a river

38:59.030 --> 39:01.863
* And carry you away...

39:01.900 --> 39:04.801
She's out getting her lunch,
but when she gets back,

39:04.840 --> 39:06.137
I'm gonna talk to her.

39:06.170 --> 39:08.104
But I wanted to
talk to you first.

39:08.140 --> 39:09.971
* Brother, don't be afraid...
Okay.

39:10.010 --> 39:12.478
She has MS.

39:12.510 --> 39:15.673
That's why she was
pushing me away.

39:17.150 --> 39:18.947
She wanted to...

39:18.990 --> 39:20.810
spare me.

39:20.850 --> 39:22.750
You know?

39:22.790 --> 39:25.156
It's early now,
but, you know.

39:25.190 --> 39:27.852
I've been reading up,
mostly on the Internet,

39:27.890 --> 39:29.858
about the timeline, uh,

39:29.900 --> 39:31.925
you know,
when things happen,

39:31.970 --> 39:34.632
how bad it gets, uh...

39:34.670 --> 39:37.093
It gets bad.

39:37.140 --> 39:39.938
* Let the silver voices
gUIde you... *

39:39.970 --> 39:41.801
My first thought--
and I mean my first thought--

39:41.840 --> 39:43.068
is "I don't care.

39:43.110 --> 39:44.702
I love her;
I want to be with her."

39:44.750 --> 39:47.173
Butthen".

39:47.210 --> 39:51.112
* Ooh ooh ooh-ooh ooh ooh...

39:51.150 --> 39:54.119
You know, I realize with
something like this, you know...

39:54.150 --> 39:56.050
This isn't like that.

39:56.090 --> 40:00.823
Doesn't count unless you go in
with your eyes wide open.

40:00.860 --> 40:03.624
So I wanted to

40:03.660 --> 40:05.924
talk through it first,
you know?

40:05.970 --> 40:07.665
With a...

40:07.700 --> 40:10.134
doctor. (chuckles)

40:10.170 --> 40:11.831
And a friend.

40:11.870 --> 40:14.134
See if there's, uh,

40:14.170 --> 40:17.503
anything this stuff
isn't telling me.

40:17.540 --> 40:20.839
Well, I doubt
there's anything I can tell you

40:20.880 --> 40:22.541
that you haven't already read.

40:22.580 --> 40:24.946
* Ti|| you reach
the other side... *

40:24.990 --> 40:27.641
MS. is... cruel.

40:27.690 --> 40:29.112
(exhales)

40:29.160 --> 40:32.027
The progression is gonna
be tough on her and you.

40:34.260 --> 40:36.922
It could take years...

40:36.960 --> 40:39.793
or months.

40:39.830 --> 40:42.537
And once the disease
really takes hold,

40:42.570 --> 40:44.538
she's gonna need a lot of help.

40:46.540 --> 40:47.962
Well...

40:48.010 --> 40:50.570
she's worth it.

40:50.610 --> 40:53.807
* Don't close your eyes...

40:53.850 --> 40:56.739
The one thing the literature
probably doesn't mention

40:56.780 --> 40:58.782
is that you're not gonna
go through it alone.

40:58.820 --> 41:01.789
Your friends are gonna
be there for you.

41:01.820 --> 41:03.981
* I'm here in the fire...

41:04.020 --> 41:05.829
Mmm.

41:05.860 --> 41:07.748
* Like a match to the sky...

41:07.790 --> 41:09.155
GREGSON:
Oh. She's back early.

41:09.200 --> 41:11.623
* Lightin' up the night
for you... *

41:11.670 --> 41:12.819
Oh...

41:13.930 --> 41:17.093
Well, wish me luck.

41:17.140 --> 41:20.109
* Ooh ooh ooh-ooh ooh ooh...

41:20.140 --> 41:22.233
All of it.

41:22.280 --> 41:25.807
* Ooh ooh ooh-ooh ooh ooh

41:25.850 --> 41:29.115
* I'll see you
on the other side *

41:29.150 --> 41:32.085
* Ooh ooh-ooh ooh ooh ooh

41:32.120 --> 41:34.680
* I'll see you
on the other side *

41:34.720 --> 41:38.952
* Ooh ooh ooh-ooh ooh ooh ooh

41:38.990 --> 41:42.551
* Ooh ooh ooh-ooh ooh ooh

41:42.600 --> 41:44.818
* I'll see you
on the other side *

41:44.870 --> 41:46.826
* Ooh ooh ooh-ooh ooh ooh ooh

41:46.870 --> 41:48.735
* I'll see you
on the other side... *
