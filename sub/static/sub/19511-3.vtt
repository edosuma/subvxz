00:02.933 --> 00:04.167
Previously on "The Breaks"...

00:04.233 --> 00:05.933
Give me the tape.
I don't have it on me.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.700
You got DeeVee's tape?
Sorry, sis.

00:07.767 --> 00:10.200
My dumbass cousin
got it stolen in Jersey.

00:10.267 --> 00:12.233
Got your tape here.

00:12.300 --> 00:14.333
I'm not going to South Carolina.
Yes, you are.

00:14.400 --> 00:16.167
And you gonna get away
from this Ahm nigga.

00:16.233 --> 00:18.600
Geronimo's crew caught Bug
over there by Kennedy.

00:18.667 --> 00:20.567
They chopped the nigga up.

00:21.933 --> 00:23.000
This is for you.

00:23.067 --> 00:26.300
I'm sorry
about your loss.

00:26.367 --> 00:29.733
What do you say you and me,
we get out in front of this?

00:29.800 --> 00:31.333
Never in a million years.

00:31.400 --> 00:33.100
What are you gonna tell Mattie
Taylor when you find her?

00:33.167 --> 00:34.600
I'm gonna tell her
the time is nigh

00:34.667 --> 00:36.067
to get with Fouray Records,
we about to blow up.

00:36.133 --> 00:37.567
You know, you're too good.

00:37.633 --> 00:39.600
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

00:39.667 --> 00:41.200
It's sweet.

00:41.267 --> 00:44.800
I'm sorry, David, but I need you
to put your shirt back on.

01:21.700 --> 01:23.633
Okay, so it's really over?

01:23.700 --> 01:25.100
Yeah.

01:25.167 --> 01:27.200
I don't understand.
You guys were so good together.

01:27.267 --> 01:28.467
We were.

01:28.533 --> 01:30.100
And I mean,
don't get me wrong.

01:30.167 --> 01:32.333
He's still great
and I still love him.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.500
It's just, I can't move

01:34.567 --> 01:36.667
the way I want to move with
David right now.

01:36.733 --> 01:38.800
You know, he's...

01:38.867 --> 01:41.767
What?

01:41.833 --> 01:42.800
Sweet.

01:42.867 --> 01:44.867
Y'all broke up because
he's sweet?

01:44.933 --> 01:46.133
Sweet.

01:46.200 --> 01:49.067
Good. Patient.
You know.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.600
I don't know.

01:50.667 --> 01:52.833
If we'd have stayed together,

01:52.900 --> 01:56.067
I'd just end up hurting him
even more than I already did.

01:56.133 --> 01:57.367
I understand.

01:57.433 --> 01:59.167
Of course you do.
We're the same.

01:59.233 --> 02:00.500
Not exactly.

02:00.567 --> 02:03.800
And not since, you know...

02:03.867 --> 02:05.700
So, what, you're not
hungry anymore?

02:05.767 --> 02:06.933
I am.

02:07.067 --> 02:09.400
And in certain ways,
I'm hungrier,

02:09.467 --> 02:10.900
but other things matter now.

02:10.967 --> 02:13.433
And I have to take her
to the park sometimes.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.867
I get it.
I know you get it.

02:15.933 --> 02:17.733
That's why you said
what you said.

02:17.800 --> 02:20.100
Damita, you cannot keep
lording that over me.

02:20.167 --> 02:21.400
You asked my opinion, so--

02:21.467 --> 02:22.800
And you gave it
and it's fine.

02:22.867 --> 02:24.600
I just never understood
why you disappeared

02:24.667 --> 02:26.200
when I decided to keep her.

02:26.267 --> 02:28.567
You moved!
Come on, Nikki.

02:28.633 --> 02:30.567
How many times are you
gonna make me apologize?

02:30.633 --> 02:33.600
Damita, where you put
Lucinda's sandals?

02:33.667 --> 02:36.067
By the library books.

02:37.067 --> 02:39.433
You're right.
My bad.

02:39.500 --> 02:41.133
I can't find them.

03:25.767 --> 03:27.467
Imani X is dope right?

03:27.533 --> 03:28.933
Yeah, yeah.

03:29.067 --> 03:30.633
I just got my hands
on her demo.

03:30.700 --> 03:32.533
I want Barry to sign her.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.933
There's, like,
150 tapes on his desk,

03:35.067 --> 03:37.467
but Imani X, she's the one.

03:42.067 --> 03:44.633
I still can't believe that
you got another job.

03:44.700 --> 03:48.200
At another
black radio station.

03:48.267 --> 03:52.067
You sure Juggy doesn't have
anything to do with this?

03:52.133 --> 03:54.767
Why you gotta
fuck up my morning?

03:54.833 --> 03:57.100
Yo, I'm kidding,
I'm kidding, okay?

03:57.167 --> 03:58.533
Don't be so sensitive.

03:58.600 --> 04:00.933
It's a fresh start without
Juggy's initials.
Okay.

04:01.067 --> 04:05.300
I actually get to program
a couple tracks and...

04:05.367 --> 04:07.567
You believe me?

04:07.633 --> 04:09.733
I have to, okay?

04:09.800 --> 04:11.733
My dad's on my ass.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.300
Ahm's on my ass.

04:13.367 --> 04:15.633
Shit, I don't even have
a place to stay.

04:15.700 --> 04:17.733
Crash at my place.

04:17.800 --> 04:21.367
You can't put out new music
if you're in hiding.

04:23.500 --> 04:25.100
You sure?

04:25.167 --> 04:27.067
It's cool.

04:29.667 --> 04:31.167
It's all good, man.

04:31.233 --> 04:33.733
I got a couple passes to
the New Music Seminar.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.400
Why don't you come down
and meet 'em?

04:35.467 --> 04:37.800
Why?
I don't have a demo.

04:37.867 --> 04:40.800
And Ahm won't let
anybody hear the stuff
that we're doing, so...

04:40.867 --> 04:43.333
You never know
what's gonna happen.

04:43.400 --> 04:46.500
You can split tomorrow.

04:46.567 --> 04:48.067
Okay.

04:48.067 --> 04:49.967
There's gonna be
girls there, right?

04:50.067 --> 04:52.100
Hell yes, there's gonna
be girls there.

04:54.567 --> 04:55.867
Gotta go.

04:55.933 --> 04:57.900
Where?
To the job, Mama.

04:57.967 --> 05:00.367
What job?
This your job.

05:00.433 --> 05:02.067
You supposed to be here.

05:02.133 --> 05:04.967
Your father can't be here,
so he needs you to be.

05:05.067 --> 05:06.833
Look, Ma, I know.
Yeah, you know?

05:06.900 --> 05:08.867
Then why you leave?

05:30.233 --> 05:31.800
You fuckin' with me
today, right?

05:31.867 --> 05:33.200
Actually, no.

05:33.267 --> 05:34.900
I'm Nikki Jones,
I'm with Fouray Management.

05:34.967 --> 05:36.400
I heard your demo,

05:36.467 --> 05:39.200
and I'd like to talk to you
about joining Fouray.

05:39.267 --> 05:42.367
Look, you can't be in line
if you ain't buying nothing.

05:42.433 --> 05:46.867
Okay, let me get a pack of
sour apple Now and Laters.

05:46.933 --> 05:49.400
25 cents.
I think you're dope.

05:49.467 --> 05:51.400
We could help you get
a recording contract,

05:51.467 --> 05:53.267
get you in the studio.

05:55.067 --> 05:56.267
25 cents.

05:56.333 --> 05:58.267
Everyone's crazy over
Ill Jake's album.

05:58.333 --> 06:00.300
He just got a new record deal,
but you don't got shit.

06:00.367 --> 06:02.633
And your point is?
You wrote "Spit Take."

06:02.700 --> 06:05.367
That's the joint that got him
picked up by Atlantic.

06:05.433 --> 06:09.100
Look, I'd love to introduce you
to Barry Fouray.

06:09.167 --> 06:12.233
He's speaking on a panel at
the New Music Seminar today.

06:12.300 --> 06:14.267
I'll leave two passes
at the door.

06:20.500 --> 06:22.067
25 cents.

06:25.933 --> 06:27.800
You're better than this.

06:38.533 --> 06:40.500
Yo, everybody is up in here.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.233
Yeah.

06:42.300 --> 06:43.533
Yes, they are.

06:43.600 --> 06:44.767
Hey, Mama.
What's up?

06:44.833 --> 06:46.400
Hey, are you in
the DJ battle?

06:46.467 --> 06:48.233
I'm covering it.

06:48.300 --> 06:49.767
Yeah, yeah, I am.

06:49.833 --> 06:51.533
Cool. The lyric, right?

06:51.600 --> 06:52.900
I'll try and stop by later.

06:52.967 --> 06:55.467
Okay.
Bye.

06:55.533 --> 06:56.867
So...

06:56.933 --> 07:00.267
since when were you selected
for the DJ battle?

07:00.333 --> 07:03.600
Since just now.

07:03.667 --> 07:08.533
And how exactly do you plan on
getting into the DJ battle?

07:08.600 --> 07:10.467
I have no fuckin' idea.

07:10.533 --> 07:11.933
Holy shit!

07:13.633 --> 07:15.967
Dude, is that Lynch Mob?
Come on!

07:16.067 --> 07:17.900
No, bro, I'm--
I'm black.

07:17.967 --> 07:20.233
I don't run toward shit, no.

07:20.300 --> 07:23.300
I was gonna be
in the DJ battle!

07:36.800 --> 07:41.067
My son's name was
Wayne Louis Calder.

07:41.133 --> 07:44.400
He was born
February 14th, 1975,

07:44.467 --> 07:46.800
at Brooklyn Hospital
right up the street.

07:46.867 --> 07:49.100
5:36 p.m.

07:49.167 --> 07:53.133
My husband had to work,
so he couldn't be there.

07:53.200 --> 07:55.067
But my cousin Melba,
she came with me.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.633
She held my hand
the whole time.

07:57.700 --> 07:59.867
What you want, lady?

08:00.067 --> 08:02.933
He didn't cry too much
when he came into the world.

08:03.067 --> 08:06.667
He just laid on my belly
with his eyes open.

08:06.733 --> 08:10.167
I don't want
your money.

08:13.533 --> 08:15.267
Let's go.

08:18.767 --> 08:21.333
He was my only child.

08:46.600 --> 08:47.733
New Music Seminar's kinda cool.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.667
What they got,
like, new carpet

08:49.733 --> 08:51.067
or something in
since last year?

08:51.133 --> 08:52.133
You remember?

08:52.200 --> 08:53.467
It's the same carpet, Barry.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.967
The sign-in table moved.

08:55.067 --> 08:56.367
Mm, you got
a good eye.

08:56.433 --> 08:57.700
You have a good memory.

08:57.767 --> 08:59.133
Ha.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.400
I think Imani X should
audition for the label.

09:01.467 --> 09:04.167
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but listen,
this is the setup,

09:04.233 --> 09:07.200
and I need you to pay attention,
because it's all here--

09:07.267 --> 09:10.167
the money, the distribution,
the talent.

09:10.233 --> 09:11.633
And look, look.

09:11.700 --> 09:14.400
That's Harvey Rosen right there,
from Landmark Distribution.

09:14.467 --> 09:15.967
Only thing about them
is we would have to

09:16.067 --> 09:17.767
put up all of
the production costs.

09:17.833 --> 09:18.900
Ah, the queen!

09:18.967 --> 09:20.600
Uh, excuse me,
Miss Taylor!

09:20.667 --> 09:22.833
I thought-- I thought we was
gonna have that sit-down.

09:22.900 --> 09:24.433
Yeah, we are, we are.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.333
Things have just been a little
crazy with the transition,

09:26.400 --> 09:28.467
so make sure Nikki talks
to my assistant.

09:28.533 --> 09:30.500
We'll get her on the books
for next week.

10:08.367 --> 10:09.500
Cheryl.

10:09.567 --> 10:10.867
Hey, darlin'.

10:10.933 --> 10:14.200
Tell Horace
Juggy's on the line, will you?

10:18.100 --> 10:21.467
Horace, what's shakin', baby?

10:21.533 --> 10:24.033
Listen, I want
to talk to you

10:24.100 --> 10:27.100
about this new
Keith Sweat record.

10:31.400 --> 10:33.967
That's why I don't care
if he breach his contract.

10:34.033 --> 10:35.533
If Tommy Boy
doesn't drop D Bone,

10:35.600 --> 10:36.700
who's gonna be
our first artist?

10:36.767 --> 10:37.800
We're about to find out.

10:37.867 --> 10:39.767
All right, listen up!

10:39.833 --> 10:41.400
I got a new label

10:41.467 --> 10:44.567
and we holding auditions here
later on today!

10:44.633 --> 10:46.300
I'm looking for a star.

10:46.367 --> 10:48.500
Who got the hot shit?
Bring it?

10:48.567 --> 10:50.300
Here, right here!

10:51.600 --> 10:53.833
Right here.
Give it to him.

10:53.900 --> 10:55.133
All right, ladies,

10:55.200 --> 10:57.067
we got our distinguished
panel of judges here.

10:57.133 --> 11:00.367
It's gonna be a straight vote,
no ties, no tiebreaker.

11:00.433 --> 11:03.067
We gonna have fun, we gonna
keep it entertaining,

11:03.133 --> 11:05.767
and I don't want
to see your ass this year.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.700
Nah, don't worry,
I got something better.

11:07.767 --> 11:09.933
Look, the winner's
gonna get 500,

11:10.067 --> 11:11.633
a fresh ashtray
of techniques,

11:11.700 --> 11:13.600
and of course--
Ha ha ha!

11:13.667 --> 11:15.067
Yeah.

11:15.067 --> 11:16.600
This is what it's
all about right here.

11:16.667 --> 11:18.333
Right?

11:18.400 --> 11:22.367
Y'all go get ready,
man, act like y'all
want this, okay?

11:23.900 --> 11:26.200
Hey. Um... you know,
I was gonna ask you

11:26.267 --> 11:28.567
if I could be a last-minute
substitute for Prince Sid.

11:28.633 --> 11:29.800
He kinda got caught up

11:29.867 --> 11:32.067
in that squabble out there
with Lynch Mob.

11:32.133 --> 11:33.700
All right,
you in, man.

11:33.767 --> 11:35.100
Word?
Yeah, just--

11:35.167 --> 11:37.433
Just go set your crates up
right over there.

11:37.500 --> 11:39.767
Uh, you know what?
About my crates, I--

11:39.833 --> 11:41.800
Whatever, man,
you can just use mine.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.167
All right?
Yeah.

11:43.233 --> 11:44.200
Thank you.
Whatever, carry on.

11:44.267 --> 11:46.500
Pop-rap ain't the problem.

11:46.567 --> 11:47.733
I like pop.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.233
It's short for popular.

11:50.767 --> 11:52.233
The problem is that hip-hop,

11:52.300 --> 11:54.433
it don't get the chance
to become popular

11:54.500 --> 11:57.100
because the radio, the radio
wants to keep it safe

11:57.167 --> 11:58.667
and make a little bit of money
doing it,

11:58.733 --> 12:00.100
you know what I'm saying?

12:00.167 --> 12:03.067
So the radio will play
Young MC

12:03.067 --> 12:05.133
and not play Public Enemy?

12:05.200 --> 12:09.100
And I don't even mean that
as a disrespect to Young MC.

12:09.167 --> 12:12.067
I'm just saying,
there's room for Hammer

12:12.067 --> 12:14.567
and there's room
for Rakim, the God.

12:17.233 --> 12:20.600
Mrs. Taylor, do you have
something to say?

12:20.667 --> 12:24.933
Radio's looking for songs
that have melody.

12:25.067 --> 12:28.733
Now, rap music is only just
beginning

12:28.800 --> 12:30.467
to mature and understand that.

12:30.533 --> 12:31.700
What?

12:31.767 --> 12:33.367
People don't just
want to hear beats.

12:33.433 --> 12:35.467
They want to hear singing,
they want beautiful music.

12:35.533 --> 12:39.367
We at EBJ Music truly
believe in the future of rap,

12:39.433 --> 12:42.067
and we're gonna be looking for
rap that has balance.

12:42.100 --> 12:45.133
C+C Music Factory is a great
example of that,

12:45.200 --> 12:48.067
both melody and rap...

12:49.233 --> 12:51.400
Hey. I'm glad
you could make it.
Hey.

12:51.467 --> 12:52.967
So after this, I'm gonna
take you upstairs

12:53.067 --> 12:54.800
so you can audition
for Barry.

12:54.867 --> 12:57.067
Audition?
Well, it--

12:57.100 --> 12:59.233
How much
you paying her?

12:59.300 --> 13:01.400
This my mom.
Her manager.

13:01.467 --> 13:03.267
Nikki Jones,
Fouray Records,

13:03.333 --> 13:05.867
and it's not a gig,
it's an opportunity.

13:05.933 --> 13:08.067
I'd like Barry to hear
what Imani X can do.

13:08.100 --> 13:09.833
I think you'll kill it.

13:09.900 --> 13:12.400
I got all the respect in
the world for my sister here,

13:12.467 --> 13:16.367
but this is an old
person's view of what
music is supposed to be.

13:16.433 --> 13:19.100
I've been in this business long
enough to know what sells,

13:19.167 --> 13:21.600
and I also understand that music
is always changing.

13:21.667 --> 13:23.600
Then you can't-- You can't--
You can't tell me that--

13:23.667 --> 13:26.833
EBJ Music is looking forward
to progressing with rap music.

13:26.900 --> 13:29.233
You can't tell me that
"Humpty Dance" ain't as catchy
as "You Can't Touch This."

13:29.300 --> 13:30.633
But it's more than
just being catchy.

13:30.700 --> 13:32.167
It's more than just
being catchy.

13:32.233 --> 13:34.333
Hey, can you cover me
for a few?

13:34.400 --> 13:36.133
...and NWA don't
make great songs...

13:36.200 --> 13:37.600
...has a melody,
that has a message...

13:37.667 --> 13:40.300
...that aren't more than
catchy and have messages.

13:40.367 --> 13:41.400
I don't think so.

13:41.467 --> 13:42.933
Public Enemy
don't have a message?

13:43.067 --> 13:44.467
Well, but we want--

13:44.533 --> 13:46.300
Public Enemy don't
have a message.
We want melody.

14:15.700 --> 14:20.400
Yo, man, we found that
motherfucker that killed Bug.

14:20.467 --> 14:21.633
Yo!

14:21.700 --> 14:24.833
Yo, Ahm, man.

14:24.900 --> 14:27.067
Look, man,
this is Bug's--

14:30.267 --> 14:33.200
Look, man, stop tripping
over that woman, a'ight?

14:33.267 --> 14:35.600
If she ain't want it,
she ain't want it.

14:35.667 --> 14:38.733
I mean, if you really wanna
do something for her,

14:38.800 --> 14:42.133
That motherfucker's
staying at his girl's crib
up in Crown Heights.

14:42.200 --> 14:45.500
We got eyes on him.

14:54.867 --> 14:56.200
Okay.

14:56.267 --> 14:58.400
It's time to open it to
the audience for questions.

14:58.467 --> 15:00.100
Uh...

15:00.167 --> 15:01.433
The young lady
in the yellow shirt.

15:06.567 --> 15:08.633
I got a question for Barry.

15:10.767 --> 15:16.533
I wanna know how you use a coke
habit as an artist's expense.

15:16.600 --> 15:17.667
Yo...

15:17.733 --> 15:19.167
Creative accounting
or something, what?

15:19.233 --> 15:20.733
This cornfed motherfucker
used to work with me

15:20.800 --> 15:24.067
until I fired his ass for
pocketing artists' money.

15:24.100 --> 15:26.500
Brother, you don't have
no money to steal.

15:26.567 --> 15:29.933
Huh? Yo, this man ain't got
no distribution, people,

15:30.067 --> 15:31.433
you know what I'm saying?

15:31.500 --> 15:33.800
If you tell the folks that you
giving them a record deal...

15:33.867 --> 15:35.600
You talking, but what--

15:35.667 --> 15:38.167
You first ought to make sure
that you to enough wax
in your store, right?

15:38.233 --> 15:39.300
What have you
ever started?

15:39.367 --> 15:40.633
Nothing!
You a leech, boss!

15:40.700 --> 15:42.200
You don't know nothing
about being no--

15:42.267 --> 15:44.800
Hey, hey, look, your boy--
You stepping up?

15:45.933 --> 15:47.600
You won't be nothing
without me!

15:47.667 --> 15:49.067
You wanna step up?

15:49.067 --> 15:50.367
I'm the cat who helped you
start this thing!

15:50.433 --> 15:52.500
You a sucker, you gonna
always be a sucker.

15:52.567 --> 15:54.833
I knew that nigga Fouray
wasn't shit.

15:54.900 --> 15:56.300
Come on, let's go.

15:56.367 --> 15:58.133
I'm so scared.
Yeah, I want you to be.

15:58.200 --> 15:59.833
Be very scared.
Ooh, I'm scared!

15:59.900 --> 16:01.600
Get outta here,
you a sucker!

16:03.300 --> 16:05.467
My mom got called
into work last minute.

16:05.533 --> 16:06.433
Okay.

16:06.500 --> 16:09.133
I gotta go catch Imani.

16:12.167 --> 16:15.733
Imani X!
Mrs. Williams!

16:15.800 --> 16:18.500
Please! Please! I...

16:18.567 --> 16:19.667
Tell me.

16:19.733 --> 16:22.100
How is that man
gonna manage Imani

16:22.167 --> 16:25.167
when he can't even manage
his own God damn self, huh?

16:25.233 --> 16:26.733
I am sorry for all the drama.

16:26.800 --> 16:28.500
Gordie is Barry's closest
childhood friend.

16:28.567 --> 16:29.967
You know how those things
can turn ugly.

16:30.067 --> 16:33.133
And what exactly is Fouray
gonna do for my baby?

16:33.200 --> 16:35.100
He's gonna
make her a star.

16:35.167 --> 16:36.700
So why do
I have to audition?

16:36.767 --> 16:38.700
Please, believe me,

16:38.767 --> 16:41.733
the auditions are just
a formality, trust me.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.067
Let's just do it.

16:46.067 --> 16:47.833
I already took
the whole day off anyway.

16:47.900 --> 16:51.067
In that nasty-ass
Army surplus shit?

16:51.133 --> 16:53.400
Ain't nobody at war.

16:53.467 --> 16:55.267
Ma, why you tripping?

16:55.333 --> 16:57.567
Because, we trying
to get you a deal,

16:57.633 --> 16:58.867
and you running around here

16:58.933 --> 17:00.767
looking like a raggedy-ass
little boy.

17:00.833 --> 17:02.067
Oh, hey, girl.
Hey.

17:02.133 --> 17:03.567
Just wanted
to let you know

17:03.633 --> 17:05.067
that the article on Barry
got approved.

17:05.133 --> 17:06.567
Dope, that's great news.

17:06.633 --> 17:08.100
Hey, can you help me out
with something?

17:08.167 --> 17:10.833
I need a few seconds
with Imani.

17:10.900 --> 17:12.067
Got it.
Thanks.

17:12.067 --> 17:13.067
Here, take the baby.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.467
I'll get her
from you later.

17:16.533 --> 17:18.833
You have a cheetah dress
on right now, Mom?
You feelin' it?

17:18.900 --> 17:20.133
I do?
Hey.

17:20.200 --> 17:21.500
You have
a cheetah dress.

17:21.567 --> 17:22.833
I'm Damita Alonzo from
the "Village Voice."

17:22.900 --> 17:24.333
I'd like to get a few quotes
for a piece

17:24.400 --> 17:26.333
I'm working on
about artist management.

17:26.400 --> 17:28.267
Sure.
Yeah? Great, thanks.

17:28.333 --> 17:30.300
I'll get you.

17:30.367 --> 17:33.800
What magazine did you say
you worked for?

17:33.867 --> 17:35.233
Sorry about your mom.

17:35.300 --> 17:37.733
It's not your fault.
Whose kid?

17:37.800 --> 17:39.167
Not mine.

17:39.233 --> 17:41.767
Hey, I think Barry will
be ready for you in a sec.

17:41.833 --> 17:43.200
I'll go check.

17:43.267 --> 17:45.567
Come on.
Come on.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.367
Who left this beautiful child
with you?

17:49.433 --> 17:52.167
Whoa! Okay--

17:52.233 --> 17:53.933
Okay, but whose baby is this?

17:54.067 --> 17:56.300
All right!

17:56.367 --> 18:00.433
Let's get the party started!

18:00.500 --> 18:02.200
No, no, no.
It's all right.

18:02.267 --> 18:04.167
Yo, let--
let me see what you got.

18:41.667 --> 18:43.933
Okay, you nice with yours,
kid, for sure.

18:44.067 --> 18:46.900
You got flow.
Keep-- Keep doing your thing.

18:46.967 --> 18:48.333
Who's next, though?

18:48.400 --> 18:49.600
I need next.
Next, next.

19:21.067 --> 19:22.833
All flash.

19:48.867 --> 19:49.633
Oh, no, he did not.

19:53.567 --> 19:55.100
What is that,
a baby's arm?

19:56.533 --> 19:57.833
Yo, man,
what is wrong with you?

20:01.067 --> 20:03.067
Man, he gets good
traction with that thing.

20:03.133 --> 20:05.033
What a dick move.

20:06.600 --> 20:09.167
Make some noise for
DJ Breakmaster G, y'all!

20:11.533 --> 20:12.767
Yo, you still go by
the name DJ DeeVee?

20:12.833 --> 20:14.733
Nah, it's just DeeVee.
Okay.

20:14.800 --> 20:17.433
Make some noise for our
challenger, DeeVee, y'all!

20:20.033 --> 20:21.433
DeeVee, where you from?

20:21.500 --> 20:23.300
From Queens!

20:26.400 --> 20:29.000
It's on you, Queens.

20:32.300 --> 20:34.633
I don't know
his fucking crates!

20:34.700 --> 20:36.600
I should have known
you was gonna choke.

20:36.667 --> 20:38.967
Yo, this sucker's
from Queens.

20:40.300 --> 20:41.567
Yo, is Brooklyn
in the house?

20:42.733 --> 20:44.933
Fuck that guy.
Don't listen to him.

20:47.900 --> 20:50.000
Actually,
I think I will.

20:50.067 --> 20:51.933
Fuckin' hypocrite.

20:53.533 --> 20:55.500
What's up?
See what Queens about.

22:15.633 --> 22:18.433
All right.
Wow, okay, okay.

22:18.500 --> 22:21.167
Let's go to the judges
and see who won that round.

22:27.267 --> 22:29.700
DeeVee!

22:31.067 --> 22:33.533
Make some noise
for DeeVee, y'all!

22:37.367 --> 22:39.067
My man Yapmaster B.L.

22:39.067 --> 22:40.867
is in central booking
right now, right?

22:40.933 --> 22:44.467
So I'm gonna do his part
and I'm gonna do my part, right?

22:46.633 --> 22:47.967
Check it out.

23:04.733 --> 23:06.333
Yo...

23:08.100 --> 23:09.800
Time out, time out, time out,
yo, time out, time out.

23:09.867 --> 23:11.700
Do you know what year
it is, man?

23:11.767 --> 23:13.633
It's 1990.
Are you sure?

23:13.700 --> 23:16.333
Do you know that
for a fact?

23:16.400 --> 23:18.067
You looking real fam--

23:18.100 --> 23:19.467
Yo...

23:19.533 --> 23:20.633
Yo, Ponds,
that's the motherfucker

23:20.700 --> 23:22.133
who's bootlegging
our shit!

23:22.200 --> 23:23.067
Oh! I recognize you!

23:23.100 --> 23:24.667
Get him, grab him, Ponds!

23:28.767 --> 23:30.833
What now, Juggy?

23:30.900 --> 23:32.067
I know you're very busy

23:32.133 --> 23:34.967
with the new job
and the fancy title,

23:35.067 --> 23:40.133
so I reached out to some old
friends from back in the day

23:40.200 --> 23:44.600
and I have secured for you
about a dozen or so stations

23:44.667 --> 23:46.900
that are just
chomping at the bit

23:46.967 --> 23:49.367
to put Keith Sweat's
new single

23:49.433 --> 23:51.567
into their rotations.

23:52.767 --> 23:55.533
Why would you do that?
You don't work at EBJ.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.500
You don't work anywhere,
for that matter.

23:59.300 --> 24:00.933
I just-- I...

24:03.067 --> 24:04.900
I want to see you
succeed.

24:04.967 --> 24:06.167
Mm-hmm.

24:08.067 --> 24:09.167
Hmm.

24:09.233 --> 24:11.233
You know, sometimes...

24:11.300 --> 24:14.200
a good word from an old pal
can go a long way.

24:15.900 --> 24:18.833
It certainly can't hurt to have
"I'll Give All my Love to You"

24:18.900 --> 24:22.400
playing in three
major Midwest markets.

24:22.467 --> 24:24.533
Well, I'm sorry,
did I overstep?

24:25.933 --> 24:27.100
You want me
to call 'em all back

24:27.167 --> 24:30.067
and tell 'em it's a no-go?

24:48.600 --> 24:49.967
Sashay!

24:50.067 --> 24:52.167
All right, we not looking
for the next Clan.

24:52.233 --> 24:53.733
Say, my brother...

24:53.800 --> 24:55.900
who's distributing this
so-called label?

24:55.967 --> 24:57.800
Okay, I can't deal
with this shit.

24:57.867 --> 24:59.833
I'm out, all right?
Move.

24:59.900 --> 25:01.500
The revolution
ain't gonna televised,

25:01.567 --> 25:02.933
Fuckin' around
with y'all clowns.
Imani X is ready.

25:03.067 --> 25:04.567
Well, you tell her
to leave her demo.

25:04.633 --> 25:05.967
But she's been waiting for--
I don't care!

25:06.067 --> 25:08.400
What'd I say?
She can wait forever!

25:19.833 --> 25:21.867
Yo, J, what's up?

25:23.100 --> 25:25.067
What you doing here,
Tiffany?

25:25.067 --> 25:27.267
Ain't nobody interested
in that lame flow.

25:27.333 --> 25:28.733
Boy, what?

25:28.800 --> 25:30.067
I'm the reason why people
checking for you now.

25:30.067 --> 25:33.500
If you're the reason
I got this deal,

25:33.567 --> 25:36.100
then how come you don't
have a deal at all?

25:36.167 --> 25:37.733
Riddle me that.

25:44.300 --> 25:46.867
There you are.
Is Barry ready for me?

25:46.933 --> 25:48.467
Well, not exactly.

25:48.533 --> 25:50.967
Barry just got called into
an important emergency meeting,

25:51.067 --> 25:52.933
but he's promised
to listen to your demo--
I knew it.

25:53.067 --> 25:54.633
He promised me--
Look, I-- I knew.

25:54.700 --> 25:56.467
I told you, baby.

25:56.533 --> 25:57.867
This bitch ain't shit.

25:57.933 --> 25:59.700
I-- I--
Just like her boss.

25:59.767 --> 26:01.200
Let's go.

26:28.733 --> 26:30.700
Yo, why is you
sweating me, man?

26:30.767 --> 26:31.867
You buy something
or not?

26:31.933 --> 26:33.067
Ma, Ma, I got it.

26:43.133 --> 26:45.400
You're Jamil's
little brother, yeah?

26:45.467 --> 26:47.067
Tell him what's up.

26:50.667 --> 26:52.167
He's a good kid.

26:52.233 --> 26:54.133
Good at stealing.

26:54.200 --> 26:56.400
The store's dead.
I've got a gig.

26:56.467 --> 26:57.667
And you leave me here?

26:57.733 --> 27:00.733
My other job
is important, too, Oma.

27:02.933 --> 27:05.233
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay, okay.

27:05.300 --> 27:07.833
This is what it's about
right now.

27:07.900 --> 27:09.833
The big show.

27:09.900 --> 27:12.133
The final round.

27:12.200 --> 27:14.533
Can you fuckin' believe
you made it this far?

27:14.600 --> 27:15.867
It's fuckin' crazy.

27:15.933 --> 27:17.167
I know, crazy.

27:17.233 --> 27:20.533
You really want
to leave all this?

27:20.600 --> 27:22.167
Man, I don't know.

27:22.233 --> 27:24.867
Okay. We'll send you
off right.

27:24.933 --> 27:27.833
Up first is my man
DJ Steve T, y'all!

27:58.400 --> 28:01.800
Hey, there's an orange record
back there, all right?

28:01.867 --> 28:04.367
With a fist on it.
Get me that.

28:17.600 --> 28:19.400
Look at you. Huh?

28:29.900 --> 28:31.833
I can't believe
I missed everything.

28:31.900 --> 28:33.067
Where were you?

28:33.067 --> 28:34.067
Where do you think?

28:34.067 --> 28:35.333
You don't get
a day off?

28:35.400 --> 28:36.900
My dad had a stroke.

28:36.967 --> 28:38.500
Oh, my God,
I'm so sorry.

28:38.567 --> 28:40.067
It's fine, it was last year,

28:40.067 --> 28:42.733
but he still can't work,
so they expect me to.

28:42.800 --> 28:44.400
So that's why
you're always late.

28:44.467 --> 28:45.600
Yeah.

28:45.667 --> 28:47.700
And here I thought
you was just on C.P. time.

28:50.400 --> 28:53.067
Yo, Imani X is battling
Ill Jake in the lobby.

28:54.967 --> 28:57.633
You gonna fall asleep.

28:57.700 --> 29:00.733
Uh...
Tamika, right?

29:00.800 --> 29:02.300
Yes?

29:02.367 --> 29:04.900
What-- this
your baby?

29:04.967 --> 29:06.500
Yes.

29:06.567 --> 29:08.633
Hi. Thank you.

29:08.700 --> 29:09.967
And don't forget
her bunny.

29:10.067 --> 29:12.067
Hi. Oh. Hi...

29:48.833 --> 29:50.867
Yeah.

29:50.933 --> 29:53.667
And you can take that back
to the boys' bathroom, Imani.

29:58.700 --> 29:59.833
Okay, all right.

29:59.900 --> 30:01.167
That was cute for you.

30:01.233 --> 30:02.800
He clearly doesn't
get any pussy.

30:02.867 --> 30:03.800
We get it.

30:55.133 --> 30:56.200
That's my star.

31:04.800 --> 31:06.067
Yeah!

31:13.067 --> 31:14.133
Hey!

31:14.200 --> 31:15.133
Hey yourself,
culture vulture.

31:15.200 --> 31:16.600
What the fuck?

31:16.667 --> 31:18.100
It's okay, Nikki,
give Jake some space.

31:18.167 --> 31:20.700
He just got sunned
by an earth.

31:20.767 --> 31:21.700
Bitch.

31:21.767 --> 31:23.433
Fuck you, egg roll.

31:23.500 --> 31:24.867
Fuck you, fat boy!

31:24.933 --> 31:26.167
Ooh...

31:28.467 --> 31:31.500
Hey. Don't listen
to that knucklehead.

31:31.567 --> 31:32.967
Uh, I-- I won't.

31:33.067 --> 31:34.200
Hey, I'm Ralph McDaniels.

31:34.267 --> 31:36.800
I'm Josie Cho, hey.
Nice to meet you.

31:36.867 --> 31:38.867
I'd love to see your photos
when you get 'em developed.

31:38.933 --> 31:41.400
Yeah!

32:41.067 --> 32:42.667
Yo, what you doing?

32:42.733 --> 32:44.067
Yo, what you want me
to do with her?

32:44.067 --> 32:45.067
Let her go.
Don't you even--

32:45.100 --> 32:46.067
Fuck you mean?
Let her go!

32:46.100 --> 32:47.767
Fuck, man!

32:47.833 --> 32:49.233
Come on, bitch.
Come on.

32:51.967 --> 32:53.333
Don't even
think about it.

32:53.400 --> 32:55.500
Run, bitch!

33:08.467 --> 33:11.133
All right, y'all, all right,
y'all, this is it!

33:11.200 --> 33:14.100
Our challenger DeeVee is about
ready to get this shit started,

33:14.167 --> 33:17.067
so without any further ado,
let's go, DeeVee.

34:11.367 --> 34:13.167
Hey!

34:13.233 --> 34:14.667
Hey!

34:15.633 --> 34:17.133
Hey!

34:24.767 --> 34:26.900
Oh, ho ho, the pressure.

34:26.967 --> 34:28.167
The pressure.

34:28.233 --> 34:30.533
Somebody lost control
of their vehicle.

34:35.267 --> 34:37.067
Hey, man, close,
but no cigar.

34:37.067 --> 34:39.067
Make some noise
for DeeVee, y'all.

34:44.367 --> 34:46.300
Hey...
congratulations, man.

34:46.367 --> 34:47.533
I was worried
for a minute.

34:52.500 --> 34:54.900
Now, that was
fuckin' fantastic.

34:56.867 --> 34:58.200
Yo, Young God,

34:58.267 --> 35:01.300
every time I see you,
you doing big things, man.

35:01.367 --> 35:03.367
Ah, thank you,
big homey.

35:03.433 --> 35:05.500
Word. We gotta
get in the studio.

35:05.567 --> 35:07.167
Absolutely,
without a doubt.

35:07.233 --> 35:08.467
Word.

35:08.533 --> 35:10.600
Yo, these shorties
trying to holler at you.

35:12.933 --> 35:14.133
Yeah?

35:14.200 --> 35:15.367
Mm-hmm.

35:15.433 --> 35:16.567
Word.

35:23.133 --> 35:24.667
I'm Barry from
Ray Fouray Records.

35:24.733 --> 35:26.667
I understand you manage
Imani X.

35:26.733 --> 35:29.067
And I'm her mother,
Ella Williams.

35:29.133 --> 35:30.667
Well, it's nice
to meet you.

35:30.733 --> 35:32.267
Listen, I need your daughter
in the studio right now,

35:32.333 --> 35:34.067
and by right now, I mean
right now right now.

35:34.133 --> 35:35.200
Hold up,slim.

35:35.267 --> 35:37.800
I been hearing
a lot of stuff about you,

35:37.867 --> 35:39.767
and most of it
ain't good.

35:39.833 --> 35:42.600
If people ain't hating some,
you ain't doing it, right?

35:42.667 --> 35:44.433
I'm doing it.

35:44.500 --> 35:46.867
So let me ask you this.

35:46.933 --> 35:48.633
Like, what you do you need
to be on board?

35:48.700 --> 35:50.367
What-- what do you
really need?

35:50.433 --> 35:52.267
Two things.

35:52.333 --> 35:53.300
Okay.

35:53.367 --> 35:56.100
$25,000 up front.

35:57.600 --> 35:59.100
You got it.

35:59.167 --> 36:00.267
Cool.
What else?

36:02.067 --> 36:04.933
I want that bitch
out the picture.

36:13.600 --> 36:15.333
What? What's up?

36:15.400 --> 36:16.867
Barry's signing Imani X.

36:16.933 --> 36:18.600
Really?
Mm-hmm.

36:18.667 --> 36:20.833
Yo! And?

36:20.900 --> 36:23.867
And you ain't a part
of her team.

36:23.933 --> 36:24.700
What?

36:24.767 --> 36:26.733
You reap what you sow.

36:32.700 --> 36:34.767
Hey, Nikki...

36:36.100 --> 36:37.867
Could I talk to you
for a minute?

36:37.933 --> 36:39.967
Yeah, sure, what's up?

36:40.067 --> 36:45.067
Uh, it'd be great if you could
get your stuff out of my place.

36:46.133 --> 36:48.100
Okay. Sure, I'll
come by tonight.

36:48.167 --> 36:51.800
Great. I'll, uh,
I'll stay out later tonight.

36:56.133 --> 36:57.767
Perfect.

38:08.600 --> 38:10.733
Wanna look
at Mommy's notes?

38:10.800 --> 38:12.067
What is that?

38:14.833 --> 38:16.700
What's that?

39:10.200 --> 39:12.800
Jesus, David, I'm out.

39:12.867 --> 39:14.133
You got it.

39:27.367 --> 39:28.500
Next time on "The Breaks"...

39:28.567 --> 39:30.067
Yo, y'all, I'm ready.

39:31.100 --> 39:32.767
What's your angle
in all this?

39:32.833 --> 39:34.067
We don't know this girl.

39:35.400 --> 39:36.433
I need your help.

39:36.500 --> 39:38.300
We're good,
the two of us.

39:41.700 --> 39:42.700
What's in the bag?

39:42.767 --> 39:45.200
You got some balls.

39:45.267 --> 39:48.200
He could die.
My baby is not gonna die.

39:50.667 --> 39:52.100
Put the God damn gun down!
