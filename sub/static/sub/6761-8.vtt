01:42.685 --> 01:46.022
Dinner wasn't that bad
once we got past the two-hour wait.

01:46.105 --> 01:48.775
It was just so damn loud in there,
we couldn't even talk.

01:48.858 --> 01:51.945
We were lucky even to get in there.
Everybody wants to eat there.

01:52.028 --> 01:54.072
Yeah, that's this month.

01:54.155 --> 01:55.907
Now I know
why everybody's so thin here.

01:55.990 --> 01:59.619
By the time you get served,
you've lost your appetite.

02:07.043 --> 02:11.172
You know, it's our first anniversary
away from home in 17 years.

02:11.422 --> 02:13.299
Honey, this is our home now.

02:17.553 --> 02:21.599
Jim, you have to work
on our anniversary?

02:22.516 --> 02:25.436
The IRS doesn't know
it's our anniversary.

02:27.104 --> 02:29.690
But I'll take a personal exemption.

02:32.693 --> 02:35.071
Remember our first anniversary?

02:36.989 --> 02:41.035
- We ate dinner in bed.
- Yeah, I'm getting hungry.

02:42.578 --> 02:44.747
So you really like the ties I gave you?

02:44.830 --> 02:47.666
I'll tell you all about it later.

02:48.751 --> 02:50.336
Jim, whoa.

02:50.419 --> 02:53.380
I mean, couldn't we talk a little first?

02:59.053 --> 03:00.512
Let's talk.

03:00.888 --> 03:04.141
- I just need to feel a little intimate.
- I know.

03:05.643 --> 03:09.438
But I'm sorry, honey,
I gotta put another hour of work in.

03:09.605 --> 03:12.566
I'll go downstairs so I don't bother you.

03:30.501 --> 03:32.961
You couldn't feel the tension
between Mom and Dad at breakfast?

03:33.045 --> 03:35.172
No, because there was nothing to feel.

03:35.255 --> 03:36.798
When Mom doesn't slice
Dad's grapefruit

03:36.882 --> 03:38.592
and when Dad grabs
Mom's gardening section,

03:38.675 --> 03:42.220
- you know something's down and dirty.
- Yeah, your imagination.

03:43.096 --> 03:47.225
Come on, Brenda, they're married.
They're supposed to be crabby.

03:48.644 --> 03:51.063
They never used to be that way.

04:15.670 --> 04:17.047
<i>Yo, West Beverly!</i>

04:17.130 --> 04:19.882
<i>Hey, get on up and get down
'Cause I won't be around</i>

04:19.966 --> 04:22.927
<i>This my goodbye song
and I'm gonna skip town</i>

04:23.011 --> 04:25.388
<i>DJ Mike MC has gotta leave</i>

04:25.472 --> 04:27.682
<i>So watch out all you DJ wannabes</i>

04:27.766 --> 04:30.268
<i>You better get up and get down
and do your chores</i>

04:30.352 --> 04:32.729
<i>'Cause the next voice that you hear
could be yours</i>

04:32.812 --> 04:33.855
<i>Peace.</i>

04:33.938 --> 04:37.734
Imagine being the school DJ.
Everyone being forced to listen to you.

04:37.817 --> 04:39.235
You should.

04:39.527 --> 04:41.696
- Your mouth's big enough.
- Yeah, right, come on.

04:41.779 --> 04:44.073
Freshman DJ? Dream on.

04:44.157 --> 04:46.576
- Come on, man, why not?
- Why not?

04:47.577 --> 04:50.163
Because he'll be competing with me.

04:52.707 --> 04:54.334
I rest my case.

04:56.794 --> 04:58.463
So what do you think?

04:58.546 --> 05:02.091
How would you like to participate
in my professor friend's twin study

05:02.175 --> 05:03.509
at the University?

05:03.593 --> 05:06.804
She's got a couple of sets of identicals
from Beverly High,

05:06.888 --> 05:09.057
but she's desperate for fraternals.

05:09.140 --> 05:12.143
- A college study. Cool.
- No. No way.

05:12.518 --> 05:15.188
I hate those zoos.
I'm not gonna be a guinea pig.

05:15.271 --> 05:18.232
Well, these particular guinea pigs
get money

05:18.316 --> 05:22.361
and a time off from school,
but I respect your feelings.

05:22.445 --> 05:23.946
Well, no, no. Now, wait a minute.

05:24.030 --> 05:25.740
Wait a minute, this could be interesting.

05:25.823 --> 05:29.952
Now, I've read about those studies
where they send one far away.

05:30.494 --> 05:32.747
That's what we're talking about here,
Miss Rye, right?

05:32.830 --> 05:37.168
- Brenda in Siberia?
- Oh, well, anything for science, right?

05:38.836 --> 05:40.379
Oh, these are gorgeous.

05:41.213 --> 05:43.924
And I want some.

05:44.300 --> 05:45.468
Oh...

05:49.555 --> 05:51.599
They are stunning.

05:58.314 --> 06:00.816
- Plants do better in clay.
- Yeah.

06:00.900 --> 06:03.736
You know, I don't know
anything about cactus.

06:03.819 --> 06:05.279
Look.

06:05.362 --> 06:06.488
- What?
- There.

06:06.572 --> 06:09.825
<i>Oh, God! Lots of locos around here.
Come on.</i>

06:12.036 --> 06:13.203
Wait!

06:20.336 --> 06:21.545
Cindy?

06:22.004 --> 06:23.172
Glen!

06:24.423 --> 06:26.425
Oh, my God.

06:30.053 --> 06:31.513
How are you?

06:32.222 --> 06:34.016
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.852
I see you still have your feet
planted on the ground.

06:36.935 --> 06:39.438
Yeah, and you're still hiding
behind your camera lenses.

06:39.521 --> 06:42.441
Oh, I'm sorry, this is my assistant,
Anna Rodriguez. Glen Evans.

06:42.524 --> 06:45.277
- An old friend.
- Very old.

06:45.611 --> 06:47.321
How long has it been?

06:47.529 --> 06:50.073
- Twenty years?
- Graduation, right?

06:50.157 --> 06:52.242
- Oh, yes.
- You wore black.

06:53.618 --> 06:55.245
It's been too long.

06:55.329 --> 06:58.582
I didn't even realize who you were
when I just took your picture now.

06:58.665 --> 06:59.708
Oh.

07:00.333 --> 07:02.627
So, what are you doing here?

07:02.878 --> 07:04.296
My friend owns this nursery.

07:04.379 --> 07:06.506
He needed some catalogue photos,
and I had some spare time.

07:06.590 --> 07:08.300
No, I mean in L.A.

07:08.800 --> 07:10.510
This is home now.

07:11.219 --> 07:13.013
I got burnt out on all that traveling.

07:13.096 --> 07:16.892
I needed to put my tripod and ego
on shaky ground.

07:16.975 --> 07:20.103
<i>I clipped all your
National Geographic photos.</i>

07:20.520 --> 07:22.939
<i>I always figured you
for a National G lifer.</i>

07:23.023 --> 07:24.649
Oh, I even framed
your Pulitzer prize winner.

07:24.733 --> 07:26.610
It was breathtaking.

07:26.943 --> 07:28.194
You, too.

07:28.278 --> 07:30.947
- You look wonderful.
- Yeah, right.

07:31.031 --> 07:33.533
- All my soiled splendor.
- How about Jim?

07:33.616 --> 07:36.077
Same old Jim. He's fine. We're fine.

07:36.161 --> 07:38.705
- We've got two kids.
- Twins, right?

07:39.289 --> 07:41.583
I read about it in the alumni magazine.

07:41.666 --> 07:43.960
And you? No wedding ring?

07:44.043 --> 07:48.047
Me? Still crazy and living with my lenses
after all these years.

07:48.131 --> 07:51.426
Well, you and your lenses
have to come to dinner.

07:51.759 --> 07:53.386
Come on,
I'll get you a good deal on that.

07:53.469 --> 07:55.597
Okay, dinner and dessert.

07:56.848 --> 08:00.643
The other guys and I
barely got the exposed film out on time.

08:00.810 --> 08:04.647
Tiananmen Square sounds intense.
Where else have you shot?

08:04.731 --> 08:06.983
Oh, come on, I don't want to bore you
with any more of this.

08:07.066 --> 08:09.694
- Oh, we never hear stories like this.
- Yeah, come on.

08:09.777 --> 08:11.988
Nothing compares to the riot
your dad and I caused

08:12.071 --> 08:14.115
when we worked together.

08:14.574 --> 08:15.700
When was that?

08:15.783 --> 08:18.536
Oh, come on, you know,
when I wrote for the college literary rag.

08:18.619 --> 08:20.371
Yeah, that's how your parents met.

08:20.455 --> 08:23.166
- I was going out with your mom.
- You and Mom went out?

08:23.249 --> 08:24.459
Only a few times.

08:24.542 --> 08:27.753
On our one-month anniversary,
she came to see me.

08:27.837 --> 08:31.674
And stupid cupid me,
I introduced her to your dad.

08:31.757 --> 08:35.052
- Worst mistake of my life.
- They met through you?

08:35.385 --> 08:36.929
How romantic.

08:37.263 --> 08:39.097
Dad, I didn't know
you worked on a magazine.

08:39.181 --> 08:40.265
No.

08:40.433 --> 08:43.852
- With me, it was just amateur hour.
- Oh, nonsense. Come on.

08:43.936 --> 08:46.314
Your old man had a lot of potential
in that area.

08:46.397 --> 08:49.400
Who would have thought you'd end up
crunching numbers, Jim?

08:49.483 --> 08:50.693
Right.

08:51.110 --> 08:53.320
I'd like to join you on this stroll
down memory lane,

08:53.404 --> 08:55.698
but I'm on a killer deadline.

08:56.115 --> 08:59.618
Let me tell you, Glen,
audited people really know how to riot.

08:59.702 --> 09:02.455
- Good night.
- I've enjoyed comparing lives.

09:02.538 --> 09:04.123
Don't work too hard, honey,
I'll be up soon.

09:04.206 --> 09:07.710
- Good night, kids.
- Wow, how'd it get to be so late?

09:07.793 --> 09:11.046
Brandon and I turn into twin guinea pigs
first thing in the morning.

09:11.130 --> 09:15.259
Yeah, they're gonna shock us into
pretending Brenda's as good as I am.

09:15.342 --> 09:17.469
But we all know that I'm really better.

09:17.553 --> 09:20.556
Sometimes they're just like
an old married couple.

09:20.639 --> 09:23.017
Twins. Double the pleasure.

09:23.559 --> 09:27.021
A photographer's dream.
You know, I'd like to shoot you two.

09:27.104 --> 09:29.022
- Yin meets yang.
- Wow.

09:29.440 --> 09:31.775
- Give me a call, we'll set something up.
- Great.

09:31.859 --> 09:33.193
- Good night, Glen.
- Good night.

09:33.277 --> 09:35.237
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night.

09:37.239 --> 09:39.491
You have made Brenda's year.

09:40.534 --> 09:43.120
- They're a great set of kids.
- Yeah.

09:44.746 --> 09:48.584
You know, Glen's a guy whose life
I'd actually want when I'm older.

09:48.667 --> 09:52.713
Yeah, he's super,
except I think he's got the hots for Mom.

09:52.796 --> 09:54.089
For Mom?

09:55.841 --> 09:57.175
Dream on.

10:01.388 --> 10:02.931
That was very funny.

10:03.265 --> 10:05.308
Oh, I was so embarrassed.

10:05.809 --> 10:08.478
I haven't thought about that in years.

10:08.562 --> 10:11.022
- More coffee?
- No. Thanks.

10:11.857 --> 10:14.484
Oh, I read about you and that model.

10:14.734 --> 10:16.820
Well, that lasted a second.

10:16.903 --> 10:19.030
Actually, I just ended
a long-term relationship

10:19.114 --> 10:22.534
with a foreign correspondent
in El Salvador.

10:23.076 --> 10:24.661
She lost a lot.

10:57.861 --> 11:02.740
I'm gonna show you my L.A.
You will fall in love with it.

11:09.622 --> 11:11.374
Where's this testing centre, anyway?

11:11.457 --> 11:15.336
When we hear the torture screams,
we'll know we've arrived.

11:16.587 --> 11:18.673
I could get used to this.

11:19.340 --> 11:21.551
Yeah, this is seriously cool.

11:22.176 --> 11:24.345
This'll be us in a couple years, Bren.

11:24.429 --> 11:26.013
Do you think we'll go to the same place?

11:26.097 --> 11:27.849
Our lives could get set here.

11:27.932 --> 11:29.642
Yeah, Mom and Dad met at college.

11:29.725 --> 11:32.019
Don't you ever wonder how people
stay together all that time?

11:32.103 --> 11:34.605
I think when you find the right person,
like Mom and Dad did,

11:34.689 --> 11:36.190
it just happens.

11:36.274 --> 11:38.734
Yeah, but don't you even think about
how Mom and Dad found each other?

11:38.818 --> 11:40.111
I mean, they're so far apart.

11:40.194 --> 11:42.446
It's like they're so different
they're the same.

11:42.530 --> 11:45.116
Yeah, well, they didn't seem so similar
at 3:00 this morning

11:45.199 --> 11:47.076
when Mom was downstairs
alone with Glen.

11:47.159 --> 11:51.706
- You know, she never stays up that late.
- I thought we buried this one already.

11:51.789 --> 11:54.041
Come on, maybe
the research center’s over here.

11:54.125 --> 11:56.419
Trust me, Brandon. We have arrived.

12:03.008 --> 12:04.301
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:09.640 --> 12:10.933
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:18.148 --> 12:20.317
- You're next.
- You wish.

12:20.401 --> 12:23.612
You gotta see L.A. In a convertible,
otherwise you'll miss it.

12:23.696 --> 12:26.073
I love it. I had no idea.

12:27.241 --> 12:31.161
- Great colors.
- Everything is so vibrant and alive.

12:31.787 --> 12:33.497
- Here we are.
- It's like being in a different world.

12:33.580 --> 12:35.999
- Oh, it's wonderful.
- Yes, it is.

12:36.625 --> 12:38.752
- Oh, this is so...
- Not Minnesota.

12:39.378 --> 12:41.672
You know, the good news about it
being so transient here

12:41.755 --> 12:44.675
is that things and people
don't get stuck.

12:45.175 --> 12:47.261
You gotta scratch the surface here.

12:47.344 --> 12:51.431
There are plenty of folks
doing interesting, cutting-edge work.

12:55.143 --> 12:57.312
It is a different world.

13:01.608 --> 13:04.861
- So how's married life?
- Great. Seventeen years.

13:08.115 --> 13:09.866
That's a marathon.

13:10.617 --> 13:13.328
Make it sound like an endurance test.

13:14.663 --> 13:18.416
This one is less natural.
It's almost manipulated.

13:18.500 --> 13:20.877
Oh, well, don't hold back now.

13:21.920 --> 13:23.463
No, seriously.

13:24.339 --> 13:28.468
I have always liked the way you tell me
exactly what you think.

13:29.427 --> 13:32.556
So, tell me what you're thinking.

13:36.601 --> 13:39.020
That you and Jim are like night and day.

13:39.104 --> 13:43.441
I never really knew him that well,
but he seems harder to read than ever.

13:43.525 --> 13:45.360
You know
what they say about opposites.

13:45.443 --> 13:46.861
We attract.

14:07.507 --> 14:09.968
We're like teenage mutant twins.

14:12.387 --> 14:14.639
Hi, I'm Harriet Strathmore.

14:14.722 --> 14:18.059
And welcome to Noah's Ark's den
of scientific sin.

14:18.142 --> 14:20.687
We'll start with some ESP games.

14:20.770 --> 14:22.730
Okay, Brandon, concentrate.

14:22.814 --> 14:25.441
What playing card
is your sister looking at?

14:28.778 --> 14:30.029
Eight.

14:30.113 --> 14:32.657
Gotta be. That's my lucky number.

14:33.407 --> 14:34.951
Ten of hearts.

14:44.168 --> 14:45.878
Queen of spades.

14:48.172 --> 14:50.007
How did you do that?

14:50.383 --> 14:53.177
He cheated.
The cards have gotta be marked.

14:54.929 --> 14:56.597
So, anyway, we were separated at birth.

14:56.681 --> 14:59.266
- When I was five, I had the worst...
- Stomach ache.

14:59.350 --> 15:01.644
It turned out
I was about to have appendicitis.

15:01.727 --> 15:05.189
Yeah, well, last Friday,
I knew my sister was gonna be upset.

15:05.272 --> 15:09.276
Brandon, that's because you knew
I was having an English quiz.

15:13.948 --> 15:17.284
Now, try not to get too competitive
with these IQ tests.

15:17.368 --> 15:19.370
No one ever aces these.

15:30.506 --> 15:33.342
Do you remember
the first time I met you?

15:33.425 --> 15:37.012
You offered me some of your
Swedish ivy to transplant.

15:39.098 --> 15:43.143
Well, we've come a long way
since the University of Minnesota.

15:43.811 --> 15:46.063
Do you ever play "what if"?

15:48.565 --> 15:51.109
Like, what if you hadn't met Jim?

15:51.276 --> 15:54.196
- Would you have really liked me?
- You bet.

15:55.656 --> 15:57.908
You know,
I was pretty conceited back then.

15:57.991 --> 16:01.119
And you were the only one
who wasn't impressed.

16:01.203 --> 16:02.579
But I was.

16:03.247 --> 16:05.791
I just tried hard not to show it.

16:06.625 --> 16:10.379
Oh, I can't believe how late it is.
I've got to be going.

16:11.046 --> 16:13.298
Must be nice having people waiting.

16:14.049 --> 16:15.759
Yeah, it's nice.

16:17.094 --> 16:20.889
I will only let you escape
if you come to my opening tomorrow.

16:20.972 --> 16:22.182
Sure.

16:22.891 --> 16:24.434
We'd love to.

16:29.314 --> 16:32.776
Absolutely extraordinary,
and Glen's backlighting.

16:32.859 --> 16:36.279
Oh, he just has
the most sensitive touch.

16:37.322 --> 16:39.324
Jim, are you listening?

16:40.659 --> 16:43.036
I'm sorry, honey. I'm just spacing out.

16:43.119 --> 16:46.539
It was the first time
I actually felt at home here.

16:47.207 --> 16:50.835
- You've just got to see the canals.
- I don't have time.

16:51.836 --> 16:54.714
Maybe Glen can hang out
like a perpetual teenager.

16:54.798 --> 16:57.759
There's not too many teenagers who've
won every creative award possible.

16:57.842 --> 16:59.969
It's easier to do when you don't have
to bring home the bacon

17:00.053 --> 17:02.138
to a family in Beverly Hills.

17:02.222 --> 17:04.557
You sound just like my father.

17:05.974 --> 17:08.310
- Hey.
- No. Honey, it's late.

17:23.326 --> 17:25.161
<i>So warm up those voices,</i>

17:25.243 --> 17:28.665
<i>it's DJ time.</i>

17:28.748 --> 17:30.833
<i>Yo, West Beverly, my name is Dave</i>

17:30.917 --> 17:33.211
<i>I'm gonna give to you all the songs
that you crave</i>

17:33.294 --> 17:35.588
<i>And all the babes
are gonna be my slave</i>

17:35.671 --> 17:37.215
<i>And all from a guy
Who don't even shave</i>

17:37.298 --> 17:38.341
<i>Word</i>

17:41.803 --> 17:43.805
So do you wanna go
to an art party tonight?

17:43.888 --> 17:46.182
- Definitely.
- My mom's a friend of the artist.

17:46.265 --> 17:49.519
He's supposed to shoot photos
of me and Brandon tomorrow.

17:49.602 --> 17:54.065
You could be like a famous model.
Brenda Brinkley, Brenda Evangelista.

17:54.565 --> 17:56.192
So this guy's gorgeous, right?

17:56.275 --> 17:59.487
Yeah, I wish he'd flirt with me
rather than my mom.

17:59.570 --> 18:02.615
I think he's trying to have
an affair with her or something.

18:02.698 --> 18:03.824
Men.

18:03.908 --> 18:06.285
They can never settle
for just being friends.

18:06.369 --> 18:08.662
Yeah, but my mom
is acting really weird.

18:08.746 --> 18:10.790
Almost like a teenager.

18:23.260 --> 18:25.346
Mom, what you're wearing is great.

18:25.429 --> 18:27.765
Oh, I don't know.
Something's a little off.

18:27.848 --> 18:29.391
How about this one?

18:29.475 --> 18:32.394
Well, it's cool, too.
But what's the difference?

18:33.354 --> 18:34.897
I just can't decide.

18:35.731 --> 18:37.524
You sound like me.

18:37.900 --> 18:39.485
Are you wearing perfume?

18:39.568 --> 18:41.737
Well, it's not perfume.
It's just toilet water.

18:41.820 --> 18:44.698
You know, Bren, I was thinking,
since you're Miss Figure-lt-Out,

18:44.782 --> 18:48.160
you ought to take over
figuring out all our chores.

18:48.243 --> 18:49.828
Did I miss something?

18:49.912 --> 18:51.747
Yeah, according to that twin study,

18:51.830 --> 18:54.917
Brenda's a brainiac
at quantitative analysis.

18:56.043 --> 18:58.837
Oh, just my dream
to be a math teacher.

18:59.296 --> 19:03.217
Brandon is Mr English.
The other IQ test results are in the mail.

19:03.300 --> 19:05.761
Yeah, along with
my long-lost anniversary present.

19:05.844 --> 19:07.846
Yeah, I don't really believe
in all these tests anyway.

19:07.930 --> 19:10.015
I mean, who needs to know this stuff?

19:10.766 --> 19:14.019
I think it's interesting
to learn more about yourself.

19:14.102 --> 19:15.771
Oh, I'll get it.

19:20.567 --> 19:22.152
<i>- Hello?
- Hi.</i>

19:22.778 --> 19:24.946
- Guess what?
- You're not coming, right?

19:25.030 --> 19:27.574
<i>- Right, I'm stuck.
- Oh, well.</i>

19:28.825 --> 19:32.579
- What, you're not going to impale me?
- Well, work comes first, right?

19:32.662 --> 19:35.707
- We'll miss you.
- Right. Me, too.

19:36.082 --> 19:38.168
<i>- Bye.
- Okay. Bye.</i>

19:43.882 --> 19:47.344
Well, you seen one snapshot,
you seen them all, huh?

19:48.553 --> 19:50.889
Bob, did you always aspire
to be an accountant?

19:50.972 --> 19:52.140
Oh, sure.

19:52.223 --> 19:56.061
After my professional baseball career
folded at the age of 12.

19:56.144 --> 19:59.105
- You?
- Poetry. Not exactly lucrative.

19:59.522 --> 20:00.899
Yeah, well.

20:01.524 --> 20:04.694
Let's see if we can find some poetry
in these numbers.

20:04.778 --> 20:05.987
Right.

20:22.420 --> 20:25.089
- Glen is the coolest.
- I told you.

20:25.632 --> 20:27.008
Too cool for my mom.

20:27.091 --> 20:29.469
Cool enough
to take your picture though.

20:29.552 --> 20:32.138
You're right, Mom doesn't fit in here.

20:32.221 --> 20:34.140
Sticking out here is fitting in.

20:34.223 --> 20:39.437
So, Bren, what's your brilliant, deep,
quantitative analysis here, huh?

20:39.520 --> 20:40.813
A woman.

20:41.439 --> 20:43.232
A very lonely woman.

20:43.316 --> 20:46.778
And what's your superficial word
on the subject, Brandon?

20:46.861 --> 20:50.031
I don't know, she looks confused,
she looks lost.

20:50.114 --> 20:53.534
<i>No, you're both wrong.
It's called Dancing With Myself.</i>

20:53.618 --> 20:54.744
See?

20:57.246 --> 21:01.208
You two will be up there soon.
My newest subjects.

21:01.292 --> 21:04.420
Excuse me. Glen, it's been so long.

21:04.503 --> 21:06.339
Debera. Excuse me.

21:08.466 --> 21:09.508
Hi.

21:15.890 --> 21:20.144
Join me for a breath of fresh smog.
I need a break.

21:23.355 --> 21:25.232
Where are they going?

21:28.360 --> 21:31.155
How does it feel to be such a success?

21:31.822 --> 21:33.490
I wouldn't know.

21:33.866 --> 21:37.328
You are the most modest
conceited man I've ever met.

21:37.912 --> 21:40.289
You're the one who's a success.

21:41.540 --> 21:44.501
No, really. You have a family, stability.

21:45.377 --> 21:48.589
These are all images here,
except for you.

21:49.590 --> 21:52.509
You go home and I stay
and I toast myself.

21:53.302 --> 21:57.681
There are plenty of beautiful glasses
for the great artist to clink.

21:58.140 --> 21:59.641
Plastic ones.

22:01.018 --> 22:04.438
You get past a certain age,
the great women get taken.

22:04.521 --> 22:06.982
I worked hard
and now I find myself alone.

22:07.065 --> 22:11.194
I'm ready to settle down,
but I'm not willing to settle, Cindy.

22:12.779 --> 22:15.908
It's too bad Jim missed you here
in your glory.

22:16.325 --> 22:18.660
You're the one that got away.

22:19.202 --> 22:22.622
We could be in the midst of
a great adventure in the Himalayas.

22:22.706 --> 22:24.458
Freedom fantasies.

22:24.833 --> 22:27.794
I can just see me riding on a camel

22:28.045 --> 22:32.507
with a ring in my nose
and bells on my toes.

22:33.216 --> 22:36.052
Jim would just die seeing me like that.

23:04.956 --> 23:07.584
They were gone 20 minutes
from the gallery.

23:07.667 --> 23:10.754
What would they have to talk about
for 20 minutes?

23:10.837 --> 23:13.548
All those gorgeous women,
and he picked your mom.

23:13.631 --> 23:16.217
I mean, she never listens
to music like this.

23:16.301 --> 23:18.344
Oh, my mom always does.

23:18.428 --> 23:21.848
Not necessarily a recommendation.
No offence.

23:23.016 --> 23:25.435
Listen, what are the signs of...

23:26.477 --> 23:28.605
You know, when your parents
aren't getting along?

23:28.688 --> 23:30.231
Divorce signs?

23:30.565 --> 23:35.111
Let's see, my mom spiffs up,
acts goofier than usual, irresponsible.

23:35.194 --> 23:37.572
"Like a schoolgirl," she says.

23:38.990 --> 23:43.536
I never thought I'd want to know this,
but what's it like being a divorced kid?

23:43.619 --> 23:45.538
Oh, it's not that bad.

23:46.038 --> 23:49.751
Okay, the arguing
and the gross polite silences stop,

23:49.959 --> 23:52.462
but the fallout is major.

23:53.588 --> 23:57.216
Your parents get these new lives.
And you're a left-out leftover.

24:00.428 --> 24:02.805
- Hey, there, scholars.
- Hey, Mr Walsh.

24:02.889 --> 24:04.098
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:04.181 --> 24:06.892
You missed a lot at the opening, Dad.

24:12.106 --> 24:14.066
When my dad started coming in late,

24:14.150 --> 24:17.278
my mom said the honeymoon
was definitely over.

24:43.012 --> 24:44.763
- Jim?
- Hi.

24:45.848 --> 24:48.434
- You're home early.
- It's 10:30.

24:48.851 --> 24:50.352
Is it? Oh.

24:53.605 --> 24:58.110
Turns out that audit should have gone
to Bob and a more senior partner.

24:58.861 --> 25:01.530
I'm gonna have a rough couple weeks.

25:03.073 --> 25:06.326
But then, maybe we can
find some time together.

25:06.410 --> 25:09.746
Jim, you've been saying that
since we moved here.

25:10.080 --> 25:12.249
Maybe you just don't want
time with me anymore.

25:12.332 --> 25:13.375
Just admit it.

25:13.458 --> 25:15.002
Well, maybe you give me
such a hard time,

25:15.085 --> 25:17.004
I don't want the time.

25:25.220 --> 25:29.016
Aren't you even gonna ask
about the opening, about my day?

25:29.099 --> 25:30.809
I'm tired, honey.

25:46.116 --> 25:49.452
I forgot, sex is the biggie.
My mother says that goes first.

25:49.536 --> 25:52.998
My mom doesn't even talk about that.
They probably don't even have sex.

25:53.081 --> 25:55.458
You and Brandon were
immaculately conceived, right?

25:55.542 --> 25:58.420
Having us was enough
to scare them off forever.

25:58.503 --> 26:00.088
- Bye.
- Bye.

26:06.845 --> 26:08.555
What do you mean, "Don't worry"?

26:08.638 --> 26:10.473
Last time
Mom didn't cut Dad's grapefruit,

26:10.557 --> 26:12.142
but today she didn't even buy him one.

26:12.225 --> 26:14.352
And he tossed her gardening section
before she even read it.

26:14.436 --> 26:17.647
So they're getting on
each other's nerves, so what?

26:17.730 --> 26:22.110
- This study's getting on my nerves.
- That fits in with your personality profile.

26:22.193 --> 26:23.903
You avoid probing beneath the surface

26:23.987 --> 26:26.406
and have a tendency
to gloss things over with words.

26:26.489 --> 26:27.615
Thank you.

26:27.699 --> 26:31.202
And you're more intuitive.
Open, but impressionable.

26:31.286 --> 26:33.371
Two peas in a pod, right?

26:33.454 --> 26:38.084
Let's play some behavioral roulette.
Tell me about what goes on at home.

26:38.418 --> 26:41.337
Well, it used to be pretty cool for home.

26:41.879 --> 26:43.589
But now there's super tension.

26:43.673 --> 26:46.259
Dad's just tired
and Mom's wired about...

26:46.342 --> 26:47.885
You're as blind as Dad.

26:47.969 --> 26:49.887
You men, you think
if you don't deal with stuff

26:49.971 --> 26:51.013
it'll just go away.

26:51.097 --> 26:53.516
- Brenda, what would you do?
- I'd stop it.

26:53.599 --> 26:55.768
I'd try and get Mom and Dad back
like they used to be.

26:55.852 --> 26:58.729
I'd butt out, let them work it out!

26:58.813 --> 27:02.650
They'll be better off without your
scientific meddling, and so will we.

27:02.733 --> 27:04.026
Brandon!

27:06.028 --> 27:08.447
Just one big happy family, huh?

27:11.534 --> 27:13.202
Why won't you talk about this?

27:13.286 --> 27:15.079
It's just like what
Professor Strathmore said.

27:15.162 --> 27:18.666
You're scared to look at it.
You really are just like Dad. So open.

27:18.749 --> 27:21.252
And you're carrying on like Mom
at her most unrelenting.

27:21.335 --> 27:24.255
- Sometimes I hate being your twin.
- Ditto.

27:26.841 --> 27:30.761
Brandon, I'm telling you,
Mom and Dad are at this danger point.

27:30.845 --> 27:32.555
I mean, divorce is considered cool
out here.

27:32.638 --> 27:35.349
Look, all Mom and Dad need
is a little time together

27:35.432 --> 27:38.227
- and a lot of sex.
- You really think they still do that?

27:38.310 --> 27:39.436
Well, grow up, Bren,

27:39.520 --> 27:41.480
what do you think it means
when their door is locked?

27:41.564 --> 27:43.649
Yeah, well, the door
hasn't been locked lately.

27:43.732 --> 27:47.278
And if they do split up, what happens?
We switch off parents?

27:47.361 --> 27:50.155
Hey, don't worry. We're stuck together.

27:55.828 --> 27:58.747
<i>Cindy, the plants, estan tan lindas.</i>

27:59.540 --> 28:02.126
I'm sorry this job is almost over.

28:04.753 --> 28:07.798
<i>Hi, it's Glen. I've called four times.</i>

28:08.549 --> 28:11.468
<i>Are you out making
landscaping history again?</i>

28:11.552 --> 28:12.845
<i>Call me.</i>

28:20.811 --> 28:23.188
Life's so damn crazy sometimes.

28:25.148 --> 28:27.693
Assuming it's true, which I'm not,
what are we supposed to do?

28:27.776 --> 28:30.487
Sit them down
and have a kid-to-parent talk?

28:30.570 --> 28:32.739
No, you can't talk to parents
on that mature a level.

28:32.823 --> 28:34.449
Tragic, but true.

28:34.533 --> 28:37.494
I could get Mom some trashy lingerie
and say that it was from Dad.

28:37.577 --> 28:39.162
Dad would never get her that.

28:39.246 --> 28:42.249
Well, see, that's it.
I mean, maybe she wants that.

28:42.332 --> 28:45.544
I got it. We'll rent them a limo and say
it's a belated anniversary present

28:45.627 --> 28:47.879
from us and Dad. They can go out
to a club, have a good time...

28:47.963 --> 28:49.631
No, no, no, that's pure Glen.

28:49.714 --> 28:52.759
We have to give them back
what they once had.

28:52.843 --> 28:55.053
- Rekindle the flame.
- Yeah.

28:59.808 --> 29:02.310
- Sure I can't help?
- Nope, nope, nope.

29:02.394 --> 29:05.313
We got everything totally under control.

29:10.026 --> 29:11.528
It smells done.

29:11.611 --> 29:15.949
Honey, don't hurt their feelings.
This is really very sweet of them.

29:17.617 --> 29:20.120
How are we gonna make it
to Glen's photo session on time?

29:20.203 --> 29:21.454
I feel weird even going.

29:21.538 --> 29:23.248
But, it'll give Mom and Dad
some time alone.

29:23.331 --> 29:25.041
Are they talking?

29:28.545 --> 29:30.004
They're not.

29:31.965 --> 29:34.759
Here, put some of these carrots
on here.

29:35.343 --> 29:39.514
It's weird how suddenly
we can't even talk to each other.

29:41.391 --> 29:43.309
Or be with each other.

29:44.978 --> 29:47.939
I have a vague memory
of what sex is like.

29:48.523 --> 29:50.566
Honey, what do you expect?

29:50.650 --> 29:55.696
I mean, you come home
from the office and you're so absentee.

29:57.532 --> 30:01.119
Nothing is lonelier than being in bed
with someone you feel alienated from.

30:01.202 --> 30:03.746
Listen, I am in over my head here.

30:03.830 --> 30:06.082
I have been in over my head
since we moved here.

30:06.165 --> 30:07.750
Then slow down.

30:08.209 --> 30:11.295
I don't care about big houses
and keeping up.

30:11.379 --> 30:13.923
You think I like killing myself like this?

30:14.757 --> 30:18.427
And I know it's not as glamorous
as what Glen is doing.

30:18.511 --> 30:21.055
Stop hiding behind your damn work!

30:28.688 --> 30:31.107
Look, I brought us out here.
I'm not gonna let you down.

30:31.190 --> 30:32.983
Honey, the only way
you're letting me down

30:33.067 --> 30:35.319
is by being absentee from you and me.

30:35.403 --> 30:36.487
Cindy, it takes two.

30:36.570 --> 30:39.949
You're not exactly around here
these days, either.

30:44.161 --> 30:47.248
I'm sorry.
I've got a mountain of work to do.

31:16.777 --> 31:18.070
Come in.

31:24.159 --> 31:25.702
I'm just gonna be here for a minute.

31:25.786 --> 31:27.788
- I've been calling you all day.
- I know.

31:27.871 --> 31:30.249
Listen, we have to talk.

31:30.874 --> 31:33.502
I... I got carried away last night.

31:34.086 --> 31:36.755
This isn't me, this isn't who I wanna be.

31:36.838 --> 31:41.176
Look, things aren't that black and white.
I have a surprise for you.

31:44.513 --> 31:46.098
These are you.

31:49.142 --> 31:51.520
You spent all this time on me?

31:56.316 --> 31:58.235
They're so beautiful.

32:00.070 --> 32:01.530
So are you.

32:02.781 --> 32:06.576
- I'm falling in love with you.
- No, Glen, you just think you are.

32:06.660 --> 32:10.330
- Oh, this isn't happening. I can't think.
- There's no need to.

32:10.413 --> 32:12.040
We're already having a mental affair,

32:12.123 --> 32:15.460
and that's far more dangerous
than a physical one.

32:16.211 --> 32:18.380
Glen, what are we gonna do?

32:19.172 --> 32:20.507
Haven't you always wondered

32:20.590 --> 32:23.718
what it would be like to make love
to each other?

32:23.802 --> 32:26.221
We've wanted to do this forever.

32:30.100 --> 32:32.727
No. I just can't handle this!

32:44.614 --> 32:47.408
I still can't believe
I bailed on work for this.

32:47.492 --> 32:50.078
- It's for a good cause.
- What, having your picture taken?

32:50.161 --> 32:52.205
No, scoping out Dad's competition.

32:52.288 --> 32:55.416
Brenda, just because Mom and Dad
are fighting doesn't mean that...

32:59.003 --> 33:03.299
- Mom's having an affair.
- I can't believe this is really happening.

33:03.841 --> 33:07.261
I just can't imagine
Mom doing something like this.

33:07.386 --> 33:10.890
Brandon, if Mom and Dad can fall apart,
anything can.

33:33.412 --> 33:35.122
You were up early.

33:36.999 --> 33:38.876
Had a lot on my mind.

33:40.127 --> 33:41.295
Yeah.

33:42.588 --> 33:44.840
I had trouble sleeping, too.

33:47.426 --> 33:50.054
I'm reading an interesting article.

33:51.222 --> 33:53.015
Sports or business?

33:53.974 --> 33:56.894
<i>University of Minnesota
Literary Journal.</i>

34:06.487 --> 34:10.783
You remember when you wrote that
piece? That was when we first met.

34:12.201 --> 34:16.038
<i>"Frost's The Road Not Taken
deals with unfulfilled dreams."</i>

34:18.748 --> 34:21.835
I guess I've been feeling
kind of frustrated.

34:22.127 --> 34:25.214
- I'm sorry, honey.
- Don't be.

34:28.342 --> 34:32.346
I was a lot smarter back in those days.
Look at what I wrote.

34:32.429 --> 34:36.099
"Hindsight and regrets
make one lose sight of

34:38.560 --> 34:40.312
"what's important."

34:45.900 --> 34:50.322
- No way I was going down without you.
- Going to say something to Mom?

34:57.496 --> 34:59.998
- Hi, Dad.
- How you doing, big guy?

35:00.207 --> 35:01.374
Fine.

35:01.500 --> 35:04.461
- How'd the photo session go, kids?
- Short.

35:04.586 --> 35:06.254
A complete bust.

35:06.922 --> 35:08.215
Mother,

35:09.966 --> 35:11.259
skip it.

35:12.719 --> 35:15.180
- Something we didn't say?
- Gotta bail, Dad.

35:15.263 --> 35:16.389
But what about something to eat?

35:16.473 --> 35:19.225
I mean, you kids always get nauseous
without something in your stomachs.

35:19.309 --> 35:21.102
I'm already nauseous.

35:21.186 --> 35:24.105
Lost my appetite.
Not an easy thing to do.

35:35.950 --> 35:38.620
I really wanted to say something,
but I just couldn't.

35:38.703 --> 35:39.996
I know.

35:40.497 --> 35:42.290
What would you say?

35:42.373 --> 35:46.461
- Isn't there anything that we can do?
- We can't fix them, Bren.

35:50.173 --> 35:52.258
I remember when I was a little girl

35:52.342 --> 35:55.595
and Dad went away
to this accounting convention.

35:56.137 --> 35:58.473
I thought he was gone forever.

35:59.182 --> 36:00.933
I cried and cried.

36:02.310 --> 36:04.437
And then I wished
with my magic star wand

36:04.520 --> 36:06.481
and then he came back.

36:08.608 --> 36:11.736
My eyes were so puffy,
I could barely see him.

36:14.697 --> 36:16.866
Wish I had a bag of tricks,

36:17.825 --> 36:19.327
but I don't.

36:33.382 --> 36:35.217
You've been spending
a lot of time with Glen.

36:35.301 --> 36:36.469
Some.

36:41.849 --> 36:43.768
I'm gonna go now, too.

36:48.898 --> 36:50.941
I just want you to know

36:51.859 --> 36:53.986
I really, really love you.

37:14.131 --> 37:16.925
- Jim. Hi.
- Hi.

37:18.552 --> 37:22.848
I was headed for work, decided this was
more important business to check out.

37:23.348 --> 37:25.392
Enter at your own risk.

37:35.986 --> 37:37.404
It's good.

37:39.406 --> 37:42.034
You were always really, really good.

37:42.367 --> 37:43.702
Thank you.

37:43.785 --> 37:47.372
You've gotten just what you wanted,
haven't you, Glen?

37:47.623 --> 37:49.041
Not everything.

37:49.124 --> 37:51.626
You know, I used to love writing.

37:52.753 --> 37:55.172
I suppose I wasn't great at it.

37:55.589 --> 37:59.051
Then Cindy and I met,
we got married, settled down.

38:00.385 --> 38:02.220
I was great at that.

38:02.846 --> 38:04.264
I remember.

38:04.973 --> 38:07.726
And then when she got pregnant
so quickly,

38:08.518 --> 38:10.437
I didn't want to take any more risks.

38:10.520 --> 38:14.441
So I took them for you,
and you got what we both wanted.

38:17.861 --> 38:20.614
I'm calling that, "The road not taken."

38:21.615 --> 38:23.116
That's right.

38:23.742 --> 38:26.036
Cindy and I are on that road,

38:26.369 --> 38:28.204
for better or worse.

38:30.999 --> 38:32.834
You know, in a marriage,

38:32.917 --> 38:35.587
if you're very lucky, you get 99%,

38:36.588 --> 38:38.673
but when that other one missing percent
bursts in,

38:38.757 --> 38:42.635
- it can feel like everything.
- An illusion I'm quite enamored of.

38:42.719 --> 38:44.471
Look, I hate to break up
this male bonding,

38:44.554 --> 38:47.390
- but...
- Stop feeding me meaningless lines.

38:47.474 --> 38:50.310
I know what you're up to, Glen.
I see what you're doing behind my back.

38:50.393 --> 38:52.187
Slipping in, buttering everyone up.

38:52.270 --> 38:56.024
- Look, I happen to like your family.
- Then respect it, damn it!

38:56.107 --> 38:58.443
You stay out of my home
and away from my wife!

38:58.526 --> 39:00.570
Look, this has caught me by surprise.

39:00.653 --> 39:02.780
Now some of this
is for Cindy to decide, isn't it?

39:02.864 --> 39:05.366
Cindy and I are in this together!

39:06.993 --> 39:10.872
If you want to finally grow up,
then get your own damn family,

39:10.955 --> 39:13.833
but don't you dare try
and take mine away from me!

39:23.759 --> 39:27.388
<i>Our next contestant

39:27.471 --> 39:29.348

39:47.491 --> 39:48.534

- Mike fright.

40:31.201 --> 40:34.204
Don't stop. Keep talking.

<i>So why did Kelly Taylor

<i>She what?</i>

40:38.250 --> 40:40.377
<i>Look, get out of my face
and off this mike!</i>

40:40.460 --> 40:44.590
<i>Why? So we can savor the scintillating
sound of dead air again?</i>

40:45.048 --> 40:47.509

40:56.852 --> 41:00.230
My God. I've created a monster.

41:06.027 --> 41:08.530
Just the twins I was looking for.

41:09.614 --> 41:10.824
What's wrong?

41:10.907 --> 41:13.493
Things are a little rough at home
right now.

41:13.577 --> 41:16.538
I'm sorry if we embarrassed you
with your friend.

41:16.621 --> 41:19.249
We were not the most ideal subjects.

41:19.332 --> 41:23.628
Yeah, maybe we're not even twins.
That will be today's family zinger.

41:23.712 --> 41:28.133
No, Harriet thought you were great.
Or as she put it,

41:28.216 --> 41:31.511
"Two of a kind."
I mean, she thinks you're a real team.

41:31.594 --> 41:36.182
Your family is very important to you.
Appreciate each other's strengths.

41:40.645 --> 41:42.981
At least we've got each other.

41:43.398 --> 41:45.692
Yeah, it helps being a team.

41:46.693 --> 41:48.778
I wish Mom and Dad were.

41:53.867 --> 41:55.076
Cindy.

41:59.664 --> 42:00.790
Hi.

42:02.584 --> 42:04.460
Sounds more like bye.

42:06.504 --> 42:09.590
- Still trying to improve my image, huh?
- No.

42:10.925 --> 42:13.011
I like everything I see.

42:15.263 --> 42:17.140
I'm glad you're here.

42:19.016 --> 42:20.351
You were right.

42:20.435 --> 42:23.354
We did have a mental affair.

42:25.356 --> 42:27.024
Past tense, huh?

42:27.692 --> 42:29.777
Very nice past tense.

42:31.237 --> 42:35.241
I never intended it.
You just made me feel so damn special.

42:36.576 --> 42:38.494
Glad to be of service.

42:41.080 --> 42:42.832
I really like you,

42:44.750 --> 42:47.795
- but I really love my husband.
- I know.

42:51.716 --> 42:54.009
I just wanted to say goodbye.

42:56.554 --> 43:00.850
I had a visitor from the better part
of my conscience this morning.

43:01.225 --> 43:05.646
He made me realize I couldn't break
into your family even if I wanted to.

43:05.729 --> 43:06.939
Yeah.

43:07.148 --> 43:10.401
Well, I'm headed off
to an assignment in Canada.

43:13.654 --> 43:16.824
It's real healthy here
for transplanted growth.

43:18.409 --> 43:20.744
You and Jim will do just fine.

43:27.167 --> 43:28.335
Glen.

43:32.631 --> 43:33.882
Thanks.

43:49.022 --> 43:51.567
That slimeball has the nerve
to come over here?

43:51.650 --> 43:53.694
Man, Mom having a nooner.

43:53.860 --> 43:56.571
- What's a nooner?
- A nooner, Brenda...

43:57.030 --> 44:00.117
- Well, it ain't food.
- This is unreal.

44:00.325 --> 44:02.369
Brandon, I don't want Mom and Dad
to be over.

44:02.452 --> 44:03.996
Sleazemeister.

44:09.751 --> 44:13.046
Just want you to know
that you're a great family.

44:13.505 --> 44:16.049
You all really work well together.

44:39.614 --> 44:42.659
I am so damn glad to see you two.

44:47.414 --> 44:51.876
<i>So what do you think for my new article,

44:52.085 --> 44:54.671
<i>or How to Respect Your Better Half?</i>

44:55.213 --> 44:57.674
I'm so respectful of that, Brandon dear.

44:58.174 --> 44:59.676
Are you okay?

45:00.760 --> 45:02.136
- Hey, guy.
- Hey, Dad.

45:02.220 --> 45:03.429
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi.

45:03.513 --> 45:05.807
Are you okay? It's so early.

45:05.890 --> 45:08.184
Actually, I'm just waking up.

45:08.601 --> 45:09.852
Listen, Jim, I've gotta...

45:09.936 --> 45:11.688
- Just pack your bags.
- Bags?

45:11.771 --> 45:13.648
Kids, you're all right for one night, okay?

45:13.731 --> 45:14.899
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

45:14.983 --> 45:18.528
Your Mom and I are going
for our third try on our anniversary.

45:19.821 --> 45:21.698
Third time's a charm.

45:24.617 --> 45:27.787
- Listen, Jim, things happened.
- You love me?

45:27.870 --> 45:30.581
- Oh, yeah.
- That's all I need to hear.

45:31.707 --> 45:33.501
Where are we going?

45:34.377 --> 45:37.046
That was the most romantic thing ever.

Oh, and I respect your respect.

45:46.138 --> 45:48.933
Well, I respect your respect
of my respect of yours.

45:49.016 --> 45:51.936
