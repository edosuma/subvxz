00:06.549 --> 00:08.634
Previously on
Star Trek: Picard...

00:09.176 --> 00:11.262
For a relic, you're in excellent shape.

00:11.345 --> 00:15.307
Just that little abnormality
in the parietal lobe.

00:16.559 --> 00:18.686
Index, identify this painting.

00:18.769 --> 00:21.689
This painting is called Daughter.

00:22.231 --> 00:25.860
Maddox's theory was Data's entire code,
even his memories,

00:25.943 --> 00:28.487
could be reconstituted
from a single positronic neuron.

00:28.571 --> 00:33.451
You are something
lovingly and deliberately created.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.578
You're telling me that I'm not real.

00:35.661 --> 00:37.496
Which sister are you?

00:37.580 --> 00:39.790
The heart of the Zhat Vash mission

00:39.874 --> 00:45.171
was hate and fear and pure loathing
for any form of synthetic life.

00:45.671 --> 00:47.047
I know who you are.

00:47.131 --> 00:48.549
You are the Destroyer!

00:49.049 --> 00:50.718
Thank you, Will,

00:50.801 --> 00:53.596
for not trying to talk me out of all this.

00:53.679 --> 00:55.097
Believe me, I know better.

00:55.181 --> 01:00.853
The Romulans send in a mole,
a half-Romulan Vulcan named Oh.

01:00.936 --> 01:03.397
I will take care of Picard.

01:03.481 --> 01:06.734
Nine years ago,
a Starfleet vessel had first contact

01:06.817 --> 01:09.570
with a pair of emissaries
from a strange new world.

01:09.653 --> 01:14.408
And the Zhat Vash have been searching
for this world ever since.

01:14.492 --> 01:16.285
Which they have now found because of me.

01:17.495 --> 01:19.997
Ghulion system, fourth planet.

01:21.999 --> 01:23.125
I'm home.

01:23.209 --> 01:24.293
Welcome, all of you.

01:24.376 --> 01:26.420
Doctor Altan Inigo Soong.

01:26.504 --> 01:28.214
I take it my face looks familiar?

01:28.297 --> 01:31.759
I'm just trying to understand
the logic of sacrifice.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.220
I don't like the sound of that.

01:38.390 --> 01:42.561
Starfleet Command,
I have a first contact situation.

01:42.645 --> 01:44.980
The Federation will listen to me.

01:45.064 --> 01:48.442
They didn't listen to him
after the attack on Mars.

01:48.526 --> 01:49.836
And they're not going to believe him now.

01:49.860 --> 01:51.779
My mind to your mind.

01:51.862 --> 01:53.447
My thoughts to your thoughts.

01:56.534 --> 01:57.618
Fascinating.

01:57.701 --> 02:00.204
There are some sort of
higher synthetic beings out there.

02:00.287 --> 02:03.707
Doctor Soong and I have designed
a suitable beacon to summon them.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.251
To them, we're monsters.

02:05.334 --> 02:07.461
A mother would die for her children.

02:07.545 --> 02:09.380
- Would you?
- Yes.

02:09.463 --> 02:12.591
Their purpose
is to seek out advanced synthetic life

02:12.675 --> 02:15.803
and excise it
from the oppression by organics.

02:15.886 --> 02:19.431
- You will become the Destroyer after all.
- Take him away.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.768
Would the xBs be better off dead?

03:07.354 --> 03:09.565
Everyone hates them. They have no home.

03:10.482 --> 03:11.609
They don't belong anywhere.

03:12.359 --> 03:13.485
Am I better off dead?

03:16.488 --> 03:17.907
I'm an xB.

03:17.990 --> 03:20.034
I have no home. I don't belong anywhere.

03:22.453 --> 03:25.539
Why don't I just put a phaser to my head
and get it over with?

03:26.582 --> 03:27.666
Because...

03:28.834 --> 03:30.044
I'd miss you.

04:11.710 --> 04:12.878
Well...

04:14.588 --> 04:16.428
- Have you found them?
- Yes, they're all here.

04:17.591 --> 04:18.801
Have you fucked any of them?

04:18.884 --> 04:19.969
Mm. Not yet.

04:20.052 --> 04:21.470
- Killed any?
- One.

04:23.222 --> 04:24.890
Well, I call that progress.

04:26.642 --> 04:28.185
Come see my hiding place.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.522
Oceanfront, crashing waves.

04:31.981 --> 04:33.107
You'll love it.

05:02.594 --> 05:04.138
Lucky you.

05:16.025 --> 05:18.027
I just wanted to see
if you were okay.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.904
I will be when I'm set free.

05:21.447 --> 05:25.117
Picard, try to see this
from our point of view.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.454
You choose if we live.
You choose if we die.

05:28.871 --> 05:30.122
You choose.

05:30.205 --> 05:31.915
We have no choice.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.585
You organics have never given us one.

05:38.088 --> 05:44.094
To say you have no choice
is a failure of imagination.

05:45.262 --> 05:47.097
Please,

05:47.181 --> 05:51.977
don't let the Romulans
turn you into the monsters they fear.

05:52.061 --> 05:53.937
Stop them, Soji.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.773
Stop building that beacon.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.649
Shut it down now.

05:57.733 --> 06:02.321
The beings you are attempting to summon
may well be your salvation...

06:03.322 --> 06:06.325
but they will be our annihilation.

07:55.767 --> 08:00.272
You're telling me you want to use
those grenades to destroy flowers?

08:01.899 --> 08:04.193
Ship-killing flowers that fly.

08:04.693 --> 08:06.111
No, not this time.

08:06.195 --> 08:08.131
I made my way out of the nest.
I can make my way back in.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.657
You have to stay here
and bring the weapon systems online.

08:11.325 --> 08:13.327
Our parents died for this, Narek.

08:14.328 --> 08:15.787
Many more gave their lives.

08:15.871 --> 08:18.207
I found her, Narissa.

08:18.290 --> 08:21.793
Me. The family disgrace.
The Zhat Vash washout.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.130
I found Seb-Cheneb.

08:31.261 --> 08:32.346
Well, go on then.

08:33.889 --> 08:35.599
I have my work to do.

09:08.966 --> 09:11.969
Honestly, I'm a little afraid of it.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.307
Like if I use it too much, it's gonna...

09:18.684 --> 09:19.768
eat my soul.

09:19.851 --> 09:22.396
Well, luckily,
you don't have a soul, so...

09:26.441 --> 09:28.777
But what does it do? How do I even...

09:28.860 --> 09:33.156
Well, when Saga gave it to me, she said,
"You have to use your imagination."

09:33.240 --> 09:34.908
- Oh, she said that, did she?
- Mm-hmm.

09:35.617 --> 09:37.053
Well, I don't have one of those either.

09:37.077 --> 09:40.831
Okay, well, Chris, this is your ship.
You know what's wrong with it.

09:41.707 --> 09:43.083
It's not too complicated.

09:44.126 --> 09:49.047
The intermix reactor is fused.
I need to un-fuse it, which is impossible.

09:49.715 --> 09:52.384
I need to replace it,
but the maintenance replicator is off-line

09:52.467 --> 09:56.471
because the intermix reactor is fused.

09:56.555 --> 09:59.308
Mm. Well, just, you know, give it a try.

10:01.810 --> 10:03.186
Okay, fine, I'll do it.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.980
I got a lot of imagination.

10:05.063 --> 10:06.940
To you, everything's a hammer, or...

10:07.024 --> 10:08.692
No. I'll do it.

10:16.325 --> 10:19.536
There's... There's no kind of
trigger or... or switch.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.371
Hmm.

10:21.455 --> 10:25.542
Well, maybe what she meant
was you have to imagine the fix.

10:26.293 --> 10:29.046
Have you been,
um, hitting the horgl again?

10:30.422 --> 10:33.300
Visualize that it's no longer fused.

10:33.383 --> 10:36.178
You know, see the hole patching itself.

10:45.354 --> 10:46.521
Whoa.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.694
Uh... What's happening?

10:56.198 --> 10:57.657
Nothing that makes any sense.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.752
- Say it.
- Say what?

11:08.835 --> 11:10.796
Hmm, those three beautiful words.

11:13.632 --> 11:15.384
- You were right.
- Hmm. Just one more time.

11:15.467 --> 11:16.468
Piss off.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.014
I know that sound.

11:30.399 --> 11:34.569
All of Bruce's work on the downloading
of consciousness into a synthetic body

11:34.653 --> 11:35.987
should be on that machine.

11:36.071 --> 11:37.572
Let's hope so.

11:37.656 --> 11:38.949
We don't have much time.

11:40.951 --> 11:41.952
You know...

11:43.537 --> 11:48.333
this really is a remarkable act
of self-sacrifice on your part.

11:50.252 --> 11:53.046
But I suppose
that's what mothers do, isn't it?

12:00.554 --> 12:01.763
It's okay.

12:01.847 --> 12:04.141
It'll be okay. You can do this.

12:04.766 --> 12:06.101
You have to do this.

12:10.188 --> 12:12.315
I'm not their mother, asshole.

12:13.316 --> 12:14.943
Someone's throwing rocks at my ship.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.864
- The abusive Romulan boyfriend.
- Comms.

12:20.031 --> 12:21.366
Go ahead, throw it.

12:21.450 --> 12:23.994
I want to see what a photon torpedo
can do at this range.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.371
I have 12 wide-dispersion

12:26.455 --> 12:28.665
molecular solvent grenade canisters.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.627
I'm throwing rocks.

12:32.711 --> 12:34.004
What do you want?

12:34.087 --> 12:36.607
And don't think we won't kick your ass,
dirtbag, because we will.

12:36.631 --> 12:37.632
Raff.

12:38.633 --> 12:40.033
What are you doing here, Snakehead?

12:40.552 --> 12:41.970
Trying to save the universe.

12:43.388 --> 12:46.183
We can keep fighting,
or we can work together.

12:46.808 --> 12:48.101
Stop what's coming for us.

12:49.311 --> 12:50.353
It's your call.

12:56.193 --> 12:57.194
JL.

12:58.487 --> 12:59.946
JL, come in.

13:01.239 --> 13:02.240
Damn it.

13:02.824 --> 13:05.035
They are building
some kind of transmitter.

13:05.619 --> 13:08.121
They are signaling something to come here.

13:08.205 --> 13:09.581
To do what?

13:09.664 --> 13:13.084
We believe synthetics are fated
to destroy all organic life.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.128
We call it Ganmadan.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.339
The place is on lockdown.

13:17.422 --> 13:20.302
Whatever that transmitter is, they don't
want anyone interfering with it.

13:21.510 --> 13:23.386
- The thing about Picard is...
- Yeah.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.597
Interfering is definitely his thing.

13:25.680 --> 13:26.681
Try him again.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.184
JL, come in.

13:30.727 --> 13:33.271
Admiral Jean-Luc Picard, retired.

13:34.439 --> 13:36.983
- Damn it.
- I've told you. They won't respond.

13:37.067 --> 13:38.860
The synthetics have jammed all comms.

13:41.613 --> 13:43.031
- Whoa, whoa.
- Whoa, whoa.

13:44.866 --> 13:46.076
I do.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.744
I very much choose to live.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.913
Hold up, kid.
We disarmed him, searched him.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.707
We may very well have a common enemy
coming for us.

13:52.791 --> 13:55.752
You're gonna wanna hear
what he came here to say.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.597
Altan, I...

14:09.099 --> 14:10.141
What are you doing?

14:10.225 --> 14:15.230
I'm transferring Saga's memories
into a V-module as a memento for Arcana.

14:15.730 --> 14:19.276
But the damage to her optical processors
corrupted the data stream and...

14:20.986 --> 14:22.237
Do you need something?

14:22.779 --> 14:26.199
Yes. I've been working on the neural lace
for your golem,

14:26.283 --> 14:28.326
but some of the files are encrypted.

14:28.410 --> 14:31.955
Bruce always said
that your crypto kung fu was the best.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.331
Oh.

14:34.249 --> 14:36.835
Okay,
I'll see if I can get into those files.

14:36.918 --> 14:38.503
Keep an eye on the transcoding rate.

14:39.129 --> 14:40.130
Got it.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.405
Sorry.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.950
I still don't understand
why we're trusting him.

15:09.034 --> 15:10.994
His sister murdered Hugh.

15:14.039 --> 15:15.559
Good thing she didn't come along then.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.168
I don't like you.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.252
No?

15:19.669 --> 15:21.004
How do you feel about Ganmadan?

15:21.087 --> 15:23.816
Because if we waste any more time
fighting each other, we will all die.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.901
Then whether or not you like me
will matter even less.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.136
Whoa. H-Hold on.

15:28.219 --> 15:29.929
What is Ganmadan?

15:30.013 --> 15:32.349
- What is the story?
- It's just that.

15:33.725 --> 15:36.019
- A story.
- A story of the end.

15:36.770 --> 15:38.772
- Of?
- Everything.

15:40.023 --> 15:41.941
Like Ragnarök or Judgment Day.

15:43.026 --> 15:44.235
An ancient myth.

15:44.319 --> 15:48.365
Some say it dates back from long before
our ancestors first arrived on Vulcan.

15:48.448 --> 15:51.493
The story of Ganmadan
begins with two sisters.

15:51.576 --> 15:52.577
Twin khalagu.

15:52.661 --> 15:53.745
Demons.

15:55.497 --> 15:57.457
Twin demons who come at the end of time

15:57.540 --> 15:59.459
to open the way
and unleash the ch'khalagu.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.086
Very bad demons.

16:01.169 --> 16:03.755
One sister is called Seb-Natan,
the foreteller.

16:04.297 --> 16:07.342
She plays a drum
made from the skin of children.

16:08.176 --> 16:12.347
She strikes it with a chain of skulls
so hard and so long

16:12.430 --> 16:14.307
that her heart bursts from the effort.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.563
- The other sister is called Seb...
- Seb-Cheneb?

16:20.647 --> 16:22.649
Yes. We... We know about her.

16:22.732 --> 16:26.027
So you know that she carries a horn from
a great pale hellbeast called Ganmadan?

16:27.737 --> 16:29.948
You know when she blows a blast
on the horn,

16:30.031 --> 16:31.741
it will unleash all the ch'khalagu

16:31.825 --> 16:33.868
who have been waiting
since the beginning of time.

16:34.536 --> 16:36.079
You know the sky will crack,

16:36.162 --> 16:40.041
and through the crack in the sky,
the ch'khalagu will come ravening.

16:40.125 --> 16:42.544
You know about the Thousand Days of Pain.

16:43.002 --> 16:46.840
You know the streets will be slick
with entrails of half-devoured corpses.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.175
You know the worlds will burn.

16:49.968 --> 16:54.723
And the ch'khalagu will feast
and nurse their brats on blood

16:54.806 --> 16:56.725
and pick their teeth with bones.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.519
No, we did not know any of that.

16:59.602 --> 17:04.649
But, I mean, do you really...
You really believe this is a, a prophecy?

17:04.733 --> 17:05.734
No.

17:07.193 --> 17:08.653
I believe it's history.

17:08.737 --> 17:09.946
Oh.

17:11.740 --> 17:13.908
And the fascinating thing
about history is...

17:15.618 --> 17:17.328
it always repeats itself.

17:38.933 --> 17:42.854
At last,
our great work is nearly at an end.

17:50.111 --> 17:52.322
Molecular solvent grenades.

17:52.405 --> 17:55.366
Short fuse. Push button, throw.

17:55.450 --> 17:57.535
Intended for those orchids,

17:57.619 --> 17:59.788
but now the transmitter
is our target of opportunity.

17:59.871 --> 18:01.706
Okay. H-Hold on. Hold on.

18:01.790 --> 18:05.794
How exactly are we planning
on getting ourselves back into Synthville?

18:05.877 --> 18:07.462
We walk in the front door.

18:11.549 --> 18:13.551
Oh, hey. Hi.

18:13.635 --> 18:14.969
How are we gonna do that?

18:15.053 --> 18:18.139
By bringing them the Romulan secret agent
that killed their beloved Saga.

18:20.975 --> 18:22.477
I still don't like you.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.062
Check it out, you guys.

18:24.145 --> 18:25.905
Look who we found
sneaking around last night.

18:26.564 --> 18:28.024
Thought you might want him back.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.610
So, how are we gonna
blow the transmitter?

18:30.693 --> 18:34.030
A single, concentrated blast.
Remote detonation.

18:34.113 --> 18:37.158
- Sounds like we need a delivery system.
- A drone.

18:37.242 --> 18:38.785
- Your weapons.
- Oh, of course.

18:41.204 --> 18:43.665
The molecular solvent, it's stable?

18:44.290 --> 18:45.375
Until it's detonated.

18:45.458 --> 18:49.921
Except in metal, so the container
needs to be carbon fiber, ceramic.

18:50.421 --> 18:52.131
- Bags.
- Oh, certainly.

18:52.590 --> 18:53.591
You bet.

18:54.092 --> 18:56.070
And with the transporter block
the synths have in place,

18:56.094 --> 18:57.804
we can't beam anything in or out.

18:57.887 --> 18:59.514
So, we'll need a way to conceal it.

19:06.980 --> 19:07.897
Do you play?

19:07.981 --> 19:10.191
Oh, I love the game.

19:10.733 --> 19:11.734
All right. Let's go.

19:12.360 --> 19:13.361
Thanks.

19:21.452 --> 19:22.745
Picard?

19:23.621 --> 19:25.248
Admiral Picard.

19:25.331 --> 19:27.542
- Hello. Are you...
- Still here.

19:28.209 --> 19:29.210
Okay.

19:29.294 --> 19:30.795
They're about to power up the beacon.

19:31.421 --> 19:32.422
We have to hurry.

19:33.798 --> 19:34.841
What is this?

19:34.924 --> 19:36.301
I'm busting you out.

19:38.553 --> 19:40.614
I honestly thought
I was the worst secret agent ever,

19:40.638 --> 19:42.366
but I'm starting to believe
I may have a gift.

19:42.390 --> 19:45.268
- Uh, where are we going?
- Back to La Sirena.

19:45.351 --> 19:48.021
Come on. We've gotta move
while they're still distracted.

19:49.230 --> 19:53.943
Synthetic matrix
complete. Ready to receive neural engrams.

19:54.027 --> 19:55.028
Yeah.

20:18.718 --> 20:19.844
Tower's almost active.

20:19.928 --> 20:22.698
We need to get a clear line of sight
on the superluminal tuner at the base.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.891
How are we gonna get up there
without being seen?

20:24.974 --> 20:26.476
An excellent question.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.815
I guess they went looking for us?

20:32.899 --> 20:34.609
We'll worry about that later.

20:34.692 --> 20:36.319
Status report on the Romulans.

20:36.819 --> 20:37.987
Come on, Doctor.

20:41.908 --> 20:44.285
The attack wing is seven minutes
from planetfall.

20:44.369 --> 20:45.620
Any sign of Starfleet?

20:46.579 --> 20:50.041
No, but even if your message got through,
they'd still be behind the Romulans.

20:50.124 --> 20:53.127
We've got to find a way
to stall them somehow.

20:53.211 --> 20:55.672
And, of course,
hope that the Federation arrives.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.131
Yeah, and then?

20:57.215 --> 21:00.093
I mean, say we do find a way
to hold off the Romulans.

21:00.176 --> 21:01.302
We save Soji.

21:01.386 --> 21:04.389
Now, she and the golden children
are free to call up the über-synths

21:04.472 --> 21:07.976
and then, vapor and ash,
a galactic-level biocidal event.

21:08.059 --> 21:09.894
Well, clearly, we've got to stop them too!

21:09.978 --> 21:13.523
They've left us behind, Picard.
They're generations beyond us.

21:13.982 --> 21:19.278
In one sense, yes, but in another,
as you said, they are children.

21:19.362 --> 21:22.824
And until now the only teachers
that they've had are a couple of hermits

21:22.907 --> 21:25.410
and the fear of extermination.

21:25.493 --> 21:27.912
But fear is an incompetent teacher.

21:28.705 --> 21:34.085
Yes, they have life, but no one
is teaching them what it's for.

21:34.168 --> 21:38.715
To be alive is a responsibility
as well as a right.

21:38.798 --> 21:42.969
How are they supposed to learn that lesson
in six minutes and 11 seconds?

21:43.803 --> 21:45.722
The way that children learn most things.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.059
By example.

21:51.269 --> 21:56.190
Now, let's see how closely
I was watching Rios.

22:05.241 --> 22:06.576
All right.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.037
Make it so.

22:24.343 --> 22:25.887
Brothers and sisters,

22:25.970 --> 22:29.932
as soon as the beacon is at full capacity,
we will begin transmitting.

22:30.016 --> 22:32.310
And once the signal is received,
a portal will open,

22:32.393 --> 22:36.147
and our liberators
will be here nearly instantaneously.

22:36.230 --> 22:38.024
And then we'll be free.

22:40.568 --> 22:41.652
Watch them.

22:52.789 --> 22:54.332
I wanted to return this to you.

22:56.667 --> 23:00.088
You reasoned correctly that
your fellow synthetics needed persuading.

23:00.171 --> 23:02.131
An emotional jolt

23:02.215 --> 23:05.134
to drive them to the decision
you wanted them to make.

23:05.218 --> 23:06.594
To build the beacon.

23:06.677 --> 23:09.388
I'm glad you see
the reason behind my actions.

23:09.889 --> 23:10.890
I do...

23:12.725 --> 23:14.352
but reason isn't everything.

23:14.977 --> 23:17.522
How could you help
that Romulan kill your sister?

23:17.605 --> 23:19.857
I thought I taught you better than this.

23:22.985 --> 23:24.112
Turns out...

23:25.780 --> 23:27.406
you're no better than we are.

23:43.548 --> 23:46.300
Come on. Move, hija, move.

23:48.553 --> 23:52.557
So, how do we hold off 218 warbirds
till Starfleet gets here?

23:53.099 --> 23:54.267
If they get here.

23:57.019 --> 23:59.063
Are you not answering
to build suspense, or...

23:59.647 --> 24:03.442
At the present moment, Doctor Jurati,
I'm trying to pilot a starship

24:03.526 --> 24:05.862
for the first time in a very long time

24:05.945 --> 24:08.906
without exploding or crashing!

24:08.990 --> 24:10.741
If that is all right with you.

24:10.825 --> 24:12.326
Nope, totally. Good call.

24:12.410 --> 24:14.537
One impossible thing at a time.

24:23.421 --> 24:26.465
Soji, please. You don't have to do this.

24:26.549 --> 24:28.718
Soji, please!

24:28.801 --> 24:30.511
You're making a mistake.

24:48.279 --> 24:49.363
Soji!

24:55.494 --> 24:58.956
Launch detected.
Attempting to acquire weapons lock.

25:01.876 --> 25:03.211
Drop your weapon.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.463
Over the edge.

25:07.715 --> 25:09.175
Step away from the console.

25:11.636 --> 25:13.471
I'm unarmed.

25:13.554 --> 25:15.097
I seriously doubt that.

25:16.557 --> 25:17.934
You know, you're rather pretty,

25:18.684 --> 25:22.563
or would be
if you weren't a disgusting half-meat.

25:35.243 --> 25:36.702
Incoming warp signatures.

25:36.786 --> 25:38.788
Wouldn't happen to be Starfleet, would it?

25:47.380 --> 25:50.591
General, they appear
to be concentrated in one settlement.

25:50.675 --> 25:53.302
Sterilize the entire planet.

26:09.986 --> 26:11.070
Here come the orchids.

26:11.153 --> 26:13.739
Let's see how much time they can buy us.

26:40.850 --> 26:43.311
Sad Queen Annika,

26:43.394 --> 26:46.731
six years old, and all she got
for her birthday was assimilated.

26:58.492 --> 27:01.620
Why didn't you just put a phaser
to your head and get it over with?

27:01.704 --> 27:03.497
Because I still had this to live for.

27:04.498 --> 27:06.542
This... is for Hugh.

27:31.984 --> 27:34.195
Now might be a good time
to reveal the secret plan.

27:36.072 --> 27:37.531
Once these orchids have had it,

27:37.615 --> 27:40.409
there will still be 200 Romulan warships
and only one of us.

27:40.993 --> 27:44.033
If you figure out a way to get us out
of this one, they'll name it after you.

27:44.080 --> 27:45.247
Picard maneuver.

27:45.748 --> 27:48.167
Wait, no.
No, that's actually a thing, isn't it?

27:50.002 --> 27:52.755
You made it look like the Enterprise
was in two places at once.

27:53.214 --> 27:55.841
It was the Stargazer,
and it was a long time ago.

27:55.925 --> 27:58.636
It would be useless
against so many enemy vessels.

28:03.557 --> 28:05.851
We'd have to multiply the sensor images

28:05.935 --> 28:08.479
and then find some way to disperse them,

28:08.562 --> 28:11.857
like an ancient warplane
scattering bits of mirror

28:11.941 --> 28:13.651
to overwhelm a radar system.

28:13.734 --> 28:15.736
Yeah, how the hell would we do that?

28:15.820 --> 28:19.115
If only we had some kinda
wacky fundamental field replicator

28:19.198 --> 28:20.825
with a neuro-atomic interface.

28:22.451 --> 28:23.702
Like this.

28:33.504 --> 28:34.672
Picard, what are you doing?

28:34.755 --> 28:38.342
Soji, I want you to reconsider
your present course of action

28:38.426 --> 28:39.677
and power down the beacon.

28:39.760 --> 28:41.554
You know that's not going to happen.

28:41.637 --> 28:45.141
I have something I want to give you
and your people,

28:45.224 --> 28:48.769
and I hope it will change your mind.

28:50.813 --> 28:52.481
And what's that?

28:53.691 --> 28:54.817
My life.

28:54.900 --> 28:55.901
Picard out.

29:10.708 --> 29:12.877
Orbital defenses neutralized, General.

29:13.461 --> 29:17.965
All ships, target the abominations' nest.

29:22.470 --> 29:23.762
Ready.

29:23.846 --> 29:25.723
And they'll all have warp signatures?

29:26.390 --> 29:27.683
On my mark.

29:33.564 --> 29:35.441
What is that?

29:35.524 --> 29:37.526
Unknown vessel. Scanning now.

29:40.821 --> 29:41.989
Ignore it.

29:42.656 --> 29:46.368
Ready planetary sterilization pattern
number five.

29:47.077 --> 29:49.371
Agnes, now. Now, now!

29:58.130 --> 29:59.840
General, there are hundreds of them.

29:59.924 --> 30:01.592
Reposition disruptors.

30:01.675 --> 30:03.177
Engage them.

30:19.193 --> 30:20.277
No!

30:37.378 --> 30:39.088
Picard, are you all right?

30:41.549 --> 30:42.550
No.

31:02.570 --> 31:03.946
They have activated the beacon.

31:04.029 --> 31:06.615
Resume sterilization targeting pattern.

31:09.827 --> 31:11.495
On my command.

31:26.385 --> 31:27.553
They're here.

31:28.304 --> 31:29.555
Admiral, you did it.

31:31.849 --> 31:34.059
General, their flagship is hailing us.

31:35.060 --> 31:38.147
Acting Captain Will Riker
in command of the USS Zheng He.

31:38.230 --> 31:39.231
And?

31:39.315 --> 31:42.443
And it is my duty to inform you
that the United Federation of Planets

31:42.526 --> 31:45.571
has designated planet Ghulion IV
in the Vayt sector

31:45.654 --> 31:48.282
as under the protection of Starfleet,

31:48.365 --> 31:50.701
according to the terms
of the Treaty of Algeron.

31:50.784 --> 31:51.785
Too late.

31:51.869 --> 31:54.580
Our claim to this world takes precedence.

31:54.663 --> 31:56.415
- Move aside.
- Afraid not.

31:56.498 --> 32:01.045
I have a priority request
to open diplomatic negotiations

32:01.128 --> 32:05.132
and protection
for the inhabitants of Ghulion IV.

32:05.215 --> 32:08.427
General or Commodore,
or whatever you're calling yourself,

32:08.510 --> 32:10.554
right now, I'm on the bridge
of the toughest,

32:10.638 --> 32:14.892
fastest, most powerful ship
Starfleet has ever put into service.

32:14.975 --> 32:17.102
And I've got a fleet of them at my back.

32:17.186 --> 32:19.313
We've got our phasers locked
on your warp cores.

32:19.396 --> 32:21.857
And nothing would make me happier

32:21.940 --> 32:26.737
than you giving me an excuse
to kick your treacherous Tal Shiar ass.

32:27.363 --> 32:28.364
But instead,

32:29.073 --> 32:31.075
I'm going to ask you one time...

32:31.950 --> 32:33.619
to stand down.

32:36.372 --> 32:37.998
General, your orders?

32:38.582 --> 32:41.043
Retarget weapons systems.

32:41.126 --> 32:42.920
Prepare to fight.

32:55.724 --> 32:58.185
Weapons hot, deflectors to full.

33:09.571 --> 33:10.614
Picard.

33:18.622 --> 33:19.623
I know.

33:40.436 --> 33:43.063
I have to speak with Soji.

33:44.064 --> 33:45.441
On an open channel.

33:45.983 --> 33:47.359
You're in no shape.

33:47.443 --> 33:51.739
Get me some poly-synephrine, 20cc...

33:51.822 --> 33:55.701
- No. I...
- It will only hasten the inevitable.

33:57.161 --> 33:58.537
Do it.

34:10.507 --> 34:12.634
Open the channel. Now.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.472
- Picard...
- Soji.

34:16.555 --> 34:19.349
Please, power down the beacon.

34:22.436 --> 34:26.273
Show them how profoundly wrong
they are about you.

34:26.356 --> 34:27.941
You're not the enemy.

34:28.025 --> 34:29.693
You're not the Destroyer.

34:29.777 --> 34:31.278
If that doesn't convince them,

34:31.361 --> 34:33.447
then they will have to answer
to the Federation.

34:33.530 --> 34:36.909
The same Federation that banned us
and threw us on the scrap heap.

34:36.992 --> 34:39.703
If we wanted to destroy you, Soji,

34:39.787 --> 34:41.556
we would have joined forces
with the Romulans.

34:41.580 --> 34:44.291
We would be training our phasers
on you right now.

34:44.374 --> 34:47.002
We aren't. We won't. You know why?

34:47.085 --> 34:51.340
Because we trust you
to make the right choice.

34:52.132 --> 34:55.302
I trust you, Soji. I know you.

34:56.345 --> 34:57.805
I believe in you.

35:00.891 --> 35:03.477
That's why I saved your lives.

35:03.560 --> 35:07.272
So that you could save ours in return.

35:07.356 --> 35:08.774
That's the whole point.

35:09.274 --> 35:10.651
That's why we're here.

35:12.277 --> 35:13.695
To save each other.

35:48.313 --> 35:50.774
They destroyed the beacon.
What are your orders?

35:56.071 --> 35:58.866
Captain, it looks like
the Romulans are standing down.

35:58.949 --> 36:00.868
Excellent decision.

36:00.951 --> 36:02.160
Stand down from red alert.

36:02.828 --> 36:05.706
Now prepare to be escorted
out of Federation space.

36:05.789 --> 36:07.457
That won't be necessary.

36:08.041 --> 36:09.543
Really, it's no trouble at all.

36:17.968 --> 36:20.095
Will. How the...

36:20.178 --> 36:23.140
When I heard you sent an SOS,
I asked for temporary reassignment.

36:23.223 --> 36:25.684
Just because I didn't try
to talk you out of it

36:25.767 --> 36:27.978
didn't mean I was gonna
let you go it alone.

36:28.896 --> 36:32.524
I'm supposed to sit around in the woods
making pizza while you have all the fun?

36:33.692 --> 36:38.655
Admiral Picard, I leave this situation
in your capable hands.

36:39.907 --> 36:43.535
Thank you, Will,
for always having my back.

36:44.870 --> 36:46.121
I learned from the best.

36:49.166 --> 36:50.375
I've got it from here.

36:50.959 --> 36:53.545
I'll see you around, my friend. Riker out.

37:00.302 --> 37:01.678
Adieu.

37:09.895 --> 37:10.896
Picard?

37:23.075 --> 37:24.076
Doctor.

37:24.159 --> 37:25.619
Picard!

37:26.620 --> 37:27.621
Picard.

37:28.789 --> 37:30.269
Would you like to finish it, Captain?

37:30.332 --> 37:31.708
No.

37:32.417 --> 37:34.962
I don't want the game to end.

37:36.338 --> 37:37.506
Picard!

37:38.006 --> 37:39.758
Goddamn it!

37:41.176 --> 37:42.678
It's all right.

37:42.761 --> 37:45.472
Wait. What's happening?
What's wrong with him?

37:45.555 --> 37:47.307
His brain abnormality. He's failing.

37:47.891 --> 37:50.686
Can't you get him to the med lab
or a sick bay on one of your ships?

37:50.769 --> 37:54.690
There's no point, is there, Doctor?

37:56.900 --> 37:58.068
No.

37:58.151 --> 37:59.820
I'm dropping the transporter block.

37:59.903 --> 38:01.571
I'll beam you guys right here.

38:09.830 --> 38:12.416
- No.
- It's all right. It's all right.

38:12.499 --> 38:15.502
- No.
- No. What did you just do?

38:17.004 --> 38:18.880
I gave you a choice.

38:19.423 --> 38:23.552
Not being the Destroyer was up to you.

38:24.678 --> 38:26.263
It always was.

38:38.025 --> 38:39.651
Elnor.

38:58.545 --> 39:01.715
- Raffi?
- Yes, JL. I'm right here.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.843
You were quite right.

39:05.594 --> 39:07.012
About what, JL?

40:01.608 --> 40:02.859
You heard?

40:03.568 --> 40:04.653
Just now.

40:06.988 --> 40:09.324
Oh. It's what passes for alcohol here.

40:11.284 --> 40:13.203
I really don't recommend it.

40:23.380 --> 40:26.883
I said I would never do it again,
and then I fucking did it again.

40:28.552 --> 40:29.594
Same.

40:32.264 --> 40:33.390
Never again do what?

40:33.473 --> 40:34.766
Oh.

40:39.437 --> 40:40.897
So many things.

40:41.523 --> 40:45.193
But, in this instance, never again...

40:46.695 --> 40:49.281
kill somebody
just because it's what they deserve.

40:51.658 --> 40:55.787
Just because it feels wrong
for them to still be alive.

41:00.333 --> 41:01.668
You?

41:08.466 --> 41:12.470
Never again let another self-righteous,
hard-assed old starship captain

41:12.554 --> 41:13.847
into my heart.

41:23.607 --> 41:25.901
Never again have to stand there
and watch him die.

41:28.069 --> 41:30.739
Was there anything
you could've done to prevent it?

41:36.119 --> 41:37.746
No, I guess there wasn't.

41:39.331 --> 41:41.333
Hmm. Then I win.

42:40.058 --> 42:41.643
It's okay.

42:41.726 --> 42:45.188
It's okay. You let it all out.

42:45.272 --> 42:46.523
You cry.

42:48.108 --> 42:49.234
I got you.

43:19.222 --> 43:21.933
Another damn dream.

43:23.226 --> 43:24.269
No, Captain.

43:26.187 --> 43:29.065
It is a massively complex
quantum simulation.

43:30.608 --> 43:34.404
I would imagine, however,
from your point of view,

43:34.487 --> 43:36.406
hearing me say so
would not be out of place

43:36.489 --> 43:38.366
in a dream you might have about me.

43:40.327 --> 43:43.788
If you ever have dreams about me.

43:43.872 --> 43:45.999
I dream about you all the time.

43:47.083 --> 43:48.251
Interesting.

43:49.169 --> 43:51.588
Are you wearing the clothes
you had on when you died?

43:58.136 --> 43:59.304
Data...

44:00.889 --> 44:01.973
am I dead?

44:03.725 --> 44:04.726
Yes, Captain.

44:07.771 --> 44:09.397
Do you remember dying?

44:10.398 --> 44:11.608
I think I do.

44:12.275 --> 44:18.907
Something in my head
seemed to just go away,

44:19.366 --> 44:22.118
like a child's sandcastle collapsing.

44:22.202 --> 44:23.203
Hmm.

44:24.454 --> 44:28.666
I'm aware that I was killed in 2379,

44:29.542 --> 44:31.669
but I have no memory of my death.

44:32.087 --> 44:37.217
My consciousness exists in a massively
complex quantum reconstruction

44:37.300 --> 44:42.055
made from a copy of the memories
I downloaded into B-4 just before I died.

44:42.889 --> 44:45.934
You don't remember your death.
I can't forget it.

44:47.060 --> 44:51.898
Apparently, I ended my existence
in the hope of prolonging yours.

44:51.981 --> 44:52.982
That's right.

44:53.066 --> 44:56.736
Before I had even grasped
the nature of our predicament,

44:56.820 --> 44:59.197
you had conceived and executed it.

44:59.280 --> 45:00.323
I was furious!

45:00.407 --> 45:01.825
My apologies, Captain.

45:02.909 --> 45:05.036
But I'm not certain
I could've done otherwise.

45:05.120 --> 45:06.371
True.

45:06.454 --> 45:09.541
That might have been
the most Data thing you ever did.

45:10.542 --> 45:14.963
I've always wished
that I could've said I was sorry

45:15.046 --> 45:17.465
that it was you and not me.

45:19.551 --> 45:20.927
Captain.

45:22.011 --> 45:25.640
Do you regret sacrificing your life
for Soji and her people?

45:25.723 --> 45:26.891
Not for an instant.

45:26.975 --> 45:31.187
Then why would you imagine
I regret sacrificing mine for yours?

45:32.480 --> 45:33.481
Ah.

45:34.441 --> 45:37.944
Did you say all this was a simulation?

45:38.027 --> 45:40.947
Yes, sir.
An extremely sophisticated one.

45:41.030 --> 45:46.786
My memory engrams were extracted from
a single neuron salvaged by Bruce Maddox,

45:46.870 --> 45:50.832
and then my consciousness
was reconstructed by my brother,

45:50.915 --> 45:52.167
Doctor Altan Soong.

45:52.792 --> 45:54.335
I don't much care for him.

45:54.419 --> 45:55.420
Hmm.

45:56.254 --> 45:58.131
The Soongs can be...

45:59.215 --> 46:02.135
I believe the phrase is,
"an acquired taste."

46:02.218 --> 46:03.344
Mm-hmm.

46:03.428 --> 46:06.347
Well, whatever this is,

46:06.431 --> 46:08.892
it's wonderful to see you, Data.

46:09.559 --> 46:14.606
To see your strange, beautiful face.

46:15.773 --> 46:20.945
Among the many, many things
that I regretted after your death...

46:22.030 --> 46:23.865
was that I never told you...

46:25.700 --> 46:26.993
That you loved me.

46:32.290 --> 46:35.210
Knowing that you loved me forms a small

46:35.293 --> 46:39.172
but statistically significant part
of my memories.

46:40.632 --> 46:42.550
I hope that brings you some comfort, sir.

46:43.301 --> 46:44.802
It does.

46:44.886 --> 46:46.513
Thank you, Data.

46:46.596 --> 46:49.098
Which is why I would like to ask you
to do me a favor.

46:49.682 --> 46:51.267
Of course. Anything.

46:51.351 --> 46:52.519
When you leave...

46:52.602 --> 46:53.770
Leave?

46:56.231 --> 46:57.649
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

46:57.732 --> 46:59.692
I thought this was a simulation.

47:00.276 --> 47:01.319
Yes, sir.

47:01.402 --> 47:02.987
But you are not.

47:04.656 --> 47:06.699
Before your brain functions ceased,

47:06.783 --> 47:10.078
Doctors Soong and Jurati,
with help from Soji,

47:10.161 --> 47:13.206
were able to scan, map and transfer

47:13.289 --> 47:16.125
a complete neural image
of your brain substrates.

47:22.966 --> 47:24.634
Do I have to go?

47:25.301 --> 47:26.469
Yes, Captain.

47:39.023 --> 47:41.025
You wanted me to do you a favor.

47:41.985 --> 47:42.986
Yes, sir.

47:44.070 --> 47:45.863
When you leave,

47:45.947 --> 47:50.410
I would be profoundly grateful
if you terminated my consciousness.

47:53.538 --> 47:55.290
You want to die.

47:57.417 --> 47:59.419
Not exactly, sir.

48:01.421 --> 48:03.881
I want to live, however briefly,

48:04.799 --> 48:06.968
knowing that my life is finite.

48:08.136 --> 48:12.724
Mortality gives meaning
to human life, Captain.

48:13.975 --> 48:15.059
Peace.

48:15.602 --> 48:16.728
Love.

48:16.811 --> 48:18.104
Friendship.

48:18.813 --> 48:20.607
These are precious,

48:20.690 --> 48:24.235
because we know they cannot endure.

48:29.407 --> 48:32.285
A butterfly that lives forever...

48:37.373 --> 48:40.376
is really not a butterfly at all.

48:43.546 --> 48:44.797
Very well.

48:46.716 --> 48:48.968
I will do what you ask.

48:52.972 --> 48:53.973
Thank you, sir.

49:07.528 --> 49:08.738
Goodbye, Commander.

49:10.948 --> 49:12.992
Goodbye, Captain.

49:50.071 --> 49:51.197
Hi, mister.

50:00.081 --> 50:01.499
Am I real?

50:01.582 --> 50:03.334
Of course you are.

50:18.641 --> 50:24.564
Tell me about this body.
This, uh... golem.

50:25.398 --> 50:30.361
Well, it has no augmentations,
no, you know, superpowers.

50:30.445 --> 50:33.614
I knew you wouldn't want to have to adjust
to something new.

50:33.698 --> 50:37.785
Not after 94 years in the same body
with the same face.

50:37.869 --> 50:39.620
Ah. I see.

50:39.704 --> 50:42.790
Everything is new, though.
Everything works.

50:42.874 --> 50:46.544
And the brain abnormality is gone.
For good.

50:48.463 --> 50:50.006
Extraordinary.

50:55.470 --> 50:59.265
You... You haven't made me immortal?

50:59.348 --> 51:01.017
Oh, relax, man.

51:01.100 --> 51:04.729
Everyone was paying attention.
We took care of you.

51:05.521 --> 51:07.815
We designed
a cellular homeostasis algorithm

51:07.899 --> 51:10.318
that should give you, more or less,
the same number of years

51:10.401 --> 51:12.403
you would've expected
without the brain condition.

51:12.487 --> 51:13.488
Ah.

51:14.447 --> 51:16.824
I wouldn't have minded another ten.

51:18.451 --> 51:19.452
Twenty?

51:22.789 --> 51:26.042
Well, Doctor Soong, I must thank you.

51:26.918 --> 51:28.461
My gain is your loss.

51:29.587 --> 51:34.300
But now we both have something to lose.

51:36.803 --> 51:38.387
I have a promise to keep.

51:53.569 --> 51:57.532
It says a great deal
about the mind of Commander Data

51:57.615 --> 52:01.828
that... looking at the human race

52:01.911 --> 52:07.708
with all its violence and corruption
and willful ignorance,

52:07.792 --> 52:11.420
he could still see kindness,

52:11.504 --> 52:15.675
the immense curiosity
and greatness of spirit.

52:16.884 --> 52:20.137
And he wanted, more than anything else,

52:20.972 --> 52:22.765
to be part of that...

52:23.891 --> 52:25.560
to be a part of...

52:27.895 --> 52:29.188
the human family.

52:42.326 --> 52:47.415
"We are such stuff
as dreams are made on...

52:53.921 --> 52:58.843
and our little life is rounded...

53:00.970 --> 53:02.430
with a sleep."

54:06.869 --> 54:08.079
It's time.

54:28.265 --> 54:32.979
Soji... you have endured so much

54:33.479 --> 54:37.775
and traveled so far to find your way home.

54:39.360 --> 54:42.071
Now, you leave it all behind.

54:42.905 --> 54:44.740
I think I'm just more cut out
for wandering.

54:46.325 --> 54:49.954
And now that they've lifted the ban
on synthetics, I'm free to travel.

54:50.037 --> 54:51.038
Hmm.

54:52.540 --> 54:53.541
Me too.

55:05.302 --> 55:06.637
Ready, Admiral?

55:17.481 --> 55:18.566
Engage.
