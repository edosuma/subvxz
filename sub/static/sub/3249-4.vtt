WEBVTT

00:03.040 --> 00:06.039
(BIRDS TWEETING)

00:12.680 --> 00:15.839
(CROWS CAW)

00:23.600 --> 00:25.519
It's a beautiful day.

00:33.160 --> 00:35.239
Hallucinogenic lipstick.

00:37.280 --> 00:39.559
She's here.

01:02.760 --> 01:06.079
(GUN POWERS UP)

01:08.400 --> 01:11.879
(CRACKLING)

01:14.840 --> 01:16.999
Wrong. Wrong.

01:17.080 --> 01:18.959
Bit right, mostly wrong.

01:19.040 --> 01:20.799
I love museums!

01:20.880 --> 01:22.599
Yeah, great(!) Can we go to a planet now?

01:22.680 --> 01:25.799
A big spaceship, Churchill's bunker...?
You promised me a planet next.

01:25.880 --> 01:28.479
Amy, this isn't any old asteroid.
It's the Delerium Archive,

01:28.560 --> 01:32.839
the final resting place of the headless
monks, the biggest museum ever.

01:32.920 --> 01:34.999
You've got a time machine.
What do you need museums for?

01:35.080 --> 01:37.079
Wrong! Very wrong!

01:37.160 --> 01:39.159
Oooh, one of mine. Also one of mine.

01:40.840 --> 01:43.559
Oh, I see. It's how you keep score.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.239
Oh, great, an old box(!)

02:02.360 --> 02:05.759
It's from one of the old starliners.
A Home Box.

02:05.840 --> 02:07.639
What's a Home Box?

02:07.720 --> 02:09.999
Like a black box on a plane,
except it homes.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.719
Anything happens to the ship,

02:11.800 --> 02:15.039
the Home Box flies home
with all the flight data.

02:15.120 --> 02:16.879
So?

02:16.960 --> 02:19.279
The writing, the graffiti -
Old High Gallifreyan.

02:19.360 --> 02:21.839
The lost language of the Time Lords.

02:26.560 --> 02:29.879
There were days, there were many days,

02:30.000 --> 02:35.639
these words could burn stars
and raise up empires, and topple gods.

02:35.720 --> 02:36.679
What does it say?

02:40.520 --> 02:41.999
"Hello, sweetie!"

02:52.360 --> 02:53.759
(ALARM BELL RINGING)

03:10.960 --> 03:12.919
Party's over, Doctor Song.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.999
Why are we doing this?

03:15.120 --> 03:18.879
Cos someone on a spaceship 1 2,000 years
ago is trying to attract my attention.

03:18.960 --> 03:22.079
Let's see if we can get
the security playback working.

03:31.880 --> 03:36.399
The party's over, Doctor Song,
yet still you're on board.

03:36.520 --> 03:43.719
(SHE LAUGHS) Sorry, Alistair.
I needed to see what was in your vault.

03:43.800 --> 03:48.159
Do you all know what's down there?
Any of you?

03:48.240 --> 03:53.919
Because I'll tell you something.
This ship won't reach its destination.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.239
Wait till she runs.
Don't make it look like an execution.

03:59.680 --> 04:03.719
Triple-seven, five, slash,
three, four, nine by ten.

04:03.800 --> 04:08.039
Zero, twelve, slash, acorn.
Oh, and I could do with an air corridor.

04:08.120 --> 04:11.839
- What was that, what did she say?
- Co-ordinates!

04:11.920 --> 04:14.559
Like I said on the dance floor,

04:14.640 --> 04:19.079
you might want to find something
to hang on to!

04:20.000 --> 04:22.119
(BEEPING)

04:39.600 --> 04:41.439
Whoo!

04:49.720 --> 04:50.999
Doctor?

04:51.080 --> 04:53.199
River?

04:53.280 --> 04:54.919
Follow that ship!

05:42.120 --> 05:44.999
They've gone into warp drive.
We're losing them!

05:45.080 --> 05:46.919
- Stay close!
- I'm trying!

05:47.000 --> 05:48.519
Use the stabilisers.

05:48.600 --> 05:50.159
There aren't stabilisers!

05:50.240 --> 05:51.239
The blue switches!

05:51.320 --> 05:53.759
The blue ones don't do anything,
they're just...blue.

05:53.840 --> 05:55.199
Yes, they're blue.

05:55.280 --> 05:58.839
They're the blue stabilisers!

06:02.320 --> 06:04.199
See?

06:05.960 --> 06:09.879
Yeah, well, it's just boring now,
isn't it? They're boring-ers.

06:09.960 --> 06:12.079
They're blue boring-ers.

06:12.160 --> 06:15.079
Doctor, how come she can fly the TARDIS?

06:15.160 --> 06:17.839
You call that flying the TARDIS? Ha!

06:17.920 --> 06:22.239
OK. I've mapped the probability vectors,

06:22.320 --> 06:24.759
done a fold-back on the temporal isometry,

06:24.840 --> 06:27.679
charted the ship to its destination,

06:27.760 --> 06:31.479
and...parked us right alongside.

06:31.560 --> 06:34.399
Parked us? We haven't landed.

06:34.480 --> 06:37.639
Of course we've landed. I just landed her.

06:38.680 --> 06:40.799
But it didn't make the noise.

06:40.880 --> 06:43.679
- What noise?
- You know, the...

06:43.760 --> 06:45.919
(HE IMPERSONATES TARDIS)

06:47.600 --> 06:51.759
It's not supposed to make that noise.
You leave the brakes on.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.639
Yeah, well, it's a brilliant noise.

06:53.720 --> 06:54.959
I love that noise.

06:55.040 --> 06:58.399
Come along, Pond, let's have a look.

06:59.960 --> 07:03.719
- No, wait! Environment checks.
- Oh, yes, sorry! Quite right.

07:03.800 --> 07:05.479
Environment checks.

07:08.240 --> 07:09.279
Nice out.

07:09.360 --> 07:12.279
We're somewhere in the Garn Belt.
There's an atmosphere.

07:12.360 --> 07:13.439
Early indications suggest...

07:13.480 --> 07:16.599
We're on Alfava Metraxis,
the seventh planet of the Dundra System.

07:16.680 --> 07:20.799
Oxygen-rich atmosphere, toxins
in the soft band, 1 1 -hour day, and...

07:21.880 --> 07:24.079
...chances of rain later.

07:24.160 --> 07:26.759
He thinks he's so hot when he does that.

07:26.840 --> 07:28.559
How come you can fly the TARDIS?

07:28.680 --> 07:32.799
- Oh, I had lessons from the very best.
- Well, yeah.

07:32.880 --> 07:36.079
It's a shame you were busy that day.

07:36.160 --> 07:39.519
Right, then, why did they land here?

07:41.160 --> 07:42.679
They didn't land.

07:42.760 --> 07:44.559
Sorry?

07:44.640 --> 07:48.639
You should've checked the Home Box -
it crashed.

07:57.720 --> 08:00.799
Explain! Who is that
and how did she do that museum thing?

08:00.880 --> 08:03.839
It's a long story and I don't know
most of it. Off we go.

08:03.920 --> 08:04.919
- What are you doing?
- Leaving.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.079
She's got where she wants to go,

08:06.160 --> 08:08.559
- let's go where we want to go.
- Are you basically running away?

08:08.640 --> 08:09.559
- Yep.
- Why?

08:09.640 --> 08:11.519
- Cos she's my future.
- Can you run away from that?

08:11.600 --> 08:14.199
I can run away from anything I like.
Time is not the boss of me.

08:14.280 --> 08:17.519
- Hang on, is that a planet out there?
- Yes, of course it's a planet.

08:17.600 --> 08:20.999
You promised me a planet. Five minutes?

08:23.280 --> 08:25.119
- OK, five minutes!
- Yes!

08:25.200 --> 08:28.119
But that's all, cos I'm telling you now,

08:28.200 --> 08:31.599
that woman is not dragging me
into anything!

08:48.520 --> 08:50.239
What caused it to crash? Not me.

08:50.320 --> 08:53.639
Nah, the airlock would've sealed
seconds after you blew it.

08:53.720 --> 08:57.199
According to the Home Box,
the warp engines had a phase-shift.

08:57.280 --> 08:58.519
No survivors.

08:58.600 --> 09:01.039
A phase-shift would have to be sabotage.
I did warn them.

09:01.120 --> 09:03.719
About what?

09:03.800 --> 09:05.799
Well, at least the building was empty.
Aplan temple.

09:05.880 --> 09:08.719
Unoccupied for centuries.

09:10.760 --> 09:12.999
Aren't you going to introduce us?

09:15.560 --> 09:18.159
Amy Pond, Professor River Song.

09:18.240 --> 09:21.879
(GASPS) I'm going to be a professor
some day, am I?

09:21.960 --> 09:24.239
How exciting!

09:24.320 --> 09:26.879
(LAUGHS) Spoilers!

09:26.960 --> 09:29.159
Yeah, but who is she
and how did she do that?

09:29.240 --> 09:31.079
She just left you a note in a museum.

09:31.160 --> 09:33.839
Two things always guaranteed
to turn up in a museum.

09:33.960 --> 09:39.279
The Home Box of category-four starliner
and, sooner or later, him.

09:39.360 --> 09:42.239
- It's how he keeps score.
- I know!

09:42.320 --> 09:44.079
It's hilarious, isn't it?

09:44.160 --> 09:48.359
I'm nobody's taxi service!
I'm not going to be there to catch you

09:48.440 --> 09:52.119
every time you feel like
jumping out of a spaceship.

09:52.200 --> 09:54.359
And you are so wrong.

09:55.680 --> 09:58.999
There's one survivor.

09:59.080 --> 10:02.719
There's a thing in the belly
of that ship that can't ever die.

10:09.080 --> 10:12.079
Now he's listening. You lot in orbit yet?

10:12.160 --> 10:14.319
Yeah, I saw it land.
I'm at the crash site.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.719
Try and home in on my signal.

10:16.800 --> 10:19.879
Doctor, can you sonic me?

10:19.960 --> 10:23.399
I need to boost the signal
so we can use it as a beacon.

10:25.440 --> 10:29.039
Ooh, Doctor! You soniced her(!)

10:29.120 --> 10:31.879
We have a minute. Shall we?

10:31.960 --> 10:34.319
Where are we up to?

10:34.400 --> 10:37.039
- Have we done the Bone Meadows?
- What's the book?

10:37.120 --> 10:38.159
Stay away from it.

10:39.280 --> 10:41.559
- What is it, though?
- Her diary.

10:41.640 --> 10:44.879
- Ourdiary.
- Her past, my...future.

10:46.720 --> 10:50.359
Time travel.
We keep meeting in the wrong order.

11:03.800 --> 11:06.159
You promised me an army, Dr Song.

11:06.240 --> 11:11.919
No. I promised you the equivalent
of an army. This is the Doctor.

11:13.960 --> 11:17.159
Father Octavian, sir. Bishop, second
class. 20 clerics at my command.

11:17.280 --> 11:20.079
The troops are already in the drop ship
and landing shortly.

11:20.160 --> 11:22.839
Dr Song was helping us
with a covert investigation.

11:26.480 --> 11:28.959
Has Dr Song explained
what we're dealing with?

11:29.040 --> 11:34.319
Doctor, what do you know
of the Weeping Angels?

11:36.920 --> 11:40.239
The Angel, as far as we know,
is still trapped in the ship.

11:40.320 --> 11:42.719
Our mission is to get inside
and neutralise it.

11:42.800 --> 11:45.879
We can't get through up top,
we'd be too close to the drives.

11:46.960 --> 11:49.679
According to this, behind the cliff face,

11:49.760 --> 11:53.679
there's a network of catacombs
leading right up to the temple.

11:53.760 --> 11:55.839
We can blow through
the base of the cliffs,

11:55.920 --> 11:58.799
get into the entrance chamber,
then work our way up.

11:58.880 --> 12:00.919
- Oh, good.
- Good, sir?

12:01.000 --> 12:03.799
Catacombs, probably dark ones.
Dark catacombs, great(!)

12:03.880 --> 12:07.239
Technically, I think it's called
a maze of the dead.

12:07.320 --> 12:09.559
You can stop any time you like.

12:09.640 --> 12:12.279
- Father Octavian?
- Excuse me, sir.

12:15.920 --> 12:19.199
You're letting people call you "sir".
You never do that.

12:21.720 --> 12:25.399
So whatever a Weeping Angel is,
it's really bad, yeah?

12:25.480 --> 12:28.119
Now, that's interesting.

12:28.200 --> 12:31.279
You're still here. Which part of "Wait
in the TARDIS till I tell you it's safe"

12:31.400 --> 12:34.679
- was so confusing?
- Ooh, are you all Mr Grumpy Face today?

12:34.760 --> 12:37.759
A Weeping Angel, Amy, is the deadliest,

12:37.840 --> 12:40.919
most powerful, most malevolent
life form evolution has ever produced,

12:41.000 --> 12:42.879
and one is trapped inside that wreckage

12:42.960 --> 12:45.359
and I'm supposed to climb in
with a screwdriver and a torch,

12:45.440 --> 12:47.159
and assuming I survive the radiation,

12:47.240 --> 12:49.319
and the whole ship
doesn't blow up in my face,

12:49.400 --> 12:51.759
do something clever
which I haven't thought of yet.

12:51.840 --> 12:55.119
That's my day, that's what I'm up to.
Any questions?

12:55.200 --> 12:56.599
Is River Song your wife?

12:56.680 --> 13:00.479
Cos she's someone from your future,
and the way she talks to you,

13:00.560 --> 13:03.039
I've never seen anyone do that.

13:03.120 --> 13:05.559
She's kinda like, you know, "Heel, boy!"

13:05.640 --> 13:08.799
She's Mrs Doctor from the future,
isn't she?

13:08.880 --> 13:12.319
- Is she going to be your wife one day?
- Yes.

13:13.800 --> 13:19.679
You're right.
I am definitely Mr Grumpy Face today.

13:19.760 --> 13:21.719
RIVER SONG: Doctor! Doctor!

13:22.840 --> 13:25.039
Oops! Her indoors!

13:25.120 --> 13:26.279
Father Octavian?

13:27.560 --> 13:30.079
Why do they call him "Father"?

13:30.160 --> 13:32.479
He's their bishop, they're his clerics.

13:32.560 --> 13:35.479
It's the 5 1 st century,
the Church has moved on.

13:47.480 --> 13:51.399
What do you think? It's from the
security cameras in the Byzantium vault.

13:51.480 --> 13:54.319
I ripped it when I was on board.
Sorry about the quality.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.679
- It's four seconds. I've put it on loop.
- Yep. It's an Angel.

13:56.800 --> 14:01.439
- Hands covering its face.
- You've encountered the Angels before?

14:01.560 --> 14:04.159
Once, on Earth, a long time ago. But
those were scavengers, barely surviving.

14:04.240 --> 14:06.199
But it's just a statue.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.639
- It's a statue when you see it.
- Where did it come from?

14:08.720 --> 14:11.199
Oh, pulled from the ruins
of Razbahan, end of last century.

14:11.280 --> 14:14.399
It's been in private hands ever since,
dormant all that time.

14:14.480 --> 14:17.799
There's a difference
between dormant and patient.

14:17.880 --> 14:20.759
What does that mean,
it's a statue when you see it?

14:20.840 --> 14:25.399
The Weeping Angels can only move
if they're unseen. So legend has it.

14:25.480 --> 14:28.039
No, it's not legend. It's a quantum lock.

14:28.120 --> 14:32.159
In the sight of any living creature,
the Angels literally cease to exist.

14:32.240 --> 14:35.519
They're just stone.
The ultimate defence mechanism.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.359
What, being a stone?

14:37.440 --> 14:41.719
Being a stone...until you turn your back.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.599
The hyperdrive would've split open
on impact.

14:47.680 --> 14:50.799
The whole ship will be flooded
with radiation, cracked electrons,

14:50.880 --> 14:53.119
gravity storms,
deadly to almost any living thing.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.159
Deadly to an Angel?

14:54.240 --> 14:57.679
Dinner to an Angel. The longer
we leave it, the stronger it will grow.

14:57.760 --> 14:58.879
Who built that temple?
Are they still around?

14:58.960 --> 15:03.359
The Aplans. Indigenous life form.
Died out 400 years ago.

15:03.440 --> 15:05.359
200 years later,
the planet was terraformed.

15:05.440 --> 15:08.319
Currently there are
six billion human colonists.

15:08.440 --> 15:12.479
You lot, you're everywhere! Like rabbits!
I'll never get done saving you.

15:12.560 --> 15:15.199
Sir, if there is a clear and present
danger to the local population...

15:15.280 --> 15:19.919
Oh, there is. Bad as it gets.
Bishop, lock and load!

15:20.040 --> 15:24.039
Verger, how are we doing
with those explosives? Dr Song, with me.

15:24.120 --> 15:27.479
- Two minutes. Sweetie, I need you.
- (HE MOUTHS)

15:27.560 --> 15:30.719
Anybody need me? Nobody?

15:45.840 --> 15:48.319
I found this.
Definitive work on the Angels.

15:48.440 --> 15:51.719
Well, the only one.
Written by a madman, it's barely readable,

15:51.800 --> 15:53.999
- but I've marked a few passages.
- Not bad, bit slow in the middle,

15:54.080 --> 15:56.759
didn't you hate his girlfriend?
No, hang on, wait, wait!

15:56.840 --> 16:01.479
Dr Song? Did you have
more than one clip of the Angel?

16:01.560 --> 16:03.479
No, just the four seconds.

16:03.560 --> 16:07.599
This book is wrong. What's wrong
with this book? It's wrong.

16:33.160 --> 16:37.879
It's so strange when you go
all baby-face. How early is this for you?

16:37.960 --> 16:39.399
Very early.

16:39.480 --> 16:41.719
So you don't know who I am yet?

16:41.800 --> 16:44.439
How do you know who I am?
I don't always look the same.

16:44.520 --> 16:45.959
I've got pictures of all your faces.

16:46.040 --> 16:49.799
You never show up in the right order,
though. I need the spotter's guide.

16:49.880 --> 16:52.319
Pictures? Why aren't there pictures?

17:24.680 --> 17:29.959
You're just a recording. You can't move.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.559
(SHE GASPS)

17:51.120 --> 18:00.799
Doctor!

18:00.880 --> 18:03.319
This whole book - it's a warning
about the Weeping Angels.

18:03.440 --> 18:05.199
So why no pictures?
Why not show us what to look out for?

18:05.280 --> 18:07.879
There was a bit about images.
What was that?

18:07.960 --> 18:09.919
Yes! Hang on...

18:10.000 --> 18:13.839
"That which holds the image
of an angel becomes itself an angel."

18:17.480 --> 18:20.199
Doctor!

18:20.280 --> 18:25.719
What does that mean? "An image
of a Angel becomes itself an Angel."

18:28.680 --> 18:30.839
Doctor! It's in the room!

18:30.920 --> 18:32.999
- Amy!
- Doctor!

18:33.080 --> 18:36.679
Are you all right? What's happening?

18:36.800 --> 18:40.399
Doctor! Doctor, it's coming
out of the television. The Angel is here.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.719
Don't take your eyes off it! Keep
looking. It can't move if you're looking.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.679
- What's wrong?
- Deadlocked.

18:44.760 --> 18:46.719
- There is no deadlock.
- Don't even blink, Amy!

18:46.800 --> 18:47.719
Doctor!

18:47.800 --> 18:50.479
- What are you doing?
- Cutting the power.

18:50.560 --> 18:53.279
It's using the screen,
I'm turning the screen off.

18:53.360 --> 18:56.919
- It's deadlocked the whole system.
- There's no deadlock.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.879
- There is now.
- Help me!

18:58.960 --> 19:00.039
- Can you turn it off?
- Doctor!

19:00.120 --> 19:02.599
- The screen, can you turn it off?
- I tried.

19:02.680 --> 19:03.879
Try again, but don't take your eyes
off the Angel.

19:03.960 --> 19:06.479
I'm not!

19:06.560 --> 19:09.079
If something moves,
it'll move faster. Don't even blink.

19:10.120 --> 19:13.239
I'm not blinking!
Have you ever tried not blinking?

19:29.360 --> 19:32.719
- It just keeps switching it back on!
- Yeah, it's the Angel.

19:33.720 --> 19:35.159
But it's just a recording.

19:35.240 --> 19:40.679
No, anything that takes
the image of an Angel is an Angel.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.159
What are you doing?

19:43.240 --> 19:44.359
I'm trying to cut through.
It's not even warm.

19:44.440 --> 19:46.479
There is no way in,
it's not physically possible.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.519
Doctor, what's it going to do to me?

19:49.600 --> 19:52.559
Just keep looking at it.
Don't stop looking!

19:52.640 --> 19:54.439
Just tell me.

19:54.520 --> 19:57.959
Just tell me. Tell me!

19:58.040 --> 20:00.679
Amy, not the eyes. Look at the Angel,
but don't look at the eyes.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.359
- Why?
- What is it?

20:04.440 --> 20:06.879
"The eyes are not the windows
of the soul, they are the doors.

20:06.960 --> 20:10.159
- "Beware what may enter there."
- Doctor, what did you say?

20:10.240 --> 20:12.279
Don't look at the eyes!

20:12.360 --> 20:14.919
No, about images,
what did you say about images?

20:15.000 --> 20:18.159
Whatever holds the image
of an angel is an angel.

20:19.200 --> 20:22.919
OK... Hold this.

20:23.000 --> 20:27.759
One, two, three, four...

20:30.520 --> 20:32.079
(DOOR OPENS)

20:33.640 --> 20:35.239
I froze it!

20:35.320 --> 20:38.599
There was a sort of blip on the tape
and I froze it on the blip.

20:38.680 --> 20:42.359
It wasn't the image of an angel
any more. That was good, yeah?

20:42.440 --> 20:45.079
It was, wasn't it? That was pretty good.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.239
- RIVER: That was amazing!
- River, hug Amy.

20:47.320 --> 20:48.759
- Why?
- Cos I'm busy.

20:48.840 --> 20:50.399
I'm fine.

20:50.480 --> 20:53.119
- You're brilliant!
- Thanks. Yeah.

20:53.200 --> 20:54.799
I kind of creamed it, didn't I?

20:54.880 --> 20:58.519
- So it was here? That was the Angel?
- That was the projection of the Angel.

20:58.640 --> 21:02.959
It's reaching out, getting
a good look at us. It's no longer dormant.

21:06.560 --> 21:07.839
Plus one positive!

21:09.880 --> 21:11.839
Doctor! We're through!

21:11.920 --> 21:15.759
OK. Now it starts.

21:22.480 --> 21:24.559
- Coming?
- Yeah, coming.

21:24.640 --> 21:27.599
There's just...something in my eye.

21:39.440 --> 21:41.919
Do we have a gravity globe?

21:42.000 --> 21:43.559
Grav globe.

21:44.800 --> 21:47.679
Where are we? What is this?

21:47.760 --> 21:50.159
It's an Aplan mortarium -

21:50.240 --> 21:51.959
sometimes called a maze of the dead.

21:52.040 --> 21:53.359
What's that?

21:53.440 --> 21:56.119
Well, if you happen to be
a creature of living stone...

21:59.320 --> 22:01.239
Ha, ha.

22:05.760 --> 22:08.159
...the perfect hiding place.

22:09.480 --> 22:11.919
I guess this makes it a bit trickier.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.679
A bit, yeah.

22:13.760 --> 22:17.839
A stone angel on the loose
amongst stone statues.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.479
A lot harder than I prayed for.

22:19.560 --> 22:21.639
A needle in a haystack.

22:21.720 --> 22:24.199
A needle that looks like hay.
A hay-like needle. Of death.

22:24.280 --> 22:27.199
A hay-like needle of death
in a haystack of, er, statues.

22:28.240 --> 22:29.919
No, yours was fine.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.599
Right. Check every single statue
in this chamber.

22:33.680 --> 22:35.799
You know what you're looking for.
Complete visual inspection.

22:35.880 --> 22:38.359
One question - how do we fight it?

22:38.440 --> 22:40.119
We find it, and hope.

22:45.560 --> 22:48.919
He doesn't know yet, does he?
Who and what you are.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.199
It's too early in his time stream.

22:51.320 --> 22:55.479
Well, make sure he doesn't work it out,
or he's not going to help us.

22:55.560 --> 22:57.239
I won't let you down.

22:57.320 --> 23:02.079
Believe you me, I have no intention
of going back to prison.

23:04.120 --> 23:06.399
Sir? Side chamber. One visible exit.

23:08.520 --> 23:12.079
Check it out. Angelo, go with him.

23:58.400 --> 24:02.159
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

24:02.240 --> 24:05.519
So what's a maze of the dead?

24:05.600 --> 24:07.719
Oh, it's not as bad as it sounds.

24:07.800 --> 24:10.719
It's just a labyrinth
with dead people buried in the walls.

24:10.800 --> 24:13.559
OK, that was fairly bad.

24:13.640 --> 24:18.879
Right, give me your arm...

24:18.960 --> 24:20.959
This won't hurt a bit.

24:22.880 --> 24:24.999
- Ow!
- There, you see. I lied.

24:25.080 --> 24:26.879
It's a viro-stabiliser.

24:27.000 --> 24:32.479
Stabilises your metabolism
against radiation, drive burn, anything.

24:32.560 --> 24:34.239
You'll need it

24:34.320 --> 24:35.959

24:36.080 --> 24:40.679
In the future, I mean. Cos you know him
in the future, don't you?

24:42.040 --> 24:42.999
The Doctor?

24:43.080 --> 24:45.239
Well, the Doctor's the Doctor.

24:46.520 --> 24:52.079
Oh, well, that's, um, very helpful.
Mind if I write that down?

24:52.160 --> 24:55.199
- Yes, we are.
- Sorry, what?

24:55.280 --> 24:58.959
- Talking about you.
- I wasn't listening, I'm busy.

24:59.040 --> 25:00.319
Ah. The other way up.

25:05.480 --> 25:08.799
- Yeah.
- You're so his wife.

25:08.880 --> 25:12.279
Oh, Amy, Amy, Amy!
This is the Doctor we're talking about.

25:12.360 --> 25:14.559
Do you really think it could be
anything that simple?

25:14.640 --> 25:15.919
Yep.

25:17.320 --> 25:20.599
You're good. I'm not saying you're right,

25:20.680 --> 25:25.399
but you are very good.

25:31.240 --> 25:34.999
CLERIC: Can you believe this?
We're hunting statues.

25:37.320 --> 25:39.559
Better than chasing lava snakes.

25:41.320 --> 25:43.679
Actually, lava snakes weren't that bad.

- Just come and see it.

26:49.480 --> 26:52.559
It's not a school trip. Just tell me.

No, really, come and see.

(RAPID GUNFIRE)

27:19.880 --> 27:21.479
Sorry. Sorry, I thought...

27:21.560 --> 27:23.239
I thought it looked at me.

27:23.320 --> 27:25.519
We know what the Angel looks like.
Is that the Angel?

27:25.600 --> 27:27.799
- No, sir.
- No, sir, it is not!

27:27.880 --> 27:30.359
According to the Doctor,
we are facing an enemy

27:30.440 --> 27:32.279
of unknowable power and infinite evil.

27:32.360 --> 27:34.799
So it would be good,
it would be very good,

27:34.880 --> 27:38.199
if we could all remain calm
in the presence of décor.

27:38.280 --> 27:40.639
- What's your name?
- Bob, sir.

27:40.720 --> 27:44.799
- Ah, that's a great name. I love Bob.
- It's a Sacred Name.

27:44.880 --> 27:50.359
We all have Sacred Names. They're given
to us in the service of the Church.

27:50.440 --> 27:53.199
Sacred Bob. More like Scared Bob now, eh?

27:53.280 --> 27:55.399
Yes, sir.

27:55.480 --> 27:57.239
Ah, good.

27:57.320 --> 27:58.919
Scared keeps you fast.

27:59.000 --> 28:03.119
Anyone in this room who isn't scared
is a moron.

28:04.160 --> 28:05.399
Carry on.

28:09.800 --> 28:12.319
We'll be moving into the maze
in two minutes.

28:12.400 --> 28:16.319
You stay with Christian and Angelo.
Guard the approach.

Isn't there a chance
this lot's just going to collapse?

- There's a whole ship up there.
- RIVER: Incredible builders, the Aplans.

28:31.560 --> 28:34.839
Had dinner with their chief architect
once. Two heads are better than one.

28:34.920 --> 28:37.719
- What, you mean you helped him?
- No, I mean he had two heads.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.159
That book. The very end, what did it say?

28:39.240 --> 28:43.839
- Hang on.
- Read it to me.

It's a hell of a climb.

representing the ascent of the soul.

29:19.400 --> 29:21.799
Only two levels to go.

We should visit them sometime.

I'm on her bowling team.

29:31.240 --> 29:33.039
Very relaxed, sort of cheerful.

29:33.120 --> 29:37.279
That's having two heads. You're never
short of a snog with an extra head.

29:37.360 --> 29:39.479
Doctor, there's something.
I don't know what it is...

29:39.560 --> 29:41.119
Yeah, there's something wrong.

29:41.200 --> 29:42.279
Don't know what it is yet, either.
Working on it.

29:42.360 --> 29:46.519
Then they had laws against self-marrying
and what was that about?

29:46.600 --> 29:50.959
But that's the Church for you.
Er, no offence, Bishop.

29:51.040 --> 29:54.359
Quite a lot taken,
if that's all right, Doctor.

30:01.840 --> 30:06.279
Lowest point in the wreckage is only
about 50 feet up from here. That way.

30:06.360 --> 30:09.159

if you think about it.

30:09.240 --> 30:12.079
The divorces must have been messy.

Oh!

What's wrong?

30:19.200 --> 30:20.399
Oh.

30:28.280 --> 30:29.919
Exactly.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.919
How could we not notice that?

30:32.000 --> 30:35.239
Low-level perception filter,
or maybe we're thick.

30:35.320 --> 30:36.839
What's wrong, sir? Nobody move.

30:36.920 --> 30:39.839
Everyone stay exactly where they are.
Bishop, I am truly sorry.

30:39.920 --> 30:42.239
I've made a mistake
and we are all in terrible danger.

30:42.320 --> 30:43.399
What danger?

30:48.800 --> 30:50.199
The Aplans?

30:50.280 --> 30:52.079
- They've got two heads.
- Yes, I get that. So?

30:52.160 --> 30:54.399
THE DOCTOR: So why don't the statues?

30:55.960 --> 31:00.759
Everyone, over there. Just move,
don't ask questions, don't speak.

31:05.720 --> 31:10.719

32:30.760 --> 32:33.599
Angelo?

32:33.680 --> 32:35.999
Come and see what we've found.

32:36.120 --> 32:39.479
Are you with Christian?
The Bishop said you'd be five minutes.

32:39.560 --> 32:42.239
I'm here, Bob. Come and see this.

32:42.320 --> 32:44.799
Where are you?

32:44.920 --> 32:48.959
Through the arch, Bob.
Honestly, you've got to come and see this.

32:49.040 --> 32:50.279
What have you found?

32:50.360 --> 32:51.999
Come and see.

32:52.080 --> 32:54.279
No. What is it?

32:54.360 --> 32:56.359
Come and see.

33:21.120 --> 33:24.159
There was only one Angel on the ship.
Just the one, I swear.

33:24.240 --> 33:26.439
Could they have been here already?

33:26.520 --> 33:29.479
- The Aplans, how did they die out?
- Nobody knows.

33:29.560 --> 33:31.519
We know. They don't look like Angels.

33:31.600 --> 33:33.679
And they're not fast.
You said they were fast.

33:33.760 --> 33:35.919
They should have had us by now.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.159
They're dying. Losing their form.
They've been here for centuries,

33:38.240 --> 33:39.719
- starving.
- Losing their image.

33:39.800 --> 33:42.759
And their image is their power. Power...

33:42.840 --> 33:44.079
- Power!
- Doctor?

33:44.160 --> 33:47.559
Don't you see? All that radiation
spilling out, the drive burn.

33:47.640 --> 33:49.879
The crash of the Byzantium wasn't
an accident - it was a rescue mission

33:49.960 --> 33:53.439
for the Angels. We're in the middle
of an army and it's waking up.

33:53.520 --> 33:55.159
We need to get out of here fast.

33:55.240 --> 33:59.879
Bob, Angelo, Christian, come in,
please. Any of you, come in!

33:59.960 --> 34:02.799
OVER RADIO:
It's Bob, sir. Sorry, sir.

34:02.880 --> 34:06.079
Bob, are Angelo and Christian with you?
All the statues are active.

34:06.160 --> 34:09.959
- I repeat, all the statues are active!
- I know, sir.

34:10.040 --> 34:13.439
Angelo and Christian are dead, sir.
The statues killed them, sir.

34:13.520 --> 34:16.599
Bob, Sacred Bob, it's me, the Doctor.
Where are you now?

34:16.680 --> 34:18.679
- I'm talking to my...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, shut up!

34:18.760 --> 34:21.279
I'm on my way up to you, sir.
I'm homing in on your signal.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.999
Well done, Bob.
Scared keeps you fast. Told you.

34:24.080 --> 34:25.799
Your friends, Bob,
what did the Angel do to them?

34:25.880 --> 34:28.879
- Snapped their necks, sir.
- That's odd.

34:28.960 --> 34:31.599
That's not how the Angels kill you,
they displace you in time.

34:31.680 --> 34:34.159
Unless they needed bodies for something.

34:34.240 --> 34:37.519
Bob, did you check
their data packs for vital signs?

34:37.600 --> 34:40.119
We may be able to initiate a rescue plan.

34:40.200 --> 34:42.079
Don't be an idiot!
The Angels don't leave you alive!

34:42.160 --> 34:44.759
Bob, keep running, but tell me,
how did you escape?

34:44.840 --> 34:48.999
I didn't escape, sir.
The Angel killed me, too.

34:52.800 --> 34:55.319
What do you mean,
the Angel killed you, too?

34:55.400 --> 34:58.439
Snapped my neck, sir.
Wasn't as painless as I expected,

34:58.520 --> 35:01.159
but it was pretty quick,
so that was something.

35:01.240 --> 35:03.039
If you're dead,
how can I be talking to you?

35:03.120 --> 35:06.359
You're not talking to me, sir.
The Angel has no voice.

35:06.440 --> 35:09.559
It stripped my cerebral cortex
and re-animated a version

35:09.640 --> 35:11.879
of my consciousness to communicate
with you. Sorry about the confusion.

35:11.960 --> 35:15.519
So when you say
you're on your way up to us...

35:15.640 --> 35:18.359
- It's the Angel that's coming, sir, yes.
- No way out.

35:18.480 --> 35:22.079
- Then we get out through the wreckage.
- Go, go. All of you, run!

35:22.160 --> 35:23.999
- Doctor?
- Yes, I'm coming, just go, go, go!

35:27.240 --> 35:31.399
Called you an idiot. Sorry, but there's
no way we could have rescued your men.

35:31.480 --> 35:34.959
I know that, sir. And when you've
flown away in your little blue box,

35:35.040 --> 35:36.999
I'll explain that to their families.

35:42.480 --> 35:46.839
Angel Bob, which Angel
am I talking to? The one from the ship?

35:46.920 --> 35:47.999
Yes, sir.

35:48.080 --> 35:50.279
And the other Angels are still restoring.

35:50.360 --> 35:53.599
Ah, so the Angel is not
in the wreckage. Thank you.

35:55.080 --> 35:57.039
Don't wait for me. Go, run.

35:57.120 --> 35:58.319
I can't!

35:59.760 --> 36:02.079
No, really, I can't.

36:02.200 --> 36:06.399
- Why not?
- Look at it. Look at my hand. It's stone!

36:18.000 --> 36:22.919
Well. There it is - the Byzantium.

36:24.720 --> 36:27.839
It's got to be 30 feet.
How do we get up there?

36:29.120 --> 36:32.639
Check all these exits.
I want them all secure.

36:32.720 --> 36:35.359
You looked into the eyes
of an Angel, didn't you?

36:35.440 --> 36:37.159
I couldn't stop myself. I tried.

36:37.240 --> 36:39.119
Listen. It's messing with your head.
Your hand is not made of stone.

36:39.200 --> 36:41.399
It is. Look at it!

36:41.480 --> 36:43.919
It's in your mind. I promise you.
You can move that hand.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.479
- You can let go.
- I can't, OK?

36:45.560 --> 36:47.559
I've tried and I can't. It's stone.

36:47.640 --> 36:51.439
The Angel is going to come
and it's going to turn this light off,

36:51.520 --> 36:54.399
and then there's nothing
I can do to stop it.

36:54.480 --> 36:57.079
- So do it, concentrate, move your hand.
- I can't.

36:57.160 --> 36:59.519
- Then we're both going to die.
- You're not going to die.

36:59.600 --> 37:02.479
They'll kill the lights.

37:02.560 --> 37:04.319
You've got to go, you know you have.

37:04.400 --> 37:06.559
You've got all that stuff with River
and that's all got to happen.

37:06.640 --> 37:08.639
You know you can't die here!

37:08.720 --> 37:11.519
Time can be re-written,
it doesn't work like that.

37:13.680 --> 37:16.439
- Keep your eyes on it. Don't blink.
- Run!

37:16.520 --> 37:18.959
You see, I'm not going,
I'm not leaving you here.

37:19.040 --> 37:21.479
I don't need you to die for me,
Doctor, do I look that clingy?

37:21.560 --> 37:22.519
You can move your hand.

37:22.600 --> 37:25.279
- It's stone.
- It's not stone!

37:25.360 --> 37:27.479
Those people up there
will die without you.

37:27.560 --> 37:29.239
If you stay here with me,
you'll have as good as killed them.

37:29.320 --> 37:33.119
Amy Pond, you are magnificent.
And I'm sorry.

37:33.200 --> 37:36.279
It's OK. I understand.

37:36.360 --> 37:38.359
You've got to leave me.

37:38.440 --> 37:40.919
Oh, no, I'm not leaving you, never.
I'm sorry about this.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.439
- See, not stone! Now run!
- You bit me!

37:43.520 --> 37:45.359
Yeah, and you're alive.

37:45.440 --> 37:47.479
I've got a mark! Look at my hand!

37:47.600 --> 37:50.879
- Yeah, and you're alive, did I mention?
- Blimey, your teeth!

37:50.960 --> 37:52.599
Have you got space teeth?

37:52.680 --> 37:54.639
Alive. All I'm saying.

37:57.000 --> 38:00.239
The statues are advancing
along all corridors.

38:00.320 --> 38:02.239
And, sir, my torch keeps flickering.

38:02.320 --> 38:03.239
- They all do.
- So does the gravity globe.

38:03.320 --> 38:07.679
Clerics, we're down to four men.
Expect incoming.

38:07.760 --> 38:09.479
Yeah, it's the Angels.

38:09.560 --> 38:12.159
They're coming. And they're draining
the power for themselves.

38:12.240 --> 38:15.039
Which means we won't be able to see them.

38:15.120 --> 38:17.479
- Which means we can't stay here.
- There are two more incoming!

38:17.560 --> 38:18.879
Any suggestions?

38:18.960 --> 38:21.039
The statues are advancing on all sides

38:21.160 --> 38:24.039
and we don't have the climbing equipment
to reach the Byzantium.

38:24.120 --> 38:25.919
There's no way up, no way back,
no way out.

38:26.000 --> 38:29.559
No pressure, but this is usually
when you have a really good idea.

38:32.640 --> 38:38.119
There's always a way out.

38:39.800 --> 38:41.359
RADIO: Doctor?

38:41.440 --> 38:45.479
- Can I speak to the Doctor, please?
- Hello, Angels. What's your problem?

38:45.560 --> 38:48.079
Your power will not last much longer,

38:48.200 --> 38:51.719
and the Angels will be with you shortly.
Sorry, sir.

38:51.800 --> 38:53.039
Why are you telling me this?

38:53.080 --> 38:54.519
There's something the Angels are very
keen you should know before the end.

38:54.600 --> 38:58.279
- Which is?
- I died in fear.

38:58.360 --> 38:59.919
I'm sorry?

39:00.000 --> 39:02.679
You told me my fear would keep me alive,

39:02.760 --> 39:05.199
but I died afraid, in pain and alone.

39:05.320 --> 39:08.559
You made me trust you,
and when it mattered, you let me down.

39:08.640 --> 39:10.599
What are they doing?

39:10.680 --> 39:12.679
They're trying to make him angry.

39:12.800 --> 39:16.159
I'm sorry, sir. The Angels were very keen
for you to know that.

39:16.240 --> 39:19.999
Well, then, the Angels have made
their second mistake,

39:20.080 --> 39:22.799
because I'm not going to let that pass.

39:22.880 --> 39:25.479
I'm sorry you're dead, Bob,
but I swear to whatever is left of you,

39:25.560 --> 39:26.399
they will be sorrier.

39:26.480 --> 39:29.199
But you're trapped, sir, and about to die.

39:29.280 --> 39:30.479
Yeah. I'm trapped.

39:30.560 --> 39:33.279
Speaking of traps, this trap has got
a great, big mistake in it.

39:33.360 --> 39:35.079
A great, big, whopping mistake!

39:35.160 --> 39:38.599
- What mistake, sir?
- Trust me.

39:38.680 --> 39:41.199
- Yeah.
- Trust me?

39:41.280 --> 39:42.759
- Always.
- You lot - trust me?

39:45.560 --> 39:48.759
- Sir, two more incoming!
- We have faith, sir.

39:48.840 --> 39:50.959
Then give me your gun.

39:53.720 --> 39:56.999
I'm about to do something
incredibly stupid and dangerous.

39:57.080 --> 40:00.199
- When I do...jump!
- Jump where?

40:00.280 --> 40:03.159
Just jump, high as you can.
Come on, leap of faith, Bishop.

40:03.240 --> 40:03.959
- On my signal.
- What signal?

40:04.000 --> 40:06.239
You won't miss it.

40:06.320 --> 40:08.759
RADIO: Sorry, can I ask again?
You mentioned a mistake?

40:08.840 --> 40:10.039
Oh, big mistake. Really huge.

40:10.080 --> 40:13.199
There's one thing you never put in a trap
if you're smart.

40:13.320 --> 40:17.439
If you value your continued existence, if
you have any plans about seeing tomorrow,

40:17.520 --> 40:21.239
there is one thing
you never, ever put in a trap.

40:21.320 --> 40:23.079
And what would that be, sir?

40:24.120 --> 40:25.239
Me.
