WEBVTT

00:04.752 --> 00:06.653
Well, that about wraps up <i>Tool Time.</i>

00:06.721 --> 00:09.281
So, Tim, what have we learned today?

00:10.458 --> 00:13.724
Well, we learned that
blown foam insulation is a great way

00:13.795 --> 00:16.424
to reduce energy costs at your house.

00:16.798 --> 00:17.959
And?

00:18.466 --> 00:22.233
Well, and that blown foam insulation
is a great sound-dampener.

00:23.404 --> 00:27.068
And when the manufacturer says
100 psi max,

00:27.141 --> 00:30.509
they mean 100 psi

00:31.646 --> 00:32.807
max!

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074

01:26.067 --> 01:27.399
- Hey, Al.
- Hey.

01:27.468 --> 01:31.030
Cable show ratings just came in.
I think you might want to take a look.

01:31.406 --> 01:32.704
Congratulations, Heidi!

01:32.774 --> 01:35.903
You won again
with males aged 13 to 95.

01:36.844 --> 01:38.335
Keep reading.

01:39.914 --> 01:42.543
Ah, well, my ratings are up again
in the "likeability" column.

01:42.617 --> 01:43.778
You're off the charts!

01:43.851 --> 01:46.980
Yeah. Oh, my God! I beat Tim!

01:47.055 --> 01:49.024
Yes! Congratulations.

01:49.090 --> 01:52.925
Listen, you really ought to take
advantage of this new popularity.

01:52.994 --> 01:53.994
What do you mean?

01:54.062 --> 01:56.588
Well, when's the last time
you appeared in public?

01:56.664 --> 02:00.226
Well, Tuesday I went to the mall
for peanut brittle and a belt.

02:00.301 --> 02:02.964
I mean, you should be doing
promotions and endorsements.

02:03.037 --> 02:06.303
Al, you could be the next Ed McMahon.

02:06.374 --> 02:07.808
- Ed McMahon?
- Uh-huh.

02:11.779 --> 02:13.551
- I'll be goshed...
- Hey, guys. Who's got the ratings?

02:13.581 --> 02:14.786
- Hide them. Here comes Tim.
- Okay.

02:14.816 --> 02:15.953
- There we go.
- Where's the ratings sheet?

02:15.983 --> 02:17.055
- Huh? What?
- I don't know.

02:17.085 --> 02:19.247
Huh? What? Huh? This.

02:19.354 --> 02:20.447
Oh!

02:21.489 --> 02:24.823
Hey, once again,
Heidi, in the stratosphere.

02:24.892 --> 02:27.020
What is it with you and men?

02:29.063 --> 02:32.124
- What the...
- Hey, the show's doing pretty well.

02:32.200 --> 02:33.566
Oh, no.

02:35.703 --> 02:38.537
I didn't beat you by much!
Okay, I'll clear out my locker.

02:38.606 --> 02:39.972
Hey, don't be ridiculous.

02:40.074 --> 02:41.212
Whatever gave you guys the idea

02:41.242 --> 02:43.074
this was some type of competition?
Come on!

02:43.144 --> 02:45.184
Well, maybe because every month
when these come out,

02:45.246 --> 02:47.511
Tim runs around going,
"I won! I won! I won!"

02:47.582 --> 02:50.950
All right. All right. Okay.
Maybe Heidi's right.

02:51.052 --> 02:53.078
This isn't a competition.

02:53.154 --> 02:56.022
These numbers are good for the show.
Good for you, Al.

02:56.090 --> 02:57.649
- We're a family here.
- Yeah.

02:57.725 --> 02:58.988
Well, thank you, Tim.

02:59.060 --> 03:02.087
You know, I never thought
this would happen to me.

03:02.163 --> 03:04.257
I've always lived
in someone else's shadow.

03:04.332 --> 03:08.702
Well, growing up with your mom, I'm
surprised you knew there was a sun.

03:09.070 --> 03:12.438
All right!
I'm gonna go tell Trudy the good news.

03:12.540 --> 03:15.669
- Yeah. Congratulations again, Al.
- Thank you!

03:15.743 --> 03:17.006
I think he took it pretty well.

03:17.078 --> 03:19.047
- Yeah, I think so.
- Yeah.

03:26.954 --> 03:29.014
- Hey, Brad?
- What's up, Mark?

03:29.090 --> 03:31.924
If a girl named Erica calls,
tell her I'm not here, all right?

03:31.993 --> 03:34.155
What? Is she, like, the ugliest girl
in junior high?

03:34.228 --> 03:37.357
Actually, she's the prettiest.
I wish she'd just leave me alone.

03:37.432 --> 03:40.596
Wait, wait.
There's no way you and I are related.

03:41.536 --> 03:43.266
I'd love to go out with Erica.

03:43.337 --> 03:46.865
Just all she does is complain
about her jerk boyfriend.

03:46.941 --> 03:48.910
Mark, Mark, wake up.

03:48.976 --> 03:51.070
She's using you
as her shoulder to cry on.

03:51.145 --> 03:52.477
You know what that means, right?

03:52.547 --> 03:54.709
Yeah. She thinks I'm a girl.

03:56.951 --> 04:00.012
No. No. She thinks you're
a caring, sensitive listener.

04:00.087 --> 04:02.955
And when she finally breaks up
with that jerk boyfriend of hers,

04:03.024 --> 04:04.492
you're in the pole position.

04:04.559 --> 04:07.028
All I have to do is just sit on the phone
and listen?

04:07.095 --> 04:09.997
You don't even have to listen.
Just pretend.

04:10.631 --> 04:14.966
Every so often say lines like
"I sympathize with your needs."

04:15.036 --> 04:20.065
And when you want to whip out
the big guns, try "I hurt when you hurt."

04:22.210 --> 04:25.271
This is so devious. Thank you.

04:29.684 --> 04:30.743
Hi.

04:30.818 --> 04:32.753
Hi. Did you get my tulip bulbs?

04:32.820 --> 04:35.847
Oh! I forgot to go by the garden center.
I'm sorry.

04:35.923 --> 04:37.061
- Let me ask you a question.
- What?

04:37.091 --> 04:38.821
Am I a likable guy?

04:38.893 --> 04:40.987
Are you gonna get my bulbs?

04:41.662 --> 04:45.292
What would you say if I told you
that Al was more likable than me?

04:45.366 --> 04:46.459
Duh?

04:48.236 --> 04:52.401
Our ratings came out today
and for the first time in 10 years,

04:52.507 --> 04:54.806
Al was rated more likable than me.

04:54.876 --> 04:56.606
So this is bothering you, right?

04:56.677 --> 04:57.975
Well, duh.

04:59.413 --> 05:02.144
You don't think Binford would think
about switching hosts, do you?

05:02.216 --> 05:06.119
Honey, that's never gonna happen.

05:06.687 --> 05:09.714
Look, Al hosted the show once
and it was a disaster.

05:09.790 --> 05:11.952
He needs you to make it all work.

05:12.059 --> 05:13.118
Huh?

05:14.295 --> 05:18.824
Well, see, look, you took
a shy, insecure, stiff guy

05:18.900 --> 05:22.462
and you turned him into
a likable, confident, stiff guy.

05:23.604 --> 05:26.438
You gave him his persona.
You invented the signature salute.

05:26.507 --> 05:28.999
You sort of created Al.

05:29.076 --> 05:32.979
I did. I created Al. Almost like
Al is my Frankenstein monster.

05:33.414 --> 05:36.384
You know,
without the attractive neck bolts.

05:36.484 --> 05:38.453
He's alive!

05:40.488 --> 05:43.390
Now, see? That's what you should do.
Just enjoy the fruits of your labor.

05:43.457 --> 05:47.360
Yeah. You know,
and maybe accept my fate in a way.

05:47.428 --> 05:50.159
You know, because even
the brightest stars can't shine forever.

05:50.231 --> 05:53.668
I mean, there's a point when the
champions like me and Michael Jordan

05:53.734 --> 05:56.795
just have to pass our balls
on to somebody else.

05:59.540 --> 06:01.634
- Hey, Fred.
- Hey, Mr. Taylor.

06:01.709 --> 06:02.733
Do you have tulips?

06:02.810 --> 06:05.541
Well, it'd be hard to whistle if I didn't.

06:05.613 --> 06:06.706
- You get it?
- Yeah.

06:06.781 --> 06:08.113
- It's a gag.
- Yeah.

06:08.182 --> 06:10.142
Hey, I've got your special bulb order
in the back.

06:10.184 --> 06:12.813
While I'm digging them up,
why don't you say hi to your buddy Al?

06:12.887 --> 06:15.049
- He's in Fertilizer.
- Al?

06:16.157 --> 06:18.422
"Hope you enjoy your bag of

06:18.492 --> 06:21.394
"fert-Al-izer."

06:22.763 --> 06:23.763
Hey, Al.

06:23.831 --> 06:26.926
Tim! Hey, ladies and gentlemen!
Tim Taylor! All right!

06:27.468 --> 06:28.506
Tim, what are you doing here?

06:28.536 --> 06:30.107
I was just about to ask you
the same thing.

06:30.137 --> 06:33.767
Yeah? Well, I decided to branch out
into endorsements.

06:36.644 --> 06:38.806
You're endorsing fertilizer.

06:39.080 --> 06:42.812
Yeah. I guess it's kind of like working
from the ground up.

06:44.285 --> 06:45.947
Can I talk to you privately for a minute?

06:46.020 --> 06:47.044
Sure.

06:47.121 --> 06:48.759
Mr. Likeability will be back
in a few minutes

06:48.789 --> 06:49.927
to sign your bags. Okay, guys?

06:49.957 --> 06:54.327
Meanwhile, why don't you pull your
cars around so I can load them easier?

06:54.395 --> 06:55.954
Come out here.

06:57.665 --> 06:58.689
What are you doing?

06:58.766 --> 07:01.292
I'm capitalizing
on my newfound popularity.

07:01.369 --> 07:03.774
Is this why you've been leaving work
early for the last couple of days?

07:03.804 --> 07:06.569
Well, actually, on Tuesday
I opened a lamp store.

07:06.674 --> 07:10.441
And on Wednesday I was
keynote speaker at Spacklefest '98!

07:12.947 --> 07:15.473
If you want to capitalize
on your newfound popularity,

07:15.549 --> 07:19.884
you might want to aim your sights
a little higher than spackle and dung.

07:19.954 --> 07:22.082
Well, I don't want to impose
on our friendship.

07:22.156 --> 07:25.320
But if you could give me some career
advice, you know, coach me a little,

07:25.426 --> 07:28.191
maybe I could get
some better endorsements.

07:28.295 --> 07:31.060
Well, I hate to see you signing
this crap.

07:32.833 --> 07:35.302
- Hi.
- Hi. What are you doing?

07:35.369 --> 07:37.235
Mapping out Al's destiny.

07:37.304 --> 07:40.399
And yet you couldn't put the dishes
in the sink.

07:41.275 --> 07:43.540
Listen to this. I got him the cover
of <i>Handyman Monthly.</i>

07:43.611 --> 07:45.883
On Saturday, he's doing a radio
commercial for Welder's Warehouse,

07:45.913 --> 07:49.475
and Sunday, a pre-shoot
for a commercial for Faucets-N-Stuff.

07:49.550 --> 07:50.855
You know, I'm really impressed
with the way

07:50.885 --> 07:53.354
you've been able to put your ego aside
and help Al.

07:53.421 --> 07:56.357
Honey, he was knee-deep
swimming in cow pies.

07:57.992 --> 08:00.552
And you dove in and saved him.

08:00.628 --> 08:01.891
I like this stuff.

08:01.962 --> 08:06.263
Now, Al's strengths are his sincerity
and his groundbreaking dullness.

08:07.868 --> 08:11.498
I can manipulate that kind of talent
a 100 ways from Sunday.

08:12.506 --> 08:13.804
And yet...

08:17.411 --> 08:20.017
Come on, come on, come on. If you
want to go to the mall, I'm leaving now.

08:20.047 --> 08:21.811
Hey, listen, Erica, I got to go.

08:21.916 --> 08:25.353
But I just want to let you know
that I'm here for you

08:25.419 --> 08:28.048
and that I sympathize with your needs.

08:29.490 --> 08:33.655
Oh, really? Hey, great. All right.
See you then. Bye.

08:34.462 --> 08:37.761
Guess what? Erica's coming over
to cry on my shoulder.

08:37.832 --> 08:39.460
What's the matter with Erica?

08:39.533 --> 08:40.638
Oh, her boyfriend broke up with her.

08:40.668 --> 08:42.602
And I'm helping her
through her anguish.

08:42.669 --> 08:44.935
What do you know about anguish?

08:46.240 --> 08:48.209
I live with you and Dad.

08:51.479 --> 08:52.742
Finally back.

08:52.813 --> 08:56.341
Hi. So, what are you and Al
gonna do today?

08:56.417 --> 08:59.683
Oh. First we have
a strategy meeting here.

08:59.754 --> 09:01.192
Then this afternoon
we're off to Zug Island.

09:01.222 --> 09:04.283
The Port Authority is gonna have him
christen his own ship.

09:04.358 --> 09:05.621
How did you come up with that?

09:05.693 --> 09:09.960
It's amazing. He's got a big appeal
among dock workers ages 19 to 47.

09:11.599 --> 09:14.660
I wonder who they latch onto
when they turn 48?

09:15.569 --> 09:17.003
Andy Rooney.

09:18.405 --> 09:20.465
- Knock-knock! Hi!
- Hi, Al.

09:20.541 --> 09:22.101
- Honey, I'll see you guys later.
- Bye.

09:22.209 --> 09:23.438
- Bye.
- See you later.

09:23.511 --> 09:25.571
Okay, Al.
I have your sailor suit all pressed.

09:25.646 --> 09:27.012
Are you excited, or what?

09:27.081 --> 09:29.414
Well, there's something else
I'm even more excited about.

09:29.483 --> 09:30.781
Come on.

09:30.851 --> 09:32.877
I've added a new member to our team.

09:32.953 --> 09:35.388
- I've hired a manager.
- A what?

09:35.456 --> 09:37.618
Now, now, come on!
You're a great coach.

09:37.725 --> 09:40.889
Now I've brought someone in
to run the ball club. All right!

09:40.961 --> 09:43.768
Well, Al, we don't need a manager.
I lined up a great gig for you today.

09:43.798 --> 09:45.096
You're christening a ship.

09:45.166 --> 09:46.998
It's a trash barge.

09:47.068 --> 09:48.730
It's a slag barge.

09:49.436 --> 09:51.268
It's a Cadillac of waste products.

09:51.338 --> 09:54.103
Well, let's see what my manager has
to say about that, you know?

09:54.208 --> 09:56.973
He's coming over.
I invited him to our strategy session.

09:57.044 --> 09:59.741
- He's coming here?
- Yeah. Yeah, his name is Roy Becker.

09:59.814 --> 10:02.283
You're gonna love him. He's smart.
He's savvy.

10:02.349 --> 10:04.181
He's got a great sense of humor.

10:04.251 --> 10:05.810
What are Roy Becker's credentials?

10:05.886 --> 10:09.254
Well, he's president of
Roy Becker and Associates.

10:11.325 --> 10:13.692
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I know that name.

10:13.794 --> 10:16.730
Didn't he use to manage that other
cable guy, <i>Fishin' with Freddie?</i>

10:16.797 --> 10:19.699
Might have.
He handles a lot of big stars.

10:21.602 --> 10:23.969
There he is. Coming! Coming!

10:25.072 --> 10:27.234
Hey, superstar!
What's happening, baby?

10:27.308 --> 10:28.579
- Hey!
- There he is. Tim Taylor.

10:28.609 --> 10:29.907
How are you, my man?

10:29.977 --> 10:31.315
Hey. Roy Becker. Nice to meet you.

10:31.345 --> 10:33.473
- Hey, Roy.
- Hey, nice pad you got here.

10:33.547 --> 10:36.984
You know, I used to live around here
then I made something of myself.

10:37.051 --> 10:38.679
I'm just kidding.

10:39.186 --> 10:41.348
He's got a great sense of humor.

10:41.422 --> 10:43.323
I can't wait to see it.

10:44.625 --> 10:45.684
Hey, you want some coffee?

10:45.759 --> 10:48.854
Coffee? No. No coffee for me.
It makes me hyper.

10:49.296 --> 10:51.959
I'm here for one thing
and I'm here for one thing only.

10:52.066 --> 10:54.501
And that's to take Al to the top.

10:55.102 --> 10:59.233
This is the greatest day of my life!
I got my manager. I got my coach.

10:59.306 --> 11:00.330
- Yeah!
- Look out, world!

11:00.407 --> 11:02.376
Here comes Team Borland!

11:03.677 --> 11:06.044
Can't wait for that team physical, huh?

11:09.917 --> 11:12.944
Okay, fellas. Now, let's talk game plan.

11:13.020 --> 11:16.684
As I understand it, Taylor's got you
peddling faucets and metal garbage.

11:16.757 --> 11:18.487
Which is fine. Don't get me wrong.

11:18.559 --> 11:21.290
But now it's time to move up
to the major leagues.

11:21.362 --> 11:22.386
Major leagues?

11:22.463 --> 11:26.230
National commercials.
I'm talking an M.O.W.

11:26.333 --> 11:28.859
M.O.W.? A mow?
What will I be mowing?

11:30.337 --> 11:32.306
M.O.W. is a Movie of the Week.

11:32.406 --> 11:33.533
I'm gonna be in the movies?

11:33.607 --> 11:35.667
Al, you're a big hit with women, baby.

11:35.743 --> 11:39.908
I can get you on the Lifetime Channel
playing opposite Morgan Fairchild.

11:39.980 --> 11:42.142
Morgan Fairchild? I love her!

11:42.249 --> 11:44.309
- Wait, wait. Reality check. Come on!
- What?

11:44.385 --> 11:46.320
This is a pitch man. He's not an actor.

11:46.387 --> 11:48.151
Actor-shmactor!

11:48.255 --> 11:50.417
He'll act happy when he sees
the money rolling in, huh?

11:50.524 --> 11:52.288
Oh, boy!

11:52.760 --> 11:54.490
What are you leading him on
for here, Roy?

11:54.562 --> 11:56.531
I'm not leading him on.
Hey, look, Taylor.

11:56.597 --> 11:58.498
If he doesn't make money,
I don't make money.

11:58.565 --> 12:01.296
And if I don't make money,
I'm back living in this neighborhood.

12:01.368 --> 12:02.927
I did it again!

12:04.672 --> 12:06.368
Why are you being
such a doubting Thomas?

12:06.440 --> 12:08.272
You know, the big time is beckoning!

12:08.342 --> 12:11.312
So are 150 slag workers
who want to see you in a sailor suit.

12:11.412 --> 12:12.483
Yeah? Well, they're out of luck.

12:12.513 --> 12:14.752
Let me tell you right now, Al,
I don't want this going to your head,

12:14.782 --> 12:16.250
but garbage is beneath you.

12:16.317 --> 12:18.286
- You think so?
- I know so! Blow them off!

12:18.385 --> 12:19.757
I tell you what.
You come have lunch with me.

12:19.787 --> 12:21.592
I got a big commercial director
I want to introduce you to.

12:21.622 --> 12:23.727
Come on. Come on. I'm telling you,
you can make some money here.

12:23.757 --> 12:26.192
Wait, wait, wait.
We made a promise to Local 299.

12:26.260 --> 12:28.532
And the Local doesn't like it
when you break their promises.

12:28.562 --> 12:31.135
You know what? You want to dress up
like Popeye for the rest of your life?

12:31.165 --> 12:33.037
Or do you want to make some money?
Come on. Let's go.

12:33.067 --> 12:35.593
I don't know what to do.
I'm so conflicted!

12:35.669 --> 12:37.908
Look, I'll make it easy for you.
You go with Roy or you go with me.

12:37.938 --> 12:41.636
And I think you know
what the responsible thing to do is.

12:41.709 --> 12:44.406
Obviously, you're gonna have
to fill in for me.

12:44.478 --> 12:46.709
And thank you!
You were a great coach.

12:46.780 --> 12:50.012
Thanks, Taylor. You're a good man.
Beautiful house.

12:55.055 --> 12:57.615
And then he said, "Well,
why didn't you tell me that before?"

12:57.758 --> 13:00.057
And I said,
"Well, I thought that it was obvious."

13:00.127 --> 13:02.687
And he said,
"Well, it wasn't obvious to me."

13:02.796 --> 13:04.765
Isn't it obvious to you?

13:05.065 --> 13:06.124
Huh?

13:08.102 --> 13:10.071
I asked if it was obvious to you.

13:10.170 --> 13:12.139
It doesn't matter what I think.

13:12.206 --> 13:15.768
Just keep sharing your feelings
and I'll keep listening.

13:15.843 --> 13:19.007
Well, I'd really like to know
what you think.

13:19.113 --> 13:21.173
Well, I hurt when you hurt.

13:23.384 --> 13:26.684
What are you talking about?
I'm not hurting.

13:26.754 --> 13:28.780
Well, then I'm not either.

13:29.556 --> 13:33.516
Mark, I want you to tell me one thing
that I just talked about.

13:33.594 --> 13:35.756
You used the word "Obvious."

13:37.197 --> 13:38.426
That's what I thought.

13:38.499 --> 13:40.730
You know, you're even worse
than my boyfriend.

13:40.801 --> 13:43.862
At least he's honest
about not listening to me.

13:47.007 --> 13:49.169
I sympathize with your needs!

13:54.214 --> 13:58.242
Well, Brad, thanks to you,
Erica hates me.

13:58.952 --> 14:01.581
- What?
- Your stupid advice backfired.

14:01.655 --> 14:05.217
I should never have pretended
to care about her feelings.

14:06.026 --> 14:07.517
So, you taught him that?

14:07.594 --> 14:10.428
Look, I'm sorry, Mom.
I know you're disappointed.

14:10.497 --> 14:14.161
But if it makes you feel any better,
I hurt when you hurt.

14:16.036 --> 14:19.473
That's it. I'm canceling
your subscription to <i>Sassy.</i>

14:33.320 --> 14:35.846
So, Captain, where's Tennille?

14:38.959 --> 14:42.123
Like I haven't heard that
from 6,500 longshoremen?

14:42.830 --> 14:46.130
Well, I thought Al was supposed to do
the entertaining.

14:46.200 --> 14:47.532
He was until he backed out

14:47.601 --> 14:50.264
on the advice of his new manager,
Roy Becker.

14:50.337 --> 14:53.501
Roy Becker. I know that name.

14:53.574 --> 14:57.534
Didn't he use to live in this
neighborhood before he made it big?

14:58.445 --> 14:59.743
All the work I did for Al,

14:59.813 --> 15:02.544
he just forgets about me
and picks another guy.

15:02.616 --> 15:04.585
That is terrible. It doesn't sound like Al.

15:09.556 --> 15:11.388
Ahoy. Promenade deck.

15:14.495 --> 15:17.226
Oh, hi, Al. You need a day off?

15:17.664 --> 15:20.224
Well, why... Get out of town!

15:22.102 --> 15:24.128
All right. Well, tell...

15:24.605 --> 15:26.836
Okay. All right. Thanks. Bye.

15:28.408 --> 15:29.569
What was that about?

15:29.643 --> 15:31.669
They're shooting a Movie of the Week
here in town.

15:31.745 --> 15:34.510
He's got a bit part
with Morgan Fairchild.

15:34.915 --> 15:36.281
I love her!

15:40.020 --> 15:41.852
You can start as early
as you want, Wilson.

15:41.922 --> 15:44.824
But I'm still gonna kick butt
in that Christmas lighting contest.

15:44.892 --> 15:47.259
No. This is not for Christmas, Tim.

15:47.361 --> 15:51.526
Are you familiar with who inspired
the Indian festival of Deepawali?

15:52.299 --> 15:56.395
I'm still wondering who put the bop
in the bop-she-bop-she-bop.

15:56.470 --> 15:58.302
Well, probably the same
person who put the ram

15:58.372 --> 16:00.739
in the ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong.

16:01.208 --> 16:03.677
You want to know who put Al
in a Movie of the Week

16:03.744 --> 16:05.645
with Morgan Fairchild?

16:05.712 --> 16:08.079
Morgan Fairchild? I love her!

16:10.417 --> 16:13.478
Well, good going, Tim.
You are quite a coach.

16:13.554 --> 16:15.523
Al hired a professional manager.

16:15.622 --> 16:16.920
Well, good for Al.

16:16.990 --> 16:19.482
- He fired me.
- Bad for you.

16:19.560 --> 16:21.722
Don't feel bad for me, I feel bad for Al.

16:21.795 --> 16:23.634
The overnight sensation
who's appearing in a movie

16:23.664 --> 16:25.428
with Morgan Fairchild?

16:25.499 --> 16:28.469
I'm not jealous or anything.
I just think he's moving too fast.

16:28.569 --> 16:30.936
It's like Frankenstein loose on the world

16:31.004 --> 16:33.735
without his doctor by his side,
you know?

16:34.208 --> 16:36.973
- What was the doctor's name?
- Frankenstein.

16:38.712 --> 16:40.374
They were related?

16:41.815 --> 16:43.855
You know, Tim, I can understand
your concern for Al.

16:43.917 --> 16:48.082
But I'm also reminded of
the Persian writer Nasir-i Khusraw.

16:48.188 --> 16:52.956
He said, "Though God creates
the mother, the breast and the milk,

16:53.060 --> 16:56.792
"the children must draw for themselves
their mother's milk."

17:00.334 --> 17:03.771
Wilson, you just gave me
12 horrible images.

17:06.106 --> 17:09.133
No, no, no, no. I'm just saying,
just as the child learns self-reliance

17:09.209 --> 17:10.540
by separating from his mother,

17:10.611 --> 17:13.911
so the assistant learns
by separating from the Tool Man.

17:13.981 --> 17:18.316
Maybe what Al needs is protection
and support so he's not left hanging.

17:18.385 --> 17:21.116
So I'll just buy him a sturdy jockstrap.

17:22.256 --> 17:24.589
Hello, horrible image number 13.

17:28.095 --> 17:30.564
Scene 223 Baker. Take 15.

17:31.565 --> 17:33.329
And action!

17:34.368 --> 17:36.701
You're leaving me for my sister?

17:37.638 --> 17:38.970
Which one?

17:39.039 --> 17:41.008
The one carrying my baby.

17:43.343 --> 17:46.245
Get out! Get out and never come back!

18:00.627 --> 18:04.189
Great news. I've snaked the toilet
and you're good to go.

18:09.169 --> 18:10.933
Thank you, Gerard.

18:12.105 --> 18:14.973
Now, what have you got
for a broken heart?

18:16.009 --> 18:19.969
Hey, Maggie! What's the matter?
You can tell Gerard.

18:20.080 --> 18:22.447
- Oh, I'm sorry. I...
- Cut!

18:22.549 --> 18:24.848
The woman is emotionally devastated

18:24.918 --> 18:29.288
and you come bouncing in and salute
her like Gomer Pyle on a sugar high?

18:29.890 --> 18:31.518
Well, golly!

18:33.293 --> 18:34.293
What are you doing here?

18:34.361 --> 18:36.728
Just here to support Borland.
How's he doing?

18:36.797 --> 18:39.699
I had more fun
at my last prostate examination.

18:41.501 --> 18:46.667
Why don't you let me work with him
for just a second? Thanks. Thanks.

18:47.841 --> 18:51.972
Al, you know, I am really enjoying
playing opposite you.

18:52.045 --> 18:54.810
Oh, wow! Thank you, Morgan Fairchild!

18:55.816 --> 18:57.842
No. Please just call me Morgan.

18:57.918 --> 19:03.789
You know, Al, you have this reality
that I just find so exciting.

19:04.624 --> 19:09.187
And if you could tap into that reality,

19:10.497 --> 19:14.332
I could respond very passionately.

19:15.636 --> 19:17.332
Do you understand?

19:23.010 --> 19:26.469
All right, everybody, let's go again.
We'll take it from Gerard's entrance.

19:27.848 --> 19:29.009
Action!

19:33.120 --> 19:36.682
Great news. I've snaked the toilet
and you're good to go.

19:39.326 --> 19:41.022
Thank you, Gerard.

19:41.795 --> 19:46.062
Now, what have you got
for a broken heart?

19:48.235 --> 19:49.999
- Oh, Morgan...
- Cut!

19:51.705 --> 19:53.264
Get me a new Gerard.

19:53.373 --> 19:54.397
Borland, you're fired.

19:54.474 --> 19:56.636
Hey, get me Freddie, the fish guy.

19:56.710 --> 20:00.044
Wait a minute. You're replacing Al
with a guy that bobs for bass?

20:00.113 --> 20:01.218
Let me see if I can get him
on the phone.

20:01.248 --> 20:03.376
You can't do this.
He put his trust in you.

20:03.450 --> 20:05.976
You know, Taylor,
it's times like this I hate myself.

20:06.052 --> 20:09.511
But then I buy myself a new suit
and I feel terrific.

20:09.589 --> 20:11.389
- By the way, who represents you?
- Well, I...

20:11.425 --> 20:14.725
Hey, Frederico! Hey!
How's the fish biting? Hey, baby, yeah!

20:14.795 --> 20:17.287
Hey, Al. Hey.

20:17.364 --> 20:18.696
When did you get here?

20:18.765 --> 20:20.170
I got here in time to see
your last two takes.

20:20.200 --> 20:21.238
They're good. It's good stuff.

20:21.268 --> 20:23.294
Time to see me get fired.

20:23.370 --> 20:24.875
Well, that's okay.
I mean, the last take was good.

20:24.905 --> 20:26.743
The way you committed to the salute,
kind of half-salute.

20:26.773 --> 20:28.945
It was kind of funny stuff.
I mean, you were going with it.

20:28.975 --> 20:32.537
No, maybe you're right.
Maybe I'm just not an actor.

20:32.646 --> 20:34.205
Maybe not now.
You take a few classes.

20:34.314 --> 20:38.183
The next thing you know, you'll be back
in Morgan Fairchild's arms.

20:38.885 --> 20:43.152
I just...
I guess I tried to fly too high too fast.

20:43.223 --> 20:45.351
Gravity is a cruel mistress.

20:46.993 --> 20:49.428
Your mom probably taught you that.

20:52.032 --> 20:55.935
I should've been happy with the career
path we were working on, you know?

20:56.002 --> 20:58.631
There's no shame
in making longshoremen happy.

20:58.705 --> 21:00.674
At least not in this state.

21:00.740 --> 21:04.040
You know, it doesn't matter
that I work with Morgan Fairchild.

21:04.111 --> 21:05.977
You know, the important thing is that

21:06.046 --> 21:08.538
I have a good friend like you.
You know?

21:08.615 --> 21:10.948
Because when push comes to shove,
you know, you're there.

21:11.017 --> 21:12.144
- Well...
- Al.

21:12.219 --> 21:14.085
Yes, Morgan Fairchild?

21:14.788 --> 21:19.021
I am so sorry about this.
May I have your autograph?

21:20.393 --> 21:22.953
You... You want my autograph?

21:23.463 --> 21:25.335
Well, actually, it's not for me.
It's for my dad.

21:25.365 --> 21:27.732
He's a huge fan of <i>Tool Time.</i>

21:27.801 --> 21:30.828
Well, he probably wants mine, too. Hi.
I'm Tim the Tool Man.

21:30.904 --> 21:33.271
Hi. No, he didn't mention you.

21:34.775 --> 21:36.004
Thanks.

21:36.076 --> 21:39.706
I, on the other hand,
am a huge fan of yours, honey.

21:46.219 --> 21:48.586
Morgan Fairchild. I love her!

21:53.360 --> 21:55.693
- Hey, Cleotis!
- Hey, Mr. Taylor!

22:00.800 --> 22:03.133
I've branched out into endorsements.

22:03.203 --> 22:07.265
You're endorsing dung. That's dung.
That's not dung.

22:07.874 --> 22:10.241
You know, Tim, I can understand
your concerns about Al.

22:10.343 --> 22:15.509
But I'm also reminded of the
Persian writer, Kooty-koogy-googy.

22:15.949 --> 22:17.850
- Koogy-googy-oogy.
- What is his name?

22:18.305 --> 22:24.552
