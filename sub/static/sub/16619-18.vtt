WEBVTT

00:00.804 --> 00:02.171
Previously on "Quantico"...

00:02.182 --> 00:04.148
This team was created to put an end

00:04.151 --> 00:06.109
to the rogue group of
agents within the CIA

00:06.112 --> 00:09.472
working on behalf of eight
power players in America.

00:09.475 --> 00:10.452
Sooner or later,

00:10.455 --> 00:12.376
the Collaborators will
stage another attack,

00:12.378 --> 00:14.211
and when they do, your
mother will be done.

00:14.213 --> 00:17.080
When she resigns, we all
know who's next in succession.

00:17.082 --> 00:18.248
Henry Roarke.

00:18.250 --> 00:19.883
Caleb, it's Shelby.

00:19.885 --> 00:21.685
I think your family needs you right now.

00:21.687 --> 00:23.487
My instinct is gone.

00:23.489 --> 00:25.221
Help me be who I was.

00:25.224 --> 00:27.124
I don't know if I can trust you.

00:27.126 --> 00:29.726
Why does the FBI have you
flagged as a Russian asset?

00:29.728 --> 00:32.662
Turn yourself in for a
bombing they said I did?

00:32.665 --> 00:34.164
I'll be you in custody,

00:34.166 --> 00:36.500
and you'll be me, free in
the world, helping fix it.

00:36.502 --> 00:38.268
I don't want to die for this. I'm sorry.

00:38.270 --> 00:40.170
Goodbye, Harry.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:50.702 --> 00:52.509
Tread water, 20 minutes.

00:53.972 --> 00:55.671
You... You don't think this is overkill?

00:55.673 --> 00:58.074
I think you're spending way to
much energy asking questions,

00:58.076 --> 01:00.343
when you should be treading water.

01:09.684 --> 01:12.116
I thought we were
gonna hone my instincts.

01:12.118 --> 01:13.818
I already know how to swim.

01:13.820 --> 01:16.509
This exercise isn't about
what you already know.

01:16.512 --> 01:19.222
It's about pushing your
physical limitations so far

01:19.225 --> 01:21.092
that you have no choice
but to use your instincts

01:21.094 --> 01:22.427
instead of what you've learned.

01:22.429 --> 01:24.845
So, this is your "student
becomes the teacher" moment, huh?

01:25.134 --> 01:28.018
Owen, you're not a teacher anymore.

01:28.020 --> 01:30.921
And I'm not a student, either.

01:30.923 --> 01:33.924
The CIA values brains over body,

01:33.926 --> 01:35.993
but the FBI knows that a stronger body

01:35.995 --> 01:37.327
makes for a stronger mind.

01:37.615 --> 01:39.715
Tread.

01:49.794 --> 01:52.434
Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on.

01:53.677 --> 01:55.312
If you were a Navy SEAL,

01:55.315 --> 01:57.108
I'd be shooting rubber bullets at you.

01:57.111 --> 01:59.270
- What does that teach you?
- How to duck.

02:03.389 --> 02:04.521
Good!

02:05.767 --> 02:07.333
Again.

02:07.335 --> 02:09.655
I think you're enjoying
this a little too much.

02:18.041 --> 02:20.008
All right, now swim across the water

02:20.010 --> 02:21.443
without coming up for air.

02:21.445 --> 02:22.611
- Go.
- Alex...

02:22.613 --> 02:25.046
Owen, your brain is
saying you can't do it,

02:25.048 --> 02:26.581
but your body will adapt.

02:26.583 --> 02:28.183
- Alex...
- Swim!

02:59.907 --> 03:02.341
You're still in your head...

03:02.343 --> 03:03.776
Thinking about how tired you are,

03:03.778 --> 03:05.144
how much the zip ties hurt.

03:05.146 --> 03:07.146
You're counting the minutes,
thinking about breathing.

03:07.148 --> 03:08.881
Yeah, well, breathing is important.

03:08.883 --> 03:11.717
Owen, you're so
convinced you can't do it

03:11.719 --> 03:12.985
that you've already given up.

03:12.987 --> 03:15.888
I'm not 25 anymore.

03:16.319 --> 03:17.852
Whatever I've learned, whatever I am,

03:17.854 --> 03:19.019
it's hard-wired now.

03:19.021 --> 03:20.821
It can't be written over in one day.

03:22.859 --> 03:25.826
Maybe that's why FBI
training lasts 20 weeks.

03:29.585 --> 03:32.664
Look, it's okay to quit.

03:32.667 --> 03:34.006
Or you can try again.

03:38.245 --> 03:40.045
I pulled some major
strings to get this...

03:40.047 --> 03:42.815
Raina's first 24 hours in FBI custody.

03:42.817 --> 03:45.612
She's being held in a
detention facility in D.C.,

03:45.615 --> 03:47.481
being treated like any
terror suspect would

03:47.483 --> 03:50.651
in that situation, which is not good.

03:50.653 --> 03:53.220
Preliminary interrogation
went nonstop for seven hours.

03:53.222 --> 03:54.889
She hasn't slept.

03:56.935 --> 03:58.301
She won't break.

03:58.303 --> 04:00.871
They won't stop until she does.

04:00.873 --> 04:04.134
Well, the sooner we take out
those who framed my sister,

04:04.137 --> 04:05.703
the sooner she'll be free.

04:06.779 --> 04:10.113
We've received reports of
hate crimes and protests

04:10.115 --> 04:12.616
over the veto of a
registry in multiple cities.

04:12.618 --> 04:15.580
Our latest poll says that
in the wake of the bombing...

04:15.583 --> 04:17.649
Nice shirt.

04:17.651 --> 04:19.701
Than ever before and
would even consider...

04:19.704 --> 04:21.320
Good morning.

04:21.322 --> 04:24.256
- How long you been up?
- Long enough to know

04:24.258 --> 04:26.859
your job is about to
get a little bit harder.

04:28.696 --> 04:30.729
Ugh.

04:34.238 --> 04:36.305
A matter of national security?

04:36.308 --> 04:38.808
All my texts are,
even the ones from you.

04:38.811 --> 04:40.310
Especially the ones from me.

04:42.214 --> 04:44.147
Can I have my shirt back, please?

04:44.149 --> 04:47.384
A non-denial denial.

04:47.386 --> 04:49.586
Well-played.

04:49.588 --> 04:51.721
Excuse me?

04:51.723 --> 04:53.857
Journalism 101...

04:53.859 --> 04:57.178
I asked if the text you got

04:57.181 --> 04:58.814
was a matter of national security.

04:58.816 --> 05:00.349
You say they all are,

05:00.351 --> 05:03.652
which didn't really answer the question.

05:03.654 --> 05:05.020
Or did it?

05:05.022 --> 05:07.590
I mean, if it wasn't a
matter of national security,

05:07.592 --> 05:10.757
then maybe you'd stay...

05:10.760 --> 05:12.595
and watch the news with me.

05:12.597 --> 05:14.330
Hmm.

05:17.135 --> 05:19.635
Uh, here.

05:29.090 --> 05:32.291
All right, I will give you a call.

05:33.796 --> 05:35.562
I'm sure you will.

05:55.773 --> 05:57.226
Hey, did we get a ping?

05:57.868 --> 06:00.569
Not a ping... pings.

06:02.537 --> 06:04.470
Yeah, the Collaborators have been busy.

06:04.472 --> 06:07.307
We got five pings in
the last five hours,

06:07.309 --> 06:09.642
all on procedures to be
implemented by law enforcement

06:09.644 --> 06:13.813
in the case of civil unrest,
in five different cities...

06:13.815 --> 06:17.850
Cleveland, Albany,
Detroit, El Paso, and Fargo.

06:17.852 --> 06:20.086
Each of those cities are
on high alert for riots

06:20.088 --> 06:21.587
due to active or imminent protests.

06:21.589 --> 06:22.989
I got an FBI "all agents" call.

06:22.991 --> 06:24.086
Well, what does that tell you?

06:24.088 --> 06:26.659
The Collaborators are planning
for a riot in one of those cities.

06:26.661 --> 06:27.994
Or planning to create it.

06:27.996 --> 06:29.495
It could be a bold chess move,

06:29.497 --> 06:31.631
fostering further instability
throughout the country.

06:31.633 --> 06:33.132
An outbreak of violence
in any of these cities...

06:33.134 --> 06:35.168
Would prove that America's
more divided than ever

06:35.170 --> 06:36.869
under your mom's watch.

06:36.871 --> 06:39.505
Do you really think they would
go so far as to create a riot?

06:39.507 --> 06:41.607
They don't have to create
it. These cities are primed.

06:41.609 --> 06:43.376
They just chose one and tip it over.

06:43.378 --> 06:44.401
We have to do something.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.879
They can't be allowed to
control the narrative like this.

06:46.881 --> 06:49.248
There's nothing to do.

06:49.250 --> 06:51.918
I've run every scenario, every move.

06:51.920 --> 06:54.087
Now, there is a point
in every chess match

06:54.089 --> 06:55.855
when the game is lost and
the loser doesn't know it.

06:55.857 --> 06:57.190
We're there.

06:57.192 --> 06:58.958
We are going to lose this game.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.793
This isn't a game.

07:00.795 --> 07:02.328
Everything's a game to someone.

07:02.330 --> 07:05.064
Wait. So... what, you want to give up?

07:05.066 --> 07:07.200
I don't want to, no.

07:07.202 --> 07:09.268
But when it comes to
strategy and execution,

07:09.270 --> 07:11.003
the Collaborators are
light-years ahead of us.

07:11.005 --> 07:13.272
Roarke moved a pawn
when he forced Claire

07:13.274 --> 07:15.508
to veto that registry, and look.

07:15.510 --> 07:18.644
Look at the result of
that one simple move.

07:18.646 --> 07:21.147
The country's on edge, which
is exactly what they wanted.

07:21.149 --> 07:22.749
They are building to an end game

07:22.751 --> 07:24.283
that we still don't understand,

07:24.285 --> 07:25.351
and we have no way to stop them.

07:25.353 --> 07:26.886
What, you're shutting us down?

07:26.888 --> 07:29.440
We have four faces on the
board, and two are dead.

07:29.443 --> 07:31.190
We are fighting the inevitable.

07:31.192 --> 07:33.893
Enough saying we can't. We have to.

07:33.895 --> 07:36.396
The country needs us.
My sister needs us.

07:39.134 --> 07:41.434
We can't retreat like cowards.

07:41.436 --> 07:43.636
She's right.

07:43.638 --> 07:45.238
We need to find something new.

07:45.240 --> 07:47.607
I'm tired of playing chess.

07:47.609 --> 07:49.008
I want to take these guys out

07:49.010 --> 07:50.810
and destroy whatever agenda they have.

07:50.812 --> 07:53.012
Look, Clay, I know you
can't see a way through,

07:53.014 --> 07:54.614
but that doesn't mean we can't find one.

07:54.616 --> 07:55.982
So, what'd you have in mind?

07:55.984 --> 07:57.984
Figure out which cities
they're targeting,

07:57.986 --> 07:59.986
then Shelby, Nimah,
and I go in there as FBI

07:59.988 --> 08:01.687
and make sure they
can't execute their plan.

08:01.689 --> 08:04.062
Roarke has stepped out of
the shadows... big deal.

08:04.065 --> 08:06.628
It's our turn now.

08:06.631 --> 08:09.562
Who wants to take out a Collaborator?

08:09.564 --> 08:14.037
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

08:14.474 --> 08:16.894
With Clay refusing to
help, we're on our own.

08:16.897 --> 08:20.919
Cleveland, Albany,
Detroit, El Paso, Fargo...

08:20.922 --> 08:23.022
We know that the Collaborators
will incite violence

08:23.024 --> 08:24.591
in one of these five cities.

08:24.593 --> 08:27.093
Our job... figuring out
which one of these powder kegs

08:27.095 --> 08:28.761
is most likely to go off,

08:28.763 --> 08:30.697
get there, and stop it from happening.

08:32.667 --> 08:34.701
Hey, Nimah, anything?

08:34.703 --> 08:37.135
I've been reading about
the tensions in El Paso.

08:37.138 --> 08:38.404
No, I meant did you call anyone

08:38.405 --> 08:40.048
from when you were stationed there?

08:40.051 --> 08:41.450
Yes, of course.

08:41.452 --> 08:45.755
I'll do that now.

08:45.757 --> 08:47.867
Nimah.

08:52.034 --> 08:54.034
Remember that FSB thing with Sasha?

08:54.036 --> 08:56.303
Uh, yeah, of course.

08:56.305 --> 09:00.407
Well, I planted a bug in
her apartment this morning.

09:00.409 --> 09:01.475
Listen to this.

09:01.477 --> 09:08.684
_

09:08.687 --> 09:13.886
_

09:14.461 --> 09:15.894
That was an hour and a half ago.

09:18.365 --> 09:19.965
Earth to Nimah. Any thoughts?

09:21.135 --> 09:22.968
You know what you need to do.

09:25.358 --> 09:27.325
You'll cover for me?

09:27.327 --> 09:28.726
I'll be back.

09:28.728 --> 09:31.329
A massive protest is being
organized in Detroit tonight.

09:31.331 --> 09:33.264
So, an off-duty cop shot
an unarmed black youth

09:33.266 --> 09:35.466
outside a car show near 8 Mile.

09:35.469 --> 09:37.338
Case looks like it
might even go to trial.

09:37.340 --> 09:39.689
It's Black Lives Matter
versus the Thin Blue Line.

09:39.691 --> 09:41.758
Mm, interesting.

09:41.760 --> 09:42.859
Dig deeper.

09:42.861 --> 09:44.728
Yep.

09:44.873 --> 09:47.807
Alex, Native Americans have
been protesting land rights

09:47.809 --> 09:49.609
for six weeks straight in North Dakota

09:49.611 --> 09:52.578
against the U.S. Government's
plan to put in an oil pipeline.

09:52.580 --> 09:55.299
I found this in a sub-Reddit group...

09:55.302 --> 09:57.202
A recruitment call for
militia groups to aid

09:57.204 --> 09:59.171
the sheriff's department
in pushing protestors

09:59.173 --> 10:00.472
off the land.

10:00.760 --> 10:03.661
Mm, I think it'll take
too long to mobilize.

10:03.663 --> 10:05.963
I mean, if they were already there...

10:05.965 --> 10:07.465
I'll switch to Albany.

10:07.467 --> 10:08.833
Okay.

10:19.494 --> 10:21.127
Stop everything.

10:21.129 --> 10:22.962
Close your computers.

10:22.964 --> 10:25.698
Just turn it all off, trust me.

10:25.700 --> 10:27.000
What's going on?

10:27.002 --> 10:29.369
We're going about this all wrong.

10:29.371 --> 10:32.271
We're thinking it through,
we're applying rational thought.

10:32.642 --> 10:34.876
Terrorists don't think rationally.

10:34.878 --> 10:37.112
If it was that easy,
we would've won already.

10:37.114 --> 10:39.614
And what do you propose we
do, turn around three times

10:39.616 --> 10:42.484
and pin the tail on the map?

10:42.486 --> 10:44.886
Use our instincts.

10:44.888 --> 10:46.922
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

10:46.925 --> 10:48.058
And how do we do that?

10:48.060 --> 10:50.026
Okay, just go with me, okay?

10:50.028 --> 10:54.131
What is the best story,
the best narrative?

10:54.133 --> 10:57.601
And don't think about the data,
just tell me the best story.

10:57.972 --> 10:59.037
Where's Ryan?

10:59.039 --> 11:01.473
He had to deal with
some personal matters.

11:01.475 --> 11:03.976
Okay. Owen, don't think.

11:03.978 --> 11:05.444
- Just tell me.
- Cleveland.

11:05.446 --> 11:06.612
Why?

11:06.614 --> 11:08.881
Um, a murder case has been sitting

11:08.883 --> 11:10.660
on a hung jury for the last three days.

11:10.663 --> 11:12.163
The judge won't allow for a mistrial.

11:12.165 --> 11:14.465
He's threatening an Allen Charge,

11:14.467 --> 11:16.868
you know, to force the jury
to decide one way or the other.

11:16.870 --> 11:18.403
Everyone in the city's on edge.

11:18.405 --> 11:19.971
- That's the home invasion, right?
- Yep.

11:19.973 --> 11:21.372
A homeless man broke into a house,

11:21.374 --> 11:23.268
sexually assaulted and killed the wife.

11:23.271 --> 11:25.178
Her husband came home
as it was happening,

11:25.180 --> 11:26.312
shot and killed the intruder.

11:26.314 --> 11:27.714
So, why is that our story?

11:27.716 --> 11:30.683
'Cause the gun the homeowner
used was obtained illegally.

11:30.685 --> 11:32.418
And because he used an unregistered gun

11:32.420 --> 11:33.853
he bought from an unlicensed gun dealer,

11:33.855 --> 11:36.234
he's facing criminal charges,
and if he's convicted,

11:36.237 --> 11:37.870
his children go to foster care.

11:37.872 --> 11:39.104
All of this because
of an executive order

11:39.106 --> 11:40.873
President Todd signed, at the urging

11:40.875 --> 11:42.975
of then-Vice President Claire Haas.

11:42.977 --> 11:45.715
He's right. Nothing else touches
directly on the President.

11:45.718 --> 11:47.884
If the defendant's found
guilty, it's gonna be

11:47.887 --> 11:50.082
a big public-opinion nightmare for her.

11:50.453 --> 11:53.020
This is our case. This is the story!

11:53.022 --> 11:54.084
Look at this.

11:54.087 --> 11:56.424
The police have been on
high alert since they learned

11:56.426 --> 11:58.426
the judge levied that Allen Charge.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.050
Sorry, can I ask you what that is?

12:00.052 --> 12:04.132
It's when a judge orders a jury
to deliberate until a set time,

12:04.135 --> 12:06.002
at which point, they
have to present a verdict.

12:06.004 --> 12:06.959
They can't be hung.

12:06.962 --> 12:09.672
And they have to give a
decision by 6:00 today.

12:09.674 --> 12:11.174
Stands to reason that the Collaborators

12:11.176 --> 12:13.476
will probably use this time
to push the guilty verdict

12:13.478 --> 12:16.045
by influencing the jurors.

12:16.047 --> 12:18.181
Which means we need to
get to Cleveland now.

12:18.183 --> 12:21.450
And make sure a
not-guilty charge is read?

12:21.452 --> 12:24.287
You... We can't interfere with justice.

12:24.289 --> 12:25.688
We're not.

12:25.690 --> 12:28.090
We're gonna prove that they are.

12:28.461 --> 12:30.995
If we can prove that the
jurors were influenced,

12:30.997 --> 12:33.565
it's an automatic mistrial,
which it would've been anyway

12:33.567 --> 12:34.832
if the judge hadn't intervened.

12:34.957 --> 12:37.124
How do we get to Cleveland?

12:37.126 --> 12:38.926
The FBI "All Agents" call.

12:38.928 --> 12:41.080
The three of us will go,
and no one will be the wiser.

12:41.083 --> 12:43.247
And I'll provide backup from here.

12:43.250 --> 12:44.799
Okay, perfect.

12:44.801 --> 12:46.434
Wheels up in 30?

12:53.244 --> 12:56.746
You're leaving? We
just figured this out.

12:56.748 --> 12:58.281
I have a meeting at the White House.

12:58.283 --> 12:59.782
About?

12:59.784 --> 13:01.851
My personal business.

13:01.853 --> 13:04.831
You're gonna try to get her to
disband this team, aren't you?

13:05.326 --> 13:06.981
You've run a company, Shelby.

13:06.983 --> 13:08.683
You should know when a
deal isn't gonna make.

13:08.685 --> 13:10.618
And I know it's easier to walk away

13:10.620 --> 13:14.589
than lose more than you bargained for.

13:14.591 --> 13:16.958
- I'm late.
- I used to be like you.

13:16.960 --> 13:19.627
I liked to run when
someone disappointed me

13:19.630 --> 13:20.906
or things got too tough.

13:20.909 --> 13:22.676
Ask your brother... I did it to him.

13:22.678 --> 13:24.611
I'm not running.

13:24.613 --> 13:26.379
I just see what's coming.

13:38.144 --> 13:40.539
You kept me waiting
longer than I thought.

13:40.787 --> 13:42.420
No one is meeting you here.

13:42.422 --> 13:45.118
Oh, that's not true. You are.

13:45.121 --> 13:47.923
So, this is all just
for me, huh, the Russian?

13:47.926 --> 13:50.481
_

13:50.484 --> 13:52.231
_

13:52.234 --> 13:53.433
So, you don't trust me.

13:53.435 --> 13:54.534
I don't trust anyone.

13:54.536 --> 13:56.903
- Well, I trust you.
- No, you don't.

13:56.905 --> 13:58.472
You buy these in bulk?

13:58.474 --> 14:00.707
How many girls are you
listening to right now?

14:00.709 --> 14:02.476
Look, I can go.

14:02.478 --> 14:04.177
I'll make you a deal...

14:04.179 --> 14:06.313
One time only.

14:06.315 --> 14:08.660
Any details about me you need,

14:08.663 --> 14:11.931
any documents or photos you want,

14:11.933 --> 14:13.966
ask now.

14:13.968 --> 14:15.768
I like you, Sasha. You intrigue me.

14:15.770 --> 14:16.969
Apparently.

14:16.971 --> 14:19.238
But I wouldn't trust
anything you give me.

14:21.242 --> 14:24.543
Then get it for yourself.

14:24.545 --> 14:26.279
This is a key to my apartment.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.553
You know I've been here all morning.

14:27.555 --> 14:28.865
You've been listening yourself.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.443
I haven't touch a thing
since you left, so go.

14:31.446 --> 14:34.532
Rummage through the place,
see for yourself who I am.

14:34.535 --> 14:35.701
No, I don't need to do that.

14:35.704 --> 14:37.904
Yes, you do.

14:37.906 --> 14:41.141
I like you, too, okay?

14:41.143 --> 14:44.211
And I understand why you
wouldn't trust me or anyone.

14:44.213 --> 14:47.381
I just want to show you why you can

14:47.383 --> 14:50.617
so we can move on to the real part.

14:50.619 --> 14:52.519
Okay?

14:57.618 --> 15:00.685
- Hi.
- Hello.

15:00.687 --> 15:03.722
Ah, the embrace of the prodigal son.

15:03.724 --> 15:05.423
Mi hermano!

15:05.425 --> 15:07.225
It's good to see you!

15:07.227 --> 15:08.627
ÿQue pasa?

15:08.752 --> 15:10.318
Caleb, what are you doing here?

15:10.320 --> 15:12.620
I'm just popping through
on my way back from Tulum.

15:12.622 --> 15:15.356
Oh, hey, I got something for you.

15:18.306 --> 15:20.540
Given the surprises
inside, I wouldn't open it

15:20.543 --> 15:21.910
in front of the Secret Service.

15:21.913 --> 15:23.443
What did you do?

15:23.445 --> 15:25.190
Well, hey, if you
passed better drug laws,

15:25.193 --> 15:27.093
I wouldn't have to
resort to paper mÃ¢ché.

15:27.095 --> 15:28.828
I see your sense of
humor hasn't matured.

15:28.830 --> 15:31.564
Well, your old enough for the
both of us, don't you think?

15:31.566 --> 15:32.632
I'm here on business.

15:32.634 --> 15:34.534
I don't see the Super Friends.

15:34.536 --> 15:36.043
You told him?

15:36.046 --> 15:37.983
We're a family... We
don't have any secrets.

15:37.985 --> 15:40.485
Then, why did I find out that Shelby's

15:40.487 --> 15:42.654
on your task force from Shelby?

15:42.656 --> 15:44.890
- You talked to her?
- You care?

15:44.892 --> 15:46.603
Clay, what's going on?

15:46.606 --> 15:48.873
Really, mother? In front of him?

15:48.875 --> 15:49.941
You called this meeting.

15:49.943 --> 15:51.142
I shouldn't have come.

15:51.144 --> 15:53.077
Something you probably say every time,

15:53.079 --> 15:54.478
but you're here now.

15:54.480 --> 15:57.615
So, ugh, loosen up!

15:57.617 --> 15:59.417
You know, say what's on your mind.

16:00.534 --> 16:02.000
Trust.

16:05.938 --> 16:08.071
The task force can't
stop the Collaborators.

16:08.073 --> 16:09.739
I'm afraid if we continue
trying, it will cost you

16:09.741 --> 16:12.676
everything that you
have worked so hard for.

16:12.678 --> 16:16.680
So I think the only
option is to stop trying

16:16.682 --> 16:20.784
to prevent what's coming
and prepare for it instead.

16:24.558 --> 16:26.024
What?

16:26.026 --> 16:29.461
You know, that just sounded practical.

16:29.463 --> 16:31.363
Yeah, well, that's because it is.

16:31.365 --> 16:34.066
Well, you know what isn't practical?

16:34.068 --> 16:38.103
A group of rich white men
trying to topple democracy.

16:38.105 --> 16:39.671
See, you can't fight fire with fire.

16:39.673 --> 16:42.230
That's exactly what they expect.

16:42.233 --> 16:44.433
I mean, you gotta fight it with kittens

16:44.436 --> 16:46.870
or mercury or the concept of time.

16:46.872 --> 16:49.339
Caleb's right. These
people are unpredictable.

16:49.341 --> 16:51.141
Your strategy was helpful for a while,

16:51.143 --> 16:54.711
but if it isn't helpful anymore,
then we should change tack.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.102
Look, I know what we're up against,

16:56.104 --> 16:58.204
which is why I put my
presidency on the line.

16:58.206 --> 17:00.139
And if you really believed
me when I said that,

17:00.141 --> 17:03.576
you wouldn't be here
trying to talk me out of it!

17:03.578 --> 17:06.079
Or maybe I was wrong
to ask you to run this.

17:14.558 --> 17:16.758
Listen. These are my friends.

17:16.760 --> 17:18.126
I know them. I can help.

17:18.128 --> 17:19.973
I'm not letting you
anywhere near my team.

17:19.976 --> 17:22.476
Well, you just said that
you were running away,

17:22.478 --> 17:24.345
so you're not gonna be
near your team anyway,

17:24.347 --> 17:25.980
or do they not teach physics at Harvard?

17:25.982 --> 17:28.949
Are you actually considering this? Fine.

17:28.951 --> 17:31.218
But when he fails,
because he always does,

17:31.220 --> 17:32.419
and you pay the price...

17:32.421 --> 17:34.666
Then you won't be here. Got it.

17:34.669 --> 17:36.536
No, I won't be able to fix it.

17:36.538 --> 17:39.205
Well, you haven't been able
to fix it thus far, have you?

17:44.513 --> 17:46.179
I want a meeting. Now.

17:46.181 --> 17:47.747
I want to call a truce.

17:47.749 --> 17:49.182
Get here before 3:00.

17:49.184 --> 17:51.017
I'll be there.

17:53.145 --> 17:54.211
Anything?

17:54.214 --> 17:55.622
You will never guess who wants

17:55.624 --> 17:57.657
some face-time with you this afternoon.

18:13.164 --> 18:14.597
What's the plan?

18:14.599 --> 18:16.666
Well, first we convince
the special agent in charge

18:16.668 --> 18:17.900
that we're here to help.

18:17.902 --> 18:19.769
I don't think that's gonna be possible.

18:21.942 --> 18:23.308
Welcome to Cleveland.

18:25.675 --> 18:27.587
If I were to debrief
you, I would tell you

18:27.590 --> 18:29.486
that we are following multiple threats,

18:29.489 --> 18:30.888
none of which are credible enough

18:30.891 --> 18:33.228
to close off the public space
surrounding the courthouse,

18:33.231 --> 18:35.617
which is where people
are gonna come to protest.

18:35.620 --> 18:38.032
If there is a guilty verdict,

18:38.035 --> 18:40.569
we are expecting violent reactions.

18:40.571 --> 18:42.471
These are people who like guns

18:42.473 --> 18:44.707
in a state with concealed-carry laws.

18:44.710 --> 18:45.776
Roll back for a second.

18:45.778 --> 18:48.445
"If" you were gonna debrief us?

18:48.447 --> 18:50.180
You three didn't come here for a call.

18:50.182 --> 18:51.949
We're here to work, Miranda.

18:51.951 --> 18:54.118
For me, reporting to me?

18:54.120 --> 18:56.954
Sitting in a room doing
exactly what I say?

18:58.893 --> 19:00.192
That's what I thought.

19:00.194 --> 19:02.194
I thought you were
in FBI custody, Raina.

19:02.196 --> 19:05.464
- That's not...
- Raina's...

19:05.466 --> 19:07.478
You sent Nimah to jail?

19:07.481 --> 19:08.680
I didn't want her to go,

19:08.682 --> 19:11.828
but we felt that it's
safer for me like this.

19:11.831 --> 19:12.930
I don't care.

19:12.932 --> 19:14.298
I want nothing to do with it.

19:14.300 --> 19:16.667
I barely got this assignment,
and I'm not about to lose it

19:16.669 --> 19:18.602
because you can't play by the rules.

19:18.604 --> 19:21.550
Oh, you want to lecture us
about playing by the rules?

19:21.553 --> 19:23.520
I didn't ask the FBI to cover up

19:23.522 --> 19:25.555
what happened at the G20, but they did.

19:25.557 --> 19:27.157
And because they did,

19:27.159 --> 19:30.004
I have a last chance to save my career.

19:30.007 --> 19:31.740
And the only pathway to do that

19:31.742 --> 19:33.676
is to follow the straight and narrow,

19:33.678 --> 19:35.778
and I can't possibly
do that with you guys

19:35.780 --> 19:38.492
running off the reservation
like you usually do.

19:38.495 --> 19:39.727
You want to help?

19:39.729 --> 19:41.763
Don't leave the building.

19:41.765 --> 19:43.765
Start manning the phones.

19:43.767 --> 19:46.968
And report any incidents
of unrest to me.

19:48.317 --> 19:51.151
I was trying to protect
my sister's wishes.

19:51.153 --> 19:52.719
You could've trusted us.

19:52.721 --> 19:56.134
We brought you along thinking
you were an FBI agent.

19:56.137 --> 19:58.704
Look, I went to Quantico.
I know what I'm doing.

19:58.706 --> 20:00.907
I sure hope so, because
we'll need to operate

20:00.909 --> 20:02.442
under Miranda's nose to get the proof

20:02.444 --> 20:03.843
that gets us a mistrial.

20:03.845 --> 20:04.944
All right, juror names

20:04.946 --> 20:06.879
should be easy to
find on the FBI server.

20:06.881 --> 20:09.382
Setting up a secure site
to send names to the bunker.

20:09.384 --> 20:11.362
All right, Owen and
Ryan can do a deep dive

20:11.365 --> 20:13.432
into the jurors, see
if there's any evidence

20:13.434 --> 20:14.566
that they've been compromised,

20:14.568 --> 20:16.501
evidence we can use to question them.

20:16.503 --> 20:18.770
As FBI agents, we just say

20:18.772 --> 20:20.472
we're investigating credible threats.

20:20.474 --> 20:21.606
What do we tell Miranda?

20:21.608 --> 20:22.574
Nothing.

20:22.576 --> 20:24.342
The less she knows, the better.

20:26.415 --> 20:29.049
Kelly Hughes... her mother
just moved to the top

20:29.051 --> 20:31.051
of the heart and lung
donor list two days ago.

20:31.053 --> 20:33.420
Maybe this is the Collaborators
giving her an incentive.

20:33.422 --> 20:35.889
My mother had an infection,
but as soon as it got better,

20:35.891 --> 20:37.402
they moved her up.

20:37.405 --> 20:39.172
Why does the FBI need to know this?

20:39.174 --> 20:40.473
Is she okay?

20:40.475 --> 20:43.042
Is the hospital under investigation?

20:43.044 --> 20:44.644
No, that's all I need.

20:44.646 --> 20:46.857
Lowell Shaw... A lot of phone calls

20:46.860 --> 20:49.328
from unknown numbers
since deliberation began.

20:49.330 --> 20:50.629
Could be blackmail.

20:50.631 --> 20:52.631
The blocked calls are from my daughter.

20:52.633 --> 20:55.155
I promised my wife I wouldn't
help her if she relapsed again,

20:55.158 --> 20:57.292
but she's my baby. What can I do?

20:57.294 --> 20:59.227
So, she calls asking for money.

20:59.229 --> 21:01.062
I know I should say no, but
her calls are the only way

21:01.064 --> 21:02.797
I know she's even still alive.

21:02.799 --> 21:04.187
I know I'm not supposed
to talk about the trial,

21:04.190 --> 21:06.457
but how am I supposed
to find this man guilty

21:06.459 --> 21:09.371
and take him away from his
kids when I know how that feels?

21:09.374 --> 21:11.341
Mitch Connor, juror number four.

21:11.343 --> 21:13.110
Just sold his house
for twice market value

21:13.112 --> 21:14.211
through a shell corp.

21:14.213 --> 21:16.313
Clever way to disguise a bribe.

21:16.315 --> 21:18.426
I told you... It was a windfall.

21:18.429 --> 21:19.995
The same buyer purchased half the block.

21:19.997 --> 21:21.831
He wanted to build a
hew housing development.

21:21.833 --> 21:23.632
I already explained all
of this in voir dire.

21:23.634 --> 21:24.934
Why do I have to do it again?

21:24.936 --> 21:28.115
These questions are for your
protection, sir, I assure you.

21:28.118 --> 21:30.752
Right, just like Judge Kaplan assured us

21:30.754 --> 21:32.309
there was no pressure when he imposed

21:32.312 --> 21:34.623
that unofficial
deadline for the verdict?

21:34.625 --> 21:36.335
Or the way he's been not-so-subtly

21:36.338 --> 21:37.804
steering us to a guilty verdict?

21:37.807 --> 21:40.875
Judge Kaplan is pressuring the jurors?

21:40.877 --> 21:43.878
I shouldn't be talking to you.

21:43.880 --> 21:45.446
No, you shouldn't.

21:51.299 --> 21:52.966
I thought Maxine was a lefty.

21:52.968 --> 21:55.401
What did you do?

21:55.403 --> 21:57.437
Reverted back to high school.

21:59.608 --> 22:03.510
YMCA, Children's Hospital,
Habitat for Humanity...

22:03.513 --> 22:05.379
You work for a real saint.

22:05.382 --> 22:07.949
I work for a politician who
wants to do good in the world.

22:09.119 --> 22:10.619
Give us the room.

22:13.045 --> 22:15.436
That kid knows the Constitution
backwards and forwards.

22:15.438 --> 22:18.205
He can name every
president, every capital,

22:18.207 --> 22:19.473
every Civil War battle.

22:19.475 --> 22:21.442
He loves this country
more than you and I do.

22:21.444 --> 22:24.879
How do you figure?

22:24.881 --> 22:26.714
Convert's fervor.

22:26.716 --> 22:29.114
Good to see you, sir.

22:29.117 --> 22:30.520
"Sir" denotes respect.

22:30.522 --> 22:33.823
You can call me "Mr. Speaker."

22:33.825 --> 22:35.658
The President doesn't know I'm here.

22:35.660 --> 22:36.826
Well, this is Washington.

22:36.828 --> 22:38.227
Everybody knows you're here.

22:38.229 --> 22:40.216
They just don't know on whose behalf.

22:40.219 --> 22:42.064
I'd like to say the American people,

22:42.066 --> 22:44.500
but I hear how that sounds.

22:44.502 --> 22:48.238
Well, you don't represent
the people any more than I do.

22:48.241 --> 22:50.241
We're in the minority
everywhere but in here.

22:50.243 --> 22:52.176
Maybe you disagree,
but I think we can get

22:52.178 --> 22:53.611
more done working together.

22:53.613 --> 22:56.742
And what would we be
working together for? Hmm?

22:56.745 --> 22:58.762
You and your mother look at this country

22:58.764 --> 23:01.632
the way politicians have
looked at it for 250 years,

23:01.634 --> 23:04.601
as if there's this
ideal America out there

23:04.603 --> 23:06.203
and it's just out of reach.

23:06.206 --> 23:07.884
This country, although
we've made strides,

23:07.886 --> 23:10.330
is arguably in the same place
it was all those years ago.

23:10.332 --> 23:14.334
We have the same issues, we
just use different names now.

23:14.336 --> 23:17.437
Once we called it slavery, now
we call it mass incarceration.

23:17.440 --> 23:20.119
We used to worry about robber barons,

23:20.121 --> 23:21.754
now we worry about the one percent.

23:21.756 --> 23:22.988
When all is said and done, none of us

23:22.990 --> 23:25.001
have done much of anything
except haggle over the check

23:25.004 --> 23:26.804
that John Adams left us with.

23:26.807 --> 23:28.173
But you're a Republican.

23:28.175 --> 23:31.409
This is the 21st Century, Mr. Haas.

23:31.411 --> 23:33.211
None of us is only one thing.

23:33.213 --> 23:36.282
So, you don't believe in
a two-party system anymore?

23:36.285 --> 23:38.952
Well, both sides think they know
what's best for this country,

23:38.954 --> 23:40.287
but we never agree.

23:40.289 --> 23:42.122
And the citizens see
us fighting each other,

23:42.124 --> 23:44.224
so why they should believe
we know what we're doing?

23:44.226 --> 23:46.838
Our definition of democracy

23:46.841 --> 23:49.728
is a first draft written centuries ago.

23:49.731 --> 23:52.078
But we can finally do better
once we stop pretending

23:52.080 --> 23:53.846
that people act in
their own best interests

23:53.848 --> 23:54.980
and get them to see that they

23:54.982 --> 23:57.049
should leave those decisions to us.

23:57.051 --> 24:00.297
So then, you believe in an oligarchy.

24:00.300 --> 24:04.035
I only believe that we should
let our elected leaders lead.

24:04.037 --> 24:05.470
Well, then, let my mother lead.

24:05.472 --> 24:08.564
I would, if she'd been elected.

24:09.989 --> 24:14.158
You want to bridge the
gap between the sides?

24:14.160 --> 24:17.406
So do I, by eliminating them.

24:17.409 --> 24:19.309
You take a step towards me, publicly.

24:19.311 --> 24:21.443
Come for work for me, and
we'll be that much closer.

24:21.445 --> 24:26.215
No parties, no fights, just one voice...

24:26.217 --> 24:27.950
The voice of the people.

24:37.774 --> 24:39.207
Yeah, I'm on my way back.

24:39.209 --> 24:40.475
None of the Collaborators
have a direct connection

24:40.477 --> 24:41.743
to what's going on in Cleveland.

24:41.745 --> 24:43.411
Not Sherman or Roarke
or Christian Kelly or...

24:43.413 --> 24:45.113
Owen, I have to call you right back.

24:55.694 --> 24:57.460
Geez.

25:05.817 --> 25:08.150
The Collaborators got
to the judge. I know it.

25:08.152 --> 25:09.485
I just don't know why.

25:09.487 --> 25:11.821
It's the jury that
decides the case, not him.

25:11.823 --> 25:14.390
Yeah, so when a judge forces
a verdict with an Allen Charge,

25:14.392 --> 25:16.826
it almost always favors the prosecution.

25:16.828 --> 25:19.361
By pressuring the jury,
the judge is able to sway

25:19.363 --> 25:21.608
any fence-sitters towards voting guilty.

25:21.611 --> 25:24.045
Exactly the verdict
the Collaborators want.

25:24.047 --> 25:25.584
So, you know what you need to do now.

25:25.587 --> 25:27.782
Get to that judge, ASAP.

25:27.784 --> 25:29.617
On it.

25:34.737 --> 25:38.339
What are you three doing up here?

25:38.341 --> 25:40.841
There's still phones ringing downstairs.

25:43.913 --> 25:46.614
You need to follow up on a
threat made to Judge Kaplan.

25:46.616 --> 25:49.851
Just like you followed up
on the threats to the jurors?

25:49.854 --> 25:51.687
I've got multiple
complaints of harassment.

25:51.689 --> 25:54.002
I'm not about to let you
tamper with that judge.

25:54.005 --> 25:55.725
I'm taking all three
of you into holding.

25:55.727 --> 25:57.360
You're done here.

27:00.892 --> 27:02.858
Ugh!

27:16.165 --> 27:18.032
Hey, Owen, you want to grab some din...

27:23.058 --> 27:25.313
- Miranda.
- No.

27:25.316 --> 27:26.524
This time, it's a yes.

27:26.527 --> 27:28.994
I'm sorry, but this is not about you.

27:28.997 --> 27:31.190
That judge in there... He's compromised.

27:31.191 --> 27:32.608
He's forcing a guilty verdict

27:32.609 --> 27:34.527
for the sake of a
much larger conspiracy.

27:34.528 --> 27:36.529
Of course there's a
conspiracy. You're here.

27:36.530 --> 27:39.198
We're breaking the law just
having this conversation.

27:39.199 --> 27:40.741
Miranda, I understand.

27:40.742 --> 27:42.576
You think if you follow
the letter of the law

27:42.577 --> 27:45.329
the rest of your life, it
might make up for what you did.

27:45.330 --> 27:46.747
But these people are criminals.

27:46.748 --> 27:48.281
This is a criminal act.

27:51.148 --> 27:53.878
So, you want to interrogate this judge?

27:54.423 --> 27:58.304
You found all the evidence you
need to connect him to this...

27:58.307 --> 28:00.617
this thing that you
can't even tell me about?

28:00.620 --> 28:03.014
Okay, we don't have the
time right now, all right?

28:05.267 --> 28:07.734
Miranda, if you don't bend the rules,

28:07.737 --> 28:10.262
you'll stand in the way of
a man getting a fair trial.

28:10.265 --> 28:12.664
You would obstruct justice again.

28:15.610 --> 28:19.433
You recently received a lump-sum
payment from a blind trust.

28:19.436 --> 28:20.907
You're accusing me of something?

28:20.910 --> 28:23.602
A bribe to force a verdict?

28:23.605 --> 28:25.405
That money has a clean paper trail,

28:25.407 --> 28:27.407
and I'm not forcing
anything other than an end

28:27.409 --> 28:28.875
to a long deliberation.

28:28.877 --> 28:31.010
An Allen Charge is a standard procedure.

28:31.012 --> 28:33.246
An Allen Charge is a
way to force the jury

28:33.248 --> 28:35.156
to decide quickly.

28:35.159 --> 28:37.093
You're being controlled, Judge.

28:37.095 --> 28:38.327
I've seen that look.

28:38.329 --> 28:41.397
You've taken the leap,
and now you're just hoping

28:41.399 --> 28:44.600
that you get away with your decision.

28:44.602 --> 28:46.255
We could keep digging.

28:48.999 --> 28:51.500
They told me that if I didn't ensure

28:51.502 --> 28:53.902
that he was found guilty,
they'd bring me up on charges.

28:53.904 --> 28:55.093
For what, I don't even know.

28:55.096 --> 28:56.338
We won't let that happen.

28:56.340 --> 28:58.970
Call a mistrial. I can't do that.

28:58.973 --> 29:00.973
The defendant will get a new trial,

29:00.975 --> 29:02.341
a chance for real justice.

29:06.781 --> 29:08.013
What is it?

29:08.015 --> 29:09.348
You're too late.

29:09.350 --> 29:11.250
The jury's reached a verdict.

29:18.491 --> 29:21.754
- Who are you working for?
- Who are you working for?

29:21.757 --> 29:22.923
Okay, just call security.

29:22.926 --> 29:24.620
Just tell 'em we found
a former operative

29:24.623 --> 29:25.589
breaking into The Farm.

29:25.592 --> 29:27.258
Call Matthew Keyes.

29:27.260 --> 29:29.227
Ask him what to do
with a current operative

29:29.229 --> 29:30.462
who knows about a secret task force

29:30.464 --> 29:31.930
being run out of The Farm.

29:31.932 --> 29:34.032
That's a pretty bold
accusation, Sebastian.

29:34.034 --> 29:35.796
You're hunting for a cabal

29:35.799 --> 29:38.033
hell-bent on bringing
the world to its knees,

29:38.035 --> 29:40.369
the same people who turned
Carly against her country,

29:40.371 --> 29:42.771
turned me against her,

29:42.773 --> 29:44.573
who broke everything good in me?

29:44.575 --> 29:46.308
You don't know who you're up against.

29:46.310 --> 29:48.477
Harry understood... That's why he ran.

29:48.479 --> 29:49.845
You saw Harry?

29:51.178 --> 29:53.545
Now go, as far away as you can.

29:53.547 --> 29:55.014
For how long?

29:55.016 --> 29:56.749
As long as it takes.

29:59.620 --> 30:01.020
Keep safe.

30:01.022 --> 30:04.156
You keep yourself safe, too, Sebastian.

30:06.623 --> 30:08.690
I was following Thomas Roth.

30:08.692 --> 30:10.325
I was there, at Bethesda Fountain.

30:10.327 --> 30:11.926
That's how I found out about you.

30:11.928 --> 30:13.489
Did you kill Roth?

30:13.492 --> 30:14.658
Did you kill Rebecca Sherman?

30:14.661 --> 30:16.137
I didn't kill anyone.

30:16.140 --> 30:18.063
But I think that you
and I have been doing

30:18.065 --> 30:20.398
the same thing... Trying to find out

30:20.400 --> 30:23.101
who Carly was working
for before she died.

30:27.032 --> 30:28.845
All right, so that's why you broke in,

30:28.848 --> 30:31.003
to see if we're on the same side?

30:31.005 --> 30:33.105
I had to be sure
before I approached you,

30:33.107 --> 30:34.573
so I started following you.

30:34.575 --> 30:36.575
But I needed real proof.

30:36.577 --> 30:40.946
After reading your e-mails, now I know.

30:40.948 --> 30:46.385
Rebecca Sherman, Alice
Winter, Thomas Roth,

30:46.387 --> 30:49.321
Peter Theo, Maxwell Fletcher,

30:49.323 --> 30:51.524
and Warren Shepherd.

30:58.826 --> 31:03.695
Peter... Theo.

31:04.698 --> 31:07.833
I gave you something valuable.

31:08.936 --> 31:10.969
Now give me something.

31:10.971 --> 31:12.470
Let me go.

31:12.472 --> 31:14.806
If I find anything
helpful, I'll pass it along.

31:14.808 --> 31:16.775
But you gotta share back.

31:21.976 --> 31:26.612
Henry Roarke and Christian Kelly.

31:26.614 --> 31:29.215
Thank you for getting on
the phone with me, Mr. Theo.

31:29.217 --> 31:31.050
I'm just fact-checking
the Journal's piece

31:31.052 --> 31:32.485
on your latest endowments.

31:32.487 --> 31:34.237
It's what I'm proudest of...

31:34.240 --> 31:35.918
The ability to bring help to others.

31:35.920 --> 31:40.223
Hmm, generous check to the
CareNet at Henry Roarke's gala.

31:40.225 --> 31:42.125
Yes.

31:42.127 --> 31:45.824
A million dollars to
the Thinkers Institute...

31:45.827 --> 31:47.127
Why that one?

31:47.129 --> 31:49.763
I met a young man on the
board, an entrepreneur.

31:49.765 --> 31:51.431
Reminded me of myself.

31:51.433 --> 31:53.500
I think you'll hear
ia lot about him soon.

31:53.502 --> 31:54.801
Huh.

31:54.803 --> 31:57.270
And I've noticed that Rebecca Sherman

31:57.272 --> 32:00.006
and Thomas Roth were both
at your daughter's wedding.

32:00.008 --> 32:02.642
I thought you were asking
about my charitable giving.

32:02.644 --> 32:03.810
I don't respond

32:03.812 --> 32:05.712
to fishing expeditions
from arts reporters.

32:05.714 --> 32:09.616
If you have any real questions,
you can find me anytime,

32:09.618 --> 32:11.151
unless I see you first.

32:19.088 --> 32:20.791
- Anything?
- What is it?

32:20.793 --> 32:22.926
Guilty, on all counts.

32:22.928 --> 32:23.860
What do we do now?

32:23.862 --> 32:26.330
We gear up.

32:26.332 --> 32:27.931
There's about to be a riot.

32:31.715 --> 32:33.782
And now, this city falls apart.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.644
We have to get out there

32:35.647 --> 32:37.412
and stop them from hurting each other.

32:37.413 --> 32:39.164
It doesn't make sense.

32:39.167 --> 32:40.833
The jury could've gone the other way.

32:40.834 --> 32:43.545
Even with pressure, they
could've done the right thing.

32:43.548 --> 32:45.844
Great. You haven't left yet.

32:45.847 --> 32:47.714
We need additional security.

32:47.717 --> 32:50.451
Henry Roarke just
landed at Tom Ridge Field

32:50.454 --> 32:51.553
about a half an hour ago.

32:51.556 --> 32:53.012
It's like he knew this was gonna happen.

32:53.015 --> 32:55.389
He wants to speak on the
courthouse steps in 15 minutes.

32:55.390 --> 32:58.257
He thinks he can bring
peace to the chaos.

32:58.260 --> 32:59.544
Oh, my God.

32:59.547 --> 33:01.395
They weren't just inciting the riot.

33:01.398 --> 33:03.019
The Collaborators were
trying to give themselves

33:03.022 --> 33:04.695
an opportunity to save the day.

33:04.698 --> 33:06.608
Roarke doesn't just want to
get the job by succession.

33:06.609 --> 33:08.742
He wants the will of the people.

33:11.137 --> 33:12.337
Clay, it's Shelby.

33:12.340 --> 33:14.140
Roarke's here in Cleveland.

33:14.143 --> 33:15.367
This is all a long play.

33:15.368 --> 33:17.627
To undermine Claire as the only person

33:17.630 --> 33:20.914
who can maintain law and order
in a time of chaos she created.

33:20.915 --> 33:22.513
You know about this?

33:22.516 --> 33:25.240
You really think I was only
hired 'cause I knew the boss?

33:25.243 --> 33:27.513
Hang tight. I got this.

33:33.710 --> 33:36.378
Well, it's not every day you get

33:36.380 --> 33:38.680
a bona fide American
hero as a bodyguard.

33:38.682 --> 33:40.749
Just happy to serve, sir.

33:40.751 --> 33:42.217
Well, let's go out
there and stop this thing

33:42.219 --> 33:43.752
like the heroes we are.

33:53.121 --> 33:55.555
- Madam President.
- Mr. Speaker.

33:55.557 --> 33:56.956
You don't mind if I introduce you?

33:56.958 --> 33:58.958
Um, I'd be honored.

34:06.468 --> 34:09.235
Thank you. Thank you.

34:09.237 --> 34:11.603
Thank you.

34:11.607 --> 34:14.998
Presidents usually start these speeches

34:15.001 --> 34:18.469
with "My fellow Americans,"
because we like to remind you

34:18.471 --> 34:22.607
that we are all in
this together, equals.

34:22.609 --> 34:24.641
We also say, "My fellow Americans,"

34:24.643 --> 34:26.010
so that you'll forget for a second

34:26.012 --> 34:28.858
everything in our
country that divides us.

34:28.860 --> 34:30.960
We tell you that we
believe in a United States

34:30.963 --> 34:33.362
that will protect your family,

34:33.364 --> 34:36.533
and then we throw a man
in jail for protecting his.

34:39.417 --> 34:41.984
I am responsible for that.

34:41.985 --> 34:44.085
I helped pass the executive order

34:44.088 --> 34:46.389
that made Benjamin Johnson's
gun purchase illegal

34:46.391 --> 34:49.770
because I believed that it
would save people's lives,

34:49.773 --> 34:51.873
and maybe it did.

34:51.875 --> 34:54.810
But it also ruined a man's life.

34:54.812 --> 34:58.146
We live in a country of
more than two parties.

34:58.148 --> 35:00.048
Beware of any leader who tells you

35:00.050 --> 35:02.551
it would be easier for
you to just let them

35:02.553 --> 35:07.556
make your decisions for you
because they know what is best,

35:07.558 --> 35:12.105
because we do not know what's best.

35:12.108 --> 35:15.342
We learn what's best
through trial and error.

35:15.344 --> 35:18.579
I pushed for that law because I believed

35:18.581 --> 35:22.383
it was right at the time.

35:22.385 --> 35:25.619
But I made a mistake.

35:25.621 --> 35:27.922
It wasn't ready,

35:27.924 --> 35:31.326
and it wasn't properly vetted.

35:31.329 --> 35:33.529
I will not make that mistake again.

35:39.639 --> 35:42.440
Roll call... Christian
Kelly, Henry Roarke,

35:42.442 --> 35:44.209
Rebecca Sherman, and Thomas Roth.

35:44.211 --> 35:47.123
And now, thanks to a
tip from an old friend,

35:47.126 --> 35:50.127
Alice Winter of Greypool,
our defense collaborator,

35:50.129 --> 35:54.131
tech mogul Peter Theo,
Maxwell Fletcher the ideologue,

35:54.133 --> 35:59.047
and finally, media
baron Warren Shepherd.

35:59.050 --> 36:01.484
So, if our analysis is
right and we're looking

36:01.486 --> 36:06.122
for eight Collaborators,
we have everyone.

36:06.124 --> 36:09.559
It feels nice to have
a win for a change.

36:09.561 --> 36:12.829
Two, when you count your
coup on the courthouse steps.

36:12.831 --> 36:15.676
We cut Roarke off at the knees.

36:15.679 --> 36:17.579
None of us knows how this will end,

36:17.581 --> 36:18.880
but when I can't sleep at night,

36:18.882 --> 36:21.817
I remember that you're
here fighting back.

36:21.819 --> 36:25.954
And that you stay here,
despite the setbacks,

36:25.956 --> 36:30.325
threats on your lives, loss of friends.

36:30.327 --> 36:34.299
You keep going, and I
thank all of you for that.

36:34.302 --> 36:36.064
I hope the next time we gather here,

36:36.066 --> 36:38.407
this war will be over.

36:38.410 --> 36:40.002
I take no credit for that speech.

36:40.004 --> 36:42.004
That's all her.

36:42.006 --> 36:44.139
But the other one...

36:49.764 --> 36:51.497
You're home!

36:51.500 --> 36:54.601
I mean, here. You live somewhere else.

36:54.603 --> 36:56.281
I do.

36:56.284 --> 36:57.783
Yeah, I, um... I saw the light on.

36:57.785 --> 37:01.353
I just wasn't sure
if it was Owen or you.

37:01.355 --> 37:03.055
You cook?

37:04.794 --> 37:07.728
- So, I'm home...
- Right, um,

37:07.730 --> 37:11.432
I just came to say I'm glad you're here.

37:11.434 --> 37:12.733
I was worried about you.

37:12.735 --> 37:14.535
I thought maybe you would...

37:14.537 --> 37:16.234
Run away?

37:16.237 --> 37:18.975
I thought you were going to
see your mother to shut us down.

37:18.977 --> 37:20.943
I was.

37:20.945 --> 37:23.946
What happened?

37:23.948 --> 37:28.719
I let my fear of failure
take me to a dark place...

37:28.722 --> 37:31.189
A place I needed to go to remind me

37:31.191 --> 37:32.657
it's never where I ever want to be.

37:32.659 --> 37:34.025
Clay, you have a gift.

37:34.027 --> 37:36.094
You know how to inspire people,

37:36.096 --> 37:39.364
how to keep us moving forward
even when we don't want to.

37:39.366 --> 37:42.767
That speech tonight...
We know you wrote it.

37:42.769 --> 37:45.537
But more than that, we
know that you mean it.

37:45.539 --> 37:47.739
Thank you for not leaving us.

37:47.741 --> 37:49.174
We need you.

37:50.813 --> 37:54.381
Nice monologue, Michelle Williams.

37:54.383 --> 37:56.883
Are we eating this century?

37:59.658 --> 38:00.822
Are you staying for supper?

38:00.824 --> 38:02.257
No, actually, I think I should go.

38:02.259 --> 38:05.827
Good idea. I'll walk you out.

38:05.830 --> 38:07.830
So, I can call you to check in on Clay,

38:07.833 --> 38:09.900
but you won't text me to
say you got the message?

38:09.902 --> 38:11.135
I'm here, aren't I?

38:11.137 --> 38:13.182
Unfortunately, so are you.

38:13.185 --> 38:15.351
Look, you were right.

38:15.353 --> 38:17.754
Clay's struggling, but not with work.

38:17.756 --> 38:19.489
Only you.

38:21.026 --> 38:25.628
Whatever it is that's
happening between you two,

38:25.630 --> 38:28.565
you have to stop it or, I swear,

38:28.567 --> 38:32.547
I will make your life a living hell.

38:32.550 --> 38:33.882
Hey, get some rest.

38:33.884 --> 38:36.151
You look about 10 years
older than you should.

38:39.399 --> 38:40.801
I ordered you a burger.

38:40.804 --> 38:43.271
And I booked you some
time at the shooting range.

38:43.273 --> 38:45.940
Hmm. You really don't
take no for an answer, huh?

38:45.942 --> 38:47.509
I really don't.

38:47.512 --> 38:48.923
It looks like my work's paid off.

38:48.926 --> 38:50.747
I don't see any bruises.

38:50.749 --> 38:53.316
Yeah, Ryan told me about
our friend, Sebastian.

38:53.318 --> 38:54.484
Oh, yeah, hey!

38:54.486 --> 38:55.719
I did all right.

38:55.721 --> 38:58.288
I'd say some instincts came
back when I needed them.

38:58.290 --> 38:59.622
Good!

39:01.093 --> 39:03.893
You know what's odd?

39:03.895 --> 39:05.829
I trust you.

39:05.831 --> 39:07.565
Wait!

39:07.568 --> 39:09.401
Why... Why is that odd?

39:09.403 --> 39:11.448
Because I don't trust anyone.

39:11.451 --> 39:13.250
It's the worst part about myself.

39:13.252 --> 39:15.853
I just assume everyone's lying to me,

39:15.855 --> 39:17.488
and they usually are.

39:17.490 --> 39:20.224
Ryan... We all know how that started.

39:20.226 --> 39:23.027
Harry, Nimah, even Shelby...

39:23.029 --> 39:25.229
At some time or another,
they've lied to me.

39:25.231 --> 39:27.631
But you don't.

39:27.633 --> 39:29.468
You never have.

39:29.471 --> 39:31.571
Yeah, that's a lot to put on me.

39:31.573 --> 39:33.506
Some day, I may have to.

39:33.508 --> 39:34.941
I know, but you haven't yet.

39:34.943 --> 39:36.075
I'm gonna start tomorrow.

39:36.077 --> 39:39.779
Shut up.

39:39.781 --> 39:42.315
Alex Parrish,

39:42.317 --> 39:45.318
if we're being honest with each other,

39:45.320 --> 39:49.555
I never really liked you... At all.

39:49.557 --> 39:51.390
Hmm.

39:51.392 --> 39:53.626
Next time, pick a better lie.

39:53.628 --> 39:55.595
Everyone likes me.

39:57.995 --> 39:59.557
I'll give you that.

40:02.729 --> 40:03.961
Raina.

40:03.963 --> 40:06.764
Hi, it's good to see you.

40:06.766 --> 40:08.432
I'm hungry.

40:08.434 --> 40:10.835
I'll make the salad if
you make the entrée.

40:10.837 --> 40:12.903
You got it.

40:17.858 --> 40:19.825
Heading out, unless you need something?

40:21.862 --> 40:28.333
You once asked me why I
still use this Rolodex.

40:28.335 --> 40:31.837
I like to see the sheer tonnage
of people that owe me favors.

40:31.839 --> 40:34.684
I don't remember the last
time that I was Henry.

40:34.687 --> 40:35.714
I'm Mr. Speaker,

40:35.717 --> 40:37.788
and people come into this
office to get something.

40:37.790 --> 40:39.857
Doesn't matter if
they're a rival or an ally

40:39.859 --> 40:43.461
or an old friend from boarding school.

40:43.463 --> 40:46.698
I didn't know Clay would do that.

40:46.701 --> 40:49.836
Well, if you didn't, you should have.

40:49.838 --> 40:51.571
And if you want to keep your job,

40:51.573 --> 40:54.507
you'll find out what he's up
to and you'll make it up to me.

40:54.509 --> 40:56.342
And if you don't,

40:56.344 --> 40:59.913
I'll have your green card
revoked and deport you.

40:59.915 --> 41:02.382
I bet you didn't know
I would do that, either.

41:11.496 --> 41:13.095
Oh, you're smarter than you look.

41:13.098 --> 41:15.232
- This has to stop.
- Can it wait half an hour?

41:15.234 --> 41:17.012
I have to run down a lead.

41:17.015 --> 41:19.282
A lead? On me and my team?

41:19.284 --> 41:20.950
I know you think I'm an adversary,

41:20.952 --> 41:22.451
but I'm on your side.

41:22.453 --> 41:24.355
I think I found something
that could help you.

41:24.358 --> 41:25.421
I swear!

41:25.423 --> 41:26.689
You want me to trust you now?

41:26.691 --> 41:28.424
Like I could trust you before?

41:28.426 --> 41:31.127
Are we past that?

41:31.129 --> 41:32.929
You tell me.

41:40.496 --> 41:43.064
I'm past it, and that felt
like you're past it, too.

41:43.066 --> 41:44.698
But if not, we can make up

41:44.700 --> 41:46.267
when I get back as much as you want.

41:46.269 --> 41:47.935
We can even fight somewhere first.

41:47.937 --> 41:49.770
Or, I could go with you, and that way

41:49.772 --> 41:51.645
we can get to the make-out part faster.

41:51.648 --> 41:53.486
Half an hour, back here.

41:53.488 --> 41:54.587
Be ready to rumble.

41:54.589 --> 41:56.489
Oh, and bring wine.
