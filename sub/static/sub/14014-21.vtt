Alison, over here.

(Alison)
You still want to
talk to me after that?

00:59.025 --> 01:00.014
What happened
out there?

01:00.093 --> 01:02.994
Korey's drop shot looked
too much for you.
Hey, that was just practice.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.462
I'm sandbagging her
for next week.

01:04.531 --> 01:05.862
You actually think
you've a chance...

01:05.932 --> 01:08.162
to beat Korey?
Why don't you ask her?

01:08.234 --> 01:09.963
What are you going to do
this week to prepare?

01:10.036 --> 01:12.368
First thing,
I'm going to take a shower.

01:12.439 --> 01:14.304
(reporter)
How'd you like practice,
Korey?

01:14.374 --> 01:15.773
I wasrt too happy
with my game.

01:15.842 --> 01:17.434
Alison beat me
on too many serves.

01:17.510 --> 01:18.909
Are you ready
for the Slims next week?

01:18.978 --> 01:20.775
If you guys
let me rest up.

01:20.847 --> 01:23.941
Korey,
what about the national team?
Talk to my dad.

01:24.184 --> 01:25.549
How about it, Mitch?

01:25.952 --> 01:28.113
Well, I think it's too soon
to tell about the Olympics.

01:28.188 --> 01:31.555
Let's just see how
Korey does in the Grand Slam,
okay, guys?

[Reporters chattering]

01:44.337 --> 01:46.362
Hi. Did you sign
that contract?

01:46.439 --> 01:48.100
I'm sure Danswood signed it,
there was...

01:56.516 --> 02:00.282
My hand.
Somebody get a doctor, please.

02:00.420 --> 02:03.218
Oh, God, it hurts.
It was some guy.

02:05.191 --> 02:07.125
The nose was bloodied
but not broken.

02:07.193 --> 02:08.751
Most certainly
from a fist.

02:08.828 --> 02:10.887
Then there's the fractured
right carpal bone.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.489
And that would be where?
The wrist.

02:13.566 --> 02:15.193
She has
a broken wrist.

02:15.301 --> 02:18.634
There's a distinct bruise
half an inch wide.
Probably a stick.

02:18.705 --> 02:20.297
Okay, when can we
talk to her?

02:20.373 --> 02:22.637
I'd give it a couple of hours.
She was pretty hysterical.

02:22.709 --> 02:24.540
I gave her something
to help her sleep.

02:24.611 --> 02:26.408
I better bring some home
for me tonight, too.

02:26.479 --> 02:28.344
Excuse me?
My daughter.

02:28.515 --> 02:30.483
All year she bothers me,
"Get tickets for the Garden.

02:30.550 --> 02:32.916
"Get tickets for the Garden.
I have to see Korey."

02:32.986 --> 02:35.147
I get two seats courtside,
now this.

<i>[Woman chattering</i>

02:36.723 --> 02:38.714

That narrows it down.

02:38.791 --> 02:39.849
Any idea who did it?

02:39.926 --> 02:42.019
Will she play next week?
No comment.

02:42.095 --> 02:43.858
(Logan)
Here comes the clown squad.

02:43.930 --> 02:46.228
Van Buren thought you guys
needed adult supervision.

02:46.299 --> 02:47.596
The more the merrier.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.601
What are we telling
the press hogs?
Nada.

02:49.669 --> 02:52.137
Nothing.
What, are you guys
afraid of the limelight?

02:52.205 --> 02:53.763
Knock your brains out,
O'Hearn.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.934
After you get done
giving out autographs,
we'll be at the crime scene.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.570
Yeah. Bring your own donuts.

03:48.361 --> 03:51.387
I wanted to keep
the practices closed,
but, hey, I'm just the coach.

03:51.464 --> 03:53.989
They didn't want to hear
about bodyguards.

03:54.100 --> 03:56.967
Korey didn't like
the idea of a chaperone?
Right.

03:57.036 --> 03:59.436
Then there's
the image problem.
The fans resent it.

03:59.505 --> 04:01.473
The press says
you're inaccessible.

04:01.541 --> 04:05.341
That's not what
the sponsors want to hear
about America's sweetheart.

04:05.645 --> 04:08.273
After Monica Seles,
you'd figure
they'd get the message.

04:08.348 --> 04:10.475
There's a million kooks
out there.

04:11.384 --> 04:13.875
That's not counting
the other four boroughs.

04:13.953 --> 04:17.320
I need to get this stuff
back to Korey.
I'll be around if you need me.

04:17.390 --> 04:19.380
(Briscoe)
We're talking about
more than two hours.

04:19.459 --> 04:22.553
Could anybody have come
from someplace else?
Maybe from downstairs?

04:22.629 --> 04:24.756
The other side of the gym?
(guard)
I was here the whole time.

04:24.831 --> 04:26.765
Nobody got past me
except players and coaches.

04:26.833 --> 04:29.165
What about that door there?
Where's that go to?

04:29.235 --> 04:31.829
A parking lot.
Strictly a fire exit.

04:32.238 --> 04:33.762
It's locked on the inside
at all times.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.501
He couldn't have
got in through there.

04:35.575 --> 04:37.475
Yeah,
but he could have
gotten out this way.

04:37.543 --> 04:39.170
We'll send somebody
to dust for prints.

04:39.245 --> 04:41.406
Okay, you said
there was another girl
in the locker room?

04:41.481 --> 04:43.642
Yeah, another player.
We told her to wait
to talk to you.

04:43.716 --> 04:45.581
She's in the pro shop.

04:46.519 --> 04:48.043
Nothing there.

04:48.321 --> 04:52.052
Hey, O'Hearn,
don't save it
for the press conference.

04:52.258 --> 04:54.089
Mr. Santos
works the parking lot.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.684
At the approximate time
of the assault...

04:55.762 --> 04:58.731
he saw a white guy
in a black leather jacket
come through the fire door.

04:58.798 --> 04:59.992
Would he recognize him?

05:00.066 --> 05:03.035
He was 30 yards away.
This guy's a waste of time.

05:03.703 --> 05:06.194
I heard a scream.
I came running out.

05:06.339 --> 05:08.637
The guy almost knocked me down
heading for the door.

05:08.708 --> 05:11.871
Did you get a look at him?
I was really looking at Korey.

05:11.944 --> 05:14.276
I don't know.
He had dark hair.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.711
Leather jacket?
Maybe. It was kind of a blur.

05:18.051 --> 05:21.350
Did the blur say anything?
Like, "Excuse me"? No.

05:21.821 --> 05:25.348
I didn't even know
what was happening
till I saw Korey on the floor.

05:25.425 --> 05:27.086
The tournament
starts Monday.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.787
Is she going
to be able to play?

05:28.861 --> 05:30.761
Not unless
she's a switch-hitter.

05:30.830 --> 05:33.765
Guy broke her wrist.
Poor Korey.

05:34.300 --> 05:36.427
I know how much
she wanted to win.

05:40.606 --> 05:42.403
I was walking towards
the locker room...

05:42.475 --> 05:44.670
and somebody came at me
from behind.

05:44.977 --> 05:47.844
He pushed me down,
and I felt this pain
in my hand.

05:48.881 --> 05:52.078
I almost blanked out.
Did you get a look at him?

05:53.019 --> 05:55.852
He was a white guy,
dark hair.

05:57.223 --> 05:58.884
He was really big.

06:00.126 --> 06:01.684
I'm sorry,
it was just too fast.

06:01.761 --> 06:04.252
I mean, he was all over me.
I couldn't defend myself.

06:04.330 --> 06:06.855
Do you have any idea
why somebody would want
to do this to you?

06:06.933 --> 06:08.400
Ex-boyfriend?

06:11.204 --> 06:14.196
Well,
it was just a matter of time,
if you ask me.

06:14.774 --> 06:15.763
Here.

06:17.577 --> 06:21.308
From the lunatic fringe.
I should've known.

06:25.852 --> 06:27.444
(Briscoe)
"Korey, since you choose...

06:27.520 --> 06:29.317
"to ignore me,
I have to resort to this...

06:29.389 --> 06:31.380
"crude method
of communication.

"You know I was in Bridgeport.
You looked right at me."

last February.

everything...

06:38.164 --> 06:41.531
"time, energy,
respectful love.
Now you shut me out.

06:41.667 --> 06:45.467
"If you won't play for me,
I hope you never play again.
Alan."

06:46.305 --> 06:48.034
(Briscoe)
Well, surprise, surprise.

06:48.107 --> 06:50.337
No return address.
New York postmark.

06:52.178 --> 06:53.202
[Sighs]

06:53.279 --> 06:55.076
Did you have a relationship
with this guy, at all?

06:55.148 --> 06:57.378
No. It was
all in his head.

06:57.617 --> 07:00.211
I mean,
if I happen to look up
into the stands in between...

07:00.286 --> 07:03.346
serves or something,
it's not at anybody
in particular.

07:04.524 --> 07:06.424
(Mitch)
There was a phone call.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.660
Somebody paged me
at the gym.

07:10.129 --> 07:12.256
This creep said I could
get hurt if I kept playing.

07:12.331 --> 07:14.390
Did he identify himself?
No.

07:14.834 --> 07:17.997
I just hung up.
Why didn't you
call the police?

07:18.571 --> 07:21.768
I was scared.
Well, what about you?

07:24.377 --> 07:27.005
I just found out
about this yesterday.

07:28.981 --> 07:31.381
You're going to catch him,
right?

07:31.951 --> 07:33.885
I think Alan
would be his true name.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.945
These people don't make any
effort to hide their identity.

07:37.023 --> 07:39.491
He made an effort not to
include a return address.

07:39.559 --> 07:42.119
He probably assumes
Korey Burke already knows it.

07:42.195 --> 07:43.787
He assumes
they have a relationship.

07:43.863 --> 07:45.990
He certainly believes
he's earned one.

07:46.065 --> 07:47.896
Well, he drives to Connecticut
for a game.

07:47.967 --> 07:49.434
I guess that's
won'th something.

07:49.502 --> 07:50.594
(Olivet)
I think he's invested...

07:50.670 --> 07:53.503
considerably more than
gas money on this fixation.

07:53.573 --> 07:56.940
Every game,
every news article <i>...</i>
It's a full-time occupation.

07:57.009 --> 07:59.739
What the hell's in it for him?
Korey barely knows he exists.

07:59.812 --> 08:02.906
The way he sees it,
she changes her running shoes,
that's her way of...

08:02.982 --> 08:05.610
saying hello to him.
She waves to the crowd...

08:05.818 --> 08:07.547
it's a declaration of love.

08:07.620 --> 08:09.383
And if the secret code
gets jumbled...

08:09.455 --> 08:11.320
any chance
he'd become violent?

08:11.924 --> 08:14.154
There's a low risk.
About 5%.

08:14.227 --> 08:17.321
"You don't play for me,
I hope you never play
for anybody else"?

08:17.396 --> 08:18.693
I'd be watching my back.

08:18.764 --> 08:22.131
Well, you take it as a threat.
He probably meant it as curse.

08:22.268 --> 08:25.260
Right. And he whacked her
with his magic wand.

08:26.839 --> 08:30.172
We're running a check
on a tournament you had,
March 20.

08:30.576 --> 08:34.636
Yeah, I just want to find out
if there was any kind of
an incident, any disturbance.

08:34.714 --> 08:36.705
Yeah, could you? Thanks.

08:37.917 --> 08:42.445
Well, Forensics lifted
five sets of prints
from the letter.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.389
Korey, her dad,
and three unknowns.

08:45.625 --> 08:48.355
They're still sorting through
the prints they got off
the fire exit.

08:48.427 --> 08:51.157
Yeah. Okay.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.160
Really?
Was he taken into custody?

08:56.135 --> 08:57.932
Okay. Thank you, very much.

08:58.371 --> 09:01.272
Alan Lovitz, West 72nd Street.

09:01.574 --> 09:04.099
Tried to force his way
into the players' locker room.

09:04.176 --> 09:06.474
Said he had a gift
for Korey Burke.

09:06.946 --> 09:08.641
[Banging on door]

09:11.017 --> 09:12.484
Alan Lovitz?
Yes.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.520
I'm Detective Logan,
this is Detective Briscoe.

09:14.587 --> 09:16.418
You mind if we come in?
Why? What's the problem?

09:16.489 --> 09:18.923
Can we talk inside?
You want to tell me
what this is about?

09:18.991 --> 09:22.825
Well, it might be about
your little hobby.
Korey Burke?

09:23.195 --> 09:25.220
The tennis player?
(Briscoe)
No, the hockey player.

09:25.298 --> 09:28.028
I think she means
a little bit more
to you than that.

09:28.100 --> 09:29.795
I admit I'm a fan.

09:29.969 --> 09:31.402
Hey, I'm a fan
of Patrick Ewing.

09:31.470 --> 09:33.267
I don't send him
threatening letters.

09:33.339 --> 09:36.570
I've never threatened Korey.
I'd never hurt her.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.444
I've followed her career
since she turned pro.
Come here.

09:40.513 --> 09:42.606
(Alan)
Look at this. Come here.

09:44.984 --> 09:47.043
Korey Burke.

09:48.120 --> 09:49.644
Boy, you got
everything in here...

09:49.722 --> 09:51.349
but a lock of hair
and her baby teeth.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.790
This look like somebody
who'd hurt her?

09:54.126 --> 09:57.721
You have any other job,
Mr. Lovitz,
besides the fan club?

09:58.064 --> 10:02.057
I sell PVC piping.
Direct. To contractors.

10:02.635 --> 10:04.398
And yesterday afternoon,
were you drumming up...

10:04.470 --> 10:06.700
business
at the Robinson Club?

10:08.140 --> 10:09.869
Korey's practice schedule.

10:11.677 --> 10:13.338
Okay,
pack up your sample case.

10:13.412 --> 10:15.607
You're going on a road trip,
Mr. Lovitz.

10:15.848 --> 10:17.076
Come on.

10:18.985 --> 10:21.681
So he writes one letter,
he keeps a few pictures.

10:21.754 --> 10:23.312
It's an innocent pastime.

10:23.389 --> 10:25.482
All Mark Chapman wanted
was an autograph.

10:25.558 --> 10:27.924
I never went
near Korey yesterday.

10:28.694 --> 10:29.854
I was working.

10:29.929 --> 10:33.330
(Briscoe)
You were supposed to be
peddling pipe up in Scarsdale.

10:33.833 --> 10:35.494
Contractor says
you never showed up.

10:35.568 --> 10:38.401
I got lost.
I had the wrong address.

10:39.739 --> 10:42.173
Look, I know it's hard
for you guys to understand.

10:42.241 --> 10:43.333
Try us.

10:43.609 --> 10:45.474
We can be very open-minded.

10:45.544 --> 10:46.875
Alan.
No.

10:47.546 --> 10:51.482
I want to explain.
I'm very devoted to Korey.

10:51.550 --> 10:53.950
I have made that clear
to her many times.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.782
She knows I only want
what's best for her.

10:56.856 --> 10:59.484
Well,
making threats over the phone
is a hell of a way to show...

10:59.558 --> 11:01.116
I never called her!

11:02.828 --> 11:04.955
If she said that,
she's lying.

11:05.264 --> 11:08.461
That must've been tough,
taking all that rejection.

11:08.534 --> 11:12.698
My client's had his head
shrunk by professionals.
Don't waste your time.

11:13.105 --> 11:15.266
This rap sessiors over.
Come on, Alan,
you're going home.

11:15.341 --> 11:18.333
No, sorry,
we got him booked for a little
show-and-tell with the victim.

11:18.411 --> 11:20.538
My client doesn't have
to submit to a lineup.

11:20.613 --> 11:21.602
No.

11:23.049 --> 11:24.744
I want her to see me.

11:25.484 --> 11:27.247
His call, Counselor.

11:30.656 --> 11:32.851
There's no hurry,
Miss Burke.

11:44.804 --> 11:49.673
No. I don't think
it's any of them.
(Kincaid)
All right. Thank you.

12:01.087 --> 12:04.784
Look at each one.
Tell us if you
recognize anybody.

12:14.800 --> 12:18.702
No. He's not there.
You're absolutely sure?

12:18.771 --> 12:21.865
Miss Kincaid,
maybe you'd like
to use a pointer.

12:23.442 --> 12:25.000
Okay. Thank you.

12:27.413 --> 12:28.573
(Logan)
Nice picture.

12:28.647 --> 12:30.137
(Briscoe)
Yeah, this should keep
the Mayor happy.

12:30.216 --> 12:33.379
And we look real smart,
putting Lovitz
back on the street.

12:33.452 --> 12:35.818
Oh, well, listen,
we could Krazy Glue his feet
to the floor...

12:35.888 --> 12:38.322
it still wouldn't hold him.
So Mr. Lovitz is free...

12:38.390 --> 12:41.052
to keep dogging Korey Burke
around the country.

12:41.127 --> 12:42.321
You check his LUDs?

12:42.394 --> 12:44.760
Yeah, calls to
tennis clubs...

12:44.830 --> 12:47.458
tennis magazines,
pro tour associations.

12:47.533 --> 12:49.398
Guy's got tennis balls
between his ears.

12:49.468 --> 12:51.299
No calls
to Korey Burke's gym?

12:51.370 --> 12:55.306
The guy's a road warrior.
He's got a million
phone booths to choose from.

12:55.374 --> 12:59.640
Mitchell Burke just called.
Your friend just left
another love letter.

13:00.813 --> 13:03.543
I'd just been to the gym
and cleaned out my bag.

13:06.152 --> 13:09.417
This was in the bottom.
Put that right there, okay?

13:10.556 --> 13:12.820
(Briscoe)
You didn't see anybody
near your locker?

13:12.892 --> 13:15.622
Well, there were other girls
in the room,
but I locked up my stuff.

13:15.694 --> 13:18.629
What about the bag?
Maybe you left it for a minute
by the front desk?

13:18.697 --> 13:20.597
No, I had it with me
the whole time.

13:20.666 --> 13:23.157
This is insane.
How long do we have to put up
with this maniac?

13:23.235 --> 13:25.066
I can't believe that he's back
out on the street.

13:25.137 --> 13:27.605
Without an ID,
there's not much
we can hold him on.

13:27.673 --> 13:29.504
(Logan)
We might have something now.

13:30.376 --> 13:32.844
"You got my warning.
No more games.

13:33.412 --> 13:36.939
"The next time you set foot
on a court, you die."

13:44.456 --> 13:46.583
Our favorite fruitcake,
Alan...

13:46.826 --> 13:48.259
was on an overnight in Jersey.

13:48.327 --> 13:49.760
This time his alibi
checks out.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.490
There's no way
he could have slipped back...

13:51.564 --> 13:53.589
and put the note
in Korey's bag.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.191
Well, maybe he had
a friend at the gym.

13:56.402 --> 13:59.394
According to Olivet the note
doesn't even fit his m.o.

13:59.471 --> 14:02.372
It was written
in block letters
with the wrong hand...

14:02.441 --> 14:03.931
and it was unsigned.

14:04.076 --> 14:05.737
Well, give him credit
for being smart.

14:05.811 --> 14:08.245
This boy would rather
be noticed. He wants...

14:08.314 --> 14:09.679
Korey to know his name.

14:09.748 --> 14:12.080
He wants her to see
his face in a lineup.

14:12.151 --> 14:14.312
All of a sudden
he craves anonymity?

14:15.921 --> 14:18.481
What are you saying?
Korey has another pen pal?

14:18.557 --> 14:21.117
Somebody who wants her
to hang up her racket.

14:25.331 --> 14:27.595
(Logan)
You really think
you should be eating that?

14:27.666 --> 14:29.930
A couple of hours
on the court,
I'll burn it right off.

14:30.002 --> 14:32.800
I'm still working
on a hot dog
from the Mets game.

14:33.606 --> 14:36.905
Yesterday,
before you went to the gym,
you go anywhere else?

14:37.309 --> 14:39.209
I went to the doctor's
to get some x-rays...

14:39.278 --> 14:42.543
and then I just stopped in
to see Jane.
(Briscoe)
Your coach?

14:42.748 --> 14:45.444
She had some new rackets
she wanted me to look at.

14:45.517 --> 14:48.145
And then we just did
foot drills for a while.

14:48.287 --> 14:51.518
I don't think
I could be getting through
this without her.

14:51.690 --> 14:53.487
I never believed
it was that guy Alan.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.151
Even after the letter
he wrote?

14:55.227 --> 14:57.991
I talked to some
of the other girls. I mean,
they all get letters.

14:58.063 --> 15:00.463
Guys come on to you,
they buy you things.

15:00.532 --> 15:02.227
My dad worries but...

15:02.401 --> 15:05.268
these guys are dweebs.
They're completely harmless.

15:05.371 --> 15:07.464
What about the competition?

15:08.674 --> 15:11.871
You kidding?
They're my friends.
That's ridiculous.

15:13.012 --> 15:14.411
Look,
I don't want you bothering...

15:14.480 --> 15:17.244
any of the other players.
This is my problem.

15:18.584 --> 15:21.747
I've got to go.
I've got
a doctor's appointment.

15:24.290 --> 15:27.817
Little junior diplomat.
Never speak ill
of your enemies.

15:28.827 --> 15:29.953
You buy it?

15:31.797 --> 15:33.788
Move your feet Jessie.
Come on.

15:34.066 --> 15:35.693
You're stuck in cement!

15:35.801 --> 15:38.326
Go-go-go-go!

15:38.604 --> 15:41.664
Eye on the ball.
Nice shot!

15:43.409 --> 15:45.070
(Briscoe)
Any of them
the next Korey Burke?

15:45.144 --> 15:46.611
Not one of them
half as tough.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.670
Korey played the Open
last year on a sprained ankle.

15:48.747 --> 15:51.409
These kids,
they break a nail,
they fall apart.

15:51.483 --> 15:54.577
They'd faint if they saw
what Korey goes through
just to stay Number 5.

15:54.653 --> 15:57.281
A lot of these players
gunning for her position?

15:57.356 --> 15:59.381
Number 6
through 200.

15:59.525 --> 16:02.688
Any of them likely to take
the competition off the court?

16:02.761 --> 16:04.251
And break her wrist?

16:04.396 --> 16:06.125
I thought it was
some nut.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.366
(Logan)
Maybe someone who would like
us to believe that.

16:09.435 --> 16:12.563
Maybe some other player she
talked to about her fan mail?

16:13.272 --> 16:15.604
Korey doesn't have
heart-to-hearts
with other players.

16:15.674 --> 16:17.437
Her father's idea.
He thinks fraternizing...

16:17.509 --> 16:20.239
with the competition
blunts her killer instinct.

16:20.512 --> 16:23.003
And all teenagers
listen to their old man.

16:23.349 --> 16:26.750
She used to be
close with Alison,
the girl she practices with.

16:27.019 --> 16:29.419
But Mitch keeps
a pretty tight leash on her.

16:29.488 --> 16:31.183
I don't know what it does
for her social life...

16:31.256 --> 16:33.884
but it sure as hell
helps her game.

16:33.959 --> 16:35.893
Well, thanks.

16:39.732 --> 16:41.632
(Mitch)
Everybody wants
a piece of Korey.

16:41.700 --> 16:44.863
I take care of the business.
Korey's job
is winning tournaments.

16:44.937 --> 16:46.427
Let's just go into my office.

16:46.505 --> 16:48.700
(Briscoe)
Well, what about
when she's not playing?

16:48.774 --> 16:51.174
[Sighing]
She's a teenager.
What can I tell you?

16:51.243 --> 16:54.406
Yeah, I've got two in college.
Well, then you know
what I'm talking about.

16:54.480 --> 16:55.640
Sorry to drag you
down here...

16:55.714 --> 16:57.045
but I gotta meet
with these lawyers...

16:57.116 --> 16:58.140
from a soft drink company.

16:58.217 --> 17:00.947
(Mitch)
They want to put their logo
on Korey's headband.

17:03.322 --> 17:06.780
So, what can I do for you?
(Logan)
Is Korey close to her mother?

17:07.792 --> 17:10.694
When she was alive.
Breast cancer, four years ago.

17:11.130 --> 17:13.359
(Mitch)
I wish she could
see her kid now.

17:13.432 --> 17:14.990
But, anyway,
now it's just me, you know.

17:15.067 --> 17:18.559
I take care of the business,
I take care
of the travel arrangements.

17:18.637 --> 17:21.196
You know,
this is the only time
we're home all year.

17:21.272 --> 17:23.400
Doesrt sound like
much of a life for a kid.

17:23.474 --> 17:26.000
If Korey didn't love it,
she wouldn't do it.

17:26.078 --> 17:28.376
I'm not Joyce Brothers,
I'm only her father.

17:28.446 --> 17:30.438
I'm doing
what I think is best.

17:30.716 --> 17:31.944
And when
you're not looking?

17:32.017 --> 17:33.314
Like I told you,
she's a teenager.

17:33.385 --> 17:36.445
I do everything I can
to keep Korey from ruining
what we've worked for.

17:36.522 --> 17:39.013
But there are a lot of
bad influences out there.

17:39.091 --> 17:41.821
For example?
For example, Alison Hall.

17:42.127 --> 17:45.062
She's a country-club brat.
She plays tennis for a hobby,
kind of like...

17:45.130 --> 17:48.156
Prince Charles with his polo.
Korey doesn't need that.

17:48.700 --> 17:50.964
Well, all work and no play.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.971
Korey is primed to be
the best in the world.

17:54.306 --> 17:56.331
Now, what am I supposed to do,
let her sleaze around...

17:56.408 --> 17:58.433
with a bunch
of trust-fund kids?

17:59.078 --> 18:01.808
We just went into Gannors
to play pool.

18:01.880 --> 18:04.075
I don't even think
Korey had anything to drink.

18:04.149 --> 18:07.516
This was not a big deal,
no matter what Mr. Burke says.

18:08.020 --> 18:10.580
Take it easy.
We're not
the liquor authorities.

18:10.656 --> 18:13.352
So was Korey involved
with any of your friends?

18:13.492 --> 18:15.323
Involved how?

18:15.861 --> 18:18.091
Do I have to draw you
a picture?
(Alison)
No.

18:18.330 --> 18:20.264
She wasrt going with anybody.

18:20.399 --> 18:22.128
What do you care, anyway?

18:22.367 --> 18:25.768
Mr. Burke doesn't have very
nice things to say about...

18:25.838 --> 18:27.703
the people you hang out with.

18:28.006 --> 18:30.338
So what? It doesn't mean
one of my friends
attacked her.

18:30.409 --> 18:32.468
Well, we're not
accusing anybody, Alison.

18:32.544 --> 18:35.843
But if you have somebody
in mind, I'm all ears.

18:36.115 --> 18:39.573
You were scheduled to play
Korey in the first round
of the Slims next week, right?

18:39.651 --> 18:42.279
That's right.
And I was looking forward
to kicking her butt.

18:42.354 --> 18:44.879
From what I read,
Korey beats you
on a pretty regular basis.

18:44.957 --> 18:48.017
So do between 70 and 80
other girls out there.

18:48.594 --> 18:51.563
Look,
Korey's a couple of years
younger than I am...

18:51.964 --> 18:56.333
but she's my hero.
She's got more talent,
more focus.

18:56.935 --> 18:59.495
More trophies.
(Alison)
A lot more trophies.

18:59.738 --> 19:02.571
Sounds like you have
a much better chance
of winning one next week.

19:02.641 --> 19:05.439
With Korey out,
you get a bye
in the first round.

19:05.544 --> 19:09.173
Now you're accusing me.
I wanted to play
Korey next week.

19:09.548 --> 19:14.144
On a good day I'm ranked 82nd.
I beat Number 81, who cares?

19:14.486 --> 19:18.286
I beat Korey Burke,
maybe they put my name
on a running shoe.

19:19.424 --> 19:23.520
She's got high hopes.
A healthy Korey Burke,
and it's six-love, six-love.

19:23.829 --> 19:27.128
What if the guy
with the stick was
a little overenthusiastic?

19:27.199 --> 19:29.929
You mean he was supposed
to bend, not break?

19:30.569 --> 19:32.696
Well, a few bruises,
a few tears.

19:32.905 --> 19:36.136
Korey can still play,
but she's spooked.

19:36.475 --> 19:38.500
Yeah,
and Alison kicks her butt.

19:38.710 --> 19:40.610
Alison was the first one
to that locker room.

19:40.679 --> 19:42.874
She could've let someone
in through the fire exit.

19:42.948 --> 19:44.973
That still leaves us
with the missing link.

19:45.050 --> 19:46.449
What, the guy with
the black jacket?

19:46.518 --> 19:48.884
Sounds like the dress code
at Gannors.

19:53.058 --> 19:54.286
Alison Hall.

19:54.359 --> 19:58.022
Absolut soda
with a beer chaser.
She likes the corner table.

19:58.130 --> 19:59.893
Plenty of room
for her posse.

19:59.965 --> 20:02.866
Any of them tall, dark,
and quick with his fists?

20:02.968 --> 20:04.128
Yeah, there's been a few.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.330
(Logan)
How about in the last month
or two?

20:07.539 --> 20:10.667
I keep track of her drinks,
not who's running in and out
of her bedroom.

20:10.742 --> 20:14.143
Same way you don't keep track
of who comes in with phony ID?

20:15.147 --> 20:17.012
I think you better stop
dancing around...

20:17.082 --> 20:19.073
the questions
and just answer them.

20:21.119 --> 20:23.110
All right, let me think.

20:24.990 --> 20:27.083
It's Marc. Marc Kenner.

20:28.293 --> 20:30.193
He said he was
some kind of bodyguard...

20:30.262 --> 20:33.390
to the stars, or something.
Got his black belt in Japan.

20:33.498 --> 20:36.194
If you ask me,
the only belts he has
are out of the bottle.

20:36.268 --> 20:38.065
Were he and Alison an item?

20:38.537 --> 20:40.368
Some girls like them stupid.

20:40.572 --> 20:42.267
Well, when he's not
breaking plywood...

20:42.341 --> 20:44.275
with his head,
how does he make a living?

20:44.343 --> 20:45.537
He's a bouncer.

20:45.611 --> 20:48.580
Last I heard,
he was working the door
down at BZ's.

20:48.714 --> 20:50.807
After hours place
in the Village.

20:51.283 --> 20:53.774
dd <i>[music playing]</i>

20:55.587 --> 20:58.420
Sorry, pops,
you and granddad
got to wait in line.

20:58.490 --> 21:00.651
Nice jacket.
You Marc Kenner?

21:01.059 --> 21:02.253
So you know my name.

21:02.327 --> 21:03.885
If you're not
on the guest list,
you don't get in.

21:03.962 --> 21:06.692
Actually,
you're on our guest list.

21:07.065 --> 21:11.024
Okay, we can talk inside.
Nah,
I got enough hearing damage.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.936
We got a better place to talk.
Come on.
Nick.

21:15.207 --> 21:17.072
(Briscoe)
We got a search warrant
for his jacket...

21:17.142 --> 21:18.609
and sent it down
to Forensics.

21:18.677 --> 21:21.339
Lucky for us, Mr. Kenner
doesn't have
a real big wardrobe.

21:21.413 --> 21:23.881
Yeah,
he's sucking on a lollipop,
waiting for his lawyer.

21:23.949 --> 21:26.417
At least he knows the drill.
(Briscoe)
He should.

21:26.518 --> 21:29.453
Mark Kenner.
Numerous convictions
for misdemeanor assault...

21:29.521 --> 21:32.820
drug possession,
petty larceny.
He's been a bad boy.

21:33.191 --> 21:36.388
I talked to Forensics.
No blood on Kenner's jacket.

21:36.495 --> 21:38.326
They're sending up a report.

21:38.563 --> 21:40.588
Well, there goes
our slam dunk.

21:40.899 --> 21:43.493
Mr. Kenner doesn't know
what's on his jacket.

21:44.002 --> 21:47.062
See if we can't lose that
report for a couple of hours.

21:48.840 --> 21:51.365
My client doesn't even know
what Korey Burke looks like.

21:51.443 --> 21:52.535
Oh, yeah?

21:52.611 --> 21:54.238
So you read
the sports section...

21:54.313 --> 21:56.213
but you don't look
at the pictures, huh?

21:56.281 --> 21:57.873
(Briscoe)
How about Alison Hall?

21:57.949 --> 22:00.577
You got a pretty good
look at her, didn't you?

22:00.886 --> 22:03.184
So I tossed her around
the sack a few times.

22:03.255 --> 22:05.951
Big deal.
Well, after you caught
your breath...

22:06.024 --> 22:08.754
did she ask you
to take a whack at Korey?

22:09.661 --> 22:11.754
I don't have to sit here
and listen to this crap.

22:11.830 --> 22:14.196
Maybe you'd be more
comfortable upstate.

22:15.167 --> 22:18.967
Is that supposed to scare me?
You don't know
who you're screwing with.

22:19.338 --> 22:22.068
I know people.
We know people, too, Marc.

22:23.108 --> 22:24.735
They wear
little white coats...

22:24.810 --> 22:27.108
and they look
through microscopes,
and right now...

22:27.179 --> 22:28.874
they're looking
at your jacket.

22:28.947 --> 22:31.381
(Briscoe)
When you put your fist
in Korey's face...

22:31.516 --> 22:34.314
don't you think
she bled on you a little?

22:36.755 --> 22:38.552
(Logan)
I'm giving you 30 seconds.

22:38.623 --> 22:41.786
And then I'm walking out
that door and I'm going
to get that report.

22:41.860 --> 22:45.796
And then a big,
iron door is going
to slam shut in your face.

22:46.565 --> 22:49.796
And that means
the store's closed, son.

22:50.202 --> 22:51.726
No more deals.

22:52.037 --> 22:54.733
Your attorney here can explain
the whole concept to you.

22:54.806 --> 22:57.400
Hope you brought
a toothbrush.
Wait.

23:09.588 --> 23:11.613
This is strictly
off the record...

23:11.857 --> 23:15.020
until we get something
in writing from
the D.A.'s office.

23:18.196 --> 23:20.187
Alison gave me
$10,000.

23:21.633 --> 23:23.294
I did her a favor.

23:24.736 --> 23:26.203
[Whistling]

23:38.183 --> 23:42.313
You guys following me around?
Well, not into the water.
You mind?

23:50.162 --> 23:51.254
Game. Set. Match.

23:51.329 --> 23:54.127
Alison Hall,
you're under arrest
for assault.

23:54.666 --> 23:56.065
You have the right
to remain silent.

23:56.134 --> 23:59.797
Anything you say
can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

24:00.138 --> 24:02.402
"Docket number 622083.

24:02.474 --> 24:04.271
"People verses
Alison Marissa Hall.

24:04.342 --> 24:06.139
"Charges are assault
in the first degree...

24:06.211 --> 24:08.577
"and conspiracy
to commit assault
in the first degree."

24:08.647 --> 24:11.275
(Zinns)
It's obvious what's
going on here, Your Honor.

24:11.349 --> 24:13.977
The D.A.'s office is trying
to grab headlines.

24:14.052 --> 24:16.213
They're entitled to their
15 minutes like everyone else.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.415
Isn't it bad enough that our
celebrities are victimized...

24:18.490 --> 24:20.617
by the public?
Now the state
has to follow suit?

24:20.692 --> 24:22.216
I've been to Flushing Meadow,
Counselor.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.694
I think you're giving
your client too much credit.

24:24.763 --> 24:27.288
Now, what does she have
to say for herself?

24:28.300 --> 24:29.426
Not guilty.

24:29.668 --> 24:32.728
People request bail
of $100,000, Your Honor.

24:32.804 --> 24:33.862
Sold.

24:35.540 --> 24:37.531
You've been reading
too much Robert Ludlum, Ben.

24:37.609 --> 24:38.598
Hit men...

24:38.677 --> 24:41.646
Conspiracy?
Oh, it's a conspiracy, Joan.

24:41.713 --> 24:44.739
And like most,
the weakest link
will eventually break.

24:45.050 --> 24:46.176
Mr. Kenner?

24:46.351 --> 24:48.444
He crawls out of a sewer
and into a courtroom...

24:48.520 --> 24:50.351
and you expect
a jury to believe him?

24:50.422 --> 24:53.220
We happen to believe him.
Marc Kenner's a jerk.

24:53.325 --> 24:56.158
Two months ago,
I had to call the cops to toss
him out of my apartment.

24:56.228 --> 24:58.560
You obviously
patched things up.

24:59.264 --> 25:03.724
Now, we're willing to talk
a deal to save your client
the embarrassment of a trial.

25:03.869 --> 25:05.393
You know what I'm going to do,
Ben?

25:05.470 --> 25:09.065
I'm going to give you
a preview of my
closing statement right now.

25:09.140 --> 25:12.473
I'm going to turn to the jury,
I'm going to look straight
in their eyes...

25:12.544 --> 25:14.569
and I'm going to say,
"Why?"

25:14.713 --> 25:17.045
Motive's not part
of the prima facie case.

25:17.115 --> 25:20.881
But nine times out of ten,
lack of it translates
into reasonable doubt.

25:20.952 --> 25:23.887
Save your breath on the deal,
Ben.
Let's go, Alison.

25:29.261 --> 25:32.389
Well, she's right.
The crime doesn't make sense.

25:32.664 --> 25:36.259
It may not make sense now,
but there may be something
we don't know about.

25:36.334 --> 25:39.792
Yeah, well, if Alison Hall
had something to gain, maybe.

25:40.639 --> 25:42.163
You think she's gonna
knock off the top...

25:42.240 --> 25:44.800
100 players in the game
just to get seeded
in the Open?

25:44.876 --> 25:47.037
Some crimes are senseless,
Adam.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.847
People who commit them
don't hire a hit man.

25:49.915 --> 25:51.644
The girls had
some kind of relationship.

25:51.716 --> 25:53.206
Alison Hall
was at the scene.

25:53.285 --> 25:55.776
That adds credibility
to Kenner's statement.

25:55.854 --> 25:58.755
Ben, Marc Kenner's attorney's
in your office.

25:59.424 --> 26:00.413
Thanks.

26:01.159 --> 26:03.491
(Hellman)
What do you say we cut
right to the chase?

26:03.562 --> 26:05.723
My client's
recanting his statement.

26:05.797 --> 26:07.230
What is your explanation
for that?

26:07.299 --> 26:10.530
He lied on his statement
because he was abused
as a child?

26:10.735 --> 26:12.703
No. He's not guilty,
period.

26:13.171 --> 26:16.072
He's already confessed.
That confession
was illegally obtained.

26:16.141 --> 26:18.109
(Stone)
He signed the Miranda waivers,
Max.

26:18.176 --> 26:20.371
You were sitting next to him
when he made the statement.

26:20.445 --> 26:23.608
And we were both bamboozled by
Detectives Briscoe and Logan.

26:23.682 --> 26:25.809
They out and out lied
about the existence of...

26:25.884 --> 26:27.909
incriminatory
forensic evidence...

26:27.986 --> 26:30.181
i.e., the victim's blood
on my client's jacket.

26:30.255 --> 26:32.416
Excuse me,
but I read their report.

26:32.557 --> 26:35.117
They said specifically
that they were waiting
for the paperwork...

26:35.193 --> 26:37.252
from Forensics.
(Hellman)
Sure, that's what they said.

26:37.329 --> 26:39.854
But the fact is,
they already knew the results.

26:39.931 --> 26:43.492
You see, Ben, in my business
it pays to do your homework.

26:43.668 --> 26:47.399
It all boils down to
my client was
intentionally misled. Ergo...

26:47.739 --> 26:49.673
the confession
wasrt voluntary. Ergo...

26:49.741 --> 26:51.538
oh, hell, you know the rest.

26:51.810 --> 26:54.540
Max, the Supreme Court.
(Hellman)
Save it for Judge Lenz.

26:54.613 --> 26:57.411
Tomorrow morning,
9:30 in the A.M.

27:01.953 --> 27:04.581
It's black letter law.
To be admissible...

27:04.656 --> 27:08.148
a confession must be obtained
without police coercion
of any kind.

27:08.226 --> 27:10.694
(Stone)
At all times during the
interrogation, Your Honor...

27:10.762 --> 27:12.730
the defendant
was represented by counsel.

27:12.797 --> 27:16.096
(Hellman)
And I'm here to say that
counsel was equally duped.

27:16.267 --> 27:18.326
I ask, what is the difference
between...

27:18.403 --> 27:22.464
shining a bright light
in a mars eyes for 10 hours
and manipulating...

27:22.540 --> 27:24.269
a confession out of him
with lies?

27:24.342 --> 27:26.606
The Supreme Court thinks
there's a big difference.

27:26.678 --> 27:28.077
Thank you, Miss Kincaid.

27:28.146 --> 27:31.513
Why don't you tell
Mr. Hellman here all about
the Moran case?

27:32.183 --> 27:35.050
So long as the suspect
understands the bare
essentials of his...

27:35.120 --> 27:37.452
Miranda Rights,
no type of police deception...

27:37.522 --> 27:40.252
will vitiate the waiver
of those rights.

27:40.892 --> 27:43.122
You should keep up with
your reading, Mr. Hellman.

27:43.194 --> 27:46.527
I have a heavy case load,
Your Honor.

27:46.731 --> 27:48.631
I don't have time
for advance sheets.

27:48.700 --> 27:52.761
Then hire an associate.
Moran was a 1986 decision.

27:54.739 --> 27:55.831
That's it?

27:56.708 --> 27:58.505
You're going to let
the confession stand?

27:58.576 --> 28:01.568
Your client's guilty,
isn't he?
Thank you, Your Honor.

28:01.646 --> 28:03.671
Not so fast, Mr. Stone.

28:05.917 --> 28:08.477
I'll give you one more shot,
Mr. Hellman.

28:08.687 --> 28:11.952
Your Fifth Amendment
argument didn't work.
What comes next?

28:12.424 --> 28:13.721
You want a hint?

28:13.792 --> 28:15.589
Two words: Due process.

28:15.660 --> 28:17.787
(Stone)
Your Honor, Moran implied...

28:17.896 --> 28:21.059
that police deception
does not violate due process
unless it shocks...

28:21.132 --> 28:24.932
the sensibility of the court.
A couple of cops
faking forensic evidence?

28:25.403 --> 28:27.394
That shocks
the hell out of me.

28:27.472 --> 28:30.999
The confession is out.
So is anything
arising therefrom.

28:32.577 --> 28:36.638
We get the only judge
who actually reads
Supreme Court dicta.

28:37.015 --> 28:39.074
The confessiors
inadmissible
against Kenner.

28:39.150 --> 28:40.981
We can still use it
against Alison Hall.

28:41.052 --> 28:44.510
He won't repeat it
in a courtroom unless
I deal him down to nothing.

28:44.589 --> 28:47.524
I'm not ready to do that.
This is great.

28:47.592 --> 28:50.186
We know who did it,
but we have
no evidence proving it.

28:50.261 --> 28:54.391
Well, maybe we will
if we find out
why it was done.

28:56.034 --> 28:58.867
I'm lost here.
You know Alison did it.
What's the problem?

28:58.937 --> 29:01.462
Trying to prove it
is another story, sir.

29:01.706 --> 29:05.073
Korey,
can you think of any reason
why she'd want to hurt you?

29:05.310 --> 29:07.335
It's not like
we're in competition,
or anything.

29:07.412 --> 29:10.643
It doesn't make sense.
She's crazy.
What else is there?

29:11.516 --> 29:13.677
Your coach told the police
you used to be friends.

29:13.752 --> 29:15.913
Yeah. We used to.

29:16.254 --> 29:18.688
But I told Korey
to stay away from her.
I was right.

29:18.757 --> 29:21.851
Korey, when you stopped
being friends,
was Alison angry?

29:22.026 --> 29:24.654
No. We're not enemies.

29:24.729 --> 29:25.923
I can't believe she'd do it.

29:25.997 --> 29:27.692
(Mitch)
Look, you're a winner,
she's a loser.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.563
What else
is there to know?

29:30.034 --> 29:31.661
Mr. Burke,
it's not that simple.

29:31.736 --> 29:33.101
(Mitch)
It is for me, Miss Kincaid.

29:33.171 --> 29:34.638
I'm not gonna let her
get away with this...

29:34.706 --> 29:36.367
and I don't care
how much money it takes.

29:36.441 --> 29:37.430
Dad, what's the point?

29:37.509 --> 29:38.703
Point is you're not
gonna play...

29:38.777 --> 29:40.210
for six months.
Then there's a trial?

29:40.278 --> 29:43.475
Look, I don't need that.
I just want to forget
about it.

29:44.883 --> 29:48.341
You get that woman,
Mr. Stone,
and you put her in jail.

29:49.354 --> 29:50.651
Come on, Korey.

29:54.225 --> 29:55.214
(coach)
Alison and Korey...

29:55.293 --> 29:56.658
came up through
the Pee-Wees together...

29:56.728 --> 29:58.423
always finishing
one, two.

29:58.496 --> 29:59.929
When Alison was 15...

29:59.998 --> 30:03.297
she demolished Korey
at the finals
for the National Juniors.

30:03.434 --> 30:05.994
Next year, Korey took off
for fame and fortune,
and Alison...

30:06.070 --> 30:08.868
well, she's not going
to be in any record books.

30:08.973 --> 30:11.669
They still practiced together.
That was Korey's idea.

30:11.743 --> 30:14.507
She's very faithful
to her friends.

30:14.579 --> 30:16.877
If one of my buddies
was on the cover
of <i>Tennis Digest...</i>

30:16.948 --> 30:20.611
three months running while
I'm stuck shagging
my own practice balls...

30:20.685 --> 30:22.653
I'd sure resent
the hell out of it.

30:22.720 --> 30:24.483
Let's take a break.

30:25.256 --> 30:27.383
Did Alison
ever say as much?

30:27.625 --> 30:30.185
Not in front of me.
Korey never mentioned it.

30:31.196 --> 30:32.891
I guess Alisors happy,
though.

30:32.964 --> 30:35.091
She finally beat
a seeded player.

30:36.201 --> 30:38.726
Korey wants us to drop
the case against her.

30:39.537 --> 30:41.164
That sounds
just like Korey.

30:41.239 --> 30:43.434
She probably feels sorry
for Alison.

30:44.075 --> 30:46.066
Korey had a couple
of accidents
the past few years...

30:46.144 --> 30:47.771
but now she was healthy.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.404
This was going
to be her breakaway year.

30:49.480 --> 30:51.380
We all expected
great things.

30:51.516 --> 30:52.744
It could still happen.

30:52.817 --> 30:55.581
Yeah, that's what Mitch
would like to believe.
But in my experience...

30:55.653 --> 30:58.554
at Korey's age,
six months off the court...

30:58.823 --> 31:00.313
could be a lifetime.

31:00.692 --> 31:03.422
It could take years
to get back into the top 10.

31:03.828 --> 31:06.991
The only difference
between Korey and someone
like Alison is motivation.

31:07.065 --> 31:08.862
I've heard
Mitch's pep talks.

31:08.933 --> 31:11.766
Shades of my father
when I was doing
track in high school.

31:11.836 --> 31:13.599
Yeah, Mitch lays it
on a little thick.

31:13.671 --> 31:14.899
I've talked to him
about it.

31:14.973 --> 31:17.498
But so far,
whatever he does
seems to work.

31:18.443 --> 31:20.377
If I don't care whether Alison
goes to jail or not...

31:20.445 --> 31:22.276
why should you care so much?

31:23.448 --> 31:25.848
She paid someone
to viciously attack you.

31:26.484 --> 31:28.076
That's a crime, Korey.

31:28.653 --> 31:31.019
Don't you think
she should be punished?

31:32.223 --> 31:35.420
The papers have
ripped her apart.
She's been punished enough.

31:35.493 --> 31:38.394
Your coach feels
she's very jealous
of your success.

31:41.232 --> 31:43.462
I don't believe it.
She'd have to be sick.

31:43.534 --> 31:45.866
Your father thinks so.

31:49.507 --> 31:51.031
Don't you think
Alison needs help?

31:51.109 --> 31:52.701
Can't you just
leave this alone?

31:52.777 --> 31:55.905
It's not that easy.
She might even try it again.

31:57.815 --> 31:58.975
I doubt it.

31:59.284 --> 32:01.809
I don't think you understand...
No. You...

32:03.021 --> 32:04.648
don't understand.

32:11.229 --> 32:14.756
It's not that bad.
I'll live.

32:17.568 --> 32:18.660
Besides...

32:21.205 --> 32:24.368
I already told my father
I wanted to quit tennis,
anyway.

32:28.446 --> 32:31.279
If you ask me,
I think she's a little
too forgiving.

32:31.349 --> 32:33.943
Yeah,
well someone ought to tell her
that revenge...

32:34.018 --> 32:36.350
is one of your
four major food groups.

32:37.121 --> 32:38.520
She's not even
20 years old.

32:38.589 --> 32:40.022
The media won't
let her breathe...

32:40.091 --> 32:41.683
it's understandable
she wants out.

32:41.759 --> 32:43.989
Well,
if she really wants out...

32:44.362 --> 32:46.159
she can disappear
into the woodwork...

32:46.230 --> 32:49.063
after she helps us
convict the other girl.

32:49.200 --> 32:52.260
That's precisely what she's
trying to avoid by retiring.

32:52.337 --> 32:54.498
Cover-up?
(Stone)
She won't cooperate, Adam...

32:54.572 --> 32:56.506
she doesn't think
a crime's been committed.

32:56.574 --> 33:00.032
So she throws away
a multi-million-dollar
career...

33:00.712 --> 33:02.805
to protect a friend
who broke her arm.

33:02.880 --> 33:04.780
We should all inspire
such loyalty.

33:04.849 --> 33:07.079
This might sound crazy,
but bear with me.

33:07.151 --> 33:10.712
Now, if Korey had retired
before the attack,
who's the big loser?

33:10.922 --> 33:12.856
(Stone)
Aside from losing
her winnings...

33:12.924 --> 33:16.360
her corporation would
breach endorsement contracts
won'th millions.

33:16.427 --> 33:18.827
But if she's forced to retire
because of a mugging...

33:18.896 --> 33:20.625
she'd get overwhelming
public sympathy.

33:20.698 --> 33:23.030
(Stone)
Where are you going with this,
Claire?

33:23.101 --> 33:26.298
Mitchell Burke owns
50% of the corporation,
doesn't he?

33:26.371 --> 33:28.498
We've been killing ourselves
looking for a motive.

33:28.573 --> 33:29.972
What's better than greed?

33:30.041 --> 33:31.872
Maybe Korey doesn't want
to pursue this case...

33:31.943 --> 33:34.776
because she doesn't want
her father to go to jail.

33:35.880 --> 33:38.542
I can't believe this.
The man would have
to be a monster.

33:38.616 --> 33:41.414
You've seen what he's like.
His whole life is Korey.

33:41.486 --> 33:42.817
She tells him
she wants to quit.

33:42.887 --> 33:44.878
His motivational speeches
don't work.

33:44.956 --> 33:47.823
He makes the best of what
he perceives as a disaster.

33:47.892 --> 33:50.292
Then why did Kenner sic us
onto Alison Hall?

33:50.361 --> 33:52.852
We know Alison
had an up and down
relationship with Kenner.

33:52.930 --> 33:54.124
Look at his rap sheet.

33:54.198 --> 33:57.031
He could have lied
for a dozen different reasons
we'd never know about.

33:57.101 --> 34:00.332
The problem is,
Kenner has no incentive
to talk to us now.

34:00.471 --> 34:02.598
Who knows,
you may be right. So <i>...</i>

34:03.508 --> 34:04.497
[sighs]

34:04.842 --> 34:06.639
Get Mitchell Burke in here.

34:07.178 --> 34:10.944
What is it with you people?
I would never do anything
in the world to hurt Korey.

34:11.014 --> 34:13.347
(Stone)
She told you
she wanted to retire.

34:13.418 --> 34:14.976
Every kid
goes through that.

34:15.053 --> 34:17.385
You keep them going.
That's not the only thing
involved...

34:17.455 --> 34:19.719
here, sir.
You both stand to lose
a lot of money.

34:19.956 --> 34:22.447
Money?
You think I'm in this
for the money?

34:23.061 --> 34:24.391
Let me ask you something.

34:24.462 --> 34:27.761
Have you ever even been
close to being the best
in the world at anything?

34:27.831 --> 34:28.992
The fact is...
(Mitch)
The fact is...

34:29.067 --> 34:32.833
that the minute I put a racket
in Korey's hand I knew
she had something special.

34:32.904 --> 34:35.395
I played competitive tennis,
Miss Kincaid.

34:36.407 --> 34:37.931
High school, college.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.840
The best I ever did
was the quarter finals
in the state.

34:40.911 --> 34:42.469
But Korey.
Korey, has a natural talent...

34:42.547 --> 34:44.174
and I have spent
my whole life...

34:44.248 --> 34:46.112
making sure that
she doesn't waste it.

34:46.184 --> 34:48.083
And I would damn sure
never do anything...

34:48.152 --> 34:49.176
to destroy it!

34:49.253 --> 34:52.188
Then doesn't it make you
angry that she wants
to throw that away?

34:52.255 --> 34:55.054
She'll get over it.
She needs tennis.
She needs tennis.

34:55.393 --> 34:57.884
Tennis is the one place
where she can be a winner.

34:57.962 --> 34:59.930
And that's what the people
in this world respect.

34:59.997 --> 35:03.091
Winning. Without it,
they'll eat her alive.

35:05.403 --> 35:07.769
Now, if you have
any further questions...

35:07.839 --> 35:09.568
you know where to find me.

35:21.085 --> 35:24.145
How easy do you think
it would be to say to him:

35:24.622 --> 35:26.419
"Dad, I'm quitting"?

35:27.925 --> 35:31.361
Well, it's obvious that he is
obsessed with her success.

35:33.397 --> 35:36.560
Korey's had
a series of accidents
for the past two years.

35:38.769 --> 35:40.794
Last year
it was a fender-bender.

35:40.872 --> 35:42.499
Korey sprained her knee.

35:43.574 --> 35:45.064
The year before that...

35:45.143 --> 35:48.044
she took a header
down the stairs.
Bruised shoulder.

35:48.746 --> 35:50.213
And the year before that...

35:50.281 --> 35:52.681
she sliced her finger
opening a can of peas.

35:53.217 --> 35:55.048
Girl's been
keeping us busy.

35:55.286 --> 35:59.120
You'd think someone who makes
her living as an athlete
would be more careful.

35:59.190 --> 36:01.158
Bobby Ojeda,
when he was with the Mets...

36:01.225 --> 36:04.683
nearly cut off his finger
trimming the hedges
in his backyard.

36:05.329 --> 36:06.921
Just because
they're pros...

36:06.998 --> 36:10.456
doesn't mean
they're not subject
to the normal human frailties.

36:10.768 --> 36:12.668
Year after year
after year?

36:12.870 --> 36:15.430
You never thought
that was a little strange?

36:15.506 --> 36:16.495
[Sighs]

36:17.675 --> 36:19.040
Yes, I did.

36:19.410 --> 36:21.571
That's why I sent her
to Dr. Styne.

36:21.979 --> 36:24.243
He's a psychiatrist.
Handles athletes.

36:24.649 --> 36:27.174
He's been seeing her
for a couple of years.

36:30.755 --> 36:33.246
Tennis players,
figure skaters, golfers...

36:33.324 --> 36:34.518
they can have
an army of...

36:34.592 --> 36:38.050
trainers, coaches, managers,
but when it comes down to it,
they're out there alone.

36:38.129 --> 36:40.290
No teammates
to blame for failure.

36:40.598 --> 36:42.964
No teammates with whom
to share success.

36:43.067 --> 36:45.535
Always on the road,
no time to themselves...

36:45.603 --> 36:48.663
no privacy.
When you're world-class,
you don't make small mistakes.

36:48.739 --> 36:50.468
They're also treated
like royalty.

36:50.541 --> 36:53.669
Girls like Korey,
I envy their talent.
I don't envy their lives.

36:53.744 --> 36:57.111
No matter how miserable
they get, no one wants
to hear their stories.

36:57.181 --> 37:00.810
Can you imagine feeling sorry
for them with their looks
and talent and money?

37:00.885 --> 37:02.546
How do you
deal with that?

37:02.620 --> 37:05.817
Well, the best I've come up
with is having them keep
a daily journal.

37:05.890 --> 37:07.915
It appears to help relieve
some of the stress.

37:07.992 --> 37:10.552
A teenage girl
who can't handle the pressure.

37:11.295 --> 37:12.762
How would she react?

37:12.830 --> 37:15.298
The lucky ones quit.
Others overeat.

37:15.399 --> 37:17.196
Some party all night.

37:18.636 --> 37:20.797
Do any become
self-destructive?

37:22.673 --> 37:24.038
Hypothetically...

37:24.709 --> 37:28.145
the subconscious may cause
one to become accident-prone.

37:28.646 --> 37:30.045
(Stone)
You sit in the stands
and cheer...

37:30.114 --> 37:31.604
and you never really
know what's...

37:31.682 --> 37:33.377
going on inside their heads.

37:33.451 --> 37:36.716
The psychiatrist said
it's possible that
she might injure herself.

37:36.787 --> 37:38.846
That's a far cry
from hiring a hit man.

37:38.923 --> 37:42.120
You said she kept a diary.
Maybe there's some
help in there for us.

37:42.193 --> 37:43.592
If she actually
did this to herself...

37:43.661 --> 37:45.458
do you really think
she belongs in prison?

37:45.529 --> 37:47.394
I know Kenner
belongs in prison.

37:47.465 --> 37:49.695
And we have no basis
to request the diary.

37:49.767 --> 37:52.861
If there's exculpatory
evidence inside it, we do.

37:52.970 --> 37:56.929
We have to tell Alison Hall,
because there's charges
pending against her.

37:57.708 --> 38:00.199
Arert you forgetting?
My client is not
the defendant here.

38:00.278 --> 38:03.304
If her diary contains
information that proves
Miss Hall...

38:03.381 --> 38:06.646
innocent,
you know damn well
we're obliged to turn it over.

38:07.118 --> 38:09.678
You can't turn it over
if you don't have it.

38:10.054 --> 38:13.217
If you don't have it,
you're not violating
any ethical obligation.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.953
Ross, look at it this way.
We look through the diary,
if there's...

38:16.027 --> 38:19.155
nothing there relevant
to the case,
that's the end of it.

38:19.230 --> 38:20.561
If you don't
let us have it...

38:20.631 --> 38:23.395
we'll be forced to give
notice of its existence
to Alison Hall.

38:23.467 --> 38:24.627
And she may go public.

38:24.702 --> 38:26.727
Wait a minute,
I don't get this.

38:27.238 --> 38:29.365
This girl breaks
my daughter's arm,
and you're...

38:29.440 --> 38:32.034
bending over backwards
to get her off the hook?

38:32.109 --> 38:35.044
Is there something
in the diary that worries you,
Mr. Burke?

38:35.112 --> 38:37.046
What worries me is that
this diary contains...

38:37.114 --> 38:39.173
my daughter's
private thoughts.

38:39.250 --> 38:41.741
And as far as I'm concerned,
that's nobody's business
but hers.

38:41.819 --> 38:43.844
We can make
a motion to produce.

38:47.758 --> 38:50.488
You do what you have to do.

38:53.998 --> 38:55.465
(Fineman)
The Supreme Court
has recognized...

38:55.533 --> 38:57.023
that there are
certain areas of...

38:57.101 --> 39:01.060
human existence that must
remain free of governmental
intrusion.

39:01.939 --> 39:06.069
Clearly, the most fundamental
is the right of an individual
to maintain...

39:06.177 --> 39:07.337
his privacy.

39:09.413 --> 39:12.211
And the courts have been
willing to overlook
such fundamental rights...

39:12.283 --> 39:14.547
when there's been a compelling
state interest to do so.

39:14.618 --> 39:17.052
And what is more compelling
than a situation in which...

39:17.121 --> 39:20.613
the wrong person
may be brought to trial
for a felony?

39:20.691 --> 39:24.218
There is a chance
that Miss Burke's diary could
exculpate the defendant...

39:24.295 --> 39:25.284
Your Honor.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.092
(Fineman)
Chance?
That's not good enough.

39:27.298 --> 39:30.597
Substantive due process
dictates that the means
must...

39:30.668 --> 39:33.034
be necessary
to achieve the end.

39:33.404 --> 39:36.032
Look at
<i>Griswold v. Connecticut.</i>
The court held...

39:36.107 --> 39:37.734
that the right of privacy
includes keeping...

39:37.808 --> 39:39.901
the government
out of our bedrooms.

39:39.977 --> 39:43.174
At best,
the only injury Miss Burke
might suffer is a bit of...

39:43.247 --> 39:46.614
embarrassment, Your Honor.
And what is more sacrosanct...

39:46.684 --> 39:50.484
than one's reputation?
Not much, Mr. Fineman.

39:50.821 --> 39:54.188
Unfortunately,
the Supreme Court
in <i>Paul v. Davis</i> held...

39:54.525 --> 39:58.393
that reputation alone
is not a constitutionally
protected interest.

39:59.463 --> 40:01.624
I direct Miss Burke's diary
be turned over to...

40:01.699 --> 40:04.031
the People no later
than end of business today.

40:04.101 --> 40:05.796
Your Honor...
I'm sorry, Mr. Fineman.

40:05.870 --> 40:08.464
You can assure your client
that the diary will be used...

40:08.539 --> 40:11.030
only for the purposes
discussed here today.

40:11.776 --> 40:14.836
Understood, Mr. Stone?
Yes, Your Honor. Thank you.

40:15.479 --> 40:17.310
(Kincaid)
"I'm tired. I'm bored.

40:17.381 --> 40:19.406
"Alison went
dancing last night.

40:19.683 --> 40:21.480
"She told me
she met some hunk.

40:21.552 --> 40:24.077
"She's so lucky.
She just wants to have fun."

40:25.222 --> 40:28.919
Well, that says it all.
She was jealous of Alison.

40:30.628 --> 40:32.357
Here, this is a month ago:

40:32.963 --> 40:35.454
"I met Alisors
boyfriend at Gannors."

40:36.000 --> 40:40.699
(Stone)
Marc Kenner?
Yeah.
"He's real cute and sexy."

40:42.973 --> 40:45.771
And this one's
a week before the attack.

40:46.877 --> 40:49.971
"I'm scared, but I hope
everything will be okay.

40:50.147 --> 40:54.447
"Marc will take care of it.
Dad will never know."

40:59.457 --> 41:01.288
So she did hire Kenner.

41:01.492 --> 41:04.893
Even if that were a crime,
we can't use the diary
against her.

41:05.463 --> 41:07.226
I don't think we'll have to...

41:07.298 --> 41:09.562
because we can use it
against Kenner.

41:10.634 --> 41:13.159
Korey Burke's diary
implicates your client.

41:13.337 --> 41:14.531
You're kidding, right?

41:14.605 --> 41:17.130
I mean, even I know that's
garden-variety hearsay.

41:17.208 --> 41:20.371
Not if it's a statement
against penal interest.

41:20.444 --> 41:23.072
She wrote that she
and your client conspired...

41:23.147 --> 41:25.240
She conspired
to beat herself up?

41:26.350 --> 41:28.375
Give me a break, Ben.
Where's the crime?

41:28.452 --> 41:31.910
Korey did it so she could
quit the tour and not lose
her endorsements.

41:31.989 --> 41:34.617
(Stone)
We're charging you
with conspiracy to defraud.

41:34.758 --> 41:38.125
The girl has
Fifth Amendment rights.
It's inadmissible.

41:38.295 --> 41:39.592
Not against your client.

41:39.663 --> 41:41.255
Young man,
you're going to prison...

41:41.332 --> 41:44.665
and Korey Burke is laughing
all the way to the bank.

41:54.044 --> 41:55.238
I want a deal.

41:55.312 --> 41:57.803
You've got nothing to tell us,
sir.
Yeah?

41:58.148 --> 42:00.946
You've got it all wrong.
It was the other one
that hired me.

42:01.018 --> 42:03.350
Alison Hall?
Yeah.

42:03.521 --> 42:06.115
Just like I told you
the first time.

42:06.924 --> 42:08.084
[Sighing]

42:08.392 --> 42:12.055
She told me to hit her,
but not to hurt her too bad.

42:13.664 --> 42:15.825
She said it was
to help her friend.

42:17.935 --> 42:19.926
Assault two, Ben?

42:24.308 --> 42:27.835
We'll see how he performs
in front of a grand jury.

42:34.485 --> 42:36.953
The grand jury
returned an indictment
against Alison...

42:37.021 --> 42:39.649
even before Kenner was
on the bus to Ossining.

42:39.757 --> 42:41.247
And what about
Korey Burke?

42:41.325 --> 42:43.657
She gets to walk off
into the sunset?

42:43.861 --> 42:46.694
Other than the diary,
we don't have any evidence
against her.

42:46.764 --> 42:49.892
What the evidence can't do,
I'm hoping
her conscience will.

42:49.967 --> 42:51.059
(Schiff)
And if it doesn't...

42:51.135 --> 42:53.228
our sympathetic friend
who helped her...

42:53.470 --> 42:56.200
spends the next three years
alone regretting it.

42:56.340 --> 42:58.831
I'm not sure either one
belongs in prison.

42:58.909 --> 43:00.240
[Intercom buzzing]

43:02.012 --> 43:03.377
Hello.

43:05.349 --> 43:06.441
Thank you.

43:09.053 --> 43:12.489
Mitchell Burke called.
He wants to come in
with Korey.

43:14.091 --> 43:17.754
When Korey explained
to me what happened,
I could hardly believe it.

43:17.828 --> 43:20.820
I'd rather hear it
from your daughter, sir.
Korey?

43:25.803 --> 43:27.532
It was all my idea.

43:29.039 --> 43:30.836
Alison did it for me.

43:34.845 --> 43:37.006
You have no idea
what it's like.

43:40.884 --> 43:42.875
The pressure. It's <i>...</i>

43:44.722 --> 43:47.555
It's like this big weight
just pounding on my head.

43:53.364 --> 43:55.855
I asked Alison
to do it for me.
I gave her the money.

43:55.933 --> 43:57.833
She didn't do anything wrong.

43:57.968 --> 43:59.833
You both committed a crime,
Korey.

43:59.903 --> 44:01.564
I'm sure they both
learned their lesson.

44:01.639 --> 44:03.766
That's for a judge to decide,
sir.

44:04.274 --> 44:05.263
Korey.

44:06.844 --> 44:10.541
If you had told me
that you wanted to quit,
I would have let you.

44:13.117 --> 44:14.584
You never heard me.

44:18.088 --> 44:20.579
You never took anything
I wanted seriously.

44:21.592 --> 44:24.891
Korey,
you know that's not true.
I was always there for you.

44:27.564 --> 44:29.532
You were so proud.

44:31.368 --> 44:33.029
"Win, Korey...

44:34.605 --> 44:37.335
"and you'll win the trophy.
Win, Korey, and you'll make...

44:37.408 --> 44:40.775
"the Tour. Win, Korey,
and you'll be
the best in the world"<i>...</i>

44:41.478 --> 44:43.173
Korey, you are the best.

44:43.280 --> 44:45.441
I know what it means to you,
Daddy.

44:47.785 --> 44:49.275
I never wanted to <i>...</i>

44:51.121 --> 44:53.646
I know,
I hate still hurting you...

44:53.724 --> 44:54.713
[sniffles]

44:56.126 --> 44:59.061
I just want you to love me
for who I am.

45:05.102 --> 45:06.569
[Korey sobbing]

45:11.008 --> 45:13.238
(Stone)
I'm recommending probation
and 100 hours...

45:13.310 --> 45:15.403
community service
for both of them.

45:15.479 --> 45:17.276
Teaching tennis
to the underprivileged.

45:17.347 --> 45:19.713
Not exactly the life
Korey had planned.

45:20.317 --> 45:22.251
(Schiff)
Most people work a lifetime...

45:22.419 --> 45:24.284
to get to the top
of their profession.

45:24.354 --> 45:26.720
Korey Burke got there
before her twentieth birthday.

45:26.790 --> 45:30.487
Well, she's fortunate.
Now she can get on
with the rest of her life.
