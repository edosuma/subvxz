00:02.640 --> 00:08.800
He's the most unsympathetic, selfish person I've ever met.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.140
I would never touch him.

00:11.140 --> 00:13.140
And you shouldn't either.

00:13.140 --> 00:14.780
You like me.

00:19.520 --> 00:23.980
You should've seen him at William's party,
he was so jealous.

00:23.980 --> 00:27.560
<i>[I heard that the little hipster ex of your friend
got together with Isabel from my class?]</i>

00:34.340 --> 00:37.180
Oh my god, look at this.

00:39.280 --> 00:41.940
Looks good? You think it looks good?
It's hideous.

00:42.200 --> 00:44.540
Can you picture a girl in this?

00:44.760 --> 00:48.220
Yeah, maybe in Syria.
But like, in Norway? No.

00:48.760 --> 00:52.020
Hey welcome back, Noora.

00:53.020 --> 00:56.680
I didn't know you were coming back this afternoon.

00:57.440 --> 00:59.680
This is Lito.

01:02.020 --> 01:03.580
My name is Lito.

01:04.800 --> 01:09.840
We're just going through some of your clothes
to see if there's anything you don't need.

01:11.220 --> 01:13.880
Like this, for example?

01:14.840 --> 01:20.680
Eskild, what are you doing? You can't take
my clothes without asking me first.

01:20.700 --> 01:22.740
Oh I'm sorry, are we imposing?

01:22.820 --> 01:27.240
No, no. Don't be silly.
She never uses clothes like this.

01:27.500 --> 01:31.780
Yeah, we're just going through
your clothes as I said because...

01:31.780 --> 01:34.940
... as you know there's a big crisis
in Syria right now.

01:35.960 --> 01:41.780
There's a lot of Syrian refugees
that need your help.

01:42.960 --> 01:47.060
So I was just thinking you
could donate some.

01:48.360 --> 01:49.480
Okay...

01:50.000 --> 01:54.260
Yes, I guess. But maybe just not that top.

01:54.260 --> 01:59.960
Because it has meaning to me so.

02:02.560 --> 02:06.900
What meaning?
-It's from when I lived in Madrid.

02:11.320 --> 02:14.560
Isn't he handsome?
I think he's gay.

02:15.720 --> 02:21.000
Eskild, what are you doing? You can't
just give away my clothes...

02:21.040 --> 02:24.920
... to a Syrian refugee just to
check him out.

02:25.180 --> 02:28.080
He's not a Syrian refugee.
He studies in Norway.

02:28.080 --> 02:33.000
His father is the Turkish ambassador.

02:33.720 --> 02:41.320
Lito has taken leave from university.
To help the refugees full time.

02:44.260 --> 02:45.280
Sexy?

02:46.200 --> 02:51.560
Sexy? There's nothing sexy about the refugee
crisis. It's incredibly serious.

02:51.720 --> 02:57.680
It's incredibly serious, and you say stuff like:
"Oh no, not that top. It has meaning to me."

02:57.740 --> 03:00.640
See, here she comes. A saint!

03:00.940 --> 03:03.420
Little princess here is rising.
Very good!

03:03.420 --> 03:09.220
Tennis racket, we have a CD player, Rubik's cube.
Lots of hoodies and sweatpants.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.800
Don't know if it's clean.
-Thanks so much, Linn.

03:15.700 --> 03:19.800
You know what Noora,
you're actually a bit stingy.

03:19.980 --> 03:25.000
There are many people who need it
so much more than you.

03:25.100 --> 03:30.900
I'm not stingy.
I care a lot aobut the refugee crisis.

03:30.980 --> 03:34.460
You can't just come into my room and-

03:36.060 --> 03:38.120
Is everything good?

03:39.220 --> 03:40.320
Yes.

03:40.520 --> 03:45.000
Yeah it's all good.
-Everything's fine.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.660
Yeah, it's okay. It's just like...
she loves this top, so...

03:53.640 --> 03:57.840
Yeah but I mean, we got a lot of clothes
and stuff, don't we?

03:59.780 --> 04:03.600
If I take this and this,
you can take the rest.

04:05.640 --> 04:09.020
I'll take this top here, Noora.
You don't need it.

04:10.020 --> 04:15.020
Excuse me?
-Noora, don't be so stingy.

04:34.220 --> 04:36.780
I love dresses with pockets.

04:36.780 --> 04:39.020
It looks hot.

04:39.160 --> 04:43.700
It starts to sink when you have your
cellphone in it.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.700
But this is ugly.

04:45.760 --> 04:49.960
No, nothing is ugly.
But it's a little...

04:52.040 --> 04:53.700
Bye bye.

04:57.180 --> 05:00.960
That one was nice.
I don't wear it. I can't go in white.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.520
I'll get make-up on it and I'll
spill while eating.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.880
You should wear it.

05:10.500 --> 05:11.720
Do you want it?

05:13.160 --> 05:16.780
No, we have to give stuff away.
-Yeah, you need it more than me.

05:16.780 --> 05:21.160
We have to show that we care.
-I care!

05:21.160 --> 05:27.520
You know Eskild...
He said that I don't care.

05:29.700 --> 05:36.200
I do care about the refugee crisis.
It's Eskild who doesn't care.

05:37.660 --> 05:41.840
He's just trying to get with
that Lito guy.

05:42.680 --> 05:47.840
He's convinced that he's gay.
Though he's not.

05:50.580 --> 05:57.760
I don't understand why people who are gay
just assume everyone else is gay too.

05:58.260 --> 06:00.380
What's the deal with that?

06:01.220 --> 06:06.160
Did you happen to hear that it's
over between Isak and Sara?

06:07.300 --> 06:08.280
No.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.020
I think it was her who broke
up with him.

06:17.900 --> 06:19.000
Oh!

06:19.780 --> 06:23.380
This is from Jonas.

06:23.980 --> 06:29.200
I have to give it back to him, right?
It's not that nice, so...

06:30.440 --> 06:35.100
Have you talked to Jonas since
we've come home?

06:36.160 --> 06:42.720
Eh, no. I've tried but I feel like
he's trying to ignore me.

06:45.940 --> 06:53.560
Oh? - I think he's a little embarrassed
about what happened at William's party.

06:54.160 --> 07:00.200
But if he still has feelings for me,
we have to be able to talk about it.

07:00.460 --> 07:03.900
I want us to be friends.
I don't want it to get in the way.

07:05.580 --> 07:10.860
I think it's important that you
guys talk to each other.

07:11.540 --> 07:15.040
Yeah I will. He can't ignore me when
school starts again.

07:19.040 --> 07:23.360
How's it going with you and William?

07:25.620 --> 07:28.380
There is no me and William.

07:29.940 --> 07:32.000
No, I know. I was only joking.

07:34.660 --> 07:39.960
I know that. Vilde would have a
breakdown if she knew.

07:41.440 --> 07:46.500
I've never seen someone so obsessed
with another person. Have you?

07:48.740 --> 07:49.880
No...

07:54.600 --> 07:57.980
You don't think she's going to pay
to hook up, right?

08:00.660 --> 08:02.080
What hook up?

08:03.380 --> 08:09.700
Didn't you see the Penetrator stuff? They're
having a fundraiser. You didn't see it?

08:10.420 --> 08:11.280
No?

08:11.560 --> 08:14.180
Are you kidding me?
Okay, I have to show you.

08:14.460 --> 08:16.720
It's really sick.

08:23.340 --> 08:29.080
During Easter they trashed
a cabin in Trysil.

08:29.320 --> 08:33.820
They got a bill of
300 fucking thousand Kroner.

08:34.100 --> 08:35.340
It's so sick.

08:35.500 --> 08:39.020
So now they're having a fundraiser.

08:39.800 --> 08:44.120
Look: Help the Penetrators.

08:44.220 --> 08:48.640
They're selling sweaters and
there's an auction to hook up with someone.

08:49.200 --> 08:53.420
Hooking up with William starts
at 1000 Kroner. So sick!

08:53.880 --> 08:56.800
They will have a charity party on Friday.

09:01.580 --> 09:05.860
Hello, this is prostitution.

09:07.120 --> 09:11.400
It wouldn't suprise me if Vilde ends
up paying to hook up with William.

09:53.340 --> 09:54.500
Hi.

09:57.480 --> 09:58.900
Willhelm!

10:00.240 --> 10:01.900
Fucking hell, it's
lovely to see you.

10:05.220 --> 10:07.600
Did you miss me?
-No!

10:08.580 --> 10:11.500
Not even a little bit?
-I didn't.

10:13.320 --> 10:15.540
Did you have a good Easter?

10:16.820 --> 10:19.500
Yeah. Did you?

10:20.520 --> 10:22.980
Good, yeah. Just a little wild.

10:25.240 --> 10:30.060
I saw your event on Facebook.
Charming stuff.

10:30.480 --> 10:32.560
You have to come.
-No!

10:32.740 --> 10:33.820
Why not?

10:35.740 --> 10:39.980
Because it's the dumbest thing I've seen in
my entire life.

10:40.740 --> 10:45.140
Hook up auction? Seriously?

10:46.420 --> 10:50.800
You know it's actually illegal? It's prostitution.

10:54.540 --> 10:55.620
Are you jealous?

10:58.120 --> 10:59.200
No.

10:59.480 --> 11:01.520
Because I'll hook up with someone else?

11:01.880 --> 11:03.680
That's why you're
being so grumpy.

11:04.280 --> 11:09.360
I'm not grumpy. And I'm definitely not jealous.

11:10.000 --> 11:15.040
I just think the entire event is horrible.

11:15.520 --> 11:22.100
Europe is in a state of emergency.
Twelve million Syrians are fleeing.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.340
People are dying of hunger.

11:28.540 --> 11:33.080
What does it have to do with this?
-It has everything to do with this!

11:33.120 --> 11:37.980
You guys trashed a cabin
for 300 thousand!

11:38.160 --> 11:41.120
While the world is starving.

11:54.980 --> 11:58.800
Imagine how much people are willing
to spend to hook up.

11:58.880 --> 12:05.300
How high will they go?
Ten thousand Kroner to hook up with someone? No!

12:05.420 --> 12:09.940
Think of... William. It's sick!
-Those people are stupid.

12:09.940 --> 12:14.100
They'll fail to raise it all
on Friday anyway.

12:14.100 --> 12:19.980
There's the hooking up, the sweaters,
partying on their bus with them.

12:20.140 --> 12:28.140
They make a lot of effort.
They care about both-

12:28.140 --> 12:30.140
Hello!
-Hi!

12:34.380 --> 12:36.620
I brought lunch for you as well.

12:39.560 --> 12:40.680
Oh, yeah.

12:43.160 --> 12:46.300
Will you ask Noora, Vilde?
-Yeah!

12:46.300 --> 12:50.700
We were talking about helping the
Penetrator-boys, out of solidarity.

12:51.920 --> 12:57.760
We can use some of the money from our
bus budget for their bus.

12:57.880 --> 13:00.280
But it's a bit boring to just donate money.

13:00.360 --> 13:06.060
So we discussed participating in the hook up
auction. It's for a good cause.

13:07.600 --> 13:10.440
Vilde, what world do you live in?

13:12.700 --> 13:17.640
You know that millions of
refugees are starving?

13:18.240 --> 13:21.180
And you think this is a good cause?

13:21.680 --> 13:27.100
You think that we should give money
to a bunch of asshole kids?

13:27.200 --> 13:32.400
Guys who just got themselves drunk
and trashed an entire cabin?

13:34.140 --> 13:40.000
You don't always need to be so uptight.
Try to have a little humor.

13:40.500 --> 13:45.740
It's a social event that gets the entire
school together. It's not just for fun.

13:45.740 --> 13:50.600
It helps the refugees more than when we
sit at home and be sad for them.

13:50.880 --> 13:57.540
If you used half of the energy you use
to think about William...

13:57.580 --> 14:02.620
... to think of refugees instead,
it might have helped a little bit.

14:08.120 --> 14:11.980
So no hook up auction then?
-No, Vilde.

14:13.120 --> 14:17.540
What about the party?
-Of course we're going to the party.

14:18.600 --> 14:22.160
Are you guys serious now?
-Come on, Noora!

14:23.600 --> 14:29.720
If even Sana thinks it's fun! She knows a litte
bit more about being a refugee than you.

14:30.760 --> 14:32.680
<i>[Since it's so important to you, I've decided we'll donate
10% of all the funds we raise tomorrow to the refugees.]</i>

14:32.680 --> 14:34.900
Why do I know anything about being a refugee?
<i>[Since it's so important to you, I've decided we'll donate
10% of all the funds we raise tomorrow to the refugees.]</i>

14:34.900 --> 14:35.100
<i>[Since it's so important to you, I've decided we'll donate
10% of all the funds we raise tomorrow to the refugees.]</i>

14:35.100 --> 14:36.280
I was born in Norway.
<i>[Since it's so important to you, I've decided we'll donate
10% of all the funds we raise tomorrow to the refugees.]</i>

14:36.280 --> 14:36.960
<i>[Since it's so important to you, I've decided we'll donate
10% of all the funds we raise tomorrow to the refugees.]</i>

14:37.000 --> 14:38.040
<i>[But only if you come to the party.]</i>

14:38.040 --> 14:41.300
Because you're from another culture.
<i>[But only if you come to the party.]</i>

14:41.300 --> 14:42.060
<i>[But only if you come to the party.]</i>

14:42.060 --> 14:44.180
No... I'm from the same culture as you.
<i>[But only if you come to the party.]</i>

14:44.180 --> 14:44.220
<i>[But only if you come to the party.]</i>

14:44.360 --> 14:45.720
<i>[You know you're sick in the head right?]</i>

14:45.720 --> 14:47.360
You're a muslim.
<i>[You know you're sick in the head right?]</i>

14:47.360 --> 14:48.800
<i>[You know you're sick in the head right?]</i>

14:48.800 --> 14:49.920
Eh, yeah?
<i>[You know you're sick in the head right?]</i>

14:49.920 --> 14:50.160
<i>[You know you're sick in the head right?]</i>

14:50.840 --> 14:52.860
Muslim is another culture.

14:54.260 --> 14:57.300
Islam is a religion, Einstein.

14:59.820 --> 15:03.300
What's up today? Is it the pick-on-Vilde day?

15:03.320 --> 15:03.360
<i>[It's you who's sick in the head if you don't come.
Think of the refugees.]</i>

15:03.360 --> 15:05.840
Why are you all ganging up on me?
<i>[It's you who's sick in the head if you don't come.
Think of the refugees.]</i>

15:05.840 --> 15:06.340
<i>[It's you who's sick in the head if you don't come.
Think of the refugees.]</i>

15:06.340 --> 15:12.060
Have you thought about how much of my soul I put into this project?
<i>[It's you who's sick in the head if you don't come.
Think of the refugees.]</i>

15:12.060 --> 15:12.400
<i>[It's you who's sick in the head if you don't come.
Think of the refugees.]</i>

15:12.580 --> 15:12.740
<i>[20%]</i>

15:12.740 --> 15:16.860
It's not to be popular, but to be with you guys.
<i>[20%]</i>

15:16.860 --> 15:16.940
<i>[20%]</i>

15:17.280 --> 15:19.260
It's you I love.

15:22.180 --> 15:23.640
Can you not try to give back a little?
I'm giving you everything. Everything!

15:23.640 --> 15:29.580
<i>[Deal. But then you should be really sweet at the party.]</i>
Can you not try to give back a little?
I'm giving you everything. Everything!

15:29.580 --> 15:31.500
<i>[Deal. But then you should be really sweet at the party.]</i>

15:31.580 --> 15:32.720
Yeah alright!

15:33.300 --> 15:36.180
We're going to the party. Okay!

15:39.100 --> 15:41.180
And.. the hook up auction?

15:42.360 --> 15:44.580
No, Vilde.

15:47.340 --> 15:51.380
Do you want to pay to
hook up with William?

15:54.360 --> 15:55.460
Yes.

15:57.640 --> 16:02.420
You know it's illegal?
It's prostitution.

16:05.180 --> 16:07.700
Not if there's no sex.

16:07.920 --> 16:11.460
It's hooking up.
Sex doesn't fall under hooking up.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.320
Everyone knows that.

16:16.600 --> 16:27.100
<i>[And you've already won the hook up auction.
So you no longer have to be jealous.]</i>

16:27.100 --> 16:46.160
<i>[I'm not jealous and I'm not joining the auction.]</i>

16:46.480 --> 16:55.000
<i>[Yes you are.]</i>

17:09.780 --> 17:13.420
You see that? They care about refugees.

17:13.420 --> 17:15.680
They're not a bunch of assholes.

17:22.640 --> 17:24.080
Hey, there's Jonas!

17:25.220 --> 17:26.420
Yeah...

17:27.040 --> 17:31.380
There's something I have to tell you.
-Yeah?

17:34.960 --> 17:42.540
I had hoped Jonas would
have told you himself.

17:47.640 --> 17:50.380
Jonas is together with Isabel.

17:52.660 --> 17:55.320
They got together on Easter.

18:11.280 --> 18:14.520
Perhaps I should've told you...

18:14.980 --> 18:19.500
... but I thought it would be best
if you heard it from Jonas.

18:20.960 --> 18:24.160
But he never said it, so...

18:33.200 --> 18:34.980
What are you thinking?

18:37.920 --> 18:39.820
I'm fine.

18:45.340 --> 18:48.800
Sure?
-Yeah, yeah!

18:50.920 --> 18:53.760
Eva, you're allowed to be upset.

18:54.260 --> 18:55.960
He's your ex-boyfriend.

18:57.300 --> 19:03.200
I'm not upset. I'm fine, really.

19:03.780 --> 19:11.640
I think it's only good that he moved on.
We really are just friends.

19:14.300 --> 19:15.660
It's fine.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.180
You sure?

19:24.100 --> 19:25.700
Yes, I'm totally sure.

19:27.080 --> 19:28.920
Come, let's party now.

20:18.180 --> 20:20.560
I think he's terribly in love with her.

20:23.280 --> 20:29.940
They say you can see it in the way
he looks at her.

20:30.140 --> 20:37.720
When he looks at her
when she's not looking at him.

20:41.320 --> 20:44.920
He looks so... He smiles at her
in a certain way.

20:45.220 --> 20:50.780
Not really smiling, but you see
something in his eyes.

20:51.120 --> 20:55.880
That he... I don't know.

21:01.620 --> 21:03.400
Do you think she's prettier than me?

21:04.720 --> 21:05.780
Huh?

21:07.260 --> 21:11.040
She is. Much, much prettier than me.

21:11.040 --> 21:15.060
Eva, you have to stop now.
She's not prettier than you.

21:15.060 --> 21:19.940
I just don't understand why
he didn't say anything.

21:20.500 --> 21:22.780
He just pretends like it's nothing.

21:22.800 --> 21:29.280
He has to say he has a girlfriend.
He has to introduce me.

21:29.540 --> 21:34.400
They're going to announce who won
the hook up auction soon.

21:34.880 --> 21:40.560
Where did you see that? -The girl who will
make out with William has paid 3000 Kroner.

21:51.160 --> 21:56.820
You know what? If he hadn't thought
of introducing us to each other...

21:57.600 --> 21:59.180
... then I'll do it myself.

22:17.800 --> 22:22.500
Hi! Isak!
-What's up?

22:26.440 --> 22:28.240
I've missed you.

22:31.060 --> 22:34.000
We never hang out anymore.

22:39.300 --> 22:42.540
You know what?
You're so sweet.

22:44.440 --> 22:49.880
Jonas has a girlfriend!
Did you know? She's a third year.

22:58.860 --> 23:03.100
I've really missed you.
It's so good to see you.

23:06.660 --> 23:09.160
No.
-What?

23:10.300 --> 23:12.100
We'll just drop it.

23:16.280 --> 23:19.620
Don't you want to make
out with me? Huh?

23:19.620 --> 23:22.660
No, we'll just drop it.

23:25.920 --> 23:32.160
Is it because you like guys?

23:37.480 --> 23:40.860
He doesn't want to
make out with me.

23:40.860 --> 23:44.280
We should go drink some water.

23:44.280 --> 23:46.740
... who has won the hook up auction?

23:48.660 --> 23:50.660
The girl who won is...

23:52.460 --> 23:56.140
What are you saying?
I can't hear what you're saying.

23:56.880 --> 23:59.460
I'm not going to say it.
-You're not saying it?

23:59.460 --> 24:02.240
Vilde! Take care of Eva.

24:03.700 --> 24:04.940
She should have water.

24:04.940 --> 24:07.360
Vilde...
-Hi.

24:08.400 --> 24:10.280
I love you.

24:11.520 --> 24:13.280
Should we get you some water?

24:13.340 --> 24:16.760
Isak doesn't want to make out with me.
-No, he doesn't?

24:17.800 --> 24:20.080
But... Hi!

24:22.200 --> 24:24.300
Do you want to make out with me?

24:33.340 --> 24:34.520
There you are.

24:36.480 --> 24:41.120
What's this stuff about the announcement
of the hook up auction?

24:43.500 --> 24:45.420
And you're pissed as usual.

24:46.320 --> 24:47.740
I mean it.

24:48.040 --> 24:52.660
Have you gone around telling
people bullshit? -Bullshit?

24:57.280 --> 24:59.820
You have to relax a little.
Have some faith in me.

25:00.200 --> 25:03.420
Faith? Why should I have
faith in you?

25:04.200 --> 25:07.560
You don't care about anyone
but yourself.

25:07.820 --> 25:11.320
I care. 20% of the funds
goes to the refugees.

25:11.320 --> 25:13.720
Because I'm here.

25:14.800 --> 25:17.700
They don't care why
they're getting money.

25:17.980 --> 25:23.760
You don't care about them. Not for real.

25:26.980 --> 25:28.680
I care about you.

25:31.760 --> 25:33.040
For real.

25:36.020 --> 25:38.420
No. You don't.

25:39.060 --> 25:45.460
If you really did you wouldn't have pressured me
to come to the party like this.

25:46.080 --> 25:49.340
You don't have to be here
if you don't want to.

25:49.820 --> 25:54.720
Yes, I do! How else will the
refugees get their money?

25:56.240 --> 26:00.580
The refugees will get their
money anyway. So relax.

26:03.580 --> 26:05.540
Yeah, but eh...

26:06.280 --> 26:11.460
I have to be here and watch Eva.
So she doesn't do something stupid.

26:19.980 --> 26:21.760
How do you think that's going?

26:39.100 --> 26:42.320
I think I have to puke.
-You have to puke?

26:42.820 --> 26:45.440
You have to puke?!
You can't puke here.

26:45.540 --> 26:47.680
Aren't you getting tired of this game soon?

26:49.140 --> 26:50.620
What game?

26:52.940 --> 26:55.000
Pretending as if you don't like me?

26:57.120 --> 27:00.580
That's not a game.
I'm not pretending.

27:03.100 --> 27:05.360
Okay. This is what we'll do.

27:06.320 --> 27:09.040
Look into my eyes.
And tell me you don't like me.

27:17.440 --> 27:19.940
That's the dumbest thing I've heard.

27:26.580 --> 27:27.940
Look at me.

27:33.580 --> 27:36.240
Say you don't like me,
and I'm gone.

27:37.320 --> 27:38.020
I swear.

27:56.300 --> 27:57.940
I don't like you.

28:46.220 --> 28:48.560
You don't have the right
to be pissed at me.

28:55.660 --> 28:57.160
I'm not pissed at you.

28:58.500 --> 29:03.120
I'm just trying to do what's
right here. What you're doing is shit.

29:03.340 --> 29:05.160
As long as you get your way.

29:06.980 --> 29:07.880
Okay.

29:08.220 --> 29:16.160
You're insanely selfish, manipulating,
and self-involved.

29:16.460 --> 29:22.640
And spoiled.
That's why I don't like you.

29:25.160 --> 29:26.560
Was that all?

29:27.360 --> 29:28.580
No!
