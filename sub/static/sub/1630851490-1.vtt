42:56.246 --> 42:59.849
One, two, three,
four, five, six...

42:59.882 --> 43:01.183
Six feet away!

43:01.217 --> 43:02.885
Six feet away!

43:02.918 --> 43:05.121
Dad, can you come over here
and visit?

43:11.460 --> 43:14.397
I don't really have
happy dreams...

43:14.664 --> 43:16.099
Yeah.

43:16.132 --> 43:20.336
I have to fill out
this paperwork for my kids.

43:20.369 --> 43:22.038
They want to medicate them.

43:22.070 --> 43:24.340
I alone am fighting for
the well-being

43:24.373 --> 43:26.876
and the safety and security
of my children.

43:26.909 --> 43:31.380
Then on top of that, I'm also
doing my work for this job

43:31.414 --> 43:36.420
that I have just got,
working with troubled youth.

43:37.052 --> 43:39.388
So the fight continues on.

43:41.356 --> 43:45.795
I started learning how to love
at the age of 22 years old.

43:49.199 --> 43:51.268
Stop!
You don't operate the phone!

43:51.300 --> 43:54.336
Hey, I gave Yay'veontay the task
to operate the phone.

43:54.369 --> 43:56.239
So may you guys
please allow him to do it?

43:56.271 --> 43:58.208
I'm gonna...

43:59.943 --> 44:03.413
Hey, one of you guys
take the phone and go outside.

44:03.445 --> 44:04.480
Alright...

44:04.514 --> 44:05.349
Oww!

44:07.617 --> 44:10.420
You got your shoes on?

44:10.452 --> 44:11.387
Mhm!

44:11.420 --> 44:12.922
Alright.

44:12.956 --> 44:14.858
Go outside, like by the front
door, and let's see

44:14.891 --> 44:16.927
how the reception is
right there.

44:16.960 --> 44:18.427
I'm outside.

44:19.561 --> 44:21.531
Manieepoo!

44:21.965 --> 44:23.934
What's the deal, Mama?

44:24.166 --> 44:25.402
Nothing.

44:25.434 --> 44:28.905
The video works
so much better with you outside.

44:29.405 --> 44:31.974
- Manieepoo?
- Huh?

44:32.007 --> 44:35.611
Hey, Maniee, stay right there
where the reception is good.

44:39.615 --> 44:41.150
Manieepoo?

44:46.489 --> 44:50.092
My three children were separated
in all different foster homes.

44:50.126 --> 44:54.231
My children's mother and myself
went through a hard break-up and

44:54.264 --> 44:57.634
we both could have conducted
ourselves in a better fashion.

44:57.666 --> 44:59.268
And being that we didn't,

44:59.302 --> 45:01.872
it resulted in our children
being taken from our custody

45:01.905 --> 45:05.542
by the Department of Children
and Family Services.

45:08.077 --> 45:10.614
The current pandemic
has not affected

45:10.646 --> 45:13.851
my current arrangements
for visitation.

45:16.219 --> 45:18.088
Where are you?

45:18.121 --> 45:20.923
I'm not too far from you guys.

45:20.956 --> 45:22.592
Oh, can you come?

45:23.159 --> 45:24.427
Hmmm...

45:24.927 --> 45:27.864
If it's okay with your Auntie.

45:29.231 --> 45:31.601
I may be over there
a little later.

45:32.068 --> 45:36.306
I am not able
to come over there today but...

45:36.338 --> 45:38.607
Hey look, but on a more
serious note,

45:38.641 --> 45:40.443
if you can, I really need you
to pay attention

45:40.476 --> 45:42.311
to what I'm about to tell you.

45:42.344 --> 45:44.146
Wasn't there
a shooting over there?

45:44.179 --> 45:46.148
Like yesterday or
the night before last?

45:46.181 --> 45:48.450
If you're outside, right?
And you hear gunshots,

45:48.483 --> 45:50.953
what are you supposed to do?

45:50.987 --> 45:52.588
- Look?
- No...

45:52.621 --> 45:54.390
- Run?
- No.

45:54.891 --> 45:57.961
- In back... under a car...
- No. No. No.

45:57.994 --> 45:59.930
You get down, you prone out.

45:59.963 --> 46:02.265
You get as close to the earth
as you can.

46:02.297 --> 46:04.199
You know why I'm telling
you this, right?

46:04.233 --> 46:07.070
'Cause that dog right there,
that dog.

46:07.436 --> 46:08.538
What?

46:08.570 --> 46:10.273
The dog!

46:10.306 --> 46:13.210
- You don't see that dog?
- I don't want...

46:13.577 --> 46:15.645
Okay, lemme see the dog.

46:26.655 --> 46:28.991
If you had super powers, Mama,

46:29.025 --> 46:31.295
what super powers
would you want?

46:32.094 --> 46:33.495
To fly!

46:33.528 --> 46:34.965
Woo!

46:35.498 --> 46:36.432
There we go!

46:36.465 --> 46:38.367
I wanna be extremely fast...

46:38.400 --> 46:40.536
I had a dream that I...

46:40.570 --> 46:44.074
I chose that I could just
run to dad every...

46:44.574 --> 46:48.378
My visitation with my children
is at least once a week,

46:48.411 --> 46:52.516
for whatever amount of hours
the caretaker allows.

46:53.782 --> 46:55.351
For seven years,

46:55.385 --> 46:59.356
I have been fighting tooth
and nail to regain custody.

46:59.755 --> 47:02.992
I feel like I'm incomplete.

47:03.726 --> 47:07.297
Sometimes, I get so deep into
my depression

47:07.329 --> 47:09.032
that I just wanna be alone,

47:09.065 --> 47:11.067
I don't want to interact
with people.

47:11.099 --> 47:12.668
It's a fight.

47:12.702 --> 47:14.037
Yeah, it's a fight.

47:14.070 --> 47:16.639
You know,
the biggest fight of my life.

47:16.672 --> 47:18.440
Six feet away!

47:18.474 --> 47:20.744
One, two, three,
four, five, six...

47:20.777 --> 47:23.278
Dad, when's the next time
we go to court?

47:23.311 --> 47:25.714
We're supposed
to go to court this month,

47:25.748 --> 47:28.550
but due to
the Covid-19 pandemic,

47:28.583 --> 47:31.620
we was unable to go to court.

47:31.653 --> 47:34.690
So it can be next week,
it can be next month,

47:34.724 --> 47:36.593
or it can be next year.

47:37.059 --> 47:39.429
I wanna be the judge.

47:39.762 --> 47:42.798
So, okay, if you wanna be
the judge, that's magnificent.

47:42.831 --> 47:45.201
Families going through what
we going through,

47:45.233 --> 47:46.436
you can be able
to better assist them

47:46.469 --> 47:48.104
because you went
through it, right?

47:48.137 --> 47:52.442
First I'm gonna work as
a dentist for a little bit then

47:52.474 --> 47:56.045
I'm gonna quit it...
and be a judge.

47:56.079 --> 47:59.082
Well, I feel like
we should discuss that...

47:59.114 --> 48:02.418
- a little bit more...
- Six feet away!

48:02.452 --> 48:04.587
Six feet away.

48:04.619 --> 48:07.156
I dream about my kids, yeah.

48:07.190 --> 48:09.425
And when I dream about my kids,
it's just like...

48:09.458 --> 48:12.261
things as simple as
having a meal together.

48:12.295 --> 48:13.829
You want some?

48:13.862 --> 48:15.464
Yeah, just gimme a bite.

48:17.766 --> 48:19.602
It's pepperoni.

48:20.769 --> 48:22.072
Conversations,

48:22.105 --> 48:23.505
being in the living room,

48:23.539 --> 48:24.841
watching TV...

48:24.873 --> 48:27.676
The things that a lot of
people take for granted.

48:27.710 --> 48:29.778
Those are daydreams.

48:29.811 --> 48:31.780
Those aren't the physical dreams

48:31.813 --> 48:34.149
that I dream
when I lay down at night,

48:34.182 --> 48:35.719
and try to sleep.

48:39.322 --> 48:42.125
I suffer from PTSD.

48:42.157 --> 48:45.295
My dreams is rooted
in the hardships that

48:45.327 --> 48:48.498
God has blessed me
so far to escape.

48:48.864 --> 48:51.100
Being homeless as a child,

48:51.134 --> 48:52.402
being beaten,

48:52.434 --> 48:54.637
being neglected, you know?

48:57.139 --> 48:59.208
Some nights I don't sleep.

49:00.376 --> 49:02.512
Hey, what's going on,
Yay'veontay?

49:02.545 --> 49:04.646
Good, where you at?
Why won't you come?

49:04.679 --> 49:08.550
You guys are my children,
of course I'm gonna be there.

49:08.583 --> 49:09.551
What's up, Dad?

49:09.585 --> 49:11.753
What's going on, brother?

49:16.759 --> 49:18.795
You look real nice
with your glasses.

49:18.827 --> 49:20.295
Why didn't you put
your bow on?

49:20.329 --> 49:22.565
Why didn't you put it
right here?

49:22.597 --> 49:24.333
Like that?

49:24.367 --> 49:26.202
Dang! I forgot about that...

49:26.235 --> 49:27.871
You forgot?
Wait, come here!

49:27.903 --> 49:30.139
Can I take a picture of you?

49:35.143 --> 49:36.846
I'm happy that my children

49:36.878 --> 49:39.715
were finally able to be placed
in the same residence,

49:39.748 --> 49:42.785
and placed in the care
of family members.

49:43.652 --> 49:46.388
We're hopeful that,
on the next court date,

49:46.422 --> 49:48.657
they're gonna liberalize
my visits.

49:48.690 --> 49:50.459
I'll be able to go get my kids,

49:50.492 --> 49:51.760
and spend about
5 hours with them

49:51.793 --> 49:53.395
take 'em wherever
I want to take 'em,

49:53.429 --> 49:56.833
and at the end of that 5 hours,
drop them back off.

49:57.967 --> 49:59.369
Is you crying?

49:59.402 --> 50:00.403
Say no.

50:00.436 --> 50:02.238
- Cause you're a big man?
- Yeah.

50:02.271 --> 50:03.806
Papa, is you a big man?

50:03.838 --> 50:05.875
Yes, y'all is.
Then you got...

50:05.907 --> 50:06.875
Yay'veontay!

50:06.909 --> 50:09.311
Yay'veontay, right there, man!

50:09.878 --> 50:12.382
Say cheese.
Don't cry, okay?

50:15.585 --> 50:17.320
Stop crying.

50:17.652 --> 50:18.887
Wipe your face.

50:18.920 --> 50:20.623
You're a big girl.

50:20.655 --> 50:23.326
Daddy gonna come back
and see you, okay?

50:23.358 --> 50:24.860
Don't cry.

50:25.927 --> 50:27.763
You're gonna be alright.

50:28.130 --> 50:30.799
Sometimes, I'm not capable
of physically

50:30.833 --> 50:32.568
reaching out
and touching my kids,

50:32.601 --> 50:33.902
but spiritually,

50:33.936 --> 50:36.806
we're connected and
they know their father is there.

50:36.838 --> 50:38.875
Periodically,
I dream about my kids,

50:38.907 --> 50:40.376
us flying...

50:41.210 --> 50:45.948
We'll all be together, holding
hands, flying, laughing...

50:45.981 --> 50:49.485
Swimming, without having
to come up for air...

50:49.518 --> 50:52.422
Being able to be free,
and defy the limitations

50:52.454 --> 50:54.590
that the physical put on us.

50:54.623 --> 50:56.792
These dreams bring me peace.

50:57.126 --> 50:59.796
Yeah, peace, peace.

51:02.498 --> 51:05.835
My love, my sunshine, my dear...

52:04.827 --> 52:06.496
<i>Is this recording? No?</i>

52:06.528 --> 52:07.931
<i>Is this recording?</i>

52:09.699 --> 52:11.067
<i>Hi Laura...</i>

52:11.099 --> 52:14.503
<i>So you asked me
to start sending memos about</i>

52:14.536 --> 52:16.939
<i>this ongoing investigation.</i>

52:18.373 --> 52:19.875
<i>Uhmm...</i>

52:19.909 --> 52:20.977
<i>So like this...</i>

52:21.010 --> 52:22.845
<i>We were watching the news about</i>

52:22.878 --> 52:24.847
<i>the spread of
surveillance technology</i>

52:24.880 --> 52:26.648
<i>for Corona tracing.</i>

52:26.681 --> 52:29.718
<i>So, the way that kind
of global viral emergency</i>

52:29.751 --> 52:32.087
<i>is used to roll out
the surveillance projects</i>

52:32.121 --> 52:34.691
<i>in different parts of the world.</i>

52:38.527 --> 52:41.563
<i>One company name
was always there...</i>

52:42.597 --> 52:44.500
<i>NSO Group.</i>

52:44.532 --> 52:46.935
<i>So, we already wanted
for a long time</i>

52:46.969 --> 52:49.806
<i>to start an investigation
on the NSO</i>

52:49.838 --> 52:52.607
<i>because NSO software was used
to target</i>

52:52.641 --> 52:54.811
<i>our colleagues and friends.</i>

52:55.378 --> 52:59.082
<i>We know that you know
what it feels to be surveilled,</i>

52:59.114 --> 53:02.584
<i>that surveillance is not only
a breach of privacy,</i>

53:02.617 --> 53:03.952
<i>that it is violence,</i>

53:03.985 --> 53:06.021
<i>that it does things to you,</i>

53:06.054 --> 53:09.725
<i>that things start to happen
to you in the real world...</i>

53:09.759 --> 53:11.094
<i>And then it spreads across</i>

53:11.126 --> 53:12.961
<i>your network of
friends, colleagues,</i>

53:12.994 --> 53:15.597
<i>and stakeholders or clients...</i>

53:15.630 --> 53:19.101
<i>And that being targeted
feels like terror.</i>

53:58.773 --> 54:01.076
If I'm an organization paying
a lot of money

54:01.110 --> 54:02.812
for each targeting hack,

54:02.844 --> 54:05.080
the right thing is
to target a person

54:05.114 --> 54:07.449
at the center of the network.

54:07.483 --> 54:11.454
Carmen is the head person
of the matrix.

54:11.487 --> 54:14.757
So how can you imagine, Nathan,

54:14.789 --> 54:17.692
a way of visualizing
something like that?

54:17.726 --> 54:19.061
Uhmm...

54:19.094 --> 54:22.597
There is a way to illustrate it
through the events.

54:24.467 --> 54:27.603
Anything that's a sphere
is an attack.

54:27.635 --> 54:29.137
It means that

54:29.170 --> 54:32.107
this person on the timeline
has been directly targeted

54:32.141 --> 54:34.577
by that act of violence.

54:34.876 --> 54:36.913
So, it might be a digital act
of violence

54:36.945 --> 54:38.547
or a physical act of violence,

54:38.581 --> 54:40.817
but it's a direct attack
on that person.

54:42.851 --> 54:45.721
When Carmen was first targeted,

54:45.753 --> 54:47.489
if she clicked on that,

54:47.523 --> 54:49.192
it's quite possible
they gained access

54:49.224 --> 54:50.893
to all the conversations
she was having

54:50.925 --> 54:52.628
with all of the members
of her team.

54:52.661 --> 54:55.097
So, from Carmen, and
they attack everybody else.

54:55.130 --> 54:59.501
And then in 2016, that's when
five subjects raid her office.

55:10.079 --> 55:11.714
Hola Carmen!

55:11.746 --> 55:14.082
I am the lead researcher

55:14.115 --> 55:17.119
on this project
with Forensic Architecture.

55:17.519 --> 55:22.090
We're focusing specifically on
the targeted digital violence of

55:22.123 --> 55:25.760
the Israeli cyber weapons
manufacturer, NSO Group,

55:25.793 --> 55:28.931
and the use of Pegasus
around the world.

55:28.963 --> 55:30.532
You are one of...

55:30.565 --> 55:32.667
the first persons
that was documented

55:32.701 --> 55:34.135
by Citizen Lab as being

55:34.168 --> 55:37.473
targeted using Pegasus.

55:59.094 --> 56:01.597
Can you describe
what you remember

56:01.630 --> 56:03.798
as the first message
you received?

56:03.831 --> 56:05.134
The hacks?

56:59.989 --> 57:03.159
<i>Hi Laura, I hope you're okay...</i>

57:03.192 --> 57:06.161
<i>So last night,
I had horrible dreams.</i>

57:06.195 --> 57:09.065
<i>I dreamt that
I was being interrogated,</i>

57:09.097 --> 57:13.302
<i>and I woke up with extreme
anxiety and in cold sweats,</i>

57:13.335 --> 57:16.237
<i>and the first thought
that came to my mind was,</i>

57:16.271 --> 57:18.673
<i>"Are we making a huge mistake?"</i>

57:18.706 --> 57:20.775
<i>I don't want to get
too paranoid,</i>

57:20.809 --> 57:22.345
<i>but I'm also thinking
at the same time</i>

57:22.378 --> 57:24.713
<i>that we've never had
to come across</i>

57:24.746 --> 57:27.182
<i>a company like the NSO group</i>

57:27.215 --> 57:29.085
<i>They're very lawsuit happy,</i>

57:29.117 --> 57:31.086
<i>they go after people,
they intimidate...</i>

57:31.119 --> 57:33.355
<i>Every single person
we've spoken to so far,</i>

57:33.389 --> 57:36.759
<i>whether they're journalists,
lawyers suing them, researchers,</i>

57:36.791 --> 57:38.994
<i>or people who've been targeted,
they're all telling us</i>

57:39.027 --> 57:41.997
<i>this company tries to
intimidate, to scare,</i>

57:42.030 --> 57:43.231
<i>to make your life hell,</i>

57:43.264 --> 57:45.601
<i>just so that you go away.</i>

58:15.030 --> 58:17.867
As an Arab,
we have interest in

58:17.900 --> 58:20.235
what is going on
in the Arab world.

58:20.268 --> 58:23.271
So for us,
it's like a personal matter

58:23.304 --> 58:25.940
as well as a legal matter.

58:25.974 --> 58:28.443
This is not the first time
that we've been targeted

58:28.476 --> 58:30.011
or that we were
under surveillance

58:30.045 --> 58:31.247
by the Indian state.

58:31.280 --> 58:33.215
A lot of my contacts,
when I told them,

58:33.248 --> 58:34.784
look this is happening to me,

58:34.817 --> 58:37.219
They said, "We always presumed
this would happen to you

58:37.251 --> 58:39.855
"so don't worry,
we all prepared for it.

58:39.887 --> 58:42.424
"You must be doing something
really wonderful

58:42.458 --> 58:44.193
"because
the government's spending

58:44.226 --> 58:46.061
a lot of money on this."

58:47.061 --> 58:48.764
These are the phones.

58:50.798 --> 58:52.168
They're all active?

58:53.034 --> 58:54.103
All active.

58:54.135 --> 58:58.273
In Mexico,
when you study journalism,

58:58.306 --> 59:00.208
you take for granted that

59:00.242 --> 59:02.812
the government is going
to be after you.

59:02.844 --> 59:04.913
And we are the lucky ones

59:04.947 --> 59:07.950
because in so many regions
in Mexico,

59:07.983 --> 59:10.286
they get a bullet,
they don't get a message...

59:10.318 --> 59:11.853
They get a bullet.

59:36.778 --> 59:38.514
I'm not sure we can
make the argument

59:38.547 --> 59:40.282
that what
the NSO is enabling,

59:40.315 --> 59:42.952
in terms of operationalizing
its surveillance

59:42.985 --> 59:44.186
into direct violence,

59:44.219 --> 59:46.456
is new territory, right?

59:47.123 --> 59:50.960
I mean the CIA and NSA
do that all the time.

59:50.992 --> 59:53.429
What I think is new is
that we can see the fingerprints

59:53.461 --> 59:54.896
and we can show it.

59:54.929 --> 59:57.232
I think that that points
to something that

59:57.266 --> 59:59.300
I would say might be
new territory,

59:59.333 --> 01:00:02.538
which is a private company
manufacturing and selling

01:00:02.570 --> 01:00:05.474
nation state-level cyberweapons.

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:15.784
There is something
of a viral logic

01:00:15.818 --> 01:00:18.387
about this form of targeting

01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:22.291
in a way that it spreads
between family members,

01:00:22.324 --> 01:00:26.228
but also the people
that investigate those crimes.

01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:29.498
If we know that X activist
was targeted on this date

01:00:29.530 --> 01:00:31.333
and then immediately
following that,

01:00:31.365 --> 01:00:33.369
something physical happened...

01:00:33.402 --> 01:00:35.371
Like if one of those threads
could be drawn

01:00:35.403 --> 01:00:36.905
through the database.

01:00:36.938 --> 01:00:40.009
This is the underlying logic
of this investigation...

01:00:40.041 --> 01:00:43.244
Digital vs. physical violence.
So let's start with that.

01:00:43.277 --> 01:00:45.413
Look at the same pattern,

01:00:45.447 --> 01:00:49.318
across in when and how
does it happen in Mexico,

01:00:49.351 --> 01:00:53.823
when and how does this kind of
relation happen in the UAE,

01:00:53.856 --> 01:00:56.225
when it happens in Rwanda,
when it happens in India,

01:00:56.257 --> 01:00:58.059
if you have data about that,

01:00:58.092 --> 01:01:00.528
and find a way to move

01:01:00.561 --> 01:01:03.298
between one field of operation
to the other.

01:01:03.699 --> 01:01:07.135
All the information is there,
but this is now

01:01:07.168 --> 01:01:09.170
the mobilization of the data.

01:01:09.204 --> 01:01:11.273
It is not now
about simply plotting

01:01:11.306 --> 01:01:13.375
because this material
is being plotted,

01:01:13.407 --> 01:01:16.010
political events are there
plotted on a timeline,

01:01:16.043 --> 01:01:18.047
there are physical events...

01:01:18.079 --> 01:01:20.882
It's now you have
all the strings,

01:01:20.916 --> 01:01:23.318
and now you start playing
music on them.

01:01:23.351 --> 01:01:25.954
You go like, "I'm just gonna
use these notes."

01:01:25.987 --> 01:01:28.523
Ta, ta, ta, ta...
is targeting.

01:01:31.626 --> 01:01:33.962
I'm gonna zoom in a little.

01:01:33.996 --> 01:01:35.931
So if we go into
the front view,

01:01:35.963 --> 01:01:38.534
here we have
the field of Mexico...

01:01:38.867 --> 01:01:42.505
So, from on top,
it appears just as a line...

01:01:44.172 --> 01:01:47.543
collapsed into a single field.
So this is Mexico.

01:01:47.909 --> 01:01:51.246
But then if we view it
from the side,

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:54.917
we see all of the targets, all
the people who've been targeted

01:01:54.949 --> 01:01:58.019
by NSO software inside Mexico.

01:01:58.052 --> 01:02:00.455
So when we're seeing it
in 3D, for example,

01:02:00.489 --> 01:02:05.126
we can see that some targets are
operating in multiple fields,

01:02:05.159 --> 01:02:08.396
for example,
Mazen and Citizen Lab operate

01:02:08.429 --> 01:02:11.532
in Mexico, Saudi Arabia and UAE.

01:02:11.565 --> 01:02:15.570
Our current database includes
every event that we have

01:02:15.603 --> 01:02:18.940
which is an attack that's been
performed using NSO software.

01:02:18.974 --> 01:02:20.676
And that database lists
all the people

01:02:20.708 --> 01:02:22.911
that have been targeted by

01:02:22.945 --> 01:02:25.114
the state that
has bought NSO software

01:02:25.146 --> 01:02:27.282
and is doing the targeting.

01:02:33.722 --> 01:02:36.225
<i>I remember the moment
when the project</i>

01:02:36.257 --> 01:02:38.293
<i>gained urgency in my mind,</i>

01:02:38.327 --> 01:02:40.629
<i>and that was with Fleming.</i>

01:02:40.661 --> 01:02:45.934
<i>This is NSO's first
so-called "civilian product."</i>

01:02:45.967 --> 01:02:49.538
<i>It was described as a contact
tracing tool to monitor both</i>

01:02:49.570 --> 01:02:52.074
<i>those who had caught Covid-19,</i>

01:02:52.106 --> 01:02:56.210
<i>but also those that
they had come into contact with.</i>

01:02:56.244 --> 01:03:00.516
<i>It was reported that Fleming
had been marketed to</i>

01:03:00.548 --> 01:03:03.985
<i>dozens of health ministries
around the world.</i>

01:03:05.619 --> 01:03:08.324
<i>So, it was a set of alarm bells
in my mind</i>

01:03:08.356 --> 01:03:11.157
<i>that the same
cyber weapons manufacturer</i>

01:03:11.159 --> 01:03:13.461
<i>that had targeted
former collaborators</i>

01:03:13.494 --> 01:03:14.730
<i>of Forensic Architecture,</i>

01:03:14.762 --> 01:03:18.000
<i>targeted my own personal friends
and colleagues,</i>

01:03:18.032 --> 01:03:20.601
<i>and these are all
human rights activists,</i>

01:03:20.635 --> 01:03:23.539
<i>researchers, lawyers,
journalists...</i>

01:03:23.572 --> 01:03:27.409
<i>This same company is now
offering its services</i>

01:03:27.442 --> 01:03:31.512
<i>to deal with
private health details.</i>

01:03:34.516 --> 01:03:38.721
When I first started working
on these cases,

01:03:39.054 --> 01:03:41.757
it was clear that

01:03:41.789 --> 01:03:44.559
we're dealing
with a company that

01:03:44.592 --> 01:03:47.596
does not have a lot of respect
for human rights.

01:03:47.628 --> 01:03:51.032
Also if you look at
the reporting about the company,

01:03:51.065 --> 01:03:52.634
the value of the company,

01:03:52.666 --> 01:03:54.569
the money that's involved,

01:03:54.603 --> 01:03:56.637
we're talking about
hundreds of millions of dollars.

01:03:56.670 --> 01:03:58.773
Of course a lot of
the people in Mexico

01:03:58.806 --> 01:04:01.676
that you represent
have lost their jobs,

01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:04.612
they've had
their offices broken into,

01:04:04.646 --> 01:04:06.782
they've had
their partners killed.

01:04:06.815 --> 01:04:11.086
And so the state kills
43 students in Ayotzinapa,

01:04:11.119 --> 01:04:13.622
people report on it,
they get hacked,

01:04:13.655 --> 01:04:16.725
then their lawyers get targeted,
and so on.

01:04:16.757 --> 01:04:19.327
And so a lot of
what we're seeing

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:21.429
along the way is
this escalation,

01:04:21.463 --> 01:04:24.099
this rise in the way
that people are targeted.

01:04:24.132 --> 01:04:26.501
Not only they would gather
information,

01:04:26.534 --> 01:04:29.105
but also they can
send messages.

01:04:29.505 --> 01:04:35.577
So they can start managing
your relationship with people

01:04:35.610 --> 01:04:39.213
by sending them
all kind of information,

01:04:39.246 --> 01:04:42.116
messages that supposedly
come from you.

01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:47.322
It's like somebody's sitting
in your mind.

01:04:51.592 --> 01:04:54.596
<i>The NSO group stands for
the 3 persons</i>

01:04:54.628 --> 01:04:57.331
<i>who founded the company in 2010.</i>

01:04:57.364 --> 01:05:00.468
<i>Shalev Hulio is
the S in NSO and</i>

01:05:00.501 --> 01:05:02.603
<i>perhaps the more well-known
of the three.</i>

01:05:02.637 --> 01:05:05.441
<i>He's not exactly
a technical wizard.</i>

01:05:05.474 --> 01:05:08.376
<i>He did not serve in Unit 8200,</i>

01:05:08.409 --> 01:05:11.312
<i>which is the intelligence unit
in the Israeli Army.</i>

01:05:11.346 --> 01:05:13.347
<i>But Shalev Hulio did serve
in the Israeli Army,</i>

01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:14.583
<i>and as a commander,</i>

01:05:14.615 --> 01:05:16.652
<i>he was involved
in a series of operations</i>

01:05:16.684 --> 01:05:18.519
<i>in the occupied West Bank.</i>

01:05:18.552 --> 01:05:20.822
<i>One of his operations was
during the height</i>

01:05:20.856 --> 01:05:23.492
<i>of the Second Intifada in 2002,</i>

01:05:23.525 --> 01:05:26.394
<i>which is
Operation Defensive Shield.</i>

01:05:26.427 --> 01:05:29.097
<i>This extremely destructive
operation</i>

01:05:29.130 --> 01:05:31.432
<i>involved sending soldiers</i>

01:05:31.465 --> 01:05:34.869
<i>straight through the walls
of Palestinian homes, so</i>

01:05:34.902 --> 01:05:36.605
<i>instead of fighting their way</i>

01:05:36.637 --> 01:05:38.306
<i>through the alleyways
of the camp,</i>

01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:41.143
<i>Israeli soldiers
would smash their way</i>

01:05:41.175 --> 01:05:43.545
<i>through civilian homes
to clear a path,</i>

01:05:43.577 --> 01:05:46.681
<i>blasting their way
through the built environment,</i>

01:05:46.715 --> 01:05:50.452
<i>and mobilizing people's homes
against their bodies.</i>

01:05:58.726 --> 01:06:02.431
<i>Do you currently...? Do you hold
a security clearance right now?</i>

01:06:02.463 --> 01:06:05.867
<i>Nope, I've been this
whistleblower guy in the past.</i>

01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:09.370
<i>My interests lie
in helping to get</i>

01:06:09.403 --> 01:06:11.806
<i>whatever should be
public, public.</i>

01:06:12.474 --> 01:06:15.144
<i>So you can think of me as a</i>

01:06:15.177 --> 01:06:18.280
<i>solutions executive
with a software company.</i>

01:06:18.313 --> 01:06:21.282
<i>What it boiled down to was that
we had access to the networks,</i>

01:06:21.315 --> 01:06:23.651
<i>and NSO was looking for access.</i>

01:06:23.684 --> 01:06:25.853
<i>So the access
to the network would be...</i>

01:06:25.887 --> 01:06:28.690
<i>They would get a global title.</i>

01:06:28.722 --> 01:06:30.592
<i>They would have a piece
of software into it</i>

01:06:30.625 --> 01:06:31.659
<i>that would have access</i>

01:06:31.693 --> 01:06:33.829
<i>to the live operator network.</i>

01:06:34.195 --> 01:06:35.898
<i>This was a conference call.</i>

01:06:35.931 --> 01:06:39.367
<i>They were very hesitant
to share their names.</i>

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:41.702
<i>I took their names
and email addresses</i>

01:06:41.735 --> 01:06:44.373
<i>just in the event
something bad were to happen.</i>

01:06:44.672 --> 01:06:47.241
<i>So I met with
all these people...</i>

01:06:47.275 --> 01:06:50.311
<i>Omri, Eddy Shalev,
Eran Gorev...</i>

01:06:51.445 --> 01:06:52.714
Wow.

01:06:53.047 --> 01:06:56.284
<i>There's a tremendous amount
of value in that,</i>

01:06:56.318 --> 01:06:59.488
<i>to get access to
operator signaling networks.</i>

01:06:59.521 --> 01:07:01.524
<i>It made me very uncomfortable.</i>

01:07:02.757 --> 01:07:06.228
I did reach out to the FBI,
multiple times...

01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:08.931
Do you know what happened
with that information?

01:07:08.963 --> 01:07:12.668
I don't know,
it was very silent after that.

01:07:13.501 --> 01:07:16.737
It's gonna take
a second to process this.

01:07:16.771 --> 01:07:18.539
And are you in a position

01:07:18.572 --> 01:07:20.641
where you could provide
access globally

01:07:20.675 --> 01:07:23.612
or just in the US
or in what countries?

01:07:24.679 --> 01:07:25.681
<i>Globally.</i>

01:07:48.836 --> 01:07:50.706
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

01:07:50.739 --> 01:07:53.375
<i>So I'm having
all these flashbacks.</i>

01:07:53.407 --> 01:07:55.844
<i>The first time
Snowden contacted me,</i>

01:07:55.876 --> 01:07:58.947
<i>I was sitting here,
I was in this room.</i>

01:08:00.481 --> 01:08:03.252
<i>There was a kind of demarcation</i>

01:08:03.284 --> 01:08:06.520
<i>of my life, before and after.</i>

01:08:06.554 --> 01:08:07.855
<i>Those I could trust,</i>

01:08:07.889 --> 01:08:10.359
<i>and then people
who enter my life after,</i>

01:08:10.391 --> 01:08:12.961
<i>who are always
in question, right?</i>

01:08:12.993 --> 01:08:14.496
<i>Uhmm...</i>

01:08:14.529 --> 01:08:16.665
<i>And even the people
you knew before</i>

01:08:16.698 --> 01:08:18.600
<i>can always be flipped.</i>

01:08:21.636 --> 01:08:22.971
<i>And so...</i>

01:08:23.837 --> 01:08:27.009
<i>Listening to people
tell this story</i>

01:08:27.042 --> 01:08:29.411
<i>about this kind
of surveillance...</i>

01:08:29.444 --> 01:08:32.747
<i>It just hits home, right?
It's super unnerving.</i>

01:08:37.984 --> 01:08:40.720
<i>I escaped
from my country under</i>

01:08:40.755 --> 01:08:43.292
<i>the risk of being arrested.</i>

01:08:43.957 --> 01:08:48.662
<i>The field that I'm focusing on,
it's a very sensitive field.</i>

01:08:48.697 --> 01:08:54.734
<i>I'm trying to record
the violations of human rights,</i>

01:08:54.769 --> 01:08:57.971
<i>how they treat
prisoners, detainees,</i>

01:08:58.006 --> 01:09:00.008
<i>if they were tortured...</i>

01:09:00.041 --> 01:09:03.743
<i>And my father,
he is one of the detainees so</i>

01:09:03.778 --> 01:09:07.849
<i>I want to speak about him,
and raise his case.</i>

01:09:07.881 --> 01:09:11.519
<i>And I'm his daughter,
I have to do something.</i>

01:09:11.551 --> 01:09:12.854
I have to tell you,

01:09:12.886 --> 01:09:15.323
as you're talking
I'm trying to...

01:09:15.356 --> 01:09:17.826
Laura has definitely
her experiences

01:09:17.859 --> 01:09:20.796
with being
targeted and surveilled.

01:09:20.828 --> 01:09:25.599
My experiences
with state violence are...

01:09:25.631 --> 01:09:28.069
have so far been more physical.

01:09:28.103 --> 01:09:31.340
In my family,
we left Iran when we were young,

01:09:31.372 --> 01:09:34.608
and I'm just thinking that
we left for political reasons,

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:36.778
my parents were both
political prisoners,

01:09:36.810 --> 01:09:39.680
and when we came here,
we continued our politics...

01:09:39.712 --> 01:09:41.716
We would go
to protest every week

01:09:41.750 --> 01:09:44.551
with other Iranian, Afghan...

01:09:44.586 --> 01:09:47.421
Kurdish refugees.

01:09:47.453 --> 01:09:48.988
My mother was part of the

01:09:49.023 --> 01:09:51.658
International Federation
of Iranian Refugees,

01:09:51.693 --> 01:09:55.063
and she did it here because
she was away from Iran.

01:09:55.095 --> 01:09:57.565
If she were to do that today,

01:09:57.599 --> 01:09:59.900
the Islamic Republic
would be able to

01:09:59.934 --> 01:10:03.070
reach out and touch her,
so to speak,

01:10:03.104 --> 01:10:05.474
in the way that
your home government

01:10:05.506 --> 01:10:07.541
is reaching out
and touching you.

01:10:07.574 --> 01:10:12.447
It's a completely different
ball game for activists,

01:10:12.479 --> 01:10:16.351
and especially activists
coming from places where...

01:10:17.286 --> 01:10:21.489
There is much more
of a physical cost in resisting.

01:11:03.664 --> 01:11:05.533
The link
between digital violence

01:11:05.567 --> 01:11:06.902
and physical violence

01:11:06.935 --> 01:11:09.571
becomes the most clear
when we look at the cases

01:11:09.604 --> 01:11:11.507
from Saudi Arabia.

01:11:18.846 --> 01:11:20.849
He's writing articles,
he's doing columns,

01:11:20.881 --> 01:11:22.116
he's giving talks.

01:11:22.149 --> 01:11:25.453
Then Omar Abdulazziz
and Khashoggi communicate,

01:11:25.487 --> 01:11:26.788
and right after that,

01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:28.789
Abdulazziz gets
targeted digitally.

01:11:28.823 --> 01:11:32.160
They communicated almost
on a daily basis.

01:11:32.193 --> 01:11:34.930
That means that
all the messages

01:11:34.962 --> 01:11:37.698
that they exchanged were there
to be hacked

01:11:37.731 --> 01:11:40.502
because they were all saved
on the WhatsApp account.

01:11:40.534 --> 01:11:44.872
That was a treasure that the
government of Saudi Arabia found

01:11:44.905 --> 01:11:49.610
because they just discovered
the nature of the relationship

01:11:50.645 --> 01:11:53.615
between two big dissidents.

01:11:55.149 --> 01:11:57.486
One month before
they killed him,

01:11:57.519 --> 01:12:00.789
he sent me a private message
on Twitter

01:12:01.456 --> 01:12:04.827
when I was attacked by
Saudi bots and trolls.

01:12:05.493 --> 01:12:08.929
He told me, "Ghada, block them,

01:12:08.962 --> 01:12:11.832
"ignore them,
and don't get upset.

01:12:11.865 --> 01:12:14.002
"Just block them like I do."

01:12:16.570 --> 01:12:19.173
And every day,
the more we discovered

01:12:19.207 --> 01:12:21.576
what happened to him
and how he was...

01:12:21.609 --> 01:12:24.846
how he went in,
how they told him to sit down,

01:12:24.878 --> 01:12:27.248
how they came with the saw,

01:12:27.282 --> 01:12:30.752
how... when they started to...

01:12:35.256 --> 01:12:39.094
When he couldn't breathe,
and then, you know, I was...

01:12:39.793 --> 01:12:43.164
The details, you know,
it was so...

01:12:43.698 --> 01:12:48.170
I don't know how to describe
it actually, it's a nightmare.

01:12:51.338 --> 01:12:55.143
My heart starts beating
and I say, "God, please...

01:12:55.542 --> 01:12:59.046
"Let it be quickly,
let me read something

01:12:59.079 --> 01:13:00.881
"that says he didn't suffer."

01:13:00.914 --> 01:13:04.719
He didn't have time to realize
that he was killed

01:13:04.752 --> 01:13:08.724
by his own government,
by his own people.

01:13:14.729 --> 01:13:19.067
<i>This assassination was empowered
with Israeli software,</i>

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:22.337
<i>and since then,
Saudi Arabia hasn't paid a price</i>

01:13:22.369 --> 01:13:25.073
<i>because of its alliances
with America,</i>

01:13:25.105 --> 01:13:28.076
<i>its investments in Europe,
and so on.</i>

01:13:28.109 --> 01:13:33.014
<i>So it's really
the dispensability of our lives.</i>

01:13:33.046 --> 01:13:35.783
<i>That's something
that became very clear.</i>

01:14:00.707 --> 01:14:02.676
<i>Officially on the record,</i>

01:14:02.710 --> 01:14:06.146
<i>NSO isn't allowed
to operate in the United States.</i>

01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:09.117
<i>But it's attempted
to enter American markets</i>

01:14:09.149 --> 01:14:11.118
<i>for the sale
of its hacking software</i>

01:14:11.152 --> 01:14:13.989
<i>at least a couple of times
that we know about.</i>

01:14:14.021 --> 01:14:17.859
<i>In 2016, they reached out to the
San Diego Police Department</i>

01:14:17.891 --> 01:14:21.028
<i>to sell a version of Pegasus
called Phantom.</i>

01:14:43.016 --> 01:14:47.021
<i>The brochure for Phantom boasts
that it can intercept calls,</i>

01:14:47.055 --> 01:14:48.823
<i>do location tracking,</i>

01:14:48.855 --> 01:14:50.658
<i>access a person's messages,</i>

01:14:50.692 --> 01:14:52.793
<i>their browsing history,
their social networks,</i>

01:14:52.827 --> 01:14:54.329
<i>their contact lists.</i>

01:14:54.362 --> 01:14:57.699
<i>So, we now know there is
an appetite from the U.S. police</i>

01:14:57.731 --> 01:14:59.768
<i>for these kinds of tools.</i>

01:15:00.368 --> 01:15:02.337
<i>But in the context
of a pandemic,</i>

01:15:02.369 --> 01:15:04.972
<i>where we are seeing
rising inequality,</i>

01:15:05.006 --> 01:15:08.076
<i>in a context where communities
are protesting en masse</i>

01:15:08.109 --> 01:15:09.811
<i>against racialized policing,</i>

01:15:09.844 --> 01:15:11.913
<i>it's extremely fucking scary</i>

01:15:11.945 --> 01:15:14.215
<i>to think of
what incredible damage</i>

01:15:14.247 --> 01:15:16.784
<i>tools like Pegasus and Phantom</i>

01:15:16.818 --> 01:15:19.887
<i>can do in the hands
of law enforcement.</i>

01:33:37.884 --> 01:33:39.420
<i>Dear Clyde,</i>

01:33:39.787 --> 01:33:42.122
<i>Your brother didn't make it.</i>

01:33:42.154 --> 01:33:44.291
<i>I don't have all the details,</i>

01:33:44.323 --> 01:33:47.226
<i>but I wanted you to hear it
from me first.</i>

01:33:47.260 --> 01:33:49.496
<i>The Lord's been
looking out for me,</i>

01:33:49.529 --> 01:33:51.932
<i>and I guess He saw it fit
to let me know.</i>

01:33:51.965 --> 01:33:56.302
<i>He's called my sweet boy,
your brother, to His side.</i>

01:33:56.336 --> 01:33:58.438
<i>As you know,
he was doing poorly,</i>

01:33:58.470 --> 01:34:00.306
<i>but I'd hoped
he'd hang in there until</i>

01:34:00.340 --> 01:34:02.208
<i>I made it back to fetch him.</i>

01:34:02.242 --> 01:34:04.845
<i>I guess it wasn't meant to be.</i>

01:34:04.877 --> 01:34:06.445
<i>I'll be...</i>

01:34:20.393 --> 01:34:22.296
<i>I'll be hitting the road
in the morning</i>

01:34:22.328 --> 01:34:24.297
<i>to see him one last time</i>

01:34:24.331 --> 01:34:25.932
<i>before they bury him.</i>

01:34:30.002 --> 01:34:33.072
<i>I will let you know
what I find out.</i>

01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:35.476
<i>Love, Dad.</i>

01:34:40.881 --> 01:34:42.249
<i>Dear Clyde,</i>

01:34:43.216 --> 01:34:45.386
<i>I saw your brother today.</i>

01:34:45.685 --> 01:34:47.887
<i>They had him set up
in the church,</i>

01:34:47.921 --> 01:34:50.090
<i>him and all the rest
of the dead.</i>

01:34:50.590 --> 01:34:54.094
<i>They wouldn't let me through
the door for fear of catching it</i>

01:34:54.127 --> 01:34:57.298
<i>but I could see him
from the threshold.</i>

01:34:58.230 --> 01:35:00.099
<i>So tiny.</i>

01:35:00.934 --> 01:35:03.436
<i>Just like he always was.</i>

01:35:05.070 --> 01:35:08.041
<i>They didn't tell me
they were Presbyterians.</i>

01:35:08.341 --> 01:35:11.143
<i>I don't know
how I feel about that.</i>

01:35:11.176 --> 01:35:13.279
<i>I don't know how I feel about
them being the ones</i>

01:35:13.313 --> 01:35:15.015
<i>to bury him neither.</i>

01:35:15.047 --> 01:35:16.916
<i>But they say they can't release
any of them bodies</i>

01:35:16.949 --> 01:35:18.452
<i>that don't have kin,</i>

01:35:18.484 --> 01:35:21.954
<i>be they Baptists, or Catholic
or Buddhists even.</i>

01:35:23.489 --> 01:35:25.626
<i>Those are the rules.</i>

01:35:27.627 --> 01:35:30.431
<i>It was strange being back
in a church.</i>

01:35:31.297 --> 01:35:33.500
<i>I didn't feel unwelcome.</i>

01:35:33.533 --> 01:35:36.103
<i>Nor did they cast
an untowards eye at me</i>

01:35:36.136 --> 01:35:37.938
<i>when they heard my name.</i>

01:35:37.970 --> 01:35:40.373
<i>Maybe they don't know who I am.</i>

01:35:40.407 --> 01:35:42.909
<i>Wouldn't that be something?</i>

01:35:43.710 --> 01:35:45.979
<i>Or maybe
they're just being kind.</i>

01:35:49.716 --> 01:35:52.286
<i>I haven't led the best life...</i>

01:35:52.719 --> 01:35:55.055
<i>I know you know this,</i>

01:35:55.087 --> 01:35:58.358
<i>but I hope some day
we can talk about it.</i>

01:35:59.158 --> 01:36:02.695
<i>I hope you can find it
in your heart to forgive me.</i>

01:36:02.729 --> 01:36:06.367
<i>Or, if not that,
then to understand me.</i>

01:36:06.966 --> 01:36:11.070
<i>And think of me with something
that isn't disappointment.</i>

01:36:13.539 --> 01:36:15.708
<i>A fellow just walked
through here with his face</i>

01:36:15.742 --> 01:36:17.476
<i>all cut to pieces.</i>

01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:20.079
<i>I wonder what his story is.</i>

01:36:20.546 --> 01:36:22.548
<i>I look at the world
sometimes and</i>

01:36:22.582 --> 01:36:25.953
<i>think it a wonder
that I still recognize it.</i>

01:36:27.186 --> 01:36:30.222
<i>I wonder if I'd recognize you.</i>

01:36:31.423 --> 01:36:33.726
<i>I would call you
if I had your number.</i>

01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:35.162
<i>But...</i>

01:36:35.194 --> 01:36:38.498
<i>Long silences are
best endured in person.</i>

01:36:38.899 --> 01:36:42.469
<i>And I imagine, you and I,
we'd have plenty of those.</i>

01:36:42.969 --> 01:36:46.506
<i>If you want to write,
you can do so in care of</i>

01:36:46.538 --> 01:36:49.208
<i>the St. James
Presbyterian Church...</i>

01:36:49.242 --> 01:36:51.043
<i>in Mildred.</i>

01:36:51.077 --> 01:36:52.612
<i>That's where your brother is.</i>

01:36:52.645 --> 01:36:55.315
<i>And that's where
you'll be able to find me,</i>

01:36:55.347 --> 01:36:57.717
<i>at least until
he's good and buried.</i>

01:36:59.386 --> 01:37:01.455
<i>Please do write.</i>

01:37:01.488 --> 01:37:03.023
<i>Let me know you got this.</i>

01:37:03.055 --> 01:37:06.158
<i>Please leave your message...</i>

01:37:06.192 --> 01:37:08.494
<i>Love, Dad.</i>

01:37:14.801 --> 01:37:17.337
<i>Clyde, I took him.</i>

01:37:21.207 --> 01:37:23.276
<i>I couldn't let them do it.</i>

01:37:23.309 --> 01:37:25.145
<i>It just wasn't right.</i>

01:37:25.578 --> 01:37:27.614
<i>I didn't make a fuss about it.</i>

01:37:27.646 --> 01:37:30.350
<i>I stole into the rectory
at night,</i>

01:37:30.382 --> 01:37:32.586
<i>took his body in my arms,</i>

01:37:32.886 --> 01:37:35.322
<i>and bore him out of there.</i>

01:37:35.354 --> 01:37:37.690
<i>I was going to drive him
back to Texas because</i>

01:37:37.724 --> 01:37:40.260
<i>I wanted to bury him
next to your Ma.</i>

01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:43.329
<i>But before I even got
to the border,</i>

01:37:43.363 --> 01:37:46.432
<i>that poor boy
started to turn foul.</i>

01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:51.505
<i>I wrapped him in his sheet
and found a good spot for him...</i>

01:37:52.372 --> 01:37:54.375
<i>where he'd be safe.</i>

01:37:55.141 --> 01:37:59.445
<i>It's too late for me now,
but I got this notion that,</i>

01:37:59.479 --> 01:38:01.782
<i>you might finish what I started.</i>

01:38:02.414 --> 01:38:05.418
<i>It wouldn't be hard to find him
if you knew where to look,</i>

01:38:05.452 --> 01:38:07.654
<i>so I drew you this map.</i>

01:38:07.686 --> 01:38:10.157
<i>Take the highway
west out of Dallas,</i>

01:38:10.189 --> 01:38:12.158
<i>until you get to Neta Road.</i>

01:38:12.192 --> 01:38:13.393
<i>Go north.</i>

01:38:13.426 --> 01:38:15.462
<i>When you get to the church
on your left,</i>

01:38:15.494 --> 01:38:18.297
<i>look for the old wagon path
on the right.</i>

01:38:18.331 --> 01:38:20.766
<i>And take that until
you get to the river.</i>

01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:23.270
<i>Stop when you get
to the end of it.</i>

01:38:23.302 --> 01:38:25.204
<i>Thirteen paces from the river,</i>

01:38:25.238 --> 01:38:29.142
<i>between the two tallest elms
is where I buried him.</i>

01:38:29.175 --> 01:38:32.645
<i>Deep enough that
the coyotes won't find him.</i>

01:38:32.679 --> 01:38:36.416
<i>But not so deep that
you'll have to dig for long.</i>

01:38:39.219 --> 01:38:40.686
<i>If you were to fetch him,</i>

01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:43.490
<i>and take him back
to where he belongs,</i>

01:38:44.023 --> 01:38:46.159
<i>I could rest easy.</i>

01:38:46.192 --> 01:38:49.362
<i>I could say I've done
all I need to do in this world.</i>

01:38:49.395 --> 01:38:51.598
<i>But don't do it for me.</i>

01:38:52.064 --> 01:38:54.400
<i>He loved you so.</i>

01:38:55.534 --> 01:38:57.636
<i>And even now,</i>

01:38:57.670 --> 01:38:59.672
<i>under all that dirt,</i>

01:39:00.506 --> 01:39:03.342
<i>I know he doesn't want
to be alone.</i>

01:39:05.478 --> 01:39:08.481
<i>I trust these letters
are making their way to you.</i>

01:39:08.814 --> 01:39:11.884
<i>I trust you've been hearing
what people say about me, too.</i>

01:39:11.917 --> 01:39:15.421
<i>But I hope you know
there's more to me than that.</i>

01:39:15.721 --> 01:39:19.725
<i>I think back often to the
last time we were all together.</i>

01:39:19.759 --> 01:39:22.529
<i>You and me and your brother.</i>

01:39:22.828 --> 01:39:24.630
<i>And your Ma...</i>

01:39:24.663 --> 01:39:27.533
<i>in that little house in Medford.</i>

01:39:28.534 --> 01:39:33.340
<i>Even back then,
I was failing every step I took.</i>

01:39:34.573 --> 01:39:38.111
<i>But with you two,
I got things right.</i>

01:39:39.578 --> 01:39:40.880
<i>Clyde.</i>

01:39:41.247 --> 01:39:43.483
<i>I won't write again.</i>

01:39:44.617 --> 01:39:46.753
<i>But know that I love you.</i>

01:39:47.654 --> 01:39:49.590
<i>I surely do.</i>

01:41:29.622 --> 01:41:31.858
<i>Dear Clyde...</i>

01:41:33.893 --> 01:41:37.230
<i>Daddy said you'd be coming.</i>

01:41:39.564 --> 01:41:42.668
<i>He said you'd be coming
to get me.</i>

01:41:43.903 --> 01:41:46.472
<i>I can hear you digging.</i>

01:41:47.873 --> 01:41:50.909
<i>I can hear you getting closer.</i>

01:41:50.943 --> 01:41:52.279
<i>And...</i>

01:41:52.679 --> 01:41:55.582
<i>I wish I could tell you to stop.</i>

01:41:58.551 --> 01:42:01.755
<i>I wish I could tell you
I'm happy.</i>

01:42:01.787 --> 01:42:04.857
<i>And that I just want
to go on resting.</i>

01:42:06.725 --> 01:42:09.295
<i>But I guess I can't.</i>

01:42:10.896 --> 01:42:13.399
<i>'Cause there you are.</i>

01:42:17.904 --> 01:42:19.940
<i>And I don't know...</i>

01:42:22.574 --> 01:42:25.345
<i>You look different
than I remember.</i>

01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:31.484
<i>I wonder what happened to you.</i>

01:42:35.454 --> 01:42:38.658
<i>I wonder
what the world looks like now.</i>

01:42:46.399 --> 01:42:48.868
<i>I guess you'll tell me
what's changed,</i>

01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:51.505
<i>and what I missed out on.</i>

01:42:53.538 --> 01:42:56.376
<i>I didn't much like things
the way they were</i>

01:42:56.408 --> 01:42:58.478
<i>when Daddy was around.</i>

01:42:58.511 --> 01:43:00.847
<i>But maybe that was
because of him.</i>

01:43:06.652 --> 01:43:09.823
<i>Or maybe
that was just everyone.</i>

01:43:14.025 --> 01:43:16.528
<i>All of the people I thought
were good</i>

01:43:16.561 --> 01:43:18.698
<i>turned out to be bad.</i>

01:43:19.198 --> 01:43:21.867
<i>And I just want to sleep...</i>

01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:24.770
<i>so that I wouldn't have
to see them.</i>

01:43:26.005 --> 01:43:29.109
<i>Except,
I remember this one lady...</i>

01:43:29.509 --> 01:43:33.479
<i>She would take me to the window
and let me look out.</i>

01:43:33.512 --> 01:43:35.948
<i>And there were birds
in the sky.</i>

01:43:36.248 --> 01:43:38.784
<i>And even though
it hurt so bad,</i>

01:43:38.818 --> 01:43:40.954
<i>she would look at me and say,</i>

01:43:40.987 --> 01:43:44.591
<i>"Well, at least
it's a beautiful day."</i>

01:43:45.725 --> 01:43:48.495
<i>"At least
it's a beautiful day."</i>

01:43:48.927 --> 01:43:51.064
<i>But I don't know if it was.</i>

01:43:52.131 --> 01:43:54.768
<i>I don't know if it ever was.</i>

01:43:55.167 --> 01:43:58.572
<i>I don't know
if it ever will be again.</i>

01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:02.675
<i>Will it?</i>

01:44:08.847 --> 01:44:12.851
<i>But she would go on
smiling all the same.</i>

01:44:12.885 --> 01:44:16.655
<i>And we'd sit and look
out the window.</i>

01:44:16.956 --> 01:44:19.426
<i>And watch it get dark.</i>

01:56:16.769 --> 01:56:21.769
