02:06.505 --> 02:08.370
Hot water, please.

02:11.476 --> 02:13.028
Excuse me?

02:15.330 --> 02:17.606
He said car is closed.

02:31.530 --> 02:33.235
He'll get for you.

02:34.332 --> 02:36.239
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

02:37.740 --> 02:39.047
American?

02:39.203 --> 02:40.552
Guilty.

02:48.480 --> 02:52.810
- First time to Turkey?
- No, no, no.

02:55.073 --> 02:57.921
Been here...

02:58.313 --> 03:00.209
long time ago.

03:00.492 --> 03:03.021
- Different life.
- Mmm.

03:04.122 --> 03:06.419
- Now you come back.
- Yes.

03:07.122 --> 03:08.992
Looking for something.

03:17.442 --> 03:20.414
My brother say,

03:20.471 --> 03:23.916
you can find whatever
you wish in Turkey.

03:24.005 --> 03:25.692
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

03:25.749 --> 03:29.257
How 'bout a man who
kidnapped his own daughter

03:29.286 --> 03:32.581
and took her away
from her American mother?

03:34.459 --> 03:38.089
An abusive man,
so not a real man.

03:38.167 --> 03:40.512
No love for the child,
just a...

03:40.537 --> 03:42.025
need to punish his ex-wife.

03:42.050 --> 03:43.729
To take the one
thing away from her

03:43.780 --> 03:46.071
that meant everything to her

03:46.220 --> 03:48.919
with no intention of
returning the child.

03:50.408 --> 03:53.791
Do you think that...
Excuse me.

03:56.287 --> 04:00.350
Do you think I could find that
man in Turkey? Or maybe...

04:00.391 --> 04:02.216
on his way to Turkey?

04:03.236 --> 04:05.246
I uh...

04:06.255 --> 04:08.847
would not be looking
for such a man.

04:10.395 --> 04:12.152
It will be...

04:13.927 --> 04:15.526
dangerous.

04:17.421 --> 04:18.963
For you.

04:20.981 --> 04:23.140
Men like him would think that.

04:23.354 --> 04:25.022
And God as my witness,

04:25.086 --> 04:27.152
I would give him a chance.

04:27.263 --> 04:28.736
To stop.

04:29.830 --> 04:31.677
To reconsider.

04:32.963 --> 04:36.316
To think about the worst thing
that could ever happen to him.

04:36.772 --> 04:38.581
To imagine that.

05:42.857 --> 05:45.534
There are two kinds
of pain in this world.

05:51.392 --> 05:53.736
Pain that hurts.

05:55.351 --> 05:57.670
Pain that alters.

06:45.831 --> 06:46.991
Baby!

06:48.432 --> 06:50.428
Oh, baby!

06:54.007 --> 06:55.219
Mom!

06:55.244 --> 06:56.842
Oh, my baby!

07:00.287 --> 07:01.877
Are you okay?

07:06.181 --> 07:07.253
My baby!

07:07.290 --> 07:10.259
The State Department doesn't
know a thing about it, Grace.

07:10.292 --> 07:11.734
No one does.

07:11.759 --> 07:13.147
Just that 45 minutes ago,

07:13.172 --> 07:16.801
someone delivered your daughter
to the desk downstairs.

07:20.260 --> 07:24.067
Oh, I love you so much!
I love you, I love you!

08:48.346 --> 08:51.783
My favorite driver,
always on time like a trucker!

08:54.527 --> 08:55.841
Samuel!

08:55.898 --> 08:59.762
Ah, Roberto, it's not easy
gettin' in and out here.

08:59.882 --> 09:01.389
- Copy Center?
- Eh?

09:01.438 --> 09:03.733
- Copy Center?
- Yes!

09:04.470 --> 09:05.935
Lift off!

09:21.502 --> 09:23.158
How am I today?

09:26.098 --> 09:27.774
The same, only worse.

09:28.428 --> 09:30.984
Every day, I know less.

09:31.397 --> 09:33.122
Welcome to the club.

09:50.049 --> 09:52.071
Thanks for the lift.

10:05.251 --> 10:07.105
I have a piece of advice:

10:07.160 --> 10:11.048
Always be nice to anybody who
has access to your toothbrush.

10:11.079 --> 10:12.258
Hm.

10:17.004 --> 10:18.125
Okay.

10:18.168 --> 10:19.986
Thank you for this
interview and opportunity.

10:20.476 --> 10:22.543
Now, as you can see
from my resume...

10:23.012 --> 10:24.468
No, no, no.

10:25.996 --> 10:28.324
Thank you for this opportunity.

10:29.283 --> 10:31.456
I've admired your company's
position towards the environment

10:31.485 --> 10:33.694
for quite some time, and
to be a part of that...

10:33.818 --> 10:36.474
Ma! Ma, I got accepted!

10:37.428 --> 10:39.691
Yeah, I got accepted by...
I got...

10:39.716 --> 10:42.876
"It is of great pleasure
that we write to offer you

10:42.908 --> 10:44.824
"admission to the
College of Engineering

10:44.849 --> 10:47.050
"Class of 2019." Ma!

10:49.967 --> 10:52.153
I don't get to choose
when I go, Tommy.

10:52.955 --> 10:54.268
The Army does that.

10:54.426 --> 10:57.224
I'll text you when I'm at the gate.
I love you both.

10:57.276 --> 10:59.562
- Where you headed?
- Iraq.

11:01.027 --> 11:04.053
- First tour?
- Yes, sir.

11:04.683 --> 11:07.069
I'll be there to pick you up
when you get back.

11:08.307 --> 11:09.653
Thank you.

11:27.157 --> 11:29.966
- As-Salaam-Alaikum.
- Wa-Alaikum-Salaam.

11:30.348 --> 11:31.699
How they comin'?

11:31.731 --> 11:33.198
Left you something upstairs.

11:33.223 --> 11:34.746
- Did you?
- Mm-hmm.

11:35.488 --> 11:36.876
Thank you, Fatima.

11:36.975 --> 11:38.949
- You coming to the potluck?
- Yes, I'm coming.

11:39.016 --> 11:41.784
Plates and napkins,
napkins and plates.

11:43.529 --> 11:45.051
And forks!

13:55.793 --> 13:58.314
I got your name on a piece
of paper in my pocket.

13:58.779 --> 14:00.770
That's all that matters.

14:02.134 --> 14:04.152
Hey, hey, hey!
Look at me.

14:08.691 --> 14:10.629
No, no, no, stop talking.

14:10.813 --> 14:13.087
- This is happening.
- Please don't.

14:13.267 --> 14:14.934
Your son's gonna be
home any second.

14:15.282 --> 14:16.433
Right?

14:17.101 --> 14:19.003
- Open your mouth.
- No.

14:19.786 --> 14:21.051
Open your mouth.

14:40.293 --> 14:41.919
And you don't have
to know anything.

14:46.308 --> 14:47.651
They are the best.

15:07.344 --> 15:08.509
Hey.

15:09.517 --> 15:10.994
Mr. McCall.

15:12.030 --> 15:13.736
Ordered a book last week.

15:13.793 --> 15:15.093
Oh, uh, yeah.

15:21.297 --> 15:22.859
McCall...

15:23.482 --> 15:26.175
I... I don't see it, um...

15:26.519 --> 15:27.944
I'll be right back.

15:35.239 --> 15:38.257
The man with the list. 100
books everyone should read.

15:38.320 --> 15:41.358
- Guilty as charged.
- <i>In Search of Lost Time</i>.

15:41.383 --> 15:42.799
Came in yesterday.

15:42.824 --> 15:44.213
Thank you.

15:44.447 --> 15:46.237
What number?

15:47.083 --> 15:48.681
Last one.

15:49.542 --> 15:51.791
Well, I hope you
start another list.

15:52.167 --> 15:53.437
Me too. How much?

15:53.498 --> 15:55.048
Uh, 40, please.

15:55.356 --> 15:56.791
Thank you.

16:01.117 --> 16:02.745
Sign is down?

16:04.252 --> 16:05.499
"For sale" sign?

16:05.524 --> 16:07.822
Oh, a change of circumstances.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.996
Not going anywhere now.

16:28.879 --> 16:30.392
I don't want a drink.

16:31.886 --> 16:33.559
I don't want a drink.

16:37.077 --> 16:38.455
God...

16:39.726 --> 16:42.894
Grant me the serenity to accept
the things I cannot change...

16:43.384 --> 16:45.621
The courage to change
the things I can...

16:47.439 --> 16:49.776
And the wisdom
to know the difference.

16:55.025 --> 16:56.410
Would you um...

16:56.538 --> 16:59.301
Would you mind taking me
back where you picked me up?

17:28.494 --> 17:30.002
Easy... easy.

17:30.734 --> 17:32.573
One step, keep going.

17:44.723 --> 17:47.656
Could you just...
help her get in her apartment?

17:47.856 --> 17:48.949
Thanks.

18:26.864 --> 18:28.691
Stop cheatin', bro.

18:36.125 --> 18:38.362
How you doin'? I'm the uh,
Lyft driver that you called

18:38.391 --> 18:39.797
to take home your girlfriend.

18:39.822 --> 18:41.835
Not a girlfriend, man.
Just an intern.

18:41.864 --> 18:45.562
Oh, I'm sorry, the uh,
credit card was invalid.

18:46.877 --> 18:48.447
Shithead!

18:48.532 --> 18:50.357
Let you hang with us 'cause
your daddy's a client

18:50.414 --> 18:52.105
and you fuck up the first thing.

18:52.773 --> 18:53.986
Come in.

19:01.949 --> 19:04.516
- There you go.
- Wow.

19:05.418 --> 19:07.918
I heard about these.
I've never seen one before.

19:07.967 --> 19:09.333
Yeah, well, now you have.

19:09.369 --> 19:10.385
Yeah.

19:10.462 --> 19:12.672
Look, pay yourself
whatever and uh,

19:12.736 --> 19:14.533
give yourself a nice tip, huh?

19:14.593 --> 19:16.457
Thank you. Thank you.

19:17.167 --> 19:19.618
You're not gonna ask me
if she got home okay?

19:21.769 --> 19:23.828
- She get home okay?
- No.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.452
Took her Mass General, they're
pumping her stomach as we speak.

19:29.274 --> 19:31.060
What's her name?

19:31.898 --> 19:33.460
You don't know, do you?

19:34.001 --> 19:35.286
Okay.

19:35.620 --> 19:37.893
This is the point where
usually I'd uh...

19:37.918 --> 19:40.226
give you a chance to do the
right thing, but not tonight.

19:40.251 --> 19:43.443
Tonight, I'm gonna need
your cameras, cellphones,

19:43.475 --> 19:46.671
anything you might've used to
record what you did to her.

20:17.824 --> 20:20.251
You knocked on the wrong
door tonight, pops.

20:48.540 --> 20:49.785
Get up.

20:50.240 --> 20:51.398
Get up!

20:55.198 --> 20:57.548
Don't start crying now.
Give me your phone.

21:00.020 --> 21:01.476
Right or left?

21:01.501 --> 21:02.754
I don't know what you mean.

21:02.779 --> 21:04.991
Handed.
Are you right or left-handed?

21:05.117 --> 21:06.951
- Right.
- Call 911.

21:06.993 --> 21:09.428
And tell them the truth about
what happened in here tonight.

21:09.478 --> 21:12.339
Your daddy's money's not gonna save
you this time, you understand?

21:12.364 --> 21:14.096
- Yes, sir.
- You know her name?

21:14.799 --> 21:16.439
No.

21:17.106 --> 21:19.394
Her name is Amy,
give me your left hand.

21:22.720 --> 21:26.944
Give me your left hand.

21:29.905 --> 21:32.646
I expect a five-star rating,
you understand?

21:33.271 --> 21:35.793
- Yes, sir.
- Not for me, though. For who?

21:36.555 --> 21:38.489
- For Amy.
- That's right. For who?

21:38.524 --> 21:40.022
- For Amy.
- For who?

21:48.087 --> 21:50.388
Make sure I get a
five-star rating, junior.

23:06.220 --> 23:07.823
Hello, Susan.

23:10.835 --> 23:13.000
How in God's name do
you know it was me?

23:13.057 --> 23:14.663
I can smell you.

23:14.704 --> 23:16.530
For God's sake, I just peed.

23:17.127 --> 23:20.472
Yeah, but you ate
asparagus vinaigrette.

23:20.585 --> 23:22.972
- With soy sauce.
- Oh, you!

23:23.057 --> 23:25.330
Oh, I smelled your perfume.
How are ya?

23:26.225 --> 23:27.993
- You good?
- Better now.

23:28.035 --> 23:29.413
Ah, very good.

23:29.854 --> 23:31.615
- Got you some.
- Ah, soup!

23:31.686 --> 23:33.341
How'd that thing in
Turkey turn out?

23:33.413 --> 23:34.975
Ah, happy ending.

23:35.024 --> 23:36.637
- Mmm!
- No pun intended.

23:36.662 --> 23:38.789
Well, I guess that means
you owe me dinner.

23:39.570 --> 23:41.516
I didn't agree to pay
for dinner, I...

23:41.715 --> 23:43.043
What, you gonna try
and weasel out?

23:43.086 --> 23:44.425
I'm not weaseling, I just...

23:44.450 --> 23:46.743
Oh, no, no, no, my friend.
I don't work for free.

23:49.804 --> 23:51.125
How's Brian?

23:53.576 --> 23:55.515
He's good. Oh, he's
got a new book out.

23:55.540 --> 23:57.035
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

23:57.180 --> 23:59.172
- Maybe I should read it, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

23:59.233 --> 24:01.776
You know, if geopolitics
of Nepal prior to the

24:01.801 --> 24:05.948
1816 Sugauli Treaty is
your bag, definitely.

24:06.157 --> 24:09.293
- Friendship has its limits.
- So does matrimony.

24:09.343 --> 24:11.168
I haven't read it yet.

24:12.140 --> 24:13.874
Doubt I ever will.

24:14.633 --> 24:16.204
You here on business?

24:16.446 --> 24:17.873
Meetings.

24:18.427 --> 24:20.011
Ahem.

24:20.486 --> 24:22.264
Meetings, huh?

24:22.488 --> 24:24.167
Birthdays are the hardest.

24:28.090 --> 24:29.984
I know, I always think
of my brother on his.

24:30.020 --> 24:31.227
Yeah.

24:32.464 --> 24:35.374
I was uh, folding laundry
the other day, and...

24:36.205 --> 24:39.437
I realized that I didn't have

24:39.615 --> 24:43.734
any clothes left that
Vivian had ever seen.

24:44.134 --> 24:46.184
I can't say that's a bad thing.

24:46.597 --> 24:47.791
What?

24:49.338 --> 24:52.257
Well, she didn't appreciate my
taste in clothing either.

24:52.326 --> 24:55.063
I'd buy something,
the next day it was missing.

24:55.156 --> 24:56.585
I'd ask her about it.

24:56.681 --> 25:00.352
And she... say she didn't know
what I was talking about.

25:00.387 --> 25:01.973
Or she'd act like she didn't
know what I was talking about.

25:01.998 --> 25:03.230
I could tell. And she's,

25:03.255 --> 25:05.174
"I don't know what
happened to those

25:05.199 --> 25:08.164
"purple shirts that
you used to buy."

25:08.294 --> 25:12.094
Then I'd...
put one on that she liked.

25:18.259 --> 25:19.445
What?

25:20.205 --> 25:21.718
I didn't say anything.

25:23.976 --> 25:28.486
I'm sorry if I made a mistake
coming to you on Vivian's birthday.

25:28.520 --> 25:31.207
It's just...
Robert, I've been thinkin'...

25:31.423 --> 25:33.883
Maybe you should
go back, huh?

25:36.830 --> 25:38.897
It's great you helping all these

25:38.933 --> 25:41.696
random people and
everything, but...

25:42.797 --> 25:45.502
It's not gonna fill
that hole in your heart.

25:47.994 --> 25:49.572
Go home, huh?

25:50.672 --> 25:52.179
Make peace with it.

25:55.711 --> 25:57.939
That's what
Vivian would've wanted.

25:59.573 --> 26:00.885
Oh, hey!

26:09.788 --> 26:12.007
- Always a gentleman.
- That's right.

26:12.048 --> 26:14.636
Hey, I'm obligated
to tell you these things.

26:14.998 --> 26:16.898
Man, I'm the only
friend you've got.

26:16.923 --> 26:18.017
Mmm.

26:21.535 --> 26:22.983
Airport, please.

26:49.530 --> 26:51.462
Hey, Mr. McCall, maybe
you could find out

26:51.487 --> 26:53.635
who did this
to Fatima's garden.

26:58.686 --> 26:59.927
Kids.

27:21.373 --> 27:23.634
- What up, man?
- How you doing?

27:28.730 --> 27:31.978
Hey, you should make
the building do that.

27:32.523 --> 27:34.410
It's what they're
supposed to do.

27:34.648 --> 27:39.675
'Supposed to do' and 'will do'
are two different things, Miles.

27:40.179 --> 27:42.426
- Yeah, but you live here, right?
- That's right.

27:42.497 --> 27:44.032
Pay the rent, too.

27:44.358 --> 27:46.183
You should let somebody
else do this, then.

27:46.208 --> 27:47.466
Like who?

27:47.509 --> 27:49.221
Shit, I don't know.

27:49.482 --> 27:51.123
- Anybody.
- Huh?

27:51.169 --> 27:52.419
Not a tenant.

27:52.444 --> 27:53.943
You're right. I guess
anybody could do it,

27:53.986 --> 27:55.925
but nobody does, Miles.

27:56.067 --> 27:57.750
It ends up everybody

27:57.843 --> 27:59.874
complaining because
nobody did what

27:59.966 --> 28:01.944
anybody coulda done.

28:02.083 --> 28:04.675
Or shoulda done
to begin with.

28:05.167 --> 28:06.365
Yeah.

28:07.512 --> 28:08.766
Aight.

28:10.701 --> 28:12.050
You know they got uh,

28:12.100 --> 28:13.699
they got painting
companies around here.

28:13.731 --> 28:16.973
I know they charge $6-700
to do the job. I know that.

28:16.998 --> 28:19.201
Ssh... Oh, yeah?

28:20.990 --> 28:22.957
Shit, I'll do this for $350.

28:24.150 --> 28:25.358
You?

28:25.429 --> 28:26.793
Ssh, yeah!

28:27.446 --> 28:29.173
- What?
- Nothin'.

28:29.224 --> 28:31.297
What, I look handicapped
or somethin'?

28:31.763 --> 28:34.495
Yo, it's a quick dip and roll,
it ain't rocket science.

28:34.545 --> 28:35.781
No, you're right.

28:36.081 --> 28:37.897
I'm an artist, man.

28:39.354 --> 28:41.727
I go to Bridgeview Arts.

28:43.060 --> 28:44.944
Why aren't you in school?

28:45.591 --> 28:48.283
I don't be doin' all them
everyday classes.

28:50.211 --> 28:51.706
You know I got a

28:51.777 --> 28:54.021
- a special talent.
- Yes, you do.

28:54.777 --> 28:56.770
And it takes talent
to make money.

28:58.739 --> 29:01.166
But it takes brains
to keep it, Miles.

29:03.180 --> 29:05.328
Yeah, well, I'm out here
makin' my money, man.

29:05.449 --> 29:07.335
Short money, Miles.

29:07.506 --> 29:09.236
That's short money.

29:11.616 --> 29:13.060
I tell you what...

29:14.979 --> 29:16.760
$350's a little high.

29:18.656 --> 29:20.425
But I appreciate the offer.

29:22.394 --> 29:23.670
Aight.

29:23.795 --> 29:25.478
- All right?
- Aight.

29:27.686 --> 29:29.717
This gonna be
a lotta work, man.

29:30.997 --> 29:33.418
- Aight, Mr. McCall.
- All right.

29:55.044 --> 29:56.827
So, you still
out here doin' this?

29:56.897 --> 29:58.339
Yes, I am.

29:58.370 --> 30:00.058
You ain't coverin' nothin'.

30:00.251 --> 30:01.677
Not yet.

30:02.494 --> 30:04.110
What is this,
Wal-Mart paint?

30:04.451 --> 30:07.348
Primer. You gotta
prime it before you paint it.

30:07.389 --> 30:08.870
They don't teach you
that in art school?

30:09.550 --> 30:11.014
Yeah, I knew that.

30:14.321 --> 30:16.135
I've been thinkin'
'bout your offer.

30:17.498 --> 30:20.473
I've been uh, calibratin' uh...

30:21.526 --> 30:22.975
250.

30:25.070 --> 30:26.661
- 250?
- Yeah.

30:26.769 --> 30:28.770
250, I take care
all o' this for you.

30:30.330 --> 30:32.442
- For 250?
- Yeah.

30:33.727 --> 30:35.445
All right but,

30:35.653 --> 30:37.599
you can only work on it
after school.

30:37.689 --> 30:39.715
- Ssh...
- Don't curse.

30:39.792 --> 30:41.680
What time you get out?

30:42.697 --> 30:45.643
- 3:15.
- Okay. After school, 3:15, deal?

30:46.325 --> 30:47.532
Okay?

30:47.901 --> 30:49.200
Aight.

30:50.550 --> 30:53.124
- Cash, aight?
- Okay, cash.

30:53.214 --> 30:55.536
- Don't checkin' me, aight?
- I'll be checkin' <i>for</i> you.

30:55.614 --> 30:56.993
Tss... aight.

30:59.812 --> 31:01.183
Miles!

31:01.636 --> 31:03.605
Stay off them corners, son.

31:06.253 --> 31:07.997
Oil on his lips.

31:08.800 --> 31:12.728
Nine millimeter at his feet
was registered to the victim.

31:12.906 --> 31:15.086
No other prints in the house.

31:15.381 --> 31:16.703
You have questions?

31:16.798 --> 31:18.826
Oh, Mr. Calbert did work for us.

31:18.884 --> 31:21.227
And when something
occurs to one of ours,

31:21.277 --> 31:23.173
the agency's obligated
to look into it,

31:23.213 --> 31:25.288
So, yes, you will be hearing
from us, thank you.

31:25.325 --> 31:26.461
Susan, Susan...

31:26.504 --> 31:28.876
Keep it locked down
until we get there, please.

31:28.942 --> 31:30.190
I can't find
a file on this guy.

31:30.226 --> 31:31.491
When did he become
one of ours?

31:31.522 --> 31:32.666
I don't know.

31:32.691 --> 31:35.482
Upstairs kept him off the
radar for some reason.

31:35.999 --> 31:37.768
- Car's here. Car's here.
- Oh, okay.

31:37.811 --> 31:39.117
- Oh, you look great.
- It's okay?

31:39.160 --> 31:40.465
- What about a tie?
- Um...

31:40.529 --> 31:41.814
- You need a tie, darlin'.
- I...

31:41.867 --> 31:43.157
- Do what she says, Brian.
- Have one?

31:43.251 --> 31:45.267
- Got it.
- Great, that's perfect!

31:45.302 --> 31:46.353
I'll see you, dear.

31:46.389 --> 31:48.094
- Have fun, sweetheart.
- Bye.

31:48.463 --> 31:50.820
Yeah, I'm gonna have to go
over there and cross the t's.

31:50.864 --> 31:52.071
Wanna come?

31:52.121 --> 31:53.996
Oh, damn, and leave
this shitty office?

31:54.444 --> 31:56.254
You know Brussels
has the best chocolates.

31:56.279 --> 31:59.159
Hmm, well, we'll go
and find out.

31:59.504 --> 32:02.012
Today, I broke a personal best:

32:02.069 --> 32:04.825
Successive days alive.

32:06.025 --> 32:09.910
All right. Here,
I got photographic evidence.

32:09.984 --> 32:13.646
That's the portrait
of my sister, Magda.

32:13.947 --> 32:15.513
I was nine.

32:15.938 --> 32:17.573
The war came.

32:17.644 --> 32:20.386
Like most families,
we were separated.

32:20.840 --> 32:24.569
My sister Magda and I
were sent to different camps.

32:25.197 --> 32:27.175
I never saw her again.

32:27.794 --> 32:31.925
60 years later, I'm in Paris.

32:32.133 --> 32:35.998
And I see somebody
auctioning my painting.

32:37.037 --> 32:39.527
12 million, can you imagine?

32:39.930 --> 32:43.756
"You've got to have proof,"
they say, to get it back.

32:44.128 --> 32:47.487
Now, I got here
the proof.

32:48.026 --> 32:51.024
Wait till the judge sees this.

32:51.707 --> 32:54.082
Looks like there's
coming a storm.

32:55.091 --> 32:57.972
- It's time for your check-up, Sam.
- Oh.

32:58.416 --> 33:00.313
Hello, sweetheart.

33:05.739 --> 33:07.756
He's still obsessed
with the painting.

33:07.913 --> 33:09.660
Tried to help him years ago.

33:09.879 --> 33:13.220
He said he uh, had proof it
was his even way back then.

33:13.290 --> 33:14.681
He didn't.

33:15.038 --> 33:17.133
No record, no bill of sales.

33:17.797 --> 33:21.072
He just keeps going back to
court to hear the same thing.

33:22.022 --> 33:25.198
Guess it gives him something
to focus on, I suppose.

33:25.284 --> 33:27.776
It helps when
you have nobody left.

33:36.813 --> 33:38.178
I thought the reading
went great.

33:38.256 --> 33:39.528
- Embarrassing!
- No.

33:39.599 --> 33:41.871
I signed two books,
that's all.

33:44.034 --> 33:45.053
Thank you!

33:45.078 --> 33:46.822
You sure we can't
drop you off at the airport?

33:46.847 --> 33:48.547
No, I'm fine, Brian.
Thank you.

33:48.583 --> 33:49.961
- Thanks so much for coming.
- All right.

33:50.037 --> 33:51.322
- Good night.
- Good night.

33:51.356 --> 33:52.658
- Listen, do me a favor.
- Yeah?

33:52.715 --> 33:55.258
See what you can
find out. Yeah?

33:55.298 --> 33:57.005
Oh, another dinner, then.

33:57.060 --> 33:58.755
I'll see what I can do.

33:58.780 --> 34:00.620
I do fly off
to Brussels tomorrow.

34:00.673 --> 34:02.576
- Thought you were retired?
- Oh, I am.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.253
Just like you're dead.

34:04.301 --> 34:05.317
Okay.

34:05.361 --> 34:06.881
- Good night.
- Good, good night.

34:13.152 --> 34:14.907
What are you painting?

34:16.603 --> 34:17.847
It's primer.

34:18.676 --> 34:20.081
And then paint it.

34:20.751 --> 34:24.317
So all this bullshit under there,
don't show through.

34:25.304 --> 34:27.129
My brother painted that.

34:29.344 --> 34:31.107
It's the place we grew up.

34:31.226 --> 34:32.414
Yeah?

34:32.627 --> 34:34.181
And you live here now.

35:07.243 --> 35:09.518
Powder of some sort.

35:18.796 --> 35:21.563
Hard drive contents
and cell records?

35:22.082 --> 35:24.777
You'll have them later today.

35:32.165 --> 35:33.535
Susan...

35:35.754 --> 35:37.698
Okay. Thank you.

35:37.898 --> 35:39.766
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

35:43.386 --> 35:44.607
Merci.

35:46.364 --> 35:47.725
Right behind you.

36:02.508 --> 36:05.891
I don't know. It seems
to me, the judge...

36:06.224 --> 36:09.570
He doesn't even
pay any attention to me.

36:11.379 --> 36:15.458
I mean, he hardly looked
at all the evidence I had.

36:16.351 --> 36:18.182
Well, that's it.

36:18.275 --> 36:20.903
It was a very
rare painting, Sam.

36:20.945 --> 36:24.730
Maybe... maybe that's the reason
why it looked so familiar to you.

36:39.659 --> 36:41.820
This is my sister, Magda.

36:43.495 --> 36:46.834
I was younger, but that's
the only picture survived.

36:46.919 --> 36:48.120
Mm.

36:48.597 --> 36:52.516
My uncle
commissioned the portrait

36:52.651 --> 36:55.215
as a gift for her 12th birthday.

36:55.991 --> 36:58.342
It was a young artist,
just beginning.

36:58.413 --> 37:01.318
But oh, you should've seen it.

37:01.586 --> 37:03.037
Not just the resemblance

37:03.146 --> 37:06.001
but a spirit that shone through.

37:06.065 --> 37:09.339
It glowed, you know,
like a beacon.

37:10.909 --> 37:14.765
"My little brother," she'd say.
"My Sammy."

37:16.090 --> 37:18.245
I could never protect her.

37:19.583 --> 37:21.954
To lose her twice...

37:24.509 --> 37:26.459
I can't imagine it.

37:28.960 --> 37:30.004
Hello, Susan.

37:30.039 --> 37:32.432
Hey, I had no idea you
were such an art lover.

37:32.717 --> 37:35.330
That information you wanted,
just came in.

37:35.355 --> 37:37.471
- Kinda surprising.
- Okay.

37:37.515 --> 37:39.314
- I'm sending it to you right now.
- Good.

37:39.776 --> 37:40.834
Yeah.

37:40.899 --> 37:43.313
Calbert's bank records are fine.

37:44.411 --> 37:46.624
Texts, emails.

37:46.710 --> 37:48.599
No marital discord.

37:48.740 --> 37:51.255
No girlfriends, no boyfriends,
no lovers.

37:51.320 --> 37:53.779
Not even an inappropriate
message to a co-worker.

37:53.822 --> 37:55.335
And what about the wife?

37:55.406 --> 37:58.382
Oh, come on, Dave,
women fuck around too.

38:01.540 --> 38:03.327
I mean, think about it.

38:03.441 --> 38:05.640
When's the last time you
sent your wife flowers, hmm?

38:05.725 --> 38:07.430
Noted. Noted.

38:11.829 --> 38:14.408
Data on Calbert's
hard drive just came in.

38:14.650 --> 38:16.218
No, we'll talk about it
on the plane.

38:16.289 --> 38:17.931
I wanna get outta here
as soon as we can,

38:17.980 --> 38:19.713
run something through
his best hand.

38:27.937 --> 38:29.801
All right, watch it.

38:30.731 --> 38:33.800
Excusez-moi, monsieur.
Pardon.

38:33.942 --> 38:35.133
Merci.

38:53.918 --> 38:56.510
- I'll see you downstairs at 6:00?
- You got it.

38:56.788 --> 38:58.194
Oh, and hey, how
'bout some of that

38:58.230 --> 39:00.226
delicious Belgian chocolate
you're always talkin' about?

39:00.306 --> 39:02.100
Or you'll not gettin' on
the plane.

39:04.832 --> 39:06.760
Guess I'm goin' back out.

39:23.043 --> 39:24.581
Oh, crap.

39:30.232 --> 39:31.505
Oh, good.

39:42.372 --> 39:43.771
W-What do you want?!

39:43.877 --> 39:44.957
Let me go!

39:56.919 --> 39:58.652
What do you fucking want?

39:58.815 --> 40:00.527
Who the fuck are you?

40:00.619 --> 40:01.926
Come on!

40:35.606 --> 40:37.636
We could make this pop out.

40:38.073 --> 40:40.073
Picasso this entire buildin'.

40:40.272 --> 40:41.643
Picasso it?

40:41.764 --> 40:43.787
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Okay. How much?

40:44.020 --> 40:45.796
It's on the house.

40:45.954 --> 40:47.275
I like that.

40:53.653 --> 40:55.401
Been drawin' a long time?

40:55.465 --> 40:58.896
Since uh, about third grade.

40:59.412 --> 41:00.934
What is this?

41:02.896 --> 41:04.910
That's how I sign my work.

41:06.185 --> 41:08.356
My brother, he was a boxer.

41:08.570 --> 41:10.693
It's the right hand o' God.

41:11.389 --> 41:13.925
He catch you with it,
you know...

41:14.095 --> 41:16.769
You go to heaven, or uh...

41:18.195 --> 41:19.344
Okay.

41:20.917 --> 41:23.784
- He still fightin'?
- Ah...

41:24.970 --> 41:26.916
Somebody shot him

41:27.770 --> 41:29.526
comin' back from the gym.

41:29.665 --> 41:32.125
Not even ganged up on
or nothin'.

41:32.898 --> 41:34.781
Just wanted his gym bag.

41:43.980 --> 41:45.266
What?

41:47.890 --> 41:49.364
I didn't say anything.

41:50.280 --> 41:51.928
Anyway.

41:52.617 --> 41:55.337
My grandmother says
if you don't

41:55.572 --> 41:57.475
remember somebody out loud,

41:57.606 --> 41:59.655
they die twice.

42:03.697 --> 42:05.968
Your grandmother was wise.
Hey, Brian.

42:06.251 --> 42:08.297
Yeah, listen, I'm-I'm reading
your book right now.

42:08.333 --> 42:09.882
I can't believe you...

42:26.355 --> 42:27.484
Yeah.

42:37.031 --> 42:38.435
Yeah.

42:41.723 --> 42:42.991
Got it.

42:47.505 --> 42:49.198
Yo, Mr. McCall, you good?

42:50.871 --> 42:52.534
Hey, yo, Mr. McCall!

43:39.196 --> 43:40.570
Thanks, Dave.

44:02.450 --> 44:05.490
The police from Brussels said

44:05.611 --> 44:08.927
it happens in these hotels,
these robberies.

44:09.972 --> 44:12.485
But she never wore any jewelry.

44:14.135 --> 44:16.228
Not even a watch.

44:20.146 --> 44:21.566
Except for this.

44:31.729 --> 44:33.357
What'd the agency say?

44:35.011 --> 44:36.475
They said...

44:37.130 --> 44:39.067
They'd do everything
in their power.

44:40.040 --> 44:42.050
They're working with Interpol.

44:44.361 --> 44:46.865
Promised to find
whoever it was.

44:48.907 --> 44:50.067
But...

44:54.062 --> 44:55.956
I don't know what to do now.

48:11.787 --> 48:15.236
<i>Things to remember as the storm
continues its march north...</i>

48:15.314 --> 48:18.056
<i>as we saw what Frances did to the
southeast part of the country.</i>

48:18.177 --> 48:20.506
<i>It appears to be
moving here as slowly</i>

48:20.534 --> 48:22.239
<i>as it left the Gulf Coast.</i>

48:22.339 --> 48:24.639
<i>That is what worries
meteorologists now.</i>

48:24.717 --> 48:27.392
<i>Even as the storm is moving
up the Eastern Seaboard,</i>

48:27.417 --> 48:30.143
<i>every city and town
that has been hit</i>

48:30.198 --> 48:32.187
<i>has experienced storm surge...</i>

48:33.770 --> 48:35.574
<i>Dangerous flood levels.</i>

49:19.544 --> 49:22.377
<i>Excusez-moi monsieur.
Pardon.</i>

49:22.555 --> 49:24.167
<i>Merci.</i>

49:32.733 --> 49:34.843
<i>Excusez-moi monsieur.</i>

49:37.263 --> 49:39.496
<i>- I'll see you downstairs at 6:00?
- You got it.</i>

49:41.478 --> 49:43.580
<i>- I'll see you downstairs at 6:00?
- You got it.</i>

50:08.512 --> 50:10.329
You got fat, Dave.

50:32.473 --> 50:36.639
I was in the same lobby
when that bomb went off.

50:36.852 --> 50:38.819
Looking right at you.

50:40.353 --> 50:42.363
When that hotel
came down on us.

50:46.304 --> 50:48.095
You were there
and then you weren't.

50:50.156 --> 50:51.745
Wasn't my day.

50:54.545 --> 50:56.172
I went to your funeral.

50:56.646 --> 50:58.069
Grieved...

50:58.565 --> 51:00.483
A long time over you.

51:04.301 --> 51:06.101
Susan, she knew?

51:09.182 --> 51:10.930
I was your partner for
seven years, Mac.

51:10.966 --> 51:12.443
I never kept anything from you.

51:12.496 --> 51:13.970
I'm sorry, Dave.

51:14.417 --> 51:15.589
I am.

51:18.523 --> 51:21.207
I never had a chance
to say how sorry I was.

51:22.631 --> 51:24.297
About Vivian.

51:24.532 --> 51:25.789
Well...

51:28.014 --> 51:29.830
You still at the beach?

51:31.287 --> 51:33.082
Not in a long time.

51:34.055 --> 51:35.781
Well, I got me that cabin.

51:37.696 --> 51:40.334
Take the wife and kids up
couple times a year.

51:42.485 --> 51:44.190
Wouldn't have any of it...

51:46.081 --> 51:47.734
If it weren't for Susan.

51:50.586 --> 51:51.975
Life got...

51:54.250 --> 51:55.981
Dark.

51:57.853 --> 52:00.363
She talked me off that ledge
I was heading over.

52:01.015 --> 52:03.423
Probably over a bowl of soup.

52:03.545 --> 52:04.930
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

52:08.806 --> 52:10.426
I owe her my life.

52:12.811 --> 52:14.780
Ever talk to the boys?

52:15.725 --> 52:17.209
No, not for years.

52:21.960 --> 52:23.800
Hell of a team we were, right?

52:26.165 --> 52:28.065
She never pushed
the button, Dave.

52:28.184 --> 52:30.084
- Who?
- Susan.

52:30.843 --> 52:32.230
On the elevator.

52:32.883 --> 52:34.743
She never pushed
her floor number.

52:34.808 --> 52:36.464
I checked all the video.

52:37.501 --> 52:39.526
Backpackers got on the first.

52:39.706 --> 52:42.663
They pushed number 16,
she didn't have to.

52:44.221 --> 52:46.172
They knew what floor
she was on.

52:47.759 --> 52:49.374
You find them?

52:50.271 --> 52:51.989
Pieces of them.

52:52.960 --> 52:55.911
Couple of tweakers
with sheets as long as my arm.

52:56.066 --> 52:58.389
My good arm, anyway.

52:59.078 --> 53:00.812
Gas explosion.

53:00.911 --> 53:02.296
At least that's what
they're calling it.

53:02.332 --> 53:03.908
What do you call it?

53:05.352 --> 53:07.070
Tying up loose ends.

53:10.358 --> 53:12.292
Autopsy report:

53:12.371 --> 53:14.362
Stab wound...

53:15.585 --> 53:18.179
Two millimeters
below her third rib.

53:18.379 --> 53:20.313
- Close quarter technique...
- Exactly.

53:20.397 --> 53:22.732
That was taught.
This was no robbery.

53:24.672 --> 53:26.867
Something else went on
in the room.

53:44.892 --> 53:46.497
What's the word, bro?

56:51.141 --> 56:52.258
York.

56:52.292 --> 56:53.486
Dave.

56:55.428 --> 56:57.464
Listen, the gun...

56:58.948 --> 57:01.541
next to Calbert
was on his right side.

57:04.752 --> 57:06.605
He was right-handed.
Why?

57:06.669 --> 57:09.489
His wife was shot by
somebody left-handed.

57:10.090 --> 57:12.152
Somebody else
was in that room.

57:14.052 --> 57:16.669
Powder residue came
from the latex glove.

57:17.401 --> 57:21.790
20,000 euros were found
in the backpackers' flat.

57:22.785 --> 57:24.461
- Hey, Bob.
- Hey.

57:27.528 --> 57:29.190
Those guys were set up.

57:29.329 --> 57:31.740
Right. Agency assets
are taken out all the time.

57:31.772 --> 57:35.657
Opposite side loves...
sending a message.

57:36.437 --> 57:37.908
Why stage it?

57:39.343 --> 57:41.232
They didn't know
he was one of ours.

57:41.407 --> 57:44.244
Susan was about to figure out
who was in that room.

57:44.377 --> 57:46.239
That's why she was killed, Dave.

57:46.350 --> 57:47.887
The two are connected.

57:48.414 --> 57:50.927
I'll call get back to you
when I know more.

57:51.699 --> 57:53.370
Keep me posted.

58:59.709 --> 59:01.577
Yo, man, elevator's closed.

59:15.462 --> 59:18.402
Listen up, little nigga,
you ready to put in work?

59:18.466 --> 59:20.391
'Cause everybody in
my camp put his work.

59:21.549 --> 59:22.976
Ain't no bullshit.

01:00:00.982 --> 01:00:02.686
Pass that blunt.

01:00:12.325 --> 01:00:13.447
You sure?

01:00:13.994 --> 01:00:15.360
Listen, man.

01:00:15.361 --> 01:00:17.460
You know you gotta
spin the bin tonight, right?

01:00:17.602 --> 01:00:19.087
You know you gotta
spin the bin.

01:00:19.482 --> 01:00:21.250
Didn't them niggas
kill your brother?

01:00:22.187 --> 01:00:23.387
Yeah.

01:00:23.934 --> 01:00:26.200
Right. Gotta go take
care of that tonight.

01:00:26.236 --> 01:00:27.720
Run down on them niggas.

01:00:27.754 --> 01:00:29.778
Make sure you kill one
them L niggas tonight.

01:00:30.446 --> 01:00:32.372
Make sure you empty
that whole thing.

01:00:33.339 --> 01:00:37.130
Yo, listen, your mother
already buried your brother.

01:00:37.648 --> 01:00:39.907
Do have her bury two sons.

01:00:40.689 --> 01:00:42.978
- You hear me?
- Yeah.

01:00:43.078 --> 01:00:44.819
Don't come back
without it empty.

01:00:44.967 --> 01:00:46.409
That's a fact, B.

01:00:47.942 --> 01:00:49.051
Shit.

01:00:49.295 --> 01:00:50.919
- Let's go, Miles.
- Oh, shit!

01:00:50.997 --> 01:00:52.765
Sit down. Sit down.
Sit down.

01:00:52.836 --> 01:00:54.477
Who the fuck is this nigga?

01:00:54.584 --> 01:00:56.679
I'm your father, your momma
just didn't tell you.

01:00:56.806 --> 01:00:58.162
Let's go, Miles.

01:00:58.376 --> 01:01:00.251
Let's go, Miles.

01:01:03.951 --> 01:01:05.692
Let's go, Miles!

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:09.974
Where you goin'?

01:01:11.414 --> 01:01:12.724
Yeah?

01:01:15.708 --> 01:01:16.840
Bang.

01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:18.625
Yo, who the fuck was that, yo?

01:01:18.813 --> 01:01:20.487
Look at this shit here!

01:01:20.723 --> 01:01:23.064
Yo, what the fuck happened, yo?
What the fuck is goin' on, yo?

01:01:23.199 --> 01:01:25.826
- Come on!
- Get the fuck off of me, man!

01:01:27.158 --> 01:01:28.318
Huh?

01:01:29.342 --> 01:01:31.435
- You know where the fuck we at?
- I know. Do you?

01:01:31.471 --> 01:01:33.520
I know where we are.
This what you want?

01:01:33.904 --> 01:01:35.473
Is it what you want?
I thought you want to draw.

01:01:35.498 --> 01:01:36.710
Isn't that what you said?

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:38.272
- Draw?
- Yeah.

01:01:38.456 --> 01:01:40.722
- Paint?
- Yeah!

01:01:41.594 --> 01:01:43.385
What the fuck is that
gonna get me?

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:46.865
That shit 'bout to
put food in my fuckin' Ma's table?

01:01:47.881 --> 01:01:49.139
Huh?

01:01:49.565 --> 01:01:51.937
That shit gon' pay
the fuckin' bills?

01:01:53.549 --> 01:01:54.643
Nah.

01:01:54.778 --> 01:01:56.755
You need to be a gangsta.
You need to be a killer.

01:01:56.819 --> 01:01:58.879
A little yummy, huh?
You need them.

01:01:59.265 --> 01:02:00.669
Okay, if that's what you want.

01:02:01.002 --> 01:02:03.850
If that's what makes you feel
like a man, then be a real man.

01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:05.606
Let's get jumped in
right now, here.

01:02:05.683 --> 01:02:06.791
- Start with me.
- No.

01:02:06.879 --> 01:02:08.801
No, start with me.
Here, start with me.

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:09.953
- No, take it.
- No.

01:02:09.981 --> 01:02:11.430
Come on, killer.
Come on, killer.

01:02:11.477 --> 01:02:13.213
Come on, killer.
Do it right there.

01:02:13.412 --> 01:02:14.747
You know how to hold it?

01:02:14.916 --> 01:02:16.897
You know what you doin'?
Come on, killer.

01:02:17.216 --> 01:02:18.744
There you go.

01:02:19.214 --> 01:02:20.420
There you go.

01:02:20.866 --> 01:02:22.159
There you go.

01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:26.521
Five pounds of pressure,
that's all it takes.

01:02:27.024 --> 01:02:28.267
Come on, gangsta.

01:02:28.427 --> 01:02:30.441
Five pounds of pressure,
that's all it takes.

01:02:30.881 --> 01:02:33.651
Five pounds of pressure,
that's all it takes.

01:02:35.226 --> 01:02:37.413
Alright, c'mon, give it to me.
You don't want, give it to me.

01:02:37.599 --> 01:02:38.983
C'mon, give it to me.

01:02:39.027 --> 01:02:40.589
I ain't gonna do nothin' to you.

01:02:41.107 --> 01:02:43.891
See, you know what they are
up there? They're liars.

01:02:43.963 --> 01:02:45.178
And so am I.

01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:46.332
Hey, yo, yo, yo!

01:02:46.357 --> 01:02:47.858
See what happens when
you deal with a liar?

01:02:47.889 --> 01:02:49.005
- Hey, hey, hey...
- Huh?

01:02:49.070 --> 01:02:50.774
You see what happens
when you deal with a liar?

01:02:50.824 --> 01:02:52.344
I lied to your little punk ass.

01:02:52.386 --> 01:02:53.913
- Aight!
- Now, I'ma kill you.

01:02:53.992 --> 01:02:55.285
What do you see when
you look at me? Tell me.

01:02:55.321 --> 01:02:56.479
You better give me a right
answer. What do you see

01:02:56.514 --> 01:02:57.842
- when you look at me?
- I do not know!

01:02:57.867 --> 01:02:59.562
- Killer! What you see, yummy?
- I do not know, I don't know.

01:02:59.612 --> 01:03:00.975
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

01:03:01.295 --> 01:03:02.488
I don't know.

01:03:03.066 --> 01:03:04.082
Aight.

01:03:04.131 --> 01:03:06.039
Man ain't spelled g-u-n, son.

01:03:09.335 --> 01:03:11.063
You got a choice.

01:03:11.383 --> 01:03:12.839
You got talent.

01:03:13.123 --> 01:03:14.188
You got a chance.

01:03:14.238 --> 01:03:15.423
And I don't wanna hear
about your environment.

01:03:15.484 --> 01:03:16.717
And what your momma
didn't give you.

01:03:16.752 --> 01:03:18.122
And the white man won't
give you no shot.

01:03:18.187 --> 01:03:19.579
You got a chance.

01:03:19.771 --> 01:03:22.150
Use it while you're still alive!

01:03:22.348 --> 01:03:24.316
You don't know what death is!

01:03:24.777 --> 01:03:27.384
You have no idea
what death is!

01:03:30.119 --> 01:03:31.389
Make a decision.

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:32.832
Alright.

01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:41.179
Hey, yo, Mr. McCall!

01:03:43.642 --> 01:03:45.716
- Why me?
- Why not you?

01:03:51.968 --> 01:03:53.806
But... But why me?

01:03:55.419 --> 01:03:57.094
Let's find out together.

01:04:02.659 --> 01:04:05.351
<i>And with a storm this size, that
surge could be as much as six feet.</i>

01:04:05.422 --> 01:04:07.127
<i>It's the speed of the hurricane</i>

01:04:07.253 --> 01:04:11.089
<i>and that giant eye that could
absolutely deluge the coast.</i>

01:04:33.827 --> 01:04:34.914
Hello?

01:04:35.076 --> 01:04:36.725
Mr. McCall?

01:04:38.252 --> 01:04:39.267
Who is it?

01:04:39.331 --> 01:04:40.780
It's me, Miles.

01:04:44.736 --> 01:04:47.264
- I finished the bricks outside.
- Yeah, I saw it.

01:04:49.686 --> 01:04:51.142
Oh, uh...

01:04:51.362 --> 01:04:53.450
Here's your change
for the extra paint.

01:04:54.246 --> 01:04:56.555
- That's all of it?
- Yeah.

01:04:58.444 --> 01:05:00.646
So, anyway, uh...

01:05:02.641 --> 01:05:04.204
You have somethin' to drink?

01:05:04.350 --> 01:05:05.596
Yes, I do.

01:05:07.819 --> 01:05:09.090
Would you like
somethin' to drink?

01:05:09.126 --> 01:05:10.163
Yeah.

01:05:10.227 --> 01:05:11.483
Come on in.

01:05:14.427 --> 01:05:16.096
Iced tea or water?

01:05:16.174 --> 01:05:18.518
Tss, what do I look like,
Jackie Chan?

01:05:25.304 --> 01:05:27.154
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:05:30.185 --> 01:05:32.176
You know they
sell these in sets.

01:05:32.893 --> 01:05:34.157
Yeah.

01:05:47.262 --> 01:05:48.547
What you makin'?

01:05:48.618 --> 01:05:49.954
Arroz con pollo.

01:05:51.497 --> 01:05:53.661
- Yo, Moms makes the same thing.
- Does she?

01:05:53.732 --> 01:05:54.907
Yeah, she puts some...

01:05:55.333 --> 01:05:56.626
I'm not your moms.

01:05:57.303 --> 01:05:58.977
And that's not your pot.

01:05:59.336 --> 01:06:00.837
And this is not your house.

01:06:01.583 --> 01:06:03.330
- You understand? Okay.
- Yeah.

01:06:13.319 --> 01:06:14.914
Yo, this wall need a paint job.

01:06:14.999 --> 01:06:16.171
Yeah, it does.

01:06:16.370 --> 01:06:17.479
Yeah.

01:06:17.556 --> 01:06:19.935
- I could do it for you.
- Could you?

01:06:20.206 --> 01:06:21.230
Yeah.

01:06:21.264 --> 01:06:22.419
How much?

01:06:24.566 --> 01:06:26.490
If I could get
a plate of that food.

01:06:27.798 --> 01:06:29.367
Tss, yeah, man.

01:06:30.447 --> 01:06:31.960
No, seriously, uh...

01:06:32.549 --> 01:06:33.941
115.

01:06:34.227 --> 01:06:35.521
That cool?

01:06:36.452 --> 01:06:38.391
All right, I'll make
a deal with you.

01:06:40.678 --> 01:06:41.874
115, huh?

01:06:41.939 --> 01:06:43.147
Yeah.

01:06:43.647 --> 01:06:45.514
Here you go. Free.

01:06:46.651 --> 01:06:48.398
Read that.
Can you read?

01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:50.485
- Yeah.
- What's it say?

01:06:52.384 --> 01:06:54.776
Ta-Nehisi Coates,
<i>Between the World and Me.</i>

01:06:54.883 --> 01:06:56.857
All right. You read that,
we got a deal.

01:07:02.243 --> 01:07:04.026
- Airport?
- Yeah.

01:07:04.581 --> 01:07:06.534
Is it somebody's birthday?

01:07:07.111 --> 01:07:09.382
- My daughter.
- Nice.

01:07:13.251 --> 01:07:14.978
How old is she?

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:17.102
She's five.

01:08:15.621 --> 01:08:17.809
Guess you don't fly
that often, huh?

01:08:19.131 --> 01:08:21.091
Been drivin' in the
opposite direction of Logan

01:08:21.127 --> 01:08:22.747
for the last three minutes.

01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:55.075
Hey!

01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:56.113
No crust, please, Mom.

01:10:56.268 --> 01:10:57.576
- Mom?
- Eat up, sweetie.

01:10:57.637 --> 01:10:59.081
Why do I have to go
to the dentist

01:10:59.124 --> 01:11:00.539
I never had to go
to the dentist.

01:11:00.603 --> 01:11:01.907
Gotta be the gardener.

01:11:01.958 --> 01:11:04.124
- Grapes.
- You know where the grapes are?

01:11:07.761 --> 01:11:09.966
Oh, my God.

01:11:10.196 --> 01:11:13.117
My life is so hard.

01:11:13.217 --> 01:11:14.417
Here's your grapes.

01:11:16.150 --> 01:11:17.471
Come on, show me
what you can do.

01:11:17.563 --> 01:11:18.714
But... seriously?

01:11:19.118 --> 01:11:20.262
Seriously.

01:11:21.414 --> 01:11:22.607
Hi, baby.

01:11:24.936 --> 01:11:26.772
Mommy made a nice map.

01:11:28.233 --> 01:11:30.037
A: Miane, very good.

01:11:30.269 --> 01:11:31.912
B: New hams...

01:11:32.963 --> 01:11:34.213
New Hamster.

01:11:34.569 --> 01:11:36.657
Carol, who is it?

01:11:42.381 --> 01:11:43.691
Carol?

01:11:44.295 --> 01:11:46.442
It's New Hampshire,
not New hamster.

01:11:46.485 --> 01:11:49.344
But I like it as New hamster.

01:11:50.246 --> 01:11:51.489
Okay, we'll leave it...

01:11:51.552 --> 01:11:53.393
Honey, the front
doorbell's broken.

01:11:53.449 --> 01:11:54.920
Your old Army buddy
was at the back door

01:11:54.970 --> 01:11:56.220
for almost five minutes.

01:11:56.328 --> 01:11:59.182
Actually, I was his team leader.
Seven years.

01:11:59.618 --> 01:12:03.419
Oh, my... Baby, I'm so sorry
I must've forgot. This is...

01:12:03.503 --> 01:12:04.861
I got the days mixed up.

01:12:04.941 --> 01:12:07.079
This is Robert McCall,
this is my wife, Carol.

01:12:07.146 --> 01:12:09.058
- Hi.
- Hi, pleasure to meet you, Robert.

01:12:09.308 --> 01:12:11.743
These are our daughters,
Molly, Alice.

01:12:11.792 --> 01:12:13.082
- Come here baby, come here.
- How are you?

01:12:13.106 --> 01:12:14.250
- Say hi to...
- Please make yourself at home.

01:12:14.286 --> 01:12:16.068
- Oh, thank you.
- Call him Mac.

01:12:16.104 --> 01:12:18.604
- Do you want some coffee?
- Uh, no, I'm fine, thank you.

01:12:18.667 --> 01:12:20.223
Sorry about the mess,
we were just...

01:12:20.351 --> 01:12:21.622
- No problem, no problem.
- I gotta get...

01:12:21.665 --> 01:12:23.015
- these two off to school.
- Okay.

01:12:23.322 --> 01:12:25.721
Girls, let's go.
Out of these pajamas.

01:12:31.258 --> 01:12:33.453
- Robert, nice to meet you.
- Oh, my pleasure.

01:12:33.975 --> 01:12:35.772
- Sit down, come here.
- Yeah.

01:12:37.403 --> 01:12:39.380
- You all right?
- Yeah!

01:12:43.425 --> 01:12:45.236
You've got a beautiful family.

01:12:45.444 --> 01:12:47.420
Thanks. What's going on?

01:12:52.191 --> 01:12:55.410
I took this off the guy

01:12:55.673 --> 01:12:57.580
who tried to kill me yesterday.

01:12:57.710 --> 01:12:59.721
Just like you said,
they're cleaning up.

01:13:00.145 --> 01:13:02.100
Everybody's looking
to the Brussels hit.

01:13:02.181 --> 01:13:04.849
Nobody's safe.
You, your family.

01:13:05.452 --> 01:13:08.286
Nobody. That's
military-grade encryption.

01:13:08.548 --> 01:13:11.816
You should take it to the office,
run the numbers and uh...

01:13:12.011 --> 01:13:14.698
Check the names against the
passenger manifest

01:13:14.762 --> 01:13:18.199
in and out of Brussels in the
days surrounding the flight.

01:13:18.269 --> 01:13:20.990
Whoever we're looking for
may call through that phone.

01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:22.816
I'm on it. I'm on it.

01:13:52.511 --> 01:13:54.447
Tell me I'm wrong, Dave.

01:13:56.449 --> 01:13:58.303
You gonna answer it?

01:14:03.707 --> 01:14:05.647
What happened, Dave?

01:14:11.507 --> 01:14:13.033
You died.

01:14:20.676 --> 01:14:22.260
That's what happened.

01:14:25.224 --> 01:14:28.560
Three months after you
disappeared,

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.690
the government shut us down.

01:14:32.231 --> 01:14:34.220
I went private right after.

01:14:36.355 --> 01:14:39.206
Doing the same things you and
I did for God and country.

01:14:39.290 --> 01:14:42.372
Killing names on a piece
of paper. Only now...

01:14:42.804 --> 01:14:44.615
Now there's
a price next to them.

01:14:44.673 --> 01:14:47.685
- We killed the enemy.
- Who said they were the enemy?

01:14:48.118 --> 01:14:49.943
Not us, not me.

01:14:52.086 --> 01:14:53.757
We just followed orders.

01:14:57.202 --> 01:15:00.824
Mac, there are no good
and bad people.

01:15:00.874 --> 01:15:02.337
Any more, no.

01:15:02.502 --> 01:15:05.951
No enemies, just...

01:15:07.302 --> 01:15:09.020
Unfortunates.

01:15:09.275 --> 01:15:10.830
And Susan?

01:15:13.325 --> 01:15:14.794
Unfortunate.

01:15:19.431 --> 01:15:23.928
No one knew the Brussels contract
was a deep agency asset.

01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:29.340
Susan was gonna figure out
who was in that dining room.

01:15:29.483 --> 01:15:31.996
She was the only one
who could have, right?

01:15:32.511 --> 01:15:35.149
Until you crawled
out of your grave.

01:15:40.106 --> 01:15:42.116
Did you get the chocolate?

01:15:42.806 --> 01:15:44.106
Yeah?

01:16:04.501 --> 01:16:07.214
Susan worked in a
dangerous world, Mac.

01:16:09.287 --> 01:16:11.191
Coulda happened anytime
by anybody.

01:16:11.255 --> 01:16:12.549
It wasn't anybody, it was you.

01:16:12.589 --> 01:16:13.933
Just...

01:16:18.628 --> 01:16:21.078
You spare me the righteous
bullshit, all right?

01:16:23.508 --> 01:16:25.744
You do what you have to do
and you move on.

01:16:25.914 --> 01:16:28.251
There's no movin' on
from this, Dave.

01:16:28.663 --> 01:16:30.237
- We all gotta pay for our sins.
- Oh, yeah?

01:16:30.262 --> 01:16:32.321
What about you? Do you
deserve to die for yours?

01:16:32.355 --> 01:16:33.621
A hundred times over.

01:16:33.719 --> 01:16:35.241
Oh, all right.

01:16:35.382 --> 01:16:37.437
Well, guess what?

01:16:37.579 --> 01:16:39.324
There is no sin.

01:16:42.271 --> 01:16:43.787
No virtue.

01:16:46.271 --> 01:16:48.879
There's just shit people do.

01:16:51.168 --> 01:16:53.329
They trained us to kill people.

01:16:54.021 --> 01:16:55.569
And risk our lives doing it.

01:16:55.683 --> 01:16:57.487
And then one day,
you get a call saying,

01:16:57.578 --> 01:16:59.681
They're done with you.
Thank you for your service.

01:16:59.788 --> 01:17:01.365
Here's a plaque.

01:17:01.509 --> 01:17:03.439
You need a job?
Good luck.

01:17:03.695 --> 01:17:06.535
Need medical insurance?
See the V.A.

01:17:10.265 --> 01:17:11.849
One day, you're an asset.

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:14.797
The next, you're a
fucking afterthought.

01:17:19.351 --> 01:17:22.156
It was a natural evolution.
It's who we were.

01:17:23.421 --> 01:17:25.629
It's what we did.
It's what you did.

01:17:26.362 --> 01:17:28.003
Now it's what we do.

01:17:28.074 --> 01:17:29.268
We?

01:17:31.136 --> 01:17:32.903
It's not just me, Mac.

01:17:35.219 --> 01:17:36.497
It's all of us.

01:17:36.597 --> 01:17:39.678
Ari, Resnik, Kovac.
All of us.

01:17:41.434 --> 01:17:42.917
Family?

01:18:03.061 --> 01:18:04.284
Gentlemen.

01:18:04.434 --> 01:18:05.875
Mac.

01:18:06.159 --> 01:18:08.084
Looks pretty good
for a dead guy.

01:18:09.383 --> 01:18:11.798
We all want you to know,
none of this is uh...

01:18:11.855 --> 01:18:13.233
personal.

01:18:14.526 --> 01:18:16.990
What you do, what you
become is not my concern.

01:18:17.054 --> 01:18:19.959
The world is full of
so-called men like you.

01:18:20.023 --> 01:18:22.062
And in a perfect world,

01:18:22.197 --> 01:18:25.138
everything we do
comes with a price, but...

01:18:25.991 --> 01:18:28.757
This ain't a perfect world.
People do bad things.

01:18:29.131 --> 01:18:31.744
If you're lucky,
you get a chance to...

01:18:32.085 --> 01:18:34.648
set it right. But...

01:18:35.013 --> 01:18:37.257
Most of the time,
it goes unpunished.

01:18:39.011 --> 01:18:40.945
This ain't one of them times.

01:18:41.105 --> 01:18:43.577
The mistake you made
was you killed my friend.

01:18:43.706 --> 01:18:47.066
So, I'm gonna kill
each and every one of you.

01:18:47.319 --> 01:18:49.012
And the only disappointment
in it for me is that

01:18:49.097 --> 01:18:51.143
I only get to do it once.

01:18:54.473 --> 01:18:56.987
- Hey, Ari, fellas!
- Hey, Carol.

01:18:57.087 --> 01:18:58.436
Robert, hope to see you again!

01:18:58.522 --> 01:19:00.169
Nice to meet you, too!

01:19:01.427 --> 01:19:02.592
Uh...

01:19:03.046 --> 01:19:06.540
Dave said you could give me
a lift to the uh, station?

01:19:07.045 --> 01:19:09.013
- Bye, Daddy!
- Bye, Dad!

01:19:09.061 --> 01:19:11.689
Help and company?
Let's go!

01:19:12.994 --> 01:19:15.581
See? Help and company.

01:19:16.404 --> 01:19:17.689
You take the little ones.

01:19:17.812 --> 01:19:19.232
Okay.

01:19:24.333 --> 01:19:25.449
Come on.

01:19:32.167 --> 01:19:33.624
See you at work.

01:19:49.493 --> 01:19:52.169
Look, I don't think
my wife had a favorite.

01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:55.933
She never gave
who I thought to close.

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:00.577
I'm fine.

01:20:00.656 --> 01:20:02.574
I'll bring something over
in the morning.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.059
Who's comin' after me?

01:22:23.143 --> 01:22:25.022
The man who killed Susan.

01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:28.786
Why?

01:22:30.349 --> 01:22:32.145
Because you're a loose end.

01:23:03.461 --> 01:23:04.752
What's up, Miles?

01:23:04.872 --> 01:23:06.676
Hey, yo, what up, man?

01:23:07.041 --> 01:23:08.132
Where are you?

01:23:08.202 --> 01:23:09.992
Yeah, I'm at your crib, actually.

01:23:10.076 --> 01:23:11.677
All right, listen, son.
I don't have time right...

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:13.559
Finishing up these walls.

01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:15.212
Going with the spearmint green.

01:23:15.449 --> 01:23:18.010
Yo, you got any food
around here? I'm starving.

01:23:25.634 --> 01:23:27.659
What's all that barking?

01:23:27.908 --> 01:23:30.166
Go to the window,
tell me what you see.

01:23:30.290 --> 01:23:31.558
Yeah.

01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:35.149
Yeah, these dogs outside
goin' crazy.

01:23:35.203 --> 01:23:38.400
Listen, hey, out toward the street,
tell me what you see.

01:23:39.402 --> 01:23:42.065
Oh, it's just some dude
out here delivering pizza.

01:23:42.606 --> 01:23:43.904
Hang on.

01:24:13.696 --> 01:24:15.269
Hey, yo...

01:24:16.234 --> 01:24:17.826
Yo, Mr. McCall?

01:24:19.423 --> 01:24:20.560
Shit.

01:24:22.373 --> 01:24:23.593
Oh, shit.

01:24:25.034 --> 01:24:27.066
Hey, Mr. McCall, I think
somebody's tryin' to get in...

01:24:27.138 --> 01:24:28.755
Miles, listen to me real carefully.

01:24:28.798 --> 01:24:29.800
Go to the bedroom.

01:24:29.842 --> 01:24:31.795
Go to my bedroom,
you'll see a bookshelf.

01:24:31.852 --> 01:24:32.961
- Go.
- What?

01:24:33.011 --> 01:24:34.048
Just go.

01:24:34.175 --> 01:24:35.539
- Hey, yo, what?
- Miles...

01:24:35.745 --> 01:24:37.236
- Aight.
- Miles...

01:24:37.343 --> 01:24:38.465
See it?

01:24:38.565 --> 01:24:40.390
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:24:40.458 --> 01:24:42.961
Middle shelf, there's a book
by Richard Wright,

01:24:43.003 --> 01:24:44.438
- <i>Native Son.</i>
- What?

01:24:44.474 --> 01:24:46.179
Listen, just do
what I tell you.

01:24:46.214 --> 01:24:47.478
- <i>Native Son, Native Son...</i>
- Just pull it out.

01:24:47.541 --> 01:24:49.104
- What, you want me to read it?
- Pull the book out.

01:24:49.162 --> 01:24:50.667
You'll see a button behind it.

01:24:50.724 --> 01:24:52.524
I want you to push the button.

01:24:59.056 --> 01:25:00.888
You're gonna push the button,
it'll open up.

01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:02.948
You go inside, you close
the door behind you.

01:25:05.610 --> 01:25:06.918
Aight.

01:25:10.171 --> 01:25:11.485
I'm in, I'm in.

01:25:36.481 --> 01:25:37.858
Yo, what is this place?

01:25:37.930 --> 01:25:39.538
All right, calm down,
calm down.

01:25:39.584 --> 01:25:41.602
Just sit down, be quiet.

01:25:41.673 --> 01:25:43.627
Be very quiet, don't move.

01:25:50.867 --> 01:25:52.202
Hey, Mr. McCall...

01:25:53.273 --> 01:25:54.608
Yo, who are these people?

01:25:54.674 --> 01:25:55.973
Let me worry about that.

01:26:08.564 --> 01:26:09.881
Clear.

01:26:25.426 --> 01:26:28.161
Calm down. Get in the hole.
Go inside.

01:26:28.242 --> 01:26:29.461
Aight.

01:26:31.369 --> 01:26:33.907
Yo, man, I don't do well
in small spaces, man.

01:26:34.345 --> 01:26:37.252
- Yo, I can't even breathe.
- Son, son, slow down.

01:26:37.350 --> 01:26:40.299
My fuckin' lungs is...
closin' up and shit.

01:26:54.459 --> 01:26:55.993
He's lookin' right at me.

01:26:56.043 --> 01:26:58.117
Don't worry about it.
It's a two-way mirror.

01:26:58.273 --> 01:26:59.928
You can see them,
they can't see you.

01:27:00.072 --> 01:27:01.796
It's too dark in here.

01:27:01.925 --> 01:27:04.111
Yo, I can't even feel my legs,
I can't see my feet.

01:27:04.145 --> 01:27:07.142
Relax, just breathe.
Don't talk too loud.

01:27:12.082 --> 01:27:14.724
Turn your phone off, they'll
see the light. Turn it off.

01:27:15.123 --> 01:27:16.365
Fuck.

01:27:21.101 --> 01:27:22.311
Fuck.

01:28:12.693 --> 01:28:14.165
How you doing, Dave?

01:28:14.952 --> 01:28:16.424
You know who it is.

01:28:16.722 --> 01:28:18.320
Listen, since
you're in my house,

01:28:18.349 --> 01:28:19.968
water my plants
for me, will you?

01:28:20.010 --> 01:28:21.850
'Cause I'm not gonna be
back for a while.

01:28:33.876 --> 01:28:36.154
It's a mistake to go to war
with us, McCall.

01:28:36.461 --> 01:28:39.430
You got it backwards, Dave.
You're going to war with me.

01:28:42.121 --> 01:28:43.830
You know where I'll be.

01:29:20.288 --> 01:29:21.921
I know where he's headed.

01:29:24.999 --> 01:29:26.829
He's goin' home.

01:30:34.152 --> 01:30:35.647
Hey, kid.

01:30:37.674 --> 01:30:38.944
Back up.

01:30:54.811 --> 01:30:56.032
The town's evacuated!

01:30:56.068 --> 01:30:57.929
How you doin', officer?
Just got off a double shift.

01:30:57.986 --> 01:30:59.662
Just gonna check and
see if I left my gas on.

01:30:59.726 --> 01:31:01.061
All right, make it quick.

01:31:02.406 --> 01:31:04.498
Let the gray BMW through.

01:31:04.683 --> 01:31:05.983
Copy that.

01:32:03.194 --> 01:32:04.693
What do we have here?

01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:12.854
I need you to turn around.
Town's been evacuated.

01:32:48.361 --> 01:32:50.054
Where are you?

01:33:02.393 --> 01:33:03.825
Slow down.

01:33:10.368 --> 01:33:12.366
That was his wife's bakery.

01:33:12.792 --> 01:33:14.021
Go.

01:33:18.206 --> 01:33:19.736
Pull over here.

01:33:37.309 --> 01:33:40.441
Clear the alley.
Mac's house is back there.

01:33:58.106 --> 01:34:00.017
Makin' entry. Yellow house.

01:34:02.527 --> 01:34:04.348
All clear. Comin' out.

01:34:17.275 --> 01:34:19.043
Taking high ground.

01:35:06.900 --> 01:35:08.589
I got movement, 12:00.

01:35:10.166 --> 01:35:11.452
Kovac, move in.

01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:14.839
Ari, what's your sitrep?

01:35:15.074 --> 01:35:16.658
Locking down south side.

01:35:29.032 --> 01:35:31.091
Makin' entry, north side.

01:37:01.648 --> 01:37:03.637
Kovac! Kovac!

01:37:04.645 --> 01:37:06.322
Kovac! Come back.

01:37:06.599 --> 01:37:09.162
Shots fired, shots fired.
I'm goin' in.

01:37:09.284 --> 01:37:10.569
Goin' in!

01:37:11.158 --> 01:37:12.466
York, you got eyes on him?

01:37:12.543 --> 01:37:14.070
I see him.

01:37:23.174 --> 01:37:25.099
Making entry, north side.

01:37:26.714 --> 01:37:27.968
Fuck!

01:37:36.702 --> 01:37:38.165
Ah, fuck!

01:37:39.283 --> 01:37:41.880
- Kovac's down. He's gone.
- Say again.

01:37:42.170 --> 01:37:44.508
Kovac! He's down!
He's fucked!

01:37:45.409 --> 01:37:47.803
Push towards the ocean.

01:37:47.901 --> 01:37:50.259
Repeat. Push towards
the ocean.

01:38:34.505 --> 01:38:36.410
What the fuck?

01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:20.279
Ari? Resnik?

01:39:20.414 --> 01:39:22.233
Somebody talk to me.

01:39:22.595 --> 01:39:23.994
Ari!

01:39:25.557 --> 01:39:27.090
Son of a bitch!

01:39:37.525 --> 01:39:39.021
Ari is down!

01:39:39.455 --> 01:39:40.769
Ari is down!

01:39:40.931 --> 01:39:42.601
Just like the fucking
rest of them!

01:39:44.740 --> 01:39:46.886
There're pictures of
Susan everywhere!

01:39:47.010 --> 01:39:48.807
Picking us apart, man!

01:39:49.569 --> 01:39:51.138
I need fuckin' eyes!

01:40:45.118 --> 01:40:47.768
I'm in the southwest corner
of the yellow building.

01:40:47.836 --> 01:40:49.030
I got a blood trail.

01:40:49.102 --> 01:40:50.956
Looks like he's headed
across the main drag.

01:40:51.028 --> 01:40:52.405
Rear of the bakery.

01:40:52.764 --> 01:40:54.087
Copy that.

01:41:57.476 --> 01:42:00.050
Move inside, Resnik.
Move inside.

01:42:52.493 --> 01:42:54.155
Resnik, do you copy?

01:42:55.774 --> 01:42:57.109
Resnik?

01:42:57.876 --> 01:42:59.283
Come back!

01:43:13.375 --> 01:43:14.639
Fuck!

01:43:28.450 --> 01:43:30.339
Just me and you, Dave.
Nobody's left.

01:43:30.666 --> 01:43:32.312
Not exactly.

01:43:42.291 --> 01:43:44.272
Remember what you taught me.

01:43:44.855 --> 01:43:47.398
Always have
a contingency plan.

01:43:54.028 --> 01:43:55.420
Come on, Mac!

01:43:56.774 --> 01:43:58.189
Show yourself.

01:44:22.303 --> 01:44:24.343
I don't know
who the kid is, Mac.

01:44:24.399 --> 01:44:26.090
Or if he means anything to you.

01:44:26.781 --> 01:44:29.101
I took the chance
that he matters.

01:44:31.026 --> 01:44:33.008
I'll make it simple.
Step out.

01:44:33.082 --> 01:44:35.870
Show yourself
and I won't kill the kid.

01:44:49.044 --> 01:44:51.147
The wind makes it interesting.

01:44:53.037 --> 01:44:54.449
Side mirror.

01:44:56.630 --> 01:44:59.605
Two more. Third one goes
to the middle of the trunk.

01:45:07.236 --> 01:45:08.561
Tail light.

01:45:11.054 --> 01:45:13.746
I was a hair off on that one.
I might've hit the kid.

01:45:19.725 --> 01:45:22.560
All right! Time's up, Mac!

01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:36.374
Nice move, Mac.

01:45:36.945 --> 01:45:38.817
But it's not gonna
make any difference.

01:45:41.939 --> 01:45:44.009
Where are you?
You son of a bitch!

01:46:15.089 --> 01:46:16.744
Fuck you, Mac!

01:46:17.626 --> 01:46:19.267
Fuck you!

01:46:19.714 --> 01:46:21.478
You couldn't save your wife!

01:46:21.739 --> 01:46:23.784
You couldn't save Susan!

01:46:24.159 --> 01:46:26.809
And you're not gonna save
this fuckin' kid!

01:46:27.717 --> 01:46:29.558
Is that in your playbook?

01:46:29.629 --> 01:46:32.193
Is that in your
fucking playbook?

01:46:32.381 --> 01:46:34.242
Show yourself!

01:48:23.178 --> 01:48:24.392
All right.

01:48:25.084 --> 01:48:26.346
Right here.

01:48:26.807 --> 01:48:28.270
Sit down right here.

01:48:52.132 --> 01:48:53.460
Here you go.

01:48:54.284 --> 01:48:55.463
Let's see.

01:48:58.559 --> 01:49:00.312
Yeah, it went in and out.

01:49:00.534 --> 01:49:01.855
It's not bad.

01:49:05.454 --> 01:49:06.897
- Hey, yo...
- Yeah?

01:49:07.210 --> 01:49:09.120
My moms is gonna be pissed.

01:49:09.180 --> 01:49:10.853
Yeah, I'll talk to her.

01:49:11.770 --> 01:49:13.333
Yo, not a me, man.

01:49:13.473 --> 01:49:15.633
- At you.
- You talk to her, then.

01:49:15.740 --> 01:49:16.948
All right.

01:49:17.345 --> 01:49:19.028
Count to three.
One, two,

01:49:19.071 --> 01:49:20.463
- three.
- Three.

01:49:22.984 --> 01:49:24.880
- It's all good.
- Yep.

01:49:24.973 --> 01:49:26.159
I got your back.

01:49:26.251 --> 01:49:27.515
Appreciate it.

01:49:28.467 --> 01:49:31.083
- Hey, Mr. McCall.
- Yeah.

01:49:32.482 --> 01:49:34.078
Who are you, man?

01:50:29.310 --> 01:50:31.419
- Hey, Mr. McCall.
- Yeah.

01:50:32.136 --> 01:50:33.926
I think the bleedin' stopped.

01:50:34.456 --> 01:50:36.277
Well, good, good.

01:50:40.754 --> 01:50:41.966
Sit down.

01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:43.805
This your place?

01:50:44.134 --> 01:50:45.446
Yes, it is.

01:50:46.267 --> 01:50:47.541
Come on, sit down.

01:51:35.664 --> 01:51:37.375
What are you drawing?

01:51:39.648 --> 01:51:41.438
I'm uh...

01:51:42.710 --> 01:51:45.054
Workin' on a
superhero character.

01:51:45.998 --> 01:51:48.498
- What's his power?
- What's his power?

01:51:50.001 --> 01:51:52.113
He knows things
before you do.

01:51:52.850 --> 01:51:54.521
He has uh...

01:51:54.720 --> 01:51:57.604
secret rooms, magic locks.

01:51:58.161 --> 01:51:59.947
You know, shit like that.

01:52:00.097 --> 01:52:02.085
St-Stuff like that.

01:52:02.551 --> 01:52:03.939
He fly?

01:52:04.730 --> 01:52:05.863
Nah.

01:52:06.026 --> 01:52:08.903
He actu-actually drives a Malibu.

01:52:09.450 --> 01:52:10.985
That's funny?

01:52:11.776 --> 01:52:14.095
Honestly?
That's cool.

01:52:15.058 --> 01:52:16.287
I love it.

01:52:16.386 --> 01:52:18.446
Respect. I appreciate that.

01:52:57.853 --> 01:53:00.371
So, so, you can understand

01:53:00.741 --> 01:53:03.589
that when a resident uh, says

01:53:04.051 --> 01:53:08.326
things that are um,
grandiose by nature,

01:53:10.172 --> 01:53:12.324
we tend to dismiss it.

01:53:12.744 --> 01:53:14.853
So, you can imagine how um...

01:53:15.298 --> 01:53:17.658
surprised we were today when

01:53:17.822 --> 01:53:19.533
uh, when um...

01:53:19.734 --> 01:53:22.437
If you could just give
me a moment, okay?

01:53:42.593 --> 01:53:44.335
Hi, Sammy?

01:53:50.628 --> 01:53:51.835
Oh!

01:53:52.630 --> 01:53:54.335
Magda!
