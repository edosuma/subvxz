00:34.833 --> 00:35.734
HEY.

00:35.801 --> 00:38.302
HI, HONEY.
WHAT'S IN THE BAG?

00:38.370 --> 00:41.039
OH, JUST SOME LEFTOVER CAKE
THE GUYS SURPRISED ME WITH TODAY

00:41.107 --> 00:45.476
'CAUSE IT'S, UH... MY
TENTH ANNIVERSARY AT I.P.S.

00:45.544 --> 00:47.528
WOW! REALLY?

00:47.596 --> 00:50.048
YEP. I'VE BEEN IN A MEDIOCRE
JOB FOR A REAL LONG TIME.

00:50.115 --> 00:52.150
GIVE IT UP!

00:52.217 --> 00:53.385
I GOTTA SAY,
BETWEEN THAT

00:53.453 --> 00:56.188
AND NOT FINISHING THE
CAKE ON THE DRIVE HOME,

00:56.255 --> 00:58.290
YOU'VE GOT A LOT TO
BE PROUD OF, MY FRIEND.

01:01.794 --> 01:04.062
WAIT, TODAY'S YOUR
TENTH ANNIVERSARY?

01:04.129 --> 01:07.332
SHOULDN'T IT HAVE BEEN,
LIKE, 3 MONTHS AGO?

01:07.400 --> 01:10.868
UH... NO.
NO, IT'S TODAY.

01:10.936 --> 01:12.387
CAKE DOES NOT LIE,
YOU KNOW?

01:12.455 --> 01:13.888
UNLESS IT'S
YOUR BIRTHDAY CAKE.

01:13.956 --> 01:16.324
THAT BABY'S SEEN 29 CANDLES
MORE THAN ONCE, AM I RIGHT?

01:16.392 --> 01:18.960
HA HA HA!
I THINK I AM.

01:19.027 --> 01:23.148
NO, NO. I REMEMBER EXACTLY
WHEN YOU STARTED AT I.P.S.

01:23.215 --> 01:25.049
BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN
WE STARTED DATING-

01:25.117 --> 01:26.668
SUMMER OF '95.

01:26.736 --> 01:28.202
REMEMBER,
YOU DIDN'T SHOWER MUCH

01:28.270 --> 01:30.338
'CAUSE YOU SAID
YOU WERE GRUNGE?

01:30.406 --> 01:33.108
TODAY, 3 MONTHS AGO
- WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE, REALLY?

01:33.175 --> 01:34.726
THERE'S A BIG
DIFFERENCE, DOUG, OK?

01:34.793 --> 01:36.495
A LOT OF PENSION AND
BENEFITS STUFF KICKS IN

01:36.562 --> 01:37.862
AT THE 10-YEAR MARK,

01:37.930 --> 01:40.465
WHICH MEANS I.P.S.
IS 3 MONTHS BEHIND.

01:40.533 --> 01:42.234
I'M GONNA LEAVE A
MESSAGE FOR ACCOUNTING.

01:42.301 --> 01:44.669
UH, YOU KNOW, THAT'S OK. I'LL
JUST-I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT TOMORROW.

01:44.737 --> 01:46.371
NAH.
YOU'LL NEVER DO IT.

01:47.656 --> 01:50.057
LET ME TELL YOU
A STORY.

01:52.795 --> 01:54.962
COME ON, I THOUGHT IT
WAS A REALLY GOOD MOVIE.

01:55.030 --> 01:56.564
YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK
IT SHOULD'VE BEEN CALLED

01:56.632 --> 01:58.283
WAITING TO EXHALE
INTO MY HAND.

01:58.351 --> 02:00.085
PFFFFFT!

02:01.153 --> 02:02.721
I LOVE
WHEN YOU DO THAT.

02:04.306 --> 02:06.340
I HAD A REALLY
GREAT TIME TONIGHT.

02:06.408 --> 02:07.976
ME, TOO.

02:15.768 --> 02:17.469
SO, UH...

02:17.536 --> 02:18.837
WHAT NOW?

02:20.305 --> 02:22.140
SO, NOW YOU GO HOME.

02:22.208 --> 02:24.942
OH, COME ON, WE'VE BEEN GOING
OUT FOR, LIKE, 2 MONTHS, CARRIE.

02:25.010 --> 02:27.812
MY WHOLE BODY'S BLUE.

02:36.856 --> 02:39.824
I GOTTA GET UP EARLY
FOR WORK TOMORROW.

02:39.892 --> 02:42.110
JUST CALL IN SICK.
TELL THEM YOU CAME DOWN

02:42.178 --> 02:46.080
WITH A BAD CASE
OF DOUG-ONUCLEOSIS.

02:46.148 --> 02:47.282
GOOD NIGHT, DOUG.

02:52.971 --> 02:54.772
MMM.

02:54.840 --> 02:55.723
COME ON!

02:55.791 --> 02:57.324
GOOD NIGHT, DOUG.

03:01.530 --> 03:03.264
OK...

03:15.911 --> 03:18.613
HEY, GUYS, BEFORE I SIT
DOWN, YOU SHOULD BOTH KNOW

03:18.681 --> 03:21.215
<i>I HAVEN'T SEEN LAST
NIGHT'S MELROSE PLACE YET,</i>

03:21.283 --> 03:22.367
SO IF ANYONE
SAYS ANYTHING,

03:22.435 --> 03:23.968
I WILL
OFFICIALLY FREAK.

03:24.036 --> 03:26.387
AH, DOUG, I HATE
TO BRING IT UP NOW,

03:26.455 --> 03:28.289
BUT YOUR TAB,
IT'S RUNNING KIND OF HIGH.

03:28.357 --> 03:31.609
I CAN'T PAY A TAB IF I
DON'T HAVE A JOB, EINSTEIN.

03:31.676 --> 03:33.294
WELL, WE'RE HIRING
DOWN IN THE SUBWAY.

03:33.362 --> 03:34.729
THANKS, BUT I'M
HOLDING OUT FOR A JOB

03:34.797 --> 03:36.664
THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE
WALKING THROUGH URINE.

03:36.732 --> 03:38.916
OH, LA-DI-DA.

03:38.984 --> 03:42.052
SO, HOW ARE THINGS GOING
WITH THE NEW LADY?

03:42.120 --> 03:45.006
OH, CARRIE? GREAT. SHE'S SO
SWEET. GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR.

03:45.074 --> 03:46.807
WHEN I MAKE
MY BELLY BUTTON TALK,

03:46.876 --> 03:49.110
SHE REALLY GETS IT.

03:49.178 --> 03:51.096
AND HOW IS EVERYTHING IN...
HORIZONTAL TOWN?

03:51.163 --> 03:54.198
OH, COME ON. I DON'T LIKE TO TALK
ABOUT THAT KIND OF STUFF, ALL RIGHT?

03:54.266 --> 03:56.634
<i>OH, COME ON. I NEED SOMETHING
TO KEEP MY MIND OFF MELROSE.</i>

03:56.702 --> 03:59.270
ALL RIGHT,
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY-

03:59.338 --> 04:01.339
NOT TO GET TOO GRAPHIC-

04:01.407 --> 04:04.058
BUT I'VE GOTTEN MORE
OFF OF YOU TWO.

04:04.126 --> 04:07.111
HA HA HA! WHOA! MAN!

04:07.179 --> 04:09.380
AND YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN GOING
OUT FOR, LIKE, 2 MONTHS, RIGHT?

04:09.448 --> 04:10.949
IT'S A LITTLE ROUGH,
BUT CARRIE WANTS TO WAIT.

04:11.016 --> 04:14.953
AND I RESPECT THE FACT THAT
CARRIE'S A GOOD GIRL, YOU KNOW?

04:16.971 --> 04:18.490
WHAT WAS THAT?

04:18.557 --> 04:19.357
WHAT?

04:21.010 --> 04:22.376
WHAT'S GOING ON
HERE?

04:22.444 --> 04:25.096
WELL, WORD ON THE STREET
IS THAT WAITING...

04:25.164 --> 04:26.831
ISN'T CARRIE'S THING.

04:26.898 --> 04:28.732
YOU WATCH YOUR MOUTH. I SWEAR TO
GOD, I'LL CUT YOU 8 DIFFERENT WAYS.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.368
IT'S TRUE!
YEAH?

04:30.436 --> 04:32.270
WHO'S SHE BEEN WITH?
GIVE ME ONE NAME.

04:32.338 --> 04:33.520
SAL DeROBERTIS.

04:33.588 --> 04:35.757
SAL? I THOUGHT IT WAS
HIS BROTHER JOHNNY.

04:35.824 --> 04:38.043
<i>SAL AND JOHNNY.
HE ONLY ASKED FOR ONE NAME.</i>

04:38.110 --> 04:39.577
YOU GUYS DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, ALL RIGHT?

04:39.645 --> 04:42.413
SHE'S A GOOD GIRL, AND SHE
WANTS TO WAIT, AND THAT'S IT!

04:42.481 --> 04:44.382
<i>OK.
IT IS "OK." YEAH.</i>

04:44.450 --> 04:46.318
<i>AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?
HERE'S A MELROSE UPDATE-</i>

04:46.385 --> 04:47.519
YEAH, ALLISON
GOT AMANDA'S JOB

04:47.586 --> 04:48.520
AND SLEPT WITH BILLY
IN HER OFFICE.

04:48.587 --> 04:50.121
YEAH!

05:03.135 --> 05:04.635
UH... OW!

05:04.703 --> 05:06.187
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:06.254 --> 05:08.489
I'M SORRY. YOU LOOKED
UNCOMFORTABLE,

05:08.557 --> 05:09.924
SO I THOUGHT, UH...

05:09.992 --> 05:13.227
YOU THOUGHT I'D BE MORE
COMFORTABLE WITHOUT A BRA?

05:13.295 --> 05:15.346
<i>I KNOW I AM.</i>

05:15.414 --> 05:16.097
COME ON.

05:16.165 --> 05:17.715
DOUG, COME ON.
LOOK, I TOLD YOU,

05:17.783 --> 05:19.751
I'M JUST
NOT READY YET, OK?

05:19.818 --> 05:22.286
I'M SORRY.
THAT'S JUST THE WAY I AM.

05:22.354 --> 05:24.689
YEAH, THAT'S
THE BOOK ON YOU.

05:27.125 --> 05:29.226
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?

05:29.294 --> 05:30.762
NOTHING. IT'S JUST...
I DON'T KNOW.

05:30.830 --> 05:33.197
I JUST HEARD THAT BRA USED
TO COME OFF A LITTLE EASIER.

05:33.265 --> 05:35.467
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN'?
LIKE, BING!

05:36.602 --> 05:40.237
ARE YOU CALLING ME A-
A SLUT?

05:40.305 --> 05:43.508
NOT ME.
SPENCE AND DANNY.

05:43.576 --> 05:44.575
LIKE THEY KNOW ME.

05:44.643 --> 05:46.010
THEY KNOW
THE DeROBERTIS BROTHERS

05:46.078 --> 05:48.846
AND APPARENTLY,
SO DO YOU.

05:48.914 --> 05:50.698
YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S
REALLY NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

05:50.765 --> 05:52.066
OH, COME-IT IS
MY BUSINESS, CARRIE.

05:52.134 --> 05:53.367
IF YOU WON'T SLEEP
WITH ME, YOU KNOW,

05:53.435 --> 05:56.087
BUT YOU'LL SLEEP WITH HALF
THE DeROBERTIS-IS-IS.

05:57.606 --> 05:59.641
MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE
THEY WERE SMART ENOUGH

05:59.708 --> 06:01.409
<i>TO FIGURE OUT
AFTER AN HOUR</i>

06:01.477 --> 06:04.345
THAT MY BRA OPENS
IN THE FRONT!

06:04.413 --> 06:07.248
OK, YOU WEAR A BRA THAT OPENS IN THE
FRONT, BUT YOU'RE NOT A SLUT. RIGHT.

06:07.316 --> 06:09.583
YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:09.651 --> 06:10.852
YOU BETTER BACK OFF
THE SLUT THING,

06:10.919 --> 06:11.953
OR YOU'RE GONNA
FIND YOURSELF

06:12.021 --> 06:14.856
IN THE TRUNK
OF GINO DeROBERTIS' CAR.

06:14.923 --> 06:18.059
GINO? YOU SLEPT
WITH THE UNCLE ALSO?!

06:18.127 --> 06:20.728
THEY'RE
A NICE FAMILY, OK?

06:20.795 --> 06:22.664
CARRIE, WHAT THE HELL'S
GOIN' ON HERE?!

06:22.731 --> 06:24.699
ALL RIGHT,
MAYBE I HOOKED UP

06:24.766 --> 06:27.068
WITH A LOT MORE GUYS THAN
I SHOULD'VE, ALL RIGHT?

06:27.136 --> 06:28.453
I DON'T KNOW
WHY I DID IT.

06:28.520 --> 06:32.256
MAYBE IT'S 'CAUSE MY MOM
DIED, AND MY DAD'S CRAZY.

06:32.324 --> 06:33.825
I HAD A SEPARATE
ENTRANCE TO THE HOUSE.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.293
I DON'T KNOW!

06:35.360 --> 06:37.729
THE POINT IS,

06:37.880 --> 06:40.548
I DON'T WANT TO BE
LIKE THAT ANYMORE, OK?

06:40.615 --> 06:44.252
I WANT TO BE IN A GROWN-UP
RELATIONSHIP WITH ONE GUY,

06:44.320 --> 06:47.172
AND I THINK I WANT
THAT GUY TO BE YOU.

06:47.239 --> 06:49.224
LET ME BE YOUR GROWN-UP.
COME ON, LET'S GO.

06:49.291 --> 06:52.660
NO, DOUG! COME ON!
I JUST TOLD YOU,

06:52.728 --> 06:55.730
I WANNA BE IN A GROWN-UP
RELATIONSHIP. YOU'RE NOT A GROWN-UP.

06:55.797 --> 06:57.498
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

06:57.566 --> 06:58.983
YEAH, YOU DON'T
- YOU DON'T HAVE ANY PLANS,

06:59.051 --> 07:00.585
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY GOALS.

07:00.653 --> 07:01.735
I GOT PLANS.
I GOT LOTS OF GOALS.

07:01.803 --> 07:04.155
OH, OK. YOU DON'T
EVEN HAVE A JOB.

07:04.222 --> 07:06.890
Y- YES, I DO.

07:06.958 --> 07:08.109
WHAT?

07:08.176 --> 07:09.460
I WAS GONNA
SURPRISE YOU...

07:09.528 --> 07:10.861
TOMORROW,
AFTER MY FIRST DAY.

07:10.929 --> 07:13.897
<i>I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT'S
WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT!</i>

07:15.133 --> 07:17.469
WAIT.

07:17.536 --> 07:19.838
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

07:19.905 --> 07:22.206
YES, I'M SERIOUS.

07:24.242 --> 07:27.244
CARRIE,
BEFORE I MET YOU, I-

07:27.312 --> 07:29.614
I JUST LIKED HANGING OUT
AT A PIZZA PLACE,

07:29.682 --> 07:31.349
BUT NOW...

07:31.416 --> 07:33.284
I WANT MORE.

07:36.722 --> 07:38.822

07:38.890 --> 07:41.159
MORE FOR YOU...

07:41.226 --> 07:43.494
more for us.

07:50.252 --> 07:51.919
WAIT, SO...
WHAT'S THE JOB?

07:51.987 --> 07:53.387
SHH.
OK.

07:57.709 --> 07:59.326

08:05.734 --> 08:07.502
I'M THINKING IF I HADN'T DOWNED
ALL THOSE ZIMAS LAST NIGHT,

08:07.569 --> 08:10.238
I'D STAY IN BED
WITH YOU FOREVER.

08:12.157 --> 08:14.258
OH, MY GOD. I'M GONNA
BE LATE FOR WORK.

08:15.894 --> 08:17.561
OH, YEAH.

08:19.898 --> 08:21.132

08:21.200 --> 08:23.634
YEAH.

08:26.138 --> 08:27.438
LATE FOR WHAT?

08:27.505 --> 08:28.973

08:29.041 --> 08:31.008
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

NO.

08:43.572 --> 08:45.423
OH, THAT IS HILARIOUS!

08:48.794 --> 08:50.128
NOW, I GOTTA BE
HONEST WITH YOU,

08:50.195 --> 08:52.546
I HAVE BEEN
FANTASIZING ARCHITECT,

08:52.614 --> 08:54.415
'CAUSE I'VE ALWAYS HAD
A CRUSH ON MR. BRADY,

08:54.483 --> 08:57.785
BUT I'M REALISTIC,
SO- TELL ME.

08:57.853 --> 09:00.304
WELL, IT'S A GOOD JOB.

09:06.011 --> 09:10.114
I WILL TELL YOU IF YOU LET
ME GET A WORD IN EDGEWISE.

09:16.088 --> 09:18.990
OH, MY GOD. YOU DIDN'T
MAKE UP SOME FAKE JOB

09:19.058 --> 09:21.625
JUST SO THAT I WOULD
SLEEP WITH YOU, DID YOU?

09:21.693 --> 09:24.045
DID-WHAT-DID I-
MAKE UP-CARR-

09:24.112 --> 09:26.180
WOW, MY HEAD
IS SPINNING. WHOA.

09:26.247 --> 09:28.249

09:28.317 --> 09:29.917
ALL RIGHT, SO, THEN JUST

09:29.984 --> 09:31.068
OH, YOU WANNA TAKE

YOU JUST LOST THE RIGHT
TO KNOW WHERE I WORK, OK?

09:33.521 --> 09:34.505
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:34.573 --> 09:37.809
WHAT AM I DOING? I'M
GETTING READY FOR MY...

09:37.876 --> 09:40.411
"FAKE JOB"...

09:40.562 --> 09:42.596

OK?

09:46.068 --> 09:49.403
JUST GIVE ME
A COMPANY NAME!

09:49.471 --> 09:51.088
OH, YOU WANT A NAME? IT'S A SMALL
BUSINESS. MAYBE YOU'VE HEARD OF IT?

09:51.156 --> 09:53.557
IT'S CALLED
SHUTTY INDUSTRIES!

09:58.413 --> 10:01.198
SHE EVER ASK THE DeROBERTIS
BOYS IF THEY HAVE JOBS?

10:01.266 --> 10:05.836
NO. BUT I GOTTA HAVE A JOB
'CAUSE I'M NOT A DeROBERTIS.

10:05.904 --> 10:08.589
DeROBERTIS.

10:08.657 --> 10:11.175
IT'S A COOL NAME.

10:11.242 --> 10:13.911
DOUG DeROBERTIS.

10:17.916 --> 10:19.650
OH, MY GOD. SHE'S
FOLLOWING ME.

10:19.718 --> 10:21.919
OH, THIS CHICK
HAS TRUST ISSUES.

10:21.986 --> 10:23.354
OK, JOB, JOB, JOB.

10:23.422 --> 10:25.623
GOTTA FIND A JOB.

10:38.854 --> 10:40.487
THAT WOULDN'T
END WELL.

10:43.292 --> 10:44.692
YEAH.

10:46.728 --> 10:48.062
DAMN IT!

11:07.532 --> 11:08.565
HEY, I, UH, HATE
TO BOTHER YOU,

11:08.633 --> 11:11.035
