WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:01.600
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

00:01.603 --> 00:03.093
I want to break up Firestorm.

00:03.096 --> 00:05.282
If you guys are getting cold feet,
we can call the whole thing off.

00:05.284 --> 00:06.398
It's time for Jefferson

00:06.401 --> 00:09.257
to claim the power of
Firestorm for himself.

00:09.260 --> 00:11.210
This totem is my family's.

00:11.212 --> 00:12.711
Only my blood may bare it.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.446
- And they do.
- That's impossible.

00:14.448 --> 00:16.315
That I am your granddaughter?

00:16.317 --> 00:18.661
Why does Darhk care if we
fix Anachronisms or not?

00:18.664 --> 00:20.452
That's the thing about daughters.

00:20.454 --> 00:22.021
When they see you die at the hands

00:22.023 --> 00:23.922
of one self-righteous hero,

00:23.924 --> 00:25.724
they really don't want
to see it happen again.

00:25.726 --> 00:27.359
We're stronger together. We know thatth

00:27.361 --> 00:28.794
Darhk knows that.

01:44.672 --> 01:46.472
Still nothing.

01:46.474 --> 01:48.207
What are you doing, Grey?

01:48.209 --> 01:50.776
Oh, since...

01:50.778 --> 01:52.544
Gideon took Sara off sedatives,

01:52.546 --> 01:54.580
I've been looking for a salient stimulus

01:54.582 --> 01:56.315
to pull her out of the coma.

01:56.317 --> 01:57.716
What the hell is that?

01:57.718 --> 02:00.319
Salient stimulus: a noise or sound

02:00.321 --> 02:02.855
she might have an
emotional connection to

02:02.857 --> 02:04.423
that would wake her up.

02:04.425 --> 02:06.425
Here, would you like to give it a try?

02:06.427 --> 02:08.494
No, actually, uh,

02:08.496 --> 02:12.164
I was wondering if you needed
help with our other project.

02:12.166 --> 02:14.166
Uncoupling Firestorm?

02:14.168 --> 02:16.368
Oh, oh, yes, yes, that project.

02:16.370 --> 02:18.203
I've been looking into those equations,

02:18.205 --> 02:21.206
and it's very promising, indeed.

02:21.208 --> 02:26.178
All of Firestorm's power
will safely reside in you.

02:26.180 --> 02:27.880
Well, you're the smartest man I know,

02:27.882 --> 02:29.748
so if anybody can
figure it out, it's you.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.251
That's why the smartest man
you know is heading right back

02:32.253 --> 02:34.887
to the lab to double
check his calculations.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.763
Everything okay?

02:44.765 --> 02:47.533
You're hitting the bag like
it's insulting your mother,

02:47.535 --> 02:50.402
and you haven't said
anything for like 30 minutes.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.037
What is there to say?

02:52.039 --> 02:53.305
I don't know.

02:53.307 --> 02:55.304
Talk about your granddaughter?

02:57.645 --> 02:59.645
And not the superhero either.

02:59.647 --> 03:01.113
The psycho water witch.

03:01.115 --> 03:03.549
- The who?
- Your granddaughter.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.384
I mean, I'm sure she's
really not that bad.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.352
You just called her a
"psycho water witch."

03:07.354 --> 03:09.087
Yeah, and I instantly regret it.

03:09.089 --> 03:11.290
I'm sure she's just, you know...

03:11.292 --> 03:13.125
confused.

03:13.127 --> 03:14.893
Well, I'm not.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.929
Kuasa and I will
confront each other again.

03:16.931 --> 03:18.297
It's inevitable.

03:18.299 --> 03:19.932
When we do...

03:19.934 --> 03:21.900
I won't hesitate to stop her,

03:21.902 --> 03:24.870
even if she is my granddaughter.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.371
Okay.

03:26.373 --> 03:28.554
Good talk. Way to get the emotions out.

03:30.611 --> 03:33.212
I really wish I had
better news about Sara,

03:33.214 --> 03:34.847
but she's still in a coma

03:34.849 --> 03:36.648
thanks to Damien Darhk's
daughter laying her out.

03:36.650 --> 03:39.184
Well, in the meantime, we
could do what we do best

03:39.186 --> 03:40.752
and fix a few Anachronisms.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.554
How about you drop me off on an island

03:42.556 --> 03:44.857
full of beautiful women like Zari did

03:44.859 --> 03:46.558
with that Helen chick.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.660
Rory, you weren't
supposed to say anything.

03:48.662 --> 03:51.463
Wait, you didn't take Helen
back to Troy where she belongs?

03:51.465 --> 03:53.699
That's what the Time Bureau does,

03:53.701 --> 03:56.068
but we... we do something different.

03:56.070 --> 03:59.671
No, we do it different... ly.

03:59.673 --> 04:02.074
Yeah, more messy.

04:02.076 --> 04:04.409
Okay, if you look at
the historical record,

04:04.411 --> 04:07.112
the Trojan War happens
with or without Helen.

04:07.114 --> 04:08.747
See? No Anachronism.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.115
How do you think the Captain would feel

04:10.117 --> 04:11.583
about you re-engineering time?

04:11.585 --> 04:13.151
Well, we can argue about that later

04:13.153 --> 04:14.853
because I know exactly what she'd say

04:14.855 --> 04:17.022
if she wakes up and
finds us doing nothing.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.423
We owe it to Sara to keep doing our job.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.070
So where do we start?

04:21.072 --> 04:23.629
Well, I was thinking we'd just

04:23.631 --> 04:27.266
leave it up to chance
and my index finger.

04:28.502 --> 04:29.668
Oof.

04:29.670 --> 04:32.604
Vietnam. 1967.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.507
Also known as the height
of the Vietnam War.

04:35.509 --> 04:36.808
Gideon, what kind of Anachronism

04:36.810 --> 04:37.809
are we dealing with?

04:37.811 --> 04:39.111
A level eight.

04:39.113 --> 04:40.531
Scans of the historical record

04:40.534 --> 04:42.514
reveal redacted Pentagon
reports about a creature

04:42.516 --> 04:44.383
of unknown origin attacking American

04:44.385 --> 04:46.018
and Vietcong soldiers in the jungle.

04:46.020 --> 04:48.287
Dozens have disappeared without a trace.

04:48.289 --> 04:49.855
No way I'm going to 'Nam.

04:49.857 --> 04:51.623
All I know is that if American soldiers

04:51.625 --> 04:53.625
are being targeted, I
am ready to do my duty.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.261
This war's a little different.

04:56.263 --> 04:58.630
Unlike World War II,
the military objectives

04:58.632 --> 05:00.465
in Vietnam weren't so cut and dry.

05:00.467 --> 05:01.898
Yeah, it was controversial,

05:01.901 --> 05:04.503
and the reasons for
getting involved were murky.

05:04.505 --> 05:05.971
You know, come to think about it,

05:05.973 --> 05:08.740
this team should be right at home.

05:20.688 --> 05:22.559
Sole survivor of the
last patrol attacked

05:22.562 --> 05:23.889
was named Ryan Sanders.

05:23.891 --> 05:25.016
He's supposed to be on R and R here.

05:25.018 --> 05:26.141
This doesn't look like a good place

05:26.143 --> 05:28.203
for American Gis to rest and recuperate.

05:28.206 --> 05:30.028
Looks more like they're
just trying to escape.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.164
Hey, I found our guy.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.372
Mr. Sanders.

05:40.374 --> 05:42.507
We're with the Associated Press.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.309
We wanted to ask you a few questions

05:44.311 --> 05:46.845
about what happened with your squad.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.347
I don't want to talk about it.

05:48.349 --> 05:50.182
We won't take up much of your time.

05:50.184 --> 05:52.050
Yeah, people need to hear your story.

05:52.052 --> 05:55.387
You could save lives
telling us what you saw.

05:55.389 --> 05:58.256
It must have stalked
us for several klicks.

05:58.258 --> 05:59.691
Took us by surprise.

05:59.693 --> 06:02.053
Whatever was out there

06:02.056 --> 06:03.695
was pure evil,

06:03.697 --> 06:06.264
and it had a message for us.

06:06.266 --> 06:08.867
Stay out of the jungle.

06:12.906 --> 06:16.174
I hate the jungle. You
sure this is the right way?

06:16.176 --> 06:18.910
Well, according to the field reports,

06:18.912 --> 06:22.581
the last known location
of Alpha Team was right...

06:22.583 --> 06:24.082
here.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.385
I should have stayed in Aruba.

06:26.387 --> 06:29.237
What could have taken out a
whole patrol of US soldiers?

06:29.240 --> 06:30.589
Nothing good.

06:30.591 --> 06:33.959
But this missing squad's
gonna stay missing.

06:33.961 --> 06:37.195
Let's get out of here.

06:37.197 --> 06:39.231
Hope Mick and Nate are
watching their backs.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.433
If what Sanders said is
true, they're in real danger.

06:41.435 --> 06:43.435
Who knows if what he said was true?

06:43.437 --> 06:46.338
- He was clearly intoxicated.
- Forget about him.

06:46.340 --> 06:48.974
I think I found someone who
can tell us what's going on.

06:48.976 --> 06:52.577
Hey, you've been staring
at us since we got here.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.780
I heard you asking about the jungle.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.682
It can be a dangerous place

06:56.684 --> 06:58.628
even if you are carrying a machine gun.

06:58.631 --> 07:00.452
Well, we're journalists here...

07:00.454 --> 07:02.178
Eh. Who the hell are you?

07:02.181 --> 07:04.456
My name is Anh Ly.

07:04.458 --> 07:07.271
And I know what's out in that jungle.

07:07.274 --> 07:09.174
You've seen what's been
attacking these soldiers?

07:09.176 --> 07:10.393
Attacking them?

07:10.396 --> 07:11.763
Come with me.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.633
I won't just tell you what's happening.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.501
I'll show you.

07:16.503 --> 07:18.670
Too many trees.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.205
Too many plants.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.107
We'll be back on concrete in no time.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.682
Bugs!

07:23.685 --> 07:25.444
Flies.

07:25.446 --> 07:28.346
What's going on with you?
You're grumpier than usual.

07:28.348 --> 07:30.584
What? I'm in a good mood.

07:30.587 --> 07:32.317
Is it because I made your boots too big?

07:32.319 --> 07:34.319
Look, I forget you've got small feet,

07:34.321 --> 07:36.321
and why would you not
want to come to Vietnam?

07:36.323 --> 07:39.858
This place was like made for you.

07:39.860 --> 07:42.227
- My dad.
- What about him?

07:42.229 --> 07:44.029
He's here. 'Nam, the war.

07:44.031 --> 07:45.430
Oh, buddy, you don't really think

07:45.432 --> 07:47.065
you're gonna see him, do you?

07:47.067 --> 07:48.934
There's almost no chance we're gonna run

07:48.936 --> 07:50.602
into your father in a jungle this big.

07:50.604 --> 07:51.803
You said, "almost,"

07:51.805 --> 07:53.405
meaning there is a chance.

07:53.407 --> 07:55.373
I'll buy you a six-pack
if we bump into him.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.949
Hands up, pretty boy.

08:05.385 --> 08:07.519
You owe me a six-pack.

08:07.521 --> 08:09.412
No.

08:15.004 --> 08:17.473
Hands up. Now.

08:22.614 --> 08:24.647
Dude, what are you doing?

08:24.649 --> 08:28.356
I'm Operations Officer
Nathaniel Heywood of the CIA.

08:28.359 --> 08:30.653
This is my partner...

08:30.655 --> 08:32.587
Officer Schwarzenegger.

08:32.590 --> 08:35.825
We're here to investigate the
disappearance of Alpha Team.

08:41.131 --> 08:43.332
Can't be too careful.

08:43.335 --> 08:46.069
Sergeant Dick Rory, Echo Team.

08:51.142 --> 08:53.176
I think it's in our mutual best interest

08:53.178 --> 08:54.744
if we conduct this
investigation together,

08:54.746 --> 08:56.145
find out what happened to our men.

08:56.147 --> 08:57.647
Actually, we were just leaving.

08:57.649 --> 08:59.682
Sounds like a plan, but I got to say,

08:59.684 --> 09:02.018
your partner here
doesn't look so gung ho.

09:02.020 --> 09:03.735
Give us a minute.

09:10.528 --> 09:12.562
Look, I'm sorry you
have to see your father,

09:12.564 --> 09:14.297
but you need to suck it up.

09:14.299 --> 09:18.201
If it wasn't for this
time-travelling stuff...

09:18.203 --> 09:20.169
I would've never run into that bastard.

09:20.171 --> 09:22.451
Okay, you know what? We're
changing this operation.

09:22.454 --> 09:24.540
This has become Operation Tough Love.

09:24.542 --> 09:27.677
Yeah, I'm gonna go all
Dr. Phil on your ass.

09:27.679 --> 09:29.112
It's time for you to man up,

09:29.114 --> 09:31.180
- and sort out...
- Daddy issues.

09:31.182 --> 09:33.182
I was going to say unresolved grief,

09:33.184 --> 09:34.984
but let's go with what you're saying.

09:34.986 --> 09:37.053
You want to know why
I've never seen a shrink?

09:37.055 --> 09:38.521
Why?

09:38.523 --> 09:41.791
I don't regret killing my old man.

09:41.793 --> 09:43.205
What?

09:43.208 --> 09:46.362
That's right, Pretty. You heard me.

09:46.364 --> 09:50.099
I let my old man burn to death.

09:50.101 --> 09:52.301
How's that for tough love?

10:01.212 --> 10:03.980
Pecan, mm.

10:06.918 --> 10:09.185
Oh, hell nah.

10:09.187 --> 10:11.821
What kind of monster
eats my mom's pecan pie

10:11.823 --> 10:14.557
and puts the container
back in the fridge?

10:14.559 --> 10:17.427
Gideon, who is the thief?

10:17.429 --> 10:18.828
There must be a theorem

10:18.830 --> 10:20.596
that supports the deceleration

10:20.598 --> 10:22.498
of the subject's rate of fission

10:22.500 --> 10:25.568
to individually power the thermacore.

10:25.570 --> 10:27.670
Any insights, Sir Isaac Newton?

10:27.672 --> 10:29.605
Or do I have to throw
an apple at your head?

10:29.607 --> 10:32.241
Perhaps if you afforded
us a brief reprieve.

10:32.243 --> 10:34.343
We've been working for hours.

10:34.345 --> 10:38.081
And when, dare I ask,
do I get to return home?

10:38.083 --> 10:40.650
You'll go home when I
say you can, Galileo.

10:40.652 --> 10:43.486
What about you, Madame Curie?

10:43.488 --> 10:45.388
You've been awfully quiet.

10:45.390 --> 10:48.057
How many time do I have to
explain it to you, Martin?

10:48.059 --> 10:51.794
There's only one way to
safely split the thermacore.

10:51.796 --> 10:53.463
Yes, but doing so would result

10:53.465 --> 10:55.398
in both Jefferson and
I losing our powers.

10:55.400 --> 10:56.999
I personally have no compunctions

10:57.001 --> 10:58.835
about that, but Jefferson...

10:58.837 --> 11:00.570
There you are.

11:02.507 --> 11:05.194
- My colleagues and I were...
- You didn't have to lie to me

11:05.197 --> 11:07.643
if you couldn't find a solution, man.

11:18.957 --> 11:20.923
Look, I'm sure it's not easy learning

11:20.925 --> 11:22.863
that your granddaughter's
in league with Damien Darhk.

11:22.865 --> 11:24.265
If you ever want to talk about it...

11:24.267 --> 11:25.658
What happened to men?

11:25.661 --> 11:28.264
When did you all start
talking about your feelings?

11:28.266 --> 11:29.799
Uh, early '90s?

11:29.801 --> 11:33.169
You are unusual journalists.

11:33.171 --> 11:34.705
Yeah, tell me about it.

11:34.708 --> 11:37.069
Most people run away when
they hear about a monster

11:37.072 --> 11:38.808
grabbing soldiers in the jungle.

11:38.810 --> 11:41.144
Us, we run towards it.

11:41.146 --> 11:42.979
Monster?

11:42.981 --> 11:44.981
What kind of monster stops the fighting

11:44.983 --> 11:47.083
between the Americans and the Vietcong?

11:47.085 --> 11:49.385
He's no monster.

11:49.387 --> 11:51.220
He's Ong Troi Moi.

11:51.222 --> 11:53.222
The New God.

11:57.695 --> 11:59.195
Hey, what's going on?

12:02.167 --> 12:04.567
Must be some sort of dead zone.

12:04.569 --> 12:06.502
We are here.

12:08.540 --> 12:11.674
Ray, can you hear me?

12:11.676 --> 12:14.544
Can't go a whole day without
talking to your boyfriend, huh?

12:14.546 --> 12:16.346
I think the comms are down.

12:16.349 --> 12:20.216
Don't drink the ground water.
It's probably contaminated.

12:20.218 --> 12:23.819
Those are some pretty rough
burns you got there, son.

12:23.821 --> 12:25.721
You get hit by Napalm?

12:25.723 --> 12:26.956
I ain't your son.

12:28.226 --> 12:30.593
Yeah.

12:32.197 --> 12:34.197
Do you know what's
on your father's head?

12:34.199 --> 12:37.333
- A little French-ie hat.
- That is a Green Beret.

12:37.335 --> 12:39.702
President Kennedy called them
"a symbol of excellence,

12:39.704 --> 12:41.037
a badge of courage."

12:41.039 --> 12:43.039
- Courage?
- Yeah.

12:43.041 --> 12:46.309
The only thing my old man was
good at was sitting in a chair.

12:46.311 --> 12:48.511
Cigarette in one hand,
beer in the other.

12:48.513 --> 12:51.103
And the only time he
ever got up was to...

12:54.619 --> 12:56.352
No, Mick, come on. Come on, come on.

12:56.354 --> 12:58.354
This is good, this is good. Look.

12:58.356 --> 13:01.057
Thanks to time travel, I got
to talk to my grandfather,

13:01.059 --> 13:03.759
and I got to work out a
lot of my father issues.

13:16.474 --> 13:19.375
Stand down. Stand down.

13:19.377 --> 13:20.943
Is that you, Petey Adams?

13:20.945 --> 13:22.745
What are you doing out here on your own?

13:22.747 --> 13:24.247
You get lost or something?

13:24.249 --> 13:26.983
Lost?

13:26.985 --> 13:29.352
No, I've become enlightened.

13:29.354 --> 13:32.021
You can be enlightened too

13:32.023 --> 13:33.289
if you join us.

13:33.291 --> 13:34.627
Who's us?

13:34.630 --> 13:37.627
This country does not belong to you.

13:37.629 --> 13:39.629
It belongs to Ong Troi Moi.

13:39.631 --> 13:42.231
I don't like where this is heading.

13:42.233 --> 13:44.700
Handle me that rifle, Petey.

13:44.702 --> 13:47.503
We'll work on getting you a hot meal.

13:47.505 --> 13:50.306
You will surrender to him.

13:50.308 --> 13:51.941
Or die.

14:12.297 --> 14:14.096
Get off me.

14:23.207 --> 14:25.056
Bunch of damn traitors.

14:27.879 --> 14:30.813
American and North Vietnamese
soldiers working arm-in-arm?

14:30.815 --> 14:33.215
This Anachronism is even
crazier than we thought.

14:35.053 --> 14:37.720
And I think I know how they're
blocking our communications.

14:37.722 --> 14:39.255
Hey, what is this place?

14:39.257 --> 14:41.223
I thought we were looking for a monster.

14:41.225 --> 14:43.292
You wish to speak to Ong Troi Moi?

14:43.294 --> 14:46.228
I've got a really bad
feeling about this.

14:46.230 --> 14:48.331
We'd be honored.

14:58.910 --> 15:00.843
We have guests.

15:00.845 --> 15:03.045
They're reporters, as you wanted.

15:14.659 --> 15:18.049
I am Grodd.

15:24.268 --> 15:27.596
Welcome to my kingdom.

15:32.351 --> 15:33.892
You saw what I saw, right?

15:33.895 --> 15:36.555
There's a gorilla sitting on a throne?

15:36.558 --> 15:38.392
He spoke better English than Mick.

15:38.394 --> 15:40.060
Well, he's clearly intelligent enough

15:40.062 --> 15:42.696
to trick these Gis to
abandon their posts.

15:42.698 --> 15:46.099
He's a monster. He needs to be stopped.

15:46.101 --> 15:49.269
Look, he's turned these
men into his slaves.

15:49.271 --> 15:51.772
Ong Troi Moi freed these soldiers.

15:51.774 --> 15:54.327
He is the reason they are no
longer killing one another.

15:54.330 --> 15:56.910
Yeah, it's a real utopia
he's created for himself.

15:56.912 --> 15:58.412
I brought you here to help

15:58.414 --> 16:01.148
spread Ong Troi Moi's
message to the world.

16:01.150 --> 16:04.184
You are only here to
document what you see.

16:04.186 --> 16:06.453
Of course.

16:13.228 --> 16:14.928
I need your shrink-ray.

16:14.930 --> 16:16.820
I dislike that the name is catching on.

16:16.823 --> 16:18.390
Look, even if you can miniaturize Grodd,

16:18.392 --> 16:19.960
there's still ten
miles of jungle warfare

16:19.962 --> 16:21.194
between us and the Waverider.

16:21.197 --> 16:22.596
Yeah, which is why you guys

16:22.599 --> 16:24.371
are going to take down
the communications jammer

16:24.373 --> 16:26.206
- and call for backup.
- While you take down

16:26.208 --> 16:29.409
a hyper-intelligent
telepathic primate by yourself?

16:29.411 --> 16:32.033
All I need is one clean shot.

16:44.426 --> 16:47.160
You saved my life today.

16:47.162 --> 16:49.429
Eh.

16:49.431 --> 16:52.049
Didn't want to have
to put you on my list.

16:53.936 --> 16:56.837
These are the names of all the men

16:56.839 --> 17:00.607
that died under my watch.

17:00.609 --> 17:03.610
Keep them with me to
remind myself it's my job

17:03.612 --> 17:07.481
to protect my men, get 'em back home.

17:07.483 --> 17:09.616
That's my girl.

17:09.617 --> 17:11.785
Gonna marry her when I get back.

17:14.556 --> 17:17.017
Quit looking at her.

17:22.231 --> 17:26.031
Maybe even start a family someday.

17:26.034 --> 17:29.336
You want kids?

17:29.338 --> 17:31.471
Why not?

17:31.473 --> 17:35.075
As long as they never end up
in some godforsaken jungle.

17:37.045 --> 17:39.880
I've seen things out here...

17:39.882 --> 17:42.749
no, I hope I never bring home with me.

17:46.622 --> 17:51.458
I've never told anybody
this before but...

17:51.460 --> 17:54.795
I'm scared.

17:54.797 --> 17:59.900
I don't know who I am if
I'm not a part of Firestorm.

17:59.902 --> 18:03.257
But you've never had any superpowers

18:03.260 --> 18:04.604
and that's never stopped you

18:04.606 --> 18:07.574
from being the most kick-ass
person I've ever met.

18:12.181 --> 18:15.486
Well, good talk, Captain.

18:28.564 --> 18:31.364
Wow, I knew Grodd was a
power-hungry tyrant but...

18:31.366 --> 18:33.333
He's one hell of an electrical engineer.

18:33.335 --> 18:34.768
The key is to jam the jammer

18:34.770 --> 18:36.636
without anyone realizing it's jammed.

18:36.638 --> 18:37.938
Did that make sense?

18:37.940 --> 18:39.306
Perfect.

18:39.308 --> 18:41.241
Where are we taking Grodd

18:41.243 --> 18:43.009
when we return him to where he belongs?

18:43.011 --> 18:46.246
Well, last I heard he
was in an ARGUS prison.

18:46.248 --> 18:49.382
Wait, he's just another persecuted meta?

18:49.384 --> 18:51.718
Look, I know you're not a fan of ARGUS,

18:51.720 --> 18:53.954
but Grodd is a psychopath,

18:53.956 --> 18:57.224
and, well, a giant gorilla.

19:01.330 --> 19:02.963
Ray? Jax? Can you hear me?

19:02.965 --> 19:04.998
I think there is something up with Mick.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.168
He's got that look, you know,
when he's eyes get all crazed.

19:08.170 --> 19:11.204
I think the jungle's
finally getting to...

19:11.206 --> 19:13.974
Hey, man, you good?

19:13.976 --> 19:16.276
Mick?

19:16.278 --> 19:17.844
What were you doing?

19:17.846 --> 19:19.646
What does it look like?

19:19.648 --> 19:22.482
Uh...

19:22.484 --> 19:26.319
Looks like you were...

19:26.321 --> 19:28.421
burning your own skin,

19:28.423 --> 19:32.759
but that would be
completely insane, right?

19:32.761 --> 19:34.561
Huh.

19:34.563 --> 19:37.597
My whole life I saw him as a monster.

19:37.599 --> 19:42.936
Blamed him for all the
sick things that I've done.

19:42.938 --> 19:45.705
But now I see...

19:45.707 --> 19:49.242
I'm worse than him.

19:49.244 --> 19:53.046
Should have been me that
burned in that house.

20:02.291 --> 20:03.790
- You're a genius.
- Thanks.

20:03.792 --> 20:05.425
Sorry, I was talking to myself.

20:05.427 --> 20:07.794
- Huh?
- Hello?

20:07.796 --> 20:09.963
- Can anybody hear me?
- Nate, is that you?

20:09.965 --> 20:13.233
Yes, our comms are down.

20:13.235 --> 20:15.460
No, no, no, no, they were
jammed, and I just fixed...

20:15.463 --> 20:18.338
- I mean, Zari un-jammed it.
- Where are you guys?

20:18.340 --> 20:20.140
We need to get out of this jungle ASAP.

20:20.142 --> 20:21.675
Oh, no, what's wrong, buddy?

20:21.677 --> 20:23.677
Well, when Mick and I started,

20:23.679 --> 20:25.045
we were doing "Predator."

20:25.047 --> 20:26.611
Then we ran into Mick's dad,

20:26.614 --> 20:28.280
and now we're doing
"Apocalypse Now."

20:28.283 --> 20:29.385
That's why Mick didn't want

20:29.388 --> 20:31.084
to come to Vietnam, on
the off chance he'd run

20:31.086 --> 20:32.616
- into his father.
- Which is about as

20:32.619 --> 20:34.171
unlikely as Marty meeting

20:34.174 --> 20:36.327
his great-great-grandfather Sir Stein.

20:36.330 --> 20:37.691
Right, or young-you

20:37.693 --> 20:40.060
befriending a time-displaced alien.

20:40.062 --> 20:42.116
Do you people not hear me?

20:42.119 --> 20:44.864
Listen, the monster-slash-Anachronism

20:44.866 --> 20:46.766
is Gorilla Grodd.

20:46.768 --> 20:48.568
We're stuck in his compound.

20:48.570 --> 20:50.314
Did you just say "Gorilla Grodd?"

20:50.317 --> 20:54.468
Grodd's displacement in
1967 probably explains that.

20:54.471 --> 20:56.242
Uh, guys?

20:56.244 --> 20:59.446
Our Anachronism just jumped
from an eight to a level ten.

20:59.448 --> 21:01.203
Gideon, what you got?

21:01.206 --> 21:02.772
The timeline is currently in flux.

21:02.775 --> 21:04.150
However, the following headline

21:04.152 --> 21:05.952
recently appeared in my archives.

21:07.689 --> 21:10.991
It appears that Grodd
is using the powder keg

21:10.993 --> 21:14.294
that is the Vietnam War to
somehow ignite World War III.

21:14.296 --> 21:16.196
- What?
- Where's Amaya?

21:16.198 --> 21:18.231
We have to figure out Grodd's
plan and get out of here.

21:18.233 --> 21:19.632
Yeah.

21:52.334 --> 21:54.834
This is how you repay Grodd

21:54.836 --> 21:56.569
for his hospitality?

21:56.571 --> 21:59.672
By trying to kill me?

21:59.674 --> 22:03.643
Let me help you with
that weapon of yours.

22:06.615 --> 22:09.716
You think I am the enemy.

22:09.718 --> 22:12.819
Look at what you humans have done

22:12.821 --> 22:14.921
to one another.

22:14.923 --> 22:18.525
Look at what humans did to me.

22:22.630 --> 22:26.932
So you're raising an army of
humans to get your revenge?

22:26.935 --> 22:28.868
Revenge?

22:28.870 --> 22:30.503
No.

22:30.505 --> 22:33.807
My only wish is to help your kind

22:33.809 --> 22:36.076
find peace.

22:36.078 --> 22:38.378
And how do you plan to do that?

22:49.558 --> 22:51.624
Welcome to Vietnam, Mr. President.

22:51.626 --> 22:54.260
Good lord, it's hotter than
a preacher's knee out here.

22:54.262 --> 22:56.463
You hit the nail on
the head, Mr. President.

22:56.465 --> 22:59.532
Follow me, we'll get you
into some air conditioning.

23:31.906 --> 23:33.972
You're planning to kill the President?

23:33.974 --> 23:35.340
We're defending our home

23:35.342 --> 23:37.242
against those who have attacked us.

23:37.244 --> 23:39.211
Which I'm all for, believe me,

23:39.213 --> 23:41.146
but you need to draw a line somewhere.

23:41.148 --> 23:42.948
Grodd is only doing what is necessary.

23:42.950 --> 23:44.950
Necessary for who?

23:44.952 --> 23:48.086
He only cares about himself.
That's how dictators work.

23:48.088 --> 23:49.937
I have lost

23:49.940 --> 23:52.841
both my parents.

23:52.844 --> 23:56.012
My brother, my village.

23:56.015 --> 23:58.764
Ong Troi Moi is the only one left

23:58.766 --> 24:00.933
to protect us.

24:00.935 --> 24:04.937
Hey, I know what it's like
to lose the people you love

24:04.939 --> 24:07.472
in a senseless war.

24:07.474 --> 24:09.675
It makes you desperate, but...

24:09.677 --> 24:12.644
if you really want
peace, it starts with you.

24:18.485 --> 24:20.085
Did you guys hear that?

24:20.087 --> 24:21.687
They're targeting the
President's convoy.

24:31.231 --> 24:32.931
Anh is weak.

24:32.933 --> 24:34.800
Grodd.

24:42.576 --> 24:43.796
Where are you going?

24:43.799 --> 24:45.776
You heard Zari. To save L.B.J.

24:45.779 --> 24:47.516
It's sounds like the
team's got their hands full.

24:47.518 --> 24:49.580
It's too dangerous. We'll
go together as Firestorm.

24:49.583 --> 24:51.550
No, we won't. I got
to do this on my own.

24:51.552 --> 24:52.618
Please, don't.

24:52.620 --> 24:53.685
I'm still working on a way

24:53.687 --> 24:54.968
to split the thermacore.

24:54.971 --> 24:56.989
Okay, I don't know if this is your way

24:56.991 --> 24:59.057
of making yourself feel
better about us splitting up

24:59.059 --> 25:02.461
by making sure I've got powers,
but I can do this without any.

25:02.463 --> 25:06.932
And soon enough, I'm gonna have
to stand on my own without you.

25:11.472 --> 25:13.506
We just intercepted radio communications

25:13.508 --> 25:15.040
and triangulated the enemy's position

25:15.042 --> 25:16.510
to a base just east of here.

25:16.513 --> 25:17.669
That's where they're holed up.

25:17.671 --> 25:18.711
Don't know about you boys,

25:18.713 --> 25:20.079
but I'm ready to go to work.

25:21.215 --> 25:22.615
We can't let them get near

25:22.617 --> 25:24.316
that camp, okay?

25:24.319 --> 25:26.411
These yahoos are gonna
shoot anything that moves.

25:26.414 --> 25:27.853
Our friends are in there.

25:27.855 --> 25:30.222
Amaya's in there.

25:30.224 --> 25:31.657
Do you hear me?

25:31.659 --> 25:34.002
You fellas ready?

25:34.005 --> 25:35.304
Actually, Sarge,

25:35.307 --> 25:36.474
you're gonna have to tell your men

25:36.476 --> 25:37.539
to stand down.

25:37.542 --> 25:39.465
I just received intel
that the encampment

25:39.467 --> 25:40.833
is a no-fire zone.

25:40.835 --> 25:42.701
Nobody told me about any intel.

25:42.703 --> 25:44.709
Well, the intel was on
a need-to-know basis,

25:44.712 --> 25:46.278
and you didn't need to know till now.

25:46.281 --> 25:48.474
Can you explain the situation to my men?

25:48.476 --> 25:51.243
Yeah, no problem.

25:51.245 --> 25:52.545
Listen up.

25:54.615 --> 25:59.084
I don't take orders from the CIA.

25:59.086 --> 26:01.053
You in or you out, son?

26:01.055 --> 26:04.190
I'm in, pops.

26:04.192 --> 26:06.025
Figure of speech.

26:06.027 --> 26:08.427
Hmm.

26:16.637 --> 26:18.204
What's going on?

26:18.206 --> 26:20.539
Well, Grodd wants to
start World War III.

26:20.541 --> 26:23.108
The sooner your great
nations destroy one another,

26:23.110 --> 26:24.677
the sooner there will be peace.

26:24.679 --> 26:27.213
One nation under Grodd.

26:27.215 --> 26:29.815
Grodd!

26:34.088 --> 26:37.059
The U.S. President will
pay for his atrocities.

26:37.062 --> 26:39.676
Hey, you don't have to do
this to get what you want.

26:41.295 --> 26:42.761
She's right.

26:42.763 --> 26:45.664
We're here to bring you home.

26:50.004 --> 26:52.238
You have every right to be angry.

26:52.240 --> 26:55.941
This world is cruel.

26:55.943 --> 26:59.578
What was done to you by humans...

26:59.580 --> 27:01.480
it's unforgivable.

27:01.482 --> 27:04.817
But you must understand that
we are not here to hurt you.

27:04.819 --> 27:09.788
And how will you bring me back home?

27:09.790 --> 27:12.157
Unless...

27:12.159 --> 27:15.961
ah, you're time-travelers.

27:15.963 --> 27:18.697
I will not go with you.

27:18.699 --> 27:21.600
There is nothing for me where I am from.

27:21.602 --> 27:24.103
- Only pain.
- You're right.

27:24.105 --> 27:26.939
- Maybe we don't take you home.
- We don't?

27:26.941 --> 27:29.975
We can take you to a time before humans.

27:29.977 --> 27:34.847
A time where you can live
out your days in peace.

27:34.849 --> 27:37.981
And why would Grodd trust you?

27:46.360 --> 27:49.995
Because I'm different.

28:16.492 --> 28:18.025
There's been a breach!

28:18.028 --> 28:20.225
All squads defend the perimeter!

28:21.429 --> 28:24.263
You betrayed me.

28:24.265 --> 28:27.119
No, I promise we had
nothing to do with this.

28:45.253 --> 28:47.320
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.

28:47.322 --> 28:48.788
You have to believe me.

28:48.790 --> 28:51.357
Humans will always fear Grodd,

28:51.359 --> 28:52.962
hunt Grodd,

28:52.965 --> 28:56.529
but with your time
machine at Grodd's command,

28:56.531 --> 28:59.499
there will be no humans.

28:59.501 --> 29:02.435
Grodd will alter the
course of evolution.

29:02.437 --> 29:05.004
He will no longer need a gorilla country

29:05.006 --> 29:08.975
because Grodd will
have a gorilla planet.

29:12.180 --> 29:14.413
You better tell the Professor

29:14.415 --> 29:16.407
he's gonna have company.

29:18.253 --> 29:19.852
Who's in charge around here?

29:21.723 --> 29:23.823
What in the world?

29:31.132 --> 29:33.366
Get off me.

29:36.704 --> 29:38.363
Call in an air strike.

29:38.366 --> 29:41.007
We'll let a Napalm take care
of whatever the hell that was.

29:41.009 --> 29:43.242
We got deserters to deal with.

29:47.182 --> 29:49.102
Raymond, I must have misheard you.

29:49.105 --> 29:50.716
Did you say Grodd was on his way here?

29:50.718 --> 29:53.286
Sure did, man... he's planning
on stealing the Waverider.

29:53.288 --> 29:55.388
I swear to you, if I die today

29:55.390 --> 29:57.089
because of a telepathic gorilla,

29:57.091 --> 29:58.791
I'm going to be very upset.

29:58.793 --> 30:00.459
Yeah, well, then get
the Waverider moving.

30:00.461 --> 30:03.429
Hands on your head, traitor.

30:06.034 --> 30:08.701
Let's go, move it.

30:08.703 --> 30:11.270
- Amaya.
- Nathaniel.

30:11.272 --> 30:14.040
- Shut up.
- Are you okay?

30:14.042 --> 30:17.076
Mick? Mick.

30:17.078 --> 30:18.578
What's wrong with him?

30:18.580 --> 30:20.680
I'm afraid he's gone full Kurtz.

30:20.682 --> 30:22.248
What does that mean?

30:22.250 --> 30:23.849
It's a movie reference.

30:23.851 --> 30:26.619
Great movie, terrible situation.

30:26.621 --> 30:28.988
They say life is the sum total

30:28.990 --> 30:31.791
of all the choices you make.

30:31.793 --> 30:33.993
As your misfortune sinks in,

30:33.995 --> 30:35.795
maybe you want to ask yourself,

30:35.797 --> 30:38.564
what choices did I make
to find myself here?

30:38.566 --> 30:40.766
Today I want payback

30:40.768 --> 30:43.202
for what that monster did
to my men, my brothers.

30:43.204 --> 30:45.204
- Uh, excuse... excuse me.
- Shut up.

30:45.206 --> 30:47.306
- We're journalist.
- Shut up.

30:47.308 --> 30:49.475
And we've uncovered a plot
to kill President Johnson.

30:49.477 --> 30:50.843
We need to alert the proper authorities.

30:50.845 --> 30:52.445
- Shut up.
- See?

30:52.447 --> 30:53.879
Hey, he's telling the truth.

30:53.881 --> 30:55.881
The President landed in Vietnam.

30:55.883 --> 30:57.483
But we can still save him.

30:57.485 --> 30:59.085
You're reporters. What are you gonna do?

30:59.087 --> 31:00.720
Question him to safety?

31:00.722 --> 31:02.421
It's a little more
complicated than that,

31:02.423 --> 31:03.623
but just trust me, okay?

31:03.625 --> 31:04.785
We're the good guys.

31:04.788 --> 31:07.059
Haven't you hear?

31:07.061 --> 31:08.808
There are no good guys here.

31:13.735 --> 31:15.301
Stop!

31:15.303 --> 31:17.027
Stop, stop, stop!

31:17.030 --> 31:18.938
Hey, wait. Wait.

31:18.940 --> 31:21.407
Wait, wait. Whoa, don't shoot.

31:21.409 --> 31:23.509
Don't shoot. I'm an American.

31:23.511 --> 31:25.444
You've got to back the hell up.

31:25.446 --> 31:27.647
Son, we're gonna be on you
like a duck on a june bug

31:27.649 --> 31:29.115
if we don't start moving again.

31:29.117 --> 31:32.051
Mr. President, your life is in danger.

31:32.053 --> 31:34.487
Okay? That road block is a trap.

31:34.489 --> 31:37.256
You've got to get back to base.

31:37.258 --> 31:39.425
- Step back, sir.
- Wai... no, no, no.

31:40.728 --> 31:42.662
Whoa, whoa.

31:44.265 --> 31:45.731
Mr. President, stop!

31:45.733 --> 31:47.867
Whoa, Mr. President.

31:47.869 --> 31:49.302
Don't move!

31:49.304 --> 31:51.504
Don't. Move.

31:51.506 --> 31:53.566
Enough talk.

32:00.715 --> 32:03.382
Time to pay the entrance
fee to this circus.

32:06.120 --> 32:07.787
Don't.

32:07.789 --> 32:09.977
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.

32:09.980 --> 32:11.524
What are you talking about?

32:11.526 --> 32:14.293
I know what's going on
in that head of yours.

32:14.295 --> 32:16.729
But killing these people is
not gonna bring back your men.

32:16.731 --> 32:18.731
What do you know about anything?

32:18.733 --> 32:22.034
Mick, you do realize what
will happen if you kill him?

32:22.036 --> 32:23.569
Don't care.

32:23.571 --> 32:25.571
This is insubordination, son.

32:25.573 --> 32:27.573
I wouldn't have expected that from you.

32:27.575 --> 32:28.674
Well, you don't know me.

32:28.676 --> 32:31.210
Lower your weapon.

32:31.212 --> 32:34.547
Lower yours.

32:34.549 --> 32:37.616
I got nothing to lose.

32:37.618 --> 32:39.819
But you do.

32:39.821 --> 32:42.154
You get to go home.

32:42.156 --> 32:44.824
But if you kill these people,

32:44.826 --> 32:47.193
you'll hear their screams forever.

32:47.195 --> 32:50.096
And one day...

32:50.098 --> 32:52.031
when you have a family,

32:52.033 --> 32:54.900
you won't be able to
look them in the eye.

32:54.902 --> 32:59.338
Because this day, this
act you're about to commit,

32:59.340 --> 33:01.807
will be burned in your memory forever.

33:13.521 --> 33:14.854
Why'd you do that?

33:14.856 --> 33:16.322
I always wanted to.

33:16.324 --> 33:18.491
Route is clear. Weapons hot.

33:20.828 --> 33:22.395
Okay.

33:22.397 --> 33:24.530
You guys walked through a mine field,

33:24.532 --> 33:26.999
and I'm pretty sure you're
caught in a Soviet trip line.

33:27.001 --> 33:28.337
But by freezing it,

33:28.340 --> 33:29.969
you should be able to step away.

33:29.971 --> 33:31.570
Should?

33:31.572 --> 33:33.406
Okay, on the count of three,

33:33.408 --> 33:36.609
I want you to step away slowly.

33:36.611 --> 33:39.311
One... two...

33:39.313 --> 33:41.180
three.

33:50.091 --> 33:52.491
Oh.

33:52.493 --> 33:55.494
I'll be a damn humdinger.

33:55.496 --> 33:58.497
Sounds like our Viet Cong
friends are circling in.

33:58.499 --> 34:02.067
Okay, well, we better hustle
through this minefield.

34:02.069 --> 34:04.236
Uh...

34:04.238 --> 34:06.572
Follow my lead, and, uh,

34:06.574 --> 34:09.108
if I don't blow up, path's clear.

34:09.110 --> 34:10.876
And if you blow up?

34:10.878 --> 34:12.945
Then you're on your own, sir.

34:16.407 --> 34:19.485
- Well, that wasn't so hard.
- That's because I'm helping.

34:24.891 --> 34:26.559
That your idea of helping?

34:26.561 --> 34:28.561
I'm afraid we have an
unexpected passenger.

34:33.266 --> 34:34.900
You're afraid?

34:34.902 --> 34:36.835
Follow my steps exactly.

34:36.838 --> 34:39.170
I wasn't planning on improvising.

34:53.454 --> 34:55.321
Okay, come on, Mr. President.

34:55.322 --> 34:57.890
One more step. You got this.

34:57.892 --> 34:59.829
Come on.

35:17.278 --> 35:20.246
Where is Captain Lance when I need her?

35:23.284 --> 35:25.084
Sara...

35:25.086 --> 35:27.820
were you just waiting
for the right moment

35:27.822 --> 35:30.823
to make a dramatic entrance?

35:30.825 --> 35:32.625
Are you all right?

35:32.627 --> 35:35.794
There is no Sara.

35:35.796 --> 35:37.730
What?

35:37.732 --> 35:39.899
Only Grodd.

35:41.836 --> 35:43.602
It appears that the Captain

35:43.604 --> 35:45.373
is under some sort of telepathic control.

35:45.376 --> 35:47.039
Really, Gideon? You think so?

35:47.041 --> 35:50.743
I claim this ship for the New God.

35:50.745 --> 35:52.842
Kneel before Gro...

35:55.816 --> 35:59.785
Oh, how I do love
proving my laws of motion.

35:59.787 --> 36:01.779
Please, save that
lecture for another day.

36:01.782 --> 36:02.931
Professor Stein,

36:02.934 --> 36:05.223
a U.S. military air
strike is approaching.

36:05.226 --> 36:08.160
And Grodd is still
clinging to the Waverider.

36:08.162 --> 36:10.029
I have an idea.

36:26.419 --> 36:29.020
Hey, are you sure you won't reconsider?

36:29.022 --> 36:30.788
I can get you out of here.

36:30.790 --> 36:34.192
You can start over somewhere
where there's no war.

36:34.194 --> 36:36.627
No, my struggle is here.

36:36.629 --> 36:39.192
I realize now my people,

36:39.195 --> 36:43.568
they do not need a god.

36:43.570 --> 36:45.364
They need a leader.

36:48.108 --> 36:50.408
Like you said,

36:50.410 --> 36:53.411
peace starts with me.

37:00.086 --> 37:03.056
Got some R and R scheduled in
a few days down in Eagle Beach.

37:03.059 --> 37:06.724
You CIA boys ever get time off,
maybe I'll see you down there.

37:06.726 --> 37:09.160
Anything's possible.

37:09.162 --> 37:11.129
You saved innocent lives.

37:11.131 --> 37:12.630
You saved me.

37:12.632 --> 37:15.366
Pulled me back from crossing that line.

37:15.368 --> 37:16.968
Well, I've been pulled back

37:16.970 --> 37:20.605
from that line a couple of times myself.

37:20.607 --> 37:22.731
Listen, uh...

37:22.734 --> 37:25.602
if that kid of yours

37:25.605 --> 37:28.479
happens to be a boy...

37:28.481 --> 37:31.983
Yeah?

37:31.985 --> 37:34.952
Never mind.

37:40.660 --> 37:43.708
Looks like Operation
Tough Love was a success.

37:50.870 --> 37:54.439
Yeah, figured you'd want this back.

37:54.441 --> 37:57.442
I don't need it anymore.

38:12.826 --> 38:16.327
- Raymond, are you in there?
- Yeah, I'm in here.

38:16.329 --> 38:19.497
Just trying to rebuild the
Molecular Hyper Compressor.

38:19.499 --> 38:22.567
You mean the shrink-ray that
I didn't get to use Grodd?

38:22.569 --> 38:24.735
Yes, it took quite a beating.

38:24.737 --> 38:26.838
Uh, what are... What are you doing here?

38:26.840 --> 38:29.574
I came by to say that you were right.

38:29.576 --> 38:31.976
Well, you and Nathaniel,

38:31.978 --> 38:34.378
but I'd rather you didn't say anything.

38:34.380 --> 38:38.749
No, of course not.
Uh, I won't say a word.

38:38.751 --> 38:40.618
About what exactly?

38:40.620 --> 38:42.453
Kuasa.

38:42.455 --> 38:44.088
This experience with Grodd...

38:44.090 --> 38:46.591
he wasn't born a monster.

38:46.593 --> 38:49.927
He was made into one.

38:49.929 --> 38:54.398
And for all I know, the same
is true of my granddaughter.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.033
So, thank you.

38:56.035 --> 38:58.369
Yeah, you're welcome.

39:00.672 --> 39:02.273
Well, I'm relieved you're all right.

39:02.275 --> 39:03.661
Got a little close back there.

39:03.664 --> 39:06.009
By the way, you were right.

39:06.012 --> 39:09.780
I was putting myself under
a lot of pressure to resolve

39:09.782 --> 39:11.849
our separation problem.

39:11.851 --> 39:14.418
I just wanted to make sure
I had done everything I could

39:14.420 --> 39:17.088
to keep you safe before I left.

39:17.090 --> 39:19.056
But you're gonna be just fine.

39:19.058 --> 39:21.159
You already carry the
most important part

39:21.161 --> 39:22.927
of Firestorm within you.

39:22.929 --> 39:25.296
His spirit.

39:25.298 --> 39:28.166
You getting all soft on me, Grey?

39:28.168 --> 39:32.336
But for real, I'm gonna miss
you when you're gone, man.

39:32.338 --> 39:34.972
Anyway, you said you
had something to show me.

39:34.974 --> 39:38.209
Oh, uh, yeah, so...

39:38.211 --> 39:40.411
after I saved L.B.J.'s life,

39:40.413 --> 39:43.447
I thought I'd get, like,
a medal or something,

39:43.449 --> 39:47.618
but he just tells me he's got
some top secret information.

39:47.620 --> 39:49.587
And hands me this.

39:54.661 --> 39:57.328
Oh, dear God.

39:57.330 --> 40:00.331
This is incredible.

40:00.333 --> 40:02.600
So, instead of a medal for bravery,

40:02.602 --> 40:05.223
President Johnson gave you a pie recipe.

40:05.226 --> 40:07.104
Well, not just any recipe.

40:07.106 --> 40:10.308
Ladybird Johnson's
pecan pie was legendary.

40:10.310 --> 40:12.777
The ingredients were
very closely kept secret

40:12.779 --> 40:14.212
for a long time.

40:14.214 --> 40:15.947
Eh, it's almost as good as my mom's pie.

40:15.949 --> 40:20.117
I don't know. First
Lady pie is pretty good.

40:20.119 --> 40:21.919
This is a great gift.

40:21.921 --> 40:24.889
Way better than a medal
'cause you can eat it.

40:24.891 --> 40:26.857
Whoa.

40:26.859 --> 40:28.459
What?

40:28.461 --> 40:31.062
You guys weren't going
to save me any pie?

40:31.064 --> 40:33.297
Aye-oh-what!

40:33.299 --> 40:36.634
Welcome back to the land
of the living, Captain.

40:36.636 --> 40:39.205
Gideon gave me a clean bill of health.

40:39.208 --> 40:40.838
- Hello, love.
- Hi.

40:40.840 --> 40:43.140
But I don't know about
this bump on my head.

40:45.445 --> 40:46.744
Who's the new guy?

40:46.746 --> 40:48.412
Oh, don't ask.

40:48.414 --> 40:50.514
Well, this was quite an adventure.

40:50.516 --> 40:52.116
Where to next?

40:52.118 --> 40:53.751
Shut up, you bop.

41:00.927 --> 41:03.461
Ah, Vietnam.

41:03.463 --> 41:05.783
Crappy war. Bitchin' music.

41:05.786 --> 41:07.356
Where is Grodd?

41:07.359 --> 41:09.126
Who are you?

41:09.129 --> 41:12.937
Is that any way to treat
your number one fan?

41:12.940 --> 41:15.095
A nuclear crisis in Central City?

41:15.098 --> 41:16.607
Masterful.

41:16.609 --> 41:18.843
Why else do you think I'd
pull you out of Vietnam

41:18.845 --> 41:20.945
before you fell into
that Napalm inferno?

41:20.947 --> 41:23.943
Send me back.

41:23.946 --> 41:26.584
I know you wanted a time ship,

41:26.586 --> 41:28.419
but who needs a lumbering tin can

41:28.421 --> 41:31.422
when you can time travel
with a single thought?
