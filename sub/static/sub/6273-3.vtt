00:00.066 --> 00:01.433
Virginia:  <i>Previously on</i>
<i>masters of sex...</i>

00:01.435 --> 00:04.870
William:  <i>I'm starting</i>
<i>a new job at</i>
<i>memorial hospital.</i>

00:04.872 --> 00:06.538
With the money
comes bill masters,

00:06.540 --> 00:08.807
And with bill masters
comes his study.

00:08.809 --> 00:11.143
Will virginia
be joining you?

00:11.145 --> 00:11.844
It may not be possible

00:11.846 --> 00:15.414
For you to come over
to memorial for a while.

00:15.416 --> 00:16.515
My name is
on that study.

00:16.517 --> 00:19.485
I know the structure,
the methodology of the study.

00:19.487 --> 00:21.520
I helped to
develop it with you.

00:21.522 --> 00:22.521
Virginia:  <i>We could</i>
<i>have an affair.</i>

00:22.523 --> 00:27.026
<i>But what we have between us</i>
<i>is so much more than that.</i>

00:27.028 --> 00:28.360
We have the work.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.496
Of course we're not
having an affair, virginia.

00:30.498 --> 00:32.031
We never were.
I'm a happily married man.

00:32.033 --> 00:36.969
And I think
it would be a mistake
to, uh, to end it now.

00:36.971 --> 00:39.204
Mrs. Holden,
nice to see you again.

00:39.206 --> 00:40.706
Enjoy your evening.

00:40.708 --> 00:41.874
(door closes)

00:41.876 --> 00:43.942
Dr. Holden.

00:46.346 --> 00:48.981
(theme music playing)

01:34.627 --> 01:36.295
Henry!

01:36.930 --> 01:37.663
Henry?

01:37.665 --> 01:40.466
Henry: I'll be right there!

01:42.268 --> 01:44.837
What is keeping
your brother?

01:44.839 --> 01:46.138
His hair.

01:46.140 --> 01:46.572
His...

01:46.574 --> 01:49.041
Diane delmonico
told him he looks
like howdy doody,

01:49.043 --> 01:51.376
So he's trying
a center part.

01:51.511 --> 01:53.812
What's daddy's address?

01:54.114 --> 01:56.248
You're writing him a letter?

01:56.250 --> 01:58.484
You're staying
at his place tonight.

01:58.486 --> 01:59.651
It's not for him.

01:59.653 --> 02:02.321
It's for the
tooth fairy princess.

02:02.323 --> 02:03.655
Look.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.190
If it falls out
when I'm at daddy's,

02:05.192 --> 02:08.627
She might not know
where to come pick it up.

02:08.629 --> 02:11.964
So you're leaving
a forwarding address.

02:11.966 --> 02:13.132
Smart, huh?

02:13.134 --> 02:13.499
Very.

02:13.501 --> 02:17.369
Only, the tooth fairy
isn't a princess, honey.

02:17.371 --> 02:19.371
She's only a fairy.

02:19.373 --> 02:20.105
Oh, no. She is.

02:20.107 --> 02:23.775
She's a fairy princess
that specializes in teeth.

02:23.777 --> 02:24.643
(chuckles)

02:24.645 --> 02:27.579
And is there
a tooth fairy prince?

02:27.581 --> 02:28.647
Mom,
men can't be fairies.

02:28.649 --> 02:32.618
There's only
one kind of prince,
the handsome prince.

02:32.620 --> 02:33.352
Hmm.

02:33.354 --> 02:35.420
And what if,
just supposing,

02:35.422 --> 02:39.091
A prince was rushing
to rescue his princess...

02:39.093 --> 02:39.858
Okay.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.860
And he fell off his horse.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.061
His steed.

02:43.063 --> 02:44.029
His steed,

02:44.031 --> 02:45.164
And he got trampled,

02:45.166 --> 02:48.700
And his face ended up
horribly disfigured.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.369
I guess that
could happen.

02:50.371 --> 02:53.005
But the princess would have
had to see him before,

02:53.007 --> 02:54.373
Back when he was handsome.

02:54.375 --> 02:55.407
And she would know
he was the one

02:55.409 --> 02:59.144
She was gonna
end up living happily
ever after with.

02:59.146 --> 03:01.513
And that's just
inevitable, huh?

03:01.515 --> 03:03.515
The "happily
ever after" part.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.450
I don't know
what "invetible" means.

03:05.452 --> 03:08.287
Ah! At last!
Something you don't know.

03:08.289 --> 03:09.188
Um...

03:09.190 --> 03:15.027
Fated,
inescapable, or something
that has to happen.

03:15.029 --> 03:17.296
Anyway, the princess
would end up kissing him,

03:17.298 --> 03:19.097
And his face would
go back to normal.

03:19.099 --> 03:21.266
Daddy's address?

03:21.901 --> 03:27.372
8573 mclaren avenue.

03:29.242 --> 03:30.676
Henry, please!

03:30.678 --> 03:33.378
Henry:
All right, all right!

03:33.446 --> 03:33.979
So, you know why

03:33.981 --> 03:37.249
I think you
like fairy tales
so much, bunny rabbit?

03:37.251 --> 03:37.583
Hmm?

03:37.585 --> 03:39.885
I think that
you like knowing

03:39.887 --> 03:42.921
How things
are going to end.

03:44.157 --> 03:44.923
(monitor beeping)

03:44.925 --> 03:48.227
Dr. Masters: Fundal pressure
on the next contraction,
nurse, please.

03:48.229 --> 03:50.162
Yes, doctor.

03:50.496 --> 03:53.632
Very good. Here we go.
Bulb syringe.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.937
(baby cooing)

04:13.820 --> 04:14.886
And the mother?

04:14.888 --> 04:16.788
Vitals steady.

04:16.956 --> 04:20.058
What do you
have there, maureen?

04:20.260 --> 04:22.127
It's a...

04:22.129 --> 04:23.328
Um...

04:23.330 --> 04:24.963
Dr. Masters?

04:26.366 --> 04:28.834
What is it, doctor?

04:32.705 --> 04:34.840
Can you say it
again, please?

04:34.842 --> 04:37.409
Slower this time.

04:37.411 --> 04:39.945
Adrenogenital hyperplasia.

04:39.947 --> 04:43.382
Wait.
I should, uh...

04:44.284 --> 04:45.517
Take the baby, nate?

04:45.519 --> 04:47.452
I want to write that down.

04:47.454 --> 04:48.687
Why?

04:48.689 --> 04:51.657
For me and for
when people ask.

04:51.659 --> 04:54.126
Nobody's going
to ask, francine.

04:54.128 --> 04:56.495
Nobody's going to know.
And I'm not holding it,

04:56.497 --> 04:57.596
So don't ask me again.

04:57.598 --> 04:59.831
It's not an "it,"
mr. Bombeck. It's a boy.

04:59.833 --> 05:03.268
The blood test conclusively
shows the xy chromosome.

05:03.270 --> 05:06.238
A boy, nate.
Like we wanted.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.473
You think I wanted that,
something you'd pay a nickel

05:08.475 --> 05:11.009
To see
on the boardwalk
in atlantic city?

05:11.011 --> 05:12.744
I understand
the physical ambiguity

05:12.746 --> 05:14.346
Is, uh, off-putting,
mr. Bombeck,

05:14.348 --> 05:17.449
But eventually,
the surgery will
take care of that.

05:17.451 --> 05:18.917
Eventually? Eventually?

05:18.919 --> 05:20.719
You're... You're telling me
you're expecting us

05:20.721 --> 05:23.689
To leave this place with
a kid that looks like that?

05:23.691 --> 05:25.557
The baby's
otherwise in good health.

05:25.559 --> 05:26.591
He'll be released.

05:26.593 --> 05:27.592
And in the meantime,

05:27.594 --> 05:29.661
A surgical plan
will be formulated.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.630
We can't take
him home like this.

05:31.632 --> 05:32.464
People will see.

05:32.466 --> 05:35.000
We've both got mothers
itching to change diapers.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.369
If you explain,
you don't think
they'll understand?

05:37.371 --> 05:38.403
Nate: Hell,
I don't understand.

05:38.405 --> 05:39.705
So the sooner
he looks like

05:39.707 --> 05:41.139
It's supposed to
look like down there,

05:41.141 --> 05:43.041
The better it is
for everyone.

05:43.043 --> 05:43.675
Not for the child.

05:43.677 --> 05:47.045
There's no advantage
to operating on a newborn.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.780
What do you do?

05:48.782 --> 05:49.781
Just...

05:49.783 --> 05:50.582
(baby coos)

05:50.584 --> 05:53.318
...Sew up the...
You know, opening?

05:53.320 --> 05:55.320
The reconstruction is
more complicated than that.

05:55.322 --> 05:58.223
Nate: Well, how's it even
going to look down there?

05:58.225 --> 05:59.157
His... His thing?

05:59.159 --> 06:00.759
Can you
make it look...

06:00.761 --> 06:02.594
Can you make it
look normal?

06:02.596 --> 06:05.564
There's a very wide
spectrum of normal,

06:05.566 --> 06:07.532
Uh, as far as
genitalia's concerned.

06:07.534 --> 06:10.268
And I'm not
performing the surgery.

06:10.270 --> 06:11.536
You should get a doctor

06:11.538 --> 06:13.605
Who specializes
in pediatric endocrinology,

06:13.607 --> 06:17.743
Someone who's
performed variations on
this procedure many times.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.778
Nate: So, you're not
really the expert, are you?

06:19.780 --> 06:22.781
I'm not, no...
Not on this
particular, uh, condition.

06:22.783 --> 06:24.649
You're not even
the top dog here, right?

06:24.651 --> 06:26.585
One of the...
The nurses told us
you're new.

06:26.587 --> 06:28.453
To the hospital, sir,
not the profession.

06:28.455 --> 06:30.489
So you can't tell me
with any kind of certainty

06:30.491 --> 06:32.791
If this kid's plumbing
is going to work, will it?

06:32.793 --> 06:34.426
That's so far
down the road, nate.

06:34.428 --> 06:35.660
You don't know a thing
about it, francine!

06:35.662 --> 06:38.497
I'm asking you,
will he be able to perform?

06:38.499 --> 06:40.065
Not in a freak show,
in the bedroom.

06:40.067 --> 06:44.236
In some cases,
hormone therapy's necessary,
testosterone treatments.

06:44.238 --> 06:48.273
In other words,
he's going to need
shots to be a real man.

06:48.275 --> 06:50.375
Erections aren't the
totality of manhood.

06:50.377 --> 06:53.745
If you'll excuse me, sir,
let me make a few calls.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.014
You know
who thinks that?

06:56.016 --> 06:58.517
Men with a little
bit of girl in them.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.419
Nate!
I'm sorry, doctor.

07:00.421 --> 07:01.953
I want you
to cut it off.

07:01.955 --> 07:04.256
Sir, what...
What did you say?
Francine: Nate...

07:04.258 --> 07:05.257
Nate: You can
sew a prick on him

07:05.259 --> 07:06.558
The size of the
empire state building,

07:06.560 --> 07:08.093
And it still won't
make him a man.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.996
He'll never be a man, so...

07:11.597 --> 07:13.799
Cut it off.

07:16.669 --> 07:19.237
Let me tell you
how this is gonna
go, mr. Bombeck.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.206
You and your family
are gonna leave here
in a few days,

07:21.208 --> 07:23.308
And you're gonna
take some time to
become informed...

07:23.310 --> 07:25.177
Let your mouth catch up
with your mind.

07:25.179 --> 07:29.114
And you will
come to accept that
your son... Your son...

07:29.116 --> 07:31.516
Has a condition that can
and will be corrected.

07:31.518 --> 07:35.487
And when you come
back here for the surgery
that's gonna ensure

07:35.489 --> 07:38.623
That his outsides
match who he is inside,

07:38.625 --> 07:41.593
You're gonna thank me
for protecting your child

07:41.595 --> 07:44.830
From your own
poor judgment.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.303
Announcer:
<i>...Unanimous conclusion</i>

07:51.305 --> 07:53.805

07:56.777 --> 07:58.577
Any better?

07:58.579 --> 08:00.145

08:00.147 --> 08:01.213
Jesus!

08:01.215 --> 08:03.081

Hello.

08:12.459 --> 08:14.125
(chuckles)

08:14.127 --> 08:15.694
Just fixing your picture.

08:15.696 --> 08:17.896
I'll be out of here.

08:17.898 --> 08:18.897
Jesus!

08:18.899 --> 08:20.532
I'm sorry.

08:20.534 --> 08:22.734
It's only the first round.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.236
I see.

08:24.238 --> 08:26.271
Of how many, exactly?

08:26.273 --> 08:27.105
15.

08:27.107 --> 08:28.173
If he makes it that long.

08:28.175 --> 08:32.244
Been knocked down
two times already.

08:33.379 --> 08:34.412
Three.

08:34.414 --> 08:36.381
Well...

08:36.383 --> 08:39.217
Got it up and working.

08:39.785 --> 08:41.152
Oh, not necessary, sir.

08:41.154 --> 08:43.255
Y'all have
a good night, now.

08:43.257 --> 08:45.223
<i>One minute</i>

08:45.225 --> 08:49.761
<i>One minute!</i>

<i>Tries to move in</i>
<i>and going...</i>

08:53.100 --> 08:53.965
(door closes)
so...

08:53.967 --> 08:57.469
Are we going to
get to work, or...

08:57.471 --> 08:59.905
<i>Down three times.</i>

08:59.907 --> 09:02.741
<i>If archie moore</i>

09:02.743 --> 09:05.744
<i>It will be</i>
<i>boxing's modern miracle.</i>

09:05.746 --> 09:08.780
Fine. Then I'm going
to take a bath.

09:08.782 --> 09:11.483
Fix me one of those drinks.
I'll try to catch up.

09:11.485 --> 09:14.519
<i>10 seconds.</i>
<i>Archie moore...</i>

09:25.565 --> 09:28.600
(breathing heavily)

09:39.011 --> 09:41.546
(grunting)

09:59.465 --> 10:00.265
(baby coos)

10:00.267 --> 10:04.736
You know, "hello,
how was your day?"

10:04.738 --> 10:07.505
Is also a good opener.

10:10.543 --> 10:13.612
Perhaps you would
like me to go first.

10:13.614 --> 10:15.947
Terrible, my day.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.449
Yours?

10:17.451 --> 10:19.317
Without incident.

10:19.319 --> 10:23.989
Until five minutes ago,
when a man I barely recognize

10:23.991 --> 10:27.459
Threw me up against a wall
and had his way with me.

10:27.461 --> 10:28.126
Make note of it.

10:28.128 --> 10:31.262
Subjects, vertical.
Penetration,
standard frontal.

10:31.264 --> 10:34.799
Male affect, angry.

10:36.035 --> 10:37.369
I'm not angry.

10:37.371 --> 10:38.336
No?

10:38.338 --> 10:39.971
I'm...

10:40.473 --> 10:42.007
What?

10:43.943 --> 10:47.512
You hungry?
I could call room service.

10:47.514 --> 10:50.715
(boxing announcer
continues indistinctly)

10:53.152 --> 10:56.221
What happened
today, bill?

10:56.989 --> 11:02.761
I delivered
a baby with ambiguous
sexual genitalia.

11:02.763 --> 11:03.528
Ambiguous?

11:03.530 --> 11:05.997
What does that mean?
You can't tell what it is?

11:05.999 --> 11:09.467
It had both
a penis and a vagina.

11:09.469 --> 11:10.502
It happens in utero,

11:10.504 --> 11:14.806
Depending on
the fetal genitals'
exposure to testosterone.

11:14.808 --> 11:18.276
In its absence,
in a boy, the genitals
remain feminized.

11:18.278 --> 11:21.146
With a girl,
an abundance
of testosterone

11:21.148 --> 11:24.149
Causes the clitoris
to grow into a penis

11:24.151 --> 11:28.687
And the labia fuse
to form a penile urethra.

11:28.689 --> 11:31.589
It's rare,
but it happens.

11:31.591 --> 11:33.191
In med school,
I saw a few photographs.

11:33.193 --> 11:36.494
Over the years,
I've read a paper or two
on the condition.

11:36.496 --> 11:37.495
But...

11:37.497 --> 11:38.697
(spectators cheering)

11:38.699 --> 11:43.168
...I'd never seen it
firsthand before today.

11:45.071 --> 11:46.905
The tests say it's
a boy, which is lucky,

11:46.907 --> 11:50.575
Because sometimes
the genetics aren't so clear.

11:50.577 --> 11:52.644
What happens then?

11:52.646 --> 11:55.880
Well, from
a surgical standpoint,

11:55.882 --> 11:59.517
It's easier...
Much easier to
make it into a girl.

11:59.519 --> 12:01.352
So that's...
That's what they do?

12:01.354 --> 12:06.357
They... They just
make it a girl on the
basis of convenience?

12:06.359 --> 12:07.392
Yes.

12:07.394 --> 12:08.059
And fear.

12:08.061 --> 12:13.598
This, uh, father
wasn't a man who
could handle ambiguity.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.267
Let's put it like that.

12:17.303 --> 12:18.403
He's a bully.

12:18.405 --> 12:22.607
I could see it in the way
he spoke to his wife...

12:23.275 --> 12:25.910
How cowed the woman was...

12:25.912 --> 12:28.513
How he just expected
his bidding to be done.

12:28.515 --> 12:30.315
"cut it off," he told me.

12:30.317 --> 12:32.984
As if you'd alter
your son's genetic destiny

12:32.986 --> 12:35.553
For the sake
of expedience

12:35.555 --> 12:39.491
Because he wasn't hung
to your satisfaction.

12:39.493 --> 12:41.459
(sighs)

12:41.461 --> 12:43.394
How did you leave it?

12:43.396 --> 12:47.665
I put a call in to
a specialist in chicago.

12:47.667 --> 12:51.169
We have
an appointment to
speak in the morning.

12:51.171 --> 12:53.171
(bell dings)

12:53.173 --> 12:56.274
(spectators cheer)

12:56.276 --> 12:57.776
Round 3.

12:57.778 --> 13:01.546
(announcer speaks
indistinctly)

13:03.349 --> 13:04.516
Announcer:
<i>Waiting for a chance</i>

13:04.518 --> 13:07.652
<i>To get that</i>
<i>crushing right hand</i>
<i>home once again,</i>

13:07.654 --> 13:10.155
<i>A chance that has</i>
<i>not come his way...</i>

13:10.157 --> 13:12.791
Maybe they just
need to name him.

13:12.793 --> 13:17.362
And once he has
a boy's name, he'll be
a boy to his father.

13:17.364 --> 13:21.032
Isn't that what every
man wants, a son?

13:21.400 --> 13:22.834
<i>From a near-disastrous</i>
<i>first round</i>

13:22.836 --> 13:25.970
<i>That all began</i>
<i>with a tremendous right...</i>

13:25.972 --> 13:28.907
Unless it needs to be
a certain kind of son,

13:28.909 --> 13:32.410
Male through and through,
like these two,

13:32.412 --> 13:35.079
Pummeling each other
like a...

13:35.081 --> 13:37.215
A butcher
tenderizing meat.

13:37.217 --> 13:38.149
(chuckles)

13:38.151 --> 13:40.785
Male like that.

13:46.025 --> 13:47.959
I wouldn't want
that kind of son.

13:47.961 --> 13:52.230
Or, for that matter,
that kind of man.

13:52.232 --> 13:54.299
You're not like that.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.170
You're not.

14:07.613 --> 14:09.147
I'm ordering.

14:09.149 --> 14:09.848
Bill, in the meantime,

14:09.850 --> 14:11.416
Would you mind
turning the water
back on?

14:11.418 --> 14:15.854
I can't pass up
a soak in a tub
free of bath toys.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.622
(rotary telephone dialing)

14:17.624 --> 14:18.790
Good evening.

14:18.792 --> 14:21.025
Yes, room 412.

14:21.027 --> 14:24.696
Uh, I would like
to order two filets,

14:24.698 --> 14:28.800
Baked potatoes...
Butter, no sour cream.

14:28.802 --> 14:32.136
Oh, medium well for me
and for my husband,

14:32.138 --> 14:32.871
He likes to say,

14:32.873 --> 14:38.476
"the chef can
just walk the cow
through a warm room."

14:38.478 --> 14:40.245
(chuckles)

14:42.114 --> 14:45.383
Oh, yes. Very much
the life of the party.

14:45.385 --> 14:48.319
Thank you so much.

14:50.756 --> 14:53.258
Dinner's on its way.

14:54.960 --> 14:59.597
(announcer continues
indistinctly)

15:01.333 --> 15:03.868
<i>...In favor of durelle,</i>
<i>a canadian boy.</i>

15:03.870 --> 15:06.938
<i>But moore will be</i>
<i>able to fend off</i>

15:06.940 --> 15:09.540
<i>That pungent attack</i>
<i>coming by durelle.</i>

15:09.542 --> 15:11.776
Doesn't seem
like a fair fight.

15:11.778 --> 15:13.878
The colored fighter's
obviously outmatched.

15:13.880 --> 15:15.246
Dr. Masters: Well,
he's the champion...

15:15.248 --> 15:18.149
The one getting
the stuffing knocked
out of him.

15:18.151 --> 15:19.617
He's the champ?
That one?

15:19.619 --> 15:21.886
Archie moore.
The old mongoose.

15:21.888 --> 15:25.623
He said he'd
retire from fighting if
he didn't keep the title.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.458
He's got 15 years
on that kid...

15:27.460 --> 15:29.260
Yvon durelle,
the fighting fisherman.

15:29.262 --> 15:34.632
Apparently, he's been
hauling lobster traps...

15:34.634 --> 15:36.834
To get in shape.

15:36.836 --> 15:38.836
He's the crowd
favorite, hmm?

15:38.838 --> 15:39.804
Listen to them.

15:39.806 --> 15:40.505
(spectators cheering)

15:40.507 --> 15:42.507
It's a good thing
for moore.

15:42.509 --> 15:44.609
It's what's spurring
him on, in part...

15:44.611 --> 15:47.312
People rooting
against him.

15:47.314 --> 15:50.548
Gives him more to prove.

15:50.550 --> 15:51.215
Now, you see that?

15:51.217 --> 15:53.284
That's, uh,
that's his signature move...

15:53.286 --> 15:54.218
The armadillo curtain.

15:54.220 --> 15:56.955
See how he crosses his
arms across his chest?

15:56.957 --> 15:59.357
That's not the
usual fighting stance.

15:59.359 --> 16:00.525
Can throw
an opponent off.

16:00.527 --> 16:03.361
And then see?
The right jab comes
out of nowhere.

16:03.363 --> 16:04.996
But durelle's
not falling... What?

16:04.998 --> 16:07.899
I didn't know you knew
anything about boxing.

16:07.901 --> 16:08.499
Yes, well...

16:08.501 --> 16:11.302
I've never seen you
so much as glance
at the sports page.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.504
Well, we don't have
breakfast together, do we?

16:13.506 --> 16:16.441
(announcer continues
indistinctly)

16:21.981 --> 16:24.649
(spectators cheering)

16:25.684 --> 16:27.051
I learned to box
at boarding school.

16:27.053 --> 16:31.389
It was the
first thing I did after
I unpacked my suitcase.

16:31.391 --> 16:33.391
Headed down to the gym

16:33.393 --> 16:38.796
And asked the coach
to teach me how to fight.

16:39.932 --> 16:40.798
Why?

16:40.800 --> 16:41.966
What's that?

16:41.968 --> 16:45.103
Why first thing?

16:49.074 --> 16:50.575
I don't know.

16:50.577 --> 16:53.211
I was enamored
with the sport.

16:53.213 --> 16:57.915
Was it something
that you enjoyed
with your father?

16:57.917 --> 16:59.317
Enjoyed? No.

16:59.319 --> 17:00.685
For christ's sake!

17:00.687 --> 17:03.621
He didn't take
you to the fights?

17:03.822 --> 17:05.623
Well, then how did you
get interested, then?

17:05.625 --> 17:07.191
I don't know.
Just the usual.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.761
The schoolyard
scrapes and then...

17:09.763 --> 17:12.296
I just wanted to learn
how to hold my own

17:12.298 --> 17:15.199
In case there
was freshman hazing.

17:15.201 --> 17:16.401
And was there?

17:16.403 --> 17:19.037
Were you picked
on as a child?

17:19.039 --> 17:20.171
Never lost a fight.

17:20.173 --> 17:23.041
What was the worst
fight that you ever got...

17:23.043 --> 17:23.574
Just the usual.

17:23.576 --> 17:26.544
There's really not
an interesting story
here, virginia.

17:26.546 --> 17:27.578
I promise you.

17:27.580 --> 17:29.881
(spectators cheering)

17:34.720 --> 17:35.853
<i>Durelle's left got home,</i>

17:35.855 --> 17:37.722
<i>But that right that</i>
<i>came some time later,</i>

17:37.724 --> 17:39.824
<i>Again, glanced off the</i>
<i>glove of archie moore.</i>

17:39.826 --> 17:43.428
(announcer continues
indistinctly)

17:45.531 --> 17:50.568
<i>...Amazing display</i>
<i>of boxing...</i>

17:50.570 --> 17:53.337
(knocking on door)

17:58.911 --> 18:00.244
<i>After weathering</i>
<i>the storm...</i>

18:00.246 --> 18:02.146
Where would you
like it, dr. Holden?

18:02.148 --> 18:03.614
On the table is good.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.349
Very good, sir.

18:05.351 --> 18:05.983
<i>...Durelle,</i>

18:05.985 --> 18:08.486
<i>And regaining his</i>
<i>strength and his clarity.</i>

18:08.488 --> 18:12.457
<i>Moore starting to move on</i>
<i>after durelle in round 4.</i>

18:12.459 --> 18:13.524
(spectators cheering)

18:13.526 --> 18:15.493
<i>Durelle came in with a...</i>

18:15.495 --> 18:16.561
Jesus! Get up!

18:16.563 --> 18:18.596
<i>And moore</i>
<i>is down again.</i>

18:18.598 --> 18:22.033
Durelle just took him
out with a right hook.

18:22.035 --> 18:25.536
We got a few bets
going in the kitchen.

18:25.538 --> 18:26.404
Where's your money?

18:26.406 --> 18:28.739
On the kid.
Archie's way
past his prime.

18:28.741 --> 18:30.975
I wouldn't
count him out.

18:30.977 --> 18:31.442
Really?

18:31.444 --> 18:33.845
You think those legs
are gonna hold him up?

18:33.847 --> 18:35.646
<i>Archie moore wobbly.</i>
<i>Moore trying to hold on.</i>

18:35.648 --> 18:39.150
Will both of you be
having wine tonight?

18:39.152 --> 18:41.719
I can pour it.
Thank you.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.788
Very good, sir.

18:44.289 --> 18:45.756
Uh, it's elliot, sir.

18:45.758 --> 18:49.093
Sometimes they
put me on the door.

18:49.095 --> 18:52.196
I brought mrs. Holden
that umbrella last time.

18:52.198 --> 18:53.631
Yes,
thank you for that.

18:53.633 --> 18:58.536
How's her mother
doing, if I may ask?

18:58.538 --> 18:59.270
Same.

18:59.272 --> 19:01.806
It's hard to know
what to wish for, isn't it?

19:01.808 --> 19:04.175
My mother lingered
for a long time,

19:04.177 --> 19:07.845
But she was in
terrible, terrible pain.

19:08.614 --> 19:10.081
Yes, well...

19:10.083 --> 19:15.153
Will you and your wife
be wanting a breakfast tray
in the morning?

19:15.155 --> 19:16.387
Uh, we both
have long drives,

19:16.389 --> 19:19.557
So we like to be
on the road early.

19:19.559 --> 19:22.160
Thank you for
your trouble, uh...

19:22.162 --> 19:23.661
Elliot.

19:24.496 --> 19:25.830
My pleasure, dr. Holden.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.365
Now, you just give a call
when you're done,

19:27.367 --> 19:30.868
And I'll get this out of
your way lickety-split, sir.

19:30.870 --> 19:31.802
<i>...Dramatic thing this is</i>

19:31.804 --> 19:36.474
<i>Here in this ring</i>
<i>at the forum in</i>
<i>montreal, canada.</i>

19:36.476 --> 19:37.108
<i>Archie moore</i>

19:37.110 --> 19:40.845
<i>Defending his</i>
<i>light heavyweight</i>
<i>championship of the world.</i>

19:40.847 --> 19:41.479
Where are we going

19:41.481 --> 19:43.548
That we need
to leave in the
middle of the night?

19:43.550 --> 19:45.950
You are driving
to louisville

19:45.952 --> 19:47.351
To take care
of your mother,

19:47.353 --> 19:51.556
And I am driving back
to my medical practice

19:51.558 --> 19:52.757
In kansas city.

19:52.759 --> 19:55.993
We meet halfway
when we can.

19:55.995 --> 19:58.429
And what's wrong
with my mother?

19:58.431 --> 20:00.765
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

20:00.767 --> 20:02.366
Oh, sour cream! Terrific.

20:02.368 --> 20:03.868
You told them, right?

20:03.870 --> 20:04.902
Idiopathic?

20:04.904 --> 20:06.604
That's right.

20:06.606 --> 20:08.906
Idiopathic.

20:10.242 --> 20:11.842
And what kind
of doctor are you?

20:11.844 --> 20:14.111
No, wait.
Let me guess.

20:14.113 --> 20:15.546
An ophthalmologist.

20:15.548 --> 20:16.681
Radiologist.

20:16.683 --> 20:17.748
Oh. Radiologist.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.083
Well, I guess
neither one of us

20:19.085 --> 20:22.587
Has a particularly
interesting story, do we?

20:23.288 --> 20:24.088
You couldn't come up

20:24.090 --> 20:26.757
With something
slightly more imaginative?

20:26.759 --> 20:27.358
Why would I?

20:27.360 --> 20:30.027
Isn't the point that
we fly under the radar,

20:30.029 --> 20:34.131
Just an ordinary
husband and wife
meeting for a...

20:34.133 --> 20:38.536
Ho-hum marital assignation.

20:38.971 --> 20:42.506
My mother doesn't
have pulmonary fibrosis.

20:42.508 --> 20:43.140
Idiopathic.

20:43.142 --> 20:45.643
She was blinded
in a prison fight,

20:45.645 --> 20:48.879
Where she's serving time
for tax evasion

20:48.881 --> 20:52.917
And also for
contributing to the
delinquency of a minor

20:52.919 --> 20:56.554
When she tried to
seduce the bag boy
at the piggly wiggly.

20:56.556 --> 21:00.258
I go down to louisville
as often as I can to
read her the bible,

21:00.260 --> 21:04.595
Hoping to make
her right with the lord.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.734
I see.

21:09.736 --> 21:10.901
And me?

21:10.903 --> 21:12.870
You are a radiologist.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.605
I thought you
just said that...

21:14.607 --> 21:18.576
Who's working for
the government covertly

21:18.578 --> 21:20.278
On a...

21:21.113 --> 21:23.314
On a pen.

21:23.316 --> 21:24.382
A radioactive pen

21:24.384 --> 21:26.284
That will be smuggled
into the kremlin

21:26.286 --> 21:30.321
Via a soviet diplomat,
one gustav antonovich.

21:30.323 --> 21:32.490
"gustav" isn't russian.
It's german.

21:32.492 --> 21:33.190
His mother was german.

21:33.192 --> 21:36.327
And this device
will be used to
take out khrushchev.

21:36.329 --> 21:37.962
It's a top-secret mission.

21:37.964 --> 21:44.235
Perhaps that's why ...
I didn't, uh,
mention it to...

21:46.672 --> 21:48.272
...Elliot.

21:48.274 --> 21:49.307
Our waiter.

21:49.309 --> 21:54.111
That boy didn't
hit you up for
a loan again, did he?

21:54.113 --> 21:57.448
Far too generous
with the staff, jason.

21:57.450 --> 22:00.051
Francis.
(chuckling) francis?

22:00.053 --> 22:01.319
Francis.

22:01.321 --> 22:03.287
And I'm...

22:03.289 --> 22:05.389
You...

22:05.391 --> 22:07.491
Do not have a name.

22:07.493 --> 22:09.226
(chuckles)

22:09.228 --> 22:09.794
I see.

22:09.796 --> 22:13.998
Generous with
everybody except the
old ball and chain.

22:14.000 --> 22:14.732
You're just still upset

22:14.734 --> 22:19.537
Because I bought
our daughter a pony for
her birthday, aren't you?

22:19.539 --> 22:21.472
We don't have children.

22:21.474 --> 22:27.411
It wouldn't be fair...
Not with the lives we lead.

22:29.047 --> 22:29.647
Of course.

22:29.649 --> 22:31.882
The, uh,
clandestine missions,

22:31.884 --> 22:36.387
The prison visits
to your deranged mother.

22:38.890 --> 22:41.559
You're making fun of me.

22:41.561 --> 22:46.230
Aren't you
making fun of us?

22:51.470 --> 22:54.438
I don't...
I don't know.

22:54.440 --> 22:57.742
What are we?
Are we this?

22:57.744 --> 23:00.077
This?
This.

23:00.079 --> 23:02.680
This mr. "steak very rare,"

23:02.682 --> 23:06.217
Mrs. "wouldn't this wallpaper
look good in our den?"

23:06.219 --> 23:09.720
I just had you
up against the wall
in our bathroom.

23:09.722 --> 23:12.390
That doesn't exactly
qualify us for the cover

23:12.392 --> 23:16.794
Of the  <i>Saturday</i>
<i>evening post,</i> does it?

23:19.164 --> 23:21.499
Did you like that?

23:22.534 --> 23:24.502
I did.

23:25.537 --> 23:29.340
I liked how you
had me standing up...

23:29.342 --> 23:31.642
Dr. Holden...

23:31.644 --> 23:35.146
Of the kansas city holdens.

23:36.515 --> 23:40.851
We might look like
white-picket-fence types,

23:40.853 --> 23:44.655
But we're not.

23:46.458 --> 23:49.927
There's nothing
ho-hum about us.

23:49.929 --> 23:52.029
(spectators shouting)

23:57.235 --> 24:00.271
(baby crying)

24:01.807 --> 24:04.975
(x-ray machine whirs)

24:10.015 --> 24:14.018
(crying continues)
(x-ray machine clicking)

24:15.420 --> 24:19.256
<i>It looks as though</i>
<i>he's beginning to</i>
<i>step up the pace...</i>

24:19.258 --> 24:23.194
You surprise me,
mrs. Holden.

24:23.196 --> 24:24.795
Lydia.

24:24.797 --> 24:25.563
Lydia.

24:25.565 --> 24:27.565
In what way
do I surprise you?

24:27.567 --> 24:28.833
Your appetite.

24:28.835 --> 24:30.034
I skipped lunch.

24:30.036 --> 24:33.304
Not that kind
of appetite.

24:36.141 --> 24:38.042
Well, surely
you didn't think

24:38.044 --> 24:41.912
You taught me
everything I know,
did you, francis?

24:41.914 --> 24:48.018
Oh, I'm...
I'm aware there were
others before me.

24:48.020 --> 24:50.154
Boys. Right?

24:50.156 --> 24:51.121
A boy or two.

24:51.123 --> 24:55.192
After all these years,
dear husband, you're asking?

24:55.194 --> 24:56.861
No. I'm not asking.

24:56.863 --> 24:59.830
On the other hand,
if there's something
you want to tell me...

24:59.832 --> 25:02.867
Maybe you would
feel threatened.

25:02.869 --> 25:05.469
Oh. Why would that be?

25:05.471 --> 25:09.840
You married me,
after all, didn't you?

25:14.346 --> 25:16.347
Well...

25:16.948 --> 25:18.115
There were others.

25:18.117 --> 25:19.717
Boys, yes.

25:19.719 --> 25:22.553
But only one
man that counted.

25:22.555 --> 25:24.688
I wasn't quite 18,

25:24.690 --> 25:27.124
And I was still
living at home in...

25:27.126 --> 25:28.893
Where am I from,
again... Nashville?

25:28.895 --> 25:30.861
Louisville.
Louisville. Right.

25:30.863 --> 25:33.731
I was in louisville
at this public pool

25:33.733 --> 25:36.534
That my girlfriend susannah
and I liked to go to.

25:36.536 --> 25:39.203
You remember
susannah, don't you?

25:39.205 --> 25:41.805
Looks like
eleanor roosevelt?

25:41.807 --> 25:42.606
(chuckles)

25:42.608 --> 25:44.608
She was one
of my bridesmaids.

25:44.610 --> 25:46.277
Ah.

25:46.279 --> 25:48.445
So, susannah and I
were splashing around

25:48.447 --> 25:51.515
Like ninnies,
trying to get the
boys to notice us,

25:51.517 --> 25:55.719
When I realized
that I had lost an earring.

25:55.721 --> 25:58.155
It was just some
dime-store piece of junk,

25:58.157 --> 26:02.626
But I had said that
it was real, so I had
to make a big show

26:02.628 --> 26:05.496
Of diving down to
the bottom to get it.

26:05.498 --> 26:08.198
And then suddenly
a shock wave hits.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.367
A man had jumped
into the pool to get it,

26:10.369 --> 26:11.969
But all he had
succeeded in doing

26:11.971 --> 26:14.471
Was sending it
directly down the drain.

26:14.473 --> 26:15.439
Oh. The oaf.

26:15.441 --> 26:17.141
That is exactly
what I said to him...

26:17.143 --> 26:19.376
Right before
I slapped him.

26:21.112 --> 26:22.313
All right,
I didn't slap him,

26:22.315 --> 26:24.782
But I did give him
a very hard time about it

26:24.784 --> 26:28.118
Because...
Well, because
that's what you did

26:28.120 --> 26:30.688
To show that you
were a girl with sass,

26:30.690 --> 26:34.058
Not just some pushover.

26:34.593 --> 26:37.328
Isn't that the quality
that first attracted you

26:37.330 --> 26:39.597
Back when we
were courting?

26:39.599 --> 26:42.600
That can hardly
be the sum of it, though.

26:42.602 --> 26:45.970
Obviously,
you two ran into
each other again.

26:45.972 --> 26:49.974
Yes. At a dance
at the army base.

26:49.976 --> 26:52.943
Turns out
he was a captain.

26:54.713 --> 26:57.581
Lot of shiny buttons
on a captain's uniform.

26:57.583 --> 27:01.986
He took this
worthless, little piece
of colored glass

27:01.988 --> 27:03.854
Out of his pocket.

27:03.856 --> 27:04.888
He'd gotten
the maintenance guy

27:04.890 --> 27:06.657
To fish it out
of the drain for him

27:06.659 --> 27:11.161
And had been
carrying it around in the
hopes of seeing me again.

27:11.163 --> 27:14.832
And he said that he knew
that it was an amethyst

27:14.834 --> 27:18.535
Because that was
his fiance's birthstone.

27:18.537 --> 27:19.436
He was engaged.

27:19.438 --> 27:21.572
Well, he claimed,
which was smart,

27:21.574 --> 27:25.542
All those girls
on the army bases
looking for husbands.

27:25.544 --> 27:27.711
But two days in,

27:27.713 --> 27:33.984
The fiance just...
Disappeared into thin air.

27:34.653 --> 27:38.522
I would make him
take me driving in
his friend's convertible.

27:38.524 --> 27:40.457
We would go driving
to the countryside.

27:40.459 --> 27:42.993
The first time
we made love...

27:42.995 --> 27:46.730
Was in a grove
of honeysuckles.

27:46.732 --> 27:49.033
And the sap
from the blossoms,

27:49.035 --> 27:53.904
The sticky sweetness
mixing with our sweat...

27:53.906 --> 27:56.707
It was...

27:56.709 --> 27:59.410
(chuckles lightly)

27:59.811 --> 28:02.446
<i>Up at the</i>
<i>count of three!</i>

28:02.448 --> 28:03.914
<i>Durelle now...</i>

28:03.916 --> 28:07.451
He knew about things
and had been places.

28:07.453 --> 28:09.086
He taught me
a little french

28:09.088 --> 28:11.655
That he had
picked up over there.

28:11.657 --> 28:13.957
The boys I knew
were farmers

28:13.959 --> 28:18.762
And had spent their lives
looking at the ground.

28:18.764 --> 28:23.934
But this man,
he knew all about astronomy.

28:28.473 --> 28:31.375
I thought to myself,

28:31.377 --> 28:33.243
"oh.

28:33.245 --> 28:37.047
"this is what it is
to be in love.

28:37.049 --> 28:41.852
"you can feel this with
somebody every day.

28:41.854 --> 28:44.588
"it's possible."

28:46.357 --> 28:47.658
And then one day,

28:47.660 --> 28:50.861
He asked me to drive him
to the train station,

28:50.863 --> 28:55.766
And he kissed me,
and he said "thank you."

28:55.768 --> 28:58.268
"thank you."

28:58.270 --> 28:59.737
And he left.

28:59.739 --> 29:01.338
Shipped out?

29:01.340 --> 29:02.873
No.

29:02.875 --> 29:05.409
He left to get married.

29:12.951 --> 29:13.817
(chuckles lightly)

29:13.819 --> 29:16.820
Well, he did say
he was engaged.

29:17.622 --> 29:19.490
Once.

29:19.492 --> 29:22.226
He said he was
engaged once.

29:22.228 --> 29:25.696
And then he never
spoke of it again,

29:25.698 --> 29:28.265
Not for a whole year.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.834
Never even mentioned
another woman's name

29:30.836 --> 29:33.036
Until the day
he left to marry her.

29:33.038 --> 29:36.540
Why wouldn't I
be surprised?

29:38.543 --> 29:41.612
If you find yourself
standing atop a hill

29:41.614 --> 29:42.846
Overlooking
a beautiful valley

29:42.848 --> 29:48.685
And you say,
"I want a house with
a view exactly like this,"

29:48.687 --> 29:49.753
And he says,

29:49.755 --> 29:52.055
"it's the second thing
I want to see

29:52.057 --> 29:56.527
"every single morning,
after you"...

29:57.262 --> 30:00.197
Aren't the two of you
imagining the same future?

30:00.199 --> 30:04.968
Where is there room for
a fiance in that house?

30:07.906 --> 30:14.144
Well, it turns out
she's downstairs
making oatmeal,

30:14.146 --> 30:19.449
Waiting for him to
wash you off his skin.

30:24.189 --> 30:26.590
And so...

30:29.194 --> 30:29.993
Sex? Fine.

30:29.995 --> 30:33.664
Enjoy it if
and when you can.
It's a biological function.

30:33.666 --> 30:36.600
But play it safe.

30:36.602 --> 30:38.068
Keep your
heart out of it,

30:38.070 --> 30:43.807
Locked away
someplace safe,
like a bank vault.

30:43.809 --> 30:47.277
So what does
that say about us?

30:48.947 --> 30:50.881
Us?

30:50.883 --> 30:53.250
About our marriage.

30:59.123 --> 31:01.024
Oh, darling.

31:01.026 --> 31:04.328
Don't you know I would
never marry a man

31:04.330 --> 31:10.000
I didn't both
love and desire?

31:13.238 --> 31:14.771
(spectators cheering)

31:14.773 --> 31:17.941
(announcer speaking
indistinctly)

31:25.516 --> 31:27.918
(baby crying)

31:50.341 --> 31:53.410
Announcer:  <i>And</i>
<i>it's round number 6.</i>

31:53.412 --> 31:54.144
<i>This is archie moore,</i>

31:54.146 --> 31:56.280
<i>Who was standing</i>
<i>up all through the</i>
<i>between-round period,</i>

31:56.282 --> 32:00.284
<i>Once again trying to</i>
<i>take a psychological shot</i>

32:00.286 --> 32:00.851
<i>At yvon durelle.</i>

32:00.853 --> 32:05.322
<i>Refusing to show</i>
<i>any sign of weakness,</i>
<i>any sign of fatigue.</i>

32:05.324 --> 32:07.557
My father
would occasionally

32:07.559 --> 32:09.059
Listen to the fights
on the radio,

32:09.061 --> 32:13.764
But I could never get
a picture in my head.

32:13.766 --> 32:15.432
It's different
than I thought.

32:15.434 --> 32:19.202
Sure, when they belt
each other and fall down,

32:19.204 --> 32:20.170
That's something,

32:20.172 --> 32:24.474
But this going
'round and 'round
in circles,

32:24.476 --> 32:26.343
Eyeballing each other,

32:26.345 --> 32:27.511
That's most of it.

32:27.513 --> 32:29.346
This is the best part.

32:29.348 --> 32:30.213
This?
Yeah.

32:30.215 --> 32:34.484
There's an entire
unspoken conversation
happening between them.

32:34.486 --> 32:35.585
"please stand still
so I can hit you"?

32:35.587 --> 32:39.289
They're telling
each other what they
think of each other.

32:39.291 --> 32:40.624
See there?

32:40.626 --> 32:42.426
When he keeps his
gloves down like that?

32:42.428 --> 32:44.594
Doesn't mean he's tired.
He looks tired.

32:44.596 --> 32:46.730
But it
doesn't necessarily
mean he is tired.

32:46.732 --> 32:49.199
Might be a...
An invitation to
his opponent

32:49.201 --> 32:50.434
To take a shot,
free and clear.

32:50.436 --> 32:53.937
When you invite
a punch, you're saying
you can take it.

32:53.939 --> 32:59.009
So what looks
like vulnerability is
exactly the opposite.

32:59.011 --> 32:59.743
By playing weak,

32:59.745 --> 33:02.312
You're saying,
"I'm stronger than you."

33:02.314 --> 33:06.883
Now.
See, that is an insult.
Moore just insulted him.

33:06.885 --> 33:08.452
He did? How?
A right-hand lead.

33:08.454 --> 33:10.087
It's a right punch
thrown like a jab,

33:10.089 --> 33:11.221
But you don't
set up with your left.

33:11.223 --> 33:15.993
You're saying to
your opponent, "I don't
think much of you."

33:17.362 --> 33:18.862
(sighs)

33:18.864 --> 33:21.064
I don't understand.

33:21.766 --> 33:24.801
Well, come here.
I'll show you.

33:24.803 --> 33:27.904
(announcer speaking
indistinctly)

33:29.307 --> 33:31.608
Okay.
So, put up your dukes.

33:31.610 --> 33:34.911
(scoffs)
they really say that?

33:40.918 --> 33:43.553
Now, when I come
at you like this,

33:43.555 --> 33:44.287
With a right-hand lead,

33:44.289 --> 33:47.491
See how far
my fist has to travel
through space, all...

33:47.493 --> 33:48.925
All this extra distance

33:48.927 --> 33:50.193
Past your shoulders?
So?

33:50.195 --> 33:51.962
So, that's the time
you have to respond.

33:51.964 --> 33:54.131
If you see
something coming,
you can stop it.

33:54.133 --> 33:55.966
All right, well,
how do I do that?

33:55.968 --> 33:57.067
You don't.
It's coming too fast.

33:57.069 --> 33:59.603
You just said that I could...
That I could see it coming.

33:59.605 --> 34:01.338
Yes, but the fact
that I'm throwing

34:01.340 --> 34:05.208
A right-hand lead
proves to you that
I think that you won't.

34:05.210 --> 34:05.942
I think you'll miss it.

34:05.944 --> 34:08.311
That's how little I think
of your reflexes.

34:08.313 --> 34:10.680
And that undermines
a fighter's confidence.

34:10.682 --> 34:13.517
Well, I would
prove you wrong.

34:15.386 --> 34:17.454
Want to try?

34:18.689 --> 34:19.456
Seriously?

34:19.458 --> 34:24.061
I'll take a shot.
You try and block it.

34:24.063 --> 34:26.263
Okay.

34:30.802 --> 34:32.636
Too slow.

34:32.638 --> 34:34.604
Try again.

34:38.976 --> 34:40.811
Ah, too late.
You'd be down on the mat.

34:40.813 --> 34:41.678
Let me...
Let me be you.

34:41.680 --> 34:45.015
I'll throw the punch, and...
And you try to block it.

34:45.017 --> 34:46.817
(chuckles) okay.

34:46.819 --> 34:48.385
All right,
like this, right?

34:48.387 --> 34:50.353
You're gonna
do it at that speed?

34:50.355 --> 34:51.988
No, bill, I'm not.

34:51.990 --> 34:54.157
All right,
here we go.

34:54.159 --> 34:55.659
One, two...

34:55.661 --> 34:56.326
Don't count it off.

34:56.328 --> 34:58.762
You got to use
the element of surprise.

34:58.764 --> 35:00.430
Fine.

35:05.103 --> 35:07.938
Try again.

35:07.940 --> 35:09.372
(laughs)

35:09.374 --> 35:12.342
It's not funny.

35:19.550 --> 35:20.617
Once more.

35:20.619 --> 35:21.885
Come on, gini.

35:21.887 --> 35:24.187
Once more!

35:24.189 --> 35:26.523
(sighs)

35:31.129 --> 35:31.661
Ow! Ow! Ow!

35:31.663 --> 35:34.598
Jesus! Don't...
Don't move! What...
What is that?

35:34.600 --> 35:35.298
My bracelet snagged.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.234
Well, slide...
Can you slide it off?

35:37.236 --> 35:38.702
No, it's...
It's too tight.

35:38.704 --> 35:40.370
Jesus!
Wait, let me just...

35:40.372 --> 35:42.439
Just unhook
the clasp, virginia!

35:42.441 --> 35:43.173
I'm trying, bill!

35:43.175 --> 35:44.641
What the hell
are you doing?

35:44.643 --> 35:45.942
You're supposed to
hit me with your right.

35:45.944 --> 35:48.879
Well, maybe if you
had quicker reflexes...

35:48.881 --> 35:50.280
There's too much
hair stuck in it. Um...

35:50.282 --> 35:53.917
Do you...
Do you have nail
shears in your purse?

35:53.919 --> 35:54.484
No.

35:54.486 --> 35:56.286
Um, I could
call the front desk

35:56.288 --> 35:58.088
And... And have them
send up a pair of scissors.

35:58.090 --> 36:00.824
Oh, so you're all right
with us answering
the door like this?

36:00.826 --> 36:03.627
Well, what do
you propose, bill?

36:06.531 --> 36:08.398
All right,
come here.

36:08.400 --> 36:09.833
No. No.

36:09.835 --> 36:10.400
Ah!

36:10.402 --> 36:13.937
All right.
Just have to saw it out.

36:17.241 --> 36:21.545
Housekeeping sent up a pair.

36:21.547 --> 36:23.446
Come here.

36:23.448 --> 36:24.581
Sit.

36:24.583 --> 36:25.515
You're gonna
make it worse.

36:25.517 --> 36:28.485
Bill, you have a divot
on the side of your head.

36:28.487 --> 36:31.121
How much worse
can I make it?

36:31.123 --> 36:34.558
I'm just going to
even it out a bit.

36:36.027 --> 36:38.028
Ridiculous.

36:38.030 --> 36:39.196
What is?

36:39.198 --> 36:40.564
You are.

36:40.566 --> 36:42.365
I am?

36:42.367 --> 36:44.034
You enjoyed that.

36:44.036 --> 36:45.202
No.
Yes.

36:45.204 --> 36:49.039
You liked making me
feel pathetic, weak.

36:49.041 --> 36:50.574
Well, you are weak.

36:50.576 --> 36:52.008
Weaker.

36:52.010 --> 36:55.745
Well, then,
it was an unfair fight.

36:55.747 --> 36:57.914
It was a game, virginia.

36:57.916 --> 37:00.517
You're just upset
because you lost.

37:00.519 --> 37:01.685
If you'd won,
you'd be gloating.

37:01.687 --> 37:03.887
I would not.
Yes, you would.

37:04.722 --> 37:05.322
Feels good.

37:05.324 --> 37:08.124
And it feels
even better when the
odds are against you.

37:08.126 --> 37:10.827
Really?
Did they teach you that
in boarding school?

37:10.829 --> 37:13.863
No. I knew it
before I went there.

37:15.633 --> 37:19.336
Old francis holden sr.
Prepared me well.

37:19.338 --> 37:22.105
So, he did take
you to the fights.

37:22.107 --> 37:23.206
No.

37:23.208 --> 37:29.012
In fact,
he didn't take me
much of anywhere.

37:29.014 --> 37:32.015
New york city once.

37:32.017 --> 37:34.150
When I was 14.

37:34.152 --> 37:37.487
En route to dropping
me at boarding school.

37:37.489 --> 37:40.023
He didn't buy you
a woman, did he?

37:40.025 --> 37:42.058
Please tell me
that he didn't buy
you a woman.

37:42.060 --> 37:44.327
No, he bought me
a shave and a haircut

37:44.329 --> 37:49.132
At the barbershop
at the waldorf astoria.

37:49.134 --> 37:51.034
My first.

37:51.036 --> 37:52.736
He got one, too.

37:52.738 --> 37:58.642
We sat there side by side,
father and son,

37:58.644 --> 38:02.045
Steaming towels
on our faces.

38:02.047 --> 38:06.016
No feeling in
the world like walking
out into central park

38:06.018 --> 38:08.385
On a fall day
after a fresh shave.

38:08.387 --> 38:12.155
Wanted to send
you off in style, huh?

38:12.157 --> 38:16.660
Oh, he was a character.

38:16.662 --> 38:18.628
My father.

38:21.165 --> 38:23.166
He could have
been a boxer.

38:23.168 --> 38:26.303
Not too much control
in his punches, mind you,

38:26.305 --> 38:30.874
But he was a master
at the feint.

38:30.876 --> 38:33.543
Just when you thought
he was one thing,

38:33.545 --> 38:34.878
Like the kind of swell guy

38:34.880 --> 38:38.982
Who'd show his
kid a good time
in the big city,

38:38.984 --> 38:40.617
Wham!

38:40.619 --> 38:44.621
He'd come out of nowhere,
knock you for a loop.

38:45.556 --> 38:50.093
Leave you on the steps
of the freshman dormitory

38:50.095 --> 38:51.861
With a taxi
idling at the curb,

38:51.863 --> 38:57.801
Letting you know
that you wouldn't be
coming home at christmas.

38:57.803 --> 39:00.770
Or at easter.

39:00.772 --> 39:03.506
Or ever.

39:06.010 --> 39:10.547
Telling you at...
At 14...

39:10.549 --> 39:14.451
It was time you
took care of yourself.

39:18.255 --> 39:21.024
You never went
home after that?

39:25.563 --> 39:28.631
It was the best thing
that could have happened.

39:28.633 --> 39:30.100
Toughened me up.

39:30.102 --> 39:34.003
(sniffs) made me
totally self-reliant.

39:42.279 --> 39:43.913
We both got left.

39:43.915 --> 39:47.851
Well, he didn't
break my heart.

39:47.853 --> 39:48.651
No?

39:48.653 --> 39:52.188
Just my nose.

39:52.190 --> 39:54.791
Once.

39:54.793 --> 39:58.428
A left hook.

40:08.739 --> 40:10.440
He did me a favor.

40:10.442 --> 40:14.043
Made me the man
I am today.

40:14.045 --> 40:17.547
A kansas city radiologist.

40:17.549 --> 40:19.749
(chuckles)

40:34.231 --> 40:38.635
(announcer speaking
indistinctly)

40:41.505 --> 40:43.873
Leave it. Leave it.

40:45.176 --> 40:47.977
Let me look at you.

40:50.347 --> 40:54.117
Take your hands away.

40:54.119 --> 40:56.853
I want to see you.

41:34.425 --> 41:37.427
Are you going
to touch me?

41:41.365 --> 41:44.167
Is that what you want?

41:45.269 --> 41:47.003
Is it?

41:52.743 --> 41:54.110
Tell me.

41:55.346 --> 41:56.279
Say it.

41:56.281 --> 41:58.982
I don't need to say it.

42:00.718 --> 42:03.186
I want you to tell me

42:03.188 --> 42:08.124
How much you want me
to make you feel good.

42:09.527 --> 42:11.461
Do it.

42:12.863 --> 42:14.130
Beg me.

42:14.132 --> 42:16.699
No. I won't.

42:20.437 --> 42:23.806
I can make
myself feel good.

42:50.568 --> 42:53.503
(breathing heavily)

43:13.157 --> 43:16.626
(heavy breathing continues)

43:23.901 --> 43:25.435
(spectators cheering)

43:25.437 --> 43:27.637
(announcer speaking
indistinctly)

43:27.639 --> 43:29.672
Virginia: I can't
tell who's ahead.

43:29.674 --> 43:32.775
Well, it can change
from moment to moment.

43:32.777 --> 43:34.911
But is there
always a clear winner,

43:34.913 --> 43:37.280
Even if there's
not a knockout?

43:37.282 --> 43:38.514
Sometimes the best fighter

43:38.516 --> 43:41.284
Isn't the one who
lands the hardest punch.

43:41.286 --> 43:43.152
Can be the one
who absorbs it.

43:43.154 --> 43:44.988
You'd have to
be a masochist

43:44.990 --> 43:49.092
To endure that
kind of punishment,
don't you think?

43:49.094 --> 43:51.828
You stop feeling it
after a while.

43:51.830 --> 43:54.864
What do you mean?
You go numb?

43:54.866 --> 43:57.867
You learn to resist
your body's instinct,

43:57.869 --> 44:00.703
Which is to run, flee.

44:00.705 --> 44:03.840
You start to, uh,
invite that feeling.

44:03.842 --> 44:08.444
You can't control
the punishment,

44:08.446 --> 44:10.813
But you can master
your response.

44:10.815 --> 44:16.419
And that in itself
gives you a kind of power,

44:16.421 --> 44:22.025
That you can take it
and not run.

44:26.163 --> 44:29.098
Why did he
break your nose?

44:30.801 --> 44:31.868
Hmm?

44:31.870 --> 44:33.670
Your father.

44:36.473 --> 44:39.242
Dear, old dad? Oh.

44:39.244 --> 44:42.612
Usual...
Just horsing around.

44:42.614 --> 44:49.018
Indian wrestling,
like fathers and sons do.

44:49.020 --> 44:51.020
Bill.

44:51.789 --> 44:54.691
Why did he
break your nose?

44:57.494 --> 45:00.830
What difference
does it make?

45:00.832 --> 45:03.266
I'm asking you.

45:09.139 --> 45:11.274
I don't remember.

45:14.378 --> 45:19.182
Maybe I slammed
the screen door.

45:19.184 --> 45:20.717
Maybe I, uh,

45:20.719 --> 45:24.821
Reached for a second
helping before he did.

45:24.823 --> 45:29.092
Maybe I used a word
he didn't know.

45:30.561 --> 45:33.629
Maybe it was...

45:33.631 --> 45:35.832
Wednesday.

45:38.235 --> 45:42.371
And you didn't fight back?

45:42.373 --> 45:44.440
Sure I did.

45:44.442 --> 45:47.043
In my own way.

45:47.211 --> 45:52.548
There were plenty
of times I didn't even
put up my hands.

45:52.550 --> 45:54.016
The ultimate insult...

45:54.018 --> 45:58.788
A fighter who
keeps his gloves down.

45:59.389 --> 46:05.895
You're saying, "come on,
you son of a bitch.

46:05.897 --> 46:09.031
"take your best shot.

46:09.500 --> 46:12.301
"just keep
going at me forever,

46:12.303 --> 46:18.307
"until your
knuckles come through
your goddamn skin."

46:18.309 --> 46:24.413
And there was
no one to stop it?

46:24.982 --> 46:27.150
Oh, I could
have stopped it.

46:27.152 --> 46:29.919
He made that
perfectly clear.

46:29.921 --> 46:32.488
"when you get down
on your knees, son,

46:32.490 --> 46:37.794
"and beg for mercy,
that's when I'll stop."

46:38.629 --> 46:41.764
And I never did.

46:41.766 --> 46:43.366
Not once.

46:43.368 --> 46:46.602
I took it.

46:46.604 --> 46:48.638
Like a man.

46:48.640 --> 46:51.874
But you weren't a man.

46:51.876 --> 46:57.113
You were just
a kid... A boy.

46:59.016 --> 47:03.352
There's no shame in
saying you've had enough,

47:03.354 --> 47:08.457
In stopping the fight
if you're hurt.

47:08.459 --> 47:09.826
That mongoose man...

47:09.828 --> 47:11.694
If he had stayed down
in the early rounds,

47:11.696 --> 47:13.663
What would they
have said about him?

47:13.665 --> 47:15.464
That he's a loser?

47:15.466 --> 47:18.467
Or that he's human?

47:18.469 --> 47:21.337
(spectators cheering)

47:23.140 --> 47:26.108
Maybe it is a noble sport.

47:26.110 --> 47:28.711
Maybe it's
all about character

47:28.713 --> 47:31.414
In a way
a novice like me
can't understand.

47:31.416 --> 47:33.449
But I will
tell you this...

47:33.451 --> 47:37.119
I don't want my son
to be a boxer.

47:38.255 --> 47:40.122
No.

47:40.124 --> 47:41.824
When he's hurt,

47:41.826 --> 47:46.095
I don't want him
to act like he's not.

47:46.097 --> 47:51.434
That is not a lesson
he needs to learn.

47:52.369 --> 47:58.107
And I don't think
that's what's going to
make him a man.

48:03.080 --> 48:05.448
(monitor beeping)

48:07.117 --> 48:09.619
Nurse. Book.

48:24.835 --> 48:27.003
Retract.

48:38.382 --> 48:38.748
Stent.

48:38.750 --> 48:42.551
Virginia: What did daddy
make you for dinner?

48:42.553 --> 48:44.820
But, tessy, you like corn.

48:44.822 --> 48:46.889
Well, if you were worried
about your tooth,

48:46.891 --> 48:49.659
You should have asked him
to cut it off the cob.

48:49.661 --> 48:51.093
You in your jams?

48:51.095 --> 48:55.231
Is daddy going to
read you a story?

48:55.399 --> 48:58.801
Well, ask him
to make one up, then.

48:58.803 --> 49:01.170
All right, well, then,
you make one up

49:01.172 --> 49:03.439
And you tell him.

49:03.441 --> 49:07.109
A princess. Right.

49:07.111 --> 49:08.911
Well...

49:08.913 --> 49:09.612
Well, couldn't...

49:09.614 --> 49:12.648
Couldn't she go
on an adventure
all on her own

49:12.650 --> 49:15.051
Without a prince?

49:16.420 --> 49:18.988
All right, well...

49:18.990 --> 49:22.658
Well, then,
maybe she could
rescue him.

49:22.660 --> 49:24.493
It does too happen.

49:24.495 --> 49:26.929
Tessa, you're right.

49:26.931 --> 49:27.496
You're right.

49:27.498 --> 49:30.599
No, no, no,
you tell whatever
story you want.

49:30.601 --> 49:31.367
(knocking on door)

49:31.369 --> 49:33.569
All right, goose.
I love you, too.

49:33.571 --> 49:35.838
All right.
Sleep tight.

49:35.840 --> 49:38.140
And tell henry
I love him.

49:38.142 --> 49:40.710
(spectators cheering)

49:42.512 --> 49:46.248
(announcer speaking
indistinctly)

49:49.486 --> 49:51.587
Uh, it's right over there.

49:51.589 --> 49:52.688
I've got it.

49:52.690 --> 49:56.659
Was everything to
your satisfaction,
mrs. Holden?

49:56.661 --> 49:58.594
Yes, absolutely...

49:58.596 --> 49:59.462
Elliot.
Elliot.

49:59.464 --> 50:01.497
I brought you that
umbrella last week.

50:01.499 --> 50:03.733
Right.
Let me find my purse.

50:03.735 --> 50:06.235
Oh, that won't
be necessary.

50:06.237 --> 50:08.437
Dr. Holden saw to it.

50:09.840 --> 50:11.741
Announcer:  <i>Up at</i>
<i>the count of three...</i>

50:11.743 --> 50:13.376
You know, ma'am,
if you'd like to put in

50:13.378 --> 50:16.812
A standing order for
anything for next time...

50:16.814 --> 50:17.380
Excuse me?

50:17.382 --> 50:19.548
So we can have it
waiting for you.

50:19.550 --> 50:22.918
If you prefer foam pillows
to down, for example,

50:22.920 --> 50:23.819
Extra bath towels.

50:23.821 --> 50:26.522
Ah. Well,
towels would be nice.

50:26.524 --> 50:28.924
Here you go.

50:28.926 --> 50:29.892
Thank you.

50:29.894 --> 50:31.127
I'll let housekeeping know.

50:31.129 --> 50:32.628
Some of our
regulars request

50:32.630 --> 50:36.399
We have flowers
or champagne
waiting for them.

50:36.401 --> 50:38.667
(chuckles)
that's all right.

50:38.669 --> 50:41.604
We don't need
any of that fuss.

50:41.606 --> 50:43.806
Well, women say that,

50:43.808 --> 50:46.842
But they appreciate
a nice gesture.

50:46.844 --> 50:47.777
So says my girlfriend.

50:47.779 --> 50:51.647
She's a big fan
of trinkets hidden
in glove compartments

50:51.649 --> 50:53.182
And under sofa cushions.

50:53.184 --> 50:57.219
Yes, well, when you've
been married a while,

50:57.221 --> 51:01.490
Jewelry doesn't make
as many appearances.

51:07.230 --> 51:09.999
Perhaps you need
to drop a few hints...

51:10.001 --> 51:13.169
Give dr. Holden
some direction.

51:13.703 --> 51:17.840
Actually, he does
other things for me.

51:17.842 --> 51:21.177
He takes me seriously.

51:21.179 --> 51:23.112
Listens to me.

51:23.114 --> 51:26.115
And in a few years,
those will be the things

51:26.117 --> 51:28.951
That your
girlfriend appreciates.

51:28.953 --> 51:32.388
You remember that,
now, elliot.

51:32.390 --> 51:33.823
Will do.

51:33.825 --> 51:36.459
Have a good night, ma'am.

51:39.463 --> 51:41.363
(door closes)

51:43.033 --> 51:44.333
What'd I miss?

51:44.335 --> 51:47.636
(announcer speaking
indistinctly)

51:47.638 --> 51:50.739
(spectators cheering)

51:50.741 --> 51:53.642
It almost looks
like love, doesn't it?

51:53.644 --> 51:57.646
The way they reach for
each other and hold on.

51:57.648 --> 51:59.782
It's two of them
against each other, sure,

51:59.784 --> 52:03.786
But it's also them
against that crowd.

52:03.788 --> 52:06.755
Listen to them scream.

52:20.804 --> 52:23.739
Announcer:  <i>One minute</i>
<i>to go in round 8.</i>

52:24.941 --> 52:28.544
I did a good job.
Can't even tell.

52:28.546 --> 52:29.345
There.

52:29.347 --> 52:31.881
Do you get
many compliments?

52:31.883 --> 52:32.815
On?

52:32.817 --> 52:35.050
Your anniversary present.

52:35.052 --> 52:37.853
I had to
look up what you
get for your 14th.

52:37.855 --> 52:40.322
No two stores
said the same thing,

52:40.324 --> 52:43.826
So I decided on...

52:47.164 --> 52:49.932
Bakelite.

52:49.934 --> 52:53.502
I'll do better next year.

52:53.504 --> 52:56.372
It's a big one.

52:58.208 --> 53:01.911
We should go,
don't you think?

53:03.446 --> 53:06.382
You have a long drive.

53:06.384 --> 53:07.883
Promise me you'll, uh,

53:07.885 --> 53:11.053
Pull over at a rest stop
if you get tired.

53:11.055 --> 53:14.823
Windows up,
doors locked.

53:17.694 --> 53:21.497
How you worry,
dr. Holden.

53:24.668 --> 53:28.904
This is where
a married couple
would kiss.

53:33.009 --> 53:34.743
Don't forget your watch.

53:34.745 --> 53:38.581
It's there,
by your wedding band.

53:57.367 --> 54:00.069
You go on ahead.
I'll write it up.

54:05.442 --> 54:07.676
What will you say?

54:07.678 --> 54:09.812
(sighs)

54:09.814 --> 54:13.816
Two acts of intercourse,
mutually satisfying,

54:13.818 --> 54:15.918
One masturbatory act,

54:15.920 --> 54:18.921
Role-playing throughout.

54:20.390 --> 54:22.858
Am I forgetting anything?

54:31.268 --> 54:33.035
(door opens)

54:33.037 --> 54:36.805
(baby crying)
shh.

54:42.912 --> 54:44.913
Third-floor nursery, please.

54:44.915 --> 54:49.952
It's dr. Masters,
checking on the
bombeck baby.

54:49.954 --> 54:50.586
Yes, this morning.

54:50.588 --> 54:53.455
I left instructions to
measure his ins and outs.

54:53.457 --> 54:56.392
Has he taken
a bottle yet?

54:57.460 --> 55:00.095
No. You're mistaken.

55:01.798 --> 55:04.066
When?

55:04.068 --> 55:05.668
Waiting room.

55:05.670 --> 55:07.903
Okay.

55:13.943 --> 55:15.844
What's going on?

55:18.748 --> 55:20.716
What the hell
are you doing?

55:20.718 --> 55:21.183
I told you.

55:21.185 --> 55:23.352
I said I wasn't
leaving here with an "it."

55:23.354 --> 55:25.954
Look, you've got
to put a stop to this.

55:25.956 --> 55:26.455
There's time.

55:26.457 --> 55:28.257
The desk said
your son's in pre-op.

55:28.259 --> 55:29.291
He's not my son.
He is.

55:29.293 --> 55:33.228
Look, they're gonna
fix him, but it can't
happen this fast.

55:33.230 --> 55:34.830
It's not...
Not overnight.

55:34.832 --> 55:38.901
You want the
very best person.

55:38.903 --> 55:39.935
We found somebody.

55:39.937 --> 55:42.404
Uh, dr. Bracken? Brigham?

55:42.406 --> 55:43.639
Said he could do it.

55:43.641 --> 55:47.042
Hugh britton?
But he's a general surgeon.

55:47.044 --> 55:48.243
Well, he said,
uh, he said

55:48.245 --> 55:50.379
It's a lot less complicated
than you made it seem.

55:50.381 --> 55:53.816
He said a hole
is easier than a pole.

55:53.818 --> 55:54.783
No!

55:54.785 --> 55:55.818
You c...

55:55.820 --> 55:58.387
(breathing shakily)

56:01.891 --> 56:03.759
Look, please.

56:05.028 --> 56:07.696
Go in there and stop it.

56:07.698 --> 56:09.565
This needs more thought.

56:09.567 --> 56:11.133
Just give it a week.

56:11.135 --> 56:13.869
All right, even...
Even just another day.

56:13.871 --> 56:15.871
Just think it...
Think it through.

56:15.873 --> 56:18.240
This is irrevocable.

56:18.242 --> 56:20.909
You have a son.

56:22.178 --> 56:23.312
Look, I...

56:23.314 --> 56:26.815
I'm...
I'm begging you.

56:28.718 --> 56:31.053
Let him be what he is.

56:31.055 --> 56:33.422
A boy.

56:35.358 --> 56:36.658
It's done.

56:36.660 --> 56:38.060
The doctor's finishing.

56:38.062 --> 56:44.233
The nurse came out
and told me the operation
was a success.

56:44.901 --> 56:47.870
We're naming her sarah.

56:49.406 --> 56:51.974
Better a tomboy
than a sissy.

57:13.496 --> 57:15.631
(people cheering)

57:15.633 --> 57:18.967
