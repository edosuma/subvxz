WEBVTT

00:17.559 --> 00:18.892
ANNOUNCER: Evil plans!

00:19.310 --> 00:21.687
With the Jedi Council
focused on the war effort,

00:22.063 --> 00:25.816
criminal minds are left unchecked
to spread fear and corruption.

00:26.317 --> 00:29.820
Galactic gangster Jabba the Hutt
has sent bounty hunter Cad Bane

00:29.904 --> 00:34.158
on a nefarious mission which shall strike
at the heart of the Republic.

00:35.243 --> 00:40.080
Meanwhile, the unsuspecting citizens
of Coruscant go about their daily lives.

00:40.540 --> 00:41.623
Wait, no.

00:41.833 --> 00:44.793
The tendrils belong on the main table
between Anakin and Senator Aang.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.171
-Mistress.
-Not that one.

00:47.255 --> 00:49.840
The red one,
Senator Aang's favorite color is red.

00:49.924 --> 00:51.050
Very well.

00:51.217 --> 00:55.054
You need to take a breath.
This party will work out.

00:55.180 --> 00:56.180
(SIGHS)

00:56.347 --> 00:57.598
It has to.

00:57.682 --> 01:00.976
Senator Aang holds the deciding vote
on the Military Oversight Committee.

01:01.102 --> 01:05.647
You know how particular the Roonan are.
I need everything to be perfect.

01:05.732 --> 01:06.732
(CHUCKLES)

01:06.858 --> 01:08.484
You have nothing to worry about.

01:08.610 --> 01:09.651
(CLATTERING)

01:09.694 --> 01:10.736
Perfect!

01:10.820 --> 01:13.030
For the most important
state banquet of the season,

01:13.114 --> 01:15.949
they send us waiter droids
with malfunctioning digits.

01:17.744 --> 01:18.827
It will be okay.

01:19.370 --> 01:22.998
Those are much too large.
Have you seen the size of Roonan teeth?

01:23.291 --> 01:24.750
Tiny. Tiny!

01:24.834 --> 01:25.959
-Right away.
-Sir?

01:26.669 --> 01:28.003
That won't do at all.

01:28.171 --> 01:32.591
This is a social gathering
for the communal taking of sustenance.

01:32.759 --> 01:36.512
Your effort evokes the terror of younglings
fleeing a flesh-eating monster.

01:37.639 --> 01:38.806
Okay, then.

01:39.057 --> 01:41.642
Oh, my! The garnish!

01:41.726 --> 01:46.688
Artoo! I ask you to oversee one thing
and you allow this?

01:48.733 --> 01:50.776
Threepio, is there a problem?

01:50.985 --> 01:56.281
I am sorry, my lady, but it appears
the dessert is missing its jogan fruit.

01:56.616 --> 01:57.783
So go get one.

01:58.368 --> 01:59.910
I could not possibly leave now.

01:59.994 --> 02:02.412
-Threepio...
-Fine, send Artoo, then.

02:02.664 --> 02:06.166
I'm afraid that may not be
the most appropriate idea.

02:06.292 --> 02:09.670
It was R2-D2 who put us
in this predicament,

02:09.754 --> 02:11.463
quite inadvertently, I'm sure.

02:11.548 --> 02:12.548
(MURMURING)

02:12.882 --> 02:14.258
Please handle this.

02:14.801 --> 02:15.843
Um...

02:15.885 --> 02:18.846
Okay. Threepio, look,
I'm sending you on a mission.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.681
A mission? Oh, my!

02:20.849 --> 02:24.101
Yes, and Artoo is going along with you.

02:24.352 --> 02:25.477
Oh, my.

02:25.895 --> 02:29.565
This should be more than enough credits
if you don't get swindled.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.191
Swindled? Me?

02:31.317 --> 02:32.317
(BEEPING)

02:32.485 --> 02:34.820
Yes, you. Go there, come back.

02:34.904 --> 02:37.072
Don't get lost, and don't get distracted.

02:37.699 --> 02:40.576
Of course, Master Anakin.
Come along, Artoo.

02:50.545 --> 02:56.216
Lost! Distracted! I cannot imagine
where Master Anakin gets these ideas.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.343
You are the one who gets distracted.

02:58.428 --> 02:59.428
(BEEPING)

03:00.305 --> 03:04.141
You most certainly do.
You wander off like a drunken nuna.

03:04.225 --> 03:08.395
I have half a mind to recalibrate
your focusing capacitors.

03:08.521 --> 03:09.771
(BEEPING ANGRILY)

03:12.942 --> 03:17.196
There they are. The gold one is the target.

03:17.655 --> 03:19.740
Now, get down there and do your job.

03:19.824 --> 03:21.074
At your service, Mr. Bane.

03:26.331 --> 03:29.708
Here we are. Now, listen and learn.

03:30.251 --> 03:34.171
Excuse me, fine sir,
but do you by any chance have jogan fruit?

03:37.550 --> 03:42.137
Do I have jogan?
Can a Jedi use the Force?

03:42.347 --> 03:46.516
I shall take that as a yes.
How much would four cost?

03:47.143 --> 03:48.727
How much you got, my friend?

03:49.187 --> 03:52.564
Artoo, make sure you watch our credits.

03:52.690 --> 03:53.690
(BEEPING)

03:54.192 --> 03:58.237
My grandpa always told me, "Don't
watch your credits, watch your health."

03:58.696 --> 04:00.197
So while I was watching my health,

04:00.406 --> 04:02.491
someone stole my credits.

04:02.575 --> 04:03.575
(LAUGHING)

04:04.202 --> 04:05.244
My grandpa!

04:06.829 --> 04:11.541
A cautionary tale, indeed.
Might I please purchase four jogan?

04:12.377 --> 04:16.505
Your lucky day.
Only ones left on the planet. Four credits.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.966
Four, that seems fair.

04:19.342 --> 04:20.384
Each.

04:20.593 --> 04:21.593
(EXCLAIMING)

04:22.011 --> 04:24.763
I don't need you to tell me
what galactic robbery is!

04:25.056 --> 04:27.224
But what choice do we have?

04:27.392 --> 04:28.392
(BEEPING)

04:28.977 --> 04:31.186
Very well, we will take them.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.312
(R2-D2 BEEPING)

04:32.563 --> 04:36.608
-Sixteen credits.
-I meant, 32!

04:36.693 --> 04:40.696
You said four each! Four times four is 16!

04:40.989 --> 04:45.701
Thirty-two's the best deal we got today.
Hard times.

04:45.827 --> 04:48.996
Very well, 32, but not one credit more!

04:52.583 --> 04:54.668
You drive a hard bargain.

04:58.923 --> 05:00.048
They're leaving.

05:00.508 --> 05:02.551
Todo, move into position.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.014
I have them marked.

05:10.184 --> 05:11.435
(R2-D2 BEEPING)

05:11.519 --> 05:13.353
As if you could have done any better.

05:13.896 --> 05:16.148
Anyway, we still have eight credits left.

05:16.357 --> 05:19.860
Which is all you need
to revitalize the you inside.

05:20.570 --> 05:23.155
Excuse me, but were you speaking to us?

05:23.239 --> 05:25.866
No, I'm talking to the you you used to be,

05:26.034 --> 05:28.410
that droid fresh off the assembly line.

05:28.536 --> 05:31.872
Once so nimble before joints squeaked
and wiring frayed.

05:32.206 --> 05:33.874
You remember that sparkling fellow?

05:33.916 --> 05:37.544
I am afraid that was a long time ago,
and my friend and I...

05:37.587 --> 05:39.379
Could use a makeover, could you?

05:39.881 --> 05:43.925
Well... No.
No, our master was most insistent

05:44.052 --> 05:48.764
that we shouldn't deviate from our task,
so this is no time for self-indulgence.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.849
-Come along, Artoo.
-(BEEPING)

05:50.933 --> 05:52.517
I said, come along, Artoo!

05:52.935 --> 05:53.935
(EXCLAIMING)

05:54.896 --> 05:56.938
He's right. You should hear me out.

05:57.106 --> 05:59.191
We have no time for this, Artoo.

05:59.275 --> 06:02.361
But a trip to a maintenance bar
would take no time at all.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.863
A maintenance bar for droids?

06:04.947 --> 06:08.700
After all, why should organics be
the only ones who get pampered?

06:08.868 --> 06:11.411
They should not.
That is why right across the street

06:11.454 --> 06:14.790
there is an oasis of pleasure
designed to put you back in touch

06:14.916 --> 06:17.292
with the original assembly-line you.

06:17.543 --> 06:18.543
(BEEPING EXCITEDLY)

06:19.295 --> 06:21.630
R2-D2, where are you going?

06:22.048 --> 06:24.424
We must get back
to the banquet preparation.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.095
As head of protocol, it is vital...

06:28.137 --> 06:29.137
Oh...

06:33.476 --> 06:35.477
(SCREAMING)

06:42.318 --> 06:43.819
(BEEPING EXCITEDLY)

06:44.237 --> 06:46.988
Hello and welcome to Droid Spa.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.992
No need for an appointment.
Right this way.

06:54.205 --> 06:56.665
Please, come inside.

06:57.458 --> 06:59.251
Enjoy yourself.

07:08.344 --> 07:09.469
Oh...

07:10.054 --> 07:11.221
The indignity!

07:13.182 --> 07:16.518
Pardon me, sir, but there appears
to have been a terrible mistake.

07:16.769 --> 07:17.894
I don't think so.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.939
Oh, no, I'm quite right.

07:21.023 --> 07:22.023
(SCREAMING)

07:29.866 --> 07:30.866
(WHISTLING)

07:47.508 --> 07:48.508
(BEEPING HAPPILY)

08:03.691 --> 08:06.026
Why are you putting that there?

08:06.194 --> 08:08.778
To find out what's inside.

08:08.905 --> 08:13.158
Inside?
Just the usual capacitors, nothing special.

08:14.202 --> 08:17.746
It doesn't get more soothing than that,
does it?

08:18.331 --> 08:19.331
(BEEPING)

08:37.058 --> 08:38.266
Oh, my!

08:38.809 --> 08:40.519
(EXCLAIMING)

08:48.861 --> 08:52.364
Just sit back, we'll take care of you.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.993
Ready for your decarbonizing buff?

08:59.539 --> 09:04.292
I don't want this gibberish!
I want the plans for the Senate building!

09:04.335 --> 09:06.628
C-3PO: I don't know
what you're talking about.

09:06.837 --> 09:09.965
You're Senator Amidala's personal droid.

09:10.049 --> 09:13.385
I am a protocol droid.
Human-cyborg relations.

09:13.469 --> 09:16.680
I can translate and instruct
on appropriate etiquette,

09:17.181 --> 09:19.182
which in your case, sir,
if you don't mind me saying,

09:19.308 --> 09:20.725
is sorely lacking.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.230
(EXCLAIMING)

09:26.482 --> 09:30.151
That is exactly the sort of behavior
I am talking about.

09:30.319 --> 09:33.822
According to the analyzer, he is not lying.

09:34.407 --> 09:39.035
His head's totally empty of any information
useful to us.

09:39.495 --> 09:44.583
Empty? I protest. I am fluent in over
six million forms of communication.

09:44.667 --> 09:47.377
I have extensive programming
in the correct...

09:47.503 --> 09:52.382
Ain't that great! A brainless droid.
Worthless.

09:52.675 --> 09:55.343
My lack of knowledge
is not an impediment at all.

09:55.511 --> 09:59.014
Floor plans, blueprints
are not in my programming.

09:59.056 --> 10:01.349
That was always Artoo's specialty.

10:01.851 --> 10:08.064
Artoo? The astromech.
Go fetch me his little pal.

10:14.363 --> 10:17.157
Oh, no! What have I done?

10:23.623 --> 10:26.541
(BEEPING)

10:35.092 --> 10:36.092
(MURMURING)

10:47.730 --> 10:49.147
(BEEPING INQUISITIVELY)

10:49.231 --> 10:51.399
I do not know where your buddy is.

10:51.609 --> 10:54.235
How about taking a look at these items?

10:54.278 --> 10:55.779
Top-drawer titanium,

10:55.905 --> 10:58.740
guaranteed to last longer
than your circuit boards.

10:59.492 --> 11:04.079
Hey, if price is the issue,
then I'll knock six credits off.

11:09.418 --> 11:10.960
You're coming with us.

11:11.337 --> 11:12.337
(BEEPING EXCITEDLY)

11:14.173 --> 11:15.965
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?

11:16.133 --> 11:18.802
Hey, what's with the suction thing
on the cart?

11:18.928 --> 11:20.095
Hey, now. No!

11:23.265 --> 11:24.265
Stop him!

12:04.181 --> 12:05.181
(BEEPING)

12:10.563 --> 12:12.397
That's the wrong droid!

12:12.732 --> 12:15.191
Murderer! Murderer!

12:18.821 --> 12:20.321
(BEEPING NERVOUSLY)

12:20.740 --> 12:22.741
(GROANING)

12:26.328 --> 12:29.581
Swindled, me? Might I remind you, sir,

12:29.665 --> 12:32.834
I was once protocol droid
to the chief negotiator

12:32.877 --> 12:35.003
for the entire Manakron system.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.547
Wait a minute, you're not Master Ani.

12:38.007 --> 12:41.843
No. I'm your worst nightmare, pal.

12:42.094 --> 12:45.388
You certainly are.
It's all coming back to me now.

12:46.182 --> 12:50.518
Thanks to you, the only thing coming back
is your little friend.

12:51.520 --> 12:52.687
Oh, no!

12:52.772 --> 12:53.980
(SCREAMING)

12:54.231 --> 12:56.441
This is a nightmare!

12:59.028 --> 13:00.236
He is not here.

13:04.450 --> 13:08.620
Bane will not be pleased
if we come back empty-handed.

13:09.914 --> 13:13.208
If the gold one cannot provide
the information in his current state,

13:13.292 --> 13:17.670
then I shall personally dismantle
every circuit in his plated little body

13:17.755 --> 13:18.797
to get those answers!

13:20.633 --> 13:22.884
That will destroy him.

13:36.357 --> 13:37.774
(BEEPING EXCITEDLY)

13:38.567 --> 13:42.153
Noble, yes. Wise? I think not.

Connections complete.
Ready for download.

14:17.106 --> 14:21.860
Your friend Goldenrod
turned out to be a huge waste of my time.

14:22.236 --> 14:25.029
Something my clients don't have a lot of.

14:26.699 --> 14:30.702
You know what's good for you,
you'll give me what I want.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.996

14:47.720 --> 14:49.762
Download that data
onto the memory drive.

14:49.847 --> 14:51.806
I will deliver it immediately.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.558
And prepare my ship.

14:53.642 --> 14:56.352
What should we do with these two?

14:56.437 --> 14:59.647
Wipe their memory
and dump them back in the street.

14:59.982 --> 15:02.108
They'll find their way back home.

15:02.693 --> 15:06.613
We can't have
anything looking out of place, can we?

15:16.999 --> 15:19.000
It's so good to see you, Senator Aang.

15:19.084 --> 15:22.170
How good it is to see you,
Senator Amidala.

15:24.340 --> 15:25.965
Where can Threepio be?

15:26.342 --> 15:28.301
I have no idea.

I've been looking all over for you.

16:12.388 --> 16:15.765
I'm certain we're late.
We'll be deactivated for sure.

As you requested,
the floor plans of the Senate.

16:44.962 --> 16:47.463
I'll be needing my full payment now.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.177
(LAUGHING)

16:54.513 --> 16:56.180
Something funny?

16:56.640 --> 16:58.850
(SPEAKING HUTTESE)

16:59.852 --> 17:04.147
The almighty Jabba
requires further assistance.

17:04.648 --> 17:08.359
You saying there's still more moves
to this dance?

17:08.694 --> 17:10.945
(SPEAKING HUTTESE)

17:11.864 --> 17:13.614
Name your price.

17:14.199 --> 17:18.202
I suppose I could rearrange
my busy schedule.

17:18.287 --> 17:19.871
But I'll need details.

17:21.081 --> 17:25.084
And an advance on my services
while we negotiate new terms.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.211
(LAUGHING)

17:28.005 --> 17:30.173
(SPEAKING HUTTESE)

17:31.300 --> 17:32.967
And the advance?

17:33.302 --> 17:34.969
(SPEAKING HUTTESE)

17:37.514 --> 17:41.893
First, the great Jabba
must receive the Council's approval.

17:42.436 --> 17:44.979
The new assignment must be serious.

17:45.314 --> 17:46.731
(SPEAKING HUTTESE)

17:50.152 --> 17:53.988
Jabba wants everyone out
except you, Cad Bane.

18:10.422 --> 18:15.802
Well, well. If it isn't the heads
of the five Hutt families.

18:16.178 --> 18:19.764
Droid, my ancient Huttese is a little rusty.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.349
Tell me what they say.

18:21.683 --> 18:23.601
(COUNCIL SPEAKING ANCIENT HUTTESE)

18:32.194 --> 18:37.615
Jabba and Arok are debating
how important Ziro's release is.

18:38.075 --> 18:40.076
(SPEAKING ANCIENT HUTTESE)

18:42.371 --> 18:47.834
Apparently, Ziro holds in his possession
some dangerous information.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.711
Dangerous to the Hutt Council.

18:52.881 --> 18:54.715
(SPEAKING ANCIENT HUTTESE)

19:08.730 --> 19:14.318
Oruba feels the Council will be safer
with Ziro under their protection.

19:14.570 --> 19:17.655
(SPEAKING ANCIENT HUTTESE)

19:21.243 --> 19:26.247
They want to know who shall take on
this very dangerous task.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.583
That would be me.

19:29.418 --> 19:31.377
Cad Bane, at your service.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.754
I'll take on any job

19:35.215 --> 19:37.216
for the right price.

19:46.059 --> 19:47.602
What are we going to do?

19:47.895 --> 19:51.439
Artoo and C-3PO have not returned
with the jogan fruit for the cake.

19:52.733 --> 19:56.027
I knew this was going to happen,
that's why I sent Artoo.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.405
To the signing of the treaty.

19:59.448 --> 20:03.701
And to my favorite dessert,
jogan fruitcake, yes.

20:08.874 --> 20:12.126
Oh, no.
I'm never going to hear the end of this one.

20:12.294 --> 20:13.294
(R2-D2 BEEPING)

20:14.254 --> 20:17.298
Threepio, where were you?
You almost missed the whole party!

20:17.633 --> 20:19.634
We encountered some complications, sir.

20:19.927 --> 20:22.261
What kind of complications?

20:22.554 --> 20:27.975
Actually, I have no recollection of my day.
I cannot really explain where I have been.

20:28.727 --> 20:29.810
Thank you.

20:32.648 --> 20:36.901
One, two, three, four.

20:42.115 --> 20:43.783
You're going to have to do
better than that, Threepio,

20:43.825 --> 20:46.244
because if Padmé's dinner is a disaster,

20:46.328 --> 20:48.120
then you're not the only one
she's going to be mad at.

20:48.163 --> 20:51.332
Anakin, stop worrying.
The cake is right here.

20:53.502 --> 20:55.294
You should really lighten up on these two.

20:55.504 --> 20:56.504
(BEEPING)

20:56.922 --> 20:59.173
Threepio, you've done a magnificent job.

20:59.841 --> 21:03.344
Oh, my. A magnificent job?

21:04.096 --> 21:09.809
A magnificent job! A magnificent job.
A magnificent job.

21:10.519 --> 21:11.686
A magnificent job.

21:11.812 --> 21:13.688
Well, we're gonna hear about this
one for a while, buddy.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.189
-A magnificent job!
-(BEEPING AFFIRMATIVELY)

21:15.774 --> 21:19.360
A magnificent job. A magnificent job!

21:19.695 --> 21:21.028
A magnificent job.
