00:12.360 --> 00:14.015
Do you think people could change?

00:14.742 --> 00:16.729
I'm talking at the most
basic level.

00:16.779 --> 00:19.835
Do you think a truly bad person
can become good?

00:19.871 --> 00:21.381
And vice versa?

03:34.793 --> 03:37.126
Experiencing the hottest
September on record.

03:37.170 --> 03:39.948
And authorities are reminding us all
to conserve energy...

03:40.068 --> 03:41.729
...so turn down those thermostats...

03:41.757 --> 03:44.192
...and try not to blast
that Air Conditioning.

03:44.227 --> 03:46.442
Now, we go to St Bernard Parish.

03:46.485 --> 03:49.664
Where a triple homicide has
police searching for answers...

03:49.692 --> 03:52.264
...and a neighborhood searching
for its soul.

04:12.622 --> 04:14.096
It's unexpected.

04:15.844 --> 04:17.132
Is it really?

05:19.790 --> 05:21.564
I've got a question to ask you.

05:24.069 --> 05:25.045
Yeah?

05:25.352 --> 05:26.990
I think we've been dating long enough...

05:27.026 --> 05:29.190
...that I can ask you this question.

05:32.111 --> 05:35.189
Why the fuck don't you have
anything on your walls?

05:38.001 --> 05:39.475
- What?
- Like...

05:39.568 --> 05:41.662
...posters, paintings...

05:41.782 --> 05:43.322
...family pictures?

05:43.614 --> 05:46.877
A picture of a kitten hanging on a branch
saying "hang in there".

05:48.423 --> 05:50.703
I've never been big
on decorating.

05:51.479 --> 05:52.740
Well...

05:53.723 --> 05:55.361
I could buy you something.

05:57.451 --> 05:58.819
Tell me what you like.

05:58.939 --> 06:01.198
I don't know,
you choose.

06:01.623 --> 06:02.620
Okay.

06:02.997 --> 06:04.785
Wrong answer.

06:04.905 --> 06:06.986
That is what you always say.

06:07.022 --> 06:08.161
I do?

06:08.281 --> 06:09.679
Especially in bed.

06:11.983 --> 06:12.965
Really?

06:13.000 --> 06:15.194
Yeah, you're very...

06:16.063 --> 06:19.484
...conventional, when it
comes to having sex.

06:19.534 --> 06:21.264
It kept you coming back here.

06:21.592 --> 06:23.423
I'm not saying it's bad.

06:24.569 --> 06:25.795
Baby...

06:25.915 --> 06:27.661
...you're hot.

06:27.882 --> 06:28.993
And...

06:29.413 --> 06:31.408
...you got a great cock.

06:33.584 --> 06:34.980
But you know...

06:35.756 --> 06:37.216
we can...

06:37.644 --> 06:40.398
we can try things
that are different.

06:42.721 --> 06:45.606
I guess i'm just a
meat and potatoes kind of guy.

06:46.429 --> 06:48.096
Are you sure about that?

06:50.793 --> 06:53.129
This is why we've never gone serious.

06:53.249 --> 06:54.198
No.

06:54.376 --> 06:56.187
I'm just not that kind of girl.

06:57.483 --> 06:59.938
What about if i put up
some posters?

07:01.997 --> 07:04.384
Why do i want to
mess up a good thing?

09:11.946 --> 09:13.000
Hey!

09:14.925 --> 09:16.193
Hey!

09:16.313 --> 09:17.547
Help me!

09:18.845 --> 09:20.255
Please!

09:39.543 --> 09:41.509
Hey, hey...

09:41.929 --> 09:43.461
Hey sweetheart...

09:43.819 --> 09:45.579
...it was just a bad dream.

09:46.391 --> 09:47.623
Come to bed.

10:05.582 --> 10:06.551
This is it?

10:20.815 --> 10:23.148
Two cobbs and a chicken masala.

10:23.454 --> 10:24.935
Is the fish done yet?

10:25.228 --> 10:26.844
Give me a second please.

10:26.872 --> 10:30.014
Alright, you know i don't like it
when they whine.

10:30.134 --> 10:31.906
Almost done, okay?

10:32.362 --> 10:34.278
Dylan, you look like shit, man.
Are you alright?

10:34.321 --> 10:36.463
I had a bad dream...
It's the cod...

10:36.498 --> 10:38.165
You're dreaming til you're dead?

10:38.201 --> 10:40.241
You look like that shit.

10:40.291 --> 10:42.784
- Coming through, sorry.
- Fuck!

10:56.953 --> 10:58.945
This seriously might get infected.

11:00.790 --> 11:02.457
You need to see a doctor.

11:02.486 --> 11:03.953
I don't like doctors.

11:04.273 --> 11:05.658
Well...

11:05.993 --> 11:07.439
...have fun losing your arm.

11:07.559 --> 11:08.799
Thanks, mom.

11:10.396 --> 11:11.173
Hey...

11:11.586 --> 11:12.797
...thank you.

11:15.704 --> 11:16.631
Hello?

11:18.005 --> 11:19.087
Hey.

11:20.776 --> 11:23.624
I'd love to,
i've got company.

11:23.646 --> 11:24.686
Who is it?

11:24.721 --> 11:25.790
One sec.

11:25.840 --> 11:28.060
It's my buddy Johnny.

11:28.124 --> 11:30.233
He's getting a bunch of people
gather for the Saint's game.

11:30.269 --> 11:31.942
- Oh my God, let's do it.
- No.

11:31.970 --> 11:33.053
Yes!

11:33.794 --> 11:34.813
Really?

11:34.884 --> 11:37.839
All we ever do is hang around your
apartement, watch TV and fuck.

11:37.867 --> 11:39.692
Shh, it's my sous chef.

11:39.927 --> 11:42.178
It'll be good for you
to see the outside world.

11:47.906 --> 11:50.285
Okay, we'll be right over.

11:50.364 --> 11:51.646
Do you need anything?

12:01.976 --> 12:03.280
What do you want to pick up?

12:04.612 --> 12:06.600
Maybe grab the chips,
i'll get the beer.

12:20.944 --> 12:22.929
- What?
- Hey...

12:23.049 --> 12:24.083
No.

12:24.203 --> 12:25.209
No.

12:25.287 --> 12:26.966
They're good.

12:27.350 --> 12:28.369
We're getting them.

12:46.906 --> 12:48.758
You want American
or imported?

12:50.880 --> 12:52.070
American.

13:15.471 --> 13:16.475
Dylan?

13:16.610 --> 13:17.629
Dylan!

13:17.749 --> 13:18.988
What the fuck's going on?

13:19.030 --> 13:20.462
Where did you go?

13:20.844 --> 13:22.704
You're okay, look at me.

13:22.753 --> 13:23.993
You're okay.

13:25.824 --> 13:28.224
I don't understand,
so this has happened before then?

13:28.274 --> 13:31.207
You don't have to tell me that,
i don't understand it anymore than you do.

13:31.400 --> 13:32.974
I'm fucking terrified.

13:33.024 --> 13:35.130
I feel like i'm falling apart.

13:38.016 --> 13:39.363
I'm going crazy.

13:45.970 --> 13:47.484
I'll call as soon
as i get there, okay?

13:47.512 --> 13:49.015
You can't tell me
where you're going?

13:49.051 --> 13:50.469
I can't say it.

13:52.423 --> 13:54.987
Try, my mouth might
inform the worst.

14:56.778 --> 14:57.790
Well...

14:58.623 --> 14:59.870
...he's in his office.

15:00.213 --> 15:01.224
Okay.

15:01.460 --> 15:02.727
You know the wing?

15:03.488 --> 15:04.300
Yeah.

15:05.632 --> 15:07.447
Nice to...

16:36.569 --> 16:39.081
The prodigal son returns, i suppose.

16:45.735 --> 16:46.752
Well...

16:48.737 --> 16:50.344
I don't know where to start.

16:52.014 --> 16:53.159
I'm sorry.

16:55.500 --> 16:57.520
I had to leave.

16:58.160 --> 17:00.600
I already lost over 2 years
to this place.

17:00.977 --> 17:02.862
Consider yourself lucky.

17:02.897 --> 17:05.063
Most of my patients
never wake up, period.

17:05.098 --> 17:07.169
Do not give me
the miracle speech...

17:07.553 --> 17:09.790
I'm not feeling to miraculous
right now.

17:10.103 --> 17:11.404
What's going on?

17:11.523 --> 17:12.678
Why are you here?

17:16.872 --> 17:18.911
I've been having these episodes.

17:19.338 --> 17:21.960
It was in a convinient store.

17:22.337 --> 17:24.805
Next thing i know,
i was coming to a parking lot.

17:25.047 --> 17:27.646
It feels like i go somewhere else entirely.

17:27.695 --> 17:29.623
And the things I see...

17:31.689 --> 17:33.154
...they're really horrible.

17:33.274 --> 17:35.899
Has anything else changed
since you left?

17:35.970 --> 17:37.813
I'm as blank as i ever was...

17:37.862 --> 17:39.834
I have no idea who I am.

17:40.062 --> 17:42.245
Or my life before i woke up here.

17:42.452 --> 17:45.008
Sounds to me like
your memories are coming back.

17:45.065 --> 17:47.519
Interrupting your current state
of be-attitude.

17:48.746 --> 17:53.053
I don't think they can be memories,
they're far too strange, they follow some...

17:53.792 --> 17:55.492
...twisted nightmare logic.

17:56.693 --> 17:58.599
I don't know what be-attitude means.

17:58.848 --> 18:00.356
It's a state of grace.

18:00.546 --> 18:03.939
Some people regard amnesia
as the ultimate blessing.

18:04.010 --> 18:05.459
A blank slate.

18:05.579 --> 18:07.444
A change to start anew.

18:08.134 --> 18:11.485
Why would anybody want to forget
what their life was like?

18:11.763 --> 18:14.052
Someone who didn't have
a good one.

18:20.585 --> 18:21.865
Can i ask you a question?

18:22.634 --> 18:23.736
Go ahead.

18:24.810 --> 18:26.297
Do you think I'm dead?

18:26.937 --> 18:28.793
You think this is a dream...

18:29.405 --> 18:31.599
I don't know where you're getting at
but as your doctor...

18:31.635 --> 18:33.548
I can assure you of two things.

18:33.897 --> 18:37.735
One, people in a persistent
vegetative state...

18:37.785 --> 18:39.856
...don't dream.
And two...

18:40.290 --> 18:43.363
...you are most certainly alive.

18:47.708 --> 18:49.333
What does this all gonna do?

18:51.083 --> 18:55.115
The MRI confirmed that there's no
structural damage.

18:56.438 --> 18:58.186
These give me...

18:58.875 --> 19:00.277
...a peak...

19:00.319 --> 19:02.195
...of your brain in action.

19:02.970 --> 19:04.862
If you have an episode...

19:05.145 --> 19:07.315
...it's gonna tell me
what's going on.

19:13.875 --> 19:15.247
Try to relax.

19:18.106 --> 19:19.180
I'll try.

21:34.802 --> 21:36.054
You were sleepwalking.

21:36.132 --> 21:38.440
I wasn't dreaming,
it was real.

21:38.475 --> 21:39.763
I could hear it.

21:40.124 --> 21:42.044
I could smell it,
and I could taste it.

21:42.080 --> 21:44.953
You were in the deepest stages
of REM when this occured.

21:49.578 --> 21:50.894
I can't stay here.

21:52.060 --> 21:53.412
Explain to me why not.

21:55.840 --> 21:58.584
I came here terrified
there was a tumor in my head.

21:58.620 --> 22:02.715
But you know what, there is not a medical
explanation for what happened to me...

22:04.259 --> 22:06.172
I disappeared from this room.

22:07.543 --> 22:09.229
I came back in the hallway.

22:10.232 --> 22:11.892
In between, I went somewhere else.

22:11.928 --> 22:12.796
No.

22:12.838 --> 22:15.288
It sounds like neurogical malfunctioning.

22:15.337 --> 22:18.545
It sounds to me, your doctor,
we need to continue testing you.

22:18.602 --> 22:20.457
Oh yeah? Run a million tests...

22:20.564 --> 22:23.096
...hook me up to an IV,
stick probes up my ass...

22:23.216 --> 22:24.745
...you're not gonna find anything.

22:27.611 --> 22:30.569
My memory goes back
just under 3 years.

22:30.689 --> 22:32.006
I don't know
who i am.

22:32.040 --> 22:35.326
I know my time tables,
I know how to go to the store...

22:35.361 --> 22:37.649
...but anything personal,
it's gone.

22:37.769 --> 22:40.402
Dylan White isn't even
your real name, is it?

22:40.473 --> 22:42.586
Dylan White is a deep coma patient.

22:42.629 --> 22:45.031
I stole his driving license,
social security card...

22:45.066 --> 22:46.617
...so i could get a start.

22:46.910 --> 22:49.080
Wasn't there an accident near
where they found you?

22:49.129 --> 22:51.161
No, just me lying here with this...

22:51.204 --> 22:53.825
...cerebral hematoma
and fractured collar bone.

22:53.882 --> 22:55.831
I was never supposed to be found.

23:00.197 --> 23:01.557
Dylan...

23:01.607 --> 23:03.414
They ran your fingerprints, right?

23:03.705 --> 23:04.413
Nothing.

23:04.470 --> 23:06.689
That means you've never been arrested.

23:06.902 --> 23:09.523
You've never been arrested,
you don't have a criminal record.

23:24.782 --> 23:26.141
Wait a second.

23:27.791 --> 23:30.210
- Sir, can I borrow your paper
for a second? Thank you. - Sure.

23:31.006 --> 23:32.045
What is it?

23:35.986 --> 23:37.665
I've seen this number before.

23:38.094 --> 23:39.680
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

23:42.252 --> 23:44.144
It's in New Orleans port area.

23:47.679 --> 23:49.165
Hey, wait a minute.

23:49.215 --> 23:51.940
Dylan, you want to drive
an hour or so to...

23:51.983 --> 23:53.467
...some house...

23:53.517 --> 23:55.393
...because you think you've seen
this number in a dream?

23:55.442 --> 23:57.218
- It's more like a shitty motel.
- That's not my point.

23:57.253 --> 23:58.470
I know, I know.

23:58.505 --> 23:59.747
Doesn't this strike you as weird?

23:59.776 --> 24:01.910
Everything is striking me as weird.

24:02.030 --> 24:03.639
Right now, okay?

24:04.272 --> 24:05.445
Okay.

24:05.481 --> 24:07.515
I have Wednesday off,
we can leave in the morning.

24:07.557 --> 24:10.139
It feels like something
i have to do alone.

24:14.742 --> 24:16.000
Okay.

25:29.567 --> 25:31.992
Well, well.
Haven't seen you for a while.

25:32.234 --> 25:33.386
You want the usual?

25:33.760 --> 25:35.118
Yeah, sure.

25:35.645 --> 25:37.094
Alright, 101 it is.

25:37.151 --> 25:38.801
Just sign right there.

25:44.866 --> 25:46.075
How much is it?

25:46.195 --> 25:48.259
- $20.
- Sure.

25:54.301 --> 25:55.275
Thank you.

27:59.505 --> 28:00.437
Fuck.

30:19.967 --> 30:22.427
Whiskey and Abita taster, please.

30:31.968 --> 30:33.283
Keep them coming.

30:37.007 --> 30:37.713
You got it.

31:07.887 --> 31:09.139
It's a snake.

31:13.657 --> 31:15.072
You want a closer look?

31:41.472 --> 31:42.784
What does it mean?

31:44.370 --> 31:45.473
Nothing.

31:46.903 --> 31:48.134
I like snakes.

31:54.979 --> 31:56.260
I'm trying to please you.

31:56.380 --> 31:57.807
- Oh yeah?
- Uh um.

31:57.927 --> 31:59.194
Funny.

31:59.813 --> 32:01.636
I've been doing the same thing.

32:01.679 --> 32:03.052
Trying to please me?

32:03.537 --> 32:05.690
Trying to please myself.

32:06.979 --> 32:08.574
You're a funny guy.

32:23.380 --> 32:24.969
Do we know each other?

32:26.092 --> 32:28.189
I'd like to think
you don't remember.

32:28.834 --> 32:30.023
No.

32:30.679 --> 32:31.757
No.

32:36.452 --> 32:38.297
I got it.

32:40.275 --> 32:42.534
You used to come in
with Quincy, didn't you?

32:43.668 --> 32:46.780
Cause then i would've seen you
but never met you.

32:47.513 --> 32:49.776
It's not like you're someone
i hang out with.

32:51.888 --> 32:53.944
He's not that bad, is he?

32:54.218 --> 32:56.286
You're a funny funny guy.

32:56.619 --> 32:58.286
Quincy's not that bad?

32:58.406 --> 33:00.009
He's like a...

33:00.265 --> 33:03.987
He's like a soft little bunny rabbit.

33:11.663 --> 33:12.874
So...

33:14.121 --> 33:18.044
I haven't seen you around,
what have you been up to?

33:18.164 --> 33:19.878
This and that,
you know.

33:23.950 --> 33:25.764
Since we never officially met...

33:26.566 --> 33:27.971
Marlena.

33:33.202 --> 33:34.260
Dylan.

33:35.540 --> 33:36.669
Dylan.

33:38.724 --> 33:40.475
Nice to meet you, Dylan.

33:45.415 --> 33:47.531
Another round here for me and my friend.

33:55.907 --> 33:56.867
Chin-chin.

34:05.571 --> 34:06.585
Another.

34:12.967 --> 34:14.958
Why should I care about this?

34:15.940 --> 34:18.065
Because he was asking about you.

34:18.313 --> 34:20.128
People ask about me all the time.

34:20.208 --> 34:22.697
That's how i earn my money,
that's my business.

34:23.132 --> 34:24.733
He looked familiar, you know?

34:24.813 --> 34:26.217
Like I've seen him before.

34:26.538 --> 34:28.130
It sort of strange.

34:28.174 --> 34:29.597
Suspicious.

34:30.583 --> 34:31.733
Like a criminal?

34:31.790 --> 34:33.226
Was he packing or something?

34:33.462 --> 34:35.183
Not like that, you know.

34:35.571 --> 34:37.193
Take a look around down there.

34:37.313 --> 34:38.793
What do you see?

34:41.842 --> 34:43.172
Lot of people.

34:43.223 --> 34:44.330
People.

34:44.913 --> 34:47.915
I see criminals, all of them,
fucking criminals.

34:49.360 --> 34:51.146
Are you done wasting my time here?

34:51.188 --> 34:52.177
Sorry.

34:52.396 --> 34:54.025
- I just...
- You just what?

34:56.976 --> 34:58.551
Don't you got things to attend to?

34:58.671 --> 34:59.682
Yeah.

34:59.802 --> 35:01.368
- You got it.
- Good.

35:22.973 --> 35:24.911
- Oh fuck.
- Hey.

35:25.845 --> 35:28.394
- Good morning to you, sunshine.
- What?

35:28.848 --> 35:31.062
Afternoon, actually.

35:32.423 --> 35:34.023
Coffee's brewing.

35:37.279 --> 35:38.667
Don't worry.

35:38.787 --> 35:40.685
I didn't take advantage of you.

35:42.205 --> 35:45.115
I would've, you passed out cold at 5 AM.

35:49.179 --> 35:50.664
I feel like shit.

35:50.784 --> 35:53.073
Yeah, tell me about it
and i gotta go to work.

35:54.505 --> 35:55.963
What do you do?

35:56.852 --> 35:58.034
I dance at Passions.

35:59.435 --> 36:00.502
Cool.

36:00.707 --> 36:03.374
The manager hates me,
put me on the day shift.

36:04.139 --> 36:06.580
Believe me, i work for every dollar.

36:06.802 --> 36:08.785
I know the feeling.

36:09.622 --> 36:11.596
Try and drink it.

36:12.228 --> 36:13.615
I gotta go.

36:14.006 --> 36:15.581
You're gonna be at the Saturn later?

36:16.203 --> 36:18.435
Yeah, probably.

36:21.868 --> 36:22.819
Marlena...

36:28.704 --> 36:29.851
I'll see you later.

37:38.300 --> 37:39.696
The shipment came in.

37:40.558 --> 37:41.598
Good.

37:42.153 --> 37:43.949
Can we get it unloaded tonight?

37:44.069 --> 37:46.635
- No, we gotta wait three days.
- Three days?

37:46.741 --> 37:49.845
- Why? - It's the only way we
can avoid that prick at customs.

37:50.841 --> 37:52.308
You think it'll go bad?

37:52.982 --> 37:54.298
It better not.

37:54.342 --> 37:56.378
I'll got a lot of money
invested in this.

38:07.771 --> 38:09.347
Some sick shit.

38:09.667 --> 38:12.308
Must be chilly up there
on your moral high ground.

38:30.629 --> 38:31.776
Can i help you?

38:31.896 --> 38:33.927
Yeah, i was wondering if...

38:36.846 --> 38:38.402
I'm so sorry...

38:38.446 --> 38:40.820
...you haven't been here for a while.

38:40.940 --> 38:42.419
I'll get Mike.

38:45.985 --> 38:47.628
Hey, it's Holly.

38:48.125 --> 38:49.610
Jaron's here to see you.

38:50.304 --> 38:52.636
Yeah, that's him.

38:53.143 --> 38:54.868
I'm good with faces.

38:56.166 --> 38:57.263
Okay.

38:59.717 --> 39:01.024
Do...

39:01.139 --> 39:03.973
- You want something to drink?
- No, thank you.

39:17.181 --> 39:18.159
Jaron.

39:18.745 --> 39:20.372
What brings you back, brother?

39:20.492 --> 39:22.799
I was in the neighborhood.

39:25.510 --> 39:27.324
You haven't been here
for a couple years.

39:27.350 --> 39:28.711
About three.

39:28.933 --> 39:30.373
Where you've been?

39:31.645 --> 39:34.481
North of here,
you know, way out of the city.

39:40.973 --> 39:43.152
Rayborn or Angola?

39:46.164 --> 39:47.489
It's none of my business.

39:47.551 --> 39:49.898
I just want to let you know
it's no big thing.

39:50.018 --> 39:51.907
Come on back,
come on back.

39:53.418 --> 39:55.250
Quincy's looking to buy?

39:55.757 --> 39:57.242
Yeah, he told me to stop by.

39:57.322 --> 39:59.403
You tell him
i said thank you.

39:59.523 --> 40:01.739
I'd love to be in business
with him again.

40:01.935 --> 40:04.789
I got some new stuff he'd like,
let me show you.

40:07.163 --> 40:08.266
What do you think?

40:10.169 --> 40:11.778
You can't tell right of...

40:12.017 --> 40:13.884
...three times the usual power.

40:14.004 --> 40:16.116
- Yeah?
- Try it out.

40:17.951 --> 40:19.524
Just charge it,
quick try it out.

40:19.644 --> 40:20.360
Okay.

40:24.381 --> 40:26.524
There's nothing it won't stop.

40:27.493 --> 40:28.791
Here's the other thing.

40:33.448 --> 40:35.479
The latest in tranq-gun.

40:35.496 --> 40:37.710
I know the laws are little dicey...

40:37.732 --> 40:39.489
when it comes to
using them on humans...

40:39.703 --> 40:41.175
...the way I figured though...

40:41.225 --> 40:42.865
I'd rather have you drop me with this...

40:42.915 --> 40:44.145
...than a real bullet.

40:44.181 --> 40:45.475
That's the idea.

40:49.937 --> 40:51.816
- You mind if I...
- Yeah, yeah.

40:58.275 --> 40:59.401
So what do you think?

41:01.264 --> 41:02.936
I know, i know.

41:03.192 --> 41:05.629
Quincy's got to see them first.

41:06.731 --> 41:08.185
You're good for it.

41:08.305 --> 41:09.181
You want both?

41:11.756 --> 41:13.705
He's gonna want to see both, yeah.

41:17.636 --> 41:19.948
You'll be back with an answer soon, right?

41:20.506 --> 41:21.829
Like always, okay?

41:21.879 --> 41:23.629
That's right, like always.

41:23.672 --> 41:24.973
- Good seeing you, brother.
- Yeah.

42:38.290 --> 42:39.414
It's a girl.

43:45.766 --> 43:47.295
It's gonna be a fucking mess in there.

43:47.338 --> 43:49.095
Who cares, open it up.

44:15.127 --> 44:15.881
Go!

44:16.470 --> 44:17.430
Come on!

44:19.884 --> 44:20.726
Move it!

44:22.775 --> 44:24.510
Get in the van.
Gt in the van!

44:24.546 --> 44:25.736
In the van!

44:28.082 --> 44:30.052
You didn't give them buckets to shit in?

44:30.465 --> 44:32.753
That container was in
the sun for three days.

44:32.796 --> 44:34.788
They're probably drinking their own piss.

44:35.449 --> 44:37.456
Make sure you get their mouths washed out.

44:37.576 --> 44:38.750
We're missing one.

44:53.354 --> 44:54.073
Shit!

44:54.457 --> 44:56.107
We got a dead one in here.

44:58.425 --> 44:59.272
Fuck.

45:00.566 --> 45:02.796
Alright, get her wrapped up
and throw her in the river.

45:02.916 --> 45:04.759
Get these back, put her in the van.

45:04.816 --> 45:06.694
Get back in there!

45:08.920 --> 45:10.300
Sit down!

45:10.535 --> 45:11.847
Get them cleaned up.

45:23.006 --> 45:24.080
Hello?

45:27.006 --> 45:28.130
One second.

45:29.083 --> 45:30.172
Hang on.

45:31.181 --> 45:32.831
Okay, hang on.

45:43.092 --> 45:45.788
You're gonna invite me in
or i'm gonna have to bust it down?

45:45.831 --> 45:47.310
Hold on.

45:54.635 --> 45:55.680
Hey.

45:55.800 --> 45:57.079
Just wanted to say...

45:57.769 --> 45:59.440
- Hey.
- Hi.

46:03.354 --> 46:04.321
Jesus.

46:05.011 --> 46:07.060
I could have one bitch of a day.

46:07.180 --> 46:08.347
I can see that.

46:08.653 --> 46:09.656
You want?

46:09.692 --> 46:10.915
God, yeah.

46:11.683 --> 46:13.184
I had beer too.

46:25.057 --> 46:26.105
Thank you.

46:26.531 --> 46:28.132
For liabation.

46:28.174 --> 46:29.028
Chin-chin.

46:43.033 --> 46:44.257
So what's wrong with you?

46:49.854 --> 46:51.021
I've been thinking.

46:51.078 --> 46:53.227
Yeah? Try to avoid that.

46:57.525 --> 46:58.791
Do you think that...

46:59.189 --> 47:00.441
...people can change?

47:01.177 --> 47:04.086
I'm talking to the most basic level,
do you think that...

47:04.655 --> 47:07.603
...a truly bad person can become good
and vice versa?

47:08.649 --> 47:09.627
I don't know.

47:09.890 --> 47:12.429
I think most people are just
different shapes of assholes.

47:22.145 --> 47:23.829
Do you worry about stuff like that?

47:28.045 --> 47:29.403
What the hell are you talking about?

47:38.253 --> 47:40.070
Do you worry if you're a good person?

47:43.207 --> 47:43.981
No.

47:44.180 --> 47:45.496
I have rent to pay.

48:04.557 --> 48:05.952
So you think you're bad?

48:07.055 --> 48:08.342
That's not what i meant.

48:08.556 --> 48:09.978
I asked you a question.

48:13.541 --> 48:15.229
How bad are you?

48:16.950 --> 48:18.266
Tell me how bad you were.

48:27.168 --> 48:28.349
I have a girl.

48:28.910 --> 48:30.212
- Fuck.
- Asshole!

48:52.906 --> 48:53.859
Turn over.

49:15.026 --> 49:15.929
Fuck.

50:08.075 --> 50:09.014
Call me.

50:10.757 --> 50:12.884
Do you know where
i could find Quincy?

50:13.951 --> 50:16.159
I don't know, Saturn's usually the place.

51:19.788 --> 51:20.751
Hello?

51:20.865 --> 51:21.818
Hey.

51:22.167 --> 51:24.283
- Hey you...
- How are you?

51:24.403 --> 51:26.253
Good, what's going on?

51:26.373 --> 51:27.434
Where are you?

51:27.790 --> 51:30.249
I'm still at the port.

51:31.188 --> 51:32.540
How's it going?

51:32.625 --> 51:33.509
Good.

51:33.565 --> 51:36.347
You're getting any answers
finding out anything?

51:36.695 --> 51:39.239
Yeah, yeah... I am.

51:39.616 --> 51:40.598
Well...

51:42.449 --> 51:44.141
My real name is Jaron.

51:44.924 --> 51:46.167
Jaron?

51:46.758 --> 51:48.045
No way.

51:48.365 --> 51:49.944
You're much more of a Dylan.

51:50.064 --> 51:51.118
I am?

51:51.189 --> 51:52.925
Jaron sounds like...

51:53.402 --> 51:55.188
...a basketball player.

51:55.516 --> 51:56.504
Anything else?

51:58.460 --> 51:59.917
Yeah, yeah.

52:00.507 --> 52:01.268
What?

52:03.997 --> 52:06.565
People assumed that i've been in prison.

52:06.679 --> 52:08.347
That's why i've been away.

52:09.406 --> 52:10.815
Come home now.

52:14.170 --> 52:15.330
I can't.

52:15.387 --> 52:16.542
Yes, you can.

52:16.968 --> 52:19.301
I don't care what you did down there.

52:19.358 --> 52:21.468
Just please, come home.

53:01.944 --> 53:02.838
Jaron?

53:05.635 --> 53:07.471
- What? Not even hello?
- Hey.

53:08.675 --> 53:09.833
Hi Quincy.

53:11.432 --> 53:12.995
It's good to see you back here.

53:14.195 --> 53:16.822
I've been wrapping up
a few things...

53:17.534 --> 53:19.091
You didn't afford to come in...

53:19.356 --> 53:20.787
...for your old mate Quincy?

53:25.029 --> 53:26.793
Why don't we go upstairs to the office?

53:26.828 --> 53:28.706
We can catch up
on old times.

53:29.090 --> 53:30.622
It's quieter up there.

53:32.368 --> 53:33.324
Yeah.

53:47.644 --> 53:50.206
- Here?
- Yeah, you remember the old office.

54:06.180 --> 54:07.143
Are you good?

54:08.488 --> 54:09.451
Couldn't be better.

54:10.122 --> 54:11.057
Yourself?

54:11.476 --> 54:12.244
Yeah.

54:14.760 --> 54:18.294
Actually I've been working
as a cook for a while.

54:19.041 --> 54:20.654
Get the fuck out of here,
a chef?

54:20.702 --> 54:21.577
Yeah.

54:23.476 --> 54:25.123
Pretty good at it, actually.

54:27.186 --> 54:29.197
Bit different from what
i used to do, huh?

54:29.317 --> 54:30.411
Yeah, i'd say.

54:33.706 --> 54:34.536
Yeah.

54:36.023 --> 54:38.661
I can't believe you nearly
walked passed me down there.

54:40.881 --> 54:42.921
Sorry, i was distracted.

54:42.956 --> 54:44.890
- Things changed.
- Yeah.

54:45.288 --> 54:48.523
Look at me, i'm reevaluating
my spiritual believes.

54:48.837 --> 54:50.171
Oh yeah?

54:50.291 --> 54:54.378
You tend to do that when you bump into some
motherfucker that you killed three years ago.

55:04.097 --> 55:05.522
There you are.

55:11.950 --> 55:13.380
We need to talk.

55:15.551 --> 55:16.591
Okay.

55:18.849 --> 55:20.315
Who did you tell?

55:25.233 --> 55:27.132
I don't know what you're talking about.

55:27.900 --> 55:30.983
Who did you tell about our
little operation that's going on here?

55:32.707 --> 55:34.648
I don't know what you mean.

55:36.110 --> 55:38.393
Did you check him
for a wire?

55:38.546 --> 55:39.779
He's clean.

55:42.383 --> 55:43.974
This is how it's gonna be.

55:46.264 --> 55:49.065
I swear i don't remember anything.

55:50.028 --> 55:51.369
I don't believe you.

55:54.058 --> 55:55.308
I was in a coma.

55:55.902 --> 55:58.792
I woke up not remembering
who i was.

56:00.307 --> 56:02.740
You don't remember who you was?

56:02.803 --> 56:04.806
I don't remember anything.

56:05.265 --> 56:07.513
How the fuck did you
end up back here then?

56:08.064 --> 56:09.977
I saw a picture in the papers...

56:10.011 --> 56:11.694
I recognized the building.

56:11.736 --> 56:13.794
And i came here.

56:16.796 --> 56:18.657
You used to be a good liar.

56:20.375 --> 56:22.390
I fucking made you.

56:26.627 --> 56:28.128
You listen to me.

56:30.278 --> 56:34.076
Did I ever tell you how i got
Jesus Vasquez to talk?

56:34.858 --> 56:36.435
Of course you didn't.

56:36.742 --> 56:38.997
Cause you don't fucking remember nothing.

56:43.470 --> 56:45.726
Reggie, get my little package, please.

56:50.538 --> 56:51.816
We found your girlfriend.

56:53.687 --> 56:55.006
Cute ass.

56:57.910 --> 56:59.280
She's not my girlfriend.

56:59.315 --> 57:00.467
- Really?
- Yeah.

57:00.600 --> 57:01.828
She's not my girlfriend.

57:02.150 --> 57:03.867
I just met her, okay?

57:04.517 --> 57:06.716
You don't mind if Reggie
does this then, do you?

57:08.276 --> 57:11.397
That's better, darling.
We need you awake for this.

57:13.764 --> 57:15.677
She has nothing to do with this!

57:17.003 --> 57:19.502
I'm bored of you acting dumb, Jaron.

57:26.145 --> 57:27.918
Oh my God.

57:28.742 --> 57:30.606
You want to start talking now?

57:32.156 --> 57:33.712
Oh my God.

57:36.901 --> 57:38.702
Stop it.

57:40.350 --> 57:41.544
God...

57:41.724 --> 57:42.750
Stop!

57:53.953 --> 57:55.740
You got one more chance.

57:56.878 --> 57:58.356
Or you're next.

58:02.204 --> 58:05.101
We were in business together,
that's all i know.

58:05.599 --> 58:08.175
Some kind of business.

58:52.948 --> 58:54.302
Let's have a little chat.

58:55.664 --> 58:56.634
Sit down.

59:02.598 --> 59:03.953
What the fuck...

59:09.785 --> 59:10.944
Sit...

59:11.747 --> 59:12.948
...down.

59:27.547 --> 59:29.683
Thank God you got smokes.

59:44.862 --> 59:46.830
Neat little party trick, huh?

59:58.726 --> 01:00:01.913
You realize how unique you are, don't you?

01:00:02.179 --> 01:00:04.971
This has only happened once or twice before.

01:00:05.013 --> 01:00:08.125
This sliding back and forth
that you're doing.

01:00:12.399 --> 01:00:15.548
You are still having trouble reconciling
yourself to my presents...

01:00:15.562 --> 01:00:17.533
...i need you to snap out of it.

01:00:19.244 --> 01:00:20.507
Where am i?

01:00:22.823 --> 01:00:24.589
This place has many names...

01:00:24.652 --> 01:00:27.527
I was always fond of the Greek Tartarus.

01:00:29.955 --> 01:00:32.391
It's out of vogue these days,
which is unfortunate.

01:00:33.725 --> 01:00:35.289
This can't be real.

01:00:35.673 --> 01:00:37.795
If i had a dime for everytime i heard that.

01:00:37.838 --> 01:00:40.728
It'd be more than a road of good intentions
leading here.

01:00:41.991 --> 01:00:43.359
It's not happening.

01:00:44.616 --> 01:00:46.794
Your problem is
that it is.

01:00:46.914 --> 01:00:48.748
So if we could move along.

01:00:54.139 --> 01:00:56.290
It's not like i imagine...

01:00:56.339 --> 01:00:59.795
Which way i fly is hell,
I myself am hell.

01:01:02.432 --> 01:01:05.336
Milton and Dante were spinning
dark fantasies...

01:01:06.824 --> 01:01:09.531
...the capacity of the human minds to...

01:01:09.978 --> 01:01:13.091
...cling to fairytales
is just staggering.

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:16.584
- So who are you?
- I have many names too.

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:20.039
You can think of me as a guy...

01:01:20.081 --> 01:01:22.716
who got into really bad fight
with his boss.

01:01:22.744 --> 01:01:24.615
Did you create this place?

01:01:24.664 --> 01:01:25.872
I did not.

01:01:26.306 --> 01:01:28.030
Where do you think i fell to?

01:01:32.044 --> 01:01:34.243
I feel like it's killing me.

01:01:34.363 --> 01:01:35.735
Cause it is.

01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:38.102
You were supposed to die.

01:01:38.954 --> 01:01:43.150
The coma you were in was supposed to
segway quite nicely into death.

01:01:43.946 --> 01:01:46.445
You had one foot in the grave,
so to speak.

01:01:46.822 --> 01:01:48.406
But i woke up.

01:01:49.236 --> 01:01:50.619
That you did.

01:01:51.310 --> 01:01:52.832
I don't know how
or why.

01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:56.817
But now you're half here
half there...

01:01:57.668 --> 01:01:59.498
...and everytime you come...

01:01:59.616 --> 01:02:01.053
...you stay a little longer.

01:02:01.173 --> 01:02:03.427
You leave a little more of yourself behind.

01:02:03.957 --> 01:02:06.896
And pretty soon you'll be mine
like you're supposed to be.

01:02:08.787 --> 01:02:10.023
I am damned?

01:02:10.442 --> 01:02:12.683
The boy gets it.

01:02:15.216 --> 01:02:18.597
The things i see here,
they tied to what i did.

01:02:19.456 --> 01:02:20.880
They're abstractions.

01:02:21.714 --> 01:02:24.549
Representation of past,
present, and future.

01:02:26.415 --> 01:02:29.501
Nightmare logic, as you once put it.
I like that.

01:02:30.308 --> 01:02:31.683
I mean, why be obvious?

01:02:33.023 --> 01:02:35.351
You have an eternity
to figure it out.

01:02:48.007 --> 01:02:49.076
Marlena?

01:02:50.123 --> 01:02:51.009
Sort of.

01:02:59.984 --> 01:03:01.141
Come on.

01:03:01.930 --> 01:03:04.345
Wait til we get
to the really good stuff.

01:03:05.322 --> 01:03:08.276
Why is this happening now?
I've been awake for over a year.

01:03:08.318 --> 01:03:11.459
Let's just say there's no such thing
as coincidence.

01:03:16.211 --> 01:03:18.067
You've been giving me clues.

01:03:18.116 --> 01:03:19.156
Have I?

01:03:20.776 --> 01:03:22.616
If I figured it out...

01:03:23.042 --> 01:03:25.067
...can i have a way
of ending up here?

01:03:25.187 --> 01:03:27.398
Just remember you're talking to.

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:29.164
I don't know what I did.

01:03:29.493 --> 01:03:31.159
Best amnesia.

01:03:33.867 --> 01:03:35.724
You want something.

01:03:36.115 --> 01:03:37.658
I always do.

01:03:38.307 --> 01:03:39.878
But you do too.

01:03:41.086 --> 01:03:42.406
And that's your problem.

01:03:49.355 --> 01:03:50.721
You're running out of time.

01:03:51.628 --> 01:03:53.171
Tick tock,
tick tock.

01:03:55.714 --> 01:03:58.011
- I've a parting gift to you.
- What?

01:03:58.775 --> 01:04:00.345
Your memory.

01:06:04.637 --> 01:06:05.649
Interesting.

01:06:07.143 --> 01:06:08.198
St Helia.

01:06:08.672 --> 01:06:10.606
The Patron Saint of Attrition.

01:06:11.214 --> 01:06:13.166
I've never seen anyone
light it before.

01:06:14.297 --> 01:06:16.021
I don't know what attrition is.

01:06:18.490 --> 01:06:19.824
It's...

01:06:19.944 --> 01:06:21.731
...imperfect grace.

01:06:22.646 --> 01:06:25.173
Repents out of fear of damnation.

01:06:25.517 --> 01:06:27.248
Not the love of God.

01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:29.447
It ain't the right one?

01:06:30.413 --> 01:06:33.094
I'm surprised that there's even
a candle for it.

01:06:33.214 --> 01:06:35.441
Many people consider attrition a sin.

01:06:35.846 --> 01:06:37.745
How can repenance be wrong?

01:06:37.801 --> 01:06:39.983
If it's done for the wrong reasons.

01:06:40.744 --> 01:06:42.432
True repenance...

01:06:42.488 --> 01:06:44.435
...comes from acceptance.

01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:46.279
Self knowledge.

01:06:46.399 --> 01:06:49.528
And it's made without hoping
for anything in return.

01:06:51.446 --> 01:06:55.118
Come on, everybody that comes in here
want something in return.

01:06:56.821 --> 01:06:58.106
Some do.

01:06:58.559 --> 01:07:01.004
Others come to seek enlightment.

01:07:02.087 --> 01:07:05.174
And others come because they've been
grazed by the Holy Spirit.

01:07:06.409 --> 01:07:07.527
Sometimes...

01:07:07.647 --> 01:07:08.559
...all three.

01:07:11.003 --> 01:07:12.015
How about you?

01:07:13.323 --> 01:07:15.494
You feel Christ has led you here?

01:07:16.507 --> 01:07:18.128
Different guy,
same employer.

01:07:19.538 --> 01:07:21.492
I'm not exactly sure
I know what you...

01:07:21.541 --> 01:07:23.461
Long story.

01:07:27.217 --> 01:07:28.641
Listen...

01:07:29.095 --> 01:07:31.150
I'm sorry for asking this, but...

01:07:32.874 --> 01:07:34.040
...you don't look well.

01:07:34.897 --> 01:07:35.735
Are you sick?

01:07:46.515 --> 01:07:48.443
Would you like for me
to hear your confession?

01:07:51.326 --> 01:07:53.014
It might help.

01:08:02.142 --> 01:08:04.229
I think i'm way passed that.

01:08:05.576 --> 01:08:06.288
Hey...

01:08:07.231 --> 01:08:08.822
...no matter how big your sin is...

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:12.620
God has seen it before.

01:08:13.887 --> 01:08:15.493
And others have surpassed it.

01:08:17.301 --> 01:08:18.848
God is generous.

01:08:20.852 --> 01:08:22.687
He would judge accordingly.

01:08:27.975 --> 01:08:29.314
That's what i have to do.

01:08:31.621 --> 01:08:32.506
What?

01:08:33.345 --> 01:08:34.287
Judicate.

01:08:36.368 --> 01:08:37.939
No...

01:08:38.903 --> 01:08:40.772
...remember, judgement...

01:08:41.323 --> 01:08:42.580
...is God's job.

01:08:43.812 --> 01:08:45.354
Let's hope so.

01:12:04.226 --> 01:12:05.406
How much is my share?

01:12:16.371 --> 01:12:17.405
You keep up the good work...

01:12:17.447 --> 01:12:19.213
...there will plenty more
where that came from.

01:12:55.349 --> 01:12:56.760
It's for you to understand.

01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:59.535
You can do pretty much anything
you want to...

01:12:59.577 --> 01:13:02.760
...you can tell her your problems,
fuck her in the ass, i don't care.

01:13:03.426 --> 01:13:06.121
Just don't hit them in the face,
they gotta work.

01:13:07.552 --> 01:13:08.383
Alright?

01:13:08.621 --> 01:13:09.828
Uh-um.

01:13:11.241 --> 01:13:12.302
Hey baby.

01:13:15.722 --> 01:13:16.783
Okay.

01:13:17.837 --> 01:13:19.240
You want one of the young ones?

01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:21.899
They're barely budding.

01:13:22.401 --> 01:13:24.175
The older ones aren't quite as ripe...

01:13:24.217 --> 01:13:26.116
...but they know what they're doing.

01:13:28.432 --> 01:13:29.319
Have fun.

01:14:15.864 --> 01:14:16.611
See?

01:14:16.731 --> 01:14:17.687
I feel him kick.

01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:20.283
Do you feel it?

01:14:20.486 --> 01:14:22.015
He's so strong.

01:14:22.810 --> 01:14:23.844
My baby.

01:14:29.382 --> 01:14:30.723
How do you know
it's a boy?

01:14:32.170 --> 01:14:34.837
I saw his father back
in my country and...

01:14:37.705 --> 01:14:38.641
I just know.

01:14:43.638 --> 01:14:45.005
- Mitcha.
- Yo.

01:14:45.759 --> 01:14:46.953
We need to talk.

01:14:58.752 --> 01:14:59.543
What?

01:15:00.357 --> 01:15:01.488
We got a problem.

01:15:03.325 --> 01:15:05.175
One of the girls saw me
clipped Williams.

01:15:05.964 --> 01:15:07.695
How do you know?

01:15:09.356 --> 01:15:10.173
This.

01:15:14.264 --> 01:15:17.339
This is bullshit, it's not signed,
we'll never know who it is.

01:15:17.563 --> 01:15:18.875
That's the point.

01:15:18.995 --> 01:15:19.855
What?

01:15:22.725 --> 01:15:24.334
These girls get talking.

01:15:24.913 --> 01:15:26.484
They're gonna come up
with some crazy ideas...

01:15:26.519 --> 01:15:28.683
...and see if they can get a deal
for amnesty.

01:15:28.864 --> 01:15:30.686
If they get out,
which they won't.

01:15:31.161 --> 01:15:32.935
What about if one of them
talk to a client?

01:15:32.998 --> 01:15:35.930
Before you know, all this shit will
be on the fucking internet.

01:15:36.007 --> 01:15:37.689
What are you gonna do?
Torture each one of them...

01:15:37.744 --> 01:15:40.307
...til you find out who it is?
They'll all confess.

01:15:40.355 --> 01:15:41.346
Fuck that.

01:15:41.535 --> 01:15:43.162
It's not as if we can't replace them.

01:15:46.302 --> 01:15:47.684
You can't be serious.

01:15:47.928 --> 01:15:49.625
When was the last time
you congratulate me...

01:15:49.667 --> 01:15:51.049
...on my sense of humor?

01:15:52.027 --> 01:15:53.256
Okay.

01:15:53.298 --> 01:15:56.314
There are million different ways
we can handle this.

01:15:57.125 --> 01:15:57.886
Okay.

01:15:59.059 --> 01:16:00.281
Give me one.

01:16:02.982 --> 01:16:03.973
What?

01:16:04.294 --> 01:16:06.575
There's a conscience building up in there,
now is it?

01:16:07.950 --> 01:16:09.602
I'll beef up security.

01:16:09.986 --> 01:16:12.409
I'll keep them quiet.
Me, I'll do it.

01:16:12.479 --> 01:16:15.052
Listen, they'll all fucking OD
or get sick anyway.

01:16:15.172 --> 01:16:16.609
I say we take the garbage out now.

01:16:16.729 --> 01:16:18.070
No, no.

01:16:18.803 --> 01:16:20.018
No?

01:16:20.381 --> 01:16:23.054
Just remind me who the fuck
is in charge here.

01:16:24.863 --> 01:16:26.783
Stop with the theatric, please.

01:16:26.903 --> 01:16:28.172
I can't let you do this.

01:16:29.192 --> 01:16:30.999
Think of the fucking money.

01:16:35.253 --> 01:16:36.070
Yeah.

01:16:37.327 --> 01:16:39.576
Now get the fuck out
of my way.

01:16:40.952 --> 01:16:41.978
Now.

01:16:57.615 --> 01:16:59.465
It's just business.

01:20:18.542 --> 01:20:19.509
Stand back.

01:20:20.012 --> 01:20:21.003
Come on.

01:20:21.785 --> 01:20:23.337
Shit!

01:20:53.398 --> 01:20:55.776
You must have a fucking death wish.

01:21:00.141 --> 01:21:02.487
Stop playing around!

01:21:03.474 --> 01:21:04.891
We killed them.

01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:06.944
You're fucking righteous with me?

01:21:08.075 --> 01:21:10.921
You worked, and you enjoy the fucking money.

01:21:21.277 --> 01:21:23.049
What the fuck is going on here?

01:21:23.169 --> 01:21:24.347
Welcome back.

01:21:25.718 --> 01:21:27.150
You brought me a present.

01:21:28.881 --> 01:21:30.299
Who is this?

01:21:33.187 --> 01:21:34.067
Shut up.

01:21:36.183 --> 01:21:37.341
I know what i did.

01:21:39.992 --> 01:21:41.039
And?

01:21:42.763 --> 01:21:44.543
You know that old saying...

01:21:44.663 --> 01:21:46.508
"truth will set you free"?

01:21:46.857 --> 01:21:48.456
That's bullshit right there.

01:21:48.819 --> 01:21:50.313
The truth that got me here...

01:21:51.453 --> 01:21:52.891
That's interesting.

01:21:54.043 --> 01:21:55.445
You're trying to make a deal?

01:21:55.668 --> 01:21:56.673
No.

01:21:58.084 --> 01:21:59.181
He's yours.

01:21:59.223 --> 01:22:00.249
Always has been.

01:22:00.291 --> 01:22:01.450
What are you talking about?

01:22:01.499 --> 01:22:04.105
I am in the midst of a discussion...

01:22:04.873 --> 01:22:05.843
Yeah?

01:22:06.904 --> 01:22:08.323
Fucking try and discuss this.

01:22:18.211 --> 01:22:19.265
Stop it.

01:22:21.547 --> 01:22:22.671
What is this?

01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:26.040
Come on.

01:22:27.192 --> 01:22:28.762
You don't want anything?

01:22:31.026 --> 01:22:32.960
Do you know what it's like to...

01:22:33.571 --> 01:22:35.546
...not have a clue who you are?

01:22:36.656 --> 01:22:39.028
When i left the hospital,
I was searching...

01:22:39.062 --> 01:22:40.829
...and everything that I did...

01:22:40.843 --> 01:22:43.237
...it's to feel what kind of person I was.

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:46.826
Good people recycle,
bad people they...

01:22:47.015 --> 01:22:49.200
...cut other drivers off in traffic.

01:22:49.633 --> 01:22:52.286
I made a life of myself,
a mediocre life.

01:22:53.734 --> 01:22:56.631
I was half living,
by following those rules, but...

01:22:56.751 --> 01:22:58.330
I was scared.

01:22:59.810 --> 01:23:01.772
I was scared because i thought that I had...

01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:03.695
...cheated somebody out of money or...

01:23:04.183 --> 01:23:05.894
...been involved in a robbery.

01:23:09.545 --> 01:23:10.822
I didn't know.

01:23:13.492 --> 01:23:14.567
I didn't know.

01:23:17.595 --> 01:23:18.663
You knew.

01:23:21.061 --> 01:23:22.290
So come on.

01:23:24.056 --> 01:23:25.707
You don't want anything?

01:23:32.733 --> 01:23:33.757
No?

01:23:35.224 --> 01:23:36.906
I don't know how else to say it.

01:23:40.271 --> 01:23:41.437
I belong here.

01:23:43.006 --> 01:23:44.556
Wherever God wants me.

01:23:52.013 --> 01:23:53.933
I have no use for you anymore.

01:24:03.869 --> 01:24:05.719
I've had enough of this fucking shit.

01:24:10.276 --> 01:24:12.193
You really shouldn't have done that.

01:24:14.664 --> 01:24:16.778
We're gonna have a lot of fun.

01:26:50.177 --> 01:26:53.454
Ring leader, Quincy Roland,
presumed dead by police.

01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:57.823
They've closed investigation of the
human trafficking and prostitution ring.

01:26:58.074 --> 01:26:59.918
In other news,
it is still a hot one.

01:26:59.966 --> 01:27:02.687
The Department of Water and Power
still urging us...

01:27:02.721 --> 01:27:04.984
...all to do our part and conserve energy.

01:27:05.018 --> 01:27:06.821
Wait a second.

01:27:42.605 --> 01:27:44.937
You're gonna tell me
what happened down there?

01:27:49.925 --> 01:27:51.245
What did you do?

01:27:54.382 --> 01:27:55.359
Nothing.

01:27:57.014 --> 01:27:58.040
I did nothing.
