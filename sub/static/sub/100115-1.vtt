00:09.676 --> 00:11.803
It's been a quiet few months
in Riverdale.

00:12.554 --> 00:18.018
Spring slid into summer,
and some semblance of normal life resumed.

00:20.186 --> 00:24.274
The terrors of the Farm weren't forgotten,
but they had started to fade.

00:25.900 --> 00:29.988
Gryphons and Gargoyles was already
becoming the stuff of suburban legend.

00:30.697 --> 00:34.743
Indeed, the big topic of conversation
around town was July 4th.

00:35.994 --> 00:37.954
After some debate, it was decided

00:38.038 --> 00:40.665
that there would be an Independence Day
parade down Main Street,

00:41.041 --> 00:43.293
Riverdale's first in three years.

00:44.794 --> 00:47.922
But there would be no fireworks display
over Sweetwater River.

00:48.631 --> 00:50.300
The Blossoms used to sponsor them,

00:50.383 --> 00:52.761
but without their support,
the town couldn't afford them.

00:54.179 --> 00:57.724
Like I said...
things had been pretty quiet lately.

00:58.391 --> 01:01.102
Enough that I'd actually gotten
some real writing done.

01:06.816 --> 01:07.816
It's beautiful.

01:08.985 --> 01:10.862
- It's a beautiful story, Jug.
- Really?

01:11.780 --> 01:13.656
You think it's worth submitting
to the contest?

01:13.907 --> 01:16.367
No, I think it's gonna win the contest.

01:17.535 --> 01:18.535
I love you.

01:18.787 --> 01:19.787
I love you, too.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.083
Can we just stay in bed forever?

01:25.919 --> 01:28.087
And if not forever, at least for the day?

01:29.839 --> 01:30.839
I would.

01:31.883 --> 01:35.053
But don't we have to finish building a
float for your big Fourth of July parade?

01:35.136 --> 01:38.848
It's not my parade, it's the town's.
Pop's is only sponsoring it.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.769
Well, if not the day...

01:44.521 --> 01:45.688
how about another hour?

01:46.314 --> 01:47.314
Hell, yeah.

01:48.024 --> 01:49.024
Okay, then.

02:00.829 --> 02:01.955
Good morning, Jay-Jay.

02:03.206 --> 02:05.208
Let's see what the hot gossip in town
is today.

02:05.834 --> 02:09.211
And then we'll do the cross... word.

02:10.045 --> 02:11.045
What the hell?

02:11.506 --> 02:12.841
Over my dead body!

02:13.466 --> 02:17.846
♪ All my friends are watching,
I can hear them talking ♪

02:17.929 --> 02:22.350
♪ All my friends are watching,
I can hear them talking ♪

02:22.433 --> 02:26.563
♪ All my friends are watching,
I can hear them talking ♪

02:26.646 --> 02:28.148
♪ Tell me what's going on ♪

02:31.484 --> 02:32.527
Well, well, well...

02:33.361 --> 02:34.362
Stop the presses.

02:34.821 --> 02:37.323
The Riverdale rag finally reported
a story accurately.

02:38.283 --> 02:40.493
Not only is there going to be
some hideous,

02:40.577 --> 02:42.257
janky parade snaking its way through town,

02:42.620 --> 02:44.789
you four are the architects
of this outrage.

02:45.039 --> 02:48.209
- What's your problem, Cheryl?
- My problem, Veronica,

02:48.626 --> 02:52.005
is that the Fourth of July
is a day of tragedy for Riverdale,

02:52.338 --> 02:53.548
not celebration.

02:54.173 --> 02:56.676
Or have you forgotten what happened
to my poor brother Jason.

02:56.759 --> 02:59.387
Cheryl, Riverdale hasn't held a parade
out of respect

02:59.470 --> 03:03.182
for what happened to your brother
in... like, years.

03:03.266 --> 03:04.642
I think it's time.

03:04.767 --> 03:07.854
I mean... you don't have to come.

03:08.146 --> 03:10.857
Oh, I'll be there, insufferable Smurf.

03:11.482 --> 03:12.482
Front and center.

03:12.984 --> 03:14.527
With a sign of protest in one hand

03:14.611 --> 03:17.947
and a horn of compressed air
to silence any revelry in the other.

03:24.746 --> 03:25.746
Great.

03:27.332 --> 03:28.750
Anyone hungry for breakfast?

03:29.792 --> 03:32.378
So, camping this weekend, are we still on?

03:33.254 --> 03:36.174
I'm open, but what are we
talking about here? Like...

03:36.341 --> 03:37.675
The woods.

03:37.759 --> 03:41.262
But remember, this could... possibly be
our last summer to do this

03:41.346 --> 03:44.224
because next year
we'll be getting ready to go to college.

03:44.599 --> 03:49.229
And if anyone is scared of bears, well,
don't be, because Archie's been attacked,

03:49.312 --> 03:51.356
like, what, multiple times
and still survived?

03:51.689 --> 03:53.483
Hey, I wear my scars proudly.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.073
Hey, Dad.

04:17.632 --> 04:18.632
Archie.

04:31.604 --> 04:35.275
I... I talked to the sheriff
up in Cherry Creek.

04:38.027 --> 04:40.738
Sounds like... what happened was

04:40.822 --> 04:44.409
Fred was... driving home to Riverdale
when he...

04:47.078 --> 04:51.207
He pulled over to help someone whose car
had stalled on the side of the road and...

04:55.211 --> 05:00.341
another vehicle... came up on them
way too fast and... And...

05:01.342 --> 05:03.469
And he was struck by it.

05:03.720 --> 05:04.720
No.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.138
No.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.016
I'm sorry, Mary.

05:08.975 --> 05:10.018
I'm sorry, Archie.

05:10.643 --> 05:11.811
Did the other car stop?

05:13.563 --> 05:14.563
The one that...?

05:16.357 --> 05:17.734
So, it was a hit-and-run.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.506
We have to find out who did it.
We have to catch them.

05:22.530 --> 05:23.698
No, Red.

05:24.407 --> 05:26.159
You don't even think about that right now.

05:26.868 --> 05:28.988
I'll work with the sheriff's office
up in Cherry Creek

05:29.037 --> 05:31.372
and make sure all this is taken care of.
You understand?

05:34.083 --> 05:35.168
So, what happens now?

05:37.003 --> 05:39.422
Have you decided on a burial
or a cremation?

05:39.672 --> 05:40.672
Burial.

05:41.049 --> 05:44.886
There's a plot next to his father,
Artie Andrews. Arthur Andrews.

05:47.430 --> 05:50.141
Since we're transporting the body
from upstate,

05:50.767 --> 05:53.811
there will be an additional cost
of $9,000.

05:54.896 --> 05:58.024
Whatever needs to be done.
However much it costs.

05:59.901 --> 06:02.904
The driver that makes these trips for us
isn't available until July 5th

06:03.237 --> 06:04.405
because of the holiday.

06:04.781 --> 06:08.034
Then we'll have the internment on the 6th,
if that's all right.

06:11.162 --> 06:14.290
Hey. You remember that tree house
your dad helped us build?

06:14.874 --> 06:17.877
- You mean the one he built for us?
- I remember you fell out of it, Reg.

06:18.836 --> 06:19.836
And broke my arm.

06:20.671 --> 06:22.031
Your dad drove me to the hospital.

06:23.883 --> 06:25.301
I remember this one time...

06:27.887 --> 06:30.765
This time, we were having a picnic

06:30.848 --> 06:34.102
when we were still in grade school
in Pickens Park,

06:34.352 --> 06:39.107
and there was a father-daughter
potato-sack race.

06:40.650 --> 06:41.818
My dad...

06:43.736 --> 06:48.533
I don't know where he was, but Mr. Andrews
said that he would do it with me.

06:51.869 --> 06:54.622
So, he was... He was my dad for the day.

06:56.791 --> 06:59.794
When things started getting bad
with my dad and drinking,

07:00.878 --> 07:04.674
my mom would call up Fred... for help.

07:06.217 --> 07:07.468
And he would drive to the bar,

07:08.678 --> 07:10.959
and he would pick up my dad
and he'd lay him on the couch.

07:14.350 --> 07:17.812
But he'd always stay a little while.
Just to talk to me.

07:20.314 --> 07:24.193
To see how I was doing in school
and... if I had eaten dinner.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.673
He just wanted to know if I was hungry.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.283
I always was.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.621
Your dad was such a gentleman, Archie.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.123
He was the best.

07:38.207 --> 07:40.710
He built and donated all the sets
for the musicals.

07:43.838 --> 07:45.256
You don't have to, but...

07:46.507 --> 07:48.593
do you have any memories you wanna share?

07:51.387 --> 07:52.387
I remember going to...

07:54.599 --> 07:56.976
Going to Sears with him.
Just so I could ride the tractors.

08:05.359 --> 08:06.359
He taught me everything.

08:09.363 --> 08:13.159
Taught me how to play football
and baseball.

08:13.284 --> 08:14.535
Pretty much every other sport.

08:17.788 --> 08:19.957
We fixed up the... The jalopy together.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.378
He bought me my first guitar.

08:26.923 --> 08:29.050
He even soundproofed the garage just so...

08:33.596 --> 08:34.847
Hey. Archie.

08:35.139 --> 08:36.140
I'm good. I just...

08:36.640 --> 08:38.893
I'm wiped out, you guys.
Can we call it a day?

08:39.602 --> 08:40.602
Yeah.

09:40.997 --> 09:42.164
Grandpa Artie?

09:44.208 --> 09:45.208
Archie.

09:46.043 --> 09:47.043
Everyone's waiting.

09:47.628 --> 09:48.628
Where's your dad?

09:50.131 --> 09:51.131
I thought...

09:52.633 --> 09:55.803
- I thought he was already with you.
- No. No.

09:56.304 --> 09:57.430
Come see for yourself.

10:24.248 --> 10:25.248
Where's Dad?

10:26.876 --> 10:30.087
Archie... you were supposed to get him.

10:35.343 --> 10:36.343
Archie?

10:41.265 --> 10:42.475
I have to go get my dad.

10:44.935 --> 10:46.187
What? What do you mean?

10:47.021 --> 10:48.022
I have to bring him home.

11:11.295 --> 11:12.380
She's all yours, bro.

11:13.214 --> 11:15.132
How do you even have a hearse, Reggie?

11:15.466 --> 11:17.946
It's been sitting on the lot for years.
No one wants to buy it.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.096
Well, I owe you, Reg. Thank you.

11:20.388 --> 11:22.306
And, you guys,
I'm sorry for calling so late.

11:22.890 --> 11:24.130
It's really not a problem, man.

11:24.600 --> 11:27.311
I just... I don't want my dad stuck
in some weird town.

11:29.063 --> 11:31.543
And I can't wait for after July 4th
for them to bring him back.

11:32.274 --> 11:33.554
He'd wanna be home, I know that.

11:48.999 --> 11:50.501
Hi. I'm Archie Andrews.

11:51.085 --> 11:53.921
My dad, Fred Andrews, was in an accident
on the freeway yesterday.

11:54.588 --> 11:58.050
Oh, yeah. I heard about that.
I'm sorry for your loss.

11:58.676 --> 11:59.676
Thank you, ma'am.

12:00.094 --> 12:02.304
I was wondering
if you found the person responsible yet.

12:04.181 --> 12:06.976
We got a description
of the car that hit your dad.

12:07.101 --> 12:09.520
The make and the model,
but no plate number.

12:09.854 --> 12:12.189
Nothing yet, but we're not giving up.

12:12.481 --> 12:13.481
Okay.

12:15.651 --> 12:16.694
Hello?

12:17.653 --> 12:19.071
What happened to my dad's truck?

12:19.321 --> 12:21.841
It's still at the accident site,
parked on the side of the road.

12:22.533 --> 12:24.452
Okay.
Would you mind showing me where that is?

12:29.039 --> 12:31.584
It's a few miles south on Route 80.

12:31.834 --> 12:34.295
Right about... here.

12:35.171 --> 12:38.299
The keys are with the rest of your
father's belonging's at the funeral home.

12:38.674 --> 12:39.674
Okay.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.845
That was them, actually.
They're ready for us.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.390
- Thank you, deputy.
- Of course.

12:47.308 --> 12:48.308
You hang in there, okay?

12:50.311 --> 12:51.311
Thank you.

12:54.773 --> 12:56.192
Hi. Good morning.

12:56.942 --> 12:58.986
I'm Veronica Lodge. We just spoke.

12:59.487 --> 13:02.323
- This is Archie Andrews. He's...
- I'm Fred Andrews' son.

13:02.406 --> 13:05.117
Yes. Of course. My condolences.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.148
How can I help you, Mr. Andrews?

13:07.953 --> 13:09.997
I wanna bring my dad home.

13:13.125 --> 13:14.668
It was my understanding

13:14.752 --> 13:17.630
the deceased would be transported
to Riverdale on the 5th.

13:17.713 --> 13:19.757
I know. It's... It's not right. I...

13:21.300 --> 13:22.300
I want him home.

13:23.552 --> 13:25.554
And I wanna be the one
who brings him home, today.

13:27.681 --> 13:30.684
I understand.
But I'm afraid that's not possible.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.275
- Hello?
- Hey, Mom.

13:39.193 --> 13:41.362
Archie?
Aren't you upstairs in your bedroom?

13:41.445 --> 13:44.865
No, I'm in Cherry Creek.
I came up to pick up Dad.

13:44.990 --> 13:45.990
What?

13:46.200 --> 13:47.535
I'm sorry, I didn't think.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.581
The funeral home up here
won't release Dad to me.

13:51.163 --> 13:53.666
Something about me being underage.

13:55.042 --> 13:56.042
Please.

13:57.586 --> 13:59.046
I really don't wanna leave Dad here.

14:00.130 --> 14:01.890
Put me on the phone
with whoever's in charge.

14:07.513 --> 14:08.513
I see.

14:10.140 --> 14:11.820
No, that won't be necessary, Mrs. Andrews.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.773
Of course. I'll just need you
to sign an authorization form and...

14:18.482 --> 14:19.859
Nope. I'll do it right now.

14:20.776 --> 14:21.776
Thank you.

14:24.530 --> 14:27.199
I'll just go
get your father's personal effects, then.

14:27.825 --> 14:30.578
- There was a set of truck keys.
- They're in there.

14:31.662 --> 14:35.708
I'm going to need two to three hours
to get him ready for transport.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.544
You can wait here
or you can come back at noon.

14:39.169 --> 14:40.169
Can I see him?

14:42.381 --> 14:43.841
Archie, you don't have to.

14:44.675 --> 14:46.195
What if they made a mistake, you guys?

14:48.429 --> 14:50.931
- I'd like to see my father.
- Of course.

14:51.849 --> 14:54.560
He's just in the next room,
if you'd like to follow me.

15:20.502 --> 15:21.502
Archie.

15:32.681 --> 15:33.557
I thought...

15:33.641 --> 15:35.267
Archie changed his mind.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.395
But he asked us to make sure it's him.

16:11.345 --> 16:14.848
- Jug, one thing you can help me with:
- Anything.

16:15.557 --> 16:16.725
My dad's obituary.

16:18.602 --> 16:20.688
Could you write it? For the Register?

16:21.146 --> 16:22.146
Of course.

16:31.323 --> 16:32.323
Is it him?

16:36.036 --> 16:37.079
Yes. It is.

16:39.456 --> 16:40.666
I have his belongings.

16:43.669 --> 16:44.669
Are you sure?

16:47.423 --> 16:48.424
Yeah, Arch.

16:50.843 --> 16:51.843
It's your dad.

17:00.853 --> 17:06.150
Mrs. Andrews, we heard the news,
and we're so, so sorry about Mr. Andrews.

17:06.692 --> 17:07.692
Thank you.

17:09.403 --> 17:10.403
Mrs. Andrews.

17:12.239 --> 17:16.492
When my brother Jason died,
I felt supremely alone.

17:18.579 --> 17:22.583
My world was only darkness and despair.

17:25.002 --> 17:28.630
I don't want you or Archie to ever feel
anything even remotely like that.

17:31.425 --> 17:34.094
So... with your blessing,

17:35.512 --> 17:37.931
there's something I'd like to do
for your family.

17:38.932 --> 17:40.142
For when Archie returns.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.160
Can we help you?

19:25.581 --> 19:27.916
No, I'm just paying my respects.

19:28.125 --> 19:29.525
How do you know what happened here?

19:32.921 --> 19:33.921
Wait, are...?

19:34.756 --> 19:35.756
Are you Archie?

19:36.800 --> 19:38.010
How do you know my name?

19:40.304 --> 19:41.346
Your father told me.

19:47.144 --> 19:51.773
One of my tires blew,
and... I was stranded out here.

19:54.776 --> 19:56.278
You're the one he was helping.

20:01.158 --> 20:04.244
I mean, cars just...
You know, they kept...

20:05.787 --> 20:08.707
They kept whizzing by.
Nobody would stop, but your dad did.

20:13.462 --> 20:15.297
He talked about you the entire time.

20:17.090 --> 20:19.509
His... His son.

20:19.968 --> 20:20.968
How...

20:21.637 --> 20:25.390
he couldn't believe a man like him was
blessed with such a thoughtful, kind boy.

20:26.975 --> 20:28.435
You were with him when he...?

20:29.728 --> 20:31.146
We were working on the tire.

20:33.523 --> 20:34.523
And a car just...

20:35.692 --> 20:37.903
It came out of nowhere.
It... Speeding, and...

20:41.907 --> 20:43.075
I'm sorry, I just...

20:44.159 --> 20:46.328
I froze in its path,
and your dad, he just...

20:47.246 --> 20:48.664
He pushed me out of the way.

20:52.501 --> 20:53.501
He saved my life.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.087
And...

20:59.007 --> 21:00.207
if he hadn't done what he did,

21:00.259 --> 21:02.579
there's no way that I would be here
right now. I know that.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.308
I am so sorry.

21:09.518 --> 21:11.603
There's nothing I can do
to ever repay him, but...

21:15.941 --> 21:17.581
But I would like to say a prayer for him.

21:21.530 --> 21:22.698
Maybe you'd like to join me?

21:33.542 --> 21:38.213
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

21:39.256 --> 21:44.636
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.723
Give us this day our daily bread...

21:49.057 --> 21:50.892
and forgive us for our trespasses...

21:52.686 --> 21:56.356
as we forgive those...
who trespass against us.

21:57.983 --> 22:01.445
Lead us not to temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

22:01.695 --> 22:07.367
For thine is the kingdom, the power,
the glory, forever and ever.

22:08.076 --> 22:09.076
Amen.

22:15.667 --> 22:19.212

22:23.675 --> 22:25.802
Guys, my dad saved that woman's life.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.181
A total stranger.

22:32.809 --> 22:34.561
And he sacrificed himself for her.

22:37.272 --> 22:39.274
That's an incredible thing, Archie.

22:40.525 --> 22:41.860
He died a hero.

22:42.527 --> 22:43.862
Why did he have to be one?

22:45.197 --> 22:47.532
Why this time?
Why c... Why did he have to stop?

22:47.616 --> 22:49.696
Why couldn't he have kept driving
like everyone else?

22:49.910 --> 22:51.745
Because your dad helped people.

22:54.122 --> 22:56.917
- That's just who he was.
- Yeah, and it got him killed.

22:59.920 --> 23:01.520
I mean, he died on the side of the road.

23:03.757 --> 23:06.551
Waiting for an ambulance,
without his family, without his friends.

23:08.261 --> 23:10.597
I'm sorry, but that's not heroic, that's...

23:11.932 --> 23:12.932
That's senseless.

23:13.141 --> 23:16.561
I promise you... that is not true.

23:19.356 --> 23:21.608
- Arch?
- I'm just going outside. Need some air.

23:46.842 --> 23:47.842
Archie?

23:48.009 --> 23:49.009
Yeah. Yes.

23:49.803 --> 23:51.555
- They found him.
- What?

23:52.264 --> 23:55.892
- The guy who killed my dad?
- Yeah, he turned himself in an hour ago.

23:56.351 --> 23:57.602
Who is he, Mr. Jones?

23:58.687 --> 24:01.898
His name's George Augustine.
He lives in Cherry Creek. No priors.

24:02.607 --> 24:04.568
- Is he in jail?
- No, he...

24:05.527 --> 24:08.238
- He made bail. He was released.
- What? He's out?

24:08.822 --> 24:11.032
He should be rotting in a cell, Mr. Jones.

24:11.324 --> 24:13.034
He will be, but this is how it works.

24:13.118 --> 24:16.454
And for what it's worth, the chief told me
the guy's real broken up about it, so...

24:16.663 --> 24:17.706
He killed my father.

24:18.039 --> 24:20.333
Your dad's gonna get justice,
I promise you.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.836
Yeah, you're right, he will get justice.
I promise you.

24:22.919 --> 24:24.045
Archie. Where are you?

25:11.384 --> 25:12.385
Yes, can I help you?

25:14.054 --> 25:17.140
- Are you George Augustine?
- Yes. What can I...?

25:18.975 --> 25:19.975
Fred Andrews.

25:20.393 --> 25:22.562
- Wha...? Wait.
- That's the man you killed.

25:24.105 --> 25:25.105
My father.

25:25.649 --> 25:26.649
Fred Andrews.

25:27.067 --> 25:29.402
You hit him with your car
and you kept driving.

25:29.611 --> 25:31.131
You left him there to die. You coward!

25:32.197 --> 25:33.198
S... Son, listen.

25:33.490 --> 25:36.201
- I was just...
- No! Shut up!

25:38.119 --> 25:40.497
You took away the only man
who can call me that.

25:42.332 --> 25:43.332
Why did you do it?

25:44.334 --> 25:45.334
Huh?

25:46.002 --> 25:50.298
Were you on your phone? Were you drunk?
What were you doing when you murdered him?

25:52.592 --> 25:53.592
Tell me.

25:54.302 --> 25:56.221
- Tell me or I swear I...
- Please, stop!

25:57.889 --> 25:58.889
He didn't do it.

26:00.392 --> 26:02.185
- What?
- He didn't do anything wrong.

26:02.769 --> 26:03.979
Jeffrey, get upstairs.

26:06.189 --> 26:07.589
What's he saying? What do you mean?

26:07.941 --> 26:09.192
He told the police he did it.

26:10.819 --> 26:12.570
To protect me, but it wasn't him.

26:13.697 --> 26:17.325
Okay, it wa... Yeah, it was me.
It was my fault.

26:19.035 --> 26:21.705
I took the car when I wasn't supposed to.
I... I... I...

26:23.581 --> 26:25.292
I... I don't even have my license.

26:30.588 --> 26:31.588
I'm sorry.

26:33.508 --> 26:34.551
I'm so sorry.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.202
- Archie.
- You had us really worried.

27:02.370 --> 27:03.370
You okay?

27:06.166 --> 27:07.292
How'd you know where I was?

27:09.002 --> 27:10.879
My dad called. He had a bad feeling.

27:12.422 --> 27:13.465
What happened?

27:15.050 --> 27:16.050
I...

27:18.803 --> 27:19.929
I came looking for...

27:23.808 --> 27:26.144
He's just this dumb kid.

27:26.603 --> 27:30.273
- Who is?
- The kid driving the car that hit my dad.

27:32.108 --> 27:33.108
He's just stupid.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.320
Terrified.

27:38.073 --> 27:40.075
That's something that I would have done.

27:42.619 --> 27:44.579
Taking the car out without permission.

27:45.080 --> 27:47.665
Hell, I did it a dozen times,
and his dad was...

27:50.335 --> 27:51.335
Was protecting him.

27:54.130 --> 27:55.340
The same way mine would have.

28:01.012 --> 28:03.866
I don't know what the hell I'm doing,
you guys. I can't believe I'm here.

28:03.890 --> 28:06.267
I can't believe I did this.

28:09.729 --> 28:10.855
I'm a terrible son.

28:20.031 --> 28:21.908
You're not a terrible son.

28:23.284 --> 28:26.079
I just went into a stranger's house
and almost hurt an innocent man.

28:27.330 --> 28:30.667
I think... your father would understand...

28:32.210 --> 28:33.545
under these circumstances.

28:33.920 --> 28:35.630
All we ever did was fight, Ronnie.

28:36.381 --> 28:38.383
I lied to him constantly.

28:40.760 --> 28:42.971
He would be ashamed of me.
I'm ashamed of me.

28:43.513 --> 28:45.348
Archie, listen to me.

28:48.351 --> 28:53.106
Your dad loved you... more than anyone
and anything else.

28:55.358 --> 29:00.405
Whenever he looked at you...
there was pride in his eyes.

29:01.781 --> 29:03.074
He was proud of you.

29:07.078 --> 29:09.038
- I don't know what to do.
- I do.

29:13.543 --> 29:14.543
Come here.

29:16.421 --> 29:17.901
You're gonna finish what you started.

29:20.633 --> 29:22.302
You're gonna bring your dad home.

29:26.306 --> 29:28.641
Okay.
The hearse is behind the funeral home,

29:29.058 --> 29:31.019
ready to go. Ronnie and I will take it.

29:31.603 --> 29:34.230
- You guys take my dad's truck back?
- Of course, Arch.

29:34.397 --> 29:36.065
Yeah. We'll just follow you guys.

29:38.026 --> 29:39.026
Thanks.

30:01.174 --> 30:04.302
- Everything all right, Mr. Jones?
- Everything's good, Red. I...

30:05.178 --> 30:07.722
I heard what you and Jug and the girls
were up to

30:07.806 --> 30:09.098
and I wanted to be a part of it.

30:10.975 --> 30:13.615
I'd like to give your dad a police escort
the rest of the way home,

30:13.686 --> 30:14.729
if you're okay with that.

30:15.355 --> 30:16.355
He deserves it.

30:19.859 --> 30:21.736
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

30:22.612 --> 30:23.738
- Follow me then?
- Yeah.

31:53.786 --> 31:56.039
- I couldn't leave him there, Mom.
- I know.

32:00.585 --> 32:01.585
I brought Dad home.

32:02.128 --> 32:03.128
You did.

32:04.672 --> 32:05.673
You sure did.

32:08.885 --> 32:10.219
I'm so proud of you.

32:12.055 --> 32:13.264
I know he would be, too.

And now... Fred's son, Archie,
would like to say a few words.

33:37.849 --> 33:41.310
Earlier, I was thinking...
on the drive over here...

33:43.438 --> 33:45.189
how much of Riverdale my dad built.

33:46.065 --> 33:47.442
Or just fixed up.

33:50.153 --> 33:53.281
Houses, office buildings.
A bit of everything.

33:57.243 --> 33:58.578
He helped build this town.

34:02.498 --> 34:05.501
And one day, if I'm lucky enough
to have a son or a daughter of my own...

34:08.420 --> 34:09.940
I'll be able to point to a building...

34:11.090 --> 34:12.800
or even just a brick in a building
and say:

34:14.594 --> 34:17.929
"Your grandpa made that...
with his hands."

34:23.478 --> 34:24.478
It's the Fourth of July.

34:27.440 --> 34:30.860
I remember this one Fourth...
it was raining.

34:33.112 --> 34:37.742
The fireworks show was canceled.
And I was so bummed,

34:37.824 --> 34:39.827
I remember sitting in the backyard
just balling...

34:42.163 --> 34:44.540
until my dad came home
with all these fireworks.

34:44.831 --> 34:47.293
I mean, enough to burn a house down.
You remember that, Mom?

34:52.799 --> 34:53.799
And...

34:56.761 --> 34:59.361
we lit them in the backyard.
It was just... It was the best night.

35:04.310 --> 35:06.110
My dad was there
for every high and every low.

35:09.774 --> 35:11.734
He's the greatest man I've ever known.

35:16.864 --> 35:18.664
It hurts me
that I never got to say goodbye...

35:22.954 --> 35:24.954
that I won't get to see him again
or talk to him...

35:31.337 --> 35:35.633
but his spirit and his memory lives on
in this town and in everyone he's met.

35:38.803 --> 35:40.763
Fred Andrews will always be a part
of Riverdale.

35:45.226 --> 35:46.435
I love you so much, Dad.

35:52.900 --> 35:55.403
- Excuse me. Mrs. Fisher?
- Oh.

35:56.279 --> 35:59.574
- Wonderful service, didn't you think?
- Yes. It was.

36:02.076 --> 36:05.156
- I'd like to discuss the payment with you.
- It's already been taken care of.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.123
By Mrs. Andrews?

36:07.290 --> 36:11.252
- I didn't want her paying for any of this.
- No, by your father.

36:11.627 --> 36:12.879
He paid the bill in full.

37:04.764 --> 37:07.433
How do you sum up the life
of a man like Fred Andrews?

37:08.351 --> 37:09.602
You could start with the facts.

37:10.394 --> 37:12.480
That he was born
at Riverdale General Hospital.

37:13.689 --> 37:16.734
That his parents
were Arthur and Virginia Andrews.

37:17.276 --> 37:19.237
That he led
the Riverdale High baseball team

37:19.320 --> 37:22.031
to two consecutive state championships.

37:22.949 --> 37:27.787
Took over the family business at 18,
got married, had a son, settled down.

37:28.162 --> 37:30.539
And while others were rushing
to get out of Riverdale,

37:30.623 --> 37:32.625
Fred was setting down roots.

37:33.793 --> 37:36.837
When our town saw a pariah
and closed its doors,

37:36.921 --> 37:40.549
Fred saw a lost soul and opened his.

37:41.300 --> 37:44.679
There was always room at his table,
in his home, for others.

37:47.181 --> 37:49.809
Whenever our town was under attack,
Fred was on the front line,

37:49.892 --> 37:51.560
fighting for it, defending it.

37:52.853 --> 37:55.690
He was our Good Samaritan,
our George Bailey,

37:55.940 --> 37:57.400
our knight in flannel armor.

37:57.483 --> 38:00.611
And by the way,
he was a hell of a good tipper.

38:01.070 --> 38:02.113
Damn right, he was.

38:02.863 --> 38:05.283
Fred left Riverdale better
than when he found it.

38:06.993 --> 38:08.995
That's his legacy.

38:16.210 --> 38:17.210
Mom.

38:18.713 --> 38:20.153
We're about to start. Are you ready?

You already are, Archie.

40:00.689 --> 40:01.689
No, not yet.

40:04.151 --> 40:05.151
But I'm gonna honor him.

40:08.447 --> 40:10.324
I'm gonna honor his memory every day.
