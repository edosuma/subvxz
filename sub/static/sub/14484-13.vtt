YOU WOULDN'T HAVE DONE

[ Weeping ]
HE'S A SAINT.

20:50.309 --> 20:53.378
BUT WHY DID YOU HAVE ALL
FIVE WEDDINGS ON THE SAME DAY?

20:53.448 --> 20:55.275
HEY, LADY, YOU GOT ANY IDEA
WHAT IT COSTS

20:55.344 --> 20:56.654
TO RENT A TUX
THAT CHANGES SHAPE?

ALL RIGHT, ALCAZAR.

20:58.172 --> 21:00.586
I JUST HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION
FOR YOU.

21:00.654 --> 21:01.550
WHAT'S THAT?

21:01.619 --> 21:03.205
IF YOU COULD CHANGE FORM

21:03.275 --> 21:06.067
WHY DIDN'T YOU CHANGE IT
IN THE ONEPLACE THAT COUNTS?

21:16.931 --> 21:19.481
THANKS FOR SAVING ME
FROM THAT CREEP, FRY.

21:19.550 --> 21:21.205
HEY, THAT'S WHAT I DO.

21:21.275 --> 21:24.067
I GUESS I WAS SO DESPERATE
TO FIND OUT WHO I REALLY WAS

21:24.136 --> 21:26.378
I FORGOT WHO I REALLY WAS.

21:26.448 --> 21:27.792
NO HARM DONE.

21:27.862 --> 21:30.103
IN THE MANY DECADES
YOU'LL WORK TO REPAY ME

21:30.172 --> 21:32.619
FOR THAT SHIPMENT OF POPCORN
YOU DESTROYED

21:32.689 --> 21:35.964
YOU'LL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME
TO SEARCH FOR YOUR TRUE HOME.

21:36.034 --> 21:37.205

I MEAN, HOW MANY PLANETS
CAN THERE BE?
