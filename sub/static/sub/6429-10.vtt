WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:04.000
That will take you directly

00:04.001 --> 00:05.767
to who has the sword, and that

00:06.234 --> 00:10.100
will lead you... to Macpherson.

00:10.167 --> 00:11.300
- Who?
- Who?

00:11.367 --> 00:12.701
I wasn't here when everything went down

00:12.767 --> 00:16.601
between Artie and Macpherson,
but I know it was bad.

00:16.667 --> 00:19.634
It's called the past rearing its ugly head.

00:19.701 --> 00:22.067
And someone out there
is running around using the... 

00:22.133 --> 00:23.667
That someone is Macpherson.

00:23.734 --> 00:25.000
He wanted more than the sword.

00:25.067 --> 00:27.300
He wanted to mess us up as a team.

00:27.367 --> 00:29.734
Now it's up to you to stop him.

00:31.467 --> 00:33.300
Hello, Arthur.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.834
Aah!

00:37.000 --> 00:43.074

00:48.934 --> 00:51.634
Done! I win! Ha ha ha ha!

00:51.701 --> 00:52.901
It's not a race.

00:52.968 --> 00:55.467
Ooh, said the tortoise to the hare.

00:55.534 --> 00:58.534
You know, in the story, the tortoise actually wins.

00:58.601 --> 00:59.868
It's a fairy tale.

00:59.934 --> 01:01.400
How is a turtle gonna beat a rabbit?

01:01.467 --> 01:04.167
It's not a fairy tale. It's a fable, a life lesson.

01:04.233 --> 01:05.968
Slow and steady wins the race.

01:06.033 --> 01:09.901
Okay, here's a life lesson: Pete fast, Pete win.

01:09.968 --> 01:11.100
You all finished?

01:11.167 --> 01:13.133
- Oh, hey, hey, Artie, Artie.
- Yeah.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.167
If you were making a bet, who's faster,

01:15.234 --> 01:16.501
a turtle or a rabbit?

01:16.567 --> 01:18.567
Yeah, you finished the report?

01:18.634 --> 01:20.400
Yeah. Who are these going to?

01:20.467 --> 01:21.868
Not Mrs. Frederic.

01:21.934 --> 01:24.000
Yeah, she doesn't seem like the paperwork type.

01:24.067 --> 01:26.100
No, these go above all our pay grades.

01:26.167 --> 01:27.334
Who?

01:27.400 --> 01:29.434
Myka, one day you will know

01:29.501 --> 01:32.501
all answers to all questions, just not today.

01:32.601 --> 01:34.701
Okay, fine. Enjoy your top secrets.

01:34.767 --> 01:36.701
I just got to go. I just can't
leave that courier waiting.

01:36.767 --> 01:38.167
What? A courier?

01:38.234 --> 01:39.834
What is this, the wells fargo wagon?

01:39.901 --> 01:41.734
Haven't you ever heard of email?

01:41.801 --> 01:43.434
No, no, no, that's not nearly secure enough,

01:43.501 --> 01:44.834
because we... it doesn't matter.

01:44.901 --> 01:46.300
You guys are having a day to yourselves, right?

01:46.367 --> 01:49.334
Have fun. Claudia's doing chores.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.033
- And I'll see you later.
- Doing chores where?

01:51.100 --> 01:52.434
Uh, in the warehouse.

01:52.501 --> 01:55.167
Scalpel.

01:55.234 --> 01:57.367
Thank you, nurse.

02:00.267 --> 02:02.567
There's an awful lot of blood.

02:02.634 --> 02:06.701
I think I need some suction.

02:08.100 --> 02:11.767
Ha ha! Ganza! Good as new.

02:11.834 --> 02:13.367
And get into the corners this time.

02:13.434 --> 02:15.767
Don't make me push you.

02:15.834 --> 02:19.267
Go on.

02:28.601 --> 02:31.000
Ew. Warm.

02:40.267 --> 02:43.000
Mmm. Ahh.

02:43.067 --> 02:46.968
Frosty goodness.

02:47.033 --> 02:49.400
What else?

02:49.467 --> 02:53.133
Okay, "repair auto-vac." Slice-o-pie.

02:53.200 --> 02:57.334
"Tighten and lubricate zip line."

02:57.400 --> 02:59.601
Sounds kind of dirty when you say it like that.

03:09.534 --> 03:12.467
God, ancient junk-oleum.

03:12.534 --> 03:14.734
You got to update this turd someday, Artie.

03:22.100 --> 03:24.334
Hey... 

03:24.400 --> 03:27.234
Be careful! Oh! Oh!

03:28.501 --> 03:30.467
No, no, no, no! Crap!

03:30.534 --> 03:34.067
Crappity, crap, crap, crap!

03:34.133 --> 03:37.000
Oh, my God! This is not good!

03:37.067 --> 03:40.200
This is not gonna look good on my report card!

03:40.267 --> 03:43.734
Oh, my God. Okay, don't panic.

03:43.801 --> 03:45.033
Oh, that's far.

03:45.100 --> 03:48.300
Oh, w.w.a.d.... what would Artie do?

03:48.367 --> 03:50.834
Um...

03:50.901 --> 03:52.434
Momentum! Got to get momentum.

03:52.501 --> 03:53.434
All right.

03:55.767 --> 03:57.434
Come on, momentum.

03:57.501 --> 03:58.801
Let's go!

04:07.901 --> 04:12.300
No, no, no, no, no, no. This sucks!

04:48.367 --> 04:50.667
So if it isn't Mrs. Frederic,

04:50.734 --> 04:52.701
then who's getting those reports?

04:52.767 --> 04:54.601
I don't know, Mr. Frederic?

04:54.667 --> 04:58.300
Claudia! I brought doughnuts.

05:01.400 --> 05:02.968
Doughnut.

05:03.033 --> 05:04.767
- Chocolate.
- Mmm.

05:13.267 --> 05:17.267
- What's "a.d."?
- Artifact disturbance.

05:17.334 --> 05:20.801
You know, you really need to read the manual.

05:39.868 --> 05:41.467
That can't be good.

05:41.534 --> 05:45.067
Claudia?

06:47.668 --> 06:50.067
Um, I'm sorry. I was just wondering... 

06:50.134 --> 06:52.467
I was hoping that you could
take a message to the higher-ups

06:52.534 --> 06:53.967
for me.

06:54.034 --> 06:55.867
This Macpherson situation... 

06:55.934 --> 06:57.900
I realize that they prefer
a hands-off approach but... 

06:57.967 --> 06:59.234
You're talking.

06:59.301 --> 07:00.900
- We don't talk.
- Oh.

07:00.967 --> 07:02.267
Well, I didn't think that was a rule.

07:02.334 --> 07:04.501
I just thought you weren't particularly social.

07:09.633 --> 07:11.967
I see I was right about that.

07:14.734 --> 07:16.967
Oh, God.

07:17.034 --> 07:18.067
Hi.

07:18.134 --> 07:19.834
She would like a word.

07:19.900 --> 07:21.800
I'm sure she would.

07:41.234 --> 07:43.434
Let's just follow the zip line.

07:43.500 --> 07:47.533
She's bound to turn up.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.767
I just hope she's okay, you know?

07:49.834 --> 07:51.468
Claudia's like bamboo.

07:51.533 --> 07:54.500
You can bend her all you want, but she'll never break.

07:54.567 --> 07:56.667
- This is hers.
- How do you know?

07:56.734 --> 07:59.667
We have to get rid of Artie's bedazzler.

07:59.734 --> 08:02.067
- Hello.
- Mmm.

08:09.468 --> 08:12.067
Is that a dodgeball?

08:12.134 --> 08:13.934
- How did that get in here?
- I don't... 

08:14.001 --> 08:16.401
Ooh! Oh, oh, oh...

08:16.468 --> 08:17.767
Hell, no.

08:17.834 --> 08:20.468
Um, d... d... did that just do what I think it did?

08:20.533 --> 08:21.600
Ow!

08:21.667 --> 08:23.201
- Yeah, yeah.
- Gosh.

08:23.267 --> 08:24.700
Is that thing having babies or...?

08:24.767 --> 08:26.301
Yeah. Look.

08:26.368 --> 08:28.267
- Okay, let's get out of here.
- Okay.

08:28.334 --> 08:29.834
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:29.900 --> 08:31.600
Those things... those things hit us

08:31.667 --> 08:33.034
every time we look away.

08:33.101 --> 08:34.700
Yeah, I'm... I'm gonna go with you on that,

08:34.767 --> 08:36.067
so I don't end up with a concussion.

08:36.134 --> 08:38.533
Um, ooh, uh, the screen.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.567
- What? Oh. Yes.
- Right?

08:40.633 --> 08:43.734
Let's... let's... let's read the screen.

08:43.799 --> 08:45.834
"Baylor dodgeball.

08:45.900 --> 08:49.734
Used for military dexterity and agility training.

08:49.800 --> 08:52.134
Multiplies upon contact." That we already know.

08:52.201 --> 08:55.767
"Acquired after the...

08:55.834 --> 08:59.500
bludgeoning deaths of five cadets in 1972."

08:59.567 --> 09:02.134
Uh, uh, bludgeoning is b... bad.

09:02.201 --> 09:04.167
Agreed. Agreed.

09:04.234 --> 09:07.267
Okay, there's a neutralizing station around the corner.

09:07.334 --> 09:09.600
- There... there should be.
- Ah, okay.

09:09.667 --> 09:13.700
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

09:13.767 --> 09:18.301
- Ready? On three.
- Okay.

09:18.368 --> 09:21.267
Three!

09:26.767 --> 09:28.700
Let's see how these puppies like

09:28.800 --> 09:30.401
a neutralizer flea bath.

09:30.468 --> 09:32.867
Ha ha!

09:32.934 --> 09:34.633
Errrrr!

09:34.700 --> 09:36.201
What... why isn't it working?

09:36.267 --> 09:38.201
Okay, this is bad.

09:38.267 --> 09:40.667
What's happening?

09:40.734 --> 09:42.767
- Why isn't it working?
- I don't know. It's busted.

09:42.834 --> 09:44.134
Okay, what do we do now?

09:44.201 --> 09:47.101
- Plan "b."
- What's... what's plan "b"?

09:47.167 --> 09:49.034
- I was hoping that you knew.
- No.

09:49.101 --> 09:51.167
Okay, wait. Uh...

09:51.234 --> 09:52.867
What's that one?

09:52.934 --> 09:54.134
"Breathe underwater."

09:54.201 --> 09:56.734
- "Hear colors."
- Okay, uh...

09:56.800 --> 09:59.434
- "Grow fingernails fast."
- "Summon locusts."

09:59.500 --> 10:01.734
Ugh. That's not...

10:04.067 --> 10:06.401
They're dodgeballs.

10:06.468 --> 10:08.567
Yes, yes, that's already established.

10:08.633 --> 10:10.267
That's how you win at dodgeball.

10:10.334 --> 10:11.267
You have to... you have to catch it.

10:11.334 --> 10:12.800
No, these are too fast.

10:12.867 --> 10:14.368
And what about that whole
"death by bludgeoning" thing?

10:14.434 --> 10:16.867
No, no, no, no, look. You look away, right?

10:16.934 --> 10:18.368
And when they go for you, I'll catch one.

10:18.434 --> 10:19.700
I think we should go with plan "c".

10:19.767 --> 10:21.001
What's plan "c"?

10:21.067 --> 10:22.267
Well, I run away, and you get pummeled.

10:22.334 --> 10:23.600
Look!

10:43.201 --> 10:44.867
Pete?

10:50.368 --> 10:51.468
Pete?

10:51.533 --> 10:53.700
Ha ha ha ha!

10:53.767 --> 10:56.368
- God!
- Ha ha ha ha!

10:59.934 --> 11:02.900
Who smells like tuna fish now, Ralph Brunsky?

11:02.967 --> 11:05.800
Who?

11:05.867 --> 11:07.234
Huh?

11:07.301 --> 11:07.368
Who?

11:08.633 --> 11:11.500
Oh, I was just... 

11:11.567 --> 11:14.034
Uh, I was having a little playground flashback.

11:14.101 --> 11:14.934
Ah.

11:17.301 --> 11:18.967
Hi, there. welcome to Ted's.

11:19.034 --> 11:20.900
I'm Theadora, but everybody calls me Ted.

11:20.967 --> 11:22.434
Party of one?

11:22.500 --> 11:25.967
Uh, no, no, I'm meeting
that woman right over there.

11:26.034 --> 11:28.267
And it's rarely a party.

11:30.800 --> 11:33.334
Hello.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.567
Oh, Arthur, have a seat.

11:35.633 --> 11:38.334
Uh, why are we meeting here?

11:38.401 --> 11:40.034
We need to have a chat.

11:40.101 --> 11:41.767
Pie of the day is banana cream.

11:41.834 --> 11:44.167
I highly recommend it. Made it myself.

11:44.234 --> 11:46.834
Uh, steak, bloody, black coffee,

11:46.900 --> 11:48.500
two pieces of the pie.

11:48.567 --> 11:53.001
Two? um... just a house salad.

11:53.067 --> 11:54.800
Leena's got me on a diet.

11:54.867 --> 11:59.633
Uh, maybe just one piece of that pie, please.

11:59.700 --> 12:01.334
She made it herself.

12:03.001 --> 12:04.600
How are things at the warehouse?

12:04.667 --> 12:06.201
They're good. They're fine.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.468
A little chaotic, but it's a good kind of chaos.

12:08.533 --> 12:09.934
And the missions?

12:10.001 --> 12:12.301
No one's been killed.

12:12.368 --> 12:13.500
You can't ask for more than that.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.834
And we have an excellent retrieval rate.

12:15.900 --> 12:19.334
What about the incidents in Paris

12:19.401 --> 12:22.234
or Las Vegas or Colorado?

12:22.301 --> 12:24.734
Mrs. Frederic, you know all about those.

12:24.800 --> 12:25.967
Why are you asking me about them?

12:26.034 --> 12:28.900
I'm forgetful. Refresh my memory.

12:28.967 --> 12:32.401
You were saying about Paris? 

12:36.734 --> 12:40.301
Claudia, there's half a doughnut in the office.

12:40.368 --> 12:42.301
How far do you think she could've gotten

12:42.368 --> 12:43.700
before the zip line snapped?

12:43.767 --> 12:45.267
Could be the other end of the warehouse.

12:45.334 --> 12:46.434
There's an end?

12:46.500 --> 12:48.034
I hope so.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.900
Duck and cover.

12:53.567 --> 12:55.468
Okay, that was bigger than usual.

13:00.267 --> 13:03.234
To hell with this.

13:03.301 --> 13:05.600
I'm gonna see if I can spot her from up here.

13:05.667 --> 13:08.234
Well, be careful.

13:14.167 --> 13:16.201
- Whoa.
- What is it?

13:16.267 --> 13:20.867
Go down the aisle, cross two over, and turn right.

13:28.134 --> 13:31.167
It's Leena's.

13:31.234 --> 13:34.767
But how?

13:34.834 --> 13:38.401
And there's a Claudia-shaped hole in the roof.

13:50.301 --> 13:52.900
- Claudia?

13:57.500 --> 13:58.800
- Are you here?
- Wait, you guys... 

13:58.867 --> 14:00.468
No, no, no, no, no, don't... don't close the...

14:00.533 --> 14:02.034
door.

14:02.101 --> 14:04.034
Thank God you're... we were following the zip line,

14:04.101 --> 14:05.234
and the... and the... 

14:05.301 --> 14:06.667
Yeah, no, I'm good.

14:06.734 --> 14:08.034
I mean, we're all trapped in here for eternity,

14:08.101 --> 14:09.834
but, uh, otherwise I'm solid.

14:09.900 --> 14:12.500
Okay...

14:12.600 --> 14:15.201
Well, let's just get back to the office,

14:15.267 --> 14:17.401
so we can fix the... 

14:17.468 --> 14:19.967
What?

14:20.034 --> 14:21.301
What?

15:07.301 --> 15:09.633
W... w... what the hell?

15:09.934 --> 15:11.634
This is what I've been saying.

15:27.167 --> 15:28.934
- First the goo doesn't work.
- Mm-hmm.

15:29.001 --> 15:31.834
Then one of those static balls tries to cook us.

15:31.900 --> 15:34.434
- Mm-hmm.
- And now a clingy house.

15:34.533 --> 15:36.700
The warehouse is in a bad mood today.

15:36.767 --> 15:39.867
Um, fyi, if anyone has to use the bathroom,

15:39.934 --> 15:41.434
don't flush.

15:41.533 --> 15:42.633
- Ooh.
- Trust me.

15:42.700 --> 15:44.101
Okay, you know what?

15:44.167 --> 15:46.034
Just... we just have to wait
and... and think about this

15:46.101 --> 15:48.067
for a second.

15:52.633 --> 15:54.567
New plan.

15:54.633 --> 15:57.368
Ooh, scoring that an 8.5.

15:57.434 --> 15:59.567
Next time you got to... umph... stick the landing.

15:59.633 --> 16:02.201
Let's all just...

16:02.267 --> 16:04.001
stop and think about this a second.

16:04.067 --> 16:05.334
That's a good plan.

16:05.401 --> 16:07.767
Claudia, did you try climbing back out

16:07.834 --> 16:09.034
of the same hole that you fell in?

16:09.101 --> 16:10.267
Yeah.

16:10.334 --> 16:12.067
Came right back in through the fireplace.

16:12.134 --> 16:14.334
I don't recommend it.

16:19.533 --> 16:21.468
- And you trust Pete and Myka?
- With my life.

16:21.533 --> 16:22.867
They're consummate professionals.

16:22.934 --> 16:24.401
Mrs. Frederic, I have to ask you,

16:24.468 --> 16:27.267
why, specific... excuse me.

16:27.334 --> 16:29.267
We're having a private... do you mind?

16:29.334 --> 16:31.434
Oh, no. That's all right.

16:39.401 --> 16:40.434
What is he... 

16:44.001 --> 16:46.967
Very sorry. Private party.

16:47.034 --> 16:48.934
Wait, what is... what is going on?

16:49.001 --> 16:50.633
I thought they would never leave.

16:50.700 --> 16:53.167
Okay, here we go. You be careful, now.

16:53.234 --> 16:54.500
This is a hot plate.

16:54.567 --> 16:57.600
I think we can begin.

17:00.967 --> 17:03.834
Mr. Valda.

17:03.900 --> 17:05.934
Hello, Irene.

17:06.001 --> 17:08.401
Mr. Valda, nice to see you again.

17:08.468 --> 17:09.532
This is Agent Nielsen.

17:09.599 --> 17:11.532
Just... just... just... just a minute.

17:11.599 --> 17:12.834
What is this?

17:12.900 --> 17:15.034
That's a house salad.

17:15.101 --> 17:16.900
Bering and Lattimer are consummate professionals.

17:16.967 --> 17:19.633
Thank you, Theadora.

17:19.700 --> 17:22.633
So as you stated in the past,

17:22.700 --> 17:24.401
Agents Bering and Lattimer's mission... 

17:24.468 --> 17:28.067
Do you mind telling me exactly what is happening here?

17:28.134 --> 17:31.134
Arthur, Mr. Valda's asking the questions.

17:31.201 --> 17:32.767
Please don't interrupt him.

17:32.834 --> 17:34.334
Yeah, well, I don't think I'm gonna be answering

17:34.401 --> 17:35.567
any questions

17:35.633 --> 17:37.001
until you tell me what this is about.

17:37.067 --> 17:41.001
Sometimes he forgets we answer to a higher authority.

17:41.067 --> 17:46.201
What higher authori...

17:46.267 --> 17:47.401
Ty?

17:56.567 --> 17:59.967
The regents. These are the regents?

18:00.034 --> 18:02.434
The regents meet here?

18:02.500 --> 18:04.368
They do today.

18:04.434 --> 18:06.767
You really expect me to believe that... 

18:06.834 --> 18:09.301
What exactly were you expecting, Agent Nielsen?

18:09.368 --> 18:12.267
Hooded, cloaked figures standing in half-light

18:12.334 --> 18:14.401
around a perpetually burning flame?

18:14.468 --> 18:16.700
He's seen too many movies.

18:16.767 --> 18:18.734
I... 

18:18.800 --> 18:21.368
You know, I just would have thought that... 

18:21.434 --> 18:22.834
This waitress is a regent?

18:22.900 --> 18:25.267
John Adams was a farmer.

18:25.334 --> 18:27.567
Abraham Lincoln was a small-town lawyer.

18:27.633 --> 18:30.468
Plato, socrates were teachers.

18:30.533 --> 18:32.734
Jesus was a carpenter.

18:32.800 --> 18:35.867
To equate judgment

18:35.934 --> 18:38.234
and wisdom with occupation

18:38.301 --> 18:41.134
is at best...

18:41.201 --> 18:42.500
insulting.

18:42.567 --> 18:46.201
Yeah, that's not... w... what I meant... 

18:46.267 --> 18:48.267
I know what you meant.

18:48.334 --> 18:50.934
Who would you have control the warehouse?

18:51.001 --> 18:55.201
Kings? Popes? Politicians?

18:55.267 --> 18:57.301
There'd be nothing left of it.

18:57.368 --> 18:58.800
No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

18:58.867 --> 19:00.368
I'm really sorry.

19:00.434 --> 19:03.834
- It's just, I didn't think... 
- Yes.

19:03.900 --> 19:05.900
That's one of the reasons
we needed to speak with you.

19:05.967 --> 19:10.800
Your reluctance to think.

19:10.867 --> 19:12.967
- Irene...
- Mrs. Frederic.

19:13.034 --> 19:15.567
Thank you, Theadora.

19:15.633 --> 19:20.067
So as I was saying, you stated in the past

19:20.134 --> 19:22.834
that agents Bering and Lattimer's mission

19:22.900 --> 19:25.368
was to snag it, bag it, and tag it.

19:25.434 --> 19:26.600
Correct?

19:26.667 --> 19:28.267
Yeah, well, you know, I mean, I... I said that.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.368
I didn't mean to denigrate the job description.

19:30.434 --> 19:33.234
Yet, in their brief tenure as field agents,

19:33.301 --> 19:35.867
they managed to destroy James Braid's chair... 

19:35.934 --> 19:37.401
If you just let me explain... 

19:37.468 --> 19:39.600
- Lewis Carroll's mirror.
- That wasn't destroyed.

19:39.667 --> 19:42.334
Your agents released a malevolent entity

19:42.401 --> 19:43.900
into the warehouse,

19:43.967 --> 19:46.600
allowing it access to dangerous artifacts.

19:46.667 --> 19:49.267
An accident. It was a total accident.

19:49.334 --> 19:52.667
It is not uncommon for artifacts
to be occasionally destroyed

19:52.734 --> 19:54.434
for the greater good.

19:54.500 --> 19:55.567
And agents Lattimer and Bering, I mean,

19:55.633 --> 19:57.101
they've repeatedly shown bravery.

19:57.167 --> 19:58.034
They've shown quick thinking.
They're an excellent team.

19:58.101 --> 19:59.934
They're probably the best agents

20:00.001 --> 20:01.468
- that the warehouse has ever had.
- Arthur!

20:01.567 --> 20:04.800
Their abilities are not in question here.

20:04.867 --> 20:07.434
Oh.

20:13.533 --> 20:14.800
This is about me?

20:14.867 --> 20:17.734
Not only you.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.600
Your former partner.

20:19.667 --> 20:23.468
Macpherson?

20:26.500 --> 20:28.800
Okay, okay, so this version of the b&b

20:28.867 --> 20:30.967
is in the warehouse because...

20:31.034 --> 20:32.500
Iit's an artifact.

20:32.567 --> 20:34.967
Oh, can this whole place be an artifact?

20:35.034 --> 20:36.267
Like, is that even possible?

20:36.334 --> 20:39.067
Yeah, pretty much anything is possible.

20:39.134 --> 20:41.967
So... so maybe there was
an artifact in the original

20:42.034 --> 20:43.734
that they couldn't take out, right?

20:43.800 --> 20:46.633
So... so they just moved the whole thing.

20:46.700 --> 20:49.434
And rebuilt the new one without it.

20:49.500 --> 20:53.134
Look for anything here
that's different from our b&b.

20:53.201 --> 20:55.600
All right! That was kind of cool.

20:55.667 --> 20:57.267
We had this little, like, group-think thing going on.

20:57.334 --> 20:58.533
Gold stars all around.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.001
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey!

21:00.101 --> 21:02.067
I do not recognize that chair.

21:02.134 --> 21:03.500
You were sleeping in it last week.

21:03.567 --> 21:05.767
What about this ugly lamp?

21:05.834 --> 21:08.734
Those lightbulbs burnt out a month ago,

21:08.800 --> 21:11.134
but this... this is new...

21:11.201 --> 21:13.301
or old.

21:17.434 --> 21:19.500
It's fused to the wall. This is it.

21:19.567 --> 21:20.900
Huh.

21:20.967 --> 21:24.067
It's a painting of this room.

21:24.134 --> 21:25.934
And we can't leave this room.

21:26.001 --> 21:27.934
Seems like quite the coinky-dink, don't you think?

21:28.001 --> 21:30.167
Yeah, how very Salvador Dali.

21:30.234 --> 21:31.900
Do you think this painting's keeping us here?

21:31.967 --> 21:35.134
Maybe. Pete, look at the lamp.

21:35.201 --> 21:36.533
What?

21:36.600 --> 21:39.101
Okay, now look at the painting.

21:39.167 --> 21:41.401
Claudia put it back in a different spot.

21:41.468 --> 21:41.533
It changed

21:42.967 --> 21:45.867
because of what you did.

21:45.934 --> 21:48.134
Okay, okay, so maybe

21:48.201 --> 21:51.167
if I do something to the picture...

21:57.368 --> 21:59.368
that happens.

21:59.434 --> 22:01.700
Sick!

22:09.401 --> 22:11.633
Oh...

22:11.700 --> 22:14.101
After you.

22:14.167 --> 22:17.201
Okay. Your turn.

22:17.267 --> 22:18.967
Don't mind if I do.

22:19.034 --> 22:21.368
Don't even bother.

22:21.434 --> 22:23.967
At least that was new.

22:24.034 --> 22:27.034
Oh, man. you know what? This thing is useless!

22:27.101 --> 22:29.800
Did I do that?

22:29.867 --> 22:32.633
Well, neither of us did.

22:43.767 --> 22:45.234
I can see the warehouse.

22:45.301 --> 22:48.468
Okay, um, there's... there's, uh, a letter opener,

22:48.567 --> 22:49.967
if I remember...

22:50.034 --> 22:51.800
Yes! Um, okay.

22:56.967 --> 22:58.167
Okay.

23:03.301 --> 23:06.967
Let's go.

23:07.034 --> 23:08.334
Oh.

23:08.401 --> 23:11.468
All right, safe and sound.

23:13.533 --> 23:16.667
- What?
- That.

23:16.734 --> 23:19.468
Maybe we should have stayed inside.

23:36.234 --> 23:37.867
We need to get back to the office.

23:37.934 --> 23:40.134
Oh, no need.

23:40.201 --> 23:41.867
"What are you doing wasting time
installing backup terminals

23:41.934 --> 23:43.867
in the aisle, foolish red-haired girl?"

23:43.934 --> 23:45.534
'Cause you never know when you might need one, Artie.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.268
- Nice.
- Hey-o.

23:47.333 --> 23:50.500
Okay, looks like the problem is in the gooery.

23:50.567 --> 23:52.400
What's a gooery?

23:52.467 --> 23:53.634
I'm guessing it's Claudia-speak

23:53.700 --> 23:54.767
for the neutralizer processing center.

23:54.834 --> 23:56.700
- Uh-huh.
- Right. Of course.

23:56.767 --> 23:59.067
Well, it's chapter 197 in the manual.

23:59.134 --> 24:01.168
It's 1,000 pages long. I'll wait for the movie.

24:01.234 --> 24:03.034
Okay, the neutralizer processing center

24:03.101 --> 24:04.734
is what pumps the purple goo

24:04.801 --> 24:06.867
through the warehouse,
creating a stability field.

24:06.934 --> 24:08.367
Yeah, it's like all the gak in here

24:08.433 --> 24:09.767
are nuclear rods, right?

24:09.867 --> 24:11.001
As long as there's coolant, it's all good.

24:11.067 --> 24:12.001
The gooery jakes out the coolant.

24:12.067 --> 24:13.333
It keeps the artifacts

24:13.400 --> 24:16.101
from getting all artifacty on their own.

24:16.168 --> 24:18.867
Okay, so the gooery... cool name, by the way... 

24:18.934 --> 24:20.400
Uh, needs to go back online.

24:20.467 --> 24:21.400
Man with a plan.

24:25.234 --> 24:27.700
Okay, so does chapter 198 say what happens

24:27.767 --> 24:29.467
if we don't get it working again?

24:29.534 --> 24:31.300
The same thing that happens to the nuclear rods

24:31.367 --> 24:33.034
without the coolant, except probably worse.

24:33.101 --> 24:34.333
Yeah, I'm guessing when we get to 100%,

24:34.400 --> 24:35.767
we have China syndrome.

24:35.834 --> 24:37.667
We've got maybe... maybe half an hour left.

24:37.734 --> 24:39.567
- What's the fastest way there?
- Let me see.

24:39.634 --> 24:42.134
We got to go through aisle Haddonfield-79,

24:42.201 --> 24:43.567
then loop around Carlsbad-22.

24:43.634 --> 24:44.634
No, no, no, no, why... why don't we just go

24:44.700 --> 24:45.934
straight through here?

24:46.001 --> 24:47.067
'Cause that's the dark vault.

24:47.134 --> 24:48.333
Ooh.

24:48.400 --> 24:49.700
Okay.

24:49.767 --> 24:52.934
See, I know what that is.
Didn't read the manual.

24:53.001 --> 24:55.067
That's where all the dangerous stuff is.

24:55.134 --> 24:57.134
Yeah, like, mega-dangerous, dude. Mondo.

24:57.201 --> 24:59.467
Okay, okay, but we still... we can't loop around.

24:59.534 --> 25:01.101
- I say we take the risk.
- I agree.

25:01.168 --> 25:03.201
- it's not often that I agree,
but I agree.

25:03.268 --> 25:04.667
Guys, if we're gonna do this thing,

25:04.734 --> 25:06.367
let's do this thing.

25:06.433 --> 25:08.700
Wait, oh, no, no, no, no.

25:08.767 --> 25:10.700
You're not going anywhere,
Claudia. You're gonna stay put.

25:10.767 --> 25:13.201
- I'm coming with.
- No, no. We're the agents.

25:13.268 --> 25:15.067
We're the ones that agreed to risk our lives, not you.

25:15.134 --> 25:17.034
Yeah, but this is my home too.
You might need my help.

25:17.101 --> 25:19.667
She's right. She has read the manual.

25:19.734 --> 25:21.467
Am I never gonna hear the end of that?

25:21.534 --> 25:23.001
She knows this place, okay?

25:23.067 --> 25:27.734
- I say that she comes with.
- Please?

25:27.801 --> 25:29.134
Okay, fine, but you stick close.

25:29.201 --> 25:31.467
- And you do exactly as we say.
- All right.

25:31.534 --> 25:33.067
Suicide mission with the team.

25:33.134 --> 25:35.801
Kind of exciting. I'm excited. Come on!

25:41.967 --> 25:44.567
And in attempting to save Joshua Donovan,

25:44.634 --> 25:48.634
you placed his sister... yet another civilian... in danger.

25:48.700 --> 25:50.234
I'm sorry. Excuse me, please.

25:50.333 --> 25:52.067
If this is about Macpherson,
then why am I being asked

25:52.134 --> 25:54.500
about cases that have absolutely
nothing to do with Macpherson?

25:54.567 --> 25:57.433
Agent Nielsen, I will ask the questions.

25:57.500 --> 26:01.067
It might be wise to let this run its course for now.

26:01.134 --> 26:02.967
All right, fine. Fine.

26:03.034 --> 26:05.201
Ye... yes. Yes.

26:05.268 --> 26:09.067
In saving Joshua, I maybe put Claudia in da... 

26:09.134 --> 26:10.767
a little danger.

26:10.834 --> 26:12.934
- But I promised her that if... 
- You promised?

26:13.001 --> 26:15.433
You promised?

26:15.500 --> 26:17.034
Sounds as if personal feelings

26:17.101 --> 26:19.801
became involved in professional judgment.

26:19.867 --> 26:21.300
This has been an issue in the past, has it not?

26:21.400 --> 26:23.367
It may have come up.

26:23.433 --> 26:25.901
But his artifact-retrieval rate is excellent.

26:25.967 --> 26:28.034
- It's the highest in years.
- Thank you.

26:28.101 --> 26:29.067
Simply the facts.

26:29.134 --> 26:29.201
Very well, then.

26:31.400 --> 26:34.367
The facts.

26:34.433 --> 26:36.367
Thank you, Theadora.

26:36.433 --> 26:39.333
Did you or did you not on two separate occasions

26:39.400 --> 26:42.667
involve Daniel Dickinson,

26:42.734 --> 26:46.067
a high-ranking secret service officer,

26:46.134 --> 26:49.101
in warehouse 13 matters,

26:49.168 --> 26:52.168
all of which were classified at the highest level?

26:52.234 --> 26:54.634
Yes.

26:54.700 --> 26:57.333
We have a unique relationship

26:57.400 --> 26:58.767
with the united states government... 

26:58.834 --> 27:02.700
a relationship that your actions have now complicated.

27:02.767 --> 27:05.500
I contacted a fellow government official

27:05.567 --> 27:08.734
in the normal course of performing my job,

27:08.801 --> 27:12.801
a job to which I have dedicated
the last 40 years of my life.

27:12.867 --> 27:15.134
No one's questioning your dedication, Arthur.

27:15.201 --> 27:17.700
What we are questioning, Agent Nielsen,

27:17.767 --> 27:21.801
is your future.

27:23.500 --> 27:25.400
Oh, it's sealed with an omega level security code.

27:25.467 --> 27:26.767
Can you hack it?

27:26.834 --> 27:30.600
Pope, catholic. Bear, woods. You know the drill.

27:30.667 --> 27:32.734
And...

27:32.801 --> 27:34.567
Done.

27:46.433 --> 27:50.168
Man, this place is creep-tastic.

27:55.268 --> 27:58.168
Okay, don't... don't look. Don't touch.

27:58.234 --> 28:00.034
Just keep moving.

28:05.001 --> 28:07.101
These objects are so dangerous

28:07.168 --> 28:09.967
they can only be controlled
by purple containment fields.

28:15.268 --> 28:16.500
Why are the neutralizer systems

28:16.567 --> 28:17.634
still working in here?

28:17.700 --> 28:18.934
Backup generators,

28:19.001 --> 28:20.567
'cause everything's so dangerous.

28:20.634 --> 28:23.467
Don't worry, they should hold up long enough

28:23.534 --> 28:25.801
for us to...

28:25.867 --> 28:29.634
Realize my karma sucks.

28:29.700 --> 28:33.134
We're starting to lose them.
Just... just keep moving.

28:36.734 --> 28:39.001
Oh, this is gonna take me a minute.

28:39.067 --> 28:40.367
Is it a different code?

28:40.433 --> 28:42.467
Yeah, I got to use an ftl-ascii binary algorithm.

28:42.534 --> 28:45.201
Hey, little guy. What you in for?

28:45.268 --> 28:48.734
Almost there. Hang in there, guys.

29:03.700 --> 29:05.034
And...

29:05.101 --> 29:06.201
We're good.

29:06.268 --> 29:08.034
Okay, let's go.

29:10.734 --> 29:14.700
Pete? Pete?

29:14.767 --> 29:17.067
Pete?

29:17.134 --> 29:18.400
Pete, what are you... 

29:18.467 --> 29:19.734
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

29:19.801 --> 29:21.567
- Pete!
- Crap!

29:21.634 --> 29:22.634
- Pete!
- Pete, what are you doing?

29:37.501 --> 29:39.300
Pete, can you hear me?

29:39.367 --> 29:42.000
Pete, are you okay?

29:42.067 --> 29:43.701
Pete!

29:43.834 --> 29:46.134
Pete, are you okay?

29:46.200 --> 29:48.734
Attention, warehouse agents.

29:48.801 --> 29:52.434
Mrs. Frederic. Thank God.

29:52.501 --> 29:55.134
Emergency evacuation required.

29:55.200 --> 30:00.000
Repeat, emergency evacuation required.

30:00.067 --> 30:04.134
Mrs. F, we're down here.

30:04.200 --> 30:06.933
Energy levels approaching critical mass.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.067
That's a recording.

30:08.134 --> 30:09.501
- Ohh...
- Yeah.

30:09.567 --> 30:11.834
Emergency evacuation required.

30:11.900 --> 30:13.267
That's the most I've ever heard her say.

30:13.334 --> 30:14.534
I know.

30:14.601 --> 30:16.167
Well, this is a whole nother code level.

30:16.234 --> 30:17.801
It's gonna take me a few minutes.

30:17.868 --> 30:20.401
You know what? Step aside.

30:20.467 --> 30:21.667
Just stand over there.

30:21.734 --> 30:25.801
Emergency evacuation required.

30:25.868 --> 30:27.567
Whoa!

30:29.267 --> 30:31.701
Okay, that was flat-out awesome.

30:31.768 --> 30:33.567
Pete, what are you doing, man? We got to go.

30:33.634 --> 30:35.300
Wait! Wait! Stop, stop, stop!

30:35.367 --> 30:36.900
The circle... 

30:36.967 --> 30:38.601
I think it's there for a reason.

30:38.667 --> 30:40.933
Right?

30:41.000 --> 30:44.601
Pete, what you doing?

30:44.667 --> 30:48.234
Oh, nothing.

30:48.300 --> 30:51.234
He's looking at a typewriter.

30:51.300 --> 30:53.100
It's not just any typewriter.

30:53.167 --> 30:55.300
It's, um, Sylvia Plath's.

30:55.367 --> 30:57.334
she wrote this poem called Ennui,

30:57.401 --> 30:59.567
and ultimately she took her own life in a... 

30:59.634 --> 31:03.234
Myka, I spent some serious time in the bell jar.

31:03.300 --> 31:04.868
I know who Sylvia Plath is.

31:04.933 --> 31:06.467
Right.

31:06.534 --> 31:08.300
What's that thing doing to him?

31:11.501 --> 31:13.834
It's sucking the life out of him.

31:15.734 --> 31:18.467
We have to get him out
of the containment field.

31:18.534 --> 31:20.933
Pete?

31:21.000 --> 31:22.768
Pete, can you come here?

31:22.834 --> 31:24.933
Why?

31:25.000 --> 31:26.367
What's the point?

31:26.434 --> 31:29.033
What do we do?

31:29.100 --> 31:32.200
There's no time.

31:32.267 --> 31:35.534
Okay, you go up to the gooery, get it online.

31:35.601 --> 31:37.434
I'll stay here and deal with this.

31:37.501 --> 31:40.300
What, like, just on my own or...?

31:40.367 --> 31:41.567
Yeah.

31:41.634 --> 31:44.134
Claudia, you know this warehouse, okay?

31:44.200 --> 31:45.768
I... I trust you.

31:45.834 --> 31:48.300
Right. Yeah. No, I'll just... 

31:48.367 --> 31:49.467
- Go.
- I'll do it, then.

31:49.534 --> 31:51.768
Get going. Tick tock.

31:55.067 --> 31:56.300
I have a few more questions.

31:56.367 --> 31:58.167
Do you? Really?

31:58.234 --> 32:00.768
Yeah, I... I have a few of my own.

32:00.834 --> 32:02.000
Arthur, don't do anything foolish.

32:02.067 --> 32:04.501
This exercise is a pointless

32:04.567 --> 32:07.067
and insulting waste of time.

32:07.134 --> 32:09.267
I asked you not to do this.

32:09.334 --> 32:11.033
If Macpherson is out there... 

32:11.100 --> 32:12.768
What? If? I... if? If?

32:12.834 --> 32:14.167
I have a wound right here... 

32:14.234 --> 32:16.000
right here in my shoulder that should prove it.

32:16.067 --> 32:17.634
He's out there. Oh, he's out there.

32:17.701 --> 32:19.100
And he's planning something far worse

32:19.167 --> 32:20.334
than any of you can imagine.

32:20.401 --> 32:21.801
What are you doing about it?

32:21.868 --> 32:24.067
What are you doing? You're tying my hands!

32:24.134 --> 32:26.534
You leave us no choice.

32:26.601 --> 32:28.367
You say Macpherson is a threat.

32:28.434 --> 32:29.701
And you use that

32:29.768 --> 32:33.933
to justify violating warehouse protocol

32:34.000 --> 32:36.100
time and time again.

32:36.167 --> 32:39.601
Pretty soon, y... you're gonna be
making up your own rules

32:39.667 --> 32:42.134
just to sanction your actions.

32:42.200 --> 32:44.567
Does that sound familiar, Agent Nielsen, huh?

32:44.634 --> 32:47.567
Sound like someone we both knew?

32:47.634 --> 32:49.933
Mr. Valda, he knows the rules.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.967
He knows that I'm forced to follow them.

32:53.033 --> 32:54.300
Don't you see that?

32:54.367 --> 32:56.768
And if I'm gonna take Macpherson... and I am... 

32:56.834 --> 32:59.167
then rules have to be broken.

32:59.234 --> 33:00.567
That's the only thing
that'll work.

33:00.634 --> 33:01.734
You know what's not gonna work?

33:01.801 --> 33:03.200
Reining in the one person

33:03.267 --> 33:04.801
that can stop him before it's too late.

33:04.868 --> 33:07.701
Look at all of you. You're not out in the field!

33:07.768 --> 33:10.434
You're here, hiding in plain sight.

33:10.501 --> 33:12.434
What are you doing? You're judging me.

33:12.501 --> 33:15.200
You're judging my methods, because... 

33:19.467 --> 33:22.134
you're af... afraid of him.

33:26.634 --> 33:28.401
- Tell me I'm wrong.
- Arthur...

33:28.467 --> 33:31.768
No, no, no, no, no. Mr. Valda, look at me.

33:31.834 --> 33:34.200
You tell me right to my face... tell me I'm wrong.

33:34.267 --> 33:37.134
Yeah, well...

33:37.200 --> 33:40.000
either fire me or kill me

33:40.067 --> 33:41.933
or let me do my job.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.367
You better make a decision,
and you better make it fast

33:45.434 --> 33:47.434
before he makes it for you.

33:52.734 --> 33:55.967
I believe the ball is in your court.

33:59.334 --> 34:00.667
Okay, Pete, we're running out of time here,

34:00.734 --> 34:03.267
so...

34:03.334 --> 34:05.067
Okay, look, what I'm gonna do,

34:05.134 --> 34:06.967
I'm gonna take off my belt, all right?

34:07.033 --> 34:08.534
I'm gonna throw it to you.

34:08.601 --> 34:11.534
You grab it, and I'll pull you
out of there, okay, Pete?

34:11.601 --> 34:14.266
Whatever.

34:14.333 --> 34:17.199
Okay, grab the belt.

34:17.266 --> 34:18.868
Pete, grab the belt.

34:18.933 --> 34:21.333
Pete, grab it. Grab the belt!

34:21.400 --> 34:22.067
Okay.

34:22.134 --> 34:24.300
You're a rabbit, right?

34:24.367 --> 34:26.933
Pete, you're not a tortoise, so win, win the race.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.467
Just... just grab it.

34:28.534 --> 34:30.933
Win, lose... 

34:31.000 --> 34:32.367
what's the diff?

34:32.434 --> 34:35.434
Okay. 

34:35.501 --> 34:38.933
Warehouse, give me something.

34:39.000 --> 34:42.833
Give me something...

34:42.900 --> 34:45.234
Thank you.

34:49.167 --> 34:51.400
Okay.
Pete.

34:51.467 --> 34:52.667
Oh! 

34:52.734 --> 34:55.000
Aah! You again.

34:55.067 --> 34:57.367
Are you okay?

34:57.434 --> 34:58.701
Yeah. What was that?

34:58.768 --> 35:00.900
Okay, listen, we're running out of time.

35:00.967 --> 35:02.634
The warehouse is about to explode.

35:02.701 --> 35:04.167
Okay, so just... come on.

35:22.567 --> 35:26.601
Critical mass in five minutes.

35:26.667 --> 35:29.167
Critical mass in five minutes.

35:29.234 --> 35:33.701
Really? Cliche much?

35:44.067 --> 35:46.134
Ew.

35:46.200 --> 35:47.501
Gross.

35:47.567 --> 35:49.801
Oh.

35:56.234 --> 35:58.634
Ew. Uhh.

35:58.701 --> 36:00.667
Well, it's not so bad.

36:00.734 --> 36:02.367
It kind of smells like chicken.

36:02.434 --> 36:05.967
Critical mass in four minutes.

36:06.033 --> 36:07.234
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

36:07.300 --> 36:09.401
I'm just a little drained, that's all.

36:09.467 --> 36:11.334
You go. Go ahead. I'll... I'll catch up.

36:11.401 --> 36:13.000
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah. You go.

36:13.067 --> 36:14.100
- Okay.
- Go.

36:14.167 --> 36:16.434
Myka.

36:16.501 --> 36:17.734
Yeah?

36:17.801 --> 36:19.167
Thank you.

36:29.501 --> 36:33.000
Okay, ugly, I'm just gonna pull you out.

36:33.067 --> 36:35.834
Oh, this is slippery.

36:35.900 --> 36:37.434
Okay.

36:37.501 --> 36:37.567
Gloves are coming off.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.134
Oh.

36:44.200 --> 36:45.234
Yeah.

36:48.501 --> 36:49.933
Eesh!

36:50.000 --> 36:54.434
Now I want italian food.

36:56.334 --> 36:59.801
No, no.

37:01.033 --> 37:02.933
Not the plan. Nope.

37:05.868 --> 37:07.834
Critical mass in three minutes.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.667
- Claudia?
- Myka!

37:19.734 --> 37:21.334
Hey, I know it looks like
I'm having a bunch of fun,

37:21.401 --> 37:22.401
but help!

37:22.467 --> 37:24.701
Almost there.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.033
- No, no, no. Don't touch.
- What?

37:28.100 --> 37:29.300
Way too sticky.

37:29.367 --> 37:30.900
No point in us both getting ground up.

37:30.967 --> 37:32.434
Okay.

37:32.501 --> 37:34.267
What is this stuff?

37:34.334 --> 37:35.567
If I remember properly,

37:35.634 --> 37:37.000
it's hours of fun for the whole family.

37:37.067 --> 37:40.434
- Okay.
- Aah!

37:40.501 --> 37:42.334
Oh!

37:42.401 --> 37:43.801
No!

37:43.868 --> 37:46.734
Oh, they lied. It's not even minutes of fun, really.

37:46.801 --> 37:48.434
Where's Pete? Still bored out of his mind?

37:48.501 --> 37:49.834
No, he'll be here in a minute.

37:49.933 --> 37:51.701
Just keep pulling.

37:56.367 --> 37:58.467
Critical mass in two minutes.

37:58.534 --> 38:00.000
Mind if I yell? I'm gonna yell.

38:00.067 --> 38:01.667
- Pete!
- Critical mass in two minutes.

38:01.734 --> 38:03.534
Pete, help!

38:05.267 --> 38:06.667
Pete!

38:06.734 --> 38:08.234
Chicks!

38:08.300 --> 38:11.234
Pete, hey, you have to find
something to cut this stuff!

38:11.300 --> 38:13.167
By "stuff," you don't mean our arms, right?

38:13.234 --> 38:14.834
- No. Don't touch it!
- Don't touch it!

38:14.900 --> 38:17.667
- It's sticky.
- Attention, warehouse agents,

38:17.734 --> 38:20.734
energy levels are now at omega level.

38:20.801 --> 38:24.467
- Critical mass in one minute.
- We're boned.

38:24.534 --> 38:26.167
How much time did she just say?

38:26.234 --> 38:27.434
50 seconds.

38:27.501 --> 38:30.100
See? See? Even on tape, she still... 

38:30.167 --> 38:32.100
Pete, just please go find something!

38:32.167 --> 38:33.634
- Okay, okay, I'm gonna go look.
- Wait. My tool belt.

38:33.701 --> 38:35.634
- What?
- Right there.

38:35.701 --> 38:37.534
- Get the snow globe.
- Okay.

38:37.601 --> 38:38.868
Ha! I got it.

38:38.933 --> 38:40.701
Hey, hey, hey.

38:40.768 --> 38:41.967
Use it to freeze the gears.

38:42.033 --> 38:44.567
- Pete!
- Oh, oh!

38:44.634 --> 38:45.933
I got a better idea. Hold on!

38:46.000 --> 38:47.300
- Hold on. Hold on.
- 30 seconds.

38:47.367 --> 38:50.000
All right, you guys got to pull really hard.

38:50.067 --> 38:53.367
- Yes!
- Right...

38:53.434 --> 38:55.234
Now!

39:09.734 --> 39:12.401
Attention, warehouse agents,

39:12.467 --> 39:14.300
emergency abated.

39:14.367 --> 39:16.667
- Nice work.
- Thank you.

39:21.534 --> 39:25.100
God, this is a weird job.

39:37.267 --> 39:39.467
Oh. God.

39:39.534 --> 39:43.033
How do you do that?

39:43.100 --> 39:46.467
That was quite a performance.

39:46.534 --> 39:48.467
Sounded better in my head.

39:50.734 --> 39:52.100
So am I fired?

39:52.167 --> 39:55.900
Worse. They want you to stay.

39:55.967 --> 39:59.134
Bering and Lattimer are not
the best agents we've ever had.

39:59.200 --> 40:00.834
- You are.
- They said that?

40:00.900 --> 40:03.167
It was said.

40:03.234 --> 40:05.434
And they were smart enough to believe me.

40:05.501 --> 40:07.734
Oh.

40:07.801 --> 40:09.933
Thanks.

40:10.000 --> 40:13.100
Simply the fact.

40:13.167 --> 40:16.300
What about Macpherson?

40:16.367 --> 40:19.967
Good hunting. Try not to get yourself killed.

40:39.868 --> 40:41.234
No, no, no.

40:41.300 --> 40:42.967
Don't try to be all friendly with me now.

40:46.734 --> 40:49.667
- Um, uh, hey, Myka?
- Yeah?

40:49.734 --> 40:52.801
I just wanted to say thanks for, um,

40:52.868 --> 40:55.000
you know, trusting me before.

40:55.067 --> 40:59.100
Claudia, I...

40:59.167 --> 41:00.734
I know what it's like to be your age

41:00.801 --> 41:02.334
and have no one believe in you.

41:02.401 --> 41:03.734
Yeah.

41:03.801 --> 41:06.000
You're good.

41:06.067 --> 41:08.267
No, you're really good.

41:08.334 --> 41:09.933
You'll be fine.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.167
Thanks.

41:12.234 --> 41:13.967
Hey, um, you know, if you're not busy later,

41:14.033 --> 41:15.167
maybe you could show me

41:15.234 --> 41:17.033
how to do that... ka-cha... kick thing,

41:17.100 --> 41:18.967
'cause, like, I tried it on a light switch,

41:19.033 --> 41:20.534
and I think I broke my toe.

41:20.601 --> 41:22.100
And I know I broke the light switch.

41:22.167 --> 41:24.167
That... that would be... that would be fun, you know?

41:24.234 --> 41:26.734
And maybe you could teach me how to hack into the... 

41:26.801 --> 41:28.234
- The grid?
- Yeah.

41:28.300 --> 41:29.967
- You want to hack the grid?
- I want to hack the grid.

41:30.033 --> 41:31.267
Okay. Yeah, I'm down.

41:31.334 --> 41:33.000
Okay, so I cleaned up the last of the mess.

41:33.067 --> 41:35.033
You know, I bet Artie won't even notice.

41:35.100 --> 41:38.667
Won't notice what?

41:40.467 --> 41:42.167
Your welcome-back surprise party.

41:42.234 --> 41:44.768
- Whee!
- Aah, surprise!

41:44.834 --> 41:46.467
You look surprised. Doesn't he look surprised?

41:46.534 --> 41:48.300
Tell me.

41:51.401 --> 41:55.234
The zip line crashed, and
there were these dodgeballs...

41:55.300 --> 41:57.134
and some glop got in the gooery gears.

41:57.200 --> 41:58.768
We went to the dark vault...

41:58.834 --> 42:01.134
- things got sparky...

42:02.534 --> 42:04.367
We fixed it. We fixed it.

42:04.434 --> 42:05.701
- We fixed everything.
- Good as new.

42:05.768 --> 42:08.000
- It's all fixed.
- Totally.

42:08.067 --> 42:10.967
How long did you have before
the warehouse was gonna explode?

42:11.033 --> 42:13.501
- Under a minute.
- More like 30 seconds.

42:13.567 --> 42:14.734
That's lucky.

42:14.801 --> 42:16.267
I once got there with 17,

42:16.334 --> 42:18.667
and her voice gets really annoying

42:18.734 --> 42:22.300
when she's counting down seconds one at a time.

42:22.367 --> 42:24.768
You didn't lose that thing
I had made for you, did you?

42:24.834 --> 42:25.801
The...

42:25.868 --> 42:27.134
- oh, no.

42:27.200 --> 42:28.900
- oh. great.
- it survived.

42:28.967 --> 42:30.501
- That's good.
- Yay.

42:30.567 --> 42:34.834
Wait, are we not in trouble?

42:34.900 --> 42:38.134
You guys had it under control, right?

42:38.200 --> 42:39.567
That we did, amigo.

42:39.634 --> 42:41.534
That we did.

42:41.601 --> 42:43.267
All right, I don't know about
you guys, but I'm starving.

42:43.334 --> 42:44.334
Who wants mexican?

42:44.401 --> 42:46.300
I do. Need tacos stat.

42:46.367 --> 42:47.367
Myka, ¿tu venga?

42:47.434 --> 42:48.734
¿Por que no? Artie?

42:48.801 --> 42:50.134
Uuh, no, I had pie.

42:50.200 --> 42:52.300
Well, I almost had pie.

42:52.367 --> 42:54.701
But go, go, go. Enjoy yourselves.

42:54.768 --> 42:56.734
Enjoy yourselves.

42:56.801 --> 42:59.033
- Now I want pie.
- You always want pie.

42:59.100 --> 43:00.234
Who doesn't want pie?

43:00.300 --> 43:04.033
Uh, maybe just bring me one taco?

43:04.100 --> 43:06.667
Whatever.

43:06.734 --> 43:11.234
and rest up...

43:11.300 --> 43:13.534
because you're gonna need it.
