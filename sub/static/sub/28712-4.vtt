you have Dagda.

00:39.830 --> 00:41.790
What's the commonality here?

JASON MARTELL:
There's, across cultures,

00:54.430 --> 00:56.770
a reference of some type

Beyond it is
the promise of truth.

01:21.880 --> 01:23.920
It demands
we question everything

we have ever been taught.

02:10.470 --> 02:13.760
As Griaule starts collecting
Dogon legends,

02:13.890 --> 02:16.890
he notices an eerie similarity

02:17.010 --> 02:19.560
to ancient tales
found across the globe,

02:19.680 --> 02:22.770
tales of amphibious gods...

02:22.900 --> 02:24.810
In this case, called Nommo,

who came from the sky,

02:26.480 --> 02:27.650
lived in the sea,

02:27.780 --> 02:31.490
and helped mankind.

02:31.610 --> 02:33.950
They described these Nommos

02:34.070 --> 02:37.080
very, like, mermaid-

were these
extraterrestrial gods.

02:48.880 --> 02:52.380
But they needed

weren't the Dogon legends
themselves

03:21.250 --> 03:25.120
but where they said
their amphibious gods came from,

03:25.250 --> 03:30.840
a star that no one on Earth
knew existed until 1862,

03:30.960 --> 03:35.180
long after the Dogon claimed
they knew of its existence.

03:35.300 --> 03:37.050
CHILDRESS:
In the 1930s,

03:37.180 --> 03:40.510
when French anthropologists
were first discussing the Nommo

03:40.640 --> 03:42.640
with these Dogon priests,

03:42.770 --> 03:45.600
the Dogon priests said
that the Nommo were coming

03:45.730 --> 03:48.020
from the star system of Sirius.

03:48.150 --> 03:52.150
Well, the French anthropologists
were amazed at that

03:52.280 --> 03:55.400
and were confused as well.

03:55.530 --> 03:56.820
NARRATOR:
According to the Dogon,

03:56.950 --> 03:59.370
their gods didn't come
from Sirius A,

03:59.490 --> 04:03.040
a star that is clearly visible
in the evening sky,

04:03.160 --> 04:05.500
but from its tiny companion,

04:05.620 --> 04:08.330
a dying star called Sirius B

04:08.460 --> 04:10.710
that can only be seen
with advanced,

04:10.840 --> 04:12.960
high-powered telescopes.

04:13.090 --> 04:17.050
Sirius A is the brightest star
in the sky,

04:17.180 --> 04:19.720
because it is very luminous

04:19.850 --> 04:24.020
and it is also fairly close
to the Earth.

04:24.140 --> 04:26.480
In astronomy, it is a known fact

04:26.600 --> 04:29.730
that there is a Sirius A
and a Sirius B.

04:29.860 --> 04:32.400
Sirius A can be seen.

04:32.520 --> 04:34.900
And Sirius B, for us,

04:35.030 --> 04:36.070
is invisible,

04:36.200 --> 04:37.780
because it's just too small.

04:37.910 --> 04:40.780
Now, the Dogon knew

04:40.910 --> 04:44.240
about the invisible
companion star to Sirius.

04:44.370 --> 04:46.660
How did they know?

04:49.330 --> 04:51.000
NARRATOR:
For thousands of years,

04:51.130 --> 04:54.050
Sirius A has played
an outsized role

04:54.170 --> 04:57.550
in the imagination
of Greeks, Persians,

04:57.670 --> 04:59.640
Hindus, Romans,

04:59.760 --> 05:02.760
Polynesians
and countless others.

05:02.890 --> 05:07.480
The Egyptians even based
their calendar on Sirius A,

05:07.600 --> 05:10.270
and some believe
they aligned the Giza pyramids

05:10.400 --> 05:12.150
to Orion's Belt,

05:12.270 --> 05:14.820
which points to Sirius A.

05:14.940 --> 05:17.490

and along the Euphrates,

05:20.070 --> 05:22.030

they lined up

Sirius is one

05:33.130 --> 05:34.550
of the closest stars to us.

05:34.670 --> 05:36.920
It's 8.6 light-years away.

05:37.050 --> 05:38.760
Unlike the Sun,

05:38.880 --> 05:40.720
which has
a beautiful golden color,

05:40.840 --> 05:43.640
Sirius is a bluish white color,

05:43.760 --> 05:47.640
indicating it's much hotter
than the surface of the Sun,

05:47.770 --> 05:51.100
and that corresponds to it being
more massive than the Sun

05:51.230 --> 05:52.350
and burning hotter.

05:52.480 --> 05:54.690
It'll have a shorter lifespan.

NARRATOR:
But how could the Dogon

05:59.610 --> 06:02.950
have known about the existence
of Sirius B?

06:04.370 --> 06:06.200
Could they have, at one time,

06:06.330 --> 06:09.040
been in possession
of advanced technology?

06:09.160 --> 06:13.250
Or could there be another,
even more profound explanation?

06:13.380 --> 06:16.380
The Dogon had an amazing degree
of knowledge

06:16.500 --> 06:17.920
about the Sirius system.

06:18.050 --> 06:21.010
They knew that the orbits
of the two stars

06:21.130 --> 06:23.180
were about 50 years' period

06:23.300 --> 06:26.810
and that the invisible star
was very dense

06:26.930 --> 06:29.810
and past its prime.

06:29.930 --> 06:32.560
They also knew
that the brighter one

06:32.690 --> 06:35.060
was a larger star than the Sun.

06:35.190 --> 06:37.440
NARRATOR:
The Dogon also knew

06:37.570 --> 06:40.690
that Sirius B
is about the size of Earth

06:40.820 --> 06:44.160
and spins on its axis.

06:44.280 --> 06:48.040
GEORGE NOORY:
There is no logical explanation

06:48.160 --> 06:49.790
for why the Dogon tribe knew

06:49.910 --> 06:52.290
about the Sirius star system
naturally.

06:52.410 --> 06:54.580
We didn't have telescopes
in those days.

06:54.710 --> 06:56.380
How did they know this?

06:56.500 --> 06:58.420
It's as if an ET came here

06:58.550 --> 07:00.380
and just told 'em all
about that.

07:00.510 --> 07:03.260
It's an amazing story.

07:03.380 --> 07:05.970
MICHIO KAKU:
One theory is

07:06.090 --> 07:08.930
maybe the aliens gave them
this knowledge.

07:09.060 --> 07:10.390
It can't be ruled out.

07:10.520 --> 07:12.100
That's one possibility,

07:12.230 --> 07:14.230
because they got it right
on the dot.

07:14.350 --> 07:18.520
NARRATOR: But if a race of
amphibious Nommo came from Sirius B

07:18.650 --> 07:21.230
and gave the Dogon
such gifts of knowledge,

07:21.360 --> 07:24.700
did they only visit
this one desert tribe?

07:26.490 --> 07:30.540
Or did they visit other peoples
in other lands?

07:30.660 --> 07:32.500
TSOUKALOS:
It would be one thing if there's

07:32.620 --> 07:35.750
only one legend
of a fish-man worldwide,

07:35.870 --> 07:38.380
but the Nommo is

07:38.500 --> 07:41.130
one story of dozens

07:41.250 --> 07:44.380

of knowledge

07:44.510 --> 07:46.470
to our ancestors.

07:46.590 --> 07:48.760

talk about this.

07:48.890 --> 07:50.470
The ancient Greeks.

07:50.600 --> 07:54.600

these fish people that,

07:54.730 --> 07:56.600
during the day, taught mankind,

07:56.730 --> 07:58.110
and then, at night,

07:58.230 --> 08:00.270
they wandered back
into the ocean

08:00.400 --> 08:02.150
to just emerge the next day.

08:02.280 --> 08:05.320
NARRATOR:
If the Nommo from Sirius B

08:05.450 --> 08:07.450
visited
numerous ancient cultures,

08:07.570 --> 08:09.030
is it possible

08:09.160 --> 08:11.580
that some physical evidence
survived?

08:13.080 --> 08:16.460
Sierra Leone, Africa.

08:16.580 --> 08:19.920
The early 1990s.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.880

08:26.010 --> 08:29.010
rebels begin forcing villagers
to mine

08:29.140 --> 08:31.970
so-called blood diamonds.

08:32.100 --> 08:34.850
But from deep within the earth
emerges a vast treasure

08:34.980 --> 08:37.600
they weren't expecting...

08:39.440 --> 08:43.900
mysterious figures ranging
from five to ten inches tall,

08:44.030 --> 08:49.450
often with reptilian
or amphibian features.

08:49.570 --> 08:52.490
CHILDRESS:
They're very strange statues.

08:52.620 --> 08:53.910
Some are clay.

08:54.040 --> 08:56.460
Some are of granite
or limestone.

08:56.580 --> 08:58.920
They are humans

08:59.040 --> 09:02.670
and human figures
with lizard heads.

09:02.790 --> 09:05.420
There are hundreds of them.

09:05.550 --> 09:08.300
NARRATOR:
Archaeologists date the statues,

09:08.430 --> 09:09.890
known as the Nomoli,

09:10.010 --> 09:12.260
to around 500 years old,

when Europeans
first came into contact

09:15.140 --> 09:18.560
with the people of Sierra Leone.

09:18.690 --> 09:22.730
But researchers point out that
the statues were found buried

09:22.860 --> 09:25.820
as much as 150 feet deep,

09:25.940 --> 09:30.160
which would suggest
they are extremely ancient.

09:31.530 --> 09:33.370
Normally, the deeper you go,

09:33.490 --> 09:35.790
the more ancient things are.

09:35.910 --> 09:39.660
That indicates great antiquity.

09:39.790 --> 09:42.750
BEN VONDERHEIDE:
We know that Angelo Pitoni

09:42.880 --> 09:45.880
was able to date the strata

09:46.000 --> 09:48.970
to 17,000 years old.

09:49.090 --> 09:50.680
We ask the chiefs

09:50.800 --> 09:53.430
and they'll tell us
they could be even older.

09:53.550 --> 09:56.850
NARRATOR:
17,000 years old?

09:58.640 --> 10:01.690
If true, it would make
the Nomoli statues

10:01.810 --> 10:05.770
among the oldest man-made
artifacts ever found

10:05.900 --> 10:08.530
and date them to 12,000 years

10:08.650 --> 10:12.160
before the first known
civilizations on Earth.

10:12.280 --> 10:15.660
But for ancient astronaut
theorists,

10:15.780 --> 10:18.750
even more interesting
is a strange similarity

10:18.870 --> 10:20.790
between tales of the Nomoli

10:20.910 --> 10:22.620
and the stories
of the Dogon tribe

and their Nommo gods,

10:24.580 --> 10:28.920
1,200 miles away in Mali,

10:29.050 --> 10:32.680
a similarity
that could reveal the identity

10:32.800 --> 10:36.810
of mankind's
extraterrestrial ancestors.

♪ ♪

10:44.350 --> 10:47.190
NARRATOR In the early
1990s, mysterious figurines

10:47.320 --> 10:50.440
were unearthed
in Sierra Leone, Africa,

10:50.570 --> 10:53.570
that were buried in a strata
of the earth so deep,

10:53.700 --> 10:58.410
it suggests they could be
as much as 17,000 years old.

10:58.540 --> 11:02.330
They are believed to represent
gods called the Nomoli

11:02.460 --> 11:06.380
that have been revered by the
native people for centuries.

11:06.500 --> 11:09.550
They are also similar
to the stories

11:09.670 --> 11:11.880
of the Dogon tribe of Mali who,

11:12.010 --> 11:15.140
although located
some 1,200 miles away,

11:15.260 --> 11:18.390
worship gods called the Nommo,

who descended to the Earth
in a whirlwind.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.520
VONDERHEIDE: They were forced to
come down here and live on Earth.

11:23.640 --> 11:26.730
Their eyes were so bright that
you could not look into them

11:26.860 --> 11:29.940
because they shone like the Sun.

11:30.070 --> 11:32.110
And their voices were so
powerful that when they spoke

11:32.240 --> 11:34.860
in one village, you could hear
them in the next village.

11:34.990 --> 11:39.450
MARTELL: They're actually here on
Earth as guides helping humanity.

11:39.580 --> 11:42.660
So this is a very interesting
tale that we see across cultures

11:42.790 --> 11:45.370
where they actually have some
interaction with beings

11:45.500 --> 11:48.290

Like the Nommo, the Nomoli gods

11:53.050 --> 11:55.590
are depicted as having
amphibious traits,

and are often shown
entwined with crocodiles.

12:01.930 --> 12:05.140
BIRNES: The Nommo and the

that the creatures
that came to Earth

12:07.400 --> 12:09.440
hundreds of thousands
of years ago

12:09.560 --> 12:11.610
were somehow aquatic creatures?

12:11.730 --> 12:14.990
NOORY:
It's very conceivable

12:15.110 --> 12:18.490
that ET races that came here
many, many, many years ago

12:18.620 --> 12:21.830
looked like maybe an
alligator standing upright.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.830
Who knows?

12:23.950 --> 12:26.410
It's very conceivable
that's what they saw.

12:28.630 --> 12:30.920
NARRATOR:
Could the Nomoli and the Nommo

12:31.040 --> 12:33.800
represent the same
extraterrestrial visitors?

12:33.920 --> 12:38.970
And could those visitors
have come from Sirius B?

12:39.090 --> 12:42.970
HENRY: Words are thought
of as thought fossils.

12:43.100 --> 12:45.560
They are a record
into themselves,

12:45.680 --> 12:47.600
and when we begin
to compare words,

12:47.730 --> 12:49.690
we find some
very interesting things.

12:49.810 --> 12:52.820
In Sierra Leone, we learn
of statues called Nomoli.

12:52.940 --> 12:55.530
Then we flip over to the Dogon,

12:55.650 --> 12:58.700
and we find that they worshipped
a god called Nommo.

12:58.820 --> 13:01.990
Is there a linkage
between these two cultures

13:02.120 --> 13:04.330
that are supposed
to be entirely separate?

13:04.450 --> 13:06.500
Linguists would argue
that there is.

13:06.620 --> 13:09.120
NARRATOR:
Perhaps the most enticing clue

13:09.250 --> 13:11.170
as to the Nomoli's true origins

13:11.290 --> 13:14.340
was discovered
in the early 1990s,

13:14.460 --> 13:16.510
when one of the mysterious
Nomoli figurines

13:16.630 --> 13:20.010
was found to contain
a chromium sphere.

13:20.140 --> 13:22.680
TSOUKALOS:
Inside of it they found

13:22.800 --> 13:26.350
a sphere made of chromium.

13:26.470 --> 13:29.850
The fascinating thing
about this is that chromium

13:29.980 --> 13:34.440
was not isolated by us
until 1797.

13:34.570 --> 13:37.320
NARRATOR:
But how is it possible

13:37.440 --> 13:40.200
that this sphere
was placed inside a statue

13:40.320 --> 13:45.910
made 17,000 years before
scientists isolated chromium?

13:46.040 --> 13:48.040
VONDERHEIDE: There are
two schools of thought.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.250
One would be that there
were ancient civilizations

13:50.370 --> 13:52.330
which were far advanced
in that area,

13:52.460 --> 13:57.460
which have been absorbed
back into the jungle.

13:57.590 --> 14:00.760
And the second one is
that there was an influence

14:00.880 --> 14:04.600
from some extraterrestrial
beings that came from the sky.

14:06.470 --> 14:08.310
BRANDENBURG:
This is absolutely inexplicable

14:08.430 --> 14:11.230
in present paleontology.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.770
You have to assume
that there was a contact

14:13.900 --> 14:15.690
with an advanced technology.

14:15.820 --> 14:19.280
NARRATOR:
But if this chromium sphere

14:19.400 --> 14:22.530
was produced by extraterrestrial
visitors to Earth,

14:22.660 --> 14:27.120
what was the purpose of placing
it inside a Nomoli statue?

14:28.540 --> 14:30.370
Some believe the answer may lie

14:30.500 --> 14:34.750
in a further examination
of Sirius B.

MARTELL: We have to wonder
if this isn't some type

14:37.170 --> 14:40.420
of representation of Sirius B.

14:40.550 --> 14:42.840
The Sirius system is always
thought of

14:42.970 --> 14:44.590
as one of
the best possible places

14:44.720 --> 14:46.260
for where we would find
intelligent life.

14:47.930 --> 14:51.480
Could Sirius B be one of
the home places of gods

14:51.600 --> 14:54.980
that came from that star system
and brought ancient knowledge?

14:56.940 --> 14:59.650
NARRATOR: Perhaps further
clues can be found

14:59.780 --> 15:03.780
by examining a sacred syllable
that ties the Dogon

15:03.910 --> 15:08.330
to a civilization thousands
of miles away.

15:12.120 --> 15:15.040
Paris, France.

15:15.170 --> 15:18.170
Ancient astronaut
theorists believe

15:18.290 --> 15:20.880
that housed in the Louvre
is an unlikely clue

15:21.010 --> 15:24.130
to the mystery
of the Dogon tribe of Mali.

15:26.050 --> 15:28.430
It's a carved stone
made of basalt

15:28.560 --> 15:31.310
with a depiction
of the Babylonian King Hammurabi

15:31.430 --> 15:35.810
speaking with a divine being.

15:35.940 --> 15:37.810
Below them, carved in cuneiform,

15:37.940 --> 15:41.440
is perhaps the most significant
legal text in the ancient world,

15:41.570 --> 15:45.070
the Code of Hammurabi.

15:45.200 --> 15:47.240
TSOUKALOS: King Hammurabi
ruled ancient Babylon

15:47.370 --> 15:49.910
in the 18th century BC,

15:50.030 --> 15:52.660
and he devised the world's
first known set of laws.

15:52.790 --> 15:54.910
For example,
this is where we get the idea

15:55.040 --> 15:56.580
of an eye for an eye.

15:56.710 --> 15:59.340
But what's fascinating to me

15:59.460 --> 16:02.380
is that, according
to King Hammurabi himself,

16:02.510 --> 16:06.550
this was dictated to him by
a being that came from the sky.

16:08.220 --> 16:10.560
In my mind, King Hammurabi

16:10.680 --> 16:13.520
was documenting
exactly what happened:

16:13.640 --> 16:17.230
He was advised
by an extraterrestrial.

16:19.190 --> 16:22.530
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest that not only

16:22.650 --> 16:25.070
were the Babylonian gods
extraterrestrials

16:25.200 --> 16:29.370
who instructed King Hammurabi,
but that one of them provides

16:29.490 --> 16:33.080
an intriguing connection
to the Dogon of Africa

16:33.200 --> 16:36.540
and their amphibious visitors
from Sirius B.

16:36.660 --> 16:40.500
That god... the chief god
of the Babylonians...

16:40.630 --> 16:43.710
Was called Dagon.

16:43.840 --> 16:47.720
CHILDRESS:
They have a god named Dagon.

16:47.840 --> 16:52.180
And, it, too, is
an amphibious human god.

16:52.310 --> 16:56.020
NARRATOR:
The Babylonian god Dagon

16:56.140 --> 16:58.940
sounds eerily similar
to the Dogon tribe,

16:59.060 --> 17:03.820
who claim they were visited
by beings from Sirius B.

17:03.940 --> 17:09.069
Is that because the Dogon named
themselves after the same god?

17:10.990 --> 17:13.619
The ancient Babylonians
had a god...

17:13.740 --> 17:17.960
Half-human, half-fish...
Called Dagon.

17:18.079 --> 17:23.380
Is there a relationship between
the Dogon and the Dagon,

17:23.500 --> 17:25.210
and the deity of the Babylonians

17:25.339 --> 17:27.089
that brought civilization
to Earth?

17:27.220 --> 17:28.930
Absolutely there could be
a relationship.

♪ ♪

17:31.220 --> 17:32.970
NARRATOR:
The Babylonians worshipped Dagon

or the "House of the Star."

17:36.810 --> 17:40.190
Could this be Sirius B?

17:40.310 --> 17:43.570

17:43.690 --> 17:47.780
the Dogon in Africa and the
Babylonians in the Middle East

17:47.900 --> 17:51.410

Perhaps Dag or Dog...

17:51.530 --> 17:54.030
Embedded in both places?

17:54.160 --> 17:58.040
TSOUKALOS: What if,
when the extraterrestrials visited,

17:58.160 --> 18:01.250
our ancestors listened
to their language...

18:01.370 --> 18:05.000
Words with dag, dog, something

18:05.130 --> 18:09.760
that was the most prevalent term
that they just heard?

18:09.880 --> 18:13.510
So the idea that we have
these cultures

18:13.640 --> 18:16.930
where the root word is the same
indicates to me

18:17.060 --> 18:20.850
all these ancient cultures were
visited by the same people.

18:20.980 --> 18:24.770
NARRATOR: According to
ancient astronaut theorists,

18:24.900 --> 18:28.860
the extraterrestrials implanted
evidence of their visitation

18:28.990 --> 18:31.820
within the traditions of
the cultures they encountered.

18:31.950 --> 18:35.160
And further proof of this
can be found

18:35.280 --> 18:38.580
by examining
another early civilization

on the opposite side

18:59.930 --> 19:02.730
Emperor Akihito abdicates

including his eldest son
Crown Prince Naruhito.

Four months later,
Naruhito succeeds his father

19:15.660 --> 19:18.410
and ascends
to the Chrysanthemum Throne,

19:18.530 --> 19:21.910
carrying on a tradition of the
oldest royal family on Earth,

19:22.040 --> 19:27.630
stretching back
over 2,500 years to 660 BC.

19:27.750 --> 19:31.760
According to legend,
the Japanese Imperial family

19:31.880 --> 19:34.680
is descended
from divine amphibious beings,

19:34.800 --> 19:37.350
who, like
the Babylonian god Dagon

19:37.470 --> 19:39.430
and the Dogon gods of Mali,

19:39.560 --> 19:42.890
came from the sky
and lived in the sea.

19:43.020 --> 19:47.520
The Japanese name
for these beings is Doragun.

19:47.650 --> 19:50.570
In English we call them dragons.

19:52.860 --> 19:55.860
Emperor Jimmu,
who is the founder

19:55.990 --> 19:58.410
of the Japanese imperial line,

19:58.530 --> 20:02.410
was supposedly a descendant
of the Dragon King.

20:02.540 --> 20:05.960
And the Dragon King lived
in a underwater palace

20:06.080 --> 20:09.880
that was massive
and-and very prosperous.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.590
And through successive
marriages,

20:12.710 --> 20:17.890
eventually his descendants
became rulers of Japan.

20:18.010 --> 20:20.890
CHILDRESS:
Early myths indicated

20:21.010 --> 20:23.100
that the dragon was also

20:23.220 --> 20:27.520
an amphibious water-type animal.

20:27.650 --> 20:32.280
Also, in some ways, a half-man,
half-amphibious type.

20:32.400 --> 20:38.200
He later morphed into
a flying serpent, as we know.

20:38.320 --> 20:42.700
NARRATOR: The Japanese
language is unique to Japan,

20:42.830 --> 20:45.870
and also isn't connected
to any other language,

20:46.000 --> 20:50.420
not even other Asian languages
such as Korean and Chinese.

20:50.540 --> 20:54.800
Yet the Japanese word for this
creature is strikingly similar

20:54.920 --> 20:58.090
to words embedded in languages
all over the world.

20:58.220 --> 21:00.890
Doragun in Japanese.

21:01.010 --> 21:04.310
Dragon in English.

21:04.430 --> 21:07.060
Dregan in India.

21:07.190 --> 21:11.110
Dragoni in Swahili.

21:11.230 --> 21:14.690
Drakontion in ancient Greek.

21:14.820 --> 21:17.570
And Dragoi in the Basque
language found in Europe,

21:17.700 --> 21:21.870
which is also unconnected
to any other language.

21:21.990 --> 21:24.950
So once again we have
that similar word:

21:25.080 --> 21:29.080
Dogon. Dagon. Dragon.

21:29.210 --> 21:34.130
So perhaps all of these words
are indicating these half-human,

21:34.250 --> 21:36.880
half-amphibious
extraterrestrials.

21:39.590 --> 21:43.260
NARRATOR: Do these linguistic
similarities suggest that the Japanese

21:43.390 --> 21:47.350
were visited by the same beings
from Sirius B

21:47.480 --> 21:49.890
that were encountered
by the Dogon in Mali,

21:50.020 --> 21:54.190
the people of Sierra Leone,
and the Babylonians?

21:54.320 --> 21:58.780
Ancient astronaut theorists say
yes and suggest that

21:58.900 --> 22:02.570
actual physical evidence
of the connection also exists

22:02.700 --> 22:07.410
in the form of strange figurines
found buried all over Japan.

22:09.500 --> 22:13.790
Tokyo National Museum, Japan.

22:13.920 --> 22:17.260
The country's oldest national
museum is home to a collection

22:17.380 --> 22:20.590
of mysterious clay statues
that date as far back

22:20.720 --> 22:23.140
as 10,000 years.

22:23.260 --> 22:26.720
More than 18,000 of these
figurines have been found

22:26.850 --> 22:28.930
throughout the Japanese islands.

22:29.060 --> 22:32.140
And again, their name is
eerily familiar.

22:32.270 --> 22:34.940
They are called the dog...

22:36.980 --> 22:40.150
The dogu are
small clay figurines

22:40.280 --> 22:44.450
that are usually about
15 to 30 centimeters in height,

22:44.570 --> 22:47.080
and they date from one
of the earliest periods

22:47.200 --> 22:51.410
of Japanese history,
from about 14,000 BC

22:51.540 --> 22:53.290
to 1000 BC.

22:55.290 --> 22:57.880
NARRATOR: Much like the
similarly-sized Nomoli figurines

22:58.000 --> 23:02.010
in Sierra Leone,
more than 8,000 miles away,

23:02.130 --> 23:06.260
the dogu were also found
buried deep in the earth.

23:06.390 --> 23:10.390
STEAVU: When one buries something,
one is expressing reverence for it.

23:10.520 --> 23:15.100
So if you find something that's
buried with a lot of care

23:15.230 --> 23:18.520
and ritual preparation,
it means it could be

23:18.650 --> 23:21.490
some kind of sacred item.

23:21.610 --> 23:24.160
NARRATOR: But perhaps the
strangest thing about the dogu

23:24.280 --> 23:26.320
is what they're wearing.

23:26.450 --> 23:29.040
So, here we have a replica
of a dogu statue,

23:29.160 --> 23:31.120
which is life-size.

23:31.250 --> 23:33.620
You have patterns that are
represented here

23:33.750 --> 23:35.830
that look almost technological
in nature.

23:35.960 --> 23:39.090
And if we focus
on goggle features

23:39.210 --> 23:42.800
of the dogu statues that have
led many people to speculate

23:42.920 --> 23:45.130
that this, in fact, might be
some kind of helmet

23:45.260 --> 23:47.050
that's part of a space suit.

23:47.180 --> 23:50.680
You really have to wonder
what's going on here because,

23:50.810 --> 23:54.230
in the case of the dogu,
if you look at this

23:54.350 --> 23:57.690
from a modern-day perspective,
in my opinion,

23:57.810 --> 24:01.530
those are people in some type
of space suits.

24:04.860 --> 24:08.030
NARRATOR: For ancient astronaut
theorists, even more intriguing

24:08.160 --> 24:12.290
than the appearance of these
figurines is their name... dogu,

24:12.410 --> 24:18.210
once again echoing divine names
found across multiple cultures.

24:18.330 --> 24:20.500
HENRY: Here we are talking
about a civilization

24:20.630 --> 24:23.510
on the island of Japan
that is entirely separate,

24:23.630 --> 24:26.510
far across the ocean,
a vast distance

24:26.630 --> 24:30.600
from Africa and Egypt
and Mesopotamia,

24:30.720 --> 24:35.100
yet they worship a deity with
the very same name phonetically.

24:35.230 --> 24:37.140
Is it the same being?

24:37.270 --> 24:39.150
Common sense tell us
we have to at least

24:39.270 --> 24:40.860
consider that as a possibility.

24:43.570 --> 24:46.900
NARRATOR: If uncanny cultural
and linguistic similarities

24:47.030 --> 24:49.780
found in different parts
of the world are the result

24:49.910 --> 24:52.200
of extraterrestrial visitation,

24:52.330 --> 24:55.660
wouldn't there be
physical evidence as well?

24:55.790 --> 25:00.580
Some alien artifact left behind
that could prove our ancestors

25:00.710 --> 25:04.920
had contact with beings
from another world?

25:05.050 --> 25:08.430
According to ancient astronaut
theorists, there is.

25:13.720 --> 25:17.350
From the mysterious statues
of Sierra Leone...

25:18.600 --> 25:21.400
to the Dogon tribe of Mali...

25:21.520 --> 25:25.190
and the Babylonian worship
of Dagon...

25:25.320 --> 25:28.030
to the Japanese stories
of dragons

25:28.150 --> 25:32.780
and the curious dogu figures...

25:32.910 --> 25:35.160
according
to ancient astronaut theorists,

25:35.290 --> 25:38.540
there are eerie similarities
between ancient cultures

25:38.660 --> 25:40.580
that indicate
they were all visited

25:40.710 --> 25:42.840
by the same
extraterrestrial beings...

25:44.000 --> 25:47.170
from Sirius B.

25:47.300 --> 25:51.090
If there were beings
from the Sirius star system...

25:53.220 --> 25:55.720
they may have come
for a short period of time.

25:55.850 --> 25:58.600
They may have been
harvesting metals.

25:58.730 --> 26:00.940
They may have been harvesting
genetic material,

26:01.060 --> 26:02.020
and then they go.

26:05.940 --> 26:08.320
NARRATOR: But is there
any physical evidence?

26:08.440 --> 26:13.370
For some, the presence of a
chromium sphere inside a statue

26:13.490 --> 26:16.740
estimated to be 17,000 years old

26:16.870 --> 26:20.370
and ancient figurines that
appear to depict space suits

26:20.500 --> 26:22.420
are proof enough.

26:22.540 --> 26:27.800
But could there also be actual
artifacts from another world?

26:27.920 --> 26:31.340
NARRATOR: Among the
people of Sierra Leone,

26:31.470 --> 26:34.010
local legend has it
that when their Nomoli gods

26:34.140 --> 26:38.060
fell from heaven,
part of the sky turned to stone

26:38.180 --> 26:41.640
and rained down with them.

26:41.770 --> 26:46.270
These strange blue stones,
called sky stones,

26:46.400 --> 26:49.440
have been found
with the statues.

26:49.570 --> 26:51.400
And at first
archaeologists thought,

26:51.530 --> 26:53.700
"Okay, it's just blue stones."

26:53.820 --> 26:56.740
But when they analyzed it,
they couldn't figure out

26:56.870 --> 26:59.870
how these had been made, too.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.580
Although the people in Sierra
Leone felt that they were

27:02.710 --> 27:07.840
actually pieces of the blue sky
that fell with the Nomoli.

27:07.960 --> 27:12.380
NARRATOR: If these mysterious
blue stones are really connected

27:12.510 --> 27:16.800
to the legend of the sky turning
to stone and raining down

27:16.930 --> 27:21.140
on the Earth with the arrival of
the Nomoli, what could they be?

27:21.270 --> 27:26.020
Some type of protective covering
for an alien spacecraft?

27:26.150 --> 27:29.730
Pieces of a heat shield,
perhaps, like the tiles that

27:29.860 --> 27:31.860
covered the bottom
of the space shuttle?

27:31.990 --> 27:36.450
And if so, might further
scientific examination of them

27:36.570 --> 27:39.580
support the idea
that the Nomoli were actually

27:39.700 --> 27:41.660
extraterrestrial visitors,

27:41.790 --> 27:44.920
perhaps from the Sirius
star system?

27:46.580 --> 27:48.250
Seattle, Washington.

27:48.380 --> 27:52.170
March 6, 2019.

27:52.300 --> 27:56.050
In search of further evidence
that the Nomoli statues

27:56.180 --> 27:58.430
may have
an extraterrestrial connection,

27:58.550 --> 28:02.350
ancient astronaut theorist
David Childress has arranged

28:02.470 --> 28:04.850
to meet up
with sky stone collector

28:04.980 --> 28:07.730
- and researcher Jared Collins.
- Okay, wow.

28:07.860 --> 28:09.570
NARRATOR:
Jared has in his possession

28:09.690 --> 28:12.150
a number
of the mysterious blue stones

28:12.280 --> 28:14.320
that were found
near the statues.

28:15.910 --> 28:18.240
Jared has been collecting
sky stones

28:18.370 --> 28:21.910
since he first heard about them
in 2013.

28:22.040 --> 28:25.790
He became fascinated
by their enigmatic nature,

28:25.920 --> 28:29.210
betraying neither obvious
mineral nor man-made origin.

28:32.090 --> 28:33.840
So, how was it that these stones
were actually discovered

28:33.960 --> 28:35.220
in modern time?

28:35.340 --> 28:38.510
This was actually discovered
in 1991

28:38.640 --> 28:40.260
by a man named David Leadbetter.

28:40.390 --> 28:43.520
He was in Sierra Leone
on a mining concession,

28:43.640 --> 28:45.230
looking for gold and diamonds.

28:45.350 --> 28:49.100
And when he was having
his crew dig,

28:49.230 --> 28:52.520
occasionally these stones
would appear.

28:52.650 --> 28:56.320
And interestingly, David went
to the village chief

28:56.450 --> 28:59.200
to ask if he'd ever seen
any of these stones before.

28:59.320 --> 29:01.950
And the chief said that
when these stones are found,

29:02.080 --> 29:05.000
large amounts of gold
and diamonds usually follow

29:05.120 --> 29:07.540
shortly thereafter.

29:07.670 --> 29:10.420
What do other geologists say
about stones like this?

29:10.540 --> 29:12.500
Are they able to identify them?

29:12.630 --> 29:14.800
We've sent these now
to 12 different labs.

29:14.920 --> 29:17.420
There is not one piece
of consensus in here.

29:17.550 --> 29:18.720
Everybody has
a different opinion.

29:18.840 --> 29:21.050
We still don't know, actually,

29:21.180 --> 29:22.890
if these are natural
or man-made.

29:23.010 --> 29:24.810
- So maybe it's from another planet.
- I don't know.

29:24.930 --> 29:27.020
I really wish I did,
and I would love a chance

29:27.140 --> 29:29.060
to actually be able to get this
in front of somebody else

29:29.190 --> 29:30.650
who could look at it again.

29:30.770 --> 29:33.230
I've got some friends
at the University of Washington,

29:33.360 --> 29:35.030
and I think we can set this up

29:35.150 --> 29:36.820
- and have another test done.
- That would be fantastic.

29:36.940 --> 29:39.490
I would love to get
some consensus on this

29:39.610 --> 29:41.950
to understand
what this actually is.

29:42.070 --> 29:44.870
NARRATOR: While tests
conducted on the stones found

29:44.990 --> 29:48.330
with the Nomoli statues have
so far produced conflicting

29:48.460 --> 29:51.880
and sometimes
even confounding results,

29:52.000 --> 29:55.800
David is eager to have them
tested for himself.

30:00.550 --> 30:04.350
At the University of Washington,
David and Jared meet

30:04.470 --> 30:08.100
with renowned geologist
Professor Peter Ward.

30:08.230 --> 30:09.520
Hi, I'm David Childress.

30:09.640 --> 30:10.940
- David.
- I talked to you on the phone.

30:11.060 --> 30:11.980
It's good to meet you.

30:12.100 --> 30:13.150
And this is Jared Collins.

30:13.270 --> 30:15.270
Thank you so much
for seeing us today.

30:15.400 --> 30:16.690
Jared, both of you guys,

30:16.820 --> 30:19.240
welcome to the University
of Washington IsoLab.

30:19.360 --> 30:22.240
So, what do we have
in this beautiful box?

30:22.360 --> 30:24.830
Well, we're sort of hoping
that you can tell us.

30:28.500 --> 30:31.540
Well, well, well,
what are these beauties?

30:31.670 --> 30:34.130
We have been through
many tests on these,

30:34.250 --> 30:36.130
and no one can identify them.

30:36.250 --> 30:39.170
They cannot tell us whether
these are natural or artificial,

30:39.300 --> 30:42.130
what's causing the blue color,
if this is ancient or modern.

30:42.260 --> 30:43.590
So, they've been checked

30:43.720 --> 30:46.060
for the common blue minerals,
I take it.

30:46.180 --> 30:48.720
One thing that we know for sure
is that this is not turquoise,

30:48.850 --> 30:51.560
this is not lapis,
this is not erinite.

30:51.690 --> 30:54.440
WARD: The fact that it's
so unbelievably light

30:54.560 --> 30:58.440
really suggests that there's
an organic component to it.

30:58.570 --> 31:01.360
Anything that goes blue,
generally, is much heavier.

31:01.490 --> 31:03.740
So this is...
This is really a mystery.

31:03.860 --> 31:06.200
I should mention also
that this only comes

31:06.330 --> 31:09.750
from one very specific part,
from one very specific village.

31:09.870 --> 31:11.910
It has never been found
anywhere else in the world.

31:12.040 --> 31:15.170
Well, let's do a test
that removes any doubt

31:15.290 --> 31:17.420
about them being partly organic.

31:19.130 --> 31:21.130
So, Erin is gonna
take this rock,

31:21.260 --> 31:26.010
and she's gonna scrape it
into these tiny little tin cups.

31:26.140 --> 31:27.430
The tin cups themselves

31:27.550 --> 31:30.470
we'll load
into our mass spectrograph.

31:30.600 --> 31:33.100
They will then be heated
to 1,000 degrees centigrade.

31:33.230 --> 31:36.310
Everything inside will combust
and turn to gas.

31:36.440 --> 31:38.980
And those individual gas
molecules will then be sampled,

31:39.110 --> 31:43.200
and we can examine if there are
any truly organic molecules

31:43.320 --> 31:45.530
in this rock.

31:45.660 --> 31:49.410
Was there some life process that
was involved in its formation?

31:49.540 --> 31:53.620
NARRATOR: Will the tests performed
on the so-called sky stones

31:53.750 --> 31:57.630
reveal that they contain
previously undiscovered

31:57.750 --> 32:02.970
organic material,
possibly from a different world?

32:03.090 --> 32:07.090
And if so, could it mean
that both the sky stones

32:07.220 --> 32:09.810
and the Nomoli statues
are evidence

32:09.930 --> 32:12.270
of an extraterrestrial event

32:12.390 --> 32:16.980
that occurred on Earth
centuries ago?

32:21.610 --> 32:27.160
NARRATOR:
Sedona, Arizona, March 2019.

32:27.280 --> 32:30.200
Two weeks after bringing
the so-called sky stones

32:30.330 --> 32:32.040
found in Sierra Leone

32:32.160 --> 32:35.160
to the University of Washington
for examination,

32:35.290 --> 32:38.000
David Childress
received an e-mail

32:38.130 --> 32:40.710
from geologist Dr. Peter Ward.

32:40.840 --> 32:44.380
In the e-mail, Dr. Ward wrote
that the results

32:44.510 --> 32:47.430
were so strange,
they ran the tests three times,

32:47.550 --> 32:50.140
thinking it was a machine error,

32:50.260 --> 32:53.310
and added,
"This gives me the creeps."

32:53.430 --> 32:56.940
To learn more,
Childress contacted Dr. Ward

32:57.060 --> 32:58.270
through video chat.

32:58.400 --> 33:00.190
Hi, Dr. Ward.

33:00.310 --> 33:02.520
So I wanted to learn
about the results.

33:02.650 --> 33:04.190
Yeah, it's pretty cool.
I mean, it was much stranger

33:04.320 --> 33:06.240
than we thought.

33:06.360 --> 33:09.450
There really seems to be some
sort of organic aspect to this.

33:09.570 --> 33:13.990
It's got element nitrogen in it
in really high concentrations.

33:14.120 --> 33:17.920
Having this high amount of
nitrogen puts it into a, "Wow,

33:18.040 --> 33:20.750
that's a very peculiar rock"
category.

33:20.880 --> 33:24.670
We were looking for a possible
extraterrestrial origin.

33:24.800 --> 33:27.380
Is it possibly a meteorite
or even part

33:27.510 --> 33:30.140
of a spaceship that exploded?

33:30.260 --> 33:32.890
(laughs) Let's just say
that there's a possibility

33:33.010 --> 33:34.770
that it came from off the Earth.

33:34.890 --> 33:39.560
As we scientists say,
it's worth more study.

33:39.690 --> 33:41.560
Thanks again
for doing these tests

33:41.690 --> 33:43.980
and letting us use your lab.

33:44.110 --> 33:45.820
Yeah, no problem. See you later.

33:45.940 --> 33:49.240
NARRATOR: Although the sky
stones are still a mystery,

33:49.360 --> 33:51.740
David and Jared have confirmed

33:51.870 --> 33:55.200
that they are unlike
any other stone ever examined.

33:55.330 --> 33:59.040
Could they have arrived on Earth
with the strange beings

33:59.160 --> 34:01.380
that are depicted
in the Nomoli statues?

34:01.500 --> 34:04.290
Is this perhaps
physical evidence

34:04.420 --> 34:07.380
that the linguistic similarities
found across the globe...

34:07.510 --> 34:13.100
Dogon, Dagon, dragon, dogu...

34:13.219 --> 34:16.810
Point to some sort of
extraterrestrial intervention?

34:16.929 --> 34:20.520
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

34:20.639 --> 34:24.150
and they claim that in yet
another earthly location

34:24.270 --> 34:27.730
may be found the most
significant evidence of all,

34:27.860 --> 34:31.489
a possible alien home base.

34:33.870 --> 34:37.199
County Meath, Ireland.

34:37.330 --> 34:40.159
Here in the Boyne River Valley,

34:40.290 --> 34:43.500
a large circular mound
rises out of the earth,

34:43.630 --> 34:49.050
the Newgrange Passage Tomb,
built around 3200 BC.

34:49.170 --> 34:53.179
It was constructed
with over 200,000 tons of stone

34:53.300 --> 34:58.640
quarried 75 miles away,
and contains one passageway

34:58.770 --> 35:01.850
that leads
to a centralized chamber.

35:01.980 --> 35:04.690
NEWMAN: Newgrange is one
of the most important sites

35:04.810 --> 35:06.690
in all of Europe.

35:06.820 --> 35:10.820
It was possibly a stone circle
with 36 or 37 stones,

35:10.940 --> 35:13.780
only 12 of these still remain,
and after that,

35:13.910 --> 35:17.870
a huge mound
made of stone and earth

35:17.990 --> 35:20.660
was built within
the stone circle itself.

35:20.790 --> 35:23.500
Within this,
we have a huge chamber

35:23.620 --> 35:26.040
which is a cruciform shape,
or a cross.

35:26.170 --> 35:30.260
It's got some beautiful carvings
on the 97 curbstones

35:30.380 --> 35:33.470
that go around the edge, as well
as on the main entrance stone,

35:33.590 --> 35:35.970
and within the chamber itself,

35:36.090 --> 35:40.970
mainly zigzags and spirals
and most notably a triple spiral

35:41.100 --> 35:45.810
at the back of the main chamber
within the actual site itself.

35:45.940 --> 35:50.730
NARRATOR: Newgrange was designed
to honor the winter solstice,

35:50.860 --> 35:53.570
but according to a book
published in 2012

35:53.700 --> 35:56.370
called
<i>The Newgrange Sirius Mystery,</i>

35:56.490 --> 35:58.910
the entire mound was also built

35:59.030 --> 36:03.210
to align with the star Sirius A
in the night sky.

36:03.330 --> 36:05.620
NEWMAN: The declination
of Sirius is the same

36:05.750 --> 36:09.540
as the winter solstice sunrise
moving across the sky,

36:09.670 --> 36:13.380
and through the lightbox,
which is a rectangular area

36:13.510 --> 36:15.630
just above the main entrance,

36:15.760 --> 36:17.090
this is where you witness

36:17.220 --> 36:18.800
not only the sunlight
coming through

36:18.930 --> 36:20.890
but also later in the day,

36:21.010 --> 36:23.270
Sirius light coming through
as well.

36:26.730 --> 36:29.190
NARRATOR: The Dogon of
Mali in West Africa claimed

36:29.310 --> 36:33.400
that their gods came to Earth
from the star Sirius B.

36:33.530 --> 36:38.620
Ancient astronaut theorists
connect these visitors

36:38.740 --> 36:41.620
to gods with similar names
all over the world.

36:44.370 --> 36:46.370
But they also point out
an intriguing connection

36:46.500 --> 36:49.630
to Newgrange in Ireland.

36:49.750 --> 36:53.000
In addition to being in line
with the star Sirius,

36:53.130 --> 36:57.130
legend says that this megalith
was built by a Celtic god

36:57.260 --> 37:01.600
with a name that sounds,
by now, eerily familiar:

37:01.720 --> 37:04.180
The god Dagda.

37:04.310 --> 37:07.270
CHILDRESS: The main god
that's associated with Newgrange

37:07.390 --> 37:08.980
is called Dagda.

37:09.100 --> 37:11.860
So here, once again,
we have this same word

37:11.980 --> 37:16.780
that appears to mean something
about gods coming from Sirius.

37:16.900 --> 37:18.860
HENRY: The dwellers
of the British Isles

37:18.990 --> 37:21.700
worshipped a god named Dagda.

37:21.830 --> 37:24.370
That cannot be by coincidence.

37:24.490 --> 37:27.870
NARRATOR: The god known as Dagda
was said to be the leader of a group

37:28.000 --> 37:32.170
of otherworldly beings
called the Tuatha Dé Danann.

37:32.290 --> 37:36.630
NEWMAN: The Tuatha Dé Danann
were this renowned fairy race

37:36.760 --> 37:38.970
that arrived mysteriously
in Ireland

37:39.090 --> 37:40.930
many thousands of years ago.

37:41.050 --> 37:46.390
The supreme deity of the Tuatha
Dé Danann was Dagda, Dagda Mul.

37:46.520 --> 37:49.690
And he was a renowned god.

37:49.810 --> 37:53.900
He was said to have built
and lived inside Newgrange.

37:54.020 --> 37:56.400
They had very advanced weaponry

37:56.530 --> 38:00.490
and different types
of what sounds like machinery.

38:00.610 --> 38:03.700
But also they taught
the high arts of civilization,

38:03.830 --> 38:06.580
and they were said to be almost
like the Shining Ones

38:06.700 --> 38:08.960
of the biblical tradition.

38:09.080 --> 38:10.830
It's almost like
a science fiction movie

38:10.960 --> 38:14.040
when you start looking
at these ancient Irish myths.

38:14.170 --> 38:16.420
(wind whooshing)

38:16.550 --> 38:20.300
NARRATOR: Could Newgrange have once
been an alien outpost on Earth?

38:20.430 --> 38:23.300
Was Dagda the supreme leader
of a race

38:23.430 --> 38:26.220
of highly advanced
extraterrestrials

38:26.350 --> 38:28.730
that came to Earth
and left a lasting influence

38:28.850 --> 38:30.730
on our ancestors?

38:31.940 --> 38:33.810
Perhaps the answer can be found

38:33.940 --> 38:37.400
by examining the Dog Star.

38:45.080 --> 38:46.660
NARRATOR Across the world,

38:46.790 --> 38:49.960
ancient people claimed they were
visited by amphibious beings

38:50.080 --> 38:54.580
from Sirius who gave the gift
of knowledge and technology.

38:54.710 --> 38:56.920
The Dogon of Mali.

38:57.050 --> 39:00.220
Dagon of the Babylonians.

39:00.340 --> 39:02.590
The dogu of Japan.

39:02.720 --> 39:05.390
Dagda of Ireland.

39:05.510 --> 39:08.310
And the dragon, whose name
echoes in languages

39:08.430 --> 39:10.600
all over the world.

39:12.810 --> 39:15.020
You have to wonder,
is it possible

39:15.150 --> 39:16.940
that all the root words

39:17.070 --> 39:19.900
come from the same visitors?

39:20.030 --> 39:24.490
And my answer to that
is a resounding yes.

39:24.610 --> 39:28.540
NARRATOR: But what about
the English language?

39:28.660 --> 39:30.830
Is there any connection
in English

39:30.950 --> 39:35.420
between the ancient syllable Dog
or Dag and the star Sirius?

39:35.540 --> 39:40.050
Experts say the answer
is hiding in plain sight.

39:40.170 --> 39:43.680
KAKU:
Sirius is the Dog Star.

39:43.800 --> 39:45.220
Tonight, when you go outside,

39:45.340 --> 39:47.680
look for the three stars
that make up Orion,

39:47.800 --> 39:52.980
and Orion's belt has an arrow
that points right to Sirius.

39:53.100 --> 39:56.310
So you can see Sirius,
the Dog Star, tonight.

39:56.440 --> 39:58.110
In fact, today,

39:58.230 --> 40:01.190
the reason we talk
about the dog days of summer

40:01.320 --> 40:05.610
is that those are the days
that Sirius is overhead.

40:05.740 --> 40:08.580
It's very interesting
that these beings said

40:08.700 --> 40:10.490
they came from Sirius,

40:10.620 --> 40:13.500
which we call the Dog Star,
because when etymologists

40:13.620 --> 40:16.670
try to trace the origins
of the English word "dog,"

40:16.790 --> 40:19.380
it's non-attributable,
they can't find

40:19.500 --> 40:22.210
the origin of that word.

40:22.340 --> 40:25.550
NARRATOR: The word "dog"
is one of the strangest

40:25.680 --> 40:30.390
in the English language, because
no one knows where it came from.

40:30.510 --> 40:35.270
English is mostly derived
from German, Latin, and French.

40:35.390 --> 40:38.560
The German word for dog
is "hund,"

40:38.690 --> 40:43.440
the Latin word is "canis,"
and the French word is "chien."

40:43.570 --> 40:47.740
So where do we get "dog"?

40:47.860 --> 40:51.080
Is it possible that some being
from the Dog Star

40:51.200 --> 40:53.040
or from this system

40:53.160 --> 40:57.290
gave that type of vocabulary
of Dagon, Dogon, dogu,

40:57.420 --> 41:00.290
and all of these similarities
are speaking of one race

41:00.420 --> 41:02.460
that visited ancient man?

41:03.630 --> 41:05.800
I think in this particular case,

41:05.920 --> 41:08.300
whatever came down here
at the time,

41:08.430 --> 41:11.260
or what group
of extraterrestrials

41:11.390 --> 41:14.640
came down here at the time,
they were referred to as this,

41:14.770 --> 41:16.140
and then other civilizations

41:16.270 --> 41:19.310
just carried it
and picked up on it.

41:19.440 --> 41:22.690
We have to at least ask
the question, is this, in fact,

41:22.820 --> 41:26.110
the name of these god beings?
I believe it is.

41:26.240 --> 41:31.280
NARRATOR: Is it possible that ancient
statues unearthed in West Africa

41:31.410 --> 41:35.950
represent the opening chapter
in the story of humankind?

41:36.080 --> 41:39.750
Do they depict advanced beings
that traveled to our planet

41:39.870 --> 41:42.920
from the Sirius star system
to create the first humans

41:43.040 --> 41:46.880
and ignite civilization
on Earth?

41:47.010 --> 41:50.260
And did these extraterrestrials
leave behind evidence

41:50.390 --> 41:54.890
of their visitation
for future generations to find?

41:55.020 --> 41:59.440
Perhaps these clues point
not only to their home planet

41:59.560 --> 42:03.980
but to where we must travel
in order to reunite

42:04.110 --> 42:06.860
with our alien ancestors.
