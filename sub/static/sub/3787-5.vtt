00:01.501 --> 00:04.203
I'm Max.
I'll be your waitress,

00:04.205 --> 00:06.805
'cause they don't do
background checks here.

00:06.807 --> 00:08.140
Oh, you'll
be our waitress.

00:08.141 --> 00:09.975
I never guessed
that based on the uniform

00:09.977 --> 00:13.846
and name tag
that says "Max."

00:13.848 --> 00:16.882
You know I make,
like, $3, right?

00:16.884 --> 00:19.284
I realize that's a lot
of money in the 1920s

00:19.286 --> 00:21.920
where you two are from.

00:21.922 --> 00:25.024
Here, open this
and bring us two clean glasses.

00:25.026 --> 00:27.860
Sure, not-so-great gatsby.

00:29.429 --> 00:31.363
Hey, oj and Nicole.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.635
Rude snobs at table ten.
You know what that means.

00:36.637 --> 00:39.371
Wine swap?
- Let's roll.

00:41.007 --> 00:43.442
Hey, Oleg,
I need one of those $2 merlots

00:43.444 --> 00:46.645
you get from your cousin
with the hole in his neck.

00:46.647 --> 00:48.047
Caroline, price check.

00:48.049 --> 00:52.551
Oh! Chateau pavie, 2008.
Very expensive.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.119
But, hey,
we deserve it.

00:55.622 --> 00:57.056
Here, better
let it breathe.

00:57.058 --> 00:59.425
It was in my gym bag.

01:00.827 --> 01:02.027
Not a problem.

01:02.029 --> 01:04.962
This vintage pairs well
with jockstrap.

01:04.965 --> 01:07.699
Do you think waitresses
did this to me when I had money?

01:07.701 --> 01:09.568
Only if you had
an attitude.

01:09.570 --> 01:12.304
(Both)
So that's a yes.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.440
I can't remember
if this reminds me

01:14.442 --> 01:18.010
of an old heist movie I saw
on an old heist

01:18.012 --> 01:20.345
I actually participated in.

01:20.347 --> 01:24.149
I know.
We're like ocean's 7/11.

01:24.151 --> 01:25.984
All we're missing
is a tiny Asian guy

01:25.986 --> 01:27.719
who can fit
into small boxes.

01:27.721 --> 01:30.823
Hello.

01:30.825 --> 01:33.192
Table ten is looking
for their wine.

01:33.194 --> 01:36.061
Oh, not a problem.
Coming right up.

01:36.063 --> 01:38.831
What did you do?
Why is she smiling?

01:38.833 --> 01:42.201
Are my pants on fire again?

01:42.203 --> 01:44.503
(peter bjorn and John)
¶ ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ¶

01:44.505 --> 01:45.904
[cash register bell dings]

01:45.906 --> 01:49.908
¶ Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ¶

01:55.782 --> 01:57.216
[metal clanks, mouse squeaks]

01:57.218 --> 01:59.318
Oh, yeah,
take that, sucker!

01:59.320 --> 02:00.552
[Mouse squeaking]
Max, when I said

02:00.554 --> 02:02.387
we need to move
the cupcakes,

02:02.389 --> 02:05.190
I didn't mean through the air
at a rodent's head.

02:05.192 --> 02:08.160
Hey, he ran up the window,

02:08.162 --> 02:11.330
so it's kind of
a stand-your-ground situation.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.265
[Metal clanks, mouse squeaks]

02:13.267 --> 02:17.102
Okay, we're on a time-out.
He's eating my ammo.

02:17.104 --> 02:19.071
Max, business
is down again,

02:19.073 --> 02:20.973
and the only phrase
I've said more than that is,

02:20.975 --> 02:23.242
"please, god,
take me in my sleep."

02:23.244 --> 02:25.477
I mean, it's clear.
Not getting ahead.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.313
Oh, is that what
your mood is about?

02:28.315 --> 02:30.616
You're not getting
any ahead?

02:30.618 --> 02:33.085
'Cause I can take care
of that with one call.

02:33.087 --> 02:34.520
You are not hooking me up
with that guy

02:34.522 --> 02:38.624
who's listed in your phone
as "oral redenbacher."

02:40.126 --> 02:41.493
Max, this
is our future.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.762
We need to get serious
about making money.

02:43.764 --> 02:47.132
Absolutely.
Let's leave early.

02:47.134 --> 02:50.435
Leave early?
Who are we, congress?

02:50.437 --> 02:52.738
Do you think other
business got successful

02:52.740 --> 02:53.972
by leaving early?

02:53.974 --> 02:55.607
No, they did it
by hiring illegals

02:55.609 --> 02:59.945
and moving their
bank accounts offshore.

02:59.947 --> 03:01.146
We can't leave early.

03:01.148 --> 03:03.081
The sign says
"open till 2:00 A.M."

03:03.083 --> 03:07.419
Well, I'm open to getting
a new sign that says "closed."

03:07.421 --> 03:09.321
I mean, are we supposed
to just hang around here

03:09.323 --> 03:12.658
and wait for whatever nut jobs
are trolling around town?

03:12.660 --> 03:14.459
Hi, girls.

03:16.462 --> 03:18.530
Guess what Oleg and I
are going to do

03:18.532 --> 03:21.466
that will probably
give me hep c.

03:21.468 --> 03:24.603
A three way
with Tommy Lee?

03:24.605 --> 03:28.574
No, silly.
We're getting matching tattoos.

03:28.576 --> 03:31.510
We want something that
represents our relationship.

03:31.512 --> 03:34.112
So maybe two butterflies
doing the nasty

03:34.114 --> 03:36.582
during "CSI: Miami."

03:36.584 --> 03:38.784
Wow, you two,
his and her tats.

03:38.786 --> 03:42.254
Romantic and will help
identify the bodies.

03:42.256 --> 03:45.123
Sure, you know,
matching tattoos

03:45.125 --> 03:48.060
are the deepest expression
of commitment.

03:48.062 --> 03:49.494
Well, matching tattoos

03:49.496 --> 03:53.498
and pooping in front
of each other.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.734
I'm not gonna do it
in front of my man.

03:55.736 --> 04:00.706
I poop at McDonald's
'cause I'm a lady.

04:00.708 --> 04:03.175
Thanks for the cupcake.

04:03.177 --> 04:05.410
We really have
to start charging her.

04:05.412 --> 04:09.214
Charge her with what,
first-degree man-settling?

04:09.216 --> 04:11.650
Max, as I was saying,
it's time to get serious

04:11.652 --> 04:12.684
about the business.

04:12.686 --> 04:15.387
Absolutely.
Let's leave early.

04:15.389 --> 04:17.289
What? Last night
after 1:00,

04:17.291 --> 04:19.458
we made
only $15, right?

04:19.459 --> 04:21.860
$14.63.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.428
What? Math is
my thing.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.230
Would you roll your eyes
if you were standing

04:25.232 --> 04:28.166
across from eminem
and he started rapping?

04:28.168 --> 04:30.869
Uh, yes.

04:30.871 --> 04:34.573
I'd be all, "dude, you're 60.
Sit on a porch swing."

04:36.142 --> 04:37.843
Okay, look,
here is $15.

04:37.845 --> 04:40.212
That'll cover
what we'll probably make.

04:40.214 --> 04:41.647
I'm leaving.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.348
You're just gonna
leave me here?

04:43.350 --> 04:45.284
Yup, I'm leaving as soon
as I get my change back

04:45.286 --> 04:47.686
from that $14.63.

04:47.688 --> 04:50.756
Fine, just tell me
how much that is.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.791
Or maybe sooner.

04:55.662 --> 04:58.697
This is a very
big day for me.

04:58.699 --> 05:01.099
Why, because of this
totally out-of-the-blue order

05:01.101 --> 05:03.268
we got to do cupcakes
for this business seminar?

05:03.270 --> 05:05.971
No, the first time
I've entered a Sheridan

05:05.973 --> 05:08.340
through a door.

05:08.342 --> 05:11.376
Usually it's by window
or freight elevator.

05:11.378 --> 05:13.912
And one time, I rolled in
under some girl's

05:13.914 --> 05:16.281
quinceañera dress.

05:16.283 --> 05:17.949
The seminar's
about to start.

05:17.951 --> 05:21.753
I have unclaimed name tags
for Pamela, Ellen...

05:21.755 --> 05:23.855
What kind of losers
would come to this?

05:23.857 --> 05:26.658
Max, Caroline.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.760
I wouldn't
call us losers.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.128
Are you here?

05:30.130 --> 05:32.698
Okay, so there
is no cupcake order.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.599
I signed us up
for this seminar.

05:34.601 --> 05:38.470
I carried cupcakes
on a subway for nothing?

05:38.472 --> 05:43.208
The annoying woman next
to me talked the whole time.

05:43.210 --> 05:47.346
I was sitting
next to you, Max.

05:47.348 --> 05:49.314
Look, I knew you wouldn't
come otherwise,

05:49.316 --> 05:51.216
and you need to be here.

05:51.218 --> 05:53.318
This is a business
intervention.

05:53.320 --> 05:56.355
It's not an intervention.

05:56.357 --> 05:58.290
Max, your behavior lately
has affected me

05:58.292 --> 06:01.526
in the following ways.

06:01.528 --> 06:02.828
I can't believe this.

06:02.830 --> 06:05.764
At least in my other
interventions I was drunk.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.733
We need
to do this seminar.

06:07.735 --> 06:09.368
Gordon kepper
is a genius.

06:09.370 --> 06:11.336
He's gonna give our business
a real bump.

06:11.338 --> 06:13.472
Guys giving me a bump
is why they threw me

06:13.474 --> 06:16.174
that second
intervention.

06:16.176 --> 06:17.442
Let's go.

06:17.444 --> 06:19.578
Oh, mm, okay.
See you.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.313
So this is
your new thing, Max?

06:21.315 --> 06:22.614
You're just
gonna walk out on me?

06:22.616 --> 06:24.449
Actually, it's
an old thing.

06:24.451 --> 06:27.285
In fact, it's kind
of a family tradition.

06:27.287 --> 06:31.123
I learned from my father,
whoever he is.

06:31.125 --> 06:33.392
Come on.
It's just two days.

06:33.394 --> 06:35.727
Two days?
No way.

06:35.729 --> 06:36.762
No freaking way.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.397
There's a buffet
and a dessert bar.

06:38.399 --> 06:39.865
Ooh, okay.

06:41.334 --> 06:43.068
Wait here, I'll go pay.
I brought some cash.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.370
And they'll take an expired
target gift card, right?

06:45.372 --> 06:47.739
Oh, we are
not paying.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.808
Here.
Here, Pamela.

06:49.810 --> 06:52.511
Follow Ellen
to the freight elevator.

06:52.513 --> 06:54.679
No way, Max.
We are not sneaking in.

06:54.681 --> 06:57.349
How much
is this thing?
- $1,000.

06:57.351 --> 06:59.718
We're sneaking
in, Ellen.

07:03.723 --> 07:05.157
Now, you all
are here today

07:05.159 --> 07:07.292
not only to find out
what you are as a business

07:07.294 --> 07:10.095
but to find out
who you are.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.264
I'm a lady hoping
there's macaroni and cheese

07:12.266 --> 07:13.865
at that buffet.

07:13.867 --> 07:16.101
Who are you
is your brand,

07:16.103 --> 07:17.769
and saying that a brand
is simply a name

07:17.771 --> 07:21.807
is like saying Abraham Lincoln
is simply a name,

07:21.809 --> 07:25.777
or mahatma Gandhi, god.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.346
Who does this guy
think he is?

07:28.348 --> 07:31.349
I'm sure you're wondering,
"who does this guy think he is?"

07:33.453 --> 07:34.820
Okay, that was weird.

07:34.822 --> 07:37.823
Or maybe
this seems weird.

07:39.158 --> 07:41.026
I've got chills.

07:41.028 --> 07:42.260
When it comes to business,

07:42.262 --> 07:43.762
people come up to me
all the time.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.597
They say,
"Gordon, business is hard,

07:45.599 --> 07:47.732
but I do what I can."

07:47.734 --> 07:50.035
And they shrug.
Now, is that the right attitude?

07:50.037 --> 07:52.904
(All)
No.
- Yes.

07:52.906 --> 07:56.741
To those people,
I say, "don't do what you can.

07:56.743 --> 07:58.043
Can what you do."

07:58.045 --> 08:00.412
don't do what you can.

08:00.414 --> 08:02.247
Can what you do!
Get it?

08:02.249 --> 08:03.381
Do you get it?

08:03.383 --> 08:05.750
(All)
Yes.
- No.

08:05.752 --> 08:07.853
You did not get it.
Shh.

08:07.855 --> 08:09.721
All right, everybody,
reach under your chairs

08:09.723 --> 08:10.922
and pick up
what you find there.

08:10.924 --> 08:13.758
Hope it's a way
out of here.

08:15.728 --> 08:17.062
Koosh balls?

08:17.064 --> 08:19.965
Inside those cans,
you will find the key

08:19.967 --> 08:21.533
to success
in your business.

08:21.535 --> 08:24.002
Not unless the key
is Rosie O'Donnell's career

08:24.004 --> 08:27.239
before her buzz cut.

08:27.241 --> 08:28.807
Truth.

08:28.809 --> 08:30.642
That's the big secret
to business.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.711
If people buy
what you're saying,

08:32.712 --> 08:34.946
they will buy
what you're selling.

08:34.948 --> 08:38.183
Max, stay alert.
This could go to cult like that.

08:38.184 --> 08:40.385
I like to think of those things
you're holding

08:40.386 --> 08:44.222
as my truth balls.

08:48.060 --> 08:52.063
Screw this.
Let's get to the meatballs.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.798
Anytime in the next
two days,

08:53.800 --> 08:55.534
one of you is up here
selling you something

08:55.536 --> 08:57.802
that you feel is just bull,

08:57.804 --> 08:59.671
then toss it--

08:59.673 --> 09:00.705
Max!

09:00.707 --> 09:03.642
I mean, Ellen!

09:03.644 --> 09:06.878
Yeah, baby.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.648
That is what
I'm talking about.

09:09.650 --> 09:10.949
Whoever threw that
is not afraid

09:10.951 --> 09:11.983
to really go for it,

09:11.985 --> 09:13.718
and that will go
a long way

09:13.720 --> 09:15.387
toward success
in business.

09:15.389 --> 09:17.689
All right, cool, but it is
a long way to the buffet?

09:17.691 --> 09:19.991
'Cause I am starving.

09:21.894 --> 09:23.395
Okay, everyone.

09:23.397 --> 09:25.497
Consider these small groups
you've broken into

09:25.499 --> 09:27.132
as little think tanks.

09:27.134 --> 09:30.368
I need you to work together
and bring out your very best.

09:30.370 --> 09:31.570
[Snores]

09:31.572 --> 09:33.305
Max!

09:33.307 --> 09:34.506
don't blame me.

09:34.508 --> 09:36.875
Blame the heavy cream
at the fettuccini bar.

09:36.877 --> 09:41.112
Alfredo must be Italian
for "roofie."

09:41.114 --> 09:43.248
So, Ellen,
tell us what you have,

09:43.250 --> 09:46.184
and I'll tell you
what we think.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.686
Oh, Ellen.
That's you.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.721
Oh, oh, yes, yes,
that's me.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.690
I'm Ellen.
Definitely an Ellen.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.558
See, I dance.

09:57.530 --> 09:58.930
Okay.

10:00.666 --> 10:04.603
Okay.
Okay, now it's weird.

10:04.605 --> 10:06.571
So, Ellen...

10:08.140 --> 10:10.108
Let's hear your b.B.B.--

10:10.110 --> 10:13.311
your brilliant
business brand.

10:13.313 --> 10:14.346
Uh...

10:14.348 --> 10:15.347
[Chuckles]

10:15.349 --> 10:16.648
[Stammers]

10:16.650 --> 10:19.184
I-I don't do the talking.
Pamela does the talking.

10:19.186 --> 10:20.452
Pam?
- Thanks, Ellen.

10:20.454 --> 10:25.156
Hello, everyone,
my name is Pam panning,

10:25.158 --> 10:27.492
and what my partner, Ellen,
was trying to say is,

10:27.494 --> 10:30.462
we making very beautiful
artisan cupcakes.

10:30.464 --> 10:32.397
Yeah, but they're
still cool.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.299
I never said
they weren't cool.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.501
Yeah, mm, maybe they just
didn't sound cool

10:36.503 --> 10:39.904
coming out of your face.

10:39.906 --> 10:41.673
I'm sorry,
but at least actual words

10:41.675 --> 10:44.242
are better than,
"uh, uh-uh, uh..."

10:44.244 --> 10:46.077
Ladies, hold.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.612
Sometimes in business

10:47.614 --> 10:51.716
parents' ships will sail
in two different directions,

10:51.718 --> 10:53.718
so you two need to find out
if you're gonna continue

10:53.720 --> 10:57.055
to sail apart
or if you're gonna change course

10:57.057 --> 11:01.059
and reconvene at the port
of mutual understanding.

11:01.061 --> 11:03.361
Well, we can't sail
too far apart

11:03.363 --> 11:05.163
'cause I'm definitely
gonna have to explain

11:05.165 --> 11:08.500
what you just said to her.

11:08.502 --> 11:09.901
I got it.

11:09.903 --> 11:13.405
I'm a boat, and I'm trying
to get away from you.

11:13.407 --> 11:16.408
Sounds right to me.

11:16.410 --> 11:17.542
Think it over.

11:17.544 --> 11:19.844
Talk it over
with your first mate.

11:19.846 --> 11:22.614
[Snickers]

11:22.616 --> 11:23.882
Come back tomorrow

11:23.884 --> 11:26.017
and tell me
who your business is,

11:26.019 --> 11:27.686
and I'll help guide you
toward that purpose.

11:27.688 --> 11:30.555
And remember,
you can't purpose without--

11:30.557 --> 11:33.124
puss.
- Okay, wow.

11:33.126 --> 11:36.161
Gordon, her boat's kind
of in shallow water right now,

11:36.163 --> 11:38.096
but we're gonna go away,
get it together,

11:38.098 --> 11:39.998
and come back
and blow you away.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.133
And you can't spell
"blow you away" without--

11:42.135 --> 11:43.568
our ship's leaving.

11:47.573 --> 11:48.773
Oh, hello.

11:48.775 --> 11:50.508
Welcome to
the williamsburg diner.

11:50.510 --> 11:55.947
Can I get you anything,
like a work ethic?

11:55.949 --> 11:58.583
Han, this is adorable,
but we're busy.

11:58.585 --> 12:00.418
We're pitching
our business brand tomorrow,

12:00.420 --> 12:02.220
and Max and I need to get
on the same page.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.621
Yeah, we don't want
to work here

12:03.623 --> 12:05.223
the rest of our lives.

12:05.225 --> 12:08.493
Well, now we're all
on the same page.

12:08.495 --> 12:09.961
Han, just give us
ten minutes.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.229
Then we'll get to work.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.430
Well, I've waited
four years.

12:12.432 --> 12:14.132
What's another
ten minutes?

12:15.501 --> 12:17.469
Max, I have to say
I was a little thrown

12:17.471 --> 12:19.137
by that thing
you said today.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.039
What, that the best sex
I've ever had

12:21.041 --> 12:23.708
was alone
on the tilt-a-whirl?

12:23.710 --> 12:27.045
No, why would that throw me?
You say that every day.

12:27.047 --> 12:29.581
No, that thing about me
not sounding cool.

12:29.583 --> 12:32.984
Why would that throw you?
I say it every day.

12:32.986 --> 12:35.420
Yes, but not about
the business.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.589
So what was it?
The word "artisan"?

12:37.591 --> 12:43.261
Okay, first of all,
it sounds like fart-isan,

12:43.263 --> 12:47.031
as in, "a fart is
in this room right now."

12:47.033 --> 12:51.035
Somebody finally
called you out on it, Caroline.

12:53.239 --> 12:55.273
So I was thinking
our slogan could be,

12:55.275 --> 12:58.777
"Max's homemade cupcakes.
Sugar and spice."

12:58.779 --> 13:01.446
I'd rather go
with fart-isan.

13:01.448 --> 13:02.580
Really, beavis?

13:02.582 --> 13:05.850
What does your business partner
butthead think?

13:05.852 --> 13:07.252
Our business
isn't working.

13:07.254 --> 13:09.154
Well, guess who
is working.

13:09.156 --> 13:11.089
Me, the damn owner.

13:13.492 --> 13:14.559
Why are you surprised?

13:14.561 --> 13:16.594
You know how many cupcakes
were not selling.

13:16.596 --> 13:19.063
I mean, you're secretly
eating at least six a night

13:19.065 --> 13:20.932
to make me think
we're selling more.

13:20.934 --> 13:24.536
Also 'cause I'm sad.

13:24.538 --> 13:27.839
Look, I know you went
to wharton and all, but--

13:27.841 --> 13:29.607
wait...

13:29.609 --> 13:31.276
What's happening?

13:31.278 --> 13:35.113
Is this a business
intervention on me?

13:35.115 --> 13:36.548
From someone
who pronounces

13:36.550 --> 13:40.518
the word business
"bidness"?

13:40.520 --> 13:42.487
Why are you giving me
the big eye-painting face?

13:42.489 --> 13:44.222
You knew the business
wasn't working.

13:44.224 --> 13:46.357
Well, I don't hear you
coming up with any ideas.

13:46.359 --> 13:47.992
That's 'cause
you don't listen.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.727
Remember when I said
we should stop making

13:49.729 --> 13:50.895
all these flowery cupcakes

13:50.897 --> 13:52.397
and just make ones
that say mean things

13:52.399 --> 13:55.066
like "eat it"
and "lick me"?

13:55.068 --> 13:57.902
Your big business plan
is cupcakes

13:57.904 --> 13:59.938
that say "eat it"
and "lick me"?

13:59.940 --> 14:02.207
And other funny things
like "loser"

14:02.209 --> 14:04.242
or "eat your feelings."

14:04.244 --> 14:06.344
Hmm, why not just shoot people
in the face

14:06.346 --> 14:08.112
when they come
to the window?

14:08.114 --> 14:10.081
And I thought the back
of our t-shirt

14:10.083 --> 14:14.419
could just say,
"cream filled."

14:14.421 --> 14:17.622
So funny if, like,
a hot girl was wearing it.

14:17.624 --> 14:21.893
And even funnier
if it was a fat guy.

14:21.895 --> 14:24.495
Okay, maybe like
Gordon said,

14:24.497 --> 14:27.365
our partner ships are going
in different directions.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.267
My sugar and spice ship
is going one way,

14:29.269 --> 14:31.035
and your mean
and ugly booze cruise

14:31.037 --> 14:32.537
is going another.

14:32.539 --> 14:35.273
So how about tomorrow,
I'll sail my ship,

14:35.275 --> 14:37.709
and you can
sail yours, Ellen.

14:37.711 --> 14:38.910
Done.

14:38.912 --> 14:41.479
And, Pam, I know
you think your ship don't sink,

14:41.481 --> 14:44.182
but it does.

14:48.420 --> 14:52.357
So, Hannah, Todd, go.

14:52.359 --> 14:55.894
Tell us,
who is your business?

14:55.896 --> 14:59.397
We make
guitar case suitcases.

14:59.399 --> 15:04.035
Yeah, they're suitcases
that look like guitar cases

15:04.037 --> 15:07.705
so you can look cool
at the airport.

15:07.707 --> 15:09.307
So far,
no truth balls.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.743
That means we believe
you're telling some truth

15:11.745 --> 15:12.977
of who you are.

15:12.979 --> 15:15.580
Business is always--

15:15.582 --> 15:16.748
okay then.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.149
So what,
their big idea

15:18.151 --> 15:20.318
is just throwing your crap
in a guitar case?

15:20.320 --> 15:23.288
Well, it's
no fart-isan cupcake.

15:23.290 --> 15:26.057
Todd, Hannah, did you get
together with our graphic artist

15:26.059 --> 15:27.358
to help create a logo?

15:27.360 --> 15:28.626
Yes, we did.

15:28.628 --> 15:31.129
We stayed up all night,
and to be honest,

15:31.131 --> 15:34.732
it got kind of weird.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.234
That's our logo,

15:36.236 --> 15:41.172
and our company's called
"I'm with the band."

15:43.542 --> 15:45.376
Back off!

15:45.378 --> 15:49.047
She just got
out of rehab.

15:49.049 --> 15:51.683
Business is not
for the faint of heart

15:51.685 --> 15:54.786
or coke addicts.

15:54.788 --> 15:56.154
Next up, we've got
Ellen and Pam.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.089
Let's give 'em
some love.

15:58.091 --> 15:59.757
Max, you're really not
gonna go up there

15:59.759 --> 16:01.225
and sell your idea
as a business plan.

16:01.227 --> 16:04.696
Yup, and I feel
pretty good about it.

16:04.698 --> 16:06.965
Okay, well, then I hope
you enjoy lots of balls

16:06.967 --> 16:08.099
in your face.

16:08.101 --> 16:09.867
If I didn't
at burning man,

16:09.869 --> 16:12.704
I doubt I will here.

16:12.706 --> 16:13.705
Gordon, hi.

16:13.707 --> 16:15.239
As you predicted,

16:15.241 --> 16:16.708
today we'll be presenting
our brands separately.

16:16.710 --> 16:19.978
Okay, looks like
we have us a brand off, folks.

16:19.980 --> 16:21.512
This is exciting.

16:21.514 --> 16:26.150
I am feeling it!

16:26.152 --> 16:28.152
Ellen, I know you're not
used to being alone.

16:28.154 --> 16:31.856
Neither was I,
hence wife number three.

16:31.858 --> 16:33.191
don't rush.

16:33.193 --> 16:36.027
Take some time
to get yourself centered.

16:36.029 --> 16:38.696
Yo, yo, yo!
What's happening, Sheridan!

16:38.698 --> 16:39.964
Ellen in the house.

16:39.966 --> 16:42.300
Let me hear some noise.

16:42.302 --> 16:44.302
Yeah. Oh!
All right, all right.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.971
We got some haters.
That's cool.

16:46.973 --> 16:48.940
Ellen, did you design
a logo?

16:48.942 --> 16:52.844
Sure did.
Show it, player.

16:52.846 --> 16:55.680
George, she's talking
to you.

16:57.049 --> 16:58.716
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Oh, good impact.</i>

16:58.718 --> 17:00.451
Boom, cupcake business.

17:00.453 --> 17:01.486
But, um...

17:01.488 --> 17:03.421
Where's the name
of your business.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.823
Oh, I didn't want one.

17:05.825 --> 17:08.492
I just wanted it
to be cool.

17:10.194 --> 17:11.596
So let me
get this correct.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.830
You want to make t-shirts
for your business

17:13.833 --> 17:15.767
with no business connection.

17:15.769 --> 17:17.167
Okay.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.904
This is your journey,
but it might end here.

17:19.906 --> 17:22.607
No, no, no, see,
it's a cupcake,

17:22.608 --> 17:28.579
and we sell cupcakes,
so that's the "bidness."

17:28.581 --> 17:31.616
Okay, you know what?
Screw this!

17:31.618 --> 17:35.420
That t-shirt is way cool,
and if you can't see it,

17:35.422 --> 17:40.825
this seminar is so not worth
the $1,000 I paid.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.527
Peace out.

17:42.529 --> 17:45.430
[Feedback whines]

17:45.432 --> 17:49.634
In business,
we call that a meltdown.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.069
It happens.

17:51.071 --> 17:54.005
So why don't we bring up
Ellen's former partner Pam.

17:54.007 --> 17:55.940
Let's give Pam
a round of applause.

17:55.942 --> 17:57.909
Max, I don't have
to go up there.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.143
Come on,
we can just leave.

17:59.145 --> 18:00.478
Oh, look who wants

18:00.480 --> 18:02.647
to pack up
their guitar suitcase and go.

18:02.649 --> 18:03.681
You know what?

18:03.683 --> 18:05.249
I was only leaving
'cause you failed.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.251
I believe
in my ideas.

18:09.054 --> 18:11.155
Good afternoon.
Hello, hi.

18:11.157 --> 18:13.357
I represent
Max's homemade cupcakes.

18:13.359 --> 18:15.093
(Gordon)
I'm gonna stop you
right there.

18:15.095 --> 18:16.894
Why Max's cupcakes?

18:16.896 --> 18:18.996
Why not Ellen's
or Pam's?

18:18.998 --> 18:20.665
Well, um...

18:20.667 --> 18:24.836
Max was--Max is
this very special person

18:24.838 --> 18:27.972
and the inspiration
behind our whole business.

18:27.974 --> 18:29.140
<i>Got it.</i>

18:29.142 --> 18:30.408
So Max is
an emotional touchstone

18:30.410 --> 18:31.943
for you
and your business.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.744
Yes.

18:33.746 --> 18:34.912
<i>Valid.</i>
<i>Go on.</i>

18:34.914 --> 18:36.114
Great.

18:36.116 --> 18:38.749
So the logo--

18:38.751 --> 18:41.719
George.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.654
This is our current
company logo,

18:43.656 --> 18:45.356
and I feel
it works just fine.

18:45.358 --> 18:49.026
I mean, if it ain't broke,
don't fix it, right?

18:49.028 --> 18:51.229
<i>Okay.</i>

18:51.231 --> 18:54.232
Well, the cupcake
shows a mix of sweet imagery

18:54.234 --> 18:58.069
because we're two girls trying
to retro-repurpose the phrase

18:58.071 --> 19:02.039
"sugar and spice
and everything nice."

19:02.041 --> 19:03.841
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

19:03.843 --> 19:05.176
Leave Pam alone!

19:05.178 --> 19:06.611
I'm fine, Ellen.

19:06.613 --> 19:08.479
They can't shut me down,
because I believe in us

19:08.481 --> 19:10.882
and our special brand
of artisan cupcakes.

19:10.884 --> 19:13.384
Why?

19:20.492 --> 19:21.492
Give me!

19:21.494 --> 19:25.163
Eat it, you losers!
Eat it, eat it!

19:25.165 --> 19:28.232
I see the truth balls
have stopped.

19:28.234 --> 19:31.869
It looks like "eat it, eat it,
you losers,"

19:31.871 --> 19:35.873
might just be your brand.

19:35.875 --> 19:39.477
You two are a combination
of sugar and spice

19:39.479 --> 19:41.612
and things not so nice.

19:41.614 --> 19:45.449
Speaking of truth, I need you
to pay Sandra for the seminar.

19:45.451 --> 19:47.418
As much as I admire
your pluck,

19:47.420 --> 19:51.222
12 trips to the pasta bar
aren't free.

19:51.224 --> 19:53.191
Come on, Pam.
Yeah, let's go, Ellen.

19:53.193 --> 19:54.759
I'm Ellen.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.601
Guess what I have
under my coat.

20:03.603 --> 20:07.104
Well, I know
it's not a boob reduction.

20:07.106 --> 20:08.706
What do you think?
Cool, huh?

20:08.708 --> 20:11.008
Aw, man, somebody
already makes that?

20:11.010 --> 20:12.476
Oh, bummer.

20:12.478 --> 20:14.946
This is like when I thought
I invented chip-wiches.

20:14.948 --> 20:17.982
Should've known.
I was eating one at the time.

20:17.984 --> 20:19.817
No, Max, this is
your shirt.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.686
I got the rendering
from the seminar

20:21.688 --> 20:22.720
and had it made it

20:22.722 --> 20:25.089
we can make anything
in under an hour.

20:25.091 --> 20:26.591
You know, that place
under the bridge

20:26.593 --> 20:30.061
near the underage bar
where you got under arrest.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.462
<i>[Gasps]</i>
<i>No way.</i>

20:31.464 --> 20:33.231
Oh, no way.
That's hot.

20:33.233 --> 20:35.233
I know, and a girl
at the place

20:35.235 --> 20:37.068
asked me
where she could get one.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.302
Really?

20:38.304 --> 20:41.606
Kind of in love
with myself right now.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.674
Hey, what made you change
your mind about the t-shirts?

20:43.676 --> 20:45.343
Well, one of the things
I learned at wharton

20:45.345 --> 20:47.445
is that success depends
on staying open

20:47.447 --> 20:50.047
to a better idea,
even if it's not yours.

20:50.049 --> 20:52.083
Aw.
- And here.

20:52.085 --> 20:54.151
I thought you'd
rather a black one.

20:54.153 --> 20:56.487
On tinder and in life.
