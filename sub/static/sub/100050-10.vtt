WEBVTT

00:08.660 --> 00:10.488
Previously onYoung Sheldon...I saw Connie

00:10.532 --> 00:12.186
for the first time since
I broke up with her,

00:12.229 --> 00:14.449
and it's making me wonder
if she also

00:14.492 --> 00:18.844
is feeling lonely, and I made
a bad decision for both of us.

00:18.888 --> 00:20.933
I hate to be the one
to tell you this, John,

00:20.977 --> 00:23.066
but she's kind of been seeing
someone new.

00:23.110 --> 00:24.502
She seems to be doing okay.

00:24.546 --> 00:27.723
Oh, I hope he gets lost
at sea and never returns!

00:29.072 --> 00:31.379
I'm having a
lot of feelings.

00:31.422 --> 00:34.034
Hey.Connie.

00:34.077 --> 00:36.732
I thought I'd just,
uh... say "hi."

00:36.775 --> 00:39.082
Would it be awkward
if I asked her to join us?

00:39.126 --> 00:41.650
Oh, couldn't be
any moreawkward.

00:44.827 --> 00:46.350
ADULT SHELDON:
In many ways,

00:46.394 --> 00:49.092
a high school is like
an academic house of horrors.

00:50.528 --> 00:52.052
There's the cafeteria,

00:52.095 --> 00:53.662
which when even
freshly cleaned,

00:53.705 --> 00:57.840
maintains a subtle aroma of
tater tots and throw-up.

00:57.883 --> 00:59.972
The schoolyard,
where one is exposed

01:00.016 --> 01:02.236
to bullying by delinquents
and attacks from above

01:02.279 --> 01:04.629
by eye-pecking demons.

01:08.111 --> 01:10.679
But all of these pale
in comparison

01:10.722 --> 01:13.247
to the most horrific location
of all.

01:13.290 --> 01:17.207
A place teeming with the sweat
and secretions

01:17.251 --> 01:19.905
from hundreds
of unwashed bodies.

01:19.949 --> 01:22.778
The swimming pool.

01:22.821 --> 01:24.823
Sorry, Sheldon.
Water safety is a required

01:24.867 --> 01:26.564
part of your P.E. class.

01:26.608 --> 01:28.218
But other kids
use that pool.

01:28.262 --> 01:31.178
It's basically a big
bowl of teenager soup.

01:31.221 --> 01:34.268
It's out of my hands.
It's a state requirement.

01:34.311 --> 01:37.140
If you don't like it, take it up
with your congressman.

01:37.184 --> 01:38.794
I did.

01:38.837 --> 01:40.187
He won't return my calls.

01:42.232 --> 01:44.756
Then I guess
you're swimming tomorrow.

01:52.286 --> 01:54.157
ADULT SHELDON:
Except for the laughter,
the glowing eyes

01:54.201 --> 01:57.552
and the lightning, that's exactly how it happened.

01:57.595 --> 02:00.468
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

02:00.511 --> 02:02.774
♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain

02:02.818 --> 02:06.169
♪ I bet I could be your hero

02:06.213 --> 02:08.867
♪ I am a mighty little man

02:08.911 --> 02:12.567
♪ I am a mighty little man.♪

02:17.137 --> 02:18.181
I'm a little nervous.

02:18.225 --> 02:19.878
You're the first ex-girlfriend

02:19.922 --> 02:21.924
I've ever been friends with.

02:21.967 --> 02:24.187
And you're also
my first ex-girlfriend.

02:24.231 --> 02:25.580
And that's because you...

02:25.623 --> 02:29.149
How about you just think of me
as your friend?

02:29.192 --> 02:32.282
Okay. Yes, that's good.

02:32.326 --> 02:34.719
So, I understand

02:34.763 --> 02:36.765
you're seeing someone new.

02:36.808 --> 02:39.333
Tell me everything.

02:39.376 --> 02:40.769
No!

02:40.812 --> 02:43.641
I assumed that, uh, as friends,

02:43.685 --> 02:46.340
we could tell each other
about our personal lives.

02:46.383 --> 02:49.517
Trust me, John, you-you don't
want to hear about these things.

02:49.560 --> 02:51.171
Actually, I do.

02:51.214 --> 02:53.825
Your happiness is
very important to me.

02:53.869 --> 02:56.001
Oh, what the hell.

02:56.045 --> 02:58.003
His name is Dale.

02:58.047 --> 02:59.962
He owns a sporting
goods store.

03:00.005 --> 03:01.616
And we've only been
out a few times,

03:01.659 --> 03:03.748
but so far, so good.

03:03.792 --> 03:05.315
Well, that sounds wonderful.

03:05.359 --> 03:06.969
Good for you.

03:07.012 --> 03:08.188
Thank you.

03:08.231 --> 03:09.885
Now, would you like to hear

03:09.928 --> 03:11.495
about the women I'm dating?

03:11.539 --> 03:13.193
You're dating other women?

03:14.629 --> 03:16.935
Heavens, no.

03:16.979 --> 03:20.112
Come on, Jesus. This is
for your birthday. Help me out.

03:20.156 --> 03:24.508
Boy, Sheldon is really worked up
about this whole swimming thing.

03:24.552 --> 03:26.771
Don't you think he should learn
for his own safety?

03:26.815 --> 03:29.513
You really think he's ever
gonna go near a body of water?

03:29.557 --> 03:31.254
Yeah. It's only a matter of time

03:31.298 --> 03:33.082
before someone throws him
in one.

03:33.125 --> 03:35.302
Well, break it to him gently.

03:35.345 --> 03:36.694
Wait-- Me?

03:36.738 --> 03:39.784
Swimming's a sport,
and you're a sports person.

03:39.828 --> 03:42.613
And he's a mama's boy,
and you're his mama.

03:44.267 --> 03:45.964
How about we do it together?

03:47.270 --> 03:49.620
Fine, but you can't
hang me out to dry.

03:49.664 --> 03:51.535
Of course not.

03:51.579 --> 03:53.798
We're a team.
We're in this together, right?

03:53.842 --> 03:55.104
You bet.

03:56.758 --> 03:59.239
She's gonna hang me out to dry.

04:02.329 --> 04:04.374
ADULT SHELDON: Observation
is an important part

04:04.418 --> 04:06.246
of the scientific method.

04:06.289 --> 04:08.596
Darwin observed the finches,

04:08.639 --> 04:11.120
Jane Goodall observed
the chimpanzees,

04:11.163 --> 04:13.253
and for some reason,

04:13.296 --> 04:16.778
Dr. Sturgis wanted to observe
my meemaw's new suitor.

04:16.821 --> 04:18.345
DALE:
Couple days, so...

04:20.956 --> 04:22.827
Excuse me just
for one second.

04:23.828 --> 04:26.657
Howdy. Can I help you?

04:26.701 --> 04:28.920
No, no, just browsing.

04:28.964 --> 04:30.270
Yeah, well,

04:30.313 --> 04:32.097
any particular sport
you might need that for?

04:32.141 --> 04:34.143
Depends. What the heck is it?

04:34.186 --> 04:36.101
It's a cup.

04:36.145 --> 04:38.016
A cup?

04:38.060 --> 04:41.237
What kind of a cup
has holes in it?

04:41.281 --> 04:44.762
Well, it protects
your private parts.

04:44.806 --> 04:46.982
Oh.

04:47.025 --> 04:48.984
Well, I can see how

04:49.027 --> 04:50.333
that might be useful.

04:50.377 --> 04:52.901
Well, this has been
very informative.

04:52.944 --> 04:54.337
Thank you.

04:54.381 --> 04:56.600
You're welcome.

04:56.644 --> 04:58.428
You just, uh...

04:58.472 --> 05:00.865
If you have any more
questions, you let me know.

05:00.909 --> 05:02.563
I certainly will.

05:04.347 --> 05:06.306
All right.

05:08.960 --> 05:12.268
Georgie, I want you to keep an
eye on that weirdo over there.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.530
GEORGE JR.:
I know

05:13.574 --> 05:16.141
that weirdo.
He used to date my meemaw.

05:16.185 --> 05:17.360
That guy?

05:17.404 --> 05:19.449
Yeah, he's, like,
super smart.

05:23.497 --> 05:25.542
I'm not sure
I believe you.

05:27.196 --> 05:28.632
Hey, Dr. Sturgis.

05:28.676 --> 05:29.894
Hello!

05:29.938 --> 05:32.070
Wait. Uh-oh.

05:32.114 --> 05:33.681
Hello.

05:33.724 --> 05:36.423
I may have made
a questionable, uh, decision

05:36.466 --> 05:38.250
regarding our friendship.

05:39.295 --> 05:41.210
What have you done, John?

05:41.253 --> 05:43.125
I went
to the sporting goods store

05:43.168 --> 05:45.345
to check out your new fella.

05:45.388 --> 05:47.129
Did you speak to him?

05:47.172 --> 05:50.437
Oh, yes. In fact,
he sold me an athletic supporter

05:50.480 --> 05:52.439
to protect my genitals.

05:52.482 --> 05:54.354
Good.

05:54.397 --> 05:57.835
You may want to be wearing that
next time I see you.

05:57.879 --> 06:00.142
Okay.

06:01.839 --> 06:03.145
Shelly,

06:03.188 --> 06:05.408
can you turn the
TV off for a second?

06:05.452 --> 06:06.844
But after this commercial break,

06:06.888 --> 06:08.977
Professor Proton is going
to use a candle

06:09.020 --> 06:11.153
to suck a hard-boiled egg
into a milk bottle.

06:11.196 --> 06:13.416
We'll make it quick.

06:13.460 --> 06:16.201
Go ahead.

06:16.245 --> 06:18.290
Your father has something
to tell you.

06:20.031 --> 06:22.469
Your mother wants
you to swim.George!

06:22.512 --> 06:23.774
Mom!

06:23.818 --> 06:25.559
PROFESSOR PROTON:
Who's ready to suck eggs?

06:37.222 --> 06:39.921
That was the lamest
tantrum I've ever seen.

06:39.964 --> 06:43.141
I'm being forced
to swim tomorrow in P.E.

06:43.185 --> 06:45.317
Poor baby. You have
to play in a pool

06:45.361 --> 06:47.102
instead of sit
in a classroom.

06:47.145 --> 06:49.844
A pool of sweat, germs
and dead skin cells.

06:49.887 --> 06:52.063
Still better
than learning.

06:52.107 --> 06:54.239
Maybe it's time for me
to run away from home

06:54.283 --> 06:56.285
and join a traveling math club.

06:56.328 --> 06:57.591
Just pretend to be sick.

06:57.634 --> 07:00.158
But that would be lying.
I'm not a liar.

07:00.202 --> 07:02.160
Well, you better be a swimmer.

07:02.204 --> 07:04.162
Or a drowner.

07:14.346 --> 07:15.739
Ugh!

07:15.783 --> 07:18.089
FEMALE VOICE:
Why don't you like me?

07:18.133 --> 07:20.396
You're full of bacteria.

07:20.440 --> 07:24.182
So are you, but you don't hear
me saying, "Ugh." It's rude.

07:24.226 --> 07:26.794
Look, I may just be pool water,

07:26.837 --> 07:29.274
but I still have feelings.

07:29.318 --> 07:30.972
Sorry, water.

07:31.015 --> 07:32.321
Come on.

07:32.364 --> 07:34.715
My pH level is 7.4,

07:34.758 --> 07:36.847
and with three parts
per million of chlorine,

07:36.891 --> 07:38.893
I'm cleaner
than your daddy's plate

07:38.936 --> 07:40.242
after Thanksgiving dinner.

07:40.285 --> 07:42.592
Wow. That's pretty clean.

07:42.636 --> 07:46.204
Look how clear I am, Sheldon.

07:46.248 --> 07:49.599
You can see
all the way to the bottom.

07:50.948 --> 07:53.255
Closer.

07:56.301 --> 07:59.000
A little closer.

08:00.828 --> 08:02.525
A little closer.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.964
Gotcha!

08:07.008 --> 08:09.314
Pool monster!

08:11.403 --> 08:13.318
I don't feel well.

08:13.362 --> 08:14.581
What's wrong, baby?

08:14.624 --> 08:17.279
I don't know.
I just feel awful.

08:17.322 --> 08:19.716
Well, there is something
going around.

08:19.760 --> 08:22.110
Billy Sparks got
some kind of bug.

08:22.153 --> 08:26.462
That is consistent
with what I said. Good.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.464
You're staying home today.

08:28.508 --> 08:31.467
I'll go make you some tea.

08:33.338 --> 08:35.471
Welcome to the dark side.

08:43.435 --> 08:45.394
Mom says
you're sick.

08:45.437 --> 08:46.656
He's faking.

08:46.700 --> 08:49.485
Really?

08:50.617 --> 08:52.923
Why? You love school.

08:52.967 --> 08:54.142
Swim test.

08:54.185 --> 08:55.578
Oh, sure. You would die.

08:55.622 --> 08:57.014
If you're gonna do this,

08:57.058 --> 08:58.494
let me give you
some pointers.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.365
You've done this before?

09:00.409 --> 09:01.932
Tell him.

09:01.976 --> 09:03.586
Oh, he's
the master.

09:03.630 --> 09:05.588
He coached me through
my last two...

09:05.632 --> 09:08.025
sore throats.

09:08.069 --> 09:10.506
I slept on the couch
during those.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.899
I know.

09:11.942 --> 09:13.204
GEORGE JR.:
First of all,

09:13.248 --> 09:15.337
you got to cough
even when Mom's not in the room.

09:15.380 --> 09:16.599
Got it.

09:18.949 --> 09:20.864
And don't put the thermometer
in the tea.

09:20.908 --> 09:23.345
114 fever is a giveaway.

09:23.388 --> 09:25.782
Smart.Told you.

09:25.826 --> 09:27.871
Oh, don't be afraid
to let her look in your throat.

09:27.915 --> 09:29.264
She's checking
to see if it's red,

09:29.307 --> 09:30.874
but it's always red.

09:30.918 --> 09:32.354
You aregood.

09:32.397 --> 09:34.835
Here, try spitting up
a little phlegm.

09:42.973 --> 09:44.018
We got work to do.

09:44.061 --> 09:46.368
I'm sure he'll
feel better tomorrow.

09:46.411 --> 09:48.892
And you can send any homework
that he needs to do

09:48.936 --> 09:49.937
with his brother.

09:49.980 --> 09:51.199
Thank you.

09:53.854 --> 09:55.682
Doesn't this all seem
a little convenient?

09:55.725 --> 09:57.509
You think he's faking it?

09:57.553 --> 09:59.076
Today's the swim test.

09:59.120 --> 10:02.036
It's pretty suspicious.

10:02.079 --> 10:04.778
Sheldon just coughed up
something gross in a tissue.

10:04.821 --> 10:05.953
See?

10:05.996 --> 10:07.824
And that's why
he's staying home.

10:07.868 --> 10:10.653
Mary, come on.

10:10.697 --> 10:12.655
No, I am not changing my mind.
My little boy

10:12.699 --> 10:14.222
is not a liar.

10:18.574 --> 10:20.228
Connie Tucker?

10:20.271 --> 10:21.882
Yeah.Here you go.

10:21.925 --> 10:24.449
Well, thank you.You're welcome.

10:24.493 --> 10:25.886
Hmm.

10:30.455 --> 10:32.414
"I overstepped

10:32.457 --> 10:33.850
"the bounds of friendship.

10:33.894 --> 10:35.547
"Sorry.

10:35.591 --> 10:37.854
John."

10:37.898 --> 10:39.464
Hello?

10:39.508 --> 10:41.205
So, why in the hell
would your ex-boyfriend

10:41.249 --> 10:43.251
send me a giant cookie?

10:48.517 --> 10:50.650
MARY:
My little boy is not a liar.

10:50.693 --> 10:52.564
My little boy is not a liar.

10:55.045 --> 10:56.873
You don't have a temperature.

10:56.917 --> 10:59.659
That's good. You want to
get comfy on the couch

10:59.702 --> 11:01.443
and watch your Star Trektapes?

11:02.487 --> 11:03.880
No, thank you.

11:04.925 --> 11:07.841
I know what'll make you
feel better.

11:08.972 --> 11:11.975
♪ Soft kitty, warm kitty

11:12.019 --> 11:14.195
♪ Little ball of fur

11:14.238 --> 11:16.545
♪ Happy kitty

11:16.588 --> 11:18.068
♪ Sleepy kitty

11:18.112 --> 11:20.897
♪ Purr, purr, purr

11:20.941 --> 11:23.770
♪ Soft liar, warm liar

11:23.813 --> 11:27.295
♪ Little ball of fib

11:27.338 --> 11:29.906
♪ Happy liar, sleepy liar

11:29.950 --> 11:32.909
♪ Fib, fib, fib.

11:35.346 --> 11:36.304
Feel better?

11:36.347 --> 11:38.349
Uh-uh.

11:41.396 --> 11:43.050
Really?

11:43.093 --> 11:44.747
Cooper's out sick?

11:44.791 --> 11:46.009
What a baby.

11:46.053 --> 11:48.969
Really? Cooper's out sick?

11:49.012 --> 11:50.535
Oh, baby!

11:50.579 --> 11:52.015
Hallelujah!

11:52.059 --> 11:54.931
Happy birthday to me.

11:54.975 --> 11:57.804
MARY:
Shelly, I'm gonna run

11:57.847 --> 12:00.763
to the grocery store real quick
so I can make you some soup.

12:00.807 --> 12:01.764
Okay.

12:03.548 --> 12:05.899
ADULT SHELDON:
I had lied to my mother
and gotten away with it.

12:05.942 --> 12:08.553
The guilt was more
than I could take.

12:10.164 --> 12:12.819
I had to make this right.

12:12.862 --> 12:15.909
I could confess
and break my mother's heart,

12:15.952 --> 12:19.042
or I could turn my lie
into the truth

12:19.086 --> 12:20.740
and actually get myself sick.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.699
Hi, Sheldon.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.049
Hello, Billy. I hear
you're not feeling well.

12:26.093 --> 12:28.138
I'm not. I have a cold.

12:28.182 --> 12:29.661
That's too bad.

12:29.705 --> 12:31.098
Put her there.

12:33.187 --> 12:34.362
Why?

12:34.405 --> 12:36.146
Just shake my hand, Billy.

12:36.190 --> 12:38.453
But my mom says
that's how germs get spread.

12:38.496 --> 12:39.541
I know.You do?

12:39.584 --> 12:41.282
When did you talk to my mom?

12:41.325 --> 12:42.283
Just, eh...

12:45.112 --> 12:47.157
Ugh!

12:47.201 --> 12:48.593
Wait, want to play?

12:49.638 --> 12:51.640
Aw.

12:58.560 --> 13:01.519
Ooh, is that for
your patient?

13:01.563 --> 13:02.825
Yes.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.305
He's still under the weather.

13:04.348 --> 13:06.307
Oh, that's too bad.

13:06.350 --> 13:08.309
Running a fever?

13:08.352 --> 13:10.006
No.

13:10.050 --> 13:11.312
Sniffly nose?

13:11.355 --> 13:12.922
No.

13:12.966 --> 13:14.532
But he couldn't even

13:14.576 --> 13:16.752
bring himself to watch
his Star Trekshow.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.928
Oh, dear.
I better go call an ambulance.

13:18.972 --> 13:20.321
You're not funny.

13:20.364 --> 13:21.931
And he ain't sick.

13:24.978 --> 13:27.284
Cheers.Cheers.

13:27.328 --> 13:29.330
Mm.

13:29.373 --> 13:31.854
Now, don't fill up on those.

13:31.898 --> 13:34.204
We still got two
giant cookies to finish.

13:34.248 --> 13:36.511
I'm sorry about all
that stuff with John.

13:36.554 --> 13:38.861
I... He means well,
but sometimes

13:38.905 --> 13:42.038
he can just be, uh...
a little quirky.

13:42.082 --> 13:43.823
Yeah, I kind of figured that;
yeah, I watched him

13:43.866 --> 13:45.955
play ping-pong
with his own crotch.

13:45.999 --> 13:49.524
I don't know what that is,
but I'm sure he did it.

13:49.567 --> 13:51.308
Well, I mean,
how'd you meet this guy?

13:51.352 --> 13:53.397
What, did you try
to steal his pot of gold

13:53.441 --> 13:54.877
at the end of the rainbow?

13:54.921 --> 13:58.576
Okay, okay, he's
a very sweet man.

13:58.620 --> 14:01.275
Well, I bet he is.

14:01.318 --> 14:03.146
If you must know,

14:03.190 --> 14:05.888
he's Sheldon's
college professor.

14:05.932 --> 14:08.195
Smart, short and weird--

14:08.238 --> 14:09.544
well, that's the whole package

14:09.587 --> 14:11.241
right there.
Hey, okay,

14:11.285 --> 14:12.416
that's enough.

14:13.940 --> 14:16.029
Well, I got to ask.

14:16.072 --> 14:18.379
Do you feel like you're dating

14:18.422 --> 14:21.382
a supermodel right now?

14:26.213 --> 14:28.258
You didn't touch
your soup, baby.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.305
I'm not hungry.

14:31.348 --> 14:32.654
You aren't feelin' any better?

14:35.483 --> 14:37.267
Well, it'll be in the fridge

14:37.311 --> 14:39.313
if you change your mind.

14:45.797 --> 14:47.277
BATMAN:
Young man.

14:47.321 --> 14:48.888
Yes, you.

14:50.063 --> 14:51.673
Pretending to be sick.

14:51.716 --> 14:53.936
You should be
ashamed of yourself!

14:53.980 --> 14:56.069
But I was afraid
to go in the pool.

14:56.112 --> 14:57.157
You are in a pool.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.898
A pool of your own deceit.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.378
If my mother were alive,

15:01.422 --> 15:04.338
I'd never lie to her.

15:04.381 --> 15:07.776
And I'd always eat her soup.

15:07.819 --> 15:09.952
My grandson's
trying to steal home,

15:09.996 --> 15:12.259
and he trips and he falls
and lands face-first

15:12.302 --> 15:15.175
on the plate, lost a tooth,
we won the game.

15:15.218 --> 15:16.480
Get this.

15:17.742 --> 15:20.267
He finds the tooth
two days later...

15:20.310 --> 15:23.270
when he goes to the bathroom.

15:28.449 --> 15:30.233
That's it?

15:30.277 --> 15:31.408
You don't understand.

15:31.452 --> 15:32.453
He found the tooth...

15:32.496 --> 15:33.933
I got it.

15:33.976 --> 15:35.369
What's going on? You okay?

15:35.412 --> 15:36.979
Actually, no.

15:37.023 --> 15:39.764
I don't like the way you've
been talkin' about John.

15:39.808 --> 15:42.332
I was kidding around.

15:42.376 --> 15:43.551
Well, it bothered me.

15:43.594 --> 15:45.379
Wait a minute, hold it,
hold, hold, hold.

15:45.422 --> 15:48.991
Your weirdo ex comes sneaking
around, checking me out,

15:49.035 --> 15:51.037
and all of a sudden,
I'm the bad guy here?

15:51.080 --> 15:52.603
You don't get
to call him a weirdo.

15:52.647 --> 15:54.431
You don't think he's a weirdo?

15:54.475 --> 15:55.432
Of course he's a weirdo.

15:55.476 --> 15:56.999
You just can't say it.

15:57.043 --> 16:00.133
Oh, I didn't think
it was that big a deal.

16:00.176 --> 16:02.004
Well, it is.
He and I

16:02.048 --> 16:04.180
are friends, and if you don't
stop makin' fun of him,

16:04.224 --> 16:06.052
you and I are gonna
have a problem.

16:06.095 --> 16:09.359
Are you saying
that I'm being naughty,

16:09.403 --> 16:12.928
and you're threatening
to punish me?

16:12.972 --> 16:15.887
'Cause I might like that.

16:15.931 --> 16:18.499
Uh-huh.

16:18.542 --> 16:20.718
See, you're tryin' to be mad
at me and you can't.

16:22.416 --> 16:24.679
Now you aregetting punished.

16:24.722 --> 16:25.854
Check, please!

16:27.987 --> 16:29.510
Mom.

16:29.553 --> 16:31.294
Oh, baby.

16:31.338 --> 16:32.992
What are you doing
out of bed?

16:33.035 --> 16:35.559
I don't need to be in bed.

16:35.603 --> 16:37.300
I'm not sick.

16:37.344 --> 16:38.475
What?

16:38.519 --> 16:40.347
I lied to you

16:40.390 --> 16:42.784
so that I wouldn't have
to take the swim test.

16:42.827 --> 16:43.959
You lied?

16:44.003 --> 16:46.048
I feel terrible about it.

16:46.092 --> 16:48.703
Well, you should
feel terrible.

16:48.746 --> 16:50.487
I trusted you.

16:50.531 --> 16:52.098
I'm sorry. It's just
that I was so afraid

16:52.141 --> 16:53.664
to get in that pool,
so I let Georgie

16:53.708 --> 16:55.144
and Missy teach me
how to fake it.

16:55.188 --> 16:56.319
They said it was easy,
but it's wasn't.

16:56.363 --> 16:58.365
It really wasn't.

16:58.408 --> 17:00.193
Georgie and Missy taught you
how to do this?

17:00.236 --> 17:02.499
I cannot tell a lie--
they sure did!

17:02.543 --> 17:06.155
Okay, calm down.

17:06.199 --> 17:09.028
Now, you listen to me,
you shouldn't have lied.

17:09.071 --> 17:11.769
It's always wrong.

17:11.813 --> 17:15.295
But you made up for it
by telling me the truth.

17:15.338 --> 17:16.644
So, you forgive me?

17:16.687 --> 17:18.385
I do, but...

17:18.428 --> 17:19.995
I need you to do me a favor.

17:20.039 --> 17:23.477
As far as your father is
concerned, you were sick.

17:23.520 --> 17:24.565
Isn't that lying?

17:24.608 --> 17:26.393
Honestly?

17:26.436 --> 17:27.611
No.

17:33.269 --> 17:34.357
ADULT SHELDON: The following
day, I returned to school.

17:34.401 --> 17:36.359
I had no choice but to fulfill

17:36.403 --> 17:38.057
my swimming requirement.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.362
Much like Batman,

17:39.406 --> 17:43.149
I suited up and faced my fears.

17:43.192 --> 17:45.151
Unlike Batman,
I did it with a doggy-paddle

17:45.194 --> 17:47.370
across the shallow end
of the pool.

17:47.414 --> 17:49.198
Uh, regarding pool sanitation,

17:49.242 --> 17:50.721
it turned out I was right.

17:50.765 --> 17:51.983
Itwas teeming with germs.

17:52.027 --> 17:54.116
Only I was the one

17:54.160 --> 17:55.465
who put them there.

17:55.509 --> 17:56.597
As it happens,

17:56.640 --> 17:58.120
my interaction
with Billy Sparks

17:58.164 --> 17:59.469
did get me sick.

17:59.513 --> 18:02.646
I, in turn,
created a small epidemic

18:02.690 --> 18:06.563
taking down 128 students,

18:06.607 --> 18:08.130
four teachers...

18:08.174 --> 18:09.610
and one principal.

18:09.653 --> 18:10.915
It didn't stop there.

18:10.959 --> 18:13.527
I also infected my mother,

18:13.570 --> 18:14.702
father,

18:14.745 --> 18:15.877
sister, brother,

18:15.920 --> 18:16.834
Meemaw...

18:16.878 --> 18:19.272
and Meemaw's friend Dale.

18:19.315 --> 18:21.361
The newly established
boundaries of friendship

18:21.404 --> 18:23.406
helped keep
Dr. Sturgis healthy.

18:23.450 --> 18:25.408
However,
in an unrelated incident,

18:25.452 --> 18:28.237
he crashed his bike
into some garbage cans.

18:28.281 --> 18:32.546
Luckily, he landed on his recently acquired athletic cup.

18:32.589 --> 18:34.591
STURGIS:
That was a wise purchase.
