00:04.626 --> 00:06.000
- Hey, that guy's
- pretty good.

00:06.042 --> 00:08.000
(APPLAUDING)

00:08.042 --> 00:09.313
And judging

00:09.314 --> 00:10.584
from the crowd,

00:08.042 --> 00:10.584
he must be

00:10.626 --> 00:11.959
really hot...

00:11.960 --> 00:13.292
Diggety-dog!

00:13.334 --> 00:14.355
What happened

00:14.356 --> 00:15.375
to Stuart?

00:15.417 --> 00:17.042
- Good-night,
- Central Park!

00:17.083 --> 00:19.000
- Remember to tip
- your nannies!

00:19.876 --> 00:20.898
Wow!

00:20.899 --> 00:21.918
Ditto!

00:24.792 --> 00:26.418
Stuart, you sound great.

00:26.419 --> 00:28.042
And you look...

00:28.083 --> 00:30.042
- And I mean this - in the nicest
- Possible way,

00:30.083 --> 00:32.042
So not like you.

00:32.083 --> 00:34.042
Meet Stuart 2.0,

00:34.043 --> 00:36.000
the newer,

00:32.083 --> 00:36.000
cooler model.

00:38.042 --> 00:39.918
- I can't believe
- I'm saying this,

00:39.959 --> 00:41.542
- But I might want to
- kick the tires

00:41.584 --> 00:42.960
And take that cooler model

00:42.961 --> 00:44.334
for a test drive.

00:44.375 --> 00:45.918
Know what I mean?

00:47.542 --> 00:48.667
I hope not.

00:51.417 --> 00:53.230
Honestly, I can't take

00:53.231 --> 00:55.042
all the credit

00:51.417 --> 00:55.042
for my transformation.

00:55.083 --> 00:57.042
- So, who does
- get the credit?

00:57.083 --> 00:58.772
And can I get an appointment

00:58.773 --> 01:00.459
with them before my

00:57.083 --> 01:00.459
high school reunion?

01:00.500 --> 01:01.792
I owe it all to my

01:01.793 --> 01:03.083
new nanny, Hudson.

01:03.125 --> 01:05.042
- Well, where is this
- miracle worker?

01:05.083 --> 01:06.251
He's around.

01:06.252 --> 01:07.417
He said if I need him,

01:07.459 --> 01:09.000
- to just blow
- on this conch shell.

01:11.083 --> 01:12.083
(BLOWING)

01:17.042 --> 01:19.000
- What's going on,
- Stu-dog?

01:19.042 --> 01:20.000
- I'm in the middle
- of a crazy

01:19.042 --> 01:20.042
Ultimate Disc game.

01:21.083 --> 01:22.959
Whoo. Ow, ow, ow!

01:24.584 --> 01:26.209
What is he? A nanny,

01:26.210 --> 01:27.834
or a German shepherd?

01:27.876 --> 01:30.042
Hey, bro and bro-citas.

01:30.083 --> 01:31.438
I'm Hudson,

01:31.439 --> 01:32.792
and I'm not a nanny.

01:32.834 --> 01:34.209
- I'm a manny.

01:34.250 --> 01:35.647
Well, whatever you are,

01:35.648 --> 01:37.042
you're not very good at it.

01:37.083 --> 01:38.230
You left your charge

01:38.231 --> 01:39.375
unsupervised in the park.

01:39.417 --> 01:40.939
No, I left him

01:40.940 --> 01:42.459
unsupervised in the deli.

01:42.500 --> 01:43.901
- He made his own way
- to the park.

01:45.125 --> 01:46.626
- Hey, Stu-dog,
- why don't you

01:46.667 --> 01:47.855
And your little friend

01:47.856 --> 01:49.042
go dive for pennies

01:46.667 --> 01:49.042
in that duck pond?

- Whoever holds their - breath the longest,
- Gets a dollar!

- how dangerous that is?

01:56.481 --> 01:58.000
Yeah, that's why they're

01:58.959 --> 02:01.125

This weekend is

03:03.835 --> 03:05.584
the Walden Academy

03:02.083 --> 03:05.584
talent show.

03:05.626 --> 03:06.730
Are either of you

03:06.731 --> 03:07.834
going to participate?

03:07.876 --> 03:09.000
Ha! No.

03:11.042 --> 03:12.438
Dude, only dorks

03:12.439 --> 03:13.834
do that stuff.

03:15.083 --> 03:16.438
You're doing it,

03:16.439 --> 03:17.792
aren't you?

03:17.834 --> 03:19.185
- I was the first one
- to sign up!

03:19.209 --> 03:21.042
(SIGHS)

03:21.083 --> 03:22.126
I plan on wowing

03:22.127 --> 03:23.167
the crowd with my

03:21.083 --> 03:23.167
cup stacking routine.

03:23.209 --> 03:25.042
- What the heck
- is cup stacking?

03:25.083 --> 03:27.063
It is the delicate art of

03:27.064 --> 03:29.042
briskly stacking cups,

03:25.083 --> 03:29.042
then unstacking them,

03:29.083 --> 03:31.000
then stacking them again.

03:31.042 --> 03:32.584
So your talent is chores?

03:34.876 --> 03:36.730
No! Have you not seen

03:36.731 --> 03:38.584
kids doing it

03:34.876 --> 03:38.584
on the internet?

03:38.626 --> 03:39.834
It is very cool!

03:39.876 --> 03:41.355
Just because

03:41.356 --> 03:42.834
it's on the internet

03:39.876 --> 03:42.834
doesn't mean it's cool.

03:42.876 --> 03:44.460
Have you watched

03:44.461 --> 03:46.042
Bertram's boy band audition?

03:46.083 --> 03:47.226
- Actually, would you
- watch it?

03:47.250 --> 03:49.209
Somehow,

03:49.210 --> 03:51.167
I'm at negative

03:47.250 --> 03:51.167
seven views.

03:51.209 --> 03:53.126
Ravi, I don't want to

03:53.127 --> 03:55.042
see you get up on stage

03:51.209 --> 03:55.042
and embarrass yourself.

03:55.083 --> 03:57.042
- Yeah, I see enough
- of that in gym class

03:57.083 --> 03:58.563
When you try to

03:58.564 --> 04:00.042
climb the rope.

04:00.083 --> 04:02.042
- Seriously, - what is the point
- Of that?

04:02.083 --> 04:03.897
Hello, they make

04:03.898 --> 04:05.709
ladders now.

04:05.751 --> 04:07.397
Anyway,

04:07.398 --> 04:09.042
if I do not do cup stacking,

04:05.751 --> 04:09.042
then what could I do?

04:09.083 --> 04:10.959
- Something people
- want to see.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.022
Like a big song

04:12.023 --> 04:13.042
and dance routine!

04:13.083 --> 04:14.042
That is a great idea!

04:14.083 --> 04:15.167
Except I cannot

04:15.168 --> 04:16.250
sing or dance!

04:16.291 --> 04:18.041
- Well, I can teach
- you to dance.

04:18.083 --> 04:19.959
- I can teach
- you to sing.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.125
And I can you

04:21.125 --> 04:22.250
how do it all with

04:20.000 --> 04:22.250
pizzazz and style!

04:22.292 --> 04:24.042
- You all would
- do that for me?

04:24.083 --> 04:26.042
- Beats doing homework.
- Beats doing work work.

04:26.083 --> 04:27.876
- (GIGGLING)
- I get to use glitter!

04:32.125 --> 04:33.147
Zuri, Stuart,

04:33.148 --> 04:34.167
did you wash

04:32.125 --> 04:34.167
your hands?

04:34.209 --> 04:35.688
Aw, come on.

04:35.689 --> 04:37.167
Who ever said a little

04:34.209 --> 04:37.167
dirt was bad for you?

04:37.209 --> 04:40.042
Uh, science.

04:40.083 --> 04:41.667
And I'm sure you've

04:41.668 --> 04:43.250
noticed by now that Stuart's

04:40.083 --> 04:43.250
a bit of a germaphobe.

04:43.292 --> 04:45.626
That was the old me.

04:45.667 --> 04:47.334
Hudson says living with

04:47.335 --> 04:49.000
dirt and pathogens builds

04:45.667 --> 04:49.000
my resistance to disease.

04:49.042 --> 04:50.042
We live with Luke.

04:50.083 --> 04:53.042
We must be immortal!

04:53.083 --> 04:54.563
No offense, but that's

04:54.564 --> 04:56.042
the most ridiculous thing

04:53.083 --> 04:56.042
I've ever heard.

04:56.083 --> 04:58.042
- So, I suppose
- you wash your hands

04:58.083 --> 04:59.564
- After you go to
- the bathroom, too?

05:01.083 --> 05:02.792
Yes. Yes, I do.

05:02.834 --> 05:04.439
And I'm really starting

05:04.440 --> 05:06.042
to regret shaking yours.

05:06.083 --> 05:07.647
Well, I think kids can

05:07.648 --> 05:09.209
pretty much take care

05:06.083 --> 05:09.209
of themselves.

05:09.250 --> 05:11.042
- You're a nanny!
- Your entire livelihood

05:11.083 --> 05:12.167
Is based on the fact

05:12.168 --> 05:13.250
that kids can't take care

05:11.083 --> 05:13.250
of themselves!

05:14.834 --> 05:16.042
Jessie, chill.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.209
Whatever Hudson's doing,

05:17.210 --> 05:18.334
it's working.

05:18.375 --> 05:19.793
He's taken

05:19.794 --> 05:21.209
the 'ew' out of

05:18.375 --> 05:21.209
Stuart.

05:21.250 --> 05:23.000
Zuri, that's not nice.

05:23.042 --> 05:24.542
No, she's right.

05:24.543 --> 05:26.042
I used to be

05:23.042 --> 05:26.042
a real uptight mess...

05:26.083 --> 05:28.959
Kind of like you.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.396
I am not uptight!

05:30.397 --> 05:31.792
Okay, kids just need

05:29.000 --> 05:31.792
boundaries!

05:31.834 --> 05:33.918
Stop worrying so much.

05:33.959 --> 05:35.001
You know what they say,

05:35.002 --> 05:36.042
kids have nine lives.

05:36.083 --> 05:37.147
That's cats!

05:37.148 --> 05:38.209
Cats have nine lives!

05:38.250 --> 05:39.647
Exactly.

05:39.648 --> 05:41.042
That's why cats can be

05:41.083 --> 05:43.042
- anything they want to be
- when they grow up.

05:43.083 --> 05:45.083
No, that's kids!

05:45.125 --> 05:46.584
Cats, kids,

05:46.585 --> 05:48.042
what's the difference?

05:48.083 --> 05:49.355
(CHUCKLES) Wow, I'm glad

05:49.356 --> 05:50.626
you're not a pediatrician!

05:55.125 --> 05:56.480
Now, before you

05:56.481 --> 05:57.834
wow them at the talent show,

05:57.876 --> 05:59.393
- you need to learn
- some of the basics.

05:59.417 --> 06:00.730
Here's a simple

06:00.731 --> 06:02.042
major scale.

06:02.083 --> 06:04.147
Do, re, mi, fa, so,

06:04.148 --> 06:06.209
la, ti, do!

06:06.250 --> 06:07.959
Now you try.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.042
- Do...
- Do...

06:09.083 --> 06:10.042
Little lower. Do...

06:10.083 --> 06:11.959
- Do...
- Little, little lower.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.584
Do... Re... Mi...

06:13.585 --> 06:15.167
Fee... Fie... Foe... Fum...

06:15.209 --> 06:17.000
- (SHRILLY)
- Do!

06:21.334 --> 06:22.334
Nailed it.

06:24.250 --> 06:26.626
We'll work on the minor

06:26.627 --> 06:29.000
scale right after I pick-up

06:24.250 --> 06:29.000
a pint of AB positive.

06:34.417 --> 06:36.209
Wow, bummer that

06:36.210 --> 06:38.000
the planetarium was closed.

06:38.042 --> 06:39.351
- But at least we got out
- for some fresh air.

06:39.375 --> 06:41.059
- This is New York.
- The only thing fresh was

06:41.083 --> 06:42.563
The guy sitting next to me

06:42.564 --> 06:44.042
on the subway.

06:44.083 --> 06:45.459
Hey, he taught the kids

06:45.460 --> 06:46.834
some new words.

06:46.876 --> 06:48.042
- Yeah, and if you
- use them,

06:48.083 --> 06:49.959
- There's a bar of soap
- in your future.

06:51.167 --> 06:52.938
So, I guess rain-check

06:52.939 --> 06:54.709
on the planetarium.

06:54.751 --> 06:55.938
Don't sweat it,

06:55.939 --> 06:57.125
we will reskedge.

06:59.834 --> 07:01.751
- Great! How about
- this weekend?

07:01.792 --> 07:02.918
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:02.919 --> 07:04.042
Slow your roll.

07:04.083 --> 07:06.042
Stu-dog doesn't like

07:06.043 --> 07:08.000
to be tied down on a leash.

07:10.500 --> 07:11.605
It'll happen

07:11.606 --> 07:12.709
when it happens.

07:14.292 --> 07:15.606
I'm available

07:15.607 --> 07:16.918
whenever you are.

07:16.959 --> 07:19.001
I hope it's soon!

07:19.002 --> 07:21.042
I'll be waiting

07:16.959 --> 07:21.042
by the phone!

07:21.083 --> 07:22.209
Dial it back, Zuri.

07:22.250 --> 07:24.000
Too needy, too needy!

07:26.250 --> 07:27.688
Listen, we can still have

07:27.689 --> 07:29.125
a killer night

07:26.250 --> 07:29.125
under the stars.

07:29.167 --> 07:30.814
We'll just go sit

07:30.815 --> 07:32.459
on the ledge and look at

07:29.167 --> 07:32.459
the real night sky!

07:32.500 --> 07:33.813
Wha... Zuri and Stuart

07:33.814 --> 07:35.125
cannot sit on the ledge!

07:35.167 --> 07:36.959
They might fall.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Hudson, feel free.

07:40.334 --> 07:41.959
Huh.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.396
You can't really see

07:43.397 --> 07:44.792
many stars in New York.

07:44.834 --> 07:46.334
- Unless you count
- when Jessie gazes

07:46.375 --> 07:47.813
At Ryan Gosling through

07:47.814 --> 07:49.250
the window at Zabar's.

07:49.292 --> 07:50.876
(BOTH LAUGHING)

07:50.918 --> 07:51.980
Man, can that guy

07:51.981 --> 07:53.042
schmear a bagel.

07:54.876 --> 07:56.460
Well, if it's a show

07:56.461 --> 07:58.042
in the night sky you want,

07:58.083 --> 08:00.083
allow me to oblige.

08:00.125 --> 08:01.476
- Who wants to see
- some fireworks?

08:01.500 --> 08:03.334
- Me!
- Oh, goodie!

08:04.167 --> 08:05.480
I mean,

08:05.481 --> 08:06.792
that could be dope.

08:09.209 --> 08:10.626
You carry illegal

08:10.627 --> 08:12.042
fireworks with you?

08:12.083 --> 08:13.459
Duh.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.226
- It would be irresponsible
- to leave them lying around

08:15.250 --> 08:16.293
Where they could fall into

08:16.294 --> 08:17.334
the wrong hands.

08:17.375 --> 08:19.417
I think they already have.

08:19.459 --> 08:21.083
- Look, would you
- just relax?

08:21.125 --> 08:23.167
I'm a responsible adult.

08:23.209 --> 08:25.000
- Stop being such
- a wet blanket.

08:26.959 --> 08:28.167
- We need a
- wet blanket!

08:28.209 --> 08:31.042
We need a wet blanket!

08:31.083 --> 08:32.542
- And this is why
- we don't play

08:32.583 --> 08:34.458
- "Hit the Fern
- with a Bottle Rocket!"

08:42.125 --> 08:43.333
Well, everyone's

08:43.335 --> 08:44.542
alive, so...

08:44.584 --> 08:46.084
No harm, no foul.

08:46.085 --> 08:47.584
(CHUCKLES)

08:47.626 --> 08:49.751
It's a major foul!

08:49.752 --> 08:51.876
You just back-drafted

08:47.626 --> 08:51.876
our balcony!

08:51.918 --> 08:53.189
Because you made me

08:53.190 --> 08:54.459
nervous with all of

08:51.918 --> 08:54.459
your hovering!

08:54.500 --> 08:56.292
- Because you made
- me nervous

08:56.334 --> 08:57.667
With all of your talk about

08:57.668 --> 08:59.000
how warning labels

08:56.334 --> 08:59.000
are just suggestions!

09:01.083 --> 09:02.272
Look, can't you two

09:02.273 --> 09:03.459
just chillax?

09:03.500 --> 09:05.500
Yeah, on the bright side,

09:05.542 --> 09:07.272
this life and death

09:07.273 --> 09:09.000
situation has brought me

09:05.542 --> 09:09.000
and Stuart closer.

09:11.083 --> 09:13.042
- Much like our grill
- and lounge chair,

09:13.083 --> 09:14.918
- Which are now
- fused together.

09:16.083 --> 09:18.042
- We're the ones
- who should be mad.

09:18.083 --> 09:19.563
You put out the fire

09:19.564 --> 09:21.042
before we could

09:18.083 --> 09:21.042
make s'mores!

09:21.083 --> 09:23.000
- Thanks a lot,
- quick-draw.

09:24.667 --> 09:25.834
Hudson, I think

09:25.835 --> 09:27.000
you should leave.

09:27.042 --> 09:28.059
- You're obviously
- a bad influence,

09:28.083 --> 09:29.626
- And I can't have you
- around Zuri.

09:29.667 --> 09:31.000
- Oh, yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

09:31.042 --> 09:32.271
Well, I can't have you

09:32.272 --> 09:33.500
around Stuart.

09:33.542 --> 09:35.293
I don't want him

09:35.294 --> 09:37.042
hanging out with somebody

09:33.542 --> 09:37.042
who's such a buzzkill!

09:37.083 --> 09:39.042
Now you separate us?

09:39.083 --> 09:40.334
Where were you when

09:40.335 --> 09:41.584
he was being all creepy

09:41.626 --> 09:42.834
and shaved my name

09:42.835 --> 09:44.042
in his hair?

09:44.083 --> 09:45.500
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

09:45.542 --> 09:47.293
This is hecka lame, brah!

09:47.294 --> 09:49.042
Stu-dog's about to

09:45.542 --> 09:49.042
go off!

09:49.083 --> 09:51.000
- Can it, Stu-dog!
- Can it, Stu-dog!

09:55.083 --> 09:56.584
Whoa.

09:56.626 --> 09:57.959
Please tell me Mrs. Kipling

09:57.960 --> 09:59.292
didn't lay that,

09:59.334 --> 10:00.751
or we're gonna have

10:00.752 --> 10:02.167
a Godzilla situation

09:59.334 --> 10:02.167
on our hands.

10:04.083 --> 10:05.605
This is going to be Ravi's

10:05.606 --> 10:07.125
big entrance for

10:04.083 --> 10:07.125
the talent show.

10:07.167 --> 10:09.105
The egg represents

10:09.106 --> 10:11.042
an opportunity to

10:07.167 --> 10:11.042
burst out of his shell.

10:11.083 --> 10:12.772
RAVI: Ow-wee!

10:12.773 --> 10:14.459
I hurt my hand on this

10:11.083 --> 10:14.459
rigid material

10:14.500 --> 10:16.459
- you used to
- make the egg.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.042
It's tissue paper!

10:19.167 --> 10:21.000
- RAVI: Yes!
- But it is two-ply.

10:31.375 --> 10:33.709
You think dressing Ravi

10:33.710 --> 10:36.042
like a chicken is going to

10:31.375 --> 10:36.042
help him be popular?

10:36.083 --> 10:37.626
He's an eagle!

10:37.627 --> 10:39.167
Ready to spread

10:36.083 --> 10:39.167
his wings and fly!

10:42.167 --> 10:44.105
He better fly, because

10:44.106 --> 10:46.042
people will be lined up in

10:42.167 --> 10:46.042
the hallway to pluck him.

10:48.709 --> 10:50.042
Okay, Ravi,

10:50.083 --> 10:52.364
- did you practice - this opening
dance move - Last night?

10:58.083 --> 10:59.126
Does this answer

10:59.127 --> 11:00.167
your question?

11:02.083 --> 11:03.083
(GRUNTING)

11:10.209 --> 11:11.417
So, no?

11:13.083 --> 11:14.542
I practiced that

11:14.543 --> 11:16.000
for six hours!

11:17.083 --> 11:19.042
- I did not do
- any of my homework...

11:19.083 --> 11:20.542
For next week.

11:20.543 --> 11:22.000
Naturally, this week is

11:19.083 --> 11:22.000
already done.

11:24.334 --> 11:25.897
Wait a minute?

11:25.898 --> 11:27.459
We had school this week?

11:32.459 --> 11:34.626
Zuri, where are you?

11:34.667 --> 11:36.375
Quit pouting about Stuart

11:36.376 --> 11:38.083
and I'll take you to see

11:34.667 --> 11:38.083
any movie you want!

11:38.125 --> 11:39.250
Within reason!

11:39.292 --> 11:41.751
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

11:41.792 --> 11:43.126
I can't find Stuart!

11:43.127 --> 11:44.459
I think he ran away!

11:44.500 --> 11:46.209
- Wha...
- Zuri's missing too!

11:46.250 --> 11:48.042
They're probably together.

11:48.083 --> 11:50.042
- Oh, no!
- We lost the kids!

11:50.083 --> 11:51.542
What are we gonna do?

11:51.584 --> 11:53.250
- Don't worry,
- I know how to find Zuri.

11:53.292 --> 11:54.542
Because your

11:54.543 --> 11:55.792
nanny-child bond

11:53.292 --> 11:55.792
is so strong

11:55.834 --> 11:57.105
that you've developed a

11:57.106 --> 11:58.375
sixth sense for knowing

11:55.834 --> 11:58.375
exactly where she is?

11:58.417 --> 11:59.542
No, no, I put a

11:59.543 --> 12:00.667
tracking device on her.

12:02.125 --> 12:04.083
Follow me.

12:04.125 --> 12:05.834
- (SNORING)
- (DEVICE BEEPING)

12:05.876 --> 12:07.997
- I don't get it! - The app says
- Zuri's in the room.

12:11.083 --> 12:12.667
(RAPID BEEPING)

12:12.668 --> 12:14.250
Oh, no!

12:14.292 --> 12:16.000
- Bertram fell asleep
- on Zuri!

12:17.542 --> 12:19.042
Help me!

12:19.083 --> 12:20.083
(GRUNTING)

12:22.083 --> 12:23.417
What're you looking for?

12:23.459 --> 12:25.000
A Zuri pancake!

12:26.876 --> 12:28.542
Oh, thank goodness!

12:28.584 --> 12:30.334
Zuri's not crushed!

12:30.375 --> 12:31.501
Although, I think

12:31.502 --> 12:32.626
I can hear

12:30.375 --> 12:32.626
this pillow crying.

12:35.083 --> 12:36.459
Here's Zuri's watch!

12:36.500 --> 12:38.268
- I could have told you - what time it was
- Without you

12:38.292 --> 12:39.876
Throwing me off the couch!

12:39.918 --> 12:41.272
(SCOFFS) I'm just amazed

12:41.273 --> 12:42.626
it still works.

12:42.667 --> 12:45.042
(BOTH LAUGHING)

12:45.083 --> 12:46.272
Oh, great,

12:46.273 --> 12:47.459
another person

12:45.083 --> 12:47.459
in my life to hate.

12:49.918 --> 12:51.375
- I don't want to
- lose my job!

12:51.417 --> 12:53.209
I can't go back to

12:53.210 --> 12:55.000
teaching yoga!

12:51.417 --> 12:55.000
It's too high-pressure!

12:55.918 --> 12:57.292
Then help me find them!

12:57.334 --> 12:59.230
Stuart. Little dude,

12:59.231 --> 13:01.125
let me hear you!

13:01.167 --> 13:03.000
- Blow that conch shell,
- Stu-dog!

13:04.959 --> 13:06.209
(DISTANT HONKING)

13:06.250 --> 13:07.709
Uh...

13:07.751 --> 13:09.126
I can't hear the signal

13:09.127 --> 13:10.500
over all those

13:07.751 --> 13:10.500
road-raging cabbies!

13:10.542 --> 13:12.250
- And that is one
- of the many,

13:12.292 --> 13:13.792
Many reasons we do not

13:13.793 --> 13:15.292
communicate via seashell!

13:21.834 --> 13:23.310
- There's no sign of
- Stuart anywhere!

13:23.334 --> 13:24.334
Zuri, either!

13:24.335 --> 13:25.334
And I went to all her

13:23.334 --> 13:25.334
favorite places.

13:25.375 --> 13:27.250
- The zoo,
- the free sample bakery,

13:27.292 --> 13:29.042
- The Rooty-Tooty
- Cowboy Bootery...

13:29.083 --> 13:30.563
Miranda Lambert's doing

13:30.564 --> 13:32.042
a chaps signing there today.

13:32.083 --> 13:33.334
Well, I struck out

13:33.335 --> 13:34.584
at the Flaxseed Emporium.

13:34.626 --> 13:35.834
Stuart's really

13:35.835 --> 13:37.042
into fiber.

13:34.626 --> 13:37.042
Hmm.

13:37.083 --> 13:38.584
How did this happen?

13:38.626 --> 13:39.876
Oh, probably because

13:39.877 --> 13:41.125
both of his parents are

13:38.626 --> 13:41.125
bowel surgeons.

13:41.167 --> 13:42.792
No, I mean how did

13:42.793 --> 13:44.417
everything get

13:41.167 --> 13:44.417
so messed up?

13:44.459 --> 13:45.584
I came to New York

13:45.585 --> 13:46.709
to become a

13:44.459 --> 13:46.709
famous novelist,

13:46.751 --> 13:47.917
fell out of a cab,

13:47.918 --> 13:49.083
then lucked into a gig

13:46.751 --> 13:49.083
as Stuart's nanny.

13:49.125 --> 13:50.501
And now

13:50.502 --> 13:51.876
I'm blowing it all!

13:51.918 --> 13:53.727
- Ah, you wouldn't understand
- what that's like.

13:53.751 --> 13:55.522
Are you kidding?

13:55.523 --> 13:57.292
You're basically me

13:53.751 --> 13:57.292
with man-hands.

13:57.334 --> 13:59.251
These hands aren't fit

13:59.252 --> 14:01.167
to husk Stuart's flaxseeds!

14:01.209 --> 14:02.501
I just can't believe

14:02.502 --> 14:03.792
they ran off

14:01.209 --> 14:03.792
without saying anything.

14:03.834 --> 14:05.459
Yeah. Stuart really

14:05.460 --> 14:07.083
should have put that

14:03.834 --> 14:07.083
in the note he left.

14:07.125 --> 14:08.959
He left a note?

14:09.000 --> 14:10.647
I know, right?

14:10.648 --> 14:12.292
What kid doesn't text

14:09.000 --> 14:12.292
these days?

14:14.834 --> 14:16.251
It says they're going to

14:16.252 --> 14:17.667
hang out under the stars.

14:17.709 --> 14:18.768
- I just thought that meant
- they were going to

14:18.792 --> 14:20.417
- Hide from us
- until it got dark.

14:20.459 --> 14:21.771
Or they went somewhere

14:21.772 --> 14:23.083
where they can see

14:20.459 --> 14:23.083
the stars right now.

14:24.083 --> 14:26.125
I see what you're saying.

14:26.167 --> 14:27.834
- Zuri and Stuart
- went to...

14:27.876 --> 14:29.334
- The planetarium!
- Hollywood!

14:29.375 --> 14:30.605
Right.

14:30.606 --> 14:31.834
The planetarium.

14:31.876 --> 14:33.459
That makes more sense.

14:39.542 --> 14:40.709
Stuart,

14:40.751 --> 14:42.626
this is so romantic.

14:46.125 --> 14:48.042
- Um, aren't you
- going to tell me

14:48.083 --> 14:50.083
My eyes twinkle brighter

14:50.084 --> 14:52.083
than all the stars

14:48.083 --> 14:52.083
in the galaxy?

14:52.125 --> 14:53.209
Nah, Stu-dog

14:53.210 --> 14:54.292
doesn't do all that.

14:56.167 --> 14:57.709
Well, are you going to say

14:57.710 --> 14:59.250
anything nice about me?

15:00.209 --> 15:02.709
You're a'ight.

15:02.751 --> 15:04.126
You know,

15:04.127 --> 15:05.500
I'm not so sure

15:02.751 --> 15:05.500
I like the new Stuart.

15:05.542 --> 15:08.000
What's not to like, babe?

15:08.042 --> 15:10.313
You used to be the one

15:10.314 --> 15:12.584
who did all the chasing,

15:08.042 --> 15:12.584
and now I'm doing that.

15:12.626 --> 15:13.668
And it is way

15:13.669 --> 15:14.709
too much work!

15:14.751 --> 15:16.001
I am a chasee,

15:16.002 --> 15:17.250
not a chaser!

15:17.292 --> 15:19.001
But, I thought you hated

15:19.002 --> 15:20.709
the way I used to

15:17.292 --> 15:20.709
come on so strong.

15:20.751 --> 15:22.938
(SIGHS) Look, just because

15:22.939 --> 15:25.125
a person doesn't want to

15:20.751 --> 15:25.125
go to the party

15:25.167 --> 15:26.522
doesn't mean

15:26.523 --> 15:27.876
they don't want

15:25.167 --> 15:27.876
to be invited.

15:27.918 --> 15:29.272
So, you're saying

15:29.273 --> 15:30.626
you really liked being

15:27.918 --> 15:30.626
worshipped?

15:30.667 --> 15:31.876
Duh.

15:31.918 --> 15:34.375
I want the old Stuart back.

15:34.417 --> 15:35.542
Really?

15:36.459 --> 15:37.459
Done.

15:44.709 --> 15:46.250
Whew! What a relief!

15:48.292 --> 15:50.000
- Welcome back,
- old friend.

15:50.959 --> 15:53.042
Welcome back, Stuart.

15:53.083 --> 15:54.563
Now, let's get

15:54.564 --> 15:56.042
this universe started.

15:56.083 --> 15:57.563
Okay, but the beauty

15:57.564 --> 15:59.042
of the heavens

15:59.083 --> 16:00.626
could never compare

16:00.627 --> 16:02.167
to the beauty right

15:59.083 --> 16:02.167
in front of me.

16:02.209 --> 16:03.376
Aw!

16:03.377 --> 16:04.542
That's more like it.

16:08.083 --> 16:09.792
(LOUD HUMMING)

16:09.834 --> 16:12.000
It's too loud!

16:12.042 --> 16:14.000
There are no clouds!

16:14.042 --> 16:16.209
This is about the Big Bang!

16:18.584 --> 16:19.584
(RUMBLING)

16:24.292 --> 16:25.417
Zuri?

16:26.751 --> 16:27.751
(SCREAMING)

16:31.083 --> 16:32.709
I am okay,

16:32.710 --> 16:34.334
but that bang was

16:31.083 --> 16:34.334
too big!

16:39.918 --> 16:40.918
(APPLAUSE)

16:41.834 --> 16:43.231
Bertram, how did Ravi's

16:43.232 --> 16:44.626
singing lessons go?

16:44.667 --> 16:46.501
Let's just say there are

16:46.502 --> 16:48.334
no flowers left alive

16:44.667 --> 16:48.334
in the penthouse.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.042
Ugh.

16:51.083 --> 16:52.542
Luke, any chance Ravi's

16:52.543 --> 16:54.000
dancing is going to knock

16:51.083 --> 16:54.000
the crowd off their feet?

16:54.042 --> 16:55.667
The only person getting

16:55.668 --> 16:57.292
knocked off his feet

16:54.042 --> 16:57.292
will be Ravi.

16:57.334 --> 16:59.709
Seriously, it's like

16:59.710 --> 17:02.083
he's dancing in swim fins!

17:02.125 --> 17:03.501
Well, hopefully

17:03.502 --> 17:04.876
he won't get the chance

17:02.125 --> 17:04.876
to embarrass himself.

17:04.917 --> 17:06.602
- Unless he's been
- secretly lifting weights,

17:06.626 --> 17:08.250
- He's never getting out
- of that egg.

17:10.041 --> 17:12.000
- ZURI: Help!
- I'm stuck.

17:13.083 --> 17:14.500
Help me.

17:14.541 --> 17:16.416
- I'm sorry, Zuri,
- it's too heavy!

17:16.459 --> 17:17.563
This is no job

17:17.564 --> 17:18.666
for a wordsmith!

17:18.709 --> 17:20.500
Then run and get help!

17:20.541 --> 17:22.251
Running is also

17:22.252 --> 17:23.959
no job for a wordsmith!

17:24.000 --> 17:25.021
Stuart, there you are!

17:25.022 --> 17:26.041
Where's Zuri?

17:26.083 --> 17:27.959
- She's under - the scaffolding!
- (GASPING)

17:28.000 --> 17:29.522
Fret not, my sweet,

17:29.523 --> 17:31.042
authority figures are here!

17:31.083 --> 17:33.000
- Someone get this
- off of me!

17:34.417 --> 17:35.439
You can't possibly

17:35.440 --> 17:36.459
lift that!

17:36.500 --> 17:37.918
(GRUNTING)

17:43.876 --> 17:45.000
How did you lift that?

17:45.918 --> 17:47.667
(SIGHS)

17:47.709 --> 17:49.059
- When one of my kids
- is in trouble,

17:49.083 --> 17:50.764
- My super-human nanny
- strength kicks in.

17:51.083 --> 17:53.459
Oh!

17:53.500 --> 17:54.751
I think

17:54.752 --> 17:56.000
your nanny strength

17:53.500 --> 17:56.000
is still kicking.

17:58.083 --> 17:59.313
Sorry. It's kinda

17:59.314 --> 18:00.542
hard to turn it off.

18:00.584 --> 18:02.042
- You should not
- have run away!

18:02.083 --> 18:03.042
You either, Stuart!

18:03.083 --> 18:05.042
You two are so grinded!

18:05.083 --> 18:07.334
He means grounded!

18:07.375 --> 18:08.522
Well, you left us

18:08.523 --> 18:09.667
no choice!

18:09.709 --> 18:10.876
Why should your

18:10.877 --> 18:12.042
petty squabbles

18:12.083 --> 18:13.772
get in the way of our

18:13.773 --> 18:15.459
resplendent love?

18:15.500 --> 18:16.543
I see Stuart 1.0

18:16.544 --> 18:17.584
is back.

18:17.626 --> 18:19.522
Which is actually good news,

18:19.523 --> 18:21.417
because I need someone

18:17.626 --> 18:21.417
to do my taxes.

18:21.459 --> 18:23.459
I am not fudging one

18:23.460 --> 18:25.459
deduction for you

18:21.459 --> 18:25.459
until you two make up,

18:25.500 --> 18:27.061
- so Zuri and I can
- hang out together.

18:28.083 --> 18:29.918
Well, Jessie...

18:29.919 --> 18:31.751
(CLEARS THROAT)

18:31.792 --> 18:34.146
Maybe you were right

18:34.147 --> 18:36.500
about me being

18:31.792 --> 18:36.500
a tad irresponsible.

18:36.542 --> 18:38.083
- A tad? You asked
- the zookeeper

18:38.125 --> 18:39.584
If Stuart could swim

18:39.585 --> 18:41.042
with the polar bears!

18:41.083 --> 18:43.042
Jessie, do you want

18:43.043 --> 18:45.000
to make nice,

18:41.083 --> 18:45.000
or do you want an audit?

18:45.959 --> 18:48.042
Okay, okay!

18:48.083 --> 18:49.522
I'm sorry that Hudson

18:49.523 --> 18:50.959
and I didn't think about

18:48.083 --> 18:50.959
your feelings.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.918
And...

18:52.959 --> 18:54.480
I'm sure he's not

18:54.481 --> 18:56.000
as irresponsible as

18:52.959 --> 18:56.000
I thought he was.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.042
Thank you, Jessie!

18:59.083 --> 19:01.313
(LAUGHING) Okay, who wants

19:01.314 --> 19:03.542
to go base jump off

18:59.083 --> 19:03.542
the Statue of Liberty?

19:03.584 --> 19:04.814
Great idea!

19:04.815 --> 19:06.042
Why don't I pack

19:03.584 --> 19:06.042
a parachute for you.

19:06.083 --> 19:07.876
- Well, thank you,
- Jessie!

19:12.083 --> 19:14.042
- Jessie,
- where have you been?

19:14.083 --> 19:16.000
- Well, you know - how I always
- Tell you kids,

19:16.042 --> 19:17.230
Never run off to a

19:17.231 --> 19:18.417
planetarium closed

19:16.042 --> 19:18.417
for renovations

19:18.459 --> 19:19.668
because tumbling

19:19.669 --> 19:20.876
scaffolding could crush

19:18.459 --> 19:20.876
you to death?

19:20.918 --> 19:22.000
No.

19:23.167 --> 19:25.000
- Well, apparently
- I should have.

19:26.042 --> 19:27.292
Has Ravi gone on yet?

19:27.334 --> 19:28.876
Well, the audience

19:28.877 --> 19:30.417
is still here, so...

19:27.334 --> 19:30.417
No.

19:33.083 --> 19:34.542
Ladies and gentlemen,

19:34.543 --> 19:36.000
my apologies.

19:36.042 --> 19:38.042
I will not be performing

19:38.043 --> 19:40.042
the song and dance routine

19:36.042 --> 19:40.042
listed in your program.

19:40.083 --> 19:41.563
I am not a singer,

19:41.564 --> 19:43.042
nor a dancer,

19:43.083 --> 19:44.542
nor someone capable of

19:44.543 --> 19:46.000
breaking through

19:43.083 --> 19:46.000
multi-ply material.

19:48.042 --> 19:49.876
My talent lies

19:49.918 --> 19:51.000
in being myself.

19:52.083 --> 19:53.251
Oh, no!

19:53.252 --> 19:54.417
He's going to be himself.

19:56.626 --> 19:58.273
And now, I give you

19:58.274 --> 19:59.918
the art of cup stacking.

19:59.959 --> 20:01.856
After this, the only way

20:01.857 --> 20:03.751
he'll be safe from noogies

19:59.959 --> 20:03.751
is if he's home-schooled.

20:03.792 --> 20:05.042
Not that safe.

20:06.751 --> 20:08.000
Hit it, Mrs. Kipling!

20:52.732 --> 20:53.876
to give this to?

20:56.083 --> 20:57.083
No, Ravi.

20:57.084 --> 20:58.083
It's yours.

20:56.083 --> 20:58.083
You won!

20:58.125 --> 21:00.876
Oh! I'm so proud of you!

21:00.918 --> 21:04.042
I won? I won! Oh, joy!

21:04.083 --> 21:05.542
So this what

21:05.543 --> 21:07.000
being popular feels like?

21:07.042 --> 21:08.126
No wonder Emma is

21:08.127 --> 21:09.209
always so bubbly.

21:10.959 --> 21:13.792
Congratulations, Ravi.

21:13.834 --> 21:14.834
I'm sorry I told you

21:14.835 --> 21:15.835
to change your act.

21:15.876 --> 21:17.355
And I'm sorry we tried to

21:17.356 --> 21:18.834
turn you into something

21:15.876 --> 21:18.834
you're not.

21:18.876 --> 21:19.960
And I'm sorry,

21:19.961 --> 21:21.042
I ever bothered to

21:18.876 --> 21:21.042

21:25.106 --> 21:26.125
are accepted.

21:26.167 --> 21:28.063
Hey, next year

21:28.064 --> 21:29.959
let us do a family act.

- in it, too.

that's sweet,

22:10.189 --> 22:11.250
needing them anymore.

22:12.669 --> 22:14.042

to be a nanny.

- you'll have to

it's not like she has

22:57.876 --> 23:00.959
any money up there.

- get her diary.
