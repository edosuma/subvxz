00:18.202 --> 00:20.202
Hello, I'd like to vote
for president, governor,

00:20.203 --> 00:23.403
and anything that will take money
away from our parks and libraries.

00:23.404 --> 00:26.069
Eh, use machine number three.

00:30.205 --> 00:32.104
Oh! I can't fit in the booth!

00:32.106 --> 00:34.641
Use the double-wide.

00:38.407 --> 00:41.907
Ooh! One of those
electronic voting dealies.

00:41.908 --> 00:44.248
One vote for McCain. Thank you.

00:45.709 --> 00:47.809
No, I want to vote for Obama.

00:47.810 --> 00:49.695
Two votes for McCain.

00:50.711 --> 00:52.011
Come on. It's time for a change!

00:52.012 --> 00:54.012
Three votes for McCain.

00:54.013 --> 00:55.013
No! No! No!

00:55.014 --> 00:57.679
Six votes for President McCain.

00:58.015 --> 01:00.515
Hey, I only meant one of
those votes for McCain.

01:00.516 --> 01:02.921
This machine is rigged.

01:05.316 --> 01:08.502
Must... tell.. President McCain.

01:08.718 --> 01:11.018
This doesn't happen
in America! Maybe Ohio!

01:11.019 --> 01:12.774
But not in America!

01:18.120 --> 01:19.420
I VOTED

01:45.323 --> 01:49.423
Okay, all I need is a
Christmas gift for Lisa.

01:49.424 --> 01:50.924
YOU FORGOT-ME-NOTS
THE LAST-MINUTE GIFT STORE

01:50.925 --> 01:54.435
I don't have time to read all that.

01:56.326 --> 02:02.126
Montreal Expos jersey. Somber String.
Jacks, no ball.

02:03.027 --> 02:04.727
And a Slunky ...
"IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING"

02:04.728 --> 02:06.528
Oh, I wouldn't give these
to my worst enemy, ...

02:06.529 --> 02:08.154
... which happens to be Lisa.

02:10.030 --> 02:15.035
Girls don't like trucks! Come
back when you're something else!

02:17.131 --> 02:18.231
Perfect!

02:20.532 --> 02:24.832
Merry Christmas, Dad. We bought
you three more minutes of oxygen.

02:24.833 --> 02:29.383
Oh, thank you, son! Can I play
with it outside? Can I?! Can I?!

02:30.234 --> 02:30.834
Sure.

02:42.035 --> 02:44.535
Hey, Lis, I think I see
one with your name on it.

02:44.536 --> 02:49.099
I don't know how you could top last
year's gift: a box of your burps.

02:49.100 --> 02:52.285
Yeah. Here's your stocking stuffer.

02:54.837 --> 02:57.937
Wow! A Malibu Stacey convertible!

02:57.938 --> 03:01.038
Oh, Bart, an actual present.

03:11.339 --> 03:14.524
That's right, Maggie.
It's a car.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.040
Let's go to the ....

03:33.541 --> 03:35.441
Pos-i-bots, transform!

03:38.042 --> 03:38.942
Snooze!

03:41.443 --> 03:42.243
Threeway!

03:46.244 --> 03:47.044
Melody!

03:50.645 --> 03:51.245
What?

03:55.646 --> 03:59.351
Wait a minute. We're missing Sex-Toy.

04:00.147 --> 04:01.707
Where have you been?

04:01.748 --> 04:03.763
Where haven't I been?

04:05.349 --> 04:07.169
CHRISTMAS OCCURS

04:08.950 --> 04:11.350
Hmm. Is there something
different about the kitchen?

04:11.351 --> 04:12.716
No! No! No!

04:15.052 --> 04:15.952
NO.

04:16.351 --> 04:20.576
Well, the toaster's
never lied to me before.

04:22.452 --> 04:23.557
Nice planet.

04:36.153 --> 04:37.353
Pos-i-bot, engage.

04:37.354 --> 04:40.254
Battle commencing in
ten, nine, eight ...

04:40.255 --> 04:41.255
Hey!

04:43.455 --> 04:44.955
Hey, Homer.
How was your Christmas?

04:44.956 --> 04:49.701
It was okay.
I got Seinfeld, Season 7.

04:50.357 --> 04:52.657
Finally a boxing day
that lives up to its name.

04:52.658 --> 04:54.958
Lisa! What's happening?!

04:54.959 --> 04:58.164
Well, if I had to guess, I'd
say that two alien robot races,

04:58.165 --> 04:59.860
who've been battling for centuries,

04:59.861 --> 05:03.661
... have chosen our planet as a site
for their ultimate confrontation.

05:03.662 --> 05:08.147
It is a good planet to settle things on.

05:18.163 --> 05:24.533
Stop it! Stop it! Look, you
have made the nacho machine cry.

05:26.864 --> 05:27.764
Cool!

05:30.165 --> 05:35.755
Carnage Destructicus, the moment
has arrived: our final battle.

05:36.166 --> 05:39.166
Your final battle, Bestimus Mucho!

05:41.767 --> 05:46.667
Just because you're mad at each other,
doesn't mean you have to destroy our town.

05:46.668 --> 05:47.768
That does not compute.

05:47.769 --> 05:48.969
Really?!

05:48.970 --> 05:51.070
It computes a little.

05:51.071 --> 05:53.471
What's this whole
intergalactic tiff about anyway?

05:53.472 --> 05:56.572
You know I, I...
I don't remember.

05:56.573 --> 05:58.173
Neither do I.

05:58.174 --> 06:01.574
Hmm. Maybe the
non-transforma thing is right.

06:01.575 --> 06:04.275
Thank you, human
grandmother, for pointing out

06:04.276 --> 06:06.975
that it is futile to fight
if we do not know why.

06:06.976 --> 06:09.226
And now that we are
not fighting each other,

06:09.227 --> 06:12.876
we can team up to enslave your planet.

06:12.877 --> 06:18.727
That's great! Because working
together, you can ... Oh ...

06:21.078 --> 06:24.178
Okay, who's the idiot who
taught them what foosball was?

06:24.179 --> 06:27.949
I thought they might enjoy it.

07:03.780 --> 07:06.250
HOW TO GET AHEAD IN DEAD-VERTISING

CRAZY ETHEL'S DAY CARE CENTER

07:14.082 --> 07:16.982
Okay, Maggie, we'll
be back in three hours.

07:16.983 --> 07:19.983
Or longer if something
happens to us.

07:24.084 --> 07:28.710
Maybe we shouldn't do this.
She doesn't know anyone here.

07:28.711 --> 07:33.261
Look, sweetie, there's
a familiar face: Krusty!

07:45.171 --> 07:49.170
Hey, hey, kids! Your old pal Krusty's
gonna teach you five new words:

07:49.171 --> 07:52.226
Unlicensed use of my image.

07:54.771 --> 07:59.500
All right, boys. See those
Krustys nobody paid me for?

07:59.501 --> 08:01.270
Sandblast them!

08:06.571 --> 08:11.470
Entertain the troops? No way!
What have they ever done for me?!

08:11.471 --> 08:14.070
Krusty, you made my daughter cry!

08:14.071 --> 08:17.020
Hey, my intellectual property
rights were being infringed.

08:17.021 --> 08:22.156
Do you know how that feels?
Do ya?! Huh?! Do ya?!

08:37.071 --> 08:40.570
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

08:41.071 --> 08:42.970
Oh! It's no use.

08:49.071 --> 08:53.270
Mr. Simpson, you have quite a
talent for killing celebrities.

08:53.271 --> 08:56.270
Well ... I'm no drunk driving.

08:56.271 --> 08:59.870
I'd like to introduce you
to some stereotypical ad men.

08:59.871 --> 09:01.670
Simpson, we got a swell
little notion for you.

09:01.671 --> 09:03.510
Did you know you can
put a dead celebrity

09:03.511 --> 09:08.971
in a commercial and you don't
have to pay them a thing?

09:17.671 --> 09:20.770
Oh, my God, you finally did it.

09:20.771 --> 09:25.870
You mixed Buzz Cola with the
smooth, rich taste of lemon.

09:25.971 --> 09:29.270
Unfortunately, there are certain
stars who won't do what we want.

09:29.271 --> 09:31.170
What's their problem?

09:31.671 --> 09:33.370
They're still alive.

09:33.371 --> 09:36.570
And then we thought ...
"Who's good at killing celebrities?"

09:36.571 --> 09:37.870
Me!

09:38.071 --> 09:39.370
That's right.

09:39.571 --> 09:42.070
Homer, would you be willing
to acquire some more, um ...

09:42.071 --> 09:44.216
... uh, accounts for us?

09:44.871 --> 09:48.670
Well, you know,
it is awfully hot today.

09:52.871 --> 09:55.670
Now I'm too cold.

10:58.171 --> 11:03.170
Hey, John Wayne, have you heard about
stockswapper.org's low, low transaction fees?

11:03.171 --> 11:09.996
Sounds ... like ... quite ... a ... deal ... pilgrim!
I hate ... trans ... action ... fees!

11:10.971 --> 11:16.041
Hey, George Washington, see
if you think this is funny!

11:18.271 --> 11:24.121
It's the Springfield Wedding Chapel's
annual President's Day marriage-a-thon!!

11:25.271 --> 11:30.570
That ad implies that Mr. Lincoln
and I are... betraying familiarities!

11:30.571 --> 11:32.261
It's an outrage!

11:32.671 --> 11:34.621
Yes, uh, an outrage ...

11:38.671 --> 11:41.770
So, are we gonna sit
here flapping our jaws,

11:41.771 --> 11:45.021
... or are we gonna
do something about it?

11:46.571 --> 11:49.070
Now wait just a gosh-darn minute here!

11:49.071 --> 11:52.470
We can't go taking the
law into our own hands.

11:52.471 --> 11:55.890
These are people with hopes
and dreams and-and, uh ...

11:55.891 --> 11:57.970
Put a sock in it, mushmouth!

12:13.649 --> 12:17.809
Winslet paid for that
chocolate fountain.

12:26.891 --> 12:28.970
G- g-golda Meir!

12:34.091 --> 12:35.790
Ah, you ripped me off. See?

12:35.791 --> 12:37.590
No, I didn't. See!

12:37.591 --> 12:41.290
You're gonna pay for what you done. See!

12:41.291 --> 12:46.881
I always thought I'd
die of hepatitis ... C.

12:47.291 --> 12:50.216
Rip Taylor? You're not even dead!

12:50.291 --> 12:53.866
Someone needs to check my apartment.

12:58.691 --> 12:59.990
Let's get him!

12:59.991 --> 13:03.790
Little Sister, is that
moustache comin' or goin'?

13:03.791 --> 13:05.741
Well, your wife likes it.

13:08.791 --> 13:11.390
You're all right, Goofy Grape.

13:11.391 --> 13:14.190
People, please.
We're here to kill this jerk.

13:14.191 --> 13:18.090
Before you kill me, I gotta know ...
what is the one true religion?

13:18.091 --> 13:21.926
It's a mix of voodoo and Methodist.

13:25.091 --> 13:27.890
Shouldn't have left the
key under the mat, suckers!

13:27.891 --> 13:30.000
So what do you do for fun around here?

13:30.001 --> 13:33.700
Well, tonight we've got a poker
tournament at the rec center.

13:33.701 --> 13:36.236
Ooh! After you, Mr. Pennyface.

13:36.801 --> 13:38.500
Is your wife up here?

13:38.501 --> 13:42.401
Well, uh, we have an understanding ...

14:05.501 --> 14:08.166
IT'S THE GREAT PUPKIN, MILHOUSE

14:30.571 --> 14:32.066
Good grief.

14:33.172 --> 14:35.772
I like your witch costume, Lisa.

14:35.773 --> 14:38.273
I'm not a witch.
I'm a Wiccan.

14:38.274 --> 14:42.774
Why is it when a woman is confident
and powerful, they call her a witch?

14:42.775 --> 14:48.105
- What did you say, Mom?
- Nothing. I'm practicing my trombone.

14:48.376 --> 14:51.376
So, what are you wearing to
the Halloween party, Milhouse?

14:51.377 --> 14:55.277
I'm not going to the party. I'm going
to the pumpkin patch to wait for ...

14:55.278 --> 14:57.400
... the Grand Pumpkin!

14:58.700 --> 15:01.999
That means you kids have fun!

15:02.000 --> 15:03.992
What's the Grand Pumpkin?

15:03.993 --> 15:09.623
Every Halloween, the Grand Pumpkin visits
all the pumpkin patches in the world

15:09.624 --> 15:12.940
and brings candy to
kids who truly believe!

15:12.941 --> 15:17.166
Milhouse, for the last time, I
made that up to mess with you.

15:17.167 --> 15:19.140
The Grand Pumpkin isn't real!

15:19.141 --> 15:23.294
I appreciate you testing my faith,
Bart, but it's not necessary.

15:23.295 --> 15:25.746
I believe in the Grand
Pumpkin, almighty gourd,

15:25.747 --> 15:28.835
who was crustified over Pontius
Pie-plate, and ascended into oven.

15:28.836 --> 15:33.724
He will come again to judge
the filling and the bread ...

15:33.725 --> 15:34.725
Sigh.

15:39.037 --> 15:41.955
You've all come to wait for
the Grand Pumpkin with me!

15:41.956 --> 15:43.955
Who wants to sing pumpkin carols?

15:43.956 --> 15:46.556
I've got a pumpkin carol for you!

15:47.353 --> 15:50.999
<i>You are such a stupid moron!
It makes people want to punch you!</i>

15:51.000 --> 15:57.000
<i>The Grand Pumpkin's superga-ay!
Punch, punch, punch, punch, wedgie!</i>

15:59.428 --> 16:01.184
Your god is wrong!

16:01.165 --> 16:02.558
Let's get to the Halloween party.

16:02.559 --> 16:05.443
I want to hit the apple tank before
all the Granny Smiths are bobbed out.

16:05.444 --> 16:06.491
Lis, you comin'?

16:06.492 --> 16:11.104
Eh, I think I'll stay with Milhouse.
His glasses fog up when he cries.

16:11.105 --> 16:14.420
More Granny Smiths for me.

16:20.487 --> 16:22.850
Lisa, Lisa, wake up!
He's here!

16:22.851 --> 16:25.369
What?
Your Grand Pumpkin is here?!

16:25.370 --> 16:28.400
No. I'm rehearsing what I'm
gonna say when he shows up.

16:28.401 --> 16:31.521
He's here! He's here! He is here!

16:34.669 --> 16:37.399
You owe me restitution!

16:37.559 --> 16:43.223
If he sees us fighting,
he might not come.

16:43.224 --> 16:49.854
Grand Pumpkin, I know you're real.
Why won't you show yourself?! Why?

17:00.818 --> 17:02.676
Happy Halloween!

17:03.288 --> 17:07.645
The Grand Pumpkin!
You are real!

17:08.047 --> 17:13.571
That's right, Milhouse. Your childlike
belief has brought me to life!

17:13.970 --> 17:18.963
I knew you'd come! I even baked you
a loaf of homemade pumpkin bread!

17:18.964 --> 17:23.904
Oh, how delightful-- bread
made especially for pumpkins.

17:26.755 --> 17:30.005
Actually, it's made from pumpkins.

17:34.756 --> 17:37.061
Revenge!

17:42.457 --> 17:45.508
I'm gonna give you crossed eyes
like you might see on an idiot,

17:45.509 --> 17:52.609
a stupid triangle nose and a big mouth full of
the ugliest shaped teeth there are ... square.

17:53.010 --> 17:57.105
And I'm gonna make your friends watch.

18:00.075 --> 18:02.637
Noooo!!!

18:06.038 --> 18:09.043
Ladies. Stupid ...

18:20.376 --> 18:23.762
Everybody, listen!
The Grand Pumpkin is real!

18:23.763 --> 18:27.403
Hey! No hard-soled shoes!

18:29.823 --> 18:34.978
Oh, God! Everywhere I
look-- pumpkin atrocities!!

18:29.730 --> 18:37.541
Care for a pumpkin seed?

18:38.803 --> 18:41.338
You roast the unborn?

18:45.843 --> 18:47.790
Touch me and I'll cut your friend!

18:47.791 --> 18:51.352
What do I care?
That's a yellow pumpkin.

18:51.353 --> 18:52.978
You're a racist!

18:53.012 --> 18:58.407
All pumpkins are racist.
The difference is I admit it!

18:58.542 --> 18:59.939
I'd rather die than hate!

18:59.940 --> 19:01.610
This is all my fault!

19:01.611 --> 19:06.022
The Grand Pumpkin said my childlike
belief was what made him come to life!

19:06.023 --> 19:07.210
Belief, eh?

19:09.187 --> 19:13.480
Say, Milhouse, have you by any
chance ever heard of "Tom Turkey"?

19:13.481 --> 19:15.836
No. Who is he and
what's his origin story?

19:15.837 --> 19:19.453
Um ... well, Tom is a magical
turkey who gave the pilgrims

19:19.454 --> 19:22.241
the technology to put
buckles on their hats.

19:22.242 --> 19:25.765
Now he appears every Thanksgiving
to children who believe.

19:25.766 --> 19:27.260
Sounds plausible.

19:27.261 --> 19:30.813
Tom Turkey, help me.
I believe in you.

19:31.489 --> 19:35.974
Are you looking for a particular
part of my brain or ...

19:37.013 --> 19:43.906
Halt, yon pumperkin most succulent
and plump! I be Tom Turkey!

19:44.404 --> 19:48.460
A giant talking turkey?
Preposterous!

19:48.868 --> 19:56.343
Prepare for the Almighty's judgement,
thou stinking fruit of rotted vine!

19:58.546 --> 20:01.203
Pumpkin segregation forever!

20:05.107 --> 20:09.787
I can't live on the outside.
I can't!

20:12.046 --> 20:15.425
Milhouse, your childlike
innocence saved us all!

20:15.426 --> 20:17.038
Tom, how can we repay you?

20:17.039 --> 20:19.293
How about a Thanksgiving feast?

20:19.294 --> 20:21.587
You can carve the turkey.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.500
You eat turkeys?!

20:23.989 --> 20:26.134
Oh, yeah.
It's delicious!

20:26.186 --> 20:29.706
Especially when we take stuffing
and shove it up the turkey's ...

20:29.707 --> 20:31.971
Revenge!!!!

20:37.518 --> 20:41.049
Looks like those kids found
the true spirit of Halloween.

20:41.050 --> 20:43.966
Or Thanksgiving. Or whatever.

20:43.967 --> 20:48.459
And for those of you who feel like we've
trampled on a beloved children's classic,

20:48.460 --> 20:52.688
I encourage you to write
to the following address.

20:52.689 --> 20:54.734
Happy Holidays, everyone!
