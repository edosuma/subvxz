Jeannie, you'll
turn to dust!

22:18.905 --> 22:20.204
    Oh, there you are.

22:20.239 --> 22:21.872
        I've been looking
        everywhere for you.

22:21.907 --> 22:22.873
             Oh, Tony!

22:22.908 --> 22:24.107
                Wha-- What about
                   your oath?

22:24.143 --> 22:25.976
Oh, I'm free
of my oath be--

22:26.979 --> 22:29.580
Because I am
no longer your genie.

22:29.615 --> 22:31.581
         What do you mean
    you're no longer my genie?

22:31.617 --> 22:33.083
            What she's trying to
               say is, buddy,

22:33.119 --> 22:35.919
      that she has a new master,
      and you're looking at him.

22:35.955 --> 22:38.088
Now you will give the bottle
back to Captain Nelson.

22:39.391 --> 22:41.324
         why would I want to do
       a stupid thing like that?

22:41.360 --> 22:42.993
What is more
important to you?

22:43.029 --> 22:45.395
A new car, or saving
your friend's life?

22:45.430 --> 22:47.064
           What kind of new car?

22:47.099 --> 22:49.199
                   Oh, I--
             I was only kidding.

22:50.736 --> 22:51.935
             I guess she could

             to anybody else.

Oh, thank you.

22:57.477 --> 22:59.042
              Hey, we'd better
           get back to the base.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.660
         I've seen things
    like this before, general,

23:16.695 --> 23:18.962
          but never in such
          an advanced stage.

23:18.998 --> 23:20.764
              My suggestion
                 is, uh,

23:20.799 --> 23:22.233
              that they be given
               a complete rest

23:22.268 --> 23:24.168
                of at least
               three months.

                     I'm sorry
                  I'm late, sir.

             Uh, no, sir.
          It's-- It's, uh--

23:28.073 --> 23:29.607
             it's my fault.

23:29.642 --> 23:31.942
       I-- I was working home,
      and I got so carried away

23:31.977 --> 23:33.076
             I lost all track
                 of time.

23:33.112 --> 23:34.911
                I really
             must apologize.

23:34.947 --> 23:36.613
     You've been at home
        all this time?

23:37.183 --> 23:38.381
    Well...

23:38.417 --> 23:40.417
         Tell him about
   the Chinese secret agents

23:40.452 --> 23:41.718
 who were holding him prisoner.

23:41.754 --> 23:45.456
Uh...Chinese secret agents
holding me prisoner?

You weren't being held prisoner?

    the beautiful princess?

23:50.096 --> 23:51.628
  The ringleader of the spies?

23:51.663 --> 23:53.230
Did you tell him
about that?

23:53.265 --> 23:54.598
          DR. BELLOWS:
       He certainly did.

23:54.633 --> 23:57.100
      And he told me about
 the submarine and drugged tea.

23:57.135 --> 23:58.401
You shouldn't have
done that.

23:58.437 --> 23:59.836
That was supposed
to be a secret.

24:21.426 --> 24:23.594
you know that
three months' rest

24:23.629 --> 24:24.895
that we were
talking about?

that's long enough.

Make it six months.

         Well, that's a splendid
              idea, general.

immediately, doctor.
