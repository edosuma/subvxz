he thought of a-a flamingo,

26:35.419 --> 26:37.421

all of a sudden, so he used it

26:37.465 --> 26:38.814
as a baseball bat, and he...

26:38.858 --> 26:40.642
he whacked the Sandman
to the sun.

26:40.686 --> 26:43.166
That was actually kind of cool,
right? But my point is is that

26:43.210 --> 26:45.299
he killed the Sandman
in his dream.
