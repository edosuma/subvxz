00:41.975 --> 00:44.043
Â¶

01:08.168 --> 01:11.570
(gasping)

01:11.572 --> 01:13.338
(screams)

01:13.340 --> 01:15.874
Poor freakish thing,

01:15.876 --> 01:17.042
There is no escape.

01:17.044 --> 01:19.411
Not until all questions
have been answered.

01:19.413 --> 01:22.748
By you, and by all
upon whom I would call.

01:24.084 --> 01:27.219
For I have been summoned
to this place.

01:27.221 --> 01:30.289
<i>Driven, like percival,</i>
<i>to find a thing most rare.</i>

01:38.198 --> 01:40.032
<i>Though the grail I seek</i>
<i>is one of flesh.</i>

01:40.034 --> 01:41.700
<i>Corrupted. Diseased.</i>

01:41.702 --> 01:43.869
<i>Perfect in its monstrous</i>
<i>imperfection.</i>

01:43.871 --> 01:47.406
Before this night is through,
I will find my grail.

01:47.408 --> 01:51.143
One more pure freak to add
to our unhappy number.

01:52.445 --> 01:54.179
Now...

01:56.549 --> 01:59.118
Tell me, dear one,

01:59.120 --> 02:01.186
How did you come to be here?

02:02.055 --> 02:04.123
I committed a sin.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.092
Give us your sin.

02:07.094 --> 02:09.094
Paul:
<i>That's easy, isn't it?</i>

02:09.096 --> 02:11.430
I was born.

02:11.432 --> 02:12.931
As all men must be.

02:12.933 --> 02:16.235
Only I weren't
like all other men.

02:16.237 --> 02:19.071
In our street,
that was a problem.

02:19.073 --> 02:22.908
Lads learned early on
how to scrap.

02:22.910 --> 02:25.144
Only I couldn't get
close enough to scrap back,

02:25.146 --> 02:27.146
Not with these.

02:27.148 --> 02:28.447
Suzi:
The doctors
took my legs

02:28.449 --> 02:29.781
When I was
two years old,

02:29.783 --> 02:31.183
Owing to a
spinal condition.

02:32.752 --> 02:36.088
After that,
my parents lost faith.

02:36.090 --> 02:38.590
They left me in a basket

02:38.592 --> 02:40.259
On the doorstep
of the children's home.

02:40.261 --> 02:43.095
I never saw
them again.

02:43.097 --> 02:45.297
(indistinct whispering)

02:45.299 --> 02:46.999
A sad story, but common.

02:47.001 --> 02:48.467
You do not amuse, girl.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.602
Make me weep tears
of sorrow for you.

02:50.604 --> 02:53.138
<i>Lay bare your greatest shame.</i>

02:53.140 --> 02:54.773
Play with us!

02:54.775 --> 02:57.276
Oh, my innocent ones.

02:57.278 --> 02:58.944
How you move
my heart.

02:58.946 --> 03:01.513
There can be no shame with you.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.981
No shame.

03:02.983 --> 03:05.017
Paul:
<i>My whole life is shame.</i>

03:06.186 --> 03:08.120
My only escape was in the dark.

03:08.122 --> 03:10.022
<i>I could lose myself in it.</i>

03:10.024 --> 03:12.357
<i>There I was transported.</i>

03:12.359 --> 03:14.693
<i>I wanted nothing more than</i>
<i>to come to this land</i>

03:14.695 --> 03:16.962
<i>Of opulence and glamour.</i>

03:16.964 --> 03:19.698
But when I arrived,
it was the depression.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.434
The country's... And mine.

03:25.138 --> 03:27.906
Suzi:
<i>After the children's home,</i>
<i>I ended up on the streets.</i>

03:29.309 --> 03:31.310
<i>There was no work</i>
<i>for someone like me.</i>

03:31.312 --> 03:34.012
<i>Hell, there was no work</i>
<i>for anyone at that time.</i>

03:34.014 --> 03:36.215
The darkest moment, girl.

03:36.217 --> 03:37.149
We would have it.

03:37.151 --> 03:38.717
It was jealousy.

03:42.222 --> 03:45.057
<i>Even hate.</i>

03:45.059 --> 03:47.125
<i>He didn't deserve it.</i>

03:49.329 --> 03:51.163
(screams)

03:51.165 --> 03:54.032
<i>And I guess I hit an artery.</i>

03:54.034 --> 03:57.035
I didn't think of those
legs as part of him.

03:57.037 --> 03:59.404
Just the things that
I would never have.

04:00.173 --> 04:02.074
He died.

04:02.076 --> 04:03.842
Yes.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.911
But he inspired you to perform.

04:06.879 --> 04:08.580
He did.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.582
And I was tired
of the streets.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.217
Paul:
<i>Tired of being laughed at,</i>

04:12.219 --> 04:16.221
Of being attacked,
of being called "seal boy."

04:16.223 --> 04:19.258
The world hated me.

04:19.260 --> 04:21.927
But no more than I hated myself.

04:23.863 --> 04:26.198
They wanted a monster?

04:26.200 --> 04:28.267
I decided to give them one.

04:32.705 --> 04:35.374
I could never make
the world love me.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.442
<i>Maybe I could make it fear me.</i>

04:40.380 --> 04:41.213
Why not the face?

04:41.215 --> 04:43.382
Paul:
<i>I thought about it.</i>

04:43.384 --> 04:46.051
But at the last minute,
I chickened out.

04:46.053 --> 04:48.186
Why?

04:50.723 --> 04:53.792
'cause I have a handsome face.

04:56.929 --> 04:58.630
I have the face of a pretty lad.

04:58.632 --> 05:01.333
Can you imagine this mug
on a normal body?

05:03.269 --> 05:04.903
I could've ruled the world.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.972
(indistinct whispering)

05:13.246 --> 05:15.814
You are not the one.

05:19.452 --> 05:23.121
There is another,
my children.

05:23.123 --> 05:25.524
Another visit I must make.

05:36.936 --> 05:38.470
Maestro?

05:38.472 --> 05:40.305
<i>Willkommen.</i>

05:40.307 --> 05:42.974
I hope I'm not disturbing you,
fraulein.

05:42.976 --> 05:44.276
Oh, not at all.

05:44.278 --> 05:45.677
I have been
expecting you.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.279
Although it was
rather rude of you

05:47.281 --> 05:49.715
To run off like that
after my number.

05:50.683 --> 05:52.517
Perhaps you needed to...

05:52.519 --> 05:55.787
Collect yourself.

05:55.789 --> 05:58.423
I imagine you don't see such
authentic talent very often.

06:01.294 --> 06:03.362
May I sit?

06:05.698 --> 06:08.667
It would be better over there.

06:08.669 --> 06:11.636
We have business to discuss.

06:11.638 --> 06:13.972
And you wouldn't be
the first young man to show up

06:13.974 --> 06:16.041
Expecting
a lesson in love.

06:22.148 --> 06:25.884
Are you going to say something
about my number?

06:25.886 --> 06:29.988
I've been trying out
some new phrasing,

06:29.990 --> 06:33.558
Though it is a challenge for
an artist like myself to work

06:33.560 --> 06:35.327
With such run-of-the-mill
accompaniment.

06:35.329 --> 06:38.830
I suppose I should
consider myself lucky

06:38.832 --> 06:42.334
That there is at least
one freak on the circuit

06:42.336 --> 06:45.370
Who knows how
to read music.

06:45.372 --> 06:48.840
They are not known
for their culture.

06:48.842 --> 06:51.376
Which is something
we should discuss.

06:51.378 --> 06:53.912
I'm going to need a new arranger

06:53.914 --> 06:58.483
If I am to develop
a contemporary nightclub act.

07:04.524 --> 07:06.324
Cat got your tongue?

07:07.360 --> 07:09.861
My talent has been
known to render

07:09.863 --> 07:13.398
Men speechless,
but you'll have to get over it

07:13.400 --> 07:16.268
If we are going
to work together.

07:19.038 --> 07:22.073
It is not your talent
that renders me speechless.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.443
It is your delusional ignorance.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.379
Excuse me?

07:27.381 --> 07:30.081
You are a tattered
waste of oxygen

07:30.083 --> 07:32.083
Who bolsters herself
with contempt for others.

07:32.085 --> 07:34.386
I am not here to take you on
to greatness, woman.

07:34.388 --> 07:37.055
I am here to take someone
with me to the other side,

07:37.057 --> 07:39.558
Perhaps you.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.425
Get out of my tent!

07:40.427 --> 07:42.294
This is not amusing.

07:46.399 --> 07:50.402
Whoever it is under that mask,

07:50.404 --> 07:52.404
You've come to the wrong tent

07:52.406 --> 07:54.639
For your silly little
Halloween prank.

07:56.442 --> 07:58.877
This isn't a prank, my lovely.

08:05.251 --> 08:06.318
No!

08:06.320 --> 08:08.820
(screams) I am their guardian!

08:08.822 --> 08:11.089
I'm their minder!
I'm not one of them!

08:11.091 --> 08:12.424
I'm not... Don't!

08:12.426 --> 08:14.559
Don't, don't, don't.

08:15.595 --> 08:18.129
I don't understand.

08:18.131 --> 08:21.666
(crying):
I am not one of them.

08:23.603 --> 08:26.938
Oh, I understand.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.808
There is nothing more craven
than a freak like yourself.

08:29.810 --> 08:32.010
Someone who would pretend
to be the benevolent zookeeper,

08:32.012 --> 08:33.778
But she is nothing

08:33.780 --> 08:37.516
But a pernicious,
diseased animal herself.

08:38.851 --> 08:40.519
Now...

08:41.954 --> 08:45.190
...Tell me
all about your darkest hour.

10:01.534 --> 10:04.002
(engine sputtering to stop)

10:05.771 --> 10:08.039
(jimmy groans softly)

10:08.041 --> 10:09.808
What happened?

10:12.578 --> 10:14.713
I think we
ran out of gas.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.581
You think I was
born yesterday?

10:16.583 --> 10:20.051
What's next? Do you want to go
for a stroll in the woods?

10:20.053 --> 10:22.954
Yeah, actually.
We have to get off the road.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.422
There's a curfew.

10:24.424 --> 10:26.591
Unless you want to spend
the night in jail,

10:26.593 --> 10:28.693
We have to hide
from the cops.

10:31.063 --> 10:33.131
You coming?

10:33.133 --> 10:34.766
(crickets chirping)

10:34.768 --> 10:36.401
Come on, let's go.

10:36.403 --> 10:37.902
We got to get off the road.
Let's go.

10:37.904 --> 10:40.572
Come on.
Don't-don't touch me!

10:40.574 --> 10:42.240
I haven't decided about you.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.942
Well, you're a fortune teller--

10:43.944 --> 10:45.944
Can't you tell my intentions?
That's the problem.

10:45.946 --> 10:47.746
I know every guy's intentions.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.414
(chuckles) well, sassy,

10:49.416 --> 10:50.749
Lucky for you,
you're not my type.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.083
I'm also smart enough
to know that

10:52.085 --> 10:53.618
Guys aren't so picky
in the dark.

10:53.620 --> 10:55.954
Listen, I'm not the one
you have to worry about, toots.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.288
It's the townies, the cops.

10:57.290 --> 10:58.957
Do you have any idea
how much they hate us?

10:58.959 --> 11:01.593
At best, we're tolerated because
we make them feel grateful

11:01.595 --> 11:02.794
They're normal.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.529
So let me
get this straight.

11:05.631 --> 11:07.699
A pretty face is not your type?

11:09.001 --> 11:11.302
(vehicle approaching)
shit. Come on.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.672
We got to go.
Let's go.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.548
Am I gonna die?

11:24.617 --> 11:26.751
Listen to me.

11:30.489 --> 11:32.524
I'm not gonna die here,

11:32.526 --> 11:34.559
And neither are you.

11:36.796 --> 11:38.997
Is he dead?

11:38.999 --> 11:40.298
No.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.900
He's just weak
from hunger.

11:43.636 --> 11:46.538
The clown makes us watch him,
but he doesn't feed us.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.774
Watch him do what?

11:51.343 --> 11:53.411
Clown stuff.

11:55.848 --> 11:57.716
Come here.
I need you to help me.

11:57.718 --> 12:00.952
I need you to help me
untie this knot.

12:04.323 --> 12:05.890
Come on. Just try.
I can't.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.426
It's too tight.
Look, I need you to just try.

12:09.695 --> 12:11.563
Oh, come on. Hurry.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.733
There. There.

12:17.837 --> 12:19.070
(door creaks, bangs open)

12:19.872 --> 12:21.740
(breathing hard)

12:27.513 --> 12:30.415
(keys rattling)

12:56.108 --> 12:58.576
(bonnie grunts)

12:58.578 --> 12:59.811
(twisted clown squealing)

13:04.750 --> 13:07.085
There's only been one car
in the last ten minutes.

13:07.087 --> 13:10.121
Can't we just
walk back to camp?

13:10.123 --> 13:12.924
When you're right,
you're right.

13:12.926 --> 13:14.793
Just in case, let's
stay in the shadows.

13:17.396 --> 13:18.730
Let's go this way.

13:18.732 --> 13:19.764
(woman screams)

13:19.766 --> 13:21.966
Help me! Help!

13:21.968 --> 13:23.234
Shh. Get down.

13:23.236 --> 13:25.303
(screaming)

13:25.305 --> 13:27.005
No! No!

13:39.752 --> 13:41.820
What was that?

13:41.822 --> 13:42.987
Nothing good.

13:50.596 --> 13:51.930
Where are you going?

13:51.932 --> 13:54.766
See if I can help her.

13:54.768 --> 13:56.167
Well...

13:57.770 --> 14:00.338
Shit.

14:05.110 --> 14:07.679
Thank you for these.

14:09.181 --> 14:11.783
I prefer to be upright

14:11.785 --> 14:13.852
When I'm entertaining
a handsome stranger--

14:13.854 --> 14:16.621
At least, when we start.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.156
I am not a man anymore.

14:18.158 --> 14:19.457
You cannot play on

14:19.459 --> 14:20.859
My appetites
for mercy.

14:20.861 --> 14:21.960
He is in
charge now.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.828
He feeds off pain, regret,

14:23.830 --> 14:25.830
The delicious moment
when hope is lost,

14:25.832 --> 14:28.299
The sweet bleeding
of a broken heart.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.468
Do you want to hear
about marlene?

14:30.470 --> 14:32.971
He wants your misery.

14:32.973 --> 14:35.039
He wants the true darkness.

14:37.309 --> 14:39.143
(footsteps echoing)

14:39.145 --> 14:41.212
Â¶

14:42.314 --> 14:43.882
(grunting)

14:43.884 --> 14:46.517
Elsa:
<i>Berlin. 1932.</i>

14:46.519 --> 14:48.686
Woman:
No... No!

14:48.688 --> 14:51.055
Elsa:
<i>It was said you could get</i>
<i>the blow job of your life</i>

14:51.057 --> 14:53.391
<i>For an american nickel.</i>

14:53.393 --> 14:54.759
<i>It was sexual chaos.</i>

14:55.995 --> 14:57.996
All of the pain and humiliation

14:57.998 --> 14:59.831
<i>Of germany's surrender,</i>
<i>the anger...</i>

14:59.833 --> 15:03.167
<i>Before there was hitler</i>
<i>to channel it into another war,</i>

15:03.169 --> 15:04.736
<i>The citizens of germany</i>

15:04.738 --> 15:06.504
<i>Expressed their misery</i>
<i>with their cocks.</i>

15:06.506 --> 15:08.740
Any deviance you could imagine,

15:08.742 --> 15:10.041
<i>You could have.</i>

15:10.043 --> 15:12.744
<i>Animals, scat,</i>

15:12.746 --> 15:14.812
<i>Amputees, hunchbacks...</i>

15:16.415 --> 15:18.850
<i>And in the darkest</i>
<i>corner of it all,</i>

15:18.852 --> 15:20.151
<i>I found myself.</i>

15:27.359 --> 15:29.260
<i>Ne.</i>

15:29.262 --> 15:32.430
No?

15:34.533 --> 15:36.267
<i>Ne.</i>

15:43.275 --> 15:46.044
<i>Ja.</i>
<i>Woof.</i>

15:46.046 --> 15:49.547
<i>Unable to find work</i>
<i>on the stage, starving.</i>

15:49.549 --> 15:52.383
<i>But even in that world,</i>
<i>I was a star.</i>

15:52.385 --> 15:54.719
<i>I was a</i> minette, <i>a french cat.</i>

15:54.721 --> 15:57.055
<i>I worked only</i>
<i>at the top hotels.</i>

15:57.057 --> 15:59.958
<i>But I wasn't like the rest</i>
<i>of those whores.</i>

15:59.960 --> 16:02.060
<i>I never let</i>
<i>my clients touch me,</i>

16:02.062 --> 16:03.962
<i>Let alone put their filth</i>
<i>inside of me.</i>

16:03.964 --> 16:05.596
(shouting)

16:05.598 --> 16:07.398
<i>I gained a reputation</i>
<i>for being the one you went to</i>

16:07.400 --> 16:08.800
<i>When you were looking</i>
<i>for something...</i>

16:09.601 --> 16:11.135
<i>...Creative.</i>

16:12.905 --> 16:16.240
<i>No one puts on a show better</i>
<i>than I do.</i>

16:16.242 --> 16:19.577
(moaning)

16:19.579 --> 16:23.481
(speaking german)

16:31.123 --> 16:33.191
(speaking german)

16:37.763 --> 16:39.998
(moaning)

16:44.803 --> 16:47.939
<i>And in time,</i>
<i>I began to attract clients.</i>

16:47.941 --> 16:50.008
<i>And an audience.</i>

16:53.112 --> 16:55.780
<i>I called them the watchers.</i>

16:55.782 --> 16:58.950
<i>I never knew their names,</i>
<i>but they paid well,</i>

16:58.952 --> 17:02.020
<i>And never in marks.</i>

17:05.858 --> 17:08.626
You trade away your humanity

17:08.628 --> 17:11.162
Trick by trick.

17:11.164 --> 17:13.164
In the end,

17:13.166 --> 17:15.800
I wasn't elsa.

17:15.802 --> 17:18.803
I was nothing.

17:18.805 --> 17:21.039
A ghost. Like you.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.476
I came all this way
to hear your story.

17:25.478 --> 17:28.346
I told you it.
Not the worst
of it.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.081
Tell me about your legs.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.154
(sighs)

17:36.156 --> 17:38.423
(crickets chirping)

17:44.863 --> 17:47.031
(whispering):
Stay here.

17:47.033 --> 17:48.699
No way.
Stay.

17:48.701 --> 17:50.068
No.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.739
(door shuts)

17:57.009 --> 17:59.577
(gasps)

18:11.190 --> 18:13.891
Holy shit.
What?

18:13.893 --> 18:16.194
Those are the missing kids.
This is the guy.

18:16.196 --> 18:17.361
This is the killer.

18:17.363 --> 18:18.863
He's a maniac.

18:18.865 --> 18:22.100
We got to get the cops.

18:22.102 --> 18:23.101
(screams, grunts)

18:27.739 --> 18:31.442
Time for the real Halloween show
to begin.

18:42.054 --> 18:44.122
Elsa:
<i>My ambition was my downfall.</i>

18:46.558 --> 18:49.227
<i>The watchers made blue movies,</i>

18:49.229 --> 18:53.064
<i>And I was their top seller.</i>

18:53.066 --> 18:55.566
<i>They said</i>
<i>I made men ejaculate gold.</i>

18:55.568 --> 18:57.702
<i>But this one was different.</i>

19:23.128 --> 19:25.129
<i>There was no costar.</i>

19:25.131 --> 19:27.765
<i>Usually there was</i>
<i>a boy or girl,</i>

19:27.767 --> 19:30.101
<i>A streetwalker or runaway.</i>

19:30.103 --> 19:33.271
<i>But there was just me.</i>

19:33.273 --> 19:35.840
<i>And I'd been drugged.</i>

19:38.510 --> 19:42.146
<i>Enough to be powerless</i>
<i>but not enough to forget.</i>

19:42.148 --> 19:44.115
<i>Not enough to not understand.</i>

19:44.117 --> 19:47.251
<i>Not enough to dull the pain.</i>

19:53.325 --> 19:55.760
(whirring)

20:04.970 --> 20:07.538
(shouting)
(saw buzzing)

20:13.979 --> 20:17.582
Snuff films, they call them.

20:24.156 --> 20:27.158
They told me

20:27.160 --> 20:30.528
I was one of the lucky ones.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.530
They just...

20:32.532 --> 20:34.465
Left me there to die.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.868
Who saved you?

20:37.870 --> 20:40.504
(shuddering breath)
the soldier boy.

20:40.506 --> 20:44.242
He had fallen in love
with his whore.

20:44.244 --> 20:47.245
He followed me everywhere.

20:47.247 --> 20:48.746
(sniffles)

20:48.748 --> 20:51.415
He rushed in
the minute they left.

20:54.353 --> 20:56.587
I will never forgive him for it.

20:57.856 --> 20:59.890
They passed
the film around

20:59.892 --> 21:03.261
Berlin, munich.

21:03.263 --> 21:07.298
I hear a copy
even made it to vienna.

21:09.234 --> 21:12.303
I was a star.

21:16.241 --> 21:18.876
But my career was over.

21:18.878 --> 21:21.946
It was all over for me.

21:28.387 --> 21:30.888
I had the most...

21:30.890 --> 21:33.324
Beautiful legs.

21:36.795 --> 21:39.230
Demon face:
She is the one.

21:39.232 --> 21:40.564
Yes.

21:40.566 --> 21:42.266
I am the one.

21:42.268 --> 21:44.068
Take me, please.

21:44.070 --> 21:47.305
I know now.
I can't deny it.

21:47.307 --> 21:48.639
Please.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.274
There is nothing left for me.

21:50.276 --> 21:51.876
It's all over.

21:52.411 --> 21:54.245
Are you ready?
Yes!

21:54.247 --> 21:56.814
Yes, yes, I am ready.

21:56.816 --> 21:59.617
I am ready.
Take me.

21:59.619 --> 22:02.920
Please. Take me.

22:02.922 --> 22:06.490
Take me!
What are you waiting for?!

22:06.492 --> 22:09.360
Please! Go on. Please take me!

22:10.829 --> 22:12.330
(gasps)

22:12.332 --> 22:15.132
(toy piano playing)

22:15.134 --> 22:18.202
Do you hear music?

22:21.273 --> 22:23.774
Dandy:
Ladies...

22:23.776 --> 22:26.110
And gentlemen!

22:26.112 --> 22:29.980
Creatures of all kinds!

22:29.982 --> 22:32.950
Children of all ages!

22:32.952 --> 22:36.320
You nasty little brats.

22:36.322 --> 22:37.988
Welcome to the greatest

22:37.990 --> 22:40.291
Show on...

22:40.293 --> 22:42.360
Earth!

22:42.362 --> 22:46.130
Meet my lovely assistant...

22:46.132 --> 22:47.365
Tiny tits.
(muffled screaming)

22:47.367 --> 22:49.467
And...

22:49.469 --> 22:53.170
My accompanist...
The amazing mr. Clown!

22:53.172 --> 22:54.438
(squealing)

22:56.208 --> 22:58.309
I've always wondered

22:58.311 --> 23:00.144
How this trick was done.

23:00.146 --> 23:01.312
Haven't you?

23:01.314 --> 23:02.480
Well...

23:02.482 --> 23:05.149
Let's find out.

23:05.151 --> 23:07.251
Shall we?
(muffled screaming)

23:12.224 --> 23:13.324
No!

23:13.326 --> 23:15.393
(laughing)
(screaming)

23:30.375 --> 23:32.643
(muffled laughing)

23:40.185 --> 23:42.453
Everybody run! Run!

23:45.357 --> 23:46.357
Wait!

23:46.359 --> 23:48.392
We're not finished!

23:48.394 --> 23:50.461
(both grunting)

24:14.052 --> 24:16.053
Don't stop now.

24:16.055 --> 24:17.455
We came for a show.

24:31.736 --> 24:33.437
Get back here!

24:33.439 --> 24:35.072
I haven't finished my show!

24:35.074 --> 24:37.441
Oh, he's close.

24:37.443 --> 24:39.443
Which way is the road?

24:39.445 --> 24:41.278
Just everyone stop, okay?

24:41.280 --> 24:43.414
Quiet.

24:43.416 --> 24:44.782
The road's that way.

24:44.784 --> 24:46.484
Take them and call
the police, okay?

24:46.486 --> 24:48.752
Go!
Come on! Come on!

24:48.754 --> 24:51.489
Dandy:
It's all trick and no treat
from here on out!

24:51.491 --> 24:54.158
Catch me if you can, asshole!

24:58.096 --> 24:59.330
(growls)

25:07.639 --> 25:10.508
You ruined my Halloween!

25:11.443 --> 25:13.444
You stupid girl!

25:13.446 --> 25:16.480
I hate you,
I hate you, I hate you,

25:16.482 --> 25:18.616
I hate you, I hate you!

25:18.618 --> 25:21.452
If I have to ask
you a second time,

25:21.454 --> 25:24.455
I fear it will
be less polite.

25:24.457 --> 25:26.724
Remove your mask.

25:41.640 --> 25:44.208
(groaning)

25:45.143 --> 25:46.544
Tell me your story.

25:46.546 --> 25:48.145
(moans)

25:48.147 --> 25:51.549
Calm yourself.

25:51.551 --> 25:54.652
Focus your mind, and
I will understand you.

25:54.654 --> 25:57.054
Begin at the beginning.

25:58.890 --> 26:02.526
It was 1943.

26:02.528 --> 26:05.162
Ah, the world in flames.

26:05.164 --> 26:08.699
People were in need of
clowns and laughter.

26:08.701 --> 26:10.734
(children laughing)

26:10.736 --> 26:14.171
Twisted clown:
<i>I was the special</i>
<i>children's clown</i>

26:14.173 --> 26:17.942
<i>To rusty westchester's</i>
<i>traveling carnival.</i>

26:19.578 --> 26:22.980
<i>I made 'em laugh.</i>

26:24.683 --> 26:27.518
<i>I love the children.</i>

26:27.520 --> 26:29.520
<i>But not the freaks.</i>

26:29.522 --> 26:32.389
<i>They're mean.</i>

26:32.391 --> 26:34.091
Man:
Yeah, I like it
when they sit

26:34.093 --> 26:36.026
On your lap and they
do that wiggle thing.

26:36.028 --> 26:37.227
Yeah.
(chuckles)

26:37.229 --> 26:38.929
How'd he get
that job, anyway?

26:38.931 --> 26:40.898
Yeah, I mean,
we got the seniority.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.366
Yeah.

26:42.368 --> 26:43.934
Well, we ought to
take care of that.

26:43.936 --> 26:45.402
Aye. Aye.
Yeah.

26:45.404 --> 26:47.538
Let's go.

26:47.540 --> 26:49.540
I feel good.

26:49.542 --> 26:52.509
(whispers):
Hey.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.613
Hey, simpleton.
Yeah, you.

26:55.615 --> 26:57.381
Come here,
come here.

26:57.383 --> 26:58.415
Yeah, come on,
come on.

26:58.417 --> 27:00.050
Yeah, come here,
come here.

27:00.052 --> 27:01.185
Here. Have a smoke.

27:03.421 --> 27:05.389
Have a seat.

27:05.391 --> 27:07.458
Sit down,
right here.

27:09.394 --> 27:10.594
Yeah.

27:10.596 --> 27:12.930
(coughs)

27:12.932 --> 27:14.565
(laughs)

27:14.567 --> 27:17.067
It... Burns my throat.

27:17.069 --> 27:18.902
(high-pitched):
"it burns my throat."

27:18.904 --> 27:20.904
How come you
talk so stupid?

27:20.906 --> 27:22.473
Your mama drop you
on your head?

27:22.475 --> 27:24.074
How'd you know that?

27:24.076 --> 27:26.410
Uh, it wasn't her fault.

27:26.412 --> 27:27.578
Too many cocktails.

27:27.580 --> 27:30.314
(all cackling)

27:34.986 --> 27:37.454
It wa... It wasn't so funny.

27:37.456 --> 27:40.090
Oh, it's funny all right. Hey.

27:40.092 --> 27:42.826
I hear you
like to do funny things

27:42.828 --> 27:44.995
With the little
kiddies.
Oh...

27:44.997 --> 27:47.765
I heard you like
to take advantage...
Oh...

27:47.767 --> 27:49.433
...'cause they think
you're a simpleton.

27:49.435 --> 27:53.003
(chuckles)
no. I love the kids.

27:53.005 --> 27:56.106
No, that's not what they say.

27:56.108 --> 27:59.009
(cackling)
aw, I didn't do nothing bad.

27:59.811 --> 28:01.545
Wait.

28:03.815 --> 28:06.684
What did I do?
W-what'd they say, anyway?

28:06.686 --> 28:08.686
Cops are coming soon.
Oh.

28:08.688 --> 28:10.821
They're gonna put you in jail.

28:10.823 --> 28:13.791
(laughter)

28:13.793 --> 28:16.193
Jail's for bad people.

28:16.195 --> 28:18.629
I'm a good person. Mama said so.

28:18.631 --> 28:21.031
Do you hear that?
I think the cops are coming.

28:21.033 --> 28:22.866
Uh-oh, you better
scram, simpleton,

28:22.868 --> 28:26.136
(chortles)
you better run
extra fast.

28:26.138 --> 28:28.005
Run, run!
Boo!

28:28.007 --> 28:29.940
(laughter)

28:33.645 --> 28:35.713
(whimpering)

28:37.716 --> 28:39.349
Never cared for dwarves.

28:39.351 --> 28:40.818
Power mad, the lot of them.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.886
So they drove
you out.

28:42.888 --> 28:45.723
Word... Travels around

28:45.725 --> 28:48.826
In the carny circuit.

28:48.828 --> 28:50.561
I couldn't...

28:50.563 --> 28:53.664
Be a clown anymore.

28:53.666 --> 28:57.901
<i>So I came home to jupiter.</i>

28:59.337 --> 29:01.905
<i>But mama had died.</i>

29:04.676 --> 29:07.811
<i>I had a idea.</i>

29:14.352 --> 29:16.687
<i>I would turn the garbage</i>

29:16.689 --> 29:18.989
<i>Into gold.</i>
<i>(chuckles)</i>

29:21.726 --> 29:25.796
<i>Like rumpelstiltskin.</i>

29:28.399 --> 29:29.733
Uh, how about spouty?

29:29.735 --> 29:30.701
No.

29:30.703 --> 29:33.704
This one...

29:33.706 --> 29:34.872
Kids ain't gonna go for these.

29:34.874 --> 29:36.273
Oh, you're wrong.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.876
This will be a big
hit with the kids.

29:38.878 --> 29:40.878
I said no.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.880
(tinkling)

29:42.882 --> 29:43.981
Look at that one!

29:45.750 --> 29:46.917
Hey, boy.

29:46.919 --> 29:48.385
Don't you want this?

29:48.387 --> 29:50.721
Huh? Isn't this
your favorite toy?

29:50.723 --> 29:53.090
He doesn't want
your filthy whirligig.

29:53.092 --> 29:54.792
Kids love me.

29:54.794 --> 29:57.561
I know better than anybody
else what kids want.

29:57.563 --> 29:58.962
Hey, hey, keep your distance.

29:58.964 --> 30:00.297
You're one of those
twisted types

30:00.299 --> 30:02.366
That-that does
stuff to kids.

30:09.574 --> 30:11.742
That's a lie.

30:11.744 --> 30:14.244
That's a lie.

30:14.246 --> 30:16.747
That's a bad,

30:16.749 --> 30:19.650
Bad lie.

30:19.652 --> 30:21.685
(grunting)

30:23.822 --> 30:25.989
I'm a good person.

30:25.991 --> 30:27.591
Hey.

30:27.593 --> 30:28.926
You better get out of here

30:28.928 --> 30:30.060
Or I'm gonna call the police.

30:51.783 --> 30:55.152
Twisted clown:
<i>I thought...</i>

30:55.154 --> 30:58.488
<i>"I'm so dumb...</i>

30:58.490 --> 31:00.691
(gunshot)

31:00.693 --> 31:04.361
<i>...I can't even kill myself."</i>

31:04.363 --> 31:06.997
(muffled whimper)

31:06.999 --> 31:09.967
<i>But then...</i>

31:09.969 --> 31:13.237
<i>Then I had one good idea.</i>

31:19.644 --> 31:21.712
(muffled grunting)

31:26.818 --> 31:28.986
Jimmy:
<i>That's right, folks,</i>
<i>everyone's having fun.</i>

31:28.988 --> 31:30.854
Come right up, come right up.
Human oddities--

31:30.856 --> 31:32.656
The greatest on earth.

31:32.658 --> 31:35.993
They'll curl your hair
and scare your bloomers off.

31:35.995 --> 31:39.029
Â¶ gimme,
come on down Â¶

31:39.031 --> 31:41.031
Â¶ it's a parade.

31:41.033 --> 31:43.867
Don't mind him, folks.
He's just a little bit kooky.

31:43.869 --> 31:45.903
You want a balloon, you're
gonna have to pay me.

31:45.905 --> 31:47.905
That's all right, we
love everyone here.

31:47.907 --> 31:49.339
Come on down,
come on down,

31:49.341 --> 31:51.008
Poor creature.
Get on in there. Have fun...

31:51.010 --> 31:53.744
Edward:
<i>It's a sad tale, isn't it?</i>

31:53.746 --> 31:55.612
A pitiful one.

31:58.016 --> 32:00.350
So noble.

32:00.352 --> 32:03.086
So misunderstood.

32:03.088 --> 32:05.155
Tell me about
the children.

32:07.859 --> 32:10.027
I saved 'em.

32:10.029 --> 32:13.697
From what did you
save them, I wonder?

32:13.699 --> 32:15.532
From the freaks!

32:15.534 --> 32:18.001
The evil, mean freaks!

32:20.571 --> 32:22.272
<i>The children forgot</i>

32:22.274 --> 32:25.943
<i>That they loved me.</i>

32:25.945 --> 32:27.711
<i>The freaks were stealing 'em,</i>

32:27.713 --> 32:29.379
<i>Just like before.</i>

32:29.381 --> 32:31.248
(muffled moaning)

32:31.250 --> 32:32.883
<i>I knew what I had to do.</i>

32:32.885 --> 32:35.218
(shouting)

32:35.220 --> 32:37.554
(screaming)

32:37.556 --> 32:41.091
<i>I had to get 'em back.</i>

32:41.093 --> 32:43.961
(screaming)
<i>I made a funny show for 'em.</i>

32:45.596 --> 32:47.564
<i>Their parents were mean.</i>

32:47.566 --> 32:49.266
<i>I gave 'em candy.</i>

32:49.268 --> 32:51.268
<i>I didn't make 'em</i>
<i>do any chores.</i>

32:51.270 --> 32:54.071
(screaming)
no, no!

32:54.073 --> 32:57.107
Twisted clown:
<i>I got a pretty babysitter</i>
<i>for 'em.</i>

32:57.109 --> 32:58.742
(gasps, grunts)

32:58.744 --> 33:00.043
No!

33:01.779 --> 33:04.748
I'm a good clown.

33:04.750 --> 33:06.817
(indistinct whispering)

33:22.433 --> 33:26.303
I have met many a craven killer,

33:26.305 --> 33:28.839
Many a sniveling coward
in my time,

33:28.841 --> 33:31.274
But every one of them
could admit the blackness

33:31.276 --> 33:33.043
In their own hearts
when the hour came.

33:34.946 --> 33:38.015
You...

33:38.017 --> 33:41.852
Have caused the demon...
To weep.

33:43.788 --> 33:45.789
I don't understand.

33:45.791 --> 33:46.857
Stand up, clown.

33:55.166 --> 33:56.533
Demon face:
You are the one.

33:58.970 --> 34:00.370
(grunting)

34:29.867 --> 34:31.935
Â¶

34:43.014 --> 34:44.848
Come, brother.

34:44.850 --> 34:46.149
Join us.

35:10.908 --> 35:12.976
Â¶

35:25.123 --> 35:27.190
(gasps)

35:32.130 --> 35:35.098
You can run, but you can't hide.

35:35.100 --> 35:37.167
Not for long.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.243
(sighs softly)

36:34.959 --> 36:37.027
(sirens approaching)

36:44.335 --> 36:46.403
(sobs softly)

37:12.029 --> 37:13.830
So you never saw his face,

37:13.832 --> 37:16.032
This man who was
going to cut you in half?

37:16.034 --> 37:17.867
He wore a mask the whole time,

37:17.869 --> 37:21.338
And I was in that box, so I
couldn't really get a good look.

37:21.340 --> 37:23.673
But they were both
dressed like clowns?

37:23.675 --> 37:25.742
(door closes)

37:32.350 --> 37:34.417
Did you hear anything?

37:36.687 --> 37:39.356
One talked, the other one
didn't say a word.

37:39.358 --> 37:41.358
Would you recognize his voice
if you heard it again?

37:41.360 --> 37:43.393
Sounded muffled
through the plastic.

37:43.395 --> 37:44.761
Yet other little kids

37:44.763 --> 37:47.197
Were able to see the man
with his mask off.

37:47.199 --> 37:49.699
They're in pretty bad shape,
but we'll get a description.

37:49.701 --> 37:51.601
All I know is
they were both crazy.

37:51.603 --> 37:53.203
Colquitt: <i>The clown</i>
<i>that was killed here--</i>

37:53.205 --> 37:55.238
Did you see what happened?

37:55.240 --> 37:58.908
Nobody would blame you
if you had to defend yourself.

37:58.910 --> 38:01.244
Killing a maniac like that
would be a public service.

38:01.246 --> 38:03.046
I didn't see anything.

38:03.048 --> 38:04.581
Foster:
<i>Important thing is</i>

38:04.583 --> 38:07.717
You brought these kids
back to their families alive.

38:07.719 --> 38:10.387
Way I see it,

38:10.389 --> 38:14.257
You're a hero, young lady.

38:14.259 --> 38:15.625
No.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.260
Jimmy's the real hero.

38:17.262 --> 38:18.795
Jimmy:
<i>I didn't do anything special.</i>

38:18.797 --> 38:21.264
I like you, kid.

38:21.266 --> 38:24.134
Humility is gonna
take you a long way.

38:24.136 --> 38:26.903
Detective, why don't you
write your name down

38:26.905 --> 38:29.239
So the reporters can spell it
when I talk to them.

38:29.241 --> 38:31.741
I'm gonna tell them
about the real hero.

38:31.743 --> 38:33.076
You pulling my leg?

38:33.078 --> 38:35.278
The real hero is the person

38:35.280 --> 38:37.080
Who got killed
at the police station

38:37.082 --> 38:38.948
After you arrested him.

38:38.950 --> 38:41.418
Meep didn't deserve to die.

38:41.420 --> 38:44.321
And somebody is going to pay
for what happened to my friend.

39:05.843 --> 39:07.911
Where the hell have you been?!

39:09.347 --> 39:11.614
Jimmy:
Curfew's lifted.

39:11.616 --> 39:13.350
What?

39:13.352 --> 39:14.517
Have they caught the killer?

39:14.519 --> 39:16.286
He did.

39:16.288 --> 39:17.320
Caught the killer.

39:17.322 --> 39:18.788
Saved the kids.

39:18.790 --> 39:20.857
Saved everybody.

39:20.859 --> 39:22.292
I got to pee.

39:22.294 --> 39:25.195
You try holding it on
a bike for five miles.

39:34.805 --> 39:37.340
That girl has cast a spell.

39:37.342 --> 39:39.642
She's not the only one.

39:39.644 --> 39:41.511
The camp had a visitor
last night.

39:41.513 --> 39:43.813
Edward mordrake.

39:43.815 --> 39:46.316
He came to you, too?

39:46.318 --> 39:47.884
Not to me,
but he claimed his freak.

39:56.327 --> 39:58.094
<i>Was es loss?</i>

39:59.497 --> 40:01.331
They've finally come

40:01.333 --> 40:03.299
To run us out.

40:15.379 --> 40:16.913
You jimmy?

40:16.915 --> 40:18.481
What do you and the rest
of this mob want?

40:19.683 --> 40:21.418
We wanted to thank you.

40:23.020 --> 40:24.354
You saved our son.

40:24.356 --> 40:26.055
You saved our town.

40:26.057 --> 40:27.824
I want to shake
your hand.

40:39.603 --> 40:42.372
Jane:
Jessie?

40:42.374 --> 40:43.573
Homemade brownies.
I only had one.

40:43.575 --> 40:45.775
Thank you.

40:49.747 --> 40:51.881
Are you a real lady?

40:51.883 --> 40:53.883
Jessie! Manners!

40:53.885 --> 40:55.385
Oh, that's okay, darling.

40:55.387 --> 40:57.220
I'm a lady.

40:57.222 --> 40:58.488
And then some.

41:00.057 --> 41:02.826
(crowd chattering)

41:19.910 --> 41:21.978
Â¶

41:33.457 --> 41:34.591
Ladies and gentlemen!

41:34.593 --> 41:35.792
One and all.

41:35.794 --> 41:37.093
We would like to

41:37.095 --> 41:38.495
Invite you

41:38.497 --> 41:42.098
To our grand
command performance tonight.

41:42.100 --> 41:45.001
Here in our big top.

41:45.003 --> 41:47.504
Tickets are available
over there

41:47.506 --> 41:49.506
At the box office.

41:49.508 --> 41:52.408
(applause)

42:08.459 --> 42:10.460
Elsa:
<i>Space them closer together.</i>

42:10.462 --> 42:13.963
You wanted to see us?

42:13.965 --> 42:16.032
Yes.

42:16.034 --> 42:18.501
We have a sold-out show tonight,

42:18.503 --> 42:21.337
And I've made some changes
to the set list.

42:21.339 --> 42:23.306
No, I get it.

42:23.308 --> 42:25.975
Now that there's a full house,
we're warming up for you.

42:25.977 --> 42:27.477
Don't be silly.

42:27.479 --> 42:29.512
You're warming up
for the pinheads.

42:29.514 --> 42:30.980
You can't be serious.

42:30.982 --> 42:33.049
But it's our faces
on the banner.

42:33.051 --> 42:34.717
But that was last week,
<i>liebchen.</i>

42:35.486 --> 42:36.719
We took that banner down.

42:36.721 --> 42:38.555
Uh, knock, knock?

42:38.557 --> 42:40.890
(chuckles):
Uh, sorry...

42:40.892 --> 42:43.526
To bother you folks--
I, uh... I was hoping

42:43.528 --> 42:45.562
To buy a ticket to the show,

42:45.564 --> 42:47.730
But it seems
to be sold out.

42:47.732 --> 42:49.399
I'm here from, uh,

42:49.401 --> 42:51.367
Out of town.

42:51.369 --> 42:53.336
Yeah, hollywood,

42:53.338 --> 42:55.705
California, is
where I call home.

42:55.707 --> 42:57.574
Hollywood?

42:58.509 --> 43:00.510
Richard spencer.

43:00.512 --> 43:02.879
Talent scout.

43:02.881 --> 43:05.381
I think we can find you a seat.

43:05.383 --> 43:07.417
Ah...
(laughs softly)

43:11.589 --> 43:14.090
Oh, for the love
of christopher!

43:15.693 --> 43:17.026
Really?
Is that what you tore up

43:17.028 --> 43:18.595
All those fine things to make?

43:18.597 --> 43:21.197
Don't let your mother
see you like that.

43:21.199 --> 43:22.699
She's been running
around all day

43:22.701 --> 43:24.534
Trying to find you
the proper costume--

43:24.536 --> 43:26.035
Not that you would
appreciate it.

43:26.037 --> 43:27.704
So go change,
and take this tray

43:27.706 --> 43:29.205
To your mother.

43:29.207 --> 43:31.574
She's feeling a weakness
from running around.

43:31.576 --> 43:33.710
Halloween is over.

43:33.712 --> 43:35.612
Get bent and
take this tray.

43:38.916 --> 43:41.584
Enough of this!
I'm not afraid of you.

43:41.586 --> 43:43.553
You little made-in-
the-shade white boy.

43:43.555 --> 43:45.555
You can barely wash
your own ass.

43:45.557 --> 43:47.256
I know, 'cause I wash

43:47.258 --> 43:48.791
Your shitty drawers.
(chuckles)

43:48.793 --> 43:51.394
I'll take it myself. Move!

43:51.396 --> 43:52.629
(yells)

43:53.964 --> 43:56.032
Â¶

44:20.958 --> 44:23.660
(low chuckling)

44:26.764 --> 44:29.565
(laughing)
