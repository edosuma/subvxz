[chuckles] Do it again, Elvis.

What? Frankie, wake up!

01:13.198 --> 01:14.115
[Grace groans]

01:15.408 --> 01:17.786
-I was dreaming.
-I heard.

01:17.869 --> 01:19.329
-[groans]
-How's Elvis?

01:19.412 --> 01:24.084
[groans] Oh. Chatty, down-to-earth...
as in life.

01:26.336 --> 01:27.587
Still no juice?

01:27.670 --> 01:28.671
No.

01:28.755 --> 01:32.592
Your numerous calls to the power company
pretending to be a past winner

01:32.675 --> 01:35.428
of the Mrs. Power Company Pageant
seem to have failed.

01:36.054 --> 01:37.806
I have another idea.

01:37.889 --> 01:39.349
[both moan]

01:39.432 --> 01:41.101
Yeah, I'm right there with you, sister.

01:41.893 --> 01:44.104
We got to get our stuff
from Walden Villas.

01:44.187 --> 01:46.815
I need my pills. I need my toothbrush.

01:46.898 --> 01:49.359
I need my pills
and your toothbrush, too.

01:49.442 --> 01:51.277
-But we can't leave.
-Why not?

01:51.361 --> 01:54.864
We're squatting. That means
we have to stay put and squat.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.826
Well, I'll go,
and you can squat your brains out.

01:57.909 --> 02:01.496
Oh, no way, lady.
Bad things happen when we split up.

02:01.579 --> 02:03.623
That's how this whole mess started.

02:04.541 --> 02:07.877
Also how the grill ended up
at the bottom of the pool last year.

02:07.961 --> 02:11.005
Oh, I thought it "jumped"
because "it looked depressed."

02:11.589 --> 02:14.134
Man, I say some crazy stuff.

02:16.052 --> 02:18.012
Hello. My eyes are up here.

02:18.096 --> 02:20.557
I'm trying to find somebody to call
to bring us our stuff

02:20.640 --> 02:22.517
and my battery's down to three percent,

02:22.600 --> 02:24.102
so whoever it is,
they better come through.

02:24.602 --> 02:26.104
Then let's call Elizabeth Warren.

02:26.187 --> 02:30.066
She's the only person
not letting me down these days.

02:35.155 --> 02:38.783
No, we've had fights before,
but never like this.

02:39.325 --> 02:40.160
He hit me.

02:41.411 --> 02:42.829
In my elbow.

02:43.872 --> 02:46.833
I'm not sure what he was aiming for,
my stomach?

02:46.916 --> 02:49.794
I never thought of Jeff
as someone who got that mad.

02:49.878 --> 02:50.920
Oh, he is.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.298
He put his fist through a window...

02:54.465 --> 02:57.343
on a gingerbread house
for a party we're catering.

02:57.594 --> 02:58.595
No, wait.

02:59.929 --> 03:01.681
We made that for ourselves.

03:01.764 --> 03:04.309
But I thought you and Jeff
had an open relationship,

03:04.392 --> 03:07.312
with the "go-aheading"
and all those rules.

03:07.395 --> 03:09.314
We do, but...

03:10.481 --> 03:12.192
[exhales]

03:12.275 --> 03:14.527
I may have broken a few rules.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.988
-A few?
-Okay, fine, all of them.

03:17.071 --> 03:19.949
I slept with Stevie Mazza
in our bed more than once.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.618
Who is Stevie Mazza?

03:21.701 --> 03:24.287
He who shall not be played with.

03:24.370 --> 03:26.414
Oh... a temptress.

03:26.497 --> 03:31.419
I also watched the new season
of American Horror Story without Jeff.

03:31.502 --> 03:32.670
That's not so bad.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.255
With Stevie Mazza...

03:34.339 --> 03:36.758
in our bed... more than once.

03:36.925 --> 03:39.093
Perhaps it's time to say goodbye
to Stevie Mazza.

03:39.552 --> 03:42.972
When we say goodbye
is usually when we...

03:43.389 --> 03:44.599
"say hello" again.

03:44.682 --> 03:46.309
-Oh, my God.
-Come on.

03:46.392 --> 03:48.686
You and Jeff
have been together 15 years.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.313
You can't just throw that away.

03:50.396 --> 03:51.856
He threw me out!

03:51.940 --> 03:53.066
So climb back in.

03:53.149 --> 03:55.276
Our condo is on the 14th floor.

03:55.360 --> 03:59.072
The stairs to forgiveness are built
with honesty and penitence.

04:00.406 --> 04:03.451
Those nuns really did a number on you.

04:04.285 --> 04:05.495
[cell phone buzzing]

04:06.955 --> 04:07.789
It's Grace.

04:08.623 --> 04:11.751
-Boop. Straight to voicemail.
-I can't.

04:14.003 --> 04:15.838
Well, if it isn't El Chapo!

04:15.922 --> 04:17.215
[chuckles]

04:18.424 --> 04:21.094
You know, because you escaped.

04:23.721 --> 04:26.599
I don't know why I said that either.
Let's just forget it.

04:27.350 --> 04:28.476
Uh-huh.

04:29.811 --> 04:32.313
-Well, what do you need exactly?
-Oh.

04:36.818 --> 04:37.819
[Frankie] Ready?

04:38.778 --> 04:39.862
Ready.

04:42.031 --> 04:42.907
[Frankie grunts]

04:42.991 --> 04:43.825
Good.

04:55.086 --> 04:58.047
-Ah. And then there was light.
-Oh, God.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.007
[Frankie] Ooh.

04:59.090 --> 05:00.883
And when is there "couch"?

05:01.384 --> 05:05.388
Squatting is not meant to be comfortable,
hence the name.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.724
We just need the bare essentials.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.559
Knock, knock.

05:09.642 --> 05:10.643
[Frankie] Oh.

05:11.477 --> 05:14.022
Where are our bare essentials?

05:14.605 --> 05:17.984
Katie at Walden Villas would not
release any of your property to us

05:18.067 --> 05:19.652
without a handwritten note.

05:19.736 --> 05:23.197
She also gave us this invoice
for the golf cart you wrecked.

05:23.281 --> 05:27.035
What part of "sneak in and bring us
our stuff" did you not understand?

05:27.118 --> 05:28.911
They have guards there.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.080
Sol got spooked by the geese.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.623
They really come at you.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.500
Oh, Jesus Christ, Sol.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.502
You and geese. Give me that!

05:39.297 --> 05:40.923
I can see that you're squatting,

05:41.716 --> 05:44.093
and although I admire your commitment--

05:44.177 --> 05:46.220
It's illegal and dangerous.

05:46.304 --> 05:49.098
Those are my two wheelhouses, buddy.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.767
We defended you to the kids,

05:50.850 --> 05:53.770
but now you're just confirming
their worst fears.

05:53.853 --> 05:56.731
You "defended us," how grand of you!

05:56.814 --> 05:59.734
Where were you
when they locked us into that prison?

05:59.817 --> 06:02.653
Walden Villas has
a 24-hour frozen yogurt bar.

06:02.737 --> 06:05.907
Without a toppings trolley,
it is a prison, Robert.

06:05.990 --> 06:08.618
Yeah, and we could've used
some backup before we lost this place.

06:08.701 --> 06:10.495
You agreed to move!

06:10.578 --> 06:12.622
Because the kids
ran their little scheme on us.

06:12.705 --> 06:15.458
Yeah, yeah. Watch out, Robert,
they're coming for you next.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.960
I mean, your heart
is basically a cheeseburger.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.630
-I don't think that's very--
-And your whole thing is off!

06:21.339 --> 06:23.049
I told you not to answer the phone.

06:23.132 --> 06:25.676
I heard that! What did he say?

06:25.760 --> 06:27.720
-[Robert] We should go.
-No!

06:28.388 --> 06:30.640
What if it were you and your house?

06:30.723 --> 06:34.102
Would you wanna leave just
because you had a few minor setbacks?

06:34.185 --> 06:35.812
But our house is more manageable.

06:35.895 --> 06:39.524
It's only one floor. That's one
of the reasons we decided to move there.

06:39.607 --> 06:41.025
But that's it right there.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.820
You decided to move.
You weren't railroaded into it.

06:44.070 --> 06:44.946
[sighs]

06:45.029 --> 06:48.074
What if the roles were reversed?
We'd be there for you.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.243
Be here for us.

06:57.375 --> 06:58.626
Write Katie a note.

06:58.709 --> 07:00.795
We'll figure out a way
around the golf cart.

07:00.878 --> 07:03.423
-Hey, here.
-Thank you.

07:03.965 --> 07:05.842
But please, don't tell the kids.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.427
Oh, don't worry. [chuckles]

07:07.510 --> 07:10.096
We're never talking to
those clowns again, huh.

07:13.599 --> 07:15.101
[sighs]

07:15.184 --> 07:17.145
All right, who's going first?

07:17.228 --> 07:18.771
Not me, please.

07:18.855 --> 07:20.648
I still kind of have PTSD.

07:22.358 --> 07:25.528
This is how we decided who was gonna
tell Mom that Paul Newman died.

07:25.611 --> 07:28.489
-She hit you hard.
-Not as hard as she's gonna hit the person

07:28.573 --> 07:30.408
that tells her she's
to return to Walden Villas.

07:30.491 --> 07:31.909
Well, if you're afraid of straws,

07:31.993 --> 07:34.579
we could do the thing
where whoever just moved back from LA

07:34.662 --> 07:38.583
because their relationship failed
does it because they have no job.

07:38.666 --> 07:41.043
Or we could do the straw thing.

07:42.253 --> 07:44.630
Fine. But if I lose
and have to be the bad guy again,

07:44.714 --> 07:46.382
Mom might put me back up for adoption.

07:46.841 --> 07:49.260
-Oh, we can do that?
-I'm ready. Wait. No, wait.

07:50.928 --> 07:53.264
[blows air]
Okay, now I'm ready.

07:53.347 --> 07:54.682
I will go first.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.563
-[Coyote laughs]
-[Bud] Oh!

08:01.147 --> 08:02.440
-You lose.
-[exhales]

08:02.523 --> 08:05.109
And now we all know how to play.
So, let's begin.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.111
Cheater.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.576
[Coyote chuckles]

08:13.659 --> 08:15.369
-[Coyote] Yes.
-And this one is for you, Bud.

08:15.453 --> 08:17.622
And now, I will pick one for Coyote.

08:17.705 --> 08:19.457
Um. No, you won't.

08:25.046 --> 08:27.173
If I'm being honest, Grace,

08:28.090 --> 08:30.092
I like it better this way.

08:31.385 --> 08:33.804
I could tell you not to get used to it,
but then you'd say,

08:33.888 --> 08:37.683
"Too late, Grace. I've already given you
a hobo nickname. It's Patches."

08:38.142 --> 08:41.229
-Hey... I'm Patches!
-[chuckles]

08:41.312 --> 08:43.606
-[door closes]
-Hi.

08:43.689 --> 08:45.441
Bye.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.487
Why is all your stuff back here?

08:49.570 --> 08:53.115
Your dad and the other one
went and got it for us.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.159
They're on our side now.

08:55.243 --> 08:58.246
Well, you know who else is on your side?
This gal.

08:58.329 --> 09:02.333
That's why I'm here, to give you guys
a ride to Mallory's house. Let's go.

09:02.416 --> 09:04.418
We're not going to Mallory's.
Why would we do that?

09:04.710 --> 09:07.255
Uh, for Macklin's birthday party.

09:07.338 --> 09:09.882
Or did you forget
your eldest grandchild's birthday?

09:09.966 --> 09:12.385
No. I remember... him.

09:12.969 --> 09:16.806
Okay, up and at 'em.
Frankie, there's a bouncy house.

09:17.348 --> 09:18.558
Nice try, blondie.

09:18.641 --> 09:22.562
But everybody knows
that Macklin is afraid of bouncy houses

09:22.645 --> 09:25.189
and his birthday is August 14,

09:25.273 --> 09:29.819
the same as his and my favorite actor,
Marcia Gay Harden.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.572
Yeah. And I don't usually go
to those things anyway.

09:32.655 --> 09:35.908
You've grossly overestimated
my interest in my grandchildren.

09:35.992 --> 09:37.410
Okay, fine.

09:37.493 --> 09:39.161
And what is the plan here?

09:39.245 --> 09:42.748
'Cause whoever bought this house
is gonna have you dragged out of here.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.084
That is what we, as squatters, live for.

09:45.167 --> 09:47.712
And newsflash, I'm un-draggable.

09:48.879 --> 09:51.173
-Just try.
-Oh, Frankie!

09:52.216 --> 09:54.385
All right.
[clears throat]

09:54.927 --> 09:58.556
-[Bree] Oh!
-Wait. I'm not ready!

09:59.807 --> 10:03.352
-You're supposed to say "one, two, three."
-The cops will say "one, two, three"?

10:03.436 --> 10:05.813
That's who the new owner
is gonna call: the cops.

10:05.896 --> 10:08.357
Who exactly is this new owner?

10:08.649 --> 10:11.736
Why the secrecy and shadow corporations?

10:11.819 --> 10:14.447
I honestly don't know who it is.

10:14.530 --> 10:17.533
Well, I figured out
what was happening on Westworld.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.869
I can figure out who this new owner is.

10:19.952 --> 10:21.078
And do what?

10:21.162 --> 10:23.956
Oh, wouldn't you like to know.
And button your blouse.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.375
No. This is the style, Mom.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.294
They're all dead.

10:29.629 --> 10:30.796
What?

10:31.464 --> 10:33.132
On Westworld.

10:34.425 --> 10:37.428
Oh... my God.

10:46.604 --> 10:49.607
You agreeing
to help Grace and Frankie was lovely.

10:49.690 --> 10:53.444
-Thank you.
-You telling Katie from Walden Villas

10:53.527 --> 10:56.405
that we are gonna pay
for the golf cart, not so lovely.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.575
And you really do need to get
your geese thing under control.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.911
So I'm the problem,
not the man-eating geese?

11:01.994 --> 11:04.497
[Peter] Just take your arancini balls
and get out of here!

11:04.580 --> 11:07.041
Three dozen balls are not enough!

11:07.124 --> 11:08.834
Why did I make all this other food

11:08.918 --> 11:10.795
if they're just gonna eat
a big pile of balls?

11:10.878 --> 11:14.590
I don't know, I'm not the one
who slept with Stevie Mazza!

11:15.007 --> 11:17.051
Um... Hi, guys.

11:17.134 --> 11:20.638
Nice to see you, Jeff.
What... is going on here? [chuckles]

11:20.721 --> 11:23.224
Well, someone didn't tell me

11:23.307 --> 11:25.685
the Dovinskis moved
their dinner party to tonight, so...

11:25.768 --> 11:28.813
Someone told you in a text,
which I know you read,

11:28.896 --> 11:30.981
because it says "read."

11:31.065 --> 11:33.150
I asked you to turn that function off!

11:33.234 --> 11:35.945
Aha! But why is this happening here?

11:36.028 --> 11:38.781
Because Jeff keeps kicking me
out of the house.

11:38.864 --> 11:42.702
I think Jeff may fall on the right side
of history on this one.

11:42.785 --> 11:43.911
Put that down!

11:43.994 --> 11:45.788
None of this is for you!

11:47.331 --> 11:49.542
I'm sorry, Robert.
My husband seems to think

11:49.625 --> 11:51.419
since he's been acting like a dog,

11:51.502 --> 11:53.838
he can talk to other people
like they're our Great Dane.

11:53.921 --> 11:55.089
Wow.

11:55.172 --> 11:57.842
Joan Crawford called,
she wants her exit back!

11:57.925 --> 11:59.969
Call me "Joan Crawford" one more time--

12:00.052 --> 12:04.306
It's like I can see the shoulder pads
growing while you talk to me.

12:09.186 --> 12:11.647
[Jeff] You are the only one
who thinks this is funny!

12:11.731 --> 12:15.151
[Peter] I don't think this is funny.
I don't think any of this is funny.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.570
[muffled voices]

12:18.571 --> 12:23.325
I finally understand Grace's theory
that all people are terrible.

12:23.409 --> 12:26.787
And you know neither one of them
is going to wash a dish.

12:27.496 --> 12:29.331
We need to get our house back.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.543
Maybe we can get them back together.

12:32.626 --> 12:36.714
Yeah, then maybe we can get
the two Koreas to patch things up.

12:36.797 --> 12:39.341
Or maybe they'll work it out
on their own.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.426
[Jeff] Go to hell!

12:40.509 --> 12:42.094
[Peter] I'm already there!

12:44.597 --> 12:47.349
Or maybe we'll help them
work it out on their own.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.351
[dishes clatter]

12:50.186 --> 12:54.273
Yes, hi. This is Carol Carruthers
of Carol Carruthers Realty.

12:54.356 --> 13:00.738
Um... I'm trying to get info
on the sale of 40224 Seahaven Way.

13:00.821 --> 13:05.701
Hello, I'm the new owner
of 40224 Seahaven Way.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.329
Can you remind me what my name is?

13:08.412 --> 13:10.873
[scoffs] What do you mean
you haven't heard of me?

13:10.956 --> 13:13.375
Have you not seen my bus-bench ads?

13:13.501 --> 13:17.254
No, of course I know who I am.
How dare you!

13:17.338 --> 13:20.132
Who do you think I am? Say it!

13:20.216 --> 13:21.383
There's one downtown.

13:22.593 --> 13:24.386
There's one in La Mesa.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.347
All right, I'm gonna level with you.

13:26.430 --> 13:30.518
My name is Jennifer Nightingale
and I am a tax accountant.

13:30.601 --> 13:33.437
Hello? Go for Nightingale.

13:33.521 --> 13:34.688
[sighs]

13:35.773 --> 13:37.483
-Any luck?
-Nope. You?

13:37.566 --> 13:39.068
-Fingers crossed.
-[Grace sighs]

13:39.151 --> 13:42.905
Maybe I should call my friend, Shirl.
Her brother-in-law used to work--

13:42.988 --> 13:44.782
-[snorting]
-Wha-- What is that?

13:47.117 --> 13:49.870
[Grace] Oh! What the heck?!

13:49.954 --> 13:53.666
-Oh, my God! Dreams do come true!
-[Grace screams]

13:53.749 --> 13:55.751
-[Frankie laughing]
-Oh, my God.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.461
No! No!

13:57.545 --> 14:00.381
I did not order any of this.

14:00.464 --> 14:02.258
What the hell is going on?

14:02.341 --> 14:05.386
Well, apparently the trail
of Werther's Originals I left

14:05.469 --> 14:07.847
leading to the ocean did not work.

14:07.930 --> 14:12.059
Well, we're squatting and we brought
our own Werther's Originals.

14:12.142 --> 14:14.979
If you think a couple of pigs
are gonna scare us off--

14:15.062 --> 14:18.315
You'd be absolutely right!
Get them away from me.

14:18.399 --> 14:20.693
You'd be wrong, bring us more!

14:20.776 --> 14:24.905
Why do you have an overnight bag?
Are you squatting on our squat?

14:24.989 --> 14:28.367
I'm not squatting on your squat
cause there's no squat to squat on.

14:28.450 --> 14:31.704
I'm pig-sitting
for a rich gluten-free baby...

14:31.787 --> 14:34.039
who arrives tomorrow.

14:34.123 --> 14:36.625
Well, the pigs are welcome,
but their owner is not.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.502
Also, the pigs are not welcome.

14:38.586 --> 14:41.964
Listen to me, you old corn-husk dolls.

14:42.464 --> 14:46.051
I just drove from Los Angeles
with two pigs in my car.

14:46.135 --> 14:49.722
I stopped for gas and had to chase
one of them around an Arco Mini Mart

14:49.805 --> 14:53.642
in front of a middle-aged surfer
eating a Slim Jim.

14:53.726 --> 14:56.937
So, unless you wanna get eaten
by them two pigs, honey--

14:57.021 --> 14:58.188
Is that a threat?

14:58.272 --> 15:03.652
Because what you might not know is that
this ordinary phone contains a camera.

15:03.736 --> 15:06.822
Yeah. She doesn't know
how to use it, but I do.

15:06.906 --> 15:10.701
[chuckles] I made it to the finals
of America's Got Talent.

15:10.784 --> 15:11.994
How is this my life?

15:12.703 --> 15:15.456
Oh! You're that Benjamin Le Day!

15:15.539 --> 15:19.251
Oh, Grace, Grace quick,
get us two dozen plates!

15:19.335 --> 15:20.669
Dinner plates.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.087
Oh, he's leaving!

15:24.840 --> 15:27.301
No, go away! Go away. Go away.

15:28.052 --> 15:32.181
-We don't need that old mean Benjamin.
-Go away!

15:32.640 --> 15:35.142
Do we, Sasha?

15:35.225 --> 15:37.853
I'm glad he had an epic meltdown,

15:38.354 --> 15:40.856
but sad he didn't do the plate thing.

15:41.857 --> 15:43.859
I hate how much you're loving all this.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.320
I hate how much you're hating it.

15:46.403 --> 15:48.280
Pigs are wonderful.

15:48.364 --> 15:49.865
They're just great.

15:50.282 --> 15:52.952
-[inhales, screams]
-[pigs snorting]

15:53.035 --> 15:55.746
Oh, my God. I can't-- I can't do this!

15:55.829 --> 15:57.539
But we're so close!

15:57.623 --> 15:59.792
To what? Being impregnated by a pig?

16:00.751 --> 16:02.127
Come on, Jazz.

16:02.211 --> 16:03.128
Ow!

16:03.212 --> 16:04.546
Come on, over here.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.757
Come on. Get into your little pen.

16:07.466 --> 16:10.010
There. Now you can sleep.

16:10.260 --> 16:13.681
Huh. Yeah, I can barely sleep
even when I have a bed.

16:13.764 --> 16:16.308
Oh, this is totally normal, Grace.

16:16.392 --> 16:17.977
First squat jitters.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.521
The adrenalin of day one has faded,

16:20.604 --> 16:23.190
and the fire of day ten
has not yet been ignited.

16:23.273 --> 16:24.650
Day ten?

16:25.359 --> 16:28.696
[scoffs] What exactly is all this
supposed to accomplish?

16:28.779 --> 16:31.240
We're gonna wear them down
till they give up.

16:31.323 --> 16:33.867
Have you forgotten
how we became best friends?

16:33.951 --> 16:36.829
I wore you down. I didn't leave.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.123
I squatted you, Grace.

16:39.206 --> 16:42.167
Oh, God. [chuckles] You did.

16:42.251 --> 16:43.836
And this squat is working, too.

16:44.378 --> 16:47.006
Just think of this as a slumber party.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.550
Didn't you just love those
when you were a kid?

16:49.633 --> 16:52.720
No. I never had a slumber party.

16:52.803 --> 16:55.973
You mean you never hosted?

16:56.056 --> 16:58.559
Because my friend Cathy Gleek
always hosted.

16:59.184 --> 17:02.021
No, I mean I never went to one.

17:02.563 --> 17:04.189
How is that possible?

17:04.273 --> 17:07.109
I don't know. My friends and I
weren't close like that.

17:07.609 --> 17:11.321
And also my mother thought slumber
parties were how communism spread.

17:12.114 --> 17:16.076
-What?
-She had a lot of... strange ideas.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.536
What was she like?

17:17.619 --> 17:18.704
My mother?

17:20.330 --> 17:21.498
[inhales] She was...

17:22.499 --> 17:25.085
Well, she wanted to live a life

17:25.169 --> 17:28.881
that was way bigger
than her life... could allow.

17:29.423 --> 17:33.218
When I was little, she took me to New York
to see Oklahoma! and we went backstage.

17:33.302 --> 17:36.180
She knew every one of the chorus girls

17:36.263 --> 17:38.348
and the guy that played Dream Curly.

17:39.892 --> 17:43.479
I saw this whole other life
flash across her face.

17:45.981 --> 17:47.399
And then she cried...

17:49.485 --> 17:51.111
all the way home on the train.

17:53.238 --> 17:54.698
Wow. [sighs]

17:54.782 --> 17:58.577
You forget how much happened
before we even came on the scene.

17:59.286 --> 18:02.581
My mother made me promise
to never tell that story, ever.

18:02.664 --> 18:04.166
Well, congratulations.

18:05.125 --> 18:10.339
Sharing secrets is an important part
of the successful slumber party.

18:10.422 --> 18:13.258
Well... [chuckles]
What else is supposed to happen?

18:13.634 --> 18:17.596
I suppose it's too much to hope for
"you show me yours, I'll show you mine"?

18:17.679 --> 18:19.139
You wanna have sex with me or what?

18:19.223 --> 18:21.100
[laughs]

18:21.183 --> 18:24.144
No, but I love
how uncomfortable it makes you.

18:24.228 --> 18:26.355
It doesn't make me uncomfortable.

18:26.855 --> 18:28.398
I've kissed a girl.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.485
You have not.

18:31.568 --> 18:34.154
A lot of things happened
before you came on the scene.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.865
Tell me. Tell me. Give me some.

18:39.743 --> 18:41.578
[Jeff] Honestly, I was glad you called.

18:41.662 --> 18:43.497
I'm so embarrassed about yesterday.

18:43.580 --> 18:45.999
Don't be silly.
Sol and I were just saying...

18:46.083 --> 18:48.919
Last night,
as we were cleaning the kitchen...

18:49.002 --> 18:50.504
...couples fight.

18:50.587 --> 18:52.965
We actually fought as we were
cleaning the kitchen!

18:53.632 --> 18:54.508
So, we get it.

18:54.591 --> 18:56.969
And honestly, we just survived

18:57.052 --> 18:59.805
a little rough patch of our own,
didn't we?

19:00.222 --> 19:01.431
But we got through it,

19:01.515 --> 19:04.852
-with a little help from our therapist.
-And our old friend, forgiveness.

19:05.894 --> 19:06.895
It's just... [sighs]

19:08.897 --> 19:11.441
-This is a pretty hard thing to forgive.
-[Sol sighs]

19:11.525 --> 19:14.319
Maybe you just need
to get some help, like we did.

19:14.903 --> 19:16.280
We've talked about it.

19:16.363 --> 19:17.656
I'm up to try.

19:17.739 --> 19:19.241
I'm sure Peter is, too.

19:19.324 --> 19:20.617
He knows he messed up.

19:20.701 --> 19:22.327
And open relationships are tricky.

19:23.245 --> 19:26.331
I can't imagine it's the first time
someone's stepped over the line.

19:28.584 --> 19:30.669
We don't have an open relationship.

19:30.752 --> 19:32.337
Not since we got married.

19:34.631 --> 19:35.841
Oh.

19:36.383 --> 19:37.217
Well--

19:37.301 --> 19:41.221
Did my ridiculous husband tell you
we have an open relationship?

19:44.308 --> 19:45.142
Hello?

19:45.642 --> 19:46.685
[door opens]

19:49.521 --> 19:51.356
Guess this is on, you guys.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.691
Come on, Norman.

19:58.322 --> 19:59.698
[Norman whimpers]

20:02.451 --> 20:03.535
Come on, Sol.

20:08.332 --> 20:09.333
[pigs snorting[

20:13.086 --> 20:14.922
You guys see pigs, too, right?

20:15.380 --> 20:17.174
Unfortunately, yes.

20:17.257 --> 20:18.634
What fresh hell!

20:18.717 --> 20:19.885
Okay, that's it.

20:19.968 --> 20:20.969
Hey.

20:22.679 --> 20:24.264
Hey, crazy ladies.

20:24.348 --> 20:25.807
-Wake up.
-You can't be here!

20:25.891 --> 20:28.518
Grace? Did you hear something?

20:28.936 --> 20:30.646
Yeah. A broken record.

20:30.729 --> 20:32.231
Mama's home!

20:32.314 --> 20:33.690
Who's that?

20:33.774 --> 20:37.069
-[pigs snorting]
-Hello, my pink babies!

20:37.653 --> 20:39.863
Benjamin, can you run a bath
for me and the pigs?

20:39.947 --> 20:41.907
The vet said you can't do that anymore.

20:41.990 --> 20:43.784
-Come on, girls. Come on.
-Holy crap.

20:43.867 --> 20:46.203
-Is that--
-Kareena G!

20:46.286 --> 20:47.496
Aah!

20:47.579 --> 20:49.957
[Frankie] Grace, this is Kareena G.

20:50.040 --> 20:53.418
This is the gal whose videos
I act out for you all the time.

20:53.502 --> 20:58.257
Oh! I really love the one where you try
to twerk against our dining room table.

20:58.340 --> 21:00.384
I put my own spin on it.
[chuckles]

21:00.926 --> 21:02.094
Hot!

21:02.177 --> 21:04.554
Benjamin, tell me
who's happening at me right now.

21:04.638 --> 21:06.682
Well, Gregg Allman's grandma

21:06.765 --> 21:08.517
and this ad for laundry starch

21:08.600 --> 21:11.019
have a bit trouble
letting go of their old house.

21:11.103 --> 21:14.523
I can see why. It's amaze.
But I own it now.

21:14.606 --> 21:15.983
[stammers]
Wh-- Who are they?

21:17.109 --> 21:19.861
-Oh, they're the guys putting up the wall.
-What wall?

21:19.945 --> 21:22.823
The wall to keep all the people
and paparazzi out.

21:22.906 --> 21:23.907
And Dana Carvey.

21:23.991 --> 21:26.243
But then how are you gonna
enjoy the ocean?

21:26.326 --> 21:30.497
Well, it's her house now, so she can
enjoy or not enjoy whatever she wants.

21:30.580 --> 21:32.374
Yeah! See? She gets it.

21:32.457 --> 21:35.585
Then why even buy a beach house?

21:35.669 --> 21:39.548
Well, it's less of a beach house
and more of a place to lay low. You know?

21:39.631 --> 21:42.843
Oh, no. What did you do now?

21:42.926 --> 21:45.095
Oh, we don't need to go into details.

21:45.178 --> 21:48.849
-Besides, it's none of your business.
-It's okay, it's all over social.

21:48.932 --> 21:51.310
Yeah, I think I saw this.

21:51.393 --> 21:55.230
Yeah, I was visiting an elementary school
and I was maybe a little wasted

21:55.314 --> 21:58.066
and I posted a video
of these third graders screaming

21:58.150 --> 22:00.277
"Eat shit, Kristen Bell!"

22:00.360 --> 22:03.113
-She's just too perfect.
-I get it.

22:03.196 --> 22:05.240
Anyway, [sighs]
my whole team is upset.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.659
My publicist freaked out
and so my manager says

22:07.743 --> 22:09.995
I need to hide out here,
and my mom thinks is great,

22:10.078 --> 22:12.748
because she thinks
I need to tone it down in general.

22:12.831 --> 22:16.501
I know that game because we're having
trouble with our team, too.

22:16.585 --> 22:19.087
Yeah, they're really riding us.

22:19.171 --> 22:22.591
You two put a saddle
on your backs and asked us to ride you.

22:22.674 --> 22:25.177
Can we please not talk
about riding our mothers?

22:25.260 --> 22:27.637
Yeah, I'm very uncomfortable
with that imagery.

22:27.721 --> 22:30.349
Could you call my kids?
not right now but maybe later?

22:30.432 --> 22:32.017
Totes.

22:32.100 --> 22:34.770
Uh... Okay to move that?

22:34.853 --> 22:35.729
Um...

22:36.688 --> 22:40.192
I'm sorry. I'm unclear
if this is garbage or your life.

22:40.275 --> 22:42.611
-You can move it.
-No, nothing's moving!

22:42.694 --> 22:45.489
We're not moving.
Our garbage isn't moving.

22:45.572 --> 22:48.200
And I am un-draggable. Try.

22:49.451 --> 22:51.703
-One, two, three.
-Not you!

22:53.080 --> 22:54.414
You got this, right?

22:54.498 --> 22:55.540
[sighs]

22:56.375 --> 22:57.459
Oh...

22:57.542 --> 23:00.212
Hey. Hey. You wanna see
what happens to Dana Carvey?

23:01.213 --> 23:03.882
-Oh, God, my knee!
-[Frankie] Oh, Grace! Are you okay?

23:03.965 --> 23:05.425
-[Frankie] Grace!
-[Grace] Oh!

23:05.675 --> 23:08.720
-[exhales]
-Really? You couldn't see through that?

23:09.971 --> 23:12.474
Miss G? Miss G?

23:12.557 --> 23:14.309
Fuck. Hey!

23:14.393 --> 23:16.520
-Hey.
-[both panting]

23:16.645 --> 23:20.607
I think you may not understand
what this house means to us.

23:20.690 --> 23:23.527
I mean, I had
my first slumber party here last night.

23:23.610 --> 23:25.654
Yes, like, the first ever.

23:25.737 --> 23:28.824
But that's the kind of stuff
that happens in this house:

23:28.907 --> 23:33.245
magical human stuff
that Grace is doing for the first time.

23:33.328 --> 23:35.539
Yeah. [stammers]
So, we can't leave.

23:36.957 --> 23:39.918
Except you are leaving. I'm sorry.

23:40.001 --> 23:41.628
And look, I get it.

23:41.711 --> 23:44.172
Last week I was asked
to leave the runway at LAX

23:44.256 --> 23:46.800
and I was, like,
"Then where is terminal three?"

23:46.883 --> 23:50.345
But that's just it. You're Kareena G.
You can go wherever you want.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.097
You don't belong in La Jolla.

23:52.722 --> 23:54.474
It certainly wasn't my first choice.

23:54.558 --> 23:56.810
Go do your first choice.

23:56.893 --> 23:58.145
What was your first choice?

23:58.770 --> 24:00.230
You know, somewhere chill,

24:00.313 --> 24:03.692
where I can, like, do me and party
all night but, like, thoughtfully...

24:04.317 --> 24:07.237
with people
who are spiritual, but also rich.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.531
-Real quick, snakes: yea or nay?
-They're delicious.

24:09.614 --> 24:12.367
-Okay. I know where she should go.
-[chuckles]

24:12.451 --> 24:13.493
Santa Fe.

24:13.577 --> 24:15.871
No! No, no, no, no, no.
[panting]

24:15.954 --> 24:21.042
She needs to be here, where the ocean
is calming and she can finish her album.

24:21.126 --> 24:24.212
Yeah, and she's close to LA
so you can keep tabs on her,

24:24.296 --> 24:29.718
like a rat in a cage instead of a snake
galloping free in Santa Fe.

24:29.801 --> 24:34.014
I mean, literally, down the street,
every day, a snake parade.

24:34.097 --> 24:36.558
Which is why she's not going there.

24:36.975 --> 24:39.186
Who says she's not going there?

24:39.269 --> 24:41.354
I'm sick of being told what to do.

24:41.438 --> 24:43.273
"Say this." "Don't say that."

24:43.356 --> 24:45.525
"Put that pan down, Kareena G. It's hot."

24:45.609 --> 24:47.277
[Grace] You know what we always say

24:47.360 --> 24:49.821
every time someone tries to tell us
what we shouldn't do?

24:49.905 --> 24:50.864
-"Fuck it."
-"Fuck it."

24:50.947 --> 24:53.867
-That started yesterday.
-It was the day before yesterday.

24:53.950 --> 24:55.619
Well, now it's our thing.

24:55.702 --> 24:59.664
Okay. Get ready to be, like, "What!?"

25:01.750 --> 25:05.170
-[Frankie gasps]
-[Kareena] It's Morse code for "fuck it."

25:05.253 --> 25:06.880
I see that. [imitates explosion]

25:06.963 --> 25:08.256
Frankie knows Morse code?

25:08.340 --> 25:10.967
Is that odder than anything else
you know about her?

25:11.051 --> 25:14.387
Live the tattoo.
I mean, so you got a bunch of kids

25:14.471 --> 25:18.058
to say bad things about someone
I think I know, but I'm not sure.

25:18.141 --> 25:21.311
You don't know who Kristen Bell is?
Awesome, I'm gonna tell her.

25:21.394 --> 25:25.232
But the point is, did you mess up
doing something you wanted to do?

25:25.899 --> 25:30.445
Or are you messing up doing something
that everyone else is telling you to do?

25:30.529 --> 25:32.072
Because that's what we did.

25:32.155 --> 25:35.158
Yeah. And we don't do that anymore.
I mean, you're young.

25:35.242 --> 25:37.869
You don't wanna waste your time
being someplace you don't wanna be.

25:37.953 --> 25:39.246
I love that advice.

25:44.793 --> 25:47.379
You're right. I don't wanna be here.

25:47.879 --> 25:49.881
I think I wanna try Santa Fe.

25:49.965 --> 25:51.883
Grace, call the balloon.

25:51.967 --> 25:53.260
That's it!

25:53.343 --> 25:57.681
This, right here,
that's a wrap on Benjamin Le Day.

25:57.764 --> 26:01.059
None of this Kareena G stuff.
I'm done, baby.

26:01.142 --> 26:03.478
I'm not no babysitter.
Who you think you are?

26:03.562 --> 26:05.355
I ain't studyin' you.

26:08.733 --> 26:09.776
-[Grace] Yeah!
-[Frankie] Yay.

26:10.944 --> 26:13.655
I guess our moms
are getting their house back.

26:13.738 --> 26:16.324
Now that a celebrity's on board,
I'm kinda fine with it.

26:16.408 --> 26:17.993
Well, I am not fine with it.

26:18.076 --> 26:19.661
I don't think it matters.

26:19.744 --> 26:21.997
One, two, three...

26:22.080 --> 26:24.958
[together] Eat shit, Kristen Bell!

26:25.500 --> 26:27.502
-[waves crashing]
-[birds chirping]

26:29.129 --> 26:31.506
I can't believe you guys
just squatted here.

26:31.590 --> 26:32.841
Noice.

26:33.425 --> 26:36.094
We got our house back.
[chuckles]

26:36.177 --> 26:37.721
Yeah. It worked.

26:38.346 --> 26:40.056
-You were right.
-[exhales]

26:40.307 --> 26:42.726
-[chuckles softly]
Say that again, please. [chuckles]

26:42.809 --> 26:45.103
-Don't press your luck.
-[Frankie laughing]

26:45.186 --> 26:47.105
Hey, can you do that thing again?

26:47.188 --> 26:48.273
What thing?

26:48.898 --> 26:50.567
Oh.

26:51.318 --> 26:52.360
[exhales]

26:53.069 --> 26:55.739
[meditative vocalizing]

27:02.579 --> 27:04.456
-That is amazing.
-Yeah. [chuckles]

27:04.539 --> 27:06.541
Wait till the seagulls start circling.

27:07.250 --> 27:08.501
-I wanna try it!
-Okay.

27:10.211 --> 27:15.550
[in deep voice] Oh.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.552
Channel your inner cow.

27:18.637 --> 27:21.473
[meditative vocalizing]

27:25.268 --> 27:27.312
Now ride that cow to the moon.

27:27.395 --> 27:28.813
[meditative vocalizing]

27:29.397 --> 27:30.940
I miss the pigs.

27:32.734 --> 27:33.943
