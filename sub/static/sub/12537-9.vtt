02:05.007 --> 02:07.342
- Fuck!
- Aargh!

02:31.701 --> 02:32.968
Aargh!

03:02.400 --> 03:04.401
I take it you're not
letting me in.

03:06.070 --> 03:09.573
- I don't wanna wake Ruby.
- I'll be quiet.

03:11.142 --> 03:12.943
I might not.

03:12.977 --> 03:15.646
I just wanted to see
how you were doing.

03:17.783 --> 03:20.885
Where's Max?
Where are they keeping him?

03:22.420 --> 03:26.357
They won't let us take the remains
for burial until next week.

03:28.527 --> 03:29.927
I want to see him.

03:32.264 --> 03:33.764
You don't.

03:44.876 --> 03:47.611
You know, I used to push him
out of the tree house.

03:49.281 --> 03:50.848
He'd fall right on his back.

03:51.883 --> 03:53.884
Wind knocked out of him.

03:55.354 --> 03:56.754
He'd just laugh.

03:56.789 --> 03:59.323
He always did that
when he was hurt. He'd...

04:00.359 --> 04:01.960
..just laugh.

04:04.930 --> 04:08.266
He couldn't breathe
and I...just left him there.

04:09.101 --> 04:11.369
I took off with my friends
and...

04:12.438 --> 04:14.739
I always left him behind.

04:14.774 --> 04:16.507
Alec, this isn't your fault.

04:16.541 --> 04:18.543
Oh, I know that.

04:18.577 --> 04:22.046
It was Grace. Or Jackie.
Whatever the fuck you call her.

04:22.081 --> 04:24.482
And she's gonna pay
for what she did.

04:26.085 --> 04:28.252
You wanna know
the weirdest thing?

04:29.788 --> 04:31.322
I don't blame her.

04:32.324 --> 04:35.827
You brought that bitch onto the
docks, into our house. You.

04:35.861 --> 04:38.562
You're right. This is
my fault. I know that.

04:38.597 --> 04:41.932
But right now, you and I,
we need to come together.

04:43.968 --> 04:45.969
I saw your face.

04:48.372 --> 04:53.542
When you realized
Max was dead...and not me...

04:55.579 --> 04:57.947
..I saw it in your eyes.

04:59.983 --> 05:03.285
This...disappointment.

05:03.320 --> 05:05.788
You can't believe that.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.960
You need to find a way
to forgive me.

05:10.995 --> 05:13.296
I can't afford to lose
another son.

05:13.330 --> 05:15.231
Alec...

05:16.066 --> 05:18.301
One day you're gonna lead
this family.

05:18.335 --> 05:21.271
Family? What family?

05:23.174 --> 05:25.308
You call this a family?

05:49.235 --> 05:51.270
Open wide.

06:04.185 --> 06:06.186
(Chatter)

06:08.022 --> 06:10.891
- Are hers the only ones?
- Okay. Yeah.

06:16.832 --> 06:19.200
- We're done.
- Alright.

06:22.338 --> 06:23.805
Can I help you?

06:23.840 --> 06:26.208
Detective Lucas Mitchell.
San Jose PD.

06:26.242 --> 06:28.777
I'd like to speak with
Detective Travis, please.

06:28.812 --> 06:30.813
Get in line.
One children's drawing.

06:30.847 --> 06:33.582
Excuse me.
I trained her. We're friends.

06:34.484 --> 06:37.119
I just wanna go in
and make sure she's okay.

06:37.153 --> 06:39.555
Five minutes, please.

06:41.725 --> 06:43.126
Five minutes.

06:50.467 --> 06:52.802
You shouldn't be seen with me.

06:57.942 --> 07:00.778
Just tell me
it was self-defense.

07:03.549 --> 07:05.250
Yes.

07:15.929 --> 07:17.896
Tell them everything, Grace.

07:17.931 --> 07:19.865
Cooperate.

07:19.899 --> 07:22.534
Don't give 'em another reason
to crucify you.

07:22.568 --> 07:26.071
There is still a mole
in the department, Mitch.

07:27.473 --> 07:30.575
If I start talking,
if I tell them what I know,

07:32.111 --> 07:34.746
I'll be dead before I get
in front of the judge.

07:34.781 --> 07:36.982
Oh, they've got me
right where they want me.

07:37.016 --> 07:40.852
They can kill me ten different ways
before I get to the arraignment.

07:42.321 --> 07:44.322
Mitch...

07:44.357 --> 07:46.057
just walk away.

07:46.092 --> 07:47.859
Before they get to you, too.

07:53.832 --> 07:57.701
You know, when cops lose it, people think
it's because something big happened.

07:58.469 --> 08:00.470
You know,
they shoot an innocent

08:00.504 --> 08:03.540
or their wife leaves them -
something like that.

08:03.574 --> 08:07.377
But I just woke up one day and I couldn't
face another shitty fucking alley

08:07.411 --> 08:09.446
and looking at
another dead body.

08:11.348 --> 08:13.416
My nerve...

08:15.987 --> 08:18.889
It just vanished. One day
to the next, it was gone.

08:20.858 --> 08:24.761
I transferred out of here, took
that desk job in San Jose.

08:27.532 --> 08:29.733
I stopped giving a shit.

08:29.768 --> 08:32.470
I was sleepwalking, Travis.

08:32.504 --> 08:34.571
You woke me up.

08:36.541 --> 08:38.909
I'm not gonna
disappear on you now.

08:39.945 --> 08:42.813
- I'm so scared.
- Hey. It's okay. It's okay.

08:42.847 --> 08:44.415
Toughen up.

08:45.317 --> 08:48.286
You let me just see who
comes out of the woodwork.

08:48.321 --> 08:50.823
Thank you.

09:03.604 --> 09:06.973
- Where is she?
- Being processed.

09:07.008 --> 09:11.845
Okay, what we have is a decorated
but emotionally unstable officer

09:11.879 --> 09:15.048
who took the law into her own
hands with tragic consequences.

09:15.082 --> 09:19.853
Get a confession and get her
downstairs in a timely fashion.

09:19.887 --> 09:21.955
- No surprises.
- Sir.

09:21.989 --> 09:25.025
With all due respect,
it may not be that simple.

09:25.059 --> 09:27.327
Travis is nothing
if not stubborn.

09:27.361 --> 09:30.930
Correct me if I'm wrong, but this whole
clusterfuck happened on your watch,

09:30.965 --> 09:32.799
didn't it?

09:33.734 --> 09:37.570
- Yes, sir. - Grace Travis was your
responsibility, wasn't she?

09:38.472 --> 09:42.809
- Yes. - You have one chance to get
this situation under control

09:42.843 --> 09:45.078
before the media
run wild with it.

09:45.112 --> 09:47.313
I will not see my career

09:47.348 --> 09:51.217
sacrificed on the altar of
your incompetence, Lieutenant.

09:53.254 --> 09:54.387
Sir.

09:54.421 --> 09:57.323
We need to bring
Internal Affairs in on this.

09:57.758 --> 09:59.592
Leave that to me.

10:02.829 --> 10:05.197
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Grace Travis.

10:05.231 --> 10:07.366
- She's my wife.
- Give me a second.

10:07.400 --> 10:10.235
She was arrested earlier
this evening, brought here.

10:10.269 --> 10:13.071
I suggest you take a seat, sir.

10:13.105 --> 10:14.805
Okay.

10:14.840 --> 10:16.874
Fine. Let's go.

10:20.044 --> 10:23.480
They'll probably go after you for
murder so you plead to manslaughter.

10:23.514 --> 10:26.216
I know what they're gonna do.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.719
I've been on the other side
of this table 100 times.

10:28.753 --> 10:32.422
They've got your prints on a gun
which puts you at the crime scene.

10:33.591 --> 10:35.759
It's clear what their line
on motive will be.

10:37.428 --> 10:40.463
Let's see what they come up
with in the interview.

10:40.498 --> 10:43.300
Anything you wanna tell me
now that may help?

10:44.469 --> 10:46.436
No.

10:58.916 --> 11:00.583
- (JIMMY) Excuse me.
- Yes?

11:00.618 --> 11:04.220
I'd like to speak to whoever's in
charge of the Max Laszlo murder.

11:08.659 --> 11:10.226
Dad?

11:10.260 --> 11:13.396
Dad, that's the guy
from the neighborhood watch.

11:14.264 --> 11:17.000
- Yeah, I know.
- What's he doing here?

11:17.802 --> 11:20.103
Lieutenant, I should be
in on this interview.

11:20.137 --> 11:22.839
No, you should be directing
traffic at the Coliseum.

11:22.873 --> 11:24.908
I was her handler.
She trusts me.

11:24.942 --> 11:27.510
You're not listening.
It's over.

11:27.545 --> 11:29.612
You knew Grace was back under
and you lied about it

11:29.647 --> 11:31.781
and you covered up
the attempt on her life.

11:31.816 --> 11:35.285
That's a career-ender, even
without your sordid romance

11:35.320 --> 11:37.588
with confidential informant
number 237.

11:37.622 --> 11:40.124
That is...complicated,
Lieutenant.

11:40.159 --> 11:42.326
I gave you fair warning.

11:42.361 --> 11:43.761
You're done.

11:43.796 --> 11:46.064
Expect a call from IAD.

12:08.722 --> 12:11.023
Could you come with me, sir?

12:18.165 --> 12:20.199
Stay here.

12:20.934 --> 12:23.369
Hey. Who was that?

12:23.403 --> 12:25.504
You don't read the papers?

12:41.321 --> 12:43.455
I'm Deputy Chief Campbell.

12:43.489 --> 12:46.692
I'm taking personal charge
of your son's case.

12:46.726 --> 12:48.126
You mean his murder?

12:48.161 --> 12:51.897
There's been an arrest.
Her name is Grace Travis.

12:51.931 --> 12:54.232
You know her better
as Jackie Hays.

12:55.134 --> 12:57.536
What's she saying?
Is she admitting to it?

12:57.570 --> 13:01.673
- I can't discuss that.
- Is she here? I want to see her.

13:01.708 --> 13:03.375
I'm sorry.
That's not possible.

13:03.409 --> 13:06.411
You will be free to attend her
arraignment - if there is one.

13:06.446 --> 13:07.946
I wanna know what happened.

13:07.981 --> 13:10.014
We'll get to the bottom
of it, Mr Laszlo.

13:10.049 --> 13:13.184
- Sir. Mr Laszlo.
- What happens next?

13:14.053 --> 13:16.488
She will likely be charged
within 24 hours.

13:16.522 --> 13:20.324
She'll then be transported to Oakland
County to await arraignment.

13:20.359 --> 13:24.362
She's a police officer but she will
receive no special treatment from us.

13:24.396 --> 13:28.465
While you're here, we'd appreciate
it if you'd answer some questions.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.567
You want to interrogate me?

13:30.602 --> 13:34.004
Just a few questions. It may help
bring your son's killer to justice.

13:34.039 --> 13:36.240
No-one wants that
more than me.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.632
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, shit.

15:08.666 --> 15:11.235
I was gonna ask you
the same question.

15:12.470 --> 15:15.338
- You working for Jimmy?
- Excuse me, Detective?

15:15.373 --> 15:17.207
Are you working
for Jimmy Laszlo?

15:17.241 --> 15:20.444
I heard you the first time.
I just had to hear it again.

15:20.478 --> 15:22.045
You know I'm getting the axe?

15:22.080 --> 15:25.682
Well, shat-on ex-cops don't make
very effective police moles.

15:25.717 --> 15:28.252
I'm sure you can be effective
when you need to be.

15:28.286 --> 15:30.220
Look, you're right.

15:30.254 --> 15:32.222
Jimmy's got somebody
in the department.

15:32.256 --> 15:34.424
They've been two steps
ahead of us for years.

15:34.458 --> 15:37.794
And no-one's that smart.
Not even me.

15:38.696 --> 15:41.498
What are you doing at his offices
in the middle of the night?

15:41.532 --> 15:43.533
I don't got
that many moves left.

15:43.568 --> 15:46.169
If I find out who the mole
is, bring him in,

15:46.204 --> 15:48.071
and that person's higher up
than me,

15:48.106 --> 15:50.674
I might have enough leverage
to keep my pension.

15:51.843 --> 15:53.878
Trust me or not,
I don't give a fuck.

15:53.912 --> 15:55.613
I saw you, you know.

15:56.615 --> 15:59.984
Stealing recovered evidence
from Max Laszlo's body.

16:01.586 --> 16:02.986
His fucking keys.

16:04.021 --> 16:07.523
Why don't we take a poke around
while Jimmy's down the station?

16:08.592 --> 16:10.927
Alright. Jesus Christ.

16:10.961 --> 16:13.396
When did you first meet
Jackie Hays?

16:14.764 --> 16:17.900
Summer last year.
August, I think.

16:18.801 --> 16:21.669
She started doing favors
for me around the docks.

16:21.704 --> 16:24.138
What kind of favors?

16:24.173 --> 16:27.208
She introduced me to a few
business opportunities.

16:27.243 --> 16:29.478
Legitimate, of course.

16:29.512 --> 16:31.780
Were you aware she was
an undercover officer?

16:31.815 --> 16:33.148
No, I was not.

16:33.183 --> 16:35.384
When did you become aware
she was undercover?

16:35.418 --> 16:37.353
A few hours ago, on the news.

16:39.489 --> 16:43.626
At no point did you suspect Jackie
Hays might have been law enforcement?

16:43.661 --> 16:45.128
No.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.732
I've met undercover cops
in the docks before.

16:48.766 --> 16:51.001
You can smell them a mile away.

16:51.035 --> 16:55.405
Jackie was unlike any
undercover cop I've met before.

16:55.439 --> 16:57.006
Why?

16:57.041 --> 16:59.508
After our introduction,

16:59.543 --> 17:02.178
she had zero interest
in my business dealings.

17:02.212 --> 17:04.380
No interest
in union corruption.

17:04.415 --> 17:06.749
Missing containers.
Drugs. WMDs.

17:06.784 --> 17:09.786
All the usual stuff that cops
like to obsess about.

17:09.819 --> 17:11.755
What did she talk about?

17:12.924 --> 17:14.457
Her son.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.560
Sam?

17:16.594 --> 17:19.096
She talked about Sam,
as Jackie?

17:19.130 --> 17:24.166
She confided in me that Sam had
been killed in a drive-by shooting.

17:25.270 --> 17:29.540
And she was gonna find the killer
since the police couldn't.

17:29.575 --> 17:32.910
It was at that time
I started to worry about her.

17:32.944 --> 17:34.578
About her mental state.

17:34.613 --> 17:36.914
What worried you exactly?

17:36.948 --> 17:39.717
At times she seemed delusional.

17:39.751 --> 17:43.454
I started to distance myself
but then my son...

17:46.624 --> 17:50.761
My son Max came home and she
became fixated on him.

17:52.297 --> 17:53.665
How do you mean?

17:53.699 --> 17:57.102
She got it in her head
that Max had killed her son.

17:57.136 --> 17:58.437
Max?

17:58.771 --> 18:03.074
Which is insane, because Max was
incarcerated at the time of the shooting.

18:03.109 --> 18:06.678
Of course, now it's clear
what she was planning.

18:06.713 --> 18:09.381
My regret is that I let her
into my life.

18:09.415 --> 18:13.084
That I allowed the relationship
to progress as far as it did

18:13.119 --> 18:16.287
before I could see
how disturbed she was.

18:21.593 --> 18:23.594
How far did it progress?

18:25.229 --> 18:27.397
She's your undercover agent.

18:27.431 --> 18:29.799
You must know how effective
she can be.

18:31.335 --> 18:34.637
We need you to be
perfectly clear, Mr Laszlo.

18:34.671 --> 18:37.873
Did you and Grace Travis
have a sexual relationship?

18:40.242 --> 18:43.111
She was always just...

18:43.145 --> 18:45.247
Jackie to me.

18:48.552 --> 18:50.453
What is taking you guys
so long?

18:50.487 --> 18:53.323
We have a situation
that requires IAD now.

18:53.357 --> 18:56.260
'What situation?
What are you talking about?'

18:56.294 --> 18:58.028
Nobody called you?

19:02.134 --> 19:04.202
You sure this is his office?

19:08.407 --> 19:10.408
This is all his mail.

19:19.985 --> 19:21.953
What did they pull
off the body?

19:21.987 --> 19:25.156
Oh, you know.
Watch, keys - usual.

19:25.190 --> 19:27.492
Everything was burnt
to a crisp.

19:27.526 --> 19:29.794
Grace really did a number
on him.

19:29.829 --> 19:31.796
Allegedly did a number on him.

19:31.831 --> 19:33.632
Aren't you adorable!

19:44.710 --> 19:46.711
Oh. Hey, wait a minute.

19:48.714 --> 19:51.082
Santa Rita County.

19:53.152 --> 19:55.887
He was writing to somebody
from prison.

20:01.893 --> 20:04.128
What is that? Code?

20:04.162 --> 20:06.030
Chess moves. Yeah.

20:08.534 --> 20:11.470
Yeah. He was carrying on
a game from the inside.

20:12.138 --> 20:13.672
I wonder who with.

20:15.376 --> 20:17.377
Rufus Zapata.

20:17.878 --> 20:20.881
Mr Travis. Sorry to keep you.

20:20.915 --> 20:22.916
What's going on?
Where is my wife?

20:22.951 --> 20:25.686
If you come with me,
I'll answer your questions

20:25.720 --> 20:27.854
and hopefully you can answer
some of mine.

20:28.589 --> 20:31.124
It would be very helpful
for Grace.

20:31.158 --> 20:33.493
No. I don't want to leave
my daughter.

20:33.527 --> 20:35.895
- You look after her.
- I'll be fine.

20:35.930 --> 20:37.731
Okay.

20:38.366 --> 20:40.133
Come on.

20:40.167 --> 20:44.137
How much did you know about your
wife's relationship to Jimmy Laszlo?

20:46.206 --> 20:48.408
We never discussed her work.

20:48.442 --> 20:53.446
Did she tell you she and Mr Laszlo were...
sleeping together?

21:01.790 --> 21:03.624
Like I said...

21:03.658 --> 21:05.859
we never talked about her work.

21:09.163 --> 21:11.532
But Grace wasn't undercover.

21:12.534 --> 21:16.236
She was on leave.
You knew that, right?

21:22.344 --> 21:24.711
She told me
she was back on the job.

21:24.745 --> 21:27.547
Any work she did
with Jimmy Laszlo was...

21:27.581 --> 21:29.015
extracurricular.

21:30.218 --> 21:32.719
I know you're trying
to get a rise out of me.

21:32.754 --> 21:34.421
- It's not about that, Tom.
- Oh...

21:34.455 --> 21:36.490
Can I call you Tom?

21:42.863 --> 21:44.764
Did Grace tell you
what she planned to do

21:44.799 --> 21:47.066
once she found who killed Sam?

21:50.571 --> 21:53.773
Did she tell you how far
she was willing to go?

21:56.344 --> 21:59.546
Sleeping with Jimmy,
burning bodies.

22:01.582 --> 22:03.683
Is there nothing
she wouldn't do?

22:06.787 --> 22:09.523
Talk to me, Tom.
You can still help your wife.

22:18.634 --> 22:21.035
You know what?

22:21.070 --> 22:25.540
Maybe if you'd done your fucking
job, none of this would've happened.

22:25.575 --> 22:28.377
She gave her life -
our life -

22:28.411 --> 22:30.179
to this fucking job!

22:31.815 --> 22:34.984
And where were you when she needed you?
You left her out in the cold.

22:36.220 --> 22:40.591
What do you expect? Now you want to
crucify her for doing your fucking job?

22:40.625 --> 22:42.626
For chasing down
the son of a bitch who...

22:42.660 --> 22:44.694
Who what, Tom? Who what?

22:49.933 --> 22:51.433
Am I free to go?

22:53.870 --> 22:55.904
I have a daughter
to look after.

22:58.974 --> 23:00.608
So what grade you in?

23:01.776 --> 23:03.144
Ninth.

23:03.178 --> 23:05.947
You do good in school?

23:05.981 --> 23:08.483
I do well in school. Yes.

23:10.252 --> 23:13.088
What do you wanna be
when you grow up?

23:14.457 --> 23:17.426
A cop. Just like my mom.

23:20.963 --> 23:23.265
(Door opens)

23:27.536 --> 23:29.771
Must be getting
pretty crowded next door.

23:29.805 --> 23:31.973
Yeah, a little bit.

23:33.775 --> 23:35.310
So who's in there?

23:36.278 --> 23:40.515
The usual suspects.
Duffy, Campbell, McClintock.

23:40.549 --> 23:42.650
Well, tell them to come
and say hello,

23:42.685 --> 23:45.253
instead of hiding out there
in observation.

23:56.866 --> 24:00.036
Do you want to see
your husband and daughter?

24:00.070 --> 24:02.305
I can give you a couple
of minutes if you want.

24:04.175 --> 24:05.775
They're here?

24:05.810 --> 24:07.844
- Evie?
- Dad, what happened?

24:09.280 --> 24:11.347
What is it?

24:13.550 --> 24:15.584
Let's go.

24:15.619 --> 24:19.521
Mr Travis. I can give you a couple
of minutes with your wife now.

24:19.555 --> 24:21.957
- We're leaving.
- Excuse me?

24:21.991 --> 24:23.625
Dad, what are you
talking about?

24:23.659 --> 24:26.060
- You don't wanna see her?
- We gotta go.

24:26.095 --> 24:27.261
Dad...

24:27.296 --> 24:30.397
Listen, sweetheart,
I'm sorry, but we gotta go.

24:30.432 --> 24:32.366
- We gotta go home.
- No.

24:32.400 --> 24:34.101
I'm staying. I wanna see her.

24:34.135 --> 24:36.303
Listen, you need
to get some sleep.

24:36.337 --> 24:39.439
- No, it's Mom.
- Hey, Evie, just...

24:40.273 --> 24:42.275
Please. Trust me on this one.

24:42.309 --> 24:44.343
We gotta go.

24:45.612 --> 24:47.747
Let's go.

24:58.757 --> 25:00.992
Where are they?

25:01.026 --> 25:03.160
I'm sorry but they've gone.

25:03.195 --> 25:05.129
Gone?

25:05.163 --> 25:07.097
What are you talking about?

25:07.132 --> 25:08.799
They left.

25:08.833 --> 25:11.334
Did you tell them
that they could see me?

25:11.369 --> 25:12.702
I did.

25:12.736 --> 25:15.839
Your husband chose to leave.
I'm sorry.

25:18.475 --> 25:20.510
I don't understand.

25:20.544 --> 25:22.979
You've put them through
a lot, Grace.

25:23.013 --> 25:25.181
- Fuck you.
- Okay. Hey.

25:25.215 --> 25:27.250
But I'm still willing
to listen to you.

25:27.284 --> 25:29.151
- Fuck you.
- You're provoking my client.

25:29.186 --> 25:30.653
Fuck you.

25:31.655 --> 25:34.056
You only get one chance
to cooperate here.

25:35.058 --> 25:36.826
That's straight from the top.

25:38.195 --> 25:41.831
You want professional
courtesy, you help us.

25:42.832 --> 25:45.868
If not, we treat you like
any other perp,

25:45.903 --> 25:48.003
put you in general holding.

26:04.855 --> 26:08.858
How do you explain the wounds
on your face and your body?

26:10.160 --> 26:13.730
I was in a car accident and
I fell asleep at the wheel.

26:15.033 --> 26:16.533
I hit a truck.

26:17.568 --> 26:19.569
- Did you report this accident?
- No.

26:19.604 --> 26:22.205
I'm sure you know that already.

26:22.239 --> 26:24.040
So you left the scene
of an accident?

26:24.075 --> 26:25.909
Charge me.

26:25.943 --> 26:29.279
We have your fingerprints on a
gun found at the murder scene.

26:29.314 --> 26:30.814
Do you want to explain that?

26:30.848 --> 26:32.783
No, she doesn't.

26:32.817 --> 26:35.619
Forensics are going over
the entire pier.

26:36.855 --> 26:40.824
You may have torched the scene and it
may take us longer to get results,

26:40.858 --> 26:44.729
but are you willing to bet they're not
gonna find your DNA inside that pier?

26:44.763 --> 26:46.865
I was a UC at the docks.

26:46.899 --> 26:49.935
There's a million reasons
why my DNA would be there.

26:52.238 --> 26:53.605
What about Max Laszlo?

26:53.640 --> 26:56.375
Will they find his DNA
under your fingernails?

26:56.410 --> 26:59.045
- You don't have answer.
- No. No, I'm okay.

27:00.547 --> 27:03.282
I had plenty of run-ins
with Max Laszlo.

27:03.317 --> 27:05.285
Yeah, it's entirely possible.

27:07.521 --> 27:11.558
And will they find Jimmy Laszlo's
DNA under your fingernails, too?

27:13.427 --> 27:15.661
What the hell has that
got to do with anything?

27:15.696 --> 27:19.198
Or maybe they'll find his DNA
elsewhere on your person.

27:21.401 --> 27:25.171
What was the true nature of your
relationship with Jimmy Laszlo, Grace?

27:25.205 --> 27:28.007
- Excuse me?
- How long, Grace?

27:29.075 --> 27:31.978
How long were you two
sleeping together?

27:32.012 --> 27:34.880
What evidence do you have
to support these accusations?

27:34.915 --> 27:37.150
We have a statement
from Mr Laszlo.

27:37.184 --> 27:39.719
He came in voluntarily.

27:40.721 --> 27:42.688
He had lots of interesting
things to say.

27:42.722 --> 27:44.924
He's lying.
Just think about it.

27:44.958 --> 27:47.994
- He has every...
- Grace, stop talking. Now.

27:48.529 --> 27:51.130
If there was
a sexual relationship,

27:51.832 --> 27:55.568
it will come out at trial.
You know that.

27:55.602 --> 27:57.637
My client has nothing more
to say.

27:57.671 --> 28:00.807
No defense lawyer will ever
risk putting you on the stand.

28:05.046 --> 28:07.847
You just fucked your own trial.

28:10.418 --> 28:12.152
Now...

28:12.954 --> 28:14.956
..do you want to cooperate?

28:14.990 --> 28:18.726
I'd like to consult with
my client in private, please.

28:22.030 --> 28:24.566
Any credibility
you may have had is gone.

28:24.600 --> 28:28.336
Any sympathy the jury
may have had for you is gone.

28:28.371 --> 28:31.273
You've gotta plead.
You've got to cooperate.

28:33.443 --> 28:34.844
Is that your advice?

28:34.878 --> 28:36.346
That's my advice.

28:36.380 --> 28:38.081
Then I want another lawyer.

28:42.153 --> 28:44.020
I wanna go to lockup.

28:48.993 --> 28:51.362
Sir, IAD is asking for you.

28:52.464 --> 28:54.365
IAD?

28:54.400 --> 28:56.434
What's the situation?

28:56.468 --> 29:00.171
We had to pause the interview.
She just fired her lawyer.

29:01.106 --> 29:03.408
Had to put her in holding
until we find another one.

29:03.443 --> 29:05.944
- We need to talk to her.
- Of course. Of course.

29:05.978 --> 29:09.648
But you think she's gonna let
you without a lawyer present?

29:11.418 --> 29:13.486
You guys should get
some coffee.

29:15.589 --> 29:17.590
(Music blaring from car)

29:27.603 --> 29:29.604
(Music off)

29:46.188 --> 29:48.189
(Sniffs)

30:21.455 --> 30:23.423
(Door bursts open)

30:25.726 --> 30:27.393
The party's over.

30:27.895 --> 30:29.462
Kiddies.

30:30.330 --> 30:32.332
Who the fuck are you?

30:33.867 --> 30:37.003
I'm the fucking landlord.
Get the fuck out.

30:37.939 --> 30:41.541
There's no landlord here. This
place has been vacant for years.

30:42.643 --> 30:44.544
I grew up in this house.

30:44.578 --> 30:46.279
Show some fucking respect.

30:48.615 --> 30:50.283
It's what you need, bro.

30:54.421 --> 30:56.689
You know who my father is?

30:56.724 --> 30:58.758
No. Tell me.

30:59.693 --> 31:01.895
Jimmy Laszlo.

31:03.297 --> 31:05.298
(Laughter)

31:09.036 --> 31:11.571
Shit. That name supposed
to mean something?

31:13.841 --> 31:15.409
Yeah?

31:16.545 --> 31:18.212
Jimmy...

31:18.947 --> 31:20.614
Jimmy what again?

31:23.818 --> 31:25.486
Laszlo.

31:26.855 --> 31:28.655
Looky here, see.

31:28.690 --> 31:31.258
We got a nice little
evening going down here.

31:31.826 --> 31:35.395
I don't want to spoil it, putting
brains all over this nice wallpaper.

31:35.430 --> 31:37.597
Did your daddy put up
that wallpaper?

31:40.301 --> 31:44.237
Off...you...go.

31:54.714 --> 31:56.381
"Show some respect."

31:56.983 --> 31:58.650
(Laughter)

32:02.521 --> 32:04.188
What the fuck?

32:05.157 --> 32:07.157
Oh, shit.

32:07.192 --> 32:08.892
Laszlo...

32:18.437 --> 32:20.104
What the fuck?

32:46.931 --> 32:48.932
Where the fuck is everybody?

32:49.367 --> 32:50.767
I called a meeting.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.402
I told everyone but they're...

32:52.437 --> 32:54.438
Cowards, that's what they are.

32:54.472 --> 32:56.673
No sense of loyalty.
Rats leaving the...

32:56.708 --> 32:58.075
The sinking ship, yeah.

32:58.109 --> 32:59.810
What about it, Joe?

33:00.245 --> 33:01.912
They're scared, boss.

33:02.647 --> 33:05.983
When they found out about Jackie
being, like, a cop an' all...

33:06.017 --> 33:08.151
They'll crawl back
when the heat blows over.

33:08.186 --> 33:09.853
Least you know
who your friends are.

33:09.887 --> 33:11.588
Yeah.

33:12.323 --> 33:15.925
Last night, Jackie Hays -
that fucking cunt -

33:15.960 --> 33:18.161
was picked up for the murder
of my son.

33:18.696 --> 33:22.232
She's being transferred to Oakland
County within the next 24 hours.

33:22.266 --> 33:25.001
Now, who do we have
on the inside

33:25.035 --> 33:26.736
who can handle this?

33:28.005 --> 33:30.372
- Sabrina Christi.
- Right.

33:30.407 --> 33:32.174
She's doing life
without parole.

33:32.208 --> 33:35.911
We make things a little more comfortable
for her in there, she'll do it.

33:35.945 --> 33:37.913
Give her whatever she wants.

33:37.947 --> 33:40.849
And tell her to make it
fucking painful.

33:44.421 --> 33:46.422
Where's Alec, boss?

33:57.335 --> 33:58.768
Alec.

33:58.803 --> 34:01.171
- Oh, my God, baby.
- Oh, relax. It's okay.

34:02.140 --> 34:04.742
- What happened to you?
- It's nothing.

34:07.078 --> 34:09.045
What's for breakfast?

34:09.347 --> 34:11.348
Breakfast?

34:11.949 --> 34:14.150
I could murder some eggs.

34:18.489 --> 34:20.690
I've been up all night
worried about you.

34:20.725 --> 34:22.426
Oh, God, I'm starving.

34:24.094 --> 34:26.163
Where were you?

34:26.197 --> 34:28.998
Please, Cath, I need
to have a clear head.

34:29.034 --> 34:30.967
Today's gonna be a big day.

34:33.438 --> 34:35.438
What are you talking about?

34:37.275 --> 34:39.275
Today's the day.

34:42.614 --> 34:44.614
What about Jimmy?

34:45.817 --> 34:47.818
Me and my father are done.

34:52.023 --> 34:54.091
Where the fuck are those eggs?

35:15.813 --> 35:17.914
(Dog barking)

35:22.853 --> 35:25.054
Jesus tap-dancing
Christ, what?

35:25.089 --> 35:26.489
Are you Rufus Zapata?

35:26.523 --> 35:28.792
Rufus is in the park
like he always is.

35:28.826 --> 35:30.793
Oh. What's he look like?

35:30.828 --> 35:34.430
He looks like a guy playing three
games of chess at the same time.

35:34.465 --> 35:36.499
Thank you very much, sir.

35:43.975 --> 35:46.944
Too bad what happened.
Max was a smart kid.

35:46.978 --> 35:49.580
- Nice guy, too.
- A nice guy?

35:49.614 --> 35:52.149
You know he went to prison
for assaulting an officer?

35:52.183 --> 35:55.218
Of course.
I saw it happen.

35:55.252 --> 35:58.688
- That happen here?
- Mm-hm.

35:58.723 --> 36:00.724
So would you like to
tell us about it?

36:03.995 --> 36:07.130
Mr Zapata, Max Laszlo is dead.

36:07.165 --> 36:11.535
Any information you give us could
help us bring his killer to justice.

36:14.438 --> 36:16.640
We had a game going after dark.

36:16.674 --> 36:19.576
5-O rolls up, says we can't
be in the park after 10.

36:19.610 --> 36:21.111
Fine, I said.

36:21.145 --> 36:24.982
But Max, who weighs maybe
a buck-50 soaking wet,

36:25.016 --> 36:28.051
charges right up and cracks
the cop on the head.

36:28.085 --> 36:30.854
Hit him four or five times
before the cop even reacted.

36:30.889 --> 36:32.990
Like he was trying to get hit.

36:33.025 --> 36:37.228
The other cop had to jump
in and save his pussy ass.

36:37.263 --> 36:38.964
From Max. (Laughs)

36:41.801 --> 36:43.434
All right, thanks.

36:44.236 --> 36:49.107
What Oakland cop would let Max Laszlo
get four or five good hits in?

36:49.141 --> 36:51.509
He must have seen his arrest sheet.
Who was it?

36:51.543 --> 36:54.245
Richard Stecky was
the arresting officer.

36:55.247 --> 36:57.848
I don't recall
who the punch bag was.

37:13.666 --> 37:15.533
The name's been redacted.

37:15.568 --> 37:19.204
Kept out of public record due to
the sordid history of the Laszlos

37:19.238 --> 37:22.273
intimidating witnesses
and victims of crime.

37:22.308 --> 37:24.876
I want to know
who that cop was.

37:24.911 --> 37:26.345
If Max beat him hard enough,

37:26.379 --> 37:29.682
there might be a medical report
in there with the original notes.

37:29.717 --> 37:31.985
- Yeah. Yeah.
- (Phone rings)

37:34.922 --> 37:36.223
Yeah, it's Wilson.

37:36.257 --> 37:37.992
'Need you back
at the Precinct.'

37:38.026 --> 37:40.060
Yes, I'll be there.

38:02.782 --> 38:06.084
Hey, I've just... I've just
got a question for you.

38:06.118 --> 38:08.686
Something's kind of
been bothering me.

38:12.992 --> 38:15.059
Why are you
carrying this around?

38:17.629 --> 38:19.697
My son drew it before he died.

38:23.436 --> 38:25.103
What's it supposed to be?

38:26.272 --> 38:28.473
I don't know.

39:18.625 --> 39:20.125
I know you.

39:20.160 --> 39:22.928
- You don't know me.
- Sure I do.

39:24.031 --> 39:26.498
I locked you up in Fruitvale
two years ago.

39:26.533 --> 39:28.867
(Laughs) What are you?
A cop?

39:30.937 --> 39:33.839
(Shouting)

39:35.241 --> 39:37.542
She pulled my hair right out!
Fucking cunt!

39:37.576 --> 39:40.245
Take her down!
Take her down!

39:42.948 --> 39:44.883
Stop it!

39:46.719 --> 39:48.720
(Shouting)

40:44.476 --> 40:48.913
Whatever they say about you guys, no-one
can say IAD don't dress for success.

40:48.947 --> 40:51.916
Detective Wilson,
it appears you've been

40:51.950 --> 40:55.119
getting away with a lot of
shit for a long time.

40:55.153 --> 40:57.488
Regrets...I've had a few.

40:57.522 --> 41:00.224
Withholding information.
Obstruction of justice.

41:00.258 --> 41:03.893
Falsifying the identity
of a confidential informant.

41:03.928 --> 41:07.230
Sexual misconduct with
a confidential informant.

41:07.264 --> 41:10.800
No, she wouldn't use that word "misconduct".
That's your word.

41:10.834 --> 41:13.002
Running a UC
without authorization.

41:13.036 --> 41:15.538
- Concealing evidence.
- Alright, I get the picture.

41:15.572 --> 41:17.806
I'm gonna get shit-canned.

41:17.841 --> 41:20.175
Is there any way
we can speed this up?

41:23.380 --> 41:24.980
Let's talk about Grace Travis.

41:26.516 --> 41:28.717
I'll take that as a no.

41:37.093 --> 41:39.327
Ma'am, can you follow
the light, please?

41:39.362 --> 41:40.996
Ma'am, we need you to respond.

41:57.615 --> 41:59.617
Okay.

42:00.719 --> 42:02.720
We all know money's been down.

42:03.722 --> 42:05.890
Earnings have been bad
for years.

42:05.925 --> 42:08.059
- (Door opens)
- You're late.

42:11.397 --> 42:13.832
- Where's Jimmy?
- Jimmy's not here.

42:13.866 --> 42:15.734
I called this meeting.

42:15.768 --> 42:19.204
- What the fuck is this?
- Either stay...or leave.

42:20.273 --> 42:22.541
It's your choice.

42:24.343 --> 42:27.178
Times have been tough.
I can live with that.

42:27.213 --> 42:29.381
What I cannot live with

42:29.415 --> 42:31.850
is we had an undercover cop
on our docks,

42:31.884 --> 42:34.052
sticking her nose
into our business.

42:35.254 --> 42:37.322
And the worst part about it?

42:37.891 --> 42:40.459
My father knew all along.

42:40.494 --> 42:42.161
- No fucking way.
- Come on.

42:42.195 --> 42:43.829
- Way out of line.
- Lloyd.

42:43.863 --> 42:45.965
It's the truth.

42:46.933 --> 42:48.701
How do we know that?

42:48.735 --> 42:51.504
Go ahead. Ask him.

42:52.973 --> 42:55.140
See what he says.

42:56.709 --> 43:00.578
My father knew Jackie Hays was an
undercover cop and he did nothing about it.

43:00.613 --> 43:03.548
He knew and he carried on
with her,

43:03.582 --> 43:06.551
endangering your lives,
your livelihoods,

43:07.319 --> 43:09.954
your fucking freedom,
your families.

43:12.458 --> 43:14.526
And now my brother is dead.

43:15.628 --> 43:19.663
Killed by the very hand of the cop
my father invited into our world.

43:22.533 --> 43:24.935
Now, I love my father,

43:24.969 --> 43:27.404
but I will not follow him
one more goddamn day.

43:27.439 --> 43:29.473
You're fucking
moving against him?

43:29.507 --> 43:31.608
That's exactly
what's happening.

43:31.642 --> 43:33.343
The train is leaving
the station.

43:33.377 --> 43:35.845
He's the only one
who doesn't know it.

43:36.580 --> 43:39.148
You know how close you are
to going to jail?

43:39.183 --> 43:40.817
Hm?

43:40.851 --> 43:43.420
All of us.

43:43.454 --> 43:46.623
Cos some fucking broad
gave him a hard-on.

43:46.658 --> 43:49.360
It's the oldest goddamn trick
in the book.

43:49.394 --> 43:51.696
Now...

43:51.730 --> 43:53.765
I say it is time for a change.

43:54.700 --> 43:57.336
It is time
to start earning again.

43:57.370 --> 43:59.972
New leadership.
New guard.

44:00.006 --> 44:02.107
New start.

44:04.844 --> 44:06.845
Who's with me?

44:13.318 --> 44:15.519
Fuck it. I'm in.

44:22.826 --> 44:24.527
Are you with me?

44:48.386 --> 44:50.820
What are you doing
touching the mail?

44:50.855 --> 44:52.656
I'm sorry, ma'am.

44:52.690 --> 44:57.027
I'm looking for Detective Fleming. I
couldn't find him at the station.

44:57.061 --> 44:59.696
- Who are you?
- I'm Detective Hoffman.

44:59.731 --> 45:02.733
- San Francisco PD.
- Frisco?

45:03.635 --> 45:05.002
What are you doing out here?

45:05.036 --> 45:07.305
Is Detective Fleming your son?

45:08.740 --> 45:10.775
- Maybe.
- Does he still live here?

45:10.809 --> 45:13.244
This is the only address
I have for him on file.

45:14.914 --> 45:18.350
Ma'am, I understand he's working
the murder case of Max Laszlo.

45:18.385 --> 45:21.153
I may have some important
information for him.

45:22.756 --> 45:24.790
- Murder?
- Yeah.

45:24.825 --> 45:27.660
- Little Max Laszlo is dead?
- Afraid so.

45:27.694 --> 45:29.128
Oh.

45:29.163 --> 45:32.131
I always figured it'd be
the older one to go first.

45:32.966 --> 45:35.401
- You knew them?
- Of course.

45:36.370 --> 45:38.772
So did they live around here,
then?

45:38.806 --> 45:40.840
They live around here?

45:44.278 --> 45:47.447
That was their house
for over ten years.

45:47.481 --> 45:50.517
Thank you very much
for your time. Thank you.

46:00.461 --> 46:03.830
Hey, Wilson.
Yeah, it's me.

46:43.336 --> 46:45.371
What are you...?

47:04.423 --> 47:07.159
(Muffled police radio)

47:07.193 --> 47:09.327
Copy that. I'll take a look.

47:41.964 --> 47:43.965
(Footsteps outside)

47:53.944 --> 47:56.045
(Door opens)

48:18.837 --> 48:20.804
(Muffled screams)

48:26.511 --> 48:28.579
(Coughs)

48:36.154 --> 48:38.321
(Splutters and chokes)

48:50.801 --> 48:52.468
(Groans)
