03:03.000 --> 03:05.200
Impossible...

03:06.200 --> 03:07.600
Nothing is impossible...

03:09.400 --> 03:10.800
Come on, Mouse...

03:11.600 --> 03:12.400
dig! 

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Dig, Mouse...

03:15.400 --> 03:18.000
Dig, Mouse...

03:46.200 --> 03:49.200
-Jehan.
-Yes, sir?

04:02.000 --> 04:03.400
-Bring out the next three
-Two more..

04:09.400 --> 04:10.800
Hurry up.

04:13.600 --> 04:16.000
- Take two.
- I want Phillipe Gaston.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.800
This is the cell, sir.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.400
Wrong cell. I want Phillipe Gaston,
the one they call "The Mouse".

04:29.600 --> 04:32.600
The Mouse? The Mouse…

04:35.800 --> 04:39.200
The mouse- he left our house.

04:39.800 --> 04:42.800
No mouse today- he ran away.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.600
To ease the pain- he’s down the drain!

04:48.200 --> 04:51.400
-Where is he?!
-I already told you, kind lord!

04:51.400 --> 04:55.400
Hang him. Search every sewer,
every drain!

04:55.400 --> 04:59.200
Find him! Or Captain Marquet
will hang you in his place.

05:00.400 --> 05:03.800
Impossible. Nobody could 
escape through there.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.600
It’s not unlike escaping 
mother’s womb. 

05:17.000 --> 05:19.400
God, what a memory!

06:12.400 --> 06:17.000
Lord, I’ll never pick another pocket 
as long as I live, I swear. 

06:17.000 --> 06:21.400
But here’s the problem- if you won’t let 
me live, how can I prove my good faith to you?

06:22.000 --> 06:25.800
If you’ve heard me, this ledge 
will remain steady as a rock,

06:26.000 --> 06:29.400
and that thing coming at me 
won’t be what I think it is.

06:29.400 --> 06:34.200
If it is, there’ll be no hard feelings, 
of course... but I’ll be very disappointed.

06:38.400 --> 06:39.800
I don’t believe it...

06:44.400 --> 06:46.000
I believe it.

06:51.200 --> 06:54.000
I’m coming.

06:55.200 --> 06:56.800
It’s Phillipe, Lord.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.200
Phillipe.

07:17.800 --> 07:21.600
You won’t regret this, Lord.
I’m a wonderful person.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.600
Hello! What are you 
doing down there?

07:33.600 --> 07:36.000
Get away, get away!

07:36.600 --> 07:38.200
Come there, come there.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.200
There’s disturbing news, Your Grace. 
One of the prisoners has escaped. 

08:45.200 --> 08:49.000
No one ever escapes the 
dungeons of Aquila, Marquet.

08:49.400 --> 08:52.000
The people of the city accept 
that as a historical fact.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.800
- The responsibility is mine.
- Yes.

08:57.400 --> 08:59.800
It would be a miracle...

08:59.800 --> 09:03.000
...if he manages to get through 
the sewage system.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.800
I believe in miracles, Marquet.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.600
It’s part of my job.

09:10.600 --> 09:14.200
At any rate, Your Grace, ‘tis only
one insignificant petty thief.

09:14.400 --> 09:17.600
Great storms announce themselves 
with a simple breeze, Captain,

09:17.800 --> 09:21.600
and a single rebel spark can 
ignite the fires of rebellion. 

09:22.800 --> 09:25.800
If he’s out there, Your Grace, 
I shall find him.

09:26.800 --> 09:27.800
Yes.

09:41.400 --> 09:46.000
Take ten men toward Chanee, 
we ride north to Gabroche.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.800
The name of the man who 
finds this Gaston...

09:49.000 --> 09:56.800
...will be brought to the personal 
attention of the Bishop...

09:52.800 --> 09:56.000
...as will the body of the 
man who lets him get away.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.400
Open the gate!

10:38.600 --> 10:42.200
I know I promised, Lord, 
never again.

10:42.800 --> 10:47.400
But I also know, that you know, 
what a weak-willed person I am.

11:18.400 --> 11:22.600
Come on, Mouse, keep going. 
Not much further.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.600
About 350 miles, that’s all.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.400
A nice hot piece of cabbage, like 
my dear old mother used to make.

11:37.400 --> 11:39.400
Wolf! Wolf.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.000
Please, no wolf.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.400
Extract of lamb.

11:49.400 --> 11:51.200
Where the hell am I?

11:51.200 --> 11:53.800
Hot lamb, with sauce on it.

11:54.400 --> 11:58.800
Maybe some of that green stuff, 
that Bertram used to put on.

12:29.600 --> 12:30.800
- Hello!
- Hello!

12:31.000 --> 12:32.400
- Hello!
- Look up there!

12:34.000 --> 12:36.600
He’s taking daddy’s shoes!

12:36.800 --> 12:38.400
That’s right, my darlings.

13:10.200 --> 13:11.400
Innkeeper.

13:12.600 --> 13:16.400
- A drink of your most expensive!
- Yeah, yeah, show me your money.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.400
Copper, my friend.

13:21.200 --> 13:24.400
And a same for any who 
joins me in a toast!

13:25.200 --> 13:26.400
Let’s hear your toast.

13:28.400 --> 13:31.000
we drink to a special 
man, my friends.

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
Someone who has seen the dungeons of 
Aquila, and lived to tell the tale.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
Then you drink to me, little man.
I’ve seen those dungeons.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.800
A blacksmith, perhaps?

13:42.000 --> 13:47.600
A carpenter? A stonecutter, even? 
But a prisoner, from inside Aquila?

13:47.600 --> 13:49.800
I didn’t say I was a prisoner.

13:54.200 --> 13:59.000
If you’d stuck to the woods, you
may have stood a chance, Gaston.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.200
You’re right.

14:01.600 --> 14:02.600
Get him!

14:25.000 --> 14:26.400
Move, move! Get out of the way!

14:28.600 --> 14:30.200
You, I said move!

15:26.200 --> 15:28.000
I’m so terribly sorry!

15:31.800 --> 15:33.000
Kill him.

15:39.400 --> 15:41.600
May God have mercy on my soul!

15:55.600 --> 15:57.200
You, out.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.200
One of my men told me 
you returned.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.800
I wanted to cut his 
throat for lying...

16:18.000 --> 16:20.600
...because I knew you 
weren’t that stupid.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
- Captain Navarre.
- Francesco.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.400
Captain?

18:00.400 --> 18:03.400
I won’t hurt you, 
I’m a wonderful person.

18:06.200 --> 18:07.800
After him!

18:09.800 --> 18:13.200
Nice ponies, sweet ponies, 
come here… filthy strumpets!

18:34.600 --> 18:35.800
No, no!

18:44.400 --> 18:45.600
No, no, no!

19:19.800 --> 19:22.200
Must be somebody at home. 
I see smoke.

19:24.200 --> 19:27.600
Are you sure you don’t want to ride on, sir?
There’s still plenty of light.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.800
Stop your chattering. 
We’ll spend the night here.

19:31.100 --> 19:32.000
Pitou!

19:39.900 --> 19:41.000
Pitou!

19:45.800 --> 19:47.400
Give me the axe! The axe!

19:47.600 --> 19:52.000
Good evening, sir, my lady. My comrade-in-arms
and I need lodging for the night. 

19:54.600 --> 19:57.600
- No, no place for you here.
- We’ll pay for it, of course.

19:58.800 --> 20:01.600
We are not above compassion 
to those in misery.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.800
You may sleep down 
there, in a barn.

20:10.200 --> 20:11.200
Thank you.

21:01.200 --> 21:02.400
Sir?

21:03.600 --> 21:05.000
Sir, are you there?

21:06.600 --> 21:10.200
If there’s nothing else I
can do, I think I’ll turn in.

21:10.800 --> 21:11.800
- You can take care of my horse.
-All right.

21:12.800 --> 21:15.200
And sleep with one eye open.

21:16.400 --> 21:20.400
And don’t disturb me- I’m liable to take 
your head off before I know it’s you.

21:21.200 --> 21:22.400
All right. Come on, old girl.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Come on.

21:26.200 --> 21:28.800
Stubborn little lady! 
What’s her name?

21:29.600 --> 21:31.800
His name is Goliath.

21:31.800 --> 21:34.600
His name? Pretty name.

21:34.600 --> 21:36.400
Go with him, boy, he didn’t 
mean to hurt your feelings.

21:39.600 --> 21:43.000
Goliath, before we get to 
know each other better...

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
...I feel I should tell you a story 
about a tiny little man named David.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.400
One day.

22:22.200 --> 22:24.000
"Comrade-in-arms"!

22:24.800 --> 22:26.400
"Slave" is more like it.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.600
See to the fire, feed the 
animals, gather the wood...

22:32.600 --> 22:34.200
Look at me, Lord!

22:34.200 --> 22:37.200
I was better off at the 
dungeons of Aquila!

22:37.200 --> 22:41.000
My cellmate was insane, 
and a murderer...

22:41.400 --> 22:43.200
...but he respected me!

22:44.600 --> 22:49.800
He’s a strange one, Navarre. Why did he 
save my life? He wants something from me.

22:50.600 --> 22:52.400
I can see it in his eyes.

22:55.200 --> 22:58.200
Well, whatever it is, 
I’m not going to do it!

22:58.400 --> 23:02.000
I’m still a young man, you know! 
I’ve got prospects!

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
I’m off to find my golden future, 
Captain, so goodbye and good...

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
Hello?

23:34.400 --> 23:36.200
Who do you think is out there?

23:37.400 --> 23:39.600
You better draw your sword, Pierre.

23:40.600 --> 23:44.600
Ah, Louis, you brought 
your crossbow!

23:45.400 --> 23:48.400
We’ll all go back to 
the barn now, all right?

23:48.600 --> 23:50.400
- All right. 
- All right.

23:55.200 --> 23:58.600
Show no mercy, Pierre! 
Take no prisoners!

23:58.600 --> 24:01.000
I’m going to get some help!

24:40.400 --> 24:42.600
Captain, sir, Captain! wolf!

24:43.400 --> 24:45.000
wolf, wolf Sir! 

24:47.000 --> 24:48.800
Sir! Wolf, wolf!

25:28.400 --> 25:30.800
Don’t go out there, 
don’t go out there!

25:31.000 --> 25:35.200
There’s a wolf, a big wolf, the biggest 
wolf you’ve ever seen, and a dead man.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.200
I know.

25:44.200 --> 25:46.200
Miss, please!

25:56.600 --> 25:58.000
Maybe I’m dreaming.

25:59.000 --> 26:03.600
But my eyes are open, which 
means, maybe I’m awake...

26:03.600 --> 26:05.600
...dreaming I’m asleep.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.600
Or, or more likely...

26:07.800 --> 26:11.600
...maybe I’m asleep, 
dreaming I’m awake...

26:11.600 --> 26:13.200
...wondering if I’m dreaming.

26:13.200 --> 26:14.800
You are dreaming.

26:51.000 --> 26:55.400
I’ve not seen what I’ve just seen.
I do not believe what I believe, Lord.

26:55.400 --> 27:00.800
If these are magical or unexplainable matters, 
then I beg you not to make me a part of them.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.400
We’ll stop now.

27:47.400 --> 27:49.400
Not a great day for traveling.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.400
Come on, girl, come on.

27:53.800 --> 27:56.000
I mean, boy. Come on, Goliath. Come on.

27:58.800 --> 28:00.600
Goliath, come on, it’s cold 
out here. Come on.

28:05.200 --> 28:09.000
I can do with a rest myself, 
after last night’s goings on.

28:11.600 --> 28:14.400
The wolf would have kill 
me, it was horrible.

28:15.800 --> 28:19.200
But he tore the farmer’s 
throat out, and left me alone.

28:23.200 --> 28:24.400
And there was more.

28:25.400 --> 28:27.000
There was a woman...

28:27.200 --> 28:31.000
...like fine porcelain, 
with deep blue eyes...

28:31.200 --> 28:33.400
...almost like a bird’s.

28:36.200 --> 28:38.200
And her voice...

28:38.400 --> 28:40.200
...the dulcet tones of an angel.

28:40.400 --> 28:44.400
She spoke? What did she say?

28:44.600 --> 28:49.000
I asked her if I was dreaming, 
and she said I was.

28:50.800 --> 28:54.000
I’m not insane, you must believe 
me when I tell you these things!

28:54.200 --> 28:58.200
No, I believe you. 
I believe in dreams.

28:59.200 --> 29:00.400
I see.

29:02.200 --> 29:05.800
This lady… Did she 
perhaps have a name?

29:06.600 --> 29:08.400
Not that she mentioned, why?

29:11.000 --> 29:13.800
Well, she may wonder 
into my dreams.

29:14.400 --> 29:17.000
Wouldn’t it be nice...

29:17.200 --> 29:21.000
...if I could call her by name 
and pretend we’ve met before?

29:26.600 --> 29:30.200
I’ve waited a long 
time for such a lady.

29:33.600 --> 29:35.000
Sleep.

29:43.200 --> 29:45.800
The bird will warn 
us if anyone comes.

29:51.200 --> 29:53.000
I got to be out of my mind.

29:54.400 --> 29:55.600
Out of my mind.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.600
Open the gates!

31:21.000 --> 31:22.800
Have you found the 
criminal, Gaston?

31:23.800 --> 31:25.600
He’s not in my custody 
at this time.

31:25.600 --> 31:28.200
Then why do you invade my 
garden, unwashed, unshaved?

31:28.200 --> 31:30.000
Do you think to find him here?

31:33.400 --> 31:34.800
Navarre has returned.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.400
Walk with me.

31:54.600 --> 31:59.000
The criminal, Gaston, travels with him. 
My men are combing the woods.

31:59.200 --> 32:00.600
And the hawk?

32:00.800 --> 32:03.600
- Your Grace?
- There must be a hawk.

32:04.200 --> 32:06.200
A spirited hawk.

32:08.200 --> 32:09.800
This one is not to be 
harmed, understood?

32:09.800 --> 32:13.600
You see, the day she dies, a new Captain of 
the Guard will preside at your execution.

32:14.800 --> 32:17.400
We live in difficult times, Marquet.

32:18.800 --> 32:21.600
This famine has prevented people from 
paying their proper tribute to the church.

32:21.600 --> 32:25.200
I raise their taxes, only to be told 
there’s nothing left for me to tax.

32:26.200 --> 32:31.200
Imagine! But last night, the Lord 
Almighty visited me in my sleep. 

32:31.400 --> 32:32.800
He told me...

32:32.800 --> 32:38.000
...that Satan’s messenger is traveling 
amongst us. And his name...

32:38.800 --> 32:41.000
...is Etienne of Navarre.

32:42.600 --> 32:43.600
Go.

32:44.400 --> 32:47.200
To break faith with me is 
to break faith with Him.

32:56.200 --> 32:59.000
- Get me Cezar!
- Yes, Your Grace.

33:24.600 --> 33:28.800
This sword has been in my 
family for five generations.

33:28.800 --> 33:32.600
It has never known 
defeat, until now.

33:33.800 --> 33:37.000
This jewel represents 
my family name.

33:37.000 --> 33:41.000
This one is our alliance with 
the Holy Church in Rome.

33:41.200 --> 33:44.600
This one… was my father’s...

33:45.600 --> 33:47.000
...from the Crusades.

33:47.800 --> 33:50.000
And this...

33:50.200 --> 33:52.400
Sir, you don’t think that I took that one...

33:53.000 --> 33:54.600
This is mine to fill.

33:56.400 --> 34:00.000
Each generation is called 
upon to follow its quest.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
And what is your quest?

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
I must kill a man.

34:06.200 --> 34:09.400
Tell me, does this walking 
corpse have a name?

34:12.800 --> 34:14.600
His Grace...

34:14.800 --> 34:16.800
...the Bishop of Aquila.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.400
The Bishop... I see.

34:23.800 --> 34:26.199
Well, then you have much to do.

34:26.199 --> 34:28.800
And I’ve already been 
enough of a burden to you.

34:29.800 --> 34:32.600
I do hope our paths
cross again someday.

34:32.800 --> 34:34.800
I need you to guide 
me into the city.

34:34.800 --> 34:36.600
Not for the life of my mother !

34:36.600 --> 34:38.600
...Even if I knew who she was..

34:38.800 --> 34:40.800
You’re the only one who has 
ever escaped from there.

34:40.800 --> 34:45.800
It was chance, pure chance, 
a miracle!

34:45.800 --> 34:48.000
I fell down a hole 
and followed my nose.

34:51.199 --> 34:56.000
I have waited almost two 
years for a sign from God.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.200
So when I heard the 
warning bells of Aquila...

34:59.400 --> 35:04.600
...I knew the moment of my destiny has 
come. You will be my guiding angel.

35:04.600 --> 35:05.600
Me?!

35:07.600 --> 35:12.600
Sir, the truth is, I talk to God all the time, 
and no offense, but he never mentioned you.

35:12.800 --> 35:14.200
No?

35:15.200 --> 35:17.800
There are strange forces 
at work in your life.

35:18.600 --> 35:20.400
Magical ones that surround you.

35:21.600 --> 35:24.000
I don’t understand them, 
but they frighten me.

35:25.600 --> 35:27.200
You have given me my life.

35:27.800 --> 35:30.400
The truth is, I can never repay you.

35:30.400 --> 35:32.800
I have no honor, and never will have.

35:34.400 --> 35:38.000
I don’t think that you’d kill 
me for being what I am.

35:39.800 --> 35:44.200
But, better that then 
to return to Aquila.

35:57.200 --> 35:59.600
I’ll gather some 
wood for the fire.

36:17.600 --> 36:19.200
- Got you.
- Miss?

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
My lady, up here.

36:24.800 --> 36:25.600
Oh, damn.

36:26.200 --> 36:27.600
Do you remember me?

36:28.600 --> 36:30.000
What are you doing up there?

36:30.400 --> 36:34.000
What am I doing? Well, yes, 
you might ask that.

36:35.200 --> 36:36.600
The Bishop’s guards.

36:36.800 --> 36:39.000
A dozen of them, 
we had a terrible fight.

36:39.200 --> 36:42.000
- Why didn’t they kill you.
- Why didn’t they?..

36:42.600 --> 36:46.200
It’s a good question, 
I asked them that myself.

36:46.400 --> 36:48.600
- And?..
- And?

36:48.600 --> 36:50.600
And what did they say?

36:50.800 --> 36:55.400
They said that... that they prefer 
to leave that honor to the Bishop.

36:57.200 --> 36:59.000
They’re coming back.

36:59.200 --> 37:02.400
- They are, are they?
- Please, my lady?

37:02.400 --> 37:06.000
A giant owl examined me 
closely not one minute ago.

37:09.600 --> 37:10.600
Please?

37:14.600 --> 37:15.800
Please?

37:23.400 --> 37:25.000
You’re very kind.

37:35.800 --> 37:36.800
Listen,..

37:38.600 --> 37:43.600
Thank you very much, my lady. Tell the 
Captain he ties a wicked knot!

37:46.400 --> 37:47.800
He’s going to kill me.

37:58.400 --> 37:59.800
Good morning!

38:01.400 --> 38:03.600
Let’s go find Phillipe.

38:15.400 --> 38:16.600
Well, well.

38:17.600 --> 38:20.000
Long way from the 
sewers, little rat.

38:21.400 --> 38:23.400
This time, the drinks are on me.

38:24.600 --> 38:27.600
- Where is Navarre?
- Navarre? Navarre?

38:28.400 --> 38:31.000
Oh, yes, yes, big man, 
black horse.

38:31.800 --> 38:34.400
I saw him riding 
south, toward Aquila.

38:35.600 --> 38:37.200
Then we ride north, sir.

38:37.400 --> 38:41.400
It’s not polite to assume that somebody 
is a liar when you’ve only just met him.

38:41.600 --> 38:44.000
Yet you knew we would.

38:45.600 --> 38:49.200
We ride south. Toward Aquila.

38:49.200 --> 38:51.600
I told the truth, Lord!

38:51.800 --> 38:55.600
How can I learn any moral lessons, 
when you keep confusing me like this?

40:11.600 --> 40:13.000
Hawke!

40:15.400 --> 40:16.600
No.

41:11.200 --> 41:13.800
Easy, you’ll be all right.

41:22.400 --> 41:25.600
Get me a piece of 
cloth from my saddlebag!

41:26.400 --> 41:29.600
Easy, don’t be afraid, 
it’s all right, it’s all right.

41:36.600 --> 41:37.600
Thanks.

41:38.800 --> 41:42.200
You’ll be all right. 
You will be fine.

41:43.200 --> 41:45.200
You’ll live.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Take her, find help.

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
- Me, sir?
- You’re the only one I have.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.400
- But sir, the hawk is done for.
- Don’t you say that!

41:58.800 --> 42:02.000
Follow this road. You’ll find 
a ruined castle.

42:02.000 --> 42:06.400
There’s a monk named Imperious. Give 
him the hawk. He will know what to do.

42:06.600 --> 42:08.800
- Sir, I don’t think you understand...
- Get on my horse!

42:08.800 --> 42:11.400
You’re the only one who can ride him.

42:11.400 --> 42:14.800
You will do as I tell you! 
Get on my horse, now!

42:23.800 --> 42:25.200
Careful.

42:28.400 --> 42:29.600
And know this...

42:29.600 --> 42:33.000
if you fail, I will follow 
you the length of my days.

42:33.600 --> 42:35.000
And I will find you.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
Go.

42:40.200 --> 42:41.200
Come on, go.

43:13.000 --> 43:16.800
There it is, see? The castle. 
We’ll be there soon.

43:19.600 --> 43:22.800
Ah! Well, well, that’s 
gratitude for you!

43:23.000 --> 43:28.200
All right, let this Imperious watch you die. 
I’ve got my own life to look after!

43:39.200 --> 43:40.400
Hello!

43:48.400 --> 43:49.200
Hello... 

43:51.600 --> 43:53.200
up there!

43:53.800 --> 43:55.400
For peace sake, hello!

43:56.200 --> 43:58.600
Hello, hello!

43:59.200 --> 44:01.400
What do you want down there?

44:03.000 --> 44:07.800
- I was told to bring you this bird. It’s been wounded.
- Oh, good shot!

44:07.800 --> 44:11.600
- Bring her in, we’ll dine together.
- We can’t eat this bird.

44:11.800 --> 44:15.200
Oh, why not... Oh, God, is 
it lent again already?!

44:16.000 --> 44:21.400
This is no ordinary hawk, father. 
It belongs to a man named Navarre.

44:21.600 --> 44:25.400
Mother of God! Bring her in, 
bring her in!

44:31.400 --> 44:32.400
Stay. 

44:33.400 --> 44:34.600
Good bird.

44:36.200 --> 44:38.800
Up here, boy! Hurry.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
Depressa!

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Hurry! Here, up here.

44:48.600 --> 44:50.000
This way.

44:51.600 --> 44:55.600
Now, careful. Walk on 
the left side.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
There.

45:18.200 --> 45:19.600
Gently...

45:23.200 --> 45:24.200
gently.

45:34.800 --> 45:36.200
Now, leave us.

45:36.400 --> 45:38.600
- Can I help?
- Get out, boy.

45:48.400 --> 45:49.600
Don’t be frightened.

45:50.600 --> 45:52.200
Navarre was right.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
I know what to do.

45:59.200 --> 46:01.200
We must wait a little.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Now, then, where is it? Oh, yes, there...

46:20.800 --> 46:22.800
Now, what we’re going to need?

46:22.800 --> 46:27.600
Some tarragon, rosemary, 
wood for the fire...

46:42.200 --> 46:44.800
It’s late. Time, I need time.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.800
Now, there, that’s it...

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
Navarre, is he?..

47:05.800 --> 47:07.000
He’s fine.

47:08.600 --> 47:10.400
he’s just fine, my lady.

47:13.000 --> 47:16.600
There was a terrible battle. 
Navarre fought like a lion.

47:20.200 --> 47:21.200
The hawk...

47:23.000 --> 47:25.600
The hawk was struck.

47:28.200 --> 47:30.800
- You know that, don’t you?
- Yes.

47:37.000 --> 47:38.200
Are you flesh?

47:39.600 --> 47:41.400
or are you spirit??

47:44.400 --> 47:46.000
I am sorrow.

47:53.800 --> 47:55.000
How?..

48:15.600 --> 48:17.200
Now, get out.

48:18.400 --> 48:19.400
Get out.

48:20.400 --> 48:22.600
This time, stay out!

49:30.400 --> 49:33.000
Forgive me, Your Grace. 
Cezar has arrived.

50:08.800 --> 50:10.400
It’s him, isn’t it?

50:11.000 --> 50:14.600
- The wolf, somehow, it’s him.
- Drink, forget!

50:14.800 --> 50:17.600
An hour ago you were drunk, 
and you remembered.

50:18.400 --> 50:21.400
- What do they call you, boy?
- Phillipe Gaston.

50:25.200 --> 50:28.200
Her name is Isabeau D’Anjou.

50:28.200 --> 50:32.600
Her father was the count D’Anjou, 
an ill-tempered fellow.

50:32.600 --> 50:35.800
He found his death slaying 
Saracens in Antioch.

50:36.800 --> 50:42.400
She came to live, with her cousin 
I think it was, in Aquila.

50:43.400 --> 50:48.400
I shall never forget the first time 
I saw her. It was like looking at...

50:48.400 --> 50:49.800
The face of love.

50:50.800 --> 50:53.000
Ah, you too?

50:53.000 --> 50:57.000
Well, I suppose we were all in 
love with her in different ways.

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
Even His Grace, the Bishop, 
couldn’t think of nothing else.

51:00.000 --> 51:01.400
The Bishop loved her?!

51:01.400 --> 51:06.000
As near as that evil 
man could come to it. 

51:06.000 --> 51:10.200
His passion was a sort of madness.
He was a man possessed!

51:10.200 --> 51:13.400
But Isabeau sensed his wickedness, 
and she shrank from him.

51:13.400 --> 51:17.600
She sent back all his letters 
and left his poems unread.

51:17.800 --> 51:20.600
Her heart was already 
lost, you see...

51:20.800 --> 51:23.200
...to the Captain of the Guard.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Etienne Navarre!

51:27.000 --> 51:29.200
The Bishop knew nothing 
about their love.

51:29.200 --> 51:33.400
But every day he saw it grow 
stronger and deeper and richer.

51:34.800 --> 51:35.800
Until...

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
Until?

51:54.800 --> 51:56.200
They were betrayed.

51:58.800 --> 52:03.400
They shared the same confessor, 
a weak, foolish priest. 

52:03.400 --> 52:09.000
On one day, on a drunken confession to 
his superior, he committed a mortal sin.

52:09.600 --> 52:13.200
He revealed the lovers’ secret 
vows to the Bishop.

52:14.800 --> 52:17.600
The old fool didn’t realize 
what he had done at first...

52:17.800 --> 52:20.200
...or the terrible revenge 
the Bishop would exact.

52:20.200 --> 52:24.600
His Grace seemed to go mad, he lost 
both his sanctity and his reason.

52:24.600 --> 52:29.600
He swore, that if he could not 
have her, no man would.

52:29.800 --> 52:35.400
So, Navarre and Isabeau 
fled from Aquila.

52:36.000 --> 52:41.800
The Bishop followed, ever more ardent, 
ever more persistent than a hound.

52:42.600 --> 52:45.600
An evil man, a powerful 
man, hated and feared;

52:45.800 --> 52:48.000
Rejected even by Rome itself.

52:49.000 --> 52:52.200
He called upon the 
powers of darkness...

52:52.200 --> 52:55.600
...for the means to 
damn the lovers.

52:55.800 --> 53:01.600
In his fury and frustration, 
he struck a dreadful bargain...

53:03.800 --> 53:05.800
...with the Evil One

53:09.200 --> 53:11.600
The dark powers of hell...

53:11.800 --> 53:15.800
...spat up a terrible curse, 
and you have seen it working.

53:16.400 --> 53:21.600
By day, Isabeau is the beautiful 
bird you brought to me.

53:21.600 --> 53:25.400
And by night, as you 
have already guessed...

53:26.400 --> 53:28.800
...the voice of the 
wolf that we hear...

53:30.000 --> 53:33.200
...is the cry of Navarre.

53:33.200 --> 53:37.800
Poor dumb creatures, with no memory of 
the half-life of their human existence

53:37.800 --> 53:40.200
never touching in the flesh.

53:40.200 --> 53:44.600
Only the anguish of a split 
second at sunrise and sunset...

53:44.600 --> 53:47.600
...when they can almost touch...

53:48.200 --> 53:50.000
...but not.

53:50.400 --> 53:54.800
always together...
eternally apart...

53:55.000 --> 54:00.400
As long as the sun rises and sets, 
as long as there is day and night

54:01.400 --> 54:04.800
and for as long as 
they both shall live.

54:09.000 --> 54:13.400
You have stumbled onto a 
tragic story, Phillipe Gaston.

54:14.400 --> 54:17.400
And now, whether 
you like it or not...

54:17.400 --> 54:21.200
...you are lost in it, 
with the rest of us.

54:51.600 --> 54:52.800
Useless.

54:53.200 --> 54:54.400
All of them.

54:54.800 --> 54:56.800
My traps are full.

54:57.000 --> 55:02.400
I can’t kill every wolf that lives. Since 
the plague there are more wolves then men.

55:03.800 --> 55:06.000
And there is a woman.

55:06.000 --> 55:07.000
Your Grace?

55:09.600 --> 55:11.600
A beautiful woman...

55:13.600 --> 55:17.800
...with alabaster skin, and 
the eyes of a dove.

55:21.400 --> 55:25.400
She travels by night, only by 
night. Her sun is the moon.

55:25.600 --> 55:27.600
And her name is...

55:31.000 --> 55:32.800
...Isabeau.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.200
Find her, and you 
find the wolf.

55:38.400 --> 55:39.800
The wolf I want.

55:40.800 --> 55:42.200
The wolf who...

55:44.400 --> 55:45.800
...loves her.

55:48.800 --> 55:50.600
A black wolf.

55:55.400 --> 55:56.800
Isabeau.

56:14.000 --> 56:14.800
Don’t, don’t.

56:16.800 --> 56:18.800
You might start bleeding again.

56:25.400 --> 56:26.800
Tell me your name.

56:28.200 --> 56:31.000
Most people call me 
Phillipe "The Mouse"

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
You travel with him, don’t you?

56:35.400 --> 56:36.400
Yes.

56:52.600 --> 56:55.600
"You must save this hawk", 
he said.

56:55.800 --> 57:01.200
"For she is my life, my last 
and best reason for living".

57:05.400 --> 57:07.200
And then he said:

57:08.600 --> 57:12.400
"One day we will know such happiness...

57:12.400 --> 57:16.000
... as two people dream 
of, but never do".

57:22.800 --> 57:24.600
He said that?

57:26.400 --> 57:28.600
I swear it on my life.

57:55.300 --> 57:57.900
- Does she know?
- What?

57:58.900 --> 58:01.700
That you are the priest 
that betrayed them.

58:01.700 --> 58:04.700
The Lord has declared 
an end to it at last.

58:04.700 --> 58:08.100
He has given me the knowledge 
to undo what I have done. 

58:08.300 --> 58:11.900
After two years, he has brought 
us back together again.

58:13.300 --> 58:15.700
Make yourself clear, if you can.

58:17.500 --> 58:20.900
I have found a way 
to break the curse...

58:20.900 --> 58:23.900
...and a time for Navarre 
to confront the Bishop...

58:23.900 --> 58:25.900
...and to begin his 
own true life again.

58:26.100 --> 58:29.900
He intends to confront the Bishop, to kill 
him with the sword of his ancestors.

58:30.100 --> 58:34.300
No, he mustn’t do that! He can’t! If he kills 
the Bishop, the curse can never be broken!

58:37.300 --> 58:40.100
Look after Isabeau, boy! 
Go, quickly!

58:47.700 --> 58:51.500
Open up the door, in the name of 
His Holiness the Bishop of Aquila!

58:51.500 --> 58:56.300
Ah, away with you! This is a 
house of God, not a brothel!

58:56.300 --> 58:58.300
I said, open up, in the 
name of the Bishop!

58:58.500 --> 59:03.100
I’ve met the Bishop, you blasphemous 
lout! And you look nothing like him!

59:03.700 --> 59:05.500
- Break it in!
- Yes, sir.

59:07.300 --> 59:08.900
Left side, left side.

59:14.700 --> 59:15.900
My lady!

59:19.100 --> 59:20.900
My lady.

59:21.700 --> 59:22.700
Come with me.

59:22.900 --> 59:24.900
- What is it?
- Don’t talk, come with me.

59:29.100 --> 59:30.300
Sorry!

59:30.700 --> 59:32.900
I am a monk, not an architect!

59:41.900 --> 59:43.300
Move it in here!

59:47.500 --> 59:49.100
In here, my lady.

59:55.500 --> 59:58.300
This way, my son, straight 
to the big main doors.

59:59.100 --> 01:00:00.300
And don’t forget...

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:10.100
walk on the left side.

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:21.500
Careful...

01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:31.100
Go back, back inside.

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:46.700
- I Got it!
- You got it!

01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:50.900
My bots!

01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:08.500
- Phillipe, it’s me they’re after!
- Don’t flatter yourself.

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:45.700
Hold me!

01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:48.300
I’m slipping!

01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:50.900
No!!!

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:43.500
You!

01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:45.900
- Where is the woman?
- She flew away!

01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:48.500
- Where is she?!
- God’s truth, she flew away!

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:11.900
It always pays to say the truth, my Lord.

01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:14.900
Thank you. I see that now.

01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:30.500
I thought you might have 
been dead, old man.

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:32.900
There were times I wanted 
to kill you myself.

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:37.700
But I’m very grateful... for this.

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:43.100
It is I who should be grateful 
to have the chance ...

01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:48.900
...to redeem myself, and to save 
you and Isabeau.

01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:53.900
Because the Lord has told me, 
how the curse may be broken.

01:03:57.300 --> 01:04:00.500
You have betrayed us 
once, I warn you.

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:06.500
Three days hence, the Bishop will 
hear confessions from the clergy...

01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:08.900
...in the cathedral in Aquila.

01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:13.900
All you have to do is to confront him, 
both of you, as man and woman...

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:15.900
...in the flesh...

01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:18.900
...and the curse will 
be confounded...

01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:22.500
...broken. And both of 
you will be free!

01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:28.300
- Impossible.
- As long as there is night and day, no.

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:33.900
But three days hence, in Aquila, 
there will be a day without a night...

01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:35.500
...and a night without a day.

01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:40.900
Go back inside, old man, 
go back to your drink.

01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:43.300
 You think that I’m drunk?!

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:45.700
I swear to you!

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:48.300
God has shown me!

01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:50.900
He has forgiven me!

01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:53.900
He hasn’t forgiven you.

01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:57.500
He’s made you mad.

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:05.100
Sir, sir!

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:15.700
It’s all right. Sir, sir!

01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:24.900
How’s your shoulder?

01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:30.500
- I’m in your debt.
- Me? Sir, no, no, not at all.

01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:34.700
She wanted me to 
deliver a message....

01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:37.500
...to say, that she still has 
hope, faith in you..

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:44.500
- You’re free to go.
- I know that, sir.

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:46.700
- Do as you like.
- Yes, sir

01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:52.500
And you and Ladyhawke will be 
going on to Aquila?

01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:56.500
- Ladyhawke? 
- Yes.

01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:03.300
Well, it just so happens, I’m headed 
in that general direction myself.

01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:05.700
Really?

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:13.100
Than you better grab your 
things, I’m leaving.

01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:14.500
Right.

01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:21.100
Ladyhawke.

01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:27.300
Imperious, I’m leaving with 
the Captain, follow us.

01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:40.100
But if the old man is right 
about breaking the curse...

01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:44.700
...if you and Isabeau could face the 
Bishop together as man and woman...

01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:49.700
You will not mention this again. 
Not to me and not to her.

01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:51.100
Understood?

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:56.900
Abraham, will you 
get a move on!

01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:03.300
It looks like a big one, Captain. 
We’re gonna get soaked.

01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:06.700
Find shelter.

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.900
- The sun is going down.
- How can you tell?

01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:14.500
After so many sunsets?

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:18.300
ake care of Ladyhawke.

01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:28.700
Tell her I love her.

01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:46.100
Are you hungry?

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:51.500
Do you understand me, Ladyhawke?

01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:58.900
You know, it was my favorite 
thing for dinner- hawk.

01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:01.500
I’ve eaten thousands of them. 
I used to kill one every night. 

01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:09.100
Serves me right for getting 
involved in this nightmare.

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:11.700
Nightmare? Daymare...

01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:16.500
And then "a night without day, 
a day without night..."

01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:18.500
What’s that supposed to mean?

01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:22.100
Makes about as much sense 
as the rest of it.

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:25.700
Oh oh. The sun sets.

01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:29.100
I’ll wait outside.

01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:38.500
Oh... Hold on for a minute.

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:11.700
I can’t vouch for the fit.

01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:17.100
Take you time, my lady.

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:01.500
Miss?

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:06.300
My lady?

01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:08.700
I’m coming in!

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:12.500
Miss?

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:18.500
Miss?

01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:24.900
It’s me, remember?

01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:30.900
-You?
-Yeah.

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:33.500
Thank you.

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:40.300
- How is he?
- He’s alive, like you.

01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:43.700
He’s full of hope, like you.

01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:46.300
He left you in my charge.

01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:53.300
He said, "tell her that we speak as one, and 
she will follow your instructions as my own".

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:55.500
Really?

01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:58.100
No, don’t swear.

01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:04.700
Good evening, Goliath.

01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:12.500
He’s taking us back 
to Aquila, isn’t he?

01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:20.500
Well, what do you instruct?

01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:26.300
I instruct you to sit 
by a warm fire...

01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:29.100
...to drink a cup of sweet wine...

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:33.500
...and to listen to bright 
music cheerfully played.

01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:35.500
Perhaps even dance.

01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:43.300
Shall we, my lady? Dance?

01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:47.700
- Now?
- Practice.

01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:23.300
Oh... oh, may. It has been 
a long time, Phillipe.

01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:26.700
I’ll have my cup of 
sweet wine now.

01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:28.300
All right.

01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:42.300
So, you intend to by my protector 
as well, eh? I’m flattered.

01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:46.100
Actually, the truth is, 
he’ll kill me if I lose it.

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:53.700
I had to steel your dress.

01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:57.100
You stole my dress?

01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:07.100
Isabeau. Isabeau!

01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:09.500
Isabeau? Isabeau...

01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:12.100
- Get inside!
- No!

01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:19.100
If you lay one hand on her, you will 
find it on the ground next to your head!

01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:22.900
- Now, ride on!
- Easy, little man, you’re frightening me.

01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:25.100
Are you deft?! Ride on!

01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:33.500
Turn around, and you’re dead!

01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:42.100
What a terrible night.

01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:48.700
Isabeau!

01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:05.700
Is... Isabeau! He’ll kill me.

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:39.300
Show yourself, coward!

01:15:56.700 --> 01:15:57.900
My beautiful.

01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:12.300
-Navarre...
-A black wolf...

01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:46.300
Will you get on, Abraham?

01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:50.300
Go faster, it’s going 
to snow soon.

01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:27.700
-Good morning.

01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:32.900
-Oh... Good morning
-You look a little pale, 
I got you something to eat.

01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:35.700
What a night...

01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:39.500
What happened?

01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:43.300
Ah... Oh, nothing I 
couldn’t handle, Captain.

01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:04.300
It’s a good little 
hawk, nice bird.

01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:07.900
Go on now, go to your master.

01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:11.100
- Go on, Ladyhawke.
- Last night...

01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:12.500
Captain?

01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:14.700
- Tell me about it.
- What’s to tell?

01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:16.300
Go on now, go on, go...

01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:20.700
- We ran in a bit of trouble on the way to an inn.
- You took Isabeau to an inn?!

01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:25.100
First we had to go to a stable.
Fly to your master, fly to the one you love.

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:27.700
- What did you do in a stable? 
- We changed clothes.

01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:28.900
What!?

01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:31.100
- Not together, of course! 
- Did you leave her alone?!

01:18:31.300 --> 01:18:33.300
- No!
- So you did change together!..

01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:34.900
No, no, no! Take her, take her.

01:18:46.300 --> 01:18:48.900
She is the most wonderful 
woman that ever lived...

01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:52.300
and I can’t say I haven’t 
had my fantasies

01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:55.300
but the truth is, all she 
did was talk about you.

01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:06.900
Every moment you spend with her...

01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:08.700
...I envy you..

01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:20.100
But you can tell me.

01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:23.100
Tell me everything she said.

01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:29.500
And I warn you, I will know 
if the words are hers.

01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:46.100
She was sad at first.

01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:51.300
She talked about the day you 
met, and she cursed it.

01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:58.300
But then...

01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:01.700
...I saw her remember how 
happy you were together...

01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:03.700
...before the Bishop’s curse.

01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:06.500
And her eyes glowed.

01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:09.900
No, she glowed.

01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:14.700
She loves you more than life, 
Captain. She’s had to.

01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:21.900
Did you know that hawks and 
wolves mate for life?

01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:28.500
Yeah... The Bishop didn’t 
even leave us that. 

01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:31.100
Not even that.

01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:12.500
On your way to kill His Grace?

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:14.300
Why won’t you listen to me?

01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:16.900
In two days time...

01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:20.900
...you can face the Bishop in the 
cathedral with Isabeau by your side...

01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:23.100
...and break the curse.

01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:26.100
I will be in Aquila tomorrow.

01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:30.500
And in one way or another, there 
will finally be an end to it.

01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:34.300
One day more or less, 
what can it matter?

01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:35.300
You too?

01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:38.100
I warned you.

01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:42.500
- Stay here then with the old man.
- No, I’m going with you.

01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:45.100
How can you get inside 
the cathedral without me?

01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:47.500
I will get in without your help.

01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:03.700
Thank you for trying, Phillipe,
and for standing up for the truth.

01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:06.700
I should have known better.

01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:11.100
Every happy moment in my 
life has come from lying.

01:22:57.100 --> 01:22:59.100
There you are, little Mouse.

01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:02.300
Where is my knife?

01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:06.300
- Isabeau?
- I just had it, now what have I done with it?

01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:09.500
Isabeau, this may be 
our last evening together.

01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:18.100
- Why?
- I didn’t want to tell you until I believed.

01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:19.700
I mean, really believed.

01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:25.300
- Really believed what, Phillipe?
- I think we can break the curse.

01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:30.900
We have a plan.

01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:37.300
- You and Navarre?
- No.

01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:50.900
Must you keep punching 
me in the liver?!

01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:57.500
Imperious...

01:23:57.900 --> 01:24:00.900
...this hole isn’t big 
enough for the two of us.

01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:03.500
Well, let’s hope it’s 
big enough for the wolf.

01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:24.300
Ah! What are you doing?!

01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:30.100
When you kneel before the altar, 
how do you get up again?

01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:32.100
You sacrilegious young imp!

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:34.500
you... Push, blast yah! 
Come on, again! And again!

01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:45.500
He’s coming, he’s coming! 
Ah! Phillipe!!!

01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:51.900
My lady, my lady! We are 
just covering the trap.

01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:54.100
All right, hurry!

01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:17.500
He’s coming across the 
ice. 

01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:29.900
-Wait, my lady!
-Phillipe, help me!

01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:36.700
The ice will break, 
lie down, lie down!

01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:40.500
He can’t get out!

01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:51.500
Wait!

01:25:52.700 --> 01:25:54.300
Wait, my lady!

01:25:55.900 --> 01:25:58.300
Oh, God, Phillipe, I can’t...

01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:00.900
I’m coming.

01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:05.700
Hurry, we’ll lose him!

01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:11.100
He’s heavy.

01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:16.100
He’s slipping.

01:26:20.700 --> 01:26:23.100
-Hold him!
-Be careful!

01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:38.300
Phillipe!

01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:49.700
Push, push, push! 

01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:54.900
It’s all right.

01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:04.100
Hold on!

01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:06.700
Hold on, hold on, boy!

01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:33.900
We must live, father.

01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:37.100
As human beings.

01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:41.900
Our lives are in your hands now.

01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:41.700
Tell me one thing. Where is 
my father’s sword?

01:31:41.900 --> 01:31:42.900
It’s gone.

01:31:43.300 --> 01:31:46.100
It fell through the ice last 
night, crossing the river.

01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:47.300
Damn you!

01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:51.700
- That sword was the last bit of honor I possessed!
- There is no mission of honor now!

01:31:52.700 --> 01:31:57.100
The jewel you wished to place in the sword has become 
nothing but the symbol of your meaningless death!

01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:02.500
But there is a chance for life 
now, a new life with her!

01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:07.500
- I needed that sword to kill the Bishop!
- Navarre, listen to him!

01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:09.100
-Damn you!

01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:12.700
Go ahead, kill yourself, kill her too! You never 
cared about her as much as yourself anyway!

01:32:24.300 --> 01:32:25.500
What is that?

01:32:26.100 --> 01:32:29.100
It happened last night, 
when he saved your life!

01:32:36.700 --> 01:32:37.900
Forgive me.

01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:53.500
I’ll show you idiots 
how to cage a wolf.

01:33:11.900 --> 01:33:15.500
Remember, the groove 
inside the north wall.

01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:32.900
All right, the groove inside the north wall...
We have come a full circle, Lord.

01:33:34.500 --> 01:33:37.700
I would like to think there is some 
higher meaning in all of this.

01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:40.900
It certainly would reflect well on you.

01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:49.400
Go on here, come on...

01:33:54.100 --> 01:33:56.100
Hold! What have we here, holy father?

01:33:56.500 --> 01:33:58.500
A surprise gift, eh... my son,...

01:33:58.900 --> 01:34:02.300
...to His Grace the Bishop, from...

01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:04.700
From the people of my parish.

01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:09.900
A fine pelt for his wall.

01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:14.500
And what have we here?

01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:24.700
I’ve never had the pleasure 
of killing a wolf before.

01:34:26.300 --> 01:34:29.300
How strange, it’s exactly 
what the Bishop said.

01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:34.300
I’m sure he will understand you 
depriving him of that pleasure.

01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:36.300
he’s a very forgiving sort of man.

01:34:42.300 --> 01:34:43.900
Very well, pass on.

01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:49.500
Wisdom is beyond price, my son.
Be grateful that you have it.

01:34:56.700 --> 01:34:58.700
Clear the post!

01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:31.500
It should be soon now, 
once the clouds break.

01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:34.500
It’s day, old man.

01:36:34.700 --> 01:36:37.700
Like it was yesterday, like 
it will be tomorrow.

01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:37.900
Oh, no... Damn.

01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:06.900
- What’s the matter?
- Rats!

01:38:07.100 --> 01:38:09.500
Rats?! Here?!

01:38:11.900 --> 01:38:13.300
Scandalous.

01:38:54.100 --> 01:38:55.700
It’s too late.

01:38:55.700 --> 01:38:59.500
he mass will be over soon. 
I can’t wait for you now.

01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:03.900
If Phillipe has done his job, I can 
kill the Bishop now or never.

01:39:03.900 --> 01:39:07.300
No, Etienne, this chance 
will never come again!

01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:09.300
You’re right.

01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:14.300
If the service ends peacefully...

01:39:14.300 --> 01:39:17.500
...the cathedral bells begin to toll...

01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:19.700
...and you will know I have failed.

01:39:22.900 --> 01:39:24.700
But Isabeau?...

01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:37.500
I... beg you- take her life...

01:39:40.300 --> 01:39:42.500
quick and painless.

01:39:42.700 --> 01:39:44.300
I can’t do that!

01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:47.300
Yes you can! I beg you.

01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:51.500
The cruelty would be to damn her to a half-life 
like this, that is not what she wants.

01:39:53.700 --> 01:39:55.700
I couldn’t do it.

01:39:57.300 --> 01:40:01.300
Have you ever considered, that this 
is what God intended all along?

01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:44.500
As the one who was once your Captain...

01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:49.700
...and through God’s grace will be 
once again, I ask you to let me pass.

01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:53.700
Captain Navarre...

01:40:53.700 --> 01:40:54.900
...I have my orders.

01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:11.500
Come on, open! 

01:41:19.700 --> 01:41:20.700
Come on...

01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:23.700
Come on!01:41:23

01:42:25.700 --> 01:42:27.700
Navarre !!!

01:43:35.900 --> 01:43:37.300
Oh, thank you, Lord.

01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:11.700
A night without a day...

01:45:13.900 --> 01:45:15.900
and a day without a night...

01:45:26.900 --> 01:45:30.900
Lord, go with him, be with him.

01:45:37.300 --> 01:45:39.700
-Imperious, wait!
-Stop!

01:46:00.500 --> 01:46:01.900
You’re dead.

01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:47.700
Stop!!!

01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:03.900
Imperious... make it quick.

01:47:05.700 --> 01:47:07.300
God, forgive me.

01:49:41.100 --> 01:49:42.700
But kill me, Navarre...

01:49:43.900 --> 01:49:46.100
...and the curse will 
go on forever.

01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:48.900
You must think of Isabeau.

01:49:52.900 --> 01:49:54.300
Isabeau...

01:49:55.300 --> 01:49:56.500
...is dead.

01:49:59.900 --> 01:50:01.500
Damn you.

01:50:03.900 --> 01:50:06.900
- Damn you to hell.
- Navarre?

01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:42.100
Look!

01:50:43.300 --> 01:50:44.900
Look at her!

01:50:55.100 --> 01:50:56.700
Look at me.

01:51:21.900 --> 01:51:23.100
Now, look at us. 

01:51:27.700 --> 01:51:29.500
Look at us!

01:51:34.900 --> 01:51:37.500
It’s over. It’s broken.

01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:35.500
No man shall!..

01:53:36.900 --> 01:53:37.700
Navarre!

01:54:47.700 --> 01:54:49.900
Oh, my God!

01:55:02.700 --> 01:55:04.700
Isabeau...

01:55:08.100 --> 01:55:09.500
You’ve cut your hair.

01:55:11.700 --> 01:55:12.900
I love you...

01:55:14.300 --> 01:55:16.900
- Isabeau.
- Navarre.

01:55:30.500 --> 01:55:31.700
You two!

01:55:34.700 --> 01:55:35.700
Come here.

01:55:48.700 --> 01:55:50.300
May God’s blessings...

01:55:51.300 --> 01:55:55.100
...be with you both, from 
this day forward.

01:55:55.100 --> 01:55:58.900
I bless the day he brought 
you back to us, father.

01:55:58.900 --> 01:56:01.700
And you. And you...

01:56:07.300 --> 01:56:10.500
You’re the truest 
friend we could ever have.

01:56:15.100 --> 01:56:16.700
Thank you.

01:56:27.300 --> 01:56:32.700
I fully intend to meet you at the pearly gates, 
little thief. Don’t you dare disappoint me!

01:56:33.500 --> 01:56:37.100
I’ll meet you there, father. 
Even if I’d have to pick the lock.

01:56:55.700 --> 01:56:57.100
-Isabeau!
-I love you, I love you!..
