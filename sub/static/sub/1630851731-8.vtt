There's a bootlegging operation
up there.

20:26.459 --> 20:28.726
- Hmm... You know,
I'd assume to think

20:28.728 --> 20:31.128
That alessandro
was pretty handy.

20:31.197 --> 20:34.331
- What are you doing here?
Women never come to the lot.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.533
- We are detectives.
Was hoping

20:36.569 --> 20:38.269
We could get a little help
on a case we're on.

20:38.271 --> 20:40.137
- Maybe we could take a look
at the rental agreements

20:40.139 --> 20:42.873
From last night.
- Geez, no can do.

20:42.942 --> 20:44.408
- Oh...
- I could knock

20:44.410 --> 20:46.376
10% off a rental.
You gals need that?

20:49.081 --> 20:51.448
- Eros, that is the, um...

20:52.752 --> 20:55.152
That's the god of love, right?

20:55.154 --> 20:57.287
- (eros): You sure know
your greek mythology.

20:57.323 --> 21:00.224
- (frankie): Well, I bet you can
teach me a little bit more.

21:00.226 --> 21:02.092
(frankie and eros chuckling)

21:15.208 --> 21:17.041
- It's all here.
Everything we need

21:17.110 --> 21:18.242
For an official investigation.

21:18.244 --> 21:19.977
- But it was all
obtained illegally.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.913
- It's not illegal to take
photos of public property.

21:22.915 --> 21:25.982
- Except the road to access
the reservoir is private.

21:26.019 --> 21:28.319
And this. Do you have
an actual sample

21:28.454 --> 21:29.987
From the reservoir water itself
to match it to?

21:29.989 --> 21:31.655
- We could take
the water from my house.

21:31.658 --> 21:32.990
- That's not enough.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.658
That doesn't prove
it comes from the reservoir.

21:34.661 --> 21:37.128
- It stands to reason--
- reason isn't evidence,

21:37.263 --> 21:39.496
Just a smart guess.
- One phone call,

21:39.532 --> 21:40.864
And you could have that
by the end of the day.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.300
- Except this isn't a fiefdom.

21:42.435 --> 21:44.802
There's a system.
- Well, the system is broken.

21:44.937 --> 21:46.670
- Look. I grew up in a house
without running water.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.606
I know how vital it is,

21:48.608 --> 21:50.608
But my hands are tied.

21:50.610 --> 21:52.343
- So what proof do you need
to untie them?

21:52.345 --> 21:54.545
(phone ringing)
- excuse me.

21:56.616 --> 21:59.282
Just a moment.
You'll see yourselves out?

22:02.355 --> 22:04.488
Yes.
- That man's a liar.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.757
Toni's dossier is right there
on his desk where he left it.

22:06.892 --> 22:08.559
He hasn't even opened it.
- You're right.

22:08.694 --> 22:11.962
He never intended to read it.
- Something shady is going on.

22:12.098 --> 22:13.697
I bet the commissioner's
covering.

22:14.734 --> 22:17.234

22:24.911 --> 22:26.777
Welcome. You only missed
the entire show.

22:26.779 --> 22:28.379
- No, I'm sorry.
I must have missed--

22:28.514 --> 22:30.047
- If I wanted to be treated
so rudely, I would have had

22:30.116 --> 22:31.515
Kids of my own.
- Flo.

22:31.650 --> 22:33.183
- And the only way I could
get out of work today

Was by promising that I would do
weekends for a month.

22:35.988 --> 22:38.656

the wasted ticket. Ellie,

22:38.658 --> 22:40.391

How could you do that?!

22:53.106 --> 22:54.538

Silver star's rental list

25:00.799 --> 25:02.065
From the night
of the dumping.

25:02.101 --> 25:03.968
Three different companies
rented trucks that night:

25:03.970 --> 25:06.470
Mateosian meats,
bonbon's emporium,

25:06.472 --> 25:08.338
And kerrigan & harding metals.

the toxin, we can figure out

Which of these three companies
had access to it.

29:13.719 --> 29:16.319

It contains traces

And so does the water
from your tap, trudy.
It's definitely linked.

29:23.529 --> 29:26.263
- Well, flo, that's the evidence
we've been looking for.

29:26.332 --> 29:28.065
Copper acetate
sounds dangerous.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.133
- It's poisonous.
Large amounts can burn

29:30.169 --> 29:32.335
The lining in your throat
and cause vomiting.

29:32.371 --> 29:34.504
In small amounts, it can
make you feel nauseous.

- What is

29:35.775 --> 29:38.341
Copper acetate used for?
- Most commonly?

29:38.377 --> 29:41.078
In coloured pigments:
Dyes, paints...

29:41.213 --> 29:42.545
Used to be used
in food colouring.

29:42.581 --> 29:44.615
- Food colouring?
- Mm-hmm.

29:44.750 --> 29:47.818

it was listed

29:47.820 --> 29:48.952

29:49.087 --> 29:51.088

29:51.090 --> 29:53.489
But they shouldn't be using
copper acetate in their recipes,

29:53.526 --> 29:55.859
It's outlawed
on account of the poison!

29:55.994 --> 29:58.195

29:58.264 --> 30:01.431

Her mother. I don't want to

rosalyn to town.

30:30.496 --> 30:31.795

- You know you could
have told me.

42:14.866 --> 42:17.433
- I could have.
- I would have helped.

42:19.004 --> 42:19.936
- I didn't want you
to get in trouble.

42:21.540 --> 42:23.439
- How many times
have I been in trouble?

42:23.441 --> 42:24.506
- Yeah, I know.

42:25.977 --> 42:28.111
But this is my new home,

42:28.113 --> 42:29.779
My new community,
and if anyone

42:29.848 --> 42:31.647
Was gonna go to jail
for what I did,

42:31.683 --> 42:34.216
I wanted it to be me. Just me.

42:34.252 --> 42:36.586
- Ok, but if you ever
do it again--

42:36.655 --> 42:38.588
- What?

42:38.590 --> 42:41.156
- I want a costume!
(both laughing)

42:41.192 --> 42:44.093
- Deal!
- (boyzey): Aaah...

42:44.095 --> 42:47.096
Ok, so do you all want
to hear about our kiss

42:47.132 --> 42:49.331
One more time?
- (women): No!

42:49.367 --> 42:50.766
- I wonder when
we'll meet again.

42:52.036 --> 42:53.870
(news fanfare on radio)

42:54.005 --> 42:56.739
- (man on radio):<i> We interrupt</i>
<i>this program with breaking news.</i>

42:56.741 --> 42:59.809
<i> Regis walker, owner of the</i>
<i>bonbon's emporium candy chain,</i>

42:59.878 --> 43:02.011
<i> And his wife have escaped</i>
<i> police custody.</i>

43:02.080 --> 43:03.579
- What?
-<i> The couple are considered</i>

43:03.648 --> 43:06.215
<i> Armed and dangerous.</i>
- That is just reprehensible.

43:06.217 --> 43:08.184
- I can't believe
they're on the lam.

43:08.186 --> 43:10.419
-<i> ...Local police station house.</i>
- I guess justice never stops.

43:10.488 --> 43:12.622
-<i> They are armed</i>
<i> and considered dangerous.</i>

43:12.691 --> 43:14.957
<i> Contact your nearest</i>
<i> police station house.</i>

43:15.026 --> 43:17.426
(theme music)
