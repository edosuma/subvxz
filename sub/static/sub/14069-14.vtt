00:00.046 --> 00:01.252
<i>Previously on "Suits"...</i>

00:01.276 --> 00:02.063
It's a no.

00:02.064 --> 00:03.305
I thought you liked the idea.

00:03.329 --> 00:04.530
That was before I realized

00:04.531 --> 00:06.431
that it was nothing but
sassy remarks.

00:06.467 --> 00:08.178
I thought you wanted our baby
to have a relationship

00:08.202 --> 00:10.168
with its biological father.
If you're gonna get

00:10.204 --> 00:13.939
this worked up, it makes me
think I don't really know you.

00:13.974 --> 00:15.285
What if I could make it
more like you?

00:15.309 --> 00:16.753
I might be able
to give it the ability

00:16.777 --> 00:18.355
to learn from your heart.
You really think

00:18.379 --> 00:20.012
we could do that?
We can try.

00:20.047 --> 00:22.147
Rachel Zane deserves to be
in the Bar.

00:22.182 --> 00:24.016
You're not only gonna
stop blocking her,

00:24.051 --> 00:26.585
you're gonna run interference
for her if someone else does.

00:26.620 --> 00:28.253
And in return,
you'll do what I want.

00:28.288 --> 00:30.789
No, but I'll do what you want
for something else.

00:30.824 --> 00:32.101
We need to come up
with a lawsuit

00:32.125 --> 00:33.992
against Velocity Data Solutions.
No.

00:34.028 --> 00:35.639
- What do you mean, "no"?
- Fabricating a lawsuit

00:35.663 --> 00:37.262
to manipulate a stock
is illegal.

00:37.297 --> 00:39.264
It's not illegal if we find
a legitimate suit.

00:39.299 --> 00:41.444
Let's finish the job and get you
back to being a lawyer.

00:41.468 --> 00:43.535
"Tenants are required
to be notified

00:43.570 --> 00:45.937
of all construction
by certified letter."

00:45.973 --> 00:47.839
Is this a certified letter
or not?

00:47.875 --> 00:49.074
- Objection.
- Your Honor,

00:49.109 --> 00:51.109
this is the fraudulent attorney.
Open your mouth

00:51.145 --> 00:53.111
in my courtroom again
and you will be removed.

00:53.147 --> 00:55.180
Mr. Grady, do you have
an objection or not?

00:55.215 --> 00:56.948
- I don't.
- Then the court has no choice

00:56.984 --> 01:00.218
but to dismiss this case
with prejudice.

01:00.254 --> 01:02.187
The guy holding up your
interview was trying

01:02.222 --> 01:04.589
to get us to do something
because he thought he could.

01:04.625 --> 01:07.159
- Are you going to?
- Yes.

01:07.194 --> 01:08.627
He is.
Are you saying

01:08.662 --> 01:11.563
what I think you're saying?
I'm in.

01:14.301 --> 01:15.701
Okay, Rachel's gone.

01:15.736 --> 01:17.113
I don't want any bullshit.
You're telling me

01:17.137 --> 01:18.503
that no matter what we do,

01:18.539 --> 01:20.038
Rachel's getting into the Bar?

01:20.074 --> 01:22.374
What I'm telling you is
if she doesn't get in,

01:22.409 --> 01:25.243
that asshole isn't gonna be
the one that stopped her.

01:27.247 --> 01:30.449
Okay. I'm in.

01:30.484 --> 01:32.484
What do we have to do?

01:32.519 --> 01:34.297
I told you what we need to do.
We need to make a dent

01:34.321 --> 01:36.988
in Velocity Data's stock.
Harvey, that's no joke.

01:37.024 --> 01:38.735
You realize how much we're gonna
have to sue them for

01:38.759 --> 01:40.070
to make their earnings
take a hit?

01:40.094 --> 01:41.094
You're damn right I do.

01:41.128 --> 01:43.428
They're a huge company,
which means

01:43.464 --> 01:44.507
it's got to be something huge.

01:44.531 --> 01:45.709
I don't even know
if that matters.

01:45.733 --> 01:46.843
No matter what we sue them for,

01:46.867 --> 01:47.911
they're just gonna
want to settle.

01:47.935 --> 01:49.768
I know that.
Which means we need to insist

01:49.803 --> 01:51.570
on an admission of guilt.

01:51.605 --> 01:54.005
I get it.

01:54.041 --> 01:56.086
You want me to run this whole
thing through the clinic.

01:56.110 --> 01:59.044
It's the only way to make it
look legitimate.

01:59.079 --> 02:02.547
Harvey, I don't know if I can
convince Nathan to do that.

02:02.583 --> 02:04.716
Well, you better,
because if anyone figures out

02:04.752 --> 02:06.651
that we're doing this
for personal gain,

02:06.687 --> 02:09.554
your chance of
getting into the bar is gone.

02:13.694 --> 02:17.529
Wait, you were Captain
of the Glee Club?

02:17.564 --> 02:18.942
The official title
is Lieutenant Colonel,

02:18.966 --> 02:20.043
but that's cool
you didn't know that.

02:20.067 --> 02:22.334
Mm-hmm.

02:22.369 --> 02:26.238
Oh, my God. You still
had braces at 17.

02:26.273 --> 02:28.774
Actually, I had them again
at 28.

02:28.809 --> 02:30.108
Wow.

02:30.144 --> 02:33.612
Between this,
your nasal passages,

02:33.647 --> 02:35.847
the skin tag epidemic
and the foot surgeries,

02:35.883 --> 02:37.749
you really had a lot
of medical procedures.

02:37.785 --> 02:39.229
Tara, I know what you
must be thinking

02:39.253 --> 02:40.986
and I swear,

02:41.021 --> 02:42.988
I will not pass any of my
maladies onto our child.

02:43.023 --> 02:45.657
Louis,
I wasn't thinking that,

02:45.692 --> 02:47.926
but you do understand
that biologically

02:47.961 --> 02:50.028
this isn't your child.
Of course I do.

02:50.063 --> 02:51.930
Okay.

02:51.965 --> 02:53.176
But I was thinking
we would have at least

02:53.200 --> 02:55.300
one child of our own.

02:55.335 --> 02:57.469
At least?

02:57.504 --> 03:00.105
At least.

03:00.140 --> 03:01.106
You were right, Louis.

03:01.141 --> 03:03.575
Getting to know each other

03:14.822 --> 03:17.856
No, this is about
Velocity Data Solutions.

03:17.891 --> 03:20.025
- What about them?
- They're a dirty company.

03:20.060 --> 03:21.805
They've been getting away
with shit for years.

03:21.829 --> 03:23.840
I could never go after them
when I worked at Pearson Specter

03:23.864 --> 03:25.742
because we were always on
the other side of these things,

03:25.766 --> 03:28.767
but I can go after them now.

03:28.802 --> 03:31.303
Mike, if this is going

03:31.338 --> 03:34.239
It's not.

Look, Oliver, I know

But you don't have to be a trial
lawyer to be a great lawyer.

- What are you saying?
- I'm saying that you have

03:43.483 --> 03:45.183
skills that
other lawyers don't have

03:45.219 --> 03:48.620
and I'm gonna put those skills
to use right now.

03:48.655 --> 03:51.389
- What do you need?
- You see those boxes?

03:51.425 --> 03:54.059
That's every case that Velocity
has settled in the last 20 years

03:54.094 --> 03:55.872
where the names of
the plaintiffs have been sealed.

03:55.896 --> 03:57.596
We need to figure out
who those people are,

03:57.631 --> 03:59.471
what they got paid not to say,
and then we need

03:59.499 --> 04:02.434
to get every damn one of them
to come forward.

04:02.469 --> 04:04.069
Mike, what did
these guys do to you?

04:04.104 --> 04:05.481
They didn't do anything
to me, Oliver.

04:05.505 --> 04:06.883
I just don't like it when
people think they can get away

04:06.907 --> 04:09.341

nobody is watching.

04:14.381 --> 04:16.514
- That was fast.
- What was fast?

04:16.550 --> 04:17.515
Well, I assume you're here
to tell me

04:17.551 --> 04:18.884
you filed suit against Velocity.

04:18.918 --> 04:20.752
What I'm here
to tell you, Craig,

04:20.786 --> 04:22.821
is Mike Ross
is gonna handle Velocity.

04:22.856 --> 04:24.634
Then we have a problem,
'cause I didn't cut a deal

04:24.658 --> 04:26.102
with Mike Ross.
I cut a deal with you.

04:26.126 --> 04:28.093
And there's a reason
you're an in-house counsel

04:28.128 --> 04:30.295
and I'm not.
What are you talking about?

04:30.330 --> 04:32.163
Once we drop
whatever bomb we're gonna drop,

04:32.199 --> 04:34.377
they're gonna want to settle
without an admission of guilt

04:34.401 --> 04:36.668
and everyone knows
settling is what I do.

04:36.703 --> 04:38.637
So Mike Ross is gonna
take this to court?

04:38.672 --> 04:39.905
He's not even
a goddamn lawyer.

04:39.940 --> 04:41.606
Welcome to the conversation,
Craig.

04:41.642 --> 04:42.819
That's what I'm here
to talk about.

04:42.843 --> 04:44.876
You're gonna make
Mike's hearing official.

04:44.912 --> 04:46.578
I can't do that,
it's too soon.

04:46.613 --> 04:47.853
Bullshit.
You think I don't know

04:47.881 --> 04:50.081
you only said yes about Mike
to get me to help you?

04:50.117 --> 04:52.050
Of course that's why
I said yes.

04:52.085 --> 04:53.963
And the hardest thing about
getting him into the Bar

04:53.987 --> 04:56.499
is getting him a hearing when he
hasn't even gone to law school.

04:56.523 --> 04:58.390
Which is why you're
gonna sponsor him

04:58.425 --> 05:00.525
based on his years
of work at Pearson Specter.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.060
You're talking about
reading the law.

05:02.095 --> 05:03.061
You're damn right I am.

05:03.096 --> 05:05.330
There's precedent
and you know it.

05:05.365 --> 05:08.300
Listen to me,
I can influence the vote,

05:08.335 --> 05:10.635
but I cannot sponsor someone
I'm going to be voting on.

05:10.671 --> 05:12.003
Then find someone who will.

05:12.039 --> 05:13.917
Because if you can't get him
a hearing in the next week,

05:13.941 --> 05:14.906
this thing is off.

05:14.942 --> 05:16.241
And one more thing, Craig.

05:16.276 --> 05:17.943
You and I won't be
talking again

05:17.978 --> 05:19.844
because in case you haven't
figured it out yet,

05:19.880 --> 05:21.479
this is a hell of a lot
more serious

05:21.515 --> 05:23.548
than cheating on your wife.

What do you mean?
It's an executive kitchen.

06:08.380 --> 06:11.080
I'm an executive.
Yeah, but you're a bagel guy.

06:11.116 --> 06:12.493
This place is like
croissant central.

06:12.517 --> 06:14.317
Then maybe I just came in here

06:14.352 --> 06:16.185
hoping to spend some
quality time with you.

06:16.221 --> 06:18.065
Are you saying you want to

06:18.089 --> 06:19.188
Of course I do.

06:19.224 --> 06:20.601
Right after we make friendship
bracelets

06:20.625 --> 06:22.292
and braid each other's hair.

06:22.327 --> 06:24.460
For your information,
it was a magical evening,

06:24.496 --> 06:26.007
but actually,
I'm here to talk business.

06:26.031 --> 06:27.697
- What business?
- Couture Apparel.

06:27.732 --> 06:30.366
Jessica and I always gave
their CEO an annual analysis

06:30.402 --> 06:31.779
of their legal needs
for the upcoming year--

06:31.803 --> 06:33.603
And now that she's gone,
you want us to do it?

06:33.638 --> 06:34.604
Exactly.

06:34.639 --> 06:35.972
Sounds like
a dog and pony show.

06:36.007 --> 06:38.241
It is more than that, Harvey.
It is a show of force.

06:38.276 --> 06:40.276
For one day, Carly Donahue
needs to feel like

06:40.312 --> 06:42.178
the most important client
in the portfolio.

06:42.213 --> 06:44.681
And having one partner
go by himself

06:44.716 --> 06:46.516
doesn't send that message.
Louis, relax.

06:46.551 --> 06:47.917
I'm happy to do it.
You are?

06:47.953 --> 06:50.920
Of course I am.
I told you, we're partners.

06:50.956 --> 06:54.057
You know, Harvey, I always
dreamed it could be like this.

06:54.092 --> 06:56.259
Partners, confidantes,
friends

06:56.294 --> 06:57.860
I had the exact
same dream, Louis.

06:57.896 --> 06:59.762
- Really?
- No, not really.

06:59.798 --> 07:01.208
Does that mean you're never
gonna go mudding with me?

07:01.232 --> 07:03.833
Yes, Louis,
that's what it means.

07:03.868 --> 07:05.802
I'll give Donna the details
on that meeting.

07:11.009 --> 07:12.575
Hey, I hope you got a hammer,

07:12.611 --> 07:14.177
'cause I just brought you
some nails.

07:14.212 --> 07:15.845
- You found something?
- Yeah, I did.

07:15.880 --> 07:17.480
I already found six
cases we can use,

07:17.515 --> 07:18.960
and that's just the tip
of the iceberg.

07:18.984 --> 07:21.184
So let's grab our coats
and go kick Velocity's ass

07:21.219 --> 07:23.052
up and down the street.
Easy, Tyson.

07:23.088 --> 07:24.966
You have to tell me
what kind of suits these are.

07:24.990 --> 07:26.901
They're mining suits,
which means health problems

07:26.925 --> 07:28.858
or corporate negligence--
Either way, the damages

07:28.893 --> 07:30.093
could be through the roof.

07:30.128 --> 07:32.862
Oliver, this is great.

07:32.897 --> 07:36.065
I know. And if you asked me
to make an argument

07:36.101 --> 07:38.468
about it in court,
I'd probably shit the bed.

07:38.503 --> 07:40.314
But, Mike, I'm telling you,
there's something here.

07:40.338 --> 07:42.405
And I'm telling you,
maybe one day you'll overcome

07:42.440 --> 07:43.773
your court stuff,
maybe you won't.

07:43.808 --> 07:48.311
Either way, this proves that
you're a hell of a lawyer.

07:48.346 --> 07:50.580
Yeah, thanks, Mike.
I gotta admit,

07:50.615 --> 07:52.782
it feels pretty good to know
I can do what I just did.

07:52.817 --> 07:54.095
Then why don't you start
drafting a suit.

07:54.119 --> 07:55.496
'Cause after I get these
people on board,

07:55.520 --> 07:58.688
that's exactly
what we're gonna have to do.

08:05.530 --> 08:06.462
Donna,
you're never gonna believe

what Louis just asked me.

08:08.166 --> 08:09.499

without saying anything?

08:15.707 --> 08:17.418
What's the big deal?
You do it all the time.

08:17.442 --> 08:19.375
<i>The Donna: Good one, Donna.</i>
<i>You're on fire today.</i>

08:19.411 --> 08:21.277
Okay, what the hell's
going on here?

08:21.312 --> 08:23.680
Oh, you mean The Donna?
It's just a little product

08:23.715 --> 08:25.415
that Benjamin and I
have been working on.

08:25.450 --> 08:27.194
It doesn't have my emotional
intelligence yet

08:27.218 --> 08:29.719
but I thought I'd have a little
fun with it in the meantime.

08:29.754 --> 08:32.422
Do you have your emotional
intelligence yet?

08:32.457 --> 08:34.557
When it can top that,
you might have something.

08:37.227 --> 08:38.327
<i>The Donna: Loser.</i>

08:38.363 --> 08:42.030
Okay, which one of you
said that?

08:42.067 --> 08:43.232
both: She did.

08:50.909 --> 08:52.375
Sorry, buddy.
Grill's shut down.

08:52.410 --> 08:54.177
We don't open again till five.

08:54.212 --> 08:56.512
That's okay.
I'm not here for a cheeseburger.

08:56.548 --> 09:00.116
I'm here to talk about
Hazelton Mining Company.

09:00.151 --> 09:02.018
- What about it?
- You filed a complaint

09:02.053 --> 09:03.564
alleging life-threatening
health problems

09:03.588 --> 09:06.189
resulting from work.

09:06.224 --> 09:07.824
That complaint mysteriously
went away

09:07.859 --> 09:10.037
and I want to help you get the
compensation that you deserve.

09:10.061 --> 09:12.295
I don't need any help
from an ambulance chaser.

09:12.330 --> 09:14.664
I'm not an ambulance chaser,
Mr. Stamos.

09:14.699 --> 09:16.599
My name is Mike Ross,
I work at a clinic

09:16.634 --> 09:18.768
and our commissions are capped
at $50,000.

09:18.803 --> 09:20.737
So we are not in this
for the money.

09:20.772 --> 09:22.438
Then what are you in it for?

09:22.474 --> 09:24.407
Let's just say
Velocity is bad news,

09:24.442 --> 09:25.875
Well, I'd like to help,

09:25.910 --> 09:29.779
but even if I wanted to sue
those bastards, I can't.

09:29.814 --> 09:31.981
I know.
You took a payout

09:32.016 --> 09:33.494
and you signed
a non-disclosure agreement.

09:33.518 --> 09:34.917
That's got nothing
to do with it.

09:34.953 --> 09:36.986
They made us
all sign those things.

09:37.021 --> 09:39.288
If any one of us breaks it,
it negates them all.

09:39.324 --> 09:41.624
Then negate them all.

09:41.659 --> 09:44.460
That's easy for you to say.

09:44.496 --> 09:47.764
I'm dying of something
with a name so long,

09:47.799 --> 09:50.566
I can't even tell you
what it is.

09:50.602 --> 09:52.635
And you're talking about
your fee being capped

09:52.670 --> 09:54.103
at more money
than they paid me.

09:54.139 --> 09:56.172
Listen to me, if that's really
all they paid you,

09:56.207 --> 09:59.108
and you really are dying,
we can shatter those NDAs

09:59.144 --> 10:03.012
in about five seconds.

10:03.047 --> 10:06.716
You don't understand.

10:06.751 --> 10:09.952
I was their supervisor,
Mr. Ross.

10:09.988 --> 10:13.689
I was responsible
for all those guys that got sick

10:13.725 --> 10:15.424
and I'm the one that
got us the money

10:15.460 --> 10:18.361
that went with those NDAs.

10:18.396 --> 10:20.363
And let me guess:

10:20.398 --> 10:21.531
ever since you signed them,

10:21.566 --> 10:23.299
you haven't had
a good night's sleep.

10:25.837 --> 10:28.337
Tell me I'm wrong,
I'll leave right now.

Listen--

11:21.993 --> 11:24.026
No, Harvey,
I need you to listen.

11:24.062 --> 11:26.462
He just spent the past
couple months in prison,

11:26.497 --> 11:27.708
and it was supposed to be years.

11:27.732 --> 11:29.632

- Yeah, what's up?

11:59.297 --> 12:00.663
I was hoping you could
tell me.

12:00.698 --> 12:02.676
Apparently Oliver was in
the conference room all day

12:02.700 --> 12:05.801
working on some case
against Velocity Data.

12:05.837 --> 12:07.637
Uh, yeah,
I gave him an assignment.

12:07.672 --> 12:09.450
What do you mean
you "gave him an assignment"?

12:09.474 --> 12:11.274
He had the workers comp case.

12:11.309 --> 12:13.075
I took care of that.

12:13.111 --> 12:15.344
Mike, your job isn't
to generate cases.

12:15.380 --> 12:17.680
It's to consult on the cases
we've already taken.

12:17.715 --> 12:18.993
I know that,
but it's also to help

12:19.017 --> 12:21.684
our associates
become better lawyers.

12:21.719 --> 12:23.530
Oliver got his ass kicked
in court the other day.

12:23.554 --> 12:24.865
I'm just helping
to build him back up.

12:24.889 --> 12:25.855
And there are plenty
of other cases

12:25.890 --> 12:27.001
you could've used to do that.

12:27.025 --> 12:28.958
Instead, you went
and you signed a class action,

12:28.993 --> 12:30.593
which is something we do not do.

12:30.628 --> 12:32.461
Well, why isn't it
something we do?

12:32.497 --> 12:34.337
These men have life-threatening
health problems

12:34.365 --> 12:35.910
They need someone
to give a shit about them.

12:35.934 --> 12:37.111
It isn't something we do
because we don't have

12:37.135 --> 12:39.001
the time or the man power

12:39.037 --> 12:41.871

understand the feelings

15:17.526 --> 15:19.326

15:20.529 --> 15:24.031
that my co-counsel on this

15:24.066 --> 15:26.533
Bullshit. Their name's not on
any one of these documents.

15:26.569 --> 15:28.146
'Cause they wanted to keep
a low profile,

15:28.170 --> 15:32.072
but go ahead, pick up the phone.
I'll call them myself.

15:32.108 --> 15:35.342
Then I guess I'll see you

I just got a phone call

15:49.825 --> 15:51.792
from the lawyers at Velocity,

15:51.827 --> 15:53.205
They wanted me to confirm that
we're co-counsel

15:53.229 --> 15:55.095
with Mike on this.
What'd you tell them?

15:55.131 --> 15:56.708
What do you think I told them?
I told them yes.

15:56.732 --> 15:58.410
Because if they're asking,
he obviously bluffed

15:58.434 --> 16:01.068
and I'm not gonna hang him
out to dry.

16:01.103 --> 16:02.447
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna find out

16:02.471 --> 16:05.506
what he did
and why he did it.

16:09.945 --> 16:11.590
- What the hell did you do?
- Relax, Harvey,

16:11.614 --> 16:13.458
I was just coming to tell you--
No, I specifically

16:13.482 --> 16:15.427
said that I can't be seen
to be involved in this thing.

16:15.451 --> 16:17.418
And you also said we only had
one shot at this.

16:17.453 --> 16:18.797
I was the one in the room
with this guy.

16:18.821 --> 16:20.621
He had me and he knew it.
So what?

16:20.656 --> 16:21.933
So you always said that
if I'm in a knife fight

16:21.957 --> 16:23.257
and I'm losing,
to pick up a gun.

16:23.292 --> 16:25.793
And Pearson Specter Litt
is a goddamn gun.

16:25.828 --> 16:27.728
Look, I know this isn't
exactly what we wanted,

16:27.763 --> 16:29.875
but I can still be the one to
insist on an admission of guilt,

16:29.899 --> 16:31.799
so what's really going on here?

16:31.834 --> 16:34.101
I promised Rachel
that if this thing got too risky

16:34.136 --> 16:36.703
I'd pull the plug, and it just
got a hell of a lot riskier.

16:36.739 --> 16:38.539
Well, it also got real.

16:38.574 --> 16:40.741
Those miners need us.

16:40.776 --> 16:44.344
I'm not going to
abandon them, so...

16:44.380 --> 16:46.847
what do you wanna do?

16:46.882 --> 16:47.848
What do you think
I want to do?

16:47.883 --> 16:49.450
I wanna kick this guy's ass.

16:49.485 --> 16:51.885
Then here's the situation:
I got a 150 miners on board

16:51.921 --> 16:53.087
and I can bust the NDAs.

16:53.122 --> 16:54.266
But I can't make
the action a class

16:54.290 --> 16:55.700
'cause they already
signed those rights away.

16:55.724 --> 16:57.524
I get it.
He doesn't think

16:57.560 --> 16:59.626
we can get all those
separate cases to court.

16:59.662 --> 17:01.595
Well, he's got
another thing coming.

17:01.630 --> 17:04.031
I got ten brand-new
associates upstairs

17:04.066 --> 17:05.632
begging to work
on a case like this.

17:05.667 --> 17:07.401
You're gonna oversee
every single one them

17:07.435 --> 17:08.946
if it takes all night.
Then I have to meet you

17:08.971 --> 17:10.471
at your office in an hour.

17:10.506 --> 17:13.272
Something I need to
take care of first.

17:18.948 --> 17:20.759
Louis, whatever it is,
it's gonna have to wait.

17:20.782 --> 17:21.926
No, this'll just
take a second.

17:21.951 --> 17:23.228
It's about
the Carly Donahue meeting.

17:23.252 --> 17:24.917
I was thinking--
Louis, I'm sorry,

17:24.954 --> 17:26.553
but I'm not gonna
be able to make it.

17:26.589 --> 17:29.957
- What? Why the hell not?
- Mike needs my help on a case.

17:29.992 --> 17:31.169
Harvey, you may not want
to accept this,

17:31.193 --> 17:32.759
but Mike doesn't
work here anymore.

17:32.795 --> 17:34.428
and firm business takes
priority over--

17:34.463 --> 17:37.231
Listen, Louis,
this is firm business

17:37.266 --> 17:39.566
and if what I think
is gonna happen happens,

17:39.602 --> 17:41.735
Mike's gonna end up
back here when it's done.

17:41.770 --> 17:43.070
- What?
- You remember that thing

17:43.105 --> 17:44.438
that we took care of for Rachel

17:44.473 --> 17:46.039
that you said might
be worth doing?

17:46.075 --> 17:48.308
Well, it turns out
it was worth doing.

17:48.344 --> 17:49.910
Only I'm doing it for Mike.

17:49.945 --> 17:51.879
Holy shit. Seidel agreed
to go to bat for him?

17:51.914 --> 17:54.114
Yes, and once it's done
and Mike's in the Bar,

17:54.150 --> 17:56.049
he can come back here
and work again.

17:56.085 --> 17:57.384
Harvey, that is great

17:57.419 --> 17:59.319
and nobody wants that
more than I do,

17:59.355 --> 18:01.221
but it's just one meeting.
Louis, I know that,

18:01.257 --> 18:03.201
but in about three hours,
I'm gonna be under water

18:03.225 --> 18:04.858
for the next three days.
Harvey--

18:04.894 --> 18:07.828
Louis, I know I told you
I'd be there for you,

18:07.863 --> 18:11.932
but I need you
to be there for me.

18:11.967 --> 18:13.767
Okay, Harvey,
I'll do it.

18:15.000 --> 18:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

18:27.917 --> 18:29.983
Good, you're still here.
Box up the Velocity files

18:30.019 --> 18:31.663
and meet me downstairs.
Where are we going?

18:31.687 --> 18:33.331
Pearson Specter agreed
to partner up on the case.

18:33.355 --> 18:34.821
- Shit, that's big.
- Want in?

18:34.857 --> 18:37.524
Hell yeah.
Give me ten minutes.

18:37.560 --> 18:39.760
- Hey.
- Yeah?

18:39.795 --> 18:41.028
You wanna tell me
what this is?

18:41.063 --> 18:42.696
That is an agreement
to co-counsel

18:42.731 --> 18:44.209
and I was just gonna come
tell you about it.

18:44.233 --> 18:45.577
How many times are you gonna
make a move without telling me?

18:45.601 --> 18:47.467
Nathan, I'm sorry,
but I had to move fast.

18:47.503 --> 18:50.404
The guy at Velocity was
putting the screws to me.

18:50.439 --> 18:52.172
Is something shady
going on here, Mike?

18:52.208 --> 18:53.173
- What?
- First you bring in

18:53.209 --> 18:54.575
this huge case out of the blue.

18:54.610 --> 18:56.388
Then all of sudden, you're
bringing in your old firm.

18:56.412 --> 18:57.789
You're the one who said we
didn't have the resources

18:57.813 --> 18:58.779
to handle this sort of thing,

18:58.814 --> 19:00.292
so I just brought in
someone who would.

19:00.316 --> 19:01.526
Yeah, and I bet they're
getting a sweet deal out of it.

19:01.550 --> 19:02.616
It's not like that.

19:02.651 --> 19:04.184
They're taking
half their usual fee.

19:04.220 --> 19:06.264
That's all they're getting.
And what about you, Mike?

19:06.288 --> 19:08.099
What are you getting?
What are you talking about?

19:08.123 --> 19:09.401
You're gonna tell me
you're not using this

19:09.425 --> 19:11.069
as a stepping stone
to get back to your old firm?

19:11.093 --> 19:13.026
What? No, Nathan,
I don't want to go back there.

19:13.062 --> 19:14.172
Bullshit.
I don't believe you.

19:14.196 --> 19:16.096
Something is going on here
and I know it.

19:16.131 --> 19:19.132
You know what, Nathan?

19:19.168 --> 19:21.602
For your information,
Harvey Specter did offer me

19:21.637 --> 19:23.136
a consulting job
just like you did,

19:23.172 --> 19:25.105
except his had one more zero
at the end of it,

19:25.140 --> 19:27.341
and I still turned him down.

19:29.411 --> 19:31.845
I chose to be here,

19:31.880 --> 19:33.692
but I don't want to be
second-guessed at every turn.

19:33.716 --> 19:35.026
So either you're gonna trust
that my heart

19:35.050 --> 19:39.219
is in the right place
or you're not.

19:39.255 --> 19:41.722
Well, for your
information, Mike,

19:41.757 --> 19:43.890
right now I really
don't have a choice.

20:02.107 --> 20:05.743
- Hey, are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

20:05.778 --> 20:07.756
How the hell am I supposed
to keep Carly Donahue's business

20:07.780 --> 20:09.580
all by myself?
Because, Louis,

20:09.681 --> 20:11.994
you're co-managing partner
and you're one hell of a lawyer.

20:12.018 --> 20:13.884
Oh, you just don't
get it, do you?

20:13.920 --> 20:16.821
This woman wants to know
that she's special to this firm.

20:16.856 --> 20:18.367
If I walk in there by myself,
she's gonna

20:18.391 --> 20:19.802
laugh me out of the room.
Then why didn't you

20:19.826 --> 20:21.258
tell that to Harvey?
Because I know

20:21.294 --> 20:22.426
how important Mike is to him

20:22.462 --> 20:23.861
and I didn't want to
let him down.

20:23.896 --> 20:24.940
- Then don't.
- That is not--

20:24.964 --> 20:26.241
Louis, if this woman
needs to know

20:26.265 --> 20:28.065
she's special to us,
there's more than one way

20:28.101 --> 20:30.079
to do it and Harvey's
not the only one you can bring.

20:30.103 --> 20:31.580
Donna, that's great.
But this meeting is tomorrow

20:31.604 --> 20:33.115
and I don't even know
these new associates yet.

20:33.139 --> 20:34.805
Yes, you do.
You know Katrina,

20:34.841 --> 20:37.108
who's not just a new associate,
she's a Junior Partner

20:37.143 --> 20:40.077
and you know Rachel,
who's as good as a fourth-year.

20:40.113 --> 20:41.946
You go there with
a show of force like that,

20:41.981 --> 20:46.751
trust me, this woman
is gonna be blown away.

20:46.786 --> 20:50.454
Okay, Donna.
Show of force it is.

20:51.524 --> 20:54.358
Holy shit,
Otis Redding's first album?

20:54.394 --> 20:56.227
You sure Harvey won't mind
if I take it out?

20:56.262 --> 20:57.595
Are you kidding me?

20:57.630 --> 20:59.475
No, he says if that collection's
not for everyone,

20:59.499 --> 21:01.076
then what's the point
of even having it here?

21:01.100 --> 21:03.267
- Sounds like a great guy.
- The best.

21:03.302 --> 21:05.236
Ghandi. Harvey.

21:05.271 --> 21:06.904
- You serious?
- Hand to God.

21:06.939 --> 21:09.240
Man's practically a saint.

21:09.275 --> 21:11.409
- What's going on?
- Oliver, Harvey Specter.

21:11.444 --> 21:13.044
Harvey Specter, Oliver.

21:13.079 --> 21:14.612
Nice to meet you, Oliver.

21:14.647 --> 21:17.114
Would you like me
to pour you a drink?

21:17.150 --> 21:18.949
- Would you?
- No, I wouldn't.

21:18.985 --> 21:21.152
Now put that down,
get out of my office

21:21.187 --> 21:22.965
and if I ever catch you
touching one of my things again,

21:22.989 --> 21:25.923
I'll shove it up your ass.
Is he serious?

21:25.958 --> 21:30.227
Oh, not about the ass part,
but I'd put it back.

21:30.263 --> 21:31.996
- You set me up.
- Mm-hmm.

21:32.031 --> 21:34.632
Welcome to
Pearson Specter Litt.

21:34.667 --> 21:37.134
[laughs] You enjoy that?

21:37.170 --> 21:39.670
- Yeah, it felt okay.
- Good. Now why don't you go

21:39.706 --> 21:42.473
make sure everyone knows exactly
what they're doing

21:42.508 --> 21:43.941
It's 9:00 p.m.,
the clock's ticking

21:43.976 --> 21:45.576
and we gotta
get this thing done.

21:45.611 --> 21:47.056
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna figure out

21:47.080 --> 21:48.991
what we're going to say
to that Velocity son of a bitch

21:49.015 --> 21:52.183
when he walks in here tomorrow
begging for a settlement.

21:54.187 --> 21:55.553
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

21:55.588 --> 21:57.288
Do you have any idea
what this is about?

21:57.323 --> 22:00.124
Gretchen said that Louis had
some special assignment for us.

22:00.159 --> 22:01.926
All I know is I got
a rambling voicemail

22:01.961 --> 22:04.495
- about Neapolitan ice cream.
- Neapolitan ice cream?

22:04.530 --> 22:06.564
Yes.
Chocolate and vanilla

22:06.599 --> 22:08.432
melded beautifully
with strawberry.

22:08.468 --> 22:10.401
Just like we're about to do
for Carly Donahue.

22:10.436 --> 22:11.847
Louis, did you just
call me chocolate?

22:11.871 --> 22:13.315
Why would I do that?
You're my white swan,

22:13.339 --> 22:15.084
Katrina's my black swan.
The math ain't that hard.

22:15.108 --> 22:16.841
What's with the boxes, Louis?

22:16.876 --> 22:18.609
This is everything
the firm has ever done

22:18.644 --> 22:19.710
for Couture Apparel.

22:19.746 --> 22:21.345
You're taking us
to your annual meeting?

22:21.380 --> 22:22.546
I'm not just taking you.

22:22.582 --> 22:24.181
We're running it together.
Okay, Louis--

22:24.217 --> 22:25.527
I know what you're thinking.
How the hell

22:25.551 --> 22:27.329
are a Junior Partner
and a third-year law student

22:27.353 --> 22:29.153
supposed to
fill Jessica's size 13s?

22:29.188 --> 22:31.055
Well the answer is:
you can't.

22:31.090 --> 22:32.823
No one can.
Then why are we here?

22:32.859 --> 22:35.326
Because we used to
dazzle Carly with rank.

22:35.361 --> 22:38.195
This year, we're gonna
dazzle her with substance.

22:38.231 --> 22:40.397
By knowing her business
better than anyone else.

22:40.433 --> 22:41.633
I'll take care of
the business.

22:41.667 --> 22:43.868
What you two are gonna do
is personally tailor

22:43.903 --> 22:45.736
the presentation to her.

22:45.772 --> 22:48.372
And as of now, we have
less than 24 hours to do that.

22:48.407 --> 22:51.542
- We won't let you down, Louis.
- I know you won't.

22:53.880 --> 22:55.846
You think Jessica
really wears size 13s?

22:55.882 --> 22:57.681
That's exactly what
I was thinking.

23:02.588 --> 23:05.956
Oliver, how's it going?

23:05.992 --> 23:07.124
It's going okay.

23:07.160 --> 23:10.127
I'm finished
drafting six complaints.

23:10.163 --> 23:12.630
What is it?

23:12.665 --> 23:16.000
It's nothing, it's just,
in the time I did six,

23:16.035 --> 23:20.471
most of them did nine or ten.

23:20.506 --> 23:23.741
I guess that means
you're in the home stretch, huh?

23:23.776 --> 23:25.609
Guess I am.

23:28.047 --> 23:30.981
Look, Oliver,
I know what you're thinking.

23:31.017 --> 23:34.218
But I was telling Nathan
the truth.

23:34.253 --> 23:35.798
I'm not looking to come back
here with these guys

23:35.822 --> 23:38.823
instead of working with you.

23:38.858 --> 23:41.125
I know you don't wanna
come back here, Mike.

23:41.160 --> 23:43.928
I guess I just wanted to say
these associates are bad ass,

23:43.963 --> 23:46.463
and I appreciate you choosing
to work with someone like me

23:46.499 --> 23:48.799
over them.

23:48.835 --> 23:50.078
You mind if I ask
how you're so sure

23:50.102 --> 23:51.502
I don't want to come back here?

23:51.537 --> 23:53.437
Because these associates
are amazing lawyers,

23:53.472 --> 23:56.040
but not a single one of them
mentioned an actual human being

23:56.075 --> 23:59.410
involved in this case
the whole night.

23:59.445 --> 24:01.045
They're just trying to win.

24:01.080 --> 24:02.713
And there's nothing
wrong with that,

24:02.748 --> 24:04.515
but that's not you.

24:04.550 --> 24:08.118
Yeah, Oliver, there is
something wrong with that.

24:08.154 --> 24:09.665
And that's why you're
gonna be a better lawyer

24:09.689 --> 24:13.357
than any one of these guys.

24:13.392 --> 24:16.093
I'm gonna go tell Harvey
that we're in the home stretch.

24:20.533 --> 24:22.867
[footsteps approaching]

24:22.902 --> 24:27.171
- How's it going, genius?
- What?

24:27.206 --> 24:29.406
I said, how's it going?

24:29.442 --> 24:31.609
I'll tell you how it's going.

24:31.644 --> 24:33.110
It's not going to work.
What?

24:33.145 --> 24:34.723
But I thought that you said--
I don't care what you thought.

24:34.747 --> 24:37.181
This isn't "Westworld."
I can't make her human.

24:37.216 --> 24:39.027
Benjamin, I'm not asking you
to make her human.

24:39.051 --> 24:40.963
I'm just asking you to give her
a little compassion.

24:40.987 --> 24:42.786
Well I don't know how
to do that.

24:42.822 --> 24:45.422
And it's supposed to learn
from itself, but it isn't.

24:48.294 --> 24:51.362
Hey, what's going on?

24:54.767 --> 24:56.645
The story I always told myself
was the only reason

24:56.669 --> 25:00.104
I didn't work in Silicon Valley
was that I didn't want to,

25:00.139 --> 25:04.375
but the truth is,
I don't have what it takes.

25:04.410 --> 25:07.144
And then you come in here,
calling me a genius and--

25:07.179 --> 25:10.381
Benjamin, it's okay.

25:10.416 --> 25:12.950
You're only human.

25:12.985 --> 25:16.353
If it doesn't work,
it doesn't work.

25:16.389 --> 25:18.689
Really?

25:18.724 --> 25:20.591
Really.

25:20.626 --> 25:22.192
Besides, if I can't show
you compassion,

25:22.228 --> 25:26.764
how can I ever expect The Donna
to show compassion?

25:26.799 --> 25:28.999
Thanks Donna.

25:29.035 --> 25:31.702
I'm sorry
if I got your hopes up.

25:39.812 --> 25:41.290
Figure out what we're going
to say tomorrow?

25:41.314 --> 25:42.613
You get those complaints
ready?

25:42.648 --> 25:44.648
- I asked you first.
- Yeah, but I'm not the one

25:44.684 --> 25:46.595
who had the least experienced
lawyer I've ever met

25:46.619 --> 25:48.118
put this thing
over the goal line.

25:48.154 --> 25:50.098
Come on, I thought I was
the least experienced lawyer

25:50.122 --> 25:51.322
you've ever met.
No, you were

25:51.357 --> 25:53.157
the least experienced dickhead
I ever met.

25:53.192 --> 25:55.626
- Right.
- Because that kid may be green,

25:55.661 --> 25:57.361
but he's the only one of you two

25:57.396 --> 25:59.330
that actually went
to law school.

25:59.365 --> 26:03.000
[laughs] Don't I know it.

26:03.035 --> 26:04.601
Mike, what's on your mind?

26:04.637 --> 26:06.804
Nothing. It's just--
this whole thing we're doing

26:06.839 --> 26:09.273
is making me lie to a lot
of people, including Oliver

26:09.308 --> 26:12.543
and I'm not thrilled about it.

26:12.578 --> 26:14.278
What are you talking about?

26:14.313 --> 26:15.691
Nathan thinks
there's an ulterior motive

26:15.715 --> 26:17.948
to this case and he's right.

26:17.984 --> 26:21.919
Oliver saw it and I had to lie
to them both to cover it up.

26:21.954 --> 26:24.555
Maybe that's true,
but you need to

26:24.590 --> 26:26.423
keep your eye on the ball.

26:26.459 --> 26:28.158
You deserve to be a lawyer.

26:28.194 --> 26:29.693
You're doing good
for those miners

26:29.729 --> 26:31.929
and that's all that matters.
I don't know, Harvey.

26:31.964 --> 26:34.665
What do you care so much about
what this kid thinks anyway?

26:34.700 --> 26:36.545
Because he's the reason
I decided to change my mind

26:36.569 --> 26:38.369
about doing this whole thing.

26:38.404 --> 26:40.371
- What do you mean?
- He's a great kid.

26:40.406 --> 26:42.740
And he's gonna be
a great lawyer.

26:42.775 --> 26:46.677
But I had to watch him
tank a case without being

26:46.712 --> 26:49.980
able to help him and a woman
ended up out on the street.

26:50.016 --> 26:53.317
I thought if we do this, then
I'll never to have to sit back

26:53.352 --> 26:55.185
and do nothing
when someone I care about

26:55.221 --> 26:57.054
is losing ever again.

26:57.089 --> 26:59.456
Then stop worrying about
what we're doing

26:59.492 --> 27:01.892
because tomorrow
isn't about losing.

27:01.927 --> 27:03.494
It's about winning.

27:10.806 --> 27:12.807
This is ridiculous.

27:12.843 --> 27:14.387
We've been up all night
and we've got nothing.

27:14.411 --> 27:16.311
- Yes, we do.
- What is this?

27:16.346 --> 27:19.314
This is the key to keeping
Carly Donahue's business.

27:19.349 --> 27:20.648
How is a three-year-old
interview

27:20.684 --> 27:22.450
with "Gourmand Magazine"
going to help us?

27:22.486 --> 27:24.119
Because it shows
she's a foodie.

27:24.154 --> 27:26.421
And like Louis said,
we need to show her

27:26.456 --> 27:30.258
that we don't only understand
her company, we understand her.

27:30.293 --> 27:31.960
I get it.

27:31.995 --> 27:33.495
What if we structured
the presentation

27:33.530 --> 27:36.131
like a nine course meal
and paired a discrete piece

27:36.166 --> 27:37.832
of legal analysis
with each course?

27:37.868 --> 27:39.234
Like a paired wine tasting.

27:39.269 --> 27:43.304
Coupled with
a paired wine tasting.

27:43.340 --> 27:45.206
Hold on,
are you a foodie, too?

27:45.242 --> 27:47.442
What I am is a lover
of fine wine,

27:47.477 --> 27:49.244
delightful cuisine
and the ballet.

27:49.279 --> 27:51.479
In any order you pick.
[chuckles] Well, I don't think

27:51.515 --> 27:52.859
we can have dancers
at the meeting.

27:52.883 --> 27:55.483
No, we can't. Which means
unless you know how to cook,

27:55.519 --> 27:57.196
we need to find ourselves
a world class chef

27:57.220 --> 27:59.554
and we need to find it fast.

27:59.589 --> 28:02.323
What about this:
Mike and I just met with

28:02.359 --> 28:05.527
a world class, French-trained
chef to cater our wedding.

28:05.562 --> 28:07.862
I mean, if he's available then--
Book him.

28:07.898 --> 28:09.275
Well don't you wanna hear
more about his--

28:09.299 --> 28:10.943
Rachel, if I can't trust
your taste in pairings,

28:10.967 --> 28:13.601
I can't trust anyone's.
What are you talking about?

28:13.637 --> 28:15.937
I never thanked you for this,
but you knew

28:15.972 --> 28:18.306
your father and I
would be a great fit.

28:18.341 --> 28:23.244
And if you hadn't set me up with
him after I was fired,

28:23.280 --> 28:24.913
I don't know what
I would have done.

28:27.984 --> 28:29.717
I'll book the chef.

28:39.162 --> 28:40.795
I assume from the fact
that you called,

28:40.831 --> 28:42.397
you got our Christmas present.

28:42.432 --> 28:44.799
I didn't call you,
I called Harvey Specter.

28:44.835 --> 28:46.734
Well, he called me.
And I wanted to come

28:46.770 --> 28:49.504
have a little chat with you
before you got it into your head

28:49.539 --> 28:50.872
that you could go behind my back

28:50.907 --> 28:54.242
and cut a deal without
an admission of guilt.

28:54.277 --> 28:55.643
- What?
- Look, I don't give a shit

28:55.679 --> 28:57.312
how much you offered,

28:57.347 --> 28:58.658
you're not gonna
buy your way out of this thing

28:58.682 --> 29:00.482
without telling the world
what you did.

29:00.517 --> 29:02.984
I don't think you understand
what the word settlement means.

29:03.019 --> 29:05.620
I understand
what it means to you,

29:05.655 --> 29:09.090
I just don't give a shit.

29:09.125 --> 29:11.037
- One hundred million.
- With an admission of guilt.

29:11.061 --> 29:12.360
Sure, where do I sign?

29:12.395 --> 29:13.828
Listen to me.

29:13.864 --> 29:16.664
$100 million is the biggest
payout this company's ever made.

29:16.700 --> 29:18.566
No, it's not
because I'm not taking it.

29:18.602 --> 29:19.634
What is wrong with you?

29:19.669 --> 29:21.113
I'm willing to cut
your clients a check

29:21.137 --> 29:23.416
that'll change their lives
and you're too stupid to see it.

29:23.440 --> 29:25.740
Here's what I see:
Every day this case drags on,

29:25.775 --> 29:27.242
your stock is gonna take a hit.

29:27.277 --> 29:29.010
And every quarter
when the board meets,

29:29.045 --> 29:30.712
that's gonna be
their first question

29:30.747 --> 29:33.815
and your biggest
God damn headache.

29:33.850 --> 29:36.417
So the real question
is are you ready

29:36.453 --> 29:40.021
to take responsibility
for what you did or not?

29:45.695 --> 29:48.329
I see you wore your power suit
for your return to the majors.

29:48.365 --> 29:49.697
You gonna play in Yankee
Stadium,

29:49.733 --> 29:51.199
you gotta wear the pinstripes.

29:51.234 --> 29:52.700
How'd it go?

29:52.736 --> 29:54.869
Good. He did exactly
what we thought he would.

29:54.905 --> 29:56.704
Tried to lowball me,
called me an idiot

29:56.740 --> 29:58.039
and then kicked me out.

29:58.074 --> 29:59.040
How high did he go?

29:59.075 --> 30:01.075
- A hundred million.
- [scoffs]

30:01.111 --> 30:02.510
- What?
- Nothing, it's just

30:02.546 --> 30:03.756
I would've gotten him up to two.

30:03.780 --> 30:04.891
And how exactly would
you have done that

30:04.915 --> 30:06.247
when you told me
not to counter?

30:06.283 --> 30:09.617
I'm more intimidating.
I walk into a room, people cave.

30:09.653 --> 30:10.618
It's a gift.
I think it's a gift

30:10.654 --> 30:12.554
when you leave the room.
My gift to you

30:12.589 --> 30:14.856
was saving your ass
when you screwed the pooch

30:14.891 --> 30:19.127
by involving me in this case.

30:19.162 --> 30:21.896
Seriously, Harvey,
I appreciate you

30:21.932 --> 30:23.698
rolling with this thing.

30:23.733 --> 30:25.667
Especially when
I had to improvise.

30:25.702 --> 30:27.502
Don't worry about it.
The truth is,

30:27.537 --> 30:29.837
I like getting the chance
to work with you again.

30:29.873 --> 30:32.507
Besides, don't tell Rachel,
I like the added risk.

30:32.542 --> 30:34.676
- Oh, I know.
- How do you know?

30:34.711 --> 30:36.010
'Cause you told me.

30:36.046 --> 30:38.279
"Life's like this,
but I like this."

30:38.315 --> 30:39.847
What am I, Luke Perry?

30:39.883 --> 30:41.583
- Sometimes.
- Look, I gotta go.

30:41.618 --> 30:44.285
'Cause this asshole's gonna be
back in my office in an hour,

30:44.321 --> 30:47.121
trying to cut a deal with me
behind your back.

30:55.732 --> 30:58.199
Oh, my God.

30:58.234 --> 31:00.068
This is amazing.
You really think so?

31:00.103 --> 31:01.936
I know so.
It's the perfect legal analysis

31:01.972 --> 31:03.382
combined with
the perfect presentation.

31:03.406 --> 31:05.151
So, you don't think the fact
that Jessica isn't here--

31:05.175 --> 31:07.175
Jessica Schmessica.
Carly's gonna be blown away.

31:07.210 --> 31:08.810
I should promote
you both right now.

31:08.845 --> 31:09.944
- Will you?
- No.

31:09.980 --> 31:11.424
- Worth a try.
- Okay, we have some time.

31:11.448 --> 31:13.381
So I'll meet you both
back here in an hour.

31:13.416 --> 31:15.850
- Where are you going?
- Gonna go have a prunie.

31:15.885 --> 31:18.252
Wanna clean out the pipes
for the nine course meal.

31:21.491 --> 31:24.292
Mike Ross.

31:24.327 --> 31:26.728
- Yes?
- I'm Craig Seidel.

31:26.763 --> 31:28.229
What?
What are you doing here?

31:28.264 --> 31:29.442
I wanna know
what the hell you're doing.

31:29.466 --> 31:30.509
What you mean,
what am I doing?

31:30.533 --> 31:32.634
I mean, you filed 150 suits,
not just one.

31:32.669 --> 31:34.280
And James Palmer's
gonna fight each one of them.

31:34.304 --> 31:36.048
Which means this thing
is gonna drag on forever.

31:36.072 --> 31:37.550
And we're gonna
drop the hammer on him

31:37.574 --> 31:38.684
as soon as he gets to Harvey's.

31:38.708 --> 31:40.008
Now I don't wanna see you again

31:40.043 --> 31:43.177
until I meet you for the first
time at that hearing.

31:43.213 --> 31:45.179
Don't you walk away from me.

31:45.215 --> 31:47.193
I hired Harvey to do a job,
he farmed it out to you

31:47.217 --> 31:49.061
against my will and you're gonna
God damn listen to me.

31:49.085 --> 31:50.618
No, you didn't hire Harvey.

31:50.654 --> 31:52.987
You tried to mess with my
fiancée's life and you're lucky

31:53.023 --> 31:54.555
we didn't
have you disbarred.

31:54.591 --> 31:55.835
So instead of coming
to my place of work

31:55.859 --> 31:57.203
and harassing me,
why don't you go back

31:57.227 --> 31:58.993
to your hole
and we'll tell you it's done.

31:59.029 --> 32:00.995
Okay,
but your window's closing.

32:01.031 --> 32:02.274
This doesn't
get wrapped up soon,

32:02.298 --> 32:05.033
your shot at being
a lawyer is over.

32:09.806 --> 32:11.472
If you're gonna
bankroll a suit,

32:11.508 --> 32:13.675
at least have the balls
to negotiate it yourself.

32:13.710 --> 32:15.110
I take it
you didn't like the offer.

32:15.145 --> 32:16.644
Admission of guilt
isn't an offer.

32:16.680 --> 32:17.979
It's suicide.

32:18.014 --> 32:19.847
It's Mike Ross' case,
it's his call.

32:19.883 --> 32:22.483
Bullshit.
Mike Ross is some clinic worker.

32:22.519 --> 32:25.086
You're Harvey Specter.
And from what I hear about you,

32:25.121 --> 32:26.788
you don't give a shit
about guilt.

32:26.823 --> 32:28.423
You're right, I don't.

32:28.458 --> 32:32.460
So why don't you tell me
how much it's gonna take

32:32.495 --> 32:35.129
to make this go away.
500 million.

32:35.165 --> 32:36.898
Half a billion dollars?
Are you insane?

32:36.933 --> 32:38.833
You poisoned your employees,
Mr. Palmer.

32:38.868 --> 32:40.146
You're lucky
you're not in prison.

32:40.170 --> 32:41.569
- 200 million.
- No.

32:41.604 --> 32:44.672
- 300
- No.

32:44.708 --> 32:48.042
Okay, make it 350
and call it a day.

32:48.078 --> 32:49.777
500.
Not a penny less.

32:49.813 --> 32:51.679
In that case,
make it zero

32:51.715 --> 32:54.916
because you just confirmed what
I suspected since this morning.

32:54.951 --> 32:57.585
You picked the exact number to
make my stock take a nosedive

32:57.620 --> 33:00.054
and we both know
who benefits from that.

33:00.090 --> 33:01.222
Craig Seidel.

33:01.257 --> 33:02.668
I don't know what
you're talking about.

33:02.692 --> 33:04.336
Then I guess you also don't
know that Mike Ross

33:04.360 --> 33:05.938
just got an appointment
with the ethics board

33:05.962 --> 33:08.930
and it's a crime
to trade this for that.

33:08.965 --> 33:12.100
Which means
your lawsuit is over.

33:12.135 --> 33:14.602
Then I'll do something else.

33:14.637 --> 33:15.837
You think I won't go after you

33:15.872 --> 33:18.306
for stealing technology
from Seidel's company?

33:18.341 --> 33:20.074
You have no proof
I did anything.

33:20.110 --> 33:21.275
No, but he does

33:21.311 --> 33:22.922
and I don't give
a shit about his marriage,

33:22.946 --> 33:24.323
and I'm going to make him
come forward.

33:24.347 --> 33:25.347
His marriage?

33:25.381 --> 33:27.215
Is that what
he told you this is about?

33:27.250 --> 33:29.183
Well, I've got news for you,
Mr. Specter,

33:29.219 --> 33:30.518
the reason
he hasn't come forward

33:30.553 --> 33:32.653
has nothing
to do with his marriage.

33:32.689 --> 33:35.456
So, why don't you go find out
what's what.

33:35.492 --> 33:37.525
And I got a feeling when you do,

33:37.560 --> 33:39.360
you'll drop this
case by the morning.

33:45.350 --> 33:48.252

[knocking]

33:55.828 --> 33:57.928
- Hey.

33:57.963 --> 33:59.696
You ran out
of the presentation so quickly,

33:59.732 --> 34:00.942
I didn't get to ask
what you thought.

34:00.966 --> 34:04.034
I had to get to class,
but I thought it went great.

34:04.069 --> 34:06.403
What about Louis?
He was over the Moon.

34:06.438 --> 34:08.705
I'm sure he's glad
to have you back.

34:08.741 --> 34:10.940
I'm glad to be back.

34:14.213 --> 34:15.489
- Well, I should, uh--
- What was it like

34:15.514 --> 34:17.648
working with my dad?

34:17.683 --> 34:20.150
You said it was a great pairing
and I was just wondering--

34:20.185 --> 34:23.553
- What you were missing.
- Yes.

34:23.589 --> 34:25.121
You were missing a brilliant,

34:25.157 --> 34:28.558
tireless, sweet, funny,
charming man.

34:28.594 --> 34:31.695
who may also be the best
litigator I've ever seen.

34:31.730 --> 34:33.797
Maybe you didn't understand
my question.

34:33.831 --> 34:36.733
I was asking what it was like
to work with Zane,

34:36.768 --> 34:40.270
not Kaldor.
Rachel, I'm serious.

34:40.306 --> 34:42.050
I learned a lot about
your father while I was there

34:42.074 --> 34:44.841
and I'm telling you,
it was all good.

34:44.877 --> 34:46.842
What about his temper?

34:46.879 --> 34:50.447
Well, maybe it wasn't
all good.

34:50.482 --> 34:53.784
Well, good night.

34:53.819 --> 34:58.188
One more thing
I learned about him.

34:58.223 --> 35:00.857
He doesn't just love you,
he respects you.

35:00.893 --> 35:03.171
- How would you know that--
- When he offered you that job,

35:03.195 --> 35:04.761
he was beaming.

35:04.797 --> 35:07.798
He told everyone in the office
that his brilliant baby girl

35:07.833 --> 35:09.399
was gonna work for us
and she was gonna

35:09.435 --> 35:11.535
blow us all to smithereens.

35:14.840 --> 35:17.007
- He said that?
- Rachel, I didn't tell you that

35:17.042 --> 35:19.009
to make you feel bad.

35:19.044 --> 35:22.145
He was okay
that you didn't take his offer.

35:22.181 --> 35:25.749
It doesn't make me feel bad.

35:25.784 --> 35:27.517
It makes me feel great.

35:35.828 --> 35:38.762
- Is he in?
- No, he had to run out.

35:38.797 --> 35:40.297
All right, do me a favor,

35:40.332 --> 35:44.167
just tell him I need to
talk to him when he gets back.

35:44.203 --> 35:47.504
You mind if I ask
what it's about?

35:47.539 --> 35:50.540
I just got off the phone
with Carly Donahue.

35:50.576 --> 35:52.253
Louis, what happened?
Rachel said that it went great.

35:52.277 --> 35:53.722
I thought it did, too,
but then she called me

35:53.746 --> 35:55.323
and said that the next time she
asks for a meeting

35:55.347 --> 35:56.958
with me and Harvey,
she better get a goddamn meeting

35:56.982 --> 35:59.349
with me and Harvey
instead of two nobodies.

35:59.385 --> 36:01.385
- What did you tell her?
- I told her how dare she

36:01.420 --> 36:02.819
talk about my superstars
like that.

36:02.855 --> 36:04.087
She's lucky to have them.

36:04.123 --> 36:05.400
Louis, that's great.
Good for you.

36:05.424 --> 36:08.492
She fired us, Donna.

36:08.527 --> 36:11.028
Oh, Louis, I'm so sorry.
Look, this isn't your fault.

36:11.063 --> 36:13.363
- You couldn't have known.
- It's okay.

36:13.399 --> 36:14.831
I just need to go home.

36:18.370 --> 36:20.771
[sighs]
Shit.

36:20.806 --> 36:22.205
<i>The Donna:</i>
<i>It's okay, Donna.</i>

36:22.241 --> 36:24.541
<i>It's not your fault, either.</i>
Yes, it is.

36:24.576 --> 36:26.109
I'm Donna,
I should have known.

36:26.145 --> 36:27.577
<i>The Donna:</i>
<i>Maybe, but you always say</i>

36:27.613 --> 36:29.980
<i>part of being human</i>
<i>is messing up sometimes</i>

36:30.015 --> 36:32.649
<i>and you may be Donna,</i>
<i>but you're still human.</i>

36:35.621 --> 36:38.722
Holy shit.

36:38.757 --> 36:40.924
You are ready.

36:48.801 --> 36:50.600
Oliver.

36:50.636 --> 36:53.336
Hey, what are you doing here?

36:53.372 --> 36:55.105
I want to know
if I was wrong about you.

36:55.140 --> 36:56.484
- What are you talking about?
- I wanna know

36:56.508 --> 36:59.009
if you're using this case
to get back to Pearson Specter.

36:59.044 --> 37:01.311
Oliver,
we talked about this.

37:01.346 --> 37:03.146
I thought you understood
that's not who I am.

37:03.182 --> 37:04.959
I thought so, too,
but then I got to thinking.

37:04.983 --> 37:06.683
You fooled so many people
for so long.

37:06.718 --> 37:08.251
What if you're fooling me now?

37:08.287 --> 37:10.353
Because you said Pearson Specter
would never take on

37:10.389 --> 37:12.000
a case like this when
you were there before.

37:12.024 --> 37:13.668
Yeah, because they never
wanted to be on the wrong side

37:13.692 --> 37:14.791
of a corporate lawsuit.

37:14.827 --> 37:16.337
Then why are they on
the wrong side of one now?

37:16.361 --> 37:19.629
- Oliver--
- Please, don't lie to me, Mike.

37:19.665 --> 37:21.531
Just tell me what's going on.

37:26.638 --> 37:30.240
It's a long story,
but we brought the suit

37:30.275 --> 37:32.142
so I that could
get into the Bar.

37:32.177 --> 37:34.522
So you were lying to Nathan,
only not about what he thought.

37:34.546 --> 37:35.924
- Listen to me--
- I'm not gonna listen

37:35.948 --> 37:37.525
and you need to tell him
what's going on.

37:37.549 --> 37:39.516
I can't do that
and I wasn't lying to him

37:39.551 --> 37:41.718
when I said I'm not going back
to my old firm.

37:41.753 --> 37:42.897
I wasn't lying to him
when I said

37:42.921 --> 37:44.287
these people's lives
matter to me

37:44.323 --> 37:46.356
and I wasn't lying to
either one of you when I said

37:46.391 --> 37:48.658
I care about what kind of lawyer
you're gonna be.

37:48.694 --> 37:50.438
Well, if you care what kind of
lawyer I'm going to be,

37:50.462 --> 37:53.363
set the right example

37:53.398 --> 37:56.066
because you owe it to Nathan
to tell him the truth.

38:05.410 --> 38:06.977
- Hi.
- Hey.

38:12.584 --> 38:14.217
What's this?

38:14.253 --> 38:16.786
It's every yearbook
I've ever had.

38:16.822 --> 38:18.533
It was so nice doing it
with yours the other night

38:18.557 --> 38:21.925
I thought maybe tonight we could
do it with mine.

38:21.960 --> 38:24.661
Louis, what's wrong?

38:28.634 --> 38:32.402
Nothing's wrong.
I, uh--had a bad day

38:32.437 --> 38:33.515
and I wanted to talk
to you about it.

38:33.539 --> 38:34.504
But you went to
all this trouble

38:34.540 --> 38:35.850
and I don't want
to bring you down.

38:35.874 --> 38:40.243
Louis, my yearbooks are always
gonna be here.

38:40.279 --> 38:43.246
And hearing about something as
important to you as your work

38:43.282 --> 38:45.115
isn't going to bring me down.

38:45.150 --> 38:47.250
It's going to bring us closer.

38:47.286 --> 38:51.821
Are you sure because I have
a lot of bad days at work.

38:51.857 --> 38:53.356
Which is all the more reason

38:53.392 --> 38:56.626
for you to have someone
to make you feel better at home.

38:59.498 --> 39:02.299
Okay, but it's kind of
a long story.

39:02.334 --> 39:04.634
Well then you sit right here,
I'll go make you a drink

39:04.670 --> 39:06.736
and then you can tell me
all about it.

39:06.772 --> 39:08.672
You know what
I'm in the mood for?

39:08.707 --> 39:11.074
I can't tell which one yet,
but I'm pretty sure its either

39:11.109 --> 39:14.211
a Peach Schnapps or a nice,
cold Prunie.

39:14.246 --> 39:15.890
You really are getting
to know me, aren't you?

39:15.914 --> 39:17.914
I sure am.

39:24.656 --> 39:26.223
[knocking]

39:28.393 --> 39:31.294
Jesus Christ.
What are you doing here?

39:31.330 --> 39:32.774
You guys told me to stay
away from you.

39:32.798 --> 39:34.264
Yeah, that was before
I had a chat

39:34.299 --> 39:35.665
with your buddy James Palmer.

39:35.701 --> 39:37.078
Look, I don't even know
James Palmer,

39:37.102 --> 39:38.246
so whatever he said--
He didn't have to

39:38.270 --> 39:40.036
say anything,
all he had to do was point.

39:43.442 --> 39:45.353
So what? This is an off-shore
account in my name.

39:45.377 --> 39:47.844
An off-shore account
with $300,000 in it,

39:47.879 --> 39:51.348
deposited exactly a day
after Velocity supposedly

39:51.383 --> 39:52.749
stole your technology.

39:52.784 --> 39:54.762
I was told by my accountant
to shelter certain earnings.

39:54.786 --> 39:56.953
Bullshit. You don't have
those kind of earnings.

39:56.989 --> 39:59.400
And you didn't have to keep this
quiet because you're married.

39:59.424 --> 40:01.858
You kept it quiet because
you're in on it.

40:01.893 --> 40:03.493
I was in on it.

40:03.528 --> 40:06.329
I saw a chance to jump ship
and get paid in the process.

40:06.365 --> 40:07.897
But instead,
they pulled the job

40:07.933 --> 40:10.111
and put just enough money
in that account to implicate me.

40:10.135 --> 40:12.769
- You piece of shit.
- Please, my employees

40:12.804 --> 40:14.315
are gonna lose their jobs
because of me.

40:14.339 --> 40:17.240
We need to keep this suit going
and get that technology back.

40:17.276 --> 40:18.908
Nuh-uh, buddy.

40:18.944 --> 40:20.644
You don't give a shit
about your employees

40:20.679 --> 40:22.245
and I don't give a shit
about you.

40:22.281 --> 40:23.658
This deal is done.
You can't do this.

40:23.682 --> 40:25.415
Yes, I can
and I didn't have

40:25.450 --> 40:27.417
leverage before,
but I have it now.

40:27.452 --> 40:29.352
So you're not just
getting Mike an interview,

40:29.388 --> 40:31.821
you're gonna block anyone
who tries to vote no.

40:31.857 --> 40:33.623
And if you don't,
your boss is gonna get

40:33.659 --> 40:36.760
an anonymous tip
that you sold trade secrets.

40:36.795 --> 40:38.573
And I'm gonna make sure to
send this along with it.

40:38.597 --> 40:39.974
You're my attorney.
You work for me.

40:39.998 --> 40:41.798
You can't do that.
I don't work for you.

40:41.833 --> 40:44.834
Remember, Craig?
That's how I set it up.

40:44.870 --> 40:46.269
See you at the Bar.
