03:48.320 --> 03:49.470

- [Grandma] Bridget, tell Mr. Dodge

07:36.120 --> 07:37.370
what you told me last night.

07:37.370 --> 07:39.520
- I don't know what I told you.

she said she wants to be

(ominous music)

08:30.600 --> 08:34.173
So are you going to pick up Carly?

08:36.090 --> 08:39.607
Carly Isle with the brown
hair and the freckles?

09:01.588 --> 09:05.546
- Did you know that he
married his student?

09:05.546 --> 09:06.470
- What?

09:06.470 --> 09:08.350
- It was a girl who was his student

09:08.350 --> 09:11.360
and then he married her
when she was a little older.

09:11.360 --> 09:13.170
But still, he knew her when she was young

09:13.170 --> 09:15.393
and then he married her.

09:17.070 --> 09:18.122
He's a creep.

09:18.122 --> 09:20.789
(ominous music)

09:48.310 --> 09:49.360
- You're Eddy, right?

09:50.338 --> 09:51.588
- [Eddy] Yeah.

09:52.460 --> 09:53.877
- I feel like I know everything about you.

09:53.877 --> 09:54.913
- Carly.
- Don't you live

09:54.913 --> 09:56.193
with your fiance?

09:57.090 --> 09:57.923
- I used to.

09:58.920 --> 10:00.020
- [Carly] Not anymore?

10:01.250 --> 10:02.640
- No.

10:02.640 --> 10:04.570
- Why?
- He just doesn't.

10:04.570 --> 10:06.270
He just moved here for the summer.

10:07.410 --> 10:09.660
- She basically had a
relationship with her boss

10:09.660 --> 10:10.900
who's 20 years older than her

10:10.900 --> 10:12.623
and married and has two kids.

10:15.140 --> 10:17.420
I went to his house at night
and smashed some windows

10:17.420 --> 10:18.570
and messed up his lawn.

10:29.938 --> 10:32.855
(traffic whirring)

10:34.304 --> 10:37.540
- Did you have a girlfriend
when you were our age?

10:37.540 --> 10:40.730
I'm just wondering because I
haven't had a boyfriend yet

10:40.730 --> 10:42.030
and neither has Bridgette.

10:43.350 --> 10:44.703
- [Eddy] I don't think that's a problem.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.310
- [Carly] But did you?

10:47.310 --> 10:48.410
When you were our age?

10:49.280 --> 10:51.083
- Yeah, I think so.

10:55.430 --> 10:56.263
- What happened?

10:58.843 --> 11:00.090
- I don't know. I don't really remember.

11:00.090 --> 11:01.240
It was a long time ago.

11:05.050 --> 11:06.350
- Do you want a boyfriend?

11:07.293 --> 11:08.600
- No, it sounds boring.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.260
- Yeah.

11:10.260 --> 11:11.610
And Annalise Billings got a boyfriend

11:11.610 --> 11:13.210
and now she's pregnant.

11:13.210 --> 11:14.163
And she's only 15.

11:18.370 --> 11:21.680
(boat motor buzzing)

11:21.680 --> 11:23.780
- [Carly] Someone one
time jumped from there,

11:23.780 --> 11:25.220
but she didn't know a boat was coming,

11:25.220 --> 11:26.550
so instead of landing in the water,

11:26.550 --> 11:27.890
she landed on the back of the boat.

11:27.890 --> 11:29.080
- It was really sad, actually.

11:29.080 --> 11:30.790
She broke both her legs and her arm.

11:30.790 --> 11:31.940
And now she's in a wheelchair

11:31.940 --> 11:33.350
- [Carly] I think she
landed on a guy in the boat,

11:33.350 --> 11:34.400
and he broke his arm.

11:36.390 --> 11:37.493
- Oh my God.

11:38.690 --> 11:39.853
Did you guys know her?

11:40.760 --> 11:42.270
- [Bridget] No.

11:42.270 --> 11:45.170
- Did you know Mr. Dodge is
gonna take me out on his boat?

11:47.520 --> 11:49.663
He does it with a group
of kids every summer.

11:51.350 --> 11:53.223
- Why didn't you tell me that before?

11:54.600 --> 11:55.433
- Forgot.

12:00.913 --> 12:03.913
(soft guitar music)

12:08.278 --> 12:09.994
(water spraying)
- Whoo!

12:09.994 --> 12:10.827

12:15.820 --> 12:18.820

12:55.819 --> 12:56.652
Um...

12:58.820 --> 12:59.803
There you go.
- Oh, yeah.

12:59.803 --> 13:01.564
I like this.

13:01.564 --> 13:03.397
- We'll keep that. Oh.

13:33.737 --> 13:34.654
- Do you...

13:36.650 --> 13:38.840
Do you have Arthur's phone number?

13:38.840 --> 13:40.190
- No.

13:40.190 --> 13:41.730
- He said he was getting phone calls

13:41.730 --> 13:43.300
in the middle of the night

13:43.300 --> 13:45.350
while we were at the conference together.

13:46.489 --> 13:49.406
- I don't know anything about that.

13:52.974 --> 13:57.974
(boat motors buzzing)
(birds chirping)

14:18.750 --> 14:21.300
Did you know Mr. Dodge
married one of his students?

14:22.953 --> 14:25.573
- (sighs) Well, she was older then.

14:27.370 --> 14:30.120
- Yeah, but it's still
kind of weird, isn't it?

14:30.120 --> 14:31.920
- Well they're not together anymore.

14:39.555 --> 14:42.472
(dishes clinking)

15:03.667 --> 15:06.681
- Are you gonna sleep here?

15:06.681 --> 15:08.264

16:57.280 --> 16:58.113
Grandma?

17:04.574 --> 17:07.324
(drill whirring)

17:10.377 --> 17:11.530
- Hey, Ed.

17:11.530 --> 17:12.363
- Hey.

17:14.118 --> 17:15.510
- Morning.

17:15.510 --> 17:16.343
- Good morning.

17:18.750 --> 17:19.583
What's going on?

17:21.280 --> 17:22.271
- Fixing the deck.

17:25.490 --> 17:26.740
What's going on with you?

17:32.210 --> 17:33.550
- Oh, well, ah...

17:34.541 --> 17:36.940
I'm not feeling great. Pretty tired.

17:36.940 --> 17:38.010
- Uh-huh.
- I think I'm gonna go

17:38.010 --> 17:40.018
lie down, actually.

17:40.018 --> 17:43.351

19:23.000 --> 19:24.670
- That's where we're
gonna work next summer.

19:24.670 --> 19:25.979
- Yeah.

19:25.979 --> 19:27.430
- You know that already?

19:27.430 --> 19:28.530
- I'm gonna work in checkout

19:28.530 --> 19:30.300
and Bridget's gonna work
at the meat counter.

19:30.300 --> 19:32.600
- No, I am not working the meat counter.

19:32.600 --> 19:33.823
- That's what they said.

19:37.530 --> 19:40.420
- [Eddy] Hey, the meat
counter doesn't sound so bad.

19:40.420 --> 19:42.020
You get to learn about

19:42.020 --> 19:44.650
all the different cuts of meat

19:45.870 --> 19:47.913
and butchering and stuff.

19:50.643 --> 19:52.510
- This is Seth , Debbie and Gayle,

19:52.510 --> 19:54.360
and all the big boys.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.193
And this was the old ballroom.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.790
- [Bridget] Where was it?

19:58.790 --> 19:59.623
- To the left.

20:00.623 --> 20:03.490
- Like right here?
- No, further to the left.

20:03.490 --> 20:04.833
- There.
- No, there.

20:04.833 --> 20:08.110
- [Weatherman On TV] Colder
than yesterday at this time.

20:08.110 --> 20:09.150
- [Bridget] Who's that?

20:09.150 --> 20:10.380
- That's Millie Turnbow.

20:10.380 --> 20:11.470
- [Weatherman] There's
a temperature trend.

20:11.470 --> 20:12.540
We'll have a...
- It's a funny story

20:12.540 --> 20:13.373
about Millie.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.590
In the winter time, they
would drive their cars

20:16.590 --> 20:18.883
out onto the ice and
they'd go ice fishing.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.800
So one night the whole town was there

20:21.800 --> 20:23.750
and he had this big party

20:23.750 --> 20:25.579
and Millie stayed in the car.

20:25.579 --> 20:26.670
- [Weatherman] So a 30 degree day...

20:26.670 --> 20:28.683
- The ice melted and the car fell in.

20:29.990 --> 20:31.520
- And no one
- Jesus.

20:31.520 --> 20:34.170
- could go and help her
because it was just too cold.

20:35.240 --> 20:37.640
So in the summer they
brought the coast guard

20:37.640 --> 20:39.200
and some scuba divers,

20:39.200 --> 20:40.910
but they never found her body.

20:40.910 --> 20:43.900
- [Weatherman] I do think we'll
warm up to about 44 to 45.

20:43.900 --> 20:45.013
A mix of sun and clouds.

20:45.013 --> 20:46.028
- [Bridget] How old was she?

20:46.028 --> 20:47.910
- Oh, she couldn't have been
much older than you two.

20:47.910 --> 20:49.220
Maybe 16?

20:49.220 --> 20:50.720
She was engaged to be married.

20:55.625 --> 20:58.292
(ominous music)

21:12.160 --> 21:14.167
- It's looking pretty
good if you wanna get in.

21:22.260 --> 21:23.093
Bridget?

21:28.000 --> 21:29.250
- I'm not swimming today.

21:32.350 --> 21:33.510
- No, really. It's pretty clear.

21:33.510 --> 21:34.810
I can see a few feet down.

21:41.470 --> 21:43.751
- What if I touch the bones?

21:43.751 --> 21:45.418
- [Eddy] What bones?

21:48.760 --> 21:51.530
- The bones of the girl who drowned.

21:51.530 --> 21:53.813
Millie Turnbow, who feel through the ice.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.363
(ominous music)

21:55.363 --> 21:58.530
(boat motor buzzing)

22:23.430 --> 22:25.310
Can we go out for a walk?

22:25.310 --> 22:26.143
- What?

22:27.298 --> 22:32.298
- Can we go for a walk?

22:32.735 --> 22:35.402
(ominous music)

22:43.832 --> 22:45.630
Can we go for a drive?

22:45.630 --> 22:46.913
- Where would we drive?

22:49.466 --> 22:51.901
- We could just drive around.

22:51.901 --> 22:54.568
(ominous music)

23:57.579 --> 23:58.486
Okay, stop.

23:58.486 --> 24:01.153
(ominous music)

24:08.370 --> 24:10.237
This is where Mr. Dodge lives.

24:12.671 --> 24:14.921
- He lives here by himself?

24:24.614 --> 24:26.186
(suspenseful music)

24:26.186 --> 24:27.402
What's that sound?

24:27.402 --> 24:29.312
(distant bellowing)

24:29.312 --> 24:30.729
- [Bridget] What?

24:40.896 --> 24:43.896

26:40.660 --> 26:43.260
I didn't know. I should
have, I should have knocked.

26:44.510 --> 26:45.850
- It's okay. You can come in.

26:45.850 --> 26:47.163
- [Bridget] Yeah, come in.

26:51.350 --> 26:52.183
- What's going on?

26:52.183 --> 26:54.010
- [Carly] Eddy, what do
you think of my shirt?

26:54.010 --> 26:55.130
Is it too loose?

26:55.130 --> 26:56.460
- Yeah, I don't like it.
- It's like a boy's shirt.

26:56.460 --> 26:58.233
- [Eddy] No, I think it looks good.

26:59.360 --> 27:00.860
- Why don't you try it on?

27:00.860 --> 27:02.510
- I bet it'll look better on you.

27:16.700 --> 27:19.330
- Um, where's Grandma?

27:19.330 --> 27:20.680
- She's at the beauty shop.

27:23.098 --> 27:24.515
Oh my God.

27:24.515 --> 27:26.854
That was so embarrassing.
(Carly laughing)

27:26.854 --> 27:28.647
Please don't ever do that again.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.190
- [Carly] (laughing) I'm sorry.

27:30.190 --> 27:32.460
(phone ringing)

27:32.460 --> 27:33.877
- [Bridget] Okay.

27:34.747 --> 27:36.158
- [Carly] I can't believe
he actually started

27:36.158 --> 27:37.752
undoing his shirt!

27:37.752 --> 27:39.486
- [Bridget] He seemed drunk.

27:39.486 --> 27:40.987
(phone continues ringing)

27:40.987 --> 27:42.787
- She doesn't keep her phone on her?

28:03.632 --> 28:05.030
- [Grandma] Hi, Eddy.

28:05.030 --> 28:06.680
- You forgot your phone.

28:06.680 --> 28:08.720
- Ah, yep. You're right, I did.

28:08.720 --> 28:10.570
- I brought it for you.

28:10.570 --> 28:12.670
- [Mr. Dodge] What's up, Eddy?

28:12.670 --> 28:13.587
- [Grandma] Do you wanna get in?

28:13.587 --> 28:14.753
- No, I'm gonna walk.

28:16.480 --> 28:18.880
- Hey Eddy, you got any
plans for later tonight?

28:20.208 --> 28:21.100
(Eddy sighs)

28:21.100 --> 28:23.120
I thought maybe we could
get a beer or something.

28:23.120 --> 28:25.953
(birds chirping)

28:27.180 --> 28:28.830
- Yeah, I'm not feeling too good.

28:30.450 --> 28:31.400
I'll see.

28:31.400 --> 28:33.260
- Well, let me know. All right?

28:33.260 --> 28:34.890
- Yeah, we'll see.

28:34.890 --> 28:36.313
- All right. I'll see you later.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.910
- Okay. Okay.

28:42.910 --> 28:44.490
Okay. Okay.

28:44.490 --> 28:46.163
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

28:49.822 --> 28:50.905
- Who's that?

28:52.280 --> 28:55.490
- Oh, um, Arthur.

28:55.490 --> 28:56.323
My boss.

29:02.750 --> 29:04.230
- I didn't know your
smell came from lotion.

29:04.230 --> 29:06.103
I thought it was perfume or something.

29:15.397 --> 29:18.564
(footsteps pattering)

29:20.445 --> 29:23.876
(Bridget and Carly laughing)

29:23.876 --> 29:25.133
- [Bridget] We have to
finish this before we leave.

29:25.133 --> 29:26.466
- [Carly] Okay.

29:29.250 --> 29:31.343
- [Bridget] Chug, chug, chug, chug!

29:32.352 --> 29:33.185
(Carly coughing)

29:33.185 --> 29:35.730
(Bridget chuckles)

29:35.730 --> 29:36.940
Carly, no way.

29:36.940 --> 29:38.100
Oh my God! No!

29:39.731 --> 29:40.935
(plastic crinkling)

29:40.935 --> 29:42.425
(Carly coughing)

29:42.425 --> 29:47.425
- Oh my God.

29:47.763 --> 29:49.836
- Bye, Grandma. Bye, Eddie.

29:49.836 --> 29:50.669
- Bye.

30:51.638 --> 30:52.721

30:55.889 --> 30:59.782
(ball clacks)
- That's Mark.

30:59.782 --> 31:01.032
- You know him?

31:02.941 --> 31:04.477
- Yep.

31:04.477 --> 31:05.483
- And the bartender?

31:09.600 --> 31:10.433
- Lisa.

31:23.509 --> 31:24.587
- Hi, Lisa.

31:24.587 --> 31:27.305
Get a couple of Coors Lights, please?

31:27.305 --> 31:30.722
(atmospheric rock music)

31:43.128 --> 31:45.593
Well, long time no see, son. How you been?

31:46.920 --> 31:48.370
- Hey, Bob.

31:48.370 --> 31:49.520
- [Bob] Who's this guy?

31:51.910 --> 31:55.293
- This is Eddie. He's
visiting from Chicago.

31:58.240 --> 31:59.720
- [Bob] Chi-Town, huh?

31:59.720 --> 32:01.160
- Wow, the nitty-gritty city.
- Whereabouts?

32:01.160 --> 32:02.660
Anywhere near Michigan Avenue?

32:05.470 --> 32:06.660
Christmas time we take the kids

32:06.660 --> 32:07.493
down to Michigan Avenue, look at the...

32:07.493 --> 32:09.440

you've been the same person

32:43.950 --> 32:45.193
your entire life?

32:47.120 --> 32:50.780

experiment that's like,

32:50.780 --> 32:52.030
if you have an ax

32:54.150 --> 32:56.170
and you replace the head of ax

32:56.170 --> 32:58.280
and then you replace the handle of the ax,

32:58.280 --> 32:59.803
is it the same ax?

33:01.460 --> 33:03.133

Grandma, can we get school supplies today?

36:46.197 --> 36:47.763

37:04.780 --> 37:06.420

37:11.744 --> 37:14.744

37:22.552 --> 37:24.250

37:24.250 --> 37:27.850
Just think of the smell of new notebooks

helping me out with some stuff.

38:51.562 --> 38:54.645
(suspenseful music)

39:00.150 --> 39:01.550
Looking for something, Eddy?

39:02.650 --> 39:04.290
- Oh yeah, just looking
for the girls books.

39:04.290 --> 39:06.440
Where are they?
- I have 'em in the bedroom.

39:06.440 --> 39:07.990
Let me grab 'em.
- I can check.

39:07.990 --> 39:10.972
- I can grab 'em. Just
tell me where they are.

39:10.972 --> 39:12.242
- All right.

39:12.242 --> 39:14.100
Second bedroom on the left,

39:14.100 --> 39:15.240
in a box on the floor,

39:15.240 --> 39:16.397
there's about seven or
eight copies of 'em.

39:16.397 --> 39:18.230
All right?

39:18.230 --> 39:19.590
Should be able to find 'em no problem.

39:19.590 --> 39:21.950
- I can pack a lunch for
the boat if you want.

39:21.950 --> 39:23.113
I can make sandwiches.

39:24.320 --> 39:26.500
- Okay, um, but I don't know

39:26.500 --> 39:27.490
if we're gonna have time for lunch though.

39:27.490 --> 39:30.763
- I'm so excited.
- Forget it.

39:31.940 --> 39:33.073
- [Mr. Dodge] Bridget,
you're not gonna go?

39:33.073 --> 39:34.352
- [Bridget] No, I can't make it.

39:34.352 --> 39:36.558
(intense music)

39:36.558 --> 39:38.141
- [Mr. Dodge] Okay.

40:03.418 --> 40:05.050
- [Reporter On TV] In serious condition.

40:05.050 --> 40:06.792
Now investigators have also talked

40:06.792 --> 40:08.872
to family members here at the scene.

40:08.872 --> 40:10.821
They say the two women from the car

40:10.821 --> 40:14.574
apparently live in a
neighborhood not far from here.

40:14.574 --> 40:16.839
Again, they're trying to
compile all of the information

40:16.839 --> 40:18.542
that they can at this point.

40:18.542 --> 40:21.823
What investigators have
been able to tell us also...

40:21.823 --> 40:25.800
- What was it like? The
thing with your fiance?

40:25.800 --> 40:29.898
Not like when it was bad, but like before.

40:29.898 --> 40:31.939
- [Reporter] Were recently
added, there has been...

40:31.939 --> 40:33.184
(Eddy breathes heavily)

40:33.184 --> 40:34.890
And some of the people
driving through these...

40:34.890 --> 40:38.158
- It was good and nice.

40:38.158 --> 40:38.991
- [Reporter] By the traffic lights...

40:38.991 --> 40:40.800
But I don't think I was very good at it.

40:40.800 --> 40:42.823
- [Reporter] Now joining
us live is Captain Rita...

40:42.823 --> 40:45.543
- I could never really get
used to her being there.

40:47.020 --> 40:49.040
Like she was definitely
used to me being there,

40:49.040 --> 40:53.513
but I can never just forget about her.

40:54.820 --> 40:57.420
I think you need to be able
to forget about someone.

40:58.840 --> 41:01.310
Forget that they're there.
- Talking to the IMPD...

41:01.310 --> 41:03.293
- You have to forget that they're there?

41:03.293 --> 41:04.459
- [Reporter] Brand new lighting system in

41:04.459 --> 41:05.940
for the area travelers...
- Yeah, like

41:05.940 --> 41:08.659
if you care about them, give them space.

41:08.659 --> 41:10.292
- [Reporter] This scene
is a little bit confusing,

41:10.292 --> 41:11.707
and so that would be something the...

41:11.707 --> 41:13.493
- You're like really sweet.

41:14.610 --> 41:16.711
You like really care.

41:16.711 --> 41:18.912
- [Reporter] System has only
been up this way about a month,

41:18.912 --> 41:20.802
and, you know, until
people get used to it,

41:20.802 --> 41:21.872
it's just a little confusing.

41:21.872 --> 41:24.443
That's basically what the
witnesses are telling them.

41:24.443 --> 41:26.440
So at this point, we really
don't have any information

41:26.440 --> 41:27.872
about what caused it.

41:27.872 --> 41:30.487
That just an additional
confirming of the incident.

41:30.487 --> 41:33.154
(ominous music)

42:10.783 --> 42:13.450
(intense music)

42:15.840 --> 42:20.099
- [Katherine] Okay, so
looking at the list,

42:20.099 --> 42:23.515
we when in everybody from high school,

42:23.515 --> 42:26.848
we're gonna be hitting around a hundred.

42:32.048 --> 42:34.290
- [Eddy] Yeah, that's sounds right.

42:34.290 --> 42:35.240
- [Katherine] Um, I guess like just

42:35.240 --> 42:36.450
the planning on your end.

42:36.450 --> 42:39.047
What's going on with honeymoon search?

42:40.260 --> 42:42.873
- Um, I am renting a boat.

42:43.944 --> 42:46.611
(intense music)

43:22.180 --> 43:23.646
- [Bridget] Hey, do you
wanna go out tonight?

43:23.646 --> 43:27.410
- Oh, I can't. I have my first
shift at the grocery store.

43:27.410 --> 43:30.710
- What? We're starting that next year.

43:30.710 --> 43:32.120
- Oh, yeah. My dad talked to the manager.

43:32.120 --> 43:34.560
And he got me a position at
checkout for this summer.

43:34.560 --> 43:37.014
- [Bridget] Okay, but what about me?

43:37.014 --> 43:39.410
- (sighs) Don't, Bridget.

43:39.410 --> 43:41.548
- Carly.
- No, I...

43:41.548 --> 43:42.485
- Come on.

43:42.485 --> 43:45.152
(intense music)

44:07.680 --> 44:08.513
- Ed.

44:46.595 --> 44:48.012
Answer the phone.

45:06.074 --> 45:11.074
(water sloshing)
(birds chirping)

45:22.657 --> 45:25.324
(motor buzzing)

45:30.879 --> 45:34.212
(dramatic guitar music)

46:32.660 --> 46:35.493
(scanner beeping)

47:05.185 --> 47:08.602
(indistinct chattering)

47:15.780 --> 47:16.613
- Hi.

47:17.710 --> 47:19.360
- Hi.

47:19.360 --> 47:23.230
Sorry. I just need a cantaloupe.

47:23.230 --> 47:24.577
My grandma loves 'em.

47:28.814 --> 47:30.790
Is everything okay?

47:30.790 --> 47:32.390
- Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine.

47:33.541 --> 47:38.140
(indistinct chattering) (scanner beeping)

47:38.140 --> 47:40.223
- Did you go on the boat with Dodge?

47:41.458 --> 47:45.793
- Okay. It's gonna be $2.45.

47:47.440 --> 47:50.163
- Oh, you know what? I forgot my wallet.

47:56.440 --> 47:58.390
Can you just tell me that you won't go?

48:00.780 --> 48:01.613
- But why?

48:03.180 --> 48:05.523
- I just don't think it's a smart idea.

48:10.133 --> 48:13.165
(Carly laughing)

48:13.165 --> 48:15.130
What?

48:15.130 --> 48:15.963
What?

48:17.318 --> 48:18.818
- Are you jealous?

48:21.477 --> 48:24.727
(intense guitar music)

49:25.105 --> 49:26.381
(door opens)

49:26.381 --> 49:27.535
(keys jangling)

49:27.535 --> 49:30.118
(door closes)

49:37.323 --> 49:39.193
- It's like a rainforest in here.

49:41.060 --> 49:43.210
- The air is so dry,
it was making me sick.

49:48.630 --> 49:50.093
- You're not wearing your ring.

50:09.102 --> 50:12.269
(gentle guitar music)

50:20.117 --> 50:21.613
"Without the gate, we stood agaze,

50:21.613 --> 50:23.614
fearful to break that quiet

50:23.614 --> 50:24.590
and to creep into the home that...

50:24.590 --> 50:25.450
Fearful to break...

50:25.450 --> 50:26.790
Strangers without the gate....

50:26.790 --> 50:28.060
We stood agaze... Into the home....

50:28.060 --> 50:30.809
Fearful to break that
quiet and to creep...

50:30.809 --> 50:32.531
Into the home that had been ours to keep.

50:32.531 --> 50:35.342
Into the home that had been ours to keep."

50:35.342 --> 50:38.342
(soft guitar music)

50:40.205 --> 50:41.240
- [Katherine] I don't
wanna be the reason why

50:41.240 --> 50:42.573
you can't sleep.

50:49.557 --> 50:51.977
- "Within its walls, were
sleeping in our bed."

50:55.690 --> 50:56.523
- Who wrote that?

50:57.920 --> 50:59.633
- Wilfred Wilson Gibson.

51:01.240 --> 51:02.073
- Why?

51:03.290 --> 51:05.323
- Just like to know
the name of who did it.

51:08.390 --> 51:09.627
Read another by him.

51:19.230 --> 51:21.897
(ominous music)

51:46.040 --> 51:49.800
(hot dogs sizzling)

51:49.800 --> 51:53.537
- Just move the meat
over to this side here.

51:58.030 --> 51:59.123
You want it to be,

52:00.289 --> 52:01.460
you know, nice and hot.

52:01.460 --> 52:03.440
Almost like if you were to get a,

52:03.440 --> 52:05.403
feel a slight burn on your face.

52:06.557 --> 52:08.050
You know what I mean?

52:08.050 --> 52:11.217
(boat motor buzzing)

52:20.700 --> 52:22.850
- What are your plans
before school starts?

52:24.290 --> 52:26.040
- The only thing I wanna do

52:26.040 --> 52:27.450
is take my boat out on the water

52:27.450 --> 52:28.450
as much as possible.

52:31.813 --> 52:33.540
You know, Bridge, it's, um,

52:33.540 --> 52:36.003
it's too bad you can't join us out there.

52:37.644 --> 52:39.060
- I know.

52:39.060 --> 52:40.440
- I can't wait wait.

52:47.980 --> 52:49.740
- [Mr. Dodge] The pasta salad's great.

52:49.740 --> 52:51.060
Did you make it?

52:51.060 --> 52:52.230
- It's store bought?

52:52.230 --> 52:54.770
I bought it from the grocery store.

52:54.770 --> 52:55.653
I work there now.

52:56.650 --> 52:57.500
- [Mr. Dodge] Oh.

53:01.830 --> 53:04.340
- How are the hot dogs?
Are the hot dogs okay?

53:04.340 --> 53:06.560
I didn't really know what
I was doing out there.

53:06.560 --> 53:08.123
- [Grandma] They're great, Eddy.

53:09.278 --> 53:11.116
- [Mr. Dodge] You were great out there.

53:11.116 --> 53:15.289
Eddy, I must say you
grilled 'em to perfection.

53:15.289 --> 53:17.956
(ominous music)

54:35.756 --> 54:37.089
- Did you sleep?

54:40.737 --> 54:41.823
- No, only dreams.

54:45.890 --> 54:47.090
- I didn't sleep at all.

54:51.018 --> 54:52.618
I think I'm getting it from you.

54:55.762 --> 54:58.512
(birds chirping)

55:06.218 --> 55:07.850
- What day is it?

55:07.850 --> 55:08.683
- Saturday.

55:31.047 --> 55:33.797
(ominous music)

56:02.110 --> 56:04.360
- I think he's gonna do
something really bad.

56:06.739 --> 56:07.739
- Like what?

56:09.992 --> 56:11.870
- I don't know. It could be anything.

56:11.870 --> 56:13.787
I just don't trust him.

56:17.259 --> 56:18.926
- [Grandma] Bridget?

56:21.891 --> 56:22.724
Bridget!

56:22.724 --> 56:25.724
(suspenseful music)

57:17.213 --> 57:19.880
(motor buzzing)

57:59.581 --> 58:02.331
(water sloshing)

59:21.973 --> 59:25.297
(motor clattering)

59:25.297 --> 59:28.047
(ominous music)

59:59.940 --> 01:00:01.940
We're gonna need someone to come get us.

01:00:03.042 --> 01:00:06.042
(suspenseful music)

01:00:44.371 --> 01:00:47.038
(motor buzzing)

01:01:35.626 --> 01:01:38.376
(metal scraping)

01:02:41.811 --> 01:02:45.728
- [Bridget] What were
you guys doing out there?

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:57.247
Can you stop for a second?

01:03:03.074 --> 01:03:05.657
(door beeping)

01:03:14.668 --> 01:03:16.260
(door closes)

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:18.927
(Carly crying)

01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:55.000
- Eddy, Eddy.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.690
I am so, so sorry.

01:03:57.690 --> 01:04:00.740
I can't believe that I
let that happen out there.

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:03.003
Really. I am really sorry.

01:04:06.885 --> 01:04:09.635
(water sloshing)

01:04:42.144 --> 01:04:43.290
- [Katherine Voicemail Message] Hey, Eddy.

01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:45.900
There's still three bags here of yours.

01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:47.500
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put them

01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:51.483
in the storage unit that's
off of Diversey and Racine.

01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:55.130
And then you can pick it
up whenever you're ready.

01:04:55.130 --> 01:04:56.030
I'll give you the code.

01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:59.480
Just give me a call back and let me know.

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:00.444
Thanks.

01:05:00.444 --> 01:05:03.611
(motor boat buzzing)

01:05:33.110 --> 01:05:33.943
- Hello?

01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:38.413
Hello?

01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:43.053
Hello.

01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:47.263
- Eddy.
- Hi.

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:52.460
- [Katherine] How are you?

01:05:54.370 --> 01:05:55.203
- I'm okay.

01:05:58.190 --> 01:06:00.170
- [Katherine] That's good.

01:06:00.170 --> 01:06:01.120
That's really good.

01:06:03.770 --> 01:06:04.603
- How are you?

01:06:08.257 --> 01:06:09.907
- [Katherine] I'm doing good too.

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:13.183
So you're really doing well?

01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:24.993
- Yeah. I'm not going on my phone as much.

01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:28.110
And I'm getting a lot of sun.

01:06:29.830 --> 01:06:30.780
I feel really good.

01:06:33.399 --> 01:06:35.199
- Good. I know how you like the sun.

01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:38.883
- Yeah, it's okay.

01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:43.510
I'm probably getting too much actually.

01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:50.200
But anyway, I'm helping
my cousin with some stuff.

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.750
We're figuring some things out.

01:06:54.030 --> 01:06:56.430
She's got this situation with a teacher,

01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:59.850
who's got some really
deep rooted issues with-

01:06:59.850 --> 01:07:01.683
- Eddy. Eddy.

01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:04.013
- Yeah?

01:07:06.688 --> 01:07:10.757
- Things don't have to
be bad or inevitable.

01:07:10.757 --> 01:07:13.924
(motor boat buzzing)

01:07:35.043 --> 01:07:36.730
- I like staring at lakes

01:07:36.730 --> 01:07:38.430
because you can't get lost in 'em.

01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:41.910
Whenever I've looked at the ocean,

01:07:41.910 --> 01:07:44.023
the land just kind of fades away.

01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:48.730
I really liked being on a lake.

01:08:05.254 --> 01:08:08.254
(suspenseful music)

01:09:24.969 --> 01:09:28.051
(tomatoes squishing)

01:09:53.327 --> 01:09:54.940
- I know you like the sun.

01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:57.940
(suspenseful music)

01:10:04.013 --> 01:10:06.096
Can you smell the lotion?

01:10:09.791 --> 01:10:12.124
Things don't have to be bad.

01:10:13.947 --> 01:10:15.004
Or inevitable.

01:10:15.004 --> 01:10:17.671
(intense music)

01:10:26.068 --> 01:10:26.901
It's okay.

01:10:29.487 --> 01:10:30.904
It's really okay.

01:12:30.530 --> 01:12:32.070
- Did you call her?

01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:32.903
- Yes.

01:12:33.930 --> 01:12:34.780
- What'd she say?

01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:38.202
- She hung up on me.

01:12:39.925 --> 01:12:41.838
- Then why are you still
holding the phone like that?

01:12:41.838 --> 01:12:44.505
(intense music)

01:15:46.182 --> 01:15:47.454
- [Carly Voicemail] Hey, it's Carly.

01:15:47.454 --> 01:15:48.672
Talk to you soon.

01:15:48.672 --> 01:15:51.339
