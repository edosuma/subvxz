[narrator]
Previously on Chesapeake Shores:

00:02.752 --> 00:03.586
[Mick] Trace.

00:03.670 --> 00:06.756
I've tried to call Abby,
but we haven't connected.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.717
Trace, I'm sure Abby got your message.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.219
For you.
I didn't know if you'd wanna talk or not.

00:11.302 --> 00:14.681
Dilpher's been indicted. He's named me
a co-conspirator in his fraud case.

00:14.764 --> 00:19.102
Says I authorized substandard foundations
in close to 200 buildings.

00:19.185 --> 00:21.062
-It's over with Trace.
-I know.

00:21.146 --> 00:23.815
Because we have history
does not mean we have a future.

00:23.898 --> 00:25.150
[Jay] I know that too.

00:25.233 --> 00:28.069
Sometimes, the past has a way
of sticking around.

00:28.153 --> 00:29.988
[Kevin]
We wanted to apologize for eloping.

00:30.071 --> 00:31.656
It might not have been the right thing.

00:31.740 --> 00:36.870
Nelson is a shark, and she'll attack
when you least expect it.

00:36.953 --> 00:39.205
-Yes!
-Wait, let me ask.

00:39.289 --> 00:42.667
-Will you marry me?
-Yes! A thousand times yes!

00:44.043 --> 00:46.212
[Bree] I wanna thank you for taking me on.

00:46.296 --> 00:47.797
You're really gonna like what I say.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.799
Want to take your play to the West End?

00:49.883 --> 00:50.884
-London?
-Yep.

00:50.967 --> 00:51.926
Thank you!

00:52.469 --> 00:55.263
Abby, listen. I'm not going anywhere.

00:55.346 --> 00:57.348
-I'm not giving up on us.
-Trace...

01:02.520 --> 01:04.898
[Kevin]
Yeah, a little bit up on the right side.

01:04.981 --> 01:07.776
Great, and now a little up
on the left side.

01:07.859 --> 01:11.988
Up a little bit more on the right side.
Yeah, up again on the left.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.449
-Kev, are you messing with us?
-Absolutely.

01:14.532 --> 01:16.951
-[laughing]
-It looks fine, girls.

01:17.535 --> 01:19.454
[Megan] Oh, that is one awesome banner.

01:19.537 --> 01:22.123
Isn't it amazing?
Can you believe Carrie made this?

01:22.207 --> 01:23.792
-[Megan] Wow, she's got a gift.
-Mm-hmm.

01:23.875 --> 01:28.254
Are we sure Bree's gonna be happy
with all this? The hats, the high tea?

01:28.338 --> 01:32.342
When I FaceTimed her, she wanted
a low-key homecoming. Nothing grand.

01:32.967 --> 01:33.802
This is it?

01:34.385 --> 01:36.054
-Hey!
-Yay!

01:36.137 --> 01:37.972
Welcome home, honey!

01:38.556 --> 01:39.516
Hi!

01:40.934 --> 01:42.352
Look at that face!

01:42.435 --> 01:44.354
You're supposed to be back in three hours.

01:44.437 --> 01:46.981
I caught an earlier flight.
I wanted to surprise you.

01:47.065 --> 01:50.276
Oh, Nell is gonna be so sorry
she missed your entrance.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.195
She's at the market getting you tea.

01:53.404 --> 01:55.740
Not more tea.
I've had enough tea for a lifetime.

01:55.824 --> 01:58.326
Your grandmother is making high tea,

01:58.409 --> 02:01.663
with scones and cucumber sandwiches
and everything to welcome you home.

02:01.746 --> 02:03.123
So you are having tea.

02:03.206 --> 02:05.875
Okay, all right, for Gran, I'll have tea.

02:06.876 --> 02:09.712
For now, can I have a good old cup
of Maryland coffee, though?

02:09.796 --> 02:12.006
-That you can have.
-[Bree] Thank you.

02:12.715 --> 02:15.009
Oh! Give me that.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.052
I missed that.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.472
[all laughing]

02:19.556 --> 02:21.766
-You must be exhausted.
-Yeah.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.310
You know what? It feels like I never left.

02:25.061 --> 02:28.982
It also feels like I've been gone
for a million years. Catch me up.

02:29.607 --> 02:33.194
You know everything. We FaceTimed
so much, I almost wore out my phone.

02:33.278 --> 02:35.071
Oh, I had to get a new one.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.615
-Connor still happy at the law firm?
-He's doing great.

02:37.699 --> 02:39.951
David and I are going crazy
planning the wedding.

02:40.034 --> 02:41.202
-Good crazy?
-Yes.

02:41.286 --> 02:42.328
All good.

02:42.412 --> 02:43.580
And Mom and Dad?

02:44.330 --> 02:47.083
They are spending a lot of time together.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.253
So weird. It's interesting, but weird.

02:50.837 --> 02:53.339
-And you?
-Me? I'm good.

02:53.423 --> 02:54.507
Really?

02:54.591 --> 02:58.261
You haven't mentioned Trace,
Jay, or anybody really.

02:58.887 --> 03:02.307
-No, there's not much to report.
-She never talks about it.

03:02.891 --> 03:05.852
That's because there's more
to my life than men.

03:05.935 --> 03:08.313
And I'm focusing on myself for once.

03:08.396 --> 03:10.523
I'm working with Dad.
What's wrong with that?

03:10.607 --> 03:12.859
-Nothing.
-No, it's totally fine.

03:12.942 --> 03:15.028
I've been concentrating on work too, so...

03:15.737 --> 03:18.197
It's just that it gets boring, right?

03:19.490 --> 03:22.035
Well, I prefer to think of it
as empowering.

03:22.118 --> 03:23.745
Okay, fine.

03:26.497 --> 03:28.416
-I just thought that...
-What?

03:29.208 --> 03:33.087
I thought something happened
between you and Trace, before I left.

03:33.171 --> 03:36.174
After Kevin and Sarah's wedding dinner.

04:01.950 --> 04:02.784
[Bree] Abby.

04:04.869 --> 04:07.830
-Nell's here with the tea.
-Tea! Okay.

04:11.125 --> 04:12.543
Almost got her talking.

04:12.627 --> 04:13.503
So close.

04:15.046 --> 04:16.089
I blame the tea.

05:33.750 --> 05:36.085
-You're not tired of that yet?
-Not yet.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.130
Do you know what today is?

05:40.923 --> 05:41.883
Monday?

05:41.966 --> 05:43.760
Yes. And?

05:46.637 --> 05:47.472
Tell me.

05:47.555 --> 05:50.183
It is our two-month
and three-week anniversary.

05:50.975 --> 05:54.062
-Is that a thing?
-Well, it could be. Here.

05:55.104 --> 05:56.355
Oh, coffee.

06:00.234 --> 06:04.530
So is this the traditional two-month,
three-week anniversary gift?

06:04.614 --> 06:06.324
I think that it is, yeah.

06:09.535 --> 06:12.246
Just think.
You could be pregnant right now.

06:12.330 --> 06:13.414
I could be.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.918
And if it's a boy,

06:17.001 --> 06:20.338
I was thinking we could give it
a really strong Irish name like Finbarr.

06:21.339 --> 06:22.173
Finbarr?

06:22.924 --> 06:25.843
Yeah, or Ultan,
if Finbarr is a little weird.

06:25.927 --> 06:29.347
Really? Ultan or Finbarr?

06:29.889 --> 06:34.060
-If it's a boy. If it's a girl--
-I think you're gonna be a great dad.

06:36.562 --> 06:40.525
But just...
leave the naming up to me, okay?

06:51.536 --> 06:53.246
I see you're hard at work.

06:53.996 --> 06:57.458
Hey, Linda. Diving deep
into unfair wage discrimination.

06:57.542 --> 07:00.336
-Thank you for letting me be on this case.
-You're doing well.

07:00.419 --> 07:02.922
I should have all of this
to you by tomorrow afternoon.

07:03.005 --> 07:06.217
That's fine. Margaret, come in.

07:07.260 --> 07:10.888
Connor O'Brien, lawyer extraordinaire,
Margaret Keller, paralegal extraordinaire.

07:10.972 --> 07:14.684
Nice to meet you.
Hey, let me help you with that.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.770
These the 1963 Equal Pay Act files?

07:17.854 --> 07:20.690
Hope so, otherwise I'll be stripped
of my extraordinaire title.

07:23.484 --> 07:26.612
Keep up the good work, Connor.
You've already impressed the partners.

07:26.696 --> 07:29.490
Even Bobby Lewis.
And he doesn't like anybody.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.870
-That's true, he hates me.
-Oh, that's not true.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.914
-Oh, is that a picture of your family?
-Yes, it is.

07:36.998 --> 07:39.333
I come from a big family too.
Second from the last.

07:39.917 --> 07:40.835
Me too.

07:41.419 --> 07:43.838
Always caught in the middle?
Taken a bit for granted?

07:43.921 --> 07:47.592
-Yeah. But I could get away with a lot.
-I know what you mean.

07:47.675 --> 07:49.469
[both laughing]

07:49.552 --> 07:54.140
-Well, nice to meet you, Mr. O'Brien.
-Thanks. And it's Connor.

07:55.933 --> 07:58.895
You know,
it's a big deal that Lewis likes you.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.816
Yes!

08:12.783 --> 08:13.618
Absolutely.

08:14.327 --> 08:18.414
Yeah, thank you. I look forward
to meeting with you. Okay, bye-bye.

08:19.790 --> 08:21.626
I want to know about that call.

08:21.709 --> 08:24.754
But first, I need some guest room
amenities for David's parents.

08:24.837 --> 08:26.881
Oh, David's parents are coming?

08:26.964 --> 08:31.093
Yes, and I'm trying to be
as positive as possible about it.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.763
So I need stationery, notepads, and pens.

08:33.846 --> 08:37.558
-Like we're a real bed and breakfast.
-Jess, you are a real bed and breakfast.

08:37.642 --> 08:40.311
-Keep telling me that.
-Why are you nervous?

08:41.479 --> 08:45.441
-We have some news to break to them.
-What news?

08:45.525 --> 08:47.276
It'll keep. What was your call?

08:48.569 --> 08:50.488
That was the University of Maryland.

08:50.571 --> 08:52.073
Did you forget to finish a class?

08:52.156 --> 08:54.575
Taking back your degree?
I have nightmares about that.

08:54.659 --> 08:58.996
No, they want me
to be a playwright in residence.

08:59.747 --> 09:01.874
That's great. What is that?

09:01.958 --> 09:06.379
That means that I would be teaching
Creative Writing for a semester.

09:06.462 --> 09:09.882
-Wow. Are you gonna do it?
-I don't know.

09:09.966 --> 09:14.178
I mean, I've thought about teaching.
It would be nice to give back, or--

09:14.845 --> 09:17.139
-No.
-What?

09:17.223 --> 09:20.560
Guess who's head
of the Humanities Department at U of M.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.061
-Tell me.
-Jerome Trask.

09:22.144 --> 09:22.979
-No!
-Yes!

09:23.062 --> 09:26.440
-I don't know who that is.
-Jess, my high school nemesis.

09:26.524 --> 09:29.860
-You had a nemesis?
-Yes, I-- It was Jerome Trask.

09:29.944 --> 09:34.115
He was awful. Head of the debate team,
and he would never let me join.

09:34.198 --> 09:36.117
You were mad you couldn't join

09:36.200 --> 09:40.162
the debate club, not the cheerleading
squad or the basketball team?

09:40.246 --> 09:42.164
Don't judge. High school was a rough time.

09:42.248 --> 09:45.835
I thought I'm the only one who had trouble
in high school. You got straight A's.

09:45.918 --> 09:50.798
Yeah, academically I did fine.
But socially, not so much.

09:52.216 --> 09:53.217
You never let on.

09:53.301 --> 09:56.095
Well, you had enough to worry about.

09:56.178 --> 09:57.430
I could have helped.

09:57.513 --> 10:00.266
You did, just by being you.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.059
Aw.

10:06.981 --> 10:11.110
Okay. Amenities are in place.
How long until your folks get here?

10:11.193 --> 10:13.112
-Right about now.
-Oh, boy.

10:13.988 --> 10:17.033
-We shouldn't have had them stay here.
-No. They need to stay here.

10:17.116 --> 10:19.785
-Right. They need to see our business.
-And respect it.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.162
Well, baby steps.

10:21.245 --> 10:24.290
This is our life. We ought to be able
to live it the way we want to.

10:24.373 --> 10:28.628
Yes, which is why we'll tell them
our decision in a room full of people.

10:28.711 --> 10:31.964
-So they don't make a scene?
-Exactly. They hate scenes.

10:32.048 --> 10:34.675
-That actually sounds like a good idea.
-I thought so too.

10:34.759 --> 10:36.677
[doorbell rings]

10:36.761 --> 10:37.595
Showtime.

10:40.264 --> 10:41.682
Ah! David.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.601
-Jess.
-Hello.

10:43.684 --> 10:49.190
Well, I can tell you, it wasn't easy,
but we finally found the place.

10:49.273 --> 10:51.233
-Yes.
-Come on in.

10:51.776 --> 10:54.153
Oh, would you have your bellboy
bring our bags in?

10:54.236 --> 10:56.155
Oh, uh, I'll do that.

10:56.238 --> 11:00.576
My. I can see how some people
might find this place very charming.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.036
Thank you.

11:02.119 --> 11:03.454
And so it begins.

11:14.924 --> 11:15.883
Hey.

11:15.966 --> 11:19.762
Ooh! Chocolate chip mint.
Exactly what I wanted.

11:19.845 --> 11:22.223
Yeah, well, sometimes moms get it right.

11:26.519 --> 11:30.481
I want you to know that I'm here
for you if you wanna talk about it.

11:31.982 --> 11:36.070
And I'm also here for you
if you don't wanna talk about it.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.531
Thanks, Mom.

11:47.039 --> 11:50.000
That was a kiss goodbye, wasn't it?

11:53.796 --> 11:56.173
We can't keep doing this to each other.

11:56.257 --> 11:58.926
We can't live in the past.
We're not the same people.

11:59.009 --> 12:02.638
I'm not living in the past.
I'm talking about the future, our future.

12:02.721 --> 12:07.226
You say that, but I also need to think
about my daughters and their future.

12:07.309 --> 12:08.769
I love your girls.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.355
Yeah, I know you do.

12:11.981 --> 12:15.484
Abby... you're just scared.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.070
Yeah, I am scared. It's scary.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.574
You've never been married before, Trace.
I have.

12:21.657 --> 12:24.410
The divorce,
it was devastating for the girls.

12:24.493 --> 12:25.911
What if we break up again?

12:25.995 --> 12:29.123
That's not gonna happen. Okay?
We're not gonna break up this time.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.542
It's not that simple. You know that.

12:32.585 --> 12:36.630
You don't think it's that simple
because you overcomplicate things.

12:36.714 --> 12:37.548
Fine.

12:38.549 --> 12:40.509
But you deserve to be happy, and so do I,

12:40.593 --> 12:43.387
and this back and forth
doesn't make me happy.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.807
-I don't think it makes you happy either.
-No.

12:46.891 --> 12:49.852
No, right now, I'm not happy.
I'm not happy at all.

12:56.692 --> 12:57.568
It's melting.

12:58.319 --> 12:59.778
[chuckles]

13:06.827 --> 13:07.870
-Okay.
-Okay.

13:08.704 --> 13:12.625
No, I think you need to go up two lengths.

13:12.708 --> 13:14.293
-Up two?
-Yeah, up two.

13:14.877 --> 13:17.880
No, come down three lengths.
No, back up two.

13:19.006 --> 13:22.343
-Are you messing with me?
-What goes around comes around.

13:22.426 --> 13:23.260
Dad.

13:24.136 --> 13:26.055
-All right, I give in.
-There.

13:26.805 --> 13:27.640
Good.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.809
-There we go. I think that's it.
-Only one way to find out.

13:30.893 --> 13:32.520
There is only one way.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.523
Now we have the acid test.

13:39.151 --> 13:41.654
-Success.
-Yeah, it is success.

13:41.737 --> 13:44.240
-And you got to find out.
-Yeah, thanks.

13:44.323 --> 13:47.993
Thanks for the help. Now I know your
mother won't be blindsided by gravity.

13:49.578 --> 13:51.372
How are things going with Mom?

13:53.040 --> 13:53.958
They're going.

13:55.876 --> 13:57.002
Maintaining.

13:57.670 --> 14:04.009
-So are you guys back together?
-Right now, we're just... being.

14:06.053 --> 14:07.721
Why? Would it bother you if we were?

14:07.805 --> 14:09.223
You know, to be honest,

14:10.349 --> 14:12.101
at first, I thought it would.

14:12.893 --> 14:14.812
But when I see you together,

14:14.895 --> 14:18.857
it's like you've got some sort of spark
or something

14:18.941 --> 14:23.487
Mom too.
So... no, I don't have a problem with it.

14:24.905 --> 14:26.615
Oh, that's a good thing.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.787
-Can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

14:32.913 --> 14:36.834
-When did you want to be a father?
-When your mother said she was pregnant.

14:39.503 --> 14:41.630
-Wait, Abby wasn't...
-Planned?

14:41.714 --> 14:44.008
No. We didn't plan much of anything.

14:45.676 --> 14:47.761
Maybe that was part of our problem.

14:49.972 --> 14:54.059
Because Sarah and I, we've been trying
for a couple of months now.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.603
-Really?
-Yeah.

14:55.686 --> 14:56.687
Wow.

14:57.354 --> 15:00.733
-Give it time. It'll happen.
-Think I have what it takes?

15:00.816 --> 15:03.569
-To be a father?
-To be a good father.

15:04.111 --> 15:06.322
Oh, well, that's a tough one.

15:06.906 --> 15:12.119
"He who hath wife and children,
hath given hostages to fortune."

15:13.287 --> 15:16.707
-Sir Francis Bacon said that.
-Sir Francis needed to chill.

15:16.790 --> 15:19.501
Yeah, but once you have kids
you'll understand.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.837
Your life just isn't your own anymore.

15:21.921 --> 15:26.508
You are suddenly, shockingly,
no longer the center of the universe.

15:27.551 --> 15:32.723
You try to be as good a father as you can
be, but sometimes it's just not enough.

15:36.352 --> 15:37.436
You did okay, Dad.

15:38.187 --> 15:40.272
Yeah, here's hoping you do better.

15:40.856 --> 15:43.317
I'm sure you will. I set a very low bar.

15:45.861 --> 15:47.947
But I'd like you to do me a favor.

15:48.030 --> 15:52.743
Hang on to this moment
while it's still just the two of you...

15:54.536 --> 15:58.707
because once the kids come,
it'll never be just the two of you again.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.418
Go make memories.

16:02.211 --> 16:03.045
Thanks.

16:04.463 --> 16:05.297
Sure.

16:15.349 --> 16:16.725
I wasn't a surprise?

16:17.810 --> 16:20.646
No. You were the only one we planned.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.038
[phone ringing]

16:40.040 --> 16:40.874
Mick?

16:41.625 --> 16:42.960
[scoffs]

16:43.043 --> 16:45.212
Why are you calling me
when you're right there?

16:45.963 --> 16:48.340
Well, I wanted to ask you out to dinner.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.801
Oh. Okay.

16:50.884 --> 16:53.595
And I didn't wanna put you on the spot.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.097
Hmm.

16:55.180 --> 16:59.727
-Are you asking me out on another date?
-Yes. I'm putting you on the spot.

17:01.061 --> 17:04.106
I would be happy to go
on another date with you.

17:04.189 --> 17:07.943
-Great. I'll pick you up at 8:00.
-That would be nice.

17:08.986 --> 17:10.112
Goodbye.

17:34.762 --> 17:38.974
-Hey, can I get $40 on number four?
-Yeah. Anything else?

17:39.558 --> 17:41.769
Yeah, I'll get this water. Thanks.

17:43.687 --> 17:47.816
-Luke? Luke Tatum?
-Just insert your card here.

17:47.900 --> 17:51.612
It's Kevin O'Brien.
We played high school basketball together.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.407
Just don't pull it out until it's done.

17:56.825 --> 18:01.789
Come on, Luke. We ran track too. You beat
me in the 400-meter dash, senior year.

18:01.872 --> 18:03.290
You remember that.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.418
Yeah, I remember.

18:07.586 --> 18:10.255
It wouldn't be much of a race now.
I'm slower.

18:12.007 --> 18:13.217
How have you been?

18:13.300 --> 18:14.176
I...

18:15.761 --> 18:18.514
-'Cause after high school, you...
-Disappeared?

18:19.264 --> 18:22.017
Yeah, kind of. I guess we lost touch.

18:22.684 --> 18:25.896
-Yeah, it happens.
-So how long have you been back?

18:27.356 --> 18:29.191
Just take your card, O'Brien.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.945
Thanks for shopping at Kwik Go.

18:40.828 --> 18:44.039
Oh, it's hard to believe
there's only one week of school left.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.542
-Oh, the years are going by so fast.
-Yes.

18:47.209 --> 18:50.420
I'm thinking of writing
a stern letter to the Department of Time.

18:50.504 --> 18:51.839
-Are you?
-Yeah.

18:52.339 --> 18:56.135
-I have the address, if you're interested.
-Well, I'll take it under advisement.

18:59.096 --> 19:02.724
So I guess
I won't be seeing you every day.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.227
Unless...

19:05.894 --> 19:07.062
Unless?

19:08.355 --> 19:09.898
Unless I do see you.

19:11.191 --> 19:15.237
We could, you know, see each other.

19:16.738 --> 19:17.865
Jay, I just...

19:18.615 --> 19:23.162
Hey, I know you're going through a lot
of stuff, and I totally respect that.

19:23.787 --> 19:26.957
-I haven't asked about it.
-Which I really appreciate.

19:27.583 --> 19:31.712
But I just want you to know that I'm here
for you whenever you come out...

19:33.422 --> 19:34.756
of whatever you're in.

19:39.428 --> 19:40.929
You're a sweet guy, Jay.

19:41.638 --> 19:42.472
Ouch.

19:43.056 --> 19:47.060
In my experience, that statement
is usually followed by a "but."

19:47.144 --> 19:50.606
"You're a sweet guy, Jay,
but can't we just be friends?"

19:50.689 --> 19:51.523
Like that.

19:53.400 --> 19:56.612
No "but," just "sweet."

19:58.155 --> 19:58.989
I'll take it.

20:04.536 --> 20:07.497
Well, I must say, David,
that was a marvelous meal.

20:07.581 --> 20:09.249
I really liked the mushroom risotto.

20:09.333 --> 20:12.377
-It's one of David's specialties.
-Oh, it's nothing.

20:13.003 --> 20:17.049
You see? It's nothing.
He went to culinary school for nothing.

20:19.259 --> 20:21.803
I'm joking, of course. It was very nice.

20:22.721 --> 20:23.972
It's a good joke.

20:24.848 --> 20:28.769
Um... We have something
that we wanna talk to you about.

20:28.852 --> 20:32.105
-Yes?
-It's about the wedding.

20:32.689 --> 20:36.026
I know you're all set
on having the ceremony in England--

20:36.109 --> 20:37.319
Wales, actually.

20:38.403 --> 20:40.322
But we want to... um...

20:40.405 --> 20:43.367
-[Dennis] Yes?
-We want to be married here.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.662
In Jess' hometown.

20:48.372 --> 20:49.581
You do?

20:49.665 --> 20:52.501
Yes. And, also,
we don't want a big wedding.

20:52.584 --> 20:56.338
We want a small, intimate ceremony
with family and friends.

21:01.051 --> 21:02.094
All right.

21:02.844 --> 21:03.887
All right?

21:04.972 --> 21:05.847
All right.

21:06.598 --> 21:07.849
They said all right.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.352
It's your wedding.

21:10.852 --> 21:13.814
If you want to get married here,
well, that's fine.

21:14.398 --> 21:17.150
Your mother and I give you our blessing.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.070
Okay, well...

21:23.323 --> 21:24.241
Well, cheers.

21:24.324 --> 21:25.325
Cheers to that.

21:27.661 --> 21:28.495
Great.

21:37.504 --> 21:38.839
This is very nice.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.300
Yeah. Comfortable.

21:42.634 --> 21:43.468
Comfortable?

21:44.553 --> 21:47.597
Come on, Mick, really?
That's as good as you got?

21:47.681 --> 21:50.934
Oh, you know what I mean.
We know each other. It's nice.

21:51.018 --> 21:52.311
Hmm.

21:53.478 --> 21:55.731
So you think you know all about me?

21:55.814 --> 21:58.191
Don't I? I know your favorite film,

21:58.275 --> 22:00.944
your favorite ice cream,
your favorite Beatle.

22:01.028 --> 22:03.071
Hmm, maybe I've changed.

22:03.155 --> 22:05.407
Casablanca, peppermint, and George.

22:06.116 --> 22:07.159
You remember.

22:07.743 --> 22:10.662
Well, that goes two ways,
Mr. O'Brien. Let's see.

22:11.538 --> 22:16.501
The Dirty Dozen, rocky road, and Paul.

22:17.294 --> 22:18.795
Touché. Well done.

22:24.092 --> 22:26.178
-What is it, Mick?
-Dilpher.

22:29.890 --> 22:31.099
-Do you wanna leave?
-No.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.310
We got here first.
We're having a good time.

22:33.393 --> 22:36.730
-Oh, there are a lot of places we can eat.
-It's fine.

22:38.273 --> 22:41.359
-I'm sorry, I didn't mean to snap at you.
-It's okay.

22:45.989 --> 22:50.827
Hey, Mick, Megan. I was wondering
if I'd run into you somewhere.

22:50.911 --> 22:53.330
-Well, you have.
-What are you doing here?

22:54.748 --> 22:58.335
-Just trying to get away from my troubles.
-And they have a way of showing up.

22:58.418 --> 23:02.714
Yeah, that's for sure.
Look, Mick, we should talk.

23:03.465 --> 23:06.718
-Talk?
-Yeah, they're building a case against us.

23:06.802 --> 23:08.011
There is no us.

23:08.095 --> 23:10.388
What are you talking about?
We're in this together.

23:10.472 --> 23:14.017
-We're not in anything together.
-So you just throw me under the bus now?

23:14.101 --> 23:20.524
What you did, you did entirely
on your own. Don't drag me down with you.

23:20.607 --> 23:25.403
It's not what the records show. That's not
how I'll testify if it comes to that.

23:29.616 --> 23:32.369
-You ought to leave.
-I ain't going anywhere.

23:33.495 --> 23:34.538
Mick.

23:41.211 --> 23:42.587
All right, let's go.

23:48.593 --> 23:50.220
You'll be hearing from my attorney.

23:55.559 --> 23:58.562
-You're a good man, Mick.
-But a lousy date.

23:58.645 --> 24:01.106
Hmm. Started out well.

24:04.109 --> 24:05.861
You're worried about Dilpher?

24:07.696 --> 24:11.241
Come on, honey. Everyone knows
what an honest man you are.

24:12.450 --> 24:13.285
I hope so.

24:14.494 --> 24:15.328
Hey.

24:16.496 --> 24:17.497
I know so.

24:30.510 --> 24:33.054
[rock music playing over speakers]

24:33.138 --> 24:36.474
Ah, to Bree O'Brien,
internationally acclaimed playwright.

24:36.558 --> 24:39.936
And to Connor O'Brien,
the distinguished attorney.

24:40.020 --> 24:43.982
And to Kevin O'Brien,
a brave first responder.

24:44.065 --> 24:47.110
Oh, you guys aren't
starting the toasts without me.

24:47.194 --> 24:51.031
And to Abby O'Brien, who is
somehow surviving working with Dad.

24:51.114 --> 24:51.948
Yes.

24:52.032 --> 24:55.243
-Cheers to that.
-The O'Briens are on top of the world.

25:00.624 --> 25:02.792
You sure you're okay
being here at The Bridge?

25:02.876 --> 25:04.628
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

25:04.711 --> 25:06.630
You're gonna have to talk to me
eventually.

25:06.713 --> 25:07.881
Eventually.

25:07.964 --> 25:08.798
-Bree.
-Yeah?

25:08.882 --> 25:13.178
You may have forgotten after two months
in England, but this is called cold beer.

25:13.845 --> 25:17.849
-It's cold.
-Okay, they have cold beer in England.

25:18.975 --> 25:21.686
They have cool beer, on cold days.

25:22.687 --> 25:25.106
I need one. I'm gonna get another round.

25:28.235 --> 25:30.779
So, what's it like to work
at that big-honking law firm?

25:30.862 --> 25:35.784
Mm, well, they got me working
on a big-honking case. It's intimidating.

25:35.867 --> 25:39.579
-So amped up last night, I couldn't sleep.
-I know how you feel.

25:39.663 --> 25:44.793
So the first time that I was deployed
in Kandahar, I was really nervous.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.587
You always have to top me, don't you?

25:47.671 --> 25:50.298
-I just can't help myself.
-No, you can't.

25:50.382 --> 25:52.342
I'll go see if Abby needs a hand.

25:56.596 --> 25:58.974
-Need a hand?
-Yes. Thank you.

25:59.557 --> 26:00.600
So how are you doing?

26:01.184 --> 26:03.436
I'm great, why does everyone
keep asking me that?

26:03.520 --> 26:06.147
-Because we love you.
-Thank you.

26:07.941 --> 26:09.442
-Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

26:19.869 --> 26:23.123
[Trace] No. Right now, I'm not happy.
I'm not happy at all.

26:23.999 --> 26:27.669
So, what are we doing? Why are we trying
to force this to be something?

26:27.752 --> 26:28.837
You can't be serious.

26:29.921 --> 26:32.424
After high school, you ran off to New York

26:32.507 --> 26:34.843
because I was going nowhere,
and you wanted more.

26:34.926 --> 26:36.553
-Trace.
-Now that you wanna stay,

26:36.636 --> 26:40.140
-suddenly, I'm to blame for everything?
-I'm not blaming you. I'm blaming us.

26:40.223 --> 26:42.809
And you loved having me
around on the edges,

26:42.892 --> 26:44.853
just waiting for me
to get my act together.

26:44.936 --> 26:47.856
Listen to us. Does this sound
like a healthy relationship?

26:53.570 --> 26:55.989
All right! Beers.

26:56.072 --> 26:58.366
-Thank you.
-[Abby] Welcome.

26:59.784 --> 27:01.453
-Cheers, guys!
-[all] Cheers!

27:34.861 --> 27:38.573
-Here are those case files you wanted.
-Thanks, Ms. Keller, you're a lifesaver.

27:38.656 --> 27:41.159
I am, and it's Margaret.

27:41.242 --> 27:43.536
Oh, thanks. I didn't wanna presume.

27:43.620 --> 27:45.914
-Very respectful.
-And you can call me Connor.

27:45.997 --> 27:47.707
I'm reporting you to HR.

27:48.833 --> 27:51.920
-Wait, what?
-I'm kidding. I'm kidding!

27:53.463 --> 27:57.092
-How about I call you O'Brien for now?
-That is fine, Keller.

27:57.759 --> 27:58.885
See you around.

27:59.969 --> 28:00.804
Hey.

28:01.846 --> 28:04.808
What are your thoughts
on this wage-discrimination case?

28:05.392 --> 28:09.145
Well, I'm a woman,
and I'm African American.

28:09.229 --> 28:11.398
So how much time do you have?

28:12.524 --> 28:14.859
Have a seat. I'd love your perspective.

28:24.119 --> 28:25.203
[Jess] There he is.

28:26.704 --> 28:27.539
Hey, Dad!

28:28.415 --> 28:30.083
Oh, hey, honey!

28:30.166 --> 28:31.709
Hi, Dennis, Deirdre.

28:31.793 --> 28:34.295
-Mick. How have you been?
-Good.

28:34.879 --> 28:36.506
My, what a lovely ship.

28:36.589 --> 28:39.050
Actually, it's a boat.

28:39.634 --> 28:40.760
Is there a difference?

28:40.844 --> 28:44.681
My father used to say a boat was a hole
in the water you throw money in.

28:45.306 --> 28:47.684
I've heard that before. It's very funny.

28:49.018 --> 28:52.355
-Care to come aboard?
-Oh, go ahead, Dennis.

28:52.856 --> 28:55.442
-Jess and I wanna talk.
-You don't have to.

28:55.525 --> 28:59.112
Well, have a drink and get to know
your new co-father-in-law.

28:59.696 --> 29:02.949
-What will you be to each other anyway?
-Family?

29:04.200 --> 29:06.119
Look, we don't have to take the boat out.

29:06.202 --> 29:08.413
We could toast the happy couple
at the dock.

29:09.247 --> 29:12.459
-Well, I won't say no to that.
-Well, welcome aboard.

29:13.460 --> 29:14.961
-Come on in.
-Thank you.

29:15.044 --> 29:16.087
-Bye!
-Bye.

29:17.630 --> 29:20.425
Here we go. Let me show you around.

29:25.305 --> 29:27.807
Hey, thanks for signing up to help out.

29:27.891 --> 29:31.227
Yeah. I mean, many hands make light work.

29:31.311 --> 29:34.939
Tell me about it. Final parent-teacher day
can be a real bear.

29:35.023 --> 29:37.942
Yeah. Which is worse,
the parents or the teachers?

29:38.026 --> 29:39.152
Depends on the day.

29:40.403 --> 29:43.615
Hey, by the way, have you
seen Carrie's artwork lately?

29:43.698 --> 29:47.118
A little bit. She's been keeping it
mostly to herself. Hey.

29:47.202 --> 29:48.244
Hey.

29:48.328 --> 29:50.079
It's really good.

29:50.747 --> 29:55.627
This past year, her talent has blossomed.
Her art teacher's blown away.

29:56.127 --> 29:57.462
-That's amazing.
-Yeah.

29:59.255 --> 30:02.884
-Carrie, is that yours?
-Yeah.

30:02.967 --> 30:06.179
Honey, that is wonderful.
Why didn't you share it with me?

30:06.262 --> 30:09.933
You'd say it's wonderful
because you're my mom and you have to.

30:10.016 --> 30:13.645
No, I'd say it's wonderful
because look at it, it's wonderful.

30:13.728 --> 30:16.856
-See? There she goes.
-Well, what do you think of it?

30:18.983 --> 30:21.986
It's okay, I guess.
But look at that shading.

30:22.946 --> 30:25.573
I didn't want this picture,
but I had to put up something.

30:25.657 --> 30:30.787
Well, of course you should always try
to do better, and I know you will.

30:31.579 --> 30:34.541
But you need to own
how good this really is.

30:35.291 --> 30:37.585
It's okay to be proud
of something you've done.

30:38.336 --> 30:41.464
Okay, it's good.
But the next one is gonna be awesome.

30:46.094 --> 30:47.178
You did well.

30:47.262 --> 30:50.265
Yeah, it was okay.
I'll do better with the next kid.

30:59.816 --> 31:00.984
To David and Jess!

31:01.860 --> 31:05.238
To David and Jess!
May their love be happy and enduring.

31:07.907 --> 31:08.867
Mm!

31:09.576 --> 31:10.743
That's smooth.

31:10.827 --> 31:11.786
It is that.

31:15.456 --> 31:16.666
David's a good man.

31:17.292 --> 31:19.419
Yes, he'll find his way.

31:19.502 --> 31:21.254
Oh, I think he already has.

31:21.838 --> 31:22.755
Well, for now.

31:24.132 --> 31:29.429
You know, you've made yourself
quite an empire here, Mick, haven't you?

31:29.512 --> 31:32.181
And you know what that means
to pass it on to a son.

31:32.265 --> 31:35.018
-Or a daughter.
-Or a daughter.

31:36.686 --> 31:41.107
I think the important thing is that they
find a passion and they follow it.

31:41.190 --> 31:44.611
Exactly. But it has to be
the right passion.

31:46.613 --> 31:47.780
Okay?

31:48.531 --> 31:50.241
Let's talk about the wedding.

31:51.409 --> 31:55.872
Well, Jess has always had
this dream wedding.

31:56.456 --> 31:59.459
And she used to act it out,
on the point facing the house,

31:59.542 --> 32:02.879
in a long flowing white dress
with flowers in her hair.

32:03.546 --> 32:06.049
A lone fiddler playing "Ashokan Farewell,"

32:06.132 --> 32:09.594
and her brothers and sisters
reading poetry, really lovely, actually.

32:11.262 --> 32:12.472
Yeah, that's nice.

32:14.682 --> 32:17.560
But we Pecks have a dream wedding too.

32:17.644 --> 32:19.979
Actually, it's sort of tradition.

32:20.980 --> 32:23.650
We always have a destination wedding

32:23.733 --> 32:26.903
at our ancestral home
in Denbighshire, Wales.

32:26.986 --> 32:29.614
Pecks fly in from all over the world.

32:30.198 --> 32:35.036
-Sounds like a logistical nightmare.
-Not easy to pull off, but it's worth it.

32:35.119 --> 32:38.498
Right now, David is thinking
of foregoing that tradition.

32:38.581 --> 32:39.791
Oh?

32:39.874 --> 32:43.878
-He doesn't wanna get married in Wales?
-Oh, he does, ultimately.

32:44.462 --> 32:49.300
But right now, he's thinking that sweet
little wedding of Jess' is more...

32:50.718 --> 32:52.095
Exactly what he'd like?

32:53.805 --> 32:58.309
Mick, I'm wondering if you wouldn't
mind talking to your daughter.

32:58.393 --> 33:03.940
Explain to her that it's more than Wales,
castle, grandeur. It's really--

33:04.023 --> 33:05.692
Exactly what you'd like.

33:06.484 --> 33:11.155
Well, yes. I mean, it's family custom.
Can't break a hundred years of tradition.

33:11.906 --> 33:14.617
-Hundred years, huh?
-Yeah, give or take a few.

33:16.494 --> 33:18.204
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

33:19.038 --> 33:20.164
That's wonderful.

33:20.248 --> 33:23.167
You know, I always knew
we would see eye to eye.

33:23.251 --> 33:25.294
And we don't expect you
to pay for it either.

33:25.378 --> 33:26.421
You don't?

33:27.005 --> 33:30.591
No, sir. It's on us.
It's our thing, after all.

33:30.675 --> 33:33.636
Well, Jess is in the wedding too,
or have you forgotten that?

33:34.595 --> 33:36.014
No, of course not.

33:36.097 --> 33:39.434
And, traditionally, the father
of the bride pays for the wedding,

33:39.517 --> 33:41.310
whether it's in Wales or in Maryland.

33:41.394 --> 33:45.440
Understood. I was just offering to help.

33:45.523 --> 33:46.482
Ah.

33:47.817 --> 33:49.318
Well, here's to helping.

33:54.657 --> 33:58.411
I envy you. You're entering
a whole new chapter of your life.

33:59.454 --> 34:02.081
-Thank you, Mrs. Peck.
-Oh, call me Deirdre.

34:03.249 --> 34:05.126
Better yet, call me Mom.

34:06.169 --> 34:08.421
Okay. Deirdre.

34:10.173 --> 34:11.007
Mom.

34:13.634 --> 34:17.180
Marriage is a big enough step for anyone,
but you're not just marrying a man.

34:17.263 --> 34:20.683
-You're marrying a Peck.
-I'm marrying David.

34:20.767 --> 34:22.310
I used to think that too.

34:23.186 --> 34:27.148
But when you become part of a family
like the Pecks, it's a big responsibility.

34:27.815 --> 34:29.150
A lot comes with that.

34:29.233 --> 34:31.569
-David explained that.
-I'm sure he has.

34:31.652 --> 34:34.363
But you wanna make sure
that you're protected.

34:34.447 --> 34:36.991
-Protected?
-Well, not taken advantage of.

34:37.075 --> 34:39.577
Oh, not by David. I don't mean that.
He's a sweet boy.

34:39.660 --> 34:43.831
But the rest of the family is rather--

34:43.915 --> 34:44.749
Rather what?

34:45.291 --> 34:46.417
Shortsighted.

34:47.251 --> 34:48.252
Selfish, even.

34:48.878 --> 34:52.173
So you want to make sure
that your rights are clearly spelled out.

34:52.256 --> 34:54.133
-In writing.
-A contract?

34:54.217 --> 34:56.844
Oh, nothing like that. An agreement.

34:57.720 --> 34:59.847
-A prenup?
-If you will.

35:01.724 --> 35:05.019
I've had something drawn up.
I'll leave it in your room?

35:05.978 --> 35:08.815
-Okay.
-You don't even have to look at it.

35:08.898 --> 35:10.775
Just know that it's there.

35:12.860 --> 35:15.530
I don't want anything
to spoil your happiness.

35:17.031 --> 35:18.282
Thank you, Mrs. Peck.

35:19.283 --> 35:20.118
Deirdre.

35:20.993 --> 35:21.828
Mom.

35:23.496 --> 35:25.206
I do like the sound of that.

35:58.072 --> 36:00.741
So it looks like
this boutique hotel is a go.

36:01.242 --> 36:02.201
Yes.

36:02.285 --> 36:07.081
But Mr. Bigshot has decided to put in
a microbrewery, for the hipsters.

36:08.166 --> 36:11.502
Well, it's good. I mean, this is a huge
project here in Chesapeake Shores.

36:11.586 --> 36:12.920
Lots of local jobs.

36:13.921 --> 36:15.089
Yeah, I guess.

36:16.465 --> 36:20.970
-Okay, why don't you sound more enthused?
-It's that developer, Evan Kincaid.

36:21.053 --> 36:24.473
-He rubs me the wrong way.
-Why? I've seen him interviewed.

36:24.557 --> 36:26.767
-He's witty and dynamic.
-He thinks he's dynamic.

36:26.851 --> 36:30.188
That whole I'm-successful-
but-still-down-to-Earth thing,

36:30.271 --> 36:31.772
it's genuinely annoying.

36:32.273 --> 36:34.650
And he's always calling me
from his Gulfstream.

36:34.734 --> 36:37.695
He is so stubborn. He thinks
his ideas are the only good ones.

36:38.321 --> 36:42.491
Interesting. Has a plane, stubborn,
doesn't sound like anyone I know.

36:42.575 --> 36:46.120
-What might you be implying, daughter?
-Oh, nothing, Father.

36:47.038 --> 36:50.458
Will you remind me to prepare
for this meeting with Taylor Martin?

36:50.541 --> 36:51.375
Will do.

36:53.169 --> 36:55.963
-You sure you're not working too hard?
-No.

36:56.589 --> 36:57.840
To distract yourself?

36:58.633 --> 36:59.717
From what?

37:00.593 --> 37:01.636
You tell me.

37:02.887 --> 37:07.016
Dad, I'm fine.
I mean, I appreciate it, but I'm fine.

37:11.562 --> 37:14.482
Microbrewery. Microbrain.

37:15.900 --> 37:19.528
One of our associates has some thoughts
on this case I found very interesting.

37:20.279 --> 37:21.906
-O'Brien?
-Thank you, Linda.

37:21.989 --> 37:24.951
Well, I was looking
through the 1963 Equal Pay Act,

37:25.034 --> 37:27.245
and I think I found something
that we can use.

37:28.329 --> 37:32.625
-If you'll just turn to...
-Ms. Nelson, your 3:00 is here.

37:32.708 --> 37:33.709
Thank you.

37:34.585 --> 37:35.711
-Continue, Connor.
-Sure.

37:35.795 --> 37:37.964
If you turn to page 879.

37:39.715 --> 37:41.759
-It's subsection B...
-Mr. Dilpher.

37:41.842 --> 37:42.677
Hey.

37:42.760 --> 37:45.471
I'm glad you're letting us represent you
in your current troubles.

37:45.554 --> 37:49.016
Well, to be honest, I need somebody
who can work a miracle.

37:49.809 --> 37:53.688
I can't promise that. But I'm working
on something we can use.

37:53.771 --> 37:54.605
What's that?

37:57.275 --> 37:59.944
We might have an inside track
on Mick O'Brien.

38:10.204 --> 38:12.915
So good to have a good hamburger
on the grill. Thanks, Dad!

38:12.999 --> 38:16.502
Can't get that in England,
or any good food for that matter.

38:18.087 --> 38:19.171
That's not true.

38:19.255 --> 38:20.339
So true.

38:20.923 --> 38:21.757
Thanks, honey.

38:22.425 --> 38:26.846
Oh, by the way, David's father asked me
to talk to you about something.

38:27.722 --> 38:28.723
-He did?
-Yeah.

38:28.806 --> 38:31.559
He wants you and David
to get married in Wales.

38:33.019 --> 38:34.937
Well, we wanna get married here.

38:35.021 --> 38:36.522
Okay, I'll tell him that.

38:37.523 --> 38:39.942
-That's it?
-He told me to ask, I asked.

38:40.026 --> 38:41.152
It's your wedding.

38:42.737 --> 38:44.488
Thanks, Dad. Love you.

38:44.572 --> 38:45.406
Love you more.

38:48.909 --> 38:52.288
Okay, so you know that I talked
to my high school nemesis.

38:52.371 --> 38:53.998
-Jerome Trask?
-Mm-hmm.

38:54.081 --> 38:56.459
-You know about Jerome Trask?
-Yeah.

38:56.542 --> 38:59.920
-You told Abby about Jerome Trask?
-Well, ish.

39:00.004 --> 39:02.923
-She'd read my diary.
-I had to look out for you.

39:03.007 --> 39:05.926
Wait, so are you gonna meet with him
about the playwright thing?

39:06.010 --> 39:08.721
No. That's right, no.

39:08.804 --> 39:13.809
Unless... that's what he wants.

39:14.727 --> 39:17.480
To prove that I'm still afraid of him.
Well, you know what?

39:17.563 --> 39:20.232
If that's what he thinks,
he's got another thing coming.

39:20.316 --> 39:22.026
I will show him. I'll meet with him.

39:22.109 --> 39:26.155
I'll be the best playwright-in-residence
that U of M has ever seen.

39:26.238 --> 39:30.159
You know, I like when I see that I'm not
the most neurotic person in the family.

39:30.242 --> 39:32.161
Oh, not by a long shot.

39:32.244 --> 39:34.497
Hey, Bree. What a thoughtful gift.

39:34.580 --> 39:38.000
-I am gonna stand out in the courtroom.
-You look so good.

39:38.084 --> 39:40.211
I do declare, I do look good!

39:41.545 --> 39:45.800
Wow, you really nailed the gifts.
I love my sapphire jubilee plate.

39:45.883 --> 39:48.344
It's gonna look so good
on the mantel at the B and B.

39:48.427 --> 39:49.470
I thought so.

39:50.930 --> 39:57.019
-And you? Do you like yours?
-This antique calendar is very creative.

39:57.103 --> 39:59.355
That is what The London Times called me.

40:00.523 --> 40:01.524
[bell rings]

40:01.607 --> 40:04.568
Okay, you guys. Come on.
Time to play Balderdash.

40:04.652 --> 40:07.029
Oh, why do we do this? Bree always wins.

40:07.905 --> 40:09.865
I'll sit this one out, give you a chance.

40:09.949 --> 40:13.327
[Connor] Oh, yes. Guilty!
Not guilty! One of the two.

40:15.413 --> 40:18.082
Okay. Just you and me.

40:18.165 --> 40:19.291
Mm-hmm.

40:19.375 --> 40:22.002
-Spill.
-What?

40:22.586 --> 40:24.588
Abby, am I gonna have
to force it out of you?

40:24.672 --> 40:27.508
I've been to the Tower of London.
I know how.

40:30.970 --> 40:33.431
You wanna hear about me and Trace?

40:34.140 --> 40:35.057
I do.

40:37.435 --> 40:39.019
Ugh. Fine.

40:40.020 --> 40:42.481
I mean, let's be honest.

40:44.692 --> 40:47.695
We want different things out of life.
You know that.

40:48.904 --> 40:51.615
There are two things
that I really care about in this world.

40:52.199 --> 40:54.118
My music and you.

40:54.201 --> 40:55.536
You say that,

40:56.454 --> 41:01.125
but as soon as you have me, or as soon
as you have some success with your music,

41:01.625 --> 41:03.878
you figure out a way to throw it away.

41:04.962 --> 41:07.423
You need to figure out
what you want out of life.

41:07.506 --> 41:11.260
-I want you! Can't you hear me?
-Oh, my-- Can't you hear me?

41:11.343 --> 41:14.013
I want you to go chase your dream
and stop chasing me!

41:14.638 --> 41:15.890
You love the chase.

41:17.641 --> 41:19.768
Maybe we both love the chase.

41:21.770 --> 41:24.773
I think we need to stop
trying to recreate something...

41:25.858 --> 41:28.777
that wasn't supposed to last
in the first place.

41:29.987 --> 41:31.655
You don't believe that.

41:34.325 --> 41:36.577
What we had, it was beautiful...

41:38.287 --> 41:39.955
but it's not going anywhere.

41:42.583 --> 41:46.295
I think it's over and we both know it.

41:46.378 --> 41:48.172
How can you be so sure?

41:51.258 --> 41:52.092
I don't know.

41:54.720 --> 41:58.140
But maybe we're both more in love
with our memories

41:58.224 --> 42:00.434
than with the person
standing in front of us.

42:04.021 --> 42:05.022
[sniffles]

42:05.856 --> 42:07.441
That's when he left?

42:08.025 --> 42:09.318
Few days later.

42:11.570 --> 42:12.738
I'm sorry.

42:21.997 --> 42:23.999
[instrumental music playing]

44:05.100 --> 44:07.394
-[narrator] Next on Chesapeake Shores:
-[Bree] What is that?

44:07.478 --> 44:09.438
-A prenup.
-[Bree] Did you tell David?

44:09.521 --> 44:12.024
I left something in your room. A surprise.

44:12.107 --> 44:13.442
Well, it's obviously a bribe.

44:13.525 --> 44:15.694
The legendary Bree O'Brien.

44:15.778 --> 44:16.862
Hello, Jerome.

44:16.945 --> 44:18.197
You want me to ask you out.

44:18.280 --> 44:20.324
[Abby]
Jay, I don't think it's a good idea.

44:20.407 --> 44:22.326
-[Trace] I'm leaving.
-[Abby] Please don't do this

44:22.409 --> 44:24.745
-on account of me.
-I was staying here on account of you.

44:24.828 --> 44:27.081
-This is our business.
-We can't take the chance.

44:27.164 --> 44:29.792
[Mick] That is the third job
we've lost in a month.
