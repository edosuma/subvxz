00:01.034 --> 00:02.167
<i>Previously on "Alias. "</i>

00:02.168 --> 00:04.668
Hands behind your head.

00:06.673 --> 00:09.403
Lauren, please, don't do this.

00:16.049 --> 00:18.549
God, what are you doing?

00:18.852 --> 00:20.986
Give me the gun, Lauren.

00:25.258 --> 00:28.022
Sark said you might back out.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.399
Did the forensics check out?

00:33.400 --> 00:34.566
Yes.

00:34.567 --> 00:37.502
The official cause
of death was suicide.

00:37.570 --> 00:39.638
Do you accept that?

00:39.639 --> 00:41.740
At this point I have
no reason not to.

00:41.741 --> 00:43.809
In going through
the senator's effects,

00:43.810 --> 00:46.078
we discovered evidence
that for the past year,

00:46.079 --> 00:49.480
he has been consulting with you
regarding Rambaldi's work.

00:49.549 --> 00:52.049
As a result,
we have been given authority

00:52.118 --> 00:55.246
to officially revoke
your pardon agreement.

00:55.321 --> 00:59.018
In two weeks, you'll be executed
by lethal injection.

00:59.859 --> 01:02.657
The box you lost
has not been opened

01:02.729 --> 01:04.495
since the time of Rambaldi.

01:04.497 --> 01:07.193
It was rumored
to contain the strain

01:07.267 --> 01:10.668
of a plague-like bioweapon
capable of killing millions.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.671
This bioweapon.

01:12.672 --> 01:14.273
What do you know about it?

01:14.274 --> 01:18.267
Only that The Covenant
refers to it as The Passenger.

01:25.752 --> 01:28.744
I placed something powerful
in that box.

01:30.223 --> 01:34.660
And now The Covenant has it,
and that terrifies me.

01:35.862 --> 01:38.263
I secured that box
so it could be opened

01:38.264 --> 01:41.233
by keys that Rambaldi himself
had hidden.

01:43.203 --> 01:45.763
Bomani and Sark found the keys.

01:52.245 --> 01:54.745
Which means they have the heart.

01:57.884 --> 01:59.918
The Di Regno heart
is an engine designed

01:59.919 --> 02:03.616
to power Rambaldi's
ultimate creation.

02:04.357 --> 02:05.991
Il Dire.

02:05.992 --> 02:09.018
Which means "The Telling. "

02:11.531 --> 02:15.399
What they will witness is
nothing short of a resurrection.

02:21.774 --> 02:24.042
As if Rambaldi is reaching
through the centuries

02:24.043 --> 02:26.543
to deliver a message.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:38.458 --> 02:40.958
He's speaking.

02:49.135 --> 02:51.303
The Covenant is after
The Passenger.

02:51.304 --> 02:54.205
How will II Dire
help them obtain it?

02:55.041 --> 02:58.101
If I help, will you
stay my execution?

02:58.711 --> 03:00.646
No.

03:00.647 --> 03:03.147
I will not.

03:08.288 --> 03:09.955
We're done here.

03:09.956 --> 03:13.221
I'll talk to Jack Bristow
about The Passenger.

03:16.663 --> 03:20.827
There will be no deal.

03:23.770 --> 03:26.270
You make that quite clear.

03:45.191 --> 03:48.922
There's been some cyber attack.
Dixon's ready to brief us.

03:48.995 --> 03:51.196
You know, Syd,
no one would blame you

03:51.197 --> 03:53.697
if you hated him
for going back to her.

03:54.267 --> 03:56.568
He's not the one I hate.

03:56.569 --> 03:57.936
How horrible does that sound?

03:57.937 --> 04:00.437
I'm mad at her, and I don't
even think he's cute.

04:00.506 --> 04:03.304
But it's not just about
them being together.

04:03.376 --> 04:07.107
My dad thinks Lauren's leaking
information to The Covenant.

04:07.180 --> 04:09.808
Didn't Senator Reed
confess to being the leak?

04:09.882 --> 04:12.050
Yes, and his confessions
answered the questions

04:12.051 --> 04:15.543
my father had raised,
but I can't help it.

04:15.622 --> 04:16.822
I still have doubts.

04:16.822 --> 04:18.589
Let me just ask you a question.

04:18.591 --> 04:22.527
Do you think she's the mole, or
do you want her to be the mole?

04:27.567 --> 04:28.734
12 hours ago,

04:28.735 --> 04:32.466
a large-scale cyber-terrorist
attack was launched.

04:33.206 --> 04:36.972
This computer virus originated
from a server in Berlin,

04:37.043 --> 04:40.012
infecting servers
throughout Europe and Asia.

04:40.079 --> 04:42.447
It's estimated
that within 24 hours,

04:42.448 --> 04:44.973
it will consume over half
of all Internet bandwidth.

04:45.051 --> 04:47.551
This particular worm targets
medical facilities,

04:47.587 --> 04:50.087
universities,
laboratories, hospitals.

04:50.089 --> 04:52.785
To date, 20 terabytes
of patient medical records

04:52.859 --> 04:54.926
and databases
have been corrupted.

04:54.927 --> 04:56.995
We believe The Covenant
is behind this?

04:56.996 --> 04:59.131
We know The Passenger
is a bioweapon.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.500
Given the targets,
we're assuming The Covenant

05:01.501 --> 05:02.968
is launching a precursor attack.

05:02.969 --> 05:05.494
Maybe they're trying to shut
down the treatment facilities.

05:05.571 --> 05:08.006
Weaken medical response
capabilities.

05:08.007 --> 05:09.975
Are these our only leads?

05:09.976 --> 05:11.410
Actually, no.

05:11.411 --> 05:14.710
This code has all the trademarks
of a hacker known as Cypher.

05:14.781 --> 05:17.149
Guess what.
He operates out of Berlin.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.914
Vaughn, Sydney,
go to Berlin and identify him.

05:19.986 --> 05:23.820
Confirm he created the worm, and
find out how we shut it down.

05:23.890 --> 05:26.757
See Marshall for your op-tech.
You leave in two hours.

05:31.798 --> 05:34.199
Okay, hackers
are a paranoid bunch.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.268
The one we want
is known as Cypher.

05:36.269 --> 05:38.999
He's kind of a celebrity
in the on-line community.

05:39.072 --> 05:41.572
But in the real world,
it's like he doesn't exist.

05:41.641 --> 05:46.305
Don't worry, 'cause, lucky
for you, I kind of have a name

05:46.379 --> 05:49.041
in the hacker community myself.

05:49.115 --> 05:51.615
Black Kitty.

05:53.286 --> 05:56.221
Anyway, I was able to penetrate
Cypher's network

05:56.289 --> 05:58.323
and track him down
to an IRC chat.

05:58.324 --> 06:00.659
Tomorrow night,
he'll be at a club in Berlin.

06:00.660 --> 06:02.561
How do we identify him?

06:02.562 --> 06:05.087
Well, that's where these
come in.

06:05.164 --> 06:08.497
Now, not only are they
a freshy-fresh pair of glasses.

06:08.568 --> 06:10.635
Hello.

06:10.636 --> 06:13.136
They're also a wireless sniffer.

06:13.139 --> 06:15.835
Cypher uses a digital system
with a unique code.

06:15.908 --> 06:18.243
I've programmed the sniffer
to seek it out.

06:18.244 --> 06:21.509
Now, all you have to do is
press this button right here,

06:21.581 --> 06:24.607
and it will hack into his
computer and send him a message.

06:24.684 --> 06:25.917
Pretty cool.

06:25.918 --> 06:28.053
Are we sure he'll have
his computer?

06:28.054 --> 06:31.387
Does a cowboy leave his gun at
home when he goes to the saloon?

06:33.359 --> 06:34.593
All right, trust me.

06:34.594 --> 06:37.094
He'll have it.

06:43.603 --> 06:46.299
How long before we match
the sequence from II Dire?

06:46.372 --> 06:49.398
The worm has reached
Latin America.

06:49.475 --> 06:52.467
By this time tomorrow,
the database will be complete,

06:52.545 --> 06:55.045
and we should have
a perfect match.

06:57.950 --> 07:00.510
I received a call
from my associate.

07:00.586 --> 07:04.249
By associate, I assume
you mean Miss Reed.

07:05.024 --> 07:07.392
Yes.

07:07.393 --> 07:10.692
It seems the CIA is more
industrious than we'd assumed.

07:10.763 --> 07:13.891
They've discovered the identity
of our hacker friend.

07:14.567 --> 07:17.067
She's taking care of him.

07:19.939 --> 07:20.939
This girl.

07:20.940 --> 07:25.138
Her work for us of late
has been uneven.

07:26.179 --> 07:28.046
Il Dire is in our possession

07:28.047 --> 07:30.982
because she managed
to steal it from the CIA.

07:31.050 --> 07:33.644
She is a considerable asset.

07:33.719 --> 07:37.246
An asset for you in ways
that do not interest me.

07:37.757 --> 07:41.193
I will stake my reputation
on her abilities.

07:41.260 --> 07:43.922
And I will hold you
to your word.

07:43.996 --> 07:45.964
But understand...

07:45.965 --> 07:50.868
if you are mistaken, you both
will endure the consequences.

07:59.579 --> 08:00.979
I could go with you.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.314
You're going to Berlin.

08:02.315 --> 08:05.284
They can send someone else.
You shouldn't do this alone.

08:06.185 --> 08:08.587
I won't be alone.
Mom will be there.

08:08.588 --> 08:10.088
My father's will made it clear

08:10.089 --> 08:12.990
he wants his ashes
scattered in Dover.

08:13.726 --> 08:15.093
The last thing I need

08:15.094 --> 08:17.961
is another person close to me
letting the CIA down.

08:18.030 --> 08:19.331
No one's judging you.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.299
You see the way they look at me.

08:21.300 --> 08:23.800
Like I'm a traitor, too.

08:24.871 --> 08:27.371
To tell you the truth,
I don't blame them.

08:28.875 --> 08:30.342
People are just angry.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.409
And I'm not?

08:32.410 --> 08:34.910
He was my father.

08:35.780 --> 08:38.750
You have no idea what it's like
to know someone, love them,

08:38.818 --> 08:41.650
and then figure out
it was nothing but lies.

08:44.490 --> 08:46.990
I'm sorry.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.472
Getting anything?

09:34.473 --> 09:36.973
Not yet.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.585
That's him.

10:13.879 --> 10:15.480
Nice trick.

10:15.481 --> 10:18.075
I'll have to readjust
my firewall settings.

10:18.150 --> 10:20.650
I could still get through.

10:20.953 --> 10:22.621
I don't believe we've met.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.122
We're big fans of your work.

10:25.491 --> 10:27.092
Perhaps you've heard
of our work.

10:27.093 --> 10:29.361
The DDOS attack on the Syrian
government's network.

10:29.362 --> 10:31.730
Shut them down for a week.

10:31.731 --> 10:34.231
That was you?

10:35.835 --> 10:38.998
Nothing compared to what
you've got going on.

10:45.244 --> 10:46.645
Clever coding.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.615
That worm's going to be
circulating for months.

10:52.551 --> 10:55.315
I think you have me
confused with someone else.

10:57.023 --> 10:58.890
I didn't design that worm.

10:58.891 --> 11:01.951
And even if I did,
you could never prove it.

11:03.295 --> 11:04.996
So if you'll excuse me.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.497
Sit down.
We're CIA.

11:12.171 --> 11:14.172
I know you people
get your power trips

11:14.173 --> 11:17.267
by designing viruses,
breaking into systems.

11:17.343 --> 11:18.877
But you have designed a worm

11:18.878 --> 11:21.346
that is helping
a terrorist organization

11:21.347 --> 11:23.975
launch a biological weapon.

11:25.851 --> 11:28.019
Once your employers complete
what they've set out to do,

11:28.020 --> 11:30.682
you will be guilty of murdering
thousands of people.

11:30.756 --> 11:31.856
He didn't tell me.

11:31.857 --> 11:32.791
Who's he?

11:32.792 --> 11:35.590
He didn't give a name.
He was young, British.

11:35.661 --> 11:38.323
Why is the worm attacking
medical facilities?

11:38.831 --> 11:40.265
That was not its function.

11:40.266 --> 11:42.333
They asked me to engineer
a worm that was capable of...

11:48.007 --> 11:50.507
I'm going after the shooter.

12:21.340 --> 12:23.840
Sorry.

13:13.125 --> 13:14.425
We have a problem.

13:14.426 --> 13:17.725
He had the files with him.
He gave them to the CIA.

13:17.797 --> 13:21.028
If they have the source code,
they can stop the worm.

13:21.100 --> 13:22.600
We will lose everything.

13:22.601 --> 13:25.570
There's time, if I corrupt the
files before they make a copy.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.272
That's an extreme risk.

13:27.273 --> 13:29.773
Letting Bomani know
I failed isn't?

13:29.775 --> 13:32.275
You'll hear from me soon.

13:36.315 --> 13:37.916
Jack.

13:37.917 --> 13:41.785
Dixon has given me clearance
to talk about one thing only.

13:41.854 --> 13:43.421
The Passenger.

13:43.422 --> 13:46.414
I've told you everything
I know about The Passenger.

13:46.492 --> 13:49.950
I used that as a pretext so
Dixon would allow time with you.

13:50.029 --> 13:51.930
This is not a time for games.

13:51.931 --> 13:53.231
This is no game, Jack.

13:53.232 --> 13:55.732
This is my life.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.169
The CIA wants me executed
next week

13:58.170 --> 14:00.670
because they believe
I was working with Senator Reed.

14:00.706 --> 14:02.006
I was.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.775
My association with Senator Reed

14:03.776 --> 14:06.904
had nothing to do with advancing
The Covenant's agenda.

14:07.479 --> 14:09.681
Two years ago,
Senator Reed recruited me

14:09.682 --> 14:12.708
to work for an organization
inside the U.S. Government.

14:13.352 --> 14:16.788
They refer to themselves
as The Trust.

14:16.856 --> 14:20.257
He indicated he was interested
in my knowledge of Rambaldi.

14:20.326 --> 14:21.693
He made me an offer.

14:21.694 --> 14:25.323
If I was to agree to work with
him, he would secure my pardon.

14:25.397 --> 14:27.599
And from that time on,

14:27.600 --> 14:30.160
I did nothing but live up
to my part of the bargain.

14:30.236 --> 14:31.736
I've never heard of The Trust.

14:31.737 --> 14:34.237
The senator was my only contact.

14:34.673 --> 14:36.908
Why haven't
they come to your aid?

14:36.909 --> 14:39.409
I don't know.

14:40.312 --> 14:42.974
Maybe they were fearful
of revealing themselves.

14:43.048 --> 14:46.017
Or it could be that
I outlived my usefulness.

14:46.085 --> 14:48.585
But you ask yourself, Jack.

14:49.288 --> 14:51.788
Have I been helpful this year?

14:52.224 --> 14:54.724
Tell me, have I
lived up to my word?

14:55.895 --> 14:58.762
I helped Sydney recover
her memory.

14:59.531 --> 15:02.796
I took a bullet for you,
for God's sake.

15:03.535 --> 15:06.333
Well, now I need something
in return.

15:06.839 --> 15:10.969
I need you to prove
that this group exists.

15:11.977 --> 15:14.502
I was serving my country, Jack.

15:15.381 --> 15:17.881
Not betraying it.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.628
I'm connecting
the flash drive Cypher gave us.

15:30.629 --> 15:33.189
Let's hope all his files
are here.

15:33.265 --> 15:35.400
Cypher's dead.

15:35.401 --> 15:36.801
It was the hospital.

15:36.802 --> 15:39.302
He didn't make it
through surgery.

15:42.574 --> 15:45.236
Vaughn, I think I saw Lauren.

15:45.644 --> 15:46.311
What?

15:46.312 --> 15:48.613
In the club after the shooting.

15:48.614 --> 15:50.782
The Covenant knew
we were after Cypher.

15:50.783 --> 15:53.283
What are you saying?
Lauren is Covenant?

15:53.319 --> 15:54.552
I can't be sure.

15:54.553 --> 15:57.053
The shooter was wearing a wig.
It was dark.

15:57.056 --> 16:00.355
Lauren's father was the one
passing intel to The Covenant.

16:00.426 --> 16:01.492
He killed himself.

16:01.493 --> 16:03.494
Don't you think
it's convenient he died

16:03.495 --> 16:05.530
taking the blame
for the leaks with him?

16:05.531 --> 16:07.565
Are you suggesting
Lauren framed her father?

16:07.566 --> 16:09.500
I know it's hard
for you to consider.

16:09.501 --> 16:12.868
For me? My wife just found out
her father was betraying her.

16:12.938 --> 16:15.600
- But if I saw her.
- You didn't.

16:19.111 --> 16:22.911
Lauren and her mother are
in England burying her father.

16:26.418 --> 16:29.046
I know things haven't worked out
the way we'd hoped.

16:29.121 --> 16:30.655
You think that's
why I'm bringing this up?

16:30.656 --> 16:33.156
Honestly, I don't know
what to think.

16:43.268 --> 16:45.768
Michael!

16:46.305 --> 16:48.339
Dixon told me
I might find you here.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.840
I had to see you.

16:53.912 --> 16:57.905
I thought I hated him,
but when Mom and I got there.

16:57.983 --> 17:00.184
Those cliffs.

17:00.185 --> 17:03.621
I don't know how many times
Dad and I took walks there.

17:05.523 --> 17:07.325
In the States
he was never around,

17:07.326 --> 17:09.826
but in England it was different.

17:12.998 --> 17:15.762
Being there,
remembering him that way,

17:15.834 --> 17:17.201
he didn't feel like a traitor.

17:17.202 --> 17:19.702
He was just my father.

17:24.276 --> 17:26.800
While we were there,
Mom gave me this.

17:27.378 --> 17:29.879
Dad had given it to her
when I was born.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.882
She thought I might like
to have it.

17:38.757 --> 17:41.257
It's gonna be okay.

17:43.629 --> 17:44.629
Hello?

17:44.630 --> 17:47.065
Hello, Mrs. Reed.
I'm sorry to disturb you.

17:47.066 --> 17:50.058
This is Kathleen
from Director Pembroke's office.

17:50.135 --> 17:53.935
I have the director holding on
a secure line for Lauren Reed.

17:54.006 --> 17:56.770
I was told she could be
reached at this number.

17:56.842 --> 17:58.309
No, Miss Reed's not here.

17:58.310 --> 18:00.445
She's in Berlin.

18:00.446 --> 18:04.314
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
she was leaving London so soon.

18:04.783 --> 18:09.083
If you don't mind my asking,
when did she leave for Berlin?

18:09.154 --> 18:11.456
She left here
just a few hours ago.

18:11.457 --> 18:13.591
Would you like me
to give her a message?

18:13.592 --> 18:14.792
No message.

18:14.793 --> 18:17.293
Thank you.

18:39.084 --> 18:41.584
It's been a long time, Jack.

18:42.054 --> 18:44.648
I need information
regarding a covert committee

18:44.723 --> 18:46.157
within the U.S. Government.

18:46.158 --> 18:48.459
It's called The Trust.

18:48.460 --> 18:51.691
If there were a group, where
would appropriations come from?

18:51.763 --> 18:54.698
Intelligence budgets
are classified.

18:54.766 --> 18:57.496
What makes you assume
it's Intelligence?

18:58.670 --> 19:01.434
I need evidence
this group exists.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.309
These people are powerful, Jack.

19:06.378 --> 19:08.938
Inquiring about them
will put me at risk.

19:09.014 --> 19:10.414
Why should I do that?

19:10.415 --> 19:13.509
Because then I will be
in your debt.

19:14.419 --> 19:18.185
I'm sure you remember
how useful that can be.

19:28.367 --> 19:30.501
Marshall's standing by.

19:30.502 --> 19:33.630
As soon as we copy the memory,
we'll uplink it to him.

19:33.705 --> 19:36.205
How far along are we?

19:36.775 --> 19:39.275
Almost a quarter of the way.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.692
Here you go.

19:59.064 --> 20:01.499
Michael says you've been
awake all night.

20:01.500 --> 20:04.000
I'm good, thanks.

20:04.002 --> 20:06.502
Maybe later then.

20:06.838 --> 20:08.806
I've got some pretty bad news.

20:08.807 --> 20:11.537
The memory on Cypher's
flash drive was wiped.

20:11.610 --> 20:15.603
I think it was exposed
to a strong magnetic field.

20:15.681 --> 20:16.847
How is that possible?

20:16.848 --> 20:19.442
Seeing that we haven't had
any solar flare activity

20:19.518 --> 20:20.952
within the past 24 hours,

20:20.953 --> 20:23.453
I'd have to say
it was done intentionally.

20:23.455 --> 20:26.424
Could Cypher have corrupted the
data before he handed it to us?

20:26.491 --> 20:28.492
It's possible
he had a fail-safe,

20:28.493 --> 20:30.194
but I haven't found
any evidence.

20:30.195 --> 20:31.562
We've lost everything?

20:31.563 --> 20:33.531
Not everything, thanks to me.

20:33.532 --> 20:34.865
And electron microscopy.

20:34.866 --> 20:37.068
I've been able to partially
reconstruct his files,

20:37.069 --> 20:39.270
including the worm's
source code.

20:39.271 --> 20:40.271
You guys ready?

20:40.272 --> 20:42.968
That thing isn't purposely
destroying data.

20:43.041 --> 20:44.342
That's a side effect.

20:44.343 --> 20:46.177
It's collecting information.

20:46.178 --> 20:48.806
It's what's called
an intelligence-gathering worm.

20:48.880 --> 20:51.713
The Covenant
are looking for something.

20:52.050 --> 20:52.683
What?

20:52.684 --> 20:54.485
I haven't figured that out,

20:54.486 --> 20:56.053
but I've tweaked
the worm's source code

20:56.054 --> 20:57.555
so it won't destroy more data.

20:57.556 --> 21:01.287
All the data it is collecting
is being rerouted to our server.

21:01.360 --> 21:05.353
Whatever The Covenant's looking
for, we're going to get it now.

21:08.233 --> 21:10.534
CIA cut the feed?

21:10.535 --> 21:13.035
I'm trying to get it back.

21:13.939 --> 21:16.908
Tell me why I shouldn't
snap your neck right now.

21:16.975 --> 21:19.110
In case it escaped your memory,

21:19.111 --> 21:22.808
I secured your release
from that Siberian prison.

21:24.650 --> 21:27.551
This work is as important to me
as it is to you.

21:27.619 --> 21:30.247
No one will jeopardize that.

21:30.756 --> 21:33.316
I clearly overestimated
Miss Reed's abilities.

21:33.392 --> 21:35.226
A little too late for that.

21:35.227 --> 21:36.127
Yes.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.429
But she's still on the inside.

21:38.430 --> 21:40.798
I will make sure she re-acquires
the information

21:40.799 --> 21:43.200
the CIA stole from us.

21:43.201 --> 21:46.830
Once she passes it along,
she will be eliminated.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.366
See we get that information
as soon as possible then.

21:55.847 --> 21:57.315
This cannot be a coincidence.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.876
Do you believe Lauren
would corrupt the files

21:59.951 --> 22:01.619
with you and Vaughn watching?

22:01.620 --> 22:03.954
If she were
desperate enough, yes.

22:03.955 --> 22:06.290
Dad, if Lauren really is
The Covenant mole,

22:06.291 --> 22:09.488
if she did assassinate Cypher,
she could never have anticipated

22:09.561 --> 22:12.621
he'd have the code on him,
let alone give it to us.

22:12.998 --> 22:14.365
And what about Vaughn?

22:14.366 --> 22:17.597
I've tried talking to him. He
won't entertain the possibility.

22:17.669 --> 22:20.169
It's like he can't hear it.

22:20.272 --> 22:22.772
Perhaps he can't hear it
from you.

22:41.893 --> 22:44.393
Sydney spoke to you.

22:45.564 --> 22:48.064
All I ask
is that you hear me out.

22:49.134 --> 22:53.468
My marriage with Irina,
in spite of everything,

22:53.538 --> 22:56.371
was a happy time for me.

22:56.708 --> 22:58.509
It was easy being with her.

22:58.510 --> 23:04.813
But there were times, moments,
when I became curious.

23:04.883 --> 23:07.383
How had she occupied
her morning?

23:07.386 --> 23:10.048
What were her plans
while I was out of town?

23:12.391 --> 23:16.384
Usually she told me,
but occasionally she'd stop

23:16.461 --> 23:21.091
what she was doing,
walk over, and offer me a kiss.

23:21.166 --> 23:23.794
A spontaneous gesture.

23:25.103 --> 23:27.970
But on one occasion
it struck me.

23:28.673 --> 23:31.173
This impulsive kiss.

23:32.611 --> 23:35.111
What if it was an evasion?

23:35.714 --> 23:39.309
Camouflaging the truth
in an expression of love?

23:40.919 --> 23:43.053
I dismissed
my concern immediately.

23:43.054 --> 23:46.490
Merely my professional paranoia.

23:47.959 --> 23:50.689
After all, she was my wife.

23:51.563 --> 23:54.063
I don't regret
having married her.

23:54.900 --> 23:57.134
I have Sydney because
of our time together.

23:57.135 --> 24:02.334
What I do regret is once
I saw signs of her duplicity,

24:02.407 --> 24:07.538
once I sensed her betrayal,
I chose to ignore it.

24:09.214 --> 24:12.206
All I'm asking is that you
be responsive to the signs

24:12.284 --> 24:15.378
if and when
they present themselves.

24:21.827 --> 24:24.327
You never respected me.

24:24.796 --> 24:27.321
Never thought I was
worthy of your daughter.

24:27.399 --> 24:31.392
I'm not surprised you're quick
to think Lauren is betraying me.

24:32.103 --> 24:35.402
But whether or not
you or Sydney believe me,

24:35.474 --> 24:37.608
I know the life I'm living,

24:37.609 --> 24:40.669
and I know the woman
I am married to.

24:41.112 --> 24:46.140
Lauren is not Irina,
and I am definitely not you.

25:00.632 --> 25:03.100
This is what The Covenant
was looking for.

25:03.101 --> 25:03.767
DNA?

25:03.768 --> 25:04.835
The worm was designed

25:04.836 --> 25:06.570
to cross-reference genetic
databases,

25:06.571 --> 25:08.939
searching the entire globe
for one person.

25:08.940 --> 25:11.909
Judging by the double-X
chromosome, I'm saying female.

25:11.977 --> 25:13.177
Have they found a match?

25:13.178 --> 25:14.645
That's a good question.

25:14.646 --> 25:16.981
There are 10.

25:16.982 --> 25:19.350
10 matches to one code?
That's impossible.

25:19.351 --> 25:20.885
Unless they're
identical dectuplets,

25:20.886 --> 25:22.920
which is a statistical
impossibility.

25:22.921 --> 25:25.446
Or if the person
uses different identities.

25:25.524 --> 25:28.024
We should brief Dixon
immediately.

26:13.271 --> 26:15.706
Hey.
Have you seen Lauren?

26:15.707 --> 26:17.341
Yeah, she's in
Marshall's office.

26:17.342 --> 26:19.842
Thanks.

26:50.108 --> 26:52.376
- You scared me.
- I was looking for you.

26:52.377 --> 26:54.411
I was leaving
a present for Marshall.

26:54.412 --> 26:56.912
Well, for Mitchell.

26:57.816 --> 27:00.376
Don't worry.
Your name's on it, too.

27:01.119 --> 27:03.387
I was gonna have lunch.
Cafe Stella.

27:03.388 --> 27:05.089
I've got to run a few errands.

27:05.090 --> 27:06.857
Need some company?
I've got time.

27:06.858 --> 27:10.021
You don't have to do that.
I'll see you there in an hour.

27:10.095 --> 27:12.595
Okay. Sure.

28:15.260 --> 28:17.760
Is this line secure?

28:20.131 --> 28:21.532
There's been a change.

28:21.533 --> 28:22.633
No dead drop.

28:22.634 --> 28:24.868
You'll be meeting
with a Covenant agent.

28:24.869 --> 28:26.070
- Who?
- Me.

28:26.071 --> 28:28.571
I'm in the parking garage,
third level.

28:29.941 --> 28:32.242
My situation is precarious.

28:32.243 --> 28:34.871
This is not the time
to change protocol.

28:41.486 --> 28:42.720
Weiss.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.688
Run a tap on Lauren's cellphone.

28:44.689 --> 28:47.189
We devised a new plan
regarding The Passenger.

28:47.192 --> 28:50.218
Bomani's instructed me to meet
with you face-to-face.

28:50.595 --> 28:53.996
I'm surprised. I'd assumed that
given what happened with Cypher,

28:54.065 --> 28:56.066
Bomani would be furious with me.

28:56.067 --> 28:58.729
We rely on you.
You know that.

29:02.107 --> 29:04.541
The call's encrypted.
She must be talking to the NSC.

29:04.542 --> 29:07.067
Try running it
through the filter.

29:07.946 --> 29:11.848
Get off the escalator.
I'm in the northwest corner.

29:14.719 --> 29:17.219
You came all this way?

29:18.423 --> 29:21.415
Okay, okay, almost there.

29:21.493 --> 29:22.826
We need to talk.

29:22.827 --> 29:25.062
There are other ways
to make contact.

29:25.063 --> 29:28.692
Yes, but he insisted that
I meet with you face-to-face.

29:31.669 --> 29:34.365
What else did Bomani tell you?

29:34.439 --> 29:37.306
Did he instruct you on
the quietest way to murder me?

29:37.375 --> 29:38.475
Absolutely not.

29:38.476 --> 29:41.309
You pathetic little errand boy.

29:42.280 --> 29:45.044
Tell Bomani he'll get proof of
my worth next time he sees me.

29:45.116 --> 29:46.884
When I deliver The Passenger.

29:46.885 --> 29:47.584
I got it.

29:47.585 --> 29:49.953
After all we've been through,
how could you do this?

29:49.954 --> 29:54.254
I thought I could rely on you.
I'll never forgive you for this.

29:54.325 --> 29:56.326
Okay.
What the hell was that?

29:56.327 --> 29:58.827
I have no idea.

30:06.237 --> 30:07.104
Sorry I'm late.

30:07.105 --> 30:09.605
That's fine.
I was late myself.

30:11.910 --> 30:13.443
How were your errands?

30:13.444 --> 30:14.812
They were fine.

30:14.813 --> 30:17.247
Yeah?
What did you do?

30:17.248 --> 30:19.748
Just things.

30:19.984 --> 30:22.782
Okay, like what kind of things?

30:24.322 --> 30:27.052
Truth is, I got a call
from my mother.

30:27.125 --> 30:29.719
She kept bombarding me
with questions about my father,

30:29.794 --> 30:34.128
wanting to know why I didn't
see it, why I didn't stop him.

30:35.033 --> 30:37.467
It was like she was blaming me.

30:37.468 --> 30:42.064
I was just so upset,
so I wandered around the mall.

30:46.711 --> 30:49.211
What's the matter?

30:50.348 --> 30:53.044
I'm just sorry
you had to go through that.

30:59.224 --> 31:02.955
The 10 names on Marshall's list
were aliases for the same woman.

31:03.027 --> 31:06.258
It's possible this is
what II Dire gave Sloane.

31:06.331 --> 31:07.931
A way to identify this woman.

31:07.932 --> 31:10.492
We ran background checks
on all her identities.

31:10.568 --> 31:13.332
Records revealed she was treated
by the same physician.

31:13.404 --> 31:15.138
A Dr. Robert Viadro.

31:15.139 --> 31:17.007
His practice is based in Milan.

31:17.008 --> 31:18.809
Vaughn is on his way in now.

31:18.810 --> 31:21.310
You two leave tonight.

31:35.660 --> 31:37.394
Good afternoon.
Dr. Viadro?

31:37.395 --> 31:38.795
Yes.

31:38.796 --> 31:41.031
I need to speak with you.

31:41.032 --> 31:43.532
It concerns The Passenger.

31:46.938 --> 31:48.705
Who sent you?

31:48.706 --> 31:50.007
The Covenant?

31:50.008 --> 31:52.508
That is none of your...

32:21.139 --> 32:22.539
Good.

32:22.540 --> 32:25.040
We have some privacy.

32:39.390 --> 32:41.890
Where is The Passenger?

32:45.964 --> 32:49.365
I said, where is The Passenger?

32:50.101 --> 32:52.934
She's safe.

33:10.355 --> 33:12.855
Vaughn.

33:14.759 --> 33:17.259
Rambaldi.

33:18.629 --> 33:21.129
I'll go check upstairs.

33:23.768 --> 33:26.328
You had to make this difficult.

33:30.375 --> 33:32.875
Aah!

34:23.728 --> 34:25.762
It's terribly painful.

34:25.763 --> 34:28.263
Still, none are fatal.

34:38.708 --> 34:41.208
Damn it!

34:41.545 --> 34:44.045
Tell me what I need to know!

34:44.449 --> 34:45.849
I'll tell you.

34:45.850 --> 34:48.350
Oh!

35:31.629 --> 35:33.830
The Passenger.

35:33.831 --> 35:36.331
I have betrayed her.

35:40.104 --> 35:41.972
I have betrayed her.

35:41.973 --> 35:44.473
Betrayed who?

35:45.143 --> 35:48.010
Years spent protecting her.

35:48.579 --> 35:51.079
And now she's alone.

35:51.149 --> 35:52.482
Who's she?

35:52.483 --> 35:54.983
Who are you protecting?

35:56.420 --> 35:58.355
Those guards were
Order of Rambaldi.

35:58.356 --> 36:00.090
You're the one.

36:00.091 --> 36:02.591
The one from the prophecy.

36:03.761 --> 36:05.128
- Wait!
- Drop it!

36:05.129 --> 36:07.629
You will not hurt her.

36:33.558 --> 36:36.058
Keep this in a safe place.

36:38.362 --> 36:40.163
Here it is.

36:40.164 --> 36:42.689
Everything you need
to find The Passenger.

36:42.767 --> 36:46.430
You went to great lengths
to secure this information.

36:47.004 --> 36:48.004
Thank you.

36:48.005 --> 36:52.032
I trust this removes any doubts
concerning my usefulness.

36:52.109 --> 36:54.411
Yes, yes.

36:54.412 --> 36:55.478
You've done well.

36:55.479 --> 36:59.313
Unfortunately, The Covenant has
no more use of your services.

37:12.630 --> 37:16.896
I went to Los Angeles
to warn you, not kill you.

37:17.668 --> 37:20.762
Perhaps in the future,
you should try trusting me more.

37:26.010 --> 37:27.410
Bristow.

37:27.411 --> 37:28.845
Sloane told you the truth.

37:28.846 --> 37:30.847
The black budget front
for The Trust

37:30.848 --> 37:32.415
is Project: Centigrade.

37:32.416 --> 37:34.976
Details have been left for you
in the usual place.

37:35.052 --> 37:36.786
I am in your debt.

37:36.787 --> 37:39.813
A fact which I hope
to benefit from someday.

37:39.890 --> 37:41.791
Be careful, Jack.

37:41.792 --> 37:44.522
The Trust is not a group
to be taken lightly.

37:47.498 --> 37:49.998
I need to speak with you
in private.

37:51.969 --> 37:53.670
Do you recall that I requested

37:53.671 --> 37:56.401
Dr. Barnett's notes from
her sessions with Sloane?

37:56.474 --> 37:59.034
Yes.
Did they reveal anything?

37:59.910 --> 38:01.278
Yes.

38:01.279 --> 38:04.840
There is something in the notes
that concerns you.

38:04.915 --> 38:08.851
In one of his sessions
with Barnett,

38:08.919 --> 38:11.254
Sloane admitted having
an affair with Irina

38:11.255 --> 38:13.755
while you were married.

38:40.851 --> 38:45.481
I found no evidence of the
existence of a so-called Trust.

38:45.556 --> 38:46.856
Oh.

38:46.857 --> 38:49.690
I find that very hard
to believe, Jack.

38:49.760 --> 38:51.161
A man with your contacts.

38:51.162 --> 38:53.662
I've done everything I can.

38:54.265 --> 38:58.326
I'm afraid the secrets you keep
are hard to uncover.

38:59.170 --> 39:02.105
Some of them you'll have
to take to your grave.

39:04.141 --> 39:08.635
If I die, I won't be able
to help you find The Passenger

39:08.713 --> 39:11.273
before The Covenant does, Jack.

39:14.218 --> 39:17.415
You have no idea
how that will affect you.

39:17.488 --> 39:20.787
You and Sydney.

39:22.827 --> 39:23.960
Dad.

39:23.961 --> 39:25.428
Sydney.

39:25.429 --> 39:27.664
I heard what happened
with the doctor.

39:27.665 --> 39:30.498
We were wrong about
The Passenger. It's a person.

39:30.568 --> 39:33.162
The doctor sacrificed his life
trying to protect her.

39:33.237 --> 39:36.172
When he saw me, it was
almost like he recognized me.

39:36.240 --> 39:38.765
Like I was his worst fear
come to life.

39:38.843 --> 39:40.977
Dad, when he tried to kill me,

39:40.978 --> 39:43.012
he was trying to protect
The Passenger from me.

39:43.013 --> 39:45.573
Sloane told me that
after II Dire said "peace,"

39:45.649 --> 39:48.846
he searched for every possible
meaning in that message.

39:48.919 --> 39:50.687
He traced the etymology
of the word

39:50.688 --> 39:52.889
to its Greek form, "eirene. "

39:52.890 --> 39:56.519
Also the derivation
of the name "Irina. "

39:56.594 --> 40:00.496
Sydney, I think The Passenger
may be your mother.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.409
I'm looking forward
to a weekend alone.

40:12.410 --> 40:14.910
Me too.

40:22.553 --> 40:25.053
So, what did you do
while I was gone?

40:42.306 --> 40:44.806
I missed you.

40:44.975 --> 40:47.475
I'm going to run a bath.

40:48.305 --> 40:54.343
