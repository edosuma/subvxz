What?

00:09.000 --> 00:11.792
Hello, everyone,

00:09.000 --> 00:11.792
I'm Huxley Prescott.

00:11.834 --> 00:15.375
And this is

00:11.834 --> 00:15.375
a Space Elevator,

00:15.417 --> 00:18.542
designed to ride a cable

00:15.417 --> 00:18.542
up beyond the stratosphere.

00:18.583 --> 00:21.375
A cable that happens to be...

00:21.417 --> 00:23.709
a laser beam.

00:23.750 --> 00:26.583
Top floor, please.

00:26.625 --> 00:27.917
Let's go to

00:26.625 --> 00:27.917
our man in the field

00:27.959 --> 00:29.917
for a look

00:27.959 --> 00:29.917
at the real thing.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.333
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:34.000 --> 00:37.333

00:46.834 --> 00:50.041

00:46.834 --> 00:50.041
right on schedule.

00:50.083 --> 00:52.875
BARANOVA:

00:50.083 --> 00:52.875
Excuse me,

00:50.083 --> 00:52.875
has anyone seen our crew?

00:52.917 --> 00:57.083
Frankie? Looking forward

00:52.917 --> 00:57.083
to that yummy lunch.

00:57.125 --> 01:00.875
Daddy, I said it's

00:57.125 --> 01:00.875
launch time, not lunch time.

01:00.917 --> 01:04.333
You're late

01:00.917 --> 01:04.333
Oh! Oh, my.

01:04.375 --> 01:05.667
No sandwich then?

01:09.917 --> 01:12.333
GRAHAM:

01:09.917 --> 01:12.333
My legs don't want to move.

01:12.375 --> 01:14.917
But aren't you excited?

01:12.375 --> 01:14.917
Sure.

01:14.959 --> 01:17.750
In a terrified

01:14.959 --> 01:17.750

01:17.792 --> 01:19.792
Come on, it's not

01:17.792 --> 01:19.792
that big a deal.

01:19.834 --> 01:22.375
We've spent tons of time

01:19.834 --> 01:22.375
up in space.

01:22.417 --> 01:24.166
Of course,

01:22.417 --> 01:24.166
we were in stasis pods

01:24.208 --> 01:27.166
unaware of the many dangers

01:24.208 --> 01:27.166
directly outside the hull.

01:27.208 --> 01:29.709
Good news is,

01:27.208 --> 01:29.709
once you're at zero gravity,

01:29.750 --> 01:31.750
you can't plummet

01:29.750 --> 01:31.750
back down to Earth.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.208
( Graham groans )

01:33.250 --> 01:35.750
Graham, the Asgard

01:33.250 --> 01:35.750

You go up, then down.

Let's get a move on, son.

01:43.792 --> 01:46.417
Okay, I'm ready.

Boulder's right,

Civilians shouldn't be

07:23.667 --> 07:26.500
messing around up there.

But the whole idea

07:26.542 --> 07:28.208
of the Asgard

07:28.250 --> 07:31.166
is to give scientists

07:28.250 --> 07:31.166
easy access to space.

In any event, adding

07:31.208 --> 07:33.291
a Rescue Bot to the mission

07:33.333 --> 07:35.458
would not have guaranteed

07:33.333 --> 07:35.458
the crew's protection.

08:06.750 --> 08:10.041
anywhere near the Asgard.

08:10.083 --> 08:12.875
It's headed for something. Zoom

08:10.083 --> 08:12.875
in on that, Frankie.

08:16.667 --> 08:19.542
That appears to be

08:16.667 --> 08:19.542
a cluster of asteroids.

08:19.583 --> 08:20.959
Is that bad?

08:21.000 --> 08:24.750
Um, not necessarily.

08:32.083 --> 08:34.083
(  dramatic theme playing  )

08:39.709 --> 08:40.917
DOC GREENE:

08:39.709 --> 08:40.917
Let's see.

08:40.959 --> 08:42.959
The Greenhouse Pod

08:40.959 --> 08:42.959
checks out.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.125
Laboratory Pod,

08:45.166 --> 08:46.500
Storage...

08:46.542 --> 08:48.667
and living quarters.

08:48.709 --> 08:51.250
Everything is stable.

08:48.709 --> 08:51.250
And that means...

08:51.291 --> 08:52.542
We did it!

08:52.583 --> 08:55.709
Oh! Phase One

08:52.583 --> 08:55.709
is thankfully over.

08:55.750 --> 08:57.333
( stomach gurgles )

08:57.375 --> 09:01.041
Before we begin Phase Two,

08:57.375 --> 09:01.041
let's go raid the kitchen.

09:01.083 --> 09:03.041
Somehow I missed lunch.

09:03.083 --> 09:04.542
Oh, what do you know?

09:04.583 --> 09:07.041
I'm kind of getting

09:04.583 --> 09:07.041
an appetite myself.

09:07.083 --> 09:08.750
( alarm beeping )

09:08.792 --> 09:10.625
Oh, I--I know this one.

09:10.667 --> 09:13.875
A little ice

09:10.667 --> 09:13.875
forming on the hull, right?

09:13.917 --> 09:16.083
No.

09:13.917 --> 09:16.083
Imminent impact alarm!

09:44.500 --> 09:46.041
Dad!

09:47.583 --> 09:49.417
They've lost

09:47.583 --> 09:49.417
the starboard pod,

09:49.458 --> 09:52.375
but the Asgard's interior

09:49.458 --> 09:52.375
pressure remains stable.

09:52.417 --> 09:54.333
We're retracting

09:52.417 --> 09:54.333
the laser cable now.

09:54.375 --> 09:56.291
Have you reached them?

09:54.375 --> 09:56.291
No.

09:56.333 --> 09:57.917
Their Com signals are down.

09:57.959 --> 10:01.166
Professor, how long will it take

09:57.959 --> 10:01.166
before they land?

10:01.208 --> 10:03.125
At least 30 minutes.

10:03.166 --> 10:04.792
(  alarm buzzing  )

10:04.834 --> 10:06.917
Now what?

10:09.458 --> 10:13.000
Debris from the severed pod

10:09.458 --> 10:13.000
is coming down over the island.

10:13.041 --> 10:15.959
Cody, you and Frankie

10:13.041 --> 10:15.959
get to the Command Center.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.834
Direct us to where

10:16.000 --> 10:17.834
that debris is falling.

10:17.875 --> 10:19.875
Okay, Dad.

10:17.875 --> 10:19.875
We're on it!

10:24.291 --> 10:26.291

10:31.709 --> 10:33.875
points of impact.

10:33.917 --> 10:36.417
( Frankie gasps )

10:36.458 --> 10:38.667
Looks like five of the pieces

10:36.458 --> 10:38.667
are going to hit the island.

10:38.709 --> 10:40.792
But with only four

10:38.709 --> 10:40.792
Rescue Bots.

10:40.834 --> 10:43.834
Dad, Chase, get to

10:40.834 --> 10:43.834
Chaucer Street and Willow.

10:43.875 --> 10:45.208
CHIEF:

10:43.875 --> 10:45.208

KADE: Got it.

10:47.041 --> 10:49.333
CODY: Boulder, the Zoo!

10:49.375 --> 10:51.959
BOULDER: Sure thing, Cody.

10:49.375 --> 10:51.959
CODY: Dani, Blades,

10:52.000 --> 10:53.917
two chunks of debris

10:52.000 --> 10:53.917
are headed for the drive-in.

10:53.959 --> 10:57.500
BLADES: Two? How are we--

10:53.959 --> 10:57.500
DANI: We'll handle it.

10:57.542 --> 10:59.542
( siren blaring )

11:04.083 --> 11:06.333
Power up, and energize!

11:08.583 --> 11:10.625

11:23.166 --> 11:25.792
if you could.

11:27.542 --> 11:29.709

11:34.125 --> 11:37.041
Whoa, what are you doing? Are

11:34.125 --> 11:37.041
you trying to catch that thing?

11:37.083 --> 11:39.750
Nah, but you might

11:37.083 --> 11:39.750
wanna hang on.

11:39.792 --> 11:41.500
( Heatwave grunts )

11:44.458 --> 11:47.375
You are safe now.

11:51.250 --> 11:53.083
Okay, next time,

11:53.125 --> 11:55.375
we get a foam cannon.

11:59.291 --> 12:02.417
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

12:02.458 --> 12:04.709
Are you sure

12:02.458 --> 12:04.709
this is going to work?

12:04.750 --> 12:08.375
Of course not.

12:04.750 --> 12:08.375
3, 2, 1, go!

12:08.417 --> 12:11.291
BLADES: Oh!

12:08.417 --> 12:11.291
DANI: Spin! Hard!

12:13.875 --> 12:16.083
I didn't know

12:13.875 --> 12:16.083
this movie was in 3-D.

12:16.125 --> 12:18.208
It's fantastic!

12:22.750 --> 12:27.583
If I had a highlight reel,

12:22.750 --> 12:27.583
that would definitely be on it.

12:27.625 --> 12:29.750
With a slo-mo replay.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.792
(  triumphant theme playing  )

12:33.375 --> 12:35.291
They did it!

12:33.375 --> 12:35.291
Whoo! Yes!

12:35.333 --> 12:37.709
We're all clear.

12:35.333 --> 12:37.709
Good job.

12:37.750 --> 12:40.458
Thanks, everyone.

12:37.750 --> 12:40.458
Now let's get to the launch pad

12:40.500 --> 12:44.333
and welcome home

12:40.500 --> 12:44.333
our weary travelers.

12:44.375 --> 12:47.417
MAN:

12:44.375 --> 12:47.417
The laser will retract

12:44.375 --> 12:47.417
in ten seconds.

12:47.458 --> 12:49.917
Nine. Eight.

12:49.959 --> 12:52.083
Seven. Six.

12:52.125 --> 12:54.875
Five. Four.

12:54.917 --> 12:57.166
Three. Two.

12:57.208 --> 12:59.542
One.

12:59.583 --> 13:01.333
Where are they?

13:01.375 --> 13:03.000
The asteroids must have

13:01.375 --> 13:03.000
knocked the Asgard

13:03.041 --> 13:04.417
off the laser cable.

13:04.458 --> 13:07.208
But that means...

13:04.458 --> 13:07.208
Daddy?

13:11.208 --> 13:14.875
This is Mission Control

13:11.208 --> 13:14.875
to the Asgard, do you read?

13:14.917 --> 13:17.542
I repeat, Mission Control

13:14.917 --> 13:17.542
to the Asgard.

13:17.583 --> 13:19.542
But you're the Space Agency!

13:19.583 --> 13:22.500
Are you telling me

13:19.583 --> 13:22.500
you don't have a ship available?

13:22.542 --> 13:25.333
Five days?

Can the Space Agency--

13:31.208 --> 13:32.375
Somebody has to have a ship.

13:31.208 --> 13:32.375
What'd they say?

13:32.417 --> 13:34.375
I'll even

13:32.417 --> 13:34.375
fly their ship myself.

13:34.417 --> 13:36.875
Looks like we're on our own.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.250
Rescue Bots?

13:39.959 --> 13:41.500
Understood.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.750
( hissing )

13:46.792 --> 13:48.417
We're still leaking oxygen.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.917
There.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.917
I've shut it down,

13:57.959 --> 14:00.583
but the Oxygen Generator

13:57.959 --> 14:00.583
is damaged.

14:00.625 --> 14:02.583
How much air

14:00.625 --> 14:02.583
do we have left?

14:02.625 --> 14:04.959
About 30 minutes.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.250
Should we take turns breathing?

14:13.208 --> 14:15.208

FRANKIE:

14:18.500 --> 14:21.417

14:18.500 --> 14:21.417
this was here.

14:41.166 --> 14:42.875
Boulder, Chase,

14:41.166 --> 14:42.875
you're copilots.

14:42.917 --> 14:45.583
Blades, navigation.

14:42.917 --> 14:45.583
We launch in five.

14:51.834 --> 14:54.375
Perhaps we can build

14:51.834 --> 14:54.375
an air scrubber

14:54.417 --> 14:58.000
to absorb carbon dioxide,

14:54.417 --> 14:58.000
and replenish the O2.

14:58.041 --> 15:01.166
No, there's--

14:58.041 --> 15:01.166
there's just no time, Doc.

15:01.208 --> 15:03.208
Then we need to buy time

15:03.250 --> 15:06.000
until rescue efforts

15:03.250 --> 15:06.000
can reach us.

15:06.041 --> 15:09.166
You're right.

15:06.041 --> 15:09.166
I'm thinking like a victim.

15:09.208 --> 15:11.834
I'm a rescuer.

15:11.875 --> 15:13.417
You want an air scrubber, doc?

15:13.458 --> 15:16.041
We have over 800 of them

15:13.458 --> 15:16.041
in the Greenhouse Pod.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.875
The plants!

15:16.083 --> 15:17.875
Of course!

15:17.917 --> 15:19.500
The photosynthetic process

15:19.542 --> 15:22.542
provides the Greenhouse

15:19.542 --> 15:22.542
with plenty of oxygen.

Why are you here

16:38.041 --> 16:39.625
and not down there?

19:17.166 --> 19:21.250
Now what?

19:17.166 --> 19:21.250
We did not train for this.

19:21.291 --> 19:25.083
At least I didn't.

19:21.291 --> 19:25.083
I may have missed that day.

19:25.125 --> 19:28.709
We're adrift.

19:25.125 --> 19:28.709
I don't have any propulsion.

19:28.750 --> 19:32.834
Wait a minute.

19:28.750 --> 19:32.834
Sure you do.

19:32.875 --> 19:35.667
Look, here they come!

19:35.709 --> 19:37.709
(  dramatic theme playing  )

20:18.041 --> 20:19.041
Daddy!

20:20.583 --> 20:23.333
Hello, my little homing beacon.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.667
Welcome back, son.

20:27.709 --> 20:31.417
Thanks, Dad.

20:27.709 --> 20:31.417
You had us worried.

20:31.458 --> 20:33.375
Not gonna make this

20:31.458 --> 20:33.375
a habit or nothing,

20:33.417 --> 20:35.166
but...give me a hug.

20:35.208 --> 20:37.166
It's okay,

20:35.208 --> 20:37.166
you don't have to-- Urk!

20:37.208 --> 20:39.000
Okay.

20:39.041 --> 20:41.709
And as for you,

20:39.041 --> 20:41.709
my accidental astronaut...

20:41.750 --> 20:44.709
Sorry, Dad.

20:41.750 --> 20:44.709
Heatwave kept me safe.

20:44.750 --> 20:48.208
( whoops and cheers )

20:48.250 --> 20:49.959
( all clapping )

20:52.959 --> 20:55.250
Oh, what about

20:52.959 --> 20:55.250
Professor Baranova?

20:55.291 --> 20:57.291
How will we explain...

20:57.333 --> 20:59.583
all this?

20:59.625 --> 21:01.542
Just tell her you came home

20:59.625 --> 21:01.542
the old-fashioned way.

21:01.583 --> 21:03.709
Splash down.

21:05.291 --> 21:08.750
That's our story,

21:05.291 --> 21:08.750
and we're sticking to it.

21:08.792 --> 21:12.917
Kinda nice flying

21:08.792 --> 21:12.917
the old bird again, wasn't it?

21:12.959 --> 21:14.500
Perhaps we'll get

21:12.959 --> 21:14.500
the opportunity

21:14.542 --> 21:16.333
to use her again

21:14.542 --> 21:16.333
someday.

21:16.375 --> 21:19.083
Maybe, but nothing beats

21:16.375 --> 21:19.083
rolling to the rescue

21:19.125 --> 21:21.542
on good old terra firma.

21:21.583 --> 21:23.250
Earth?

21:24.375 --> 21:26.667
Home.

21:32.709 --> 21:35.041
