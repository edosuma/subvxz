WEBVTT

00:09.130 --> 00:11.630
Ünderland.

00:12.533 --> 00:14.901
We were robbed.
No two ways about it.

00:14.902 --> 00:17.204
l don't know, pop,
they won fair and square.

00:17.205 --> 00:20.440
The lmpossible family
made a really convincing Fantastic Four.

00:20.441 --> 00:23.076
Don't make excuses for your brother.
He blew it for all of us.

00:23.077 --> 00:26.646
Henry Allen Venture, are you hearing this?
What do you have to say for yourself?

00:26.647 --> 00:30.016
- l am The Bat.
- Yes, yes. You are The Bat.

00:30.017 --> 00:35.021
And The Bat is the reason we didn't take
best group costume, mister. Again!

00:35.022 --> 00:38.525
Last year, it was Dorothy,
the Scarecrow, the Cowardly Lion...

00:38.526 --> 00:39.626
and...The Bat.

00:39.627 --> 00:42.963
And how about the time
we were the hard rocking quartet...

00:42.964 --> 00:46.299
of Gene Simmons,
Paul Stanley, Ace Frehley...

00:46.300 --> 00:47.801
and The Bat!

00:47.802 --> 00:50.503
- The night is mine.
- Sell it somewhere else, Hank.

00:50.504 --> 00:53.874
lt's not me you should be apologizing to.
Poor Brock spent a month...

00:53.875 --> 00:56.109
sewing his group
team-appropriate costume.

00:56.110 --> 00:58.445
That's probably why
he won best costume?

00:58.446 --> 01:02.382
What is that, sass l hear?
''Look everybody, Hank's back.''

01:02.383 --> 01:05.185
The re-circulated air
on my chest is a bat...

01:05.186 --> 01:07.921
- What's the matter?
- My tongue got caught in the mouth slit.

01:07.922 --> 01:10.724
- Don't stick it in the slit then.
- l can't help it.

01:10.725 --> 01:13.225
lt's maddening.

01:17.064 --> 01:19.684
He's here, your graciousness.

01:20.768 --> 01:21.835
Who?

01:21.836 --> 01:23.670
Dr. Venture, your...

01:23.671 --> 01:27.173
Say it again
and it will be your last...

01:27.174 --> 01:29.509
time saying his name.

01:29.510 --> 01:33.810
Quick! To the science box!

01:34.916 --> 01:38.184
- What are you doing?
- We'll pass over Ünderland, l'll go around.

01:38.185 --> 01:40.854
What am l, made of experimental
super sonic jet fuel?

01:40.855 --> 01:43.890
- lt's shorter this way.
- lt's smaller than Delaware, Doc.

01:43.891 --> 01:48.091
lt won't take long.
Let's just play it safe.

01:48.796 --> 01:51.786
Fire off the atomic super magnet!

01:54.001 --> 01:58.171
Full power! Prepare yourself
to throw the switch on my order.

01:58.172 --> 02:01.775
When they are within range,
we shall pluck them from the sky...

02:01.776 --> 02:06.486
like a gleaming metal peach
from a giant blue tree.

02:15.423 --> 02:17.857
My sweet little Rusty.

02:17.858 --> 02:21.094
How many years
have l longed for this moment?

02:21.095 --> 02:23.997
How many years has it been since...

02:23.998 --> 02:25.298
college!

02:25.299 --> 02:31.238
But now Baron Ünderbheit
finally exacts his sweet revenge.

02:31.272 --> 02:33.707
- Sir, we're...
- No!

02:33.708 --> 02:36.858
Say hello to goodbye,
Dr. Venture.

03:05.373 --> 03:07.173
We've lost control of our engines.

03:07.174 --> 03:08.942
l'm The Bat, l'm The Bat.

03:08.943 --> 03:12.312
What the hell was that?
What's up with my fillings?

03:12.313 --> 03:15.441
Can't...keep her...together.

03:15.483 --> 03:18.418
- Lock down auxiliary power.
- Gotta make it to the border.

03:18.419 --> 03:21.519
Chewie, lock down
auxiliary power.

03:24.992 --> 03:29.812
Everybody, get in the black box,
it's indestructible.

03:37.938 --> 03:42.637
Thank God. Out of Ünderland.
Ventures, sound off.

03:42.676 --> 03:45.712
Yeah, pretty sure my scoliosis
is going the other way now.

03:45.713 --> 03:49.382
- My butt won't stop making a fist.
- At least you have one.

03:49.383 --> 03:53.386
You're blessed with your father's ass,
Dean. Learn to love stadium cushions.

03:53.387 --> 03:59.287
- l told you to lock down on...
- We don't have auxiliary power!

04:09.336 --> 04:13.676
This might get ugly fast, Doc.
Here, take this.

04:14.842 --> 04:18.344
lt's loaded with arsenic,
gold size standard field issue.

04:18.345 --> 04:22.182
Jeez, can you be anymore dramatic?
Ünderbheit's all bluster and you know it.

04:22.183 --> 04:25.585
- Doc, the guy still blames you.
- That crap with his jaw? Never proven.

04:25.586 --> 04:27.187
Come on, it's been 20 years.

04:27.188 --> 04:32.588
- He can't still be mad about that!
- Look around, jackass!

04:35.963 --> 04:37.030
Not yet.

04:37.031 --> 04:39.365
You still have a chance.
Don't take all of it.

04:39.366 --> 04:43.937
- Or else what? l'll overdose on poison?
- l meant, share it with the boys.

04:43.938 --> 04:47.207
Cool! Secret super spiced
suicide tooth? Sign me up.

04:47.208 --> 04:50.343
You know what
would be even cooler?

04:50.344 --> 04:53.524
- Cherry ltalian ice tooth.
- Yeah.

05:00.621 --> 05:02.088
What is he doing here?

05:02.089 --> 05:06.392
Put them in the holding cells,
while l decide how they are to die.

05:06.393 --> 05:09.453
We don't have holding cells here.

05:09.497 --> 05:11.831
No holding...? Fine!

05:11.832 --> 05:14.528
Then put them in the pantry.

05:16.637 --> 05:18.104
Wait!

05:18.105 --> 05:21.165
Leave that one with me.

05:22.510 --> 05:25.010
- Hank.
- Dean.

05:32.052 --> 05:37.123
So, you thought you could keep
yourself hidden from Baron Ünderbheit?

05:37.124 --> 05:42.061
You're much healthier looking
than the others. So tender, so soft...

05:42.062 --> 05:46.966
l bet you could use some fattening up.
You'd make a most exquisite...

05:46.967 --> 05:48.768
dinner...

05:48.769 --> 05:50.737
- ...guest.
- What?

05:50.738 --> 05:54.140
l said, thank you
for being my dinner guest.

05:54.141 --> 05:56.409
- How's your timber wolf?
- What?!

05:56.410 --> 05:58.910
This is no good.
Hang on.

06:03.417 --> 06:04.584
There.

06:04.585 --> 06:07.854
- lt's much cozier this way, don't you think?
- What have you done with pop?

06:07.855 --> 06:11.457
Your father's resting comfortably
in a makeshift holding cell. Soon...

06:11.458 --> 06:14.961
- What have you done with my brother?
- He too is being held in the...

06:14.962 --> 06:17.697
What have you done
with our secret agent bodyguard?

06:17.698 --> 06:21.701
They're all in the same place, OK?
Please, they're all in your past.

06:21.702 --> 06:25.905
And tonight is about the future.
Eat something, please.

06:25.906 --> 06:28.474
The bounty of Ünderland
is yours to enjoy.

06:28.475 --> 06:31.844
Go fish!
l'm not fattening myself up for you.

06:31.845 --> 06:35.114
lf you're gonna eat me,
then you can just...

06:35.115 --> 06:37.615
deal with the gristle.

06:38.185 --> 06:42.455
ls that why you think
l brought you here? That is rich!

06:42.456 --> 06:47.560
l will have to tell manservant that one.
And he we will have to laugh.

06:47.561 --> 06:50.061
You're not gonna eat me?

06:50.531 --> 06:51.631
Of course not.

06:51.632 --> 06:57.637
l am going to make you the second
most powerful person in Ünderland.

06:57.638 --> 07:00.240
- Neat!
- So your answer's yes?

07:00.241 --> 07:02.475
Not that you have a choice.
Excellent!

07:02.476 --> 07:04.711
We will be married in the morning then.

07:04.712 --> 07:07.510
What?! l'm not marrying you!

07:07.548 --> 07:10.283
l know, you're worried
it won't work out.

07:10.284 --> 07:13.553
lt's true l've been married
several times before.

07:13.554 --> 07:15.588
Seven, in fact.

07:15.589 --> 07:19.993
They resisted at first too,
but they came around, as you will.

07:19.994 --> 07:21.594
lt's like l always say...

07:21.595 --> 07:24.697
hopelessness
is the greatest aphrodisiac...

07:24.698 --> 07:27.198
in Ünderland.

07:33.607 --> 07:35.441
My dear...

07:35.442 --> 07:38.211
l don't want you
on your back this soon.

07:38.212 --> 07:41.010
Wait until after the wedding.

07:43.951 --> 07:47.587
l'd better get this back to the cave
and run it through the computer for prints.

07:47.588 --> 07:48.888
Damn it!

07:48.889 --> 07:51.391
- What does he want Dean for?
- Mental selection.

07:51.392 --> 07:56.996
Single out the weakest of the pack,
separate him from the others.

07:56.997 --> 07:58.431
That was addressed to me.

07:58.432 --> 08:01.634
''You and your guests
are cordially invited to attend...

08:01.635 --> 08:05.505
''the unholy union of His Malevolence,
Baron Verner Ünderbheit the Fourth...

08:05.506 --> 08:08.006
''and your daughter...Dawn.

08:08.042 --> 08:09.709
''Execution to follow.''

08:09.710 --> 08:14.747
l have a sister? Named Dawn? How long
have you been keeping this from me?

08:14.748 --> 08:17.216
- Hank, no, l think...
- Don't defend him, Brock.

08:17.217 --> 08:19.552
You knew about this, didn't you?
Does Dean...?

08:19.553 --> 08:22.455
- What else haven't you told us?
- Brock, you speak crazy.

08:22.456 --> 08:25.725
- Do something about him.
- Hank, Baron Ünderbheit...

08:25.726 --> 08:27.894
Good grief, you're right, Brock!

08:27.895 --> 08:30.963
This is just what he wants
for us to turn on each other.

08:30.964 --> 08:35.144
And l played right into their hands.
Damn it!

08:37.538 --> 08:38.571
How are you?

08:38.572 --> 08:42.371
The Wallflower!
So we meet again.

08:42.409 --> 08:45.945
No, no, Wallflower
had that thing on his head.

08:45.946 --> 08:48.147
Lamest villain ever.

08:48.148 --> 08:50.683
- You're Dr. Venture.
- Who the hell wants to know?

08:50.684 --> 08:53.386
So it is true!
You are in Ünderland.

08:53.387 --> 08:56.587
This is a rescue, come.
Follow me.

09:03.130 --> 09:05.631
l'm so excited,
l can hardly sleep.

09:05.632 --> 09:07.900
She's just so...unlike the others.

09:07.901 --> 09:12.605
Such spunk, und her disdain for me
it's sweeter, somehow.

09:12.606 --> 09:15.616
l don't know, what do you think?

09:16.143 --> 09:18.211
Please, Manic 8-ball, tell me now!

09:18.212 --> 09:23.649
l've been burnt by love before.
Will this marriage be a success or not?

09:23.650 --> 09:25.017
Why do you torture me so?

09:25.018 --> 09:29.858
At least tell me
she'll last longer than the others.

09:31.558 --> 09:34.794
l knew it!
l had a feeling about her.

09:34.795 --> 09:36.529
Tell me, my fallen advisor!

09:36.530 --> 09:40.867
Just one more thing
and l promise l won't ask any more.

09:40.868 --> 09:43.368
Will l have a boy?

09:45.305 --> 09:47.540
You've made your Baron
a happy man!

09:47.541 --> 09:51.411
Und to reward you,
l grant you your release for one hour...

09:51.412 --> 09:54.742
so that you may come to the wedding.

09:58.685 --> 10:04.005
Here we are. Colonel Catclops
can hardly wait to meet you.

10:04.958 --> 10:06.659
Welcome comrades...

10:06.660 --> 10:09.160
to the Ünderground.

10:20.474 --> 10:24.610
- l usually do my own hair.
- Don't be too proud of that, honey.

10:24.611 --> 10:27.613
What are you conditioning with, kerosene?

10:27.614 --> 10:31.184
Touchy. l can't work my magic
if you don't work with me, honey.

10:31.185 --> 10:33.619
Oh, my God!
Look at this.

10:33.620 --> 10:36.889
She's got an ass like a twelve year old boy.
l'm so jealous.

10:36.890 --> 10:40.393
No wonder the master likes her.
No l didn't!

10:40.394 --> 10:42.895
You. You're cruising
for an execution, girlfriend.

10:42.896 --> 10:45.665
Honey, l have seen
seven Baronesses come and go...

10:45.666 --> 10:47.400
and they all say
the same thing.

10:47.401 --> 10:50.536
The master likes playing
the back nine at Augusta.

10:50.537 --> 10:54.040
Well, l'm done here,
gotta get cracking on the gown.

10:54.041 --> 10:58.603
Girl, you are going
to look spectacular. Ciao.

10:58.645 --> 11:00.480
Love and light, bitch.

11:00.481 --> 11:04.116
- How come you don't have an accent?
- Honey, l'm from Detroit.

11:04.117 --> 11:08.454
l guess your experimental super sonic
flying laboratory crashed too, huh?

11:08.455 --> 11:12.859
No, l wanted to go somewhere exotic
for junior year abroad.

11:12.860 --> 11:15.360
And l was mad at somebody.

11:16.630 --> 11:18.231
Sorry.
l didn't mean to...

11:18.232 --> 11:20.967
Ancient history, sweetie,
you didn't know.

11:20.968 --> 11:22.768
Now, lets get you into the tub...

11:22.769 --> 11:25.972
and see if we can't scrub
some of the the hoi polloi off you.

11:25.973 --> 11:30.076
We want you Holy Golightly
not Eliza Doolittle. l'm a eunuch, honey!

11:30.077 --> 11:33.546
You think Ünderbheit would let
another pair of balls near his wife?

11:33.547 --> 11:39.318
Trust me, even when l had them,
you've got nothing l'm interested in.

11:39.319 --> 11:41.819
Rooster in the henhouse!

11:45.292 --> 11:48.159
l'm fixed, what's your excuse?

11:48.195 --> 11:52.325
Do you have Prince Albert in the can?

11:52.366 --> 11:58.304
Well, you should get him out of the can
so that he can breath maybe.

11:58.305 --> 12:00.373
Needs work.
You've gotta sell it.

12:00.374 --> 12:03.075
This is the nerve centre
of the Ünderground, gentlemen.

12:03.076 --> 12:05.745
From here we launch
our relentless campaign...

12:05.746 --> 12:08.748
of sabotage, subterfuge
and psychological warfare.

12:08.749 --> 12:12.318
These are some of the bravest men
in Ünderland. They have to be.

12:12.319 --> 12:15.454
The penalties for treason are dire indeed.

12:15.455 --> 12:18.758
l'm proud to say
we've only lost one man to date.

12:18.759 --> 12:21.994
Helmut. Crazy SOB tried
to take on Ünderbheit by himself.

12:21.995 --> 12:25.531
He was caught trying to dip his hand
in warm water while he slept.

12:25.532 --> 12:27.733
To make him pee? Classic!

12:27.734 --> 12:30.803
Exactly. Ünderbheit saw it
coming a mile away.

12:30.804 --> 12:32.305
That was close.

12:32.306 --> 12:34.373
- Well, did it work?
- Yeah, it was perfect.

12:34.374 --> 12:36.208
- Atta girl!
- You should have seen it.

12:36.209 --> 12:38.477
We struck again tonight,
should l tell them?

12:38.478 --> 12:40.346
- Let me.
- OK.

12:40.347 --> 12:44.750
We planted a cat hair
in the Baron's water glass.

12:44.751 --> 12:46.419
ls that a scream or what?

12:46.420 --> 12:49.121
That will show the bastard.
Trying to blow us up?

12:49.122 --> 12:51.023
l don't think so!

12:51.024 --> 12:53.059
These people deserve
their crappy country.

12:53.060 --> 12:55.695
You call yourselves
a resistance movement?

12:55.696 --> 12:58.431
- We pick our battles.
- Yeah, we take it where we can get it.

12:58.432 --> 13:01.934
Now that you are here to rescue us
none of this will be necessary any more.

13:01.935 --> 13:03.536
So, what time
are we flying out?

13:03.537 --> 13:05.871
What the hell are you talking about?
Rescue you?

13:05.872 --> 13:08.507
- We were the ones in prison!
- ln pantry, technically.

13:08.508 --> 13:12.478
You haven't come to rescue us?
Then why did you bring the bat person?

13:12.479 --> 13:15.214
- And Chewbacca Wookie?
- Oh, my God!

13:15.215 --> 13:18.017
Look, we were in a costume party,
our plane crashed.

13:18.018 --> 13:22.121
lf we don't storm Ünderbheit's castle
at dawn, he's gonna marry Doc's son.

13:22.122 --> 13:24.622
Not me.

13:24.625 --> 13:28.461
So are you with us
or are you wasting our time?

13:28.462 --> 13:30.396
Slow down there, Andretti.

13:30.397 --> 13:34.734
Storm the castle? What are we, crazy?
Slow and steady wins the race.

13:34.735 --> 13:35.968
We're out of here.

13:35.969 --> 13:37.970
Just a second, Seabiscuit.

13:37.971 --> 13:40.406
You've seen our
secret headquarters.

13:40.407 --> 13:42.441
We can't just...let you leave.

13:42.442 --> 13:47.042
What are you gonna do?
Put sugar in our gas tank?

13:49.583 --> 13:52.518
Yeah, OK, you go ahead.

13:54.121 --> 13:56.622
- Nice buns.
- Didn't see that one coming.

13:56.623 --> 13:58.457
You're really not gonna tell on me?

13:58.458 --> 14:01.293
Of course not.
Us girls have to stick together, right?

14:01.294 --> 14:03.729
l think we own the Baron
for a couple of things.

14:03.730 --> 14:06.866
- Four between us.
- Stop it, you terrible boy.

14:06.867 --> 14:12.705
You just play your part, sweetie,
we're gonna call some friends first.

14:12.706 --> 14:15.206
lt's time, my Baron.

14:19.279 --> 14:21.779
How do l look?

14:22.315 --> 14:25.818
l can't stop pocking the slits
with my tongue, it's maddening.

14:25.819 --> 14:27.586
Be happy for the slits.

14:27.587 --> 14:33.357
The old masks were much worse
without them. You would pass out.

14:33.560 --> 14:36.128
You have no idea
what that means, do you?

14:36.129 --> 14:37.329
Sure l do.

14:37.330 --> 14:39.999
You're just having fun
with your hands, aren't you?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.867
No.

14:41.868 --> 14:45.871
All right, we're outnumbered, but we have
the element of surprise on our side.

14:45.872 --> 14:48.708
Doc, you're useless in a fight.
Just stay behind us.

14:48.709 --> 14:52.311
Hank, remember your lessons
from the judo room.

14:52.312 --> 14:56.882
Follow my lead and make sure
that you leave one alive for questioning.

14:56.883 --> 14:58.884
- You got it?
- My plan would have worked.

14:58.885 --> 15:01.385
- You got it?!
- Yes, sir.

15:05.859 --> 15:10.519
- So much for the element of surprise.
- Maybe not.

15:31.184 --> 15:33.684
Useless.

15:33.920 --> 15:37.022
- Brock, questioning?
- That's the one.

15:37.023 --> 15:39.523
Who are you working for?

15:40.293 --> 15:43.573
We know that part, Hank.
Like this.

15:43.663 --> 15:46.065
Where's the wedding being held? Talk!

15:46.066 --> 15:47.333
Go ahead!

15:47.334 --> 15:49.335
The pain will be nothing compared...

15:49.336 --> 15:53.986
to what the master
will do to me if l betray him.

15:55.208 --> 15:58.244
This is still nothing compared
to what the master...

15:58.245 --> 16:00.346
- What?
- Nothing.

16:00.347 --> 16:01.680
No, what?

16:01.681 --> 16:03.749
Well l...

16:03.750 --> 16:07.186
l don't know how
to tell you this but l...

16:07.187 --> 16:10.122
l feel a...

16:10.157 --> 16:12.024
- A lump.
- Are you serious?

16:12.025 --> 16:15.893
Yeah...you...
l'm so sorry, man.

16:17.164 --> 16:19.860
Oh, God. Oh, God.

16:19.900 --> 16:22.468
- Yeah, l just feel awful.
- How do you think l feel?

16:22.469 --> 16:25.461
Yeah, maybe we should...

16:25.505 --> 16:27.840
l must go to my wife.

16:27.841 --> 16:31.038
Yeah, yeah.
You should do that.

16:32.646 --> 16:36.315
Hey, look, l know it's a bad time
to ask and all, but...

16:36.316 --> 16:38.117
The wedding? Yeah.

16:38.118 --> 16:40.986
Yeah fine,
l don't care anymore.

16:40.987 --> 16:43.155
lt's in the observatory...

16:43.156 --> 16:46.853
another flight up through this door.

16:46.893 --> 16:47.927
Hank?!

16:47.928 --> 16:51.178
What?
l didn't get to do anything.

17:25.866 --> 17:28.366
Damn it.
What now?

17:31.738 --> 17:33.339
l'll come back for you.

17:33.340 --> 17:37.176
Hank, no. You gotta sit tight
while l figure out a way out of this.

17:37.177 --> 17:38.410
lt's OK, Brock.

17:38.411 --> 17:41.080
l know l was mixed up before
but now l'm groovy.

17:41.081 --> 17:43.949
l'm going ahead with the mission.
Lock and load.

17:43.950 --> 17:45.851
- lt's not a gun, Hank.
- Whatever.

17:45.852 --> 17:48.153
He's got an entire army, Hank.

17:48.154 --> 17:51.724
Exactly. They won't be expecting
one lone warrior.

17:51.725 --> 17:53.492
lt's just crazy enough to work!

17:53.493 --> 17:56.896
- Talk to your son, Doc.
- Boy, listen to your bodyguard.

17:56.897 --> 17:59.398
Pop, you once spent weeks in your lab.

17:59.399 --> 18:04.169
You were all alone without sleep or food,
trying desperately to isolate the gay gene.

18:04.170 --> 18:07.673
And l know you. lf it wasn't
for all the protestors and the hearings...

18:07.674 --> 18:09.742
you would have found it
and destroyed it.

18:09.743 --> 18:13.479
And why?
To keep stuff like this from happening.

18:13.480 --> 18:16.582
And Brock do you want Ünderbheit
to come and live with us?

18:16.583 --> 18:19.585
Do you really want to be
that big jerk's, pardon my French...

18:19.586 --> 18:22.588
that big jerk's bodyguard-in-law?

18:22.589 --> 18:25.387
Hank, no.
lt's suicide.

18:25.425 --> 18:27.925
Then l'll see you in heck!

18:29.663 --> 18:33.198
Thank goodness,
Hank's going to save us all.

18:33.199 --> 18:35.901
What are you so worried about?
l can make another one.

18:35.902 --> 18:37.836
Hey, maybe he'll surprise us.

18:37.837 --> 18:41.874
He does get that kind of retard strength
when he's all worked up.

18:41.875 --> 18:44.375
Help!

18:44.678 --> 18:46.712
Dr. Venture!

18:46.713 --> 18:49.949
You decided to attend
the wedding after all?

18:49.950 --> 18:54.620
l'm afraid you won't be able
to give the bride away, however...

18:54.621 --> 18:57.121
because...

18:57.691 --> 19:00.421
we're already married.

19:02.762 --> 19:06.596
Weak. Hey, pop.
Hey, Brock. You OK, Hank?

19:06.633 --> 19:08.734
Caught my tongue
on my mask.

19:08.735 --> 19:10.269
May l present to you...

19:10.270 --> 19:15.874
the eighth Baroness of Ünderland, the...
l just realized l don't know your name.

19:15.875 --> 19:17.776
lt's Dean! Dean Venture.

19:17.777 --> 19:20.045
And stop getting all big hands on me.

19:20.046 --> 19:25.848
Dean? Nein, nein,
this is not the name for a Baroness.

19:25.885 --> 19:31.355
That's because he's not a Baroness.
He's not even a woman.

19:32.058 --> 19:34.626
He's right, l'm not a woman.

19:34.627 --> 19:37.963
l'm a boy science adventurer,
like my father before me.

19:37.964 --> 19:40.466
What l wouldn't give for those.

19:40.467 --> 19:42.301
ln the name of Ünderlaw.

19:42.302 --> 19:46.062
l demand that you arrest Baron Ünderbheit.

19:46.072 --> 19:49.200
Catclops, so you survived?

19:49.242 --> 19:53.736
Wait a minute
the cat hairs in my water!

19:53.780 --> 19:55.180
Of course!

19:55.181 --> 19:58.350
Same sex marriage is illegal
under Ünderlaw, Ünderbheit.

19:58.351 --> 20:02.254
- Well, say that five times faster.
- l'm pretty sure that kid's underage, too.

20:02.255 --> 20:05.357
Well l'm...not sure that's illegal.
Anyway, it's over.

20:05.358 --> 20:08.657
Betrayer! You will pay.

20:13.833 --> 20:17.036
Mess with the cat
and you get the clops.

20:17.037 --> 20:21.877
Yeah, you mess with the Girl
and you get the Hitler.

20:22.142 --> 20:24.642
Marry me.

20:27.247 --> 20:30.347
Welcome to Michigan,
Agent Samson.

20:31.084 --> 20:34.864
That's Brock Samson,
that's who that is.

20:35.288 --> 20:37.689
Doctor Venture, wait.

20:37.690 --> 20:41.660
We wanted to thank you. The Ünderground
has all decided we shall give you this.

20:41.661 --> 20:46.965
lt is the highest honor Ünderland
can bestow upon an outlander.

20:46.966 --> 20:49.902
Thanks. But if you're trying
to butter me up for a ride...

20:49.903 --> 20:52.638
No, Dr. Venture,
Ünderland is free now.

20:52.639 --> 20:54.373
We're all going to stay.

20:54.374 --> 20:57.576
Und found a democracy,
we even picked our president.

20:57.577 --> 20:59.111
Listen, l'm flattered.

20:59.112 --> 21:00.946
Girl Hitler.

21:00.947 --> 21:03.816
Really, l'm happy for you, honey.

21:03.817 --> 21:06.752
A girl president?
How progressive!

21:06.753 --> 21:09.822
And a Hitler.
Boy, things are really looking up.

21:09.823 --> 21:12.323
Go Team Venture!

21:14.394 --> 21:17.596
So, what will happen
to Ünderbheit now?

21:17.597 --> 21:22.134
Well, we really want to soften the image
of Ünderland, so we can't execute him.

21:22.135 --> 21:27.072
So my first official act as President
is to banish the prick.

21:27.073 --> 21:30.709
You know, l'm right here.
You don't have to talk about me.

21:30.710 --> 21:33.345
We found these
when we raided the royal vaults.

21:33.346 --> 21:36.515
- l think they're yours.
- No, you didn't.

21:36.516 --> 21:40.316
Goodbye, Ventures.
Walk with God.

21:40.353 --> 21:42.454
Come back and visit us sometime!

21:42.455 --> 21:46.551
You're always welcome in Ünderland.

22:17.123 --> 22:20.163
Don't anybody get up or anything.

22:22.262 --> 22:23.562
Hi.

22:23.563 --> 22:27.503
Could l maybe, crash here for a little bit?

22:28.935 --> 22:31.435
Just got divorced.

22:32.138 --> 22:35.107
¡Qué sopa más buena!

22:36.305 --> 22:42.214
