00:02.170 --> 00:04.305
(Mindy)
THE BEST PART
OF ANY NEW RELATIONSHIP

00:04.305 --> 00:06.240
IS ALL THE FIRSTS--
THE FIRST KISS...

00:06.240 --> 00:08.142
HEY, SEXY.
FIRST OVERNIGHT...

00:08.142 --> 00:11.712
WHY DON'T YOU GET UP
ON THESE SATIN SHEETS?

00:11.712 --> 00:13.781
OH--OH, GOD. OH, GOD.
PLEASE--

00:13.781 --> 00:15.149
WHERE YOU GOING?
OH, GOD.
BABE, BABE, BABE!

00:15.149 --> 00:17.051
YEAH--OH!

00:17.051 --> 00:20.388
(Mindy)
THE FIRST TIME YOU GO THROUGH
HIS MEDICINE CABINET...

00:20.388 --> 00:22.790
THE FIRST TIME YOU CONFRONT HIM
ABOUT HIS PRESCRIPTIONS...

00:22.790 --> 00:23.724
YOU'RE ON PROZAC?

00:23.724 --> 00:25.226
I KNEW YOU WERE CRAZY.

00:25.226 --> 00:27.195
THIS IS PRILOSEC.
IT'S FOR HEARTBURN.

00:27.195 --> 00:30.098
I DON'T HAVE
MY GLASSES ON, BABE.

00:30.098 --> 00:31.832
THE FIRST TIME YOU HAVE
A CONVERSATION

00:31.832 --> 00:33.167
ABOUT PRIVACY
AND BOUNDARIES...

00:33.167 --> 00:35.603
THE FIRST TIME YOU HAVE
MAKE-UP SEX...

00:35.603 --> 00:36.804
NO MORE PLAYING AROUND.

00:36.804 --> 00:38.339
YOU'RE GONNA BE
SORE TOMORROW, BABY.

00:38.339 --> 00:40.274
WHOA! SATIN!

00:40.274 --> 00:41.675
(Mindy)
AND THE FIRST TIME
HE WANTS TO TAKE YOU AWAY

00:41.675 --> 00:43.244
ON A ROMANTIC WEEKEND GETAWAY.

00:43.244 --> 00:45.079
YOU KNOW,
I WAS THINKING MAYBE

00:45.079 --> 00:46.514
WE COULD GO SKIING
IN A COUPLE WEEKS.

00:46.514 --> 00:50.351
ON ONLINE HOOKUP SITES, "SKIING"
IS A CODE WORD FOR COCAINE.

00:50.351 --> 00:52.286
NO, ACTUAL SKIING--

00:52.286 --> 00:53.521
YOU KNOW,
KISSING ON THE CHAIRLIFT,

00:53.521 --> 00:55.256
DRINKS BY THE FIRE,

00:55.256 --> 00:57.658
THEN WE MAKE OUR WAY
OVER TO THE HOT TUB?

00:57.658 --> 00:59.193
A HOT TUB?

00:59.193 --> 01:03.231
A HOT TUB--GREAT.
I GET TO WEAR A BIKINI...

01:03.231 --> 01:04.465
IN JANUARY.

01:04.465 --> 01:07.468
[horror music]

01:12.173 --> 01:13.874
CUT EVEN-SIZED PIECES, PLEASE.
THANK YOU.

01:13.874 --> 01:16.277
OH, MY GOD.

01:16.277 --> 01:17.411
DR. L SPOTTED THE COFFEE CAKE.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.280
GET OUT OF THE WAY--WE ARE
BOWLING PINS IN HER PATH.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.682
WHAT?
I DON'T WANT COFFEE CAKE.

01:21.682 --> 01:23.817
I'M STILL FULL FROM THAT
CHIA SEED I HAD LAST NIGHT.

01:23.817 --> 01:27.188
OH, NO, I MADE AN ENTIRE
EXTRA CAKE JUST FOR YOU,

01:27.188 --> 01:27.988
LIKE YOU DEMAND.

01:27.988 --> 01:30.524
THIS BEAUTIFUL
AND MOIST COFFEE CAKE?

01:30.524 --> 01:31.792
ALL FOR ME?

01:31.792 --> 01:32.793
[chuckles]

01:32.793 --> 01:34.128
[sniffs]

01:34.128 --> 01:35.429
IT SMELLS GOOD.

01:36.464 --> 01:38.166
WHAT AM I DOING?
WHAT AM I DOING?

01:38.166 --> 01:40.301
GUYS, OVER THE HOLIDAY,
I HAD FIVE HAMS AND A GOOSE,

01:40.301 --> 01:42.303
LIKE I AM A WOLF
IN A CHILDREN'S STORY.

01:42.303 --> 01:43.637
AND GUESS WHAT.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.306
CLIFF'S GONNA HAVE TO SEE ME
IN MY BATHING SUIT SOON!

01:45.306 --> 01:47.408
JUST GET ONE WITH A SKIRT,
LIKE THE MOMS AT THE POOL.

01:47.408 --> 01:49.643
COME HERE.
WHAT?

01:49.643 --> 01:50.644
OH, MY--HEY!
HEY!

01:50.644 --> 01:51.879
WAS THAT NECESSARY?

01:51.879 --> 01:54.215
I'M NOT WEARING
A SKIRTED BATHING SUIT,

01:54.215 --> 01:55.783
LIKE SOME WOMAN
THAT GAVE UP ON LIFE!

01:55.783 --> 01:57.151
OKAY, RELAX.

01:57.151 --> 01:58.252
CLIFF HASN'T SEEN YOU NAKED?

01:58.252 --> 01:59.487
I THOUGHT HE WAS
GETTING UP IN THEM GUTS.

01:59.487 --> 02:02.156
OH, HE IS. U.T.I.-LEVEL
GETTING UP IN THEM GUTS.

02:02.156 --> 02:03.824
BUT HE HAS NEVER
SEEN ME NAKED.

02:03.824 --> 02:06.160
SEX WITHOUT NUDITY?
THAT'S THE ULTIMATE.

02:06.160 --> 02:07.161
TELL ME MORE.

02:07.161 --> 02:08.396
ALL RIGHT, LITTLE WEIRDO.

02:08.396 --> 02:10.264
WELL, I HAVE, OVER THE YEARS,
DEVISED A SERIES

02:10.264 --> 02:11.799
OF ILLUSIONS AND TRICKS

02:11.799 --> 02:14.335
SO THAT MY BOYFRIEND NEVER SEES
ME NAKED WHEN WE'RE HAVING SEX.

02:14.335 --> 02:15.703
I HIDE UNDER THE SHEETS,

02:15.703 --> 02:17.371
I PRETEND THAT
I'M REALLY INTO BLINDFOLDS,

02:17.371 --> 02:19.507
SOMETIMES I HIDE
IN THE SHADOWS OF CANDLELIGHT

02:19.507 --> 02:21.175
AND THEN I'M LIKE, "BOO!"
PHANTOM OF THE OPERA STYLE.

02:21.175 --> 02:23.244
GOD, I'M NEVER GONNA
GET INTO SHAPE.

02:23.244 --> 02:25.213
JUST EXERCISE AND EAT LESS.

02:25.213 --> 02:26.814
OKAY, SERIOUS SUGGESTIONS
ONLY, PLEASE.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.349
AND DON'T TELL ME
TO GET A PERSONAL TRAINER,

02:28.349 --> 02:30.218
'CAUSE I TRIED TO DO THAT
ON TINDER,

02:30.218 --> 02:31.752
AND NO ONE TOOK ME SERIOUSLY
'CAUSE ALL MY PHOTOS

02:31.752 --> 02:32.753
ARE OF ME EATING MEAT PIES.

02:32.753 --> 02:33.854
(Peter)
HEY, GIRL,

02:33.854 --> 02:36.190
TINDER'S FOR DATING
AND MATING

02:36.190 --> 02:37.124
AND GYRATING.

02:37.124 --> 02:38.859
IT'S NOT JUST FOR HOOKING UP,
YOU PERVS.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.394
IT'S ALSO FOR FINDING
COOL PEOPLE.

02:40.394 --> 02:42.230
YEAH, MINDY, THIS IS RIHANNA.

02:42.230 --> 02:43.964
IS IT?
TURN IT SIDEWAYS.

02:43.964 --> 02:45.899
YOU TOOK THE PICTURE
OF HER ALBUM COVER

02:45.899 --> 02:48.236
WHERE IT SAYS
"RIHANNA" ON IT.
IT SAYS
"RIHANNA."

02:48.236 --> 02:49.503
WE BEAR A PASSING RESEMBLANCE.

02:49.503 --> 02:50.971
YEAH, NOT EVEN CLOSE.

02:50.971 --> 02:52.373
MAYBE BLACK HAIR.

02:52.373 --> 02:53.374
CAN YOU HEART IT?

02:53.374 --> 02:54.708
WHOOPS.
JUST ACCIDENTALLY X'D IT.

02:54.708 --> 02:55.709
(Mindy)
DAMN IT.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.211
I'M ON TIMBER.

02:57.211 --> 02:59.680
THAT'S AN APP FOR LOGGERS
LOOKING FOR TROUBLE.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.282
HEY, DR. L,

03:01.282 --> 03:03.251
IF YOU'RE SERIOUS
ABOUT GETTING IN SHAPE,

03:03.251 --> 03:05.886
I WILL TRAIN YOU
FOR THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY.

03:05.886 --> 03:06.887
$10?

03:06.887 --> 03:09.923
THE PRICE I LIKE.
THE TRAINER I'M DUBIOUS ABOUT.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.759
NO, NO, I KNOW A LOT
ABOUT FITNESS.

03:11.759 --> 03:14.228
I WAS MR. JULY IN THE MEN'S
PRISON CALENDAR--

03:14.228 --> 03:16.230
JUST UNCLE SAM HAT, SPARKLERS,
AND NOTHING ELSE.

03:16.230 --> 03:17.698
THERE YOU GO.
THAT'S YOUR GUY RIGHT THERE.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.467
OKAY, THAT'S COMPELLING.

03:19.467 --> 03:20.801
LET'S DO IT.
YES!

03:20.801 --> 03:23.271
I WILL LET YOU BE MY TRAINER
ON A TRIAL BASIS FOR $5.

03:23.271 --> 03:24.238
I WILL PAY YOU LATER.

03:24.238 --> 03:26.574
THIS IS GOOD. I ALREADY FEEL
KIND OF CONFIDENT.

03:26.574 --> 03:27.975
YOUR HAND'S
IN THE COFFEE CAKE.

03:27.975 --> 03:29.777
OH, GOD, GET IT OFF OF ME.

03:29.777 --> 03:31.779
GUYS, I CAN TASTE
THE CINNAMON THROUGH MY SKIN!

03:31.779 --> 03:33.414
TAKE IT OUT.
I DON'T WANT TO.

03:33.414 --> 03:34.415
[sneezes]

03:34.415 --> 03:36.550
YOU DID NOT HEED
MY SIMPLE REQUESTS

03:36.550 --> 03:38.852
REGARDING THE COMMUNAL FOOD,
AND NOW I HAVE TAKEN SICK

03:38.852 --> 03:40.421
AND MUST TAKE MY ILL DAYS.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.356
OH, NO, WHAT'S WRONG?
YOU HAVE A YEAST INFECTION?

03:42.356 --> 03:43.924
DO YOU REALIZE
THAT IN MY ABSENCE,

03:43.924 --> 03:46.327
THIS OFFICE WILL BE WITHOUT
ITS ACTIVE MANAGING PARTNER?

03:46.327 --> 03:48.929
UNLESS ONE OF YOU TWO
WOULD CARE TO...

03:48.929 --> 03:50.498
NOT INTERESTED.
NO, THANKS.

03:50.498 --> 03:52.266
STEP IN AND HELP,
NO, OKAY.

03:52.266 --> 03:54.635
COOL.
SO HOW DOES THIS WORK?

03:54.635 --> 03:56.737
MANAGING AN OFFICE
ISN'T THE SAME AS JUDGING

03:56.737 --> 04:00.274
A WING-EATING COMPETITION
AT D-HOLE'S BAR AND GRILL.

04:00.274 --> 04:01.642
IT REQUIRES GRAVITAS.

04:01.642 --> 04:04.378
NO ONE IS MORE GRAVITAS
THAN ME.

04:04.378 --> 04:05.346
I'M A BORN LEADER.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.047
I WAS THE PRESIDENT
OF MY FRAT SO MANY TIMES

04:07.047 --> 04:08.616
THEY USED TO CALL ME "FDR,"

04:08.616 --> 04:11.452
AS IN, "FUN DUDE."

04:11.452 --> 04:13.321
I NEVER DID GET THE "R."

04:13.321 --> 04:15.389
[groans]
FINE. I GUESS I HAVE NO CHOICE.

04:15.389 --> 04:16.189
LISTEN UP.

04:16.189 --> 04:18.992
GUY, RELAX.
EMAIL ME THIS CRAP.

04:18.992 --> 04:19.927
OKAY?
[spits]

04:19.927 --> 04:21.795
EVERYTHING
IS GONNA BE FINE.

04:21.795 --> 04:22.963
I'M COOL...
COOL.

04:22.963 --> 04:23.964
CALM...
RIGHT.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.433
COLLECTED.
OF COURSE.

04:25.433 --> 04:26.500
I'M BARACK OBAMA.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.635
RIGHT, YOU'RE NOT
BARACK OBAMA.

04:27.635 --> 04:29.337
I'M CORY BOOKER.
YOU'RE COREY FELDMAN.

04:29.337 --> 04:32.573
I'M COREY HAIM.
HE'S DEAD.

04:32.573 --> 04:34.942
I AM SURE
YOU WILL DO WONDERFULLY.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.311
COME ON, ENGAGE YOUR NECK.
IT'S ALL IN THE NECK.

04:37.311 --> 04:38.679
COME ON, DR. L.
THERE YOU GO.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.848
WHY IS YOUR CROTCH
SO WARM ON MY KNEES?

04:40.848 --> 04:41.982
I WAS, LIKE,
SICK A FEW DAYS AGO.

04:41.982 --> 04:42.983
PLEASE STOP
TALKING ABOUT IT.

04:42.983 --> 04:43.851
OH, GOD.

04:43.851 --> 04:45.553
YOU'VE GOT THIS, DR. L!
ONLY 1,000 MORE.

04:45.553 --> 04:47.655
WHAT? HOW LONG HAVE
I BEEN DOING THIS?

04:47.655 --> 04:48.456
TWO MINUTES.

04:48.456 --> 04:49.957
HOLD ON, DID YOU
FACTOR IN THE TIME

04:49.957 --> 04:51.759
THAT IT TOOK ME TO PICK OUT
WORKOUT OUTFITS?

04:51.759 --> 04:54.562
NO. NO, I DIDN'T, AND, WELL,
IN THAT CASE, THAT'S AN HOUR.

04:54.562 --> 04:55.696
ALL RIGHT, WE DID IT.

04:55.696 --> 04:56.697
ATTABOY, CHAMP.

04:56.697 --> 04:57.698
NO, MORGAN, NO!

04:57.698 --> 04:58.499
COOL DOWN.

04:58.499 --> 04:59.800
THIS IS WHAT I WAS
WORRIED ABOUT.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.369
IT WAS SO EASY
TO CON YOU JUST THEN.

05:01.369 --> 05:02.235
OKAY, YOU GOT TO BE
TOUGH ON ME.
I GOT IT, I GOT IT.

05:02.235 --> 05:03.637
I WILL TRY TO GET OUT
OF EVERYTHING!

05:03.637 --> 05:04.872
I GOT IT.
OKAY.

05:04.872 --> 05:06.106
YOU'RE GOING DOWN.
OKAY.

05:06.106 --> 05:07.375
COME ON!
[groans]

05:07.375 --> 05:09.042
YOU'RE DISGUSTING!
YES!

05:09.042 --> 05:10.544
YOU MAKE ME SICK!
GOOD ONE!

05:10.544 --> 05:11.645

05:11.645 --> 05:13.013
AH!
OH!

05:13.013 --> 05:14.782
OKAY, YOU SPAT IN MY FACE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.049
(Mindy)
YOU'RE FIRED!
WHAT ABOUT
COOLDOWN?

05:16.049 --> 05:17.685
YOU DIDN'T EVEN
BRING SNACKS. GET OUT.

05:17.685 --> 05:18.686
IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT
PART OF THE WORKOUT, BUT--

05:18.686 --> 05:19.753
OUR TALK WAS
THE COOLDOWN.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.355
AH! SEE, I DIDN'T
STRETCH PROPERLY.

05:25.759 --> 05:29.096
BETSY, I'M GOING TO THE GYM.

05:29.096 --> 05:30.464

05:32.032 --> 05:34.502
HEY, DR. R SAID
YOU'RE IN CHARGE NOW.

05:34.502 --> 05:35.936
CONGRATULATIONS.
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

05:35.936 --> 05:38.406
WOULD IT BE OKAY IF I TOOK
THE L-SHAPED DESK IN PHLEBOTOMY?

05:38.406 --> 05:39.940
YEAH. TAKE IT.
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.742

05:48.148 --> 05:50.050
YOU TOLD MORGAN HE COULD TAKE
THE BIG DESK IN PHLEBOTOMY?

05:50.050 --> 05:52.085
NO. I TOLD HIM HE COULD
TAKE THE L-SHAPED DESK.

05:52.085 --> 05:52.886
THAT IS THE BIG DESK.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.556
OH. YOU COULD TAKE IT.
I DON'T CARE.

05:55.556 --> 05:56.790
REALLY?

06:03.130 --> 06:05.032
HEY, UM,

06:05.032 --> 06:06.567
THERE SEEMS TO BE
A LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION

06:06.567 --> 06:08.502
ABOUT WHO GETS THE L-SHAPED DESK
IN PHLEBOTOMY

06:08.502 --> 06:09.503
THAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER.

06:09.503 --> 06:10.504
IS THIS A JOKE?

06:10.504 --> 06:12.005
NO, WE'RE DEAD-ASS SERIOUS.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.942
OKAY, LOOK, THE FORMER
ADMINISTRATION'S NANNY STATE

06:14.942 --> 06:16.877

06:23.484 --> 06:26.420
YOU GAVE THE DESK TO ME.
IT'S MINE.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.589
I ONLY GAVE IT TO YOU BECAUSE I
DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD A BOYFRIEND.

06:28.589 --> 06:31.124
OH. THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A PERSONAL PROBLEM.

06:31.124 --> 06:33.627

06:56.083 --> 06:58.586
OKAY. HEY, LOOK...

06:58.586 --> 07:01.221
ONE OF THE UPSIDES TO YOUR RIGID
AND DISCIPLINED LIFESTYLE,

07:01.221 --> 07:05.493
WHICH I DETEST, IS THAT
YOU HAVE A GREAT BODY.

07:05.493 --> 07:07.895
I WORK WITH WHAT I GOT.
OKAY.

07:07.895 --> 07:10.564
WELL, I WAS WONDERING IF YOU
MIGHT CONSIDER TRAINING ME.

07:10.564 --> 07:12.232
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

07:12.232 --> 07:14.001
WHY NOT? YOU GO TO THE GYM
EVERY DAY ANYWAY.

07:14.001 --> 07:15.636
I'LL JUST FOLLOW YOU
AND JUST DO WHAT YOU DO...

07:15.636 --> 07:18.138
EXCEPT I WILL NOT DO SQUATS.
THEY ARE NOT LADYLIKE.

07:18.138 --> 07:19.740
AND I WILL NOT DO PUSH-UPS.
THEY'RE TOO HARD.

07:19.740 --> 07:20.908
WHY WOULD I WASTE MY TIME?

07:20.908 --> 07:22.643
YOU DON'T TAKE
THIS STUFF SERIOUSLY.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.111
I DO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.

07:24.111 --> 07:27.781
LOOK, DANNY, CLIFF IS
THE FIRST GUY SINCE CASEY

07:27.781 --> 07:29.850
THAT I COULD SEE
A REAL FUTURE WITH, YOU KNOW?

07:29.850 --> 07:31.585
AND YOU ONLY HAVE
ONE OPPORTUNITY

07:31.585 --> 07:32.920
TO MAKE YOUR FIRST
NAKED IMPRESSION.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.054
I DON'T WANT HIM
TO SEE MY NAKED BODY

07:34.054 --> 07:35.322
AND THEN DECIDE
HE DOESN'T LIKE ME.

07:35.322 --> 07:38.091
GUYS DON'T CARE ABOUT THIS STUFF
AS MUCH AS GIRLS THINK THEY DO.

07:38.091 --> 07:39.326
THAT'S A BUNCH OF CRAP.

07:39.326 --> 07:41.261
YOU ALL SAY THAT, AND THEN
YOU GO OUT AND DATE ASS MODELS.

07:41.261 --> 07:43.864
I AM SICK OF BEING THE PERSON
WITH THE GOOD PERSONALITY.

07:43.864 --> 07:45.766
OKAY, I WANT TO BE SO HOT
THAT CLIFF WOULD DATE ME

07:45.766 --> 07:47.134
EVEN IF I HAD
A BAD PERSONALITY.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.803
OKAY, FINE. FINE.
I'LL TRAIN YOU.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.138
YOU WILL? THANK YOU.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.773
BUT FROM THIS DAY FORWARD,
I OWN YOU.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.007
I'M GONNA MAKE
YOUR LIFE MISERABLE,

07:54.007 --> 07:55.075
AWFUL, YOU UNDERSTAND?

07:55.075 --> 07:57.077
YES, AWFUL,
LIKE ON DANCING WITH THE STARS.

07:57.077 --> 08:00.581
NO, LIKE A MARINE MOVIE WHERE A
GUY KILLS HIMSELF DURING BASIC.

08:00.581 --> 08:01.649
[spits]

08:01.649 --> 08:04.117
[sighs]
OKAY. NO MORE SPITTING.

08:09.723 --> 08:12.560
WHOA.
DANNY, THIS ISN'T A GYM.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.194
THIS IS WHERE A VILLAIN
IN A BATMAN MOVIE

08:14.194 --> 08:15.596
GOES TO PREPARE HIS BODY.

08:15.596 --> 08:16.630
IT'S OLD-SCHOOL, RIGHT?

08:16.630 --> 08:18.666
THE PLACE DIDN'T EVEN
LET WOMEN IN

08:18.666 --> 08:20.834
UNTIL MANHATTAN WENT
TINA FEY CRAZY IN 2002.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.970
HUH.
YOU READY OR WHAT?

08:22.970 --> 08:24.605
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
HOW I'M GONNA LOSE TEN POUNDS.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.674
THERE'S NO ELLIPTICALS
OR TVs WITH BRAVO ON THEM.

08:26.674 --> 08:28.275
OKAY, NO, THIS IS
A REAL GYM, OKAY?

08:28.275 --> 08:29.509
IT'S GOT EVERYTHING
YOU NEED--

08:29.509 --> 08:33.881
FREE WEIGHTS, PUNCHING BAGS,
STEAM ROOM, FAT GUY WITH A MOP.

08:33.881 --> 08:35.282
STEAM ROOM.
MM-HMM.

08:35.282 --> 08:37.184
NOW GO CHANGE INTO YOUR
WORKOUT CLOTHES. LET'S GO.

08:37.184 --> 08:38.652
UH, YOU'RE LOOKING
AT MY OUTFIT.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.554
THESE ARE PERFORMANCE
RHINESTONES.

08:40.554 --> 08:41.722
PERFORMANCE WHAT?

08:41.722 --> 08:43.190
THEY WON'T FLECK OFF
IF YOU SWEAT.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.658
YOU TRYING TO
GET ME KILLED?

08:44.658 --> 08:46.259
I'M NOT TRYING
TO GET YOU KILLED.

08:46.259 --> 08:49.262
OKAY, GO CHANGE INTO YOUR
WORKOUT CLOTHES. MOVE IT NOW.

08:49.262 --> 08:51.665
AND I AM TELLING YOU
THAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT THEM.

08:51.665 --> 08:52.600
WHAT THE HELL ARE THOSE?

08:52.600 --> 08:55.202
UH, FATSTEPS ULTRAWIDE.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.337
CHRIS CHRISTIE WEARS THEM
ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL--

08:57.337 --> 08:58.338
OUR NEXT PRESIDENT.

08:58.338 --> 08:59.940
GOOD TO KNOW.

08:59.940 --> 09:02.275
OKAY, MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS.

09:02.275 --> 09:05.846
IF IT'S HOT IN THE ROOM
THAT YOU'RE IN

09:05.846 --> 09:08.616
AND YOU FIND IT
TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE,

09:08.616 --> 09:12.285
THEN YOU SIMPLY
WALK OVER TO THE WINDOW,

09:12.285 --> 09:16.089
WHICH IS THIS CLEAR THING
THAT'S NOT A WALL OR A DOOR,

09:16.089 --> 09:18.325
AND THEN YOU OPEN IT.

09:18.325 --> 09:20.060
OKAY?
YOU DON'T NEED MY PERMISSION.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.129
WELL, DR. REED SAYS WE'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO OPEN THAT WINDOW.

09:22.129 --> 09:23.597
YEAH, DR. REED
THINKS YOU'RE GONNA

09:23.597 --> 09:24.965
FALL OUT OF THIS LIKE A BABY.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.867
I, ON THE OTHER HAND,
HAVE FAITH,

09:26.867 --> 09:28.335
ALBEIT DWINDLING,
THAT YOU WON'T.

09:28.335 --> 09:29.336
[owl squawks]

09:29.336 --> 09:30.838
OH! WHOA!

09:30.838 --> 09:32.172
HEY, OWLY'S BACK.

09:32.172 --> 09:35.175
OWLY. IT'S OKAY.
HE'S MY FRIEND.

09:35.175 --> 09:37.611
HOO. MORGAN.

09:37.611 --> 09:40.180
YOU SAY, "HOO."

09:40.180 --> 09:41.248
MORGAN!

09:41.248 --> 09:42.750
OKAY, TAKE CARE
OF THIS, PLEASE.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.685
WELL, I'M TRYING TO,
BUT HE'S NOT DOING THE BIT.

09:44.685 --> 09:47.187
OWLY, IT'S MORGAN TOOKERS.

09:47.187 --> 09:50.057
HOO. MORGAN.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.859
TAMRA, CAN YOU PLEASE
GO TO PHLEBOTOMY?

09:51.859 --> 09:54.895
AND IN MY TOP-LEFT DESK DRAWER,
THERE'S A DEAD MOUSE.

09:54.895 --> 09:59.066
SEE HOW I GO ALL THE WAY DOWN?
CHEST MEET FLOOR.

09:59.066 --> 10:00.333
NICE TO MEET YOU,
SORRY I CAN'T STAY,

10:00.333 --> 10:02.235
BUT I'LL BE BACK,
I PROMISE.

10:02.235 --> 10:04.071
HEY.
HMM?

10:04.071 --> 10:05.205
NOW YOU.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.406
DANNY.
YEAH?

10:06.406 --> 10:08.041
HOW OLD DO YOU THINK
THIS BUILDING IS?

10:08.041 --> 10:11.211
STOP CHANGING THE SUBJECT.
PUSH-UP TIME.

10:11.211 --> 10:14.715
FLOOR MEET CHEST. CHEST, FLOOR.
HI, BYE, UP.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.750
OKAY. WHEW!

10:16.750 --> 10:19.419
SO, WHEN YOU WERE A KID, DID YOU
USED TO TAKE THE BUS TO SCHOOL?

10:19.419 --> 10:21.822
NO, I WALKED.
MY MOM WAS A CROSSING GUARD.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.256
SUPER EMBARRASSING.

10:23.256 --> 10:24.858
OKAY, YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN,
YOU'RE CHANGING THE SUBJECT!

10:24.858 --> 10:26.059
COME ON, GIVE ME
A PUSH-UP.

10:26.059 --> 10:27.928
I CAN'T!
DO IT NOW!

10:27.928 --> 10:30.030
DO NOT YELL AT ME.
I DO NOT RESPOND WELL TO ANGER.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.431
THAT'S WHY I CAN'T DATE
ANY GUY FROM BOSTON.

10:31.431 --> 10:34.267
DAMN IT, HOW DO I GET THROUGH
TO SOMEONE WHOSE ONLY FOCUS

10:34.267 --> 10:36.970
IS RED-CARPET DRESSES AND SHOWS
ABOUT CELEBRITY MURDERS?

10:36.970 --> 10:38.438
YOU'RE DESCRIBING THE TWO
MOST INTERESTING THINGS

10:38.438 --> 10:39.239
IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE.

10:39.239 --> 10:41.408
OKAY, I GOT IT, OKAY?
IMAGINE THIS.

10:41.408 --> 10:43.711
YOU'RE PASSED OUT ON YOUR BED
IN THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS.

10:43.711 --> 10:46.313
THERE'S AN EARTHQUAKE, AND
LEONARDO DICAPRIO'S GREEN HOME

10:46.313 --> 10:47.314
HAS COLLAPSED ON HIM.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.749
HE NEEDS YOU TO SAVE HIM.
PUSH AWAY THE RUBBLE!

10:48.749 --> 10:49.950
I'M COMING FOR YOU, LEO.

10:49.950 --> 10:50.951
PUSH AWAY THE RUBBLE!

10:50.951 --> 10:52.019
YOU DON'T DESERVE TO DIE.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.386
GET IT DOWN! GET IT DOWN!

10:53.386 --> 10:55.155
UGH!

10:55.155 --> 10:56.690
I DID IT!
DANNY, I DID A PUSH-UP!

10:56.690 --> 10:59.092

10:59.092 --> 11:00.193

11:00.193 --> 11:01.862
I'M COMING FOR YOU, FASSY!

11:01.862 --> 11:02.930

11:02.930 --> 11:04.364

11:04.364 --> 11:05.365
AND WHAT ELSE?

11:05.365 --> 11:06.800
HIS GIANT PENIS!

11:06.800 --> 11:08.736
COME ON, ANNE HATHAWAY
IS TRAPPED UNDER A CAR.

11:08.736 --> 11:10.037
YOU GOT TO PUSH HER OUT.
COME ON, GO.

11:10.037 --> 11:12.439
[grunts]
I CAN'T.

11:12.439 --> 11:13.406
GREAT. GREAT.

11:13.406 --> 11:14.474
ANNE HATHAWAY'S DEAD.

11:14.474 --> 11:15.976
YOU KILLED
A NATIONAL TREASURE.

11:15.976 --> 11:19.279
* JUMP SO HIGH, HIGH,
SHE REACHED THE SKY *

11:19.279 --> 11:22.049
I WAS GONNA INCORPORATE YOU
INTO THE SONG.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.350
FIVE MORE!
I'M TIRED!

11:23.350 --> 11:25.719
YOU SUCK!
YOU SUCK, YOU MAGGOT!

11:25.719 --> 11:27.721
I WAS A LITTLE HARSH WITH YOU,
BUT I'M TRYING TO--

11:27.721 --> 11:28.822
YOU WANT TO BE
IN SHAPE, RIGHT?

11:28.822 --> 11:30.190
UH-UH-UH-UH.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.025
YEAH, UH-UH-UH.

11:32.025 --> 11:35.128
BREATHE, BREATHE.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.129
BEAUTIFUL.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.398
YOU GOT THIS. NICE.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.367
KEEP GOING. YES.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.368
I CAN'T, DANNY.

11:41.368 --> 11:42.302
YEAH, YOU GOT THIS, KID.

11:42.302 --> 11:43.370
I CAN'T DO ANY MORE.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.773
I'M JUST GONNA GET ON
TO SCOTT PETERSON'S BOAT.

11:45.773 --> 11:47.307
OKAY, I DIDN'T WANT
TO HAVE TO DO THIS.

11:47.307 --> 11:48.508
BUT HERE IT GOES.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.477
YOU'RE AT THE
GOLDEN GLOBES, OKAY?

11:50.477 --> 11:53.280
YOU JUST TRIPPED AND FELL
ON THE RED CARPET.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.514
NO!

11:54.514 --> 11:56.917
THE WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING.
YOU'RE FACEDOWN.

11:56.917 --> 11:58.451
YOUR DRESS IS OVER
YOUR HEAD.

11:58.451 --> 12:00.053
TOBEY MAGUIRE
IS LAUGHING AT YOU.
WHAT?

12:00.053 --> 12:01.088
THE WHOLE WORLD
IS WATCHING.

12:01.088 --> 12:02.956
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
YOU GONNA SIT THERE AND CRY?

12:02.956 --> 12:04.758
OR ARE YOU GONNA
PUSH YOURSELF UP AND SHOW THEM

12:04.758 --> 12:06.059
WHAT BEST ACTRESS

12:16.136 --> 12:17.137
[panting]
THAT WAS GREAT.

12:17.137 --> 12:18.171
DID I WIN?

12:18.171 --> 12:20.808
NO, YOU LOST
TO STOCKARD CHANNING.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.344
AHH.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.781
HELLO, STEAM ROOM.

12:27.781 --> 12:29.783

12:31.051 --> 12:32.552
AAH!
WHY ARE YOU NAKED?

12:32.552 --> 12:34.021
WHY ARE YOU
IN THE GIRLS' STEAM ROOM?

12:34.021 --> 12:35.255
IT'S CO-ED!

12:35.255 --> 12:37.490
HERE, HERE.
FINE. TAKE MY TOWEL.

12:37.490 --> 12:38.491
THAT IS SO MUCH WORSE!

12:38.491 --> 12:39.960
DON'T DROP IT
ON THE FLOOR.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.395
YOUR GENITAL SWEAT
WAS ON THAT!

12:42.395 --> 12:43.396
PICK IT UP!
IT'S MY FAVORITE TOWEL.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.032
TAKE IT.
TAKE YOUR TOWEL.

12:45.032 --> 12:46.133
MINDY, I THINK WE HAVE
A LITTLE PROBLEM.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.802
UH...
OH, OH...

12:48.802 --> 12:49.870
OW, OW, OW, OW, OW.

12:49.870 --> 12:50.737
OH, SORRY, SORRY,
SORRY, SORRY, SORRY!

12:50.737 --> 12:52.539
WHY DID YOU WEAR A WATCH
TO A STEAM ROOM?

12:52.539 --> 12:54.474
THIS IS A $35 WATCH.

12:54.474 --> 12:55.542
I'M NOT GONNA LEAVE IT
IN THE LOCKER ROOM.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.377
OH, GOD.
JUST TURN.

12:57.377 --> 12:58.511
JUST TURN.
OH, MY GOD,

12:58.511 --> 13:00.147

DON'T USE ME FOR LEVERAGE!

13:00.147 --> 13:02.582
THIS IS NOTHING!

13:08.121 --> 13:09.489

[screams]

13:12.826 --> 13:14.594
I FEAR THAT BECAUSE
YOU'VE SEEN ME NAKED,

13:14.594 --> 13:16.529
I THINK IT'S JUST GOING TO BE
NOT VERY PROFESSIONAL AT WORK

13:16.529 --> 13:17.965
AND THAT YOU SHOULD QUIT.

13:17.965 --> 13:21.301
OKAY, IT WAS ALL STEAMY.
I BARELY SAW ANYTHING.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.336
OKAY, I WOULDN'T NOTICE YOU
ON A TOPLESS BEACH.

13:23.336 --> 13:24.504
REALLY?
I PROMISE.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.039
UGH, GREAT.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.275
NOW, A BOTTOMLESS BEACH...

13:28.275 --> 13:30.377
THAT'S ANOTHER STORY.
OH, MY GOD!

13:30.377 --> 13:31.979
WHAT, I'M JOKING.
I WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU.

13:31.979 --> 13:33.613
I MEAN, MAYBE
A LITTLE BIT, BUT--

13:33.613 --> 13:34.848
ANYWAY, HERE'S THE POINT.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.950
LOOK, IF YOU'RE STILL WORRIED
ABOUT LOOKING GOOD FOR CLIFF...

13:36.950 --> 13:38.251
YEAH?

13:38.251 --> 13:40.420
LET ME GIVE YOU A PIECE
OF ADVICE ABOUT YOUR BODY

13:40.420 --> 13:42.322
BASED ON MY OBSERVATIONS

13:42.322 --> 13:45.058
NOW THAT I...
KNOW THINGS.

13:45.058 --> 13:46.193
"EXQUEEZE" ME?

13:46.193 --> 13:48.395
FIRST OF ALL,
IT WAS TRAUMATIZING ENOUGH

13:48.395 --> 13:50.063
THAT YOU SAW MY NAKED BODY
AGAINST MY WILL,

13:50.063 --> 13:52.065
AND NOW YOU WANT
TO GIVE ME NOTES?

13:52.065 --> 13:53.466
WELL, I HAVE NOTES
FOR YOU, MY FRIEND.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.302
YOUR FACE, PRETTY GOOD.

13:55.302 --> 13:57.905
LEGS, STUNNING.
FEET, DISGUSTING.

13:57.905 --> 13:59.539
THAT IS TOO FAR, OKAY?

13:59.539 --> 14:01.208
MY TOE--
NURSE.

14:01.208 --> 14:02.976
THANK YOU.
HI.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.411
MY TOENAILS ARE FINE.

14:04.411 --> 14:06.046
LOOK, I'M JUST--
YOU'RE THE ONE CONCERNED

14:06.046 --> 14:07.380
WITH YOUR NAKED
FIRST IMPRESSION.

14:07.380 --> 14:08.916
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.283
YOU KNOW HOW
YOU CAN HELP ME?

14:10.283 --> 14:12.152
YOU CAN HELP ME BY FORGETTING
YOU EVER SAW ME NAKED.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.520
ALL RIGHT? YOU WILL
SUPPRESS THIS MEMORY,

14:13.520 --> 14:14.687
THE WAY THAT YOU
SUPPRESSED THE MEMORY

14:14.687 --> 14:16.656
OF YOUR PRIEST MOLESTING YOU
WHEN YOU WERE AN ALTAR BOY.

14:16.656 --> 14:17.958
THAT NEVER HAPPENED.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.492
PERFECT.

14:21.895 --> 14:24.164
IT NEVER HAPPENED.

14:24.164 --> 14:26.066
(Morgan)
HAVE YOU BEEN
TO THE BEACH IN WINTER?

14:26.066 --> 14:27.567
'CAUSE IT'S AMAZING.
IT'S NOT CROWDED.

14:27.567 --> 14:28.568
OH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.170
DR. P, HEY, UH,
GOOD NEWS--

14:30.170 --> 14:31.271
THE OWL IS OUT
OF THE KITCHEN.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.373
WOW. THAT'S FANTASTIC.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.343
HEY. TAMRA, YOU GOT
THE GLOVES I WANTED.

14:36.343 --> 14:37.344
OBAMA BUMP.

14:37.344 --> 14:38.912
BOOM.

14:38.912 --> 14:40.380
WHERE DO YOU WANT
THE REST OF THE BOXES?

14:40.380 --> 14:42.149
I'M SORRY.
THE REST?

14:42.149 --> 14:46.019
YEAH.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.054
TAMRA.

14:47.054 --> 14:48.922
YOU ORDERED
1,000 BOXES OF GLOVES?

14:48.922 --> 14:51.424
I ASKED FOR 1,000 GLOVES.
YOU ORDERED 1 MILLION GLOVES.

14:51.424 --> 14:54.027
[laughs]
ON THE RIDE OVER HERE,
WE WERE JOKING ABOUT--

14:54.027 --> 14:55.996
WITH ALL THIS RUBBER, WE THOUGHT
IT'D BE A GERMAN SOCIAL CLUB.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.030
OH, YOU'VE GOT JOKES.

14:57.030 --> 14:58.598
ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOU'RE THE KING OF QUEENS?

14:58.598 --> 14:59.967
(Tamra)
YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:59.967 --> 15:00.833
I'M NOT FINDING THIS TO BE

15:00.833 --> 15:02.335
A VERY SUPPORTIVE
WORK ENVIRONMENT.

15:02.335 --> 15:03.703
I'MA GO CLEAR MY HEAD.
WAIT--

15:03.703 --> 15:06.339
DR. P...

15:06.339 --> 15:07.975
(Peter)
MORE BOXES!
MORE GLOVES!

15:07.975 --> 15:09.476
(Morgan)
DR. P...

15:13.146 --> 15:16.083
[laughter]

15:16.083 --> 15:17.284
(Jeremy)
GIRLS, IS THAT THE MAN
WITH YOUR COW COSTUME?

15:17.284 --> 15:18.651
PETER, PETER.

15:18.651 --> 15:20.620
DON'T LOOK AT THESE.
GO AWAY. STOP.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.022
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:22.022 --> 15:24.691
[coughs]
I'M SO CONTAGIOUS.

15:24.691 --> 15:25.792
YOU'RE NOT EVEN "FEVED" UP?

15:25.792 --> 15:26.659
YOU'RE JUST SITTING AT HOME
PLAYING NOOKIE HOOKY?

15:26.659 --> 15:29.963
I NEED THIS, PETER.
I NEED SOME ME TIME.

15:29.963 --> 15:33.033
WELL, I'M SORRY.
IT SUCKS FOR YOU.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.168
I JUST FIGURED OUT
THAT MANAGING BLOWS

15:35.168 --> 15:36.503
AND I'M NO GOOD AT IT.

15:36.503 --> 15:37.504
LISTEN, PETER,

15:37.504 --> 15:40.040
MANAGING TURNED ME
FROM AN INTERNATIONAL LOTHARIO

15:40.040 --> 15:42.042
INTO A LARD-FILLED
FOOD CREATURE.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.011
NO. DID YOU GAIN
ANY WEIGHT?

15:44.011 --> 15:46.213
NOT TO MENTION THE CONSTANT
DELUGE OF DISRESPECT.

15:46.213 --> 15:47.747
I DO WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT DANNY.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.016
HE'S GOT A REAL
ATTITUDE PROBLEM.

15:49.016 --> 15:50.450
BUT THAT'S THE JOB.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.352
THERE'S NO EASY
OR FUN WAY TO DO IT

15:52.352 --> 15:54.154
WHERE EVERYBODY
LIKES YOU ALL THE TIME.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.056
BUT IF YOU DON'T
MAKE THEM RESPECT YOU,

15:56.056 --> 15:57.524
THEY WILL DESTROY YOU.

15:57.524 --> 15:59.192
REMEMBER THAT, PETER.

15:59.192 --> 16:00.727
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

16:00.727 --> 16:02.996
MY NURSES HAVE
A FEW MORE TESTS TO RUN.

16:02.996 --> 16:03.997
GROSS.

16:03.997 --> 16:07.167
I CERTAINLY HOPE SO.
YEAH.

16:20.513 --> 16:21.514
HEY, BETSY,

16:21.514 --> 16:23.783
I'M ON A VERY PRIVATE
PHONE CALL FOR TEN MINUTES

16:23.783 --> 16:26.319
DON'T INTERRUPT ME.

16:35.095 --> 16:37.730
OH, HELLO, CLIFF. WON'T YOU
JOIN ME IN THE HOT TUB?

16:37.730 --> 16:40.167
NO PROBLEM.
I'LL JUST BE IN THE NUDE.

16:40.167 --> 16:44.237
SCREW YOU, DANNY.
I LOOK GREAT.

16:44.237 --> 16:45.038
[owl chirps]

16:45.038 --> 16:48.075
[screams]
OH! OH, GOD! OH, GOD!

16:48.075 --> 16:49.076
WHAT'S GOING ON?

16:49.076 --> 16:50.077
WHOA! WHOA!

16:50.077 --> 16:51.111
THE BIRD!

16:51.111 --> 16:52.245
WAAH!
AAH!

16:52.245 --> 16:53.780
WHOA!
AH! THE BIRD!

16:53.780 --> 16:54.781
AH!
AH!

16:54.781 --> 16:55.848
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

16:55.848 --> 16:58.185
CLOSE THE DOOR! CLOSE THE DOOR!
CLOSE THE DOOR!

16:58.185 --> 16:59.486
NOT WITH YOU
ON THE INSIDE!

16:59.486 --> 17:01.254
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
GET OUT! GET OUT!

17:01.254 --> 17:04.824
DO YOU WANT ME OUT OF THE OFFICE
OR THE BUILDING, IN GENERAL?

17:04.824 --> 17:06.759
'CAUSE I--YOU JUST GOT TO BE
CLEAR WITH ME RIGHT NOW.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.195
GET OUT OF HERE
AND CLOSE THE DOOR...

17:08.195 --> 17:09.596
BEHIND YOU.

17:09.596 --> 17:12.599
OKAY, I'M GOING. I'M NOT
LOOKING. I'M A GENTLEMAN.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.434
I'M GOING.
GREAT. THANK YOU.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.269
IF I CATCH THE BIRD,
YOU WANT ME TO BRING IT BACK?

17:16.269 --> 17:17.270
I'M GOING TO KILL YOU.

17:17.270 --> 17:20.107
OKAY.

17:20.107 --> 17:21.274
MINDY.

17:21.274 --> 17:22.809
NOW THAT I'VE
SEEN EVERYTHING,

17:22.809 --> 17:24.511
I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS
YOU COULD WORK ON

17:24.511 --> 17:26.313
I'D LIKE TO
POINT OUT TO YOU.
[screams]

17:29.316 --> 17:30.583
SO I'M WATCHING
SLEEPY HOLLOW, RIGHT? OW.

17:30.583 --> 17:33.086
AND THE GUY--
WHAT'S HIS NAME AGAIN? OW.

17:33.086 --> 17:35.155
YOU KNOW, THE MAIN GUY?
MM-HMM.

17:35.155 --> 17:37.290
UM, FRASIER CRANE?
NO. ICHABOD JONES?

17:37.290 --> 17:39.292
TAMRA.
ANYWAY, HE--

17:39.292 --> 17:41.228
CAN YOU PLEASE BE COOL
AND COME BACK TO WORK NOW?

17:41.228 --> 17:42.095
JUST...

17:42.095 --> 17:44.197
CAN YOU PLEASE BE COOL
AND APOLOGIZE

17:44.197 --> 17:45.565
FOR YELLING AT ME
ABOUT THOSE GLOVES?

17:45.565 --> 17:46.766
YOU ORDERED A MILLION GLOVES!

17:46.766 --> 17:48.268
THAT'S A MISTAKE
YOU SHOULD'VE CAUGHT.

17:48.268 --> 17:50.303
THIS TACK
ISN'T WORKING FOR ME.

17:50.303 --> 17:51.304
CONTINUE, TINO.

17:51.304 --> 17:54.507
TINO, DO NOT CONTINUE.

17:54.507 --> 17:55.808
TAMRA, YOU GET
BACK TO WORK NOW,

17:55.808 --> 17:56.943
OR YOU DON'T COME BACK
TO WORK AT ALL.

17:56.943 --> 17:59.379
OR WHAT, YOU GONNA TAKE ME DOWN
LIKE THAT BAG OF CHIPS?

17:59.379 --> 18:00.413
I'M STRESS-EATING!

18:00.413 --> 18:02.315
[chuckles]
NOW GET BACK TO WORK!

18:02.315 --> 18:04.117
JUST CHARGE IT TO
SHULMAN & ASSOCIATES, TINO.

18:04.117 --> 18:05.385
THANK YOU.

18:05.385 --> 18:07.154
TINO, SO HELP ME GOD, YOU CHARGE
THIS TO SHULMAN & ASSOCIATES,

18:07.154 --> 18:10.423
I'LL BURN THIS WHOLE PLACE
TO THE GROUND.

18:10.423 --> 18:13.326
PETER, SORRY TO LEAVE YOU
SO ILL-PREPARED AGAIN.

18:13.326 --> 18:14.827
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT,
MR. BEAN.

18:14.827 --> 18:16.329
WELL, MR. BEAN DOESN'T TALK,

18:16.329 --> 18:18.465
SO, I MEAN, BASIL FAWLTY
WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE.

18:18.465 --> 18:19.466
(Morgan)
DR. P...

18:19.466 --> 18:22.902
I FOUND OWLY,
AND I WRAPPED HIM IN A TOWELY.

18:22.902 --> 18:24.871
I THINK WE SHOULD KEEP HIM.
WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU--DON'T--

18:24.871 --> 18:27.140
DR. P, DR. P,
WHERE YOU GOING?

18:27.140 --> 18:28.141
NO!
[owl chirps]

18:28.141 --> 18:29.342
HE'S FLYING SOUTH!

18:29.342 --> 18:30.777
YOU, CALL MAINTENANCE
RIGHT NOW.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.780
TELL THEM THE HEAT
NEEDS TO BE FIXED IMMEDIATELY.

18:33.780 --> 18:37.384
EVERYBODY, DR. REED HAS RETURNED
TO BE ACTIVE MANAGER!

18:37.384 --> 18:39.152
PLEASE GIVE HIM
A ROUND OF APPLAUSE.

18:39.152 --> 18:40.587
[applause]
THANK YOU.
A ROUND OF APPLAUSE.

18:40.587 --> 18:44.191
GOOD. NOW, IF I HEAR
OF ANYBODY DISRESPECTING

18:44.191 --> 18:47.660
THIS KIND,
PATIENT, SMART,

18:47.660 --> 18:51.398
WELL-DRESSED,
FIT DOCTOR...
THANKS.

18:51.398 --> 18:54.367
I WILL JIM HENSON YOU
INTO APOLOGIZING.

18:54.367 --> 18:55.368
IS THAT CLEAR?

18:55.368 --> 18:56.536
YES, DR. PRENTICE.

18:56.536 --> 18:58.338
YES, YES.
ABSOLUTELY, YES.

18:58.338 --> 18:59.806
GREAT.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.174
DR. P, YOU'RE A GOON!

19:01.174 --> 19:02.375
Y'ALL KNOW THE DEAL-Y!

19:02.375 --> 19:05.312
EVERYBODY SHUT UP!

19:05.312 --> 19:07.647
SHE'S RIGHT.
WHY IS IT ALL FLAKY?

19:07.647 --> 19:09.216
YEAH, WHOA!

19:09.216 --> 19:10.383
OH, HELLO.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:10.383 --> 19:12.319
DID YOU HEAR THAT SOUND?
I DID.

19:12.319 --> 19:14.354
THAT IS THE SOUND
OF A KNOCK, DANNY.
I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

19:14.354 --> 19:15.588
THAT IS WHAT WE DO
IN CIVILIZED SOCIETY

19:15.588 --> 19:16.956
WHEN WE WANT
TO ENTER A ROOM.

19:16.956 --> 19:18.458
WHOA, MINDY, IS THAT YOU?

19:18.458 --> 19:20.193
I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU
WITH YOUR CLOTHES ON.

19:20.193 --> 19:22.429
THAT'S MY HILARIOUS LINE
FROM WIENER NIGHT.

19:22.429 --> 19:25.765
GET AN ORIGINAL ZING
FOR ONCE IN YOUR LI--

19:25.765 --> 19:27.634
DID YOU WRITE IT DOWN?
NO.

19:27.634 --> 19:29.336
LOOK, JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE,
LIKE, 0% BODY FAT

19:29.336 --> 19:32.205
AND ONLY EAT THREE MEALS A DAY
AND BARELY EVER SNACK

19:32.205 --> 19:33.406
DOESN'T MEAN THAT
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT

19:33.406 --> 19:34.274
TO TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG
WITH MY BODY.

19:34.274 --> 19:37.310
I AM YOUR PERSONAL TRAINER.
BODY BY DAN.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.446
MORE LIKE BODY BY FIRED,
'CAUSE YOU'RE FIRED.

19:39.446 --> 19:40.613
WHAT?
OH, YEAH.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.549
AND FOR THE RECORD,
THERE IS NOTHING

19:42.549 --> 19:44.651
THAT YOU CAN CRITICIZE
ABOUT THIS SITUATION

19:44.651 --> 19:46.319
THAT I HAVEN'T
ALREADY HEARD

19:46.319 --> 19:48.321
FROM EVERY SINGLE MEAN GIRL
FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE.

19:48.321 --> 19:49.789
WHAT SITUATION?

19:49.789 --> 19:51.358
I'M NOT--OKAY, FINE.
YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:51.358 --> 19:52.859
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
MENTIONED IT.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.794
I KNOW THAT I COULD
LOSE 15 POUNDS.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.296
I KNOW.

19:56.296 --> 19:58.231
I DON'T HAVE THIS PERFECT,
SKINNY, HOT BODY

19:58.231 --> 19:59.632
LIKE ALL THE GIRLS
THAT YOU DATE.

19:59.632 --> 20:00.533
I KNOW THAT ONE OF MY BOOBS

20:00.533 --> 20:02.402
IS CRAZILY BIGGER
THAN THE OTHER ONE.

20:02.402 --> 20:03.803
DON'T LOOK. I KNOW THAT I HAVE
UPPER KNEE FAT.

20:03.803 --> 20:05.572
AND I KNOW THAT I HAVE
A SCAR ON MY BACK

20:05.572 --> 20:06.706
THAT LOOKS LIKE A SWASTIKA.

20:06.706 --> 20:07.874
YOU DON'T THINK
THAT'S COME UP

20:07.874 --> 20:09.442
EVERY SINGLE TIME
I'VE DATED A JEWISH GUY?

20:09.442 --> 20:11.344
YOU HAVE ONE?
A JEWISH GUY
IN MY LIFE, OR--

20:11.344 --> 20:12.312
NO, A SWASTIKA.

20:12.312 --> 20:13.346
YES! THE LATTER.

20:13.346 --> 20:14.581
I DIDN'T EVER NOTICE THAT.

20:14.581 --> 20:17.484
MAYBE YOU COULD GET CATARACT
SURGERY, OLD MAN.

20:17.484 --> 20:20.019
MY EYES ARE FI--
LOOK, OKAY.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.488
I GET IT.
YOU'RE SELF-CONSCIOUS.

20:21.488 --> 20:23.323
I UNDERSTAND,
BUT YOU HAVE NO REASON TO BE.

20:23.323 --> 20:26.626
ALL I WAS GONNA SAY IS DON'T
SUCK IN YOUR STOMACH SO MUCH.

20:26.626 --> 20:27.827
IT MAKES YOU...

20:27.827 --> 20:31.398
IT MAKES YOU LOOK NERVOUS AND,
FRANKLY, A LITTLE CONSTIPATED.

20:31.398 --> 20:32.765
AND GET A BOOB JOB.

20:32.765 --> 20:35.402
NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY.

20:35.402 --> 20:37.370
AND GET RID OF THE CELLULITE
ON YOUR LEGS.

20:37.370 --> 20:38.638
NO.

20:38.638 --> 20:39.706
AND HAVE BLUE EYES.

20:39.706 --> 20:41.341
I DON'T WANT THAT.

20:41.341 --> 20:42.675
OH.

20:42.675 --> 20:47.480
YOU'RE A WOMAN, AND THAT'S GOOD.
LOOK LIKE A WOMAN.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.548
OKAY.

20:48.548 --> 20:51.684
THAT'S MY OPINION
AS YOUR TRAINER.

20:54.721 --> 20:56.055
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

20:56.055 --> 20:57.724
OKAY.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.726
UM, SORRY I CAME IN HERE
A LITTLE HOT.

20:59.726 --> 21:01.394
THAT'S OKAY.

21:01.394 --> 21:03.363
I-I APPRECIATE THAT.

21:03.363 --> 21:06.933
AND ALSO, REGARDING...

21:06.933 --> 21:08.435
[clicks tongue]

21:08.435 --> 21:11.304
NO, NO. NO, NO.
DON'T NEED ANY ADVICE ON THAT.

21:11.304 --> 21:12.839
OKAY, JUST GROW IT OUT.
NO ONE WANTS A NINE-YEAR-OLD.

21:12.839 --> 21:13.840
I MEAN, IF CLIFF DOES,

21:13.840 --> 21:15.675
THEN HE'S GOT A SERIOUS PROBLEM.
GET RID OF HIM.

21:15.675 --> 21:17.377
SO YOU LIKE IT...

21:17.377 --> 21:18.545
LUSH?

21:18.545 --> 21:20.046
CONVERSATION'S OVER.
I DON'T--

21:20.046 --> 21:20.947
YOU HAVE VERY
EUROPEAN TASTES, DANNY.

21:20.947 --> 21:23.383
OKAY.
FOR A MAN
WHO HATES EUROPE--

21:23.383 --> 21:24.517
BYE-BYE, GOT WORK TO DO.

21:24.517 --> 21:26.919
VERY '70s, DANNY.
OKAY, THANK YOU.

21:26.919 --> 21:28.621
CATCH YOU ON
THE FLIPPY-FLIP.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.357
WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG
WITH MY FEET?
