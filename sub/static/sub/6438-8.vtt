WEBVTT

00:03.910 --> 00:08.113
We shall see Roman blood
upon fucking snow!

00:08.180 --> 00:10.783
I will not march my people
to the afterlife.

00:10.851 --> 00:15.020
And I will not die with
a Roman sword in my back.

00:16.224 --> 00:19.194
I have warned you to stay
far from men of my kind.

00:19.261 --> 00:21.396
You have known pain and loss.

00:21.464 --> 00:23.198
A misfortune shared
by many among us.

00:23.265 --> 00:25.300
Hold command beneath Tiberius.

00:25.368 --> 00:27.703
Not a boy prone
to losing his sword.

00:27.771 --> 00:30.039
Here we stand,
you beneath heel.

00:31.275 --> 00:32.943
I am to remain in Sinuessa?

00:33.011 --> 00:33.944
In this very villa.

00:34.012 --> 00:34.979
Beneath Tiberius.

00:35.047 --> 00:36.414
I know how much
he cares for you.

00:37.883 --> 00:40.385
She was desperate to break
word with your father.

00:40.453 --> 00:42.320
What concerns so move her?

00:42.388 --> 00:43.688
Ah, that is the mystery.

00:43.756 --> 00:46.258
Was my slave escorted
back to Sinuessa?

00:46.326 --> 00:48.294
She has moved
to join the rebellion.

00:48.361 --> 00:50.129
The rebels have
breached the wall.

00:50.197 --> 00:51.397
We must fall back!

00:51.465 --> 00:54.166
The mighty Crassus
flees from us!

00:54.234 --> 00:55.901
He will return.

01:46.460 --> 01:48.428
Spartacus!

01:48.495 --> 01:51.097
Romans set again
upon rear position!

02:39.146 --> 02:41.080
Crixus!

02:52.970 --> 02:55.939
Is that all Rome has
to offer this day?!

02:59.043 --> 03:02.079
I have not yet had
my fill of blood!

03:03.460 --> 03:05.683
Crassus lays assault
twice upon a day.

03:05.751 --> 03:06.984
Yet with but a handful of men.

03:07.052 --> 03:08.052
He seeks but time
for his legions

03:08.119 --> 03:09.586
to narrow gap between us,

03:09.654 --> 03:12.690
knowing we will slow to protect
those weakest among us.

03:12.757 --> 03:15.626
A strategy taking firmest hold.

03:15.694 --> 03:20.265
Tell your gods that
Crixus pisses upon them.

03:20.333 --> 03:22.334
Crixus.

03:22.401 --> 03:24.361
I would break words while
he is yet of this world.

03:25.738 --> 03:28.574
How many days march does Crassus
find himself to our backs?

03:28.642 --> 03:31.344
Stroke cock, you fucking slave!

03:31.411 --> 03:34.313
See his tongue
made more agreeable.

03:38.785 --> 03:40.052
Four days!

03:40.120 --> 03:41.053
<i>Four days!</i>

03:41.121 --> 03:43.288
Four days.

03:43.356 --> 03:44.289
<i>Please.</i>

03:44.357 --> 03:47.259
Gather weapons,
and rejoin march.

03:47.327 --> 03:48.260
I gave what was asked!

03:48.328 --> 03:50.229
I beg of you, spare my life!

03:52.031 --> 03:53.532
You beg the wrong man.

04:21.326 --> 04:25.563
Gone to grass three days past,
by rot and stench.

04:25.631 --> 04:26.564
We gained another day
on Spartacus.

04:26.632 --> 04:27.565
<i>Halt!</i>

04:27.633 --> 04:29.067
Is it a wonder?

04:29.135 --> 04:31.169
The men have barely
rested since Melia Ridge.

04:31.237 --> 04:32.504
Nor will they find
such this night.

04:32.571 --> 04:34.238
Give command to second legion
to fall from rest,

04:34.306 --> 04:36.774
<i>and continue pursuit in advance</i>
<i>of fullest number.</i>

04:36.842 --> 04:37.975
You push them too hard.

04:38.043 --> 04:40.745
Now is not the time for gentle
words nor soft intent.

04:40.813 --> 04:43.415
I harden towards
future conflict.

04:43.482 --> 04:44.950
<i>Yet a legion on</i>
<i>the brink of collapse</i>

04:45.017 --> 04:47.318
is ill thought towards
Spartacus and his army.

04:47.386 --> 04:49.254
Any within ranks unable
to keep pace

04:49.321 --> 04:51.356
shall be struck down
where they stand.

04:51.424 --> 04:52.785
Was decimation not
threat enough --

04:52.825 --> 04:55.961
I will not let him slip
from fucking grasp!

04:56.029 --> 04:57.329
Imperator.

04:57.397 --> 04:59.965
Senator Metellus
demands audience.

05:01.568 --> 05:02.801
Metellus?

05:04.871 --> 05:06.671
You dispatch me to Rome to crow

05:06.739 --> 05:09.541
of the inevitable fall
of Spartacus upon Melia Ridge,

05:09.609 --> 05:13.278
only to have recent news
brand me overreaching fool!

05:13.345 --> 05:15.413
I find your tone displeasing.

05:15.481 --> 05:18.983
As I find of many things
swirling about failed campaign.

05:19.051 --> 05:20.985
Spartacus but prolongs his end.

05:21.053 --> 05:22.414
Return to Rome
and deliver message.

05:22.455 --> 05:24.422
I am a Senator of the Republic!

05:24.490 --> 05:25.957
Not fucking message boy
to deliver

05:26.025 --> 05:28.393
yet more tidings
of imagined victories.

05:28.461 --> 05:31.030
You stand what I deem necessary.

05:31.097 --> 05:34.366
Or has our arrangement
slipped from mind?

05:35.869 --> 05:37.836
Keep promise of villa
in Sinuessa

05:37.904 --> 05:40.372
<i>and purse lined with</i>
<i>the coin of taxes!</i>

05:40.439 --> 05:42.107
<i>Association with</i>
<i>the name of Crassus</i>

05:42.174 --> 05:44.676
will only serve
to further taint my own.

05:46.612 --> 05:49.180
Nothing has fallen to change.

05:50.816 --> 05:51.749
I shall grind Spartacus

05:51.817 --> 05:53.518
and his rebellion beneath heel,

05:53.586 --> 05:55.019
as I have promised.

05:55.087 --> 05:57.556
Lofty words coming from a man
whose most trusted slave

05:57.624 --> 05:59.892
<i>is said to have fled</i>
<i>to join the rebel king --</i>

06:02.963 --> 06:04.463
Stay from argument.

06:07.767 --> 06:10.602
You have lost fucking mind!

06:10.670 --> 06:11.870
<i>I will see the Senate</i>
<i>cast you out</i>

06:11.938 --> 06:14.072
<i>for laying hands upon</i>
<i>honored member --</i>

06:15.141 --> 06:16.341
You...

06:16.409 --> 06:17.342
will do...

06:17.410 --> 06:18.343
as I...

06:18.411 --> 06:20.045
fucking...

06:20.112 --> 06:21.746
command!

06:25.685 --> 06:28.587
Marcus.

06:28.655 --> 06:29.855
Return to Rome.

06:29.923 --> 06:32.191
Speak of this,
or any word against me...

06:32.259 --> 06:34.360
and I shall devote
fortune towards your death

06:34.428 --> 06:36.162
in darkness of night.

06:41.002 --> 06:43.136
<i>See him upon his horse.</i>

06:43.204 --> 06:46.139
And second legion set to purpose
towards Spartacus.

06:52.781 --> 06:55.916
Give word to stand ready
to move upon a moments notice.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.750
We must not fall
to sense of comfort.

06:57.818 --> 06:59.619
I do not favor
fleeing like rabbits

06:59.687 --> 07:01.788
at imagined footfall of hunter.

07:01.856 --> 07:02.856
Nor I.

07:02.924 --> 07:04.404
Yet we must stay
in advance of Crassus

07:04.425 --> 07:05.892
until numbers are replenished.

07:05.960 --> 07:07.193
A wise path.

07:07.261 --> 07:09.196
Though one paved with Roman
heads fucking preferred.

07:09.263 --> 07:11.899
We shall find our own upon it,
if we fall from caution.

07:11.966 --> 07:14.234
A word once unfamiliar
upon your tongue.

07:14.302 --> 07:17.204
Spoken now with thought towards
those less able among us.

07:17.272 --> 07:20.406
And yet they devour as much
as any man of sword or spear.

07:20.474 --> 07:22.642
<i>He is not wrong in this.</i>

07:22.710 --> 07:23.750
Supplies are nearly spent.

07:23.777 --> 07:24.744
Soon hunger will
again be upon us,

07:24.812 --> 07:26.112
weighing each step.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.515
Gannicus.

07:29.583 --> 07:30.817
<i>Gather Lugo and scout ahead.</i>

07:30.884 --> 07:33.853
I would know of any opportunity
towards grain or meat.

07:33.921 --> 07:35.689
<i>We cannot run for an eternity.</i>

07:35.757 --> 07:37.191
One day soon we will once again

07:37.259 --> 07:39.193
have to stand and fight.

07:42.264 --> 07:43.731
One day.

07:45.634 --> 07:47.969
You know he holds right in this.

07:48.037 --> 07:51.573
No ground held is certain,
in times of war.

08:03.854 --> 08:06.656
Is it possible?

08:06.724 --> 08:09.258
To slip from jaws
of Crassus yet again?

08:09.326 --> 08:11.026
I will not see you
caught between them.

08:14.431 --> 08:15.951
I have been overreaching
in my efforts,

08:15.999 --> 08:18.101
and would share.

08:18.168 --> 08:20.570
If you are of a mind...?

08:20.637 --> 08:22.138
Fuck!

08:26.143 --> 08:27.310
See fire to life.

08:27.378 --> 08:29.445
And know my eyes are upon you.

08:34.118 --> 08:36.052
His stare yet holds
the promise of violence.

08:36.120 --> 08:37.553
Continue to prove yourself
against the Romans,

08:37.621 --> 08:38.855
and see it soften.

08:38.922 --> 08:41.557
The man need not fall
to worry in such regard.

08:41.625 --> 08:43.760
Yet in matters nearer the heart,

08:43.828 --> 08:45.962
his concerns are well founded.

08:47.098 --> 08:48.131
Rid yourself of them.

08:48.199 --> 08:49.999
And break no more upon subject.

08:51.869 --> 08:54.904
If you had laughed
carelessly at my words,

08:54.972 --> 08:57.741
I would have known
feelings misplaced.

08:57.809 --> 08:59.576
<i>Yet you froth and foam,</i>

08:59.644 --> 09:02.746
showing they strike
reflective chord.

09:04.282 --> 09:06.750
You mistake reflection
for your own.

09:06.818 --> 09:11.489
And do I mistake your eyes
stealing glance as I pass?

09:12.857 --> 09:15.593
<i>Or breath from lips catching</i>
<i>when I draw near?</i>

09:19.064 --> 09:21.699
I had feared night
spent beneath open sky.

09:21.767 --> 09:23.734
Gratitude.

09:23.802 --> 09:24.736
A thing of little note.

09:24.803 --> 09:25.904
Little?

09:25.971 --> 09:27.305
It was but short time past
you would have found joy

09:27.373 --> 09:28.506
in my suffering.

09:28.574 --> 09:30.294
Do not think me so far
removed from thought.

09:30.342 --> 09:31.609
Then why offer hand?

09:31.677 --> 09:33.211
<i>I offer it towards Spartacus.</i>

09:33.278 --> 09:34.445
It baffles fucking sense,

09:34.513 --> 09:36.547
yet he appears to carry
affection towards you.

09:38.483 --> 09:42.853
I-I've have not the words --

09:42.921 --> 09:44.088
Nor I desire to hear them.

09:47.593 --> 09:51.062
Spartacus has sacrificed much
in this life.

09:51.129 --> 09:53.764
He deserves some small measure
of happiness in return.

09:56.535 --> 09:58.335
As so many are owed.

10:01.173 --> 10:03.474
<i>Apologies.</i>

10:03.542 --> 10:04.909
I am in need of aid.

10:06.878 --> 10:08.179
You must bear down.

10:08.246 --> 10:10.614
As hard as you are able.

10:16.321 --> 10:17.422
Again.

10:17.489 --> 10:18.923
I cannot.

10:18.991 --> 10:20.258
<i>Calm yourself.</i>

10:20.326 --> 10:22.227
And do as instructed.

10:22.294 --> 10:23.895
The Bringer of Rain...

10:25.497 --> 10:28.599
If you wish to live,
bear down. Now.

10:38.076 --> 10:40.410
Blade. Quickly.

10:46.984 --> 10:48.885
You are blessed with a son.

10:52.123 --> 10:54.358
<i>Look at the cock on this one,</i>

10:54.426 --> 10:56.527
dangling as if from
Jupiter himself!

10:56.595 --> 10:59.296
I pray he uses it only
upon the willing.

10:59.364 --> 11:00.431
<i>He is fortunate to have</i>
<i>such skilled hands</i>

11:00.498 --> 11:03.333
to bring him into this world.

11:03.401 --> 11:04.935
<i>You have done this before?</i>

11:05.003 --> 11:08.706
Many times,
for those owned by my dominus.

11:08.773 --> 11:11.475
I wonder if I might
have known of him.

11:11.542 --> 11:14.178
What name did he carry?

11:14.245 --> 11:15.612
Pompo.

11:15.680 --> 11:17.714
A raiser of low animals
near Campania --

11:19.684 --> 11:21.819
She speaks of Pompo.

11:21.886 --> 11:24.655
Yet mark upon her arm tells
of a different master...

11:27.959 --> 11:29.693
You were slave
to Marcus Crassus himself?

11:29.760 --> 11:30.894
I was.

11:30.961 --> 11:33.396
Another spy,
sent to infiltrate rank.

11:33.464 --> 11:34.698
What manner of spy
pauses in deceit

11:34.765 --> 11:36.199
to give aid in child's birth?

11:36.267 --> 11:38.307
One sent by the man trying
to end our fucking lives!

11:38.336 --> 11:39.569
He did not send me.

11:39.637 --> 11:41.638
I fled his tent
upon the Melia Ridge.

11:41.706 --> 11:45.108
Why did you turn from him,
in favor of cold and storm?

11:46.544 --> 11:47.578
Break word.

11:47.645 --> 11:49.746
Or find yourself forever unable.

11:49.814 --> 11:51.715
The girl is fugitivus
as many among you,

11:51.782 --> 11:53.951
regardless of which
dominus she fled.

11:54.018 --> 11:56.087
<i>She deserves protection,</i>

11:57.022 --> 11:58.489
not veiled threats.

11:58.557 --> 12:00.692
I hide behind no veils.

12:00.759 --> 12:02.994
Nor shall any bearing
mark of my enemy.

12:05.331 --> 12:08.299
Crassus himself has
seen no harm to me.

12:08.367 --> 12:11.903
Yet name of honored son
inflicted grievous injury.

12:12.804 --> 12:15.239
And would have
continued to do so.

12:17.042 --> 12:19.777
My wife stood
equally mistreated,

12:21.680 --> 12:24.182
by those that called
themselves her masters.

12:29.488 --> 12:31.522
She's your responsibility.

12:32.458 --> 12:34.792
<i>See her provided for.</i>

12:34.860 --> 12:37.395
And know if her tale
falls from truth,

12:39.398 --> 12:41.332
then her life shall
swiftly follow.

12:41.400 --> 12:43.701
Gratitude.

12:53.278 --> 12:54.645
I hold concern in this.

12:54.713 --> 12:56.280
Laeta breaks truth
in the matter.

12:59.351 --> 13:02.353
We cannot turn from any
slave wishing freedom.

13:06.592 --> 13:09.560
Then let her be free to starve
with the rest of us.

13:15.700 --> 13:18.435
See all readied before
you take sleep.

13:18.502 --> 13:20.737
We follow second legion
at first light.

13:25.675 --> 13:27.309
I do not recall
commanding your presence.

13:27.377 --> 13:29.845
Recent events spur initiative.

13:29.912 --> 13:31.079
Fall from sight.

13:33.883 --> 13:36.385
I am of a concern.

13:36.453 --> 13:38.154
Towards your father.

13:49.733 --> 13:52.234
What are the lay
of your thoughts?

13:52.302 --> 13:53.736
Fitful.

13:55.439 --> 13:58.274
His manner since Melia Ridge
has been...

13:58.342 --> 13:59.542
unsettling.

13:59.609 --> 14:01.577
He but commands with firm hand.

14:01.645 --> 14:04.280
Clenched into fist
striking ally.

14:04.347 --> 14:06.315
Metellus spoke out of turn.

14:06.383 --> 14:09.118
He is a fool,
you will find no argument.

14:09.186 --> 14:12.254
Yet one that stands a fucking
Senator of the Republic.

14:12.321 --> 14:14.089
As does my father.

14:14.157 --> 14:17.960
Whose reply far outweighed
balance of insult.

14:19.496 --> 14:21.016
Especially for a man
who prides himself

14:21.030 --> 14:22.865
on appearance of control.

14:25.102 --> 14:27.236
We are at war, Tiberius.

14:27.304 --> 14:28.738
Against an enemy
that will exploit

14:28.806 --> 14:30.539
even the slightest weakness,

14:30.607 --> 14:32.942
and bring us all to our doom.

14:33.010 --> 14:36.413
Tread path of more direct route,
and arrive at point.

14:36.480 --> 14:40.350
Beloved son has regained
favor of his father.

14:40.418 --> 14:42.519
Measured counsel spilling
from your mouth

14:42.587 --> 14:45.255
may yet again fill
him with reason.

14:45.323 --> 14:47.558
And dispel troubled
thought of Kore escaping --

14:47.625 --> 14:50.094
The fucking cock
between your legs!

14:50.161 --> 14:51.695
That is why you
have come to me.

14:51.762 --> 14:53.042
To calm storm
of his wrath before

14:53.097 --> 14:54.531
you are swept away in downpour.

14:54.598 --> 14:55.732
You mistake intent --

14:55.800 --> 14:56.833
Were you not the one who defied

14:56.901 --> 14:59.269
command to spirit Kore
to Melia Ridge?

14:59.337 --> 15:01.705
Giving her opportunity
to betray him?

15:04.875 --> 15:07.610
She pleaded with
tears upon cheek,

15:08.846 --> 15:12.381
to break words with your father
about his fucking son.

15:12.449 --> 15:14.483
A simple ruse,

15:14.551 --> 15:16.652
one imagined to make
escape upon Melia Ridge

15:16.720 --> 15:17.953
to join the rebels.

15:18.021 --> 15:20.422
<i>Oh I believe there to be ruse.</i>

15:20.490 --> 15:23.458
Yet not one formed
by mind of loving slave.

15:27.631 --> 15:29.832
What did you do to her, boy,

15:29.899 --> 15:32.000
to make her flee?

15:35.772 --> 15:38.640
Did you force that
tiny cock inside her --

15:38.708 --> 15:40.976
You fucking overstep, Tribune!

15:41.044 --> 15:41.977
Many times each day.

15:42.045 --> 15:44.980
Yet in this,
we both know I do not.

15:46.483 --> 15:50.186
I will uncover the truth
of what you have done.

15:50.254 --> 15:53.055
And your father will
fall again to reason...

15:53.123 --> 15:56.859
when wounded heart
is balmed by knowledge that

15:56.927 --> 16:00.195
Kore is not the one
who has betrayed him.

16:22.586 --> 16:25.921
The child is born into
a life of piss and shit.

16:28.024 --> 16:30.059
He is free.

16:31.828 --> 16:33.495
As so many among us.

16:35.031 --> 16:37.633
As I stand now, because of you.

16:43.140 --> 16:45.742
I wish you blessed with
more than just a word.

16:47.578 --> 16:50.647
An endless bounty of food.

16:50.715 --> 16:54.184
And a proper home to keep
you warm on coldest night.

16:56.086 --> 17:00.023
Perhaps even a child
of our own upon a day...

17:02.293 --> 17:05.161
Yet I have not had the strength
to provide you with any of this.

17:09.134 --> 17:13.037
Your strength saw me
from the mines.

17:14.472 --> 17:18.476
Guided me from the shadows,
returning life to faded shell.

17:18.542 --> 17:21.612
A life stained
with blood and battle.

17:21.680 --> 17:24.214
My path has been chosen.

17:24.282 --> 17:25.784
Not by the fates.

17:25.851 --> 17:28.720
Not by the gods themselves.

17:28.788 --> 17:33.692
I choose to walk by your side,

17:33.760 --> 17:36.996
in this life
and the one that follows.

17:37.063 --> 17:40.232
Until we find ourselves
upon its shores...

17:40.300 --> 17:42.801
I desire only to send
more fucking Romans

17:42.869 --> 17:44.603
there before us.

17:47.040 --> 17:49.408
I do not deserve
a woman such as you.

17:51.044 --> 17:53.746
You are the only man
who truly does.

18:02.223 --> 18:03.856
Crixus.

18:05.792 --> 18:07.860
Gannicus and Lugo return.

18:07.928 --> 18:09.595
Spartacus would have words.

18:28.981 --> 18:30.581
They have laid eyes
upon a valley.

18:30.649 --> 18:32.550
Twenty or more villas
nestled within.

18:32.618 --> 18:35.119
Bounty of cattle
and goat grazing lands.

18:35.187 --> 18:36.421
Then let us fall upon them,

18:36.489 --> 18:38.723
<i>and see the blood</i>
<i>of beasts and Romans</i>

18:38.791 --> 18:40.424
<i>mingle beneath night's moon.</i>

18:40.492 --> 18:43.894
And upon dawn's break,
I would press north.

18:44.696 --> 18:46.430
Towards rise of the Alps.

18:47.932 --> 18:49.533
You would set up camp
upon the mountains?

18:49.601 --> 18:51.368
No.

18:51.436 --> 18:52.903
I would cross them.

18:52.971 --> 18:53.904
And upon other side,

18:53.971 --> 18:55.806
see our people to the winds.

18:58.409 --> 19:00.543
Has he at last gone
fucking mad?

19:00.611 --> 19:03.046
Crassus pursues a single army,
easily tracked.

19:03.114 --> 19:06.083
Thousands of slaves running free
beyond lands of the Republic...?

19:06.151 --> 19:08.352
Not even he has resource
enough to find so many

19:08.420 --> 19:11.222
scattered across foreign soil.

19:11.290 --> 19:13.225
All that we have done.

19:13.292 --> 19:14.760
All that has been lost.

19:14.828 --> 19:17.196
It will stand for nothing,
if we now turn and flee.

19:17.264 --> 19:20.032
If we stay, Crassus will
again be upon us and --

19:20.100 --> 19:21.567
Let them come.

19:21.635 --> 19:22.735
<i>We have bested them before.</i>

19:22.802 --> 19:23.802
And perhaps we may again.

19:23.870 --> 19:25.571
But at what cost?

19:25.639 --> 19:28.674
<i>How many more among</i>
<i>us will fall?</i>

19:28.742 --> 19:31.010
How many woman,
unable to raise arms?

19:31.078 --> 19:33.946
Or children, new to this world?

19:34.014 --> 19:35.848
I would have them free.

19:35.916 --> 19:38.117
Absent darkening shadow
of the Republic.

19:38.185 --> 19:39.618
Well, then let us
pierce its heart,

19:39.686 --> 19:43.589
and see shadow forever lifted.

19:43.657 --> 19:45.558
<i>Crassus' army pushes</i>
<i>from the south.</i>

19:45.625 --> 19:48.727
<i>If we were to turn west we</i>
<i>would be at the gates of Rome</i>

19:48.795 --> 19:51.597
before his legions could
turn to defend the city.

19:51.665 --> 19:52.765
You would strike
at Rome itself?

19:52.833 --> 19:54.767
And would see it tremble.

19:54.835 --> 19:56.569
As the man you once
were thundered

19:56.636 --> 19:58.971
when Batiatus fell.

20:01.875 --> 20:03.576
Leave us.

20:11.785 --> 20:14.053
You know that I hold
higher ground on this.

20:14.121 --> 20:17.123
How many Romans have
we seen to the afterlife?

20:17.191 --> 20:18.257
The Republic quakes

20:18.325 --> 20:21.360
at the name of Spartacus
and his army of slaves.

20:21.428 --> 20:23.462
We have but nipped
at the ankle of the beast.

20:23.530 --> 20:25.431
To bare teeth
at its throat, I...

20:29.202 --> 20:31.504
I now fear the reprisal.

20:33.073 --> 20:35.641
The Bringer of Rain?

20:35.709 --> 20:38.444
The Slayer of the Shadow
of Death? Afraid?

20:38.512 --> 20:39.645
Not for myself, no.

20:39.713 --> 20:42.281
But my concerns have grown
far beyond such.

20:44.484 --> 20:46.284
I grow tired of running.

20:46.352 --> 20:48.819
Then rest.

20:48.887 --> 20:50.054
With Naevia at your side.

20:50.122 --> 20:51.822
No, she does not want
to turn from cause.

20:51.890 --> 20:53.424
Nor I.

20:53.492 --> 20:57.061
Until Rome falls
beneath our feet.

20:57.129 --> 20:59.563
You would have us march
to our end.

20:59.631 --> 21:01.498
I would have us free.

21:04.202 --> 21:06.536
<i>Truly free.</i>

21:07.605 --> 21:09.072
Do you really believe
that Crassus will stop

21:09.140 --> 21:10.974
once you crest the mountains?

21:11.042 --> 21:14.143
That the Republic will
let us quietly slip away?

21:14.211 --> 21:16.445
<i>We have shown them vulnerable.</i>

21:16.513 --> 21:18.614
<i>We have shown them</i>
<i>that a trembling hand</i>

21:18.681 --> 21:21.049
can become a fist.

21:21.117 --> 21:22.951
We have challenged the idea

21:23.019 --> 21:25.187
that a slave must
always know his place,

21:25.255 --> 21:28.758
accepting rod and lash because
he was taught to accept it.

21:28.825 --> 21:30.660
We built their mighty Republic.

21:30.727 --> 21:35.297
With our hands
and our blood and our lives.

21:35.365 --> 21:38.868
<i>And we can see it fall,</i>
<i>at equal cost.</i>

21:40.838 --> 21:44.474
You opened my eyes to this,
Spartacus.

21:44.541 --> 21:47.710
Do not ask me now
to close them.

21:50.013 --> 21:51.614
It was simpler between us.

21:53.050 --> 21:55.218
When the bond stood
only as hate.

21:58.154 --> 22:00.389
Those days are sadly past.

22:02.226 --> 22:04.527
<i>With or without you,</i>

22:04.595 --> 22:06.729
I shall march upon Rome.

22:06.797 --> 22:10.033
With those who share
desire for vengeance.

22:10.101 --> 22:13.536
We have fought for the choice
to forge our own path.

22:16.908 --> 22:20.210
I will no longer stand
in the way of yours.

22:29.219 --> 22:30.987
At the break of dawn then.

22:33.923 --> 22:36.158
We shall at last part ways.

22:42.265 --> 22:43.766
Crixus.

22:49.506 --> 22:52.041
There is one final thing
I would ask of you.

23:59.040 --> 24:00.974
The valley is taken!

24:03.411 --> 24:05.412
Let us share
in the spoils of war!

24:05.480 --> 24:08.349
And hold feast for Crixus,

24:08.416 --> 24:11.719
and those who follow
the Undefeated Gaul!

24:16.024 --> 24:19.660
♪ Blood rains down
from an angry sky, ♪

24:19.728 --> 24:21.329
♪ my cock rages on! ♪

24:21.396 --> 24:23.097
♪ My cock rages on... ♪

24:23.165 --> 24:25.967
♪ Blood rains down

24:26.035 --> 24:27.602

24:27.670 --> 24:29.737
♪ My cock rages on ♪

24:29.805 --> 24:32.573

24:34.243 --> 24:35.977
♪ My cock rages on ♪

24:47.990 --> 24:49.624
It burns throat.

24:51.260 --> 24:53.194
As does all proper drink.

24:54.663 --> 24:56.296
Perhaps you should
hold with water

24:56.364 --> 24:58.966
and more purer thoughts.

24:59.034 --> 25:00.968
Or perhaps you
should get another.

25:01.036 --> 25:02.836
This one's gone empty...

25:06.675 --> 25:09.777
Recall when head pounds
upon morning

25:09.845 --> 25:12.213
but I but follow command.

25:24.428 --> 25:26.930
You are with little thing, now?

25:33.337 --> 25:35.004
Apologies.

25:35.072 --> 25:37.006
I did not wish to see
heart wounded.

25:37.074 --> 25:42.878
You will ruin little thing with
drink and ways of your kind.

25:42.946 --> 25:46.182
And you again will find my bed.

26:10.341 --> 26:11.709
You do not share in drink?

26:11.776 --> 26:13.377
I would have clear head.

26:13.445 --> 26:14.378
When sun breaks,

26:14.446 --> 26:16.180
and Crixus strikes for Rome.

26:18.851 --> 26:21.653
<i>I have often been</i>
<i>at cross purpose with the Gaul.</i>

26:21.721 --> 26:25.624
Yet his fucking
presence shall be missed.

26:25.692 --> 26:29.194
I shall not feel
the sting of it.

26:29.262 --> 26:31.564
You yet hate the man?

26:31.631 --> 26:33.900
I will not miss his presence...

26:40.408 --> 26:41.975
Because I shall not be from it.

26:43.444 --> 26:46.947
You turn from Spartacus
to march with Crixus?

26:47.015 --> 26:50.016
Spartacus stands as a brother.

26:50.084 --> 26:53.820
Yet in this we are not
of like mind.

26:56.357 --> 26:59.326
There is no life for me
beyond the Alps.

26:59.394 --> 27:01.761
I am no shepherd
nor tiller of land.

27:03.597 --> 27:05.932
Blood and battle are
all I have ever known.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.234
It is settled then.

27:08.302 --> 27:10.536
Tomorrow we move
for Rome with Crixus.

27:14.808 --> 27:17.476
To hear such words
lifts spirit.

27:20.380 --> 27:22.481
Yet I would have
you take with Spartacus.

27:24.117 --> 27:25.818
My place is forever with you.

27:27.788 --> 27:29.422
Not in this.

27:33.194 --> 27:34.428
You once swore
the gods themselves

27:34.496 --> 27:38.399
could not wrest me
from your arms.

27:38.467 --> 27:40.769
And now you fucking
cast me aside?

27:40.836 --> 27:44.506
My heart will never
beat for another.

27:44.573 --> 27:46.841
Yet it would seize
within chest,

27:46.909 --> 27:48.376
if I were to drag
you to your doom.

27:48.444 --> 27:51.612
I am a warrior.

27:51.680 --> 27:54.315
One I am most proud of.

27:57.086 --> 27:58.719
Set skills to aiding Spartacus,

27:58.787 --> 28:01.755
and see those less able
to true freedom.

28:03.825 --> 28:05.559
Do not ask me to turn from you.

28:05.627 --> 28:08.495
I ask only that you live.

28:11.566 --> 28:12.799
And wrest what joy

28:12.867 --> 28:15.435
that yet may be found
in the remaining days.

28:28.249 --> 28:31.118
Crixus.

28:31.186 --> 28:32.519
I would break words.

28:32.587 --> 28:34.087
They will fall
upon hardest stone,

28:34.155 --> 28:36.022
if they seek to alter mind.

28:36.090 --> 28:38.258
I would seek to share drink.

28:38.326 --> 28:39.926
With a man most worthy.

28:42.697 --> 28:44.264
A sentiment not always held.

28:44.332 --> 28:45.532
Nor always deserved.

28:45.600 --> 28:47.468
By either of us.

28:48.670 --> 28:51.272
I've been known to be contrary,
upon occasion.

28:51.340 --> 28:54.943
A talent among many
that I best you in.

28:55.011 --> 28:56.711
It is a wonder.

28:56.779 --> 28:59.848
We have not yet
killed each other.

28:59.916 --> 29:00.949
Would that we could
reverse the years,

29:01.017 --> 29:03.185
towards better footing.

29:03.253 --> 29:06.121
I would not see it different.

29:06.189 --> 29:08.256
We have done the impossible.

29:08.324 --> 29:11.059
Seen the House of Batiatus
to ruin.

29:11.127 --> 29:14.296
Laid waste to
the arena of Capua.

29:14.363 --> 29:18.166
Defeated Glaber and all of
the Roman hordes who followed.

29:18.234 --> 29:22.570
Restored heart torn from chest.

29:22.638 --> 29:25.673
If you and I had taken
to loving arms,

29:25.740 --> 29:28.542
fate may have led us
on a less glorious path.

29:32.380 --> 29:37.284
Batiatus once warned me that
a man must accept his fate --

29:37.352 --> 29:39.319
-- or will be destroyed by it.

29:42.523 --> 29:44.758
The fucking cunt
said that to everyone.

29:48.563 --> 29:52.466
I pray that yours
holds all you desire.

29:52.533 --> 29:55.602
And that one day we can greet
each other again in this life.

29:58.372 --> 30:00.439
<i>Roman blood!</i>

30:12.820 --> 30:16.789
Does it cause pain?

30:16.856 --> 30:19.258
All wounds heal upon a day.

30:19.326 --> 30:20.660
Though I fear injury
delivered to Metellus

30:20.727 --> 30:23.696
may never cease to fester.

30:23.764 --> 30:24.845
For all his remaining days,

30:24.865 --> 30:28.301
Metellus will fear
the name Marcus Crassus.

30:28.368 --> 30:33.706
Times those beneath us must
be struck severest blow.

30:33.773 --> 30:37.510
To truly grasp how
we tower above them.

30:37.577 --> 30:39.512
And to ensure they
never betray us.

30:39.579 --> 30:42.448
A lesson well
learned by Metellus.

30:42.516 --> 30:45.418
Perhaps if Kore had been
given similar instruction --

30:45.486 --> 30:47.153
Do not form sound of her name.

30:48.522 --> 30:51.124
Apologies.

30:51.192 --> 30:53.360
It tears heart to know
how deeply she wounded you.

30:56.363 --> 30:58.098
I gave all that I could.

30:59.600 --> 31:02.368
Treated her as if word
of slave held no meaning.

31:05.740 --> 31:09.976
Why would she risk all
to fly from loving arms?

31:12.681 --> 31:14.682
I hold myself to blame.

31:17.753 --> 31:20.355
What did your hands do
to cause such a thing?

31:22.358 --> 31:24.326
It is what they did not.

31:25.361 --> 31:27.028
I knew Caesar
to be untrustworthy.

31:27.096 --> 31:28.997
If I had laid closer
eye upon him,

31:29.065 --> 31:31.533
he would not have been able
to see her to the ridge...

31:31.600 --> 31:34.169
<i>and allowed</i>
<i>opportunity of escape.</i>

31:34.236 --> 31:35.537
Caesar is of wild mind.

31:35.604 --> 31:36.538
Yet I do not believe

31:36.605 --> 31:38.506
he knew her thoughts in this.

31:38.574 --> 31:40.642
And I believe that great
power is accompanied

31:40.710 --> 31:43.144
by many burdens, father.

31:43.212 --> 31:46.781
Knowing whom to trust
paramount among them.

31:46.849 --> 31:48.850
Wisdom well received.

32:00.297 --> 32:02.098
You are certain of this?

32:03.867 --> 32:07.203
I have for heavy span been
pulled in opposing direction.

32:07.271 --> 32:09.606
A thing I have noted.

32:09.673 --> 32:12.175
Gratitude for standing
by my words,

32:12.243 --> 32:16.012
even when you did not
believe in them.

32:16.080 --> 32:18.781
I believed in the man.

32:18.849 --> 32:20.483
And always shall.

32:23.220 --> 32:24.720
Agron.

32:27.157 --> 32:29.659
I hope you find what you seek.

32:29.727 --> 32:30.927
And you some measure of comfort,

32:30.995 --> 32:32.696
despite all that has happened.

32:34.699 --> 32:36.734
No one is more deserving
of it, brother.

32:44.175 --> 32:46.310
Where is Kore?

32:46.378 --> 32:48.879
Wrapped in arms
of relieved slumber.

32:48.947 --> 32:51.381
And filled with gratitude
that she yet draws breath.

32:51.449 --> 32:54.318
A kindness moved
by your tongue.

32:54.385 --> 32:55.519
One I did not expect
to make sound

32:55.586 --> 32:57.287
towards life of a slave.

32:57.355 --> 32:58.822
I mistreated none
within my house,

32:58.890 --> 33:00.023
when I was yet called domina.

33:00.091 --> 33:01.859
Yet you held them
as possessions.

33:01.926 --> 33:03.427
Things to be bought and traded.

33:03.494 --> 33:05.796
As I was by Crassus himself,
or have you forgotten --

33:05.863 --> 33:07.364
You have suffered
but briefest moment

33:07.431 --> 33:09.232
of that which so many
have only ever known.

33:09.299 --> 33:10.867
You desire to compare wounds?

33:10.934 --> 33:12.868
Let us weigh them,
and judge balance.

33:16.339 --> 33:17.840
Your wounds must
be all but healed.

33:17.907 --> 33:20.475
You return to difficult
woman of old.

33:20.543 --> 33:22.577
We cannot turn
from truest nature.

33:25.482 --> 33:27.416
No.

33:27.484 --> 33:29.152
We cannot.

33:30.654 --> 33:32.922
Rejoin celebration.

33:32.990 --> 33:33.856
Hard journey awaits
at dawn's break.

33:33.924 --> 33:36.860
I have had my fill of wine.

33:38.729 --> 33:40.831
And company less desired...

33:52.977 --> 33:55.212
You yet stand Roman.

33:55.280 --> 33:57.381
A thing I can never
hold to heart.

33:59.184 --> 34:02.019
It is not your heart
I'm after this night...

34:43.893 --> 34:46.295
It seems but yesterday you
stood as opened-mouthed Gaul,

34:46.362 --> 34:49.799
anxious to prove
yourself in the arena.

34:49.866 --> 34:53.002
Now thousands gladly follow you,

34:53.070 --> 34:55.739
lay assault upon Rome itself.

34:55.806 --> 34:58.909
I would hold it as a blessing
from Jupiter himself,

34:58.977 --> 35:01.245
if you would join with us.

35:03.982 --> 35:06.383
My journey leads
toward other path.

35:12.023 --> 35:13.724
There is no greater cause,

35:16.027 --> 35:17.961
to turn a man from battle.

35:32.209 --> 35:33.409
Do we stand ready?

35:33.477 --> 35:37.180
Upon your command,
we move for Rome.

35:37.248 --> 35:38.982
A decision I yet hold
in grievous doubt.

35:42.353 --> 35:45.021
Yet if I believed in the gods,

35:45.089 --> 35:47.591
I would split heavens
in prayer that I was mistaken.

35:47.658 --> 35:52.062
And I would give my all
to prove you yet the fool.

35:56.100 --> 35:57.634
Shoulder supplies!

35:57.701 --> 35:59.268
We move north for the mountains!

36:05.675 --> 36:06.975
<i>Spartacus...</i>

36:09.811 --> 36:12.914
When we were yet
of Batiatus' ludus,

36:12.982 --> 36:15.550
I spoke of how we may
have been as brothers,

36:15.617 --> 36:17.718
in another life.

36:17.786 --> 36:19.453
Yet not in this one.

36:21.857 --> 36:24.124
Know that I was wrong.

36:24.192 --> 36:26.093
And will always
hold you as such.

36:33.034 --> 36:34.635
As I will hold you.

36:57.459 --> 36:59.960
Spartacus divides his forces?

37:00.028 --> 37:02.463
The larger sum striking
north towards the mountains.

37:02.531 --> 37:04.198
Their numbers weighted
by women and children.

37:04.266 --> 37:05.199
<i>The remainder?</i>

37:05.267 --> 37:07.034
What course do they take?

37:07.102 --> 37:08.936
West.

37:11.774 --> 37:14.308
Towards Rome?

37:14.376 --> 37:15.610
What path would you
have us follow?

37:15.677 --> 37:17.278
There is but one.

37:17.346 --> 37:18.679
The city must be defended.

37:18.747 --> 37:20.782
<i>Others will give</i>
<i>resistance upon way.</i>

37:20.849 --> 37:23.451
And Arrius and his legion
hold position beyond its gates.

37:23.518 --> 37:26.388
A single legion will give
Spartacus briefest pause.

37:26.455 --> 37:27.789
Spartacus does not
command western forces,

37:27.857 --> 37:29.691
upon sighting of exodus.

37:29.758 --> 37:31.492
<i>His pet Gaul leads assault.</i>

37:31.560 --> 37:33.528
Crixus?

37:33.596 --> 37:34.562
A man of equal skill.

37:34.630 --> 37:35.830
And deadlier passion.

37:35.898 --> 37:37.265
Not the Bringer of Fucking Rain.

37:37.333 --> 37:38.733
We cannot leave Rome undefended.

37:38.801 --> 37:40.401
Arrius will slow
Crixus' advance,

37:40.469 --> 37:44.772
granting needed time to set upon
Spartacus and weakened numbers.

37:44.840 --> 37:46.774
We must press advantage.

37:46.841 --> 37:49.610
Follow advice of this child,
and Rome herself may fall.

37:49.678 --> 37:52.346
<i>And with her everything</i>
<i>we have fucking reached for.</i>

37:56.785 --> 37:58.019
I have had fill
of you questioning

37:58.086 --> 37:59.721
every word that falls
from my tongue.

37:59.788 --> 38:01.555
Then break them with
more fucking sense.

38:01.623 --> 38:03.491
We cannot turn from Rome.

38:03.558 --> 38:06.060
We shall turn in whatever
direction my father decides.

38:06.128 --> 38:07.995
Then aid him in proper choice.

38:08.063 --> 38:09.997
Not one you believe
he seeks to hear.

38:10.065 --> 38:11.933
I follow my own desires.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.068
As you did when you forced
yourself upon Kore,

38:16.438 --> 38:19.507
<i>the night your father</i>
<i>reclaimed Sinuessa?</i>

38:19.574 --> 38:23.077
I warned you that your deed
would fall to discovery.

38:24.813 --> 38:27.515
You would fabricate lies now,
to see me lessened --

38:27.583 --> 38:29.284
The game is over, boy.

38:31.087 --> 38:32.921
The whore Canthara tells
of how she saw you

38:32.989 --> 38:35.491
come from Kore's tent.

38:35.559 --> 38:38.327
<i>Of finding her roughly used.</i>

38:40.965 --> 38:42.866
She was made to promise
never to reveal

38:42.933 --> 38:46.469
what her eyes laid upon.

38:46.537 --> 38:50.006
But I can be very,
very persuasive.

38:55.479 --> 38:58.514
You risk all on
the tale of a woman

38:58.582 --> 39:01.284
who swallows cock for coin?

39:01.352 --> 39:02.919
I have made more
uncertain wagers,

39:02.987 --> 39:04.621
in years past.

39:06.090 --> 39:07.457
And yet here I stand.

39:07.524 --> 39:09.058
Then why have you not
yet told him?

39:09.126 --> 39:12.829
He has been pushed to brink
of madness by imagined betrayal.

39:12.896 --> 39:15.365
I would not see him forced
over precipice by truth

39:15.433 --> 39:17.401
of harsher realities.

39:23.008 --> 39:25.075
What would you have of me?

39:25.142 --> 39:27.744
What you have
already been asked.

39:27.811 --> 39:29.946
You have your father's ear.

39:30.014 --> 39:31.014
Bring him to reason,

39:31.082 --> 39:33.950
breaking words as
I command them --

39:38.589 --> 39:41.523
I do not take command from you!

39:41.591 --> 39:43.992
You should have
accepted offer, boy.

39:44.060 --> 39:46.562
Your father nearly saw you
to end in decimation.

39:46.629 --> 39:48.297
Perhaps he shall
see fate to completion

39:48.364 --> 39:51.200
when he hears what
you have done --

39:51.268 --> 39:52.801
Seize him!

39:54.370 --> 39:56.472
Get up!

40:02.346 --> 40:05.982
You shall never lay
hands upon me again.

40:06.050 --> 40:07.951
Nor whisper lies against me.

40:08.019 --> 40:10.721
You cannot take my life
and see my body

40:10.788 --> 40:13.557
from encampment absent notice.

40:13.625 --> 40:15.960
I am Julius Fucking Caesar --

40:16.028 --> 40:17.862
Hold him against table.

40:23.803 --> 40:26.304
You are of same
cloth as Metellus.

40:27.273 --> 40:30.475
And must be taught
severest lesson

40:30.542 --> 40:32.677
in who towers above you...

40:34.880 --> 40:38.449
Speak of what
you know to anyone...

40:38.517 --> 40:42.353
and I shall spin tale
of the mighty Caesar...

40:42.420 --> 40:44.188
taken like a woman...

41:28.434 --> 41:30.269
The day is ours.

41:30.336 --> 41:31.903
When is it fucking not?!

41:31.971 --> 41:33.972
Prepare to march.

41:34.040 --> 41:37.242
There is one battle
yet remaining.

41:54.361 --> 41:58.931
Rome at last lies
within our grasp!

42:03.169 --> 42:07.773
One last legion led
by the fool Arrius

42:08.808 --> 42:11.911
is all that stands between us...

42:11.978 --> 42:15.815
and a victory
that shall become legend!

42:19.920 --> 42:23.523
A lifetime ago when I yet
stood beneath the roof

42:23.590 --> 42:26.859
of the House of Batiatus...

42:26.927 --> 42:31.264
my doctore Oenomaus
demanded answer

42:31.332 --> 42:33.900
<i>from those recruits</i>
<i>who sought glory</i>

42:33.968 --> 42:37.237
upon the sands of the arena.

42:37.305 --> 42:40.840
"What lies beneath your feet?!"

42:44.845 --> 42:46.312
Sacred ground!

42:46.380 --> 42:48.647
Watered with tears of blood!

42:50.550 --> 42:52.685
And this day...

42:52.753 --> 42:55.788
it shall be Rome who sheds them!

43:02.663 --> 43:03.863
Shall we begin?!

43:06.300 --> 43:09.068
SHALL WE BEGIN?!

43:10.738 --> 43:13.240
SHALL WE BEGIN?!!!

43:27.022 --> 43:29.791
Bring fire forth.

43:29.859 --> 43:31.426
Halt!

43:49.879 --> 43:51.480
Shields!

43:51.548 --> 43:53.749
Raise your fucking shields!

44:53.878 --> 44:56.246
Rear position stands
absent threat.

44:56.313 --> 44:58.615
Pray it remains so.

44:58.683 --> 45:00.150
Our numbers stand
ill match absent Crixus

45:00.217 --> 45:02.285
and those who follow him,

45:02.353 --> 45:04.154
if Crassus were to set upon us.

45:35.119 --> 45:38.922
Arrius has fallen!

45:43.727 --> 45:46.229
You stand as a fucking god.

45:46.296 --> 45:48.297
With Rome trembling before you.

45:48.365 --> 45:51.500
As Spartacus once promised.

46:18.761 --> 46:20.394
Give report.

46:20.462 --> 46:23.598
The men stand ready, Imperator.

46:23.666 --> 46:25.533
Caesar.

46:25.600 --> 46:27.635
How have you come
to be so rudely handled?

46:29.304 --> 46:31.538
I found myself
in shameful altercation.

46:32.407 --> 46:34.241
<i>It shall not happen again.</i>

46:34.309 --> 46:37.177
And reason you
not astride horse?

46:37.245 --> 46:40.047
I gave command for him to lead
charge upon foot, Imperator.

46:41.316 --> 46:42.283
To rally the common men

46:42.350 --> 46:45.519
that hold him
in such high regard.

46:45.586 --> 46:47.354
Let us see this to proper end,

46:47.422 --> 46:49.956
and return to pursuit
of Spartacus.

46:50.024 --> 46:51.791
They will attempt
to overrun position!

46:51.859 --> 46:53.960
Let them think
they have succeeded,

46:54.028 --> 46:56.396
and fall upon them
from our flanks!

46:57.764 --> 46:59.965
You are the undefeated Gaul.

47:00.033 --> 47:03.301
Let us show them
how such name was earned.

47:03.369 --> 47:04.903
Sound horns!

47:08.174 --> 47:10.642
Bring spear and sword to bear!

47:10.709 --> 47:12.811
And fall upon them all.

47:15.648 --> 47:18.382
Send them to
the fucking afterlife!

47:52.785 --> 47:54.719
Father!

48:16.676 --> 48:20.879
Fall back and re-form
upon higher advantage!

48:25.185 --> 48:28.421
Drink my fucking piss,

48:28.489 --> 48:31.190
you Roman cunts --

48:38.199 --> 48:39.999
Caesar!

48:57.585 --> 48:59.219
Their eastern flank
has been broken!

49:02.090 --> 49:03.758
Advance!

49:14.937 --> 49:16.737
There are too many.

49:16.805 --> 49:20.040
If Crassus falls,
we may yet seize fucking day!

49:41.828 --> 49:43.996
Crixus!

49:57.444 --> 49:59.445
No!

50:11.458 --> 50:15.195
I would not have you so easily
leave from this world, Gaius.

50:15.263 --> 50:18.032
Crixus!

50:18.099 --> 50:19.834
Silence that fucking bitch.

50:24.440 --> 50:26.374
<i>Hold!</i>

50:31.914 --> 50:33.949
This is the Gaul that would
seek the fall of Rome?

50:34.016 --> 50:35.617
And his fucking woman.

50:38.221 --> 50:40.122
Defeated by my hand.

50:41.358 --> 50:43.126
Retrieve your sword.

50:43.193 --> 50:45.628
<i>It has been too long</i>
<i>from proper hands.</i>

51:00.578 --> 51:02.646
The man yet lives.

51:02.714 --> 51:04.148
<i>I shall see him crucified --</i>

51:04.215 --> 51:06.017
No.

51:06.084 --> 51:09.954
I would use opportunity
to send message to Spartacus.

51:10.021 --> 51:12.723
So that he may know
the depths of his failure.

51:16.561 --> 51:18.696
And what fate I shall
see him to as well.

51:30.309 --> 51:32.009
Take his head.

52:17.046 --> 52:27.198
