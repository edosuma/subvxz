WEBVTT

00:01.534 --> 00:04.935
LESLIE: This is very exciting.
We are at Saint Joseph's Medical Center

00:05.005 --> 00:08.600
because, today, Andy Dwyer
is getting his casts off.

00:08.675 --> 00:09.664
It is a great
day for Andy,

00:09.743 --> 00:11.904
and it's a wonderful day
for my subcommittee.

00:13.380 --> 00:15.075
Oh, my God.

00:15.148 --> 00:16.445
Your boobs are dead.

00:16.516 --> 00:18.245
Stop it.
No, they're not.

00:18.351 --> 00:19.375
(WHIRRING)

00:19.452 --> 00:20.544
DOCTOR: Yeah.

00:23.757 --> 00:25.349
Yay!

00:25.425 --> 00:27.416
TOM: Wow,
it's like a sweaty piñata.

00:27.494 --> 00:30.361
ANN: Hey, my iPod!
Oh, yeah! My pirate!

00:31.664 --> 00:34.758
Doctor, if I may,
could I keep that cast, please?

00:34.834 --> 00:38.133
It's a highly disgusting request,
but I don't see why not.

00:38.204 --> 00:41.537
Thank you.
This is a symbol of new beginnings,

00:41.608 --> 00:44.475
a symbol of hope,
and of our project.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.034
We will build this park!

00:46.112 --> 00:49.081
It is gonna feel so good
to walk again, finally.

00:49.149 --> 00:50.173
Easy!

00:50.250 --> 00:52.309
LESLIE: Oh, no!
Oh, my... Oh, no!

00:52.385 --> 00:53.852
Yeah, they might be
a little weak at first.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:14.407 --> 01:15.431
ANDY: Thank you, guys.

01:15.508 --> 01:16.907
TOM: Welcome back into the
world of walking, Andy.

01:16.976 --> 01:17.965
LESLIE: Yes.

01:18.044 --> 01:19.375
ANN: I just
wanted to say...

01:19.446 --> 01:21.710
Quiet, everyone!
Ann wants to say something.

01:21.781 --> 01:25.239
I wanted to thank you all
for being so supportive.

01:25.318 --> 01:26.580
When Andy
fell in the pit,

01:26.653 --> 01:29.918
I didn't expect anyone in
government to reach out to us.

01:29.989 --> 01:31.581
So, thanks.

01:31.658 --> 01:32.682
You're welcome.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.158
Hey, you're
welcome, Ann.

01:34.227 --> 01:36.252
Babe, when are you gonna
tell them about my show?

01:36.329 --> 01:37.853
Oh, yeah, sorry.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.660
Andy's band is
playing a show.

01:39.732 --> 01:40.960
And we want
you all to come.

01:41.034 --> 01:42.058
(GASPS)

01:42.135 --> 01:44.831
It's gonna be a party, so check your
suits at the door. It's gonna get crazy.

01:44.904 --> 01:48.738
Andy's band is really good,
and it's been driving him nuts that he can't play.

01:48.808 --> 01:52.608
He's been writing all these songs about
things that are physically near him.

01:52.679 --> 01:56.115
(SINGING) <i>Sandwich!</i>
<i>Are you turkey or ham?</i>

01:56.182 --> 01:57.444
ANN: Ham.

01:57.517 --> 01:58.506
(SIGHS)

01:59.018 --> 02:04.012
(SINGING) <i>Lamp! Wish you were a lamp
that would light up when you get touched</i>

02:04.090 --> 02:05.990
MARK: What kind of music
does your band play?

02:06.059 --> 02:07.924
You know,
I don't really like to define it,

02:07.994 --> 02:11.896
but it's like Matchbox
Twenty meets The Fray.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.865
So, rock.

02:13.933 --> 02:15.798
Well, again,
I don't really like to define it.

02:15.869 --> 02:16.927
I totally get
what you mean.

02:17.003 --> 02:18.834
So, I would love to come to this thing.
When is it?

02:18.905 --> 02:20.099
Tonight at 8:00.

02:20.173 --> 02:21.606
No! Tonight?
Yeah.

02:21.674 --> 02:23.608
I can't go.
Why not?

02:23.676 --> 02:25.769
My mom set up
this meeting.

02:25.845 --> 02:27.972
It's like a political
tête-à-tête with a local bigwig.

02:28.047 --> 02:30.572
Leslie, you're not
gonna go? Come on!

02:30.650 --> 02:34.780
Oh, you guys. You know how I love
mixing work into my personal life.

02:34.854 --> 02:36.253
This guy is important,

02:36.322 --> 02:39.780
and he has valuable information
that could help us build a park.

02:39.859 --> 02:41.417
(WHINES) But I wanna
go to the concert!

02:41.494 --> 02:43.724
Come on! Play hooky!
Blow off the meeting.

02:43.796 --> 02:45.263
Oh, I wanna go to
that concert so bad,

02:45.331 --> 02:46.696
but I have to go to the meeting.
I have to go.

02:46.766 --> 02:49.200
But I'll meet up with you guys
after the tête-à-tête, I promise.

02:49.569 --> 02:52.367
(KNOCKING AT DOOR) Hey,
Mark, congratulations.

02:52.438 --> 02:54.303
Oh. Thanks, Nate.
For what?

02:54.374 --> 02:58.242
You got that speed bump thing
taken care of. Finally. Nice work.

02:58.311 --> 03:01.246
Oh, yeah. Yay.

03:01.314 --> 03:04.078
There used to be this huge speed
bump in the center of town.

03:04.150 --> 03:05.174
It was insane.

03:05.251 --> 03:08.152
So, I decided I wanted
to do something about it,

03:08.221 --> 03:10.815
and I got it
lowered 2 inches.

03:11.191 --> 03:15.594
Apparently, what I can achieve in
government can literally be measured.

03:16.496 --> 03:17.690
Hey, Dr. Harris.

03:17.764 --> 03:19.925
Andy's playing
a show tonight,

03:19.999 --> 03:21.227
and we'd love it
if you came by.

03:21.301 --> 03:23.997
I think there's gonna be a good
turnout at Andy's show tonight.

03:24.070 --> 03:27.369
<i>He wrote this new song about what
happened to him called</i> The Pit.

03:27.440 --> 03:30.841
It's one of those rare songs
that rocks really hard,

03:30.910 --> 03:34.073
and also informs people about
a small public works project.

03:34.147 --> 03:35.614
So, Andy's doing well?

03:35.682 --> 03:39.140
Yeah, he's a little shaky still,
but that's to be expected.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.584
Well, not really.

03:40.653 --> 03:42.553
If he had his casts
removed two weeks ago,

03:42.622 --> 03:44.317
the muscles wouldn't
have atrophied so much.

03:44.390 --> 03:45.721
I'm sorry,
two weeks ago?

03:45.792 --> 03:47.521
That's when they were
scheduled to come off.

03:47.594 --> 03:50.222
But he told me that you
told him he should wait.

03:50.296 --> 03:52.628
No. He rescheduled.
Said it was personal,

03:52.699 --> 03:56.066
that he'd explain later,
but then he never explained.

03:56.502 --> 04:00.996
I have waited on him hand
and foot for two months.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.666
Well, I guess
that explains it.

04:02.742 --> 04:03.731
(LAUGHS)

04:05.245 --> 04:07.110
<i>AND Y: Hey, what's up,</i>
<i>people of Pawnee?</i>

04:07.180 --> 04:09.410
<i>(CROWD CHEERING)</i>
<i>All right! All right.</i>

04:09.482 --> 04:12.849
<i>Uh... In just a minute,</i>
<i>Scarecrow Boat is gonna rock it out.</i>

04:12.919 --> 04:15.513
<i>Please be patient while we</i>
<i>rock out the equipment setup.</i>

04:15.588 --> 04:18.022
<i>AND Y: The band has had a few</i>
<i>different names over the years.</i>

04:18.091 --> 04:20.059
We started, we were
Teddy Bear Suicide,

04:20.125 --> 04:22.822
but then we changed it
to Mouse Rat.

04:22.895 --> 04:24.863
Uh. Then we were
God Hates Figs,

04:24.931 --> 04:26.728
Department of
Homeland Obscurity,

04:26.799 --> 04:29.233
Flames for Flames,
Muscle Confusion,

04:29.302 --> 04:30.929
Nothing Rhymes with Orange,

04:31.004 --> 04:32.835
then Everything Rhymes
with Orange,

04:32.905 --> 04:34.839
Punch Face Champions,
Rad Wagon,

04:34.907 --> 04:36.670
Puppy Pendulum,
Possum Pendulum,

04:36.743 --> 04:38.540
Penis Pendulum,
Hand Rail Suicide,

04:38.611 --> 04:41.546
Angel Snack, Just the Tip,
Three Skin...

04:43.816 --> 04:45.784
Jet Black Pope,
we went back to Mouse Rat,

04:45.852 --> 04:47.683
and now we are
Scarecrow Boat.

04:48.621 --> 04:51.590
God, when I hear myself say Scarecrow
Boat out loud, I kind of hate it.

04:51.658 --> 04:54.889
Now, you know that we're gonna be
building a park on a residential lot,

04:54.961 --> 04:57.225
so, of course we're gonna have
to get the zoning codes approved

04:57.297 --> 04:59.595
and amended by
our city council.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.867
What kind of
movies do you like?

05:03.936 --> 05:05.028
Huh?

05:05.571 --> 05:10.031
Uh. Well, you know, documentaries,
political thrillers.

05:10.109 --> 05:12.577
I like all kinds of movies.

05:12.645 --> 05:13.771
Great.

05:13.846 --> 05:16.371
So, I brought some
pictures of the lot,

05:16.449 --> 05:18.815
and you can tell that the
houses are very close to it.

05:18.885 --> 05:20.819
How difficult is
re-zoning in your town?

05:20.887 --> 05:22.479
Could you go into detail
a little bit about that?

05:22.555 --> 05:23.920
Sure.
Great.

05:24.624 --> 05:26.649
It's refreshing to be with
someone who actually likes

05:26.726 --> 05:28.751
talking about
government issues.

05:28.828 --> 05:31.422
Most of the women
I go out with find it boring.

05:32.265 --> 05:34.028
Well, you know, you have
to have zoning codes,

05:34.100 --> 05:35.931
or else the whole
thing could be chaos.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.936
Your mother mentioned
that you don't date much.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.164
What?

05:40.506 --> 05:44.067
I've been focusing on my career.
Why do you ask?

05:44.143 --> 05:48.136
I haven't been dating much
either since my divorce.

05:48.448 --> 05:49.642
It hasn't been easy.

05:49.716 --> 05:52.412
And I'm coping,
but it was tough on the kids.

05:52.485 --> 05:54.077
Not my kids,
'cause they're grown-up,

05:54.153 --> 05:57.748
but it was tough
on their kids.

05:57.824 --> 06:00.850
Shouldn't bring up my
divorce on a first date.

06:03.162 --> 06:05.596
But I feel I can
tell you anything.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.664
Uh...

06:09.068 --> 06:11.195
I think it's
going quite well.

06:11.337 --> 06:14.033
And she looks like
a young Sandy Duncan.

06:16.142 --> 06:18.133
LESLIE: Hi, Mom.
He thinks we're on a date.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.337
Did you tell him
we were on a date?

06:19.412 --> 06:22.745
<i>MARLENE: Honey, if I told you it</i>
<i>was a date, you never would've gone.</i>

06:22.815 --> 06:24.043
<i>You're not</i>
<i>getting any younger.</i>

06:24.117 --> 06:26.608
Well, neither is he.
And he's 62 years old.

06:26.686 --> 06:29.154
<i>Oh. Just go back in there</i>
<i>and finish the dinner.</i>

06:29.222 --> 06:31.622
<i>You don't have to have sex</i>
<i>with him if you don't want to.</i>

06:31.691 --> 06:33.488
What? Are you crazy?

06:34.360 --> 06:35.349
Hi, how are you?

06:35.862 --> 06:37.056
Hey, Parks Department.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.757
Hey, Mark.

06:38.831 --> 06:43.427
This is Beth, my ex-wife
Tammy's better-Iooking sister.

06:43.503 --> 06:45.994
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.198
You guys are together?

06:47.273 --> 06:50.731
Yup. My ex-wife Tammy cheated on me.
Then we divorced.

06:50.810 --> 06:53.074
Then last week, I ran
into her sister Beth here.

06:53.146 --> 06:56.240
Turns out she hates Tammy, too,
so we've started dating.

06:56.315 --> 06:58.408
It's like a fairy tale.
Yeah, Tammy stinks.

06:58.484 --> 07:00.111
Brendanawicz!
Hey, Tom.

07:00.219 --> 07:01.584
Hey. I want you
to meet my wife.

07:01.654 --> 07:04.122
Hi. I'm Wendy Haverford.

07:04.190 --> 07:05.817
Hi. You're Tom's wife.

07:05.892 --> 07:07.553
(CHUCKLES) Don't
hold it against me.

07:07.627 --> 07:09.652
Look at how hot she is.
Isn't that crazy?

07:09.729 --> 07:10.753
And she's a surgeon.

07:10.830 --> 07:11.990
She makes
a ton of money!

07:12.064 --> 07:13.224
Bam!

07:13.299 --> 07:15.130
This is Derek.

07:15.201 --> 07:16.930
Cool. How long have
you guys been dating?

07:17.003 --> 07:18.436
We're just friends.

07:18.504 --> 07:20.438
He's like the gayest
person I've ever met.

07:20.506 --> 07:22.599
But I make out with him
when I'm drunk sometimes.

07:22.675 --> 07:24.802
You know, if you don't wanna talk to me,
you can just say so.

07:24.877 --> 07:25.969
I don't wanna
talk to you.

07:27.213 --> 07:31.013
Apparently, tonight, I'm the
Parks Department's seventh wheel.

07:31.784 --> 07:34.252
This is my oldest son.

07:34.887 --> 07:37.378
He's a very no-nonsense
person like yourself.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.654
And this is my youngest.
He's about your age.

07:40.726 --> 07:41.818
Terrific.

07:41.894 --> 07:43.725
So, did you give
any more thought to

07:43.796 --> 07:45.593
those zoning code
questions I asked you?

07:45.665 --> 07:48.862
Oh. Come on, enough business.
Let's have some fun!

07:51.037 --> 07:52.265
Try some of my chicken.

07:52.338 --> 07:53.532
Oh, no. That's okay.

07:53.606 --> 07:56.837
Just a taste.
Have a little taste of chicken!

07:56.909 --> 07:58.968
Just a bit!
Just a taste!

07:59.045 --> 08:00.478
Chicken, chicken, chicken!

08:02.014 --> 08:03.675
Mmm.
Delicious, right?

08:03.749 --> 08:05.046
Mmm-hmm.

08:05.117 --> 08:06.516
I really like
this restaurant.

08:06.586 --> 08:09.680
Yeah. It's a great place
for a business meeting.

08:15.294 --> 08:17.888
Andy. Andy.
We need to talk.

08:17.964 --> 08:19.898
Babe, hey. We're just
about to start.

08:19.966 --> 08:21.558
Could you grab me
a triple whiskey water?

08:21.634 --> 08:24.262
(SIGHS) You would
like that, wouldn't you?

08:24.337 --> 08:25.326
Yep.

08:25.404 --> 08:27.838
You have two perfectly good legs.
Get it yourself.

08:32.278 --> 08:34.006
<i>All right. Hey, guys!</i>
<i>Thanks for coming out.</i>

08:34.080 --> 08:35.445
<i>(CROWD CHEERING)</i>
<i>We're Scarecrow Boat.</i>

08:35.515 --> 08:37.779
<i>This first song is</i>
<i>called</i> Menace Ball.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.147
(WHISTLING)

08:39.217 --> 08:41.049
<i>Two, three, four...</i>

08:41.120 --> 08:43.782
(SINGING)
<i>I know you been changing</i>

08:44.590 --> 08:47.889
<i>But I been changing, too</i>

08:49.161 --> 08:51.857
<i>You say that</i>
<i>you've moved on...</i>

08:52.598 --> 08:53.587
Thank you.

08:57.069 --> 08:58.536
What kind of
movies do you like?

08:58.604 --> 08:59.969
You already
asked me that.

09:00.039 --> 09:02.200
Oh. Sorry.
Senior moment.

09:03.676 --> 09:05.769
(SIGHS) Hey,
am I keeping you from something?

09:05.845 --> 09:07.073
No, no.

09:08.247 --> 09:13.344
Yes. My friend Andy is playing in a band
tonight, and I kind of wanted to go.

09:13.452 --> 09:16.387
Well, if you want to go to
the rock show, I don't mind.

09:17.423 --> 09:18.981
Really? Are you sure?

09:19.058 --> 09:22.619
Sure! I haven't been to
a rock show in a long time.

09:22.695 --> 09:25.528
The last rock show I went

09:25.598 --> 09:27.532
Hmm.
You like the Everly Brothers?

09:27.600 --> 09:28.726
They're my
favorite rock group.

09:28.801 --> 09:29.893
They're so good.

09:29.969 --> 09:30.993
(LAUGHING)

09:31.070 --> 09:34.039
I am getting very
positive signals.

09:34.941 --> 09:38.172
(SINGING) <i>You and me together</i>

09:38.244 --> 09:41.805
<i>You and me forever</i>

09:46.485 --> 09:50.478

(CROWD CHEERING)

09:52.091 --> 09:53.080
(WHISTLING)

09:58.965 --> 10:01.195
All right, take five, guys.
I'm gonna go acoustic.

10:01.901 --> 10:07.862
<i>(CLEARS THRO AT) This next</i>
<i>song is dedicated to her,</i>

10:09.208 --> 10:11.176

<i>(SINGING)</i>

10:26.993 --> 10:28.085
<i>Ann</i>

10:40.973 --> 10:43.840
Hey, the band's really good.

10:43.909 --> 10:46.343
I liked that song
<i>Grapple Hound.</i>

10:46.412 --> 10:48.243
<i>Gossip Town?</i>
Right.

10:48.314 --> 10:51.943
My only criticism,
I hate the name of the band.

10:52.018 --> 10:54.782
Yeah, they should change
their name to Big, Lying Baby.

10:54.854 --> 10:56.116
Or Where's My Sandwich?

10:56.188 --> 10:59.214
Or Don't Forget To Bring
Home Beers After Work.

11:01.994 --> 11:04.462
Okay. Since you brought it up,
I'm just gonna say it.

11:05.865 --> 11:07.628
I don't get you and...

11:09.301 --> 11:10.825
I mean, it doesn't
make any sense to me.

11:10.903 --> 11:13.133
I mean, I like Andy a lot.

11:13.205 --> 11:16.470
But there's tons of guys
out there who have jobs

11:16.542 --> 11:18.908
and who respect you

11:18.978 --> 11:21.105
and think you're attractive.

11:21.614 --> 11:23.241
Really?
Oh, yeah.

11:23.315 --> 11:24.748
You mean guys like you...
No!

11:24.817 --> 11:26.216
(LAUGHING)
...for instance?

11:26.952 --> 11:28.544
No, no, no,
no, no, not me.

11:28.621 --> 11:30.179
Oh. Okay. Good, 'cause,
for a second there,

11:30.256 --> 11:32.315
I thought you were hitting on
me in front of my boyfriend.

11:32.391 --> 11:34.052
No! Not my style.

11:35.194 --> 11:38.129
Even though you did just call him a big,
lying baby.

11:38.931 --> 11:40.762
And I do find you attractive.

11:40.833 --> 11:42.357
So, you are hitting on me.

11:42.435 --> 11:44.562
No. I'm not.
I promise you.

11:47.773 --> 11:49.934
But if I were,
would you be interested?

11:50.009 --> 11:51.374
No.

11:52.144 --> 11:53.736
Okay.
Let me tell you why,

11:53.813 --> 11:54.871
because I'm in
a crappy mood,

11:54.947 --> 11:57.006
and I don't really appreciate
what's happening right here.

11:57.083 --> 12:00.382
Number one, you've never been in a
relationship that's lasted longer than a week.

12:00.453 --> 12:01.613
Number two, the girls...
That's fine. Just...

12:01.687 --> 12:02.915
...you do choose to
spend the week with...

12:02.988 --> 12:05.786
That's enough. That's enough.
Look, I was not trying to ask you out, I promise.

12:05.858 --> 12:07.621
Well, I'm glad
we avoided that.

Damn it. I missed it?

12:53.305 --> 12:54.932
Leslie!
Who's your friend?

12:55.007 --> 12:57.202
I'm George.
I'm Leslie's date.

12:57.643 --> 13:00.339
Yes. He's my date.
George Gernway.

13:00.412 --> 13:02.209
He's the City
Manager in Eagleton.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.272
Hi, George Gernway.
I'm Tom Haverford.

13:04.350 --> 13:07.285
This is my wife, Wendy.
She's my age.

13:07.353 --> 13:08.445
Hi.
Hello.

13:09.688 --> 13:11.815
<i>AND Y: I have no idea</i>
<i>why Ann is upset with me.</i>

13:11.891 --> 13:14.291
But I do know she's too nice to yell
at me in front of all these people.

13:14.360 --> 13:17.056
So, I am not
leaving this bar.

13:17.129 --> 13:19.597
So, I heard you went to Indiana State.
Yes.

13:19.665 --> 13:21.064
My buddy Todd went there.
Maybe you know him.

13:21.133 --> 13:22.293
What year did
you graduate?

13:22.368 --> 13:23.460
1968.

13:23.536 --> 13:27.028
Oh! Todd graduated in 2005,
so you probably missed him.

13:28.474 --> 13:29.634
How was your
date with Leslie?

13:29.708 --> 13:32.336
We change the band name,
and then we send the demo out.

13:32.444 --> 13:34.241
We're completely ready...
Andy, let's go.

13:34.313 --> 13:35.940
Honey, I'm just
debriefing with the band.

13:36.015 --> 13:37.607
It's just gonna
be just one second.

13:37.683 --> 13:38.741
LESLIE: Hey! Hi!

13:38.818 --> 13:42.549
Whoa! Leslie Knope! I'm so glad you
made it. You have to meet my band.

13:42.621 --> 13:43.952
Okay. Hi, band!
Hey. What's going on?

13:44.023 --> 13:46.355
Oh. I'm so sorry
that I missed your songs.

13:46.425 --> 13:48.586
Is there any way that you guys could
do like an encore or something?

13:48.661 --> 13:49.650
An encore. I like it.

13:49.728 --> 13:51.127
Guys, let's get our stuff
out of the boxes. Let's go.

13:51.197 --> 13:52.323
No, no, forget it.
No, we're going home.

13:52.398 --> 13:54.025
No, don't leave.
I just got here.

13:54.099 --> 13:55.726
Yeah, she's here
with her dad.

13:55.801 --> 13:57.632
It'd be kind of rude to not
do at least one more song.

13:57.703 --> 13:58.727
Andy.

13:59.972 --> 14:02.566
(SIGHS) Okay,
let's go. Let's go.

14:03.175 --> 14:05.040
Sorry, Leslie. We're gonna go.
I'll call you tomorrow.

14:05.110 --> 14:06.270
LESLIE: Okay.
This weekend, guys.

14:08.280 --> 14:12.307
Look. Dead or asleep?

14:13.085 --> 14:15.610
Dead or asleep?

14:17.289 --> 14:20.122
George. George!

14:22.428 --> 14:23.952
(LAUGHS) Oh.

14:24.029 --> 14:26.122
Look at me,
out like a light.

14:27.566 --> 14:29.397
I think I should
head home now.

14:29.468 --> 14:30.662
Okay.

14:32.571 --> 14:33.765
It was nice to meet you.
It was fun.

14:33.839 --> 14:36.933
I had a nice time.
Don't think I'll go out with her again.

14:37.009 --> 14:39.239
There was just no spark.

14:39.311 --> 14:40.938
How did Leslie
meet her boyfriend?

14:41.013 --> 14:43.072
She used to read him books
at the senior center.

14:43.148 --> 14:44.945
Wow. How old is he?

14:45.017 --> 14:48.248
He's six, but he has Benjamin
Button Disease. BETH: Whoa.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.584
Hey, who wants to
see me climb a tree?

14:51.190 --> 14:53.158
TOM: I do!
BETH: I do!

14:55.361 --> 14:56.953
MARK: Deputy Director Knope.

14:57.763 --> 14:59.526
Where do you
think you're going?

14:59.598 --> 15:01.793
Home. It's been
a really crappy night.

15:02.401 --> 15:04.198
Have a beer with me.

15:05.804 --> 15:08.568
I can't believe my mom tried to
set me up with an 80-year-old man.

15:08.641 --> 15:09.630
(LAUGHING)

15:10.843 --> 15:13.869
I went to dinner tonight
with somebody's grandpa.

15:13.946 --> 15:16.176
You know what?
That guy was too young for you.

15:16.248 --> 15:18.409
(LAUGHS) You should be dating
guys in their early hundreds.

15:18.484 --> 15:20.247
I'm telling you,
you should be dating men

15:20.319 --> 15:22.378
that Al Roker announces
their birthdays.

15:22.454 --> 15:24.149
(LAUGHING)

15:25.958 --> 15:27.823
Hey! Congratulations
are in order.

15:27.893 --> 15:30.521
I heard that you got that
speed bump thing through.

15:30.596 --> 15:31.893
Don't make fun of me.
I'm not.

15:31.964 --> 15:35.365
Oh, yeah. I made a bump into a smaller
bump. It's a great day for America.

15:35.434 --> 15:38.267
What are you talking about?
That thing was a pain in the butt.

15:38.337 --> 15:41.795
You fixed a problem.
That's what we're supposed to do.

15:44.643 --> 15:46.702
Mark and I are really
connecting tonight.

15:46.779 --> 15:50.579
Like we connected that night
when we made love five years ago.

15:51.216 --> 15:53.514
There's actually a lot of
similarities between those two nights.

15:53.585 --> 15:57.385
That time we were also at a bar.
And he was also pretty drunk.

16:01.560 --> 16:04.654
LESLIE: If you could put anything in
the park, what would you put in there?

16:04.730 --> 16:06.095
Okay...
Don't over-think it.

16:06.532 --> 16:10.400
Keep it simple, nice shady trees,
lots of grass, benches.

16:10.936 --> 16:13.461
A picnic table?
Sure. Water feature.

16:13.539 --> 16:15.769
Like, huge rocks
to be climbing on.

16:15.841 --> 16:17.832
A play area for the kids.
God, that sounds wonderful.

16:17.910 --> 16:20.037
I would live in that park.
But then you'd be homeless.

16:20.112 --> 16:22.103
(LAUGHS) BARTENDER: Hey,
we're closing up.

16:22.181 --> 16:23.205
Oh.

16:23.282 --> 16:24.510
What time is it?
I should go.

16:24.583 --> 16:26.551
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

16:26.618 --> 16:29.109
We're getting drinks to go.
Come on. Beers to go!

16:29.188 --> 16:31.554
(LAUGHING) Where are we going?
All the bars are closed.

16:31.690 --> 16:33.123
(LESLIE LAUGHING)

16:35.761 --> 16:38.355
You think I can get my beer bottle
in that shopping cart right there?

16:38.430 --> 16:41.126
What? Mark, don't.
This pit isn't a dump.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.792
Yes, it is.
Look around, Leslie.

16:42.868 --> 16:44.199
I mean, there's
crap everywhere.

16:44.269 --> 16:47.170
One beer bottle is not
gonna make any difference.

16:48.807 --> 16:50.240
(LESLIE LAUGHING)

16:50.809 --> 16:53.175
Damn it!
I was so close there!

16:53.245 --> 16:55.475
Yeah, so...
It was pretty close!

16:55.547 --> 16:58.072
So far to the left!
So far to the left!

16:58.150 --> 17:00.345
You think you can do any better?
No, please.

17:00.419 --> 17:02.580
I don't want anyone to see!
I'm the Deputy Director of Parks...

17:02.654 --> 17:04.815
You're the Deputy Director
of Parks and blah blah...

17:04.890 --> 17:06.482
You know, nobody's
gonna see it.

17:06.959 --> 17:08.756
Go on and chuck it.

17:11.296 --> 17:12.819
(BOTH LAUGHING)

17:15.200 --> 17:17.599
Unbelievable!
That's unbelievable!

17:17.836 --> 17:21.101
You missed the entire pit,
which is huge, by the way.

17:21.807 --> 17:23.069
I didn't do anything wrong.

17:23.142 --> 17:24.404
You didn't do anything wrong?
Mmm-mmm.

17:24.476 --> 17:26.740
I waited on you
hand and foot.

17:26.811 --> 17:27.836
And it was exhausting!

17:27.913 --> 17:30.882
I fed you meals, and you could've
had your casts off two weeks ago!

17:30.949 --> 17:33.281
That is not true.
It's not true?

17:33.385 --> 17:35.876
So you're calling
Dr. Harris a liar?

17:36.688 --> 17:38.383
Yes.
I'm gonna call Dr. Harris right now.

17:38.457 --> 17:39.446
How about that?
You call him!

17:39.525 --> 17:41.891
You get me on the phone with Dr. Harris.
Yes. Yes. I will.

17:41.960 --> 17:43.427
Don't call him right now!

17:43.495 --> 17:45.292
ANN: Why?
Because it's late.

17:45.364 --> 17:47.195
ANDY: Listen,
just put the phone down.

17:47.266 --> 17:50.099
Fine! You want the truth?

17:50.169 --> 17:51.261
Yes.

17:52.137 --> 17:54.833
Could I have gotten my
casts off two weeks ago?

17:54.907 --> 17:58.035
Technically, yes. But

17:59.378 --> 18:01.972
I really, really like it
when you serve me food.

18:02.047 --> 18:03.810
Get out.
Get out of my house.

18:03.882 --> 18:05.213
(GROANS) But what...

18:05.284 --> 18:07.844
Take a walk with your
overly-healed legs,

18:07.920 --> 18:10.684
and let me think
about this relationship.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.523
(DOOR OPENING)

18:16.628 --> 18:20.462
LESLIE: Okay, this pit.
Give it to me straight.

18:21.433 --> 18:23.060
Are we ever gonna
turn it into a park?

18:23.135 --> 18:25.399
(LAUGHS) Leslie,
this is already a park!

18:25.471 --> 18:29.373
Look, I mean, you got
Dirt Slide over here,

18:29.441 --> 18:31.636
you got Ring Around The
Diaper you could play there.

18:31.710 --> 18:32.904
(LESLIE LAUGHING)

18:32.978 --> 18:37.074
You've got Duck, Duck, Glass
you could play right there.

18:37.649 --> 18:39.310
Mystery Trash.

18:40.319 --> 18:43.117
What's not to love about this park,
right here, now?

18:43.188 --> 18:47.249
I wish we could turn it into
a pit, frankly, don't you?

18:50.362 --> 18:52.626
But, seriously,
I mean, really?

18:53.899 --> 18:57.733
Honestly, Leslie,
it's gonna be a long, uphill battle.

18:58.437 --> 18:59.836
You are gonna
be super annoyed

18:59.905 --> 19:01.270
with all the people
that want you to fail.

19:01.340 --> 19:05.674
There is a sea of red tape,
endless roadblocks.

19:07.746 --> 19:10.374
So, yeah, I don't know.
I don't know.

19:14.820 --> 19:17.118
Screw it. I'm gonna
try to do it anyway.

19:17.189 --> 19:18.178
(BOTH LAUGHING)

19:18.924 --> 19:20.323
LESLIE: I mean,
Kennedy put a man on the moon.

19:20.392 --> 19:21.416
MARK: He did.

19:21.493 --> 19:22.790
LESLIE: I can build one park.

19:23.328 --> 19:25.489
I really admire
your tenacity.

19:26.598 --> 19:28.156
I really admire you.

19:30.202 --> 19:31.191
(SIGHS)

19:52.491 --> 19:54.550
No, no.
Wait, what am I doing?

19:55.594 --> 19:58.392
(SIGHS) This isn't the way
I want this to happen again.

20:00.432 --> 20:02.764
Leslie, it's not
that big a deal.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.538
I think you should
go home, Mark.

20:10.576 --> 20:12.100
All right, okay.

20:13.011 --> 20:14.444
I'm sorry.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.870
I'm gonna get out of here.
Yeah.

20:16.949 --> 20:18.940
(CHUCKLING) I'm sorry.
It's okay, it's...

20:19.017 --> 20:20.211
No. Oh, my God!

20:20.285 --> 20:22.845
(EXCLAIMING) Oh, my God!

20:22.921 --> 20:25.321
LESLIE: Oh, my God!
Mark, are you all right?

20:25.390 --> 20:26.448
ANDY: Wow.

20:26.525 --> 20:29.358
(GROANS) Are you okay?
Oh, my God!

20:30.262 --> 20:31.627
MARK: Go get some help.
LESLIE: Help!

20:31.697 --> 20:32.925
MARK: Go get some help.
LESLIE: Help!

20:32.998 --> 20:33.987
MARK: Go get some help.
LESLIE: Help!

20:34.066 --> 20:37.194
(LAUGHING) Hey, babe!
Baby, open up!

20:37.803 --> 20:39.862
That guy Mark
just fell in the pit!

20:41.006 --> 20:42.598
What?
You know that guy Mark?

20:42.674 --> 20:44.471
Yeah.
He just fell in the pit!

20:44.543 --> 20:45.805
You gotta go check it out.
You're a nurse.

20:45.877 --> 20:47.435
I think he'd
probably be hurt.

20:50.349 --> 20:51.907
(LAUGHING) Seriously,
it's pretty bad!

20:51.984 --> 20:56.080
<i>(AND Y SINGING)</i>
<i>Pit! I fell in it, the pit</i>

20:56.755 --> 20:59.315
<i>You fell in it, the pit</i>

20:59.725 --> 21:04.890
<i>We all fell in it, the pit</i>

21:04.963 --> 21:09.195
<i>The pit!</i>
<i>I fell in it, the pit</i>
