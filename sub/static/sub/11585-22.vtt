THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:17.085 --> 00:19.153

IS IT BAD?

00:40.308 --> 00:41.742

00:41.775 --> 00:44.778

00:59.160 --> 01:00.594
CLOTHES ARE ALL SLASHED TO HELL.

01:00.628 --> 01:01.762

01:20.214 --> 01:22.416
32 YEARS OLD.

01:22.450 --> 01:23.451
>> SHE'S WEARING A WEDDING RING.

01:23.484 --> 01:24.652
PROBABLY NOT A ROBBERY.

01:24.685 --> 01:27.455
>> THAT IS SERIOUS OVERKILL
FOR AN UNARMED WOMAN, RIGHT?

01:27.488 --> 01:29.323
HEY, WHAT IF IT'S A WARNING?

01:29.357 --> 01:31.292
LIKE, SHE'S IN CAHOOTS
WITH THE MAFIA

01:31.325 --> 01:32.493
BUT DOUBLE CROSSED THEM,

01:32.526 --> 01:34.195
AND NOW
THEY'RE SENDING A MESSAGE.

01:34.228 --> 01:35.363
>> SOMEONE'S HEARING ZEBRAS.

01:35.396 --> 01:36.564
>> SORRY,
DID I MISS SOMETHING?

01:36.597 --> 01:38.732
>> DALE,
DID ANYBODY EVER TELL YOU

01:38.766 --> 01:40.534
THAT IF YOU HEAR HOOF BEATS
IN CENTRAL PARK,

01:40.568 --> 01:42.603
DON'T THINK ZEBRAS?

01:42.636 --> 01:45.373
>> WHAT, YOU THINK
THAT GUY KILLED HER?

01:45.406 --> 01:46.607
>> SHE MEANS THE ANSWER

01:46.640 --> 01:48.742
IS USUALLY
THE SIMPLEST EXPLANATION.

01:48.776 --> 01:49.910
THIS HERE, THE ODDS ARE

01:49.943 --> 01:51.379
IT'S A GARDEN VARIETY
STRANGER RAPE.

01:51.412 --> 01:53.247
SHE FOUGHT BACK,
PERP CUT HER UP.

01:53.281 --> 01:54.448
>> RIGHT. YEAH, YEAH.

01:54.482 --> 01:56.584
>> OH, LOOK AT THIS.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.919
"GUILTY." OF WHAT?

01:58.952 --> 02:02.156
>> YOUR GUESS
IS AS GOOD AS MINE.

02:02.190 --> 02:06.126
OH, MY GOD, IT'S A PACIFIER.
SHE HAD A BABY WITH HER.

02:09.863 --> 02:13.434
LIV! BY THE TUNNEL!

02:17.205 --> 02:20.474
>> THERE'S BLOOD ALL OVER IT.

02:20.508 --> 02:21.809
[baby cooing]

02:21.842 --> 02:24.278
>> IT'S ALIVE.

02:24.312 --> 02:25.613
>> AND INNOCENT.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.449
>> MAYBE WE ARE
LOOKING FOR A ZEBRA.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.402
>> WHO DID THIS?

03:21.435 --> 03:23.504
>> WE'RE HOPING
THAT YOU CAN TELL US.

03:23.537 --> 03:27.341
MR. NAUSS, WAS YOUR WIFE
HAVING TROUBLE WITH ANYONE?

03:27.375 --> 03:28.676
>> WE DON'T KNOW
A SOUL IN NEW YORK.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.311
WE JUST GOT HERE FRIDAY NIGHT.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.246
I WENT TO A TALK
ON HYDROPONICS.

03:32.280 --> 03:35.683
RACHEL TOOK EVAN TO CENTRAL PARK
TO TAKE PICTURES.

03:35.716 --> 03:38.319
>> WE DIDN'T FIND A CAMERA.

03:38.352 --> 03:41.322
>> I TOOK PICTURES OF THEM
ALL WEEKEND.

03:41.355 --> 03:43.691
I HAVEN'T DOWNLOADED THOSE YET.

PLEASE, I NEED THOSE PHOTOS.

03:45.893 --> 03:49.297
YOU GOTTA FIND MY CAMERA.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.331
>> CRAPPY LITTLE
POINT AND SHOOT.

03:50.364 --> 03:52.433
>> COSTS MORE IN OVERTIME
TO RECOVER THE THING

03:52.466 --> 03:53.501
THAN IT'S ACTUALLY WORTH.

03:53.534 --> 03:55.569
>> MR. NAUSS DOESN'T CARE
ABOUT THE CAMERA, DALE.

03:55.603 --> 03:56.437
HE CARES ABOUT WHAT'S IN IT.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.372
>> MEMORY CARD
GOT A LITTLE BANGED UP,

03:58.406 --> 04:00.541
BUT I'VE RECOVERED
MOST OF THE PHOTOS.

04:00.574 --> 04:01.675

>> ROLLERBLADERS CALLED 911

04:08.349 --> 04:09.917
>> NINE MINUTES AFTER
THAT PICTURE WAS TAKEN,

04:09.950 --> 04:11.452
RACHEL WAS BLEEDING
OUT IN THE BUSHES.

04:11.485 --> 04:13.854
>> MAN. IF ONLY BABIES
COULD TALK, RIGHT?

04:13.887 --> 04:16.590
>> I MAY HAVE SOMEONE WHO CAN.

04:16.624 --> 04:17.825
LOOK.
PEOPLE IN THE TREE-LINE.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.360
>> ORANGE VESTS.

04:19.393 --> 04:20.227
PARKS DEPARTMENT WORK CREW.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.830
>> THEY'RE NOT
DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES,

04:22.863 --> 04:24.732
JUST PUBLIC SERVICE GRUNTS.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.400
>> THEY'RE SKELLS.
ANY OF 'EM VIOLENT?

04:26.434 --> 04:29.303
>> NAH, JUST PETTY FARE-BEATS,

04:29.337 --> 04:30.571
PUBLIC INTOX.

04:30.604 --> 04:31.905
I HAD A DOZEN OF 'EM
THIS MORNING

04:31.939 --> 04:33.907
PICKING UP GARBAGE.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.344
PEOPLE HAVE NO RESPECT

04:36.377 --> 04:37.811
FOR OUR FRAGILE ECOSYSTEM.

04:37.845 --> 04:38.712
>> OR HUMAN LIFE.

04:38.746 --> 04:40.714
YOU NOTICE ANYBODY
ACTING SUSPICIOUSLY

04:40.748 --> 04:41.515
OVER IN THAT AREA?

04:41.549 --> 04:43.451
>> OH,
THERE WAS A DOG OFF LEASH

04:43.484 --> 04:45.085
DIGGING UP MY ASPIDISTRAS.

04:45.118 --> 04:48.622
WHITE BOXER.
I THINK HER NAME WAS MINNIE.

04:48.656 --> 04:51.625
>> HOW ABOUT ANY OFFENDERS
OF THE NON-CANINE VARIETY?

04:51.659 --> 04:53.594
>> SORRY.
DIDN'T NOTICE ANYONE.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.563
>> WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO TALK TO THOSE GUYS.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.498
>> UH,
THAT'S THE SECOND SHIFT.

04:57.531 --> 04:59.900
MORNING CREW
IS OVER AT THE BOATHOUSE,

04:59.933 --> 05:01.068
PAINTING THE RAILINGS.

05:01.101 --> 05:03.003
EXCEPT PETER HARRISON.

05:03.036 --> 05:04.004
HE LEFT EARLY.

05:04.037 --> 05:07.107
CUT HIS THUMB
ON A BROKEN BOTTLE IN THE IVY.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.108
>> HE WAS BLEEDING?

05:08.141 --> 05:09.142
>> LIKE A STUCK PIG.

05:09.176 --> 05:11.479
I TOLD HIM HE SHOULD HAVE
KEPT HIS GLOVES ON.

05:11.512 --> 05:12.413
>> PETER HARRISON,

05:12.446 --> 05:14.081
HE'S DOING 90 HOURS
OF COMMUNITY SERVICE

05:14.114 --> 05:15.082
FOR MENACING.

05:15.115 --> 05:16.083
PRETTY GOOD CONSIDERING

05:16.116 --> 05:18.386
HE TRIED TO PUSH A WOMAN
OFF A SUBWAY PLATFORM.

05:18.419 --> 05:20.354
>> WE'RE GONNA NEED HIS ADDRESS.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.592
[knock on door]

05:24.625 --> 05:26.394
>> POLICE. OPEN UP.

05:26.427 --> 05:29.663
>> DO YOU HAVE A WARRANT?

05:29.697 --> 05:30.598
>> MR. HARRISON,
YOU WERE INJURED

05:30.631 --> 05:32.833
PERFORMING COURT-ORDERED
COMMUNITY SERVICE.

05:32.866 --> 05:35.002
WE NEED TO ASSESS
YOUR LINE-OF-DUTY INJURY.

05:35.035 --> 05:37.805
[locks turning]

05:40.908 --> 05:42.743
>> I'M FINE. SEE?

05:42.776 --> 05:43.744
>> DUCT TAPE?

05:43.777 --> 05:44.612
>> I DIDN'T HAVE ANY BAND-AIDS.

05:44.645 --> 05:47.948
BUT OF COURSE
YOU KNOW THAT ALREADY.

05:47.981 --> 05:50.384
DON'T PRETEND LIKE YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN HERE BEFORE.

05:50.418 --> 05:51.719
>> WE'VE NEVER MET.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.487
>> BUT YOU'VE SEEN
THE SATELLITE SURVEILLANCE,

05:53.521 --> 05:54.622
LISTENED TO THE WIRE TAPS.

05:54.655 --> 05:55.923
I KNOW ALL THE NYPD's
DIRTY TRICKS.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.526
>> SO THEN YOU KNOW RULE 1063--

05:58.559 --> 06:01.595
ANY SUBJECT OF INTRUSIVE
POLICE MONITORING

06:01.629 --> 06:03.797
HAS THE RIGHT TO A BINDING
CEASE AND DESIST ORDER

06:03.831 --> 06:06.534
AGAINST THE DEPARTMENT
IF HE SO CHOOSES?

06:06.567 --> 06:08.569
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING
RIGHT NOW, SIR?

06:08.602 --> 06:09.837
INVOKING THAT RIGHT?

06:09.870 --> 06:11.872
BECAUSE IF YOU ARE, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO COME DOWN TO THE STATION

06:11.905 --> 06:13.807
AND SIGN FORM DD-5.

06:13.841 --> 06:16.977
>> ANYTHING
TO STOP THIS HARASSMENT.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.817
IS THAT THE FORM?
LET ME HAVE IT.

06:23.851 --> 06:25.753
>> WELL, WE HAVE TO FOLLOW
PROCEDURES HERE, PETER.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.888
>> NOW, YOU WERE ARRESTED
IN THE SUBWAY LAST OCTOBER

06:27.921 --> 06:30.023
FOR MENACING A WOMAN?

06:30.057 --> 06:31.459
>> AN OPERATIVE.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.193
>> RIGHT. AN OPERATIVE.
WHAT GAVE HER AWAY?

06:33.226 --> 06:34.194
>> HEADPHONES.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.096
I STOOD CLOSE TO HER,
BUT THERE WAS NO MUSIC.

06:36.129 --> 06:37.631
THEN I KNEW.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.767
>> WHY DID YOU TRY TO PUSH HER
OFF THE PLATFORM?

06:39.800 --> 06:41.469
>> SHE WAS TRYING TO PUSH ME.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.036
I HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO DEFEND MYSELF.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.105
>> TODAY IN THE PARK,

06:45.138 --> 06:48.008
DID THE WOMAN WITH THE BABY
THREATEN YOU?

06:48.041 --> 06:49.810
>> SHE WAS TAKING MY PICTURE.

06:49.843 --> 06:52.946
SHE WAS GONNA UPLOAD IT
INTO THE DATABASE AND GEOTAG ME.

06:52.980 --> 06:56.650
I CAN'T ALLOW MY LOCATION
TO BE COMPROMISED.

06:56.684 --> 06:59.820
THE BLACK HELICOPTERS,
THEY CAN LAND IN CENTRAL PARK.

06:59.853 --> 07:02.089
THAT IS PART OF THE U.N.'S
CONTROLLED AIRSPACE.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.024
>> OKAY,
SO THEN YOU GRABBED HER.

07:04.057 --> 07:06.059
>> I SEARCHED HER FOR A WIRE.

07:06.093 --> 07:09.797
THEY MAKE TRANSMITTERS
THAT LOOK LIKE BUTTONS.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.499
>> THAT'S WHY
YOU CUT HER CLOTHES OFF.

07:11.532 --> 07:15.803
>> I ORDERED HER
TO ABORT THE MISSION.

07:15.836 --> 07:18.906
>> AND NOW WE'LL ABORT
THIS INTERROGATION.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.208
WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU
ABOUT TALKING TO THE POLICE

07:21.241 --> 07:22.810
WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY, PETER?

07:22.843 --> 07:26.246
>> NO, I JUST
HAVE TO SIGN FORM DD-5.

07:26.279 --> 07:30.117
>> "BIG T's CHICKEN SHACK."

07:30.150 --> 07:32.119
>> YOU TRICKED ME?

07:32.152 --> 07:34.087
WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE, HUH?
WHO ARE YOU?

07:34.121 --> 07:36.189
>> MY CLIENT HAS NOTHING
FURTHER TO SAY.

07:36.223 --> 07:37.825
>> WE DON'T NEED HIM
TO SAY ANYTHING.

07:37.858 --> 07:38.959
WE'VE GOT A WARRANT.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.193
>> COME ON. WHAT EVIDENCE?

07:40.227 --> 07:42.863
THE GUY'S GOT ONE PLATE,
ONE CUP, ONE FORK.

07:42.896 --> 07:45.198
>> AND SOME PRETTY OUTRE TASTE
IN WEB SITES.

07:45.232 --> 07:46.767
>> PORN?

07:46.800 --> 07:47.801
>> FOR THE PARANOID.

07:47.835 --> 07:50.070
"SURVIVING GANG STALKING.

"ACOUSTIC ATTACK SHIELDING.

07:51.639 --> 07:53.240
JAMMING DIRECTED
ENERGY ASSAULTS."

07:53.273 --> 07:54.675
>> SO NO PORN.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.877
>> JUST A COUPLE GIGS
ON THE 9-11 TRUTHERS,

07:56.910 --> 07:59.680
THE BILDERBURG GROUP,
AND THE VATICAN SECRET ARCHIVES.

07:59.713 --> 08:00.914
>> WE GOT SOMETHING.

08:00.948 --> 08:04.084
FIVE SHIRTS, FIVE PANTS,
AND SIX PAIRS OF SHOES.

08:04.117 --> 08:06.219
>> THE SIXTH OUTFIT IS MISSING
'CAUSE THAT'S PROBABLY

08:06.253 --> 08:07.888
WHAT HE WAS WEARING
WHEN HE KILLED RACHEL.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.790
>> WELL,
WHY NOT DUMP THE SHOES?

08:09.823 --> 08:13.126
>> BECAUSE NOBODY
WOULD EVER LOOK INSIDE.

08:13.160 --> 08:17.665
>> AND NOBODY WOULD THINK
HE WORE STILETTOS.

08:17.698 --> 08:18.966
>> WARNER TESTED THE DNA.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.601
IT'S THE VICTIM'S BLOOD,
ALL RIGHT.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.002
>> BING, BANG--

08:22.035 --> 08:24.638
>> DON'T SAY IT. PLEASE.

08:24.672 --> 08:26.940
I ALSO FOUND CAST-OFF BLOOD
ON THE SHOE.

08:26.974 --> 08:28.642
>> BEAUTIFUL.
HARRISON'S TOAST.

08:28.676 --> 08:29.677
>> HARDLY.

08:29.710 --> 08:32.179
YOU INTERROGATED
A MENTALLY-ILL MAN

08:32.212 --> 08:33.714
INCOMPETENT TO WAIVE MIRANDA.

08:33.747 --> 08:35.883
>> YOU CAME DOWN HERE
TO SOAPBOX ME?

08:35.916 --> 08:37.818
>> I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE

08:37.851 --> 08:38.886
HE DIDN'T PLAY
AS FAST AND LOOSE

08:38.919 --> 08:40.921
WITH THE EVIDENCE AS YOU DID
WITH THE CONFESSION.

08:40.954 --> 08:41.922
>> WE DON'T PLAY.

08:41.955 --> 08:43.657
I'VE GOT RACHEL NAUSS' DNA

08:43.691 --> 08:45.859
ALL OVER YOUR CLIENT'S KNIFE.

08:45.893 --> 08:48.729
>> LET ME SEE THE PAPERWORK.

08:48.762 --> 08:49.830
>> DIMINISHED CAPACITY ARGUMENT

08:49.863 --> 08:51.799
CAN'T EXCLUDE BLOOD EVIDENCE.

08:55.769 --> 08:57.037
>> BUT CONTAMINATION WILL.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.640
>> OUR PROTOCOLS PREVENT
ANY CONTAMINATION

08:59.673 --> 09:00.708
OF EVIDENCE IN THE LAB.

09:00.741 --> 09:01.875
>> WHAT ABOUT THE CRIME SCENE?

09:01.909 --> 09:03.877
EVIDENCE FROM THE MURDER

09:03.911 --> 09:05.846
AND FROM MY CLIENT'S APARTMENT

09:05.879 --> 09:08.015
ARE BOTH LISTED
UNDER THE SAME VOUCHER NUMBER.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.751
THAT'S A BIG NO-NO.

09:16.857 --> 09:17.791
>> STUCKEY.

09:17.825 --> 09:19.927
>> LOOKS LIKE
HE COMMINGLED THE EVIDENCE,

09:19.960 --> 09:21.729
MEANING THE DNA ON THE KNIFE

09:21.762 --> 09:23.230
COULD HAVE COME FROM
CROSS-CONTAMINATION,

09:23.263 --> 09:27.968
WHICH MEANS MY CLIENT
WALTZES RIGHT OUT THE DOOR.

09:28.001 --> 09:30.904
SLEEP TIGHT, GENTLEMEN.

09:30.938 --> 09:31.905
>> I'M GONNA KILL HIM.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.140
>> I'LL DUMP THE BODY.

09:33.173 --> 09:34.742
>> BEFORE WE ADD MORE
TOXIC WASTE

09:34.775 --> 09:36.076
TO THE GOWANUS CANAL,

09:36.109 --> 09:38.746
I'M GONNA TRY
AND SAVE THIS CASE.

09:38.779 --> 09:39.747
[knock]

09:39.780 --> 09:42.883
>> DO YOU KNOW
WHAT TIME IT IS?

09:42.916 --> 09:43.884
ELLIOT.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.385
>> MY APOLOGIES, JUDGE DONNELLY.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.920
UH,
THIS IS NOT A SOCIAL CALL.

09:46.954 --> 09:49.256
>> WELL THEN,
THIS IS HIGHLY IMPROPER.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.692
AND A PITY.

09:51.725 --> 09:52.926
>> THERE'S A CASE.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.294
>> A HYPOTHETICAL CASE.

09:54.327 --> 09:55.228
>> WHERE THE DEFENSE

09:55.262 --> 09:58.098
IS GOING TO TWIST
AN ERROR IN PAPERWORK

09:58.131 --> 10:00.200
TO SUGGEST DNA CONTAMINATION
AT THE LAB.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.870
>> AND YOU WANNA KNOW
IF I'D FALL FOR IT.

10:02.903 --> 10:05.405
>> HYPOTHETICALLY.

10:05.438 --> 10:08.876
>> YOUR PROBLEM'S
MUCH BIGGER THAN YOU THINK.

10:08.909 --> 10:11.078
YOUR SQUAD'S WORK
RELIES ON DNA.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.080
>> ALONG WITH HALF
THE FELONY CASES IN THE CITY.

10:13.113 --> 10:16.416
>> SO A CREDIBLE ARGUMENT
THAT THE RESULTS ARE UNRELIABLE,

10:16.449 --> 10:19.987
BACKED UP BY THE NYPD's
OWN SHODDY PAPERWORK

10:20.020 --> 10:21.855
WOULD BE DISASTROUS.

10:21.889 --> 10:23.657
>> OVERTURN CONVICTIONS.

10:23.691 --> 10:25.693
>> HUNDREDS OF THEM.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.795
HYPOTHETICALLY.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.863
TALK TO CABOT
BEFORE YOU GO ANY FURTHER.

10:29.897 --> 10:32.032
ASK YOURSELVES
IF GETTING THIS PERP

10:32.065 --> 10:35.035
IS WORTH SETTING A LOT
OF GUILTY ONES FREE.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.844
>> I DIDN'T--I DIDN'T
CONTAMINATE THE EVIDENCE.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.145
>> BUT YOU MADE
A BONEHEAD MISTAKE

10:45.178 --> 10:46.814
THAT LETS THE DEFENSE
ARGUE THAT YOU DID.

10:46.847 --> 10:47.881
>> BUT I DIDN'T!

10:47.915 --> 10:48.882
>> SIMMER DOWN, PEOPLE.

10:48.916 --> 10:49.883
CALL THE NEXT CASE.

10:49.917 --> 10:52.385
>> DOCKET ENDING 1270,

10:52.419 --> 10:55.188
PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
VERSUS PETER HARRISON.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.424
ONE COUNT MURDER
IN THE SECOND DEGREE.

10:57.457 --> 11:00.027
>> JULIA ZIMMER
FOR THE DEFENDANT.

11:00.060 --> 11:02.262
>> A.D.A. KRISTEN TORRES
FOR THE PEOPLE.

11:02.295 --> 11:03.797
>> WHERE'S A.D.A. CABOT?

11:03.831 --> 11:05.432
>> STUCK IN TRAFFIC.

11:05.465 --> 11:06.433
>> MORE LIKE SHE DIDN'T
WANT TO BE ROPED

11:06.466 --> 11:08.368
INTO THIS CAREER-ENDER.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.904
THE DEFENSE MOVES
TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT

11:10.938 --> 11:12.005
AS FACIALLY INSUFFICIENT.

11:12.039 --> 11:14.808
THE ONLY CONNECTION BETWEEN
MY CLIENT AND THE MURDER

11:14.842 --> 11:18.078
IS A DNA RESULT BASED
ON CONTAMINATED EVIDENCE.

11:18.111 --> 11:19.346
>> PEOPLE HAVE ANY OBJECTION?

11:19.379 --> 11:20.347
>> NO, YOUR HONOR.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.015
A.D.A. CABOT JUST INSTRUCTED ME
TO ASK FOR LEAVE

11:22.049 --> 11:24.918
TO REPRESENT WHEN WE DEVELOP
NEW EVIDENCE.

11:24.952 --> 11:27.755
>> FINE. CASE IS DISMISSED
WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

11:27.788 --> 11:28.822
>> YOU CAN'T DISMISS.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.724
HE'S GUILTY, YOUR HONOR.

11:30.758 --> 11:32.059
>> YOU MUST BE DALE STUCKEY.

11:32.092 --> 11:34.895
>> I'M GOOD AT MY JOB, OKAY?
AND I'M--

11:34.928 --> 11:36.096
>> MR. STUCKEY,
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER

11:36.129 --> 11:37.965
AND SERIOUSLY DELUDED.

11:37.998 --> 11:40.033
IF THIS IS YOUR IDEA
OF DOING A GOOD JOB,

11:40.067 --> 11:41.769
YOU'RE IN THE WRONG
LINE OF WORK.

11:41.802 --> 11:42.803
>> NO, YOU DON'T KNOW ME.
I'M--

11:42.836 --> 11:43.804
>> I DON'T CARE TO.

11:43.837 --> 11:46.039
SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP.

11:46.073 --> 11:48.909
MR. HARRISON,
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

11:48.942 --> 11:51.945
>> JUDGE,
YOU'RE A LONE BEACON OF HOPE

11:51.979 --> 11:53.847
IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST
GLOBAL MIND CONTROL.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.916
>> SAVE IT.

11:55.949 --> 11:59.486
YOU'RE A MURDERER
WALKING ON A TECHNICALITY,

11:59.519 --> 12:00.854
AND IF IT WERE UP TO ME,

12:00.888 --> 12:02.322
YOU'D BE IN THE NUTHOUSE
WHERE YOU BELONG.

12:02.355 --> 12:05.358
>> YOU'RE THE NUT
FOR LETTING HIM GO.

12:06.293 --> 12:09.362
>> IS EVERYONE CRAZY TODAY?
FIVE MINUTE RECESS.

12:09.396 --> 12:10.363
[pounds gavel]

12:10.397 --> 12:12.399
PEOPLE, TAKE YOUR MEDS.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.036
>> THANKS, DALE.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.872
COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
WITHOUT YOU.

12:18.906 --> 12:22.109
>> HEY, WE'LL BE WATCHING YOU.

12:22.142 --> 12:24.144
>> WHO ISN'T?

12:35.889 --> 12:36.957
>> DETECTIVES.
DETECTIVES!

12:36.990 --> 12:38.058
>> NO TIME, STUCKEY.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.059
>> HOLD UP, PLEASE.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.127
LOOK, I DID EVERYTHING RIGHT.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.262
>> WHAT YOU DID WAS BOTCH
AN OPEN AND SHUT CASE,

12:42.295 --> 12:45.098
AND NOW THAT IS WALKING
OUT OF HERE A FREE MAN.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.935
>> LOOK, I DIDN'T--
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.402
>> EVERYTHING WITH YOU
IS "I, I, ME, ME."

12:49.436 --> 12:50.403
YOU'RE SELFISH.

12:50.437 --> 12:51.972
I'M GONNA DO EVERYTHING I CAN

12:52.005 --> 12:53.974
TO GET YOU RUN OUT OF CSU
AND SENT TO THE MOTOR POOL

12:54.007 --> 12:57.144
WHERE THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO
IS SCREW UP AN OIL CHANGE.

12:57.177 --> 12:59.112
>> LOOK, I KNOW I'M NOT
SUPPOSED TO SAY "I," OKAY?

12:59.146 --> 13:00.447
I DIDN'T MEAN
FOR THIS TO HAPPEN.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.082
>> DALE, EVERYONE SCREWS UP,

13:02.115 --> 13:03.917
SO WE FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO FIX IT, OKAY?

13:03.951 --> 13:07.988
>> HOW? HE'S WALKING AWAY.

13:08.021 --> 13:09.990
>> HARRISON HAS A SHADOW.

13:10.023 --> 13:13.026
TWO OF THEM IN FACT.

13:35.615 --> 13:36.950
>> OH, THIS IS GREAT.

13:36.984 --> 13:37.918
THE FREAK WANTS TO DISAPPEAR.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.920
HE PICKED A PERFECT PLACE.

13:50.563 --> 13:52.866
>> GET A SODA.

13:58.972 --> 14:01.909
[crowd cheering]

14:16.556 --> 14:20.127
[laughter]

14:20.160 --> 14:22.262
[man screams]

14:22.295 --> 14:25.966
[high-pitched scream]

14:25.999 --> 14:29.903
[ghoulish laughter]

14:29.937 --> 14:31.504
[maniacal laughter]

14:31.538 --> 14:33.506
[woman laughs]

14:33.540 --> 14:37.110
[echoing laughter]

14:37.144 --> 14:40.180
[screaming]

14:51.291 --> 14:54.527
>> NYPD! MOVE! OUT OF THE WAY!
OUT OF THE WAY!

15:07.440 --> 15:09.009
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY LOST HIM.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.143
>> IT'S BEEN AN HOUR.

15:10.177 --> 15:12.012
HALF OF BROOKLYN SOUTH'S
LOOKING FOR HIM.

15:12.045 --> 15:12.679
THEY'RE GONNA FIND HIM.

15:12.712 --> 15:14.147
>> THAT MAY NOT BE EASY.

15:14.181 --> 15:15.983
HARRISON'S GOT A LOT OF PRACTICE
SHAKING TAILS.

15:16.016 --> 15:16.984
>> YEAH, IMAGINARY ONES.

15:17.017 --> 15:18.085
>> THEY'RE REAL TO HARRISON.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.686
HE'S A PARANOID.

15:19.719 --> 15:21.521
HE BELIEVES THAT ALL EYES
ARE ALWAYS ON HIM,

15:21.554 --> 15:24.191
SO HE'LL DO WHATEVER HE CAN
TO ESCAPE PERSECUTION.

15:24.224 --> 15:26.393
>> EVEN MURDERING AN INNOCENT
MOTHER LIKE RACHEL NAUSS.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.128
>> THE TRAGEDY
OF PERSECUTORY DELUSIONS

15:28.161 --> 15:30.397
IS THAT THEY'RE RARELY LIMITED
TO THE LIFE OF THE SUFFERER.

15:30.430 --> 15:31.564
>> RIGHT.
ALL THE MORE REASON

15:31.598 --> 15:32.632
TO FIND HIM
BEFORE HE FLIPS OUT AGAIN.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.968
>> WELL, TAILING THIS NUT JOB
IS NOT THE ANSWER.

15:35.002 --> 15:36.469
WE CAN'T KEEP TABS ON HIM 24-7,

15:36.503 --> 15:38.005
EVEN IF HE THINKS WE CAN.

15:38.038 --> 15:40.573
>> WE COULD PICK HIM UP
ON A MENTAL HYGIENE WARRANT

15:40.607 --> 15:43.043
IF WE FIND A JUDGE
SYMPATHETIC ENOUGH TO ISSUE ONE.

15:43.076 --> 15:44.644
>> I KNOW A FEW.
WE CAN CIVILLY COMMIT HIM.

15:44.677 --> 15:45.645
>> IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT.

15:45.678 --> 15:46.446
>> MUNCH AND FIN FIND HIM?

15:46.479 --> 15:49.983
>> NO, THEY FOUND
ANOTHER VICTIM.

15:50.017 --> 15:53.120
>> ANNIE MAY LAWSON,
AGE 29.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.455
>> CLOTHES SLASHED AND KNIFED
TO DEATH,

15:55.488 --> 15:57.557
PETER HARRISON'S EXACT M.O.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.126
>> HOW THE HELL
DID YOU LOSE HIM?

15:59.159 --> 16:00.527
>> WELL, IN CASE
YOU DIDN'T NOTICE,

16:00.560 --> 16:02.362
THERE'S A COUPLE
THOUSAND PEOPLE AROUND HERE.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.497
>> NOW ANOTHER ONE'S DEAD,
THANKS TO THIS PSYCHO.

16:04.531 --> 16:06.766
>> CONEY ISLAND ISN'T EXACTLY
A CRIME-FREE ZONE.

16:06.799 --> 16:07.767
MAYBE THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.302
>> WHAT, THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE

16:09.336 --> 16:11.538
LABELING PEOPLE "GUILTY"
AND CUTTING 'EM UP? COME ON.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.206
>> WELL, THIS OUGHT TO DO IT.

16:13.240 --> 16:17.444
NICE, BIG,
BLOODY THUMB PRINT.

16:17.477 --> 16:18.445
[computer beeps]

16:18.478 --> 16:19.446
HARRISON'S YOUR MAN.

16:19.479 --> 16:20.647
BING, BANG, BOOM.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.615
>> NOW ALL WE GOTTA DO
IS FIND HIM.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.184
>> PATROL SAYS
HE DIDN'T GO HOME.

16:24.217 --> 16:25.785
>> HE EVER SPEAK ABOUT
FRIENDS OR FAMILY?

16:25.818 --> 16:27.754
>> OH, THOSE ARE WORDS
THIS GUY DOESN'T UNDERSTAND.

16:27.787 --> 16:29.622
TO HARRISON,
EVERYBODY ELSE IS THE ENEMY.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.091
>> EXCEPT ONLINE.

16:31.124 --> 16:32.192
WHEN WE SEARCHED HIS PLACE,

16:32.225 --> 16:34.361
WE FOUND HIS COMPUTER
LOGGED ON TO THIS WEB SITE.

16:34.394 --> 16:35.728
>> "PERSECUTE-U.COM,

16:35.762 --> 16:38.765
THE ONLINE UNIVERSITY
THAT HELPS YOU FIGHT BACK."

16:38.798 --> 16:40.233
>> OUR GUY GOT OUT OF JAIL,

16:40.267 --> 16:41.234
OFFED HIS SECOND VICTIM,

16:41.268 --> 16:43.370
WENT ONLINE, AND BRAGGED
TO HIS FRIENDS ABOUT IT.

16:43.403 --> 16:46.339
"HOW I FINALLY STOPPED
NYPD HARASSMENT."

16:46.373 --> 16:49.809
>> HE TELLS HOW HE NEUTRALIZED
THE OPERATIVE IN CENTRAL PARK.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.212
DEFEATED
OUR NYPD MIND CONTROL.

16:52.245 --> 16:54.347
>> THE REST OF THE WINGDINGS
ARE EGGING HIM ON.

16:54.381 --> 16:56.416
"HANG TOUGH, MAN.
FIGHT THE POWER."

16:56.449 --> 16:58.151
>> BUT HOW COULD HARRISON
POST ALL THIS

16:58.185 --> 16:59.119
WHEN HE'S ON THE RUN?

16:59.152 --> 17:00.787
>> WELL, HE WAS ON HIS PHONE
AT CONEY ISLAND.

17:00.820 --> 17:01.821
WE THOUGHT HE WAS TEXTING.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.490
>> HERE'S HIS LAST MESSAGE

17:03.523 --> 17:05.158
THAT HE POSTED
BEFORE HE LOST YOU

17:05.192 --> 17:06.659
AND KILLED ANNIE MAY LAWSON.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.328
"KEEP THE FAITH.
GOING OFF GRID."

17:08.361 --> 17:09.129
>> YEAH, BUT THEN HE PULLED

17:09.162 --> 17:10.730
THE SIM CARD
FROM HIS CELL PHONE,

17:10.763 --> 17:11.731
SO HE'S UNTRACKABLE.

17:11.764 --> 17:12.832
>> HOLD ON.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.368
UNLESS ANOTHER BOARD MEMBER
KNOWS WHERE HE IS. LOOK.

17:15.402 --> 17:17.637
SOMEBODY NAMED "GWENDOLYN
OF THE SHADOWS" WROTE,

17:17.670 --> 17:18.638
"GOOD LUCK, P.H.

17:18.671 --> 17:19.639
"IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,

17:19.672 --> 17:21.374
YOU KNOW WHERE TO CONTACT ME."

17:21.408 --> 17:22.375
>> SO DO I.

17:22.409 --> 17:23.843
>> YOU KNOW GWENDOLYN?

17:23.876 --> 17:24.844
>> FROM ANOTHER SITE.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.479
JFK ASSASSINATION STUFF.

17:26.513 --> 17:28.315
SHE HAS SOME GREAT PICTURES
OF THE GRASSY KNOLL

17:28.348 --> 17:29.516
THAT I'VE SHARED WITH HER.

17:29.549 --> 17:30.750
>> SO HOP ON AND CHAT HER UP.

17:30.783 --> 17:32.419
SEE IF SHE'LL GIVE US
WHERE HARRISON WENT.

17:32.452 --> 17:33.653
>> I'D RATHER
TALK TO GWEN IN PERSON.

17:33.686 --> 17:36.156
I KNOW WHERE SHE LOGS ON
TO THE INTERNET.

17:39.759 --> 17:41.794
>> FARTHEST TABLE FROM THE DOOR.

17:41.828 --> 17:43.830
BACK TO THE WALL.

17:43.863 --> 17:46.499
>> SPOT 'EM
BEFORE THEY SPOT YOU.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.668
JOHN.

17:48.701 --> 17:49.802
BEEN A LONG TIME.

17:49.836 --> 17:52.639
>> DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT,
SEEING YOU.

17:52.672 --> 17:56.243
>> YOU'RE NOT ON
THE JFK FORUM ANYMORE.

17:56.276 --> 17:58.411
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING?

17:58.445 --> 18:00.313
>> UH, OFFICIALLY, I'M RETIRED.

18:00.347 --> 18:01.348
>> MM-HMM.

18:01.381 --> 18:03.616
>> BUT, UH, BETWEEN YOU AND ME,

18:03.650 --> 18:05.885
I'M WORKING TO EXPOSE THE TRUTH.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.787
>> IT'S GOTTEN BAD, HUH?

18:07.820 --> 18:11.758
EVERY DAY I SEE ANOTHER ONE
OF THEIR ANTENNAS GOING UP.

18:11.791 --> 18:13.860
"CELL TOWERS."

18:13.893 --> 18:16.263
THEY THINK WE'RE SO STUPID.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.465
>> I HEAR
THEY GOT TO PETER HARRISON.

18:18.498 --> 18:19.332
>> YOU KNOW PETER?

18:19.366 --> 18:21.168
>> I MET HIM LAST YEAR
IN THE VILLAGE

18:21.201 --> 18:23.703
AT A TALK HE WAS GIVING
ON HOMELAND SECURITY'S PLANS

18:23.736 --> 18:25.338
FOR OUR WATER SUPPLY.

18:25.372 --> 18:28.641
>> YEAH. HE KNOWS TOO MUCH.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.643
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE AFTER HIM.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.416
>> THIS IS
A PRIVATE CONVERSATION.

18:39.319 --> 18:42.755
>> YOU ALWAYS
MADE ME FEEL SAFE, JOHN.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.758
>> GWEN, I REALLY
HAVE TO CONTACT PETER.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.827
>> WELL, WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I KNOW WHERE HE IS?

18:47.860 --> 18:48.928
>> HE TRUSTS YOU.

18:48.961 --> 18:52.799
HE TOLD ME THAT WHENEVER
HE POSTS ON PERSECUTE-U.COM,

18:52.832 --> 18:53.866
YOU'RE ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE

18:53.900 --> 18:55.602
THAT REALLY GETS IT.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.837
>> HE'S RUNNING.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.239
THEY WANT TO SILENCE HIM,

18:59.272 --> 19:00.673
BUT WE'RE NOT
GONNA LET THAT HAPPEN.

19:00.707 --> 19:01.674
>> WE?

19:01.708 --> 19:02.675
>> YEAH.

19:02.709 --> 19:05.378
PETER HAS FOLLOWERS.

19:05.412 --> 19:09.916
SO TELL ME WHY
YOU NEED TO FIND HIM.

19:09.949 --> 19:14.454
>> I CAN'T GIVE YOU ANY DETAILS
WITHOUT PUTTING YOU IN DANGER.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.823
TRUST ME.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.791
YOU KNOW ME, GWEN.

19:18.825 --> 19:22.562
YOU KNOW WHAT WE MEANT
TO EACH OTHER.

19:26.866 --> 19:29.769
>> THERE'S AN EMPTY STORE
AT 88th AND BROADWAY.

19:29.802 --> 19:30.903
PETER RENTS THE BASEMENT,

19:30.937 --> 19:34.207
TURNED IT INTO A SAFE ROOM
WITH EVERYTHING HE NEEDS.

19:34.241 --> 19:36.309
>> THANK YOU.

19:36.343 --> 19:37.377
>> HEY, JOHN.

19:37.410 --> 19:38.478
I WAS GONNA TELL YA,

19:38.511 --> 19:40.980
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT
GOING BACK ON MY MEDICATION,

19:41.013 --> 19:44.251
SO MAYBE WE COULD
BE TOGETHER AGAIN, HUH?

19:44.284 --> 19:45.352
>> GOOD-BYE, GWEN. I GOTTA GO.

19:45.385 --> 19:48.355
>> JOHN.
PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME, JOHN.

19:48.388 --> 19:49.422
>> I GOTTA GO.

19:49.456 --> 19:52.292
>> EVERYTHING'S GOING SO GOOD.

19:54.961 --> 19:57.230
>> SLY DOG.

19:57.264 --> 19:58.831
MAKING MOVES ON LOONEY LADY.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.733
>> SHE'S MY EX-WIFE.

20:06.539 --> 20:09.842
>> NYPD. PETER HARRISON,
SHOW YOURSELF.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.315
>> HARRISON, YOU'RE CORNERED.

20:15.348 --> 20:17.216
COME ON OUT.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.559
AAH!

20:26.593 --> 20:28.795
>> LEAVE ME ALONE!

20:28.828 --> 20:29.996
LEAVE ME ALONE.

20:30.029 --> 20:31.431
>> FREEZE!

20:31.464 --> 20:33.300
>> THE JUDGE TOLD YOU
TO LEAVE ME ALONE.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.435
>> THAT WAS BEFORE YOU KILLED
THAT GIRL AT CONEY ISLAND.

20:35.468 --> 20:36.669
>> I DIDN'T KILL ANYONE THERE.

20:36.703 --> 20:38.605
>> WE'VE GOT YOUR FINGERPRINTS,
DUMBASS.

20:38.638 --> 20:40.340
>> NO! I DIDN'T DO IT.

20:40.373 --> 20:42.409
AND I DIDN'T KILL YOU.

20:42.442 --> 20:44.544
YOU DID IT TO YOURSELF.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.416
[coughing]

21:01.761 --> 21:02.562
>> YOU SURE YOU'RE ALL RIGHT?

21:02.595 --> 21:03.896
>> TEN YEARS
IN THE CAR WITH MUNCH,

21:03.930 --> 21:05.598
I'VE SMELLED A LOT WORSE.

21:05.632 --> 21:06.833
>> YOU TWO
ARE LUCKY TO BE ALIVE.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.801
ANOTHER COUPLE SECONDS
BREATHING THAT GAS...

21:08.835 --> 21:09.802
>> WHAT WAS IT?

21:09.836 --> 21:11.003
>> HYDROGEN SULFIDE.

21:11.037 --> 21:12.639
MIX TOILET BOWL CLEANER,

21:12.672 --> 21:13.973
A COUPLE OTHER
HOUSEHOLD CHEMICALS--

21:14.006 --> 21:14.974
>> AND BAM!

21:15.007 --> 21:16.309
IT'S DETERGENT SUICIDE.

21:16.343 --> 21:17.710
I MEAN,
HARRISON DID HIS RESEARCH.

21:17.744 --> 21:19.512
"MAKE RICIN FROM CASTOR BEANS."

21:19.546 --> 21:21.514
"TEN IEDs YOU CAN BUILD
IN YOUR BASEMENT."

21:21.548 --> 21:24.751
>> PLEASE TELL US YOU FOUND HIM
IN THE CORNER STONE COLD.

21:24.784 --> 21:25.552
>> I WISH I COULD.

21:25.585 --> 21:27.554
BUT I DID
FIND HIS ESCAPE ROUTE.

21:27.587 --> 21:28.721
THERE'S A LADDER THAT LEADS

21:28.755 --> 21:30.089
UP TO A SEWER GRATE
ON THE STREET.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.858
>> ONCE AGAIN,
OUR KILLER'S IN THE WIND.

21:31.891 --> 21:32.992
>> YEAH, BUT I KNOW SOMEONE

21:33.025 --> 21:34.527
WHO CAN TELL US
WHERE HE'LL LAND.

21:34.561 --> 21:36.429
>> EVEN IF I KNEW WHERE HE WAS,

21:36.463 --> 21:37.630
WHICH I DON'T,
I COULDN'T TELL YOU.

21:37.664 --> 21:40.066
>> YOU REALLY WANNA INVOKE
YOUR ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE

21:40.099 --> 21:42.735
TO PROTECT A MAN
WHO'S ON A MURDER STREAK?

21:42.769 --> 21:44.371
>> IF PETER CONTACTS ME,

21:44.404 --> 21:46.072
I'LL URGE HIM
TO TURN HIMSELF IN.

21:46.105 --> 21:47.874
IN THE MEANTIME,
YOU DO YOUR JOB,

21:47.907 --> 21:48.875
AND I'LL DO MINE.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.042
>> RIGHT.
WELL, DOING OUR JOB

21:50.076 --> 21:51.578
NEARLY GOT ME KILLED.

21:51.611 --> 21:53.513
>> I'M SORRY.

21:53.546 --> 21:55.982
HE'S NEVER BEEN
THIS DELUSIONAL BEFORE.

21:56.015 --> 21:57.617
I'VE TRIED TO GET HIM
ON MEDICATION,

21:57.650 --> 21:58.751
BUT HE REFUSES.

21:58.785 --> 21:59.986
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU CARE ABOUT HIM.

22:00.019 --> 22:01.754
>> I'VE KNOWN PETER
SINCE HE WAS 17.

22:01.788 --> 22:03.856
HIS PARENTS WERE KILLED
IN A PLANE CRASH.

22:03.890 --> 22:05.625
I REPRESENTED HIM
IN THE CIVIL SUIT.

22:05.658 --> 22:06.759
GOT HIM A GOOD SETTLEMENT.

22:06.793 --> 22:08.661
I WAS HIS TRUSTEE
UNTIL HE TURNED 21.

22:08.695 --> 22:09.762
>> SO YOU TOOK CARE OF HIM.

22:09.796 --> 22:12.632
THAT STOP WHEN HE CAME OF AGE?

22:12.665 --> 22:15.835
>> PLAYING ON MY MATERNAL
INSTINCTS, DETECTIVE?

22:15.868 --> 22:17.604
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY?

22:17.637 --> 22:19.038
>> I WANT TO HELP PETER.

22:19.071 --> 22:21.608
RIGHT NOW HE'S A DANGER
TO HIMSELF AND THE COMMUNITY,

22:21.641 --> 22:22.742
BUT AS HIS LAWYER,

22:22.775 --> 22:24.076
I CAN'T BETRAY HIS CONFIDENCE.

22:24.110 --> 22:26.646
>> IS THERE ANYONE
THAT HE MIGHT TURN TO FOR HELP?

22:26.679 --> 22:28.981
ANYONE WHOSE HANDS AREN'T TIED?

22:29.015 --> 22:30.717
>> BEFORE HE GOT SICK,

22:30.750 --> 22:33.052
PETER WAS AT THE GOTHAM SCHOOL
OF FINE ARTS.

22:33.085 --> 22:35.455
HE WAS CLOSE
TO A PROFESSOR THERE.

22:35.488 --> 22:38.157
EDGAR RADZINZKI.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.593
>> I HAVEN'T SEEN PETER
IN MONTHS.

22:40.627 --> 22:41.694
HE SHOULD COME TO ME.

22:41.728 --> 22:42.795
THE BOY NEEDS HELP.

22:42.829 --> 22:47.033
>> HE NEEDS MORE THAN THAT.
HE'S KILLED TWO PEOPLE.

22:47.066 --> 22:48.034
>> [exhales]

22:48.067 --> 22:49.502
>> YOU DON'T SEEM SURPRISED.

22:49.536 --> 22:51.170
>> I COULD TELL HIS ILLNESS
WAS GETTING WORSE.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.705
HIS WORK HAS OFTEN BEEN DARK,

22:52.739 --> 22:55.608
BUT THIS WEEK,
THE SHADOWS OVERWHELM THE LIGHT.

22:55.642 --> 22:57.444
>> YOU JUST SAID
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HIM RECENTLY.

22:57.477 --> 22:58.578
>> PETER, NO.
HIS PAINTINGS, YES.

22:58.611 --> 22:59.612
WHEN HE DROPPED OUT,

22:59.646 --> 23:00.947
I ENCOURAGED HIM
TO KEEP WORKING.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.615
I THOUGHT HE WOULD
EXERCISE HIS DEMONS

23:02.649 --> 23:03.616
THROUGH HIS ART.

23:03.650 --> 23:04.417
>> THE DEMONS WON.

23:04.451 --> 23:05.818
>> WHERE DID YOU
SEE HIS PAINTINGS?

23:05.852 --> 23:07.554
>> I LET HIM
KEEP THE KEYS TO HIS STUDIO.

23:07.587 --> 23:09.589
HE COMES AT NIGHT
WHEN NO ONE'S AROUND.

23:09.622 --> 23:11.724
ALWAYS GONE BY MORNING.

23:14.994 --> 23:16.796
>> WOW.

23:18.498 --> 23:20.600
>> EXCEPTIONAL, AREN'T THEY?

23:20.633 --> 23:23.903
>> IT'S MORE LIKE
DANTE'S INFERNO MEETS NEWSWEEK.

23:23.936 --> 23:26.606
>> COLLAGE IS NOT
JUST FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN.

23:26.639 --> 23:30.109
PICASSO AND BACH RECOGNIZED
THE POWER OF THE MEDIUM

23:30.142 --> 23:31.844
FOR MODERNIST ART.

23:31.878 --> 23:34.881
PETER WOULD HAVE PUSHED
THE BOUNDARIES FURTHER.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.616
>> SO WHAT STOPPED HIM?

23:36.649 --> 23:38.117
>> 9-11.

23:38.150 --> 23:39.686
AFTER THE TOWERS FELL,

23:39.719 --> 23:41.988
PETER BECAME OBSESSED.

23:42.021 --> 23:44.624
HE WOULD GO ON
ANTI-GOVERNMENT RANTS,

23:44.657 --> 23:47.694
SPOUT THE MOST
BIZARRE CONSPIRACY THEORIES.

23:47.727 --> 23:48.628
IT TOOK OVER HIS WORK.

23:48.661 --> 23:51.631
>> EL, LOOK AT THIS.

23:51.664 --> 23:55.568
"MADMAN ON THE LOOSE"?

23:55.602 --> 23:57.604
>> THAT'S FROM
YESTERDAY'S PAPER.

23:57.637 --> 24:00.673
>> HE'S RENDERED
HIS OWN PERSECUTION.

24:00.707 --> 24:04.577
EVEN IN MADNESS,
THE CREATIVE IMPULSE REMAINS.

24:04.611 --> 24:07.146
>> GEE, THIS IS BETTER
THAN THE CONFESSION

24:07.179 --> 24:09.682
LIV AND ELLIOT DIDN'T GET.

24:09.716 --> 24:13.686
UH, SO RED PAINT--BLOOD.

24:13.720 --> 24:14.654
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A KNIFE.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.789
>> AND YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
IN THE WRONG BUILDING.

24:16.823 --> 24:18.658
>> STUCKEY'S
SOLVING OUR CRIME FOR US.

24:18.691 --> 24:19.826
>> AS USUAL.

24:19.859 --> 24:21.193
>> PRETTY CLEAR, RIGHT?

24:21.227 --> 24:23.730
I MEAN, FACES OF THE GUYS
HE'S GONNA KILL NEXT.

24:23.763 --> 24:25.164
LOOKS LIKE
HE'S JUST GETTING STARTED.

24:25.197 --> 24:26.032
>> WHY DON'T YOU PUT IT DOWN

24:26.065 --> 24:28.234
BEFORE YOU CONTAMINATE
MORE EVIDENCE?

24:28.267 --> 24:33.773
>> RIGHT, UM,
BUT LOOKS LIKE LIV.

24:33.806 --> 24:35.508
A LITTLE YOUNGER.

24:35.542 --> 24:36.909
>> YOU ARE AN OBNOXIOUS
LITTLE JACKHOLE.

24:36.943 --> 24:37.910
>> ELLIOT, IT'S NOT--

24:37.944 --> 24:39.646
>> LET HIM GO. LET HIM GO.

24:39.679 --> 24:44.016
>> GET OUT OF HERE.

24:44.050 --> 24:45.652
>> CAPTAIN,
HE JUST ASSAULTED ME.

24:45.685 --> 24:46.786
YOU HAVE TO WRITE HIM UP.

24:46.819 --> 24:49.288
>> ONLY ONE GETTING A RIP
AROUND HERE IS YOU, DALE.

24:49.321 --> 24:50.757
>> HE JUST ACCOSTED ME.

24:50.790 --> 24:53.159
>> IF ELLIOT PUTS YOUR HEAD
THROUGH A WALL,

24:53.192 --> 24:55.795
I'M GONNA HAVE TO DO A LOT
OF TIRESOME PAPERWORK.

24:55.828 --> 24:57.063
GET OUT OF MY SQUAD.

24:57.096 --> 24:58.731
>> CAPTAIN, LISTEN TO THIS.

24:58.765 --> 25:01.801
>> I KNOW YOU'RE ANGRY.
I WANT TO HELP YOU.

25:01.834 --> 25:03.169
>> SOUNDS LIKE JULIA ZIMMER.

25:03.202 --> 25:04.637
[glass breaks]
>> PETER, DON'T.

25:04.671 --> 25:05.772
>> PETER HARRISON'S THERE.
>> GO.

25:05.805 --> 25:07.674
>> HELP. DO YOU HEAR ME?

25:07.707 --> 25:09.642
PETER, I'M YOUR FRIEND.

25:09.676 --> 25:10.910
>> FRIENDS CAN'T BE TRUSTED.

25:10.943 --> 25:12.645
EVERYONE IS COMPROMISED.

25:12.679 --> 25:14.681
THERE ARE TRAITORS EVERYWHERE.

25:14.714 --> 25:16.916
I CAN'T SEE THEM,
BUT THEY'RE HERE.

25:16.949 --> 25:18.585
THEY'RE ALWAYS HERE.

25:18.618 --> 25:19.619
>> I DON'T THINK
HE HAS A WEAPON.

25:19.652 --> 25:21.688
>> CIA MIND CONTROL.

25:21.721 --> 25:22.789
THEY USE RUBY LASERS

25:22.822 --> 25:24.991
TO ALTER OUR THOUGHTS.

25:25.024 --> 25:27.259
NO!

25:27.293 --> 25:28.294
>> PETER, NO!

25:28.327 --> 25:29.629
NO, NO, STOP!

25:29.662 --> 25:30.630
>> STAND BACK.

25:30.663 --> 25:31.664
ARE YOU OKAY?

25:31.698 --> 25:32.665
>> YEAH.

25:32.699 --> 25:34.333
HE SHOWED UP OUT OF CONTROL.

25:34.366 --> 25:35.735
THREW THIS AT ME.

25:35.768 --> 25:36.703
IT'S WHAT SET HIM OFF.

25:36.736 --> 25:38.070
>> WELL, TOMORROW IT'LL SAY

25:38.104 --> 25:39.171
THAT THE CITY IS SAFE AGAIN.

25:39.205 --> 25:40.807
>> I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE ETHICS BOARD

25:40.840 --> 25:41.774
WILL SAY ABOUT ME CALLING YOU.

25:41.808 --> 25:43.743
>> THAT YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.

25:43.776 --> 25:46.779
>> TRAITOR!

25:46.813 --> 25:48.748
DECEIVER.

25:48.781 --> 25:50.717
YOU'LL PAY.

25:50.750 --> 25:53.052
ALL BETRAYERS MUST PAY.

25:55.622 --> 25:56.689
NOT GITMO.
>> CALM DOWN.

25:56.723 --> 25:58.257
>> PLEASE, NOT A SECRET PRISON.
NOT THE BLACK HOLE.

25:58.290 --> 26:00.226
>> WE'RE JUST TAKING YOU
TO THE PRECINCT. THAT'S ALL.

26:00.259 --> 26:01.894
>> I'LL MEET YOU THERE.

26:03.963 --> 26:05.698
>> YOU SURE YOU STILL
WANNA TO REPRESENT HIM?

26:05.732 --> 26:07.233
>> I KNOW HOW ILL PETER IS.

26:07.266 --> 26:09.068
I CAN USE THAT TO HELP HIM.

26:14.807 --> 26:17.276
[gas hissing]

26:19.311 --> 26:23.783
[honking horn]

26:23.816 --> 26:26.719
[coughing]

26:26.753 --> 26:28.921
[tires screech]

26:28.955 --> 26:31.323
[horn honks]

26:34.326 --> 26:36.295
>> HELP ME! HELP ME!

26:36.328 --> 26:38.698
>> I CAN'T GET THE DOOR OPEN!

26:38.731 --> 26:40.800
>> [groans]

26:40.833 --> 26:43.235
I TRIED TO WARN HER.

26:43.269 --> 26:45.104
NO ONE GETS OUT ALIVE!

26:45.137 --> 26:48.074
'CAUSE THE TENTACLES
ARE EVERYWHERE!

26:57.049 --> 26:59.051
DEATH TO ALL BETRAYERS!

26:59.085 --> 27:02.121
ALL OF THEM!

27:08.294 --> 27:09.261
>> TAKE ZOMBIE BOY

27:09.295 --> 27:10.262
TO THE PRISON WARD
AT BELLEVUE.

27:10.296 --> 27:11.263
DO NOT PASS GO,

27:11.297 --> 27:12.264
DON'T COLLECT $200.

27:12.298 --> 27:13.700
>> COULD HAVE BEEN US.

27:13.733 --> 27:14.767
>> SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN HER.

27:14.801 --> 27:16.068
>> CHECK THIS OUT.

27:16.102 --> 27:17.069
SAME SETUP.

27:17.103 --> 27:18.337
COUPLE OF TWO-LITER BOTTLES.

27:18.370 --> 27:20.139
ONE WITH AMMONIA,
THE OTHER WITH SULFUR,

27:20.172 --> 27:21.674
HARD-WIRED TO THE IGNITION.

27:21.708 --> 27:24.076
SHE TURNED THE KEY,

IN HERE.

28:54.033 --> 28:56.869
>> DOES YOUR SYMPATHY
EXTEND TO PETER HARRISON?

ITS STOMACH WAS FULL OF BLOOD.

29:15.487 --> 29:17.256
SINCE JULIA HAD JUST
GOTTEN INTO THE CAR,

29:17.289 --> 29:19.025
THERE'S NO WAY IT HAD TIME
TO FEED ON HER.

29:19.058 --> 29:19.959

I DIDN'T SEE IT TILL I PULLED
THE RIG FROM THE CAR.

37:43.362 --> 37:47.333
WHOSE LIFE IS HELL
BECAUSE OF THIS PRICK?

37:47.366 --> 37:48.534
"LIV, DO THIS.

37:48.567 --> 37:51.002

37:51.036 --> 37:52.704
I'M SICK OF IT.

38:13.091 --> 38:16.061
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

38:16.094 --> 38:18.397
>> IF YOU KNEW HALF

38:18.430 --> 38:22.067
OF WHAT THIS PRICK HAS DONE.

38:22.100 --> 38:26.104
SOMEBODY NEEDS TO TAKE HIM OUT.

38:26.137 --> 38:29.341
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW
YOU FELT THE SAME WAY AS I DID.

38:29.375 --> 38:30.409
I'VE NEVER HAD ANYBODY--

38:30.442 --> 38:31.777
>> STUCKEY, DON'T LISTEN TO HER.

38:31.810 --> 38:33.512
SHE'LL TURN ON YOU

>> WHAT ABOUT CRAGEN?

38:45.056 --> 38:47.993
>> I GOT CRAGEN WRAPPED
AROUND MY LITTLE FINGER.

38:48.026 --> 38:50.462
THE SAME GOES
WITH MUNCH AND FIN.

38:50.496 --> 38:53.532
DALE, IF I SAY THE WORD,

38:53.565 --> 38:57.669

39:00.105 --> 39:02.374
>> I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT.

39:02.408 --> 39:06.545
>> YOU LIKE IT
BECAUSE WE GET EACH OTHER.

39:06.578 --> 39:10.081
WE'RE CONNECTED.

39:10.115 --> 39:12.618
WE'RE CONNECTED.

39:12.651 --> 39:15.153

OF THE THIRD WHEEL.

39:24.095 --> 39:26.064
>> WAIT.

39:26.097 --> 39:28.366
JUST WAIT ONE SECOND.

39:32.170 --> 39:34.506
I WANT HIM TO WATCH.

39:34.540 --> 39:38.677
