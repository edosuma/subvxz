00:38.263 --> 00:39.921
What the hell is this?

00:39.921 --> 00:42.847
In your cells, fellas.
In your cells.

00:44.269 --> 00:46.450
You think you're funny, Lowry?

00:46.450 --> 00:48.604
Humor was not my goal.

00:48.604 --> 00:51.494
I thought a bath would be delicious.

00:51.494 --> 00:53.183
Now, you lap it up, Blanche.

00:53.183 --> 00:55.238
- Get your hands off of me.
- Lap it up.

00:55.238 --> 00:57.232
Get your hands off of me.

00:57.232 --> 01:00.123
Get off. Get off.

01:00.855 --> 01:03.237
I want my mommy!

01:03.237 --> 01:05.671
I want my mommy.

01:05.671 --> 01:08.624
Bring me my mommy.

01:18.506 --> 01:22.185
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm homeless and hungry.

01:32.064 --> 01:35.891
You see this brick?
I could use this brick.

01:35.891 --> 01:37.505
But I don't want to.

01:37.505 --> 01:40.061
I'm going to put it away.

01:45.460 --> 01:46.939
Thank you.

01:49.833 --> 01:53.207
Don't pass me by.
I'm hungry.

01:53.667 --> 01:55.815
Don't pass me by.

01:55.815 --> 01:57.723
I'm a human being.

01:59.365 --> 02:01.019
Human being.

02:01.778 --> 02:03.345
Human being.

02:03.345 --> 02:05.304
Excuse me, sir.

02:06.815 --> 02:09.304
I got $20 here.

02:09.675 --> 02:12.495
I could use a brick like that.

02:36.037 --> 02:39.283
Oh, no, no water.
No...

02:39.283 --> 02:41.959
How many days?
Too long.

02:41.959 --> 02:43.936
It isn't fair.

02:43.936 --> 02:46.500
I'm not a duck, duck, duck.

02:48.999 --> 02:51.969
I'm not a goose, goose, goose.

03:28.760 --> 03:30.370
What happened to him?

03:30.744 --> 03:32.364
What did you do to him?

03:32.364 --> 03:34.330
What did you do to him, huh?

03:34.330 --> 03:36.118
I know you can hear me.

03:36.118 --> 03:38.290
What did you do to him?

04:22.730 --> 04:24.706
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON USA: 2007/12/06

04:26.075 --> 04:27.718
Detective Eames?

04:28.726 --> 04:30.802
If I'm lucky, you don't remember me.

04:30.802 --> 04:32.682
I'm Frank. Goren.

04:32.682 --> 04:34.125
I know who you are.

04:34.125 --> 04:36.401
Last time I saw you,
I was on the soup line.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.047
Not my best moment.

04:38.047 --> 04:41.934
What about the last time I didn't see you
at your mother's funeral?

04:41.934 --> 04:44.586
Yeah. I started using again.

04:44.586 --> 04:46.760
The day she died.

04:47.016 --> 04:49.748
Took me a while to hit bottom, and...

04:49.991 --> 04:52.601
I don't know,
found my way back to church.

04:52.601 --> 04:55.530
My higher power
was looking out for me.

04:55.530 --> 04:58.301
How long have you been
waiting out here, Frank?

04:58.301 --> 04:59.455
About a half hour.

04:59.455 --> 05:04.249
Because Bobby goes to work before I do,
which means you saw him,

05:04.249 --> 05:07.275
and you were waiting for me.
Thanks.

05:07.275 --> 05:10.045
Detective, Bobby's written me off.

05:10.045 --> 05:12.293
Which is fair enough.
But I need his help.

05:12.293 --> 05:15.050
- I can't do that.
- I have a son.

05:16.401 --> 05:17.591
Congratulations.

05:17.591 --> 05:19.555
He's 19.
He's in trouble.

05:19.555 --> 05:22.832
It's a police matter.
Bobby could help.

05:24.644 --> 05:27.170
I'm not getting in the middle.

05:29.513 --> 05:31.807
I had to ask.

05:38.057 --> 05:38.777
Frank.

05:40.441 --> 05:41.762
He has a son.

05:41.762 --> 05:44.377
Frank's a junkie, Eames.
He'll say anything.

05:44.377 --> 05:47.158
- He didn't ask for money.
- Just wait.

05:47.158 --> 05:49.434
For what it's worth,
I don't think Frank's using.

05:49.434 --> 05:50.969
He looked healthy.

05:50.969 --> 05:53.082
And he took responsibility for his past.

05:53.082 --> 05:57.688
When Frank is not in program,
Frank talks program.

06:05.544 --> 06:08.737
So what... you said...
he's downstairs?

06:09.986 --> 06:12.043
I didn't promise him anything.

06:12.043 --> 06:14.061
Bet he thinks you did.

06:14.797 --> 06:17.587
So what'd you do with it, Frank?
You see it to get your next fix?

06:17.587 --> 06:20.485
Mom's ring? / Bobby, if that's
what you're upset about...

06:20.485 --> 06:22.308
She gave me the ring, okay?
She gave it to me.

06:22.308 --> 06:24.837
She'd never give you her engagement ring.
She'd know that you sell it.

06:24.837 --> 06:27.808
That's why she gave it to me.
Mom knew I needed money.

06:27.808 --> 06:29.459
Every single time I went to see her,

06:29.459 --> 06:32.414
she'd slip me a 20
like I was a teenager.

06:32.414 --> 06:33.559
Yeah? Every time?

06:33.559 --> 06:35.268
What'd that come out to,
like 40 bucks?

06:35.268 --> 06:40.124
All right, look... you're angry, man.
I deserve it.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.267
But he doesn't.

06:44.112 --> 06:47.336
That's your nephew.
Donny.

06:48.144 --> 06:50.240
- This is your son.
- Yeah.

06:50.240 --> 06:53.545
- He doesn't look like you.
- No, he doesn't.

06:55.367 --> 06:57.871
He looks like you.

06:58.386 --> 07:01.166
He lives in Pennsylvania with his mom.

07:01.166 --> 07:03.291
And you're his father.

07:03.523 --> 07:05.971
So how come you're just
telling me about this now?

07:05.971 --> 07:08.804
I would have ruined the kid, Bobby.

07:09.511 --> 07:12.393
Now that I'm clean,
his mom lets me see him.

07:12.393 --> 07:15.217
Mom know about... Donny?

07:15.217 --> 07:17.668
I disappeared before he was born.

07:17.668 --> 07:20.303
How was I gonna tell mom that?

07:22.421 --> 07:26.339
Do you know what it would
have meant to her to...

07:26.657 --> 07:31.047
to, to know that she had a grandson?

07:32.201 --> 07:34.018
All right.

07:35.430 --> 07:38.623
- So? / So.
- Well, he's in trouble?

07:38.623 --> 07:39.832
Is it drugs?

07:39.832 --> 07:42.409
No, Donny doesn't use.

07:42.409 --> 07:44.839
He was riding in a car
that had drugs in it.

07:44.839 --> 07:47.364
He got a year for possession.

07:47.364 --> 07:49.287
I can't do anything in Pennsylvania.

07:49.287 --> 07:52.208
No, he was arrested in upstate New York.

07:52.208 --> 07:55.815
He's at, um... Tates Corrections.

07:55.815 --> 07:59.265
I'm okay with Donny doing the time.

07:59.265 --> 08:01.873
But the kid called me last week.
He was totally freaked out.

08:01.873 --> 08:04.013
He's having nightmares
and I don't know what else.

08:04.013 --> 08:05.410
What do you mean?

08:05.410 --> 08:07.267
You mean like voices or visions?

08:07.267 --> 08:10.230
If he's bipolar, he goes off his meds,
that could give him nightmares.

08:10.230 --> 08:12.959
No, I'm not talking about
something like mom's thing.

08:13.566 --> 08:16.525
He's a kid, and he's scared.

08:16.525 --> 08:20.191
He's saw some really
terrible stuff in jail.

08:20.191 --> 08:22.018
He wants to talk to you about it himself.

08:22.018 --> 08:22.768
Me?

08:24.544 --> 08:26.794
Did you tell him I was a cop?

08:26.794 --> 08:28.980
I'm proud of you, Bobby.

08:33.090 --> 08:34.587
What's his last name?

08:34.587 --> 08:38.063
Carlson. With a "C."
So you'll go?

08:38.063 --> 08:39.530
- I'll look into it.
- Thanks, man.

08:39.530 --> 08:42.142
- That's all, all right?
- Come on.

08:43.480 --> 08:45.670
Hey, Bobby, thank you.

08:46.978 --> 08:49.473
Donny was arrested in Truby.
New York, four months ago.

08:49.473 --> 08:53.073
Cops found crystal meth in
the car that he was riding in.

08:53.073 --> 08:55.214
Got a year and a day
at Tates Corrections.

08:55.214 --> 08:57.454
Well, that's tough.
What'd the driver get?

08:57.454 --> 08:59.993
Tom Huffaker was driving drunk.

08:59.993 --> 09:02.458
Has possession priors.
He got time served.

09:02.458 --> 09:05.302
What, he caught a break
for turning on Donny?

09:05.302 --> 09:09.413
When I called the Truby PD, they connected
me to the town supervisor's office.

09:09.413 --> 09:11.913
Harry Huffaker.

09:11.913 --> 09:15.156
So Tom's dad had an in with the judge.

09:15.156 --> 09:16.774
Some judge.

09:16.774 --> 09:21.126
Truby's a village with a part-time justice,
Judge Clyde Averton.

09:21.126 --> 09:23.550
He's not a lawyer.
He's a car dealer.

09:23.550 --> 09:25.745
Donny got screwed.

09:25.745 --> 09:31.667
Twice... last month, he was transferred
to the Mental Observation Unit.

09:31.667 --> 09:34.832
The New York State village
justice system.

09:34.832 --> 09:36.873
Amateur hour.

09:36.873 --> 09:40.074
You've got mechanics, crossing guards,
people with no legal training

09:40.074 --> 09:42.423
ruling on cases from their rec rooms.

09:42.423 --> 09:44.473
That's how Donny ended up in Tates.

09:44.473 --> 09:46.811
He's got eight more months to serve.

09:46.811 --> 09:48.525
In a prison that's what...

09:48.525 --> 09:51.131
300 miles outside our jurisdiction?

09:51.131 --> 09:53.024
Well, if he's dirty, he's dirty.

09:53.024 --> 09:57.416
I just feel the arrest is sketchy and...

09:58.039 --> 10:01.369
He's my nephew,
and I wanna help him.

10:01.369 --> 10:03.663
Now, he's your nephew,

10:03.663 --> 10:07.059
we'll keep your fingerprints
off this starting now.

10:07.059 --> 10:09.525
I need a word with your partner.

10:09.789 --> 10:12.373
Shouldn't I stay in here for this?

10:21.556 --> 10:25.720
I understand. You're worried about Bobby
upstate dealing with Tates.

10:25.720 --> 10:28.153
I can be the face person on this.

10:28.153 --> 10:30.294
No. Not you either.

10:30.294 --> 10:32.927
There's a crystal meth task force.

10:32.927 --> 10:35.791
- A friend from vice is on it.
- Good.

10:35.791 --> 10:37.389
Have him talk to the ADA

10:37.389 --> 10:40.851
and request that Donny be transferred
to Rikers as a witness.

10:40.851 --> 10:44.482
And make sure the trail
doesn't lead back here.

11:05.627 --> 11:07.557
It's yours.

11:28.908 --> 11:30.981
They told me I was bipolar.

11:30.981 --> 11:33.669
So they moved me out of gen pop to MO.

11:33.669 --> 11:36.685
They put me on these meds
which I stopped taking.

11:36.685 --> 11:38.921
Cause they make me
go to the bathroom too much.

11:38.921 --> 11:40.739
Don't say gen pop.

11:40.739 --> 11:44.021
It makes you sound like
you've been in too long.

11:45.634 --> 11:48.457
So you went off your meds.
What happened?

11:48.457 --> 11:51.410
I mouthed off to a couple COs.

11:52.131 --> 11:54.045
Mom says I have authority issuers.

11:54.045 --> 11:58.899
Well... my mom said that to me too.
Doesn't mean you're crazy.

11:58.899 --> 12:03.525
If you ask me, the people who are really crazy
are the people who watch reality television,

12:03.525 --> 12:06.540
hook up with strangers on the Internet.

12:07.225 --> 12:10.441
- That's everyone, though.
- Yeah.

12:11.628 --> 12:13.535
Uh...

12:17.811 --> 12:22.398
I don't know you.
You seem like a smart kid.

12:22.398 --> 12:24.382
What are you doing selling drugs?

12:24.382 --> 12:26.798
I'm... I wasn't.

12:26.798 --> 12:31.629
Huffaker goes to Altoona College,
which is where I do janitorial, okay?

12:31.629 --> 12:33.940
Now, one day, he comes up to me,

12:33.940 --> 12:36.680
says he's gonna go up to Truby
and he wants company for the drive up.

12:36.680 --> 12:38.597
Company... what?
He's on a meth run.

12:38.597 --> 12:39.915
He wanted a fall guy.

12:39.915 --> 12:42.604
Well, he got one, cause that's why
I'm here at Rikers right now.

12:42.604 --> 12:44.793
And he's probably back at class.

12:44.793 --> 12:48.570
Don't get me wrong, though.
I'd rather be here than back at Tates.

12:50.071 --> 12:52.100
You know that this transfer's
temporary, right?

12:52.100 --> 12:54.455
You gotta go back there.

12:55.059 --> 12:58.602
Please don't send me back there.
Please do not send me back there.

12:58.602 --> 13:01.563
- Jail's jail.
- Jail I can take, okay?

13:01.563 --> 13:05.690
Up at Tates, they're killing people,
and they know I know.

13:11.991 --> 13:14.231
Tates did have a death last week

13:14.231 --> 13:18.451
In the mental observation unit.
Jay Lowry, 21.

13:18.451 --> 13:23.532
Penny ante arrests... shoplifting,
loitering for purposes of prostitution.

13:23.532 --> 13:26.743
The report says he died
of natural causes.

13:26.743 --> 13:28.481
At 21?

13:28.709 --> 13:30.616
Jay have any health problems?

13:30.616 --> 13:34.120
Schizophrenia and bad teeth.

13:34.120 --> 13:36.296
A fey kid like this...

13:36.296 --> 13:39.634
Be an easy target for sadistic COs.

13:39.634 --> 13:42.766
I've just been informed
Donny Carlson is in holding.

13:42.766 --> 13:48.003
Yeah, uh... I couldn't
evaluate him in Rikers.

13:48.003 --> 13:50.374
It was noisy and...

13:50.374 --> 13:53.504
I don't have lot of time.

13:53.807 --> 13:56.629
He asked for tea.
Here.

13:57.732 --> 13:59.760
Thanks, Captain.

14:00.029 --> 14:01.296
Okay, this is what we have.

14:01.296 --> 14:02.352
That's him.
That's the guy.

14:02.352 --> 14:03.688
That's the guy that they killed.

14:03.688 --> 14:05.273
He flooded his cell,
then they took him to heaven.

14:05.273 --> 14:07.921
Okay, slow yourself down.
You're talking fast. Do you know that?

14:07.921 --> 14:10.000
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Okay.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.410
Now, they took him to heaven...

14:11.410 --> 14:13.266
That's not the heaven
that I'm talking about, okay?

14:13.266 --> 14:16.475
There's an isolation unit.
It's a room in... in Tates, okay?

14:16.475 --> 14:18.576
Heaven is a room in Tates
in the isolation unit

14:18.576 --> 14:19.848
which is six different cells.

14:19.848 --> 14:21.838
They, they have a completely
different room that they call heaven.

14:21.838 --> 14:23.724
Okay, heaven.
And they use restraints there?

14:23.724 --> 14:25.036
Yes, they use restraints there.

14:25.036 --> 14:28.087
They strap you to a slab until they
break you or they kill you, just like Lowry.

14:28.087 --> 14:29.531
And you're sure that they killed him,

14:29.531 --> 14:31.852
because the report says
that he died of natural causes.

14:31.852 --> 14:32.888
You called the warden?

14:32.888 --> 14:34.974
Now she's gonna know that I'm
telling you about this murder,

14:34.974 --> 14:36.127
and then she's gonna kill me.

14:36.127 --> 14:37.471
We didn't call the warden.

14:37.471 --> 14:39.218
And you're sounding a little paranoid.

14:39.218 --> 14:40.765
I think I got a little right to be
paranoid, okay?

14:40.765 --> 14:42.137
I heard what I heard.

14:42.137 --> 14:44.479
If you wanna hear it from the shrink,
her name is Dr. Stern.

14:44.479 --> 14:46.359
Go ahead and ask her.
Just don't send me back there.

14:46.359 --> 14:49.510
Calm yourself down. Okay.
Let's sit down, sit down here.

14:49.510 --> 14:52.176
Sit down and calm yourself.

14:57.291 --> 15:00.047
Dad tells me that your mom just died.

15:00.047 --> 15:02.137
Nut job.

15:03.838 --> 15:06.873
- You think I have what she had?
- No.

15:07.359 --> 15:09.815
I don't think that.

15:13.785 --> 15:17.007
Task force ADA heard
from the warden at Tates

15:17.007 --> 15:21.517
who was surprised they subpoenaed Donny
as a witness considering his history of hallucinations.

15:21.517 --> 15:25.728
Donny says he saw the COs
kill an inmate.

15:25.728 --> 15:30.404
Now, the warden, she worried about
what he knows.

15:30.404 --> 15:32.006
She's discrediting him.

15:32.006 --> 15:36.258
Whatever's going on up there,
it's not in our jurisdiction.

15:38.829 --> 15:41.373
Understood, Captain.

15:44.374 --> 15:46.784
It's an interesting photo.

15:46.784 --> 15:49.722
Jay's wearing a hockey uniform.

15:50.630 --> 15:53.136
He's got a princess on his cake.

15:53.136 --> 15:55.870
Jay was such a sweet boy.

15:55.870 --> 15:58.727
Every mother envied me.

16:00.252 --> 16:05.734
Mrs. Lowry, did the warden tell you
the cause of Jay's death?

16:05.734 --> 16:07.893
She said he died of an infection.

16:07.893 --> 16:09.842
What are you after?

16:10.333 --> 16:14.274
Why do two city cops care
about what goes on up here?

16:14.274 --> 16:20.132
We talked to a witness who believes
Jay didn't die a natural death.

16:20.132 --> 16:22.483
- Oh, God.
- No, no, no. Look.

16:22.483 --> 16:24.316
Jay's finally at peace.

16:24.316 --> 16:25.942
Leave him and us alone.

16:25.942 --> 16:29.428
The warden said infection.

16:29.428 --> 16:33.851
You think that he died of AIDS.
Jay didn't have AIDS.

16:33.851 --> 16:36.684
We think Jay was mistreated by guards

16:36.684 --> 16:39.347
and that it resulted in his death.

16:39.347 --> 16:42.864
- I'm not listening to this crap.
- Don't you walk away, James.

16:42.864 --> 16:44.406
They're talking about our son.

16:44.406 --> 16:46.357
He wasn't our son.

16:46.357 --> 16:48.470
He wore dresses, lipstick.
He wanted to get an operation.

16:48.470 --> 16:50.532
He was a freak.

16:50.943 --> 16:54.553
We hope that Jay's at peace.

16:54.553 --> 17:01.784
But you are not gonna have peace
until you find out how he really died.

17:04.086 --> 17:06.904
What are you asking us to do?

17:08.406 --> 17:10.544
Infection... no.

17:10.544 --> 17:15.482
Severe dehydration based on blood work
and urinalysis down at the hospital.

17:15.482 --> 17:18.060
We're talking at least
four days without any water.

17:18.060 --> 17:20.829
And these bruises on the wrist...
from restraints?

17:20.829 --> 17:22.030
The ankles too?

17:22.030 --> 17:23.763
Once I scrubbed off
the mortician's makeup,

17:23.763 --> 17:27.492
I found bruises around
the wrists, ankles, and pelvis.

17:27.492 --> 17:30.280
Biopsy revealed chronic and acute trauma.

17:30.280 --> 17:33.663
- From restraints.
- Very likely.

17:33.663 --> 17:38.574
Donny was right.
Jay Lowry was tortured to death.

17:44.724 --> 17:45.444
Donny.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.749
Just got off the phone
with an upstate police Captain.

17:56.749 --> 17:59.078
Wants to know why my detectives
were in his jurisdiction.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.387
Captain, something's bad up there.

18:01.387 --> 18:03.811
They're torturing prisoners
for minor infractions...

18:03.811 --> 18:05.757
Then we should notify the state IG.

18:05.757 --> 18:06.948
Where's Donny?

18:06.948 --> 18:08.439
Bobby, I was...

18:08.439 --> 18:12.293
The ADA couldn't extend his transfer.
He went back to Tates this morning.

18:12.293 --> 18:14.211
You can't send him back there.
He's at risk.

18:14.211 --> 18:15.863
We did everything we could, Detective.

18:15.863 --> 18:17.166
Cause of what he knows.

18:17.166 --> 18:19.657
Then we shouldn't draw attention to him.
When this dies down...

18:19.657 --> 18:20.718
When it dies down?

18:20.718 --> 18:23.768
- We'll ask the ADA to speak to the warden.
- When it dies down?

18:23.768 --> 18:26.311
- Put Donny into protective custody.
- That's not good enough!

18:26.311 --> 18:28.798
Are you crazy?

18:31.259 --> 18:34.130
Detective, in my office, now.

18:37.029 --> 18:40.115
Captain, listen.
The warden.

18:40.115 --> 18:43.711
Donny says that everything that
happens there is under her orders.

18:43.711 --> 18:45.347
You send him back there,

18:45.347 --> 18:47.979
she'll make sure that Donny
never talks to anyone again.

18:47.979 --> 18:49.926
Sounds a little paranoid, Detective.

18:49.926 --> 18:51.121
It does?

18:51.121 --> 18:54.597
I know you're worried about
your nephew's safety and mental health.

18:54.597 --> 18:56.148
I'm worried about yours.

18:56.148 --> 18:59.338
I'm fine. How are you?

19:00.404 --> 19:02.532
You've been under a lot of stress.

19:02.532 --> 19:04.877
I can tell you're not sleeping.

19:04.877 --> 19:08.202
I need you to take a week's sick leave.

19:11.854 --> 19:14.953
Uh... there's nothing wrong with me.

19:15.205 --> 19:16.540
One week.

19:16.540 --> 19:19.703
Don't come back till you've
been to psych services.

19:23.681 --> 19:25.913
There's nothing wrong with me.

19:31.458 --> 19:35.717
I'm on sick leave...

19:38.448 --> 19:44.512
then he gives me a... rubber gun.

20:07.680 --> 20:13.713
So you need us to input a 30-year work,
financial, and medical history for this guy?

20:15.073 --> 20:17.714
Yeah, we can do that.

20:18.042 --> 20:22.103
If anyone asks, you didn't help me.

20:38.272 --> 20:42.245
Sir, you look mesmerized by this car.

20:42.579 --> 20:47.043
And, sir, this judge is gonna
make sure you get a fair deal.

20:47.043 --> 20:49.138
This brick here...

20:50.386 --> 20:52.697
Why don't you...

20:52.697 --> 20:54.830
put that down, friend?

20:54.830 --> 20:56.957
Friend.

20:56.957 --> 20:59.461
I'm not a friend of the devil.

21:27.685 --> 21:29.783
Okay, Mr. Brady.

21:30.614 --> 21:32.144
Since you're not talking,

21:32.144 --> 21:35.448
I wanna give you sodium amatol
to loosen you up.

21:35.448 --> 21:37.226
Is that okay?

21:38.552 --> 21:41.640
All right, Mr. Brady, let's try this again.

21:41.640 --> 21:44.297
What is your name?

21:46.157 --> 21:48.478
Robert Goren.

21:49.562 --> 21:52.209
William Brady.

21:52.833 --> 21:55.428
Well, which is it?

21:56.793 --> 21:59.741
I'm also Robert Goren.

21:59.741 --> 22:03.194
What is your occupation, Mr. Goren?

22:05.749 --> 22:09.725
I'm a detective in Major Case squad.

22:10.227 --> 22:13.733
- In New York City.
- Major Case?

22:13.733 --> 22:18.076
Well, you're certainly
a long way from home.

22:18.076 --> 22:21.363
You investigating something?

22:26.629 --> 22:27.469
Murder.

22:29.873 --> 22:31.327
Look, I'm sure you believe that,

22:31.327 --> 22:35.768
but, frankly, I have a hard time believing it.

22:35.768 --> 22:38.834
Killing people here.

22:40.646 --> 22:44.116
Tell me how, Detective Goren.

22:46.722 --> 22:48.313
Who?

22:48.313 --> 22:52.953
Detective Goren.
You said you were Detective Goren.

22:58.511 --> 23:01.162
Don't understand the question.

23:01.162 --> 23:05.707
Detective Goren, you said that
they were murdering people here.

23:05.707 --> 23:07.986
Tell me how.

23:07.986 --> 23:14.348
I'm a... history teacher in high school.

23:14.348 --> 23:16.962
William Brady.

23:21.665 --> 23:24.719
Okay, very good, Mr. Brady.

23:24.719 --> 23:27.775
And are they still killing people here?

23:31.015 --> 23:34.161
Why would they do that?

23:40.897 --> 23:42.693
Is that your partner's cell phone?

23:42.693 --> 23:45.649
Uh, yeah. He left it.

23:45.649 --> 23:49.979
He said he didn't want to be
disturbed on his leave.

23:49.979 --> 23:51.792
Tell you where he was going?

23:51.792 --> 23:54.557
Nope. Just somewhere quiet.

24:23.692 --> 24:25.351
I got this.

24:32.390 --> 24:34.140
Hey, big guy.

24:34.925 --> 24:36.956
The food's okay.

24:40.121 --> 24:41.881
See?

24:43.600 --> 24:46.465
So what do they do to people here?

24:47.984 --> 24:50.793
They don't like it here
when you make a mess.

24:57.415 --> 24:59.560
What are they gonna do to me, huh?

24:59.560 --> 25:01.543
Nothing, big guy.

25:01.858 --> 25:05.921
Listen... you like peanut butter crackers?

25:06.473 --> 25:10.151
Come on.
I'll get you some, hmm?

25:14.548 --> 25:16.492
Come on.

25:22.947 --> 25:25.598
Your T-shirt... your eyes followed me.

25:25.598 --> 25:27.723
- Following me.
- No, no.

25:27.723 --> 25:29.947
This T-shirt's okay.

25:29.947 --> 25:32.321
It belongs to my friend.

25:33.685 --> 25:36.629
Where is he?
Where'd he go?

25:36.881 --> 25:39.123
He's in ISO.
Isolation.

25:39.123 --> 25:41.525
Can I see him?

25:43.889 --> 25:47.866
The COs like me.
Let me see what I can do.

25:49.353 --> 25:51.900
Come by my bunk in about an hour.

25:54.873 --> 25:57.312
Hi, sis.

25:58.077 --> 26:01.025
I'm still on my cruise.

26:01.025 --> 26:03.567
I thought I'd see Frank's son, but...

26:03.567 --> 26:08.777
I guess he's, uh...
In a single room below deck.

26:10.301 --> 26:12.116
Okay.

26:24.450 --> 26:25.596
Let me go.

26:25.596 --> 26:27.733
Let me go.
I don't wanna.

26:27.733 --> 26:29.335
Keep a look out for the bulls.
This kid's a...

26:29.335 --> 26:32.203
Let him go.
What are you doing?

26:32.203 --> 26:33.963
You're supposed to do what I say.

26:33.963 --> 26:35.372
That what you do to Donny, huh?

26:35.372 --> 26:37.360
Is that what you do to Donny?
Did you do it to Donny?

26:37.360 --> 26:39.708
They like it, big guy.
I'm like a father to them.

26:39.708 --> 26:41.221
You did it to Donny?

26:41.221 --> 26:42.978
Garvin! Manos!

26:42.978 --> 26:44.691
You like it here, don't you?

26:44.691 --> 26:47.793
All these lost boys, right?
You're not crazy, are you?

26:47.793 --> 26:49.875
You're not crazy, are you?
You're sick.

26:49.875 --> 26:51.069
You're sick.

26:51.069 --> 26:52.271
What about you?

26:52.271 --> 26:54.451
What the hell is going on here?

26:54.451 --> 26:56.239
The big guy just snapped.
Get him tranqued.

26:56.239 --> 26:58.581
- Get him tranqued.
- Let's go.

27:00.044 --> 27:02.903
I'm coming for ya!

27:06.538 --> 27:08.164
Swallow.

27:08.164 --> 27:09.763
I need you to swallow.

27:09.763 --> 27:11.327
You're cheeking them.

27:11.327 --> 27:14.506
Swallow the damn pills.

27:19.804 --> 27:21.584
Okay, now, you listen to me.

27:21.584 --> 27:23.157
The guards already called the warden.

27:23.157 --> 27:27.582
Just take the pills.
I'm here to help you.

27:27.582 --> 27:30.420
If I take these pills,

27:30.420 --> 27:31.834
you'll put batteries in me.

27:31.834 --> 27:35.006
Swallow, or they're gonna
take you to isolation.

27:35.282 --> 27:37.132
Fine. Let them.

27:37.132 --> 27:39.602
No, you don't want that.

27:39.834 --> 27:43.767
Mr. Brady.
Giving my staff a hard time?

27:44.098 --> 27:46.800
The guards tell me this inmate
has been problematic.

27:46.800 --> 27:48.138
It's under control, warden.

27:48.138 --> 27:50.911
It is under control. It's simply
that I don't wanna take my pills.

27:50.911 --> 27:53.315
I've said it a few times,
and nobody seems to be listening to me.

27:53.315 --> 27:54.660
I don't wanna take my pills.

27:54.660 --> 27:56.576
I'm not gonna take them.

27:56.820 --> 27:58.581
- Okay, Mr. Brady, that's...
- Just no more pills.

27:58.581 --> 28:00.890
That's the last time you act out.
You're going downstairs.

28:00.890 --> 28:03.685
I don't think that's necessary.

28:03.685 --> 28:06.439
You're new, doctor.
You're not getting the big picture.

28:06.439 --> 28:10.028
I see an inmate who could
decompensate in isolation.

28:10.028 --> 28:12.075
My staff has to put up with constant abuse.

28:12.075 --> 28:16.523
They get urinated on,
they get blood and feces thrown on them.

28:16.523 --> 28:20.167
These people have to learn restraint.

28:39.661 --> 28:41.301
Bobby?

29:06.302 --> 29:08.203
Relax.

29:08.203 --> 29:10.003
Okay, come on, big man.

29:10.003 --> 29:12.107
- Easy does it, big man.
- It's too hot in here.

29:12.107 --> 29:13.999
Let's get outta here.

29:14.758 --> 29:16.388
It's hot cause we're next to the boiler.

29:16.388 --> 29:19.097
How long do I have to be in here?

29:19.518 --> 29:22.420
You see, that's not up to us.
It's up to you.

29:32.286 --> 29:34.532
- All secure?
- Secure.

30:11.808 --> 30:14.945
Can I get some water, please?

30:23.763 --> 30:26.742
10, 9, 8, 7, 6...

30:26.742 --> 30:30.244
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

30:30.567 --> 30:35.967
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

30:43.357 --> 30:46.198
I need some water!

31:19.397 --> 31:22.546
I keep asking for water.

31:23.979 --> 31:26.959
I been asking for water, please!

31:27.405 --> 31:30.387
I keep asking for water!

31:30.387 --> 31:32.712
Shut up in there!

31:33.045 --> 31:35.652
I keep asking for it.

31:43.309 --> 31:45.133
Here's your water.

31:48.291 --> 31:49.670
Can you get me some more?

31:49.670 --> 31:51.269
Can you believe that?

31:51.269 --> 31:53.962
He spills his water
after all that bitching?

31:53.962 --> 31:57.349
Get me some water.
Please.

31:57.349 --> 31:59.450
You spilled it all.

32:00.791 --> 32:03.774
You spilled it all over.

32:05.249 --> 32:07.513
You spilled it!

32:11.817 --> 32:15.306
I'll take my pills.
Just get me outta here.

32:15.958 --> 32:19.315
I'll take the pills.
Just get me out.

32:53.469 --> 32:54.789
10, 9, 8...

33:21.486 --> 33:23.213
Bobby!

34:03.696 --> 34:05.402
Captain?

34:06.540 --> 34:09.746
Overture begins at 7:00, Eames.
I got a half hour to get to Lincoln Center.

34:09.746 --> 34:11.821
It's about Goren.

34:12.641 --> 34:14.735
Talk to me on the way down.

34:17.447 --> 34:18.746
What?

34:19.391 --> 34:21.271
How many hours have passed
since he should have called?

34:21.271 --> 34:22.460
Five.

34:22.460 --> 34:26.335
You let your partner go on a rogue mission
in a prison mental unit?

34:26.335 --> 34:28.936
- Eames, where did your judgment go?
- All due respect,

34:28.936 --> 34:32.389
What did you think would happen
when you sent Donny back up there?

34:32.389 --> 34:34.385
You mean when I didn't rewrite
the entire penal code

34:34.385 --> 34:37.791
for one detective trying
to stash his nephew?

34:37.791 --> 34:40.009
Eames, we did everything
we could for Donny.

34:40.009 --> 34:41.716
Goren saw it differently.
He thought...

34:41.716 --> 34:45.541
Eames... be very careful here.

34:47.107 --> 34:49.996
That your hands were tied.

34:50.507 --> 34:52.007
So what do we do now?

34:52.007 --> 34:54.431
Do we go to the DA, the chief of Ds?

34:54.431 --> 34:56.330
Absolutely not.

34:56.330 --> 34:59.729
Then I head up there myself.
I'll drive all night. / No.

34:59.729 --> 35:01.542
We go together.

35:01.890 --> 35:03.419
Now.

35:06.456 --> 35:08.029
All right, Brady.

35:08.029 --> 35:10.370
Come on. Back to heaven.

35:10.370 --> 35:13.275
- No.
- Wells, Altin.

35:14.341 --> 35:17.345
- Let's get our friend up here.
- Water. Food.

35:19.419 --> 35:21.479
- Hey, I'm a cop, bud.
- Yeah.

35:21.479 --> 35:24.106
Yeah. Me too.

35:24.439 --> 35:27.240
This is not fair.
It's too long.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.857
Not good.
It's too long.

35:30.857 --> 35:32.763
- No.
- Let's go.

35:32.763 --> 35:35.556
No! It's too long!
It's not fair!

35:35.556 --> 35:37.321
Yeah.

35:43.128 --> 35:46.585
How come his prints didn't show
in the system when they arrested him?

35:46.585 --> 35:49.400
He took care of that and
created an alias.

35:49.400 --> 35:51.157
On his own?

35:51.157 --> 35:53.614
How many people in MCS
are involved in this?

35:53.614 --> 35:55.707
Counting you and me?

35:58.591 --> 35:59.837
How long has he been like this?

35:59.837 --> 36:01.307
I don't now.

36:02.159 --> 36:03.830
I think his appendix burst.

36:03.830 --> 36:07.285
You want another accident like last time?
He needs to get to a hospital now.

36:07.285 --> 36:09.009
All right, come up.

36:13.636 --> 36:15.954
What did he think
he could do up here?

36:15.954 --> 36:18.956
Was he just trying to get
as close to the edge as he could?

36:18.956 --> 36:23.286
All he was thinking
was he had to save Donny.

36:29.852 --> 36:33.171
I'm gonna arrest you.
I'm gonna arrest all of you.

36:34.401 --> 36:37.064
I'm gonna arrest the whole prison,
arrest the whole world.

36:37.064 --> 36:38.692
You're gonna arrest us?

36:38.692 --> 36:40.694
- How you gonna do that?
- I'm a cop.

36:40.694 --> 36:42.913
My badge number's...

36:44.623 --> 36:47.458
My badge number is...

36:47.735 --> 36:49.478
8...

36:50.216 --> 36:53.554
8. That's crazy 8.

36:53.554 --> 36:57.765
I killed Dillinger.
Bang, bang, bang.

36:57.765 --> 37:00.011
I'm a space cop from a spaceship.

37:00.011 --> 37:02.614
And I found Jimmy Hoffa.

37:06.775 --> 37:08.524
Bang.

37:11.167 --> 37:12.962
Bang.

37:18.061 --> 37:19.949
Bang.

37:25.638 --> 37:27.455
- Secure?
- Secure.

37:35.515 --> 37:38.277
I understand you've left her messages.
Can she be paged?

37:38.277 --> 37:40.579
No. A prisoner's escaped.

37:40.579 --> 37:43.596
We thought he had appendicitis,
so we took him to the hospital...

37:43.596 --> 37:44.852
Good morning.

37:44.852 --> 37:47.766
I'm warden Pellis.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.684
You've come a long way.

37:50.638 --> 37:55.548
So our inmate William Brady, you're
saying his real name is Robert Goren?

37:55.548 --> 37:59.455
Yes. He's one of my detectives
in the Major Case squad.

38:00.925 --> 38:02.443
How did you know he was here?

38:02.443 --> 38:06.991
His brother called us,
said Goren had some kind of breakdown,

38:06.991 --> 38:09.632
that he's been here several days.

38:09.632 --> 38:12.117
This Goren's on active duty?

38:12.117 --> 38:14.480
That didn't show up
when the police processed him.

38:14.480 --> 38:18.300
He recently altered his prints
for an undercover operation.

38:18.300 --> 38:20.355
Really?

38:20.787 --> 38:24.325
Well, by the time he was brought to us,
he was catatonic.

38:24.325 --> 38:29.283
The psychiatrist diagnosed him
as schizophrenic.

38:29.283 --> 38:32.146
Psychiatrists make mistakes.

38:32.146 --> 38:36.454
Good wardens correct them
before the IG finds out.

38:36.809 --> 38:39.882
That almost sounds like
a threat, Captain.

38:40.111 --> 38:43.862
This Detective is very important to NYPD.

39:04.880 --> 39:07.555
And I was able to confirm

39:07.555 --> 39:15.452
that inmates were subjected to
punitive use of top of bed restraints

39:15.452 --> 39:20.560
for up to 18 hours without food or water.

39:20.560 --> 39:26.603
At least one inmate, Jay Lowry,

39:26.603 --> 39:32.373
died as a result of this torture.

39:33.071 --> 39:40.310
And while my investigation was
unauthorized...

39:40.310 --> 39:46.217
I feel it was the only way to...
uncover the truth.

39:48.884 --> 39:50.960
Thank you for your statement, Detective.

39:50.960 --> 39:52.141
Yes, sir.

39:52.141 --> 39:55.505
Now, Detective,

39:55.505 --> 39:59.181
would you like to tell me
who the hell you think you are?

39:59.181 --> 40:02.232
You thought you were gonna get
an "Atta Boy" out of this?

40:02.232 --> 40:05.504
You misrepresented yourself
in a state prison,

40:05.504 --> 40:08.652
involved your partner and your captain
as unwitting accomplices

40:08.652 --> 40:12.640
in discrediting ways that shall be duly
noted in their jackets.

40:12.640 --> 40:17.552
And you provoked an already overburdened
MO unit to forcibly restrain you.

40:17.552 --> 40:18.738
If you ask me...

40:18.738 --> 40:24.573
You think that I wasn't play insane,
that I am insane.

40:24.573 --> 40:27.565
You ever asked yourself that question?

40:29.474 --> 40:31.344
Yes, sir.

40:31.344 --> 40:35.979
And I believe asking the question
proves that I am sane.

40:36.562 --> 40:43.203
And that I was willing to take
my investigation to the end of the line.

40:47.711 --> 40:53.385
warden Pellis and Tates MO will be
investigated by the proper authorities.

40:53.385 --> 40:57.757
Meanwhile, pending a departmental
hearing and a psychological evaluation,

40:57.757 --> 41:00.477
you are suspended.

41:13.486 --> 41:16.805
I'm a cop, okay?
When I call, you answer.

41:16.805 --> 41:19.459
Okay? Now, where is he?

41:20.272 --> 41:22.236
Where is Donny?

41:22.236 --> 41:24.109
I... look, man, I got neighbors.
Just take it easy.

41:24.109 --> 41:26.343
Your neighbors?
You care about your neighbors right now

41:26.343 --> 41:27.743
when your son is out there somewhere?

41:27.743 --> 41:30.244
He called me.
He's all right.

41:30.244 --> 41:31.878
He only escaped 'cause
he wanted to save your ass.

41:31.878 --> 41:33.447
What... what you you mean?

41:33.447 --> 41:35.305
What do you mean, you knew?
You knew?

41:35.305 --> 41:38.317
- You knew that I was...
- Get your hands off me, all right?

41:39.612 --> 41:41.452
Just...

41:41.728 --> 41:44.547
Donny was doing fine up there
without you stomping around.

41:44.547 --> 41:46.526
Just you know what?

41:46.943 --> 41:49.127
Just take Eames to a motel
and get it out of your system.

41:49.127 --> 41:51.611
- What? What?
- Stop. Stop.

41:53.113 --> 41:55.090
You tell me how I can reach Donny.

41:55.090 --> 41:57.221
I don't know.
He calls me from pay phones.

41:57.221 --> 41:59.109
Okay, so what do you hear
when he calls?

41:59.109 --> 42:02.796
Do you hear city sounds,
you know, sirens?

42:03.290 --> 42:07.415
I don't know.
Who pays attention to that?

42:10.715 --> 42:15.025
Why didn't you call me
when Donny was arrested?

42:15.025 --> 42:16.873
I already told you, man.
It was tough love.

42:16.873 --> 42:20.538
No, you were trying to save that favor,

42:20.538 --> 42:23.195
because you knew
it was just a matter of time

42:23.195 --> 42:26.512
when you could call in
that favor for yourself.

42:26.512 --> 42:28.594
From my... from you...

42:28.594 --> 42:31.559
What have you done for me, Bobby?

42:31.559 --> 42:33.330
What have you done for me?
You gave me a coat?

42:33.330 --> 42:36.130
You slip me a couple of bucks
so you can feel good about yourself?

42:36.130 --> 42:37.721
Well, guess what.
I don't need that.

42:37.721 --> 42:40.770
- Neither does Donny.
- Donny's smart, Frank.

42:40.770 --> 42:42.013
He doesn't need you.

42:42.013 --> 42:44.028
I'm smart!

42:44.238 --> 42:46.314
I'm smart!
You forget!

42:46.314 --> 42:48.529
Everyone in this family forgets!

42:48.529 --> 42:50.750
I was the one.

42:55.904 --> 42:57.847
Look, we both caught a raw deal, okay?

42:57.847 --> 42:59.760
Could have brought us
closer together, but this is it.

42:59.760 --> 43:01.773
This is us, you know?

43:02.897 --> 43:06.266
You don't wanna be my brother.

43:08.752 --> 43:09.814
Just get the hell outta here.

43:09.814 --> 43:11.831
No. Not till you tell me how to reach Donny.

43:11.831 --> 43:13.676
He just wants your money, like me.

43:13.676 --> 43:14.845
Ah, you...

43:16.726 --> 43:18.188
Tell me.

43:18.423 --> 43:19.618
Think!

43:19.618 --> 43:21.125
Think hard!

43:21.125 --> 43:23.111
What did you hear in the background?

43:23.111 --> 43:25.445
I don't know.
It was late.

43:25.445 --> 43:28.033
- It was like 4:00 am.
- What did you hear?

43:28.033 --> 43:31.427
Video games or something
in the background.

43:35.647 --> 43:39.397
All right.
So could be Times Square.

43:40.283 --> 43:43.705
All right.
I need your, uh, cell phone.

43:43.705 --> 43:45.927
- Give it to me.
- Why?

43:46.385 --> 43:48.748
Wait a minute.
Not there. No...

43:50.560 --> 43:53.584
- What is this?
- Give it... give it... Just give it to me.

43:59.871 --> 44:02.321
I'm done with you.
You...

44:03.474 --> 44:08.060
You can't contact me anymore ever again.
You understand?

44:09.034 --> 44:14.519
If I hear that you're on the bridge,
ready to jump,

44:14.519 --> 44:18.243
you know, I'll...
I'll listen for the splash.
