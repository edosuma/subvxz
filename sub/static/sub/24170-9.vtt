WEBVTT

00:02.100 --> 00:03.455
We know each other.

00:03.480 --> 00:05.047
- Grant.
- Yes! Travis.

00:05.081 --> 00:06.248
I remember.

00:06.283 --> 00:08.484
That woman does not slow down.

00:08.518 --> 00:09.752
Are you good to work today?

00:09.786 --> 00:11.320
I wouldn't be here if I weren't.

00:11.354 --> 00:12.788
Who was proctoring the test?

00:12.822 --> 00:14.790
- The fire chief.
- Ripley.

00:14.824 --> 00:16.325
Not an easy man to impress.

00:16.359 --> 00:18.227
If a lieutenant spot opens up
at the end of all this,

00:18.261 --> 00:20.729
I expect you to throw your hat
in the ring.

00:20.764 --> 00:22.932
Who do you recommend
to be the new captain...

00:22.966 --> 00:25.267
Herrera or Gibson?

00:25.302 --> 00:26.435
Neither one.

00:28.305 --> 00:30.906
Flames aren't
the deadliest part of a fire.

00:30.941 --> 00:32.674
It's the heat.

00:32.709 --> 00:34.743
Radiant heat alone can singe paper,

00:34.778 --> 00:36.679
melt plastic, blister flesh.

00:36.713 --> 00:38.382
- What are you doing?!
- Aah! Okay, got it.

00:38.407 --> 00:40.021
- What are you doing?!
- Aah! Oh!

00:40.055 --> 00:41.750
- Sorry.
- What?

00:41.785 --> 00:43.152
Got it.

00:44.287 --> 00:45.654
You're burning our wedding photos?

00:45.689 --> 00:47.423
I was having a moment.

00:47.771 --> 00:49.305
Seems like a lifetime ago.

00:49.339 --> 00:50.773
I can't believe we're getting divorced.

00:50.807 --> 00:52.208
Yeah, me either.

00:53.877 --> 00:55.411
Wait. Oh, wait.

00:55.445 --> 00:58.147
Did you put our unity hands
in the fireplace, too?

00:58.181 --> 00:59.849
Look, I said I was having a moment.

00:59.883 --> 01:03.853
Well, you can't just go reducing
all our memories to ashes!

01:03.887 --> 01:05.421
What else did you put in there?

01:05.455 --> 01:06.422
You know what? I'm gonna
go check the rest of the house.

01:06.456 --> 01:08.791
Nothing! No. Okay,
you're being very dramatic.

01:08.825 --> 01:11.093
You know, I'm the one who just
burned my fingers, by the way.

01:11.128 --> 01:13.696
I think that's something
most people don't realize.

01:13.730 --> 01:15.598
If the heat index is high enough,

01:15.632 --> 01:17.199
it'll get the job done.

01:17.234 --> 01:19.855
You don't even have to touch the fire...

01:21.071 --> 01:22.171
for it to burn you.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.074

01:31.982 --> 01:33.724
It's dawn, and we're just getting home...

01:33.758 --> 01:35.351
and I can't keep doing this.

01:35.385 --> 01:37.186
You stay up all night all the time.

01:37.220 --> 01:39.956
Yeah, to put out fires,
not to go to concerts.

01:39.990 --> 01:42.959
And to eat ramen
and to watch the sunrise.

01:42.993 --> 01:44.727
I mean, I wouldn't have a job
reviewing music if I didn't,

01:44.761 --> 01:46.896
you know, actually see the bands perform.

01:46.930 --> 01:49.198
That ramen was delicious.

01:49.232 --> 01:51.400
Well, to be fair, everything
tastes great at 4:00 a.m.

01:55.706 --> 01:58.341
I have an hour...

01:58.375 --> 02:00.810
one hour left
before I have to get to work.

02:00.844 --> 02:03.479
Well, if that's all the time
we have left together,

02:03.513 --> 02:05.848
seems like such a shame
to waste it on sleep.

02:11.221 --> 02:12.356
Oh.

02:13.724 --> 02:15.925
Have you talked to my dad lately?

02:15.959 --> 02:18.027
Has he seemed quiet to you?

02:18.061 --> 02:20.196
Your dad's always quiet
with me... or grumpy.

02:20.230 --> 02:21.415
There's not much else in between.

02:21.449 --> 02:24.500
In the last couple days,
he's barely said a word.

02:24.534 --> 02:25.701
You think it's the chemo?

02:25.736 --> 02:27.069
Maybe.

02:27.104 --> 02:28.340
Probably.

02:29.072 --> 02:31.040
You're right, it's probably that.

02:31.074 --> 02:32.174
- Race you to the tree?
- Hey!

02:33.910 --> 02:35.678
Aah.

02:35.712 --> 02:36.946
Whoo!

02:36.980 --> 02:39.115
Best two out of three?

02:39.149 --> 02:41.017
Someone's a glutton for punishment.

02:43.320 --> 02:45.254
Mm.

02:45.288 --> 02:47.289
Mm.

02:49.559 --> 02:54.263
Mm. You... are very good, Ryan Tanner.

02:54.297 --> 02:55.765
But I'm not going to let you win.

02:55.799 --> 02:57.333
Oh, I'm counting on that.

02:58.301 --> 03:00.622
- Whoa.
- This is for you.

03:01.438 --> 03:03.773
One for me.

03:03.807 --> 03:05.307
Huh.

03:05.342 --> 03:08.577
Best thing you ever tasted... you'll see.

03:08.612 --> 03:11.080
All right. There you go.

03:11.114 --> 03:13.215
Oh, slow down.

03:13.250 --> 03:14.784
It still needs a little time.

03:14.818 --> 03:17.586
The heat from the jar
is cooking the eggs.

03:20.757 --> 03:23.159
Okay. Try it.

03:28.098 --> 03:29.609
Well?

03:30.300 --> 03:31.734
It's the best thing I've ever tasted.

03:32.869 --> 03:34.670
Wow.

03:34.704 --> 03:36.272
You didn't have to go
to all this trouble.

03:36.306 --> 03:38.368
I would have been fine
with the Waffle House.

03:39.209 --> 03:41.277
Just wait till you see
what I cook you for dinner.

03:44.681 --> 03:50.019
Um, so if we're gonna
try this, really try this,

03:50.053 --> 03:51.821
I need to go slow.

03:53.223 --> 03:55.825
- I know.
- I mean, like, glacially slow.

03:56.595 --> 03:59.028
I-I have to ease back into this.

03:59.062 --> 04:02.331
I may need to pause,
I may not call you right away,

04:02.365 --> 04:04.366
and if that's gonna make it
weird for you...

04:04.401 --> 04:05.668
It won't.

04:05.702 --> 04:07.169
You don't know that.

04:09.239 --> 04:13.209
I cooked these eggs
at 140 degrees for 45 minutes.

04:13.243 --> 04:15.377
I could have done a 6-minute rapid boil.

04:15.412 --> 04:16.478
You know why I didn't?

04:16.512 --> 04:17.512
I don't.

04:17.547 --> 04:22.318
Because I know when something's
worth the wait.

04:37.501 --> 04:38.834
How's that nap going?

04:38.869 --> 04:40.536
Nah. It was no nap.

04:40.570 --> 04:42.338
It's, uh, meditation.

04:42.372 --> 04:43.639
Travis taught me.

04:43.673 --> 04:44.573
Mm-hmm.

04:44.608 --> 04:45.841
It's true.

04:45.876 --> 04:48.377
I learned the downward puppy thing

04:48.411 --> 04:52.414
and the sad baby and the happy baby pose.

04:52.449 --> 04:55.017
Yeah, I'm pretty sure some
of those aren't real, but okay.

04:55.051 --> 04:57.052
Look, I'm about to go get
started washing the barn.

04:57.087 --> 04:58.487
You want to help?

04:58.522 --> 04:59.889
Yeah. Absolutely, man.

04:59.923 --> 05:01.657
I'll... I'll be right there.

05:09.466 --> 05:11.333
I don't want to get you guys too excited,

05:11.368 --> 05:13.402
but Jack and I just approved

05:13.436 --> 05:16.038
some seriously badass new gadgets.

05:16.072 --> 05:18.874
Can you believe that,
in a couple of days,

05:18.909 --> 05:20.509
the Captain's race will be over?

05:20.544 --> 05:22.411
And then it'll just be you

05:22.445 --> 05:23.913
approving all the new gadgets.

05:23.947 --> 05:26.415
Ah! We'll see.
I mean, nothing's for sure.

05:26.449 --> 05:28.384
We don't know
who's gonna be named Captain.

05:28.418 --> 05:30.186
The Incinerator really counts against me.

05:30.220 --> 05:31.921
Your track record counts, too.

05:31.955 --> 05:33.556
And your stats, the station's stats.

05:33.590 --> 05:35.391
Well, not to mention Jack and I
still have to go

05:35.425 --> 05:37.426
before the board and Ripley
for our sit-downs.

05:37.460 --> 05:38.594
Ripley.

05:38.628 --> 05:41.797
Did I tell you what he said
to me during peer reviews?

05:41.831 --> 05:43.766
That I should go out for lieutenant

05:43.800 --> 05:46.402
because he thought I would make
a good Captain, too, someday?

05:46.436 --> 05:48.037
As if he should be focused on that.

05:48.071 --> 05:49.405
Yeah, well, he was mainly just focused

05:49.439 --> 05:50.906
on kicking me out of the room.

05:50.941 --> 05:52.741
So, maybe don't remind him
that you know me

05:52.776 --> 05:54.276
when you go for your sit-down.

05:54.311 --> 05:55.492
It'll probably be better for you.

05:55.526 --> 05:58.147
Maya, you should go out for lieutenant...

05:58.181 --> 05:59.615
whether I win or not.

05:59.649 --> 06:03.452
First things first...
Let's make you a Captain.

06:03.486 --> 06:05.054
Come on.

06:06.489 --> 06:07.790
Hey.

06:07.824 --> 06:09.892
How's the new chemo going, sir?

06:09.926 --> 06:12.428
Your white blood cell counts,
your platelets?

06:12.462 --> 06:14.496
Uh, according to your wife,
I'm responding nicely.

06:14.531 --> 06:16.232
Oh, so you're feeling better, stronger?

06:16.266 --> 06:17.366
I suppose.

06:17.400 --> 06:20.363
That's great,
'cause I got a bone to pick.

06:21.104 --> 06:23.439
You outed me to my wife

06:23.473 --> 06:25.941
about all the dangerous things
I've been doing on this job,

06:25.976 --> 06:27.843
and now she thinks that
I'm keeping things from her.

06:27.877 --> 06:29.144
You're coming at me right now?

06:29.179 --> 06:30.946
I'm ill, Warren.

06:32.482 --> 06:34.016
You're playing the cancer card.

06:34.050 --> 06:35.117
You must be feeling better.

06:35.151 --> 06:37.853
I'm just saying you shouldn't
keep things from family.

06:37.887 --> 06:40.489
Sure, okay, 'cause you've been
so honest with yours.

06:44.561 --> 06:47.529
When you told your wife about all this,

06:47.564 --> 06:50.332
that you wanted to change
careers, how'd that go?

06:50.367 --> 06:53.302
Uh... Um...

06:53.336 --> 06:56.171
Look, I knew that this was
the right thing for me.

06:56.206 --> 06:57.417
I was confident in that,

06:57.452 --> 06:59.842
but I didn't know how she would take it.

06:59.876 --> 07:01.977
You know, I mean,
there was this huge thing

07:02.012 --> 07:04.480
that didn't just affect me...
it affected her.

07:04.514 --> 07:05.881
I was worried, and I didn't know

07:05.915 --> 07:07.783
if she would see it the way I did.

07:07.817 --> 07:10.786
But I knew I had to tell her.

07:10.820 --> 07:13.555
It was one of the hardest things
I ever had to do,

07:13.590 --> 07:14.657
like, in my life,

07:14.691 --> 07:17.493
which, considering, says a lot.

07:22.165 --> 07:24.199
You sure you're all right, sir?

07:24.234 --> 07:25.720
Yeah, I'm sure.

07:27.070 --> 07:28.570
You missed a spot.

07:38.281 --> 07:39.682
The day's young...

07:39.716 --> 07:41.817
don't wear yourself out
before it's started.

07:41.851 --> 07:43.385
I'm not.

07:43.420 --> 07:45.587
If anything, I've got too much energy.

07:45.622 --> 07:47.656
I don't know what it is.

07:47.691 --> 07:49.858
I'm just... I don't know... I'm bursting.

07:49.893 --> 07:51.327
I went for a run earlier,

07:51.361 --> 07:52.728
and I feel like
that only got me more amped.

07:52.762 --> 07:53.929
It's the Captain's race.

07:53.963 --> 07:55.531
It's because it's almost over.

07:55.565 --> 07:57.366
Eh, maybe.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.535
You were like this
every single birthday, too...

07:59.569 --> 08:01.437
couldn't get you to sleep
for a week before it.

08:01.471 --> 08:03.505
Still that way.

08:03.540 --> 08:06.241
I want you to be careful
about getting your hopes up.

08:06.276 --> 08:07.409
If you build it up too much,

08:07.444 --> 08:08.844
it'll be that much more difficult

08:08.878 --> 08:10.879
if you don't get the Captain's position.

08:10.914 --> 08:14.083
I know. I can handle it.

08:14.117 --> 08:16.518
You say that and you talk a great game,

08:16.553 --> 08:18.220
but I know you, m'ija.

08:18.254 --> 08:19.355
I know how you get.

08:19.389 --> 08:21.857
Dad, I'm a big girl.

08:21.891 --> 08:26.795
Whatever the board decides,
I can handle it, promise.

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

08:49.786 --> 08:51.720
I can't believe you called the police.

08:51.755 --> 08:53.589
Yeah, I can't believe
that you would resort to theft.

08:53.623 --> 08:55.224
Okay, let's just calm down.

08:55.258 --> 08:57.126
What were you saying again about
your wife starting the fire?

08:57.160 --> 08:59.328
Um, ex-wife... to-be...
and, no, I didn't.

08:59.362 --> 09:01.230
She decided to burn all my stuff.

09:01.264 --> 09:04.133
Not all of it... some, you know,
like the really bad stuff,

09:04.167 --> 09:06.101
like his leather pants.

09:06.136 --> 09:07.336
Tanner, what do you know?

09:07.370 --> 09:08.504
Items were burning in a fireplace

09:08.538 --> 09:10.723
at the back of the house... seems
like the fire sprung up in there.

09:10.757 --> 09:12.574
Looks pretty contained
from what we've seen so far.

09:12.609 --> 09:13.742
No one else is in the house.

09:13.777 --> 09:15.844
Can I get a copy of the report
for insurance purposes?

09:15.879 --> 09:17.279
I've been through the house,

09:17.313 --> 09:18.814
and there are items definitely missing.

09:18.848 --> 09:20.649
Oh, okay, and you call me paranoid.

09:20.683 --> 09:23.652
You installed a thumbprint
to get in and out of the garage.

09:23.686 --> 09:24.730
I'm not even allowed in there.

09:24.764 --> 09:26.088
Oh, my God, Oliver!

09:26.122 --> 09:28.257
His stuff is fine. I will prove it.

09:28.291 --> 09:29.625
Uh, maybe don't go toward
the house that's on fire.

09:29.659 --> 09:31.160
It's nowhere near the garage.

09:31.194 --> 09:33.695
Fireplace origin,
moved to interior walls.

09:33.730 --> 09:34.817
Chimney's the only vent.
Do you want to stuff it?

09:34.852 --> 09:36.131
Hell, yeah, I want to stuff it.

09:36.166 --> 09:37.266
I'm sorry, stuff what?

09:37.300 --> 09:38.500
- The turkey.
- The turkey.

09:38.535 --> 09:40.102
Yeah, that didn't clear anything up.

09:40.136 --> 09:41.670
It's one of Captain Pruitt's
favorite plays...

09:41.704 --> 09:42.771
You get an interior fire like this,

09:42.806 --> 09:43.771
helps to hit it two ways.

09:43.805 --> 09:45.007
You soak the outside first,

09:45.041 --> 09:46.141
seal the flame inside.

09:46.176 --> 09:47.075
Yeah, it's like basting.

09:47.110 --> 09:49.211
Then we also hit it hard
from the inside...

09:49.245 --> 09:50.612
Only way that works, though...

09:50.647 --> 09:51.980
if you have deep-pocket access,

09:52.015 --> 09:54.483
which we do, though that garage.

09:54.517 --> 09:55.717
That way, you can go in the middle

09:55.752 --> 09:57.152
without getting cooked yourself.

09:57.187 --> 09:58.320
That actually made sense.

09:58.354 --> 09:59.221
If we go through the garage,

09:59.255 --> 10:00.889
that fire will be out in half the time.

10:00.924 --> 10:02.324
Is it weird that I'm not hungry?

10:02.358 --> 10:03.659
Time to stuff the turkey, guys.

10:03.693 --> 10:04.860
That means everybody's splitting up.

10:04.894 --> 10:06.228
Keep your radios on 3.

10:06.262 --> 10:08.697
I want to hear every step. Let's move.

10:08.731 --> 10:10.632
There. See?

10:10.667 --> 10:12.835
I didn't steal any
of his precious keepsakes,

10:12.869 --> 10:14.870
which, by the way,
were our precious keepsakes

10:14.904 --> 10:16.638
until three days ago.

10:16.673 --> 10:18.640
Hey, ma'am, ma'am,
we need you to open this door

10:18.675 --> 10:20.242
so we can get access
to this part of your house.

10:20.276 --> 10:21.376
Is it locked?

10:21.411 --> 10:23.545
Oh, yes, but I have the key.

10:23.580 --> 10:27.149
It's a biometric lock
that unlocks with my thumbprint.

10:29.085 --> 10:31.086
Huh. That's weird.

10:31.120 --> 10:32.588
That never happens...

10:32.622 --> 10:34.723
Ohh, it looks like
you've blistered your fingers.

10:34.757 --> 10:36.425
They're not too bad,
but the skin's coming off.

10:36.459 --> 10:37.759
I doubt it can read her prints.

10:37.794 --> 10:38.803
You got an override code?

10:38.837 --> 10:40.062
Uh, yes. The panel's in the foyer...

10:40.096 --> 10:41.763
0302.

10:41.798 --> 10:42.931
Month and year of our wedding.

10:42.966 --> 10:46.368
- Dean.
- Yeah... 0302. On it.

10:49.606 --> 10:50.906
All right.

10:50.940 --> 10:52.594
Okay, here we go.

10:53.776 --> 10:55.177
Damn it.

10:56.546 --> 10:57.946
Gibson, can you repeat the passcode?

10:57.981 --> 10:59.915
Is it 0203 or 0302?

11:03.219 --> 11:04.620
He must have found the panel by now.

11:04.654 --> 11:06.788
The light should be turning green.

11:06.823 --> 11:08.651
Dean, what's the holdup?

11:09.659 --> 11:11.026
Miller, do you copy?

11:11.060 --> 11:12.528
Okay, make sure he puts
the code in right,

11:12.562 --> 11:14.029
because if he enters
it incorrectly more than once,

11:14.063 --> 11:15.764
the system goes on lockdown.

11:21.638 --> 11:24.640
Gibson, what's the passcode again?

11:24.674 --> 11:26.742
Repeat... Jack, what is the code?

11:26.776 --> 11:28.477
Is it 0-what-0-what?

11:28.511 --> 11:29.839
What's the right order?

11:30.647 --> 11:32.648
Miller, respond.

11:32.682 --> 11:34.552
Gibson, do you copy?

11:39.255 --> 11:40.489
Okay.

11:40.523 --> 11:42.157
Focus.

11:44.360 --> 11:45.827
0... 2...

11:45.862 --> 11:47.429
Okay, something's wrong.

11:47.463 --> 11:49.064
Bishop, get in there
and figure out what's going on.

11:49.098 --> 11:50.566
...0... 3.

11:53.970 --> 11:55.504
No, no, no, no, no!

11:57.301 --> 12:00.364
Damn it! Nothing.

12:00.389 --> 12:02.056
That's not surprising.

12:02.091 --> 12:04.358
I built this place to be a fortress.

12:04.393 --> 12:07.335
The doors and the walls are all
actually reinforced steel.

12:08.030 --> 12:09.864
I work in cybersecurities,
and I've got a lot

12:09.898 --> 12:11.566
of personal intel stored in there.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.067
Jack, what's going on in there?

12:13.102 --> 12:14.202
Why'd you close the door?

12:14.236 --> 12:15.236
I didn't.

12:15.270 --> 12:17.538
Is there some sort
of override for the system?

12:17.573 --> 12:19.373
Not after it goes into lockdown.

12:19.408 --> 12:20.374
It's like your cellphone

12:20.409 --> 12:22.910
when you mess up the password
a few times...

12:22.945 --> 12:25.379
It won't work again for a few hours.

12:25.414 --> 12:26.914
The alarm will alert the security company

12:26.949 --> 12:28.182
to unlock the doors, right?

12:28.217 --> 12:29.484
Actually, no.

12:29.518 --> 12:31.651
I designed an independent system.

12:32.421 --> 12:33.754
You'd be surprised how untrustworthy

12:33.789 --> 12:36.155
those home security companies are.

12:36.758 --> 12:37.992
Okay, great.

12:38.026 --> 12:39.494
So, correct me if I'm mistaken,

12:39.528 --> 12:42.563
but it seems like we are stuck
in an impenetrable box

12:42.598 --> 12:45.133
with fire spreading toward it right now.

12:45.901 --> 12:47.301
Not how I thought this day would go.

12:47.336 --> 12:49.331
Montgomery, what's the status

12:49.356 --> 12:50.571
of the fire inside?

12:50.606 --> 12:52.940
Don't worry, we got you covered.

12:52.975 --> 12:54.142
Call for backup.

12:54.176 --> 12:56.444
Help me get all the chainsaws
and unload them right now.

12:56.478 --> 12:58.346
Gibson? Gibson, do you read me?

12:58.380 --> 12:59.680
Hey, hey!

12:59.715 --> 13:00.615
What the hell have you been doing?

13:00.649 --> 13:01.749
Why haven't you been
answering your radio?

13:01.783 --> 13:02.717
What are you talking about?

13:02.751 --> 13:04.285
I've been trying to get Jack
this whole time.

13:04.319 --> 13:05.786
Nobody's answering me.

13:05.821 --> 13:07.955
You set your com to Channel 3
like Gibson said, right?

13:10.058 --> 13:11.559
Oh, come on, Miller. What the hell?

13:11.593 --> 13:12.630
I-It's fine, all right? I'm on it.

13:12.665 --> 13:14.061
No, it is not fine!

13:14.096 --> 13:15.796
You punched the wrong code
into the security system,

13:15.831 --> 13:17.131
and it automatically shut all the doors.

13:17.166 --> 13:18.533
Yeah, can't we just override the system?

13:18.567 --> 13:21.035
No. Everybody in there is trapped.

13:27.142 --> 13:29.243
Don't worry... we've got
a team on the fire inside,

13:29.278 --> 13:30.578
and we're trying
to cut through these doors,

13:30.612 --> 13:31.626
but this could take a while.

13:31.661 --> 13:32.880
You guys better get comfortable.

13:32.915 --> 13:34.482
Copy.

13:34.516 --> 13:35.783
More than a beat, I'd guess.

13:35.817 --> 13:38.419
Okay, well, let's see if there's
anything we can do on our end...

13:38.453 --> 13:40.588
any weaknesses, anything.

13:40.622 --> 13:41.756
So, on a sliding scale of worries,

13:41.790 --> 13:44.392
is this a "throw your baby
to me right now" kind of worry?

13:44.426 --> 13:46.661
It's a waiting game right now.

13:46.695 --> 13:48.329
We got to get the right tools out there.

13:48.363 --> 13:49.997
But Montgomery will get us out

13:50.032 --> 13:51.599
unless we figure a way out first.

13:51.633 --> 13:53.167
This garage seems to be air-conditioned,

13:53.202 --> 13:54.602
but the override shut that off, too.

13:54.636 --> 13:55.803
Yeah.

13:55.837 --> 13:58.072
The walls are solid... no help there.

13:58.106 --> 14:00.408
When did those two
become laughing buddies?

14:00.442 --> 14:01.943
Uh, strip mall, maybe?

14:01.977 --> 14:03.611
We need to get some air flowing in here.

14:03.645 --> 14:04.598
It's getting stuffy.

14:04.633 --> 14:06.147
I mean, it seems a little weird, right?

14:06.181 --> 14:07.682
I mean, I've seen weirder.

14:07.716 --> 14:09.450
Audrey, where are your power tools?

14:09.484 --> 14:11.485
Maybe we can weaken the door
mechanism from the inside.

14:11.520 --> 14:13.588
Uh, no power tools...

14:13.622 --> 14:14.855
not really that kind of garage.

14:14.890 --> 14:16.324
- Mm.
- Of course not.

14:16.358 --> 14:19.460
Although I think I did have a toolkit...

14:19.494 --> 14:21.662
maybe in one of these.

14:23.665 --> 14:25.499
Ah!

14:30.806 --> 14:32.607
I'm finding nothing we can use...

14:32.641 --> 14:34.508
light bulbs, extensions cords.

14:34.543 --> 14:36.143
Yeah, rags, funnels...

14:38.413 --> 14:39.457
Oh, photos.

14:39.491 --> 14:41.048
How's it looking out there, Montgomery?

14:41.083 --> 14:42.516
We're still trying to contain the fire,

14:42.551 --> 14:43.618
but we're getting
the Jaws of Life into place

14:43.652 --> 14:44.619
right now.

14:44.653 --> 14:46.721
They were such cute,
little science-y nerds.

14:46.755 --> 14:48.556
- I wonder why they're splitting up.
- I don't know.

14:48.590 --> 14:52.460
She seems awfully good
at... shutting people out.

14:53.762 --> 14:56.230
I got to tell Jack. About Ryan.

14:56.265 --> 14:59.533
I mean, not right now, but soon.
He deserves to know.

14:59.568 --> 15:02.003
And I don't want to rub anything
in his face once I'm Captain.

15:02.037 --> 15:03.838
That seems doubly mean,

15:03.872 --> 15:05.873
and I'm not trying to be mean at all.

15:05.907 --> 15:06.907
What?

15:06.942 --> 15:08.242
This morning, you were all,

15:08.277 --> 15:10.578
"Let's temper expectations,
que sera, sera."

15:10.612 --> 15:13.581
But you just said all of that
assuming you'd be named Captain.

15:13.615 --> 15:14.982
I'm not assuming anything...

15:15.017 --> 15:16.263
Hmm.

15:16.298 --> 15:17.485
...but, boy, do I want it.

15:17.519 --> 15:20.488
Look at you... embracing your badassery.

15:20.522 --> 15:22.089
My job is done...

15:22.124 --> 15:23.724
until I apply for lieutenant,

15:23.759 --> 15:25.491
give you a run for your money.

15:26.528 --> 15:27.995
There's nothing else in here we can use.

15:28.578 --> 15:29.654
Yeah, let's keep looking.

15:29.688 --> 15:30.703
It's getting hotter

15:30.728 --> 15:31.666
in here, Montgomery.

15:31.700 --> 15:33.601
Is that fire out yet? Over.

15:33.635 --> 15:35.770
Negative... encountering
some complications,

15:35.804 --> 15:38.539
but we're on it. We'll get it.

15:38.573 --> 15:39.407
So, I know Lieutenant Gibson

15:39.441 --> 15:40.508
said we shouldn't worry or anything...

15:40.542 --> 15:42.216
- Not yet.
- ...but in times

15:42.241 --> 15:43.577
of extreme circumstance,

15:43.612 --> 15:46.345
I think sometimes our baser
emotions can surface.

15:46.815 --> 15:50.418
I've been getting these vibes,
and I think it's pretty clear

15:50.452 --> 15:52.053
that Lieutenant Gibson is into me.

15:53.755 --> 15:56.023
We bonded over disaster
preparedness before,

15:56.058 --> 15:58.859
and now we're trapped here.

15:58.894 --> 16:02.596
It's getting hotter.
Emotions will amplify.

16:02.631 --> 16:04.398
I'd like to head this off at the pass.

16:04.433 --> 16:07.802
He deserves someone great,
but that person is not me.

16:07.836 --> 16:09.737
How do I say that to him nicely?

16:11.106 --> 16:12.740
I don't...

16:12.774 --> 16:14.742
- Um...
- You know, I left my keys in the house.

16:14.776 --> 16:16.777
Otherwise, I'd say that
we should just jump in the car

16:16.812 --> 16:17.812
and crank the A.C. to cool down.

16:17.846 --> 16:20.614
A.C. sounds amazing,
but it's also a bad idea...

16:20.649 --> 16:21.582
carbon monoxide.

16:21.616 --> 16:23.818
What I wish we could do
is open that trunk.

16:23.852 --> 16:25.886
Do you think we have a jack in there?

16:25.921 --> 16:28.155
Ah! There they are!

16:28.190 --> 16:30.624
My tools!

16:30.659 --> 16:32.093
Envisioned tools
that were bigger than this...

16:32.127 --> 16:33.427
don't know how those are gonna help.

16:33.462 --> 16:34.727
Not so fast.

16:44.673 --> 16:46.073
What, you think Tanner's the only cop

16:46.108 --> 16:47.842
with a petty criminal history?

16:48.944 --> 16:51.579
- Oh.
- Nice.

16:51.613 --> 16:53.514
Come on. Please be in here. Please.

16:53.548 --> 16:55.649
Ah! Yes.

16:55.684 --> 16:56.484
- Come on!
- Let's do this.

16:56.518 --> 16:57.918
Come on. Come on.

16:57.953 --> 16:59.453
Montgomery, you got the jaws
ready out there?

16:59.488 --> 17:00.488
Meet me in middle bravo.

17:00.522 --> 17:02.790
That's an affirmative.

17:02.824 --> 17:04.458
If we can unhinge the door up just enough

17:04.492 --> 17:06.160
to get the jaws under it,
we may have a shot

17:06.194 --> 17:07.694
at getting enough leverage
to get it open.

17:07.729 --> 17:09.597
All right. Ready when you are, Gibson.

17:09.631 --> 17:12.700
Ready! One, two, three!

17:14.136 --> 17:17.471
Come on! Keep going! Come on!

17:18.906 --> 17:20.006
- Go, go!
- Come on!

17:24.746 --> 17:27.221
Switch with me. Switch with me.

17:27.256 --> 17:28.148
Hold it.

17:28.183 --> 17:29.383
- Ready?
- You guys ready?

17:29.418 --> 17:32.820
- Yeah.
- Yeah. 1... 2... 3!

17:36.324 --> 17:37.458
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Come on!

17:37.492 --> 17:38.626
- Oh!
- Come on!

17:38.660 --> 17:40.494
We got this!

17:40.529 --> 17:42.163
Come on, come on, come on!

17:43.765 --> 17:46.333
- It's not working.
- Damn it.

17:46.368 --> 17:48.002
Back to the drawing board, Montgomery.

17:49.237 --> 17:51.705
Over here. Give it to me.

17:56.711 --> 17:57.812
The temp's rising quickly.

17:57.846 --> 18:00.347
Montgomery, status check...
How's it coming out there?

18:00.382 --> 18:02.716
Still working hard with the diamond
saws and the Jaws of Life.

18:02.751 --> 18:05.719
And inside the house... Well,
the fire's started to spread.

18:05.754 --> 18:06.921
Copy.

18:06.955 --> 18:08.856
This room's like an oven.

18:08.890 --> 18:11.025
The fire in the house
is approaching closer by now

18:11.059 --> 18:12.760
just by the feel of things in here.

18:12.794 --> 18:14.728
It's not like an oven... it is one.

18:14.763 --> 18:16.706
Until they control that fire...

18:17.632 --> 18:19.099
And all you want is to get at it.

18:19.134 --> 18:20.935
You know I do.

18:29.544 --> 18:31.245
We can try the other side again.

18:31.279 --> 18:32.513
Nothing?

18:32.547 --> 18:34.515
- Damn it!
- No!

18:35.951 --> 18:37.418
The smoke's getting worse.
Why is it getting worse?

18:37.452 --> 18:39.920
It's a mess in there...
two other units plus ours.

18:39.955 --> 18:41.088
We can't seem to get a foothold.

18:41.122 --> 18:42.156
The fire just keeps growing because

18:42.190 --> 18:44.091
- there's no way to vent it.
- We have to vent it.

18:44.125 --> 18:46.126
It's heating up this garage
with our people inside of it.

18:46.161 --> 18:48.395
The house has every window
reinforced with security glass

18:48.430 --> 18:49.864
that literally will not shatter.

18:49.898 --> 18:51.966
What? No! They're...
They're windows, okay?

18:52.000 --> 18:53.734
- They can shatter.
- I'm telling you, no.

18:53.768 --> 18:55.102
Montgomery, copy.

18:55.136 --> 18:58.472
You got an ETA?

18:58.507 --> 18:59.707
Hey, guys.

19:00.642 --> 19:03.225
Might be another minute.

19:07.212 --> 19:08.619
Everything breaks...

19:10.696 --> 19:12.063
with the right amount of force.

19:12.097 --> 19:14.299
Hey! Miller, where are you going?

19:14.333 --> 19:15.667
Warren, will you go with him?

19:21.106 --> 19:22.573
Miller, I really don't think
you understood me

19:22.608 --> 19:23.741
when I said that the glass...

19:27.513 --> 19:28.913
We have to ventilate this fire.

19:30.616 --> 19:31.916
We can't just let them cook in there.

19:31.951 --> 19:33.851
I know, man, I know, but this glass...

19:33.886 --> 19:36.254
Look, let's just look for another way.

19:42.795 --> 19:45.697
Station 19, Pruitt speaking.
How can I help you?

19:45.731 --> 19:47.265
Captain, it's Hughes.

19:47.299 --> 19:49.667
Oh. Hello, Victoria.

19:49.702 --> 19:51.169
To what do I owe this pleasure?

19:51.203 --> 19:52.537
Uh, Montgomery asked me to call.

19:52.571 --> 19:55.273
He wanted me to ask you
about 365 Victory Street.

19:55.307 --> 19:56.941
Oh, yes, that was a big one.

19:56.976 --> 19:58.943
That was one of three times
that my team or I

19:58.978 --> 20:00.945
got stuck inside somebody's garbage.

20:00.980 --> 20:02.547
Does he want you to learn it
from an offensive

20:02.581 --> 20:03.748
or a defensive angle?

20:03.782 --> 20:07.218
I think just the "How do you get
people out of there?" angle.

20:09.688 --> 20:11.289
I thought you guys were on a call

20:11.323 --> 20:13.458
with a contained residential fire?

20:13.492 --> 20:14.959
Yeah, we were.

20:14.994 --> 20:16.694
But now you need chainsaws?

20:16.729 --> 20:18.329
Who's trapped inside a garage?

20:18.364 --> 20:20.631
Just any tips you could give
would be super helpful, sir.

20:20.666 --> 20:22.413
Who is trapped?

20:23.702 --> 20:26.704
A few people, sir... including Andy.

20:31.377 --> 20:32.910
Dean, come... Come on, come on!

20:32.945 --> 20:34.912
You got to stop, all right?
You're wearing yourself out.

20:36.882 --> 20:39.350
We have to make a vent.

20:39.385 --> 20:41.753
- There must be a way.
- There has to be a weakness.

20:41.787 --> 20:43.654
These windows are not gonna give.

20:46.959 --> 20:49.093
The windows won't.

20:49.128 --> 20:50.561
But the wall...

20:50.596 --> 20:53.264
the wall below... it just might.

21:09.648 --> 21:13.718
Montgomery, we got ourselves a vent.

21:13.752 --> 21:16.687
All right. We got a horizontal
vent on the Delta side.

21:16.722 --> 21:18.756
Re-route all hoses over there.

21:18.791 --> 21:20.591
Let's go!

21:25.431 --> 21:27.432
Easy, easy. Just take sips, other...

21:27.466 --> 21:29.634
Okay. And now you're out of air.

21:31.770 --> 21:33.404
This one's done, too.

21:33.439 --> 21:34.972
I was so focused on keeping people out,

21:35.007 --> 21:36.707
I didn't even think
about people needing to get in.

21:36.742 --> 21:38.447
Well, maybe you should have.

21:39.645 --> 21:41.245
I'm sorry. The heat is just
really getting to me.

21:41.280 --> 21:43.781
All right, look, everyone just
needs to think cooling thoughts.

21:43.816 --> 21:45.650
All right, the body can self-regulate.

21:45.684 --> 21:47.485
Yeah, well, everyone
has their breaking point.

21:47.519 --> 21:48.920
It's 110 degrees in here.

21:48.954 --> 21:50.288
Audrey, there's got to be something.

21:50.322 --> 21:53.124
I-Is there an air vent or...
or, I don't know,

21:53.158 --> 21:54.725
an attic or... or a crawl space?

21:54.760 --> 21:58.296
No. The whole unit
is fortified six inches thick.

21:58.330 --> 22:00.932
All right, well, if they're not
getting us out from out there,

22:00.966 --> 22:03.334
we got to figure out a way
to get out from in here.

22:03.368 --> 22:06.070
First things first...
the coolest place in this garage

22:06.105 --> 22:08.139
is on the floor,
so that's where we're gonna be.

22:08.173 --> 22:09.645
Everybody drop.

22:12.111 --> 22:13.845
112 degrees now.

22:13.879 --> 22:15.646
Okay, if we get out of here,

22:15.681 --> 22:17.782
I'm gonna take the entire
station out for drinks, okay...

22:17.816 --> 22:18.983
just all the drinks.

22:19.017 --> 22:20.351
I don't drink, personally.

22:20.385 --> 22:22.453
I prefer to maintain
self-control at all times.

22:22.488 --> 22:24.922
There's got to be something that
can get us through that door.

22:26.792 --> 22:28.414
I've got an idea.

22:29.728 --> 22:31.796
Is there a screwdriver in here?

22:34.133 --> 22:35.867
Ryan... Just like old times.

22:35.901 --> 22:37.101
Ryan, what are you doing?

22:37.136 --> 22:39.470
What's it look like?

22:39.505 --> 22:41.506
That's a truly terrible idea.

22:41.540 --> 22:43.274
We can use the car as a battering ram.

22:43.308 --> 22:44.342
All we need is a dent

22:44.376 --> 22:46.010
to compromise the integrity
of the door from in here

22:46.044 --> 22:47.209
to help our team outside.

22:47.243 --> 22:48.646
You've seen how tough that door is.

22:48.680 --> 22:50.481
It won't work, and then
we'll be trapped in here

22:50.516 --> 22:52.350
with a damaged car
releasing carbon monoxide.

22:52.384 --> 22:53.784
It might work.

22:53.819 --> 22:55.686
- Tanner, just...
- We have to try everything.

22:55.721 --> 22:56.787
What if this could save us?

22:56.822 --> 22:58.156
- It's too dangerous.
- So is this heat!

22:58.190 --> 22:59.824
So is sitting in here, losing energy,

22:59.858 --> 23:01.626
hoping someone can make it
through that door!

23:01.660 --> 23:02.960
We have to try. We have to try something.

23:02.995 --> 23:04.950
Ryan, I agree with Jack.

23:05.898 --> 23:07.698
It won't make anything better.

23:07.733 --> 23:08.966
It can only make things worse.

23:09.001 --> 23:10.168
I respectfully disagree.

23:10.202 --> 23:11.169
- Ryan...
- I don't care.

23:11.203 --> 23:13.538
I'm Captain here,
and I'm telling you to stop!

23:13.572 --> 23:15.806
You're not my Captain.

23:20.579 --> 23:22.813
Ryan, turn it off!

23:22.848 --> 23:24.348
It's too dangerous!

23:24.383 --> 23:25.216
You won't dent the door,

23:25.250 --> 23:27.185
you'll just severely damage the car...

23:27.219 --> 23:28.719
- Please don't do that.
- ...for nothing.

23:30.422 --> 23:33.090
We can't risk the fumes
or the carbon monoxide.

23:33.125 --> 23:34.926
Turn it off!

23:40.766 --> 23:42.900
Well, maybe the next plan can
work on getting us out of here

23:42.935 --> 23:44.202
instead of killing us faster.

23:44.236 --> 23:45.603
At least I'm willing to try something.

23:45.637 --> 23:46.904
What have you got?

23:51.877 --> 23:54.779
365 Victory was one of my first
calls after making Captain.

23:54.813 --> 23:56.013
Two of my guys fell through a roof

23:56.048 --> 23:57.848
and were trapped inside a garage.

23:57.883 --> 23:59.750
The heat can cook them alive.

23:59.785 --> 24:01.519
Look beyond the obvious.

24:01.553 --> 24:05.223
Think outside the box and get them out.

24:05.257 --> 24:06.757
Yeah, I know, sir, but what happened

24:06.792 --> 24:08.426
to your guys at 365 Victory?

24:08.460 --> 24:10.027
Did you get their door open?

24:10.062 --> 24:11.068
I did, yes.

24:11.103 --> 24:12.697
Ye... So, you saved your team?

24:13.765 --> 24:15.533
By the time we opened the door,
they were gone.

24:15.567 --> 24:17.435
They suffocated from the heat.

24:24.153 --> 24:26.388
Station 42 says the garage roof
is covered in weld mesh

24:26.422 --> 24:28.123
and multiple layers of metal tiles.

24:28.157 --> 24:29.324
We're never getting through
there in time.

24:29.358 --> 24:31.526
Damn it! Busted another blade.

24:31.561 --> 24:32.661
Well, what'd he say?

24:32.695 --> 24:34.396
Not much, except get the fire out

24:34.430 --> 24:36.464
and get them out before the heat
cooks them alive.

24:36.499 --> 24:37.835
That could happen?

24:38.768 --> 24:42.037
All of these years
with Audrey working late nights

24:42.071 --> 24:43.471
in this stupid garage,

24:43.506 --> 24:46.975
and now this garage can kill her?

24:47.009 --> 24:49.544
Okay. Oh, Ol... Oliver.
Oliver, hey, hey, hey.

24:49.579 --> 24:50.741
Let's calm down that breathing,
buddy, all right?

24:50.775 --> 24:52.047
Come with me, we'll get you some air.

24:52.081 --> 24:53.848
Command, this is Captain 42.

24:53.883 --> 24:55.884
We've extinguished the flames
on the bravo side.

24:55.918 --> 24:57.185
Hey, that's good, right?

24:57.220 --> 24:59.487
A little less fire... it should
cool everything down in there,

24:59.522 --> 25:00.755
you know, buy us some time.

25:00.790 --> 25:02.023
It doesn't work that way.

25:02.058 --> 25:03.525
The garage retains all that heat

25:03.559 --> 25:05.393
even if that part is extinguished.

25:05.428 --> 25:07.128
They keep cooking inside.

25:09.465 --> 25:10.865
No. No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.867
We are not losing hope.

25:12.902 --> 25:16.204
We are not giving up
on our friends, okay?

25:16.239 --> 25:18.373
- Think.
- T-There's no time.

25:18.407 --> 25:19.529
Every minute that they're in there...

25:19.563 --> 25:21.843
Time! We need more time. You're right.

25:21.877 --> 25:23.612
So let's buy some.

25:23.646 --> 25:24.946
This is Command.

25:24.981 --> 25:26.881
All units, I need every available hose

25:26.916 --> 25:28.116
directed at the garage.

25:28.150 --> 25:29.684
I repeat, surround and drown the garage,

25:29.719 --> 25:31.186
every single hose.

25:31.220 --> 25:32.420
Fire's in the house, 19, not the garage.

25:32.455 --> 25:36.124
I repeat, spray every single
hose on this garage right now.

25:36.158 --> 25:38.526
What the hell, man? You can't
redirect all the water outside.

25:38.561 --> 25:41.596
We have people inside here, not there,

25:41.631 --> 25:43.732
our people overheating, okay?

25:43.766 --> 25:44.966
We need to cool this garage down

25:45.001 --> 25:46.901
and spray every single thing
we have on it.

25:46.936 --> 25:48.770
We tried stuffing the turkey.
It didn't work.

25:48.804 --> 25:50.805
Now we got to baste this bird.

25:50.840 --> 25:52.540
Hey, you heard the man.

25:52.575 --> 25:54.042
Baste the damn bird.

26:13.095 --> 26:14.996
I just keep going over it in my head.

26:16.966 --> 26:20.635
No crawl space, no vents to outside,

26:20.670 --> 26:24.316
no cracks in the door or the walls,

26:25.141 --> 26:26.574
no tools can get though that door,

26:26.609 --> 26:29.077
but there's got to be something, right?

26:29.111 --> 26:30.312
To get us out, there's got to be...

26:30.346 --> 26:31.698
No, there doesn't.

26:33.549 --> 26:35.517
I'm sorry, Andy, but there's not
always a happy ending,

26:35.551 --> 26:37.585
There's not always a way out.

26:37.620 --> 26:39.421
That's the heat talking,
and the exhaustion.

26:39.455 --> 26:40.555
We're not giving up.

26:40.589 --> 26:42.924
I'm not saying I'm giving up.
I'm thinking practically.

26:42.958 --> 26:44.526
- So am I.
- So am I.

26:44.560 --> 26:45.960
Oh, will the two of you just shut up,

26:45.995 --> 26:48.463
God, for two minutes?

26:48.497 --> 26:49.831
I swear, it's a shame.

26:49.865 --> 26:51.266
What is?

26:51.300 --> 26:52.520
Nothing. Never mind.

26:52.554 --> 26:53.868
What is she talking about? I don't know.

26:53.903 --> 26:57.706
It's just a shame
that all this is happening now

26:57.740 --> 27:00.542
instead of later when I could
have been in the running.

27:00.576 --> 27:02.644
Are you saying if you were
Captain right now,

27:02.678 --> 27:04.546
we wouldn't be in this mess?

27:04.580 --> 27:07.282
Is this the heat talking,
or do you really feel that way?

27:08.517 --> 27:10.904
Never mind. Forget I said anything.

27:11.520 --> 27:14.522
There's got to be a way out
of this damn metal box.

27:18.494 --> 27:22.397
This door... it looks hydraulic.

27:22.431 --> 27:24.699
Could you hijack the motor,

27:24.734 --> 27:26.334
open it to the inside of the house?

27:26.369 --> 27:29.537
Isn't there a fire
on the other side of that door?

27:29.572 --> 27:31.005
We're firefighters.

27:31.040 --> 27:33.675
- We're not.
- We can get you guys out.

27:33.709 --> 27:37.212
I don't know. I didn't design
the motor, but maybe.

27:45.588 --> 27:47.489
Some of the wires look melted,

27:47.523 --> 27:49.557
but if you guys are fast,
we might have a shot.

27:54.697 --> 27:57.031
Come on.

27:58.608 --> 27:59.687
Anything?

27:59.722 --> 28:01.836
Aah!

28:03.572 --> 28:04.958
Damn it.

28:06.308 --> 28:07.742
The wires are too fried.

28:25.761 --> 28:27.729
If we get out of here,

28:27.763 --> 28:29.441
I got to tell Oliver...

28:31.333 --> 28:33.568
it's not his fault
that we're splitting up.

28:35.638 --> 28:37.939
Sometimes these things just happen.

28:42.845 --> 28:44.712
I hate that damn garage.

28:44.747 --> 28:46.781
I can't tell you how many times

28:46.816 --> 28:49.884
I wish it didn't even exist, but...

28:51.086 --> 28:53.254
Oh, God, I don't want it to kill her.

28:53.289 --> 28:54.322
I know. I know.

28:54.356 --> 28:56.124
I mean, it is really hard

28:56.158 --> 28:57.926
when someone you care about
could be in trouble

28:57.960 --> 29:00.962
and you feel powerless
to do anything about it.

29:00.996 --> 29:02.931
I just lived through that
with a friend of mine.

29:02.965 --> 29:04.132
I feel you.

29:04.166 --> 29:07.854
That limbo is... is hard.

29:08.471 --> 29:09.571
And your friend?

29:09.605 --> 29:11.066
She's okay.

29:12.374 --> 29:13.942
Will Audrey be okay?

29:15.644 --> 29:16.691
With these guys on the task,

29:16.725 --> 29:18.580
I'd say she has the very best chance.

29:20.783 --> 29:23.618
Now breathe in...
your stats are still low.

29:23.652 --> 29:25.453
I understand it's an unusual request.

29:25.488 --> 29:26.855
We are in an unusual situation.

29:26.889 --> 29:28.289
We have six lives on the line,

29:28.324 --> 29:29.791
two of which are SPD,

29:29.825 --> 29:31.025
so unless you want to lose...

29:31.060 --> 29:32.360
...a couple of Seattle's finest,

29:32.394 --> 29:33.828
I suggest you locate that battering ram.

29:41.237 --> 29:42.504
Andy!

29:42.538 --> 29:44.372
Andy?

29:44.406 --> 29:45.807
Dad.

29:47.810 --> 29:50.512
Andrea, I need you to get up.

29:50.546 --> 29:52.524
Can you do that for me?

29:52.982 --> 29:54.382
I don't think I can.

29:54.416 --> 29:56.403
You can do this.

29:57.152 --> 29:59.387
Shake the heat off

29:59.421 --> 30:02.957
and find a way out of there.

30:02.992 --> 30:05.126
I tried.

30:05.160 --> 30:06.561
We couldn't.

30:08.697 --> 30:10.064
There isn't anything.

30:10.099 --> 30:11.366
You don't get to do this.

30:11.400 --> 30:12.700
You don't get to not fight.

30:12.735 --> 30:14.168
You have never given up.

30:14.203 --> 30:16.340
Don't start now.

30:18.007 --> 30:20.510
Esta no es la hija que crié.

30:22.211 --> 30:24.012
Pull it together, Andrea.

30:24.046 --> 30:29.017
You stand up
and figure a way out of there.

30:29.051 --> 30:30.385
You do that.

30:30.419 --> 30:34.489
You do that for me right now.

30:36.759 --> 30:38.445
We tried.

30:39.628 --> 30:41.406
I don't know.

30:42.097 --> 30:43.364
Andy...

30:49.355 --> 30:51.083
What's my rule?

30:52.158 --> 30:53.919
Embrace the pain.

30:55.495 --> 30:57.047
We can do this...

30:57.864 --> 30:59.931
you and me.

31:03.669 --> 31:06.804
The only thing
that can get through that door

31:06.829 --> 31:11.265
is the thing trapping us in here... fire.

31:11.290 --> 31:13.257
We need an explosive.

31:24.223 --> 31:27.192
Wait. The water heater.

31:27.911 --> 31:29.761
It... It has a pilot light.

31:29.796 --> 31:33.699
Pilot lights ignite things,
cause explosions.

31:33.733 --> 31:37.536
Explosions turn anything
into a high-velocity projectile.

31:37.570 --> 31:39.137
It's worth a shot.

31:39.172 --> 31:42.507
We just need something
for the pilot light to ignite.

31:42.542 --> 31:43.975
An accelerant.

31:44.010 --> 31:45.512
Or gasoline...

31:47.013 --> 31:49.047
from the car.

31:49.082 --> 31:51.683
We can unstrap
the water heater from the wall,

31:51.718 --> 31:53.518
lay it on its side.

31:53.553 --> 31:56.188
We can use the pilot light
to start the fuse

31:56.222 --> 31:58.490
and hope the explosion is strong enough

31:58.524 --> 32:00.292
to launch the water heater
through this door

32:00.326 --> 32:01.526
to make an opening.

32:01.561 --> 32:03.028
That's insane.

32:03.062 --> 32:05.063
Well, there are no sane options here.

32:05.098 --> 32:09.501
Our choices are crazy or death.

32:09.535 --> 32:11.036
I choose crazy.

32:11.070 --> 32:13.582
Well, if we're gonna do it,
we should do it now

32:14.207 --> 32:17.175
before we're too weak to even try.

32:29.222 --> 32:31.356
Okay. Okay.

32:31.391 --> 32:33.658
Gentle. We don't want
to put out the pilot light.

32:37.764 --> 32:39.364
Give me a rag, please.

32:40.533 --> 32:43.034
Okay. Okay.

32:43.069 --> 32:45.670
- Um...
- Right here... slide it over.

32:45.705 --> 32:46.605
Okay.

32:46.639 --> 32:49.174
Never thought a bomb might save my life.

32:49.208 --> 32:50.675
Everyone take cover!

32:51.911 --> 32:53.278
Put this on.

32:53.312 --> 32:54.880
Travis, clear the door.

32:54.914 --> 32:56.581
Copy that. Pulling back.

32:56.616 --> 32:57.783
Everybody back!

33:00.086 --> 33:01.052
Okay.

33:01.087 --> 33:04.122
Once I light the fuse,
you have about 30 seconds,

33:04.157 --> 33:05.924
maybe a minute, before the boom.

33:05.958 --> 33:06.958
Everyone ready?

33:06.993 --> 33:08.293
We're good.

33:22.842 --> 33:23.975
The release valve...

33:24.010 --> 33:26.077
It must've come loose
when we tipped the heater over.

33:27.680 --> 33:28.713
- No.
- It'll go flying.

33:28.748 --> 33:30.282
It could kill any one of us.

33:30.316 --> 33:31.383
- Okay. I can get to it.
- Maya...

33:31.417 --> 33:32.451
Maya, Maya... I can get to it.

33:32.485 --> 33:33.452
Maya, what the hell are you doing?!

33:33.486 --> 33:34.553
Hey!

33:38.191 --> 33:40.158
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

33:44.096 --> 33:45.330
Okay, clear this stuff out of the way!

33:45.364 --> 33:46.932
42, you're on the door!

33:46.966 --> 33:48.033
Maya! Maya!

33:48.067 --> 33:50.302
Okay, everybody gets assessed.
Rehydrate with IVs.

33:50.336 --> 33:51.306
Are you okay?

33:51.331 --> 33:52.337
Cold packs on everybody's pulse points,

33:52.371 --> 33:53.839
and then cover 'em with what wet sheets.

33:53.873 --> 33:54.906
- Let's go! Let's move!
- Why would you do that?

33:54.941 --> 33:56.141
Huh?

33:56.175 --> 33:57.309
Why did you do that?

33:58.711 --> 34:02.347
Why did you do that?!

34:02.381 --> 34:04.449
The valve was loose.
It could have hit you.

34:04.484 --> 34:06.084
I thought I could make it.

34:06.118 --> 34:08.320
- Oh, my God.
- Andy! Andy!

34:08.353 --> 34:09.321
- All right, get back.
- Here. Come on.

34:09.355 --> 34:10.655
Dad! I'm fine.

34:10.690 --> 34:12.257
Take it easy. I got you.

34:12.291 --> 34:14.826
These guys needs water
and IV fluids, stat!

34:14.860 --> 34:16.761
And somebody get that gas shut off!

34:29.328 --> 34:32.370
Keep breathing this in
and keep the ice packs on.

34:32.395 --> 34:34.329
Your body's trying to recalibrate.

34:41.203 --> 34:43.036
I had a panic attack.

34:43.072 --> 34:45.072
Of course you did.

34:47.009 --> 34:48.309
In a weird kind of way,

34:48.344 --> 34:50.512
I think this is what we needed...

34:50.545 --> 34:53.815
watch all our stuff
go up in flames all at once.

34:53.849 --> 34:56.036
Rips the Band-Aid.

34:57.319 --> 34:58.853
Not all of it.

35:02.324 --> 35:04.359
This made it out okay.

35:10.166 --> 35:12.834
Glad you made it out okay.

35:22.578 --> 35:24.379
All right, all right.

35:24.413 --> 35:26.648
We're gonna do another round.

35:26.682 --> 35:27.972
Do Andy and Jack usually work

35:27.997 --> 35:29.217
- so well together...
- Mm.

35:29.251 --> 35:30.985
...even when they're mad at each other?

35:31.020 --> 35:32.187
My observation?

35:32.221 --> 35:34.989
- Uh, that's when they work best.
- Huh.

35:35.024 --> 35:36.858
Look, it... it either works,
or it doesn't.

35:36.892 --> 35:38.259
Look. Oliver kept talking about

35:38.294 --> 35:40.862
how things had pushed him
and Audrey apart,

35:40.896 --> 35:43.398
and they just stopped trying
to get back to each other.

35:43.432 --> 35:44.499
I mean, that happens, too.

35:44.533 --> 35:47.769
But, uh, yeah, I will never
let that happen to me,

35:47.803 --> 35:51.673
so I hate to bail on you guys,
but, uh, I'm gonna bail,

35:51.707 --> 35:54.676
'cause I am right across
the street from the hospital,

35:54.710 --> 35:56.611
Miranda should be out of surgery
any minute,

35:56.645 --> 36:00.515
and I will never stop
wanting to get back to her.

36:00.549 --> 36:02.283
I'm gonna go surprise her.

36:02.318 --> 36:03.618
Goals. Right there. Goals!

36:03.652 --> 36:06.020
Don't leave, man!

36:08.390 --> 36:09.357
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

36:11.293 --> 36:13.461
We see each other at our best

36:13.496 --> 36:15.363
and our worst almost every day.

36:15.397 --> 36:17.031
It's intimate.

36:17.066 --> 36:19.133
Andy and Jack are no different.

36:19.168 --> 36:20.268
But you already know that.

36:20.302 --> 36:23.037
- Yeah, of course.
- Mm.

36:23.072 --> 36:24.572
What are you over here telling him?

36:24.607 --> 36:26.107
You trying to scare him away?

36:26.141 --> 36:27.976
Nah. Tanner?

36:28.010 --> 36:29.110
You don't scare easy, do you?

36:32.114 --> 36:34.215
- Hey.
- Hi.

36:36.418 --> 36:38.086
What happened yesterday
with the alarm codes?

36:38.120 --> 36:39.973
Why didn't it work?

36:40.656 --> 36:41.716
- Um...
- You know, one of the guys

36:41.741 --> 36:42.724
from Station 15

36:42.758 --> 36:46.521
told me t-the panel was fried
and sparking from the jump.

36:47.162 --> 36:49.330
- Unbelievable.
- Yeah.

36:49.365 --> 36:51.933
Electrical malfunction... it happens.

36:51.967 --> 36:53.401
Yeah.

36:53.435 --> 36:56.571
- Well, salute.
- Yep.

36:59.275 --> 37:00.308
Thank you for covering for me...

37:00.342 --> 37:02.810
Don't thank me.

37:02.845 --> 37:04.612
You guys have all had my back.

37:04.647 --> 37:06.247
I've got yours.

37:06.282 --> 37:09.878
It's what friends do...
we look out for each other.

37:10.452 --> 37:11.586
I don't know what got you so distracted

37:11.620 --> 37:12.921
that you made a mistake like that,

37:12.955 --> 37:15.423
- but next time...
- There won't be a next time.

37:28.571 --> 37:29.704
Thanks.

37:29.738 --> 37:31.272
Whew.

37:33.576 --> 37:35.195
So, how long?

37:35.911 --> 37:37.545
Excuse me?

37:41.517 --> 37:46.521
How long have you and Ryan
been... getting together?

37:46.555 --> 37:48.958
What?

37:49.491 --> 37:51.192
You really didn't waste any time.

37:51.226 --> 37:52.360
Excuse me?

37:52.394 --> 37:53.861
Everything okay here?

37:53.896 --> 37:55.563
- No.
- Sure, yeah.

37:55.598 --> 37:56.731
Tanner, how'd it go?

37:56.765 --> 37:57.799
Were you just waiting in the wings,

37:57.833 --> 37:59.968
ready to swoop in
the minute the coast was clear?

38:00.002 --> 38:02.870
Jack, I wanted to talk to you.

38:02.905 --> 38:05.006
So I'm right... you two are together.

38:05.040 --> 38:06.507
Look, it's the last thing Andy wants...

38:06.542 --> 38:08.643
Don't you talk to me
about what Andy wants.

38:10.045 --> 38:11.679
Andy can speak for herself.

38:11.714 --> 38:12.847
I can.

38:12.881 --> 38:14.415
That's right, and... and I will.

38:14.450 --> 38:16.651
So do it... speak to me.

38:18.020 --> 38:19.654
How long has this been going on?

38:19.688 --> 38:21.489
Since we broke up? This isn't the place.

38:21.523 --> 38:23.493
Just answer the question.

38:24.793 --> 38:28.062
- Yes.

38:31.033 --> 38:32.333
Since before?

38:33.736 --> 38:35.570
Jack.

38:35.604 --> 38:36.738
Jack!

38:36.772 --> 38:37.939
This was not how I meant it.

38:37.973 --> 38:39.407
Jack!

38:48.717 --> 38:49.751
Oh.

38:55.958 --> 38:58.459
All right. Next round's on me.

38:58.494 --> 38:59.927
- Captain!
- Hey!

38:59.962 --> 39:02.296
This calls for shots!

39:02.331 --> 39:03.865
Where is Travis?

39:20.516 --> 39:22.784
Okay... didn't see that coming.

39:22.818 --> 39:26.287
I have a million reasons
to take things slowly.

39:26.321 --> 39:28.256
And I don't want you to get
ahead of yourself 'cause of me.

39:28.290 --> 39:30.491
- I understand.
- But I don't want slow.

39:30.526 --> 39:33.327
I should. I've tried.

39:33.362 --> 39:34.896
I know it's complicated,

39:34.930 --> 39:37.901
but... I don't want a slow burn.

39:39.168 --> 39:41.602
Tomorrow, I could be trapped in a garage

39:41.637 --> 39:43.671
trying to stuff a turkey,

39:43.706 --> 39:46.284
and I can't control that.

39:46.975 --> 39:48.995
But I can control this.

39:49.545 --> 39:53.548
You... I want you.

39:59.521 --> 40:01.007
Okay.

40:01.523 --> 40:03.991
But sometimes...

40:10.699 --> 40:13.868
...slow can be good.

40:17.673 --> 40:20.526
You can feel when
your temperature's rising.

40:21.443 --> 40:25.413
Thank you, Papi, for believing in me.

40:25.447 --> 40:26.681
You'd have figured your way out

40:26.715 --> 40:27.882
of that garage with or without me.

40:27.916 --> 40:31.119
I mean, about the Captain raise,
my promotion, everything...

40:31.153 --> 40:32.820
just thank you.

40:32.855 --> 40:35.123
The human body knows
when that balance is tipped.

40:35.157 --> 40:36.357
You know, it's not the end of the world

40:36.391 --> 40:37.925
if neither you nor Jack makes Captain.

40:37.960 --> 40:39.293
Uh, I know that.

40:39.328 --> 40:41.362
It knows when things
are getting too hot...

40:41.396 --> 40:43.549
Maybe it could even be better...

40:44.700 --> 40:48.136
bring the station together
united against an outsider

40:48.170 --> 40:51.139
instead of anyone needing to pick sides.

40:51.173 --> 40:52.367
...when the air around you

40:52.401 --> 40:54.709
starts to become too uncomfortable...

40:54.743 --> 40:56.511
I care about what's best for you.

40:56.545 --> 40:58.546
That's my job above all else.

40:58.580 --> 41:00.358
I want you to...

41:00.883 --> 41:04.051
- I want you to know that.
- What are you talking about?

41:04.086 --> 41:05.853
I spoke to Ripley.

41:05.888 --> 41:07.021
...when there's no relief,

41:07.055 --> 41:09.490
no cleansing breath, no escape...

41:09.525 --> 41:11.559
I didn't support you

41:11.593 --> 41:14.362
or Jack for the Captain position.

41:14.396 --> 41:15.630
...just the heat...

41:15.664 --> 41:17.031
- What?
- The station's a family.

41:17.065 --> 41:19.033
Picking one of you would disrupt that.

41:19.067 --> 41:21.035
- Neither of us?
- It's not like either of you

41:21.069 --> 41:22.670
went about this the best way.

41:22.704 --> 41:23.871
The other morning... this...

41:23.906 --> 41:25.573
this is what you were talking about.

41:25.607 --> 41:26.574
You both lied to me.

41:26.608 --> 41:27.667
- ...building...
- Why?

41:27.702 --> 41:29.343
You compromised your own situation.

41:29.378 --> 41:30.812
Why... Why... Why would you do this?

41:30.846 --> 41:32.180
I just told you.

41:32.214 --> 41:33.748
...and building...

41:33.782 --> 41:37.752
So you want us to be united
against... somebody else?

41:39.922 --> 41:41.365
Congratulations, Dad.

41:43.859 --> 41:44.835
You got it.

41:44.869 --> 41:45.893
Oh, Andrea.

41:45.928 --> 41:48.362
- No, just...
- Andrea.

41:48.397 --> 41:49.764
Don't... Don't wait up for me.

41:49.798 --> 41:51.833
I won't be home tonight.

41:54.369 --> 41:56.037
...and building...

42:05.113 --> 42:06.848
...until you're on fire.

42:07.305 --> 42:13.541
