Nick:
Ever since I was a kid,

00:15.999 --> 00:20.999
the burning desire in me was to
do what everyone else could do.

00:21.999 --> 00:24.998
When you go under the water,

00:24.999 --> 00:26.998
it's just freeing
and independent

00:26.999 --> 00:28.999
and, like, just the silence.

00:30.999 --> 00:33.998
I love to go in the pool
and feel independent

00:33.999 --> 00:35.059
and feel like
I'm doing something

00:35.083 --> 00:38.003
that everyone else is doing.

I'm Kanae, Nick's wife.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.998
I was born
in Melbourne, Australia,

01:54.999 --> 01:56.998
with no arms and no legs.

01:56.999 --> 01:58.998
It was such a great shock
to everyone.

01:58.999 --> 02:01.998
Obviously,
the first-born child...

02:01.999 --> 02:04.998
so much excitement,
anticipation.

02:04.999 --> 02:06.998
We expect a normal child
like everybody else.

02:06.999 --> 02:10.997
All the reports reported
all normal and all good.

02:10.999 --> 02:13.998
Medical staff, as well as us,
were quite surprised.

02:13.999 --> 02:17.998
Nick: As I'm being born,
he could see my shoulder,

02:17.999 --> 02:19.998
and he saw there was no arm.

02:19.999 --> 02:22.998
I actually felt sick,

02:22.999 --> 02:25.998
and it's kind of
every moment you feel

02:25.999 --> 02:28.998
that it was just a bad dream and
this thing is gonna disappear.

02:28.999 --> 02:30.998
It's not real.

02:30.999 --> 02:34.998
My dad went to the room where
I was, and he stared at me.

02:34.999 --> 02:37.999
And he went to my mom,
and he said, "he's beautiful."

02:38.999 --> 02:42.998
even though the doctors
told my parents that,

02:42.999 --> 02:45.998
"we're sorry.
he's not gonna walk."

02:45.999 --> 02:46.999
He's gonna be in bed.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.998
"He's gonna be a vegetable
for the rest of his life,"

02:49.999 --> 02:52.998
my parents took me home.

02:52.999 --> 02:54.998
They just basically said,
"okay, god."

02:54.999 --> 02:56.998
We know he's not a mistake.

02:56.999 --> 02:59.998
"He's just a gift
differently packaged."

02:59.999 --> 03:02.999
and... aww...

03:04.999 --> 03:06.998
They called it "phocomelia,"

03:06.999 --> 03:08.998
which means a baby born
without limbs

03:08.999 --> 03:12.998
with no medical explanation.

03:12.999 --> 03:15.999
It's just one of those things
that could not be explained.

Every morning, just about,

03:21.000 --> 03:23.039

and get me ready...

and all my personal hygiene,

How did you sleep?

03:34.000 --> 03:35.998
[ Chuckles ] good.

03:35.999 --> 03:36.999
That's good.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.998
Most people don't realize

03:38.999 --> 03:40.998
just how special
the relationship is

03:40.999 --> 03:43.879
between me
and my caregiver, Nate.

03:43.959 --> 03:45.998
Nate's been a caregiver
for several years,

03:45.999 --> 03:47.998
and so when you have someone
that close that, you know,

03:47.999 --> 03:51.998
you gain a trust and a
relationship with on that level,

03:51.999 --> 03:53.998
it is special.

03:53.999 --> 03:54.999
It is more than

03:55.000 --> 03:57.998
just a professional
service-provider position.

03:57.999 --> 04:01.998
We don't just want people
who can be qualified,

04:01.999 --> 04:04.998

Yeah, you do. Thank you.
about time you said that.

04:49.999 --> 04:51.998
My parents had
an attitude to say,

04:51.999 --> 04:54.998
"look, no one's gonna tell us
what our son can't do."

04:54.999 --> 04:57.998
We're just gonna give him
every opportunity

04:57.999 --> 05:00.998
"to become as independent
as he can be."

05:00.999 --> 05:04.998
I was actually the first
disabled child in Australia

05:04.999 --> 05:07.998

into the educational system.

I was sitting <i>on</i> my desk.

05:11.999 --> 05:13.459
We considered prosthetics,

05:13.542 --> 05:17.001
but they didn't prove to be
exactly what we anticipated.

05:17.002 --> 05:19.998
One is the weight
on his shoulders and his back.

05:19.999 --> 05:22.998
It also limited his mobility.

05:22.999 --> 05:25.998
He found mobility and movement
of his own body and usage

05:25.999 --> 05:27.998
being a much better option.

05:27.999 --> 05:32.998
We do underestimate
other people's potentials,

05:32.999 --> 05:37.998
but I think that it is important
to really learn

05:37.999 --> 05:40.999
that the challenges
of life make us stronger.

05:42.999 --> 05:45.998
When I first saw my son,
Kiyoshi,

05:45.999 --> 05:49.998
within the first three sentences
that ever came in my mind,

05:49.999 --> 05:55.998

"how did my parents do this?"

now that I'm a father.

and people talking about love...

I really find

the superwoman
that I would really need

about the fact

and see the love
that I could offer.

even hold my wife's hand.

"how am I supposed to speak
with her here?"

time stopped and we looked at
each other and we both knew it.

We both felt it was big.

08:29.999 --> 08:31.998
I felt it in my heart.

08:31.999 --> 08:36.578
I knew all she saw
was my eyes, my soul,

and the longing that I've had
for all my life is,

08:38.999 --> 08:42.998
will there be a woman
who can look me in the eye

08:42.999 --> 08:44.998
and look beyond the rest?

"why would you want to go,"

with a guy like him?

really challenging."

have to help him.

in the heart,

than have arguments
with someone every day.

organization

10:22.999 --> 10:24.998
that helps me to share my story.

10:24.999 --> 10:25.999
At 19 years old,

10:26.000 --> 10:29.998
I found myself in front
of 300 sophomore students

10:29.999 --> 10:32.998
as one of my initial,
first speeches.

10:32.999 --> 10:34.998
My name's Nick.
how you doing?

10:34.999 --> 10:36.998
[ laughter ]

10:36.999 --> 10:39.998
And within three minutes
in my seven-minute speech,

10:39.999 --> 10:41.998
one girl in the middle
of the room started weeping.

10:41.999 --> 10:46.998
You could hear her pain.
you could hear her cry for help.

10:46.999 --> 10:48.998
She said,
"I'm so sorry to interrupt,

10:48.999 --> 10:51.998
but can I come up there
and give you a hug?"

10:51.999 --> 10:53.998
I said, "sure."

10:53.999 --> 10:56.879
so, she came up and she hugged
me and she cried on my shoulder.

10:56.959 --> 10:59.998
And she whispered in my ear,
"thank you."

10:59.999 --> 11:02.998
No one's ever told me
that they love me.

11:02.999 --> 11:06.998
"No one's ever told me that I'm
beautiful the way that I am."

11:06.999 --> 11:08.998
and I was in shock.

11:08.999 --> 11:11.998
If my parents never told me
that they loved me,

11:11.999 --> 11:13.998
I wouldn't be here.

11:13.999 --> 11:16.998
And it was at that very moment
that I realized, "wow."

11:16.999 --> 11:20.998
How many millions of people need
to hear that simple message

11:20.999 --> 11:22.998
"so that
they don't give up?"

11:22.999 --> 11:25.998
but I'm telling you...
never give up, all right?

11:25.999 --> 11:26.999
All right. I love you all.
take care.

11:26.999 --> 11:27.999
[ Cheers and applause ]

11:28.000 --> 11:29.998
And my speaking career
just took off.

11:29.999 --> 11:32.998
I've been able to go
through 57 countries,

11:32.999 --> 11:37.998
spoken 3,000 times in front
of a total of 6 million people

11:37.999 --> 11:38.999
all around the world.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.998
What if I was born
without arms and legs

11:41.999 --> 11:43.998
just to save one soul?

11:43.999 --> 11:46.998
Would that be worth it?

11:46.999 --> 11:47.999
Yeah.

11:55.999 --> 11:57.998
Hey, Nick.
mm-hmm.

11:57.999 --> 12:00.999
Nick. We got to
get going, man.

12:03.999 --> 12:05.998
[ Sighs ]
good morning.

12:05.999 --> 12:06.999
How did you sleep?

12:07.000 --> 12:09.998
All right.
you?

12:09.999 --> 12:10.999
So, we only...
we only have about 45 minutes,

12:11.000 --> 12:12.998
'cause we got to get going.

12:12.999 --> 12:14.719
We got to get you ready
quicker than normal.

12:21.999 --> 12:22.999
So, you know what you're
gonna talk about

12:23.000 --> 12:24.998
with this, uh,
group we're going to see?

12:24.999 --> 12:27.459
Well, I know it's, like,
youth at risk

12:27.542 --> 12:28.998
and, you know...

12:28.999 --> 12:30.998
like at-risk teens?
yeah.

12:30.999 --> 12:31.999
And what ages?

12:32.000 --> 12:33.998
I think 16.

12:33.999 --> 12:35.998
Around 16.

12:35.999 --> 12:36.999
All right.
we're late. We got to go.

12:36.999 --> 12:37.999
All right. Let's go.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.998
Dude, you've seen me drive.
we'll make this happen.

12:39.999 --> 12:40.999
Oh, he's running.

12:42.999 --> 12:45.998
I see a lot of teens
that have self-esteem issues

12:45.999 --> 12:48.998
and, like, they're
at a stage in their life

12:48.999 --> 12:51.998
where they're trying to work out
who they are,

12:51.999 --> 12:52.999
how they fit in this world.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.998
Being able to be a guy up there

12:54.999 --> 12:56.998
with no arms and legs
and smiling,

12:56.999 --> 12:57.999
letting them know
that they're beautiful

12:58.000 --> 13:00.999
just the way that they are...
you know, that's what I love.

13:04.999 --> 13:06.998
Nick: Hi, everyone.

13:06.999 --> 13:07.999
Together: Hi.

13:07.999 --> 13:08.999
How you doing?

13:09.000 --> 13:10.998
Good.

13:10.999 --> 13:11.999
Good. Good.
thanks so much for coming.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.998
I'm Nick.
uh, this is Nate.

13:13.999 --> 13:15.998
Everyone say, "hi, Nate."

13:15.999 --> 13:16.999
hi, Nate.

13:16.999 --> 13:17.999
Nate's my caregiver,

13:18.000 --> 13:21.998
and I'm just gonna get up
on the table.

13:21.999 --> 13:23.998
You know, I went to school
in Melbourne, Australia.

13:23.999 --> 13:25.998
As I went to school, of course,

13:25.999 --> 13:26.999
everyone was looking at me,
right?

13:27.000 --> 13:28.998
And so, one day,
this kid came up,

13:28.999 --> 13:31.998
and he said,
"what happened?!"

13:31.999 --> 13:33.998
and I went up to him,
and I said, "cigarettes."

13:33.999 --> 13:36.998
[ laughter ]

13:36.999 --> 13:40.998
So, he's never gonna smoke,
right?

13:40.999 --> 13:43.998
And I realized I have a choice

13:43.999 --> 13:45.998
to either be angry
for what we don't have

13:45.999 --> 13:47.998
or be thankful
for what we do have.

13:47.999 --> 13:51.998
There was one time after
a very difficult day at school,

13:51.999 --> 13:52.999
being bullied and teased,

13:53.000 --> 13:55.998
I came home, and I decided
I want to give up.

13:55.999 --> 14:00.998
And so I had thought of, how can
I possibly commit suicide?

14:00.999 --> 14:03.998
And to my surprise,
a thought came into my mind.

14:03.999 --> 14:05.998
And it was the picture

14:05.999 --> 14:11.998
of seeing my mom and dad and
my brother crying at my grave,

14:11.999 --> 14:14.998
[voice breaking] wishing they
could have done something more.

14:14.999 --> 14:17.998
And because my family
did nothing but love me,

14:17.999 --> 14:20.998
because they told me every day,
"Nick, you're beautiful,"

14:20.999 --> 14:22.998
"Nick, you're special,"

14:22.999 --> 14:25.998
"Nick, don't worry about
what other people think of you,"

14:25.999 --> 14:27.998
I stayed,

14:27.999 --> 14:30.998
and I look back at my life,
and I realize,

14:30.999 --> 14:32.998
"wow, look how much
I would have missed out on."

14:32.999 --> 14:33.999
it's one of the beautiful things

14:34.000 --> 14:36.998
about why I love to be able
to share my story,

14:36.999 --> 14:40.998
not just because someone
might find

14:40.999 --> 14:42.998
hope and purpose in their life
and faith

14:42.999 --> 14:44.998
but because I remember

14:44.999 --> 14:47.998
just how thankful I need to be
every day.

14:47.999 --> 14:51.999
Sometimes,
you fall down like this.

14:53.999 --> 14:55.998
Sometimes you feel
like giving up.

14:55.999 --> 15:00.998
But I will tell you, miracles
can come from your broken pieces

15:00.999 --> 15:04.998
if you just give
your broken pieces a chance.

15:04.999 --> 15:08.998
Very simply, if I try to get up,

15:08.999 --> 15:12.998
and I fail 100 times,
am I a failure?

15:12.999 --> 15:14.998
No.

15:14.999 --> 15:16.999
So, don't give up.

15:20.999 --> 15:22.998
Does this look difficult?

15:22.999 --> 15:23.999
[ Chuckles ] yes.
a little.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.998
Good. 'Cause it is.

[ Chuckling ]

15:31.999 --> 15:32.999
When you fall down,

15:33.000 --> 15:36.998
sometimes you feel like,
"am I ever gonna get up?"

15:36.999 --> 15:38.998
yeah, you will.
you're gonna get through it.

15:38.999 --> 15:40.998
Well, who wants a hug?

when I'm like,
"I wish I could help you,"

16:04.999 --> 16:05.999
but at least,
if I can't help you,

16:06.000 --> 16:07.999
I can at least help myself.

16:26.999 --> 16:29.998

You're not ready for bed?

what you want now.

Okay.

it wasn't just the fact
that now we have a child.

16:52.999 --> 16:56.998
It's the fact now
that kanae helps me at home,

16:56.999 --> 17:01.998
and now she's got a baby
who has 24-hour needs.

17:09.999 --> 17:10.999
Definitely...
definitely another one,

Well, yeah, absolutely.

17:16.999 --> 17:18.998
There is just a lot to think of
and a lot to do.

you know, I don't clean up.

17:24.999 --> 17:26.998
I don't take out the trash.

17:26.999 --> 17:29.998

and now Kiyoshi.

17:29.999 --> 17:31.998
I know, but it's different.

17:31.999 --> 17:32.999
It's already like
we already have two kids.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.998
It's not like saying
I have two babies,

17:34.999 --> 17:36.998
but I have two people
to take care of.

17:36.999 --> 17:39.998

two children going on.

17:39.999 --> 17:41.998
Like showering.
like, showering is one example.

You know,
showering all three of us.

17:43.999 --> 17:46.998

when I'm like,
"I wish I could help you,"

17:48.000 --> 17:49.998
but at least,
if I can't help you,

17:49.999 --> 17:50.999
I can at least help myself

17:51.000 --> 17:52.998
so you don't have to do
so much for me

17:52.999 --> 17:54.998
in the evenings and stuff.

17:54.999 --> 17:58.379
And so I can brush my teeth
and shower myself.

17:58.459 --> 18:01.998
I feel like that independency
is important,

18:01.999 --> 18:04.998
but even more so for...
you know, for you,

18:04.999 --> 18:06.998
and so I just... you know,
and then that's why, like,

18:06.999 --> 18:10.998
I'm trying new things,
like with that car.

18:10.999 --> 18:12.998
One day, can you imagine
if I can go get the groceries

18:12.999 --> 18:14.998
or take Kiyoshi to school?

18:14.999 --> 18:17.998
If that involves trying
new things

18:17.999 --> 18:21.998
and becoming more independent,
that's so cool.

18:21.999 --> 18:22.999
Like, I-i love it.

18:22.999 --> 18:23.999

such a champion, you know?

that's worth it.

faced with different obstacles,

18:53.999 --> 18:57.998
and I've had to be creative
in how to overcome them.

18:57.999 --> 19:01.998
If I could help my family
by me helping myself,

19:01.999 --> 19:03.998
well, I'm gonna find a way
to do that.

19:03.999 --> 19:07.998
I'm all about never giving up,
so that's what I'm gonna do.

19:07.999 --> 19:09.998
I may not be able
to do everything,

19:09.999 --> 19:11.998
but I'm taking this
one step at a time

19:11.999 --> 19:14.998
and really celebrating
even the little steps,

19:14.999 --> 19:16.998
like being able
to take off my shirt

19:16.999 --> 19:17.999
for the very first time.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.998
With Kiyoshi and his needs,

19:20.999 --> 19:25.998
you know,
I-i feel like I could do it.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.999
I could brush my teeth
and I could shower myself

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
and I can tuck myself into bed

19:30.001 --> 19:32.998
and plug in my wheelchair
on my own.

19:32.999 --> 19:34.998
Yeah, sure, like,
if, when I'm single,

19:34.999 --> 19:35.999
having a caregiver there...

19:36.000 --> 19:37.998
yeah, we're friends,

19:37.999 --> 19:40.998
but there's just
something about us being alone,

19:40.999 --> 19:42.998
and the more we can be alone

19:42.999 --> 19:48.998
and have that normal dynamic
within a family, the better.

19:48.999 --> 19:50.998
For me, I never wanted my wife
to be scared

19:50.999 --> 19:52.998
that she's gonna assume
the role of caretaker.

19:52.999 --> 19:55.998
And one of the biggest fears
that I had as a kid

19:55.999 --> 19:57.998
was I'm gonna be a burden
to those around me.

19:57.999 --> 19:59.998
And I had this itch on my back,

19:59.999 --> 20:02.998
and I said, "babe, I'm so sorry.
can you scratch my back?"

20:02.999 --> 20:04.998
hey, babe!

20:04.999 --> 20:05.999
Kanae: Yeah?

20:06.000 --> 20:07.998
Uh, could I ask you
to shave me, please?

20:07.999 --> 20:09.998
Sure.
thanks.

yeah.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.998
Everyone, we are so happy
that you guys are here,

38:12.999 --> 38:15.998
so happy to have these moments
with you guys,

38:15.999 --> 38:18.998
and also, to make this
even more special,

38:18.999 --> 38:23.998
we have a beautiful surprise
that we want to share with you,

38:23.999 --> 38:24.999
so stay tuned.

38:24.999 --> 38:25.999
No, I didn't get a car.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.998
Dun, dun, dun.
[ laughter ]

38:27.999 --> 38:29.998
And it doesn't come with a bow.

38:29.999 --> 38:30.999
[ laughter ]

38:31.000 --> 38:32.998
[ Kiyoshi yells ]

38:32.999 --> 38:36.998
Wow. Kiyoshi wants to say
a speech, too.

38:36.999 --> 38:37.999
Right.
'excuse us for a second.

38:37.999 --> 38:38.999
[ laughter ]

38:39.000 --> 38:40.998
[ Kiyoshi yells ]

38:40.999 --> 38:44.998
Man: You just forget that,
oh, yeah...

38:44.999 --> 38:47.959
[ indistinct conversations ]

38:47.999 --> 38:48.999
Ready? Here we come!

38:49.000 --> 38:50.998
Yay!

38:50.999 --> 38:53.998
Surprise! Surprise!

38:53.999 --> 38:56.998
[ laughs ]

38:56.999 --> 38:58.998
Man: All right!
[ all cheering ]

38:58.999 --> 39:00.998
Nick: We're pregnant.

39:00.999 --> 39:02.998
Kanae: We're pregnant.

39:02.999 --> 39:03.999
[ Cheers and applause ]

39:05.999 --> 39:08.998
Did you like the stroller?
pretty cool, huh?

39:08.999 --> 39:09.999
Woman: Yeah!
man: Congratulations.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.998
We're super-excited.

39:11.999 --> 39:12.999
Thank you.
thank you.

39:12.999 --> 39:13.999
Man: Really.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.998
Kanae: Thank you for coming.
were you surprised?

39:16.999 --> 39:18.998
[ laughter ]

39:18.999 --> 39:21.998
I like the...

39:21.999 --> 39:22.999
[ laughter ]

39:26.999 --> 39:28.999
Nick: When I was growing up,
I used to use swimming

39:29.000 --> 39:33.998
as a way to feel like
everyone else, to feel normal.

39:33.999 --> 39:37.998
Now I've just driven a car,
I'm about to be a father of two,

39:37.999 --> 39:42.998
and my normal
is about to change yet again

39:42.999 --> 39:45.999
because of one amazing gift...
my family.

39:47.999 --> 39:50.998
Okay. [ Chuckles ]

39:50.999 --> 39:51.999
Daddy!

39:51.999 --> 39:52.999
Nick: Hey.

39:52.999 --> 39:53.999
Daddy!

39:54.000 --> 39:56.999
[ Mimics theme from "jaws" ]

39:57.999 --> 40:00.998
I got you!

40:00.999 --> 40:02.998
I got you!

40:02.999 --> 40:03.999
You gonna splash, splash,
splash?

40:04.000 --> 40:05.998
You gonna swim?

40:05.999 --> 40:06.999
Swim.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.998
Oh, look who's gonna learn
how to swim.

40:09.999 --> 40:12.998
When we were dating,
my parents asked her,

40:12.999 --> 40:15.998
"well, what if your child has
no arms and legs?"

40:15.999 --> 40:17.998
and Kanae's response was,

40:17.999 --> 40:20.998
"well, even if
all five of our children"

40:20.999 --> 40:22.998
have no arms and legs,

40:22.999 --> 40:24.829
I'm still gonna love them
the same,

40:24.918 --> 40:27.998
and at least our kids have
a good father

40:27.999 --> 40:29.998
"to be a good example
in through."

40:29.999 --> 40:31.998
yeah. Come on!

40:31.999 --> 40:33.998
And that's when I thought
I was gonna have five.

40:33.999 --> 40:35.998
[ Both laugh ]

40:35.999 --> 40:37.998
So, what do you think, Kiyoshi?

40:37.999 --> 40:39.998
You gonna have a brother
or a sister, huh?

40:39.999 --> 40:41.998
Gonna have a little baby?

40:41.999 --> 40:44.998
Is it gonna be a little sister
or a little brother?

40:44.999 --> 40:46.998
What do you think?
[ Kiyoshi babbles ]

40:46.999 --> 40:47.999
Ah.

40:47.999 --> 40:48.999
Did you say a brother?

40:49.000 --> 40:50.998
[ Kiyoshi babbles ]

40:50.999 --> 40:52.998
What do you feel?
boy or girl?

40:52.999 --> 40:54.998
Ooh, wa...
oh, I don't know.

40:54.999 --> 40:56.998
It would be so cool
to have a boy,

40:56.999 --> 40:57.999
'cause then, you know,
they can play

40:58.000 --> 41:01.998
and they'll be best friends
and share the same toys.

41:01.999 --> 41:03.998
Ooh, wa...!!

41:03.999 --> 41:05.998
Even the same clothes, right?

41:05.999 --> 41:06.999
Ooh, wa...!!

41:07.000 --> 41:08.998
But it would be cool to have
a Princess in the house.

41:08.999 --> 41:09.999
Oh, well, yeah.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.998
To be the best father I can be

41:11.999 --> 41:12.999
doesn't mean that I have
to be able to do everything.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.998
And she doesn't love me
because of what I do

41:15.999 --> 41:16.999
or what I can do for our family.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.998
But it's me wanting to help,

41:19.999 --> 41:22.998
wanting to do all that I can be

41:22.999 --> 41:27.998
to make our life as complete
and practical as possible.

41:27.999 --> 41:29.998
It's incredible to see you here

41:29.999 --> 41:33.998
and know you as a person
and know how far you've gone.

41:33.999 --> 41:34.999
It's all thanks to god.
we know that.

41:34.999 --> 41:35.999
Yeah, it's...
you know, it's a miracle.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.998
That's for sure.

41:37.999 --> 41:40.998
Well, whatever it is,
what an awesome adventure.

41:40.999 --> 41:41.999
Look at him.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.998
You're gonna be the best
big brother anywhere, right?

41:44.999 --> 41:47.998
Say, "the best."
say, "the best."

41:47.999 --> 41:48.999
big family adventures ahead.

41:48.999 --> 41:49.999
Say, "best."

41:50.000 --> 41:51.998
I know that I'm on a mission.

41:51.999 --> 41:55.998
It's not just going on different
platforms to share a message.

41:55.999 --> 41:57.998
The way we live our life

41:57.999 --> 41:59.998
and the way that we are
transparent to the world,

41:59.999 --> 42:01.998
we hope that people really think

42:01.999 --> 42:03.998
about their own life,
their priorities,

42:03.999 --> 42:06.998
and what they're looking for,
what they're waiting for...

42:06.999 --> 42:08.998
where is their happiness?

42:08.999 --> 42:09.999
Because we know that

42:10.000 --> 42:12.998
it's very easy to look
on the outside for happiness,

42:12.999 --> 42:16.998
but really, what's the most
fulfilling is what comes within.

42:16.999 --> 42:17.999
So, we know that our perspective

42:18.000 --> 42:21.998
is much more bigger
than arms and legs

42:21.999 --> 42:23.998
or even 90 years on this planet.

42:23.999 --> 42:28.998
There is more that we hold onto.

42:28.999 --> 42:29.999
I love you.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.998
And I love you so much.
oh, I love you so much.

Aah!

I love you, too, Kiyoshi.
mwah!
