- So Piper was engaged
before Leo?
- Yep, she was.

01:25.959 --> 01:28.109
Well, lucky for you, little man,
that did not work out.

01:28.209 --> 01:32.109
Actually lucky for all of us.
She was engaged to a warlock.

01:32.209 --> 01:36.899
- Dan was a warlock?
- Oh, no, before Dan.
Way before Dan.

01:36.999 --> 01:39.776
Two bankers, a rock climber
and a ghost before Dan.

01:39.876 --> 01:41.899
And actually, the ghost
was the best of the bunch.

01:41.999 --> 01:45.067
See, now, that's what
I'd call critical
sisterly information.

01:45.167 --> 01:48.067
How am I supposed to be petty
and judgmental without
all the info?

01:48.167 --> 01:51.609
Sweetie, what do you expect?
You didn't know her back then.

01:51.709 --> 01:53.859
It doesn't mean you're any less
a part of us, though.

01:53.959 --> 01:57.484

- Yeah, I know.
It would've been cool, though.

Maybe meet Prue.

If it makes you feel
any better, you didn't
miss much with me.

I'm pretty much the exact
same person I was back then.

- No, I'm serious.

And that's good.

But, you know,
I'm still living at home,
I'm still single.

02:16.167 --> 02:18.776
The only real difference
is that I'm five years older.

it happened either.

Oh, I resent that.
I don't mock you.

You always mock me.
I work my butt off around here.

so you wouldn't have to.

And I get no respect for it.
None.

I never asked you to give up
your career.

a problem with them too?

No, I have a problem with you.

walk away from me again.

That is what is going on.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.734
This is between us, it has
nothing to do with you two.

You know what, I don't know
what the problem is,

05:28.792 --> 05:31.899
but it's affecting
Piper's power. And if her power
is out of control,

05:31.999 --> 05:34.025
then it's our problem too.

Plus, we love you guys
and we wanna help. That's all.

05:36.999 --> 05:38.942

- Really?

05:39.042 --> 05:41.999
Before the next demon attacks?

05:43.167 --> 05:44.734
- What is this?
- Dr. Berenson.

05:44.834 --> 05:47.899
He's a marriage counselor
that I use to help me
with my column.

05:47.999 --> 05:51.275
I called in a favor and
he's expecting you, 1:00 today.

05:51.375 --> 05:53.401
- What?
- He cancelled his other
appointments,

05:53.501 --> 05:55.900
so you'll have the whole day
to talk this out.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.275
Come on, this is ridiculous.

05:57.375 --> 05:59.609
You expect us to go to some
mortal and spill our guts?

What you need
is a mortal doctor, Leo.

06:01.999 --> 06:04.150

not supernatural.

No, but I still think
he's from the past.

- Because Katrina, our innocent,

The warlock's after her
