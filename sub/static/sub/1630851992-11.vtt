00:33.408 --> 00:34.409
I am Iron Man.

00:36.661 --> 00:41.124
FURY: "I am Iron Man." You think you're
the only superhero in the world?

00:42.167 --> 00:46.546
<i>You've become part of a bigger universe.</i>
<i>You just don't know it yet.</i>

00:46.629 --> 00:50.216
-Who the hell are you?
-Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:50.341 --> 00:51.551
Oh.

00:51.634 --> 00:53.970
I'm here to talk to you
about the Avenger Initiative.

01:03.354 --> 01:07.108
We have no idea what other
intergalactic threats are out there.

01:07.192 --> 01:10.195
For emergencies only, okay?

01:11.071 --> 01:12.864
FURY: <i>And our one-woman security force</i>

01:12.947 --> 01:16.367
<i>had a prior commitment</i>
<i>on the other side of the universe.</i>

01:17.994 --> 01:19.829
S.H.I.E.L.D. alone can't protect us.

01:20.955 --> 01:22.582
COULSON: <i>Think you can find</i>
<i>others like her?</i>

01:22.665 --> 01:25.001
FURY: <i>We found her,</i>
<i>and we weren't even looking.</i>

01:31.591 --> 01:33.843
I don't wanna join
your super-secret boy band.

01:33.968 --> 01:38.306
(LAUGHS) No, no, no. See, I remember,
you do everything yourself.

01:38.389 --> 01:39.557
How's that working out?

01:43.645 --> 01:47.440
You wanna do this whole
lone gunslinger act and it's unnecessary.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.150
You don't have to do this alone.

01:50.276 --> 01:51.945
FURY: That's not looking so good.

01:53.530 --> 01:54.614
Meet Agent Romanoff.

01:54.697 --> 01:56.032
-Hi.
-I'm a S.H.I.E.L.D. shadow.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.493
<i>Once you were ill,</i>
<i>I was tasked to you by Director Fury.</i>

01:58.576 --> 02:01.037
You are mind-blowingly duplicitous.
How do you do it?

02:01.121 --> 02:02.956
You tear things...
You're a triple impostor.

02:03.039 --> 02:04.249
<i>Never seen anything like you.</i>

02:05.333 --> 02:09.003
At this juncture, we'd only like
to use you as a consultant.

02:12.048 --> 02:14.884
ROMANOFF: <i>For a man</i>
<i>who's supposed to be avoiding stress,</i>

02:14.968 --> 02:17.053
you picked a hell of a place to settle.

02:18.763 --> 02:20.431
Avoiding stress isn't the secret.

02:21.432 --> 02:24.102
-BANNER: Who are you?
-Natasha Romanoff.

02:25.186 --> 02:26.938
I'm here on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D.

02:27.021 --> 02:30.150
-BANNER: Why?
-Nick Fury seems to trust you.

02:30.233 --> 02:32.777
COUNCILMAN: <i>You're dealing with forces</i>
<i>you can't control.</i>

02:32.861 --> 02:33.862
What if I say no?

02:34.904 --> 02:36.739
I'll persuade you.

02:36.823 --> 02:39.576
COUNCILMAN: <i>You're running</i>
<i>the greatest covert security network</i>

02:39.659 --> 02:42.370
<i>and you're leaving the fate</i>
<i>of the human race to a handful of freaks.</i>

02:42.453 --> 02:44.497
I'm not leaving anything to anyone.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.166
We need a response team.

02:47.542 --> 02:49.335
Trying to get me back in the world?

02:50.837 --> 02:52.046
FURY: <i>Trying to save it.</i>

02:53.047 --> 02:55.466
We fight for the same cause,
the protection of this world.

02:55.550 --> 02:57.969
<i>From this day forward,</i>
<i>you can count me as your ally.</i>

02:59.429 --> 03:02.015
FURY: <i>These people may be isolated,</i>
<i>unbalanced even</i>

03:02.098 --> 03:03.850
but I believe with the right push...

03:03.933 --> 03:05.310
We need you to look this over.

03:10.231 --> 03:12.358
...they can be exactly what we need.

03:14.152 --> 03:18.448
<i>There was an idea to bring together</i>
<i>a group of remarkable people,</i>

03:18.573 --> 03:20.825
<i>to see if they could become</i>
<i>something more.</i>

03:21.701 --> 03:23.578
-ROMANOFF: How do we do this?
-As a team.

03:29.125 --> 03:31.544
COUNCILWOMAN:<i> I don't think you understand</i>
<i>what you've started,</i>

03:32.128 --> 03:34.130
<i>letting the Avengers</i>
<i>loose on this world.</i>

03:34.672 --> 03:35.673
<i>They're dangerous.</i>

03:36.132 --> 03:39.552
FURY: <i>They surely are,</i>
<i>and the whole world knows it.</i>

03:39.636 --> 03:42.430
Every world knows it.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.976
<i>Was that the point of all this?</i>
<i>A statement?</i>

03:49.229 --> 03:50.230
FURY: <i>A promise.</i>

04:09.582 --> 04:10.750
ROGERS: Avengers...

04:12.669 --> 04:13.836
<i>assemble.</i>
