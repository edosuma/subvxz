03:17.469 --> 03:20.836
I'm up. Ellington, I'm up.
I'm up. I'm up.

03:25.910 --> 03:29.368
She don't want to believe
that the boy is using drugs...

03:29.414 --> 03:32.612
but he comes home every day
with bloodshot eyes...

03:32.651 --> 03:36.917
and then he eats everything
in the kitchen.

03:36.956 --> 03:39.015
She knows he didn't
get those red eyes...

03:39.058 --> 03:42.152
from being in the library.

03:42.194 --> 03:45.720
I hear the boy can't even read.

03:49.968 --> 03:51.299
Good morning, Mr. Moses.

03:54.372 --> 03:56.533
What do you think?

03:58.811 --> 04:02.542
You think this is something,
check this out.

04:07.153 --> 04:08.814
What do you think?

04:08.854 --> 04:12.551
Look, girls, y'all just
gonna have to wait in line.

04:12.591 --> 04:14.821
Mr. Moses, let's make a trade.

04:14.860 --> 04:18.454
I'll trade you
The Best of Wynton Marsalis...

04:18.497 --> 04:20.726
for Duke Ellington
and Billie Holiday.

04:24.103 --> 04:25.229
Never!

04:25.271 --> 04:30.005
I would never give up
any of my records for anything.

04:30.043 --> 04:31.908
It would be like
cutting off one of my hands.

04:31.945 --> 04:35.210
Jeff, you're right.
Got to go younger, huh?

04:35.248 --> 04:39.377
Yeah. I'm getting me
girls on Soul Train.

04:44.757 --> 04:46.816
Have a good day, Mr. Moses.

04:52.298 --> 04:54.699
- Good morning, Mrs. Walker.
- Morning, Jeff.

04:54.734 --> 04:57.294
Thanks again for the tickets
tonight for that show.

04:57.337 --> 04:58.770
No... thank you.

04:58.805 --> 05:00.966
When the Georgetown Three
make it big...

05:01.007 --> 05:03.635
I'm going to say, "Special
thanks to Mrs. Walker...

05:03.677 --> 05:06.009
"who let me slide on my rent
when I didn't have it.

05:06.046 --> 05:08.446
"This Grammy's for you."

05:08.481 --> 05:09.914
Have a good day.

05:18.325 --> 05:20.419
Hey, Jeff, ready for tonight?

05:20.461 --> 05:21.587
You know I am.

05:21.629 --> 05:23.790
First show's sold out.
Second one's almost there.

05:23.831 --> 05:26.459
- Cool.
- And this device I invented...

05:26.500 --> 05:28.559
will monitor the vibrations
of the audience.

05:28.603 --> 05:31.094
- That's great.
- Just keep the music coming...

05:31.138 --> 05:34.903
from the baddest jazz trio
in D.C.!

05:34.941 --> 05:36.772
And I got some women
lined up for you.

05:36.810 --> 05:39.074
Michael, I told you.
I don't want to meet anybody.

05:39.112 --> 05:40.841
Come on, Jeff.
You got to get over Stacy.

05:40.880 --> 05:42.677
It's been four months
since you broke up.

05:42.716 --> 05:45.378
You got to move on,
experience life.

05:47.755 --> 05:50.223
- You're right.
- Anyway, first show...

05:50.258 --> 05:52.385
Debra's bringing
her cousin Denise.

05:52.426 --> 05:55.554
She's kind of fat,
but she's got a cute face.

05:55.596 --> 05:56.756
Cool, cool.

05:56.797 --> 06:00.324
Second, Anita's bringing
her girl. Says she's a ten.

06:00.368 --> 06:02.336
- A ten?
- Uh-huh.

06:02.370 --> 06:03.997
Without a weave, she's a six.

06:05.473 --> 06:07.907
That's cool.
I got to go. Warden.

06:07.942 --> 06:09.273
Just appease her.

06:09.310 --> 06:12.074
With this baby here,
you won't be here much longer.

06:12.113 --> 06:14.240
Move over, Wynton Marsalis.

06:14.282 --> 06:15.750
Cool.

06:18.687 --> 06:21.247
Aren't you going to say
excuse me, Dre?

06:21.290 --> 06:22.780
Excuse me.

06:22.824 --> 06:25.258
Thanks again for calling,
Mr. Reed.

06:25.294 --> 06:27.728
If he gets out of line again,
I will be back.

06:27.763 --> 06:28.922
Keep it!

06:34.402 --> 06:38.202
Ahem. Excuse me, Mr. Reed.
Mrs. Laws is waiting for you.

06:43.412 --> 06:45.039
You wanted to see me?

06:46.381 --> 06:48.474
Well, you've done it this time,
Mr. Reed.

06:48.517 --> 06:50.178
What did I do?

06:50.218 --> 06:51.515
Look.

07:07.202 --> 07:10.297
Louis, what happened to you?

07:10.340 --> 07:14.470
You. You're the one filling
his head up with all this junk.

07:14.510 --> 07:17.343
We have taught this boy
to stand up for himself...

07:17.380 --> 07:20.042
to fight the bullies,
but he doesn't listen to us.

07:20.083 --> 07:22.915
He said, "Mr. Reed
teaches us differently.

07:22.951 --> 07:25.977
"Mr. Reed said that we should
run from the bullies..."

07:26.021 --> 07:29.286
and that Mr. Reed
encourages the smaller kids...

07:29.324 --> 07:33.351
to practice running, hiding,
and eating their lunch quickly!

07:33.395 --> 07:36.057
I didn't say "quickly."
I said "rapidly."

07:36.099 --> 07:39.330
- I was trying to help.
- Well, thanks to your help...

07:39.369 --> 07:41.564
every bully at this school
is beating him up.

07:41.604 --> 07:44.072
A younger girl did this to him!

07:44.107 --> 07:47.133
Mr. Reed, have you ever
stood up to anybody?

07:47.176 --> 07:50.043
Or better yet,
have you ever had your butt...

07:50.079 --> 07:53.776
Mrs. Williams,
I'll handle it from here.

07:53.816 --> 07:56.376
Mr. Reed, may I remind you...

07:56.419 --> 07:58.216
that you are
just a substitute teacher?

07:58.254 --> 08:01.280
No more of this.

08:01.324 --> 08:03.816
I was simply talking about
how life is.

08:03.861 --> 08:05.590
I don't care.

08:05.629 --> 08:09.895
Teach only from the books
and not your philosophy on life.

08:09.933 --> 08:12.766
That's all for now.

08:12.803 --> 08:17.705
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

08:24.414 --> 08:26.382
If you have the meetings
in the evening...

08:26.416 --> 08:28.611
nobody wants to come out.
Everybody's just so afraid.

08:28.651 --> 08:30.448
It's a question of what
you people really want to do.

08:30.486 --> 08:32.148
Do you want this community
or what?

08:32.188 --> 08:34.089
Ted, I realize
that we are the community.

08:34.124 --> 08:36.785
That's right.

08:36.827 --> 08:39.125
Nothing's going to happen
until we do what I said.

08:39.163 --> 08:41.529
Are you down with o.p.p.?
You know me.

08:41.565 --> 08:44.500
I really do understand that.
We just can't go around...

08:44.535 --> 08:46.662
Let's cross the street.

08:46.703 --> 08:48.796
Put your hand down.

08:48.839 --> 08:50.431
- Hey, man.
- You want this?

08:50.474 --> 08:52.442
What for?

08:52.476 --> 08:55.775
I ain't crossin' the street for
nobody. Leave me alone, Maxine.

08:55.813 --> 08:57.748
- Dad, come on.
- Ted, don't be crazy.

08:57.782 --> 08:59.977
- Are you scared?
- Yeah, I'm scared.

09:00.018 --> 09:02.009
I don't have to prove nothing
to nobody.

09:02.053 --> 09:04.021
I want to see a hero,
I'll rent Rambo.

09:04.055 --> 09:06.023
You go ahead on, then.

09:06.057 --> 09:08.992
We got to get these young
people involved in this.

09:09.027 --> 09:13.690
What did I just say?
I said give me the green.

09:19.369 --> 09:22.167
You lucky that didn't break,
old man.

09:43.328 --> 09:44.852
See you later, old man.

09:44.896 --> 09:47.763
Don't see me later.
See me now, punk...

09:47.799 --> 09:50.563
'cause I ain't crossin'
no street.

10:16.227 --> 10:17.421
Damn.

10:24.870 --> 10:27.498
Gangs only take over
because you let them.

10:27.540 --> 10:30.441
If you would've challenged them,
they'd think twice.

10:30.476 --> 10:33.104
You know they got us
living like animals...

10:33.145 --> 10:37.309
with bars on every window,
alarms on every car.

10:37.349 --> 10:40.546
All I'm saying is, if we
would just patrol our streets...

10:40.586 --> 10:42.850
like right here
at Drake's Place...

10:42.888 --> 10:45.686
where all the drugs are...

10:45.724 --> 10:47.283
and with everybody wearing
one of these hats.

10:47.327 --> 10:50.421
Show them those hats, Maxine.

10:50.463 --> 10:54.024
If everybody wore
one of these caps...

10:54.067 --> 10:55.967
they'd know
that we meant business.

10:56.002 --> 10:59.028
- Ma.
- Don't you have a show to do?

10:59.072 --> 11:00.629
He needs money again.

11:00.673 --> 11:02.470
Your brother Kenny
never asks for anything.

11:02.508 --> 11:05.773
Dad! How much?

11:05.811 --> 11:07.574
I just need ten dollars for gas.

11:07.613 --> 11:09.774
You know, you should be coming
to some of these meetings.

11:09.815 --> 11:11.749
This is your community, too.

11:11.784 --> 11:13.217
You listen to what
Mrs. Walker's talking about.

11:13.252 --> 11:14.379
That's right.

11:14.421 --> 11:17.356
This whistle will be a signal
to everybody who hears it...

11:17.390 --> 11:18.948
to call the police.

11:18.992 --> 11:20.755
You crazy if you think...

11:20.794 --> 11:22.159
I'm going to walk up
some dark alley...

11:22.195 --> 11:25.460
with a loud orange hat
on my head and a whistle.

11:25.498 --> 11:26.795
I can see the headlines now...

11:26.833 --> 11:30.360
"Golden Lords kill old man
in loud orange hat...

11:30.403 --> 11:32.303
"and stuff a whistle
up his butt."

11:32.339 --> 11:34.739
Ernest is right.

11:34.774 --> 11:38.073
This patrol is a dumb idea.

11:38.111 --> 11:40.011
Oh, Elvira!

11:40.046 --> 11:43.448
No.
It's time we stuck together.

11:43.484 --> 11:45.543
Mom, Dad,
I got to go to the show...

11:45.586 --> 11:48.680
but she's right.

11:48.723 --> 11:50.554
We can't win.

11:50.591 --> 11:51.990
Don't upset your father.

11:52.026 --> 11:54.460
Ernest, I need you to help me
here, man.

11:54.495 --> 11:56.928
Listen, what about the kids
in this neighborhood, huh?

11:56.963 --> 11:59.363
Damn.

12:06.106 --> 12:11.010
They took my radio and my bass.

12:49.250 --> 12:51.741
What's going on?
Dre.

12:57.858 --> 12:59.348
Squirrel?

13:49.277 --> 13:50.437
Lords!

13:55.317 --> 13:57.980
This is your initiation.

13:58.020 --> 14:01.387
You want to be a Golden Lord?
Then get him.

14:01.424 --> 14:02.584
Lords!

14:22.011 --> 14:23.501
What's up, fellas?
Where's he at?

14:25.949 --> 14:28.076
What, y'all just gonna stand
around here looking stupid?

14:28.118 --> 14:29.278
Split up.

14:33.357 --> 14:37.225
Come on, Dre, he ain't stupid
enough to hide in there.

14:41.531 --> 14:43.021
You see something over there,
Squirrel?

14:48.771 --> 14:50.830
Nobody.

14:52.509 --> 14:53.806
All right, Golden Lords,
move out.

14:53.844 --> 14:55.778
Come on, move out
and check every corner.

14:55.813 --> 14:57.474
Move out, Golden Lords!

17:21.359 --> 17:24.329
Watch it. Watch it.
I got you. I got you, OK?

17:24.363 --> 17:26.354
All right. Let's...
Easy. OK.

17:26.397 --> 17:28.764
OK, let's go.
Clear a path, please.

17:28.801 --> 17:30.792
People, please,
move out of the way, please.

17:30.836 --> 17:33.828
Keep this door open.
Come on, open the door.

17:33.872 --> 17:35.431
- Bring him in. Is he conscious?
- No, ma'am.

17:35.475 --> 17:37.500
- Oh, my God.
- Calm down.

17:37.544 --> 17:40.172
He's going to be all right.
He's going to be all right.

17:48.688 --> 17:51.088
We'll cut him right here.
Gauze.

17:51.124 --> 17:52.853
- That's good.
- On your left.

17:52.892 --> 17:54.154
Thank you, nurse.

17:54.194 --> 17:57.391
Dr. Simmons,
take a look at this.

18:07.775 --> 18:10.335
Heavenly father...

18:10.378 --> 18:13.814
I know everything happens
for a reason...

18:13.848 --> 18:18.341
so I'll just leave it
in your hands.

18:20.387 --> 18:22.378
Amen.

18:33.801 --> 18:35.826
Excuse me.

18:35.870 --> 18:40.739
I need somebody to talk to
about my friend.

18:40.775 --> 18:42.709
I'm worried about his condition.

18:44.412 --> 18:46.676
What time you get off work?

18:48.416 --> 18:52.819
I just want to discuss
his condition.

18:52.853 --> 18:56.380
Visiting hours are over.
Good night.

19:06.735 --> 19:09.329
You're doing much better,
Mr. Reed.

19:13.507 --> 19:16.442
Don't try to talk.
You need your rest.

19:16.477 --> 19:20.937
My name is Vanessa, and I'm
going to take great care of you.

19:20.981 --> 19:22.608
Understand?

19:22.650 --> 19:24.551
Just push the button
on the side of the bed...

19:24.586 --> 19:26.110
and I'll be there.

19:30.058 --> 19:32.083
Are these the same X-rays?

19:34.596 --> 19:36.461
Jefferson, Jefferson Reed.

19:37.899 --> 19:41.391
Mary, would you give me
the blood vial on this patient?

19:45.340 --> 19:47.365
"Jefferson Reed."

19:54.317 --> 19:56.080
The patient's name
is Jefferson Reed.

19:56.119 --> 19:57.916
Dr. Jones,
you're needed immediately...

19:57.954 --> 20:00.388
in patient
Jefferson Reed's room.

20:05.994 --> 20:07.928
Cut the bandages away.

20:18.975 --> 20:22.934
Oh, my God.

20:22.979 --> 20:24.606
Let me have a mirror.

20:27.350 --> 20:29.215
This is how I always look.

20:31.854 --> 20:34.846
What we have here
is another case...

20:34.891 --> 20:38.327
of a patient
being diagnosed improperly.

20:38.361 --> 20:40.886
He was suffering
from third-degree burns...

20:40.930 --> 20:42.830
but there isn't
any scar tissue anywhere.

20:42.865 --> 20:45.733
Any real doctor
might assume that this is...

20:45.769 --> 20:49.102
a rare case
of the Stromburg theory...

20:49.139 --> 20:53.838
where badly burned tissue
has an adverse reaction...

20:53.877 --> 20:56.038
causing the tissue to heal.

20:56.079 --> 21:00.708
- Wrong! Wrong.
- I beg your pardon?

21:00.750 --> 21:04.584
Wrong.
The Stromburg theory states...

21:04.620 --> 21:09.580
that minor burns could heal
under stress, not third-degree.

21:09.625 --> 21:10.751
Look in the book...

21:10.793 --> 21:16.824
page 294, 3rd paragraph,
middle of the page.

21:19.770 --> 21:22.967
- He's right.
- Thank you.

21:23.006 --> 21:25.497
Dr. Jones wrong. He don't know
what he talkin' about.

21:26.743 --> 21:29.906
You really should reread
chapter fourteen.

21:32.649 --> 21:35.083
Chapter fourteen?

21:35.118 --> 21:38.451
Please, tell us why.

21:38.488 --> 21:42.892
In chapter fourteen,
he starts out talking about...

21:46.431 --> 21:48.899
What was I saying again?

21:48.933 --> 21:52.801
Thank you very much for
your medical tips, Mr. Reed.

21:52.837 --> 21:54.861
I just want to run
a few more tests...

21:54.905 --> 21:57.772
and you may leave
whenever you're ready.

22:06.883 --> 22:10.820
Oh, no, Mrs. Johnson.
They just called me, and I...

22:10.855 --> 22:13.449
They said it was on the floor.
I didn't understand.

22:13.491 --> 22:16.585
Really. Please try
to forgive me and understand.

22:16.628 --> 22:18.858
I'm just new here.
It's my first day.

22:18.896 --> 22:20.921
If I'd known
it was down there...

22:20.965 --> 22:23.991
You sure you'll be OK?
I'm really very sorry.

22:24.035 --> 22:25.332
Please try to forgive me.

22:25.370 --> 22:26.530
If you need anything,
just call me.

22:26.571 --> 22:27.799
Anything you want...
I'll be outside.

22:29.040 --> 22:31.975
Phil, when you get a chance,
take a look at this article.

22:32.010 --> 22:33.978
It has been a day!

22:34.012 --> 22:37.278
Dr. Jones is a piece of work.

22:37.316 --> 22:39.876
Had me running back and forth.

22:41.453 --> 22:43.853
I can't wait to get out of here.

22:43.889 --> 22:45.151
No. I'm talking about
the one right there.

22:45.190 --> 22:47.090
No. Look over there, girl.
Stop.

22:47.126 --> 22:49.059
He's all right with me.
He's cute.

22:49.093 --> 22:52.824
Of course he's cute. That's why
I'm telling you to look.

22:52.864 --> 22:54.764
You having a problem there,
Jessica?

22:54.799 --> 23:00.066
Yes. I put my money in there,
and it keeps eating my money.

23:00.104 --> 23:02.869
I can see through their clothes.

23:04.910 --> 23:07.174
This is weird.

23:07.212 --> 23:10.773
I can see through... anything.

23:45.217 --> 23:46.548
May I help you?

23:50.689 --> 23:51.815
Where's Vanessa?

23:51.857 --> 23:55.884
Vanessa? What can she do
for you that I can't do?

23:55.928 --> 24:00.059
I can do everything she do,
honey, and a whole lot better.

24:00.100 --> 24:01.658
Walking around here,
thinking she cute...

24:01.701 --> 24:03.396
showing them little pencil legs.

24:03.436 --> 24:05.836
Honey, I seen better legs
on a pool table.

24:05.872 --> 24:07.339
And another thing...

24:07.374 --> 24:11.037
Vanessa this, Vanessa that...
talking about how cute she is.

24:11.077 --> 24:13.875
I've seen something at the zoo
cuter than she was.

24:13.913 --> 24:16.507
Come on, get in there
with your half-dead self.

24:16.549 --> 24:19.017
Thank you.

24:19.052 --> 24:20.542
Let me tell you something.

24:20.587 --> 24:23.489
Here's my phone number.
Call me, sweetie.

24:23.524 --> 24:26.652
We can get together,
have champagne at my house.

24:26.694 --> 24:27.956
The bubbly kind, you know?

24:27.995 --> 24:30.691
And I got one of them little
bikini nighties, you know?

24:30.731 --> 24:31.891
See-through.

24:42.409 --> 24:46.778
We now run the market
in D.C., Baltimore...

24:46.813 --> 24:49.941
and Philadelphia.

24:49.983 --> 24:51.474
At the rate we're going,
in three months...

24:51.519 --> 24:54.920
we'll be ready to make the move
on New York...

24:54.955 --> 24:59.688
because if I can make it there,
I'll make it anywhere.

25:06.367 --> 25:07.891
Goldilocks.

25:12.740 --> 25:14.731
Hello, Mr. Byers.

25:14.775 --> 25:16.766
How are you?

25:16.811 --> 25:18.473
That's great.

25:18.513 --> 25:21.243
The boat comes in tonight.

25:21.283 --> 25:23.649
You brought me back something?

25:23.685 --> 25:27.143
Nothing.
We're just about to have lunch.

25:33.294 --> 25:35.524
Hey! Hey, boy.

25:35.563 --> 25:38.123
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me? Hey.

25:38.165 --> 25:39.894
I know you did.
I missed you, too.

25:39.934 --> 25:41.925
Are you hungry?
You want something to eat?

25:41.969 --> 25:44.962
OK, let's get something to eat.

25:45.006 --> 25:47.440
Let me see what we got here.

25:49.044 --> 25:53.276
Let me see.
Chicken, liver, beefy beef.

26:38.727 --> 26:39.922
Come in.

26:39.962 --> 26:41.657
What up?

26:41.697 --> 26:43.892
Got you your mail...

26:43.933 --> 26:48.165
bills, bills, Upscale, Jet.

26:48.204 --> 26:52.004
Michael, I can talk
to Ellington. Watch.

26:59.282 --> 27:01.079
Man, this is crazy.

27:01.117 --> 27:03.551
You barked. The dog barked.

27:03.586 --> 27:04.746
Trippin', Jeff.

27:04.787 --> 27:08.849
That's right. You can't hear me
talk to Ellington.

27:08.892 --> 27:10.519
Michael,
something happened to me.

27:12.262 --> 27:15.425
I can touch a book
and for thirty seconds...

27:15.465 --> 27:17.831
know and do
everything in the book.

27:17.868 --> 27:19.836
I mean,
grab any book in this house.

27:21.504 --> 27:24.530
All right. Jet.

27:24.574 --> 27:27.441
I know you ain't read
this one yet. Touch it.

27:31.714 --> 27:34.240
Put a stop to this madness
right quick.

27:36.553 --> 27:39.044
OK, page twenty.

27:39.089 --> 27:43.458
People page. Names...
Karl W. Taylor, Eric Sawyer.

27:45.796 --> 27:47.764
- Page thirty-three.
- Society world.

27:47.798 --> 27:50.426
It's a photo of a couple
that just got married.

27:54.805 --> 27:57.467
Centerfold. What does she do?

27:57.507 --> 27:58.974
She's an actress, a model...

27:59.009 --> 28:00.567
a dancer,
and a dental technician.

28:00.611 --> 28:02.910
She enjoys cooking and hip-hop.

28:02.947 --> 28:06.348
She's wearing a black bikini,
and she's fine.

28:06.384 --> 28:08.284
Yes!
What's her measurements?

28:11.489 --> 28:14.458
Thirty-eight...

28:16.193 --> 28:20.186
After you touch it, it only
lasts for thirty seconds.

28:20.230 --> 28:22.289
You really got superpowers!

28:22.332 --> 28:24.857
That's what
I've been trying to tell you.

28:24.901 --> 28:26.869
- Man, this is wild.
- Check this out.

28:29.741 --> 28:33.006
Jeff, you were hit by a meteor.

28:34.746 --> 28:36.941
Think anybody else
got superpowers?

28:41.886 --> 28:45.879
Larry? Larry, come in here.
Something's wrong with this TV.

28:47.592 --> 28:49.219
What's wrong, Mary?

28:49.260 --> 28:52.229
The channels keep changing
by themselves.

28:52.263 --> 28:54.595
They keep what?

28:54.632 --> 28:56.294
Fix it.

28:56.335 --> 28:58.860
It's this thing.
It's this right here.

28:58.904 --> 29:01.429
Oh, see, I know what's wrong.
I know what's wrong.

29:01.473 --> 29:03.031
Let me tell you
what's wrong with this TV.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.906
Them kids been here, that's
what's wrong with this TV.

29:04.943 --> 29:07.639
No, Larry,
the kids have not been in here.

29:07.680 --> 29:11.171
No, them kids been in here.
Trust, OK?

29:11.215 --> 29:14.514
They been in here
playing that hindindu, OK?

29:14.552 --> 29:17.385
And I told them don't be
playing the hindindu with my TV.

29:17.422 --> 29:20.585
That's why I got a four-bedroom
house for everybody.

29:20.625 --> 29:22.456
Everybody have a room.

29:22.493 --> 29:24.758
In other words,
you can't fix it.

29:24.797 --> 29:26.992
I can fix this.
That ain't no problem.

29:27.032 --> 29:30.968
I fix things for a living.
That's my job... to fix things.

29:54.227 --> 29:56.889
- What's up, Mr. Reed?
- Hey, Mr. Reed, how you doing?

30:23.923 --> 30:26.824
Aaron didn't bring his supplies
to class.

30:26.860 --> 30:28.293
He was sleeping
in my classroom.

30:28.328 --> 30:31.593
When I woke him up, he used
very foul language at me...

30:31.631 --> 30:35.260
you mother this,
you mother that.

30:35.301 --> 30:38.099
All right.
I suspended him from school...

30:38.138 --> 30:41.005
and that same afternoon,
I went outside...

30:41.040 --> 30:44.841
and all four tires on
my red mustang had been slashed.

30:44.879 --> 30:47.040
I suspended him again today...

30:47.081 --> 30:48.673
and do you know
what he said to me?

30:48.716 --> 30:51.981
"I hope you have bus fare."

30:52.019 --> 30:56.012
Absolutely unbelievable.
In other words...

30:56.056 --> 30:59.183
he is planning to do
the very same thing again today.

30:59.225 --> 31:02.991
Now, that's unbelievable.
He's gonna slash my tires again!

31:03.029 --> 31:04.929
What would you like me to do,
Mr. Little?

31:04.964 --> 31:08.297
I'd like you to transfer Aaron
to somebody else's class...

31:08.334 --> 31:10.495
because I have done
all I can with him.

31:10.537 --> 31:12.972
Being that
we're on the same team...

31:13.007 --> 31:15.066
I think I can handle
your transfer problem.

31:15.109 --> 31:18.203
Why don't I just transfer him
into Mr. Reed's class?

31:18.245 --> 31:22.875
Uh, that's fine with me.

31:22.917 --> 31:26.216
I mean, because
I really care about these kids.

31:26.253 --> 31:28.881
Well, so do I.
I have tried... really.

31:28.923 --> 31:31.949
But there are some kids
who just don't want to learn.

31:31.992 --> 31:34.961
But what did you say over lunch,
Charlie?

31:34.995 --> 31:39.729
"They don't pay me enough
to be a teacher and a parent."

31:39.768 --> 31:43.067
Look, I'm a schoolteacher.
I am not a baby-sitter.

31:43.104 --> 31:45.834
True, true,
but you don't give up.

31:45.874 --> 31:49.173
So the parents
don't always come through.

31:49.211 --> 31:51.873
It's the kids
that suffer in the end...

31:51.913 --> 31:57.077
and I'm sorry, but we've got
some of the grea...

31:57.117 --> 31:59.210
Yo, man, keep looking out
while I break in this locker.

31:59.253 --> 32:01.483
Keep looking out.

32:01.522 --> 32:02.750
What's he looking at?

32:04.258 --> 32:07.057
Greatest kids...

32:09.798 --> 32:14.861
Even if the parents don't
get involved, it's up to us...

32:23.378 --> 32:26.347
Do you have bus fare?

32:26.381 --> 32:31.284
These kids aren't bad...

32:34.957 --> 32:36.390
they're...

32:39.896 --> 32:44.390
These kids are ours.
They are our future.

32:44.433 --> 32:46.458
Now, I believe
that what Mr. Reed has said...

32:46.502 --> 32:48.093
is absolutely correct.

32:48.136 --> 32:50.570
As teachers,
it is our job to help them.

32:50.605 --> 32:53.540
We cannot give up
on our students.

32:53.575 --> 32:55.634
Exactly.

32:55.710 --> 32:57.541
You ought not to have been
messing with them boys.

32:57.579 --> 33:00.572
- Yeah, well, thank you, Ernest.
- Careful, now.

33:03.152 --> 33:04.278
What happened?

33:04.320 --> 33:06.185
Your father
thinks he's Superman.

33:06.222 --> 33:09.191
Nobody's walking over me.
I don't care how many there are.

33:09.225 --> 33:11.716
You know your father...
just pigheaded.

33:20.469 --> 33:23.768
You're back from the hospital
already?

33:23.806 --> 33:26.604
Yeah, that was fast, old man.
How you feeling?

33:26.642 --> 33:28.304
Get your hands off him.

34:17.226 --> 34:20.389
Seat belts... you got to wear
your seat belts.

34:21.931 --> 34:23.230
Man, I don't know
how you did that...

34:23.266 --> 34:24.666
but you're going
to be getting yours.

34:24.702 --> 34:26.397
Punk! You're going
to be getting yours!

34:31.109 --> 34:33.202
Man, he's something.

34:36.679 --> 34:38.170
Are you all right?

34:38.215 --> 34:40.342
Are you using steroids?

34:40.384 --> 34:46.880
No, Dad. That accident I had...
I was hit by a meteor.

34:46.922 --> 34:48.857
A meteor?

34:48.891 --> 34:52.454
And it gave me these powers.

34:55.500 --> 34:57.866
Don't tell anybody about this.

34:57.902 --> 35:00.598
Tell anybody?
The whole neighborhood saw it.

35:00.638 --> 35:02.469
Ma, just make up something.

35:02.507 --> 35:04.907
Just make up something.

35:24.496 --> 35:26.396
I'm late for class.

35:35.606 --> 35:37.403
A little late, ain't you?

35:37.442 --> 35:38.966
Have a good day.

36:14.647 --> 36:17.741
I think we got him.
Home, Mario.

36:30.796 --> 36:32.593
Something's wrong. Look.

36:36.535 --> 36:38.902
I hit him with everything I had!
You saw me, Goldilocks!

36:38.938 --> 36:41.270
Shut up. Shut up, Uzi!

36:41.307 --> 36:44.470
Man, back this thing up.
Back it up right now.

37:13.174 --> 37:14.971
He just...

37:16.677 --> 37:19.509
- Did he...
- Uzi, he just...

37:21.548 --> 37:24.540
Mario, home, please... now.

37:37.431 --> 37:39.592
What am I doing up here?

37:39.633 --> 37:41.533
I'm scared of heights.

37:58.752 --> 38:00.618
- Maurice?
- Yes, sweetheart?

38:00.655 --> 38:03.818
If you'd fix it,
I wouldn't have to ask you that.

38:03.858 --> 38:06.918
Can you drive me?
My car's acting up again.

38:06.962 --> 38:08.361
Yes, sweetheart.
I'll take care of it tomorrow.

38:08.396 --> 38:09.556
You know...

38:15.769 --> 38:17.930
Peeing Tom! Peeping Tom!

38:17.972 --> 38:20.702
I'm going to hurt you, punk!
I know your type!

38:20.741 --> 38:22.902
I got something for you!

38:22.943 --> 38:25.207
I'm not a peeping Tom!
I'm not! I'm not!

38:51.806 --> 38:53.171
Come here!

38:55.945 --> 38:57.640
Pervert! You come back!

38:57.680 --> 38:59.409
I'll be waiting for you,
you pervert!

39:03.953 --> 39:06.547
What in the world
happened to you?

39:06.589 --> 39:09.284
- Did you feel that earthquake?
- What earthquake?

39:09.324 --> 39:10.450
It's all over the news.

39:10.492 --> 39:13.950
The first one in
the history of D.C. Come on in.

39:13.995 --> 39:17.362
The earthquake registered
3.5 on the Richter scale.

39:17.399 --> 39:19.833
It was felt as far away
as Baltimore.

39:22.071 --> 39:25.165
Your mother and I stayed up
all night last night...

39:25.207 --> 39:26.697
thinking about your powers.

39:26.742 --> 39:28.835
Dad, I'm starting to get scared.

39:28.878 --> 39:32.837
The Golden Lords know who I am.
They did this to me.

39:32.882 --> 39:36.010
Relax. We've got to decide
what you're going to do first...

39:36.052 --> 39:38.350
clean up the crackhouses,
stop the Golden Lords...

39:38.387 --> 39:39.718
avenge me...
see what they did?

39:39.755 --> 39:42.019
Or then we could go after
the big drug dealers...

39:42.058 --> 39:43.355
or maybe you could go
international...

39:43.392 --> 39:45.622
go and get involved
in South Africa!

39:45.661 --> 39:47.822
Dad, I think
you are taking this too far.

39:47.863 --> 39:50.196
No, we're not. No, we're not.
No, no... come. Come with me.

39:50.233 --> 39:53.134
Your mother's got
a great surprise for you.

39:53.170 --> 39:57.038
Close your eyes.
Pumpkin, look who I've got.

39:57.074 --> 39:58.200
What happened to him?

39:58.241 --> 39:59.708
The gangbangers
tried to shoot him.

39:59.743 --> 40:02.905
But they couldn't hurt him.

40:02.945 --> 40:05.072
You can open your eyes now,
Jeff.

40:05.114 --> 40:06.809
Surprise!

40:06.849 --> 40:08.578
Mama, what is that?

40:08.617 --> 40:12.485
You gotta have a uniform
to fight crime, Meteor Man.

40:12.521 --> 40:14.853
- What?
- Well, just think about it.

40:14.890 --> 40:18.987
- Why did the meteor hit you?
- I don't know.

40:19.029 --> 40:22.624
I figured it out. It's because
we need a real superhero.

40:22.666 --> 40:24.600
These gangbangers
need a wake-up call...

40:24.634 --> 40:26.465
and you've got to have
a uniform.

40:28.972 --> 40:31.440
Because no one must ever know...

40:31.475 --> 40:35.002
the true identity of Meteor Man!

40:35.045 --> 40:37.445
Mama, would you stop talking
like that? And this uniform...

40:37.481 --> 40:40.245
Well, this costume...
your mother's gonna work on it.

40:40.283 --> 40:43.685
I didn't know it was gonna
look like this, pumpkin.

40:43.721 --> 40:47.555
Well, you're gonna be
the best-dressed superhero.

40:47.592 --> 40:49.457
- Better than Batman.
- Better than Superman.

40:49.494 --> 40:52.395
- And... what's that other child?
- Spider-man.

40:52.430 --> 40:53.590
Can't touch you.

40:53.631 --> 40:55.462
Now, I want you to come
on Tuesday evening...

40:55.500 --> 40:57.296
and I'm gonna fix
your favorite dinner.

40:57.334 --> 41:00.098
And I'm gonna work on it,
Meteor Man.

41:10.080 --> 41:14.882
That's because he was wearing
a bulletproof vest!

41:14.919 --> 41:20.755
And don't give me any garbage
about flying up a pole!

41:20.792 --> 41:25.286
If you lost him,
say you lost him.

41:25.329 --> 41:27.456
- But that's what happened.
- Shut up!

41:33.171 --> 41:34.968
I want to study him.

41:37.141 --> 41:38.973
Get me two recruits.

41:41.280 --> 41:44.147
The reason
for this special meeting...

41:44.183 --> 41:48.483
is to thank Jefferson Reed
for what he did yesterday.

41:48.520 --> 41:53.013
He single-handedly
chased away the gangs.

41:59.030 --> 42:02.932
Your mother told everybody how
you were hit by that meteor...

42:02.967 --> 42:07.667
and now you have
superhuman powers!

42:07.706 --> 42:09.173
Ma.

42:09.208 --> 42:12.666
I know,
but I'm just so proud of you.

42:12.711 --> 42:14.702
I used to baby-sit him.

42:16.615 --> 42:17.980
Got it.

42:18.016 --> 42:21.281
So, Jeff, we wanted to have
this meeting with you...

42:21.320 --> 42:24.346
to ensure that the community
stays safe from gangs...

42:24.389 --> 42:27.620
not just for us, but because
this is your community, too.

42:27.659 --> 42:29.183
That's right.

42:29.228 --> 42:32.687
So we've written down a few
things that maybe you could do.

42:32.732 --> 42:36.168
We want you
to patrol the neighborhood...

42:36.202 --> 42:39.797
three times a week
in your uniform.

42:45.411 --> 42:48.311
The community would like to put
another phone...

42:48.347 --> 42:50.508
in your apartment
with call waiting...

42:50.549 --> 42:52.949
the meteor phone...

42:52.985 --> 42:55.215
like Batman's phone
on the TV series.

42:55.254 --> 42:56.744
Beep beep! Help! Help!

43:00.126 --> 43:03.892
We want you to tell the gangs,
the junkies...

43:03.930 --> 43:08.924
the prostitutes and pimps
and the drug dealers...

43:08.968 --> 43:10.697
to get out of our community!

43:18.578 --> 43:20.876
Meteor Man! Meteor Man!
Meteor Man!

43:30.190 --> 43:33.182
I'll just tell them that
I don't want to be Meteor Man.

43:33.227 --> 43:34.592
I can't.

43:45.338 --> 43:47.306
Look at this.

43:47.340 --> 43:49.535
Oh, my God!

43:54.081 --> 43:55.981
This is just science fiction.

43:56.016 --> 43:57.779
You'll have to cooperate
with us.

43:57.818 --> 43:58.944
It's the only way we can...

43:58.986 --> 44:02.387
Don't make sense.
She never bothered nobody.

44:02.423 --> 44:04.152
Do you live in this community?

44:04.191 --> 44:07.160
Yes, ma'am. I live
on the second floor there.

44:07.194 --> 44:08.821
How long have you known
Mrs. Walker?

44:08.862 --> 44:11.160
I've known her
about twelve years now.

44:11.198 --> 44:13.860
I didn't see anything happen
to her.

44:13.901 --> 44:15.960
Thank you, Mr. Moses.

44:16.003 --> 44:17.903
Another senseless
gang beating...

44:17.938 --> 44:21.067
where no one saw anything
or heard anything.

44:21.109 --> 44:24.909
A 61-year-old woman is being
hospitalized this evening.

44:24.946 --> 44:27.915
I'm Janice Farrell
reporting for Channel Three...

44:27.949 --> 44:29.246
This is getting ridiculous.
We have to come over...

44:29.284 --> 44:31.912
in this neighborhood
every other day.

44:31.953 --> 44:34.513
- Got it?
- Yeah. All right.

44:34.555 --> 44:37.956
- All right. One more time.
- Yep.

44:40.260 --> 44:44.754
OK, guys, let's go.
I hate doing these stories.

44:44.798 --> 44:48.428
At least they got here...
the ambulance... on time, huh?

45:06.354 --> 45:08.413
I saw everything.

45:11.426 --> 45:17.525
This is never
going to happen again.

45:45.294 --> 45:47.387
Drop that loot!

46:02.445 --> 46:04.572
Do the laser eyes. Laser eyes.

46:04.613 --> 46:06.274
- OK.
- Watch this.

46:12.856 --> 46:16.883
I'm Meteor Man.
Put that VCR down.

46:16.927 --> 46:19.395
I don't have evidence?

46:19.429 --> 46:21.397
Now I do.

46:57.501 --> 46:59.264
Where is he?

46:59.302 --> 47:01.065
There he is.

47:07.145 --> 47:09.545
I'll be glad when he get over
his fear of heights.

47:09.580 --> 47:11.411
He will, he will.

47:29.499 --> 47:31.627
Yo, man. Hurry up, man.

47:31.669 --> 47:33.637
Just a little bit more, baby...
a little bit more.

47:38.409 --> 47:41.572
You can take your time, baby.
Don't worry about that.

47:41.612 --> 47:43.546
Hurry up, man.
I'm not playing with you.

47:43.581 --> 47:45.173
Come on.

47:46.184 --> 47:48.345
Get off me, crack boy!

47:50.188 --> 47:53.851
Drug-dealer people,
Meteor Man's in town.

48:03.836 --> 48:05.326
All right. OK.

48:05.370 --> 48:06.632
What's going on here?

48:08.273 --> 48:10.400
- Who the hell are you?
- Who are you?

48:10.442 --> 48:13.035
I'm the TV repairman.

48:22.286 --> 48:24.220
What the hell's going on?

48:24.255 --> 48:26.588
The TV looks fine to me.

48:26.625 --> 48:28.559
Have a good night, folks.

48:31.296 --> 48:34.959
Hey, what's all that noise?
What's going on out here?

48:35.000 --> 48:37.161
- Call the police!
- Call the police!

48:37.202 --> 48:40.865
- Cover me!
- He's over there by the car!

48:54.420 --> 48:56.115
What's up with this?

48:56.155 --> 48:58.555
What the heck is that?

48:58.591 --> 49:01.253
Put your weapons down.

49:05.131 --> 49:08.190
I want to talk to both sides!

49:08.233 --> 49:09.632
It's a trick!

49:20.078 --> 49:22.377
Stop shooting! Stop shooting!

49:24.417 --> 49:26.612
- Hold your fire!
- Hold your fire!

49:26.653 --> 49:28.644
Stop! Stop firing!

49:30.123 --> 49:32.717
Come on, cuz.
Let's get out of here.

49:32.759 --> 49:35.227
- Come on, G, let's break.
- Just shut up!

49:35.261 --> 49:37.024
Captain, this is suicide.

49:37.063 --> 49:39.156
We got to try
something different here.

49:39.198 --> 49:41.428
Yo, man, this is crazy.

49:41.467 --> 49:44.334
Come on, man, let's roll.

49:44.370 --> 49:47.498
Let's hear
what he's got to say.

49:47.540 --> 49:52.069
Easy, easy.
We just want to talk.

49:52.112 --> 49:54.910
Yo, put them down.

49:54.949 --> 49:57.975
I said put them down.

50:10.964 --> 50:12.932
Check your boy.

50:19.340 --> 50:20.773
What happened here, man?

50:25.079 --> 50:28.845
- Congress has voted against...
- Janice looking sexy.

50:28.882 --> 50:32.613
I bet if we went out one time,
she'd be my lady.

50:34.555 --> 50:36.022
There has been
yet another sighting...

50:36.056 --> 50:38.616
of the African American male
in a cape...

50:38.659 --> 50:41.321
Hey, Jeff, come here.
Check this out, man.

50:41.362 --> 50:43.763
He's reportedly shut down
fifteen crackhouses...

50:43.798 --> 50:45.891
stopped eleven
attempted robbers...

50:45.934 --> 50:49.370
and brought peace between
two inner-city street gangs...

50:49.404 --> 50:50.894
and the police.

50:50.939 --> 50:53.635
The gangs have now vowed
to work together...

50:53.675 --> 50:56.507
to rebuild the community
they have destroyed.

50:56.543 --> 50:59.808
And now we will have
an exclusive interview...

50:59.847 --> 51:01.371
with the caped man himself.

51:01.415 --> 51:04.407
You did an interview?

51:04.451 --> 51:06.510
Here with us live
is the caped man...

51:06.553 --> 51:08.885
Clarence James Carter III.

51:08.922 --> 51:12.984
Mr. Carter, people say
they saw you fly away.

51:13.028 --> 51:14.689
Can you explain this?

51:14.729 --> 51:16.924
Well, I move so fast,
people think I'm flying.

51:16.965 --> 51:19.365
I used to be a boxer.
I'm bad.

51:19.401 --> 51:20.993
We understand you have
a police record...

51:21.036 --> 51:24.267
for attempted burglary,
auto theft, running numbers...

51:24.305 --> 51:27.433
That's all behind me now.
I know I was wrong.

51:27.475 --> 51:29.443
I spent three years in jail
for that.

51:29.477 --> 51:31.672
I'm a different man now.

51:31.713 --> 51:34.307
I'm a crime fighter.
You crooks, beware.

51:34.349 --> 51:36.408
The flying man is here.

51:36.452 --> 51:38.249
Don't you roam...

51:38.287 --> 51:40.346
Everybody's going to think
he's me.

51:40.389 --> 51:42.687
Can you believe it?

51:42.725 --> 51:45.023
He's talking to Janice.

51:45.061 --> 51:47.359
Did you hear what I said?
We got to do something.

51:47.396 --> 51:50.193
He talking to Janice.

51:52.300 --> 51:54.962
A billion-dollar shipment?

51:55.003 --> 51:57.062
What is this?

51:57.105 --> 52:00.199
I mean, is this a joke?
What is that?

52:02.477 --> 52:05.106
Somebody! What?

52:06.916 --> 52:08.315
Somebody talk to me!

52:08.350 --> 52:10.409
Don't look at me
like a bunch of dummies!

52:13.956 --> 52:17.357
Anybody know anything
about this guy?

52:18.761 --> 52:21.491
Simon,
what do you know about this?

52:21.530 --> 52:23.657
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

52:26.602 --> 52:28.934
What do you mean, nothing?

52:28.971 --> 52:31.907
It started in your territory.

52:31.942 --> 52:35.070
Nothing?
What does that mean, nothing?

52:35.112 --> 52:38.104
I don't know anything,
Mr. Byers.

52:46.122 --> 52:48.647
They say he can fly.

52:48.691 --> 52:52.593
Well, I don't want him to fly.

52:52.628 --> 52:54.960
Gentlemen, I'm prepared
to offer a bounty...

52:54.997 --> 52:56.988
for this flying man...

52:57.032 --> 53:01.197
one million dollars alive,
two million dead.

53:03.306 --> 53:05.331
It's 12:37 in the a. M...

53:05.375 --> 53:09.004
and you're listening
to Rod Simmons on talk radio.

53:09.045 --> 53:12.572
Our show tonight...
the flying man of D.C.

53:12.616 --> 53:14.811
Does he really exist?

53:14.851 --> 53:17.342
Is he real or fiction?

53:17.387 --> 53:19.753
We want to hear from you.
We want to hear your calls.

53:19.789 --> 53:22.986
Call in now.
You know our number.

53:24.694 --> 53:26.686
Hey, Rod, man, I just want
to say that, you know...

53:26.731 --> 53:28.926
with all the black-on-black
crime in D. C...

53:28.966 --> 53:30.194
it's kind of nice to know...

53:30.234 --> 53:31.861
a brother's out there
trying to do something.

53:31.903 --> 53:33.063
Thanks.

53:34.805 --> 53:37.638
I just want to say, I don't
know if he's real or not...

53:37.675 --> 53:43.010
but I've got two kids,
and I just pray that he is.

53:53.925 --> 53:55.893
I think this is
a ridiculous scam...

53:55.927 --> 53:57.690
being perpetrated
on the inner-city...

53:57.728 --> 53:59.593
by ambitious politicians...

53:59.630 --> 54:01.154
stepping on the backs
of my people...

54:01.199 --> 54:03.394
for their own corrupt
political agendas.

54:03.434 --> 54:04.628
Peace!

54:04.669 --> 54:06.933
You're listening
to Rod Simmons. Yes, caller?

54:08.439 --> 54:12.034
All I know is that somehow...

54:12.076 --> 54:14.704
someone they call
the flying man...

54:14.745 --> 54:17.111
closed down a crackhouse...

54:17.148 --> 54:19.207
and it brought my son home.

55:34.826 --> 55:38.922
Yeah. Meteor Man.
His name's Meteor Man.

55:38.964 --> 55:41.194
You sure? It's Meteor Man...
that's what they call him?

55:41.233 --> 55:44.567
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a miracle...

55:44.604 --> 55:47.129
an outdoor grocery store...

55:47.173 --> 55:50.165
a garden
in the middle of the ghetto.

55:50.209 --> 55:52.939
It'll feed
thousands and thousands.

55:52.979 --> 55:54.503
Who is behind this?

55:54.547 --> 55:56.981
A few nights ago, we reported
that the caped man...

55:57.016 --> 55:59.382
was Clarence James Carter III.

55:59.419 --> 56:02.286
But the Bloods and the Crips
say that it isn't Mr. Carter.

56:02.322 --> 56:05.621
Our caped hero
wants to be called Meteor Man.

56:05.658 --> 56:07.990
No one knows his true identity.

56:08.027 --> 56:11.122
Well, whoever you are,
keep up the good work.

56:11.165 --> 56:13.895
And, Meteor Man, if you're ever
in my neighborhood...

56:13.934 --> 56:15.401
lunch is on me.

56:15.436 --> 56:17.904
I'm Janice Farrell reporting
for Channel Three News.

56:17.938 --> 56:20.065
Sorry, Michael.

56:23.543 --> 56:27.309
Excuse me. Stacy,
can I talk to you for a second?

56:27.347 --> 56:30.544
My Nubian princess,
these are for you.

56:36.924 --> 56:38.221
I love what you've done
with your hair.

56:38.258 --> 56:41.318
It just becomes your face.
It's great.

56:41.362 --> 56:45.298
Thank you.
Um, this is my boyfriend Malik.

56:45.332 --> 56:47.664
How we doing,
my beautiful sisters?

56:47.701 --> 56:49.669
And you must be Jeff.

56:49.703 --> 56:52.035
My brother,
I heard a lot about you.

56:52.072 --> 56:53.699
I'm kind of nervous, you know?
I'm new at this.

56:53.741 --> 56:55.208
This is my first
black girlfriend, you know?

56:55.242 --> 56:56.937
My real name's Bernard.
I just joined...

56:56.977 --> 56:58.740
this African American
liberation movement...

56:58.779 --> 57:00.041
and I'm feeling black.

57:00.080 --> 57:02.014
And I want to thank you
for the opportunity.

57:02.049 --> 57:03.813
I'm trying to greet somebody.

57:03.852 --> 57:05.285
I knew it was
your lunch break...

57:05.320 --> 57:07.185
and I want to take you to
lunch... if that's OK with you.

57:07.222 --> 57:08.780
I don't want to dominate you.
It's your world.

57:08.823 --> 57:11.314
No, it's quite all right.
I'd love to. Thank you.

57:11.359 --> 57:13.759
I am honored.
I am truly honored.

57:13.795 --> 57:16.286
Let me get your chair... please.

57:16.331 --> 57:17.456
Have a nice lunch.

57:17.498 --> 57:19.864
Yes. Don't you do that.
Let me get that.

57:19.900 --> 57:21.561
It's been chilly.

57:21.602 --> 57:23.900
Yo, I mean...
I got to get some class.

57:23.937 --> 57:26.201
Oh, let me get the door
for you, my Nubian princess.

58:00.042 --> 58:02.772
Good morning, Mr. Reed.

58:04.413 --> 58:08.008
Slinkies move like life.

58:08.050 --> 58:12.418
In one second,
everything can change.

58:12.454 --> 58:15.218
How do you do it, Meteor Man?

58:15.256 --> 58:18.123
You must have me mistaken.

58:19.961 --> 58:22.657
Excuse me, Mr. Reed,
I don't mean to interrupt.

58:22.697 --> 58:25.292
You're going to be late for
that meeting with the principal.

58:25.334 --> 58:28.599
Thanks for reminding me,
Mr. Anderson.

58:28.637 --> 58:30.036
Uh, I've got to go.

58:30.072 --> 58:32.939
Did you hear?
Just a few minutes ago...

58:32.975 --> 58:34.806
Meteor Man
destroyed another crackhouse.

58:34.844 --> 58:36.471
It was on the radio.

58:38.013 --> 58:40.413
Isn't that wonderful?

58:44.053 --> 58:47.386
- That's wonderful.
- No, Simon, that's the dude.

58:51.460 --> 58:53.326
I'm sorry.

58:53.363 --> 58:54.887
I was mistaken.

58:54.931 --> 58:56.796
No problem.

59:00.003 --> 59:01.493
Baby Lords.

59:02.539 --> 59:03.972
Junior Lords.

59:11.213 --> 59:12.578
Thanks, Michael.

59:12.615 --> 59:16.210
I seen them
sneaking in the back door.

59:16.252 --> 59:18.618
We got to get out of here.

59:18.654 --> 59:20.885
Let's wait until
they get out the parking lot.

59:20.924 --> 59:23.916
You got superpowers. I don't.

59:23.960 --> 59:25.552
Who does their hair?

01:00:13.678 --> 01:00:16.943
This is Big John on D.C.'s
number one concert station...

01:00:16.981 --> 01:00:19.506
FM 104.5.

01:00:19.550 --> 01:00:23.145
Hey, we're coming at you live
from Washington City Mall...

01:00:27.058 --> 01:00:28.525
I have a vacation
to the Bahamas.

01:00:28.559 --> 01:00:30.083
But first, we have
a very special visitor.

01:00:30.127 --> 01:00:32.561
It was the Golden Lords.

01:00:32.597 --> 01:00:34.622
Meteor Man.

01:00:34.665 --> 01:00:37.190
Good morning, Meteor Man.
Thanks for stopping by.

01:00:37.234 --> 01:00:38.701
Well, thank you.

01:00:38.736 --> 01:00:40.761
I'm just trying
to make D.C. Safe again...

01:00:40.805 --> 01:00:43.969
especially for all
the beautiful, sexy ladies here.

01:00:44.009 --> 01:00:48.241
And I would like to invite
my favorite TV anchor...

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:52.216
Janice Farrell
to join me for a meal.

01:00:54.119 --> 01:00:55.847
His last meal.

01:00:55.886 --> 01:00:58.821
Mr. Byers, have my two million
in the morning.

01:01:08.066 --> 01:01:10.398
I am Meteor Man!

01:01:10.435 --> 01:01:13.768
And I want to say hello to
all the lovely ladies out there.

01:01:13.805 --> 01:01:14.999
Now, I know a lot of y'all
are saying...

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:17.065
"Why didn't you
start helping us sooner?"

01:01:17.109 --> 01:01:19.100
'Cause I figured now
was the time.

01:01:19.144 --> 01:01:21.271
'Cause crime
is at an all-time high.

01:01:21.313 --> 01:01:22.746
Thank you.

01:01:22.781 --> 01:01:26.581
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's give it up for Meteor Man!

01:01:28.687 --> 01:01:30.484
I must keep my identity
a secret...

01:01:30.522 --> 01:01:33.491
but if you give me
your phone number, I will call.

01:01:33.525 --> 01:01:34.958
'Cause I can tell
with my X-ray vision...

01:01:34.993 --> 01:01:37.656
that you and I
would have a good...

01:01:38.865 --> 01:01:40.457
What?

01:01:42.502 --> 01:01:44.265
Don't you want my number?

01:01:50.575 --> 01:01:51.906
You are so mysterious.

01:01:51.943 --> 01:01:55.140
Yeah, yeah.
Look, baby, I got to go.

01:01:59.818 --> 01:02:02.013
Are you going to fly today?

01:02:02.054 --> 01:02:04.455
No, no,
I don't want to show off.

01:02:04.490 --> 01:02:05.980
I understand.
I don't like flying myself...

01:02:06.025 --> 01:02:08.084
and you...
especially without a plane.

01:02:19.539 --> 01:02:21.370
We could have dinner Thursday.

01:02:26.379 --> 01:02:28.472
What kind of food do you like?

01:02:34.221 --> 01:02:36.951
Hey, Jeff! Hey, it's me... Malik.
How you doing?

01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:38.685
This is my first time
in an inner-city mall.

01:02:38.726 --> 01:02:40.318
Man, this is so clean!

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:42.191
There's no cigarette butts
or anything on the floor.

01:02:42.229 --> 01:02:43.559
Butts?

01:02:46.099 --> 01:02:48.329
- What time do you have?
- Oh, it's about...

01:02:50.336 --> 01:02:52.463
Oh, my God. It's so late.

01:02:55.208 --> 01:02:57.973
I have a hair appointment.
I'm getting dreadlocks put in.

01:02:58.011 --> 01:03:01.139
I know what you want...
trying to feel on me.

01:03:01.181 --> 01:03:03.513
- Stay chilly. Peace, I'm out.
- Chilly.

01:03:10.691 --> 01:03:13.717
I told you he could fly.
You didn't even believe me.

01:03:13.761 --> 01:03:17.993
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's give it up for Meteor Man!

01:03:34.449 --> 01:03:35.609
Love ya!

01:03:36.618 --> 01:03:39.848
I'm Meteor Man!

01:03:43.056 --> 01:03:46.548
I'm sorry.
I was going to tell you.

01:03:46.593 --> 01:03:48.424
I don't want to hear it.
Take off my uniform.

01:03:48.462 --> 01:03:50.191
And I thought I could meet
Janice Farrell.

01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:52.927
Take off my uniform now!

01:03:52.967 --> 01:03:54.798
Jeff, Jeff, just let me...

01:04:06.915 --> 01:04:09.941
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man.

01:04:18.326 --> 01:04:21.353
This thing with the Golden
Lords is getting out of hand.

01:04:21.397 --> 01:04:23.228
Now, last night, they had
the nerve to break in here.

01:04:23.265 --> 01:04:26.428
Let me show you what they did.

01:04:26.468 --> 01:04:27.662
Surprise!

01:04:27.703 --> 01:04:29.432
Meteor Man!

01:04:29.471 --> 01:04:33.668
Let's hear it
for the Meteor Man!

01:04:36.911 --> 01:04:39.812
Jeff, this party
is just a little something...

01:04:39.848 --> 01:04:44.285
to say thank you for making
our community safe again.

01:04:50.826 --> 01:04:52.555
And now that our community
is safe...

01:04:52.595 --> 01:04:54.995
we want to talk to you
about expanding.

01:04:55.030 --> 01:04:56.998
We all have families
in different cities...

01:04:57.032 --> 01:04:58.624
that need your help.

01:04:58.667 --> 01:05:01.727
They don't mind paying
for hotel and food.

01:05:01.770 --> 01:05:03.670
Guess there's no need
for air fare.

01:05:06.375 --> 01:05:07.672
Mrs. Walker...

01:05:29.064 --> 01:05:30.554
Ma?

01:05:39.708 --> 01:05:42.576
I just came by
to give you a message.

01:06:00.063 --> 01:06:01.724
Message...

01:06:01.765 --> 01:06:05.496
you can't be everywhere
and save everybody.

01:06:12.810 --> 01:06:14.141
Let's roll!

01:06:18.149 --> 01:06:20.014
What does that mean?

01:06:21.551 --> 01:06:22.711
Goodness.

01:06:41.472 --> 01:06:42.734
Can I come in?

01:06:42.773 --> 01:06:44.764
Sure.

01:06:44.809 --> 01:06:47.573
You don't have to speak to me.

01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:54.174
I just wanted to say I'm sorry
I acted stupid the other day.

01:06:54.218 --> 01:06:55.617
Can you forgive me?

01:06:57.955 --> 01:07:00.116
Sure, Meteor Man.

01:07:01.859 --> 01:07:03.794
You're losing your powers.

01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:06.593
Something weird's going on.

01:07:06.631 --> 01:07:07.928
I feel sleepy.

01:07:07.966 --> 01:07:11.629
I'm going home early. I don't
know what's happening to me.

01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:13.228
You're just experiencing
the side effects...

01:07:13.271 --> 01:07:15.636
of the meteor deteriorating.

01:07:15.673 --> 01:07:18.141
You'll be fine.
Look at it like this.

01:07:18.175 --> 01:07:25.172
You had a chance to do
what no man could ever do, huh?

01:07:26.884 --> 01:07:29.114
You need to know
you can't flow with the note

01:07:29.154 --> 01:07:31.987
Sucker DJs,
prepare for the death blow

01:07:54.679 --> 01:07:56.112
Thank you, darling.

01:07:56.148 --> 01:07:58.640
We didn't know
which apartment was his.

01:08:05.825 --> 01:08:07.292
Come on.

01:08:43.662 --> 01:08:47.064
Mr. Byers,
what are you doing here?

01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:49.000
Your job.

01:08:49.035 --> 01:08:51.368
I have it under control.

01:08:51.404 --> 01:08:54.169
He's losing his powers.
I got him.

01:08:54.207 --> 01:08:55.675
Well, you better...

01:08:55.709 --> 01:08:58.506
or maybe you're gonna be
losing your powers, too.

01:09:12.658 --> 01:09:15.354
What happened?

01:09:15.394 --> 01:09:17.692
The Golden Lords dropped by
and paid you a visit.

01:09:18.732 --> 01:09:20.165
Why didn't somebody wake me?

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:23.033
We tried, but I figured it out.

01:09:23.069 --> 01:09:25.560
The meteor changed
your molecular cell structure...

01:09:25.606 --> 01:09:26.765
which cause you to sleep more...

01:09:26.807 --> 01:09:28.934
while your powers
are being re-energized.

01:09:28.975 --> 01:09:30.500
That's why you couldn't get up
this morning.

01:09:30.544 --> 01:09:33.569
Any time you use your powers,
it drains you.

01:09:33.613 --> 01:09:35.604
I've been thinking, baby.

01:09:35.649 --> 01:09:38.982
I think you should go away
for a couple of days.

01:09:39.019 --> 01:09:41.852
I couldn't do that. I couldn't
just leave the community.

01:09:41.889 --> 01:09:44.118
Well, nobody's asking you
to run away, Jeff.

01:09:44.158 --> 01:09:46.423
Just, you know, leave town
for a couple of weeks.

01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:51.823
I can't do that.
I got to get dressed.

01:10:23.498 --> 01:10:25.898
Where's everybody at?

01:10:25.934 --> 01:10:27.424
Most of them
are having a meeting...

01:10:27.468 --> 01:10:30.130
in the community center.

01:10:30.171 --> 01:10:32.503
What are we supposed to do...

01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:35.873
just sit around
like sitting ducks...

01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:38.902
and wait till
the gang comes back?

01:10:38.947 --> 01:10:41.644
It was never this bad before.

01:10:41.684 --> 01:10:45.552
They started a war on this
community, and we can't win.

01:10:45.588 --> 01:10:48.523
Yes. We wouldn't be
in this situation...

01:10:48.557 --> 01:10:52.357
if it wasn't for...
Jefferson Reed.

01:10:53.928 --> 01:10:56.658
If we can get him
out of the neighborhood...

01:11:01.102 --> 01:11:03.536
maybe we could make a deal
with the gang.

01:11:05.707 --> 01:11:07.403
Maybe that's what we got to do.

01:11:11.547 --> 01:11:13.208
Let's vote on it.

01:11:13.249 --> 01:11:15.183
All right.

01:11:15.217 --> 01:11:16.878
You don't have to vote.

01:11:18.721 --> 01:11:20.882
I'll leave.

01:11:23.392 --> 01:11:27.351
I'm sorry about what happened
to the neighborhood tonight...

01:11:27.396 --> 01:11:28.693
but I feel even sorrier...

01:11:28.731 --> 01:11:30.892
watching
what's going on in this room.

01:11:30.933 --> 01:11:34.665
How can we stop the crime
and the gangs...

01:11:34.704 --> 01:11:36.672
if we act like
we don't see them?

01:11:38.742 --> 01:11:42.109
Everybody complains
about the police.

01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:45.070
They aren't perfect.

01:11:45.115 --> 01:11:49.016
But how can you complain...

01:11:49.051 --> 01:11:52.214
when you do nothing?

01:11:54.823 --> 01:11:56.984
You don't have to vote.

01:12:09.339 --> 01:12:11.773
We're all guilty, Michael.

01:12:11.808 --> 01:12:14.538
I don't blame them.

01:12:14.577 --> 01:12:16.772
We're all guilty.

01:12:16.813 --> 01:12:20.408
Those powers
gave me something...

01:12:20.450 --> 01:12:22.247
the hero factor.

01:12:23.953 --> 01:12:25.682
No pain...

01:12:25.722 --> 01:12:30.490
so no fear of confrontation...

01:12:30.528 --> 01:12:34.862
and I've never been committed
to anything before in my life.

01:12:37.702 --> 01:12:39.932
To really be a winner...

01:12:41.972 --> 01:12:43.962
you got to lose something.

01:12:47.944 --> 01:12:49.969
Don't be so hard on yourself.

01:13:01.959 --> 01:13:03.927
He's there.

01:13:03.961 --> 01:13:05.758
Trucks! Trucks!

01:13:05.796 --> 01:13:08.959
Trucks!
Put the trucks in position!

01:13:08.999 --> 01:13:12.093
Cut all the phone lines now!

01:13:12.136 --> 01:13:14.104
Put those trucks in position.

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:24.171
Let's do it.

01:13:26.017 --> 01:13:30.215
I just wish I could talk to you
one last time...

01:13:30.255 --> 01:13:32.587
to say thank you.

01:13:39.864 --> 01:13:52.733
Meteor Man!

01:13:55.247 --> 01:13:57.374
Jeff, man,
you can't go down there.

01:13:58.884 --> 01:14:02.547
What am I supposed to do,
hide under the bed?

01:14:02.587 --> 01:14:06.683
No, but you don't have
your superpowers.

01:15:00.847 --> 01:15:03.475
You got a lot of heart.

01:15:03.516 --> 01:15:06.952
I'm sorry what I did
to your neighborhood.

01:15:06.986 --> 01:15:08.817
No more of this.

01:15:10.056 --> 01:15:12.890
You do your thing, Meteor Man.

01:15:12.926 --> 01:15:16.384
I'm going to go to New York.

01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:18.330
Peace.

01:15:43.557 --> 01:15:45.081
Kick his butt!

01:15:46.727 --> 01:15:48.024
Somebody help him!

01:16:39.547 --> 01:16:41.481
Get off me!
I don't need no help!

01:17:19.287 --> 01:17:21.687
Gonna let the boss
punk you, huh?

01:17:27.595 --> 01:17:30.292
Yeah!
Work on his eye, Simon!

01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:53.947
Oh, you mad now, huh?

01:17:57.460 --> 01:17:58.950
You dead, punk!

01:18:19.248 --> 01:18:21.011
Any way you look at it...

01:18:21.050 --> 01:18:24.111
I still got you.

01:18:33.730 --> 01:18:35.789
Get him. Kill him.

01:18:53.117 --> 01:18:54.709
Mr. Moses, get down!

01:19:05.862 --> 01:19:07.454
Are you crazy?

01:19:11.768 --> 01:19:15.033
You broke the golden rule.

01:19:19.543 --> 01:19:22.910
Well, since
you want to save him...

01:19:22.947 --> 01:19:26.007
Golden Lords!

01:19:29.386 --> 01:19:32.184
That was stupid
what you just did!

01:19:35.793 --> 01:19:37.317
What is that?

01:19:37.361 --> 01:19:39.352
Did you do that?

01:19:55.547 --> 01:19:56.707
Did you do that?

01:20:18.003 --> 01:20:19.300
Get off of me!

01:20:37.923 --> 01:20:40.950
Come on! You ain't bad!
You ain't nothin'!

01:20:40.993 --> 01:20:43.461
We don't need to be
doing this, man.

01:20:43.496 --> 01:20:44.986
Look at all this
black-on-black crime.

01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:54.120
Get him!

01:23:18.953 --> 01:23:22.549
This is what I think
of your Meteor Man!

01:23:33.869 --> 01:23:35.631
Get up!

01:23:35.670 --> 01:23:39.231
Get up, Meteor Man.

01:23:39.273 --> 01:23:42.140
I said get up, punk!

01:23:56.125 --> 01:23:57.490
Take him!

01:24:17.047 --> 01:24:20.278
Take him, Larry! Take him out!

01:24:20.316 --> 01:24:23.217
Show him, kung fu master Larry.
Show him, Larry.

01:24:23.253 --> 01:24:24.652
Do it! Work him, Larry!

01:24:24.687 --> 01:24:26.985
Get him, Larry!
Kung fu master Larry!

01:24:27.023 --> 01:24:28.354
Do it. Do it, Larry.

01:24:28.391 --> 01:24:30.824
Stop dancing, Larry!
Finish him off!

01:24:34.730 --> 01:24:36.322
What is this?

01:24:37.699 --> 01:24:40.566
You all right, Larry?

01:24:40.602 --> 01:24:42.297
Where you going?

01:24:42.337 --> 01:24:44.636
What's up with that?

01:24:44.674 --> 01:24:46.073
Digit!

01:24:46.109 --> 01:24:50.739
Meteor Man! Come here!

01:25:21.779 --> 01:25:25.009
Thirty seconds. Damn!

01:25:27.283 --> 01:25:30.912
Come on. Come on!

01:25:30.954 --> 01:25:32.888
I got him, Goldie. I got him.

01:25:39.630 --> 01:25:41.791
"Runway modeling"?

01:26:12.864 --> 01:26:14.491
What's wrong with your man?

01:26:14.533 --> 01:26:17.331
My man? L-l-l...

01:26:17.369 --> 01:26:20.826
Don't touch my hair!

01:26:20.871 --> 01:26:23.169
Thirty seconds.

01:26:23.207 --> 01:26:25.573
Thank God!

01:26:31.015 --> 01:26:33.678
That's what I'm talking about.

01:26:33.718 --> 01:26:35.310
He's bad.

01:26:41.226 --> 01:26:44.753
Meteor Man.

01:27:22.334 --> 01:27:27.602
Now the world
will do what I say!

01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:29.039
Shoot me!

01:27:33.179 --> 01:27:36.307
Wait. Wait a minute. What?

01:27:36.349 --> 01:27:39.318
Shoot me!

01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:59.034
Yeah, boy!

01:27:59.072 --> 01:28:05.841
I will be God on this planet!

01:28:05.879 --> 01:28:08.039
Hey, Golden Lords, baby!

01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:10.708
I want to meet
with all the world leaders.

01:28:10.750 --> 01:28:12.741
Simon, look!

01:28:22.562 --> 01:28:24.928
Show's over.

01:28:24.965 --> 01:28:27.399
Says who?

01:28:27.434 --> 01:28:30.801
Says Meteor Man.

01:28:38.779 --> 01:28:40.542
Get him, baby!

01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:42.241
Knock him out!

01:29:12.312 --> 01:29:14.678
He can't do that to Simon.
Who do he think he is?

01:29:14.715 --> 01:29:16.479
We got to do something.
He can't beat us all up.

01:29:16.517 --> 01:29:17.677
Come on.

01:29:19.454 --> 01:29:21.979
Time to get that butt kicked.

01:29:23.358 --> 01:29:24.552
You want some
of the Meteor Man?

01:29:24.592 --> 01:29:26.753
You want some of me?
Huh? Huh?

01:29:26.794 --> 01:29:28.989
We'll see you again,
Meteor Man!

01:29:33.634 --> 01:29:35.465
Baby Lords.

01:29:53.021 --> 01:29:54.852
I'm gonna get you, Meteor Man!

01:30:23.285 --> 01:30:27.881
I'm losing my powers again.

01:32:18.469 --> 01:32:21.802
Hey, Meteor Man.

01:32:21.839 --> 01:32:25.866
Finally I get to meet
Meteor Man, man.

01:32:25.910 --> 01:32:28.607
Oh, you really...

01:32:28.647 --> 01:32:32.981
you really have given me
a lot of grief.

01:32:33.018 --> 01:32:36.510
I just had to be here.

01:32:36.555 --> 01:32:40.991
I'm really going to enjoy this.

01:32:54.372 --> 01:32:56.397
What the hell is...

01:33:01.346 --> 01:33:04.247
Check this out.
Y'all better leave him alone.

01:33:04.282 --> 01:33:06.216
Looks like all of you...

01:33:06.251 --> 01:33:10.483
are gonna be taking a vacation
along with Meteor Man.

01:33:10.522 --> 01:33:12.353
Have a nice trip.

01:33:12.390 --> 01:33:15.223
Maybe you should think about
taking a little vacation.

01:33:15.260 --> 01:33:18.752
What? What?

01:33:24.303 --> 01:33:27.602
What? What is that? What is...

01:33:45.223 --> 01:33:48.091
l... I could take a vacation.

01:33:48.127 --> 01:33:51.790
Why didn't I think of that?
This is a perfect time for it.

01:33:51.831 --> 01:33:53.458
Maybe I'll go to the Bahamas.
That's it.

01:33:53.499 --> 01:33:55.967
Yeah. Wait for me.

01:33:57.336 --> 01:34:00.533
- Thanks.
- Anytime you need us, man.
