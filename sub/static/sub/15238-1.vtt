You can stay here tonight.

20:54.378 --> 20:57.348
No, no, I have to get home

Look, if you think I'm leavin'
here at 3:30 in the morning

21:00.009 --> 21:02.182
to take you wherever
the hell home is, you're crazy.

21:03.137 --> 21:04.389
Oh, you'd better take me

21:04.472 --> 21:07.021
or I'll walk out of here

21:07.641 --> 21:08.858

sounds like something, doesn't it?

40:09.949 --> 40:12.748
You're forgetting I'm a hell
of a lot older than you are kid.

40:12.827 --> 40:14.467
Hey, there are plenty
of guys twice my age

40:14.495 --> 40:16.042
who don't know their ass
from a hole in the ground.

40:16.122 --> 40:17.749
I won't fault you there.

40:17.832 --> 40:19.254
In for a penny, in for a pound.

40:19.334 --> 40:21.962
So, who are these guys
that are following us?

40:22.045 --> 40:23.342
Oh...

40:24.672 --> 40:27.596
The big dude's a war hero.

40:27.675 --> 40:31.020
His name's Red Leary.
Saved my life once in Korea.

40:31.095 --> 40:35.316
He was sent to prison in Illinois
later on for stabbing a woman.

40:35.391 --> 40:38.486
There he met an old-time bank
robber, named Billy Lamb.

40:38.561 --> 40:40.279
Lamb taught him
how to break safes.

40:42.023 --> 40:44.367
Lamb was a real
genius for organization.

40:45.193 --> 40:46.695
Thanks.

40:49.113 --> 40:51.707
When they got out,
Lamb introduced him to Dunlop,

40:51.783 --> 40:54.036
Dunlop's an electronics
expert or was.

40:54.118 --> 40:56.416
That's the guy you took
care of in the field.

40:59.332 --> 41:01.300
- Wanna brew?
- Definitely.

41:01.376 --> 41:04.971
The little Orphan Annie-eyed
character's Eddie Goody.

41:06.381 --> 41:08.600
He's a driver.
He's harmless when he's alone.

41:08.675 --> 41:10.052
So, what happened to the money?

41:11.135 --> 41:13.558
Hey, I don't care anything about
the money, you know that.

41:15.223 --> 41:17.476
We're friends, right?
I like you as a friend.

41:17.558 --> 41:19.060
Yeah.

41:21.688 --> 41:25.363
Oh, we hid it in a one-room
schoolhouse in Warsaw, Montana.

41:25.441 --> 41:27.660
A place Lamb went to
when he was a kid.

41:29.112 --> 41:31.786
Hid it in the wall
right behind the blackboard.

41:31.864 --> 41:34.208
Half a million dollars-worth.
It's still there.

41:34.283 --> 41:35.455
Schoolhouse?

41:35.535 --> 41:36.787
Right behind the blackboard.

41:36.869 --> 41:37.916
Why?

41:39.914 --> 41:41.837
Well, it was always Lamb's
practice to control the money

41:41.916 --> 41:43.418
till the final split.

41:44.544 --> 41:45.905
We kept in contact
with each other

41:45.920 --> 41:47.342
through personals
in the newspaper.

41:48.631 --> 41:50.725
Then Lamb had a heart
attack and died.

41:50.800 --> 41:52.894
Guess he was just too old for it.

41:52.969 --> 41:54.767
Leary got suspicious
but I wasn't about to tell him

41:54.846 --> 41:57.019
where the hell the money was,

41:57.098 --> 41:59.772
because I knew he'd go straight
to it, heat or no heat.

42:02.854 --> 42:06.358
Well, then the police
released a thing in the press

42:06.441 --> 42:08.364
saying that the money
had been found.

42:08.443 --> 42:09.786
Bullshit.

42:09.861 --> 42:11.283
Leary went off his ass.

42:12.947 --> 42:15.575
He got careless but he couldn't
lead them to the money

42:15.658 --> 42:17.378
'cause he didn't know
where the hell it was.

42:19.620 --> 42:22.965
Finally, they arrested and convicted
him on another bank robbery

42:23.041 --> 42:24.793
that took place
several years before.

42:26.044 --> 42:28.638
And when he got out he convinced
the others I'd set him up.

42:29.756 --> 42:32.760
I decided best that I should
drop out for a while.

42:35.762 --> 42:37.242
That church was a
pretty far-out idea.

42:37.305 --> 42:38.932
Hmm.

42:39.015 --> 42:42.064
About as far out as possible,
I thought.

42:44.437 --> 42:45.529
Fuck!

43:00.745 --> 43:02.247
(CHILDREN SCREAMING)

43:26.145 --> 43:27.613
Are you sure this is the spot?

43:29.148 --> 43:30.525
Yeah.

43:30.608 --> 43:32.360
What?
I didn't hear what you said.

43:32.443 --> 43:33.945
I said, yeah, this is it.

43:38.199 --> 43:39.371
Well, what happened to it?

43:41.035 --> 43:43.538
I don't know. Progress.

44:02.056 --> 44:03.729
(TAPS FLAGPOLE)

44:14.694 --> 44:15.911
Have a nice day, boy.

44:18.531 --> 44:19.953
Here, for you.

44:20.741 --> 44:22.163
That's the last of our money.

44:25.079 --> 44:26.331
It's good.

44:27.206 --> 44:28.207
Real good.

44:55.651 --> 44:56.994
Fantastic pistachio.

44:59.363 --> 45:00.535
What do we do now?

45:01.365 --> 45:03.413
Drop your cocks and
reach for your socks.

45:05.870 --> 45:07.713
Don't look at me.
I didn't say a word.

45:08.956 --> 45:10.128
- Red?
- Start the car.

45:12.376 --> 45:13.593
Freeze, you son of a bitch.

45:13.669 --> 45:15.171
The first one of
you moves I shoot.

45:18.758 --> 45:20.977
(ENGINE REVVING)

45:51.540 --> 45:53.634
All right, kill the engine.

45:53.709 --> 45:55.382
Hand me the keys and
don't turn around.

45:59.173 --> 46:01.392
Now, both of you get out
of Pistachio's side.

46:01.467 --> 46:04.016
No ideas, you'll both be dead
before you hit the ground.

46:05.513 --> 46:06.560
Move it.

46:19.235 --> 46:20.657
Turn around.

46:23.489 --> 46:24.706
The guy's in the car.

46:26.075 --> 46:27.702
That's it, smartass.

46:29.120 --> 46:30.713
Red. Goody.

46:32.331 --> 46:33.799
How's Dunlop?

46:33.874 --> 46:35.376
That's for us to know
and you to find out.

46:35.501 --> 46:36.627
Shut up, Goody.

46:39.880 --> 46:41.001
Well, what do you want, Red?

46:41.048 --> 46:42.300
What do I want?

46:43.217 --> 46:44.764
You got balls.
I'll say that for you, Johnny.

46:44.844 --> 46:47.438
I want your ass, that's what
I want, my friend.

get you guys anywhere.

46:56.272 --> 46:57.273
- No.
- Yeah.

He'd be dead now.

a high opinion of yourself, Red.

preaching lately, Johnny?

in the schoolhouse.

everybody was lying.

49:10.156 --> 49:12.124
They were working with the police.

49:12.199 --> 49:13.542
When Lamb died I...

49:14.326 --> 49:15.327
I never came back here.

49:15.411 --> 49:16.754
The money's still here.
It's safe.

49:16.829 --> 49:17.921
Here?

49:18.873 --> 49:21.968
Yeah. Lamb went
to school here in Warsaw,

49:22.042 --> 49:23.794
a little one-room schoolhouse.

49:23.878 --> 49:26.802
We put the money in the wall,
behind the blackboard.

49:26.881 --> 49:28.554
Where's this one-room schoolhouse?

49:29.717 --> 49:30.809
Gone.

Gone? Gone where?

believe all this crap?

as a stake to operate with?

dwell with the lamb

Dunlop monitored the frequency
of the signal on the wire.

ran it back into the circuit

hear an alarm go off.

runs right through the telegraph lines.

I'm sure of that.

(SIGHS)

01:12:08.366 --> 01:12:09.868
Now, the big risk,
of course being is

01:12:09.951 --> 01:12:12.875
if they've run a hard wire into someplace
else, like the Sheriff's office.

01:12:12.954 --> 01:12:14.046
How far away is that?

01:12:14.121 --> 01:12:17.170
I clocked that on the truck
doing 40 miles per hour.

01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:22.177
Now, if the police come down on us hard,
say, at an average of 80 miles an hour,

01:12:22.255 --> 01:12:24.974
I figure we're seven
minutes on the inside,

01:12:25.049 --> 01:12:28.428
10 minutes on the outside,
depending on which route they take.

01:12:28.511 --> 01:12:30.513
However, I think to
be absolutely sure

01:12:30.596 --> 01:12:33.725
that we should use five
minutes as our bottom line

01:12:33.808 --> 01:12:36.061

the alarm inside the vault.

in the alley behind the Liberty Lounge.

01:12:57.456 --> 01:12:58.548

You stay right there until
11:30, in the can. Understand?

01:13:08.968 --> 01:13:11.687
At 11:30, you climb out of there
and you get into the telegraph office.

01:13:11.762 --> 01:13:13.389
You got to get in
there before 11:35,

01:13:13.472 --> 01:13:15.019
because that's when
the alarm goes off.

01:13:16.267 --> 01:13:18.486
Now, you'll see a light
light up on the console.

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:21.314

how you get inside.
