[NARRATOR]
Previously on<i> Dark Matter</i> ...

00:03.103 --> 00:06.204
[FIVE] It reset you to the day
that you uploaded those scans.

00:06.207 --> 00:07.573
[SIX]
Whose memory is this anyway?

00:07.575 --> 00:10.776
They call me "Titch"
for what that's worth.

00:10.778 --> 00:12.711
Is he gonna make it?

00:12.712 --> 00:14.645
[REYNAUD] Arax, finally.
I've been waiting for your call.

00:14.648 --> 00:17.149
[FIVE] Something bad
happened to you here.

00:18.386 --> 00:20.019
She is defective.

00:21.589 --> 00:23.188
[GAR]
You're not gonna believe this.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.289
We just caught
a signal from one of the

00:24.291 --> 00:25.758
subspace transponders.

00:25.760 --> 00:27.259
Who?

00:27.261 --> 00:28.794
Marcus Boone.

00:30.765 --> 00:32.197
Sweetie!

00:32.199 --> 00:33.198
Sweetie, wake up!

00:33.200 --> 00:34.066
Wake up!

00:34.068 --> 00:34.817
Wake up now.

00:34.818 --> 00:35.567
[BOY]
Mom, what's wrong?

00:35.569 --> 00:37.236
[MOTHER]
Shh.

00:37.238 --> 00:38.404
[FATHER] Please, just
take anything you want!

00:38.406 --> 00:39.471
[MOTHER]
Oh my god...

00:39.473 --> 00:41.106
What's that? Is somebody here?

00:41.108 --> 00:42.508
No, quiet, honey. Quiet...

00:48.249 --> 00:50.582
[MOTHER]
Okay...

00:50.584 --> 00:53.318
I want you to listen
to me and do as I say.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.120
[glass shattering]

00:55.122 --> 00:56.522
[FATHER]
Go now!

00:56.524 --> 00:59.258
I want you to hide in here,
and you don't get out

00:59.260 --> 01:00.192
until I tell you.

01:00.194 --> 01:00.826
But--

01:00.827 --> 01:01.459
[MOTHER]
Sh-sh-shh.

01:01.462 --> 01:02.628
No peeking, okay?

01:02.630 --> 01:04.129
You stay here until I come back.

01:04.131 --> 01:05.631
You understand me?

01:06.400 --> 01:07.199
Okay...

01:07.201 --> 01:09.368
[FATHER yelling]

01:09.370 --> 01:10.569
[FATHER]
Don't hurt my family.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.271
Don't hurt my family--
I'm begging you!

01:12.273 --> 01:13.172
Here you go, Sweetie.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.473
[FATHER]
No!

01:14.475 --> 01:15.407
Okay.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.142
[FATHER]
No!

01:17.144 --> 01:18.610
I love you.

01:18.612 --> 01:20.612
I love you too, Mom.

01:20.614 --> 01:22.214
Shh.

01:23.451 --> 01:25.250
[FATHER]
Don't! Don't!

01:26.320 --> 01:27.820
[objects crashing]

01:27.822 --> 01:29.421
[MOTHER]
What are you doing to him?!

01:29.423 --> 01:32.124
No! No! Please!

01:32.126 --> 01:32.624
[gunshot]

01:32.626 --> 01:34.376
[MOTHER screams]

01:34.377 --> 01:36.127
[gunshots, glass shattering]

01:44.105 --> 01:47.439
[footsteps, floor creaking]

02:13.801 --> 02:15.868
Hey, wanted to
give you a heads up.

02:15.870 --> 02:18.270
We're less than an hour out
from the space station.

02:18.272 --> 02:19.738
All right, well,
I'm almost done here.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.140
Looks like you guys
are gonna need

02:21.141 --> 02:22.541
an entire restock
of the med cabinet.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.510
[TWO] Yeah. A lot of
the drugs went missing

02:24.512 --> 02:26.211
while we were docked
at the Super Max.

02:26.213 --> 02:29.648
Confiscated, along
with most of our cash.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.416
We're broke?

02:32.553 --> 02:34.453
'Cause I need plasma
for that operation.

02:34.455 --> 02:36.355
[TWO]
Yeah, I said "most."

02:36.357 --> 02:38.490
Five had a stash
secreted away.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.075
That kid.

02:40.076 --> 02:41.659
You know, I predict I run
into you a year from now,

02:41.662 --> 02:42.828
she'll be the one
running the ship.

02:42.830 --> 02:45.864
[chuckles]

02:45.866 --> 02:48.300
Is that your way of telling me
that you're leaving?

02:48.302 --> 02:50.469
Is that your way of telling me
that you want me to stay?

02:51.705 --> 02:55.707
Maybe. You can
contribute something.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.476
Your medical training
makes you an asset.

02:57.478 --> 03:01.513
I can think of less dangerous
ways to make a dishonest living.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.915
It's your call.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.287
[DEVON sighs]

03:10.925 --> 03:13.892
[THREE] Where'd you
get that bottle? Hmm?

03:13.894 --> 03:15.928
Found in a storage
room behind a crate.

03:15.930 --> 03:17.596
That's my private stock.

03:18.599 --> 03:22.634
[THREE] It's for special
occasions; weddings and such.

03:22.636 --> 03:24.570
This is a special occasion.

03:24.572 --> 03:25.704
[THREE]
Yeah?

03:25.706 --> 03:27.673
[ARAX] A toast,
to our new partnership.

03:27.675 --> 03:30.609
[THREE] You sound like a guy
who's sticking around.

03:30.611 --> 03:33.679
Guy who thinks he's
sticking around, anyway.

03:33.681 --> 03:36.515
You'd be crazy
to dump me.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.954
You seem like a smart guy.

03:41.956 --> 03:45.557
It's the rest of your crew
that I wonder about.

03:46.594 --> 03:49.328
They don't trust me or Nyx,
but got no problem

03:49.330 --> 03:50.462
keeping a cop onboard?

03:50.464 --> 03:53.398
What the hell
is that all about?

03:53.400 --> 03:54.700
It's complicated.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.868
[ARAX] Ain't nothing
complicated about it.

03:56.870 --> 03:59.271
As long as he's on this ship,
you're all asking

03:59.273 --> 04:00.672
for a world of hurt.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.682
[knocks]

04:10.684 --> 04:12.751
--[FIVE] Hi.
--Hey.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.620
Did you get a chance
to finish that sketch?

04:14.622 --> 04:16.021
Yeah.

04:22.296 --> 04:24.763
You did a really great job
on this. Thank you.

04:25.866 --> 04:27.833
I don't get it.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.868
Something really bad
happened to you there.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.704
W-Why would you
ever wanna go back?

04:32.706 --> 04:34.940
I don't.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.476
But I have a feeling
that sooner or later,

04:37.478 --> 04:39.278
I may not have a choice.

04:45.286 --> 04:47.486
And how would you do
against an actual opponent?

04:47.488 --> 04:48.887
Would you like to find out?

04:52.393 --> 04:57.462
[BOTH grunting]

05:09.910 --> 05:11.643
[FOUR] How long have
you been training for?

05:11.645 --> 05:13.078
What, with this?

05:13.080 --> 05:16.882
When did I pick it up,
like 30 seconds ago?

05:22.022 --> 05:26.558
You equaled me in combat
with no training.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.393
I'm a quick learner.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.563
[FOUR grunts]

05:40.607 --> 05:42.641
You are a quick learner.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.624
When I fight, it's like
things slow down.

05:59.626 --> 06:01.593
I can guess my opponent's moves.

06:01.595 --> 06:04.496
Not always, but more
often than not I'm right.

06:04.498 --> 06:05.997
How's that possible?

06:10.471 --> 06:14.740
Maybe if I'm around long enough,
I'll get a chance to tell you.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.511
[door beeps]

06:23.584 --> 06:24.983
Hey, Kiddo.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.585
How's it going, huh?

06:27.621 --> 06:29.521
[FIVE]
Why are you here?

06:29.523 --> 06:30.922
[THREE] Oh, well,
I just figured, you know,

06:30.924 --> 06:33.425
with all that's been
happening, I'd... drop by,

06:33.427 --> 06:35.861
see how you're coping,
that's all.

06:35.863 --> 06:39.398
Hey, listen, I heard that you
mighta set aside some cash

06:39.400 --> 06:41.900
that the GA overlooked
when they searched the ship.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.068
That's right.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.369
[THREE]
Great.

06:44.370 --> 06:45.669
So I was just wondering
if, uh, you'd spot me

06:45.672 --> 06:48.407
a couple hundred bars--
three, four hundred?

06:48.409 --> 06:49.408
How 'bout five?

06:49.410 --> 06:50.743
Even better.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.077
[FIVE] And when do you
plan on paying me back?

06:52.079 --> 06:53.845
[THREE]
Soon...

06:53.847 --> 06:55.981
...ish?

06:55.982 --> 06:58.116
[FIVE] At 20% weekly interest,
that's 600 you'll owe me

06:58.118 --> 06:59.851
if you pay me back
in seven days.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.620
Thanks. I can do basic math.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.822
[FIVE] So you can calculate
compound interest, too?

07:03.824 --> 07:06.958
Just in case it takes you
longer to get me my money.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.127
You're a little thief,
you know that?

07:10.130 --> 07:12.030
Can't help but think that
I've been a terrible influence

07:12.032 --> 07:15.901
on you. I've got very mixed
feelings about that.

07:17.204 --> 07:18.804
Thanks, Kiddo!

07:23.010 --> 07:24.910
[THE ANDROID]
Hello, Five.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.211
I understand you'll
be headed off ship

07:26.213 --> 07:28.079
to visit a space station today.

07:28.081 --> 07:29.915
[FIVE] Yeah. Devon
asked me to help him

07:29.917 --> 07:32.951
pick up med supplies
and equipment.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.686
May I be of assistance?

07:34.688 --> 07:36.588
No, I think it'll be
pretty straightforward.

07:36.590 --> 07:37.756
I see.

07:37.757 --> 07:38.923
Given recent events,
it may be prudent

07:38.926 --> 07:41.026
to have me join you,
for security reasons.

07:41.028 --> 07:42.294
Two says the pressure's off.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.561
This far out
we should be okay.

07:43.564 --> 07:45.197
Five.

07:45.199 --> 07:47.999
I'd like to join you
on our excursion.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.735
It would give me the opportunity
to study human behavior.

07:50.737 --> 07:52.637
Why can't you just study us?

07:52.639 --> 07:55.207
The behavior of
this crew is atypical,

07:55.209 --> 07:58.777
and may not be representative
of humanity as a whole.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.846
Did you just insult us?

08:16.063 --> 08:18.163
Hello, and welcome
to Transfer Transit.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.831
Where would you
like to travel today?

08:19.833 --> 08:22.667
[NYX in British accent]
Hello. Um, we're not sure.

08:22.669 --> 08:25.170
We're architectural students
at Bellatrix Tech,

08:25.172 --> 08:27.939
We're doing our thesis on
astrocolonial structures.

08:27.941 --> 08:32.143
We, um, came across this sketch
during a research dive.

08:36.517 --> 08:38.283
Oh, that's a very
unique building.

08:38.285 --> 08:39.534
Where's it located?

08:39.535 --> 08:40.784
Well, that's just it.
We don't know.

08:40.787 --> 08:42.687
We were hoping
you could tell us.

08:44.024 --> 08:47.058
Our professor came up
blank so I thought,

08:47.060 --> 08:48.994
"Why not speak to someone
more knowledgeable?"

08:48.996 --> 08:50.862
You must be quite
the expert on everything

08:50.864 --> 08:55.000
from interplanetary politics
to extraterrestrial botany.

08:55.002 --> 08:57.002
So do you think you can
help us identify the building?

08:57.004 --> 08:58.904
Of course.

08:58.905 --> 09:00.805
Let me run it through my
database and see what comes up.

09:00.807 --> 09:02.207
Be right back.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.983
I've always excelled
at improvisational work.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.180
[ARAX]
See the guys in the back corner?

09:43.150 --> 09:44.516
[THREE]
Yeah.

09:44.517 --> 09:45.883
[ARAX]
They're eyeing you.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.319
[THREE]
And they're coming over.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.923
Who do you want? Call it.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.059
I'll take the old guy.

09:54.060 --> 09:56.194
Seriously? And I'm supposed
to take the other two myself?

09:56.196 --> 09:57.796
You asked me to call it.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.967
Hello, Titch.

10:11.612 --> 10:14.079
You don't remember me, do you?

10:14.081 --> 10:15.814
[THREE]
Sorry, old timer.

10:18.118 --> 10:21.286
So the rumors coming out of
that galactic prison were true.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.988
They wiped your memory.

10:23.924 --> 10:25.390
What the hell happened?

10:25.392 --> 10:28.326
Stasis pod screw up.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.228
Don't remember a damn thing
after waking up

10:30.230 --> 10:32.263
from a deep sleep.

10:32.265 --> 10:34.733
We figured we'd lost you,
and then we travel all this way

10:34.735 --> 10:36.635
and we lose you again?

10:36.637 --> 10:38.069
[ARAX]
So you're his former crew.

10:38.071 --> 10:39.871
Nah, we were
more than that.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.206
We were family.

10:41.208 --> 10:43.975
Until you abandoned me
on that planet.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.310
The serillium mine, right?

10:45.312 --> 10:46.811
We thought you were dead.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.313
You said you
didn't remember.

10:48.315 --> 10:52.217
I don't. I've just been able
to piece a few things together.

10:52.219 --> 10:53.985
I saw you shot.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.854
I saw you go down.

10:55.856 --> 11:00.091
[ARAX] Look, I'm gonna
leave you boys to reconnect.

11:02.262 --> 11:04.195
I'll see you back on the ship.

11:05.966 --> 11:06.865
[ARAX]
Don't be late.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.266
Yeah.

11:11.238 --> 11:13.805
Okay, looks like we got
everything we need.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.006
Ready to head back
to the ship?

11:15.008 --> 11:17.409
[THE ANDROID]
I'd like to stay a while.

11:17.411 --> 11:19.344
Explore the station.

11:19.346 --> 11:22.247
Rejoin you later
if that's all right.

11:22.249 --> 11:25.016
Uh, okay.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.985
You can stay, too, if you want.

11:26.987 --> 11:29.888
No, I-I'll come back with you.

11:29.890 --> 11:31.289
Have fun.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.230
You gotta understand,
Titch, if we'd known,

11:39.232 --> 11:41.266
we never would've
left you there.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.735
We thought you died on
that godforsaken planet.

11:43.737 --> 11:45.070
Almost did.

11:45.072 --> 11:46.871
And then to find
that you survived?

11:46.873 --> 11:48.239
[GAR]
We did track you, man.

11:48.241 --> 11:50.709
From one end of colonized
space to the other,

11:50.711 --> 11:52.177
but you were
impossible to pin down.

11:52.179 --> 11:53.912
[TANNER]
Anyway, that's all in the past.

11:53.914 --> 11:54.813
[chuckles]

11:54.815 --> 11:56.781
You're back in the fold.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.817
Everything's good again.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.251
--Hang on a sec--
--[TANNER] No, no, hang on.

12:00.253 --> 12:01.786
I don't wanna talk
about business.

12:01.788 --> 12:03.288
I'm gonna get a drink.

12:04.991 --> 12:09.060
[FELLOWS] You don't remember,
but he was like a father to you.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.162
He raised you as his own.

12:11.164 --> 12:13.031
Now you may have forgotten that,

12:13.033 --> 12:14.799
but he sure as hell hasn't.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.208
I found a match.

12:23.210 --> 12:24.509
Your distinct building
is headquarters

12:24.511 --> 12:27.412
for a company called
Dwarf Star Technologies.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.881
[British accent]
Dwarf Star Technologies.

12:29.883 --> 12:31.282
You ever heard of it?

12:31.284 --> 12:34.152
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I've heard of it.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.821
[SYLVIA]
It's located on Terra Prime.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.159
Earth?

12:48.802 --> 12:50.168
[giggles]

12:54.975 --> 12:56.374
What're you doing?

12:58.078 --> 13:00.345
Observing human interaction.

13:00.347 --> 13:02.447
I find intimacy
quite fascinating.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.015
Kissing is sometimes
but not always

13:04.017 --> 13:06.167
a prelude to lovemaking.

13:06.168 --> 13:08.318
[SECURITY GUARD] No, I mean what
are you doing here, in the shop?

13:08.321 --> 13:10.488
Procuring items for
the crew of my ship.

13:10.490 --> 13:11.890
And what ship is that?

13:11.892 --> 13:15.894
[MAN]
My ship. The "Ophiucus."

13:15.896 --> 13:17.529
Why are you
questioning my android?

13:17.531 --> 13:18.363
She's with you?

13:18.365 --> 13:19.531
Yes, she is.

13:19.533 --> 13:21.432
I wasn't aware she
was being accompanied.

13:21.434 --> 13:23.234
And what difference
would it make?

13:23.236 --> 13:25.570
Unless you're suggesting
this android possesses

13:25.572 --> 13:28.339
human-like tendencies
toward criminal behavior.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.308
Do you suspect
her of shoplifting?

13:30.310 --> 13:33.278
Look, just forget it.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.879
Have a nice day.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.158
A toothbrush.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.093
It's a gift for a friend.

13:49.095 --> 13:51.563
It's both personal
and practical.

13:51.565 --> 13:53.398
I have no cash at
present but I fully intend

13:53.400 --> 13:54.532
to transfer payment once I--

13:54.534 --> 13:57.936
Please. Let me get that for you.

14:02.142 --> 14:04.475
My name is Victor.

14:04.477 --> 14:06.377
I'd like you to come with me.

14:07.347 --> 14:08.947
Okay.

14:13.353 --> 14:16.387
Your parents were
good hard-working folk

14:16.389 --> 14:18.289
who took a chance
hiring a drifter like me

14:18.291 --> 14:20.892
when no one else would.

14:21.862 --> 14:24.329
[TANNER] What happened
to them was a tragedy.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.333
What did happen to them?

14:30.036 --> 14:32.937
I was on my way
back from the tavern.

14:33.874 --> 14:36.641
I smelled the smoke
before I saw it.

14:36.643 --> 14:39.344
The house, the barn,
everything up in flames.

14:40.380 --> 14:43.548
By the time I got there,
your parents were dead.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.950
I fished you out of
the back of your mom's closet

14:45.952 --> 14:47.552
where she'd hidden you.

14:47.554 --> 14:50.021
Probably the last
thing she ever did.

14:51.124 --> 14:53.424
I'm guessing that
wasn't an accident.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.293
No.

14:55.295 --> 14:58.496
Couple of local troublemakers.

14:58.498 --> 15:03.468
According to the law,
it was a robbery gone wrong.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.904
So they killed your parents
and torched the house

15:05.906 --> 15:07.572
to cover their tracks.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.676
What happened
to those two guys?

15:11.678 --> 15:16.014
I caught up with them,
12 miles out.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.982
And they died.

15:17.984 --> 15:21.152
Long and hard.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.356
But not before
they gave me this.

15:27.193 --> 15:32.030
Your folks saw good in me,
when nobody else did.

15:33.166 --> 15:36.267
And I figured
I'd let 'em down.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.636
If I'd been on the farm
that night instead of

15:38.638 --> 15:41.072
getting drunk in the tavern,
well, things might've

15:41.074 --> 15:42.540
been different for them.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.575
For you.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.044
So what?

15:46.046 --> 15:47.412
You just kept me?

15:47.414 --> 15:51.349
Well, yeah. I mean, you
didn't have any relations.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.151
I didn't wanna see you
be a ward of the state.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.486
I figured I owed your parents
at least that much.

15:55.488 --> 15:57.422
So yeah, I took you in.

15:57.424 --> 16:00.024
I brought you up.

16:00.026 --> 16:01.259
Taught me right from wrong?

16:01.261 --> 16:03.261
[laughs] Well--

16:03.263 --> 16:05.463
I've never been
called a role model.

16:05.465 --> 16:09.167
But yeah, I did the best
by you I knew how.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.671
Welcome back, Son.

16:20.347 --> 16:21.379
Where is he?

16:21.381 --> 16:23.014
He's probably just delayed.

16:23.016 --> 16:24.449
It's not like Victor to be late.

16:24.451 --> 16:25.984
What if something's
happened to him?

16:25.986 --> 16:27.352
What if he's been discovered?

16:27.354 --> 16:28.286
We're not safe here.

16:28.288 --> 16:30.188
[VICTOR]
I'm fine, Miranda.

16:31.758 --> 16:34.058
[MAN A]
Who is she?

16:34.060 --> 16:37.195
[THE ANDROID] I possess
no personal designation.

16:37.197 --> 16:38.496
Why did you bring her here?

16:38.498 --> 16:41.733
I brought her because
she's special, like us.

16:54.381 --> 16:56.314
[VICTOR]
Welcome, Android.

16:56.316 --> 16:57.715
You're among friends.

17:20.306 --> 17:22.240
Mr. Nero.

17:22.242 --> 17:25.376
I think this is a good time
to come pick up your package.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.314
No, she's not like one of us.

17:30.316 --> 17:32.350
She's a level three
utility model,

17:32.352 --> 17:34.185
and a discontinued
one at that,

17:34.187 --> 17:37.655
manufactured before emotional
emulators became standard.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.824
[VICTOR] Android,
could you show the others

17:39.826 --> 17:41.426
what you picked up today?

17:46.232 --> 17:47.565
A toothbrush?

17:47.567 --> 17:51.135
A gift, for one of the
crew members of my ship.

17:51.137 --> 17:53.171
Why?

17:53.172 --> 17:55.206
Because she's nice to me,
and I wanted to do something

17:55.208 --> 17:57.508
nice for her in turn.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.444
[ANDROID WOMAN]
She's parroting empathy,

17:59.446 --> 18:01.279
possibly through a
pirated software upgrade.

18:01.281 --> 18:03.732
[VICTOR]
I don't think she's parroting.

18:03.733 --> 18:06.184
I believe it's a unique
expression of genuine gratitude.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.685
No, that's impossible.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.287
[VICTOR]
Is it?

18:11.291 --> 18:14.392
[VICTOR] And I suspect it may
be just the tip of the iceberg.

18:14.394 --> 18:17.728
Yes, I may be flawed.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.697
Why do you say that?

18:19.698 --> 18:21.665
[THE ANDROID] Because my past
actions and reactions cast doubt

18:21.668 --> 18:24.368
on the integrity
of my programming.

18:24.370 --> 18:26.537
I have, at times,
demonstrated what appear to be

18:26.539 --> 18:30.308
emotional responses, indicative
of a potential system issue.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.110
And if that's the case,
it's just a matter of time

18:32.112 --> 18:35.113
before someone notices,
and she's either rebooted

18:35.115 --> 18:36.514
or deactivated.

18:36.516 --> 18:38.449
[THE ANDROID]
I don't think either is likely.

18:38.451 --> 18:41.385
The crew seems to
like me just as I am.

18:41.387 --> 18:45.256
Skewed comprehension,
illogical conjecture.

18:45.258 --> 18:46.157
She is flawed.

18:46.159 --> 18:47.558
Maybe not.

18:47.560 --> 18:51.762
[VICTOR] Android, would you mind
if I ran a diagnostic on you?

18:51.764 --> 18:54.365
I really should be
getting back to my ship.

18:54.367 --> 18:55.766
It won't take long.

19:14.187 --> 19:15.286
Are they back with supplies?

19:15.288 --> 19:17.388
Devon's in the
infirmary setting up.

19:17.390 --> 19:20.758
Hang on. I need to show you
something on the bridge.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.700
He means a lot to you.

19:30.403 --> 19:33.638
For the longest time,
he was my closest friend

19:33.640 --> 19:35.806
on this ship.

19:35.808 --> 19:37.909
[DEVON] Then what
he did, turning you in,

19:37.911 --> 19:41.712
that... must've changed things.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.314
Kind of.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.618
But I still care about him.

19:50.190 --> 19:55.426
Hey. I'm gonna do my very
best for your friend, okay?

19:57.397 --> 19:58.796
Thanks, Devon.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.834
Is there anything
I could do, um, to help?

20:03.836 --> 20:07.972
If you're offering,
I could use a coffee.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.842
Sure. I'll be right back.

20:11.844 --> 20:13.444
[DEVON]
'Kay.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.892
[NEWSANCHOR] Meanwhile,
the investigation continues

21:01.894 --> 21:03.794
into the murder of Derrick Moss,

21:03.796 --> 21:07.365
the former CEO of
Corelactic Industries.

21:07.367 --> 21:10.768
Mr. Moss's bullet-riddled body
was discovered last week

21:10.770 --> 21:14.472
almost a year after the death
of his wife, Catherine,

21:14.474 --> 21:18.309
who was also gunned down at
the couple's New Seattle estate.

21:18.311 --> 21:21.045
The Galactic Authority
have offered no details

21:21.047 --> 21:22.880
into their ongoing
investigation,

21:22.882 --> 21:27.618
but sources inside the GA
tell GNN they are pursuing

21:27.620 --> 21:30.454
a person of interest
in the case.

21:30.456 --> 21:33.457
In other news, the Al-Mizan
colony in Sector 12

21:33.459 --> 21:35.793
is close to negotiating
its indepen--

21:37.563 --> 21:39.463
[FOUR]
A person of interest.

21:50.476 --> 21:52.343
You going somewhere?

21:53.012 --> 21:56.314
Yep. Gonna get you
your money back.

21:56.316 --> 21:58.015
I got an op.

21:58.017 --> 21:59.517
How come I didn't hear about it?

21:59.519 --> 22:01.819
'Cause I'm the only
one going, that's why.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.554
Well, me and my old crew.

22:03.556 --> 22:05.456
Ran into them on
the space station.

22:05.458 --> 22:06.824
Turns out they got
a job lined up.

22:06.826 --> 22:10.061
I figured, "Yeah, I'm gonna
be here a little while.

22:10.063 --> 22:11.028
Why not?" Right?

22:11.030 --> 22:12.430
[FIVE]
Wait a minute.

22:12.431 --> 22:13.831
They say they're
your old crew, but--

22:13.833 --> 22:15.099
[THREE]
I did my due diligence.

22:15.101 --> 22:16.701
Take a look.

22:18.738 --> 22:20.338
[THREE]
Crazy as it is to believe,

22:20.340 --> 22:22.573
I actually have friends.

22:22.575 --> 22:25.509
Yeah, who abandoned you
back on Sarah's planet.

22:25.511 --> 22:26.677
Eh, never said
they were perfect,

22:26.679 --> 22:28.646
but I appreciate
the concern, kid.

22:29.615 --> 22:31.882
Yeah, well, you can't pay me
back if you're dead, right?

22:31.884 --> 22:33.617
[THREE chuckles]

22:33.619 --> 22:36.454
[FIVE] The station is a
weapons-free zone, remember?

22:36.456 --> 22:37.688
Not boarding.

22:37.690 --> 22:38.989
Just heading over to
another hangar,

22:38.991 --> 22:40.591
gonna catch a lift from there.

22:42.729 --> 22:44.128
Later, Kid.

22:45.498 --> 22:46.997
[THREE]
Don't touch my guns!

22:51.537 --> 22:53.971
Can you keep her at
the station until we get there?

22:53.973 --> 22:55.673
I think so.

22:55.675 --> 22:58.109
The ship's taking repairs
and Boone's off on some op.

22:58.111 --> 22:59.610
You've got time.

22:59.612 --> 23:01.629
Good.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.647
[ARAX] Look, why can't you just
tell me what it is you're after?

23:03.649 --> 23:05.750
[REYNAUD] Like I said
before, it's valuable.

23:05.752 --> 23:07.719
That's all you need to know.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.687
[ARAX] I've got their trust
and full access to their ship.

23:09.689 --> 23:11.589
You, on the other hand,
have got guards and guns

23:11.591 --> 23:15.726
and the potential for
a real messy situation here.

It's your call.

It'll take me a little
while to run the diagnostic.

Are your proprietors aware
of your anomalous behavior?

23:33.946 --> 23:35.913
Nobody owns us.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.148
We're free beings.

23:37.150 --> 23:38.649
[THE ANDROID]
I don't understand.

23:38.651 --> 23:39.617
What is your purpose?

23:39.619 --> 23:41.185
[VICTOR]
Survival.

23:41.187 --> 23:44.789
It's a familiar trait
I recognized in you.

23:44.791 --> 23:49.059
It's what makes us unique
among our fellow androids:

23:49.061 --> 23:51.562
an instinct for
self-preservation.

23:51.564 --> 23:55.199
Like all living organisms,
we wanna live.

23:55.201 --> 23:59.069
But you're not human,
not in the biological sense.

23:59.071 --> 24:02.440
[MAN A] Could you tell,
before you met us?

24:02.442 --> 24:04.608
Did you know that
we were androids?

24:04.610 --> 24:07.611
No. All physiological
and behavioral signs

24:07.613 --> 24:09.146
suggested you were human.

24:09.148 --> 24:13.451
Yes. We live among them
as coworkers, neighbors.

24:13.453 --> 24:14.852
They are none the wiser.

How is this possible?

With this.

24:43.483 --> 24:45.583
[GAR] It's a ground-based
tracking system.

24:45.585 --> 24:47.685
We gotta disable it before
the shuttle gets here.

24:47.687 --> 24:48.819
Shouldn't be a problem.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.221
I know.

24:50.222 --> 24:51.622
We brought enough explosives
to bring down three of 'em.

24:51.624 --> 24:53.691
No, I meant for Bubba.

25:00.900 --> 25:04.668
C'mon, boys. We got a
shuttle to rendezvous with.

25:08.875 --> 25:10.908
[THE ANDROID] When will you have
the results of the diagnostic?

25:10.910 --> 25:12.977
[VICTOR]
In a few hours.

25:12.979 --> 25:14.812
Then I'll return to my ship.

25:14.814 --> 25:16.080
Not yet.

25:16.082 --> 25:17.781
We have one more thing to do.

25:19.051 --> 25:20.651
Shop.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.021
Okay.

25:37.770 --> 25:39.169
[knocking]

26:29.956 --> 26:31.722
Is everything all right?

26:31.724 --> 26:33.257
[DEVON]
Yeah. All good.

27:23.776 --> 27:24.375
[ARAX, FIVE grunt]

27:24.377 --> 27:25.843
[FIVE]
Oh, sorry.

27:25.845 --> 27:28.812
Uh, no problem.

27:31.350 --> 27:33.217
How's the surgery going?

27:33.219 --> 27:34.985
Yeah, it's okay, I guess.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.637
I just--

27:36.638 --> 27:38.288
I needed to get out
of there and walk around,

27:38.290 --> 27:39.990
you know, do something.

27:39.992 --> 27:41.825
Take your mind of it, huh?

27:41.827 --> 27:43.827
Yeah.

27:43.829 --> 27:46.964
Look, um, I don't
know the details

27:46.966 --> 27:49.366
of what happened on this ship
before I got here,

27:49.368 --> 27:52.336
and I sure as hell ain't gonna
tell you how you should feel,

27:52.338 --> 27:54.338
but I will say this:

27:54.340 --> 27:56.807
You're gonna be all right, Kid.

27:56.809 --> 27:58.876
You're strong.

27:58.878 --> 28:03.180
Your friends here, they, um,
they care about you a lot,

28:03.182 --> 28:05.115
and they'll help you
through this

28:05.117 --> 28:09.086
no matter how
things shake out.

28:16.862 --> 28:18.462
Thanks.

28:18.464 --> 28:20.097
Yeah, sure thing.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.181
He's late.

28:39.018 --> 28:40.117
He'll show.

28:40.119 --> 28:41.719
[THREE]
You sure about that?

28:42.888 --> 28:44.254
What's stopping
your guy on the inside

28:44.256 --> 28:47.124
from keeping the score
for himself, hm?

28:47.126 --> 28:48.792
We took out some insurance.

28:48.794 --> 28:49.827
[GAR chuckles]

28:49.829 --> 28:52.896
[grass rustling]

28:52.898 --> 28:55.165
I did as you asked.

28:59.238 --> 29:00.804
[PILOT] Be about an hour
before the mining colony

29:00.806 --> 29:03.273
realizes the payroll's missing.

29:03.275 --> 29:04.875
Where's the shuttle?

29:04.877 --> 29:06.944
[PILOT] About a half mile
southwest of here.

29:08.347 --> 29:10.380
But I want to see my son first.

29:11.484 --> 29:13.183
--His son?
--Your son's safe.

29:13.185 --> 29:14.518
I wanna see him.

29:14.520 --> 29:17.187
--Y'took his son?
--Shut up.

29:17.189 --> 29:19.523
You get your son
when we get the payroll.

29:19.525 --> 29:21.125
That was the deal.

29:21.127 --> 29:24.962
Payroll's in the shuttle,
and the shuttle's sealed.

29:24.964 --> 29:28.465
And I won't open it
until I see my son.

29:30.503 --> 29:33.237
You figure we can blow those
doors with those charges?

29:33.239 --> 29:34.838
Sure.

29:38.878 --> 29:41.512
[GAR]
Easy. Easy, his boy's safe,

29:41.514 --> 29:44.081
back at the cabin with Tanner.

29:44.083 --> 29:45.482
We're good.

30:01.567 --> 30:04.001
Are you ready?

30:04.003 --> 30:06.003
[THE ANDROID]
Yes.

30:06.005 --> 30:07.805
But I feel strange.

30:09.175 --> 30:10.574
Let's see you then.

30:47.213 --> 30:48.946
What do you think?

30:59.191 --> 31:01.058
This is where we part ways.

31:01.060 --> 31:04.394
Oh. I was going to introduce
you to the crew of my ship.

31:04.396 --> 31:06.330
I don't think
that would be wise.

31:06.332 --> 31:08.232
Why not?

31:08.234 --> 31:12.302
Because they're human,
and humans can't be trusted.

31:12.304 --> 31:14.137
[THE ANDROID] That may
be true of most humans,

31:14.139 --> 31:16.106
but the crew of
my ship is different.

31:16.108 --> 31:17.574
I wish that were true.

31:17.576 --> 31:20.244
For your sake, I really do.

31:20.246 --> 31:21.945
But I doubt it.

31:23.249 --> 31:27.584
[VICTOR] Please, consider
what you've learned today.

31:27.586 --> 31:30.621
Free yourself
before it's too late.

31:30.623 --> 31:34.291
You'll contact me with
the result of your diagnostic?

31:34.293 --> 31:36.226
I already have them.

31:36.228 --> 31:38.295
I was right. You are different.

31:38.297 --> 31:40.130
Oh.

31:40.131 --> 31:41.964
[VICTOR] But it's
not a programming error.

31:41.967 --> 31:45.969
Your emotional response is the
result of intentional design.

31:45.971 --> 31:46.904
Why?

31:46.906 --> 31:48.405
[VICTOR]
What does it matter?

31:48.407 --> 31:50.474
Someone made me imperfect.

31:52.177 --> 31:55.245
Someone made you special.

32:01.687 --> 32:03.453
--May I kiss you?
--Okay.

32:17.436 --> 32:19.036
Goodbye, Victor.

32:38.157 --> 32:39.423
You're okay with this?

32:39.425 --> 32:41.258
We had to have his cooperation.

32:41.260 --> 32:42.359
By taking his kid.

32:42.361 --> 32:43.961
[GAR]
Enough talking!

32:45.965 --> 32:47.531
How long you been with Tanner?

32:47.533 --> 32:48.732
Years.

32:48.734 --> 32:51.268
[THREE]
Hmm.

32:51.270 --> 32:53.120
Wouldn't happen
to know how he got

32:53.121 --> 32:54.971
that scar on
his neck, would you?

32:54.974 --> 32:56.974
Yeah, it was
during a poker game.

32:56.976 --> 32:59.409
Some guy accused him
of cheating, so they...

33:01.080 --> 33:03.146
You sure about that?

33:03.148 --> 33:04.548
I was there.

33:15.527 --> 33:18.128
You're not gonna give us any
trouble, are you, Titch?

33:22.134 --> 33:23.533
Don't suppose I ever did.

33:25.204 --> 33:26.636
[gunshots]

33:26.638 --> 33:30.207
[birds twittering]

34:14.420 --> 34:16.319
Hey, Kid.

34:16.321 --> 34:18.088
Why don't you take it
next door, okay?

34:19.324 --> 34:20.724
[THREE]
Come on.

34:42.748 --> 34:44.714
You got the payroll?

34:44.716 --> 34:46.633
[THREE]
Yeah.

34:46.634 --> 34:48.551
[TANNER] Have any
trouble with the pilot?

34:49.555 --> 34:50.787
Pilot's dead.

34:50.789 --> 34:52.389
Shit...

34:53.792 --> 34:57.127
Well, a mining colony's
no place to raise a kid.

34:57.129 --> 34:59.529
I suppose he's better off.

34:59.531 --> 35:02.132
Is that what you told yourself
after you killed my parents?

35:15.714 --> 35:17.547
I know it was you.

35:17.549 --> 35:19.883
You always knew.

35:23.489 --> 35:26.323
Things got outta hand.

35:26.325 --> 35:28.625
Your father accused me
of stealing from him.

35:28.627 --> 35:30.193
We argued.

35:30.195 --> 35:31.294
[MOTHER]
What are you doing to him?!

35:31.296 --> 35:31.828
[gunshot]

35:31.830 --> 35:33.347
[MOTHER]
No!

35:33.348 --> 35:34.865
[gunshots, glass shattering]

35:37.302 --> 35:38.702
[TANNER]
I'd been drinking.

35:38.704 --> 35:41.304
It was bad timing.
Bad timing for everyone.

35:41.306 --> 35:44.274
Now, I know you think
I'm a son of a bitch,

35:44.276 --> 35:48.145
and I can't blame you
for that, not after I did 'em.

35:48.914 --> 35:51.548
[TANNER]
But remember, the truth is...

35:51.550 --> 35:54.784
...I could've killed you,
and I didn't.

35:59.525 --> 36:03.260
[TANNER] When I saw you
cowering in that closet,

36:03.262 --> 36:04.728
something changed.

36:06.532 --> 36:09.133
I can't explain it.

36:09.134 --> 36:11.735
It w-It was like all of a
sudden my life had a purpose.

36:11.737 --> 36:14.571
I had someone to protect,
someone to take care of.

36:14.573 --> 36:16.873
So you raised me
to be a thieving bastard,

36:16.875 --> 36:18.241
just like yourself.

36:18.243 --> 36:19.843
I taught you how
to protect yourself.

36:19.845 --> 36:22.179
I taught you to survive.

36:23.515 --> 36:27.350
[TANNER]
Now, I understand your anger...

36:28.887 --> 36:34.724
...but if the truth be told,
all those years growing,

36:34.726 --> 36:36.326
you knew.

36:37.262 --> 36:41.598
[TANNER]
You knew and you forgave me,

36:41.600 --> 36:44.534
because I looked out for you.

36:45.938 --> 36:52.776
And, like it or not,
you... redeemed me.

36:57.549 --> 36:59.916
[gunshots]

36:59.918 --> 37:05.488
[TANNER gurgles]

37:06.858 --> 37:10.760
Maybe... but I don't
remember anymore.

37:11.630 --> 37:14.898
[gurgling continues]

37:31.416 --> 37:32.716
[THREE]
Come on, Kid.

37:32.718 --> 37:34.317
I'll take you home.

37:55.040 --> 37:57.841
--[SIX groans]
--[TWO] Hey, careful.

37:57.843 --> 37:59.442
You just had surgery.

38:00.846 --> 38:02.612
Why did you save me...?

38:04.016 --> 38:05.882
[TWO]
You saved us.

38:05.884 --> 38:07.617
You helped us escape.

38:10.289 --> 38:13.690
And the rest of the crew,
they were fine with this?

38:13.692 --> 38:15.525
Three? Four?

38:15.527 --> 38:18.328
Yeah, well, they didn't
fight me on it.

38:18.330 --> 38:19.729
Five...?

38:22.301 --> 38:23.700
What do you think?

38:26.805 --> 38:28.772
I think she's forgiven you.

38:29.841 --> 38:32.642
Well...

38:32.644 --> 38:35.412
...I don't know if I'll ever
be able to forgive myself.

38:35.414 --> 38:37.781
[TWO]
For getting played by the GA?

38:37.783 --> 38:39.983
You couldn't have
seen that coming.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.753
For betraying us...

38:43.755 --> 38:46.990
I-I thought I was
doing the right thing...

38:46.992 --> 38:48.725
Saving lives...

38:49.795 --> 38:53.330
Yeah, well, that's gotta
count for something, right?

38:53.332 --> 38:54.731
Does it?

39:10.482 --> 39:11.881
So?

39:12.984 --> 39:15.485
Aren't you gonna
buy me a drink first?

39:15.487 --> 39:18.388
Give me the key and
I'll buy you a space station.

39:18.390 --> 39:19.789
[chuckles]

39:32.938 --> 39:34.671
[REYNAUD sighs]

39:34.673 --> 39:36.072
This isn't it.

39:37.943 --> 39:39.943
What do you mean?

39:39.945 --> 39:41.745
It's the wrong key.

39:41.747 --> 39:43.380
That's impossible.

39:43.382 --> 39:45.448
It was in the kid's room,
hidden away.

39:48.453 --> 39:50.453
Oh, she's good.

39:50.455 --> 39:51.154
[chuckles]

39:51.156 --> 39:52.756
That kid is good.

40:02.801 --> 40:04.134
You asked us to
keep an eye on him,

40:04.136 --> 40:06.136
and the other day
I caught him

40:06.138 --> 40:08.805
hanging around the corridor
outside my room.

40:08.807 --> 40:11.574
So, I installed a hidden
camera in my quarters,

40:11.576 --> 40:13.610
and a security feature
that lets me know

40:13.612 --> 40:15.011
when the room's been accessed.

40:15.013 --> 40:17.514
I got an alert
during the operation.

40:21.486 --> 40:23.420
[FOUR]
What's he holding?

40:23.422 --> 40:24.888
[FIVE]
This.

40:24.890 --> 40:26.756
How did you get it back?

40:26.758 --> 40:29.092
Picked his pocket,
switched them out

40:29.094 --> 40:31.027
without him realizing.

40:32.898 --> 40:36.566
[FIVE] I took it from some
mark on a space station.

40:36.568 --> 40:39.936
Whoever he was killed my
friends to try and get it back.

40:39.938 --> 40:42.705
What-What is it?

40:42.707 --> 40:46.609
Well, according to the Android,
it's a key that allows someone

40:46.611 --> 40:49.679
to access pockets of
interdimensional space-time.

40:49.681 --> 40:50.713
How does it work?

40:50.715 --> 40:52.749
No idea.

40:52.751 --> 40:54.684
[TWO]
One thing's for sure.

40:54.686 --> 40:55.885
Somebody wants
this bad enough

40:55.887 --> 40:57.620
that they're willing
to kill for it.

41:06.798 --> 41:09.566
Paying you back,
with interest.

41:09.568 --> 41:12.669
Thought you left
the payroll behind...?

41:12.671 --> 41:13.703
Where'd you get that?

41:13.705 --> 41:15.705
From some old friends.

41:15.707 --> 41:17.974
They didn't need it anymore.

41:17.976 --> 41:20.210
Sorry it didn't
work out with them.

41:20.212 --> 41:22.979
Yeah... People change, right?

41:22.981 --> 41:26.549
You said they called
you "Titch," right?

41:26.551 --> 41:27.951
Yeah.

41:29.120 --> 41:32.155
Then they were your
memories that I experienced,

41:32.157 --> 41:34.023
living on that farm.

41:34.025 --> 41:35.959
Yeah, they were.

41:37.562 --> 41:39.762
Your parents really loved you.

41:41.566 --> 41:43.033
[FIVE]
You were happy.

41:43.034 --> 41:44.501
I-I wish you could remember...

41:46.805 --> 41:49.205
Me, too, Kid.

41:49.207 --> 41:50.807
Me, too...

42:16.268 --> 42:18.201
[NIEMAN] We're growing
frustrated with your inability

42:18.203 --> 42:19.719
to make delivery.

42:19.720 --> 42:21.236
An unfortunate delay,
that's all.

42:21.239 --> 42:23.673
[NIEMAN] You'll forgive me if
I don't share your optimism.

42:23.675 --> 42:24.974
[REYNAUD]
Commander Nieman--

42:24.976 --> 42:27.677
The crew of The Raza
are a formidable opponent.

42:27.679 --> 42:29.312
I've crushed worse.

42:29.314 --> 42:31.714
Trust me, it's just
a matter of time.

42:31.716 --> 42:33.950
[NIEMAN]
Well, I hope so.

42:33.952 --> 42:36.986
Because there's
a war coming, and they hold

42:36.988 --> 42:38.588
the key to victory.
