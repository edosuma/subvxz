WEBVTT

00:00.934 --> 00:02.903
-(fanfare)
-(drum beat)

00:02.936 --> 00:05.373
(drum beat)

00:05.406 --> 00:06.407
ANNOUNCER: Fosse/Verdon.

00:08.042 --> 00:10.744
All new,
Tuesdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:13.247 --> 00:16.384
FXX presents You're the Worst.

00:20.121 --> 00:22.123
("Where We're Going" by Gashcat
playing)

00:27.061 --> 00:29.363
* Oh, lover, send me secrets

00:29.397 --> 00:32.900
* Down there from the dark fume
of the fire *

00:36.870 --> 00:39.273
* Into the garden
we would walk *

00:39.307 --> 00:41.909
* And ball your body
into wire... *

00:41.942 --> 00:42.910
You! Clean that window.

00:42.943 --> 00:45.113
MAN:
Yes, sir.

00:45.146 --> 00:48.749
Pistachios?
This isn't a baseball game.

00:48.782 --> 00:53.187
No, you want to present the
plate-- aioli smear at 12:00,

00:53.221 --> 00:56.257
and for God's sake,
call them servilletes.

01:01.729 --> 01:04.698
All good. Smashing. No notes.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.734
AtenciÃ³n!

01:08.636 --> 01:10.604
Hello, help.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.072
In my history
as a wedding guest,

01:12.106 --> 01:14.242
I have successfully heckled

01:14.275 --> 01:17.245
so many ceremonies, people are
gonna be gunning for us today.

01:17.278 --> 01:21.315
Thus, our nuptials
must be absolutely flawless.

01:21.349 --> 01:23.984
So, in the tradition
of punching a bully

01:24.017 --> 01:25.819
to demonstrate one's gravitas,

01:25.853 --> 01:27.888
you, ma'am, are sacked.

01:27.921 --> 01:31.792
You have been made redundant.
You are proper on the dole now.

01:31.825 --> 01:33.494
Let that be a warning
to you all.

01:33.527 --> 01:35.929
Oh, and have fun!

01:45.005 --> 01:48.142
* I'm gonna leave you anyway

01:48.176 --> 01:50.278
* I'm gonna leave you
anyway *

01:50.311 --> 01:53.881
* Gonna leave you anyway.

02:16.804 --> 02:19.540
Jimmy! Blessed day.

02:19.573 --> 02:22.876
Really, just jacked to shit.
I love you so goddamn much.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.612
Anyfarts, what are you
doing out here?

02:24.645 --> 02:27.615
Editing my vows, but now
I've pulled a thread.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.450
It's all starting to unravel.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.852
I did that to a sweater once.
You hear Gretchen's vows yet?

02:31.885 --> 02:33.687
No, but I cannot wait.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.523
You know they're
gonna be so emo.

02:35.556 --> 02:37.958
-(laughs)
-I hope she cries so hard
she vomits.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.660
(both laugh)

02:39.693 --> 02:40.661
-Oh, shit!
-Hey, welcome, guys.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.696
We can't see each other.

02:44.064 --> 02:46.033
SAM:
Gretchen.

02:46.066 --> 02:47.568
-Missed you.
-Huh, glad they're

02:47.601 --> 02:48.902
on good terms again.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.037
Hurry, hand it over.

02:50.070 --> 02:51.038
VERNON:
What's he handing her?

02:51.071 --> 02:52.873
JIMMY:
I don't know.

02:52.906 --> 02:56.644
That was weird.
Anyjunk, what's up?

02:56.677 --> 02:58.346
Why'd you need me early?
Last-minute titty bar?

02:58.379 --> 03:01.315
No. You're best man now.

03:01.349 --> 03:03.050
What?
(laughs)

03:03.083 --> 03:04.151
What?!

03:04.184 --> 03:06.920
No. No.

03:06.954 --> 03:09.923
Oh, my God!

03:09.957 --> 03:11.492
JIMMY:
Well, well, well.

03:11.525 --> 03:14.395
Here comes my big apology.

03:14.428 --> 03:16.029
Vernon, you're no longer
best man.

03:16.063 --> 03:20.434
Oh, okay. That's-that's fine.
I'm fine.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.841
-All right. Let's have it.
-Let's have what?

03:27.875 --> 03:30.077
The begging, the groveling.

03:30.110 --> 03:31.945
Perhaps one of your
signature pancakes

03:31.979 --> 03:34.282
with "sorry" spelled out
in frosting.

03:34.315 --> 03:36.617
Oh, no, I meant what I said.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.752
I just came to bring you
your rings.

03:38.786 --> 03:40.621
Oh, shit. Right, yeah.

03:40.654 --> 03:42.923
I was, uh, about to text you
for these.

03:44.592 --> 03:46.093
(tires screeching)

03:55.669 --> 03:56.970
(cries)

03:59.307 --> 04:01.542
PODCAST HOST: Katie Overholser
was not the kind

04:01.575 --> 04:03.744
of girl you could ignore,
so when she went missing...

04:03.777 --> 04:04.945
What are you doing?

04:04.978 --> 04:06.580
Waiting here in case
you change your mind

04:06.614 --> 04:07.748
and need a quick getaway.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.149
And it was that swiftness,

04:09.182 --> 04:11.118
with which the search
for Katie began,

04:11.151 --> 04:14.622
that would, four days later,
lead to her death.

04:14.655 --> 04:18.091
(panting)

04:18.125 --> 04:20.093
You're best man again.

04:20.127 --> 04:21.329
(whoops)

04:21.362 --> 04:23.063
What a roller coaster!

04:23.096 --> 04:25.599
It tastes so much sweeter
now that it was taken away.

04:25.633 --> 04:28.436
Your first order of business:
get rid of Edgar.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.647
(string music playing)

04:39.680 --> 04:40.981
(laughs)

04:43.717 --> 04:45.753
Hey, Paul.

04:45.786 --> 04:48.356
Lindsay.
Perhaps you can help me.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.758
It says I'm assigned
to Table 13,

04:50.791 --> 04:53.661
but I don't see any other guests
assigned to that table.

04:53.694 --> 04:56.330
Cool mystery.

04:56.364 --> 04:59.767
Hey, it was really nice
talking on the phone last night.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.436
It was, wasn't it?
(laughs)

05:02.470 --> 05:05.439
I'm glad to see I'm not the
only one here without a date.

05:05.473 --> 05:08.208
-Oh, I'm actually...
-Here you go, lover.

05:08.241 --> 05:11.545
Thank you. Keep the change.

05:11.579 --> 05:13.947
Seriously? Whoa.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.849
No one ever tips
at the Froyo store.

05:15.883 --> 05:17.317
I've thought about
putting a cup out,

05:17.351 --> 05:19.553
but it just feels desperate,
you know?

05:19.587 --> 05:22.790
-You brought the Froyo guy?
-I didn't want to come alone.

05:22.823 --> 05:26.026
Anyway, I better get this
Bride Fuel to Gretchen.

05:26.059 --> 05:28.362
See you boys later.

05:31.932 --> 05:36.870
Hey, got any errands
you need done for tips?

05:36.904 --> 05:41.709
Actually, would you see what you
can find out about Table 13?

05:41.742 --> 05:43.744
Will do, boss.

05:46.614 --> 05:48.682
GRETCHEN:
Okay, it's on.

05:48.716 --> 05:50.384
(squeals)
Hold on!

05:50.418 --> 05:54.054
You're going to want this moment
captured forever.

05:54.087 --> 05:56.557
Okay, come out. Let's see it.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.497
(gasps)

06:03.531 --> 06:06.099
It's so beautiful.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.675
Oh.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.277
Gretchen.

06:17.310 --> 06:19.713
I can't believe this day
is finally here.

06:19.747 --> 06:22.450
Oh, if you make me cry,
I'll kill you.

06:22.483 --> 06:25.853
I mean, think about all the men
it took to get here.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.288
-All right.
-So, so many men.

06:28.321 --> 06:33.126
So many men...
that I wrote a song about it.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.294
-(music playing)
-It's called

06:34.327 --> 06:36.864
"The Very Last Dick."

06:36.897 --> 06:38.298
-No.
-(music stops)

06:38.966 --> 06:40.367
I love you, though.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.270
Well, I love you, too.
Just a few lines?

06:43.303 --> 06:44.705
I rhyme Horatio and fel...

06:44.738 --> 06:47.975
No, no, no, no. Shh.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.810
(inhales)

06:49.843 --> 06:51.244
Mmm.

06:51.278 --> 06:53.280
(indistinct chatter)

06:57.585 --> 06:59.553
(sighs)

06:59.587 --> 07:00.554
(man speaks indistinctly)

07:00.588 --> 07:01.889
-It's Jimmy.
-Jimmy.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.924
(cheering and applause)

07:08.328 --> 07:10.731
JIMMY:
There they are.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.166
All right.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.301
MAN:
Excuse me.

07:14.334 --> 07:15.736
WOMAN:
Yeah, I'd still do him.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.738
-Nice suit.
-Hello.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.306
-Hey, how's it going?
-JIMMY: Yeah, excuse me.

07:19.339 --> 07:20.741
-PAUL: Groom advice.
-Yeah, thank you.

07:20.774 --> 07:21.942
Advice for the groom, excuse me.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.511
(chuckles)

07:23.544 --> 07:26.480
Just know that she's
never gonna change. (laughs)

07:26.514 --> 07:28.248
Lindsay sure didn't.

07:28.281 --> 07:31.151
Well, until she wanted to plow
other guys in front of me.

07:31.184 --> 07:33.120
That was a rather seismic shift.

07:33.153 --> 07:35.288
-Yeah, cuck, bye.
-But, hey, I have
earthquake insurance.

07:35.322 --> 07:37.525
Jimmy, never go back.

07:37.558 --> 07:40.427
Oh, wait, that's the tagline
for Jack Reacher 2.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.830
Did you know that Tom Cruise
is actually six-foot-one?

07:42.863 --> 07:44.865
If you want to add that
to your vows, Jimmy, go ahead.

07:44.898 --> 07:45.866
JIMMY:
What?

07:45.899 --> 07:46.934
(sighs):
Ah...

07:46.967 --> 07:48.936
I've been reading
about you in the trades.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.771
-Shame about your movie.
-Mm-hmm.

07:50.804 --> 07:51.939
But you'll sell another one.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.608
Or get staffed.

07:54.642 --> 07:57.277
You have to, because you're
marrying my daughter,

07:57.310 --> 08:00.948
which means you're responsible
for her now, forever.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.850
Yeah, unlike you.
Cheers, bye-bye.

08:02.883 --> 08:04.552
Oh, this is great, Jimmy.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.854
All weddings should open
with alcohol times.

08:06.887 --> 08:09.523
I got blue one and other one.

08:09.557 --> 08:10.958
WOMAN:
What happened?

08:10.991 --> 08:13.193
WOMAN 2: I slept
with my Uber driver last night.

08:13.226 --> 08:14.962
(Jimmy groans)

08:14.995 --> 08:17.497
Well, well, well.

08:17.531 --> 08:19.833
I am so happy
for the two of you.

08:19.867 --> 08:22.536
Look, just say whatever
awful thing you're gonna say.

08:22.570 --> 08:25.539
No, I'm serious. I think you
guys are perfect for each other.

08:25.573 --> 08:28.008
-That said...
-Here we go.

08:28.041 --> 08:31.211
...since you're not
technically married yet,

08:31.244 --> 08:35.983
my pregnancy hormones
have made me extra squishy.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.051
(groans)

08:38.085 --> 08:39.887
-Everyone here's an alcoholic.
-SAM: Jimmy!

08:39.920 --> 08:41.154
He's coming, he's coming,
he's coming, he's coming.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.189
-WOMAN: See?
-WOMAN 2: You're right.

08:42.222 --> 08:44.391
Jimmy! What a beautiful day.

08:44.424 --> 08:46.159
I got goose bumps already.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.161
It reminds me of my nuptials,
except, you know,

08:48.195 --> 08:50.030
less timelessly elegant.

08:50.063 --> 08:51.431
-Uh, was I there?
-Yes.

08:51.464 --> 08:53.266
Yes, yes, great event.
So lovely.

08:53.300 --> 08:57.370
Listen, what did you fellas
hand Gretchen this morning?

08:57.404 --> 08:59.372
-Uh, Forever Stamps.
-Passport photo
for your honeymoon.

08:59.406 --> 09:01.441
-Uh, cash, Mafia-style.
-Uh, ticket to Dudamel's Mahler
cycle, yeah.

09:01.474 --> 09:03.844
Bitcoins.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.113
Okay, fine.
She asked us for coke.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.749
She was worried she'd get too
drunk and ruin the special day.

09:08.782 --> 09:11.251
Oh. Oh, well,
phew, what a relief.

09:11.284 --> 09:13.621
I thought it was something bad.
No follow-ups.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.255
(stammering)

09:15.288 --> 09:16.957
There you are. The photographer
needs us around back.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.759
Did you get rid of Edgar?

09:18.792 --> 09:22.429
It's in process. Just get your
butt out there and look pretty.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.033
Lindsay.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.635
Huge emergency.

09:27.668 --> 09:30.938
Edgar's in his car
and you need to get rid of him,

09:30.971 --> 09:33.273
and I'm commandeering these
on behalf of the groom.

09:33.306 --> 09:36.409
Nothing I do today counts. Bye!

09:36.443 --> 09:38.145
HOST:
So, you were sleeping together?

09:38.178 --> 09:40.147
-MAN: Yeah, I mean...
-What?

09:40.180 --> 09:41.882
How could she
not tell the attorney

09:41.915 --> 09:43.450
that she used to date Kevin?

09:43.483 --> 09:45.485
Fuck.

09:45.518 --> 09:48.088
-Jesus, Lindsay.
-(beeps)

09:48.121 --> 09:51.258
What the fuck are you doing
out here in your car?

09:51.291 --> 09:53.326
I told Jimmy
not to marry Gretchen.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.664
What?! (sighs)

09:56.697 --> 09:58.298
Edgar.

09:58.331 --> 10:01.134
Jesus, you are the dumb one.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.603
You killed the group.

10:07.675 --> 10:08.676
(sniffles)

10:23.523 --> 10:25.492
MAN: That's why I didn't say
anything; it was just for us.

10:25.525 --> 10:26.794
HOST: But you knew
it could be important.

10:31.498 --> 10:33.834
Okay, now Charlie's Angels.

10:33.867 --> 10:36.103
Twins poster.

10:36.136 --> 10:39.439
You have four arms!

10:39.472 --> 10:41.374
An Officer and a Gentleman.
I'm the lady.

10:41.408 --> 10:43.343
Catch me! (grunts)

10:44.377 --> 10:46.479
(groans)

10:46.513 --> 10:47.748
Weekend at Bernie's.

10:50.517 --> 10:52.385
Right, I think we're good, yeah?

10:52.419 --> 10:54.287
I'll take the bride
and maid of honor next.

10:54.321 --> 10:58.558
Quick, go that way
so you don't run into her.

11:17.277 --> 11:19.847
Oh, my God, Jimmy, I'd hit it.

11:19.880 --> 11:23.150
I was never sure before,
but now, yeah,

11:23.183 --> 11:24.417
I'd definitely hit it.

11:27.587 --> 11:29.322
Someone said that Vernon
was taking photos with Jimmy.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.891
How come?

11:30.924 --> 11:34.261
Uh, yeah, no biggie, but Vernon
is Jimmy's best man now.

11:34.294 --> 11:36.830
Ooh, let's do the Stanky Legg.

11:36.864 --> 11:40.233
What? Why? Where's Edgar?

11:40.267 --> 11:43.203
-HOST: The fiber testing--
it failed spectacularly.
-No!

11:43.236 --> 11:45.205
What is the D.A. doing?

11:45.238 --> 11:48.675
The cops could've dragged in
those fibers on their shoes.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.410
-(groans)
-(car door opens)

11:50.443 --> 11:52.445
(beeps)

11:56.917 --> 11:59.086
Most girlfriends would have

11:59.119 --> 12:02.622
tolerated you for a month maybe.

12:02.655 --> 12:04.858
But letting you stay with him

12:04.892 --> 12:08.295
was, at times
of particular assholishness,

12:08.328 --> 12:11.398
the one humanizing thing
about Jimmy.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.300
Listen, I-I never meant to...

12:13.333 --> 12:15.435
I wouldn't say a word.
I really wouldn't.

12:16.503 --> 12:19.539
And while I liked you, Edgar,

12:19.572 --> 12:22.242
the one thing I could never do
was respect you.

12:22.275 --> 12:25.145
Because the first few times
it's like, "Hey,

12:25.178 --> 12:27.147
be nicer to the guy."

12:27.180 --> 12:29.783
But the next 2,000 times,
that's on you.

12:29.817 --> 12:31.785
I know. That's why I'm here.

12:31.819 --> 12:35.222
He is never going
to respect you.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.258
Never. Never.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.462
I'm just trying to stop him
from making a mistake.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.597
I don't even pity you anymore.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.633
I just hate you now.

12:46.666 --> 12:48.635
Leave.

12:48.668 --> 12:50.838
(car door opens)

12:50.871 --> 12:52.873
Leave now.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.312
(engine starts)

13:13.493 --> 13:15.495
(tires screech)

13:22.035 --> 13:24.671
(engine stops)

13:24.704 --> 13:27.107
HOST: And it was.
They did throughout the case.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.609
(string music playing)

13:29.642 --> 13:31.879
Hey, friend. Bad news.

13:31.912 --> 13:34.714
There is no Table 13.

13:34.747 --> 13:36.984
-I don't understand.
-Seems it's an old wedding joke

13:37.017 --> 13:39.386
for someone
no one wants to sit with.

13:39.419 --> 13:43.056
Oh, dear.

13:43.090 --> 13:46.559
Oh, my. That's dispiriting.

13:46.593 --> 13:50.363
Yeah, anyway,
why don't we say 50 bucks?

13:50.397 --> 13:52.632
I'll give you $200 to leave.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.667
Deal.

14:00.740 --> 14:03.476
(inhales)

14:03.510 --> 14:05.312
VERNON:
All right, Ben Folds.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.147
Ready to get your socks
knocked off?

14:07.180 --> 14:10.750
Whoa, that's delicious.

14:10.783 --> 14:12.252
What the heck is it?

14:12.285 --> 14:14.254
-It's called trash juice.
-Trash juice.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.489
It's magnificent.

14:16.523 --> 14:19.927
(laughs)
I knew I'd find you one day.

14:22.930 --> 14:24.932
(bell ringing)

14:32.805 --> 14:35.775
Ladies and gentlemen,
we will be opening the doors

14:35.808 --> 14:39.446
to the main hall in 15 minutes.

14:47.154 --> 14:50.357
Wait. What's "squishy"?

14:50.390 --> 14:54.327
Everything.
(laughs)

15:05.472 --> 15:08.641
Jimbo, I have
a very special guest. Aw-ooga!

15:08.675 --> 15:11.744
MILF alert, MILF alert.
It's Gretchen's mom.

15:11.778 --> 15:13.780
(exclaims)

15:16.149 --> 15:17.717
Just say whatever
you need to say.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.252
It's not gonna change anything.

15:21.121 --> 15:24.657
This was from her
great-grandmother, Gretchen.

15:24.691 --> 15:26.960
She was similarly feisty.

15:26.994 --> 15:30.797
I'd appreciate it if you'd give
it to her before the ceremony.

15:30.830 --> 15:32.465
Something old.

15:35.302 --> 15:37.470
A word of advice, Jimmy.

15:37.504 --> 15:40.307
The more you love Gretchen
and try to take care of her,

15:40.340 --> 15:41.975
the more she'll resent you.

15:42.009 --> 15:44.444
I really love her.

15:45.678 --> 15:47.680
I'm glad.

15:55.622 --> 15:56.990
HOST:
So, you and Katie were lovers?

15:57.024 --> 15:59.993
That sounds so old-timey.

16:00.027 --> 16:01.828
Look, Gretchen, I'm not leaving.

16:01.861 --> 16:03.496
-Okay?
-Take me home, Dmitri.

16:03.530 --> 16:06.099
I'm not your Lyft, Ben Folds.

16:06.133 --> 16:09.536
For real?
Dang, I keep doing that.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.204
I remember you.

16:11.238 --> 16:13.440
You're friend
with that British guy.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.308
How do you do it?

16:15.342 --> 16:18.378
Adult friendships
are so hard to maintain.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.813
Billy Corgan and I were
really close until that year

16:20.847 --> 16:23.716
that I got the better greenroom
at Weenie Roast.

16:23.750 --> 16:26.553
He never got over that.

16:26.586 --> 16:29.322
Point is, you're lucky.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.126
(horn honks)

16:33.160 --> 16:34.994
Okay, there's my ride.

16:35.028 --> 16:37.030
Folds out, motherfucker.

16:45.438 --> 16:46.739
HOST:
And then she died.

17:08.395 --> 17:09.996
Ah.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.932
Ah, okay.

17:12.965 --> 17:15.435
Hell yeah.

17:25.145 --> 17:27.013
No, no, no!

17:27.046 --> 17:28.948
I am not supposed to see you.

17:28.981 --> 17:30.450
What are you doing in here?

17:30.483 --> 17:32.519
You didn't write your vows?

17:32.552 --> 17:35.455
What? What are you
even talking about?

17:35.488 --> 17:38.525
I have them right... Oh, fine.

17:38.558 --> 17:41.861
I had the boys help me.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.930
You care so little

17:43.963 --> 17:47.800
about this wedding that
you even farmed out your vows?

17:47.834 --> 17:52.038
No. I care so much
that I hired a professional.

17:52.071 --> 17:55.108
Shitstain had his first poem in
The New Yorker when he was 19.

17:55.142 --> 17:56.543
You don't pick out the flowers,

17:56.576 --> 17:58.445
you don't get
your own dress, fine.

17:58.478 --> 18:01.448
But these, these are your vows!

18:01.481 --> 18:03.816
They're a sacred pledge to me,

18:03.850 --> 18:05.652
and you have someone else
write them?

18:05.685 --> 18:08.087
Why do you even...?

18:08.121 --> 18:09.556
Is Edgar getting in your head?

18:09.589 --> 18:10.757
Is that what this is about?

18:10.790 --> 18:12.459
No. What-what? No.

18:12.492 --> 18:14.261
If what Edgar said
didn't affect you,

18:14.294 --> 18:16.095
then why didn't you
tell me about it?

18:16.129 --> 18:18.398
Admit it, you normally
wouldn't give two shits

18:18.431 --> 18:20.600
if I didn't write my own vows.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.269
You're looking for an excuse.

18:22.302 --> 18:25.972
No, Gretchen.
I've been so busy justifying

18:26.005 --> 18:28.908
your lack of participation

18:28.941 --> 18:31.911
that I've ignored what you've
been trying to tell me:

18:31.944 --> 18:34.647
-you don't want to get married.
-I'm not well!

18:34.681 --> 18:37.950
No! You can't use that
as an excuse here.

18:37.984 --> 18:40.587
-Your mom was right.
-Do not bring up my mom!

18:40.620 --> 18:43.490
There's a part of you
that will resent me forever

18:43.523 --> 18:45.492
if I marry you.
You hate constraints,

18:45.525 --> 18:47.694
and that is what
I will forever be.

18:47.727 --> 18:50.697
-This is insane!
-Do you want to marry me?

18:50.730 --> 18:53.266
-I am here, aren't I?
-You're still not saying it.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.602
I'm in a dress! My mom is here.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.604
Say "I want to marry you."

18:57.637 --> 18:59.038
Stop bullying me!

18:59.071 --> 19:01.708
(groans)
Fine!

19:01.741 --> 19:03.410
I want to marry you!

19:05.478 --> 19:08.215
I do. I want to marry you.

19:08.248 --> 19:12.619
(exhales)
Goddamn it, Gretchen.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.622
(crying):
Well...

19:15.655 --> 19:18.258
I-I don't think
that I want to marry you.

19:36.776 --> 19:38.411
-You okay?
-It's an ambush.

19:38.445 --> 19:40.713
I've been ambushed. Gretchen...

19:40.747 --> 19:42.315
I know. I should have told you.

19:42.349 --> 19:44.384
You knew? What, you knew?

19:44.417 --> 19:47.119
I'm sorry, Jimmy, but I think
it's time you guys talked.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.934
They didn't tell you
I'd be here.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.370
-Nope.
-Ah.

20:03.403 --> 20:04.837
Yeah.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.439
(chuckles)
Listen, I don't...

20:06.473 --> 20:08.275
How's New York?

20:08.308 --> 20:10.910
Good. Loud.

20:10.943 --> 20:13.480
Lots of triggers,
but I'm adapting.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.950
I'm sorry for what I did
back then.

20:19.151 --> 20:22.088
-I'm sorry.
-You should be.

20:22.121 --> 20:25.292
It was inconceivably abhorrent.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.560
I know.

20:28.561 --> 20:31.197
But you were proved right.

20:31.230 --> 20:34.367
It took me a while to admit it,

20:34.401 --> 20:36.202
but it was, ultimately,

20:36.235 --> 20:41.274
a rather brave and...
selfless act.

20:41.308 --> 20:44.277
It wasn't selfless.

20:44.311 --> 20:48.080
It was the only way
I could get away from you.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.652
S-So, how are you?

20:52.685 --> 20:54.287
Good.

20:54.321 --> 20:56.723
Oh, really good.
I'm adapting a murder podcast.

20:56.756 --> 20:59.058
-Ah.
-Yeah, it's...

20:59.091 --> 21:00.960
(sighs) taken years
to work out the rights,

21:00.993 --> 21:03.896
but I'm interviewing
some writers while I'm in town.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.299
Ah. Well, I would throw
my hat in the ring,

21:06.333 --> 21:08.668
but I'm busy writing Depth.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.670
Yes. You know, I read Height.
So good.

21:10.703 --> 21:13.840
Man, those Victorians
were messed up.

21:13.873 --> 21:16.075
-(chuckles)
-So much spanking.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.110
Ah, you don't know
the half of it.

21:18.144 --> 21:21.648
-(laughs)
-You don't talk to me.

21:21.681 --> 21:23.550
Come on. It's been long enough.

21:25.552 --> 21:30.657
Besides, haven't you learned
by now that I'm always right?

21:35.395 --> 21:37.764
-(roars)
-Rawr! (squeals)

21:37.797 --> 21:39.766
Leave Uncle Edgar alone, baby.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.468
You already caught him.

21:41.501 --> 21:43.936
-Pick me up, Daddy.
-Yes, Miss Bossypants.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.137
(grunts)

21:45.171 --> 21:47.507
You met behind my back?

21:47.540 --> 21:49.141
Earlier today.

21:49.175 --> 21:51.344
I conned Edgar into playing
tiger with Felicity.

21:51.378 --> 21:52.545
MARIAH:
Come on, Wormy.

21:52.579 --> 21:54.481
Let's go find the appetizers.

21:54.514 --> 21:56.115
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.784
Yeah.

21:57.817 --> 22:00.019
Is that...?

22:00.052 --> 22:03.990
Uh, the florist who essed
Jimmy's dee? Yes.

22:04.023 --> 22:07.494
And it got all possible sexual
tension off the table forever,

22:07.527 --> 22:09.696
thus the perfect nanny.

22:09.729 --> 22:11.197
No danger of Afflecking here.

22:11.230 --> 22:12.732
PAUL:
There they are.

22:12.765 --> 22:14.066
What the hell are you guys
all doing out here?

22:14.100 --> 22:16.335
You can't miss our first dance.

22:16.369 --> 22:19.706
I mean, our second first dance.
Paul took lessons.

22:19.739 --> 22:21.508
Yes. I'm all prepared

22:21.541 --> 22:25.177
-to do the Lindsay Hop.
-(both laugh)

22:25.211 --> 22:27.380
Or perhaps I'll save that
particular move for tonight.

22:27.414 --> 22:30.717
(laughs) I don't know
what you're saying.

22:30.750 --> 22:33.052
We'll be right there.
I love you.

22:37.457 --> 22:39.358
-EDGAR: Hey, wait up.
-PAUL: Ooh, we met
Jimmy Fallon...

22:39.392 --> 22:42.061
You mad?

22:42.094 --> 22:44.531
Only murderously.

22:44.564 --> 22:47.734
Though I suppose that dead
little heart of yours

22:47.767 --> 22:50.036
-was in the right place.
-How'd it go with the house?

22:50.069 --> 22:53.840
(sighs) Well, it's officially
not ours anymore.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.675
Oh, I'm sorry, bud.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.844
But you know it was
a death trap for kids.

22:57.877 --> 23:00.212
Yeah. How was your hotel?

23:00.246 --> 23:02.615
Ugh, great.

23:02.649 --> 23:04.417
You were right.

23:04.451 --> 23:06.519
I couldn't get through
a month without drinking.

23:06.553 --> 23:07.587
Ah.

23:07.620 --> 23:09.589
But I did get digits.

23:09.622 --> 23:12.925
Cute, too. Mama's still got it.

23:12.959 --> 23:14.761
Oh, we should probably go in.

23:14.794 --> 23:19.966
Watch Paul and Lindsay make
the same mistake twice.

23:19.999 --> 23:22.134
First I'm gonna shake
all the presents.

23:22.168 --> 23:23.970
They ripped off
our non-wedding venue,

23:24.003 --> 23:26.138
they owe me a food processor.

23:26.172 --> 23:28.174
(laughs)

23:32.645 --> 23:36.816
Forgot my lighter.
I'll be right in.

23:45.257 --> 23:47.226
-Oh.
-I see Katie's parents,
but they won't look at me.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.227
The mood is tense.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.729
The judge enters.

23:49.762 --> 23:52.131
The jury enters,
looking tired, ragged.

23:52.164 --> 23:53.132
The forewoman Mary Elizabeth
stands.

23:53.165 --> 23:54.734
Damn it, Jimmy.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.235
FOREWOMAN: We, the jury,
find the defendant...

23:56.268 --> 23:57.403
(beeps)

23:57.436 --> 23:59.438
Let me clear some space for you.

24:01.007 --> 24:02.909
GRETCHEN:
Jimmy!

24:02.942 --> 24:05.444
Jimmy, no!

24:05.478 --> 24:07.780
No, Jimmy.

24:07.814 --> 24:09.649
It's not gonna be that easy
to leave me this time.

24:09.682 --> 24:11.250
You knew who I was.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.586
That's all you have to say?
That you're damaged?

24:13.620 --> 24:15.087
I'm getting
straight into Edgar's car.

24:15.121 --> 24:16.756
He's not here anymore, I...

24:16.789 --> 24:18.390
Motherfucker!

24:19.458 --> 24:21.293
Look.

24:21.327 --> 24:23.863
I tried to write my vows. I did.

24:23.896 --> 24:27.299
Many times, I tried with
all of this and I failed.

24:30.637 --> 24:31.971
Mine are just as phony.

24:32.004 --> 24:33.205
What?

24:33.239 --> 24:37.143
Writing them, I couldn't
imagine myself up there

24:37.176 --> 24:41.147
saying these things, so...
I wrote them as a character.

24:41.180 --> 24:43.282
Named Theodore.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.717
Writing to his future bride.

24:44.751 --> 24:47.453
A character named Samantha.
Sammy to friends.

24:47.486 --> 24:51.157
I had to pretend
to be someone who wants

24:51.190 --> 24:53.159
to take care of someone
in sickness and health.

24:53.192 --> 24:57.664
False concepts like "forever,"
"eternity," "until death."

24:57.697 --> 25:02.468
Who wants to lie
in front of everyone they know

25:02.501 --> 25:04.971
that they're gonna love
someone forever?

25:05.004 --> 25:07.840
How can you know that?!

25:07.874 --> 25:10.009
You can't!

25:11.210 --> 25:14.480
I feel like we're not
going back inside.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.849
You've been saying all along
that we might change.

25:16.883 --> 25:19.752
Well, can you really promise
that your feelings

25:19.786 --> 25:21.888
won't change 40 years from now?

25:21.921 --> 25:24.423
20 years from now?
Five years from now?

25:24.456 --> 25:28.194
This ceremony... is a fiction.

25:28.227 --> 25:30.496
It's a false guarantee

25:30.529 --> 25:32.865
that protects us
from exactly nothing.

25:32.899 --> 25:34.767
It's novocaine.

25:34.801 --> 25:36.268
It's an opiate.

25:36.302 --> 25:39.405
It's a lie.

25:39.438 --> 25:41.273
You were right.

25:44.276 --> 25:45.612
(heavy sigh)

25:45.645 --> 25:48.080
I know.

25:48.114 --> 25:50.116
I know I was.

25:53.986 --> 25:57.724
So, instead of making
these giant, fake,

25:57.757 --> 25:59.926
impossible-to-live-up-to
pledges,

25:59.959 --> 26:01.393
what the fuck are we gonna do?

26:01.427 --> 26:03.195
(sighs)

26:03.229 --> 26:05.564
What do you want, Jimmy?

26:08.735 --> 26:09.969
Pancakes.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.069
(seat belt clicks)

26:43.102 --> 26:44.637
(beeps)

26:44.671 --> 26:45.838
FOREWOMAN:
Not guilty.

26:45.872 --> 26:47.774
(gallery gasping on podcast)

26:47.807 --> 26:50.009
What, seriously? No.

26:50.042 --> 26:52.645
Oh, my God, that is insane.

26:58.284 --> 27:00.953
I can't find them.

27:00.987 --> 27:02.989
You have to do something.

27:08.127 --> 27:10.096
I couldn't help but overhear.

27:10.129 --> 27:11.964
Jimmy might have gotten
cold feet?

27:11.998 --> 27:14.033
I don't know, maybe.

27:14.066 --> 27:17.036
Well, the prospect of marriage

27:17.069 --> 27:19.605
can be very daunting.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.440
Hey.

27:21.473 --> 27:24.010
Did you have dauntings
about marrying me?

27:24.043 --> 27:25.477
No way, Jose.

27:25.511 --> 27:28.347
No dauntings.

27:28.380 --> 27:30.950
Me neither.
I'm sorry. (chuckles)

27:30.983 --> 27:32.184
(microphone feedback)

27:32.218 --> 27:33.319
VERNON:
Hello, everyone.

27:33.352 --> 27:34.787
Hello.

27:34.821 --> 27:37.556
Shut up!

27:37.589 --> 27:39.125
Best Man Vernon here.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.860
I don't want anyone
to lose their shit,

27:40.893 --> 27:43.162
but we can't find
the bride or groom.

27:43.195 --> 27:45.164
That really can
only mean one thing.

27:45.197 --> 27:47.299
Jimmy and Gretchen
are likely dead

27:47.333 --> 27:48.968
or have been
in a horrible accident,

27:49.001 --> 27:50.502
so starting to picture a life
without them

27:50.536 --> 27:52.739
is probably a smart move
at this point!

27:52.772 --> 27:54.473
(crowd murmuring)

27:54.506 --> 27:56.342
(chuckles) Hi.

27:56.375 --> 27:58.310
Sorry about that, everybody.

27:58.344 --> 28:02.348
Vernon is not good
in stressful situations.

28:02.381 --> 28:03.515
-(feedback)
-I'm so not!

28:03.549 --> 28:05.317
Everything is fine.

28:05.351 --> 28:06.886
(phones clacking,
text messages whooshing)

28:06.919 --> 28:09.255
The best thing to do...

28:09.288 --> 28:11.023
at a moment like this...

28:11.057 --> 28:12.224
(phones clacking,
messages whooshing)

28:12.258 --> 28:15.561
...is to listen
to a song I wrote.

28:15.594 --> 28:17.596
For the bride.

28:18.898 --> 28:21.167
(jazzy music plays)

28:21.200 --> 28:23.435
* There's Gregory at South By

28:23.469 --> 28:25.171
* Justin with the abs

28:25.204 --> 28:29.008
* Peter and Ruben
from Foot Locker *

28:29.041 --> 28:31.577
* There's Eugene
from the deaf school *

28:31.610 --> 28:33.545
* And Dylan, who sold coke

28:33.579 --> 28:37.449
* And don't forget that singer
from Spin Doctors *

28:37.483 --> 28:39.718
* Bryce, who was weirdly loud

28:39.752 --> 28:42.088
* Mike, who was well-endowed

28:42.121 --> 28:45.792
* If far longer than thick

28:45.825 --> 28:47.794
* Quite possibly piled up

28:47.827 --> 28:50.729
* Couldn't beat

28:50.763 --> 28:52.765
* The very last dick.

28:52.799 --> 28:55.534
(guests murmuring)

28:55.567 --> 28:57.069
(line ringing)

28:57.103 --> 28:59.105
(phones ringing, buzzing)

29:11.350 --> 29:14.486
-So we're not getting married.
-No.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.889
-But we're not breaking up.
-No.

29:16.923 --> 29:18.690
So what are we going to do?

29:20.759 --> 29:24.596
Every day... we choose.

29:24.630 --> 29:26.632
Huh?

29:28.634 --> 29:30.236
I don't want to be with you

29:30.269 --> 29:32.771
because I made a promise
to be with you.

29:32.805 --> 29:34.907
I want to be with you
because I want to be with you.

29:34.941 --> 29:38.978
So every day... we wake up,

29:39.011 --> 29:40.779
we look at each other and say,

29:40.813 --> 29:45.651
"Today, again... I choose you."

29:45.684 --> 29:49.488
Until maybe one day we don't.

29:49.521 --> 29:51.690
You know I love the idea
of always having

29:51.723 --> 29:53.125
one foot out the door.

29:53.159 --> 29:54.526
We don't declare anything.

29:54.560 --> 29:57.529
Except this.

29:57.563 --> 30:01.901
Gretchen, every day I will
make the choice to love you.

30:03.302 --> 30:06.338
And love you I will.

30:06.372 --> 30:08.807
Wholeheartedly.

30:08.841 --> 30:11.477
That one day.

30:11.510 --> 30:13.479
Because I choose to.

30:16.515 --> 30:18.985
I really like it.

30:19.018 --> 30:20.486
Me, too.

30:22.521 --> 30:25.657
(both sigh)

30:25.691 --> 30:28.294
I'm sorry you didn't get
your wedding.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.296
We got photos of me
looking fly as hell,

30:30.329 --> 30:32.064
that's really all that matters.

30:33.332 --> 30:34.733
You know the one thing
I do regret?

30:34.766 --> 30:36.168
All the money we wasted?

30:36.202 --> 30:38.304
Leaving everyone in the lurch?

30:38.337 --> 30:41.407
Not getting the chance to see
Paul wandering around,

30:41.440 --> 30:43.042
looking for his table all night?

30:43.075 --> 30:45.912
Leaving behind all those gifts.

30:45.945 --> 30:49.315
I already texted Vernon
to load up the car with them.

30:49.348 --> 30:50.849
God, I love you.

* You do nothing...

31:01.293 --> 31:02.561

31:02.594 --> 31:04.596
* With me.

31:08.134 --> 31:13.239
* Fading back into the night

31:13.272 --> 31:16.875
* No, nothing's
gonna wake me now *

31:16.909 --> 31:21.713
* Far away from what we are

31:25.284 --> 31:30.256
* Hold me up into the light

31:30.289 --> 31:33.625
* Get back
to where we started out *

31:33.659 --> 31:38.630
* Find a way up in the sky

31:46.338 --> 31:51.877

few remaining friends *

32:03.789 --> 32:05.992
* Give up on trying to save us

32:06.025 --> 32:09.395
* I hope we come off
with a fail-safe plot *

32:09.428 --> 32:12.331
* To piss off the dumb few
that forgave us *

32:12.364 --> 32:13.966
* I hope the fences we mended

32:14.000 --> 32:17.436
* Fall down beneath
their own weight *

32:17.469 --> 32:20.973
* And I hope we hang on
past the last exit *

32:21.007 --> 32:23.575
* I hope it's already too late

32:23.609 --> 32:26.512
* And I hope the junkyard
a few blocks from here *

32:26.545 --> 32:29.315
* Someday burns down

32:29.348 --> 32:31.817
* And I hope the rising black
smoke carries me far away *

32:31.850 --> 32:36.755
* And I never come back
to this town again *

32:36.788 --> 32:39.458
* In my life

32:39.491 --> 32:41.227
* I hope I lie

32:43.295 --> 32:45.664
* And tell everyone
you were a good wife *

32:45.697 --> 32:48.467
* And I hope you die

32:48.500 --> 32:52.038
* I hope we both die

33:02.714 --> 33:05.717
* I hope I cut myself
shaving tomorrow *

33:05.751 --> 33:08.654
* I hope it bleeds
all day long *

33:08.687 --> 33:11.723

before the sun rises *

33:11.757 --> 33:14.693
* We're pretty sure
they're all wrong *

33:14.726 --> 33:17.663
* I hope it stays dark forever

33:17.696 --> 33:19.731
* I hope the worst isn't over

33:19.765 --> 33:23.135
* And I hope you blink
before I do *

33:23.169 --> 33:25.537
* I hope I never get sober

33:25.571 --> 33:27.473
* And I hope,
when you think of me *

33:27.506 --> 33:29.375

you can't find *

33:29.408 --> 33:31.210

33:31.243 --> 33:33.512
* And I'd hope that,
if I found the strength *

33:33.545 --> 33:37.249
* To walk out, you'd stay
the hell out of my way *

33:37.283 --> 33:41.720
* I am drowning,
there is no sign of land *

33:41.753 --> 33:45.091

33:45.124 --> 33:47.993
* Hand in unlovable hand

33:48.026 --> 33:50.496
* And I hope you die

33:50.529 --> 33:52.564
* I hope we both die.

Hey, you know that there's
always a possibility

34:09.981 --> 34:12.451
that some day I might leave
my phone and keys at home

34:12.484 --> 34:14.553
and step in front of a train.

34:14.586 --> 34:16.822

34:20.326 --> 34:21.760
Yeah.
