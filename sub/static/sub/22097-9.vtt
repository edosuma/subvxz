WEBVTT

00:03.638 --> 00:05.902
<i>Previously on Battlestar Galactica.</i>

00:37.639 --> 00:39.266
I notice you're calling her
Sharon now.

00:39.340 --> 00:41.638
She acts like one
of them, thinks like them.

00:41.743 --> 00:43.938
She's one of them.
But she's one of us.

00:44.012 --> 00:47.470
We gotta go. Now. We gotta travel
fast. Even faster than before.

00:51.252 --> 00:53.686
<i>They found him in the
starboard storage compartment.</i>

00:53.888 --> 00:56.618
He's another copy of the Cylon
you know as Leoben.

00:56.758 --> 01:01.161
I'll send a team over to destroy it.
Anything it says cannot be trusted.

01:01.362 --> 01:04.058
Don't!
Adama is a Cylon.

01:46.441 --> 01:49.205
Commander?
Here's Dr. Baltar's report.

01:49.744 --> 01:53.202
And the President is waiting
for you up in the core.

01:53.715 --> 01:55.080
Thank you.

02:19.941 --> 02:21.533
Clear the deck.

02:25.146 --> 02:27.478
Madame President,
we are the proud owners...

02:27.548 --> 02:30.881
of the universe's first,
bona-fide Cylon detector.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.616
That is great news.

02:35.923 --> 02:37.151
Yeah.

02:38.760 --> 02:40.660
So, when do we begin?

02:40.895 --> 02:44.422
Dr. Baltar would like to start
widespread testing as soon as possible...

02:44.532 --> 02:47.797
but there are
some serious limitations.

02:47.969 --> 02:52.235
He can only do one person at a
time, and verification takes hours.

02:53.608 --> 02:55.769
So who's going to go first?

02:59.881 --> 03:01.849
The tests. Right.

03:03.885 --> 03:06.718
I think people in sensitive
positions should go first.

03:06.788 --> 03:09.552
I completely agree.
How about you?

03:12.593 --> 03:13.958
Excuse me?

03:14.462 --> 03:17.989
If you're a Cylon,
I'd like to know.

03:18.333 --> 03:20.893
If I'm a Cylon,
you're really screwed.

03:23.638 --> 03:27.597
Seriously, I do think that
you should go first.

03:28.176 --> 03:31.634
Show everyone in the fleet that
they can trust the people at the top.

03:31.713 --> 03:34.147
Then maybe
you should go first.

03:40.555 --> 03:45.015
All right, I'll go first.

03:45.626 --> 03:48.493
I think that's good. I do.

04:01.075 --> 04:02.667
<i>Bank on my advice.</i>

04:10.385 --> 04:14.014
They always do that?
No, they're just showing off.

04:14.455 --> 04:16.389
They know I'm in here.

04:18.292 --> 04:22.251
You date a special assistant
to the President, word gets out.

04:22.697 --> 04:25.598
So this is officially a date?

04:29.904 --> 04:31.599
Jury's still out.

04:32.573 --> 04:35.542
<i>Observation deck
has two minutes remaining.</i>

04:37.278 --> 04:38.745
You could pull rank.

04:38.813 --> 04:42.772
You could tell them you're on special
business for the President of the Colonies.

04:42.884 --> 04:45.876
Your boss pulls more weight
around here than mine.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.148
You can tell them
Adama wants you to...

04:48.222 --> 04:51.419
Yeah, what? Wants me to what?

04:55.630 --> 04:57.393
I lost my train of thought.

05:17.618 --> 05:20.109
How is he these days,
by the way?

05:20.688 --> 05:23.987
The old man?
He's fine, I guess.

05:25.126 --> 05:26.559
You guess?

05:27.161 --> 05:31.723
He's been acting kind of funny
lately. Seems distracted or something.

05:33.167 --> 05:37.001
He's been making all these weird
calls from his quarters. Super secret.

05:38.172 --> 05:39.400
Probably a security thing.

05:40.074 --> 05:44.738
They don't want me to log the calls,
though. No trace file. Nothing.

05:46.113 --> 05:48.911
And this just started?
A few days ago.

05:53.554 --> 05:58.457
Billy Keikeya, are you pumping me
for information about the old man?

05:59.060 --> 06:00.425
Time's up.

06:03.364 --> 06:06.231
No. Of course not.
You are.

06:06.434 --> 06:11.337
You are. You're a spy, that's what you are.
I was just asking a couple of questions.

06:11.439 --> 06:13.737
I hope you liked the answers.

06:14.809 --> 06:19.473
Because they're the last ones
you're gonna get for a while.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.180
What did you find out?

06:25.286 --> 06:27.447
Dualla couldn't put
her finger on it...

06:27.522 --> 06:30.491
but, yeah, she said
he's been acting differently.

06:30.591 --> 06:35.460
I could see that myself. He was
distracted and unfocused. What else?

06:37.331 --> 06:40.425
Some scrambled wireless calls
he didn't want logged.

06:40.501 --> 06:45.495
She didn't know who he called or why.
But none of this is damning evidence.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.740
The calls could be
security-related...

06:47.808 --> 06:51.437
and his odd behavior could be
stress, pure and simple.

06:51.812 --> 06:56.146
Exhaustion, paranoia... All right.
It could be any of those things.

06:56.584 --> 06:58.484
But what if it's not?

07:02.356 --> 07:05.257
Madame President,
with all due respect...

07:06.093 --> 07:09.654
I cannot believe we're actually
entertaining the idea...

07:09.730 --> 07:11.755
that Comdr. Adama...

07:11.866 --> 07:16.269
has been somehow replaced
by a Cylon duplicate.

07:19.907 --> 07:21.772
Oh, my gods, Billy...

07:22.910 --> 07:24.741
I hope you're right.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.379
Is suicide really a sin?

08:45.925 --> 08:47.893
A mortal one, I'm afraid.

08:47.961 --> 08:50.759
But it's not that bad,
is it, Gaius?

08:53.333 --> 08:56.860
47,905 people in the fleet.

08:58.438 --> 09:03.239
47,905 blood samples.

09:04.778 --> 09:09.215
11 hours to test
each one for Cylon indicators.

09:09.482 --> 09:11.313
That'll take awhile.

09:11.985 --> 09:16.388
21,956 days.

09:17.123 --> 09:20.115
60.1534 years.

09:20.827 --> 09:23.660
Now, let's figure in a few
hours to sleep here and there.

09:23.763 --> 09:27.597
We'll call it an even
61, shall we? Sure.

09:28.968 --> 09:30.993
I prefer to kill myself.

09:37.510 --> 09:41.105
Comdr. Adama, are you a Cylon?

09:45.051 --> 09:46.882
Tune in tomorrow.
No.

09:47.287 --> 09:51.280
It's hard being a genius.
Yes.

09:52.292 --> 09:55.352
There should be some perks.
Yes.

10:55.755 --> 10:57.313
What's up, Doc?

11:01.127 --> 11:04.426
Lt. Thrace, good to see you.
I was just...

11:05.999 --> 11:08.524
keeping up
with the old exercises.

11:11.704 --> 11:14.605
That should do me for today.

11:16.509 --> 11:17.669
I feel a lot better.

11:17.777 --> 11:21.304
What brings you to the lab
at this time of the night?

11:21.614 --> 11:23.775
It's the middle of the
afternoon. Yeah, it is.

11:23.850 --> 11:27.183
Crazy workload.
I totally lose track of time.

11:27.287 --> 11:29.380
So, what can I do for you?

11:30.156 --> 11:31.953
You can zip up your fly.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.361
So...
My blood test.

11:39.566 --> 11:41.591
You're right about
one thing, Gaius.

11:42.268 --> 11:45.032
There is something
very intriguing about her.

11:47.340 --> 11:50.673
Very good. Very good.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.298
At least I did that much.

12:58.244 --> 12:59.905
Dradis, contact!

12:59.979 --> 13:03.745
<i>Cylon Raider bearing 738
carom 005. Galactica, Apollo.</i>

13:03.816 --> 13:06.785
Action stations. Cylon
Raider bearing 738 carom 005.

13:06.886 --> 13:09.684
Relative zero. Close with
enemy, destroy. Acknowledge.

13:10.356 --> 13:12.347
<i>We're on it, Galactica.</i>

13:12.992 --> 13:15.790
He jumped right in
front of us. His mistake.

13:19.499 --> 13:22.263
How many? Single Raider.
Looks like a recon patrol.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.269
Apollo and Beehive have
them in their sight.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.669
Where's the old man?
He's not aboard.

13:26.773 --> 13:30.766
Not aboard? Where the hell is he? He
left in a Raptor about an hour ago.

13:30.843 --> 13:32.936
No flight plan. No flight plan?

13:33.012 --> 13:35.947
That's it, Beehive. You set
him up, I'll knock him down.

13:47.627 --> 13:50.926
<i>I winged him. Looks
like I got his weapon systems.</i>

13:51.864 --> 13:52.990
He jumped.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.994
<i>He jumped away before
we could zero him out.</i>

13:56.069 --> 14:00.768
Damn it. Probably giving away our position
to every Cylon base ship right now.

14:00.873 --> 14:03.364
Where in the hell
is the old man?

14:05.745 --> 14:08.714
Order the fleet to execute
emergency jump procedures.

14:08.781 --> 14:11.147
Everyone rendezvous
at the stand-by coordinates.

14:11.217 --> 14:12.343
Contact!

14:12.418 --> 14:17.355
Single Raider bearing
881 carom 247.

14:17.790 --> 14:22.659
<i>Apollo, Galactica, Cylon Raider
detected at 881 carom 24...</i>

14:23.563 --> 14:26.361
<i>Wait, I see him!
It's the same Raider.</i>

14:26.466 --> 14:27.455
What?

14:27.533 --> 14:30.263
It's the same Raider. I can
see the damage from before.

14:33.806 --> 14:35.933
<i>It's behaving erratically.</i>

14:38.311 --> 14:40.176
<i>He jumped away again.</i>

14:41.014 --> 14:44.142
Contact. Single Raider,
same telltales.

14:46.586 --> 14:51.455
It's like he's just flying around in
circles. Wounded bird. Can't fly home.

14:52.258 --> 14:54.590
<i>Galactica. We got him on Dradis...</i>

14:54.660 --> 14:55.752
<i>but he's pretty far out there.</i>

14:55.828 --> 14:58.296
<i>Take us three minutes
to close to weapons range.</i>

14:58.364 --> 15:02.095
No. This is our perfect chance
to get some intel.

15:02.769 --> 15:06.170
Order Apollo to close with
the Raider, but do not engage.

15:06.272 --> 15:08.297
Put a Raptor in the air.

15:08.374 --> 15:10.535
As long as that's flopping
around out there...

15:10.610 --> 15:14.137
tell them I want to suck in
every electronic signal it makes.

15:14.247 --> 15:17.739
Sir. Colonel, Comdr. Adama's
Raptor is requesting permission...

15:17.850 --> 15:21.251
to enter the landing pattern.
Permission granted.

15:21.988 --> 15:24.923
Stand down to Condition Two.
Permission granted.

15:25.024 --> 15:27.322
Mr. Gaeta, you have the deck.

16:06.566 --> 16:08.591
Permission to come aboard,
sir. Granted.

16:08.668 --> 16:11.102
Mind telling me
where the hell you've been?

16:11.804 --> 16:15.137
Col. Tigh,
allow me to present your wife.

16:21.747 --> 16:22.941
Ellen.

16:51.976 --> 16:54.706
That noise. I don't get it.

16:54.812 --> 16:59.181
I've blown Centurions away before.
They've never sent an entire army after me.

16:59.417 --> 17:02.113
They're after me. Why you?

17:04.255 --> 17:06.485
While they were holding me,
I overheard some things.

17:06.557 --> 17:08.889
What?
Plans. Deployments.

17:09.160 --> 17:12.152
There's a big Cylon base
at Delphi. A major hub.

17:12.230 --> 17:15.165
Delphi? Frackking bastards.

17:15.233 --> 17:19.795
The best place to try to grab a ship
and get off this frackking planet.

17:32.483 --> 17:35.077
Dr. Gaius Baltar, Department
of Cylon Detection...

17:35.153 --> 17:37.280
how may I direct your call?

17:37.388 --> 17:40.585
<i>You're in a good
mood. Madame President...</i>

17:43.094 --> 17:46.791
I'm sorry. I was expecting someone
else. We haven't spoken in ages.

17:46.898 --> 17:50.732
Doctor, I'd like you to call me the
moment Comdr. Adama's test is complete.

17:50.802 --> 17:51.894
Will you do that?

17:51.969 --> 17:55.063
Comdr. Adama cancelled
his test a short time ago.

17:57.008 --> 17:59.704
Why?
I don't know.

17:59.811 --> 18:03.042
He gave me another sample.
He said it had priority.

18:03.147 --> 18:05.274
Whose?
I'll just check.

18:08.653 --> 18:13.113
Some woman called Ellen. No
surname. He dropped it off and left.

18:13.191 --> 18:14.556
Is there a problem?

18:14.659 --> 18:17.321
Dr. Baltar, I would like
you to resume testing...

18:17.395 --> 18:20.990
Comdr. Adama's blood sample
immediately. Thank you.

18:25.970 --> 18:30.236
I can't believe you're alive.
I can't believe it myself.

18:33.878 --> 18:37.678
Saul, I don't remember
the last few weeks.

18:38.382 --> 18:40.373
It's weeks, right?
Right.

18:40.485 --> 18:42.851
<i>You've been on
the Rising Star all this time?</i>

18:42.920 --> 18:44.353
I guess so.

18:45.022 --> 18:48.514
The last thing I remember
is being on Picon.

18:49.093 --> 18:51.584
I was at the airport
buying a ticket home...

18:51.696 --> 18:55.097
and hearing something
about the Cylons.

18:55.533 --> 18:59.629
And then just dreams,
mostly dreams...

19:01.239 --> 19:03.264
until a couple days ago.

19:04.575 --> 19:08.909
They tell me I was knocked out when
the Cylons attacked the airport.

19:09.580 --> 19:12.811
And someone
just picked me up...

19:14.318 --> 19:16.878
and put me on
the last flight out.

19:20.258 --> 19:23.659
Some savior.
I don't even know who.

19:24.495 --> 19:27.953
It's all right.
You're here now.

19:32.603 --> 19:34.503
It's like we
found a treasure chest.

19:34.605 --> 19:36.539
One of the major issues
we've been having...

19:36.641 --> 19:40.099
with the Raider we captured is trying to
figure out the faster-than-light drive.

19:40.178 --> 19:43.545
This wounded bird is jumping
all over the place out there.

19:43.648 --> 19:48.347
Yeah. And every time it jumps, it
gives us more data that we can use.

19:48.886 --> 19:52.481
But what was it doing out there,
and how long can he keep it up?

19:52.557 --> 19:56.220
The moment you have your
FTL data, give me an update.

19:56.327 --> 19:59.694
Let's not let this thing linger
out there longer than we have to.

19:59.797 --> 20:01.230
Yes, sir.

20:01.332 --> 20:05.291
You wanted to see me, sir?
Stay on it.

20:05.369 --> 20:06.768
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

20:12.877 --> 20:14.777
You have dinner plans?

20:15.580 --> 20:18.811
What?
Come on.

20:21.219 --> 20:25.280
I never thought I'd see
your face again. Me neither.

20:27.859 --> 20:31.260
The things I said before,
the things I did...

20:31.762 --> 20:34.526
In the past.
It's all in the past.

20:36.367 --> 20:40.463
Start over?
Start over.

20:54.318 --> 20:57.617
I can't.
Forget it.

20:58.656 --> 21:02.353
I can't. I'm on duty.

21:12.103 --> 21:15.163
XO. Now?

21:16.607 --> 21:20.703
Understood. All right.
Tell her I'm on my way.

21:22.013 --> 21:23.446
Girlfriend?

21:24.649 --> 21:28.745
Official business.
Feels like old times.

21:28.986 --> 21:32.422
I'd explain, but...
It's classified.

21:33.658 --> 21:35.319
I'll be back as soon as I can.

21:36.727 --> 21:37.887
Okay.

21:42.700 --> 21:45.669
I'll be here, waiting.

21:47.338 --> 21:49.033
As soon as I can.

21:59.116 --> 22:02.916
You want to be very, very
careful with what you just said.

22:03.587 --> 22:07.546
You're talking about a man I
owe my life to, many times over.

22:08.693 --> 22:10.558
I know these
are uncertain times...

22:10.628 --> 22:13.222
and this has been a
difficult transition for you.

22:13.297 --> 22:15.288
Excuse me, Colonel.

22:16.267 --> 22:20.294
I do appreciate how difficult this
is for you to hear, believe me.

22:20.404 --> 22:25.103
But I would advise you right now not
to say anything that you will regret.

22:33.784 --> 22:37.345
I need to know if you have
seen anything suspicious...

22:37.455 --> 22:39.855
about his recent behavior.
No.

22:41.993 --> 22:44.291
<i>What about the fact
that he left the Galactica...</i>

22:44.362 --> 22:48.423
without telling anyone where he
was going or when he would return...

22:48.499 --> 22:53.459
and at that very moment, a
Cylon Raider jumped into view...

22:53.904 --> 22:57.670
and started acting strangely?
I know exactly where he was.

22:57.742 --> 23:00.905
You do?
He was picking up my wife.

23:05.716 --> 23:07.081
Your wife?

23:07.318 --> 23:09.548
Turns out she's
been unconscious...

23:09.620 --> 23:12.248
<i>aboard the Rising Star
ever since the attack.</i>

23:12.390 --> 23:13.823
Oh, my gods!

23:14.358 --> 23:18.021
That's fantastic. That's
amazing. Yes, it is.

23:18.329 --> 23:22.129
When Ellen stepped off that shuttle,
I thought I was going to pass out.

23:23.734 --> 23:24.928
Ellen?

23:27.538 --> 23:30.336
Your wife's name is Ellen?
Yes, it is.

23:30.508 --> 23:33.306
Ellen. Ellen Tigh.

23:34.779 --> 23:38.806
I'd very much like to
meet your wife, Colonel.

23:39.216 --> 23:41.275
Resume the test on Ellen?

23:43.721 --> 23:47.122
No, it's no trouble at all.

23:54.331 --> 23:55.559
Ellen?

23:57.401 --> 23:59.562
Did you shut the door?
I already did.

24:03.908 --> 24:07.969
Surprise. Ambrosia?
Where did you get this?

24:08.079 --> 24:10.604
I have my ways.

24:11.315 --> 24:15.308
I thought it might be just the
thing for a little celebration.

24:20.024 --> 24:23.221
We need to talk.
First things first.

24:26.997 --> 24:28.191
There.

24:30.134 --> 24:32.625
Starting over.
Starting over.

24:37.842 --> 24:42.370
I'm technically still on duty. I think
they can do without you for a day.

24:42.480 --> 24:44.710
It doesn't really
work that way.

25:10.407 --> 25:11.965
Starting over.

25:28.392 --> 25:32.328
Sure, there's whining and
complaining like you would expect...

25:32.396 --> 25:37.356
but the people I talked to are
mostly hopeful and optimistic.

25:38.202 --> 25:39.464
That's good to hear.

25:42.606 --> 25:46.201
There are a few people
who still might wonder...

25:46.277 --> 25:50.043
if a kindergarten teacher is really
the right person to be President...

25:50.114 --> 25:52.207
but they're just
a tiny, tiny minority.

25:53.083 --> 25:54.607
Wonderful.

25:55.452 --> 26:00.389
<i>Everyone is so truly grateful
to all of you on Galactica.</i>

26:01.125 --> 26:05.619
You literally are our saviors.
We're just doing our jobs.

26:05.696 --> 26:07.254
You are so modest.

26:09.700 --> 26:11.361
He's always been that way.

26:14.605 --> 26:18.905
Lee, could I trouble you for a little
bit more of this lovely Ambrosia?

26:20.844 --> 26:22.311
Sure.
Thank you, dear.

26:22.880 --> 26:25.849
Bill, you must be so
proud of your sons.

26:26.150 --> 26:29.586
Lee here has grown
into such a handsome man.

26:30.721 --> 26:33.884
I can only imagine
what Zak must look like now.

26:34.792 --> 26:37.886
You are the spitting image
of your mother...

26:38.195 --> 26:42.393
and I bet Zak takes
just after his daddy.

26:42.466 --> 26:45.230
Zak passed away
a couple of years ago.

26:49.139 --> 26:50.299
I'm sorry.

26:51.775 --> 26:53.743
How tragic,
the death of a child.

26:55.779 --> 26:59.271
There's been so much death,
so much pain.

27:03.854 --> 27:06.652
Sometimes it's
completely overwhelming.

27:10.594 --> 27:12.289
I'm sure he was
a beautiful boy.

27:17.601 --> 27:22.334
<i>The Captain of the Rising Star was
puzzled as to how you got on his ship.</i>

27:22.439 --> 27:26.341
I know. I know some thoughtful
soul just rescued me...

27:26.443 --> 27:31.380
from almost certain death, and put
me on the last flight out of Picon.

27:32.016 --> 27:34.678
How lucky for us all.
Yes, indeed.

27:34.785 --> 27:37.686
The strange thing is
no one can recall...

27:37.821 --> 27:40.881
giving you any medical
assistance until about a week ago.

27:40.991 --> 27:43.323
I know.

27:45.262 --> 27:47.355
It's a miracle I'm alive.

27:49.733 --> 27:53.225
I think I better clear
some of these dishes.

27:54.104 --> 27:58.006
You are so sweet. Very good.
My compliments to the chef.

27:58.676 --> 28:01.611
So, Bill, now the question
on everyone's mind...

28:02.880 --> 28:04.507
and I do mean everyone...

28:04.581 --> 28:06.048
Sorry. It's okay.

28:08.018 --> 28:12.352
...is where is Earth
and when do we get there?

28:14.758 --> 28:19.286
That's classified information.
That word again.

28:19.396 --> 28:20.454
Leave the man alone.

28:20.564 --> 28:23.965
Come on, if there are no
privileges of being an XO's wife...

28:24.068 --> 28:25.831
then what's the point?

28:25.936 --> 28:28.905
Bill, we're all family here.
Come on.

28:29.306 --> 28:32.002
The need for secrecy
is paramount, Ellen.

28:33.377 --> 28:37.677
I'm sorry. Perhaps you don't know
that the Cylons look like us now.

28:38.982 --> 28:41.974
That, yes, I knew that.

28:42.252 --> 28:46.348
It's recent news. Most people
found out a few days ago.

28:52.162 --> 28:55.325
A thing like that
would travel fast. Right?

28:56.633 --> 28:58.999
Any one of us
could be a Cylon.

29:06.477 --> 29:07.637
Boo!

29:11.682 --> 29:14.378
Did you see the looks
on their faces?

29:15.352 --> 29:19.846
You are too easy.
Thank you so much for coming.

29:22.426 --> 29:24.758
It's been a wonderful evening.

29:28.699 --> 29:30.860
Thought it would never end.

29:32.069 --> 29:36.005
I seemed to have
lost one of my shoes.

29:36.073 --> 29:39.372
I think it's right here.
Thank you.

29:40.744 --> 29:41.836
Here we are.

29:41.912 --> 29:45.006
You look very, very happy.
That's because I am very happy.

29:45.082 --> 29:46.447
Thank you.

29:51.488 --> 29:56.448
It was nice to see you again.
The pleasure's all mine.

29:57.628 --> 30:00.893
Hope to see you soon.
I'm sure you will.

30:08.639 --> 30:10.402
Hang on.

30:13.610 --> 30:14.804
Watch your step.

30:14.912 --> 30:16.277
Good night.
Lovely evening.

30:16.346 --> 30:19.281
I've got her.
Be careful.

30:26.423 --> 30:29.324
You actually think
that woman is a Cylon?

30:29.693 --> 30:33.026
If she's not, then we're
all in a lot of trouble.

30:35.165 --> 30:38.225
When did Bill become
such a stick-in-the-mud?

30:39.069 --> 30:40.900
The man's a carving.

30:42.473 --> 30:45.340
He's one of those faces
on a totem pole.

30:48.245 --> 30:51.078
The scuttlebutt was that she slept
with more than half the fleet...

30:51.148 --> 30:52.308
while Saul was in space.

30:52.716 --> 30:54.650
Why the hell did
he stay married to her?

30:54.718 --> 30:58.313
It's obvious. He loves
her deeply. Blindly.

30:58.922 --> 31:01.823
Ellen used to encourage the
worst instincts in this guy...

31:01.892 --> 31:05.828
bring out this self destructive
streak in him. Used to?

31:13.470 --> 31:16.303
Sharon, stop! I can't keep up.

31:31.588 --> 31:34.716
Helo, come on.

31:37.427 --> 31:39.554
You can do it.
You can. Please.

31:41.131 --> 31:42.621
You have to get up.

31:47.337 --> 31:49.134
There. Right there.

32:17.167 --> 32:18.361
Turn your light off.

32:43.961 --> 32:46.794
We gotta find another way
out of here. We're going.

32:46.897 --> 32:50.196
Why aren't you waiting?
You keep going and going.

32:50.267 --> 32:53.031
You never get tired.
It's adrenaline.

32:53.804 --> 32:57.570
I'm not gonna die here. And I'm
not gonna let you die here either.

32:57.641 --> 32:59.472
Okay, let's go!

33:10.853 --> 33:13.515
Don't worry, I'll
get us home. Yeah, right.

33:14.523 --> 33:18.357
Just like Bill's getting us
to Earth. Don't start on Bill.

33:21.864 --> 33:25.493
He doesn't have the slightest
idea where Earth is.

33:25.568 --> 33:28.901
You don't have to yell
it through the halls.

33:29.538 --> 33:33.338
Bill Adama doesn't
know where Earth is!

33:33.709 --> 33:35.836
Colonel.
Doctor.

33:38.814 --> 33:42.910
Actually, I don't believe
I've had the pleasure.

33:43.319 --> 33:47.221
I'm Dr. Gaius... Baltar.
I know exactly who you are.

33:48.858 --> 33:51.088
And the pleasure's all mine.

33:54.664 --> 33:56.894
Something here, isn't there?

33:57.400 --> 34:00.028
You're still holding my hand.
That's funny.

34:00.102 --> 34:02.696
I thought you were
still holding onto mine.

34:02.772 --> 34:05.434
I'm watching you. Both of you.

34:05.708 --> 34:08.199
And you should
be watching her.

34:10.546 --> 34:12.571
Care to join us
for a nightcap, Doctor?

34:14.750 --> 34:16.217
I'd love to.

34:16.285 --> 34:18.651
<i>Dr. Baltar,
please report to the lab.</i>

34:18.721 --> 34:20.086
<i>The Commander
is waiting for you.</i>

34:20.156 --> 34:24.593
But I can't. Another time,
perhaps. Count on it.

34:26.262 --> 34:27.456
Ta-ta!

34:30.900 --> 34:35.269
Oh, Saulie, are you jealous?
You said we were starting over.

34:35.604 --> 34:39.631
We are, sweetheart, we are. That was
just a little bit of harmless flirting.

34:39.709 --> 34:40.698
No.

34:47.116 --> 34:49.243
You should know something.
What?

34:51.120 --> 34:53.213
In the middle of dinner...

34:55.691 --> 35:00.185
Bill put his hand on my leg.
Ellen, I'm not falling for this.

35:03.866 --> 35:08.667
<i>Did you know he came to
see me on the Rising Star?</i>

35:09.872 --> 35:10.964
What?

35:11.040 --> 35:14.703
He'd come into my room.
I'd pretend to be asleep.

35:16.011 --> 35:18.741
Then he'd sit by
the side of my bed...

35:20.382 --> 35:24.443
and then he'd touch me. Why are
you doing this? You're lying.

35:26.756 --> 35:30.248
I am not! He was on that ship.

35:31.293 --> 35:33.090
I'll prove it.

35:36.065 --> 35:37.362
Come on!

35:40.770 --> 35:42.965
Look, it's not magic.
It's science.

35:43.072 --> 35:45.404
If you want the right result,
you have to wait a while.

35:45.474 --> 35:47.066
I gave you
her sample this morning.

35:47.143 --> 35:50.044
I have started and stopped
the test twice already now...

35:50.112 --> 35:51.477
so I'm running
a little behind.

35:51.580 --> 35:53.810
Twice?
My fault. Long story.

35:53.916 --> 35:54.974
Your fault?

35:55.084 --> 35:57.416
I shouldn't have mentioned
that. You shouldn't have.

35:57.486 --> 36:00.046
Did you tell him to stop
Ellen's test? Yes, I did.

36:00.122 --> 36:02.420
Why?
I had some concerns.

36:02.491 --> 36:03.583
About what?

36:03.659 --> 36:07.925
In all honesty, I think it's fair to say
that your behavior recently has been odd.

36:07.997 --> 36:10.295
My behavior? What do you
think, I'm a Cylon? Me?

36:10.366 --> 36:12.834
You can't deny that
you've been making these...

36:12.935 --> 36:15.802
off-log calls, these
mysterious trips off the ship.

36:15.871 --> 36:17.304
Where did you hear that?

36:17.373 --> 36:19.967
Have you been spying on me?
On my own ship?

36:20.042 --> 36:22.772
Ladies and gentlemen, please.
We're in a laboratory.

36:22.845 --> 36:25.313
There are hazardous
chemical compounds everywhere.

36:25.381 --> 36:28.475
That's a thermo-nuclear bomb,
for frack's sakes.

36:29.051 --> 36:32.817
What do you mean "un-logged"?
"Mysterious trips"? What's going on?

36:32.888 --> 36:35.880
<i>I had to go to the Rising Star
and I didn't want Tigh to know.</i>

36:35.991 --> 36:37.049
Why not?

36:37.126 --> 36:40.254
Because whether or not his wife is
a Cylon, she's nothing but trouble...

36:40.329 --> 36:42.957
and I wanted to keep her away
from him as long as I could.

36:43.032 --> 36:45.000
Then why did you bring her
aboard the ship?

36:45.067 --> 36:48.264
Because she's his wife. And
I couldn't refuse her access...

36:48.370 --> 36:50.930
to her own husband
without causing suspicion.

36:51.040 --> 36:53.235
Besides,
I wanted her close to me.

36:53.342 --> 36:57.176
I told you.
I told you he wanted me.

36:57.246 --> 36:59.271
Lovely.
What the hell's going on?

36:59.381 --> 37:02.441
You have been
secretly visiting my wife?

37:02.551 --> 37:06.078
No. Yes. But it's complicated.

37:06.188 --> 37:09.589
I told you. He's been
after me for years. What?

37:09.692 --> 37:12.388
Now, boys, boys, don't
fight over little old me.

37:12.461 --> 37:14.691
Ellen, be quiet!
You don't tell me what to do.

37:14.763 --> 37:17.425
We should all take a
deep breath. I will!

37:17.533 --> 37:21.629
I was afraid that she might be a Cylon! I
brought her blood here to have it tested.

37:21.737 --> 37:24.968
That's why you cancelled your
test. How'd you know about that?

37:25.074 --> 37:28.009
You didn't tell me
he was testing my wife.

37:29.011 --> 37:34.005
You met with the President? Yes.
She thought you might be a Cylon.

37:37.686 --> 37:38.948
I know.

37:39.889 --> 37:42.619
<i>Attention.
Pass the word for the Commander...</i>

37:42.691 --> 37:43.715
<i>the XO and the CAG.</i>

37:43.792 --> 37:47.728
<i>Comdr. Adama, Col. Tigh, and
Captain Adama, please report to CIC.</i>

37:55.104 --> 37:56.469
Mr. Gaeta.

37:56.839 --> 37:59.865
The Raider smoothed out its
flight path about two minutes ago.

37:59.975 --> 38:01.533
It seems to be under control.

38:01.644 --> 38:04.875
Yeah, but he's not jumping
for home. No, sir, he isn't.

38:04.980 --> 38:07.972
Has our reconnaissance detected
any outgoing communications...

38:08.050 --> 38:10.177
since he straightened
out his flight pattern?

38:10.252 --> 38:13.881
Yes, sir, but it's likely it's
just another distress signal.

38:19.595 --> 38:21.722
Launch the alert fighters.

38:27.569 --> 38:29.730
This is the CAG.
Launch the alert fighters.

38:29.838 --> 38:33.934
Sir, I hate to tell you this, but I think
it's been playing with us the entire time...

38:34.043 --> 38:35.874
just waiting to see
how we'd react.

38:35.945 --> 38:37.936
Playing with us?
Yeah.

38:38.047 --> 38:40.948
Order the flight leader to
destroy the target! Yes, sir.

38:42.785 --> 38:44.912
<i>Galactica, Hot Dog.
The Raider just took off!</i>

38:45.020 --> 38:47.853
He doesn't look injured to me.
He's heading back to the fleet!

38:47.923 --> 38:51.415
<i>They're not going to catch him.
Action Stations, set Condition One.</i>

38:51.493 --> 38:54.553
<i>This is not a drill.
He doesn't have any weapons.</i>

38:54.630 --> 38:56.564
He's on a suicide run.

39:14.483 --> 39:19.011
Did you launch the alert
fighters? It was the XO's call.

39:21.590 --> 39:24.753
I had a hunch.
Good call.

39:29.765 --> 39:31.790
One question.
Because I was worried.

39:31.867 --> 39:34.233
That she might be a Cylon.
And if she wasn't?

39:34.336 --> 39:38.067
I know how you feel about her, Saul.
She's been a negative force in your life.

39:38.173 --> 39:39.572
I'm sorry, but it's the truth.

39:39.675 --> 39:42.075
Maybe she was.
Everything was different then.

39:42.177 --> 39:44.737
She was different.
I was different.

39:44.980 --> 39:48.143
I've grown accustomed to seeing
you without the cup in your hand.

39:48.217 --> 39:50.583
So I had a couple
of drinks tonight.

39:50.686 --> 39:54.486
I was celebrating. I think
I deserved to... Yes, you did.

39:55.190 --> 39:57.215
Launching those
fighters on a hunch.

39:59.461 --> 40:00.621
You saved our ship.

40:07.736 --> 40:11.001
Just doing my job.
You do your job good.

40:11.173 --> 40:15.906
That's why I need you, Saul.
That, and that we're friends.

40:16.211 --> 40:19.203
I don't want anything to come
between that, not even Ellen.

40:19.281 --> 40:20.612
It won't.

40:27.122 --> 40:31.058
We've searched
every street, every building.

40:33.595 --> 40:35.563
They slipped through.
How's that possible?

40:35.631 --> 40:38.691
She thinks she loves him now.
That she can't live without him.

40:39.234 --> 40:42.169
Her passion is making
her more resourceful.

40:44.573 --> 40:48.065
It bothers you, doesn't it?
We'll get them in the end.

40:49.344 --> 40:52.404
No, it bothers you that
you've never experienced it.

40:54.383 --> 40:57.181
You saw the way Helo was
when we took her away?

40:57.886 --> 40:59.547
He was pathetic.

41:02.791 --> 41:07.125
I can't help wondering what it
would be like to feel that intensely.

41:09.865 --> 41:12.095
Even in his anguish,
he seemed...

41:13.769 --> 41:14.895
so alive.

41:32.187 --> 41:37.090
Green. Green, everyone.

41:38.227 --> 41:40.752
Mrs. Tigh is definitely human.

41:44.900 --> 41:49.462
No hard feelings, I hope,
Ellen. I completely understand.

41:50.305 --> 41:52.535
But let's be sure
and test you next.

41:52.608 --> 41:56.237
Doctor?
My pleasure. My job.

41:59.414 --> 42:03.248
You don't want to frack with
me, Bill. Try to remember that.

42:05.454 --> 42:07.945
Don't frack
with me either, Ellen.

42:11.593 --> 42:15.324
If only they knew that
everyone passes these days.

42:15.964 --> 42:18.524
Why, it's so much
simpler that way.

42:18.967 --> 42:20.662
No muss, no fuss.

42:28.443 --> 42:30.707
What did her test really say?

42:33.048 --> 42:34.709
I'll never tell.
