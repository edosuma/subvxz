ACCORDING TO POLINA,

27:57.718 --> 27:59.549

AN ONLINE SUPPORT GROUP.

27:59.762 --> 28:01.093
THEY SUGGESTED A CHAT ROOM

28:01.305 --> 28:03.717
WHERE WE MIGHT FIND SOMEONE
TO TAKE POLINA.

28:04.892 --> 28:06.473
WHO DID YOU FIND?

28:06.686 --> 28:08.927
A WOMAN NAMED PRISCILLA GUNTHER
OVER IN DURANT.

28:09.147 --> 28:10.808

SHE AND HER HUSBAND, ART,

28:11.023 --> 28:13.480
HAD RAISED A BUNCH
OF TROUBLED RUSSIAN KIDS ALREADY

28:13.693 --> 28:15.433
AND HAD ROOM
TO TAKE IN ANOTHER ONE.

28:15.653 --> 28:18.440
SO WE PUT POLINA IN THE CAR,
AND WE DROVE UP TO DURANT,

28:18.656 --> 28:20.647
AND WE RE-HOMED HER
WITH THE GUNTHERS.

28:20.867 --> 28:22.403

YOU HAD JUST MET ONLINE?

28:22.618 --> 28:25.234
WE WERE DESPERATE. IT SEEMED
LIKE THEY COULD HANDLE HER.

I MEAN, THERE'S NO LAW AGAINST
RE-HOMING A KID LIKE POLINA.

28:28.708 --> 28:31.370
UNLESS, OF COURSE, THE GUNTHERS
TURN OUT TO BE SEXUAL PREDATORS.

28:31.586 --> 28:33.451
THEY WERE NOTHING
LIKE THAT.

28:33.671 --> 28:36.333

A PSYCHOLOGY DEGREE.

WE WOULDN'T HAVE LEFT POLINA --

TAKE PLACE?
