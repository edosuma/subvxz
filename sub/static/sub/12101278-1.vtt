M_I_SForEver

00:48.783 --> 00:50.785
Should we do something tonight?

00:50.818 --> 00:52.620
We should.
We should finish packing.

00:52.654 --> 00:55.222
I can't,
I'm too tired.

00:55.255 --> 00:56.356
Tough day?

00:56.390 --> 00:57.859
No. I made lattes.

00:57.892 --> 00:59.694
We really should leave
by 8 tomorrow,

00:59.727 --> 01:00.828
I don't want to get stuck
in traffic.

01:00.862 --> 01:02.830
You sound like your dad.

01:02.864 --> 01:07.334
Why was
the squirrel late for work?

01:07.367 --> 01:10.572
Because traffic was nuts.

01:10.605 --> 01:12.406
Oh, boo!

01:12.439 --> 01:14.241
Wait,
you don't like that one? I got more.

01:14.274 --> 01:17.444
If I promise we'll be
in the car by 8, will you stop?

01:17.477 --> 01:20.113
Mm-hm.

01:20.147 --> 01:23.216
- Hey.
- I read the book you recommended.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.451
- Mm...
- Oh, yeah?

01:24.484 --> 01:26.153
I didn't like it.

01:26.186 --> 01:28.890
Your food will be ready
in five minutes.

01:28.923 --> 01:30.190
Thanks.

01:32.359 --> 01:33.427
She did not like it.

01:33.460 --> 01:34.562
She mean.

01:41.502 --> 01:44.137
No? I'm hungry.

01:44.171 --> 01:47.374
Well, I mean, we could order
some Chinese take-out,

01:47.407 --> 01:48.676
you know,
if you're hungry.

01:48.710 --> 01:51.713
Wow, what a suggestion.
Thank you.

01:51.746 --> 01:53.781
Yeah, you're welcome.
It's just a thought.

01:56.884 --> 01:59.353
- Oh.
- Oh?

01:59.386 --> 02:00.487
What's happening?

02:00.521 --> 02:02.824
I don't know.
What is happening?

02:02.857 --> 02:05.927
Oh, it is.
You like this.

02:12.700 --> 02:15.402
Stupid.

02:15.435 --> 02:17.605
- Am I embarrassing you?
- Mm-hm.

02:17.639 --> 02:20.173
I can do this all day.

02:22.644 --> 02:23.711
Marry me.

05:07.909 --> 05:08.910
Hey...

05:08.943 --> 05:11.579
Morning.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.313
Can we at least
talk about last night?

05:16.117 --> 05:18.052
You should get dressed,
we gotta get on the road.

05:20.788 --> 05:22.657
- Doug.
- Lori.

05:24.892 --> 05:28.129
You can't possibly think
you're coming, you dumped me.

05:28.162 --> 05:29.964
Uh, yeah I am.
I'm in the wedding.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.866
You're barely in
the wedding.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.835
I'm the King of the Ushers.

05:36.671 --> 05:39.874
Well, it's my sister.
You're not coming.

05:43.678 --> 05:47.114
Do we really need
all this shit?

05:47.148 --> 05:49.449
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, we do.

05:59.160 --> 06:00.427
Bea texted.

06:05.132 --> 06:06.499
What are you gonna tell her?

06:10.805 --> 06:11.873
- Hey, did I press play?
- Yeah.

06:11.906 --> 06:13.741
- I'm sorry, I...
- Yes!

06:13.774 --> 06:15.977
I know, but I just keep taking
pictures instead of video.

06:16.010 --> 06:19.180
- Um, hey, I'm Jayson
- I'm Bea, I'm on a boat!

06:19.213 --> 06:20.715
Baby, you don't have to be
that loud.

06:20.748 --> 06:22.717
- What? Wait...
- Okay, we're excited.

06:22.750 --> 06:26.419
Anyways, I know this is, uh,
probably gonna be a little strange, um,

06:26.453 --> 06:27.889
but... but here goes nothing.

06:27.922 --> 06:30.858
Four weeks ago,
I was at the Sydney airport,

06:30.892 --> 06:33.661
and I heard this person going
on and on and on...

06:33.694 --> 06:35.529
No, I wasn't.
I was just talking.

06:35.563 --> 06:37.865
I'm simply talking about
playing Skee-Ball at

06:37.899 --> 06:40.034
the Lake of the Ozarks
in Missouri, so...

06:40.067 --> 06:42.770
Which is exactly what
I used to do when I was a kid,

06:42.803 --> 06:45.506
and I'd never met ev...
ever met anyone else

06:45.539 --> 06:47.875
- who would ever know what Lake of the Ozarks is.
- Lake of the Ozarks!

06:47.909 --> 06:50.778
Okay, so this is not
just an introduction,

06:50.811 --> 06:51.946
'cause like I said,
I am Bea.

06:51.979 --> 06:53.180
- Yep.
- Beatrice.

06:53.214 --> 06:55.116
Yeah, and I'm Jayson.
Jayson.

06:55.149 --> 06:57.852
It's also an announcement.
'Cause we're getting married!

06:57.885 --> 06:59.787
- Yeah, so we're getting married.
- We're getting married!

06:59.820 --> 07:02.790
Okay,
so when the video ends,

07:02.823 --> 07:05.192
that'll be my grand entrance
to my favorite song.

07:05.226 --> 07:06.827
"Pony," by Ginuwine.

07:06.861 --> 07:08.896
Yeah, with a G.

07:08.930 --> 07:10.631
Perfect.

07:10.665 --> 07:12.166
We're just so thrilled
that you've chosen

07:12.199 --> 07:14.769
the Arrowhead Pines Lodge
for your special day.

07:14.802 --> 07:17.104
Well, Bea loved it here when
it was a summer camp, so...

07:17.138 --> 07:19.941
I always thought my wedding
should be fun, you know?

07:19.974 --> 07:21.642
And what is more fun than
getting married

07:21.676 --> 07:25.146
at the place where you got
your first period?

07:47.601 --> 07:49.203
Hi. We have a reservation.

07:49.236 --> 07:51.172
- Name?
- But...

07:51.205 --> 07:54.275
um, we just...
we have a king bed and we need two beds.

07:54.308 --> 07:55.576
Please.

08:02.316 --> 08:04.685
Yeah, thing is,
we're fully booked.

08:04.719 --> 08:06.687
We have a wedding
this weekend.

08:06.721 --> 08:08.022
Yes, I am aware,
it is my sister's wedding.

08:08.055 --> 08:09.657
No, we'll just keep
the suite.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.125
What are you gonna do,
sleep on the floor?

08:11.158 --> 08:13.094
Can't you just, like,
upgrade someone else?

08:13.127 --> 08:15.262
We'll take whatever.

08:15.296 --> 08:17.531
I can switch you guys
over to a cabin.

08:17.565 --> 08:18.632
Great.

08:18.666 --> 08:20.267
They're not heated, though.

08:20.301 --> 08:21.902
Who needs heat.

08:21.936 --> 08:23.904
Okay, well, I have to
type all of this in,

08:23.938 --> 08:25.606
so it's gonna be
a couple hours.

08:25.639 --> 08:28.109
- Take your time.
- Okay.

08:31.912 --> 08:33.114
Oh, shit.

08:35.049 --> 08:38.284
- You ready for this?
- No.

08:38.318 --> 08:40.187
Neither am I.

08:40.221 --> 08:41.655
Run.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.924
- Ah! Oh, my God!
- Oh, my... Hey.

08:43.957 --> 08:46.794
- Mom!
- Hi. My favorite couple.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.329
- Hey.
- How are you?

08:48.362 --> 08:50.865
I thought you guys were gonna
get here earlier.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.299
We were hoping to
have lunch with you,

08:52.333 --> 08:55.102
but your grandparents
got hungry at 10:30.

08:55.136 --> 08:57.872
Oh, well, you know,
we were, um, delayed.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.106
Anyway...

08:59.140 --> 09:01.275
What happened?

09:01.308 --> 09:04.645
We, uh...

09:04.678 --> 09:06.981
Uh, we... we, uh...
we hit a bird.

09:07.014 --> 09:09.850
Oh, no. Is it okay?

09:11.619 --> 09:12.887
It's dead.

09:14.688 --> 09:15.723
It's so nice to see you.

09:15.756 --> 09:18.125
You too.
Oh, God.

09:20.394 --> 09:24.298
Ugh! They get engaged after
a couple of days.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.734
She wants to get married
at her old summer camp.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.636
Oh, well, I think it's
kinda cool to get married at...

09:28.669 --> 09:31.172
There are friendship bracelets
in the welcome bags.

09:31.205 --> 09:33.107
Mom, you promised.

09:36.744 --> 09:39.113
They'll be through
by Christmas.

09:39.146 --> 09:41.082
Watch.

09:41.115 --> 09:43.217
- Hey, sis. What's up?
- Hi.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.653
Lori, good to see you.

09:45.686 --> 09:46.854
- Dougie.
- Hey, man, what's up?

09:46.887 --> 09:48.722
- Hey.
- Oh, boy. All right.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.691
- Yeah.
- Hey!

09:50.724 --> 09:53.294
- Oh, man.
- It's so great to finally meet you.

09:53.327 --> 09:55.763
- Yeah.
- Gosh. Hey, um, the wedding planner

09:55.796 --> 09:59.300
absolutely loved your ribbon
on the chair idea, so...

09:59.333 --> 10:01.168
A lot of people like ribbon.

10:01.202 --> 10:04.405
Yeah, I mean, I...
I personally love ribbons.

10:04.438 --> 10:08.075
I think I see Aunt Jean.

10:08.109 --> 10:10.010
You're here!
You're here!

10:10.044 --> 10:11.345
- There she is, there she is.
- Oh, my God, you're here.

10:11.378 --> 10:12.913
- Hi.
- Oh, my God.

10:12.947 --> 10:14.048
A little excited
to see her sister.

10:14.081 --> 10:15.816
- A little bit.
- Yeah.

10:15.850 --> 10:17.718
- Look at your hair.
- Oh, yeah. Check this out.

10:17.751 --> 10:19.286
Oh, wow.

10:19.320 --> 10:21.355
So I rented a store front.
I'm launching, like,

10:21.388 --> 10:23.157
as soon as I get back from
the honeymoon.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.126
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on.
Wait. Launching what?

10:25.159 --> 10:26.293
Scrunchies.

10:26.327 --> 10:28.362
Bespoke scrunchies.

10:28.395 --> 10:30.898
- Seriously?
- Yeah. Jay's an early investor.

10:30.931 --> 10:33.033
You gotta get in on
the ground floor.

10:33.067 --> 10:34.401
And I screwed that up with
the Honest Company.

10:34.435 --> 10:37.705
Friggin' Jessica Alba.
Genius.

10:37.738 --> 10:40.040
Okay, I was gonna wait until
the day of the wedding,

10:40.074 --> 10:41.408
but here you go.

10:41.442 --> 10:46.180
Oh, my God.
Oh. Oh, hey.

10:46.213 --> 10:48.182
So everyone knows
you're my maid of honor.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.050
Yeah, I lo...
I love it.

10:50.084 --> 10:51.452
- Yeah?
- It's beautiful.

10:51.485 --> 10:52.953
- I put it on like this?
- Please.

10:52.987 --> 10:56.824
Okay.
Yeah, you like?

10:56.857 --> 10:59.760
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:59.793 --> 11:01.061
It looks really great.

11:02.897 --> 11:06.333
God. God, I love this hoodie.
I love how old it looks.

11:06.367 --> 11:07.935
Did it come that way?

11:07.968 --> 11:09.770
No, it's just old.

11:09.803 --> 11:11.338
- Hm. Like Jay?
- Yeah.

11:11.372 --> 11:12.973
- What'd you just say?
- Nothing.

11:13.007 --> 11:15.009
- She called you old, man.
- Oh...

11:15.042 --> 11:18.312
Guilty. I am older than her,
this is true.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.848
Hey, what suite
are you guys staying in?

11:20.881 --> 11:22.216
- Uh...
- Oh, uh, we actually...

11:22.249 --> 11:23.384
We switched to one of
the cabins.

11:23.417 --> 11:25.386
- Oh... cozy.
- Ah, fine.

11:25.419 --> 11:27.121
But we can't get in for a couple of
hours, so we're...

11:27.154 --> 11:28.489
- What?
- Yeah.

11:28.523 --> 11:30.858
Let me go talk to Mike.

11:30.891 --> 11:32.026
Go get 'em, baby.

11:34.328 --> 11:37.798
U...

11:37.831 --> 11:39.266
Where's the N?

11:39.300 --> 11:40.734
Hey, Mike.

11:40.768 --> 11:42.236
- Oh, what's up?
- What's up?

11:42.269 --> 11:45.339
Hey, um,
did you cut your hair?

11:45.372 --> 11:46.974
No, it's just behind
my shoulders.

11:47.007 --> 11:48.175
Ah, see, before,
you had it in the front.

11:48.209 --> 11:49.843
- Yeah.
- In the front.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.979
So, my brother and sister
just got here.

11:52.012 --> 11:53.814
- They need a room.
- Right.

11:53.847 --> 11:56.350
Yeah, they... can they get...
can they get one now?

11:56.383 --> 11:58.219
Yeah, I told them I could maybe
switch 'em to a cabin.

11:58.252 --> 12:00.120
- Oh, sweet.
- Yeah, they got...

12:00.154 --> 12:02.756
You got... Do you have...
Can they... Can they get a key?

12:02.790 --> 12:05.025
Yeah, yeah, I got a couple,
I have, uh, Red Rover,

12:05.059 --> 12:07.494
Hopscotch, and
Duck, Duck, Goose.

12:07.529 --> 12:09.230
Which one do you recommend?

12:09.263 --> 12:10.532
- Duck, Duck, Goose.
- Sweet.

12:10.565 --> 12:12.299
- Red Rover's haunted.
- What?

12:12.333 --> 12:13.834
- Yeah.
- Nice.

12:15.570 --> 12:18.105
Cha-ching! You guys are in
Duck, Duck, Goose.

12:18.138 --> 12:20.908
All right. Uh,
what does that mean?

12:20.941 --> 12:22.243
I guess you'll find out.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.412
Oh, look, honey,
it's Dominic.

12:25.446 --> 12:27.881
- Which one's Dominic?
- Dominic, my Peace Corps buddy.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.416
- From Swaziland.
- What...

12:29.450 --> 12:31.018
- Dude has six toes.
- Oh, my God, yes!

12:31.051 --> 12:32.319
Yeah, I know,
it's so gross.

12:32.353 --> 12:33.954
Let's...
Let's go talk to him.

12:33.988 --> 12:35.422
This is just gonna be
so much easier

12:35.456 --> 12:36.524
when it's you two
getting married.

12:36.558 --> 12:38.359
You already know everyone.

12:38.392 --> 12:39.460
Hi.

13:39.286 --> 13:40.821
A lot of fuckin' ducks
in here.

13:47.127 --> 13:50.431
And it is, technically,
two beds.

13:50.464 --> 13:52.032
I'm gonna take a shower.

14:33.941 --> 14:36.143
Hey, do you mind if
I wash my hands before you...

15:35.102 --> 15:36.103
Five minutes.

15:36.136 --> 15:37.271
Cool.

15:39.373 --> 15:41.475
- You feelin' okay?
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

15:41.509 --> 15:44.044
I just gotta, um...

15:44.077 --> 15:46.046
Yeah, uh, bathroom.

15:58.459 --> 16:00.127
Lori.

16:00.160 --> 16:03.531
Hey, it's, uh, Eric.
I'm Bea's friend.

16:03.565 --> 16:05.165
From back in high school.

16:05.199 --> 16:06.333
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

16:06.366 --> 16:07.635
- What's up?
- Eric, hi.

16:07.669 --> 16:09.236
- Hey.
- Oh, my God, you're an adult.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.038
- Yeah, yeah.
- And you're very tall.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.340
Yeah.
What's up?

16:13.373 --> 16:14.576
- Hi.
- Hey.

16:32.627 --> 16:34.094
All right.

16:34.127 --> 16:36.196
So, uh, tell me what
you've been up to?

16:36.230 --> 16:38.465
Um... not much, man,

16:38.499 --> 16:42.202
I'm just still working at
my dad's landscaping company.

16:42.236 --> 16:47.074
Just gettin' baked
and mowing lawns and...

16:47.107 --> 16:48.408
So, just like high school?

16:48.442 --> 16:50.578
Just like high school.

16:50.612 --> 16:52.212
Um, what about you?

16:52.246 --> 16:53.548
I work at a coffee shop.

16:53.581 --> 16:57.484
Nice. As, like,
a manager or...

16:57.519 --> 16:59.286
No.

16:59.319 --> 17:00.588
Oh...

17:02.256 --> 17:05.259
God, Lori fuckin' Anderson.

17:05.291 --> 17:07.261
It's good to see you.

17:07.294 --> 17:09.096
Good to see you, too.

17:15.335 --> 17:17.638
Oh, shit. Whoa!

17:17.672 --> 17:19.540
Sorry. Um...

17:19.574 --> 17:21.108
Sorry, everybody.

17:21.141 --> 17:23.076
- Uh...
- Go, Doug!

17:23.109 --> 17:25.378
Technical difficulties.
I'm so sorry.

17:25.412 --> 17:27.749
Uh...

17:28.883 --> 17:31.485
Hi. Uh...

17:31.519 --> 17:37.157
Doug. Um, so... so Bea asked me
to... to speak this weekend,

17:37.190 --> 17:41.563
um, and given that the, uh...

17:41.596 --> 17:43.397
the best man speaks at
the wedding,

17:43.430 --> 17:45.867
and the groomsmen speak at
the rehearsal dinner,

17:45.900 --> 17:48.870
um, uh,
she wasn't exactly sure

17:48.903 --> 17:52.339
when the King of the Ushers
should speak,

17:52.372 --> 17:56.343
um, but, uh, she eventually decided
that tonight was... was safe, you know,

17:56.376 --> 18:00.615
before any of the important
out-of-town guests arrive.

18:00.648 --> 18:03.551
Um...

18:03.585 --> 18:04.719
so, um...

18:08.488 --> 18:13.327
So when... when Bea and I
first met, uh...

18:13.360 --> 18:15.429
she was drunk.

18:15.462 --> 18:19.299
She... Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, it gets worse.

18:19.333 --> 18:22.670
She was also in middle school.

18:22.704 --> 18:25.238
Um...

18:25.272 --> 18:27.140
I had, uh...

18:27.174 --> 18:30.444
I had just started dating
this... this wonderful girl,

18:30.477 --> 18:35.215
uh... Lori, and, um,

18:35.248 --> 18:37.619
we'd only been going out
for a few weeks,

18:37.652 --> 18:41.623
but she invited me to come to
her mom's house for Thanksgiving.

18:41.656 --> 18:43.591
So Lori and I were
up in her room,

18:43.625 --> 18:49.429
and we hear this...
this strange crash from outside.

18:49.463 --> 18:51.198
Oh, my God.

18:51.231 --> 18:53.935
Which is, apparently,
the sound that you make

18:53.968 --> 19:00.575
when you ride your sled into
a concrete birdbath

19:00.608 --> 19:03.276
after downing
12 Jell-O shots

19:03.310 --> 19:07.749
at your BFF's
Black Friday party.

19:07.782 --> 19:10.752
Anyway, I... I spent that...
that night in the ER

19:10.785 --> 19:13.353
with my... my new girlfriend,
and, uh...

19:13.387 --> 19:14.722
and her little sister,

19:14.756 --> 19:18.358
and we talked about
life and love,

19:18.392 --> 19:21.829
and how much it hurts
to throw up

19:21.863 --> 19:23.898
after knocking
out all your teeth.

19:23.931 --> 19:27.835
And, uh... And we bonded.

19:27.869 --> 19:32.305
And so, uh, I'm...
I'm so, so happy

19:32.339 --> 19:35.810
to... to be here to...

19:35.843 --> 19:39.212
to, uh...
to congratulate you,

19:39.246 --> 19:42.917
um, after ten years.
You know?

19:42.950 --> 19:45.887
Um, ten years as a...
as a...

19:45.920 --> 19:49.222
as a part of this family,
um...

19:49.256 --> 19:50.558
to congratulate you
on your marriage.

19:50.591 --> 19:52.827
Uh, you're...
Here's to you, Bea.

19:52.860 --> 19:55.395
You're the...

19:55.429 --> 19:57.532
the little sister
that I never had.

19:57.565 --> 20:00.233
Mmm...

20:04.672 --> 20:06.339
It was perfect.

20:06.373 --> 20:07.975
- It wasn't too much?
- No, I loved it.

20:15.315 --> 20:16.851
Where's my champagne?

20:35.368 --> 20:38.005
You okay?

20:38.039 --> 20:39.507
Oh, yeah, peachy.

20:42.610 --> 20:45.546
Yeah, I saw you leave,
I just thought that...

20:45.580 --> 20:47.314
- I got drinks.
- Hey.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.282
- Hey.
- That's for you.

20:49.316 --> 20:50.852
That one's for Dougie.

20:50.885 --> 20:53.054
And I think that's the one
with the mescaline.

20:53.087 --> 20:55.489
- Hm?
- No, I meant...

20:55.523 --> 20:58.325
mescal, I don't know,
just drink it.

20:58.358 --> 21:00.695
Hey, so, um...

21:00.728 --> 21:02.830
we needed to tell you
something, uh...

21:02.864 --> 21:05.298
Uh, yeah.

21:05.332 --> 21:07.969
Yeah, okay.
Um, we needed to t...

21:08.002 --> 21:10.004
Uh, we want to tell you...

21:10.037 --> 21:12.707
- We, uh...
- What?

21:12.740 --> 21:16.844
- That we, um...
- We...

21:16.878 --> 21:21.616
- What?
- We are so happy for you.

21:21.649 --> 21:26.020
We're so, uh... I'm just
so happy for you, sweetie.

21:26.053 --> 21:27.855
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:27.889 --> 21:29.356
You promise?

21:29.389 --> 21:31.559
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
we're just...

21:31.592 --> 21:32.994
we're so happy
for you guys.

21:33.027 --> 21:34.729
- Really?
- Totally.

21:34.762 --> 21:36.597
- Yeah.
- You're getting married, my little sister.

21:36.631 --> 21:38.633
Ahh!

21:38.666 --> 21:40.635
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

21:40.668 --> 21:42.069
I'm getting married!

21:42.103 --> 21:43.638
You sure are.

21:43.671 --> 21:47.340
What the fuck? Lori.

21:47.374 --> 21:49.877
We had a plan.

21:49.911 --> 21:52.747
Yes, I know.
I just...

21:52.780 --> 21:55.082
Come on,
she looks so happy.

21:55.116 --> 21:56.784
Okay, so then when are we
gonna tell her,

21:56.818 --> 21:58.719
like, when she's at
the rehearsal dinner,

21:58.753 --> 21:59.987
when she's walking down
the aisle?

22:00.021 --> 22:02.455
I don't know, I just...
I don't know,

22:02.489 --> 22:06.426
maybe we could just
not tell her?

22:06.459 --> 22:07.929
Maybe we could just
not tell anyone.

22:10.665 --> 22:12.800
Wait, you mean pretend
we're still together?

22:12.834 --> 22:15.136
Shh.

22:15.169 --> 22:17.738
It's just... just until
the wedding is over.

22:20.641 --> 22:22.577
- I don't know.
- Please?

22:24.111 --> 22:25.680
Please?

22:25.713 --> 22:27.915
Three days?

22:27.949 --> 22:29.784
- Three days.
- Okay, Doug, Doug,

22:29.817 --> 22:31.586
can Lori stay with me
tonight?

22:31.619 --> 22:33.420
'Cause Jayson's, like,
crashing with the guys,

22:33.453 --> 22:35.488
and just...
I don't want to be alone.

22:35.523 --> 22:37.758
Oh, yeah, sure, I was gonna
call it a night anyway.

22:37.792 --> 22:39.660
No, no, no, wait.
What time is it?

22:39.694 --> 22:41.095
Well, look, I'm beat,

22:41.128 --> 22:42.763
and we got the whole
weekend to hang.

22:42.797 --> 22:45.900
So, I'll see you...
in the morning?

22:45.933 --> 22:47.802
- Huh?
- Fine.

22:47.835 --> 22:49.402
- So hug me.
- All right.

22:49.436 --> 22:51.105
Mm-hm.

22:51.138 --> 22:53.741
Mm... All right.
Kiss Lori.

22:56.811 --> 22:59.080
Oh, my God,
so lame.

22:59.113 --> 23:00.380
Try again.

23:07.655 --> 23:09.523
Hm. So gross.

23:29.243 --> 23:31.779
Dougie!

23:31.812 --> 23:35.482
- Yo.
- Hey, come meet the guys.

23:35.516 --> 23:36.717
- Hi, bud.
- Hey, man.

23:36.751 --> 23:38.586
Come here.
Good to see ya.

23:38.619 --> 23:41.689
Hey, uh, this is Ari,
Dominic and Chaz.

23:41.722 --> 23:44.859
- This is Doug.
- Hey. Ari, best man, officiant.

23:44.892 --> 23:46.627
- Uh...
- Oh, no, I'm good.

23:46.661 --> 23:48.763
Have a seat.
Have a seat, bud.

23:48.796 --> 23:50.097
Oh, hey, nice speech.

23:50.131 --> 23:54.168
Ah, Doug, seriously,
that speech.

23:54.201 --> 23:56.137
- Oh, thanks, man.
- Yeah. Yeah, I mean,

23:56.170 --> 23:58.973
you must be in
big fuckin' trouble.

23:59.006 --> 24:00.841
What do you mean?

24:00.875 --> 24:02.076
Uh, the younger sister
getting married

24:02.109 --> 24:03.577
before the older one?

24:03.611 --> 24:05.046
That's some
Jane Austen shit.

24:05.079 --> 24:06.714
Yeah, well, you know.

24:06.747 --> 24:08.049
Lori doesn't really care
about marriage.

24:08.082 --> 24:10.151
She doesn't really care
about anything.

24:10.184 --> 24:11.752
So...

24:11.786 --> 24:13.955
Mazel. To, uh,
women who don't care.

24:17.158 --> 24:19.492
I can't believe
this fuckin' room.

24:19.527 --> 24:22.897
Mm. Well...

24:22.930 --> 24:26.067
Mom said the towels
were too thin.

24:26.100 --> 24:27.768
No.

24:27.802 --> 24:29.670
She made me drive her to
Bed Bath & Beyond

24:29.704 --> 24:31.572
- to get a new set.
- No!

24:31.605 --> 24:32.974
The worst.

24:33.007 --> 24:34.075
I know.

24:36.277 --> 24:37.945
Do you think if she had us
when she was older,

24:37.979 --> 24:40.247
we'd be less fucked up?

24:40.281 --> 24:43.851
Mm... no.
We'd still be nuts.

24:43.884 --> 24:44.986
You nut.

24:45.019 --> 24:48.189
Yerp, yerp!

24:48.222 --> 24:51.726
We've discussed this
and it's a singular yerp.

24:51.759 --> 24:54.862
It's utter nonsense,
and not a real word.

24:54.895 --> 24:56.897
What are you doing here?

24:56.931 --> 24:58.599
I didn't think you came in
until tomorrow.

24:58.632 --> 25:00.735
- I took a sick day.
- Of course you did.

25:00.768 --> 25:02.136
- Yes.
- Of course you did.

25:02.169 --> 25:04.171
This is... Guys,
this is Roya.

25:04.205 --> 25:05.573
- Hello.
- My friend from work, Roya.

25:07.208 --> 25:08.876
- Hi. Nice to meet you, hi.
- These are the fellas.

25:08.909 --> 25:10.911
- Hi. Hi.
- Roya.

25:10.945 --> 25:12.313
Now you get to do
Paul Bunyan Day.

25:12.346 --> 25:15.649
- Yes, Paul Bunyan Day.
- Yes!

25:15.683 --> 25:17.284
Should I know
who that is?

25:17.318 --> 25:18.552
Are you serious?

25:18.586 --> 25:21.322
Very serious, yes.

25:21.355 --> 25:24.125
Oh, well, uh, yeah,
he's... he's like the, uh...

25:24.158 --> 25:27.194
the most important character
in American folklore.

25:27.228 --> 25:28.696
- Really?
- Yeah.

25:28.729 --> 25:31.298
Yeah, he's a 20 foot tall
lumberjack.

25:31.332 --> 25:33.801
And his best friend is
a big blue ox.

25:33.834 --> 25:37.304
- He loved pancakes.
- Well, that doesn't help at all.

25:37.338 --> 25:40.808
All right, and tomorrow is,
uh, his day.

25:40.841 --> 25:45.212
Well, I mean, it's really just
an excuse to play drinking games,

25:45.246 --> 25:47.581
but, yeah.

25:49.617 --> 25:50.985
I stopped taking
birth control.

25:54.622 --> 25:57.224
That's... soon.

25:57.258 --> 25:59.760
I know, but I want to
create life, man.

25:59.794 --> 26:02.063
Can you even imagine?

26:02.096 --> 26:03.964
When Jayson talks about
his son being born,

26:03.998 --> 26:07.268
he's like...

26:07.301 --> 26:09.937
I don't know,
he, like, tears up.

26:09.970 --> 26:11.338
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen

26:11.372 --> 26:13.207
in my entire life.

26:13.240 --> 26:15.142
- How old is he?
- Nine.

26:15.176 --> 26:16.877
He's the fuckin' best.

26:20.347 --> 26:22.883
No part of you that thinks
about having kids with Doug?

26:26.020 --> 26:28.222
I don't know, I just...
I got this...

26:28.255 --> 26:32.059
I thought it was, like,
an in the future thing.

26:32.093 --> 26:33.928
I know, but what does he
think about that?

26:37.431 --> 26:40.334
Do you want another drink?

26:40.367 --> 26:42.203
Yes.

26:42.236 --> 26:43.871
Me, too.

28:13.327 --> 28:17.731
- Oh, man.
- This was Lori at her junior prom.

28:17.765 --> 28:19.833
- Look at that dress.
- Wow.

28:19.867 --> 28:22.836
She insisted on buying one
from a thrift store.

28:22.870 --> 28:26.774
Her mother was
apoplectic.

28:26.807 --> 28:29.376
Ooh, speak of the devil.

28:29.410 --> 28:31.979
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:32.012 --> 28:35.182
I was, uh, just telling your
mom that you wanted to sleep in.

28:36.951 --> 28:38.886
Did you have
a lot of drinks last night?

28:38.919 --> 28:40.187
What?

28:40.221 --> 28:41.488
Oh, we were just
telling Doug

28:41.523 --> 28:43.924
about the new house
in Asheville.

28:43.958 --> 28:46.227
You gotta see it, honey,
it's a real beaut.

28:46.260 --> 28:47.194
Four acres.

28:47.228 --> 28:49.029
Oh, if you have time,

28:49.063 --> 28:51.165
we have all these
Southwest points

28:51.198 --> 28:52.933
if you need help
with the flights.

28:52.967 --> 28:54.368
- We don't have that many.
- Oh, shh.

28:54.401 --> 28:56.804
Oh, yeah, um,

28:56.837 --> 28:59.273
Doug's really busy with work
these days, so...

28:59.940 --> 29:02.076
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, super busy.

29:02.109 --> 29:05.547
There's a lot of manuscripts
that need to get edited, so...

29:05.580 --> 29:08.415
Oh, well, he still gets
vacation days, doesn't he?

29:08.449 --> 29:11.919
And if you come in December,
you get to see all the lights.

29:11.952 --> 29:13.354
Well, I mean, we could, uh...
we could...

29:13.387 --> 29:15.155
we could check our calendars.

29:16.924 --> 29:19.360
Sweetie, can you show me
where the food is?

29:19.393 --> 29:20.461
Now?

29:23.197 --> 29:24.832
What are
you doing over there?

29:24.865 --> 29:26.166
Well, I thought
that was the plan,

29:26.200 --> 29:28.102
the two of us
still together.

29:28.135 --> 29:29.837
You are literally making
vacation plans

29:29.870 --> 29:31.272
with my grandparents.

29:31.305 --> 29:34.308
I'm just trying to
put on a good show.

29:34.341 --> 29:36.210
This is my life.

29:36.243 --> 29:38.012
These are my people.

29:38.045 --> 29:39.813
You don't have to deal with
them after this weekend,

29:39.847 --> 29:40.914
I do.

29:44.084 --> 29:46.420
You're right.

29:46.453 --> 29:48.355
I'm sorry. Okay?

29:50.592 --> 29:54.194
Maybe we should...
take a little space.

29:55.863 --> 29:57.931
Yeah, maybe.

29:57.965 --> 30:00.568
Avoid other people.

30:00.602 --> 30:01.869
Keep a low profile.

30:04.238 --> 30:06.907
Yeah, I think that
would really help.

30:10.377 --> 30:14.081
Hello, everyone,
and welcome to the first and only...

30:14.114 --> 30:19.320
Paul Bunyan Day!

30:19.353 --> 30:22.624
Team Babe!

30:22.657 --> 30:26.360
Team Lumberjack!

30:26.393 --> 30:28.495
All right, you each have
maps of the campgrounds.

30:28.530 --> 30:31.131
You're supposed to
make your way across camp,

30:31.165 --> 30:33.467
and find the first of
11 golden axes

30:33.500 --> 30:35.603
located next to
the blue star.

30:35.637 --> 30:37.905
As soon as the flare gun
goes off,

30:37.938 --> 30:42.109
each team must consume
two cases of Nati Light.

30:42.142 --> 30:44.411
And make your way down river
to the Ferris wheel.

30:44.445 --> 30:47.481
Whoever gets there first,
and kills the pony keg,

30:47.515 --> 30:50.250
wins the golden axe.

30:50.284 --> 30:52.386
Oh, man,
we gotta kill a pony?

30:52.419 --> 30:55.089
- N...
- Okay, does everyone understand the rules?

30:55.122 --> 30:56.890
- No!
- Okay!

30:56.924 --> 30:58.058
And we're off!

30:58.092 --> 30:59.527
Let's go!

30:59.561 --> 31:00.628
Let's go.

31:03.598 --> 31:05.299
You guys,
this is so sweet.

31:05.332 --> 31:07.669
Wait, which team
are you guys on?

31:07.702 --> 31:08.936
Oh, uh, we're...
we're not playing,

31:08.969 --> 31:10.538
we're... we're the refs.

31:10.572 --> 31:12.507
- No.
- Forget that. You guys are playin'.

31:12.540 --> 31:15.209
We can't play and host.

31:15.242 --> 31:17.978
Yeah, I mean, we're the only ones
that know where the golden axes are,

31:18.011 --> 31:20.948
I mean, and somebody's
gotta stay sober.

31:20.981 --> 31:23.183
Sober, schmober, come on,
you have to do it for me.

31:23.217 --> 31:24.686
For her. Look.

31:24.719 --> 31:26.253
My wedding.

31:26.286 --> 31:27.421
- For her.
- Okay.

31:27.454 --> 31:28.956
- I guess.
- Yes! Okay.

31:28.989 --> 31:30.658
Doug's on my team.
Doug's on my team.

31:30.692 --> 31:34.461
Ah, buddy, we're gonna burn
this whole forest down.

31:34.495 --> 31:37.699
Uh, we... No,
we're gonna win together.

31:37.732 --> 31:40.167
- I get stuck with Lori.
- Oh, come on.

31:40.200 --> 31:42.670
I can hold my liquor much
better than Doug over there.

31:42.704 --> 31:44.572
Oh, bullshit, you can.

31:44.606 --> 31:46.940
Says the guy who got drunk
off three kombuchas?

31:46.974 --> 31:49.677
- Ooh...
- Well, at least I didn't get blackout drunk on Jager bombs

31:49.711 --> 31:51.378
and make out with
my anthropology TA.

31:51.412 --> 31:52.647
Ooh...

31:52.680 --> 31:54.248
Whoa.

31:54.281 --> 31:56.250
- Oof.
- Beer me!

31:56.283 --> 31:58.218
Whoo!

31:58.252 --> 32:00.287
Oh, yeah.

32:00.320 --> 32:01.955
Let's go, Lori,
come on, Lori, come on, Lori,

32:01.989 --> 32:03.457
let's go, let's go, let's go.

32:03.490 --> 32:05.159
Go! Go! Go! Go!

32:08.195 --> 32:09.463
That's my sister!

32:11.566 --> 32:14.234
To the boats!

32:23.076 --> 32:26.980
So, this is
an American wedding.

32:27.014 --> 32:29.283
Uh, yeah, yeah,
pretty much.

32:29.316 --> 32:31.151
The first golden axe is ours!

32:31.185 --> 32:32.319
- Let's go!
- Whoo!

32:32.352 --> 32:34.321
To the Ferris wheel!

32:38.192 --> 32:40.027
Oh, no. We lost.

32:40.060 --> 32:42.429
Oh, don't worry, man.
We're gonna catch up later.

32:42.463 --> 32:44.732
Exactly. Everyone,
huddle up.

32:44.766 --> 32:47.034
Come on, bring it in.

32:47.067 --> 32:49.403
Operation Tortoise
is in full effect.

32:49.436 --> 32:51.104
What's Operation Tortoise?

32:51.138 --> 32:52.707
Oh, we tossed
the first challenge.

32:52.740 --> 32:54.576
It's a volume game.

32:54.609 --> 32:57.277
We let 'em get shitcanned,
then we crush 'em later.

32:57.311 --> 32:59.413
Or whatever.
Let's get incredibly stoned.

32:59.446 --> 33:01.381
Mm-hm.
Weed hamantaschen, Doug?

33:01.415 --> 33:04.318
Oh, no, I...
I gotta stay sharp.

33:04.351 --> 33:06.353
All right, bring it in.
Bring it in.

33:06.386 --> 33:08.388
All right,
Team Lumberjack on three.

33:08.422 --> 33:11.325
- One, two, three...
- Team Lumberjack!

33:12.560 --> 33:15.262
Mm. These Jews are
really on to something.

33:15.295 --> 33:17.464
These are gluten free,
right?

33:17.498 --> 33:20.467
Okay, for our second
golden axe,

33:20.501 --> 33:23.170
- you have to build a...
- Build a machine!

33:23.203 --> 33:26.808
A Rube Goldberg machine
out of which you must

33:26.841 --> 33:29.777
successfully pour
a shot of tequila.

33:29.811 --> 33:30.812
One, two, three, go.

33:30.845 --> 33:32.714
Go. Go.

33:32.747 --> 33:34.816
Wait, what? How?

33:34.849 --> 33:37.150
- Shove it in here.
- This here.

33:37.184 --> 33:39.654
- Okay, shove as many...
- Oh, but this is the same!

33:39.687 --> 33:42.524
Before we rush in,
let's everyone take a minute,

33:42.557 --> 33:45.225
and just regard
the materials.

33:48.095 --> 33:49.564
Figure it out!

33:49.597 --> 33:53.433
Don't rush, we'll see it
when we see it.

33:53.467 --> 33:55.068
Ooh, wait, wait.

33:55.102 --> 33:56.436
- Got it.
- This is too big.

33:56.470 --> 33:58.238
Hold on. No, guys,
this one. Look.

33:58.272 --> 34:00.742
- Yeah.
- Wait. No.

34:00.775 --> 34:02.209
- Do you see it?
- I see it.

34:02.242 --> 34:03.845
I see it, we see it.
Uh, so, Roya, yeah,

34:03.878 --> 34:05.412
I think you know this already,
but start with the 4x4s.

34:05.445 --> 34:07.214
Those are gonna be
the pillars.

34:07.247 --> 34:09.081
Uh, Dominic,
I want you to take the PVC piping

34:09.116 --> 34:10.518
and turn it into
a bit of a slalom.

34:10.552 --> 34:13.353
Here. How about that?
Does that thing fit?

34:13.387 --> 34:17.090
Uh, Jayson, I want you to start
on the smaller piece of wood,

34:17.123 --> 34:18.458
make a groove.

34:21.395 --> 34:23.531
- Yes! Yes!
- Yeah!

34:23.565 --> 34:25.465
Oh, man.

34:25.498 --> 34:26.601
Done.

34:26.634 --> 34:29.101
No!

34:29.136 --> 34:30.737
Goddammit!

34:32.406 --> 34:33.608
Would you do the honors?

34:53.293 --> 34:56.463
And we are tied

34:56.496 --> 34:59.634
with nine games to go.

34:59.667 --> 35:02.369
Wait. Nine?

35:02.402 --> 35:05.405
Camp Arrowhead!

35:05.439 --> 35:07.374
Ka-kaw.

35:07.407 --> 35:10.444
Oh, come on, people.

35:10.477 --> 35:15.248
I said, Camp Arrowhead!

35:15.282 --> 35:18.653
Ka-kaw!

35:18.686 --> 35:22.690
Hey, it looks like somebody
needs a little water.

35:22.724 --> 35:23.925
Ka-kaw!

35:23.958 --> 35:25.560
That's a...
That's a fair point,

35:25.593 --> 35:28.428
but I still think that
you ought to pace yourself.

35:28.462 --> 35:30.364
Why, 'cause you're afraid
I'm gonna...

35:30.397 --> 35:31.899
- kick your ass?
- Okay, no.

35:31.933 --> 35:33.400
You sure?

35:33.433 --> 35:34.769
'Cause I think
you're afraid.

35:34.802 --> 35:38.271
That I'ma whup your ass
and feed...

35:38.305 --> 35:40.240
your carcass to the wolves.

35:40.273 --> 35:41.909
What... What wolves?

35:41.943 --> 35:44.812
Would you...
Give it a rest!

35:44.846 --> 35:45.913
Okay?

35:47.682 --> 35:50.283
Give me
the fuckin' bottle.

36:21.481 --> 36:22.750
What's up!

36:28.589 --> 36:29.691
Yes!

36:43.037 --> 36:44.739
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

36:44.772 --> 36:48.576
Red Rover, Red Rover,
send Beatrice over!

36:55.917 --> 36:59.554
Red Rover, Red Rover,
let Jayson come over!

37:00.555 --> 37:01.789
All right,
all right.

37:06.928 --> 37:09.396
Oh, goddamn!

37:14.569 --> 37:16.738
Whoo!
Yeah! Yeah!

37:16.771 --> 37:20.307
Well, dang, um,
can't believe this,

37:20.340 --> 37:21.642
but we are out of challenges,

37:21.676 --> 37:23.410
and I don't think we can
declare a winner.

37:23.443 --> 37:25.278
What?
Wait, wait, wait...

37:25.312 --> 37:28.281
Well, I mean, look,
each team has five axes,

37:28.315 --> 37:29.382
and after
the dizzy bat debacle...

37:29.416 --> 37:30.450
I'm sorry, Allison.

37:30.484 --> 37:32.486
What happened to Allison?

37:32.520 --> 37:34.555
So, what are we gonna do
for a tie-breaker?

37:35.690 --> 37:37.491
We don't have
a tie-breaker.

37:37.525 --> 37:39.326
Well, you better
come up with one,

37:39.359 --> 37:40.494
or I will.

37:42.897 --> 37:45.465
Yeah, I'd just like to say
that I strongly object to this.

37:45.499 --> 37:47.400
- This is your fault.
- How is this our fault?

37:47.434 --> 37:48.770
First one to hit
the water loses,

37:48.803 --> 37:50.437
winner takes the Bunyan.

37:50.470 --> 37:53.406
Get her.
Get her!

37:53.440 --> 37:54.942
Stop pitty-patting
up there.

37:54.976 --> 37:56.511
Come on, you gotta try
harder than that.

37:56.544 --> 37:58.445
No, I'm not gonna
just hit her.

37:58.478 --> 38:00.815
- I give you permission to hit her.
- Thanks, Bea.

38:00.848 --> 38:02.884
Yeah, don't take it easy on
her just 'cause you love her.

38:02.917 --> 38:04.719
Pretend you guys
are strangers.

38:04.752 --> 38:06.721
Yeah, pretend you
fuckin' hate each other.

38:06.754 --> 38:08.689
- Fuck him up!
- Seriously?

38:15.663 --> 38:16.864
Babe Team wins!

38:21.969 --> 38:23.905
You really let me down
up there, man.

38:25.773 --> 38:27.508
Yeah, I'm over it.
Give me a kiss.

38:27.542 --> 38:28.709
- Mwah!
- Okay.

38:28.743 --> 38:29.811
All right.

38:50.765 --> 38:52.399
I know it's not
a trophy.

38:52.432 --> 38:54.334
Oh, hell, yeah.

38:56.637 --> 38:59.006
But just let me hold...
let me hold the Bunyan.

38:59.040 --> 39:00.775
- No, he's mine.
- Come on. Come on.

39:04.579 --> 39:05.913
Oh, look.

39:05.947 --> 39:08.583
It's the waterfall.

39:08.616 --> 39:11.986
Oh, shit.

39:12.019 --> 39:16.691
Oh, Wendy Chen got caught making
out with a CIT there. Remember?

39:16.724 --> 39:19.861
Uh, she... No, she got
kicked out of camp, didn't she?

39:19.894 --> 39:23.531
Yeah. I heard she died.

39:23.564 --> 39:24.932
Really?

39:24.966 --> 39:27.400
I don't know. Maybe.

39:27.434 --> 39:28.836
We all do, eventually.

39:31.205 --> 39:33.440
Well, Wendy was a dumb-dumb.

39:33.473 --> 39:35.509
Everyone knows,

39:35.543 --> 39:37.477
if you want to fool around,
you go to the tree house.

39:37.511 --> 39:39.412
Go to the tree house!

39:39.446 --> 39:41.515
Whenever you're sad
and missing home...

39:41.549 --> 39:44.118
...go to the tree house,
you won't be alone.

39:47.622 --> 39:50.024
So, where do you live
in San Francisco?

39:50.057 --> 39:52.693
- Do you know the city?
- Nope.

39:52.727 --> 39:55.495
All right, um, well,

39:55.529 --> 39:58.566
I just bought a little house
in Rockridge.

39:58.599 --> 40:00.902
Describe it to me.

40:00.935 --> 40:03.604
It's blue.

40:03.638 --> 40:07.508
Um... there's
an herb garden out back.

40:07.541 --> 40:11.478
Nothing's grown yet,
but... fingers crossed.

40:13.047 --> 40:15.950
I don't know.
It's a house.

40:15.983 --> 40:17.685
And it's mine.

40:17.718 --> 40:19.987
And I love it.

40:20.021 --> 40:23.157
That sounds...

40:23.190 --> 40:24.992
amazing.

40:25.026 --> 40:27.895
Like...
Like really amazing.

40:27.929 --> 40:29.764
I want that.

40:29.797 --> 40:32.667
Would you like to pay
my mortgage, also?

40:33.801 --> 40:35.468
- Okay.
- Yeah?

40:35.503 --> 40:36.570
Yeah.

40:40.841 --> 40:42.543
I don't have no money
right now...

40:42.576 --> 40:43.878
- Oh.
- But I'm... But I'm good for it,

40:43.911 --> 40:45.713
I'm good for it.
Wait. Look.

40:47.815 --> 40:52.987
Here. I... O... U.

40:57.258 --> 40:58.859
I hope I can cash this.

41:03.164 --> 41:05.099
I'm starving.

41:05.132 --> 41:06.901
Is there any food
in this place?

41:06.934 --> 41:10.671
Baby, we've literally
only eaten here.

41:10.705 --> 41:12.907
By the way, I was supposed to
split a sundae with Doug.

41:12.940 --> 41:14.008
Where is he?

41:31.892 --> 41:33.828
Water's getting
a little cold.

41:36.964 --> 41:40.134
We could go get in
the Jacuzzi.

41:42.203 --> 41:43.504
No.

41:44.638 --> 41:46.273
I mean, we could
just head back.

41:49.810 --> 41:52.179
I don't want to
head back.

41:52.213 --> 41:53.714
- No?
- Mm-mm.

41:55.816 --> 41:56.951
Neither do I.

42:23.778 --> 42:26.047
Mm, mm, mm, mm.

42:26.080 --> 42:27.715
You want a bite of this,
don't you?

42:27.748 --> 42:29.617
- But just, like, a little bit.
- A little bit?

42:29.650 --> 42:31.152
- Mm-hm.
- Okay, how about this bite? I did it.

42:31.185 --> 42:34.255
- More than that.
- Perfectly. More than that?

42:34.288 --> 42:36.824
Okay, here's
a little bit more.

42:36.857 --> 42:38.159
- Okay, ready?
- Mm-hm.

42:41.228 --> 42:42.596
I know.

42:42.630 --> 42:43.831
I did that just for you.

42:46.167 --> 42:48.736
I did that just for you.

42:48.769 --> 42:50.204
- That's so good.
- Right?

42:55.242 --> 42:57.044
- You guys want a bite?
- Absolutely not.

42:57.078 --> 42:58.245
- I'm thinkin' I'm good.
- No, I'm good.

43:00.014 --> 43:01.282
Hi. Can I get
a shot of whiskey, please?

43:01.315 --> 43:03.050
Uh, we have
a cocktail menu.

43:03.084 --> 43:05.953
Oh, great. Can I get
a shot of whiskey, please?

43:05.986 --> 43:07.054
Sure.

43:13.227 --> 43:14.862
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

43:19.667 --> 43:21.202
Lori Anderson.

43:22.803 --> 43:24.638
Hey.

43:24.672 --> 43:27.641
Uh, so some of us
were gonna go into town.

43:27.675 --> 43:29.310
Oh, what's in town?

43:29.343 --> 43:31.846
Uh, just
a miniature horse farm.

43:33.214 --> 43:34.982
Isn't it dark out?

43:35.015 --> 43:36.684
Yeah.

43:36.717 --> 43:38.419
We'll probably just
go to some bars, then.

43:38.452 --> 43:40.354
Yeah, or you...
I don't know,

43:40.387 --> 43:42.223
we could just stay here.

43:42.256 --> 43:46.227
Uh, yeah. I can go see if
the guys want to...

43:46.260 --> 43:48.262
Or, you know,
just you and me.

43:51.966 --> 43:53.901
Okay.

43:53.934 --> 43:55.369
Okay.

44:04.712 --> 44:07.715
So, uh, I...

44:07.748 --> 44:10.184
I should probably
get to bed.

44:13.220 --> 44:14.421
Goodnight.

44:16.123 --> 44:17.224
'Night.

44:22.263 --> 44:24.198
Oh...

44:24.231 --> 44:27.935
Oh, no...

44:27.968 --> 44:31.205
Oh, no, this is no fun.

44:31.238 --> 44:32.673
Sad face.

44:35.943 --> 44:37.711
Let's play.

44:37.745 --> 44:40.247
Seriously?
Spin the bottle?

44:40.281 --> 44:41.749
- Yeah, come on.
- Oh, God.

44:41.782 --> 44:43.217
It's camp tradition.

44:43.250 --> 44:44.485
You gonna go against
tradition?

44:44.519 --> 44:45.719
Yeah, whatever.

44:45.753 --> 44:47.388
Okay.

44:49.056 --> 44:50.457
Lame.

44:50.491 --> 44:52.960
All right, you go.

44:52.993 --> 44:54.728
- I also suck at this.
- Do it again.

44:55.796 --> 44:56.864
Oh!

45:04.805 --> 45:06.974
Oh, no.

45:07.007 --> 45:08.842
Really?

45:08.876 --> 45:11.245
Okay.

45:23.857 --> 45:26.827
Oh...

45:26.860 --> 45:28.996
- Wait.
- I don't think I can...

45:29.029 --> 45:30.264
- What are you doing?
- Do this.

45:30.297 --> 45:32.399
Mm-mm.
This is not right.

45:32.433 --> 45:33.934
Wait,
where are you going?

45:33.968 --> 45:35.502
I just gonna take
a little walk.

45:35.537 --> 45:37.037
- Where...
- I gotta go.

45:37.071 --> 45:39.940
Wait, Lor... Lor...
Come on, Lori.

46:06.033 --> 46:07.268
Hey, what...

46:09.604 --> 46:12.006
Are you bleeding?

46:12.039 --> 46:13.107
I saw you.

46:15.909 --> 46:18.279
On the bridge,
I saw you.

46:18.312 --> 46:20.281
What...
What did you see?

46:22.517 --> 46:24.351
She had her hand on
your arm.

46:26.487 --> 46:27.555
I saw.

46:31.325 --> 46:32.960
Okay, just, um...

46:32.993 --> 46:34.562
- You fuck her?
- What?

46:37.498 --> 46:39.366
No.

46:39.400 --> 46:41.001
So nothing happened.

46:48.976 --> 46:50.144
We, um...

46:56.383 --> 46:59.219
We... We fooled around
a little bit.

47:02.456 --> 47:04.892
And... I don't know
what you want from me.

47:08.495 --> 47:10.230
That...

47:10.264 --> 47:11.865
That is so mean.

47:14.602 --> 47:16.003
It's just so mean.

47:17.505 --> 47:18.939
I'm sorry.

47:23.077 --> 47:25.245
I... I am... I am...

47:25.279 --> 47:27.948
I am so fucking sorry.

47:30.585 --> 47:32.186
I'm so sorry.

48:10.525 --> 48:12.326
What was that?

48:12.359 --> 48:13.460
Nothing.

48:15.630 --> 48:18.566
I said marry me, and...
and you threw up.

48:18.600 --> 48:20.100
That didn't seem like
nothing.

48:20.134 --> 48:21.435
Can we please just
go home, Doug?

48:21.468 --> 48:22.570
I don't feel good.

48:26.006 --> 48:27.542
Fuck off.

48:27.575 --> 48:30.077
Goddammit, do you...
do you hate the idea that much?

48:30.110 --> 48:31.646
No, I never said that!

48:31.679 --> 48:35.182
Okay, so Lori Anderson,
will you marry me?

48:37.317 --> 48:40.421
Wow. Okay, uh, yeah,
fuck this, I'm done.

48:44.491 --> 48:46.528
- With us?
- Yeah.

48:55.603 --> 48:57.971
Doug.

48:58.005 --> 49:00.307
Yeah?

49:00.340 --> 49:01.509
Ask me again.

49:05.412 --> 49:07.448
You're engaged!

49:07.481 --> 49:09.082
Why didn't you tell me?

49:09.116 --> 49:10.652
Oh, well, you know,
we didn't want to

49:10.685 --> 49:12.386
steal your thunder
over the weekend.

49:12.419 --> 49:14.221
You know, I knew it.

49:14.254 --> 49:16.056
I... I knew something weird
was going on with you guys.

49:16.089 --> 49:19.426
Yeah, she was like, "Hey,
something's going on with them."

49:19.460 --> 49:21.295
Uh, well, we wanted to
keep it a secret,

49:21.328 --> 49:23.665
but, yeah,
we're gettin' married.

49:25.667 --> 49:29.336
What is wrong?
What is happening?

49:29.369 --> 49:32.072
These two idiots
are engaged.

49:32.105 --> 49:34.374
Really? Oh, my God!

49:34.408 --> 49:35.643
- Ow.
- Oh, my God.

49:35.677 --> 49:37.645
- Hey.
- Oh, honey.

49:37.679 --> 49:41.516
You have no idea how long I
have waited to hear this news.

49:41.549 --> 49:46.153
- Jojo, Lydia...
- No. Hey. Look at me.

49:46.186 --> 49:48.388
This weekend is not
really about us, right?

49:48.422 --> 49:51.325
So we just want to keep it
private for a little bit. Okay?

49:56.698 --> 49:58.131
My lips are sealed.

50:00.400 --> 50:01.636
Okay?

50:03.270 --> 50:05.773
You guys have made me
so happy.

50:05.807 --> 50:07.107
Okay.

50:10.110 --> 50:12.346
You make a nice groom.

50:12.379 --> 50:16.784
Oh, well, uh...
King of the Ushers, actually.

50:16.818 --> 50:18.520
It's not
a real position.

50:24.592 --> 50:27.361
Doug, help me pick
a yarmulke.

50:27.394 --> 50:31.098
White. Blue.

50:31.131 --> 50:33.500
White with blue.

50:33.535 --> 50:35.637
Bedazzled.

50:35.670 --> 50:38.506
Well, I mean,
they all look pretty nice.

50:38.540 --> 50:40.307
Let me show you again.

50:40.340 --> 50:42.142
- White.
- Mm-hm.

50:42.175 --> 50:46.113
Blue.
White with blue.

50:46.146 --> 50:47.281
Bedazzled.

50:50.317 --> 50:51.318
- Okay, all right.
- Uh...

50:51.351 --> 50:52.754
Other order.

50:54.589 --> 50:58.358
Maybe we can
alter my wedding dress.

50:58.392 --> 51:00.260
Oh, it's a traditional
silhouette.

51:00.294 --> 51:01.863
Right.
Not really your thing.

51:01.896 --> 51:03.463
Please wear Mom's
wedding dress.

51:03.497 --> 51:06.099
Oh, no, wait, stop.
That's the haunted one.

51:07.802 --> 51:10.404
Did your father
at least RSVP?

51:10.437 --> 51:13.340
Yes. He called to say
congratulations.

51:13.373 --> 51:15.242
He says he wishes
he could be here.

51:15.275 --> 51:17.311
And he said he'd buy the most
expensive thing on the registry,

51:17.344 --> 51:18.813
so here's hoping for
a jet ski.

51:18.846 --> 51:20.882
Could I at least tell
Grandma and Grandpa?

51:20.915 --> 51:22.584
About the jet ski?

51:22.617 --> 51:24.484
Yeah, you think they'd be
down for a trip?

51:24.519 --> 51:26.353
- Mm-hm.
- Uh, no, Mom,

51:26.386 --> 51:27.689
I told you,
not until after the wedding.

51:27.722 --> 51:30.123
Let me just text
my book club.

51:30.157 --> 51:31.559
They'll be so excited.

51:31.593 --> 51:33.393
Did you text your book club
when I got engaged?

51:33.427 --> 51:37.765
It's just that Doug is...
is like part of the family.

51:37.799 --> 51:40.233
It's different.

51:40.267 --> 51:42.570
Where is that lady?
I'm supposed to start my "shitsu."

51:43.905 --> 51:46.741
Mom, you mean shia...

51:46.774 --> 51:48.910
- Nope. "Shitsu."
- Yep.

51:48.943 --> 51:50.143
Yep.

51:50.177 --> 51:52.680
Hey, Doug.

51:54.448 --> 51:55.650
I'm stupid.

51:55.683 --> 51:57.184
No, no, it was...
it was very nice.

51:57.217 --> 51:59.252
Thank you. Thank you.

51:59.286 --> 52:02.557
So, uh, when are you guys
thinkin'?

52:02.590 --> 52:04.257
Of... Of gettin' married,
when are you guys thinkin'?

52:04.291 --> 52:05.860
Oh, oh, yeah.

52:05.893 --> 52:07.729
Oh, man, we...
we hadn't really thought about it yet.

52:07.762 --> 52:10.364
We're thinkin' maybe...

52:10.397 --> 52:12.700
uh... next June?

52:12.734 --> 52:14.569
June sucks, Doug.

52:14.602 --> 52:16.403
Ah, just... just
figure it out ASAP.

52:16.436 --> 52:18.405
You know, my ex and I were
engaged for three years

52:18.438 --> 52:19.941
before we set a date,
and...

52:19.974 --> 52:21.576
probably wasn't a good sign.

52:23.377 --> 52:26.380
But you and Lori,
you guys are totally different.

52:26.413 --> 52:27.782
You guys are in it
for the long haul.

52:27.815 --> 52:29.182
Yeah.

52:32.419 --> 52:34.689
We broke up on Wednesday,
actually.

52:37.859 --> 52:40.293
Oh...

52:40.327 --> 52:43.463
Uh, I'm sorry,
but... but...

52:43.497 --> 52:46.366
So when did you
get engaged?

52:46.400 --> 52:47.702
Uh, last night.

52:49.436 --> 52:54.207
Oh... Uh... so that first day
in the lobby,

52:54.241 --> 52:55.943
and then Paul Bunyan Day,
you guys were...

52:55.977 --> 52:58.813
Yeah, we were pretending
to still be together.

52:58.846 --> 53:00.948
- Oh!
- You know, for Bea.

53:00.982 --> 53:02.817
Yeah, yeah.
I'm just...

53:02.850 --> 53:04.819
I'm so sorry you guys,
you know, broke up.

53:04.852 --> 53:06.219
Oh, no, but we're fine.

53:06.253 --> 53:07.755
- Now.
- Oh, yeah, obviously now.

53:07.789 --> 53:10.390
You know, I mean,
I totally get why you guys

53:10.424 --> 53:13.460
would pretend and then
not pretend with the...

53:13.493 --> 53:15.495
the, uh, you know,
with the engagement thing.

53:15.530 --> 53:16.798
- Yeah.
- Awesome.

53:16.831 --> 53:18.666
Yeah.
Thanks again for these.

53:18.700 --> 53:19.901
Yeah, yeah.

53:31.512 --> 53:33.648
Very handsome.

53:33.681 --> 53:34.749
Thank you.

53:37.652 --> 53:38.720
Can I...

53:57.705 --> 53:58.806
Perfect.

54:01.843 --> 54:04.912
So, where's
the honeymoon, Hawaii? Paris?

54:04.946 --> 54:07.414
Oh, no, no, uh, Niagara Falls.

54:07.447 --> 54:09.650
It's... It's where my folks
went on their honeymoon.

54:09.684 --> 54:11.519
Yeah, we really
wanted to honor them.

54:11.552 --> 54:13.755
And then you'll
move in together?

54:13.788 --> 54:15.990
No, we already live together.
Jayson has a place in the Mission.

54:16.023 --> 54:18.492
Yeah, and, uh,
we're looking for something bigger,

54:18.526 --> 54:21.629
though, with a backyard
and a studio for Bea.

54:22.730 --> 54:24.899
For her scrunchies.

54:24.932 --> 54:26.834
- Yep.
- Uh-huh.

54:26.868 --> 54:29.302
Oh, I love mine, dear.

54:30.772 --> 54:32.707
You should have made
one of these for me, honey,

54:32.740 --> 54:33.975
I can be a bad bitch.

54:35.342 --> 54:36.811
Next time, Pop-Pop.

54:36.844 --> 54:39.547
I'll hold you to that.

54:39.580 --> 54:41.783
Uh, you know, Lori and I were
thinking about getting a house.

54:41.816 --> 54:43.584
We were?

54:43.618 --> 54:45.452
Oh, that's... it's...

54:45.485 --> 54:46.687
You know, I actually know
a great real estate agent.

54:46.721 --> 54:48.689
- Oh, my God.
- In Portland.

54:48.723 --> 54:50.357
- Yeah.
- You guys should look in that neighborhood

54:50.390 --> 54:53.528
that you showed me with
all the Craftsman houses.

54:53.561 --> 54:56.564
Oh, I like our apartment.

54:56.597 --> 55:00.101
Oh, I mean, sure, but, I mean,
if you want to build up...

55:00.134 --> 55:02.402
- you know, equity, you should...
- Yeah, but, you know,

55:02.435 --> 55:06.707
our rent is cheap, and, uh,
it's close to my work.

55:06.741 --> 55:08.910
Right, I mean, but you're also
not gonna work there forever.

55:08.943 --> 55:11.444
- I might.
- So...

55:11.478 --> 55:12.814
Okay.

55:13.581 --> 55:14.649
Cool.

55:40.074 --> 55:41.742
I'm just worried

55:41.776 --> 55:43.678
you're gonna make
the same mistake I did.

55:43.711 --> 55:45.445
Oh,
so we were mistakes?

55:45.478 --> 55:48.115
No. I married a man
I didn't love.

55:48.149 --> 55:49.482
But I love Jayson.

55:49.517 --> 55:51.619
I'm marrying
my soul mate.

55:51.652 --> 55:53.453
Why can't you be
happy for me?

55:53.486 --> 55:56.691
- Hey.
- Lori, please tell your sister I'm just...

55:56.724 --> 55:58.125
We're worried about her.

55:58.159 --> 56:00.695
Oh, Lori, please tell Mom
she's being a bitch.

56:01.863 --> 56:03.998
Okay, I tried.
Really, I tried.

56:04.031 --> 56:05.566
Great. Try harder.

56:07.869 --> 56:10.972
Seriously. She thinks
I am some, like, idiot baby

56:11.005 --> 56:12.773
who can't
take care of herself.

56:12.807 --> 56:15.109
We just think that
you're a little impulsive.

56:17.078 --> 56:20.615
I mean, you know,
you're Bea, you're fun.

56:20.648 --> 56:22.984
You don't think about
consequences, you...

56:23.017 --> 56:24.919
you dropped out of college
to go surfing.

56:24.952 --> 56:27.788
I get engaged to a man
I've known for four weeks.

56:27.822 --> 56:30.024
Yes, exactly.
That...

56:30.825 --> 56:32.827
Hey, baby.
Your Mom's in there cryin'

56:32.860 --> 56:34.762
and snarfin' down
a whole pie.

56:37.031 --> 56:39.700
What's goin...
What's goin' on?

56:41.035 --> 56:42.770
Well, Lori doesn't think
I should marry you.

56:42.803 --> 56:44.939
I did not say that.

56:44.972 --> 56:46.741
God, you may as well have.

56:46.774 --> 56:47.909
I don't think I'd be taking
relationship advice

56:47.942 --> 56:49.577
from your sister.

56:49.610 --> 56:51.746
I'm sorry. What's that
supposed to mean?

56:51.779 --> 56:52.880
Jayson,
now is not the time.

56:52.914 --> 56:54.215
Wait, what?

56:58.519 --> 56:59.787
Honey, they...

56:59.820 --> 57:01.856
they broke up
three days ago.

57:06.794 --> 57:07.895
That true?

57:11.498 --> 57:15.636
That is... Yes,
that's... that's true.

57:15.670 --> 57:17.838
I'm sorry, we just...

57:17.872 --> 57:19.240
we thought it'd be
too hard to tell you,

57:19.273 --> 57:21.075
and then I thought
maybe it was better

57:21.108 --> 57:22.643
we just pretend
for the weekend.

57:22.677 --> 57:26.013
Oh, my G... So...

57:26.047 --> 57:27.581
are you getting married
or are you breaking up?

57:27.615 --> 57:29.717
No, no, no,
we're getting married.

57:29.750 --> 57:31.652
We... We worked
everything out.

57:35.056 --> 57:36.123
Doug...

57:39.560 --> 57:41.929
- We're fine.
- They're fine.

57:41.963 --> 57:45.633
- They're fine.
- I can't believe this.

57:45.666 --> 57:46.968
- Oh, my God.
- Honey...

57:49.804 --> 57:50.871
Bea...

58:31.946 --> 58:33.180
Lori...

58:37.318 --> 58:39.887
Why didn't you answer me?

58:39.920 --> 58:42.223
What?

58:42.256 --> 58:44.825
When I asked you to marry me.

58:46.961 --> 58:48.596
Why didn't you answer?

58:50.898 --> 58:53.667
I don't...

58:53.701 --> 58:55.970
I don't know.

58:56.003 --> 58:57.238
Okay.

59:00.141 --> 59:02.977
I think you do, but... okay.

59:03.010 --> 59:06.580
Maybe because
I thought we were good.

59:06.614 --> 59:09.617
I thought things were fine
the way they were.

59:09.650 --> 59:11.285
Fine.

59:11.318 --> 59:14.688
I'm in love with you.

59:14.722 --> 59:17.291
Oh, my God.
I am in love with you too.

59:17.324 --> 59:18.926
I didn't say I was
in love with you.

59:18.959 --> 59:21.862
I'm saying that
I thought we were good.

59:21.896 --> 59:23.697
I liked us.

59:23.731 --> 59:26.667
I didn't want to fuck that up
by getting married.

59:26.700 --> 59:29.370
But we are getting married.

59:29.403 --> 59:31.338
We're engaged to be married.

59:31.372 --> 59:33.908
Yes, of course, we are.
I just...

59:36.010 --> 59:38.612
Things are different now.

59:38.646 --> 59:42.850
Why are things
suddenly different?

59:42.883 --> 59:45.986
I don't know.
They just are.

59:46.020 --> 59:49.056
So you're saying you definitely
want to get married to me?

59:49.090 --> 59:50.825
That's what you're saying?

59:50.858 --> 59:54.061
- Yes, I do.
- Okay. When?

59:57.998 --> 01:00:01.035
I'm sorry. Are you really asking
me to set a date right now?

01:00:01.068 --> 01:00:04.105
Mm-hmm. Like, October.

01:00:04.138 --> 01:00:07.341
January, June.

01:00:07.374 --> 01:00:09.977
- June.
- What kind of cake?

01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:12.847
Chocolate.

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:15.082
All right, should we invite
everyone we know,

01:00:15.116 --> 01:00:17.384
or just our close friends,

01:00:17.418 --> 01:00:21.055
Ah, what should our vows be?

01:00:21.088 --> 01:00:23.691
- What do you want your dress to look like?
- I don't know.

01:00:23.724 --> 01:00:24.859
I told you, I don't
care about this stuff.

01:00:24.892 --> 01:00:26.694
Right, you don't
care about it,

01:00:26.727 --> 01:00:28.796
because you don't actually
want to get married.

01:00:28.829 --> 01:00:31.332
No. I don't care about it,

01:00:31.365 --> 01:00:34.101
because I actually like
our life.

01:00:34.135 --> 01:00:36.437
It's not real.

01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:38.772
It's a practice life.

01:00:38.806 --> 01:00:40.941
We're just playing house.

01:00:40.975 --> 01:00:42.276
We have both of our names
on the lease,

01:00:42.309 --> 01:00:44.078
but that's where it stops
for you.

01:00:46.847 --> 01:00:48.949
I want to spend my life
with you.

01:00:51.452 --> 01:00:53.120
My whole entire life.

01:00:55.756 --> 01:00:57.224
I wanna... I wanna...

01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:01.061
I wanna get a house together.

01:01:01.095 --> 01:01:02.997
I wanna have kids together.

01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:06.066
I want us to get old

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:08.169
and die together.

01:01:11.906 --> 01:01:13.807
Isn't that what you want?

01:01:41.168 --> 01:01:42.269
No.

01:01:46.807 --> 01:01:47.942
No?

01:01:56.116 --> 01:01:57.519
- Oh, man.
- Oh, no.

01:02:02.289 --> 01:02:05.459
No, that's... That...
That is a third of my life.

01:02:06.927 --> 01:02:09.263
That's ten years...

01:02:09.296 --> 01:02:12.266
wasted with you.

01:02:14.034 --> 01:02:15.402
Wait.

01:02:15.436 --> 01:02:17.972
I was saying I was happy.

01:02:28.949 --> 01:02:30.818
- Dougie!
- Not now, man.

01:05:36.503 --> 01:05:39.373
- Bea!
- She's not here.

01:05:39.406 --> 01:05:41.008
What?

01:05:43.410 --> 01:05:45.580
Bea! Okay, where is she?

01:05:45.613 --> 01:05:46.947
I have no idea.

01:05:48.148 --> 01:05:50.317
Seriously.

01:05:50.350 --> 01:05:52.419
She didn't come back
last night.

01:05:52.453 --> 01:05:56.089
I mean, I looked
for her for awhile,

01:05:56.123 --> 01:05:57.759
but I figured she'd eventually
come back to the room

01:05:57.792 --> 01:06:02.196
or to yours,
but she's gone.

01:06:02.229 --> 01:06:03.531
Isn't the ceremony in, like,
three or...

01:06:03.565 --> 01:06:05.399
Four hours. No shit.

01:06:09.704 --> 01:06:11.438
What if, like,
a mountain lion got her?

01:06:11.472 --> 01:06:14.007
Oh, I don't think there
are mountain lions here.

01:06:14.041 --> 01:06:16.043
Okay, fine. I don't know,
something else then.

01:06:16.076 --> 01:06:18.111
It's the woods.

01:06:18.145 --> 01:06:20.548
I mean, anything can happen in the woods.

01:06:25.352 --> 01:06:27.789
What's going on?

01:06:27.822 --> 01:06:31.759
Okay, so I've checked here,
here, and here.

01:06:31.793 --> 01:06:33.093
We'll check
the bocce ball court.

01:06:33.126 --> 01:06:34.596
And I could check the pool.

01:06:34.629 --> 01:06:36.531
And there's a section
of woods over here.

01:06:36.564 --> 01:06:39.299
Okay, great. And anyone who
finds her, just let me know.

01:06:39.333 --> 01:06:40.802
Okay, Doug and Lori,

01:06:40.835 --> 01:06:42.804
we'll start at the tennis courts

01:06:42.837 --> 01:06:44.572
- and fan out from there.
- Okay.

01:06:44.606 --> 01:06:47.709
Adelaide, I was hoping
you could do us a big favor

01:06:47.742 --> 01:06:50.545
and just head to the reception hall
and find Tia the wedding coordinator.

01:06:50.578 --> 01:06:52.547
I'm not going anywhere.

01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:55.683
Well, this is kind of an "all
hands on deck" situation.

01:06:55.717 --> 01:06:58.686
When Bea was 14 years old,

01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:02.624
she asked me if she could go
to horseback riding camp.

01:07:02.657 --> 01:07:05.560
Mind you,
she'd never ridden a horse.

01:07:05.593 --> 01:07:08.195
But she would not shut up
about it until I caved.

01:07:08.228 --> 01:07:11.465
So June came,
and we went to Eugene,

01:07:11.498 --> 01:07:13.768
and I dropped her off.

01:07:13.801 --> 01:07:18.338
Three days in, I get a call.
Bea's missing.

01:07:18.372 --> 01:07:21.141
I get back to Eugene.

01:07:21.174 --> 01:07:25.145
I call the police.
Lori, tell them where we found Bea.

01:07:26.413 --> 01:07:28.282
In a diner
eating a banana split.

01:07:28.315 --> 01:07:33.153
"I guess I don't like horses,"
she said,

01:07:33.186 --> 01:07:35.790
and that day, I learned...

01:07:35.823 --> 01:07:39.293
if Bea's running, she's done.

01:07:39.326 --> 01:07:42.564
And no one can do anything
about it.

01:07:42.597 --> 01:07:45.299
Not me...

01:07:45.332 --> 01:07:46.601
and especially not you.

01:07:50.772 --> 01:07:52.540
I'll start making calls.

01:07:56.176 --> 01:07:57.444
Excuse me.

01:07:59.446 --> 01:08:01.148
This wedding is happening.

01:08:03.183 --> 01:08:06.621
Whether you like it or not,
I'm marrying your daughter today.

01:08:08.590 --> 01:08:11.626
I know I'm not
what you pictured.

01:08:11.659 --> 01:08:15.429
I'm almost 40, divorced.

01:08:15.462 --> 01:08:20.233
I've got a kid who's way more
mature than I'll ever be.

01:08:20.267 --> 01:08:23.170
But I love Bea.

01:08:24.538 --> 01:08:27.508
And I know I can make her happy.

01:08:29.443 --> 01:08:32.379
And right now, she's out there
waiting for me to find her.

01:08:32.412 --> 01:08:34.147
To fight for her.

01:08:36.517 --> 01:08:41.756
And you know these scrunchies
you all laugh at?

01:08:41.788 --> 01:08:43.658
They're awesome.

01:08:43.691 --> 01:08:45.526
She wrote a
whole business plan.

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:47.361
She's got investors
I had nothing to do with.

01:08:47.394 --> 01:08:50.898
Did she tell you that Goop
wants to sell them?

01:08:50.932 --> 01:08:52.567
Yeah.

01:08:55.603 --> 01:08:59.506
So here's what's gonna happen.

01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:04.411
I'm gonna need you to go find
Tia, the wedding coordinator,

01:09:04.444 --> 01:09:08.215
and make sure that everything's
set for the ceremony this afternoon

01:09:08.247 --> 01:09:10.685
and then stay out of my way,

01:09:10.718 --> 01:09:12.419
'cause I'm gonna go get
your daughter back.

01:09:14.453 --> 01:09:16.256
Let's go to the tennis courts.

01:09:25.733 --> 01:09:27.367
We should split up.

01:09:27.401 --> 01:09:28.935
I'm gonna go
to the reception hall.

01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:30.738
Doug, you check the goats.

01:09:30.772 --> 01:09:32.874
Lori, you know, that waterfall
near the lake?

01:09:32.907 --> 01:09:35.977
Lori? What's up?

01:09:36.010 --> 01:09:38.712
"If you're feeling sad
or missing home"?

01:09:38.746 --> 01:09:40.747
I know where she is.

01:09:47.822 --> 01:09:49.288
She's not here.

01:09:49.322 --> 01:09:51.559
Well, did you look everywhere?

01:09:51.591 --> 01:09:54.261
It's 10 square feet.
I'm coming down.

01:09:54.294 --> 01:09:56.496
Shoot.
I really thought I had it.

01:09:56.531 --> 01:09:59.767
Is there something else...

01:09:59.801 --> 01:10:01.002
she mentioned while
we were here?

01:10:01.035 --> 01:10:02.469
Some other place maybe?

01:10:02.502 --> 01:10:05.272
If we just retrace our steps...

01:10:05.305 --> 01:10:07.240
Why would she have traced
our steps?

01:10:07.274 --> 01:10:10.243
Guys, it's her.
It's Bea.

01:10:10.277 --> 01:10:12.013
<i>I love you so much,
but I can't...</i>

01:10:12.046 --> 01:10:14.882
<i>I can't do it. I can't do it.
I'm so sorry.</i>

01:10:14.916 --> 01:10:17.518
I know where she is.

01:10:17.552 --> 01:10:19.687
- Okay, well, where is she?
- Please share.

01:10:19.721 --> 01:10:22.523
Jesus, he's fast.

01:10:28.896 --> 01:10:30.497
Why would she be here?

01:10:32.066 --> 01:10:33.534
Oh, thank God.

01:10:45.345 --> 01:10:47.247
Lake of the Ozarks, baby.

01:10:51.085 --> 01:10:52.820
But how?

01:10:52.854 --> 01:10:54.856
How do you know
I won't wreck this?

01:10:54.889 --> 01:10:55.957
'Cause I won't let
that happen.

01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:57.759
- My mom's right!
- No.

01:10:57.792 --> 01:10:59.761
I'm a flake, I get bored.

01:10:59.794 --> 01:11:01.829
I disappoint every person
in my life.

01:11:01.863 --> 01:11:04.599
- Bea...
- I can't get married.

01:11:04.632 --> 01:11:07.300
Yes, we can.

01:11:07.334 --> 01:11:09.503
So what if we wake up
one morning

01:11:09.537 --> 01:11:12.339
and realize we don't actually
like each other that much?

01:11:12.372 --> 01:11:14.341
That's never gonna happen.

01:11:14.374 --> 01:11:17.945
It already happened
to you once.

01:11:17.979 --> 01:11:19.747
- I can't.
- Wait.

01:11:19.781 --> 01:11:22.349
- I can't.
- We're different.

01:11:22.382 --> 01:11:23.684
- This is different.
- Just...

01:11:25.686 --> 01:11:27.655
Can you guys just tell everyone
it's cancelled?

01:11:31.559 --> 01:11:33.426
No.

01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:36.097
What do you mean, no?

01:11:36.130 --> 01:11:38.331
We're not going to let you
do this.

01:11:38.365 --> 01:11:40.535
You love each other.

01:11:40.568 --> 01:11:42.502
Well, I thought you guys
loved each other, too.

01:11:42.537 --> 01:11:44.371
We...

01:11:44.404 --> 01:11:45.773
We did.

01:11:47.474 --> 01:11:51.012
Really hard
for a really long time.

01:11:52.079 --> 01:11:53.648
I still love you.

01:11:56.083 --> 01:11:58.019
I wouldn't trade our ten years
for anything.

01:11:59.587 --> 01:12:03.390
So why can't you
just stay together?

01:12:04.559 --> 01:12:07.094
Please. Just... Just...

01:12:07.128 --> 01:12:08.763
Just stay together.

01:12:10.731 --> 01:12:12.633
Sweetie, we can't.

01:12:12.667 --> 01:12:14.501
But you guys can.

01:12:24.078 --> 01:12:27.380
See? Look at that.
Told you.

01:12:34.421 --> 01:12:35.723
They're smiling.

01:12:37.758 --> 01:12:40.027
Thank you.

01:12:40.061 --> 01:12:41.361
Oh.

01:12:42.964 --> 01:12:44.131
Let's do it.

01:12:44.165 --> 01:12:47.635
- I came back.
- Yes, you did.

01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:51.572
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you, too.

01:12:53.875 --> 01:12:55.576
- Well, you...
- Don't.

01:12:55.610 --> 01:12:58.813
- Okay.
- Sorry for calling you a bitch.

01:12:58.846 --> 01:13:01.649
It's okay.
He's a good guy.

01:13:01.682 --> 01:13:04.384
I told you.

01:13:08.689 --> 01:13:10.091
So...

01:13:12.193 --> 01:13:13.561
Yeah.

01:13:23.037 --> 01:13:25.006
We were good, though,
weren't we?

01:13:30.211 --> 01:13:31.746
We were really good.

01:13:51.232 --> 01:13:53.868
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:13:55.202 --> 01:13:57.038
You may kiss the bride.

01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:04.679
Yay!

01:14:39.947 --> 01:14:41.682
Shall we?

01:15:09.977 --> 01:15:11.579
What do we tell people?

01:15:13.914 --> 01:15:16.817
When we get back home
and we see our friends,

01:15:16.851 --> 01:15:18.085
what do we say?

01:15:20.154 --> 01:15:23.257
We tell them...

01:15:23.290 --> 01:15:24.692
we broke up.

01:16:59.053 --> 01:17:03.791
Oh, my God. Guys, I have
the biggest news ever.

01:17:06.694 --> 01:17:08.896
Let's go tell Jayson.

01:17:08.929 --> 01:17:10.364
Let's go.

01:17:15.236 --> 01:17:18.038
Hey, uh, are those my shorts?

01:17:18.072 --> 01:17:20.674
No, they're mine.

01:17:20.708 --> 01:17:22.676
Baby, the oven's broken.
Can you come fix it?

01:17:23.911 --> 01:17:25.746
Why are you recording me?

01:17:25.779 --> 01:17:27.915
Oh, come on, just fix the oven.

01:17:27.948 --> 01:17:30.050
- Please? Come on.
- Okay.

01:17:30.084 --> 01:17:33.154
- What's wrong with it?
- I don't know.

01:17:33.187 --> 01:17:36.257
- Well, it's not on.
- It isn't?

01:17:36.290 --> 01:17:39.860
No. And there's just one
hamburger bun in there.

01:17:39.894 --> 01:17:42.062
What... Are we hav...

01:17:42.096 --> 01:17:44.064
Did you put this in here?

01:17:44.098 --> 01:17:46.367
I... I don't know.

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:48.102
Well, I didn't put it in here.

01:17:48.135 --> 01:17:49.803
Uh, I think you did.

01:17:51.005 --> 01:17:52.840
Okay. What is it again?

01:17:52.873 --> 01:17:54.875
It's a bun in the oven.

01:17:54.909 --> 01:17:56.076
Yep.

01:17:56.110 --> 01:17:58.746
Oh, my God.
Baby, really?

01:17:58.779 --> 01:18:00.447
- Are you really pregnant?
- Yes.

01:18:00.481 --> 01:18:01.815
- Seriously?
- Yes!

01:18:01.849 --> 01:18:03.083
Oh, my God.

01:18:03.117 --> 01:18:04.952
This is the best news ever!

01:18:04.985 --> 01:18:07.755

01:18:10.925 --> 01:18:12.226
