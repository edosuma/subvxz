00:50.313 --> 00:52.380
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

00:52.382 --> 00:54.348
Just wondering. We're making
a little documentary

00:54.350 --> 00:57.651
Do you guys wants
to be interviewed?

00:57.653 --> 00:59.653
No, I don't think so.

01:20.808 --> 01:23.576
A dance that has no beginning
and no end.

01:28.315 --> 01:31.684
Would you wanna talk about
your relationship on camera?

01:31.686 --> 01:33.152
Don't move.

01:34.420 --> 01:36.621
Let the music move you.

01:41.793 --> 01:45.195
How do you move in silence?

01:45.197 --> 01:47.664
If you feel it,
take a partner.

01:57.307 --> 01:59.775
Have both of you been
in long-term relationships

01:59.777 --> 02:01.476
before you met?

02:01.478 --> 02:03.244
- No.
- Not really, no.

02:03.246 --> 02:07.648
So this is like your longest
relationship by far.

02:07.650 --> 02:12.252
We've been together
for almost, what...

02:12.254 --> 02:13.486
- 10 years.
- 10 years.

02:13.488 --> 02:14.854
- 10 years?
- December.

02:14.856 --> 02:16.622
In December,
it'll be 10 years.

02:28.233 --> 02:31.802
We are so much more powerful
when we are not two,

02:31.804 --> 02:33.203
we are one.

02:34.705 --> 02:37.273
- Yeah, I totally liked it.
- Yeah?

02:37.275 --> 02:41.443
Doesn't it feel good?
Doesn't your body feel alive?

02:41.445 --> 02:44.179
- I feel like free and open.
- And light.

02:44.181 --> 02:49.184
I was not making fun.
I was just...

02:49.186 --> 02:51.853
I was just drawing your
attention to your patterns

02:51.855 --> 02:53.254
and your habits.

02:53.256 --> 02:55.556
- And I appreciate it.
- Okay.

02:55.558 --> 02:58.158
Wow. That long-haired guy
was into you.

02:58.160 --> 03:00.593
- He was all over you.
- That's not what it's about.

03:00.595 --> 03:04.597
but the guy I thought was gonna
put his hand down your pants.

03:04.599 --> 03:06.465
Okay, Danny, no, no.

03:06.467 --> 03:08.600
It's not a sexual connection.
It's like...

03:08.602 --> 03:13.204
I just love those guys, how they
pretend they're all spiritual,

03:13.206 --> 03:15.372
and it's really they're trying
to get ass, you know?

03:15.374 --> 03:17.774
- I mean, it's like, come on.
- That's not what's happening.

03:17.776 --> 03:19.742
- Come on, really?
- It's not.

03:19.744 --> 03:22.544
No, it's not.
It's deeper than that.

03:22.546 --> 03:25.580
Listen, I love all this stuff.
It's great. It's really great.

03:25.582 --> 03:30.484
We're kinda pathetic
as a race, you know?

03:30.486 --> 03:32.185
- All guys?
- All guys.

03:32.187 --> 03:35.288
- Including you?
- Well, I'm the one exception.

03:35.290 --> 03:38.190
That's why I notice it
when I see it in other guys.

03:38.192 --> 03:42.527
I'm sensing a little jealous
energy from you right now.

03:42.529 --> 03:43.961
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:43.963 --> 03:45.629
- I'm just looking out for you.
- Oh.

03:45.631 --> 03:47.897
It's all right.
I can handle myself.

03:47.899 --> 03:49.732
I know you can.
That's what I like about you.

03:49.734 --> 03:51.366
Yeah.

03:51.368 --> 03:53.801
- You know what? I...
- What?

03:53.803 --> 03:57.304
I think we should shift this
energy before we go to dinner.

03:57.306 --> 03:58.371
What do you mean?

03:58.373 --> 04:00.306
Can I hug you right now?

04:00.308 --> 04:01.940
Yeah. What, right here?

04:13.285 --> 04:14.785
- All right.
- All right.

04:14.787 --> 04:16.786
That was amazing.

04:16.789 --> 04:19.389
- Good. Feel good?
- Totally. How did you do that?

04:19.391 --> 04:21.524
Just changing the energy
a little.

04:21.526 --> 04:23.726
You're so good at that.

04:23.728 --> 04:26.228
We all are, Danny.

04:26.230 --> 04:27.729
I like it here.

04:27.731 --> 04:29.397
It's beautiful.
Beautiful spot.

04:29.399 --> 04:30.831
Yeah, it's got a good feel.

04:30.833 --> 04:32.566
Great place to come
after the dance.

04:32.568 --> 04:35.001
It is! It is a good place
to come after the dance.

04:35.003 --> 04:36.535
- It's all raw, right?
- Yeah.

04:36.537 --> 04:38.470
Or is it some? All raw.

04:38.472 --> 04:41.005
- Is that okay?
- Absolutely.

04:41.007 --> 04:43.974
- You sure?
- Love raw.

04:43.976 --> 04:46.977
It's really nice.
I can't wait.

04:46.979 --> 04:48.845
Hi.

04:48.847 --> 04:51.881
- Hi.
- Hi, hi, hi.

05:13.002 --> 05:14.469
Thank you.

05:16.805 --> 05:17.805
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:17.807 --> 05:19.573
This is Danny.

05:19.575 --> 05:21.341
- Hi, Danny.
- Nice to meet you.

05:21.343 --> 05:23.376
- This is Gayle.
- Hi, Gayle,

05:23.378 --> 05:24.677
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

05:24.679 --> 05:28.447
Just a moment of sadness.

05:28.449 --> 05:29.948
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:29.950 --> 05:33.918
- But it's passed.
- That's good.

05:33.920 --> 05:35.519
- I haven't seen you in so long!
- I know!

05:35.521 --> 05:37.654
- The moment's gone.
- I know.

05:37.656 --> 05:40.723
I know, but it's so good
to see you now.

05:40.725 --> 05:43.692
- You too.
- She is so special.

05:43.694 --> 05:48.029
We all are. We all are.

05:50.399 --> 05:51.565
- Green smoothie?
- Yes.

05:51.567 --> 05:55.368
- Uh, what is it?
- Yeah. Just say yes.

05:55.370 --> 05:57.503
Yes, I'm saying yes
to everything today.

05:57.505 --> 05:58.971
Yes to the world.

05:58.973 --> 06:03.875
The service here is phenomenal.
It really is.

06:03.877 --> 06:05.610
So you wanted to know
about my open relationship?

06:05.612 --> 06:07.612
If you're okay with that.

06:07.614 --> 06:10.081
- Sure.
- Yeah.

06:10.083 --> 06:12.583
So basically how it worked
is I had a primary partner,

06:12.585 --> 06:15.919
and he had another
girlfriend in L.A.,

06:15.921 --> 06:17.954
and he would see her
when he was there.

06:17.956 --> 06:20.623
Wow. So you knew that
that was going on.

06:20.625 --> 06:23.492
- Yeah, yeah.
- Wow.

06:23.494 --> 06:26.661
It was a very open...
open relationship.

06:26.663 --> 06:28.496
Hence the name.

06:28.498 --> 06:30.531
And were you ever seeing
somebody at that time too?

06:30.533 --> 06:32.666
Um...

06:32.668 --> 06:36.636
I explored things a little
with some people, but...

06:36.638 --> 06:38.037
nothing really stuck.

06:38.039 --> 06:42.074
So you didn't feel jealous
or anything like that?

06:42.076 --> 06:43.842
- No.
- That's amazing.

06:43.844 --> 06:46.044
No, no, no.
She was really amazing.

06:46.046 --> 06:48.713
She was great,
and she was great for him.

06:48.715 --> 06:50.514
So this is something like
you guys would talk about.

06:50.516 --> 06:51.915
Yeah.

06:51.917 --> 06:56.052
because it's sort of
totally what I'm looking for.

06:56.054 --> 06:58.621
Oh, yeah?

06:58.623 --> 07:00.823
No. I mean,
not like that.

07:00.825 --> 07:03.091
I mean, it sounds
interesting to me, maybe,

07:03.093 --> 07:05.927
but just more
in terms of the film.

07:05.929 --> 07:10.097
Like that's why I would like
to interview you on camera

07:10.099 --> 07:13.033
and have you explain
your experience

07:13.035 --> 07:14.768
with an open relationship.

07:14.770 --> 07:17.036
If you'd be into that.

07:17.038 --> 07:18.737
Sure, Dan.

07:20.140 --> 07:23.374
All right. Let me try
and explain this to you.

07:23.376 --> 07:24.541
I feel like
you're not getting it.

07:24.543 --> 07:25.775
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:25.777 --> 07:27.510
- I'm trying.
- I know.

07:27.512 --> 07:29.111
It's like I'm here with you
right now, right?

07:29.113 --> 07:32.514
But I'm not totally present
with you

07:32.516 --> 07:35.950
because I feel very drawn
to that person over there.

07:35.952 --> 07:38.552
- The guy with the book?
- Yeah.

07:38.554 --> 07:40.086
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:40.088 --> 07:41.520
He's your type?

07:43.022 --> 07:45.823
Wait.
Are you being serious?

07:45.825 --> 07:47.858
Because it's not
a reality to me.

07:47.860 --> 07:49.659
I invent some fantasy
in my mind

07:49.661 --> 07:54.897
and follow my impulse
and see what's drawing me.

07:54.899 --> 07:56.899
What, you mean you
really wanna do that?

07:56.901 --> 07:59.768
Or are you making
like an example?

08:06.775 --> 08:07.975
- Hi.
- Hey.

08:07.977 --> 08:10.177
- How are you?
- I'm good.

08:10.179 --> 08:12.979
- Good. I'm John.
- Theresa.

08:32.097 --> 08:34.498
It was nice to have met you.

08:34.500 --> 08:35.932
Thanks, John.

08:40.669 --> 08:43.972
What the hell was that?

08:43.974 --> 08:47.508
So that was totally not
what I thought it was gonna be.

08:47.510 --> 08:49.943
What was it?

08:49.945 --> 08:51.811
But now I can just,
you know,

08:51.813 --> 08:55.447
I can just let it go,
and I can be here with you.

08:55.449 --> 08:58.082
Totally and completely.

08:58.084 --> 09:00.584
- Wow.
- Right?

09:00.586 --> 09:02.686
Actually, that might be a little
too much for me at the moment.

09:05.791 --> 09:06.890
But okay.

09:50.230 --> 09:51.763
Hey.

09:51.765 --> 09:54.499
- Hi.
- Mmm.

09:54.501 --> 09:56.601
- How are you?
- Good.

09:56.603 --> 09:58.970
- Are you tired?
- Mm-hmm.

09:58.972 --> 10:00.604
- Already?
- Yeah.

10:00.606 --> 10:03.807
- It's so early though.
- Not that early.

10:19.956 --> 10:22.157
- Okay.
- What?

10:22.159 --> 10:24.859
Um, do you wanna stay
and just sleep?

10:24.861 --> 10:28.062
Uh, is that my only option?

10:28.064 --> 10:30.798
- Maybe tonight, yeah.
- Tonight it is.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.666
All right, awesome.

10:32.668 --> 10:33.833
Let's sleep.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.803
You're that tired?

10:37.805 --> 10:40.105
- I am.
- Oh.

10:41.974 --> 10:44.875
Mmm!

10:44.877 --> 10:46.978
I need to do some dreaming.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.379
- Some dreaming?
- Yeah.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.981
All right.

10:50.983 --> 10:53.717
- Will you turn off the light?
- Yeah, I'm gonna do it.

10:53.719 --> 10:55.385
That's good.

10:58.722 --> 11:00.989
Well, all right then.
Good night.

11:00.991 --> 11:03.424
Good night.

11:03.426 --> 11:05.993
Blessed dreams.

11:05.995 --> 11:07.995
Blessed dreams to you too.

11:09.697 --> 11:12.265
Why do you torture yourself
with these women, Danny?

11:12.267 --> 11:14.867
Is it just for the film?
Is it worth it?

11:14.869 --> 11:18.437
It's about the film,
but she's a nice person.

11:18.439 --> 11:22.808
the film is just an extension
of where I'm at lately.

11:22.810 --> 11:24.810
And yeah, maybe I'm getting
a little involved with her,

11:24.812 --> 11:27.979
but it's sort of
part of the work.

11:27.981 --> 11:31.682
Right, but it's like this
girl's got your brainwashed.

11:31.684 --> 11:34.317
If she doesn't wanna
have sex, then...

11:34.319 --> 11:35.985
suddenly you
don't wanna have sex.

11:35.987 --> 11:39.888
Obviously I would like
to have sex more than I do.

11:39.890 --> 11:43.157
I think you're better
than this situation.

11:43.159 --> 11:45.092
Well, thank you.
I appreciate you saying that,

11:45.094 --> 11:47.961
but I feel more connected
sometimes

11:47.963 --> 11:50.697
when we don't have sex.

11:50.699 --> 11:52.865
But I know what you're saying
because at the same time,

11:52.867 --> 11:54.366
there's like...

11:54.368 --> 11:56.201
I would really like to get...

11:56.203 --> 11:57.869
Your cock sucked?

11:57.871 --> 12:00.071
It might be nice.

12:00.073 --> 12:02.073
This is what I'm saying!

12:02.075 --> 12:03.974
There comes a time
when, you know,

12:03.976 --> 12:06.076
every woman knows
you gotta suck a cock!

12:06.078 --> 12:08.244
How would you know that?

12:08.246 --> 12:09.979
'Cause I've done it before?

12:09.981 --> 12:10.946
You've sucked a cock.

12:10.948 --> 12:12.747
Yeah.

12:12.749 --> 12:14.715
When was this, and how come
I didn't know about it?

12:14.717 --> 12:16.983
My man days.
You know about my man days.

12:16.985 --> 12:18.451
No, I don't.
You had man days?

12:18.453 --> 12:20.786
- Does Emmy know about it?
- Yeah.

12:20.788 --> 12:22.888
She does?
And she's cool with it?

12:22.890 --> 12:25.123
Well, she can't
do much about it.

12:25.125 --> 12:27.758
They came before her.

12:27.760 --> 12:29.025
That's amazing.

12:29.027 --> 12:31.794
I mean, it doesn't surprise me.

12:31.796 --> 12:35.397
I've seen you with men,
and I've thought like,

12:35.399 --> 12:37.899
"For a lesbian,
she's very flirty with men."

12:39.135 --> 12:41.468
No, I'm just kidding.

12:41.470 --> 12:43.303
- I'm kidding.
- I have to open the studio.

12:43.305 --> 12:47.507
If I pull down with two hands,
it's a fumble!

12:47.509 --> 12:49.509
You should actually
have a relationship

12:49.511 --> 12:51.210
instead of making movies
about them.

12:51.212 --> 12:52.911
It's so boring!

12:52.913 --> 12:54.946
I mean, what did
Woody Allen say?

12:54.948 --> 12:56.981
He said, "I can only live
in my art, not in my life."

12:56.983 --> 12:59.183
And I totally relate.

12:59.185 --> 13:00.984
- What?
- It's so fucked up

13:00.986 --> 13:03.252
that you're taking life advice
from Woody Allen.

13:03.254 --> 13:04.753
I'm not taking
life advice from him.

13:04.755 --> 13:07.322
I'm just saying I relate.

13:07.324 --> 13:10.024
I don't know. I think
I just like being alone.

13:10.026 --> 13:11.959
You gotta stop
saying that, dude.

13:11.961 --> 13:14.461
- Why? It's true.
- I know it's true,

13:14.463 --> 13:16.229
but when you say that to girls
when they first meet you,

13:16.231 --> 13:17.496
they think you're a weirdo.

13:17.498 --> 13:19.498
- I am a weirdo.
- No, you're not.

13:19.500 --> 13:22.467
You're not a weirdo
because you like to be alone

13:22.469 --> 13:23.534
some of the time.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.135
That's totally natural.

13:25.137 --> 13:27.137
Everybody feels like that.

13:28.439 --> 13:31.007
I just like being
in my day, you know?

13:31.009 --> 13:35.044
- That's great.
- Is it great?

13:35.046 --> 13:38.213
how could it be any better
than this right now?

13:38.215 --> 13:41.182
We got music,
it's two degrees outside,

13:41.184 --> 13:43.150
we're having coffee.

13:43.152 --> 13:45.252
I mean, getting laid would be
nice every once in a while.

13:45.254 --> 13:47.988
Totally.
How long has it been?

13:47.990 --> 13:50.123
I'd rather not say.

13:51.492 --> 13:53.226
Oh, my God.

13:53.228 --> 13:55.261
- What?
- Oh, my God.

13:55.263 --> 13:59.265
How many weeks?
It's been months!

13:59.267 --> 14:01.267
- Will you stop?
- How many months?

14:01.269 --> 14:03.168
Maybe-- I don't know.
I don't have a sex calendar

14:03.170 --> 14:05.270
where I mark off the days.

14:05.272 --> 14:07.238
It was definitely warmer
the last time I had sex.

14:07.240 --> 14:09.473
- Oh, my God.
- It's not that big a deal.

14:09.475 --> 14:11.908
You remember it's like
some distant season.

14:11.910 --> 14:14.043
In spring.
There were buds on the tree.

14:14.045 --> 14:15.511
Will you have sex
with my friend?

14:15.513 --> 14:16.812
Ow.

14:19.249 --> 14:20.848
You are so in love with him.

14:20.850 --> 14:23.283
Shut up.

14:23.285 --> 14:26.119
I'm not in love with him,
I just love him.

14:26.121 --> 14:28.454
There is a distinction.

14:28.456 --> 14:31.423
You know,
he's sweet and charming,

14:31.425 --> 14:34.559
and I just wanna see him
with a nice girl, that's all.

14:34.561 --> 14:37.562
Maybe he doesn't want
a nice girl.

14:37.564 --> 14:39.330
Oh, come on.
Of course he does.

14:39.332 --> 14:41.031
Who doesn't want
a nice girl?

14:41.033 --> 14:42.298
I don't know.

14:42.300 --> 14:44.166
Maybe he likes being alone.

14:44.168 --> 14:47.035
That's what he says, but...

14:47.037 --> 14:48.870
I don't know.
I don't buy it.

14:48.872 --> 14:50.838
Why not?

14:50.840 --> 14:53.473
I love that he doesn't need
to be with someone all the time.

14:53.475 --> 14:55.308
I'm not saying he needs to
be with someone all the time.

14:55.310 --> 14:58.444
Just, you know,
some of time.

14:58.446 --> 15:01.613
I mean, I've never seen him
with anyone except these...

15:01.615 --> 15:04.082
creepy new-age girls
who torture him.

15:04.084 --> 15:07.485
I mean, you would not
believe some of things

15:07.487 --> 15:09.620
he's told me
these girls say and do,

15:09.622 --> 15:11.922
in the name of
going with the flow.

15:11.924 --> 15:13.023
It sucks.

15:15.159 --> 15:17.059
I know.

15:19.962 --> 15:21.862
Yeah?

15:21.864 --> 15:23.196
Hmm?

15:25.332 --> 15:26.965
You know?
What do you know?

15:26.967 --> 15:29.233
What do you mean?

15:29.235 --> 15:31.401
Oh, my God,
I caught you!

15:31.403 --> 15:36.105
Em, I know when you're
not listening to me.

15:36.107 --> 15:37.573
I'm sorry.

15:37.575 --> 15:39.141
- Unbelievable.
- I'm sorry!

15:39.143 --> 15:40.575
I'm distracted.

15:40.577 --> 15:42.910
You know that work
is crazy right now.

15:42.912 --> 15:45.345
So why don't you close your
computer and hang out with me?

15:45.347 --> 15:47.947
I will in a second.

15:47.949 --> 15:49.915
Let me just do
this one thing, okay?

15:49.917 --> 15:53.084
I'm meeting with the election
committee woman tomorrow.

15:53.086 --> 15:55.453
- Okay.
- What?

15:57.355 --> 15:59.923
Nothing.

16:02.027 --> 16:04.160
What are you doing?

16:04.162 --> 16:06.128
- Nothing.
- Mm-hmm.

16:13.102 --> 16:17.438
I thought you were
making us dinner.

16:17.440 --> 16:19.940
It's cookin', good-lookin'.

16:22.611 --> 16:25.912
- So tell me this.
- Mm-hmm.

16:25.914 --> 16:29.682
Can your election
committee woman do this?

16:31.419 --> 16:33.419
Stop that.
That's disgusting.

16:36.055 --> 16:38.656
Oh, come on.

16:38.658 --> 16:41.524
- Do not be mad at me.
- I'm not mad.

16:50.533 --> 16:53.234
I'm very, very sorry.

16:53.236 --> 16:55.236
You did stick your tongue
in my ear.

16:55.238 --> 16:57.471
It's kinda wet and gross.

16:59.707 --> 17:02.542
No. You know what?
I'm not into it anymore.

17:02.544 --> 17:06.145
Yes, you are. You're always
into it, you little nymph.

17:06.146 --> 17:08.946
- Fuck off.
- Sweetie...

17:08.949 --> 17:12.116
I'm sorry if I'm attracted
to my girlfriend.

17:12.117 --> 17:15.051
I was kidding.

17:15.054 --> 17:17.154
Come on, I was kidding.

17:17.156 --> 17:18.454
Huh?

17:18.457 --> 17:20.522
Huh?

17:20.525 --> 17:22.290
- Huh?
- You always do this!

17:22.292 --> 17:24.126
- What?
- No, you know what?

17:24.127 --> 17:26.694
If I have to explain it,
just forget it.

17:26.696 --> 17:29.130
Come on.

17:29.132 --> 17:31.632
Don't be such
a little baby, huh?

17:31.634 --> 17:34.568
- Can't take a joke suddenly.
- Fuck you.

17:34.570 --> 17:37.337
Why aren't you ticklish?
It's so unfair.

17:37.339 --> 17:39.972
Oh, fuck off.
I'm going.

17:39.974 --> 17:43.375
I'll make you your dinner,
madam!

17:43.377 --> 17:45.510
One of these nights,
you're cooking.

17:46.612 --> 17:48.212
In your dreams,
sweet cakes.

17:48.214 --> 17:50.514
Oh, my God.

17:50.516 --> 17:54.518
Why do I have to be
the mom?

17:54.520 --> 17:58.388
Uh, I think I burnt this.

17:58.390 --> 18:02.759
<i>Well, it doesn't</i>
<i> make a lot of sense</i>

18:02.761 --> 18:05.361
<i>because I have</i>
<i> a really close friendship...</i>

18:05.363 --> 18:07.396
Hey, did you finish
the behind-the-scenes?

18:07.398 --> 18:11.500
Oh, that was
the airline thing.

18:11.502 --> 18:14.002
No, before that.
What is that you're working on?

18:14.004 --> 18:15.470
It was nothing.

18:15.472 --> 18:18.706
- No.
- Everybody does it. Show me.

18:18.708 --> 18:20.774
- Really?
- Please. I'm bored.

18:20.776 --> 18:22.675
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

18:22.677 --> 18:25.678
It's this doc that I've been
working on for years.

18:25.680 --> 18:27.579
It's going to be a cure
for boredom,

18:27.581 --> 18:30.348
but if you really wanna
see it, uh, here.

18:30.350 --> 18:31.782
What's it about?

18:31.784 --> 18:34.618
It's about uh,
you know, people's lives

18:34.620 --> 18:36.786
and relationships and...
Here.

18:36.788 --> 18:39.255
<i>I started like...</i>
<i> I don't...</i>

18:39.257 --> 18:41.290
<i>I... First of all...</i>

18:41.292 --> 18:43.659
I did the camera shake
intentionally.

18:43.661 --> 18:46.328
Yeah, it looks like
a battle scene or something.

18:46.330 --> 18:48.330
<i>...to avoid it.</i>

18:48.332 --> 18:50.198
Back-lit.
It's supposed to look bad.

18:50.200 --> 18:53.100
So is she,
is she like mentally ill?

18:53.102 --> 18:55.168
No, she's not mentally ill.

18:55.170 --> 18:58.137
She's just talking about
her relationship history.

18:58.139 --> 19:00.439
Romantic relationships.

19:00.441 --> 19:03.208
Or other kinds. If they don't
have romantic relationships,

19:03.210 --> 19:04.776
then how they, you know,

19:04.778 --> 19:07.612
subvert that emotion
in other ways

19:07.614 --> 19:10.448
and, you know,
just connection, basically.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.516
Highbrow.

19:12.518 --> 19:14.418
Sort of, but I don't know
where it's going right now.

19:14.420 --> 19:16.853
I'm just trying to find
the heart of the doc.

19:16.855 --> 19:19.789
Hey, there he is.
Zack, what's up?

19:19.791 --> 19:22.324
done by the end
of the day, right?

19:22.326 --> 19:26.561
Yeah, I was just, uh,
I put that in the bin for you.

19:26.563 --> 19:29.330
Is this still H.264?

19:29.332 --> 19:31.398
- Oh, we're great.
- Yeah.

19:31.400 --> 19:33.800
- Yeah, no problem.
- You got it.

19:35.702 --> 19:36.668
Did you start this?

19:36.670 --> 19:38.703
No, not at all.

19:38.705 --> 19:41.472
- All right, uh...
- You got it?

19:41.474 --> 19:42.706
Yeah, I'm on it.

19:42.708 --> 19:45.208
All right. okay.
Thanks, man.

19:45.210 --> 19:46.609
Oh, hey, speaking
of relationships.

19:46.611 --> 19:49.712
You still with that
hot freaky chick?

19:49.714 --> 19:51.513
- Oh, Theresa?
- Yeah.

19:51.515 --> 19:53.715
She is hot.
Not that freaky though.

19:53.717 --> 19:55.583
She's into that
like new-agey stuff.

19:55.585 --> 19:58.719
I mean, with her?
I don't know.

19:58.721 --> 20:01.488
because she's into
open relationships,

20:01.490 --> 20:03.289
so it's a little weird.

20:03.291 --> 20:04.890
- It's perfect.
- Really?

20:04.892 --> 20:07.559
Dude, don't fuck it up
by asking questions.

20:07.561 --> 20:08.793
You're probably right.

20:08.795 --> 20:10.728
Seriously, yeah.

20:10.730 --> 20:13.530
- All right, man.
- I'll see ya.

20:13.532 --> 20:16.666
<i>...relationship rather than</i>
<i> just being myself, so...</i>

20:18.869 --> 20:21.470
<i>I'm uncomfortable,</i>
<i> and I want out.</i>

20:22.438 --> 20:24.639
What?

20:24.641 --> 20:27.908
All right, Mr. Cameraman,
what do you wanna know?

20:27.910 --> 20:31.611
Give me some good stories
about open relationships.

20:31.613 --> 20:33.679
Um, okay.

20:33.681 --> 20:38.750
Um, my primary partner
had his L.A. girlfriend

20:38.752 --> 20:40.651
come in to town once,

20:40.653 --> 20:45.656
and I was going to New Jersey
to stay with my parents,

20:45.658 --> 20:49.926
and I spent the whole day
cleaning and getting ready,

20:49.928 --> 20:52.295
and I bought flowers.

20:52.297 --> 20:53.963
Oh, my God.

20:53.965 --> 20:57.499
Yeah, I just wanted it
to be perfect for them.

20:57.501 --> 20:59.634
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:59.636 --> 21:02.003
That seems so amazing to me
that you can just like--

21:02.005 --> 21:04.505
So you don't have
jealousy at all, ever?

21:04.507 --> 21:07.374
- No.
- Come on.

21:07.376 --> 21:08.842
No, we're all on
our own paths, you know?

21:08.844 --> 21:11.878
Everybody's got...

21:11.880 --> 21:14.881
their own needs.

21:14.883 --> 21:18.317
But do you even have the
feeling, and then you say, like,

21:18.319 --> 21:20.419
"I'm not going to go
with this feeling,"

21:20.421 --> 21:23.788
or do you just not even have
the feeling of jealousy?

21:26.491 --> 21:29.392
Um...

21:29.394 --> 21:32.395
The only feeling I have is like,
"Oh, I really wish..."

21:34.464 --> 21:38.300
If I suddenly wish that he
was there, but he's not there.

21:38.302 --> 21:39.768
Mm-hmm.

21:39.770 --> 21:42.670
But that's, you know,
that's my own shit.

21:42.672 --> 21:44.805
That's your own shit?

21:44.807 --> 21:47.407
My teabag says,
"You are unlimited."

21:47.409 --> 21:50.443
You are unlimited.
What does mine say?

21:50.445 --> 21:52.578
Trust creates peace.

21:52.580 --> 21:54.813
- Oh, see?
- That's appropriate.

21:54.815 --> 21:56.948
Can we put the camera
away now?

21:56.950 --> 22:01.953
I know, but sometimes
I just wanna be here.

22:01.955 --> 22:03.454
Okay.

22:03.456 --> 22:05.722
Just the two of us.

22:05.724 --> 22:07.724
Without a camera between us.

22:07.726 --> 22:09.726
- That sounds good.
- Yeah.

22:13.598 --> 22:15.030
- Good breath.
- I know.

22:15.032 --> 22:17.565
- I'm getting better at this.
- You are.

22:19.801 --> 22:22.435
It's so interesting
to do this, isn't it?

22:22.437 --> 22:24.503
It's good. Feels good.

22:24.505 --> 22:27.439
Yeah, 'cause it's funny,
the first few times we did it,

22:27.441 --> 22:31.976
it's like, the eye contact
always seems to be like,

22:31.978 --> 22:36.347
we should either make out
or cry or you know...

22:36.349 --> 22:38.082
- Yeah.
- But...

22:38.084 --> 22:40.951
- You don't have to talk.
- You don't have to do it.

22:40.953 --> 22:43.820
- I should shut up now.
- You don't have to qualify it.

22:45.556 --> 22:47.990
See? So much better.

22:47.992 --> 22:49.858
Totally.

22:55.030 --> 22:56.497
We'll take it
to the next level.

22:56.499 --> 22:57.998
All right.

23:02.536 --> 23:04.970
That's good.

23:04.972 --> 23:06.938
- That's nice.
- Yeah?

23:14.646 --> 23:17.047
- That's good.
- Wow.

23:17.049 --> 23:19.549
- Feel good?
- That's amazing.

23:19.551 --> 23:23.819
Yeah, that's like third-eye
to third-eye, you know?

23:23.821 --> 23:26.121
It's like kind of
an inner seeing.

23:26.123 --> 23:27.889
- Do you wanna, um...
- I like it.

23:27.891 --> 23:30.658
Do you wanna trade massages
right now?

23:30.660 --> 23:34.795
I would love that.
You mean like right here?

23:34.797 --> 23:37.898
- No, let's go upstairs.
- Okay.

23:37.900 --> 23:39.566
- Should we bring our tea?
- Bring your tea.

23:39.568 --> 23:42.468
Trust is peace.

23:42.470 --> 23:44.536
Trust is peace.

23:44.538 --> 23:45.837
Oh, that feels good.

23:45.839 --> 23:47.905
- Really?
- Oh, my God.

23:47.907 --> 23:49.506
Yeah, you got
some tension going on.

23:49.508 --> 23:50.840
- Whew!
- Wow.

23:50.842 --> 23:53.709
Too much?

23:53.711 --> 23:54.976
- It's a lot.
- It's a lot?

23:54.978 --> 23:57.478
It's a lot,
but in a good way.

23:57.480 --> 23:58.712
Oh, my goodness.

23:58.714 --> 24:01.381
- Yeah, you need that.
- Ooh!

24:02.883 --> 24:04.783
This shirt is kinda
getting in the way here.

24:04.785 --> 24:06.918
Do you wanna take it off
and then we can use the oil?

24:06.920 --> 24:10.588
All right, sure.
Yeah, let's do that.

24:10.590 --> 24:12.990
Let's see,
this looks like good...

24:14.993 --> 24:16.827
- massage oil.
- See where the oil is?

24:16.829 --> 24:18.962
Yeah, it's pretty handy here.

24:18.964 --> 24:20.830
You must get massages a lot.

24:20.832 --> 24:23.666
Well, sometimes,
when I'm lucky.

24:23.668 --> 24:26.402
It's a nice thing to do.

24:26.404 --> 24:28.102
All right, here we go.

24:31.673 --> 24:33.607
This'll be nice.

24:43.916 --> 24:46.117
- Do these go up?
- Mm-hmm.

24:49.654 --> 24:51.921
I need more oil for this.

25:09.171 --> 25:11.905
- It's a very kissable back.
- Oh, okay.

25:14.508 --> 25:16.876
- It's just part of the massage.
- Oh, okay.

25:16.878 --> 25:18.744
It's a very...

25:18.746 --> 25:20.178
special technique I have.

25:20.180 --> 25:22.513
I see. Uh...

25:22.515 --> 25:23.780
- Danny.
- What?

25:23.782 --> 25:25.581
- I...
- What?

25:25.583 --> 25:27.516
- I think maybe we should stop.
- What do you mean?

25:27.518 --> 25:28.817
This is just getting going.

25:28.819 --> 25:31.119
Yeah, I just,
I'm not really...

25:31.121 --> 25:32.987
- I think we should stop.
- What? Really?

25:32.989 --> 25:36.156
Yeah, yeah, I just, um...

25:36.158 --> 25:38.191
I just don't wanna be
sexual right now.

25:38.193 --> 25:40.826
- Oh, no, I don't either.
- Okay, good.

25:40.828 --> 25:42.527
It just doesn't...
Hate isn't what wants to happen.

25:42.529 --> 25:45.196
Oh, okay, sorry.

25:45.198 --> 25:48.065
I just get a little excited
because you're so beautiful.

25:48.067 --> 25:51.068
Oh, that's so nice.
That's so nice.

25:51.070 --> 25:54.004
Okay, so much love,
so much love.

25:54.006 --> 25:55.538
Yeah.

25:55.540 --> 25:56.972
Mmm!

25:59.709 --> 26:02.110
- This is nice.
- Yeah.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.779
Although, it still does
feel slightly sexual,

26:05.781 --> 26:08.748
I understand, I understand.

26:12.219 --> 26:15.054
Just gonna help myself
out here where I can.

26:15.056 --> 26:16.889
See? There we go.

26:16.891 --> 26:18.523
Perfect.
That looks great.

26:18.525 --> 26:20.157
- Now can I hug you?
- Absolutely,

26:20.159 --> 26:22.492
- Now it's like we're cousins.
- Okay.

26:22.494 --> 26:23.893
Mmm.

26:26.263 --> 26:28.597
Yeah, this is great.
I don't feel anything.

26:30.967 --> 26:33.969
Well, um, we were...

26:33.971 --> 26:36.705
should I look at you
or should I look at your thing?

26:36.707 --> 26:38.773
Into the lens
or at your face?

26:38.775 --> 26:41.542
- No, you can look at me.
- Okay.

26:41.544 --> 26:45.779
- Um, I was into her for a--

26:45.781 --> 26:47.781
a long time, a while.

26:47.783 --> 26:50.817
- She was?
- Did I talk during your turn?

26:50.819 --> 26:53.786
- Um, yeah, you did.
- Oh, my God.

26:53.788 --> 26:56.522
I'm so excited that there is
documentation of this

26:56.524 --> 26:58.624
because we can
actually rewind.

26:58.626 --> 27:02.094
First of all, you did talk
through my whole turn.

27:02.096 --> 27:06.064
And second of all,
it doesn't actually matter

27:06.066 --> 27:08.099
'cause technically
there are no turns.

27:08.101 --> 27:11.168
That's good.
I like the bickering too.

27:11.170 --> 27:13.103
- .Keep that going.
- Oh, great.

27:13.105 --> 27:17.740
So, um, she was
going out with a guy.

27:17.742 --> 27:19.908
- A man person.
- A man person.

27:19.910 --> 27:22.110
And so I didn't even know
if it was a possibility.

27:22.112 --> 27:25.580
- And she was dating a shrew.
- That is not true.

27:25.582 --> 27:27.315
- She was--
- Oh, my God, she was awful.

27:27.317 --> 27:29.850
She was this
controlling psychopath

27:29.852 --> 27:32.285
who literally never laughed.

27:32.287 --> 27:34.287
She did laugh.

27:34.289 --> 27:37.290
She laughed
all the time in private.

27:37.292 --> 27:39.959
You don't think that's weird?

27:39.961 --> 27:41.827
- A little bit.
- You're not allowed to ask him.

27:41.829 --> 27:43.261
She's a private laugher.

27:43.263 --> 27:46.797
She can't ask you
for validation.

27:46.799 --> 27:49.833
Um... You are so mean.

27:49.835 --> 27:54.337
when your partner's last person
was such a square

27:54.339 --> 27:56.740
because it's so easy
to please them.

27:56.742 --> 27:58.808
All I have to do is
laugh over brunch,

27:58.810 --> 28:00.843
and you feel like
I'm the most delightful woman

28:00.845 --> 28:02.911
you ever dated.

28:04.381 --> 28:06.714
Um, oh, my God.

28:06.716 --> 28:09.083
You're such a bitch.

28:09.085 --> 28:10.684
Do you have any fistfights?

28:10.686 --> 28:14.354
'Cause I feel like we could do
a cat fight for you.

28:14.356 --> 28:17.790
That's nice, but let's go back
to Carla and her man.

28:17.792 --> 28:19.224
Oh, God, do we
actually have to?

28:19.226 --> 28:21.226
And had you
dated men before, Carla?

28:21.228 --> 28:23.962
- You know this.
- I know it, yeah,

28:23.964 --> 28:25.997
but we're talking to the rest
of the film audience here.

28:25.999 --> 28:29.233
All right, sorry. Um...

28:29.235 --> 28:31.001
- Yeah, let's hear it.
- Shut up.

28:31.003 --> 28:32.736
What's the other story?

28:32.738 --> 28:36.740
So I wasn't
that comfortable with it,

28:36.742 --> 28:40.944
and I, uh...

28:40.946 --> 28:43.846
and I wasn't out.

28:43.848 --> 28:47.850
So I was dating Brad
and experimenting with women.

28:47.852 --> 28:52.320
And Brad knew about
this experimentation?

28:52.322 --> 28:54.121
No, no.

28:54.123 --> 28:57.724
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

28:57.726 --> 29:01.728
And Emmy was friends
with his sister.

29:01.730 --> 29:05.164
Oh.
Was that weird?

29:08.501 --> 29:11.269
This is good stuff.
This is really good.

29:11.271 --> 29:14.939
Yeah, well, you know,
it was a long time ago, so...

29:23.982 --> 29:25.983
That's it. We don't have
to talk about Brad anymore

29:25.985 --> 29:30.186
'cause this has really
gone down a different turn here.

29:31.388 --> 29:33.355
No, I... She's right.

29:33.357 --> 29:35.857
It's probably--
I just feel bad about it.

29:35.859 --> 29:37.959
Okay, we don't have
to talk about him anymore.

29:37.961 --> 29:39.226
It's fine.

29:41.095 --> 29:43.329
So because
she was dating Brad,

29:43.331 --> 29:46.899
I didn't know
if it was a possibility.

29:46.901 --> 29:48.467
Back to me.

29:48.469 --> 29:50.535
Take it back to you.

29:50.537 --> 29:55.839
But then I found out
about all this experimenting.

29:55.841 --> 29:57.440
And that was it?

29:57.442 --> 29:59.141
And that was it.

29:59.143 --> 30:02.210
And the buck stopped there.

30:02.212 --> 30:04.445
Let's hope.

30:04.447 --> 30:05.546
So far.

30:10.118 --> 30:14.054
- We can cut it now.
- Okay.

30:14.056 --> 30:16.823
- Why?
- You are not talking to Brad.

30:16.825 --> 30:18.191
I have to talk to him.

30:18.193 --> 30:22.328
The subject reveals
where the story goes.

30:22.330 --> 30:25.097
Didn't you see <i> Hoop Dreams?</i>

30:26.567 --> 30:29.401
No, really.
You can't talk to him.

30:29.403 --> 30:33.037
- Why not?
- Because he was traumatized.

30:33.039 --> 30:36.874
Seriously, he's my only ex
that I don't talk to anymore,

30:36.876 --> 30:39.276
and it ruined the relationship
between Emmy and his sister.

30:39.278 --> 30:40.977
I'm gonna be totally
sensitive to that.

30:40.979 --> 30:42.578
It's a really
bad idea, dude.

30:42.580 --> 30:44.546
It's not.
No, it's a good idea.

30:44.548 --> 30:48.550
This documentary is gonna
bring everyone back together.

30:48.552 --> 30:50.418
- Oh, my God.
- And it's gonna be great.

30:50.420 --> 30:52.119
You guys are gonna
go to the premiere.

30:52.121 --> 30:56.189
- I'm serious, Danny.
- I'm serious too.

30:56.191 --> 30:58.424
Actually, do you wanna become
the center of this film?

30:58.426 --> 31:00.259
You know, it's so sweet
of you to ask me that

31:00.261 --> 31:02.461
because I've been wanting
to say to you that,

31:02.463 --> 31:04.596
"Yes, I want to be
the center of your film!"

31:04.598 --> 31:09.867
Oh, my God.
You're fucking with me, right?

31:09.869 --> 31:11.602
- No.
- This is not okay.

31:45.169 --> 31:47.170
Holy shit.

31:47.172 --> 31:49.539
- That's Rosie.
- Wow.

31:49.541 --> 31:52.108
She just ate that pigeon
over there in the grass.

31:52.110 --> 31:54.043
Yeah, rubbed one out.

31:55.412 --> 31:57.980
Bobby and Violet
were there years ago,

31:57.982 --> 32:01.416
and then Violet died
and this one moved in.

32:01.418 --> 32:04.919
Bobby and Rosie, they live
together in the white building,

32:04.921 --> 32:07.021
or that red building over there,
those two windows.

32:07.023 --> 32:10.224
Her and Bobby met right up there
on top of the building up there.

32:10.226 --> 32:12.426
But Bobby had his choice.

32:12.428 --> 32:17.597
because he watched her catch it
right here in the grass.

32:17.599 --> 32:20.232
And she was messed up.
She died.

32:20.234 --> 32:22.534
- She ended up dying.
- Oh, man.

32:22.536 --> 32:25.336
But then she moved in.
She just took off.

32:25.338 --> 32:27.004
Where did she go?

32:28.339 --> 32:30.273
- I lost her.
- I know.

32:30.275 --> 32:32.341
Where'd she go?
Did you see her?

32:51.126 --> 32:54.427
<i>Um, so, well,</i>

32:54.429 --> 33:00.399
<i>I was into her for a while.</i>

34:20.340 --> 34:22.440
Hey, Aunt Lily,
how are you?

34:22.443 --> 34:25.076
- Good! How are you?
- Good.

34:25.078 --> 34:27.344
Good! Were you at the church?
I didn't see you there.

34:27.346 --> 34:29.713
No, I just came right from work,
so I missed the church part.

34:29.715 --> 34:32.148
That's too bad.
It was wonderful.

34:32.150 --> 34:33.748
- Carol was so beautiful.
- Was she really?

34:33.751 --> 34:39.454
- Would you like something?
- I'm good. I'll see you later.

34:39.456 --> 34:43.024
- Good to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

34:52.400 --> 34:54.534
- Hello, hello!
- Danny!

34:54.536 --> 34:56.768
How you doin', Aunt Jules?

34:56.771 --> 35:00.105
- Nice to see you, Trevor.
- Danny.

35:00.107 --> 35:02.040
- Nice to see everybody.
- How was work?

35:02.042 --> 35:03.674
It was good. I'm sorry
I came right from work.

35:03.676 --> 35:05.242
- I missed the church.
- That's okay,

35:05.244 --> 35:06.710
We're just glad you're here.

35:06.712 --> 35:09.179
Aunt Lily said it was
beautiful though, yeah?

35:09.181 --> 35:11.247
- It was somethin'.
- Not a dry eye in the house.

35:11.249 --> 35:12.248
Nice.

35:12.250 --> 35:13.415
Really?

35:13.417 --> 35:15.216
Go say hi to Carol.

35:15.218 --> 35:17.351
Oh, she looks busy,
I'll get her later.

35:17.353 --> 35:20.620
You know, she brought a whole
lot of cute, single friends.

35:20.622 --> 35:23.155
Okay, Aunt Jules,
thank you very much.

35:23.157 --> 35:26.158
There are a lot of
cute, single girls here.

35:26.160 --> 35:28.260
Trevor's noticed them.

35:28.262 --> 35:31.796
Good observation.
I'm taken.

35:31.798 --> 35:33.697
- Right, honey?
- Yes.

35:33.699 --> 35:35.098
And you're too old
for any of them

35:35.100 --> 35:37.366
to be interested
in you anyway.

35:37.368 --> 35:39.668
Oh, so I'm monogamous
by default.

35:39.670 --> 35:41.703
By default, yeah.
You never know though.

35:41.705 --> 35:43.438
Sometimes they go
for the older guys, Mom.

35:43.440 --> 35:45.706
You'd better be careful.

35:53.548 --> 35:55.180
Danny, what are you
editing now?

35:55.182 --> 35:56.648
Oh, I mean,
just dumb shit.

35:56.650 --> 36:00.351
Commercials mostly, but now
I'm starting to get more films.

36:00.353 --> 36:04.221
My cousin was an orderly
on <i> General Hospital.</i>

36:04.223 --> 36:06.756
Oh, really, that's exactly
the same thing as a film editor.

36:06.758 --> 36:10.259
- What do you do?
- Uh, I, um...

36:10.261 --> 36:12.094
Investment counseling.

36:12.096 --> 36:15.697
- She had to tell you that?
- No, no, I do.

36:15.699 --> 36:17.699
I counsel people
on their investments.

36:17.701 --> 36:19.534
Yeah, that's great, man.
You like it?

36:19.536 --> 36:22.336
No, but I make
a shitload of money.

36:22.338 --> 36:23.804
Well, there you go.

36:23.806 --> 36:25.705
That's a good thing,
I guess.

36:25.707 --> 36:28.374
You just got a husband here
to dance with.

36:28.376 --> 36:32.211
I gotta get the ol'
ball and chain off my back.

36:32.213 --> 36:35.247
Already? Come on.
That was quick.

36:35.249 --> 36:36.281
Have fun.

36:37.549 --> 36:39.383
We'll dance together.

36:39.385 --> 36:42.619
You haven't always tried
new things.

36:42.621 --> 36:46.155
- I'm trying it, believe me.
- Awesome.

36:46.157 --> 36:47.456
You don't think of me
here anymore though.

36:47.458 --> 36:50.325
I know you don't.
You forget all about me.

36:50.327 --> 36:52.226
That's not true at all.

36:52.228 --> 36:53.827
You were always
my favorite cousin.

36:53.829 --> 36:56.129
- We just never see you anymore.
- No, I know.

36:56.131 --> 36:59.732
It's true, it's true.
I've sort of like cut off

36:59.734 --> 37:02.167
because you're the only one
I can talk to.

37:02.169 --> 37:05.503
The rest of these people here
I don't feel comfortable with.

37:05.505 --> 37:08.305
Well, I mean, you never
give people a chance.

37:08.307 --> 37:10.740
That's true, I don't,
but you know what it is?

37:10.742 --> 37:13.509
It's like I feel like everyone's
just trying to figure me out,

37:13.511 --> 37:15.777
put me in a box or something.

37:15.779 --> 37:18.913
Yeah. You know my friend Suze
was asking about you tonight.

37:18.915 --> 37:21.282
- Oh, Suze.
- She wanted to see you.

37:21.284 --> 37:23.284
- Really?
- Yeah.

37:23.286 --> 37:26.487
You can just enjoy your day,
you know what I mean?

37:26.489 --> 37:28.388
This is ridiculous!

37:28.390 --> 37:30.857
He's just unconventional
when it comes to relationships.

37:30.859 --> 37:32.692
That sounds like
code for gay.

37:32.694 --> 37:34.694
What, Danny?

37:34.696 --> 37:37.430
Are you kidding?
No way.

37:37.432 --> 37:39.465
That guy gets all the tail
he wants. I've seen.

37:39.467 --> 37:41.700
What have you seen?

37:41.702 --> 37:44.335
Well, like with that
hippie-dippie girl we met.

37:44.337 --> 37:45.703
Oh, Theresa.

37:45.705 --> 37:50.808
Exactly. What kind of
straight man has women friends?

37:50.810 --> 37:54.178
Why when someone
shows up solo

37:54.180 --> 37:56.346
that everybody thinks gay?

37:56.348 --> 37:59.615
I mean, if he was gay,
wouldn't he bring a guy?

37:59.617 --> 38:01.483
Not if he was
in the closet.

38:01.485 --> 38:02.817
Oh, why are you so concerned?

38:14.296 --> 38:15.862
- Hey, Charlie, how you doin'?
- Good. How you doin'?

38:15.864 --> 38:20.933
All right, I will.
I'll be over in a second.

38:20.935 --> 38:22.434
- Okay.
- Yeah.

38:23.936 --> 38:27.238
No, no, no, no.
I don't think you're gay.

38:27.240 --> 38:28.806
Yeah.

38:28.808 --> 38:33.944
because they've never
seen you with women.

38:33.946 --> 38:38.982
Right, because if you're alone,
that's not an option. I get it.

38:38.984 --> 38:43.353
I was alone for a long time
before I met your mother,

38:43.355 --> 38:44.587
and I loved it,

38:44.589 --> 38:48.625
but then I met her and...

38:48.627 --> 38:51.094
it was like, I really dug
hanging with her.

38:51.096 --> 38:52.562
Yeah.

38:52.564 --> 38:53.996
Yeah, she's a good lady.

38:53.998 --> 38:56.365
Yeah, yeah, she is.

38:56.367 --> 38:59.468
But you know,
once you get older,

38:59.470 --> 39:02.404
the body and the sex
and all that,

39:02.406 --> 39:04.706
it becomes less.

39:04.708 --> 39:08.910
I used to be really into
like tight bodies

39:08.912 --> 39:10.478
with pow-wow curves.

39:10.480 --> 39:15.349
but she has more of a roly-poly
kind of beautiful, you know?

39:15.351 --> 39:16.717
Right.

39:16.719 --> 39:19.386
Not to say that...

39:19.388 --> 39:23.656
not to say that the sex
is not fucking fantastic.

39:23.658 --> 39:24.990
- Okay.
- Yeah, no, I'm sorry.

39:24.992 --> 39:26.624
That's probably
not very appropriate.

39:26.626 --> 39:27.958
No, no, that's fine.

39:30.695 --> 39:34.764
It is great to be outside.

39:34.766 --> 39:36.899
Yeah, it's a beautiful night.

39:36.901 --> 39:38.500
No, no, man.

39:38.502 --> 39:40.768
I mean outside of convention.

39:41.770 --> 39:43.704
You know?

39:43.706 --> 39:46.440
I don't know.

39:46.442 --> 39:47.474
What?

39:47.476 --> 39:50.410
What? What?

39:50.412 --> 39:52.678
This fucking suit, man!

39:52.680 --> 39:55.113
- It's fucking terrible!
- Really?

39:55.115 --> 39:58.549
No, no, no!
But it's beautiful.

39:58.551 --> 40:01.552
It is beautifully terrible.

40:01.554 --> 40:06.690
It says, "I couldn't bother
being conforming to you,

40:06.692 --> 40:09.859
you conforming automatons."

40:09.861 --> 40:11.627
- No, it's noble, man.
- Really?

40:11.629 --> 40:14.529
Yes. It's noble.

40:14.531 --> 40:16.764
It's like...

40:16.766 --> 40:20.834
fucking nobility
from a time gone by.

40:20.836 --> 40:21.968
Don't ever stop.

40:21.970 --> 40:24.003
Wow. I don't think I can.

40:24.005 --> 40:26.105
Like Rilke says,
"You build your life

40:26.107 --> 40:30.876
in accordance
with that necessity."

40:34.447 --> 40:36.181
What's your necessity?

40:36.183 --> 40:37.916
I don't think I have one.

40:37.918 --> 40:39.651
Oh, come on!
Come on, come on, man!

40:39.653 --> 40:41.119
- What's your necessity?
- I don't know.

40:41.121 --> 40:42.687
I never really...

40:42.689 --> 40:47.691
Okay, like my necessity is to...

40:47.693 --> 40:49.559
do nothing.

40:49.561 --> 40:51.894
Like I wake up
in the morning

40:51.896 --> 40:56.098
and just let the day unfold.

40:56.100 --> 40:58.633
That's beautiful, man.
I fucking love that.

40:58.635 --> 41:01.636
See once you find
your necessity,

41:01.638 --> 41:05.539
it's all gravy
from there on out.

41:08.009 --> 41:10.977
Carla, where are you
right now?

41:10.979 --> 41:13.946
Why is your phone off,
first of all?

41:13.948 --> 41:15.948
Second of all,
I'm so high right now.

41:15.950 --> 41:18.717
I'm still at the wedding,
and my family is insane.

41:18.719 --> 41:20.518
I just got high
with my mom's boyfriend.

41:20.520 --> 41:22.052
You know what he told me?

41:22.054 --> 41:25.121
He told me that sex with
my mom is still fantastic.

41:25.123 --> 41:28.157
So I've got that image in
my head for the rest of my life.

41:29.994 --> 41:32.027
I so wanna talk to you
right now.

41:32.029 --> 41:36.698
I just feel like I'm at
that perfect high place,

41:36.700 --> 41:39.033
and I just need
to talk to you.

41:39.035 --> 41:40.968
I love talking to you high.

41:40.970 --> 41:43.070
It's one of my favorite
things to do.

41:43.072 --> 41:45.906
I need you right now.
Where are you?

41:45.908 --> 41:47.841
God!

41:47.843 --> 41:50.076
Call me back
as soon as you get this.

41:50.078 --> 41:51.710
Before you get this,
call me back.

41:51.712 --> 41:53.011
All right, love you, bye.

41:57.784 --> 42:00.618
- Uncle Bob, you takin' off?
- Yeah.

42:00.620 --> 42:02.486
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

42:02.488 --> 42:04.187
When are we gonna see you
getting married?

42:04.189 --> 42:06.689
Me? Oh, I don't know.
I'm too young.

42:06.691 --> 42:09.725
You better hurry up.
You don't wanna end up like me.

42:09.727 --> 42:12.027
Oh, come on!
That wouldn't so bad.

42:12.029 --> 42:14.062
You think?

42:14.064 --> 42:15.930
- Have a good night.
- You too.

42:48.128 --> 42:50.629
- Hey.

42:58.837 --> 43:00.704
- What happened?

43:02.306 --> 43:04.040
I don't know.
I have no idea, Danny.

43:09.012 --> 43:13.247
I mean, is she seeing
somebody else or what is it?

43:13.249 --> 43:14.915
She wouldn't say.

43:14.917 --> 43:17.651
Oh, God.

43:17.653 --> 43:19.653
It's impossible.

43:21.088 --> 43:24.223
I really... I don't know
how anybody does it.

43:26.726 --> 43:30.829
Well, you're asking
the wrong guy.

43:30.831 --> 43:33.164
You are so lucky you don't
have to deal with this shit.

43:33.166 --> 43:35.232
No.
I don't know about that.

43:37.268 --> 43:38.301
Do you have any weed?

43:40.270 --> 43:42.571
I think I might
have some weed.

43:42.573 --> 43:45.006
Look at who you're
talking to right now.

43:45.008 --> 43:47.341
- Can I have some?
- Do you want some?

43:47.343 --> 43:48.842
- Yeah, I want weed.
- I'm getting you weed.

43:48.844 --> 43:51.611
Gonna make it all better.

43:51.613 --> 43:53.679
I want wine and weed.

43:53.681 --> 43:56.648
I'll do what I can here.
I don't know how much...

43:56.650 --> 43:58.249
I don't know how much
weed and wine we have,

43:58.251 --> 43:59.350
but I'll do my best.

43:59.352 --> 44:01.685
- Pills.
- Pills? Heroin?

44:01.687 --> 44:03.119
- Heroin.
- All right.

44:03.121 --> 44:05.020
So let's start you off
with weed.

44:05.022 --> 44:08.156
I'm gonna get you wine.
How is cheap red wine for you?

44:08.158 --> 44:09.290
It's fine.

44:35.917 --> 44:38.818
This is really good weed.
Where'd you get it?

44:38.820 --> 44:41.220
I got it from
my tai chi instructor.

44:45.958 --> 44:47.091
Oh, my God.

44:48.961 --> 44:50.860
You have a tai chi instructor?

44:50.862 --> 44:53.963
You don't?

44:53.965 --> 44:56.098
Oh, my God, what are you?

44:56.100 --> 44:57.933
Like an 85-year-old Asian man?

44:57.935 --> 45:00.001
I am, in the body of...

45:00.003 --> 45:02.770
You're very well maintained.

45:02.772 --> 45:05.139
You never know what it's like
inside the relationship

45:05.141 --> 45:07.241
That's so true.

45:07.243 --> 45:11.044
Well, it was fun.
It used to be fun.

45:11.046 --> 45:13.780
How long has it
not been fun for?

45:16.251 --> 45:18.150
I don't know.

45:23.989 --> 45:25.923
Are you okay?

45:30.427 --> 45:31.693
Hey.

45:50.445 --> 45:53.013
Hey, come here.

46:02.923 --> 46:04.890
You're gonna be okay.

46:04.892 --> 46:07.759
Really?

46:07.761 --> 46:10.695
Really.

46:10.697 --> 46:13.764
How do you know?

46:13.766 --> 46:15.898
I can feel it.

46:19.002 --> 46:21.036
I know these things.

46:25.841 --> 46:27.308
I do.

46:27.310 --> 46:31.245
You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna go for a walk.

46:31.247 --> 46:34.348
You're gonna be fine. Come on.
I have a good plan for us.

46:34.350 --> 46:36.116
- You do?
- Yeah.

46:56.234 --> 46:58.468
- Can you do it?
- Yeah, I can do it.

46:58.470 --> 47:01.304
- Can you see?
- It's a meadow!

47:01.306 --> 47:03.739
- What is it?
- It's a whole meadow!

47:47.316 --> 47:50.384
- Are we in the right space?
- Yeah. Straight.

47:50.386 --> 47:52.552
What street is this?

47:52.554 --> 47:54.854
Suffolk.

47:54.856 --> 47:56.355
We're not there yet.
We're almost there.

47:58.492 --> 48:00.258
- What is your name?
- I'm Megan.

48:00.260 --> 48:02.326
- Hey, I'm Danny.
- Hi, Danny, nice to meet you.

48:02.328 --> 48:04.895
- This is Carla.
- Hi, how are you?

48:04.897 --> 48:07.464
- Yeah, good. How are you doing?
- Good. It's good.

48:07.466 --> 48:09.199
Tequila?

48:16.907 --> 48:19.341
- Where are you from?
- I'm from Ireland, from Dublin.

48:19.343 --> 48:22.277
- Do you like it?
- I love it here.

48:22.279 --> 48:26.314
- Do you live in the city?
- Well, I don't know now.

48:26.316 --> 48:28.282
I'm sort of homeless
as of tonight.

48:28.284 --> 48:30.150
- You gotta drown your sorrows.
- Yeah!

48:30.152 --> 48:33.920
She's like
an Irish Brigette Bardot.

48:33.922 --> 48:35.821
- You should have one more shot.
- Really? You think?

48:35.823 --> 48:37.489
Have you got to work tomorrow?

48:37.491 --> 48:39.991
How can you say no
to that accent?

48:39.993 --> 48:42.560
No, I can't
say no to that accent.

48:42.562 --> 48:45.129
Here's to New York.
Come on.

48:45.131 --> 48:47.264
It's a good tequila.
I wouldn't give you bad tequila.

48:47.266 --> 48:48.832
I already can't feel my teeth.

48:48.834 --> 48:50.567
You got the basic stuff.

48:50.569 --> 48:53.436
You haven't met that guy
or that girl, right?

48:53.438 --> 48:57.440
Yeah, exactly.
I haven't met that person.

48:57.442 --> 49:01.143
You never know. You come into
a bar and meet a guy or girl.

49:01.145 --> 49:03.612
Completely depends.

49:03.614 --> 49:08.249
And that's a good way to be
because you double your odds.

49:08.251 --> 49:10.317
No, I've never dated
a customer.

49:10.319 --> 49:13.053
Thanks for answering that.

49:13.055 --> 49:15.055
I'm not doing a number slide.
I'm just asking!

49:15.057 --> 49:16.990
I'm gonna get a number slide!

49:16.992 --> 49:18.891
I want you to be happy.
This is your night.

49:18.893 --> 49:21.426
I don't even know
what's going on with her.

49:21.428 --> 49:26.097
and she wouldn't tell me
if she was with someone else.

49:26.099 --> 49:28.432
When you ask someone,
"Are you with someone,

49:28.434 --> 49:30.467
"are you seeing someone else,
have you met someone else?"

49:30.469 --> 49:33.303
and they don't
answer that question...

49:33.305 --> 49:37.006
Right, but I mean, you don't
ask that question unless like...

49:37.008 --> 49:39.608
- What did you... What?
- Let's stop talking about it.

49:39.610 --> 49:41.977
But she's also--
Where are you going?

49:41.979 --> 49:47.716
I dropped my napkin,
you fucking pervert!

49:47.718 --> 49:50.351
- This is your life, right?
- No, I know.

49:50.353 --> 49:52.619
Do you want something
that's extraordinary

49:52.621 --> 49:57.123
Or something that's like...

49:57.125 --> 49:59.625
- No, I want that.
- Yeah, exactly.

49:59.627 --> 50:02.594
- Sorry, if I spat on you.
- No, I just wanna hug you.

50:02.596 --> 50:04.729
I just wanna hug you.

50:04.731 --> 50:07.064
- She's doing her thing.
- What are you saying?

50:07.066 --> 50:12.769
- Then you go like this.
- I don't need the criticism.

50:12.771 --> 50:14.470
We should really...

50:14.472 --> 50:17.139
We should go?

50:17.141 --> 50:18.673
But I tried to get that
out of her.

50:18.675 --> 50:20.374
Did you see how I tried
to get that out of her?

50:20.376 --> 50:22.676
- Yeah.
- Did you try?

50:22.678 --> 50:27.547
I feel like there's a level
that we're so close,

50:27.549 --> 50:29.649
and we're like
really good friends,

50:29.651 --> 50:31.550
but I get to a certain level,
and then it's like,

50:31.552 --> 50:34.786
boom, door goes up.

50:34.788 --> 50:39.457
Like, it's like
"That's as far as you get."

50:39.459 --> 50:43.093
- You wanna get a bit further.
- No, no, no!

50:43.095 --> 50:44.694
You joke about it
and you make jokes,

50:44.696 --> 50:47.596
but like I really
feel that sometimes.

50:49.298 --> 50:51.465
I'm just being honest.
I'm just being honest.

50:51.467 --> 50:54.568
You know, you can trust me.

50:54.570 --> 50:57.237
Like I don't know why you feel
like you can't trust me.

50:57.239 --> 50:59.172
Why are you taking
all the drinks?

50:59.174 --> 51:01.674
It's like you get it,
like you fucking get it,

51:01.676 --> 51:03.409
and you don't even know
that you get it.

51:03.411 --> 51:05.411
Like you're just like so cool,

51:05.413 --> 51:07.312
and you're
a fucking great woman,

51:07.314 --> 51:11.816
and you seek these relationships
where if you're not appreciated,

51:15.487 --> 51:17.354
No, I was crazy in college.

51:17.356 --> 51:21.391
and I would fuck these women
that I had no connection to.

51:21.393 --> 51:23.226
Oh, my God,
that's so unusual!

51:23.228 --> 51:25.561
Wait, in college, you got
really drunk all the time

51:25.563 --> 51:27.829
- and fucked women?
- Isn't that crazy?

51:27.831 --> 51:32.366
So you were that one
that did that in college.

51:32.368 --> 51:34.735
- You were the one guy...
- That did that.

51:34.737 --> 51:36.236
No, I'm not saying
I was a one guy.

51:36.238 --> 51:37.403
I'm just trying
to make a point.

51:37.405 --> 51:39.071
I'm saying that I did that

51:39.073 --> 51:41.106
with these girls
that I would be attracted to,

51:41.108 --> 51:43.475
but then I also had these
really good girlfriends

51:43.477 --> 51:45.143
that we would
stay up all night

51:45.145 --> 51:47.211
and talk and bond
and everything,

51:47.213 --> 51:49.379
but I would never even think
about sleeping with those girls.

51:49.381 --> 51:52.482
It was like I wanted to keep
those two things separate.

51:52.484 --> 51:54.684
Right, right,
but did those chicks,

51:54.686 --> 51:58.688
the ones that would stay up
braiding your hair every night...

51:58.690 --> 52:01.624
- You are such a bitch.
- Did they wanna have...

52:01.626 --> 52:03.859
Did they wanna
have sex with you?

52:03.861 --> 52:05.694
No, because I had
braided hair at that point.

52:05.696 --> 52:07.162
Why would they wanna
have sex with me?

52:07.164 --> 52:09.164
No, that was not
part of our thing.

52:09.166 --> 52:11.166
They totally wanted
to have sex with you.

52:11.168 --> 52:18.373
And they were like, "When is he
going to make a move?

52:18.375 --> 52:23.177
How long do I have to talk about
feelings with this fucking guy?"

52:23.179 --> 52:25.145
Really? They were waiting
for me to make a move?

52:25.147 --> 52:28.748
I hope they weren't.
I thought we were bonding.

52:28.750 --> 52:31.484
You couldn't
handle the intimacy

52:31.486 --> 52:33.886
like full-on altogether.

52:33.888 --> 52:36.521
You could either have
sexual intimacy,

52:36.523 --> 52:39.357
which wasn't really intimacy;
it was just banging.

52:39.359 --> 52:42.560
- It was banging.
- Or intimacy without the sex.

52:42.562 --> 52:44.762
You weren't ready
for the whole shebang.

52:44.764 --> 52:47.397
I get it. You're really
not there even now.

52:47.399 --> 52:48.731
That's what I'm saying.

52:48.733 --> 52:51.200
I have not made
that much progress.

52:51.202 --> 52:53.769
Did she call?

52:53.771 --> 52:55.771
I have not
looked at my phone.

52:55.773 --> 52:58.240
Good.
Don't.

52:58.242 --> 53:00.742
Yeah.

53:00.744 --> 53:03.677
I don't want to.

53:07.248 --> 53:10.216
Thank you so much
for tonight.

53:10.218 --> 53:13.252
Of course, it was fun.
I had a good time.

53:15.555 --> 53:18.223
Do you have
everything you need?

53:18.225 --> 53:21.226
- Glass of water, anything?
- No. I'm good.

53:21.228 --> 53:23.494
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to sleep.

53:23.496 --> 53:25.596
- Where?
- On the couch.

53:25.598 --> 53:27.864
You should
get in here with me.

53:27.866 --> 53:30.199
There's plenty of room.
Look.

53:30.201 --> 53:32.367
No, it's all right.

53:32.369 --> 53:34.268
- What's your problem?
- Couch is comfortable

53:34.270 --> 53:36.570
I don't know.
You wanna share the bed?

53:36.572 --> 53:39.573
This is stupid.
It'll be fun.

53:39.575 --> 53:41.541
I don't wanna sleep alone.

53:41.543 --> 53:43.543
All right.
I'm good with it.

53:45.646 --> 53:48.247
I can't really sleep
in these, but...

53:48.249 --> 53:50.916
- Can you turn around?
- Are you kidding me?

53:50.918 --> 53:55.954
so I just feel a little awkward,
and I don't like these boxers.

53:55.956 --> 53:58.756
But I've seen you
in swimming trunks before.

53:58.758 --> 54:00.457
But I don't like
these boxers.

54:00.459 --> 54:01.791
Just...

54:01.793 --> 54:04.193
turn around for two seconds!

54:04.195 --> 54:05.594
This is ridiculous.

54:05.596 --> 54:07.829
Oh, just shut the fuck up
and turn around.

54:07.831 --> 54:09.630
- One.
- Wait a second.

54:09.632 --> 54:11.531
- Two.
- No, no, I meant...

54:11.533 --> 54:14.634
Two and a half.
I saw your boxers!

54:14.636 --> 54:16.235
They're horrible, aren't they?

54:16.237 --> 54:18.971
- No, I didn't see them.
- I have no idea.

54:18.973 --> 54:20.572
You're shy, huh?

54:20.574 --> 54:22.740
I'm a little shy.

54:22.742 --> 54:25.576
We've never been
in bed together.

54:25.578 --> 54:27.811
- It's the first time.
- Oh, my God!

54:27.813 --> 54:31.581
Is this what you do
usually in bed?

54:31.583 --> 54:33.749
Face the person
and talk to them?

54:35.452 --> 54:38.419
Yeah. Can we kill the lamp?

54:38.421 --> 54:40.754
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.

54:40.756 --> 54:42.922
- Sorry. I gotta reach over you.
- So fuckin' rude.

54:42.924 --> 54:45.858
I can't believe
I just did that.

54:45.860 --> 54:47.593
Are you tired?

54:47.595 --> 54:50.295
I'm a little tired, but...

54:50.297 --> 54:51.863
You wanna talk at all?
I'm not tired at all.

54:51.865 --> 54:53.965
A little chitchat?
Yeah, you seem wired up.

54:55.500 --> 54:57.868
What's up with Theresa?

54:57.870 --> 55:01.504
I don't know. I'm not really
talking to her right now.

55:01.506 --> 55:04.240
Huh? Why?

55:05.675 --> 55:06.941
Just haven't.

55:06.943 --> 55:08.943
Not into her anymore?

55:08.945 --> 55:11.245
No, I'm into her, I mean...

55:14.749 --> 55:17.283
I don't know.

55:17.285 --> 55:18.917
I guess I'm into her.
I don't know.

55:20.686 --> 55:24.655
I guess I was kind of like
into her in a way

55:24.657 --> 55:28.425
unconventional
relationship thing.

55:28.427 --> 55:32.328
Like the open relationship
thing seems interesting to me.

55:32.330 --> 55:34.596
Yeah, because you're a weirdo.

55:34.598 --> 55:36.998
Is that really weird?

55:37.000 --> 55:39.567
I thought it was progressive
and open minded.

55:39.569 --> 55:41.702
Uh-huh.

55:41.704 --> 55:43.570
I just feel like there's
gotta be something else

55:43.572 --> 55:44.837
that doesn't feel
so oppressive,

55:44.839 --> 55:46.872
like I'm totally
losing my freedom

55:46.874 --> 55:50.842
and any sense
of identity I have.

55:50.844 --> 55:53.945
Yeah, but relationships
don't have to be oppressive.

55:53.947 --> 55:56.747
Like it can be
what you want it to be,

55:56.749 --> 56:00.016
you know,
like with me and Emmy.

56:00.018 --> 56:02.818
Okay, that's not
the best example right now,

56:02.820 --> 56:07.389
but still, you make it
what you want it to be,

56:07.391 --> 56:11.526
what suits you and your partner,
do you know what I mean?

56:11.528 --> 56:13.628
You know, if you're
starting to feel,

56:13.630 --> 56:16.731
if you actually
take it that far,

56:16.733 --> 56:19.900
you can actually just say
to that person,

56:19.902 --> 56:23.336
"Hey, you know, I need
a little space here."

56:23.338 --> 56:26.072
I just feel like you never
let it get to that point.

56:26.074 --> 56:27.706
- You know?
- No, you're right.

56:27.708 --> 56:29.441
You decide that
it's gonna be oppressive

56:29.443 --> 56:33.311
before you've even
tried it out.

56:33.313 --> 56:35.880
And I guess I haven't really
been in a situation lately

56:35.882 --> 56:38.349
where I thought that,
you know,

56:38.351 --> 56:42.453
the person was worth like
making the sacrifices for.

56:42.455 --> 56:43.821
Yeah.

56:44.889 --> 56:47.457
Yeah, it's rare.

56:47.459 --> 56:50.626
I don't know.

56:50.628 --> 56:52.661
I'm kinda getting tired.

56:52.663 --> 56:54.929
You wanna go to sleep?

56:54.931 --> 56:58.599
Yeah.
I'm kinda fading.

56:58.601 --> 57:00.534
Okay.

57:04.805 --> 57:06.605
I'll see you
in the morning then.

57:06.607 --> 57:08.607
Thank you for tonight.

57:08.609 --> 57:09.908
Of course.

57:14.413 --> 57:16.113
It's fun here.

57:18.549 --> 57:20.616
Nice to have you.

57:20.618 --> 57:23.852
It feels like there's
a blanket folded up

57:23.854 --> 57:26.955
inside the pillowcase.

57:26.957 --> 57:29.090
Man pillows.

57:35.797 --> 57:39.499
What?
No.

57:39.501 --> 57:42.101
No, I'm not doing this
right now.

57:42.103 --> 57:44.536
He's on the couch.
I'm in the bed.

57:44.538 --> 57:47.438
What?

57:47.440 --> 57:49.039
Yeah.

57:49.041 --> 57:51.641
Yeah.

57:51.643 --> 57:52.775
You too.

57:58.713 --> 58:00.413
You okay?

58:02.649 --> 58:04.483
Yeah, I'm fine.

58:07.887 --> 58:10.787
What'd she say?

58:10.789 --> 58:12.655
I don't wanna talk about it.

58:22.031 --> 58:24.165
Why are you being
so nice to me?

58:24.167 --> 58:27.836
What do you mean,
why am I being so nice to you?

58:27.838 --> 58:30.271
I care about you,
that's why.

58:39.214 --> 58:42.715
Don't be sorry.
Don't be sorry.

58:42.717 --> 58:44.116
It's okay.

58:49.955 --> 58:51.622
It's okay.

01:00:38.688 --> 01:00:41.623
Ready.

01:00:41.625 --> 01:00:43.958
Ohh.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.859
Step.

01:00:45.861 --> 01:00:47.760
Chi.

01:00:47.762 --> 01:00:50.763
Ahh.

01:00:50.765 --> 01:00:54.199
Chi.

01:00:54.201 --> 01:00:56.334
Ohh.

01:00:56.336 --> 01:01:00.671
Chi.

01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:03.673
Around.

01:01:03.675 --> 01:01:05.808
Hold.

01:01:05.810 --> 01:01:07.109
Chi.

01:01:07.111 --> 01:01:08.410
Half step.

01:01:08.412 --> 01:01:11.946
Ahh.

01:01:11.948 --> 01:01:15.682
Chi.

01:01:17.818 --> 01:01:20.052
Ahh.

01:01:20.054 --> 01:01:23.722
Haven't seen you in class
in a while.

01:01:23.724 --> 01:01:25.757
What?

01:01:25.759 --> 01:01:27.959
I'm starting to think the only
reason you come to class

01:01:27.961 --> 01:01:30.061
is when you need some weed.

01:01:30.063 --> 01:01:34.298
I come for the practice.
The weed is the added bonus.

01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:35.899
You know that.

01:01:37.935 --> 01:01:39.268
Namaste, my friend.

01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:42.204
- I'll see ya next week.
- All right.

01:03:57.102 --> 01:03:59.470
Because, Mom,
I have like 80 cousins.

01:03:59.472 --> 01:04:02.039
They all eventually get married.
I'm not going to every wedding.

01:04:02.041 --> 01:04:04.174
I'm doing her a favor.

01:04:04.176 --> 01:04:06.042
She only invited me
out of obligation.

01:04:06.044 --> 01:04:07.843
You know how expensive it is
per person?

01:04:07.845 --> 01:04:10.478
They're gonna be psyched
that I don't go.

01:04:12.815 --> 01:04:15.115
Because!

01:04:15.117 --> 01:04:19.219
All right, Mom, listen, my ear
is killing me from the phone.

01:04:19.221 --> 01:04:21.554
I do have a hands-free device.
I just didn't bring it with me.

01:04:21.556 --> 01:04:25.524
I'm going! I have to go.
I love you too.

01:04:25.526 --> 01:04:28.293
Okay, okay,
I'm hanging up now.

01:04:28.295 --> 01:04:30.161
All right, I gotta go.

01:04:30.163 --> 01:04:32.830
All right, I'll see you.

01:04:32.832 --> 01:04:35.966
Oh, my God, Em!
How are you?

01:04:35.968 --> 01:04:37.400
- Good. How are you?
- Good to see you!

01:04:37.402 --> 01:04:39.135
How have you been?
Where have you been?

01:04:39.137 --> 01:04:42.571
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's just been crazy.

01:04:42.573 --> 01:04:45.407
She's good, yeah.
What's up with that?

01:04:45.409 --> 01:04:48.576
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know, a fight?

01:04:48.578 --> 01:04:51.211
Oh, no, no, no.
I've just been crazy.

01:04:51.213 --> 01:04:53.279
How's the documentary?
Are we going to Sundance?

01:04:53.281 --> 01:04:56.615
It's kind of my
forever project, you know.

01:04:56.617 --> 01:04:59.217
Don't wait too long.
Sorry.

01:04:59.219 --> 01:05:01.385
Okay, I better go, but you're
gonna vote tomorrow, right?

01:05:01.387 --> 01:05:06.890
Only for you because I usually
come out for the big ones.

01:05:06.892 --> 01:05:09.125
- They're all the big ones!
- I know, I know!

01:05:09.127 --> 01:05:10.626
Vote on
the Working Families Party.

01:05:10.628 --> 01:05:13.028
- I will, whatever that means.
- Okay.

01:05:13.030 --> 01:05:14.963
I gotta go.
And come to our night.

01:05:14.965 --> 01:05:16.965
We're gonna be at
the Soho House on Crosby.

01:05:16.967 --> 01:05:19.200
- Okay, I'll try, yeah.
- Hopefully a celebration,

01:05:19.202 --> 01:05:24.071
- Carla wants to see you.
- Okay. Tell her I said hi.

01:05:24.073 --> 01:05:25.505
- Okay, bye.
- All right.

01:05:41.121 --> 01:05:43.488
Hey. Hey, it's me.

01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:47.391
Hello!

01:05:47.393 --> 01:05:49.159
Oh, my God,
I'm so glad to be...

01:05:49.161 --> 01:05:50.260
Hi.

01:05:50.262 --> 01:05:52.395
...here with all you guys.

01:05:52.397 --> 01:05:54.563
- What's happening?
- You guys know each other?

01:05:54.565 --> 01:05:57.032
Yes. Yeah, how are you?

01:05:57.034 --> 01:05:58.466
- From dance class.
- Oh, yeah.

01:05:58.468 --> 01:06:01.101
- Yeah, how's it going?
- Good, good.

01:06:01.103 --> 01:06:03.136
What are you kids up to?

01:06:03.138 --> 01:06:06.172
- Just being.
- Yeah.

01:06:06.174 --> 01:06:07.940
Just being. Nice.
That's nice.

01:06:07.942 --> 01:06:09.508
It is nice.

01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:11.910
It feels you guys
are just being in here.

01:06:11.912 --> 01:06:14.479
- We missed you at class today.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:06:14.481 --> 01:06:17.482
- 'Cause I couldn't make it.
- It was amazing.

01:06:17.484 --> 01:06:20.451
Yeah, it always is with
this guy. He's awesome.

01:06:20.453 --> 01:06:21.518
I love your class.

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:25.421
This is really great.
You guys should know each other

01:06:25.423 --> 01:06:30.459
Yeah, I feel like
there's a good thing, yeah.

01:06:30.461 --> 01:06:31.993
- All good.
- It's all good.

01:06:31.995 --> 01:06:33.928
It's all love.

01:06:33.930 --> 01:06:34.929
It is?

01:06:34.931 --> 01:06:36.697
Sit, Danny, sit.

01:06:36.699 --> 01:06:40.534
Oh, no, I was just on my way
around the block,

01:06:40.536 --> 01:06:42.402
and I thought of you,

01:06:42.404 --> 01:06:45.071
and I didn't know
this was happening,

01:06:45.073 --> 01:06:46.405
so you guys should
just do your thing.

01:06:46.407 --> 01:06:49.207
- It's not our thing.
- No.

01:06:49.209 --> 01:06:51.042
It's <i>our</i> thing.

01:06:51.044 --> 01:06:52.977
- Yeah, you're included.
- I'm included?

01:06:52.979 --> 01:06:54.545
- You are.
- Sure.

01:06:54.547 --> 01:06:56.246
That's so nice.

01:06:56.248 --> 01:06:58.281
What am I included in,
exactly?

01:06:58.283 --> 01:07:00.216
- Not sure what's going on.
- In the love.

01:07:00.218 --> 01:07:02.985
I don't know if I'm in the
same vibe as you guys, though.

01:07:02.987 --> 01:07:04.419
- That's okay.
- Well, get into it.

01:07:04.421 --> 01:07:06.421
Come on, sit down.

01:07:06.423 --> 01:07:08.156
No, I really don't
wanna sit right now.

01:07:08.158 --> 01:07:09.257
I'm kinda amped up, so...

01:07:09.259 --> 01:07:14.128
You don't have to do the
whole alpha dog thing here.

01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:18.966
It's not like I'm gonna
steal her away from you.

01:07:18.968 --> 01:07:22.369
She's not mine to steal.
We're just friends.

01:07:22.371 --> 01:07:24.037
I just have some stuff
going on.

01:07:24.039 --> 01:07:25.171
I'm good, I'm good.

01:07:25.173 --> 01:07:26.572
- Hey.
- What?

01:07:26.574 --> 01:07:29.207
Can I just hug you?

01:07:29.209 --> 01:07:31.442
I really don't want a hug
right now, all right?

01:07:31.444 --> 01:07:33.377
- Okay.
- Sorry.

01:07:33.379 --> 01:07:36.279
Maybe we'll talk later
or something, but you know...

01:07:36.281 --> 01:07:38.147
Have a good day, dude.

01:07:38.149 --> 01:07:40.182
Okay, take it easy, guy.

01:07:40.184 --> 01:07:42.484
Take it easy, guy.

01:07:42.486 --> 01:07:44.586
That's awesome.
This guy's awesome.

01:07:44.588 --> 01:07:46.287
- He is awesome.
- He is, yeah.

01:07:46.289 --> 01:07:48.122
Is this like for real?

01:07:48.124 --> 01:07:50.357
Or is this just like
an act you put on or like...

01:07:50.359 --> 01:07:52.726
What's going on?

01:07:52.728 --> 01:07:55.261
I don't really
understand the question.

01:07:55.263 --> 01:07:59.765
you got your shirt off
in November, like, all love,

01:07:59.767 --> 01:08:01.666
is that really who you are?

01:08:01.668 --> 01:08:03.200
What's happening?

01:08:03.202 --> 01:08:07.537
No. Don't put a shirt on.
Just be whoever you are.

01:08:07.539 --> 01:08:13.009
Do you really believe
all that shit, man?

01:08:13.011 --> 01:08:17.212
Like the shit you teach
and all that, you know.

01:08:17.215 --> 01:08:19.381
It's not a matter of belief.

01:08:19.383 --> 01:08:21.683
It's a matter of knowing.

01:08:21.685 --> 01:08:29.256
I hear you, and you're right.
Your truth is not my truth.

01:08:29.259 --> 01:08:31.626
Totally, yeah, thank God.

01:08:31.627 --> 01:08:33.461
I'm gonna go,
I'm gonna go.

01:08:33.462 --> 01:08:34.761
Don't.
Nothing's happening,

01:08:34.764 --> 01:08:36.796
We had an amazing class,

01:08:36.799 --> 01:08:38.564
and then Jarrod wanted
to borrow a book,

01:08:38.567 --> 01:08:40.767
so that's all
that's going on.

01:08:40.769 --> 01:08:43.269
That's nice, yeah.
What book?

01:08:43.270 --> 01:08:45.337
- Good book?
- Yeah.

01:08:45.339 --> 01:08:49.307
- He looks like a big reader.
- What's up?

01:08:49.309 --> 01:08:51.676
Nothing's up! I just thought
we were gonna hang out like--

01:08:51.678 --> 01:08:54.679
and you don't have to
explain yourself to me.

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:57.581
I didn't realize
what I was coming into.

01:08:57.582 --> 01:09:01.518
and I want you
to be able to let that go.

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:03.720
No, I just wanna
let you guys just be

01:09:03.721 --> 01:09:05.388
'cause that's
what you're doing.

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:07.256
Hang on, take a step back.

01:09:07.258 --> 01:09:09.524
Look at this fucking guy.

01:09:09.526 --> 01:09:12.493
I think we should
just ask ourselves

01:09:12.495 --> 01:09:15.796
What do you mean,
what's really happening?

01:09:15.798 --> 01:09:17.264
You want me to tell you
what's really happening?

01:09:17.265 --> 01:09:19.499
- Yeah.
- You're here,

01:09:19.501 --> 01:09:21.267
you got the no shirt on
in November,

01:09:21.269 --> 01:09:24.069
she's a fuckin' beautiful woman,
and you wanna fuck her,

01:09:24.071 --> 01:09:26.304
but you're using
the spiritual thing as like...

01:09:26.305 --> 01:09:28.471
- Hey, hey.
- No, I'm just saying.

01:09:28.474 --> 01:09:30.607
He said he wants to be real
like I'm being real.

01:09:30.609 --> 01:09:32.341
But you're not gonna
admit that.

01:09:32.344 --> 01:09:33.810
You're gonna say,
"It's all love,

01:09:33.812 --> 01:09:35.444
and it's about
the connection, man."

01:09:35.446 --> 01:09:37.446
Okay, look,
you don't know me, man.

01:09:37.448 --> 01:09:41.817
Sex is one emotion
on a much larger compass.

01:09:44.154 --> 01:09:45.752
Do you have like spiritual
Tourette's or something?

01:09:45.755 --> 01:09:48.354
What are these platitudes?

01:09:48.357 --> 01:09:49.689
I'm gonna go.
This is so weird.

01:09:49.691 --> 01:09:52.158
I feel like
really weird right now.

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:54.527
- Don't go like this, Danny.
- We'll talk later.

01:09:54.529 --> 01:09:56.729
You should have told me
you had shit going on.

01:09:56.731 --> 01:09:58.864
- No, no, no.
- Danny, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:09:58.866 --> 01:10:02.868
Don't walk out with this,
this anger on you.

01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:06.805
Can you just adjust your
expectation and be with us?

01:10:06.807 --> 01:10:09.541
I feel like I'm doing that
all the time when I'm with you.

01:10:09.543 --> 01:10:13.344
that we were gonna just have
a one-on-one thing,

01:10:13.346 --> 01:10:15.579
and there's sometimes
always a party here,

01:10:15.581 --> 01:10:18.248
and I just wasn't ready for it,
you know what I mean?

01:10:18.250 --> 01:10:19.315
Okay.

01:10:19.317 --> 01:10:21.350
And I love who you are,

01:10:21.352 --> 01:10:23.485
and I want you
to be who you are,

01:10:23.487 --> 01:10:26.688
but it's just hard
for me sometimes

01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:30.157
'cause I wanna have you in a way
that I know I can't have you.

01:10:33.695 --> 01:10:37.397
But you're great,
and I'm grateful for you.

01:10:37.399 --> 01:10:39.465
So I just need to go
right now.

01:10:39.467 --> 01:10:40.899
- Okay.
- All right?

01:10:40.901 --> 01:10:42.300
All right.

01:10:44.403 --> 01:10:46.871
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:49.807
Be well.

01:11:00.351 --> 01:11:02.552
<i>Do you ever have times</i>

01:11:02.554 --> 01:11:05.988
<i>where you do feel</i>
<i>jealous or angry?</i>

01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:07.956
<i>Yeah, I feel</i>
<i>those things,</i>

01:11:07.958 --> 01:11:09.691
<i>but I know that</i>
<i>they're not real</i>

01:11:09.693 --> 01:11:11.993
<i>and that you...</i>

01:11:11.995 --> 01:11:14.862
<i>They're just,</i>
<i>they're just ego,</i>

01:11:14.864 --> 01:11:18.265
<i>and you have to...</i>

01:11:18.267 --> 01:11:21.034
<i>breathe and come back</i>
<i>to yourself.</i>

01:11:58.668 --> 01:12:01.002
Oh, I'll be right back.

01:12:01.004 --> 01:12:03.637
If you were smart,
you'd use Grand Marnier.

01:12:03.639 --> 01:12:05.572
- Hi!
- How are you?

01:12:05.574 --> 01:12:07.874
- Good. How are you?
- Good to see you.

01:12:07.876 --> 01:12:10.743
Thank you.
Come meet these guys.

01:12:10.745 --> 01:12:12.745
This is Danny.

01:12:12.747 --> 01:12:14.680
I want to introduce you
to Danny.

01:12:14.682 --> 01:12:16.581
Oh, good to see you!
What's going on?

01:12:16.583 --> 01:12:18.316
Nice to see you.
Congratulations.

01:12:19.951 --> 01:12:22.719
We're just discussing really
important political matters here

01:12:22.721 --> 01:12:24.887
like how to make
a good margarita.

01:12:24.889 --> 01:12:26.722
That's important.

01:12:26.724 --> 01:12:30.392
That's how we're
gonna win this thing!

01:12:30.394 --> 01:12:31.993
Guys, I'm gonna
check in with you later.

01:12:31.995 --> 01:12:33.794
I'm gonna show
this gentleman around.

01:12:33.796 --> 01:12:35.829
Of course.

01:12:35.831 --> 01:12:38.531
Good to meet you guys.
Nice to meet you.

01:12:38.533 --> 01:12:40.699
All right.
Have a good time.

01:12:42.968 --> 01:12:46.670
Yeah.
That guy's a real asshole.

01:12:46.672 --> 01:12:48.405
Sit over there.
I'll come find you guys later.

01:12:48.407 --> 01:12:50.340
- Oh, right.
- His way.

01:12:50.342 --> 01:12:51.774
No, that's all
it comes from.

01:12:51.776 --> 01:12:55.811
What are you doing here?
You wanna sit down?

01:12:55.813 --> 01:12:59.548
It's good to see you.
How are you?

01:12:59.550 --> 01:13:02.384
I'm gonna take my coat off,
all right?

01:13:02.386 --> 01:13:04.386
Can I have a sip
of your beer?

01:13:04.388 --> 01:13:05.920
Yeah, of course.

01:13:11.492 --> 01:13:13.059
How you doin'?

01:13:13.061 --> 01:13:14.660
Good.

01:13:14.662 --> 01:13:18.430
It's been a while.

01:13:18.432 --> 01:13:19.497
Are you drunk?

01:13:19.499 --> 01:13:20.965
I miss you, Danny.

01:13:22.434 --> 01:13:24.701
It's so good of you to come.

01:13:24.703 --> 01:13:28.638
I mean not yeah.
You know what I mean.

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:29.939
Shut up!

01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:33.975
No, no, I'm not drunk.

01:13:33.977 --> 01:13:37.111
It's a good party.

01:13:37.113 --> 01:13:38.946
It is!

01:13:38.948 --> 01:13:42.516
It's a dumb party,
but it's fun.

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.019
- Oh, my God.
- What?

01:13:46.021 --> 01:13:48.388
I love this fucking song.
Will you dance?

01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:49.856
You're gonna dance with me.

01:13:49.858 --> 01:13:51.891
You're gonna dance with me
right now!

01:13:51.893 --> 01:13:54.927
I just got here.
Let me have a little drink.

01:13:54.929 --> 01:13:57.729
Okay. Drink that
in the next five seconds.

01:13:57.731 --> 01:14:00.531
I don't wanna dance just yet.
We have to dance right now?

01:14:00.533 --> 01:14:02.533
Yes, come on.

01:14:02.535 --> 01:14:04.401
All right, fine.

01:15:11.868 --> 01:15:13.500
It's all about grass roots.

01:15:13.502 --> 01:15:14.601
And tonight you saw that.

01:15:17.806 --> 01:15:20.173
'Cause it's all about people,

01:15:20.175 --> 01:15:21.974
it's all about
every one of you,

01:15:21.976 --> 01:15:23.742
Democrats, Republicans,
inclusive.

01:15:38.889 --> 01:15:40.122
Hey.

01:15:41.524 --> 01:15:43.591
Hey.

01:15:43.593 --> 01:15:45.726
What're you doin' in here
all alone?

01:15:47.228 --> 01:15:49.829
That's how I like it,
I guess.

01:15:49.831 --> 01:15:51.130
Too bad.

01:15:52.832 --> 01:15:54.098
I wanna come bug you.

01:15:55.934 --> 01:15:58.135
- I thought you'd left.
- Nope.

01:16:05.943 --> 01:16:08.544
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

01:16:11.649 --> 01:16:16.518
It's weird. I feel like
nobody sees me like you do.

01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:18.987
It's true. I just think
these last couple months,

01:16:18.989 --> 01:16:22.090
like I've just felt like...

01:16:22.092 --> 01:16:24.958
invisible or somethin'
from not seeing you.

01:16:27.528 --> 01:16:29.795
I know.

01:16:29.797 --> 01:16:31.530
Me too.

01:16:37.770 --> 01:16:41.172
So what happened?

01:16:41.174 --> 01:16:42.907
What do you mean?

01:16:42.909 --> 01:16:44.541
Like after that night.

01:16:44.543 --> 01:16:46.943
- Oh, that.
- Yeah.

01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:55.751
Sorry. I don't mean
to make you uncomfortable.

01:16:55.753 --> 01:16:57.652
No, no, I wanna...

01:16:57.654 --> 01:16:59.320
I just can't be fake
with you, you know?

01:16:59.322 --> 01:17:02.022
It's just impossible.

01:17:02.024 --> 01:17:03.256
I know.

01:17:05.626 --> 01:17:07.627
I don't know
what happened, Danny.

01:17:07.629 --> 01:17:10.129
I guess I just...

01:17:10.131 --> 01:17:12.197
freaked out.

01:17:12.199 --> 01:17:16.668
You freaked out?
Wow. The tables turned.

01:17:16.670 --> 01:17:19.336
I don't know.
I didn't wanna lose you and...

01:17:21.872 --> 01:17:24.573
I just couldn't deal.

01:17:24.575 --> 01:17:27.642
Welcome to my world.

01:17:27.644 --> 01:17:29.243
Yeah, I guess we both
couldn't deal.

01:17:29.245 --> 01:17:32.179
Yeah. I've been not dealing
my entire life.

01:17:32.181 --> 01:17:36.349
I'm so tired of it.
I just wanna deal for once.

01:17:36.351 --> 01:17:38.150
See how the other half lives,
you know?

01:17:41.287 --> 01:17:43.121
What?

01:17:43.123 --> 01:17:45.022
What's goin' on?

01:17:45.024 --> 01:17:46.690
I don't know. It's dumb.

01:17:46.692 --> 01:17:50.660
Well, you do too.
I'm just not saying it.

01:17:50.662 --> 01:17:53.929
Like you want me
to really say it?

01:17:53.931 --> 01:17:58.233
I don't know. I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:17:58.235 --> 01:18:01.336
I wanna kiss you right now,
okay? That's the truth.

01:18:01.338 --> 01:18:03.338
And I feel like
that's all I ever do

01:18:03.340 --> 01:18:05.206
is like I have to pretend
that I don't wanna kiss you

01:18:05.208 --> 01:18:07.641
every time I'm with you.

01:18:07.643 --> 01:18:09.242
And I get to like
hang out with you and Emmy

01:18:09.244 --> 01:18:12.044
and have dinner
and come party here,

01:18:12.046 --> 01:18:17.015
and it's just...
I'm just tired of it.

01:18:17.017 --> 01:18:20.118
I like you, you know?
And I like being around you.

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:24.755
I'm just waiting, you know,
for them to leave

01:18:24.757 --> 01:18:26.123
so I can be alone again,

01:18:26.125 --> 01:18:29.659
and I never feel that
with you.

01:18:29.661 --> 01:18:31.193
Shut up.

01:18:31.195 --> 01:18:32.928
No.

01:18:32.930 --> 01:18:36.631
I love you like this.

01:18:36.633 --> 01:18:37.732
You do?

01:18:47.008 --> 01:18:48.775
- Danny, Danny, stop.
- What?

01:18:48.777 --> 01:18:50.309
- We can't.
- Yes, we can.

01:18:50.311 --> 01:18:52.344
- No, we can't.
- Why not?

01:18:52.346 --> 01:18:54.813
There are people involved.
What are you doing?

01:18:54.815 --> 01:18:56.948
- I'm trying to shut you up.

01:18:56.950 --> 01:18:59.116
- Danny.
- What?

01:18:59.118 --> 01:19:00.283
What?

01:19:28.044 --> 01:19:29.911
Danny.

01:19:29.913 --> 01:19:32.847
- What?
- Danny, don't do this.

01:19:33.982 --> 01:19:36.917
What? This is me dealing.

01:19:36.919 --> 01:19:38.318
You're happy.

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:43.389
That's not what you were that
night with me, that's for sure.

01:19:45.158 --> 01:19:47.125
Look, we were--
Emmy and I were fighting,

01:19:47.127 --> 01:19:49.093
I was upset.
You can't just use that.

01:19:49.095 --> 01:19:54.731
I felt it, okay?
And I felt it from you.

01:19:54.733 --> 01:19:57.300
Tell me you're happy.

01:19:57.302 --> 01:20:00.903
Fuck you!
Who do you think you are?

01:20:00.905 --> 01:20:03.205
I'm not gonna prove myself
to you, okay?

01:20:03.207 --> 01:20:05.774
Tell me you love her.

01:20:10.479 --> 01:20:11.979
Hi, you guys!

01:20:11.981 --> 01:20:13.280
Hey!

01:20:14.248 --> 01:20:16.115
Whoa.

01:20:16.117 --> 01:20:18.383
- What's goin' on here?
- What are you talking about?

01:20:18.385 --> 01:20:20.785
- Am I interrupting, huh?
- Don't be ridiculous.

01:20:20.787 --> 01:20:22.386
I gotta go, actually,
but this was a great night.

01:20:22.388 --> 01:20:25.422
- Oh, my God.
- I had a great time.

01:20:25.424 --> 01:20:27.891
Wait a minute.
You stay here for a second.

01:20:27.893 --> 01:20:31.728
You guys do me a favor.
I just want you to make out.

01:20:31.730 --> 01:20:35.198
Because this weird
sexual tension between you guys

01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:36.465
is driving me insane.

01:20:36.467 --> 01:20:38.867
And if you just make out once,

01:20:38.869 --> 01:20:40.935
you'll see that
there's nothing to it,

01:20:40.937 --> 01:20:43.370
and it'll be gone.

01:20:43.372 --> 01:20:45.138
- Uh, no.
- Yeah. Please?

01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:46.506
- No. For me.
- No thanks.

01:20:46.508 --> 01:20:48.274
Come on, one little kiss.

01:20:48.276 --> 01:20:49.575
I don't think
she's gonna leave us alone.

01:20:49.577 --> 01:20:51.209
Come on, it's my big night.

01:20:51.211 --> 01:20:53.578
We'll just give her
one little kiss.

01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:56.614
- That's all she wants, right?
- There you go.

01:20:56.616 --> 01:20:58.515
That's it.
That's fine, right?

01:20:58.517 --> 01:21:02.218
See? Nothing.
She's right.

01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:04.053
I gotta go.
I'll see you. Have a--

01:21:04.055 --> 01:21:05.888
Congratulations again.

01:21:08.157 --> 01:21:10.091
What the fuck was that?

01:21:12.427 --> 01:21:14.895
What the hell's going on?

01:21:23.102 --> 01:21:25.503
I'm not bullying you!
I'm asking you a question!

01:21:25.505 --> 01:21:28.138
Okay, so I don't get
to ask you any questions,

01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:30.073
even though you were crying
and you were back here

01:21:30.075 --> 01:21:32.075
instead of being out there
with me on my big night.

01:21:32.077 --> 01:21:36.145
You didn't even know
I was gone.

01:21:36.147 --> 01:21:38.380
Oh, give me a break.

01:21:38.382 --> 01:21:40.448
Now you're gonna be a crybaby,

01:21:40.450 --> 01:21:42.450
that I wasn't paying
enough attention to you?

01:21:42.452 --> 01:21:45.986
Do you know what I've
been doing all night?

01:21:45.988 --> 01:21:48.455
- Come here.
- I'm gonna go.

01:21:48.457 --> 01:21:49.889
- Oh, come on.
- No, no.

01:21:49.891 --> 01:21:51.657
Oh, come on!

01:21:51.659 --> 01:21:53.158
Carla.

01:21:54.126 --> 01:21:57.027
Come on!

01:21:57.029 --> 01:21:59.496
- Come on, Carla.
- Let go.

01:21:59.498 --> 01:22:03.967
Yeah, I'm gonna go.
You stay. You enjoy this.

01:22:03.969 --> 01:22:08.171
No, I'm not gonna stay.
You're just gonna leave like...

01:22:08.173 --> 01:22:11.107
What is going on?

01:22:11.109 --> 01:22:13.042
I don't know what else
to say to you.

01:22:13.044 --> 01:22:14.576
I'm done.

01:22:25.954 --> 01:22:29.323
<i>We all have impulses</i>
<i>and feelings,</i>

01:22:29.325 --> 01:22:31.625
<i>but you can't act on it</i>
<i> just whenever you feel it.</i>

01:22:31.627 --> 01:22:34.060
<i>I always feel kinda like</i>
<i>invisible in the world.</i>

01:22:34.062 --> 01:22:37.363
<i>Do you want something</i>
<i>that's extraordinary</i>

01:22:37.365 --> 01:22:41.367
<i>or something that's like</i>

01:22:41.369 --> 01:22:45.304
<i>Right, 'cause being</i>
<i>alone's not even an option.</i>

01:22:45.306 --> 01:22:47.606
<i>That sounds excruciating.</i>

01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:30.593
Just stick with us.

01:25:30.595 --> 01:25:32.861
Stick with us.

01:25:32.863 --> 01:25:36.264
- Did you pack the charger?
- The charger?

01:25:36.266 --> 01:25:37.698
- The charger.
- Phone charger?

01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:39.833
- Yes.
- I don't have a charger.

01:25:39.835 --> 01:25:41.568
- You had the charger.
- What do you mean?

01:25:41.570 --> 01:25:43.436
You said you were
going to pack it!

01:25:43.438 --> 01:25:44.737
No, you said you were.

01:25:44.739 --> 01:25:47.106
Grace, stay away
from the railing.

01:25:47.108 --> 01:25:49.408
I said I was gonna
pack the charger?

01:25:49.410 --> 01:25:52.611
Oh, I'm the charger man.
I see.

01:25:57.149 --> 01:25:58.449
What's goin' on?

01:25:58.451 --> 01:25:59.650
Nothing.

01:26:15.533 --> 01:26:18.334
Wanna hear something?

01:26:18.336 --> 01:26:19.835
What?

01:26:19.837 --> 01:26:21.670
I'm a dancer.

01:26:21.672 --> 01:26:23.204
You're a dancer?

01:26:23.206 --> 01:26:24.705
Yeah.

01:26:24.707 --> 01:26:27.240
What kinda dancer are you?

01:26:27.242 --> 01:26:29.208
Jump, jump.

01:26:29.210 --> 01:26:30.842
- Wow. That's pretty good.
- Twirl.

01:26:30.844 --> 01:26:33.878
Oh, she's just teaching me
a little dance move.

01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:36.280
Shh! Don't pay attention
to them.

01:26:36.282 --> 01:26:38.715
- Are those your parents?
- No.

01:26:38.717 --> 01:26:41.718
No, 'cause they're not
dancers like us.

01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:43.219
They're not dancers like us?

01:26:43.221 --> 01:26:47.156
How do you know I can dance?
I'm not that good.

01:26:47.158 --> 01:26:49.224
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:26:49.226 --> 01:26:51.793
Because you are.
I know that.

01:26:51.795 --> 01:26:53.427
- You know it?
- Yeah.

01:26:53.429 --> 01:26:54.428
Oh.

01:26:54.430 --> 01:26:57.431
What? Ready?
Here I go.

01:27:05.406 --> 01:27:06.773
Twirl.

01:27:06.775 --> 01:27:10.443
Jump, jump and up.

01:27:21.187 --> 01:27:22.687
I told you a hundred times
to pack the charger!

01:27:26.925 --> 01:27:28.825
Now you twirl me.

01:27:30.527 --> 01:27:33.729
I am not responsible
for the charger.

01:27:40.302 --> 01:27:42.269
It's gonna be
down the hall to your left.

01:27:42.271 --> 01:27:44.604
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

01:27:48.943 --> 01:27:53.312
Thank you. We're gonna have
a Q&A with the director.

01:27:53.314 --> 01:27:56.348
Please stick around
as I introduce Daniel Sullivan.

01:27:56.350 --> 01:27:58.850
Um...

01:27:58.852 --> 01:28:02.220
I don't know. I mean,
I like movies that just end.

01:28:02.222 --> 01:28:03.988
You know, I never buy it
when they're like

01:28:03.990 --> 01:28:06.790
tying it all up in a bow
at the end, you know?

01:28:06.792 --> 01:28:09.492
Yeah, but there has to be
some sort of conclusion.

01:28:09.494 --> 01:28:11.627
Does there? I don't know. Why?
Why can't it just end?

01:28:11.629 --> 01:28:13.428
Because as an audience,

01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:15.296
there has to be a reason
we're watching.

01:28:15.298 --> 01:28:18.565
because you're engaged
by what's going on

01:28:18.567 --> 01:28:21.301
and you're interested
in the characters and...

01:28:21.303 --> 01:28:23.403
Yeah, but there has to be
a journey to follow.

01:28:23.405 --> 01:28:25.571
That's not my favorite word
"journey,"

01:28:25.573 --> 01:28:27.906
but I mean, everything's
a journey, isn't it?

01:28:27.908 --> 01:28:30.008
I mean, this conversation,
for example,

01:28:30.010 --> 01:28:34.412
But we have to take something
from any piece of art.

01:28:34.414 --> 01:28:38.716
But what does that have
to do with endings, really?

01:28:38.718 --> 01:28:40.517
You can't just
stop things happening

01:28:40.519 --> 01:28:43.920
But I think you can.
That's what an ending is.

01:28:43.922 --> 01:28:46.989
then all of a sudden
there is a journey,

01:28:46.991 --> 01:28:49.691
I think you're taking this
the wrong way.

01:28:49.693 --> 01:28:53.695
but I felt like I was
missing something,

01:28:53.697 --> 01:28:57.999
Right, but for me
I take that as a compliment

01:28:58.001 --> 01:29:00.401
because I think
that life is unfinished,

01:29:00.403 --> 01:29:02.870
and I think that art and film
should reflect that.

01:29:02.872 --> 01:29:07.407
I think that, you know,
there are structures to a movie

01:29:07.409 --> 01:29:10.610
but now even
in small independent

01:29:10.612 --> 01:29:13.346
and, you know,
documentaries like this,

01:29:13.348 --> 01:29:16.282
you have to fulfill
this preconceived idea

01:29:16.284 --> 01:29:19.818
and if you don't hit
all these points,

01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:21.719
somehow the audience thinks
there's something missing

01:29:21.721 --> 01:29:26.523
and in that constantly
looking for what's missing,

01:29:26.525 --> 01:29:28.558
we're not seeing what's there.

01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:31.360
And, I mean,
for me personally,

01:29:31.362 --> 01:29:34.663
it's really in the looking
that we are missing.

01:29:36.565 --> 01:29:39.733
I mean, that's just sort of
my personal thing on endings.

01:29:39.735 --> 01:29:42.068
I don't know if that
answered your question, but...

01:29:42.070 --> 01:29:45.604
It's an interesting
discussion anyway.

01:29:45.606 --> 01:29:48.873
Um, I think we have time for
one more. One more question?

01:29:48.875 --> 01:29:51.742
Yeah, I could totally fall
in love with the process.

01:29:51.744 --> 01:29:54.044
But that was probably
I was in love with the film.

01:29:54.046 --> 01:29:56.046
- Hi. Thank you for you coming.
- Thank you.

01:29:56.048 --> 01:29:57.947
Yeah, have a good night.

01:29:57.949 --> 01:30:00.482
I, uh...

01:30:00.484 --> 01:30:02.550
Yeah, I loved everything
about it.

01:30:02.552 --> 01:30:06.320
Um, it was great.
It was a really great process.

01:30:06.322 --> 01:30:08.322
Thank you, guys, so much
for coming.

01:30:08.324 --> 01:30:10.857
It was nice
to meet you all, yeah.

01:30:10.859 --> 01:30:12.925
We'll see you later on, okay?

01:30:14.827 --> 01:30:16.427
What are you doing here?

01:30:16.429 --> 01:30:19.430
I come to this festival
every year.

01:30:19.432 --> 01:30:21.398
You do not.

01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:25.935
Oh, my God.
It's so nice to see you.

01:30:25.937 --> 01:30:27.836
Hi.

01:30:27.838 --> 01:30:29.971
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:30:29.973 --> 01:30:31.472
I can't believe you're here.
It's so wild.

01:30:31.474 --> 01:30:33.407
- I loved it so much.
- You did?

01:30:33.409 --> 01:30:34.975
- Yeah, I was really...
- Are you just saying that?

01:30:34.977 --> 01:30:38.511
Yeah. Isn't that
what I'm supposed to do?

01:30:38.513 --> 01:30:40.479
- No, I really loved it.
- You did.

01:30:40.481 --> 01:30:42.914
- Yeah, I was so moved.
- I'm glad you saw it.

01:30:42.916 --> 01:30:44.649
Where were you sitting?
I didn't even see you.

01:30:44.651 --> 01:30:46.784
I was hiding.
I was in the back.

01:30:46.786 --> 01:30:48.118
- You hid?
- Mm-hmm.

01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:50.053
But you have bad vision.

01:30:50.055 --> 01:30:52.922
That's true.
I didn't have my glasses on.

01:30:52.924 --> 01:30:55.557
- Yeah, it's awesome.
- Thank you.

01:30:55.559 --> 01:30:57.058
And it's impressive
that you actually finished it

01:30:57.060 --> 01:30:59.760
after all these years.

01:30:59.762 --> 01:31:01.661
I mean, well,
apparently I didn't finish it,

01:31:01.663 --> 01:31:03.029
according to some people.

01:31:03.031 --> 01:31:04.964
That guy was such a douchebag.

01:31:04.966 --> 01:31:07.633
No, really,
there's one at every Q&A,

01:31:07.635 --> 01:31:10.102
and they're always
some frustrated filmmaker.

01:31:10.104 --> 01:31:13.371
There's always one at every Q&A,
and you can tell.

01:31:13.373 --> 01:31:14.638
Now that I think of it,
that's who that guy was.

01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:16.406
Yeah, that's who he was.

01:31:16.408 --> 01:31:19.575
But I liked what you said.

01:31:19.577 --> 01:31:23.045
"It's in that looking
that we are missing."

01:31:23.047 --> 01:31:25.714
- You liked that one?
- Yeah.

01:31:25.716 --> 01:31:27.949
I thought it was maybe
a little pretentious or--

01:31:27.951 --> 01:31:31.819
It was totally pretentious,
but he deserved it.

01:31:31.821 --> 01:31:34.054
It's so good to see you.
You look great.

01:31:34.056 --> 01:31:36.956
- I do?
- Yeah.

01:31:36.958 --> 01:31:39.025
- Do you wanna...
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:31:39.027 --> 01:31:40.726
You walking out?
Let me grab my coat.

01:31:45.998 --> 01:31:49.767
I can't believe you're here.
It's so crazy.

01:31:49.769 --> 01:31:52.970
Where are you staying?

01:31:52.972 --> 01:31:56.206
I don't know.
Just got into town.

01:32:01.078 --> 01:32:04.180
Well, what are you doing
right now?

01:32:04.182 --> 01:32:07.149
Um... I'm free.

01:32:07.151 --> 01:32:08.884
Really?
You're free?

01:32:08.886 --> 01:32:10.585
- I'm so lucky.
- I'm available.

01:32:10.587 --> 01:32:13.020
You're available.

01:32:13.022 --> 01:32:14.788
Wanna get a cup of coffee?

01:32:14.790 --> 01:32:17.290
Yeah, but I have something
kind of serious news.

01:32:17.292 --> 01:32:18.257
What?

01:32:20.627 --> 01:32:21.793
I quit coffee.

01:32:21.795 --> 01:32:23.694
Get out of here.

01:32:23.696 --> 01:32:26.163
You quit coffee?

01:32:26.165 --> 01:32:28.532
Of all the people
in the world.

01:32:28.534 --> 01:32:29.833
Yeah.

01:32:32.237 --> 01:32:34.070
Who <i>are</i> you?
