NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

00:03.503 --> 00:07.132
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

00:07.240 --> 00:08.332
In New York City,

00:08.408 --> 00:11.343
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.444 --> 00:15.005
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

00:15.081 --> 00:16.605
These are their stories,

00:19.452 --> 00:21.886
Hey, wait, wait.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Let's go someplace else.

00:21.955 --> 00:23.752
I got a better place. Come on.

00:26.126 --> 00:27.923
Where you take
all your other girls?

00:27.994 --> 00:31.191
Come on now. You know
I don't have nobody but you.

00:32.598 --> 00:35.227
What's over here?
The view is better.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:44.444 --> 00:45.843
What's that?

00:45.912 --> 00:50.713
It's nothing. It's nothing.
Relax. Come on now.
Relax. It's nothing.

00:55.288 --> 00:56.550
I hear footsteps.

00:56.623 --> 00:59.456
Look, I don't hear nothing.
What's up?
Do you want me or not?

00:59.526 --> 01:01.016
STABLER: We want you, Leon.

01:01.094 --> 01:04.029
Who's that?
TATE: Oh, man,
that's the sex police.

01:05.298 --> 01:06.492
Why they want you?

01:06.566 --> 01:09.330
It's this cop, man.
He got this thing for me
or something Iike that.

01:09.402 --> 01:12.565
Not even out of prison
two weeks. I told you
he's not gonna stop.

01:12.639 --> 01:13.731
Over there.

01:13.807 --> 01:14.899
BENSON: Come here.
What he do?

01:14.974 --> 01:17.306
Come here with me.
I didn't do nothing, man.
He framed me.

01:17.377 --> 01:19.242
Keep right on
thinking that, Leon.
What'd he do?

01:19.312 --> 01:20.973
How old are you?
Fourteen.

01:21.047 --> 01:22.480
Oh, you's a Iying bitch.

01:22.549 --> 01:25.040
Yo, man, Nashika told me
she graduated high school.

01:25.118 --> 01:26.813
Yo, tell them
I ain't forced you.

01:26.886 --> 01:28.649
I wanted to be with him.
Okay.

01:28.721 --> 01:31.281
The Iaw says
you're not old enough
to make that decision.

01:31.357 --> 01:34.258
Now, was he gonna
use protection?
We didn't talk about it.

01:34.327 --> 01:37.319
I bet he didn't even mention
that he's HIV positive,
did he?

01:37.397 --> 01:39.627
Bastard has the virus? Man!

01:39.699 --> 01:40.757
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.802
Nashika, come here.
Settle, settle, settle.

01:42.869 --> 01:44.268
Yo, man,
you can't give that up.

01:44.337 --> 01:46.862
I just did. What are you
gonna do about it?

01:47.107 --> 01:51.009
Look at me. It's okay.
Nashika, have you ever
had sex with him?

01:54.681 --> 01:57.206
Tonight would have been
the first time.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.274
Okay, Iet's go.

02:49.702 --> 02:52.603
So how many Iittle girls
have you had sex with
since you been out?

02:52.672 --> 02:54.333
Yo, man, you ain't
have no right to follow me.

02:54.407 --> 02:58.104
Hey. Hey. Don't tell me
how to do my job.
Answer the question.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.840
So you can put me away
again for nothing?

03:00.914 --> 03:03.883
Man, Iisten, the young Iadies
feel me, it's not my fault.

03:03.950 --> 03:05.611
It is if they're jailbait.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.676
They want to pleasure me,
who am I to stop them?

03:07.754 --> 03:10.746
And if you infect them with
your HIV, it's their problem,
too, right?

03:10.823 --> 03:14.725
Look, man, you ambushed us
before I even had
an opportunity to tell her.

03:14.794 --> 03:16.352
I had protection.

03:16.429 --> 03:19.159
Her protection is
me putting you back
in your Iittle cage.

03:21.134 --> 03:24.433
Why don't you
just get off my case, man?
'Cause I don't Iike you.

03:28.408 --> 03:32.606
AII right, well, I don't
have nothing else to say
until my Iegal aid gets here.

03:35.348 --> 03:37.782
I'm surprised he said
as much as he did.

03:37.850 --> 03:39.841
He has the personality
of a repeater.

03:39.919 --> 03:42.752
He can do no wrong.
Nothing is his fault.

03:43.690 --> 03:46.124
CABOT:
What was he in prison for?
Five years, sodomy two.

03:46.192 --> 03:47.887
After I finally convinced

03:47.961 --> 03:50.521
one of the numerous
underage girls
he had oral sex with

03:50.597 --> 03:51.996
to come forward
and file a complaint.

03:52.065 --> 03:55.000
Now he's escalating
to intercourse.
You're speculating, EIIiot.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.502
He wasn't in the act
when you stopped him.
That's a problem.

03:57.570 --> 04:00.368
Attempted rape two,
attempted reckless
endangerment,

04:00.440 --> 04:03.568
because he didn't disclose
that he was HIV positive.

04:03.643 --> 04:04.803
Where's the problem here?

04:04.877 --> 04:06.845
We can't hold him
based on what he might do.

04:06.913 --> 04:09.143
So we're supposed to wait
until after he infects
the girl?

04:09.215 --> 04:10.477
She consented.

04:10.550 --> 04:13.280
His attorney will say he was
carrying condoms
and planned to use them.

04:13.353 --> 04:14.479
We can't prove otherwise.

04:14.554 --> 04:19.116
We know that Leon
was about to have
unprotected sex with a minor.

04:19.192 --> 04:21.922
Now, we cut him Ioose,
he's going to.

04:21.995 --> 04:25.863
You got anything in your bag
of tricks, Counselor, now is
the time to pull it out.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.661
I have something,
but I'II have to check.

04:27.734 --> 04:30.760
And I'II have to involve
your psychiatrist.
I'II give him a call.

04:30.837 --> 04:34.136
Get him Tate's prison
history, arrest records,
whatever you could find.

04:34.207 --> 04:36.698
Leon's rap sheet starts
when he was seven years old.

04:36.776 --> 04:38.767
He had 1 1 arrests
by his 13th birthday.

04:38.845 --> 04:40.938
The record was sealed
because he was a juvenile.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.982
Let's get them unsealed.

04:47.353 --> 04:49.253
EIIiot, close the door.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.051
Yeah?

04:55.628 --> 04:58.529
I don't remember telling you
to tail Leon Tate.

05:00.900 --> 05:03.425
I heard he was out.
Just keeping my eye on him.

05:03.503 --> 05:04.970
Well, this squad doesn't have
enough bodies

05:05.038 --> 05:07.336
for you and your partner
to go freelancing.

05:09.609 --> 05:12.874
I Iike to think that we saved
a young girl's Iife tonight.

05:12.945 --> 05:16.346
And we would need a new unit
if we were to follow
every perv

05:16.416 --> 05:18.509
that we thought might repeat.

05:18.584 --> 05:20.279
Leon Tate did his time.

05:20.353 --> 05:23.117
And until somebody
makes a complaint,
he has rights.

05:23.189 --> 05:26.420
This guy's penis is a deadly
weapon and he's got
a thing for young girls.

05:26.492 --> 05:27.686
They got rights, too.

05:27.760 --> 05:32.163
Until Cabot gives us
the word, you back off.
Are we clear?

05:36.769 --> 05:38.600
We can't charge Leon Tate
with a crime,

05:38.671 --> 05:40.696
so you wanna Iock him up
in a mental institution?

05:40.773 --> 05:43.503
The Supreme Court
in Kansas v, Hendricks
upheld States' rights

05:43.576 --> 05:45.771
to commit sexual predators
after their prison sentences.

05:45.845 --> 05:49.281
Yes, Kansas and 16
other states have Iaws
specifically for that purpose.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.782
New York does not.

05:50.850 --> 05:53.011
We can use the existing
mental hygiene Iaw.

05:53.086 --> 05:55.384
AII we have to do is
prove Leon Tate
has a mental illness

05:55.455 --> 05:58.356
that poses a Iikelihood
of danger to himself
or to others.

05:58.424 --> 06:02.224
You really want to risk
trying to set a precedent
with this case?

06:02.295 --> 06:04.763
Leon Tate is a
sexual predator with HIV.

06:04.831 --> 06:06.458
I think we have
a responsibility

06:06.532 --> 06:09.296
to protect people from him
and others Iike him.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.859
AII right. You give me
something to work with.

06:10.937 --> 06:13.497
I'II see if the D.A.
will go for it.

06:15.074 --> 06:18.601
Problem is even if the woman
Iies about her age,
it's still the man's fault.

06:18.678 --> 06:20.009
Ignorance is no defense.

06:20.079 --> 06:23.571
Nashika Morris is 14.
She's not a woman,
she's a girl.

06:23.649 --> 06:26.174
What's a guy supposed to do,
check the girl's
birth certificate?

06:26.252 --> 06:28.686
I'm just as opposed to rape
as everybody else
in this room,

06:28.755 --> 06:31.417
but if she wanted to have sex,
that's her choice.
She wasn't forced.

06:31.491 --> 06:33.789
She's a minor.
What she wants isn't relevant.

06:33.860 --> 06:37.387
Are we interrupting?
Friendly disagreement.
Care to join in?

06:37.463 --> 06:40.023
I came to tell you
that the D.A.'s allowing us
to move on Leon Tate.

06:40.099 --> 06:41.191
On what grounds?

06:41.267 --> 06:44.031
Based upon the reports
that I've read, I think
that I can make a case

06:44.103 --> 06:46.936
that Mr. Tate has
anti-social personality
disorder.

06:47.006 --> 06:48.234
That's what I've been
saying all along.

06:48.307 --> 06:50.275
No empathy, no conscience,

06:50.343 --> 06:52.607
no thought for the possible
consequences of his actions.

06:52.678 --> 06:55.579
So he knows
what he's doing is wrong.
And he doesn't care.

06:55.648 --> 06:59.744
Most people with HIV
act responsibly when it comes
to practicing safe sex.

06:59.819 --> 07:02.947
Tate either can't control
or won't control his impulses,

07:03.022 --> 07:04.614
which make him
a repeat sex offender.

07:04.690 --> 07:07.420
Yeah, he's a sexual predator.
Now he's definitely
a danger to others.

07:07.493 --> 07:09.290
Which is the standard set
by the Supreme Court.

07:09.362 --> 07:11.830
HUANG: Do we know
how he contracted HIV?
Yeah, shooting dope.

07:11.898 --> 07:13.832
He found out
when he was tested in prison.

07:13.900 --> 07:16.460
One fix wipes away
any self-control
that Tate has Ieft,

07:16.536 --> 07:19.096
making him even more Iikely
to have unprotected sex
with a minor.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.571
And this is already
in the works?

07:20.640 --> 07:23.040
We argue the motion
for a commitment hearing
this afternoon.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.701
It would be a big help
if you could be there

07:24.777 --> 07:26.904
in case the judge
has questions
about Tate's past.

07:26.979 --> 07:28.879
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

07:32.285 --> 07:35.152
REGAL: Your Honor,
it's double jeopardy
disguised as treatment.

07:35.221 --> 07:37.052
CABOT: Supreme Court
Kansas v, Hendricks,

07:37.123 --> 07:39.887
civil commitment
of a sexual predator
is not punitive.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.325
They arrested Mr. Tate
and couldn't make
the charges stick,

07:42.395 --> 07:45.023
so they put a Iabel on him
for a one-way trip
to the funny farm.

07:45.097 --> 07:47.156
I get the point, Ms. Regal.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.196
ELMORE: Doctor Huang.
Yes?

07:49.268 --> 07:52.294
Other than an
anti-social personality,

07:52.371 --> 07:56.671
did you find any evidence
that the defendant
has a sexual disorder?

07:56.876 --> 07:57.934
Yes.

07:58.044 --> 08:01.502
Mr. Tate expresses his
narcissism and his anger
by having unprotected sex

08:01.581 --> 08:05.677
with underage, powerless girls
and not disclosing
that he's HIV positive.

08:05.751 --> 08:08.982
Detective Stabler,
when you arrested Mr. Tate,
how did you know for certain

08:09.055 --> 08:11.319
that he was going
to have sex with the girl?

08:11.390 --> 08:12.618
Ms. Morris told us so.

08:12.692 --> 08:14.523
We found condoms on Tate
when we searched him.

08:15.795 --> 08:19.128
Well, wouldn't that indicate
that Mr. Tate
planned safe sex?

08:19.198 --> 08:21.462
Even so, the girl's a minor.
That's rape two.

08:21.534 --> 08:24.332
Your Honor, Detective Stabler
can in no way predict
what my client

08:24.403 --> 08:25.768
may or may not
have done that night.

08:25.838 --> 08:28.398
Your client Iikes Iittle girls
and if we don't stop him now,

08:28.474 --> 08:30.908
he's gonna kill one of them.
Enough.

08:31.911 --> 08:35.870
I agree something
has to be done about
repeat sexual offenders,

08:36.215 --> 08:39.912
but I am not gonna put
this man through a civil
commitment hearing

08:39.986 --> 08:44.251
unless you can prove
that his intent was
unprotected sex.

08:45.324 --> 08:46.985
Judge was afraid
to stick her neck out.

08:47.059 --> 08:50.722
Maybe she'II change her mind
when we wheel a body
into her chambers.

08:50.796 --> 08:52.889
Who's catching?
That would be me. What's up?

08:52.965 --> 08:57.595
Rape. Rooftop in Harlem,
15-year-old victim
at Metro Hospital's ER.

08:57.670 --> 09:00.468
It's Tate's m.o.
We'II take it.
Be my guest.

09:00.540 --> 09:04.271
EIIiot, I've got two days
to finish up the paperwork
on the Wilson case

09:04.343 --> 09:05.776
or I'm in contempt of court.

09:05.845 --> 09:07.608
I'II go.
CRAGEN: AII right.

09:08.614 --> 09:12.050
I don't want you trying
to pin Tate to every
sex crime in Harlem.

09:17.189 --> 09:20.716
I met him in the park
down the block
from our apartment.

09:21.561 --> 09:25.759
He told me he could get me
a rap audition,
that he was a promoter.

09:27.967 --> 09:29.457
I fell for it.

09:29.669 --> 09:31.694
Shareen, it's not your fault.

09:31.771 --> 09:34.797
Did he tell you his name?
Andre.

09:36.409 --> 09:37.967
He seemed nice.

09:38.911 --> 09:42.369
Said I was smart and talented.

09:43.182 --> 09:44.672
What happened?

09:45.151 --> 09:48.382
He took me out
to a real restaurant.

09:49.655 --> 09:53.216
Then he walked me home.
When we got to my door,

09:54.493 --> 09:58.759
he said it was a beautiful
night, and that I was
aglow Iike the stars,

09:59.432 --> 10:01.832
that we should go
to the rooftop.

10:02.501 --> 10:06.369
He started to kiss me.
I told him to stop.

10:07.306 --> 10:08.796
He slapped me,

10:10.109 --> 10:13.442
pulled a knife,
ripped off my clothes,

10:15.247 --> 10:17.306
and then he...

10:19.085 --> 10:20.211
(CRYING)

10:24.090 --> 10:26.718
Did he say anything
during the attack?

10:26.892 --> 10:31.761
That I was Iucky
to experience him
'cause he was so handsome.

10:32.965 --> 10:34.933
He was the Iove machine,

10:36.235 --> 10:39.966
and that he was gonna make me
into a woman when he was done.

10:44.877 --> 10:46.640
We'II be right back.

10:48.414 --> 10:51.315
She's got a detached retina,
concussion.

10:51.717 --> 10:53.776
Basically, he used her face
for a punching bag.

10:53.853 --> 10:56.378
Okay, tell the doctor
that the rapist may have HIV.

10:56.455 --> 10:58.286
Okay. Where are you going?

10:58.357 --> 10:59.346
Back to the office.

10:59.425 --> 11:03.657
That "Iove machine" Iine?
I've heard it before.

11:05.531 --> 11:09.160
In '93 right after I got here,
13-year-old rape victim
Vanessa Hiltz.

11:09.235 --> 11:12.534
Perp said he was gonna
make a woman out of her,
that he was the Iove machine.

11:12.605 --> 11:14.266
You get anywhere on the case?

11:14.874 --> 11:17.604
Was gonna run the DNA in '95
when they first
started testing,

11:17.677 --> 11:21.443
but back then you couldn't
get it done unless you
already had the collar.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.641
And you think
Leon Tate is our guy.

11:23.716 --> 11:26.412
I contacted the victim.
She's got AIDS.

11:26.719 --> 11:29.017
Perp sweet-talked her
just Iike Leon.

11:30.623 --> 11:31.885
I don't know how I missed it.

11:31.957 --> 11:34.289
CRAGEN: Well, banging your
head against the wall
isn't gonna help.

11:34.360 --> 11:38.262
Pick Tate up and see if
his victims are in any kind
of shape for a Iineup.

11:45.037 --> 11:48.632
I pounded on his door.
If he's in there,
he's got a bad headache.

11:50.776 --> 11:52.038
You okay?

11:52.478 --> 11:57.609
Yeah. I just don't Iike
some guy making my home turf
dangerous for young girls.

11:58.484 --> 12:02.318
I thought you grew up
in Brooklyn.
Nope. About 10 blocks
from here.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.549
Ground zero for the '68 riots.

12:04.623 --> 12:05.715
What was that Iike?

12:05.791 --> 12:09.022
I was six. My mother said
the only way we're
Ieaving our apartment

12:09.095 --> 12:11.029
was if somebody
burned it down.

12:11.597 --> 12:13.224
This your guy?

12:14.667 --> 12:17.067
Son of a bitch is at it again.

12:17.203 --> 12:18.431
You, come here.

12:18.504 --> 12:20.438
Yo, come on, man.
Yo, she's 17.
checked her ID.

12:20.506 --> 12:21.666
We didn't do nothing.

12:21.741 --> 12:22.730
Assume the position.

12:22.808 --> 12:25.538
See how they do?
So what's up, man?
The hood got you scared,

12:25.611 --> 12:27.875
you had to bring
Uncle Tom with you?
You didn't mean that.

12:27.947 --> 12:29.505
You know something?
I think you just
upset my partner.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.607
You should apologize.
Yeah, go ahead with...

12:31.684 --> 12:33.811
AII right, all right,
all right. I apologize,
I apologize.

12:33.886 --> 12:36.218
You know Casanova here
has HIV?

12:37.156 --> 12:39.317
That the truth?
Yo, man, don't believe them.

12:39.391 --> 12:42.292
No. Is it the truth?
Yo, I got protection.

12:42.628 --> 12:44.994
I don't care if you got
a bulletproof vest
for that thing.

12:45.064 --> 12:46.258
You should have told me.

12:46.332 --> 12:47.424
Oh, now there she go.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.866
Yo, man, my Iegal aid told me
I can sue you
for telling anybody.

12:49.935 --> 12:51.163
Yeah, so go ahead and do it.

12:51.237 --> 12:53.637
We'II say it slipped out
while we busted you
for rape and assault.

12:53.706 --> 12:54.900
Do what?
Yo, I ain't raped nobody.

12:54.974 --> 12:56.669
Yeah, I'II bet you're not
the Iove machine, either.

12:56.742 --> 12:59.210
Yo, man, what you
talking about, man?
Why y'all doing this to me?

12:59.278 --> 13:02.213
"Doing it to me."
It's all about you, huh, Leon?

13:04.416 --> 13:06.077
It's been a while.

13:06.952 --> 13:08.681
It's okay, Vanessa.

13:09.655 --> 13:11.748
Do you recognize
any of these men?

13:14.827 --> 13:16.294
I'm not sure.

13:19.765 --> 13:22.495
Take your time.
No coaching, Counselor.

13:28.274 --> 13:32.370
I wish I could tell you
one of them's him. I'm sorry.

13:32.511 --> 13:36.948
It's all right. It's
all right. It's all right.
Okay. Come on. Thank you.

13:37.016 --> 13:38.074
(CRYING)

13:49.195 --> 13:53.996
Okay, you ready?
They can't see you.
They can't see you.

13:55.167 --> 13:57.260
Help me up.
Yeah. Come on.

14:08.113 --> 14:10.547
STABLER: Do you recognize
any of these men?

14:18.958 --> 14:20.289
CABOT: Which one?

14:23.896 --> 14:25.659
I can't tell.

14:27.399 --> 14:28.696
(CRYING)

14:31.036 --> 14:35.132
Maybe when I can see
a Iittle better.

14:35.941 --> 14:37.306
Okay.

14:39.111 --> 14:40.100
It's all right.

14:43.983 --> 14:45.951
I'm taking my client home now.

14:54.026 --> 14:55.516
Cut him Ioose.

14:56.662 --> 14:58.721
That son of a bitch
wins again.

15:06.705 --> 15:10.402
I'm on my way home
and this flaming shoe
hit the ground.

15:10.476 --> 15:12.910
I Iook up and here comes
the rest of her.

15:12.978 --> 15:14.605
Did you see
anyone else up there?

15:14.680 --> 15:16.944
No, man, I was busy
putting out the fire.

15:17.016 --> 15:20.042
Okay, thank you.
If you remember anything
else, give us a call.

15:20.119 --> 15:21.211
They wake you up, too?

15:21.287 --> 15:23.448
Yeah. I was just
Ieaving the office
when the call came in.

15:23.522 --> 15:26.457
I had the desk page you.
Girl on a rooftop.
I figured you'd want in.

15:26.525 --> 15:27.549
What's with fire?

15:27.626 --> 15:30.060
Perp Iit the victim up
before he threw her off.

15:30.129 --> 15:31.187
Who is she?

15:31.263 --> 15:33.163
Aisha Thompson, 14.

15:33.232 --> 15:35.427
Used to Iive about
two blocks away from here.

15:35.501 --> 15:39.335
Tosses her off a roof.
Leon's trying to send me
a message now?

15:39.538 --> 15:40.527
Hey.

15:40.606 --> 15:44.098
Full thickness burns
to the body, but she was
dead before he torched her.

15:44.176 --> 15:45.200
How?

15:45.277 --> 15:49.043
Ligature strangulation
after she performed
oral sex on him.

15:49.348 --> 15:52.146
We ran the Luma Light
around the scene,
she has fluids on her face.

15:52.217 --> 15:53.684
Leon Iives
a dozen blocks from here.

15:53.752 --> 15:55.583
THOMPSON: Where is she?
Where is she, man?

15:55.654 --> 15:58.088
Hold up.
Yo, she's my sister.

15:58.157 --> 16:00.091
Let him through.
Let him through.
Let him through.

16:00.159 --> 16:02.491
Didn't know you had a sister.

16:03.595 --> 16:07.258
Rodney. Rodney. Come on.
AII right.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.961
You know him?
He Iooks
just Iike his father.

16:17.609 --> 16:20.635
You used to come around
all the time
when I was a kid.

16:20.713 --> 16:23.113
You know, your parents and I
got busy with our Iives,

16:23.182 --> 16:25.582
fell out of touch
when I moved to Brooklyn.

16:26.051 --> 16:27.575
How they doing?

16:28.587 --> 16:33.456
Dad got hooked on dope,
disappeared,
and mom brought us up,

16:33.525 --> 16:36.494
but she died two years ago,
breast cancer,

16:36.562 --> 16:38.792
so it was just me and Aisha.

16:42.368 --> 16:44.893
I was out all night
Iooking for her.

16:48.140 --> 16:50.438
When did you realize
she was missing?

16:50.509 --> 16:52.875
She went to the Iibrary
to do a project for school,

16:52.945 --> 16:57.541
but when she didn't come home
by 10:00, I just started
calling her friends,

16:58.217 --> 16:59.946
but nobody saw her, so...

17:01.787 --> 17:05.450
Did she have a boyfriend?
Anybody paying
attention to her?

17:10.462 --> 17:13.829
Aisha told me everything,
okay.

17:14.532 --> 17:18.799
She just got accepted
to Stuyvesant. You know, that
school for the gifted kids?

17:27.146 --> 17:29.205
She was gonna be somebody.

17:34.820 --> 17:36.947
What are you gonna
do about this?

17:38.991 --> 17:42.927
We got a Iine on this guy.
We think we know who he is

17:43.262 --> 17:47.892
and we're gonna get him.
He's not gonna kill
any more girls.

17:51.804 --> 17:54.068
How does Fin know
the victim's family?

17:54.139 --> 17:56.630
He grew up with Rodney
and Aisha's mother.

17:56.708 --> 17:58.676
This has got Tate
written all over it.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.735
We need a warrant
for his apartment.

18:00.813 --> 18:02.144
CABOT: Do you have evidence
it was him?

18:02.214 --> 18:04.648
We believe he beat up
Shareen White
when he raped her.

18:04.716 --> 18:06.775
Maybe this time
he didn't wanna Ieave
any witnesses.

18:06.852 --> 18:08.342
It's not enough.
And he's missing

18:08.420 --> 18:11.651
and the victim fits Tate's
profile and she was raped
on that rooftop.

18:11.723 --> 18:14.920
And murdered and set on fire,
neither of which
Tate has ever done.

18:14.993 --> 18:17.621
We don't know everything
Leon Tate's done.

18:17.696 --> 18:19.994
Now, how are we doing
on getting his records
unsealed?

18:20.065 --> 18:21.828
Motion's in, but it's gonna
take some time.

18:21.900 --> 18:24.425
We don't have time.
We need the information now.

18:24.837 --> 18:27.965
Corporation counsel
would have prosecuted Tate
because he was a juvie.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.507
Maybe somebody there
remembers him.

18:33.512 --> 18:35.912
I keep my notes
on all my own cases.

18:35.981 --> 18:37.039
The day I start this job,

18:37.116 --> 18:40.745
they put that Iittle bastard's
overstuffed file
right on my desk.

18:40.819 --> 18:43.344
Our shrink pegged him
with anti-social
personality disorder.

18:43.422 --> 18:47.188
Yeah, well, that sounds mild
compared to the psych
evals I read back then.

18:47.259 --> 18:50.786
Said Iittle Leon
was a serial killer
in the making.

18:50.896 --> 18:52.056
Based on what?

18:52.131 --> 18:55.100
Based on his Iove
of torturing and killing
the neighbors' pets.

18:55.167 --> 18:57.863
Two when he was just seven,
and that's just for starters.

18:57.936 --> 18:59.403
FIN: What happened?

18:59.471 --> 19:02.304
Kiddie probation.
In other words, nothing.

19:02.374 --> 19:04.535
My Iuck I got a judge
sympathetic to the kid.

19:04.610 --> 19:06.237
His sheet says he was back
six months Iater.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.006
Hey, I argued
he should be put away,

19:08.080 --> 19:12.414
but Judge BIeeding Heart
wanted me to exhaust every
possible treatment option.

19:12.484 --> 19:15.453
Don't tell me, His Honor said
Leon could be rehabilitated?

19:15.521 --> 19:19.423
Until his Iast arrest,
which I handled
five years Iater.

19:19.625 --> 19:22.219
What made the judge
change his mind?

19:22.294 --> 19:26.321
Leon torched
the treatment facility.
Nobody else would touch him.

19:28.367 --> 19:29.891
Leon set fires?

19:31.537 --> 19:34.335
Nine out of his 11 collars
are for arson.

19:36.108 --> 19:39.271
The ACC who prosecuted says
Tate told the psychiatrists

19:39.344 --> 19:41.312
he killed puppies
to see what it felt Iike.

19:41.380 --> 19:42.506
Add the pyromania

19:42.581 --> 19:45.550
and Leon scores
two out of three
on the triad of sociopathy.

19:45.617 --> 19:47.346
Bed-wetting would make him
three for three.

19:47.419 --> 19:51.287
So Tate shows a reckless
disregard for Iife from
the time he was seven.

19:51.356 --> 19:54.348
And he had five years to
think about what he was gonna
do when he got out.

19:54.426 --> 19:56.519
So why didn't he kill
the first girl he seduced?

19:56.595 --> 19:59.689
HUANG: Rape is about anger,
but I'm not sure it's
the women that set him off.

19:59.765 --> 20:02.598
I think following him
might have made his anger
boil over.

20:02.668 --> 20:06.570
Oh, so Aisha Thompson's death
is our fault?

20:07.139 --> 20:10.438
Well, that's the way he's
gonna play it every time
he kills, until you find him.

20:10.509 --> 20:12.704
So we should have
just done nothing, right?

20:13.412 --> 20:15.539
I'm profiling,
I'm not accusing.

20:15.614 --> 20:17.138
CRAGEN: AII right,
where are we?

20:17.216 --> 20:20.117
Three shifts on Leon's crib
around the clock,
no sign of him.

20:20.185 --> 20:22.949
Tate have any friends
or relatives he might
be holed up with?

20:23.021 --> 20:25.546
His mother moved
from the address in his file.

20:25.624 --> 20:26.989
Nobody could tell us
where she went.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.789
AII right. Well, Iet's
just check his phone records
from prison.

20:29.861 --> 20:32.830
If you were away
for five years,
you'd call your mother, too.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.889
If he's not with her,
have his building canvassed.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.697
John, start pulling every rape
and sexual homicide of girls

20:37.769 --> 20:40.135
that fit the type Tate Iiked.
AII five boroughs.

20:40.205 --> 20:41.229
How far back?

20:41.306 --> 20:43.001
Let's start with 10 years.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.872
This guy is
serial killer material.

20:44.943 --> 20:48.003
He might have sweet-talked
a Iot more girls
than we know about.

20:51.650 --> 20:53.709
You come to take
another five years
from my son?

20:53.785 --> 20:55.878
When was the Iast time
you saw him?

20:55.954 --> 20:58.479
You should know,
the way you've been
following him around.

20:58.557 --> 20:59.819
Mrs. Tate,
when was the Iast time...

20:59.925 --> 21:04.453
You sent him to prison
because some 14-year-old
hussy told him she was 21.

21:04.997 --> 21:07.932
So it was her fault?
Girl never Ied you on?

21:08.166 --> 21:10.225
A girl was murdered
Iast night.

21:11.069 --> 21:14.971
He didn't kill anybody.
I told him to stay away
from those girls.

21:15.040 --> 21:16.667
Well, Leon's not taking
your advice,

21:16.742 --> 21:19.540
because he was with one
when I saw him two nights ago.

21:21.680 --> 21:24.205
I don't know
why he's the way he is.

21:25.083 --> 21:28.746
I tried to raise him right,
gave him plenty of Iove.

21:31.390 --> 21:33.255
Now he's got this HIV.

21:34.526 --> 21:36.653
I don't know what happened.

21:41.466 --> 21:43.229
Mrs. Tate,
if he contacts you...

21:43.302 --> 21:46.135
I'm afraid that he is
shooting dope again.

21:46.471 --> 21:48.336
Why do you think that?

21:48.840 --> 21:51.331
He said you were dogging him,

21:51.410 --> 21:54.470
and he wasn't sure
he could handle
going back to prison.

21:55.814 --> 21:59.375
Did he tell you that
when you saw him?
Last night.

22:07.492 --> 22:09.926
What do you want with me?
FIN: You seen Leon Tate?

22:09.995 --> 22:11.690
I mind my own business.

22:11.763 --> 22:14.698
Why don't you try
knocking on his door?
We did.

22:14.766 --> 22:16.131
Then I guess I can't help you.

22:16.201 --> 22:19.967
AII right. Well,
if you see him give me a call.

22:21.707 --> 22:23.174
Where to now?

22:23.508 --> 22:25.533
Well, Leon Iikes rooftops.

22:29.414 --> 22:32.440
Spent a Iot of time
on my rooftop
when I was a kid.

22:32.517 --> 22:34.417
It was safe back then.

22:34.486 --> 22:36.545
Doing the wild thing
with your girlfriend?

22:36.621 --> 22:39.146
You know, when you Iive here
you can't afford
a vacation to Aruba,

22:39.224 --> 22:42.216
so you went to
"Isle of Aroofa," tar beach.

22:42.961 --> 22:44.394
PIus the guys
Iike to come up here

22:44.463 --> 22:46.829
'cause this is where
the girls would come hang out.

22:49.167 --> 22:50.930
I grew up in Queens.

22:51.269 --> 22:53.999
AII I ever wanted
was the excitement
of the city.

22:54.072 --> 22:56.836
Sounds Iike
all you ever wanted was quiet.
We should've traded places.

22:56.908 --> 23:01.311
Large family in a
small apartment. I used to
come up here at night, too.

23:02.047 --> 23:05.949
Used to Iook at the view
and the Iights
in the distance, think.

23:07.586 --> 23:11.784
About the meaning of Iife?
That I had to get off
that rooftop.

23:14.960 --> 23:17.758
Well, well, Leon, I guess
you wanted to get off
the rooftop, too.

23:17.829 --> 23:18.989
Who you talking to?

23:19.064 --> 23:20.622
Check this out.

23:22.134 --> 23:23.499
It's Leon.

23:23.902 --> 23:25.767
Took a taste and OD'd.

23:26.471 --> 23:29.770
He could have been up here
since Iast night and nobody
would have seen him.

23:29.841 --> 23:32.173
ME says he's been
down at Ieast 18 hours,

23:32.244 --> 23:34.144
but he still could have
murdered Aisha Thompson.

23:34.212 --> 23:37.306
Guy OD's two weeks
out of prison.
Talk about bad karma.

23:37.382 --> 23:39.179
Well, maybe for Leon.

23:39.518 --> 23:42.214
For his potential victims
it's all upside.

23:42.354 --> 23:44.288
Yeah, thanks. Maybe not.

23:44.356 --> 23:45.550
FIN: What?

23:45.624 --> 23:47.854
Another rooftop, another body.

23:49.828 --> 23:52.695
Guy came up to feed
the pigeons, found her.

23:53.565 --> 23:55.624
Anybody else up here
besides him and the victim?

23:55.700 --> 23:57.292
Nobody.
Thanks.

23:57.602 --> 23:59.365
How old is this one, Doc?

23:59.438 --> 24:02.805
I'd say no more than 16.
Raped before she was killed.

24:02.874 --> 24:04.865
Any ID?
Nothing on her.

24:06.645 --> 24:09.170
Perp did a real number
on her face.

24:09.247 --> 24:10.908
With what?
Brick.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.808
Pieces of it
broke off in her skull.

24:14.252 --> 24:17.688
This was on her
right index finger.
May help ID her.

24:17.989 --> 24:20.321
Well, if it's Leon's work,
he's improvising.

24:20.392 --> 24:22.189
It couldn't
have been Leon Tate.

24:22.861 --> 24:24.260
What are you talking about?

24:24.329 --> 24:27.196
The victim's still in rigor.
Probably killed this morning.

24:27.332 --> 24:29.459
Tate was dead by Iast night.

24:32.904 --> 24:34.701
EIIiot...
I wanted it to be Leon.

24:34.773 --> 24:37.105
Everything fit.
We wasted time.

24:38.810 --> 24:41.779
Another girl's dead
because I went down
the wrong road.

24:46.418 --> 24:47.715
You happy now?

24:47.786 --> 24:49.344
Mrs. Tate,
I'm sorry about Leon.

24:49.421 --> 24:51.855
Don't you dare
say you're sorry.

24:52.624 --> 24:54.023
You're glad he's dead.

24:54.092 --> 24:57.220
He didn't kill those girls,
but you killed him anyway.

24:57.295 --> 24:58.956
You murdered him.

24:59.030 --> 25:02.124
Mrs. Tate, Detective Stabler
was doing his job.

25:02.734 --> 25:04.497
My son was innocent.

25:04.736 --> 25:07.671
Your son was gonna
kill somebody with his HIV.

25:07.739 --> 25:09.229
We had to stop him.

25:09.674 --> 25:12.905
We didn't put
the needle in his arm.
You didn't.

25:13.979 --> 25:16.447
But you all stick together,
don't you?

25:26.625 --> 25:27.853
Who's our victim?

25:27.926 --> 25:30.622
Tiffany Purcell, 14.
Mother ID'ed her ring.

25:33.164 --> 25:36.600
Fin, thanks for taking my back
with Mrs. Tate.

25:36.668 --> 25:37.794
Leon was scum.

25:37.869 --> 25:40.531
He was gonna kill
some innocent girl
if you didn't stop him.

25:43.842 --> 25:45.742
We're checking every parolee
in the Iast two years

25:45.810 --> 25:48.142
who was ever collared
for anything violent
against women.

25:48.213 --> 25:49.578
None of these m.o.'s
are the same.

25:49.648 --> 25:51.309
STABLER: The pattern's
in the victimology.

25:51.383 --> 25:55.843
AII the victims are black,
young, good students,
never been in trouble.

25:55.921 --> 25:57.855
This is no wild-eyed psycho.

25:57.923 --> 26:00.551
Your perp is most Iikely
well-educated, attractive.

26:00.625 --> 26:03.617
He seems trustworthy.
He has good social skills.

26:03.695 --> 26:07.187
Every time he cons a girl
into submission, he's proving
how much smarter he is.

26:07.265 --> 26:10.359
Okay, that could explain
why he changes Iocations
and m.o.'s.

26:10.435 --> 26:11.902
That's part of his strategy.

26:11.970 --> 26:15.201
He knew how much harder
it would be for you guys
to put his pattern together.

26:15.273 --> 26:18.606
He was right.
What about this victim
that he set on fire?

26:18.677 --> 26:21.475
Something about her
sent him over the edge.

26:21.546 --> 26:23.878
Maybe she
physically injured him

26:23.949 --> 26:26.713
or she said something
that would trigger
that Ievel of violence.

26:26.785 --> 26:28.252
You mean Iike challenging
his manhood?

26:28.320 --> 26:31.653
Any challenge
to his sense of control.
That's what this is all about.

26:31.723 --> 26:35.090
These men often have wives
or steady girlfriends
who are submissive.

26:35.160 --> 26:36.889
They seek
unconditional approval.

26:36.962 --> 26:39.089
Well, my old man
never approved
of a single thing I ever did.

26:39.164 --> 26:41.689
I don't go around raping
and killing young girls.

26:41.766 --> 26:46.169
This perp was told that he
was no good enough times
to think that it was true.

26:47.706 --> 26:52.643
AII any of these girls
has to say is "stop" and
that's Iikely to set him off.

26:53.812 --> 26:56.576
A rape and two murders
in one week tells me
we're on borrowed time

26:56.648 --> 26:58.047
before he kills again.

26:58.116 --> 27:01.313
Get all the
victims' descriptions
of the perp. Make a composite.

27:01.386 --> 27:03.047
We've got company.

27:04.022 --> 27:05.353
I'II take him.

27:07.325 --> 27:10.226
I thought you had him, man?
We were wrong.
We're gonna get him.

27:10.295 --> 27:11.523
You aren't doing
a damn thing, are you?

27:11.596 --> 27:13.496
What, 'cause it happened
north of 96th street?

27:13.565 --> 27:16.659
You can save that
for somebody else, okay?
I know your family.

27:16.735 --> 27:19.033
We're from the same place
and we're the same color.

27:23.174 --> 27:24.732
Fin.
What happened?

27:24.809 --> 27:26.276
Another girl.

27:30.582 --> 27:32.345
BENSON: What do we got, Doc?

27:33.051 --> 27:35.679
Cause of death
is Iigature strangulation.

27:35.754 --> 27:38.154
Some kind of thick shoelace,
maybe from a sneaker.

27:38.223 --> 27:39.713
Dead about 12 hours.

27:39.791 --> 27:40.883
Raped?

27:40.959 --> 27:42.859
And she put up a fight,
tried to resist.

27:42.927 --> 27:47.261
She's got finger-size bruises
on the inside of her thighs
where he pried her Iegs apart.

27:47.332 --> 27:48.697
This wacko's out of control.

27:48.767 --> 27:52.533
Well, I can't tell you
it's the same wacko
until I compare the DNA.

27:53.538 --> 27:56.837
I've known her
since she was a baby.
It's horrible.

27:57.142 --> 28:01.238
Tina was a sweet girl.
I try to keep
the building safe.

28:01.579 --> 28:03.547
What do you know
about Tina and her family?

28:03.615 --> 28:05.276
Her parents are nice,
responsible people.

28:05.350 --> 28:08.080
They're never Iate
with the rent, took care
of their apartment.

28:08.153 --> 28:12.249
Do they know?
Her mother does.
She's downstairs.

28:13.191 --> 28:16.319
Father sails on cargo ships.
They're trying
to reach him now.

28:16.394 --> 28:19.591
Did you see Tina Iast night?
Sorry.

28:20.331 --> 28:22.663
We're gonna need you
to take us down
to her apartment.

28:25.403 --> 28:29.669
I sent Tina to the store
on the corner
for some milk and bread.

28:31.242 --> 28:35.440
Do you remember what time?
Around 10:00 Iast night.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.780
We walked out together.

28:40.385 --> 28:43.843
I work graveyard
at the post office.

28:45.590 --> 28:47.785
This is gonna kill her daddy.

28:51.463 --> 28:53.727
Was she here
when you came home
this morning?

28:53.798 --> 28:57.632
I did a couple of hours
overtime. I assumed
Tina went to school.

29:00.038 --> 29:03.337
Does she ever have
any friends over
while you're at work?

29:03.408 --> 29:05.433
No, only when I'm here.

29:07.312 --> 29:10.907
How about boyfriends?
Tina is very shy around boys.

29:11.483 --> 29:13.542
She said some kid at school
had a crush on her.

29:13.618 --> 29:15.347
That's all I know about.

29:16.554 --> 29:18.954
Who would do
something Iike this?

29:24.095 --> 29:25.824
I'II be just a minute.

29:30.735 --> 29:33.329
Piece of paper in her room
had some numbers on it.

29:33.404 --> 29:35.235
I'II call them
and have someone
run them down.

29:35.306 --> 29:36.364
Her mother give you anything?

29:36.441 --> 29:39.376
Tina's Iast stop
was the corner store.

29:40.445 --> 29:44.006
CLERK:
Yeah, she did come in here.
I was getting ready to close.

29:44.182 --> 29:46.412
She come in with anybody?
No.

29:48.153 --> 29:51.486
Some guy
did come in behind her.
They started talking.

29:51.556 --> 29:52.818
This him?

29:53.725 --> 29:56.455
This guy had a shaved head
and no beard.

29:56.728 --> 29:59.925
You ever see him
in here before?
I just started
working here Iast week.

29:59.998 --> 30:01.090
What'd they talk about?

30:01.166 --> 30:03.896
I didn't hear,
but they was talking
and Iaughing and stuff

30:03.968 --> 30:07.233
Iike they knew each other.
They Ieft together, too.

30:08.039 --> 30:09.336
FIN: Thanks, man.
AII right.

30:10.508 --> 30:14.342
Shaved head? One of
my tenants just went for
the cue-ball Iook.

30:14.412 --> 30:18.143
Which one?
Malik Harris. 3B.
Shaved his beard, too.

30:18.216 --> 30:21.481
When?
Last few days.
Didn't even recognize him.

30:26.558 --> 30:28.025
MUNCH: Malik Harris?

30:28.426 --> 30:32.487
That's what it says on my
birth certificate, but I'm
known professionally as King.

30:32.564 --> 30:35.727
We wanna talk to you, Malik.
You gonna invite us in?

30:35.800 --> 30:37.290
Now is not a convenient time.

30:37.368 --> 30:40.360
TANYA: Who's there, baby?
Nobody that concerns you.

30:40.505 --> 30:42.132
I guess we're interrupting.

30:49.214 --> 30:51.079
I told you I was busy.

30:52.150 --> 30:53.378
Sweetie.

30:54.819 --> 30:56.252
Baby, I was just wondering...

30:56.321 --> 30:58.789
You see I'm speaking
to these officers?

31:03.695 --> 31:04.855
What do you want?

31:04.929 --> 31:06.897
Are you aware
of what's going on upstairs?

31:07.532 --> 31:09.625
I haven't been out,
enlighten me.

31:09.701 --> 31:11.566
A girl was murdered
on the rooftop.

31:11.636 --> 31:14.264
Who?
Tina Dupree. You know her?

31:15.240 --> 31:17.470
Yeah, I seen her around. Damn.

31:17.642 --> 31:19.576
MUNCH: Somebody saw you
with her Iast night.

31:19.944 --> 31:22.310
On the corner at the store.
I walked her home.

31:22.380 --> 31:24.245
Little girl Iike that
shouldn't be out so Iate.

31:24.315 --> 31:26.408
Can you tell us where you were
the rest of the night?

31:27.685 --> 31:30.586
Baby, now you may dialogue.

31:32.257 --> 31:34.418
We ain't Ieft the apartment.

31:34.492 --> 31:37.188
We been busy.
You know what I am saying?

31:39.330 --> 31:41.924
"Baby, now you may
dialogue"? PIease.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.991
He was the Iast person
to see her.

31:44.068 --> 31:47.162
Pretty big risk
if he's our serial killer,
striking where he Iives.

31:47.238 --> 31:49.331
Unless Tina was a victim
of opportunity.

31:49.407 --> 31:53.070
Harris goes to the store,
sees her, walks her home,

31:53.144 --> 31:55.544
knows her mother
works at night,
father's out of town.

31:55.613 --> 31:58.104
Yeah, police just putting on
a big show for us, that's all.

31:58.182 --> 31:59.547
Just what we need.

31:59.617 --> 32:02.211
I got this. You got a problem?

32:02.287 --> 32:05.051
Yeah, that you cops
don't give a rat's ass
what's going on up here.

32:05.123 --> 32:08.354
You don't think so?
Well, we're here.
You know who's not here?

32:08.426 --> 32:10.189
The press, the TV news.

32:10.261 --> 32:12.661
If you got any beef,
you got beef with them,
not us.

32:12.730 --> 32:15.858
They can't make money off us.
They don't care. Word up.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.664
Don't tell me. Tell them.
Why don't y'all give them
a call, all right?

32:18.736 --> 32:22.934
Meanwhile, does anybody have
any information
that could help us?

32:25.009 --> 32:29.946
Okay, people, please go back
to your business,
and Iet us do our job.

32:31.015 --> 32:32.243
Not you.

32:32.417 --> 32:35.818
Why do you wanna make this
harder on yourself
than it already is?

32:36.521 --> 32:40.423
Aisha was all I had Ieft,
all right? Now some scum
took her away,

32:40.491 --> 32:42.823
and I'm supposed to stand here
and watch you not catch him?

32:44.062 --> 32:45.654
What's harder than that, man?

32:51.502 --> 32:53.936
Checked the phone numbers
we found
in Tina Dupree's room.

32:54.005 --> 32:56.974
One belongs to a girlfriend.
The other, Malik Harris.

32:57.041 --> 32:58.133
Harris have a rap sheet?

32:58.209 --> 33:01.406
Never arrested, but came up
on the computer as a victim
of vehicular assault.

33:01.479 --> 33:04.243
Hit by a car in '94.
Right after the third murder.

33:04.315 --> 33:06.146
His Iegs were shattered,
almost Iost them.

33:06.217 --> 33:07.878
Hospitalized in rehab
for nearly a year,

33:07.952 --> 33:09.715
spent the next two Iearning
how to walk again.

33:09.787 --> 33:12.278
So Harris
was only out of action
for three years.

33:12.357 --> 33:13.449
Our perp waited seven.

33:13.524 --> 33:17.187
He gets
social security disability.
From '97 to Iast year,

33:17.261 --> 33:19.491
his checks were sent
to an address in Detroit.

33:19.564 --> 33:20.826
Harris has a sister
who Iives there.

33:20.898 --> 33:24.163
Get Detroit Homicide
on the phone, see if they
have any unsolved killings

33:24.235 --> 33:28.103
matching our victim profiles.
Fin, my office, now.

33:32.176 --> 33:33.302
I just got off the phone

33:33.378 --> 33:35.744
with the Deputy Commissioner
for public information.

33:35.813 --> 33:36.905
Now, he wants to know

33:36.981 --> 33:39.643
why one of my detectives
is bad-mouthing the media
up in Harlem.

33:39.717 --> 33:40.877
I was just telling them
the truth.

33:40.952 --> 33:43.614
What the hell
were you thinking?
That those people were right.

33:43.688 --> 33:45.383
That's not your
judgment to make.

33:45.456 --> 33:47.924
If these girls were
murdered in the Village
or the Upper West Side,

33:47.992 --> 33:49.425
the media would be
all over it.

33:49.494 --> 33:51.724
1PP would issue a task force.

33:52.130 --> 33:54.690
Five black girls
aren't even on their radar.

33:55.266 --> 33:57.427
Are you finished?
No, I'm just getting started.

33:57.502 --> 33:59.732
This is no different
than any other investigation.

33:59.804 --> 34:03.900
No? An East
Side socialite disappears,
we got 50 cops on it.

34:04.342 --> 34:07.311
BIack girls
start getting executed,
we got four cops.

34:07.378 --> 34:09.175
That sounds equal to you?

34:09.614 --> 34:13.050
Look, I know
where you're coming from.
No, you don't know
where I'm coming from.

34:13.117 --> 34:14.982
There's no way you can know
where I'm coming from.

34:15.053 --> 34:16.918
Don't you dare presume to know
what's in my head.

34:16.987 --> 34:18.284
No matter what you say,
Captain,

34:18.356 --> 34:21.085
you're not black
and you're not from the hood.

34:33.971 --> 34:35.063
SIow down.

34:35.139 --> 34:37.300
That crowd
could have turned ugly.
I diffused it.

34:37.375 --> 34:39.570
Cragen didn't know that.
Who you defending? Him or me?

34:39.643 --> 34:42.340
Both of you.
Just take a deep breath.
No time for that.

34:42.413 --> 34:43.710
Where are we going?

34:44.649 --> 34:47.117
I'm going to meet
an informant. AIone.

34:49.353 --> 34:51.321
FIN: I'm busy.
This better be good.

34:51.422 --> 34:53.117
BENNY:
How about a Iittle respect.

34:53.291 --> 34:56.158
Time is money,
and I'm Iosing it
talking to you.

34:56.226 --> 34:58.787
What the hell are you doing
back there? Sit up Iike a man.

34:58.863 --> 34:59.955
Yeah, I get seen with you,

35:00.031 --> 35:02.932
my customers go elsewhere
for their merchandise.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.160
You got something
for me, Benny,

35:04.235 --> 35:05.998
or did you just come here
to run your mouth?

35:06.070 --> 35:09.039
Word's out you're Iooking
to jam up King.
Where you hear that?

35:09.107 --> 35:11.132
I got sources just Iike you.

35:11.209 --> 35:15.009
What do your sources
know about him?
That King's a
rap promoter wannabe.

35:15.079 --> 35:18.571
Manages a few unknowns,
but doesn't have
the goods to make it big.

35:18.649 --> 35:21.482
He uses the rap Iine
mostly to pick up women.

35:21.552 --> 35:23.520
So far you're boring me.

35:23.754 --> 35:27.884
How about he buys his coke
and dope from one of
my corner boys?

35:29.227 --> 35:31.957
Now you're talking.
Where's he get his cash?

35:32.029 --> 35:33.690
King's a kept man.

35:33.898 --> 35:37.129
Smooth-talks one of his Iadies
into paying for his Iifestyle,

35:37.235 --> 35:39.635
till they wise up, dump him.

35:41.072 --> 35:44.269
What's in this for you,
Benny?
I don't Iike him.

35:45.576 --> 35:47.441
Consider it a freebie.

35:50.715 --> 35:52.580
Harris admits to walking
Tina Dupree home,

35:52.650 --> 35:54.550
and we got witnesses
that saw them together.

35:54.619 --> 35:55.916
That doesn't mean
he killed her.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.545
We took the composites
from all the rapes

35:57.622 --> 36:00.216
and had the artist
remove the hair.
That's Malik Harris dead-on.

36:00.291 --> 36:02.657
A judge isn't going to give us
a search warrant
based on that.

36:02.727 --> 36:05.696
What about a Iineup?
We risk tipping our hand.

36:05.763 --> 36:08.391
I got an informant,
a drug dealer I busted
a few years ago.

36:08.466 --> 36:12.300
He says his boys sell
Malik Harris dope and coke
on a regular basis.

36:12.370 --> 36:13.928
Well, write the warrant
for the drugs only.

36:14.005 --> 36:15.495
That'II allow you to search
almost everywhere.

36:15.573 --> 36:17.564

on top of that is gravy.

I can't talk to you right now.
I'm cutting a track here.

36:35.626 --> 36:37.924
Yeah, maybe you should be
recording jailhouse rock.

36:37.995 --> 36:39.895
Man, what are you
talking about?
You're under arrest.

36:39.964 --> 36:42.296
For what?
Possession of narcotics
in the third degree.

36:42.366 --> 36:44.459
What?
We tossed your crib.

36:44.835 --> 36:47.167
What you gonna do?
Make her a star
and then kill her, too?

36:48.239 --> 36:49.763
What is up with that?

36:50.274 --> 36:54.370
You're putting me through
all of this for some
recreational pharmaceuticals?

36:54.445 --> 36:58.677
You Iike big words, King?
How about execution
or Iethal injection?

36:58.749 --> 37:00.273
What, you gonna give me
the death penalty

37:00.351 --> 37:02.080

and heroin?

37:02.653 --> 37:04.678
Your handiwork. Remember?

37:07.858 --> 37:09.223
Poor girls.

37:09.360 --> 37:11.521
And you think that I
have something to do
with killing them?

37:11.596 --> 37:14.622
You were the Iast one
with Tina before she was
found dead.

37:15.066 --> 37:16.658
Feel free to dialogue.

37:17.134 --> 37:21.628
I told you I walked her home.
Anything after that
I'm not accountable for.

37:21.973 --> 37:23.804
And, of course,
you've met my Iovely alibi.

37:23.874 --> 37:26.001

once you doped her up.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.567
I am innocent.

37:27.712 --> 37:30.112
Then you won't mind
taking a Iittle trip with us.

37:33.451 --> 37:35.510
Open wide, please.
This'II only take a moment.

37:35.586 --> 37:38.020
What are you doing?
Just taking
a Iittle DNA sample

37:38.089 --> 37:39.249

37:39.323 --> 37:42.417
I can't allow that.
You got something to hide?

37:42.493 --> 37:45.690
It violates
my religious tenets.
I'm a Jehovah's Witness.

He doesn't have to.
He says it,
I can't take the sample.

We haven't been
properly introduced.

37:53.004 --> 37:55.802

sometime under circumstances
more conducive.

You fill in the blanks.

37:58.643 --> 37:59.837

Your thoughts
aren't very religious.

Most people secrete oils
right onto the Ienses.

38:27.238 --> 38:29.832
The cells I found
that were usable
were on the nose pieces.

38:30.641 --> 38:32.404
So what's the verdict?

38:32.476 --> 38:37.436
His Majesty's DNA is a match
on all six murders
and eight rapes.

38:38.616 --> 38:40.413
Got him.
Thanks.

38:43.254 --> 38:45.313
CABOT: This motion to suppress
is totally without merit.

38:45.389 --> 38:48.756
Malik Harris's right
to genetic privacy
was violated.

38:49.860 --> 38:53.125
The police have gotten DNA
off of coffee cups,
Iipstick, telephones,

38:53.197 --> 38:56.826
even a suspect's spit
on the street.
AII of it upheld in court.

38:56.901 --> 38:59.893
People discard coffee cups
and spit voluntarily.

38:59.970 --> 39:03.565
Detective Tutuola
assaulted my client
and stole his glasses.

39:03.641 --> 39:07.042
When Mr. Harris's sunglasses
fell, he demanded
the detectives replace them.

39:07.111 --> 39:09.011
He discarded them,
which makes them fair game.

39:09.080 --> 39:11.844
So what we're saying here
is that the police,
at any time,

39:11.916 --> 39:14.077
can obtain a person's
genetic code?

39:14.151 --> 39:16.676
The DNA obtained by the police
conclusively Iinks
the defendant

39:16.754 --> 39:18.654
to the murders
of a half a dozen
teenage girls.

39:18.723 --> 39:19.951
What about their rights?

39:20.024 --> 39:22.822
Mr. Harris's guilt
or innocence
isn't the issue here.

39:23.027 --> 39:25.552
How the police gathered
the evidence is.

39:25.629 --> 39:27.824
Your Honor,
reasonable deception
on the part of the police

39:27.898 --> 39:29.388
has been upheld
by the Supreme Court.

39:29.467 --> 39:33.801
Yes, and if the police
had tricked Mr. Harris
into giving up his sunglasses,

39:33.871 --> 39:35.338
we'd be out of here.

39:35.406 --> 39:40.105
They forced him,
that's coercion,
the DNA is out.

39:41.178 --> 39:44.773
The DNA is all the police have
tying my client
to these murders.

39:47.618 --> 39:50.985
Then I have no other choice
but to drop the charges
against Mr. Harris.

39:51.055 --> 39:54.855
And when your detectives blame
the judge, tell them that
they're the ones that blew it.

39:56.927 --> 40:00.226
No, no, no.
We didn't screw up.
We got Harris off the street.

40:00.297 --> 40:01.821

40:01.899 --> 40:04.163
What did you expect?
A Iittle justice.

40:04.235 --> 40:05.634

should have done better.

We got you all the evidence
you needed.

40:07.171 --> 40:09.162
If you'd done it Iegally,
this wouldn't have happened.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.606
AII right, come on. This isn't
getting us anywhere.

40:11.675 --> 40:12.835
What do we have Ieft?

40:12.910 --> 40:15.606
Possession three
on the drugs that we found
in his apartment.

40:15.679 --> 40:17.977
Is there anything
we can do with that
to keep him off the street?

40:18.048 --> 40:20.881
First offense,
Harris'II make bail.
Just gonna give up?

40:20.951 --> 40:23.579
I will ask for remand,
but the judge
will never go for it.

40:23.654 --> 40:25.019

mention the murders.

that we...
