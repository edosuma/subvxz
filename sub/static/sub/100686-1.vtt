00:25.885 --> 00:29.452
<i>"Beware of
the Jabberwock, my son.</i>

00:29.454 --> 00:31.621
"The jaws that bite,

00:31.623 --> 00:33.556
"the claws that catch!

00:33.558 --> 00:35.358
"Beware the Jubjub bird

00:35.360 --> 00:37.596
"and shun
the frumious Bandersnatch.

00:39.331 --> 00:40.965
"He took his vorpal sword
in hand

00:40.967 --> 00:43.000
"Long time the manxome foe
he sought.

00:43.002 --> 00:45.435
"The Jabberwock,
with eyes of flame

00:45.437 --> 00:47.339
"Came whiffling through
the tulgey wood."

00:49.608 --> 00:51.341
Oh, hi, Rachel.

00:51.343 --> 00:53.443
Mom wants Angela
to get ready for bed,

00:53.445 --> 00:55.614
and she says it's time
for Charles to go home.

01:01.821 --> 01:03.188
Go brush your teeth, Angela.

01:06.458 --> 01:08.291
It's just a book.

01:08.293 --> 01:10.495
People don't actually
go through mirrors.

01:11.631 --> 01:13.496
Here, play a song
on your music box,

01:13.498 --> 01:14.634
it will make you feel better.

01:47.466 --> 01:48.868
So, I was thinking,

01:49.836 --> 01:51.769
my dad said I could...

01:51.771 --> 01:53.371
borrow a car
from the dealership.

01:57.810 --> 02:00.780
There's this place
that people go to.

02:02.514 --> 02:04.614
And what would we do?

02:04.616 --> 02:06.518
Um...

02:28.607 --> 02:29.874
Angela?

02:29.876 --> 02:31.374
Are you almost done
in there?

02:42.021 --> 02:43.687
Angela?

02:54.901 --> 02:57.567
Angela!
What is it?

04:17.083 --> 04:19.584
This doesn't look so bad,
does it?

04:41.107 --> 04:42.740
I'm not sure
what's going on.

04:42.742 --> 04:43.874
I spoke to your aunt

04:43.876 --> 04:45.042
just two two days ago
and told her

04:45.044 --> 04:46.542
we'd be here this morning.

04:46.544 --> 04:48.178
Is this normal for her?

04:48.180 --> 04:49.947
We don't know.

04:49.949 --> 04:52.149
I don't know what we're going
to do if she's not here.

04:52.151 --> 04:54.754
We could go back home.

04:55.187 --> 04:57.121
Hello!

04:57.123 --> 04:59.089
I'm Charles,
I'm a friend of Beth's.

04:59.091 --> 05:01.258
I live down the road.
I was supposed to be here

05:01.260 --> 05:03.861
when you arrived,
but overslept. I'm sorry.

05:03.863 --> 05:05.195
It's all right.

05:05.197 --> 05:07.597
You must be Olivia and Claire.

05:07.599 --> 05:08.999
Is their aunt home?

05:09.001 --> 05:10.134
She should be.

05:10.136 --> 05:11.669
I was knocking and...

05:11.671 --> 05:13.906
Well, she's a little slow
getting around.

05:14.539 --> 05:16.106
She's, uh...

05:16.108 --> 05:17.209
not well.

05:18.811 --> 05:19.743
Oh.

05:19.745 --> 05:22.447
But let's go inside,
and we'll find her.

05:23.149 --> 05:24.150
Come on.

05:29.055 --> 05:30.754
You've got Olivia here.

05:30.756 --> 05:31.889
It's gonna be okay.

05:31.891 --> 05:33.523
It should only be
a few days.

05:33.525 --> 05:34.694
We're going to find your dad.

05:35.294 --> 05:36.494
Just a few days.

05:37.029 --> 05:38.030
Okay?

05:44.170 --> 05:45.738
It's all right, Claire bear.

05:46.538 --> 05:48.072
Everything's going
to be all right.

05:50.542 --> 05:51.911
We're together.

06:03.322 --> 06:04.857
Hi, you must be Beth.

06:18.570 --> 06:19.739
Excuse me.

06:28.180 --> 06:30.016
I'm sorry,
is everything all right?

06:30.615 --> 06:32.018
I don't want them here.

06:33.786 --> 06:34.787
What?

06:36.789 --> 06:37.823
What I mean is...

06:39.759 --> 06:41.660
I think it would be best
if you took them.

06:42.762 --> 06:44.194
Yes, um...

06:44.196 --> 06:46.363
that's not possible.

06:46.365 --> 06:48.832
I thought I explained all this
to you on the phone.

06:48.834 --> 06:50.302
Uh, who are you again?

06:51.237 --> 06:53.037
Camilla Clark.

06:53.039 --> 06:54.572
I worked with their mother.

06:55.775 --> 06:57.875
Is there
some sort of problem,

06:57.877 --> 06:59.643
- because when we talked...
- The problem is,

06:59.645 --> 07:01.947
I don't normally
entertain visitors.

07:02.815 --> 07:04.582
They're not just visitors,

07:05.384 --> 07:07.251
they're your nieces.

07:07.253 --> 07:08.754
Their mother's just died.

07:09.789 --> 07:10.923
Your own sister.

07:12.324 --> 07:14.992
My husband and I are moving
clear across the country

07:14.994 --> 07:16.360
in a matter of days.

07:16.362 --> 07:17.593
All of our things are packed.

07:17.595 --> 07:20.664
We can't take them with us.
Not under these circumstances.

07:20.666 --> 07:22.032
What about their father?

07:22.034 --> 07:24.168
He's working out of
the country somewhere,

07:24.170 --> 07:26.036
we haven't been able
to reach him.

07:26.038 --> 07:29.075
I guess he and Rachel have been
divorced for some time?

07:29.775 --> 07:31.308
I wouldn't know.

07:31.310 --> 07:33.343
We've been trying
to contact him,

07:33.345 --> 07:36.115
but we just haven't been
able to yet.

07:36.982 --> 07:38.982
I'm sure as soon as we do,

07:38.984 --> 07:41.952
he'll want to come straight
back to collect the girls.

07:41.954 --> 07:43.821
In the meantime,

07:43.823 --> 07:46.156
considering all
they've been through,

07:46.158 --> 07:48.158
I really think
the best thing for them

07:48.160 --> 07:49.962
is to be with family.

08:09.048 --> 08:10.249
Don't mind your aunt.

08:11.851 --> 08:13.750
She acts a little...

08:13.752 --> 08:16.155
different sometimes,
but she means well.

08:20.926 --> 08:23.229
She's a very
extraordinary person...

08:28.167 --> 08:30.169
But she's been through
a lot in her life.

08:31.770 --> 08:33.437
We should form a club.

08:33.439 --> 08:35.739
Well, girls,

08:35.741 --> 08:36.942
I'm afraid
I have to be going.

08:42.081 --> 08:44.381
Your father will be here
soon, I'm sure.

08:44.383 --> 08:45.816
And in the meantime,

08:45.818 --> 08:48.785
if you girls need anything,
anything at all,

08:48.787 --> 08:50.053
don't hesitate to call.

08:50.055 --> 08:51.090
Okay?

08:55.227 --> 08:56.395
I'll let myself out.

09:01.734 --> 09:02.768
Goodbye.

09:14.947 --> 09:16.782
This is your
Aunt Angela's room.

09:17.850 --> 09:18.984
The one who died?

09:20.286 --> 09:22.119
Unless you have
another Aunt Angela

09:22.121 --> 09:23.689
no one's told me about.

09:25.357 --> 09:27.124
It's the only other room
in the house

09:27.126 --> 09:29.393
with a bed in it
at the moment.

09:29.395 --> 09:30.863
So, you'll have to share.

09:36.402 --> 09:38.204
I didn't want you
to come here.

09:39.205 --> 09:41.405
And by your expressions...

09:41.407 --> 09:44.009
I can only gather
that the feeling is mutual.

09:45.978 --> 09:49.179
But you're here,
and while you are,

09:49.181 --> 09:50.983
there are some rules
you'll need to follow.

09:54.186 --> 09:57.221
No one in the kitchen
between mealtimes,

09:57.223 --> 09:59.389
everyone in your rooms
by 10:00,

09:59.391 --> 10:01.124
lights out by 11:00.

10:01.126 --> 10:02.359
There's an elevator there,

10:02.361 --> 10:04.228
but it's broken
and dangerous.

10:04.230 --> 10:05.796
Stay out of it.

10:05.798 --> 10:08.532
There is a bathroom
adjacent to your room,

10:08.534 --> 10:10.500
so there should be no reason

10:10.502 --> 10:12.338
for anyone to come out
until morning.

10:13.372 --> 10:15.241
That is my study.

10:16.508 --> 10:19.078
No one is to go in there.

10:21.480 --> 10:23.480
This door leads
to the basement.

10:23.482 --> 10:25.515
It stays locked at all times.

10:25.517 --> 10:27.084
Why?

10:27.086 --> 10:29.853
Because the basement
has rats.

10:29.855 --> 10:30.990
Any more questions?

10:45.871 --> 10:49.072
This... is the dining room.

10:49.074 --> 10:51.408
The kitchen is just there.

10:51.410 --> 10:53.343
If you hear any noises
in the night,

10:53.345 --> 10:55.078
ignore them.

10:55.080 --> 10:56.480
It's an old house,

10:56.482 --> 10:58.849
and besides,
I have a tendency to sleepwalk,

10:58.851 --> 11:00.317
so it's probably just me

11:00.319 --> 11:02.788
bumping into something
or knocking it over.

11:04.390 --> 11:06.990
If I see either of you

11:06.992 --> 11:09.593
wandering the house
after hours,

11:09.595 --> 11:11.263
there will be consequences.

11:12.131 --> 11:14.266
Are all those rules clear?

11:15.167 --> 11:16.168
Yes.

11:23.442 --> 11:24.608
Claire,

11:24.610 --> 11:28.080
do you mind asking Lucy B
if she understands the rules?

11:35.187 --> 11:36.288
She says she does.

11:39.525 --> 11:40.658
Since the accident,

11:40.660 --> 11:43.293
she doesn't like
to talk to strangers.

11:43.295 --> 11:45.095
The doctors say
it's perfectly normal

11:45.097 --> 11:46.530
for a girl her age
who's been through...

11:46.532 --> 11:48.365
It's a weakness.

11:48.367 --> 11:50.436
And weakness is not good.

11:58.043 --> 12:00.510
Well, I have some work to do.

12:00.512 --> 12:03.580
I assume you girls
can entertain yourselves

12:03.582 --> 12:05.017
until dinnertime?

12:06.151 --> 12:07.353
Good.

13:15.020 --> 13:16.021
Oh, hello.

13:17.122 --> 13:18.457
I was just looking around.

13:18.858 --> 13:20.225
No, it's fine.

13:25.698 --> 13:27.230
What are you doing?

13:27.232 --> 13:28.567
Planting some flowers.

13:29.501 --> 13:30.502
Pansies.

13:32.604 --> 13:34.206
You could eat these,
you know.

13:40.279 --> 13:41.578
Do you live here?

13:41.580 --> 13:43.013
No.

13:43.015 --> 13:44.414
But, uh...

13:44.416 --> 13:45.615
I do come over a lot,

13:45.617 --> 13:47.217
to help out with things.

13:47.219 --> 13:48.418
Like gardening?

13:48.420 --> 13:50.220
Yes.

13:50.222 --> 13:53.624
I suppose I enjoy
participating in the...

13:53.626 --> 13:56.629
miracle of creating new life
in some small way.

13:58.030 --> 14:01.598
And I never had
any children of my own,

14:01.600 --> 14:03.467
so I guess in a small way,

14:03.469 --> 14:05.602
I look on these
little flowers

14:05.604 --> 14:07.204
as my children.

14:07.206 --> 14:08.806
You might want to
get ready for dinner.

14:08.808 --> 14:10.108
We'll be eating soon.

14:11.644 --> 14:12.679
Okay.

14:30.128 --> 14:31.263
Hope you girls like this.

14:32.030 --> 14:34.431
It's actually
an African recipe.

14:34.433 --> 14:35.833
Don't worry.
There's nothing strange in it,

14:35.835 --> 14:38.335
it's mostly just chicken
and vegetables.

14:38.337 --> 14:40.504
Your Aunt Beth would live
on toast and tea

14:40.506 --> 14:41.507
if left to herself.

14:42.608 --> 14:43.743
Well, bon appetit.

14:45.712 --> 14:47.544
We're honored you could
tear yourself away

14:47.546 --> 14:49.379
from your work
long enough to join us.

14:50.616 --> 14:51.816
What is this?

14:51.818 --> 14:53.751
It's that African stew.

14:53.753 --> 14:55.020
You'll like it.

14:59.391 --> 15:00.592
I got you something.

15:02.629 --> 15:03.761
They had it.

15:03.763 --> 15:04.797
They did.

15:05.698 --> 15:06.733
What's that?

15:07.466 --> 15:08.467
A book.

15:10.135 --> 15:12.369
A late Coptic necromancy.

15:12.371 --> 15:14.406
On the history,
it's a book on...

15:14.707 --> 15:15.808
history.

15:17.376 --> 15:19.746
So, what do you girls
like to do for fun?

15:20.445 --> 15:21.547
I don't know...

15:21.881 --> 15:23.213
Stuff.

15:23.215 --> 15:24.283
"Stuff"?

15:24.784 --> 15:26.616
I enjoy stuff.

15:26.618 --> 15:28.653
Maybe once you're
settled in, we can...

15:28.655 --> 15:30.487
find some fun stuff to do.

15:30.489 --> 15:32.622
They're not going
to be here that long.

15:32.624 --> 15:34.257
I know that.
But that doesn't mean

15:34.259 --> 15:36.361
that while they're here
they can't have a good time.

15:40.432 --> 15:41.431
So...

15:41.433 --> 15:43.502
you two have known each
other for a long time?

15:44.570 --> 15:46.169
Since we were kids.

15:46.171 --> 15:47.905
Younger than you.

15:47.907 --> 15:51.076
Yup. Everyone knew about
the Molnars around here.

15:51.811 --> 15:53.278
Especially your Aunt Beth.

15:53.813 --> 15:55.145
Why is that?

15:55.147 --> 15:56.413
Because your Aunt Beth

15:56.415 --> 15:59.384
won a very prestigious
violin competition.

15:59.752 --> 16:00.818
Really?

16:00.820 --> 16:02.319
When she was only ten.

16:02.321 --> 16:03.587
Is that true?

16:03.589 --> 16:04.722
He talks too much.

16:04.724 --> 16:07.092
It's absolutely true
and she knows it.

16:08.293 --> 16:09.629
Claire, you haven't
eaten anything.

16:10.495 --> 16:11.530
You better eat.

16:12.065 --> 16:13.731
Lucy B would like this.

16:13.733 --> 16:14.734
It has carrots.

16:18.503 --> 16:19.504
Come on.

16:26.612 --> 16:28.213
See? It isn't too bad.

16:38.758 --> 16:40.323
What's in this?

16:40.325 --> 16:42.325
Chicken, vegetables,
some spices...

16:42.327 --> 16:44.529
I use a little peanut butter
to thicken the sauce.

16:44.831 --> 16:46.465
Why? Why?

16:46.699 --> 16:48.398
Why?

16:54.339 --> 16:55.205
Olivia?

16:55.207 --> 16:57.374
Claire, breathe. Breathe.

16:57.376 --> 16:59.242
Claire. Claire, breathe.

16:59.244 --> 17:00.945
Claire, breathe.
Claire, breathe.

17:00.947 --> 17:02.379
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.

17:02.381 --> 17:03.615
- What do we do? What do we do?
- Move!

17:07.854 --> 17:09.787
She gonna be all right?

17:09.789 --> 17:12.857
I should have told you
she has a severe peanut allergy.

17:12.859 --> 17:14.326
I'm so sorry.

19:22.387 --> 19:23.455
<i>Listen to me.</i>

19:25.091 --> 19:27.958
<i>Come here. Hear me.
Listen to me.</i>

19:27.960 --> 19:29.061
<i>Listen to me.</i>

19:32.430 --> 19:33.563
<i>Come to the basement.</i>

19:33.565 --> 19:34.765
What?

19:34.767 --> 19:36.636
<i>Come to the basement.</i>

19:37.435 --> 19:38.803
I can't.

19:38.805 --> 19:40.840
Aunt Beth told us
not to go in there.

19:41.774 --> 19:43.943
<i>Go help Mommy, Claire.</i>

19:44.210 --> 19:45.645
Mommy?

19:47.412 --> 19:48.611
My mommy?

19:48.613 --> 19:49.782
<i>Go to the basement.</i>

19:50.650 --> 19:51.816
<i>Go to the basement.</i>

19:51.818 --> 19:53.351
How? It's locked.

19:54.086 --> 19:55.922
<i>I know where the key is.</i>

20:59.018 --> 21:00.385
Hmm?

21:05.691 --> 21:07.392
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

21:08.060 --> 21:09.929
<i>I'm here with you.</i>

21:21.707 --> 21:23.774
<i>Move the piece on the side</i>

21:23.776 --> 21:26.078
<i>and slide the top off.</i>

21:29.916 --> 21:31.949
<i>Slide it down
and then the top will open.</i>

21:45.497 --> 21:47.199
<i>Yes...</i>

22:23.002 --> 22:24.868
I don't want to.

22:24.870 --> 22:26.303
<i>It's okay.</i>

24:03.135 --> 24:04.303
Mommy...

24:06.939 --> 24:07.973
Is that you?

24:12.912 --> 24:13.979
Where are you?

25:07.933 --> 25:09.001
How?

25:20.713 --> 25:21.914
Then can I see you?

25:47.473 --> 25:50.307
"Mirror, mirror, open wide,

25:50.309 --> 25:52.042
"let the spirit come inside."

25:54.113 --> 25:56.914
"Mirror, mirror, open wide,

25:56.916 --> 25:58.382
"let the spirit come inside."

26:06.425 --> 26:08.859
"Mirror, mirror, open wide,

26:08.861 --> 26:10.360
"let the spirit come inside."

26:11.931 --> 26:12.932
Mommy?

26:20.206 --> 26:21.273
Mommy?

26:47.866 --> 26:48.934
Claire?

27:04.383 --> 27:05.517
Claire?

27:45.257 --> 27:46.456
Claire?

27:46.458 --> 27:47.559
What are you doing?

27:47.860 --> 27:49.126
Hiding.

27:49.128 --> 27:50.427
From what?

27:50.429 --> 27:51.430
From Aunt Beth.

27:52.331 --> 27:54.064
She wants to hurt me.

27:54.066 --> 27:55.299
What are you talking about?

27:55.301 --> 27:57.069
Aunt Beth
doesn't want to hurt you.

27:57.369 --> 27:58.437
Come on.

28:06.078 --> 28:07.079
Please.

28:07.913 --> 28:09.214
Don't let her get me.

28:10.249 --> 28:12.217
Nobody wants
to get you, Claire.

28:14.620 --> 28:16.055
I'll show you.

28:29.301 --> 28:31.370
We can't go in there.

28:48.454 --> 28:50.089
What are you doing?

29:08.507 --> 29:09.875
Here it is.

29:15.514 --> 29:18.217
This must be
what I saw in the mirror.

29:20.452 --> 29:22.285
How did you know about this?

29:22.287 --> 29:24.089
Mom told me.

29:52.985 --> 29:56.219
Hello? Mrs. Clark,
this is Olivia McCallum.

29:56.221 --> 29:58.321
Hi, Olivia. How's it going?

29:58.323 --> 30:00.357
We need to get out of here.

30:00.359 --> 30:02.492
<i>You gotta get over here, now.</i>

30:02.494 --> 30:03.960
What's going on?

30:03.962 --> 30:07.065
<i>I just found an article saying
that Aunt Beth murdered somebody.</i>

30:44.136 --> 30:46.203
You're not eating your food.

30:46.205 --> 30:49.341
I'm not really that hungry.
Sorry.

30:50.609 --> 30:53.043
Someone else,
on the other hand,

30:53.045 --> 30:56.279
is turning into a ravenous
little tiger.

30:56.281 --> 30:59.652
I'm glad to hear that.
I was worried about her.

31:02.454 --> 31:05.589
You know...
I was thinking,

31:05.591 --> 31:09.426
now that we've had a chance to get
to know each other a little better,

31:09.428 --> 31:13.263
it might be nice for you girls
to stay a little longer.

31:13.265 --> 31:15.367
We are family, after all.

31:16.602 --> 31:18.401
That's very nice of you,

31:18.403 --> 31:23.406
but I'm sure my father would
want to get us right away.

31:23.408 --> 31:27.611
From what I've heard, your father's
pretty hard to reach right now.

31:27.613 --> 31:30.080
Well, our friend reached him,
so it's okay.

31:30.082 --> 31:31.583
He should be here
in a few days.

31:32.284 --> 31:33.385
I see.

31:36.622 --> 31:39.523
Well, maybe we should ask
Claire what she thinks.

31:39.525 --> 31:42.325
Now that
she's feeling better.

31:42.327 --> 31:44.361
What do you think, Claire?

31:44.363 --> 31:48.735
Would you like to stay here,
in this house, for a while?

31:56.308 --> 31:58.643
So...

31:58.645 --> 32:02.080
you'd like to stay here,
instead of going with your father?

32:02.581 --> 32:03.683
Yes.

32:21.333 --> 32:22.367
Get out!

32:24.136 --> 32:26.169
Get it out.

32:26.171 --> 32:27.239
Get it out.

32:28.373 --> 32:30.140
Get it out.

32:30.142 --> 32:31.678
Get it out.

32:32.611 --> 32:34.712
What are you doing, Claire?

32:34.714 --> 32:36.683
I wanna get it out.

32:37.583 --> 32:39.217
Get it out.

32:41.253 --> 32:43.754
I want to get it out.

32:43.756 --> 32:45.690
I want to get it out.

32:45.692 --> 32:46.857
I want to get it out!

32:46.859 --> 32:48.661
- I want to get it out!
- Stop that!

33:02.240 --> 33:03.843
What's wrong with her?

33:04.744 --> 33:06.311
I don't know.

33:07.512 --> 33:09.581
- I'll go get Charles.
- No.

33:10.950 --> 33:12.719
To take her
to the hospital.

33:50.990 --> 33:52.657
How is she?

33:52.659 --> 33:54.557
She's sleeping now.

33:54.559 --> 33:57.329
Well, Charles brought his car.

33:58.765 --> 34:01.231
Okay, then, I'll go get her.

34:01.233 --> 34:02.867
There's no need to wake her.

34:02.869 --> 34:04.635
I'll carry her down.

34:04.637 --> 34:06.304
You go wait in the car.

34:48.346 --> 34:49.816
Where's Claire?

34:54.519 --> 34:57.054
She went into
the basement, didn't she?

34:57.056 --> 34:59.757
I could see it in her eyes.

34:59.759 --> 35:02.461
It's the same look Angela had.

35:04.030 --> 35:05.363
No!

35:05.765 --> 35:07.564
No!

35:07.566 --> 35:09.734
Get her phone.
Get her phone!

35:09.736 --> 35:11.468
No. Get off me!

35:11.470 --> 35:13.005
Hold her still.

35:15.507 --> 35:17.977
Come on! Take it.

35:18.945 --> 35:20.612
Oh, get your gun.

35:21.948 --> 35:22.949
Okay!

35:25.417 --> 35:26.618
Okay.

36:40.126 --> 36:41.828
No!

36:43.395 --> 36:45.062
Let me out!

36:45.064 --> 36:46.598
Please!

37:05.852 --> 37:07.483
Everything okay?

37:07.485 --> 37:09.722
Yeah. There's been
a change of plans...

37:13.626 --> 37:14.725
Oh, they're asleep right now,

37:14.727 --> 37:16.593
so it's probably
not the best time.

37:19.464 --> 37:20.998
I'm gonna
pick them up in the morning.

37:22.902 --> 37:24.502
- Okay. Yeah.
- Travel safe.

37:24.770 --> 37:26.038
No.

37:32.078 --> 37:34.078
I'm up here!

37:34.080 --> 37:36.814
Please, don't go!

37:36.816 --> 37:39.384
Don't go! Don't go!

37:39.752 --> 37:41.053
Don't...

37:46.959 --> 37:48.460
She's gone.

38:18.590 --> 38:19.659
Hey.

38:23.129 --> 38:24.163
Come on.

38:35.241 --> 38:36.574
Come on!

38:41.180 --> 38:42.882
Did you call the police?

38:51.691 --> 38:52.792
Gun.

38:54.026 --> 38:55.094
Okay.

39:23.155 --> 39:25.191
I found this under the...

39:31.931 --> 39:33.263
You should leave.

39:33.265 --> 39:35.666
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

39:35.668 --> 39:37.868
I know all about you.

39:37.870 --> 39:40.270
- I don't think you know what...
- Shut up!

39:40.272 --> 39:41.941
Go get the girls.

39:44.576 --> 39:45.610
Go!

39:48.080 --> 39:50.615
You try anything,
she dies.

39:58.958 --> 40:01.127
- Where's Claire?
- She's in there.

40:02.762 --> 40:03.896
Go get her.

40:06.165 --> 40:08.901
Don't look at her,
just go get Claire!

40:18.811 --> 40:20.246
You're a courageous woman.

40:21.113 --> 40:25.049
Foolish, but courageous.
I admire that.

40:25.051 --> 40:27.953
I don't give a shit
what you admire.

40:31.657 --> 40:34.358
Oh, my God.
What did they do to you?

40:34.360 --> 40:36.326
We didn't do anything to her.

40:36.328 --> 40:39.129
- Get down there!
- You can't take her away from here.

40:39.131 --> 40:40.731
It won't let you.

40:40.733 --> 40:42.001
Just go!

40:51.977 --> 40:54.011
No, I don't want to go!

40:54.013 --> 40:55.079
- Claire, come on.
- No, you have to.

40:55.081 --> 40:56.346
- Come on.
- No!

40:56.348 --> 40:58.248
- No. I don't want to.
- You'll feel better soon, Claire.

40:58.250 --> 41:00.417
No! No.

41:00.419 --> 41:02.286
Olivia, grab her feet.

41:02.288 --> 41:03.921
- I don't want to go. No!
- It's okay, honey.

41:03.923 --> 41:06.323
No! No! No!

41:06.325 --> 41:08.260
- Claire.
- I don't want to. No.

41:09.395 --> 41:10.595
No!

41:11.197 --> 41:12.898
I want to wait for Mommy.

41:13.899 --> 41:16.700
Mommy's dead, Claire.

41:16.702 --> 41:19.371
I know.
But she's coming back.

41:21.006 --> 41:22.308
Back where?

41:23.676 --> 41:25.077
Into the world.

41:30.049 --> 41:32.282
Let's get out of here.

41:32.284 --> 41:34.251
I want Lucy B.

41:34.253 --> 41:36.019
Claire, we have to go.

41:36.021 --> 41:38.088
Please?

41:38.090 --> 41:41.125
- I need Lucy B.
- Okay, it's fine. Just be quick.

41:41.127 --> 41:43.260
- All right?
- Okay.

41:43.262 --> 41:45.829
- Hurry.
- I'll be right back.

41:45.831 --> 41:48.465
Okay? She's gonna
go get Lucy B.

41:48.467 --> 41:50.202
Everything's going to be okay.

42:21.500 --> 42:22.835
<i>Don't leave.</i>

42:34.446 --> 42:36.148
<i>It's safe in here.</i>

43:14.019 --> 43:15.888
Where's your sister?

43:16.922 --> 43:18.224
She's gone.

43:19.425 --> 43:20.893
And your friend?

43:40.279 --> 43:42.512
<i>I was about
your same age...</i>

43:42.514 --> 43:45.351
<i>when I first learned the
truth about this house.</i>

43:47.453 --> 43:50.220
And I can assure you,

43:50.222 --> 43:53.492
I felt very much the same way
you do right now.

43:54.893 --> 43:56.395
What is happening?

43:58.430 --> 44:01.298
The first thing you need to know
is that your sister, Claire,

44:01.300 --> 44:03.200
is completely innocent.

44:03.202 --> 44:05.969
Everything she's doing
right now

44:05.971 --> 44:07.306
is because of it.

44:09.908 --> 44:11.310
"It"?

44:14.246 --> 44:19.383
This house is inhabited by an
entity of extreme malevolence.

44:19.385 --> 44:21.585
It's using your sister
to free itself

44:21.587 --> 44:24.521
and get back
into the world.

44:24.523 --> 44:28.558
Yes, it says there are
three doors.

44:28.560 --> 44:31.395
The mirror
is the first door.

44:31.397 --> 44:34.097
It leads to the mind.

44:34.099 --> 44:37.167
The mind is the second door.

44:37.169 --> 44:38.902
It leads to the body.

44:38.904 --> 44:42.105
The body is the third door.

44:42.107 --> 44:44.107
It leads to the world,

44:44.109 --> 44:45.978
and to destruction.

45:08.033 --> 45:11.970
That thing is using
your sister as a vessel.

45:14.306 --> 45:17.374
Taking shape inside her.

45:17.376 --> 45:20.012
Just like it did
inside Angela.

45:22.014 --> 45:23.882
So that's why you killed her?

45:26.418 --> 45:28.285
Yes.

45:28.287 --> 45:32.422
But only after I saw what she
had done to our parents.

45:32.424 --> 45:34.458
Then, it was self-defense?

45:34.460 --> 45:36.962
Of course it was.
What else would it be?

45:39.666 --> 45:42.301
You are not going
to kill my sister.

45:44.103 --> 45:46.038
Of course not.

45:47.573 --> 45:49.473
Why do you think
I came back here,

45:49.475 --> 45:51.341
to this house,

45:51.343 --> 45:52.945
after they released me?

45:54.714 --> 45:58.150
To find a way
to finally defeat it.

45:59.585 --> 46:01.654
To find a way
not to kill.

46:08.728 --> 46:11.261
Where do you think
she would be?

46:11.263 --> 46:15.132
She won't go far.
It won't let her.

46:15.134 --> 46:18.470
No. It needs
to keep her safe.

46:19.706 --> 46:21.907
She'll be somewhere
in this house.

46:30.249 --> 46:32.015
Can I ask you something?

46:32.017 --> 46:33.452
Of course.

46:38.390 --> 46:39.925
In the paper...

46:41.126 --> 46:44.161
it said that you were
a person of interest

46:44.163 --> 46:45.931
in Angela's killing.

46:50.035 --> 46:51.236
Yeah.

46:52.639 --> 46:54.039
That's what they said.

46:56.308 --> 46:57.710
Well?

46:58.645 --> 47:00.745
"Well," what?

47:00.747 --> 47:03.146
Were you there?

47:03.148 --> 47:05.551
Did you see Aunt Beth
kill Aunt Angela?

47:07.252 --> 47:08.954
Yeah.

47:10.022 --> 47:11.390
I was there.

47:14.627 --> 47:16.261
And, no...

47:17.329 --> 47:21.066
I didn't see your Aunt Beth
kill your Aunt Angela.

47:26.305 --> 47:28.006
We were both there.

47:30.042 --> 47:31.376
But it was...

47:32.110 --> 47:33.378
me.

47:34.346 --> 47:36.148
Me who...

47:37.349 --> 47:40.250
But you never went
to jail.

47:40.252 --> 47:43.656
I ran before the cops
got there.

47:44.757 --> 47:48.558
But...
Not your aunt.

47:48.560 --> 47:52.331
She thought if she could
just tell them the truth,

47:53.232 --> 47:54.466
they'd believe her.

47:56.101 --> 47:58.638
They interrogated her
for over 14 hours.

48:00.239 --> 48:03.141
She could have implicated me
at any time.

48:04.109 --> 48:06.278
Bargained for a better deal.

48:08.213 --> 48:09.381
She never did.

48:11.183 --> 48:14.152
She never even mentioned
my name.

48:17.122 --> 48:20.524
She spent the better part
of her young adult life

48:20.526 --> 48:23.293
in a... mental hospital.

48:23.295 --> 48:24.795
While...

48:24.797 --> 48:27.798
I graduated high school,
went to college,

48:27.800 --> 48:31.169
got married,
got divorced...

48:35.140 --> 48:36.643
I owe her my life.

48:46.151 --> 48:47.386
There you are.

48:49.621 --> 48:50.690
So...

48:51.490 --> 48:53.626
Do you think
you're up for this?

51:37.422 --> 51:39.257
Charles! Beth!

52:24.336 --> 52:25.403
No!

53:28.167 --> 53:29.367
Claire?

53:39.111 --> 53:40.478
Who are you?

53:48.855 --> 53:50.923
No. Claire?

53:52.158 --> 53:53.458
Claire.

53:57.596 --> 53:59.697
Claire, stop!

53:59.699 --> 54:00.933
Stop, please!

54:02.635 --> 54:03.669
Please.

54:18.885 --> 54:21.151
How long till we get
this thing out of her?

54:21.153 --> 54:23.153
Not long.

54:26.025 --> 54:30.761
Uh, yeah. We just need something
that belongs to your sister.

54:30.763 --> 54:31.797
Her bunny.

54:32.632 --> 54:34.464
Perfect.

54:34.466 --> 54:35.968
The two of you go get it.

54:36.369 --> 54:38.037
Yeah, okay.

54:45.044 --> 54:46.578
It should be in here.

54:49.215 --> 54:51.050
No!

54:54.586 --> 54:56.621
No, no, no!

55:06.498 --> 55:09.567
No! Let me out!

55:13.773 --> 55:15.607
Please!

55:22.949 --> 55:24.083
No.

55:27.954 --> 55:29.088
I'm sorry.

56:04.957 --> 56:06.192
Get away from her.

56:09.228 --> 56:10.928
Olivia.

56:10.930 --> 56:12.730
What did you do to her?

56:12.732 --> 56:15.866
We just gave her a sedative
to relax her.

56:15.868 --> 56:17.835
Put down the knife.

56:17.837 --> 56:19.872
- Olivia.
- Put it down!

56:27.246 --> 56:29.682
You said you were
going to help her.

56:31.817 --> 56:34.818
I wish I could help her.

56:34.820 --> 56:39.757
For more than 15 years,
I have tried to find a way to help her,

56:39.759 --> 56:41.559
and others like her.

56:42.795 --> 56:44.596
But I failed.

56:45.097 --> 56:46.632
You lied to me.

56:47.633 --> 56:49.333
I had no choice.

56:49.335 --> 56:52.336
If this thing gets out,

56:52.338 --> 56:54.306
many more people will die.

56:57.009 --> 56:59.278
It says in the book...

57:00.046 --> 57:02.913
"Only through death

57:02.915 --> 57:05.983
"will the third door
be closed."

57:05.985 --> 57:08.087
We have to do this!

57:14.293 --> 57:15.294
Give me the knife.

57:39.685 --> 57:40.884
Take her out of here.

57:40.886 --> 57:43.320
No.

57:43.322 --> 57:46.156
Are you really gonna
let her do this?

57:46.158 --> 57:47.991
Are you really gonna
let her kill Claire

57:47.993 --> 57:50.661
because of something
she read in a book?

57:50.663 --> 57:52.031
Don't listen to her.

57:52.998 --> 57:55.099
Think!

57:55.101 --> 57:57.334
Do you really want the death
of another little girl

57:57.336 --> 57:59.136
in your conscience?

57:59.138 --> 58:01.140
You know this has to be done!

58:12.184 --> 58:14.186
There has to be another way.

58:15.221 --> 58:17.788
There is no other way.

58:17.790 --> 58:19.358
And you know that!

58:20.960 --> 58:21.961
No.

58:22.228 --> 58:24.728
I don't.

58:24.730 --> 58:26.966
All I know
is what you've told me.

58:28.734 --> 58:30.636
Don't be a fool!

58:31.370 --> 58:32.972
I'm sorry.

58:41.180 --> 58:43.215
You were always weak.

58:52.491 --> 58:55.327
You don't know
what you're doing!

59:01.467 --> 59:03.300
She's not evil,
you know?

59:03.302 --> 59:06.737
She... She loved Angela,
and she loves your sister, too.

59:06.739 --> 59:09.408
She just...
believes what she's saying.

59:10.776 --> 59:11.877
And what about you?

59:13.312 --> 59:14.978
What do you believe?

59:14.980 --> 59:16.513
I... I don't know.

59:16.515 --> 59:19.917
All I know is that when Angela
died, that thing was gone.

59:19.919 --> 59:23.889
Well, not gone, it's...
It's back in its cage, anyway.

59:26.192 --> 59:28.392
You're probably hungry,
I'll make you some food.

59:28.394 --> 59:29.795
No peanut butter.

59:31.530 --> 59:32.831
Wait.

59:38.871 --> 59:40.406
Are you sure about this?

59:44.176 --> 59:47.246
No. But what other choice
do we have?

1:00:32.258 --> 1:00:33.792
Not yet!

1:00:57.549 --> 1:00:58.884
Not yet!

1:01:19.972 --> 1:01:20.973
Now!

1:01:23.042 --> 1:01:24.276
Come on.

1:01:26.979 --> 1:01:29.415
- Fuck!
- Come on, Claire.

1:01:32.518 --> 1:01:34.953
Come on. Come on, come on.

1:01:37.022 --> 1:01:39.191
Come on, Claire.

1:01:49.101 --> 1:01:50.235
Can she take that many?

1:01:57.609 --> 1:01:58.844
Claire.

1:02:03.315 --> 1:02:06.684
Claire?
Come on, Claire. Please.

1:02:06.686 --> 1:02:09.254
Come on. Claire, come on.
Wake up.

1:02:09.922 --> 1:02:11.288
Claire, wake up.

1:02:11.290 --> 1:02:13.056
- Wake up.
- Claire!

1:02:13.058 --> 1:02:16.026
Wake up! Wake up. Please.

1:02:16.028 --> 1:02:19.563
Please, wake up.

1:02:19.565 --> 1:02:22.601
Please, Claire...

1:02:37.483 --> 1:02:38.951
I'm so sorry.

1:02:40.386 --> 1:02:41.520
I'm sorry.

1:02:47.092 --> 1:02:48.093
Livvy?

1:02:55.702 --> 1:02:57.469
Claire... Claire...

1:03:01.473 --> 1:03:03.306
My stomach hurts.

1:03:30.569 --> 1:03:32.102
Hey.

1:03:32.104 --> 1:03:33.605
How's she holding up?

1:03:34.774 --> 1:03:36.306
Like you'd expect.

1:03:36.308 --> 1:03:38.608
Stubbornly insisting
that she's right,

1:03:38.610 --> 1:03:41.111
that we couldn't possibly
have sent that thing back

1:03:41.113 --> 1:03:42.546
using peanut butter.

1:03:42.548 --> 1:03:45.048
Then, how does she
explain Claire?

1:03:45.050 --> 1:03:47.186
I don't think she can,
to be honest.

1:03:53.225 --> 1:03:56.326
It's enough to get you by
until your dad gets back.

1:03:56.328 --> 1:03:58.430
Beth asked me
to give it to you.

1:03:59.164 --> 1:04:00.165
It's all right.

1:04:01.099 --> 1:04:02.299
Take it.

1:04:02.301 --> 1:04:05.137
I think it's the easiest way
for her to say she's sorry.

1:04:08.741 --> 1:04:09.975
Where will you go?

1:04:10.810 --> 1:04:12.677
Back to our old house for now.

1:04:12.679 --> 1:04:15.078
Girls your age
shouldn't be on their own.

1:04:15.080 --> 1:04:17.782
I think we'll survive.

1:04:17.784 --> 1:04:19.817
Well, let me give you
a lift, anyway.

1:04:19.819 --> 1:04:21.520
It's the least I can do.

1:04:27.593 --> 1:04:29.426
You couldn't find her?

1:04:29.428 --> 1:04:31.127
No.

1:04:31.129 --> 1:04:32.763
But it's okay.

1:04:32.765 --> 1:04:34.333
I don't need her anymore.

1:04:36.134 --> 1:04:38.437
Great. Let's go, then.

1:04:59.424 --> 1:05:01.159
Back door.

1:05:16.643 --> 1:05:18.375
Claire!

1:05:20.780 --> 1:05:21.814
Come on!

1:05:24.416 --> 1:05:25.652
What happened?

1:05:36.829 --> 1:05:37.830
Claire.

1:05:45.304 --> 1:05:46.405
Olivia.

1:05:47.239 --> 1:05:48.440
Olivia!

1:05:59.919 --> 1:06:01.484
Olivia, come on!

1:06:03.522 --> 1:06:05.288
This way.

1:06:05.290 --> 1:06:06.456
This way, come on.

1:06:28.280 --> 1:06:29.381
It stopped.

1:06:34.486 --> 1:06:35.621
What's happening?

1:06:40.793 --> 1:06:45.462
Wait.
I, uh... Wait, wait.

1:06:45.464 --> 1:06:47.199
I read something here.

1:06:48.233 --> 1:06:50.600
Wait, it's... here.

1:06:50.602 --> 1:06:54.872
"It is possible, if their door
be not fully closed,

1:06:54.874 --> 1:06:57.675
"in traveling from the realms
of elemental darkness,

1:06:57.677 --> 1:07:01.546
"a spirit may become
caught between two worlds...

1:07:02.280 --> 1:07:04.882
"tethered to their place
of origin

1:07:04.884 --> 1:07:07.317
"until such time
as they're able

1:07:07.319 --> 1:07:08.721
"to complete their journey."

1:07:10.990 --> 1:07:13.456
That must be it.

1:07:13.458 --> 1:07:16.259
That's why it still
wants Claire.

1:07:16.261 --> 1:07:18.595
And that's why it's able
to touch us,

1:07:18.597 --> 1:07:20.965
to affect us physically...

1:07:20.967 --> 1:07:23.936
even though
we still can't see it.

1:07:31.243 --> 1:07:32.511
I did see it.

1:07:36.615 --> 1:07:38.685
And I think I heard it.

1:07:44.657 --> 1:07:45.792
That means...

1:07:46.993 --> 1:07:48.928
maybe we can kill it.

1:07:50.362 --> 1:07:52.529
But we need something first.

1:07:52.531 --> 1:07:53.900
What?

1:08:30.636 --> 1:08:32.602
What happened?

1:08:32.604 --> 1:08:35.405
Olivia!

1:08:35.407 --> 1:08:36.807
There are flashlights
in the cupboard.

1:08:36.809 --> 1:08:38.410
There's more
in the kitchen.

1:08:40.079 --> 1:08:41.712
I can't find it.

1:08:46.819 --> 1:08:48.921
Beth, wasn't there
a lantern in here?

1:08:51.958 --> 1:08:53.325
Claire...

1:08:57.496 --> 1:08:58.865
What?

1:09:06.105 --> 1:09:07.905
Charles!

1:09:07.907 --> 1:09:09.572
What happened?
What happened?

1:09:09.574 --> 1:09:11.508
She's gone. It took her.

1:09:11.510 --> 1:09:12.943
Claire! Claire!

1:09:12.945 --> 1:09:14.577
Claire!

1:09:14.579 --> 1:09:17.648
- Claire! Claire!
- Claire!

1:09:17.650 --> 1:09:19.850
I don't see her.
She's not here.

1:09:19.852 --> 1:09:22.387
Claire.

1:09:25.524 --> 1:09:27.057
The basement!

1:09:27.059 --> 1:09:28.795
The basement!

1:09:34.867 --> 1:09:38.535
- Oh, come on.
- Claire!

1:09:40.472 --> 1:09:42.041
- The elevator!
- No!

1:09:43.475 --> 1:09:44.710
What?

1:09:49.715 --> 1:09:51.447
- Charles!
- It won't open!

1:10:03.562 --> 1:10:06.065
<i>Say the words, Claire.</i>

1:10:08.034 --> 1:10:09.702
<i>Be a good girl.</i>

1:10:15.741 --> 1:10:18.010
<i>You wouldn't want to
make Mommy...</i>

1:10:19.078 --> 1:10:20.079
<i>angry!</i>

1:10:27.419 --> 1:10:28.855
She's upstairs!

1:10:36.528 --> 1:10:38.865
Claire!

1:11:27.046 --> 1:11:29.046
Run, Claire!

1:11:58.678 --> 1:12:00.478
No!

1:12:42.955 --> 1:12:44.088
Olivia?

1:12:44.090 --> 1:12:46.726
Claire? Claire!

1:13:02.241 --> 1:13:03.575
Olivia?

1:13:04.944 --> 1:13:05.945
Olivia!

1:14:19.685 --> 1:14:20.853
Olivia!

1:14:37.002 --> 1:14:39.338
Olivia!

1:14:41.073 --> 1:14:42.808
Olivia!

1:14:43.709 --> 1:14:46.011
No!

1:14:56.322 --> 1:14:59.123
Mirror, mirror, open wide,

1:14:59.125 --> 1:15:01.694
let the spirit come inside.

1:15:10.269 --> 1:15:14.073
Mirror, mirror, open wide...

1:15:16.809 --> 1:15:18.909
Let the spirit
come inside...

1:15:26.886 --> 1:15:29.086
- Don't let her say the words.
- Mirror, mirror,

1:15:29.088 --> 1:15:32.990
open wide.
Let the spirit come inside.

1:15:32.992 --> 1:15:35.794
Claire, don't say the words!

1:15:52.344 --> 1:15:57.283
Mirror, mirror,
open wide,

1:15:58.217 --> 1:16:02.186
let this spirit come inside.

1:16:02.188 --> 1:16:03.987
Aunt Beth, no.

1:16:03.989 --> 1:16:10.060
Mirror, mirror, open wide...

1:16:10.062 --> 1:16:15.267
Let this spirit come inside.

1:16:18.537 --> 1:16:24.908
Mirror, mirror, open wide,

1:16:24.910 --> 1:16:29.079
let this spirit come inside!

1:16:29.081 --> 1:16:30.783
Please, no.

1:16:31.483 --> 1:16:33.817
Aunt Beth, I can't do this.

1:16:33.819 --> 1:16:34.820
Do it.

1:16:38.023 --> 1:16:39.189
I can't.

1:16:42.161 --> 1:16:44.528
No. Please, stop.

1:16:44.530 --> 1:16:45.796
No.

1:17:58.904 --> 1:18:00.005
Claire...

1:18:04.310 --> 1:18:06.945
It's over. It's over.

1:18:09.081 --> 1:18:12.818
<i>♪ Sing with me</i>

1:18:14.620 --> 1:18:20.590
