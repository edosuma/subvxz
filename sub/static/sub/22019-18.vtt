WEBVTT

00:03.480 --> 00:06.995
MAN: MURIEL? I'M BACK.

00:09.480 --> 00:12.916
MURIEL? IT'S ME.

00:19.190 --> 00:22.569
LOOK, I'M SORRY.

00:22.630 --> 00:26.452
CAN'T WE AT LEAST
TALK ABOUT IT?

00:26.500 --> 00:27.888
MURIEL!

00:35.070 --> 00:38.369
AAH! SON OF A--

00:51.700 --> 00:54.658
PRENTISS:
I GAVE AT THE OFFICE.

00:54.700 --> 00:56.873
OH, GOOD,
YOU'RE STILL HERE.

00:56.920 --> 00:58.262
YEAH, IT'S THE BAU, DAVE.

00:58.310 --> 01:01.188
I'VE GOT A PUP TENT AND
K-RATIONS IN THE CLOSET.

01:01.230 --> 01:02.356
WHAT'S UP?

01:02.410 --> 01:03.445
EGGROLL?

01:03.490 --> 01:04.889
UH, I'M GOOD, THANKS.

01:04.930 --> 01:07.148
EMILY, DO YOU THINK I CAN
GET THE NEXT FEW DAYS OFF,

01:07.190 --> 01:09.329
USE SOME
OF MY ANNUAL LEAVE?

01:11.540 --> 01:12.757
WHAT?

01:12.810 --> 01:14.198
DAVID ROSSI, TIME OFF?

01:14.240 --> 01:16.549
I THINK WE'VE ENTERED
A PARALLEL UNIVERSE.

01:16.590 --> 01:17.545
HMM.

01:18.810 --> 01:20.072
OUCH. NOPE.
THIS IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING.

01:20.120 --> 01:21.894
OK, YOU CAN STOP
THE THEATRICS.

01:21.950 --> 01:25.169
I GOT A CALL THIS EVENING
FROM KRYSTALL.

01:25.210 --> 01:28.384
KRYSTALL WITH
THE "K" AND TWO Ls?

01:28.430 --> 01:29.909
WHOA, WAIT.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

01:29.950 --> 01:31.121
DID I MISS SOMETHING?

01:31.170 --> 01:32.956
UH, SHE WAS ROSSI'S
THIRD EX-WIFE.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.219
SHE WAS A BLACKJACK
DEALER IN LAS VEGAS.

01:36.270 --> 01:37.396
AND OUR LOVE BLOSSOMED

01:37.440 --> 01:40.091
AS SO MANY OF
THE GREAT ONES DO,

01:40.140 --> 01:43.314
OVER A DECK OF CARDS
AND LOTS OF CASINO
COMPED BOOZE.

01:43.360 --> 01:45.965
NOW, WHAT HAPPENED?
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A LOVE FOR THE AGES.

01:46.010 --> 01:48.353
ONCE WE SOBERED UP, WE HAD
THE MARRIAGE ANNULLED.

01:48.410 --> 01:50.753
WHY DID I NOT KNOW
ABOUT THIS?

01:50.800 --> 01:53.052
YOU KNOW THE RULES.
ALL GOSSIP FUNNELS
THROUGH ME.

01:53.110 --> 01:54.407
OH, WAIT, IT GETS BE'ITER.

01:54.460 --> 01:55.620
THEY GOT MARRIED
IN ONE OF THOSE

01:55.680 --> 01:57.068
DRIVE-TH ROUGH
WEDDING CHAPELS, RIGHT?

01:57.110 --> 01:59.192
YEAH. TWO BLOCKS
OFF THE STRIP.

01:59.240 --> 02:02.459
OUR SACRED VOWS
WERE OFFICIATED BY
AN ELVIS IMPERSONATOR,

02:02.510 --> 02:04.501
WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN
DRUNKER THAN WE WERE.

02:04.550 --> 02:06.598
HAVE YOU SEEN
THIS WOMAN SINCE?

02:06.640 --> 02:09.905
BIRTHDAY
AND CHRISTMAS CARDS,
BUT FACE TO FACE, NO.

02:09.950 --> 02:12.999
SHE MOVED TO L.A.,
GOT REMARRIED,
HAD A KID, GOT DIVORCED.

02:13.040 --> 02:14.826
NOW HER DAUGHTER'S
GONNA GET MARRIED

02:14.870 --> 02:16.644
HERE IN D.C.
NEXT WEEK.

02:17.960 --> 02:19.257
WE HOPE TO GET TOGETHER
FOR COFFEE,

02:19.310 --> 02:21.562
BUT IF THAT'S
A NEW CASE COMING IN...

02:21.610 --> 02:24.261
YEAH, THERE IS, AND WE CAN
HANDLE IT WITHOUT YOU.

02:24.310 --> 02:26.130
YOU KEEP THAT COFFEE DATE.
THAT'S AN ORDER.

02:26.180 --> 02:28.262
JUST PROMISE ME ONE THING.

02:28.320 --> 02:31.357
NO SPUR-OF-THE-MOMENT TRIPS
TO ATLANTIC CITY.

02:33.500 --> 02:35.445
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GATHER THE TROOPS.

02:35.500 --> 02:37.968
YEAH.

02:38.020 --> 02:40.750
MARRIED BY AN ELVIS
IMPERSONATOR.

02:40.810 --> 02:43.768
I NEED TO STEP UP MY GAME.

02:43.810 --> 02:46.984
MURIEL GOURSE, 47,
OF CHICAGO, ILLINOIS,

02:47.030 --> 02:50.249
WAS FOUND DEAD LAST NIGHT,
STABBED ONCE IN THE BACK.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.814
THE NIGHT BEFORE,
24-YEAR-OLD AMANDA CORLISS

02:52.860 --> 02:54.293
WAS DISCOVERED
IN HER APARTMENT.

02:54.340 --> 02:55.739
SHE HAD ALSO
BEEN STABBED IN THE BACK.

02:55.780 --> 02:57.031
SAME RED ROSE IN THE MOUTH.

02:57.080 --> 02:58.775
GARCIA: NO SIGN OF ROBBERY
OR BREAK-INS.

02:58.830 --> 03:00.388
DESPITE THEIR BEING
A LOT OF NEIGHBORS,

03:00.440 --> 03:01.600
NOBODY HEARD A PEEP.

03:01.650 --> 03:02.696
YOU KNOW, ROSES
ARE TRADITIONALLY

03:02.740 --> 03:04.298
A SYMBOL OF PASSION AND LOVE.

03:04.350 --> 03:06.659
THE UNSUB COULD BE CONNECTED
TO THESE VICTIMS ROMANTICALLY.

03:06.700 --> 03:08.224
OR MAYBE HE WANTED TO BE

03:08.270 --> 03:09.999
AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED
WHEN THINGS DIDN'T WORK OUT.

03:10.050 --> 03:12.484
LEWIS: NEITHER VICTIM SHOWED
EVIDENCE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT,

03:12.540 --> 03:16.226
AND THERE IS A DRAMATIC
DIFFERENCE IN AGE
BETWEEN THE TWO VICTIMS.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.976
MURIEL GOURSE'S BODY
WAS DISCOVERED
BY HER HUSBAND.

03:19.020 --> 03:20.885
THERE WAS ALSO
A CARTON OF CIGARETTES

03:20.930 --> 03:22.329
BURNING IN THEIR OVEN.

03:22.370 --> 03:23.587
THAT'S AN UNUSUAL
SIGNATURE.

03:23.630 --> 03:24.801
ANYTHING LIKE THAT
WITH AMANDA?

03:24.850 --> 03:26.067
GARCIA: NO.

03:26.110 --> 03:27.190
SIMMONS: IT FEELS LIKE
A MESSAGE, BUT WHAT?

03:27.250 --> 03:28.501
AND TO WHOM?

03:28.550 --> 03:30.199
JAREAU: SO WE'VE GOT
NO FORCIBLE ENTRY,

03:30.250 --> 03:33.151
MINIMAL RESISTANCE,
AND NO CRIES FOR HELP.

03:33.210 --> 03:34.245
I'D SAY THERE'S
A GOOD CHANCE

03:34.300 --> 03:35.642
THESE WOMEN
KNEW THE KILLER.

03:35.690 --> 03:37.510
AND WITH TWO VICTIMS
ON CONSECUTIVE NIGHTS,

03:37.560 --> 03:39.687
WE CAN'T WAIT TILL MORNING.
WHEELS UP IN 30.

03:39.740 --> 03:43.346
WOMEN:
I NEVER SEEM TO PLEASE YOU

03:43.390 --> 03:47.212
NO MATTER HOW MUCH I TRY

03:47.270 --> 03:50.353
WHY PRETEND YOU LOVE ME

03:50.400 --> 03:53.699
WHEN IT'S JUST AN ALIBI?

03:53.750 --> 03:57.311
YOU BETTER CHOOSE
YOUR WAY OF LOVIN'

03:57.360 --> 04:01.569
BEFORE THE WELL RUNS DRY

04:26.700 --> 04:30.045
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
ABC STUDIOS, LLC AND CBS, INC.

04:36.750 --> 04:37.967
LEWIS: "PERHAPS WHEN
WE FIND OURSELVES

04:38.010 --> 04:39.352
"WANTING EVERYTHING,
IT IS BECAUSE

04:39.400 --> 04:41.448
WE ARE DANGEROUSLY NEAR
TO WANTING NOTHING."

04:41.490 --> 04:44.664
SYLVIA PLATH.

04:44.710 --> 04:46.496
SIMMONS: THE FIRST VICTIM
AMANDA CORLISS

04:46.540 --> 04:49.407
LED A FAIRLY HIGH-RISK
LIFESTYLE--PARTY GIRL,

04:49.460 --> 04:51.621
LOTS OF RECREATIONAL
DRUG USE AND CASUAL SEX.

04:51.680 --> 04:53.762
DID SHE HAVE A JOB,
GARCIA?

04:53.810 --> 04:55.198
UH, DO YOU CONSIDER

04:55.250 --> 04:57.468
STROLLING
TO THE LOCAL ATM A JOB?

04:57.510 --> 04:58.727
IF YOU DO, SHE HAD A JOB.

04:58.770 --> 05:00.465
IF NOT, SHE WAS
A TRUST FUND KID.

05:00.510 --> 05:03.206
REID: HEY, GARCIA, WAS SHE
ROMANTICALLY INVOLVED
WITH ANYONE SPECIAL?

05:03.250 --> 05:05.946
UH, SHE SORT OF BOUNCED
AROUND FROM DUDE TO DUDE.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.251
PRENTISS: ON THE OTHER END
OF THE SPECTRUM.

05:07.300 --> 05:09.348
MURIEL GOURSE WAS
A MIDDLE SCHOOL TEACHER,

05:09.390 --> 05:10.903
LIVED QUIETLY
IN THE SUBURBS

05:10.960 --> 05:12.564
WITH HER HUSBAND
OF 23 YEARS.

05:12.610 --> 05:14.692
IT DOESN'T GET MORE
LOW RISK THAN THAT.

05:14.740 --> 05:16.264
REID: IT SAYS HERE THAT
AMANDA'S DRUG USE

05:16.310 --> 05:18.358
WAS PRIMARILY MDMA.

05:18.400 --> 05:19.958
BUT THERE'S ALSO SOME
ANTIDEPRESSANTS IN THE MIX.

05:20.010 --> 05:22.092
SHE HAD UNDERLYING
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.

05:22.140 --> 05:24.279
MURIEL'S LIFE WASN'T
ALL THAT IDYLLIC EITHER.

05:24.320 --> 05:25.480
HER AND HER HUSBAND
WERE SEEING A COUNSELOR.

05:25.540 --> 05:27.144
THEIR MARRIAGE
WAS IN TROUBLE.

05:27.190 --> 05:28.919
LEWIS: WELL, MAYBE THAT'S
THE COMMON THREAD,

05:28.980 --> 05:30.584
DISSATISFACT ION
WITH THEIR LOVE LIVES.

05:30.630 --> 05:32.678
REID: ONE STAB WOUND
TO THE BACK AND NO SIGN
OF A STRUGGLE.

05:32.720 --> 05:34.711
THE UNSUB PROBABLY BRINGS
A GUN TO HELP CONTROL THEM.

05:34.760 --> 05:36.455
BRINGS A GUN
BUT DOESN'T USE IT.

05:36.510 --> 05:38.580
THIS KILLER PREFERS
A MORE PERSONAL TOUCH.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.289
WE LAND IN
A COUPLE OF HOURS.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.854
LET'S BE READY TO HIT
THE GROUND RUNNING.

05:42.900 --> 05:46.597
ROSSI: HA HA HA!
ARE YOU

05:46.650 --> 05:50.120
I COULD HAVE SWORN
IT WAS "HERE COMES THE BRIDE."

05:50.170 --> 05:52.479
THAT IS YOUR BRAIN
DOING DAMAGE CONTROL.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.772
I AM TELLING YOU, WE
MARCHED DOWN THE AISLE

05:54.830 --> 05:55.910
TO "HOUND DOG."

05:55.960 --> 05:56.995
REALLY?

05:57.050 --> 05:58.301
TRUST ME, DAVID,
I REMEMBER.

05:58.350 --> 05:59.999
THE CASSETTE DECK
WAS SITTING RIGHT THERE

06:00.050 --> 06:03.440
ON THE ALTAR BETWEEN
THE BIBLE AND THE TEQUILA.

06:03.490 --> 06:06.789
WELL, WHATEVER OUR SONG WAS,
IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

06:06.840 --> 06:09.229
I LIKE THE SILVER
IN YOUR HAIR.

06:09.280 --> 06:10.963
DID I GIVE YOU THAT OR--

06:11.020 --> 06:12.920
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
MY PUBLISHERS

06:12.980 --> 06:14.015
HAVE BEEN BUGGING ME
ABOUT LOOKING

06:14.060 --> 06:15.618
MORE DISTINGUISHED,
SO I DECIDED

06:15.670 --> 06:16.932
TO GO AU NATURAL.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.360
SO PORTIA'S GETTING MARRIED.

06:19.420 --> 06:20.899
YOU MUST BE VERY EXCITED.

06:20.940 --> 06:23.022
YEAH, THAT'S ANOTHER WAY
OF SAYING NERVOUS WRECK.

06:23.070 --> 06:24.503
AND WHO'S
THE LUCKY GROOM?

06:24.550 --> 06:26.154
WICK ROLLINS

06:26.210 --> 06:28.553
FROM SAVANNAH, GEORGIA.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.727
HE DOESN'T REALLY
TALK LIKE THAT.

06:30.780 --> 06:32.259
SWEETHEART OF A GUY.

06:32.300 --> 06:35.030
AND SHE'S--PORTIA'S
OVER THE MOON.

06:35.090 --> 06:37.604
I'M THRILLED FOR HER,
FOR BOTH OF YOU.

06:37.650 --> 06:39.914
HEY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
I MEAN, OUT OF THE BLUE

06:39.960 --> 06:42.827
YOU'RE--YOU HAVE
A DAUGHTER AND A GRANDSON?

06:42.880 --> 06:45.269
YEP. JOY AND KAI.

06:45.310 --> 06:47.005
IT WAS A WONDERFUL
SURPRISE.

06:47.050 --> 06:48.608
AND YOUR EX?

06:48.660 --> 06:50.662
WELL, WE BOTH REALIZED

06:50.710 --> 06:52.143
WE'RE BETTER AS GRANDPARENTS

06:52.190 --> 06:53.578
THAN WE ARE AS A COUPLE.

06:53.630 --> 06:56.360
BUT IT'S TURNED INTO
A VERY NICE FRIENDSHIP.

06:56.410 --> 06:58.401
RIGHT.
ENOUGH CATCHING UP.

06:58.460 --> 07:00.883
I HAVE A PROPOSITION
FOR YOU.

07:00.940 --> 07:04.376
YOU KNOW, LAST TIME
WE DID SOMETHING LIKE THAT--

07:04.420 --> 07:08.800
RELAX. ELVIS HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

07:08.860 --> 07:10.282
WHAT'S THIS?

07:10.340 --> 07:11.637
AN INVITATION.

07:11.690 --> 07:13.203
I WANT YOU TO COME
TO THE WEDDING

07:13.250 --> 07:14.649
AS MY PLUS ONE.

07:14.690 --> 07:16.646
PORTIA'S OK WITH THAT?

07:16.690 --> 07:20.387
THIS IS A GIRL WHO HAS
READ ALL OF YOUR
BOOKS TWICE.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.249
TO HER, THE MOST
IMPRESSIVE THING
ABOUT ME

07:22.310 --> 07:25.529
IS THAT YOU AND I WERE
MARRIED FOR 36 HOURS.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.083
SHE'LL BE OK.

07:27.140 --> 07:28.220
WELL, IF THAT'S THE CASE,

07:28.270 --> 07:29.749
I'M HONORED TO ATTEND.

07:29.790 --> 07:31.838
GREAT. NOW I GOTTA RUN.

07:31.880 --> 07:34.929
HEY, LISTEN. UM,
IF YOU'VE GOT TIME LATER,

07:34.970 --> 07:37.962
WHY DON'T YOU BRING
PORTIA AND WICK TO THE BAU?

07:38.020 --> 07:40.181
I'LL GIVE THE 3 OF YOU
A TOUR.

07:40.240 --> 07:41.923
CONSIDER IT A DATE.

07:51.860 --> 07:53.942
ISN'T THERE A DANCE WHERE
THE COUPLE HOLDS ROSES

07:53.990 --> 07:55.423
BETWEEN THEIR TEETH?

07:55.470 --> 07:56.903
IT'S THE TANGO, RIGHT?

07:56.950 --> 07:58.463
THAT'S ACTUALLY A COMMON
MISCONCEPTION.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.420
RUDOLPH VALENTINO DID IT
WHILE DANCING THE TANGO

08:00.480 --> 08:03.085
IN THE 1921 FILM
"FOUR HORSEMEN
OF THE APOCALYPSE,"

08:03.130 --> 08:05.473
BUT THE AUTHENTIC
ARGENTINIAN DANCE
DOESN'T INVOLVE A ROSE

08:05.520 --> 08:07.078
OR ANY OTHER FLOWER,
FOR THAT MATTER.

08:07.130 --> 08:08.779
PRENTISS: LEAVE SOME SPACE
ON THAT BOARD.

08:08.830 --> 08:11.003
A THIRD VICTIM
WAS JUST DISCOVERED.

08:11.050 --> 08:13.098
STABBED IN THE BACK,
RED ROSE IN HER MOUTH,

08:13.140 --> 08:14.220
JUST LIKE THE OTHERS.

08:14.270 --> 08:15.658
SO MUCH FOR
A COOLING-OFF PERIOD.

08:15.710 --> 08:17.746
SPENCE, YOU AND JJ GO
TO THE NEW CRIME SCENE.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.609
LUKE AND TARA ARE
WITH THE ME. NOW.

08:19.670 --> 08:23.049
MATT, MURIEL GOURSE'S
HUSBAND IS ON HIS WAY IN.

08:23.110 --> 08:25.533
TALK TO HIM, SEE IF HE KNOWS
SOMETHING WE DON'T.

08:27.500 --> 08:30.196
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE
THE BAU IN TOWN AGAIN.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.504
I WAS LOOKIN' TO SAY HELLO
TO AGENT MORGAN.

08:32.550 --> 08:33.983
HE RETIRED.

08:34.030 --> 08:35.509
REALLY?

08:35.550 --> 08:37.336
YEAH. HE'S MARRIED.
HE'S GOT A LITTLE BOY NOW.

08:37.380 --> 08:39.598
TOOK THE PLUNGE.

08:39.640 --> 08:41.596
WELL, DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

08:41.650 --> 08:45.996
I'LL FIND A WAY
TO CARRY ON, SOMEHOW.

08:46.040 --> 08:48.952
C.O.D. FOR BOTH VICTIMS
WAS A SINGLE STAB WOUND

08:49.000 --> 08:50.479
TO THE BACK.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.782
UNUSUAL LACERATIONS, THOUGH.

08:52.830 --> 08:53.956
HOW SO?

08:54.010 --> 08:55.489
WELL, BLADE WAS
THICKER AND SHORTER

08:55.530 --> 08:56.781
THAN A STANDARD KNIFE.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.569
MORE LIKE A DAGGER.

08:58.620 --> 09:00.315
ARE THOSE LIGATURE MARKS?

09:00.360 --> 09:02.578
YES, MA'AM.
INITIALLY I THOUGHT

09:02.620 --> 09:04.622
THAT THE PERPETRATOR
TRIED TO STRANGLE HER

09:04.670 --> 09:06.183
WITH THE NECKLACE
SHE WAS WEARING,

09:06.240 --> 09:09.494
BUT THE LIGATURE MARKS
WERE INFLICT ED POSTMORTEM.

09:09.540 --> 09:11.417
SO THE UNSUB HANDLED
THE NECKLACE.

09:11.460 --> 09:13.803
DID YOU RETRIEVE ANY DNA
FROM THE JEWELRY?

09:13.850 --> 09:15.499
UNFORTUNATELY NOT.

09:15.550 --> 09:17.154
THE KILLER MUST HAVE
WORE GLOVES.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.589
BUT I DID FIND
SOMETHING CURIOUS

09:19.640 --> 09:22.814
ON MURIEL GOURSE'S
BODY, THOUGH.

09:22.860 --> 09:25.420
SLIGHT SINGEING
OF THE EYELASHES

09:25.470 --> 09:26.687
AND THE EYEBROWS.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.640
AND THERE WERE TRACES
OF SMOKE IN HER LUNGS.

09:28.690 --> 09:30.829
HER HEAD MUST HAVE BEEN
FORCED INTO THE OVEN.

09:30.870 --> 09:34.476
MM. WHILE SHE WAS
STILL ALIVE.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.786
DRINK RESIDUE ALL OVER
THE VICTIM'S FACE.

09:38.830 --> 09:40.388
UNLIKELY SHE WAS
CONSUMING ANY OF IT,

09:40.440 --> 09:43.352
THOUGH THAT SPLATTER
PATTERN SUGGESTS
IT WAS POURED ON HER,

09:43.400 --> 09:44.833
POSSIBLY POSTMORTEM.

09:44.880 --> 09:47.667
YEAH. I DON'T THINK RITA
WAS MUCH OF A DRINKER AT ALL.

09:47.710 --> 09:50.235
THERE'S NOT A DROP OF ALCOHOL
ANYWHERE ELSE AROUND HERE.

09:50.280 --> 09:51.360
WAS SHE EMPLOYED?

09:51.410 --> 09:52.752
YEAH. PERSONAL NURSE.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.678
UH, WORKED THE OVERNIGHT
SHIFT AT PRIVATE HOMES.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.768
ACCORDING TO GARCIA,
NO MEN IN HER LIFE.

09:57.810 --> 09:58.845
THE NEIGHBORS SAID
SHE WAS QUIET,

09:58.900 --> 10:00.060
KEPT TO HERSELF
MAINLY,

10:00.120 --> 10:01.985
WAS FAIRLY
ACTIVE IN CHURCH.

10:02.030 --> 10:04.555
WELL, HER LIVING SPACE
CERTAINLY REFLECT S THAT.

10:04.600 --> 10:07.160
OLD-FASHIONED WARDROBE,

10:07.210 --> 10:10.384
MUSIC COLLECTION FROM
YOUR GRANDPARENTS' TIME.

10:10.430 --> 10:12.819
HER BOOKS ARE MOSTLY
ROMANCE NOVELS.

10:12.870 --> 10:15.213
STEAMY ONES AT THAT.

10:15.260 --> 10:17.865
MAYBE THERE'S ANOTHER RITA
DEEP INSIDE TRYING TO ESCAPE.

10:17.920 --> 10:21.048
OR DID ESCAPE.

10:21.090 --> 10:22.785
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT
GOT HER KILLED.

10:22.830 --> 10:25.572
WE NEED TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK
AT THE OTHER VICTIMS.

10:25.620 --> 10:29.226
MAYBE THEY ALL HAVE
SOMETHING BREWING
BENEATH THE SURFACE.

10:32.020 --> 10:33.237
YOU IN THE MIDDLE
OF ANYTHING?

10:33.280 --> 10:35.236
BLACK CHERRY
DELICIOUSNESS.

10:35.280 --> 10:37.407
WHY ANY MORTAL
WOULD EAT ANY--OH!

10:37.460 --> 10:38.882
VISITORS!

10:38.940 --> 10:41.067
PENELOPE, I WOULD LIKE
TO INTRODUCE YOU

10:41.110 --> 10:44.068
TO PORTIA RICHARDS,
WICK ROLLINS,

10:44.120 --> 10:45.678
AND KRYSTALL RICHARDS.

10:45.730 --> 10:46.890
WITH A "K" AND TWO Ls.

10:46.950 --> 10:48.599
OH, IT'S SO NICE
TO MEET YOU.

10:48.640 --> 10:50.244
YOUR REPUTATION
PRECEDES YOU.

10:50.300 --> 10:51.244
I'VE HEARD SO MUCH
ABOUT YOU.

10:51.300 --> 10:52.255
GOOD STUFF. NOT GOOD

10:52.300 --> 10:53.517
IN THE CONVENTIONAL SENSE,

10:53.560 --> 10:55.118
BUT NOT ANYTHING
THAT I DON'T APPROVE OF.

10:55.170 --> 10:56.421
DOUBLE NEGATIVE. SORRY.

10:56.480 --> 10:57.424
IT'S JUST

10:57.480 --> 10:59.254
PEOPLE ARE SO JUDGMENTAL,

10:59.310 --> 11:00.823
AND THEY SHOULDN'T BE
JUDGMENTAL,

11:00.870 --> 11:02.303
AND THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M GONNA DO. BE.

11:02.350 --> 11:03.692
JUDGMENTAL.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.696
IT IS A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU,
PENELOPE.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.445
AND THE LADIES
WERE WONDERING

11:08.490 --> 11:10.924
IF YOU COULD ESCORT THEM
TO THE RESTROOM.

11:10.970 --> 11:12.835
I--I CAN DO THAT.
IT'S THIS WAY.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.279
I'LL BE IN MY OFFICE
WITH WICK.

11:14.320 --> 11:16.709
GARCIA: THERE YOU GO.
DOWN THIS HALL.

11:16.760 --> 11:19.752
SHE'S QUITE THE CHARACTER.
IS SHE ALWAYS LIKE THAT?

11:19.800 --> 11:23.327
LUCKILY FOR US, YES.

11:23.370 --> 11:25.452
MY OFFICE IS THIS WAY.

11:27.460 --> 11:29.109
OH, WOW.

11:29.160 --> 11:31.025
A FELLOW MARINE
GAVE THAT TO ME

11:31.080 --> 11:32.729
SHORTLY BEFORE HE DIED.

11:32.770 --> 11:34.943
THERE'S A PORTION OF
THE VIETNAM VETERANS MEMORIAL

11:34.990 --> 11:36.332
ENGRAVED ON IT.

11:36.390 --> 11:37.596
YOU SHOOT?

11:37.650 --> 11:39.345
I DO. TRIED OUT
FOR THE OLYMPIC TEAM,

11:39.390 --> 11:40.732
10-METER AIR RIFLE.

11:40.780 --> 11:42.645
WOW. WELL,
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

11:42.700 --> 11:44.600
WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED
IN A SESSION

11:44.660 --> 11:46.309
AT THE FBI FIRING RANGE?

11:46.350 --> 11:47.783
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

11:47.830 --> 11:50.094
I'LL SET IT UP
FOR LATER TODAY.

11:54.530 --> 11:55.963
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

11:56.010 --> 11:58.797
THIS GIRL YOU'RE
MARRYING IS HILARIOUS.

11:58.840 --> 12:01.536
WELL, LET US IN
ON THE JOKE, HONEY.

12:01.590 --> 12:05.276
OH, I WAS JUST...
TELLING A STORY.

12:05.330 --> 12:07.195
WHAT STORY WOULD THAT BE?

12:07.240 --> 12:09.196
OH, IT WAS ONE OF THOSE
YOU HAD TO BE THERE

12:09.250 --> 12:11.115
KIND OF THINGS.

12:13.210 --> 12:15.337
KRYSTALL: THIS HAS
BEEN A GREAT TOUR,

12:15.380 --> 12:17.371
BUT WE'VE GOT SOME
LAST-MINUTE SHOPPING

12:17.430 --> 12:18.772
TO CATCH UP ON.

12:18.820 --> 12:20.947
WE STILL ON FOR DINNER
AT YOUR PLACE TONIGHT?

12:21.000 --> 12:23.560
LINGUINI A LA ROSSI.
BRING YOUR APPETITES.

12:25.910 --> 12:27.343
GARCIA: IT'S QUITE GOOD.

12:27.390 --> 12:29.438
IT'S A VEGETARIAN...

12:34.710 --> 12:35.916
TALKED TO STEVEN GOURSE.

12:35.970 --> 12:38.097
CONFIRMED BOTH HE
AND MURIEL ARE NONSMOKERS

12:38.140 --> 12:40.358
BUT ADMITTED HIS WIFE
WOULD SNEAK A CIGARETTE

12:40.410 --> 12:41.798
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,
USUALLY LATE AT NIGHT.

12:41.840 --> 12:43.239
SHE SUFFERED
FROM INSOMNIA.

12:43.280 --> 12:44.668
WAS IT POSSIBLE
SHE HID THEM IN THE OVEN?

12:44.720 --> 12:46.847
SHE KNEW HER HUSBAND
WAS WISE TO HER,

12:46.890 --> 12:49.711
AND PLUS STEVEN SAID
THE BRAND WASN'T EVEN
THE KIND SHE SMOKED.

12:49.760 --> 12:51.716
ANOTHER THING.
NONE OF AMANDA'S FRIENDS

12:51.770 --> 12:53.806
REMEMBER EVER SEEING
HER WEARING THE NECKLACE

12:53.860 --> 12:55.282
THAT WAS FOUND ON HER BODY.

12:55.330 --> 12:58.072
SHE LIKED HIGH-END JEWELRY,
AND THAT NECKLACE WAS CHEAP.

12:58.120 --> 12:59.291
MAYBE THE UNSUB
BROUGHT IT WITH HIM,

12:59.340 --> 13:00.557
LIKE HE DID THE ALCOHOL
WITH RITA

13:00.600 --> 13:01.817
AND THE CIGARETTES
WITH MURIEL.

13:01.860 --> 13:04.249
IT COULD BE HIS OWN
UNIQUE FORM OF SADISM.

13:04.300 --> 13:06.814
NOT ONLY DID HE DISPENSE
PHYSICAL PAIN,

13:06.870 --> 13:08.167
BUT AT THE MOMENT OF DEATH,

13:08.220 --> 13:12.088
HE INFLICT ED A PSYCHOLOGICAL
WOUND AS WELL.

13:34.850 --> 13:37.501
VICTIM'S DEE STOCKTON.
SINGLE, LIVED ALONE.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.506
THERE'S NO SIGNS
OF A STRUGGLE INSIDE,

13:39.550 --> 13:41.336
SO IT MUST HAVE ALL
GONE DOWN OUT HERE.

13:41.380 --> 13:43.848
A SINGLE STAB WOUND
TO THE BACK
LIKE THE OTHERS,

13:43.910 --> 13:46.720
BUT DRENCHED
FROM THE NECK UP.

13:46.780 --> 13:49.681
I'M THINKING THE UNSUB
PROBABLY PUT HER HEAD
IN THE FOUNTAIN.

13:49.740 --> 13:52.561
HE BRINGS AN ITEM
TO EACH CRIME SCENE, RIGHT?

13:52.610 --> 13:54.862
SO WHAT DOESN'T
BELONG HERE?

13:54.920 --> 13:57.263
MAYBE NOW HE'S PLAYING
HIDE-AND-SEEK.

13:57.310 --> 13:59.437
THERE'S BOOZE, CIGARETTES,

13:59.490 --> 14:01.651
A CHEAP PEARL NECKLACE.

14:01.710 --> 14:04.929
I MEAN, I GUESS
IF YOU CONSIDER JEWELRY
WASTEFUL SPENDING,

14:04.970 --> 14:07.575
THEN THOSE ALL QUALIFY
AS VICES.

14:07.620 --> 14:09.576
WELL, THEY COULD BE
THE UNSUB'S VICES.

14:09.630 --> 14:13.885
HE DRINKS, HE SMOKES,
AND TOO BROKE TO BUY
DECENT JEWELRY.

14:13.940 --> 14:16.067
IT WOULD PROVE
THE REJECT ED LOVER THEORY.

14:16.110 --> 14:19.329
I MEAN, IF HE THINKS
THAT'S WHY THESE WOMEN
SPURNED HIM,

14:19.380 --> 14:21.154
MAYBE IT'S PAYBACK.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.805
YOU KNOW, REID AND JJ
SAID THAT RITA

14:23.860 --> 14:25.987
HAD AN OLD-TIME MUSIC
COLLECTION.

14:26.030 --> 14:28.078
YEAH, WORLD WAR II
ERA STUFF.

14:28.120 --> 14:30.031
GARCIA, HEY, I NEED YOU

14:30.080 --> 14:32.947
TO CHECK THE POLICE INVENTORY
ON AMANDA CORLISS' APARTMENT.

14:33.000 --> 14:37.562
WE'RE TRYING TO FIND OUT
WHAT KIND OF MUSIC
SHE LISTENED TO.

14:37.610 --> 14:42.001
OK. SO DEE'S MUSIC WAS
MOSTLY THIRTIES AND FORTIES.

14:42.050 --> 14:44.871
I KNOW AMANDA IS
A LOT YOUNGER, BUT IT--

14:44.920 --> 14:46.319
YEAH. GARCIA.

14:48.450 --> 14:51.613
OK. THAN KS.

14:54.280 --> 14:58.751
AMANDA HAD AN EXTENSIVE
COLLECTION OF BIG BAND MUSIC.

14:58.810 --> 15:00.619
WE WEREN'T BEING
SPECIFIC ENOUGH.

15:00.680 --> 15:02.102
ABOUT WHAT?

15:02.160 --> 15:03.673
WELL, IT WASN'T JUST BOOZE.

15:03.720 --> 15:05.449
IT WAS RUM AND COCA-COLA.

15:05.510 --> 15:06.670
AND IT WASN'T JUST JEWELRY.

15:06.730 --> 15:08.459
IT WAS A DIME STORE
PEARL NECKLACE.

15:08.510 --> 15:12.514
THE CIGARETTES WERE ABOUT
PUTTING HER HEAD IN SMOKE.

15:12.560 --> 15:14.812
"RUM AND COCA-COLA,'l
"STRING OF PEARLS,"

15:14.870 --> 15:15.939
"SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES,"

15:16.000 --> 15:17.649
SONG TITLES.
YEAH.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.956
HOW DID YOU PULL THAT
OUT OF THIN AIR?

15:21.000 --> 15:22.433
NOT AIR.

15:22.480 --> 15:24.528
WATER.

15:26.790 --> 15:29.577
ALVEZ: "THREE COINS
IN THE FOUNTAIN."

15:29.620 --> 15:32.703
WE'RE LOOKING FOR A MALE,
PROBABLY IN HIS 405 OR 505.

15:32.750 --> 15:34.445
HE'S BRAZEN AND CONFIDENT.

15:34.490 --> 15:36.833
ALVEZ: AND THE UNSUB MIGHT
BE ROMANTICALLY INVOLVED

15:36.890 --> 15:37.879
WITH THE WOMEN HE'S KILLING.

15:37.930 --> 15:39.318
WE BELIEVE
HE BROUGHT A NECKLACE

15:39.370 --> 15:40.758
TO ONE OF THE CRIME SCENES,

15:40.800 --> 15:42.939
AND HE ALWAYS LEAVES BEHIND
A SINGLE RED ROSE.

15:42.980 --> 15:46.029
GIVEN THE DIVERSITY IN AGE,
TYPE, AND ETHNICITY,

15:46.070 --> 15:49.767
THIS PERSON
IS NOT ZEROING IN ON
A SPECIFIC SURROGATE.

15:49.810 --> 15:50.799
PRENTISS: AND THE PERSON
WE'RE LOOKING FOR

15:50.860 --> 15:52.680
IS MORE IN
THE TED BUNDY MOLD.

15:52.730 --> 15:55.164
HE'S HAN DSOME,
CHARMING, PERSONABLE.

15:55.210 --> 15:57.258
HE'S THE TYPE OF MAN
YOU WOULD PROBABLY
BE DRAWN TO

15:57.300 --> 15:58.733
IN A SOCIAL SETTING.

15:58.780 --> 16:01.089
THIS MAY BE A CLASSIC CASE
OF CASANOVA COMPLEX,

16:01.130 --> 16:03.166
A PSYCHOLOGICAL TERM
GIVEN TO MEN

16:03.220 --> 16:04.733
WHO MOVE
FROM LOVER TO LOVER,

16:04.780 --> 16:06.736
DISCARDING THEM
THE MOMENT
THEY'VE BEEN CONQUERED.

16:06.790 --> 16:08.564
THE VICTIMS WERE
PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE

16:08.610 --> 16:09.918
TO THIS TYPE OF SEDUCTION.

16:09.960 --> 16:12.303
AMANDA CORLISS WAS
UNHAPPILY PROMISCUOUS.

16:12.360 --> 16:14.009
MURIEL GOURSE WAS IN
A TROUBLED MARRIAGE.

16:14.060 --> 16:16.620
RITA FRAZEE LIVED VICARIOUSLY
THROUGH ROMANCE NOVELS.

16:16.670 --> 16:19.138
MUSIC IS SUPREMELY IMPORTANT
TO THIS UNSUB'S RITUAL,

16:19.190 --> 16:22.409
PARTICULARLY POPULAR MUSIC
FROM THE THIRTIES,
FORTIES, AND FIFTIES,

16:22.450 --> 16:24.714
AND IT MAY IN FACT
BE PART OF THE RUSE HE USES

16:24.760 --> 16:26.751
TO LURE HIS VICTIMS IN.

16:26.810 --> 16:28.414
ALVEZ: WE HAVE NO REASON
TO THINK HE'LL STOP NOW.

16:28.460 --> 16:30.018
FOR HIM, THIS IS A HUNT.

16:30.070 --> 16:31.981
AND INTRINSIC TO THE HUNT

16:32.030 --> 16:33.986
IS THE ANTICIPATION
OF THE NEXT VICTIM.

16:34.030 --> 16:35.372
THANK YOU ALL.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.990
HEY. AREN'T YOU
SUPPOSED TO BE,

16:40.040 --> 16:41.905
LIKE, UP TO YOUR ELBOWS
IN FETTUCCINI?

16:41.950 --> 16:44.214
LINGUINI.
BUT IT'S NOT TILL 8:00.

16:44.260 --> 16:45.909
LISTEN, DO YOU THINK
YOU COULD QUICKLY

16:45.960 --> 16:48.042
CHECK OUT SOMETHING
FOR ME?

16:48.090 --> 16:49.216
SURE. WHAT?

16:49.260 --> 16:50.739
IT'S WICK.

16:50.790 --> 16:53.213
THIS AFTERNOON
AT THE SHOOTING RANGE,

16:53.270 --> 16:57.309
ONE OF OUR YOUNG
FEMALE AGENTS WAS
IN THE NEXT BOOTH.

16:57.360 --> 17:01.797
AND WHEN WICK NOTICED
THAT SHE WAS A BETTER
SHOT THAN HE WAS...

17:01.840 --> 17:02.795
HE DIDN'T TAKE IT WELL?

17:02.840 --> 17:04.273
NO. NOT AT ALL.

17:04.320 --> 17:06.049
HE TRIED TO MASK IT,

17:06.110 --> 17:08.066
BUT HIS CAROTID
WAS POUNDING,

17:08.110 --> 17:09.930
HIS AIM GOT WORSE.

17:09.980 --> 17:13.632
AND--AND EARLIER,
IN MY OFFICE,

17:13.680 --> 17:17.241
WHEN PORTIA HAD
YOU ALL LAUGHING,

17:17.290 --> 17:19.758
DID YOU NOTICE HOW
HE SHUT HER DOWN?

17:19.820 --> 17:20.946
YES. HE ABSOLUTELY
SHUT HER DOWN.

17:20.990 --> 17:22.981
THE COERCIVE CONTROL
OF A MISOGYNIST.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.428
IT'S TEXTBOOK.
UH-HUH.

17:24.470 --> 17:26.199
I CAN VET HIM.
LET ME VET HIM.
I WILL VET HIM.

17:26.260 --> 17:27.386
PENELOPE...

17:27.430 --> 17:28.738
SIR, BY THE TIME
I AM DONE,

17:28.780 --> 17:30.998
YOU WILL KNOW
ABOUT MR. WICK ROLLINS

17:31.050 --> 17:32.176
OF SAVANNAH, GEORGIA,
YOU WILL KNOW

17:32.220 --> 17:33.949
WHAT COLOR
HIS SHOELACES ARE,

17:34.000 --> 17:36.651
YOU WILL KNOW WHETHER
HE'S AN INNIE OR AN OUTIE--
BELLYBUTTON.

17:36.700 --> 17:39.874
PENELOPE, NO.
I JUST WANT A SIMPLE
BACKGROUND CHECK.

17:39.920 --> 17:42.798
I DON'T WANT YOU
DIGGING INTO EVERY
NOOK AND CRANNY.

17:42.840 --> 17:46.139
OH, NO, SIR, THAT'S
WHERE THE BAD STUFF IS
YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT.

17:46.190 --> 17:49.102
THAT'S WHAT MAKES
A NOOK A NOOK
AND A CRANNY A CRANNY.

17:49.150 --> 17:50.629
YOU GOTTA GET--

17:52.850 --> 17:57.059
OK. I'LL LIMIT MY SEARCH
TO A LEVEL ONE.

17:57.110 --> 18:00.853
THANK YOU. CALL ME
IF YOU FIND ANYTHING.

18:02.160 --> 18:04.890
LEVEL TWO, MAX.

18:04.950 --> 18:06.110
MAYBE 2 1/2.

18:06.170 --> 18:08.900
JAREAU: SO THE M.E.
SAID DEE STOCKTON

18:08.950 --> 18:10.599
WASN'T SEXUALLY ASSAU LTED.

18:10.650 --> 18:12.470
OH, SO NONE OF
THE VICTIMS WERE.

18:12.520 --> 18:15.307
PRENTISS: NOW, THERE'S
A BASIC QUESTION WAY UPSTREAM

18:15.350 --> 18:16.521
THAT WE
HAVEN'T ANSWERED YET.

18:16.570 --> 18:19.130
HOW IS THE UNSUB
MEETING THESE WOMEN?

18:19.180 --> 18:21.307
BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE
MORE THAN ONE ENCOUNTER.

18:21.360 --> 18:24.318
THE RITUAL OF COURTSHIP
TAKES TIME.

18:24.360 --> 18:27.659
THE ONLY OVERLAP
WE HAVE AT THIS POINT
IS VINTAGE MUSIC.

18:27.710 --> 18:29.701
THE KILLER COULD BE
A MUSICIAN,

18:29.760 --> 18:31.751
COULD OWN A RECORD STORE,

18:31.800 --> 18:33.620
OR JUST SHARE
THE INTEREST.

18:33.670 --> 18:35.888
STEVEN GOURSE TOLD MATT
THAT HIS WIFE

18:35.940 --> 18:37.669
SUFFERED FROM INSOMNIA,
RIGHT?

18:37.720 --> 18:40.154
YEAH. WHY?
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

18:40.200 --> 18:41.849
REID: MURIEL GOURSE
HAD TROUBLE SLEEPING,

18:41.900 --> 18:43.765
AMANDA WENT CLUBBING
EVERY NIGHT,

18:43.810 --> 18:48.429
AND RITA WAS AN R.N.
WHO WORKED
THE GRAVEYARD SHIFT.

18:48.470 --> 18:51.689
THE VICTIMS ARE AWAKE WHEN
THE REST OF THE WORLD SLEEPS.

18:51.730 --> 18:53.038
THAT HAS TO BE THE WINDOW

18:53.080 --> 18:55.901
OUR UNSUB IS
EXPLOITING, BUT HOW?

18:55.960 --> 18:58.520
AND WHO'S HE
TARGETING NEXT?

18:58.570 --> 19:01.471
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT CHANGED.

19:01.530 --> 19:03.612
IT'S NOT YOU, JANICE,
IT'S ME.

19:03.660 --> 19:06.436
I KNOW THAT!
WHAT I DON'T KNOW IS WHY.

19:06.490 --> 19:10.005
LOOK. I GOT A LOT
OF THINGS ON MY MIND.

19:10.060 --> 19:12.051
WELL, WHY DON'T WE GET OUT
OF TOWN FOR A COUPLE DAYS?

19:12.100 --> 19:14.182
WE COULD FIND SOME
ROMANTIC LITTLE B&B.

19:14.240 --> 19:17.368
I RESPECT YOU TOO MUCH
TO PLAY GAMES, JANICE.

19:17.410 --> 19:20.800
WE NEED TO MOVE ON,
BOTH OF US.

19:20.850 --> 19:22.158
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

19:22.200 --> 19:23.849
YOU'RE REALLY BREAKING UP
WITH ME?

19:26.730 --> 19:30.245
AREN'T YOU GONNA
ANSWER THAT?

19:30.290 --> 19:33.908
IT'S YOUR WIFE,
ISN'T IT?

19:33.950 --> 19:36.032
I'M LATE FOR MY PROGRAM.

19:37.650 --> 19:39.641
SCREW YOU, CRAIG!

19:39.700 --> 19:42.385
AND SCREW YOUR RESPECT!

19:48.050 --> 19:50.655
ROMANCE, LATE NIGHT,
AND WORLD WAR II MUSIC.

19:50.710 --> 19:52.792
WHERE DO THESE 3 THINGS
COME TOGETHER?

19:52.840 --> 19:55.889
RETRO NIGHT CLUB, CONCERT,

19:55.930 --> 19:59.752
MAYBE A BAR WITH RAT PACK
STYLE ENTERTAINMENT.

19:59.800 --> 20:02.109
YEAH, BUT THOSE
VENUES DON'T FIT

20:02.150 --> 20:03.754
RITA OR MURIEL'S
LIFESTYLES.

20:03.810 --> 20:06.938
I MEAN, THEY WERE BOTH
SHY, STAY-AT-HOME TYPES.

20:06.980 --> 20:08.151
WHAT ABOUT RADIO?

20:08.200 --> 20:09.929
WHAT ABOUT IT?

20:09.990 --> 20:11.150
WELL, LATE-NIGHT RADIO,

20:11.210 --> 20:12.541
IT CAN BE ALL
OF THESE THINGS.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.761
THE MUSIC, THE INTIMACY,

20:14.820 --> 20:16.640
THE SEDUCT IVE VOICE
REACHING OUT OF THE NIGHT

20:16.690 --> 20:19.204
INTO THE PRIVACY
OF YOUR OWN HOME.

20:19.260 --> 20:21.387
OUR UNSUB COULD BE A DJ.

20:21.430 --> 20:24.729
T-MINUS 4 MINUTES, DUDE.
CUTTING IT CLOSE.

20:27.700 --> 20:30.305
HEY. WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

20:30.350 --> 20:32.739
I CALLED YOUR CELL,
BUT YOU DIDN'T PICK UP.

20:32.790 --> 20:34.439
I HAVE TO GO
TO MY MOTHER'S.

20:34.490 --> 20:37.220
WHAT, NOW? TOMORROW
AFTERNOON WE'RE SUPPOSED TO--

20:37.270 --> 20:39.272
I KNOW. SHE FORGOT
SHE HAD A DOCTOR'S
APPOINTMENT

20:39.320 --> 20:41.140
FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING.

20:41.190 --> 20:44.273
DON'T WORRY.
I'LL BE BACK IN TIME.

20:44.330 --> 20:46.013
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

20:50.160 --> 20:52.321
I'M NERVOUS.

20:52.380 --> 20:53.722
ABOUT WHAT?

20:53.770 --> 20:56.079
RENEWING OUR VOWS.

20:56.120 --> 20:58.293
YOU'RE NOT HAVING
SECOND THOUGHTS, ARE YOU?

20:58.340 --> 21:00.774
I WAS GONNA ASK YOU
THE SAME THING.

21:00.820 --> 21:02.515
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

21:02.560 --> 21:04.994
I KNOW. IT'S JUST...

21:05.040 --> 21:08.305
YOU'VE BEEN ACTING
SO DIFFERENT LATELY.

21:08.350 --> 21:11.524
I'M SORRY. IT JUST--
IT MEANS A LOT TO ME.

21:11.570 --> 21:13.435
IT'S--IT'S EVERYTHING.

21:13.480 --> 21:14.959
AND TO ME.

21:15.010 --> 21:17.228
EVERYTHING I DO
IS FOR YOU.

21:17.270 --> 21:19.738
PLAY MY SONG TONIGHT?

21:19.800 --> 21:23.019
I'LL PLAY IT TWICE.

21:23.060 --> 21:25.187
YOU HAVE A GREAT SHOW.

21:25.240 --> 21:29.882
SPRINKLE SOME HAPPINESS
TO ALL THE PEOPLE
OUT THERE.

21:41.160 --> 21:44.641
I BET THAT SPRINKLER'S
ALREADY BEEN DOING
SOME WATERING TONIGHT.

21:44.690 --> 21:46.385
HOW IS JANICE, ANYWAY?

21:46.430 --> 21:50.161
WE'RE DONE. NOT THAT
IT'S ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS.

21:50.220 --> 21:52.211
5 SECONDS.

21:55.740 --> 21:58.356
GOOD EVENING.
THIS IS CRAIG KALINE,

21:58.400 --> 22:00.174
AND WELCOME TO THE NIGHT.

22:00.230 --> 22:03.051
THE POET T.S. ELIOT SAID,

22:03.100 --> 22:05.273
"LET US GO, THEN, YOU AND I,

22:05.320 --> 22:09.359
"WHEN THE EVENING IS
SPREAD OUT AGAINST THE SKY,

22:09.410 --> 22:13.756
LIKE A PATIENT ETHERIZED
UPON A TABLE."

22:13.810 --> 22:15.232
FOR THE NEXT 6 HOURS,

22:15.290 --> 22:17.064
WHILE THE REST
OF THE CITY SLEEPS,

22:17.110 --> 22:18.930
WE'LL BE DANCING
IN THE DARK,

22:18.980 --> 22:21.289
JUST YOU AND ME.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.729
THIS IS OUR TIME,

22:23.770 --> 22:28.116
THE TIME OF ETHERIZED
WAKEFULNESS.

22:28.170 --> 22:30.559
I'M SERIOUSLY GONNA HURL.

22:38.440 --> 22:41.489
GOTTA BE OVER 100
RADIO STATIONS IN CHICAGO.

22:41.530 --> 22:43.430
106 IF YOU COUNT
HIGH-FREQUENCY OUTLETS

22:43.490 --> 22:45.390
LOCATED WITHIN THE CITY'S
LISTENING RANGE.

22:45.450 --> 22:47.099
WELL, GARCIA'S GOING OVER
THE VICTIMS' PHONE RECORDS,

22:47.140 --> 22:49.096
SO IF IT WAS A CALL-IN
REQUEST-TYPE THING,

22:49.150 --> 22:51.277
MAYBE A NUMBER REPEATS
ITSELF.

22:51.320 --> 22:52.969
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE
ISN'T A STATION IN THE CITY

22:53.020 --> 22:55.056
THAT EXCLUSIVELY PROGRAMS
BIG BAND MUSIC.

22:55.110 --> 22:56.589
MAYBE AN OCCASIONAL
VINTAGE SONG

22:56.630 --> 22:59.326
IS FOLDED INTO THE BODY
OF A DIFFERENT FORMAT.

22:59.370 --> 23:01.326
PRENTISS: WELL, IT'S
GONNA BE A LONG NIGHT.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.371
LET'S GET ON IT.

23:14.130 --> 23:15.290
THANKS. GARCIA SAID
NONE OF THE VICTIMS

23:15.350 --> 23:17.124
CALLED IN TO ANY
RADIO STATIONS.

23:17.170 --> 23:19.434
ALL RIGHT. WE MAY NOT
BE LOOKING

23:19.480 --> 23:21.994
AT CONVENTIONAL AM-FM
RADIO STATIONS.

23:22.050 --> 23:24.826
I MEAN, THERE'S--
THERE'S SATELLITE
AND INTERNET RADIO, TOO.

23:24.880 --> 23:27.519
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
THOUSANDS OF NICHE
PROGRAMS OUT THERE.

23:27.580 --> 23:30.140
GREAT. SO OUR HAYSTACK
JUST GOT A WHOLE LOT BIGGER.

23:30.190 --> 23:33.614
WHAT CONCERNS ME
IS THE PACE OF THE KILLINGS.

23:33.670 --> 23:35.319
I MEAN,
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF.

23:35.370 --> 23:37.315
THE SEDUCTION RUSE
IS A LONG CON.

23:37.370 --> 23:39.235
I MEAN, IT TAKES TIME
TO SET THE BAIT,

23:39.280 --> 23:40.679
REEL THE VICTIMS IN.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.938
THESE WOMEN HAVE BEEN
IN PLAY FOR A WHILE.

23:42.980 --> 23:45.062
THE COMPRESSED TIMELINE
IS CONCERNING.

23:45.110 --> 23:47.988
BUT WHY ISN'T
HE GRADUALLY KILLING

23:48.030 --> 23:49.986
AS HE PHASES IN
NEW VICTIMS?

23:50.030 --> 23:52.373
WHEN INVADING ARMIES
ARE FLEEING TERRITORY

23:52.430 --> 23:53.590
THEY'VE OCCUPIED
FOR A WHILE,

23:53.640 --> 23:55.517
OFTEN THEY'LL BURN THEM
TO THE GROUND.

23:55.560 --> 23:57.949
THAT REMINDS ME OF THE WAY
THIS UNSUB

23:58.000 --> 24:00.514
IS PUTTING THE TORCH
TO HIS ROMANCES.

24:00.560 --> 24:02.824
HE'S ON THE RUN.

24:02.870 --> 24:04.690
HE KNOWS
THE END IS NEAR,

24:04.740 --> 24:06.788
JUST LIKE IN WAR,
WHICH MEANS

24:06.830 --> 24:09.355
HE'S CLOSING IN
ON HIS ENDGAME.

24:10.790 --> 24:13.657
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT
A LITTLE DISTRACT ED
THERE, WICK.

24:13.710 --> 24:16.349
THINKING ABOUT YOUR
HONEYMOON NIGHT INSTEAD?

24:16.410 --> 24:17.399
MOM!

24:17.450 --> 24:18.667
WHAT?!

24:18.710 --> 24:19.972
THE WEAPON WASN'T
CALIBRATED RIGHT.

24:21.060 --> 24:23.233
THANK YOU, MR. ROSSI,

24:23.280 --> 24:25.419
THAT WAS
AN INCREDIBLE DINNER.

24:25.460 --> 24:27.189
THE PLEASURE WAS MINE.

24:27.240 --> 24:29.674
BUT, PLEASE, MR. ROSSI
WAS MY FATHER.

24:31.900 --> 24:34.812
JUST GIVE ME ONE MINUTE,
PLEASE.

24:36.770 --> 24:38.294
YOU'RE POSITIVE?

24:38.340 --> 24:39.511
I AM TRIPLE POSITIVE.

24:39.560 --> 24:41.471
WICK ROLLINS HAS BEEN
ENGAGED TO 3 WOMEN

24:41.520 --> 24:43.772
IN THE LAST 3 YEARS,
AND THEY ALL FELL THROUGH.

24:43.830 --> 24:44.956
WHY?

24:45.000 --> 24:45.989
I DON'T KNOW.

24:46.040 --> 24:47.382
I DO KNOW
THAT IN EACH CASE

24:47.440 --> 24:49.214
THE WOULD-BE BRIDES
HAD SUPER RICH PARENTS

24:49.270 --> 24:52.876
AND WICK WALKED AWAY
WITH A HEFTY FINANCIAL
SETTLEMENT.

24:52.920 --> 24:54.399
HE IS A CON ARTIST.

24:54.440 --> 24:56.920
KRYSTALL SAID THAT
PORTIA'S FATHER HAS MONEY.

24:56.970 --> 24:58.619
DOES WICK HAVE
A CRIMINAL RECORD?

24:58.670 --> 25:01.309
NOT OFFICIALLY.
HE DOES HAVE TWO ACCOUNTS

25:01.360 --> 25:03.055
OF DOMESTIC ASSAULT.

25:03.110 --> 25:04.407
BOTH TIMES THE CHARGES
WERE DROPPED.

25:04.450 --> 25:06.361
HE DOES HAVE MULTIPLE
RESTRAINING ORDERS.

25:06.410 --> 25:08.275
HE IS SUPER BAD NEWS.

25:08.330 --> 25:09.979
THANKS, PENELOPE.

25:11.850 --> 25:13.408
YEAH, WE'D LOVE TO.

25:13.460 --> 25:16.509
IT'S JUST THAT OUR REQUEST
LINES ARE ALREADY--

25:16.550 --> 25:20.850
OK. I'LL CONVEY THAT
TO HIM.

25:22.730 --> 25:25.255
THAT WAS JANICE.
SHE'D LIKE YOU TO PLAY

25:25.300 --> 25:27.256
"DIAMONDS ARE A GIRL'S
BEST FRIEND,"

25:27.300 --> 25:28.642
JUST FOR HER.

25:28.700 --> 25:30.509
FORGET IT.

25:30.570 --> 25:34.609
YEAH. UM, THING IS
THERE'S AN INCENTIVE CLAUSE.

25:34.660 --> 25:35.786
IF SHE DOESN'T
HEAR THE SONG,

25:35.830 --> 25:38.139
SHE'S GONNA HAVE A CHAT
WITH CHERYL.

25:40.970 --> 25:43.575
PLAY IT.

25:43.620 --> 25:44.757
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

25:44.800 --> 25:46.756
WE'VE STILL GOT
ANOTHER HOUR HERE.

25:46.800 --> 25:50.065
PUT ON A "BEST OF."

25:54.590 --> 25:56.501
JAREAU: MORNING, SPENCE.
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

25:56.550 --> 25:57.721
THE UNSUB'S GROWING
HIS OWN ROSES.

25:57.770 --> 25:58.850
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT?

25:58.900 --> 25:59.935
WELL, THE BRANCHING PATTERNS

25:59.990 --> 26:01.469
AND LACK OF FUNGAL
CONTAMINATION

26:01.510 --> 26:02.943
ASSOCIATED WITH GREENHOUSES.

26:02.990 --> 26:04.946
GARDEN ROSES AREN'T
AS COSMETICALLY PERFECT

26:04.990 --> 26:06.594
AS FLORIST ROSES,
BUT THEY'RE HEALTHIER

26:06.650 --> 26:08.868
AND HAVE STURDIER
LEAF GROWTH, LIKE THIS ONE.

26:08.910 --> 26:12.607
SO OUR UNSUB LIVES
IN THE GREATER CHICAGO AREA

26:12.650 --> 26:14.299
WITH A ROSE GARDEN.

26:14.350 --> 26:16.523
WELL, WE SHOULD HAVE
THIS CASE WRAPPED
BY NOON.

26:16.570 --> 26:17.787
HOW'S GARCIA'S
PHONE SEARCH COMING?

26:17.830 --> 26:19.821
NOTHING. SHE IS LOOKING
INTO CHAT, MESSAGING,

26:19.880 --> 26:22.440
SOCIAL POSTS,
BUT IT TAKES TIME.

26:22.490 --> 26:25.004
RITA WAS A PRIVATE NURSE
IN OTHER PEOPLE'S HOMES, RIGHT?

26:25.060 --> 26:26.539
YEAH. WHY?

26:26.580 --> 26:29.185
WELL, MAYBE SHE USED
ONE OF HER PATIENTS' PHONES.

26:37.850 --> 26:41.456
YOU JUST MADE
A HUGE MISTAKE.

26:44.550 --> 26:45.551
HEY, GARCIA.

26:45.600 --> 26:46.897
YOU GUYS WERE RIGHT.

26:46.950 --> 26:49.942
ONE OF RITA'S PATIENTS
IS JOANNE WILLIS,

26:49.990 --> 26:52.299
AND THERE WERE MULTIPLE CALLS
FROM THE WILLIS RESIDENCE

26:52.340 --> 26:53.955
IN THE WEE SMALL HOURS

26:54.000 --> 26:55.513
TO AN INTERNET RADIO STATION
IN CHICAGO.

26:55.570 --> 26:56.730
THAT COULD BE IT.

26:56.780 --> 26:58.736
AND WHAT'S
THE STATION'S FORMAT?

26:58.790 --> 27:00.087
SONGS TO BE AN UNSUB BY,

27:00.140 --> 27:01.619
WHICH IN THIS CASE IS
SONGS FROM THE THIRTIES,

27:01.660 --> 27:02.957
FORTIES, AND FIFTIES.

27:03.010 --> 27:04.830
IT IS A LIVE CALL-IN SHOW

27:04.880 --> 27:07.485
HOSTED BY CRAIG KALINE NIGHTLY,

27:07.530 --> 27:08.929
AND IT JUST WENT OFF THE AIR.

27:08.970 --> 27:11.222
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.927
DID CRAIG SAY
WHERE HE WAS GOING?

27:16.980 --> 27:18.368
HE JUST BOLTED.

27:18.410 --> 27:20.150
NORMALLY I'D SAY
IT'S SOME WOMAN.

27:20.200 --> 27:22.282
CRAIG WAS A LITTLE
OVERWIRED THAT WAY.

27:22.330 --> 27:24.195
WHY WOULDN'T YOU
SAY THAT NOW?

27:24.250 --> 27:26.673
TODAY'S THE DAY HE'S RENEWING
HIS VOWS WITH HIS WIFE.

27:26.730 --> 27:29.551
YOU'D THINK THE GUY
COULD KEEP IT TUCKED IN
UNTIL AT LEAST AFTER THAT.

27:29.600 --> 27:33.388
DO YOU KEEP A LOG
OF WHAT MUSIC IS PLAYED
HERE EACH NIGHT?

27:33.430 --> 27:36.035
WE ARCHIVE PLAYLISTS
GOING BACK TWO YEARS.

27:36.080 --> 27:37.388
HAVE AT IT.

27:40.130 --> 27:42.348
BIG-TIME.
HOW THEY BOUGHT INTO

27:42.390 --> 27:44.824
HIS CORNBALL LINE
OF B.S. I'LL NEVER KNOW.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.563
LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

27:52.800 --> 27:56.918
WE GET STUFF LIKE THIS
EVERY DAY.

27:58.630 --> 28:01.019
"DREAMING OF US
DANCING IN THE DARK."

28:01.070 --> 28:02.719
THIS ONE'S R-RATED,
BUT THERE'S PLENTY

28:02.760 --> 28:05.581
OF TRIPLE-X IN THIS BOX.

28:05.640 --> 28:06.891
ALL OF THE VICTIMS' SONGS
ARE IN HERE.

28:06.940 --> 28:08.248
"STRING OF PEARLS,"
"RUM AND COCA-COLA,'l

28:08.290 --> 28:09.245
"SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES."

28:09.290 --> 28:10.598
VICTIMS?

28:10.640 --> 28:12.073
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

28:12.120 --> 28:13.428
DID CRAIG PLAY
THESE SONGS RANDOMLY,

28:13.470 --> 28:14.903
OR WERE THEY REQUESTS?

28:14.950 --> 28:17.384
REQUESTS. A LOT OF THE SONGS
HE PLAYS ARE REQUESTS.

28:17.430 --> 28:19.250
DID YOU GET ONE
LAST NIGHT?

28:19.300 --> 28:20.904
YEAH. UH...

28:20.960 --> 28:22.951
JANICE. DON'T KNOW
HER LAST NAME,

28:23.000 --> 28:24.126
BUT THIS IS HER NUMBER.

28:24.180 --> 28:25.511
WHAT WAS THE SONG?

28:25.570 --> 28:27.128
"DIAMONDS ARE
A GIRL'S BEST FRIEND."

28:30.010 --> 28:31.523
WHERE'D THAT ROSE
COME FROM?

28:31.570 --> 28:33.709
NO IDEA.

28:39.890 --> 28:42.757
ALVEZ: CRAIG KALINE, FBI!

28:42.800 --> 28:44.358
PRENTISS:
SHOW YOURSELF!

29:01.260 --> 29:03.421
NO SIGN OF JANICE FOX.

29:03.480 --> 29:05.471
WE GOT AN APB OUT.

29:05.520 --> 29:07.476
WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED HERE?

29:07.520 --> 29:10.398
CRAIG FINALLY RAN UP
AGAINST A VICTIM
WHO FOUGHT BACK?

29:10.440 --> 29:12.476
OR JANICE WAS THE KILLER
ALL ALONG.

29:12.530 --> 29:14.782
WE PROFILED REJECT ED LOVER.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.046
A WOMAN SCORNED WOULD
CERTAINLY

29:16.100 --> 29:17.317
FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY.

29:17.360 --> 29:18.964
SHE WANTED CRAIG
ALL TO HERSELF.

29:19.010 --> 29:20.796
SHE TRIED TO ELIMINATE
THE COMPETITION.

29:20.840 --> 29:23.491
JJ SAID THAT HE WAS SUPPOSED
TO RENEW HIS WEDDING VOWS

29:23.540 --> 29:24.928
WITH HIS WIFE CHERYL TODAY.

29:24.980 --> 29:26.493
THAT COULD HAVE
TRIGGERED JANICE.

29:26.540 --> 29:29.623
BUT HE WAS
TORTURED BADLY.

29:29.680 --> 29:32.240
THAT'S AWFULLY VICIOUS
FOR A FEMALE.

29:32.290 --> 29:33.973
DON'T KID YOURSELF.

29:34.030 --> 29:35.725
WHEN NATIVE-AMERICAN
WARRIORS

29:35.770 --> 29:37.761
COULDN'T GET INFORMATION
OUT OF A CAPTURED PRISONER,

29:37.810 --> 29:39.550
THEY'D HAND THEM OVER
TO THEIR WOMEN.

29:39.600 --> 29:41.113
THEY DID?

29:43.820 --> 29:45.868
I SHOULD PUT THAT TIDBIT
ON A PLAQUE

29:45.910 --> 29:48.606
AND HANG IT
OVER MY DESK.

29:50.610 --> 29:52.828
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

29:52.870 --> 29:55.566
I'M SORRY, PORTIA,
BUT IT'S TRUE.

29:55.610 --> 29:57.521
HE FOOLED ME, TOO.

29:57.570 --> 29:59.709
BUT HE'S NOT
LIKE THAT.

29:59.750 --> 30:02.924
WICK WOULD
NEVER HAVE DONE
ANY OF THOSE THINGS.

30:02.970 --> 30:05.757
EVERYBODY THAT MEETS
HIM, THEY LOVE HIM.

30:05.800 --> 30:08.018
SOCIOPATHS ARE DECEPTIVE.

30:08.060 --> 30:11.939
THEY OFTEN HAVE
AN APPEALING PUBLIC FACE.

30:13.200 --> 30:15.714
IS THAT WHY YOU INVITED
HIM TO THE WEDDING,

30:15.770 --> 30:18.022
SO HE COULD
INVESTIGATE WICK?

30:18.070 --> 30:19.799
OF COURSE NOT.

30:19.860 --> 30:21.816
I THINK YOU DID
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
TRUST ME

30:21.860 --> 30:23.851
TO MAKE MY OWN
CHOICES, MOM.

30:23.900 --> 30:26.858
YOUR MOTHER HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS, PORTIA.

30:26.910 --> 30:30.346
IT'S ME. WICK IS
A DANGEROUS MAN.

30:30.390 --> 30:32.995
HE'S BEEN VIOLENT
TOWARDS WOMEN IN HIS PAST.

30:33.040 --> 30:34.917
YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW HIM!

30:34.960 --> 30:37.303
I DON'T HAVE TO
LISTEN TO THIS.

30:37.350 --> 30:38.339
SWEETH EART--

30:38.400 --> 30:40.174
NO, JUST LEAVE
ME ALONE!

30:42.790 --> 30:44.576
GREAT.

30:46.360 --> 30:48.009
SHE'S UPSET.

30:48.060 --> 30:51.666
IT'S NATURAL TO BLAME
THE MESSENGER.

30:51.710 --> 30:55.328
SORT OF LIKE
HOW I'M FEELING
ABOUT YOU RIGHT NOW.

30:55.370 --> 30:56.974
I'M SORRY.

30:57.020 --> 30:59.022
I HAD TO SHARE
WHAT I KNEW.

30:59.070 --> 31:01.891
I'LL TALK TO HER.

31:10.170 --> 31:13.776
IT MUST BE DIFFICULT
BEING YOU,

31:13.820 --> 31:15.344
SEEING THE MONSTERS
OUT THERE

31:15.390 --> 31:16.869
THE REST OF US CAN'T.

31:19.050 --> 31:23.999
EVER WISH THERE WAS
AN OFF SWITCH
TO YOUR SUPER POWERS?

31:25.790 --> 31:28.918
ALL THE TIME.

31:28.970 --> 31:31.188
YEAH.

31:31.230 --> 31:32.879
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

31:35.800 --> 31:37.620
WELL...

31:39.240 --> 31:42.232
GOOD-BYE, DAVID.

31:50.990 --> 31:53.686
OH, THIS IS INTERESTING.

31:56.820 --> 31:58.868
THAT'S THE BRACELET
FROM THE CRIME SCENE.

31:58.910 --> 32:00.730
IT BELONGED TO JANICE.

32:00.780 --> 32:03.089
SAYS IT WAS A GIFT
FROM HER SECRET ADMIRER.

32:04.870 --> 32:05.825
WAIT A MINUTE.

32:05.880 --> 32:08.440
I SEEM TO REMEMBER...

32:08.490 --> 32:10.788
YEAH. THERE.

32:10.840 --> 32:13.183
SIMMONS: THAT'S
THE SAME BRACELET.

32:13.230 --> 32:14.538
YEAH.

32:14.580 --> 32:16.059
CRAIG GAVE IT
TO HIS WIFE

32:16.100 --> 32:18.489
IN HONOR OF THEM
RENEWING THEIR VOWS.

32:18.540 --> 32:20.974
CHERYL WAS UPSET
BECAUSE SHE'D LOST IT.

32:21.020 --> 32:23.363
CRAIG TOOK THE BRACELET
AND GAVE IT TO JANICE.

32:23.410 --> 32:27.198
YEAH. MATT,
LOOK AT WHERE SHE IS.

32:27.240 --> 32:29.629
SHE'S IN A ROSE GARDEN.

32:29.680 --> 32:32.069
AND LOOK
AT WHAT SHE'S USING.

32:44.260 --> 32:45.818
CALM DOWN.

32:45.870 --> 32:47.519
IT'LL ALL BE OVER SOON.

32:54.710 --> 32:55.961
JAREAU: SPENCE LOOKED
THROUGH THE BOX

32:56.010 --> 32:58.228
AT THE RADIO STATION
AND HE FOUND LOVE NOTES

32:58.280 --> 32:59.611
FROM ALL OF THE VICTIMS.

32:59.670 --> 33:01.058
THAT'S HOW CHERYL WAS
DECIDING WHO TO KILL.

33:01.100 --> 33:03.011
SHE DISCOVERED THE BOX.

33:03.060 --> 33:05.324
BUT CRAIG'S ASSISTANT
SAID THAT AMANDA

33:05.370 --> 33:07.759
WAS THE ONLY ONE HE WAS
HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH.

33:07.810 --> 33:10.233
THE OTHERS JUST REQUESTED
SONGS NOW AND THEN.

33:10.290 --> 33:11.587
THAT DIDN'T MATTER.
THE OTHER VICTIMS

33:11.640 --> 33:13.369
MAY HAVE NEVER
EVEN MET CRAIG.

33:13.420 --> 33:15.854
BUT AFTER AMANDA,
CHERYL SAW THEM ALL
AS POTENTIAL THREATS.

33:15.900 --> 33:18.460
SO A HARMLESS FAN NOTE
DROPPED IN THE MAIL
GOT THEM KILLED.

33:18.510 --> 33:20.205
LUCK OF THE DRAW.

33:20.250 --> 33:23.253
JAREAU: OK, SO IF CHERYL
DOES HAVE JANICE,

33:23.300 --> 33:24.688
WHERE DID THEY GO?

33:24.740 --> 33:27.129
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO RENEW
THEIR VOWS TODAY.

33:27.170 --> 33:28.432
MAYBE THAT'S
WHERE THEY WENT.

33:28.480 --> 33:30.038
GARCIA. . .

33:32.480 --> 33:34.266
OHH...HERE IT IS.

33:34.310 --> 33:36.778
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN
CRAIG THAT DAY.

33:36.840 --> 33:38.910
HE WAS SO HANDSOME.

33:38.970 --> 33:40.392
PLEASE DON'T.

33:40.450 --> 33:43.089
YOU KNOW, MOST PEOPLE TAKE
"UNTIL DEATH DO YOU PART"

33:43.150 --> 33:44.276
FOR THEIR VOWS.

33:44.320 --> 33:45.571
WE TOOK THAT PART OUT

33:45.630 --> 33:47.495
BECAUSE NOTHING WAS GOING
TO TAKE US APART,

33:47.540 --> 33:48.620
NOT EVEN DEATH.

33:48.670 --> 33:50.069
I'M SORRY!

33:50.110 --> 33:51.361
BUT THEN IT GOT RUINED.

33:51.420 --> 33:54.321
EVERYTHING,
EVERYONE OUT THERE,

33:54.380 --> 33:55.802
THEY JUST--
THEY JUST COULDN'T--

33:55.850 --> 33:59.115
THEY JUST COULDN'T
LEAVE US ALONE. THEY JUST--

33:59.160 --> 34:03.244
PRENTISS: CHERYL KALINE,
FBI. DROP YOUR WEAPON!

34:03.300 --> 34:05.120
JAREAU:
LOWER YOUR ARMS SLOWLY

34:05.170 --> 34:07.161
AND LEAVE THE GUN
ON THE GROUND.

34:07.210 --> 34:09.644
NO.

34:09.690 --> 34:11.339
I'M GOING TO
JOIN HIM NOW.

34:11.390 --> 34:13.563
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.
THERE'S A BETTER WAY.

34:13.610 --> 34:14.998
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

34:15.050 --> 34:17.439
PRENTISS: WE DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHAT? TELL US.

34:17.490 --> 34:21.312
HIS VOICE, HIS MUSIC
WENT OUT TO EVERYBODY

34:21.360 --> 34:22.440
THROUGH THE AIR.

34:22.490 --> 34:23.707
THERE WAS NO WAY
OF STOPPING IT.

34:23.750 --> 34:25.308
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE?

34:25.360 --> 34:28.238
NO MATTER WHERE I WAS,
NO MATTER WHAT
I WAS DOING,

34:28.280 --> 34:30.145
I FELT THE AIR
AROUND ME,

34:30.190 --> 34:33.148
AND I WONDERED
IF HIS VOICE
WAS THERE,

34:33.200 --> 34:36.237
TALKING TO ANOTHER WOMAN,

34:36.290 --> 34:40.067
LISTENING TO ALL
THE THINGS THAT
SHE WANTED.

34:42.730 --> 34:44.334
CHERYL.

34:44.380 --> 34:46.940
NO.

34:46.990 --> 34:49.072
IF YOU DON'T PUT
THE GUN DOWN...

34:49.130 --> 34:51.030
YOU'RE GONNA MISS IT.

34:51.080 --> 34:52.729
MISS WHAT?

34:52.780 --> 34:55.431
CRAIG'S FINAL SHOW.

34:55.480 --> 34:58.859
HE RECORDED IT LAST WEEK.

34:58.920 --> 35:02.788
DEDICATED EVERY SONG
TO YOU.

35:02.830 --> 35:05.048
TO ONLY YOU.

35:07.360 --> 35:09.089
WELL, CAN I HEAR IT?

35:09.150 --> 35:11.095
IT'S PLAYING RIGHT NOW.

35:12.670 --> 35:14.183
IT'S IN THE AIR,

35:14.240 --> 35:17.801
ALL AROUND US.

35:17.850 --> 35:20.580
YEAH.

35:20.640 --> 35:23.370
OH! YEAH, I CAN HEAR IT.

35:23.420 --> 35:26.719
OH! IT'S REALLY HIM.

35:26.770 --> 35:30.206
I CAN HEAR IT. OH...

35:30.250 --> 35:31.205
OK. OK.

35:31.250 --> 35:32.774
OHH...

35:32.820 --> 35:36.688
OH...OHH.

36:04.850 --> 36:06.408
WOW.

36:06.460 --> 36:08.849
I HOPE I WASN'T
INTERRUPTING ANYTHING,
AGENT ROSSI,

36:08.900 --> 36:11.289
BUT I WANTED YOU TO
HEAR IT DIRECTLY
FROM ME.

36:11.340 --> 36:15.253
PORTIA AND I ARE
GOING FORWARD
WITH THE WEDDING.

36:15.300 --> 36:17.029
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HER?

36:17.080 --> 36:18.991
I'M NOT THAT GUY
ANYMORE.

36:19.040 --> 36:21.770
THE STRENGTH
OF OUR LOVE
CHANGED ME.

36:21.830 --> 36:23.309
DOES HER MOTHER KNOW?

36:23.350 --> 36:26.524
YEAH. PORTIA'S TELLING
HER RIGHT NOW.

36:26.570 --> 36:28.128
ANYHOW, THAT WAS IT.

36:28.180 --> 36:31.786
JUST CAME TO SEE THAT
LOOK OF DISAPPOINTMENT
ON YOUR FACE.

36:31.840 --> 36:33.967
NO HARD FEELINGS,
BUT, UH,

36:34.010 --> 36:35.966
YOU'RE NOT INVITED
ANYMORE.

36:37.230 --> 36:38.834
AAH! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

36:38.890 --> 36:41.233
THE THING IS, WICK,
I DO HAVE HARD FEELINGS.

36:41.280 --> 36:42.406
YOU HAVE A HISTORY
OF HITTING WOMEN.

36:42.460 --> 36:43.939
NOBODY CAN PROVE IT--AAH!

36:43.980 --> 36:45.322
YOU'LL MARRY PORTIA,
YOU'LL HIT HER,

36:45.370 --> 36:47.588
THEN YOU'LL
AGREE TO GO AWAY
FOR A NEGOTIATED PRICE.

36:47.640 --> 36:49.153
IS THAT ABOUT RIGHT?

36:49.200 --> 36:50.280
SERIOUSLY, YOU'RE GONNA
BREAK MY FRIGGIN' WRIST.

36:50.330 --> 36:52.025
OH, NO, THIS IS JUST
SOFT TISSUE PAIN.

36:52.070 --> 36:55.028
HOWEVER, IF YOU WANT
TO AVOID REAL FACIAL
RECONSTRUCTION,

36:55.080 --> 36:57.594
I SUGGEST YOU TAKE
ANOTHER SIT-DOWN WITH PORTIA

36:57.650 --> 36:59.777
AND YOU EXPLAIN TO HER
YOU THINK SHE'S TOO GOOD
FOR YOU,

36:59.820 --> 37:01.811
AND THEN YOU HIT THE ROAD
PERMANENTLY.

37:01.870 --> 37:04.509
IF YOU WEREN'T FBI--AAH!
UGH! UNH!

37:04.570 --> 37:06.959
I CAN'T MAKE IT OUT
ABOVE ALL YOUR WHIMPERING.

37:09.400 --> 37:11.300
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

37:11.350 --> 37:13.910
YOU DON'T SCARE ME.

37:13.970 --> 37:15.653
WHY SHOULD I SCARE YOU?

37:15.710 --> 37:18.793
MY JOB IS TO STOP
SCARY PEOPLE.

37:18.840 --> 37:23.925
FOR INSTANCE, A GUY
WHO TAKES A PLIERS TO PEOPLE

37:23.980 --> 37:25.186
HE DOESN'T LIKE.

37:25.240 --> 37:27.060
NOW, LET'S SAY
THAT THIS GUY

37:27.110 --> 37:30.546
IS UP FOR PAROLE, SAY,
NEXT THURSDAY

37:30.590 --> 37:32.239
AT ANGOLA PRISON.

37:32.290 --> 37:35.020
AND LET'S JUST SAY
THAT I NEGLECT TO SHOW UP

37:35.070 --> 37:36.856
TO TESTIFY AGAINST
HIS RELEASE.

37:36.900 --> 37:40.336
NOW, THAT GUY, HE MIGHT
MISINTERPRET THINGS.

37:40.380 --> 37:42.723
HE MIGHT THINK
I DID HIM A FAVOR,

37:42.780 --> 37:45.032
THAT HE OWES ME ONE.

37:45.080 --> 37:46.957
AND THEN...

37:47.000 --> 37:52.085
HE MIGHT LOOK FOR A WAY
TO PAY THAT DEBT.

37:58.580 --> 38:00.525
YOU KNOW WHAT?

38:00.580 --> 38:02.354
TO HELL WITH PORTIA.

38:02.410 --> 38:05.664
SHE AIN'T ANYTHING
SPECIAL ANWVAY.

38:16.680 --> 38:19.592
I WONDER WHY SOME MEN
ARE LIKE CRAIG KALINE.

38:19.640 --> 38:21.505
WHAT, HORN DOGS,
YOU MEAN?

38:21.560 --> 38:23.460
IS THAT THE MEDICAL TERM?

38:23.510 --> 38:24.727
LEWIS, LAUGHING:
I BELIEVE IT IS.

38:24.780 --> 38:26.429
SERIOUSLY, THOUGH, CHERYL--

38:26.470 --> 38:27.903
BEFORE SHE WENT OFF
THE DEEP END--

38:27.950 --> 38:29.941
WAS A DEVOTED
AND LOVING WIFE.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.649
WHY DID CRAIG FEEL
LIKE HE HAD TO BED

38:31.700 --> 38:32.951
EVERYTHING THAT MOVED?

38:33.000 --> 38:34.558
REID: YOU KNOW,
IT MIGHT SOUND CRAZY,

38:34.610 --> 38:36.214
BUT HAVING MULTIPLE
SEXUAL PARTNERS

38:36.270 --> 38:37.305
ACTUALLY ISN'T HARD
TO UNDERSTAND

38:37.350 --> 38:38.908
FROM AN
ANTHROPOLOGICAL SENSE.

38:38.960 --> 38:41.576
OVER 90% OF MAMMALS
ARE PROMISCUOUS.

38:41.620 --> 38:43.269
IT SERVES THE FUNCTION
FOR SELF-PRESERVATION

38:43.320 --> 38:45.788
AS WELL AS A COPING
MECHANISM TO HELP
RELIEVE STRESS.

38:45.840 --> 38:48.832
CHEATING ON YOUR SPOUSE
RELIEVES STRESS?

38:48.890 --> 38:52.269
I THINK THE ANIMAL KINGDOM
GOT THAT ONE BACKWARDS.

38:52.330 --> 38:55.106
WELL, I WONDER HOW ROSSI
AND KRYSTALL ARE DOING.

38:55.150 --> 38:56.708
SEEING AN OLD FLAME
AFTER THAT MANY YEARS,

38:56.760 --> 38:59.149
CHANCES ARE IT GOT
REAL AWKWARD REAL FAST.

38:59.200 --> 39:01.065
NO. NO, NOT ROSSI.

39:01.120 --> 39:03.372
WITH THAT GUY
AS YOUR D.C. TOUR GUIDE,

39:03.420 --> 39:05.593
PROBABLY PAINTING THE TOWN
FIRE ENGINE RED.

39:25.230 --> 39:27.744
I'LL HAVE SOME OF WHAT
YOU'RE DRINKING.

39:31.150 --> 39:33.368
NEAT, RIGHT?

39:33.410 --> 39:37.938
WOULD YOU MIND PUTTING
SOME HAPPIER MUSIC ON?

39:37.980 --> 39:43.100
I AM TRYING TO PRETEND
THINGS HAVEN'T
FALLEN APART COMPLETELY.

39:46.030 --> 39:48.988
SOLITAI RE, DAVID

39:49.030 --> 39:52.329
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO
LEAN INTO THE OBVIOUS.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.642
YOU CAN PLAY THIS
ON YOUR SMARTPHONE,
YOU KNOW.

39:54.690 --> 39:57.818
NO. I LIKE THE FEEL
OF CARDS,

39:57.870 --> 40:02.603
THE SMELL, THE SOUND
THEY MAKE WHEN YOU SHUFFLE.

40:04.570 --> 40:06.356
BETTER?

40:06.400 --> 40:08.174
PERFECT.

40:08.230 --> 40:14.009
MAN: BOY, HAVE YOU EVER
GOT IT MADE...

40:14.060 --> 40:18.884
SO, ANYHOW, THAT'S IT.

40:18.930 --> 40:22.013
THE WEDDING WAS...

40:22.070 --> 40:23.549
OVER.

40:23.590 --> 40:25.546
THEN IT WAS ON AGAIN.

40:25.590 --> 40:28.377
THEN IT WAS
OVER AGAIN.

40:28.420 --> 40:30.024
HEH.

40:30.070 --> 40:33.597
WICK HIGHTAILED IT.

40:33.640 --> 40:36.859
SOMETHING CHANGED
HIS MIND.

40:36.910 --> 40:39.902
I WONDER WHAT.

40:39.950 --> 40:41.827
YOU REALLY
GOT IT MADE

40:41.870 --> 40:44.509
HOW'S PORTIA
HOLDING UP?

40:44.570 --> 40:46.390
SHE'S OK.

40:46.440 --> 40:51.480
MY DAUGHTER DOESN'T ALWAYS
SHOW THE BEST JUDGMENT,
YOU KNOW?

40:51.530 --> 40:54.488
KIND OF LIKE
HER MOM IN THAT WAY.

40:54.530 --> 40:57.146
BUT SHE'S STRONG.

40:57.190 --> 40:59.704
ALSO LIKE HER MOM.

40:59.760 --> 41:07.678
OH, BOY, HAVE YOU EVER
GOT IT MADE...

41:07.720 --> 41:11.542
I'M HEADING BACK
TOMORROW.

41:11.590 --> 41:14.718
DON'T LET THEM
MAKE THAT MISTAKE...

41:14.770 --> 41:16.681
FEEL LIKE SOME POKER?

41:16.730 --> 41:18.243
I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE POKER.

41:18.300 --> 41:20.109
I'LL DEAL.

41:20.170 --> 41:24.083
AHH. THERE IT IS.

41:24.130 --> 41:26.644
THAT OLD SOUND...

41:26.700 --> 41:29.430
THAT TROUBLE'S
AROUND THE CORNER.

41:29.480 --> 41:31.436
SO WHAT'S THE ANTE?

41:31.480 --> 41:33.357
THAT'S UP TO YOU, DAVID.

41:33.400 --> 41:35.652
HOUSE RULES.

41:35.710 --> 41:38.747
WELL, HOW ABOUT
A MINT COPY

41:38.800 --> 41:44.796
OF JOHNNY MATHIS'
GREATEST HITS ON VINYL?

41:46.630 --> 41:49.098
YOU HAVE THAT?

41:49.150 --> 41:52.108
IT'S NEXT UP
ON THE TURNTABLE.

41:52.160 --> 41:57.678
JOHNNY MATHIS:
I'LL BE EASY TO FIND

41:57.730 --> 42:02.463
WHEN LOVE COMES
LOOKING FOR ME...

42:02.520 --> 42:04.078

HOW FAR WE TRAVEL,

42:04.130 --> 42:07.429
THE MEMORIES WILL FOLLOW
IN THE BAGGAGE CAR."

42:07.480 --> 42:09.641
AUGUST STRINDBERG.

42:09.700 --> 42:15.957
MATHIS: ...SO THAT
I'LL BE EASY TO SEE

42:16.010 --> 42:18.092
NO HIDE...

42:22.750 --> 42:24.149
