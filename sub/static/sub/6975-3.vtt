01:28.700 --> 01:33.500
Land sakes, George,
what are you trying to do?

01:37.400 --> 01:39.500
I was trying to be quiet.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.000
Quiet?

01:41.000 --> 01:44.300
I smelled you on the stairs.

01:44.400 --> 01:46.500
39 years, I'm still
surprised that...

01:46.500 --> 01:49.600
...embalming fluid of yours
doesn't wake the dead.

01:49.600 --> 01:53.800
Didn't wake old Zeke McPherson
tonight, God rest his soul.

01:54.500 --> 01:57.100
You go outside and take those
clothes of yours off...

01:57.100 --> 02:00.700
...so I can rest mine.

02:00.700 --> 02:02.500
George!

02:02.500 --> 02:06.500
I'm going, Tahoma,
I'm going.

02:19.800 --> 02:24.100
What the hell?
What the hell is that?

02:45.000 --> 02:46.500
George?

04:17.800 --> 04:20.300
<i>So, this is where the bad
kids are banished to.</i>

04:20.300 --> 04:24.400
<i>Put me down here I'd probably cook up
a lot of crazy ideas, too.</i>

04:27.700 --> 04:29.300
Good morning.

04:29.300 --> 04:31.100
Morning.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.800
I'll catch you guys later.

04:39.700 --> 04:42.700
Some friends...
they're just curious.

04:43.300 --> 04:45.400
I'm not here to be a curiosity,
Agent Doggett.

04:45.400 --> 04:47.100
I'm here to work.

04:47.100 --> 04:49.300
I am, too, Agent Scully.

04:49.300 --> 04:52.800
I've been here all weekend
and early this morning...

04:52.800 --> 04:55.600
...went over every X-File
in the cabinet there.

04:55.600 --> 04:58.100
Just left to get
some coffee.

04:58.100 --> 05:00.100
Well...

05:00.400 --> 05:02.100
Do you have any questions?

05:02.100 --> 05:04.900
Just a few.

05:04.900 --> 05:08.500
Maybe first you could tell me where
your area is here and...

05:08.500 --> 05:10.700
...where mine's going to be.

05:11.400 --> 05:14.100
This is my partner's office,
Agent Doggett.

05:14.100 --> 05:17.600
You and I will just be
using it for a while.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.400
- So, where do we get started?
- Homicides: Two... in Idaho.

05:26.400 --> 05:30.100
White male, 62,
undertaker by profession, ...

05:30.100 --> 05:34.600
...he was killed on his front
porch about ten feet away from his wife.

05:35.500 --> 05:37.300
Holy god.

05:37.300 --> 05:41.000
Cause of death was blood loss
from numerous deep wounds...

05:41.000 --> 05:43.300
...from bites.

05:43.300 --> 05:46.300
Any thoughts, any questions?

05:51.700 --> 05:55.200
- "Bites"?
- On his head torso and hands.

05:55.200 --> 05:58.200
Two of his fingers are
missing... eaten off.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.500
By what, an animal?

06:00.500 --> 06:02.100
These were murders.

06:02.100 --> 06:06.700
The, uh, bites on his wife
appear to be human.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.000
I've seen some violent crimes, ...

06:09.000 --> 06:12.300
I mean, some seriously
screwed up stuff, but, uh...

06:12.300 --> 06:15.200
...this is extreme.

06:16.300 --> 06:18.700
Is there demonstration
of motive?

06:18.700 --> 06:21.100
Not according to local P.D.

06:21.100 --> 06:25.600
Is there any pattern, uh...
ritual or anything?

06:26.700 --> 06:31.200
I have to admit, Agent Scully,
I'm at a loss.

06:31.200 --> 06:35.000
Well, that's a good place to start.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.700
- You the folks from the FBI?
- Yeah.

06:52.700 --> 06:55.100
Yale Abbott,
Cassia County Sheriff's.

06:55.100 --> 06:58.200
Hi. Agent Scully.
This is Agent Doggett.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.400
We like to think we can handle
our own problems around here...

07:00.400 --> 07:03.900
...but a couple hotshots up in the county
seat seem to think this is beyond us.

07:03.900 --> 07:07.400
Not that we don't appreciate your coming out
all this way to give us a hand.

07:07.400 --> 07:09.400
Well, I hope we can.

07:09.400 --> 07:12.300
I have to admit I'm a little
baffled by what I've seen.

07:12.300 --> 07:13.400
Oh, really?

07:13.400 --> 07:15.200
Understand, Detective,
that we've seen...

07:15.200 --> 07:17.500
...cases like yours
regularly on our unit.

07:17.500 --> 07:20.900
Agent Doggett has only
just been assigned to the X-Files.

07:20.900 --> 07:24.400
I can assure you that there's nothing
baffling about human bite marks.

07:24.400 --> 07:27.100
Well, that's just what I was
getting around to, ma'am.

07:27.100 --> 07:30.700
We're not so sure now that
these bites are human.

07:33.500 --> 07:36.000
The bodies were
discovered by neighbors, ...

07:36.000 --> 07:39.500
...so there was contamination
of the general crime scene.

07:39.500 --> 07:42.000
My boys did a real
damn good job of...

07:42.000 --> 07:45.600
...separating the various shoe
prints and pulling these.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.300
Come on over.

07:48.900 --> 07:51.200
Right there, see that?

07:51.200 --> 07:52.900
What is it?

07:52.900 --> 07:56.600
- It's not human, I know that.
- It's not quite animal, either.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.600
There's only four toes.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.700
That's not an unheard
of birth defect.

08:00.700 --> 08:04.300
Uh, no more rare than
polydactylism.

08:04.300 --> 08:06.000
What did she just say?

08:06.000 --> 08:09.500
I assume she means
it could be human.

08:11.100 --> 08:13.800
Is that a fair assumption?

08:15.400 --> 08:18.100
I say that assumption
is the problem here.

08:18.100 --> 08:20.200
A strange print is found...

08:20.200 --> 08:23.300
...and immediately the most
important piece of evidence...

08:23.300 --> 08:26.400
...is just thrown out to try
and force an explanation.

08:26.400 --> 08:30.300
Maybe this print can help
explain those bite marks.

08:30.300 --> 08:33.600
- How?
- I'm not quite sure yet.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.500
She's not quite sure yet.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.799
Well, I have to say I've worked
a lot of homicides...

08:39.799 --> 08:42.500
...but if the victims laid out
here for any time at all...

08:42.500 --> 08:44.600
...in a setting like this, ...

08:44.600 --> 08:48.600
...it'd be pretty remarkable
if they didn't attract animals.

08:50.700 --> 08:54.900
I think that postmortem predation
is definitely a consideration here, ...

08:54.900 --> 08:57.900
...but I only see one print...

08:57.900 --> 09:00.900
...and if it were an animal there
would be numerous prints...

09:00.900 --> 09:05.000
...all over here and
in the yard.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.900
You agree, Agent Doggett?

09:14.300 --> 09:17.200
I'm going to go take
a look around.

09:23.700 --> 09:27.000
You know, I got two
old folks in the morgue...

09:27.000 --> 09:28.800
...mauled beyond recognition.

09:28.800 --> 09:31.900
I have no motive to go on,
no intent.

09:31.900 --> 09:35.700
There's not one shred of evidence
that cries out for a human explanation, ...

09:35.700 --> 09:37.700
...yet you stand there telling me
flat out...

09:37.700 --> 09:41.000
...that what we're looking for
is a man.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
Thanks for everything, Agent Scully.
We'll take it from here.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.400
I'm sure your explanation
will mollify all those...

09:49.400 --> 09:52.100
...hotshots down at the
county seat, Detective.

09:52.100 --> 09:56.100
And relieve any general anxiety about
what this thing might be...

09:56.100 --> 09:59.400
...but only until it strikes again.

09:59.400 --> 10:02.200
And one more thing:

10:02.200 --> 10:06.300
I never said that what you're
looking for is a man.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Agent Scully.

10:20.300 --> 10:22.500
Is that a second print?

10:29.000 --> 10:32.500
It could be but I'm not sure
if it tells us anything.

10:32.500 --> 10:34.500
Well, maybe there's no prints
in the yard because...

10:34.500 --> 10:37.000
...whatever made these didn't go
through the yard.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.500
It came through the house.

10:39.500 --> 10:43.400
Well, if anything, I'd say this
print leads up the stairs.

10:56.400 --> 10:59.700
Think I've got another
partial here.

11:06.400 --> 11:09.600
You know, there is a more
obvious explanation.

11:09.700 --> 11:11.800
The more basic answer...

11:11.800 --> 11:14.200
...is what we're dealing with
here is simply a man.

11:14.200 --> 11:18.100
A psychotic killer with a deformed foot.

11:18.100 --> 11:21.200
You're familiar with the
principle of Occam's Razor?

11:21.200 --> 11:23.000
Yeah. You take every
possible explanation...

11:23.000 --> 11:25.300
...and you choose the
simplest one.

11:25.300 --> 11:30.800
Agent Mulder used to refer to it as
"Occam's Principle of Limited Imagination."

11:30.800 --> 11:34.200
Unless you have a simple
explanation as to how a killer...

11:34.200 --> 11:38.800
...with a deformed foot
leaves a print only every 25 feet.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.500
No.

11:43.500 --> 11:46.500
Or to what he'd even be doing
up here.

11:46.500 --> 11:50.200
I don't know. I'm trying to
figure it out just like you are.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.500
Agent Doggett.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.700
Dark up here.

12:41.300 --> 12:44.100
What do you see?
Agent Scully?

12:44.100 --> 12:47.100
Right now, not a heck of a lot.

12:58.500 --> 13:02.300
If there was anything up here
it might have gone out that window.

13:05.500 --> 13:08.500
You ever carry one of these?

13:10.300 --> 13:12.300
Never.

13:24.300 --> 13:26.700
"V" for victory.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.100
What?

13:30.100 --> 13:33.800
You said the male victim was
missing two fingers?

13:33.800 --> 13:36.400
Well, how did the fingers
get up here?

13:39.500 --> 13:43.300
Well, from their smell,
I'd say they were regurgitated.

13:43.700 --> 13:45.300
Recently.

13:45.300 --> 13:47.400
By what?

13:51.300 --> 13:54.500
I saw those on the porch, too.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.600
Looks like, to me...
I don't know.

13:57.600 --> 14:01.200
Like it was... it was...

14:02.300 --> 14:04.700
Hanging there?

14:54.200 --> 14:56.200
- You're still here.
- Yeah.

14:56.200 --> 14:59.500
Well, I was waiting for some
lab results and then I...

14:59.500 --> 15:01.400
...wanted to take another
look at the body.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.700
Why? What did you find?

15:02.700 --> 15:05.200
Nothing that will allay anyone's
fears about...

15:05.200 --> 15:07.500
...what killed this
man or his wife.

15:07.500 --> 15:11.200
"What"?
You mean "who" killed them.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.500
Well, to be honest,
what I found here...

15:13.500 --> 15:16.500
...leans more towards
an animal explanation.

15:16.500 --> 15:21.100
The, uh, scratches on the body match
the four-toed prints that we found.

15:21.100 --> 15:24.500
And the bites have
fang-like tears.

15:24.500 --> 15:29.200
What I thought were marks left by
human molars are now inconclusive...

15:29.200 --> 15:31.600
...because of enzymes that were found
in the bites which are...

15:31.600 --> 15:37.000
...clearly inhuman-
anticoagulents which...

15:37.000 --> 15:42.300
...are found solely in the
saliva of bats.

15:43.200 --> 15:45.500
Bats.

15:45.500 --> 15:47.900
I can't exactly explain it
but I...

15:47.900 --> 15:50.200
...realize that I owe the
Detective an apology.

15:50.200 --> 15:53.500
Well, I'm not so sure about that.

15:54.900 --> 15:58.700
Montana headline circa 1956.

15:58.700 --> 16:01.200
The story's the same as
what you told me.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.700
"The creature was taken to
the county coroner...

16:02.700 --> 16:06.100
...who confirmed it was
neither man nor animal."

16:06.100 --> 16:08.200
Two days later,
the county coroner was disemboweled...

16:08.200 --> 16:11.800
...by something with sharp
teeth and four-toed claws.

16:11.800 --> 16:15.600
Something that ate several body parts
and regurgitated them elsewhere.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.200
Did they ever find it?

16:17.200 --> 16:19.600
Five men died or disappeared...

16:19.600 --> 16:23.200
...and then the killing stops.
Doesn't say why.

16:23.200 --> 16:28.900
But 44 years later it appears
that it's back and killing again.

16:56.100 --> 16:58.900
You see those marks, right?

16:58.900 --> 17:02.100
And the ones over here
on the rafter?

17:08.800 --> 17:12.599
If you ask me,
those look like claw marks.

17:14.300 --> 17:17.099
I don't care what kind of
a savage he is, ...

17:17.099 --> 17:20.400
...what did this isn't human.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.700
Well, if I may speak for
Agent Scully, ...

17:23.700 --> 17:26.900
...I think we're both prepared
to concede that point, Detective.

17:26.900 --> 17:29.200
Then you know what
this thing is?

17:29.200 --> 17:32.000
I've got a newspaper
article I want to show you.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.900
<i>- Agent Doggett...
- A rather strange account from 1956...</i>

17:35.900 --> 17:37.500
I found something.

17:37.500 --> 17:40.700
A photo album. I think it's
our first break on this case.

17:40.700 --> 17:41.500
What is it?

17:41.500 --> 17:44.100
The victim's daughter-- Ariel--
her dead body was pulled...

17:44.100 --> 17:47.200
- ...from the river here last week.
- I got that call.

17:47.200 --> 17:50.800
Had to come tell
Mrs. McKesson the bad news.

17:50.800 --> 17:53.000
You trying to say there's
some kind of connection?

17:53.000 --> 17:56.200
Well, you not only told her mother that
her 62-year-old daughter was dead...

17:56.200 --> 17:59.900
...but that her body had been horribly
and inexplicably burned.

17:59.900 --> 18:03.400
A daughter who, by the way,
she hadn't even seen in over 40 years.

18:03.400 --> 18:06.400
Since 1956, to be exact--
which is the date your...

18:06.400 --> 18:10.100
...article says those first
killings started.

18:10.500 --> 18:13.200
Do you see the connection?

18:14.200 --> 18:17.900
I'm not, uh... sure where you're
going with this, Agent Scully.

18:17.900 --> 18:22.000
- The daughter is the connection.
- How is that?

18:22.000 --> 18:25.300
I don't know exactly but these
killings only started up...

18:25.300 --> 18:28.100
...since her burned body
has been found.

18:28.100 --> 18:31.200
Honest to god. You just jump
at whatever explanation...

18:31.200 --> 18:33.900
...is the wildest and most
far-fetched, don't you?

18:33.900 --> 18:36.400
Well, I suggest that
you jump at it, too...

18:36.400 --> 18:38.300
...because her body may have been
burned for a reason...

18:38.300 --> 18:41.300
...and you're going to want to
exhume it in order to find out why.

18:41.300 --> 18:43.000
You want me to dig up
a dead body...

18:43.000 --> 18:47.900
...when I have real people out there
whose lives are in real danger?

19:07.600 --> 19:09.600
What did you say to him?

19:09.600 --> 19:13.300
Well, I told him to dig up the body.
Isn't that what you wanted?

19:13.300 --> 19:16.100
What else did you say to him?

19:17.700 --> 19:19.900
Well, I told him that
you were... um... a...

19:19.900 --> 19:22.800
...leading authority on
paranormal phenomena and...

19:22.800 --> 19:24.600
...who are we to argue
with an expert.

19:24.600 --> 19:27.800
Look, I am not an expert.

19:27.800 --> 19:31.000
I am a scientist who happens
to have seen a lot.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.400
I am just making a leap here.

19:34.800 --> 19:37.700
Well, I am sure you have
your reasons.

19:37.700 --> 19:40.700
Look, so, so, what,
you told him to exhume the body...

19:40.700 --> 19:44.300
...when you don't even
necessarily believe me yourself?

19:47.200 --> 19:48.900
I told you I spent the weekend...

19:48.900 --> 19:50.800
...looking through that cabinet
full of X-Files...

19:50.800 --> 19:54.800
...and I saw how pretty much every
X-File broke-- with a leap.

19:54.800 --> 19:59.000
Now, maybe I'm just an old-fashioned cop
but I don't take leaps.

19:59.000 --> 20:04.700
In my experience leaps only
get people killed.

20:05.400 --> 20:10.800
Well, I'd say that you're taking a
pretty big leap believing in that article...

20:11.800 --> 20:15.000
...about a human bat.

21:47.800 --> 21:49.600
I don't know how you do it.

21:49.600 --> 21:52.400
Called the judge's order in
a half ago. You guys are fast.

21:52.400 --> 21:57.500
Yep, we're really fast when
someone's done most of our work.

21:57.500 --> 22:00.000
What are you talking about?

22:01.500 --> 22:05.600
We got out here, somebody had
already dug up the box.

22:05.600 --> 22:08.000
All we had to do was
haul it out.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
I don't know what they
were using...

22:10.000 --> 22:14.500
...but they scratched up the wood
on the lid real good. See?

22:18.600 --> 22:22.300
Let's get this down to the morgue.
I think the sooner, the better.

22:48.400 --> 22:49.900
God!

23:45.700 --> 23:48.500
I want a word with you.

24:00.300 --> 24:03.500
Look, we listened to you.
The Detective listened to you.

24:03.500 --> 24:06.100
We could have been out hunting
this thing down, Agent Doggett.

24:06.100 --> 24:09.400
- You should be doing that now.
- Now?

24:09.400 --> 24:12.500
Now's too late for
the Detective, isn't it?

24:12.500 --> 24:16.400
Look, we don't need you telling us
what to do or your partner.

24:16.400 --> 24:18.500
She's the one responsible
for this.

24:18.500 --> 24:21.700
Nobody's responsible for this
except for whatever did it.

24:21.700 --> 24:24.000
Look, I don't care who she is
or what she is, ...

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
...she's not touching that body.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.800
We don't need her
far-out theories.

24:28.800 --> 24:32.200
She's not welcome here.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.500
What happened to the lynch mob?

24:45.500 --> 24:47.200
You hear all that?

24:47.200 --> 24:49.100
I heard enough.

24:49.100 --> 24:51.800
Things have taken a little turn.

24:51.800 --> 24:53.400
I don't think so, Agent Doggett.

24:53.400 --> 24:56.900
Well, you can think what you want
but I think this looks bad for the FBI.

24:56.900 --> 25:00.500
- It was unavoidable.
- How do you figure that?

25:01.700 --> 25:05.000
This is the body pulled
from the river.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.600
She died of natural causes--
congestive heart failure--

25:08.600 --> 25:11.000
...but her body was only
burned afterwards.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.900
- By who, and why burn it?
- Well, obviously to cover something up.

25:14.900 --> 25:17.800
- Yeah, but what?
- That's what I still don't know.

25:17.800 --> 25:20.800
Look, we know what we're
looking for.

25:20.800 --> 25:22.900
We should be out there
looking for it.

25:22.900 --> 25:24.900
We're not going to catch it
standing here speculating.

25:24.900 --> 25:27.900
Look, it kills like an animal,
but with purpose.

25:27.900 --> 25:29.900
It stalked the detective for
the same reason...

25:29.900 --> 25:32.400
...that it stalked the old woman
and the undertaker.

25:32.400 --> 25:36.000
Each of those victims had had
contact with this burnt body.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.600
The undertaker prepared it.

25:38.600 --> 25:42.500
Her mother ID'd it and the
Detective got the call when she was found.

25:42.500 --> 25:45.100
Well, who else would have
had contact with it?

25:45.100 --> 25:47.700
The, uh, man who found
her in the river.

25:47.700 --> 25:50.600
A, uh, Myron Stefaniuk.

25:50.600 --> 25:52.500
- Stefaniuk?
- Yeah.

25:52.500 --> 25:58.200
One of the hunters in the photo in
1956 was Ernie Stefaniuk.

26:02.700 --> 26:06.900
There's an address in his file.
I hope we're not too late.

26:33.700 --> 26:35.500
Mr. Stefaniuk?

26:35.500 --> 26:37.400
Myron Stefaniuk?

26:37.700 --> 26:40.700
- That's me.
- Good. Sorry.

26:40.700 --> 26:42.400
You gave us a bit of a scare.

26:42.400 --> 26:44.800
We went to your home up the
road and we couldn't find you.

26:44.800 --> 26:47.000
Why would that scare you?

26:47.000 --> 26:49.800
Well, sir, we work with the FBI
and we have reason to believe...

26:49.800 --> 26:53.000
- ...that your life may be in danger.
- I'm in danger?

26:53.000 --> 26:54.700
Well, we're investigating
some murders, sir, ...

26:54.700 --> 26:58.500
...that we believe may be connected to the
burnt body that you found recently.

26:58.500 --> 27:00.100
I fished it out of the river.

27:00.100 --> 27:03.700
- What have I got to do with anything?
- Well, we're not saying for sure that you do.

27:03.700 --> 27:06.900
It may just be your
connection to the body.

27:06.900 --> 27:10.500
There is no connection.
I just fished it out of the river.

27:10.500 --> 27:15.600
- Well, sorry, sir, but that may be enough.
- It's nonsense. Leave me alone.

27:15.900 --> 27:18.300
Ernie Stefaniuk.

27:18.300 --> 27:22.900
Lived in Montana in 1956.
Do you know him?

27:23.500 --> 27:25.900
Ernie was my brother.

27:25.900 --> 27:29.300
He was one of three hunters that
killed a man that was half animal.

27:29.300 --> 27:31.200
Please!
That was a long time ago.

27:31.200 --> 27:34.800
Do you know where we can find him
to talk with him, sir?

27:34.800 --> 27:37.900
My brother's dead.
That thing killed him.

27:37.900 --> 27:41.300
Well, I have a newspaper story that
says your brother disappeared.

27:41.300 --> 27:44.200
That was 40 years ago.

27:44.200 --> 27:48.100
Leave it alone!
Leave me alone!

28:23.200 --> 28:26.000
You know, we've been
out here for nine hours.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.600
The only thing this man seems to be
in danger of is terminal loneliness.

28:32.800 --> 28:35.300
Maybe I'm wrong.

28:35.300 --> 28:38.300
Maybe this is all just a...

28:38.300 --> 28:41.700
...a grand coincidence and we're
wasting our time out here.

28:41.700 --> 28:43.800
You were so sure before.

28:43.800 --> 28:49.300
Yeah, I was sure of the facts as
I had deduced them scientifically.

28:52.000 --> 28:56.300
Maybe I'm... I'm trying
to force them into shape.

28:56.300 --> 28:59.500
Maybe I'm manufacturing a theory.

28:59.500 --> 29:02.500
Well, what happened to
taking a leap?

29:02.800 --> 29:06.400
Maybe I'm just trying
too hard.

29:06.400 --> 29:08.600
To do what?

29:08.600 --> 29:10.900
To be Mulder?

29:15.200 --> 29:17.800
You know,
I'm not Oxford educated.

29:17.800 --> 29:20.100
About all I know about
the paranormal is...

29:20.100 --> 29:24.300
...men are from Mars and
women are from Venus.

29:25.300 --> 29:29.000
But I don't think you're
wrong, Agent Scully.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.800
What makes you say that?

29:30.800 --> 29:32.700
Well, I'm no Fox Mulder, ...

29:32.700 --> 29:36.100
...but I can tell when a
man's hiding something.

29:36.100 --> 29:38.300
Myron Stefaniuk fishes a woman
out of the river...

29:38.300 --> 29:40.700
...who's been gone for 40 years.

29:40.700 --> 29:43.900
He has a brother he hasn't
seen in over 40 years.

29:43.900 --> 29:46.900
A brother who just happened to hunt
down some kind of creature...

29:46.900 --> 29:49.000
...over 40 years ago.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.300
Well, what does he have to hide?

29:51.300 --> 29:56.300
Well, that's what I'm hoping this
good cop work is going to show us.

31:33.300 --> 31:35.400
You there!

31:35.400 --> 31:37.600
Stop right there!

31:44.200 --> 31:45.700
I see him.

31:51.800 --> 31:53.900
Stop where you are!

31:54.100 --> 31:56.700
Put your hands up and out!

31:57.900 --> 32:00.600
Now, turn around, slowly.

32:02.300 --> 32:04.900
Are you Ernie Stefaniuk?

32:05.200 --> 32:07.200
Are you Ernie Stefaniuk?!

32:07.200 --> 32:08.700
Yeah.

32:21.800 --> 32:25.200
How's a man supposed to live...

32:25.900 --> 32:29.500
...when his fear becomes obsession?

32:29.500 --> 32:32.400
You'd do the same thing.

32:32.400 --> 32:34.900
Who wouldn't who wanted to live?

32:34.900 --> 32:37.300
You never left the island?

32:38.600 --> 32:44.900
44 years-- I wouldn't dare
knowing it was out there.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.300
That it could come back for me.

32:48.900 --> 32:51.300
You know something about it?

32:51.300 --> 32:54.600
About what this thing is?

32:57.400 --> 33:01.000
I know on the evolutionary ladder...

33:01.000 --> 33:05.600
...bats are real close by the apes...

33:05.600 --> 33:08.800
...and just as we came
from the apes...

33:08.800 --> 33:12.400
...so might a man,
sprung from a bat.

33:12.400 --> 33:16.300
To live and hunt like a bat...

33:16.300 --> 33:20.300
...but with the cold-blooded
vengeance of a man.

33:20.300 --> 33:23.200
Even if that were true, sir, ...

33:23.200 --> 33:26.900
...how could it possibly find you
out here on an island?

33:26.900 --> 33:30.700
I needed to cut off all contact.

33:30.700 --> 33:34.300
Communication could be
only one-way.

33:34.300 --> 33:36.900
My brother helped me.

33:38.600 --> 33:41.400
And then there was my wife.

33:41.400 --> 33:45.600
It was her body your
brother pulled in.

33:46.700 --> 33:51.500
She gave up everything
to be with me.

33:53.200 --> 33:56.600
I forbade her to tell her mother.

33:57.800 --> 34:04.100
44 years on six acres of island,
she made only one demand.

34:06.500 --> 34:10.600
To be buried
in consecrated earth.

34:10.600 --> 34:14.199
She was a Catholic
her whole life.

34:24.300 --> 34:27.400
Mr. Stefaniuk...

34:28.900 --> 34:32.100
It's killed four people.

34:32.500 --> 34:36.300
All of whom would have had
traces of your scent...

34:36.300 --> 34:41.100
...through various degrees of
contact with your wife's body.

34:41.100 --> 34:44.100
- My brother?
- Your brother's okay, Ernie.

34:44.100 --> 34:48.100
But he had contact with Ariel's body.
It'll come after him, too.

34:48.100 --> 34:50.800
He's all right.
We spoke with him earlier today.

34:50.800 --> 34:52.500
Today?

34:52.500 --> 34:55.600
Today, he might have been fine but
this thing hunts likes a bat.

34:55.600 --> 34:59.300
It only attacks at night.

35:03.400 --> 35:06.400
Stay here.
Stay with him.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.100
I still don't understand.

36:13.100 --> 36:15.000
What's that?

36:15.900 --> 36:19.600
- How'd you find me out here?
- We followed your brother.

36:19.600 --> 36:23.300
No, I mean who figured it out?

36:23.300 --> 36:25.900
I was sure that what we
were looking for...

36:25.900 --> 36:29.000
...was something other than a man.

36:29.800 --> 36:34.100
The detective who was running the case
didn't believe that, and...

36:34.100 --> 36:35.600
...he's dead.

36:35.600 --> 36:39.000
But your partner, he believed it?

36:39.000 --> 36:41.200
I think he does now.

36:41.200 --> 36:44.700
So it was you who figured it.

36:45.800 --> 36:48.900
Well, I... I made the connections
but it was...

36:48.900 --> 36:52.000
...Agent Doggett that got us out here.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
You ought to be wishing he hadn't.

36:56.500 --> 36:58.500
Excuse me?

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
The moment you stepped
foot here...

37:03.000 --> 37:06.400
You're marked now,
you know that.

37:06.600 --> 37:09.200
Sir, I'm here to protect you.

37:09.200 --> 37:12.400
And how are you going to do that?

37:12.400 --> 37:17.300
You thought of everything... Except that.

37:17.300 --> 37:20.300
Well, this thing,
Mr. Stefaniuk is...

37:20.300 --> 37:24.400
...still flesh and blood.
It can be killed.

37:24.400 --> 37:27.500
What do you think? It's just going to
come walking through the door, there?

37:27.500 --> 37:31.700
It's waited 44 years. It'll wait
out there as long as it takes...

37:31.700 --> 37:34.200
...until you
can't stand it anymore.

37:34.200 --> 37:36.800
How long can you wait, huh?
A lifetime?

37:36.800 --> 37:39.200
To live in fear like this,
a young woman--

37:39.200 --> 37:41.600
...are you prepared to
sacrifice family, ...

37:41.600 --> 37:47.100
...children and spend your life
terrorized by a monster?

37:54.300 --> 37:56.000
What is that?

37:56.000 --> 37:58.600
It's ground radar.

37:58.600 --> 38:01.800
The sensor's set at ten feet high.

38:02.900 --> 38:07.400
Anything big enough to set it off
is coming in through the trees.

38:42.100 --> 38:43.400
You hear it?

38:43.400 --> 38:44.700
No.

38:45.900 --> 38:47.800
Maybe I got it.

38:48.300 --> 38:50.400
Maybe I killed it.

39:09.700 --> 39:13.200
If you've got a gun, get it.

40:44.700 --> 40:46.900
Agent Scully.

41:02.400 --> 41:05.700
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm okay.

41:05.700 --> 41:08.500
But you're not, Agent Doggett.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.800
I got you.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.600
TWO WEEKS LATER

41:45.700 --> 41:47.600
Sorry I'm late.

41:47.600 --> 41:49.600
I received a fax up in
my old office...

41:49.600 --> 41:52.800
...from Ernie's brother,
Myron Stefaniuk.

41:52.800 --> 41:55.000
He's alive? Where is he?

41:55.000 --> 41:56.700
He doesn't say.

41:56.700 --> 41:58.600
He sent this from a small
storefront business...

41:58.600 --> 42:02.300
...just across the state
line in Wyoming.

42:02.300 --> 42:04.700
He's gone into hiding.

42:08.100 --> 42:11.800
Do you believe it, Agent Doggett?

42:11.800 --> 42:14.300
Believe it?

42:14.400 --> 42:18.500
That this thing is still
out there and...

42:18.500 --> 42:21.600
...someday it's going to
come after us?

42:21.600 --> 42:25.600
I'm pretty sure I hit it,
Agent Scully.

42:25.600 --> 42:28.100
Pretty sure you hit it, too.

42:31.600 --> 42:34.700
The guys upstairs were making
some noise about this case--

42:34.700 --> 42:38.100
...about what's in our field report.

42:38.400 --> 42:40.300
Yeah.

42:40.500 --> 42:44.000
You'll get used to it.

42:48.700 --> 42:51.000
I, uh...

42:51.400 --> 42:54.400
I never had a desk in here, ...

42:55.700 --> 43:01.500
...Agent Doggett,
but I'll see that you get one.

43:01.600 --> 43:04.000
All right.

43:07.100 --> 43:10.100
