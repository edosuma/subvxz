02:13.575 --> 02:14.867
You must be hungry.

02:15.285 --> 02:17.703
You're not gonna cook, are you?

02:20.081 --> 02:22.958
Just saying, don't trouble yourself.

02:27.047 --> 02:30.174
How about some
Egg Beaters and Tabasco?

02:30.341 --> 02:32.009
That's fine.

02:32.385 --> 02:35.679
Didn't I tell you I hate this
shouting-between-rooms shit?

02:36.681 --> 02:39.349
So? You even gonna look
at the brochure?

02:42.687 --> 02:46.815
- What is it, Sneakers or something?
- Sandals.

02:47.233 --> 02:50.069
It's the jewel of Antigua.

02:50.278 --> 02:52.863
Three sun-filled days on white sand.

02:52.989 --> 02:55.074
I got A.J. on weekends.

02:55.283 --> 02:58.911
So we'll go on Monday.
Get a great rate on an ocean view.

02:59.329 --> 03:02.581
The air is the same temperature
as your body...

03:02.707 --> 03:06.335
so you don't need to wear clothes.
I gotta watch my skin in the sun.

03:06.503 --> 03:10.339
You know, you're getting a divorce,
and I see you less than before.

03:10.924 --> 03:12.466
I didn't say no.

03:12.675 --> 03:15.010
I just want your undivided attention
for once.

03:15.178 --> 03:18.305
Is it so much to fucking ask
for a little bit of atten...?

03:20.225 --> 03:22.935
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, shit.

03:25.563 --> 03:28.607
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

03:28.775 --> 03:30.692
- Oh, my God!
- I got you. All right. Okay.

03:30.860 --> 03:32.694
I got it. It's out. It's out.

03:32.987 --> 03:36.615
I got it. You're okay. You're okay.

03:39.410 --> 03:41.245
There he is.

03:41.663 --> 03:46.041
- Hey, kid, it's good to see you.
- You finally made the trip out here, huh?

03:46.209 --> 03:50.295
- Tony, this is my oldest, Charlie.
- Nice to meet you.

03:54.759 --> 03:56.552
Walk with me.

04:07.730 --> 04:10.232
- Well?
- You in that suit.

04:11.234 --> 04:13.026
Long way, huh?

04:14.154 --> 04:16.029
He lucked out. Got his mother's looks.

04:16.238 --> 04:18.322
Takes after her, too.

04:18.491 --> 04:21.451
He's in architectural salvage.

04:21.661 --> 04:24.121
Old fixtures, windows, toilets.

04:24.289 --> 04:25.622
Like Sanford and Son?

04:25.748 --> 04:27.249
Didn't I tell you he's quick?

04:27.709 --> 04:29.626
Good for you, Charlie.

04:32.797 --> 04:36.258
And this is some more
for the Joey Peeps thing.

04:36.384 --> 04:38.427
Not all of it.

04:39.721 --> 04:41.388
He's okay.

04:42.056 --> 04:44.808
- Jesus, I did a clean job.
- Fuck it. It's embarrassing.

04:45.226 --> 04:50.063
That's the way Little Carmine and Rusty
are doing things there now. I'm sorry.

04:50.190 --> 04:52.816
But Rusty, I think he bangs
his wife in installments.

04:57.238 --> 05:00.824
This guy was my old man,
my rabbi and my priest rolled into one.

05:01.034 --> 05:02.826
Even though I don't miss a day of it...

05:02.994 --> 05:04.995
the parts with this fireplug
were the best.

05:05.163 --> 05:07.789
Get the fuck out of here.

05:08.958 --> 05:11.668
Oh, I almost forgot.

05:18.426 --> 05:21.094
Spoke to me on account
of your sense of humor.

05:23.306 --> 05:26.225
I'm putting this in a position
of prominence.

05:52.460 --> 05:54.336
Hey. How you doing?

05:55.672 --> 05:59.758
Are you gonna operate on me?

05:59.926 --> 06:03.303
No, it's me, Tony.

06:03.471 --> 06:05.347
They gotta fight infection, that's all.

06:06.057 --> 06:10.143
- My hair.
- Well, the good news is it'll grow back.

06:10.270 --> 06:13.063
The burns are second-degree,
so you don't need a skin graft...

06:13.231 --> 06:15.232
or that hyperbolic chamber.

06:15.400 --> 06:18.193
You're gonna look the same
as you always did.

06:18.569 --> 06:20.320
Fuck you.

06:22.031 --> 06:23.657
All right, one second.

06:23.825 --> 06:25.367
- All right.
- It hurts.

06:25.535 --> 06:27.327
Okay, sit tight. Rest.

06:27.495 --> 06:31.164
They gotta keep you in here a couple
days so it don't get no bacteria in it.

06:31.666 --> 06:34.251
Are you gonna operate on me?

06:35.837 --> 06:37.462
I'm gonna take care of everything.

06:37.630 --> 06:43.176
The doctor bills, a wig, whatever.

06:44.095 --> 06:45.554
Don't worry about nothing.

06:45.722 --> 06:48.640
- Okay? Okay.
- Okay.

06:49.225 --> 06:51.184
I gotta go.

07:02.113 --> 07:04.323
Just put it in there.

07:10.663 --> 07:11.872
I'm gonna get some twine.

07:12.040 --> 07:14.458
- Forget it, I'm not going that far.
- All right.

07:23.885 --> 07:26.803
I know, I know, you fucking...
Come on.

07:26.971 --> 07:29.431
Let's go, move on.

07:40.234 --> 07:42.152
Fucking great.

07:47.241 --> 07:50.452
Listen, I don't know what the fuck
you were looking at...

07:51.454 --> 07:53.246
- Fuck is this?
- Ange.

07:53.456 --> 07:54.706
Sorry about that.

07:54.874 --> 07:57.709
We were on our way to your place,
and Billy sees you drive by.

07:57.877 --> 07:59.711
I tried to get your attention for blocks.

07:59.879 --> 08:02.381
Why didn't you use the fucking phone?
I'm an old man.

08:02.507 --> 08:04.299
I don't see so good in the dark.

08:04.425 --> 08:07.344
Jesus, relax.
Johnny wants to see you.

08:07.512 --> 08:09.638
This late?
Tell him I'll see him tomorrow.

08:09.847 --> 08:13.558
Apparently it's gotta be now.
You know, he's in one of his moods.

08:16.938 --> 08:21.566
- Fine. I'll follow you over.
- Whatever. Let's go.

08:34.996 --> 08:36.664
Don't!

08:43.881 --> 08:45.841
Hey! Jesus, don't!

08:46.050 --> 08:49.177
Phil, please.
Philly, Philly, you know me.

08:49.345 --> 08:51.012
- Philly.
- You couldn't fucking retire?

08:51.180 --> 08:52.806
Philly, for God's sake, you know me!

08:59.814 --> 09:01.106
Look at this shit.

09:01.274 --> 09:03.275
You know the work I just had?

09:03.443 --> 09:05.652
Give me the fucking keys.

09:15.621 --> 09:17.706
Mirsa, you seen today's paper?

09:17.874 --> 09:21.501
Everything in the kitchen, Mr. Tony.

09:35.224 --> 09:37.726
God-fucking-damn it.

09:39.812 --> 09:43.273
- You know this is today's paper?
- Oh, no.

09:43.441 --> 09:45.650
This is today's paper, Mirsa.

09:45.818 --> 09:48.236
That's I'm thinking.

09:48.404 --> 09:51.031
- Why'd you throw it away?
- Oh, no.

09:52.241 --> 09:54.409
Jesus Christ, forget it.

09:54.577 --> 09:57.579
I bake you some enchiladas you like.

09:58.122 --> 10:00.248
Thank you. That's nice of you.

10:19.644 --> 10:24.272
- These are for you. Enchiladas.
- Okay.

10:25.858 --> 10:27.984
I came for my money.

10:30.112 --> 10:32.405
Don't worry, I'll talk to Carlo
and tell him why...

10:32.573 --> 10:34.574
you're kicking up
directly to me this week.

10:34.742 --> 10:38.203
I gotta be careful getting in my cash
on account of the Carmela situation.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.038
She's all over that.

10:40.414 --> 10:44.334
- You buying that WaveRunner?
- No, I'm moving to the Plaza.

10:44.502 --> 10:47.462
My fucking house is falling down
around my ears.

10:47.797 --> 10:49.631
Well, we did good at the casino
last night.

10:49.799 --> 10:52.759
I seriously dread going home.
That fucking Guatemalan.

10:52.927 --> 10:55.262
She forgets her English
when it suits her purposes...

10:55.429 --> 10:58.848
and then she shows up whenever she
feels like with the fucking enchiladas.

10:59.058 --> 11:01.518
So fire her ass. Get a new one.

11:02.144 --> 11:04.187
This is the new one.

11:11.320 --> 11:14.823
I've been in the burn ward
a couple of nights with Valentina.

11:15.032 --> 11:17.659
Poor thing caught herself on fire.

11:19.745 --> 11:21.288
No shit?

11:21.455 --> 11:25.834
She's laying there like a rag doll,
the poor kid.

11:26.043 --> 11:29.170
That smell. Fuck, that burning-hair smell.

11:29.964 --> 11:31.840
Can still smell it.

11:34.218 --> 11:38.305
Jesus, you know that's the last thing
Carmine said before he had his stroke?

11:38.723 --> 11:39.973
He smelled burning hair.

11:45.104 --> 11:46.813
You got a Coke or something?

11:48.774 --> 11:52.819
- Ma, can you get Tony a Coke?
- I'm upstairs!

11:53.279 --> 11:56.156
Jason, Justin, get up here.

11:59.201 --> 12:01.995
- You all right?
- Just got the kids up my ass, that's all.

12:06.459 --> 12:10.795
So you come across any burn victims
at that hospital in the can?

12:12.423 --> 12:15.008
Sure, Aryan guys are always setting
each other on fire.

12:15.176 --> 12:19.262
So, what's she in for?
You know, the future, I mean.

12:19.388 --> 12:22.724
They said she don't need no skin grafts.

12:24.226 --> 12:26.519
Seriously, what the fuck is with you?

12:26.687 --> 12:28.104
I just told you.

12:33.027 --> 12:37.530
You know, the tough part is
this girl is a constant pain in my ass.

12:37.698 --> 12:40.033
I was gonna end it right there,
that night.

12:40.201 --> 12:42.661
And now how the fuck is it gonna look?

12:43.454 --> 12:45.622
That is a tough one.

12:46.248 --> 12:49.209
Why the fuck does this shit
always happen to me?

12:54.423 --> 12:56.966
You know who
I been thinking about lately?

12:57.134 --> 12:59.260
Charmaine Bucco.

12:59.428 --> 13:00.762
Nice set on her.

13:00.930 --> 13:03.390
No, not like that.

13:04.767 --> 13:07.060
Well, maybe like that.

13:07.645 --> 13:10.438
But also, she's a fantastic cook.

13:10.648 --> 13:15.610
She's better than Artie in some ways.
Plus, she's a licensed notary public.

13:15.778 --> 13:19.656
I mean, I'm thinking that
this is the kind of woman I need.

13:20.282 --> 13:23.493
And it almost worked between
me and her, right?

13:26.956 --> 13:30.208
Comic books, juice boxes,
robot crap all over the place.

13:30.376 --> 13:32.210
Get your uncle a Coke
and then your stuff.

13:32.378 --> 13:34.504
I'm taking you back
to your mom's early.

13:37.717 --> 13:38.967
I should take off.

13:39.135 --> 13:41.553
Yeah, you know,
I really gotta run them over there now.

13:41.721 --> 13:42.846
All right. Yeah.

13:43.055 --> 13:45.223
- I'll see you later.
- All right.

13:47.226 --> 13:49.811
- I'll come over to the hotel.
- Yeah.

14:06.078 --> 14:08.329
- Lawrence wedding?
- No.

14:08.497 --> 14:11.166
- Long-term or short-term?
- Can't you just park it?

14:22.428 --> 14:26.431
Here. Keep it out of the horse shit
over there, will you?

14:32.772 --> 14:35.023
Oh, yeah. Beautiful, ladies.

14:42.198 --> 14:44.824
Although you'll be paying cash,
we'll need a credit card...

14:45.034 --> 14:47.786
to secure incidental charges:
minibar, parking, et cetera.

14:47.953 --> 14:49.204
Right.

14:51.665 --> 14:54.125
- Here.
- Thank you.

14:57.254 --> 14:59.297
Oh, Jill, that's so funny.

14:59.465 --> 15:01.716
Very good, Mr. Petraglia.

15:01.884 --> 15:05.595
We have you in a deluxe suite
with a park view.

15:05.763 --> 15:07.263
My name is Sharice...

15:07.389 --> 15:09.641
and along with our
24-hour concierge service...

15:09.809 --> 15:12.685
I'm here to see that
you enjoy your stay with us.

15:12.853 --> 15:15.313
- Great.
- The bellman will show you to your room.

15:15.481 --> 15:17.482
Enjoy your stay, Mr. Petraglia.

15:24.698 --> 15:28.660
Anything else I can do,
press nine, ask for Jesús.

15:31.038 --> 15:32.580
- For you.
- Thank you, sir.

15:32.706 --> 15:34.624
- Enjoy your stay.
- Thanks.

16:29.471 --> 16:31.264
Hello?

16:32.558 --> 16:33.850
Hello?

16:34.977 --> 16:36.185
Hello?

16:36.979 --> 16:39.898
Whoever you are,
I'd like you to stop this.

17:02.588 --> 17:03.796
Hmmm

17:07.425 --> 17:12.221
Whether it's the Vanderbilt Suite
or an elegant deluxe standard room...

17:12.348 --> 17:15.767
the Plaza is equipped with
a state-of-the-art safety system...

17:15.935 --> 17:17.435
and a well-trained staff.

17:17.645 --> 17:21.064
The gentle pleasures and
mysterious ways of the East...

17:21.231 --> 17:24.983
more than the ladies of Jade Escorts.

17:25.152 --> 17:30.365
New York's most exotic and erotic girls
are waiting to please you.

17:30.532 --> 17:36.204
Call 1-900-555-JADE...

17:36.372 --> 17:41.042
and let them satisfy your every need.

17:41.251 --> 17:44.295
All major credit cards are accepted.

17:44.463 --> 17:46.881
What are you waiting for?

18:21.625 --> 18:23.251
Been trying to reach you.

18:23.460 --> 18:25.169
Angelo got it.

18:25.337 --> 18:28.297
Last night. Probably Phil.

18:50.487 --> 18:51.863
I'm not available right now.

18:52.031 --> 18:55.283
- Don't leave messages on this phone.
- Fuck.

19:00.831 --> 19:02.540
- Hello?
- Who's this?

19:02.666 --> 19:05.251
- It's Dot, who's this?
- It's Tony, looking for Ton.

19:05.627 --> 19:08.421
Oh, he's not here.
He didn't come in tonight at all.

19:08.547 --> 19:11.674
He might be in later, though.
You wanna try his portable phone?

19:11.884 --> 19:13.301
I did.

19:13.427 --> 19:16.554
You see him,
you have him call me immediately.

19:16.722 --> 19:18.723
Okay, will do.

19:35.324 --> 19:37.116
- Hello?
- Yeah, Aunt Quin...

19:37.284 --> 19:39.494
it's Tony, looking for Ton.

19:39.661 --> 19:43.331
- Madonna, I hoped he was with you.
- You heard from him?

19:43.499 --> 19:46.501
Not since he took the kids back
this morning.

19:46.627 --> 19:48.753
- Call me if you hear, you understand?
- Yeah.

19:48.921 --> 19:51.089
- You got my cell?
- Yeah.

19:51.256 --> 19:53.216
What's wrong?

19:58.555 --> 20:00.973
- Yeah.
- You seen my cousin?

20:01.141 --> 20:04.352
No. But I heard about that thing
last night.

20:04.520 --> 20:06.521
The old-timer was a standup guy.

20:06.688 --> 20:09.107
Yeah, well, that's the least of it.

20:10.734 --> 20:11.943
Hold on. Hold on.

20:17.366 --> 20:20.243
- Hey, you call for a date?
- Yeah, yeah.

20:20.452 --> 20:23.121
- Got company?
- Yeah.

20:23.455 --> 20:25.123
- Hold on a second.
- Can I get a drink?

20:25.290 --> 20:26.999
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:30.045 --> 20:33.297
- I wanna know the minute he surfaces.
- You got it.

20:33.465 --> 20:35.800
I saw him this morning.
He must have known something.

20:35.968 --> 20:38.970
- He was acting all squirrelly.
- He's got a right to be upset.

20:39.138 --> 20:41.222
After what him and Ange
been through together.

20:41.348 --> 20:44.892
- They were cellmates at Allenwood.
- I don't know, I got a bad feeling.

20:45.060 --> 20:48.855
Don't worry about it.
He ain't that stupid.

20:49.356 --> 20:50.982
Yeah, you're probably right.

20:51.108 --> 20:53.234
We'll let you know if we see him.

21:04.746 --> 21:07.623
You want me to suck your dick now,
baby?

21:08.500 --> 21:10.835
Is that what you want, baby?

21:21.388 --> 21:23.598
What the fuck!

21:26.435 --> 21:28.394
Tony, I'm so lonely.

21:30.272 --> 21:31.647
I miss my Violet.

21:31.815 --> 21:35.234
- What violin?
- Violet, my wife.

21:35.611 --> 21:37.737
She was everything to me.

21:39.573 --> 21:42.408
I'm all alone on the other side.

21:42.576 --> 21:44.619
It ain't right.

21:53.045 --> 21:54.503
Answer the fucking thing.

22:00.260 --> 22:02.220
If it's him, tell him you ain't seen me.

22:02.888 --> 22:06.974
- Tell who?
- The man upstairs.

22:14.441 --> 22:17.777
- Hello.
- We need you to do something.

22:24.201 --> 22:25.618
Like what?

22:25.744 --> 22:29.247
Our friend. He's gotta go.

22:31.124 --> 22:32.625
No problem.

22:32.793 --> 22:36.796
- Don't fuck it up, it's important.
- I know it's important.

22:45.347 --> 22:47.556
He was staring straight at me.

22:47.724 --> 22:49.517
But he didn't look dead.

22:50.227 --> 22:52.895
Any deader than he ever did, anyways.

22:57.025 --> 23:01.779
And he says, "I miss my wife."

23:02.948 --> 23:05.241
Then the phone rings...

23:06.493 --> 23:08.452
and there was this voice.

23:09.454 --> 23:13.249
- They wanted me to do something.
- What?

23:16.044 --> 23:18.170
They wanted me to kill a guy.

23:18.547 --> 23:21.257
It was just a dream, all right?

23:24.011 --> 23:26.679
He must be in heaven.
He said "the other side."

23:27.139 --> 23:29.682
But it was so fucking sad.

23:30.642 --> 23:32.810
Doesn't sound like heaven to me.

23:33.020 --> 23:35.438
Well, you would know more
about it than I do.

23:39.735 --> 23:41.944
What'd you see in me, anyways?

23:42.070 --> 23:46.365
The object is to learn what
you saw in me, not what I saw in you.

23:46.533 --> 23:49.744
One of these days, Alice.
One of these days.

23:49.870 --> 23:52.038
Pow, right in the kisser?

23:52.247 --> 23:53.789
To the moon, Alice!

23:53.957 --> 23:57.668
I remember when you hit me,
it was like, pow, to the moon.

23:57.836 --> 23:59.420
Don't get me steamed, Alice.

23:59.546 --> 24:01.672
And then you choked
the shit out of me!

24:01.840 --> 24:05.051
Yeah, but that's after you were trying
to put a fork in my eye.

24:05.260 --> 24:07.178
No, that was your mother!

24:16.438 --> 24:18.981
Sometimes what happens here
is like taking a shit.

24:19.107 --> 24:21.901
I prefer to think of it as
more like childbirth.

24:22.861 --> 24:25.404
Maybe it is more like childbirth.

24:25.572 --> 24:27.490
You tell me.

24:28.742 --> 24:30.993
I don't have any children.

24:33.872 --> 24:35.790
I died too young.

24:42.172 --> 24:44.632
My cousin does a mean Gleason.

24:54.601 --> 24:56.769
Are you ready
for what you have to do?

24:57.270 --> 25:00.731
No sweat. I did my homework.

25:25.424 --> 25:28.509
- You wanna ride up front?
- No, Dad, I'm fine.

25:30.512 --> 25:33.180
Kid gets sick in the back seat.

25:40.230 --> 25:42.815
You know, douche bag,
I realize I'm dreaming.

25:43.233 --> 25:46.735
I got no opinion one way or the other.

25:48.447 --> 25:49.947
Anybody mind?

25:53.910 --> 25:55.035
What?

25:59.207 --> 26:00.958
Where we going?

26:04.004 --> 26:05.546
Driving you to the job.

26:29.321 --> 26:31.447
Oh, Jesus, you scared me.

26:32.657 --> 26:35.284
And you're not even ready.
We gotta meet Finn's parents.

26:35.660 --> 26:37.119
Why didn't you wake me up?

26:37.287 --> 26:38.704
Is that how you're gonna dress?

26:39.164 --> 26:40.915
My stuff isn't here.

26:41.249 --> 26:43.042
Well, you left your brown suit.

26:43.251 --> 26:44.835
I did?

26:47.589 --> 26:48.839
And we're late.

26:49.257 --> 26:51.258
I had the worst fucking dream.

26:51.426 --> 26:53.886
Tony, we're late.
And we should take separate cars.

26:54.429 --> 26:56.055
Oh, yeah.

26:57.098 --> 26:58.516
Howdy.

26:58.975 --> 27:02.561
You were riding out here the other day,
weren't you?

27:04.356 --> 27:06.106
You speak English?

27:10.153 --> 27:12.571
- Tony.
- What? Give me a minute.

27:12.739 --> 27:14.365
Can you pull yourself away for once?

27:14.533 --> 27:16.200
Your head is filled with this stuff.

27:17.160 --> 27:18.869
It's just that it's...

27:19.454 --> 27:20.996
so much more interesting.

27:21.248 --> 27:22.498
Than what?

27:23.124 --> 27:24.458
Than life.

27:24.626 --> 27:27.002
What, are you kidding me?
It is your life.

27:30.966 --> 27:32.216
Good morning, señor.

27:34.052 --> 27:36.178
Tell me, what day is it?

27:36.304 --> 27:39.181
What day?
Why, it's Christmas Day, of course, sir.

27:39.307 --> 27:43.644
Christmas Day? Christmas...?
Then I haven't missed it.

27:44.229 --> 27:46.522
The spirits must have
done everything in one night.

27:47.816 --> 27:49.692
- Of course.
- Will you please get dressed?

27:50.068 --> 27:51.944
Of course they can.

28:05.500 --> 28:07.209
Look at you.

28:09.087 --> 28:10.963
All right, let's go.

28:14.843 --> 28:16.802
I'll wait in the car.

28:20.515 --> 28:22.433
I'll wait in the car.

28:24.811 --> 28:26.770
Now what's the matter?

28:26.938 --> 28:28.355
Nothing.

28:35.280 --> 28:37.406
- Are you coming?
- Yeah.

28:40.619 --> 28:43.787
Hi. How are you both?

29:01.181 --> 29:03.641
There you are.
I was getting so nervous.

29:03.850 --> 29:05.392
Hey, babe.

29:05.560 --> 29:07.561
We were about to start
calling the hospitals.

29:07.729 --> 29:09.647
Somebody forgot.

29:09.856 --> 29:13.442
I'd like you to meet Finn's parents,
Mr. DeTrolio, Mrs. DeTrolio.

29:13.652 --> 29:15.444
- How do you do?
- Hi, how are you?

29:15.612 --> 29:17.946
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

29:20.825 --> 29:24.036
We've been enjoying getting to know
your daughter while we were waiting.

29:28.249 --> 29:29.792
So how's the food here?

29:29.959 --> 29:31.293
It's pretty good.

29:31.461 --> 29:34.296
We went to high school
with the owner and his wife.

29:34.464 --> 29:36.799
You two were
high school sweethearts?

29:43.431 --> 29:45.182
So how long can you stay?

29:45.308 --> 29:47.184
Something I have to take care of.

29:47.519 --> 29:48.519
Ohhh

29:49.062 --> 29:50.813
Show them what you have
in your pocket.

29:58.863 --> 30:02.408
With a husband in dental school,
he'll be able to fix your mouth, honey.

30:02.659 --> 30:04.660
Then, for the capper...

30:09.999 --> 30:11.834
Son of a bitch.

30:13.044 --> 30:16.714
We know all about you,
and I think it's great.

30:16.881 --> 30:18.716
Well, that's a relief, huh, Tony?

30:18.883 --> 30:20.175
Speaking of dental school...

30:20.343 --> 30:23.053
people always told us Finn
would never amount to much.

30:23.263 --> 30:25.723
He won't. I think the die is cast.

30:25.849 --> 30:28.934
Yeah, if it wasn't for his tooth-fairy
money, he'd have nothing.

30:29.102 --> 30:31.228
Let's not get into it in front
of other people.

30:31.604 --> 30:33.647
- Well, you're the one that said...
- Never mind.

30:33.815 --> 30:35.816
Please, just drop it.

30:38.611 --> 30:43.031
- Meadow, do you play an instrument?
- I was in chamber singers.

30:43.241 --> 30:45.659
I used to sing in the Navy Glee Club.

31:18.276 --> 31:20.194
You're Annette Bening.

31:20.361 --> 31:21.987
I thought so.

31:55.271 --> 31:57.147
What?

32:00.026 --> 32:01.610
Something bad is gonna happen.

32:20.004 --> 32:21.463
Well...

32:22.090 --> 32:26.051
After I sing,
I can usually use a nice tinkle.

32:26.219 --> 32:27.511
I'll go with you.

32:27.679 --> 32:30.556
I don't want my husband coming out
with just his cock in his hand.

32:30.723 --> 32:32.641
Mine either, believe me.

32:53.830 --> 32:55.664
Oh, that feels good.

32:57.250 --> 32:58.876
You don't do this no more, huh?

32:59.043 --> 33:00.711
No.

33:04.674 --> 33:06.675
Got a good boy out there.

33:06.843 --> 33:09.052
You gonna be able
to come through on the thing?

33:10.680 --> 33:12.681
I did my homework.

33:15.476 --> 33:17.102
Yeah?

33:17.687 --> 33:21.023
Well, the piece wasn't behind the toilet.

33:21.149 --> 33:23.442
- Well, this is real life.
- No, it's not.

33:25.236 --> 33:26.695
This is it.

33:31.326 --> 33:32.993
No! Stop!

33:40.627 --> 33:42.461
I knew this was gonna happen.

33:42.712 --> 33:44.963
Why didn't you stop him?

34:03.524 --> 34:05.233
Please.

34:11.449 --> 34:13.241
You have any idea what you just did?

34:13.409 --> 34:15.577
Tell them what happened 20 years ago.

34:15.745 --> 34:17.829
I can't go into that right now.

34:22.210 --> 34:25.128
What do I gotta count to
before I can get up?

34:25.295 --> 34:27.672
- Tony?
- You're really dead.

34:27.966 --> 34:29.841
But I got kids.

34:30.009 --> 34:31.259
They got kids.

34:37.016 --> 34:38.766
Yo, wasn't that Tony there...

34:38.935 --> 34:41.895
the guy you were supposed to cap
to prevent this from happening?

34:42.438 --> 34:44.147
I don't know.

34:45.858 --> 34:47.067
I guess not.

34:48.402 --> 34:49.902
I don't have a piece.

34:52.699 --> 34:54.199
Annette Bening?

34:54.367 --> 34:56.618
There's something Bugsy about him.

35:16.806 --> 35:18.932
Get him!

35:33.781 --> 35:35.449
Over here.

35:48.296 --> 35:49.838
I'm wiped out.

35:59.015 --> 36:00.599
The fuck you doing to yourself?

36:04.562 --> 36:06.313
What's that noise?

36:06.481 --> 36:09.441
It's those micks outside the hotel
with those carriage rides.

36:09.650 --> 36:12.319
- Tell them to go away.
- Oh, God, Tony.

36:12.487 --> 36:14.446
It's so much better
than when we were kids.

36:14.614 --> 36:16.865
- See, what'd I tell you? The best, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

36:17.033 --> 36:19.659
She likes it when you rub her muzzle.

36:29.003 --> 36:30.629
Think I wanna come home.

36:30.797 --> 36:32.923
There are some
nonnegotiable conditions.

36:33.257 --> 36:35.634
- Like what?
- You can't have your horse in here.

36:35.802 --> 36:37.511
- Why not?
- Are you kidding me?

36:37.678 --> 36:40.055
The smell, and shit all over the place.

36:40.223 --> 36:41.640
I'll clean up after her.

36:41.808 --> 36:43.058
You always say that.

36:46.646 --> 36:48.021
I'll have to think about it.

36:48.147 --> 36:50.023
You're the one brought it up.

36:52.443 --> 36:53.693
I should go.

36:55.071 --> 36:56.655
You didn't take care of that?

36:58.449 --> 36:59.950
What?

37:00.785 --> 37:02.494
Check this out.

37:04.455 --> 37:06.373
Be careful.

38:56.943 --> 38:59.569
I know you're there, Soprano.

39:05.159 --> 39:08.161
Well, come on.
You're gonna do it, do it.

39:18.923 --> 39:22.342
- Well, look at you.
- How you doing, Coach Molinaro?

39:22.802 --> 39:24.636
Me, I'm fine.

39:24.845 --> 39:26.179
What's that you got there?

39:26.305 --> 39:28.640
A bigger dingus
than the one God gave you?

39:30.518 --> 39:32.769
You dumb-ass.

39:33.646 --> 39:35.814
You know, you ought to show
some respect.

39:36.899 --> 39:39.985
- Why?
- Because I'm not some kid anymore.

39:40.278 --> 39:41.528
No.

39:45.992 --> 39:47.242
What did I tell you?

39:47.410 --> 39:50.078
"Cleave yourself away from them bums
you hang with," I said.

39:50.746 --> 39:52.414
Well, I'm in therapy now.

39:54.208 --> 39:55.834
That's a damn shame.

39:57.545 --> 39:59.713
You all listened
to that pismire Arthur Bucco.

39:59.880 --> 40:02.173
He was the worst of the bunch.
I told you that.

40:02.341 --> 40:03.550
Artie owns a restaurant.

40:03.718 --> 40:06.011
- He's doing great.
- Bucco?

40:06.178 --> 40:07.345
Yeah.

40:07.513 --> 40:09.264
The exception that proves the rule.

40:09.390 --> 40:11.099
Oh, you know everything, don't you?

40:11.225 --> 40:15.353
I suppose you blame your father when
you're crying to that shrink of yours.

40:15.730 --> 40:17.647
No, more my mother.

40:19.317 --> 40:20.859
Of course. Even better.

40:21.235 --> 40:24.029
Well, my family was different
than other kids' families.

40:24.238 --> 40:27.490
You know, I'll bet you got that
psychologist wrapped around your finger.

40:27.742 --> 40:30.118
That's what you always told me
I was good at, right?

40:30.286 --> 40:33.246
I also told you, most likely...

40:33.456 --> 40:35.749
you'd take the easy way out.

40:38.461 --> 40:40.003
It hasn't been easy.

40:41.005 --> 40:42.630
I see you on TV.

40:43.174 --> 40:44.424
Oh, yeah?

40:44.592 --> 40:46.009
Some show you put on.

40:47.303 --> 40:48.553
The 5:00 news.

40:48.721 --> 40:51.389
Then you realize I got nothing
to apologize to you for.

40:51.640 --> 40:53.058
Eighteen, 20, 22...

40:53.851 --> 40:55.185
I am a leader.

40:55.853 --> 40:57.520
Got a house worth a million two.

40:57.688 --> 40:59.564
Two kids, wife.

40:59.732 --> 41:01.983
- Twenty-eight... Do you?
- Do I what?

41:02.151 --> 41:03.651
- Have a wife?
- Yeah.

41:03.819 --> 41:06.654
She's got the big house
because I'm successful.

41:07.823 --> 41:09.532
You and I know your little secret.

41:09.700 --> 41:12.744
I only told you I wanted to be a coach
because I liked playing ball.

41:12.912 --> 41:15.413
But I was just shining you on,
because that's what I do.

41:15.581 --> 41:19.250
I told you many times, Anthony,
you were special.

41:19.460 --> 41:22.754
You had smarts, personality,
leadership potential.

41:22.922 --> 41:25.924
All the prerequisites to lead young men
onto the field of sport.

41:26.092 --> 41:28.009
And now look at the stress you live with.

41:38.479 --> 41:39.646
You're not prepared!

41:49.240 --> 41:50.532
You'll never shut me up.

42:35.119 --> 42:36.369
Yeah?

42:36.537 --> 42:39.038
We're sorry to disturb you
at this hour, Mr. Petraglia...

42:39.248 --> 42:41.040
but there's a Mr. Mantovani
to see you.

42:41.250 --> 42:44.002
- He says it's urgent.
- Send him up.

43:22.958 --> 43:24.626
Hey.

43:28.047 --> 43:31.299
Sorry to get you up, but I knew
you'd wanna know right away.

43:32.384 --> 43:34.093
Know what?

43:34.470 --> 43:36.387
Tony B. took out Billy Leotardo.

43:38.432 --> 43:39.516
Yeah.

43:39.683 --> 43:42.894
- Wait a minute, you mean Philly.
- Billy. Phil got winged.

43:43.062 --> 43:44.979
He's in the hospital.

43:45.105 --> 43:47.023
T.B. went ape over Angelo.

43:47.233 --> 43:49.901
Phil's holding his brother
as the kid's dying in his arms.

43:50.027 --> 43:52.445
There's blood all over Phil.

43:52.863 --> 43:54.447
Jesus.

43:56.408 --> 43:58.243
So he knew.

43:59.245 --> 44:01.454
Goddamn him.

44:02.790 --> 44:04.165
He knew what he was gonna do...

44:04.333 --> 44:07.168
and he sat there, right in his
mother's house, and pretended.

44:07.586 --> 44:09.921
Lied right to my face.

44:10.923 --> 44:12.966
I don't know what to say.

44:13.259 --> 44:15.969
Guess T.B.'s fucked, the poor guy.

44:17.388 --> 44:19.138
Poor guy?

44:19.682 --> 44:21.766
We're all fucked.

44:23.435 --> 44:25.937
I'm here for you, whatever.

44:26.647 --> 44:28.439
I know that.

44:32.653 --> 44:34.696
Nice suite, T.

44:36.865 --> 44:40.159
Anyway, thought you needed to know
right away.

44:42.788 --> 44:44.956
You gonna eat that?

44:46.750 --> 44:49.586
- No, take it.
- Thanks.

44:50.045 --> 44:52.964
Right. See you later.

45:55.653 --> 45:56.903
Hello?

45:57.071 --> 46:00.239
Yeah, don't get alarmed.
I'm sorry to call you so early...

46:00.658 --> 46:02.617
but I gotta cancel the fishing trip.

46:02.785 --> 46:04.369
Tell A.J.

46:04.536 --> 46:07.455
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

46:12.920 --> 46:15.463
I had one of my Coach Molinaro dreams.

46:17.841 --> 46:21.219
Oh, yeah?
Were you unprepared, as usual?

46:22.304 --> 46:25.139
Yeah. As usual.

46:25.265 --> 46:27.100
Yeah, Mr. Mol.

46:27.226 --> 46:28.976
I wonder where he is now.

46:29.144 --> 46:30.853
He wasn't such a bad guy.

46:31.146 --> 46:33.898
A bad guy? No.
He actually took an interest in you.

46:34.024 --> 46:35.400
A lot of that was bullshit.

46:35.567 --> 46:38.569
It was just his way of keeping me
from causing trouble.

46:38.737 --> 46:40.571
Make his life easier.

46:40.739 --> 46:42.657
I don't know about that.

46:45.619 --> 46:49.622
I told him in the dream,
I am sort of a coach now.

46:51.250 --> 46:54.043
Yeah, that's a way
of looking at it, I guess.

47:00.050 --> 47:01.801
Is it daylight where you are?

47:04.054 --> 47:05.888
No. Where are you?

47:06.348 --> 47:08.725
Looking out at Central Park.

47:11.979 --> 47:13.646
All the lights are on.

47:18.318 --> 47:19.652
You were in the dream too.

47:20.237 --> 47:21.738
Oh, yeah?

47:21.905 --> 47:24.073
I was on this horse.

47:28.662 --> 47:30.663
Anyway, is Artie all right?

47:30.831 --> 47:33.541
Because in the dream,
he was the only alive guy...

47:33.667 --> 47:35.418
in this car full of dead guys.

47:35.627 --> 47:37.837
I had dinner over there last night.

47:38.797 --> 47:40.548
Who'd you eat with?

47:42.301 --> 47:43.843
Gab and Ro.

47:44.344 --> 47:45.553
That's nice.

47:45.721 --> 47:49.140
Yeah, it was all right.
The veal was very dry.

47:52.936 --> 47:55.104
Is that Esterhaz next door barking?

47:55.272 --> 47:58.608
- Can you hear him?
- Absolutely.

47:59.109 --> 48:01.402
Five-thirty in the morning.

48:02.696 --> 48:06.157
Someone ought to serve
him some veal. À la strychnine.

48:07.826 --> 48:10.453
- Stop it.
- I'm serious.

48:11.288 --> 48:13.456
Is it light where you are yet?

48:14.305 --> 48:20.480
