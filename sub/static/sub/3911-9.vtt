00:01.970 --> 00:03.940
<i>Previously on</i>
"Tyrant"

00:03.940 --> 00:05.440
- (Nusrat gasps)
- The baby didn't make it,

00:05.440 --> 00:07.410
and we had to perform
a hysterectomy.

00:07.410 --> 00:08.910
No more children.

00:08.910 --> 00:10.380
(Leila) The people of
Abuddin need an heir.

00:10.380 --> 00:12.450
You'll tell him
you want the marriage annulled.

00:12.450 --> 00:14.980
You have to trust someone
on the ground inside Ma'an.

00:14.980 --> 00:16.480
Right now,
 you have no one.

00:16.480 --> 00:17.720
I want to trust you,

00:17.720 --> 00:18.990
but I need
 something reliable.

00:18.990 --> 00:20.090
A Caliphate target.

00:20.090 --> 00:22.660
Abu Omar is arresting
five families.

00:22.660 --> 00:25.830
Christian and other minorities
he thinks are supporting you.

00:25.830 --> 00:28.090
- When's it happening?
- Tonight.

00:28.100 --> 00:30.330
I put my neck on the line
to get you on this.

00:30.330 --> 00:32.630
(explosion, fire whooshing)

00:32.630 --> 00:33.900
(Barry) He's alive.

00:33.900 --> 00:35.300
(Rami) <i>Khalil...
 he's the break</i>

00:35.300 --> 00:36.400
<i>we've been waiting for.</i>

00:36.400 --> 00:38.000
Before I involved you,

00:38.010 --> 00:39.070
I had to test him.

00:39.070 --> 00:40.970
That decision was mine,
not yours.

00:40.980 --> 00:44.610
This man, Khalil... I want
to talk to him myself.

00:44.610 --> 00:46.850
I mean, I can't.

00:46.850 --> 00:48.410
Why? Move on.

00:48.420 --> 00:49.620
(Sammy) There's a man
 inside Ma'an

00:49.620 --> 00:50.680
who's fighting
 the Caliphate,

00:50.690 --> 00:51.890
and I'm giving him
 my money.

00:53.890 --> 00:56.690
(Sammy gasps)

01:01.300 --> 01:04.360
(crickets chirping)

01:35.900 --> 01:37.160
(ringtone playing)

01:37.170 --> 01:39.070
(gasps)

01:39.070 --> 01:40.900
Sammy?

01:43.000 --> 01:45.540
(Barry) Molly...

01:45.540 --> 01:47.610
it's Barry.

01:50.680 --> 01:53.080
It's me, Molly.
 It's Barry.

01:53.080 --> 01:55.150
No.

01:55.150 --> 01:57.350
That's not possible.

01:57.350 --> 01:59.220
Molly...

02:00.190 --> 02:02.890
- (Molly shivering)
- Molly, I need to talk to you.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.850
There are things
I need to tell you.

02:08.330 --> 02:11.030
Molly, you there?

02:11.030 --> 02:12.770
Molly?

02:14.700 --> 02:16.370
Molly?

02:16.370 --> 02:18.440
(gasps)

02:21.510 --> 02:24.510
(sobbing)

02:24.510 --> 02:27.510
(TV playing quietly)
(hinges squeaking)

02:29.220 --> 02:31.420
Good morning.

02:31.420 --> 02:33.190
I'm worried about you, Jamal.

02:33.190 --> 02:35.190
You never came to bed
last night.

02:35.190 --> 02:37.020
(groans)

02:37.030 --> 02:39.630
Did I tell you
 the sheik told me

02:39.630 --> 02:42.130
the real threat... 
the poison...

02:42.130 --> 02:44.800
was inside the palace?

02:46.530 --> 02:48.370
I don't know
what you're talking about,

02:48.370 --> 02:50.800
and I'm not sure you know
what you're talking about.

02:50.810 --> 02:52.610
(clears throat) Rami, my son...

02:52.610 --> 02:56.440
he had the chance to destroy
the Caliphate leadership,

02:56.440 --> 02:59.880
but he didn't take it.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.310
Could be him.

03:01.320 --> 03:04.650
That son of yours
is a professional.

03:06.220 --> 03:07.250
You wanted him here.

03:07.260 --> 03:09.890
He is here to help you.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.990
He is sneaking around
like Tariq.

03:11.990 --> 03:13.660
He's not telling me things.

03:13.660 --> 03:16.160
I can't have it.

03:16.160 --> 03:18.000
Not again.

03:24.140 --> 03:26.140
(hinges squeaking)

03:26.140 --> 03:29.180
(water splashing)
(Ahmed) Pick a country.

03:29.180 --> 03:30.480
What are you talking about?

03:30.480 --> 03:34.010
Ah, pick a country, 
any country,

03:34.020 --> 03:37.180
any spot on Earth,
 and we'll go.

03:37.190 --> 03:40.650
For two weeks, a month,

03:40.660 --> 03:44.020
as long as it takes
 to heal.

03:44.030 --> 03:46.130
To smile.

03:46.130 --> 03:48.190
Just the two of us.

03:52.170 --> 03:54.930
Ahmed, that's not
going to happen.

03:54.940 --> 03:57.100
I know there's a war,

03:57.110 --> 04:00.210
but I have great faith
in my stepbrother.

04:00.210 --> 04:04.180
He'll wrap this up quickly,
and as soon as it's done...

04:04.180 --> 04:06.280
(sniffs)

04:06.280 --> 04:09.150
we should go someplace.

04:09.150 --> 04:12.080
Ahmed, we need to get
our marriage annulled.

04:16.519 --> 04:18.589
(clears throat)

04:22.460 --> 04:24.200
What are you talking about?

04:25.200 --> 04:28.170
I can't have a baby.

04:28.170 --> 04:30.700
And you have
 to have a baby.

04:30.710 --> 04:31.970
No.

04:31.970 --> 04:34.710
I don't have
 to have anything.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.510
I have to take care of you.

04:38.510 --> 04:40.350
That's the only thing
I have to have.

04:40.350 --> 04:44.150
You're not being
honest with yourself.

04:44.150 --> 04:47.150
You need to find someone
who can give you a child.

04:47.160 --> 04:48.890
But we love each other,

04:48.890 --> 04:51.420
and I don't care
if I have a child,

04:51.430 --> 04:52.990
as long as I have you.

04:52.990 --> 04:54.990
- But your parents.
- What are they going to do?

04:55.000 --> 04:56.230
Disown me?

04:56.230 --> 04:58.260
- They might. 
- Then let them.

04:58.270 --> 04:59.270
I'll get a job.

04:59.270 --> 05:01.930
I'll find a way
 to support us.

05:03.870 --> 05:05.170
I love you.

05:05.170 --> 05:07.110
And I'm willing
to fight for you.

05:09.180 --> 05:12.080
I don't want you
to fight for me.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.790
I just...

05:25.360 --> 05:28.130
I just want it to be over.

05:30.130 --> 05:32.200
Really.

05:34.140 --> 05:36.300
(Rami) In three nights time,
the meteorological service

05:36.300 --> 05:39.210
is predicting a likely
sandstorm in Ma'an.

05:39.210 --> 05:41.370
It will provide
perfect cover for us.

05:41.380 --> 05:43.380
Planes cannot take off
 or land.

05:43.380 --> 05:45.210
Cars and tanks
are largely crippled.

05:45.210 --> 05:46.480
(Rami) Based
 on the current

05:46.480 --> 05:49.980
weather models,
the storm is likely to last

05:49.980 --> 05:51.420
- two to three hours.
- Mm.

05:51.420 --> 05:53.250
In those two
 to three hours,

05:53.250 --> 05:54.920
if we can take out
the Caliphate's

05:54.920 --> 05:57.320
antiaircraft capability,
the second the storm lifts,

05:57.330 --> 05:59.290
we can fly in troops
and equipment

05:59.290 --> 06:02.330
and commence bombing runs
to support our ground forces.

06:02.330 --> 06:04.230
Now...

06:04.230 --> 06:06.770
given the size
 of the force

06:06.770 --> 06:09.940
that Solomon and I
have assembled,

06:09.940 --> 06:11.940
Ma'an should be ours
within a week.

06:11.940 --> 06:14.510
Well, excellent.

06:14.510 --> 06:18.140
Hopefully, God is on our side
once again.

06:20.350 --> 06:21.950
Brilliant.

06:21.950 --> 06:23.820
The key to this, of course,

06:23.820 --> 06:26.250
is getting Khalil and his
Red Hand Brigade on board.

06:26.250 --> 06:28.420
They're already in Ma'an,
and they're the logical choice

06:28.420 --> 06:30.320
to take out the antiaircraft
guns during the storm.

06:30.320 --> 06:32.420
So if you just share
his number with me,

06:32.430 --> 06:33.660
I'll give him a call.

06:33.660 --> 06:36.030
Share his number?

06:36.030 --> 06:37.760
(chuckles)

06:37.770 --> 06:39.630
- Is something wrong, Mr. President?
- Yes.

06:39.630 --> 06:43.540
Lately, when I leave planning
to others,

06:43.540 --> 06:45.770
things go badly.

06:45.770 --> 06:48.510
I and only I will speak
to Khalil.

06:51.880 --> 06:53.210
Don't look so sad.

06:53.210 --> 06:56.180
If it's God's will,
it will happen.

06:58.120 --> 07:00.120
(insects buzzing)

07:00.120 --> 07:02.220
(indistinct chattering)
(woman crying softly)

07:02.220 --> 07:03.460
(Ihab) <i>Praise to God</i>

07:03.460 --> 07:05.790
that you did not get hurt
too badly yesterday.

07:05.790 --> 07:09.300
So many of your comrades
lost their lives.

07:09.300 --> 07:11.330
You must feel blessed.

07:11.330 --> 07:12.670
Huh?

07:12.670 --> 07:14.130
(whispers) Yeah.

07:14.140 --> 07:16.300
Tell me, to what, uh,

07:16.300 --> 07:19.840
do you think you owe
this great good luck?

07:19.840 --> 07:21.210
Timing, I guess.

07:21.210 --> 07:22.410
Timing?

07:22.410 --> 07:24.210
Timing, yes.
(people chat indistinctly in background)

07:24.210 --> 07:26.310
Timing is everything.
(people chat indistinctly in background)

07:26.310 --> 07:29.480
Well, timing and information.

07:29.480 --> 07:33.220
Knowing what is going to happen
before it happens.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.650
That is... That is
the ultimate good luck.

07:37.530 --> 07:40.860
Isn't it?

07:40.860 --> 07:46.330
So, you helped, uh,
with the mission yesterday.

07:46.330 --> 07:48.700
So you knew which families,
which houses,

07:48.700 --> 07:52.070
were going to be visited
and at what time.

07:52.070 --> 07:54.170
Apparently, so did
 the Red Hand.

07:55.910 --> 07:57.280
Apparently?

07:57.280 --> 07:59.080
- I don't... 
- The night...

07:59.080 --> 08:03.420
that my wife
 was murdered,

08:03.420 --> 08:05.850
(clicks lips) your father's
youngest wife escaped.

08:05.850 --> 08:08.090
You knew where
they were being held.

08:08.090 --> 08:10.560
You also knew
that no one else was there,

08:10.560 --> 08:14.130
and apparently
so did the Red Hand.

08:14.130 --> 08:15.530
Oh, no, no, no,
 no, no, no.

08:15.530 --> 08:17.460
Everyone knew
she was at Abu Omar's.

08:17.470 --> 08:19.060
Hmm.

08:19.070 --> 08:20.900
Everyone knew
his brother was visiting

08:20.900 --> 08:23.870
and you would all be at
a huge dinner in his honor.

08:23.870 --> 08:24.870
Hmm.

08:24.870 --> 08:26.410
Everyone knew that.

08:26.410 --> 08:29.910
The night the Red Hand
invaded our prisons,

08:29.910 --> 08:31.880
how did they know
 how to get in?

08:31.880 --> 08:33.580
How did they know
how to get out?

08:33.580 --> 08:35.380
I... I have no idea.
I don't know. I...

08:35.380 --> 08:36.650
Maybe, maybe...

08:36.650 --> 08:40.549
someone had a relative...
perhaps a brother...

08:40.549 --> 08:43.960
who worked at the prison
and could offer insight

08:43.960 --> 08:46.190
into vulnerabilities
 and such.

08:47.400 --> 08:49.160
(gulps) No.

08:49.160 --> 08:50.560
No.

08:50.560 --> 08:53.500
I would never ask my
brother such a thing.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.500
Mm-hmm.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.000
And he would never...

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
(sighs)

09:00.810 --> 09:03.480
He would never... what?

09:09.480 --> 09:11.480
(cell phone clatters)

09:11.480 --> 09:15.080
(low hum of chat)

09:15.080 --> 09:17.480
(door opens)

09:18.480 --> 09:20.480
(James exhales deeply)

09:21.630 --> 09:23.260
Good morning.

09:23.260 --> 09:25.330
Hey.

09:25.330 --> 09:27.270
(smooches)

09:27.270 --> 09:29.940
(utensils click in background)
Have you been smoking?

09:29.940 --> 09:32.140
(sighs)

09:32.140 --> 09:33.810
Did you get word
 from Sammy?

09:33.810 --> 09:35.810
Uh, yeah, I did.

09:35.810 --> 09:39.780
He's still in Ma'an,
staying in Ma'an.

09:39.780 --> 09:42.850
He's decided to fight
with the resistance.

09:44.790 --> 09:47.290
That's crazy.

09:47.290 --> 09:49.390
You must be
out of your mind with worry.

09:49.390 --> 09:51.160
Why didn't you wake me?

09:51.160 --> 09:52.390
No, it's fine.
 I'm fine.

09:52.390 --> 09:53.630
I'm...

09:53.630 --> 09:55.390
I'm calling
the State Department.

09:55.400 --> 09:56.400
They can't do anything.

09:56.400 --> 09:57.660
They won't do anything.

09:57.670 --> 10:00.230
They can't do anything,
 James.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.960
Besides, I think
you should pack.

10:07.540 --> 10:09.580
You're not serious.

10:09.580 --> 10:11.580
W... We're not...
We're not actually leaving?

10:11.580 --> 10:13.480
No, not me.

10:13.480 --> 10:16.010
But I think you should.

10:16.020 --> 10:17.380
No.

10:17.390 --> 10:18.980
I mean,
not if you're still here.

10:18.990 --> 10:20.750
Not if Sammy's
 still here.

10:20.760 --> 10:22.990
Look, I need to be here
as long as it takes.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.390
Okay, I do, too, then.

10:24.390 --> 10:25.990
That's the thing,
 you don't.

10:25.990 --> 10:28.490
You don't.

10:28.500 --> 10:30.600
(sighs)

10:30.600 --> 10:31.660
James,

10:31.670 --> 10:33.730
I'm sorry.

10:36.340 --> 10:38.400
You're not family.

10:42.610 --> 10:44.410
I think you're amazing.

10:44.410 --> 10:48.580
I'm beyond grateful for
everything you've done for me.

10:48.580 --> 10:51.220
But right now, there's just
no room left in my brain

10:51.220 --> 10:53.350
for anything but waiting
for my son to come back

10:53.350 --> 10:54.720
so I can take him home.

10:54.720 --> 10:57.190
And you don't want me
to stick around?

10:59.130 --> 11:01.130
Keep you company?

11:01.130 --> 11:02.660
I'm sorry.

11:04.630 --> 11:07.370
You know you're not
making any sense.

11:07.370 --> 11:11.370
Well, I'm making 
sense to me.

11:11.370 --> 11:13.640
(sighs)

11:13.640 --> 11:16.710
If you're trying to get
rid of me, this is not the way.

11:16.710 --> 11:18.940
- I'll call you every day.
- No.

11:18.950 --> 11:22.150
Text, e-mail, carrier pigeon.

11:22.150 --> 11:24.220
Please don't.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.890
I really like you.

11:33.060 --> 11:35.530
Maybe you should stop.

11:39.670 --> 11:41.500
Okay.

11:45.140 --> 11:48.210
I guess I'm going back
to my room to pack.

11:50.210 --> 11:53.210
(utensils clinking)

11:59.210 --> 12:03.210
(traffic noise in distance)

12:03.210 --> 12:05.210
(entrance door closes)

12:56.950 --> 13:01.550
Tyrant S02E09
"Inside Men and Outside Women"

13:02.650 --> 13:10.950
Sync and corrected by
Gianluca Belfiglio

13:17.830 --> 13:19.400
So you haven't heard
 anything?

13:19.400 --> 13:21.570
Well, I... I don't even know
if he's made the call yet.

13:21.570 --> 13:23.500
This is ridiculous.

13:23.500 --> 13:26.040
Every hour is precious.

13:26.040 --> 13:28.040
That sandstorm is
going to come and go.

13:28.040 --> 13:30.780
And once it is gone,
we have lost our window.

13:30.780 --> 13:34.450
I need a way to reach out
to Khalil directly.

13:34.450 --> 13:36.880
I know you have
 his number.

13:36.880 --> 13:39.020
You need to give it to me.

13:39.020 --> 13:42.090
Gentlemen...

13:42.090 --> 13:45.890
I work at the pleasure
of President Al Fayeed.

13:45.890 --> 13:48.260
If I defy him,
that is an act of treason.

13:48.260 --> 13:49.960
It is not an act of treason

13:49.960 --> 13:51.860
to want to protect
one's country.

13:51.870 --> 13:54.800
No, let... (pats on table)
let me try and find out

13:54.800 --> 13:58.800
if he has connected
with Khalil, hmm?

13:58.810 --> 14:03.080
And as far as you
dealing with him directly...

14:03.080 --> 14:06.850
my advice would be to save
that discussion for another day.

14:08.820 --> 14:10.880
(Halima) Yesterday, you told us
you were talking to the Palace,

14:10.880 --> 14:13.120
hatching a plan to take our
city back from the Caliphate.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.890
So what is the plan?
(others murmuring, repeating the question)

14:14.890 --> 14:16.660
(Barry) I understand
your frustration.

14:16.660 --> 14:19.660
It has been difficult
to get to the right people.

14:19.660 --> 14:23.000
But I have faith,
 every faith

14:23.000 --> 14:24.930
that it will all
come together soon.

14:24.930 --> 14:26.300
Okay?

14:26.300 --> 14:29.300
(birds chirping)

14:29.900 --> 14:32.400
Okay. Let's get back
 to work.

14:32.400 --> 14:36.400
(murmuring resumes)
(indistinct chattering)

14:40.800 --> 14:45.800
(indistinct chattering continues)

14:47.020 --> 14:49.090
Mr. Al Fayeed.

14:51.030 --> 14:54.490
Sammy is fine.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.860
Let me show you around.

15:08.460 --> 15:10.860
(Sammy sighs heavily)

15:10.860 --> 15:12.960
(footsteps approaching)

15:15.860 --> 15:18.160
(Barry sighs)

15:22.560 --> 15:25.290
(sighs)

15:25.290 --> 15:27.360
Okay, okay.

15:30.730 --> 15:33.730
(Barry breaths deeply)

15:33.730 --> 15:36.540
(sighs)

15:36.540 --> 15:38.640
You called Mom?

15:38.640 --> 15:40.410
Yeah, of course.
 I had to.

15:40.410 --> 15:42.970
I needed her
 to... (breaths deeply)

15:42.980 --> 15:46.650
to know that you were here,
know you were... safe

15:46.650 --> 15:49.150
and that I'd do everything
I could to keep you safe.

15:49.150 --> 15:51.720
Wow.

15:51.720 --> 15:53.820
Almost sounds
 like you care.

15:53.820 --> 15:55.890
(clears throat)

15:57.860 --> 15:59.220
I'll be honest with you.

15:59.230 --> 16:02.660
I don't know where
to be right now.

16:02.660 --> 16:05.930
She sounded
 so... scared.

16:05.930 --> 16:07.830
Confused.

16:07.840 --> 16:09.430
Lonely.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.400
She's a mess.

16:12.410 --> 16:15.010
So part of me
 wants to

16:15.010 --> 16:18.240
run back to her
and make her feel okay, but...

16:18.250 --> 16:20.410
that's really your job,
isn't it?

16:24.120 --> 16:26.180
I don't know
where you should be either.

16:28.120 --> 16:29.690
I hate that you're here.

16:29.690 --> 16:33.630
It terrifies me, 
but... (sniffs)

16:33.630 --> 16:36.190
but I'm also very proud.

16:36.200 --> 16:38.700
Don't be.

16:38.700 --> 16:40.970
It has absolutely nothing
to do with you.

16:44.610 --> 16:46.610
Anything else, or, uh...

16:46.610 --> 16:49.780
are we all caught up now?

16:49.780 --> 16:51.710
(muezzin sounds call to prayer)

16:51.710 --> 16:53.480
That's the call to prayer.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.550
I know what it is.

16:59.250 --> 17:00.950
Join me.

17:00.950 --> 17:02.950
We'll wash and pray.

17:02.960 --> 17:04.560
I'll show you how.

17:07.290 --> 17:09.660
What's up with you
 and Mom?

17:09.660 --> 17:11.900
When we were kids,
everybody else was,

17:11.900 --> 17:13.670
you know, celebrating
Easter and Christmas.

17:13.670 --> 17:15.500
We couldn't get you
guys near a church.

17:15.500 --> 17:19.500
Now, all of a sudden,
you two are holy rollers?

17:19.510 --> 17:22.839
Mom I get, you know.
She lost a husband. But you?

17:22.839 --> 17:26.010
Sammy, so much has...
(call to prayer continues)

17:26.010 --> 17:27.910
I'm sorry.
(call to prayer continues)

17:27.920 --> 17:29.680
I... I wasn't sure
 you heard.

17:29.680 --> 17:33.250
No, I was just, um,
inviting Samuel to join us.

17:33.250 --> 17:35.250
I was just
 politely declining.

17:35.260 --> 17:36.860
If you'll excuse me.

17:41.860 --> 17:43.930
(chanting in Arabic)

17:49.670 --> 17:51.740
(phone vibrating)

17:56.980 --> 17:59.040
(phone continues vibrating)

18:02.690 --> 18:04.690
(phone beeps)

18:04.690 --> 18:05.880
Hello?

18:05.890 --> 18:07.450
(Jamal) So...

18:07.450 --> 18:11.320
how is my favorite
counterrevolutionary?

18:11.330 --> 18:12.890
Anxious.

18:12.890 --> 18:14.660
I'm glad you called.

18:14.660 --> 18:17.130
I'd love to get on the phone
with your head of military

18:17.130 --> 18:18.900
and start making
some concrete plans.

18:18.900 --> 18:20.870
Ah. General Said.

18:20.870 --> 18:24.570
Well, I'm not so sure
 about him.

18:24.570 --> 18:26.470
I will tell you a secret.

18:26.470 --> 18:27.740
He is my son.

18:27.740 --> 18:31.080
Imagine that.

18:31.080 --> 18:34.250
A child I never knew
 I had.

18:34.250 --> 18:36.480
I was so excited.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.750
So proud.

18:38.750 --> 18:42.350
He is a man
of great accomplishments.

18:42.360 --> 18:44.690
Uh, then, um...

18:44.690 --> 18:46.930
then what is it
that's giving you pause?

18:46.930 --> 18:50.560
Well, I went
to see a learned man

18:50.560 --> 18:53.570
about why 
God is punishing me.

18:53.570 --> 18:57.040
Wait, you think
that God is punishing you?

18:57.040 --> 18:58.370
Well...

18:58.370 --> 19:00.840
it feels like it.
(water dripping)

19:00.840 --> 19:02.570
(clears throat)
(water dripping)

19:02.580 --> 19:07.050
Maybe... Maybe because
I couldn't forgive my brother.

19:07.050 --> 19:10.180
(sighs) And no... 
no war can be won

19:10.180 --> 19:12.180
without the help of God.

19:12.190 --> 19:14.750
Mr. President,
as wise as you are,

19:14.760 --> 19:17.360
you cannot presume
to know what God is thinking.

19:17.360 --> 19:21.760
Well, it's not me presuming.

19:21.760 --> 19:25.030
The sheik told me

19:25.030 --> 19:28.070
there is a poison
inside the Palace.

19:28.070 --> 19:30.140
It could be anyone.

19:32.040 --> 19:34.970
(sighs) But you...

19:34.980 --> 19:37.940
I trust.

19:39.950 --> 19:42.880
(wind gusting)
(quietly) I don't understand it myself.

19:42.880 --> 19:45.220
(wind gusting)
I think you want to go to war or you don't.

19:45.220 --> 19:47.790
But when I look
into your father's eyes,

19:47.790 --> 19:50.160
I don't see either.

19:50.160 --> 19:51.760
There must be something
that we can do.

19:51.760 --> 19:52.990
I don't know.

19:52.990 --> 19:55.990
(birds chirping)

20:00.470 --> 20:02.800
Hafa, you can go
 to lunch now.

20:02.800 --> 20:04.140
Okay.

20:11.850 --> 20:14.180
Here's what 
we are considering.

20:14.180 --> 20:18.250
Uh, from the information I have,
three nights from now

20:18.250 --> 20:20.250
a sandstorm
is predicted in Ma'an,

20:20.250 --> 20:24.820
which creates great
offensive opportunity for us.

20:24.830 --> 20:26.990
Okay, what's your plan?

20:26.990 --> 20:28.690
We're still figuring it out.

20:28.700 --> 20:31.130
I just wanted to check
whether you

20:31.130 --> 20:35.700
and your people could take out
the antiaircraft battery

20:35.700 --> 20:38.640
at the Caliphate-controlled
army base.

20:38.640 --> 20:40.810
You want us to raid
an army base?

20:40.810 --> 20:42.710
Mr. President,

20:42.710 --> 20:45.310
I have no heavy artillery,
no explosives.

20:45.310 --> 20:47.110
Many of my fighters,
they're very young.

20:47.110 --> 20:49.480
That's a tall order
without professional support.

20:49.480 --> 20:52.620
As I said, we're just
still figuring it out.

20:52.620 --> 20:54.490
Um...

20:54.490 --> 20:57.720
Maybe we... we come up
with a different idea.

20:57.720 --> 21:01.460
Maybe for now,
we don't go to war at all.

21:01.460 --> 21:04.660
What if we just
 give it to them?

21:04.660 --> 21:06.300
Give what to who?

21:06.300 --> 21:08.500
Give Ma'an to the Caliphate.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.300
Think about it.

21:10.300 --> 21:12.900
Can we win such a war
at this time?

21:12.910 --> 21:17.310
Maybe we just
 let them have it.

21:17.310 --> 21:20.150
Mr. President, you can't just
let them have it.

21:20.150 --> 21:21.650
It's filled with people...
Your people,

21:21.650 --> 21:24.220
people who are counting on you,
counting on us.

21:25.320 --> 21:28.250
I like talking to you, Khalil.

21:28.260 --> 21:30.860
You are very passionate.

21:30.860 --> 21:32.560
You have a good heart.

21:32.560 --> 21:35.260
But let's talk about Ma'an.

21:35.260 --> 21:37.760
It's filled with people,
that's right.

21:37.760 --> 21:40.200
But who are they?

21:40.200 --> 21:41.500
The Rashids?

21:41.500 --> 21:43.940
They have always hated
the Al Fayeeds.

21:43.940 --> 21:47.940
And oil, which I grant you
is today's fuel,

21:47.940 --> 21:50.680
but not tomorrow's.

21:50.680 --> 21:53.550
Let's say it will cost

21:53.550 --> 21:56.580
$1 billion
 to wage this war,

21:56.580 --> 22:00.920
then another billion to rebuild
after we beat the Caliphate.

22:00.920 --> 22:04.390
Will we actually have
 $2 billion

22:04.390 --> 22:07.130
in value down the line?

22:07.130 --> 22:09.190
I'm not so sure
 about that.

22:09.200 --> 22:11.900
Forgive me, Khalil,
I have to go.

22:11.900 --> 22:13.130
No, sir, sir, please.

22:13.130 --> 22:15.130
Just let me sit down
with the general,

22:15.140 --> 22:17.140
with anyone inside
your military.

22:17.140 --> 22:18.700
We have to agree
 on a plan.

22:18.710 --> 22:20.310
Time is not on our side.

22:20.310 --> 22:22.810
Now, listen,
I will call again tomorrow.

22:22.810 --> 22:27.780
In the meantime,
please improve upon our plans.

22:28.750 --> 22:33.550
You are a warrior.

22:33.550 --> 22:36.620
I have great confidence
 in you.

22:37.620 --> 22:41.230
Sir, I am not a warr...
(line clicks, busy line sound)

22:43.330 --> 22:46.330
You look like your
world's ending.

22:46.330 --> 22:48.730
My world is ending.

22:48.740 --> 22:50.600
My world here, anyway.

22:50.600 --> 22:53.470
Can't decide if it's
a blessing or a curse.

22:55.410 --> 22:57.280
What do you mean?

22:57.280 --> 23:00.580
I'm being banished.

23:00.580 --> 23:02.350
To London.

23:02.350 --> 23:03.850
To Paris.

23:03.850 --> 23:06.420
A city of my choice.

23:06.420 --> 23:08.650
A single woman.

23:08.660 --> 23:11.660
It's my, uh,
in-laws' parting gift

23:11.660 --> 23:15.190
for not being able to produce
someone to carry on the legacy

23:15.200 --> 23:18.730
of this most
extraordinary family.

23:19.730 --> 23:21.730
(Rami scoffs)

23:23.270 --> 23:25.540
What about Ahmed?

23:25.540 --> 23:26.800
What about your husband?

23:26.810 --> 23:28.840
What happens to him?

23:28.840 --> 23:31.380
Ahmed stays here,

23:31.380 --> 23:35.180
nurses his, uh, broken heart
back to health,

23:35.180 --> 23:38.520
and with, uh, luck, finds
a loving, fertile partner.

23:41.450 --> 23:43.520
He's okay with this?

23:45.460 --> 23:48.460
No.

23:48.460 --> 23:50.530
And I'm not helping.

23:53.470 --> 23:56.530
Turns out, he's willing
to give up everything for me.

24:01.470 --> 24:03.470
And it's killing him

24:03.480 --> 24:06.540
that I'm not willing
to give up everything for him.

24:10.820 --> 24:13.820
(Ihab) Where is
the Red Hand Brigade?

24:13.820 --> 24:15.590
Hmm?

24:15.590 --> 24:17.590
Munir,
 where do they eat?

24:17.590 --> 24:18.890
Where do they sleep?

24:18.890 --> 24:21.160
Where do they hide?

24:24.340 --> 24:28.340
(footsteps approaching fast)

24:28.340 --> 24:30.400
(bag rustling)
(gasping)

24:31.400 --> 24:34.400
(muffled moaning)

24:36.440 --> 24:38.280
(grunting)

24:41.450 --> 24:43.280
(panting)

24:48.090 --> 24:51.420
So, I asked you a question.

24:51.420 --> 24:53.420
(Munir gasps)

24:53.420 --> 24:56.420
(panting)

24:56.420 --> 24:58.370
(sighing)

24:58.370 --> 25:01.370
(whimpering) I saved your life.

25:01.370 --> 25:03.370
(sniffles) That's all
I was trying to do, brother,

25:03.370 --> 25:04.540
is save your life.

25:04.540 --> 25:06.570
I'm trying to return the favor.

25:06.570 --> 25:08.470
Just tell them what
they need to know

25:08.480 --> 25:11.040
so they can spare
yours, Munir. Come on.

25:20.650 --> 25:22.570
(knocking on door)
(Leila) Not now.

25:24.790 --> 25:26.790
General Said is here.

25:26.790 --> 25:28.390
Tell him the president
is indisposed.

25:28.400 --> 25:31.330
Actually it's you
I'm looking for.

25:32.500 --> 25:34.500
(utensils clink)

25:34.500 --> 25:36.500
(hinges squeaking)

25:36.500 --> 25:39.060
Your father is a man
of great appetites.

25:41.440 --> 25:43.440
(sighs heavily) Sometimes
 I need to do what I can

25:43.440 --> 25:46.000
to help him 
reign himself in.

25:48.180 --> 25:50.480
Is he sleeping at all?

25:50.480 --> 25:53.480
It's hard to actually
call it sleep.

25:53.490 --> 25:56.050
I put him to bed.
He's not moving.

25:57.490 --> 26:01.130
As long as he doesn't change
color, I'm filled with hope.

26:01.130 --> 26:03.360
2:00 in the afternoon.

26:03.360 --> 26:06.360
Very presidential.

26:06.370 --> 26:10.440
What can I do
 for you, General?

26:10.440 --> 26:13.840
I need a phone number for
Khalil of the Red Hand Brigade.

26:13.840 --> 26:17.380
And what makes you think
I would have such a thing?

26:17.380 --> 26:19.640
I'm fairly sure you don't.

26:19.650 --> 26:22.050
But I'm also fairly sure
that you can get it.

26:22.050 --> 26:23.780
(Molly) <i>You know,
 I was so shocked</i>

26:23.780 --> 26:25.180
by your call
 the other day.

26:25.190 --> 26:27.190
My head was so spinning
with Sammy gone

26:27.190 --> 26:29.450
and being in a place I despise
and suddenly finding out

26:29.460 --> 26:31.990
this man that the whole world
is mourning

26:31.990 --> 26:34.560
and thinks of
as some kind of a saint,

26:34.560 --> 26:38.160
my husband, has been alive
all this time

26:38.160 --> 26:40.470
and didn't have the decency
to let me know.

26:43.670 --> 26:46.470
I forgot to tell you, Barry...

26:46.470 --> 26:49.470
how badly
 you've destroyed me,

26:49.480 --> 26:52.510
how badly
you've damaged our family (sniffles)

26:52.510 --> 26:54.580
and that you're
a horrible person.

26:54.580 --> 26:57.520
(car engine roars in distance)

26:57.520 --> 27:01.320
Since you called,
I've actually had moments

27:01.320 --> 27:04.320
where I found myself
wishing you <i> were</i> dead.

27:04.320 --> 27:05.590
Truly dead.

27:05.590 --> 27:07.330
Gone.

27:07.330 --> 27:08.930
You got that?

27:09.900 --> 27:12.260
Yeah, I got it.

27:12.270 --> 27:13.750
(man) <i>Fire!</i>

27:13.750 --> 27:15.750
(gunshot)
(bullet clangs, cuts through air)

27:15.750 --> 27:17.070
(stones clattering)

27:17.070 --> 27:20.070
- (man) Reload.
- You hold the gun like a girl.

27:20.070 --> 27:22.140
Give it to me.

27:27.080 --> 27:29.080
You hold the gun like a boy.

27:29.080 --> 27:31.620
Eh, I hold the gun
like someone who knows

27:31.620 --> 27:35.520
their life depends upon
holding it correctly.

27:35.520 --> 27:37.620
Why are you here?

27:37.620 --> 27:39.620
Weren't you just
going to give money?

27:39.630 --> 27:41.630
You have a problem
with me being here?

27:41.630 --> 27:44.360
No, I just find it
 interesting.

27:44.360 --> 27:46.360
This isn't even your home.

27:46.370 --> 27:48.630
I'm from here.

27:48.640 --> 27:51.640
Father was.

27:51.640 --> 27:53.140
And I thought
hating the Caliphate

27:53.140 --> 27:54.770
was the only requirement.

27:54.770 --> 27:56.770
(man) Get set.

28:02.720 --> 28:04.160
(man) Fire!

28:04.160 --> 28:06.160
(gunshot)

28:06.160 --> 28:08.160
(man) Reload!

28:08.160 --> 28:09.960
(laughs)

28:09.960 --> 28:12.490
I know what you're thinking.

28:12.490 --> 28:14.290
How did I make my bullet

28:14.290 --> 28:15.460
go through the exact

28:15.460 --> 28:18.470
- same hole that yours did?
- (man) Into positions.

28:18.470 --> 28:20.500
It's okay to laugh.

28:20.500 --> 28:22.970
Life's already 
awful enough.

28:24.970 --> 28:26.970
(man) Weapons ready!

28:29.510 --> 28:30.510
Fire!

28:30.510 --> 28:32.580
(water running)

28:33.750 --> 28:36.810
- (Jamal) Leila.
- (Leila clears throat)

28:37.750 --> 28:39.550
(water stops)

28:44.190 --> 28:46.260
What is it, Jamal?

28:47.630 --> 28:48.630
(sighs)

28:48.630 --> 28:50.660
I had a nightmare.

28:54.600 --> 28:55.870
I was in the ocean.

28:55.870 --> 28:58.370
Uh, I developed a cramp.

28:58.370 --> 29:03.110
I couldn't swim, couldn't keep
my head above water.

29:03.110 --> 29:06.540
And then the tide started
to carry me away.

29:06.550 --> 29:11.620
And you were standing
on the shore, watching.

29:11.620 --> 29:14.790
(sighs) And you wouldn't
jump in to save me.

29:14.790 --> 29:18.620
Just watching, as I was

29:18.630 --> 29:22.190
drawn deeper and deeper
into the ocean.

29:24.160 --> 29:26.930
- That's a ridiculous dream.
- Mmhhh...

29:27.470 --> 29:30.730
- (Jamal exhales deeply)
- You've been drinking too much.

29:32.170 --> 29:34.240
- Too many pills.
- (Jamal sighs heavily)

29:35.910 --> 29:37.410
You left this 
in the bathroom.

29:37.410 --> 29:38.480
Mmm.

29:41.920 --> 29:43.920
Look at me.

29:43.920 --> 29:46.020
You see me?

29:46.020 --> 29:47.920
Mmm.

29:47.920 --> 29:50.390
I'm here...

29:50.390 --> 29:53.420
to pull you out
 of the ocean.

29:53.430 --> 29:55.490
I will never let you drown.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.070
(sighs)

30:16.680 --> 30:18.750
(phone vibrating)

30:24.760 --> 30:26.260
Hello.

30:26.260 --> 30:27.790
(Rami) Khalil.

30:27.790 --> 30:29.630
This is General Rami Said.

30:32.800 --> 30:34.600
What can I do for you,
 General?

30:34.600 --> 30:37.400
I was hoping (sighs)
we could meet this evening,

30:37.400 --> 30:39.640
say, 8:30,
  face-to-face.

30:39.640 --> 30:42.640
I've arranged for a private home
five miles outside Ma'an.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.810
I'll send you the address.

30:50.810 --> 30:53.810
(chair rumbles)

31:03.810 --> 31:06.810
(scissors snipping)

31:11.740 --> 31:13.740
Brother, I...

31:13.740 --> 31:15.740
I know you're...
you're cold and hungry.

31:15.740 --> 31:18.740
I... I brought you food
 and water.

31:18.750 --> 31:22.310
All you have to do
is walk over to that map

31:22.320 --> 31:24.920
and show us
 the location

31:24.920 --> 31:26.650
of the Red Hand 
headquarters.

31:26.650 --> 31:27.750
That's it.

31:29.760 --> 31:31.490
But I do not know.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.590
How would I know?

31:33.590 --> 31:36.360
Munir, I beg of you.

31:36.360 --> 31:39.930
I've explained to everyone
that you have made a mistake,

31:39.930 --> 31:41.030
that you were tricked.

31:41.030 --> 31:42.700
Your... Your friends
in the Red Hand,

31:42.700 --> 31:44.840
they were
taking advantage of you.

31:44.840 --> 31:47.410
I have no friends
in the Red Hand.

31:50.780 --> 31:53.210
My only friend
 is you, Kasim.

31:56.150 --> 31:58.150
My brother.

31:58.150 --> 32:00.150
(sniffles)

32:00.150 --> 32:02.590
My big brother.

32:05.320 --> 32:07.830
Well, that was touching.

32:07.830 --> 32:10.130
(gun cocks)

32:10.130 --> 32:12.200
I'm going to count to three,

32:12.200 --> 32:14.700
then I'm going to shoot
your brother's nose off.

32:14.700 --> 32:16.200
If you still don't get up,

32:16.200 --> 32:19.640
walk over to that map,
I'm going to blow his ears off.

32:19.640 --> 32:21.640
And if, and if you still
do not move,

32:21.640 --> 32:23.140
I'm going to shoot out
 his eyes.

32:23.140 --> 32:25.210
- One.
- (Munir shivering)

32:25.210 --> 32:26.980
(sniffling)

32:26.980 --> 32:28.280
Two.

32:44.600 --> 32:46.660
(chattering)

32:46.660 --> 32:48.660
(man) Me too, please.

32:54.570 --> 32:56.570
What's going on?

32:56.580 --> 32:58.840
There's a rumor Khalil has
a meeting with the military

32:58.850 --> 33:02.950
to make war plans, that the
fight is about to begin.

33:02.950 --> 33:04.950
(pounding on table)

33:08.220 --> 33:11.860
(chanting) The Caliphate,
we will decimate.

33:11.860 --> 33:13.960
(all) The Caliphate,

33:13.960 --> 33:16.030
we will decimate.

33:16.030 --> 33:18.400
The Caliphate,
 we will decimate.

33:18.400 --> 33:20.630
The Caliphate,

33:20.630 --> 33:23.030
we will decimate!
(cheering, whooping)

33:23.040 --> 33:25.970
The Caliphate,
 we will decimate!

33:25.970 --> 33:28.070
(faster) The Caliphate,
we will decimate!

33:28.070 --> 33:33.810
The Caliphate,
 we will decimate!

33:33.810 --> 33:35.050
The Caliphate...

33:39.790 --> 33:43.920
I told you you didn't
have to come tonight.

33:43.920 --> 33:45.990
You've been through a lot.

33:45.990 --> 33:48.430
I'm fine. I understand.

33:48.430 --> 33:51.100
If he confessed, it would've...

33:51.100 --> 33:54.500
He was your brother.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.830
He was family.

33:56.840 --> 34:00.240
It couldn't have been easy
for you to watch him die.

34:01.910 --> 34:03.410
(Rami) Excellent.

34:03.410 --> 34:04.840
And we'll send you back
 tonight

34:04.840 --> 34:06.280
with enough goggles,
plastic explosives

34:06.280 --> 34:08.909
and munitions to do the job.

34:08.920 --> 34:12.020
Just remember,

34:12.020 --> 34:13.449
should you speak
with the president tomorrow,

34:13.449 --> 34:15.090
none of these conversations
have taken place.

34:15.090 --> 34:16.920
And, please,

34:16.920 --> 34:19.090
act impressed should he call
and share with you

34:19.090 --> 34:21.659
all the particulars we've
gone over with you tonight.

34:21.659 --> 34:23.830
I know
 it sounds crazy, but...

34:23.830 --> 34:25.900
I understand.

34:30.500 --> 34:32.570
(gun clicks)

34:40.280 --> 34:42.210
(phone chiming)
(Ru'a) Who is that?

34:42.219 --> 34:44.520
Your girlfriend?

34:44.520 --> 34:46.050
Not quite.

34:46.050 --> 34:48.050
Uh, it's my mother.

34:48.050 --> 34:50.889
Do you have a girlfriend?

34:52.790 --> 34:54.929
Is one required?

34:56.060 --> 34:57.460
- Let me see her picture. 
- No...

34:57.460 --> 34:58.900
Nah, there...
there is no picture,

34:58.900 --> 35:00.300
'cause, uh,
 there's no her.

35:00.300 --> 35:02.730
Is she prettier than me?

35:02.740 --> 35:03.900
(sighs)

35:03.900 --> 35:05.900
(explosion)
(clattering sound)

35:05.900 --> 35:08.810
(people screaming, crying)

35:10.910 --> 35:12.910
(booming)

35:12.910 --> 35:14.980
(gunfire in distance)

35:14.980 --> 35:16.750
(people shouting)

35:16.750 --> 35:18.820
(muffled shouting)

35:18.820 --> 35:20.750
(shooting)

35:20.750 --> 35:22.950
(ears ringing)

35:29.930 --> 35:32.100
(gunfire)
Hurry!

35:34.070 --> 35:37.130
(shouting, gunfire continues)

35:37.130 --> 35:41.130
(woman screaming)

35:41.130 --> 35:43.130
(fire whooshing)

35:43.130 --> 35:46.130
(gunshots)
(man gasps, body thuds)

35:48.130 --> 35:50.130
(woman sobbing and screaming)

35:50.130 --> 35:53.130
(rocket whistles)
(explosion and clattering)

35:53.130 --> 35:55.130
(shouting orders in local language)

35:56.130 --> 35:59.130
(panting)

36:02.130 --> 36:06.130
(gunfire continues in distance)

36:08.400 --> 36:10.270
Shoot her, Kasim.

36:11.600 --> 36:14.100
Shoot her! 
Shoot! Shoot her!

36:14.110 --> 36:16.310
What's wrong with you?

36:16.310 --> 36:17.940
(whimpers) What's wrong?

36:17.940 --> 36:20.610
What's wrong with you, Kasim?
What's wrong?

36:24.320 --> 36:26.880
I beg for
 God's forgiveness.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.880
(cocks gun)

36:29.820 --> 36:31.890
(shouting, gunfire continues)

36:31.890 --> 36:33.890
(bullets cut through air)

36:33.890 --> 36:36.890
(rocket whistles)

36:36.890 --> 36:39.230
(booming)
(ruins clattering)

36:39.230 --> 36:41.300
(coughing)

36:41.300 --> 36:43.300
(labored gasping)

37:05.590 --> 37:09.660
(gunfire, explosions continue)

37:10.460 --> 37:12.360
(phone chimes)

37:12.370 --> 37:14.200
Fourteen messages.

37:14.200 --> 37:15.630
What the hell's going on?

37:15.630 --> 37:17.700
(men shouting)

37:28.150 --> 37:30.210
(shouting fades)

37:30.210 --> 37:33.210
(panting softly)

37:40.530 --> 37:42.590
(panting continues)

37:45.970 --> 37:49.070
Is it over?

37:49.070 --> 37:51.240
I don't know.

37:51.240 --> 37:53.570
Sounds like it.

37:59.350 --> 38:01.350
Sh... Should
 we move?

38:01.350 --> 38:03.410
Not yet.

38:18.260 --> 38:20.100
Why'd you do that?

38:21.670 --> 38:24.940
Because I got tired of waiting
for you to do it.

38:28.540 --> 38:30.540
Wait here.

38:30.540 --> 38:32.440
(groans softly)

38:38.020 --> 38:39.620
(gunfire, men shouting)

38:40.450 --> 38:44.520
(gasping, whimpering)

38:56.300 --> 38:58.100
What is the problem?

38:58.100 --> 39:00.200
A thousand apologies,
Mr. President,

39:00.210 --> 39:02.210
but, uh, my man, uh...

39:02.210 --> 39:04.940
the one you asked me to
have follow General Said,

39:04.940 --> 39:07.110
he just phoned in.

39:07.110 --> 39:08.580
Apparently,

39:08.580 --> 39:10.310
General Said and Solomon

39:10.320 --> 39:13.380
traveled to the outskirts
of Ma'an this evening.

39:13.390 --> 39:16.220
He is meeting with
an armed group of men.

39:18.220 --> 39:20.290
"Armed group of men"?

39:20.290 --> 39:22.490
Who could that be?

39:28.300 --> 39:29.800
(line ringing)

39:29.800 --> 39:31.070
(Sammy recorded) This is Sam I Am.

39:31.070 --> 39:32.570
Leave a message if you can.

39:32.570 --> 39:33.970
(goats bleating)

39:33.970 --> 39:36.340
(line ringing)

39:36.340 --> 39:38.180
This is Sam I Am.
Leave a message...

39:38.180 --> 39:40.080
(phone beeps)

39:40.080 --> 39:42.980
(line ringing)

39:42.980 --> 39:45.350
This is Sam I Am.
Leave a message if you can.

39:45.350 --> 39:47.180
(goats bleating)

39:55.430 --> 39:57.230
General Said!

40:01.270 --> 40:02.600
We know
 where you were.

40:02.600 --> 40:05.040
We know
 what you were doing.

40:05.040 --> 40:07.100
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

40:09.680 --> 40:12.340
Where was I and
what was I doing?

40:12.340 --> 40:14.780
I ask the questions.

40:14.780 --> 40:18.280
You drove
to the outskirts of Ma'an.

40:18.280 --> 40:20.350
Who did you meet with?

40:20.350 --> 40:21.850
The Caliphate?

40:21.850 --> 40:24.790
No, Mr. President.

40:24.790 --> 40:28.460
I would not and did not
meet with the Caliphate.

40:30.400 --> 40:32.200
Are you intoxicated?

40:32.200 --> 40:34.000
Um...

40:34.000 --> 40:36.330
I'm not intoxicated.

40:36.340 --> 40:39.240
And you are being
 insubordinate.

40:39.240 --> 40:43.070
In addition to possibly
being a traitor,

40:43.080 --> 40:45.480
who conspires
against his country.

40:45.480 --> 40:47.410
(Solomon) Actually, no.

40:47.410 --> 40:50.310
He is a patriot trying to
conspire with your allies,

40:50.320 --> 40:52.420
so maybe, just maybe,

40:52.420 --> 40:54.690
you might be able to
hold on to your country.

40:54.690 --> 40:58.390
You <i> were</i> meeting
with the Red Hand.

40:58.390 --> 41:00.390
Making plans
to retake Ma'an for you.

41:00.390 --> 41:01.890
Day after tomorrow.

41:01.890 --> 41:03.430
Just as we discussed.

41:03.430 --> 41:04.900
(scoffs)

41:04.900 --> 41:06.830
You met with Khalil

41:06.830 --> 41:10.270
after I explicitly
ordered you not to.

41:10.270 --> 41:12.070
You defied me.

41:12.070 --> 41:14.500
Yes, I defied you,
and you should thank me for it,

41:14.510 --> 41:16.440
because this nation
is hanging on by a thread.

41:16.440 --> 41:18.280
And all you can do
 is talk about

41:18.280 --> 41:19.840
who ordered what
and who defied who.

41:19.850 --> 41:23.180
For God's sake, you old
drunken fool, stand down.

41:24.450 --> 41:26.450
Let me do my job, 
and maybe,

41:26.450 --> 41:28.450
just maybe,
I'll be able to save yours.

41:29.360 --> 41:32.260
"Drunken, old fool."

41:32.260 --> 41:35.260
This is how you call
your president?

41:37.960 --> 41:41.430
This is how you speak
to your father?

41:45.540 --> 41:47.140
I'm sorry, Father.

41:49.070 --> 41:51.910
I seem to have lost your trust
somewhere along the way,

41:51.910 --> 41:54.440
but I swear to you
on the soul of my dead mother

41:54.450 --> 41:56.410
that I am on your side.

41:56.420 --> 41:58.150
I am your blood.

41:59.790 --> 42:02.550
You are the reason
 I am here.

42:04.490 --> 42:07.160
Just let me do this for you.
It's going to work.

42:07.160 --> 42:09.760
Just stop thwarting me and...

42:09.760 --> 42:11.330
let me do this.

42:15.770 --> 42:18.400
Fine.

42:18.400 --> 42:21.570
The day after tomorrow.

42:21.570 --> 42:24.040
Rain hell on
 the Caliphate.

42:29.450 --> 42:31.110
(clears throat)

42:31.120 --> 42:33.180
Uh...

42:37.520 --> 42:39.360
I want him dead.

42:48.130 --> 42:50.200
Sammy!

42:55.710 --> 42:59.040
Oh, my God. Sammy.

42:59.040 --> 43:01.480
Sammy! Sammy!

43:01.480 --> 43:03.550
(phone vibrating)

43:07.520 --> 43:09.620
Molly. 
Oh, my God, Molly!

43:09.620 --> 43:11.820
I don't know where he is!
I don't know where he is!

43:11.820 --> 43:13.560
He called me, Barry.

43:13.560 --> 43:15.490
About 20 minutes ago.

43:15.490 --> 43:18.360
He's hiding
with some other fighters.

43:18.360 --> 43:20.630
He's okay. He's okay.

43:20.630 --> 43:22.670
Cuts, bruises... (sniffles)

43:22.670 --> 43:24.670
in a state of shock,
but he's alive.

43:24.670 --> 43:26.470
Talking about
how he wants to go back.

43:26.470 --> 43:29.370
He wants to...
 see it through.

43:29.380 --> 43:31.580
He wants to go back
and fight with you.

43:31.580 --> 43:33.840
(voice breaking) And
 to be honest with you,

43:33.850 --> 43:36.250
I don't know what to do.

43:38.820 --> 43:41.320
But I wanted you
to know he's alive.

43:43.260 --> 43:47.060
We're all still alive.

43:47.060 --> 43:49.130
All of us.

43:51.060 --> 43:53.130
And just so you know...

43:55.600 --> 43:58.400
I'm glad you're still alive.

44:01.100 --> 44:03.100
(sighs)
