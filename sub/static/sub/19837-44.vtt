00:18.430 --> 00:22.760
<b>We're bodyguards for

00:23.960 --> 00:25.460
<b>I see.</b>

00:25.780 --> 00:28.460
<b>It seems that you can use <i>Nen</i>,</b>

<b>but don't bother.</b>

00:30.670 --> 00:33.470
<b>These aren't ordinary thugs.</b>

00:33.810 --> 00:36.720
<b>To them, taking lives is like breathing.</b>

00:37.080 --> 00:40.520
<b>Y-You could say they're

<b>Not one of them put up much of a fight.</b>

<b>Uvo!</b>

03:06.830 --> 03:07.790
<b>Yeah?</b>

03:08.110 --> 03:09.110

<b>Where did you hide the merchandise?</b>

<b>What happened to all the

04:09.100 --> 04:10.620

04:14.770 --> 04:16.610
<b>If you don't answer me...</b>

<b>I've never seen a <i>Nen</i> user

<b>A spider tattoo.</b>

<b>Spider...</b>

<b>Poor chap.

<b>He's just throwing a straight right,

07:18.980 --> 07:20.710
<b>The Phantom Troupe, huh?</b>

07:21.210 --> 07:23.480
<b>He sounds pretty confident.</b>

<b>You're the one who will die next!</b>

<b>Fool.</b>

<b>Nice...</b>

<b>I can even turn it into hard spikes, yup.</b>

<b>You throw a strong punch,</b>

<b>Uvogin's iron skin with nothing

<b>Did it finally kick in?</b>

09:05.100 --> 09:07.240
<b>My fangs secrete a tranquilizer</b>

<b>that's meant to instantly incapacitate you...</b>

<b>Bastard...</b>

09:14.580 --> 09:16.600
<b>Everything from the neck up is unaffected,</b>

<b>If he were using a lethal poison,

<b>and deposit their eggs in your bladder.</b>

09:45.730 --> 09:49.730
<b>These spotted leeches are

<b>of hundreds of millions of leeches</b>

10:15.010 --> 10:16.200
<b>Yuck.</b>

10:16.200 --> 10:19.630
<b>I thought that uglier usually

10:22.580 --> 10:24.240
<b>Why are you surprised?</b>

10:24.240 --> 10:26.980
<b>You aren't the only one

<b>Defeat us?</b>

11:16.700 --> 11:17.610
<b>Heh.</b>

11:18.290 --> 11:23.090
<b>You can't bite me when I'm

<b><i>He's going to do the same to me?</i></b>

12:02.460 --> 12:04.030
<b><i>But it won't work...</i></b>

12:04.520 --> 12:08.040
<b><i>My body hair will repel

12:10.300 --> 12:11.160
<b>Huh?</b>

12:48.790 --> 12:51.220
<b>You can't repel sound projectiles, can you?</b>

12:51.220 --> 12:52.910
<b>Oh, you can't hear me anymore?</b>

12:58.720 --> 13:01.800
<b>He used sound to defeat

13:02.240 --> 13:04.800
<b>They're all crazy...</b>

13:08.110 --> 13:09.560
<b>You idiot!</b>

13:09.920 --> 13:12.040
<b>Give us a warning first!</b>

13:12.040 --> 13:14.330
<b>What if our eardrums had burst?</b>

13:14.330 --> 13:15.810
<b>Sorry about that!</b>

13:15.810 --> 13:18.890
<b>But that would've given my plan away.</b>

13:18.890 --> 13:22.680
<b>Besides, you guys had plenty 
of time to cover your ears</b>

13:22.680 --> 13:24.910
<b>before the sound reached you.</b>

13:24.910 --> 13:26.240
<b>That's true.</b>

13:31.650 --> 13:32.950
<b>Wait, Kurapika!</b>

13:32.950 --> 13:34.390
<b>What are you doing?</b>

13:34.390 --> 13:36.220
<b>Shouldn't that be obvious?</b>

13:36.220 --> 13:37.620
<b>I'm going to capture him.</b>

13:38.640 --> 13:39.610
<b>It's impossible!</b>

13:39.610 --> 13:41.780
<b>You saw what he's capable of!</b>

13:41.780 --> 13:43.850
<b>You're going to get yourself killed!</b>

13:43.850 --> 13:45.090
<b>Kurapika!</b>

13:47.030 --> 13:48.390
<b>I really don't care.</b>

13:56.420 --> 13:59.700
<b><i>I hear tremendous rage and hatred.</i></b>

14:01.640 --> 14:04.290
<b><i>He's completely lost control.</i></b>

14:07.110 --> 14:08.610
<b>Kurapika!</b>

14:09.310 --> 14:12.620
<b><i>He will definitely get himself killed.</i></b>

14:13.090 --> 14:15.120
<b><i>I cannot leave him in this state.</i></b>

14:15.680 --> 14:17.120
<b>Stop, Kurapika!</b>

15:29.050 --> 15:30.480
<b>Wild Flower.</b>

15:30.480 --> 15:32.870
<b>The perfect song to relax you.</b>

15:33.170 --> 15:35.740
<b>Has everyone calmed down?</b>

15:35.740 --> 15:37.620
<b>Let's cool our heads,</b>

15:37.620 --> 15:39.340
<b>and devise a plan together.</b>

15:41.090 --> 15:42.620
<b>Y-Yeah...</b>

15:43.140 --> 15:46.770
<b>What kind of abilities do the 
other members possess?</b>

15:46.770 --> 15:50.080
<b>I bet they're all ridiculously strong...</b>

15:50.760 --> 15:51.900
<b>Melody...</b>

15:51.900 --> 15:52.630
<b>Hmm?</b>

15:54.120 --> 15:55.500
<b>Thank you.</b>

15:55.500 --> 15:56.890
<b>I've cooled down now.</b>

15:58.250 --> 16:00.160
<b>However, I still must capture them.</b>

16:01.610 --> 16:02.610
<b>Leader,</b>

16:04.270 --> 16:05.490
<b>I can make this happen.</b>

16:06.500 --> 16:07.650
<b>What?</b>

16:09.270 --> 16:10.580
<b>Let me go.</b>

16:11.950 --> 16:14.660
<b>After witnessing that 
incredible show of strength,</b>

16:14.660 --> 16:17.110
<b>you still believe you can defeat him?</b>

16:18.350 --> 16:19.660
<b>Of course.</b>

16:20.870 --> 16:21.970
<b>I understand.</b>

16:25.150 --> 16:28.240
<b>Bring the car, so we can 
leave at a moment's notice.</b>

16:28.240 --> 16:29.050
<b>R-Right.</b>

16:33.880 --> 16:35.350
<b>Shizuku!</b>

16:35.350 --> 16:39.190
<b>Would you suck the poison and 
leeches from my body?</b>

16:39.190 --> 16:41.410
<b>Your vacuum will do the trick.</b>

16:41.410 --> 16:45.200
<b>Blinky can suck out poison, 
but nothing alive.</b>

16:45.200 --> 16:46.310
<b>What?</b>

16:46.700 --> 16:48.380
<b>Then what am I supposed to do?</b>

16:50.550 --> 16:51.860
<b>Let me see.</b>

16:54.260 --> 16:56.810
<b>This is a spotted leech...</b>

16:56.810 --> 16:59.750
<b>It takes one day to migrate to the bladder,</b>

16:59.750 --> 17:01.950
<b>before laying its eggs and dying.</b>

17:01.950 --> 17:03.650
<b>So?</b>

17:03.650 --> 17:07.680
<b>The eggs will hatch shortly after, 
exiting through your urinary tract.</b>

17:07.680 --> 17:10.320
<b>It will cause enough pain to kill you.</b>

17:10.320 --> 17:12.210
<b>Hey, don't joke around...</b>

17:12.950 --> 17:17.740
<b>However, they require a specific 
ammonia level to hatch.</b>

17:17.740 --> 17:19.340
<b>If there isn't enough,</b>

17:19.340 --> 17:22.220
<b>the eggs don't hatch, and they 
can be excreted harmlessly.</b>

17:23.220 --> 17:25.940
<b>So, until this time tomorrow,</b>

17:25.940 --> 17:29.710
<b>you should drink beer non-stop, 
and be sure to urinate frequently!</b>

17:30.480 --> 17:32.850
<b>Don't scare me like that...</b>

17:33.390 --> 17:36.010
<b>Shizuku, can you take care of the poison?</b>

17:36.010 --> 17:36.990
<b>Yes.</b>

17:37.560 --> 17:40.780
<b>Someone go to the city 
and get lots of beer.</b>

17:40.780 --> 17:41.990
<b>I'll go.</b>

17:42.250 --> 17:44.540
<b>Make sure they're ice-cold!</b>

17:45.120 --> 17:46.870
<b>Don't get too greedy!</b>

17:52.050 --> 17:54.430
<b>Okay, get that poison out of me.</b>

18:00.390 --> 18:01.130
<b>Huh?</b>

18:16.040 --> 18:17.030
<b>Did you see that?</b>

18:17.030 --> 18:18.150
<b>Yeah.</b>

18:18.150 --> 18:21.330
<b>Those chains came from nowhere, 
to wrap around his body.</b>

18:21.620 --> 18:23.360
<b>Is it a new Shadow Beast?</b>

18:23.880 --> 18:26.240
<b>Uvo can't move because of the tranquilizer,</b>

18:26.240 --> 18:28.570
<b>and the leeches are still inside him.</b>

18:29.290 --> 18:31.840
<b>Then that's that... 
Let's go and save him.</b>

18:32.190 --> 18:33.330
<b>Good grief.</b>

18:33.330 --> 18:34.770
<b>He's so much trouble.</b>

18:35.330 --> 18:37.340
<b>I have a trace for now.</b>

18:38.340 --> 18:40.720
<b>I used <i>In</i> to conceal the thread.</b>

18:41.060 --> 18:44.980
<b>So as long as they don't use 
<i>Gyo</i> to spot the needle,</b>

18:45.550 --> 18:47.850
<b>I can follow them anywhere.</b>

18:48.390 --> 18:51.100
<b>Okay, let's find them 
before they notice it.</b>

18:52.210 --> 18:55.360
<b>This is our chance to finish the 
remaining Shadow Beasts.</b>

18:55.720 --> 18:58.420
<b>Franklin, we're counting on you 
to bring back lots of beer.</b>

18:58.420 --> 19:01.500
<b>Man, the chase sounds more fun...</b>

19:03.420 --> 19:04.370
<b>Let's go!</b>

19:06.080 --> 19:06.870
<b>Indeed.</b>

19:08.520 --> 19:10.010
<b>The spiders...</b>

19:12.350 --> 19:16.880
<b>We'd need all the remaining members</b>

19:16.880 --> 19:19.530
<b>just to stand a chance...</b>

19:30.920 --> 19:32.310
<b>Understood.</b>

19:38.460 --> 19:39.590
<b>Chains...</b>

19:47.840 --> 19:49.460
<b>Hey, driver...</b>

19:49.850 --> 19:52.940
<b>You think these chains can hold me?</b>

19:54.800 --> 19:58.300
