 ANYTHING YOU WANT.

00:30.100 --> 00:31.467
THAT'S THE ONE.

00:42.701 --> 00:44.834
 COME ON,
  LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.

00:44.934 --> 00:45.968
 WHATEVER'S GOING ON,

00:46.067 --> 00:47.467
 THE PLACE IS CREEPING
 ME OUT BIG TIME.

00:47.567 --> 00:50.200
 GOD, I KNEW THIS JOB
WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.467
BABY...

00:51.567 --> 00:53.601
THERE YOU ARE.

00:53.701 --> 00:54.334
 HI.

00:54.434 --> 00:55.467
UM...

00:55.567 --> 00:56.567
BRITTANY?

00:56.667 --> 00:57.734
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:57.834 --> 01:02.200
  I FINALLY MET THE
  MAN OF MY DREAMS.

01:02.300 --> 01:04.200
HUH...

01:04.300 --> 01:06.033
 THEY GOT TO YOU
TOO, DIDN'T THEY?

01:06.133 --> 01:08.734
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT
  YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:11.701 --> 01:13.367
 <sigh>

01:33.834 --> 01:35.234
  SHAL, COME ON.
 WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:35.334 --> 01:36.434
THE MOVIE STARTS
 IN AN HOUR.

01:36.534 --> 01:37.667
 WE'RE GOING TO MISS
THE PREVIEWS - AGAIN.

01:37.767 --> 01:38.934
 WOULD YOU KEEP
 YOUR PANTS ON?

01:39.033 --> 01:40.334
 WE HAVE
 PLENTY OF TIME.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.300
WHAT?

01:41.400 --> 01:42.567
OR BETTER YET, TAKE THOSE OFF.

01:42.667 --> 01:43.667
YOU AIN'T READY.

01:43.767 --> 01:44.567
COME ON...

01:44.667 --> 01:46.501
<ringing>
COME ON, VOICE MAIL...

01:46.601 --> 01:47.501
HOLD ON, HOLD ON,
HOLD ON.

01:47.601 --> 01:49.000
  VOICE MAIL.
  VOICE MAIL.

01:49.100 --> 01:50.434
YEAH?

01:50.534 --> 01:52.300
SHALIMAR,
 IT'S ME, GIA.

01:53.567 --> 01:54.734
GIA.

01:54.834 --> 01:57.133
I DIDN'T KNOW WHO ELSE TO
TURN TO - YOU GOTTA HELP ME.

01:57.234 --> 01:58.501
  LOOK, GIA, I TOLD
YOU LAST TIME,

01:58.601 --> 02:00.267
  YOU GOTTA CHECK
 YOURSELF INTO REHAB.

02:00.367 --> 02:01.467
 <i>SHALIMAR, I'M STRAIGHT.</i>

02:01.567 --> 02:02.634
I SWEAR.

02:02.734 --> 02:04.167
  WELL, THEN,
 WHAT'S WRONG?

02:04.267 --> 02:05.534
 I CAN'T TALK
 ABOUT IT HERE.

02:05.634 --> 02:06.601
COULD YOU
 JUST MEET ME?

02:06.701 --> 02:07.834
 I'M AT THE --

02:07.934 --> 02:09.300
 MEET YOU WHERE?

02:09.400 --> 02:11.067
GIA?

02:12.501 --> 02:13.934
  COME ON, GIA.

02:14.033 --> 02:16.567
 YOU GOT A NEW FRIEND
WHO'S DYING TO MEET YOU.

02:18.868 --> 02:20.267
I'M OUTTA HERE.

02:21.868 --> 02:23.167
UHH.

02:24.701 --> 02:26.267
 UHH.

02:27.901 --> 02:29.701
TAKE HER DOWNSTAIRS.

02:34.367 --> 02:35.267
THAT'S WEIRD.

02:35.367 --> 02:36.534
WHY WOULD SHE JUST
HANG UP LIKE THAT?

02:36.634 --> 02:38.667
 WELL, MAYBE HER DEALER
 FINALLY CAME THROUGH.

02:38.767 --> 02:40.267
COME ON, BRENNAN,
 YOU HEARD HER.

02:40.367 --> 02:41.667
SHE SOUNDED
REALLY FREAKED OUT.

02:41.767 --> 02:43.367
SHAL, HOW MANY TIMES ARE
 YOU GOING TO LET HER

02:43.467 --> 02:44.767
DRAG YOU DOWN THIS ROAD?

02:44.868 --> 02:46.167
  I KNOW FERALS ARE
 TIGHT, BUT...

02:46.267 --> 02:47.300
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

02:47.400 --> 02:48.300
WELL, IF IT'S IMPORTANT,

02:48.400 --> 02:49.567
 SHE'S GOING TO
 CALL BACK, RIGHT?

02:49.667 --> 02:50.601
COME ON, MOVIES.

02:50.701 --> 02:52.868
  MOVIES. PREVIEWS.
  COME ON!

02:52.968 --> 02:54.367
I GUESS SO.

02:54.467 --> 02:56.434
COME ON!

02:57.467 --> 02:58.701
 <i>THIS ONE'S SPECIAL.</i>

02:58.801 --> 03:00.868
   <i>SHE PUT UP QUITE
  <i>THE FIGHT.</i></i>

03:00.968 --> 03:02.701
 WAIT A MINUTE.
I THINK MAYBE WE...

03:02.801 --> 03:03.934
YOU KNOW, THIS...

03:04.067 --> 03:05.367
 I'M NOT FEELING
GOOD ABOUT THIS,

03:05.467 --> 03:06.367
MAYBE WE SHOULD WAIT.

03:06.467 --> 03:07.767
 DON'T BE SUCH A COWARD.

03:07.868 --> 03:10.033
 SHE'S ALREADY PAID FOR.

03:13.834 --> 03:15.801
 START THE PROCEDURE.

03:36.167 --> 03:40.133
   <i>SCIENTIST ADAM KANE WAS A
  <i>PIONEER OF GENETIC RESEARCH.</i></i>

03:40.234 --> 03:44.868
  <i>MANIPULATING DNA TO
   <i>SAVE HUMAN LIVES.</i></i>

03:44.968 --> 03:48.234
 <i>BUT IN MANY THEIR GENES
  <i>UNEXPECTEDLY MUTATED</i></i>

03:48.334 --> 03:51.400
   <i>AND THEY DEVELOPED
  <i>SUPERHUMAN ABILITIES.</i></i>

04:20.733 --> 04:23.267
  <i>TOGETHER, FOUR OF THE
  <i>MOST POWERFUL FIGHT</i></i>

04:23.367 --> 04:26.634
 <i>TO PROTECT A WORLD THAT
  <i>DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THEY EXIST.</i></i>

04:29.100 --> 04:32.834
  <i>THEY ARE... MUTANT X.</i>

04:37.968 --> 04:40.300
 SLOW NIGHT AT
  SANCTUARY, IS IT?

04:42.133 --> 04:44.033
 <SIGHS>

04:45.501 --> 04:46.834
 DO YOU WANT
SOMETHING, JESS?

04:46.934 --> 04:48.100
  YEAH.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.334
 LISTEN, UH,

04:49.434 --> 04:50.534
WHILE WE'RE STILL ON GOOD
TERMS WITH THE DOMINION,

04:50.634 --> 04:51.801
DO YOU THINK YOU
 COULD GET YOUR FRIENDS

04:51.901 --> 04:54.400
TO GET US A CRANK 38 DUAL
PROCESSOR FOR THE HELIX?

04:54.501 --> 04:55.601
 WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE OLD ONE?

04:55.701 --> 04:56.667
 OH, NOTHING.

04:56.767 --> 04:59.667
IT'S JUST THIS ONE'S
BIGGER... BETTER.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.033
 WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME?

05:03.133 --> 05:04.334
 SORRY?

05:04.434 --> 05:06.334
IF I'M GOING TO CALL
 YOU IN A FAVOUR,

05:06.434 --> 05:09.033
 WHAT ARE YOU WILLING
TO DO FOR ME, HM?

05:09.133 --> 05:10.801
 UM...

05:10.901 --> 05:12.434
 WHADDYA WANT?

05:12.534 --> 05:14.200
 HMM...

05:15.834 --> 05:16.968
OH!

05:17.100 --> 05:20.534
 WELL, YOU COULD
PAINT MY TOENAILS.

05:20.634 --> 05:21.167
HM?

05:21.267 --> 05:22.334
DREAM ON.

05:22.434 --> 05:23.501
DREAM ON?

05:23.601 --> 05:25.434
  <i>HEY, JESS?</i>

05:27.667 --> 05:29.567
  YEAH?

05:36.467 --> 05:39.300
 HEY, SO HOW
WAS THE MOVIE?

05:39.400 --> 05:41.367
 I'LL TELL YOU WHEN I ACTUALLY
 GET A CHANCE TO SEE IT.

05:41.467 --> 05:42.734
 JESS, CAN YOU
DO ME A FAVOUR?

05:42.834 --> 05:44.868
 I NEED YOU TO RUN A TRACE
 ON A CALL I GOT EARLIER

05:44.968 --> 05:46.133
 FROM A FRIEND OF MINE.

05:46.234 --> 05:47.634
 I'LL SEE WHAT
  I CAN DO.

05:47.734 --> 05:49.167
GIA DUCHAMPS.

05:49.267 --> 05:50.400
UH HUH.

05:50.501 --> 05:52.067
SHALIMAR SEEMS TO THINK
SOMETHING'S HAPPENED TO HER.

05:52.167 --> 05:53.434
  I THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO
CALL BACK AND SHE DIDN'T.

05:53.534 --> 05:54.901
I HAVE NO WAY OF
 GETTING HOLD OF HER.

05:55.000 --> 05:55.968
SHAL, SERIOUSLY,

05:56.067 --> 05:57.434
I'M SURE THERE'S
 NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

05:57.534 --> 05:58.968
BESIDES, YOU KNOW HOW GIA
ALWAYS FLAKES OUT ON YOU.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.300
BREN, WILL YOU STOP IT, PLEASE?

06:02.400 --> 06:03.801
WELL, THE CALLER ID WAS BLOCKED.

06:03.901 --> 06:05.267
YEAH, I KNOW.

06:05.367 --> 06:06.868
 OKAY. WELL, IT'S GOING
  TO TAKE SOME WORK,

06:06.968 --> 06:08.901
 BUT I SHOULD BE ABLE TO TRACE
 THE CALL TO THE PHONE COMPANY.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.234
SOONER THE BETTER, OKAY?

06:10.334 --> 06:11.400
 YEAH, YEAH.

06:11.501 --> 06:12.634
THANKS.

06:17.767 --> 06:19.367
 SO, MR. GITRE, BEFORE
WE COMPLETE THE DESIGN,

06:19.467 --> 06:20.701
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU
WOULD LIKE US TO ADD

06:20.801 --> 06:22.200
 TO GIA'S
PSYCHOLOGICAL MAKEUP?

06:22.300 --> 06:23.667
 I JUST WANT HER TO BE
 CLASSY ON THE OUTSIDE -

06:23.767 --> 06:25.067
  AND NASTY IN THE BEDROOM.

06:25.167 --> 06:26.200
<laughing>
 RIGHT.

06:26.300 --> 06:27.667
  ACCORDING TO YOUR
SPECIFICATIONS,

06:27.767 --> 06:29.767
 GIA WILL BE ATHLETIC, ABLE
 TO SPEAK FRENCH FLUENTLY...

06:29.868 --> 06:31.067
 AND SHE'LL DO ANYTHING
 I TELL HER TO?

06:31.167 --> 06:32.400
 UH, WITHIN REASON.

06:32.501 --> 06:34.400
UNDERSTAND THAT GIA'S BEEN
DESIGNED FOR PLEASURE...

06:34.501 --> 06:35.868
  NOTHING MORE.

06:35.968 --> 06:36.767
BUT SHE IS HUMAN?

06:36.868 --> 06:38.234
BETTER.

06:38.334 --> 06:39.767
SHE'S WHAT WE CALL A SYNTHETIC.

06:39.868 --> 06:41.868
IT'S A FORM OF ORGANIC
NANOTECHNOLOGY,

06:41.968 --> 06:42.934
AND THE BEST PART IS,

06:43.033 --> 06:45.467
SHE'LL NEVER AGE,
AND SHE'LL NEVER ARGUE.

06:45.567 --> 06:46.901
RIGHT. REST ASSURED.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.767
 SHE'S BEEN BIOENGINEERED TO
 LOOK AND FEEL COMPLETELY HUMAN.

06:48.868 --> 06:50.767
HER OWN MOTHER WOULDN'T BE
ABLE TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE.

06:50.868 --> 06:52.234
TRUST ME, MR. GITRE,

06:52.334 --> 06:54.567
 YOU'RE GOING TO BE
COMPLETELY SATISFIED.

06:54.667 --> 06:57.400
 OH, I'M SURE I WILL.

07:00.133 --> 07:03.300
 AND A HELL OF A LOT CHEAPER
 THAN ANOTHER DIVORCE.

07:04.400 --> 07:06.067
THERE'S ONE LAST THING.

07:06.167 --> 07:10.200
THIS TRANSACTION HAS TO BE
 COMPLETELY CONFIDENTIAL.

07:10.300 --> 07:12.834
NOW, I CAN'T STRESS
  THAT ENOUGH.

07:12.934 --> 07:14.167
ANY NON-COMPLIANCE
WILL RESULT

07:14.267 --> 07:16.834
IN THE IMMEDIATE TERMINATION
 OF THIS AGREEMENT -

07:16.934 --> 07:18.968
WITH EXTREME
 PREJUDICE.

07:19.067 --> 07:21.834
UNDERSTAND?

07:21.934 --> 07:23.234
 YES.

07:24.067 --> 07:25.467
GOOD.

07:29.667 --> 07:31.734
 MR. GITRE...

07:31.834 --> 07:33.501
 GIA.

07:40.334 --> 07:42.467
  HELLO, LOVER.

07:51.501 --> 07:53.968
YOU'RE REALLY WORRIED
ABOUT THIS GIRL, HUH?

07:54.067 --> 07:56.701
 I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
TWO WERE SO CLOSE.

07:56.801 --> 07:58.567
YEAH, WELL, WE WERE.

08:00.100 --> 08:01.200
BEFORE I JOINED
  MUTANT X

08:01.300 --> 08:02.467
I LIVED ON THE
 STREETS FOR A WHILE

08:02.567 --> 08:05.033
 AND GIA AND I KINDA LOOKED
OUT FOR ONE ANOTHER.

08:05.133 --> 08:06.501
HUH.

08:06.601 --> 08:08.434
I GUESS WE ALL BROUGHT
ALONG A LITTLE BAGGAGE

08:08.534 --> 08:11.501
WHEN WE JOINED MUTANT X.

08:14.367 --> 08:15.968
IT'S JUST THAT LAST
TIME I TALKED TO HER,

08:16.067 --> 08:19.100
I REALLY THOUGHT SHE WAS
GOING TO GET HER LIFE
TOGETHER, YOU KNOW?

08:19.200 --> 08:20.634
YOU KNOW WHAT, SHAL?

08:20.734 --> 08:25.567
THERE'S ONE THING I'VE LEARNED,
IS NEVER UNDERESTIMATE A FERAL.

08:26.901 --> 08:28.434
  <i>WHOO HOO.</i>

08:28.534 --> 08:30.501
TRACED THE CALL.

08:30.601 --> 08:34.433
 IT CAME FROM...

08:34.534 --> 08:35.767
 AH...

08:35.868 --> 08:39.767
AN ULTRA-EXCLUSIVE GENTLEMEN'S
CLUB CALLED NERO'S WAKE.

08:39.868 --> 08:42.501
IT'S RUN BY A GUY NAMED...

08:42.601 --> 08:44.167
...SEBASTIAN CONWAY.

08:44.267 --> 08:46.968
 <i>HI. I'M MELODY.
 <i>WELCOME TO NERO'S WAKE.</i></i>

08:47.067 --> 08:49.767
  <i>MEMBERS CAN PROCEED BY
  <i>ENTERING YOUR PASSWORD NOW...</i></i>

08:49.868 --> 08:53.133
 WAIT A MINUTE - GIA WAS SOME
 KIND OF HIGH-CLASS PLAYMATE?

08:53.234 --> 08:54.734
OH, HIGH CLASS, I'LL SAY.

08:54.834 --> 08:58.334
YOU GOTTA BE FORTUNE 500 JUST
 TO BREATH THE AIR IN THERE.

08:58.434 --> 09:01.567
MAYBE - IF YOU'RE A GUY.

09:07.667 --> 09:52.934
[*]

09:53.033 --> 09:54.934
THIS PLACE IS REALLY
 JUMPING TONIGHT.

09:55.033 --> 09:57.634
 ALWAYS.

09:57.734 --> 09:59.100
 I'M LOOKING FOR
A FRIEND OF MINE.

09:59.200 --> 10:00.300
HER NAME'S GIA DUCHAMPS.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.334
I THINK SHE WORKS HERE.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.300
 LUCKY GIRL.

10:02.400 --> 10:04.667
SHE MADE FRIENDS
WITH A REAL WHALE.

10:04.767 --> 10:05.567
A HOT CATCH?

10:05.667 --> 10:07.767
 A GUY WITH
 LOTS OF MONEY?

10:07.868 --> 10:09.601
 MUST BE AN
OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD.

10:09.701 --> 10:11.467
UM...

10:11.567 --> 10:13.100
  DO YOU KNOW
WHERE SHE IS NOW?

10:13.200 --> 10:15.033
SAW HER HEAD BACK TO
THE PLATINUM LOUNGE

10:15.133 --> 10:17.033
 A LITTLE WHILE AGO.

10:18.634 --> 10:21.834
 GUESS THEY MUST BE
 REALLY HITTING IT OFF.

10:24.067 --> 10:25.934
YOU WORKING?

10:26.033 --> 10:26.701
I'M SORRY?

10:26.801 --> 10:28.100
A GIRL LIKE YOU

10:28.200 --> 10:29.968
  COULD BRING IN A COUPLE
  OF GRAND IN TIPS A NIGHT.

10:30.067 --> 10:31.968
 SEBASTIAN WOULD ADORE YOU.

10:32.067 --> 10:34.901
WELL, HE SOUNDS LIKE
A GUY I SHOULD MEET.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.334
HE KNOWS HOW TO KEEP
HIS GIRLS HAPPY.

10:40.801 --> 10:41.968
THANKS...

10:46.467 --> 10:48.334
GIA!

10:48.434 --> 10:49.467
 HEY...

10:49.567 --> 10:50.634
 THANK YOU FOR DOING
 BUSINESS WITH US.

10:50.734 --> 10:51.601
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

10:51.701 --> 10:53.467
I REALLY HOPE YOU
ENJOY YOURSELF.

10:53.567 --> 10:54.567
I'M SORRY?

10:54.667 --> 10:56.200
WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:56.300 --> 10:57.501
I'M SORRY.

10:57.601 --> 10:59.801
I THINK YOU MUST HAVE ME
CONFUSED WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

11:01.634 --> 11:03.300
  THIS ISN'T FUNNY.

11:03.400 --> 11:05.701
 YOU CALLED ME.

11:05.801 --> 11:07.334
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

11:07.434 --> 11:08.467
 HI.

11:08.567 --> 11:10.234
KEVIN GITRE.

11:10.334 --> 11:12.334
HI.

11:12.434 --> 11:14.267
GIA, WE REALLY
SHOULD BE GOING.

11:14.367 --> 11:16.367
OF COURSE, ANGEL.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.100
 OH!

11:24.200 --> 11:25.033
NOT AGAIN...

11:25.133 --> 11:26.534
  I'M GOING TO KILL IT!

11:26.634 --> 11:28.667
 <sigh>

11:28.767 --> 11:29.501
HUH.

11:29.601 --> 11:30.968
  YEAH.

11:32.200 --> 11:33.100
 HELLO?

11:33.200 --> 11:35.133
 DAMSEL IN DISTRESS,
 AISLE 2?

11:35.234 --> 11:36.534
YEAH.

11:36.634 --> 11:39.033
THAT IS REALLY
LOCKED UP ON YOU.

11:39.133 --> 11:41.400
 I BET YOU'D
LIKE SOME HELP.

11:41.501 --> 11:42.801
 OH... WHAT DO YOU WANT?

11:42.901 --> 11:44.200
 ME TO PAINT YOUR TOENAILS?

11:44.300 --> 11:45.334
 YOU KNOW, I WAS
ACTUALLY THINKING

11:45.434 --> 11:46.801
MORE ALONG THE LINES OF UH...

11:46.901 --> 11:48.934
I DON'T KNOW...

11:49.033 --> 11:50.167
...FULL BODY MASSAGE.

11:50.267 --> 11:51.801
 OH! REALLY!

11:51.901 --> 11:53.400
 HUH, NOW
  WHO'S DREAMING?

11:55.200 --> 11:57.801
HEY! DID YOU  FIND
YOUR, UH... FRIEND?

11:57.901 --> 11:58.968
SORT OF.

11:59.067 --> 12:00.300
 SHE WAS ACTING REALLY
 STRANGE, THOUGH.

12:00.400 --> 12:02.000
 IT WAS LIKE SHE DIDN'T
 EVEN RECOGNIZE ME.

12:02.100 --> 12:03.367
 HUH. EH, WELL,
 PEOPLE CHANGE.

12:03.467 --> 12:04.667
 NOT LIKE THIS.

12:04.767 --> 12:06.400
  I MEAN, SHE WAS
  REALLY DIFFERENT.

12:06.501 --> 12:07.501
LOOK, JESS, DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN FIND ANYTHING

12:07.601 --> 12:08.734
  ON THE GUY SHE LEFT WITH?

12:08.834 --> 12:10.033
HIS NAME'S KEVIN GITRE.

12:10.133 --> 12:11.300
SURE.

12:11.400 --> 12:13.400
  OH, RIGHT.

12:13.501 --> 12:14.601
 MAYBE YOUR FRIEND BLEW YOU OFF

12:14.701 --> 12:15.901
BECAUSE SHE WAS
TRYING TO PLAY THIS GUY.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.767
YEAH, WELL, IF SHE DID, THEN
SHE WAS REALLY CONVINCING.

12:18.868 --> 12:20.367
GITRE...

12:24.300 --> 12:25.634
 ALL RIGHT, HE'S
 MARRIED WITH TWO KIDS.

12:25.734 --> 12:29.834
 HAS A <i>SLAMMIN' HOUSE
 IN THE SUBURBS.</i>

12:29.934 --> 12:33.167
 OOOH, HE'S LOADED WITH
  A GREAT BIG GOLD L.

12:33.267 --> 12:37.033
HE'S THE HEIR TO
A CANDY FORTUNE.

12:37.133 --> 12:38.234
 HUH.

12:38.334 --> 12:40.634
 LISTEN, HE JUST LEASED
 A CONDO IN THE CITY.

12:40.734 --> 12:41.801
 UH HUH.

12:41.901 --> 12:44.133
COZY LITTLE LOVE NEST
FOR THE MISTRESS, MAYBE?

12:44.234 --> 12:45.534
 AND SHE'S GOT A
 GREAT BIG ALLOWANCE.

12:45.634 --> 12:47.000
  HE JUST WITHDREW A QUARTER
 OF A MILLION DOLLARS

12:47.100 --> 12:49.067
 FROM HIS BANK ACCOUNT
 TWO DAYS AGO.

12:49.167 --> 12:51.501
OH, THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY
 TO BE THROWING AROUND.

12:51.601 --> 12:54.901
  MAYBE IT'S TIME WE FIND OUT
WHAT HE'S SPENDING IT ON.

13:01.367 --> 13:02.567
DO YOU HEAR THAT?

13:02.667 --> 13:05.033
 [distant cries]

13:05.133 --> 13:06.734
  WHAT THE HELL IS
  SHE DOING TO HIM?

13:06.834 --> 13:07.968
 AGHH...

13:08.067 --> 13:09.334
AGH.

13:10.534 --> 13:12.968
 WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?

13:13.067 --> 13:14.167
OH, IT'S...

13:14.267 --> 13:16.434
IT'S FUNNY, I WAS ABOUT
TO ASK YOU THE SAME THING.

13:16.534 --> 13:18.534
 DON'T WORRY, GIA,
WE'RE HERE TO HELP.

13:18.634 --> 13:19.701
SO YOU, UH...

13:19.801 --> 13:21.300
MIND TELLING ME WHAT'S
  GOING ON HERE...

13:21.400 --> 13:22.300
PRINCESS?

13:22.400 --> 13:23.567
 I DON'T OWE YOU
ANY EXPLANATION.

13:23.667 --> 13:25.534
 NOW GET THE HELL OUT
BEFORE I CALL THE POLICE.

13:25.634 --> 13:26.601
UH, NO.

13:26.701 --> 13:27.801
MIGHT WANT TO RETHINK
 THAT, BECAUSE, UH,

13:27.901 --> 13:29.100
WE CAN ALWAYS CALL
  UP YOUR WIFE

13:29.200 --> 13:30.534
AND TELL HER ABOUT YOUR
 LITTLE FETISH HERE.

13:30.634 --> 13:31.567
  OH.

13:31.667 --> 13:32.868
  SO IS THAT
 WHAT THIS IS?

13:32.968 --> 13:34.868
 A SHAKEDOWN FOR
  MORE MONEY?

13:34.968 --> 13:37.434
  WELL, YOU TELL SEBASTIAN HE'S
  MESSING WITH THE WRONG MAN.

13:37.534 --> 13:39.934
  WE HAVE A SIGNED CONTRACT.

13:40.033 --> 13:41.334
 WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

13:41.434 --> 13:42.567
 GIA.

13:42.667 --> 13:43.801
SHE'S MINE.

13:43.901 --> 13:46.167
I CAN DO WHATEVER
I WANT WITH HER.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.801
 YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
  SAID THAT, LOVER.

13:48.901 --> 13:50.100
NO, GIA,
STAY OUT OF THIS.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.300
 THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO
 BE OUR LITTLE SECRET.

13:52.400 --> 13:53.801
 AGH...

13:53.901 --> 13:56.467
 NO, NO. NO...

14:18.200 --> 14:19.667
SHE'S GONE.

14:19.767 --> 14:20.734
 NO.

14:20.834 --> 14:23.300
 THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

14:32.801 --> 14:34.334
 WHAT THE HELL
 DID SHE DO?

14:34.434 --> 14:37.234
 I'VE RIGGED HER
RETINAL SCANNERS.

14:37.334 --> 14:39.601
WE'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT.

14:43.567 --> 14:44.567
  <i>WELL, YOU TELL SEBASTIAN</i>

14:44.667 --> 14:45.968
  <i>HE'S MESSING WITH
  <i>THE WRONG MAN.</i></i>

14:46.067 --> 14:47.868
  <i>WE HAVE A
  <i>SIGNED CONTRACT.</i></i>

14:47.968 --> 14:49.267
 <i>WHAT ARE YOU
 <i>TALKING ABOUT?</i></i>

14:49.367 --> 14:51.234
 <i>GIA. SHE'S MINE.</i>

14:51.334 --> 14:53.501
 <i>I CAN DO WHATEVER
 <i>I WANT WITH HER.</i></i>

14:53.601 --> 14:55.267
   <i>YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE

14:55.367 --> 14:56.601
  <i>OH, NO, GIA, STAY OUT OF THIS.</i>

14:56.701 --> 14:58.567
  <i>THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO

14:59.701 --> 15:01.667
  <i>NO, NO... NO.</i>

15:01.767 --> 15:04.067
 WELL, HE CAN'T SAY
 WE DIDN'T WARN HIM.

15:06.133 --> 15:07.534
 I KNOW HER.

15:07.634 --> 15:08.968
 SHE WAS TALKING TO
 GIA LAST NIGHT,

15:09.067 --> 15:10.968
 PROBABLY A FRIEND OF HERS.

15:11.067 --> 15:13.667
I DON'T LIKE THIS
AT ALL I TOLD YOU.

15:13.767 --> 15:15.767
I TOLD YOU THAT THE GIRLS
WE USE SHOULD BE RUNAWAYS.

15:15.868 --> 15:17.200
NO FRIENDS,
NO NEXT OF KIN.

15:17.300 --> 15:18.501
WE DON'T...

15:18.601 --> 15:19.901
YOU KNOW, WE DON'T NEED ANYONE
PRYING INTO OUR AFFAIRS.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.133
  RELAX, NOLAN.

15:21.234 --> 15:22.634
  THAT'S WHAT I'M
 HERE FOR, REMEMBER?

15:22.734 --> 15:24.868
 I TAKE CARE OF
  THESE THINGS.

15:24.968 --> 15:26.267
HUH, TAKE A LOOK AROUND.

15:26.367 --> 15:27.667
HUH? THINGS ARE
UNDER CONTROL.

15:27.767 --> 15:29.100
AS FAR AS THE POLICE
  ARE CONCERNED,

15:29.200 --> 15:31.300
 HE WAS KILLED BY A
PSYCHO STREETWALKER,

15:31.400 --> 15:36.133
 A STREETWALKER...
  WHO NO LONGER EXISTS.

15:39.367 --> 15:40.567
I KNOW IT SOUNDS
 CRAZY TO YOU,

15:40.667 --> 15:42.367
 BUT EVERYONE HAS THEIR
 OWN DISTINCTIVE SCENT

15:42.467 --> 15:44.100
 AND THAT WASN'T GIA.

15:44.200 --> 15:45.534
WELL, MAYBE SHE
 CHANGED HER PERFUME.

15:45.634 --> 15:47.567
 YEAH, BRENNAN,
THAT MUST BE IT.

15:47.667 --> 15:49.000
  WHAT?

15:49.100 --> 15:50.901
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHY I DIDN'T
PICK UP ON IT AT THE CLUB,

15:51.033 --> 15:53.467
 BUT THERE WERE SO
MANY PEOPLE AROUND.

15:53.567 --> 15:54.667
 ALL RIGHT.
 ALL RIGHT.

15:54.767 --> 15:56.000
 LET'S JUST SAY THAT
 THAT WASN'T GIA.

15:56.100 --> 15:57.000
IT WASN'T.

15:57.100 --> 15:58.734
AND WHATEVER SHE
WAS WASN'T HUMAN.

16:00.267 --> 16:01.501
  WELL, UH...

16:01.601 --> 16:03.167
 I'VE BEEN LOOKING INTO
 OUR MYSTERY MAN SEBASTIAN.

16:03.267 --> 16:04.434
 COMING UP WITH NADA.

16:04.534 --> 16:06.300
 IT'S AS IF THE GUY
 NEVER EVEN EXISTED.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.300
 YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:07.400 --> 16:08.667
I'M STARTING TO
AGREE WITH SHAL.

16:08.767 --> 16:10.000
 I MEAN, THERE'S GOTTA
BE SOMETHING MORE

16:10.100 --> 16:12.334
THAN JUST PARTYING GOING
 DOWN WITH THAT CLUB.

16:12.434 --> 16:14.767
 AND I THINK WE NEED
TO TAKE A LOOK AROUND.

16:14.868 --> 16:17.167
FROM THE INSIDE.

16:24.834 --> 16:25.968
HEY.
HEY.

16:26.067 --> 16:27.133
 TELL ME, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

16:27.234 --> 16:28.501
 A LITTLE TOO MOULIN ROUGE?

16:28.601 --> 16:29.801
<laughing>

16:29.901 --> 16:32.467
  A LITTLE
TOO SOMETHING.

16:32.567 --> 16:35.467
YOU KNOW, I CAN HANDLE THIS ON
MY OWN IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GO.

16:35.567 --> 16:36.567
ARE YOU KIDDING?

16:36.667 --> 16:38.467
I AM NOT LETTING YOU
GO BACK IN THERE ALONE.

16:38.567 --> 16:39.701
THIS MAKES MY
 BLOOD BOIL.

16:39.801 --> 16:41.534
OH, DON'T GET
 ME STARTED.

16:41.634 --> 16:43.467
 I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE HOW
DESPERATE GIA MUST HAVE BEEN

16:43.567 --> 16:44.801
TO TAKE THIS JOB.

16:44.901 --> 16:46.033
 YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:46.133 --> 16:47.367
THAT'S JUST IT.

16:47.467 --> 16:48.901
 THERE'S AN ENDLESS SUPPLY
 OF GIRLS, JUST LIKE GIA,

16:49.000 --> 16:51.400
WAITING TO TAKE
 HER PLACE.

16:51.501 --> 16:53.400
ADD TWO MORE
TO THE LIST.

16:53.501 --> 17:09.701
[*]

17:09.800 --> 17:11.032
SEBASTIAN CONWAY?

17:11.133 --> 17:12.534
 UH HUH...?

17:12.634 --> 17:13.733
I WAS HERE
LAST NIGHT.

17:13.834 --> 17:14.934
 REALLY?

17:15.032 --> 17:18.968
 WELL, I'M SORRY
WE DIDN'T HOOK UP.

17:19.067 --> 17:20.133
I HEARD THAT YOU
MIGHT BE LOOKING

17:20.233 --> 17:22.166
TO RECRUIT SOME
 NEW GIRLS.

17:26.733 --> 17:28.032
 VERY NICE.

17:28.133 --> 17:29.467
 <clears throat>
 EXCUSE US...

17:29.567 --> 17:30.968
  CAN I TALK TO
 YOU RIGHT NOW?

17:31.067 --> 17:32.300
GO BACK TO YOUR
 SEAT, NOLAN.

17:32.400 --> 17:33.734
  YEAH.

17:33.834 --> 17:36.400
NOW.

17:36.501 --> 17:38.567
 PAY'S $200 A NIGHT, THE
 TIPS ARE YOURS TO KEEP,

17:38.667 --> 17:40.133
 YOU START IMMEDIATELY.

17:40.234 --> 17:42.100
 ANY QUESTIONS?

17:42.200 --> 17:43.367
  NO.

17:43.467 --> 17:44.767
 PLAY YOUR CARDS
 RIGHT, GIRLS,

17:44.868 --> 17:46.734
YOU COULD WALK OUT OF HERE
WITH THE MAN OF YOUR DREAMS.

17:46.834 --> 17:48.200
HUH...

17:49.501 --> 17:51.200
 REALLY?

17:51.300 --> 17:53.334
  ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

17:53.434 --> 17:54.734
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE
 DOING, HIRING THEM?

17:54.834 --> 17:56.300
 IT'S LIKE THE
  GODFATHER, NOLAN.

17:56.400 --> 17:58.467
 YOU KEEP YOUR FRIENDS CLOSE
 - AND YOUR ENEMIES CLOSER.

17:58.567 --> 17:59.868
  OH. YEAH.

17:59.968 --> 18:01.067
 NO. NO, NO,
 NO, NO, NO.

18:01.167 --> 18:02.367
 THAT IS A MISTAKE.

18:02.467 --> 18:04.000
  SEE, THINGS ARE
 WAY OUT OF CONTROL.

18:04.100 --> 18:05.968
I THINK WHAT WE HAVE HERE
 IS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY

18:06.067 --> 18:08.167
STARING US IN THE FACE.

18:08.267 --> 18:09.400
 YOU KNOW WHAT
 I THINK?

18:09.501 --> 18:10.634
 I THINK IT WOULD BE
 PRUDENT TO SHUT DOWN.

18:10.734 --> 18:11.968
 YOU SHUT DOWN, YOU
 LET THINGS COOL OFF.

18:12.067 --> 18:13.767
OF COURSE, YOU WOULD
  DO THAT, NOLAN.

18:13.868 --> 18:17.467
THAT'S WHY I CALL THE
 SHOTS AROUND HERE.

18:21.334 --> 18:22.467
 <i>CONGRATULATIONS.</i>

19:06.100 --> 19:08.067
THAT I FIND A MODEL THAT
 I'M INTERESTED IN...

19:36.834 --> 19:39.100
SOMEBODY'S LOOKING FOR LOVE
 IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES.

19:39.200 --> 19:40.901
 <laughing>
 YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.300
ALL I NEED IS A
 HEALTHY BANK ACCOUNT

19:42.400 --> 19:44.067
  TO GET TO THE HEAD
 OF THE CLASS.

19:44.167 --> 19:46.133
  WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS
PLATINUM LOUNGE IS ALL ABOUT?

19:46.234 --> 19:48.701
 WELL, MY LITTLE GIRLFRIEND

 WELL, I GUESS IF
YOU GOT A BANKROLL,

19:53.400 --> 19:54.868
A QUARTER MILLION BUCKS
IS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY

19:54.968 --> 19:55.934
FOR THE PERFECT WOMAN.

19:56.033 --> 19:57.367
  YEAH.

19:57.467 --> 19:59.734
STILL THINK I'D LIKE TO FIND
A WOMAN THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY.

19:59.834 --> 20:00.701
WHAT?

20:00.801 --> 20:02.300
THROUGH PITY AND ALCOHOL?

20:02.400 --> 20:03.767
  WORKS FOR ME.

20:03.868 --> 20:05.100
HUH...

20:05.200 --> 20:06.200
GOOD FOR YOU.

20:06.300 --> 20:07.367
 <laughter>

20:07.467 --> 20:31.634
  [*]

20:31.734 --> 20:34.567
 HEY, LEX, HOW'S IT COMING OVER
  THERE IN SODOM AND GOMORRAH?

20:34.667 --> 20:36.067
BUSINESS AS USUAL.

20:36.167 --> 20:38.267
I'VE BEEN HIT ON MORE TIMES
 THAN OSCAR DE LA HOYA.

20:38.367 --> 20:39.501
WHAT'S UP?

20:39.601 --> 20:41.634
  OH, LOOKS LIKE NERO'S A FRONT

20:41.734 --> 20:43.367
FOR THE WHITE SLAVERY TRADE.

20:43.467 --> 20:45.300
THESE GIRLS ARE FOR SALE?

20:45.400 --> 20:46.634
 THEY SURE DON'T LOOK
 LIKE THEY'RE BEING HELD

20:46.734 --> 20:48.000
  AGAINST THEIR WILL.

20:48.100 --> 20:49.634
WELL, MAYBE THEY
 DON'T KNOW THEY ARE.

20:49.734 --> 20:50.968
 <i>ALL I KNOW IS SOMETHING
 <i>HAPPENS TO THEM</i></i>

20:51.067 --> 20:54.868
 <i>WHEN THEY GET INVITED
 <i>TO THE PLATINUM LOUNGE.</i></i>

20:54.968 --> 20:56.100
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

20:56.200 --> 20:57.367
  <i>WE DON'T KNOW.</i>

20:57.467 --> 20:58.501
 <i>BUT UNTIL WE DO,
 <i>STICK TOGETHER.</i></i>

20:58.601 --> 21:00.767
 WOULD YOU MIND COMING
 WITH ME FOR A SEC?

21:00.868 --> 21:02.400
 I'D LIKE YOU TO
 MEET SOMEBODY.

21:02.501 --> 21:05.334
THAT COULD BE A PROBLEM.

21:06.634 --> 21:07.734
OUR GUEST HERE

21:07.834 --> 21:08.934
WOULD LIKE TO GET TO KNOW
YOU A LITTLE BIT BETTER,

21:09.033 --> 21:10.934
 SO I'LL LEAVE
YOU TWO ALONE.

21:11.033 --> 21:12.033
  ALL RIGHT?

21:12.133 --> 21:14.000
 HI.
 HI.

21:14.100 --> 21:15.434
SO YOU HAVING
FUN TONIGHT?

21:15.534 --> 21:17.501
  OH, YEAH.

21:17.601 --> 21:19.033
  YOU REALLY LOOK SEXY.

21:19.133 --> 21:20.234
 THANKS.

21:20.334 --> 21:21.367
NOW WHY SETTLE
FOR JUST ONE...

21:21.467 --> 21:24.334
WHEN YOU CAN HAVE
 THE TWO OF US?

21:24.434 --> 21:27.667
 THINK OF ALL THE
FUN WE COULD HAVE.

21:33.434 --> 21:35.234
  <giggling>

21:35.334 --> 21:39.200
 FOR NOW THE BLONDES GET
 TO HAVE A BIT MORE FUN.

21:43.934 --> 21:46.400
I'LL BE OKAY.

21:46.501 --> 21:48.467
I HAVE TO GO IN THERE.

21:48.567 --> 21:49.901
I'LL CALL YOU IF I NEED YOU.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.868
  OKAY.

21:53.100 --> 21:55.300
 WHY DON'T YOU TAKE OUR GUEST
 TO THE PLATINUM LOUNGE,

21:55.400 --> 21:58.367
  AND WHY DON'T YOU
 COME WITH ME?

22:05.934 --> 22:07.234
 THAT'S IT.
I'M GOING IN.

22:07.334 --> 22:08.601
 CAN YOU GET ME AN
INVITE TO THIS PLACE?

22:08.701 --> 22:09.601
 YEAH, SURE.

22:09.701 --> 22:10.901
 WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE?

22:11.000 --> 22:12.567
AN OIL TYCOON?
 A POP STAR?

22:12.667 --> 22:14.601
OOOH, A CAPTAIN OF INDUSTRY.

22:14.701 --> 22:16.267
CAPTAIN OF INDUSTRY
  SOUNDS GOOD.

22:16.367 --> 22:18.267
 ALL RIGHT.
 YOU GOT IT.

22:18.367 --> 22:19.501
JUST GIVE ME
ENOUGH MONEY

22:19.601 --> 22:20.701
TO MAKE THIS
GUY SEBASTIAN

22:20.801 --> 22:21.667
 MY NEW BEST
FRIEND, HUH?

22:21.767 --> 22:22.934
  SURE.

22:23.033 --> 22:24.367
DID YOU MANAGE TO FIND
ANYTHING ELSE ON THIS GUY?

22:24.467 --> 22:25.634
NAH, NOT REALLY.

22:25.734 --> 22:27.434
EXCEPT THE PLACE IS REALLY
OWNED BY A NOLAN BLACKLEDGE.

22:27.534 --> 22:28.434
WHO'S HE?

22:28.534 --> 22:30.133
 I DON'T KNOW,
 I'M WORKING ON IT.

22:30.234 --> 22:31.200
 ALL RIGHT.
LET ME KNOW.

22:31.300 --> 22:32.634
  YEAH.

22:40.567 --> 22:43.767
WHAT'S GOING ON?

22:43.868 --> 22:45.434
YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T HAVE
 STUCK YOUR PRETTY LITTLE NOSE

22:45.534 --> 22:47.567
 WHERE IT DIDN'T BELONG.

22:53.868 --> 22:55.367
 UHHH!

22:57.734 --> 23:01.767
 LOOKS LIKE WE'VE CAUGHT
  ANOTHER ONE, BOYS.

23:09.367 --> 23:11.534
I WANT TO CLONE HER
BODY AND HER BRAIN,

23:11.634 --> 23:14.167
PERSONALITY, MEMORY,
 EVERYTHING.

23:14.267 --> 23:16.667
 UH, I... I'VE NEVER
  ATTEMPTED AN...

23:16.767 --> 23:17.968
 ENTIRE REPLICATION.

23:18.067 --> 23:20.100
  WELL, IT'S OBVIOUS
SHE'S NOT WORKING ALONE.

23:20.200 --> 23:21.400
WE NEED TO KNOW
WHAT SHE KNOWS

23:21.501 --> 23:23.000
IN ORDER TO TURN IT
 TO OUR ADVANTAGE.

23:23.100 --> 23:25.033
  MEMORIES ARE NOTHING MORE
  THAN ELECTRONIC IMPULSES,

23:25.133 --> 23:27.000
  SO WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO
 REPRODUCE THEM ORGANICALLY.

23:27.100 --> 23:28.267
I MEAN, THERE'S
  GONNA BE HOLES...

23:28.367 --> 23:29.701
 I KNOW I CAN'T
  REPLICATE EVERYTHING.

23:29.801 --> 23:31.033
THAT'S FINE.

23:31.133 --> 23:32.834
THERE'S NO REASON IT SHOULDN'T
 WORK LIKE THE OTHERS.

23:32.934 --> 23:35.100
THE KEY IS TO MAINTAIN
 CONTROL OF HER MIND.

23:35.200 --> 23:37.133
 THEN WE SEND HER BACK
TO WHERE SHE CAME FROM

23:37.234 --> 23:38.801
AS A TROJAN HORSE.

23:38.901 --> 23:41.467
PROBLEM SOLVED.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.167
  YOU REALIZE
 SHE'S A MUTANT?

23:45.267 --> 23:47.534
OF COURSE I DO.

23:47.634 --> 23:49.767
 HOW MANY OF THOSE FREAKS
DID YOU PEOPLE MAKE ANYWAY?

23:49.868 --> 23:51.234
  WELL, NOT AS MANY
 AS I'D HAVE LIKED.

23:51.334 --> 23:53.400
  LOOK,
 THEY'RE EXTRAORDINARY.

23:53.501 --> 23:56.300
 WE LABEL HER AS
ONE OF THE EXOTICS.

23:56.400 --> 23:58.267
CAN YOU IMAGINE THE PRICE
  HER KIND WILL FETCH

23:58.367 --> 24:00.601
WHEN ALL THIS IS OVER?

24:23.701 --> 24:42.534
[*]

24:42.634 --> 24:43.767
 SORRY.

24:43.868 --> 24:45.033
RELAX, BOYS.

JUST WORKING THE ROOM.

24:51.300 --> 24:52.367
HELLO, ANGELS.

24:52.467 --> 24:54.200
  SORRY, CHARLIE,
MAKE THAT ONE ANGEL.

24:54.300 --> 24:56.367
WHY? WHAT'S GOING ON?

24:56.467 --> 24:57.567
 WELL, SHAL TOOK ONE
  OF OUR CLIENTS

24:57.667 --> 24:58.734
 BACK IN THE
PLATINUM LOUNGE.

24:58.834 --> 25:00.100
 SAID SHE'D GIVE
 ME A HEADS UP

25:00.200 --> 25:01.367
IF THINGS GOT DICEY.

25:01.467 --> 25:02.934
WELL, BRENNAN'S ON
HIS WAY OVER THERE

25:03.033 --> 25:05.167
TO START RUBBING ELBOWS
WITH SEBASTIAN.

25:05.267 --> 25:06.467
 WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?

25:06.567 --> 25:08.634
 WELL, THE GUY WHO'S
REALLY BEHIND NERO'S

25:08.734 --> 25:11.734
 IS A GUY NAMED
NOLAN BLACKLEDGE.

25:11.834 --> 25:13.901
HE'S A GENOMEX ALUMNI.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.834
 HUH, OF COURSE.

25:15.934 --> 25:17.434
 DAMN, I'D LOVE TO
KNOW WHAT EVIL JUICE

25:17.534 --> 25:19.133
THEY PUT IN THAT
 WATER COOLER.

25:19.234 --> 25:20.801
YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT IT.

25:20.901 --> 25:25.400
 THIS GUY SPECIALIZED IN
ORGANIC NANOBOT TECHNOLOGY.

25:25.501 --> 25:27.601
WHEN GENOMEX FOLDED,
  HE DISAPPEARED.

25:27.701 --> 25:28.834
SO WHAT?

25:28.934 --> 25:30.734
 OPENED UP A HIGH CLASS
 GENTLEMEN'S CLUB?

25:30.834 --> 25:32.100
 TALK ABOUT A CHANGE
 OF CAREERS.

25:32.200 --> 25:33.667
WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW
 WITH THESE GUYS.

25:33.767 --> 25:35.767
MAYBE HE DIDN'T.

25:37.267 --> 25:39.234
 OH, HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

25:39.334 --> 25:41.133
HERE COMES SHAL.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.400
 HEY, WHAT HAPPENED?

25:45.501 --> 25:46.367

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
ONCE OVER AND THE
BIG OLD PASADENA.

25:50.100 --> 25:52.167
APPARENTLY I'M
 NOT HIS TYPE.

25:52.267 --> 25:54.100
 I THINK HE'S
HOTTER FOR YOU.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.200
 OH. LUCKY ME.

25:56.300 --> 25:58.267
 DON'T TAKE IT
 PERSONALLY.

25:59.934 --> 26:01.834
 OH, I WON'T.

 LOVELY, ISN'T SHE?

27:17.234 --> 27:18.400
YEAH.

UNFORTUNATELY,
 MY TASTES,

UH, HAPPEN TO LEAN

27:21.367 --> 27:22.367

WILD SIDE.

27:22.467 --> 27:23.534
 OH, REALLY?

27:23.634 --> 27:24.868
 WELL, THEN, MAYBE
 I CAN INTEREST YOU

27:24.968 --> 27:26.901

27:58.100 --> 28:00.434
 REALLY?

28:02.501 --> 28:04.801

 I'M ASKING.

28:04.901 --> 28:07.901
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE

28:16.200 --> 28:17.167
NICE WORK.

29:38.167 --> 29:39.167
 UM...

29:39.267 --> 29:40.400
LISTEN, I GOT A BAD
FEELING ABOUT THIS.

29:40.501 --> 29:41.701
NOLAN, WILL YOU PLEASE RELAX.

29:41.801 --> 29:43.067
ROME IS NOT
 BURNING.

29:43.167 --> 29:44.300
EXCUSE US.

29:44.400 --> 29:46.133
BESIDES, C'MERE.

29:46.234 --> 29:47.300
ONCE WE'RE THROUGH
WITH THIS,

29:47.400 --> 29:48.501
WE'RE GOING TO
BE ABLE TO MAKE

29:48.601 --> 29:49.801
AS MANY COPIES OF THOSE
FREAKS AS WE WANT.

29:49.901 --> 29:50.901
 TOO MANY
 LOOSE ENDS.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.601
AND WE'RE SEWING
THEM UP AS WE SPEAK.

29:53.701 --> 29:54.934
 HOW CAN YOU JUST SIT THERE

29:55.033 --> 29:56.534
 LIKE YOU HAVEN'T A
 CARE IN THE WORLD?

29:56.634 --> 29:57.701
WHAT CAN I TELL YOU, NOLAN?

29:57.801 --> 29:59.033
IT'S GOOD TO BE ME.

29:59.133 --> 30:00.501
YOU OUGHT TO LEARN
 BY MY EXAMPLE.

30:00.601 --> 30:03.734
  <phone rings>
 NOLAN.

30:03.834 --> 30:05.133
  WHAT?

30:05.234 --> 30:06.801
  YEAH. YEAH...

30:06.901 --> 30:08.767
 SEE? WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

30:08.868 --> 30:10.667
 WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH
  ONE OF YOUR MUTANTS.

30:10.767 --> 30:12.300
 ACCIDENTAL
  OVERDOSE.

30:12.400 --> 30:13.501
WELL, THEN, WHAT ARE
 YOU DOING UP HERE?

30:13.601 --> 30:15.000
GO PROTECT OUR
 INVESTMENT.

30:15.100 --> 30:16.968
GO.

30:24.334 --> 30:25.901
HOW COULD YOU LET
 THIS HAPPEN?

30:26.000 --> 30:27.434
 I PUT HER ON THE
DRIP YOU PRESCRIBED.

30:27.534 --> 30:28.634
ALL RIGHT,
GET HER UP.

30:28.734 --> 30:31.234
I'LL TAKE HER BY THE LAB
AND I'LL CHECK HER OUT.

30:42.100 --> 30:43.467
THEY'VE GOT CAMERAS
ALL OVER THE PLACE,

30:43.567 --> 30:46.767
 SO DO YOUR BEST TO
KEEP UP APPEARANCES?

30:55.033 --> 30:57.267
  WHAT'S WRONG?

30:57.367 --> 30:59.734
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME?

30:59.834 --> 31:02.334
 I THINK THEY'VE
  TAKEN LEXA.

31:02.434 --> 31:04.133
 HOW LONG'S IT BEEN
SINCE YOU'VE SEEN HER?

31:04.234 --> 31:05.300
  JUST BEFORE YOU GOT HERE.

31:05.400 --> 31:07.634
 SHE WAS NOSING
 AROUND IN THE BACK.

31:17.567 --> 31:18.501
WHAT ARE YOU
 DOING HERE?

31:18.601 --> 31:19.601
 IT'S OKAY.

31:19.701 --> 31:20.901
 SHAL AND BRENNAN
 GOT THINGS COVERED.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.100
 WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

31:23.200 --> 31:25.434
UH, WELL, I'VE BEEN POURING
 OVER NOLAN'S RESEARCH.

31:25.534 --> 31:27.133
HE'S A GENIUS.

31:27.234 --> 31:28.501
 HOW SO?

31:28.601 --> 31:31.567
HE'S FIGURED OUT HOW TO
CREATE SYNTHETIC CLONES

31:31.667 --> 31:35.100
BY COMBINING GENETICS
WITH NANOTECHNOLOGY.

31:35.200 --> 31:37.801
 HIS SYNTHETIC CLONES ARE
VIRTUALLY INDISTINGUISHABLE

31:37.901 --> 31:39.701
FROM THEIR HUMAN COUNTERPARTS.

31:44.868 --> 31:47.834
  WHAT?

31:47.934 --> 31:50.501
NOTHING.

31:50.601 --> 31:52.467
IT'S JUST I, UH...

31:52.567 --> 31:56.534
 NEVER REALIZED HOW
GOOD LOOKING YOU ARE.

31:58.734 --> 31:59.934
SHUT UP.

32:00.033 --> 32:02.167
I'M SERIOUS.

32:05.701 --> 32:08.601
  YOU JUST LOVE MESSING
WITH ME, DON'T YOU?

32:08.701 --> 32:10.968
NO, BUT I'D LIKE TO.

32:28.634 --> 32:30.267
OKAY...

32:38.400 --> 32:41.334
NOW YOU KNOW WHY I
 REALLY CAME BACK HERE.

33:05.133 --> 33:08.434
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE
 THEY MAY HAVE TAKEN LEXA?

33:12.133 --> 33:13.100
 I DON'T KNOW.

33:13.200 --> 33:14.767
I ONLY LEFT HER
ALONE FOR A MINUTE.

33:14.868 --> 33:16.100
BUT, THIS PLACE
GOES ON FOREVER.

33:16.200 --> 33:18.701
 SHE COULD BE IN ANY
 ONE OF THESE ROOMS.

33:21.033 --> 33:23.567
 WHY ARE YOU LOOKING
 AT ME LIKE THAT?

33:23.667 --> 33:25.100
LIKE WHAT?

33:25.200 --> 33:27.367
 LIKE YOU DON'T
 EVEN KNOW ME?

33:27.467 --> 33:29.934
BRENNAN, I'M NOT
THE ENEMY HERE.

33:33.968 --> 33:37.400
 THERE'S ONE MORE THING
  I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

33:37.501 --> 33:39.367
YOU'RE ABOUT TO DIE!
HUHH!

33:53.467 --> 33:57.634
LEXA, WHAT DO YOU...?

33:57.734 --> 33:58.901
 COME ON, JESS,

33:59.000 --> 34:01.467
YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO
PLAY IT LIKE THIS, DO YOU?

34:01.567 --> 34:03.400
 AGH...

34:03.501 --> 34:05.901
BRENNAN!

34:06.000 --> 34:07.968
BRENNAN!

34:11.100 --> 34:12.634
THEY'RE ON TO US!

34:12.734 --> 34:15.067
 <gasp>

34:15.167 --> 34:17.100
SEBASTIAN'S BEEN POPPING
OFF CLONES OF THE GIRLS.

34:17.199 --> 34:19.100
  GIA, LEXA, THEY'RE
 ALL SYNTHETICS.

34:19.199 --> 34:21.766
 I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO
 PULL THE PLUG ON THEM.

34:24.801 --> 34:28.132
 WAIT, NANOTECHNOLOGY'S
BASED ON BIOELECTRONICS.
 WHICH MEANS...

34:28.234 --> 34:30.000
 AHH!!

35:03.868 --> 35:05.000
LOOKING FOR SOMEONE?

35:05.100 --> 35:06.534
UH, SHALIMAR, YOU...

35:06.634 --> 35:08.234
 UH, YOU SHOULD
JUST SIT AND RELAX.

35:08.334 --> 35:09.634
YOU'RE GOING TO BE... FINE.

35:09.734 --> 35:11.033
 DAMN STRAIGHT IT WILL.

35:11.133 --> 35:12.033
PLEASE DON'T HURT ME.

35:12.133 --> 35:13.467
SEBASTIAN, HE'S THE
ONE THAT YOU WANT.

35:13.567 --> 35:14.400
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

35:14.501 --> 35:15.667
I NEVER INTENDED
TO HURT ANYONE.

35:15.767 --> 35:16.567
WHERE IS HE?

35:16.667 --> 35:17.734
 UH, HE'S UP
IN THE CLUB.

35:17.834 --> 35:18.968
RIGHT NOW, HE'S
UP IN THE CLUB.

35:19.100 --> 35:20.334
I DIDN'T HAVE
 A CHOICE.

35:20.434 --> 35:22.367
 OH!!

35:22.467 --> 35:24.734
 WE ALL HAVE
 CHOICES.

35:38.968 --> 35:42.234
  COME OUT, COME OUT
WHEREVER YOU ARE.

35:59.834 --> 36:01.567
LET HIM GO!

36:04.801 --> 36:06.434
<gasp>

36:07.901 --> 36:09.868
SHAME TO MESS UP
THAT PRETTY FACE.

36:14.334 --> 36:16.133
WHAT'S A GIRL
  TO DO?

36:35.334 --> 36:39.234
 OH, MAN, THAT'S
  JUST NASTY.

36:42.868 --> 36:44.300
BRENNAN?
JESSE.

36:44.400 --> 36:46.534
  FINALLY FIGURED
 OUT THE OFF SWITCH.

36:46.634 --> 36:49.701
 SINCE THESE GUYS ARE BASED
  ON NANOTECHNOLOGY, THE...

36:49.801 --> 36:51.267
JUST CUT TO IT!

36:51.367 --> 36:52.834
ELECTRICITY.

36:52.934 --> 36:55.200
  <i>YOU COULD BE THE KEY,
  <i>SPARKY.</i></i>

36:55.300 --> 36:56.501
 <i>I'M SOAKING WET.</i>

36:56.601 --> 36:59.234
 <i>WELL, YOU BETTER DRY
 <i>YOUR ASS OFF, FAST.</i></i>

37:19.868 --> 37:21.534
SHALIMAR!

37:36.100 --> 37:38.000
  BRENNAN, GET HER!
  IT'S ME!

37:38.100 --> 37:39.567
SHE'S LYING!

37:42.267 --> 37:44.634
 BRENNAN, DO IT NOW!

37:52.834 --> 37:54.667
 HOW'D YOU KNOW
  IT WAS ME?

37:54.767 --> 37:57.033
 I FIGURED I HAD
 A 50/50 CHANCE.

37:57.133 --> 37:58.200
OH, COME ON,

37:58.300 --> 37:59.200
I'M NOT GOING TO
GET YOU CONFUSED

37:59.300 --> 38:00.534
 WITH SOME CHEAP
  IMITATION?

38:00.634 --> 38:02.033
 WHAT YOU
 TALKING ABOUT?

38:02.133 --> 38:03.634
COME ON.

38:10.601 --> 38:12.501
WHERE IS HE?

38:12.601 --> 38:14.267
 HE'S IN THE HOT TUB.

38:14.367 --> 38:16.234
 GO.

38:29.234 --> 38:33.067
DAMN, HE'S ONE
 OF THEM, TOO?

38:33.167 --> 38:35.734
I THINK IT'S TIME WE PULLED THE
 PLUG ON THE REAL RINGLEADER.

38:35.834 --> 38:37.601
  YEAH.

39:10.267 --> 39:11.567
 <gasp!>

39:14.200 --> 39:15.767
OKAY.

39:15.868 --> 39:16.801
LEXA?

39:16.901 --> 39:18.033
LEXA, YOU ALL RIGHT?

39:18.133 --> 39:19.234
  JESS.

39:19.334 --> 39:20.567
 OKAY, JUST STAY
WITH ME, ALL RIGHT?

39:20.667 --> 39:22.767
WE'RE GOING TO GET
 YOU OUT OF HERE.

39:25.834 --> 39:28.567
MOVE AND SHE'S DEAD.

39:28.667 --> 39:30.434
 AHH...

39:30.534 --> 39:34.067
 YOU MUST BE THE BRAINS
 OF THE OPERATION.

39:34.167 --> 39:35.567
  NOLAN BLACKLEDGE.

39:35.667 --> 39:37.234
THAT'S RIGHT.
 YEAH. YEAH.

39:37.334 --> 39:38.734
SO WHO'S SEBASTIAN?

39:38.834 --> 39:40.634
 YOUR ALTER EGO?

39:40.734 --> 39:42.067
  SEBASTIAN?

39:42.167 --> 39:44.901
 HE'S JUST PART OF THE
 WHOLE NERO'S MYSTIQUE.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.701
YOU CREATED HIM.

39:46.801 --> 39:47.868
 AS YOUR FRONT MAN.

39:47.968 --> 39:49.033
I MEAN, HE'S EVERYTHING
YOU'RE NOT, RIGHT?

39:49.133 --> 39:50.734
  CONFIDENT,
 CHARISMATIC...

39:50.834 --> 39:53.300
  SEBASTIAN SERVES
 HIS PURPOSE.

39:53.400 --> 39:55.601
WELL, YOU WON'T HAVE HIM
  TO HIDE BEHIND ANY LONGER.

39:55.701 --> 39:57.367
YEAH, HE DONE BLOWED UP.

40:07.334 --> 40:09.734
  HEY, GIA.

40:09.834 --> 40:11.801
GIA.

40:14.067 --> 40:15.100
SHALIMAR?

40:15.200 --> 40:16.634
 HEY, IT'S OVER.

40:16.734 --> 40:18.634
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
I WAS GETTING INTO.

40:18.734 --> 40:20.934
 I KNOW.

40:21.033 --> 40:22.667
 IT'S GOING
 TO BE OKAY.

40:22.767 --> 40:24.567
 I PROMISE.

40:32.534 --> 40:33.467
 HEY, THERE,
 SUNSHINE.

40:33.567 --> 40:34.734
 YOU FEELING
 ANY BETTER?

40:34.834 --> 40:35.767
YEAH.

40:35.868 --> 40:36.934
YOU'D BE AMAZED HOW
REFRESHED YOU FEEL

40:37.033 --> 40:38.367
AFTER 20 HOURS
  OF SLEEP.

40:38.467 --> 40:40.667
YEAH, WELL, IT'S A PRETTY
STRONG SEDATIVE THEY GAVE YOU,

40:40.767 --> 40:43.667
YEAH. JUST MY LUCK. I GOT TO
 SLEEP THROUGH ALL THE FUN.

40:43.767 --> 40:45.200
  EH, YOU DIDN'T MISS MUCH.

40:45.300 --> 40:48.334
SO, DID I BEHAVE
 MYSELF?

40:48.434 --> 40:51.234
  OH, YEAH, YOU
WERE GOOD.

40:51.334 --> 40:52.868
YOU WERE...

40:52.968 --> 40:55.234
REALLY GOOD.

40:56.534 --> 40:58.000
 YEAH, RIGHT...
YOU WISH.

40:59.467 --> 41:02.868
THAT'S A NICE, UH,
 TATTOO YOU HAVE.

41:02.968 --> 41:05.334
  JESSE! GET BACK HERE!

41:05.434 --> 41:06.801
 YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME
EVERYTHING THAT WENT ON!

41:06.901 --> 41:08.167
 JESSE!

41:08.267 --> 41:10.334
  EVERYTHING!
 DO YOU HEAR ME!

41:10.434 --> 41:12.133
  JESS!

41:16.334 --> 41:17.767
 HEY, THERE.

41:17.868 --> 41:20.167
HEY. WHERE YOU BEEN?

41:20.267 --> 41:22.334
  I SET GIA UP WITH
  A PLACE TO STAY.

41:22.434 --> 41:23.934
 GAVE HER SOME CASH
  TO TIDE HER OVER

41:24.033 --> 41:25.234
 'TIL SHE FOUND
 A JOB.

41:25.334 --> 41:26.334
SHAL. I JUST ...

41:26.434 --> 41:27.734
 LOOK, I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO SAY.

41:27.834 --> 41:28.934
 I KNOW I'M NOT
 A SUPER-HERO.

41:29.033 --> 41:30.767
I CAN'T SAVE
 EVERYONE.

41:30.868 --> 41:31.868
NO, NO...

41:31.968 --> 41:34.167
ACTUALLY I WAS GOING
TO SAY THAT I'M SORRY.

41:34.267 --> 41:36.734
 I SHOULDN'T HAVE ASSUMED
ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR FRIEND.

41:36.834 --> 41:38.367
PEOPLE CAN CHANGE.

41:38.467 --> 41:41.834
AND I JUST HOPE THAT SHE
 KEEPS HER ACT TOGETHER.

41:41.934 --> 41:43.701
  YEAH, ME TOO.

41:45.267 --> 41:46.834
 GOD, IT JUST MAKES
  ME SICK,

41:46.934 --> 41:50.067
 A PLACE LIKE NERO'S
 EVEN EXISTS TODAY.

41:50.167 --> 41:51.200
YEAH.

41:51.300 --> 41:52.901
WELL, IT'S MAN'S PURSUIT
OF THE PERFECT WOMAN.

41:53.000 --> 41:56.100
IT'S BEEN GOING ON SINCE
 THE BEGINNING OF TIME.

41:56.200 --> 41:58.734
 YEAH, WELL, MAN SHOULD
 GET OVER HIS DAMN SELF.

41:58.834 --> 42:03.067
 WOMEN ARE PERFECT
 JUST THE WAY THEY ARE.

42:06.667 --> 42:08.701
 YEAH...
