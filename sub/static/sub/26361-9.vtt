00:04.265 --> 00:04.482
.

00:04.526 --> 00:06.484
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:06.528 --> 00:07.790
sexually based offenses

00:07.833 --> 00:09.487
are considered
especially heinous.

00:09.531 --> 00:11.707
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:11.750 --> 00:13.578
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:13.622 --> 00:15.145
are members of an elite squad

00:15.189 --> 00:17.060
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.888
These are their stories.

00:20.063 --> 00:22.500
- The defendant has means
and reason to flee, Your Honor.

00:22.544 --> 00:24.372
He's facing 25 years
on Rape One.

00:24.415 --> 00:27.592
- My client is eager to go
to trial and clear his name.

00:27.636 --> 00:30.682
- This is ridiculous.
It was consensual.

00:30.726 --> 00:32.032
She never said "No."

00:32.075 --> 00:34.643
- The victim's blood alcohol
was 0.23.

00:34.686 --> 00:36.079
- We were both drunk.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.167
- That's it, Mr. Madden.

00:37.211 --> 00:38.386
Mr. Stone, I'm granting

00:38.429 --> 00:39.735
your request for a remand.

00:42.259 --> 00:44.348
- You're going to jail, sir.

00:51.225 --> 00:53.357
You believe me?

00:53.401 --> 00:55.490
I never wanted that,
not with him.

00:55.533 --> 00:56.882
- I do.

00:56.926 --> 00:59.711
- We'll be in touch
about your testimony, okay?

01:01.757 --> 01:04.107
- Well done.

01:04.151 --> 01:05.761
- She was afraid
he was gonna get out on bail.

01:05.804 --> 01:08.111
Amazing, get a remand
on the he-said, she-said.

01:08.155 --> 01:09.852
- Yeah. Moral,
don't piss off the judge.

01:11.158 --> 01:12.115
I can download you
on where we are

01:12.159 --> 01:13.464
on the investigation.

01:13.508 --> 01:15.205
- Yeah, I do, but I'm trying
to slow it down.

01:15.249 --> 01:16.554
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Have a good night, okay?

01:16.598 --> 01:18.730
- All right.

01:19.949 --> 01:21.864
Tad.

01:21.907 --> 01:23.909
Hey. The works.

01:23.953 --> 01:25.868
- Oh, my God.

01:25.911 --> 01:27.043
It is you.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.218
Peter Stone.

01:29.872 --> 01:30.829
- You pitched for the Cubs.

01:30.873 --> 01:31.830
- I did.

01:31.874 --> 01:32.875
- Grew up in Chicago.

01:32.918 --> 01:35.007
My dad took me to every game.

01:35.051 --> 01:36.661
- That's a lot
of baseball games.

01:36.705 --> 01:37.662
Thank you.

01:37.706 --> 01:38.663
- I can't believe it.

01:38.707 --> 01:40.317
I have to call my dad.

01:41.623 --> 01:45.061
Any chance I could
buy you a drink?

01:45.105 --> 01:47.019
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:47.063 --> 01:48.020
Here you go, Tad.

01:48.064 --> 01:49.021
Thanks.

01:49.065 --> 01:50.022
I happen to know a place

01:50.066 --> 01:52.373
right around the corner.

01:52.416 --> 01:54.810
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

01:54.853 --> 01:56.420
- It's delicious.

01:56.464 --> 01:59.771
Now I know what all
the truffle fuss is about.

01:59.815 --> 02:01.599
- Italian white truffles
in November.

02:01.643 --> 02:03.514
If you say so.

02:03.558 --> 02:05.995
We weren't big on
truffle risotto in Georgia.

02:06.038 --> 02:07.257
- Yeah, more like
shrimp and grits.

02:07.301 --> 02:09.955
- Yeah. Oh, you've been
listening.

02:09.999 --> 02:12.262
- So what looks good
for dessert?

02:12.306 --> 02:14.438
- Oh...

02:14.482 --> 02:17.006
I can't decide.
Cherry blossom soufflé

02:17.049 --> 02:20.488
or bittersweet chocolate?

02:22.011 --> 02:24.927
- Or, better idea...

02:26.233 --> 02:27.408
- We'll have one of
everything.

02:27.451 --> 02:29.192
Every dessert on the menu.
And coffee.

02:29.236 --> 02:31.238
Decaf for the lady.

02:31.281 --> 02:32.630
- Very good, sir.

02:32.674 --> 02:34.023
- Thank you.

02:34.066 --> 02:36.547
A girl could get used to this.

02:36.591 --> 02:39.246
- I have something
to ask you.

02:40.421 --> 02:43.685
A commitment I have
never made before.

02:52.520 --> 02:55.523
- When I said I was happy...
- Just hear me out.

02:57.046 --> 03:00.223
Amanda Rollins, will you...

03:00.267 --> 03:01.703
Go ahead.

03:08.971 --> 03:09.972
- It's a key.

03:14.324 --> 03:16.152
- I was in awe of you.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.414
Between that rising fastball,

03:17.458 --> 03:18.850
your curveball, your change up,

03:18.894 --> 03:21.026
and the fact that you could
swing a bat too.

03:21.070 --> 03:22.854
I mean, for a pitcher.

03:22.898 --> 03:25.335
Oh, gee, thanks.

03:25.379 --> 03:27.207
Hey, do you, do you want
another one?

03:27.250 --> 03:28.512
- Yeah, I do.

03:28.556 --> 03:31.254
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'll be right back.

I don't, I really,
I really don't.

Nice place.

how you got here?

You were messed up.

05:52.743 --> 05:56.443
She looked at me
like she'd seen a ghost.

05:56.486 --> 05:58.358
And then she hauled off
and hit me.

05:58.401 --> 06:00.011
Accused me of assaulting her.

against the Mets.

06:08.498 --> 06:12.023
And a few of the guys decided
to go to a bar after.

06:12.067 --> 06:14.548
There was this--
there was this woman there.

06:14.591 --> 06:17.246
- Right.

06:17.289 --> 06:20.597
I was drunk.
We all were.

06:20.641 --> 06:24.427
A few of us decided to go
back to my hotel room.

06:24.471 --> 06:26.908
Things got a little crazy.

06:26.951 --> 06:28.431
I remember

06:28.475 --> 06:30.390
she and I were going at it

06:30.433 --> 06:33.393
pretty hot and heavy,
and then...

06:33.436 --> 06:34.872
I woke up.

06:34.916 --> 06:37.701
In my bed, alone.
Everyone was gone.

06:41.401 --> 06:44.360
- I called her the next day
and she...

06:44.404 --> 06:47.363
she said...

06:47.407 --> 06:49.104
"Try to talk to me again

06:49.147 --> 06:50.453
and I'm going to the police."

06:51.759 --> 06:54.936
- No, I was never contacted.

06:54.979 --> 06:57.025
- Okay.

06:57.068 --> 06:59.506
You're telling me
that you were drinking.

06:59.549 --> 07:00.594
You were acting crazy.

07:00.637 --> 07:01.682
All right, you sure this

07:01.725 --> 07:02.639
is all that happened?

07:02.683 --> 07:03.640
You're not lying to me?

07:03.684 --> 07:04.902
Don't lie to me, man.

07:04.946 --> 07:06.251
- I'm not.
- Tell me the truth.

07:06.295 --> 07:07.252
- I am telling you the truth.

07:07.296 --> 07:09.037
I'm not lying to you.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.910
I might not
remember everything

07:12.954 --> 07:17.175
but I know I didn't
rape anyone.

07:20.352 --> 07:21.484
I need to talk to her.

07:21.528 --> 07:23.573
Find out what the hell's
going on.

07:23.617 --> 07:25.575
- Alicia, your statement
was very helpful.

07:25.619 --> 07:27.229
- I still can't remember
much about that night.

07:27.272 --> 07:29.274
I mean, I've tried, but--
- Sometimes our memory

07:29.318 --> 07:30.580
comes back in bits and pieces.

07:30.624 --> 07:31.929
- Sometimes not at all.

07:31.973 --> 07:33.540
- But this still goes
to trial--

07:33.583 --> 07:35.106
- Yes, we know from your
blood alcohol content

07:35.150 --> 07:36.934
that you were clearly
incapable of consent.

07:36.978 --> 07:38.588
- So if anything
comes back to you,

07:38.632 --> 07:40.677
anything at all,
you give us a call, okay?

07:40.721 --> 07:43.463
- Okay.
- Anytime.

07:43.506 --> 07:45.552
Walk her out, thanks.

07:45.595 --> 07:47.858
So have TARU go over
the security footage

07:47.902 --> 07:49.251
from her apartment building.

07:49.294 --> 07:52.646
Anything that shows that
she was incapacitated.

07:55.518 --> 07:56.780
- There he is.

07:56.824 --> 08:00.392
- Oh, look who the cat
dragged in!

08:00.436 --> 08:01.742
Oh, man!

08:01.785 --> 08:02.960
- Hey, Reggie, long time.
How are you?

08:03.004 --> 08:04.048
- Man, too long.

08:04.092 --> 08:05.833
Heard a rumor you moved
to New York.

08:05.876 --> 08:07.312
What, you're too good
for your old stomping grounds

08:07.356 --> 08:08.836
now you're a DA?

08:08.879 --> 08:10.402
- No, we've been
keeping him busy.

08:10.446 --> 08:12.317
Detective Tutuola, NYPD.

08:12.361 --> 08:14.537
- Whoa, wait, I'm not
in some kind of trouble, am I?

08:14.581 --> 08:16.104
- No, no, not at all.

08:16.147 --> 08:17.322
But you got a minute?

08:17.366 --> 08:18.498
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
sit down, sit down.

08:18.541 --> 08:20.021
Thank you.

08:20.064 --> 08:21.631
- Oh, hey, can I--
can I get you guys something?

08:21.675 --> 08:24.068
- No, I'm okay.

08:24.112 --> 08:27.855
So...do you remember
August, 2006?

08:27.898 --> 08:30.771
I had a no-hitter going until
you stepped up to the plate?

08:30.814 --> 08:31.946
- We had some fun that night.

08:31.989 --> 08:33.208
- Yeah, actually, that's what

08:33.251 --> 08:34.426
I wanted to ask you about.

08:34.470 --> 08:35.645
- We're trying to locate
a woman

08:35.689 --> 08:37.821
that came to the bar
after that game.

08:37.865 --> 08:40.998
- She was blonde and I think
her name was Sarah.

08:41.042 --> 08:43.566
You and me, we were talking
with her and a friend of hers.

08:43.610 --> 08:45.699
Big brown eyes, legs for days.

08:45.742 --> 08:47.004
- Went back to your hotel room,

08:47.048 --> 08:49.006
had a couple of fifths
of Silver Patron,

08:49.050 --> 08:50.834
Dom Perignon.

08:50.878 --> 08:52.183
Room Service loved us.

08:52.227 --> 08:54.621
- Right, so you do remember.

08:54.664 --> 08:57.841
- I remember everything.

08:57.885 --> 08:59.539
Here, come on.
I'll show you.

09:04.413 --> 09:07.285
Big brown eyes?
I married her.

09:07.329 --> 09:08.765
Wanda.
We got two kids.

09:08.809 --> 09:10.375
And yes, in case
you're wondering,

09:10.419 --> 09:12.029
she still has got the legs.

09:12.073 --> 09:15.163
- You think Wanda may still
be in contact with Sarah?

09:15.946 --> 09:17.992
Sarah Kent,
address in Bushwick.

09:18.035 --> 09:19.994
You sure this is her?
- Yeah, that's her.

09:20.037 --> 09:21.735
- You sure you want me
to talk to her?

09:21.778 --> 09:24.389
- I am. Whatever she thinks
I did, she's wrong.

09:24.433 --> 09:25.565
- Kay.

09:25.608 --> 09:26.870
Do me a favor.

09:26.914 --> 09:29.046
Don't tell Liv. Not yet.

09:46.673 --> 09:48.022
- Yes.

09:48.065 --> 09:50.764
- I'm Detective Tutuola, NYPD.

09:50.807 --> 09:53.897
Do you know a Peter Stone?

09:55.856 --> 09:58.293
- Uh, Jehovah's Witness.

09:59.816 --> 10:02.906
Yes, yes, I know Peter Stone.

10:02.950 --> 10:05.648
I don't ever want to hear
that name again.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.389
Okay?

10:07.432 --> 10:09.304
Don't come back.

10:26.321 --> 10:26.495

10:26.538 --> 10:28.584
- Hey, I'm going to the deli.
You want anything?

10:28.628 --> 10:29.803
- No, I'm good.

10:29.846 --> 10:31.282
- All right.
Steak for lunch, huh?

10:31.326 --> 10:32.849
I guess you are good.

10:32.893 --> 10:34.242
- It was leftovers.

10:34.285 --> 10:36.374
Al always over-orders.

10:36.418 --> 10:38.376
How are things going
with the good doctor?

10:38.420 --> 10:41.249
Using the term "good"
pretty loosely here.

10:41.292 --> 10:43.947
- He asked me to move in
with him.

10:45.296 --> 10:47.168
- Well, I hope
you told him no.

10:47.211 --> 10:48.604
- I told him that
I'd think about it.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.127
What, you're telling me

10:50.171 --> 10:52.042
you trust this guy now?
After he lied to you?

10:52.086 --> 10:53.304
This is what you want?

10:53.348 --> 10:55.698
- I don't know
what I want, Carisi.

10:55.742 --> 10:56.699
I do know what I don't want.

10:56.743 --> 10:57.744
I don't want me

10:57.787 --> 10:58.919
and this new baby and Jesse

10:58.962 --> 11:00.572
and Frannie all crammed

11:00.616 --> 11:03.271
into my tiny two-bedroom
apartment.

11:06.927 --> 11:08.058
- No.

11:08.102 --> 11:09.494
- No, I'm just--
you know what,

11:09.538 --> 11:11.540
if I wanted
a "why buy the cow" speech

11:11.583 --> 11:12.628
I'd call my mother.

11:12.672 --> 11:13.890
- You know, Rollins,
I'm just saying

11:13.934 --> 11:15.109
that you deserve to be happy.

11:15.152 --> 11:16.719
You deserve to be
taken care of.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.068
- And Al takes care of me.

11:18.112 --> 11:20.157
- No he doesn't.
Look, there is a difference

11:20.201 --> 11:21.768
between flowers
and fancy-ass dinners

11:21.811 --> 11:23.465
and being taken care of.
- People can change.

11:23.508 --> 11:24.945
- I'll believe that
when I see it.

11:24.988 --> 11:26.686
- Okay.

11:26.729 --> 11:28.644
- Hey, I'm gonna get you
a ginger ale, all right?

11:28.688 --> 11:31.603
That steak's gonna
give you indigestion.

11:31.647 --> 11:33.475
- We have a bit of time
before the trial.

11:33.518 --> 11:35.129
And I'll begin
with an opening statement.

11:36.260 --> 11:37.740
- Soon.
You'll be great.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.655
- You know, we have a room
that you can wait in.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.222
- All right, come with me.
- Okay.

11:41.265 --> 11:42.353
- Thanks, Carmen.

11:42.397 --> 11:43.485
You prepped her testimony?

11:43.528 --> 11:45.182
- Yeah, backwards
and forwards.

11:45.226 --> 11:46.183
- You think she'll do
all right on the stand?

11:46.227 --> 11:47.402
- Well, I hope so.

11:47.445 --> 11:48.577
There's a lot
she doesn't remember.

11:48.620 --> 11:50.013
Defense is gonna
go after her hard.

11:50.057 --> 11:51.406
- Okay, well,
what about a plea?

11:51.449 --> 11:52.886
- They already tried to get
the case dismissed

11:52.929 --> 11:54.801
alleging that the defendant
was too drunk to consent.

11:56.367 --> 11:58.979
So what, she's making
this all up?

11:59.022 --> 12:00.763
Because what woman
wouldn't want to go

12:00.807 --> 12:03.244
through the trauma
of a rape investigation,

12:03.287 --> 12:05.725
a trial, just for kicks?

12:07.901 --> 12:10.033
He's guilty, Peter.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.951
Are you okay?

12:14.995 --> 12:16.257
- Yeah.

12:16.300 --> 12:19.216
Yeah, I'm fine.
Just trouble sleeping.

12:25.527 --> 12:27.703
- I got to the bar around 11:30

12:27.747 --> 12:29.313
and then the last thing
I remember,

12:29.357 --> 12:31.925
Roger Madden walked me home.

12:31.968 --> 12:33.883
I said I didn't
need help but

12:33.927 --> 12:35.145
he didn't listen.

12:36.277 --> 12:38.279
- I woke up the next morning.

12:38.322 --> 12:39.802
My clothes were torn off.

12:42.196 --> 12:43.980
- I went to the hospital.

12:44.024 --> 12:45.677
For a rape kit.

12:45.721 --> 12:47.244
The nurse called SVU.

12:47.288 --> 12:48.855
The detective said
I'd been assaulted.

12:48.898 --> 12:52.075
- But you never completely
remembered the assault itself?

12:52.119 --> 12:54.251
- No.

12:54.295 --> 12:56.688
I do remember telling him
earlier that evening

12:56.732 --> 12:58.560
that I didn't want
to go home with him.

12:58.603 --> 13:00.867
- You let me buy you drinks
all night.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.433
- Mr. Madden, that's enough.

13:02.477 --> 13:05.045
One more outburst,
I will hold you in contempt.

13:05.088 --> 13:06.568
- I apologize, Your Honor.

13:06.611 --> 13:08.222
- Mr. Stone.
- Your Honor.

13:08.265 --> 13:10.050
Please continue, Ms. Beck.

13:10.093 --> 13:12.356
- I didn't want
to go home with him.

13:13.705 --> 13:17.448
I would have never
consented to sex.

13:17.492 --> 13:18.667
Never.

13:21.104 --> 13:22.627
- Thank you, Ms. Beck.

13:25.108 --> 13:26.196
- Earlier that evening,

13:26.240 --> 13:27.241
did you consent

13:27.284 --> 13:28.590
to have a drink with my client?

13:28.633 --> 13:29.460
- Yes.

13:29.504 --> 13:30.592
- Did you consent to having

13:30.635 --> 13:31.854
several drinks with my client

13:31.898 --> 13:33.725
while flirting with him for,

13:33.769 --> 13:35.553
according to the bartender,
over an hour?

13:35.597 --> 13:37.860
- Yes, but I didn't--
- Yes, but what, you...

13:37.904 --> 13:40.602
remember consenting to have
drinks with my client

13:40.645 --> 13:42.909
but you don't remember
consenting to the sex?

13:42.952 --> 13:45.085
- Objection.
- Overruled.

13:45.128 --> 13:46.738
- I'm not making this up.

13:46.782 --> 13:49.045
I wouldn't be sitting here
if I wasn't raped.

13:49.089 --> 13:50.481
- We just heard you testify

13:50.525 --> 13:52.309
that you don't remember
what happened

13:52.353 --> 13:55.791
between walking home
and waking up.

13:55.835 --> 13:56.923
You could have consented

13:56.966 --> 13:59.490
and not remember
that you consented.

14:02.015 --> 14:04.452
- You tell me.

14:04.495 --> 14:07.063
- Roger Madden raped me.

14:07.107 --> 14:08.848
I'm only here because I believe

14:08.891 --> 14:13.809
if I can face the man
who raped me,

14:13.853 --> 14:15.376
if I can get justice,

14:15.419 --> 14:17.857
I'll somehow get my life back.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.045
- Peter.
- Hey.

14:35.439 --> 14:37.006
- Uh, sure, come in.

14:37.050 --> 14:38.529
- Thanks.

14:40.314 --> 14:41.750
- Look, I'm just gonna

14:41.793 --> 14:43.186
come out and say it.

14:43.230 --> 14:45.667
I've been accused
of sexual assault.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.715
- It was 12 years ago.

14:50.759 --> 14:53.066
I was drunk.

14:53.109 --> 14:55.155
Look, but I know

14:55.198 --> 14:56.504
in my bones

14:56.547 --> 14:58.201
in my heart and in my soul

14:58.245 --> 15:00.160
I didn't rape this woman.

15:00.203 --> 15:02.684
- But she says you did.

15:02.727 --> 15:04.077
Why?

15:04.120 --> 15:05.774
- I don't know.

15:05.817 --> 15:07.123
What I do know

15:07.167 --> 15:08.168
is no matter how drunk I was,

15:08.211 --> 15:09.909
that's not who I am.

15:14.217 --> 15:16.176
I swear to God.

15:16.219 --> 15:17.960
I didn't do this, Liv.

15:18.004 --> 15:19.875
I didn't do this.

15:23.183 --> 15:24.793
You believe me?

15:27.143 --> 15:28.928
- I do.

15:30.668 --> 15:32.322
I do, but...

15:33.454 --> 15:37.327
But Peter, it's just
not that simple.

15:37.371 --> 15:38.894
- Because it's your job
to believe her.

15:38.938 --> 15:42.942
- It's my job to hear her side
of the story.

15:42.985 --> 15:46.206
To find out the truth.

15:46.249 --> 15:47.772
So...

15:47.816 --> 15:51.863
if you want someone to make
this go away, then...

15:53.039 --> 15:54.997
You came to the wrong person.

15:55.041 --> 15:57.869
- No, I'm not asking you
to make this go away.

15:57.913 --> 16:00.437
I want the truth too.

16:02.091 --> 16:04.441
I'm not asking for absolution.

16:05.529 --> 16:08.968
I'm asking that you open
an investigation.

16:17.715 --> 16:17.889
.

16:17.933 --> 16:19.456
- Way things are now,

16:19.500 --> 16:20.457
we're all looking at our past

16:20.501 --> 16:21.458
through a new prism.

16:21.502 --> 16:22.851
- Come on.

16:22.894 --> 16:24.157
We're talking
about Peter Stone here.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.767
All right? There's a big
difference between

16:25.810 --> 16:27.247
buying a woman another drink
at the bar

16:27.290 --> 16:28.465
and, and felony rape.

16:29.901 --> 16:31.468
- We were all young
and stupid, Amanda.

16:31.512 --> 16:32.861
- In my personal experience,

16:32.904 --> 16:35.907
age has nothing to do with it.

16:38.736 --> 16:40.695
I mean, cards
on the table, Fin.

16:40.738 --> 16:43.350
Did he do it?

16:43.393 --> 16:46.353
- She definitely believes
he did something.

16:46.396 --> 16:48.094
- Of course she does,
but he's our friend

16:48.137 --> 16:50.183
and he said it absolutely
did not happen.

16:50.226 --> 16:51.488
No chance.

16:51.532 --> 16:52.968
- Okay.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.579
We all realize that this sucks.

16:55.623 --> 16:57.755
- Yeah, you know
what sucks, Rollins?

16:57.799 --> 16:59.192
This is what sucks.

16:59.235 --> 17:01.759
A busload of nuns could say
that Peter Stone

17:01.803 --> 17:03.152
was in Albuquerque

17:03.196 --> 17:04.588
at the time of this rape.

17:04.632 --> 17:07.069
And still, somewhere
in the back of my mind,

17:07.113 --> 17:09.245
every time I see him
I'm gonna wonder.

17:09.289 --> 17:12.205
Did he?

17:12.248 --> 17:13.945
That's what sucks.

17:15.295 --> 17:17.253
- And we know him.

17:18.776 --> 17:20.996
- Hi. Olivia Benson, SVU.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.476
- I already told
that other detective

17:22.519 --> 17:23.651
that I don't want
to talk about this.

17:23.694 --> 17:25.522
- I understand that, but

17:25.566 --> 17:26.741
a crime has been reported,

17:26.784 --> 17:28.395
and as an officer of the law

17:28.438 --> 17:30.658
I have to investigate him.

17:35.880 --> 17:39.275
- He did. He asked me
to investigate.

17:40.755 --> 17:43.149
- This isn't gonna go away,
is it?

17:48.632 --> 17:50.286
All right. Come in.

17:54.464 --> 17:55.639
Look, it was a long time ago.

17:55.683 --> 17:58.425
- Okay, so just try
to remember.

17:58.468 --> 18:00.253
- We were both drinking.

18:00.296 --> 18:01.776
- Okay.

18:01.819 --> 18:04.779
So if you were
too intoxicated to consent,

18:04.822 --> 18:07.042
or you had sex
against your will--

18:09.044 --> 18:10.567
Can we just drop this?

18:10.611 --> 18:12.961
I don't--
- Hey, hey!

18:13.004 --> 18:14.354
- Hey.

18:14.397 --> 18:15.790
- Client canceled, the flu.

18:15.833 --> 18:17.357
I thought we could go to lunch.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.881
- Um...

18:19.924 --> 18:21.926
listen, Gary...

18:21.970 --> 18:24.668
Uh, the police are here.

18:24.712 --> 18:26.975
- I'm Lieutenant Benson.

18:28.629 --> 18:30.587
- No, no, no, no, Gary. No.

18:30.631 --> 18:34.548
Um...it's me.

18:34.591 --> 18:35.810
I'm sorry.

18:37.333 --> 18:40.162
- No, no, no, it's nothing
like that.

18:40.206 --> 18:42.338
- Look, it was
a long time ago, okay?

18:42.382 --> 18:43.470
It doesn't mean anything

18:43.513 --> 18:45.428
and I am not gonna
press charges.

18:45.472 --> 18:48.083
What the hell's
going on here?

18:51.217 --> 18:55.221
- Sarah may have been
sexually assaulted, Mr. Kent.

19:01.401 --> 19:03.577
- I'm sorry.

19:04.404 --> 19:06.362
- The hell we're not
pressing charges.

19:06.406 --> 19:08.016
Do you know who did it?

19:08.059 --> 19:09.191
- Please, Gary,
I don't want it.

19:09.235 --> 19:11.062
I just want to drop it.
Please.

19:16.416 --> 19:18.766
Then we're gonna do
whatever it takes

19:18.809 --> 19:22.073
to put this son of a bitch
in jail forever.

19:27.557 --> 19:30.734
- Hey, so Liv is on her way
here with Sarah Kent.

19:34.303 --> 19:35.957
You doing okay?

19:38.873 --> 19:40.527
- Rollins, I know that our job

19:40.570 --> 19:41.702
is to believe survivors.

19:41.745 --> 19:44.226
That we start from there.

19:44.270 --> 19:45.880
On this one,

19:45.923 --> 19:48.187
I believe him. I...

19:48.230 --> 19:50.363
- You're allowed
to feel that way.

19:50.406 --> 19:52.278
- I don't think that I am.

19:53.496 --> 19:54.889
Here, come on.

19:54.932 --> 19:56.847
- Oh, thank you.

19:56.891 --> 19:58.893
Hey, listen.

19:58.936 --> 20:00.155
You know, you were right
about me

20:00.199 --> 20:03.767
moving in with Al.
It's, uh...

20:03.811 --> 20:05.247
it's not my style.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.423
The square footage, the,
the fancy...

20:07.467 --> 20:08.642
- No, no, no.
- Japanese toilets.

20:08.685 --> 20:09.817
- Don't listen to me.

20:09.860 --> 20:10.992
Don't listen to me.

20:11.035 --> 20:12.254
You gotta do
what's right for you.

20:12.298 --> 20:15.779
For Jesse, for, for this
little baby.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.913
Also, I heard
those Japanese toilets?

20:18.956 --> 20:21.481
They're supposed to be
pretty spectacular.

20:27.008 --> 20:28.618
- We're gonna go
right this way.

20:28.662 --> 20:31.099
Around the corner.
Thanks.

20:31.142 --> 20:33.536
- I was a Mets fan,
and I found out

20:33.580 --> 20:35.408
that some of the players
went to this bar.

20:35.451 --> 20:37.148
- Well, there's nothing wrong
with that.

20:37.192 --> 20:38.672
- No, I still feel guilty.

20:38.715 --> 20:40.021
My husband and I were

20:40.064 --> 20:41.849
going through a rough patch
at the time.

20:41.892 --> 20:43.633
- Where was your husband
that night?

20:43.677 --> 20:46.854
- He was in Hawaii
on a golfing trip with his dad.

20:48.682 --> 20:51.206
But Peter Stone was so nice.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.469
- Well, Sarah, why don't
you walk us through

20:53.513 --> 20:56.211
exactly what happened
that night.

20:56.255 --> 20:59.606
- We were having fun.
We were, we were,

20:59.649 --> 21:02.783
drinking and dancing.

21:02.826 --> 21:05.829
We were flirting, and...

21:05.873 --> 21:08.441
a few of the players
and some of the girls,

21:08.484 --> 21:11.357
we decided to go
to Peter's hotel room.

21:11.400 --> 21:14.273
- And what happened when
you got to the room?

21:16.318 --> 21:18.494
- I remember kissing Peter.

21:20.540 --> 21:22.629
And it was okay at first,

21:22.672 --> 21:24.979
but then he...

21:25.022 --> 21:27.634
He became different.

21:27.677 --> 21:29.070
Maybe it was the tequila, or...

21:29.113 --> 21:31.812
Different how?

21:31.855 --> 21:33.857
- Not as nice.

21:35.206 --> 21:38.558
- Okay, so,
what happened next?

21:38.601 --> 21:40.081
- Um...

21:40.124 --> 21:42.823
One of the guys and Peter,
we were on the bed.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.653
- I don't know.
I just remember Peter.

21:51.005 --> 21:53.224
- I must have passed out,
because I--

21:53.268 --> 21:56.140
I woke up and I was naked,

21:56.184 --> 21:58.621
and I knew that I had had sex,

21:58.665 --> 22:00.710
and Peter was on the bed.

22:00.754 --> 22:03.278
And I didn't say yes.

22:08.457 --> 22:10.851
- So, Sarah...

22:10.894 --> 22:13.636
are you saying that Peter Stone

22:13.680 --> 22:17.118
sexually assaulted you?

22:17.161 --> 22:20.687
- Yes, I didn't want
to have sex.

22:20.730 --> 22:22.123
Okay?

22:23.516 --> 22:26.432
I would never, ever
do that to Gary.

22:29.086 --> 22:33.090
My husband and I,
we're happy now, okay?

22:37.921 --> 22:40.402
- So what do you say
to dopes like me?

22:42.448 --> 22:45.799
Guys that have no idea
their wives were raped?

22:45.842 --> 22:46.887
- Look, I'm sorry.

22:46.930 --> 22:48.236
I know this is--

22:48.279 --> 22:50.151
it's tough to go through.

22:50.194 --> 22:52.153
- She never told me.

22:54.895 --> 22:57.027
What does that mean?

22:57.071 --> 22:59.726
- I know it doesn't
mean that, uh,

22:59.769 --> 23:01.118
she doesn't love you.

23:01.162 --> 23:03.207
Doesn't mean
she doesn't trust you.

23:04.861 --> 23:07.168
- I was golfing at the time.

23:07.211 --> 23:08.648
I'll never forgive myself.

23:08.691 --> 23:09.736
I wasn't there to protect her.

23:09.779 --> 23:10.911
- Listen.

23:10.954 --> 23:13.914
You gotta think about her
right now.

23:13.957 --> 23:16.003
More than ever, right now.

23:16.046 --> 23:18.048
She needs your support.

23:18.092 --> 23:20.094
- Sarah and I were so in love.

23:20.137 --> 23:22.575
There's no way...

23:22.618 --> 23:26.753
- I know what you're thinking.

23:26.796 --> 23:28.668
She would never cheat on me.

23:36.589 --> 23:38.504
You want me to do it?

23:38.547 --> 23:41.420
- Like it's any easier
for you.

23:47.034 --> 23:49.079
- Yeah.

23:55.172 --> 23:58.088
- So we spoke with Sarah.

23:58.132 --> 23:59.873
- Hm.

23:59.916 --> 24:02.310
- She said that you raped her.

24:03.529 --> 24:07.054
- And her husband
wants to press charges.

24:12.451 --> 24:15.149
- Her story is credible, Peter.

24:17.194 --> 24:19.675
Because I know I didn't
rape anyone.

24:21.634 --> 24:24.985
- There were two people
in that room, and...

24:25.028 --> 24:27.509
I wasn't there.

24:27.553 --> 24:30.077
- And you said you believe me.

24:33.080 --> 24:35.386
- I also believe her.

24:37.171 --> 24:39.173
Look, Peter,
if this was anyone else

24:39.216 --> 24:41.610
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

24:44.221 --> 24:46.485
You're just gonna
arrest me now?

24:52.839 --> 24:54.405
- I have to.

24:58.540 --> 25:01.543
- If you want to call
a lawyer...

25:01.587 --> 25:03.240
- I am a lawyer.

25:31.268 --> 25:31.617
.

25:31.660 --> 25:32.879
- Hey, Lieutenant.

25:32.922 --> 25:34.315
Stone's been released, ROR.

25:34.358 --> 25:36.839
- Thanks. Yeah, I heard.

25:36.883 --> 25:38.275
- Is, um...

25:38.319 --> 25:39.886
Sarah gonna testify?

25:39.929 --> 25:42.584
- If she wants
to stay married, she is.

25:44.847 --> 25:47.328
Hey, Carisi, I hate
every minute of this too.

25:47.371 --> 25:50.853
But we don't get to pick
and choose who we investigate.

25:50.897 --> 25:52.942
- Lieutenant, he denies this.

25:52.986 --> 25:55.162
Maybe we owe him
the benefit of the doubt.

25:57.164 --> 26:00.689
What Sarah Kent described
was an assault.

26:00.733 --> 26:03.431
With all the self-blame
of not reporting,

26:03.474 --> 26:05.520
guilt about going to the bar,

26:05.564 --> 26:07.609
guilt about her marriage
falling apart--

26:07.653 --> 26:08.958
- Wha--hold on a second.

26:09.002 --> 26:10.873
She said her marriage
was falling apart?

26:10.917 --> 26:12.005
- She said that she
and her husband

26:12.048 --> 26:14.442
were going through
a rough patch.

26:14.485 --> 26:15.748
- All right,
that's interesting.

26:15.791 --> 26:17.271
Because the husband told me

26:17.314 --> 26:18.794
that they were madly in love.

26:18.838 --> 26:20.622
He's beating himself
up about this.

26:20.666 --> 26:22.145
He was out of town
at the time.

26:22.189 --> 26:23.930
She never told him about it.

26:27.150 --> 26:28.761
- Whatever's on tap.

26:34.070 --> 26:36.377
Look at us.

26:36.420 --> 26:38.901
Couple of guys having a beer.

26:40.555 --> 26:43.210
Oh, sorry, you don't know me.

26:43.253 --> 26:44.994
Gary Kent.

26:48.694 --> 26:50.521
- Look.

26:50.565 --> 26:52.567
Gary, for what it's worth,

26:52.611 --> 26:54.003
I didn't know.

26:54.047 --> 26:55.614
I didn't know Sarah
was married.

26:55.657 --> 26:57.877
- Hey, what are you gonna do,
you know?

26:57.920 --> 26:59.705
Pretty girl in a bar alone.

26:59.748 --> 27:02.185
- I didn't do anything
to your wife.

27:02.229 --> 27:04.666
- You were a ball player,
for crying out loud.

27:04.710 --> 27:06.189
Hell, that's what
you guys do, right?

27:06.233 --> 27:07.234
Different girl at every port?

27:07.277 --> 27:08.627
- I should go.

27:08.670 --> 27:10.933
- Least you can do
is have a drink with me.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.024
- Okay.

27:15.068 --> 27:16.547
- I tell you we met
in college,

27:16.591 --> 27:18.680
me and Sarah?

27:18.724 --> 27:20.856
I sat behind her in Poly Sci.

27:20.900 --> 27:23.642
She wore her hair long
back then too.

27:23.685 --> 27:25.556
She always wore it up, though.

27:25.600 --> 27:28.211
Said it was easier
than washing it.

27:28.255 --> 27:29.996
All I could think about
in that class,

27:30.039 --> 27:33.129
all I could focus on
was the back of Sarah's neck.

27:33.173 --> 27:36.611
To me that's the sexiest part
of a woman's body.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.352
Her bare neck.

27:38.395 --> 27:40.093
So let me ask you, uh,

27:40.136 --> 27:42.051
was her hair up?

27:42.095 --> 27:44.227
'Cause, like, if you took her
from behind, you know,

27:44.271 --> 27:46.099
and her hair was up--
- Hey, hey.

27:46.142 --> 27:47.622
Come on, fella.

27:49.276 --> 27:50.973
- Whoa, this guy!

27:51.017 --> 27:52.714
This guy played for the Cubs!

27:52.758 --> 27:54.629
- Easy.
- Starting pitcher!

27:54.673 --> 27:56.936
- Nobody cares, Gary.
- I care!

27:59.460 --> 28:02.724
This guy, in the nice suit?

28:02.768 --> 28:04.639
He raped my wife!

28:04.683 --> 28:06.510
- That's enough, guy.

28:06.554 --> 28:08.730
- Oh, you're right.
You're right.

28:08.774 --> 28:11.124
Nobody cares about my problems.

28:11.167 --> 28:12.734
I never played ball.

28:12.778 --> 28:14.736
- I'm gonna go.

28:14.780 --> 28:18.174
- Sit down and shut up.

28:23.049 --> 28:24.485
Sit!

28:24.528 --> 28:26.182
- Okay.

28:27.836 --> 28:29.272
- All right, everybody out.
Everybody out.

28:29.316 --> 28:31.187
- Go. Get out, man.

28:31.231 --> 28:32.623
- Come on.

28:32.667 --> 28:34.103
Me and the guy
who raped my wife,

28:34.147 --> 28:36.236
we're gonna have a little
heart-to-heart.

28:38.804 --> 28:41.937
Just a couple of guys with
one thing in common, huh?

28:41.981 --> 28:43.634
So what is it
with guys like you?

28:43.678 --> 28:45.593
You just see ass, you take it?

28:45.636 --> 28:47.856
- I may be a dick.

28:47.900 --> 28:49.989
But I am not a rapist.

28:50.032 --> 28:51.947
What are you saying?

28:51.991 --> 28:53.209
What are you saying
about my wife?

28:53.253 --> 28:55.472
Are you saying
the mother of my child,

28:55.516 --> 28:58.345
that she just hopped in
your bed of her own free will?

28:58.388 --> 29:00.826
- I don't remember.

29:00.869 --> 29:02.915
- Course you don't remember.
Of course.

29:02.958 --> 29:05.178
Just another nameless,
faceless piece of ass.

29:05.221 --> 29:06.005
- I never said that.

29:06.048 --> 29:07.310
- She doesn't mean anything

29:07.354 --> 29:08.964
to you, I get that.

29:13.534 --> 29:16.276
But to me?

29:16.319 --> 29:17.973
She's a goddess.

29:18.017 --> 29:19.714
- Right.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.585
- When she agreed to marry me,

29:21.629 --> 29:23.979
I almost passed out,
I was so happy.

29:26.852 --> 29:28.723
I couldn't protect her then.
But now...

29:28.767 --> 29:30.856
- Be smart, Gary.

29:30.899 --> 29:33.684
You let the justice system
work this out.

29:33.728 --> 29:35.686
- You don't get it.

29:35.730 --> 29:37.645
It's too late for justice.

29:37.688 --> 29:39.386
I want revenge.

29:41.867 --> 29:43.520
I want a world where
my little girl feels safe.

29:43.564 --> 29:44.783
- Right.

29:44.826 --> 29:46.741
- I want a world
without guys like you.

29:51.659 --> 29:52.834
- That's probably the cops.

29:52.878 --> 29:54.705
- Oh.

29:54.749 --> 29:56.490
Where are they
when you need them?

29:56.533 --> 29:58.274
- The last thing that you want

29:58.318 --> 30:00.059
right now

30:00.102 --> 30:02.975
is a SWAT team bursting
through that door.

30:04.672 --> 30:07.022
- Go ahead.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.475
- This is Peter Stone.

30:27.608 --> 30:29.305
- Montero!

30:29.349 --> 30:31.917
- Lieutenant, some guy's
got ADA Stone in there.

30:31.960 --> 30:32.961
The customer said he was
yelling about

30:33.005 --> 30:33.962
somebody raping his wife.

30:35.007 --> 30:36.399
- Best guess, a 9mm.

30:36.443 --> 30:38.053
- Somebody called me, my,
my husband's in the bar.

30:38.097 --> 30:39.881
No, no, no, you don't
understand!

30:39.925 --> 30:41.448
My husband is in that bar!
- Stay back, Miss.

30:41.491 --> 30:43.276
- Montero. Let 'em through,
let 'em through.

30:43.319 --> 30:46.105
How did Gary get a gun?

30:46.148 --> 30:48.281
- My daddy would never
hurt anybody.

30:48.324 --> 30:49.935
- I want you to come with me.
We're gonna get him out.

30:49.978 --> 30:52.763
Your daddy's gonna be okay.
Come with me.

30:52.807 --> 30:53.895
Are you the Borough Commander?

30:55.027 --> 30:56.506
- I'm Lieutenant Benson, SVU.

30:56.550 --> 30:57.812
This is my case.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.161
This is Mrs. Kent.

30:59.205 --> 31:01.163
Her husband is inside
with a gun.

31:01.207 --> 31:03.252
Maybe if she could
speak to him...

31:04.123 --> 31:05.602
What, what, I could--

31:05.646 --> 31:06.734
- Listen. Listen.

31:06.777 --> 31:07.778
You're gonna tell him

31:07.822 --> 31:09.955
that you love him, okay?

31:14.873 --> 31:17.440
- Okay, okay.
Okay.

31:23.316 --> 31:24.621
- Yeah.

31:24.665 --> 31:26.014
She's beautiful.

31:26.058 --> 31:28.277
- She's the reason
I get up every morning.

31:28.321 --> 31:29.409
- Right.

31:29.452 --> 31:30.932
- Sometimes I think

31:30.976 --> 31:32.934
if she didn't come along...

31:34.762 --> 31:36.459
Oh, screw it.

31:48.863 --> 31:50.212
It's Stone.

31:52.345 --> 31:53.476
Yeah.

31:55.522 --> 31:56.566
It's Sarah.

31:56.610 --> 31:58.264
She wants to talk to you.

32:00.701 --> 32:02.311
- Put it on the bar.

32:08.578 --> 32:10.929
What are you doing here?

32:10.972 --> 32:12.582
- Tell him, Sarah.
Tell him.

32:12.626 --> 32:14.541
Tell him.

32:16.543 --> 32:17.805
Gary, honey, I love you.

32:17.848 --> 32:20.199
I love you so much.

32:20.242 --> 32:22.418
We're gonna get through this
together, okay?

32:22.462 --> 32:23.376
I promise you.

32:23.419 --> 32:25.987
Just please don't hurt anybody.

32:26.031 --> 32:28.990
Please just don't hurt anybody.

32:29.034 --> 32:30.339
Emma's here.

32:30.383 --> 32:31.384
You wanna...

32:31.427 --> 32:32.559
Here.

32:36.606 --> 32:38.173
- Daddy, I love you.

32:38.217 --> 32:41.437
I love you so much.

32:41.481 --> 32:43.483
- I love you too.

32:45.050 --> 32:46.965
Put Mommy back on the phone.

32:51.795 --> 32:53.014
Gary.

32:53.058 --> 32:54.755
- I'm sorry.

32:54.798 --> 32:55.756
I gotta go.

32:55.799 --> 32:57.410
- No, no, no, no. Gary.

32:57.453 --> 33:00.369
- Hang it up. Hang it up.
- Okay, okay.

33:06.071 --> 33:07.637
- He hung up.

33:12.425 --> 33:14.514
- She brought Emma.
Why, what is--

33:14.557 --> 33:16.342
- Because she needs you.

33:17.778 --> 33:19.258
So does Sarah.

33:23.784 --> 33:25.612
You need to be there for them.

33:29.094 --> 33:30.573
They love you.

33:36.971 --> 33:39.234
- Daddy!

33:39.278 --> 33:40.322
Daddy!
- Emma, Emma!

33:40.366 --> 33:41.497
- It's gonna be okay, baby.

33:41.541 --> 33:42.977
It's okay, it's okay.
- Daddy!

33:43.021 --> 33:44.500
- It's gonna be okay.
It's fine.

33:44.544 --> 33:47.025
It's okay.
Everything's okay.

33:48.069 --> 33:49.070
- Coming out!

33:50.419 --> 33:51.942
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Nothing happened.

33:51.986 --> 33:54.293
- Come here.

33:54.336 --> 33:57.035
- I'm okay. I'm fine.
I'm fine.

34:09.438 --> 34:09.656
.

34:09.699 --> 34:10.787
- Liv.

34:10.831 --> 34:12.137
Talked to the 2-7.

34:12.180 --> 34:13.486
The gun's registered to one

34:13.529 --> 34:15.183
of Gary's construction crew.

34:15.227 --> 34:17.055
It wasn't loaded.

34:17.098 --> 34:19.013
- Stone didn't know that.

34:19.057 --> 34:21.450
He's not pressing charges.

34:21.494 --> 34:23.539
He is a good guy.

34:23.583 --> 34:27.848
- Who could be headed
to prison for Rape One.

34:27.891 --> 34:29.328
- Fin...

34:30.720 --> 34:33.071
Stone asked you to investigate.

34:33.114 --> 34:34.681
- Yeah he did.

34:34.724 --> 34:37.423
- Hey. The Department of Health
is on line one, Lieu.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.864
- That was fast.

34:43.907 --> 34:45.953
Yeah, Emma Jane Kent.

34:45.996 --> 34:47.955
What was her date of birth?

34:50.305 --> 34:52.568
- Feels like a lifetime ago.

34:52.612 --> 34:54.788
- You look so beautiful
and happy.

34:54.831 --> 34:57.225
- Yeah, I wish I still
had that hair.

34:57.269 --> 34:59.358
- You should have seen me
15 years ago.

34:59.401 --> 35:00.837
- That was a good guess.

35:00.881 --> 35:02.839
- Well, actually, Sarah,

35:02.883 --> 35:05.103
it wasn't a guess.

35:05.146 --> 35:06.887
I know

35:06.930 --> 35:08.758
that Emma was born

35:08.802 --> 35:12.284
8 1/2 months
after you were assaulted.

35:24.992 --> 35:26.428
- Gary and I were

35:26.472 --> 35:29.605
trying so hard to have a baby.

35:29.649 --> 35:31.868
We were in a really bad place.

35:31.912 --> 35:34.828
- So what happened
that night, Sarah?

35:34.871 --> 35:36.177
What happened?

35:36.221 --> 35:37.700
- Um...

35:39.311 --> 35:42.792
we were all partying,
you know, and...

35:44.098 --> 35:46.883
I, me, Wanda, and Reggie

35:46.927 --> 35:49.799
decided to go back
to Peter's hotel room.

35:51.323 --> 35:52.802
What happened?

35:52.846 --> 35:55.283
- Wanda left.

35:55.327 --> 35:59.287
And then I, I woke up,

35:59.331 --> 36:02.203
alone in the bed with Peter.

36:02.247 --> 36:03.683
And my clothes were off.

36:03.726 --> 36:06.164
- So the next morning
when Peter called, you just...

36:06.207 --> 36:07.556
assumed...

36:07.600 --> 36:10.777
- I just wanted that night
to disappear, and...

36:14.476 --> 36:16.826
but then six weeks later,

36:16.870 --> 36:20.178
I had a positive
pregnancy test.

36:20.221 --> 36:23.137
- Sarah, did you get
a DNA test?

36:23.181 --> 36:26.184
- No. I love Gary so much.

36:26.227 --> 36:29.056
I love him, and he...

36:29.099 --> 36:31.972
he wanted a baby so bad.

36:32.015 --> 36:35.062
And I just, I couldn't
tell him about that night.

36:35.105 --> 36:36.672
I couldn't do it.

36:36.716 --> 36:40.372
- Sarah, you say that you were
assaulted and I believe you.

36:40.415 --> 36:42.200
But are you sure...

36:42.243 --> 36:44.202
- That it was Peter Stone.

36:44.245 --> 36:46.204
He was the only person
in the room with me

36:46.247 --> 36:47.205
when I woke up.

36:47.248 --> 36:49.076
It had to have been him.

36:52.384 --> 36:55.343
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

36:55.387 --> 36:56.997
Stone is gonna go to prison?

36:57.040 --> 37:01.393
- Well, Sarah Kent tells
a convincing story.

37:02.785 --> 37:04.526
- It is.

37:04.570 --> 37:07.529
It could
be different, if...

37:07.573 --> 37:09.531
if somebody, if...

37:09.575 --> 37:13.100
you know, you said
that she consented.

37:16.321 --> 37:18.061
- You want me
to commit perjury?

37:18.105 --> 37:19.367
- Come on. I know

37:19.411 --> 37:22.370
that you guys cover
for each other.

37:22.414 --> 37:23.850
Right, all those road trips,

37:23.893 --> 37:27.767
what the wife and
the girlfriend don't know...

37:27.810 --> 37:29.986
I mean all you would have to do

37:30.030 --> 37:31.901
is to say

37:31.945 --> 37:34.556
that you heard

37:34.600 --> 37:37.820
Sarah consent
before you left the hotel room.

37:39.866 --> 37:42.956
That way Peter would have
a fighting chance.

37:48.962 --> 37:50.920
- Unfortunately,

37:50.964 --> 37:53.183
in this day and age,

37:53.227 --> 37:55.577
without your fib...

37:58.101 --> 37:59.929
he's gonna lose.

38:02.497 --> 38:04.282
Think of all the ball players

38:04.325 --> 38:05.761
that have covered for you

38:05.805 --> 38:08.068
over your entire career.

38:10.113 --> 38:12.115
- Yeah.

38:12.159 --> 38:14.422
Yeah, sure.
- Great.

38:15.815 --> 38:17.295
You know, if it gets him
off the hook.

38:17.338 --> 38:18.948
- Great. Thanks.

38:20.341 --> 38:21.951
That is a start.

38:21.995 --> 38:25.999
Now all we have to do
is wait for the test.

38:27.392 --> 38:29.698
- The DNA test.

38:29.742 --> 38:31.396
Let's just hope
that Peter Stone

38:31.439 --> 38:34.355
is not the father
of Sarah's daughter.

38:34.399 --> 38:36.183
Although the timing is spot-on.

38:36.226 --> 38:39.055
Her husband couldn't
get her pregnant.

38:49.196 --> 38:50.502
- You know.

38:50.545 --> 38:52.808
- I know

38:52.852 --> 38:55.681
what a guy who's willing
to commit perjury

38:55.724 --> 38:58.858
in a rape case
thinks about women.

39:00.816 --> 39:03.036
Peter Stone passed out,
didn't he?

39:03.079 --> 39:04.603
- No, no, no, no, no.

39:04.646 --> 39:07.693
No. She was all over me.

39:07.736 --> 39:09.477
I did not rape her.

39:09.521 --> 39:12.393
- She was so drunk she didn't
know what was going on.

39:12.437 --> 39:14.308
What do you call that?

39:16.397 --> 39:18.007
Stand up.

39:19.618 --> 39:22.185
Stand up!

39:22.229 --> 39:23.839
And turn around.

39:25.667 --> 39:27.103
Reggie Griggs,

39:27.147 --> 39:28.017
you're under arrest

39:28.061 --> 39:30.368
for rape in the first degree.

39:30.411 --> 39:32.108
Let's go.

39:39.986 --> 39:43.946
So Reggie's talking deal
with the DA's office.

39:43.990 --> 39:46.775
- Dropped.

39:46.819 --> 39:49.038
- Doesn't let me off the hook.

39:52.041 --> 39:54.130
I took Sarah to my hotel room.

39:54.174 --> 39:56.655
It was my friend
who assaulted her.

39:58.047 --> 40:00.659
- Peter, you couldn't
have known.

40:02.574 --> 40:06.404
- The DNA test says that Gary
is the father.

40:06.447 --> 40:08.928
Although...

40:08.971 --> 40:13.280
Sarah's been terrified
all these years.

40:15.761 --> 40:17.850
- She thought I was the father.

40:25.727 --> 40:27.468
- Peter, I'm sorry
for everything

40:27.512 --> 40:28.730
that you went through.

40:28.774 --> 40:30.297
And I'm...

40:30.340 --> 40:34.083
sorry if it seemed like
I doubted you.

40:35.476 --> 40:37.043
- Don't be.

40:37.086 --> 40:39.611
Liv, that's why
I work with you.

40:43.528 --> 40:45.094
You know, the thing is

40:45.138 --> 40:48.054
when all the noise
was coming at me...

40:49.925 --> 40:53.146
there was a moment
I doubted myself.
