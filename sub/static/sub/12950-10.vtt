00:03.503 --> 00:06.003
<i>My name is Sydney Bristow.</i>

00:06.039 --> 00:07.606
<i>Seven years ago,
I was recruited</i>

00:07.607 --> 00:10.576
<i>by a secret branch of the CIA
called SD-6.</i>

00:10.677 --> 00:12.578
<i>I was sworn to secrecy,</i>

00:12.579 --> 00:14.413
<i>but I couldn't keep it
from my fiancé,</i>

00:14.414 --> 00:16.815
<i>and when the head of SD-6
found out,</i>

00:16.816 --> 00:19.316
<i>he had him killed.</i>

00:19.452 --> 00:20.886
<i>That's when I learned
the truth.</i>

00:20.887 --> 00:22.988
<i>SD-6 is not part of the CIA.</i>

00:22.989 --> 00:24.890
<i>I'd been working
for the very people</i>

00:24.891 --> 00:26.792
<i>I thought
I was fighting against.</i>

00:26.793 --> 00:28.227
<i>So I went to the only place</i>

00:28.228 --> 00:30.062
<i>that could help me
take them down.</i>

00:30.063 --> 00:31.797
<i>Now I'm a double agent
for the CIA,</i>

00:31.798 --> 00:35.256
<i>where my handler
is a man named Michael Vaughn.</i>

00:36.636 --> 00:39.038
<i>Only one other person knows
the truth about what I do.</i>

00:39.039 --> 00:41.735
<i>Another double agent
inside SD-6.</i>

00:41.841 --> 00:44.341
<i>Someone I hardly know.</i>

00:44.411 --> 00:46.911
<i>My father.</i>

00:47.981 --> 00:48.947
What are you doing?

00:48.948 --> 00:50.849
What did you tell
that reporter?

00:50.850 --> 00:53.285
I told him exactly what
I was supposed to tell him.

00:53.286 --> 00:55.687
- Did you mention SD-6?
- Of course not.

00:55.688 --> 00:58.816
- Did you tell him about SD-6?
- No.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.025
No! No! No!

01:01.694 --> 01:04.218
Who killed Eloise Kurtz?
Who killed Daniel Hecht?

01:04.297 --> 01:07.061
Whoever did that
gave Eloise Kurtz that pin.

01:07.133 --> 01:08.067
It's on.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.102
- What do you mean? Right now?
- Yes.

01:10.103 --> 01:12.037
You have questions

01:12.038 --> 01:13.739
about Kate Jones.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.504
How far are you willing
to go, Mr. Tippin?

01:16.576 --> 01:19.076
I need to hear the words.

01:19.145 --> 01:22.012
It's an anomaly, sir.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.880
While Sydney was in the bank
vault, there was definitely

01:24.951 --> 01:27.186
an additional transmission
out of Geneva.

01:27.187 --> 01:29.588
You've been sent to SD-6
to find a mole.

01:29.589 --> 01:31.723
I look at Sydney Bristow's
test results.

01:31.724 --> 01:34.224
I don't see a single spike.
She didn't falter once.

01:34.260 --> 01:37.093
Sydney Bristow is the mole.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:50.577 --> 01:52.144
Yeah?

01:52.145 --> 01:54.645
We got her.

02:31.017 --> 02:34.612
We've known for some time
that we had a mole.

02:34.687 --> 02:37.656
That someone was working
against us.

02:37.724 --> 02:40.058
When you were in Geneva
with Agent Bristow,

02:40.059 --> 02:43.586
we picked up a transmission.
Third party.

02:43.663 --> 02:46.064
It confirmed
what some in Security Section

02:46.065 --> 02:47.599
believed for weeks.

02:47.600 --> 02:50.660
That Agent Bristow
is that mole.

02:50.770 --> 02:53.398
When you were in the field
with Bristow,

02:53.506 --> 02:55.240
there was no indication?

02:55.241 --> 02:56.241
Nothing.

02:56.242 --> 02:58.710
Hmm.

02:58.711 --> 03:01.942
We need to determine
the extent of damage done to us.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.383
- What can I do?
- You have to convince Bristow

03:04.384 --> 03:06.752
that we believe the two of you
were working together.

03:06.753 --> 03:08.353
If she doesn't reveal to us

03:08.354 --> 03:10.355
the work that she's done
against us,

03:10.356 --> 03:12.856
we'll torture you to death.

03:14.928 --> 03:16.428
Are you sure that will work?

03:16.429 --> 03:17.596
Threat to colleagues

03:17.597 --> 03:20.293
is a fundamental interrogation
technique.

03:22.368 --> 03:24.868
Sydney in particular...

03:27.073 --> 03:30.201
Yes, I think
that she will respond.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.948
Mr. Russek...

03:35.949 --> 03:38.645
You understand that we need to
make it appear

03:38.718 --> 03:41.218
that you were questioned.

04:02.575 --> 04:06.511
- They think I'm part of this.
- What do you mean?

04:06.579 --> 04:08.580
Don't play games with me.

04:08.581 --> 04:11.081
You know
what I'm talking about.

04:11.951 --> 04:15.387
A transmission was sent
from our position in Geneva

04:15.455 --> 04:17.755
at the bank.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.317
They know it was one of us.

04:20.392 --> 04:24.056
They want to know how much
damage has been done to them.

04:24.130 --> 04:25.697
There's only one person
in this room

04:25.698 --> 04:27.266
that can answer that question.

04:27.267 --> 04:31.431
Sydney, I don't know
who you're working for,

04:31.537 --> 04:34.734
but I need you to tell them
what you know.

04:34.841 --> 04:38.277
They said they're gonna
kill me, Sydney...

04:39.279 --> 04:41.779
...slowly.

04:44.150 --> 04:45.317
Do you believe them?

04:45.318 --> 04:47.878
They're not bluffing.

04:49.656 --> 04:52.156
Do you believe them?

04:52.358 --> 04:54.858
Yes.

05:05.772 --> 05:08.240
Has Sydney Bristow
moved her desk?

05:08.241 --> 05:11.677
No, Security Section cleared
it out about an hour ago.

05:16.416 --> 05:18.383
Get on your knees.
Put your heads to the floor.

05:18.384 --> 05:20.884
Now!

05:22.689 --> 05:26.819
Sloane wants to know
if you're ready to talk to him.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.335
No.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.836
Tell him I have nothing to say.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.511
What's going on?

05:47.914 --> 05:49.548
Talk to me.

05:49.549 --> 05:51.350
- What do you know?
- What do I know?

05:51.351 --> 05:53.618
- Have you talked to Sloane?
- I came to you first.

05:53.619 --> 05:54.853
Jack, do me a favor...

05:54.854 --> 05:58.722
I need you to tell me
what's happening.

05:58.791 --> 06:01.291
You didn't hear this from me.

06:01.928 --> 06:04.863
While Sydney and Russek
were in Geneva,

06:04.931 --> 06:07.332
a transmission was recorded
from her location.

06:07.333 --> 06:09.067
It was not one of ours.

06:09.068 --> 06:10.435
They think it was Sydney?

06:10.436 --> 06:13.166
This is not the first
indication that she...

06:13.272 --> 06:15.772
might be working
for someone else.

06:15.808 --> 06:18.308
What exactly do they know?

06:23.716 --> 06:26.216
Jack, I'm sorry.

07:30.416 --> 07:32.916
My name is Sydney Bristow.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.978
I've seen you in the office.

07:36.055 --> 07:38.555
I always wondered
what you did.

07:41.527 --> 07:44.027
I guess this is what you do.

08:10.223 --> 08:13.920
Sir, I think
you should see this.

08:39.217 --> 08:41.653
All I'm saying is
maybe you and I should talk

08:41.654 --> 08:45.055
before we get started.

09:27.533 --> 09:28.700
Change of plans.

09:31.103 --> 09:34.334
For the past three weeks,
you've been under suspicion.

09:34.440 --> 09:36.808
We knew we had a mole.

09:36.809 --> 09:39.210
There were signs
that indicated that it was you.

09:39.211 --> 09:41.379
Then, when you were in Geneva,

09:41.380 --> 09:43.905
we picked up
a third-party transmission.

09:43.983 --> 09:46.884
It seemed to confirm
that you betrayed SD-6.

09:48.521 --> 09:52.184
What I just learned is that
it wasn't your transmission.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.860
It was Russek's.

09:55.861 --> 09:57.062
Russek.

09:57.063 --> 09:58.630
What is this?

09:58.631 --> 10:00.966
What the hell is going on?

10:00.967 --> 10:04.164
I want to talk to Sloane.
I want to talk to Sloane.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.371
No. No!

10:06.372 --> 10:09.773
No!

10:13.946 --> 10:16.972
Sydney...

10:17.049 --> 10:19.745
I never believed
that you would betray us.

10:19.819 --> 10:21.453
When I realized

10:21.454 --> 10:23.954
that it was Russek
who was the mole...

10:25.424 --> 10:27.924
...I felt vindicated.

10:41.741 --> 10:44.075
- That's impossible.
- I know.

10:44.076 --> 10:46.977
In Geneva, Russek was
transmitting to K-Directorate

10:47.046 --> 10:49.571
at exactly the same time you
were transmitting to the CIA?

10:49.649 --> 10:52.311
And that SD-6 picked up
his transmission, not mine.

10:52.385 --> 10:54.586
You should know
that the CIA has no record

10:54.587 --> 10:56.421
of contact between him
and Russian intelligence.

10:56.422 --> 10:58.823
In the cell, when Russek was
trying to get me to talk,

10:58.824 --> 11:01.026
I asked him questions
about his interrogation.

11:01.027 --> 11:02.894
When he told me that
they threatened to kill him,

11:02.895 --> 11:04.429
he was blinking
in erratic intervals.

11:04.430 --> 11:06.564
A classic indication
that he was lying.

11:06.565 --> 11:07.732
So I didn't talk.

11:07.733 --> 11:09.534
Only because I knew he wasn't
in any real danger.

11:09.535 --> 11:11.369
Either Sloane still thinks
I'm the mole

11:11.370 --> 11:13.004
and is using me somehow...

11:13.005 --> 11:15.140
No, if Sloane
still suspected you,

11:15.141 --> 11:17.275
he wouldn't run the risk
of letting you go free.

11:17.276 --> 11:19.938
Or two. Russek actually is
K- Directorate.

11:20.012 --> 11:21.112
Or three.

11:21.113 --> 11:23.248
Russek was a sacrificial lamb.

11:23.249 --> 11:26.707
That he was innocent.
Was set up to get me out.

11:28.554 --> 11:31.182
At first I thought
maybe it was the CIA.

11:31.257 --> 11:33.391
No, it wasn't us.

11:33.392 --> 11:36.361
Russek could have been working
for K-Directorate.

11:36.429 --> 11:40.160
Let's just assume that you're
the luckiest girl in town.

11:40.232 --> 11:42.701
Sorry that I called you
on the weekend.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.035
I needed to talk to you.

11:44.036 --> 11:47.494
You don't ever have to
apologize for calling me.

11:47.573 --> 11:49.941
Speaking of which,
I got you something.

11:49.942 --> 11:51.943
What?

11:51.944 --> 11:52.977
No, you didn't.

11:52.978 --> 11:55.213
I was in this store...

11:55.214 --> 11:57.182
this little, antique place.

11:57.183 --> 11:59.708
What were you doing
in an antique store?

11:59.785 --> 12:01.152
Don't know.

12:01.153 --> 12:02.153
Whatever.

12:02.154 --> 12:05.123
If you don't like it,
just don't tell me.

12:05.191 --> 12:06.191
Okay.

12:06.192 --> 12:09.218
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

12:10.930 --> 12:13.490
- Is "harn" a word?
- It's crazy, Will.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.799
- Time's up.
- Hold on.

12:14.800 --> 12:15.867
- Stop, stop.
- Will!

12:15.868 --> 12:17.001
Okay, okay.

12:17.002 --> 12:19.003
Who's gonna go first?
Okay, Amy?

12:19.004 --> 12:20.138
No. Will.

12:20.139 --> 12:21.573
Okay. Numpce.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.074
"Numpce"? That's not a word.
I challenge.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.442
- Wait.
- "Numpce" is not a word.

12:24.443 --> 12:26.277
- I think "numpce" is a word.
- "Numpce" is totally a word.

12:26.278 --> 12:28.313
I can't believe
you're even questioning this.

12:28.314 --> 12:30.942
Here it is."Numpce."
A fool, a blockhead.

12:31.016 --> 12:31.883
All right.

12:31.884 --> 12:34.185
- Your brother's so annoying.
- I got "numpce," too.

12:34.186 --> 12:35.720
What? Damn it!

12:35.721 --> 12:38.221
- Dude!
- Damn it.

12:39.792 --> 12:43.250
I got to go to work.
I'm sorry.

12:43.329 --> 12:44.896
Okay, this is ridiculous.

12:44.897 --> 12:46.865
Can we have a talk
about what you do for a living?

12:46.866 --> 12:49.334
I know.
There are these bankruptcies.

12:49.335 --> 12:51.102
It doesn't make any sense
anymore.

12:51.103 --> 12:53.037
Nobody works as hard
as you do.

12:53.038 --> 12:54.873
It's not like
you're a brain surgeon,

12:54.874 --> 12:57.275
you get called in the middle
of the night to save a life.

12:57.276 --> 12:58.943
These are bankruptcies.

12:58.944 --> 13:00.512
How much are they paying you
to live like this?

13:00.513 --> 13:01.780
Not enough.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.545
I'm gonna actually call them
and quit for you right now.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.351
- Will, I can't quit my job.
- Why?

13:06.352 --> 13:09.446
Because you just have to be
the greatest banker?

13:09.522 --> 13:11.089
Will, it's my job.
I want to do it well.

13:11.090 --> 13:13.923
Okay, congratulations.
Me too. But at what cost?

13:13.993 --> 13:15.994
Syd, I think...

13:15.995 --> 13:17.862
I think you're acting
like a numpce.

13:17.863 --> 13:20.525
To you, my job might seem
pointless and stupid.

13:20.599 --> 13:22.467
But it's not.
It's far from pointless.

13:22.468 --> 13:23.902
If you knew what I dealt,

13:23.903 --> 13:27.339
you might even thank me
for doing my job so well.

13:28.941 --> 13:31.671
What the hell
are you talking about?

13:32.945 --> 13:34.279
Nothing.

13:34.280 --> 13:37.511
I'm going to work.
I'll see you guys.

13:43.422 --> 13:46.118
Ineni Hassan is a wanted man.

13:46.192 --> 13:48.459
He's been selling arms
to K-Directorate

13:48.460 --> 13:50.328
and is now, we believe,
looking to partner up

13:50.329 --> 13:52.330
with one of a number
of rogue nations.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.831
This is the last documented
photograph of Hassan,

13:54.834 --> 13:56.534
taken almost a month ago
in Madrid.

13:56.535 --> 13:59.035
Since then, we've put a lot
of manpower into finding him.

13:59.038 --> 14:00.538
But we've come up
with nothing.

14:00.539 --> 14:02.340
Last week,
thanks to Agent Bristow,

14:02.341 --> 14:06.004
we were able to seize a majority
of Mr. Hassan's private assets.

14:06.078 --> 14:09.104
We were hoping that would
help us to smoke him out.

14:09.181 --> 14:10.515
We think it has.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.483
Sig Int picked up
a burst of communications

14:12.484 --> 14:14.752
originating
from this private island.

14:14.753 --> 14:16.087
What's there?

14:16.088 --> 14:18.489
Private resort.
More hideout than hideaway.

14:18.490 --> 14:22.358
It's a fugitive's paradise.
Extradition's notoriously lax.

14:22.428 --> 14:24.095
The entire place is
heavily secured,

14:24.096 --> 14:26.656
but anyone can buy entry
for a price.

14:26.732 --> 14:28.800
You think Hassan's there.

14:28.801 --> 14:31.599
No, it's not likely.
But it gives us a lead.

14:31.704 --> 14:35.265
Severin Driscoll.
Former resident of the U.K.

14:35.374 --> 14:39.310
Master forger, military adviser,
and now self-employed.

14:39.378 --> 14:42.779
Semba Island has been his home
over the last 12 years.

14:42.848 --> 14:45.681
You think Driscoll made Hassan
new identity papers.

14:45.751 --> 14:46.951
It's our best bet.

14:46.952 --> 14:48.253
You go in as Victoria King.

14:48.254 --> 14:50.054
Daughter of industrialist
Martin King.

14:50.055 --> 14:52.922
Your assignment
is to locate Driscoll

14:52.992 --> 14:56.689
and ascertain the new identity
of Ineni Hassan.

15:03.802 --> 15:06.302
Sydney, I heard
about what happened.

15:07.873 --> 15:10.373
Are you all right?

15:11.043 --> 15:13.478
I'm fine.

15:13.479 --> 15:15.979
Russek.

15:16.949 --> 15:18.249
It was a shock.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.750
- You didn't...
- What?

15:23.522 --> 15:25.490
Have anything to do with that?

15:25.491 --> 15:27.991
What?
Did I engineer it somehow?

15:29.828 --> 15:32.328
No, Sydney, of course not.

15:35.534 --> 15:37.135
He was killed.

15:37.136 --> 15:38.670
Russek.

15:38.671 --> 15:41.171
Last night.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.078
In Kenya,
if you do find Driscoll

15:47.079 --> 15:49.147
and Hassan's new identity,
if he has one...

15:49.148 --> 15:52.879
I'll keep it away from SD-6
and give it to you.

15:57.589 --> 15:59.557
- You hear that?
- What?

15:59.558 --> 16:00.491
That pitch.

16:01.560 --> 16:02.894
Definitely 9-millimeter.

16:04.063 --> 16:06.164
That was a close-range hit.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.768
Twice in the chest.
Once in the head.

16:10.769 --> 16:11.736
Yeah.

16:11.737 --> 16:14.105
That's exactly how
Eloise Kurtz was killed.

16:14.106 --> 16:16.606
Whoever sent me this tape wants
me to hear her getting killed.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.009
Why in the hell
would he want that?

16:18.010 --> 16:20.044
You don't know it's a he.

16:20.045 --> 16:21.579
You hear that?

16:21.580 --> 16:23.915
That delay before the last one?

16:23.916 --> 16:25.049
That's the one in the head.

16:25.050 --> 16:26.651
Can we isolate that?

16:26.652 --> 16:28.453
Yeah. I can definitely
improve on it.

16:28.454 --> 16:30.555
This tape was made
from that pin I gave you.

16:30.556 --> 16:33.184
So whoever paid that girl
to say she was Kate Jones

16:33.258 --> 16:34.859
is the same person
who gave her the pin

16:34.860 --> 16:36.394
and who sent you the tape.

16:36.395 --> 16:37.295
Not necessarily.

16:37.296 --> 16:39.063
Someone else could have
given her the pin

16:39.064 --> 16:41.692
or replaced the one
she already had with the bug.

16:41.767 --> 16:43.101
This was on
a wireless transmitter,

16:43.102 --> 16:44.469
so someone else
could've made this tape.

16:44.470 --> 16:46.995
Hey.
We're getting somewhere.

16:47.106 --> 16:48.840
Why would someone

16:48.841 --> 16:51.776
send the fake Kate Jones
and want me to hear this?

16:51.844 --> 16:52.744
Wait. Shh.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.412
Did you tell him about SD-6?

16:54.413 --> 16:56.080
- What was that?
- Hold on.

16:56.081 --> 16:58.845
Did you tell him about SD-6?
About SD-6?

16:58.917 --> 17:01.417
SD-6.

17:01.487 --> 17:02.653
SD-6.

17:02.654 --> 17:04.622
Play that back.

17:04.623 --> 17:06.790
Did you tell him about SD-6?

17:06.791 --> 17:09.920
What the hell's SD-6?

17:26.944 --> 17:28.079
Hey.

17:28.079 --> 17:31.208
I'm sorry that I was
snippy with you about my job.

17:31.283 --> 17:32.583
Oh.

17:32.584 --> 17:34.786
It's your job.
You're allowed to be.

17:34.787 --> 17:36.988
I was a jerk.
I'm sorry I was a jerk.

17:36.989 --> 17:39.057
You don't have to
apologize to me.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.691
I was just...

17:40.692 --> 17:42.927
I see you working
so hard lately.

17:42.928 --> 17:44.996
Yeah, I know.
That's why I'm here.

17:44.997 --> 17:46.431
I was talking to Francie.

17:46.432 --> 17:48.932
I need to do something
that's not job-related.

17:48.934 --> 17:53.030
Maybe the four of us should
go to Lake Arrowhead

17:53.138 --> 17:54.705
for a few days next week.

17:54.706 --> 17:57.008
- I've got a trip tonight...
- Of course you do.

17:57.009 --> 17:59.509
But I am off all next week.

17:59.878 --> 18:02.378
Yeah, yeah.
I'm in.

18:07.119 --> 18:08.119
What?

18:08.120 --> 18:10.620
You're not here alone,
are you?

18:11.690 --> 18:12.690
Hey.

18:12.691 --> 18:13.791
- Hi, Jenny.
- Hi.

18:13.792 --> 18:16.160
Do you want to come in?

18:16.161 --> 18:18.229
No, thanks.
I'm gonna go.

18:18.230 --> 18:19.931
Okay. It was
good to see you, though.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.432
- You too. Bye.
- Bye.

18:30.275 --> 18:32.775
Hmm.

18:49.194 --> 18:50.528
May I help you?

18:50.529 --> 18:53.794
I'm Victoria King.
You're expecting me.

18:53.866 --> 18:55.399
Welcome to Semba Island.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.900
Let me check on your suite.
One moment, please.

18:57.903 --> 19:00.338
Okay, this place
you're going to is swank.

19:00.339 --> 19:04.105
I mean, it's super-swank,
which is why I made you...

19:04.176 --> 19:05.943
these puppies.

19:05.944 --> 19:08.012
Not only do they take
pictures silently

19:08.013 --> 19:10.880
and have telephoto lenses,
but...

19:10.949 --> 19:13.449
they're super-swank.

19:43.382 --> 19:45.082
- Oh, excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

19:45.083 --> 19:48.644
Ms. King, your suite is ready.
Enjoy your stay.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.220
I'll try.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.248
I'm very sorry
about the music.

20:17.249 --> 20:19.050
Excuse me?

20:19.051 --> 20:21.018
Sometimes
when I drink too much,

20:21.019 --> 20:23.749
I play my music too loudly.

20:23.822 --> 20:26.382
Last night, I drank too much.

20:27.526 --> 20:30.086
I didn't hear any music
last night.

20:31.129 --> 20:33.629
That's impossible.

20:34.366 --> 20:36.834
You are the man from suite 47.

20:36.835 --> 20:38.336
No.

20:38.337 --> 20:40.338
I wish I were.

20:40.339 --> 20:41.739
Severin Driscoll.

20:41.740 --> 20:44.368
Victoria King.

20:44.476 --> 20:46.711
You look so familiar.
Where are you staying?

20:46.712 --> 20:50.739
I'm a resident here.
Suite 350.

20:51.416 --> 20:53.941
You, um,
have a standing invitation.

20:54.019 --> 20:56.817
I'm so embarrassed.

20:56.888 --> 20:59.388
I like loud music.

21:00.325 --> 21:02.825
I'll see you around.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.266
Mr. Stoller...

21:08.267 --> 21:11.464
Hi. I'm Will Tippin.
I left you a message.

21:11.570 --> 21:12.937
- Yeah.
- How you doing?

21:12.938 --> 21:13.971
I'm a reporter.

21:13.972 --> 21:16.240
I'm doing research
on something called SD-6.

21:16.241 --> 21:18.709
I did a search of it.
It came up with one match.

21:18.710 --> 21:20.845
It was from a deposition from
a case that you had tried.

21:20.846 --> 21:23.314
The people vs. David McNeil.

21:23.315 --> 21:25.349
Yeah, David McNeil's
an old friend of mine.

21:25.350 --> 21:28.342
Great. Do you recall
a reference to SD-6?

21:28.420 --> 21:31.548
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
Discovery lasted years.

21:31.623 --> 21:35.286
I'm really trying to figure out
what exactly SD-6 is.

21:35.360 --> 21:36.761
Do you think that, perhaps,

21:36.762 --> 21:38.929
maybe Mr. McNeil was
a part of it?

21:38.930 --> 21:41.831
David McNeil is a regular guy.
A computer programmer.

21:41.900 --> 21:44.767
He started a business
other people wanted to buy.

21:44.836 --> 21:47.204
One company wouldn't take no
for an answer.

21:47.205 --> 21:50.504
When David said no,
that same day,

21:50.575 --> 21:52.777
the government started
an investigation.

21:52.778 --> 21:55.112
He was charged
with larceny after trust

21:55.113 --> 21:57.214
and eventually sentenced
to 16 years.

21:57.215 --> 21:59.715
If he's such an innocent,
why'd he plea-bargain?

22:02.587 --> 22:04.121
His wife killed herself.

22:04.122 --> 22:06.290
His daughter,
my goddaughter...

22:06.291 --> 22:08.693
now lives with my wife and I.

22:08.694 --> 22:10.861
David wanted to be sure
nothing happened to her.

22:10.862 --> 22:14.263
You think Mrs. McNeil
was murdered.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.848
Cellphone, right?
Obviously.

22:30.849 --> 22:33.084
But observe.

22:33.085 --> 22:33.784
Huh?

22:33.785 --> 22:37.949
This unscrambles any standard
jeri-code key-card system,

22:38.023 --> 22:40.523
which is what they use
on Semba Island.

23:29.474 --> 23:31.974
Who the hell are you?

23:38.450 --> 23:39.950
Where the hell is Severin?

23:39.951 --> 23:42.579
He was supposed to meet me here
20 minutes ago.

23:42.654 --> 23:44.588
You are pointing a gun at me.
Put that down!

23:44.589 --> 23:46.290
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

23:46.291 --> 23:48.259
Well, look at me.
Look closely.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.694
You don't know this face?
You don't know who I am?

23:50.695 --> 23:53.195
No.

24:28.133 --> 24:30.633
I'm sorry.

24:37.909 --> 24:41.037
I'm sorry
you had to see that.

24:41.112 --> 24:44.138
Ineni Hassan doesn't
just have a new name.

24:44.216 --> 24:46.810
He has a new face
and is living in Havana.

24:46.885 --> 24:49.877
He's now using the alias
Nebseni Saad.

24:49.955 --> 24:53.288
As you know, he's broken
an agreement with SD-6.

24:53.358 --> 24:55.192
He has stolen from us.

24:55.193 --> 24:58.128
The whole community
is watching.

24:58.196 --> 25:00.364
We need to set an example
with Hassan.

25:00.365 --> 25:02.600
Any intel about where
in Havana he might be?

25:02.601 --> 25:04.502
No. We don't know.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.871
That's why I'm sending you
to Cuba.

25:06.872 --> 25:09.773
I need you to rendezvous
with the usual contacts.

25:09.841 --> 25:13.004
Locate Hassan.
Take care of it.

25:16.615 --> 25:18.182
Thank you.

25:18.183 --> 25:19.717
I heard about Russek.

25:19.718 --> 25:22.218
And now with Hassan...

25:23.255 --> 25:26.224
I understand it's been
a difficult week.

25:32.230 --> 25:34.231
One night...

25:34.232 --> 25:37.099
Oh, this is years ago.

25:37.168 --> 25:40.763
Maybe two years
before you and I met.

25:40.872 --> 25:43.372
I'd just finished
my first Far-East briefing

25:43.375 --> 25:44.875
at the White House.

25:44.876 --> 25:47.376
I was new to the CIA.

25:47.979 --> 25:49.146
After that meeting,

25:49.147 --> 25:52.708
everyone got into a limousine
to head back to Langley.

25:52.784 --> 25:54.885
I didn't.

25:54.886 --> 25:56.921
I told them I was gonna walk
for a while.

25:56.922 --> 25:58.589
They all looked at me funny.

25:58.590 --> 26:00.858
It was a cold night.

26:00.859 --> 26:03.760
So I said I needed to get
some air.

26:05.764 --> 26:10.997
But the truth is
I was overcome.

26:11.836 --> 26:13.304
It had occurred to me

26:13.305 --> 26:16.706
as I was walking down
the White House steps...

26:16.775 --> 26:19.275
that I was living
in a perfect moment.

26:21.179 --> 26:24.808
Everything was filled
with promise.

26:24.883 --> 26:27.909
My role in the CIA.

26:27.986 --> 26:32.047
My relationship with a wife
that I had not yet met.

26:33.258 --> 26:37.627
Still, I could feel
a darkness coming.

26:38.763 --> 26:40.998
So I wandered around
for a while.

26:40.999 --> 26:43.593
Ended up
at the Jefferson Memorial.

26:43.668 --> 26:46.168
It was always my favorite one.

26:48.006 --> 26:50.174
Looked out across the basin.

26:50.175 --> 26:52.476
Lincoln, right there.

26:52.477 --> 26:55.378
I didn't know how
it would finally materialize.

26:55.447 --> 26:58.075
The darkness.

26:58.149 --> 27:00.384
I had nothing to base it on.

27:00.385 --> 27:04.617
It wasn't as if the CIA
had just betrayed me.

27:04.689 --> 27:08.853
That my wife had just been
diagnosed with lymphoma.

27:10.729 --> 27:14.324
None of that had happened yet.

27:14.399 --> 27:17.095
So whenever life takes
an unfortunate turn,

27:17.168 --> 27:19.203
as it has this week,

27:19.204 --> 27:22.867
I just remind myself...

27:22.974 --> 27:26.705
that I could see it coming
all along.

27:30.715 --> 27:36.347
I want Hassan dead...

27:36.421 --> 27:38.921
before the weekend.

27:39.557 --> 27:43.493
Hassan's new identity
is Nebseni Saad.

27:43.561 --> 27:46.962
This is his passport number.

27:47.032 --> 27:48.899
I got back to Los Angeles
this morning

27:48.900 --> 27:50.067
and met with Sloane.

27:50.068 --> 27:51.602
I told him
that Kenya was a failure,

27:51.603 --> 27:54.103
that I was unable to find out
Hassan's new identity.

27:54.105 --> 27:56.273
Sloane found out last night
that Hassan,

27:56.274 --> 27:59.710
or whatever his name is now,
is in Cuba.

28:01.112 --> 28:05.105
Sloane sent your father
to Cuba to kill Hassan.

28:06.317 --> 28:09.912
After your father met
with Sloane, he met with me.

28:10.588 --> 28:12.756
I'm leaving for Cuba
in 30 minutes.

28:12.757 --> 28:15.257
What's the countermission?

28:15.493 --> 28:20.192
Sloane might want Hassan dead,
but the CIA needs him alive.

28:20.265 --> 28:21.999
We need his client list.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.730
It'll tell us what weapons
he sold, who's got them.

28:24.803 --> 28:25.869
It's invaluable.

28:25.870 --> 28:28.395
I don't need a lesson in
the international arms trade.

28:28.506 --> 28:29.840
Fine.

28:29.841 --> 28:32.810
Go to Cuba, use your contacts,
get to Hassan.

28:32.877 --> 28:35.744
Instead of taking him out,
you'll tell him the truth.

28:35.814 --> 28:37.715
SD-6 sent you to kill him.

28:37.716 --> 28:40.708
You'll then convince him
that you're turning on SD-6,

28:40.785 --> 28:42.119
that you're planning
on leaving them,

28:42.120 --> 28:43.721
and that you're willing
to fake his death

28:43.722 --> 28:45.189
in exchange for his client list.

28:45.190 --> 28:46.557
You're making a huge mistake.

28:46.558 --> 28:47.891
Am I?

28:47.892 --> 28:49.526
Trusting a man like Hassan.

28:49.527 --> 28:51.128
There will be
a CIA team waiting

28:51.129 --> 28:53.629
at the location where
his death is to be faked.

28:53.698 --> 28:55.999
Hassan will never be
a free man again.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.128
And that's all that happened?

28:59.237 --> 29:00.604
That's it.

29:00.605 --> 29:03.631
Your father's getting Hassan
for the CIA.

29:06.244 --> 29:08.744
What?

29:09.581 --> 29:10.681
Nothing.

29:10.682 --> 29:13.583
Okay, I got to go.
I've got friends coming.

29:13.651 --> 29:14.785
Francie, right?

29:14.786 --> 29:16.720
Yeah, and Will.

29:16.721 --> 29:18.555
Will.

29:18.556 --> 29:19.623
I'll see you.

29:19.624 --> 29:22.124
Okay.

29:28.566 --> 29:31.501
Hassan will never be
a free man again.

29:31.569 --> 29:34.069
I'll make contact
by 6:00 p. m. Tomorrow.

29:35.573 --> 29:39.009
I got a copy
of Russek's transmission.

29:39.077 --> 29:41.577
The one SD-6 intercepted.

29:43.715 --> 29:48.152
I also went through the CIA logs
and compared the two.

29:48.219 --> 29:50.220
They don't match.

29:50.221 --> 29:51.522
You fixed the transmission,

29:51.523 --> 29:53.157
made it look like
it was Russek,

29:53.158 --> 29:55.092
by altering the signal's
point of origin

29:55.093 --> 29:57.593
and changing
the message content.

29:58.763 --> 30:01.732
Whoever the hell
you think you are...

30:01.800 --> 30:04.101
checking up on me,
pulling my file,

30:04.102 --> 30:06.503
second-guessing my choices...

30:06.504 --> 30:08.305
let's just both face
the facts.

30:08.306 --> 30:10.934
You're not that person.

30:11.042 --> 30:13.806
Neither your experience
nor your intelligence

30:13.878 --> 30:16.779
has earned you the right
to question a thing that I do.

30:16.848 --> 30:19.348
I'm gonna make
two suggestions.

30:19.384 --> 30:21.618
One, that you stop it.

30:21.619 --> 30:23.720
Two, that the next time

30:23.721 --> 30:27.088
they assign you to be my
handler, you kindly decline.

30:29.160 --> 30:30.994
Russek never transmitted
a thing, did he?

30:30.995 --> 30:31.995
Of course he didn't.

30:31.996 --> 30:33.297
If you got
the SD-6 transmission,

30:33.298 --> 30:34.665
why the hell
are you asking me?

30:34.666 --> 30:38.102
I never got
the SD-6 transmission.

30:38.169 --> 30:40.669
It was just a hunch.

30:43.842 --> 30:46.009
I'd just learned
that my daughter

30:46.010 --> 30:49.173
was about to be tortured,
Mr. Vaughn.

30:49.247 --> 30:51.415
Most likely executed.

30:51.416 --> 30:54.010
I had no time to go for help.

31:11.336 --> 31:13.964
Some of the monitors went out
in the op-tech room.

31:14.072 --> 31:16.473
I want you to check
every connection.

31:16.474 --> 31:18.974
Now.

31:26.851 --> 31:29.186
I knew that altering
the transmission

31:29.187 --> 31:30.654
was a dangerous gamble.

31:30.655 --> 31:32.689
They could have detected
a disruption,

31:32.690 --> 31:35.190
but it was all I could do.

31:44.636 --> 31:47.628
And now you can judge
what I've done.

31:50.074 --> 31:53.043
I don't give a damn
what you do.

31:58.549 --> 32:01.643
<i># She ain't got no money,
clothes are kinda funny #</i>

32:01.719 --> 32:04.219
Syd?

32:04.656 --> 32:06.223
- Thank you.
- Sure.

32:06.224 --> 32:08.724
- Still got the shoes on?
- Yeah.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.427
- Have you ever worn snowshoes?
- Unh-unh.

32:10.428 --> 32:13.420
You got to get with the program.
There's an art form to this.

32:13.498 --> 32:14.498
What's that?

32:14.499 --> 32:15.666
Oh, nothing.

32:15.667 --> 32:17.467
Some guy from work
gave that to me.

32:17.468 --> 32:18.802
Oh, yeah? Not Dixon.

32:18.803 --> 32:21.238
No, he's still recovering.
Just some other guy.

32:21.239 --> 32:23.273
- Do I know him?
- No. He's no one.

32:23.274 --> 32:25.774
Really? He's just some guy.

32:25.777 --> 32:28.712
That's nice
that he gave you that.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.714
I know.
It was weird.

32:30.715 --> 32:32.816
- Why? How come?
- I don't know.

32:32.817 --> 32:34.284
Maybe he likes you.

32:34.285 --> 32:35.752
- No.
- Maybe he does.

32:35.753 --> 32:36.920
He doesn't like me.

32:36.921 --> 32:38.555
He doesn't like me
the way Jenny likes you.

32:38.556 --> 32:40.023
The way Jenny...
Oh, come on.

32:40.024 --> 32:41.458
She looked nice in your shirt.

32:41.459 --> 32:42.859
- It's a nice shirt.
- Nice and snug.

32:42.860 --> 32:44.594
Easy with the cheap shots.

32:44.595 --> 32:46.964
It was very flattering.
It was nice.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.865
I was just saying
that I think that...

32:48.866 --> 32:50.534
- Will.
- Okay.

32:50.535 --> 32:53.035
Iron Chef in there needs me.

32:57.909 --> 33:00.177
So this guy gave her
a Christmas present in there.

33:00.178 --> 33:01.812
Some guy from the office.

33:01.813 --> 33:02.813
Some guy.

33:02.814 --> 33:03.814
So?

33:03.815 --> 33:05.382
Oh, you didn't know about it.

33:05.383 --> 33:08.147
Know what?
What's to know?

33:08.219 --> 33:10.719
I did hear about you, though.

33:10.755 --> 33:12.456
About what?

33:12.457 --> 33:14.957
About you
and the little cheerleader.

33:15.026 --> 33:17.327
First of all,
she's not a cheerleader anymore.

33:17.328 --> 33:19.990
Secondly, the relationship
doesn't mean anything.

33:20.064 --> 33:22.564
Mm-hmm.

34:17.054 --> 34:19.222
I found this old
picture. Me and my father.

34:19.223 --> 34:20.891
I was just staring at it.

34:20.891 --> 34:22.559
And for some reason,

34:22.560 --> 34:24.795
I remembered asking him
about Santa Claus.

34:24.795 --> 34:25.728
Santa Claus?

34:25.730 --> 34:28.597
Yeah. If he was real.
If Santa Claus was real.

34:28.666 --> 34:34.400
My father would answer me
in this flat, factual way.

34:34.505 --> 34:36.907
"Yes, of course he's real."
Every time I asked.

34:36.908 --> 34:39.275
The thing is,
I knew that he was lying.

34:39.277 --> 34:41.043
That's why I'd ask him again.

34:41.045 --> 34:42.946
When I questioned him
about Russek,

34:42.947 --> 34:44.281
he was the same way.

34:44.282 --> 34:46.349
I wanted to believe him,

34:46.350 --> 34:48.485
but looking
at that stupid picture,

34:48.485 --> 34:51.649
I realized
Russek wasn't K-Directorate.

34:51.722 --> 34:53.924
He wasn't the guilty one.
I was.

34:53.925 --> 34:56.621
- Sydney...
- Russek did nothing wrong.

34:56.694 --> 34:59.254
Because of something
my father did, he was killed.

34:59.330 --> 35:01.298
Russek wasn't such an innocent.

35:01.299 --> 35:02.766
You want to know about Russek?

35:02.767 --> 35:04.901
He was an early member
of SD-6.

35:04.902 --> 35:06.770
He knew he was working
with the bad guys.

35:06.771 --> 35:09.271
He was the leader of at least
a dozen operations

35:09.273 --> 35:11.575
that stole weapons
and chemicals and intel

35:11.576 --> 35:13.677
and sold them to enemies
of the United States

35:13.678 --> 35:17.614
for cash to fund
more SD-6 operations,

35:17.682 --> 35:20.276
just like the one
that killed your fiancé.

35:21.586 --> 35:24.086
He got what he deserved.

35:24.088 --> 35:26.716
If you know so much
about Russek,

35:26.791 --> 35:29.624
then you know he wasn't
with K-Directorate.

35:31.162 --> 35:33.263
It seems he was sacrificed, yes.

35:33.264 --> 35:35.824
See, that's not a choice
my dad can just make.

35:35.900 --> 35:38.034
What would you have done?

35:38.035 --> 35:43.439
Had it been your daughter
or your son or Danny?

36:04.996 --> 36:07.624
Listen,
there's something else.

36:08.866 --> 36:12.324
In Cuba, your father made
contact with an old informant.

36:12.436 --> 36:14.961
A Havana insider. Someone
who helped set up the meeting

36:15.072 --> 36:18.064
between your father
and one of Hassan's men.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.676
What happened?

36:45.469 --> 36:48.063
Sydney,
Hassan has your father.

36:49.307 --> 36:50.640
What's being done?

36:50.641 --> 36:53.141
We have a team in place
in Havana,

36:53.211 --> 36:55.711
but Devlin doesn't want to
move yet.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.978
He says sending in a CIA team
to scour the countryside

36:59.050 --> 37:01.985
will only attract the kind
of attention we can't afford.

37:05.089 --> 37:08.525
You said you understand
what my father did for me.

37:08.593 --> 37:11.653
That he couldn't just wait
and do nothing.

37:12.763 --> 37:14.264
Then you'll understand

37:14.265 --> 37:18.326
that I'm going to need
your help to get to Cuba.

37:27.778 --> 37:31.009
Large tram
to front-gate security.

37:31.082 --> 37:32.916
Jail transport ready to load.

37:42.059 --> 37:44.584
Hi.

37:44.662 --> 37:46.730
- I'm Will Tippin.
- David McNeil.

37:46.731 --> 37:48.665
Thank you
for meeting with me.

37:48.666 --> 37:50.066
Do you mind if I...

37:50.067 --> 37:52.002
- No, that's all right.
- Great.

37:52.003 --> 37:54.801
So, in the letter you sent,
you weren't real specific.

37:54.905 --> 37:57.601
You're doing an article
on encryption software?

37:57.708 --> 38:00.208
Yeah, um...

38:01.345 --> 38:03.246
No. Not really.

38:03.247 --> 38:05.448
I think
that's an interesting topic,

38:05.449 --> 38:08.748
and if it's timely
we can do that.

38:08.819 --> 38:10.420
So why are we sitting here?

38:10.421 --> 38:12.921
I'm researching something.

38:12.990 --> 38:15.490
It's called SD-6.

38:18.329 --> 38:20.463
I don't have anything
to say about that.

38:20.464 --> 38:23.058
Why? Why don't you just tell me
what you know?

38:23.134 --> 38:25.659
- I mean...
- I don't know anything.

38:25.770 --> 38:27.304
Why don't you just tell me
what you suspect?

38:27.305 --> 38:29.805
I don't suspect anything.

38:32.910 --> 38:35.410
I met with Robert Stoller.

38:36.447 --> 38:38.448
He told me about your wife.

38:38.449 --> 38:40.949
Listen to me.

38:41.319 --> 38:44.880
You stay away from him.
Do you understand?

38:44.955 --> 38:47.357
Don't talk to him again.

39:22.059 --> 39:24.926
My men told me
that you have contacted them.

39:24.995 --> 39:25.995
How?

39:25.996 --> 39:28.931
I knew who to ask
and who to ask for.

39:29.567 --> 39:32.502
Nebseni Saad.
That's your new name.

39:32.603 --> 39:35.038
I know it. SD-6 knows it.

39:35.039 --> 39:38.304
SD-6. Your employer.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.876
Yes.

39:41.946 --> 39:45.313
They will learn what happens
when they send someone after me.

39:47.218 --> 39:48.218
Wait.

39:48.219 --> 39:51.620
I have an offer to make.
That's why I'm here.

40:02.800 --> 40:04.634
You think SD-6 ripped you off,

40:04.635 --> 40:07.135
so you stole from them,
and you disappeared.

40:07.238 --> 40:09.239
Now they've stolen
a good deal of your money,

40:09.240 --> 40:10.640
and they want you dead.

40:10.641 --> 40:13.906
SD-6 will never kill me.

40:15.279 --> 40:17.514
You're too smart
to believe that.

40:17.515 --> 40:20.416
Think about Isaac Lochan
or Ulee Schroeder.

40:20.484 --> 40:22.752
They will find you.

40:22.753 --> 40:26.746
They have a photograph
of you now from Semba Island.

40:26.824 --> 40:27.824
How?

40:27.825 --> 40:29.959
That's the same question
you'll be asking yourself

40:29.960 --> 40:31.461
the moment
before they kill you.

40:31.462 --> 40:32.729
What's your offer?

40:32.730 --> 40:35.528
You have something
of value to me.

40:35.599 --> 40:38.099
Your client list.

40:38.102 --> 40:39.335
I want it.

40:39.336 --> 40:41.998
Not for SD-6, but for me.

40:42.106 --> 40:44.606
For my own personal use.

40:49.313 --> 40:53.215
You give me your client list,
and I'll give you your freedom.

40:55.019 --> 40:56.219
How?

40:56.220 --> 40:59.348
We'll fake your death.
You and I, together.

40:59.423 --> 41:02.221
I'll return to SD-6.
Show them the photographs.

41:02.293 --> 41:05.558
They'll think
you're no longer a problem.

41:05.629 --> 41:08.129
You'll be free.

41:34.024 --> 41:36.788
How do I know that
you are not setting me up?

41:36.861 --> 41:39.421
How do I know
that if I give you my list

41:39.497 --> 41:41.331
that I've worked decades
to assemble,

41:41.332 --> 41:44.699
that you're not simply
going to shoot me anyway?

41:44.768 --> 41:47.170
Because you can trust me.

41:47.171 --> 41:48.471
Think about it.

41:48.472 --> 41:50.773
I'm the one
who contacted your men.

41:50.774 --> 41:52.175
If I really was here
to kill you,

41:52.176 --> 41:55.737
all I had to do was wait,
keep my mouth shut.

41:55.813 --> 41:58.805
You didn't know that you'd
been I.D.'d with your new face.

41:58.883 --> 41:59.883
You would have walked into town.

41:59.884 --> 42:02.751
I could have popped you
in the head like a deer.

42:02.820 --> 42:06.256
If you say yes to this,
we both win. Big.

42:06.323 --> 42:08.091
You say no, we both die.

42:08.092 --> 42:10.822
It's your call.

42:19.803 --> 42:22.303
<i>Gracias.</i>

42:23.607 --> 42:25.074
Interesting.

42:25.075 --> 42:26.409
What?

42:26.410 --> 42:30.210
Well, I think you make
a good offer,

42:30.281 --> 42:33.011
but I still don't know
if I can trust you completely.

42:33.083 --> 42:37.918
So prove to me that you are
willing to go against SD-6.

42:37.988 --> 42:39.656
Anything.

42:39.657 --> 42:41.558
You say you came alone?

42:41.559 --> 42:42.625
Yes.

42:42.626 --> 42:45.254
Well, then,
there is someone else here.

42:52.703 --> 42:55.203
