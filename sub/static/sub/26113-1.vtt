00:51.160 --> 00:53.760
Revolution
in the Russian state of Sakovya

00:53.920 --> 00:56.600
as the people continue their fight
for independence.

01:00.120 --> 01:03.120
Sakovya stands united
behind the Belav brothers.

01:03.320 --> 01:07.600
Dimitri and Arkady Belav are the inspirational
figureheads of this revolution.

01:09.560 --> 01:11.520
Belav! ALL: Belav!

01:11.720 --> 01:15.200
Charismatic politician Dimitri
and the brutal General Arkady

01:15.360 --> 01:19.720
are pushing back the Russian forces
in an incredible display of will.

01:23.800 --> 01:27.120
As war rages,
and with no clear road to peace,

01:27.320 --> 01:31.200
bodies are mounting up, and the human
cost is spiralling out of control.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.800
It's hard to see an end
to this bloody conflict.

01:44.240 --> 01:47.360
News just in that
revolutionary leader Dimitri Belav

01:47.520 --> 01:49.720
was killed today
in a Russian air strike.

01:49.920 --> 01:53.760
As Sakovya comes to terms with the
loss of its much-loved leader,

01:53.960 --> 01:57.720
the will of the people, and the
revolution itself, is crumbling.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
{\an8}by <font color=#FFFF00>chebinhdan</font>

01:59.000 --> 02:04.080
Unable to maintain control on his own,
Dimitri's brother General Arkady Belav

02:04.240 --> 02:07.680
was captured today, signalling
the end of this violent revolution.

02:08.880 --> 02:11.960
The war, for now,
is over.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.560
Oh!

03:10.960 --> 03:12.920
Go down, Viktor!

03:16.720 --> 03:19.040
This way.
He's over here.

03:30.200 --> 03:32.560
Hey. Get in.

03:37.840 --> 03:40.760
You know who I am? Yes.

03:41.880 --> 03:45.840
Good. Then we can dispense
with any formal introduction.

03:48.360 --> 03:50.320
Tell me where he is.

03:59.880 --> 04:02.400
Tell me where he is.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.640
Sorry. Did you not hear me?

04:10.480 --> 04:12.440
Tell me where he is!

04:41.000 --> 04:42.960
Fancy a cab, mate?

04:48.040 --> 04:50.760
Hold tight. Tonight
is football night.

04:50.960 --> 04:55.160
West Ham against Dynamo, last ever match at
the Boleyn Ground. It don't get any better.

04:55.320 --> 04:57.720
Fucking soccer.
I can change it if you like.

04:57.840 --> 05:00.040
Please. No problemo, mate.

05:00.200 --> 05:03.720
Thanks, man. That's better.

05:03.880 --> 05:06.560
So, tell me, big man.
Whereabouts are you from?

05:06.720 --> 05:08.640
From the States.
First time in London?

05:08.760 --> 05:11.160
16th. 16 times. Flippin' heck.

05:11.280 --> 05:13.200
You must have family here.

05:14.440 --> 05:16.400
I have.

05:18.080 --> 05:20.040
A brother.

05:27.800 --> 05:32.240
...financial market suffered losses today
as unrest in the Russian state of Sakovya

05:32.400 --> 05:35.240
raised fears of instability
in the region...

05:40.800 --> 05:45.080
Time for the sports news now as we move
over to our correspondent Jonathan Frank

05:45.240 --> 05:47.880
who is stood outside West Ham's
Boleyn Ground...

05:55.120 --> 05:57.280
You're grounded, Danni.
You know that.

05:57.440 --> 06:00.120
You think I like doing this?
Yes, I do.

06:00.280 --> 06:02.640
You don't have your own life,
so you just... Danni.

06:02.760 --> 06:05.400
...fuck with mine! Danni!

06:09.080 --> 06:11.040
It's hard for me, too.

06:37.760 --> 06:41.320
Give me your money, little
girl. Shit! Get the fuck off!

06:43.520 --> 06:47.680
Oh, my God. You scared the
shit out of me, Uncle Mike. Danni.

06:47.800 --> 06:50.080
Come here. How you been?

06:51.280 --> 06:55.520
What are you doing here?
Having a brain aneurysm, I think.

06:55.680 --> 06:58.640
Well, you know, Dad always said
if I can't use my hands,

06:58.800 --> 07:01.280
use my head. Use your head.
Yeah.

07:01.440 --> 07:05.040
I got something for you.
You know how much I love soccer.

07:05.200 --> 07:07.640
Big game. Are you serious? Yeah.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.680
Really?
Yeah, let's do it.

07:10.800 --> 07:13.880
I can't.
What do you mean you can't?

07:15.040 --> 07:17.520
I'm grounded. Ah.

07:19.600 --> 07:22.480
Suddenly, the great escape
makes sense. Mm.

07:22.640 --> 07:24.600
What are you grounded for?
Having a life.

07:27.720 --> 07:30.240
I'll talk to your mum.
We'll figure it out, all right?

07:30.400 --> 07:33.800
Yeah, you just, you just
go to the bar, and I'll go this way.

07:33.960 --> 07:36.240
You will get your ass back up that
little window

07:36.360 --> 07:38.400
or we don't stand a chance.

07:38.520 --> 07:40.440
I've missed you, big fucker.

07:40.600 --> 07:42.880
I've missed you, too,
and watch your language.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.920
Little shit.

08:04.880 --> 08:06.800
Hello, Mike.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.480
Hey.

08:10.120 --> 08:12.160
You don't have to keep
doing this, you know?

08:12.320 --> 08:14.960
Doing what? Travelling halfway
around the world

08:15.120 --> 08:17.680
just to check on us.
No idea what you're talking about.

08:17.840 --> 08:21.040
I just came for one of those shitty,
warm pints of beer you serve.

08:21.160 --> 08:23.680
Coming right up. All right.

08:26.920 --> 08:28.880
So, how have you been? Yeah, good.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.200
I was, um...

08:33.600 --> 08:36.200
I was hoping to take Danni to the
game. No, I'm sorry, Mike.

08:37.320 --> 08:41.080
She's grounded.
Can she be an-grounded? I'm sorry.

08:41.240 --> 08:43.799
Look, why don't you come
over here on Sunday instead?

08:45.080 --> 08:47.080
We're having a bit of a gathering.

08:47.200 --> 08:49.680
Claire will be there. Hm.

08:49.800 --> 08:52.600
Still single. Mm-hm.

08:52.760 --> 08:57.280
Well, tell her I said hello,
but, um, I gotta fly on Friday.

09:02.440 --> 09:04.840
When are you gonna stop?

09:05.000 --> 09:08.120
You can't keep hiding in war zones
forever, Mike. I know.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.440
I'm good.

09:18.240 --> 09:20.200
Listen to me.

09:22.800 --> 09:26.240
What happened to Andy...
it wasn't your fault, Mike.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.600
You've gotta let it go.

09:33.560 --> 09:37.680
You know, Andy used to talk about going
to the games with Danni all the time.

09:37.800 --> 09:40.040
I've never seen him so happy.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.440
It would mean a lot to me.

09:47.880 --> 09:50.040
Just for one night.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.680
Can I take her?

10:01.760 --> 10:05.400
No drinking. No.
No smoking. Mm-mm.

10:05.560 --> 10:08.320
And definitely no boys.
Definitely no boys.

10:37.280 --> 10:40.520
The atmosphere is electric
at the Boleyn Ground tonight

10:40.640 --> 10:42.920
for this European club semi-final.

10:43.040 --> 10:45.520
West Ham's last ever match here.

10:45.680 --> 10:48.400
Opponents Dynamo, in Europe
for the first time, of course.

10:48.560 --> 10:52.720
Emotions running high in what
promises to be a dramatic dogfight.

10:54.440 --> 10:56.960
Don't go out of my sight,
or your mum will kill me.

10:57.080 --> 10:59.640
Danni, can we get off that thing?

10:59.800 --> 11:02.360
"She's such a bitch.
That's my boyfriend."

11:02.480 --> 11:04.400
Fuck you.

11:04.560 --> 11:07.240
What the
fuck's up with those guys?

11:07.360 --> 11:09.640
They're the Dynamo fans.

11:09.760 --> 11:11.720
Nice one.

11:19.240 --> 11:21.200
Danni?

11:24.840 --> 11:26.800
Press pass, please.

11:27.760 --> 11:29.760
Straight through, please.

11:29.880 --> 11:31.800
Press pass, please, sir.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.320
Straight through.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.760
Hold it, mate. ID, please.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.280
All right, yeah. Go on.
Through you go. Go on.

11:45.080 --> 11:47.040
Keep going.

11:48.800 --> 11:52.200
I can't believe you found me in all
this chaos. You're too hot to miss.

11:52.360 --> 11:54.960
Come on, Brandon. It's true.
Stop embarrassing me.

11:55.120 --> 11:57.800
You're killing me, smalls.
Just run off on me.

11:58.960 --> 12:01.280
Uncle Mike, this is Brandon.
What's up, bruv?

12:05.880 --> 12:08.480
Let's watch some soccer.
Bye, Brandon.

12:09.840 --> 12:12.840
Text me, yeah? Yeah.
She's well up for it.

12:12.960 --> 12:15.520
Seriously? What?

12:15.680 --> 12:19.320
He's a dick. He's cute. He's not
cute. You can do way better.

12:20.560 --> 12:22.520
All right. Let's do this.

12:36.720 --> 12:38.640
Jeez. Are you serious?

12:40.320 --> 12:42.880
Can they make that any smaller?
You're getting fat.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.920
I'm not getting fat, smart-ass.

12:47.160 --> 12:49.640
- Hey, let's get a hot dog.
- You want a hot dog?

12:49.800 --> 12:52.560
I'm starving. They fill them with
shit, Uncle Mike.

12:52.680 --> 12:55.160
You and that punk kid. No hot dogs.

12:55.320 --> 12:57.640
You're making all the wrong life
choices, Danni.

12:59.760 --> 13:02.480
Check it out.
Pretty cool, right?

13:06.880 --> 13:08.840
Yeah, pretty cool.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.960
Great seats.

13:13.120 --> 13:15.240
You can see all the fake injuries
from up close.

13:15.400 --> 13:18.920
Please welcome the
players of West Ham United!

13:19.040 --> 13:21.000
Come on!

13:21.200 --> 13:25.880
And their opponents for this final match at
the Boleyn Ground, from Sakovya in Russia,

13:26.000 --> 13:27.960
Dynamo FC.

13:28.120 --> 13:30.800
Dynamo! Dynamo! Dynamo!

13:41.720 --> 13:43.720
1-0 will do us here.

13:43.880 --> 13:46.760
That's all we need. As long as
we don't concede an away goal,

13:46.920 --> 13:49.400
we've got a good chance of getting
in to the final.

13:50.200 --> 13:53.000
I literally didn't understand
one word you just said.

13:53.120 --> 13:55.120
You know nothing about football.

13:55.280 --> 13:57.240
You sound
just like your dad.

14:00.280 --> 14:02.400
He would've loved this.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.640
So, what do we yell?

14:10.720 --> 14:12.960
Kick the ball straighter!

14:13.080 --> 14:15.200
Fall down better!

14:19.360 --> 14:21.320
Are you OK?

14:22.560 --> 14:24.520
Why did he have to do it?

14:25.920 --> 14:27.880
Do what?

14:30.280 --> 14:32.240
Die.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.720
He was a hero.

14:37.840 --> 14:40.080
I'm sick of hearing that.

14:40.240 --> 14:43.120
I'd rather Dad was a coward
and still be here

14:43.280 --> 14:46.360
than a hero and dead.
Don't say that.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.440
He obviously didn't care about me.

14:48.600 --> 14:51.480
What are you talking about?
He loved you more than anything.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.680
Why did he choose strangers
over me and Mum?

14:53.800 --> 14:55.760
He was a soldier. He took an order.

14:55.880 --> 14:57.920
Well, it was a shitty order.

15:01.960 --> 15:04.720
Dad was even more shitty
for obeying. Danni.

15:09.720 --> 15:11.800
I think I'd like that hot dog now.

15:15.880 --> 15:17.840
Sure.

15:31.760 --> 15:34.200
There you go. Thank you.
What can I get you?

15:34.320 --> 15:36.240
Two hot dogs, please, mate.

16:04.360 --> 16:06.320
What can I get you, mate?

16:08.200 --> 16:10.360
Do you need anything?
Two hot dogs, please.

16:40.320 --> 16:43.400
Seen something you don't like,
John?

16:44.880 --> 16:46.800
Well, just keep an eye on it.
Yes, sir.

17:03.680 --> 17:06.119
Looks like it might have been a
power surge, sir.

17:06.240 --> 17:08.400
OK. Everybody all right? Yeah?

17:08.520 --> 17:10.520
All right? Yes, sir.

17:18.640 --> 17:20.599
They're blind.

17:49.760 --> 17:51.720
Don't let your passion blind you.

18:07.560 --> 18:09.480
Hey! You can't
come in here.

18:26.920 --> 18:28.920
What the hell's going on?

18:31.160 --> 18:34.520
Get down on the floor.
You. Sit down.

18:42.120 --> 18:44.080
Superintendent Thompson...

18:45.480 --> 18:48.920
...we have isolated your comms. You
have no contact with the outside world.

18:49.960 --> 18:53.360
As goal commander, your men in the
stadium will call you every ten minutes,

18:53.520 --> 18:56.400
and you will respond that everything
is normal. No, I will not.

19:05.400 --> 19:07.360
Hm.

19:12.200 --> 19:15.200
This is your wife Sarah Thompson.

19:15.360 --> 19:18.200
Your children Chloe, nine,
and Ben, seven.

19:18.360 --> 19:20.480
Still dressed as they were before
you left.

19:21.480 --> 19:25.280
The man who took these pictures is waiting
at your home in Burlington Drive...

19:25.440 --> 19:28.320
and I can say
with absolute certainty...

19:29.440 --> 19:34.280
...that Sarah, Chloe and Ben would want you
to make sure that he stays in his car.

19:46.960 --> 19:49.640
Where are we with the masks?

19:49.760 --> 19:52.280
Almost there. Two more minutes.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.480
Viktor, lock us down.

20:18.880 --> 20:21.400
And as kick-off time fast
approaches,

20:21.560 --> 20:24.640
without further ado, we'll hand
you over to our commentators

20:24.840 --> 20:28.560
John Anderson, and first up, it's a
very good evening to Jonathan Pierce.

20:28.760 --> 20:33.120
Yes, thank you, Matt. And after a little
hiccup with the stadium lights here,

20:33.280 --> 20:35.200
the spotlight is firmly back
on West Ham

20:35.360 --> 20:38.120
for this historic final match
at the Boleyn Ground.

20:38.320 --> 20:43.440
And the atmosphere really is absolutely
electric at this famous old stadium.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
{\an8}chebinhdan.com

21:04.040 --> 21:07.520
Took your time, sweetheart. All
right? How have you been?

21:07.680 --> 21:10.000
Been good. How are you? I'm all
right. I'm all right.

21:10.200 --> 21:13.800
Christ, if he's family, and you grow
up to look like him, me and you are.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.760
He's not my real uncle. He visits all the
time, and he looks out me and my mum.

21:18.960 --> 21:23.520
Yeah, well, the guy's a tosser.
Stick around with us...with me.

21:30.600 --> 21:32.800
This is Danni...

21:32.920 --> 21:34.840
Damn it, Danni.

21:37.200 --> 21:39.400
All masks are set
and ready, sir.

21:39.560 --> 21:41.720
Do it. Let's get this show
on the road.

21:49.880 --> 21:52.800
So has mine.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.640
Look at that over there.

22:11.240 --> 22:13.520
OK, we're locked into all cameras.

22:16.280 --> 22:18.240
Starting the search for him now.

22:20.040 --> 22:23.160
There is no hiding, brother.

22:24.480 --> 22:26.480
Beginning with the Dynamo stand.

22:26.600 --> 22:29.480
It will find him. Hm.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.520
We hunt by computer.

22:32.880 --> 22:35.520
Don't worry. These
are our technicians.

22:35.680 --> 22:38.720
They're doing their utmost to
rectify the situation, yeah?

22:38.920 --> 22:43.240
We're doing our best. Ah. They probably
don't even have phones where you're from.

22:43.400 --> 22:46.160
What, Brixton?
Brixton via Baghdad.

22:46.280 --> 22:48.240
I should call a terror alert on you.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.840
Oh, yeah. Well, please go ahead.
No, wait, you can't!

22:51.000 --> 22:54.120
Because, as per your complaint,
the phones are down, aren't they?

22:54.280 --> 22:56.840
What you're doing
is terrorism.

22:56.960 --> 22:59.240
Emotional terrorism.

22:59.400 --> 23:02.520
Excuse me. I can't find my niece.
Is there any way you could help me?

23:02.680 --> 23:04.640
Maybe she's gone to the little
girls' room.

23:04.800 --> 23:07.840
No, she's been gone too long for
that. Well, it depends, doesn't it?

23:08.040 --> 23:11.920
If she's eating the food from here, could take
until the second half to work it all out.

23:12.120 --> 23:15.720
I'm afraid she may have left the stadium.
It's not possible. The gates are shut.

23:15.920 --> 23:19.800
No-one in or out at the moment. How is
that safe? Don't worry. There are people

23:19.960 --> 23:23.800
with brighter futures than mine who
are fixing the glitch as we speak.

23:23.920 --> 23:26.560
You're Faysal. No, it's Faisal.

23:26.720 --> 23:29.600
Faisal Khan. If anyone can,
Faisal Khan.

23:31.160 --> 23:34.680
If you're really worried about it, I can
always call up to the control room.

23:34.840 --> 23:38.160
They got CCTV up the arse.
Yeah. That'd be great. Thank you.

23:38.280 --> 23:40.640
Control, this is Faisal.

23:40.800 --> 23:43.000
Assistant to the assistant chief
steward.

23:43.120 --> 23:45.160
We have a missing child.

23:45.280 --> 23:47.360
What's her name? Danni Holloway.

23:47.480 --> 23:50.360
Subject's name is Danni Holloway.

23:50.480 --> 23:53.640
5'7", brown hair,

23:53.760 --> 23:56.200
15, going on 50.

23:56.360 --> 23:58.560
Control room, do you read me?
Ignore it.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.760
Hello!

24:03.480 --> 24:05.840
Is that the control room?
Yeah, just there.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.720
Can you take me up there?
We're not really supposed to -

24:08.880 --> 24:10.920
Can you tell me how to get up there?
please.

24:12.960 --> 24:15.920
Basically, you have to go
down this corridor and...

24:18.640 --> 24:20.600
You'll never find it. Come on.

24:20.800 --> 24:24.240
A nervy start for the home side.
That's a good through ball.

24:24.440 --> 24:29.640
He's through on goal. Dynamo have scored!
That is a disaster start for West Ham!

24:29.760 --> 24:31.920
The Hammers trail by a goal to nil.

24:33.080 --> 24:35.040
Come on West Ham!

24:35.240 --> 24:38.200
Ron, where's the...?
You're not Ron.

24:38.320 --> 24:40.840
Where's Ron? Holidays.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.600
Cheeky bastard.
He owes me a tenner, he does.

24:43.720 --> 24:45.680
He told me he'd pay me back today.

24:45.880 --> 24:49.640
I'm just taking the big fella up to control.
Not at minute. Technical difficulty.

24:50.640 --> 24:54.240
You come back later. I gotta find my
niece, man. I'm not coming back later.

24:59.520 --> 25:01.480
You're gonna wanna move now.

25:04.040 --> 25:06.000
Of course. Apologies.

25:14.640 --> 25:16.960
I couldn't help but notice an
accent.

25:17.120 --> 25:20.040
Where are you from, man? Russia.
Ah.

25:22.440 --> 25:24.960
It's cold there.

25:25.080 --> 25:27.000
Is it cold?

25:28.480 --> 25:30.560
Ground floor.

25:42.200 --> 25:44.160
Going up.

25:52.520 --> 25:54.640
It's cosy, isn't it?

26:04.480 --> 26:06.440
How come you've got Ron's badge on?

26:07.800 --> 26:10.480
Whoa!

26:13.120 --> 26:15.120
Ah!

26:47.560 --> 26:49.880
Faisal, move!

27:07.640 --> 27:10.960
Faisal, give me the gun.
Give me the gun!

27:17.240 --> 27:19.240
Floor three.

27:29.200 --> 27:31.200
Going up.

27:31.360 --> 27:34.240
What the fuck is going on?
Why did he try to kill us, man?

27:34.400 --> 27:37.200
Stay quiet.
Calm down. Floor four.

27:37.320 --> 27:39.240
Calm down.

27:41.880 --> 27:43.840
All right. Hold these doors open.

27:46.920 --> 27:49.520
Hello?
Hello, come in. Someone -

27:49.680 --> 27:51.600
Stay off the radio.
The phones are down.

27:51.760 --> 27:54.560
The gates are jammed, so this fucking
stadium is on lockdown.

27:54.760 --> 27:58.080
You're gonna have to trust me until we
figure out what the fuck it is, OK?

27:58.280 --> 28:01.960
It's gonna be all right. I knew I
should've taken that job at Arsenal.

28:02.120 --> 28:05.360
Come on. Grab a leg. No! I am not
touching a fucking dead fella, OK?

28:05.480 --> 28:07.400
Grab the fucking bag then.

28:32.040 --> 28:34.120
Dead on the shitter.
Just like Elvis.

28:40.560 --> 28:44.520
What? What is it?

28:44.640 --> 28:47.000
That's C-4. C-4?

28:47.160 --> 28:50.320
What? You mean, like highly
explosive C-4? Yeah, that's the one.

28:50.440 --> 28:52.960
What? Hold that.

28:53.120 --> 28:55.040
Are you shitting me?
What if it goes off?

28:55.240 --> 28:58.600
What the...? Not without a
detonator, it's not. Stop worrying.

28:58.720 --> 29:00.640
Stop worrying? I'm covered in blood.

29:00.840 --> 29:04.440
Trapped in a siege and carrying fucking
explosives, but 'don't worry about it'.

29:04.600 --> 29:06.800
Faisal, can you get me
to a working phone?

29:07.880 --> 29:09.880
Yeah, I think so. Take me.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.920
Erm, this way.

29:13.560 --> 29:15.520
Lock the door.

29:17.840 --> 29:19.800
You need to press nine
for an outside line,

29:20.000 --> 29:24.000
and we're not supposed to make international
calls, but I guess this is an emergency so...

29:25.440 --> 29:27.400
Phone lines are dead.

29:27.600 --> 29:31.640
What...what are you doing? I'm gonna
recalibrate this to a police frequency.

29:31.800 --> 29:34.160
Oh, where did you
learn to do that?

29:34.280 --> 29:36.520
I saw a guy do it on TV once.

29:36.680 --> 29:39.200
Yes!

29:42.640 --> 29:46.760
OK. Attention,
anyone on this frequency.

29:46.920 --> 29:49.360
There's an emergency situation
at West Ham stadium.

29:50.680 --> 29:52.920
This is police dispatch. Yes!

29:53.080 --> 29:56.480
This channel is preserved for police
personnel. Prank calls -

29:56.680 --> 30:00.920
This is not a prank call. Men with firearms
and explosives have infiltrated the stadium.

30:01.120 --> 30:04.520
They've locked down the exits. They've
blocked all cell communications.

30:04.640 --> 30:06.560
How do you know this, sir?

30:06.680 --> 30:08.600
Because I just killed one of them.

30:14.280 --> 30:16.240
Please hold.

30:50.360 --> 30:54.160
You didn't turn off your bloody
phone? It's the other one.

30:54.280 --> 30:56.600
Sorry. Sorry. Is everything OK?

30:56.720 --> 30:59.400
I'll find out. Sorry. Oh. Really?

31:05.160 --> 31:07.160
This is Steed. It's Milson.

31:07.320 --> 31:09.480
We've had a report of
armed men at Upton Park.

31:09.640 --> 31:12.680
A guy claims to be former US Army.
Likely bullshit,

31:12.840 --> 31:14.760
but one thing he says does check
out.

31:14.960 --> 31:19.200
The phone are down at the stadium. It doesn't -
Check it out. The goal commander at the stadium

31:19.360 --> 31:22.640
will have a SAT phone. Yeah, I know.
I'm on it. I'm patching you through.

31:22.800 --> 31:24.760
Goal commander's name is Steven
Thompson.

31:30.440 --> 31:32.600
The weather is fine.

31:32.720 --> 31:34.880
No idea what you're talking about.

31:35.040 --> 31:38.160
Well, if it becomes unseasonably
cold, I will kill your family.

31:41.960 --> 31:44.960
Steve Thompson. Steve, hi. This is
Chris Burrows from telecom.

31:45.160 --> 31:49.160
I understand you're having some problems with
your phones? Yeah, they've all gone down.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.200
We're sending our engineers down.
Just wondering what gear to wear.

31:53.320 --> 31:55.240
How's the weather?

31:55.400 --> 31:57.600
It's fine. I heard it was
unseasonably cold.

32:00.720 --> 32:03.760
That's a negative.
The weather's absolutely fine.

32:05.320 --> 32:07.800
OK, thanks, Steve.

32:07.920 --> 32:11.080
Tatiana, check in with everyone.

32:11.200 --> 32:13.720
Viktor, status? No matches yet.

32:13.880 --> 32:15.800
We're now searching
the whole stadium.

32:15.920 --> 32:17.840
Your computer's taking too long.

32:23.520 --> 32:26.600
Oleg, how are we doing?
Eight more minutes, sir.

32:26.760 --> 32:29.120
Then don't waste time
talking to me. Da.

32:31.920 --> 32:35.520
It's taking way too long.
They will come back, eventually.

32:35.680 --> 32:38.000
I got a 15-year-old girl
walking around out there.

32:38.200 --> 32:42.000
The longer this takes, the more chance she's
got at pissing off someone with a gun.

32:42.200 --> 32:46.800
Whoever is on this line, if you're wasting police
time, you've just committed a criminal offence.

32:47.000 --> 32:51.160
Who the fuck is this? This is Chief Commander
Daniel Steed of the Metropolitan Police Force.

32:51.320 --> 32:53.440
This channel is now blocked.
Thank you.

32:53.600 --> 32:56.040
What do you mean 'blocked'?

32:56.160 --> 32:58.080
Come in.

32:58.600 --> 33:01.600
They're not coming, are they?
They think we're fucking around.

33:01.800 --> 33:05.240
So what are we gonna do? We need to show
them that we're not fucking around.

33:05.400 --> 33:07.600
Roll call, everyone.

33:07.760 --> 33:10.240
Vlad. Da. Anton. Da.
What is it?

33:10.400 --> 33:13.240
They're checking in.
Pavel. Da. Emil. Da.

33:13.360 --> 33:16.000
Alex. Da. Nikita. Da.

33:16.120 --> 33:18.360
Yuri. Da. Boris. Da.

33:18.480 --> 33:20.920
Piotr. Da. Andrei.

33:21.040 --> 33:23.000
Andrei? That's us.

33:23.120 --> 33:25.720
Knox, say something. Andrei?

33:27.120 --> 33:29.120
Da.

33:34.800 --> 33:37.160
What does it mean? It's Russian for
we've gotta move.

33:37.360 --> 33:40.720
Whoa. Do we? Is hiding here not an option?
Because I feel like it's an option.

33:40.880 --> 33:43.840
Faisal, you can stay here and hide,
but Andrei didn't check in.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.240
They're gonna send someone here
to look for him,

33:46.400 --> 33:48.880
and they're gonna find you
and they're gonna kill you.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.680
We gotta move. No. Wait. We don't
have access to the doors up here.

33:53.840 --> 33:56.480
Does Ron? Yeah,
but he's on holiday.

33:59.480 --> 34:01.400
No, he's not. He's dead.
Sorry, buddy.

34:02.600 --> 34:04.560
Let's go.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.120
There's a problem with Andrei.

34:11.480 --> 34:14.280
Pavel, check on Andrei.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.320
Sir.

34:19.199 --> 34:21.280
Andrei?

34:23.280 --> 34:25.239
Andrei?

34:31.960 --> 34:33.920
Let's take the stairs.

34:36.320 --> 34:39.679
Andrei, this is no time
to be taking shit.

34:41.320 --> 34:43.280
Andrei.

34:45.760 --> 34:47.719
Andrei?

34:50.920 --> 34:52.920
Breach. Zone four.

34:53.080 --> 34:55.440
Cover is blown. Andrei is dead.
Shot.

34:55.560 --> 34:57.520
Police? Negative.

34:57.680 --> 35:00.760
How do you know? Police don't
leave dead bodies in toilet cubicle.

35:00.920 --> 35:04.040
Just down this corridor. There's
some double doors on the right.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.960
Vice City. San Andreas.

35:09.280 --> 35:11.600
Liberty City Stories. GTA Four.

35:13.520 --> 35:15.520
What are you doing?

35:15.680 --> 35:17.840
I'm naming GTA games
to distract myself.

35:18.000 --> 35:21.280
He's in zone four lockdown.
Key card access only.

35:21.440 --> 35:24.720
Check Andrei for his access card.
Negative, and not his radio.

35:24.840 --> 35:27.200
Move the data on Andrei's E-card.

35:29.600 --> 35:31.560
Fourth floor. Banqueting area.

35:34.040 --> 35:36.040
Entering kitchen now.

35:36.160 --> 35:38.120
Lock it down.

35:38.240 --> 35:40.160
Send Vlad and Anton.

35:48.640 --> 35:52.840
As far as I can remember, there's a shortcut
here that goes straight to the roof.

35:56.120 --> 35:58.280
I don't get it. It should work.

35:58.400 --> 36:01.040
Fuck. Is there another door? No.

36:02.600 --> 36:04.560
Back out of here.

36:09.680 --> 36:11.640
What's going on?

36:11.800 --> 36:14.840
I'd like to speak to
the person who killed my man.

36:20.240 --> 36:22.240
Speaking. Listen.

36:22.440 --> 36:26.880
Our motives here are political. Our
intentions are to threaten, not violence.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.960
So let's make a deal.

36:29.160 --> 36:33.000
Surrender yourself to my men, and you'll be
held captive until our work here is done.

36:33.160 --> 36:35.120
Resist, however,
and you will be killed.

36:35.280 --> 36:38.560
I find it hard trusting someone who
brings C-4 to a fucking soccer game.

36:38.760 --> 36:42.040
I thought Americans hated soccer. I've
been saying that all fucking day.

36:45.720 --> 36:47.680
You go ahead in this.

36:48.760 --> 36:51.400
Come on. Get in. But he just said
that we could make a deal.

36:51.560 --> 36:54.480
These people are killers. They're not
gonna make a fucking deal.

36:54.640 --> 36:57.360
There's only space in here for one.
You're two by yourself.

36:57.560 --> 37:03.320
Take out your cellphone. That's Danni.
Oh, yeah, that's charming, that is.

37:03.440 --> 37:05.400
Take a picture. All right.

37:05.560 --> 37:08.040
She's wearing a blue jacket
with flowers all over it.

37:08.200 --> 37:11.000
Find her. Get somewhere safe
and radio me, all right?

37:11.160 --> 37:14.600
- OK. I'll send it right back up. OK.
- This way.

37:16.840 --> 37:19.240
You come in the right.
I come in the left.

37:21.080 --> 37:23.040
Let us in.

37:41.600 --> 37:44.320
It's OK to come out.

37:44.440 --> 37:46.520
We mean you no harm.

37:55.880 --> 37:57.880
What are you doing?

37:59.840 --> 38:02.040
What? The lift's broken.

38:03.880 --> 38:07.360
Oh, no. No, no.
Nothing comes of that one again.

38:23.560 --> 38:25.680
Fucking idiot.

39:12.240 --> 39:14.760
Vlad, get me out!

40:00.000 --> 40:03.000
{\an8}chebinhdan.com

40:58.480 --> 41:00.440
Fuck you!

41:45.600 --> 41:48.560
Vlad. Anton. Respond.

41:52.440 --> 41:54.560
Vlad. Vlad, come in.

41:55.760 --> 41:58.000
Sorry, cupcake.

41:58.120 --> 42:00.040
They aren't with us any more.

42:27.240 --> 42:29.200
The guy's not here. Vlad is dead.

42:29.320 --> 42:31.280
What about Anton? He's gone.

42:31.400 --> 42:33.360
Not sure where.

42:33.480 --> 42:37.000
You can keep...

42:37.120 --> 42:39.880
...your warm goddamn beer...

42:41.680 --> 42:44.320
...and your cold...

42:44.440 --> 42:48.480
...fucking weather, and your dead

42:48.600 --> 42:52.040
goddamn Russians.

42:58.640 --> 43:00.600
Here you go, Commander.

43:01.880 --> 43:03.840
Ignore this.

43:26.920 --> 43:28.920
Come on!

43:29.040 --> 43:30.960
Go, go, go!

43:36.880 --> 43:40.160
Come on. Let's go!
Surround the stadium.

43:40.280 --> 43:42.440
Shit. Police are outside.

43:42.560 --> 43:44.480
All of them.

43:48.880 --> 43:50.840
Can you continue with a clear head?

43:51.960 --> 43:53.880
Soldiers die.
That was not an answer.

43:55.600 --> 43:59.840
Can I kill him? Of course.
You'll stamp him out.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.640
Then I have a clear head.
Hm. Sir.

44:03.880 --> 44:07.120
Viktor. Nearly finished
and still no matches.

44:07.280 --> 44:09.960
The system should have
found him by now. He's here.

44:10.160 --> 44:13.480
If his appearance has changed too much,
I can scan, but I need more time.

44:13.640 --> 44:16.880
No. We must move forward.
Put your technology aside.

44:17.040 --> 44:20.280
Maybe we need to adopt more
traditional means to find him.

44:21.840 --> 44:24.200
Oleg, are we ready?

44:24.320 --> 44:26.240
Armed and locked, sir.

44:33.960 --> 44:36.720
Sir. Thank you. Sir.

44:38.800 --> 44:42.360
OK, Knox. You
have my attention.

44:42.520 --> 44:45.120
I thought wasting police time
was a criminal offence.

44:45.320 --> 44:48.680
Well, you just got me out of a very
boring evening, so I'll turn a blind eye.

44:48.880 --> 44:52.680
What are we dealing with? Highly-skilled
paramilitary, Eastern European.

44:52.840 --> 44:55.120
I have no idea what they want.
How many?

44:55.280 --> 44:57.960
I counted ten. Three less than
20 minutes ago.

44:58.120 --> 45:01.440
I appreciate what you've done here,
but a lone hero at this point -

45:01.600 --> 45:04.200
I'm not trying to be a hero.
My niece is in the stadium...

45:05.280 --> 45:07.720
...and I'm not leaving without her.

45:07.880 --> 45:10.680
Congratulations
to our vigilante.

45:10.880 --> 45:14.200
You've succeeded in turning a private
matter into a very public one.

45:14.320 --> 45:16.240
Be my guest and listen in.

45:22.080 --> 45:25.200
We're back on air in 25 minutes,
everybody.

45:25.320 --> 45:27.240
Let's put that VT.

45:28.360 --> 45:30.960
- Hey, studio crew only.
- What are you -

45:31.120 --> 45:34.000
Put us on air. Now.
Everybody, shut up!

45:34.120 --> 45:36.360
Keep absolutely fucking still.

45:36.480 --> 45:39.160
You. Get up. Get on camera.

45:40.240 --> 45:42.280
On your fucking knees.

45:42.440 --> 45:45.920
If you and your friends want to
live, you read statement.

45:51.760 --> 45:54.520
I've been told to read
the following statement.

45:54.720 --> 45:57.920
Sir. Thank you. 'For the last 17
years, Her Majesty's government

45:58.040 --> 46:00.360
has been harbouring a war criminal.'

46:00.480 --> 46:02.560
Rebel insurgent Dimitri Belav.

46:02.720 --> 46:05.200
Check out the name for me.
Dimitri Belav. Sir.

46:05.360 --> 46:08.080
We know you're somewhere
in this stadium tonight.

46:08.240 --> 46:10.920
We demand the government
to give us his location.

46:12.040 --> 46:16.360
100 blocks of C-4 explosives have
been placed throughout the arena.

46:17.520 --> 46:20.000
If Dimitri Belav's location
is not given to us

46:20.160 --> 46:23.000
by the time the match clock
reaches 90 minutes,

46:23.120 --> 46:25.120
we will detonate the explosives.

46:25.240 --> 46:27.520
35,000 souls for one.

46:28.600 --> 46:32.240
If any attempt is made to enter
the stadium in any capacity,

46:32.360 --> 46:35.120
we will detonate the explosives.

46:35.280 --> 46:39.120
If any attempt is made to contact
the hostages within the stadium,

46:39.240 --> 46:42.000
we will detonate the explosives.

46:42.160 --> 46:45.680
Several people have died today,
and more will follow.

46:45.800 --> 46:48.560
How many is up to you.

46:48.720 --> 46:51.520
- The clock is ticking.
- Good.

46:52.840 --> 46:55.360
No. No. Please.

46:55.480 --> 46:57.440
Boom.

47:07.720 --> 47:10.640
I want this block cleared,
and a direct comms link to Cobra,

47:10.760 --> 47:12.720
and scramble the SAS. Now!

47:12.880 --> 47:15.680
We've lost our link to
the studio for the moment,

47:15.880 --> 47:20.360
but we will carry on commentating regardless. I
don't know. You can't get the staff these days.

47:20.520 --> 47:23.040
Faisal, tell me something good.
Hey, man.

47:23.200 --> 47:26.160
It's good to hear your voice. I
thought - Any sign of Danni?

47:26.280 --> 47:28.240
Right. No. Not yet.

47:28.400 --> 47:31.440
I am searching, though. I'm trying.
All right.

47:31.600 --> 47:34.120
You check the north stands.
I'm gonna search the east.

47:34.280 --> 47:37.120
Got it. What about the cops?
Did they show up? Yeah.

47:39.040 --> 47:41.560
The world outside this place knows
what's happened.

47:41.720 --> 47:44.520
People in here are still blind.
We gotta keep it that way.

47:44.680 --> 47:48.000
If the crowd figures out what's going
on, there'll be a stampede. Copy?

47:48.160 --> 47:51.080
Copy that.
Just keep looking for her.

47:52.680 --> 47:55.920
Come on, kid. Where are you?

47:56.040 --> 47:58.520
Come on. Hey. No.

47:58.680 --> 48:02.200
Maybe I should go back.
Uncle Mike - Oh, fuck him.

48:02.360 --> 48:05.120
He doesn't own you.
Brandon, stop.

48:05.280 --> 48:07.600
I thought we came here to talk.
No more talking.

48:07.720 --> 48:10.320
Let's loosen up a bit, shall we?

48:18.840 --> 48:20.800
Oh, shit.

48:22.440 --> 48:24.400
I'm a pub kid.

48:42.160 --> 48:44.560
That's him.

48:44.680 --> 48:46.600
Track back. Follow him.

48:49.360 --> 48:52.280
What am I looking for?
Something we can use against him.

49:00.960 --> 49:02.920
This is Commander Daniel Steed.

49:03.120 --> 49:07.680
I'm here to assist in peaceful negotiation for an
end to this situation. We need the following...

49:07.840 --> 49:10.280
A couple of hostages
as a show of good faith?

49:10.400 --> 49:12.360
Here's how that would play out.

49:12.520 --> 49:16.320
I would agree, and then
I would shoot three women,

49:16.520 --> 49:20.440
and drop them from the balcony into the
car park in front of the world's media,

49:20.600 --> 49:24.320
as a show of resilience.
Shall we not go down that road?

49:24.480 --> 49:27.600
You have the exterior surrounded,
Commander,

49:27.720 --> 49:29.680
but I hold all the cards.

49:29.840 --> 49:32.080
So how do we resolve
this peacefully? I believe

49:32.240 --> 49:34.720
I have expressed my demands
quite vividly.

49:34.920 --> 49:39.080
I was told that Dimitri Belav is dead.
You are further behind than I thought.

49:39.240 --> 49:41.960
Do not call me back
until you have caught up.

50:03.240 --> 50:05.240
Can you tell us what's happening?

50:05.360 --> 50:07.320
Get me more information, and fast.

50:07.480 --> 50:09.920
One false move,
and we have a bloodbath here.

50:10.080 --> 50:13.400
And when are the SAS due? Five
minutes out. Four in the group.

50:13.600 --> 50:17.280
Thank you. Sir, we're sending through
an Agent Cho. I don't know him.

50:17.440 --> 50:20.880
He's not one of ours. Who gave him
clearance? Not me, sir.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.920
It came from the top.

50:25.200 --> 50:27.200
Steed. And who might you be?

50:27.320 --> 50:29.240
I'd like to see the body, please.

50:39.560 --> 50:41.880
Oh, shit. What?

50:42.040 --> 50:45.400
This is Anton Ivanov. This is all as
bad as I thought.

50:46.920 --> 50:49.360
Everybody, clear out. Now!

50:50.400 --> 50:52.360
Sir.

50:59.440 --> 51:02.080
What I'm about to tell you stays
between us, understood?

51:02.200 --> 51:04.680
Of course. Show him the file.

51:06.160 --> 51:09.000
This is Sakovya, Russia, right now.

51:09.200 --> 51:13.240
Thousands have gathered in the street at
the mere mention of Dimitri Belav's name.

51:13.360 --> 51:15.320
Why? Who is he?

51:15.520 --> 51:19.320
20 years ago, he and his brother led
an uprising to fight for independence.

51:19.480 --> 51:22.560
Officially, he was killed in 1999.
Unofficially?

51:23.720 --> 51:25.960
Dimitri's revolution
was out of control.

51:26.120 --> 51:28.360
Killing more people
than he was saving.

51:28.520 --> 51:32.960
He had to stop it, so he came to us.
We faked his death.

51:33.120 --> 51:35.040
He was given extensive
plastic surgery

51:35.240 --> 51:38.040
and moved to London
under diplomatic amnesty.

51:38.200 --> 51:41.920
Without its charismatic leader,
the revolution crumbled.

51:42.120 --> 51:46.480
Peace was restored, and Dimitri's brother
Arkady was jailed for war crimes.

51:46.640 --> 51:49.200
He is the man who has taken control
of your stadium.

51:50.240 --> 51:52.800
Do you see the mustard?

51:52.920 --> 51:54.880
Thanks.

51:55.040 --> 51:57.960
Three months ago, he found out
about Dimitri's betrayal.

51:58.160 --> 52:01.520
We need to find Dimitri Belav's location
inside the stadium immediately.

52:01.720 --> 52:06.560
We may have no choice but to hand him over. We
conspired with him. We can't have that lie exposed.

52:06.720 --> 52:09.520
If Arkady kills him on live TV,
it will cause a shitstorm.

52:09.680 --> 52:13.600
It'll not only destroy a country,
it'll destabilise the entire region.

52:13.720 --> 52:15.880
The lives of millions are at stake.

52:16.040 --> 52:18.880
So I'm not here to assist handing
Dimitri over, Commander.

52:19.000 --> 52:22.040
I'm here to ensure he stays dead.

52:25.280 --> 52:28.120
Hm. That's good.

52:35.000 --> 52:38.560
Sir, I traced him back to his seat.
And?

52:38.680 --> 52:40.880
His name is Michael Knox.

52:41.080 --> 52:45.480
He bought his ticket with a credit card
from a US account for him and a girl.

52:45.600 --> 52:47.760
He's ex-army. No fixed abode.

52:47.960 --> 52:51.880
Officially inactive but bounces from place
to place, working for private sector.

52:53.080 --> 52:56.440
And the kid? I ran her
through MET database.

52:56.560 --> 52:59.120
She comes up as Danni Holloway, 15.

52:59.280 --> 53:02.480
Two recent police cautions.
One for fighting at school,

53:02.640 --> 53:05.920
and the other for vandalism
of public property.

53:06.080 --> 53:08.000
And this is where it gets
interesting.

53:08.160 --> 53:11.760
Her father was killed-in-action
while serving under Knox.

53:11.880 --> 53:14.640
Where is she now?

53:14.760 --> 53:16.680
Bringing up live feed.

53:18.480 --> 53:21.920
We should probably
get back to Uncle Mike. Come on.

53:22.080 --> 53:24.160
He'll be worried about me.
Let him worry.

53:26.160 --> 53:28.520
Come on.
We ain't come down here to talk.

53:28.640 --> 53:31.440
Yes, I did. Fucking let go!

53:31.600 --> 53:34.320
You teasing slag. Do you think I'm
missing this game

53:34.480 --> 53:37.360
so you can whine about your dad and
your fucking uncle?

53:37.480 --> 53:39.400
You fucking stupid -

53:39.560 --> 53:43.720
Uncle Mike was right. You
are a dick.

53:49.640 --> 53:53.120
Danni Holloway,
please report to gate eight.

53:53.240 --> 53:56.000
Danni Holloway. Danni Holloway.

53:56.120 --> 53:58.920
Please report to gate eight.

53:59.080 --> 54:01.720
Faisal, what the hell?
Hey, boss. It's not me.

54:04.040 --> 54:07.640
Fuck. Faisal, just tell me,
can you see Danni?

54:07.800 --> 54:10.600
I can't. I'm sorry.
I'm looking.

54:10.760 --> 54:14.040
We cannot let her get to that gate.
You hear me? They're waiting for her.

54:15.520 --> 54:18.760
Oi, I see her!
Lower level, west stand.

54:23.720 --> 54:26.480
Danni! Danni!

54:26.680 --> 54:31.360
Dynamo, taking control of the game.
This is a great run by Goldov.

54:31.480 --> 54:33.440
Oh, lovely tackle by Gava.

54:50.160 --> 54:53.200
West Ham looking to push forward.
Frost to Thornley.

54:55.600 --> 54:57.560
Danni!

54:58.760 --> 55:01.600
See her. I have him.
Put your police on him.

55:02.680 --> 55:05.000
Remove that bastard,
or I'll remove you.

55:07.320 --> 55:10.360
All available men
to the north-west corner.

55:10.480 --> 55:12.400
Big guy. Army jacket.

55:14.480 --> 55:17.240
Take him down.

55:17.360 --> 55:19.280
Hold him. Wait. Danni!

55:20.920 --> 55:22.880
Danni! Come here. Danni!

55:24.120 --> 55:26.080
Out of my fucking way.

55:27.120 --> 55:29.440
Oh, that's a nice play
from Johnson.

55:29.600 --> 55:32.840
Danni! The West Ham wonder man
is blasting down the wing.

55:40.200 --> 55:42.840
Oh, it's a terrible foul.
Get off me.

55:42.960 --> 55:44.880
Hold him.

55:54.480 --> 55:57.200
Higginson with the free kick,
looking for an equaliser.

55:57.320 --> 55:59.240
Danni!

56:02.240 --> 56:04.200
Shit. Uncle Mike?

56:08.520 --> 56:12.280
What a goal. What a strike!

56:14.880 --> 56:16.840
Danni!

56:23.840 --> 56:25.800
Faisal, where's Danni?

56:26.880 --> 56:29.680
I have Danni. I've got her, boss.
Over and out.

56:31.040 --> 56:33.840
- Great job, Faisal.
- An equalising goal.

56:34.000 --> 56:39.040
We've lost them. They're under the
flag. Miguel Hernandez!

56:41.760 --> 56:44.040
And that's the
half-time whistle.

56:44.240 --> 56:48.320
West Ham have been shot by the Russian's
physicality at times, but they've stood firm,

56:48.440 --> 56:50.360
and they're level at the interval.

56:51.600 --> 56:54.040
'He got away, Sarge.
Suspect is still at large.'

56:54.160 --> 56:56.080
You have failed me, Superintendent.

56:57.560 --> 57:00.160
Since you and your men
are of no value to me...

57:18.120 --> 57:20.080
He's OK. He's just down here.

57:20.640 --> 57:22.600
Uncle Mike.

57:25.960 --> 57:27.960
Danni, are you OK? Yeah.

57:28.080 --> 57:30.280
We gotta get you safe. Shit.

57:30.440 --> 57:34.080
Faisal, you know this place.
There's gotta be a way out of here.

57:34.200 --> 57:36.360
Come on, Faisal. Think.

57:36.480 --> 57:39.320
OK, just follow me. OK?

57:39.440 --> 57:41.400
These turnstiles are old as fuck,

57:41.560 --> 57:43.600
but there's a trick
you can use, right?

57:43.760 --> 57:46.640
All you need to do is apply pressure
here and it should -

57:46.760 --> 57:48.840
Faisal, stop.

57:48.960 --> 57:51.200
Wait. Don't push that gate.

57:59.400 --> 58:02.560
It's a trigger.
If you push that gate...

58:02.680 --> 58:05.360
And what? And what?

58:16.040 --> 58:18.960
Oh, shit. They weren't lying.

58:20.040 --> 58:22.360
Steed. Come in, Steed.

58:22.480 --> 58:24.880
Steed here. We found their C-4.

58:25.080 --> 58:28.600
I'm here with Captain Reynolds of the
SAS and I'm putting you on open comms.

58:28.760 --> 58:30.920
Describe the device. It looks
complicated.

58:32.080 --> 58:34.080
Multiple wires. Follow them.

58:34.200 --> 58:36.120
Some leading to the det, some lead-

58:39.200 --> 58:41.200
I'm looking at switches. Shit.

58:41.360 --> 58:44.680
What does that mean? It's rigged to
blow, if tampered with in any way.

58:44.840 --> 58:47.320
The only way to disarm that device
is the kill switch.

58:47.480 --> 58:49.440
What kill switch? The broadcasted
suspect

58:49.600 --> 58:51.640
was wearing a remote switch around
his wrist.

58:51.800 --> 58:53.840
It should be able to deactivate the
bomb.

58:53.960 --> 58:55.920
How much C-4 is there?

58:56.040 --> 58:58.000
About 100 blocks. Location?

58:58.160 --> 59:00.680
Southwest corner.
Right under the control room.

59:00.840 --> 59:04.200
Why place it under the control room?
They'd die in the blast as well.

59:04.360 --> 59:07.680
No. They won't be anywhere near it.
It's a diversion.

59:07.840 --> 59:10.520
They'll blow the control room,
and escape in the chaos.

59:10.640 --> 59:13.800
Jesus. How many casualties?

59:13.960 --> 59:16.560
We're looking at a blast radius
of blocks G through M.

59:16.720 --> 59:20.600
That's thousands of people. Arkady
doesn't care about the casualties.

59:20.720 --> 59:22.680
He only cares about one thing.

59:22.880 --> 59:27.040
The only reason that stadium is still standing
is because he doesn't have his brother yet.

59:27.200 --> 59:29.920
As soon as he gets Dimitri,
he'll detonate his explosives.

59:30.080 --> 59:32.480
Look... We make an assault.
Get that kill switch.

59:32.640 --> 59:34.760
Not possible. There'd be too big a
death toll.

59:34.920 --> 59:38.120
That may very well be, Commander,
but we're running out of time here.

59:38.280 --> 59:40.920
All right. They want
this Dimitri guy, right?

59:41.080 --> 59:43.200
What if we get to him first?
Still a problem.

59:43.360 --> 59:45.840
We can't get into the stadium
without being detected.

59:45.960 --> 59:48.360
You don't need to. I can get Dimitri.

59:48.480 --> 59:50.560
Give me his location. I'll grab him.

59:50.720 --> 59:53.400
Send the choppers up.
I'll meet you on the roof.

59:53.520 --> 59:56.040
This could work. One condition.

59:56.160 --> 59:58.680
If I get Dimitri up to the chopper,

59:58.840 --> 01:00:01.440
you get Danni out of here
with him. Deal?

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000
{\an8}chebinhdan.com

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.680
Let's do it.

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:12.040
Our extraction point is the far
corner, above the south stand.

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:14.880
It's out of the blast radius
and downwind of the stadium,

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:18.920
so that'll help mask our approach, but once
we're in position, we're fully exposed.

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:20.960
I need Dimitri's location.

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:24.080
Dimitri is in seat B657.

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:26.440
That's the far corner on the
east stand.

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:30.240
How long have we got? We estimate seven
minutes for you to get to Dimitri's seat.

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.880
Another five to get him to the roof.
That's a tight plan.

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:37.200
Once we start our approach, there's no turning
back. They'll be coming, so watch yourself.

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:39.880
In exactly 12 minutes, we'll be in
position.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.160
Roger that. You'd better be there.

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:45.440
Don't go. Danni.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.720
I've gotta get this Dimitri guy,
or they're gonna blow the stadium.

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:51.760
I don't want you to die saving
strangers like my dad did.

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:56.160
I'm doing this for some strangers.
Danni...

01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:00.680
You're gonna be OK. We can do this.

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:03.760
Hey, trust me.
All right...

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:08.320
look, I don't wanna spoil your little moment, but
we're literally stood next to a ticking bomb.

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:11.400
Danni will be at the south stand
in 10 minutes. Go.

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:17.000
Be careful.

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:21.680
So, the second-half
gets underway.

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:25.480
It's do or die for West Ham.
They have to get more possession

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:28.680
if they're gonna go on and win this
game, and make the final.

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:39.760
Chief, we have him.

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:46.200
I think he is heading towards
the Dynamo stand.

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:48.280
He's going after Dimitri.

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.320
Tatiana, send everyone.

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:54.520
This way. Move. This way. OK.

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:03.120
Fuck.

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:07.560
Are you fucking kidding me? MAN: More
paramedics required in the lower west stand.

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.600
Go!

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:15.000
Whoa! Idiot!

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:18.840
Follow him.

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:28.320
That's £9, please. You pay.

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:35.520
Get the fuck out of the way.

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:37.600
Fuck you!

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:40.160
Fuck off!
Faisal, I need another route.

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:43.600
What gate are you up to?
Nine, ten, coming up to eleven.

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:48.280
What? What's going on? I'm on a
fucking bike. Which way?

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.480
The opposite way. Go now.

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:53.640
Move.

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:56.840
Fuck. Wait! Stop! It's not possible.

01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:59.800
Oh, Jesus!

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:06.440
I'm running out of concourse.
Go up. Go up. Go up.

01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:11.080
No, don't. Double back. Turn around.

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:28.400
Faisal, where now? Get up to the
gantry. You'll see a set of stairs.

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:55.040
Faisal, I see the stairs.

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:57.080
Take them. Take the stairs.
Ah!

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:03.440
I'm on the roof.
You're on the roof?

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:06.440
You said take the stairs.
I meant down, not up.

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:13.920
Knox, there's no way
to get across from there.

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:16.200
That's a 60ft drop.

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:18.560
Just get Danni to the roof.
I'll meet you there.

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:24.360
West Ham are under pressure.
Dynamo are searching forward

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:27.000
as the Russians look to regain the
lead. Come on!

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:37.000
'Bearing down on the goal.
West Ham are in trouble.'

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:43.080
'Ah! He made a right mess of that.'

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:48.640
'He threw that short.'

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:58.960
'The Hammers are trying to wrestle back
control. Oh, there's an opening here.'

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:03.440
'Pushing down the left. Dynamo look
a bit desperate.'

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:10.520
'The Hammers have to take advantage
here. In goes the cross.'

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:21.280
'Hernandez brought down just outside
the box.

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:23.880
It's a free kick
in a very dangerous position.'

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:30.360
'Johnson will take it.

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:32.720
East London holds its breath.'

01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:34.760
'Here we go.'

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:40.720
'Striding in. The shot.'

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:49.720
'It's there!

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:52.040
West Ham take the lead!'

01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:58.400
Damn.

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:20.800
Dimitri Belav.

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:25.400
That's a name I haven't heard
for a very long time.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.840
Viktor, block Knox's key card.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.960
We don't have to. We have eyes on
him. Not for Knox.

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:35.000
For the Asian.

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:41.680
Brother.

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:44.560
I need you to come with me.

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:46.920
I am not missing the game.

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:48.960
I'm not fucking asking.

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:55.160
Come on, Danni. Two minutes.
Where's Uncle Mike?

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:57.920
He'll be here. Don't worry.

01:06:58.040 --> 01:06:59.960
See?

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:05.400
Give me the girl.

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:07.960
No.

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:12.920
I want you to know,
I'm not going to shoot you.

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:19.040
I'm going to kill you
much slower than that.

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:23.840
Move.

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:31.760
Who are you? No-one.

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:34.240
Then, what is this about?
Your brother.

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:37.840
If my brother is here, there is no point
in running. Shut the fuck up and move.

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:40.480
East stand now. East stand now.

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:43.840
Commander Steed, we have
two people to extract.

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:45.880
Primary target is Dimitri Belav.

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:48.800
Agent Cho to ID him.
Head for the extraction point now.

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:51.040
Come on. Let's move.

01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:57.880
Hello. North concourse, now. Move.

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:14.400
Fuck. No.

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:27.720
Go, go, go, go!

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:33.520
Move! Let's go, let's go.
Come on. Move, move, move!

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:38.200
They're trapped.
East concourse toilets.

01:08:38.319 --> 01:08:41.000
There's no way out. Move in.

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:43.040
On me. Forward.

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:52.560
Agent Cho, are you in position?
Affirmative. But where the hell is Knox?

01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:59.359
Shit! Do you have more bullets? No.

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:11.160
You really don't have more bullets,
do you?

01:09:11.319 --> 01:09:14.240
You'll need a detonator.

01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:16.279
How about a phone?

01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:46.359
Pavel?

01:09:46.479 --> 01:09:48.399
Pavel!

01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:57.200
Danni!

01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:59.480
Danni!

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:02.080
Faisal, where the fuck are you?
Where's Danni?

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:06.440
Faisal? Come in.

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:11.600
Where's Danni?
Knox, I'm sorry, man. I lost her.

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:15.680
Knox, you have to send Dimitri up.
We'll come back for the girl.

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:18.240
I'm sorry, Uncle
Mike. I'm sorry.

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:21.560
Danni, where are you? ARKADY: She is
with me, Uncle Mike...

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:27.880
...and she's dead if you take one
more step towards the helicopter.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.160
Knox! You have to send Dimitri up.

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:36.200
I can't do it. Send him up now!
I can't do it. They've got Danni.

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.680
There's gotta be another way.

01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:41.920
We can't let Dimitri
fall into their hands. Take him out.

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:44.560
Do it now, while we have a shot.
We need Dimitri.

01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:46.640
Do not fire.

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:49.480
Hey, ignore that prick.
I have jurisdiction here.

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:51.720
Take the shot,
or face a court martial.

01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:57.520
Take the shot. Yes, sir!

01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:59.560
Move!

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:06.360
Hold your fire. Swing her right.

01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:14.800
Get up. Move, move!

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:19.160
The target is gone.
Dimitri has cleared the roof.

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:21.200
Mike!

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:30.640
You don't miss from that distance
unless it's by intention, right?

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:32.720
Who the fuck do you think you are?

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:35.680
Risking the lives of those people.
This is my thing.

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:39.520
And who are you? A drugged-up met cop who
can't see the wood for the fucking trees.

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:42.560
There's more to this
than a fucking soccer stadium!

01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:45.760
It's not soccer.

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:47.880
It's football.

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:14.680
You'd kill all these innocent people
just to get one person.

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:25.720
Sacrifice is all about respect.

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:31.040
My uncle won't let you
go away with this.

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:33.160
Oh, really?

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:37.160
He will do everything I ask because
of you. Vigilante.

01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:41.760
Vigilante.

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:44.400
You have something I need.

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:47.800
Bring him to me now, or I will let
Tatiana carve up your girl.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.080
If you hurt Danni, I'll put a fucking
bullet in your brother's head right now.

01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:54.840
Clearly, you are
a man of skill and talent.

01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:58.960
I am a man of will. Do not test me.

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:11.520
Ah!

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:42.760
When I was a child,
my father had chickens.

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:46.800
Kept many chickens.

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:49.200
There was one I loved,

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:51.240
and I called her One-eyed Clara...

01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:54.240
...and she was the runt.

01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:57.200
I have a soft spot for the underdog.

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:01.640
One morning, we went out
to the pen...

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:04.720
...to a horrific scene.

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:08.480
Blood, feathers.

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:11.280
A fox had slaughtered three birds.

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:17.520
I was relieved to see that
my beloved Clara was still alive.

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:21.200
However, that night...

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:25.720
...my father took her out in to
the open...

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.960
...chained her to a tree.

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:34.720
Hours passed, until we heard the fox

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:36.760
was ripping Clara apart.

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:41.920
My father aimed his rifle...

01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:45.440
...and bang...

01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:48.840
...killed the fox.

01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:53.680
Clara was dead, and so was the fox.

01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:55.720
The other chickens were safe now.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:02.840
Sometimes, you have to sacrifice
the thing you love the most

01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:04.880
for the greater good.

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:10.120
You think your story is supposed to
teach me something about sacrifice?

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:13.320
Been down that path.

01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:15.360
Me and my best friend.

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:19.120
He was more like a brother to me.

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:22.280
We got together
the best guys we knew.

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:26.240
Fought together
for a couple of years.

01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:28.280
But in Afghanistan...

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:32.680
...I lost my whole team...

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:36.080
...including my brother.

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:40.640
Andy died on my fucking watch.

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:46.760
I'm not gonna lose his daughter, too.

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:53.200
OK, we
do that -

01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:55.880
Dimitri for Danni, but on my terms.

01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:59.040
Make the exchange on the roof.

01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:01.960
You take the north-east corner. I'll
take the north-west.

01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:04.920
A very cold war, checkpoint Charlie.

01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:08.800
You have a deal.

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:11.040
Let's go.

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:13.520
In to the last 15
minutes of the match,

01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:16.040
with West Ham clinging onto
the lead.

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:18.320
Oh, what a shot.
Clawed away by the keeper.

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:37.400
Go.

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:39.480
Tatiana.

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:42.040
Stand over there.

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:50.560
OK. Send him over.

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:56.080
Send Danni first. Give her the kill
switch, and Dimitri is yours.

01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:59.120
One or the other. Not both.

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:07.040
Danni, come on.

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:09.080
You. Go.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.960
Come on, Danni.

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:18.160
No.

01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:21.000
Come on, Danni.
Talk sense to her.

01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:27.440
Danni, listen to me.
You have to do this.

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:35.600
If you give him his brother, Uncle
Mike, he'll kill all these people.

01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:38.840
Danni, please. Get down here.

01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:45.720
I know it was your order,
Uncle Mike.

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:50.120
I know you blame yourself...

01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:52.160
but my dad did what he had to do.

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:56.720
I get it now. He was a hero.

01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:58.840
Danni...

01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:00.920
this isn't the same.

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:03.760
You don't understand.
Get down here, now.

01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:07.360
I do understand.
It wasn't your fault.

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:11.160
People are important and we've gotta
protect their lives...

01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:14.680
...even if it costs us our own.

01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:17.160
Danni, you have to trust me.

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:19.560
Come down here, now.

01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:22.720
No. I refuse to go.

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:25.120
Ah!

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:29.800
The next one is two inches
to the left.

01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:31.840
Go.

01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:38.320
Send Dimitri.

01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:12.200
Dimitri.

01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:25.280
Fire at will.

01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:32.920
Run, Danni, run!

01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:57.000
Down the stairs, now.

01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:03.640
Don't set the kill switch!

01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:05.880
Repeat. Don't set the kill switch!

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:27.920
Ahh!

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:33.360
Brother!

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:42.200
Come on! Get up!

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.920
Come on. Come on.
This way. This way.

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:23.040
Straight on. Go, go.

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:29.400
Come with me.

01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:41.240
Rooftop is clear. Where's Knox?

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:43.280
No eyes on Knox.

01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:45.280
What the fuck is this?

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:48.080
There is no kill switch.

01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:50.160
At 90 minutes,

01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:55.120
you...and the little bitch...
are going to burn.

01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:58.440
How do you stop it?
How do you stop it!?

01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:02.760
There's no way to stop it.

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:04.800
You fucking bitch.

01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:10.520
Fuck you, cupcake.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Dimitri.

01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:34.040
Look at you, brother.
How you have changed.

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:37.520
Why do you run from me?

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:41.280
I have planned this moment
for such a long time.

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:45.000
Long...time.

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:48.440
You were expecting me to kill you.

01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:52.200
Brother.

01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:02.120
I know, brother. Please, sit.

01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:05.120
Viktor, prepare the broadcast.

01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:11.000
You know, when I first heard that

01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:13.200
you were not dead, I - You must have
felt angry.

01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:16.320
Betrayed.

01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:18.560
Uh, at first,

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:21.920
but then I saw the true reason
you went into hiding.

01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:26.000
The smartest thing to do
to beat them and kill them.

01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:28.200
It's because you knew the revolution

01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:31.360
would be reborn one day.
Dimitri Belav is dead.

01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:34.920
And he will rise from the ashes
like a phoenix.

01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:37.960
As soon as our people
see you are alive,

01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:41.120
the revolution will start again,

01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:44.040
and this time, we will win.

01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:46.280
Sir, we are ready to broadcast.

01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:50.160
Look, at home, the people await you.

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:56.360
They will not follow just me,
but you...

01:24:56.520 --> 01:25:00.440
you, they will follow
through the gates of hell itself...

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.560
...and together...
we will take back our country,

01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:08.600
and give it to the people.

01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:12.680
This was your dream.

01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:16.920
Now, what would you give
to see that dream realised?

01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:21.920
Anything. Anything.

01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:27.520
Prove it.

01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:32.440
Kill the girl.

01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:35.680
Together, we will finish
the revolution.

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:47.640
Please.

01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:50.760
You are right about many things,
Arkady.

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:54.640
We fought so very hard
for our country.

01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:57.120
We almost destroyed it.

01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:01.000
But I kept you alive,
not to wait for this moment...

01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:04.440
...but because I love you.

01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:08.640
I could never kill you.

01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:15.200
This is the only way I can stop you
from destroying our home.

01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:17.920
No, no, no! No!

01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:28.600
Arkady, we need to get out of here.
Arkady...

01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:33.240
No!

01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:37.800
Just under five minutes left. West Ham
are clinging on. They're under pressure.

01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:40.120
Can they hold on, find
the willpower now?

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:43.000
Faisal. Come in, Faisal.
Do you have Danni?

01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:46.800
Negative. She didn't come out.
Neither did Dimitri.

01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:49.040
Do you know where she is?
I don't know.

01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:52.320
Faisal, listen to me.
The kill switch was a fake.

01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:56.480
I can't stop it. The C-4 is gonna
detonate at 90 minutes.

01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:59.040
You what? That's in four minutes!

01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:02.560
You gotta get everyone
out of the stand, now! It's on you.

01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:04.960
Steed, do you have eyes on Danni?

01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:07.280
Negative. The roof is clear.

01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:14.400
Oi, sit down!

01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:17.800
Everyone from block G to block N,

01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:21.760
please evacuate your seats
and move away from the corner.

01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:24.240
Fuck off!
Get out the fucking way!

01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:26.840
Oh, that's a cynical
foul.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.200
Tempers are really fraying now,
both on and off the field.

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:33.240
West Ham have had enough.

01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:40.480
'It's time for them to try and put this one
to bed.' Please, you need to move. Ah!

01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:44.800
Knox! Faisal, get everyone
out of the stands, now!

01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:51.320
Faisal Khan, Faisal Khan,
Faisal Khan, Faisal Khan!

01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:53.400
Fuck him.

01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:56.880
Allahu Akbar!

01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:00.560
I have a bomb! I have a bomb!

01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:05.920
Oh, no, that looks like
a bit of crowd trouble there.

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:09.960
I hope it's nothing too serious,
because we're just seconds away.

01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:13.280
Faisal, do you see Danni?
No, I haven't found her.

01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:16.600
Get out! Now! Copy that.

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:20.160
I think we're nearly clear.
Make you way towards the exit.

01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:22.880
Hey! Hey!

01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:27.640
Oh, fuck it. Madam!

01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:32.000
Danni. ARKADY: People of the west...

01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:36.880
...I came here to reignite
a revolution...

01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:41.720
...to bring back to my country
the leader it needs,

01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:45.000
Dimitri Belav. No, no, no!

01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:48.240
Oh, there's someone running
onto the pitch. Chaos here.

01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:51.640
Steed, they're gonna blow
the stadium!

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:53.760
No! Stop! Get away from the corner.

01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:56.360
He's got Danni in the control room.

01:28:56.520 --> 01:29:01.160
But you have given me
something much more important.

01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:08.400
And tonight, you will all learn
the true meaning of sacrifice!

01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:13.080
Danni!

01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:34.240
Blow the gates. Let these people
out.

01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:38.680
Come on! Go, go, go!

01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:44.120
Coming through.

01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:47.520
Keep moving!

01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:49.880
Danni!

01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:55.120
Danni!

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000
{\an8}chebinhdan.com

01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:54.120
85 minutes.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.960
Steed. Knox? The videos are fake.
What?

01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:07.600
It's pre-recorded.
Arkady's still alive. He's got Danni.

01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:11.960
I've got thousands of people
spilling out. I can't stop them.

01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:14.000
Danni!

01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:16.360
Danni!

01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:20.600
Uncle Mike! Uncle Mike!

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:26.440
Danni! Uncle Mike! Help!

01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:32.200
Uncle Mike! Danni!

01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:37.360
Uncle Mike! Help!

01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:39.400
Drop that gun!

01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:42.840
Drop it, or I'll fucking shoot her
right here.

01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:50.840
Danni, be smart. Use your head.

01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:54.160
Use your head, Danni.

01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:57.400
Fuck you, Uncle Mike.

01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:00.880
Uncle Mike.

01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:24.320
Uncle Mike. You're OK. You're OK.

01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:28.520
Where's Faisal?

01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:37.160
Madam. Oh.

01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:39.800
Madam, don't worry about a thing.

01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:42.320
We had a tried and tested

01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:45.280
complaints handling procedure
here at West Ham.

01:32:45.440 --> 01:32:47.880
Thank you. Faisal!
That's all right.

01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:51.680
Faisal. WOMAN: What's your name?

01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:53.800
Faisal. Faisal Khan. Faisal.

01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:57.840
Hey, man. It's good to see you.

01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:02.800
Oh! That's too tight.
That's way too tight.

01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:07.480
Thank you.
Hey, don't mention it, man.

01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:09.640
Danni!

01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:11.800
Mum? Mum!

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:14.280
Danni!

01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:18.360
Baby, I thought I'd lost
you.

01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:22.040
I'm so sorry, Mum. I'm so sorry.

01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:24.160
Are you OK?

01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:26.200
Hey.

01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:29.840
Thank you.

01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:32.000
Andy would have been proud of her.

01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:34.040
He'd be proud of you both.

01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:39.600
Thanks for your help, Knox,
but do me a favour.

01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:42.640
If we reach the final, stay at home.

01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:45.280
Hell, yeah.

01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:49.280
Faisal, let's get out of here, buddy.

01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:53.640
Yeah. DANNI: Come on, big fucker.
Watch your language, little shit.

01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:58.440
Are you all right? WOMAN: Yeah. The ironic thing
is, I don't even like football. Oh, well.
