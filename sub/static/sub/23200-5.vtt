00:50.175 --> 00:53.595
Some of you been Wondering
Why they call me Infra Red.

00:53.678 --> 00:55.680
Well, you see, it's light...

00:55.764 --> 00:57.891
and I'm into light.

00:58.099 --> 01:02.103
The Whole human cosmic experience,
yes, indeed.

01:02.187 --> 01:04.688
Infrared is also invincible...

01:04.772 --> 01:07.400
and that's sort of like I am up here.

01:07.984 --> 01:09.694
Yes, indeed. You understand?

01:10.695 --> 01:15.491
I tell you. Also, if you use
too much of it, you burn, baby, burn!

01:50.902 --> 01:52.570
He's pretty good.

01:52.945 --> 01:54.923
Don't sell yourself short.

01:54.983 --> 01:57.867
I've got a feeling there's
more to you than meets the eye.

02:09.086 --> 02:12.798
Kathy, Anthony! You're becoming
quite a regular here, I see.

02:13.382 --> 02:17.094
It's only my second time in, Angelique.
This is still pretty fast company...

02:17.178 --> 02:19.221
for a mundane engineer like me.

02:19.305 --> 02:22.600
Nonsense. Every group needs new blood...

02:22.683 --> 02:24.226
every now and then.

02:24.727 --> 02:26.478
Enjoy your evening.

02:28.189 --> 02:32.234
Angelique keeps a few rooms in back
for the entertainment of her more...

02:32.318 --> 02:34.778
special customers. You interested?

03:09.771 --> 03:10.981
Kathy?

03:25.495 --> 03:27.748
Don't worry about her, Tony, she's fine.

03:28.123 --> 03:29.791
How did you know my name?

03:29.875 --> 03:33.211
Relax, man. I want to talk to you
about your work.

03:37.966 --> 03:40.552
Let me take some of that load
off your mind, Tony.

03:40.635 --> 03:43.680
All the secrets
that are making you so uptight.

05:16.188 --> 05:19.066
We've taken every precaution.
The base has been evacuated...

05:19.150 --> 05:20.901
we do have nuclear shielding.

05:20.985 --> 05:24.238
Your fail-safe engineer is the only one
who can deactivate the bomb?

05:24.321 --> 05:25.573
It's an experimental model.

05:25.656 --> 05:28.534
Borden is the only person
in 100 miles who can handle it.

05:28.617 --> 05:30.077
That's fine, but where is he?

05:30.161 --> 05:31.871
He'll be here any minute.

05:31.954 --> 05:35.583
He'd better be, Colonel, or your camp
could wind up glowing in the dark...

05:35.666 --> 05:37.793
for the next 500 years.

05:38.586 --> 05:40.546
The smaller one, that's the detonator?

05:40.629 --> 05:42.214
Yes, it's the prototype model...

05:42.298 --> 05:46.218
designed to shoot a stream of
supercharged ions to the bomb chamber.

05:46.302 --> 05:49.096
We hope to use it for
remote triggering of nuclear missiles...

05:49.179 --> 05:51.557
at a range of 50 miles or more.

05:51.640 --> 05:53.934
Lovely. Death by long distance.

05:58.105 --> 06:00.566
Colonel! How long till detonation?

06:01.275 --> 06:04.736
- Got less than two minutes.
- You don't give a man much time, do you?

06:09.825 --> 06:12.411
Borden's the best nuclear engineer
on the East Coast.

06:12.494 --> 06:15.205
He knows this particular detonator
inside out.

06:27.801 --> 06:29.469
I've located the trouble.

06:29.553 --> 06:33.140
For some reason, it's scrambling
all incoming commands to disarm.

06:33.223 --> 06:35.475
It'll respond to the master code, won't it?

06:35.559 --> 06:38.645
It should. As long as it's fed
in the proper sequence.

06:38.728 --> 06:41.815
So feed it in, man!
That's what you're here for!

06:42.607 --> 06:45.235
Take it easy, the sequence has to be right.

06:45.318 --> 06:46.611
Twenty-four...

06:47.195 --> 06:48.488
thirty-two?

06:48.697 --> 06:49.781
No!

06:51.366 --> 06:52.659
Thirty...

06:53.493 --> 06:54.661
three!

06:58.623 --> 07:01.293
- Borden, will you feed in that code?
- Give me a minute!

07:01.376 --> 07:03.294
We haven't got a minute!

07:09.217 --> 07:10.844
I can't remember.

07:11.761 --> 07:15.640
I don't know what's the matter with me.
I just can't remember.

07:17.851 --> 07:20.228
I suggest we head for that shielding.

07:20.311 --> 07:22.355
Gentlemen, inside. Move it!

08:05.731 --> 08:09.485
What's wrong with you? If it wasn't for
Wonder Woman, we would've been killed!

08:09.569 --> 08:12.029
- It's gone, all gone.
- What is all gone?

08:12.113 --> 08:16.325
The code, the numbers, everything
that mattered. It's gone from my mind!

08:16.450 --> 08:18.995
I can't remember anything.
The sequence...

08:19.203 --> 08:21.580
I knew it as well as my own name.

08:21.706 --> 08:23.833
24, 32.

08:25.084 --> 08:26.168
No!

08:27.420 --> 08:30.339
33, 41?

08:34.426 --> 08:37.263
55...

08:37.804 --> 08:39.222
63...

08:39.932 --> 08:41.392
89...

08:41.976 --> 08:44.186
22, 7.

08:46.981 --> 08:49.817
Go on, Nick.
The buyer for this tape is waiting.

08:50.818 --> 08:52.736
lonic field density...

08:53.278 --> 08:57.491
varies with the relative distance between
the bomb chamber and detonator...

08:58.659 --> 09:02.579
becoming ineffectual
at a distance of 1.2 kilometers.

09:03.789 --> 09:06.625
You did say I had tonight off, didn't you?

09:07.126 --> 09:09.002
Tomorrow night. Maybe.

09:09.169 --> 09:12.923
Tonight, one of my guests is a man
who designs military satellites.

09:13.006 --> 09:16.802
There's a lot of money at stake.
We must entertain him properly.

09:18.428 --> 09:21.807
Okay. I'll probe his mind, then I'll split.
I've a life of my own to lead.

09:21.890 --> 09:23.141
Oh, I know.

09:27.437 --> 09:32.025
The detonator uses radio signals
at the following frequencies.

09:34.152 --> 09:36.655
Not only was the classified data gone...

09:36.780 --> 09:39.282
but the doctors say Borden
cannot remember one thing...

09:39.366 --> 09:41.618
that happened in the past 24 hours.

09:41.701 --> 09:45.956
- That's a pretty selective case of amnesia.
- No drugs found in his bloodstream.

09:46.039 --> 09:49.793
No evidence of surgery or brainwashing.
It's as though someone just...

09:49.876 --> 09:53.797
- lifted the memories right out of his mind.
- Yeah, but it's possible.

09:53.922 --> 09:55.632
You mean telepathy? Something like that?

09:55.966 --> 10:00.387
We can't discount it. Ira's been collecting
data on paranormal research.

10:00.637 --> 10:02.514
It's a pet project of his.

10:02.597 --> 10:06.309
He's trying to find evidence that
human beings have greater potential...

10:06.393 --> 10:08.520
than what we've demonstrated so far.

10:08.603 --> 10:11.856
We aren't sterling examples
of the human condition?

10:12.232 --> 10:14.275
Hard to believe, isn't it?

10:17.821 --> 10:21.366
You may be interested in a call I received
from some friends of mine...

10:21.449 --> 10:23.034
at the naval hospital.

10:23.118 --> 10:25.870
It seems that Anthony Borden
was admitted this morning...

10:25.954 --> 10:29.457
suffering from a particularly
baffling kind of amnesia.

10:30.124 --> 10:31.668
- Is that right?
- Yes.

10:31.751 --> 10:34.546
Seems that he's unable
to remember a thing...

10:34.629 --> 10:36.881
that happened to him in the last 24 hours.

10:36.965 --> 10:38.007
So?

10:38.633 --> 10:40.760
So, my little disco devil...

10:41.344 --> 10:45.181
it would seem that somebody
had botched his job, wouldn't it?

10:45.932 --> 10:48.434
- I got the information, didn't I?
- That's very true.

10:48.518 --> 10:52.480
And that's all you were supposed to
steal from his mind. The information.

10:52.563 --> 10:55.691
You weren't supposed to
wipe out 24 hours.

10:55.775 --> 10:57.944
I did the job. So who cares?

10:58.986 --> 11:01.364
The IADC cares.

11:01.697 --> 11:05.451
One of their agents, Diana Prince,
brought Borden to the hospital.

11:05.576 --> 11:06.828
So what?

11:07.578 --> 11:11.207
They're not going to get anything
out of him. All the evidence is in my head.

11:11.290 --> 11:13.042
You worry too much, Angie.

11:13.209 --> 11:15.878
Don't you ever call me that name again.

11:18.381 --> 11:19.715
Pardon me.

11:20.091 --> 11:21.467
Angelique.

11:26.013 --> 11:29.892
I want you to follow the Prince woman.
Find out what she knows.

11:29.975 --> 11:31.936
Keep a discreet distance.

11:32.686 --> 11:34.897
Sure. I can get behind that.

11:38.150 --> 11:42.321
Statistics shoW that most paranormal
abilities are mental, not physical.

11:42.613 --> 11:45.616
Telepathy, telekinesis, astral projection.

11:45.908 --> 11:49.828
What about the ability to remove
memories from someone's mind?

11:50.162 --> 11:52.998
Memory transfer is far more rare
but not unknoWn.

11:53.249 --> 11:55.250
Please examine photos 3A...

11:55.334 --> 11:57.878
4B, 5C and 7F...

11:59.588 --> 12:01.799
of the four memory telepaths discovered...

12:01.882 --> 12:04.551
at the Virginia Institute
for Paranormal Research.

12:04.635 --> 12:07.554
Only tWo, 3A, 7F...

12:07.930 --> 12:12.684
possess psychic poWers capable of lea ving
an amnesiac void like you describe.

12:12.893 --> 12:15.979
Nicholas Carbone and Del Franklin.

12:16.647 --> 12:18.649
Do you have a location on these two?

12:18.732 --> 12:22.361
Nicholas Carbone Was reported killed
in a gang War tWo years ago.

12:22.444 --> 12:24.279
Delbert Franklin Works for...

12:24.363 --> 12:26.365
the Inter-City Trucking Company
in Washington.

12:26.448 --> 12:28.659
- You think he's our man?
- Negative.

12:28.867 --> 12:31.954
I doubt that someone Who steals
classified data Would ha ve been...

12:32.037 --> 12:35.791
employed as a fry cook, a taxi driver,
a sales clerk and a sanitary engineer...

12:35.874 --> 12:39.127
for the Arlington public zoo,
all in the last year alone.

12:39.211 --> 12:43.423
Well, hopefully, he'll stay employed at
the trucking company long enough...

12:43.507 --> 12:45.133
for me to check him out.

12:45.217 --> 12:47.302
Thank you, Ira, good night.

12:58.355 --> 13:01.483
Del Franklin? He works here.
What did he do this time?

13:02.108 --> 13:05.195
Nothing, Mr. Taylor,
I just want to talk to him.

13:06.154 --> 13:09.699
Come on, what did he do,
run over the Secretary of State?

13:10.283 --> 13:13.078
No, I just want to speak to him.
Thank you.

13:21.795 --> 13:23.338
Hey! Franklin!

13:24.839 --> 13:25.924
Yes?

13:26.174 --> 13:29.552
Somebody here to see you!
Park that rig and come over here!

13:54.994 --> 13:56.829
Franklin, your truck!

14:29.236 --> 14:32.073
Three months on the job and you still
don't know how to brake a truck?

14:32.156 --> 14:34.533
I'm sorry, Mr. Taylor.
It'll never happen again.

14:34.617 --> 14:37.912
You said that when you dropped
the oranges on the Maryland Parkway...

14:37.995 --> 14:40.623
and when you rear-ended
the owner's car with your car!

14:40.706 --> 14:44.418
I'm sick of hearing you say that, Franklin!
You're through.

14:45.836 --> 14:48.297
You pick your check up on the way out.

14:50.925 --> 14:52.384
Mr. Franklin?

14:52.468 --> 14:55.012
Yeah, you from the insurance company?

14:56.388 --> 15:00.976
No, I'm Diana Prince, I'm from the IADC,
and I would like to talk to you.

15:01.810 --> 15:05.689
Sure. Like the man said, I'm not exactly
on a tight schedule.

15:14.073 --> 15:16.992
This is the fifth straight job you've lost?

15:18.744 --> 15:20.245
What's wrong?

15:20.496 --> 15:22.873
I don't know. They say that I can't...

15:23.123 --> 15:24.791
focus on my work.

15:26.293 --> 15:29.087
I don't focus on my energy,
whatever that means.

15:29.171 --> 15:31.798
If they knew what my real problem was...

15:32.090 --> 15:33.634
they'd freak!

15:33.717 --> 15:35.594
Your psychic abilities?

15:38.388 --> 15:39.681
You know?

15:40.974 --> 15:42.684
That's why I'm here.

15:42.768 --> 15:45.937
Well, I guess you think
like everybody else does at the Institute...

15:46.021 --> 15:48.565
that I'm this lucky guy.

15:49.941 --> 15:51.735
You got to think again.

15:51.818 --> 15:55.072
How can I live with my conscience
knowing that I can...

15:55.155 --> 15:57.908
steal bits and pieces of peoples' lives?

15:58.033 --> 16:01.620
Seems to me that you could put your
powers to good use somehow.

16:01.745 --> 16:03.246
You think so?

16:03.955 --> 16:05.957
Let me give you a demonstration.

16:06.041 --> 16:09.544
Think of someone you know, a friend,
co-worker, anybody.

16:09.836 --> 16:10.962
Okay.

16:11.421 --> 16:13.965
I want you to think of their face...

16:15.008 --> 16:17.385
I want you to think of their voice...

16:17.469 --> 16:19.137
where they work...

16:20.180 --> 16:21.806
how they walk.

16:39.032 --> 16:40.867
Who did you think of?

16:41.868 --> 16:43.244
I can't remember.

16:43.494 --> 16:46.122
Well, I can. His name is Steve Trevor.

16:46.623 --> 16:48.666
He's your boss at the IADC.

16:48.750 --> 16:52.003
He is tall, he has dark hair,
he's built like a football player and...

16:52.086 --> 16:55.506
he has his office next to yours,
and I hate him already.

16:56.215 --> 16:57.634
You lifted...

16:57.842 --> 17:00.511
that entire memory right from my mind.

17:00.887 --> 17:02.847
That's right, Miss Prince.

17:03.473 --> 17:05.683
I stole a piece of your life.

17:06.142 --> 17:09.686
It might've been only a second,
but what right do I have to do that?

17:09.771 --> 17:12.857
- Are you interested in a job?
- Yeah. What kind?

17:13.191 --> 17:16.152
It's an investigation.
It could be dangerous.

17:16.277 --> 17:18.905
What do I have to lose but another job?

17:19.821 --> 17:20.906
Good.

17:21.531 --> 17:23.826
First, I want you to call me Diana...

17:23.951 --> 17:26.454
and, secondly, I want you to report
tomorrow morning...

17:26.537 --> 17:28.414
at the IADC at 9:00 a. m.

17:29.040 --> 17:32.001
In the meantime,
if you have any questions...

17:32.084 --> 17:34.712
that's my home phone number
and address.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.547
- Okay?
- Okay.

17:50.811 --> 17:52.771
Del? Are you okay?

17:54.482 --> 17:57.610
The weirdest flash
just went through my mind.

17:57.735 --> 17:59.778
Are you a member of the...

18:00.029 --> 18:02.531
bomb squad of the IADC?

18:04.241 --> 18:05.784
Of course not.

18:07.870 --> 18:11.915
Sometimes it seems that way, but...
I'll see you tomorrow at 9:00.

18:12.958 --> 18:14.877
- Okay?
- Right.

18:29.433 --> 18:31.393
The guy's a real klutz.

18:31.560 --> 18:34.188
I can't figure out what she'd want
with a guy like that.

18:34.271 --> 18:37.232
His name is Franklin. Del Franklin.

18:38.150 --> 18:41.236
- Did you say Del Franklin?
- Yeah. You know him?

18:43.697 --> 18:47.159
Yeah. We both tested
at that cheesy institute together.

18:47.409 --> 18:49.077
He's a paranormal?

18:49.745 --> 18:51.747
- Yeah.
- What's his talent?

18:52.080 --> 18:55.042
Same as mine
but not as strong, undeveloped.

18:55.208 --> 18:57.127
Could he pose a threat to us?

18:57.210 --> 18:59.963
He might be able to turn up something
in Borden's mind...

19:00.046 --> 19:02.048
probe his subconscious, maybe.

19:02.132 --> 19:05.760
All right, can you handle him
if we get him here tonight?

19:05.844 --> 19:08.930
- Ain't no one I can't handle.
- As for the Prince woman...

19:09.014 --> 19:11.766
we can't exactly invite her
to the Styx, too.

19:11.933 --> 19:15.353
The wisest move would be
to eliminate her straight away.

19:15.437 --> 19:17.314
Don't you think, Lance?

19:22.444 --> 19:25.196
Excuse me, sir. Could you give me a hand?

19:25.405 --> 19:29.784
It made this terrible gasping noise,
then it died. Could you take look?

19:29.868 --> 19:32.245
I don't really know much about all that.

19:32.328 --> 19:34.956
Please. Just one look. Just try.

19:37.917 --> 19:39.419
Well, let's see...

19:40.628 --> 19:43.089
looks like the engine, all right.

19:43.465 --> 19:46.926
Maybe if you just
fiddled around with it a little bit.

19:47.468 --> 19:50.138
- Maybe if I-
- Don't touch that! I mean...

19:50.221 --> 19:52.640
it just looked really dangerous to me.

19:53.057 --> 19:55.143
What about that thingamajig down there?

19:55.226 --> 19:58.146
- This, you mean the spark plug?
- Spark plugs.

19:58.855 --> 20:00.315
It was loose.

20:01.941 --> 20:03.151
There you go.

20:03.234 --> 20:05.528
- Can I try it?
- Give it a go!

20:22.962 --> 20:25.006
Thank you, really, a lot.

20:25.173 --> 20:28.676
- I don't know how to repay you.
- You don't have to at all.

20:28.885 --> 20:31.178
I know! Are you busy tonight?

20:32.179 --> 20:33.222
No!

20:34.098 --> 20:38.352
I work at the Styx, it's a very exclusive
disco. You might have heard of it.

20:38.686 --> 20:42.940
I'd love for you to come as my guest,
then later we could go for a drink?

20:44.692 --> 20:46.360
My name's Kathy.

20:47.194 --> 20:49.363
Here you go. Just ask for me at the door.

20:50.656 --> 20:52.658
I don't know your name.

20:52.992 --> 20:54.702
I'm Del. Del Franklin.

20:57.329 --> 20:59.790
- Then I'll see you tonight?
- Great!

21:11.385 --> 21:13.387
Maybe my luck is changing.

21:30.112 --> 21:33.574
Just loosen up. Just go
where your feet take you.

21:34.700 --> 21:36.785
Come on. There you go.

21:43.417 --> 21:47.504
I don't know about you, Steve,
but I'm packing it in for the night.

21:48.755 --> 21:49.923
Steve!

21:51.300 --> 21:52.342
How do you like that.

21:52.426 --> 21:56.263
All this devotion to duty
and no one around to appreciate it.

21:58.598 --> 22:00.767
Now you know, just do some of this.

22:00.851 --> 22:01.935
Some of what?

22:02.018 --> 22:04.980
- Just turn around.
- Now watch this.

22:05.230 --> 22:07.023
Ready, set...

22:09.276 --> 22:12.654
I really am sorry!
I hope I didn't wrinkle your shirt?

22:12.737 --> 22:15.907
I'll wrinkle your face if you don't
stop jumping all over the floor.

22:15.991 --> 22:18.618
Were you dancing or having a spasm?

22:20.120 --> 22:22.080
Let's sit this one out.

22:23.873 --> 22:25.959
We get guys like that all the time in here.

22:26.042 --> 22:28.837
Really unmellow.
Don't let it get you down.

22:30.422 --> 22:32.173
I don't belong here.

22:32.257 --> 22:36.636
I don't know where I really do belong,
but I know one thing, it's not in here.

22:36.845 --> 22:38.138
Listen, there are...

22:38.221 --> 22:41.433
a few quiet rooms in the back,
maybe you and I could...

22:42.684 --> 22:45.145
You've got better things to do
than listen to me.

22:45.228 --> 22:47.772
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna leave now.

22:48.731 --> 22:52.235
Thanks for inviting me,
and you're really a very nice girl...

22:52.318 --> 22:54.612
but I'm sorry, I'm just no fun.

22:54.863 --> 22:56.155
But wait!

23:02.954 --> 23:05.623
- Where is he going?
- He walked out on me.

23:05.707 --> 23:08.334
I can't believe it! He walked out on me!

23:08.543 --> 23:11.421
Well, he's got taste, I'll give him that.

23:14.799 --> 23:16.217
Get him back.

23:16.509 --> 23:18.511
Preferably in one piece.

23:31.566 --> 23:33.526
Good evening, Miss Prince.

23:51.043 --> 23:52.753
Del, what are you doing here?

23:52.837 --> 23:56.632
Some clown tried to force me off the road,
then he ran into a fire hydrant...

23:56.715 --> 24:00.261
I just hightailed it over here.
I didn't know where else to go.

24:00.344 --> 24:03.347
Well, I've run into a small problem
of my own!

24:21.615 --> 24:24.702
- What are you doing here?
- Long story. I got to take him back.

24:24.785 --> 24:28.580
So take him. I'll finish my business
with her. Let's go, lady.

24:29.581 --> 24:32.209
I need a car. Mine died getting here.

24:33.419 --> 24:37.589
Take my car. It's in the parking
garage across the street. And wait for me.

24:37.673 --> 24:39.758
This won't take very long.

24:39.883 --> 24:42.928
Come on, Mr. Franklin,
nobody's going to hurt you.

24:46.098 --> 24:49.142
You, you're a different story. Let's go.

25:08.120 --> 25:10.789
I get car sick if I sit
in the passenger seat.

25:10.872 --> 25:12.666
Shut up. Keep moving.

25:14.376 --> 25:16.294
Do you mind if I ask you a question?

25:16.378 --> 25:19.589
Like, who do I work for,
what do I do, that kind of thing?

25:19.673 --> 25:23.301
- No. Where do you buy your shirts?
- You're a very funny lady.

25:23.385 --> 25:26.346
Too bad the world will be
losing such dry wit.

25:26.846 --> 25:30.183
You're going to kill me
without even telling me why?

25:31.226 --> 25:33.061
That's not very fair.

25:33.144 --> 25:35.021
Few things in life are.

25:44.989 --> 25:48.993
My associate will be here in a minute.
You don't mind waiting, do you?

25:49.077 --> 25:51.037
The question is, do you?

25:58.169 --> 25:59.671
Del, get out.

26:28.783 --> 26:30.326
Go after them!

26:30.576 --> 26:33.329
- No, it's all right.
- But they just killed Diana.

26:33.412 --> 26:36.624
She's fine.
She's the one who sent me here.

26:36.707 --> 26:39.544
The important thing is
they didn't get to you.

26:39.627 --> 26:43.422
What do they want me for?
Why am I so popular all of a sudden?

26:43.756 --> 26:46.342
Obviously, someone doesn't want you...

26:46.425 --> 26:48.928
to help the IADC in its investigation.

26:49.220 --> 26:52.056
Diana said this was going to be dangerous.

26:53.265 --> 26:56.519
I almost lost this job
without even having to report for work.

26:56.602 --> 26:58.229
Which is why...

26:58.479 --> 27:02.316
the IADC had better make some
special arrangements for you.

27:14.161 --> 27:16.247
Ritzy little place, isn't it?

27:16.330 --> 27:19.416
It's not much, but at least
you'll be safe here.

27:19.625 --> 27:22.127
We've got two men in the lobby,
24 hours a day.

27:22.211 --> 27:25.297
- I didn't see anybody.
- You weren't supposed to.

27:25.381 --> 27:27.549
How long do I have to stay in here?

27:27.716 --> 27:30.052
As long as it takes to clear this up.

27:30.135 --> 27:32.846
You can help us by checking someone out.

27:33.013 --> 27:36.350
Seems like top secret information
has just vanished from his mind.

27:36.433 --> 27:38.811
I'll bring him by in the morning.

27:41.396 --> 27:43.524
That means Diana might be here?

27:43.857 --> 27:47.861
Afraid not. It looks like whoever's
after you found out about you through her.

27:47.945 --> 27:51.281
She thought it best if I didn't tell her
where you were being guarded.

27:51.365 --> 27:52.950
You mean imprisoned.

27:53.867 --> 27:57.162
I send you out to get one woman
and one dummy...

27:57.246 --> 28:00.249
and you come back
with your tails between your legs.

28:00.332 --> 28:03.877
The IADC has this Franklin person
in protective custody by now.

28:05.003 --> 28:07.506
Any ideas how we're going to get him out?

28:08.090 --> 28:09.466
I've got one.

28:12.469 --> 28:14.304
We start doing things my way.

28:16.640 --> 28:20.185
Think of somebody
that neither of us could possibly know.

28:21.019 --> 28:22.687
Think of a face...

28:23.647 --> 28:24.898
their voice...

28:26.024 --> 28:27.526
their walk.

28:35.992 --> 28:37.494
24...

28:38.328 --> 28:39.704
brunette...

28:40.622 --> 28:42.123
green eyes.

28:43.792 --> 28:45.877
I think her name is Colleen.

28:45.960 --> 28:47.629
That's my fiancée!

28:48.630 --> 28:51.257
Looks like we've got another believer.

28:51.424 --> 28:54.469
All right, Mr. Borden, I want you to relax.

29:00.099 --> 29:01.559
Let me in...

29:03.394 --> 29:04.687
deeper.

29:23.706 --> 29:26.000
What's wrong, what did you see?

29:26.292 --> 29:27.835
Nick Carbone.

29:29.087 --> 29:32.173
The other telepath?
Diana said he was killed.

29:32.590 --> 29:35.301
Probably what he wanted people to think.

29:35.635 --> 29:38.763
Colonel, I think we've got our answer.

29:42.934 --> 29:44.894
Here it is. The Styx.

29:45.519 --> 29:48.814
Its owner is a wealthy socialite
named Angelique McKenna.

29:48.940 --> 29:52.193
It's become a sort of Watering hole
for Washington bigWigs.

29:52.276 --> 29:55.946
Providing them access to government
officials, from whom Nick Carbone...

29:56.030 --> 29:57.948
rips off classified data.

29:58.949 --> 30:00.451
Perfect cover.

30:00.701 --> 30:04.955
Who'd suspect a disco fronting
for a black market information broker?

30:05.373 --> 30:08.918
I say we get a warrant
and turn this over to the police.

30:09.293 --> 30:12.630
Just a second, Diana.
This is all still speculation.

30:12.797 --> 30:15.633
To get a warrant,
we have to have evidence for a judge.

30:15.716 --> 30:18.219
What are we going to present: Del?

30:18.969 --> 30:22.973
You're right. Telepathy isn't exactly
admissible in court, is it?

30:23.307 --> 30:26.936
You should talk this over with John Wright
in the Attorney General's office.

30:27.019 --> 30:29.521
I'll talk to you When you get back.

30:31.690 --> 30:35.778
Are you still here? I thought you said
you'd have Franklin taken care of by noon.

30:35.861 --> 30:37.946
It's only 11:30.

30:38.113 --> 30:39.698
Nick. Let's go.

30:40.657 --> 30:42.993
Besides, my chauffeur was late.

30:57.174 --> 31:00.344
Good morning. I'd like to see
Diana Prince, please.

31:00.427 --> 31:03.222
I'm sorry, she's not in.
May I take a message?

31:03.472 --> 31:06.266
No, it's fairly important.
Who's her immediate supervisor?

31:06.350 --> 31:09.353
I'm sorry, I can't give you
that information.

31:12.689 --> 31:13.940
Well...

31:25.494 --> 31:28.622
Nice meeting you.
Too bad you won't remember it.

31:41.676 --> 31:43.428
Excuse me, can you...

32:01.529 --> 32:03.323
- Col. Trevor?
- Yes.

32:04.783 --> 32:08.244
I'm from Gen. Markessen's office.
I have some documents for you.

32:08.328 --> 32:11.164
Documents? I wasn't expecting a delivery.

32:16.169 --> 32:18.922
There's been a mistake.
These weren't intended for me.

32:19.005 --> 32:22.759
Maybe they were meant for Mr. Franklin.
Mr. Del Franklin.

32:27.472 --> 32:30.141
- Just who are you, anyway?
- Just relax.

32:37.231 --> 32:41.152
At least you'll be safe here. We've got
tWo men in the lobby, 24 hours a day.

33:07.720 --> 33:10.723
They got him stashed
in some sleazy little place downtown.

33:10.806 --> 33:14.518
You go up and get Franklin, and I'll take
care of the two agents in the lobby.

33:14.602 --> 33:18.773
Why don't you get Franklin and I take
care of the guys in the lobby?

33:19.356 --> 33:23.402
Or maybe you don't want to meet this
Franklin guy for some reason?

33:24.987 --> 33:27.907
You're real stupid, you know that,
Lance boy?

33:28.699 --> 33:30.117
Real stupid.

33:30.826 --> 33:32.703
Now shut up and drive.

33:43.255 --> 33:47.384
I'm back. Wait till you hear what
the Attorney General's office said.

33:47.885 --> 33:49.803
- About what?
- About Del.

33:50.304 --> 33:51.555
Del who?

33:52.598 --> 33:57.019
What do you mean, Del who?
The guy you've got under lock and key.

33:59.229 --> 34:02.357
Diana, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

34:02.441 --> 34:05.027
Oh, come on, Steve, you're the one who...

34:07.738 --> 34:08.947
Oh, no.

34:26.505 --> 34:28.425
Are you sure this is the right number?

34:28.507 --> 34:31.594
If what you say is true, and there's
someone in our safe house...

34:31.678 --> 34:34.431
you didn't know about, that's the number.

34:38.101 --> 34:39.728
He's not there.

34:50.196 --> 34:54.159
Good afternoon, Mr. Franklin.
Welcome back. Where's Nick?

34:54.617 --> 34:56.119
He isn't here?

34:56.786 --> 35:00.582
He took care of the IADC agents,
then split. Told me he'd be here.

35:00.665 --> 35:04.461
How odd. Almost as if he didn't want
to face Mr. Franklin.

35:08.047 --> 35:11.009
I'm the kind of man
that likes to be prepared.

35:11.468 --> 35:14.304
Can somebody tell me
what's going on around here?

35:14.387 --> 35:17.140
You can prepare by saying a few words...

35:17.390 --> 35:19.058
a few last words.

35:20.310 --> 35:21.978
Same old Franklin.

35:22.604 --> 35:26.482
Still working those grubby little jobs,
and still messing up.

35:27.984 --> 35:31.112
I always knew you'd end up
in a place like this.

35:31.654 --> 35:34.824
You never cared what you took
or who you hurt.

35:36.200 --> 35:39.495
What about you, Del?
You like living in those dives?

35:39.620 --> 35:42.957
Driving those beat-up old cars?
You like being alone?

35:43.499 --> 35:48.421
You like being broke, and too scared
to use the one thing you got that's special.

35:50.006 --> 35:51.966
I want him killed. Now.

35:52.175 --> 35:55.178
What's the hurry?
Maybe he can be of some use to us.

35:55.261 --> 35:58.180
You don't need him. You've got me.
He's nothing. He's a klutz.

35:58.264 --> 36:00.141
What are you afraid of?

36:00.266 --> 36:03.352
Someone's going to take away
this empty little kingdom of yours?

36:03.436 --> 36:06.439
You want him dead so bad,
do the job yourself.

36:06.897 --> 36:10.026
I leave the menial labor to you, Lance.

36:11.152 --> 36:13.863
I'll be back tonight
and I expect him to be disposed of.

36:13.946 --> 36:15.823
Just a minute, Moreno!

36:15.990 --> 36:18.701
Since when do you give the orders here?

36:18.868 --> 36:20.453
Since now, lady.

36:21.036 --> 36:23.247
And you'd better get used to it.

36:30.296 --> 36:32.548
I want Nick eliminated today.

36:32.798 --> 36:35.384
Every minute that he lives,
we're in danger.

36:35.467 --> 36:38.804
Take Mr. Franklin downstairs.
Give him suitable accommodations.

36:38.887 --> 36:42.975
Treat him like one of the family.
Which is what he's going to be.

36:49.064 --> 36:51.316
The guards at the safe house
don't remember a thing.

36:51.400 --> 36:53.652
Nick must've gotten to them, too.

36:53.736 --> 36:56.572
About all we can do is report Del missing.

36:57.281 --> 36:59.491
I'll bet anything that he's at the Styx.

36:59.575 --> 37:03.162
We send the police over there,
and Del's likely to wind up dead.

37:03.579 --> 37:07.749
- Looks like I got a big night ahead of me.
- You're going undercover?

37:08.208 --> 37:09.877
I'm going dancing.

37:37.487 --> 37:39.114
Hello, Lance boy!

37:47.414 --> 37:49.374
I Want Nick eliminated today.

37:49.499 --> 37:52.210
Every minute that he's alive,
We're in danger.

37:53.795 --> 37:57.007
Take Mr. Franklin doWnstairs.
Give him suitable accommodations.

37:57.090 --> 38:01.052
Treat him like one of the family.
Which is What he's going to be.

38:04.639 --> 38:06.766
You lousy little punk, you.

38:08.101 --> 38:12.230
I could take so much out of your mind you
wouldn't know what to do with a pacifier...

38:12.313 --> 38:13.690
let alone a gun.

38:20.488 --> 38:22.949
What's three plus two, Lance boy?

38:46.848 --> 38:49.976
- Hey, you're quite a number.
- Yes. Unlisted.

38:50.810 --> 38:52.854
I like that. Want to dance?

38:54.147 --> 38:56.149
That's what I'm here for.

39:33.936 --> 39:35.145
Dinner.

39:53.664 --> 39:54.790
I can't.

39:57.126 --> 39:58.961
I just can't.

41:33.304 --> 41:34.514
May I?

41:47.193 --> 41:50.530
- What's the matter? What're you afraid of?
- Nothing.

41:51.531 --> 41:54.951
The way you shrink from my touch,
you'd think I was going to hurt you.

41:55.034 --> 41:57.495
I couldn't hurt you, could I, Angie?

41:57.954 --> 42:00.903
Maybe I'll just wipe out
a year of your life?

42:00.938 --> 42:02.683
Leave you stranded in time?

42:02.917 --> 42:04.627
I'm tired, Nick. I want-

42:04.710 --> 42:07.547
Maybe I'll take you back to a quieter time.

42:07.630 --> 42:10.258
Adolescence, infancy, childhood.

42:11.759 --> 42:15.721
I'll make a nice, calm, quiet little
2- year-old girl out of you, Angie.

42:15.805 --> 42:17.723
No worries. No fears.

42:17.807 --> 42:21.978
- That's almost what happened to Lance.
- Don't hurt me, Nick, please.

42:22.228 --> 42:26.232
You should've thought of that, baby,
before you tried to have me killed.

42:48.879 --> 42:49.964
Del!

42:50.047 --> 42:51.340
Wonder Woman!

42:51.423 --> 42:54.510
We've got to stop
meeting like this. Come on.

43:10.567 --> 43:12.486
I'll take care of him.

43:13.612 --> 43:16.657
- Going somewhere, Nick?
- Stay away from me, you little creep!

43:16.740 --> 43:20.160
I scare you, don't I?
That's what they said at the Institute.

43:20.244 --> 43:21.662
Get lost, man.

43:22.162 --> 43:25.916
That if we ever used our power over
each other, we'd cancel each other out.

43:25.999 --> 43:28.335
You're scared that I can take away
the one thing...

43:28.418 --> 43:30.420
that makes you the big man.

43:30.504 --> 43:34.257
Just leave me alone. I won't do anything
to hurt anybody, I swear.

43:34.341 --> 43:37.719
I've felt like a freak
for as long as I can remember.

43:38.095 --> 43:42.140
You think I'm going to blow the one
chance I've got to become human?

43:42.849 --> 43:44.309
You're nuts.

43:51.858 --> 43:54.361
- I'll take care of her.
- Put that away. You can't use that here.

43:54.444 --> 43:56.863
What do you want me to do,
throw records at her?

43:56.947 --> 44:00.617
I don't care if you have to drown her
in club soda, just get her!

44:10.168 --> 44:12.337
Hey, baby, you're good.
You want to boogie?

44:12.420 --> 44:15.340
- Not right now, thanks.
- I'm not into negative emotions.

44:15.423 --> 44:19.719
- I don't recognize the word "no. "
- Maybe it's time you started.

44:33.525 --> 44:35.151
Leaving so soon?

44:42.700 --> 44:46.913
Here, now. You stay. Somebody will be by
to take your order.

45:17.944 --> 45:20.279
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

45:21.489 --> 45:24.700
I think for the first time in my life,
I'm fine.

45:24.992 --> 45:28.037
And so is he, except I just don't think
he realizes it yet.

45:28.120 --> 45:30.831
- Well, I think someone, probably-
- Hey, baby!

45:30.998 --> 45:34.418
I've been disco-hopping for years.
I've never seen anything like you.

45:34.502 --> 45:37.379
I got this great little place
over in Woodburn...

45:37.963 --> 45:42.551
Well, it appears that the effects of
your psychic powers are only temporary.

45:43.135 --> 45:46.555
Seems that Borden and the others
are slowly regaining the memories...

45:46.639 --> 45:49.433
- that were taken from them.
- My ex-psychic powers.

45:49.517 --> 45:51.852
Me and Nick are now normal people.

45:51.936 --> 45:54.605
Nick took it kind of hard.
It must be quite a shock...

45:54.688 --> 45:57.816
learning to live without a talent
you've depended on all your life.

45:57.900 --> 45:59.902
It is, but now that it's over...

45:59.985 --> 46:02.821
I can see that my power
was never part of my problem.

46:02.905 --> 46:05.532
It was more of a convenient excuse.

46:05.949 --> 46:07.493
What do you mean?

46:07.576 --> 46:10.037
I never really liked myself much before.

46:11.830 --> 46:16.001
When I was trying to get away
from Norman, and I had to choose...

46:17.336 --> 46:21.131
between being like Nick,
just for that moment, or being me...

46:21.381 --> 46:22.758
I chose me.

46:24.384 --> 46:27.721
Del, I think you made an excellent choice.

46:30.515 --> 46:33.810
- It's all right, Diana, really.
- I'm sorry, it was silly of me.

46:33.894 --> 46:37.731
So whatever deep, dark secret of yours
I picked up from before...

46:37.856 --> 46:39.983
is safe. Forever.

46:41.652 --> 46:45.238
You probably would have been
disappointed anyway.
