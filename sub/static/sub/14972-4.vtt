00:00.167 --> 00:04.336
Previously on Van Helsing...

00:04.338 --> 00:05.237
Nikolai...

00:05.239 --> 00:06.672
Recognize me!

00:07.742 --> 00:09.508
Flesh is human.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.510
Says she turned him.

00:11.512 --> 00:14.646
Send word to Dmitri now!

00:14.648 --> 00:16.548
He needs to hear this.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.717
I don't want to be anyone's
answer to anything.

00:18.719 --> 00:20.185
I got my own shit
to take care of.

00:20.187 --> 00:23.655
And I don't need you pushing me
at these people as some saviour.

00:23.657 --> 00:24.757
You are not seriously thinking
on ditching on me.

00:24.759 --> 00:26.558
I have to find Dylan.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.660
You aren't going to do her any
good if you are dead.

00:28.662 --> 00:32.097
She might of made it,
I mean I did, right?

00:32.099 --> 00:32.564
Bite me!

00:32.566 --> 00:34.733
( snarling )

00:37.204 --> 00:38.270
( screaming )

00:39.473 --> 00:41.440
( coughing )

00:41.442 --> 00:43.675
( sighs )

01:38.732 --> 01:45.204
( moaning )

01:51.312 --> 02:00.152
( moaning continues )

02:24.378 --> 02:27.746
I've never...

02:32.186 --> 02:33.469
I mean, this is the first time
I've been with a...

02:33.470 --> 02:34.753
Was it good?

02:42.696 --> 02:47.466
I can still serve you.

02:47.468 --> 02:49.301
Please?

02:56.310 --> 02:58.911
Just tell me what you want.

03:05.519 --> 03:09.821
( piercing shriek )

03:09.823 --> 03:14.560
( growling )

03:18.799 --> 03:22.401
( gasping )

03:31.645 --> 03:32.711
( hissing )

04:16.023 --> 04:26.265
( sobbing )

04:26.267 --> 04:34.740
( sobbing )

04:58.032 --> 05:01.500
You ok?

05:01.502 --> 05:02.601
Never was.

05:02.603 --> 05:06.305
Never will be.

05:06.307 --> 05:07.773
I didn't ask for this.

05:07.775 --> 05:09.341
Neither did I.

05:17.851 --> 05:20.018
I wish I could tell you
it gets easier.

05:23.957 --> 05:27.859
It might be um...

05:27.861 --> 05:29.761
it might be cold comfort,

05:29.763 --> 05:30.929
but at least you were spared.

05:34.335 --> 05:36.868
Spared?

05:36.870 --> 05:39.838
How?

05:39.840 --> 05:42.007
From tearing into someone.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.710
Watching the life drain
out of them.

05:44.712 --> 05:46.445
I was in a cage.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.747
For months.

05:48.749 --> 05:52.484
Alone, hungry.

05:52.486 --> 05:53.418
I know.

05:53.420 --> 05:55.053
Craving something
I could never have.

05:55.055 --> 05:59.124
I know, but you were here,
you were safe, you were fed.

05:59.126 --> 06:01.793
I...

06:01.795 --> 06:03.095
out there...

06:12.639 --> 06:14.139
Julius,

06:16.377 --> 06:17.876
he likes to kill people slowly.

06:17.878 --> 06:23.014
He wants to see the...
terror in their eyes.

06:23.016 --> 06:25.751
He wants them...

06:25.753 --> 06:27.753
he wants them to beg,
and that...

06:27.755 --> 06:30.956
that's what I became, too.

06:30.958 --> 06:34.025
Who's Julius?

06:34.027 --> 06:35.927
Is he the one trying to get
in here?

06:41.802 --> 06:43.802
He's not even the worst
of them.

06:43.804 --> 06:46.738
There's others.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.573
Ancient-

06:52.045 --> 06:59.084
They're brutal.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.887
You were lucky.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.488
Lucky?

07:11.165 --> 07:13.832
I just want to rest.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.038
I hope you can.

07:38.492 --> 07:43.562
( snoring )

07:53.240 --> 07:57.175
( exhales )

08:46.260 --> 08:52.797
( begins screaming )

09:02.109 --> 09:03.909
What happened?

09:03.911 --> 09:06.778
Ask him, he's the one
who found her.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.780
Jesus Christ.

09:28.201 --> 09:30.235
Why now?

09:30.237 --> 09:32.070
Like that?

09:32.072 --> 09:34.072
She was fragile.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.641
Something snapped.

09:36.643 --> 09:38.243
No.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.779
No, I told her we were safe.

09:40.781 --> 09:41.279
She killed herself, Nicole.

09:41.281 --> 09:44.783
You can't wish that away.

09:44.785 --> 09:45.984
Can you blame her?

09:45.986 --> 09:50.789
Living another day like this,
waiting to get killed?

09:53.961 --> 09:54.960
Turned into one of them.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.328
Whatever it was I'm no different
than you now.

09:56.330 --> 09:57.228
Than any of you.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.331
You keep telling yourself
that, Flesh.

09:59.333 --> 09:59.965
Hey, man.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.866
This shit's not working.

10:01.868 --> 10:03.802
We need to stick together.

10:03.804 --> 10:04.936
Keep each other
from falling apart.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.205
Hey, that's ok for you but
who do the rest of us count on?

10:07.207 --> 10:10.241
Relapsed vampires?

10:13.313 --> 10:15.063
The asshole that killed
my wife?

10:15.064 --> 10:16.814
You see what's happening.

10:16.817 --> 10:17.315
They're scared, I get that.

10:17.317 --> 10:18.984
They're rats in a cage.

10:18.986 --> 10:21.653
It's only a matter of time
before they turn on each other.

10:21.655 --> 10:23.254
Or you.

10:23.256 --> 10:25.323
I need to get out of here.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.325
Maybe we all do.

10:27.327 --> 10:30.061
Nobody's going anywhere,
especially not you.

10:30.063 --> 10:30.662
Axel-

10:30.664 --> 10:32.163
End of discussion.

10:54.388 --> 10:56.121
Yeah?

10:56.123 --> 10:59.658
Gonna wear the dead girl's
shoes?

10:59.660 --> 11:02.761
Well, unless the feeders
have re-opened JC Penny...

11:02.763 --> 11:03.962
I'm just being practical.

11:03.964 --> 11:07.132
You are going to throw her down
the chute, right?

11:10.003 --> 11:14.305
She deserves a proper funeral,
wish I could give it to her.

11:14.307 --> 11:17.375
I never took you
as that type.

11:17.377 --> 11:17.942
What, religious?

11:17.944 --> 11:21.846
Sentimental.

11:21.848 --> 11:24.949
Why, 'cause I'm a marine?

11:24.951 --> 11:27.852
I got a conscience.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.988
Pretty sure you got one,
too.

11:29.990 --> 11:33.692
Yeah, well you don't really
know me.

11:33.694 --> 11:36.227
For a long time now you're
the only thing I have known.

11:36.229 --> 11:38.830
You and Vanessa
and this place.

11:38.832 --> 11:39.898
You've known me
as one of them.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.299
No, no, no.

11:41.301 --> 11:44.803
For two and a half years
I knew you as a woman.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.338
The one that got herself bit
trying to save Smitty.

11:47.340 --> 11:52.711
You've been imagining
a me that's not real.

11:52.713 --> 11:55.847
Look, Doc, I kept you alive
because-

11:55.849 --> 11:57.916
Because what?

11:57.918 --> 12:02.821
Because I thought maybe
between you and her and...

12:02.823 --> 12:05.223
we could figure this thing out.

12:08.729 --> 12:12.163
Let me help.

12:12.165 --> 12:15.934
Well, unless you're gonna
help now...

13:23.904 --> 13:27.872
The volcanic ash is decreasing.

13:27.874 --> 13:31.142
This noon curfew is proof.

13:31.144 --> 13:34.145
The sun's becoming a threat
to them again.

13:34.147 --> 13:37.415
Two shifts of our people
work the power plant now.

13:37.417 --> 13:40.985
They're forcing us to make
more cloud cover.

13:40.987 --> 13:43.254
Desperate measures.

13:43.256 --> 13:44.856
It means they're running out
of options.

13:44.858 --> 13:45.957
They'll come up
with new ones.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.992
They won't be forced back
into the shadows.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.527
Yeah, but if we hit that
plant hard enough

13:49.529 --> 13:50.673
it'll take their cover away for-

13:50.674 --> 13:51.818
It's too great a risk.

13:51.819 --> 13:52.963
No, listen to me!

13:52.966 --> 13:54.599
We have to try.

13:54.601 --> 13:57.235
They could do a lot worse
to us than harvest blood.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.069
Oh, ok.

13:58.071 --> 14:00.905
So we go on
working as slaves?

14:00.907 --> 14:04.375
Is that... you wanna get
drained week after week?

14:04.377 --> 14:06.144
Is that what you want?

14:12.919 --> 14:16.154
You know, I remember
when people lived free.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.458
They fought for liberty.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.493
They fought for justice.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.633
Our ancestors spilled
their blood

14:28.635 --> 14:30.101
to throw out their oppressors

14:30.103 --> 14:33.404
and to carve out
a better future.

14:37.577 --> 14:45.383
We need to do the same thing.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.584
I don't know about the rest
of you,

14:46.586 --> 14:49.420
but I'd rather die a patriot
than live another day like this.

14:55.028 --> 14:57.495
Who's with me?

15:05.672 --> 15:07.906
Don't wrap yourself
in a flag yet.

15:07.908 --> 15:09.674
We don't have enough weapons.

15:09.676 --> 15:11.676
Fifth National Bank
on Flanders.

15:11.678 --> 15:12.443
It's heavily guarded.

15:12.445 --> 15:13.970
It's where they've locked up-

15:13.971 --> 15:15.496
You'd never make it-
all the guns-

15:15.497 --> 15:17.022
past the front steps.

15:17.023 --> 15:18.548
We'll cause a diversion.

15:18.551 --> 15:19.517
Quaid.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.386
You wanna lead a suicide
mission, Campbell?

15:21.388 --> 15:24.122
That's your choice.

15:24.124 --> 15:27.125
But I'm out.

15:52.385 --> 15:56.020
Don't give up yet.

15:56.022 --> 15:58.589
She's right, Sheema.

16:02.595 --> 16:08.099
I can't ask them to die
for nothing.

16:08.101 --> 16:12.003
What if there was another
way to get into the building?

16:15.342 --> 16:17.642
I can't believe I missed it.

16:17.644 --> 16:18.710
Jesus.

16:18.712 --> 16:21.980
Somebody took it
after she was already dead.

16:21.982 --> 16:23.114
And that's not all.

16:23.116 --> 16:25.116
The ligature marks.

16:25.118 --> 16:29.287
The rope left friction burns
on her neck, not bruising.

16:29.289 --> 16:32.223
These didn't happen
because of the hanging.

16:32.225 --> 16:32.991
They-

16:32.993 --> 16:36.627
She was strangled.

16:36.629 --> 16:39.230
Somebody in here killed her.

16:39.232 --> 16:42.266
Put her in a noose and
dropped her over the edge.

16:42.268 --> 16:44.235
The finger?

16:44.237 --> 16:45.636
I...

16:45.638 --> 16:48.039
maybe a souvenir.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.499
I make my own food.

17:48.501 --> 17:50.768
I don't wanna be poisoned
by you.

17:55.608 --> 17:59.210
It's like chicken noodle without
the chicken or the noodle.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.853
( alarm sounds )

18:08.855 --> 18:09.387
Feeders.

18:09.389 --> 18:11.689
Nope, fire.

18:11.691 --> 18:19.831
( alarm continues )

18:19.833 --> 18:21.466
What about the sprinklers?

18:21.468 --> 18:22.100
No water pressure.

18:22.102 --> 18:22.834
This is all we got.

18:30.677 --> 18:39.851
( inputting wrong door code )

18:39.853 --> 18:41.586
Nice decoy.

18:41.588 --> 18:42.220
Why are you here?

18:42.222 --> 18:43.405
Same reason as you.

18:43.406 --> 18:44.589
I got plans out there.

18:44.591 --> 18:45.256
Sorry, they don't
involve me.

18:45.258 --> 18:46.691
Yeah, but they could.

18:48.895 --> 18:51.395
( coughing )

18:58.671 --> 19:00.171
( alarm continues )

19:00.172 --> 19:01.672
It was deliberately set.

19:01.674 --> 19:04.175
Why?

19:04.177 --> 19:05.877
To lure us all here.

19:06.813 --> 19:09.147
Vanessa.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.351
Look, I like you, kid.

19:13.353 --> 19:14.552
But I can't.

19:14.554 --> 19:15.753
You want to find
your daughter,

19:15.755 --> 19:16.821
I want to find my sister,
Sheema.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.290
So I thought maybe if we
worked together, maybe-

19:19.292 --> 19:19.924
No.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.292
You're only gonna slow me
down.

19:21.294 --> 19:22.827
Yeah, I know the streets
better than anybody else.

19:22.829 --> 19:23.928
I was a bus driver, kid.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.396
Pretty sure I got the map
in my head.

19:25.398 --> 19:26.664
Yeah, of that Seattle,

19:26.666 --> 19:27.431
not this one.

19:30.470 --> 19:31.502
( inputting wrong door code )

19:31.504 --> 19:33.404
Crap, he changed the codes.

19:33.406 --> 19:35.273
How often do vampires patrol
these streets?

19:35.275 --> 19:37.175
Where do they set up
their traps?

19:37.177 --> 19:38.576
Where's the only bridge going
out of town?

19:38.578 --> 19:39.210
Ok, ok, ok.

19:39.212 --> 19:39.961
You made your point.

19:39.962 --> 19:40.711
Ok, so do we have a deal?

19:40.713 --> 19:43.281
Not if we can't get
out of here.

19:43.283 --> 19:44.415
Watch and learn.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.551
Axel changes the code
all the time.

19:46.553 --> 19:48.319
Keeps it in a notebook
nobody knows about.

19:48.321 --> 19:51.589
But I do.

19:51.591 --> 19:53.691
Aren't you full of surprises?

19:53.693 --> 19:54.425
Damn straight.

19:54.427 --> 19:54.825
Are you ready?

19:54.827 --> 19:55.726
Yes.

20:02.502 --> 20:03.968
Sun's breaking through.

20:03.970 --> 20:06.304
Yeah, that's good for us.

20:06.306 --> 20:08.739
Let's move.

20:35.368 --> 20:37.802
Stupid!

20:47.647 --> 20:49.480
She's long gone by now.

20:49.482 --> 20:50.481
I gotta find her.

20:50.483 --> 20:51.616
No, you don't.

20:51.618 --> 20:55.720
Axel, whatever your mission
was, it's over.

20:55.722 --> 20:57.822
Until I get new orders.

20:57.824 --> 20:58.556
From who?

20:58.558 --> 21:00.691
The marines?

21:00.693 --> 21:03.561
They're all dead.

21:03.563 --> 21:04.662
Look, you walk out there,

21:04.664 --> 21:06.564
maybe we're all dead too
by the time you get back.

21:06.566 --> 21:10.534
Is that what you want?

21:10.536 --> 21:14.338
We need to figure out
who Cynthia's killer is.

21:14.340 --> 21:16.440
I need you here.

21:16.442 --> 21:17.842
Please.

21:46.839 --> 21:49.373
The seeds are beginning
to pop.

22:00.053 --> 22:03.587
I need to talk to you.

22:03.589 --> 22:07.325
About Mohamad.

22:07.327 --> 22:09.327
How well did you know him?

22:15.535 --> 22:17.835
Freakin' fountain
of information.

22:20.340 --> 22:22.773
Hey.

22:22.775 --> 22:25.910
I found this on his bunk.

22:25.912 --> 22:28.479
He tell you he was gonna leave?

22:49.001 --> 22:53.637
At least he said goodbye.

22:53.639 --> 22:56.006
Scared.

22:56.008 --> 22:58.876
Yeah, you and me both.

23:12.558 --> 23:15.993
So this is it, huh?

23:15.995 --> 23:18.028
I could kick it in.

23:18.030 --> 23:18.863
Don't need to.

23:18.865 --> 23:20.798
I put these there for Dylan.

23:20.800 --> 23:24.068
So that no matter what happened
she could always get in safe.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.035
Look, you don't know
what's in there.

23:25.037 --> 23:27.104
It doesn't matter.
I need answers.

23:27.105 --> 23:29.172
It could be the bad kind,
are you ready for that?

24:07.180 --> 24:09.213
Holy.

24:09.215 --> 24:12.683
What happened here?

24:12.685 --> 24:14.585
Shit, is that blood?

24:18.524 --> 24:19.757
Is it your daughter's?

24:19.759 --> 24:23.761
It's mine.

24:23.763 --> 24:26.897
This is where I died.

24:26.899 --> 24:30.701
You do know how bat-shit
crazy that sounds, right?

24:30.703 --> 24:32.069
Yeah.

24:46.819 --> 24:51.555
( coughs )

24:51.557 --> 24:53.891
That was stupid.

25:04.237 --> 25:05.803
( laughs )

25:05.805 --> 25:07.905
Jackpot!

25:07.907 --> 25:10.040
Peaches.

25:10.042 --> 25:11.575
Come to papa.

25:30.563 --> 25:36.700
( starts sobbing )

25:50.249 --> 25:58.789
( sobbing )

26:38.731 --> 26:40.197
That's hilarious.

26:40.199 --> 26:43.734
You saw that shit
in a movie.

26:43.736 --> 26:48.205
Vampires hating garlic,
crosses and turning into bats...

26:48.207 --> 26:51.075
that's just Hollywood bullshit.

26:51.077 --> 26:54.311
Yeah, I guess so.

26:54.313 --> 26:54.912
Oh, god.

26:54.914 --> 26:56.914
Movies.

26:56.916 --> 27:00.784
What's the last one I saw
before it all went bad?

27:00.786 --> 27:03.787
It starred Adam Sandler.

27:03.789 --> 27:08.058
See, now if you want a sign of
the apocalypse coming, I mean...

27:08.060 --> 27:09.793
that's it.

27:19.672 --> 27:23.874
You never did say how
you got that brand.

27:23.876 --> 27:27.244
Oh. They gave it to me.

27:27.246 --> 27:31.081
It's a sign that uh,
I'm just property.

27:36.822 --> 27:38.255
Oh, man.

27:38.257 --> 27:39.823
We gotta book.

27:39.825 --> 27:43.093
It's getting late.

27:43.095 --> 27:45.729
Good peaches, though.

27:58.344 --> 27:59.677
Well...

27:59.679 --> 28:01.345
A nice 12-gauge.

28:01.347 --> 28:02.279
Thanks.

28:02.281 --> 28:06.383
My ex-husband was very
Second Amendment.

28:06.385 --> 28:06.984
Best thing he ever bought me.

28:06.986 --> 28:09.720
Second Amendment.

28:09.722 --> 28:11.155
Remind me, what's that again?

28:22.068 --> 28:26.170
Look.

28:26.172 --> 28:27.905
There.

28:27.907 --> 28:30.941
Those are her footprints.

28:34.213 --> 28:37.247
She was alive after I died.

28:44.023 --> 28:45.989
She made it out.

28:47.393 --> 28:50.027
She made it out.

28:50.029 --> 28:51.161
See?

28:51.163 --> 28:53.731
Never give up.

29:00.239 --> 29:01.205
What?

29:01.207 --> 29:03.006
No, no, no.

29:03.008 --> 29:04.742
We all saw her hanging there.

29:04.744 --> 29:05.743
It was murder.

29:05.745 --> 29:06.877
You don't know that.

29:06.879 --> 29:07.745
Yeah, we do.

29:07.747 --> 29:08.812
Doc examined the body.

29:08.814 --> 29:09.880
Her?

29:09.882 --> 29:10.748
You gotta be kidding me.

29:10.750 --> 29:11.448
Why would I lie?

29:11.450 --> 29:12.816
For all we know,
she killed Cynthia.

29:12.817 --> 29:14.183
You are one paranoid
son of a bitch.

29:14.184 --> 29:15.550
We should have dealt
with you before you turned!

29:15.551 --> 29:16.917
Enough, sit down.

29:16.922 --> 29:19.156
She was strangled,
staged to look like a suicide.

29:19.158 --> 29:22.392
The question is who?

29:29.535 --> 29:30.484
Him.

29:30.485 --> 29:31.434
Flesh.

29:31.437 --> 29:32.302
He- he found her.

29:32.304 --> 29:33.036
I was sleepwalking.

29:33.038 --> 29:36.173
That's where I woke up.

29:36.175 --> 29:38.442
It wasn't me.

29:38.444 --> 29:39.543
We're overlooking
the obvious.

29:39.545 --> 29:41.011
I'm telling you it was that
black kid who conveniently

29:41.012 --> 29:42.478
isn't here anymore.

29:42.481 --> 29:44.081
Oh, so it's either me or
the other black person.

29:44.083 --> 29:45.816
What?

29:45.818 --> 29:46.350
What do you need, a
handwritten confession?

29:46.352 --> 29:47.951
I'm- I never trusted that kid.

29:47.953 --> 29:48.952
Will you get outta my face?!

29:48.954 --> 29:51.355
I don't understand this shit!

29:51.357 --> 29:52.189
Ok?!

29:56.529 --> 29:58.896
Ok, Jesus.

29:58.898 --> 29:59.429
I'm sorry.

29:59.431 --> 30:00.408
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

30:00.409 --> 30:01.386
Hey, hey, hey.

30:01.387 --> 30:02.364
I'm sorry.

30:02.368 --> 30:05.502
Someone get this thing off me!

30:05.504 --> 30:06.503
Jesus.

30:06.505 --> 30:09.373
Maybe it was him.

30:09.375 --> 30:13.977
We can't just...
pin it on Mohamad.

30:13.979 --> 30:16.580
It could be any one of us
in this room.

30:16.582 --> 30:19.249
Anyone.

30:29.295 --> 30:31.161
We had a deal.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.496
I help you look for your kid,
you help me.

30:32.498 --> 30:33.297
My sister?

30:33.299 --> 30:34.198
The cops came to my place.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.900
I have to check
the police station.

30:36.902 --> 30:37.901
You owe me.

30:37.903 --> 30:40.037
I owe it to her not to give up.

30:40.039 --> 30:41.438
Your words.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.841
I can't leave town
until I have answers.

30:43.843 --> 30:45.509
( screaming )

30:45.511 --> 30:48.078
( vampires snarling )

30:54.253 --> 30:55.552
Don't do it.

30:55.554 --> 30:57.120
More will come.

30:57.122 --> 30:59.156
( exhales )

30:59.158 --> 31:01.191
Let them.

31:11.370 --> 31:12.369
( vampires growling )

31:14.440 --> 31:16.974
( gun shot )

31:18.577 --> 31:19.977
( gun shot )

31:25.050 --> 31:26.984
Is everyone okay?

31:29.121 --> 31:31.121
It's bad.

31:31.123 --> 31:32.890
What do we do, Brendan?

31:32.892 --> 31:33.991
I've gotta get my people
some place safe.

31:33.993 --> 31:35.959
Can you help?

31:35.961 --> 31:36.960
We've already done enough.

31:36.962 --> 31:39.529
We have to go.

31:40.966 --> 31:44.635
( sobbing )

31:44.637 --> 31:46.169
Vanessa!

31:53.579 --> 31:54.945
What's your name, sweetie?

31:54.947 --> 31:58.215
Callie.

31:58.217 --> 32:00.517
Don't leave me.

32:00.519 --> 32:02.252
Please.

32:02.254 --> 32:03.520
It's gonna be ok.

32:03.522 --> 32:05.489
I promise.

32:09.194 --> 32:11.261
There's a hospital
not far from here.

32:11.263 --> 32:13.563
We'll take you.

32:26.645 --> 32:37.387
( snarling and growling )

32:44.330 --> 32:50.300
The woman... she's near.

32:50.302 --> 32:53.403
Where?

32:53.405 --> 32:55.639
The bridge.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.274
She killed two ferals.

33:00.746 --> 33:02.279
And now?

33:02.281 --> 33:06.316
Leading a group of humans
on the run.

33:20.199 --> 33:22.532
Kill them, capture her.

33:27.172 --> 33:30.374
She... is strong.

33:38.317 --> 33:43.520
You fear her more than me.

33:57.569 --> 34:01.438
Doing as you are told.

34:01.440 --> 34:06.410
There is a price if I resist.

34:06.412 --> 34:11.281
A bigger price if you do not.

34:15.320 --> 34:19.289
Keep her.

34:19.291 --> 34:24.594
Use her.

34:24.596 --> 34:28.765
Regain your place.

34:49.488 --> 34:52.756
( praying )

34:56.095 --> 35:02.099
Sweetheart, better up to heaven
than another day in this hell.

35:23.655 --> 35:25.689
Come on, let's go.

35:34.800 --> 35:38.435
I guess that leaves
the two of us.

35:38.437 --> 35:42.639
I promise, I'm no threat.

35:42.641 --> 35:45.709
We can trust each other,
right?

35:45.711 --> 35:48.345
Trust?

35:55.921 --> 35:58.822
Good.

35:58.824 --> 36:01.458
Very good.

36:16.208 --> 36:18.642
We made our way from Idaho.

36:18.644 --> 36:21.511
Thought it'd be safer
to the west.

36:21.513 --> 36:26.183
We started out a group of 50
and this is all that's left.

36:26.185 --> 36:26.883
Why here?

36:26.885 --> 36:28.185
Seattle?

36:28.187 --> 36:28.852
Boats.

36:28.854 --> 36:31.922
Rumors of safe havens down
the coast.

36:31.924 --> 36:34.257
There's a way out of this
nightmare, I know there is.

36:34.259 --> 36:37.227
<i> ( feeders calling out )</i>

36:39.498 --> 36:40.030
They're signaling one another.

36:40.031 --> 36:40.563
They're trying to box us in.

36:40.566 --> 36:42.432
Feeders are smart that way.

36:42.434 --> 36:43.833
Way worse than ferals.

36:43.835 --> 36:45.502
We'll never make it
if we stick together.

36:45.504 --> 36:46.503
I'll hold them here.

36:46.505 --> 36:47.771
You get them back safely.

36:47.773 --> 36:48.838
No, no, no.

36:48.840 --> 36:49.439
We're not splitting up.

36:49.441 --> 36:51.741
It's me they want.

36:51.743 --> 36:52.742
I'll stay with you.

36:52.744 --> 36:54.244
No.

36:54.246 --> 36:57.647
Save your people.

36:57.649 --> 36:59.716
Do this, please?

36:59.718 --> 37:00.750
No.

37:00.752 --> 37:02.602
No.

37:02.603 --> 37:04.453
Take care of that little girl.

37:16.335 --> 37:18.401
<i> ( feeders calling out )</i>

37:30.515 --> 37:31.681
I got them from
the lost and found.

37:31.683 --> 37:33.583
It's not exactly
my prescription,

37:33.585 --> 37:36.820
but it's better than nothing.

37:36.822 --> 37:41.725
The last few years my
vision's been 20/20 again.

37:55.674 --> 37:58.608
You're wondering what it was
like, being one of them.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.717
It happened so fast.

38:07.719 --> 38:12.422
Everything that makes
you human, it...

38:12.424 --> 38:18.828
just disappears and in it's
place a... hunger,

38:18.830 --> 38:21.698
all-consuming.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.533
And then the changes.

38:23.535 --> 38:23.933
The strength.

38:23.935 --> 38:25.735
The skin-thinning.

38:25.737 --> 38:28.338
Then all your senses heighten.

38:28.340 --> 38:33.977
Sight, smell, taste.

38:36.448 --> 38:42.052
Yeah. Hearing, too.

38:43.655 --> 38:45.555
Old injuries heal.

38:45.556 --> 38:47.456
I had a bad shoulder.

38:47.459 --> 38:50.660
I can feel it again now.

38:50.662 --> 38:52.662
It's good.

38:52.664 --> 38:55.965
It reminds me of who I am,
what I am.

39:04.943 --> 39:06.743
Do I miss it?

39:21.526 --> 39:24.627
( hissing )

39:33.405 --> 39:36.506
You want me?

39:36.508 --> 39:38.541
Here I am.

39:46.017 --> 39:51.821
( snarling )

39:51.823 --> 39:55.492
( hissing )

39:55.494 --> 40:00.463
Do not fear.

40:00.465 --> 40:01.631
Take her!

40:01.633 --> 40:09.172
( gun shots )

40:21.787 --> 40:25.021
( growling )

40:25.023 --> 40:26.556
Don't kill.

40:26.558 --> 40:27.757
Hold her down.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.092
Hold her!

40:29.094 --> 40:32.462
( screams )

40:39.738 --> 40:40.637
Move. Move it!

40:40.639 --> 40:42.005
Let's go, let's go!

40:52.818 --> 40:53.683
Hurry!

40:53.685 --> 40:55.852
Calm down, I got this.

40:56.188 --> 40:58.855
Go, go, go, go.

41:04.095 --> 41:05.695
Get up the stairs.

41:05.697 --> 41:07.897
Somebody, we need a doctor!

41:18.243 --> 41:20.009
You.

41:20.011 --> 41:20.777
You let them in here?

41:20.779 --> 41:22.779
I didn't have any other choice.

41:22.781 --> 41:23.780
Deal with it, Axel.

41:23.782 --> 41:25.148
You should have left them
out there.

41:25.149 --> 41:26.515
Yeah, instead we left her.

41:26.518 --> 41:28.685
Wait a second.

41:28.687 --> 41:29.219
You were with Vanessa
just now?

41:34.226 --> 41:36.109
Yeah.
