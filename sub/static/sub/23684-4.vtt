WEBVTT

00:03.241 --> 00:04.344
- Previously on
"Hit the Floor"...

00:04.413 --> 00:05.896
- I'm Olivia
and Chase's daughter.

00:05.965 --> 00:07.827
- Before I knew what was
happening, it was over.

00:07.896 --> 00:09.758
- It's a good face.

00:09.827 --> 00:11.931
The Devils are nothing

00:12.000 --> 00:13.448
without Derek Roman.

00:13.517 --> 00:16.068
I'm gonna make it impossible
for them to keep him.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.551
- I heard about your endowment.

00:20.620 --> 00:22.517
Let's just say mine will match.

00:25.448 --> 00:27.482
- I need someone
to have my back on the court.

00:27.551 --> 00:29.137
Play the game or get out of it.

00:29.206 --> 00:30.862
- I can't keep
letting him down.

00:30.931 --> 00:32.724
Help me.
- I'll do it.

00:32.793 --> 00:33.896
I will transform you.

00:33.965 --> 00:35.137
- I wouldn't mind

00:35.206 --> 00:37.586
you not dating anyone else.

00:37.655 --> 00:38.793
- Wow.

00:38.862 --> 00:39.965
You really are a mess.

00:40.034 --> 00:42.758
Lucky for you, I like messes.

00:42.827 --> 00:45.137
- You have to grab
opportunities when you can,

00:45.206 --> 00:47.206
Derek Roman.

00:49.103 --> 00:50.965
- This is all because of you.

00:51.034 --> 00:52.724
I was inspired by you.

01:20.103 --> 01:22.793
- Daddy's home!
It's about time.

01:22.862 --> 01:25.103
- The Roman Emperor returns.

01:25.172 --> 01:26.965
- Three game
suspension was perfect.

01:27.034 --> 01:28.413
My garden is popping!

01:28.482 --> 01:30.275
- Well, Devils Nation
mourned their king.

01:30.344 --> 01:32.724
Good to have you back.

01:33.379 --> 01:34.827
I was gonna call you.

01:34.896 --> 01:35.965
- Me too.

01:36.034 --> 01:37.482
- Derek...

01:37.551 --> 01:39.862
That night...
Us...

01:42.034 --> 01:44.965
I just haven't been able
to stop thinking about it.

01:48.206 --> 01:50.172
I didn't think I could
feel that way again.

01:53.344 --> 01:55.172
And I really think...

01:55.241 --> 01:56.931
We can go the distance.

02:01.310 --> 02:04.103
Full stop! We both know
what that was!

02:04.172 --> 02:05.206
- Hot.

02:05.275 --> 02:07.000
- Yeah, it was hot.

02:07.068 --> 02:09.172
And we get each other.

02:09.241 --> 02:10.689
But you're here to do a job,
and so am I.

02:10.758 --> 02:13.241
So let's not make this
anything else.

02:14.827 --> 02:15.758
Friends?

02:17.034 --> 02:18.689
- Friends.

02:18.758 --> 02:21.275
- Okay.

02:29.448 --> 02:31.551
- 98...
- Whew!

02:31.620 --> 02:33.275
- 99...

02:34.827 --> 02:36.344
- Mm. 100.

02:40.517 --> 02:44.413
We've been at this for hours.

02:44.482 --> 02:45.827
- We're here for you, Pax.

02:45.896 --> 02:47.827
Do you want to be
the next level or not?

02:47.896 --> 02:49.931
- I do...

02:50.000 --> 02:51.172
- I can't hear you!

02:51.241 --> 02:52.896
- I want to be next level.

02:52.965 --> 02:55.000
- Good. Now, drink this.

02:57.586 --> 03:00.034
- Uh...
That looks like swamp water.

03:00.103 --> 03:02.103
- Mm-hmm. Tastes like it too.

03:02.172 --> 03:04.655
Chug-a-lug, buttercup.

03:05.344 --> 03:07.482
No sacrifice is too big, right?

03:07.551 --> 03:11.137
- No sacrifice is too big...

03:11.206 --> 03:12.758
- Good to hear you say that.

03:12.827 --> 03:15.241
I have a list of other things
you'll be sacrificing.

03:15.310 --> 03:17.241
Caffeine, the snooze button,

03:17.310 --> 03:19.586
alcohol, sex, processed sugar--

03:19.655 --> 03:22.137
- Wait, what was that last one?

03:22.206 --> 03:23.310
- Processed sugar.

03:23.379 --> 03:24.896
- No, before that.

03:24.965 --> 03:26.103
- Sex.

03:26.172 --> 03:28.344
- Come again?
- You won't.

03:28.413 --> 03:30.551
Not until you improve
on the court.

03:30.620 --> 03:32.758
Your roamin' tallywhacker got
you here in the first place.

03:32.827 --> 03:35.344
Both Pax and little Pax
are in time-out.

03:35.413 --> 03:38.655
- You might need to be
the one in time-out.

03:38.724 --> 03:41.172
- You want some more
swamp water?

03:41.241 --> 03:43.517
- No, ma'am.
- Drink that now.

03:50.620 --> 03:52.413
- I love that you love hiking.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.344
- No one loves hiking.

03:54.413 --> 03:56.965
I couldn't fit
in my own apartment anymore.

03:57.034 --> 04:00.000
How much stuff
can one person possibly have?

04:00.068 --> 04:03.000
- Says the guy with three boxes
of Playstation games.

04:03.068 --> 04:04.620
- Four.

04:04.689 --> 04:07.275
- Three.

04:07.344 --> 04:10.034
We could move in with Jude.

04:10.103 --> 04:11.896
His place must be huge.

04:11.965 --> 04:14.586
- I haven't seen it yet.

04:14.655 --> 04:17.344
- Wait, you're dating, and
you haven't been to his place?

04:19.620 --> 04:21.344
Where does he live?

04:23.448 --> 04:24.551
What do you know about him?

04:24.620 --> 04:26.586
- He's a private guy.

04:26.655 --> 04:29.137
Our relationship is predicated
on my respecting that.

04:30.448 --> 04:32.586
I have my own life to focus on.

04:32.655 --> 04:34.448
Thanks to coming through
for Lionel

04:34.517 --> 04:36.000
in the poker game
and the brawl,

04:36.068 --> 04:38.172
I nagged seven minutes
on Primetime Sports Hour,

04:38.241 --> 04:40.206
for a topic of my own choosing.

04:40.275 --> 04:41.655
- What's the topic?

04:41.724 --> 04:43.931
- The youngest team owner
in the league,

04:44.000 --> 04:45.206
Jude.

04:45.275 --> 04:47.758
- Nice job respecting
his privacy.

04:47.827 --> 04:49.344
- It's work!

04:49.413 --> 04:52.103
- Next time you highlight
someone on national television,

04:52.172 --> 04:53.379
consider me.

04:53.448 --> 04:54.689
Thanks to the Devils promo

04:54.758 --> 04:56.655
that ISN is airing ad nauseum,

04:56.724 --> 04:59.241
emphasis on the "nauseum,"

04:59.310 --> 05:01.275
London's everywhere.

05:01.344 --> 05:03.034
- You woke the beast.

05:03.103 --> 05:05.241
- No.

05:05.310 --> 05:07.413
She did.

05:13.862 --> 05:15.448
- Hello, Pax.

05:15.517 --> 05:16.965
- Leah...

05:17.034 --> 05:18.206
What are you doing here?

05:18.275 --> 05:19.896
- I'm meeting someone.

05:19.965 --> 05:22.482
But I was hoping
to run into you.

05:22.551 --> 05:24.724
You haven't answered
any of my texts.

05:24.793 --> 05:29.034
- All my attention
is on basketball right now.

05:29.103 --> 05:30.379
- Aww...

05:30.448 --> 05:32.862
Don't you have
just a little attention

05:32.931 --> 05:34.448
left for me?

05:36.068 --> 05:38.206
- The Devil Girls
meant so much to my mother.

05:38.275 --> 05:40.655
Thank you for
taking care of them.

05:40.724 --> 05:41.896
- Taking care of them?

05:41.965 --> 05:43.896
I'm trying to get rich
off of them.

05:43.965 --> 05:46.172
But I can't seem to get
a stake like your mama did.

05:46.241 --> 05:47.689
Olivia Vincent, she knew

05:47.758 --> 05:49.241
how to work an opportunity now.

05:49.310 --> 05:50.655
- You remind me of her.

05:53.724 --> 05:56.241
- Maybe she could've gotten
a cut from Jude. I couldn't.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.344
- Jude's got his own problems.

05:59.413 --> 06:00.586
Thanks to Miami,

06:00.655 --> 06:02.655
the Commissioner's
got his eye on him.

06:02.724 --> 06:03.862
Warren's been out of town,

06:03.931 --> 06:05.517
but I made sure
he got time with him

06:05.586 --> 06:07.137
the minute he was back.

06:07.206 --> 06:08.896
They're in Jude's office now.

06:08.965 --> 06:10.758
- That wasn't Jude's fault.

06:10.827 --> 06:13.034
Things have been koo-koo-town
around here in general.

06:13.103 --> 06:14.482
It's like Devils Arena
was built

06:14.551 --> 06:15.655
on an ancient burial ground

06:15.724 --> 06:17.931
and no one's safe.

06:18.862 --> 06:20.241
Speaking of not being safe,

06:20.310 --> 06:22.068
someone's about to get
their butt kicked.

06:22.137 --> 06:24.137
Excuse me.

06:25.206 --> 06:26.793
Pax, what did
we just talk about?

06:26.862 --> 06:28.137
You've got to stay focused!

06:28.206 --> 06:30.275
- I'm focused...

06:33.724 --> 06:35.862
Look, I'm following
the program.

06:35.931 --> 06:37.482
- Mm-hmm.
- All right, she tried,

06:37.551 --> 06:39.310
and got denied.

06:39.379 --> 06:41.586
I'm in.

06:44.344 --> 06:46.206
- You've inherited a team
plagued with scandal.

06:46.275 --> 06:48.482
- Don't let my last name
fool you, Commissioner.

06:48.551 --> 06:50.137
I didn't inherit anything.

06:50.206 --> 06:51.551
I earned this team.

06:51.620 --> 06:53.275
- One weekend.

06:53.344 --> 06:55.034
Already there's been a brawl,

06:55.103 --> 06:57.310
a concussion,
even a suspension.

06:57.379 --> 06:58.965
- Miami came at us hard.

06:59.034 --> 07:00.689
Now, I assume that
you've had a conversation

07:00.758 --> 07:02.448
with their owner too.

07:02.517 --> 07:04.172
- I assume you're not implying
I don't know how to do my job.

07:04.241 --> 07:06.275
- You're implying
I don't know how to do mine.

07:06.344 --> 07:07.862
- If you did,

07:07.931 --> 07:09.275
you'd choose a different tenor

07:09.344 --> 07:10.724
for this conversation.

07:12.896 --> 07:15.655
- I'm just passionate
about my team.

07:15.724 --> 07:18.172
I don't want any trouble.

07:18.241 --> 07:19.620
- Don't be trouble,

07:19.689 --> 07:21.034
and there won't be any.

07:22.931 --> 07:25.551
I could be your best friend,

07:25.620 --> 07:28.137
or your worst enemy.

07:28.206 --> 07:30.000
Choose wisely.

07:38.689 --> 07:40.103
- How did it go?

07:40.172 --> 07:41.068
- He's been warned.

07:41.137 --> 07:43.482
- What does that mean exactly?

07:43.551 --> 07:44.862
- It means I don't expect
we'll have

07:44.931 --> 07:46.068
more problems with them.

07:46.137 --> 07:47.965
- There was a brawl
on his court

07:48.034 --> 07:49.896
with his starter
throwing fists.

07:49.965 --> 07:51.448
- Derek Roman
sat out three games.

07:51.517 --> 07:52.517
He served his time.

07:52.586 --> 07:54.413
- He burned his house down.

07:54.482 --> 07:55.724
It was full of our people.

07:55.793 --> 07:56.931
Someone could've been hurt,
or--

07:57.000 --> 07:58.827
- That is a non-League issue.

07:58.896 --> 08:00.655
If we have to reprimand
the players

08:00.724 --> 08:01.827
for their personal lives,

08:01.896 --> 08:03.206
we' need a much
bigger department.

08:03.275 --> 08:04.862
- The owner of this team

08:04.931 --> 08:06.413
needs more than a talking to,
Warren.

08:06.482 --> 08:07.517
We need to--

08:07.586 --> 08:10.172
- We don't need to do anything.

08:11.206 --> 08:12.689
Eve, what is this
about for you?

08:15.586 --> 08:17.827
It's clear you have an agenda.

08:17.896 --> 08:21.172
I need someone loyal
to me and mine.

08:21.241 --> 08:22.448
Not their own.

08:24.241 --> 08:25.586
- You ready?

08:25.655 --> 08:26.758
- Eve,

08:26.827 --> 08:29.620
this is my wife, Leah.

08:29.689 --> 08:31.310
- Nice to meet you.

08:31.379 --> 08:32.724
- You too.

08:32.793 --> 08:35.275
- Let's go.
- Yep.

08:50.965 --> 08:52.655
- All right, showers.
Rack them.

08:52.724 --> 08:54.344
Good work, fellas.

08:59.724 --> 09:02.620
- Derek, this has to stop.

09:02.689 --> 09:04.310
- According to who?

09:04.379 --> 09:06.586
You or the Commissioner?

09:06.655 --> 09:08.793
- For the good
of the team, Derek.

09:08.862 --> 09:10.379
Look, we both want
the same thing.

09:10.448 --> 09:12.724
- I don't know what you want.
- A truce.

09:12.793 --> 09:14.000
- That's too bad,

09:14.068 --> 09:16.586
because I don't trust you.

09:31.275 --> 09:34.103
- Pax, hi. Eve.

09:34.172 --> 09:35.862
- Hey.

09:35.931 --> 09:36.965
Do we know each other?

09:37.034 --> 09:38.689
- We have a friend in common.

09:39.379 --> 09:42.103
Commissioner Matthews.
I work him.

09:42.172 --> 09:44.206
- Ah. Um...

09:44.275 --> 09:46.862
I don't know him.
Well, not personally.

09:46.931 --> 09:48.689
- You know his wife.

09:48.758 --> 09:50.931
- I don't think so.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.379
- I saw you with her
this morning.

09:53.448 --> 09:55.034
Leah?

09:55.103 --> 09:57.034
- Leah's married
to the Commissioner?

09:57.103 --> 09:58.724
- You didn't know
she was his wife?

09:58.793 --> 10:01.517
- I didn't know that
she was anyone's wife. I--

10:04.931 --> 10:06.413
- Is something wrong?

10:06.482 --> 10:08.206
- I just uh...

10:09.793 --> 10:11.965
Sorry, look, I gotta get to
practice.

10:12.034 --> 10:14.413
Um, it was nice meeting you.

10:22.793 --> 10:24.586
- Ready for your close-up?

10:24.655 --> 10:26.517
- My what?

10:26.586 --> 10:27.931
- ISN is doing a story on you.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
I'm doing a story on you.

10:31.068 --> 10:32.482
- What'd I do this time?

10:32.551 --> 10:36.241
- Became the youngest team
owner in League history.

10:36.310 --> 10:38.103
It's your origin story.

10:38.172 --> 10:40.448
Lionel thought
it was a great idea.

10:40.517 --> 10:41.793
- Well, Jude disagrees.

10:41.862 --> 10:44.482
- Jude has no choice.

10:44.551 --> 10:46.758
I already started interviewing
people around here.

10:46.827 --> 10:49.827
Most either don't know you
or don't like you.

10:49.896 --> 10:52.068
- Well, I could've
told you that.

10:52.137 --> 10:55.344
Look, Noah, I was a weird kid.

10:55.413 --> 10:56.758
I was always picked last.

10:56.827 --> 10:59.000
I don't give people
warm fuzzies.

10:59.068 --> 11:01.620
I don't need that plastered
across ISN.

11:01.689 --> 11:03.517
- Attention comes with the gig.

11:03.586 --> 11:05.275
Come on, it'll be fun.

11:05.344 --> 11:07.517
- You seem to be
enjoying the idea

11:07.586 --> 11:09.137
of prying into my life.

11:09.206 --> 11:11.482
- Not only am I enjoying it,

11:11.551 --> 11:14.206
I'm getting paid for it.

11:14.275 --> 11:16.896
You're gonna have to open up
eventually, Jude.

11:29.965 --> 11:31.310
- Guess who has the paperwork

11:31.379 --> 11:33.689
that will give you
your star player back.

11:33.758 --> 11:34.931
- Great.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.586
We can put this mess behind us,

11:36.655 --> 11:38.241
and focus on Portland.

11:38.310 --> 11:40.413
- LA owns Portland.

11:40.482 --> 11:42.103
What's to focus on?

11:42.172 --> 11:45.068
- You can't underestimate
any situation.

11:45.137 --> 11:46.379
The minute you let
your guard down

11:46.448 --> 11:48.310
is when you make
the biggest mistakes.

11:48.379 --> 11:50.793
So I'm doing my research,
going over stats,

11:50.862 --> 11:53.068
learning each of their players'
strengths and weaknesses.

11:53.137 --> 11:54.655
- You never know
when that kind of

11:54.724 --> 11:56.689
information comes in handy.

11:56.758 --> 11:58.413
Sometimes winning or losing

11:58.482 --> 11:59.689
isn't about what you know,

11:59.758 --> 12:01.448
but when you use it.

12:01.517 --> 12:03.482
- What's that?
"The Art of War"?

12:03.551 --> 12:06.310
- "Daly Life", the
autobiography of Chuck Daly,

12:06.379 --> 12:08.000
he coached
the Olympic Dream Team.

12:08.068 --> 12:09.896
- I know who Chuck Daly is.

12:09.965 --> 12:11.413
I'm surprised you did.

12:11.482 --> 12:12.793
- Mm.

12:12.862 --> 12:15.551
What was that you said
about underestimating?

12:17.586 --> 12:20.310
- Where do I sign?

12:20.379 --> 12:22.448
- Here.

12:25.758 --> 12:28.000
Here.

12:33.689 --> 12:35.689
And here.

12:39.413 --> 12:41.689
Derek's all yours.

12:48.965 --> 12:50.379
Everything okay?

12:50.448 --> 12:52.689
- No.

12:52.758 --> 12:54.793
Yeah, uh...

12:54.862 --> 12:56.965
I hope so.

12:57.034 --> 12:59.000
Something I have to deal with.

12:59.068 --> 13:00.793
I just don't know how.

13:02.862 --> 13:05.344
- Nothing's impossible, German.

13:05.413 --> 13:07.827
There's always a new play
to be made.

13:18.206 --> 13:19.862
- What are you doing out here?

13:21.896 --> 13:23.413
- Having a meltdown.

13:27.793 --> 13:29.034
- Let's hear it.

13:32.655 --> 13:35.379
- I'm on a track now.

13:35.448 --> 13:37.310
I have a plan,

13:37.379 --> 13:38.827
and I can't afford
to mess that up,

13:38.896 --> 13:41.344
and it's too easy to
around here.

13:43.724 --> 13:46.103
- I gotta be smarter.

13:46.172 --> 13:48.103
I mean, this was our dream

13:48.172 --> 13:49.896
since we were kids.
I--

13:51.620 --> 13:53.827
I can't blow it.

13:53.896 --> 13:55.931
- Who's we?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.172
- Look,
I'm not trying to unload

13:58.241 --> 14:00.310
on anyone here, okay? I just--

14:00.379 --> 14:03.000
- That first day
when you were running in,

14:03.068 --> 14:04.827
you told me you
owed me your life.

14:04.896 --> 14:06.137
I'm collecting.

14:10.620 --> 14:13.103
- Me and my brother...

14:13.172 --> 14:15.448
Marcus...

14:15.517 --> 14:17.689
He was the star of the family.

14:17.758 --> 14:19.448
Better than I ever was, but...

14:22.137 --> 14:23.689
He never got the chance
to play.

14:23.758 --> 14:26.517
- What happened to him?

14:26.586 --> 14:28.137
- Aneurism.

14:32.172 --> 14:33.793
We were fighting over

14:33.862 --> 14:35.172
who had to fix

14:35.241 --> 14:37.172
the garbage disposal
for my mom.

14:38.724 --> 14:40.827
She jammed that thing
at least once a week.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.724
One minute he was
under the sink,

14:47.793 --> 14:49.793
and...

14:55.689 --> 14:58.103
And the next...

14:58.172 --> 14:59.931
He, uh...

15:02.482 --> 15:03.931
- Thank you.

15:06.034 --> 15:07.655
For telling me.

15:11.206 --> 15:13.034
You're deeper than people
give you credit for.

15:13.103 --> 15:16.172
Well, than I give
you credit for.

15:20.758 --> 15:22.482
You're a good guy, Pax.

15:23.896 --> 15:25.482
And if you have
a meltdown again,

15:25.551 --> 15:27.655
just ask me,

15:27.724 --> 15:29.896
and I'll remind you.

15:43.034 --> 15:44.517
- Derek, I have a problem.

15:44.586 --> 15:46.793
- No, you gave up the plaid,
you're good.

15:49.758 --> 15:51.448
What's going on?

15:52.137 --> 15:54.103
- Sometimes I like a little

15:54.172 --> 15:55.310
gambling with my cards.

15:55.379 --> 15:57.137
You know, as an outlet,

15:57.206 --> 15:58.758
something I picked up
in Boston.

15:58.827 --> 16:01.827
And, uh...

16:01.896 --> 16:03.103
I made a bad bet

16:03.172 --> 16:05.172
that's come back to haunt me.

16:05.241 --> 16:06.517
- How much you need?

16:06.586 --> 16:09.448
- I wish it was that easy, man.

16:09.517 --> 16:13.310
Look, now that I've landed
this coaching job...

16:13.379 --> 16:16.241
Paying back the debt
is not an option anymore.

16:16.310 --> 16:17.758
- What do they want then?

16:19.793 --> 16:22.655
- A guaranteed spread
on the next game.

16:22.724 --> 16:23.724
- A guaranteed...

16:23.793 --> 16:26.310
- I know.

16:26.379 --> 16:29.620
But it's Portland, you know,

16:29.689 --> 16:32.620
and we just have to make sure
the spread stays within ten.

16:35.068 --> 16:36.379
The way you
handle the ball, man,

16:36.448 --> 16:38.000
no one will ever know.

16:38.068 --> 16:39.241
- I'd know.

16:42.034 --> 16:43.965
- It's an early season game,

16:44.034 --> 16:46.068
so nothing's riding on it.

16:49.034 --> 16:51.034
I'm so sorry I have to ask.

16:51.103 --> 16:53.586
All right, if I could
get out of this on my own,

16:53.655 --> 16:55.586
I would.

16:57.482 --> 16:59.241
I wouldn't blame you
if you say no.

17:01.206 --> 17:04.482
- I don't know, man.

17:04.551 --> 17:06.206
- Okay.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.793
- So I just wanted to show you

17:15.862 --> 17:17.034
some appreciation for that

17:17.103 --> 17:19.241
spark-tacular promo.

17:22.862 --> 17:24.310
- Are you proposing to me?

17:24.379 --> 17:26.413
- Unruly lace.

17:26.482 --> 17:28.620
Turn around, look up, please.

17:32.206 --> 17:33.758
- Oh, my God.

17:33.827 --> 17:35.793
Damn.

17:35.862 --> 17:38.241
- Iconic.

17:38.310 --> 17:39.655
- Yeah,
Derek loved the promo too.

17:39.724 --> 17:42.793
He thought the sparks
were gonna hurt.

17:42.862 --> 17:44.137
- When was he there?

17:44.206 --> 17:46.379
- After everyone left.

17:48.758 --> 17:51.275
- You and Derek
are having sex!

17:51.344 --> 17:54.206
- Had.
And it was a one-time thing.

17:54.275 --> 17:55.413
We're just friends.

17:55.482 --> 17:57.965
- Missionary
or you on top?

17:58.034 --> 17:59.241
- Both.

17:59.310 --> 18:01.931
- Clothes off or on?

18:02.000 --> 18:03.793
- Some on and some off.

18:03.862 --> 18:04.965
- More than friends.

18:05.034 --> 18:06.000
- How can you tell
based on that?

18:06.068 --> 18:07.413
- I was just interested.

18:07.482 --> 18:08.793
I'm basing it on the fact that

18:08.862 --> 18:10.517
I just showed you this
amazing poster,

18:10.586 --> 18:12.241
and the first thing
you mentioned was Derek.

18:12.310 --> 18:13.827
- Look,

18:13.896 --> 18:15.068
you're crazy.

18:15.137 --> 18:17.689
We're friends, and that's that.

18:25.517 --> 18:27.586
All right, listen up, y'all.

18:27.655 --> 18:29.517
We are about to be do-gooders.

18:29.586 --> 18:31.724
Our next dance
is gonna be for charity.

18:31.793 --> 18:34.517
But that's the only kindness
we're gonna show,

18:34.586 --> 18:36.482
'cause it's an underground
vogue battle,

18:36.551 --> 18:38.379
against each other.

18:38.448 --> 18:40.413
Whoever nets the most dough

18:40.482 --> 18:42.344
gets to death drop
on everyone else's grave.

18:42.413 --> 18:44.068
- Um...

18:44.137 --> 18:46.000
Amazing idea.
- I know.

18:46.068 --> 18:47.344
- Except...

18:47.413 --> 18:49.103
- Except what?

18:49.172 --> 18:52.517
- Well, except why underground?

18:52.586 --> 18:54.827
- That's how vogue battles
work, darling.

18:54.896 --> 18:58.620
- But this is a Kyle Hart
vogue battle.

18:58.689 --> 19:00.172
It should be a media event,

19:00.241 --> 19:01.758
crawling with press.

19:01.827 --> 19:04.034
It's great publicity
for the Devil Girls.

19:04.103 --> 19:05.620
I mean, what good's doing good

19:05.689 --> 19:06.965
if no one's there to see it?

19:09.344 --> 19:10.344
- I'll make some calls.

19:12.724 --> 19:15.379
- Publicity
for the Devil Girls, huh?

19:15.448 --> 19:18.448
Or are you just looking
for publicity for yourself?

19:18.517 --> 19:21.103
- This is my dance.

19:21.172 --> 19:22.620
I'm gonna win.

19:22.689 --> 19:24.068
- So delusional
doesn't just apply

19:24.137 --> 19:25.448
to your fashion sense.

19:25.517 --> 19:27.655
- Vouging is about improv.

19:27.724 --> 19:29.965
You're known
for your choreography.

19:30.034 --> 19:32.517
- You're known
for dancing my choreography.

19:32.586 --> 19:33.931
- I guess we'll just have
to see

19:34.000 --> 19:35.413
who thinks faster
on their feet.

19:35.482 --> 19:37.689
- Yeah, well,
you better hope it's you.

19:37.758 --> 19:38.896
Because if I take this,
that would be

19:38.965 --> 19:41.241
two big-time
back-to-back wins for me.

19:43.793 --> 19:45.379
Good luck, though.

20:01.379 --> 20:02.413
- You look like
you got the weight

20:02.482 --> 20:04.275
of the world
on your shoulders.

20:04.344 --> 20:05.931
- Same.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.517
What's going on?

20:07.586 --> 20:10.103
- I got asked to do a favor
for a friend.

20:10.172 --> 20:12.586
- Doesn't sound so difficult.

20:12.655 --> 20:14.482
- You?

20:14.551 --> 20:16.413
- Vogue battle.

20:16.482 --> 20:18.724
- That doesn't sound
too difficult either.

20:18.793 --> 20:21.379
- I need to win,
and I need to win big.

20:21.448 --> 20:24.344
I convinced Kyle to make it
a media event.

20:24.413 --> 20:26.517
Now, I have to get
everyone there.

20:28.689 --> 20:31.448
It would be huge
if the ballers went.

20:32.344 --> 20:34.862
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.

20:34.931 --> 20:37.586
Look, this is a favor
I'm happy to do.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.413
- Los Angeles
is putting on

20:48.482 --> 20:50.275
a clinic against
Portland tonight!

20:55.000 --> 20:56.724
- Mr. Matthews.

20:56.793 --> 20:58.448
Thanks for accepting my invite.

20:58.517 --> 21:00.413
I know you had
your choice of games today.

21:00.482 --> 21:02.965
- Leah, this is Jude Kinkade,

21:03.034 --> 21:04.448
new owner of the team.

21:04.517 --> 21:06.931
- Oh, nice to meet you.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.551
- Your husband is intimidating
as hell.

21:08.620 --> 21:10.172
- Commissioner,

21:10.241 --> 21:11.413
if you have a minute--

21:11.482 --> 21:13.000
- I don't.

21:13.068 --> 21:14.965
I have everything
under control here, Eve.

21:15.034 --> 21:16.275
We'll talk tomorrow.

21:22.689 --> 21:24.448
- LA's got the ball

21:24.517 --> 21:27.000
and it's a ten-point game.

21:27.068 --> 21:28.965
Pax Lowe,
he has been solid tonight.

21:38.758 --> 21:40.034
- Thank you.

21:40.103 --> 21:41.896
- Look, you're gonna
have to find another outlet,

21:41.965 --> 21:43.413
'cause this will never
happen again.

21:43.482 --> 21:45.379
- I hear you.

21:45.448 --> 21:47.586
Never again.

21:47.655 --> 21:50.896
- Jude Kinkade
was a lonely kid.

21:50.965 --> 21:52.827
Lonely...

21:54.310 --> 21:57.379
Jude Kinkade was a lonely kid.

21:57.448 --> 22:00.379
- All that's missing
is the Sarah McLachlan song.

22:01.551 --> 22:03.034
- I couldn't get the rights.

22:03.103 --> 22:04.482
You want to see
what I've got so far?

22:04.551 --> 22:05.896
- I really don't--

22:05.965 --> 22:07.827
- Jude Kinkade
was a lonely kid.

22:07.896 --> 22:09.896
The son of one of the most
powerful men in basketball

22:09.965 --> 22:11.793
was chucked like a dead ball,

22:11.862 --> 22:14.206
raised by a single mother
in government housing

22:14.275 --> 22:15.827
in South Florida.

22:15.896 --> 22:17.620
Kinkade was driven
by a need for acceptance,

22:17.689 --> 22:19.000
to be a part of something.

22:19.068 --> 22:20.206
And if he wasn't
going to get help,

22:20.275 --> 22:21.344
he'd do it himself.

22:21.413 --> 22:22.758
We're talking to the man

22:22.827 --> 22:24.413
who overcame
incredible obstacles

22:24.482 --> 22:26.206
to become
the youngest team owner

22:26.275 --> 22:28.827
in the history of the sport.

22:30.310 --> 22:32.172
- Some spin.
- It's not spin.

22:32.241 --> 22:35.689
- Well, there's a Noah
punchline in there eventually.

22:35.758 --> 22:38.344
- Jude, this is how I see you.

22:38.413 --> 22:40.931
How I want the world
to see you.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.103
It's how you need
to see yourself.

22:51.241 --> 22:52.965
- Can I have my bill, please?

22:53.034 --> 22:55.068
- Thanks.

22:58.413 --> 23:01.931
Well, hello again.

23:04.275 --> 23:05.896
What are you doing here?

23:07.379 --> 23:09.275
- Trying to stay
out of trouble.

23:09.344 --> 23:11.551
And failing.

23:12.517 --> 23:14.172
- How so?

23:18.103 --> 23:20.034
Do you think I'm trouble?

23:22.103 --> 23:23.551
- Maybe.

23:24.172 --> 23:27.482
- I'd never want to be trouble
for you, German.

23:27.551 --> 23:28.793
Not you.

23:30.724 --> 23:33.137
- It's complicated, Eve.

23:33.206 --> 23:35.586
- It doesn't have to be.

23:36.862 --> 23:39.482
- So why are you here?

23:39.551 --> 23:43.517
- I had to pick
up some receipts

23:43.586 --> 23:44.862
for the Commissioner.

23:44.931 --> 23:47.965
- I thought you might be
staying here.

23:48.034 --> 23:49.965
- I could be.

24:02.517 --> 24:04.931
- I gotta go.

24:13.344 --> 24:14.689
- Everybody grab your seats

24:14.758 --> 24:16.103
for the Vogue Battle!

24:17.482 --> 24:21.241
- Hey, bro, thanks for inviting
me on the party bus.

24:21.310 --> 24:22.586
- It's for the team.

24:22.655 --> 24:24.172
You're part of the team,
aren't you?

24:24.241 --> 24:25.448
- I'm trying.

24:25.517 --> 24:27.655
- Succeeding.

24:27.724 --> 24:30.103
Whatever you're doing
is working.

24:30.172 --> 24:31.448
I give you shit

24:31.517 --> 24:32.965
for all my stats
you throw in my face,

24:33.034 --> 24:35.517
but it's good gas in my tank.

24:35.586 --> 24:38.793
- Are you saying
that you love me?

24:38.862 --> 24:42.344
- I'm saying you're banished
from the party bus.

24:42.413 --> 24:46.379
- Welcome to the Devil Girls'
Vogue Ball, y'all.

24:55.034 --> 24:57.586
- Let the lady
tell you the rules.

24:59.172 --> 25:00.620
Go ahead, mama.

25:00.689 --> 25:01.827
- Thank you.

25:01.896 --> 25:03.862
We are gonna dance for you.

25:03.931 --> 25:05.551
You see these things
right here?

25:05.620 --> 25:07.068
These suckers'll climb

25:07.137 --> 25:09.655
based on your applause
and text donations.

25:09.724 --> 25:11.275
You like somebody?

25:11.344 --> 25:13.206
You make it rain!

25:22.793 --> 25:26.172
- So are you dancing
for charity or Derek?

25:26.241 --> 25:28.517
- I could ask you
the same question,

25:28.586 --> 25:30.862
but I don't have to.

25:31.586 --> 25:33.103
- You're crazy.

25:34.655 --> 25:36.896
- You want him.

25:39.655 --> 25:42.034
- Youwant him.

25:42.103 --> 25:43.862
- Are y'all ready to battle?

25:53.068 --> 25:54.482
- We're gonna start with
a little team performance.

25:54.551 --> 25:56.793
Ladies, play nice.

25:56.862 --> 26:00.620
Hey, hey, hey,
let's go, let's go, let's go.

26:26.103 --> 26:28.931
Oh, bitch,
let the battles begin!

26:29.000 --> 26:30.310
Let's go.

27:46.206 --> 27:48.586
We've got some crowd
taggin' in.

28:08.517 --> 28:10.172
Ooh, let's go!

28:25.620 --> 28:28.724
It's down
to London and Jamie!

28:28.793 --> 28:30.586
Oh, let's go!

29:08.862 --> 29:10.517
Ooh, ladies and gentlemen,
our grand-prize

29:10.586 --> 29:14.551
of the Vogue Ball, Jamie!

29:14.620 --> 29:16.413
Good job,
she did it, she did it.

29:16.482 --> 29:18.068
She took that grand prize.

29:18.137 --> 29:19.965
She took that
grand prize.

29:20.034 --> 29:21.655
She did it, grand prize.

29:21.724 --> 29:25.896
She took that grand prize,
give her a round of applause.

29:25.965 --> 29:28.482
Work, Jamie, work, girl, ow!

29:37.758 --> 29:39.965
- Let's go!

29:40.034 --> 29:42.517
- Derek!

29:42.586 --> 29:43.689
- I'm off duty.

29:43.758 --> 29:45.551
- I'll keep this quick.

29:45.620 --> 29:48.758
You will trust me, because
I'm the owner and you have to.

29:48.827 --> 29:51.344
- Do I know?
- It's my job to earn it.

29:51.413 --> 29:52.758
And I will.

29:52.827 --> 29:54.620
I don't know how,

29:54.689 --> 29:55.931
but I've done a hell
of a lot more

29:56.000 --> 29:57.344
with a hell of a lot less.

29:57.413 --> 29:59.655
And I'll figure this out too.

30:04.448 --> 30:05.517
- It's Lawson.

30:05.586 --> 30:07.482
L-A-W-S-O-N.

30:07.551 --> 30:09.793
Thanks.

30:12.172 --> 30:14.758
- Whatever drama you
and London got going on

30:14.827 --> 30:16.310
really paid off tonight.

30:16.379 --> 30:18.551
- It almost seems
like you planned it this way.

30:18.620 --> 30:20.482
- Didn't it?

30:20.551 --> 30:22.241
- Fine with me, I won.

30:22.310 --> 30:23.896
How bad did I wreck her?

30:23.965 --> 30:25.517
- It was a knockout,

30:25.586 --> 30:26.620
eventually.

30:26.689 --> 30:28.206
- Eventually?

30:28.275 --> 30:30.724
- London was in the lead,
till the last second,

30:30.793 --> 30:32.482
when a $10,000 donation
came your way.

30:32.551 --> 30:34.689
- From who?

30:34.758 --> 30:36.241
- That's the number
right there.

30:41.620 --> 30:42.965
- Hey.

30:43.034 --> 30:44.758
Great job tonight.

30:44.827 --> 30:46.655
- Thanks.

30:46.724 --> 30:49.379
- I appreciate the conversation

30:49.448 --> 30:50.620
we had before.

30:50.689 --> 30:51.896
I was wondering--

30:51.965 --> 30:54.896
- One sec! Sorry.

30:54.965 --> 30:56.000
- Yo, it's Derek.

30:56.068 --> 30:57.827
You know what to do.

31:02.241 --> 31:03.724
- You all right?

31:03.793 --> 31:06.344
- Yeah. Yes. Sorry.

31:08.689 --> 31:10.827
Noah.

31:10.896 --> 31:12.965
You'll never believe
what just happened!

31:26.896 --> 31:28.724
- I didn't want
to order without you.

31:28.793 --> 31:30.517
- Yeah, um...

31:30.586 --> 31:33.172
Eve, I'm not staying.

31:33.241 --> 31:36.103
Look, you're extremely capable.

31:36.172 --> 31:38.896
You are also extremely
strong-willed.

31:39.586 --> 31:42.620
It's clear you have a
personal issue with the Devils

31:42.689 --> 31:44.241
and I can't have that.
I'm sorry.

31:45.448 --> 31:48.482
I need someone I can trust
to have my back.

31:50.137 --> 31:52.862
- You can trust me
to have your back.

31:52.931 --> 31:55.379
The person you can't trust
is at home.

31:56.896 --> 31:59.000
- What are you talking about?

31:59.068 --> 32:01.379
- Your wife cheated on you

32:01.448 --> 32:02.793
with a Devil.

32:02.862 --> 32:04.379
Pax Lowe.

32:04.448 --> 32:07.689
I have the hotel receipts
to prove it.

32:15.827 --> 32:17.413
I'm so sorry.

32:35.965 --> 32:38.034
- That ride is ridiculous.

32:38.103 --> 32:39.793
- What's ridiculous

32:39.862 --> 32:41.620
is you in that ring tonight.

32:41.689 --> 32:43.379
Well done.

32:43.448 --> 32:44.827
- I didn't win.

32:44.896 --> 32:46.758
- A technicality.

32:46.827 --> 32:49.482
- You're biased,
you're my buddy.

32:49.551 --> 32:51.172
- But watching you dance,

32:51.241 --> 32:54.413
buddy wasn't
what I was feeling.

32:54.482 --> 32:55.896
- No?

32:55.965 --> 32:57.827
- You tell me.

32:57.896 --> 33:00.379
You watching me too?

33:02.068 --> 33:04.689
- Would you have won tonight?

33:04.758 --> 33:07.068
What's your moves? Show me.

34:06.793 --> 34:09.931
- Whew! Ooh, child.

34:11.758 --> 34:13.620
- So you have a new member.

34:13.689 --> 34:15.793
- I'm gonna have to get
a couple of ribs removed

34:15.862 --> 34:16.931
for it to fit.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.482
- Aren't you sweet?

34:19.551 --> 34:20.862
Well, I'll pay for the surgery,

34:20.931 --> 34:23.862
because
I made 350 grand tonight.

34:23.931 --> 34:25.793
- Don't you mean the charity

34:25.862 --> 34:27.206
made 350 grand?

34:27.275 --> 34:29.103
- Charity begins at home.

34:32.068 --> 34:34.241
Relax, it's going to charity.

34:34.310 --> 34:36.068
I'll just stay poor.

34:36.137 --> 34:37.724
- Maybe not much longer.

34:39.103 --> 34:40.482
Your program is paying off.

34:40.551 --> 34:43.379
I'm doing way better
on the court.

34:44.793 --> 34:46.758
Derek even
complimented me on it.

34:46.827 --> 34:48.448
- A compliment
from Derek Roman?

34:48.517 --> 34:49.965
Now, that's money in the bank!

34:50.034 --> 34:52.034
Go get us some more hooch,
would you, darling?

34:52.103 --> 34:53.724
This deserves a toast.

34:53.793 --> 34:55.413
- What am I?
The bottle bitch?

34:57.517 --> 34:58.896
- Here's your tip.

34:58.965 --> 35:00.517
- Ponytails!

35:02.931 --> 35:04.275
- I could tell
you were feeling good

35:04.344 --> 35:06.172
when you sashayed up to Jamie.

35:06.241 --> 35:08.068
You were gonna ask her out.

35:08.137 --> 35:09.931
- Maybe.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.275
- Look at you.

35:11.344 --> 35:12.793
Focused,

35:12.862 --> 35:14.931
making moves.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.034
- You said I have potential.

35:17.103 --> 35:20.034
I'm finally feeling it
on and off the court.

35:20.103 --> 35:21.482
- Stick with me.

35:21.551 --> 35:23.275
The best is yet to come.

35:30.448 --> 35:31.965
- Look at us.

35:32.034 --> 35:34.068
Burning the midnight oil.

35:34.862 --> 35:36.862
I have a few follow-up
questions for you.

35:36.931 --> 35:37.965
- Hit me.

35:41.620 --> 35:42.862
- I've got your work stuff.

35:42.931 --> 35:46.275
I just need
a little more...color.

35:46.344 --> 35:49.068
- All work, no play. Sorry.

35:49.137 --> 35:50.896
- Well, not no play.

35:50.965 --> 35:53.344
You were in a pretty public
relationship.

35:54.344 --> 35:56.551
With a Devil.

35:57.379 --> 35:58.758
- It wasn't public.

35:58.827 --> 36:00.862
- You made out
on the jumbotron.

36:02.482 --> 36:04.724
Was that a political statement,
or--

36:04.793 --> 36:06.034
- It wasn't a statement at all.

36:06.103 --> 36:07.931
It just happened.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.206
- Well,

36:09.275 --> 36:10.689
in front of 25,000 people.

36:10.758 --> 36:13.896
Not to mention
millions at home.

36:15.241 --> 36:17.862
You and Zero
were the it couple.

36:18.896 --> 36:20.620
Such a high-profile
relationship,

36:20.689 --> 36:24.241
but such a private break-up.

36:24.310 --> 36:25.931
What happened?

36:28.758 --> 36:31.137
- I'm not ready to do this.

36:33.034 --> 36:34.689
- Okay.

36:34.758 --> 36:38.103
It's late, we can pick this up
tomorrow.

36:38.172 --> 36:39.862
- I mean this...

36:39.931 --> 36:41.241
Us...

36:45.655 --> 36:48.241
- I'm sorry,
I'll stop with the digging.

36:48.310 --> 36:50.413
- It's not that,
it's just I...

36:52.620 --> 36:54.965
I'll call you.

36:59.413 --> 37:02.310
- No, you won't.

37:14.103 --> 37:16.103
Bye, Jude.

37:59.379 --> 38:00.586
- Warren, good to see you.

38:00.655 --> 38:03.517
- Your player, Pax Lowe,
screwed my wife!

38:03.586 --> 38:05.655
I want him gone.

38:05.724 --> 38:07.275
I want him gone!

38:33.965 --> 38:36.379
- German.

39:15.137 --> 39:17.000
- Next on "Hit the Floor"...

39:17.068 --> 39:18.689
- So you have nothing to say
about

39:18.758 --> 39:19.793
your romantic relationship
with Derek Roman?

39:19.862 --> 39:21.103
- My what now?

39:21.172 --> 39:22.862
- The Isnys, the night
the sports world

39:22.931 --> 39:25.137
gathers to celebrate
their greatness.

39:26.758 --> 39:28.034
- Derek, someone could see.

39:28.103 --> 39:29.724
- I drove your Mercedes here.

39:29.793 --> 39:31.620
She rides like a dream.

39:31.689 --> 39:33.655
- I know exactly how
she rides.

39:33.724 --> 39:35.517
Oh, the things we've shared.

39:35.586 --> 39:37.655
- I'll see to it that you never

39:37.724 --> 39:39.310
play professional
basketball again.

39:39.379 --> 39:42.517
- The person who called him and
got him all worked up was you.
