00:14.431 --> 00:16.387
- What?!
- ( Overlapping chatter)

00:17.518 --> 00:19.474
(vocalizing )

00:34.576 --> 00:37.659
That was barely
worth the effort, Adagio.

00:37.913 --> 00:40.905
I'm tired of fast food.
I need a meal.

00:41.166 --> 00:44.329
The energy in this world
isn't the same as in Equestria.

00:44.586 --> 00:47.123
We can only gain
so much power here.

00:47.381 --> 00:50.464
Ugh, I wish we'd never
been banished to this awful place.

00:50.717 --> 00:53.550
Really?
I love it here.

00:53.804 --> 00:57.592
For realsies? Because I think
this place is the worst.

00:57.849 --> 00:59.805
I think you're the worst,
Sonata.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.267
Oh, yeah?
Well, I think you're--

01:02.521 --> 01:05.058
(groans)
I'll tell you one thing--

01:05.315 --> 01:06.805
being stuck here
with you two

01:07.067 --> 01:10.434
isn't making this world
any more bearable.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.297
( gasps )
Did you feel that?

01:34.469 --> 01:36.676
Do you know what that is?

01:36.930 --> 01:38.045
Both: Uh-uh.

01:38.307 --> 01:40.764
It's Equestrian magic.

01:41.018 --> 01:44.101
But this world doesn't
have Equestrian magic.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.560
It does now.

01:45.814 --> 01:48.806
And we're going to use it
to make everyone

01:49.067 --> 01:52.980
in this pathetic
little world adore us.

01:59.161 --> 02:01.117
( music playing )

02:08.044 --> 02:10.457
We used to fight
with each other

02:10.714 --> 02:12.670
Oh, whoa-- whoa-- whoa

02:12.924 --> 02:14.789
That was before
we discovered

02:15.052 --> 02:17.134
Oh, whoa-- whoa-- whoa

02:17.387 --> 02:19.218
Back when your
friendship was real

02:19.473 --> 02:21.259
Oh, whoa-- whoa-- whoa

02:21.516 --> 02:24.474
Yeah, you just say
what you feel

02:24.728 --> 02:26.935
And the music

02:27.189 --> 02:28.804
Yeah, the music

02:29.066 --> 02:31.307
Gets us to the top

02:35.072 --> 02:37.484
As we learn how the rainbow

02:37.741 --> 02:39.777
Rainbow rocks

02:48.543 --> 02:50.659
You can pick up the bass

02:50.921 --> 02:52.661
Oh, whoa-- whoa-- whoa

02:52.923 --> 02:55.005
And you can play the guitar

02:55.258 --> 02:57.374
Oh, whoa-- whoa-- whoa

02:57.636 --> 02:59.592
You can bang on the drums

02:59.846 --> 03:01.461
Oh, whoa-- whoa-- whoa

03:01.723 --> 03:04.681
Or you can sing like a star

03:04.935 --> 03:06.425
And the music

03:06.687 --> 03:08.803
Yeah, the music

03:09.064 --> 03:11.430
Gets us to the top

03:15.028 --> 03:17.861
As we learn
how the rainbow

03:18.115 --> 03:20.071
Rainbow rocks

03:23.954 --> 03:26.366
As we learn
how the rainbow

03:26.623 --> 03:28.784
Rainbow rocks.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.468
( chatter)

04:09.332 --> 04:12.950
- Want some help?
- Uh, no, thanks. We're good.

04:14.296 --> 04:16.286
Oh, okay.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.918
Sunset Shimmer,
over here!

04:22.095 --> 04:24.586
( chatter continues )

04:24.848 --> 04:27.806
(gasping, whispering )

04:30.729 --> 04:34.438
(sighs) I had no idea
the whole school would be here.

04:37.861 --> 04:40.728
Quite the eye-catching
advertisement if I do say so myself.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.479
And it smells like cake.

04:42.741 --> 04:45.403
It does?
( sniffs )

04:45.660 --> 04:47.776
I used frosting
instead of paste.

04:48.038 --> 04:51.656
Uh, Fluttershy, you've got
a little something... uh...

04:54.044 --> 04:57.036
- Did I get it?
- Not exactly.

04:59.216 --> 05:00.831
Good afternoon,
students.

05:01.092 --> 05:03.003
Ijust wanted
to tell you all

05:03.261 --> 05:05.593
how pleased I am
that so many of you

05:05.847 --> 05:07.883
are going to participate
in the first ever

05:08.141 --> 05:10.553
Canterlot High School
musical showcase.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.427
( cheering )

05:14.815 --> 05:16.646
This is a wonderful
opportunity

05:16.900 --> 05:19.357
to raise money for all
our after-school programs

05:19.611 --> 05:20.851
here at CHS.

05:21.112 --> 05:23.228
So keep working on
those signs and posters.

05:23.490 --> 05:24.946
I think it's going to be

05:25.200 --> 05:27.987
one of the most exciting
events we've had at CHS

05:28.245 --> 05:30.861
since the Fall Formal.

05:43.093 --> 05:45.880
I am never gonna
live that down.

05:46.137 --> 05:48.344
You were pretty bad
at the Fall Formal.

05:48.598 --> 05:52.887
A demon. I turned into
a raging she-demon.

05:53.144 --> 05:54.759
And tried to turn everyone here
into teenage zombies

05:55.021 --> 05:57.433
for your own
personal army.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.852
Oh, darling, you have us.

06:00.110 --> 06:03.227
And we've forgiven you
for your past-- ahem-- boo-boos.

06:03.488 --> 06:05.774
To be honest, I'd say
the whole experience

06:06.032 --> 06:09.274
brought everyone at Canterlot High
closer than ever before.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.072
One, two, three.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.194
There was a time
we were apart

06:13.456 --> 06:15.242
But that's behind us now

06:15.500 --> 06:17.786
See how we've made
a brand-new start

06:18.044 --> 06:19.659
And the future's
looking up

06:19.921 --> 06:20.956
Oh, oh

06:21.214 --> 06:22.545
And when you
walk these halls

06:22.799 --> 06:24.915
You feel it everywhere

06:25.176 --> 06:27.883
Yeah, we're
the Wondercolts forever

06:28.138 --> 06:29.253
Oh, yeah

06:29.514 --> 06:32.005
We are all together

06:32.267 --> 06:33.632
Oh, oh, oh

06:33.894 --> 06:36.510
Now is better than ever

06:36.771 --> 06:38.227
Oh, oh, oh

06:38.481 --> 06:39.937
You can feel it

06:40.191 --> 06:45.060
We are back and I 'm so glad
that we're better

06:45.322 --> 06:47.062
Better than ever

06:47.324 --> 06:49.235
Oh, wha, oh, wha, oh

06:49.492 --> 06:51.574
Oh, yeah,
we're better than ever

06:51.828 --> 06:54.661
Oh, wha, oh, wha, oh

06:54.915 --> 06:58.954
There was a time we couldn't see
past the differences

06:59.210 --> 07:03.374
That separated you and me
and it left us on our own

07:04.674 --> 07:06.289
But now you walk these halls

07:06.551 --> 07:08.337
And friends are everywhere

07:08.595 --> 07:11.462
Yeah, we're
the Wondercolts forever

07:11.723 --> 07:12.803
Oh, yeah

07:13.058 --> 07:15.595
We are all together

07:15.852 --> 07:17.217
Oh, oh, oh

07:17.479 --> 07:19.811
Now is better than ever

07:20.065 --> 07:21.396
Oh, oh, oh

07:21.650 --> 07:24.983
Now that we are back on track

07:25.236 --> 07:28.945
Yes, I 'm so glad that we're better

07:29.199 --> 07:30.905
Better than ever

07:31.159 --> 07:32.695
Oh, wha, oh, wha, oh

07:32.953 --> 07:35.069
Oh, yeah,
we're better than ever

07:35.330 --> 07:37.070
Oh, wha, oh, wha, oh

07:37.332 --> 07:39.243
Oh, yeah,
we're better than ever

07:39.501 --> 07:41.457
Oh, wha, oh, wha, oh

07:41.711 --> 07:44.544
Oh, yeah,
we're better than ever.

07:47.258 --> 07:50.671
( laughs) I still can't believe
that happens when we play.

07:50.929 --> 07:53.591
Ooh, I've got to look
into some new accessories.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.964
Something that looks good
in a longer ponytail.

07:56.226 --> 07:57.887
Ooh, maybe some
clip-on earrings

07:58.144 --> 08:00.226
for when I get those
adorable pony ears.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.721
I just wonder
why it happens.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.565
Princess Twilight took
her crown back to Equestria.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.151
Shouldn't that mean she took
all the magic back with her?

08:08.405 --> 08:10.646
Who cares why it happens?

08:10.907 --> 08:13.239
It makes my band
totally awesome.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.233
Oh, your band?

08:15.495 --> 08:17.861
Duh, it was my idea
to start the Rainbooms

08:18.123 --> 08:19.533
so we could be
in the showcase.

08:19.791 --> 08:21.372
Plus, I'm the lead singer
and guitarist.

08:21.626 --> 08:22.661
( knock on door)

08:22.919 --> 08:24.705
Heard you outside.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.578
You guys are sounding
really tight.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.546
Uh, we're getting there.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.041
Rarity's still coming in a little late
on the second verse

08:31.302 --> 08:34.169
and App|ejack's bass solo
could use a little work.

08:34.431 --> 08:36.592
They'll get it together
in time for the showcase.

08:38.308 --> 08:39.845
Uh, I don't suppose

08:40.102 --> 08:43.561
any of our friends
from out of town might come?

08:43.815 --> 08:45.771
It being a special
charity event and all.

08:46.026 --> 08:49.143
Sorry, Flash, I don't think
Twilight's gonna be back

08:49.404 --> 08:51.144
at Canterlot
High any time soon.

08:51.406 --> 08:53.522
Oh, yeah. Okay.

08:53.783 --> 08:56.024
Just, you know,
thought I'd ask.

08:56.286 --> 08:59.028
Uh, keep on rocking it.

09:01.916 --> 09:05.283
Well, someone is quite
the smitten kitten.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.251
Ooh, sorry.

09:07.505 --> 09:10.247
I always forget you and Flash
used to be an item.

09:10.508 --> 09:11.497
It's okay.

09:11.760 --> 09:12.715
Flash is a great guy and all,

09:12.969 --> 09:14.800
but I never really
liked him liked him.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.341
I was just using him
to become more popular.

09:17.599 --> 09:20.591
(sighs ) The old me
really was just awful, wasn't she?

09:20.852 --> 09:22.888
— ( muttering )
- Yup.

09:23.146 --> 09:25.979
But the important thing
is that you've turned yourself around.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.472
Thanks, Applejack.

09:27.734 --> 09:31.397
But I'm not sure everyone else
at CHS feels the same way.

09:31.654 --> 09:34.521
Woman on P.A.: Sunset Shimmer,
please report to the main foyer.

09:34.783 --> 09:38.116
Gotta run. I volunteered to show some
new students around the school.

09:38.369 --> 09:40.451
Thought it would be good
for them to get to know the new me

09:40.705 --> 09:44.072
before they heard
all the stuff about the old me.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.826
We've still got a few minutes
before lunch starts,

09:48.088 --> 09:50.500
what do you say we do
"Awesome as I Wanna Be"?

09:50.757 --> 09:52.588
Um, Rainbow Dash,

09:52.842 --> 09:55.925
I was wondering if we maybe
could play the song I wrote.

09:56.179 --> 09:57.885
We'll get to it.

09:58.139 --> 09:59.845
Oh, okay.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.474
Hi. Are you the girls
I'm supposed to show around?

10:03.728 --> 10:05.719
We are.

10:07.565 --> 10:09.271
Canterlot High
is a great school.

10:09.526 --> 10:10.606
You're really
gonna love it.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.191
Oh, yes.

10:12.445 --> 10:16.563
We really sense there's something
magical about this place.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.035
That's the science lab.

10:23.289 --> 10:24.870
Computer lab
is in there.

10:25.125 --> 10:28.333
Ooh, we're having a big
musical showcase this weekend.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.872
The whole school is
pretty much rallying around it.

10:31.131 --> 10:34.544
A musical showcase?

10:34.801 --> 10:37.258
I'm sure since you're new,
Principal Celestia

10:37.512 --> 10:39.423
will let you sign up
if you're interested.

10:39.681 --> 10:42.718
We have been known to sing
from time to time.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.888
Hello?
We sing, like, all the time.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.307
It's how we get people
to do what we want.

10:48.565 --> 10:51.272
- ( groans )
- What did I say?

10:51.526 --> 10:53.141
What you meant to say

10:53.403 --> 10:55.268
was that being in
a musical showcase

10:55.530 --> 10:58.192
sounds like a great way
to meet other students.

10:58.449 --> 10:59.734
Oh, yeah.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.483
What she said,
I meant to say.

11:01.744 --> 11:03.735
That's what I meant...
to say.

11:03.997 --> 11:07.990
And what you would have said
if you weren't the worst.

11:08.251 --> 11:09.536
You are.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.284
You have to excuse them.
They're idiots.

11:11.546 --> 11:12.581
Both: Hmmph.

11:18.928 --> 11:21.044
Sunset:
Those are pretty.

11:21.306 --> 11:23.922
Where did you--

11:24.184 --> 11:26.015
( laughs)

11:26.269 --> 11:29.181
Sorry. These pendants
mean an awful lot to us.

11:29.439 --> 11:31.976
We'd just hate for anything
to happen to them.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.821
( chatter)

11:47.749 --> 11:50.411
- So how was the tour?
- I don't know.

11:50.668 --> 11:52.454
I mean, these girls,
they were--

11:52.712 --> 11:54.418
there was something off
about them.

11:54.672 --> 11:56.287
Like off like this?

11:56.549 --> 11:57.789
Or off like this?

11:58.051 --> 11:59.291
Or-- ooh, |ike--

11:59.552 --> 12:03.090
Maybe we should
just let her tell us?

12:03.348 --> 12:05.805
That's just it.
I can't put my finger on it.

12:06.059 --> 12:09.301
They just acted sort of
strange around me.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.848
Maybe someone already
talked to them.

12:12.106 --> 12:13.562
Told them about what I did.

12:13.816 --> 12:16.683
(sighs ) So much for making
a good first impression.

12:16.945 --> 12:19.027
Uh—huh.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.896
Ooh, that's
probably not it.

12:25.036 --> 12:26.276
This is it, girls.

12:26.537 --> 12:28.073
The moment we've
been waiting for.

12:28.331 --> 12:29.662
Lunch?

12:29.916 --> 12:33.329
(groans ) The chance to get our
true Equestrian magic back.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.793
Oh, right.

12:36.047 --> 12:37.457
Our voices are
just strong enough

12:37.715 --> 12:40.001
to make them want
something so badly,

12:40.260 --> 12:42.421
they'll fight to get it.

12:42.679 --> 12:45.512
So we're just gonna do
what we always do?

12:45.765 --> 12:48.302
Stir up some trouble
and then feed off the negative energy?

12:48.559 --> 12:50.299
Some plan, Adagio.

12:50.561 --> 12:52.893
It won't be the same
as the times before.

12:53.147 --> 12:55.229
There is Equestrian
magic here.

12:55.483 --> 12:59.021
Their negative energy
will give us the power we need

12:59.279 --> 13:02.316
to get this entire world
to do our bidding.

13:02.573 --> 13:04.655
But we can get lunch after,
though, right?

13:04.909 --> 13:07.321
It's Taco Tuesday.

13:07.578 --> 13:09.944
- Just follow my lead.
- Or my lead.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.162
My lead.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.670
(vocalizing )

13:36.941 --> 13:40.433
We heard you want
to get together

13:40.695 --> 13:45.155
We heard you want
to rock this school

13:46.617 --> 13:50.235
We've got something
that is better

13:51.622 --> 13:55.535
Something that changes
all the rules

13:56.961 --> 13:59.577
Why pretend
we're all the same?

14:00.882 --> 14:04.591
When some of us
shine brighter

14:06.262 --> 14:09.129
Here's a chance
to find your flame

14:10.808 --> 14:14.175
Are you a loser or a fighter?

14:15.355 --> 14:17.687
Me and you,
you and me

14:17.940 --> 14:20.431
Why don't we see
who is better?

14:20.693 --> 14:24.902
We don't have to be
one and the same thing

14:25.156 --> 14:29.490
Oh, what's so wrong
with a little competition?

14:29.744 --> 14:34.909
Are you afraid of failing
the audition?

14:35.166 --> 14:38.033
You're a star
and you should know it

14:39.837 --> 14:43.170
Now you rise above the rest

14:44.509 --> 14:47.467
It doesn't matter who you hurt

14:49.430 --> 14:52.137
If you're just proving
you're the best

14:52.392 --> 14:54.348
(vocalizing )

14:56.104 --> 14:59.688
Battle,
you want to win it

14:59.941 --> 15:01.772
Let's have a battle

15:02.026 --> 15:04.483
Battle of the bands

15:04.737 --> 15:06.318
Let's have a battle

15:06.572 --> 15:09.314
We'll go all in it

15:09.575 --> 15:11.361
Let's have a battle

15:11.619 --> 15:13.860
Battle, battle

15:14.122 --> 15:15.658
Battle of the bands...

15:15.915 --> 15:17.451
I can beat you.

15:17.708 --> 15:19.790
- Battle...
- Ha! You wish.

15:20.044 --> 15:22.205
- Battle...
- I so want this.

15:22.463 --> 15:24.454
- Battle...
- Not ifl get it first.

15:24.715 --> 15:27.172
Me and you,
you and me

15:27.427 --> 15:29.964
Why don't we see
who is better?

15:30.221 --> 15:34.385
We don't have to be
one and the same thing

15:34.642 --> 15:39.261
Oh, what's so wrong
with a little competition?

15:39.522 --> 15:43.640
I'm going out there,
winning the audition

15:43.901 --> 15:45.357
Battle

15:45.611 --> 15:47.647
We want to win it

15:47.905 --> 15:49.816
Let's have a battle

15:50.074 --> 15:52.486
Battle of the bands

15:52.743 --> 15:54.984
Let's have a battle

15:55.246 --> 15:57.202
We'll go all in it

15:57.457 --> 15:59.197
Let's have a battle

15:59.459 --> 16:01.745
Battle, battle

16:02.003 --> 16:04.460
Battle of the bands.

16:08.009 --> 16:11.297
Oh, they're
that kind of off.

16:15.725 --> 16:18.387
Those three are definitely
in possession

16:18.644 --> 16:19.884
of some kind
of dark magic.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.353
How else could you explain
what happened back there?

16:22.607 --> 16:25.474
Don't worry, y'all. We let Principal
Celestia know all about this

16:25.735 --> 16:27.817
and those girls will be kicked
to the curb in no time.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.982
Last thing she needs
is another CHS event

16:31.240 --> 16:34.573
almost ruined by some
power-crazed lunatic.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.033
Uh, no offense.

16:36.287 --> 16:38.243
(sighs)
None taken.

16:42.210 --> 16:43.541
Dark magic?

16:43.794 --> 16:46.251
I find that
very hard to believe.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.121
Those girls came into
my office earlier

16:48.382 --> 16:50.122
and were
absolutely delightful.

16:50.384 --> 16:52.340
Perhaps Sunset Shimmer

16:52.595 --> 16:54.927
is just eager to make someone
else out to be a bad element

16:55.181 --> 16:58.264
so that her actions at the Fall Formal
will become old news.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.383
I could see why
you might think that, but--

17:00.645 --> 17:02.055
That's not what's happening.

17:02.313 --> 17:04.929
We saw all of this go down
in the cafeteria, too.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.352
Yes, but isn't your band

17:07.609 --> 17:10.477
supposed to be part of
the musical showcase?

17:10.738 --> 17:11.772
Yes.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.646
Perhaps you're all
just worried

17:13.907 --> 17:15.489
that the Dazzlings
will steal your spotlight.

17:15.742 --> 17:17.483
The Dazzlings?

17:17.744 --> 17:19.484
It's the name
of their musical group.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.362
That's why they came by
my office earlier.

17:21.624 --> 17:22.829
To sign up for the showcase.

17:23.084 --> 17:26.247
Even sang a little song
to Vice Principal Luna and I.

17:26.503 --> 17:28.995
- They did?
- Yes.

17:29.257 --> 17:31.043
And we think having
a battle of the bands

17:31.300 --> 17:33.837
instead is
a marvelous idea.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.806
I can't believe they got
to Principal Celestia

17:44.063 --> 17:45.803
and Vice Principal Luna, too.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.396
They've gotten
to everybody.

17:47.650 --> 17:50.733
- Not everybody.
- Pinkie Pie's right.

17:50.987 --> 17:52.523
We were there when
the Dazzlings were singing

17:52.780 --> 17:54.145
and we weren't affected.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.068
It was like we were
protected somehow.

17:56.325 --> 17:57.986
So let's take them down.

17:58.244 --> 18:01.031
It's not like we haven't tangled
with dark magic before

18:01.289 --> 18:03.655
and totally whupped
its sorry butt.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.872
Uh, no offense.

18:06.127 --> 18:08.334
(sighs)
None taken.

18:08.588 --> 18:09.748
Again.

18:10.006 --> 18:11.712
But that was when
Twilight was here.

18:11.966 --> 18:14.048
There may be some kind
of magic inside us,

18:14.302 --> 18:16.133
but it only comes out
when we play music.

18:16.387 --> 18:18.469
I sure don't know
how to use it

18:18.723 --> 18:22.307
to "whup anybody's butt."

18:22.560 --> 18:24.801
If only we could get
a message to Twilight.

18:25.062 --> 18:26.802
Maybe she could tell us
how to break the spell

18:27.064 --> 18:28.600
the Dazzlings have cast
on our friends.

18:28.858 --> 18:30.519
Well, that's not gonna happen.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.937
The porta|'s closed.

18:33.195 --> 18:34.480
( screams )

18:34.739 --> 18:35.979
And I get the feeling

18:36.240 --> 18:38.731
they don't exactly have
cell phones where she's from.

18:41.162 --> 18:42.527
I may have an idea

18:42.788 --> 18:44.904
how we can get in touch
with Princess Twilight.

18:52.673 --> 18:55.506
When I was Princess Ce|estia's
student back in Equestria,

18:55.760 --> 18:58.467
she gave me this.

18:58.721 --> 19:01.588
Even after I abandoned my studies,
I held on to it.

19:01.849 --> 19:04.636
Deep down, I guess I knew
I was making a big mistake

19:04.894 --> 19:07.351
and I still wanted a way
to reach out to her.

19:10.066 --> 19:11.647
Maybe it still works.

19:11.901 --> 19:13.766
Rarity:
That's a book, darling.

19:14.028 --> 19:15.859
What do you mean
maybe still works?

19:16.113 --> 19:18.274
It used to be that
if I wrote something here,

19:18.532 --> 19:22.070
it would appear in the pages of a book
back in Princess Ce|estia's library.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.068
I get a message to her,

19:24.330 --> 19:26.821
then she can get a message
to Princess Twilight.

19:27.083 --> 19:30.075
So what are you waiting for?
Get to writing.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.006
Huh.

19:38.260 --> 19:41.047
Been a longtime since
I've written these words.

19:42.431 --> 19:45.138
"Dear Princess Ce|estia."

20:19.343 --> 20:21.174
Excuse me, Princess,

20:21.429 --> 20:22.885
where do you want all these
books from Princess Celestia?

20:23.139 --> 20:26.302
The library.
Third door on the left.

20:26.559 --> 20:29.141
Even this one that's glowing
and vibrating?

20:40.573 --> 20:41.904
What is it, Twilight?

20:42.158 --> 20:44.945
It looks like a message
to Princess Celestia

20:45.202 --> 20:46.658
from my friends
at Canterlot High.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.324
How is that even possible?

20:49.582 --> 20:50.662
I have no idea,

20:50.916 --> 20:53.749
but it sounds like
they need my help.

20:57.381 --> 20:58.996
The way Sunset Shimmer
described them,

20:59.258 --> 21:01.214
I think these new girls
sound an awful lot like

21:01.469 --> 21:03.755
the Sirens.

21:04.013 --> 21:05.844
Not the Sirens!

21:06.098 --> 21:09.181
I don't actually know
what that is.

21:09.435 --> 21:12.723
The Sirens were three beautiful
but dangerous creatures

21:12.980 --> 21:15.892
who had the power to charm
ponies with their music.

21:16.150 --> 21:17.686
But to maintain this power,

21:17.943 --> 21:20.980
they had to feed on the negativity
and distrust of others.

21:21.238 --> 21:23.775
The more of this
negative energy they consumed,

21:24.033 --> 21:26.115
the stronger
their voices became

21:26.368 --> 21:28.825
and the farther they could
spread their dark magic.

21:29.079 --> 21:31.536
I don't think I like
this story very much.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.782
Twilight:
If the Sirens had their way,

21:34.043 --> 21:36.409
they would have divided
and conquered all of Equestria.

21:36.670 --> 21:39.958
But a certain Star Swirl the Bearded
wasn't having it.

21:40.216 --> 21:43.959
Rumor has it he found a way
to banish them to another world.

21:44.220 --> 21:47.178
One where he believed
their magic power would be lost.

21:49.475 --> 21:52.387
That world must have been the one
where my Canterlot High friends live.

21:52.645 --> 21:55.557
But Star Swirl must have
sent them there ages ago.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.646
How come they're
just surfacing now?

21:57.900 --> 21:59.891
I don't know,
but if my hunch is right

22:00.152 --> 22:02.518
and it is the Sirens
who have come to Canterlot High,

22:02.780 --> 22:05.396
this spell they've cast
is just the beginning.

22:05.658 --> 22:08.616
My friends need me.
I have to get back to them.

22:08.869 --> 22:10.655
I hate to burst your bubble,
Twilight,

22:10.913 --> 22:13.154
but the connection between
their world and Equestria

22:13.415 --> 22:16.407
will still be totally cut off
for a super long time.

22:16.669 --> 22:19.081
Okay, first of all, if there was bubble
blowing going on,

22:19.338 --> 22:20.794
why wasn't I told about it?

22:21.048 --> 22:24.165
And secondly, if the connection
is totally cut off,

22:24.426 --> 22:27.839
how was Sunset Shimmer
able to get a message to Twilight?

22:28.097 --> 22:31.715
( gasps )
Pinkie, you're a genius.

22:31.976 --> 22:33.591
Yeah, I get that a lot.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.639
Now about those bubbles.

22:49.994 --> 22:52.030
Twilight: ...and the interval between
the two points is defined

22:52.288 --> 22:54.199
as the square root of the sum
of the squares of the separation

22:54.456 --> 22:56.822
between the points along
three spatial dimensions.

22:58.961 --> 23:00.997
- Say what now?
- Duh.

23:01.255 --> 23:04.793
She's gonna take the magic
in here and put it in there.

23:05.050 --> 23:07.462
That'l| make the portal open up
so that whenever she wants to,

23:07.720 --> 23:09.301
she can go
from here to there.

23:09.555 --> 23:11.511
There to here.
Here-there.

23:11.765 --> 23:15.053
- There to here. Here to there. There--
- We get the idea.

23:17.146 --> 23:19.432
Now to see
if it actually works.

23:31.452 --> 23:33.659
All: Ooh.

23:58.687 --> 24:00.769
All: Ahh.

24:01.023 --> 24:03.981
Don't suppose we could
join you this time around?

24:04.234 --> 24:05.565
Better not.

24:05.819 --> 24:07.525
It could make things
pretty confusing if Canterlot High

24:07.780 --> 24:10.021
all of a sudden had
two of all of you.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.023
(all "oh" )

24:13.285 --> 24:14.695
But I still get to go, right?

24:14.954 --> 24:16.865
There isn't another one of me
at Canterlot High.

24:17.122 --> 24:19.488
And you never know when you might
need your trusty assistant.

24:19.750 --> 24:23.584
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes!

24:23.837 --> 24:25.418
We won't be gone long.

24:25.673 --> 24:27.755
( overlapping chatter)

24:28.008 --> 24:29.919
And don't forget
to dress well.

24:33.597 --> 24:36.088
Ready, Spike?

24:37.226 --> 24:38.591
Ready.

25:03.502 --> 25:06.915
(sighs) I'm starting to think
she's not coming.

25:08.882 --> 25:10.167
All:
Twilight!

25:10.426 --> 25:13.463
Ooh. I'm back.

25:21.270 --> 25:23.761
All:
Oh, Twilight.

25:24.023 --> 25:26.765
I've got some bad news
about those new girls.

25:27.026 --> 25:28.641
(all groan)

25:33.282 --> 25:35.614
Oh, I do hate that you had
to return at a time of crisis.

25:35.868 --> 25:38.075
We have so much
catching up to do.

25:38.328 --> 25:41.820
For starters, a certain blue-haired
guitar player was just asking about you.

25:42.082 --> 25:44.994
Flash Sentry
was asking about me?

25:45.252 --> 25:48.710
Ahem.
Isn't that nice?

25:48.964 --> 25:52.377
Perhaps you could give us just the
slightest bit of gossip from your world?

25:52.634 --> 25:54.340
She's got
an official title now.

25:54.595 --> 25:58.929
( mimics trumpet fanfare)
The Princess of Friendship.

25:59.183 --> 26:01.640
Wow, that's
really impressive.

26:01.894 --> 26:04.977
Guess you really were
Princess Ce|estia's prize pupil.

26:05.230 --> 26:07.095
She's even got
her own castle.

26:07.357 --> 26:08.642
A castle?!

26:08.901 --> 26:10.391
You have your own castle?!

26:10.652 --> 26:12.768
Uh, ahem.

26:13.030 --> 26:14.645
Oh, lovely.

26:14.907 --> 26:15.987
What's new here?

26:16.241 --> 26:18.277
I mean, besides your school
becoming the target

26:18.535 --> 26:20.867
of dangerous magical creatures
from Equestria.

26:21.121 --> 26:23.658
Yeah,
so that isn't exactly

26:23.916 --> 26:26.032
the only strange thing
that's happened since you left.

26:26.293 --> 26:27.499
( music playing )

26:27.753 --> 26:29.994
...and I'm so glad
that we're better...

26:30.255 --> 26:32.416
Pretty sweet, huh?

26:32.674 --> 26:34.960
It happens to all of us
when we play.

26:35.219 --> 26:38.006
Hmm. My crown
was returned to Equestria,

26:38.263 --> 26:41.175
but some of its magic must have
remained here at Canterlot High.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.923
Now that we're
all back together,

26:43.185 --> 26:44.891
we can use that magic
on the Sirens.

26:45.145 --> 26:47.101
Just like when we were able to use it
on Sunset Shimmer

26:47.356 --> 26:51.099
when she turned into
that horrifyingly awful winged monster.

26:51.360 --> 26:52.475
No offense.

26:52.736 --> 26:54.852
None taken.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.650
I'm used to it.

26:56.907 --> 26:58.863
They'll never even know
what hit ‘em.

26:59.118 --> 27:00.779
(grunting)

27:03.122 --> 27:05.579
We've got nothing to worry about
now that Twilight's back.

27:05.833 --> 27:09.576
Oh, I'm pretty sure I could
find something to worry about.

27:09.837 --> 27:11.623
But it won't be the Sirens.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.495
The sooner we do this,
the better.

27:13.757 --> 27:15.748
Any idea where
the Dazzlings might be?

27:18.595 --> 27:21.382
(slurps)
Ahh.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.050
There's a big party tonight
for all the bands

27:23.308 --> 27:24.593
who signed up
to be in the showcase.

27:24.852 --> 27:26.592
That would include
the Dazzlings.

27:29.690 --> 27:31.976
Looks like we've got
a party to crash.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.608
( chatter)

27:48.834 --> 27:50.950
(sighs)
I'm gonna get more punch.

27:53.297 --> 27:54.833
Twilight?

27:55.090 --> 27:57.081
Oh, bumped into--

27:57.342 --> 27:58.798
always doing...

27:59.052 --> 28:00.792
What are you doing here?

28:01.054 --> 28:03.215
You came back for
the big competition, right?

28:03.473 --> 28:05.134
Something like that.

28:05.392 --> 28:07.758
Not that there's going to be
any real competition.

28:08.020 --> 28:11.057
No one here wants this
as bad as my band does.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.907
( chatter)

28:25.078 --> 28:27.160
Can you excuse me
forjust a minute?

28:38.175 --> 28:40.131
( overlapping conversations )

28:45.140 --> 28:48.132
Adagio:
Oh, no. No one's mingling.

28:48.393 --> 28:51.100
It's like there's some kind
of underlying tension

28:51.355 --> 28:53.437
that could bubble
to the surface at any minute.

28:53.690 --> 28:54.975
It's the fruit punch,
isn't it?

28:55.234 --> 28:57.099
I knew I used
too much grape juice.

28:57.361 --> 28:59.977
It's not the fruit punch,
it's us.

29:00.239 --> 29:02.446
But the punch is awful, too.

29:02.699 --> 29:04.860
What do you know
about good fruit punch?

29:05.118 --> 29:06.278
More than you.

29:06.536 --> 29:08.492
- Do not.
- Do, too.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.159
This is just
the kickoff party, girls.

29:11.416 --> 29:13.281
Imagine what a tizzy
they'll be in

29:13.543 --> 29:15.784
by the time the battle of
the bands starts.

29:16.046 --> 29:18.833
There isn't going to be
a battle of the bands.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.706
We're gonna make sure
of that.

29:22.094 --> 29:25.552
All right, girls,
let's do this.

29:28.767 --> 29:32.385
Friendship is magic.

29:42.823 --> 29:46.611
Uh, weren't there rainbows
and lasers and stuff last time?

29:46.868 --> 29:48.358
I don't understand.

29:48.620 --> 29:49.905
We're all together again.

29:50.163 --> 29:52.404
Why isn't this working?

29:57.796 --> 29:59.377
You, uh, really
need to go ahead

29:59.631 --> 30:01.587
and do that whole
"magic of friendship" thing now.

30:01.842 --> 30:03.207
I'm trying, Spike.

30:03.468 --> 30:05.379
I thought the six of us standing
together against the Sirens

30:05.637 --> 30:07.719
would bring out the magic
we needed to defeat them.

30:07.973 --> 30:09.713
That's what happened before.

30:09.975 --> 30:12.387
Talk about throwing down
the gauntlet.

30:12.644 --> 30:15.932
This group is obviously
serious about winning.

30:16.189 --> 30:17.850
A little cocky,
though, aren't they?

30:18.108 --> 30:20.224
Claiming there won't
really be a battle.

30:20.485 --> 30:24.524
Seems they think they've already got
this thing all locked up.

30:24.781 --> 30:28.990
Not if the great and powerful
Trixie has anything to do with it.

30:29.244 --> 30:30.654
Whatever, Trixie.

30:30.912 --> 30:32.402
We're the best band at CHS.

30:32.664 --> 30:35.280
No. The Crusaders
are gonna win.

30:35.542 --> 30:37.498
( overlapping chatter)

30:53.185 --> 30:56.018
Adagio: I think we may have found
what we're looking for.

30:56.271 --> 30:59.388
Or rather,
it found us.

31:03.528 --> 31:06.019
Magic.
Don't you see?

31:06.281 --> 31:08.943
Everyone else has fallen
under our spell.

31:09.201 --> 31:10.987
But not these girls.

31:11.244 --> 31:13.860
These girls are special.

31:18.126 --> 31:19.866
It doesn't make any sense.

31:20.128 --> 31:21.664
I should have been able
to create the spark

31:21.922 --> 31:23.128
that would help us
break their spell.

31:23.382 --> 31:25.373
That's how it worked before.

31:25.634 --> 31:29.126
But to defeat me, you drew magic
from the crown I was wearing.

31:29.388 --> 31:32.630
The Sirens‘ magic
comes from their music...

31:32.891 --> 31:36.759
so maybe you have to use
the same kind of magic to defeat them.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.681
Or maybe not.

31:38.939 --> 31:42.477
- No, I think you're onto something.
- Really?

31:42.734 --> 31:45.601
It's when you play music
that you transform now, right?

31:45.862 --> 31:48.319
Yup. Ears, tails,
the whole shebang.

31:48.573 --> 31:51.155
So maybe the way to use that magic
to defeat the Sirens

31:51.410 --> 31:53.241
is by playing a musical
counterspell.

31:53.495 --> 31:56.237
- You mean like a song?
- Uh—huh.

31:56.498 --> 31:59.240
And in order to free everyone
who's been exposed to the Sirens spell,

31:59.501 --> 32:01.082
we'll need them all
to hear it.

32:01.336 --> 32:02.826
All: Hmm.

32:03.088 --> 32:05.955
( gasps )
The band competition.

32:06.216 --> 32:07.672
That's the next time
we can be certain

32:07.926 --> 32:10.042
everyone will be in the same place
at the same time.

32:10.303 --> 32:12.510
Guess the Rainbooms are
the band to beat.

32:12.764 --> 32:14.504
And I believe,
you, Twilight,

32:14.766 --> 32:17.849
just became the Rainbooms‘
newest member.

32:18.103 --> 32:20.059
(giggling)

32:23.108 --> 32:24.814
So what do you
want to play?

32:25.068 --> 32:27.104
Triangle?
Sousaphone?

32:28.196 --> 32:30.152
- Theremin?
- ( music playing )

32:34.119 --> 32:36.701
So magical.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.536
I might take
a little too long

32:38.790 --> 32:40.576
to learn how to play
something with these.

32:40.834 --> 32:42.040
I'll just sing.

32:42.294 --> 32:44.034
Like as in lead singer?

32:44.296 --> 32:46.537
‘Cause that's
usually my gig.

32:46.798 --> 32:48.208
This being
my band and all.

32:48.467 --> 32:49.957
It's our band.

32:50.218 --> 32:51.879
And of course
as lead singer.

32:52.137 --> 32:55.174
She's the one with the magical knowhow
to help us pull this thing off.

32:55.432 --> 32:57.218
Okay, yeah, that's cool.

32:57.476 --> 32:59.057
I'll just use this
as a chance

32:59.311 --> 33:02.644
to hone my already insanely
good lead guitar skills.

33:02.898 --> 33:04.604
It's only temporary.

33:04.858 --> 33:06.814
And we don't have to win
the battle of the bands.

33:07.068 --> 33:09.901
We just have to perform during
the first round of the competition.

33:10.155 --> 33:12.612
So let's get to learning
that musical counterspell.

33:12.866 --> 33:15.653
Well, that's just it.
I don't know any.

33:15.911 --> 33:17.242
(all sigh)

33:17.496 --> 33:20.078
But I'm sure I could
figure out how to write one.

33:20.332 --> 33:23.449
Totally. Twilight can write a spell
like it's nobody's business.

33:23.710 --> 33:26.577
That's pretty much how she got to become
a princess in Equestria.

33:26.838 --> 33:29.079
Technically,
I helped finish a spell.

33:29.341 --> 33:31.297
And there was a little more
to it than that, Spike.

33:31.551 --> 33:33.416
Yeah, whatever.

33:33.678 --> 33:34.838
I've got this.

33:35.096 --> 33:36.256
Come on.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.051
Where are you going?

33:38.308 --> 33:39.514
Well,
last time we were here,

33:39.768 --> 33:41.429
Spike and I spent the night
in the library.

33:41.686 --> 33:43.142
Are you crazy?

33:43.396 --> 33:45.182
We're besties now.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.146
Slumber party at my house.

33:51.363 --> 33:54.321
Status update--
okey dokey, Loki.

34:09.339 --> 34:11.625
Hey.
I was about to beat you.

34:11.882 --> 34:12.963
I doubt it.

34:13.217 --> 34:15.800
So, Twilight, how's that
counterspell coming?

34:16.054 --> 34:18.887
Huh? Oh, uh, good. Great.

34:19.139 --> 34:21.552
Thanks for letting me
use your notebook, Fluttershy.

34:21.810 --> 34:23.971
I really like the song
you wrote for the Rainbooms.

34:24.228 --> 34:25.639
Thanks.
(smhs)

34:25.897 --> 34:28.434
Hopefully one day,
we'll get a chance to play it.

34:28.692 --> 34:30.523
-( laughing)
- Hey!

34:32.404 --> 34:34.895
Twilight, I think I speak
for all of us when I say

34:35.156 --> 34:38.148
I don't know what we would've done
if you hadn't come back to help us.

34:38.409 --> 34:39.489
All: Uh—huh.

34:39.744 --> 34:41.154
(doorbell rings)

34:41.413 --> 34:42.994
Pizza's here.

34:52.716 --> 34:54.001
(sighs)

34:54.259 --> 34:55.998
Don't you want any pizza?

35:09.816 --> 35:12.057
(snoﬁng)

35:41.222 --> 35:43.178
No, that's not gonna work.

35:44.225 --> 35:46.887
Hey, Twilight.
You're up late.

35:47.145 --> 35:49.727
Just looking over
the counterspell.

35:49.981 --> 35:52.848
We only get one shot at this.
It has to be perfect.

35:53.109 --> 35:55.475
We really are lucky
you're here.

35:55.737 --> 35:57.728
That's what everyone
keeps telling me.

35:57.989 --> 36:01.152
Who could possibly need
this much whipped cream?

36:01.409 --> 36:02.865
It must be nice
to have everyone

36:03.119 --> 36:05.656
always looking to you
for answers to their problems

36:05.914 --> 36:08.621
instead of waiting for you
to cause a problem.

36:08.875 --> 36:10.991
Just because everyone
expects something from you

36:11.252 --> 36:12.913
doesn't mean it's guaranteed
to happen.

36:13.171 --> 36:15.412
But that doesn't stop them
from expecting it.

36:15.674 --> 36:16.914
Which only make things harder

36:17.175 --> 36:19.131
because the last thing
you want to do is...

36:19.386 --> 36:21.798
Both:
Let everybody down.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.303
( screams )

36:27.560 --> 36:29.642
Boulder was hungry.

36:37.862 --> 36:41.150
I still can't get over the fact that
she's related to Pinkie Pie.

36:41.408 --> 36:43.615
You and me both.

36:43.868 --> 36:46.280
( yawns )
I better get some sleep.

36:46.538 --> 36:47.903
Good luck with
the counterspell.

36:48.164 --> 36:49.404
Not that you'll need it.

36:49.666 --> 36:51.327
This must be nothing
compared to the stuff

36:51.584 --> 36:54.917
you're expected to deal with
as a princess in Equestria.

36:55.171 --> 36:57.537
Sunset Shimmer...

37:00.218 --> 37:02.334
Never mind.
It's not important.

37:06.683 --> 37:09.766
No, I have to be able
to do this.

37:10.019 --> 37:11.680
I have to.

37:13.648 --> 37:16.560
- ( music playing )
- Hey, hey, listen

37:16.818 --> 37:20.276
We've got a message
for you

37:20.530 --> 37:23.488
We're not all alike

37:23.742 --> 37:27.451
But our friendship is true

37:27.704 --> 37:30.821
Yeah, we're really different

37:31.082 --> 37:34.791
But we still get along

37:35.044 --> 37:36.830
So, hey, he!’

37:37.088 --> 37:41.172
Listen to our song

37:41.426 --> 37:45.044
You may think you're in control

37:45.305 --> 37:48.843
But we're here
to prove you wrong

37:49.100 --> 37:52.388
With the friendship
of our music

37:52.645 --> 37:56.058
With the power of our song

37:56.316 --> 38:00.229
Gonna stomp our feet,
clap our hands

38:00.487 --> 38:03.149
With our magical friendship

38:03.406 --> 38:07.490
Gonna stop your evil plan.

38:14.083 --> 38:15.948
Eh, that sounded
way better

38:16.211 --> 38:18.702
than the last five times
you played it.

38:18.963 --> 38:20.919
- ( chuckles )
- Nope.

38:22.383 --> 38:24.419
I think it's pretty obvious

38:24.677 --> 38:26.508
what's going wrong
with this counterspell.

38:26.763 --> 38:30.255
You're turning what should be the chorus
into a five-minute guitar solo?

38:30.517 --> 38:32.849
I have to pick up
the slack somehow.

38:33.102 --> 38:34.433
Are you guys even trying?

38:34.687 --> 38:35.893
I'm trying-

38:36.147 --> 38:37.933
It's fine.
I'll be fine.

38:38.191 --> 38:39.681
One more time from the top.

38:41.611 --> 38:43.943
Or perhaps we could take
a short break--

38:44.197 --> 38:46.904
try on some of the wardrobe choices
I put together.

38:47.158 --> 38:49.319
I'm particularly fond
of this one.

38:51.079 --> 38:53.741
Of course we could always go
with something a bit more modern.

38:53.998 --> 38:56.364
We're trying to
save our school here.

38:56.626 --> 38:57.911
Enough with the costumes.

38:58.169 --> 39:00.581
You can never have
enough costumes.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.921
She just wants
to make things fun.

39:03.174 --> 39:05.586
Isn't that what being
in a band is supposed to be?

39:06.845 --> 39:08.426
You don't have time
for any of this.

39:08.680 --> 39:12.093
You're supposed to check in at the
battle of the bands in 15 minutes.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.261
- ( all gasp)
- Oh, no!

39:14.519 --> 39:16.350
But-- but it's not ready.

39:16.604 --> 39:19.061
If we play the counterspell
in the first round and it doesn't work,

39:19.315 --> 39:20.600
the Sirens will know
what we're up to

39:20.859 --> 39:22.474
and make sure we don't
get a chance to play it again.

39:25.196 --> 39:27.482
Then we'll have to
buy ourselves some time

39:27.740 --> 39:28.946
so you can keep
working on it.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.065
And how do you propose
we do that?

39:31.327 --> 39:33.864
We compete in the battle
of the bands for real.

39:34.122 --> 39:37.364
I take over lead vocals again
and we stay alive until the finals.

39:37.625 --> 39:39.115
We unleash
the counterspell then.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.743
You'll have figured it out
by the finals, right?

39:42.005 --> 39:43.541
Of course she will.

39:43.798 --> 39:46.084
Twilight Spark|e's never met
a problem she couldn't solve.

39:46.342 --> 39:48.958
— Right, Twilight?
— Right.

39:49.220 --> 39:52.053
Then let's go win us
a battle of the bands.

40:03.026 --> 40:04.482
Welcome to the first ever

40:04.736 --> 40:06.897
Canterlot High School
battle of the bands.

40:07.155 --> 40:09.817
I believe I speak
for everyone when I say

40:10.074 --> 40:12.030
it is by far
the greatest thing

40:12.285 --> 40:14.651
we have ever done
here at this school.

40:14.913 --> 40:16.198
( cheering )

40:18.917 --> 40:21.659
We are so glad
our three newest students

40:21.920 --> 40:23.660
encouraged us
to turn this event

40:23.922 --> 40:25.958
into something exciting.

40:26.215 --> 40:28.627
But as this is now
a competition,

40:28.885 --> 40:30.876
we can only choose
one winner.

40:31.137 --> 40:33.503
Who is it going to be?

40:33.765 --> 40:35.301
( chatter)

40:45.234 --> 40:46.519
You feel that, girls?

40:46.778 --> 40:49.064
Our true power
is being restored.

40:49.322 --> 40:50.687
(laughing)

40:54.494 --> 40:55.904
Adagio:
And that's before

40:56.162 --> 40:58.403
we've tapped into
the strongest magic here.

40:58.665 --> 41:01.532
But the Rainb|ossoms--
or whatever they're called--

41:01.793 --> 41:03.499
aren't under our spell.

41:03.753 --> 41:06.620
How exactly are we supposed
to get to their magic?

41:06.881 --> 41:08.837
The Rainbooms
are just as capable

41:09.092 --> 41:11.003
of falling apart
as anyone else.

41:11.260 --> 41:14.673
They just need a little push
in the wrong direction.

41:14.931 --> 41:17.013
I have a feeling
everyone here

41:17.266 --> 41:20.053
is going to be lining up
to give them a shove.

41:22.021 --> 41:23.852
( beatboxing )

41:27.652 --> 41:30.519
Oh, yeah. Snips and Snails
in the house, yo.

41:30.780 --> 41:33.317
They call me M. C. Ships
and it ain't no lie

41:33.574 --> 41:35.656
My favorite food
is like pumpkin pie

41:35.910 --> 41:38.196
I 'm D.J. Snazzy Snails,
I like whales

41:38.454 --> 41:40.740
When I go to the beach,
I always bring my pail

41:40.999 --> 41:43.115
( beatboxing )

41:43.376 --> 41:45.492
Everybody knows
my favorite color is orange

41:45.753 --> 41:48.620
My rhymes are so fly,
they're better than, um...

41:48.881 --> 41:50.246
Than an orange, yo

41:50.508 --> 41:52.419
- Yeah, represent
- Yeah

41:52.677 --> 41:54.963
( beatboxing )

41:58.016 --> 41:59.426
What do we--
what do we do now?

41:59.684 --> 42:01.424
Get off the stage,
I'd like to leave right now.

42:01.686 --> 42:03.677
( beatboxing )

42:04.731 --> 42:06.062
Bam. That just happened.

42:06.315 --> 42:09.182
- Yeah, we out.
- Snip and Snails outta here.

42:10.236 --> 42:11.851
( feedback )

42:14.073 --> 42:15.813
Please do not
drop the microphones.

42:16.075 --> 42:18.316
- Yeah.
- Bam.

42:18.578 --> 42:22.070
In your face, Rainbooms.

42:22.331 --> 42:23.286
At least we know one group

42:23.541 --> 42:25.748
who won't stand in the way
of us getting to the finals.

42:26.002 --> 42:27.617
Let's get ready to rock.

42:27.879 --> 42:29.244
Wait,
where's Rarity?

42:29.505 --> 42:33.043
Ooh, here. I'm here.
( panting )

42:41.267 --> 42:43.223
We will be performing
in front of an audience.

42:43.478 --> 42:46.220
I'm not going to wear
something fabulous? Hmm.

42:46.481 --> 42:48.392
( groans)

42:49.734 --> 42:51.690
( chatter)

42:53.988 --> 42:56.479
Remember, we have to be
good enough to make it through,

42:56.741 --> 42:59.653
but not so good we let the Sirens
see the magic within us.

42:59.911 --> 43:01.947
They could realize we plan
to use it against them.

43:02.205 --> 43:04.116
Got it.
Be cool enough to win,

43:04.373 --> 43:06.409
but not so cool
that we end up showing off

43:06.667 --> 43:08.623
the whole ears and tails
and rainbows thing.

43:08.878 --> 43:12.370
So about 20% less cool.

43:12.632 --> 43:15.465
- One, two.
- We just got the day

43:15.718 --> 43:17.458
To get ready

43:17.720 --> 43:20.382
And there's only
so much time to lose

43:20.640 --> 43:24.258
Because tonight, yeah,
we're here to party

43:24.519 --> 43:27.181
So let's think of
something fun to do

43:28.731 --> 43:31.973
We don't know
what's gonna happen

43:32.235 --> 43:35.443
We just know
it's gonna feel right

43:35.696 --> 43:37.027
All our friends are here

43:37.281 --> 43:41.945
And it's time
to ignite the lights

43:42.203 --> 43:45.821
Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight

43:46.082 --> 43:48.619
Shake your tail,
shake your tail

43:48.876 --> 43:52.789
Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight

43:53.047 --> 43:55.584
Shake your tail,
shake your tail...

43:55.842 --> 43:58.083
So what you didn't get it
right the first time?

43:58.344 --> 43:59.379
Boﬁng.

43:59.637 --> 44:02.379
Laugh it off,
no one said it is a crime

44:02.640 --> 44:06.178
Do your thing,
you know you're an original

44:06.435 --> 44:09.347
Your ideas are so funny
that they're criminal

44:09.605 --> 44:12.096
- Ohh, ahh
- ( coughing )

44:12.358 --> 44:15.646
We've just got the day
to get ready

44:15.903 --> 44:18.565
And there's only
so much time to lose

44:18.823 --> 44:22.315
Because tonight, yeah,
we're here to party

44:22.577 --> 44:23.942
So let's think of
something fun to do

44:24.203 --> 44:26.785
- ( chuckling)
- Awesome.

44:27.039 --> 44:28.370
We don't know

44:28.624 --> 44:30.285
What's gonna happen

44:30.543 --> 44:33.660
We just know
it's gonna feel right

44:33.921 --> 44:35.457
All our friends are here

44:35.715 --> 44:40.209
And it's time
to ignite the lights

44:40.469 --> 44:44.007
Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight

44:44.265 --> 44:47.177
Shake your tail,
shake your tail

44:47.435 --> 44:50.848
Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight

44:51.105 --> 44:53.812
Shake your tail,
shake your tail

44:54.066 --> 44:57.229
Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight

44:57.486 --> 45:01.024
- Shake your tail, shake your tail
- (gasps)

45:01.282 --> 45:04.194
Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight

45:04.452 --> 45:07.364
Shake your tail,
shake your tail

45:07.622 --> 45:10.614
Shake your tail 'cause we're here
to have a party tonight.

45:10.875 --> 45:12.536
(crying)

45:12.793 --> 45:14.749
(applause)

45:17.256 --> 45:19.121
Ruined.

45:19.383 --> 45:21.089
Absolutely ruined.

45:21.344 --> 45:24.086
Rarity, were you trying
to make us lose out there?

45:24.347 --> 45:26.133
What--
this was not my fault.

45:26.390 --> 45:28.597
This was an act of sabotage.

45:28.851 --> 45:31.012
Yeah, well, whoever did this
couldn't have done this

45:31.270 --> 45:34.603
if you didn't insist
on dressing |ike-- like this.

45:34.857 --> 45:36.222
We need to sound good.

45:36.484 --> 45:38.975
Is there some reason
that concept seems to escape you?

45:39.237 --> 45:42.104
And what was
with the confetti, Pinkie Pie?

45:42.365 --> 45:45.357
How am I supposed to shred
if there's paper stuck in my frets?

45:45.618 --> 45:48.109
- It was pretty distracting.
- Ah!

45:48.371 --> 45:50.828
Says the girl who was running
from a light the whole time.

45:51.082 --> 45:52.197
A light!

45:52.458 --> 45:54.073
You still sounded
much better

45:54.335 --> 45:55.575
than most
of the other bands.

45:55.836 --> 45:57.372
I'm sure you'll make it
to the next round.

45:57.630 --> 46:01.623
But it won't matter if you don't
have that counterspell ready.

46:01.884 --> 46:04.500
You all find a place to practice
where the Sirens can't hear you,

46:04.762 --> 46:07.003
I'll keep an eye on things
around here.

46:15.564 --> 46:17.270
I don't think we should
use a classroom.

46:21.112 --> 46:24.275
We really need to stop bumping
into each other like this.

46:25.574 --> 46:27.110
Uh, you guys
hear something?

46:27.368 --> 46:28.699
- Uh-uh.
- Uh, no.

46:28.953 --> 46:31.410
I said we have to stop--

46:31.664 --> 46:33.950
There it is again.
So annoying.

46:34.208 --> 46:36.039
Why are you
acting like this?

46:36.294 --> 46:37.830
I thought
we were friends.

46:38.087 --> 46:40.123
Yeah, and then you decide
to come back here

46:40.381 --> 46:42.167
just so you can beat me
in the battle of the bands.

46:42.425 --> 46:45.007
I want this, Twilight,
and you're trying to take it from me.

46:45.261 --> 46:47.047
Some friend.

46:47.305 --> 46:48.294
That's not why--

46:48.556 --> 46:49.966
Come on, Twilight.
We've got things to do.

46:50.224 --> 46:51.805
You really think
you're gonna help them?

46:52.059 --> 46:54.516
I bet you have no idea
what you're even doing.

46:58.774 --> 47:00.730
( snickers )
Tears already?

47:00.985 --> 47:02.850
This is only
the first round.

47:03.112 --> 47:05.899
(laughing)

47:06.157 --> 47:07.818
Principal Celestia:
The next band to take the stage

47:08.075 --> 47:10.191
will be Trixie
and the Illusions.

47:10.453 --> 47:14.196
Better head back.
We're supposed to go on after Trixie.

47:19.253 --> 47:21.164
You're never gonna
get away with this.

47:21.422 --> 47:23.538
Why, because you didn't?

47:25.259 --> 47:28.467
Oh, we know all about you,
Sunset Shimmer.

47:28.721 --> 47:31.007
You've got quite
the reputation at Canterlot High.

47:31.265 --> 47:33.677
I've changed.
I'm in a much better place now.

47:33.934 --> 47:36.676
Waiting in the wings
while your friends have all the fun?

47:36.937 --> 47:40.020
Oh, yes,
you girls are so tight.

47:40.274 --> 47:43.357
And yet they didn't ask you
to be in the band?

47:43.611 --> 47:46.023
Probably afraid no one
would want to see them play

47:46.280 --> 47:48.191
if she was
in the group.

47:48.449 --> 47:49.529
Too bad.

47:49.784 --> 47:50.990
So sad.

47:51.243 --> 47:52.653
Adagio:
If it's any consolation,

47:52.912 --> 47:55.119
no one is going to
remember you at all

47:55.373 --> 47:57.159
by the time
we're done.

48:05.966 --> 48:08.048
Remember, girls,
we want to save the good stuff

48:08.302 --> 48:10.793
for when our full power
has been restored.

48:13.182 --> 48:15.548
- ( music playing )
- Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

48:15.810 --> 48:17.721
You didn't know
that you fell

48:17.978 --> 48:20.094
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

48:20.356 --> 48:22.267
Now that you're
under our spell

48:22.525 --> 48:24.937
Blindsided by the beat

48:25.194 --> 48:27.185
Clapping your hands,
stomping your feet

48:27.446 --> 48:29.402
You didn't know
that you fell

48:29.657 --> 48:31.443
Oh

48:31.700 --> 48:34.066
Now you've fallen
under our spell

48:34.328 --> 48:36.410
Oh

48:36.664 --> 48:39.076
We've got the music,
makes you move it

48:39.333 --> 48:41.289
Got the song
that makes you lose it

48:41.544 --> 48:43.751
We say, "Jump,"
you say, "How high?"

48:44.004 --> 48:45.869
Put your hands up
to the sky

48:46.132 --> 48:48.168
We've got the music,
makes you move it

48:48.426 --> 48:50.587
Got the song
that makes you lose it

48:50.845 --> 48:52.927
We say, "Jump,"
you say, "How high?"

48:53.180 --> 48:55.091
Put your hands up
to the sky

48:55.349 --> 48:57.089
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

48:57.351 --> 48:59.467
You didn't know
that you fell

48:59.728 --> 49:01.639
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

49:01.897 --> 49:03.933
Now that you're
under our spell

49:04.191 --> 49:06.398
Listen to the sound
of my voice

49:06.652 --> 49:08.233
Oh

49:08.487 --> 49:11.149
Soon you'll find
you don't have a choice

49:11.407 --> 49:12.897
Oh

49:13.159 --> 49:15.775
Captured in the web
of my song

49:16.036 --> 49:17.401
Oh

49:17.663 --> 49:20.700
Soon you'll all
be singing along

49:20.958 --> 49:22.198
Oh

49:22.460 --> 49:25.042
We've got the music,
makes you move it

49:25.296 --> 49:27.332
Got the song
that makes you lose it

49:27.590 --> 49:29.706
We say, "Jump,"
you say, "How high?"

49:29.967 --> 49:31.958
Put your hands up
to the sky

49:32.219 --> 49:34.426
We've got the music,
makes you move it

49:34.680 --> 49:36.671
Got the song
that makes you lose it

49:36.932 --> 49:38.888
We say, "Jump,"
you say, "How high?"

49:39.143 --> 49:41.259
Put your hands up
to the sky

49:41.520 --> 49:43.101
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

49:43.355 --> 49:45.471
You didn't know
that you fell

49:45.733 --> 49:47.644
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

49:47.902 --> 49:50.109
Now that you're
under our spell

49:50.362 --> 49:52.478
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

49:52.740 --> 49:54.947
You didn't know
that you fell

49:55.201 --> 49:56.987
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

49:57.244 --> 50:00.486
Now that you're
under our spell.

50:00.748 --> 50:02.659
( cackling )

50:15.221 --> 50:17.507
This is it, last round
and you're in the finals.

50:17.765 --> 50:21.053
Unless you think the counterspell
is ready to be played now.

50:22.603 --> 50:25.185
Don't worry, Twilight,
finals aren't until tonight.

50:25.439 --> 50:26.599
We'll get in a little
more practice

50:26.857 --> 50:28.222
before we're
supposed to hit the stage.

50:28.484 --> 50:30.896
- We won't let you down.
- All: Yeah.

50:31.153 --> 50:33.610
You won't let me down.

50:33.864 --> 50:36.230
F|uttershy:
Um, I was just wondering,

50:36.492 --> 50:39.575
we haven't played any
of my songs yet and--

50:39.828 --> 50:40.943
It's the semifinals.

50:41.205 --> 50:42.445
We've gotta do
"Awesome as I Wanna Be."

50:42.706 --> 50:45.448
I don't know why I even asked.

50:45.709 --> 50:47.370
got tricks
up my sleeve

50:47.628 --> 50:53.589
See me dominate 'cause
I'm powerful and great.

50:55.469 --> 50:58.427
Oh! Fantastic.

51:00.641 --> 51:04.975
You're never gonna top
that performance, "Raingoons."

51:05.229 --> 51:06.560
You shouldn't
be allowed to

51:06.814 --> 51:09.430
when you have such
a big advantage over the rest of us.

51:09.692 --> 51:11.478
My superior guitar playing

51:11.735 --> 51:13.771
and off-the-charts
awesome singing voice?

51:14.029 --> 51:15.815
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

51:16.073 --> 51:17.529
I mean her.

51:17.783 --> 51:20.490
If you were really all that,
Rainbow Dash,

51:20.744 --> 51:23.235
you wouldn't have needed
to bring in some magical ringer

51:23.497 --> 51:24.703
to have half a chance.

51:24.957 --> 51:26.663
Everyone's talking about it.

51:26.917 --> 51:28.453
Ha! Please.

51:28.711 --> 51:30.326
I could win this thing
as a solo act

51:30.588 --> 51:33.125
and everybody knows it.

51:33.382 --> 51:34.838
Sure, you could.

51:37.386 --> 51:38.751
(coughing)

51:40.306 --> 51:42.547
She's gone!

51:42.808 --> 51:44.844
Oh, wait.
There she is.

51:46.103 --> 51:48.719
Principal Celestia:
Next up, the Rainbooms.

51:51.233 --> 51:53.895
- Knock ‘em dead, Rainbooms.
- I'll be here.

51:54.153 --> 51:56.860
Just watching.

52:00.075 --> 52:05.365
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
- Awesome as I wanna be

52:05.623 --> 52:09.582
Hey, hey: hey’
hey, hey, he!’

52:09.835 --> 52:11.200
Awesome as I wanna be

52:11.462 --> 52:13.874
First you see me
riding on a sonic boom

52:14.131 --> 52:16.543
Got my guitar
shredding up my latest tune

52:16.800 --> 52:19.132
There is nothing
you can do to beat me

52:19.386 --> 52:21.843
I'm so good
that you can't defeat me

52:22.097 --> 52:24.713
Yeah, I'm awesome,
take caution

52:24.975 --> 52:27.557
Watch out for me,
I'm awesome as I wanna be

52:27.811 --> 52:30.348
Yeah, I'm awesome,
take caution

52:30.606 --> 52:33.143
Watch out for me,
I'm as awesome as I wanna be

52:33.400 --> 52:37.689
Hey, hey: hey’
hey, hey, he!’

52:37.946 --> 52:42.485
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey.

52:50.709 --> 52:52.415
( screams )

53:01.136 --> 53:03.627
Now that's the bad girl
we love to hate.

53:03.889 --> 53:06.346
- ( cheering )
- I knew she was still trouble.

53:06.600 --> 53:09.342
Boy:
The real Sunset Shimmer is back.

53:10.729 --> 53:12.685
No, it isn't like that.

53:16.527 --> 53:18.358
What was that?

53:18.612 --> 53:19.977
You were showing them
your magic.

53:20.239 --> 53:21.775
I didn't know
what else to do.

53:22.032 --> 53:24.444
Close the curtains.
Unplug her amp.

53:24.702 --> 53:26.317
Give us a chance to deal
with the situation.

53:26.578 --> 53:28.534
I'm sorry.
Ijust wanted to help.

53:28.789 --> 53:30.370
Yeah, well, you didn't.

53:30.624 --> 53:33.457
None of this would've happened
if you weren't trying to show off.

53:33.711 --> 53:34.871
As usual.

53:35.129 --> 53:37.336
Good show, "Rainbrooms."

53:37.589 --> 53:39.921
I especially like the part
where Sunset Shimmer,

53:40.175 --> 53:41.790
in a fit ofjealous rage,

53:42.052 --> 53:45.260
knocked out Rainbow Dash
mid guitar solo.

53:45.514 --> 53:47.721
It wasn't a fit
ofjealous rage.

53:50.602 --> 53:52.263
If you say so.

53:52.521 --> 53:55.308
Ooh, looks like
they've already decided

53:55.566 --> 53:57.102
who'll be moving on
to the finals.

53:57.359 --> 54:00.442
I'm guessing it wasn't
too difficult a decision.

54:01.613 --> 54:03.569
(vocalizing )

54:07.453 --> 54:10.320
- Huh?
- Rarity: What can we do?

54:10.581 --> 54:12.913
There isn't gonna be another
opportunity for us to play.

54:13.167 --> 54:16.659
And I had the most gorgeous
outfit for the finals.

54:16.920 --> 54:19.753
Yup, 'cause that's
he real tragedy here, Rarity.

54:20.007 --> 54:21.497
That you won't
get to play dress-up.

54:21.759 --> 54:23.750
You know perfectly well
that is not what I meant.

54:24.011 --> 54:25.751
You guys wanna
keep it down?

54:26.013 --> 54:27.128
They're about to
announce who's moving on.

54:27.389 --> 54:28.378
Who are you kidding?

54:28.640 --> 54:30.596
You know it isn't
gonna be us.

54:33.687 --> 54:37.054
The band that will be joining
the Dazzlings in tonight's finals...

54:37.316 --> 54:39.181
the Rainbooms.

54:39.443 --> 54:40.899
-What?!
—All: Huh?

54:41.153 --> 54:43.235
Did they just say
"The Rainbooms"?

54:44.281 --> 54:46.488
This isn't over.

54:48.535 --> 54:50.491
Congratulations, girls.

54:50.746 --> 54:52.486
You deserve it.

54:52.748 --> 54:55.160
Seriously?
We didn't even finish our--

54:57.336 --> 55:00.328
See you at tonight's
big show, Rainbooms.

55:00.589 --> 55:03.797
We are really
looking forward to it.

55:04.051 --> 55:06.383
Yeah, well,
not as much as we are.

55:06.637 --> 55:08.628
( crowd booing, jeering )

55:08.889 --> 55:11.255
This never should have been you,
Rainbooms.

55:23.737 --> 55:25.477
This is a travesty.

55:25.739 --> 55:27.479
A travesty!

55:27.741 --> 55:29.072
It really is.

55:29.326 --> 55:31.567
The Rainbooms don't deserve
to be in the finals.

55:31.829 --> 55:34.662
Not when your band
was so much better in the semis.

55:34.915 --> 55:36.997
And wanted it
so much more.

55:37.251 --> 55:39.412
Alas, this is the way
it's going to be.

55:39.670 --> 55:41.752
Dazzlings
versus Rainbooms.

55:42.005 --> 55:44.246
Unless, of course, the Rainbooms
don't manage to make it to their set

55:44.508 --> 55:46.499
were held up
for some reason.

55:46.760 --> 55:48.625
Hmm?
('a“9hing)

55:56.854 --> 55:59.470
Check one, two.
Testing. Testing.

56:03.277 --> 56:05.142
- Testing.
- ( feedback )

56:08.782 --> 56:10.613
This doesn't
make any sense.

56:10.868 --> 56:12.199
We were awful.

56:12.452 --> 56:14.488
Doesn't anybody else
think it's strange

56:14.746 --> 56:16.953
that we're the ones
that made it to the finals?

56:17.207 --> 56:19.994
Very strange.

56:20.252 --> 56:21.992
What are you doing here,
Trixie?

56:22.254 --> 56:25.087
Pretty sure the losers are supposed
to be up there in the cheap seats.

56:25.340 --> 56:27.501
The great and powerful Trixie

56:27.759 --> 56:30.125
is the most talented girl
at Canterlot High.

56:30.387 --> 56:33.003
It is I who deserve to be
in the finals.

56:33.265 --> 56:35.677
And I will not be denied.

56:35.934 --> 56:38.676
(all scream )

56:47.195 --> 56:48.526
( cackling )

56:50.407 --> 56:52.648
See you never.

56:59.207 --> 57:01.414
Told you someone
would give them a shove.

57:01.668 --> 57:03.829
She didn't shove them,
she pulled the lever.

57:04.087 --> 57:06.703
Oh, go back to sleep,
Sonata.

57:08.634 --> 57:12.218
You better believe
I've got tricks up my sleeve

57:12.471 --> 57:16.430
And I captivate 'cause
I'm powerful and great

57:18.602 --> 57:22.561
You'd better believe
I've got tricks up my sleeve

57:22.814 --> 57:27.808
See me dominate 'cause
I'm powerful and great...

57:33.742 --> 57:35.403
App|ejack:
Give it up, Rainbow Dash.

57:35.661 --> 57:38.949
You've been trying at this for hours.
It's not gonna open.

57:41.124 --> 57:43.365
Maybe it doesn't even matter
that we're trapped down here.

57:43.627 --> 57:45.834
I don't think the counterspell
would've worked anyway.

57:46.088 --> 57:47.703
‘Course it would've worked,
Twilight.

57:47.965 --> 57:50.707
Assuming a certain band member
didn't try to hog the spotlight

57:50.968 --> 57:52.333
the whole time
we were trying to play it.

57:52.594 --> 57:54.550
Hey, if you want
to tell Twilight

57:54.805 --> 57:56.045
she's getting
a little too caught up

57:56.306 --> 57:57.762
trying to be the new leader of this
band,

57:58.016 --> 58:00.132
you don't have to be
all cryptic about it.

58:00.394 --> 58:04.137
She was talking about you,
Rainbow Dash.

58:04.398 --> 58:05.478
Me?!

58:05.732 --> 58:07.222
I'm just trying
to make sure my band

58:07.484 --> 58:09.190
rocks as hard
as it needs to.

58:09.444 --> 58:11.309
All:
Our band!

58:11.571 --> 58:13.186
But why wasn't it working?

58:13.448 --> 58:14.688
I should know what to do.

58:14.950 --> 58:16.486
How can I not know
what to do?

58:16.743 --> 58:18.404
How could I
have failed like this?

58:18.662 --> 58:20.903
It might've been your idea
to start a band,

58:21.164 --> 58:23.655
but it's not just your band,
Rainbow Dash.

58:23.917 --> 58:25.782
I'm the one who writes
all the songs.

58:26.044 --> 58:29.207
I write songs.
You just never let us play any of them.

58:29.464 --> 58:32.080
I had the most perfect
outfits for us to wear.

58:32.342 --> 58:34.003
Again with the costumes.

58:34.261 --> 58:35.751
No one cares
what we're wearing.

58:36.013 --> 58:37.549
I care, Applejack.

58:37.806 --> 58:41.094
So sorry if I enjoy trying to make
a creative contribution to the band.

58:41.351 --> 58:43.717
Hey, anybody here
remember fun?!

58:43.979 --> 58:45.264
I'll give you a hint--

58:45.522 --> 58:48.685
it's the exact opposite
of being in the Rainbooms!

58:48.942 --> 58:51.684
I wish I never asked
any of you to be in my band.

58:51.945 --> 58:56.314
- I wish I never agreed to be in it!
- Both: Me neither.

58:56.575 --> 58:58.531
(overlapping yelling )

59:09.671 --> 59:11.286
Yeah, yeah

59:11.548 --> 59:15.291
Better believe
I've got tricks up my sleeve

59:15.552 --> 59:21.513
See me dominate 'cause
I'm powerful and great.

59:23.977 --> 59:25.842
( crowd cheering )

59:31.359 --> 59:33.020
Try to top that.

59:33.278 --> 59:36.270
Oh, gosh,
I don't know if we can.

59:36.531 --> 59:38.863
( laughs)

59:48.251 --> 59:49.991
( music playing )

59:57.677 --> 59:59.633
(vocalizing )

01:00:15.487 --> 01:00:17.443
(overlapping yelling
conﬁnues)

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:22.156
Stop!
You have to stop!

01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:24.651
This is what
they've been after all along.

01:00:24.913 --> 01:00:27.404
They're feeding off
of the magic inside you.

01:00:27.666 --> 01:00:29.657
How can they
be using our magic?

01:00:29.918 --> 01:00:31.328
It's the magic
of friendship.

01:00:33.255 --> 01:00:35.086
Ever since you started
this band,

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:37.205
you've been letting
little things get to you.

01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:40.379
I never said anything 'cause
I didn't feel like it was my place.

01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:44.050
Not when I was so new to this
whole friendship thing.

01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:46.343
I still have a lot to learn.

01:00:46.601 --> 01:00:48.387
But I do know that
if you don't work out

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:50.886
even the smallest problems
right at the start,

01:00:51.148 --> 01:00:54.231
the magic of friendship
can be turned into something else.

01:00:55.944 --> 01:00:57.809
I can't believe
all this tension was happening

01:00:58.071 --> 01:01:00.062
right under my nose
and I didn't realize it.

01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:02.314
I'm supposed to be the one
with all the answers.

01:01:02.576 --> 01:01:06.239
And all I've done
since I got here is let you down.

01:01:07.914 --> 01:01:10.496
I don't think anyone
is supposed to have all the answers.

01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:14.083
But you can count
on your friends to help you find them.

01:01:16.214 --> 01:01:17.624
I think you already have.

01:01:17.883 --> 01:01:19.965
Come on, we need to
get out of here.

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:23.585
(all grunting)

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:25.712
( knocks )

01:01:25.974 --> 01:01:27.180
Spike!

01:01:29.436 --> 01:01:31.267
Sorry I took so long.

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:32.931
I had to find somebody who wasn't
under the Sirens‘ spell

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:34.350
to help me get you out.

01:01:36.151 --> 01:01:38.233
Why isn't she
under their spell?

01:01:38.486 --> 01:01:39.771
Never takes off
herheadphones.

01:01:41.323 --> 01:01:42.813
Come on, y'all.

01:01:43.074 --> 01:01:45.235
Time to prove we've still got the magic
of friendship inside us.

01:01:45.493 --> 01:01:47.233
And there's only
one way to do it.

01:01:47.495 --> 01:01:49.110
We're getting the band
back together?

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:51.203
We're getting
our band back together.

01:01:51.458 --> 01:01:54.165
- Whee!
- Oh, which version of the counterspell

01:01:54.419 --> 01:01:55.534
are we going to play?

01:01:55.795 --> 01:01:57.831
I don't think it matters
what song we play

01:01:58.089 --> 01:02:01.206
as long as we play it
together as friends.

01:02:01.468 --> 01:02:02.583
I know just the song.

01:02:04.179 --> 01:02:06.170
F|uttershy's written
a really great one.

01:02:07.641 --> 01:02:09.381
We're about to
save the world here.

01:02:09.643 --> 01:02:12.555
Personally,
I think we should do it in style.

01:02:12.812 --> 01:02:15.599
- Rarity?
- I thought you'd never ask.

01:02:17.525 --> 01:02:19.481
(vocalizing )

01:02:27.202 --> 01:02:31.411
Welcome to the show

01:02:31.665 --> 01:02:36.409
We're here
to let you know

01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:40.709
Our time is now

01:02:40.966 --> 01:02:43.924
Your time is running out

01:02:44.177 --> 01:02:46.133
(vocalizing )

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:52.014
How are we supposed
to play over them from up here?

01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:53.429
( horn honks)

01:02:54.729 --> 01:02:56.594
(honks)

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:04.895
( cheering )

01:03:05.156 --> 01:03:07.693
Feel the wave of sound

01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:10.317
As it crashes down

01:03:10.578 --> 01:03:12.569
You can't turn away

01:03:12.831 --> 01:03:15.413
We'll make you wanna stay

01:03:15.667 --> 01:03:18.374
We will be adored

01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:20.539
Tell us that you want us

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:23.413
We won't be ignored

01:03:23.675 --> 01:03:25.666
It's time for our reward

01:03:25.927 --> 01:03:28.009
Now you need us

01:03:28.263 --> 01:03:30.675
Come and meet us

01:03:30.932 --> 01:03:35.676
Nothing can stop us now

01:03:35.937 --> 01:03:38.553
- ( music playing )
- Oh, whoa

01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:40.976
I've got the music in me

01:03:41.234 --> 01:03:43.395
Oh, whoa

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:47.813
Don't need
to hear a crowd

01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:50.781
Cheering out my name

01:03:51.036 --> 01:03:55.029
I didn't come here
seeking infamy or fame

01:03:55.290 --> 01:03:57.702
The one and only thing

01:03:57.959 --> 01:03:59.574
That I am here to bring

01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:01.576
Is music,
is the music

01:04:01.838 --> 01:04:04.045
Is the music
in my soul

01:04:04.299 --> 01:04:05.505
Gonna break out

01:04:05.759 --> 01:04:09.001
Set myself free, yeah

01:04:09.262 --> 01:04:10.877
Let it all go, go

01:04:11.139 --> 01:04:13.505
Just let it be, yeah

01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:16.133
Find the music
in your heart

01:04:16.394 --> 01:04:18.385
Let the music
make you start

01:04:18.646 --> 01:04:23.060
To set yourself apart

01:04:23.318 --> 01:04:27.061
So the Rainbooms want to turn this
into a real battle of the bands?

01:04:27.322 --> 01:04:28.937
Then let's battle.

01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:31.030
What we have in store

01:04:31.284 --> 01:04:33.741
All we want and more

01:04:33.995 --> 01:04:35.951
We will break on through

01:04:36.206 --> 01:04:39.289
Now it's time
to finish you

01:05:17.997 --> 01:05:20.613
Oh, oh...

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:24.826
(vocalizing )

01:05:55.243 --> 01:05:57.905
Sunset Shimmer,
we need you.

01:06:07.213 --> 01:06:09.078
( music playing )

01:06:10.925 --> 01:06:14.258
You're never gonna
bring me down

01:06:14.512 --> 01:06:17.754
You're never gonna
break this part of me

01:06:18.016 --> 01:06:21.474
My friends are here
to bring me around

01:06:21.728 --> 01:06:25.141
Not just singing
for popularity

01:06:25.398 --> 01:06:27.263
We're here
to let you know

01:06:27.525 --> 01:06:28.935
That we won't let it go

01:06:29.194 --> 01:06:32.061
Our music is a bomb
and it's about to blow

01:06:32.322 --> 01:06:33.983
And you can try to fight

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:38.779
But we have got the light
of friendship on our side

01:06:39.037 --> 01:06:41.824
Got the music
in our hearts

01:06:42.081 --> 01:06:45.414
We're here to blow
this thing apart

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:49.411
And together,
we will never

01:06:49.672 --> 01:06:52.755
Be afraid of the dark

01:06:53.009 --> 01:06:56.376
Here to sing our song
out loud

01:06:56.638 --> 01:06:59.801
Get you dancing
with the crowd

01:07:00.058 --> 01:07:05.303
As the music
of our friendship survives

01:07:05.563 --> 01:07:07.099
Survives

01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:10.315
Got the music
in our hearts

01:07:10.568 --> 01:07:13.935
We're here to blow
this thing apart

01:07:14.197 --> 01:07:17.610
And together,
we will never

01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:21.155
Be afraid of the dark

01:07:21.412 --> 01:07:24.745
Here to sing our song
out loud

01:07:24.999 --> 01:07:28.116
Get you dancing
with the crowd

01:07:28.378 --> 01:07:33.418
As the music
of our friendship survives

01:07:33.675 --> 01:07:39.215
Survives, survives

01:07:58.783 --> 01:08:01.650
(singing off-key )
We will be adored

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:03.651
Tell us that you want us

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:06.074
We won't be ignored

01:08:06.332 --> 01:08:09.950
- ( booing )
- It's time for our reward...

01:08:15.425 --> 01:08:18.337
Guess that explains why these were
so special to them.

01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:21.678
Without those pendants and the magic
you brought here from Equestria,

01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:24.263
they're just three
harmless teenage girls.

01:08:24.517 --> 01:08:28.055
Rainbooms rule!
That was amazing.

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:31.808
(giggling)

01:08:35.653 --> 01:08:37.734
You may have vanquished
the Dazzlings,

01:08:37.988 --> 01:08:41.197
but you will never have the amazing
showstopping ability

01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:44.067
of the great
and powerful Trixie.

01:08:45.662 --> 01:08:47.323
(coughing)

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.990
She's gone!

01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:54.501
Oh, wait.
There she is.

01:08:56.174 --> 01:08:59.086
( groans )
Trixie's okay.

01:08:59.344 --> 01:09:02.176
You know, Twilight is going back
to Equestria soon.

01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:03.840
The Rainbooms
could really use

01:09:04.098 --> 01:09:06.760
someone to help Fluttershy
on backup vocals.

01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:14.264
I also play guitar.

01:09:18.363 --> 01:09:19.819
We'll see.

01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:31.580
Sure wish
you could stay longer.

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:34.416
Me, too, but I have
responsibilities

01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:36.502
in Equestria
that I have to get back to.

01:09:36.756 --> 01:09:39.667
Its citizens need me.

01:09:39.926 --> 01:09:43.009
But now I can go through the portal
whenever I need to.

01:09:43.261 --> 01:09:46.880
This isn't good-bye,
it's just good-bye till next time.

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:49.803
- Ready?
- Ready.

01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:04.276
"Dear
Princess Twilight,

01:10:04.534 --> 01:10:07.947
missing you already
and hope you'll be back soon.

01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:11.446
Things are definitely looking up
for me here at Canterlot High,

01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:15.371
but I know I still have a lot
to learn about friendship.

01:10:15.628 --> 01:10:18.540
Hope you don't mind if I write to you
for advice when I need it.

01:10:18.798 --> 01:10:21.414
Your friend,
Sunset Shimmer."

01:10:21.676 --> 01:10:24.509
- You ready or what?
- Ready.

01:10:26.139 --> 01:10:27.925
One, two, three, four.

01:10:28.182 --> 01:10:30.138
( music playing )

01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:39.983
Once upon a time

01:10:40.236 --> 01:10:44.320
You came into my world
and made the stars align

01:10:45.867 --> 01:10:48.950
Now I can see the signs

01:10:49.203 --> 01:10:53.037
You pick me up
when I get down so I can shine

01:10:53.291 --> 01:10:57.250
Shine like rainbows

01:10:57.503 --> 01:11:02.668
Shine
like rainbows

01:11:02.925 --> 01:11:06.338
Friends,
you are in my life

01:11:06.596 --> 01:11:11.431
And you can count on me
to be there by your side

01:11:11.684 --> 01:11:15.142
And when the music
comes alive

01:11:15.396 --> 01:11:19.514
We sing our songs to
lift us up so we can shine

01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:23.268
And the sound
that we hear in our hearts

01:11:23.529 --> 01:11:28.068
Makes a crescendo

01:11:28.326 --> 01:11:31.864
And the light that ignites
in the dark

01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:36.364
It makes us all glow

01:11:36.626 --> 01:11:40.710
And shine like rainbows

01:11:40.963 --> 01:11:46.208
We shine like rainbows

01:11:46.469 --> 01:11:50.087
Together we stand

01:11:50.348 --> 01:11:56.093
As the rain
begins to fall

01:11:56.354 --> 01:11:59.061
And holding
our heads up high

01:11:59.315 --> 01:12:03.183
As the sun shines
through it all

01:12:03.444 --> 01:12:07.278
And the sound
that we hear in our hearts

01:12:07.532 --> 01:12:12.071
Makes a crescendo

01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:15.411
And the light
that ignites in the dark

01:12:15.665 --> 01:12:20.625
It makes us all glow

01:12:20.878 --> 01:12:24.746
And shine like rainbows

01:12:25.007 --> 01:12:29.171
We shine like rainbows

01:12:29.428 --> 01:12:33.421
Shine like rainbows

01:12:33.683 --> 01:12:37.926
We shine like rainbows

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:42.396
Shine like rainbows.

01:13:06.007 --> 01:13:08.168
No doubt about it, Spike.

01:13:08.426 --> 01:13:11.668
There's definitely something strange
going on at that school.
