01:13.607 --> 01:16.610
GIRL: Everybody asks
why I started at the end

01:16.610 --> 01:19.147
and worked back
to the beginning.

01:19.147 --> 01:20.548
The reason is simple.

01:20.548 --> 01:22.950
I couldn't understand
the beginning

01:22.950 --> 01:25.153
until I'd reached the end.

01:27.888 --> 01:30.491
There were too many
pieces of the puzzle missing.

01:30.491 --> 01:33.761
Too much she would never tell.

01:35.496 --> 01:40.234
I could sell these things.
People want to buy them.

01:40.234 --> 01:42.236
But I'd set all this
on fire first.

01:42.236 --> 01:44.238
She'd like that.

01:44.238 --> 01:46.307
That's what she would do.

01:46.307 --> 01:49.343
She'd make it just to burn it.

01:50.511 --> 01:52.413
I couldn't afford this one,

01:52.413 --> 01:55.048
but the beginning deserves
something special.

01:55.048 --> 01:58.085
But how do I show that nothing,

01:58.085 --> 02:01.255
not a taste, not a smell,

02:01.255 --> 02:03.357
not even the color of the sky

02:03.357 --> 02:05.526
has ever been
as clear and sharp

02:05.526 --> 02:08.395
as it was
when I belonged to her.

02:08.395 --> 02:10.531
I don't know how to express

02:10.531 --> 02:13.934
that being
with someone so dangerous

02:13.934 --> 02:17.338
was the last time
that I felt safe.

02:52.873 --> 02:56.744
The Santa Anas blew in hot
from the desert that fall.

02:56.744 --> 03:01.549
Only the oleanders thrived.

03:03.984 --> 03:07.721
Maybe the wind was the reason
my mother did what she did.

03:07.721 --> 03:10.190
If it was,
I wouldn't have known.

03:10.190 --> 03:13.261
I lived in her shadow then.

03:13.261 --> 03:15.329
She was

03:15.329 --> 03:18.632
the most beautiful woman
I'd ever seen.

03:18.632 --> 03:21.735
I know everybody thinks that
when they're small,

03:21.735 --> 03:23.371
but she was
the most beautiful woman

03:23.371 --> 03:26.974
most people had ever seen.

03:28.476 --> 03:31.245
He came into our lives
without warning.

03:31.245 --> 03:33.614
She ignored him at first.

03:33.614 --> 03:34.982
He wasn't her type.

03:34.982 --> 03:38.886
We laughed about him,
his persistence.

03:38.886 --> 03:41.355
"Never let a man
spend the night,"

03:41.355 --> 03:42.756
she said.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.958
"Never apologize,
never explain."

03:46.827 --> 03:48.796
She was breaking
all her rules...

03:48.796 --> 03:52.433
and it would change everything.

03:58.071 --> 04:01.241
What are you
doing up here?

04:01.241 --> 04:03.711
Come sit next to me.

04:03.711 --> 04:08.416
It's the best place
to feel the wind.

04:08.416 --> 04:11.519
I can feel it from here.

04:11.519 --> 04:13.821
No, you can't.

04:17.124 --> 04:20.494
It's okay.

04:25.132 --> 04:27.000
You should
get some sleep.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.002
I never sleep.

04:29.002 --> 04:30.538
I've been up here for hours.

04:30.538 --> 04:32.540
I had the most amazing idea

04:32.540 --> 04:36.410
for how to use my Polaroids
in the Newport show.

04:36.410 --> 04:38.546
I'm going to skip work today.

04:38.546 --> 04:41.382
Keep going until I finish.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.417
You're still coming
to Parents' Night,

04:43.417 --> 04:45.018
aren't you?

04:45.018 --> 04:47.020
Oh, God, I forgot.

04:49.390 --> 04:53.561
I made plans
to go to Greta's opening.

04:53.561 --> 04:55.963
All the other
parents go.

04:55.963 --> 05:00.300
What can they tell me about you
that I don't know already know?

05:01.201 --> 05:03.704
Time is up! Pencils down.

05:03.704 --> 05:07.408
Papers, please. Thank you.

05:07.408 --> 05:10.043
Thank you.

05:10.043 --> 05:12.713
Time, Astrid.

05:15.182 --> 05:17.418
Is your mother coming tonight?

05:17.418 --> 05:20.053
No.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.589
She has other plans.

05:21.589 --> 05:24.157
More important than
Parents' Night?

05:24.157 --> 05:25.659
She's an artist.

05:25.659 --> 05:29.096
She doesn't care about things
like Parents' Night.

05:29.096 --> 05:30.931
Right.

05:30.931 --> 05:36.069
Don't forget, you guys,
chapters 17 and 18 for tomorrow.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.171
Finished my mug shots.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.474
What do you think?

05:40.474 --> 05:43.043
They're great.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.012
No.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.514
You're not looking.

05:46.514 --> 05:49.550
You can't be an artist
if you don't see.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.685
Why do you think they're great?

06:00.160 --> 06:01.629
I don't know.

06:03.531 --> 06:05.833
They're lonely.

06:09.670 --> 06:12.272
It's me in the center.

06:12.272 --> 06:14.107
It's our secret.

06:14.107 --> 06:15.843
You can't tell anybody.

06:15.843 --> 06:17.377
I won't.

06:17.377 --> 06:21.114
I never
tell our secrets.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.319
WOMAN:
It's the deer-in-
the-headlights look.

06:26.319 --> 06:27.621
It's hilarious.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.389
MAN:
How long has this
been going on?

06:29.389 --> 06:30.791
Couple months.

06:30.791 --> 06:33.527
His wife will figure
it out sooner or later.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.429
Ah, she's an idiot.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.398
Cinema Scene.

06:39.667 --> 06:42.135
It's Barry Kolker
again.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.207
Tell him I was killed

06:47.207 --> 06:50.644
in a climbing accident
in the Himalayas.

06:50.644 --> 06:53.714
Barry, she's
still out of town.

07:09.396 --> 07:11.298
We don't have any eggs.

07:11.298 --> 07:14.768
We never
have any eggs.

07:18.806 --> 07:23.176
Barry can take us out
to breakfast.

07:23.176 --> 07:25.178
Barry spent the night?

07:25.178 --> 07:27.447
Yeah.

08:13.226 --> 08:16.129
I bet he's still out of town
on that assignment.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.497
I called the magazine.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.900
He got back three days ago.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.769
Well, he's probably working.

08:21.769 --> 08:23.336
He doesn't call
when he works.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.805
He doesn't call

08:24.805 --> 08:26.974
when he's getting what he wants
from somebody else.

08:46.927 --> 08:49.396
I don't think
we should do this.

08:49.396 --> 08:51.198
He'll get mad.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.466
I'll just say we were
in the neighborhood.

08:53.466 --> 08:57.270
He won't believe us.

10:18.485 --> 10:21.789
You're not my type.

10:27.560 --> 10:30.698
You're not my type.

10:43.677 --> 10:45.278
What happened?

10:45.278 --> 10:47.781
He has a date.

10:47.781 --> 10:52.385
He made love to me
and then said I had to leave

10:52.385 --> 10:54.654
because he has a date.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.404
You're under arrest for
the murder of Barry Kolker.

11:11.404 --> 11:13.040
They can't keep me!

11:13.040 --> 11:15.675
I'll be back in an hour!

11:47.507 --> 11:49.042
You must be Astrid?

11:49.042 --> 11:51.111
I'm Miss Martinez

11:51.111 --> 11:52.412
from Children's Services.

11:52.412 --> 11:53.713
I'm here to pick you up.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.415
If you need more time to pack,

11:55.415 --> 11:58.418
I can give you 15 minutes,
but that's it.

11:58.418 --> 11:59.552
I'm not going anywhere.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.288
I'm waiting for my mother
to come home.

12:01.288 --> 12:04.825
Your mother
won't be coming home...

12:04.825 --> 12:06.994
at least not for a while.

12:29.382 --> 12:31.985
In accordance with the laws
of the state of California,

12:31.985 --> 12:35.222
I sentence you
to the term prescribed by law

12:35.222 --> 12:38.658
for murder in the first degree.

12:38.658 --> 12:41.962
Not less than 35 years to life
in a maximum security prison.

13:34.681 --> 13:36.616
Hello, Starr.
How are you?

13:36.616 --> 13:38.351
I'm fine!

13:38.351 --> 13:40.787
How are you?

13:40.787 --> 13:41.654
Good to see you.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.356
Good to see you.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.225
But y'all must be starving
after that long drive.

13:45.225 --> 13:46.426
I hope you like olive loaf,

13:46.426 --> 13:49.462
because I made enough
to feed an army.

13:49.462 --> 13:50.597
How was the traffic?

13:50.597 --> 13:51.965
It was bad downtown,

13:51.965 --> 13:54.501
but it cleared up
pretty fast. Astrid?

13:54.501 --> 13:56.503
There you go.

13:56.503 --> 13:59.873
Astrid Magnussen,
this is Starr Thomas.

13:59.873 --> 14:02.575
It is so nice to meet you,
Astrid.

14:02.575 --> 14:03.576
Come on in!

14:03.576 --> 14:05.578
Let me help you with that.

14:05.578 --> 14:06.713
Was it a long drive?

14:06.713 --> 14:08.115
Yeah.

14:08.115 --> 14:10.050
I hope you didn't bring
a ton of stuff

14:10.050 --> 14:11.885
because you have to
share a bedroom

14:11.885 --> 14:13.420
with my daughter, Carolee.

14:13.420 --> 14:14.922
So this is our home.

14:14.922 --> 14:16.356
This is where
we have company, usually.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.959
And then in here is
the kitchen, and what not.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.994
The boys sleep in here,
in the living room

14:20.994 --> 14:22.595
because we don't have
enough bedrooms.

14:22.595 --> 14:25.598
That's Davey, in the glasses,
and Owen.

14:25.598 --> 14:26.866
This is Astrid, boys.

14:26.866 --> 14:27.935
You say hi?

14:27.935 --> 14:29.836
Carolee?

14:29.836 --> 14:32.239
I said get out here, right now.

14:32.239 --> 14:34.942
Let's just go in there.

14:38.311 --> 14:41.614
This is Carolee, my daughter.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.716
Make some room, okay?

14:43.716 --> 14:46.019
And this is where you're
going to be sleeping.

14:46.019 --> 14:48.755
And she'll clean
all that up, don't worry.

14:48.755 --> 14:51.124
Don't mind her. She's hormonal.

14:51.124 --> 14:54.027
The problem is
she hasn't been saved.

14:54.027 --> 14:55.662
What about you?

14:55.662 --> 14:57.164
What?

14:57.164 --> 15:00.367
Have you accepted Jesus Christ
as your personal savior?

15:00.367 --> 15:01.434
I don't know.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.570
Well, when you do,
he'll be waiting.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.940
This is where Ray and I sleep,
and the bathroom is right here.

15:06.940 --> 15:09.309
Let's go back in here.

15:09.309 --> 15:12.745
Ray's home late tonight
because it's his poker night.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.081
And he's a good man,
and all,

15:14.081 --> 15:16.049
but don't talk to him
about Jesus.

15:16.049 --> 15:18.218
He acts like
he's the repo man or something,

15:18.218 --> 15:20.387
not a carpenter like him.

15:36.603 --> 15:39.439
You must be
the new addition.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.541
I'm Ray.

15:43.510 --> 15:48.048
Or Uncle Ray,
but that's Starr's idea.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.017
Not mine.

15:52.685 --> 15:54.187
I'm Astrid.

15:54.187 --> 15:57.657
It's nice to meet you, Astrid.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.226
You coming in?

16:04.431 --> 16:06.099
How come?

16:06.966 --> 16:09.236
I'm thinking.

16:10.137 --> 16:11.538
What about?

16:16.409 --> 16:18.411
My mother.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.582
Starr was telling me about her.

16:22.582 --> 16:25.685
She's doing time
for killing her boyfriend?

16:29.489 --> 16:32.992
Yeah, well,
those things happen.

16:36.363 --> 16:39.566
Come in when you're ready, okay?

16:44.804 --> 16:47.907
That slut thinks
she can tell me what to do?

16:47.907 --> 16:49.476
She said
I was grounded.

16:49.476 --> 16:51.144
She's the mother
in The Brady Bunch.

16:52.912 --> 16:54.414
Listen to that.

16:56.783 --> 16:58.718
Saved by Jesus.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.387
She's such a hypocrite.

17:00.387 --> 17:03.790
They shouldn't be doing it.
They're not even married.

17:03.790 --> 17:07.294
Reverend Daniels
always sniffing around here,

17:07.294 --> 17:08.694
blah-blah-ing about Jesus.

17:08.694 --> 17:11.231
All he really wants to do
is to look at her ass.

17:15.202 --> 17:17.069
Don't forget
to leave the window open.

17:17.069 --> 17:19.439
Don't look at me like that.

17:19.439 --> 17:21.174
You're no different than I am.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.376
You just don't know it yet.

17:44.197 --> 17:46.966
[BED POUNDING WALL
AND ECSTATIC MOANS]

17:48.235 --> 17:49.436
BARRY:
I'm going to kill you!

17:51.037 --> 17:53.072
I'll strangle you!

17:54.941 --> 17:57.410
You bloody bitch!

18:01.314 --> 18:03.616
Sin is a virus.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.285
That's what
Reverend Thomas says.

18:05.285 --> 18:07.387
It's infecting the whole
country like the clap.

18:07.387 --> 18:09.989
You know they got a clap now
you can't get rid of?

18:09.989 --> 18:12.592
I think we've got
every excuse in the book.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.961
"What's wrong
if I shovel coke up my nose?

18:14.961 --> 18:16.496
Who's it hurting?"

18:16.496 --> 18:18.331
"What's wrong with wanting
to feel good all the time?

18:18.331 --> 18:19.399
Who does it hurt?"

18:19.399 --> 18:20.867
Well, it hurts us.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.402
And it hurts Jesus.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.637
Because it's wrong.

18:24.637 --> 18:26.906
I don't know
how you can swallow that shit.

18:26.906 --> 18:30.310
"He who believeth in me,
though he was dead,

18:30.310 --> 18:32.145
yet will he live."

18:32.145 --> 18:34.314
And don't you forget it, missy.

18:34.314 --> 18:36.649
Here we are.

18:36.649 --> 18:37.450
Are you kidding?

18:37.450 --> 18:39.051
It's a miracle I'm not dead.

18:39.051 --> 18:41.154
They took my kids away
and everything.

18:41.154 --> 18:43.022
I was an alcoholic,
I was a coke head,

18:43.022 --> 18:44.491
I was dancing topless,
you name it.

18:44.491 --> 18:47.227
Shut up, for Christ's sake.
People are staring.

18:47.227 --> 18:50.830
Astrid, look! Look at that!

18:50.830 --> 18:54.601
That is going to go perfect
with your new shoes!

18:54.601 --> 18:56.369
I mean, I really felt like that!

18:56.369 --> 18:58.871
"Who cares if I hang my tits
in some stranger's face?

18:58.871 --> 19:01.341
It's nobody's business but mine.

19:01.341 --> 19:04.511
You know what? This is
going to be good on you.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.682
Astrid,
those are ugly shoes.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.951
Snakes don't bite
above the ankle.

19:11.951 --> 19:13.286
Well, take my word for it,

19:13.286 --> 19:15.288
you're better off
being bitten by snakes

19:15.288 --> 19:17.490
than dressing for them.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.827
Carolee, we need to get her
some bras.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.596
Carolee had her first bra
when she was nine.

19:23.596 --> 19:25.898
You don't want them things
hanging to your knees

19:25.898 --> 19:27.300
when you're 30.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.168
Try it on.
That'll be good on you.

19:30.237 --> 19:33.172
Carolee, will Ray love that?

19:33.172 --> 19:36.276
Look that.
That is so nice!

19:36.276 --> 19:39.145
Hurry, Astrid. It's here!

19:39.145 --> 19:41.514
I told you you were
going to miss it!

19:41.514 --> 19:44.517
Astrid.
This one is for you.

19:48.788 --> 19:49.989
Who is it from?

19:49.989 --> 19:51.658
My mother.

19:51.658 --> 19:54.527
I didn't think
she knew where I was.

19:56.329 --> 19:58.731
INGRID:
Dear Astrid,

19:58.731 --> 20:01.133
have you been getting
my letters?

20:01.133 --> 20:04.036
It's been six months.
Why don't you write?

20:04.036 --> 20:05.838
It's only a few minutes

20:05.838 --> 20:08.207
before
they turn out the lights.

20:08.207 --> 20:12.211
I can hear the women screaming
in their cells.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.947
We're both in prison,
you and I,

20:14.947 --> 20:18.985
punished for our strength
and our independence.

20:18.985 --> 20:20.887
Don't forget who you are.

20:20.887 --> 20:23.356
The best part of me
is well-hidden,

20:23.356 --> 20:25.091
and you have to do the same.

20:25.091 --> 20:29.762
Remember it all,
every insult, every tear.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.241
What are you doing?

20:43.710 --> 20:47.113
I'm writing a letter
to my mother.

20:47.113 --> 20:49.349
You ever write your dad?

20:49.349 --> 20:52.084
I don't know where he is.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.687
I never met him.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.956
He left
when I was two.

20:56.956 --> 20:58.725
Your mother tell you
much about him?

20:58.725 --> 21:01.160
No.

21:01.160 --> 21:02.562
Aren't you curious?

21:02.562 --> 21:05.498
I think about
what he would think of me.

21:05.498 --> 21:08.301
He probably thinks
you're still two.

21:08.301 --> 21:10.370
That's how
I remember my son, Seth.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.104
You have a son?

21:12.104 --> 21:13.272
Yeah.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.174
Hey, Ray!

21:15.174 --> 21:17.910
Hey, Patty.

21:21.681 --> 21:23.916
You're going to the Jesus show?

21:23.916 --> 21:25.385
Aren't you coming?

21:25.385 --> 21:26.719
To Bible study? No.

21:26.719 --> 21:28.621
In my opinion, if there's a God,

21:28.621 --> 21:30.823
he sure as hell
ain't worth praying to.

21:32.559 --> 21:35.762
That sounds like something
my mother would say.

21:35.762 --> 21:39.832
She wouldn't even take me to the
Christmas pageant at school.

21:39.832 --> 21:42.869
She made me
beg a ride off another kid.

21:46.038 --> 21:48.274
Hey, Ray.

21:48.274 --> 21:50.377
How you doing, Reverend?

21:51.944 --> 21:54.013
I don't think
he likes me very much.

21:57.550 --> 21:59.151
Why don't you and Starr
get married?

21:59.151 --> 22:01.220
Because I'm already married.

22:01.220 --> 22:03.990
Astrid, come on in.
We're starting.

22:03.990 --> 22:06.292
Okay, I'm coming.

22:06.292 --> 22:08.294
Where's your wife?

22:08.294 --> 22:11.998
Who knows?

22:11.998 --> 22:16.569
I haven't seen her or my son
in over five years.

22:32.018 --> 22:33.420
I baptize you

22:33.420 --> 22:37.089
in the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

22:49.836 --> 22:53.540
Do you believe in God now?

22:53.540 --> 22:56.275
Maybe it's not
such a bad thing

22:56.275 --> 22:58.511
to believe
in something.

22:58.511 --> 23:00.346
It's better to know things.

23:00.346 --> 23:02.549
Why?

23:02.549 --> 23:04.150
What does knowing things
get you?

23:04.150 --> 23:05.652
Does it tell you
the difference

23:05.652 --> 23:08.821
between right or wrong?

23:11.323 --> 23:15.528
She didn't
kill that guy alone.

23:15.528 --> 23:19.932
I knew what my mother
was doing, you know?

23:19.932 --> 23:23.636
I could've saved his life
but I didn't.

23:52.532 --> 23:54.166
Come on.

24:05.978 --> 24:08.615
BARRY:
I'm going to kill you, Ingrid!

24:10.249 --> 24:13.219
You think there was something
valuable on that hard disk?

24:13.219 --> 24:15.622
Maybe a collection of essays

24:15.622 --> 24:17.857
due at the publisher's
this fall.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.429
You bloody bitch!

24:23.429 --> 24:24.997
You can't
do this to me!

24:24.997 --> 24:27.534
INGRID:
You don't know
what I can do.

24:31.003 --> 24:33.205
MAN:
Know your inmate's number.

24:35.608 --> 24:39.646
No number, no visit.

24:39.646 --> 24:41.080
Hey, baby.

24:58.631 --> 25:00.032
MAN:
Astrid Magnussen?

25:04.236 --> 25:07.239
Astrid? Follow me.

25:27.293 --> 25:28.695
Momma.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.802
No, no, no, no, no.

25:37.469 --> 25:39.706
Don't cry.

25:39.706 --> 25:40.873
We're not like that.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.909
We're the Vikings, remember?

25:49.448 --> 25:52.518
You're so beautiful.

25:52.518 --> 25:54.754
Prison agrees with me.

25:54.754 --> 25:56.756
There's no hypocrisy here.

25:56.756 --> 25:59.959
Kill or be killed,
and everybody knows it.

26:02.261 --> 26:05.064
Do they hurt you?

26:05.064 --> 26:07.333
Not as much as I hurt them.

26:10.236 --> 26:14.707
I won't be in here forever,
I promise you that.

26:14.707 --> 26:16.709
One day,
you'll look out your window,

26:16.709 --> 26:18.577
and I'll be there.

26:20.813 --> 26:24.216
Your hair smells like clover.

26:24.216 --> 26:27.687
I want to remember you
just like this

26:27.687 --> 26:32.191
in that sadly hopeful
pink dress.

26:32.191 --> 26:34.560
Starr picked it out.

26:34.560 --> 26:37.664
Of course she did.

26:40.399 --> 26:42.334
What's that?

26:42.334 --> 26:45.337
Nothing.

26:45.337 --> 26:47.339
It's just a cross.

26:47.339 --> 26:49.341
I know it's a cross.

26:52.411 --> 26:53.780
Why are you wearing it?

26:53.780 --> 26:58.484
It's a present from Starr.

26:58.484 --> 27:01.087
She force you to go to church?

27:01.087 --> 27:04.023
They're really nice people.

27:04.023 --> 27:05.658
It's called the Assembly of God.

27:05.658 --> 27:07.159
To join,

27:07.159 --> 27:09.762
you have to accept Christ
as your personal savior.

27:09.762 --> 27:11.297
Then you're baptized.

27:11.297 --> 27:13.900
They call it being washed
in the blood of the lamb.

27:13.900 --> 27:16.335
But really
it's just water.

27:19.038 --> 27:21.908
Have you accepted Christ
as your personal savior?

27:21.908 --> 27:25.344
There's nothing wrong
with being a Christian.

27:25.344 --> 27:26.979
Are you out of your mind?

27:29.581 --> 27:30.783
How did this happen?

27:30.783 --> 27:32.184
I raised you.

27:32.184 --> 27:34.186
Not a pack
of Bible-thumping trailer trash.

27:34.186 --> 27:36.622
I raised you
to think for yourself.

27:36.622 --> 27:38.991
No, you didn't.

27:41.928 --> 27:44.964
You raised me to think like you.

27:44.964 --> 27:47.900
And maybe
thinking for yourself

27:47.900 --> 27:49.736
isn't so great.

27:49.736 --> 27:51.771
Reverend Daniels says it's evil.

27:51.771 --> 27:54.206
Evil?

27:54.206 --> 27:57.409
If thinking for yourself
is evil,

27:57.409 --> 27:59.411
then every artist is evil.

27:59.411 --> 28:00.512
Is that what you believe?

28:00.512 --> 28:01.513
Now that
you've been washed

28:01.513 --> 28:02.815
in the blood
of the lamb?

28:02.815 --> 28:06.118
Man's ability to reason is evil.
Am I evil?

28:06.118 --> 28:08.087
No.

28:10.222 --> 28:12.892
No...

28:12.892 --> 28:15.327
But killing people
who don't want you is evil.

28:16.896 --> 28:19.198
We pray for your
redemption every Sunday.

28:19.198 --> 28:21.400
Fuck my redemption.
I don't want to be redeemed.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.169
I regret nothing.

28:23.169 --> 28:26.038
MAN ON LOUDSPEAKER:
Attention, please.
Visiting hours are over.

28:28.607 --> 28:32.812
It's good that you're trying
to identify evil, Astrid.

28:32.812 --> 28:35.547
But evil is tricky.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.950
Just when you think
you know what it is,

28:37.950 --> 28:39.618
it changes its form.

28:39.618 --> 28:44.623
Learning its nature takes
a lifetime of study.

28:44.623 --> 28:47.827
I will not lose you.

28:47.827 --> 28:50.662
Not to them.

28:50.662 --> 28:52.498
Those people
are the enemy, Astrid.

28:52.498 --> 28:54.934
MAN ON LOUDSPEAKER:
Visiting hours are over.

28:55.734 --> 28:56.869
Write to me.

28:56.869 --> 28:58.104
Time's up.

28:58.104 --> 29:01.540
Write to me.
At least once a week.

29:01.540 --> 29:07.079
I'm the only person you know
who can keep you honest.

29:12.184 --> 29:14.987
Don't forget who you are,
Astrid.

29:16.255 --> 29:20.159
You're my daughter
and you're perfect, remember?

29:53.092 --> 29:55.661
How far away is it?

29:55.661 --> 29:57.263
About a mile.

29:57.263 --> 29:59.731
Maybe two.

29:59.731 --> 30:01.533
Shouldn't we
pack up and go?

30:01.533 --> 30:03.035
Not yet.

30:03.035 --> 30:05.537
The wind is still in our favor.

30:09.408 --> 30:11.510
My mother used
to love fire season.

30:11.510 --> 30:18.117
She made me decide what I'd take
if we had to go.

30:18.117 --> 30:22.121
She said if I was brave,
I wouldn't take anything.

30:22.121 --> 30:24.957
Your mother sounds tough.

30:24.957 --> 30:26.658
Not like you.

30:26.658 --> 30:29.761
What am I like?

30:29.761 --> 30:32.965
You, you're...

30:32.965 --> 30:35.001
you're a sweetheart.

30:42.909 --> 30:45.711
Astrid, honey.

30:45.711 --> 30:47.446
Astrid?

30:48.747 --> 30:51.583
Come on in here a minute.

30:58.590 --> 31:00.326
Sit down. I won't bite.

31:05.898 --> 31:07.166
You're having fun here
aren't you?

31:07.166 --> 31:10.102
Making yourself at home,
getting comfortable?

31:14.040 --> 31:15.607
A little too comfortable,
I'd say.

31:17.910 --> 31:20.279
I may not be some genius,
but I'm getting your game.

31:20.279 --> 31:22.348
And believe me,
it takes one to know one.

31:22.348 --> 31:23.515
One what?

31:23.515 --> 31:26.318
Always hanging around,
handling his tools.

31:26.318 --> 31:28.854
"What's this for, Uncle Ray?
Can I help you, Uncle Ray?"

31:28.854 --> 31:31.490
We're not doing anything.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.459
I'm calling Children's Services
I want you to know.

31:33.459 --> 31:37.363
It's all over for you,
little missy.

31:37.363 --> 31:39.698
But--
Don't "but" me.

31:39.698 --> 31:41.833
He is a man.

31:41.833 --> 31:45.571
And he sees what he sees,
and he does what he can.

31:45.571 --> 31:48.174
I've got a nice thing
going here.

31:48.174 --> 31:50.042
Ray is the best man
I ever had,

31:50.042 --> 31:51.110
and I've lived too long

31:51.110 --> 31:53.012
and come too far
to blow it now.

31:55.647 --> 31:57.283
I never had a father.

31:57.283 --> 31:59.251
Don't.

32:01.087 --> 32:03.089
I've got myself and my
own kids to worry about.

32:03.089 --> 32:05.057
You and me, we hardly
know each other.

32:05.057 --> 32:07.659
I don't owe you a thing.

32:09.461 --> 32:11.897
Jesus would give me a chance.

32:11.897 --> 32:16.668
Well, I'm not Jesus,
not even close.

32:22.174 --> 32:24.610
He might be mad...

32:24.610 --> 32:27.213
if he knew you sent me away
because you were jealous.

32:30.116 --> 32:32.284
You're trying
to make him a prisoner.

32:32.284 --> 32:33.685
He's going to hate you.

32:35.988 --> 32:37.823
What do you know about men?

32:37.823 --> 32:40.559
I know that men don't like women
who try to own them.

32:41.693 --> 32:43.029
I like you.

32:43.029 --> 32:45.164
I like the kids.

32:45.164 --> 32:47.599
I would never do anything
to screw it up.

32:49.601 --> 32:52.571
You swear
you're not interested in him?

32:52.571 --> 32:55.707
I swear to God.

33:01.013 --> 33:02.548
There! Did you see it?

33:02.548 --> 33:05.617
I'm not sure.

33:05.617 --> 33:06.852
You see anything yet?

33:06.852 --> 33:08.520
It's just starting.

33:08.520 --> 33:11.157
But we should be getting
40 an hour pretty soon.

33:11.157 --> 33:12.524
The Quadrantid

33:12.524 --> 33:14.526
is the shortest-lived
meteorite shower,

33:14.526 --> 33:17.729
but the densest,
except for the Perseids.

33:26.905 --> 33:29.075
You and Starr,
you having a beef?

33:31.643 --> 33:34.746
No. Why?

33:38.184 --> 33:40.386
Just something she said.

33:46.024 --> 33:49.895
Guess it's hard,
getting older...

33:49.895 --> 33:53.165
pretty girl
coming up in the house.

33:53.165 --> 33:54.566
Ray, honey?

33:54.566 --> 33:57.936
What are you
doing out here?

33:57.936 --> 34:00.772
Nothing, baby.
Just having a smoke.

34:08.947 --> 34:11.382
Looking at the stars.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.058
STARR: And this is
40 dollars,

34:20.058 --> 34:22.328
not even
40 dollars a month.

34:22.328 --> 34:23.594
And you waste

34:23.594 --> 34:25.231
200 dollars
in one night?

34:25.231 --> 34:26.831
And you been
doing it weekly.

34:26.831 --> 34:28.167
RAY:
Listen, I won last week.

34:28.167 --> 34:29.835
What else you doing
with the money, Ray?

34:31.303 --> 34:33.172
You can't even
look at me!

34:33.172 --> 34:34.639
I'm looking
right at you.

34:34.639 --> 34:36.875
You weren't when
I asked you that question.

34:36.875 --> 34:38.444
And you got your car
out there.

34:38.444 --> 34:41.179
God knows what
you spend on that.

34:41.179 --> 34:43.181
That comes out of my pocket.
No, it doesn't.

34:43.181 --> 34:44.850
Don't ruin this.

34:44.850 --> 34:46.685
Ruin what?

34:49.321 --> 34:51.223
She's drinking again.

34:51.223 --> 34:52.623
And who else were you with?

34:52.623 --> 34:54.592
I saw you eyeing her
the other day.

35:12.144 --> 35:14.180
Thought you were all
going to a movie?

35:14.980 --> 35:16.782
I had a lot of homework.

35:16.782 --> 35:20.352
How come
you aren't playing poker?

35:20.352 --> 35:23.322
The game got cancelled.

35:26.225 --> 35:27.793
They coming home soon?

35:27.793 --> 35:30.862
Not too long.

35:33.899 --> 35:37.068
Well, there's plenty of food,
if you want.

35:37.068 --> 35:38.737
Thanks.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.614
This isn't right.

37:12.564 --> 37:15.367
Is everyone gone?

37:18.704 --> 37:20.439
STARR: It is
all my business!

37:20.439 --> 37:23.074
This is my house!

37:23.074 --> 37:24.075
You have to abide

37:24.075 --> 37:26.378
by the laws
that I put down!

37:26.378 --> 37:29.581
I waited up for you
all night long.

37:29.581 --> 37:31.650
I want to know
who you were with.

37:31.650 --> 37:32.884
Don't give me
your shit!

37:32.884 --> 37:34.586
You stayed up all night
to drink!

37:34.586 --> 37:36.955
I stayed up to catch you,
you whore!

37:36.955 --> 37:38.757
You should know.

37:40.959 --> 37:43.729
Try it again,
I'll take you out, bitch.

37:45.897 --> 37:47.198
Carolee!

37:47.198 --> 37:50.402
You walk out that door,
don't bother coming back.

37:50.402 --> 37:51.870
Why the hell
would I want to?

37:51.870 --> 37:54.239
I've been down this road
with you before,

37:54.239 --> 37:55.674
Mom.

37:57.108 --> 37:58.143
Sorry, Davey.

37:58.143 --> 38:00.746
I can't
go through this again.

38:03.014 --> 38:05.016
Carolee!

38:14.826 --> 38:16.395
STARR: You used
to like it fine

38:16.395 --> 38:19.898
before you started doing
that little bitch!

38:19.898 --> 38:22.434
Admit it, you bastard!
You're screwing her!

38:22.434 --> 38:23.769
Call your sponsor.
Screw my sponsor!

38:23.769 --> 38:25.303
Go back to bed.

38:25.303 --> 38:28.073
I should've gotten rid of her
when I had the chance.

38:28.073 --> 38:29.575
You know what I'm going to do?

38:29.575 --> 38:32.444
I'm going to go in there,
and I'm going to cash her check.

38:32.444 --> 38:34.446
Hey, Starr, stop it.

38:34.446 --> 38:35.714
Hey! Stop!

38:38.484 --> 38:39.818
What the hell is wrong

38:39.818 --> 38:40.886
Get off of me!

38:43.422 --> 38:44.723
Starr!

38:44.723 --> 38:45.724
Starr!

38:47.493 --> 38:51.329
Get off of me, goddamn it!
Get off of me!

38:51.329 --> 38:53.632
[STARR SCREAMING
AND GLASS BREAKING]

39:12.751 --> 39:14.486
INGRID:
No, don't cry.

39:14.486 --> 39:16.187
We're not like that.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.390
We're the Vikings, remember?

39:22.461 --> 39:24.229
Astrid?

39:24.229 --> 39:26.364
Astrid

39:26.364 --> 39:28.233
Astrid. Talk to me.

39:28.233 --> 39:30.101
Can you talk to me?

39:30.101 --> 39:31.102
Okay, she's coming around.

39:31.102 --> 39:32.303
This boy saved your life.

39:32.303 --> 39:37.409
If he hadn't called 911,
you'd be dead.

39:37.409 --> 39:39.377
Who did this to you?
Who shot you?

39:39.377 --> 39:40.446
I don't know.

39:40.446 --> 39:42.981
Watch your feet.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.521
Where's Ray, Davey?

39:49.521 --> 39:51.523
He's gone.

39:51.523 --> 39:53.124
They're both gone!

39:55.260 --> 39:57.262
I'm sorry.

39:57.262 --> 39:59.431
I'm so sorry
I ruined it.

39:59.431 --> 40:00.599
Doesn't matter.

40:00.599 --> 40:03.034
Something would have.

40:03.034 --> 40:05.136
Bye, Astrid.

40:05.136 --> 40:06.137
MAN: Watch the step.

40:06.137 --> 40:07.606
We got you, Astrid.

40:09.975 --> 40:11.743
Okay, step.

40:59.991 --> 41:02.127
We'd prefer to find you
a permanent placement,

41:02.127 --> 41:05.030
but we have so many children
on our books right now.

41:05.030 --> 41:06.965
The hospital said
you need special attention

41:06.965 --> 41:08.834
which you'll get
at McKinney Hall.

41:08.834 --> 41:10.602
They have all sorts
of activities

41:10.602 --> 41:11.937
for young people.

41:20.078 --> 41:22.881
You're dead, bitch!
You hear me? You are dead.

41:24.015 --> 41:27.018
Don't you ever look at my
boyfriend again, you hear me?

41:27.018 --> 41:29.087
Don't ever look
at my boyfriend again.

41:29.087 --> 41:31.757
If you look at my boyfriend,
you're dead!

42:46.031 --> 42:47.999
The next time you and
your friends jump me,

42:47.999 --> 42:52.170
I'll cut your throats
when you're sleeping.

43:08.319 --> 43:10.689
What do you want?

43:10.689 --> 43:14.425
I was looking at your picture.

43:14.425 --> 43:16.027
It's good.

43:18.196 --> 43:20.932
Who is it?

43:24.770 --> 43:27.472
How come
you chopped off your hair?

43:27.472 --> 43:29.074
None of your business.

43:33.645 --> 43:34.980
You're still beautiful.

43:34.980 --> 43:36.447
Looks don't interest me.

43:36.447 --> 43:41.987
That's easy for you to say,
you've never been ugly.

44:07.713 --> 44:09.447
Oh, look.

44:09.447 --> 44:10.816
It's the puta.

44:10.816 --> 44:12.784
She's so ugly now, huh?

44:51.489 --> 44:54.092
You're not ugly.

45:01.767 --> 45:03.501
INGRID:
You write as if

45:03.501 --> 45:05.203
you're surprised to find me
still beautiful, even here.

45:05.203 --> 45:09.908
Our beauty is our power,
our strength.

45:09.908 --> 45:13.945
We can't allow them
to change us, to lessen us.

45:13.945 --> 45:17.849
I will never grant them
that satisfaction,

45:17.849 --> 45:19.217
and neither should you.

45:28.326 --> 45:30.829
So is this
your first time in Mac?

45:33.698 --> 45:34.699
Figured.

45:34.699 --> 45:37.502
You're so unfriendly.

45:37.502 --> 45:40.205
Life is easier
without friends.

45:40.205 --> 45:42.473
Maybe.

45:42.473 --> 45:43.875
I like it here.

45:43.875 --> 45:46.077
It's better
than being in a foster home.

45:46.077 --> 45:48.947
It's the floor
you can't fall below.

45:53.651 --> 45:55.620
What's that?

45:55.620 --> 45:58.356
A letter.

45:58.356 --> 46:00.458
From who?

46:00.458 --> 46:01.659
My mother.

46:01.659 --> 46:03.795
And where is she?

46:03.795 --> 46:06.331
In prison. For murder.

46:06.331 --> 46:08.566
And your father?

46:08.566 --> 46:10.836
Don't know the guy.

46:13.504 --> 46:14.772
How about you?

46:14.772 --> 46:17.909
Oh, they were junkies.

46:17.909 --> 46:19.945
She O.D.'d when I was six,

46:19.945 --> 46:21.779
and he disappeared
a couple years later.

46:21.779 --> 46:23.014
I was born addicted to heroin.

46:23.014 --> 46:24.749
Really

46:24.749 --> 46:26.217
I don't know.

46:26.217 --> 46:29.187
I was out of rehab by the time
I was six months old.

46:33.224 --> 46:34.325
So...

46:35.994 --> 46:37.929
What's the deal?
Are you gay?

46:37.929 --> 46:40.298
What?

46:40.298 --> 46:43.334
I don't know, I get this
funny feeling from you,

46:43.334 --> 46:45.837
like you're not interested
in guys.

46:47.939 --> 46:49.841
You're right, I'm not.

46:50.976 --> 46:52.477
GIRL 1:
You think
that's funny?

46:52.477 --> 46:54.779
I'm sick of this. I'm not going
to let you do this again.

46:54.779 --> 46:57.548
Why don't you
shut up, okay?

47:11.362 --> 47:13.298
ASTRID:
What if they catch us?

47:13.298 --> 47:15.566
They'd put us in McKinney Hall.

47:15.566 --> 47:17.168
Come on!

47:22.007 --> 47:25.010
The guy is a genius.

47:25.010 --> 47:27.879
I started out
copying his stuff, but...

47:27.879 --> 47:33.418
I could never touch him.

47:33.418 --> 47:35.853
He's great.

47:35.853 --> 47:37.455
But you're better.

47:40.691 --> 47:42.593
You're insane.

47:45.596 --> 47:46.998
No, I'm not.

47:46.998 --> 47:51.602
He's a great cartoonist,
but you're an artist.

47:51.602 --> 47:53.604
What's the difference?

47:56.274 --> 47:59.510
That's like asking
why a joke is funny.

47:59.510 --> 48:01.679
Either it's funny
or it's not.

48:01.679 --> 48:04.682
You're either an artist
or you're not.

48:04.682 --> 48:06.884
You are.

48:33.311 --> 48:34.645
That's good.

49:45.516 --> 49:48.653
There's another one!
Do you see it.

49:48.653 --> 49:50.721
Yeah.

49:56.694 --> 50:00.698
The Lyrids shower
is visible most of the night.

50:00.698 --> 50:03.368
The brightest star is Vega...

50:03.368 --> 50:05.002
but you can't look right at it

50:05.002 --> 50:07.872
or you'll miss
the fainter meteors.

50:07.872 --> 50:11.742
You can trace them back to Lyra.

50:11.742 --> 50:14.345
How do you know
all that?

50:18.349 --> 50:20.751
A kid I used to know.

50:32.330 --> 50:35.766
I used to have a foster home
right over there.

50:41.439 --> 50:44.375
It's nice living on the beach.

50:51.015 --> 50:56.587
Do you ever think about
your father?

50:56.587 --> 50:59.790
Not really.
He was an asshole.

51:03.961 --> 51:08.333
I think
about mine sometimes.

51:08.333 --> 51:11.202
That when I'm an artist,

51:11.202 --> 51:13.104
he'll read about me
in the papers

51:13.104 --> 51:16.607
and he'll want
to meet me.

51:24.014 --> 51:26.384
I'm not gay.

51:28.953 --> 51:30.155
I know that.

51:56.013 --> 51:58.516
I'll show you
the one he did of me.

52:06.957 --> 52:08.159
It's right...

52:08.159 --> 52:09.527
right here.

52:09.527 --> 52:11.896
They're not bad
for what they are.

52:11.896 --> 52:15.866
For what they are?

52:15.866 --> 52:17.835
What are they?

52:17.835 --> 52:20.738
Cartoons.

52:20.738 --> 52:22.673
No, they're not.

52:22.673 --> 52:24.275
They're so much more
than that.

52:24.275 --> 52:26.110
He's really talented.

52:26.110 --> 52:28.979
Don't do it again, Astrid.

52:28.979 --> 52:30.114
Do what again?

52:30.114 --> 52:31.816
Attach yourself

52:31.816 --> 52:34.552
to anyone who shows you
the least bit of attention

52:34.552 --> 52:35.886
because you're lonely.

52:35.886 --> 52:40.725
Loneliness
is the human condition.

52:40.725 --> 52:43.961
No one is ever going to
fill that space.

52:43.961 --> 52:46.797
The best you can do
is know yourself,

52:46.797 --> 52:47.798
know what you want,

52:47.798 --> 52:51.336
and don't let the cattle
get in the way.

52:51.336 --> 52:54.239
You're not talking about me.

52:54.239 --> 52:57.308
You're talking about yourself.

52:57.308 --> 52:58.576
Sometimes I get the feeling

52:58.576 --> 53:00.278
you don't even want me
to be happy.

53:00.278 --> 53:05.750
Why wouldn't I want you
to be happy?

53:15.326 --> 53:17.628
Where are they
sending you?

53:17.628 --> 53:19.630
I don't know.

53:22.900 --> 53:24.235
Look...

53:28.406 --> 53:31.376
The comic book store
will hold letters for me.

53:31.376 --> 53:34.779
Wherever they take you,
keep checking there.

54:36.206 --> 54:39.410
Why do we have to go all the way
to Mexico to buy this stuff?

54:39.410 --> 54:41.278
It isn't FDA approved.

54:41.278 --> 54:45.383
What's it called?

54:45.383 --> 54:47.852
DMSO.

54:47.852 --> 54:50.588
What's it for?

54:50.588 --> 54:54.291
All sorts of things.

55:00.665 --> 55:02.166
You'll like these people.

55:02.166 --> 55:04.569
She's an actress and he does
something in television.

55:07.037 --> 55:08.072
Do they have any kids?

55:08.072 --> 55:11.942
No. They're looking to adopt.

56:03.861 --> 56:06.597
She's had
an incredibly hard time.

56:06.597 --> 56:07.832
She's very smart,

56:07.832 --> 56:09.467
she's just missed
a lot of school.

56:09.467 --> 56:10.701
Mm.

56:11.669 --> 56:13.237
Look, you don't have
to decide immediately.

56:13.237 --> 56:15.105
Okay.

56:15.105 --> 56:16.574
Just talk to her,

56:16.574 --> 56:19.243
and if you're uncomfortable
in any way,

56:19.243 --> 56:20.445
you just let me know.

56:36.193 --> 56:39.129
There you are.

56:39.129 --> 56:42.633
I'm really sorry that Mark
couldn't be here to meet you,

56:42.633 --> 56:46.003
but he's filming
in Nova Scotia, so...

56:46.003 --> 56:48.639
Well, this is it!

56:48.639 --> 56:50.407
I left it plain on purpose

56:50.407 --> 56:53.143
because I thought

56:53.143 --> 56:55.245
that way you could put
your own things up.

56:55.245 --> 56:59.116
I like the D rer watercolor.

56:59.116 --> 57:00.551
You know who D rer is?

57:00.551 --> 57:02.820
My mother is an artist.

57:02.820 --> 57:05.155
Oh. That's right.
Of course.

57:05.155 --> 57:07.492
Of course, they said that.

57:07.492 --> 57:11.496
Hey, listen, do you want
some tea or something?

57:11.496 --> 57:13.598
Or Pepsi. I bought Pepsi.

57:13.598 --> 57:15.566
I mean, I didn't know
what you'd drink.

57:15.566 --> 57:16.767
Or we have juice.

57:16.767 --> 57:19.169
I could make you
a smoothie if you like.

57:19.169 --> 57:21.338
Would you like
a smoothie?

57:21.338 --> 57:22.907
Tea is fine.

57:27.444 --> 57:30.915
I walk, I walk, stop...

57:30.915 --> 57:33.584
look...

57:33.584 --> 57:36.554
And now I die.

57:42.459 --> 57:43.794
You're really good.

57:43.794 --> 57:45.596
Do you know
what a nightmare it is?

57:45.596 --> 57:47.031
It's such a nightmare.

57:47.031 --> 57:49.199
I mean, you spend
all this time getting ready,

57:49.199 --> 57:50.535
ages, getting ready,

57:50.535 --> 57:53.003
drag yourself
down to this audition

57:53.003 --> 57:55.405
so they can look at you
for two seconds,

57:55.405 --> 57:58.475
and tell you
that you're too ethnic,

57:58.475 --> 58:01.345
or too classic, too something.

58:01.345 --> 58:03.313
Too ethnic?
Mm-hm.

58:03.313 --> 58:05.015
It means brunette.

58:06.617 --> 58:09.219
And too classic means old.

58:09.219 --> 58:12.222
And...too small?

58:12.222 --> 58:13.558
Breasts.

58:13.558 --> 58:16.426
Why do you do it then?

58:16.426 --> 58:18.162
What do you mean?

58:18.162 --> 58:19.964
Give up show business?

58:36.213 --> 58:37.948
Come on!

58:48.192 --> 58:50.928
Here. To your first
run on the beach.

58:50.928 --> 58:54.531
Well done.
Never again.

58:54.531 --> 58:56.433
How is your shoulder?

58:56.433 --> 58:58.636
It's fine.

58:58.636 --> 59:02.272
You did really well!
Really, really well.

59:17.054 --> 59:18.088
What was...

59:18.088 --> 59:22.292
the best day
of your life?

59:27.898 --> 59:29.299
Today.

59:31.769 --> 59:32.937
What should we do later?

59:32.937 --> 59:37.441
I don't know.
What do you want to do?

59:37.441 --> 59:38.909
Swim?

59:38.909 --> 59:39.977
Okay.

59:43.113 --> 59:45.349
Oh, my God!

59:45.349 --> 59:47.618
He's back early!

59:53.223 --> 59:54.324
Mark!

01:00:09.874 --> 01:00:11.075
You must be Astrid.

01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:16.046
It took us three hours
to get him back in there.

01:00:16.046 --> 01:00:18.248
The whole film crew
is gathered around.

01:00:18.248 --> 01:00:20.851
He still almost
chickens out.

01:00:20.851 --> 01:00:21.786
I think he thought

01:00:21.786 --> 01:00:23.020
it was going
to come back

01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:25.222
and try and
finish him off.

01:00:25.222 --> 01:00:27.391
What would you have done
if it had?

01:00:27.391 --> 01:00:29.393
I would have ducked.

01:00:34.498 --> 01:00:35.565
Perfect.

01:00:35.565 --> 01:00:37.968
Just right there.

01:00:45.776 --> 01:00:47.377
Well, cheers.

01:00:47.377 --> 01:00:49.113
Cheers.
Cheers, Astrid.

01:00:52.182 --> 01:00:54.885
We've got some
catching up to do.

01:00:54.885 --> 01:00:57.321
Claire tells me
you're quite an artist.

01:00:57.321 --> 01:00:58.756
Not really.

01:00:58.756 --> 01:01:00.825
She's wonderful!

01:01:00.825 --> 01:01:02.392
In fact, we went
to see Trish,

01:01:02.392 --> 01:01:03.527
and she's accepted Astrid

01:01:03.527 --> 01:01:05.195
for one of
her watercolor classes.

01:01:05.195 --> 01:01:06.731
At the museum?
Mm-hm. Yeah.

01:01:06.731 --> 01:01:08.298
She loves
Astrid's work.

01:01:08.298 --> 01:01:11.736
You should show him!

01:01:17.775 --> 01:01:19.944
They're really,
really beautiful.

01:01:19.944 --> 01:01:21.812
And she's never
even studied.

01:01:21.812 --> 01:01:22.813
She's completely
self-taught.

01:01:22.813 --> 01:01:24.414
Is that right?
Mm-hm.

01:01:32.456 --> 01:01:33.457
Is she all right?

01:01:39.663 --> 01:01:41.665
INGRID:
I know you're perfect.

01:01:41.665 --> 01:01:43.400
ASTRID:
I'm not perfect.

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:45.369
Of course you are.
You're my daughter.

01:01:45.369 --> 01:01:46.804
Hey.

01:01:46.804 --> 01:01:48.773
Are you okay?

01:01:48.773 --> 01:01:51.809
Yeah. Just thinking.

01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:57.714
Are you getting
my letters?

01:01:57.714 --> 01:01:59.616
Yes.

01:01:59.616 --> 01:02:01.451
I can never be sure.

01:02:01.451 --> 01:02:03.187
I get them.

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:08.725
Why doesn't she have
any children?

01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:11.528
She can't have them.

01:02:11.528 --> 01:02:15.232
You dress like her now.

01:02:19.003 --> 01:02:21.471
She takes me shopping.

01:02:23.874 --> 01:02:25.275
What's her husband like?

01:02:28.846 --> 01:02:30.480
He's nice.

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.983
He's gone a lot.

01:02:32.983 --> 01:02:37.221
So you spend
most of your time with Claire?

01:02:37.221 --> 01:02:40.524
Yeah.

01:02:42.626 --> 01:02:44.161
I'd like to meet her.

01:02:44.161 --> 01:02:46.130
Why?

01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:50.100
Because you don't want me to.

01:02:54.905 --> 01:02:57.307
Who did this belong to?

01:02:57.307 --> 01:03:03.180
That was my great aunt's,
on my father's side.

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:05.649
She was a field nurse
at Ypres.

01:03:05.649 --> 01:03:07.451
Very, very brave woman.

01:03:07.451 --> 01:03:09.519
It's pretty, isn't it?

01:03:14.058 --> 01:03:15.659
And whose was this?

01:03:15.659 --> 01:03:17.027
It was my mother's.

01:03:17.027 --> 01:03:19.196
My father gave it to her.

01:03:19.196 --> 01:03:22.766
My parents were
completely inseparable.

01:03:22.766 --> 01:03:25.435
Not at all like Mark and I.

01:03:28.072 --> 01:03:31.541
I hate it when he has
to go away for so long.

01:03:31.541 --> 01:03:34.945
Why don't you go with him?

01:03:34.945 --> 01:03:37.314
He says it slows him down.

01:03:41.051 --> 01:03:44.821
I think it's because
he's having an affair.

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:46.957
He wouldn't have an affair.

01:03:46.957 --> 01:03:48.558
He loves you.

01:03:48.558 --> 01:03:52.062
Yeah, I know.

01:03:52.062 --> 01:03:55.599
If he did,
I would never know about it.

01:03:55.599 --> 01:03:57.567
You're just
being paranoid.

01:03:57.567 --> 01:04:00.670
Yeah, that's what he says.

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:03.273
I "can be very negative."

01:04:16.921 --> 01:04:17.988
Should I put this here?

01:04:17.988 --> 01:04:19.523
Yeah, perfect.

01:04:19.523 --> 01:04:21.325
Everything ready inside?

01:04:28.966 --> 01:04:30.634
You're leaving tomorrow?

01:04:30.634 --> 01:04:32.636
Mm-hm. In the morning.

01:04:34.204 --> 01:04:37.975
I bet Claire would love
to go with you.

01:04:37.975 --> 01:04:42.179
Coordinating our schedules
is difficult.

01:04:42.179 --> 01:04:45.916
She's not working,
she could fit into yours.

01:04:45.916 --> 01:04:48.152
What about you?

01:04:48.152 --> 01:04:51.355
Doesn't she need
to be here for you?

01:04:51.355 --> 01:04:52.356
Yeah.

01:04:54.158 --> 01:04:57.694
How is she these days,
when I'm gone?

01:04:57.694 --> 01:04:59.629
She okay?

01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:00.730
She's fine.

01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:02.299
Why do you ask?

01:05:02.299 --> 01:05:03.667
No reason.

01:05:25.189 --> 01:05:27.557
You're back early.

01:05:27.557 --> 01:05:31.628
How long has my mother
been writing you?

01:05:31.628 --> 01:05:34.331
Oh...not long.

01:05:34.331 --> 01:05:37.001
We've only written to each other
a couple of times.

01:05:37.001 --> 01:05:39.269
Why didn't you tell me?

01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:41.571
Because she asked me not to.

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:46.576
She thought that
you wouldn't like it.

01:05:49.713 --> 01:05:53.683
Her letter was so powerful.

01:05:53.683 --> 01:05:55.552
She's so strong.

01:05:57.187 --> 01:06:00.957
And God,
she's talented.

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.362
We'd like to meet.

01:06:07.964 --> 01:06:10.534
Whose idea was that?

01:06:10.534 --> 01:06:12.269
Mine.

01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:15.705
I bet.

01:06:18.075 --> 01:06:20.610
I really love your work.

01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:21.645
What have you seen?

01:06:21.645 --> 01:06:24.648
Astrid showed me
the collages you sent her

01:06:24.648 --> 01:06:27.051
and some of your earlier work
in the catalogues.

01:06:27.051 --> 01:06:30.220
Oh, I love
the Polaroid installation.

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:32.322
Oh, really?
Yeah.

01:06:32.322 --> 01:06:33.123
Why?

01:06:33.123 --> 01:06:37.094
Um, I don't know...

01:06:37.094 --> 01:06:40.730
Well, because...

01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:42.532
Because it's great!

01:06:45.335 --> 01:06:47.637
I'm actually
very visual myself.

01:06:47.637 --> 01:06:49.239
Kindred spirit.

01:06:51.375 --> 01:06:55.112
Must be difficult
for you to work here.

01:06:55.112 --> 01:06:57.281
Oh, it is.

01:06:57.281 --> 01:06:59.883
I spend so much time
fighting off sexual advances,

01:06:59.883 --> 01:07:01.751
I hardly have time to think.

01:07:04.688 --> 01:07:07.124
That was a joke.

01:07:07.124 --> 01:07:08.425
Oh.

01:07:10.727 --> 01:07:13.097
Jailbird humor
is hard to get sometimes.

01:07:13.097 --> 01:07:14.564
Sorry.

01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:17.501
So...

01:07:17.501 --> 01:07:19.035
an actress?

01:07:19.035 --> 01:07:21.305
So glamorous!

01:07:21.305 --> 01:07:24.174
No. My career
is a disaster.

01:07:24.174 --> 01:07:27.144
I think it's the process.

01:07:27.144 --> 01:07:30.013
It may be too painful for me.

01:07:30.013 --> 01:07:31.781
You're such a sensitive person.

01:07:31.781 --> 01:07:33.183
All that rejection.

01:07:33.183 --> 01:07:35.419
It's got to be hard
on your self-esteem.

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:38.788
I'm a typical Pisces.

01:07:38.788 --> 01:07:41.258
But that's why
Astrid and I get on so well.

01:07:41.258 --> 01:07:44.328
Scorpio and Pisces
understand each other.

01:07:44.328 --> 01:07:47.397
You're into astrology?

01:07:47.397 --> 01:07:48.598
She's not
into astrology

01:07:48.598 --> 01:07:51.101
just because
she knows our signs.

01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:57.941
Astrid and I
used to understand each other...

01:07:57.941 --> 01:07:59.776
but she's become so secretive.

01:07:59.776 --> 01:08:02.312
Astrid isn't secretive at all!

01:08:02.312 --> 01:08:05.315
No, we talk about everything,
all the time.

01:08:07.284 --> 01:08:10.254
We just love her.

01:08:10.254 --> 01:08:11.855
She's doing so well.

01:08:13.123 --> 01:08:15.359
She's on
the honor roll,

01:08:15.359 --> 01:08:16.760
and we're just working

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:19.696
to keep that old
grade point average up.

01:08:19.696 --> 01:08:21.598
Why don't you put a pyramid
over her desk?

01:08:21.598 --> 01:08:23.099
They say it improves memory.

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:24.434
My memory is fine.

01:08:24.434 --> 01:08:27.970
Pyramid.
I hadn't thought of that.

01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:30.374
I do practice Feng Shui, though.

01:08:30.374 --> 01:08:33.843
You never mentioned that
in your letters.

01:08:33.843 --> 01:08:35.312
How about your husband?

01:08:35.312 --> 01:08:36.746
Is he into Feng Shui as well?

01:08:36.746 --> 01:08:41.117
No, he's into
frequent flyer miles.

01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:45.121
He's gone half the time.

01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:47.591
That's not so bad, you know?

01:08:47.591 --> 01:08:49.826
And now that I have Astrid...

01:08:49.826 --> 01:08:55.932
She must be
a great comfort to you,

01:08:55.932 --> 01:08:58.568
not being able to have
children of your own.

01:08:59.868 --> 01:09:02.138
Yeah.

01:09:02.138 --> 01:09:03.872
She is.

01:09:07.743 --> 01:09:11.581
Would you mind letting
us talk alone, sweetie?

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:16.185
They're grown-up things.

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:19.022
Don't we have to go?

01:09:19.022 --> 01:09:21.425
No, it's okay.

01:09:21.425 --> 01:09:23.493
We have time.

01:09:42.312 --> 01:09:45.048
Love humiliates you.

01:09:45.048 --> 01:09:47.651
Hatred cradles you.

01:09:47.651 --> 01:09:49.419
It's soothing.

01:09:52.421 --> 01:09:53.957
What did you
say to her?

01:09:53.957 --> 01:09:58.562
She's having trouble
with her husband.

01:09:58.562 --> 01:10:00.730
It's not you, is it?

01:10:00.730 --> 01:10:03.267
I know you have an attraction
for older men.

01:10:03.267 --> 01:10:05.068
No, it's not me.

01:10:05.068 --> 01:10:06.603
You leave her alone.

01:10:06.603 --> 01:10:08.338
Oh, but it's such fun.

01:10:08.338 --> 01:10:10.574
Easy, but fun.

01:10:10.574 --> 01:10:12.342
And in my present situation,

01:10:12.342 --> 01:10:14.010
I have to get my fun
where I can.

01:10:14.010 --> 01:10:19.249
God, how can you stand
to live with poor Claire?

01:10:19.249 --> 01:10:21.351
Did you know there's
an entire order

01:10:21.351 --> 01:10:23.287
called the Poor Claires?

01:10:23.287 --> 01:10:26.390
She is a genuinely nice person.

01:10:28.758 --> 01:10:30.627
You don't know
what it's been like.

01:10:30.627 --> 01:10:33.963
If you love me, you'll help me.

01:10:33.963 --> 01:10:35.365
Help you?

01:10:37.867 --> 01:10:40.370
I would rather see you

01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:43.172
in the worst kind
of foster hell

01:10:43.172 --> 01:10:44.708
than living with that woman.

01:10:44.708 --> 01:10:47.977
What can you possibly
learn from her?

01:10:47.977 --> 01:10:50.314
How to pine artistically?

01:10:50.314 --> 01:10:52.982
27 names for tears?

01:10:57.954 --> 01:11:01.991
All I can say is...

01:11:01.991 --> 01:11:03.693
keep your bags packed.

01:11:07.564 --> 01:11:10.467
MARK:
I feel like a stranger
in my own goddamn house.

01:11:10.467 --> 01:11:12.068
I feel like
you two live here,

01:11:12.068 --> 01:11:14.338
and I'm allowed to stay
here once in a while.

01:11:14.338 --> 01:11:16.272
CLAIRE:
Maybe if you gave
a little bit!

01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:19.175
Again! "Why can't I give more?
"Why can't I talk more?"

01:11:19.175 --> 01:11:20.544
"Why can't I be here more?"

01:11:20.544 --> 01:11:23.179
Because I work!
Because I have a job.

01:11:23.179 --> 01:11:24.414
That's not fair.

01:11:24.414 --> 01:11:27.016
I give you
everything that you ask for,

01:11:27.016 --> 01:11:29.285
and still it's not enough.

01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:32.021
No, not everything.
Not everything.

01:11:32.021 --> 01:11:33.423
You promised,

01:11:33.423 --> 01:11:36.626
if we got another kid,
things would change.

01:11:36.626 --> 01:11:38.695
Mark, I'm trying,
you know I'm trying.

01:11:38.695 --> 01:11:40.029
Trying is not good enough.

01:11:40.029 --> 01:11:41.398
You are
falling apart again.

01:11:41.398 --> 01:11:42.899
We are right back
to where we started.

01:11:42.899 --> 01:11:44.568
Yes we are.
It is not working out,

01:11:44.568 --> 01:11:46.302
and I think
we should send her back.

01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:51.007
You can't just
send her back.

01:11:51.007 --> 01:11:52.876
Where's she going to go?

01:11:52.876 --> 01:11:54.511
They'll find
some place for her.

01:11:54.511 --> 01:11:56.480
I can't believe it. You're
just going to send her away?

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:58.448
You take everything away,
don't you?

01:11:58.448 --> 01:12:00.984
You just leave me here
with nothing.

01:12:00.984 --> 01:12:03.420
Jesus Christ,
you are such a bad actress.

01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:06.456
I really almost forgot.

01:12:06.456 --> 01:12:10.159
Okay, okay.

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:13.162
I'll do what you say.
I'll send her back.

01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:15.198
Okay? We can try that.

01:12:15.198 --> 01:12:16.466
Just don't go, okay?

01:12:16.466 --> 01:12:17.801
Just don't leave me.

01:12:17.801 --> 01:12:20.470
Unlike you, Claire,
I work, remember?

01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:23.473
Mm-hm. And...

01:12:23.473 --> 01:12:26.776
is she going with you,
your girlfriend?

01:12:26.776 --> 01:12:29.212
I've had it
with this, Claire.

01:12:29.212 --> 01:12:30.947
I've really had it.

01:12:36.886 --> 01:12:39.088
Astrid?

01:12:57.507 --> 01:12:59.476
Astrid...

01:13:04.914 --> 01:13:07.116
Astrid, please.

01:13:42.986 --> 01:13:44.621
Claire?

01:13:46.690 --> 01:13:49.025
Are you awake?

01:14:02.572 --> 01:14:04.508
I'm sorry.

01:14:06.175 --> 01:14:07.544
Are you all right?

01:14:09.412 --> 01:14:11.014
Yeah.

01:14:12.482 --> 01:14:14.484
Take my advice.

01:14:14.484 --> 01:14:17.987
Stay away from broken people.

01:14:20.256 --> 01:14:21.825
You can't send me back.

01:14:23.359 --> 01:14:25.228
He's not coming back, Astrid.

01:14:27.664 --> 01:14:30.634
He's going
to divorce me.

01:14:30.634 --> 01:14:33.236
You know, Claire...

01:14:33.236 --> 01:14:35.004
it wouldn't be the worst thing.

01:14:41.911 --> 01:14:43.580
I'm cold.

01:14:47.083 --> 01:14:49.553
Cold.

01:14:49.553 --> 01:14:53.122
Get in here with me.

01:14:53.122 --> 01:14:55.224
Come on.

01:15:05.368 --> 01:15:07.203
Stay with me, okay?

01:15:12.408 --> 01:15:15.244
Stay with me, please.

01:15:29.225 --> 01:15:31.260
Claire...

01:15:34.998 --> 01:15:37.266
Claire?

01:15:50.647 --> 01:15:51.815
Claire!

01:15:51.815 --> 01:15:56.285
Claire... Claire!

01:15:56.285 --> 01:15:58.487
Claire, wake up!

01:15:58.487 --> 01:16:01.290
Claire, please!

01:16:03.492 --> 01:16:04.628
God!

01:16:04.628 --> 01:16:06.896
No!

01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:15.304
Claire, please!

01:16:18.041 --> 01:16:19.843
No!

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:43.633
Astrid.

01:17:08.524 --> 01:17:09.959
What is it?

01:17:09.959 --> 01:17:12.428
I'm back in Mac.
Didn't they tell you?

01:17:12.428 --> 01:17:14.463
No.

01:17:14.463 --> 01:17:16.900
Claire is dead.

01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:18.334
She killed herself.

01:17:18.334 --> 01:17:21.370
I'm sorry.

01:17:21.370 --> 01:17:22.839
No, you're not.

01:17:22.839 --> 01:17:27.176
You poisoned her, too,
only this time you used words.

01:17:27.176 --> 01:17:29.713
I told her
what she already knew.

01:17:29.713 --> 01:17:31.514
You were just jealous.

01:17:31.514 --> 01:17:34.083
Of course I was jealous.

01:17:34.083 --> 01:17:35.919
I live in a cell with a woman

01:17:35.919 --> 01:17:39.288
who has a vocabulary
of 25 words.

01:17:41.925 --> 01:17:43.893
Why do you think
they got you, Astrid?

01:17:43.893 --> 01:17:45.995
To create
a perfect little family?

01:17:45.995 --> 01:17:48.031
People get babies for that.

01:17:48.031 --> 01:17:50.633
Not teenagers
recovering from bullet wounds.

01:17:50.633 --> 01:17:52.168
You were on suicide watch.

01:17:52.168 --> 01:17:54.337
And don't think this was the
first time she tried it, either.

01:17:54.337 --> 01:17:57.874
It's just the first time
she pulled it off.

01:17:57.874 --> 01:18:00.910
I'm not coming back.

01:18:02.311 --> 01:18:04.347
I wanted to tell you
that in person.

01:18:04.347 --> 01:18:07.416
I'm going to leave you
in here, alone.

01:18:11.554 --> 01:18:14.357
I know you think I'm cruel.

01:18:14.357 --> 01:18:16.325
I'm only trying to protect you
from those people.

01:18:16.325 --> 01:18:18.627
Those people are not the enemy,
Mother.

01:18:18.627 --> 01:18:19.829
We are.

01:18:19.829 --> 01:18:21.197
You and me.

01:18:21.197 --> 01:18:25.969
They don't hurt us.
We hurt them.

01:18:42.285 --> 01:18:44.453
You still ignoring me?

01:18:50.326 --> 01:18:52.328
I turn 18 Saturday.

01:18:52.328 --> 01:18:54.430
I'm going to New York.

01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:56.833
I want you
to come with me.

01:18:56.833 --> 01:18:58.868
I can't.

01:18:58.868 --> 01:19:01.470
Sure you can.
Just leave.

01:19:16.385 --> 01:19:18.487
Is it your mother?

01:19:26.863 --> 01:19:28.497
Come on.

01:19:28.497 --> 01:19:29.899
I'll get a job.

01:19:29.899 --> 01:19:31.300
We'll find
a place to live.

01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:33.302
We'll be like
we always talked about.

01:19:33.302 --> 01:19:35.872
I don't want
to go to New York.

01:19:35.872 --> 01:19:39.108
I don't want
to be with you.

01:20:11.941 --> 01:20:13.342
She was with us
for three years,

01:20:13.342 --> 01:20:15.278
but her birth parents
took her back.

01:20:15.278 --> 01:20:17.346
We think you'd really
like it with us, Astrid.

01:20:17.346 --> 01:20:20.049
There are kids your age
in our neighborhood.

01:20:26.822 --> 01:20:28.457
Excuse me.

01:20:32.495 --> 01:20:33.829
Don't worry about it.

01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:37.700
She's had a very
hard time recently.

01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:40.569
Let me just talk to her, okay?

01:20:46.775 --> 01:20:49.445
So, what's wrong
this time?

01:20:49.445 --> 01:20:52.115
I'm too old for them.

01:20:56.185 --> 01:20:58.387
Look, the Greenways are great.

01:20:58.387 --> 01:21:00.623
They've been doing this
for years.

01:21:00.623 --> 01:21:03.726
They've got a nice house
with an extra bedroom for you.

01:21:03.726 --> 01:21:05.594
They go to church.

01:21:05.594 --> 01:21:07.696
Schools are good.

01:21:07.696 --> 01:21:09.265
They don't smoke.

01:21:10.666 --> 01:21:12.601
He makes
his own beer.

01:21:14.603 --> 01:21:16.339
I want her.

01:21:27.116 --> 01:21:30.954
Workers
of the world, arise.

01:21:32.621 --> 01:21:34.357
You've got nothing to lose

01:21:34.357 --> 01:21:39.628
but VISA card, Happy Meal,
and Kotex with wings.

01:21:42.031 --> 01:21:44.233
Christ, Thursday.

01:21:53.176 --> 01:21:55.844
You, lazy bones.
You want smoke?

01:21:55.844 --> 01:21:58.147
I quit for the baby, Rena.

01:21:58.147 --> 01:22:00.016
Why? You don't keep it,
thank God.

01:22:02.618 --> 01:22:05.454
You, cheerleader.
You want smoke?

01:22:05.454 --> 01:22:08.457
Russian cigarettes.
No cancer.

01:22:29.378 --> 01:22:30.446
Clothes.

01:22:37.486 --> 01:22:40.689
Really nice.
It was never worn.

01:22:40.689 --> 01:22:42.558
What is this made of?

01:22:42.558 --> 01:22:43.859
I don't know.

01:22:43.859 --> 01:22:47.496
Why don't you just try it on
and see how it looks?

01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:52.835
Hey.

01:22:52.835 --> 01:22:54.837
That's my dress.

01:22:54.837 --> 01:22:56.105
These are all mine.

01:22:56.105 --> 01:22:57.640
So? You get
good price for them.

01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:01.244
What do you need
expensive clothes for, huh?

01:23:01.244 --> 01:23:03.312
Maybe Melrose Place
call you to be a star.

01:23:03.312 --> 01:23:05.381
Someone gave them to me.

01:23:05.381 --> 01:23:07.016
Even better. All profit.

01:23:07.016 --> 01:23:08.351
That's why I love this country.

01:23:08.351 --> 01:23:10.586
Because it loves money
like I love money.

01:23:10.586 --> 01:23:14.723
Hey. You make a price,
I take 25%.

01:23:14.723 --> 01:23:16.292
No.

01:23:16.292 --> 01:23:18.727
What, you think you're going
to sell it all by yourself

01:23:18.727 --> 01:23:20.196
on the street corner?

01:23:20.196 --> 01:23:23.866
I pay for stall,
storage, gas.

01:23:23.866 --> 01:23:25.334
They pay you, you pay me.

01:23:25.334 --> 01:23:27.870
You still make profit.

01:23:27.870 --> 01:23:32.141
Dead person who
give you thing don't care.

01:23:32.141 --> 01:23:34.177
The past is gone.

01:23:34.177 --> 01:23:36.745
Sentimental is stupid.

01:23:36.745 --> 01:23:38.614
It's smart to make money.

01:23:40.049 --> 01:23:41.084
There's no price.

01:23:41.084 --> 01:23:44.153
How about 20 dollars?

01:23:44.153 --> 01:23:45.154
It's a Marc Jacobs dress.

01:23:45.154 --> 01:23:46.822
It's only been worn once.

01:23:46.822 --> 01:23:48.691
50?

01:23:48.691 --> 01:23:50.459
100.

01:23:54.497 --> 01:23:55.498
Thank you.

01:24:00.303 --> 01:24:01.570
How was last night?

01:24:01.570 --> 01:24:03.639
It was fun.

01:24:03.639 --> 01:24:04.773
What did you do?

01:24:04.773 --> 01:24:06.575
Watched TV.

01:24:06.575 --> 01:24:11.647
You know who I saw?
I saw Dan.

01:24:11.647 --> 01:24:15.518
Don't you think
Astrid would like him?

01:24:15.518 --> 01:24:17.920
Astrid?

01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:20.123
I'm Hannah.

01:24:20.123 --> 01:24:22.658
This is Julie.

01:24:22.658 --> 01:24:23.759
We went to your house,

01:24:23.759 --> 01:24:26.629
but the Russian lady
said you'd be here, so...

01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:28.731
We visit your mother.

01:24:28.731 --> 01:24:31.066
She's our project
in Women's Studies.

01:24:31.066 --> 01:24:34.203
What does she want?

01:24:34.203 --> 01:24:36.004
Oh, no, she didn't send us.

01:24:36.004 --> 01:24:38.607
We came on our own.

01:24:38.607 --> 01:24:40.943
She asked us to mail you
a copy of the interview.

01:24:40.943 --> 01:24:42.411
Her show at Bergamot?

01:24:42.411 --> 01:24:45.814
But then we thought that
we could deliver it ourselves--

01:24:45.814 --> 01:24:47.082
Is that it?

01:24:47.082 --> 01:24:49.318
Yeah.

01:24:56.225 --> 01:24:57.926
What do you talk about?

01:24:57.926 --> 01:24:59.228
All kinds of things.

01:24:59.228 --> 01:25:00.829
Art, music....

01:25:00.829 --> 01:25:02.831
HANNAH:
She talks about you.

01:25:02.831 --> 01:25:04.233
Really?

01:25:06.735 --> 01:25:08.371
What does she say?

01:25:08.371 --> 01:25:10.839
That you're in a...

01:25:10.839 --> 01:25:12.441
You know, fostered.

01:25:15.344 --> 01:25:18.247
Look, she feels really terrible
about what's happened.

01:25:18.247 --> 01:25:21.317
So you thought you'd come out
and what?

01:25:21.317 --> 01:25:22.818
Adopt me?

01:25:25.754 --> 01:25:28.324
You don't think
she killed him, do you?

01:25:30.125 --> 01:25:32.595
Something you should know.

01:25:32.595 --> 01:25:33.862
She did.

01:25:33.862 --> 01:25:35.198
I was there.

01:25:38.201 --> 01:25:40.303
MAN: Oleander is poisonous.

01:25:40.303 --> 01:25:41.937
I don't know why people grow it.

01:25:42.905 --> 01:25:44.907
Open the door!

01:25:47.109 --> 01:25:48.043
They can't keep me!

01:25:48.043 --> 01:25:49.678
I'll be back in an hour!

01:26:36.892 --> 01:26:39.328
Who is that?

01:26:39.328 --> 01:26:41.330
I don't know.

01:26:41.330 --> 01:26:42.531
You draw her all the time.

01:26:42.531 --> 01:26:45.601
I think
her name was Annie.

01:26:45.601 --> 01:26:47.236
She's someone
I remember.

01:26:47.236 --> 01:26:49.538
I don't know
who she was.

01:26:53.242 --> 01:26:54.543
Check it out, you guys.

01:26:56.879 --> 01:26:58.447
Rodeo Drive refugee.

01:26:58.447 --> 01:27:00.949
Excuse me.
Are you Rena Gruschenko?

01:27:00.949 --> 01:27:02.285
Gruschenka.

01:27:02.285 --> 01:27:04.687
If you come from I.N.S.,
I have a green card.

01:27:04.687 --> 01:27:08.957
I've been all over this junkyard
looking for you.

01:27:11.026 --> 01:27:12.628
You must be Astrid.

01:27:12.628 --> 01:27:15.331
I'm Susan Valeris,
your mother's lawyer?

01:27:19.101 --> 01:27:21.570
Cigarette?

01:27:23.772 --> 01:27:26.241
Don't know why I never
got around to quitting.

01:27:26.241 --> 01:27:27.910
I do.
All the prisoners smoke.

01:27:27.910 --> 01:27:29.244
You can offer them one.

01:27:29.244 --> 01:27:32.415
Your mother is very proud of you
for not quitting school.

01:27:32.415 --> 01:27:34.249
You graduate soon, don't you?

01:27:34.249 --> 01:27:37.986
Are you making any plans
for your future?

01:27:37.986 --> 01:27:39.322
Yeah.

01:27:39.322 --> 01:27:41.724
I thought
I'd be a criminal lawyer.

01:27:41.724 --> 01:27:43.392
Really?

01:27:43.392 --> 01:27:44.960
Either that,
or a hooker,

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:47.396
or a garbage collector.

01:27:47.396 --> 01:27:49.532
Your mother
said you'd be difficult.

01:27:49.532 --> 01:27:51.934
Mother knows best.

01:27:51.934 --> 01:27:55.771
I know you've been through
a terrible ordeal.

01:27:55.771 --> 01:27:58.006
Three foster homes
in three years,

01:27:58.006 --> 01:27:59.074
a shooting,

01:27:59.074 --> 01:28:00.476
the suicide
of a foster mother.

01:28:00.476 --> 01:28:01.944
I understand
you were very close.

01:28:01.944 --> 01:28:05.280
Did you ask your client
about her involvement with that?

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:06.815
You can't possibly blame her

01:28:06.815 --> 01:28:09.385
for the death of a woman
she only met once.

01:28:09.385 --> 01:28:12.655
But I do blame her, Susan.

01:28:12.655 --> 01:28:14.923
That's pretty cynical, Astrid.

01:28:14.923 --> 01:28:18.894
You want me to lie for her
in court, is that it?

01:28:21.263 --> 01:28:22.765
Why do you hate her, Astrid?

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.803
Is it because you think
she committed murder?

01:28:27.803 --> 01:28:30.172
Or because
you feel abandoned?

01:28:30.172 --> 01:28:32.140
Talk to her.

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:33.376
People do change.

01:28:35.444 --> 01:28:37.580
You should hear
the way she talks about you.

01:28:37.580 --> 01:28:40.949
She worries about you.

01:28:40.949 --> 01:28:43.919
She asked me to find out
if there's anything you need.

01:28:43.919 --> 01:28:45.020
Money for college?

01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:47.055
Car?

01:28:47.055 --> 01:28:48.457
There's money
behind her.

01:28:48.457 --> 01:28:51.860
Just tell me
what you want.

01:29:23.626 --> 01:29:26.028
You are stupid girl.

01:29:26.028 --> 01:29:31.567
You walk away from money
to punish mother.

01:29:31.567 --> 01:29:33.368
You want car?

01:29:33.368 --> 01:29:36.472
You want art college?

01:29:36.472 --> 01:29:37.840
All costs money.

01:29:39.908 --> 01:29:42.511
You don't know anything
about this, Rena,

01:29:42.511 --> 01:29:44.947
so just stay out of it.

01:29:49.384 --> 01:29:51.119
I have plan for you, anyway.

01:29:51.119 --> 01:29:53.121
Oh, yeah

01:29:53.121 --> 01:29:54.757
Niki leave soon.

01:29:54.757 --> 01:29:59.194
And Yvonne is stupid girl.

01:29:59.194 --> 01:30:01.930
Making third baby.

01:30:01.930 --> 01:30:03.532
Every time
she look at the window

01:30:03.532 --> 01:30:05.200
to see baby's face,

01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:06.469
baby gone,

01:30:06.469 --> 01:30:08.837
then she cries
like it's a big surprise.

01:30:11.607 --> 01:30:12.575
But you...

01:30:12.575 --> 01:30:14.543
you're a special girl.

01:30:18.013 --> 01:30:19.682
You stay...

01:30:19.682 --> 01:30:20.949
I make you partner.

01:30:20.949 --> 01:30:23.218
Stay here?

01:30:23.218 --> 01:30:26.955
You got better place to go?

01:30:34.162 --> 01:30:35.598
Then go see mother.

01:30:36.599 --> 01:30:37.966
She needs
something from you,

01:30:37.966 --> 01:30:39.535
you need
something from her.

01:30:39.535 --> 01:30:41.604
Go get it.

01:30:47.109 --> 01:30:48.911
Here she comes.

01:30:57.586 --> 01:30:59.387
Astrid, my God.

01:30:59.387 --> 01:31:00.589
What's wrong, Mom?

01:31:00.589 --> 01:31:02.157
You don't like my outfit?

01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:08.196
I'll leave you two alone
for a while.

01:31:20.609 --> 01:31:22.144
So what's the story?

01:31:22.144 --> 01:31:25.714
We didn't go to Mexico
to buy DMSO?

01:31:25.714 --> 01:31:27.516
Barry beat you?

01:31:27.516 --> 01:31:30.352
He raped me?

01:31:30.352 --> 01:31:33.021
How bad does he have to be
to get you out of jail?

01:31:33.021 --> 01:31:35.157
I can't believe
what's happened to you.

01:31:35.157 --> 01:31:37.359
When I get out,
I'll make it up to you.

01:31:37.359 --> 01:31:39.361
Who said you're getting out?

01:31:39.361 --> 01:31:41.496
I said I'd talk to you.

01:31:41.496 --> 01:31:43.365
I didn't say I'd do it.

01:31:43.365 --> 01:31:46.468
Then what do you want?

01:31:46.468 --> 01:31:49.104
I have a deal to make.

01:31:49.104 --> 01:31:51.506
A trade.

01:31:51.506 --> 01:31:55.377
You tell me the truth...

01:31:55.377 --> 01:31:57.145
I'll lie for you in court.

01:31:58.647 --> 01:32:00.583
The truth about what?

01:32:00.583 --> 01:32:03.251
Everything you kept from me.

01:32:03.251 --> 01:32:04.920
And if I don't?

01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:06.589
Then you can rot in here.

01:32:08.023 --> 01:32:09.725
I hate this look, by the way.

01:32:10.793 --> 01:32:14.797
You're a Sunset
Boulevard motel,

01:32:14.797 --> 01:32:16.865
a $20 hooker
in the back of a car.

01:32:21.236 --> 01:32:22.738
Why did you murder Barry?

01:32:25.574 --> 01:32:27.610
If I submit to this,
you'll testify?

01:32:27.610 --> 01:32:30.679
Yes.

01:32:33.081 --> 01:32:36.885
Self-defense.
He was killing me.

01:32:36.885 --> 01:32:39.287
Claire didn't do anything
to you.

01:32:39.287 --> 01:32:40.689
Why did you go after her?

01:32:40.689 --> 01:32:42.825
Claire
went after herself.

01:32:42.825 --> 01:32:46.194
I just showed her how to do it.

01:32:48.563 --> 01:32:50.766
Who was my father?

01:32:53.001 --> 01:32:55.303
Your father?
Why do you always ask that?

01:32:55.303 --> 01:32:56.805
It's ancient history.

01:32:56.805 --> 01:32:59.041
It's my ancient history.
Who was he?

01:32:59.041 --> 01:33:02.711
His name was Klaus Anders.

01:33:02.711 --> 01:33:04.312
What did he do?

01:33:04.312 --> 01:33:07.249
He was an artist.

01:33:07.249 --> 01:33:09.718
How did you meet?

01:33:09.718 --> 01:33:12.688
At Venice Beach at a party.

01:33:12.688 --> 01:33:14.556
He had the drugs.

01:33:14.556 --> 01:33:17.559
Did you love him?

01:33:17.559 --> 01:33:20.328
It was a long time ago.

01:33:20.328 --> 01:33:22.264
I'm not the same person.

01:33:22.264 --> 01:33:25.333
Liar.
You're exactly the same.

01:33:25.333 --> 01:33:27.202
Answer the question.

01:33:27.202 --> 01:33:28.737
You're such a child.

01:33:28.737 --> 01:33:30.739
You've taken my propaganda
for truth.

01:33:30.739 --> 01:33:32.574
So set me straight.

01:33:32.574 --> 01:33:33.942
Did you love him?

01:33:37.612 --> 01:33:40.015
We had
a very sexual relationship.

01:33:40.015 --> 01:33:41.884
One overlooks many things.

01:33:41.884 --> 01:33:43.085
You worshipped him.

01:33:43.085 --> 01:33:44.586
I read it in your journal.

01:33:44.586 --> 01:33:45.754
"Worship" isn't exactly

01:33:45.754 --> 01:33:50.225
the word
we're looking for here.

01:33:50.225 --> 01:33:51.226
Who was Annie?

01:33:53.228 --> 01:33:54.496
What?

01:33:54.496 --> 01:33:56.231
Who was Annie, Mother?

01:34:02.037 --> 01:34:03.772
She was a neighbor
who took in kids,

01:34:03.772 --> 01:34:05.340
did people's laundry.

01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:08.510
What did she look like?

01:34:08.510 --> 01:34:12.981
Dark, curly hair, freckles.

01:34:12.981 --> 01:34:16.184
Did she take care of me?

01:34:23.759 --> 01:34:26.261
How could you possibly
have remembered this?

01:34:33.802 --> 01:34:35.437
It will only hurt you.

01:34:41.744 --> 01:34:44.947
Imagine my life for a moment...

01:34:44.947 --> 01:34:46.949
how unprepared I was

01:34:46.949 --> 01:34:51.086
to be the mother
of a small child.

01:34:51.086 --> 01:34:53.655
I was used to
having time to think,

01:34:53.655 --> 01:34:55.891
and you just wanted,
wanted, wanted.

01:34:58.827 --> 01:35:01.296
I felt like a hostage.

01:35:01.296 --> 01:35:03.465
Can you understand
how desperate I was?

01:35:18.513 --> 01:35:21.850
I dropped you off
at her house one afternoon

01:35:21.850 --> 01:35:27.022
to go to the beach
with some friends.

01:35:27.022 --> 01:35:31.126
And one thing led to another.

01:35:31.126 --> 01:35:33.728
They had a place
in Ensenada.

01:35:33.728 --> 01:35:36.865
It was wonderful.

01:35:36.865 --> 01:35:38.733
You can't imagine...

01:35:38.733 --> 01:35:42.737
To take a nap
in the afternoon...

01:35:42.737 --> 01:35:46.074
to make love all day if I wanted

01:35:46.074 --> 01:35:47.910
and not have to think,
"What's Astrid doing?

01:35:47.910 --> 01:35:49.377
Where's Astrid?"

01:35:49.377 --> 01:35:51.980
"Mommy, Mommy, Mommy,"
clinging to me like a spider.

01:35:51.980 --> 01:35:54.983
At the end of it,

01:35:54.983 --> 01:35:58.486
I just wanted
to throw you against a wall.

01:36:03.525 --> 01:36:07.362
How long were you gone?

01:36:08.831 --> 01:36:11.099
About a year.

01:36:11.099 --> 01:36:13.035
Give or take a few months.

01:36:15.103 --> 01:36:16.304
My God.

01:36:16.304 --> 01:36:18.440
But you're not asking
the right question.

01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:21.376
Don't ask me why I left.

01:36:21.376 --> 01:36:23.778
Ask me why I came back.

01:36:23.778 --> 01:36:25.513
You should have been sterilized.

01:36:25.513 --> 01:36:26.915
I could have
left you there,

01:36:26.915 --> 01:36:28.116
but I didn't.

01:36:28.116 --> 01:36:30.518
Don't you understand?

01:36:30.518 --> 01:36:34.923
For once, I did the right thing.

01:36:34.923 --> 01:36:36.724
When I came back, you knew me.

01:36:36.724 --> 01:36:39.061
You were
sitting by the door,

01:36:39.061 --> 01:36:40.929
and you looked up...

01:36:40.929 --> 01:36:42.597
and you reached for me.

01:36:42.597 --> 01:36:46.801
It was as if you had been
waiting for me all along.

01:36:46.801 --> 01:36:48.403
I was always waiting
for you, Mother.

01:36:48.403 --> 01:36:52.407
That's the constant in my life.
Waiting for you.

01:36:52.407 --> 01:36:53.675
Will you come back?

01:36:53.675 --> 01:36:56.678
Will you forget you tied me up
in front of the store

01:36:56.678 --> 01:36:58.680
or left me on a bus?

01:36:58.680 --> 01:36:59.915
Are you still waiting?

01:36:59.915 --> 01:37:02.217
No.

01:37:02.217 --> 01:37:05.954
I stopped when Claire showed me
what it felt like to be loved.

01:37:05.954 --> 01:37:08.924
What did you think?

01:37:08.924 --> 01:37:10.492
That I would amuse you?

01:37:10.492 --> 01:37:13.095
That's what babies are like,
Mother.

01:37:13.095 --> 01:37:14.529
What did you think?

01:37:14.529 --> 01:37:16.298
That we'd exchange thoughts
on Joseph Brodsky?

01:37:16.298 --> 01:37:19.101
I thought Klaus and I
would live happily ever after.

01:37:19.101 --> 01:37:21.937
Adam and Eve
in a vine-covered shack.

01:37:21.937 --> 01:37:23.671
I must have been out of my mind.

01:37:23.671 --> 01:37:24.973
You were in love with him.

01:37:24.973 --> 01:37:26.808
Yes, I was in love with him,
all right?

01:37:26.808 --> 01:37:28.076
I was in love with him,

01:37:28.076 --> 01:37:30.212
"baby makes three"
and all that crap.

01:37:30.212 --> 01:37:32.180
Then why did you leave him?

01:37:33.315 --> 01:37:35.650
Why did you leave him?
I didn't leave him.

01:37:35.650 --> 01:37:37.619
He left me.

01:37:40.855 --> 01:37:42.991
You want to know
about your father?

01:37:42.991 --> 01:37:44.993
He left us
when you were six months old

01:37:44.993 --> 01:37:46.128
for another woman.

01:37:46.128 --> 01:37:47.795
I never saw him again

01:37:47.795 --> 01:37:49.531
until he showed up
looking for you

01:37:49.531 --> 01:37:52.000
when you were 8 years old.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.068
He came to see me?

01:37:53.068 --> 01:37:54.336
Yes, he came to see you,

01:37:54.336 --> 01:37:57.139
but it was a little late,
wasn't it?

01:37:57.139 --> 01:37:59.807
Why should I let him see you
after what he did to me?

01:37:59.807 --> 01:38:02.077
Because it wasn't about you!

01:38:02.077 --> 01:38:04.412
It was about me,
and I wanted to see him!

01:38:04.412 --> 01:38:07.215
My whole life,
I've wanted to see him.

01:38:07.215 --> 01:38:09.284
That decision was mine,
not yours!

01:38:09.284 --> 01:38:13.388
Everything has always been
about you, never about me.

01:38:13.388 --> 01:38:17.259
I knew
you were going to kill Barry,

01:38:17.259 --> 01:38:19.294
but you didn't even care.

01:38:19.294 --> 01:38:23.431
You didn't give a damn
about what that would do to me.

01:38:23.431 --> 01:38:25.968
I'll say
whatever Susan wants me to say,

01:38:25.968 --> 01:38:28.003
but I've got to get out of here.

01:38:28.003 --> 01:38:30.038
No. You don't just walk away
from me.

01:38:30.038 --> 01:38:31.106
I made you.

01:38:31.106 --> 01:38:33.375
I'm in your blood.

01:38:33.375 --> 01:38:35.910
You don't go anywhere
until I let you go.

01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:38.646
Then let me go.

01:38:44.586 --> 01:38:46.788
You look at me...

01:38:46.788 --> 01:38:50.325
and you don't like what you see.

01:38:50.325 --> 01:38:55.130
But this is the price, Mother.
The price of belonging to you.

01:38:55.130 --> 01:38:59.667
If I could,
I'd take it all back.

01:38:59.667 --> 01:39:01.103
I would.

01:39:04.306 --> 01:39:06.674
Then tell me
you don't want me to testify.

01:39:08.943 --> 01:39:11.213
Tell me
you don't want me like this.

01:39:16.751 --> 01:39:19.321
Tell me you would sacrifice
the rest of your life

01:39:19.321 --> 01:39:23.691
to have me back
the way I was.

01:39:35.403 --> 01:39:38.106
Listen, forget it.
A deal's a deal.

01:39:38.106 --> 01:39:41.976
Let's leave it at that.

01:40:04.566 --> 01:40:05.667
Excuse me.

01:40:05.667 --> 01:40:07.535
It's probably a waste of time,
but...

01:40:07.535 --> 01:40:10.605
I'm looking for someone
who used to come in here?

01:40:10.605 --> 01:40:12.740
His name is Paul Trout.

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:13.741
You Astrid?

01:40:13.741 --> 01:40:14.742
Yeah.

01:40:25.187 --> 01:40:28.190
He said you'd turn up.

01:40:31.726 --> 01:40:33.628
Thanks.

01:42:01.749 --> 01:42:03.918
What's going on?

01:42:03.918 --> 01:42:05.887
I don't know.

01:42:12.327 --> 01:42:14.095
Excuse me.
Is it a recess?

01:42:14.095 --> 01:42:17.131
No. Jury's out.

01:42:30.678 --> 01:42:32.914
Don't you need me to testify?

01:42:32.914 --> 01:42:37.319
Your mother told me
to leave you alone.

01:43:29.136 --> 01:43:30.905
What happened?

01:43:34.075 --> 01:43:35.943
She let me go.

01:43:54.128 --> 01:43:56.631
ASTRID:
Two years after Paul and I
moved to New York,

01:43:56.631 --> 01:43:59.834
I received a letter
from my mother.

01:43:59.834 --> 01:44:03.971
In it was a copy of
the Los Angeles Times Magazine,

01:44:03.971 --> 01:44:06.641
my mother on the cover.

01:44:06.641 --> 01:44:08.643
A Santa Monica gallery

01:44:08.643 --> 01:44:10.712
had mounted
a showing of her work.

01:44:10.712 --> 01:44:12.414
The Times included

01:44:12.414 --> 01:44:13.915
seven pages

01:44:13.915 --> 01:44:18.386
of her hauntingly distant
prison collages.

01:44:18.386 --> 01:44:20.988
She stares out
from the cover...

01:44:20.988 --> 01:44:24.959
the bars of her cell
behind her.

01:44:24.959 --> 01:44:26.928
Beautiful.

01:44:26.928 --> 01:44:29.130
Dangerous.

01:44:29.130 --> 01:44:32.266
Proud.

01:44:32.266 --> 01:44:33.968
The Times said her lawyer

01:44:33.968 --> 01:44:37.739
was close to winning a retrial
after a first failed appeal.

01:44:37.739 --> 01:44:41.008
They called her show a triumph.

01:44:44.812 --> 01:44:46.414
It's too much

01:44:46.414 --> 01:44:48.082
to imagine
her tempering her joy

01:44:48.082 --> 01:44:50.117
with a moment of grief...

01:44:50.117 --> 01:44:55.089
a moment
for what that triumph had cost.

01:44:55.089 --> 01:44:59.093
These suitcases
are a map of that country...

01:44:59.093 --> 01:45:02.330
a terrible country
I will never revisit.

01:45:07.134 --> 01:45:12.407
Even so,
I find myself thinking of her,

01:45:14.308 --> 01:45:16.444
wanting to feel that wind.

01:45:19.313 --> 01:45:21.983
It's a secret wanting...

01:45:21.983 --> 01:45:25.052
like a song
I can't stop humming,

01:45:25.052 --> 01:45:27.989
or loving someone
you can never have.

01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:35.530
No matter how much
she's damaged me...

01:45:37.632 --> 01:45:41.603
no matter how flawed she is...

01:45:41.603 --> 01:45:44.071
I know my mother loves me.

01:45:49.977 --> 01:45:52.547
