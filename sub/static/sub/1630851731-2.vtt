WEBVTT

00:03.570 --> 00:05.437
- Right here!

00:05.473 --> 00:08.039
- Alessandro! Over here!

00:09.910 --> 00:11.643
- One more!

00:13.147 --> 00:14.947
- Thank you.

00:14.949 --> 00:17.182
Now could I have one
without the girl?

00:17.218 --> 00:20.185
- The name is Frankie.
Frankie Drake.
- Good for you.

00:20.221 --> 00:21.987
So can I have one
without the Frankie?

00:22.122 --> 00:24.322
- No, not if you're
going to be rude.

00:24.358 --> 00:25.991
- It's okay. I don't mind.

00:25.993 --> 00:28.394
- Are you sure?
- Of course. Enjoy your moment.

00:31.665 --> 00:33.465
- Right here, please, please!

00:33.600 --> 00:36.168
- Big smile, big smile.

00:36.303 --> 00:38.603
- Thank you!
- Thank you very much,

00:38.672 --> 00:41.273
Alessandro, and can I just say
how pleased we are

00:41.342 --> 00:44.443
to have you here in Canada.
Will you be staying long?

00:44.445 --> 00:46.878
- Well, that depends.
But, right now,

00:46.947 --> 00:49.013
I see no reason
to leave.

00:55.022 --> 00:56.721
(jazz music)

00:56.791 --> 00:57.823
- Sorry we're late.

00:57.825 --> 01:00.425
Alessandro had to stop
for some fans.

01:00.494 --> 01:02.427
It really is wearing sometimes.

01:02.430 --> 01:05.364
- You don't need to pretend like
you're annoyed. You like it!

01:05.499 --> 01:07.432
Admit it.
- Maybe a little.

01:07.468 --> 01:09.301
- I feel the same way
being around you.

01:09.370 --> 01:13.238
But tonight, I am only
an escort. I must leave.

01:13.307 --> 01:15.373
- Well, I will see you soon.

01:20.848 --> 01:22.714
He's gotta go meet
his girlfriend.

01:23.684 --> 01:26.051
His car!
- Oh!
(laughing)

01:26.053 --> 01:28.520
- I don't mind being
the other woman.

01:28.522 --> 01:31.823
For now.
(sighing)

01:31.859 --> 01:35.260
So what's going on with you
and Bill? Are you ready
to settle in Ottawa?

01:35.395 --> 01:37.262
- That's what he wants.

01:37.331 --> 01:40.532
And he had a great job offer.
And I can't see being married

01:40.534 --> 01:42.667
and living in a different city
from my husband.

01:42.703 --> 01:45.270
- Ottawa's not that far.
- I guess.

01:46.574 --> 01:49.007
Thing is, I want to make
something of myself here.

01:49.009 --> 01:50.876
- You have.
- Maybe.

01:50.878 --> 01:53.411
I want to do even more,
you know? Not just for me,

01:53.447 --> 01:55.613
but for my family and--
- I think I'd remember.

01:55.649 --> 01:57.616
- He was here last night.
- If you say so.

01:57.685 --> 02:01.153
- He was here last night.
Where is he?
- Leave me be.

02:01.155 --> 02:04.957
- I am asking you a question
and I demand an answer!

02:04.959 --> 02:07.693
- Demand all you want.
I says I don't know the guy.

02:07.695 --> 02:10.496
That answer enough for ya?
- I don't believe you!

02:10.631 --> 02:12.898
- Get your hands off of me, pal.
- That's enough!

02:12.967 --> 02:15.033
- Who are you?
- Security.
You're not wanted here!

02:15.035 --> 02:17.236
- Wha...? You! Unhand me.

02:17.238 --> 02:20.038
- We will once you're outside.

02:22.443 --> 02:24.509
Go home.
- I will not.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.612
- Well, you're not
going back in there.
- And who is telling me this?

02:26.747 --> 02:30.449
- Friends of the owner.
- You have to let me back in.
I'm trying to find the Prince.

02:30.584 --> 02:32.584
- The Prince?
- Prince Pavel.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.853
I need to find him.
He's gone missing.

02:34.922 --> 02:37.922
(theme music)

02:39.860 --> 02:42.861
(woman scatting)

03:02.950 --> 03:05.951
- And who are you exactly?
- You have the pleasure

03:05.953 --> 03:08.353
of addressing Count Grigore
of the House of Dragos.

03:08.488 --> 03:11.022
- Wow! Aren't we lucky.

03:11.091 --> 03:13.091
- Who, exactly, is Prince Pavel?

03:13.160 --> 03:15.360
- He's the eldest son
of the king.
- Okay.

03:15.396 --> 03:18.363
- Of the Kingdom of Romania.
- I see.

03:18.498 --> 03:20.632
And why exactly
is he in Toronto?

03:20.668 --> 03:24.369
- That I cannot tell you.
It is, uh... confidential.

03:24.504 --> 03:27.139
- He was here last night?
- He was.

03:27.141 --> 03:29.908
- How do you know that?
- The concierge at the hotel

03:30.043 --> 03:32.644
where we are staying recommended
this establishment.

03:32.779 --> 03:34.846
He said it was one of the only
places in Toronto

03:34.982 --> 03:37.715
where someone could go
for a good time. And
if that is the case,

03:37.751 --> 03:40.152
he was definitely here.
- And how are you two connected?

03:40.154 --> 03:42.854
- I am his confidant
and his minder.

03:42.923 --> 03:45.390
I am responsible for his safety.
- Sounds like you're doing

03:45.392 --> 03:48.260
a heck of a job. He's gone and
he didn't tell you where.

03:48.262 --> 03:51.596
- Yes, I failed.
He gave me the slips.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.598
He's often giving
people the slips

03:53.667 --> 03:56.934
when it serves his purpose.
- What exactly is his purpose?

03:56.971 --> 03:59.538
- Whatever it is, he is up
to no good. And there is likely

03:59.673 --> 04:02.274
a woman involved. Indeed, there
is always a woman involved.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.575
- Is that so?
- Yes. Sadly,

04:04.612 --> 04:06.678
Pavel is not a model of decorum.

04:06.714 --> 04:09.681
I must find him before he
further embarrasses his family.

04:09.717 --> 04:11.983
- And before everyone finds out
that you've lost him.

04:11.986 --> 04:14.886
- That, too. No one can find out

04:14.888 --> 04:17.022
he is missing. It would
cause a scandal.

04:17.157 --> 04:19.691
- Well, we could help.
- You?

04:19.826 --> 04:21.226
How?

04:21.295 --> 04:23.562
- We're private detectives.
It's right up our alley.

04:25.832 --> 04:28.100
- Well, the key here

04:28.235 --> 04:31.303
is to be completely discreet.

04:31.305 --> 04:34.272
- Well, you've found
the right ladies: discretion
is our middle name.

04:35.709 --> 04:38.443
- A real prince?
- On a bender in Toronto.

04:38.578 --> 04:41.580
- Ah, we don't know that.
- And this is THE Prince Pavel?

04:41.715 --> 04:43.181
- Yes.
- Of Romania.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.850
- Yes.
- Ah! I have heard

04:45.886 --> 04:48.520
he is quite the scoundrel,
that one.

04:48.589 --> 04:51.523
Did you know he once took over
two entire floors

04:51.525 --> 04:54.459
of the Plaza Hotel in New York
City just to host a party

04:54.461 --> 04:57.462
that lasted a week?
And another time,

04:57.597 --> 04:59.564
I read that
he chartered a yacht,

04:59.633 --> 05:03.335
sailed the Bosporus for a month
with an all-female crew.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.871
- I'm sure they were all
excellent sailors.

05:06.006 --> 05:08.673
- You sure do know
a lot about him.

05:08.676 --> 05:12.277
- Well, no more
than anyone else.
- I'd say you do.

05:12.279 --> 05:14.780
(giggling)
- Well, his life

05:14.782 --> 05:17.082
is very interesting.

05:17.217 --> 05:19.351
The man is next in line
for the throne,

05:19.353 --> 05:22.220
and apparently his father
is not long for this world.

05:22.222 --> 05:24.222
- So you two are already
decided? I could see

05:24.291 --> 05:26.090
why he would want
to avoid the spotlight.

05:26.126 --> 05:29.094
- Says the girl who's going out
with the famous race car driver.

05:29.229 --> 05:32.063
(laughing)
- So you're gonna take the case?

05:32.066 --> 05:35.366
- Of course we are!
It'd be great for business--
if we could find him.

05:35.402 --> 05:37.301
- Even if we can't tell anyone
if we do.

05:37.338 --> 05:39.271
- Well, it's been pleasant.

05:39.406 --> 05:41.373
But back to the bricks.
- You doing okay?

05:41.375 --> 05:42.974
- Let's just say it's a good
thing that a candle

05:42.976 --> 05:46.378
has two ends. But no, I've never
been better. I got exactly

05:46.380 --> 05:48.780
what I wanted: healing
the living during the day,

05:48.816 --> 05:51.583
talking to the dead at night.
It's a full life, ladies.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.657
- Mary, what's this I'm reading
in the<i> Worker's Gazette</i>

05:58.659 --> 06:01.259
about officers from your station
leaning on people?

06:01.328 --> 06:03.661
- Oh, Frankie, don't read that.
It's all lies.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.997
- You sure? Steven Reid
wrote the story.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.799
I mean, he usually
tells the truth.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.401
- Well, the boys at the station
say he's a Red.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.603
- He might be, but doesn't mean
he's not telling the truth.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.772
- Well, he's not! He's wrong.

06:13.841 --> 06:16.207
The men at our station might be
a bit rough around the edges,

06:16.243 --> 06:18.976
but they're not criminals.
- I hope not.

06:19.613 --> 06:21.947
- Have a good day.

06:29.823 --> 06:32.524
- Sure. I talked to the guy
for a few minutes.

06:32.593 --> 06:35.627
He spoke real good English,
you know-- for a foreigner.

06:35.629 --> 06:39.030
A prince of a man, eh?
Pretty good, right?

06:39.099 --> 06:41.032
- Ha, ha.
Real knee slapper.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.767
- So you're saying this guy
was a real prince?

06:42.836 --> 06:44.503
- That's what we hear.
(whistling)

06:44.638 --> 06:46.571
- Don't that beat all?

06:46.640 --> 06:48.707
My mother said I'd never
amount to anything.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.876
- So he was here?
- Oh, he was here.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.244
Large as life.

06:53.313 --> 06:55.247
<i> I mean, this guy?</i>

06:55.382 --> 06:57.649
<i> He really owned the place.</i>

06:57.718 --> 07:00.117
<i> I should have guessed</i>
<i> he was somebody important.</i>

07:06.093 --> 07:08.326
- Where did he go?

07:08.362 --> 07:10.929
- Oh, he said he had to dash.
- Where?

07:10.998 --> 07:14.666
- Mm. It was a joint called,
uh... Barton's.

07:14.668 --> 07:17.702
- The haberdasher?
- The haba-da-what? Huh. No,

07:17.771 --> 07:21.005
wasn't anything like that.
He said it was a place
where they make suits.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.875
- Yes, that's a...
Know what? Never mind.

07:23.911 --> 07:26.711
- He went there last night?
- Hey, if this guy is
who he says he is,

07:26.747 --> 07:28.546
doors are going to be open
day and night.

07:37.557 --> 07:39.691
- He wanted a suit.
Said price was no concern.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.759
Wish I had more
customers like that.

07:41.829 --> 07:44.028
- And he was here alone?
- He was.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.830
Which I thought
was a little strange--

07:45.899 --> 07:48.633
thought a fellow like that would
have an entourage.
- So no one?

07:48.669 --> 07:51.503
- He ordered a suit,
took off in a fancy car.

07:51.505 --> 07:54.973
There might have been a woman
in there, but I didn't
see her up close.

07:55.042 --> 07:58.976
- What kind of car?
- It was a nice,
green Model T Touring.

07:59.012 --> 08:01.780
- Well, if he comes back,
call this number, please.

08:01.782 --> 08:04.849
- Sure! And if you see him
first, let him know his suit
will be ready tomorrow.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.684
- Of course.

08:09.789 --> 08:12.023
- Frankie Drake.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.926
- Alessandro isn't here.
- I was hoping to talk to you.

08:15.061 --> 08:17.195
- About him?
- About the prince.

08:17.264 --> 08:19.997
I hear he's skipped
and you're looking for him.

08:20.033 --> 08:23.468
- So you know who I am now?
- Entertainment and society
people are my beat,

08:23.537 --> 08:26.071
so I asked around
and, apparently,

08:26.073 --> 08:28.940
you are quite something.

08:28.942 --> 08:31.343
- Flattered.
- How'd you hear
about the Prince?

08:31.478 --> 08:33.578
- It's my business
to hear things.

08:33.713 --> 08:36.014
And to know people
who'll tell them to me.

08:36.083 --> 08:39.351
And I'll tell you what I know
for an exclusive.

08:39.486 --> 08:42.119
- What exclusive?
- An interview

08:42.155 --> 08:44.088
with the prince if you find him.

08:44.157 --> 08:46.091
- Well, that depends on
the quality of information.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.626
- Oh, it's quality.

08:48.762 --> 08:52.230
First off, you want to know
why the prince is in town?

08:58.905 --> 09:02.039
- Shaw! Look lively. I need you.
- Me?

09:02.075 --> 09:04.108
- There's a demonstration
needs breaking up.

09:04.144 --> 09:07.045
- Sorry-- and you need me?
- Shaw, stop asking questions

09:07.047 --> 09:10.114
and get to your feet.
There's a bunch of loudmouths
out on Agnes Street.

09:10.150 --> 09:13.251
Some of them are women and we
can't be touching them,
so we need you.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.853
- So for real police work?
- Yeah.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.589
If you want to call it that,
sure. Get moving.

09:20.860 --> 09:22.927
- Are you Shaw?
- Yes.

09:22.963 --> 09:26.264
- I knew your father. Good man.
- Quality man.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.466
- Thank you.
- You stick with us
and you won't get hurt.

09:28.535 --> 09:30.401
- All right. Who are--
who are we going after?

09:30.470 --> 09:33.304
- Nothing but
a bunch of dirty Reds.
- What did they do?

09:33.307 --> 09:36.074
- Well, the usual: trying
to destroy our way of life.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.343
- That sounds serious.
- Nothing we can't handle.

09:38.478 --> 09:40.612
- Especially not
with the daughter of
Detective Shaw on our side.

09:40.614 --> 09:43.148
I'd say those Reds
are done and dusted.

09:49.489 --> 09:52.423
- Should we break in?
- Let's give it a couple
minutes.

09:56.096 --> 09:59.030
Do you want to talk about it?
- About what?

09:59.066 --> 10:01.432
- You and Bill.

10:01.468 --> 10:03.968
Whatever you decide, I want it
to be your decision, okay?

10:03.971 --> 10:06.370
I don't want to factor in on it.

10:06.406 --> 10:10.108
- I don't know what to do.
Bill is a good man!

10:10.177 --> 10:12.911
And I find it hard to believe
I'll find one better.

10:13.046 --> 10:15.913
- There's a "but".
- There's always a "but".

10:15.949 --> 10:18.983
And I can't help but think
that there shouldn't be.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.352
(honking)

10:23.123 --> 10:26.057
Is that her? That's not the car
that the tailor described.

10:27.094 --> 10:29.393
- Haberdasher.
- All right.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.595
Haberdasher.
- Something about the word.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.464
Even though it makes
no apparent sense.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.466
Haberdasher.
(laughing)

10:35.535 --> 10:37.234
Okay. Let's go.

10:55.221 --> 10:56.721
After you.
- Thank you.

10:58.224 --> 11:01.292
- One hard-working citizen after
another tells me the same story.

11:01.361 --> 11:04.562
I listen to them and I believe
them. And you know what I think?

11:04.564 --> 11:07.298
I think it's getting harder
to tell the cops

11:07.300 --> 11:09.233
from the criminals!
(crowd approves)

11:09.269 --> 11:11.569
The police in Toronto
are not acting any better

11:11.605 --> 11:15.039
than the rum runners, the
bootleggers and the Cosa Nostra.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.508
(crowd approves)

11:16.643 --> 11:19.310
- Oh, the Cosa Nostra? That's
hardly a fair comparison.

11:19.312 --> 11:20.912
- And I'm not asking for much!

11:20.981 --> 11:24.315
Just some honesty, yeah?
And accountability.

11:24.317 --> 11:27.151
- The police force is acting
like any other gang

11:27.220 --> 11:29.821
and they must be held
accountable.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.890
(crowd approves)
Don't!

11:31.892 --> 11:33.992
- Oh!

11:36.096 --> 11:38.062
- All right. That's enough.
Break it up.

11:38.098 --> 11:40.865
- All right, everybody,
break it up! Break it up!

11:40.934 --> 11:43.734
- Ladies, let's move along,
please.
- You there.

11:43.770 --> 11:45.870
Put that megaphone down!
- Hey, I have the right
to speak my mind.

11:46.005 --> 11:48.206
- You've said enough!

11:50.444 --> 11:52.943
- Ladies, please,
let's move along.

11:52.979 --> 11:55.146
- Please?
- Yes, please.

11:55.281 --> 11:57.716
I am quite serious. Hey! You!

12:02.355 --> 12:04.222
- Hey!

12:05.826 --> 12:09.661
All right, Red! You just bought
yourself a night in the slammer.

12:09.663 --> 12:11.963
Let's go.
- You all right?
- Mm-hmm.

12:12.032 --> 12:14.432
- Ooh.
- Oh.

12:14.501 --> 12:17.335
- Hell of a job, Shaw.
- Escort Officer Shaw
to the hospital.

12:17.404 --> 12:20.371
- Okay.
- See you back at the station.
Tough cookie.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.512
(mysterious music)

12:34.187 --> 12:36.420
- Who are you?
- We're, uh--

12:36.456 --> 12:39.057
- What are you doing here?
I told everyone I was not
to be disturbed.

12:39.059 --> 12:42.459
- We're looking for Prince
Pavel. We're thinking
you might know where he is.

12:42.496 --> 12:44.528
- I do not.

12:44.564 --> 12:47.465
But I imagine he is hiding
from me if he knows what
is good for him.

12:47.534 --> 12:50.467
- Excuse me?
- If I ever see him again
I will kill him.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.411
- So you have seen him?
- Yes.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.947
- When?
- Not long ago.

13:03.082 --> 13:05.750
We were to elope.
That is why I'm here

13:05.752 --> 13:08.019
in this Godforsaken country.
In secret.

13:08.154 --> 13:10.888
- In secret? You're up on stage.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.692
- I'm an understudy
to a no-talent heifer.

13:14.828 --> 13:16.493
I will not be
appearing on stage.

13:16.530 --> 13:19.631
No one is to know I'm here.
- So where is he now?

13:19.766 --> 13:21.899
- I told you I do not know.

13:22.035 --> 13:23.768
- And why didn't you two elope?

13:25.672 --> 13:28.172
- He said there was
another woman.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.208
- Who?
- I don't care. She's not me,

13:30.210 --> 13:32.042
so he's made the lesser choice.

13:33.613 --> 13:36.114
- We believe that
he might be in danger.
- He betrayed me.

13:36.249 --> 13:39.417
Of course he is in danger.
- From someone else.

13:40.787 --> 13:42.419
- That matters nothing to me.

13:43.456 --> 13:45.289
You may leave now.

13:53.200 --> 13:57.335
- And then he just came running
at me, so I-I-I leapt.

13:57.337 --> 14:00.404
I just leapt out and I tackled
him to the ground.

14:00.440 --> 14:03.741
- You are lucky you didn't break
something. Please stop moving!

14:03.743 --> 14:05.877
- Flo, it was just like being
a real police officer, you know?

14:06.012 --> 14:08.279
Taking down a handsome,
yet dangerous criminal.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.081
- I thought you said
he was a journalist?

14:10.083 --> 14:12.684
- Well, who says a journalist
can't be a criminal?
- And handsome.

14:12.819 --> 14:15.687
- Who said that?
- You did.

14:15.822 --> 14:19.023
- Oh. Well, yes,
I suppose he was.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.758
Oh, Flo.

14:20.894 --> 14:23.360
I think this was one of the most
thrilling days of my life.

14:25.298 --> 14:27.598
- Apparently he was
planning to elope.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.500
- With who?
- Some actress.

14:29.636 --> 14:33.171
- Szofia? She is here?
Then she is behind this.

14:33.306 --> 14:35.740
- I don't think so. She said
that there was another woman.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.409
- Who told her this?
- He did.
- She saw him?

14:38.478 --> 14:41.746
- So she says.
- Where is this other woman?

14:41.815 --> 14:45.416
- She doesn't know.
- Do you have any idea who
this other woman could be?

14:45.551 --> 14:47.184
- No.

14:50.657 --> 14:53.157
What are you doing?
- My job.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.063
Mary?

14:59.132 --> 15:01.933
- Of course. I'll do what I can.
And I'll keep it on the QT.

15:04.804 --> 15:06.804
(applause)
- Hear, hear.

15:06.806 --> 15:09.340
Hear, hear. Hear, hear.

15:09.475 --> 15:11.142
- What is this about?

15:11.277 --> 15:14.145
- Excellent work, Shaw.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

15:14.280 --> 15:17.248
I was just doing my job.
- You took down that Red
singlehandedly.

15:17.250 --> 15:21.218
Some of you boys should be
following Officer Shaw's lead.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.987
- Thank you, sir.

15:26.092 --> 15:29.327
Thank you very much for the kind
words. They weren't necessary.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.562
- Ah, there's no use hiding
your light under a bushel, Shaw.

15:31.631 --> 15:34.432
- What are you up to?
- Oh, just getting out
the old tape measure

15:34.501 --> 15:36.834
and checking some skirts.
- Put that away.

15:36.903 --> 15:39.637
- We got word there's
an abandoned car off Logan.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.439
Thought you might want
to come take a look?

15:41.574 --> 15:44.375
- An abandoned car?
- Mm-hmm.
- That sounds serious.

15:44.444 --> 15:47.512
- Ah, could be nothing,
but thought you might want
to have a walk around,

15:47.514 --> 15:51.015
now that you're a real copper.
- I-- I'd like that.

15:55.689 --> 15:57.622
- Alessandro?
- Bella!

15:57.757 --> 16:00.124
Lunch waits for no one.

16:02.362 --> 16:04.595
You forgot.
- I'm sorry.

16:04.664 --> 16:07.131
Something fell into my lap.
- Something big?

16:07.266 --> 16:10.601
- Royally big. Have you heard
of a man named Prince Pavel?

16:10.603 --> 16:14.472
- I have, indeed. He's a big fan
of mine, or so I've heard.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.340
- You know him?
- Not well.

16:16.343 --> 16:19.610
- Did you know that he's here?
- In Toronto? Why?

16:19.612 --> 16:22.346
- A woman, apparently.
- Ah, that makes sense.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.715
Only one?
- I've counted two, so far.

16:24.784 --> 16:27.584
- Ah, the actress, no?
- Yes. She can't find him.

16:27.620 --> 16:30.221
- That's a surprise.
And the other woman?

16:30.223 --> 16:31.689
- That's the mystery.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.759
- And the reason why
we are not having lunch.

16:34.761 --> 16:37.562
- It's a big deal.
I need to find him.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.296
Rain cheque?

16:40.299 --> 16:42.866
It means a... delay.

16:42.902 --> 16:45.969
Another time.
- Ah!

16:46.006 --> 16:49.173
- Very soon.
(door opening)

16:51.778 --> 16:55.312
- Bill?
- Rain cheque.

16:57.584 --> 16:59.583
<i> Ci vediamo.</i>

17:02.222 --> 17:04.722
- Congratulations
on the engagement.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.824
- Thank you.
- And on the new job.

17:06.860 --> 17:09.660
- I'm looking forward to it.
I think Ottawa is more my speed.

17:09.662 --> 17:11.462
Have you seen Trudy?

17:11.464 --> 17:14.398
- I-- I haven't, but I'll let
her know you came by.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.270
- I...

17:20.306 --> 17:23.874
do love her, Frankie.

17:23.943 --> 17:26.443
- I know you do, Bill.

17:27.447 --> 17:29.280
- How does she feel
about all of this?

17:29.415 --> 17:32.016
- I think you need
to ask her that.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.889
- I'll see ya.
- Bye.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.226
- Oh, nice wheels.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.628
- Doesn't look like
anything's wrong with it.

17:44.697 --> 17:47.899
- Well, so who would leave such
a sweet ride just lying around?

17:47.901 --> 17:51.235
- Well, uh, maybe someone who
did something illegal with it?

17:51.370 --> 17:53.971
Like a hold-up.
- Very good, Shaw.

17:54.107 --> 17:56.240
Too bad there haven't been
any reports of one.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.042
- But I like the way
you're thinking.

17:58.177 --> 18:00.478
- I told you she'd have some
of her old man in her.
- Yeah.

18:00.480 --> 18:03.047
- It's probably some kids
going for a joy ride.

18:03.116 --> 18:05.650
Let's be like the bear
and the mountain.

18:05.652 --> 18:07.518
- Excuse me?

18:07.554 --> 18:09.553
- And see what we can see.

18:24.871 --> 18:26.938
<i> - (Frankie): I'm looking</i>
<i> for a green T Touring.</i>

18:26.940 --> 18:28.705
<i> And no one can know.</i>

18:34.848 --> 18:36.681
- Look at this.
- What?

18:36.683 --> 18:39.550
- Blood.
- Very good.

18:39.586 --> 18:42.553
- Oh! Not really enough
to mean anything.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.688
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Take it from me,

18:44.757 --> 18:46.958
it's nothing.

18:48.427 --> 18:50.027
- Hope no one reports this
missing.

18:50.096 --> 18:52.630
- Why's that?
- Sits here for 30 days,

18:52.632 --> 18:54.031
it goes up for auction.

18:54.167 --> 18:57.768
Wouldn't mind getting my mitts
on a nice touring car.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.903
- I gotta tell you, Shaw,

18:59.939 --> 19:02.907
it's been kind of nice
having you tag along.

19:03.042 --> 19:05.042
- Let's say we think
about making this

19:05.044 --> 19:07.311
some kind of
regular affair?

19:07.313 --> 19:09.180
- Well, I'm not
a real police officer.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.114
- Oh, you're as real
as we say you are.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.452
- It's definitely human blood.

19:15.522 --> 19:18.055
O negative to be exact.

19:18.091 --> 19:20.458
- What's the Prince's
blood type?

19:20.460 --> 19:22.859
- You are asking me?
- You're intending to marry him.

19:22.896 --> 19:24.962
- I did not even know there was
such a thing as blood type

19:25.031 --> 19:27.665
until this very moment. Why
would you ask me such a thing?

19:27.800 --> 19:29.867
- Mary, we're going to need
to get into that car again.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.869
- It's in the impound lot.
- Let's go.

19:32.004 --> 19:35.005
- She can get us in there?
- I certainly can.

19:37.243 --> 19:39.510
- She's a police officer.
- Well, I suppose

19:39.512 --> 19:41.412
that explains
her choice in wardrobe.

19:41.547 --> 19:43.748
- You can see yourself out.

19:50.957 --> 19:52.690
- You there.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.891
- Yes.

19:54.928 --> 19:58.028
- Sorry you got hurt out there.
- That's all right.

19:58.097 --> 20:00.564
But you shouldn't have
tried to run away.

20:00.633 --> 20:03.134
- You going to be okay?
- Oh, I'm tougher than I look.

20:03.269 --> 20:06.137
- You know I don't
deserve to be in here.

20:06.139 --> 20:09.040
- Then you shouldn't
have tried to run away.
- You already said that.

20:09.042 --> 20:12.242
I ran away because your bosses
tried to silence me.

20:12.278 --> 20:14.711
- Excuse me! You were
creating a disturbance.

20:14.747 --> 20:18.115
- I was just spreading the
truth. Sorry you find that
disturbing.

20:18.251 --> 20:20.851
- Just because you say it's
the truth doesn't make it so.

20:20.887 --> 20:23.320
- Then listen.
Let me convince you.

20:26.492 --> 20:28.259
- I... I'm busy.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.861
- Then you're no better
than the men I am after.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.567
- Here it is.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.872
- Bill came by.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.140
- What'd you say?

20:43.142 --> 20:45.276
- Thought I'd leave that
up to you.

20:46.479 --> 20:48.945
- Guess I could be
a detective in Ottawa.

20:48.982 --> 20:50.748
- There's plenty
of politicians to spy on.

20:50.883 --> 20:52.683
I'm sure you could keep busy.

20:52.719 --> 20:54.485
If busy's all you want.

20:54.554 --> 20:57.488
- Uh. Uh, what are we
looking for, anyway?

20:57.490 --> 20:58.756
- I'm not sure, exactly.

20:58.825 --> 21:01.825
But this car is the last place
where the prince was.

21:03.763 --> 21:06.297
Something on your mind?
- No.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.498
- I thought you were the hero
of the police force?

21:08.534 --> 21:10.067
- I am.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.504
- Hello.

21:15.574 --> 21:17.574
Do you know what language
this is?

21:19.078 --> 21:20.578
<i> - (Grigore): Hungarian.</i>

21:20.580 --> 21:23.113
This is good.
- How so?

21:23.149 --> 21:25.850
- Not for Pavel,
but for our country.

21:25.985 --> 21:27.484
- What do you mean?

21:27.520 --> 21:31.922
- It would appear that Roxanna
has found her Prince.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.801
- So who's this Roxanna?

21:43.803 --> 21:46.537
- Ah! She is a real pistol,
as you would say.

21:46.606 --> 21:49.473
Am I using it correctly?
- That's not an expression
I would use.

21:49.608 --> 21:51.208
- Ah!
- What do you mean exactly?

21:51.244 --> 21:54.077
- For a time she was
Pavel's betrothed.

21:54.113 --> 21:55.612
His parents' choice.

21:55.614 --> 21:57.815
- But not his choice.
- No. Oh!

21:57.950 --> 22:00.818
He never wanted to marry her.
- But she didn't feel the same.

22:00.820 --> 22:03.453
- That I do not know.
But according to this,

22:03.489 --> 22:05.956
she followed him here
and demanded a meeting.

22:06.092 --> 22:08.426
- Which, it looks like,
she used to kidnap him.

22:08.561 --> 22:10.761
- Resourceful, no?

22:11.998 --> 22:14.365
- Um...
(grunting)

22:14.434 --> 22:17.768
A man should be able to choose
who he wants to be with.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.703
- Not if that man
is a prince.

22:19.706 --> 22:21.505
And he certainly cannot
choose an actress.

22:21.541 --> 22:25.275
Besides, the marriage
of Pavel Olas and Roxanna

22:25.311 --> 22:28.211
is of crucial importance
to my country.
- Why?

22:28.247 --> 22:31.182
- The creation of the new
country of Romania after the war

22:31.317 --> 22:33.851
included the annexation
of a territory

22:33.853 --> 22:37.254
that was property of Hungary.
They are... unhappy.

22:37.256 --> 22:40.124
Roxanna is a member
of a proud Hungarian family

22:40.193 --> 22:43.059
that is held in high esteem,
so if she is welcomed

22:43.096 --> 22:45.128
into the royal family,

22:45.164 --> 22:47.531
it sends a powerful
signal of unity.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.066
- And what will it do
for the bride and groom?

22:49.135 --> 22:50.734
- That is of secondary
importance.

22:50.770 --> 22:52.670
The fate of our country
matters more.

22:52.805 --> 22:55.505
- Okay. You really are a true
friend and a confidant.

22:55.541 --> 22:58.342
- I am a servant of my country,
first and foremost.

22:59.378 --> 23:00.911
- So, if he and Roxanna
got married,

23:00.980 --> 23:02.679
that would be a great
relief to you.

23:02.749 --> 23:05.015
- Oh! Their marriage would
represent a great load

23:05.017 --> 23:06.817
being removed from my back.

23:06.853 --> 23:09.887
But they should get married
in our homeland.

23:09.889 --> 23:13.089
- But if she kidnapped him,
I doubt that's her intention.

23:13.126 --> 23:15.692
(hubbub)

23:18.731 --> 23:21.432
- Look at the arrest reports
from May 30th,

23:21.567 --> 23:25.101
specifically Detective Lyle.
But I doubt you'll find them.

23:25.138 --> 23:26.904
- Then why would I
look for them?

23:27.039 --> 23:29.440
- Because the fact you won't be
able to find them shows you
I'm right.

23:29.509 --> 23:32.042
Lyle and his partner?
They're no good.

23:32.111 --> 23:35.379
- Well, maybe you're just saying
that because they arrested you.

23:35.514 --> 23:37.915
- Technically, you're the one
who caught me and I bear you
no ill will.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.584
You were doing your job. They
are doing much more than that.

23:40.719 --> 23:43.154
- Hey! Red, get out of here,

23:43.289 --> 23:45.589
or I'll have you
thrown back in the cells.

23:47.393 --> 23:49.727
- And once you discover you
can't find the arrest reports,

23:49.862 --> 23:52.796
might want to check
the hospital records.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.132
- Shaw!
- Yes, sir?

23:56.169 --> 23:57.968
- Was he harassing you?

23:58.004 --> 24:00.804
- No! Nothing
that I can't handle.

24:00.807 --> 24:03.073
- Do you know these broads?

24:06.345 --> 24:08.679
- "Will Frankie find
her prince?"

24:08.814 --> 24:09.947
(laughing)

24:10.016 --> 24:11.816
- I guess the bird
decided to tweet.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.450
- Well, she didn't get
her exclusive.

24:14.654 --> 24:18.155
- It says here the Prime
Minister is very upset.

24:18.224 --> 24:20.624
- Our Prime Minister
is mad at us?

24:20.626 --> 24:23.293
- We finally made it.
- He calls Frankie's decision

24:23.329 --> 24:25.896
to not inform the police about
the Prince's disappearance

24:26.031 --> 24:28.465
"highly irresponsible"

24:28.468 --> 24:31.167
and an "embarrassment
to the Dominion."

24:31.204 --> 24:33.704
(laughing)

24:33.773 --> 24:37.040
- I always wanted to be famous.
You coming?

24:37.076 --> 24:39.376
- I'll stay a while.
- Okay.

24:41.247 --> 24:44.047
- Should I order more coffee?
- Sure.

24:48.387 --> 24:50.053
- Anything you want to share?

24:51.657 --> 24:53.257
(sighing)

24:53.326 --> 24:55.526
- Did you love your husband?

24:56.195 --> 24:58.862
- I did. Completely.

24:58.865 --> 25:01.198
Not that there weren't things
that drove me crazy.

25:02.468 --> 25:05.402
- You didn't have any doubts?
- Little ones.

25:05.404 --> 25:07.671
But not about marrying him.

25:07.673 --> 25:10.474
When does Bill go to Ottawa?

25:10.543 --> 25:12.543
- Soon.

25:14.413 --> 25:17.348
- Well, I imagine you're sitting
here because you want my advice.

25:17.483 --> 25:19.517
- Please.

25:19.652 --> 25:21.819
- Only go with him

25:21.954 --> 25:25.388
if you are looking forward to
waking up beside him every day.

25:36.168 --> 25:38.569
- Looking for something, Shaw?
- Um,

25:38.571 --> 25:40.704
yes. A file I misplaced.

25:40.839 --> 25:43.506
- Oh, yeah? Maybe I can help.
What's it about?

25:43.543 --> 25:46.376
- Ah, a woman named
Michelle Madden.

25:46.412 --> 25:49.513
She's a constant violator
of the hemline bylaw.

25:49.648 --> 25:52.716
- A heinous criminal.
- Well, that is my beat.

25:52.718 --> 25:55.786
- We really have to get you
into a new uniform, Shaw.

25:55.788 --> 25:57.855
You're being wasted
where you are.

26:03.329 --> 26:04.995
<i> - How long have you known</i>
<i> about this, Drake?</i>

26:05.130 --> 26:07.864
- That's confidential.
- I'll "confidential" you
right into the cells

26:07.900 --> 26:10.367
if you don't give me a straight
answer. And I'm not joshing.

26:10.403 --> 26:12.202
- A couple days.
- He's royalty

26:12.238 --> 26:13.871
and he goes missing
in our jurisdiction.

26:14.006 --> 26:15.772
You didn't think to tell us?
- I can handle it.

26:15.808 --> 26:18.409
- If something happens to him,
it's an international incident.

26:18.411 --> 26:21.478
Not that it isn't already.
- I may have misjudged
the severity.

26:21.514 --> 26:23.614
- Oh, you think?
- My client said no police.

26:23.683 --> 26:25.949
- Don't try to push the blame
onto someone else's lap, Drake.

26:26.018 --> 26:27.951
This is your fault.
- I'll find him.

26:28.020 --> 26:29.786
- You better. And if you do,

26:29.855 --> 26:31.589
we'd best be
the first people you inform.

26:31.724 --> 26:33.824
(phones ringing,
typewriters clicking)

26:38.998 --> 26:41.164
(baby crying)

26:42.501 --> 26:44.901
- This is everything
from May 30th.

26:46.305 --> 26:48.505
If you had a dog, I'd say
it just got run over.

26:48.641 --> 26:52.109
- I'm troubled, Flo.
- You don't say.

26:52.178 --> 26:53.843
- I'm finally getting
ahead at work...

26:53.879 --> 26:56.380
- Which should be a source
of happiness. What changed?

26:56.449 --> 26:58.448
- I don't know if I'm getting
ahead with the right people.

26:58.517 --> 27:00.718
- Ooh! Here's a nasty one.

27:00.720 --> 27:04.621
Man, 35 years old, admitted
on the evening of May 30th.

27:04.756 --> 27:08.525
Severe contusions around the
face. Thirty-five stitches.

27:08.594 --> 27:10.927
No broken bones--
well, that's something.

27:10.929 --> 27:13.464
Refused to say where
he got the injuries.

27:13.599 --> 27:16.600
Judging from this report,
I'd say he got beaten up.

27:16.735 --> 27:18.835
- Uh, how long did he stay
in the hospital?

27:20.139 --> 27:22.139
- The attending physician
went to wash his hands,

27:22.208 --> 27:25.309
and when he came back the man
was gone. Injuries like these?

27:25.311 --> 27:27.210
He should have
stayed the night.

27:27.279 --> 27:29.012
- Did he leave an address?

27:29.015 --> 27:32.115
- He did. 900 Wellington Street.

27:34.020 --> 27:35.552
What's up?

27:37.623 --> 27:39.957
- It might be the police that
gave him these stitches.

27:41.260 --> 27:42.559
- No weddings
at city hall today.

27:42.595 --> 27:43.961
- I didn't think so.

27:44.096 --> 27:46.029
Anything else?

27:46.098 --> 27:48.899
- Well, there is an Orthodox
Church where most Romanians
in Toronto go to worship.

27:48.901 --> 27:50.834
- It's as good a place as any.
- Mm-hmm.

27:50.903 --> 27:52.635
- You girls feel like
going to a wedding?

27:52.672 --> 27:54.838
- I'm hardly dressed--
of course!

27:54.874 --> 27:57.574
- Well, here's the address.
- We're not going together?

27:57.576 --> 28:00.076
- I need you to get Szofia.
- Really?

28:00.112 --> 28:02.446
I don't think
she liked me very much.

28:02.448 --> 28:05.716
- Wait, why do we need her?
- If anyone can stop a wedding,
she can.

28:05.718 --> 28:07.384
- Okay.

28:11.157 --> 28:12.856
- Szofia!

28:12.892 --> 28:15.325
Szofia! If you are in there,
please open the door.

28:15.461 --> 28:17.861
Szofia! You are going
to get me killed.

28:17.930 --> 28:20.263
Please, Szofia,
open the door. Szofia.

28:20.299 --> 28:21.464
- Hey!

28:22.468 --> 28:24.200
Excuse me, are you Mr. Grigore?

28:25.337 --> 28:28.105
- Who is asking?
- We work with Frankie Drake.

28:28.240 --> 28:30.474
- Ah.
- What are you doing here?

28:30.609 --> 28:32.342
- I am looking for Szofia.

28:32.411 --> 28:34.478
I believe she knows more
than she has told us.

28:34.547 --> 28:37.313
- So is she not here?
- Apparently not.

28:38.584 --> 28:40.551
Oh, I'm in terrible trouble,
ladies!

28:40.686 --> 28:42.553
The family will have my head.

28:42.555 --> 28:44.154
- Maybe not.

28:44.289 --> 28:46.490
Frankie might know
where Prince Pavel is.

28:46.559 --> 28:47.758
- Where?

28:48.927 --> 28:51.829
Where?
- All right,
you can come with us,

28:51.831 --> 28:53.564
but any trouble
and you answer to me.

28:54.633 --> 28:56.166
- Is that so?

28:56.301 --> 28:58.602
- Just try me.

28:58.737 --> 29:00.104
All right. Let's go!

29:02.174 --> 29:04.241
- You're getting
surprisingly brazen.
- I'm just feeling my power,

29:04.376 --> 29:06.710
Flo. I'm just feeling my power.
There are struggles ahead for me

29:06.712 --> 29:08.912
and I have to be ready.
- I can't go with you.

29:08.981 --> 29:11.314
I have a shift at the hospital.
I can't miss it.

29:11.350 --> 29:13.584
- Of course.
- Will you be all right?

29:13.719 --> 29:15.719
- Will I be
all right?

29:15.788 --> 29:18.989
- Count Grigore of the House of
Dragos would never harm a woman.

29:18.991 --> 29:21.191
- See you.
Let's go.

29:23.095 --> 29:24.761
♪♪

29:42.181 --> 29:45.081
- The prince.
- I'd say.

29:45.151 --> 29:47.784
Only one bad guy. Good odds.

29:50.222 --> 29:52.088
- Szofia!
- Pavel?

29:52.124 --> 29:54.892
Are you all right?
- Apparently it is
my wedding day,

29:54.894 --> 29:58.295
so I could be better.
But this is not my choosing.
You must believe me.

29:58.364 --> 29:59.830
- But you said you'd found
another.

29:59.832 --> 30:02.365
- I only lied to keep you safe.

30:02.401 --> 30:04.635
It appears that didn't work.

30:04.770 --> 30:06.370
- Be quiet, you two.

30:06.372 --> 30:09.639
It's your wedding day.
You shall be overjoyed.

30:09.708 --> 30:11.507
For your bride's sake.

30:11.544 --> 30:13.977
Or you can say goodbye
to this tramp forever.

30:16.215 --> 30:18.081
- I'd say the odds
just changed.

30:23.389 --> 30:26.256
- I wanted to marry you, and
I intended to leave with you,

30:26.292 --> 30:28.958
but then I got kidnapped.

30:28.994 --> 30:30.527
- Then why did you say
otherwise?

30:30.662 --> 30:32.528
- I wanted to keep you safe,
sweetie.

30:33.599 --> 30:35.599
- You did a real dilly of a job
with that.

30:35.601 --> 30:37.533
- I said be quiet,
or I shut you both up.

30:37.570 --> 30:40.203
- Please! This is
the house of the Lord.

30:40.272 --> 30:41.938
Show some respect.

30:42.675 --> 30:44.341
- Sorry.

30:44.410 --> 30:46.342
- At least he respects
something.

30:47.213 --> 30:49.012
- I have a question.
- Yeah?

30:49.048 --> 30:50.980
- Where's the bride?

30:54.253 --> 30:55.985
- Let's go see.

31:05.431 --> 31:07.831
- She's taking this
a bit seriously.

31:07.833 --> 31:10.967
- Well, it is her wedding day.
- She's the one with
the shotgun.

31:12.371 --> 31:13.970
- What are you doing here?

31:14.106 --> 31:16.606
- What do you think?
We're going to a wedding.

31:29.721 --> 31:32.389
- Is this going to take forever?

31:32.458 --> 31:34.257
- You are looking
forward to it now?

31:34.326 --> 31:38.195
- No. I would have thought if
you'd gone to all this trouble,

31:38.330 --> 31:40.597
you would have arranged it
better, but, uh...

31:40.732 --> 31:41.932
Idiots.

31:42.001 --> 31:42.999
- Manners.

31:43.035 --> 31:44.867
- Sorry, Father.

31:49.475 --> 31:50.741
- Look at that veil.

31:50.876 --> 31:53.677
She likely needs it
to hide her hideous face.

31:53.679 --> 31:55.679
- Well, she's actually
an attractive--

31:55.681 --> 31:57.214
Sorry.

31:57.216 --> 31:58.614
- Aren't you a prize?

31:58.651 --> 32:01.284
The only way you could get him
to marry you was to kidnap him.

32:01.287 --> 32:03.519
Pathetic.
- Watch your tongue.

32:03.555 --> 32:05.222
- You let her live if I marry?

32:05.357 --> 32:06.790
- Yes.

32:06.792 --> 32:09.359
- Pavel, you don't
have to do this.

32:09.395 --> 32:11.294
- Roxanna, please.

32:11.297 --> 32:13.296
You're a lovely
young woman--

32:13.365 --> 32:16.500
Well, she is.
But, I don't want to--

32:26.111 --> 32:28.711
- Stop it! This is
a house of God.

32:28.747 --> 32:31.914
(grunting)

32:34.219 --> 32:36.185
- Frankie!

32:39.358 --> 32:41.725
- Sorry, Father.

32:41.727 --> 32:43.527
- I can't believe
you were going to marry her!

32:44.830 --> 32:47.531
- They were going to kill you.
- Whatever.

32:51.303 --> 32:53.936
- Prince Pavel! Oh!

32:55.341 --> 32:57.741
Are you all right?
- Better now.

32:57.743 --> 33:00.543
But weren't you supposed
to protect me, or something?

33:01.747 --> 33:03.346
- I have failed.

33:05.751 --> 33:08.618
- Who are you and why are you
ruining my wedding?

33:08.687 --> 33:10.353
- He will not be marrying you.

33:10.389 --> 33:13.056
- You stay out of this.
He said he would.

33:13.191 --> 33:14.424
- Because you kidnapped me,

33:14.460 --> 33:16.659
threatening Szofia's life.
I will not be marrying you.

33:16.695 --> 33:18.461
- I would not be so sure
about that.
- Ooh!

33:18.530 --> 33:20.430
- Grigore, what are you doing?
Put that gun down, please.

33:20.565 --> 33:23.833
- I am sorry. I'm here to help
you realize your destiny.

33:23.869 --> 33:27.504
Your destiny is to marry Roxanna
and unite your country.

33:27.639 --> 33:29.705
- But I don't want to.

33:29.742 --> 33:33.043
- You are a member of the royal
family. What you want is
of little consequence.

33:33.112 --> 33:35.378
- We can't dishonour
our families, Pavel.

33:35.447 --> 33:38.915
- Like you did when you
kidnapped a man who has no
intention of marrying you?

33:38.984 --> 33:42.586
- She has a point.
- Why don't you sit down
and talk this through?

33:42.588 --> 33:44.588
- The time for talk is over.

33:44.723 --> 33:47.591
Thank you for helping me find
the wayward prince, Miss Drake.

33:47.726 --> 33:49.593
Your job is done.
- I'll decide that.

33:49.595 --> 33:50.994
- Eh!

33:51.129 --> 33:53.330
This is a matter
for our country now.

33:53.465 --> 33:57.133
Pavel, you will marry Roxanna.

33:57.169 --> 34:00.303
Or you will be responsible
for this woman's death.

34:00.305 --> 34:01.838
- No!

34:01.973 --> 34:05.908
(grunting)

34:08.346 --> 34:10.146
Freeze!

34:10.182 --> 34:12.015
Oh!

34:12.150 --> 34:13.916
(laughing)

34:13.952 --> 34:15.685
I could get used to this.

34:17.622 --> 34:18.555
- Yes.

34:18.690 --> 34:21.758
Ach! You cannot just
leave us here like this!

34:21.827 --> 34:24.094
- Once we're safely away,
the Father here

34:24.096 --> 34:26.096
will release you
into police custody.

34:26.098 --> 34:27.964
- What you tell them
is up to you.

34:28.033 --> 34:30.833
- Please, Pavel,
I am pledged to you.

34:30.869 --> 34:32.502
We must marry.

34:32.538 --> 34:34.203
- No. Sorry.

34:34.239 --> 34:36.172
- I will give you a good life.

34:36.208 --> 34:38.308
- I'm sure you would, but...

34:38.377 --> 34:40.243
not the one I want.

34:48.720 --> 34:50.921
- So, what do you do now?

34:51.056 --> 34:52.789
- I don't want to go back.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.658
- Even though your country
needs you?

34:54.660 --> 34:56.259
- No, they don't.

34:56.261 --> 34:59.262
- Marrying Roxanna won't bring
your country together?

34:59.264 --> 35:02.064
- For a few days
everybody would be happy,

35:02.101 --> 35:04.935
but then eventually they will
see me as a traitor
to my people,

35:05.070 --> 35:08.138
as Roxanna will be to hers.
I need my own life.

35:08.273 --> 35:10.006
I need Szofia.

35:11.543 --> 35:13.676
I've changed my life for you.

35:13.712 --> 35:16.546
- People from your country will
always be looking for you.

35:16.582 --> 35:18.682
- I would rather die
than go back.

35:18.684 --> 35:20.216
- Pavel?

35:20.352 --> 35:22.385
- We should start
a new life here.

35:22.454 --> 35:25.555
As... simple people.

35:25.690 --> 35:27.690
- You two are simple people.

35:27.759 --> 35:29.492
Are you happy?

35:29.495 --> 35:31.761
- We get by.

35:31.830 --> 35:34.231
- Yeah. Thanks for asking.

35:34.233 --> 35:37.166
So you'd give up everything
for this woman?

35:37.202 --> 35:40.303
- Of course. I would never
surrender my heart
to compromise.

35:40.339 --> 35:42.505
- Then we should do it.

35:42.541 --> 35:44.240
We should run.

35:44.376 --> 35:47.377
- Others will come for us.
- Not necessarily.

35:48.614 --> 35:51.314
You said that you would
prefer to die.

35:52.985 --> 35:54.918
We can make that happen.

35:55.053 --> 35:56.920
(birds chirping)

35:56.989 --> 35:58.922
- So the police just let you go?

35:58.924 --> 36:00.990
- It is called
diplomatic immunity.

36:01.059 --> 36:04.127
With the prince, I've had to use
it many times. I cannot believe
you let him out of your sight.

36:04.196 --> 36:07.464
- He promised us one week
with Szofia and he'd return
to his country.

36:07.599 --> 36:10.066
- We thought it was a good idea.
We were wrong.

36:11.469 --> 36:13.336
I figured a prince
would know how to swim.

36:13.372 --> 36:14.737
- Good Lord.

36:16.942 --> 36:19.208
- Wanted to camp out in
the Canadian wilderness--

36:19.244 --> 36:21.277
say one last farewell
to each other.

36:21.313 --> 36:24.214
- It seemed like
a romantic idea.
- And you believed him?

36:24.216 --> 36:26.482
- Like I said, we were wrong.

36:26.484 --> 36:29.219
- You there!
What have you found?

36:29.221 --> 36:31.955
- We've dragged
the water for hours.

36:32.090 --> 36:34.890
I'm sorry, there's nothing.

36:34.927 --> 36:37.294
- But you never know. Sometimes
something will pop up.

36:37.296 --> 36:39.729
- Flo.
- But it usually isn't good.

36:39.731 --> 36:40.864
We'll keep looking.

36:47.906 --> 36:51.308
- So they have perished.
- Death by Misadventure.

36:51.443 --> 36:54.578
- The Canadian wilderness
is quite treacherous.

36:56.081 --> 36:58.715
- Well, I suppose I have
no choice but to...

36:58.717 --> 37:01.917
accept your explanation.

37:01.954 --> 37:03.520
- Well, thank you.

37:03.522 --> 37:05.722
- But let me say this,

37:05.791 --> 37:08.591
for all of our sakes...

37:10.195 --> 37:14.096
Those two better remain dead.

37:14.132 --> 37:16.699
- We'll make sure of it.

37:18.337 --> 37:20.070
What do you say, ladies?

37:20.072 --> 37:22.539
Shall we take Grigore
for a farewell drink?

37:24.409 --> 37:27.476
Trudy?
- You go ahead. I got business.

37:27.512 --> 37:29.245
- Guess it's just you and me,
Flo.

37:51.236 --> 37:53.869
- Trudy.
- Hi, Bill.

38:00.111 --> 38:02.846
- So, have you, uh...

38:02.981 --> 38:04.981
decided?

38:06.251 --> 38:08.250
- Bill,

38:08.287 --> 38:11.855
you are a wonderful,
wonderful man...

38:11.990 --> 38:13.456
- You're not coming.

38:15.393 --> 38:16.926
- I can't.

38:16.928 --> 38:19.228
- And you're not
going to marry me.

38:20.999 --> 38:24.534
- Not-- not right now. No.

38:25.737 --> 38:27.536
- Which means likely never.

38:34.212 --> 38:37.013
Why?
- I'm sorry.

38:37.082 --> 38:39.181
- Is your work that
important to you?

38:40.452 --> 38:42.619
- It's just not my work.

38:42.621 --> 38:45.287
It's my family.

38:45.324 --> 38:47.357
My life.

38:48.593 --> 38:50.493
I don't want to leave it.

38:50.628 --> 38:51.894
I don't want to lose myself.

38:51.963 --> 38:53.896
- You'll lose me, Trudy.

38:57.969 --> 39:00.370
- I just think...

39:00.372 --> 39:03.173
this is the way it has to be.

39:18.990 --> 39:20.990
- I'll miss you.

39:20.992 --> 39:23.593
- I'll miss you, too.

39:23.662 --> 39:27.197
(sobbing)

40:01.967 --> 40:04.467
- So you decided to take a look.

40:04.602 --> 40:07.236
- Well, it's clearly
a false address.

40:07.305 --> 40:09.439
- Hm. If you say so.

40:09.574 --> 40:11.240
- And what do you say?

40:11.309 --> 40:14.244
- I say this establishment
used to be the property
of Albert Stewart

40:14.379 --> 40:17.513
until he decided he could no
longer pay protection.

40:17.649 --> 40:19.883
- Then why didn't this
Mr. Stewart press charges?

40:20.018 --> 40:23.419
- If you were able to find this
place, you must have looked
at the hospital report.

40:23.455 --> 40:27.256
If you looked at the hospital
report, you know the answer
to that question.

40:27.292 --> 40:30.993
He reported it to the police.
They did what you saw to him.

40:31.062 --> 40:34.797
- Well, even if what you are
insinuating is true...

40:34.866 --> 40:37.333
I'm sorry-- I don't know
how I can help you.

40:37.369 --> 40:39.202
- Nor do I,

40:39.271 --> 40:41.337
but I know you want to.

40:41.406 --> 40:43.072
- And how do you know that?

40:43.208 --> 40:45.140
- You're here, aren't you?

40:46.745 --> 40:49.345
The<i> Worker's Gazette</i>
is on Simcoe Street.

40:49.381 --> 40:51.413
I'm there 24 hours a day.

40:57.555 --> 41:00.623
- Shaw!
- That Red harassing you?

41:00.758 --> 41:02.625
- No.

41:02.760 --> 41:04.694
- Oh! What then?

41:04.763 --> 41:06.429
- It was just
a chance meeting.

41:06.564 --> 41:08.298
- Oh, I see.

41:08.433 --> 41:09.966
- Funny how that happens.

41:10.101 --> 41:12.368
Meet someone once and,
before you know it,

41:12.370 --> 41:13.970
you're seeing them
everywhere you look.

41:14.039 --> 41:16.039
- That's kind of how you met
your first wife.

41:16.041 --> 41:19.309
- Learned then there was no such
things as chance meetings.

41:19.311 --> 41:21.511
You just end up
putting yourself in places

41:21.580 --> 41:23.045
where you know
the other one will be.

41:23.081 --> 41:26.382
You just don't tell them
and they think it's kismet.

41:26.451 --> 41:28.918
- Kismet?
- Fancy word for fate.

41:28.954 --> 41:31.854
Thing is, there is
no such thing.

41:31.923 --> 41:34.056
Just the fate you make.

41:34.125 --> 41:37.326
You have it in you
to move up the ladder.

41:37.395 --> 41:39.062
- As long as there's someone
steadying it.

41:41.199 --> 41:44.867
- And not pulling it out
from under.

41:44.936 --> 41:46.802
See you tomorrow.

41:46.838 --> 41:49.572
(ominous music)

41:56.347 --> 41:58.414
)

42:03.154 --> 42:05.688
- Oh, looking good.
- Thanks.

42:07.592 --> 42:09.625
You, not so much.

42:09.661 --> 42:13.429
- I just made a decision
that I hope was the right one.

42:13.565 --> 42:15.698
- No decision is forever.

42:15.700 --> 42:18.100
- It is for me.

42:19.170 --> 42:21.103
- Well, then it's the right one.

42:22.807 --> 42:24.773
- I think so.

42:29.180 --> 42:31.781
- You look amazing.

42:31.850 --> 42:35.084
Look, Frankie, what my mechanic
snuck in from Italy.

42:35.219 --> 42:37.320
It's a Barolo so smooth...

42:37.322 --> 42:39.322
Oh, hello.

42:39.324 --> 42:42.391
- You know what?
I--I'm gonna leave.
- No! No, you won't.

42:42.427 --> 42:44.927
Alessandro...?
- Ah.

42:44.996 --> 42:46.796
It's the rain thing again.

42:46.931 --> 42:48.998
- Is that okay?
- Of course.

42:49.067 --> 42:51.868
But you owe me-- big time.

42:51.870 --> 42:54.804
- Well, I look forward
to making payment.

42:59.077 --> 43:00.542
- Enjoy.

43:01.379 --> 43:03.413
- You didn't have to do that.

43:03.548 --> 43:05.748
- Yes, I did. You're my girl.

43:05.883 --> 43:08.517
And I got a free bottle of wine.

43:11.456 --> 43:13.556
You're going to be okay.
