♪♪

00:06.941 --> 00:08.474
Can you hand me the pliers?

00:08.476 --> 00:09.942
Here you go.

00:09.944 --> 00:11.543
Just like scissors,
I'll give them to you

00:11.545 --> 00:12.911
handle-side first.

00:14.615 --> 00:15.647
Hey, you guys.

00:15.649 --> 00:17.316
Oh, no, no.

00:17.318 --> 00:19.618
What are you guys doing
messing around with Dad's grill?

00:19.620 --> 00:22.321
You know he loves
that thing, like,
more than he loves all of us.

00:22.323 --> 00:23.889
Yeah.

00:23.891 --> 00:25.791
Dad doesn't get to grill enough
since he's always away coaching,

00:25.793 --> 00:29.161
so I'm upgrading his barbecue
as a nice surprise.

00:29.163 --> 00:30.229
Wanna help?

00:30.231 --> 00:31.363
Aw.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.399
Wow. Uh, let's see.

00:33.401 --> 00:38.070
Stay here and help you guys
destroy Dad's beloved grill

00:38.072 --> 00:42.141
or go spend time with Diggie
who came back from Australia

00:42.143 --> 00:44.143
just for me?

00:45.479 --> 00:46.612
Bye.

00:49.150 --> 00:50.249
(tightening click)

00:50.251 --> 00:52.051
All right, the grill is a go.

00:52.053 --> 00:53.385
Can you put
the pliers back for me?

00:53.387 --> 00:54.837
Whoa!

00:54.838 --> 00:56.288
You're coming at me
pinchy-side first?!

00:57.525 --> 00:59.591
I thought we were friends.

01:02.196 --> 01:05.397
Pete:
Hey, Parker, I'm home!

01:07.668 --> 01:08.867
You're touching my grill.

01:08.869 --> 01:10.102
Why are you touching my grill?

01:10.104 --> 01:11.870
I love my grill.

01:11.872 --> 01:14.273
Dad, we have
upgraded your barbecue

01:14.275 --> 01:16.341
into a computerized smart grill.

01:16.343 --> 01:19.044
Grill, show him what you got.

01:19.046 --> 01:20.112
(whirring)

01:22.349 --> 01:24.283
<i>Welcome home, Coach.</i>

01:24.285 --> 01:26.351
Whoa!

01:26.353 --> 01:28.620
It speaks!

01:28.622 --> 01:31.390
Yeah! Six different languages!

01:31.392 --> 01:33.892
<i>Danke, Fraulein </i> Evan.

Parker:
It's connected via Wi-Fi
to the kitchen appliances,

01:42.203 --> 01:44.403
so the meat on the grill
and the corn on the stove

01:44.405 --> 01:46.271
are ready at the same time.

Okay, in this scene,

02:56.377 --> 02:59.711
SkyVolt and Garrison realize
than an alien reactor is hidden

02:59.713 --> 03:03.215
in the ice cavern
and it is still operational.

03:03.217 --> 03:04.550
You hear that?

03:04.552 --> 03:07.319
That's fanboys
everywhere gasping.

03:07.321 --> 03:09.188
"(gasps)
What?"

03:10.891 --> 03:12.357
Make them gasp!

03:12.359 --> 03:13.992
(bell rings)

03:13.994 --> 03:15.360
Gemma:
And action!

03:16.530 --> 03:19.198
Garrison, why are
the energy readings

03:19.200 --> 03:21.133
so high in the ice cavern?

03:21.135 --> 03:23.569
(high pitched)
Because there's an alien reactor
somewhere in there.

03:25.539 --> 03:28.207
-Cut!
-(bell rings)

03:28.209 --> 03:30.209
I'm gasping for all
the wrong reasons.

03:32.146 --> 03:35.013
Josh, let me put
this delicately.

03:35.015 --> 03:36.748
Why are you so awful today?

03:37.685 --> 03:38.884
(laughs)

03:38.886 --> 03:41.820
Oh, let me put this
slightly more delicately.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.689
Are you okay?

03:43.691 --> 03:46.225
I'm sorry.
I'm having a little trouble

03:46.227 --> 03:47.326
remembering how
to play Garrison.

03:47.328 --> 03:49.261
Ah. Look at me.

03:49.263 --> 03:50.395
Closer!

03:51.732 --> 03:54.399
Remember how to play Garrison.

03:56.170 --> 03:57.703
-Good talk.
-(bell rings)

03:57.705 --> 03:59.104
And action!

04:00.207 --> 04:02.608
Garrison, why are
the energy readings

04:02.610 --> 04:04.276
so high in the ice cavern?

04:04.278 --> 04:06.812
(deeply)
Because there's an alien reactor
somewhere in there.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.355
I forgot how Garrison walks!

04:17.391 --> 04:18.490
-Cut!
-(bell rings)

04:19.893 --> 04:21.059
Are you okay?

04:21.061 --> 04:23.195
Ever since Maddie
broke up with me

04:23.197 --> 04:25.697
to get back together
with Diggie, I've...

04:25.699 --> 04:27.366
kind of lost my confidence.

04:27.368 --> 04:29.368
Oh.

04:30.471 --> 04:31.970
Yeah, I get that.

04:31.972 --> 04:34.439
Break ups are super hard.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.275
You know, I just went
through one myself.

04:36.277 --> 04:38.377
-Then you know
what I'm talking about.
-Yeah.

04:38.379 --> 04:39.411
Like last night,
I couldn't remember

04:39.413 --> 04:41.246
how to brush my teeth
as a group,

04:41.248 --> 04:44.149
so I did them all
one at a time.

04:46.053 --> 04:48.086
Okay.
(laughs)

04:48.088 --> 04:49.988
I just forgot to condition
my hair twice.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.323
You've got it really bad!

04:51.325 --> 04:53.392
Help me, Liv.

04:53.394 --> 04:54.293
I-- What do I do?

04:54.295 --> 04:56.395
Mm...

04:56.397 --> 04:57.780
Oh!

04:57.781 --> 04:59.164
Well, you know what
helps me kind of refocus

04:59.166 --> 05:02.267
is just a nice, deep,
cleansing breath.

05:02.269 --> 05:03.435
Ready? So...

05:03.437 --> 05:05.304
(both inhale)

05:05.306 --> 05:06.838
(exhales smoothly)

05:06.840 --> 05:08.273
-Doesn't that feel nice?
-Wh--wh--

05:08.275 --> 05:09.508
what do I do
with the air?

05:09.510 --> 05:11.510
-Oh!
-(wheezes)

05:11.512 --> 05:14.146
Oh, Josh.

05:14.148 --> 05:15.914
You forgot how to breathe.

05:22.756 --> 05:23.955
Hey, Mom.

05:23.957 --> 05:25.757
What are you still doing here?

05:25.759 --> 05:28.093
Oh, I volunteered
to be detention monitor.

05:28.095 --> 05:31.196
Oh. I just got out
of Yo-yo Club.

05:31.198 --> 05:32.531
Were you the only one
there again?

05:32.533 --> 05:35.200
Which makes me the president.

05:35.202 --> 05:36.501
(yo-yo whirs)

05:38.172 --> 05:39.271
Oh, Andie?

05:39.273 --> 05:40.972
I'm surprised to see you here.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.741
You're an artist,
not a crumb-bum.

05:44.311 --> 05:46.478
No, I've got
a dark side, Mrs. Rooney.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.414
When people say hi to me,
I don't always say hi back.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.851
Say hi to me.
I dare you.

05:55.389 --> 05:57.222
Checkin' myself in, Mrs. R.

05:57.224 --> 05:59.358
Oh, no. Dump Truck,
you don't have detention.

05:59.360 --> 06:00.826
In fact, it's been...

06:00.827 --> 06:02.293
been months since
you did anything wrong.

06:02.296 --> 06:03.662
Oh.

06:03.664 --> 06:05.230
That's my bad.

06:07.534 --> 06:08.800
(yelps)

06:09.870 --> 06:11.370
Yeah, you're gonna
need a new mop.

06:15.175 --> 06:17.242
And now you have detention.

06:17.244 --> 06:18.143
All right.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.548
I saved you a piece
of filthy hallway
right next to me.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.517
And tomorrow,
I will do the same for you.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.519
-(chuckles)
-Wait a second.

06:27.521 --> 06:30.288
Are you two trying
to get detention?

06:32.226 --> 06:33.925
You got us.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.061
Andie's father forbids us
from seeing each other.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.562
He thinks I'm no good.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.998
Detention is the only way
we can hang out.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.768
By judging me as a crumb-bum,

06:42.770 --> 06:45.270
he has dost condemned me
to be a crumb-bum.

06:45.272 --> 06:46.605
(chuckles)

06:46.607 --> 06:49.408
Well, perhaps I can help.

06:50.711 --> 06:53.011
We are gonna sit down
with Andie's dad.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.246
You know,
I'm a licensed therapist

06:54.248 --> 06:58.049
and I have helped many students
work through their issues.

06:58.051 --> 06:59.618
There's a squirrel
on my bike, guys!

06:59.620 --> 07:01.186
There's a squirrel on my bike!

07:02.689 --> 07:03.855
Mm.

07:05.292 --> 07:06.792
They're not all success stories.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.799
-(beeping)
-Garrison, what's going on?

07:13.801 --> 07:17.135
(deeply) There's a massive
energy footprint coming
from this stalagmite.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.870
(beeping continues)

07:18.872 --> 07:20.138
(device powers down)

07:20.140 --> 07:21.873
Cut.

07:21.875 --> 07:22.941
(bell rings)

07:22.943 --> 07:24.042
Hey, Liv.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.477
I'm here on a field trip

07:25.479 --> 07:26.812
with the Chocolate Milk
Lovers Club.

07:26.814 --> 07:28.814
Oh! Where's...

07:28.816 --> 07:30.282
the rest of the club?

07:30.284 --> 07:32.884
Well, you are looking
at the president...

07:33.954 --> 07:35.353
and only member.

07:37.257 --> 07:39.558
-I love chocolate milk.
Can I join? Oh!
-(gasps)

07:39.560 --> 07:41.493
Ooh...

07:41.495 --> 07:42.928
Can I be vice president?

07:42.930 --> 07:44.996
Ooh. Let's take a vote.

07:44.998 --> 07:46.431
All in favor?

07:46.433 --> 07:47.466
(gasps)

07:47.468 --> 07:48.834
It's unanimous!

07:48.836 --> 07:49.768
(both laugh)

07:49.770 --> 07:53.004
Welcome, Mr. Vice President.

07:55.509 --> 07:56.808
-Ah!
-(chuckles)

07:57.778 --> 08:01.179
(chuckles)
Well, congratulations

08:01.181 --> 08:02.481
on your victory.

08:02.483 --> 08:05.617
Can we do the scene again?

08:05.619 --> 08:06.852
Eh.

08:08.255 --> 08:09.688
This is for you, Joey.

08:09.690 --> 08:10.989
(bell rings)

08:12.926 --> 08:14.292
And action.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.595
-(beeping)
-Garrison, what's going on?

08:16.597 --> 08:20.031
There's a massive
energy footprint coming
from this stalagmite.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.433
(beeping continues)

08:21.435 --> 08:24.336
-The alien reactor must be
buried inside the ice.
-(gasps)

08:24.338 --> 08:25.537
(gasps)

08:25.539 --> 08:26.771
Cut.

08:26.773 --> 08:27.806
(bell rings)

08:27.808 --> 08:30.342
Yes! We finished the scene!

08:30.344 --> 08:32.944
-Josh finished the scene!
-Yeah.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.946
Whoo! I'm back!

08:34.948 --> 08:37.115
Josh is back!

08:37.117 --> 08:38.850
I'm doing a victory lap
around the stage.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.852
Wait for me, buddy!

08:43.657 --> 08:44.956
What just happened?

08:44.958 --> 08:48.193
Joey cheered Josh up
and he was able to act again!

08:48.195 --> 08:52.030
(panting)
He's... he's way too fast.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.500
Joey, something about
having you around

08:55.502 --> 08:57.135
is boosting Josh's confidence!

08:57.137 --> 08:59.371
We need you here all the time.

08:59.373 --> 09:00.972
(gasps)
But Josh will be suspicious

09:00.974 --> 09:02.374
if you're here all the time.

09:02.376 --> 09:03.875
It's hopeless!

09:05.012 --> 09:06.912
Oh, I got it.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.713
Give me a part on <i> Voltage.</i>

09:08.715 --> 09:11.182
Ooh...

09:11.184 --> 09:13.618
that is a really bad idea.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.922
-The worst.
-Yeah.

09:16.924 --> 09:18.924
But if we want
to finish this episode,

09:18.926 --> 09:20.191
I don't think we have a choice.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.826
(scoffs)

09:24.698 --> 09:26.831
Joey, you're on the show.

09:26.833 --> 09:28.900
(sighs)
<i>Voltage </i> needs you.

09:29.736 --> 09:32.804
Would you say that
I'm... your only hope?

09:34.908 --> 09:36.808
Well, I'd really rather not.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.511
You're gonna have to.

09:43.750 --> 09:44.849
Joey...

09:46.553 --> 09:47.886
you are our only hope.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.621
(squeals)

09:53.026 --> 09:55.060
Good morning, <i> Voltage!</i>

09:55.062 --> 09:56.761
I am about to drop

09:56.763 --> 10:00.599
some sizzling hot acting
on this icy cold cavern.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.969
-Joey, you got a part
in the show?
-Oh, yeah.

10:03.971 --> 10:06.071
A very small part. Joey.

10:06.073 --> 10:07.539
-Mm-hmm?
-In this scene,

10:07.541 --> 10:08.807
you're gonna walk in,

10:08.809 --> 10:10.875
you're gonna hand
him the device,

10:10.877 --> 10:13.178
and you're gonna say, "Here."

10:15.082 --> 10:17.082
Yeah...

10:17.084 --> 10:19.818
I'm not sure that's
what my character would say.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.991
But it is what
your character says.

10:25.993 --> 10:28.126
Literally, it is your only line.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.795
Well, actually not anymore.

10:30.797 --> 10:33.198
I Joey'd up the script
a little bit.

10:35.135 --> 10:38.837
And I turned my part
of Scientist #2

10:38.839 --> 10:41.840
into Garrison's new
tech-savvy sidekick:

10:41.842 --> 10:43.975
Jax von Hapsburg!

10:45.912 --> 10:46.845
You're fired.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.413
Oh. Okay.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.248
Well, like any great star,

10:50.250 --> 10:51.916
I burned bright and fast.

10:51.918 --> 10:53.585
Jax out!

10:55.422 --> 10:57.489
(deeply)
Wait, Joey!
Don't go, man.

11:00.460 --> 11:01.926
Kidding!

11:01.928 --> 11:03.495
Kidding.

11:03.497 --> 11:05.697
-No, not fired.
-Oh.

11:05.699 --> 11:06.998
Fired up...

11:08.168 --> 11:11.069
to see this new duo,
Garrison and...

11:12.939 --> 11:14.339
Jax von Hapsburg.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.010
(dramatic music playing)

11:20.347 --> 11:24.115
I won't be able to uncover
this reactor by myself.

11:24.117 --> 11:27.585
To save the world from Zaydock,
I'm gonna need some help.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.827
Help has arrived.

11:35.829 --> 11:39.264
I am Jax von Hapsburg.

11:42.069 --> 11:44.636
Zaydock is about to get...

11:44.638 --> 11:46.237
Jaxed.

11:46.239 --> 11:47.405
Yes!

11:49.710 --> 11:52.043
Cut! Just... just cut.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.678
(bell rings)

11:53.680 --> 11:55.714
Was that too awesome?
I gotcha.

11:55.716 --> 11:59.350
I can give you 20% less awesome.

11:59.352 --> 12:00.418
No, I can't.

12:04.858 --> 12:05.890
(doorbell)

12:09.663 --> 12:11.563
-Oh.
-Hey, Mrs. R.

12:11.565 --> 12:14.532
Dump Truck, our meeting
with Andie's father
isn't until tomorrow.

12:14.534 --> 12:16.101
Yeah, about that. I've...

12:16.103 --> 12:18.603
I've been feeling
some nerviosity

12:18.605 --> 12:21.272
in anticipation of said meeting.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.508
-Mkay, well, come in.
-All right.

12:23.510 --> 12:24.743
-Come in.
-All right.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.077
How can I help?

12:26.079 --> 12:27.846
My first predicament:

12:27.848 --> 12:30.749
should I go with this
leather jacket or this one?

12:30.751 --> 12:32.951
See, I feel like the second one
really lets you know that

12:32.953 --> 12:35.019
I can give you a good pounding
if you step out of line,

12:35.021 --> 12:36.554
-you know what I mean?
-Okay.

12:36.556 --> 12:38.223
So, um, let me
stop you right there.

12:38.225 --> 12:40.425
I don't think that
the look you want

12:40.427 --> 12:43.128
to impress Andie's dad is
aggressive street ruffian.

12:44.598 --> 12:45.697
See?

12:46.633 --> 12:48.233
This is why I came to you.

12:48.235 --> 12:50.502
You are a knower of things.

12:52.906 --> 12:55.206
Also, how do I project
an air of gentlemanliness

12:55.208 --> 12:56.941
without, you know,
looking like a jerk?

12:56.943 --> 12:59.811
Oh, good posture is always nice.

12:59.813 --> 13:02.147
Posture. Mm-hmm...

13:02.149 --> 13:03.848
I see where
you're going with this.

13:03.850 --> 13:07.352
I did not see where
you were going with this.

13:08.722 --> 13:10.121
Walk to me.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.724
If your posture is proper,
the book will not fall
off your head.

13:12.726 --> 13:13.825
All right.

13:15.095 --> 13:16.828
Mm. All right.

13:16.830 --> 13:19.063
-Look at that.
-It's pretty... Ooh!

13:20.233 --> 13:22.667
Stupid book making me look bad!

13:22.669 --> 13:23.902
-(gasps)
-(thud)

13:28.975 --> 13:30.975
Ugh, I am starving.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.977
<i>What are we</i>
<i>barbecuing, gentlemen?</i>

13:32.979 --> 13:34.679
Uh, no barbecue tonight.

13:34.681 --> 13:36.981
It's make-your-own pizza
and salad instead.

13:36.983 --> 13:39.984
<i>You can also make pizza</i>
<i>on the grill.</i>

13:39.986 --> 13:44.656
Nah. Everybody knows
pizza's way better in the oven.

13:44.658 --> 13:46.524
You are one silly grilly.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.929
-(door closes)
-(whoosh)

13:50.931 --> 13:54.732
<i>Enjoy your pizza.</i>

13:55.869 --> 13:58.002
Karen:
Okay, let's make dinner!

13:58.004 --> 13:59.938
-(whooshing)
-Oh. Oh!

13:59.940 --> 14:01.306
Aah!

14:01.308 --> 14:04.609
-Oh, the fridge is as hot
as a blast furnace.
-What?

14:04.611 --> 14:06.978
And all the food is spoiled!

14:06.980 --> 14:09.047
Well, that's weird.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.015
The meat drawer is still cold.

14:13.954 --> 14:16.187
Do you think the grill did this?

14:16.189 --> 14:17.689
No, Evan.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.390
I think the blender did it.

14:19.392 --> 14:20.458
Of course it was the grill!

14:21.995 --> 14:24.796
My mother says sarcasm
is the poor man's wit.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.899
I gave him control
of the appliances

14:27.901 --> 14:29.567
and he super-heated
the refrigerator

14:29.569 --> 14:32.470
and instantly spoiled
everything but the meat!

14:32.472 --> 14:34.072
It's time to shut this down.

14:36.309 --> 14:38.009
(whirring)

14:38.011 --> 14:41.012
<i>How did make-your-own pizza</i>
<i>turn out for you?</i>

14:41.014 --> 14:42.947
<i>Ha. Ha. Ha.</i>

14:44.818 --> 14:47.352
That's it. I'm pulling the plug.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.754
<i>I can't allow you</i>
<i>to do that, boys.</i>

14:51.725 --> 14:52.891
-(whooshing)
-(both scream)

14:57.864 --> 15:00.565
Liv! Thank goodness you're here.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.500
We've been shooting
the same scene all day.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.502
(chuckles)
85 takes.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.704
Oh...

15:06.706 --> 15:09.173
Oh, no. Is it Josh?

15:09.175 --> 15:11.009
No.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.211
It's Jax von Hapsburg.

15:13.213 --> 15:16.214
Who's Jax von...

15:16.216 --> 15:17.415
Joey.

15:19.219 --> 15:21.052
He's run amok.

15:21.054 --> 15:22.587
-Go un-muck him!
-Okay.

15:25.792 --> 15:27.058
Hey, Joey.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.559
-Liv, wait.
-So-- Okay.

15:28.561 --> 15:29.928
I just figured out

15:29.930 --> 15:33.431
Jax von Hapsburg's
signature weapon.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.066
-The atomic yo-yo.
-Okay.

15:35.068 --> 15:38.036
-(whirring)
-"Evil just ran out of time."

15:38.038 --> 15:40.872
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.742
Joey, stop.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.945
You are here to boost
Josh's confidence.

15:46.947 --> 15:48.646
We're not paying you
to act, okay?

15:48.648 --> 15:50.381
We're paying you
to be his friend.

15:50.383 --> 15:51.516
What?

15:53.787 --> 15:55.386
You're paying him
to hang out with me?

15:57.223 --> 15:58.856
Joey, I thought
we were buddies.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.960
And I thought we were friends.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.098
And that was the day...

16:07.100 --> 16:11.836
that Jax von Hapsburg
shed his first tear.

16:18.478 --> 16:21.179
<i>Well, well, look who it is.</i>

16:21.181 --> 16:24.282
If you promise not to bite us,
we have a surprise for you.

16:24.284 --> 16:27.685
We felt bad about yesterday,
so we got you a gift:

16:27.687 --> 16:28.920
all terrain tires.

16:28.922 --> 16:32.323
Once we put them on you,
we can barbecue anywhere.

16:32.325 --> 16:35.159
Tee-hee! We're not really
putting tires on.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.362
-We're being duplicitous.
-Shh!

16:37.364 --> 16:39.497
Don't spoil the surprise!

16:42.936 --> 16:45.837
What do you think of your new
(stifled laugh) tires?

16:47.607 --> 16:50.942
<i>I don't know if I should</i>
<i>barbecue or dance.</i>

16:50.944 --> 16:52.343
You can do both.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.678
Let me give you a countdown.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.613
Three...

16:55.615 --> 16:58.016
two... one.

16:58.018 --> 16:59.017
(beep)

16:59.019 --> 17:00.451
(rattling)

17:00.453 --> 17:01.953
<i>What? No!</i>

17:01.955 --> 17:04.122
<i>You betrayed me!</i>

17:12.732 --> 17:14.699
Is that my grill
heading up to space?

17:18.471 --> 17:20.972
Actually, according
to my calculations,

17:20.974 --> 17:24.208
it should explode
and splash down
in Lake Hacheemachee.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.213
He did it because
the smart grill turned evil.

17:29.215 --> 17:32.483
I feel like there were
less drastic choices,

17:32.485 --> 17:34.085
but it was pretty awesome.

17:37.490 --> 17:38.689
(doorbell)

17:38.691 --> 17:40.058
Oh. Coming!

17:46.099 --> 17:48.499
Come on, Dad!

17:48.501 --> 17:50.435
Fine. I'm here.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.605
But I'm not happy about this.

17:54.607 --> 17:57.275
Well, welcome, Mr. Bustamante.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.510
Thank you for agreeing
to sit down with us.

17:59.512 --> 18:01.746
I know that you'll give
the Andie-Dump Truck issue

18:01.748 --> 18:04.482
the reasonable consideration
that it deserves.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.185
Where is Dump Truck?

18:07.187 --> 18:09.887
Let me guess,
he's not even here yet.

18:09.889 --> 18:11.389
You know why?

18:11.391 --> 18:13.191
Because he's a crumb-bum!

18:13.193 --> 18:15.560
Dad, give him a chance.

18:15.562 --> 18:17.728
I will never give him a chance.

18:17.730 --> 18:18.896
You know why?

18:18.898 --> 18:20.198
Karen and Andie:
Because he's...

18:20.200 --> 18:21.365
All:
A crumb-bum!

18:21.367 --> 18:22.633
Okay.

18:22.635 --> 18:26.637
I assure you, Mr. Bustamante,
Dump Truck is a good guy.

18:29.242 --> 18:31.476
Good evening, honored guests.

18:31.478 --> 18:34.679
Wouldst thou like
some tea and/or crumpets?

18:36.316 --> 18:38.349
I'll have it,
but I won't like it.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.953
What is he doing?

18:41.955 --> 18:44.755
I have turned
your aggressive street ruffian

18:44.757 --> 18:46.924
into a sophisticated
society gent.

18:46.926 --> 18:48.459
You're welcome.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.830
-Nice suit.
-Thank you, sir.

18:52.832 --> 18:55.233
Now that the refreshments
have been served,

18:55.235 --> 18:56.834
let's move on
to the pleasantries.

19:00.006 --> 19:01.706
How 'bout that opera?

19:02.775 --> 19:04.242
That's a whole thing, huh?

19:05.812 --> 19:07.145
As you can see,

19:07.147 --> 19:10.648
Dump Truck is a refined,
well-dressed gentleman.

19:10.650 --> 19:14.685
Truly this tiger has
changed his stripes
and whatnot, you know?

19:15.688 --> 19:17.355
-Exactly. Whatnot.
-Yeah.

19:19.425 --> 19:21.526
And I would love
to have your blessings
to see your daughter.

19:21.528 --> 19:22.760
Hm.

19:22.762 --> 19:25.630
Sorry, not interested.

19:25.632 --> 19:26.731
What?

19:27.667 --> 19:30.001
I-- I made crumpets.

19:30.003 --> 19:33.271
This isn't you.

19:33.273 --> 19:36.607
Where's the guy
who wears an old,
worn out leather jacket?

19:36.609 --> 19:39.710
And says things
like, "Whoa, hey, yo"?

19:39.712 --> 19:41.879
And never pretends
to be something he's not?

19:43.316 --> 19:45.683
That's the Dump Truck I know

19:45.685 --> 19:49.287
and I really, really,
really like him.

19:49.289 --> 19:50.454
Oh.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.790
Three "really"s.

19:54.027 --> 19:55.059
Am I blushing or what?

19:58.531 --> 20:00.231
Look, I'm-- I'm sorry.

20:01.568 --> 20:03.801
I did all this stuff
so that I could, you know,

20:03.803 --> 20:05.970
impress your father,
and the only person

20:05.972 --> 20:07.705
I wanted to impress is you.

20:09.242 --> 20:10.374
Wow.

20:12.845 --> 20:15.646
What you just said could only be
said by a real gentleman.

20:16.816 --> 20:19.483
I think that I was
wrong about you.

20:20.587 --> 20:23.421
So, do we have your blessing?
Can I go out with him?

20:23.423 --> 20:25.289
Absolutely not!

20:26.492 --> 20:29.727
I can't have my daughter dating
a guy named Dump Truck.

20:29.729 --> 20:30.861
Fine.

20:30.863 --> 20:32.597
Look, if it allows me
to date Andie,

20:32.599 --> 20:35.600
I will from this point forward
go by my given name...

20:37.670 --> 20:39.003
Marion Truckberg.

20:41.941 --> 20:43.507
Oof.

20:43.509 --> 20:44.842
Stick to Dump Truck.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.611
-Yeah?
-All right, I will.

20:52.018 --> 20:53.217
Hey, Josh.

20:53.219 --> 20:55.119
Hey, buddy. How you doin'?

20:55.121 --> 20:56.687
That depends.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.489
How much did Liv pay you
to ask that?

21:00.226 --> 21:02.693
Josh, we really never meant
to hurt your feelings.

21:02.695 --> 21:04.629
We were just trying
to rebuild your confidence.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.764
Well, paying Joey
to be my friend

21:06.766 --> 21:08.799
wasn't the best way
to rebuild my confidence.

21:08.801 --> 21:12.069
Dude, I wasn't faking
the friendship.

21:12.071 --> 21:14.438
I'd hang out with you for free.

21:15.808 --> 21:18.276
-Seriously?
-Yeah. Absolutely, man.

21:18.278 --> 21:22.546
I just got a taste
of fame and mm, mm, mm,

21:22.548 --> 21:24.715
she tastes so good.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.286
I'm sorry.

21:28.288 --> 21:31.589
Hey, don't you apologize
for Jax von Hapsburg.

21:31.591 --> 21:34.091
He was the one good thing
to come out of this.

21:34.093 --> 21:35.993
Both:
For real?

21:35.995 --> 21:37.228
Yeah.

21:37.230 --> 21:39.397
I mean, would I lie
to my tech-savvy sidekick?

21:39.399 --> 21:40.731
You would not.

21:40.733 --> 21:41.799
Bro hug?

21:44.837 --> 21:45.903
Ah.

21:48.574 --> 21:50.341
Um...

21:50.343 --> 21:52.009
that was super weird...

21:53.413 --> 21:56.314
but I-- I feel awful.

21:57.350 --> 21:59.917
I never should have gone
behind your back. I'm sorry.

22:00.853 --> 22:03.421
-Yeah, that wasn't cool.
-Mm-mm.

22:03.423 --> 22:06.424
But I do appreciate you
trying to help.

22:06.426 --> 22:07.525
(chuckles)

22:07.527 --> 22:08.759
I was a hot mess, wasn't I?

22:08.761 --> 22:10.795
Yeah, you were.

22:10.797 --> 22:12.430
You forgot how to breathe.

22:12.432 --> 22:13.664
(both laugh)

22:15.335 --> 22:16.534
Do you forgive me?

22:17.704 --> 22:19.403
I will after a bro hug.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.640
I'd really rather not.

22:22.642 --> 22:23.908
You're gonna have to.

22:26.479 --> 22:28.546
Ugh, all right.

22:29.515 --> 22:31.015
Let's bro hug it out.

22:35.054 --> 22:36.253
(laughs)

22:39.192 --> 22:42.727
Hey, now that we're free
to socialize publicly,

22:42.729 --> 22:45.396
care to join me
for a celebratory frozen yogurt?

22:45.398 --> 22:47.331
I'd love that...

22:47.333 --> 22:48.566
Marion.

22:48.568 --> 22:49.633
All right, come on.

22:50.870 --> 22:54.705
Somebody karate kicked
the door to my car.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.707
I know it was you, Dump Truck.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.642
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait,
it wasn't me, I swear.

22:58.644 --> 22:59.877
It must have been, uh...

22:59.879 --> 23:01.045
(action music plays)

23:02.515 --> 23:05.583
Jax von Hapsburg!

23:12.225 --> 23:14.658
I'm comin' for you, Jax!

23:18.197 --> 23:19.497
No, no, no, no, no!

23:24.337 --> 23:26.737
Dump Truck, I was
wrong about you.

23:28.174 --> 23:29.507
You're all right!

23:31.511 --> 23:32.676
Mr. Bustamante:
He's a crumb-bum!
