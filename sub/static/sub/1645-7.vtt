two of the tower guards.

17:11.378 --> 17:13.249
We've got to go.
They can't find us here.

17:13.293 --> 17:14.381
Gringos!
But what about this?

17:14.424 --> 17:15.382
Stash it!

17:15.425 --> 17:16.513
Come on!

17:19.386 --> 17:19.995
Come on!

17:22.954 --> 17:23.694
Go. Go.

17:24.652 --> 17:27.785
Where are you
off to, Backra?

17:29.439 --> 17:31.224
[panting]

17:59.991 --> 18:02.298
Where you boys been?

18:02.342 --> 18:03.256
In the bathroom?

18:05.475 --> 18:06.476
This has all been

18:06.520 --> 18:08.217
a terrible mistake.

18:08.261 --> 18:09.305
Has it been?

18:09.349 --> 18:10.872
We've, uh, we've
worked it out.

18:10.915 --> 18:14.702
There's no need
to take this any further.

18:18.662 --> 18:20.838
I can't have your foolishness
spread in this place.

18:20.882 --> 18:23.319
I gave you every
chance to pull out.

18:23.363 --> 18:26.366
Please.

18:26.409 --> 18:29.151
We know the rules!

18:29.195 --> 18:30.326
Two men go in,

18:30.370 --> 18:31.414
one man comes out!

18:31.458 --> 18:33.764
[shouting]

18:36.419 --> 18:38.160
LECHERO:
Now,

18:38.204 --> 18:39.901
this quarrel must be settled.

18:40.423 --> 18:42.904
Let's go.

19:07.102 --> 19:10.236
MEN [chanting]:
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

19:11.541 --> 19:14.675
[men shouting]

19:19.419 --> 19:22.117
[indistinct shouts]

19:29.124 --> 19:31.344
What are you gentlemen
waiting for?

19:36.436 --> 19:39.178
You two don't make this
more interesting, I will.

19:39.221 --> 19:42.268
[indistinct shouts continue]

19:43.878 --> 19:45.227
[cheering]

19:45.271 --> 19:47.925
Sorry, mate-- if only one
of us is getting out...

19:49.579 --> 19:51.799
[cheering]

19:57.457 --> 19:59.241
[phone ringing]

20:04.290 --> 20:05.639
How's it look?

20:05.682 --> 20:06.988
They got LJ
in the back of the van.

20:07.031 --> 20:09.730
He seem all right to you?Yeah, I think so.

20:09.773 --> 20:11.819
All right,
how many people they got?

20:11.862 --> 20:14.125
She's got a driver
and a bodyguard-- that's it.

20:14.169 --> 20:15.431
All right.

20:15.475 --> 20:16.606
You know I appreciate
you hanging around, man.

20:16.650 --> 20:19.479
Hey, we started this
together, bro.

20:19.522 --> 20:21.307
Let's finish it that way.

20:22.482 --> 20:24.266
Come on, Michael.

20:24.310 --> 20:26.312
Where are you?

20:42.371 --> 20:45.592
[men shouting]

20:45.635 --> 20:47.246
[blow lands, grunts]

21:12.183 --> 21:13.315
[grunts]

21:17.319 --> 21:19.887
[blows landing]

21:27.198 --> 21:28.852
What you doing here?

21:28.896 --> 21:30.245
You're supposed
to be keeping watch.

21:30.289 --> 21:33.074
Just checking, making sure
everything is all right.

21:33.117 --> 21:36.338
They're running a bit late,
that's all.

21:36.382 --> 21:38.384
So, what's the plan?

21:38.427 --> 21:42.953
You gonna swim out, wait for
the police to pass, and...

21:42.997 --> 21:45.521
meet with a boat somewhere?

21:45.565 --> 21:47.436
Something like that.

21:49.438 --> 21:50.483
And then what?

21:50.526 --> 21:51.832
You know what,
you need to get back

21:51.875 --> 21:53.399
to the car...
Don't move.

21:56.532 --> 21:58.621
Wow.

21:58.665 --> 22:00.144
I'm impressed.

22:00.188 --> 22:01.755
You've actually got the guts
to look me in the eye

22:01.798 --> 22:02.886
as you stab me
in the back.

22:02.930 --> 22:04.671
What are you going to do,
shoot me?

22:04.714 --> 22:06.760
Don't.
I can't let you hand over

22:06.803 --> 22:07.978
James to
those people.

22:08.022 --> 22:09.240
You need to think
about what you're doing.

22:09.284 --> 22:10.546
I have!

22:10.590 --> 22:12.374
Every since you told me
what they did to Sara.

22:12.418 --> 22:15.682
When they get here,
James and I, we're leaving.

22:15.725 --> 22:17.423
Where to?

22:17.466 --> 22:20.208
I don't know.
Somewhere they won't find us.

22:20.251 --> 22:22.863
So, this whole time,
you played me.

22:22.906 --> 22:24.255
Like you've been playing me.

22:24.299 --> 22:26.345
Bringing me here
to be your lookout?

22:27.433 --> 22:28.956
But it's okay.

22:28.999 --> 22:31.262
We were both here
doing what we had to

22:31.306 --> 22:32.960
for the people we love.

22:34.788 --> 22:38.400
You do this, you may as well
be shooting my son yourself.

22:44.450 --> 22:46.365
I'm sorry.

22:57.593 --> 22:59.378
[phone ringing]

22:59.421 --> 23:00.901
Yeah.

23:00.944 --> 23:03.469
They should be out by now.
Any sign?

23:03.512 --> 23:04.687
All quiet.

23:04.731 --> 23:06.385
How much longer
do you want to give them?

23:09.692 --> 23:10.998
I know you
wanted to live

23:11.041 --> 23:12.434
by an ocean your whole life.

23:12.478 --> 23:13.827
Sad to think

23:13.870 --> 23:15.089
the closest you'll get
is being buried under one.

23:15.132 --> 23:16.438
You're not
gonna kill me.

23:16.482 --> 23:17.918
Oh?
You need me.

23:17.961 --> 23:19.006
You already killed Sara.

23:19.049 --> 23:20.137
Anything happens to me,

23:20.181 --> 23:22.444
you're out of bargaining chips.

23:22.488 --> 23:25.055
If Michael doesn't
get Whistler out today,

23:25.099 --> 23:26.666
I don't need to bargain anymore.

23:26.709 --> 23:28.363
You'll all be dead.

24:15.845 --> 24:20.067
[men yelling]

24:23.200 --> 24:25.681
Kick him in the junk, Scofield!

24:25.725 --> 24:28.989
[men yelling]

24:33.297 --> 24:36.039
What are you looking for, boy!
There are no draws here!

24:36.083 --> 24:38.259
If this isn't finished
by one of you,

24:38.302 --> 24:42.306
I'm coming down
to finish both of you.

24:45.962 --> 24:48.617

25:05.939 --> 25:10.639

[men yelling]

25:17.907 --> 25:20.519
[men yelling]

25:26.568 --> 25:27.482
End it.

25:27.526 --> 25:32.313
[men yelling]

25:33.009 --> 25:35.403
God... God forgive me.

25:42.323 --> 25:46.849

[alarm blaring]

26:02.952 --> 26:06.303
[alarm blaring]

26:06.347 --> 26:08.218
They should have
been here by now.

26:08.262 --> 26:10.046
Maybe they get out.
They should be on their way.

26:10.090 --> 26:12.919
They didn't make it.So what do we do now?

26:12.962 --> 26:14.007
I don't care what you do,

26:14.050 --> 26:15.399
but I'm taking the car.

26:15.443 --> 26:16.662

26:22.015 --> 26:25.409
[alarm blaring]

26:28.021 --> 26:31.024
[alarm blaring]

27:10.890 --> 27:13.980

27:14.023 --> 27:15.111
What the hell's going on?

27:15.155 --> 27:18.375
[speaking Spanish]

27:18.419 --> 27:20.813
Put your hands up on your head!

27:29.169 --> 27:32.085
You come down here.

27:32.128 --> 27:34.217
Now!

27:34.261 --> 27:37.612
We are going to find out
who is behind this.

27:40.963 --> 27:43.183
[phone ringing]

27:45.054 --> 27:46.577
What?

27:46.621 --> 27:49.015
Were you going to let me know
what the hell's going on?

27:49.058 --> 27:50.973
Lincoln?

27:51.017 --> 27:52.758
I'm here.

27:52.801 --> 27:54.281
Good. Where are they?

27:57.153 --> 27:58.154
They're in the car with me.

27:58.198 --> 27:59.765
I heard the alarm.

27:59.808 --> 28:01.680
They were long gone
before that thing went off.

28:01.723 --> 28:03.029
Well, if they got
such a head start,

28:03.072 --> 28:04.508
why are you so far behind?

28:04.552 --> 28:06.641
Listen, do you want me
to talk to you or drive?

28:06.685 --> 28:09.513
I want you to put Whistler
on the phone.

28:09.557 --> 28:10.601
What?

28:10.645 --> 28:11.690
Put him on.

28:13.996 --> 28:15.128
He's in the trunk.

28:15.171 --> 28:16.695
But, if you feel
that strongly about it,

28:16.738 --> 28:18.827
I can pull over and you two
can have a nice little talk.

28:18.871 --> 28:21.003
If we're real lucky, maybe
some cops will swing by.

28:21.047 --> 28:22.091
I'm sure they'd
like a word, too.

28:22.135 --> 28:25.791
You know what?
Just get LJ ready.

28:29.229 --> 28:35.322
Whoever tried to escape
assaulted one of my men.

28:35.365 --> 28:39.021
And, as you know,
any attempt on the life

28:39.065 --> 28:40.327
of a Panamanian soldier

28:40.370 --> 28:44.113
warrants the death penalty.

28:44.157 --> 28:46.202
This attempt was made
from cell #212.

28:46.246 --> 28:49.162
And if memory serves,

28:49.205 --> 28:53.383
that cell belongs to members
of your crew, no?

29:07.963 --> 29:09.399
You.

29:14.100 --> 29:15.623
You are one
of the Milkman's boys.

29:17.016 --> 29:18.495
Is it your cell?

29:29.855 --> 29:31.944
[gunshot]

29:38.298 --> 29:41.910
I'm going to take
that as a yes.

29:45.261 --> 29:48.351
I thought we were compadres,
you and I.

29:48.395 --> 29:50.963
I let you run your business,
have your whores.

29:51.006 --> 29:53.574
When you asked me for your
own personal supply of water

29:53.617 --> 29:56.272
when the plumbing went down,
did I not provide it?

29:56.316 --> 29:57.447
When you asked me
to get rid

29:57.491 --> 29:59.232
of the phones,
make them contraband,

29:59.275 --> 30:03.105
so you could control
the trade in here,

30:03.149 --> 30:05.064
did I not comply?

30:05.107 --> 30:06.674
I do all of this for you.

30:06.717 --> 30:10.025
And in exchange,
you were to do one thing

30:10.069 --> 30:13.202
for me.

30:13.246 --> 30:14.638
Keep these men in line!

30:23.256 --> 30:26.999
Maybe we just
backed the wrong horse, hmm?

30:27.042 --> 30:32.918
Perhaps there is another in here
better suited for the job.

30:41.927 --> 30:45.017
Good luck, Bredda.

30:47.236 --> 30:49.456
[whistles]

30:52.154 --> 30:54.678
[yelling in Spanish]

31:07.343 --> 31:08.301
You know none
of us tried

31:08.344 --> 31:10.303
to break out of that cell.

31:10.346 --> 31:11.608
I do.

31:11.652 --> 31:14.133
Then you must know there's
only one guy here

31:14.176 --> 31:15.612
foolish enough to try.

31:24.143 --> 31:26.623
[knocking on door]

31:26.667 --> 31:29.235
Hey.

31:29.278 --> 31:31.106
Nice to see you
back in form.

31:31.150 --> 31:33.065
Thanks.

31:33.108 --> 31:35.197
Any news from Sullins?

31:35.241 --> 31:37.852
He's working on it.

31:40.246 --> 31:43.118
It doesn't matter
what people say.

31:43.162 --> 31:46.295
What do they say?

31:46.339 --> 31:49.168
You know people,
how they talk.
About?

31:49.211 --> 31:53.259
The men, the ones
they say you killed.

31:53.302 --> 31:55.609
Is it true?

31:55.652 --> 31:58.873
Because, if it is, you can
talk to me about it.

32:10.189 --> 32:11.364
Is that a fact?

32:11.407 --> 32:13.932
Yes. You can trust me.

32:13.975 --> 32:15.368
So let me get this straight.

32:15.411 --> 32:17.196
Sullins sends you
to be good cop?

32:17.239 --> 32:18.327
That's not what this is.

32:18.371 --> 32:20.373
There never was a deal,
was there?

32:20.416 --> 32:21.983
Sullins just wants me
to confess,

32:22.027 --> 32:24.203
so he can bring me up on more
charges back in the States.

32:24.246 --> 32:25.204
The deal is legit.

32:25.247 --> 32:26.335
The hearing was supposed to be

32:26.379 --> 32:28.381
an hour
after we left the prison,

32:28.424 --> 32:29.773
and I'm still waiting.

32:29.817 --> 32:31.471
So why don't you just
come clean, Felicia, huh?

32:31.514 --> 32:35.736
For old times' sake?
How about it?

32:35.779 --> 32:39.174
How about you do me
the same courtesy, Alex?

32:39.218 --> 32:40.828
I'm not blind.
My brother was a user.

32:40.871 --> 32:42.656
I can smell the stuff
a mile away.

32:42.699 --> 32:44.963
Don't you accuse me of being
the one who's hiding something.

32:49.489 --> 32:53.014
[woman speaking Spanish

33:00.195 --> 33:02.023
Hey, I just got confirmation
from the radio.

33:02.067 --> 33:04.547
The guards took a head count
and they secured the perimeter.

No one made it out
of there today.

33:10.466 --> 33:11.424

33:11.467 --> 33:12.991
Looks like
they're packing up.

33:13.034 --> 33:14.035
Whatever you do

don't let them take LJ,
all right?

You sure you want to
make promises to your
son you can't keep?

35:08.541 --> 35:09.585
Watch your mouth.

35:09.629 --> 35:11.239
I'll let you in
on a little secret.

35:11.283 --> 35:12.806
When you choose

35:12.849 --> 35:15.330
this line of work, you know
it's all going to come down

35:15.374 --> 35:17.419
to a moment like this.

35:17.463 --> 35:19.160
So kill me.

35:22.555 --> 35:24.209
Let him go.

35:25.732 --> 35:27.603
Let him go!Kill him, kill him.

35:27.647 --> 35:28.648
Dad!

35:28.691 --> 35:29.997
Dad!

35:30.040 --> 35:32.260
It doesn't matter
what you do to me.

35:32.304 --> 35:34.784
The operation failed.

35:34.828 --> 35:36.743
So put your gun
down, Linc.

35:39.572 --> 35:40.442
Kill him.[gun cocking]

35:40.486 --> 35:41.574
Dad!

35:43.402 --> 35:44.968
[yelling]

35:46.405 --> 35:48.885
No!

35:52.454 --> 35:53.325
Give me one more shot.

35:53.368 --> 35:54.456
To do what?

35:54.500 --> 35:56.415
Let me find out
what happened in Sona.

35:56.458 --> 35:57.416
Let me talk to Michael.

35:57.459 --> 35:59.374
We can still get Whistler.

35:59.418 --> 36:00.375
We can make this happen.

36:00.419 --> 36:02.986
We can make this happen. We...

36:08.427 --> 36:10.211
We can do this.

36:10.255 --> 36:11.908
Put him in the van.

36:23.355 --> 36:24.356
[engine starting]

36:35.671 --> 36:37.238
Sucre!

36:38.544 --> 36:39.501
You all right?

36:39.545 --> 36:41.808
What happened?

36:44.332 --> 36:46.291
Body bags.

37:00.740 --> 37:01.828
Look, what happened out there...

37:01.871 --> 37:04.396
Happened out there.
It's over.

37:04.439 --> 37:06.093
All right then.

37:09.183 --> 37:11.098
Right, just so you know,

37:11.141 --> 37:12.404
I wouldn't have
gone through with it.

37:12.447 --> 37:15.015
Lucky for us, we'll never
have to find out.

37:16.495 --> 37:19.498
So what do
we do now?

37:19.541 --> 37:20.499
[door opening]

37:20.542 --> 37:22.762
You know why we're here, boy.

37:22.805 --> 37:25.068
Well, I'm no doctor,
but I'm just guessing

37:25.112 --> 37:27.375
your mother had a little bit
too much to drink one night

37:27.419 --> 37:28.420
and, um...

37:28.463 --> 37:29.508
Keep talking

37:29.551 --> 37:30.770
and you're going to be next.

37:41.607 --> 37:43.304
[groans]

37:48.570 --> 37:50.442
How you want it, brother?

37:50.485 --> 37:52.052
Fast or slow?

37:53.009 --> 37:56.274
Think I'd like to handle
this one myself.

38:08.111 --> 38:11.332
Do you have children,
Mr. Scofield?

38:11.376 --> 38:14.204
Maybe someday.

38:14.248 --> 38:17.164
That's very optimistic
for a man in your position.

38:17.207 --> 38:18.731
Myself, I have five.

38:18.774 --> 38:20.820
Three boys,
two girls.

38:20.863 --> 38:22.909
Now I used to tell
them a story--

38:22.952 --> 38:24.606
I believe in your country

38:24.650 --> 38:26.695
they call it,
"The Boy Who Cried Wolf."

38:26.739 --> 38:28.218
You know it?

38:28.262 --> 38:30.656
Well, then you know
the moral of that story

38:30.699 --> 38:32.005
is even when liars
tell the truth,

38:32.048 --> 38:33.528
they can never be believed.

38:33.572 --> 38:36.270
But your life's
on the line, boy.

38:36.314 --> 38:40.796
Are you trying to break out
of this prison, Mr. Scofield?

38:43.190 --> 38:44.800
No.

38:47.934 --> 38:50.066
Are you trying to break out
of this prison?

38:50.110 --> 38:51.241
We both know
that's not possible.

38:51.285 --> 38:52.634
Answer me!What do you want me to say?

38:52.678 --> 38:54.680
I want you to tell
me the truth. I want to hear it.

38:54.723 --> 38:57.073
You want a reason
to kill me.No, boy...

38:57.117 --> 38:59.249
I have good reason to kill you.

38:59.293 --> 39:00.773
Because of you,
it's no longer possible

39:00.816 --> 39:02.383
for me to effectively
govern this prison.

39:02.427 --> 39:03.515
Justified or not,

39:03.558 --> 39:05.125
the men no longer
have faith in me.

39:05.168 --> 39:07.301
That leaves only one thing
for me to do

39:07.345 --> 39:08.302
to guarantee my survival.

39:21.446 --> 39:26.059
You are breaking out
of this prison, Mr. Scofield.

39:26.102 --> 39:28.453
And you're taking me with you.

39:53.826 --> 39:54.914
Well, I've got some good news

39:54.957 --> 39:58.091
and I've got some better news.

39:58.134 --> 39:59.092
Let's start
with the good.

39:59.135 --> 40:03.575
Panamanians
are back on board.

40:03.618 --> 40:04.706
And the better news?

40:04.750 --> 40:06.969
You're going to get to have

40:07.013 --> 40:08.623
a really nice sleep
on that bed.

40:08.667 --> 40:10.669
I thought that I...

40:10.712 --> 40:13.715
After the hearing I was going to
be on a plane back to the U.S.

40:13.759 --> 40:14.934
You said...

40:14.977 --> 40:16.239
I did, and you will be,

40:16.283 --> 40:18.198
but it's just too late
to do the hearing now.

40:18.241 --> 40:20.156
We'll get to it
first thing tomorrow.

40:20.200 --> 40:22.376
Tomorrow morning?Sounds about right.

40:25.510 --> 40:28.208
Please... is there something,
is there anything

40:28.251 --> 40:30.863
that we can do to help
speed things up?

40:30.906 --> 40:32.168
When a genie grants
you a wish,

40:32.212 --> 40:34.127
you don't really tell him
to make it snappy.

40:34.170 --> 40:35.607
This hearing

40:35.650 --> 40:38.044
needs to happen today.

40:38.087 --> 40:41.439
The hearing needs...
needs to happen right now!

40:41.482 --> 40:42.352
Listen to you.

40:42.396 --> 40:43.789
You know, you are unbelievable.

40:43.832 --> 40:45.791
I have dropped everything

40:45.834 --> 40:46.835
to come down here

40:46.879 --> 40:48.184
and drag your sorry ass

40:48.228 --> 40:49.490
out of that hellhole...You don't understand.

40:49.534 --> 40:53.102
I've made you a deal.I can't... I can't wait.

40:54.452 --> 40:55.801
I can't wait.

40:55.844 --> 40:57.106
You know, I am so glad

40:57.150 --> 40:58.847
I have made
this trip

40:58.891 --> 41:01.850
to help your esteemed colleague.

41:01.894 --> 41:03.330
I am just tickled.

41:03.373 --> 41:04.853
Cuff him.

41:04.897 --> 41:06.725
Is that necessary?

41:06.768 --> 41:08.291
Cuff him.

41:15.821 --> 41:18.214
I'm sorry.

41:18.258 --> 41:19.999
I can't wait.

41:28.268 --> 41:31.401
Hey, have you
seen Whistler?

41:31.445 --> 41:32.402
No.

41:33.229 --> 41:34.796
You know, I spent
my whole career

41:34.840 --> 41:37.495
trying to keep bad
people behind bars.

41:37.538 --> 41:39.148
Like somehow by doing my job

41:39.192 --> 41:41.629
I was making the world
a better place.

41:41.673 --> 41:43.892
And then...

41:43.936 --> 41:46.591
then you hear about
what happened to
someone like Sara.

41:48.201 --> 41:50.464
Damn if it doesn't seem
like there's more bad people

41:50.508 --> 41:53.032
out there than in here.

41:58.341 --> 42:01.170
I warned the brothers what would
happen if they failed.

42:01.214 --> 42:04.130
If I give them more time now,
I may as well hand them

42:04.173 --> 42:06.436
a condom and a cigarette
to go with it.

42:06.480 --> 42:09.962
You know, I came
all the way down here.

42:10.005 --> 42:11.877
The least you could do
is offer me an opinion.

42:11.920 --> 42:14.532
I thought we agreed it was best
for you to not come here.

42:14.575 --> 42:17.360
And I thought you needed
to be out in seven days.

42:17.404 --> 42:20.407
I need to know how this delay
is going to affect things.

42:20.450 --> 42:25.064
Well, it won't be comfortable,
but it will be possible.

42:25.107 --> 42:26.587
Oh, well, thank
you, James,

42:26.631 --> 42:29.547
but that doesn't exactly
ravage me with confidence.

42:29.590 --> 42:30.765
And what would?

42:30.809 --> 42:32.593
Your ass on a plane.

42:32.637 --> 42:33.942
Four more days.

42:33.986 --> 42:38.643
If I'm out of here by then,
I can still do it.

42:40.122 --> 42:43.212
Trust me. It'll be fine.

42:43.256 --> 42:45.780
I'll let the brothers know.

42:49.610 --> 42:51.438
[sighs]

42:51.481 --> 42:52.700
Gretchen.

42:53.962 --> 42:55.877
About Sofia...

42:55.921 --> 42:58.140
She's fine.

42:58.184 --> 43:01.187
Burrows is taking
real good care of her.

43:01.970 --> 43:03.668
Good luck, James.
