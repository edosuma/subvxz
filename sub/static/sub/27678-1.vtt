06:57.117 --> 06:59.651
     What are you going to      
     do after we graduate?      

07:00.087 --> 07:02.154
     - Smoke the odd joint?     

07:02.556 --> 07:04.556
         Come on, dude.         

07:04.558 --> 07:07.726
 You're not going to go to some 
 big city, be a famous artist?  

07:07.728 --> 07:10.862
        Me and Faith buy        
    tickets to your gallery?    

07:10.864 --> 07:12.030
             - Hmm.             

07:12.032 --> 07:14.533
        Rather chill on         
      your yacht, Cornell.

              man.              

07:29.516 --> 07:30.215
              No.               

07:30.217 --> 07:31.716
        - It's alright.         

07:31.718 --> 07:33.685
  - Don't be a pussy, Hunter.   

07:33.687 --> 07:35.053

       His parents home?        

07:48.802 --> 07:49.668
           - Parent.

           Singular.            

07:51.238 --> 07:53.672

   - Might want to make it 5.   

08:06.253 --> 08:08.019
      - The way I play, it      
      probably will be 5.

        too easy for me.        

08:51.231 --> 08:54.132
  - [Male] Man, I've memorized  
        all the combos.         

08:54.134 --> 08:55.066

10:10.644 --> 10:12.744
You got something to hide, Todd?

- Do you want to smoke or what? 

10:15.349 --> 10:16.881
       - You've still got       
        this thing, huh?

     peace with my misery.

  - Well, I can't promise you   
   guys that this will air.

- [Reporter] And we do have an  
update on that traffic accident 

17:38.291 --> 17:39.757
  that happened this morning.   

17:39.759 --> 17:42.393
       Unfortunate, there       
        was a fatality.         

17:42.395 --> 17:43.161
           Oh, jeez.            

17:43.163 --> 17:44.162
        That's horrible.        

17:44.164 --> 17:45.530
  No names have been released.  

17:45.532 --> 17:48.099
     Apparently there was a     
     skateboarder involved.     

17:48.101 --> 17:50.168
    Please, drive carefully     
     this morning, folks.       

17:51.404 --> 17:52.403
       - Mrs. Hunter, hi.       

17:52.405 --> 17:53.805
  I'm Lance Winters from WDFD.  

17:53.807 --> 17:55.573
        Do you have any         
    comment on the incident     

17:55.575 --> 17:59.577
 today involving your son, the  
  incident from this morning?   

17:59.579 --> 18:01.279
             Just--             

18:01.281 --> 18:02.713
            - Luke!             

18:04.818 --> 18:05.750
             Luke!              

18:08.354 --> 18:09.287
             Luke!              

18:13.326 --> 18:14.258
            Oh, no!             

18:15.595 --> 18:16.527
            Oh, god!            

18:18.364 --> 18:19.230
            Oh, no!             

18:21.701 --> 18:23.568
             Luke!              

18:23.570 --> 18:26.270
              Oh.               

18:26.272 --> 18:27.371
            My baby.            

18:29.642 --> 18:30.575
              Oh.               

18:34.614 --> 18:37.548
              God.              

18:43.590 --> 18:44.489
         - Stan's dead.         

18:50.897 --> 18:52.330
          Stan, Stan.           

18:55.335 --> 18:57.668
             Stan.              

18:57.670 --> 18:58.603
        - [Mary] Oh, no.        

19:01.241 --> 19:04.175
       I'm sorry, honey.        

19:04.177 --> 19:06.544
        - I have to go.         

19:06.546 --> 19:07.311
           - Oh, god.           

19:07.313 --> 19:08.246
         I'm so sorry.          

19:10.884 --> 19:13.484
       I gave you the one       
      with the real sugar.      

19:15.355 --> 19:17.321
      - [Luke] Thank you.       

19:17.323 --> 19:18.789
    - Honey, you didn't have    
            anything            

19:18.791 --> 19:21.626
     to do with Stan dying,     
            did you?            

19:24.464 --> 19:26.464
          Okay, Okay.           

19:26.466 --> 19:29.500
       And then, the news       
       truck outside is--       

19:29.502 --> 19:30.735
       what's that about?       

19:34.841 --> 19:36.807
             Yeah.              

19:36.809 --> 19:37.909
            Oh, god.            

19:42.715 --> 19:45.650
      Well, my yoga class       
        was full today.         

19:45.652 --> 19:46.584
         That was good.         

19:51.524 --> 19:53.558
       And there was this       
        elderly lady who        

19:53.560 --> 19:59.263
   let out a volcanic fart in   
    the middle of the class     

19:59.265 --> 20:04.869
   I was trying not to bust a   
   rib from laughing so hard.   

20:20.553 --> 20:24.488
         (Luke sobbing)         

20:31.864 --> 20:34.765
  A miner whose name is being   
 withheld pending notification  

20:34.767 --> 20:36.500
      of next of kin was        
      killed this morning       

20:36.502 --> 20:38.469
  when he was struck by a van.  

20:38.471 --> 20:41.639
  But this wasn't just another  
    deadly traffic accident.    

20:41.641 --> 20:44.809
   Today's tragic events were   
   predicted in stark detail    

20:44.811 --> 20:47.945
      last night by local       
      teen, Luke Hunter.        

20:49.015 --> 20:53.517
On the way to school, one of you
 is going to get hit by a van-- 

20:53.519 --> 20:55.620
        and-- and-- die.        

20:57.457 --> 21:00.424
      Out of state plates.      

21:00.426 --> 21:02.393
     Blood on the sidewalk.     

21:02.395 --> 21:04.629
- [Lance] And while the video's 
     authenticity has yet       

21:04.631 --> 21:07.431
      to be verified, Luke      
       Hunter has refused       

21:07.433 --> 21:09.467
   requests for an interview.   

21:09.469 --> 21:10.901
      The teen's startling      
        premonition was         

21:10.903 --> 21:12.436
       caught on tape at        
        a friend's home         

21:12.438 --> 21:14.538
 the night before the accident. 

21:14.540 --> 21:18.476
  It would seem that for now,   
 Stokum's own prophet of death  

21:18.478 --> 21:21.712
      is keeping all his        
    predictions to himself.     

21:21.714 --> 21:24.548
     This is Lance Winters      
     on the scene for WDFD.     

21:26.319 --> 21:27.885
     - You're smoking pot?      

21:30.623 --> 21:31.589
          - Seriously?          

21:37.930 --> 21:39.897
- Ugh, Doug, you're missing the 
            point.              

21:45.371 --> 21:47.738
        (music playing)         

22:35.021 --> 22:36.620
 - [Luke] I wasn't even friends 
           with him.            

22:36.622 --> 22:41.125
      - Luke, honey, just       
      go up and get him.        

22:41.127 --> 22:44.528
          - [Luke] No.          

22:44.530 --> 22:45.529
    - [Doug] Here he comes.     

22:45.531 --> 22:46.630
       - [Mary] Oh, good.       

22:52.538 --> 22:53.771
      - [Doug] Hey, Todd.       

22:53.773 --> 22:54.772
   - [Todd] Hey, Mr. Hunter.    

22:54.774 --> 22:57.041
     - [Doug] Yeah, been a      
            while.              

22:57.043 --> 22:57.975
          - Hi, honey.          

22:57.977 --> 22:59.610
          - Hi, Mary.           

22:59.612 --> 23:00.478
        Those are cool.         

23:00.480 --> 23:01.145
          I dig those.          

23:01.147 --> 23:02.146
        - I make these.         

23:02.148 --> 23:03.013
        - [Fang] Really?        

23:03.015 --> 23:04.081
            - Yeah.             

23:04.083 --> 23:05.616
   Why don't you take these.    

23:11.524 --> 23:12.523
      It has good energy.       

23:14.460 --> 23:15.393
          - Thank you.          

23:21.134 --> 23:25.970
- [Priest] It's always difficult
   when a young person dies.    

23:25.972 --> 23:30.441
 We want to focus on that life  
  that ended too quickly when   

23:30.443 --> 23:32.843
    life is taken from us...    

23:32.845 --> 23:35.413
     (somber music playing)     

24:06.813 --> 24:09.880
       (sermon muffled in       
        the background)         

25:12.111 --> 25:13.110
            - Luke?             

25:13.112 --> 25:14.612
        (taps on window)        

25:14.614 --> 25:16.013
     How were you able to       
     predict Stan's death?      

25:16.015 --> 25:17.948
    Is it something you've      
    always been able to do?     

25:17.950 --> 25:19.950
        Have you had any        
        more predictions        

25:19.952 --> 25:21.952
     that you're just not       
    telling us about, Luke?     

25:21.954 --> 25:22.887
             Luke?              

25:24.056 --> 25:25.823
      - You've seen those       
      nature videos where       

25:25.825 --> 25:29.693
 the cameraman gets too close   
to the mama and her cubs, yeah? 

25:29.695 --> 25:30.628
           - Come on.           

25:30.630 --> 25:31.295
     - Have a blessed day.      

25:48.214 --> 25:49.146
       (door slams shut)        

26:05.698 --> 26:06.630
  (stan grunts in frustration)  

26:28.354 --> 26:30.287
     - Oh, look who it is--     

26:30.289 --> 26:32.723
 profit of death in the flesh.  

26:32.725 --> 26:35.893
    - What I don't get is,      
    if you knew about Stan,     

26:35.895 --> 26:36.827
    why didn't you stop it?     

26:41.934 --> 26:42.866
      [locker slams shut]       

26:44.670 --> 26:45.603
      - Go for it, freak.       

27:03.289 --> 27:04.888

            lights.             

27:31.717 --> 27:33.651
        - That's $4.75          

27:35.121 --> 27:37.287
              Hey,              
    you're that prophet guy.    

27:37.289 --> 27:38.822
        - Oh, no, no, I-        

27:38.824 --> 27:41.058
   - [Attendant] You're also    
            not 18.             

27:41.060 --> 27:43.160
        - I am in, like,        
       four months, dude.       

27:43.162 --> 27:44.161
           Seriously?           

27:47.433 --> 27:48.365
      - Tell me my future.      

27:51.137 --> 27:51.935
      - I'm not a psychic.      

27:51.937 --> 27:53.337
           - Come on.           

27:53.339 --> 27:54.438
    I saw you predict your      
   friend's death on the TV.    

27:54.440 --> 27:55.939
            - Jesus.            

27:55.941 --> 27:58.375
    - Come on, do the thing,    
      and these are yours.      

27:58.377 --> 28:00.444
         - Fine, fine.          

28:09.255 --> 28:10.154
     You have a girlfriend?     

28:10.156 --> 28:11.121
            - Yeah.             

28:11.123 --> 28:12.156
        Yes, she's new.         

28:12.158 --> 28:14.191
            - Okay.

            - Jenny.            

28:15.828 --> 28:16.827
     - Jenny, Jenny, yeah.      

28:16.829 --> 28:19.296
   Jenny's hair, it's r- b--    

28:19.298 --> 28:20.064
           - Blonde?            

28:20.066 --> 28:21.398
         Dirty blonde?          

28:21.400 --> 28:25.402
    - Yeah, and-- oh, dude,     
    she's with another guy.     

28:25.404 --> 28:27.705
     They're in this room,      
  their hotel room taking off   

28:27.707 --> 28:29.039
     each other's clothes.      

28:29.041 --> 28:32.342
    Oh, man, he's got, like,    
     candles, scented and--     

28:32.344 --> 28:33.377
          that sucks.           

28:33.379 --> 28:35.112
          Sorry, man.           

28:35.114 --> 28:36.246
   She has nice tits, though.   

28:57.203 --> 28:58.268
  (high pitched buzzing sound)  

28:58.504 --> 29:04.341
      Hey, I made that up.      

29:06.212 --> 29:07.344
             Sorry.

        (knock on door)         

29:15.187 --> 29:16.987
             - Hi.              
             - Hi.              

29:16.989 --> 29:18.088
  - Sorry to bother you, sir.   

29:18.090 --> 29:20.090
        I don't know if         
       you know who I am.       

29:20.092 --> 29:20.991
       I live over there.       

29:20.993 --> 29:22.459
    - You think I'm stupid?     

29:22.461 --> 29:23.293
       Of course, I know.       

29:23.295 --> 29:24.528
       You're Doug's boy.       

29:24.530 --> 29:26.063
            - Great.            

29:26.065 --> 29:27.431
     OK, hey, I have to do      
    some yard work for you.     

29:27.433 --> 29:29.099
            - What?             

29:29.101 --> 29:31.835
- I mean, I have to do community
    service work for school.    

29:31.837 --> 29:33.203
         I have to help         
       out an old person.       

29:33.205 --> 29:34.338
     - What are you saying?     

29:34.340 --> 29:36.273
       - I have to clean        
       your gutters, sir.       

29:36.275 --> 29:37.307
   May I clean your gutters?    

29:37.309 --> 29:38.142
  - You want to clean gutters?  

29:38.144 --> 29:38.909
             - Yes.             

29:38.911 --> 29:39.543
        Yes, thank you.         

29:39.545 --> 29:42.780
          - No, I do.           

29:42.782 --> 29:43.814
          No, no, no.           

29:43.816 --> 29:44.982
    - I have to, or I won't     
           graduate.            

29:44.984 --> 29:47.484

29:52.191 --> 29:53.991
         - Fine, fine.          

29:53.993 --> 29:55.292
          - Thank you.          

29:55.294 --> 29:56.493
          - Crazy kid.          

29:56.495 --> 29:57.995
       - OK, I'm going to       
        use your ladder.        

29:57.997 --> 29:59.630

     rhymes on the swift.¶

  and I operate with style.¶

30:27.193 --> 30:28.125
       - What's up, Hank?       

30:28.127 --> 30:28.992
         - Hey, amigo.          

30:28.994 --> 30:31.028
        What's going on?        

30:31.030 --> 30:34.431
 - Oh, you know, not too much,  
             man.               

30:34.433 --> 30:35.299
   - [Hank] Good to see you.    

30:35.301 --> 30:36.233
           - You too.           

30:39.004 --> 30:42.606
    - Just dropping this off    
           actually.            

30:42.608 --> 30:44.141
       - What's this for.       

30:44.143 --> 30:46.443
    - It's what Stan said he    
    owes you for the shirts.    

30:46.445 --> 30:49.112
       - Oh, yeah, right.       

30:49.114 --> 30:51.248
God, it's a strange thing, man. 

30:52.184 --> 30:53.317
     Well, not God, death.      

30:56.088 --> 30:59.156
Well, God's a strange thing too.

30:59.158 --> 31:00.257
  They're both strange, dude.   

31:00.492 --> 31:02.092
            - Yeah.             

31:04.864 --> 31:09.299
 - You know, I never met anyone 
    that was alive as Stan.     

31:09.301 --> 31:12.302
    Makes you wonder, where     
    did all that energy go?     

31:15.140 --> 31:18.342
- Listen, I'm glad you came by. 

31:18.344 --> 31:20.377
      I actually got this       
       for you and Stan.        

31:20.379 --> 31:21.912
          - Oh, what?           

31:21.914 --> 31:22.646
         - [Hank] Yeah.         

31:26.018 --> 31:27.618
          - Oh, shit.           

31:27.620 --> 31:28.969
        Dinosaur Junior.        

31:28.970 --> 31:30.319
  - [Hank] Show's next month.   

31:30.322 --> 31:31.355
          - Thank you.          

31:31.357 --> 31:32.222
- Yeah, you have fun with that. 

31:32.224 --> 31:33.090
         - Thanks, man.         

31:33.092 --> 31:34.124
             - Yep.             

31:34.126 --> 31:35.425
           - See you.           

31:35.427 --> 31:36.493
  - Hey, don't be a stranger.   

31:36.495 --> 31:37.928
        It's good having        
        you around, man.        

31:37.930 --> 31:40.264
        (music playing)         

31:57.483 --> 32:01.451
   - Hey, let me know if you    
   have any more prophecies.    

32:01.987 --> 32:03.954
Yo, made solid coin on the last 
             one.               

32:03.956 --> 32:04.521
            - Luke.             

32:04.523 --> 32:06.456
           I didn't-            

32:07.393 --> 32:08.325
             Luke.              

32:25.611 --> 32:29.613
        Hey, there's no         
     music in the library.      

32:29.615 --> 32:31.381
         - Oh, my bad.          

32:33.719 --> 32:35.686
     - You're Luke, right?      

32:35.688 --> 32:38.388
   I'm friends with your mom.   

32:38.390 --> 32:39.489
            - Yeah?             

32:39.491 --> 32:41.224
- [Rachel] Friends of Lake Erie.

32:41.226 --> 32:45.429
 - Oh, yeah, my mom is a huge   
 Erie fan, all the Great Lakes  

32:45.431 --> 32:46.430
            really.             

32:46.432 --> 32:49.166
  She doesn't pick favorites.   

32:52.004 --> 32:55.238
 - Hey, how are you holding up? 

32:56.175 --> 32:57.107
            - Fine.             

32:58.444 --> 33:01.511
  - You don't have to be, you   
             know?              

33:01.513 --> 33:03.580
 Losing someone's really tough. 

33:06.385 --> 33:07.317
           - Totally.           

33:10.122 --> 33:13.056
 - Well, you know where to find 
  me if you ever want to talk.  

33:25.571 --> 33:28.171
   - This is a great starting   
             point.             

33:28.173 --> 33:32.009
     Jim is gonna develop a     
  subconscious attraction her.  

33:32.011 --> 33:33.343
        So you need to          
      move closer to her.       

33:33.345 --> 33:35.112
      You're going to put       
     your arms around her.      

33:35.114 --> 33:36.580
          OK, move in.          

33:36.582 --> 33:38.215
    I need to see some grip.    

33:38.217 --> 33:39.449
          There we go.          

33:39.451 --> 33:41.618
      I need you face to        
      face, not so close.       

33:41.620 --> 33:43.320
          That's good.          

33:43.322 --> 33:44.788
      You're going to keep      
       your eye contact.        

33:44.790 --> 33:46.289
       Faith, I need you        
        to get present.         

33:46.291 --> 33:47.057
           Come back.           

33:47.059 --> 33:48.558
         There you go.          

33:48.560 --> 33:49.326
         - I got to go.         

33:49.328 --> 33:50.293
           I'm sorry.           

34:16.789 --> 34:20.223
- [Mary] Dinner's in the fridge 
   if you want to eat later.    

34:21.159 --> 34:22.092
           - Thanks.            

34:25.464 --> 34:29.232
    - Fang came by the house    
      today after school.       

34:31.103 --> 34:32.402
          He's skinny.          

34:32.404 --> 34:34.071
   He doesn't look so great.    

34:34.072 --> 34:36.339
      - Yeah, what's new?       

34:36.341 --> 34:37.340
- [Mary] You should go see him. 

34:40.679 --> 34:41.610
            - Pass.             

34:51.389 --> 34:52.422
        Can I help you?         

34:58.430 --> 35:03.300
     - You know, your Uncle     
  Steven, he had vivid dreams.  

35:03.302 --> 35:06.236
     He had premonitions, I     
     guess, you could say.      

35:10.843 --> 35:13.276
     - Maybe he should have     
      played the lottery.       

35:13.278 --> 35:14.578
 Wouldn't have been such a bum. 

35:17.282 --> 35:19.249
       - He wasn't a bum.       

35:19.251 --> 35:23.453
    He was my brother, and      
    he was super sensitive,     

35:23.455 --> 35:28.892
and he was an artist, like you. 

35:31.797 --> 35:35.398
       And sometimes, he        
      was scary accurate.       

35:35.400 --> 35:39.836
    And other times, it was     
     more of a projection.      

35:39.838 --> 35:44.508
  But he made a choice to shut  
  out the world and people who  

35:44.510 --> 35:45.609
           loved him.           

35:51.750 --> 35:54.718
    I love you too much to      
    let that happen to you.     

36:09.268 --> 36:11.334
          You hear me?          

36:17.609 --> 36:18.542
        - Love you too.

       Check his vitals.        

37:29.815 --> 37:31.881
 (Mrs. Bernoffski sobs loudly)  

38:09.321 --> 38:11.388
      - You've been a hard      
        person to find.         

38:12.824 --> 38:16.893
  - Yeah, not unintentionally.  

38:19.631 --> 38:21.698
     - All right, I'll stop     
        distracting you.        

38:24.469 --> 38:25.735
            - Yeah.             

38:25.737 --> 38:27.070
   - Yeah, I should probably    
       get back to work.

 You have one unheard message.  

40:03.835 --> 40:05.135
     First unheard message.     

40:05.137 --> 40:07.003
 - [Female] Hello, Mr. and Mrs. 
            Hunter.             

40:07.005 --> 40:10.173
     This is Rachel Woodley     
  calling from Jefferson High.  

40:10.175 --> 40:12.876
      Luke has been absent      
      almost consistently       

40:12.878 --> 40:15.578
     over the past several      
        weeks and will          

40:15.580 --> 40:17.480
 be suspended if he is not in-- 

40:17.482 --> 40:18.198
         (phone beeps)          

40:18.199 --> 40:18.915
  - [Female] Message deleted.

        End of messages.        

40:22.954 --> 40:26.623
   - [Mary] I think he should   
      see a psychologist.       

40:26.625 --> 40:29.125
 - [Doug] No, I don't think he  
 needs to see a psychologist.   

40:29.127 --> 40:32.829
I think he needs to stop smoking
   pot, focus on his grades.    

40:32.831 --> 40:36.099
 Otherwise, college isn't even  
 going to be an option for him. 

40:36.101 --> 40:38.067
 - [Mary] Well, he's mentioned  
         art schools.           

40:38.069 --> 40:39.903
    I know he loves his art.    

40:39.905 --> 40:41.538
    That could-- you know--     

40:41.540 --> 40:43.139
 - [Doug] I understand he loves 
              art.              

40:43.141 --> 40:45.008
      But to be honest, I       
      would prefer that he      

40:45.010 --> 40:47.710
    got an actual education.    

40:47.712 --> 40:50.713
Mentioning art schools doesn't  
translate into applying anyway. 

40:50.715 --> 40:54.451
 - [Mary] I just don't want him 
     to shut himself down.      

40:54.453 --> 40:55.785
    He's been through a lot.    

40:55.787 --> 40:58.588
    First, his friend dies,     
    and then Mr. Bernoffski.    

40:58.590 --> 41:02.492
    It's a hell of a lot for    
     someone to go through.     

41:02.494 --> 41:03.860
     - [Doug] I understand.     

41:03.862 --> 41:05.929
      And it's not that I       
   don't believe in therapy.    

41:05.931 --> 41:08.731
     I don't think therapy      
     is the problem here.       

41:10.135 --> 41:13.770
 - [Mary] I don't know-- well,  
 then we're just spinning our   
            wheels.             

41:13.772 --> 41:14.988
    - [Doug] No, we're not.     

41:14.989 --> 41:16.205
  - [Mary] I'm saying he needs  
        to communicate.         

41:16.208 --> 41:17.474
     He needs to express--      

41:17.476 --> 41:18.208
       - I can hear you.        

41:20.946 --> 41:21.978
    Stop worrying about me.     

41:21.980 --> 41:22.912
           I'm fine.            

41:26.051 --> 41:27.650
      (r&b music playing)       

41:27.652 --> 41:28.618
       ¶ (SINGING) Hey.¶        

41:33.024 --> 41:33.957
           ¶ Oh, oh.¶           

41:38.964 --> 41:46.936
      ¶ Baby, I would like      
      to know you better.¶      

41:46.938 --> 41:49.906
          ¶ Come on.¶           

41:49.908 --> 41:59.949
   ¶ Tell me, when can we get   
  to heaven and be all alone?¶  

42:02.821 --> 42:07.056
   ¶ Come over to my place.¶    

42:07.993 --> 42:09.058
     - You never came back.     

42:10.595 --> 42:11.661
        - I didn't know.        

42:27.178 --> 42:29.245
           Oh, Jesus.           

42:29.948 --> 42:32.582
      - No, just your mom.      

42:32.584 --> 42:34.984
         Hand it over.          

42:34.986 --> 42:37.120
      Hand over your pot.       

42:37.122 --> 42:40.189
 - What, no, I don't have any.  

42:40.191 --> 42:41.291
      - Right, OK, get up.      

42:41.293 --> 42:42.592
 - I smoked it all last night.  

42:42.594 --> 42:43.159
           - Get up.            

42:43.161 --> 42:44.928
        - It's Saturday.        

42:44.930 --> 42:46.963
     - I don't care if it's     
  Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.  

42:46.965 --> 42:48.331
  You're coming with me today.  

42:48.333 --> 42:50.833
   - [Luke] I don't wanna go.   

42:51.770 --> 42:54.771
    - We are going to live.     

42:54.773 --> 42:55.805
     Meet me in 10 minutes.     

43:00.879 --> 43:01.945
         (Luke groans)          

43:04.215 --> 43:05.281
          You got it?           

43:07.152 --> 43:09.319
       - Feels so good to       
        be outside, huh?        

43:09.321 --> 43:13.022
    - Oh, yeah, endless joy.    

43:13.024 --> 43:15.925
 - Well, I figure we'll do this 
    for a couple more hours.    

43:15.927 --> 43:21.764
 And then I made an appointment 
   for Bikram yoga, 2:00 PM.    

43:22.701 --> 43:25.201
       Joke-- I'm joking.       

43:25.203 --> 43:27.337
  - I guess I forgot to laugh.  

43:28.273 --> 43:31.641
      - You gotta be nice       
      to me today, okay?        

43:31.643 --> 43:34.177
       You hot-boxed your       
        room, remember?         

43:35.113 --> 43:37.113
- You gonna tell dad about that?

43:38.049 --> 43:38.915
            - Mary.             

43:38.917 --> 43:40.650
         - Hi, Rachel.          
             - Hi.              

43:40.652 --> 43:41.884
    I'm so glad you made it.    

43:41.886 --> 43:43.019
       - Nice to see you.       

43:43.021 --> 43:44.020
      - You remember Luke.      

43:44.022 --> 43:44.787
          - Of course.          

43:44.789 --> 43:46.122
       - Hey, Ms. Banks.        

43:46.124 --> 43:48.091
    - Thank you guys so much    
    for coming and helping.     

43:48.093 --> 43:49.659
        - Oh, of course.        

43:49.661 --> 43:52.195
      - They say that the       
      lake's on the mend.       

43:52.197 --> 43:54.163
        But those algae         
      blooms last summer--      

43:54.165 --> 43:54.931
          - Oh, gosh.           

43:54.933 --> 43:56.399
            I know.             

43:56.400 --> 43:57.866
- The report said you could see 
 them all the way from space.   

43:57.869 --> 43:59.369
      - The pollution is        
      just heartbreaking.       

43:59.371 --> 44:00.703
      - Yeah, it's awful.       

44:04.409 --> 44:07.677
- You know, I'm actually on the 
  committee for the One Drum    

44:07.679 --> 44:11.014
       Festival, and we         
     need some volunteers.      

44:11.016 --> 44:13.416
        You know, maybe         
       an artist or two.        

44:13.418 --> 44:15.385
        - Oh, an artist?        

44:15.387 --> 44:17.053
            - Yeah.             

44:17.055 --> 44:19.255
            - What?             

44:19.257 --> 44:21.791
     - Well, I mean, maybe      
 volunteering isn't your thing. 

44:21.793 --> 44:26.229
         But since you          
      already have fans--       

44:26.231 --> 44:27.964
   - That looks great on you.   

44:27.966 --> 44:30.833
  - I thought maybe you could   
 design something for One Drum. 

44:30.835 --> 44:31.901
           - Design?            

44:31.903 --> 44:33.903
         - Okay, maybe.         

44:33.905 --> 44:34.871
            - Yeah?             

44:34.873 --> 44:35.805
            - Yeah?             

44:35.974 --> 44:38.675
       - All right, cool.       

44:42.414 --> 44:43.780
 - [Male] I'd like to announce  
         the winners            

44:43.782 --> 44:45.882
        of last month's         
          fundraiser.           

44:45.884 --> 44:49.786
      First place, with a       
     total of $2,484 raised     

44:49.788 --> 44:51.921
by Luke Hunter and Stan Miller. 

44:52.857 --> 44:57.026
The distant second, Sean Lynch  
and Will Vanegan raised $1,080. 

44:57.028 --> 45:00.263
  And in third, Amber Owen and  
   Tyler Fare raised $1,480.    

45:00.265 --> 45:01.464
          - Did you--           

45:01.466 --> 45:02.298
       - Every last one.        

45:02.300 --> 45:03.466
          It was wild.          

45:03.468 --> 45:05.735
         (bell sounds)          

45:06.438 --> 45:07.370
            - When?             

45:07.372 --> 45:11.974
  - Past couple of days, this   
     morning a little bit.      

45:11.976 --> 45:13.710
      Some friends helped.      

45:13.712 --> 45:14.777
         - Shit, dude.          

45:16.815 --> 45:17.747
           Thank you.           

45:19.918 --> 45:20.983
           You okay?            

45:24.489 --> 45:27.090
        - Next question.        

45:27.092 --> 45:28.024
              You?              

45:31.229 --> 45:32.161
        - Next question.        

45:36.067 --> 45:37.767
   - I just really miss him.    

45:56.421 --> 45:57.954
        (locks clatter)         

46:03.928 --> 46:04.894
        (knock on door)         

46:09.901 --> 46:11.167
        - Hey, brother.         
           What's up?           

46:11.169 --> 46:12.001
   - [Luke] What's up, dude?    

46:12.003 --> 46:13.503
         - How are you?         

46:13.505 --> 46:14.437
          - Good, man.          

46:14.439 --> 46:17.907
   Hey, thinking about making   
   some prints of this, just,   

46:17.909 --> 46:20.176
       like, 50 shirts,         
    simple black and white.     

46:20.178 --> 46:22.145
      - Yeah, well, we do       
      have the technology.      

46:22.147 --> 46:23.312
             - OK.              

46:23.314 --> 46:25.214
       - See you went the       
      two-word thing, hey?      

46:25.216 --> 46:27.884
- Well, you won't want people to
get bored, quit reading halfway 

46:27.886 --> 46:29.218
       through it, right?       

46:29.220 --> 46:30.520
   - It's a nice design if I    
    clean up just a couple      

46:30.522 --> 46:32.121
      of things over here.      

46:32.123 --> 46:33.189
        It'll look good.        

46:34.826 --> 46:36.392
You still doing it tonight, man?

46:38.797 --> 46:40.797
- [Hank] Dude, don't tell me you
            forgot.             

46:40.799 --> 46:41.998
            - What?             

46:42.000 --> 46:42.999
   - [Hank] Dinosaur Junior.    

46:43.001 --> 46:44.167
          - Oh, shit.           

46:44.169 --> 46:45.501
          Right, yeah.          

46:45.503 --> 46:47.136
   - It's going to be insane.   

46:47.138 --> 46:48.871
         - Yeah, yeah.          

46:48.873 --> 46:50.239
     - Who you gonna take?      

46:50.241 --> 46:51.440
   You got a honey lined up?    

47:21.506 --> 47:22.538
             - Hey.             

47:22.540 --> 47:24.507
Freezing my balls off out there.

47:29.514 --> 47:30.580
        Nice shirt, man.        

47:32.584 --> 47:34.217
             Hello?             

47:34.219 --> 47:35.551
      - I didn't say shit       
       to that reporter.        

47:40.058 --> 47:40.990
           - Thanks.            

47:46.030 --> 47:48.397
     - [Fang] What is this?     

47:48.399 --> 47:49.332
           - Come on.           

47:54.939 --> 47:56.372
- [Fang] These are for tonight. 

47:56.374 --> 47:57.406
    - Yeah, Captain Obvious.    

47:57.408 --> 47:58.341
        We going or not?        

48:04.449 --> 48:07.550
       - Do you want to         
      smoke before we go?       

48:07.552 --> 48:11.520
  - I heard weed is a gateway   
             drug?              

48:11.522 --> 48:14.123
    - To what-- Mickey D's?     

48:15.560 --> 48:17.627
  - I was thinking Pizza Hut.   

48:23.101 --> 48:25.401
   - Hey, when was the last     
  time you climbed something?   

48:29.307 --> 48:30.339
       - School probably.       

48:44.355 --> 48:46.088
   Never did get to Gandy's.    

49:11.482 --> 49:12.448
         (horns honks)          

49:28.466 --> 49:29.432
      - Where you headed?       

49:33.171 --> 49:35.071
        - Grand Rapids.         

49:35.073 --> 49:36.038
         - That works.          

49:57.462 --> 49:59.228
       - Technically, I'm       
        a dwarf, but I'm        

49:59.230 --> 50:01.530
 on the tall end of the scale,  
  in case you were wondering.   

50:04.635 --> 50:06.435
       Name's Little Bob.       

50:06.437 --> 50:09.005
       What should I call       
        you two bandits?        

50:09.407 --> 50:11.107
            - Luke.             

50:11.109 --> 50:12.108
         - [Fang] Fang.         

50:12.110 --> 50:13.075
            - Fang?             

50:13.077 --> 50:14.744
        Like the teeth?         

50:14.746 --> 50:16.045
        - [Fang] Mm-hmm.        

50:16.047 --> 50:18.114
    - Huh, that's a new one.    

50:21.019 --> 50:23.085
   - You two hitchhike often?   

50:24.422 --> 50:26.422
         - Not really.          

50:26.424 --> 50:29.191
      - Your parents know       
       you hitchhiking?         

50:29.193 --> 50:32.061
         - Not really.          

50:32.063 --> 50:34.530
   - Kids your age probably     
   shouldn't be hitchhiking.    

50:34.532 --> 50:37.066
   - A guy your size probably   
      should be picking up      
          hitchhikers.          

50:37.068 --> 50:39.568
      [little bob laughs]       

50:39.570 --> 50:41.670
    - Yeah, you're probably     
       right about that,        

50:41.672 --> 50:43.506
    but I can't help myself.    

50:43.508 --> 50:45.741
         I like people.         

50:46.677 --> 50:48.611
     - People are assholes.     

50:48.613 --> 50:50.146
     [little bob chuckles]      

50:50.148 --> 50:53.082
     - Yeah, probably right     
        about that too.         

50:56.487 --> 50:58.120
     I wasn't going to let      
 anything stop me from getting  

50:58.122 --> 50:59.722
     my commercial license.     

50:59.724 --> 51:04.627
 You can't let things hold you  
 back, not people, rules, fear. 

51:04.629 --> 51:06.462
       Fear is a big one.       

51:06.464 --> 51:10.366
    That one-- he's afraid.     

51:11.769 --> 51:12.701
            - Yeah?             

51:16.674 --> 51:18.641
     What is he afraid of?      

51:18.643 --> 51:19.508
          - He hides.           

51:19.510 --> 51:20.643
          I can tell.           

51:20.645 --> 51:22.144
  I'm good at spotting them--   

51:22.146 --> 51:22.778
      folks with secrets.       

51:22.780 --> 51:23.813
       (car horn blaring)       

51:23.815 --> 51:25.347
        Watch the road!         

51:25.349 --> 51:27.249
             Jesus!             

51:27.251 --> 51:28.117
           All right.           

51:28.119 --> 51:30.386
      Watch the road, man!      

51:30.388 --> 51:31.654
   - [Little Bob] We're good.   

51:31.656 --> 51:33.222
     - Yo, my best friend       
    died because some bitch     

51:33.224 --> 51:34.457
    wasn't paying attention.    

51:37.328 --> 51:38.327
     - Sorry to hear that.      

51:43.334 --> 51:50.339
     - I knew it was gonna      
  happen, every detail of it.   

51:51.275 --> 51:52.208
             - Wow.             

51:55.680 --> 52:00.883
 - I thought it was just stupid 
      bullshit in my head.      

52:00.885 --> 52:02.184
   - Has it happened before?    

52:02.186 --> 52:04.787
 - Stupid bullshit in my head?  

52:04.789 --> 52:06.555
         All the time.          

52:07.758 --> 52:09.758
      Ever killed anybody       
        because of it?          

52:12.597 --> 52:19.168
  - Look, I spend my time, my   
 life looking out on this road, 

52:19.170 --> 52:21.370
       thinking all sorts       
       of crazy thoughts.       

52:21.372 --> 52:24.240
        I imagine a deer        
          jumping out,          

52:24.242 --> 52:28.210
   car swerving into my lane,   
       trees falling over       

52:28.212 --> 52:30.346
   just as I'm about to pass.   

52:31.282 --> 52:33.816
    Point is, I can't swerve    
    like a madman, convinced    

52:33.818 --> 52:35.184
 the worst is going to happen.  

52:35.186 --> 52:36.385
  That'd make me certifiable.   

52:36.387 --> 52:38.454
      That's just the mind      
        telling stories.        

52:41.526 --> 52:43.692
    We can't control what's     
  going to come into our lane.  

52:47.231 --> 52:48.797
       Can't control it.        

52:50.401 --> 52:51.333
          You hear me?          

52:54.438 --> 52:55.371
            - Yeah.             

52:56.440 --> 52:58.774
   (band playing rock music)    

53:25.736 --> 53:28.304
      (LEAD SINGER SINGING      
         INDISCERNIBLY)         

53:34.312 --> 53:35.711
              Hey!              

53:35.713 --> 53:37.713
           Hey, Fang!           

53:37.715 --> 53:38.714
             Fang!              

53:38.716 --> 53:39.682
        Can you hear me?        

53:39.684 --> 53:40.616
              Hey!              

54:00.238 --> 54:01.237
             Fang!              

54:01.239 --> 54:01.971
             Fang!              

54:04.242 --> 54:05.341
           Hey, hey!            

54:07.678 --> 54:09.511
 - Looks like an asthma attack. 

54:09.513 --> 54:10.579
   - He doesn't have asthma.    

54:12.516 --> 54:14.650
           You okay?            
           You okay?            

54:14.652 --> 54:16.952
       Oh, Jesus Christ!        
       Oh, Jesus Christ!        

54:16.954 --> 54:18.787
  Look, did you take anything?  

54:18.789 --> 54:19.588
    Look at me, look at me.     

54:19.590 --> 54:20.522
        - [Faith] Fang?         

54:24.629 --> 54:27.997
 I think he's hyperventilating. 

54:27.999 --> 54:30.566
             Here.              

54:30.568 --> 54:32.935
       Hey, just breathe.       

54:36.941 --> 54:38.907
    (Fang breathing rapidly)    

54:41.512 --> 54:44.713
- He's okay. He's frickin' okay.

54:50.888 --> 54:53.656
     Are you sure you don't     
       wanna go back in.        

54:53.658 --> 54:54.556
           We're OK.            

54:54.558 --> 54:56.492
    You're OK, right, Fang?     

54:56.494 --> 54:58.594
Yeah, I'm sure the smoke helps. 

54:58.596 --> 54:59.895
         - No, please.          

54:59.897 --> 55:02.965
      I'm actually really       
     glad I found you guys.     

55:02.967 --> 55:05.934
 My sister flaked on me, like,  
   the second we got there.     

55:05.936 --> 55:07.836
     Probably went to bang      
    her douchebag boyfriend     

55:07.838 --> 55:08.771
    in his douchebag truck.     

55:11.509 --> 55:14.943
   It's my fault. I should've   
    have asked her to come.     

55:14.945 --> 55:17.079
       I got the tickets        
       for Stan and me.         

55:20.718 --> 55:24.353
       - My tickets were        
      for Stan and I too.       

55:25.089 --> 55:26.021
            - Weird.            

55:55.953 --> 55:57.886
You doing good back there, Fang?

55:58.522 --> 55:59.455
            - Fine.             

56:04.929 --> 56:08.597
      - I know this sounds      
       weird, but do you        

56:08.599 --> 56:14.069
 think Stan was looking down no 
  us tonight and maybe brought  

56:14.071 --> 56:15.437
      us together somehow?      

56:22.680 --> 56:23.612
            - Shit.             

56:26.117 --> 56:28.784
            - Fang?             

56:28.786 --> 56:30.119
           You good?            

56:30.121 --> 56:31.387
   - [Faith] Yeah, of course.   

56:36.594 --> 56:37.593
   - [Officer] Good evening.    

56:37.595 --> 56:38.894
  Any alcohol in the vehicle.   

56:38.896 --> 56:40.362
     - [Faith] No, officer.     

56:40.363 --> 56:41.829
   - [Officer] There's a bad    
   accident near Clearwater.    

56:41.832 --> 56:44.400
    An oil tanker derailed,     
       highway's closed.        

56:44.402 --> 56:45.868
Where are you folks coming from?

56:45.870 --> 56:47.636
- We're trying to get to Stokum.

56:47.638 --> 56:49.471
  - [Officer] Well, you're not  
   getting to Stokum tonight.   

56:49.473 --> 56:50.789
        Maybe tomorrow.         

56:50.790 --> 56:52.106
  You can turn around up here.  

56:52.109 --> 56:53.509
         Take it easy.          

56:53.511 --> 56:54.443
          Drive safe.           

56:56.514 --> 56:58.480
        (music playing)         

57:11.462 --> 57:13.195
   I'm gonna call my parents.   

57:30.514 --> 57:32.514
    - Do you have any money?    

57:32.516 --> 57:33.582
       - [Fang] For what?       

57:33.584 --> 57:35.784
       - For gas, Faith.        

57:35.786 --> 57:37.052
         - [Fang] Why?          

57:37.054 --> 57:38.720
  - Because she just drove us.  

57:38.722 --> 57:39.688
    Do you have cash or not?    

57:42.193 --> 57:43.192
             Fang?              

57:43.193 --> 57:44.192
     - [Fang] In my jacket.     
          - Thank you.          

57:46.931 --> 57:48.997
     What's wrong with you.     

57:59.210 --> 58:00.142
             Luke.              

58:07.485 --> 58:09.651
       She's Stan's girl.       

58:14.592 --> 58:15.524
          - I'm aware.          

58:21.765 --> 58:22.865
   Think I should go for it?    

58:22.867 --> 58:24.132
         (Fang laughs)          

58:27.538 --> 58:30.606
    Don't you just love me?     

58:30.608 --> 58:31.507
            - Fang!             

58:31.509 --> 58:33.709
     - Tell me you love me.     

58:33.711 --> 58:34.710
      Tell me you love me.      

58:34.712 --> 58:36.011
         - Oh, my God.          

58:36.013 --> 58:36.945
             - Oh!              

58:41.151 --> 58:42.117
             - Hey.             

58:42.119 --> 58:43.919
             - Hey.             

58:43.921 --> 58:45.988
  - You talk to your parents?   

58:45.990 --> 58:47.756
            - Yeah.             

58:47.758 --> 58:50.225
 - I mean, my dad's upset that  
    I'm at a random hotel       

58:50.227 --> 58:51.093
         with two guys.         

58:51.095 --> 58:51.960
           - For gas.           

58:51.962 --> 58:53.829
        - Oh, thank you.        

58:53.831 --> 58:55.797
 But he's happy that I'm safe.  

58:55.799 --> 58:57.132
            - Good.             

58:57.134 --> 58:59.268
     Oh, you probably don't     
     want to go back there.     

58:59.270 --> 59:00.202
         - Oh, why not?         

59:03.007 --> 59:04.606
      Is he taking a bath?      

59:04.608 --> 59:06.642
         - Apparently.          

59:06.644 --> 59:08.210
     Shouldn't be too long.     

59:11.048 --> 59:13.115
     - You sure he's okay?      

59:14.718 --> 59:19.788
  - I don't know what's going   
     on with him anymore.       

59:19.790 --> 59:21.990
      - He seems pretty--       

59:21.992 --> 59:24.226
         - Screwed up?          

59:24.228 --> 59:25.160
              Yep.              

59:27.598 --> 59:30.065
  - You guys have been friends  
      for a while, right?       

59:30.668 --> 59:32.000
     - Since kindergarten.      

59:36.206 --> 59:39.274
         Hey, um, whoa.         

59:43.681 --> 59:45.714
 - Oh, in case of emergencies.  

59:45.716 --> 59:47.115
   - Do you always just have    
       bottles of booze         

59:47.117 --> 59:48.083
        in your pockets?        

59:48.085 --> 59:50.285
- No, I got it for the concert. 

59:50.287 --> 59:51.954
             - Oh.              

59:51.956 --> 59:54.756
          Yeah, sure.           

59:54.758 --> 59:55.657
           - Cheers.            

59:55.659 --> 59:56.625
        (glasses clink)         

59:57.094 --> 59:58.026
           - Cheers.            

01:00:04.034 --> 01:00:06.668
      And how about Fang's      
        climbing, right?        

01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:07.336
          - Oh, yeah.           

01:00:07.338 --> 01:00:08.637
        He was a legend.        

01:00:08.639 --> 01:00:11.940
 - He was going to climb this.  

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:12.874
        - Gangy's Rock?         

01:00:14.612 --> 01:00:16.945
      - People die there.       

01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:18.280
      - That kid Julian--       

01:00:18.282 --> 01:00:19.047
          - Gonzalez.           

01:00:19.049 --> 01:00:20.048
       - Gonzalez, yeah.        

01:00:20.050 --> 01:00:22.117
 - Yeah, like, four years ago.  

01:00:22.753 --> 01:00:24.186
   - I mean, I hate heights.    

01:00:24.188 --> 01:00:25.120
           - Me too.            

01:00:35.366 --> 01:00:36.298
            Come on.            

01:00:39.069 --> 01:00:40.068
      Where are we going?       

01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:42.037
    (Luke and Faith giggle)     

01:00:52.383 --> 01:00:54.950
        (music playing)         

01:01:30.154 --> 01:01:31.219
      - That was awesome.       

01:01:32.756 --> 01:01:33.689
           Thank you.           

01:01:39.096 --> 01:01:43.999
       - Is it true you         
      knowing about Stan?       

01:01:51.709 --> 01:01:53.341
    - Does that bother you?     

01:01:53.343 --> 01:01:58.113
       - No, not really.        

01:01:59.316 --> 01:02:03.118
 I mean, he really liked doing  
 that teacher thing with you.   

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:07.022
     I think you guys had a     
    deeper connection that--    

01:02:07.024 --> 01:02:12.227
    I don't know-- sent him     
  further than we understand.   

01:02:17.301 --> 01:02:18.834
  I had fun with you tonight.   

01:02:24.475 --> 01:02:26.241
        - Yeah, me too.         

01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:28.376
 - Did you ever go to visit him 

01:02:29.747 --> 01:02:31.980
         at his grave?          

01:02:38.322 --> 01:02:39.387
           - Do you?            

01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:42.224
            - Yeah.             

01:02:46.296 --> 01:02:47.229
  - [Luke] What was that like?  

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:51.233
           - Lonely.            

01:03:03.881 --> 01:03:05.847
    ¶ (SINGING) Do you have     
      to let it linger?¶        

01:04:22.159 --> 01:04:24.025
  - [Broadcaster] Good morning  
            America.            

01:04:24.027 --> 01:04:26.294
  Today is confession Monday.   

01:04:26.296 --> 01:04:27.462
       - [Female] Uh-oh.        

01:04:27.463 --> 01:04:28.629
- [Male] We haven't done this in
            awhile.             

01:04:28.632 --> 01:04:30.365
 - [Male] Set the ground rules, 
           will you?            

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:33.068
- [Male] All right, we want you 
      to call and confess       

01:04:33.070 --> 01:04:35.204
         this morning.          

01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:37.339
Whatever it is that you've done 
 that you haven't told anyone,  

01:04:37.341 --> 01:04:38.373
        you can tell us.        

01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:40.408
   - All right, tell your dad   
            thanks.             

01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:42.410
      Next time, I'll stay      
      at the Four Seasons.      

01:04:44.181 --> 01:04:45.914
         OK, all right.         

01:04:45.916 --> 01:04:46.648
              Bye.              

01:04:58.028 --> 01:04:59.427
       - Was that a girl?       

01:04:59.997 --> 01:05:00.929
              No.               

01:05:03.267 --> 01:05:04.332
             Maybe.             

01:05:04.334 --> 01:05:06.534
            - Yeah?             

01:05:06.536 --> 01:05:09.104
      So what is her name?      

01:05:09.106 --> 01:05:10.639
         - It's Faith.          

01:05:10.641 --> 01:05:13.408
   She was Stan's girlfriend.   

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:16.077
          - Oh, I see.          

01:05:20.484 --> 01:05:22.117
         - Okay, relax.         

01:05:22.119 --> 01:05:24.119
    She's just using me to      
   keep Stan's memory alive.    

01:05:24.121 --> 01:05:27.122
   - Oh, don't sell yourself    
       so short, honey.         

01:05:27.124 --> 01:05:29.424
     You are so beautiful.      

01:05:29.426 --> 01:05:31.559
          Back, away.           

01:05:31.561 --> 01:05:33.161
             - No.              

01:05:33.163 --> 01:05:35.463
   - It just takes the right    
   girl to know who you are.    

01:05:35.465 --> 01:05:37.065
            - Stop.             

01:05:37.067 --> 01:05:38.266
     You're such a weirdo.      

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:39.601
          Stop, stop.           

01:05:39.603 --> 01:05:41.002
             Stop.              

01:05:41.004 --> 01:05:43.238
   - Yeah, could you imagine    
       if I was normal?         

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:44.472
    How bored would you be?     

01:05:48.145 --> 01:05:49.544
     - Tonight's top story,     

01:05:49.546 --> 01:05:51.212
   last night, police raided    
         McCreary Park          

01:05:51.214 --> 01:05:52.647
        after receiving         
      complaints the park       

01:05:52.649 --> 01:05:55.317
       was being used by        
   homosexuals to rendezvous.   

01:05:55.319 --> 01:05:57.218
   - Second raid this month.    

01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:59.487
     -- [Reporter] ...had       
    reported unusual amount     

01:05:59.489 --> 01:06:01.957
         of garbage and         
     intimate paraphernalia     

01:06:01.959 --> 01:06:04.292
       in and around the        
    nearby public restrooms.    

01:06:04.294 --> 01:06:05.727
       Sources within the       
       police department        

01:06:05.729 --> 01:06:08.263
say, this tip spurred the raid. 

01:06:08.265 --> 01:06:09.597
   - [Male] It's disgusting.    

01:06:09.599 --> 01:06:10.699
    We bring our dogs here.     

01:06:10.701 --> 01:06:13.601
      - Doug, are you OK?       

01:06:13.603 --> 01:06:15.270
         - [Doug] Yeah.         

01:06:15.272 --> 01:06:17.639
   - 15 Stokum residents were   
 detained here in McCreary Park 

01:06:17.641 --> 01:06:20.608
       last night under         
    suspicion of lewd acts.     

01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:22.711
       So far, no names         
      have been released.       

01:06:22.713 --> 01:06:25.680
  - Jack went on leave today.   

01:06:26.616 --> 01:06:28.683
     He left at lunchtime.      

01:06:29.753 --> 01:06:33.154
    And then two cops came,     
   and they spoke with Tracy.   

01:06:33.423 --> 01:06:35.123
     They went through all      
      his personal stuff.       

01:06:38.328 --> 01:06:39.694
       - [Mary] Poor Deb        
         and the kids.          

01:06:39.696 --> 01:06:42.163
      - That explains Mr.       
      Kite's Pomeranian.        

01:06:42.165 --> 01:06:43.181
         - [Doug] Hey!          

01:06:43.182 --> 01:06:44.198
 - [Reporter] Despite repeated  
           requests             

01:06:44.201 --> 01:06:46.001
       from the WDFD news       
             team,              

01:06:46.003 --> 01:06:48.370
    police have refused to      
    confirm further details     

01:06:48.372 --> 01:06:50.338
      or provide a list of      
      the individuals that      

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:51.773
 make up the McCreary Park 15.

        (thud on window)        

01:07:20.137 --> 01:07:21.436
     - You know the rules?      

01:07:21.438 --> 01:07:23.438
 - Of course, I know the rules. 

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:24.272
      Winner gets a wish.       

01:07:24.274 --> 01:07:25.173
            - What?             

01:07:25.175 --> 01:07:27.575
              Oh!               

01:07:27.577 --> 01:07:29.310
        - Are you okay?         

01:07:29.312 --> 01:07:30.211
            - Yeah.             

01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:31.479
             Yeah.              

01:07:31.481 --> 01:07:32.781
              OK.               

01:07:32.783 --> 01:07:34.115
         - Oh, my God.          

01:07:34.117 --> 01:07:36.084
        You're bleeding.        

01:07:36.086 --> 01:07:37.352
           - Oh, man.           

01:07:37.354 --> 01:07:40.155
        - So generally,         
    there's usually a signal    

01:07:40.157 --> 01:07:41.790
       or a countdown to        
        let the players         

01:07:41.792 --> 01:07:43.091
   know the game has started.   

01:07:43.093 --> 01:07:44.426
          - I'm sorry.          

01:07:44.428 --> 01:07:48.663
     - Also, head shots--       
   generally not encouraged.    

01:07:48.665 --> 01:07:50.398
     - I didn't know there      
      were actual rules.        

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.434
   I thought we just flicked    
    the ball at each other.     

01:07:52.436 --> 01:07:53.601
          - It's okay.          

01:07:53.603 --> 01:07:55.603
       It's not that bad.       

01:07:55.605 --> 01:07:56.738
 - You haven't seen your face.  

01:07:59.676 --> 01:08:01.376
      My wish is you come       
       to dance with me.        

01:08:07.818 --> 01:08:12.487
    - You know, technically,    
     you haven't won, so--      

01:08:12.489 --> 01:08:13.588
         - Yes, I did.          

01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:14.422
           I hit you.           

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:16.124
      - No-- in the face.       

01:08:16.126 --> 01:08:17.425
   - Don't complicate things.   

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:18.493
       - All right, fine.       

01:08:18.495 --> 01:08:19.359
         Twist my arm.

01:08:26.803 --> 01:08:28.368
         Hey, I got it.         

01:08:28.371 --> 01:08:29.337
        - No, no, I do.         

01:08:29.339 --> 01:08:30.537
    - [Luke]  I don't mind.     

01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:32.173
        - You leave it.         

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:35.676
        - I don't mind.         

01:08:35.679 --> 01:08:37.278
        Have a good day.

01:20:19.081 --> 01:20:20.414
     (grunts, blows landed)     

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:32.993
    - [Dwight] Bet you're on    
      McCreary Park list.       

01:20:35.998 --> 01:20:36.964
         (Luke groans)          

01:21:14.904 --> 01:21:17.238
 (VOCALIZING TO NATIVE AMERICAN 
            DRUMBEAT)           

01:21:40.062 --> 01:21:42.029
      (rock music playing)      

01:22:17.333 --> 01:22:18.599
         (Luke retches)         

01:22:18.601 --> 01:22:20.234
          - Hey, here.          

01:22:20.236 --> 01:22:21.101
           Come here.           

01:22:21.103 --> 01:22:22.503
    I help, I help, I help.     

01:22:22.505 --> 01:22:24.972
        Oh, no, no, no.         

01:22:24.974 --> 01:22:26.407
          In, in, in.           

01:22:26.409 --> 01:22:27.574
            In, in.             

01:22:27.576 --> 01:22:29.643
              Go.               
           All right.           

01:22:33.349 --> 01:22:34.548
You think you killed my Johnny? 

01:22:46.429 --> 01:22:48.295
     - I tried to stop it.      

01:22:51.167 --> 01:22:56.370
       Every time, I do,        
      I just screw it up.       

01:22:59.308 --> 01:23:07.314
      - One thing I know,       
       we all gonna die.        

01:23:07.316 --> 01:23:09.583
    Nothing no one could do.    

01:23:09.585 --> 01:23:17.458
  Another thing I know, it's    
  God who decides when we go,   

01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:20.394
       not the little boy       
        down the street.        

01:23:23.099 --> 01:23:28.402
      My Johnny is a proud      
       man, stubborn man.       

01:23:28.404 --> 01:23:34.775
    He's gonna do what he's     
  gonna do, but he die happy.   

01:23:34.777 --> 01:23:38.512
       He live good life.       

01:23:38.514 --> 01:23:41.548
         Now, you rest.         

01:23:41.550 --> 01:23:43.350
     I make you cup of tea.     

01:23:53.729 --> 01:23:54.661
  (Luke exhales exasperatedly)  

01:25:07.803 --> 01:25:09.169
        (knock on door)         

01:25:09.171 --> 01:25:10.237
          - Hey Faith!          

01:25:12.141 --> 01:25:12.873
       (knocking on door)       

01:25:16.278 --> 01:25:17.377
           I'm sorry.           

01:25:17.379 --> 01:25:18.445
       I need your help.        

01:25:18.447 --> 01:25:19.813
          - Call 911.           

01:25:19.815 --> 01:25:21.315
    - [Luke] I need a ride.     

01:25:21.317 --> 01:25:22.549
         - Call a taxi.         

01:25:22.551 --> 01:25:25.719
      - I think Fang might      
      do something stupid.      

01:25:28.424 --> 01:25:29.456
    - You think or you know?    

01:25:29.458 --> 01:25:30.390
           - I know.            

01:25:31.861 --> 01:25:32.793
            I know.             

01:25:37.166 --> 01:25:37.898
           Thank you.           

01:25:40.636 --> 01:25:42.569
          Fang, Fang!           

01:25:48.777 --> 01:25:50.544
            Get up.             

01:25:50.546 --> 01:25:52.212
     We gotta go right now.     
             - No.              

01:25:52.214 --> 01:25:53.247
          We gotta go.          
             - No.              

01:25:53.249 --> 01:25:53.914
            Get up.             

01:25:53.916 --> 01:25:54.848
             - Why?             

01:25:58.754 --> 01:25:59.686
         - [Luke] Here.         

01:26:02.424 --> 01:26:03.357
          Get dressed.          

01:26:04.393 --> 01:26:05.526
     Come on, get dressed.      

01:26:09.698 --> 01:26:10.631
            - Dude.             

01:26:16.238 --> 01:26:18.805
        Come on, you're         
       really losing it!        

01:26:18.807 --> 01:26:19.806
          What'd I do?          

01:26:19.808 --> 01:26:21.175
          - I saw it.           

01:26:21.177 --> 01:26:22.709
       You're losing it.        

01:26:22.711 --> 01:26:24.578
  You thought you could kill    
 yourself and I wouldn't know?  

01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:25.946
   - You're really losing it.   

01:26:25.948 --> 01:26:26.914
        - That's funny.         

01:26:26.916 --> 01:26:28.448
  - These prophecies and shit.  

01:26:28.450 --> 01:26:29.983
        - I'm losing it?        

01:26:29.984 --> 01:26:31.517
  it's not real, it's not real. 
    - Look at me, look at me.   

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:32.286
        - It's not real!        

01:26:32.288 --> 01:26:33.487
         - Look at me.          

01:26:34.523 --> 01:26:37.191
    I know what's going on.     

01:26:37.193 --> 01:26:38.292
      No, no, no, no, no.       

01:26:38.294 --> 01:26:39.259
    I know what's going on.     

01:26:39.261 --> 01:26:40.194
      - You have no clue.       

01:26:42.598 --> 01:26:43.497
       You have no clue.        

01:26:56.512 --> 01:26:58.879
      The intervention is       
   supposed to be next week.    

01:26:58.881 --> 01:27:00.480
       - Yeah, hilarious.       

01:27:00.482 --> 01:27:01.281
            Come on.            

01:27:01.283 --> 01:27:02.216
         - [Fang] Here.         

01:27:09.625 --> 01:27:10.490
          - [Luke] Go.          

01:27:10.492 --> 01:27:11.425
      (Car engine starts)       

01:27:22.004 --> 01:27:22.936
     - [Fang] Gandy's Rock?     

01:27:26.942 --> 01:27:28.542
      - [Luke] Wait here.       

01:27:28.544 --> 01:27:30.410
     - [Faith] Wait, Luke?      

01:27:30.412 --> 01:27:31.845
             Luke?              

01:27:31.847 --> 01:27:33.447
   Please, tell me you guys     
  aren't going to climb this.   

01:27:33.449 --> 01:27:35.616
 - Everything's going to be OK. 

01:27:35.618 --> 01:27:36.550
           Trust me.            

01:27:43.325 --> 01:27:45.259
       You got this, man.       

01:27:45.261 --> 01:27:46.960
   Concentrate, pick a route.   

01:27:50.633 --> 01:27:53.600
   - You want me to fall, or    
    do you want me to jump?     

01:27:53.602 --> 01:27:54.901
         That would be          
      pretty spectacular.       

01:27:54.903 --> 01:27:58.705
       - Hey, look at me.       

01:27:58.707 --> 01:28:01.575
         Up then down.          

01:28:01.577 --> 01:28:02.509
           That's it.           

01:28:05.948 --> 01:28:07.414
        You're going to         
       climb this thing.        

01:28:09.918 --> 01:28:11.852
     Things can be better.      

01:28:11.854 --> 01:28:13.820
    I need you to see that.     

01:28:15.824 --> 01:28:16.757
      - You do it with me.      

01:28:22.798 --> 01:28:23.730
            - Fine.             

01:28:25.801 --> 01:28:26.733
             Fine.              

01:28:40.349 --> 01:28:42.716
     (gentle music playing)     

01:29:22.624 --> 01:29:23.957
         - [Luke] Shit.         

01:29:23.959 --> 01:29:24.825
             - Hey.             

01:29:24.827 --> 01:29:26.593
            - Fang!             
            - Shit.             

01:29:28.564 --> 01:29:29.563
         Come on, man.          

01:29:29.565 --> 01:29:30.430
            Come on.            

01:29:30.432 --> 01:29:32.065
        - Grab my hand.         

01:29:32.067 --> 01:29:33.433
      - [Fang] I got you.       

01:29:33.435 --> 01:29:34.968
     Right leg, left left.      

01:29:34.970 --> 01:29:36.903
          Right there,          
          you're good.          

01:29:36.905 --> 01:29:38.839
        You can do this.        

01:29:38.841 --> 01:29:39.773
            Come on.            

01:29:40.776 --> 01:29:41.742
            Come on.            

01:30:13.609 --> 01:30:14.674
           Right arm.           

01:30:14.676 --> 01:30:15.675
            Come on.            

01:30:15.677 --> 01:30:16.877
  It's not that much farther.   

01:30:20.115 --> 01:30:21.448
          Nice, dude.           

01:30:21.450 --> 01:30:22.182
            Come on.            

01:30:27.089 --> 01:30:27.954
           I got you.           

01:30:27.956 --> 01:30:29.156
            Come on.            

01:30:29.158 --> 01:30:30.524
             Yeah.              

01:30:30.526 --> 01:30:31.191
         Yeah, come on.         

01:30:31.193 --> 01:30:32.125
      You're almost there.      

01:30:39.902 --> 01:30:41.067
           We did it.           

01:30:41.069 --> 01:30:42.736
           We did it.           

01:30:42.738 --> 01:30:44.004
            Come on!            
             Yeah!              

01:30:44.006 --> 01:30:45.605
              Woo!              

01:30:45.607 --> 01:30:49.676
              Woo!              

01:30:58.554 --> 01:31:00.554
          Hey, Faith.           

01:31:00.556 --> 01:31:01.621
    ( yelling triumphantly)     

01:31:04.193 --> 01:31:06.159
          Yeah, baby!           

01:31:06.161 --> 01:31:09.095
         Stokum sucks!          

01:31:09.097 --> 01:31:10.030
             Yeah!              

01:31:16.638 --> 01:31:21.875
              Ow!               
              Woo!              

01:31:30.552 --> 01:31:33.753
    They're publishing this     
  list of names in the paper.   

01:31:38.093 --> 01:31:39.025
            - What?             

01:31:43.532 --> 01:31:45.999
- They're publishing this list  
of names in the paper tomorrow. 

01:31:52.608 --> 01:31:56.042
   You know the men who got     
 arrested up in McCreary Park?  

01:31:56.979 --> 01:31:59.546
 Well, Jack called me, and he   
said that it would be tomorrow. 

01:32:02.784 --> 01:32:04.818
 - [Luke] Who the hell is Jack? 

01:32:06.221 --> 01:32:07.220
             Kite.              

01:32:07.823 --> 01:32:13.293
  Jack Kite, your dad's boss.   

01:32:13.295 --> 01:32:17.230
      - Why would my dad's      
      boss call you, Fang?      

01:32:17.232 --> 01:32:20.000
     Why would he call you?     

01:32:20.002 --> 01:32:20.934
     - Because I know him.      

01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:25.739
Because my name is on the list. 

01:33:09.985 --> 01:33:13.787
   - [Luke] You know, I could   
    stick around for a bit,     

01:33:13.789 --> 01:33:14.921
    hang out if you wanted.     

01:33:14.923 --> 01:33:17.057
        - No, no, dude.         

01:33:17.059 --> 01:33:17.891
        Get out of here.        

01:33:17.893 --> 01:33:18.825
           I'm cool.            

01:33:21.897 --> 01:33:24.331
    - [Luke] That was really    
         bad-ass, man.          

01:33:24.333 --> 01:33:26.232
   You are a friggin bad-ass.   

01:33:26.234 --> 01:33:28.034
         That was sick.         

01:33:28.036 --> 01:33:29.169
- You think people are going to 
    start calling me Todd       

01:33:29.171 --> 01:33:30.937
         at school now?         

01:33:30.939 --> 01:33:34.708
   Because that's, like, way    
       gayer than Fang..        

01:33:34.710 --> 01:33:36.109
    - [Luke] Whatever, man.     

01:33:36.111 --> 01:33:38.712
  I'll take them out for you.   

01:33:38.714 --> 01:33:39.713
   - Have you seen your face?   

01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:46.720
        I love you, man.        

01:33:46.722 --> 01:33:47.654
    - [Luke] I love you too.    

01:33:53.829 --> 01:33:55.195
- [Fang] I'll see you tomorrow, 
             man.               

01:34:20.822 --> 01:34:24.391
     - Hey, look, I'm sorry     
       about everything,        

01:34:24.393 --> 01:34:28.728
     about today, One Drum.     

01:34:28.730 --> 01:34:30.430
       I'm really sorry.        

01:34:30.432 --> 01:34:31.931
  I've been a real ass lately.  

01:34:34.436 --> 01:34:35.368
       - Yeah, you have.        

01:34:43.912 --> 01:34:45.078
    But you're not a loser.     

01:34:49.284 --> 01:34:50.350
           - Thanks.            

01:34:54.322 --> 01:34:56.389
       I guess I'll see         
      you at school, huh?       

01:34:58.760 --> 01:34:59.693
            - Yeah.             

01:35:04.866 --> 01:35:05.799
          - Allright.           

01:35:15.444 --> 01:35:16.209
              Bye.              

01:35:16.211 --> 01:35:17.143
             - Bye.             

01:35:33.195 --> 01:35:34.127
              Hey.              

01:35:36.798 --> 01:35:37.731
        - [Faith] Yeah?         

01:35:47.175 --> 01:35:48.041
              Bye.              

01:35:48.043 --> 01:35:48.975
         - [Faith] Bye.         

01:35:54.182 --> 01:35:56.916
     - What if cut just an      
      inch or something?        

01:35:56.918 --> 01:35:57.784
             - Mom.             

01:35:57.786 --> 01:35:58.451
            - What?             

01:35:58.453 --> 01:36:00.787
      - You're so pretty.       

01:36:00.789 --> 01:36:01.454
           - Come on.           

01:36:01.456 --> 01:36:03.189
     - You really want to--     

01:36:03.191 --> 01:36:04.390
           - Pretty?            

01:36:04.392 --> 01:36:05.859
         OK, now, it's          
     definitely going off.      

01:36:05.861 --> 01:36:06.793
      - It's a big change.      

01:36:06.795 --> 01:36:09.095
           - I know.            

01:36:09.097 --> 01:36:10.997
             - OK.              

01:36:10.999 --> 01:36:11.898
        - Are you sure?         

01:36:11.900 --> 01:36:13.767
             - Yes.             

01:36:13.769 --> 01:36:14.768
  - That's your final answer?   

01:36:18.006 --> 01:36:21.975
  You've got a lot of courage.  

01:36:33.355 --> 01:36:34.354
         - Thanks, mom.         

01:36:34.356 --> 01:36:35.922
   - Still look pretty to me.   

01:36:56.278 --> 01:36:57.243
         There you are.         

01:37:03.285 --> 01:37:04.284
       What do you think?       

01:37:04.286 --> 01:37:05.218
              Aw.               

01:37:05.220 --> 01:37:07.120
        (music playing)         

01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:51.064
      - [Luke Voiceover]        
       Yeah, we all die.        

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.434
   But first, we get to live.   

01:37:55.370 --> 01:37:57.470
        And that's big.         

01:37:57.472 --> 01:37:59.072
       That's beautiful.        

01:38:00.542 --> 01:38:02.141
    That's not to be missed.    

01:38:16.224 --> 01:38:26.232
   ¶ (SINGING) Ooh, someone     
 somewhere's waiting for you.¶  

01:38:26.234 --> 01:38:31.571

¶ Even when the wind blows, you 
sigh as you're going my way.¶

       ¶ Won't be long.¶        

01:40:18.046 --> 01:40:22.015
     ¶ You and I can dance      
      in the driveway.¶         

01:40:22.017 --> 01:40:28.421
      ¶ Just let our song
