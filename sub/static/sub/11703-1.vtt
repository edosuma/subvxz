00:04.259 --> 00:06.820
Bea Smith was today
sentenced for the murder of...

00:06.820 --> 00:07.919
- ... Brayden Holt.
- Absent, of course...

00:07.919 --> 00:09.480
... is crime patriarch, Vinnie Holt,

00:09.480 --> 00:11.836
Who collapsed and died after
the funeral of his son...

00:11.836 --> 00:14.160
... Brayden. Mother, and
convicted murderer, Bea Smith...

00:14.160 --> 00:16.556
... faced to the Supreme
Court today for sentencing.

00:16.556 --> 00:18.960
She remained unrepentant to the end.

00:18.960 --> 00:21.359
Do you have anything to
say before I pass sentence?

00:21.359 --> 00:23.359
Brayden Holt took my daughter's life.

00:23.600 --> 00:24.797
So I took his.

00:25.018 --> 00:26.797
And I'd do it all again.

00:26.797 --> 00:29.559
Smith's story has generated
massive public sympathy,

00:29.559 --> 00:33.658
she took on and destroyed on of
Melbourne's most-feared crime families,

00:33.658 --> 00:35.780
in revenge for the death
of her daughter, Debbie.

00:35.780 --> 00:37.740
Justice Nichols remained unmoved,

00:37.740 --> 00:40.600
sentencing Smith to life without parole,

00:40.600 --> 00:43.859
she will spend the rest
of her days behind bars.

00:43.859 --> 00:45.859
You're so courageous, Bea!

00:46.658 --> 00:49.060
I would've done the same thing!

00:50.960 --> 00:52.899
How do you feel about your sentencing, Bea?

00:53.840 --> 00:54.740
Bea!

00:55.039 --> 00:56.737
We believe in you!

01:06.120 --> 01:07.840
How do you feel about your sentencing, Bea?

01:07.840 --> 01:09.840
Do you have anything to say, Bea?

01:09.840 --> 01:11.840
Governor Ferguson, for the
last four months, she's...

01:11.840 --> 01:13.858
She's taken away all the
inmates' privileges...

01:13.858 --> 01:14.938
she's been punishing...

01:14.938 --> 01:17.700
the women for what I've
done, and it's gotta stop!

01:17.700 --> 01:19.620
You're our hero, Bea!

01:19.620 --> 01:21.620
You're our hero!

01:27.680 --> 01:30.920
The Chairman of the Board of
Correctional Services, Victoria,

01:30.920 --> 01:34.120
maintains that Governor
Ferguson has their full support.

01:34.120 --> 01:35.578
Have you read this report?

01:35.578 --> 01:37.578
I compiled it, Mr. Chairman.

01:38.840 --> 01:42.200
"Prisoner organized a distraction
to steal a security card."

01:42.200 --> 01:44.760
"Prisoner accessed mail
room with stolen card...

01:44.760 --> 01:46.420
in order to steal a box cutter."

01:46.420 --> 01:49.239
"Prisoner slashed own wrists
in order to avoid cuffing..."

01:49.239 --> 01:52.438
"Prisoner escaped from hospital
while undergoing treat for injuries."

01:52.438 --> 01:54.438
And all of this on your watch!

01:54.438 --> 01:57.799
I believe the hospital is, actually,
outside my sphere of influence.

01:57.799 --> 01:59.340
It was one of your officers...

01:59.340 --> 02:01.757
who was meant to be on
guard. Do I need to go on?

02:01.938 --> 02:03.757
Since Smith's escape,

02:03.757 --> 02:05.959
I have instituted punitive measures.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.037
Too late!

02:09.240 --> 02:11.580
You've lost control of your prison!

02:13.860 --> 02:16.740
If it wasn't for your loyal
support of Mr. Channing, here...

02:16.740 --> 02:18.120
you wouldn't have a job.

02:18.258 --> 02:20.120
Now, you are on notice, Governor.

02:20.120 --> 02:21.740
One more stuff up,

02:21.740 --> 02:23.740
and you'll be stripped of your appointment.

02:24.419 --> 02:26.500
Do I make myself clear?

02:27.860 --> 02:30.157
However with the ground swell of support...

02:30.157 --> 02:32.157
in and out of the prison for Bea Smith,

02:32.157 --> 02:33.479
the question remains...

02:33.479 --> 02:36.098
- Governor?
- ... how will Governor Ferguson keep control?

02:38.280 --> 02:39.180
She's back.

03:57.580 --> 03:59.098
G'day, Di.

04:14.318 --> 04:15.759
What's she doing in here?

04:15.759 --> 04:16.836
Clothes.

04:18.720 --> 04:21.040
- Like to watch, do you?
- Now, Smith.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.519
That's the last time you'll
be wearing those clothes.

04:28.740 --> 04:31.838
Might as well donate them
to someone who can use them.

04:39.660 --> 04:41.259
Underwear.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.000
Getting off yet?

04:54.220 --> 04:55.220
Ears.

04:56.759 --> 05:00.180
Whatever little acts of
defiance you care to try,

05:01.060 --> 05:04.379
I'd think very carefully before you
do anything without my permission.

05:04.560 --> 05:06.560
When are you going to
reinstate the privileges?

05:06.560 --> 05:07.399
Arms.

05:08.399 --> 05:10.720
Taking it out on everyone isn't fair.

05:10.720 --> 05:13.379
Before you get completely
carried away playing Jesus,

05:13.379 --> 05:16.160
Just spare a thought for Liz Birdsworth?

05:16.420 --> 05:18.639
She's rotting away in
protection because of you.

05:18.639 --> 05:19.600
Do you think that's fair?

05:19.819 --> 05:20.699
Feet.

05:25.259 --> 05:26.838
You step out of line...

05:27.259 --> 05:29.160
there will be consequences.

05:29.160 --> 05:31.160
You are the property of Wentworth.

05:31.800 --> 05:33.500
And this is my prison.

05:33.778 --> 05:34.920
Bend over.

05:40.939 --> 05:43.040
Look, here. Here.

05:43.040 --> 05:46.199
Oh, that is lovely, that is!

05:46.199 --> 05:48.199
- Oh, look!
- See? That's the head there...

05:48.778 --> 05:50.920
- Is he sucking his thumb?
- Yeah!

05:51.399 --> 05:53.519
I don't know if it's a
boy or a girl, though.

05:53.519 --> 05:56.600
- I don't wanna know.
- Oh, no, it's good to have a surprise.

05:56.778 --> 05:58.040
How ya feeling?

05:58.040 --> 05:59.879
Yeah, I'm good, actually.

05:59.879 --> 06:02.800
- I'm nervous.
- You are gonna be fine.

06:02.800 --> 06:05.860
I'm supposed to nominate an
alternate carer for the baby.

06:05.860 --> 06:07.860
I wish you were still in general.

06:07.860 --> 06:09.300
Me too, love.

06:10.199 --> 06:12.160
Have you heard how Bea went today?

06:12.160 --> 06:13.519
No, no idea.

06:13.519 --> 06:16.399
- No telly, no radio...
- It's been months.

06:16.939 --> 06:20.519
Everyone's right pissed off at Ferguson.
Look, I reckon it's gonna get ugly.

06:20.660 --> 06:22.639
It's probably a good thing you're in here.

06:22.959 --> 06:23.959
Yeah...

06:23.959 --> 06:26.399
Coz in here, I've just got
the weirdos and kiddie killers,

06:26.399 --> 06:28.060
and out there, people want to kill me.

06:28.060 --> 06:28.740
Look,

06:28.740 --> 06:31.100
- At least you're safe, eh?
- Hmm.

06:32.740 --> 06:33.939
How's Franky?

06:58.920 --> 07:00.519
Enjoying, you perv?

07:00.519 --> 07:03.778
Why don't you take a picture,
mate. It lasts longer.

07:03.980 --> 07:05.278
Freak.

07:08.259 --> 07:09.720
Check out the delivery.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.019
Yeah, cool.

07:12.160 --> 07:16.180
Um, we've got... pumpkin...

07:16.180 --> 07:17.680
Chickens...

07:17.680 --> 07:19.680
Cauliflower, and...

07:19.680 --> 07:21.680
- What are they, carrots?
- Yeah, carrots.

07:21.680 --> 07:22.278
Chickens.

07:22.278 --> 07:24.278
- Chickens...
- Yeah, chickens, yeah.

07:24.278 --> 07:26.278
A bunch of 'em.

07:26.560 --> 07:27.379
Why?

07:31.920 --> 07:33.160
What are you doing?

07:34.060 --> 07:35.819
What is she doing?

07:35.819 --> 07:38.199
C'mon, stick your finger in there.

07:39.639 --> 07:40.720
Right up there.

07:40.720 --> 07:43.740
- It's disgusting.
- Can you feel anything?

07:43.740 --> 07:46.879
- Well, yeah, but...
- Ah, settle down.

07:46.879 --> 07:49.100
I don't know. Just the
giblets and shit, why?

07:49.100 --> 07:50.778
Grab them.

07:54.160 --> 07:55.699
What the fuck?

07:58.778 --> 07:59.600
Franky!

08:00.579 --> 08:03.620
- You're a fucking dead set genius.
- No shit.

08:03.620 --> 08:06.680
The screws will never
think of looking in there.

08:06.680 --> 08:07.720
Well, you know...

08:07.720 --> 08:09.720
Not unless they're into
fist fucking dead chooks.

08:09.720 --> 08:11.079
And how was it for you?

08:11.079 --> 08:13.000
Well, that's what I love about you.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.778
You introduce me to all
these new experiences.

08:16.778 --> 08:18.300
Doyle!

08:19.439 --> 08:21.000
Governor wants a word.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.000
Okay.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.019
Good.

08:36.340 --> 08:38.399
Bit obvious, aren't you?

08:38.399 --> 08:39.557
Where's your cape?

08:39.557 --> 08:40.519
Ha!

08:44.879 --> 08:45.940
Is she back?

08:45.940 --> 08:47.940
- What'd she get?
- Life.

08:47.940 --> 08:50.778
- Without parole.
- Shit!

08:51.460 --> 08:53.340
No wonder you look stressed.

08:53.340 --> 08:55.798
She'll have made plans. Do
you know anything about them?

08:55.798 --> 08:57.080
No, nothing.

08:58.298 --> 09:00.538
We're not besties. It's
not like she shares.

09:00.538 --> 09:03.418
Well, you'll just have to
make sure she does, hmm?

09:04.100 --> 09:05.460
We had a deal.

09:05.460 --> 09:06.798
We still do.

09:06.798 --> 09:08.080
- Really?
- Hmm.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.340
Coz everything you've given me...

09:09.340 --> 09:11.158
is either information I already know...

09:11.158 --> 09:12.557
or would've undoubtedly found out...

09:12.557 --> 09:13.418
Or was just plain...

09:13.418 --> 09:15.720
- untrue.
- And what about your end of the deal?

09:15.860 --> 09:17.778
You said you'd get rid of my competitors.

09:17.778 --> 09:18.580
And I have.

09:18.580 --> 09:20.580
Except for Queen Bea.

09:20.580 --> 09:23.700
Have you forgotten about that fat ass
elephant that just walked back in the room?

09:24.700 --> 09:26.158
Well then it would help your cause...

09:26.158 --> 09:27.440
if you could give me something on her.

09:27.440 --> 09:29.080
Yeah, and yours, too.

09:31.519 --> 09:32.278
So?

09:32.798 --> 09:34.278
So?

09:36.100 --> 09:38.418
If I hear anything, I'll let you know.

09:38.418 --> 09:40.100
But I'd watch my back, if I were you.

09:40.100 --> 09:41.480
She seems to like this power thing.

09:41.480 --> 09:44.600
- Are you playing me, Doyle?
- Hey, we're all playing each other.

09:46.538 --> 09:48.440
- We finished?
- Yes.

09:48.440 --> 09:49.480
Yes, we are.

09:49.480 --> 09:51.000
I'm putting an end to our little agreement.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
You're on your own, Franky.

10:14.860 --> 10:16.019
Bea.

10:16.519 --> 10:17.639
How'd it go?

10:20.240 --> 10:21.320
How's everything here?

10:21.320 --> 10:22.940
It's all good. It's good.

10:22.940 --> 10:26.519
'Cept the girls are still
testy about their privileges.

10:26.519 --> 10:28.519
Cindy Lou isn't happy.

10:30.399 --> 10:32.980
Cindy Lou's never happy.
What is it this time?

10:32.980 --> 10:34.980
You say we get time in the kitchen.

10:34.980 --> 10:36.980
But then as soon as you go to court,

10:36.980 --> 10:38.399
Franky pulled a knife.

10:38.399 --> 10:39.918
Franky said, "fuck off!"

10:39.918 --> 10:41.918
Franky called Cindy Lou a skank.

10:42.220 --> 10:43.918
Cindy Lou is a skank.

10:44.220 --> 10:45.918
Franky runs the kitchen.

10:45.918 --> 10:47.918
If Cindy Lou wants to prepare her own food,

10:47.918 --> 10:51.158
she has to do it outside regular
meal times. You know that's the deal.

10:51.158 --> 10:53.158
But Franky told us to piss off.

10:53.158 --> 10:55.158
Okay, well, you tell Cindy Lou...

10:55.158 --> 10:57.158
that I'll deal with Franky.

10:57.158 --> 10:59.158
Alright?

11:13.085 --> 11:15.114
- Or is it his tummy?
- Oh, hey!

11:15.114 --> 11:17.123
Do you wanna see my ultrasound?

11:17.123 --> 11:18.089
Yeah.

11:20.099 --> 11:22.831
- Ah.
- Isn't it gorgeous?

11:23.412 --> 11:25.643
- Yeah.
- I sent Nash a copy...

11:25.643 --> 11:27.352
He's gonna be so rapt!

11:27.352 --> 11:28.435
Hey, do you want a cuppa?

11:28.435 --> 11:30.444
Oh, no. I'm just gonna take a moment.

11:30.727 --> 11:32.574
Okay, well let me know
if you change your mind.

11:32.574 --> 11:34.583
Thanks. Oh, hey...

11:34.583 --> 11:36.592
Can you tell Franky I want to see her?

11:36.592 --> 11:37.257
And just...

11:37.257 --> 11:38.804
keep an eye on Cindy Lou and Tina, yeah?

11:38.804 --> 11:40.552
- Make sure there's no touble?
- Of course.

11:40.552 --> 11:41.755
Hey Bea?

11:41.755 --> 11:42.340
Yeah?

11:42.359 --> 11:44.228
How'd you go this morning?

11:44.750 --> 11:46.701
I got off!

11:50.337 --> 11:53.530
- Oh Doreen, I'm so excited!
- I know...

11:53.530 --> 11:55.539
I'm so excited, too!

12:06.330 --> 12:09.344
Bea Smith is a serious offender.

12:09.686 --> 12:13.664
And how we deal with her will be
highly scrutinized by the public.

12:13.664 --> 12:17.301
And a nervous government intent
on proving they are tough on crime.

12:17.301 --> 12:21.258
If she shows the slightest signs of
resistance, you will come down hard on her.

12:21.258 --> 12:23.268
- Understood?
- Yes, Governor.

12:23.268 --> 12:25.277
She is also highly manipulative.

12:25.619 --> 12:28.874
And the moment you feel sorry for her
is the moment you know she is using you.

12:28.874 --> 12:30.884
Isn't that right, Mr. Jackson?

12:30.884 --> 12:34.641
Mr. Jackson has just returned
from four months suspension...

12:34.641 --> 12:36.650
courtesy of Bea Smith.

12:37.956 --> 12:39.925
Welcome back, Mr. Jackson.

12:40.868 --> 12:42.437
- Governor.
- One more thing...

12:42.437 --> 12:46.214
The state government has instituted
a ban on smoking in all prisons,

12:46.214 --> 12:48.605
to be phased in over
the next twelve months.

12:48.605 --> 12:50.614
We will not be phasing it in.

12:51.556 --> 12:53.566
Wentworth starts today.

12:55.797 --> 12:56.942
Is there a problem?

12:56.942 --> 12:58.530
The women are already on edge.

12:58.530 --> 12:59.975
We've taken away their telly...

12:59.975 --> 13:01.443
Restricted their visits...

13:01.443 --> 13:03.452
- We take away their fags...
- This is government policy.

13:03.452 --> 13:05.461
Are you suggesting we ignore it?

13:05.461 --> 13:08.677
Smith's actions have thrown a
spotlight on everything you do.

13:08.677 --> 13:12.555
You can tell that to the women as
you confiscate their cigarettes.

13:12.555 --> 13:13.841
Yes, Governor.

13:13.841 --> 13:15.850
That'll be all, everyone. Thank you.

13:20.169 --> 13:22.579
Look, she's asking for
trouble is all I'm...

13:22.579 --> 13:23.867
- saying.
- Yeah, and it's our job

13:23.867 --> 13:25.876
to make sure that there isn't any.

13:27.302 --> 13:29.392
This is, uh, Bridget Westfall.

13:29.392 --> 13:30.557
Will Jackson.

13:30.557 --> 13:31.861
- G'day.
- Nice to meet you.

13:31.861 --> 13:34.415
Ms. Westfall is a forensic psychologist.

13:34.415 --> 13:35.238
She's...

13:35.238 --> 13:36.927
Joined the staff on a full-time basis,

13:36.927 --> 13:39.478
to run some anti-recidivism
programs with the women.

13:39.478 --> 13:41.488
Well, there's one you
won't have to worry about.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.777
Bea Smith. Life, no parole.

13:43.777 --> 13:45.183
When did this happen?

13:45.183 --> 13:46.229
This morning.

13:46.229 --> 13:48.800
We've just returned from
the Governor's briefing.

13:55.349 --> 13:56.696
Governor?

13:57.238 --> 13:59.330
May I have a word, please?

13:59.330 --> 14:01.377
How can I help you, Ms. Westnull?

14:01.377 --> 14:02.865
Westfall.

14:03.488 --> 14:05.999
Apparently there was a
staff briefing this morning.

14:05.999 --> 14:07.284
Why was I excluded?

14:07.284 --> 14:08.650
You are not my staff.

14:08.650 --> 14:10.099
You were a board appointment.

14:10.099 --> 14:11.365
Technically, yes.

14:11.365 --> 14:13.213
But if I'm to function as part of a team,

14:13.213 --> 14:14.359
- I really feel...
- Fine, as you wish.

14:14.359 --> 14:15.543
I will include you in the future.

14:15.543 --> 14:16.388
Anything else?

14:16.388 --> 14:17.934
I should meet with Smith today.

14:17.934 --> 14:19.542
If that's alright with you?

14:19.542 --> 14:21.552
I wasn't aware she'd
requested to see a psych.

14:21.552 --> 14:24.502
It is usual procedure
after a tough sentencing.

14:24.502 --> 14:26.575
I determine procedure here, Ms. Westfall.

14:26.575 --> 14:27.820
Of course...

14:27.820 --> 14:30.573
But I think you might
be overlooking something.

14:32.399 --> 14:33.626
What would that be?

14:33.626 --> 14:37.161
The board gave me pretty clear KPIs
on the prisoners' mental health.

14:37.161 --> 14:40.458
I hope you don't intend
to obstruct that brief.

14:42.849 --> 14:45.319
You can't have it both ways, Ms. Westfall.

14:45.319 --> 14:48.555
If you wish to be a member of my
team, you'll be reporting to me.

14:48.555 --> 14:49.941
Certainly.

14:50.384 --> 14:53.254
So, may I proceed?

14:54.945 --> 14:57.133
Be very cautious with Smith.

14:57.133 --> 14:58.963
She is a manipulator.

14:58.963 --> 15:00.309
Oh, don't worry, Governor.

15:00.309 --> 15:01.494
It's at the forefront of my mind.

15:01.494 --> 15:03.141
I'm trained to deal with all types.

15:03.141 --> 15:05.975
Even those who appear to
have their shit together.

15:10.936 --> 15:13.346
No, I don't wanna see
your fucking ultrasound.

15:13.346 --> 15:14.535
Where's Red?

15:17.327 --> 15:19.597
- You wanted a word?
- Yeah.

15:19.597 --> 15:20.862
Have a seat.

15:23.054 --> 15:25.324
- Everything good in the kitchen?
- All good.

15:25.324 --> 15:26.932
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

15:26.932 --> 15:29.121
Had a totally hilarious
tea towel fight with Booms.

15:29.121 --> 15:30.468
Gave her an epic bruise.

15:30.468 --> 15:33.984
- Still actually fucking hurts...
- Oh, suck it up, princess.

15:33.984 --> 15:36.655
Yeah, but Cindy Lou,
though. She's not very happy.

15:36.655 --> 15:37.539
Is she?

15:37.539 --> 15:39.549
Well, tell her she can come back.

15:39.891 --> 15:41.760
I promise not to use
the boning knife on her.

15:41.760 --> 15:43.769
Great, thanks.

15:44.069 --> 15:45.373
No problem.

15:45.919 --> 15:47.383
Anything else?

15:48.088 --> 15:49.392
No.

15:49.917 --> 15:50.981
Oh, yeah.

15:50.981 --> 15:52.549
You're still one short on the roster?

15:52.549 --> 15:54.275
Since Kimmie got paroled, yeah.

15:54.275 --> 15:56.568
Okay, well, maybe you can
give Maxine that detail.

15:56.568 --> 15:57.549
No.

15:57.549 --> 16:00.143
- We're all good, aren't we?
- Yeah, we're so fucking good.

16:00.143 --> 16:03.176
No, it's no hassle. I'm
sure she'd love to help out.

16:05.185 --> 16:07.639
Sure.

16:08.321 --> 16:09.145
Good.

16:09.484 --> 16:11.155
- And Franky?
- Hmm?

16:11.918 --> 16:16.135
It'd be a real problem for me if the drugs
coming in here are traced back to you.

16:16.135 --> 16:17.521
And why would they?

16:17.521 --> 16:19.530
I'm just saying.

16:20.337 --> 16:21.844
Mr. Jackson!

16:21.844 --> 16:22.828
You're back!

16:22.828 --> 16:24.837
Smith, you're wanted.

16:27.789 --> 16:29.137
Thanks.

16:32.189 --> 16:33.436
Hey, Mr. Jackson.

16:42.636 --> 16:45.110
So, how you been, Mr. Jackson?

16:47.341 --> 16:49.992
Didn't think they'd ever let you
escort me anywhere ever again.

16:57.566 --> 16:58.231
Come in.

16:58.231 --> 16:59.575
I didn't ask to see a psych.

16:59.575 --> 17:00.318
Well you should.

17:00.318 --> 17:03.193
You bloody need it.

17:06.186 --> 17:08.978
I'm Bridget Westfall,
forensic psychologist.

17:08.978 --> 17:10.125
Yeah, I know who you are.

17:10.125 --> 17:13.420
I asked to see you in the
wake of today's sentencing.

17:13.420 --> 17:15.430
How are you feeling?

17:15.430 --> 17:17.439
How do you think I'm feeling?

17:17.439 --> 17:19.146
Well, I'd like to hear that from you.

17:19.146 --> 17:21.156
Take a seat.

17:21.556 --> 17:23.667
You can say whatever you like.

17:23.667 --> 17:26.239
Nothing goes out of this room.

17:31.138 --> 17:35.079
I know you're probably
still processing everything.

17:39.520 --> 17:41.967
For the last four months, this...

17:41.967 --> 17:44.262
Prison hasn't had TV, radio...

17:44.262 --> 17:46.593
They're bringing the cheapest
food into the kitchen.

17:46.593 --> 17:49.202
And their education
unit time's been halved.

17:49.202 --> 17:50.409
The Governor... she's doing this.

17:50.409 --> 17:52.540
She's punishing everyone in
here because of what I did,

17:52.540 --> 17:53.983
and it's time she stopped it.

17:53.983 --> 17:57.101
You know, the Governor's
under her own pressures.

17:57.101 --> 17:59.934
What pressures? What pressures?

18:01.759 --> 18:04.113
I'm not here to talk about the Governor.

18:03.171 --> 18:04.857
Is that why these measures
are still in place?

18:04.857 --> 18:06.791
Because she needs to be seen to
be doing something by the board?

18:06.791 --> 18:08.802
Is that it? Is it?

18:09.141 --> 18:10.814
We're here to talk about you.

18:12.642 --> 18:14.494
Is this session compulsory?

18:15.299 --> 18:16.547
No, it's not.

18:17.854 --> 18:18.976
Don't get me wrong.

18:18.976 --> 18:21.673
I'm really glad you're here. I am.

18:21.673 --> 18:24.069
There's plenty of women out
there that need your help.

18:24.069 --> 18:25.011
I'm just not one of them.

18:25.011 --> 18:28.413
That might be true, but you've
been through a hell of a lot lately.

18:28.413 --> 18:30.123
You may need some coping strategies,

18:30.123 --> 18:31.652
and it's my job to help you with that.

18:31.652 --> 18:33.663
It was good to meet you, Ms Westfall.

18:35.792 --> 18:37.765
No way! This is bullshit!

18:39.350 --> 18:41.624
Oh, shut it, Jenkins!

18:41.624 --> 18:43.177
She's gonna take away my smokes.

18:43.177 --> 18:44.785
- Hey what's going on?
- Stay out of it, Smith.

18:44.785 --> 18:47.658
You've got half an hour to smoke your last
cigarettes, then you hand in what's left.

18:47.658 --> 18:48.790
Have I missed something?

18:48.790 --> 18:50.153
They've banned smoking.

18:50.153 --> 18:52.007
I've gotta go to work soon, don't I?

18:52.007 --> 18:53.353
Then you've got five minutes.

18:53.353 --> 18:55.365
You can thank this one for that.

19:00.374 --> 19:04.357
Attention compound. Work detail's
to commence in five minutes.

19:04.357 --> 19:05.972
You sure about this?

19:05.983 --> 19:07.453
Not really.

19:07.453 --> 19:08.802
You know what Ferguson said to you...

19:08.802 --> 19:12.363
- You need to be careful.
- Yeah, too late to worry about being careful.

19:12.363 --> 19:14.857
- You all good?
- Yeah, all loaded up.

19:14.857 --> 19:17.914
Work detail's starting.
Get back to your jobs.

19:17.914 --> 19:20.469
All right, ladies. Light up.

19:33.099 --> 19:34.568
I said...

19:34.568 --> 19:36.057
Get back to work.

19:36.057 --> 19:38.310
Oh, sorry Ms. Bennett, but
we've been ordered to...

19:38.310 --> 19:40.157
to hand in all our smokes.

19:40.157 --> 19:41.608
You don't smoke, Smith.

19:41.991 --> 19:45.109
I'm a social smoker.

19:46.758 --> 19:48.870
See, if you spring this
on us without any warning,

19:48.870 --> 19:52.088
then work stops until the girls
have finished all their smokes.

19:52.088 --> 19:53.957
Return to work, now.

19:53.957 --> 19:55.367
You've been warned, Smith.

19:55.367 --> 19:58.501
I've just been given life
without parole, Governor.

19:58.966 --> 20:02.224
What more can you do to me?

20:06.972 --> 20:11.901
Whoa!

20:18.277 --> 20:20.850
Did you see the look on Ferguson's face?

20:20.850 --> 20:23.586
Yeah, like she was
gonna spit up a fur ball.

20:32.337 --> 20:33.362
Liz.

20:36.999 --> 20:38.592
Keep moving.

20:38.592 --> 20:40.481
Hey, what's going on?

20:40.481 --> 20:42.193
They're putting me back into general.

20:42.193 --> 20:43.701
You can't do that.

20:43.701 --> 20:44.987
Out of the way, Smith.

20:44.987 --> 20:46.195
No, you know what they'll do to her.

20:46.195 --> 20:47.578
I told you.

20:47.578 --> 20:48.845
- Out of the way.
- No, no...

20:48.845 --> 20:50.942
They'll tear her apart. You
know you that can't do this.

20:50.942 --> 20:52.712
- Insubordination. Slot her.
- What?

20:52.712 --> 20:55.668
You can't. No you can't do that!

20:56.172 --> 20:58.022
Hey Ferguson!

20:58.022 --> 20:59.308
Ferguson!

20:59.308 --> 21:01.116
You freak!

21:01.116 --> 21:02.266
Maxine!

21:02.266 --> 21:05.343
Stay with her! Stay with her!

21:13.408 --> 21:15.301
What the fuck?

21:15.823 --> 21:17.292
Hey Lucy.

21:17.292 --> 21:18.779
You're in H Block, eh?

21:18.779 --> 21:20.349
That's your cell, there.

21:20.349 --> 21:22.400
You know where the duress
button is if you need it.

21:22.400 --> 21:23.745
Yeah, Miss Bennett.

21:24.573 --> 21:25.840
Conway.

21:25.840 --> 21:27.061
What are you doing here?

21:27.061 --> 21:28.194
I live here, Governor.

21:28.194 --> 21:30.582
I believe you're required in medical.

21:30.582 --> 21:32.593
- I've already...
- Drug test.

21:35.917 --> 21:37.844
That's alright, love, I'll be okay.

21:37.844 --> 21:39.855
Now, Conway.

21:41.065 --> 21:43.114
Bea said no one touches her.

22:56.896 --> 22:59.149
I'm sorry about the seven years.

23:00.070 --> 23:02.187
I had to do it.

23:05.263 --> 23:07.274
And I have to do this.

23:29.300 --> 23:30.628
Attention Compound,

23:30.628 --> 23:31.614
This is a code black.

23:31.614 --> 23:33.258
All prisoners return to their units.

23:33.258 --> 23:35.531
Medical assistance required in H 4.

23:35.531 --> 23:38.070
I repeat. This is a code black.

23:52.230 --> 23:55.548
Nice big step. That's it.

23:55.548 --> 23:57.898
Little bit bigger with this leg.

23:57.898 --> 23:59.909
Nice big step.

24:12.827 --> 24:14.799
So, how are you?

24:15.459 --> 24:17.131
Pretty good.

24:17.131 --> 24:19.143
Since last week.

24:20.872 --> 24:22.258
How are you?

24:22.602 --> 24:23.427
Good.

24:23.427 --> 24:25.738
Busy. You know how it is.

24:28.330 --> 24:31.231
That's an application for the
disability support pension.

24:31.231 --> 24:34.430
You're gonna need some kind of income
when you get discharged from here.

24:34.430 --> 24:36.800
Don't know...

24:36.800 --> 24:38.813
I'll help you fill it out.

24:40.118 --> 24:41.751
So?

24:41.751 --> 24:43.762
Your name?

24:43.762 --> 24:45.774
You might know that one.

24:49.353 --> 24:51.084
Address?

24:51.084 --> 24:53.095
I want to see Will.

24:53.454 --> 24:55.328
Could you tell him?

24:57.320 --> 24:58.966
You sure that's what you want?

25:05.986 --> 25:07.598
I'll talk to him.

25:07.977 --> 25:09.609
Thank you.

25:21.758 --> 25:23.528
How's Liz doing?

25:23.528 --> 25:25.133
How is she?

25:37.739 --> 25:39.472
What happened to Liz?

25:39.472 --> 25:41.225
She's in medical.

25:42.330 --> 25:44.025
But she'll survive.

25:45.757 --> 25:47.309
What sort of human being...

25:47.309 --> 25:50.204
puts another person at
risk just to prove a point?

25:50.893 --> 25:53.009
You don't run this prison, Smith.

25:53.836 --> 25:55.023
I do.

25:56.751 --> 25:58.287
Bon appÃ©tit.

26:33.418 --> 26:35.026
Done.

26:35.026 --> 26:37.040
Not quite.

26:38.473 --> 26:40.528
Where have you been?

26:40.528 --> 26:41.900
Looking for a clean pair of socks.

26:41.900 --> 26:43.451
Got blood on the other ones.

26:43.451 --> 26:45.144
- Hey.
- What?

26:45.144 --> 26:47.158
You shouldn't have done that to Liz.

26:47.158 --> 26:48.728
She's a lagger!

26:48.728 --> 26:51.710
It was against what Bea wanted.

26:51.710 --> 26:53.724
Do you know how she is?

26:54.405 --> 26:56.505
Who cares?

27:00.856 --> 27:02.085
Where you been, Smiles?

27:02.085 --> 27:04.661
- Governor must be starving by now.
- Miss Miles,

27:04.661 --> 27:06.676
I'll take that for you.

27:06.676 --> 27:08.186
Thank you.

27:08.186 --> 27:11.004
- Oh, sorry.
- It's all right.

27:13.542 --> 27:15.237
Tell the Governor, "enjoy."

27:17.754 --> 27:20.738
Too fucking easy.

27:35.524 --> 27:36.491
Girls.

27:36.834 --> 27:37.841
Girls.

27:37.841 --> 27:40.358
We need to muster up.

27:47.369 --> 27:49.036
Come on, get it out.

27:51.861 --> 27:53.453
- Hey what's going on?
- Don't ask questions...

27:53.453 --> 27:55.079
Just turn around and...

27:59.777 --> 28:02.255
Build it as high as we can.

28:04.871 --> 28:05.637
Oi!

28:06.969 --> 28:08.259
- Oi!
- Hey, boy!

28:12.648 --> 28:14.584
What's the story, Conway?

28:15.186 --> 28:16.938
There's no story, Mr. Bakula.

28:17.161 --> 28:18.391
Ok, back up over here.

28:18.391 --> 28:21.005
Oh, there's no need, Mr. Bakula, really.

28:21.005 --> 28:23.020
All right, everyone step back!

28:24.393 --> 28:26.126
Step back now!

28:26.126 --> 28:28.403
Maybe you'd like to back off.

28:28.946 --> 28:31.162
I said back right off!

28:31.162 --> 28:33.178
I said back off!

28:34.284 --> 28:35.630
Billie!

28:36.783 --> 28:38.128
- The gate...
- Yeah.

28:38.128 --> 28:40.142
- On your way.
- Bye!

28:40.142 --> 28:43.087
On your way! I really didn't
want to raise my voice.

28:58.176 --> 29:00.411
Yeah, it's not too bad.

29:05.100 --> 29:07.140
Oh, shit!

29:07.140 --> 29:09.417
- Liz! Liz!
- Oh, Dor!

29:11.609 --> 29:12.519
The women have lost it.

29:12.519 --> 29:14.670
- You need to lock the door, okay?
- Jesus!

29:14.670 --> 29:16.926
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

29:16.926 --> 29:18.863
- What's going on?
- Don't worry, okay?

29:18.863 --> 29:19.928
You'll be fine.

29:19.928 --> 29:21.943
Dor, what's going on?

29:21.943 --> 29:23.714
Are they after Liz?

29:23.714 --> 29:25.729
What's going on, Dor?

29:29.216 --> 29:31.938
I was ambushed, Mr. Channing.

29:31.938 --> 29:33.388
I did the best I could.

29:33.388 --> 29:35.403
Well, it wasn't enough. Hmm?

29:40.217 --> 29:42.067
have you seen the
chairman since the meeting?

29:42.067 --> 29:43.179
Mmm-hmm.

29:43.179 --> 29:44.689
He hasn't changed his mind

29:44.689 --> 29:46.421
Well, then I would try harder.

29:47.228 --> 29:49.060
Because I'm beginning to
wonder whether it's even worth

29:49.060 --> 29:50.813
having an ally on the board if he...

29:50.813 --> 29:53.068
fails to deliver any benefits.

29:54.134 --> 29:56.208
They think you might
have become a liability.

29:56.208 --> 29:57.398
I won't concede.

29:57.398 --> 29:58.482
Tell them that.

29:58.482 --> 29:59.655
It's not looking good.

29:59.655 --> 30:02.192
Well, then it's not looking
so good for you, either.

30:02.192 --> 30:03.500
If they move on me,

30:03.500 --> 30:06.037
I'd be more than happy to fill them
in on that little staffing issue...

30:06.037 --> 30:08.052
at your brothels.

30:09.104 --> 30:10.675
I'm sure it won't come to that.

30:19.458 --> 30:20.303
Wait here.

30:20.303 --> 30:22.479
- Give me a minute with them.
- Ah, stay close!

30:22.479 --> 30:24.493
- Hi Mr. Jackson.
- Hey.

30:24.493 --> 30:26.947
- Long time, no see!
- Okay, Maxine.

30:26.947 --> 30:27.999
Wanna tell me what's going on?

30:27.999 --> 30:30.034
Girls just felt like a
bit of a barbie, didn't we?

30:30.034 --> 30:32.049
- Beautiful day!
- Come on, Max.

30:32.167 --> 30:33.232
What's the problem?

30:33.232 --> 30:35.168
There's no problem, Mr. Jackson.

30:35.168 --> 30:37.445
- Well, there's gotta be something...
- You come any closer,

30:37.445 --> 30:38.837
- All right.
- and someone's gonna get hurt.

30:38.877 --> 30:39.643
- Okay.
- Hmm?

30:39.643 --> 30:40.185
Yep.

30:40.185 --> 30:41.290
- I mean it!
- All right.

30:41.290 --> 30:42.704
You tell them to get out of here!

30:42.704 --> 30:45.162
- Now! Now!
- Back off! Back off now!

30:45.162 --> 30:46.431
Take it easy, Max.

30:46.431 --> 30:47.759
You take it easy!

30:47.759 --> 30:49.150
- Okay, okay.
- Fuck off!

30:49.150 --> 30:51.164
All of you!

30:52.573 --> 30:53.905
That's right.

31:00.689 --> 31:02.769
Zero four calling zero two.

31:03.554 --> 31:04.939
This is the Governor.

31:04.939 --> 31:07.019
I'm in the exercise yard, Governor.

31:07.019 --> 31:09.733
We have a situation.

31:25.713 --> 31:29.616
All available officers are to report
to the exercise yard immediately.

31:29.616 --> 31:31.011
I repeat...

31:31.011 --> 31:35.724
all available officers are to report
to the exercise yard immediately.

31:40.658 --> 31:44.502
All prisoners return to their units.

31:47.523 --> 31:49.442
Zero four, this is the Governor.

31:49.442 --> 31:51.292
Zero two, receiving.

31:51.292 --> 31:52.763
Shut that alarm off.

31:52.763 --> 31:54.117
Report, please.

31:54.117 --> 31:56.131
Fire is restricted to
the middle of the yard.

31:56.550 --> 31:58.564
Uh, some prisoners are armed.

31:58.564 --> 31:59.878
No injuries at this stage.

31:59.878 --> 32:00.821
We've retreated.

32:00.821 --> 32:02.535
So as not to escalate the situation.

32:02.535 --> 32:05.354
It appears containable
at this stage, Governor.

32:05.354 --> 32:06.504
What do they want?

32:06.504 --> 32:08.375
They won't say, Governor.

32:12.810 --> 32:14.941
Are you able to identify who's involved?

32:14.941 --> 32:17.682
It appears to be H block, Governor.

32:17.682 --> 32:20.364
Maxine Conway is the ring leader.

32:20.364 --> 32:22.378
Zero three, this is the Governor.

32:22.378 --> 32:23.948
Zero three, receiving.

32:23.948 --> 32:25.602
What's the status of the lock down?

32:25.602 --> 32:27.616
All units are secure except H block.

32:27.616 --> 32:29.826
- Who's left in H block?
- No one.

32:29.826 --> 32:31.121
You need to call back up.

32:31.121 --> 32:33.294
If these women want to burn
all their personal possessions

32:33.294 --> 32:33.836
Then let them.

32:33.836 --> 32:35.047
- Joan.
- There is no violence,

32:35.047 --> 32:35.734
no one is injured.

32:35.734 --> 32:37.303
- I'm not calling in SESG.
- You'll have to.

32:37.303 --> 32:39.319
The board will find out anyway.

32:39.319 --> 32:41.333
Then I will know who told them.

32:53.058 --> 32:54.949
What's going on?

32:55.230 --> 32:56.963
Get back to your units.

32:59.343 --> 33:02.019
Get back to your units!

33:13.059 --> 33:14.431
Help!

33:18.599 --> 33:20.633
Help!

33:22.105 --> 33:25.551
No!

33:39.914 --> 33:41.581
Someone's out there.

33:46.440 --> 33:48.758
This is a really stupid...

33:48.758 --> 33:50.646
They've got a guard. I
think it's Miss Bennett.

33:50.646 --> 33:52.100
Is she all right?

33:52.100 --> 33:53.426
The prison's in lock down, the...

33:53.426 --> 33:55.905
Governor will call in SESG!

33:55.905 --> 33:58.666
What the hell are they up to?

33:59.231 --> 34:00.680
Get down.

34:03.563 --> 34:05.899
What are you trying to achieve, anyway?

34:05.899 --> 34:07.915
Whatever you're trying to
do, it's gonna end badly.

34:07.915 --> 34:09.745
If you let me go now, I will...

34:09.745 --> 34:11.458
Shut up!

34:13.210 --> 34:14.965
Where are we going?

34:21.915 --> 34:23.181
Oi!

34:23.726 --> 34:24.815
Where do you think you're going?

34:24.815 --> 34:26.367
We've got a food delivery to bring in.

34:26.367 --> 34:28.018
It'll have to wait. We're in lock down.

34:28.018 --> 34:29.529
Come on, Smiles.

34:29.529 --> 34:31.543
Back off, Doyle. I'm not in the mood.

34:31.543 --> 34:32.389
Well, look...

34:32.389 --> 34:33.599
It's sitting there in the sally port.

34:33.599 --> 34:35.047
- Mates gonna go...
- Yeah? I don't care.

34:35.047 --> 34:37.909
Place is in lock down.
No one goes anywhere.

34:39.016 --> 34:40.326
There's money in it for you.

34:40.326 --> 34:41.877
I still don't care.

34:41.877 --> 34:43.933
If you're so worried about
this deliver of yours,

34:43.933 --> 34:47.175
Maybe you should've told your mates not
to start burning their gear in the yard.

34:47.175 --> 34:48.585
Report to the surveillance room, over.

34:48.585 --> 34:50.016
Roger that.

34:51.284 --> 34:53.299
Keep an eye on this one, will you?

34:55.978 --> 34:57.529
What are you gonna do?

34:59.221 --> 35:01.981
- Fuck!
- I know, all right? Shut up.

35:01.981 --> 35:02.887
What happened?

35:02.887 --> 35:05.828
Queen Bea, that's what fucking happened.

35:10.321 --> 35:11.952
Still no demands?

35:11.952 --> 35:13.967
No Governor.

35:15.378 --> 35:17.049
Maintain your presence there.

35:17.049 --> 35:19.245
They'll get bored eventually.
When they do, you can move in.

35:19.245 --> 35:21.117
- Copy that.
- You're taking a hell of a risk.

35:21.117 --> 35:22.467
No, I know it's contained,

35:22.467 --> 35:25.570
but if someone gets injured and
you haven't called for backup...

35:25.872 --> 35:27.221
Kitchen's secure, Governor.

35:27.221 --> 35:29.095
But there are still prisoners
missing from H block.

35:29.095 --> 35:31.089
Joan, listen, you need to call for back up.

35:31.089 --> 35:34.131
- I will talk to the board...
- What's happened to this feed?

35:36.205 --> 35:39.167
Where is this? They're
spraying the cameras.

35:41.062 --> 35:42.935
H block corridor...

35:43.175 --> 35:46.278
Lower level stairway,
admissions corridor...

35:47.004 --> 35:49.986
This fire is a diversion.
They're after something else.

35:50.307 --> 35:51.716
Ferguson.

35:53.227 --> 35:56.190
Ferguson you fucking freak, answer me.

35:59.997 --> 36:01.549
This is the Governor.

36:01.549 --> 36:04.569
... the slot. Have a look.

36:04.731 --> 36:06.746
Bring that up on there.

36:14.037 --> 36:14.943
What do you want?

36:14.943 --> 36:16.434
We've got Vinegar Tits.

36:16.434 --> 36:19.638
Open the door or we start fucking with her.

36:20.202 --> 36:21.653
Zoom it up.

36:29.588 --> 36:31.422
To whom am I speaking?

36:31.422 --> 36:34.000
Don't try that shit with me.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.014
The management unit is in lock down.

36:36.014 --> 36:38.029
I'm not able to open that door.

36:38.473 --> 36:40.225
You've got a phone, use it.

36:40.225 --> 36:42.662
Tell the screws in there
to open the fucking door,

36:42.662 --> 36:44.677
then fuck off out of there now.

36:44.677 --> 36:45.825
All right.

36:46.065 --> 36:48.927
I will need some time to
speak with the officers inside.

36:48.927 --> 36:50.942
You got two minutes.

36:50.942 --> 36:51.970
Miss Miles?

36:51.970 --> 36:53.440
Round up all available officers.

36:53.440 --> 36:54.871
Send a group to the admissions corridor.

36:54.871 --> 36:56.219
Another one to the kitchen stairs.

36:56.219 --> 36:57.870
You can take the prisoners
from two directions.

36:57.870 --> 36:59.140
And be ruthless!

36:59.140 --> 37:00.369
No one gets away.

37:00.369 --> 37:01.619
Yes, Governor.

37:23.394 --> 37:25.731
You know how you can
put a stop to this now.

37:27.625 --> 37:29.317
You know you don't have a chance.

37:29.317 --> 37:32.922
The SE is still...

37:39.448 --> 37:41.604
Now what are you gonna tell the board?

37:42.128 --> 37:46.036
The my officers had the situation
under control the entire time.

37:46.036 --> 37:48.050
Ferguson.

37:48.050 --> 37:50.065
The situation is about to be resolved.

37:50.065 --> 37:52.080
A little more patience, please.

37:52.080 --> 37:53.731
Oh, really?

37:53.731 --> 37:55.201
That is correct.

37:55.201 --> 37:58.365
They've disabled the doors.
The officers can't get to them.

37:58.365 --> 38:00.781
Have a look at the monitor.

38:02.898 --> 38:04.751
Oh, Jesus Christ!

38:04.751 --> 38:06.081
Time's up, freak.

38:06.081 --> 38:09.201
Open the door, or Vinegar Tits gets it.

38:16.837 --> 38:18.207
No.

38:18.771 --> 38:20.442
- Last chance...
- No?

38:20.442 --> 38:24.471
Open the fucking door,
or we will inject her.

38:24.471 --> 38:27.614
- What the hell are you doing?
- I will not give in to these demands.

38:27.614 --> 38:29.024
- You listen to me,
- For God's sake.

38:29.024 --> 38:31.563
You will return to your unit...

38:31.964 --> 38:35.026
This is Derek Channing, general
manager of this facility.

38:35.026 --> 38:36.980
Officers in the isolation unit...

38:36.980 --> 38:38.471
Go to emergency channel.

38:38.471 --> 38:39.741
Yes, sir.

38:39.741 --> 38:40.870
Open the gates,

38:40.870 --> 38:42.360
leave your keys,

38:42.360 --> 38:43.044
and go.

38:43.044 --> 38:44.112
Do not make any move

38:44.112 --> 38:45.562
That puts Miss Bennet's life at risk.

38:45.562 --> 38:46.549
Am I clear?

38:46.549 --> 38:47.799
Yes, sir.

39:22.366 --> 39:23.896
Joan.

39:37.239 --> 39:38.259
Bea!

39:38.599 --> 39:39.378
Here.

39:39.378 --> 39:40.560
Bea!

39:40.560 --> 39:42.560
I'm here!

39:44.143 --> 39:45.123
- Bea.
- Hi.

39:45.303 --> 39:47.443
We've got ourselves a friend.

39:47.904 --> 39:50.186
Well, lock her in here.

39:57.489 --> 39:58.950
Come on.

40:17.240 --> 40:19.281
I'm overruling you.

40:19.281 --> 40:21.282
Make that call.

40:21.622 --> 40:24.484
I think you're forgetting
something, Mr. Channing.

40:25.805 --> 40:28.306
I won't be calling the SESG.

40:29.606 --> 40:31.208
And neither will you.

40:31.907 --> 40:36.069
Zero two, this is zero four.

40:36.069 --> 40:37.731
This is the Governor.

40:37.731 --> 40:40.431
The women want to speak to you.

40:40.431 --> 40:41.793
What do they want?

40:41.793 --> 40:44.174
They want to speak to you.

41:58.255 --> 42:00.256
- Mr. Jackson.
- Governor.

42:27.689 --> 42:33.835
Bea! Bea! Bea!

42:42.859 --> 42:44.259
Well?

42:45.941 --> 42:48.541
You haven't called in the squad.

42:49.822 --> 42:51.463
You don't know I haven't.

42:53.684 --> 42:57.367
And let the world know you've
lost control of this place?

42:57.827 --> 42:59.848
It was never gonna happen.

43:00.528 --> 43:02.988
I can put a stop to this now.

43:02.988 --> 43:04.710
Tell the women to back off,

43:04.710 --> 43:07.391
put down their weapons, send
them back to their units.

43:07.391 --> 43:09.653
Or, we can just stay here, hang out,

43:09.653 --> 43:11.574
until you're forced to call the squad.

43:11.574 --> 43:13.575
It's up to you.

43:18.458 --> 43:19.879
What do you want?

43:20.960 --> 43:24.080
No repercussions for
anyone involved here today.

43:25.302 --> 43:28.723
And anything that affects
the women in the future,

43:29.023 --> 43:30.845
you run it by me first.

43:33.366 --> 43:34.807
You don't run this prison.

43:36.127 --> 43:37.288
I do.
