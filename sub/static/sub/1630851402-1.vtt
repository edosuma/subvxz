30:26.040 --> 30:27.560
About three minutes away.

30:27.560 --> 30:30.520
Scottsville 54,
head to the south end of Acacia...

30:30.520 --> 30:34.120
It's really buzzing.
It must be big.

30:34.120 --> 30:37.560
They would have called out
all the brigades in the region.

30:37.560 --> 30:40.640
They'll want to stop it
before it gets anywhere near houses.

30:41.760 --> 30:43.120
What's the plan?

30:43.120 --> 30:44.800
We'll probably do a back burn,

30:44.800 --> 30:47.920
get rid of some of the fuel load
in the bush behind the estate.

30:47.920 --> 30:49.880
Bligh 42, Firecom.

30:49.880 --> 30:52.240

Go ahead, Firecom.

30:52.240 --> 30:56.360

of visible smoke.

30:56.360 --> 30:58.440
Are you available to respond? Over.

30:58.440 --> 31:02.600
Firecom, we're currently
on our way to Acacia.

31:02.600 --> 31:05.680
Bligh 42, reroute from Acacia...

31:05.680 --> 31:07.000
I'm sorry.

31:09.280 --> 31:12.680
About before. On the fireground.
I overreacted...

31:12.680 --> 31:14.200
No, you're alright.

31:18.040 --> 31:19.360
Actually...

31:21.560 --> 31:22.920
..I'm sorry too.

31:25.160 --> 31:26.480
What for?

31:29.600 --> 31:32.640
Ohhh!

31:33.800 --> 31:35.720
Oh, my God!
Oh!

31:35.720 --> 31:37.920
It's just nerves.
That's...that's disgusting!

31:37.920 --> 31:40.480
It's just nerves.
Oh, yours are just as bad!

31:40.480 --> 31:41.920
Oh! Not like that.

31:41.920 --> 31:44.800
You've got some kind
of digestive problem.

31:44.800 --> 31:46.520
Well, it's all the fruit and veg
I've been eating.

31:46.520 --> 31:49.560
I've NEVER seen you
eat a piece of fruit.

31:49.560 --> 31:52.360
OK, it's the chips and the pies
and the baked beans.

31:52.360 --> 31:54.760
Yeah, more like it.
You know I like my baked beans.

31:54.760 --> 31:58.480
Yeah, I know, I know. (LAUGHS)

The air brakes have gone.

34:24.520 --> 34:27.520
Uh, the wheels are locked. We're
going into personal protection.

34:27.520 --> 34:31.760

Going into personal protection.

34:33.320 --> 34:35.080
We've got to go back there.

35:58.840 --> 36:00.760
We wouldn't last
five seconds out there!

36:00.760 --> 36:04.320
The best chance is
they stay inside and get low.

36:04.320 --> 36:06.840

44:34.160 --> 44:35.360
Mott.
Mott.

44:35.360 --> 44:39.000
Mott.
Hey, you alright?

44:39.000 --> 44:41.200
This face.

44:41.200 --> 44:42.840
(SOBS)

44:42.840 --> 44:46.000
Ohh.
Oh, this beautiful face.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.040
We never thought we'd see you again.

44:49.600 --> 44:52.840
He scared us, hey?

44:52.840 --> 44:55.560
I'm alright. I'm here. I'm here.

44:59.160 --> 45:00.480
WOMAN: Tash!

45:03.040 --> 45:04.720
(SOBS)

45:20.400 --> 45:24.040
Dad, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean what I said.

45:24.040 --> 45:25.760
That's OK.

45:28.040 --> 45:29.640
(SOBS)

45:41.360 --> 45:43.040
Here...

46:01.880 --> 46:04.200
(ON RADIO) Residents are
in the process of evacuating

46:04.200 --> 46:05.400
from the new housing estate

46:05.400 --> 46:08.880
as the fire continues to burn
out of control towards their homes.

46:08.880 --> 46:10.720
Firefighters are working
to contain the blaze

46:10.720 --> 46:13.520
which earlier threatened the lives
of two young volunteers

46:13.520 --> 46:16.480
when their fire truck...
(TURNS RADIO OFF)

46:26.160 --> 46:28.480
You going to the hospital?
Yeah.

46:33.760 --> 46:35.880
We were on the news.

46:35.880 --> 46:38.280
Always knew I'd be famous one day.

46:45.840 --> 46:47.320
How'd you like your first fire?

46:47.320 --> 46:49.520
Mmm...bit ordinary.

46:49.520 --> 46:51.560
Mmm. Yeah.
Yeah.

46:51.560 --> 46:54.040
(VEHICLE APPROACHES)

46:57.320 --> 46:59.200
(SIREN WAILS)

47:18.480 --> 47:20.160
Hope the second one's better.

47:22.040 --> 47:23.240
Hope so.

47:24.960 --> 47:27.840
(CAR HORN TOOTS)
ROSIE: Hey, hurry up!

47:29.480 --> 47:30.520
Sorry.

47:31.800 --> 47:33.640
It's OK.

48:06.640 --> 48:12.280
This township now begins the slow
process of healing and rebuilding.

48:12.280 --> 48:13.840
We're still alive.

48:13.840 --> 48:16.520
It's just stuff.
It's not just stuff, Duncan.

48:16.520 --> 48:19.120
People are saying this fire
was deliberately lit.

48:19.120 --> 48:20.800
Arson.

48:20.800 --> 48:22.760
Everything's so dry here,
it'd only take a match

48:22.760 --> 48:24.360
for the whole valley to go up.

48:24.360 --> 48:26.000
I don't want journalists
coming here.

48:26.000 --> 48:27.080
Alright.

48:27.080 --> 48:29.280
It's gonna be
a pretty intense fire season.

48:29.280 --> 48:31.160
We'll go wherever we're needed.

48:31.160 --> 48:34.280
Did you know Arch smoked?
Well, he's a 14-year-old boy.

48:35.600 --> 48:38.280
Do you think Arch started the fire?
Think about what you're saying.

48:38.280 --> 48:41.880
What'd you do? Were you out there
smoking on Saturday?
