WEBVTT

00:09.406 --> 00:10.739
Hey, buddy.

00:10.808 --> 00:12.941
Jack's busting out of his crib
and crawling everywhere!

00:13.010 --> 00:14.676
- What?!
- Yesterday, I found him in the dryer.

00:14.745 --> 00:16.411
Hey, do they have
electric bars for cribs

00:16.480 --> 00:17.673
that can, like, shock babies

00:17.697 --> 00:19.481
- but not, like, hurt them?
- Sorry, Miggy.

00:19.516 --> 00:22.484
Babies learn to walk, and then
they keep doing it. Forever.

00:22.553 --> 00:23.618
I feel so old.

00:23.687 --> 00:25.854
Just a year ago,
it was the Summer of Miggy.

00:25.879 --> 00:26.822
Ca-ca-caw.

00:26.890 --> 00:27.956
Man, what a time that was...

00:28.025 --> 00:29.724
The Los Angeles Dodgers. Okay.

00:29.827 --> 00:31.326
I'm just throwing out a new topic here.

00:31.351 --> 00:32.371
Let's run with that.

00:32.396 --> 00:34.429
I threw a party every night, bro.

00:34.531 --> 00:35.997
Of course, that was
when I still had access

00:36.066 --> 00:37.499
to my mom's Costco card.

00:37.568 --> 00:39.167
Ugh. I remember when Rory was little.

00:39.236 --> 00:40.836
I was so desperate for a night out.

00:40.904 --> 00:42.871
And then I finally get one, and
all I'd think about was Rory...

00:42.973 --> 00:45.907
was he sleeping or eating
or making that little face?

00:45.976 --> 00:47.742
It was a half-smile,
which could be gas or joy.

00:47.811 --> 00:49.177
You know what?

00:49.246 --> 00:50.378
You just need a night out.

00:50.481 --> 00:52.247
Re-create the Summer of Miggy,
ca-ca-caw.

00:52.316 --> 00:54.683
Yes! Throw a party tonight.

00:54.751 --> 00:56.451
Will can watch Jack.
He's already got the big kids.

00:56.476 --> 00:57.552
Just slap a baby on that.

00:57.621 --> 00:59.554
Yo, good looks, Will. You the man.

00:59.623 --> 01:01.356
Cool. Wait, what just happened?

01:01.458 --> 01:03.425
Okay, just one final favor.

01:03.527 --> 01:05.060
- Can none of you come?
- Done.

01:05.129 --> 01:06.695
Sorry. It's just, you know,
we didn't have

01:06.763 --> 01:09.598
a lot of old parents during
the Summer of Miggy, ca-ca-caw.

01:09.666 --> 01:10.699
Not to worry.

01:10.767 --> 01:12.100
Douglas roped me into joining him

01:12.169 --> 01:13.735
at some fundraiser tonight.
What's it for, again?

01:13.804 --> 01:14.736
It's irrelevant.

01:14.805 --> 01:16.471
What I'm going for is the potatoes.

01:16.540 --> 01:18.773
The chef at this thing,
he serves them up

01:18.842 --> 01:21.243
in a dream state
between whipped and mashed.

01:21.345 --> 01:22.344
Mmm.

01:22.446 --> 01:23.912
You're too into potatoes, man!

01:24.014 --> 01:24.980
That's sad.

01:25.082 --> 01:26.548
Being an adult is sad.

01:26.650 --> 01:28.216
Right, Jack?

01:28.318 --> 01:30.218
There was a baby in there
when you left the house, right?

01:30.320 --> 01:31.319
Say wha...

01:31.421 --> 01:32.654
Oh, he got my keys!

01:32.723 --> 01:34.222
Oh! Jack! No, no, no!

01:34.324 --> 01:36.725
I'll wait here in case he comes back.

01:36.827 --> 01:39.728

01:46.069 --> 01:47.602
Hi!

01:47.704 --> 01:49.303
Okay, no, you're not dropping
those people off with me.

01:49.389 --> 01:50.615
- Watch your fingers!
- Hold on!

01:50.678 --> 01:51.840
Something amazing has happened.

01:51.942 --> 01:53.642
KZOP's own Guy McCormick

01:53.744 --> 01:56.144
has dislocated his shoulder
in an ATV accident!

01:56.246 --> 01:58.580
Ooh! Is there a video?

01:58.682 --> 02:00.549
Angie, they need me to cover
the 10:00 P.M. forecast tonight!

02:00.651 --> 02:01.716
This is my big shot.

02:01.818 --> 02:02.918
I think it's 'cause
I grew out the beard,

02:03.020 --> 02:04.186
per Tracy's request.

02:04.288 --> 02:06.121
Something about me looking
like a weather wizard.

02:06.146 --> 02:07.299
Okay, you're hitting me
with a lot of details,

02:07.331 --> 02:08.430
and I'm starting to lose interest.

02:08.525 --> 02:10.025
- What's the point?
- You gotta watch the kids.

02:10.127 --> 02:11.593
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

02:11.695 --> 02:13.895
No! No! No! No! You guys! Don't... No!

02:15.065 --> 02:16.932
I can't. All right?

02:17.034 --> 02:18.400
Owen is on his way over.

02:18.502 --> 02:19.834
Okay, that's great. You'll have help.

02:19.937 --> 02:21.503
No, no, no. Graham hasn't met him yet.

02:21.605 --> 02:22.737
- They haven't met? No, I thought...
- No, no, no.

02:22.839 --> 02:25.373
He's met Santa-Owen,
but not my boyfriend Owen.

02:25.475 --> 02:28.009
My boyfriend Owen doesn't wear a
red suit, doesn't have a beard,

02:28.111 --> 02:29.578
and is, frankly, a little less hot.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.813
Look, I get it. But I can't
show up to work with six kids.

02:31.915 --> 02:33.782
Tracy Freeze is already
riding me really hard

02:33.884 --> 02:35.984
because of all
my pronunciation slip-ups...

02:36.086 --> 02:37.118
like when I botched "thunder."

02:37.221 --> 02:39.487
It is really weird
how you call it "thundle."

02:39.590 --> 02:40.822
Please just do me this favor.

02:40.924 --> 02:42.123
All right, dude.

02:42.226 --> 02:43.625
I know that this is a big deal for you,

02:43.727 --> 02:46.094
so... I'll text Owen and cancel.

02:46.196 --> 02:47.562
But you owe me, okay?

02:47.664 --> 02:50.031
And stop trying to pawn off
your Borders gift cards, okay?

02:50.133 --> 02:51.766
Everybody knows they're closed!

02:51.868 --> 02:53.101
You are a lifesaver.

02:53.203 --> 02:54.703
Also...

02:54.805 --> 02:56.204
you got to watch baby Jack.

02:56.306 --> 02:58.607
Apparently, he cannot be contained.
Good luck.

03:01.211 --> 03:02.711
Who wants screen time?

03:02.813 --> 03:04.646
Yay!

03:07.340 --> 03:08.193
Ah.

03:08.218 --> 03:09.484
How do I look?

03:09.586 --> 03:11.653
Like 500 bucks.

03:11.755 --> 03:13.288
That's how much
your plate costs tonight.

03:13.390 --> 03:14.522
Let's go.

03:17.394 --> 03:19.761
Well, sounds like
Miggy's party is starting up.

03:19.830 --> 03:21.930
Either that or he's trying to
cover up the sound of a murder.

03:21.999 --> 03:23.031
Either way, let's go.

03:23.100 --> 03:24.666
Oh! Remember when we were his age?

03:24.735 --> 03:27.435
- I don't.
- All the fun house parties.

03:27.504 --> 03:30.238
It was like, Jodeci,
"Fresh Prince," "Clueless"

03:30.307 --> 03:31.840
all rolled into one.

03:31.908 --> 03:34.075
In retrospect, I had
a serious drinking problem.

03:34.144 --> 03:36.745
Hmm. You know, I really
never understood parties.

03:36.813 --> 03:39.047
I have a house.
Why am I going to your house?

03:39.116 --> 03:40.348
Because it's fun to hang out

03:40.417 --> 03:42.235
with other people
at good old-fashioned parties.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.251
You never tried fun?

03:43.320 --> 03:46.121
Well, there's a game on my phone
where you try to make squares.

03:47.624 --> 03:50.458
Okay, I'm Miggy's friend,
but I'm also his landlord.

03:50.494 --> 03:52.427
Maybe we stop by on our way out?
Just pop in quick.

03:52.452 --> 03:53.328
Okay.

03:53.397 --> 03:54.629
- But just for 10 minutes...
- Yes.

03:54.698 --> 03:56.331
...but expect me to be terse
with the other party-goers.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.399
Oh, I expect it.

04:01.004 --> 04:03.104
Hey, I don't see him. Do you?

04:03.173 --> 04:04.339
No! And I'm miserable!

04:04.408 --> 04:06.408
I've already been offered
four vape pens.

04:07.611 --> 04:08.977
- A-All right, see? There you go.
- Oh.

04:09.046 --> 04:10.245
It's just ice. It's not a body.

04:10.347 --> 04:11.379
- Let's go.
- Come on, come on.

04:11.448 --> 04:12.514
Hey, Miggy.

04:12.616 --> 04:13.915
- Hey!
- Hey.

04:14.017 --> 04:15.016
We just wanted to check on you,

04:15.118 --> 04:16.216
make sure the walls were still up.

04:16.286 --> 04:17.319
Don't worry. We'll get out of your hair.

04:17.387 --> 04:18.620
I know you don't want
old parents here...

04:18.689 --> 04:20.088
No, no, no! D-Don't go. Don't go.

04:20.190 --> 04:22.223
So, it turns out that old parents

04:22.292 --> 04:23.925
are the only people
that I actually understand.

04:24.027 --> 04:25.160
Well, what's going on?

04:25.228 --> 04:26.461
I'm having a hard time connecting with

04:26.563 --> 04:28.229
my "Summer of Miggy" persona.

04:28.298 --> 04:30.432
All right, so, this is Jack eating dirt,

04:30.500 --> 04:32.701
and this is Jack making a cute noise.

04:32.769 --> 04:35.203
I-It's just better
when you can hear the noise.

04:37.207 --> 04:38.173
Hey!

04:38.241 --> 04:40.508
You guys seen "Paddington 2"?

04:40.577 --> 04:42.444
No?

04:42.546 --> 04:43.712
And to make matters worse,

04:43.814 --> 04:45.246
Kickeeboy's sister just texted me.

04:45.315 --> 04:46.147
Kiwi... who?

04:46.249 --> 04:47.215
Kickeeboy's sister.

04:47.284 --> 04:48.750
Yeah, we call her KBS.

04:48.819 --> 04:50.552
Man, we vibed hard a few years back.

04:50.620 --> 04:52.020
She texted saying that she's coming over

04:52.122 --> 04:53.488
and she's excited to see me.

04:53.590 --> 04:55.423
Yeah, with, like, 15 eggplant emojis

04:55.492 --> 04:56.725
and a gif of Rihanna winking.

04:56.759 --> 04:57.736
The "Ellen" one?

04:57.761 --> 04:58.993
Eh, eh, eh! Eh, eh, eh!

04:59.062 --> 05:00.814
Okay, okay, all right.
Yeah, good luck with all that.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.797
Wait, no, no, no, no, no!
You can't leave. You can't leave.

05:02.866 --> 05:03.832
I need you guys to help me

05:03.900 --> 05:05.300
snap out of it before she gets here.

05:05.369 --> 05:07.035
- Please. Please.
- One second.

05:07.137 --> 05:10.004
Hey, c'mon! He's drowning here.

05:10.073 --> 05:12.140
You wanna know what's drowning?
The potatoes.

05:12.209 --> 05:13.675
In chives and sour cream.

05:13.744 --> 05:14.909
You and these damn potatoes.

05:14.978 --> 05:16.578
Look, just give me 10 minutes.

05:16.646 --> 05:17.712
Keep yourself busy.

05:17.781 --> 05:19.514
Look, there's a beer pong game.

05:19.583 --> 05:21.583
Go play, and we can talk about how
much you hated it in the car.

05:21.651 --> 05:25.653
Poppy, I refuse to insert myself
into some teenager's game.

05:25.722 --> 05:26.755
Okay, well, then I will.

05:26.823 --> 05:29.257
- Hey, everybody. This is Douglas.
- Poppy.

05:29.359 --> 05:30.692
Stop it. You're embarrassing me!

05:30.761 --> 05:32.227
He doesn't know anybody here,

05:32.295 --> 05:33.695
but he'd love to play with all of you.

05:33.764 --> 05:34.996
Yeah, never said that.

05:35.065 --> 05:36.531
See? That's what I did for Rory

05:36.600 --> 05:38.366
at birthday parties
that one month he was shy.

05:38.435 --> 05:39.968
Yeah? How'd that turn out?

05:40.036 --> 05:41.936
All right, Tall Guy! You're up.

05:42.005 --> 05:43.538
Fine. What's the buy-in?

05:43.607 --> 05:44.939
What's the what?

05:45.008 --> 05:46.508
Yeah, this isn't gonna work.
It's gonna have to move.

05:46.610 --> 05:47.909
Where have you been?

05:48.011 --> 05:49.043
I know. I know. I'm sorry.

05:49.146 --> 05:50.412
I had to take care
of a few things, but I'm...

05:50.480 --> 05:51.646
Forget it. Just get into
hair and makeup.

05:51.748 --> 05:53.448
And lose the kid.

05:55.085 --> 05:56.518
Newsflash... I'm at your work.

05:56.586 --> 05:57.819
Rory! What are you doing here?

05:57.888 --> 05:59.587
Okay, I stowed away in your backseat,

05:59.689 --> 06:01.489
right next to
the bulk-sized toilet paper.

06:01.558 --> 06:03.925
And yes, Will, I saw everything.

06:04.027 --> 06:06.561
Mommy made me mash my M&M'S-zah.

06:06.630 --> 06:09.497
Mommy made me mash my M&M'S-zah.

06:10.500 --> 06:11.800
Whoo!

06:11.902 --> 06:12.967

06:13.069 --> 06:14.169

And we will never talk about it again.

06:28.218 --> 06:29.250
This is your fault.

06:29.319 --> 06:31.252
You lent me
the essential Sorkin box set.

06:31.354 --> 06:34.923
And if "Sports Night" and one
blessed season of "Studio 60"

06:35.025 --> 06:36.224
has taught me anything,

06:36.293 --> 06:38.726
it's that TV stations
are hotbeds for scandal.

06:38.795 --> 06:40.328
Rory, we have been over this.

06:40.430 --> 06:42.297
KZOP is just a local news station

06:42.365 --> 06:44.632
and in no way resembles
anything from the Sorkin-verse.

06:44.734 --> 06:45.767
There is no story.

06:45.836 --> 06:47.001
Okay, Will. Challenge accepted.

06:47.103 --> 06:48.136
That wasn't a challenge!

06:48.205 --> 06:50.071
I'm doing this for you.
You're gonna thank me.

06:50.140 --> 06:51.539
You know what they say... a newscaster

06:51.608 --> 06:53.308
is only as vibrant as his workplace.

06:53.410 --> 06:54.642
Nobody says that.

06:54.744 --> 06:56.678
Why are you not in hair and makeup?

06:56.746 --> 06:58.446
You know what? Go home.

06:58.515 --> 07:00.515
I-I will just run
yesterday's forecast instead.

07:00.617 --> 07:01.583
It's Los Angeles. No one'll notice.

07:01.685 --> 07:03.718
No, Tracy... Tracy, please, please.

07:03.820 --> 07:04.686
I can do this.

07:04.788 --> 07:06.287
Mm. Fine.

07:06.389 --> 07:07.522
Now, if you'll excuse me,

07:07.624 --> 07:08.990
I have to go pick out tonight's murders.

07:10.114 --> 07:11.960
Well, that took no time at all.

07:12.062 --> 07:13.061
What are you talking about?

07:13.163 --> 07:14.195
I've got my lead.

07:14.264 --> 07:17.065
Tracy Freeze! Unhappy at work.
Unhappy in love.

07:17.167 --> 07:19.100
She wanted it all, and she got it.

07:19.169 --> 07:20.535
Or at least
that's what she tells herself,

07:20.604 --> 07:22.871
alone on her coffee break,
which is actually a smoke break.

07:22.973 --> 07:24.506
Which is actually...

07:24.608 --> 07:27.141
Well, let's just say
Tracy has her vices.

07:27.210 --> 07:29.310
Okay, she also happens to be my boss

07:29.379 --> 07:30.712
and is a bit of a hard-ass,

07:30.780 --> 07:32.313
so please just stay away from her, okay?

07:32.382 --> 07:33.982
Stay in here, don't get into trouble.

07:34.050 --> 07:35.583
If you need me,
I'll be in hair and makeup.

07:36.887 --> 07:38.887
Hi. Can you take me
to Tracy Freeze's desk?

07:38.955 --> 07:40.421
It's probably the one
with too much paperwork

07:40.524 --> 07:41.789
and not enough family photos.

07:41.892 --> 07:43.291
Come on.

07:46.830 --> 07:47.873
Didn't you get my text?

07:47.905 --> 07:49.271
I can't hang out tonight. Graham's here.

07:49.332 --> 07:50.498
Oh. Sorry.

07:50.600 --> 07:51.733
Um, I can go.

07:51.835 --> 07:53.101
Okay.

07:53.169 --> 07:54.435
Or...

07:54.504 --> 07:55.770
I can meet him.

07:55.872 --> 07:57.338
I mean, we gotta do this
sometime, right?

07:57.407 --> 08:00.141
- Why not tonight?
- Because I have a vision in my head

08:00.210 --> 08:02.143
of how I want it to go,
and I want it to be perfect.

08:02.245 --> 08:03.645
There's no such thing as perfect.

08:03.713 --> 08:05.313
But maybe we should
just let this happen.

08:05.382 --> 08:06.781
Whatever it is, it'll be great.

08:06.883 --> 08:08.049
Mom?

08:08.118 --> 08:09.551
Who's this?

08:09.653 --> 08:11.653
Oh. Uh... God.

08:11.755 --> 08:12.954
Okay, um...

08:15.458 --> 08:17.158
...guess we're doing this right now.

08:17.227 --> 08:19.661
Uh, Graham, this is...

08:19.763 --> 08:21.896
Hey, Graham.

08:21.998 --> 08:23.131
I'm Owen.

08:23.233 --> 08:25.300
And I'm your mom's special friend.

08:27.000 --> 08:33.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:35.879 --> 08:36.910
Ahh!

08:38.432 --> 08:39.640
Graham!

08:40.399 --> 08:43.360
What was that, Graham?
I've never seen you punch anything.

08:43.422 --> 08:45.189
I-I don't know what happened.

08:45.276 --> 08:46.542
He said "special friend,"

08:46.644 --> 08:49.311
and then my fist was in his eye.

08:49.380 --> 08:51.356
It was pure animal instinct.

08:51.435 --> 08:54.304
This is the single best moment
of my entire life.

08:54.373 --> 08:56.607
I could hear the punch
from the other room.

08:56.675 --> 08:58.709
It sounded so meaty.

08:58.811 --> 09:00.644
I'm gonna go check on Owen.

09:07.586 --> 09:09.253
Hey. You know when you think
of the worst-case scenario

09:09.355 --> 09:10.854
but you didn't go big enough?

09:10.923 --> 09:12.789
This is bad, Owen... really bad.

09:12.891 --> 09:14.124
Okay, okay, maybe you were right.

09:14.193 --> 09:15.626
This was not meant to happen tonight.

09:15.728 --> 09:17.761
But now it is happening. Okay?
And it has to be beautiful.

09:17.863 --> 09:19.162
Not just two seconds of chitchat

09:19.265 --> 09:20.797
and some random act of violence.

09:20.899 --> 09:21.898
Is he okay?

09:22.001 --> 09:24.401
I thought my strongest muscle
was my heart,

09:24.470 --> 09:26.503
but apparently, it's my right bicep.

09:26.572 --> 09:28.472
You guys are gonna
really like each other

09:28.574 --> 09:30.274
once you find some common ground.

09:30.342 --> 09:32.876
I mean, you're both dudes, right?

09:32.945 --> 09:34.177
I am a dude.

09:34.246 --> 09:35.746
Me too. Also a dude.

09:35.814 --> 09:37.714
So we're off to the races.

09:37.816 --> 09:40.050
Did you order pizza,
or are we on our own?

09:40.119 --> 09:41.485
You're on your own.
All right, we just need

09:41.553 --> 09:43.487
to find some dude stuff
for you guys to bond over.

09:43.555 --> 09:44.788
I mean, how about...

09:44.857 --> 09:46.290
...mowing grass?

09:46.358 --> 09:47.524
We don't have a lawnmower.

09:47.593 --> 09:49.826
Uh, what about Pac-Man?

09:49.895 --> 09:51.328
Gossiping at the barbershop?

09:51.397 --> 09:54.164
Uh, putting food inside another food?

09:54.266 --> 09:56.533
Have you met a man before?

09:56.635 --> 09:58.168
Um, help me out here. Googling "boobs"?

09:58.237 --> 10:00.103
Okay, gendering things
might be outdated,

10:00.205 --> 10:02.139
but you are really bad at it.

10:02.207 --> 10:04.041
Angie, can I talk to you for
a second over by the toaster?

10:04.143 --> 10:05.809
Oh! Toaster! Hot stuff!

10:05.911 --> 10:06.977
Toast? Bread?

10:07.079 --> 10:08.478
Boxers or briefs?

10:08.580 --> 10:09.746
Why are you being so weird?

10:09.815 --> 10:13.617
I've never introduced Graham
to a boyfriend before.

10:13.719 --> 10:14.718
Wait, really?

10:15.688 --> 10:16.787
I had no idea.

10:16.889 --> 10:18.422
I'm honored.

10:18.524 --> 10:19.723
And I'm on it.

10:19.825 --> 10:20.724
Um...

10:20.793 --> 10:22.192
I know. We'll play catch.

10:22.261 --> 10:23.794
It's classic, American.

10:23.862 --> 10:26.063
Graham's punching hand will
safely be tucked inside a glove.

10:26.131 --> 10:27.464
Yes! All right, I'm gonna go

10:27.533 --> 10:29.433
steal some mitts
from our neighbor's yard.

10:30.869 --> 10:33.170
Yeah, that'll be five chow meins.

10:33.272 --> 10:35.839
And extra duck sauce.

10:35.941 --> 10:37.441
You got your dad's card?

10:39.211 --> 10:40.577
Okay, let's go through this again.

10:40.679 --> 10:42.379
When KBS gets here,
what are you gonna do?

10:42.481 --> 10:43.880
I will compliment her purse.

10:43.949 --> 10:45.782
- Yes.
- I will ask about her

10:45.884 --> 10:47.384
and other items of adult interest.

10:47.486 --> 10:48.719
- Yes!
- I got this!

10:48.821 --> 10:49.886
Summer of...

10:49.988 --> 10:50.854
Miggy.

10:51.824 --> 10:53.123
What's up?

10:54.827 --> 10:55.926
I like your purse.

10:58.163 --> 10:59.329
Yes!

10:59.431 --> 11:00.397
This is gonna be it, huh?

11:00.499 --> 11:01.965
Great news. Miggy's good.

11:02.034 --> 11:03.767
So if we leave now, we still
have time to get the potatoes.

11:03.869 --> 11:04.801
Not now, Poppy!

11:04.870 --> 11:06.403
Booty and Dagger are on the ropes,

11:06.505 --> 11:08.004
Insta-Steve's on fire,

11:08.073 --> 11:10.073
and we just have to sink
one more in the suds

11:10.142 --> 11:11.375
for the chug and win!

11:11.443 --> 11:13.377
Wait a minute. Are you having fun?

11:13.479 --> 11:16.346
No! I'm just finishing the game
that you forced me to play.

11:16.448 --> 11:18.415
Silence!

11:18.484 --> 11:20.650
♪ I set the bar for
all of these under-par cities ♪

11:20.753 --> 11:22.185
♪ I made varsity ♪

11:24.957 --> 11:26.523
That's what I'm talking about!

11:26.625 --> 11:28.258
Did you like that? Yes!

11:30.629 --> 11:32.062
What? I am not having fun.

11:32.131 --> 11:34.197
Yeah. That's exactly what it looks like.

11:34.299 --> 11:35.932
Where we at, player?

11:36.034 --> 11:38.468
Great. Just stay close,
'cause I sweat a lot.

11:38.570 --> 11:40.904
Hey, there, Sport. Guy McCormick.

11:40.973 --> 11:42.472
I'd shake your hand, but my fingers

11:42.541 --> 11:44.040
are completely shattered.

11:44.109 --> 11:46.209
Uh, Will Cooper. It's nice to meet you.

11:46.311 --> 11:47.911
I'm sorry.
I thought you were off tonight.

11:47.980 --> 11:50.680
I was, but Tracy called.
Said it was an emergency.

11:50.749 --> 11:52.449
Sorry you got all dolled up for nothing.

11:52.518 --> 11:53.750
But hey, you look tremendous.

11:53.819 --> 11:55.152
Take yourself to dinner.

11:55.220 --> 11:58.355
Nothing like hitting the town
in a full face of makeup.

11:58.424 --> 11:59.856
I'm Guy McCormick.

11:59.958 --> 12:01.525
I know.

12:01.627 --> 12:04.327
I think it's a day
for the big brush, Billy.

12:07.399 --> 12:09.733
They brought in Guy McCormick
to do the weather tonight.

12:09.802 --> 12:12.002
Oh. I hope that's not
because I talked to Tracy.

12:12.104 --> 12:13.437
You talked to Tracy?

12:13.539 --> 12:15.105
How long are you going to follow me?

12:15.207 --> 12:16.907
Until you get to where
you're going, Freeze.

12:16.975 --> 12:19.075
Do you even know where that is?
Have you ever known?

12:19.178 --> 12:21.111
Honestly, I'm just focused
on ditching you.

12:21.180 --> 12:23.847
- Did you just sign that birthday card?
- Sure did, boo boo.

12:23.949 --> 12:25.876
Next on the agenda...
why are you so tough on Will?

12:25.939 --> 12:27.984
I'm not tough. I am fair.

12:28.086 --> 12:29.219
Does Will say I'm tough?

12:29.288 --> 12:31.288
More specifically,
he called you a hard... ass.

12:31.390 --> 12:32.556
What?!

12:32.658 --> 12:33.824
This isn't happening.

12:33.926 --> 12:35.292
Cost of doing business.

12:35.394 --> 12:36.560
Why would you do that?

12:36.662 --> 12:38.728
Why do I find the story?
'Cause it's my job.

12:38.831 --> 12:40.964
No! It's literally my job.

12:41.033 --> 12:43.467
If I even have a job anymore,
thanks to you, Rory!

12:43.569 --> 12:45.101
All right. I'm sorry.

12:45.170 --> 12:46.703
I just wanted to help.

12:46.805 --> 12:49.206
Well, now I have to go find
Tracy and do damage control.

12:50.209 --> 12:52.876
That anger you're feeling?
That's life, baby!

12:54.112 --> 12:56.379
Oh. Hey. I'm Miggy's friend Poppy.

12:56.482 --> 12:57.647
Mm-hmm.

12:57.749 --> 13:00.183
Cool. Cool. Okay.

13:00.252 --> 13:02.252
Uh, so, where's Miggy?

13:02.354 --> 13:03.987
I sent him to get me ice.

13:04.056 --> 13:07.057
He kept talking about his son
and how he can almost walk.

13:07.159 --> 13:08.892
I mean, big deal. We can all walk.

13:08.994 --> 13:09.893
Huh.

13:09.995 --> 13:11.561
I was psyched to see him tonight.

13:11.663 --> 13:13.230
We had vibes back in the day.

13:13.332 --> 13:15.232
Now I guess he's just a boring dad.

13:18.504 --> 13:19.669
Miggy, she didn't mean that.

13:19.771 --> 13:20.604
You know what?

13:20.706 --> 13:21.771
I didn't want to say anything,

13:21.840 --> 13:23.406
but I saw her take drugs.

13:23.509 --> 13:25.942
She meant it. KBS is brutally honest.

13:26.044 --> 13:28.278
You can ask anyone in our crew.
She's our Lincoln.

13:28.380 --> 13:29.779
No. Miggy...

13:32.518 --> 13:33.650
Douglas, we got an emergency.

13:33.719 --> 13:35.519
I can't, Poppy. I'm in the zone.

13:35.621 --> 13:38.048
Beer pong is my new potatoes.

13:38.116 --> 13:40.056
- Well, the...
- Sss, sss!

13:43.695 --> 13:44.628
Yes!

13:44.696 --> 13:46.897
Cannot be denied!

13:53.205 --> 13:55.272
All right, guys,
I like what I'm seeing here.

13:55.374 --> 13:57.274
Strong arms! Full hearts!

13:57.376 --> 13:59.543
- This lady's lost it.
- Uh-huh.

13:59.645 --> 14:01.011
C'mon. Angie had a vision.

14:01.113 --> 14:03.046
I think it has something
to do with Norman Rockwell.

14:03.148 --> 14:04.915
How are we the same age as you?

14:05.456 --> 14:07.083
Graham, you're doing great!

14:07.185 --> 14:08.852
Really, tell me if you guys need any,

14:08.954 --> 14:10.086
you know, cowboy hats.

14:10.188 --> 14:13.223
I'm starting to understand
the appeal of this.

14:13.325 --> 14:16.192
Yeah. It's kind of meditative.

14:16.295 --> 14:18.495
It's like you give and you receive.

14:18.597 --> 14:20.063
Give and you receive.

14:20.165 --> 14:22.265
Careful! Don't hit that succulent.

14:22.367 --> 14:23.600
I would never.

14:23.702 --> 14:25.101
It's a Barbary fig.

14:25.203 --> 14:28.038
Are you hearing this, Mom?
Owen's a plant bro, too!

14:29.041 --> 14:30.373
Oh, my God!

14:31.420 --> 14:33.419
Quick, what was your
kindergarten teacher's name?

14:33.443 --> 14:34.873
- I don't know.
- Oh, my God.

14:34.898 --> 14:36.122
That's 'cause you have a concussion.

14:36.123 --> 14:38.862
No, it's because she quit
to work at that gas station

14:38.929 --> 14:40.057
to make more money.

14:41.206 --> 14:42.305
This is only fair.

14:42.363 --> 14:44.793
I took a swing,
he took a shot right back.

14:44.861 --> 14:46.861
Graham, he didn't hit you on purpose.

14:46.964 --> 14:48.930
He was probably just nervous.

14:49.032 --> 14:50.332
Like you were.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.600
I knew I'd meet your boyfriend someday.

14:52.703 --> 14:54.302
What, are you gonna stay single?

14:54.371 --> 14:55.670
You're a hot tamale.

14:57.007 --> 14:59.975
But I didn't expect
to feel so weird about it.

15:00.043 --> 15:03.645
You can feel as weird
as you want to, buddy.

15:03.670 --> 15:04.656
I get it.

15:04.681 --> 15:06.214
I'm nervous, too.

15:06.283 --> 15:09.050
This is new territory for both of us.

15:09.152 --> 15:12.487
But hey, we're getting through it.

15:12.556 --> 15:15.890
Not unscathed, but still, through it.

15:15.993 --> 15:17.892
I actually like Owen.

15:17.961 --> 15:19.027
Good.

15:19.096 --> 15:21.206
I feel like I've met him before.

15:21.231 --> 15:22.307
But you haven't.

15:22.332 --> 15:24.632
No, today was the first time.

15:24.701 --> 15:25.900
Graham.

15:25.969 --> 15:27.068
Oh, thank God you're okay.

15:27.170 --> 15:29.104
I know I look athletic, but I'm not.

15:29.172 --> 15:31.072
Don't worry about it. We're even.

15:31.174 --> 15:33.375
Pretty good shot you got me with.

15:33.477 --> 15:35.510
I won't hesitate to defend my lady.

15:35.579 --> 15:37.245
I could teach you some moves.

15:37.347 --> 15:38.580
Oh, yeah?

15:38.682 --> 15:40.181
All right. I could use a lesson.

15:40.283 --> 15:42.283
I'm ready for you this time,
though. What do you got?

15:42.352 --> 15:44.619
- So, we got one, two, three, four, jab...
- Oh, oh, oh, oh!

15:44.688 --> 15:46.565
- ...karate chop, karate chop, karate chop...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:46.590 --> 15:47.599
...and then, um...

15:47.624 --> 15:48.957
Hey, Angie?

15:49.059 --> 15:50.125
Yeah?

15:50.227 --> 15:51.993
We've been talking, and, well...

15:52.095 --> 15:53.628
where's Rory?

15:56.933 --> 15:57.732
Garbage.

15:57.834 --> 15:58.666
Garbage.

15:58.769 --> 15:59.667
This is okay.

15:59.736 --> 16:00.769
And garbage.

16:00.871 --> 16:04.272
Tracy, can I just say
I'm so sorry about Rory.

16:04.341 --> 16:07.142
Sorry for how he pitched me
the game show "Scenarios!"

16:07.244 --> 16:09.277
or for how he said
you think I'm a hard-ass?

16:09.346 --> 16:11.379
- He pitched you "Scenarios!"?
- Yes, he did.

16:11.448 --> 16:12.747
Well, then maybe I should be
saying "You're welcome."

16:12.816 --> 16:13.982
No.

16:14.051 --> 16:15.383
Okay, I'll apologize, then.

16:15.452 --> 16:17.285
Rory just has it in his mind

16:17.354 --> 16:20.488
that a news station
should be full of scandal.

16:20.590 --> 16:22.757
And when he saw that there
wasn't any, he made some up.

16:22.826 --> 16:24.359
So you didn't say I'm a hard-ass?

16:24.428 --> 16:26.995
No way, José. I said it.
I feel very bad about it, too.

16:27.097 --> 16:29.564
But if I'm being honest...

16:29.633 --> 16:32.534
i-it's just because I-I'm
a little intimidated by you.

16:32.602 --> 16:34.436
You make me nervous,

16:34.504 --> 16:37.205
and I think it's 'cause
I think very highly of you.

16:38.475 --> 16:40.508
Oh.

16:40.610 --> 16:43.845
Well, I... You know, I think
very... highly of you, too.

16:43.947 --> 16:44.813
You do?

16:44.881 --> 16:47.515
Yeah, you're really blossoming.

16:47.617 --> 16:48.683
As a weatherman.

16:49.719 --> 16:51.252
And I'm very sorry if that was weird.

16:51.321 --> 16:53.455
No. Thank you for saying nice stuff.

16:56.159 --> 16:57.425
McCormick.

16:57.527 --> 16:58.460
You're off.

16:58.562 --> 16:59.661
Come back when your arm is healed.

16:59.763 --> 17:01.196
I can't have the weather
reported by someone

17:01.264 --> 17:02.964
who's always pointing to Bakersfield.

17:03.033 --> 17:05.165
Well, I'm not letting
this contouring go to waste.

17:05.268 --> 17:07.734
Daddy's going to dinner.

17:08.939 --> 17:10.738
- He took that well.
- Uh-huh.

17:10.840 --> 17:12.740
So you're back on.

17:12.809 --> 17:13.741
Don't let me down.

17:13.844 --> 17:15.009
I won't.

17:16.646 --> 17:18.179
And there it is.

17:18.248 --> 17:21.015
Ladies and gentlemen,
the twist no one saw coming.

17:21.117 --> 17:22.650
We are in a love story!

17:22.752 --> 17:24.319
- What?
- You and Freeze.

17:24.421 --> 17:26.087
No! That's crazy.

17:26.189 --> 17:27.555
Just admit it... I'm onto something.

17:27.656 --> 17:28.556
You're blushing.

17:28.625 --> 17:30.458
I am not! It's rouge!

17:30.560 --> 17:32.460
Billy got me all tarted up.

17:32.562 --> 17:33.728
I know rouge.

17:33.830 --> 17:35.063
That ain't rouge.

17:38.235 --> 17:39.300
No.

17:41.938 --> 17:43.538
Yes. I like that one.

17:47.811 --> 17:49.511
So, how you doing?

17:49.613 --> 17:50.478
Not great.

17:50.580 --> 17:51.813
Apparently, I'm old now.

17:51.882 --> 17:53.615
Not old old, like you and D-glas.

17:53.640 --> 17:54.659
No offense.

17:54.684 --> 17:56.718
Well, he's... t... Sure.

17:56.820 --> 17:58.987
But, like, not cool. Or fun.

17:59.055 --> 18:01.556
Hey, remember that thing
you said a while back

18:01.625 --> 18:02.790
about how after you had Rory,

18:02.893 --> 18:04.225
you couldn't go out
without thinking about him?

18:04.294 --> 18:05.927
That was this morning,
so, yes, I remember.

18:06.029 --> 18:07.095
- Was it?!
- Mm-hmm.

18:07.164 --> 18:09.029
God, it's been a long day.

18:09.091 --> 18:11.733
Anyway, when you said that,
I thought... "What a loser.

18:11.835 --> 18:14.202
I'm never gonna be that."

18:14.271 --> 18:16.037
But... maybe I am.

18:16.106 --> 18:18.006
But it doesn't have to be a bad thing.

18:18.108 --> 18:20.408
Miggy, you're growing up,
just like Jack.

18:20.510 --> 18:24.245
My advice... stop looking back
and enjoy moving forward.

18:26.049 --> 18:28.082
Yeah. You're right.

18:31.488 --> 18:33.021
Stop the music!

18:33.123 --> 18:34.789
Stop the beer pong!

18:34.891 --> 18:36.291
Oh!

18:36.393 --> 18:38.226
That means you, too, Douglas!

18:38.328 --> 18:40.094
I'm not done with you, Tre Tre.

18:40.163 --> 18:41.840
Make this quick.

18:41.918 --> 18:44.165
Look, Summer of Miggy
was a beautiful thing,

18:44.267 --> 18:46.067
but this baby boy's
having a growth spurt.

18:46.169 --> 18:48.203
Some might say into a "boring dad."

18:48.271 --> 18:50.905
But I like who I am now.

18:50.974 --> 18:52.874
Also, why don't we start these
things a little earlier, huh?

18:52.976 --> 18:54.242
How about 4:00 to 8:00?

18:54.344 --> 18:55.944
'Cause then this way,
you can still get dinner after.

18:56.046 --> 18:57.879
And then, bam, we're in bed by 9:30!

18:57.981 --> 18:59.047
Who's with me?!

19:00.383 --> 19:01.316
Huh?!

19:02.719 --> 19:03.685
I just got a text.

19:03.753 --> 19:05.320
After-party at Dwayne's house!

19:06.590 --> 19:07.722
Dwayne!

19:07.824 --> 19:09.190
Are you crazy, Miggy?!

19:09.292 --> 19:10.892
I-I'm having...

19:10.994 --> 19:12.160
Just admit it!

19:12.262 --> 19:15.363
Fun! I'm having fun, okay?

19:15.432 --> 19:16.731
That's right.

19:18.935 --> 19:20.235
Hey.

19:20.303 --> 19:22.337
I really like how you yelled
at everyone like that.

19:22.405 --> 19:24.239
I got daddy issues. I was into it.

19:24.307 --> 19:25.673
That's what's up.

19:25.775 --> 19:29.077
So, are you really gonna
kick all of us out?

19:32.249 --> 19:33.411
I am.

19:33.436 --> 19:34.444
And I'll text you.

19:34.484 --> 19:36.751
But... there's only one person

19:36.820 --> 19:38.219
I really want to chill with tonight.

19:38.321 --> 19:40.221
Oh, my God!
Guys, I think he's gonna do it!

19:40.323 --> 19:42.457
He's gonna do it.
Come here! Come here! Come here!

19:42.559 --> 19:44.092
- Go, Jack.
- Okay, okay.

19:44.194 --> 19:45.927
- You can do it.
- He's gonna do it! Oh, my God!

19:46.029 --> 19:47.612
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- He's gonna do it, he's gonna...

19:48.965 --> 19:51.299
He's going! Go, Jack! Guys!

19:51.401 --> 19:53.468
- Oh, he's back up! He got back up!
- Yay!

19:53.570 --> 19:55.103
- Baby boy!
- You're right, it is like me

19:55.205 --> 19:56.638
- after two glasses of wine.
- See?

19:56.740 --> 19:58.806
- Yes! He's gonna do it!
- Come on, Jack!

19:58.908 --> 20:01.242
He's gonna do it! Oh, my God!

20:01.344 --> 20:02.377
- Do it!
- Do it!

20:05.081 --> 20:07.315
He's going to Daddy!
He's going to Daddy!

20:11.354 --> 20:13.955
My baby walked! Yes!

20:14.057 --> 20:16.057
We can all be impressed,
but to be honest,

20:16.159 --> 20:17.732
he should have been walking months ago.

20:17.809 --> 20:19.053
Cut it out.

20:21.311 --> 20:22.926
Hey, can you pass me
that viper's bowstring?

20:23.011 --> 20:25.721
Yeah. Plant it right next
to the tiger tooth aloe.

20:25.746 --> 20:28.308
Oh. You have quite the way
with terrarium design.

20:28.332 --> 20:29.363
You get that from your mom?

20:29.402 --> 20:31.665
No. She's a black thumb.

20:31.705 --> 20:34.542
I don't know how, but she once
killed a fake plant.

20:34.574 --> 20:36.943
Yeah, she had a plant
on her desk at work once.

20:36.976 --> 20:38.211
After a few weeks,

20:38.245 --> 20:39.649
it was noticeably growing <i> away</i> from her.

20:40.714 --> 20:42.283
O... kay.

20:42.315 --> 20:43.861
I'm really happy to see
you guys are bonding,

20:43.886 --> 20:45.188
but can we pick a new lane?

20:46.586 --> 20:47.921
She's the best, isn't she?

20:47.955 --> 20:50.224
Yeah. She is.

20:51.457 --> 20:53.187
So, you gonna marry her or what?

20:55.428 --> 20:56.964
- Um...
- Um...
