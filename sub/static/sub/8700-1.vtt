03:11.024 --> 03:14.255
-Are you sure?
-Yes, that's him.

03:14.928 --> 03:17.897
That's Bernie Lomax.
I'd recognize that smirk anywhere.

03:18.898 --> 03:23.198
Do you think you could put him back now?
Please?

03:23.303 --> 03:25.362
I've seen my share of dead people today.

03:25.605 --> 03:28.438
-See you.
-Just leave him there, all right?

03:28.608 --> 03:31.133
Every Labor Day it's the same thing
over and over again.

03:31.244 --> 03:36.079
The bodies keep piling up and piling up.
Big bodies, little bodies....

03:39.953 --> 03:42.581
-Do you need us anymore?
-I've got some papers here to sign.

03:42.689 --> 03:45.157
-He's got papers for you to sign.
-Go ahead, sign them.

03:45.258 --> 03:47.226
I don't want to sign them.
You must sign them.

03:47.327 --> 03:49.352
You have better penmanship than I do.

03:51.998 --> 03:54.330
They were around here a minute ago.
Just....

03:55.568 --> 03:58.401
I don't suppose you could hurry up?
We'll be late for work.

03:58.504 --> 04:00.631
We got a big raise today. Promotion day.

04:00.740 --> 04:03.231
I'd settle for an office
with my very own door.

04:03.343 --> 04:04.503
You are getting a door.

04:04.611 --> 04:07.409
We're back from picking up
after that gas barbecue explosion.

04:07.513 --> 04:09.572
-How many did you get?
-Three and a half.

04:12.051 --> 04:13.018
Put them in the back.

04:15.521 --> 04:16.488
Sign here.

04:17.423 --> 04:21.882
If I sign this, does that obligate me
to pay for his funeral?

04:22.028 --> 04:25.862
No. It's just for his personal effects.

04:30.670 --> 04:33.298
-You're related to him, aren't you?
-He was my uncle.

04:36.009 --> 04:40.639
Do you have a pen? Thank you.
I was very close.

04:44.350 --> 04:45.749
Your uncle?

04:45.852 --> 04:48.286
-I'm walking here!
-So am I!

04:49.522 --> 04:51.149
So what? The guy had no family.

04:51.257 --> 04:53.350
None that's gonna admit to him, anyway.

04:54.527 --> 04:57.894
Wait. Couldn't you just save
the grave robbing for later?

04:58.031 --> 05:00.090
Do what you need to do,
but not in front of me.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.392
Whatever.

05:05.505 --> 05:06.972
Here they are, sir.

05:07.073 --> 05:08.563
-After you.
-Hello.

05:09.609 --> 05:12.874
You're the ones that discovered
Lomax's theft from the company.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.777
-That's us.
-Yes, sir. I'm Richard Parker.

05:15.882 --> 05:17.543
Larry Wilson. Really it was nothing.

05:17.650 --> 05:20.483
Anybody with half a brain
could have figured it out.

05:20.653 --> 05:22.086
Is that so?

05:23.056 --> 05:24.250
This is Arthur Hummel...

05:24.390 --> 05:26.881
...Internal Investigation Department
of the company.

05:27.927 --> 05:30.555
Arthur? Richard Parker.

05:30.697 --> 05:34.963
-It's a pleasure to meet you.
-Guess we kind of saved your ass.

05:35.134 --> 05:38.934
I mean, Bernard was really raping
the company right under your nose.

05:39.605 --> 05:41.436
-Thank you.
-No sweat!

05:41.741 --> 05:43.936
That's right, you were with Bernie Lomax...

05:44.043 --> 05:46.341
...on Hampton Island
when he was murdered.

05:47.246 --> 05:50.545
We were there the whole weekend.
It's awful. A tragic story.

05:50.783 --> 05:53.581
Hell of a house, though.
He had a heated pool on the beach.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.176
-What?
-Chicks....

05:56.289 --> 05:59.850
I'm just being curious,
but what were you doing there?

06:08.267 --> 06:09.962
Working.

06:10.103 --> 06:14.972
Yes. A few days earlier
we had uncovered some duplicate policies.

06:17.877 --> 06:20.311
$2 million worth,
with Lomax as beneficiary.

06:27.887 --> 06:31.846
Yes, naturally we also assumed
it was an error.

06:31.958 --> 06:35.155
Then Mr. Lomax invited us
to his beach house to discuss the matter.

06:35.328 --> 06:37.296
-Discuss it.
-That's what Larry told me.

06:37.530 --> 06:41.159
I'm just curious, why didn't you go
to someone besides Bernie Lomax?

06:41.267 --> 06:45.761
Weren't you just the least bit suspicious
that your friend...

06:46.038 --> 06:46.970
No.

06:47.306 --> 06:50.275
...was the named beneficiary
in the phony policies?

06:50.376 --> 06:53.470
That's wrong. He wasn't my friend,
he was Richie's friend.

06:53.579 --> 06:55.877
He wasn't my friend.
Lomax tried to kill us.

06:56.015 --> 06:58.745
Then he tried to have us framed
for what he was stealing.

06:58.918 --> 06:59.976
I don't buy it.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.054
There's nothing to buy. It's the truth.

07:02.155 --> 07:03.679
It's a fact, Jack.

07:06.559 --> 07:07.787
I've heard enough.

07:08.528 --> 07:11.895
-There seems to be a gray area here.
-There certainly does, sir.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.959
And, frankly, I don't think
our bonding company would cover you.

07:16.502 --> 07:17.434
That's okay.

07:18.638 --> 07:20.299
You'll receive two weeks severance.

07:21.274 --> 07:25.404
-That's like instead of the raise?
-No, that's like we've just been fired.

07:28.347 --> 07:29.780
You're firing me?

07:29.882 --> 07:34.910
Don't go back to your offices.
And don't try to take any papers with you.

07:35.021 --> 07:36.215
We didn't do anything wrong.

07:36.322 --> 07:39.291
-We were working for the company.
-You're firing me? Don't beg!

07:39.425 --> 07:42.588
I'm willing to beg on my hands and knees.
I just want my door!

07:42.728 --> 07:44.161
You got your door!

07:44.630 --> 07:46.996
Do me a favor, blow me.

07:49.702 --> 07:53.103
I don't buy their story.
They know where the money is.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.273
I'll nail them.

07:57.276 --> 07:59.904
I hope so, for your sake.

08:01.047 --> 08:03.038
I've a stock holder's meeting
in two weeks...

08:03.516 --> 08:08.078
...and if I have to tell them that
this company is out $2 million...

08:09.689 --> 08:10.781
...you'll be out as well.

08:40.919 --> 08:44.822
$100,000 for a voodoo queen.
Don't you think that's a bit excessive?

08:45.958 --> 08:47.789
It beats losing a whole $1 million.

08:49.128 --> 08:51.562
How did I know
someone was gonna kill him?

08:52.965 --> 08:55.160
I have my doubts about this whole thing.

08:58.471 --> 09:01.634
They say that's the last person
who doubted the Mobu's power.

09:16.122 --> 09:18.556
I thought your friend said
there was a party tonight?

09:18.658 --> 09:20.523
Yeah, that's what he told me.

09:20.927 --> 09:22.451
Where's the liquor?

09:23.629 --> 09:24.755
Excuse me.

09:25.531 --> 09:27.055
Big-boned sister.

09:30.169 --> 09:32.967
Say, Holmes,
where are they hiding the Scotch?

09:39.512 --> 09:42.777
In the house. From New York.

09:49.989 --> 09:51.354
Is that Oprah?

09:52.758 --> 09:54.157
She obviously wants you.

09:58.130 --> 10:01.566
Go back to New York.
Carry out these instructions.

10:02.902 --> 10:05.871
What? No, you misunderstand.

10:05.972 --> 10:08.702
We don't wanna go home so soon,
we just kinda got here.

10:08.808 --> 10:13.074
-We came to see the carnival.
-Yeah, we don't wanna miss that.

10:17.283 --> 10:20.582
-You will do as I bid.
-Right.

10:21.988 --> 10:23.353
Go to New York.

10:24.023 --> 10:26.423
Raise this man from the dead.

10:27.526 --> 10:30.791
He'll lead you to where he has hidden
the cartel's money.

10:32.031 --> 10:35.558
Follow my conjure precisely
for the magic to work.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.963
You will need this.

10:46.545 --> 10:47.807
And this.

11:03.329 --> 11:06.662
-Excuse me.
-That's ok. I'm just here with my friend.

11:10.202 --> 11:11.669
Go right ahead.

11:16.108 --> 11:19.942
How're you doing? I was waiting outside.
I don't know, a half an hour?

11:20.680 --> 11:23.740
Are you crazy? This is the most expensive
restaurant in New York.

11:24.483 --> 11:25.711
You still wear pajamas.

11:26.118 --> 11:29.019
If you called me in the middle of the night
to loan you money--

11:29.121 --> 11:31.954
Your mother doesn't like you
getting the sheets all sweaty.

11:32.058 --> 11:34.720
What's the big emergency?
Why did you call?

11:36.028 --> 11:37.586
I found this in Bernie's wallet.

11:37.730 --> 11:41.166
It's a key to a safety deposit box
in St. Thomas.

11:42.568 --> 11:45.162
Okay. This is why you woke me up?

11:45.304 --> 11:49.400
I have three job interviews in the morning
and I'd like to go back to sleep.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.404
Don't you read the <i>Post</i> ?

11:51.577 --> 11:56.537
It's like this off-shore money laundering.
It's like that Vesco guy, Michael Milken.

11:57.383 --> 12:00.875
I'm willing to bet you
that's the $2 million that Lomax stole.

12:01.020 --> 12:02.783
Now, there's a code on the thing.

12:02.888 --> 12:07.416
All we need to do is tap into
the computer at work.

12:07.927 --> 12:09.827
That presents a little problem.

12:10.296 --> 12:11.627
First, it's illegal.

12:11.931 --> 12:13.899
And two, we were fired today.

12:14.533 --> 12:17.229
How are we going to get access
to the computer?

12:19.505 --> 12:22.906
Oh, my God,
we're going to break in, aren't we?

12:23.109 --> 12:25.236
In a very narrow sense of the word,
that's true.

12:25.344 --> 12:28.507
I tell you what. You break in.
You enjoy yourself. You go to jail.

12:28.614 --> 12:30.206
The beauty part of the whole thing...

12:30.316 --> 12:33.774
...was all you had to do was work
the computer. I was gonna get us in.

12:33.886 --> 12:38.255
But fine. If you can't do it, that is fine.
I understand.

12:41.427 --> 12:42.792
I was just trying to help out.

12:42.928 --> 12:47.558
Because you're going to find it difficult
to find employment with this scandal...

12:47.733 --> 12:48.859
...hanging over your head.

12:53.272 --> 12:56.730
Ok. So I'll have to do
the little computer thing.

12:57.376 --> 12:59.367
-Your check, sir.
-Thank you.

13:03.149 --> 13:05.879
I put a little something extra
on there for you, sir.

13:06.085 --> 13:08.246
Thank you, Mr. Lomax.
That's very generous.

13:08.354 --> 13:09.446
Thank you.

13:12.057 --> 13:14.924
You're using Bernie's credit card.

13:15.761 --> 13:17.456
Five gold ones in there.

13:17.596 --> 13:21.191
I practiced his signature.
Got it down cold. I got extra.

13:21.400 --> 13:24.801
-Let's just get this over with.
-Whatever you like. Whatever you want.

13:28.007 --> 13:28.974
Shut up.

13:29.508 --> 13:33.171
-You had to drag me to that damn party.
-You wanted to go.

13:33.279 --> 13:35.975
I'll be pissed off if I miss carnival,
that's all I know.

13:36.081 --> 13:39.278
The quicker we do it,
the quicker we get back to the island.

13:39.385 --> 13:40.716
Yeah, I bet.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.870
It's clear, come on. Get the gurney.

14:03.108 --> 14:04.200
Come on.

14:11.383 --> 14:12.407
Wait.

14:13.986 --> 14:14.680
Back up, back up!

14:18.123 --> 14:19.090
Down there.

14:43.782 --> 14:47.980
Ain't this a bitch? Let's get him.

14:51.056 --> 14:53.286
What are you looking at?
You got a problem?

14:53.425 --> 14:54.824
Ain't none of my business.

14:54.927 --> 14:56.451
Now what are we gonna do?

14:56.996 --> 15:00.022
I don't know. Find a nice quiet spot
to do the do, you know?

15:01.600 --> 15:02.532
Right here.

15:04.937 --> 15:06.404
-I'll get the tickets.
-All right.

15:10.342 --> 15:11.274
What's up?

15:12.011 --> 15:13.740
Three, please.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.305
Make that two.

15:16.682 --> 15:19.173
All right, number one hundred sixteen.

15:19.885 --> 15:23.343
And one hundred seventeen.

15:23.822 --> 15:25.449
All right.

15:25.991 --> 15:30.325
Looking good. Got a lot of work in here.

15:31.530 --> 15:33.054
Let's go through the checklist.

15:33.198 --> 15:34.756
Let's see what we have.

15:35.868 --> 15:38.234
-We drew the chalk circle on the ground.
-Check.

15:38.337 --> 15:41.898
We lit one hundred seventeen candles.
They are burning.

15:42.808 --> 15:45.402
The potion, the goat urine
and the goat blood.

15:45.511 --> 15:48.571
That's your department.
I got nothing to do with that.

15:49.415 --> 15:52.942
We draw an "X" on the left side
of the potion, and a "T" on the right side.

15:54.853 --> 15:57.253
We're into the chicken now.
We're almost home.

15:58.524 --> 15:59.650
One thing.

16:03.896 --> 16:06.262
<i>As-salamo 'alaikum</i>
and <i>shalom</i> and everything.

16:06.398 --> 16:08.298
All right, let's do the chicken.

16:09.268 --> 16:10.758
<i>Voilà</i>, the <i>pollo</i>.

16:11.870 --> 16:13.599
Shut the door! What's wrong with you?

16:20.212 --> 16:22.180
Down in front, you're blocking the view!

16:22.281 --> 16:24.374
So what? What are you gonna do?

16:26.185 --> 16:28.210
Come see the Colonel, baby.

16:29.688 --> 16:30.655
Come on.

16:36.028 --> 16:37.222
Come here!

16:39.932 --> 16:41.923
-What are you doing?
-I lost a chicken.

16:42.201 --> 16:45.170
-Not this one. This one's with me!
-I'm sorry.

16:59.952 --> 17:01.442
Hey, that's my popcorn.

17:05.790 --> 17:07.452
-Did you find it?
-No.

17:18.604 --> 17:21.505
No, that's definitely out.
That ain't gonna work.

17:22.407 --> 17:24.239
Well, at least it's a chicken.

17:25.010 --> 17:28.810
Henry, we need a live bird.

17:32.151 --> 17:35.450
Where are we gonna find a live chicken
here in New York City?

17:41.427 --> 17:43.088
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

17:52.838 --> 17:55.671
Right into here, like this here.

17:58.944 --> 18:03.108
There we go.
Now, we're into the bone-tossing thing.

18:06.485 --> 18:08.350
You are in the power of the Mobu.

18:09.655 --> 18:12.385
You are in the power of the Mobu.

18:13.559 --> 18:16.119
You are in the power of the voodoo.

18:17.229 --> 18:18.696
Ain't nothing happening.

18:18.797 --> 18:21.766
Mobu ain't got no power.
Let me check our manual again.

18:23.268 --> 18:24.200
What?

18:24.336 --> 18:26.770
Did you do the "X"
on the left side of the potion?

18:26.905 --> 18:28.031
What?

18:30.375 --> 18:33.435
Easy. Under there. Slide it under.

18:36.582 --> 18:38.846
We did that.
I dropped a chicken on its feet.

18:51.230 --> 18:52.162
"Get down

18:55.134 --> 18:56.863
-"Get up
-"Get on up

18:57.236 --> 18:58.669
-"Get up
-"Get on up

18:59.138 --> 19:00.662
-"Get up
-"Get on up

19:00.939 --> 19:03.806
"Get on the scene, like a voodoo machine

19:09.181 --> 19:13.015
"The voodoo and the Mobu
The voodoo and the Mobu

19:13.118 --> 19:15.609
"The voodoo and the Mobu"

19:29.701 --> 19:33.364
It's like the Mobu said.
He's leading us to the money.

19:34.706 --> 19:36.264
All right, get the box.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.748
-Ain't this a bitch?
-Dead.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.080
As a doorknob.

19:49.354 --> 19:51.288
Don't panic. Just be cool.

19:51.390 --> 19:54.826
Come on, we got the Mobu manual,
we just start from square "A".

19:54.927 --> 19:56.224
You know, science.

19:56.828 --> 19:59.797
Stick him on the can.
Let's start all over again.

20:01.133 --> 20:05.001
The things I've got to deal with! I did
everything according to Mobu's manual.

20:05.103 --> 20:07.298
Draw a chalk circle on the ground: "A."

20:07.673 --> 20:09.163
Ring him in with some candles:

20:09.308 --> 20:12.539
"B," then there's the potion,
and then draw an "X" on the left side.

20:12.644 --> 20:15.078
And the "T," yeah, on the right side.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.814
Where are my chicken bones?

20:21.920 --> 20:23.785
I ain't got your chicken bones.

20:24.189 --> 20:27.625
-My chicken bones were just right here.
-No, l--

20:31.029 --> 20:32.587
He's doing it again.

20:41.807 --> 20:43.900
Shut the music off! Let's go!

20:47.446 --> 20:49.175
This is getting deep.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.287
All right! Hold tight.

20:58.724 --> 21:01.022
Let's just figure this out here.

21:01.126 --> 21:04.186
I wonder why he can only move
when the music's playing?

21:05.230 --> 21:07.198
Of course, look it's right here.

21:07.466 --> 21:10.299
We used the pigeon when we should have
used the chicken.

21:10.435 --> 21:13.461
That's why he can only move
when the music is playing.

21:14.573 --> 21:15.801
I don't think so.

21:16.675 --> 21:17.869
Turn it on.

21:28.587 --> 21:29.485
Off.

21:31.189 --> 21:32.156
On.

21:36.528 --> 21:38.223
Knowledge is power.

21:39.331 --> 21:41.891
Get the box and don't touch nothing.

21:43.568 --> 21:45.593
I wonder if this'll work on Elvis?

22:08.760 --> 22:11.285
-What's it say?
-Nothing.

22:13.231 --> 22:14.698
-You're right.
-What?

22:14.833 --> 22:17.393
Bernie does indeed have
a safe deposit box.

22:19.438 --> 22:21.167
-What's in it?
-I don't know.

22:21.273 --> 22:22.968
It's noted as a personal entry account.

22:23.075 --> 22:24.440
-A what?
-Personal entry account.

22:24.543 --> 22:25.510
What does it mean?

22:25.610 --> 22:29.068
The only one who can get in
is Bernie Lomax and he's dead now.

22:31.583 --> 22:35.713
-And so we can't get in?
-No. What?

22:38.590 --> 22:41.753
Now, just hear me out.

22:42.861 --> 22:45.955
We go back to the morgue,
we get the body, we go to St. Thomas...

22:46.098 --> 22:47.861
...we take Bernie to the bank just like--

22:47.999 --> 22:51.400
No way! Absolutely not!
I don't want to have any part of this.

22:51.503 --> 22:52.333
Why not?

22:52.437 --> 22:56.168
-Incidentally, you're seriously demented.
-Thank you.

22:56.608 --> 22:59.008
-Aren't we in enough trouble already?
-No, we aren't.

22:59.644 --> 23:02.169
You want us to sneak into a bank
in St. Thomas?

23:02.280 --> 23:03.406
Freeze!

23:14.760 --> 23:16.227
Take him up.

23:18.530 --> 23:19.497
What's up?

23:25.804 --> 23:26.930
Where's he going?

23:27.038 --> 23:29.438
I don't know.
He keeps trying to go someplace.

23:30.475 --> 23:32.272
Just hold onto him. Tight.

23:37.115 --> 23:39.242
Listen, better hold onto him.

23:44.156 --> 23:47.751
My box! He got my box! Stop, thief!

23:48.059 --> 23:49.026
Excuse me.

23:49.628 --> 23:53.587
Come on! Let's get him.

23:58.870 --> 24:00.804
Stop the train, man. Open the door!

24:05.777 --> 24:06.744
Damn.

24:11.917 --> 24:14.545
<i>-C'est la vie</i>
-Say what?

24:15.454 --> 24:16.421
<i>C'est la vie</i>

24:16.521 --> 24:20.013
Don't cuss at me in no foreign tongue.
You got something to say, say it.

24:20.125 --> 24:23.617
-Don't be pointin' at me.
-Point, point, point!

24:25.397 --> 24:26.421
I'm sorry.

24:36.241 --> 24:38.209
Get off! We're trying to fight.

24:39.110 --> 24:40.236
<i>You boys are lucky</i>

24:40.345 --> 24:43.473
Called the insurance company.
They said since nothing was stolen...

24:43.582 --> 24:45.675
...charges can be reduced
to simple trespassing.

24:45.784 --> 24:48.309
Can I get a PBA card?

24:48.420 --> 24:51.150
-Look, you'll have to post bail.
-Do you take plastic?

24:51.289 --> 24:53.553
-Cash.
-All right, we'll pay cash.

24:53.658 --> 24:57.594
See the clerk at the front desk.
Stay out of places where you don't belong.

24:57.729 --> 25:01.221
Yes, Officer, we learned our lesson.
We'll never break the law again.

25:01.833 --> 25:02.765
Good.

25:07.939 --> 25:09.930
-Thanks, Ralph, I owe you one.
-Sure.

25:11.042 --> 25:13.374
I'm gonna nail those two little shits.

25:13.778 --> 25:16.508
You sure they're guilty?
They look kinda stupid.

25:16.615 --> 25:18.674
Yeah, too stupid.

25:20.519 --> 25:23.454
I'm gonna put you wise guys in jail
for twenty-four hours.

25:23.555 --> 25:25.455
That should cool you off.

25:38.637 --> 25:40.537
Check this sap out.

25:50.582 --> 25:53.050
Better call the coroner. This one's dead.

26:00.025 --> 26:01.788
Wait a minute, I know this guy.

26:03.828 --> 26:05.796
I know him. What's wrong with you guys?

26:06.131 --> 26:10.261
-He's been here before.
-Yeah, sure. Get some rest.

26:14.506 --> 26:18.306
-You got a plan, once we go inside?
-Do not insult my intelligence.

26:18.410 --> 26:21.106
-Your intelligence?
-Have I ever let you down?

26:27.452 --> 26:30.046
Just relax. The guy thinks he's my uncle.

26:30.155 --> 26:32.248
We just tell him
we're here to claim the body...

26:32.357 --> 26:34.325
...and to bury him in the family plot.

26:36.461 --> 26:40.124
Hello. Mister? Yo!

26:44.269 --> 26:45.930
-Nobody here.
-Good. We can go.

26:49.040 --> 26:51.873
-We're just gonna take him?
-We're gonna borrow him.

26:58.717 --> 26:59.877
What?

27:03.755 --> 27:04.744
Here he is.

27:04.856 --> 27:07.723
-What's he doing out here?
-I don't know.

27:08.059 --> 27:10.994
-What happened to his clothes?
-I don't know.

27:12.397 --> 27:14.228
They're getting him ready to bury him.

27:14.332 --> 27:17.267
-When they put him in a new suit.
-Sure.

27:18.169 --> 27:20.603
-You got clothes in the bag?
-I got clothes in the bag.

27:20.739 --> 27:23.674
-I got clothes for me, not for him.
-He's not my size.

27:23.775 --> 27:25.504
I won't touch him. They're my clothes.

27:25.610 --> 27:28.340
If I'm gonna put them on him,
you're gonna use your clothes.

27:28.446 --> 27:30.038
Now, stand back.

27:34.786 --> 27:38.688
Okay, here we go. We're almost set.
We're almost home, baby.

27:38.890 --> 27:42.986
Everything's all set. Except for
baby needs a new pair of shoes.

27:43.128 --> 27:46.291
I only have the ones I'm wearing.
You can forget about that.

27:47.132 --> 27:48.861
-Get those!
-Come on.

27:48.967 --> 27:51.367
I gotta hold him here.

27:54.372 --> 27:58.706
We're stealing shoes off a dead man.
We're going to hell.

28:12.290 --> 28:13.222
What?

28:13.324 --> 28:16.384
I'm going to have a heart attack now.
I'm going to sit down.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.189
It's just the morgue guy.

28:27.138 --> 28:31.802
-Come on, give me a hand.
-You're doing fine by yourself.

28:33.044 --> 28:34.238
Just fine.

28:37.382 --> 28:39.748
Come on, B, get in there!

28:44.923 --> 28:46.481
Piece of cake.

28:52.030 --> 28:54.430
Coast is clear. Get a taxi.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.668
-Taxi! I just have one question?
-What?

28:57.802 --> 29:00.464
-What will customs say?
-There's no customs, it's America.

29:00.572 --> 29:04.030
-JFK. To the airport.
-Get in.

29:05.143 --> 29:06.440
Taxi!

29:47.986 --> 29:49.146
We're here.

29:50.955 --> 29:53.446
I thought I did pretty well
for my first plane trip.

29:53.558 --> 29:55.082
You did very well.

29:55.226 --> 29:57.751
Did I tell you those little paper bags
would be handy?

29:57.896 --> 29:58.954
You did.

29:59.297 --> 30:04.030
Is this the bus to the hotel?
We got these bags.

30:04.135 --> 30:05.159
This guy, too.

30:05.637 --> 30:06.865
Come on, buddy.

30:06.971 --> 30:08.404
What have you got in here, a body?

30:08.540 --> 30:10.974
-Body? No! Why would we have--
-He's kidding.

30:11.109 --> 30:13.009
That's funny.
We don't have a body in there.

30:13.111 --> 30:14.601
We're on our way.

30:54.986 --> 30:56.715
I want to welcome you all to St. Thomas.

30:56.855 --> 31:00.552
If you look on the left there,
you'll see the botanical garden...

31:00.725 --> 31:02.590
...what used to be a sugar plantation.

31:06.130 --> 31:09.258
Thanks, buddy. Get the luggage, ok?

31:09.434 --> 31:12.631
-Welcome.
<i>-Aloha</i>

31:13.204 --> 31:16.640
-Nice and easy. Careful there.
-Sorry, sir.

31:17.508 --> 31:18.998
I'm home.

31:23.915 --> 31:25.849
Excuse me. Hi, Bernie Lomax.

31:25.950 --> 31:28.851
I'm with you for a few days.
I'll see you around.

31:31.022 --> 31:33.013
I just have this one case.

31:33.625 --> 31:34.819
Yeah. Got it.

31:35.526 --> 31:36.993
There are wheels on that.

31:42.066 --> 31:43.761
$600 a day?

31:43.902 --> 31:45.335
Hello, ladies.

31:45.436 --> 31:49.167
-Who's gonna cover this?
-That's the beauty part.

31:49.274 --> 31:53.643
Bernie's paying. Right, <i>amigo</i> ?
Look at this.

31:54.746 --> 31:58.546
-Someday they'll catch up to us.
-The operative word is, "someday."

31:58.650 --> 32:01.380
Give me the key. Johnny, is it?

32:01.486 --> 32:04.284
-That's heavy. Just give me that.
-Easy.

32:05.556 --> 32:06.523
We're home.

32:06.624 --> 32:10.617
-Watch it, there's a body in there!
-There's no body in there. He's kidding.

32:11.496 --> 32:13.521
-You got the other one?
-Yeah, yeah.

32:17.669 --> 32:21.332
Thank you very much,
that's all we'll be needing of you.

32:23.241 --> 32:25.402
Take $20 for yourself, put it on the room.

32:25.510 --> 32:28.638
-Thank you very much, Mr. Lomax.
-No, thank you.

32:36.421 --> 32:37.388
Fruit.

32:42.327 --> 32:44.227
Chips.

32:59.510 --> 33:02.411
-You got some deodorant?
-You smell fine.

33:02.880 --> 33:04.438
Thank you. It's not for me, though.

33:08.753 --> 33:10.118
Downwind!

33:10.421 --> 33:11.513
Thank you.

33:15.126 --> 33:16.991
We'll put him on ice.

33:17.061 --> 33:18.824
-In the fridge?
-Get him around the back.

33:18.930 --> 33:19.897
Yeah, I got him.

33:20.865 --> 33:23.561
-On three.
-Okay. All right.

33:23.701 --> 33:25.362
One, two, three.

33:31.776 --> 33:32.970
You got him?

33:37.215 --> 33:38.182
Get him in.

33:42.353 --> 33:43.320
Good job.

33:48.159 --> 33:49.683
Grapes.

34:04.308 --> 34:07.607
Is this place glorious, or what?
Come on out here.

34:07.845 --> 34:10.313
We're not here on vacation.
We've got work to do.

34:10.947 --> 34:14.076
The banks don't open until 10:00 tomorrow.
Come out. Take a look.

34:14.185 --> 34:16.516
There's things I gotta do
before we go to the bank.

34:18.255 --> 34:20.451
Oh, my God. Look at the tits on that one.

34:20.558 --> 34:24.688
What? Who?

34:25.129 --> 34:26.391
-Ladies.
-My God!

34:29.699 --> 34:30.962
Come on.

34:31.735 --> 34:33.033
I like this island.

34:33.304 --> 34:35.101
Is it great, or what?

34:40.678 --> 34:43.875
Very <i>simpatico</i>, in Bernie's case.
You know what I mean?

34:45.516 --> 34:48.246
-I'm gonna take a lap or two.
-Help yourself.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.817
Careful, you haven't swum in a while.

35:00.331 --> 35:02.128
Don't forget to breathe, buddy.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.468
-Hi, there.
-Hi.

35:40.571 --> 35:42.004
-How are you doing?
-Good.

35:42.106 --> 35:45.473
-Nice wind out there today.
-Yeah, not bad.

35:47.778 --> 35:51.111
-See me zip by you a few times?
-No, I didn't.

35:51.449 --> 35:55.442
Really? I was the one zooming along.
Wings up, flaps down. Whole nine yards.

35:55.753 --> 35:58.017
Wings up, flaps down. Yeah, right.

35:58.556 --> 35:59.648
Whatever.

36:03.461 --> 36:07.261
Nice to meet you.
So, are you staying here, Claudia?

36:07.365 --> 36:10.528
Actually, I work here.
But probably not for long if I don't hurry.

36:10.835 --> 36:13.998
So, come on,
do you want to have dinner with me?

36:15.106 --> 36:16.073
Sure.

36:17.041 --> 36:18.531
-You're kidding?
-No, I'm serious.

36:18.643 --> 36:20.008
-Really?
-Yeah.

36:20.111 --> 36:21.601
-You're surprised.
-No.

36:22.413 --> 36:25.075
-Yes, you are.
-Okay. What now? 7:00?

36:25.883 --> 36:28.078
55 Harmony Estate.
Can you remember that?

36:28.186 --> 36:30.279
Sure I can. 55 Harmony State.

36:30.621 --> 36:32.555
-Estate.
-Estate. Whatever, okay.

36:32.657 --> 36:34.488
-I'll see you then.
-Okay.

36:34.759 --> 36:36.351
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

37:09.160 --> 37:10.491
That is a special shirt.

37:10.628 --> 37:11.788
Do you like it?

37:11.929 --> 37:16.730
Really? You really like it? Good.
I got you one, too. Try it on.

37:16.834 --> 37:19.701
No, I'll just kind of leave it here
for a second.

37:20.037 --> 37:22.028
Give me your head for a second.

37:22.139 --> 37:23.572
-I'm a little worried.
-About what?

37:23.741 --> 37:26.005
The bank will want
to check Bernie's signature.

37:26.110 --> 37:27.441
Don't worry, I got it down cold.

37:27.545 --> 37:30.105
How do you think I paid for these gems?
Look at this.

37:30.214 --> 37:33.149
-That is nice stuff.
-Genuine gold fill.

37:33.851 --> 37:35.716
Very nice. I know you got it down cold.

37:35.820 --> 37:38.983
But they're probably going to want
to see Bernie sign his own name.

37:41.959 --> 37:42.948
That's a problem.

37:43.060 --> 37:45.221
It's a problem but don't worry,
I've got a plan.

37:45.329 --> 37:48.457
-You've got a plan?
-Good, 'cause I've got a plan, too.

37:48.599 --> 37:51.261
-Don't wait up.
-Be nice.

38:01.045 --> 38:04.412
-Come on. All you ever want to do is eat.
-Come on, I'm on vacation.

38:04.515 --> 38:07.609
-You're gonna turn into a chicken.
-I'm starving.

38:07.718 --> 38:10.812
-Why don't you eat the bones?
-I'll eat the fruit pretty soon.

38:10.921 --> 38:12.354
Eat the fruit. It's vitamin C.

38:21.399 --> 38:24.334
You know, you guys really live
in a nice <i>chapeau</i> here.

38:25.870 --> 38:29.431
Let me get that for you. I'll get it.
You got it.

38:30.474 --> 38:32.567
Thank you for a wonderful evening.

38:32.677 --> 38:36.044
No, thank you.
No, let me walk you to the door, please.

38:36.147 --> 38:37.580
No, it's really not necessary.

38:37.682 --> 38:41.675
I walk all my dates to the door. Let me
tell the taxi driver, I'll be one minute.

38:41.786 --> 38:44.949
Here's $20. When I'm halfway
up the steps, ping the pedal.

38:45.890 --> 38:49.291
-Was that a great meal, or what?
-Yeah, lovely.

38:49.427 --> 38:52.396
Bet you didn't know I spoke
so much French. <i>Parlez-vous?</i>

38:53.197 --> 38:56.360
-Too bad it was an Italian restaurant.
-Taxi, wait!

39:01.138 --> 39:02.400
He's gone.

39:07.278 --> 39:09.746
Guess I'll just walk home.

39:10.614 --> 39:14.141
No, just wait right here.
I'll get my keys and I'll drive you.

39:14.752 --> 39:16.242
Okay, I'll wait right here.

39:16.687 --> 39:18.177
I should have known.

40:55.252 --> 40:56.617
This is nice.

40:57.421 --> 40:58.888
You must be loaded.

41:01.091 --> 41:03.924
My buddy said he has one
just like this except it's black.

41:04.028 --> 41:06.496
-It hangs in his rear-view mirror.
-Don't touch this.

41:06.597 --> 41:09.259
-Why?
-It's my papa's. It's the voodoo.

41:09.867 --> 41:11.630
-Just the what?
-Voodoo.

41:11.836 --> 41:14.737
-Voodoo?
-Yeah. To cast spells and conjure tricks.

41:14.839 --> 41:16.204
Cast spells....

41:16.307 --> 41:19.401
-This is all voodoo stuff?
-Yeah, all this.

41:20.578 --> 41:21.909
How does it work?

41:23.547 --> 41:26.311
For instance, if I never wanted you
to come back here...

41:26.417 --> 41:29.978
...I'd simply take some salt and sprinkle it
over your feet like that.

41:32.456 --> 41:34.390
What happens
when you change your mind?

41:36.327 --> 41:39.455
-Are you interested in this at all?
-I'm very interested. I'm sorry.

41:40.898 --> 41:44.356
All right. To reverse a spell on someone
you have to find out who cast it.

41:44.502 --> 41:48.404
Once you unleash the power of the spell
it's placed back on the person who cast it.

41:48.639 --> 41:50.334
This is usually done by a mobu.

41:50.441 --> 41:53.342
-A what?
-A mobu. A priestess of black magic.

41:53.444 --> 41:55.969
Papa, he's a doctor,
and interested in the occult.

41:56.347 --> 41:59.282
He says she's very powerful.
He's done a lot of research.

42:00.184 --> 42:02.846
So, your daddy, he's a voodoo doctor?
I see.

42:03.954 --> 42:04.784
Out.

42:14.598 --> 42:17.567
-It's the last dance, come on.
-I'm waiting for the food.

42:17.701 --> 42:19.032
You won't be embarrassed.

42:19.136 --> 42:21.366
-I'm not gonna dance, I wanna eat!
-Forget you!

42:21.472 --> 42:23.167
Forget me? Brenda, sit down.

42:52.636 --> 42:53.660
Hang on.

42:54.572 --> 42:56.062
What are you doing?

44:31.669 --> 44:33.967
-Where are you going?
-To have a good time.

44:34.071 --> 44:37.234
-You're gonna have a good time with him?
-He's a great dancer.

44:37.341 --> 44:39.901
-You never want to do anything fun.
-I'm having fun.

44:40.044 --> 44:42.410
-Working out and eating, that's it.
-That's right.

44:42.513 --> 44:43.741
He's a great dancer, good-bye.

44:43.847 --> 44:46.816
He's a great dancer.
So what? I can bench-press a Buick.

44:47.351 --> 44:48.818
Brenda, get over here!

44:50.954 --> 44:52.512
Hey, wait up.

44:53.223 --> 44:55.714
I wanna talk. You're fun.

44:55.859 --> 44:58.191
-Can I walk with you?
-Get back here!

44:58.328 --> 45:01.092
-Don't pay any attention to him.
-You're not going anywhere.

45:01.198 --> 45:03.359
-Yeah? Who says so?
-I do!

45:04.568 --> 45:06.058
What are you doing?

45:06.837 --> 45:09.271
Stop it!
See, Arnold, he's not afraid of you!

45:10.541 --> 45:12.771
Why do you have to hit everybody?

45:12.976 --> 45:15.877
Who do you think you are?
You always have to beat everybody up.

45:21.785 --> 45:25.846
-What do you want? More?
-No, just leave him alone.

45:31.528 --> 45:34.463
Just cut it out, you big bully!
Get out of here!

45:34.598 --> 45:36.088
-You'll be sorry.
-Oh, yeah.

45:38.535 --> 45:42.471
Let me help you up. You poor baby.
He won't bother you anymore.

45:42.706 --> 45:46.267
There you go.
It's okay, let's walk together.

45:47.578 --> 45:49.375
You all right? I'll take care of you.

45:49.480 --> 45:52.449
I'm really sorry, you know?
He does that to everybody.

45:52.549 --> 45:56.952
But you're the bravest guy I've ever met.
I mean that, I really do.

45:59.623 --> 46:01.181
You're chilly.

46:09.299 --> 46:13.429
-Can I get one for the road there?
-Sorry, our cooler is locked up.

46:15.072 --> 46:16.562
Haven't you got a key?

46:17.307 --> 46:19.468
What's the damage, my new friend?

46:20.043 --> 46:21.567
-It's on the house.
-Really?

46:21.678 --> 46:25.478
-The last round's on me.
-Thanks, buddy. Here, this is for you.

46:27.050 --> 46:28.881
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

46:29.086 --> 46:30.053
I appreciate it.

46:30.154 --> 46:32.679
Have a good time. I did.

47:10.327 --> 47:11.487
It's 2:30 in the morning.

47:11.695 --> 47:12.787
What?

47:14.698 --> 47:16.461
-Good date?
-You're right.

47:16.733 --> 47:18.462
-What?
-Good time?

47:19.736 --> 47:21.363
It was great. Yeah.

47:21.505 --> 47:23.439
-Did you....
-You're in my bed.

47:23.707 --> 47:26.369
-Did you, you know?
-Yeah.

47:26.610 --> 47:30.876
-That little girl from the....
-Oh, yeah.

47:32.049 --> 47:33.846
-I set the alarm for--
-Good for you.

47:34.451 --> 47:36.442
-Turn off the light.
-Goodnight.

47:44.628 --> 47:47.188
So, what are we gonna do now?

47:48.198 --> 47:51.133
Don't be putting that on me,
I ain't got nothing to do with it.

47:51.235 --> 47:54.602
This is your fault,
you think of something for a change.

47:56.773 --> 47:57.933
Time's up.

47:58.709 --> 47:59.937
Can't think of anything.

48:00.043 --> 48:03.103
Yeah, right. Hey, wait a minute.
Hold tight. Wait a second.

48:03.213 --> 48:06.307
What do we got to be all afraid
of this Mobu woman for?

48:06.783 --> 48:09.684
I don't know, but doesn't she have
some kind of power over us?

48:09.820 --> 48:12.755
Man, hell, no!
She ain't got no power over us.

48:12.856 --> 48:15.950
Her name sounds
like some kind of damn car wax. Mobu!

48:16.827 --> 48:20.593
Look, from right now we are in control
of our own destiny.

48:21.098 --> 48:23.498
From this moment forth we do just
what we want...

48:23.600 --> 48:25.898
...and no one's gonna tell us--

48:36.313 --> 48:38.873
-You're starting to scare me.
-I can't help it.

48:40.484 --> 48:42.611
We'd better finish this game.

48:58.869 --> 49:01.303
Slow down. We've got plenty of time.

49:03.507 --> 49:06.442
I know, but I just wanna get this over with.

49:06.543 --> 49:09.376
Besides, we have a little shopping to do
before the....

49:09.479 --> 49:12.607
Excellent. Because I saw this hat
I wanna get. It's pretty cool.

49:12.716 --> 49:16.243
It's got this red band with a feather on it.
I thought I'd pick it up.

49:27.764 --> 49:28.890
Yeah?

49:31.034 --> 49:33.559
-What did you do with Bernie?
-He's in the fridge.

49:33.704 --> 49:34.671
No, he's not.

49:35.005 --> 49:38.964
Come on, I got a really bad headache
and I really don't.... He's not in the fridge?

49:39.076 --> 49:41.772
-This is not funny.
-All right, what did you do with him?

49:41.878 --> 49:44.176
-What did you do with him?
-I didn't do anything.

49:44.281 --> 49:46.909
You're so sick and repulsive.
Only you would think....

49:47.084 --> 49:50.542
That's not nice.
He probably just tumbled right on out.

49:50.654 --> 49:53.282
-I mean, did you open the door?
-No!

49:54.758 --> 49:56.692
-Housekeeping.
-Housekeeping?

49:56.827 --> 50:00.786
Don't you think if housekeeping found
a dead man we'd have heard about it?

50:00.931 --> 50:01.829
Good point.

50:01.999 --> 50:05.457
I was here all night. I left for a couple
of minutes to go conga dancing.

50:05.602 --> 50:09.368
-You went what?
-Conga dancing.

50:09.573 --> 50:11.234
You went conga dancing?

50:11.341 --> 50:14.105
But you were supposed to be here
guarding Bernie.

50:14.211 --> 50:18.409
Why would I have to guard a dead man
stuck in a two-foot refrigerator?

50:18.515 --> 50:21.040
Don't try and get out of it,
you were irresponsible.

50:21.151 --> 50:25.212
I was irresponsible? I was here all night
trying to find a way to get our jobs back!

50:25.322 --> 50:26.755
No, you were conga dancing!

50:26.857 --> 50:30.816
If you look up "irresponsibility," there's
a picture of your head lying next to it.

50:31.261 --> 50:32.285
That's not fair.

50:32.429 --> 50:35.455
Not fair? Why did I let you talk me into
coming on these schemes?

50:35.599 --> 50:38.090
We'll just go to jail for some crime
you didn't commit.

50:38.235 --> 50:41.398
We're going to jail anyway.
Once the credit card companies catch up.

50:41.505 --> 50:45.202
I was not the one who was out
conga dancing all night.

50:50.447 --> 50:54.907
Forgery. Fraud. Breaking and entering.

50:55.619 --> 51:00.249
Credit card scam. Robbery.
Accessory to murder.

51:01.091 --> 51:04.788
Kidnapping a dead man.
Losing a dead man.

51:13.837 --> 51:16.271
Just take it easy. Take it easy.

51:16.640 --> 51:18.403
-Is she dead, too?
-Don't be ridiculous.

51:18.508 --> 51:21.341
Maybe it's one of those
above-ground Caribbean cemeteries.

51:23.713 --> 51:25.237
-Hello.
-I'll handle this.

51:25.348 --> 51:28.545
-Please.
-Excuse me? Hey, wake up!

51:29.886 --> 51:32.354
-It's morning.
-Good morning.

51:32.522 --> 51:34.353
We were just sleeping.

51:35.058 --> 51:35.990
"We"?

51:36.126 --> 51:39.721
Yeah, me and.... I don't know his name.

51:39.830 --> 51:41.024
-Bernie.
-Bernie.

51:41.198 --> 51:44.656
That's cute. Wake up, come on.

51:44.801 --> 51:47.269
-It's morning.
-Excuse me, lady, miss?

51:47.704 --> 51:49.433
You were with Bernie last night?

51:49.539 --> 51:52.474
Yeah, he's kind of shy, isn't he?
He doesn't say a whole lot.

51:52.576 --> 51:54.100
No, he's very, very shy.

51:54.211 --> 51:58.272
By the way, just out of curiosity,
how did you happen to meet old Bern?

51:59.783 --> 52:00.977
In the conga line.

52:02.853 --> 52:06.619
Am I the only one alive
who was not in the conga line?

52:06.756 --> 52:08.986
-Bernie was conga dancing last night?
-Yeah.

52:09.226 --> 52:12.457
He's very graceful. And brave.

52:12.729 --> 52:14.162
He's a wonderful listener.

52:15.165 --> 52:18.191
He's so great.
He didn't even try to come on to me.

52:18.335 --> 52:21.065
-No way!
-There are some nice guys in this--

52:21.171 --> 52:23.002
-It's his feminine side.
-I'll wake him up.

52:23.106 --> 52:25.506
He's grumpy in the morning,
you don't wanna deal with that.

52:25.609 --> 52:28.908
-Is he gonna be all right?
-He's gonna be fine. Don't you worry.

52:29.212 --> 52:31.510
Tell him that Brenda said good-bye.

52:31.615 --> 52:33.606
We'll do that. You have a nice lunch.

52:33.717 --> 52:36.515
Conga line? You didn't happen to see him
in the conga line?

52:36.620 --> 52:37.587
No, I didn't.

52:37.687 --> 52:38.881
What's going on here?

52:38.989 --> 52:40.923
I suppose he was in a different conga line.

52:41.024 --> 52:42.821
No! It's like Ripley's here.

52:48.465 --> 52:50.228
<i>All right, here we go</i>

52:50.500 --> 52:53.162
-I'll get the bag.
-All right, I'll get the car.

52:54.104 --> 52:55.765
You understand what we're gonna say?

52:55.872 --> 52:58.170
We got our story all straight
and everything?

52:58.275 --> 52:59.537
We lost him.

53:05.849 --> 53:08.841
It's not fair.
I don't understand why I can't drive.

53:08.952 --> 53:10.078
You don't have a license.

53:10.187 --> 53:12.485
I've got Bernie's license.
How hard can this be?

53:12.589 --> 53:14.750
You just drive on the right.
It's not a big deal.

53:14.858 --> 53:19.488
-On this island they drive on the left.
-Really? You drive.

53:51.361 --> 53:52.385
-There's the bank.
-Where?

53:52.529 --> 53:54.292
-Find me a parking spot.
-Good, park.

53:54.397 --> 53:56.262
-Just right there.
-I can't park there.

54:05.609 --> 54:07.702
That's what we need right there.

54:13.250 --> 54:14.217
Be back in five.

54:17.887 --> 54:20.447
-Do you mind?
-I'm using it.

54:21.057 --> 54:22.217
For what?

54:37.807 --> 54:39.775
-This isn't the hat shop.
-Over here.

54:39.876 --> 54:44.040
-It's not.
-Come here. See this? Take a look.

54:49.552 --> 54:51.076
Come on, baby.

54:52.956 --> 54:54.890
-Stick your hand through this thing.
-What?

54:54.991 --> 54:57.619
Just put your left hand through. That's it.

54:59.429 --> 55:01.659
-Check it out.
-How did he get here?

55:01.798 --> 55:04.062
I don't know. Got to be the Mobu, man.

55:04.200 --> 55:07.101
Ask no questions, tell no consequences.

55:07.470 --> 55:08.402
Be cool.

55:09.706 --> 55:11.173
What am I doing, Richard?

55:12.676 --> 55:14.268
All the way in. There.

55:14.744 --> 55:16.268
Let's get him in the back.

55:26.823 --> 55:28.723
Two guys, they're taking Bernie.

55:29.426 --> 55:33.385
How do you like that? What kind of idiots
would steal a dead body?

55:34.898 --> 55:36.058
We did!

55:42.806 --> 55:44.774
Excuse me.
Where do you think you're going?

55:44.874 --> 55:47.707
-Let go of me!
-You can't leave without paying!

55:50.347 --> 55:51.575
Come back here!

56:08.365 --> 56:11.801
-Do you have the time?
-Get out of the way!

56:19.943 --> 56:21.911
Get your hands off me!

56:51.207 --> 56:53.107
Ready. One, two, three.

56:54.577 --> 56:55.635
Giddyup.

56:56.913 --> 56:59.381
I think the toothache idea was very good.

57:08.792 --> 57:10.316
Sign the card, please, Mr. Lomax.

57:11.327 --> 57:14.421
What was that?
Yeah, go right ahead. Sure.

57:20.804 --> 57:23.466
-And now the key, please.
-You have the key, don't you?

57:25.942 --> 57:30.140
Thank you. I'll just go to the vault
and get your safety deposit box.

57:34.918 --> 57:37.250
-It's working.
-Like falling off a log.

57:54.337 --> 57:57.033
Will you be needing anything else,
Mr. Lomax?

57:58.208 --> 57:59.675
I hope that tooth gets better.

58:02.111 --> 58:03.942
Would you look at the size of it?

58:04.047 --> 58:06.515
It's got to hold $2 million.
You open her up.

58:30.073 --> 58:31.404
All right, let's get him out.

58:32.342 --> 58:36.506
Where'd he go? How the hell could he fall
out of the car? This is ridiculous.

58:37.046 --> 58:40.174
Look at that island mama. She is fine.

58:45.955 --> 58:48.185
You're starting to freak me out, man.

58:51.461 --> 58:53.088
Baby, where you going?

59:03.139 --> 59:07.235
It's obviously a map.
All we've got to do is figure it out.

59:07.911 --> 59:11.472
Look, I don't know what any of those
things are and neither do you.

59:11.581 --> 59:14.675
Let's have lunch and some
of those conch fritters you like.

59:14.784 --> 59:15.512
Don't worry.

59:20.790 --> 59:22.985
Isn't that the girl from last night?

59:23.560 --> 59:25.687
Are you enjoying your visit?

59:26.930 --> 59:29.262
-Let's ask her about the map.
-No.

59:29.399 --> 59:30.661
Come on.

59:32.869 --> 59:34.461
Excuse me? Hi. I hate to bug you.

59:34.604 --> 59:37.698
My name is Richard.
I'm a good friend of Larry's.

59:41.177 --> 59:43.543
-That guy.
-I'm surprised he has any friends.

59:43.646 --> 59:46.615
You do know him.
Anyway, we found this map.

59:46.916 --> 59:50.317
We have no idea what it means.
Does it make any sense to you?

59:51.521 --> 59:54.684
No, it doesn't,
but these are definitely voodoo symbols.

59:54.791 --> 59:56.691
Voodoo, hoodoo. I told you.

59:59.228 --> 01:00:03.631
-You friend doesn't believe in the occult.
-I have enough trouble with Catholicism.

01:00:04.167 --> 01:00:05.099
Do you?

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:09.170
Yeah, I believe.
If it helps me figure out this map, I believe.

01:00:09.706 --> 01:00:10.968
Could you help us?

01:00:11.074 --> 01:00:14.441
I can't, but my father's very interested
in black magic. I could ask--

01:00:14.544 --> 01:00:16.409
Could you ask him? It's awful important.

01:00:16.512 --> 01:00:18.503
Sure. Actually I'm on break right now...

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:20.913
...so I can see if I can catch him
at the hospital.

01:00:22.185 --> 01:00:24.119
We should meet in an hour in the lobby.

01:00:24.253 --> 01:00:26.414
-Whenever you like. An hour is great.
-Great.

01:01:16.606 --> 01:01:19.074
Look at that. I think that's their car.

01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:23.271
What are you talking about, man?
First of all that ain't no car, it's a jeep.

01:01:23.546 --> 01:01:26.174
There's a thousand of them on the island.

01:01:45.601 --> 01:01:49.332
-What? I don't have any money.
-Be cool. Just be cool.

01:01:49.806 --> 01:01:51.967
-How you doing?
-Fine, thank you, how are you?

01:01:52.308 --> 01:01:55.209
-Where's the dead man at?
-He's in the jeep. You can have him.

01:01:55.311 --> 01:02:00.010
-No, he is not in the jeep. Where is he?
-What do you mean he's not in the jeep?

01:02:00.116 --> 01:02:02.084
He's right out there in the red jeep.

01:02:02.618 --> 01:02:05.678
-You're kidding? He's not there?
-What will we do with these two?

01:02:06.055 --> 01:02:10.048
We gonna take them to the Mobu,
let them explain to her.

01:02:10.159 --> 01:02:11.592
That way she's gonna understand...

01:02:11.661 --> 01:02:15.062
...that we're gonna be cool
and they're gonna be exactly where we is!

01:02:15.198 --> 01:02:17.257
-Then we can blame them.
-We're gonna try.

01:02:18.167 --> 01:02:20.499
-How would you fellas like a margarita?
-On me!

01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:33.939
-You lost them?
-Not exactly. Anybody could have.

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:38.050
Twice. He was going to lead you
to the money.

01:02:38.521 --> 01:02:41.684
We messed with the bones
and that fooled with the conjuring...

01:02:41.824 --> 01:02:44.850
...and now he can only walk
when the music's playing. Sorry.

01:02:46.729 --> 01:02:48.060
Where is he now?

01:02:49.265 --> 01:02:50.755
The white boys.

01:02:54.537 --> 01:02:57.700
-We don't know where he is.
-We left him in the jeep, dead, deceased.

01:02:57.807 --> 01:03:00.537
But ask them what they were doing
at the bank with Bernie.

01:03:02.678 --> 01:03:05.374
We needed him to get
into the safety deposit box.

01:03:06.682 --> 01:03:08.877
-What was in the box?
-A map.

01:03:09.152 --> 01:03:10.847
-Give me the map.
-We don't have it.

01:03:11.053 --> 01:03:12.543
-We don't have the map.
-No map.

01:03:12.655 --> 01:03:14.589
-Kill them!
-No! Wait a minute!

01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:16.850
-He lost it, he lost it!
-Please.

01:03:17.026 --> 01:03:19.426
If you kill them, we both lose.

01:03:20.496 --> 01:03:22.157
I have another way.

01:03:41.384 --> 01:03:44.911
-Drink.
-I'd love to. You see, I just had lunch.

01:03:45.521 --> 01:03:47.785
But there's always room for Jell-O.

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:56.359
A powerful conjure...

01:03:58.334 --> 01:04:00.700
...unless you have the antidote
by night, you die.

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:04.162
Bring me the map, you live.

01:04:19.188 --> 01:04:20.746
-What?
-Get out!

01:04:20.923 --> 01:04:22.550
You only got to tell me once!

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.793
Thank you very much.

01:04:27.463 --> 01:04:30.261
-Drive safe, now.
-You all have a nice day.

01:04:33.102 --> 01:04:34.330
Bye-bye.

01:04:35.638 --> 01:04:37.503
-Don't get depressed.
-Jerks.

01:04:37.607 --> 01:04:39.973
Don't get depressed.
You still got hours to live.

01:04:40.076 --> 01:04:41.907
The sun doesn't go down for ages.

01:04:42.078 --> 01:04:45.536
Good thing it's not winter. The sun
would be down by now. You'd be dead.

01:04:45.648 --> 01:04:46.808
Thanks, that cheers me up.

01:04:49.685 --> 01:04:52.984
-How do I look to you? I don't feel good.
-You're just a little slow.

01:04:53.089 --> 01:04:55.887
You need an aerobic workout.
Get those endorphins kicking in.

01:04:56.525 --> 01:04:58.789
-Guys!
-Our troubles are over!

01:05:03.132 --> 01:05:04.099
Hi.

01:05:04.901 --> 01:05:06.368
Honey, have you got the map?

01:05:06.502 --> 01:05:09.733
No, I left it with my father.
He's gonna look at it after surgery.

01:05:10.072 --> 01:05:11.061
Where have you been?

01:05:11.173 --> 01:05:13.368
We were kidnapped,
taken up to that Mobu chick.

01:05:13.476 --> 01:05:14.602
You saw the Mobu?

01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:16.769
She put a spell on Richie,
says he's gonna die.

01:05:16.879 --> 01:05:18.972
-She put a spell on Richie?
-We need the map.

01:05:19.081 --> 01:05:23.177
Okay. Maybe we can catch my father
before he leaves the hospital.

01:05:23.286 --> 01:05:27.484
Come on, buddy. You're gonna make it.
I know. It's a beauty, isn't it?

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.862
-You said I could drive.
-Okay, here's your chance.

01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:43.329
-Relax. Let me do my job.
-Please.

01:05:43.439 --> 01:05:45.134
-Hold on.
-Which one do I push?

01:05:55.818 --> 01:05:58.787
-Okay, we're ready.
-One minute!

01:05:59.021 --> 01:05:59.851
Go!

01:06:28.451 --> 01:06:31.113
-Are these yours?
-You pervert!

01:06:31.253 --> 01:06:34.222
-Don't move! You're under arrest.
-No, Officer, I don't....

01:07:17.533 --> 01:07:19.433
Parasailing? Bernie was parasailing?

01:07:19.535 --> 01:07:23.301
-Who is that?
-He's our boss. He's dead, don't worry.

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.174
-He's moving?
-I see that.

01:07:26.308 --> 01:07:28.868
Look at him go, he's like a bug!

01:07:30.946 --> 01:07:33.642
He's moving. How's he doing it?
He's standing up!

01:07:33.783 --> 01:07:36.581
Look at that son of a bitch.

01:07:37.319 --> 01:07:39.219
How is he moving?

01:07:40.289 --> 01:07:42.587
Those guys said he'd move
when music is playing.

01:07:42.691 --> 01:07:43.453
Yeah.

01:07:43.559 --> 01:07:45.151
There's music playing.

01:07:47.196 --> 01:07:49.687
Would somebody please explain to me
what's going on?

01:07:50.933 --> 01:07:53.401
He'll lead us to the money.
We've got to follow him.

01:07:53.536 --> 01:07:54.560
What do you mean, "he's dead"?

01:07:54.703 --> 01:07:57.331
He's a zombie. Don't worry about it,
we'll explain later!

01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:58.964
Come on, Richard!

01:08:00.076 --> 01:08:01.634
He's going in the water.

01:08:01.977 --> 01:08:03.467
That's where the money is.

01:08:08.951 --> 01:08:10.475
-What?
-He stopped.

01:08:14.890 --> 01:08:16.413
What's the matter with him?

01:08:20.129 --> 01:08:22.359
He can't hear the music under the water.

01:08:26.167 --> 01:08:27.362
Idea!

01:08:53.429 --> 01:08:55.988
His death certificate.
From the New York authorities.

01:08:56.499 --> 01:08:58.433
You must have been mistaken.

01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:00.761
I'd get some rest, if I were you.

01:09:04.106 --> 01:09:06.734
Perhaps you're right.
I haven't been sleeping well.

01:09:06.876 --> 01:09:11.779
Things have been going badly at work.
I'm feeling some pressure.

01:09:12.781 --> 01:09:15.180
Forget about work for a while
and try and relax.

01:09:15.518 --> 01:09:18.544
If you don't,
you're gonna get a nervous breakdown.

01:09:19.787 --> 01:09:20.755
Yes.

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:23.716
May I see the fax?

01:09:37.206 --> 01:09:39.071
Look around you.

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:42.500
It's paradise.

01:09:48.984 --> 01:09:50.451
Enjoy your visit to the island.

01:09:50.553 --> 01:09:54.785
You've seen the last of me.
And I've seen the last of him.

01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:03.428
-I got it.
-One, two, three.

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:07.135
-Okay, put these on him, baby.
-Okay.

01:10:07.703 --> 01:10:12.834
Okay. Headphones go on the head,
thingamabob goes on the belt.

01:10:14.109 --> 01:10:16.043
-He's on. Do something.
-Should be working.

01:10:16.145 --> 01:10:20.138
-There he goes.
-He's moving.

01:10:21.617 --> 01:10:24.848
Swim with the fishes, you ugly bastard.

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.018
Here he goes.

01:10:32.528 --> 01:10:34.291
You know,
for a dead man he's very buoyant.

01:10:34.463 --> 01:10:37.159
He's doing good. He's doing good. Go, B.

01:10:42.605 --> 01:10:45.506
<i>Welcome to our Atlantis submarine tour</i>

01:10:45.608 --> 01:10:51.046
<i>Our dive site is located about five miles</i>
<i>outside the harbor of Charlotte Amalie</i>

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:56.110
Now, as we continue to move out
further over the coral reef...

01:10:56.218 --> 01:10:59.779
...you'll find more and more
unusual kinds of undersea life...

01:10:59.888 --> 01:11:01.378
...here at fifty feet.

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:36.880
If you look to port side, I believe
that's the left side for you landlubbers...

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:41.255
...you'll see some of the most beautiful
coral formations in the world.

01:11:44.667 --> 01:11:47.966
Everybody see that? Isn't that beautiful?

01:11:53.509 --> 01:11:56.672
Excuse me. Would you stop the sub?
I wanna get out!

01:11:57.012 --> 01:12:00.038
Get serious.
Now we're fifty feet underwater.

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:02.174
I don't care.
I just saw a dead man I know...

01:12:02.284 --> 01:12:04.149
...walking in the ocean. I'm getting off!

01:12:04.253 --> 01:12:07.279
-That's impossible!
-I'm commandeering this ship.

01:12:07.489 --> 01:12:09.081
No, you're not!

01:13:15.691 --> 01:13:17.181
<i>What's he doing?</i>

01:13:46.722 --> 01:13:48.690
<i>I wonder what's in there?</i>

01:14:44.146 --> 01:14:46.842
-It worked.
-We lived.

01:14:50.419 --> 01:14:54.185
Let's go on in. Way to go, Beester.

01:14:59.828 --> 01:15:03.229
I don't know. He went crazy
down there! He kept trying to open--

01:15:03.365 --> 01:15:05.890
I'm not crazy! Lomax is down there!
I can....

01:15:07.002 --> 01:15:08.060
Doc!

01:15:09.238 --> 01:15:10.728
Good stuff.

01:15:11.773 --> 01:15:14.333
-That ought to hold him for a while.
-What happened?

01:15:14.443 --> 01:15:17.469
Maybe he has claustrophobia.
The sub might have set it off.

01:15:17.579 --> 01:15:19.240
That's it. I'm gonna deport this guy.

01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:20.872
-Are you?
-Yeah.

01:15:20.983 --> 01:15:24.419
Doc, maybe you better come along with us.
This guy is nuts!

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:25.987
You've got that right.

01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:30.057
Doc, come on in here.

01:15:32.027 --> 01:15:34.257
-Got your bag?
-Yes, I got the bag.

01:15:43.805 --> 01:15:45.898
All right. Come on.

01:16:00.856 --> 01:16:04.155
He still won't let go. How we gonna get
the money to the Mobu?

01:16:06.795 --> 01:16:07.853
I don't know.

01:16:10.766 --> 01:16:12.700
-Maybe I can catch that cart.
-Yeah.

01:16:12.801 --> 01:16:16.134
-Good idea. You okay?
-Never been better.

01:16:18.006 --> 01:16:22.739
Breathe! Richard, you spit on me!

01:16:23.211 --> 01:16:25.702
-I feel so much better now.
-Come on, get up.

01:16:26.081 --> 01:16:28.106
Wait for me! Help! Wait!

01:16:28.617 --> 01:16:29.743
Excuse me!

01:16:30.552 --> 01:16:32.850
My friend is really sick. He's in big trouble.

01:16:32.955 --> 01:16:36.356
We just need a ride. Can you please wait?
We'll only be one minute.

01:16:36.725 --> 01:16:37.783
-Bring him up.
-Thank you.

01:16:38.126 --> 01:16:39.889
-How you feeling?
-Better than he is.

01:16:40.028 --> 01:16:41.859
Yeah, grab that arrow thing, honey.

01:16:44.399 --> 01:16:47.698
Okay. Wait, no. Come on. This way.

01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:54.668
Excuse me,
could you folks scoot over a little bit?

01:16:54.776 --> 01:16:55.834
We had a fishing accident.

01:16:56.979 --> 01:17:00.142
Come on, horse, giddyup here!
They've got a dead man.

01:17:01.116 --> 01:17:03.812
What are they afraid of?
I mean, it's just a Beester.

01:17:03.919 --> 01:17:06.149
Now what are we gonna do?

01:17:08.190 --> 01:17:10.249
Okay, this is the beauty part.

01:17:19.568 --> 01:17:20.933
It's working.

01:17:23.338 --> 01:17:24.862
Come on, Beester.

01:17:30.345 --> 01:17:34.441
I told you, we're gonna make it.
You're gonna be fine.

01:17:45.627 --> 01:17:46.821
How do you feel?

01:17:46.928 --> 01:17:50.159
Can you hurry it up?
I'm sinking faster than the sun.

01:17:58.073 --> 01:17:59.973
Am I a genius, or what?

01:18:00.676 --> 01:18:04.203
-I really don't feel so good.
-It's okay, we're almost there.

01:18:04.813 --> 01:18:07.680
-I'm losing my hair?
-No, you're not losing your hair.

01:18:07.783 --> 01:18:08.841
We're almost there.

01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:11.214
-We got to go see the Mobu.
-Are we almost there?

01:18:14.656 --> 01:18:16.351
Just around the bend.

01:18:17.726 --> 01:18:20.194
-We got a hill here.
-Stop the music! Stop the music!

01:18:20.429 --> 01:18:25.264
Got it. We're okay.
We're okay. We're not okay.

01:18:25.367 --> 01:18:26.629
We're not okay.

01:18:28.670 --> 01:18:31.036
-Slow it down!
-Don't breathe!

01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:36.374
-Do something!
-I'm....

01:18:40.649 --> 01:18:43.641
Doc, I told you, look at him,
he's running down the road.

01:18:45.053 --> 01:18:46.077
Bail out!

01:18:52.427 --> 01:18:53.359
Slow down!

01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:16.544
We're not gonna make it!

01:19:21.289 --> 01:19:22.916
-Pretty bird.
-What....

01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:27.291
Everybody, duck!

01:19:32.234 --> 01:19:33.792
We're going in the woods!

01:19:40.509 --> 01:19:41.441
Look!

01:19:43.211 --> 01:19:46.044
-It's the Mobu chick.
-It's the Mobu, you're gonna live.

01:19:47.749 --> 01:19:49.512
Watch out for that branch.

01:19:52.721 --> 01:19:53.688
Money!

01:19:55.991 --> 01:19:57.117
The money!

01:20:07.235 --> 01:20:09.260
Freeze! All right, hold it right there!

01:20:09.671 --> 01:20:10.603
Papa?

01:20:10.705 --> 01:20:12.172
-Am I dead yet?
-No, you're okay.

01:20:12.407 --> 01:20:14.170
Come on,
put your hands behind your back!

01:20:19.614 --> 01:20:20.581
What?

01:20:20.849 --> 01:20:24.808
-I knew you stole the $2 million.
-What are you doing here? Are you okay?

01:20:25.387 --> 01:20:26.718
-I got it.
-Now give it to me.

01:20:26.822 --> 01:20:27.846
I got it right here.

01:20:27.956 --> 01:20:31.323
The whole $2 million. It's all here!
For you, buddy!

01:20:31.426 --> 01:20:33.519
I got all of it. Don't you worry!

01:20:33.628 --> 01:20:35.095
-What?
-Thanks.

01:20:35.197 --> 01:20:36.721
You're welcome!

01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:40.561
Mobu lady, we held up our end.

01:20:40.702 --> 01:20:43.000
We got the money, give him his life back.
Hurry up!

01:20:43.104 --> 01:20:45.163
What are you doing?
What's the matter with her?

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:48.199
-She suffered a concussion.
-So what?

01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:49.800
She'll be out for hours.

01:20:49.978 --> 01:20:52.469
Just dig a hole and throw dirt on me.

01:20:57.352 --> 01:21:00.913
-It's my fault. You'll die because of me.
-No, it's not your fault.

01:21:01.022 --> 01:21:03.513
-It's all my fault.
-No, it's not.

01:21:06.528 --> 01:21:09.258
Didn't you say something
about reversing the conjure...

01:21:09.397 --> 01:21:11.592
...back from the person it's on...

01:21:11.733 --> 01:21:13.530
...so it's not on them anymore...

01:21:13.635 --> 01:21:15.159
...but back on the original person?

01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:18.865
It's possible, but you have to
believe in the magic in order for it to work.

01:21:19.674 --> 01:21:21.767
-Like Tinkerbell, right?
-Stop joking!

01:21:22.010 --> 01:21:24.638
I ain't joking.
Look at him, he's dying. I believe.

01:21:24.746 --> 01:21:26.213
I believe.

01:21:27.415 --> 01:21:30.213
You can do that, I've seen you do
something like that before.

01:21:32.354 --> 01:21:33.446
There is one way.

01:21:37.225 --> 01:21:38.783
But I need the blood of a virgin.

01:21:42.898 --> 01:21:45.366
Good-bye. I'm dead.

01:21:56.044 --> 01:21:58.274
-You?
-Just take the blood, Doc.

01:22:23.471 --> 01:22:26.235
I like this shirt.
I was wrong. You've got good taste.

01:22:26.341 --> 01:22:27.273
Thanks, buddy.

01:22:27.409 --> 01:22:29.104
-Thank you.
-For what?

01:22:29.577 --> 01:22:33.172
You know,
for keeping yourself a virgin for me.

01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:35.810
That's nice, that's really nice.

01:22:35.917 --> 01:22:38.977
Just twist the knife a little deeper,
why don't you?

01:22:39.387 --> 01:22:41.787
-Can we talk about something else, please?
-Sure.

01:22:41.923 --> 01:22:43.356
I'll tell you what.

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:48.790
Why don't you just forget about
ever going back to New York City.

01:22:51.032 --> 01:22:52.590
Where did you get this money?

01:22:53.268 --> 01:22:56.260
You know, the $2 million that Hummel
was looking for that Bern stole?

01:22:56.404 --> 01:22:58.372
-Yeah?
-It was $3 million.

01:22:58.473 --> 01:23:00.275
You have $1 million in here?

01:23:00.275 --> 01:23:04.769
We do, except for about $8,000
I had to pay off on Bernie's credit cards...

01:23:04.879 --> 01:23:07.074
...you know, all that stuff you charged?

01:23:07.549 --> 01:23:09.517
-We can't keep this money, can we?
-Why not?

01:23:09.784 --> 01:23:12.685
-We don't know who it belongs to.
-That's the beauty part.

01:23:12.887 --> 01:23:14.445
It doesn't belong to anybody.

01:23:14.556 --> 01:23:17.684
It was there to be claimed
and so Larry claimed it.

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:21.523
I'm sorry, I can't.
I just can't do it. It's not right.

01:23:21.963 --> 01:23:24.659
I'm sorry. I don't feel good about it.

01:23:25.734 --> 01:23:27.258
-I understand.
-You do?

01:23:27.369 --> 01:23:29.860
-Sorry.
-That's all right.

01:23:31.172 --> 01:23:36.701
By the way,
did I neglect to introduce you to the crew?

01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:45.047
-What are we waiting for?
-Hoist up the anchor, let's go.

01:23:45.153 --> 01:23:47.485
How does Monte Carlo sound to you
this time of year?

01:23:47.589 --> 01:23:49.784
-Lovely.
-Monte Carlo, ladies.

01:23:57.332 --> 01:23:58.299
To us.

01:24:08.043 --> 01:24:10.978
Ain't this a bitch?
Where the hell is he taking us?

01:24:11.079 --> 01:24:12.273
I don't know.

01:24:12.614 --> 01:24:14.673
At least we got to see the carnival.

01:24:14.816 --> 01:24:17.250
Yeah, I didn't think
we were gonna be the carnival.
