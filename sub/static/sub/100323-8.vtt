WEBVTT

00:02.711 --> 00:04.921
GET OUT OF HERE!

00:05.004 --> 00:06.423
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:06.506 --> 00:09.759
IDIOT ASKED IF HE COULD
PAY WITH A ROLL OF STAMPS.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.511
STAMPS? LIKE FROM
THE POST OFFICE?

00:11.594 --> 00:14.055
HELL, YEAH,
FROM THE POST OFFICE.

00:14.139 --> 00:16.933
THEY WERE STILL IN THAT
LITTLE DUMB, CRINKLY PACKAGE.

00:17.016 --> 00:18.476
WERE THEY AT LEAST
FOREVER STAMPS?

00:18.560 --> 00:22.313
THEY WAS SOME STICK-IT-WHERE-
THE-SUN-DON'T-SHINE STAMPS.

00:22.397 --> 00:25.692
I TOLD HIM, HOW AM
I SUPPOSED TO PUT FOOD ON
THE TABLE WITH THAT?

00:25.775 --> 00:27.902
WOMAN:
I'LL FIND SOMEBODY ELSE.

00:27.986 --> 00:30.905
MAN, VOICE-OVER:
MOST PEOPLE IN LIFE
DESERVE BETTER THAN THEY GOT.

00:30.989 --> 00:32.907
THAT'S A PLAIN AND SIMPLE FACT.

00:32.991 --> 00:34.909
BUT I TRULY BELIEVE
THINGS CAN GET BETTER

00:34.993 --> 00:37.495
IF YOU ONLY WISH IT HARD ENOUGH.

00:37.579 --> 00:40.999
AND THAT WAY, I GUESS
YOU COULD SAY I'M AN OPTIMIST.

00:48.214 --> 00:51.301
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR
LEG, SWEETIE?

00:51.384 --> 00:52.886
I TORE A LIGAMENT.

00:52.969 --> 00:54.512
WANT ME TO HELP
MAKE IT BETTER?

00:54.596 --> 00:58.808
50 BUCKS. EXTRAS,
THE PRICE GOES UP.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.144
CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION FIRST?

01:01.227 --> 01:02.604
PERSONAL QUESTION?

01:02.687 --> 01:05.315
SURE, HONEY.
FIRE AWAY.

01:05.398 --> 01:08.151
IF I WERE TO GIVE YOU
A CHANCE TO GET AWAY
FROM ALL OF THIS,

01:08.234 --> 01:11.946
FRESH START,
WOULD YOU COME WITH ME?

01:12.030 --> 01:14.032
YOU'D--YOU'D
REALLY DO THAT?

01:14.115 --> 01:16.075
I ABSOLUTELY WOULD.

01:16.159 --> 01:17.827
BUT WHY?
LOOK AT ME.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.538
I'M JUST A--

01:17.911 --> 01:20.538
I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.040
DOESN'T MATTER.

01:28.087 --> 01:29.964
COME AWAY WITH YOU?

01:30.048 --> 01:32.008
I DON'T NEED TO BE
REFORMED, HON.

01:32.091 --> 01:34.052
I JUST NEED
THE 50 BUCKS.

01:42.727 --> 01:45.563
MAN, VOICE-OVER: BUT ALL
THE OPTIMISM IN THE WORLD
DOESN'T MEAN A THING

01:45.647 --> 01:48.066
IF PEOPLE AREN'T READY
TO HELP THEMSELVES.

01:51.653 --> 01:54.989
I KNOW WHAT I DO
IS WRONG, BUT...

01:55.073 --> 01:58.076
THERE'S NOT ALWAYS A GOOD CHOICE
TO BE MADE IN LIFE.

02:01.120 --> 02:05.917
SOMETIMES, YOU NEED TO PICK
THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS.

02:11.464 --> 02:13.258
EACH TIME I DO THIS,

02:13.341 --> 02:16.594
I CAN FEEL SOMETHING
DIE INSIDE OF ME.

02:16.678 --> 02:21.015
IT'S AWFUL. I DON'T THINK YOU
APPRECIATE HOW AWFUL IT IS.

02:21.099 --> 02:22.892
AND WHAT SCARES ME THE MOST IS

02:22.976 --> 02:25.395
I'M GOING TO TURN INTO
SOMETHING EVIL, TOO,

02:25.478 --> 02:27.772
BIT BY BIT, GRADUAL,

02:27.856 --> 02:30.024
SO SLOWLY,
I WON'T EVEN NOTICE

02:30.108 --> 02:34.696
UNTIL ONE DAY, SUDDENLY,
THAT'S ALL I AM...

02:34.779 --> 02:36.739
PURE EVIL.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.116
NOTHING ELSE.

02:38.199 --> 02:40.660
PRENTISS: I--I HARDLY KNOW
WHAT TO SAY, SIR.

02:40.743 --> 02:43.663
WELL, WE HOPE
YOU'LL SAY YES.

02:43.746 --> 02:45.790
I DON'T NEED
AN ANSWER TODAY.

02:45.874 --> 02:49.043
OUR TRANSITION TIMELINE
IS STILL SEVERAL MONTHS
DOWN THE ROAD.

02:49.127 --> 02:52.046
I JUST WANTED TO
MAKE YOU AWARE FOR NOW.

02:52.130 --> 02:55.049
YOU'VE GOT THAT DEER-IN-
THE-HEADLIGHTS LOOK,
AGENT PRENTISS.

02:55.133 --> 02:59.554
IT'S JUST--
IT'S A LOT TO CONSIDER...

02:59.637 --> 03:01.890
DIRECTOR OF THE FBI.

03:01.973 --> 03:03.558
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA
SUGARCOAT IT.

03:03.641 --> 03:05.059
IT'S A POLITICAL
POSITION

03:05.143 --> 03:07.645
AND THE VETTING PROCESS
CAN BE GRUELING,

03:07.729 --> 03:09.647
BUT YOU WOULDN'T BE
ON THE SHORT LIST

03:09.731 --> 03:11.065
IF WE DIDN'T THINK
YOU COULD HANDLE IT.

03:11.149 --> 03:12.692
I'M HONORED, SIR.

03:12.775 --> 03:15.236
AND IF I CAN OFFER
A PERSONAL ASIDE,

03:15.320 --> 03:17.697
AFTER 100-PLUS YEARS,
I THINK IT'S HIGH TIME

03:17.780 --> 03:19.616
THE BUREAU HAD A FEMALE
AT THE HELM.

03:19.699 --> 03:21.659
AH...

03:21.743 --> 03:24.078
THINK ABOUT IT.

03:24.162 --> 03:26.706
NOW, UNTIL I HAVE
AN ANSWER,

03:26.789 --> 03:29.125
I'M GONNA HAVE TO ASK
THAT THIS REMAINS
CONFIDENTIAL.

03:29.208 --> 03:31.628
OF COURSE.
THANK YOU, SIR.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.212
RIGHT.

03:37.175 --> 03:39.969
GARCIA: SPILL,
WHY DON'T YOU?
HOW WAS NEW ORLEANS?

03:40.053 --> 03:41.763
OH, IT WAS WONDERFUL.

03:41.846 --> 03:44.140
THE BOYS HAD A BALL GETTING
TO KNOW THEIR COUSINS,

03:44.223 --> 03:46.643
WILL RECONNECTED
WITH HIS OLD CROWD,

03:46.726 --> 03:49.312
AND I ATE SO MANY OYSTERS,

03:49.395 --> 03:51.648
I'M PRETTY SURE I HAVE
PEARLS GROWING IN ME.

03:51.731 --> 03:55.109
MORE LIKELY WHAT'S
GROWING INSIDE OF YOU
IS VIBRIO VULNIFICUS.

03:55.193 --> 03:56.694
IT'S A BACTERIAL
CONTAMINATION

03:56.778 --> 03:58.196
CAUSED BY EATING
RAW SEAFOOD.

03:58.279 --> 04:00.114
THERE'S 52,000
CASES A YEAR IN THE
UNITED STATES ALONE.

04:00.198 --> 04:03.159
I FORGOT WE INVITED
THE FUN POLICE.

04:03.242 --> 04:05.703
IGNORE HIM. THAT'S
WHAT LEMON JUICE IS FOR.

04:05.787 --> 04:08.331
YOU SQUIRT THAT ON STUFF,
AND IT KILLS ALL THE BACTERIA.

04:08.414 --> 04:10.291
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE
NOT MY PRIMARY CARE
PHYSICIAN.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.835
OK, THAT WAS GROSS
AND I'M GONNA
CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.254
CAN THE TWO OF YOU
KEEP A SECRET?

04:15.338 --> 04:17.507
HE CAN. I CAN'T.

04:17.590 --> 04:18.841
TELL US ANYWAY?

04:18.925 --> 04:23.179
OK, SO THE FIELD OFFICE
DOWN THERE HAS AN OPENING.

04:23.262 --> 04:24.847
THE JOB'S MINE
IF I WANT IT.

04:24.931 --> 04:26.516
IN NEW ORLEANS?

04:24.931 --> 04:26.516
YEAH.

04:26.599 --> 04:27.850
WAIT. YOU'RE LEAVING?

04:27.934 --> 04:29.686
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
WERE LOOKING AT
OTHER THINGS.

04:29.769 --> 04:33.690
I'M NOT. I PUT MY NAME
ON THE O.P. LIST THERE,

04:33.773 --> 04:36.109
LIKE YEARS AGO, AND I
COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT IT,

04:36.192 --> 04:40.196
BUT APPARENTLY MY NAME
HAS WORKED ITS WAY TO THE TOP.

04:40.279 --> 04:42.407
WHY...I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO FEEL ABOUT THIS.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.117
I MEAN, I SHOULD
BE HAPPY FOR YOU,

04:44.200 --> 04:47.161
BUT THAT MEANS YOU'RE
THERE AND NOT HERE WITH US.

04:47.245 --> 04:49.914
[CELL PHONE RINGING]
AND WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
IF YOU'RE NOT HERE?

04:49.998 --> 04:52.750
[BEEP]
AND THAT'S EMILY.
WE HAVE A CASE.

04:54.252 --> 04:56.254
THIS CONVERSATION
IS NOT OVER.

04:58.256 --> 05:00.550
I DIDN'T SAY I WAS
GONNA TAKE IT.

05:00.633 --> 05:03.177
SORRY.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.179
DEPUTY DIRECTOR
DIDN'T BEAT YOU UP
TOO MUCH, DID HE?

05:05.263 --> 05:08.391
UH, NO. JUST THE USUAL
BUMPS AND BRUISES.
PENELOPE?

05:08.474 --> 05:10.768
TODAY'S TOKE OF ICK
HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO US

05:10.852 --> 05:14.105
BY BEAUMONT, TEXAS,
WHERE A BUSINESSMAN,
TOM MITCHELL,

05:14.188 --> 05:16.190
WAS FOUND LAST NIGHT
IN THE DUMPSTER.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.401
CORONERS SAY HE WAS THERE
AT LEAST 3 DAYS.

05:18.484 --> 05:21.279
EARLIER IN THE WEEK,
THE BODY OF A PROSTITUTE
NAMED ELIZABETH McBRIDE

05:21.362 --> 05:22.071
WAS DISCOVERED
IN A SHALLOW GRAVE

05:22.155 --> 05:24.365
LESS THAN A MILE
FROM THAT DUMPSTER.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.200
WHY DO WE THINK THE
MURDERS ARE CONNECTED?

05:26.284 --> 05:30.329
BECAUSE BOTH OF THEM
WERE MISSING THEIR TONGUES
AND THEIR EARS...

05:30.413 --> 05:32.040
AND THEIR HANDS. AND CAN
SOMEONE START TALKING

05:32.123 --> 05:33.541
SO I CAN STOP
THINKING ABOUT--

05:33.624 --> 05:35.918
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
THAT'S THE END OF IT.

05:36.002 --> 05:39.213
IN THE LAST 48 HOURS,
TOBY STEMPLE, A PROMINENT
LOCAL ATTORNEY,

05:39.297 --> 05:41.591
AND ANOTHER PROSTITUTE, CINDY
WILSON, HAVE ALSO GONE MISSING.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.217
REID: AFFLUENT MEN
AND STREET PROSTITUTES.

05:43.301 --> 05:45.553
THIS UNSUB'S TARGETING
TWO DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT
VICTIM TYPES.

05:45.636 --> 05:47.847
JAREAU: OH, MAYBE THE MEN
WERE CLIENTS OF THE WOMEN.

05:47.930 --> 05:49.098
THIS COULD BE ABOUT REVENGE.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.809
OR SOMEONE
WHO DISAPPROVES,
A MORAL ENFORCER.

05:51.893 --> 05:54.228
ALVEZ: YEAH, HANDS,
EARS, TONGUES.

05:54.312 --> 05:55.938
THE MUTILATION
IS ROUGH.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.273
HOPEFULLY, THIS IS
ALL POST-MORTEM.

05:57.356 --> 06:01.819
BEFORE, DURING, OR AFTER,
THIS IS PERSONAL
ANY WAY YOU SLICE IT.

06:01.903 --> 06:04.280
PARDON THE EXPRESSION.

06:04.363 --> 06:06.449
WELL, LET'S GET ON IT.
WHEELS UP IN 20.

06:06.532 --> 06:10.244
GIVE ME CREDIT FOR TRYING
TO DO THE RIGHT THING,

06:10.328 --> 06:13.831
BUT YOU NEED TO FIND ME.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.541
YOU NEED TO STOP ME.

06:17.376 --> 06:18.961
PLEASE.

07:11.472 --> 07:14.392
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
ABC STUDIOS, LLC AND CBS, INC.

07:21.065 --> 07:21.983
MAN, VOICE-OVER: THERE'S
A SCOTTISH PROVERB:

07:22.066 --> 07:25.820
"THEY TALK OF MY DRINKING
BUT NEVER MY THIRST."

07:25.903 --> 07:30.241
PRENTISS: SO, THE VICTIMOLOGY
BETWEEN TOM MITCHELL
AND ELIZABETH McBRIDE

07:30.324 --> 07:31.659
COULD NOT BE
MORE DIFFERENT.

07:31.742 --> 07:34.662
SIMMONS: AND HE WAS A
WEALTHY, WELL-RESPECTED
MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY,

07:34.745 --> 07:36.372
CHURCHGOER, COACHED
HIS SON'S BASKETBALL TEAM.

07:36.455 --> 07:37.540
LEWIS: SHE,
ON THE OTHER HAND,

07:37.623 --> 07:40.376
HAD THE SADLY FAMILIAR
TRAJECTORY OF
A TROUBLED YOUTH,

07:40.459 --> 07:41.878
ADDICTION,
SPORADIC HOMELESSNESS.

07:41.961 --> 07:44.046
EARS AND TONGUES REMOVED.

07:44.130 --> 07:47.466
AND...WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
HEAR NO EVIL, SPEAK NO EVIL?

07:47.550 --> 07:49.093
JAREAU: BUT HE LEAVES
THE EYES.

07:49.177 --> 07:50.595
SO IT'S OK TO SEE EVIL?

07:50.678 --> 07:53.514
YOU GUYS, WE WERE RIGHT
TO BE WORRIED ABOUT THAT
THING WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.558
THE POLICE JUST FOUND THE BODIES
OF THE TWO MISSING PEOPLE.

07:55.641 --> 07:56.434
WHERE?

07:56.517 --> 07:58.060
GARCIA: WELL, THE ATTORNEY,
TOBY STEMPLE,

07:58.144 --> 07:59.520
WAS FOUND IN
AN ABANDONED INCINERATOR,

07:59.604 --> 08:03.566
AND THIS CINDY WILSON
WAS FOUND BURIED IN THE
WOODS LIKE THE OTHER WOMAN.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.443
AS FAR AS THE MISSING
BODY PARTS GO,

08:05.526 --> 08:07.361
SUFFICE TO SAY
SECOND VERSE, SAME AS THE FIRST.

08:07.445 --> 08:09.280
YOU KNOW, THERE'S
A STARK CONTRAST
IN DISPOSAL METHODS

08:09.363 --> 08:10.281
AS WELL AS VICTIMOLOGY.

08:10.364 --> 08:12.700
THE WOMEN ARE BURIED
WITH CARE IN SECLUDED AREAS.

08:12.783 --> 08:15.286
THE MEN HE DISCARDS
IN PUBLIC PLACES LIKE TRASH.

08:15.369 --> 08:17.079
YEAH, BIG-TIME
ANGER IMBALANCE.

08:17.163 --> 08:19.457
LUKE, SPENCE, GO TO
THE M.E.'S OFFICE.

08:19.540 --> 08:21.417
J.J., TARA, SEE IF
ANY OTHER WOMEN WHO
WORK THE STREETS

08:21.500 --> 08:22.585
HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD.

08:22.668 --> 08:25.296
MATT, YOU'LL TALK
TO THE FAMILIES
OF THE MALE VICTIMS.

08:25.379 --> 08:28.007
DAVE AND I WILL SET UP
WITH THE LOCAL P.D.

08:30.343 --> 08:33.596
MAN: WE'RE GOING THROUGH
OUR MISSING PERSONS REPORTS
FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS,

08:33.679 --> 08:35.765
SEE IF SOMEBODY ELSE
JUMPS OUT.

08:35.848 --> 08:37.391
WERE YOU FAMILIAR
WITH THE VICTIMS?

08:37.475 --> 08:38.601
CINDY AND LIZ, YEAH.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.770
THEY WERE IN ALL THE
TIME FOR SOLICITATION.

08:40.853 --> 08:42.605
THEY WERE GOOD GIRLS
WITH BIG HEARTS.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.441
THEY JUST...WENT DOWN
A TOUGH ROAD IS ALL.

08:45.524 --> 08:47.318
WHAT ABOUT THE MEN?

08:47.401 --> 08:50.196
NO, SIR, BUT
THEY BOTH HAVE MONEY

08:50.279 --> 08:52.949
AND COME FROM OLD,
ESTABLISHED FAMILIES.

08:53.032 --> 08:55.284
I MEAN, THE MITCHELL
CLAN, THE STEMPLE CLAN,

08:55.368 --> 08:57.954
THEY BEEN PART OF
BEAUMONT SINCE FOREVER.

08:58.037 --> 08:59.455
UH, YOU FOLKS CAN
SET UP IN HERE.

08:59.538 --> 09:01.290
THAT'S PERFECT.
THANK YOU.

08:59.538 --> 09:01.290
YOU'RE WELCOME.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.291
EXCUSE ME.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.126
CHIEF, YOU NEED
TO SEE THIS.

09:09.257 --> 09:10.216
DID THIS COME
IN THE MAIL?

09:10.299 --> 09:12.969
WOMAN: NO. ONE OF OUR
OFFICERS STOPPED FOR COFFEE,

09:13.052 --> 09:15.096
AND IT WAS ON THE HOOD
OF HIS SQUAD CAR WHEN
HE CAME OUT.

09:15.179 --> 09:16.430
LET'S RUN THEM FOR PRINTS.

09:19.725 --> 09:22.103
BOTH EARS.

09:22.186 --> 09:25.356
BUT THEN HE ONLY
TOOK ONE HAND FROM
EACH OF THE VICTIMS,

09:25.439 --> 09:26.816
THE LEFT HAND.

09:26.899 --> 09:28.317
MERCIFULLY, THE VICTIMS
WERE ALREADY DEAD

09:28.401 --> 09:29.986
WHEN THE BODY PARTS
WERE REMOVED.

09:30.069 --> 09:31.988
SO WE'RE PROBABLY
NOT DEALING WITH
A SADIST.

09:32.071 --> 09:33.906
WERE YOU ABLE TO
DETERMINE THE COD?

09:33.990 --> 09:36.117
THE WOMEN,
MANUAL STRANGULATION;

09:36.200 --> 09:37.493
THE MEN DIED FROM
MULTIPLE STAB WOUNDS.

09:37.576 --> 09:40.121
IT'S NOT EASY TO
DISARTICULATE A HAND
AT THE WRIST.

09:40.204 --> 09:41.664
DID THEY DEMONSTRATE
ANY SURGICAL SKILL?

09:41.747 --> 09:44.500
WITH THE WOMEN, YES.
IF NOT SKILL, AT LEAST CARE.

09:44.583 --> 09:46.460
REMOVALS WERE CLEAN
AND PRECISE.

09:46.544 --> 09:48.337
AMPUTATIONS ON THE MEN
WERE MUCH CRUDER.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.172
ANY DEFENSIVE WOUNDS?

09:50.256 --> 09:52.008
NO. THE MEN DID HAVE
BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA

09:52.091 --> 09:54.468
TO THE BACK OF
THEIR SKULLS, THOUGH.

09:56.637 --> 09:58.014
BLITZ ATTACKED.

09:58.097 --> 09:59.473
NO SUCH INJURIES
ON THE WOMEN,

09:59.557 --> 10:01.517
BUT SEDATIVES DID SHOW UP
ON BOTH THEIR TOX SCREENS.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.394
GIVEN THEIR HISTORY
OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE,

10:03.477 --> 10:05.354
IT'S GONNA BE DIFFICULT
TO SAY WITH ANY CERTAINTY

10:05.438 --> 10:06.689
WHETHER OR NOT THE UNSUB
DRUGGED THEM.

10:06.772 --> 10:07.982
THEY MIGHT HAVE
SELF-MEDICATED

10:08.065 --> 10:09.525
AS PART OF THEIR
NORMAL DAILY ROUTINE.

10:09.608 --> 10:11.485
ONE MORE THING--
THE WOMEN WERE NUDE

10:11.569 --> 10:13.362
BUT DIDN'T SHOW ANY EVIDENCE
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.

10:13.446 --> 10:16.365
AND THEIR BURIAL WAS WHAT I
GUESS YOU COULD CALL CEREMONIAL.

10:16.449 --> 10:17.825
IN WHAT WAY?

10:17.908 --> 10:19.535
THEY WERE WRAPPED
IN A WHITE SHEET

10:19.618 --> 10:21.495
AND BURIED FACE-DOWN.

10:22.830 --> 10:25.374
A WHITE SHEET? COULD BE
A SYMBOL OF PURITY.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.877
YOU KNOW, TRY TO RESTORE
THEIR LOST INNOCENCE?

10:27.960 --> 10:30.171
WELL, I TALKED TO TOM MITCHELL
AND TOBY STEMPLE'S WIVES,

10:30.254 --> 10:32.381
AND THEY BOTH SWEAR THEIR
HUSBANDS WOULD NEVER
FREQUENT A PROSTITUTE.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.384
WELL, THEY NEVER DO
UNTIL THEY DO.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.053
I BROUGHT IN
KAYLA JACKSON.

10:37.136 --> 10:39.388
SHE WORKED THE STREETS
WITH CINDY WILSON.

10:39.472 --> 10:43.059
SHE SAW THE UNSUB WITH HER
THE DAY CINDY DISAPPEARED.

10:43.142 --> 10:45.353
THIS IS HER DESCRIPTION.

10:45.436 --> 10:47.897
KAYLA SAID IT WAS
SUCH A GOOD LIKENESS,

10:47.980 --> 10:49.523
IT SENT CHILLS
DOWN HER SPINE.

10:51.650 --> 10:53.903
[PEOPLE TALKING AND LAUGHING
INDISTINCTLY]

10:53.986 --> 10:57.073
WOMAN: NO, NO, WAIT. STOP.
STOP. MOM. THAT WASN'T THE DEAL.

10:57.156 --> 11:00.785
COREY AGREED TO PAY HALF,
AND HE HASN'T SENT ME A DIME.

11:00.868 --> 11:03.412
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN
DEFEND HIM. I REALLY DON'T.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.164

11:06.540 --> 11:09.377

11:09.460 --> 11:11.921

I'M GOOD.

11:12.004 --> 11:13.422
EVERYTHING OK?

11:13.506 --> 11:14.924
TRUST ME, YOU DON'T
WANT TO KNOW.

11:15.007 --> 11:17.468
SURE I DO.
TELL ME.

11:17.551 --> 11:20.429
JUST SAME OLD, SAME OLD.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.807
MY EX MOVED TO FLORIDA AND
LEFT ME WITH A PILE OF BILLS,

11:22.890 --> 11:24.475
BILLS HE RAN UP.

11:24.558 --> 11:27.103
AND NOW, EVEN MY OWN
MOTHER'S TAKING HIS SIDE.

11:27.186 --> 11:28.604
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

11:28.687 --> 11:31.440
OH, MY EX CAN PLAY THE
VICTIM CARD VERY WELL.

11:31.524 --> 11:35.236

TO YOUR TROUBLES. HA HA!

11:43.035 --> 11:45.454

NOTHING MAKES SENSE.

ARE YOU CAR SHOPPING?

11:51.210 --> 11:54.463

HANDLE THE MUD.

BELONGS TO CINDY WILSON.

AND UNFORTUNATELY, HIS PRINTS
AREN'T IN THE SYSTEM.

OK, WELL, WE SHOULD GET
THIS TAPE OUT ON THE

IT'S FROM LYDIA.

COULD I EVER...

OUT FOR A SPIN?

HAVE BEEN RECOVERED.

DOING WITH 'EM?

14:07.888 --> 14:10.224
NORMALLY, YOU'D
THINK SOUVENIRS,

14:10.307 --> 14:13.227

OF ROTTED FLESH TO HAVE
HANGING AROUND THE HOUSE.

FOR DISPLAY.

14:15.312 --> 14:16.355
YEAH, BUT DISPLAY WHERE?

14:16.438 --> 14:18.941
WELL, THE MEN WERE
IN THEIR 50s, BUT
THE FEMALE VICTIMS

14:19.024 --> 14:21.277
BOTH HAVE A 25-YEAR
AGE VARIANCE.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.821
MAKING IT LESS LIKELY
THE FEMALES ARE SURROGATES.

CONFUSION IN THE

AS TO WHAT THE

THINGS TO HIM.

14:28.867 --> 14:31.161
WELL, HE AGED UP A GENERATION
WITH CINDY WILSON.

14:31.245 --> 14:33.205
SO SEXUALIZING A MOTHER FIGURE?

14:33.289 --> 14:35.291
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN
THE FACE-DOWN BURIALS.

14:35.374 --> 14:36.834

TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

AND I BLAME MYSELF,

WAS A PRETTY BIG GUY,

15:42.274 --> 15:44.193
NOT SO EASY TO BLITZ ATTACK

15:44.276 --> 15:46.320

A GUN TO CONTROL HIM.

15:46.403 --> 15:49.073

TO HIS PATTERN OF

PROSTITUTES.

15:50.658 --> 15:54.161

WERE AFFLUENT,

AND ACCORDING TO HIS

A HARD TIME PAYING THE BILLS.

TO DO WITH WEALTH.

TO JUSTIFY HIS MURDERS.

WHAT HE DOES TO HIS
FEMALE VICTIMS.

HE WRAPS THEM IN WHITE, HE
CUTS OFF THEIR LEFT HANDS.

THE HAND THAT TRADITIONALLY
HOLDS A WEDDING RING.

17:12.573 --> 17:14.116

FOR IS A WHITE MALE

TO MID-30s.

HE IS PHYSICALLY FIT,
MOBILE, AND ORGANIZED.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.091

IS TARGETING TWO
VICTIM TYPES--

17:31.175 --> 17:32.801
FEMALE PROSTITUTES
AND BUSINESSMEN

17:32.885 --> 17:35.804
WHO COME FROM FAMILIES
WITH LONG-STANDING TIES
TO THE COMMUNITY.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.431

IS UNIQUE IN THAT

17:37.514 --> 17:38.849
HE'S REACHED OUT
DIRECTLY TO US

17:38.932 --> 17:42.978
AND SEEMS TO HAVE A GENUINE
DESIRE TO HAVE US PUT
A STOP TO HIS CRIMES,

17:43.061 --> 17:44.813

WON'T ALLOW IT.

THEY RECOGNIZE HIS VOICE

17:51.111 --> 17:52.780
NEEDS TO COME FORWARD
IMMEDIATELY.

WHILE OPERATING IN
PUBLIC WHEN HUNTING AND
ABDUCTING HIS VICTIMS,

17:55.574 --> 17:57.659
THE ACTUAL MURDERS
ALMOST CERTAINLY
TAKE PLACE

17:57.743 --> 17:59.495
IN A REMOTE,
SECURE AREA.

ASPECTS OF THE KILLINGS

18:01.705 --> 18:04.792
LEAD US TO BELIEVE
THE UNSUB IS TRYING
TO RE-CREATE

OR PERHAPS MAKE A MOCKERY
OF AN ACTUAL WEDDING.

BECAUSE OF A FATHER'S
INFIDELITY WITH A PROSTITUTE.

ALVEZ: BECAUSE ONE OF THE
PROSTITUTES APPEARS TO BE
A MOTHER SURROGATE,

18:17.930 --> 18:23.185
ANOTHER POSSIBILITY IS
THAT HE IS THE CHILD OF
A PROSTITUTE HIMSELF.

STRESS ENOUGH THE NEED
FOR HEIGHTENED CAUTION

18:26.980 --> 18:28.398
AND AWARENESS
IN THE COMMUNITY,

HIGH-RISK CATEGORIES.

WILL BE OUT IN FORCE

IS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT,

GENERAL PUBLIC,

18:40.285 --> 18:44.373
BUT WE ARE ALSO ADDRESSING
THE PERPETRATOR OF THESE
CRIMES HIMSELF.

18:44.456 --> 18:47.209
YOU PLEADED WITH US
TO STOP YOU.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.002
ALLOW US TO HELP.

18:49.086 --> 18:51.213
THIS CAN END NOW,
IF YOU WANT.

18:51.296 --> 18:54.258
FULL DISCLOSURE.
FEAR OF CHANGE IS
FORCING ME

18:54.341 --> 18:56.552
TO CONTINUE TO EAT
FROZEN DESSERT FOODS.
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

18:56.635 --> 19:00.389

IS THE SON OF A COUPLE
WHO USED TO LIVE IN BEAUMONT.

DO YOU THINK THAT, NEWBIE?

19:02.182 --> 19:04.226
OH, MY GOSH. YOU JUST
NARROWED THE CANDIDATES

19:04.309 --> 19:06.395
TO LIKE 1.2 MILLION PEOPLE.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.438
IT'S JUST THE SUGAR
TALKING.

19:08.522 --> 19:11.900
WE ALSO THINK THAT
HIS MOTHER MAY OR MAY NOT

19:11.984 --> 19:14.403
HAVE WORKED AS A
PROSTITUTE AT ONE TIME.

19:14.486 --> 19:18.240
BUT DAD IS PROBABLY A MEMBER
OF ONE OF THE PROMINENT,
LONG-ENTRENCHED FAMILIES HERE.

19:18.323 --> 19:19.908

19:19.992 --> 19:21.910
IT'S UNSURE.
I MEAN, ASPECTS OF
A WEDDING RITUAL

19:21.994 --> 19:23.036
ARE TANGLED UP
IN HIS M.O.,

19:23.120 --> 19:24.913
BUT IT COULD JUST BE
PROJECTION ON HIS PART,
YOU KNOW?

19:26.081 --> 19:28.083
THIS COULD HAVE BEEN
AN ENGAGEMENT THAT FELL THROUGH.

19:28.166 --> 19:29.585

19:29.668 --> 19:30.961
BY THE WAY,

19:31.044 --> 19:31.920
NO, WHY?

GANG UP ON HER

19:54.192 --> 19:56.945

CONCEIVED, ACTUALLY,

BY THE WAY YOU'RE
LOOKING AT ME

WAY TOO FAST,
SO LET ME BACK UP.

UM, IT WASN'T A MISTAKE
THAT WE MET,

20:26.725 --> 20:29.603
THAT YOU TOLD ME ABOUT
YOUR FAMILY BEFORE I
EVEN KNEW WHO YOU WERE.

WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT

20:43.408 --> 20:44.826
IS SO MUCH MORE

IN BEAUMONT FROM 1987 TO 1992.

22:04.781 --> 22:06.616
THERE WERE 20,000 BABIES BORN.

THEY'RE BOTH JUVENILES,

22:34.978 --> 22:36.730

ARE SEALED TIGHT.

THE MONEY.

SHE WAS GONNA GET IT.
