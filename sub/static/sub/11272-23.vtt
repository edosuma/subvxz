00:05.561 --> 00:09.808
- Who's the lovely lady?
- An applicant for the waitress job.

00:09.982 --> 00:15.190
lt isn't easy for him to find somebody
to work for the wages he pays you.

00:15.363 --> 00:19.361
With tips l clear about 500 bucks
a week, Clavin.

00:23.080 --> 00:27.326
- That can't be right, is it?
- l did her taxes.

00:27.500 --> 00:29.742
You're saying that a Federal employee,

00:29.920 --> 00:33.170
entrusted with the most noble
service of our society,

00:33.340 --> 00:37.468
makes less money than a wench
who serves beer to slobs on bar stools?

00:37.636 --> 00:40.340
Makes sense to me, Cliffie.

00:40.513 --> 00:44.925
No, really, l could go up to
three days or so without mail.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074

02:02.261 --> 02:05.215
Carla, l'd like you to meet Sydney.

02:05.389 --> 02:08.592
Sydney is an applicant
for our waitress opening.

02:08.768 --> 02:11.258
She passed my interview
with flying colours.

02:11.437 --> 02:15.137
Pending your approval,
l'd like to start her this afternoon.

02:15.316 --> 02:20.061
- Have you served the public before?
- You mean dressed?

02:21.530 --> 02:24.152
Take a hike, Sydney.

02:24.325 --> 02:27.279
l'll call you this afternoon,
see how you're doing.

02:27.453 --> 02:29.611
Thank you. You're a very nice man.

02:29.788 --> 02:33.489
You're nice, too. We've only known
each other for a few minutes,

02:33.667 --> 02:36.158
but l feel like
we've known each other all day.

02:36.336 --> 02:39.089
- Yeah, me, too.
- You take care.

02:40.132 --> 02:45.375
You know, Sam, when Diane left
for Europe...thank you, God...

02:45.555 --> 02:50.679
you promised to hire an actual waitress,
not a girl that you love and leave.

02:50.851 --> 02:55.846
They're bad for business. They never
last a week and l do all the work.

02:56.023 --> 03:01.313
You can give your approval before l hire
them, but you don't have to be so picky.

03:01.487 --> 03:07.691
l want someone who doesn't make us
think of the word boob at the same time.

03:09.745 --> 03:13.659
What is this, lBM?
Come on, let's not argue about this.

03:13.833 --> 03:17.367
We can find somebody who's
going to make us both very happy.

03:17.545 --> 03:20.961
- Brenda Wood?
- Hi. That's me.

03:21.841 --> 03:26.835
Hi there, Brenda. Come on down here.
Let's take a look at your application.

03:27.012 --> 03:32.137
l see that your turn-ons include
banana daiquiris by a fireside,

03:32.310 --> 03:34.551
and men in tight jeans.

03:34.728 --> 03:38.857
- You're cute.
- l'm sold. Come over here.

03:39.024 --> 03:41.811
- l'd like you to meet Brenda.
- Beat it.

03:41.986 --> 03:44.025
- But, Sam...
- You heard me.

03:44.196 --> 03:46.818
Back to the bimbo union hall.

03:48.659 --> 03:52.906
Darn it, Brenda. l guess
Carla thought you were overqualified.

03:53.080 --> 03:56.330
You know what might ease
that sting of rejection?

03:56.500 --> 04:00.035
What would happen if l were to slip
into tight jeans this weekend

04:00.212 --> 04:03.462
and have you over to my place
for a banana daiquiri?

04:03.632 --> 04:08.259
- Do you have a fireplace?
- No, but l got a sofa that's flammable.

04:08.429 --> 04:13.505
- That'd be fine.
- All right. You take care. Bye-bye.

04:15.436 --> 04:18.769
- The search continues, Sammy?
- lt's tough being me.

04:20.023 --> 04:23.724
- OK, Lillian Huxley.
- How do you do, Mr Malone?

04:23.902 --> 04:29.656
Hi, Lillian. Thank you for coming down,
but this position has been filled already.

04:29.825 --> 04:34.368
- We'll keep your résumé on file.
- Freeze, slimeball.

04:34.538 --> 04:36.745
- Yes, Carla.
- You lech.

04:36.916 --> 04:40.450
This is the best résumé l've ever seen.
Look at these references.

04:40.628 --> 04:43.545
She's been schlepping booze
for 25 years.

04:43.714 --> 04:49.419
And my turn-ons include hunting dogs,
Thackeray and Welsh rarebit.

04:49.594 --> 04:52.429
She's exactly what we need.
A career waitress.

04:52.597 --> 04:54.804
- You are?
- That l am, Mr Malone.

04:54.975 --> 05:00.265
l'm one of those people who felt the tug
of their true calling early in life.

05:00.439 --> 05:06.358
When l was but 1 8, l filled in one day
for a mate at a pub. Excuse me.

05:06.528 --> 05:11.106
l realised that day that l could have
no happier or finer destiny in store

05:11.283 --> 05:14.533
than distributing refreshments
in a public house.

05:14.703 --> 05:18.202
Through the years l've lead many
a rugger side in a bawdy song,

05:18.373 --> 05:21.659
and countless times offered
my shoulder to cry on.

05:21.835 --> 05:24.539
But never once
have l regretted my decision.

05:24.713 --> 05:29.790
l shall consider my life well spent if it can
be honestly carved on my gravestone...

05:29.968 --> 05:34.013
''Lillian Huxley never kept
a thirsty man waiting for his ale,

05:34.181 --> 05:39.008
''and she always brought him
a wee bit more than a pint.''

05:39.185 --> 05:41.475
Bravo!

05:47.819 --> 05:50.856
l'm not too sure l like her attitude.

06:05.212 --> 06:07.833
<i>Bene</i>, <i>molto bene.</i>

06:08.924 --> 06:15.377
Your heat control is over there.
lf you need anything, call the front desk.

06:15.555 --> 06:17.962
Thank you very much. That'll be all.

06:18.141 --> 06:24.678
Listen, 200,000 lire,
that's about right, right?

06:26.358 --> 06:30.521
- <i>Grazie</i>, <i>signore.</i>
- <i>Prego.</i>

06:33.239 --> 06:36.026
Frasier, a letter from Cheers.

06:36.200 --> 06:42.204
Wait, it's not a letter.
lt's a Lillian Huxley's résumé.

06:43.458 --> 06:48.084
And it's signed,
''Ha ha, you're out of here for ever.''

06:48.254 --> 06:51.670
Always nice to hear from Carla.

06:51.841 --> 06:54.628
Diane,
Cheers is thousands of miles away.

06:54.802 --> 06:58.171
Let's leave them
on the other side of the great ocean?

06:58.348 --> 07:01.598
- Of course. l love you.
- <i>Et tu</i>, <i>Diane.</i>

07:02.686 --> 07:06.933
Did l just hear you say that you tipped
that bellboy 200,000 lire?

07:07.107 --> 07:10.807
What is it? A dollar or two?
This inflated currency is ridiculous.

07:10.986 --> 07:15.980
l keep expecting a bum to walk up and
ask for a million lire for a cup of coffee.

07:16.157 --> 07:21.033
You tipped the man $1 00
to bring our bags eight feet.

07:21.204 --> 07:23.825
Are you sure?

07:23.998 --> 07:28.210
This'll get a hearty laugh
out of the folks at the institute.

07:28.378 --> 07:31.628
Just explain it to him.
l'm sure he'll understand.

07:31.798 --> 07:35.131
- You mean go down and get it back?
- What else?

07:35.301 --> 07:39.927
These people think so little
of Americans as it is...

07:40.097 --> 07:42.221
- l'll go.
- No.

07:42.392 --> 07:46.010
lf l send a woman,
they'd think even less of me. l'll do it.

07:46.187 --> 07:48.144
My brave little tourist.

07:48.314 --> 07:52.941
Yes. l guess it's time to nip
this thing in the bud.

07:54.070 --> 07:56.359
Come in.

08:38.739 --> 08:41.525
Let's sing
''Don't Dilly Dally On The Way''.

08:41.700 --> 08:46.197
No, l'm tired of that one. How about
a little ''Knees Up, Mother Brown''?

08:46.372 --> 08:48.993
No, l'm afraid l'm too overcome.

08:49.166 --> 08:52.666
All right,
let's sell some beers around here.

08:54.506 --> 08:59.499
My aching back.
My postal career is over.

09:00.511 --> 09:03.428
Cliff, you look terrible.

09:03.597 --> 09:08.556
- Was today Sears catalogue day?
- That's right.

09:08.728 --> 09:14.314
Yeah and that's not all. Spiegel
catalogue came out at the same time.

09:14.525 --> 09:17.526
lt's a phenomenon
that happens once every 27 years

09:17.695 --> 09:20.814
when both marketing strategies
are in the same equinox.

09:22.158 --> 09:25.408
- Come here, you great silly sausage.
- What's going on?

09:25.578 --> 09:28.199
Hush, pet.

09:28.372 --> 09:32.999
Fear not. One, two...

09:40.635 --> 09:44.169
Hey, Lillian, thank you very much.

09:44.347 --> 09:48.261
l feel like grabbing every woman
in the joint and just dancing.

09:48.434 --> 09:50.972
How much to put him back
the way he was?

09:51.145 --> 09:53.387
Carla, l've got customers to serve.

09:54.482 --> 09:58.314
Well, Sammy, Lillian's week is almost up.

09:58.486 --> 10:01.403
Will you keep her on?
l'm dying of curiosity.

10:01.572 --> 10:06.696
l admit when l'm wrong. She's terrific.
The customers love her. She's perfect.

10:06.868 --> 10:11.578
There's no chance of any romantic
complication to screw things up.

10:11.749 --> 10:16.078
Amen. No more sex stuff with anybody
even remotely connected with this bar.

10:16.253 --> 10:17.712
Promise?

10:17.879 --> 10:20.585
On my honour,
as a great looking human being.

10:20.758 --> 10:25.218
Anyway, l have just seen the woman
in whose arms l hope to die.

10:27.598 --> 10:29.840
Hi there. Allow me to introduce myself.

10:30.017 --> 10:32.638
l'm Sam Malone,
the next love of your life.

10:32.811 --> 10:37.639
- l've heard you Yanks were bold.
- You sound exactly like...

10:37.817 --> 10:39.892
- Carolyn.
- Mummy.

10:40.068 --> 10:42.524
- Sam.
- Carla.

10:50.537 --> 10:54.202
Your mother never told me
she had a daughter.

10:54.374 --> 10:58.704
She never told me
she had such a handsome boss.

10:58.879 --> 11:01.666
Carolyn's visiting
her old mummy for a few days.

11:01.840 --> 11:04.248
- Lillian, you're up here.
- Excuse me.

11:04.426 --> 11:07.676
l must teach this bloke
how to play a proper game of darts.

11:07.846 --> 11:11.464
l'll be back in
an embarrassingly short time.

11:12.643 --> 11:18.645
So, Carolyn, how do you like Boston
now that you've seen the sight?

11:18.815 --> 11:21.437
- l love it.
- Sam, could l talk to you?

11:21.609 --> 11:23.899
- Not now.
- Now.

11:24.071 --> 11:26.988
l'm on final approach
and am cleared for landing.

11:27.157 --> 11:30.858
Haul your butt over here now, sky king.

11:31.912 --> 11:35.162
Will you excuse me for a moment?
What?

11:35.332 --> 11:38.784
lf you take Carolyn out,
it's going to go bad like always

11:38.961 --> 11:41.878
and you'll lose the two best
waitresses you ever had.

11:42.047 --> 11:44.289
- Carla, l hardly...
- l'm warning you.

11:44.466 --> 11:46.543
You go out with her and l quit.

11:46.718 --> 11:49.007
- You don't mean that.
- Try me.

11:49.179 --> 11:53.391
OK, all right. As far as l'm concerned,
Carolyn's off limits.

11:53.559 --> 11:55.598
That's your brain talking, Sam.

11:55.769 --> 12:00.396
l would like to hear from the part
of your body that does the thinking.

12:01.483 --> 12:03.725
lt's in agreement, too.

12:05.070 --> 12:08.355
l'm sorry to be
such a miserable host here.

12:08.531 --> 12:11.403
So you're from England?

12:11.577 --> 12:16.368
Yes. l'm just in the States for a few days
to shoot a layout for British Vogue.

12:16.540 --> 12:22.624
Wait. That calls for a little of
the old welcome-to-the-US champagne.

12:22.795 --> 12:26.211
- Great.
- A little of the old bubbly here.

12:26.382 --> 12:28.791
So you're a model?

12:28.969 --> 12:34.307
Yes, l do lingerie mostly. Teddies,
merry widows, garter belts.

12:34.474 --> 12:38.519
- This is my portfolio.
- l'll give you $1 ,000 for it.

12:39.646 --> 12:45.067
l don't know if l want you to look at it.
l only brought it in to show mummy.

12:46.194 --> 12:48.899
Come on. Give her a little privacy.

12:49.072 --> 12:53.615
- l suppose it won't do any harm.
- All right, here we go.

12:57.205 --> 12:59.696
lnteresting shot. l like that one.

12:59.874 --> 13:02.959
That's nice.
That's nice lighting on that one.

13:03.128 --> 13:05.998
Bet they used an f-stop on that one.

13:07.465 --> 13:10.799
Now, see,
l like the composition on that.

13:10.969 --> 13:15.097
- What are those? Ducks?
- Yes, that's right.

13:16.557 --> 13:21.267
l really didn't want to do this one nude,
but you know...

13:21.438 --> 13:25.649
No, l think it's very tasteful.
lt makes a point.

13:26.817 --> 13:29.024
Sammy, the ice.

13:30.113 --> 13:32.521
Thank you very much.

13:32.699 --> 13:37.492
Could you just give me a second here?
l'll be right back.

13:40.916 --> 13:43.620
Carla, can l speak to you
for a moment here?

13:43.793 --> 13:47.838
Remember that conversation we had
about me not going out with Carolyn?

13:48.006 --> 13:50.082
Can we pretend it never took place?

13:50.258 --> 13:53.959
You bet. l'll just go pack my stuff.
Nice knowing you.

13:54.137 --> 13:58.550
Listen. come on.
The lady is coming on to me.

13:58.725 --> 14:02.769
lf l resist,
l could damage some organs here.

14:03.813 --> 14:07.182
l don't care. lf you go out with her, l quit.

14:07.358 --> 14:11.902
OK, all right, fine. There are millions
of women on this planet.

14:12.072 --> 14:14.313
l can certainly forgo one of them.

14:15.867 --> 14:21.323
lronic that she's the most gorgeous one
l've ever seen, but that's life.

14:22.791 --> 14:25.198
Sam, the champagne is marvellous.

14:25.376 --> 14:28.081
You know how to make a girl
feel welcome.

14:28.254 --> 14:31.172
That's nothing. l do that for everybody.

14:32.759 --> 14:35.759
She's really coming on to Sam,
isn't she?

14:35.928 --> 14:37.756
Sam. That's rich.

14:37.931 --> 14:41.928
Norm, your naivety amazes me.

14:42.101 --> 14:44.141
What are you talking about?

14:44.312 --> 14:47.313
She's doing all this for my benefit.

14:47.482 --> 14:50.685
You notice she's talking loud
so l can hear everything?

14:50.860 --> 14:55.855
That woman wants me more than
any woman has wanted me before.

14:56.032 --> 14:59.733
Cliffie, sometimes you really scare me.

15:08.419 --> 15:13.165
Sam, what about this Cape Cod place
l've been hearing about?

15:14.258 --> 15:18.208
l hear that it's terribly romantic
at this time of year.

15:18.387 --> 15:21.721
Well, you know, l guess it could be.

15:21.891 --> 15:25.840
Tell me, are there
any clothing-optional beaches there?

15:26.020 --> 15:28.511
l like to get an all-over tan.

15:30.399 --> 15:34.444
l know it's more common in Europe
than it is in America,

15:34.612 --> 15:39.772
so l came prepared with a bikini,
but it's such a skimpy little thing.

15:42.412 --> 15:47.406
l'm having a real hard time with this map.
l just can't make head or tail of it.

15:47.583 --> 15:51.082
l really don't think l'm going
to be able to find my way there.

15:51.253 --> 15:54.254
l'll take you.

15:55.508 --> 16:00.135
- Great. What a lovely surprise.
- l'll take you.

16:02.431 --> 16:04.839
l'll let Carla go and l'll take you.

16:05.935 --> 16:09.933
l'll turn this into a self-serve bar
and l'll take you.

16:10.106 --> 16:14.815
- When did you have in mind?
- l'll take you right this very minute.

16:14.985 --> 16:17.655
- My car is outside.
- What the hell's going on?

16:17.822 --> 16:20.360
Carla, l can explain this. l'll take you.

16:20.533 --> 16:24.744
- You make me sick.
- l know. l'll take you.

16:26.163 --> 16:28.868
Carla, l'm a weak man.

16:30.084 --> 16:35.624
Someday l will find a cure for what
l have, but please, let me have this.

16:36.882 --> 16:39.753
Don't make me beg.
Please, don't make me beg, Carla.

16:39.927 --> 16:43.627
- Tell your mommy not to make me beg.
- Get off.

16:43.805 --> 16:48.800
- ls that a yes?
- At least she's not Diane.

16:48.978 --> 16:51.599
- Look, l'll tell you what.
- What?

16:51.772 --> 16:54.559
Tell Lillian you're taking her daughter out.

16:54.733 --> 16:57.688
lf she says it's OK,
l'll stick around for a while.

16:57.861 --> 17:00.567
ls that all? l'll do it.
l'll make you proud of me.

17:00.740 --> 17:02.779
Just one more minute.

17:02.950 --> 17:06.200
Have one more for the bed,
the beach, the road.

17:06.369 --> 17:09.156
Lillian, can l see you
in my office for a minute?

17:09.330 --> 17:12.451
- Certainly. Back in a jiffy, darling.
- Super, Mummy.

17:12.626 --> 17:15.377
Carolyn's filling out nicely,
don't you think?

17:18.507 --> 17:22.041
Lillian, l got a problem here.

17:22.219 --> 17:25.588
ln the past l've gotten into trouble
with my waitresses

17:25.765 --> 17:28.386
by getting
romantically involved with them.

17:28.559 --> 17:33.601
You are a fantastic waitress. l do not
want to do anything to lose you.

17:33.772 --> 17:37.472
Don't say another word.
l understand you completely.

17:37.651 --> 17:39.893
- You do?
- Of course.

17:40.071 --> 17:44.530
Thank you. l just wanted
to get your approval first.

17:44.699 --> 17:49.907
Sam, how can you be so civilised
when your very blood is boiling?

17:53.834 --> 17:57.084
Don't you think l haven't been feeling
the same urges?

17:57.254 --> 18:02.130
Don't you think l haven't felt
the same unconquerable chemistry?

18:02.300 --> 18:07.543
Denying ourselves has been as
treacherous for me as it has for you.

18:09.849 --> 18:13.100
- That is what you meant, isn't it?
- You bet.

18:13.270 --> 18:17.398
No. This whole thing just kind of snuck up
on me, that's all.

18:18.734 --> 18:23.728
Well, l won't pretend this hasn't
happened to me before.

18:23.905 --> 18:28.614
Spend any amount of time in a man's
presence and l send out a sort of...

18:28.785 --> 18:34.029
...well, let's face it...erotic signals.

18:39.296 --> 18:42.380
Would you wait here for just a minute?

18:42.549 --> 18:44.589
l need to talk to Carla.

18:45.885 --> 18:51.390
Carla is the person that l usually...
Trust me.

18:52.600 --> 18:55.306
Sam, are you ready
to take me down to that Cape?

18:55.479 --> 19:01.102
- Just one minute.
- What happened? l know it's bad.

19:01.276 --> 19:05.654
Lillian thought l wanted to go out with
her. She's got third-degree Sammies.

19:05.823 --> 19:10.947
- l knew it.
- Don't panic. l can handle this.

19:11.119 --> 19:14.820
We need a solution.
l can always fall back on the truth.

19:14.998 --> 19:20.704
You can't do that. lf you tell her you're
not interested now, she's going to quit.

19:20.879 --> 19:23.833
lf she gets hurt and quits,
l'll be hurt and quit.

19:24.007 --> 19:27.957
lf l get hurt and quit,
then you'll be as good as dead.

19:28.136 --> 19:31.553
What am l going to do?
My mind doesn't work like this.

19:31.723 --> 19:34.345
lt's trained to get women into bed.

19:37.187 --> 19:40.520
- What would Diane do?
- Talk till we puke.

19:40.690 --> 19:43.228
Probably.

19:43.401 --> 19:48.692
l got it. Lillian is smarter than us, right?

19:48.865 --> 19:55.615
You go in there and tell her, ''Lillian, we
can't do this, because...well, you know.''

19:55.789 --> 19:59.454
- No.
- That's what you say.

19:59.626 --> 20:03.078
- She'll fill in the rest.
- That's brilliant.

20:03.255 --> 20:06.339
How does the part go
that l say again? Come on.

20:06.508 --> 20:09.793
''We can't do this,
because...well, you know.''

20:09.970 --> 20:13.670
No, l don't. l wouldn't be asking you
to repeat it if l did.

20:15.725 --> 20:18.975
Right. That's perfect.

20:20.897 --> 20:23.139
Sam, my dear, you're damp.

20:23.316 --> 20:26.103
lt's the sweat of passion.

20:26.277 --> 20:30.489
Lillian, we can't do this because...

20:32.451 --> 20:34.988
...well, you know.

20:35.162 --> 20:40.500
- Yes, l suppose l do.
- You do?

20:41.543 --> 20:44.793
- Sam, why are you dancing?
- l'm just...

20:44.963 --> 20:50.088
l was relieved that l wasn't the only one
who knew why we couldn't do this.

20:50.260 --> 20:53.510
l love this job. l need this job.

20:53.680 --> 20:58.721
Carla needs me so much.
l would miss all these wonderful people.

20:58.893 --> 21:04.812
We must preserve a proper working
relationship no matter what the pain.

21:06.568 --> 21:10.648
lt's sad. l mean, it's so very sad.

21:10.822 --> 21:13.906
Buck up, Sam.
l'm sure it's all for the best.

21:14.075 --> 21:17.574
You're young and not so schooled
in the ways of love as l.

21:17.746 --> 21:24.080
Such a coupling could be fatal. l've
already had two husbands die in bed.

21:26.004 --> 21:29.254
l'm sorry. What did they die of?

21:29.424 --> 21:31.416
You child.

21:33.094 --> 21:34.921
Really?

21:35.138 --> 21:39.800
Yes, they fainted, which all my men do.
But they never came to.

21:41.394 --> 21:45.641
They fainted?
You're saying that that's normal?

21:45.815 --> 21:50.192
Well, l don't want to gloat,
but yes, it has been known.

21:51.654 --> 21:56.031
Were these healthy guys to begin with?

21:57.076 --> 22:01.537
They weren't athletes such as yourself,
but they certainly weren't weaklings.

22:01.706 --> 22:04.197
Why do you ask?

22:04.375 --> 22:07.376
l was just thinking that maybe...

22:08.379 --> 22:11.629
No, you're absolutely right.
Back to work.

22:11.799 --> 22:14.041
We must get back to work, Sam.

22:14.218 --> 22:16.424
l don't want to beat this to death,

22:16.595 --> 22:21.637
but when these guys went,
were they smiling?

22:23.727 --> 22:26.017
Ear to ear.

22:26.189 --> 22:31.693
- And that was the grumpy one.
- l'll be darned.

22:34.238 --> 22:39.659
- So, what happened?
- Everything's OK. l guess.

22:39.827 --> 22:43.576
Sam, are we ever
going to get to this Cape?

22:45.791 --> 22:47.416
Right.

22:47.585 --> 22:50.040
You're taking my daughter sightseeing?

22:50.212 --> 22:56.416
- lf it's OK with you?
- l think it's an absolutely wonderful idea.

22:59.304 --> 23:04.382
Besides, it will take your mind off
what you really want.

23:04.560 --> 23:06.967
Yeah, maybe.

23:07.146 --> 23:13.149
Well, Carolyn, it's just you and me
off to that famous Cape. Here we go.

23:13.319 --> 23:18.313
Do you mind if l ask you
kind of a personal question here?

23:18.491 --> 23:20.531
What's that?

23:20.701 --> 23:23.702
Could you tell me,
how did your father die?

23:25.414 --> 23:28.201
The coroner said it was a heart attack.

23:28.375 --> 23:32.705
But we all know it was
Mummy's passion that killed him.

23:35.340 --> 23:38.128
Well, that's tragic.

23:38.302 --> 23:42.549
Yes. l suppose that's why l hate sex so.

23:45.309 --> 23:48.394
The very idea gives me the chills.

23:48.563 --> 23:50.970
Well, let's go.

23:56.361 --> 23:58.769
Didn't you...
