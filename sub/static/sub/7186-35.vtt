01:03.631 --> 01:07.633
Do you wanna join
my pirate crew?

01:07.635 --> 01:10.436
Great!
To start today's adventure,

01:10.438 --> 01:12.738
everybody say

Make way for me...

delay Her Royal Highness?

02:20.107 --> 02:21.707
[snoring]

02:21.709 --> 02:24.109
[Coralie] You there.

02:24.111 --> 02:27.846
- Hmm?
- Out of my way. Shoo!

02:27.848 --> 02:29.781
I could never forgive myself

02:29.783 --> 02:33.452
if my mermaids didn't
get a chance to bask
in my radiance.

02:33.454 --> 02:36.455
- Mmm.
- There. Much better.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.524
Now away, seahorses.

[snores]

My loyal subjects await
Queen Coralie the Great!

03:10.390 --> 03:13.692
[humming off-key]

03:13.694 --> 03:15.794
No, no, no, no!

03:15.796 --> 03:18.263
Fidgeting flounders,
that will never do.

03:18.265 --> 03:20.465
Let's get it together,
singers.

03:20.467 --> 03:22.534
Yes, Marina.

03:22.536 --> 03:26.305
Queen Coralie doesn't
come here every day.

03:26.307 --> 03:29.274
Everything about
her welcoming pageant
has to be perfect.

03:29.276 --> 03:31.143
Try it again
from the top.

03:31.145 --> 03:35.380
[humming scales]

03:35.382 --> 03:37.049
Smooth sailing.

03:37.051 --> 03:39.484
Now let's see
the synchronized swimmers.

03:39.486 --> 03:41.053
[both giggle]

03:43.456 --> 03:45.991
[both giggle]

03:45.993 --> 03:47.392
Fantastic!

03:47.394 --> 03:50.062
Now where's that
welcoming speech for the queen?

03:50.064 --> 03:52.898
Right here, Marina.
I've just finished
writing it.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.734
It's pretty good,
if I do say so myself.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.436
And we brought her gifts.

03:57.438 --> 04:00.105
Specially picked
from our treasure room.

04:00.107 --> 04:03.875
Wait'll she sees mine.
It's fit for a queen.

04:03.877 --> 04:07.980
Wonderful. All we need now
is for the queen to arrive.

04:12.051 --> 04:13.852
<i>¶ So many fish</i>
<i>in the sea ¶</i>

04:13.854 --> 04:16.188
<i>¶ And I caught me</i>
<i>two or three ¶</i>

04:16.190 --> 04:18.123
<i>¶ And once on a lark</i>
<i>a hammerhead shark ¶</i>

04:18.125 --> 04:20.025
<i>¶ When he was fishing</i>
<i>for me ¶</i>

04:20.027 --> 04:21.727
<i>¶ One catch was worthy</i>
<i>of note ¶</i>

04:21.729 --> 04:23.729
<i>¶ Got a catfish big</i>
<i>as me boat ¶</i>

04:23.731 --> 04:26.131
<i>¶ I pulled him aboard</i>
<i>He chewed up me oars ¶</i>

04:26.133 --> 04:27.966
<i>¶ And I had</i>
<i>to dog paddle home ¶</i>

04:27.968 --> 04:29.768
<i>¶ Oh! </i>

04:29.770 --> 04:33.272
<i>¶ The one that got away is</i>
<i>bigger than any one we got ¶</i>

04:33.274 --> 04:35.507
<i>¶ There's nothing</i>
<i>in the pot for dinner ¶</i>

04:35.509 --> 04:36.975
<i>¶ 'Cause nothing's</i>
<i>what we caught ¶</i>

04:36.977 --> 04:38.277
<i>¶ But we were wishing </i>

04:38.279 --> 04:40.912
<i>¶ We was fishing </i>
<i>on a lazy day ¶</i>

04:40.914 --> 04:43.382
<i>¶ Whatever we find</i>
<i>on the end of the line ¶</i>

04:43.384 --> 04:47.019
<i>¶ Be nothing like</i>
<i>the one that got away ¶</i>

04:47.021 --> 04:49.187
[Sharky] Thunderation!

04:49.189 --> 04:51.490
Now we're cooking. Ha-har!

04:51.492 --> 04:54.826
[grunting]

04:54.828 --> 04:57.896
[Shraky]
Whoa! It must be a whale.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.564
Or a really big shrimp.

04:59.566 --> 05:01.300
I beg your pardon.

05:01.302 --> 05:04.936
[gasps]
Y-Y-You're no shrimp.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.738
What insolence!

05:06.740 --> 05:10.375
How dare you speak that way
to Queen Coralie,

05:10.377 --> 05:13.612
ruler of the mermaids
and empress of the Never Sea.

05:13.614 --> 05:16.548
But I thought you
was a fairytale legend.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.417
I am a legend.

05:18.419 --> 05:20.819
A living,
swimming, singing one.

05:20.821 --> 05:26.091
Oi! I'm bedazzled
by your magnificence, I am.

05:26.093 --> 05:30.395
I'm tired of waiting, Smee.
Where's my dinner?

05:30.397 --> 05:32.798
What's this?

05:32.800 --> 05:34.599
And now my little
two-leggers,

05:34.601 --> 05:37.202
you may help me off
this dingy dinghy.

05:37.204 --> 05:38.737
I'm late for an appointment.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.238
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Right away, Your Highness.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.674
Not so fast, boys.

05:42.676 --> 05:46.712
Methinks this royal she-fish
will be staying.

05:46.714 --> 05:49.448
And who is this
annoying mammal?

05:49.450 --> 05:51.616
I am Captain James Hook,

05:51.618 --> 05:55.387
the famous pirate
extraordinaire.

05:55.389 --> 05:59.191
Captain Hoop?
Never heard of you.

05:59.193 --> 06:02.594
Hook.
Me name is Hook.

06:02.596 --> 06:05.997
Now as much as I like
all this attention,

06:05.999 --> 06:07.499
I must be going.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.868
You're going nowhere.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.570
You see,

06:11.572 --> 06:16.141
a mermaid queen is
a rare treasure indeed.

06:18.077 --> 06:20.645
[laughing]

06:20.647 --> 06:24.116
[wincing]

06:24.118 --> 06:26.885
That's enough, everyone.
We don't want to over-practice.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.788
Marina, where's the queen?

06:29.790 --> 06:32.524
I don't know.
She should be here by now.

06:32.526 --> 06:34.559
I'm really getting worried.

06:34.561 --> 06:38.029
[seahorses whinnying]

06:38.031 --> 06:40.432
[Marina]
Oh! There's
the queen's chariot.

06:40.434 --> 06:43.368
If that's
the queen's chariot,

06:43.370 --> 06:45.170
where's the queen?

06:46.606 --> 06:48.640
Look, there's a note.

06:48.642 --> 06:52.677
"Be it known that Queen Coralie
is being held prisoner."

06:52.679 --> 06:53.945
[gasping]

06:53.947 --> 06:56.681
"She will be set free
only after the mermaids

06:56.683 --> 07:00.719
give all of the queen's
royal treasures to me,
Captain Hook!"

07:00.721 --> 07:02.921
Yay-hey, no way!

07:02.923 --> 07:06.525
I'll say.
You can't trust hook
to let the queen go,

07:06.527 --> 07:08.860
even if he does get
what he wants.

07:08.862 --> 07:13.432
Oh, this is a sad, sad day
for all the mermaids.

07:13.434 --> 07:14.900
Don't you worry.

07:14.902 --> 07:17.235
Me and my mateys know
how to handle the captain.

07:17.237 --> 07:18.503
We'll go talk to him.

07:18.505 --> 07:20.338
Mateys, will you help us

07:20.340 --> 07:22.808
rescue Queen Coralie
from Captain Hook?

07:24.577 --> 07:28.313
Great! Keep a lookout
for gold doubloons.

07:28.315 --> 07:31.783
Whenever we solve
a pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.986
Then we'll collect 'em and put
'em in our Team Treasure Chest.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.022
Yo-ho, let's go!

07:37.024 --> 07:38.790
Is everybody ready?

07:38.792 --> 07:40.459
I got my sword.

07:40.461 --> 07:41.860
I got my map.

07:41.862 --> 07:44.262
And I've got my pixie dust.

07:44.264 --> 07:47.566
The fairies gave it to me
so that we can use it to fly,

07:47.568 --> 07:49.668
but only in emergencies.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.169
How can we help?

07:51.171 --> 07:53.872
You stay here and keep an eye
on the royal treasure,

07:53.874 --> 07:57.409
just in case Hook has
another trick up his sleeve.

07:57.411 --> 08:00.345
[both]
Aye-aye, Jake.

08:04.584 --> 08:07.152
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away </i>

08:07.154 --> 08:10.055
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

08:10.057 --> 08:11.356
Let's go!

08:11.358 --> 08:14.860
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

08:14.862 --> 08:17.496
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

08:17.498 --> 08:19.331
<i>¶ And me </i>

08:22.235 --> 08:24.703
[Coralie] Oh, please.
You can't be serious.

08:24.705 --> 08:27.339
But this is
the best room on the ship.

08:27.341 --> 08:30.842
We are trying to make you
comfortable, Your Majesty.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.044
By the beard of Neptune,

08:33.046 --> 08:36.681
how can I be comfortable
locked away in a dungeon?

08:36.683 --> 08:40.819
Well, I'm afraid the captain
says you must stay here,

08:40.821 --> 08:43.522
but I brought you
fresh strawberries.

08:43.524 --> 08:47.292
What in blasted blue blazes
is going on in here?

08:47.294 --> 08:51.496
We're trying to make
Her Majesty comfy.

08:51.498 --> 08:54.466
And provide her
with a few bare necessities.

08:54.468 --> 08:55.300
[blows]

08:55.302 --> 08:57.435
What are you thinking?

08:57.437 --> 09:00.639
You men are pirates,
not handmaidens.

09:00.641 --> 09:03.942
I may be your prisoner,
Captain Hoof,

09:03.944 --> 09:06.111
but I remain a queen.

09:06.113 --> 09:10.115
It seems your men, unlike you,
know how to treat one.

09:10.117 --> 09:12.617
- Can I get you a pillow?
- Would you like
something to read?

09:12.619 --> 09:13.919
Can I make you soup?

09:13.921 --> 09:17.856
Agh! Keeping that water-logged
fish-woman is too much work.

09:17.858 --> 09:20.892
I should have demanded
a bigger treasure
for her freedom.

09:20.894 --> 09:24.229
[Jake]
Ahoy! Jolly Roger, ho!

09:24.231 --> 09:25.964
Is that the puny pirates?

09:25.966 --> 09:27.933
Perhaps they
brought me treasure.

09:27.935 --> 09:31.202
Quick men,
all hands on deck.

09:32.705 --> 09:34.406
Did someone mention soup?

09:34.408 --> 09:36.641
You there, pirate pests!

09:36.643 --> 09:40.946
Have you brought
the treasure to exchange
for the Mermaid Queen?

09:40.948 --> 09:43.048
No treasure
for you, Hook.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.784
No treasure, no queen.

09:45.786 --> 09:48.153
Let her go now!

09:48.155 --> 09:50.889
Oh, I have
a much better idea.

09:50.891 --> 09:53.525
Men, release the...

09:53.527 --> 09:56.227
Barnacles!
Where is everyone?

09:56.229 --> 09:59.965
[Smee laughing]
More soup, Your Majesty?

09:59.967 --> 10:02.634
Blast that selfish she-fish.

10:02.636 --> 10:06.037
Must I do everything meself?

10:06.039 --> 10:09.774
Release the hammerhead.

10:09.776 --> 10:12.344
[chuckles]

10:12.346 --> 10:16.281
Happy hammering,
me proud beauty!
[cackling]

10:17.683 --> 10:20.952
Crashing crackers,
hammerhead, ho!

10:20.954 --> 10:23.822
And it looks like
he's in a hurry.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.690
[Izzy]
Shiver me timbers!

10:25.692 --> 10:28.793
A Hammerhead's noggin
is as hard as a hammer.

10:28.795 --> 10:33.031
And there's nothing
that big fish likes better
than pounding on ships.

10:33.033 --> 10:36.267
- What are we gonna do?
- I know.

10:36.269 --> 10:38.870
Dive, Bucky, dive!

10:45.544 --> 10:49.814
[Jake]
OK, Bucky. Now let's give
Mr. Hardhead the slip.

10:51.250 --> 10:53.718
[laughing]

11:00.126 --> 11:01.726
Shimmering sharkskin!

11:01.728 --> 11:04.496
That hammering hothead
is closing in.

11:04.498 --> 11:06.665
[Jake]
Bucky, head for that shipwreck.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.299
Full speed ahead!

11:08.301 --> 11:11.236
[laughing]

11:14.540 --> 11:16.841
[laughs]

11:16.843 --> 11:19.210
That big wreck should
keep Mr. Hammerhead

11:19.212 --> 11:21.880
happily hammering for hours.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.316
[horn blows]

11:27.186 --> 11:28.987
Way to go, mateys.

11:28.989 --> 11:31.022
For escaping
from the hammerhead,

11:31.024 --> 11:32.991
we got three gold doubloons.

11:32.993 --> 11:35.060
Let's grab 'em and go.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.795
Look alive, me hearties.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.963
Ol' Feather Hat's
on the run.

11:38.965 --> 11:42.333
Then yo-ho-ho,
after him we go!

11:46.038 --> 11:49.107
[Coralie]
Captain Hog,
please inform your men

11:49.109 --> 11:53.144
they are carrying a queen,
not a kettle of fish.

11:53.146 --> 11:56.981
Oh! Is there no end
to your complaining?

11:56.983 --> 12:00.318
Here we are,
my High-Maintenance Highness.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.520
Your new home away from home.

12:02.522 --> 12:04.823
What a horrid place.

12:04.825 --> 12:07.125
Still,
anywhere has to be better

12:07.127 --> 12:10.562
than your itty-bitty boat,
Captain Heel.

12:10.564 --> 12:13.898
Hook. Hook.
The name is Hook!

12:13.900 --> 12:17.302
Well, now isn't this cozy?

12:17.304 --> 12:20.338
But don't be getting
too settled.

12:20.340 --> 12:24.309
You're only here
until all your treasure
is turned over to me.

12:24.311 --> 12:28.613
The Never Sea will dry up
before that happens,
Captain Hoot.

12:28.615 --> 12:32.217
It's Hook.
H-double-O-K, Hoop.

12:32.219 --> 12:33.752
I mean Hoot.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.487
I mean Hook.

12:35.489 --> 12:37.756
[sighs] This carping queen

12:37.758 --> 12:40.024
has given me
a king-sized headache.

12:40.026 --> 12:41.793
I'm going to lie down for a bit.

12:41.795 --> 12:44.596
And, men,
no more fussing over her.

12:44.598 --> 12:47.265
She's spoiled enough
as it is.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.701
I don't know which I find
more dismal:

12:49.703 --> 12:51.436
this cave or your captain.

12:51.438 --> 12:54.939
Oh, it isn't
very cheery here, is it?

12:54.941 --> 12:56.775
And the captain
is making it worse.

12:56.777 --> 12:59.210
He put booby traps
all around.

12:59.212 --> 13:02.547
Oh, how I wish
I were safe in my palace.

13:02.549 --> 13:06.451
Or anywhere
in Neptune City.

13:06.453 --> 13:09.420
Oh, Neptune City.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.856
The home of the mermaids.

13:11.858 --> 13:14.726
<i>¶ If you've never</i>
<i>seen a sunrise ¶</i>

13:14.728 --> 13:17.529
<i>¶ From the bottom</i>
<i>of the sea ¶</i>

13:17.531 --> 13:20.098
<i>¶ Then you've never</i>
<i>seen a sunrise ¶</i>

13:20.100 --> 13:23.368
<i>¶ The way</i>
<i>it's meant to be ¶</i>

13:23.370 --> 13:25.837
<i>¶ Shimmering and wonderful </i>

13:25.839 --> 13:28.640
<i>¶ The waves above of gold </i>

13:28.642 --> 13:33.711
<i>¶ Over my underwater home </i>

13:36.615 --> 13:39.017
<i>¶ In a Neptune City sunrise </i>

13:39.019 --> 13:41.486
<i>¶ You're swimming</i>
<i>in sunlight ¶</i>

13:41.488 --> 13:44.155
<i>¶ With gemstone-covered</i>
<i>coral castles</i>

13:44.157 --> 13:45.490
<i>¶ Dazzling and bright </i>

13:45.492 --> 13:48.026
<i>¶ In the sun rays</i>
<i>turtles play ¶</i>

13:48.028 --> 13:50.995
<i>¶ As the mermaids</i>
<i>sing all day ¶</i>

13:50.997 --> 13:55.433
<i>¶ Neptune City sunrise </i>

13:55.435 --> 14:00.004
<i>¶ Until you've seen the glow </i>

14:00.006 --> 14:04.809
<i>¶ Of the sunrise</i>
<i>from below ¶</i>

14:04.811 --> 14:07.412
<i>¶ You'll never know </i>

14:07.414 --> 14:11.115
<i>¶ How beautiful </i>

14:11.117 --> 14:14.953
<i>¶ It could be </i>

14:14.955 --> 14:17.388
<i>¶ I wish I could see </i>

14:17.390 --> 14:19.257
<i>¶ Turtles swimming free </i>

14:19.259 --> 14:22.126
¶ If only we could be

14:22.128 --> 14:24.963
<i>¶ Underneath the sea </i>

14:26.365 --> 14:30.201
It sounds beautiful.

14:30.936 --> 14:32.270
[Jake] Good eye, Skully.

14:32.272 --> 14:34.038
If you hadn't spotted
the    <i>Jolly Roger,</i>

14:34.040 --> 14:35.940
we would have never
found this cave.

14:35.942 --> 14:39.944
Or heard the song.
And that's a mermaid singing.

14:39.946 --> 14:41.512
I just know it.

14:41.514 --> 14:44.582
Hook must be hiding
Queen Coralie inside.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.284
We've gotta save her.

14:46.286 --> 14:47.719
Hold on, mateys.

14:47.721 --> 14:50.555
If I know Hook,
he's set out booby traps.

14:50.557 --> 14:51.956
Keep your eyes peeled.

14:51.958 --> 14:54.659
Uh-oh.

14:56.929 --> 14:58.329
Stand back!

15:03.469 --> 15:05.670
Aw, coconuts.

15:05.672 --> 15:09.140
That's Hook putting out
the welcome mat, all right.

15:09.142 --> 15:11.309
[snoring]

15:13.512 --> 15:15.146
[gasps]

15:15.148 --> 15:16.147
[shivers]

15:16.149 --> 15:20.151
Mr. Smee,
bring me my blankey.

15:20.153 --> 15:22.086
I'm freezing.

15:23.022 --> 15:26.824
Smee!
Where is that loopy lout?

15:26.826 --> 15:30.328
My... hooks!

15:30.330 --> 15:33.364
Smee, what is all this?

15:33.366 --> 15:35.733
Well, you see, sir,

15:35.735 --> 15:37.969
I thought the place could
use some brightening,

15:37.971 --> 15:39.704
and the only thing
we had was...

15:39.706 --> 15:41.139
Me hooks!

15:41.141 --> 15:44.242
Captain Heap,
the decorations are my idea.

15:44.244 --> 15:47.812
If there's a problem,
kindly address it to me.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.580
Oh, fine.

15:49.582 --> 15:53.418
The problem is all this
rude and selfish behavior.

15:53.420 --> 15:58.289
Well, Captain Hock,
if the tiara fits, wear it.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.458
Oh!

16:00.460 --> 16:05.063
Mateys, here's how we can
get past these pointy rocks:

16:05.065 --> 16:09.767
We can use this seaweed like
a lasso and bring them down.

16:09.769 --> 16:13.371
Yo-ho, let's go
save the queen.

16:13.373 --> 16:16.874
Yahoo!

16:19.011 --> 16:20.611
Now we pull.

16:20.613 --> 16:24.816
Heave ho! Heave ho!

16:24.818 --> 16:26.985
Heave ho!

16:29.788 --> 16:31.389
All right!

16:31.391 --> 16:32.657
For clearing the way,

16:32.659 --> 16:35.426
we got three more
gold doubloons.

16:35.428 --> 16:38.830
Let's grab 'em
and go save the queen.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.333
And furthermore,
Captain Hump,

16:42.335 --> 16:46.237
it's greedy sea slugs like you
that give pirates a bad name.

16:46.239 --> 16:50.041
Oh, how I wish I'd tossed you
back into the Never Sea

16:50.043 --> 16:52.110
when first
I laid eyes on you.

16:52.112 --> 16:55.613
Captain Hook, we're here
to take Queen Coralie

16:55.615 --> 16:57.882
to a welcoming party
in her honor.

16:57.884 --> 17:00.952
Oh. You must be my rescuers.

17:00.954 --> 17:03.154
Now hand over
the queen, please.

17:03.156 --> 17:05.623
Splendid.
She's all yours.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.459
It would be worth
every treasure on Never Land

17:08.461 --> 17:10.228
to get rid of her.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.296
Take her away.
Quickly.

17:12.298 --> 17:15.333
It's gotta be a trap.
What do we do?

17:15.335 --> 17:17.301
We can't trust him.

17:17.303 --> 17:21.039
Well, I did overhear
some blather about booby traps.

17:21.041 --> 17:23.107
Stay where you are,
Your Majesty.

17:23.109 --> 17:25.543
Hook couldn't have put
booby traps everywhere.

17:25.545 --> 17:29.047
We'll go around
to the back and get her.

17:30.315 --> 17:33.418
No, no. This is where I
really did put a booby trap

17:33.420 --> 17:36.687
in case somebody tried
to sneak in from the back.

17:36.689 --> 17:39.991
Look, there's
a wire right here.

17:39.993 --> 17:43.294
It's hard to see
and if someone should
step on it,

17:43.296 --> 17:44.962
like this...

17:52.037 --> 17:53.905
[screams]

17:53.907 --> 17:57.341
Abandon cave.
Smee. Sharky. Bones.

17:57.343 --> 17:59.410
Gather up me hooks.

17:59.412 --> 18:02.747
- Izzy, this is...
- An emergency.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.116
Pixie dust away!

18:05.118 --> 18:08.286
Now let's save the queen.

18:10.289 --> 18:11.856
This way.

18:14.059 --> 18:16.127
Get out while you can, Hook.

18:16.129 --> 18:19.464
Not until I have
all me precious hooks.

18:19.466 --> 18:21.866
Come on, Jake. Hurry!

18:21.868 --> 18:24.669
Move it, men. Run!

18:25.671 --> 18:28.239
[Izzy] Way-hey!
We rescued the queen

18:28.241 --> 18:31.142
and got
three more gold doubloons.

18:31.144 --> 18:33.811
Let's grab 'em and... go.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.748
But what about...

18:37.750 --> 18:39.584
Your Majesty,
we really should...

18:39.586 --> 18:40.818
Yes, yes, I know.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.254
That sorry man
may be horrible,

18:43.256 --> 18:44.689
but we can't
leave him to suffer.

18:44.691 --> 18:47.425
We must help
others in need.

18:47.427 --> 18:50.094
Ah, that piece of wood
might do the trick.

18:50.096 --> 18:52.563
[screaming]

18:54.366 --> 18:55.566
That should do it.

18:55.568 --> 18:58.302
Sometimes even a queen
must get her fins dirty.

18:58.304 --> 19:02.073
Now back to the Never Sea.
My subjects await.

19:02.075 --> 19:04.609
Beg your pardon,
royal ma'am.

19:04.611 --> 19:08.146
Before you go, Captain Hook
has something to say to you.

19:08.148 --> 19:10.715
I... I do?

19:10.717 --> 19:12.650
You certainly do, Captain.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.119
Queen Coralie
came back to help you,

19:15.121 --> 19:17.822
even after all
you put her through.

19:17.824 --> 19:22.426
Well, Your Majesty...

19:22.428 --> 19:26.531
thank you for lending
a fin and helping.

19:26.533 --> 19:28.232
And?

19:28.234 --> 19:30.601
And I'm sorry
for keeping you a prisoner.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.003
There. I said it.

19:32.005 --> 19:34.906
I, the great Queen Coralie,

19:34.908 --> 19:38.509
forgive you,
Captain Hook.

19:38.511 --> 19:41.846
Now we must away
to Hidden Cove.

19:41.848 --> 19:44.949
I'm very late for a very
important engagement.

19:44.951 --> 19:47.018
She... She...

19:47.020 --> 19:49.453
She got my name right.

19:51.623 --> 19:52.924
<i>¶ We welcome you </i>

19:52.926 --> 19:56.928
<i>¶ Ol' Mermaid Majesty </i>

19:56.930 --> 20:00.631
<i>¶ Hail to our Queen Coralie </i>

20:00.633 --> 20:05.002
<i>¶ Welcome</i>
<i>Queen Coralie the Great ¶</i>

20:05.004 --> 20:07.138
<i>¶ Royal Highness </i>

20:07.140 --> 20:10.441
<i>¶ Of the Never Sea </i>

20:10.443 --> 20:14.312
<i>¶ Welcome</i>
<i>Queen Coralie the Great ¶</i>

20:14.314 --> 20:19.083
<i>¶ No one could ever be</i>
<i>more welcome here than she ¶</i>

20:19.085 --> 20:23.054
<i>¶ Our Mermaid Queen Coralie </i>

20:25.524 --> 20:28.192
Bravo! Wonderfish!

20:28.194 --> 20:30.728
Thank you, Your Majesty.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.463
Yeah, thank you.

20:32.465 --> 20:36.867
If I had legs, I'd give you
a standing ovation.

20:36.869 --> 20:41.405
Ahem, Your Highness, on behalf
of all of your loyal subjects

20:41.407 --> 20:43.641
and your friends
from around the Never Sea,

20:43.643 --> 20:45.476
I offer you welcome.

20:45.478 --> 20:48.012
And we bring you
these gifts.

20:48.014 --> 20:51.415
You brave young pirates
have already given me

20:51.417 --> 20:54.085
the greatest gift
of all... my freedom,

20:54.087 --> 20:57.054
but I, too, have gifts for you.

20:58.657 --> 21:01.292
Jake, Izzy, Cubby

21:01.294 --> 21:02.727
and Skully.

21:02.729 --> 21:05.863
For proving yourselves
brave and resourceful,

21:05.865 --> 21:08.599
it gives me
great pleasure to name you

21:08.601 --> 21:10.768
Honorary Royal Guards.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.571
Let it be known
far and wide

21:13.573 --> 21:17.074
that these noble young pirates
have earned the respect

21:17.076 --> 21:21.212
and gratitude
of the Mermaid Queen.

21:21.214 --> 21:23.347
And we all know
that ain't easy.

21:25.817 --> 21:29.353
Thanks for helping us rescue
Queen Coralie, mateys.

21:29.355 --> 21:31.289
Now let's put
all our gold doubloons

21:31.291 --> 21:33.457
into our Team Treasure Chest.

21:40.866 --> 21:42.867
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

21:42.869 --> 21:45.202
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

21:45.204 --> 21:46.937
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>With help from you ¶</i>

21:46.939 --> 21:49.807
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

21:49.809 --> 21:52.243
Come on, count with us.

21:52.744 --> 21:54.745
[all] Yeah!

21:54.747 --> 21:58.649
[Jake]
One, two, three.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.951
[Cubby]
Four, five, six.

22:00.953 --> 22:03.120
[Izzy]
Seven, eight, nine.

22:03.122 --> 22:06.691
[Jake]
Yo-ho! For solving
pirate problems today,

22:06.693 --> 22:10.394
we got nine gold doubloons.

22:10.396 --> 22:14.498
Crackers! I never did get
to give my gift to the queen.

22:14.500 --> 22:17.668
She would have loved it.

22:17.670 --> 22:20.571
Crackers! [laughs]

22:20.573 --> 22:23.341
[all laughing]

22:26.244 --> 22:28.913
[sighs] Who'd ever thought

22:28.915 --> 22:33.417
a scruffy ol' sea salt like me
would get to meet royalty?

22:33.419 --> 22:36.721
[sighs]
She's ever so lovely.

22:36.723 --> 22:39.924
[sighs] Her hands
are dainty and smooth

22:39.926 --> 22:42.159
as a baby squid's bottom.

22:42.161 --> 22:45.463
Quit that mooning
and on your feet, men.

22:45.465 --> 22:47.565
- Back to work...
- [loud bang]

22:47.567 --> 22:50.801
Oh, no!

22:50.803 --> 22:54.071
A hammerhead.
[laughing]

22:57.976 --> 23:01.679
[Hook] Boys, save me!

23:01.681 --> 23:03.581
[all sigh]

gold doubloons ¶

23:28.508 --> 23:30.908
