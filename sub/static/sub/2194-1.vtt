to make your butt smaller.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.056
77 best-loved cooking recipes.

00:15.599 --> 00:18.398
Big, fat, ugly butt.

00:18.894 --> 00:20.567
The possession of willpower
and self-discipline

00:20.646 --> 00:21.989
can be the factor
leading to success.

00:22.064 --> 00:23.566
Useless bitch. 88 lbs.

00:23.690 --> 00:24.691
You're disgusting,
do you know that?

00:24.775 --> 00:25.822
Focus on your goal.

00:25.901 --> 00:27.744
Sensitivity or allergy
can reduce...

00:28.487 --> 00:30.364
God, I hate poor people...
in the body.

00:30.614 --> 00:33.208
What is your problem?!
Hair is your crowning glory.

00:33.283 --> 00:34.375
If you've got it...
Fuck you!

00:34.451 --> 00:36.078
Then style it in a way
that flatters your face

00:36.161 --> 00:38.414
and choose a great color
if you don't like your own.

00:38.705 --> 00:41.049
If you want to, try some
teeth-whitening solutions.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.628
Teen-dating abuse and violence
is happening everywhere.

00:44.086 --> 00:45.178
Take risks. Fat bitch.

00:45.254 --> 00:46.676
Step out of your comfort zone.

00:46.797 --> 00:48.799
Successful people
think big and act big.

00:49.925 --> 00:51.017
Why men pull away.

00:51.093 --> 00:53.767
Remember that success
does not guarantee happiness.

00:53.845 --> 00:55.939
Accept life is unfair.
Are my hips normal?

00:56.056 --> 00:57.729
Accept life is unfair.

00:57.808 --> 00:59.981
Fact. Eggs can live...
Don't give up.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.858
If you don't give up,
you can't fail.

01:01.979 --> 01:03.697
You can't fail. You can't fail.
You can't fail.

02:47.042 --> 02:50.421
Oh, right. Hi.
Which one are you?

02:50.504 --> 02:52.802
- Isaac.
- No one calls me Elizabeth.

02:52.923 --> 02:54.721
Except my dad,
and he's an asshole.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.848
So if you don't mind,
my name's Daisy.

02:57.469 --> 02:59.563
Daisy, great.

03:00.180 --> 03:03.775
- Where's your mom?
- Working. Um, she sent me.

03:04.059 --> 03:05.732
Do you want me to take that?

03:05.811 --> 03:06.903
Why?

03:07.020 --> 03:09.398
Well, I don't know.
it... It might be heavy.

03:09.606 --> 03:11.279
Yeah, it is heavy.

03:12.442 --> 03:13.910
Okay.

03:13.985 --> 03:15.453
Well, um, we should...

03:15.529 --> 03:17.327
we should probably go
to the car.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.909
Yeah, sure.
Let's go to the car.

03:23.453 --> 03:25.080
high security.
Please remain vigilant.

03:25.163 --> 03:26.915
Report any suspicious behavior

03:26.998 --> 03:29.126
immediately
to security personnel.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.509
Where are you taking me?

03:32.587 --> 03:35.056
Oh, they charge 15 quid
for half an hour's parking.

03:35.173 --> 03:37.016
Sod that.

03:38.593 --> 03:40.140
Jesus.

03:40.262 --> 03:41.935
It's just down here.

03:46.268 --> 03:47.440
Ow!

03:49.479 --> 03:52.278
Here, I'll put it in the car.

03:54.443 --> 03:55.820
What age are you?

03:56.236 --> 03:57.988
- 14.
- 14?

03:58.155 --> 03:59.452
You've got a license?

03:59.531 --> 04:01.625
No, but I've been driving
since I was six.

04:03.000 --> 04:09.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

04:10.959 --> 04:13.257
You expect me to get in this
thing? With you?

04:13.336 --> 04:15.589
Well, you could get a bus
if you'd rather.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.428
Fine yeah, I would.

04:17.548 --> 04:18.846
It does take
about eight hours though.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.435
And the next one's
not due until 11:00...

04:22.596 --> 04:24.815
tomorrow morning.

04:28.977 --> 04:29.978
Welcome, by the way...

04:30.061 --> 04:31.153
Uh-huh.

04:31.229 --> 04:32.230
to England.

04:32.314 --> 04:33.281
Shit!

04:33.356 --> 04:34.573
Careful!

04:34.941 --> 04:36.659
Jesus Christ.

04:36.735 --> 04:40.330
Sorry. I'm better
when there's no cars around.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.633
So are you gonna stay with us
for the whole summer?

04:51.917 --> 04:53.009
What, I just got here.

04:53.084 --> 04:54.666
You want to get
rid of me already?

04:54.669 --> 04:55.761
No, no, no, not at all.

04:55.879 --> 04:57.176
We've been really looking
forward to meeting you.

04:57.380 --> 04:58.506
Piper especially.
She's the only girl

04:58.590 --> 05:00.934
most of the time,
and you're our only cousin.

05:01.009 --> 05:02.932
So you're gonna be like
a guest of honor.

05:06.014 --> 05:08.233
Road!

05:08.433 --> 05:10.527
Yeah well,
just so you know

05:10.644 --> 05:12.317
I'm not one of those
stupid yanks who's gonna

05:12.395 --> 05:14.773
kiss your ass the whole time
because you're British, okay?

05:16.024 --> 05:17.571
- Okay.
- Okay.

05:17.818 --> 05:20.662
Have we bonded now?
Can we just shut up and drive?

05:21.196 --> 05:22.789
Yeah. Um, well,

05:22.948 --> 05:25.246

06:39.232 --> 06:40.449
Push 'em away, Daisy.
They'll be fine.

06:40.525 --> 06:41.902
- Jet! Get down!
- Go... get off of me!

06:44.029 --> 06:45.497

06:45.655 --> 06:48.454

06:48.617 --> 06:50.540
Get off, Jet! Get down!

06:50.619 --> 06:51.996
Ugh, move!

06:52.078 --> 06:53.295
Come here.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.127
Jet, back!

06:58.835 --> 07:01.304
Are you okay?

07:01.546 --> 07:03.298
Allergy to wheat can produce

07:03.381 --> 07:04.473
a variety of symptoms.

07:04.549 --> 07:05.675
How to be...
fucking loser, fucking loser.

07:05.842 --> 07:06.889
Sorry about the dogs.

07:06.968 --> 07:08.060
They just... they just
get overexcited.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.146
Hey, wait a second.

07:12.390 --> 07:14.313
- Who is that?
- Edmond.

07:14.601 --> 07:17.195
- Edmond?
- He's the oldest.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.567
And this is Piper.

07:18.647 --> 07:20.024
She's our baby.

07:20.148 --> 07:21.946
I'm not a baby!

07:22.609 --> 07:25.408
Elizabeth, would you
like to see my unicorn?

07:25.528 --> 07:27.826
- Um, probably not.
- Piper, leave her alone.

07:27.989 --> 07:29.864
- Elizabeth, you're American.
- It's Daisy.

07:29.865 --> 07:32.085
No one calls me Elizabeth.
And if you don't mind,

07:32.202 --> 07:34.079
what I'd really like
to see is my room.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.082
I need to wash my hands,
like, right now.

07:37.248 --> 07:39.501
I've got some kind
of canine S.T.D.

07:40.251 --> 07:41.969
I'll take that.

07:48.051 --> 07:50.145
Oh hey.
This is Joe.

07:50.428 --> 07:51.395
Hi.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.597
He's our next-door neighbor.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.144
Well, sort of.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.101
But he lives with us
as much as he can.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.687
That was his dog, Gin.

07:58.895 --> 08:01.114
No, come back.

08:01.189 --> 08:03.442
- Bless you.
- Hey, do you want a drink?

08:03.942 --> 08:04.984
No.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.454
And you can wash your hands
in the sink if you want.

08:07.570 --> 08:10.119
- Mom! She's here!
- Piper, leave her.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.701
- It's not time.
- Is your mom out or...?

08:12.702 --> 08:14.453
No, she's in her study.

08:14.536 --> 08:16.129
We don't usually see her
before 9:00.

08:16.204 --> 08:19.083
She's an expert
in loony extremists.

08:19.582 --> 08:22.335
- She's going to save the world.
- Piper, shut up.

08:22.627 --> 08:26.427
- Take cousin Daisy to her room.
- Come on, cousin Daisy.

08:26.548 --> 08:29.142
I need to give you
the grand tour of the house.

08:33.013 --> 08:36.859
This is my unicorn
I was telling you about.

08:37.142 --> 08:39.986
Shh, that's mommy's office.

08:40.311 --> 08:43.440
Now we will come
up the stairs.

08:45.108 --> 08:47.987
That's the junk room
that Joe sleeps in sometimes

08:48.111 --> 08:49.829
when his dad's being a wanker.

08:50.071 --> 08:52.244
I know what a wanker is,
by the way.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.376
And in here is your room.

08:56.036 --> 08:59.290
You've so got the best
bed in the house.

08:59.998 --> 09:01.625
Uh-huh.

09:11.176 --> 09:12.974
Well, I think my dad's

09:13.053 --> 09:15.272
probably trying to get
through to me, so...

09:17.348 --> 09:19.726
I'd kind of like
to yell at him in private.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.489
So can you leave?

09:24.647 --> 09:26.115
Now, please?

09:26.357 --> 09:27.825
All right.

09:29.444 --> 09:30.616
Can I get you a cup of tea?

09:30.779 --> 09:33.123
No thanks.

09:56.387 --> 09:58.685
Glamorous, confident girl.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.689
I hope you get killed.
Dumb baby, dumb baby.

10:02.393 --> 10:03.895
Stop slouching.

10:03.978 --> 10:06.401
Avoid self-pity.

10:06.481 --> 10:08.575
Itching, rashes, watery eyes,

10:08.650 --> 10:11.403
watery eyes, watery eyes...

10:36.386 --> 10:37.603
What do you
wanna do today, man?

10:37.720 --> 10:40.018
Don't really mind.

10:40.265 --> 10:42.438
- I wanna go fishing.
- Mmm.

10:42.517 --> 10:45.066
- Go and get some fish, man.
- Hey.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.113
Cousin Daisy at last!

10:47.188 --> 10:49.236
We thought you'd never get up.

10:49.315 --> 10:50.988
Morning.
Sit wherever you like.

10:51.109 --> 10:53.612
We've made enough for about
a thousand people.

10:53.695 --> 10:56.118
Mom has an emergency meeting
in London.

10:56.197 --> 10:58.416
She said she's sorry,
and she'll see you this evening.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.334
There's going to be
a World War Ill.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.629
No, there isn't.
Stop being a dick,

11:02.704 --> 11:03.705
and get Daisy something to eat.

11:03.788 --> 11:04.914
I'm not a dick!

11:04.998 --> 11:06.921
- I'm actually not that hungry.
- Dick dick dick.

11:08.042 --> 11:10.136
All right, Jet, I'm doing it.

11:10.211 --> 11:11.463
We let you sleep in.

11:11.546 --> 11:13.139
Eddie said you needed
to catch up on some rest.

11:13.214 --> 11:16.343
- Did he?
- Are you a vampire?

11:16.551 --> 11:18.394
No.

11:18.469 --> 11:20.312
How much
dead animal do you want?

11:20.388 --> 11:21.856
I'm really not hungry.

11:22.223 --> 11:23.691
If you want,
I can make you a sandwich.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.234
We've got some
really nice cheese.

11:25.310 --> 11:27.563
No. I don't do wheat
or cow cheese.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.815
- Cow cheese?
- Knob cheese.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.275
Why don't you eat cow cheese?

11:32.358 --> 11:35.032
Because it's basically
solidified cow mucus.

11:36.487 --> 11:38.910
It stays in your gut
for like five years.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.535
Morning.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.416
Morning.

11:45.455 --> 11:47.082
Did you get
through to your dad?

11:47.165 --> 11:48.883
Yeah. He's fine.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.963
Actually, Isaac, could you pass
me the water, please?

11:56.758 --> 11:59.056
At least eight
glasses of water a day.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.229
Mom said she'd call him
as soon as she can.

12:01.387 --> 12:02.513
Let him know you arrived safely
and all.

12:02.514 --> 12:03.605
No, that's fine.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.101
He said not to bother.

12:06.184 --> 12:10.234
He's kind of busy with work
and the new baby, so...

12:10.313 --> 12:11.439
Increasing the supply

12:11.522 --> 12:12.819
of the brain hormone...

12:12.899 --> 12:15.493
Hey.

12:16.611 --> 12:19.239
Have you got something
to say to me?

12:20.156 --> 12:22.284
What are you looking at?

12:34.128 --> 12:36.222
What was that all about?

12:39.092 --> 12:41.311
It should be
taken once a day with water.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.563
Stay away from distractions,

12:47.642 --> 12:49.861
distractions,
distractions, distractions.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.654
Step out of your comfort zone.

12:51.729 --> 12:53.402
Successful people think...

12:54.440 --> 12:56.283
Who is it?

12:58.403 --> 13:01.703
Uh, we're going fishing,
if you wanna come.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.662
I don't fish.

13:26.014 --> 13:27.982
Ugh, gross!

13:28.057 --> 13:30.810
<i>♪ You've got me in a headlock, darling ♪</i>

13:30.935 --> 13:33.313
<i>♪ And I don't know how to breathe ♪</i>

13:33.855 --> 13:36.108
<i>♪ You've turned me upside down... ♪</i>

14:42.840 --> 14:44.763
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go!

14:44.842 --> 14:46.264
Come on, move!

14:46.344 --> 14:48.221
You can't have the fish.
No, you can't.

14:48.304 --> 14:49.430
Off!

14:49.514 --> 14:51.357
You don't want them.
They're all slimy.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.442
Come on.

14:53.851 --> 14:56.104
- Die! Die!
- No way, it's ceasefire.

14:56.187 --> 14:58.189
Terrorist forces don't
respect the ceasefire.

14:58.481 --> 15:00.154
- You're dead.
- You don't want fish.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.156
- It's disgusting.
- Wait for me.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.155
Not there! Come on!

15:17.333 --> 15:19.461
For fuck's sake,
do you understand

15:19.544 --> 15:21.467
the implication here?

15:21.546 --> 15:24.675
Have you got any idea
what you're imposing?

15:30.680 --> 15:33.479
You are going to completely
lose any credibility.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.068
No.

15:39.397 --> 15:43.322
The whole point is
to focus on the ceasefire.

15:43.860 --> 15:45.533
What's the point in going
over it all again

15:45.611 --> 15:46.863
when I'm getting on a plane
at 10:00 in the morning?

15:46.946 --> 15:49.574
We can talk about this
in-person before the briefing.

15:50.199 --> 15:51.542
I'm not being emotional.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.585
The reason my email
mentioned my kids

15:53.661 --> 15:55.629
is 'cause we both know
what might be about to happen

15:55.705 --> 15:57.548
and I've got to get on a plane
and leave them here,

15:57.623 --> 16:00.172
so don't expect me to be fucking
calm about it, all right?

16:03.963 --> 16:05.431
- Edmond?
- No.

16:05.506 --> 16:06.928
It's Daisy.

16:07.133 --> 16:09.227
Elizabeth.

16:09.385 --> 16:12.059
Oh, Pascale, Pascale,
I'll call you back.

16:14.849 --> 16:16.101
Come in.

16:19.020 --> 16:21.398
Hey.

16:21.564 --> 16:23.783
Look at you.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.411
I'm sorry I've been
so bloody useless.

16:32.742 --> 16:35.837
It's this peace process.
It's a complete nightmare.

16:37.288 --> 16:39.916
Hello? Ah, Anya.
I have spoken to Pascale,

16:39.999 --> 16:41.046
and I'll call you back
in five minutes.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.251
All right? All right.

16:44.295 --> 16:46.297
Sorry about that.

16:48.132 --> 16:49.429
Sit.

16:54.305 --> 16:56.103
Yes.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.650
Always prepare for the worst.

16:57.725 --> 17:00.319
It's the best way
to ensure it never happens.

17:03.397 --> 17:05.023
Is everything okay?

17:08.109 --> 17:10.659
Everything's gonna be fine.

17:12.781 --> 17:14.910
So...

17:15.326 --> 17:16.873
how are you settling in?

17:18.204 --> 17:20.423
Yeah, it's... it's fine.

17:20.830 --> 17:22.377
I hope my children
are looking after you.

17:26.337 --> 17:28.385
Let them wait.

17:32.635 --> 17:34.387
Ah, now I've got you here,
I just wanted to ask...

17:34.470 --> 17:38.020
I've got to fly to Geneva in
the morning for a couple of days

17:38.266 --> 17:40.940
and I can't decide whether
or not to tell your father.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.149
What do you think?

17:43.312 --> 17:45.189
I don't want him
to worry unnecessarily.

17:45.273 --> 17:47.071
Don't bother.

17:47.191 --> 17:49.819
If my dad cared about me,
I wouldn't be here, so...

17:50.611 --> 17:52.238
don't worry about it.

17:55.283 --> 17:57.536
- What?
- Sorry. It's just...

17:59.328 --> 18:01.547
Just the way you said that just

18:01.706 --> 18:03.754
really reminded me of Julia.

18:06.043 --> 18:07.841
Mmm.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.094
It's funny.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.726
She used to love it here.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.347
It was her favorite place.

18:18.514 --> 18:20.482
My mom came here?

18:21.642 --> 18:22.985
Of course.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.155
Didn't your father
tell you that?

18:27.273 --> 18:28.399
No.

18:29.692 --> 18:31.069
No.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.579
Well, actually,
the room you're staying in,

18:33.654 --> 18:35.247
that's where she used to sleep.

18:47.168 --> 18:48.920
I've got to take this.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.880
Sorry.

18:51.005 --> 18:53.178
Yeah. Oh hi, Sam.
No no no, it's fine. It's fine.

18:53.257 --> 18:54.930
I'm sitting in front of it.

18:55.092 --> 18:57.766
If you tell me your thoughts,

18:58.220 --> 19:00.814
I will give you
a rough estimate. Yeah.

19:01.098 --> 19:03.271
Uh, Daisy? Daisy,
don't worry about anything.

19:03.351 --> 19:05.149
My friend Sally's gonna come up
and look after everything

19:05.269 --> 19:06.691
while I'm away, okay?

19:07.229 --> 19:09.072
All right. Good night!

19:09.565 --> 19:10.942
Yes.

19:45.893 --> 19:47.816
Come back quickly.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.616
Hey, um...
we're gonna go swimming

20:00.700 --> 20:02.828
before Sally gets here
and makes us eat vegetables.

20:03.411 --> 20:04.913
Do you wanna come?

20:05.162 --> 20:06.584
I don't swim.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.713
It's like a really special place.

20:09.792 --> 20:12.011
You'll love it.

20:12.086 --> 20:13.588
It's your last chance
to have some fun

20:13.671 --> 20:14.923
before the fascist regime.

20:16.382 --> 20:18.259
Uh-huh.

20:18.426 --> 20:20.474
Maybe next time.

20:22.596 --> 20:23.893
Okay.

20:29.186 --> 20:31.359
Stop stop.

20:31.439 --> 20:33.567
Stay away from distractions.
Take risks.

20:33.649 --> 20:35.447
Step out of your comfort zone.

20:35.526 --> 20:37.904
Physical shortcomings.
Find the goal of your life.

20:38.028 --> 20:40.998
Hey.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.589
Hey.

20:50.541 --> 20:52.919
What?
I can't change my mind?

20:53.085 --> 20:56.305
Oh no. Not her!

20:56.922 --> 20:59.050
N.B., just because
I'm attending

20:59.133 --> 21:01.306
doesn't mean I'm participating.

21:01.385 --> 21:03.183
There will be no swimming.

21:03.345 --> 21:04.767
Yeah, we'll see.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.437
- Hey, Jet, come on.
- Come on, Jet.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.063
- Jet!
- Come on, baby.

21:16.984 --> 21:18.782
Cool.

21:19.945 --> 21:21.197
Come on, let's go.

21:21.322 --> 21:22.619
Come on.

21:22.698 --> 21:24.371
- Come on.
- Jet!

21:29.747 --> 21:31.499
Can't catch me!

21:41.967 --> 21:43.560
Hello. Good dog.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.598
Come on, let's go. Hey.

21:48.516 --> 21:50.268
Don't go near them.
Come on, let's go.

21:51.519 --> 21:55.149
Are those cows or bulls?
Hey, guys?

21:55.231 --> 21:57.154
They're cows... cows!

21:57.483 --> 21:59.156
Cow-cheese cows!

22:01.403 --> 22:03.405
It's fine. You go on.

22:03.781 --> 22:05.954
- They won't hurt you.
- I know.

22:06.075 --> 22:07.998
I'm... I'm fine.
I'm just gonna go home.

22:08.118 --> 22:11.088
I didn't really wanna
go swimming anyway, so.

22:11.580 --> 22:12.706
Wait here.

22:42.111 --> 22:44.409
No way.
How'd you do that?

22:55.875 --> 22:58.003
- Oh ow! Ow shit!
- You okay?

22:58.210 --> 23:00.258
Aw, fucking dirty fence.

23:00.838 --> 23:02.431
- You're bleeding.
- It's cool.

23:02.506 --> 23:04.508
- It's not a big deal.
- Let me see.

23:04.675 --> 23:07.349
It's really fine.

23:21.025 --> 23:22.618
We'd better catch up.

23:33.495 --> 23:35.543
- Piper!
- Look, I did it!

23:35.623 --> 23:38.092
Look at this! Come on!

23:38.167 --> 23:40.386
Oh, it's cold!
It's cold! It's cold!

23:42.546 --> 23:45.220
Whoo!
Jet, oh, come here.

23:47.092 --> 23:49.094
- Joe, come on in.
- Come on, Jet.

23:49.303 --> 23:51.977
- Catch! Catch, Jet!
- It's freezing.

23:52.056 --> 23:53.979
Seriously, man,
it's not that cold.

23:54.683 --> 23:57.436
Hey! Oh, careful!

23:57.978 --> 24:00.072
Do you have any idea
what kind of bacteria

24:00.147 --> 24:01.148
lives in river water?

24:01.231 --> 24:02.983
Not this water.
Come on, Daisy.

24:03.067 --> 24:04.819
No one ever comes here
and doesn't go swimming.

24:05.069 --> 24:07.367
Yeah well, there's a first time
for everything.

24:10.324 --> 24:11.951
Whoa, saved your life.

24:15.746 --> 24:18.374
- Daisy, come and look at this.
- What?

24:18.624 --> 24:20.626
Just come and you'll see.

24:21.502 --> 24:24.096
Quick.
You're gonna miss it.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.018
Look, can you see it
right there?

24:30.094 --> 24:31.687
- No.
- Look. Just right there.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.977
Look. Right here.

24:34.098 --> 24:36.476
- Right there. Look.
- All these rules...

24:37.142 --> 24:38.894
you think you've got
to obey them.

24:39.186 --> 24:40.438
What are you talking about?

24:40.562 --> 24:42.064
All that noise inside your head.

24:42.189 --> 24:43.862
Dumb baby.

24:43.941 --> 24:46.069
Stop it.
It's in your head.

25:00.791 --> 25:02.543
You fuck!

25:08.799 --> 25:10.392
He loves me.

25:10.551 --> 25:12.428
He loves me not.

25:12.678 --> 25:14.351
He loves me.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.231
He loves me not.

25:23.647 --> 25:25.820
This is how you make
the best marshmallows.

25:26.025 --> 25:27.652
Place it in quite a small place

25:27.901 --> 25:29.244
and make sure
it's quite a hot place.

25:29.361 --> 25:30.738
Don't put it in for too long.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.623
Try some of this.

25:32.740 --> 25:34.492
- Mmm, do I have to?
- Yes.

25:34.575 --> 25:35.997
It's really good.

25:43.834 --> 25:46.383
Mmm.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.388
These are actually pretty good.

25:59.808 --> 26:01.435
What's up with them?

26:01.643 --> 26:03.395
It's probably Sally just
getting into the house.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.906
- They can hear for miles.
- Sally's our au pair.

26:05.981 --> 26:07.983
She's got
double-jointed thumbs.

26:44.812 --> 26:47.156
What's happening?

26:52.319 --> 26:54.162
I'd better get home.

26:56.698 --> 26:58.871
It's snowing.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.339
Get the stuff.
We're going.

27:10.087 --> 27:11.885
Piper, come on.
We're going now.

27:13.799 --> 27:15.267
Sally!

27:15.801 --> 27:17.519
Sally!

27:21.098 --> 27:22.771
Sally?

27:22.975 --> 27:24.852
Sally!

27:28.772 --> 27:30.820
I wanna see what the TV says.

27:31.400 --> 27:32.492
Piper.

27:32.609 --> 27:34.452
- What's going on?
- Sally's not here.

27:34.778 --> 27:37.247
And I tried phoning mom,
but the phone's not working.

27:37.406 --> 27:39.625
Hey, guys, quickly,
come and see this.

27:43.537 --> 27:45.631
that up to
15 different groups

27:45.706 --> 27:47.333
have claimed responsibility
for this attack.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.548
And to repeat,
we appear to be talking

27:50.669 --> 27:54.048
about a nuclear device
which has killed tens,

27:54.214 --> 27:56.387
if not hundreds of thousands
of people

27:56.550 --> 27:58.473
in and around the capital.

27:58.552 --> 28:00.520
And we're beginning
to hear of fallout

28:00.596 --> 28:03.349
as far afield as Bristol...

28:08.520 --> 28:10.648
Why did the TV go off?

28:12.149 --> 28:14.368
Where's mom?
We've got to go and get mom.

28:14.484 --> 28:15.986
Piper, shut up!
Stop being a baby!

28:16.153 --> 28:18.326
Hey, it's scary.
Leave her alone.

28:18.989 --> 28:20.616
Power cut. The whole house.

28:20.908 --> 28:22.501
Isaac, get the torch.

28:25.204 --> 28:28.003
Eddie, what's a nuclear?

28:28.498 --> 28:31.172
It's just something
they say on the TV.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.136
Shush now. Come here.

28:34.546 --> 28:36.548
Radio might tell us more, eh?

28:37.591 --> 28:39.343
How far away is London?

28:39.801 --> 28:40.768
Far.

28:40.969 --> 28:42.471
We heard the sound.
We heard it happen.

28:42.888 --> 28:44.231
Boom!

28:44.598 --> 28:46.692
- Isaac.
- You fucking asshole!

28:53.023 --> 28:54.616
It's not a game.

28:58.862 --> 29:00.489
powerful today
would wreak havoc

29:00.572 --> 29:02.745
on our communication systems,
potentially resulting

29:02.824 --> 29:04.292
in the blackouts
that last for months.

29:04.368 --> 29:05.790
It should be taken
once a day with water.

29:07.204 --> 29:08.831
Stop slouching, itching.

29:08.914 --> 29:11.542
God, I hate... 88 lbs.
What is your problem?

29:11.625 --> 29:13.673
Hurry the fuck up.
You're disgusting.

29:13.752 --> 29:14.719
Disgusting!
Did you know that?

29:14.795 --> 29:16.092
I'm a fucking curse.

29:30.227 --> 29:32.480
I keep thinking about mom.

29:33.939 --> 29:35.486
Mom's in Switzerland.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.401
Nothing ever happens
in Switzerland.

29:37.859 --> 29:39.406
I want to talk to her.

29:39.486 --> 29:40.988
You can't, remember?

29:41.071 --> 29:42.448
The phone's not working.

29:46.034 --> 29:48.287
I bet mom's already
on her way home.

29:48.370 --> 29:49.542
She's not gonna
stick around in Geneva

29:49.621 --> 29:51.623
once she knows what's
happened here, is she?

29:52.165 --> 29:53.041
No way.

29:53.125 --> 29:54.968
She'll probably be
on the next flight home.

29:55.085 --> 29:57.258
Mom's an expert.
She'll know what to do.

29:57.629 --> 29:59.051
We've just gotta wait.

30:07.139 --> 30:09.016
...recorded announcement.

30:09.266 --> 30:11.860
The government has declared
a state of emergency.

30:12.561 --> 30:14.108
Do not panic.

30:14.730 --> 30:16.152
Following the detonation
of a device

30:16.231 --> 30:20.327
at 1600 hours today,
civil law has been suspended.

30:21.236 --> 30:23.330
Any civilians caught
defying martial law

30:23.488 --> 30:25.707
will be subject
to court-martial.

30:25.782 --> 30:27.159
Stay in your homes

30:27.242 --> 30:28.915
and await further information.

30:28.994 --> 30:29.870
Hey, come here.

30:29.953 --> 30:32.797
This is a special
recorded announcement.

30:33.707 --> 30:35.801
Shh shh shh shh.

30:36.877 --> 30:38.345
All right?

30:38.670 --> 30:40.047
Mom's fine.

31:36.561 --> 31:38.279
Daisy.

31:38.480 --> 31:39.982
Daisy.

31:41.691 --> 31:42.943
Shh.

31:43.485 --> 31:45.487
I want to show you something.

31:45.987 --> 31:47.830
They said stay home.

31:47.948 --> 31:49.245
The woods are home.

31:49.324 --> 31:50.701
What if there's like
radioactivity

31:50.784 --> 31:52.252
in the air
or fallout or something?

31:53.286 --> 31:54.503
Eddie.

31:55.122 --> 31:56.465
Eddie.

32:09.302 --> 32:11.145
Oh my God.

32:11.763 --> 32:13.515
She had a broken wing.

32:13.682 --> 32:15.559
It needed a chance to heal.

32:15.976 --> 32:17.649
Is it okay?

32:22.190 --> 32:23.316
She's ready.

33:02.772 --> 33:04.024
Whoa!

33:14.576 --> 33:16.249
She's beautiful.

33:23.877 --> 33:25.754
I'm so sorry.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.552
It's all my fault.

33:30.425 --> 33:31.893
What is?

33:33.595 --> 33:35.188
Daisy?

33:36.723 --> 33:38.725
I'm a fucking curse.

33:43.688 --> 33:45.156
What are you talking about?

33:45.315 --> 33:47.363
Everywhere I go...

33:48.276 --> 33:50.324
bad shit happens.

33:50.904 --> 33:52.952
I'm glad you came.

33:56.159 --> 33:58.161
It's better with you here.

34:06.920 --> 34:10.174
New Zealand's in, like,
the middle of nowhere.

34:10.257 --> 34:12.259
It must be, like,
so cool to live there.

34:12.801 --> 34:16.304
Like there'd be, like,
no one around.

34:23.937 --> 34:26.031
Look, Geneva's not
that far away.

34:26.523 --> 34:28.275
Mom could probably drive home.

34:36.157 --> 34:38.751
- You're bluffing.
- No, I'm not.

34:39.159 --> 34:41.504
- You're cheating.
- What?

34:43.081 --> 34:45.630
Looking into
my mind like that.

35:04.144 --> 35:05.396
- You okay?
- Yeah.

35:05.478 --> 35:06.900
I'm just gonna get some air.

36:03.703 --> 36:05.705
No.

36:05.914 --> 36:08.212
- We... we can't. We're...
- Daisy.

36:14.089 --> 36:15.466
No, we shouldn't.

36:15.882 --> 36:17.304
We can't.

36:19.636 --> 36:21.309
More rules?

36:44.452 --> 36:46.045
Stay here.

36:49.999 --> 36:52.127
- Can I help you?
- Uh, yeah,

36:52.293 --> 36:54.842
I hope so.
I'm looking for...

36:55.171 --> 36:57.765
Is there a Miss Elizabeth
Ryback here?

37:02.595 --> 37:04.814
I'm sorry.
This is confidential.

37:05.140 --> 37:06.562
They're my cousins.

37:06.641 --> 37:08.643
Just the same,
if you don't mind.

37:10.729 --> 37:12.197
Okay.

37:20.405 --> 37:22.624
I'm from the American consulate

37:22.907 --> 37:25.501
in Edinburgh.

37:25.702 --> 37:29.707
You are Miss Elizabeth Ryback,

37:29.831 --> 37:32.755
the daughter of Julia Ryback,
deceased,

37:32.834 --> 37:35.212
and David Ryback
of New York City.

37:39.174 --> 37:40.676
Shh!

37:55.440 --> 37:56.817
What about my cousins?

37:59.652 --> 38:01.746
If they're not U.S. Citizens,
I can't help you.

38:15.877 --> 38:18.300
Hey.
Thanks for all your help.

38:20.215 --> 38:21.933
Can you tell us
what's going on?

38:22.425 --> 38:23.677
Out there?

38:24.052 --> 38:25.929
Try not to worry, okay?

38:26.179 --> 38:28.273
They're gonna start
an evacuation of this area

38:28.348 --> 38:29.770
in the next couple of days.

38:29.849 --> 38:31.817
I'm sure they're gonna
take you to a more

38:31.976 --> 38:34.024
secure environment, so...

38:34.145 --> 38:36.364
just sit tight.

38:38.024 --> 38:39.241
Stay inside.

39:16.938 --> 39:18.656
He gave me a ticket home.

39:19.107 --> 39:20.108
They're going to pick me up

39:20.191 --> 39:21.943
from the village
in the morning.

39:25.697 --> 39:26.698
I know.

39:28.616 --> 39:30.539
Of course you do.

39:31.953 --> 39:33.455
I'm glad.

39:33.872 --> 39:35.419
I want you to be safe.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.627
Eddie.

39:38.710 --> 39:40.007
Don't worry about us.

39:40.670 --> 39:41.887
We'll be fine.

39:42.881 --> 39:44.849
There's a barn
on the other side of the woods.

39:45.216 --> 39:46.684
We'll move up there.

39:47.135 --> 39:48.933
I don't care about
some stupid evacuation.

39:49.846 --> 39:51.473
This is our home.

39:51.556 --> 39:52.978
We're not leaving.

39:59.814 --> 40:00.986
Charge!

40:04.569 --> 40:06.287
Come on, let's go! Go go go!

40:06.404 --> 40:07.906
We're taking them on the inside!

40:07.989 --> 40:10.287
Ugh, get off.

40:12.911 --> 40:14.709
It's a ray gun!

40:14.787 --> 40:16.380
Come on, come on.

40:21.586 --> 40:23.213
Hey, Pipes.

40:24.923 --> 40:26.891
Ooh, sorry.

40:27.008 --> 40:28.134
Ready?

40:28.551 --> 40:30.645
You got it?

40:30.720 --> 40:32.518
Remember, you're sleeping
up here with me tonight.

40:32.764 --> 40:33.890
- Okay.
- Daisy,

40:33.973 --> 40:35.475
you've got to sleep there

40:35.558 --> 40:38.357
since you're only staying here
for one night.

40:38.686 --> 40:40.734
So you've got to have
the worst bed.

40:47.278 --> 40:50.031
Come on, Jet!
Come on!

41:00.041 --> 41:01.884
Quick!

41:02.251 --> 41:04.800
Joe, chuck it over here!

41:09.384 --> 41:10.977
That's a good boy.

43:24.268 --> 43:25.690
What are you doing?

43:29.607 --> 43:31.405
I'm so scared.

43:32.193 --> 43:33.615
And I wanna know

43:33.694 --> 43:35.412
what it's like to be 17.

43:35.655 --> 43:37.328
Or 25, you know?

43:37.406 --> 43:38.828
Daisy.

43:39.659 --> 43:42.162
But what if we can
get through this...

43:42.829 --> 43:44.831
and there's life
on the other side?

43:47.041 --> 43:48.884
If there is,

43:49.210 --> 43:52.214
I wanna be here with you.

43:54.632 --> 43:56.430
This is how I wanna live.

43:57.426 --> 43:59.303
And if all this isn't here

43:59.428 --> 44:01.305
and you don't survive,

44:01.973 --> 44:03.691
then I don't wanna live at all.

44:04.225 --> 44:05.977
No!

44:30.293 --> 44:31.510
Come on! I'm gonna win!

46:11.936 --> 46:13.233

- Can't.

46:15.022 --> 46:16.239
Well, don't tell
anyone we're here.

46:16.315 --> 46:17.362
Keep it there,
keep it there.

No, leave it, leave it!

46:21.654 --> 46:23.873

46:33.624 --> 46:34.876
Come on, gin, come on.

46:35.042 --> 46:36.919
- See ya! Bye!
- Goodbye, Joe!

46:37.962 --> 46:40.056
- Bye, Joe!
- Bye!

47:07.533 --> 47:08.910
- What?
- Don't move! Fire!

47:08.993 --> 47:10.165
- Get down!
- The windows!

47:10.244 --> 47:11.245
Dase, get down.

47:13.831 --> 47:16.300
- Isaac, Piper!
- Eddie!

47:16.375 --> 47:18.252
- I don't want to die!
- Come here.

47:18.336 --> 47:19.804
- Come here, it's all right.
- What's going on?

47:19.879 --> 47:21.802
- Clear!
- Stay down, stay down!

47:21.881 --> 47:23.929
Keep your head down!
Isaac!

47:24.050 --> 47:25.848
Fire!

47:26.010 --> 47:28.229
Move move move!

47:28.304 --> 47:30.807
- Right, go!
- Position ready!

47:30.890 --> 47:33.518
Don't shoot!

47:33.642 --> 47:35.690
- In the building!
- Don't shoot!

47:35.811 --> 47:37.108
Don't shoot, please!
Don't shoot us!

47:37.188 --> 47:38.690
- Eddie, Eddie!
- Please please.

47:38.773 --> 47:40.195
Get down!
Let me see your hands!

47:40.274 --> 47:41.571
Down down down!

47:44.236 --> 47:46.034
Move out!

47:46.155 --> 47:48.499
- Get down on the floor now!
- Put your head down!

47:48.616 --> 47:51.540
Moving out!

47:51.619 --> 47:53.838
This whole area's
crawling with enemy units.

47:53.913 --> 47:55.586
Okay, we need to get you
out of here fast.

47:55.664 --> 47:57.507
Girls, follow me.
Boys, how old are you?

47:57.583 --> 47:59.051
I'm 16. I'm old enough
to look after all of us.

47:59.126 --> 48:00.298
- How old are you?
- 14.

48:00.419 --> 48:02.342
We don't need help.

48:02.463 --> 48:03.885
I want the girls in residential.

48:04.006 --> 48:05.758
Boys, these two, Gatesfield.

48:06.175 --> 48:07.301
Stay where you are.

48:07.385 --> 48:09.308
Girls, what did I say?
Get in the van.

48:09.470 --> 48:10.392
Boys, you wait there

48:10.471 --> 48:11.848
and someone'll come down
and advise you.

48:12.014 --> 48:13.391
What's Gatesfield?

48:14.100 --> 48:16.068
Look, this is not a discussion.

48:16.143 --> 48:18.111
- This is an order.
- I'm a U.S. citizen.

48:18.187 --> 48:19.734
We're not going anywhere,
and I wanna speak

48:19.814 --> 48:22.112
to the American embassy
right now!

48:22.316 --> 48:24.364
- Reynolds! Atherty!
- Sarge?

48:24.443 --> 48:26.366
Get them in the van.

48:26.654 --> 48:29.032
Wherever they take you,
find a way to get back here.

48:29.198 --> 48:30.791
Promise me.

48:30.866 --> 48:32.539
Son, out of the way.

48:32.701 --> 48:34.328
- Girls, in the van.
- You can't split us up.

48:34.495 --> 48:36.748
- Eddie... Eddie, don't.
- Move out of the way.

48:36.831 --> 48:39.425
- Stay away from us.
- I'm not gonna tell you again.

48:41.627 --> 48:43.174
- Girls, you're coming with me.
- No!

48:43.587 --> 48:44.759
- Get off me!
- Calm down.

48:45.005 --> 48:46.507
- Just keep still.
- Get off!

48:46.674 --> 48:47.891
Calm down.

48:48.008 --> 48:49.601
- Eddie! Eddie!
- Come on, miss.

48:50.469 --> 48:51.766
- Eddie!
- Daisy! Let her go!

48:51.846 --> 48:53.598
- Restrain her. Get her in.
- Get off of me!

48:53.764 --> 48:55.687
- No!
- Get off!

48:56.016 --> 48:57.188
- Piper!
- Eddie, stop it!

48:57.351 --> 48:59.570
- Eddie!
- You need to fucking calm down!

48:59.812 --> 49:02.031
Remember what I said, Daisy!

49:02.106 --> 49:03.983
- Get off her!
- Just sit down.

49:06.986 --> 49:09.159
Just sit down, sit down.
Calm down.

49:10.614 --> 49:11.957
I won't tell you again.
Sit down.

49:12.366 --> 49:13.743
Daisy!

49:15.035 --> 49:16.378
Remember what I said!

50:41.622 --> 50:42.669
Move it!

51:12.278 --> 51:14.155
You two, out.

51:27.459 --> 51:28.756
Come in.

51:38.971 --> 51:41.724
I'm Mrs. McEvoy,
and this is my home.

51:41.849 --> 51:44.978
So please, make sure
you treat it with respect.

51:45.060 --> 51:47.108
There we are.

51:48.314 --> 51:49.566
This way, please.

52:03.454 --> 52:06.458
Toilet's through there.

52:06.874 --> 52:08.672
Bucket's by the toilet.

52:08.917 --> 52:11.045
Water tablets are
on ration since yesterday,

52:11.128 --> 52:13.472
so you'll have to wait
till Friday to have a wash.

52:14.506 --> 52:16.053
Here we are.

52:17.384 --> 52:19.807
Only one rule in here.

52:20.387 --> 52:23.015
Don't touch any
of Nick's stuff, okay?

52:23.265 --> 52:24.938
He will come home.

52:26.518 --> 52:28.816
- So.
- Water tablets?

52:29.480 --> 52:31.232
My dear child,
where have you been?

52:31.315 --> 52:33.317
The terrorists contaminated
the water supply.

52:33.400 --> 52:35.448
We have to clean it
before we go near it.

52:35.569 --> 52:38.664
We've been drinking water
at home, and swimming.

52:39.365 --> 52:41.538
Well, you should
consider yourself lucky.

52:41.700 --> 52:44.624
I'll give you a call
when supper's ready.

52:44.745 --> 52:46.588
The major will be home soon.

53:02.388 --> 53:04.482
How... how...

53:04.556 --> 53:06.308
- Mommy.
- What?

53:06.725 --> 53:08.147
How-.

53:08.268 --> 53:10.646
How will mommy find us?

53:11.063 --> 53:12.861
Hey.

53:12.981 --> 53:15.279
Come on, don't worry
about that now.

53:17.653 --> 53:19.326
I want my mommy.

53:21.407 --> 53:23.080
I know.

53:28.163 --> 53:30.086
Don't cry.

53:31.375 --> 53:33.469
I'm here and...

53:33.544 --> 53:35.763
and your mom's okay.

53:36.672 --> 53:38.174
She's just been held up.

53:43.554 --> 53:45.056
Come here.

53:51.145 --> 53:53.193
We're going to get home, okay?

53:55.274 --> 53:56.867
I promise.

53:57.568 --> 53:59.161
But we need to be strong.

54:04.825 --> 54:07.419
How was the farm today, dear?

54:08.287 --> 54:11.791
People seem to be
getting the hang of it.

54:11.999 --> 54:15.344
It's hard work,
but someone's got to do it.

54:15.544 --> 54:18.468
People do what they have to
when times are tough.

54:19.131 --> 54:21.554
Don't we, girls? Eh?

54:21.633 --> 54:22.805
...terrorist units control

54:22.885 --> 54:25.638
some portions of the country.
Remain calm.

54:25.763 --> 54:28.937
Do not leave your homes
unless absolutely necessary.

54:29.349 --> 54:31.272
DO not leave secure zones.

54:31.518 --> 54:34.237
This is the wartime
radio service.

54:42.237 --> 54:43.363
And now here is the official

54:43.447 --> 54:45.449
6:00 news bulletin.

54:45.616 --> 54:47.869
Violent outbreaks have been
reported across the region,

54:47.951 --> 54:49.669
as guerrilla groups
battle for territory

54:49.745 --> 54:52.123
beyond the government-allocated
secure zones.

54:52.664 --> 54:53.756
Civilians are reminded

54:53.832 --> 54:55.505
that traveling outside
the secure zones

54:55.584 --> 54:57.382
is currently
restricted until further...

55:00.506 --> 55:02.383
Is that two or three of them?

55:04.927 --> 55:07.271
We've got another group
to pick up.

55:07.429 --> 55:08.681
Mind your step.

55:10.933 --> 55:12.526
Mind your head.

55:18.774 --> 55:20.742
I can't even
feel my fingers.

57:22.564 --> 57:24.282
She used to love it here.

57:24.775 --> 57:26.618
I'm home.

57:37.204 --> 57:39.832
Wait for me.

57:42.292 --> 57:43.669
I've got everything together.

57:43.752 --> 57:45.127
We're ready to go.

57:45.128 --> 57:47.677
And guess what?
I had a dream about Eddie.

57:48.006 --> 57:49.929
- Eddie?
- And he's home already.

57:51.551 --> 57:53.144
I can feel it.

57:54.096 --> 57:56.394
All right? Mind how you go.

57:57.891 --> 57:59.518
Do you need a hand?

58:00.352 --> 58:01.945
Attention all workers.

58:02.229 --> 58:04.527
If at any time you would
like to clean your hands,

58:04.815 --> 58:06.613
please make your way
to Water Zone D.

58:07.234 --> 58:09.111
For your own safety,
you are reminded

58:09.194 --> 58:11.492
to follow hygiene procedure
at all times.

58:14.992 --> 58:16.539
Joe?

58:16.910 --> 58:19.584
Oh, Joe.
What are you doing here?

58:19.746 --> 58:21.748
Working.

58:21.915 --> 58:23.713
- Are you okay?
- Remember,

58:23.792 --> 58:24.759
if you don't know the source...

58:24.835 --> 58:26.257
What happened to your face?

58:26.878 --> 58:28.004
Nothing.

58:28.130 --> 58:30.349
Just a fight with some boys.

58:30.590 --> 58:32.183
They took my dad away.

58:32.759 --> 58:35.683
I'm staying in this weird house
with other kids.

58:36.013 --> 58:38.357
Have you seen Eddie or Isaac?

58:39.016 --> 58:40.939
No.

58:41.018 --> 58:43.362
Be vigilant.

58:43.437 --> 58:44.734
They... they said Gin...

58:44.813 --> 58:46.736
Be suspicious.
Be responsible.

58:48.900 --> 58:50.197
- Hey.
- What happened to Gin?

58:50.277 --> 58:51.745
Come on, everyone!
Trucks are here!

58:51.820 --> 58:53.322
- Load up now! Come on!
- Come on.

58:53.405 --> 58:54.452
Come on, girls, that's it.

58:54.531 --> 58:56.033
Attention all workers.

58:56.158 --> 58:58.160
Attention. Be alert.

58:58.285 --> 59:00.629
Come on, you two.
Go on, son.

59:00.704 --> 59:01.705
You go with them today.

59:02.622 --> 59:04.249
- Good man.
- Do not leave the secure area.

59:04.250 --> 59:06.047
Last to go.

59:18.263 --> 59:19.981
Joe, we're escaping, Joe.

59:20.348 --> 59:21.770
Going home.

59:21.975 --> 59:23.693
I've got everything ready.

59:24.686 --> 59:26.404
Will you come with us?

59:26.646 --> 59:28.148
There's no point.

59:29.274 --> 59:30.571
It's all gone.

59:32.027 --> 59:33.700
Everyone's dead.

59:45.123 --> 59:47.751
- Want some?
- Put that away!

59:47.959 --> 59:49.085
Checkpoint.

01:00:05.519 --> 01:00:07.442
- Why have we stopped?
- I don't know.

01:00:07.687 --> 01:00:08.734
Can you see
what's going on?

01:00:10.065 --> 01:00:11.783
Is that a fire?

01:00:16.196 --> 01:00:17.322
Get down, everybody!

01:00:17.405 --> 01:00:18.782
Get down! Stay down!

01:00:19.574 --> 01:00:21.042
They've taken
the checkpoint!

01:00:28.834 --> 01:00:31.303
Hang on, hang on!

01:00:31.753 --> 01:00:34.472
Come on!
Shit, we're stuck!

01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:35.636
- We're stuck!
- Stay down, everyone.

01:00:35.757 --> 01:00:37.976
Joe!

01:00:38.218 --> 01:00:40.437
- Get down!
- Fucking cocks!

01:00:40.595 --> 01:00:42.973
- Did you hear that?
- Joe, get down!

01:00:43.056 --> 01:00:44.433
- Joe, get down!
- Down!

01:00:44.516 --> 01:00:46.189
- You killed my dog!
- Joe, please.

01:00:46.434 --> 01:00:48.357
- Get down!
- We're gonna blow your brains...

01:00:48.436 --> 01:00:49.528
Joe!

01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:58.447
Quick! Oh my God!

01:00:58.530 --> 01:00:59.531
Rock!

01:01:04.369 --> 01:01:06.542
- Please.
- Killed my dog.

01:01:11.459 --> 01:01:13.427
Look!

01:01:14.629 --> 01:01:16.006
They're coming!

01:01:20.135 --> 01:01:21.478
Quick!

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:25.057
Hey!

01:01:25.182 --> 01:01:26.274
Try it now!

01:01:27.309 --> 01:01:29.687
- Floor it!
- Come on!

01:01:53.001 --> 01:01:54.674
They've taken the checkpoint.

01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:57.214
We had to go all the way round
to the other side.

01:01:57.297 --> 01:01:58.469
We need to leave here now.

01:01:58.548 --> 01:01:59.845
We have to wait for Nick!

01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:14.606
She told us not
to touch his stuff.

01:02:14.689 --> 01:02:16.737
Her stupid son's gone to war,

01:02:16.816 --> 01:02:18.989
and he's not coming back.

01:02:19.277 --> 01:02:21.154
We have to go now.

01:02:21.279 --> 01:02:22.531
It's dangerous here.

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:32.336
Look at me.

01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:33.925
Look at me.

01:02:34.042 --> 01:02:36.090
We're gonna get
through this, okay?

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:38.759
You just gotta take
that bad thing,

01:02:38.838 --> 01:02:40.681
you take it,
you put it in a box,

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:41.758
you close the lid,

01:02:41.841 --> 01:02:44.344
you look up and you focus
on your goal, okay?

01:02:44.678 --> 01:02:46.146
Because that's what
you have to do now.

01:02:46.221 --> 01:02:48.644
You have to look up
and focus on your goal!

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:09.578
Put your stuff on.
Quick.

01:03:14.833 --> 01:03:16.460
Don't be stupid, woman.

01:03:16.543 --> 01:03:18.261
- It's not safe here.
- I will stay here

01:03:18.336 --> 01:03:20.634
till my son comes back.
I'm going nowhere!

01:03:20.714 --> 01:03:22.091
They're gonna
be here any minute.

01:03:22.173 --> 01:03:24.551
You can't make me.
I am waiting here for my Nick.

01:03:44.404 --> 01:03:46.281
Eddie?

01:03:46.406 --> 01:03:48.579
Eddie, Eddie! Are you here?

01:03:50.744 --> 01:03:52.667
Eddie, come back!

01:03:52.746 --> 01:03:54.623
Eddie, are you here?

01:03:54.706 --> 01:03:56.049
Eddie! Eddie!

01:04:05.175 --> 01:04:08.349
My feet hurt, Daisy.
Can we stop for a bit?

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:10.104
No.

01:04:10.388 --> 01:04:13.232
- Please!
- Not now.

01:04:13.475 --> 01:04:15.398
We've got six or seven clays'
walk ahead of us.

01:04:15.477 --> 01:04:17.354
We need to be disciplined.

01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:19.606
Come on.
The boys are waiting.

01:04:25.904 --> 01:04:28.999
Water tablets. Shit!

01:04:31.117 --> 01:04:32.369
Stop drinking.

01:04:32.452 --> 01:04:34.921
I forgot the fucking
water tablets!

01:04:35.622 --> 01:04:37.590
We need to save that.

01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:40.802
I knew I'd fuck it up.

01:04:42.337 --> 01:04:44.260
God damn it, Daisy.
What's the matter with you?

01:04:49.636 --> 01:04:51.513
Come on, Piper.
We need to get out of the open.

01:06:09.382 --> 01:06:13.307
Do you think
Eddie and Isaac are okay?

01:06:16.097 --> 01:06:18.191
Yeah, of course they are.

01:06:28.693 --> 01:06:30.161
Chocolates!

01:06:32.113 --> 01:06:33.456
Piper, come on!

01:06:38.286 --> 01:06:39.754
Piper!

01:06:57.764 --> 01:06:59.232
Finish it.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:06.823
We need to keep moving.

01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:08.988
- Are you okay?
- I said keep moving.

01:07:34.968 --> 01:07:36.595
Daisy?

01:07:36.928 --> 01:07:38.521
Eddie?

01:07:47.272 --> 01:07:49.570
Help.

01:07:50.108 --> 01:07:51.485
Help me!

01:08:22.307 --> 01:08:24.526
No, stop it!

01:08:27.604 --> 01:08:29.857
You like that, do you, huh?
You like it?

01:08:29.981 --> 01:08:32.325
Come here, you dirty little slut.

01:08:32.442 --> 01:08:34.991
Get off... get off me!

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:38.913
No no!

01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:40.867
- Come on, give us a kiss.
-  Get off!

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:42.917
Get off me!

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:45.712
No!

01:08:57.383 --> 01:08:58.635
Get down there.

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:25.836
Help me,

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:51.145
Get off. Get off!

01:09:51.395 --> 01:09:52.648
Get off!

01:09:59.612 --> 01:10:01.990
Get up. Quick, get up.

01:10:02.407 --> 01:10:04.125
We need to move now.

01:10:06.494 --> 01:10:09.122
- What's going on?
- Shh.

01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:31.019
Daisy.

01:10:31.144 --> 01:10:33.772
I'm tired.

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:36.074
My feet hurt.

01:10:37.108 --> 01:10:39.406
I need water!

01:10:39.986 --> 01:10:42.159
We've been walking for hours.

01:10:42.947 --> 01:10:44.199
I'm tired.

01:10:44.407 --> 01:10:46.409
- Daisy.
- Will you shut up?!

01:10:46.784 --> 01:10:51.460
I am so sick of your stupid,
whiny voice all the time.

01:10:51.789 --> 01:10:53.336
Do you want me to just
leave you here?

01:10:53.666 --> 01:10:55.213
Because that's what
I'm gonna do.

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:57.428
If you don't shut the fuck up,

01:10:57.503 --> 01:10:58.425
I am gonna run,

01:10:58.504 --> 01:11:00.131
and you're gonna be
left here on your own

01:11:00.214 --> 01:11:01.966
in the dark and you're
gonna die out here.

01:11:03.134 --> 01:11:06.058
Do you wanna see
your brothers again?

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:08.773
Well, come on.

01:11:33.206 --> 01:11:34.958
Piper.

01:11:35.041 --> 01:11:36.714
Piper!
What are you doing?

01:11:37.168 --> 01:11:38.385
It might be poison.

01:11:38.461 --> 01:11:40.805
- I forgot!
- Well, you can't forget, okay?

01:11:41.005 --> 01:11:43.224
If you don't know the source,
you can't trust the water.

01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:44.926
And you shouldn't have
eaten all that chocolate.

01:11:45.009 --> 01:11:46.477
That was stupid.

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:49.813
Mommy says I'm a monster
for chocolates.

01:11:50.598 --> 01:11:52.441
I just can't help myself.

01:11:55.603 --> 01:11:57.901
Maybe that's why she went away.

01:11:58.022 --> 01:11:59.399
What?

01:12:00.358 --> 01:12:01.905
'Cause I was greedy.

01:12:02.026 --> 01:12:03.869
What are you talking about?

01:12:04.028 --> 01:12:06.656
'Cause she didn't want
to be around me anymore!

01:12:14.247 --> 01:12:16.170
Hey.

01:12:17.083 --> 01:12:20.178
Sometimes people say things
they don't mean.

01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:22.338
Your mom loves you
more than anything.

01:12:23.756 --> 01:12:25.508
And she's so proud of you.

01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:28.094
- I know that for a fact.
- How?

01:12:30.471 --> 01:12:33.350
Well, I'm older than you and...

01:12:35.852 --> 01:12:37.820
it's just something I know.

01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:40.573
And listen, about last night,

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:45.536
I'm sorry I said that stuff.
I didn't mean it, okay?

01:12:48.155 --> 01:12:49.407
Come on.

01:13:25.568 --> 01:13:27.787
<i>♪ Not because they're dirty ♪</i>

01:13:27.904 --> 01:13:29.702
<i>♪ Not because they're clean ♪</i>

01:13:29.947 --> 01:13:33.497

a boy behind a magazine ♪</i>

01:13:33.618 --> 01:13:36.622

<i>♪ She can't do this. ♪</i>

01:13:46.339 --> 01:13:48.057
- Daisy?
- Hmm?

01:13:48.174 --> 01:13:50.222
What was your mommy like?

01:13:51.552 --> 01:13:53.646
I never really met her.

01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:55.102
How come?

01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:58.688
She died while I was being born.

01:14:03.314 --> 01:14:04.861
Do you miss her?

01:14:06.067 --> 01:14:07.569
Yeah,

01:14:07.777 --> 01:14:09.199
sometimes.

01:14:11.405 --> 01:14:13.874
If she'd never had me,
she'd probably still be alive.

01:14:18.371 --> 01:14:21.170
Hey, come on.
We've got walking to do.

01:14:24.251 --> 01:14:25.844
I hate walking.

01:14:28.965 --> 01:14:31.764
When I get home,
I'm never going to walk again.

01:14:47.358 --> 01:14:50.032
Look. Look!

01:14:51.153 --> 01:14:53.326
That's the boys' place.

01:14:53.531 --> 01:14:54.703
Gatesfield.

01:14:54.782 --> 01:14:56.455
That's where they've
taken Eddie and Isaac.

01:14:56.784 --> 01:14:59.253
I told you, they've gone home already.

01:14:59.453 --> 01:15:02.252
But you're not sure.

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:04.425
Just 'cause you had a dream,

01:15:04.542 --> 01:15:06.260
who says the dream's real?

01:15:13.509 --> 01:15:14.852
Okay,

01:15:14.927 --> 01:15:16.804
come on.

01:15:16.929 --> 01:15:18.476
Yes. Come on.

01:15:18.556 --> 01:15:20.775
As soon as I see
Eddie and Isaac,

01:15:20.891 --> 01:15:23.235
I'm gonna give them a big hug.
Ah.

01:15:35.781 --> 01:15:38.284
Where is everyone?

01:15:41.537 --> 01:15:43.380
What was that?

01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:53.632
Stay here, okay?

01:17:33.691 --> 01:17:35.534
Are you here?

01:17:38.028 --> 01:17:39.780
You'd better not be here.

01:19:15.626 --> 01:19:16.878
sympathy of others.

01:19:16.961 --> 01:19:18.884
Itching, rashes, water tablets.

01:19:19.004 --> 01:19:21.006
Certain degree of willpower
and self-discipline.

01:19:51.912 --> 01:19:54.415
- What was in there?
- Come on.

01:19:54.707 --> 01:19:56.709
We need to get away from here.

01:19:58.419 --> 01:20:00.046
Where are my brothers?

01:20:01.672 --> 01:20:03.015
I don't know.

01:20:06.427 --> 01:20:07.679
Come on.

01:21:00.064 --> 01:21:01.941
Eddie.

01:21:03.734 --> 01:21:05.236
Are you okay?

01:21:11.575 --> 01:21:15.671
Can you just give me a sign
or something?

01:21:20.501 --> 01:21:22.128
Eddie?

01:21:47.486 --> 01:21:48.829
Ahh.

01:21:53.826 --> 01:21:56.079
Don't worry.
It's not far now.

01:21:57.121 --> 01:21:58.714
We should be home tomorrow.

01:21:59.039 --> 01:22:00.632
Really?

01:22:06.547 --> 01:22:08.800
I've saved a piece of chocolate.
Do you want it now?

01:22:32.448 --> 01:22:33.574
Quick.

01:22:34.491 --> 01:22:36.459
Go! Quick.

01:22:47.921 --> 01:22:49.764
Come on, Piper! Come on!

01:22:52.509 --> 01:22:53.931
Come on.

01:22:54.011 --> 01:22:55.103
Quick.

01:23:00.142 --> 01:23:01.985
Come on!

01:23:06.899 --> 01:23:08.401
Come on.

01:23:09.568 --> 01:23:10.990
Hurry up.

01:23:14.239 --> 01:23:15.491
Come on.

01:23:18.869 --> 01:23:19.995
In here.

01:23:20.454 --> 01:23:21.421
Quick.

01:23:47.898 --> 01:23:49.525
Oh, you're a big rabbit,
aren't you?

01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:51.534
- Get off of me!
-  Hey.

01:23:51.610 --> 01:23:54.238
- No! Get off!
- I'm not going to hurt you.

01:23:54.947 --> 01:23:57.075
- Hey.
- Let her go!

01:23:57.574 --> 01:23:59.292
I said let her go now!

01:24:01.036 --> 01:24:02.583
What the fuck are you laughing at?

01:24:03.539 --> 01:24:05.166
Don't move any closer.

01:24:05.499 --> 01:24:07.797
We're only winding
you up, love, eh?

01:24:09.503 --> 01:24:10.925
Come on, little lady.

01:24:11.755 --> 01:24:13.132
It's just a bit of fun.

01:24:15.384 --> 01:24:16.977
Don't you dare!

01:24:20.597 --> 01:24:22.520
Take it easy now.
Take it easy. Take it easy.

01:24:22.766 --> 01:24:24.018
Calm down. Take it easy.

01:24:24.101 --> 01:24:25.444
You don't have to do any...

01:24:25.561 --> 01:24:26.653
Find a goal in life.

01:24:26.728 --> 01:24:28.150
They stay in. Stop.
What is your problem?

01:24:28.272 --> 01:24:30.400
What is your problem?

01:24:30.983 --> 01:24:33.031
Hurry the fuck up.
Stay away from distractions.

01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:35.784
Take risks. Step out of your...
She almost got...

01:24:38.031 --> 01:24:40.329
Accept life is unfair.
Focus on your goal.

01:24:40.576 --> 01:24:44.171
- Oh God!
- That's for touching my cousin

01:24:44.496 --> 01:24:47.295
with your dirty,
disgusting fingers!

01:25:17.571 --> 01:25:19.448
The map.

01:25:19.781 --> 01:25:20.828
Map.

01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:24.123
The compass.

01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:26.088
The map.

01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:28.674
The map. Oh shit.

01:25:43.722 --> 01:25:45.440
I don't know where we are.

01:26:56.294 --> 01:26:58.592
This seems like a nice place.

01:26:59.506 --> 01:27:01.304
Why don't we just stay here?

01:27:04.928 --> 01:27:06.100
Okay.

01:27:13.103 --> 01:27:15.447
It doesn't matter if we just...

01:27:15.731 --> 01:27:17.404
stay here.

01:27:52.058 --> 01:27:54.356
It's Eddie's hawk. Look.

01:28:00.066 --> 01:28:01.067
Come on.

01:28:01.943 --> 01:28:03.115
Come on.

01:28:12.078 --> 01:28:13.751
It's taking us home.

01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:15.423
I told you, didn't I?

01:28:16.333 --> 01:28:17.585
Eddie's home.

01:29:54.097 --> 01:29:56.065
Maybe they're at the barn.

01:30:11.072 --> 01:30:12.915
Eddie?

01:30:17.954 --> 01:30:19.046
Jet!

01:30:19.122 --> 01:30:21.250
Jet. Daisy, it's Jet.

01:30:21.541 --> 01:30:24.169
Oh, Jet!

01:30:24.252 --> 01:30:25.754
Oh, I love you, Jet.

01:30:29.841 --> 01:30:31.218
Look at me, Jet.

01:30:31.384 --> 01:30:32.510
You're bleeding.

01:30:32.719 --> 01:30:34.721
What happened? Look at me.

01:30:36.181 --> 01:30:38.684
And I will never let you go.

01:32:15.739 --> 01:32:17.366
What's up with him?

01:32:25.832 --> 01:32:27.175
He's in the woods.

01:32:27.792 --> 01:32:29.089
Daisy!

01:32:29.169 --> 01:32:30.546
Daisy, be careful!

01:33:18.510 --> 01:33:20.012
Eddie?

01:33:20.804 --> 01:33:22.147
Can you hear me?

01:33:25.266 --> 01:33:26.609
Eddie.

01:33:27.644 --> 01:33:29.146
I need you.

01:33:29.229 --> 01:33:30.481
Please.

01:33:32.315 --> 01:33:34.192
I love you.

01:33:34.609 --> 01:33:36.486
Please.

01:33:40.698 --> 01:33:41.950
Eddie?

01:33:42.117 --> 01:33:43.585
It's me.

01:33:45.370 --> 01:33:46.747
Eddie?

01:33:46.913 --> 01:33:48.540
Eddie, it's okay.

01:33:48.748 --> 01:33:50.591
It's me.

01:33:52.877 --> 01:33:55.346
You're home.

01:33:57.674 --> 01:33:59.472
You're home.

01:34:24.325 --> 01:34:25.372
Before the war,

01:34:25.451 --> 01:34:27.874
I used my willpower
for stupid stuff,

01:34:28.121 --> 01:34:29.714
like not eating chocolate.

01:34:35.670 --> 01:34:38.549
I think I thought
if I could control myself,

01:34:38.923 --> 01:34:42.143
then maybe the world around me
would start to make sense.

01:34:44.596 --> 01:34:46.690
I guess I was
pretty naive back then.

01:34:59.068 --> 01:35:00.945
During the war we all learned

01:35:01.029 --> 01:35:03.782
to stop looking for reasons
why things happen.

01:35:09.996 --> 01:35:11.794
We don't know
what happened to Eddie,

01:35:12.916 --> 01:35:14.543
what he saw...

01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:17.428
the things he had to do.

01:35:19.797 --> 01:35:21.799
His burns and scars
are starting to heal,

01:35:22.926 --> 01:35:24.928
but he hasn't spoken.

01:35:25.011 --> 01:35:26.729
...announcing earlier today

01:35:26.804 --> 01:35:29.148
that a runway at heathrow
is due to reopen.

01:35:29.224 --> 01:35:31.477
The airport will be
working at 10% capacity.

01:35:31.643 --> 01:35:33.145
Officials have also revealed

01:35:33.228 --> 01:35:35.356
that since the ceasefire
was announced,

01:35:35.438 --> 01:35:37.532
electricity services
have returned to normal

01:35:37.607 --> 01:35:39.450
in parts of the south.

01:35:39.567 --> 01:35:42.366
The new government estimates
that within three months,

01:35:42.445 --> 01:35:45.949
80% of the country should have
returned to pre-war levels.

01:35:46.032 --> 01:35:48.706
Rail services are currently
operating at 15%.

01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:57.589
Isaac's gone, isn't he?

01:36:13.434 --> 01:36:15.653
Will Eddie be okay?

01:36:16.688 --> 01:36:18.907
Yeah, he'll be okay.

01:36:20.316 --> 01:36:22.239
He just needs time.

01:36:56.019 --> 01:36:57.441
Now I use my willpower

01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:00.615
to wait for you, Eddie,
to care for you

01:37:01.065 --> 01:37:02.612
and love you.

01:37:04.610 --> 01:37:07.614
I have to believe that one day
you're going to get better.

01:37:14.078 --> 01:37:16.001
Did you finish your drink?

01:37:20.209 --> 01:37:22.928
"Yes, thank you, Daisy.
It was lovely."

01:37:27.592 --> 01:37:29.594
- Oh!

01:37:29.927 --> 01:37:32.021
Ow.
Does it hurt?

01:38:07.173 --> 01:38:08.220
'Cause like I said to you

01:38:08.299 --> 01:38:10.017
all that time ago,

01:38:10.385 --> 01:38:12.308
if the world doesn't end,

01:38:13.137 --> 01:38:14.389
I wanna be here

01:38:14.514 --> 01:38:15.982
at home,

01:38:16.057 --> 01:38:17.684
with you.

01:38:18.518 --> 01:38:20.191
