WEBVTT

00:00.334 --> 00:02.418
Shay has transferred out of 51.

00:02.544 --> 00:04.253
Previously
on "Chicago Fire..."

00:04.380 --> 00:06.422
- You should talk to her.
- She shuts me down.

00:06.548 --> 00:08.007
She'd rather ride around with Devon.

00:08.133 --> 00:10.051
The TV's gone.
What the hell is going on?

00:10.177 --> 00:11.469
I gave Devon a key.

00:11.595 --> 00:13.638
I'm going to shut down 51.

00:13.764 --> 00:16.057
Let's talk about you. And PD.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.976
Yvette!

00:19.103 --> 00:22.063
- Maybe Leon could help us.
- You want Leon to go back in the gang?

00:22.189 --> 00:23.898
- They'll kill him.
- Not if he plays it right.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.234
The truth is, I don't know where
I'd be without you.

00:40.082 --> 00:41.082
Hey.

00:42.876 --> 00:43.960
Hey.

00:46.588 --> 00:48.172
You hungry?

00:48.298 --> 00:51.926
You want me to fry up
some eggs or something?

00:52.052 --> 00:54.137
I mean, not that we have to...

00:54.263 --> 00:56.139
If you have somewhere to be...

00:56.974 --> 00:57.974
Oof.

01:00.310 --> 01:01.853
Gabby?

01:05.107 --> 01:08.443
I had a chance at this a year ago
and I blew it.

01:09.987 --> 01:12.196
I've been regretting it ever since.

01:14.241 --> 01:19.287
So, I'm not about to grab my things
and make up excuses to get out of here.

01:21.957 --> 01:26.586
As far as I'm concerned,
it's our time now.

02:03.165 --> 02:06.209
- You can't be here, Joe.
- I just wanted to see how you're doing.

02:06.335 --> 02:08.544
- I tried calling.
- I'm OK. Just busy.

02:08.670 --> 02:11.881
Listen, Leon... I'm getting married.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.676
- Married? To who?
- Zoya.

02:15.803 --> 02:18.679
- Who's Zoya?
- Hey, man...

02:20.974 --> 02:22.767
Hey, whoa, man!

02:22.893 --> 02:27.063
Get in there. Detective Olinsky.
You can't be here.

02:27.189 --> 02:29.982
- I can't walk down a public street?
- Not here, not this street, not today.

02:30.108 --> 02:33.069
I wouldn't be here if your boy Voight
knew how to work his voicemail.

02:33.195 --> 02:36.280
Don't worry. Leon's in good hands.

02:38.534 --> 02:39.909
Yeah, sure he is.

02:53.924 --> 02:57.218
Oh. That's right.

02:57.344 --> 02:59.470
Hey, have we heard
anything at all from the police?

02:59.596 --> 03:01.973
Or an insurance company or...

03:02.182 --> 03:03.516
It's a good question.

03:03.642 --> 03:05.768
I'm on it, I'm on it.

03:05.894 --> 03:08.104
I filed the claim, and, uh...

03:08.230 --> 03:10.273
You know I'm going to check back in
with the cops today.

03:10.399 --> 03:12.859
But right now, I got to get to West Town
or I'll be late for my shift.

03:12.985 --> 03:15.403
Hey, did you even tell
the cops that it was Devon?

03:15.529 --> 03:17.989
You think I'm protecting her?
She ripped me off, too.

03:18.115 --> 03:19.949
Shay, why don't you come back to 51?

03:20.075 --> 03:21.492
Everybody is asking about you.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.911
You got to graduate high school
sometime, you know?

03:31.962 --> 03:34.922
- Where's Gung-Ho Joe?
- I don't think he's coming back.

03:37.926 --> 03:41.679
McAuley? Aw, man,
I was just getting used to Chout.

03:41.805 --> 03:44.390
Hey, Dawson. What's the deal, Shay sick?

03:44.516 --> 03:48.978
If she's got that nasty bug that's going
around, she is in for a bad time.

03:49.104 --> 03:51.689
- You want a skim latte?
- Sure.

03:51.815 --> 03:54.108
Careful. The lid's not really...

03:55.527 --> 03:57.862
That's great. This is great.
This is great.

03:57.988 --> 04:00.031
One minute into my shift,
I'm already covered in gak.

04:00.157 --> 04:01.574
This is never going to come out.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.618
My wife's gonna freak out on me.

04:05.996 --> 04:08.664
We're going to have a good day today,
McAuley. Think positive.

04:08.790 --> 04:11.042
Don't catastrophize everything.

04:23.513 --> 04:27.725
Oh, my God! You're crazy.

04:27.851 --> 04:29.852
A little, yeah.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.606
Casey, we can't... We can't do this.

04:33.732 --> 04:35.858
Not with that attitude. Come in.

04:43.450 --> 04:46.369
- You're out of your mind.
- You're amazing.

04:52.417 --> 04:56.295
Truck 81,
Ambulance 61, Officer in distress.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.172
Bishop and Huron.

04:59.424 --> 05:03.678
Perfect, first call of the day
and my PIC is MIA.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.309
What are you waiting for?

05:24.366 --> 05:26.534
I told them to tell you no sirens.

05:26.660 --> 05:29.704
Whatever. Lady called us
'cause her cat got stuck on the roof.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.497
Eh... Funny looking cat.

05:31.623 --> 05:33.165
He climbed up to get the cat,

05:33.291 --> 05:34.917
but it ran back inside
and now he's stuck.

05:35.043 --> 05:37.753
You're dead, Becerra!
I'm going to kill you in your sleep!

05:37.879 --> 05:39.547
Yeah,
whatever you say, Tackett.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.173
He didn't want me to call it in.

05:41.299 --> 05:43.467
Hang tight, Tackett!
We'll have you down in no time!

05:43.593 --> 05:46.220
- I don't need your help!
- Well, you heard the man, let's go.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.973
Hey! That's enough.
Let's raise the aerial.

05:49.099 --> 05:50.433
- All right.
- This is a new one.

05:50.559 --> 05:52.184
Get ready for the splat.

05:52.310 --> 05:56.105
Shake a leg, guys, we got
to rescue Reno 911 up there.

06:02.821 --> 06:05.531
I'm fine.
I can get down by myself.

06:09.161 --> 06:11.412
I'm right next to you. Just hold on.

06:12.873 --> 06:13.831
Just hold on!

06:23.175 --> 06:25.259
Help! Please, help!

06:33.310 --> 06:35.061
Help! Hurry!

06:35.187 --> 06:37.980
Mills! Rope bag! Herrmann, Otis, Mouch,
get up on the turntable!

06:38.106 --> 06:40.733
We've got a live wire.
Don't move the aerial.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.781
Tackett! Stop moving!

06:54.956 --> 06:57.083
Tie me a handcuff knot.

06:59.544 --> 07:01.670
- Seconds away.
- Got it.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.925
Yep. Tackett, I need you to feed
your wrists through these loops.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.802
- Can you do that?
- I think so.

07:11.973 --> 07:15.017
Oh, this is bad.
No way this turns out well.

07:15.143 --> 07:16.894
He's dead, paralyzed at the very least.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.562
OK, McAuley, we can't do this all day.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.189
What, acknowledge reality?

07:25.278 --> 07:26.904
Hold on.

07:33.078 --> 07:34.537
Come on, you can do it.

07:35.580 --> 07:38.290
Good. All right, let's lift him up!

07:56.893 --> 07:58.435
We got you!

08:01.898 --> 08:03.399
- You hurt anywhere?
- No.

08:07.612 --> 08:10.489
Hey. Thanks.

08:10.615 --> 08:11.991
You got it.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.834
I haven't watched TV in days.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.502
Please let me pick the channel?

08:23.628 --> 08:27.214
This is not a precedent
I'm eager to set.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.551
Yeah, well, moving in with
Shay and Severide was a huge mistake.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.845
- So find a new place.
- Yeah, but what do I tell them?

08:32.971 --> 08:36.098
Shay feels bad enough about
her gal pal robbing us blind.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.933
I'm not going to pile more guilt on her.

08:38.059 --> 08:41.437
Well, you know, there is another way.

08:43.773 --> 08:49.028
I had a bad living situation once,
but I knew if I walked out

08:49.154 --> 08:51.280
my roommate would
keep my security deposit.

08:51.406 --> 08:54.116
So I simply adopted

08:54.242 --> 08:58.954
a number of,
some might say, irritating habits.

08:59.080 --> 09:03.042
Before long, he was
practically paying me to leave.

09:08.423 --> 09:10.925
Come on! Come on, get it!

09:11.051 --> 09:13.385
- She's got you trained pretty well.
- Huh, nope!

09:14.554 --> 09:17.056
I'm just trying to dodge Casey
so I don't have to fix the toilets.

09:17.182 --> 09:18.557
- Ah, smart.
- Yeah.

09:19.976 --> 09:23.145
What's new with you?
Me? Nothing. Nothing at all.

09:24.522 --> 09:26.774
Actually, I sort of had to
talk to you about something.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.777
- It's just kind of awkward.
- Oh, boy.

09:29.903 --> 09:32.696
Um, I spoke to Isabella yesterday,

09:32.822 --> 09:36.867
and she told me that you guys
sort of hit a sour note.

09:38.161 --> 09:39.453
She told you about that, huh?

09:39.579 --> 09:42.456
My unsolicited opinion?
You're overthinking this.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.250
That is what Boden said.

09:44.376 --> 09:47.378
If enough people tell you you're drunk,
lie down.

09:47.504 --> 09:49.255
You should give her a call.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.342
Yeah, you're right. Um...

09:53.468 --> 09:55.511
And, yes, thank you. This is awkward.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.932
- Hi.
- Somebody's lost.

10:00.058 --> 10:02.101
Hey. Can I help you?

10:02.227 --> 10:04.395
Yeah. I just need to drop this off
real quick. Can I...

10:04.521 --> 10:06.563
Oh, yeah. That is a
good looking beet salad.

10:06.690 --> 10:08.857
Uh, are you sure
you're in the right place?

10:08.984 --> 10:10.859
Oh, I'm sorry. I should
have introduced myself.

10:10.986 --> 10:12.653
I'm Katie. I... I brought lunch.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.863
Cool. Hi, Katie. Are you sure
you're in the right place?

10:14.990 --> 10:17.324
Yeah. I'm Kelly's sister.

10:23.748 --> 10:27.209
Now, the lasagna is vegetarian.
Is that OK?

10:27.335 --> 10:31.422
Uh-oh. What if none of us
are vegetarian?

10:33.216 --> 10:37.219
Ah! I'm just messing with ya.
It smells delicious.

10:39.055 --> 10:42.599
So, Severide, walk me through this.

10:42.726 --> 10:45.269
Your dad and Katie's mom...

10:45.395 --> 10:50.357
You see, Mouch, when a man and a woman
share a special hug...

10:50.483 --> 10:52.651
I understand the plumbing.
I'm just trying to figure out

10:52.777 --> 10:55.195
why Benny would keep
this delightful young lady a secret.

10:55.322 --> 10:58.198
I don't know. You'd have to ask Benny.
Hey, how's the food, guys?

10:58.325 --> 11:01.869
Oh, it's great. The food is magnificent,
Katie, thank you.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.287
Delicious, thanks.

11:03.413 --> 11:06.081
- Good job.
- Woo!

11:11.004 --> 11:12.087
- Paperwork, huh?
- Uh-huh.

11:12.213 --> 11:13.380
Maybe you should take a break.

11:13.506 --> 11:16.300
Think anybody would notice if we draw
the blinds and lock the door?

11:16.426 --> 11:19.178
I don't know. Let's ask Cruz.

11:19.304 --> 11:24.141
Cruz, we're trying to figure out whose
clothes are in the washing machine.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.187
- It's not mine.
- I'll keep asking around.

11:29.773 --> 11:31.231
See ya.

11:36.988 --> 11:38.364
Lieutenant, I don't know what to do.

11:38.490 --> 11:41.075
- Leon?
- I can't go see him. I can't call him.

11:41.201 --> 11:44.411
Voight refuses to keep me in the loop.
I'm going out of my mind here.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.289
Maybe Antonio can help.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.333
Maybe I can get Dawson
to give him a call.

11:51.878 --> 11:56.298
You'd love it. It's this little
neighborhood place over on Wolcott.

11:56.424 --> 11:58.675
Bring your friends by sometime,
I'll hook you up.

11:58.802 --> 12:00.469
- It's called Molly's.
- Sounds cool.

12:00.595 --> 12:01.845
- Yeah.
- Who's Molly?

12:01.971 --> 12:04.098
Now, that's actually
a very interesting story.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.391
So when we bought the place up,

12:05.517 --> 12:08.602
we discovered this old safe
hidden in the wall.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.813
- Ooh.
- Yeah, and, so,

12:10.939 --> 12:16.110
we open up the safe and we discover
these old war medals inside.

12:16.236 --> 12:19.571
And, um, they ended up
belonging to this old guy

12:19.697 --> 12:21.740
who asked us to name the place Molly's.
There you go.

12:21.866 --> 12:24.451
I love that story.

12:28.498 --> 12:30.916
See, that was annoying.

12:31.042 --> 12:33.377
You'll be out of that apartment
in no time.

12:34.796 --> 12:38.048
I've never had a big brother put
the death stare on someone for me.

12:38.174 --> 12:41.927
Oh, he's harmless.
Hey, thanks for doing this.

12:42.053 --> 12:44.930
Sure. All right, I'd better get moving
or I'm going to be late to class.

12:45.056 --> 12:48.183
Go. We'll clean up. I can drop this
stuff by your place tomorrow morning.

12:48.309 --> 12:50.227
Are you sure? Thanks.

12:50.353 --> 12:53.439
And thanks for convincing me
to do this.

12:55.567 --> 12:58.068
- Bye, everybody.
- Bye, Katie. Thank you.

13:02.991 --> 13:05.117
Elbow deep in a pisser. Nice.

13:05.243 --> 13:07.870
Yo, what is up, Antonio?

13:07.996 --> 13:11.165
I got to talk Joe Cruz off the ledge,
but I wanted to come say hi first.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.292
Yeah, well, I would shake
your hand, but...

13:13.418 --> 13:14.626
I'm good, thanks.

13:20.592 --> 13:23.177
What, uh... What's going on, Antonio?

13:23.303 --> 13:25.429
So, you completed the tests
for the Police Department?

13:25.555 --> 13:26.680
Yeah.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.891
Your name's on a list
of prequalified candidates

13:29.017 --> 13:31.894
for the open positions they're going
to announce on the first of the year.

13:32.020 --> 13:34.104
- Positions to be filled by lottery.
- Great.

13:36.191 --> 13:38.317
Well, guess who just won the lottery?

13:41.488 --> 13:44.740
Smile, Mills, you're going to be a cop.

13:49.204 --> 13:52.998
Hey, Devon, uh, it's Leslie again.

13:53.833 --> 13:59.129
Um, look, I...
I don't care why you did it.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.675
I don't care about my things.

14:03.801 --> 14:07.513
But my roommates, you know, I...

14:07.639 --> 14:09.473
I need their stuff back.

14:09.599 --> 14:15.437
So, uh, you know, if I meant,

14:15.563 --> 14:20.734
if I meant anything to you,
um, at all, uh...

14:21.653 --> 14:26.532
Just please, please, please
get me their stuff back.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.076
All right?

14:30.203 --> 14:31.745
Thanks.

14:38.336 --> 14:40.837
- Severide.
- Yeah, Chief.

14:40.964 --> 14:44.591
Just got a call from 25. Shay
still hasn't shown for her shift.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.302
Really? Well, she, you know,

14:47.428 --> 14:49.388
she's still getting used
to that bus route, or...

14:49.514 --> 14:51.932
Do you ever get tired
of making excuses for her?

14:55.937 --> 14:58.480
- I'll call her now.
- Thank you.

15:03.278 --> 15:05.737
Hey, it's Leslie.
Sorry I missed your call.

15:08.199 --> 15:11.868
After Flaco died in that fire, his
cousin stepped up to fill his shoes.

15:11.995 --> 15:12.995
- Doc?
- That's right.

15:13.121 --> 15:15.205
He's calling the shots now
for the Insane Kings.

15:15.331 --> 15:17.291
Before your brother can
become an associate member

15:17.417 --> 15:19.459
he's got to meet with Doc.
You know, kiss the ring.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.296
And you don't think Doc will care
that Leon quit the gang once already?

15:22.422 --> 15:24.881
If it gets dicey,
we'll be nearby, listening in.

15:25.008 --> 15:27.134
This is our chance to get Doc
on record admitting

15:27.260 --> 15:29.219
that he was behind the shooting
that killed Yvette.

15:29.345 --> 15:32.514
Antonio, I grew up with these guys.

15:32.640 --> 15:36.518
Doc is worse than Flaco.
He's always itching to prove himself.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.186
That's why we've got to stop him

15:38.313 --> 15:41.148
before any more kids
get caught in his crossfire.

15:42.317 --> 15:44.026
- When's this happening?
- Within the hour.

15:44.152 --> 15:46.653
- Let Cruz listen in.
- I can't let him in that van.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.780
You brought me along
when you took down Voight.

15:48.906 --> 15:51.241
Well, the guy wearing
the wire that time wasn't your brother.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.118
- Didn't that guy end up dead?
- Unrelated.

15:54.871 --> 15:58.457
That's why we can't bring him along.
You're too close to this, Joe.

15:58.583 --> 16:01.126
Just let us do our job.
We'll take care of Leon.

16:06.132 --> 16:07.633
Will you at least let me know
how it goes?

16:07.759 --> 16:09.718
I'll call you the minute it's over.

16:16.684 --> 16:19.478
Hey, you heard from Shay today?

16:19.604 --> 16:21.938
No, I don't hear from Shay period. Why?

16:22.065 --> 16:23.857
Well, she didn't show up
for work at West Town.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.942
She's not returning my calls.

16:26.069 --> 16:28.737
I don't know what to tell you.
It's the new Shay.

16:30.365 --> 16:33.492
Truck 81,
Squad 3. Ambulance 61.

16:33.618 --> 16:35.494
Person trapped. Superior and Sangamon.

16:42.835 --> 16:43.919
Antonio.

16:44.045 --> 16:46.630
Hey. Come on!

16:50.176 --> 16:52.469
Antonio, it's Casey. How'd it go?

16:54.889 --> 16:57.516
Drive. Yeah.

17:00.269 --> 17:03.438
Leon's fine, but I guess
it got a little squirrelly.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.982
- They didn't get what they need.
- Oh, God.

17:06.109 --> 17:08.985
- He's fine.
- Yeah, you told me.

17:20.164 --> 17:22.124
It's running! It's running!
You have to stop it!

17:22.250 --> 17:23.792
- What's running?
- The trash compactor!

17:23.918 --> 17:25.669
Make it stop! Make it stop!

17:25.795 --> 17:28.296
My husband, he dropped
his cell phone down the trash chute.

17:28.423 --> 17:29.965
He climbed in after it!

17:30.091 --> 17:33.719
Get me out of here!
Somebody help me!

17:33.845 --> 17:35.929
Where's that Halligan?

17:41.018 --> 17:43.603
Somebody! Please! Help!

17:45.148 --> 17:46.273
Sev, did you figure it out?

17:46.399 --> 17:50.444
Nah, I can't reach the ratchet binder
on the side. It's too close to the wall.

17:52.530 --> 17:55.949
- Get the torch!
- I don't hear him anymore!

17:56.075 --> 17:57.993
- Mills!
- I'm trying!

17:58.119 --> 17:59.828
Give me the ax.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.256
This is going to be a disaster.

18:11.382 --> 18:13.717
Worst call of the year. Mark my words.

18:13.843 --> 18:14.968
McAuley, enough!

18:17.472 --> 18:18.972
Be careful.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.349
Hydraulics are putting a lot
of strain on that door!

18:24.145 --> 18:25.353
All right, heads up!

18:26.606 --> 18:27.606
Look out!

18:29.859 --> 18:31.443
What the hell was that about,
Herrmann?

18:31.569 --> 18:34.237
- Just looking out for ya, Clarke.
- Everybody OK? Herrmann?

18:34.363 --> 18:37.032
- Good.
- Let's go. Time to get our hands dirty.

18:42.163 --> 18:44.289
All right, I got him! I got him!

18:45.958 --> 18:48.251
We got a broken femur.
Hey, he's still breathing!

18:48.377 --> 18:50.420
All right, get this under him
and stabilize his spine!

18:53.966 --> 18:57.385
- OK, he's up.
- Got him? Easy.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.599
Oh, boy, here comes a Mercer infection.

19:02.725 --> 19:04.684
McAuley, knock it off!

19:13.069 --> 19:15.153
Why don't you watch where you're going?

19:55.653 --> 19:57.445
Hey, guys, look what I got!

19:57.572 --> 19:59.656
A magical talisman
to keep women away?

19:59.782 --> 20:02.075
No. It's called a djembe.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.911
I got it from my buddy Kevin
over at 66

20:05.037 --> 20:06.705
'cause I always wanted
to learn how to play.

20:09.458 --> 20:10.333
Do you mind?

20:10.459 --> 20:11.293
Oh, don't worry.

20:11.419 --> 20:14.838
I'm only going to practice in
the privacy of my own apartment.

20:17.633 --> 20:18.550
Otis!

20:23.764 --> 20:27.517
- You sure this is going to work?
- I guarantee it. My old roommate?

20:27.643 --> 20:30.562
I annoyed him so much,
he actually punched me in the face.

20:30.688 --> 20:32.647
Wow, OK.

20:58.174 --> 21:02.218
Hey, Pete. Do you know
about Gabby and the Lieutenant?

21:09.560 --> 21:12.395
Yeah, yeah. I got it.

21:14.565 --> 21:15.815
Hello?

21:18.194 --> 21:20.862
You looked like you were
having a good time out there,

21:20.988 --> 21:22.572
but I have a better idea.

21:27.036 --> 21:28.870
I like it already.

21:46.973 --> 21:48.348
Hey, Herrmann.

21:49.892 --> 21:53.436
Tactics for the Fire Officer, huh?
A little light reading?

21:53.562 --> 21:58.316
I'm studying for the Lieutenant's exam
so I can fail it for the fourth time.

21:58.442 --> 22:01.861
How much pressure do you get
from a smooth bore master stream nozzle?

22:01.988 --> 22:03.863
Uh... 100 PSI?

22:03.990 --> 22:08.535
Eighty. You'd get 100 from
a fog master stream nozzle, I think.

22:08.661 --> 22:09.619
Yep.

22:09.745 --> 22:12.831
Damn. You want to take the exam for me?

22:15.042 --> 22:18.044
Thanks for saving my ass back there.
I shouldn't have chewed your head off.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.005
Don't sweat it.

22:28.014 --> 22:31.057
There's this guy, this douche
my wife shacked up with

22:31.183 --> 22:32.600
when we were on the outs.

22:32.727 --> 22:34.769
He's trying to elbow his way
back into the picture.

22:34.895 --> 22:37.605
Oh, brother. Guy can't take a hint?

22:37.732 --> 22:41.151
That's the thing. I think my wife is
sending him mixed signals.

22:41.277 --> 22:42.986
That's too bad.

22:49.535 --> 22:50.994
I don't know why I'm telling you this.

22:54.331 --> 22:56.499
Sometimes, man, I get so worked up

22:56.625 --> 23:01.171
and it's like when you first walk into a
fire and everything goes black,

23:01.297 --> 23:03.173
and you don't know what's
going to happen next.

23:03.299 --> 23:05.842
Yeah, but, Clarke,
if the fire gets bad enough,

23:05.968 --> 23:10.764
and if you know you're too late
to make a save, you bail out, right?

23:12.516 --> 23:14.225
No shame in that.

23:16.020 --> 23:19.272
Yo, Clarke. Severide wants
to jump in the Squad and go for a ride.

23:19.398 --> 23:20.857
Come on, let's go.

23:25.863 --> 23:28.156
Chief, I'm getting out of here.

23:28.282 --> 23:29.783
You need anything before I go?

23:29.909 --> 23:31.493
Uh, no.

23:31.619 --> 23:35.914
Um, did Ms. McLeod
ever call here today?

23:36.040 --> 23:38.750
No. Did you want her to?

23:40.002 --> 23:42.504
No. You have a nice night, Connie.

23:51.430 --> 23:52.931
Shay! You here?

24:03.067 --> 24:04.484
Damn it.

24:07.530 --> 24:09.197
Shay!

24:13.452 --> 24:16.579
Hey, Dawson. Great shift today.

24:16.705 --> 24:19.833
You're very cool under pressure.
I like that in a PIC.

24:20.876 --> 24:24.504
In fact, I put in a request
to be your partner.

24:26.465 --> 24:30.927
I feel pretty good about my chances.
See that? Optimism.

24:31.053 --> 24:32.971
Fingers crossed.

24:38.853 --> 24:42.021
- Dawson, Shay's in the wind.
- What?

24:42.148 --> 24:46.359
I've been dragging my guys
around all night, looking for her.

24:46.485 --> 24:49.028
I'm worried, Dawson.
You should've reached out.

24:49.155 --> 24:51.322
I told you, Kelly. I made my overture.
She chose Devon.

24:51.448 --> 24:55.034
What? She doesn't have Devon anymore.
Devon has her TV.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.871
You know, you have everything you need.
Your brother, your parents.

24:57.997 --> 25:00.748
Shay's family is far away.
She has you and me,

25:00.875 --> 25:03.793
and right now it's not me
that she needs. OK?

25:03.919 --> 25:06.671
OK, OK. OK.

25:09.508 --> 25:12.343
I have some ideas
where she might be. All right?

25:12.469 --> 25:14.012
I'll take it from here. I'll find her.

25:14.138 --> 25:17.223
You better, 'cause I'm sick and tired
of watching you float through life

25:17.349 --> 25:19.559
while your best friend is
down for the count.

25:20.853 --> 25:23.563
Look, whatever happened
between the two of you,

25:23.689 --> 25:25.732
and I don't care
who's right or wrong...

25:27.568 --> 25:29.235
Just fix it.

25:47.421 --> 25:48.838
Otis!

25:48.964 --> 25:52.842
- Oh, sorry, man, I was in the groove.
- You haven't heard from Shay, have you?

25:52.968 --> 25:54.052
You still haven't found her?

25:54.178 --> 25:57.013
No. Dawson's looking for her now.

25:58.474 --> 26:01.809
- If she shows up, get in touch, OK?
- Sure thing.

26:17.284 --> 26:18.201
No luck?

26:18.327 --> 26:21.663
She comes here every day, but they said
they haven't seen her since Tuesday.

26:22.748 --> 26:24.290
I don't know. I'm running out of ideas.

26:24.416 --> 26:27.669
I promised Severide that I'd find her,
but what if I can't?

26:27.795 --> 26:30.296
You will. I'll help you.

26:31.173 --> 26:33.549
- You sure?
- Just tell me where to go.

26:33.676 --> 26:35.760
Nobody knows Shay like you.

26:39.640 --> 26:43.601
Courthouse doesn't take
reservations, so we must wait in line.

26:43.727 --> 26:47.230
And, uh, marriage license cost 60 dollar.

26:47.356 --> 26:48.940
No problem.

26:50.109 --> 26:52.193
Maybe Saturday for ceremony?

26:52.319 --> 26:54.028
They are open in the mornings.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.739
Uh, Saturday works.

27:00.452 --> 27:01.786
Joe?

27:03.289 --> 27:04.747
You're not happy.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.710
We are to be married.

27:19.638 --> 27:22.140
Uh, hey, Zoya,
can you hang on for a second?

27:24.435 --> 27:27.770
That's my little brother.
I'll be right back, OK?

27:33.444 --> 27:35.445
Leon, what are you doing here?

27:35.571 --> 27:38.114
Antonio said you was worried about me.

27:40.784 --> 27:44.329
I heard it, uh...
it didn't go so well with Doc.

27:44.455 --> 27:49.876
It's OK. But, part of my initiation,

27:50.002 --> 27:51.794
he wants me to come along on a hit.

27:51.920 --> 27:54.881
No. Get out.
You don't have to do this anymore.

27:55.007 --> 27:57.717
Whatever heat Voight wants
to bring on me, I'll take it.

27:57.843 --> 28:00.511
I know you would, Joe.

28:00.637 --> 28:04.098
But this is our best shot at nailing Doc
for what he did to Yvette.

28:04.224 --> 28:07.435
- We can make him pay.
- I can't let you do this.

28:10.022 --> 28:14.359
You have to, Joe.
We got to think about that little girl.

28:40.511 --> 28:41.511
- Kelly.
- Hey.

28:41.637 --> 28:43.471
- Hey.
- Your dishes, as promised.

28:43.597 --> 28:46.140
- Oh.
- Honey, who's that?

28:46.266 --> 28:48.810
Oh, uh, this is my mom.
Mom, this is...

28:48.936 --> 28:50.895
Benny Severide's boy.

28:51.021 --> 28:53.106
Um, guilty.

28:54.400 --> 28:59.153
I'm sorry, it's just that you look
so much like he did back when...

29:00.322 --> 29:03.116
- When I met him.
- OK, Mom, this is getting really weird.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.326
It's nice to meet you.

29:05.452 --> 29:08.496
Are you going?
We feel awful we can't make it.

29:10.290 --> 29:11.833
- Am I going where?
- Mom.

29:11.959 --> 29:14.168
Katie's graduation.
From cooking school.

29:14.294 --> 29:15.711
Thanks, Mom. Thanks.

29:15.838 --> 29:17.630
Well, we would go, of course,

29:17.756 --> 29:20.675
but the twins have a volleyball
tournament in South Bend.

29:20.801 --> 29:23.219
Oh, I didn't... Congratulations.

29:23.345 --> 29:26.889
Oh, it's just a dumb little ceremony
with the chef hats and the...

29:27.808 --> 29:30.977
Anyways, thank you for my stuff.
I'll see you.

29:37.609 --> 29:42.405
You having an OK time, Pete?
You just seem a little distracted.

29:42.531 --> 29:45.616
Nah, I'm good. It's just...
I got a lot of stuff going on.

29:45.742 --> 29:50.997
It's just, uh, I'm kind of
facing a difficult career decision,

29:51.123 --> 29:53.791
and I'm feeling a little disloyal
about it.

29:53.917 --> 29:56.002
But I realize that it's...

30:01.091 --> 30:02.758
OK, I know how this looks.

30:02.885 --> 30:05.636
Yeah, like, like you're parading me
in front of Wheeler again?

30:05.762 --> 30:07.555
I didn't know he was going to be here.

30:07.681 --> 30:09.891
You had to know
that there was some chance.

30:10.017 --> 30:13.144
What do I have to do to convince you?
You want to leave?

30:13.270 --> 30:16.230
Let's leave. I know a terrific
steak house right down the street.

30:16.356 --> 30:19.775
I'm serious. I came here
to hang out with you, not Wheeler.

30:20.986 --> 30:21.903
Let's go.

30:24.531 --> 30:26.240
I'll grab our coats.

30:31.455 --> 30:34.832
Peter Mills,
my favorite Chicago firefighter.

30:35.918 --> 30:39.504
- Senator, you remembered my name.
- I'm a politician, that's what I do.

30:39.630 --> 30:41.964
It's actually all I do,
if I'm going to be honest.

30:43.050 --> 30:46.552
Hey, did you hear? I had a great
conversation with Isabella this morning

30:46.678 --> 30:49.680
about maybe coming on
board to run my campaign.

30:49.806 --> 30:52.225
I hope you don't mind if I take her
on the road with me for a while.

30:52.351 --> 30:57.021
No, no. Sorry, the fact is,
we've only been on a couple of dates.

30:57.147 --> 30:58.856
Well, that's interesting,

30:58.982 --> 31:01.817
because my wife has a theory
that Isabella only brought you

31:01.944 --> 31:04.695
to the fundraiser
to curry favor with me.

31:10.911 --> 31:12.537
Known you since you was a shorty.

31:12.663 --> 31:14.080
I never thought you was hard,

31:14.206 --> 31:17.250
but I'm coming around, Leon.
I'm coming around.

31:17.376 --> 31:20.545
- I won't let you down, Doc.
- That's good, that's good.

31:21.713 --> 31:23.214
So, who we hitting?

31:23.340 --> 31:25.758
You ain't gotta worry about that.
Just do what I say.

31:25.884 --> 31:28.094
- Is it the Mobstaz?
- You got a hearing problem?

31:28.220 --> 31:29.220
Don't push it, kid.

31:29.346 --> 31:30.930
Just curious, Doc.
Trying to learn.

31:31.056 --> 31:32.265
What's he doing?

31:32.391 --> 31:35.309
He's trying to get Doc to incriminate
himself in Yvette's death.

31:35.435 --> 31:38.437
He just needs to sit tight and shut up
till they get to the weapons stash.

31:38.564 --> 31:39.689
We'll have them on intent.

31:39.815 --> 31:41.774
How are you going to bust Doc
without outing Leon?

31:41.900 --> 31:44.819
Listen, Cruz, you're only here
because your brother insisted.

31:44.945 --> 31:46.070
Enough with the questions.

31:46.196 --> 31:50.157
These Mobstaz clowns, they've been
trying to chip away at my territory.

31:50.284 --> 31:52.410
I been sending them messages,
but they ain't listening.

31:52.536 --> 31:54.787
That's it. Come on, dirtbag,
keep talking.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.914
- Maybe 'cause they don't hear you.
- Oh, they heard.

31:57.040 --> 32:01.460
Popped one of them two weeks back,
and clipped another one over on Augusta.

32:04.047 --> 32:05.214
You just clipped him?

32:06.508 --> 32:09.010
Dumb kid got in the way.
What are you going to do?

32:10.929 --> 32:13.889
- We got him on murder one.
- He did it.

32:17.144 --> 32:18.728
What the hell is that?

32:21.273 --> 32:22.857
Gun!

32:33.827 --> 32:35.244
Move!

32:37.331 --> 32:38.914
Leon!

32:41.001 --> 32:43.085
Get down!
Get your ass down!

32:43.211 --> 32:45.671
- Police! Let me see your hands!
- Hands where I can see them!

32:45.797 --> 32:49.008
Get down on the ground!
All the way down. Right now!

32:49.134 --> 32:50.468
Leon?

32:51.720 --> 32:54.221
- Get your ass down.
- Oh! I'm hit!

32:54.348 --> 32:56.182
Yeah? You want to get hit again?
Keep talking.

32:58.226 --> 33:00.186
Leon! Leon!

33:00.312 --> 33:02.688
I'm OK, Joe. I'm OK!

33:02.814 --> 33:04.398
Joe. It ain't my blood.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.528
These guys aren't going anywhere.

33:12.324 --> 33:16.035
You're dead, shorty.
You're a dead little snitch.

33:16.161 --> 33:18.162
Guns fired
on the 18th Street Bridge.

33:18.288 --> 33:20.289
Plain clothes officers on the scene.

33:42.437 --> 33:44.271
I should have known to check here first.

33:49.444 --> 33:50.903
I've been looking all over for you.

33:52.197 --> 33:55.950
Then I remembered how much you like
to drive the ambo across this bridge,

33:56.076 --> 33:57.493
even when it takes us way off route.

33:58.662 --> 34:01.080
You think I don't notice this stuff,
but I do.

34:02.916 --> 34:05.000
Look, Dawson,
if this is going to be a lecture...

34:05.127 --> 34:09.922
No lecture, Shay.
Look, I came to apologize.

34:13.176 --> 34:16.679
You asked for my help,
and I didn't show up.

34:18.306 --> 34:20.391
I didn't ask for your help.

34:20.517 --> 34:23.769
No, you basically told me
to go to hell.

34:25.105 --> 34:27.898
But when two friends have gone through
what we've been through,

34:28.024 --> 34:30.526
they can't just say something
like that and really mean it.

34:30.652 --> 34:35.573
And I knew that,
but I pretended like I didn't.

34:39.286 --> 34:40.286
I'm sorry.

34:44.374 --> 34:46.167
I'm sorry, Shay.

34:49.171 --> 34:52.548
Let me make it up to you.
Let me be your friend again.

35:13.195 --> 35:17.573
Michael Couture. Koo-chour?
Did I get that right?

35:19.993 --> 35:22.328
Valerie Aguilera.

35:31.379 --> 35:32.797
Katie Nolan?

36:09.417 --> 36:12.211
That was really sweet of you, Kelly.
You didn't have to do that.

36:12.337 --> 36:16.215
Well, you have a big brother now, and
he wants to buy you a beer to celebrate.

36:16.341 --> 36:17.967
OK.

36:20.095 --> 36:23.556
Yeah. Pretty weird.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.474
Surprise!

36:30.188 --> 36:32.648
Congratulations! Good for you!

36:36.945 --> 36:38.279
Hey.

36:39.948 --> 36:42.992
Come here. I'm proud of you.

36:46.329 --> 36:48.289
Come on! It's a celebration!
Get over here!

36:53.378 --> 36:55.588
Hey. Hey, guys.

36:55.714 --> 36:59.842
Pete, I don't know what you said
to Senator Wheeler,

36:59.968 --> 37:01.969
but I just got the job.

37:03.597 --> 37:06.265
- Congratulations.
- How can I thank you?

37:06.391 --> 37:11.979
- No, that was all you.
- No, Pete. I'm asking for specifics.

37:13.148 --> 37:15.232
What can I do to thank you?

37:21.698 --> 37:23.824
- Let's get out of here.
- OK.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.578
Hey, did you get my message?

37:27.704 --> 37:29.413
Yeah, Dawson found Shay?
That's great.

37:29.539 --> 37:35.294
Yeah. She's OK, or she will be
until she sees that damn bongo drum.

37:35.420 --> 37:39.882
Yeah, listen, uh, the thing is...

37:42.427 --> 37:44.011
I got to...
I got to move out, man.

37:44.137 --> 37:48.349
Um, listen, I'm sorry, it's nothing
personal, I got to find my own space.

37:48.475 --> 37:51.560
No sweat. It's cool. I get it.

37:52.729 --> 37:53.729
OK. OK.

37:57.484 --> 38:02.154
- Otis, where is Joe Cruz?
- I don't know. Is everything OK?

38:02.280 --> 38:06.200
- I need favor of you.
- Sure, anything.

38:06.326 --> 38:09.370
Joe Cruz is a good man.

38:09.496 --> 38:10.704
A very good man.

38:10.830 --> 38:13.123
Yes, yes, he is.

38:14.501 --> 38:15.876
I cannot marry him.

38:17.420 --> 38:20.297
It is me using him,
and that is not right to do.

38:20.423 --> 38:22.466
Well, that's very big of you, Zoya.

38:22.592 --> 38:24.343
Have you discussed this with Joe?

38:24.469 --> 38:28.722
No, I cannot. He would hurt too bad.

38:28.848 --> 38:31.016
That's why you have to hurt him for me.

38:31.142 --> 38:33.143
- No.
- Yes.

38:33.269 --> 38:36.730
- No!
- Yes. You will hurt him for me.

38:40.568 --> 38:42.236
Thank you, Otis.

38:45.281 --> 38:47.950
I'm telling you, it's as strong a case
against Doc and the Kings

38:48.076 --> 38:49.660
as we could hope to get.
He's going down.

38:49.786 --> 38:51.537
- You're sure?
- He's going down.

38:51.663 --> 38:55.124
But he'll always have reach.
So we got to protect Leon.

38:56.042 --> 38:59.670
- Meaning what?
- Cruz, he's got to get out of town.

39:03.383 --> 39:05.634
OK. How long?

39:05.760 --> 39:09.972
For a long time. Like, maybe forever.

39:11.391 --> 39:14.101
No, unacceptable.
What other options we got?

39:14.227 --> 39:16.478
Listen, this is the kind of thing
you want to do right.

39:16.646 --> 39:19.273
That means getting Leon out of town.
Tonight. For good.

39:19.399 --> 39:21.191
Now he says you got an uncle
in Tampa...

39:21.317 --> 39:23.193
- Voight, you son of a bitch.
- Joe, it's OK.

39:23.319 --> 39:24.778
- This is on you.
- You outed him.

39:24.904 --> 39:26.238
You put him in that position!

39:26.364 --> 39:28.449
It could have been a lot worse,
right, Joe?

39:30.076 --> 39:34.163
It's OK. I can go live with Uncle Jorge.
You can visit me there.

39:43.006 --> 39:44.465
Leon...

39:46.176 --> 39:47.551
We did a good thing here.

39:51.473 --> 39:52.931
We did a good thing.

40:14.913 --> 40:16.580
Hey, look who's back!

40:16.706 --> 40:18.415
Hey!

40:18.541 --> 40:20.042
There she is.

40:24.506 --> 40:26.590
Now if you have any problems
or issues or questions,

40:26.716 --> 40:29.384
please do not hesitate to call me
or anyone in my office.

40:29.511 --> 40:32.387
- These are things beyond our control.
- What in the hell is this?

40:32.514 --> 40:35.015
These are the new
assignments for your people.

40:35.141 --> 40:36.350
New assignments?

40:36.476 --> 40:41.355
Yes, as I understand it, Truck 81
and Squad 3 hacked their way

40:41.481 --> 40:45.651
into a 40,000 dollar trash compactor,
rendering it inoperable.

40:45.777 --> 40:48.278
Yeah, in the course
of saving a man's life.

40:48.404 --> 40:52.449
Yes. All the same, the property owner is
now holding the department responsible.

40:52.575 --> 40:53.951
That's not going to fly. You know it.

40:54.077 --> 40:57.371
Whether or not this case goes forward,
Chief,

40:57.497 --> 41:01.458
that liability risk was everything
I needed to convince my bosses.

41:01.584 --> 41:04.920
So, you all have
one more shift together.

41:06.381 --> 41:08.215
Then Firehouse 51
will be closing.
