WEBVTT

00:24.108 --> 00:26.077
It's like,
barely even there.

00:27.444 --> 00:30.280
Yeah, not a
good night for moon tanning.

00:31.783 --> 00:32.948
What?

00:32.950 --> 00:34.051
Moon tan.

00:36.854 --> 00:38.286
- Is that a thing?
- Yeah.

00:38.288 --> 00:40.792
It's like a suntan,
but with the moon.

00:43.727 --> 00:47.595
But, I mean, that's just
sunlight reflecting off the moon,

00:47.597 --> 00:52.069
so it's still just
like, just the sun.

00:53.737 --> 00:55.572
Then why do they
call it moonlight?

00:59.476 --> 01:00.244
I'll be damned.

01:05.315 --> 01:07.384
I don't wanna stay
out here much longer.

01:08.718 --> 01:10.820
I don't wanna get a moon burn.

01:12.656 --> 01:13.490
Oh shit.

01:26.636 --> 01:29.004
Mm, you make the best stew.

01:29.006 --> 01:32.074
- You like it?
- Mmhmm.

01:32.076 --> 01:33.577
Okay, wow.

01:35.745 --> 01:36.580
Why wow?

01:37.915 --> 01:39.181
I'm just surprised,
that's all.

01:39.183 --> 01:40.184
Surprised by what?

01:42.954 --> 01:45.256
I uh, I didn't know
that you liked turtle.

01:47.959 --> 01:49.757
- That's not even funny.
- I'm not being funny.

01:49.759 --> 01:51.659
- Barry, stop.
- I can't stop.

01:51.661 --> 01:53.295
There is a turtle, in your bowl.

01:53.297 --> 01:55.030
- Take it back.
- I can't take it back.

01:55.032 --> 01:56.564
- Take it back.
- I can't take it back.

01:56.566 --> 01:58.169
- Take it back.
- I can't.

01:59.469 --> 02:00.271
Joke's on you.

02:01.371 --> 02:04.106
I love the taste of turtle.

02:04.108 --> 02:04.976
Mm, mm, mm!

02:53.823 --> 02:55.324
Hey, Steve.

02:55.326 --> 02:56.327
Oh, hey Bar.

02:58.561 --> 02:59.529
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

03:00.730 --> 03:03.198
Lovely weather
we're having, today.

03:03.200 --> 03:04.166
What?

03:04.168 --> 03:05.935
The weather, it's nice.

03:05.937 --> 03:09.570
Oh, uh, sure.

03:09.572 --> 03:10.607
Gonna be hot.

03:12.410 --> 03:13.409
What?

03:13.411 --> 03:14.778
It's gonna be hot.

03:16.579 --> 03:19.048
- It's uh, hot every day.
- Yeah.

03:19.050 --> 03:19.883
Humid heat.

03:20.750 --> 03:21.551
Uh huh.

03:23.220 --> 03:28.225
Well, I'm gonna go
inside, cause of the heat.

03:30.361 --> 03:32.794
Right, see you around, huh?

03:32.796 --> 03:33.630
Sure.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.054
Motherfu

03:59.056 --> 04:00.922
Barry Klein does little
more than spit out a line,

04:00.924 --> 04:02.890
as if he's reading a textbook.

04:02.892 --> 04:06.963
His character portrayal
is mind-numbingly dull.

04:08.299 --> 04:11.400
But where Barry Klein is
lacking in his performance,

04:11.402 --> 04:14.103
it's made up for
by the true stars

04:14.105 --> 04:15.970
of the Austin Theater community,

04:15.972 --> 04:19.241
especially in Kimberly Lee's
heartwrenching portrayal

04:19.243 --> 04:21.412
of the grieving mother.

04:23.314 --> 04:24.446
Where does this guy get off?

04:24.448 --> 04:25.913
It's just one man's opinion.

04:25.915 --> 04:26.816
But he's wrong.

04:27.984 --> 04:29.084
Heartwrenching?

04:29.086 --> 04:31.286
Babe, I'm proud of you, okay?

04:31.288 --> 04:33.422
Go out there tonight,
do your thing,

04:33.424 --> 04:35.290
and don't give a shit
about what anybody says,

04:35.292 --> 04:37.761
especially, Steven Dordoff?

04:38.928 --> 04:40.262
Is that even a real name?

04:40.264 --> 04:42.097
Yeah, it's a real name.

04:42.099 --> 04:44.099
A real shitty one.

04:44.101 --> 04:45.136
A real shitty review.

04:46.636 --> 04:47.869
Anyway, I need you to help me

04:47.871 --> 04:49.373
take some pieces into
the gallery today.

04:51.007 --> 04:52.607
- Do I have to?
- Yes, you do.

04:52.609 --> 04:53.875
Why?

04:53.877 --> 04:55.377
'Cause if you don't,
I'll have to kill you.

04:55.379 --> 04:56.978
- Ooh.
- And then,

04:56.980 --> 04:57.945
I'll have to commit suicide.

04:57.947 --> 04:59.316
- Murder suicide.
- Oh, damn.

05:00.251 --> 05:01.485
- Do you want that?
- No.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.018
Do you really
want me to be dead?

05:04.020 --> 05:04.654
No.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.189
Is Jamie gonna be there?

05:07.191 --> 05:08.257
Probably.

05:08.259 --> 05:09.358
Oh, but I don't like her.

05:09.360 --> 05:10.625
Well, you don't like anybody.

05:10.627 --> 05:11.993
Well I especially
don't like her.

05:11.995 --> 05:15.166
Me neither.

05:22.073 --> 05:23.037
- Whoa.
- Whoa, watch it!

05:23.039 --> 05:23.740
Jesus.

05:24.841 --> 05:26.674
Fuckin' Californians.

05:56.673 --> 05:57.508
Hey Susie.

05:58.542 --> 06:01.878
Hi Phyl, sorry I
didn't see you there.

06:05.014 --> 06:05.947
Is Jamie here?

06:05.949 --> 06:08.584
Yup, she's in the back.

06:08.586 --> 06:09.951
Fuckin' hell, here.

06:09.953 --> 06:11.085
Take these.

06:11.087 --> 06:12.753
- No, just...
- I'm stayin' here.

06:12.755 --> 06:13.589
With her?

06:13.591 --> 06:15.725
Yeah, with me?

06:18.429 --> 06:19.263
Make it quick.

06:26.703 --> 06:27.770
Oh my God.

06:28.905 --> 06:30.207
It's gorgeous.

06:31.242 --> 06:32.707
The last stuff you
brought in was garbage,

06:32.709 --> 06:34.876
but this is really nice.

06:34.878 --> 06:35.877
Thanks.

06:35.879 --> 06:38.247
I've been inspired recently.

06:38.249 --> 06:39.082
It shows.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.217
Whatcha readin'?

06:42.219 --> 06:43.052
A story.

06:44.588 --> 06:46.557
No shit, a story?

06:47.891 --> 06:48.725
Uh huh.

06:50.894 --> 06:52.429
What's it about?

06:53.663 --> 06:57.098
Okay, so this
couple's been together

06:57.100 --> 07:01.270
since high school, and she got
an incurable blood disease,

07:01.272 --> 07:02.737
and she died.

07:02.739 --> 07:04.972
You know, sell a few of these
and you'll be a real artist.

07:04.974 --> 07:07.242
I am a real artist.

07:07.244 --> 07:09.777
What?

07:09.779 --> 07:14.784
Before that, her husband,
or boyfriend, or whatever,

07:17.254 --> 07:20.422
he's like a photographer, and
so he went to the hospital,

07:20.424 --> 07:23.758
and took pictures of her, in
the last days of her life.

07:23.760 --> 07:26.495
You know, with like,
the black and white,

07:26.497 --> 07:28.599
and the light, and shit?

07:30.634 --> 07:32.833
I have a house full
of art that I made

07:32.835 --> 07:34.035
with my own two hands.

07:34.037 --> 07:35.870
This is an actual piece
of art that I made,

07:35.872 --> 07:37.071
I am a real artist.

07:37.073 --> 07:38.440
Why are you
trying to fight me?

07:38.442 --> 07:39.541
I'm not.

07:39.543 --> 07:42.313
I mean, that is
so fucking romantic.

07:43.614 --> 07:47.815
I wish that my boyfriend put
half that effort into anything.

07:47.817 --> 07:49.284
I don't have time for this.

07:49.286 --> 07:50.851
I have a huge fucking
gallery opening tomorrow,

07:50.853 --> 07:52.119
which maybe you know
something about,

07:52.121 --> 07:54.389
because your art
is hanging in it.

07:54.391 --> 07:57.725
I have a shit ton of work
to do to get ready for it.

07:57.727 --> 08:00.895
All right, can I help you?

08:00.897 --> 08:03.132
Yeah, that would
actually be really great.

08:04.335 --> 08:05.802
Some girls just
have all the luck.

08:07.837 --> 08:08.838
But she's dead.

08:10.039 --> 08:10.873
Your point?

08:13.544 --> 08:15.577
Barry, what are
you doing here?

08:15.579 --> 08:17.548
Jamie, nice to see you.

08:19.583 --> 08:21.015
All right, don't be mad.

08:21.017 --> 08:22.216
What?

08:22.218 --> 08:24.087
I think I'm gonna stay here
and help with the opening.

08:25.855 --> 08:26.657
You sure?

08:27.691 --> 08:29.993
She seems particularly
vicious today.

08:30.827 --> 08:32.594
Yes, and yes.

08:32.596 --> 08:36.498
Okay, well, I would
offer to stay and help,

08:36.500 --> 08:39.934
but I hate her, and I
don't wanna do that.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.869
All right, break a leg.

08:41.871 --> 08:42.706
I'll try.

08:54.183 --> 08:55.182
Hey.

08:55.184 --> 08:56.017
Oh, hey Barry.

08:56.019 --> 08:57.184
Did you see the review?

08:57.186 --> 08:58.021
Yep.

09:00.189 --> 09:02.293
- I'm gonna go get dressed.
- You're so talented.

09:06.463 --> 09:07.562
Hey man.

09:07.564 --> 09:08.863
Hey, Barry.

09:08.865 --> 09:10.231
Did you see the review, man?

09:10.233 --> 09:12.033
Yeah, I saw the review.

09:12.035 --> 09:13.102
Damn, well,

09:14.705 --> 09:15.639
We'll talk later.

09:26.282 --> 09:27.449
Oh, come on, guys.

09:27.451 --> 09:30.385
Oh, sorry Bar.

09:30.387 --> 09:31.622
Hey, Barry.

09:32.656 --> 09:34.491
Kim, David.

09:35.726 --> 09:36.959
Did you see the review?

09:39.295 --> 09:40.129
Yep.

09:42.098 --> 09:43.099
Can't win 'em all.

09:45.168 --> 09:46.002
Nope.

09:47.771 --> 09:50.605
We're uh, we're gonna, we're
just gonna get outta your hair,

09:50.607 --> 09:52.973
let you have the
space to prepare.

09:52.975 --> 09:54.308
Thanks.

09:54.310 --> 09:58.012
Oh, look, fuck that
guy, am I right?

09:58.014 --> 09:59.348
- Yeah.
- Right.

09:59.350 --> 10:00.351
No, no no.

10:02.952 --> 10:04.120
Fuck that guy.

10:07.290 --> 10:08.457
Yeah.

10:08.459 --> 10:09.957
Break a leg.

10:09.959 --> 10:12.095
Where'd she, uh, where'd she go?

10:19.936 --> 10:20.868
Hi, are you Tom?

10:20.870 --> 10:22.038
- Yep, Phyllis?
- Yes.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.340
Thank you.

10:26.342 --> 10:27.778
- No problem, headin' south?
- Yessir.

10:46.996 --> 10:50.131
I've been very
into manifesting, lately.

10:50.133 --> 10:51.800
What's that?

10:51.802 --> 10:54.503
Manifesting,
like vision boards?

10:54.505 --> 10:57.304
It's all about the
laws of attraction.

10:57.306 --> 10:59.841
There's this higher
plane of existence,

10:59.843 --> 11:02.209
where your desires
are not just a wish,

11:02.211 --> 11:05.547
but they're actually reality.

11:05.549 --> 11:08.850
Identifying your visions,
and giving them clarity,

11:08.852 --> 11:12.353
and then focusing
on that clarity,

11:12.355 --> 11:14.890
will manifest what you
truly want in life.

11:14.892 --> 11:17.526
If you refuse the outside
world, and prevent it

11:17.528 --> 11:20.027
from distracting you
from your intentions,

11:20.029 --> 11:22.533
you can achieve
anything you want.

11:23.734 --> 11:25.334
That's how I got this part.

11:26.437 --> 11:29.038
That sounds like bullshit.

11:30.273 --> 11:31.274
It's not.

11:32.443 --> 11:35.744
I read it in a
book, and it works.

11:35.746 --> 11:37.211
That's how I got this part.

11:37.213 --> 11:39.046
You got this part
because you were sl...

11:39.048 --> 11:44.084
Right, well, I wanna
congratulate everybody,

11:44.086 --> 11:46.555
on a very successful run.

11:46.557 --> 11:49.223
Speech!

11:49.225 --> 11:54.197
Um, I know some of you have
probably read the reviews,

11:55.364 --> 12:00.269
but I wanna say that
I'm proud of you.

12:04.641 --> 12:09.078
In a time when space is limited,
it's, you know, hey, hey,

12:13.650 --> 12:15.983
♪ All the world is but a stage ♪

12:23.494 --> 12:26.930
Life, life is a performance.

12:29.465 --> 12:30.634
Life is love.

12:32.636 --> 12:35.404
Art, art is love.

12:38.509 --> 12:39.943
Love art, and you love life.

12:41.477 --> 12:44.515
More importantly,
love art in yourself.

13:07.704 --> 13:10.005
Mm, you're home.

13:10.007 --> 13:11.338
You fell asleep.

13:11.340 --> 13:13.610
- Yep.
- Come on, let's go to bed.

13:15.211 --> 13:16.045
Carry me.

13:16.980 --> 13:18.045
Okay, but piggy-back style.

13:18.047 --> 13:19.683
- Really?
- Yeah, let's do it.

13:21.685 --> 13:25.554
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:10.266 --> 14:11.100
How's this?

14:12.903 --> 14:14.268
Great.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.236
Do I look like a
relaxed and friendly guy?

14:16.238 --> 14:17.204
Yes.

14:17.206 --> 14:19.009
Do I look like a hipster dad?

14:20.176 --> 14:21.408
Yes.

14:21.410 --> 14:22.244
Good.

14:34.223 --> 14:35.025
Barry?

14:39.029 --> 14:40.931
- Stand on the X.
- Yeah.

14:46.202 --> 14:49.070
Okay, look straight into the
camera, and slate your name.

14:49.072 --> 14:50.371
Barry Klein.

14:50.373 --> 14:52.539
Hands and two
profiles, please.

14:52.541 --> 14:53.910
Um, no, hands first.

15:05.388 --> 15:06.888
Okay, great.

15:06.890 --> 15:08.990
And the agency wants to
see a little personality,

15:08.992 --> 15:10.391
get to know you a bit.

15:10.393 --> 15:12.794
So I'm gonna ask you a question,
and I want you to answer

15:12.796 --> 15:14.595
straight to the lens.

15:14.597 --> 15:18.001
And try to be helpful, but not
pushy and standoffish, okay?

15:19.002 --> 15:21.069
What's in your
refrigerator right now?

15:21.071 --> 15:25.807
Oh God, um, eggs, cheese
slices, almond milk,

15:25.809 --> 15:29.178
um, oh, half a box of wine.

15:31.148 --> 15:33.982
I don't drink wine,
personally, but my wife does,

15:33.984 --> 15:36.017
and she likes to take
the bag out of the box,

15:36.019 --> 15:38.318
and just drink it
straight from the spout.

15:38.320 --> 15:40.256
She calls it her
adult juice box.

15:41.091 --> 15:41.858
Okay, great.

15:43.626 --> 15:44.859
Do you think
this guy looks sad?

15:44.861 --> 15:48.462
I don't like his
hair very much.

15:48.464 --> 15:50.197
Um, ask him a
different question,

15:50.199 --> 15:52.934
and this time can he not be
so sad-looking in the eyes?

15:52.936 --> 15:55.837
And ask him if he'd
be willing to shave.

15:55.839 --> 15:56.707
I love shaving.

15:59.675 --> 16:00.709
Are you willing to shave?

16:00.711 --> 16:03.312
I yal, I, yes, I'll shave.

16:05.148 --> 16:07.481
Okay, let's try that
again, and this time,

16:07.483 --> 16:10.551
try not to be so pouty
and sad in the eyes, okay?

16:10.553 --> 16:12.453
They don't want
you to be pathetic.

16:12.455 --> 16:13.289
You're happy!

16:14.891 --> 16:17.691
So, you'll shave, if you
were offered this part?

16:17.693 --> 16:19.796
I would shave if I
was offered the part.

16:20.964 --> 16:22.197
That's as good
as it's gonna get.

16:22.199 --> 16:23.697
Let's move on.

16:23.699 --> 16:25.133
Good.

16:25.135 --> 16:27.037
And Barry, what's your
favorite thing in the world?

16:28.038 --> 16:32.406
Hm.

16:47.157 --> 16:48.722
Hey Barry.

16:48.724 --> 16:50.526
God, you scared
the shit outta me.

16:52.929 --> 16:54.363
Do you like this painting?

16:57.167 --> 16:58.565
It's different.

16:58.567 --> 16:59.401
It's mine.

17:02.705 --> 17:03.739
I should've known.

17:09.946 --> 17:10.847
You're Phyllis.

17:11.915 --> 17:13.514
Yep.

17:13.516 --> 17:15.518
Hm, thought it was that lady.

17:20.190 --> 17:21.256
No.

17:21.258 --> 17:22.225
You're an artist?

17:23.292 --> 17:24.127
I am.

17:27.931 --> 17:28.764
What is it?

17:30.033 --> 17:32.599
They're um, they're collages.

17:32.601 --> 17:33.769
Oh, like a scrapbook.

17:35.471 --> 17:37.538
More like an assemblage
of different forms,

17:37.540 --> 17:40.241
and different techniques,
that when utilized together,

17:40.243 --> 17:42.913
make a wholly new,
unique work of art.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.481
What do they mean?

17:46.649 --> 17:48.717
They can mean whatever
you want them to mean.

17:49.752 --> 17:50.586
That's art.

17:52.956 --> 17:55.924
What does art mean to you?

17:55.926 --> 18:00.831
Well, good art is an expression,
where you share the world

18:03.599 --> 18:08.303
to someone in a way that,
maybe they've known, but um,

18:08.305 --> 18:09.738
never really experienced.

18:13.475 --> 18:16.079
Have you experienced the
world in a way I haven't?

18:20.183 --> 18:22.683
I don't, I don't know.

18:22.685 --> 18:24.185
Okay.

18:24.187 --> 18:25.856
Well, bye.

18:43.772 --> 18:45.439
Stop eating so much cheese.

18:45.441 --> 18:47.610
I can eat as much
cheese as I wanna eat.

18:48.644 --> 18:50.111
I can see
what they're goin' for,

18:50.113 --> 18:52.546
but it's just not there.

18:52.548 --> 18:55.283
Yeah, she's really
struggling to be someone,

18:55.285 --> 18:59.320
instead of just embracing
the chaos of uncertainty.

18:59.322 --> 19:02.456
Right, you can tell that
the artist is conflicted,

19:02.458 --> 19:04.560
has no idea what she's doing.

19:05.794 --> 19:07.628
Plus, it's
just boring, mediocre,

19:07.630 --> 19:09.798
and lacks any kind of identity.

19:11.067 --> 19:13.134
- Eh, it's garbage.
- Total garbage.

19:13.136 --> 19:16.907
No, no, but it's
actually garbage, though.

19:18.041 --> 19:20.341
It's got, like,
pieces of trash in it.

19:20.343 --> 19:22.843
Huh, would you look at that.

19:22.845 --> 19:23.844
Oh, God.

19:47.037 --> 19:48.238
Barry, we're leaving.

19:51.041 --> 19:52.706
- Where are you going?
- Home.

19:52.708 --> 19:53.776
You can't take that.

19:58.281 --> 19:59.115
Fuck you.

20:11.727 --> 20:13.794
Oh, hey, whoa whoa whoa
whoa, what's up, what's up?

20:13.796 --> 20:15.129
I can't get my shoe off!

20:15.131 --> 20:17.968
- Okay, okay, this shoe?
- Yes this shoe,

20:18.767 --> 20:21.269
Barry, yes, this shoe.

20:21.271 --> 20:24.738
Hey, you don't have
to cry about a shoe.

20:24.740 --> 20:26.140
I can cry if I want.

20:26.142 --> 20:29.776
No, yes, yes yes
yes, you can, you can.

20:29.778 --> 20:31.914
But don't cry here.

20:33.149 --> 20:35.482
This is a terrible place to cry.

20:35.484 --> 20:37.484
There's good places to cry
and there's bad places to cry,

20:37.486 --> 20:39.755
and this is a terrible,
bad place to cry.

21:12.355 --> 21:14.590
I shoulda
gotten a job in finance.

21:15.958 --> 21:17.657
Like taxes, and shit?

21:17.659 --> 21:18.495
Uh huh.

21:22.198 --> 21:23.364
You don't think I could do it.

21:23.366 --> 21:24.465
Mm mm.

21:24.467 --> 21:26.169
No, you're not cut out for that.

21:27.203 --> 21:28.637
I'm not cut out for acting.

21:30.306 --> 21:33.174
We're just a couple
of talentless hacks.

21:33.176 --> 21:35.276
No, we're not talentless.

21:35.278 --> 21:36.945
They're tasteless and tactless.

21:41.617 --> 21:44.718
Y'know, I was feelin'
pretty bad, there.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.555
Cause I was getting
all the criticism.

21:47.823 --> 21:49.490
But now that you're
the worst artist,

21:51.026 --> 21:54.997
and I'm the worst actor, we're
like, at the top of our game.

22:00.203 --> 22:01.471
It's different with art.

22:03.139 --> 22:05.808
You could get a bad review
cause of a shitty director.

22:07.810 --> 22:10.045
With art, it's just me.

22:14.084 --> 22:16.716
So you think people
are the problem?

22:16.718 --> 22:19.019
Yes, people are
absolutely the problem.

22:19.021 --> 22:21.757
Like, I wanna get away
from all the people.

22:24.260 --> 22:25.594
I could take a vacation.

22:26.728 --> 22:27.564
Go to the beach.

22:29.432 --> 22:30.766
Sand in the toes.

22:32.102 --> 22:33.869
Sun rising above the Gulf.

22:35.238 --> 22:37.671
Is there such a thing
as a vacation from people?

22:37.673 --> 22:40.408
Like, get me away
from all the people

22:40.410 --> 22:42.445
for a little bit, I'm good.

22:48.284 --> 22:49.783
Is that what you truly want?

22:49.785 --> 22:51.554
I truly want that, yes.

22:52.455 --> 22:53.256
Manifest it.

22:55.958 --> 22:57.458
Manifest it.

22:57.460 --> 23:00.230
You put it out in the universe,
and it becomes reality.

23:01.531 --> 23:03.397
- Yeah?
- Mmhmm.

23:03.399 --> 23:04.234
Okay.

23:08.804 --> 23:13.407
Oh, cosmic universe, unburden me

23:13.409 --> 23:18.078
from the plague of
societal obligation.

23:18.080 --> 23:20.716
Rid the planet of
all the people.

23:23.253 --> 23:26.054
I eschew the naysayers,
and the critics,

23:27.756 --> 23:31.561
and let me live out my
final days in solitude.

23:32.495 --> 23:33.329
With Barry.

23:36.798 --> 23:40.170
Did it work?

23:42.838 --> 23:44.338
I don't, I really don't know,

23:44.340 --> 23:46.174
cause I don't speak the
language of the universe.

23:46.176 --> 23:47.908
Oh my.

23:47.910 --> 23:49.912
Well, it's worth a shot.

23:55.117 --> 23:56.816
Did you have
any dreams last night?

23:56.818 --> 23:58.685
Yes, one.

23:58.687 --> 24:00.588
- You were a turtle.
- I've always wanted

24:00.590 --> 24:03.426
- to be a turtle.
- And I was a dove.

24:05.160 --> 24:08.296
But I was in a house, in a
cage, and you were outside,

24:08.298 --> 24:10.130
and you weren't in a cage.

24:10.132 --> 24:14.302
But you were walking by,
slowly, because you're a turtle.

24:14.304 --> 24:16.038
And I was singing like an angel.

24:17.340 --> 24:18.939
And you heard me
through an open window,

24:18.941 --> 24:20.106
and you fell in love with me,

24:20.108 --> 24:22.510
even though you couldn't see me.

24:22.512 --> 24:23.843
And you were outside and free,

24:23.845 --> 24:25.546
and could do
whatever you wanted.

24:25.548 --> 24:29.650
Go to Greece, or Antarctica.

24:29.652 --> 24:32.852
- Do turtles like the cold?
- Doesn't matter,

24:32.854 --> 24:34.988
cause you didn't go.

24:34.990 --> 24:36.823
You started climbing the
front stairs of the house,

24:36.825 --> 24:37.793
straight to me.

24:39.828 --> 24:41.362
But your little turtle
legs were too short

24:41.364 --> 24:43.364
to make it up the stairs.

24:43.366 --> 24:44.866
But you tried, anyway.

24:47.069 --> 24:47.903
Forever.

24:50.906 --> 24:52.140
Until you died.

24:54.410 --> 24:56.144
I don't think I
like your dream.

24:58.381 --> 25:01.049
Well it's my dream, not yours.

25:03.386 --> 25:04.219
True.

25:19.335 --> 25:21.269
Hey, babe, I think they forgot

25:21.271 --> 25:23.337
to deliver the
paper this morning.

25:23.339 --> 25:25.238
I'm gonna run to the store.

25:25.240 --> 25:26.074
Okay.

27:30.899 --> 27:32.535
- Hey babe?
- Mmhmm?

27:33.803 --> 27:35.036
Is it a holiday?

27:36.371 --> 27:37.473
Nope.

27:46.381 --> 27:48.582
Weird.

27:48.584 --> 27:49.419
Why?

27:50.853 --> 27:54.254
Well, the store was closed,
and there's nobody outside.

27:54.256 --> 27:55.591
What do you mean, nobody?

28:41.303 --> 28:42.137
Steve?

29:50.973 --> 29:53.541
Hi, this is Jamie,
with Artists' Space gallery.

29:53.543 --> 29:55.678
Leave me a message and
I'll call you back.

29:57.345 --> 29:58.548
Straight to voicemail.

30:35.651 --> 30:36.719
It's impossible.

30:37.987 --> 30:38.754
Apparently not.

30:42.157 --> 30:44.492
But, we were joking.

30:45.661 --> 30:47.029
It was a joke!

30:48.096 --> 30:48.898
Evidently not.

30:56.739 --> 30:59.107
Was, was there an evacuation?

31:02.243 --> 31:04.446
We would've heard
about it, wouldn't we?

31:17.927 --> 31:19.394
Maybe, we're hallucinating.

31:23.231 --> 31:25.300
We're both hallucinating
the same thing?

31:37.245 --> 31:38.413
Maybe it's a dream.

31:40.281 --> 31:45.286
And my mind is telling me
you're here, and I can feel you,

31:49.659 --> 31:51.994
but I can't actually feel you.

31:56.065 --> 31:56.832
Maybe?

32:00.502 --> 32:02.772
No, but when you
dream, you don't,

32:03.839 --> 32:05.139
you don't know
you're having a dream

32:05.141 --> 32:06.439
when you're in the dream.

32:06.441 --> 32:08.610
You don't know you had a
dream until you wake up.

32:11.279 --> 32:12.948
And you've already
had it, right?

32:14.950 --> 32:16.950
Then what the fuck is it?

33:57.887 --> 33:58.686
Fuck.

35:29.777 --> 35:30.612
Hey Bar?

35:31.813 --> 35:32.647
Barry.

35:34.884 --> 35:35.717
Bar.

35:54.535 --> 35:55.371
Barry?

36:36.678 --> 36:37.512
Phyl?

36:38.513 --> 36:39.348
Phyl?

36:40.581 --> 36:42.418
Oh my God!

36:45.720 --> 36:47.222
What's goin' on?

36:51.360 --> 36:53.726
Why is your hair wet?

36:53.728 --> 36:55.395
Did you know there's a
creek behind the house?

36:55.397 --> 36:57.366
- What?
- It's wild.

37:08.410 --> 37:10.578
If this is what
the world is like,

37:12.247 --> 37:14.083
then we're all that we have.

37:16.452 --> 37:18.553
I know, I know.

37:49.617 --> 37:50.850
Now what do we do?

37:57.625 --> 37:59.792
Whatever the fuck we want.

39:13.168 --> 39:14.733
Tell me a story.

39:14.735 --> 39:16.505
About what?

39:17.339 --> 39:19.738
Anything.

39:19.740 --> 39:20.576
Okay.

39:23.345 --> 39:25.247
Mm, got it.

39:26.881 --> 39:28.747
This is an old one, so
stop me if you've heard it.

39:28.749 --> 39:29.585
'Kay.

39:33.355 --> 39:35.455
It was a particularly
uneventful night,

39:35.457 --> 39:37.022
in the dead of winter.

39:37.024 --> 39:39.259
A man was traveling
along a mountain path,

39:39.261 --> 39:41.428
when the breeze
boasted to the hot sun,

39:41.430 --> 39:44.264
that it was truly the
stronger of the two.

39:44.266 --> 39:47.267
I can topple
trees, bury ships in the sea,

39:47.269 --> 39:50.403
and raise tidal waves larger
than the tallest mountains,

39:50.405 --> 39:54.039
that can devastate even
the mightiest of cities.

39:54.041 --> 39:55.875
The sun laughed.

39:55.877 --> 39:57.310
And of course, we
all know that the sun

39:57.312 --> 39:59.613
is the most powerful
thing in the solar system.

39:59.615 --> 40:00.449
Right.

40:01.416 --> 40:03.452
You dare tempt me, Wind?

40:04.386 --> 40:07.420
See that weary man, far below?

40:07.422 --> 40:10.923
Let us see who can take
the coat off that man.

40:10.925 --> 40:14.561
If you can, you are
truly the greatest.

40:14.563 --> 40:16.496
That is simple.

40:16.498 --> 40:19.166
The breeze
swelled, and blew hard.

40:19.168 --> 40:22.101
The man clung hard to his
coat, and no matter how strong

40:22.103 --> 40:24.304
the wind blew, he
never relented.

40:24.306 --> 40:26.972
He only shivered,
pulled his coat tighter.

40:26.974 --> 40:29.909
The sun stepped out from
behind a cloud, and grew.

40:29.911 --> 40:32.978
Its heat warmed the air,
and the frosty ground.

40:32.980 --> 40:34.447
The snow melted.

40:34.449 --> 40:37.584
The leaves of the trees
shriveled, and turned to dust.

40:37.586 --> 40:41.655
The man grew hot, and sought
refuge in the shade of a hill.

40:41.657 --> 40:44.624
He took off his
coat, and rested.

40:44.626 --> 40:46.528
The breeze was dumbfounded.

40:47.529 --> 40:50.630
How did you do that?

40:50.632 --> 40:53.935
Not with force,
but with gentleness.

40:58.973 --> 41:00.473
Then what?

41:00.475 --> 41:04.346
Well, that's kinda the
end of the story, I guess.

41:05.813 --> 41:07.048
But what about the man?

41:08.849 --> 41:10.718
He dies, eventually.

41:11.819 --> 41:12.820
Shit.

41:21.896 --> 41:23.463
I'd be doing a show,

41:23.465 --> 41:26.335
and I would remember everything
about the performance,

41:27.302 --> 41:29.001
leading up to it.

41:29.003 --> 41:30.970
And then I would
sort of, come to,

41:30.972 --> 41:33.072
as the audience was clapping.

41:33.074 --> 41:37.142
Like there was a void in my
memory of the entire show.

41:37.144 --> 41:38.744
Kinda like when
you're driving,

41:38.746 --> 41:40.313
and you get to your destination,

41:40.315 --> 41:41.681
but you don't
remember the drive?

41:41.683 --> 41:43.050
Yeah, like that.

41:44.686 --> 41:46.688
There's a sorta high, I guess.

41:49.890 --> 41:50.858
That's what I liked.

41:52.394 --> 41:54.361
You could perform for me.

41:54.363 --> 41:55.196
A private show?

41:56.665 --> 41:58.598
The whole
world's our private show.

41:58.600 --> 41:59.401
Huh.

42:03.372 --> 42:05.672
I should've picked a
more manly profession.

42:05.674 --> 42:07.840
Like a hunter.

42:07.842 --> 42:09.278
Or a lumberjack.

42:27.962 --> 42:31.130
Have you ever climbed a tree?

42:31.132 --> 42:33.098
You don't think I can?

42:33.100 --> 42:35.470
- Mm.
- Watch this.

42:38.105 --> 42:41.576
Yeah,
what's your first step?

42:46.213 --> 42:49.316
It's a gesture.

42:49.318 --> 42:52.987
You invite the viewer
to move about the piece.

42:55.657 --> 42:57.258
They become an explorer.

42:58.627 --> 43:01.728
Dipping in and out of
thought, through the nooks

43:01.730 --> 43:06.735
and the crannies, shifting in
and out of light, and color.

43:11.773 --> 43:13.906
It's not meant to be one thing,

43:13.908 --> 43:17.746
but a complex collection
of a variety of thoughts.

43:18.979 --> 43:23.452
Like a troubled, noisy
mind, frozen in a moment.

43:25.754 --> 43:28.357
The individual pieces
alone, are unique.

43:29.758 --> 43:34.128
And taken in as a whole can
seem messy, but take a step back

43:36.130 --> 43:38.600
and the whole of the thing
comes together as one.

43:51.513 --> 43:54.848
Wait, I think
I know where we are.

43:54.850 --> 43:56.483
Oh yeah?

43:56.485 --> 43:58.350
I know
this smell anywhere.

43:58.352 --> 44:00.522
Okay, open 'em.

44:02.356 --> 44:04.990
Oh yeah, it definitely
smells like mildew

44:04.992 --> 44:06.026
and urine in here.

44:06.994 --> 44:07.863
Wait for it.

44:14.001 --> 44:16.471
Your co-star.

44:17.873 --> 44:22.878
Okay, what
do you wanna see?

44:23.412 --> 44:24.677
Anything.

44:24.679 --> 44:27.014
Maybe something you
remember from before.

44:28.750 --> 44:32.987
All right, um, oh, I got it.

44:34.922 --> 44:36.924
The scene takes place
outside of a cafe.

44:37.859 --> 44:39.492
I was waiting.

44:39.494 --> 44:41.728
I was waiting on you, actually.

44:41.730 --> 44:44.163
And this stranger came up to me.

44:44.165 --> 44:48.002
She said, uh, well she said

44:49.538 --> 44:50.770
"Excuse me,

44:50.772 --> 44:53.338
"do you know what
time brunch ends?"

44:53.340 --> 44:56.375
And I was like, I don't know.

44:56.377 --> 44:59.046
And she said "You don't know?"

45:01.015 --> 45:02.114
No.

45:02.116 --> 45:03.750
"How can you work at a
place that serves brunch

45:03.752 --> 45:05.117
"and not even know
what time it ends?

45:05.119 --> 45:07.186
"Isn't that like your
one fucking job?"

45:07.188 --> 45:08.120
I don't work here.

45:08.122 --> 45:10.122
"You look like you work here."

45:10.124 --> 45:11.390
What?

45:11.392 --> 45:12.625
"You're wearing
that black shirt,

45:12.627 --> 45:14.261
"and you're standing
by the door, so..."

45:16.397 --> 45:19.634
If I worked here, wouldn't
I be inside, working?

45:20.869 --> 45:22.301
"Look man, I don't know you,

45:22.303 --> 45:24.369
"you could be on your
break or something."

45:24.371 --> 45:25.572
I'm just waiting for someone.

45:25.574 --> 45:28.475
"Oh my God, would you calm down?

45:28.477 --> 45:30.543
"It's just a simple
fucking question."

45:30.545 --> 45:32.110
To somebody that
doesn't know the answer.

45:32.112 --> 45:35.082
"Jesus, Yelp was right,
this place is horrible.

45:36.818 --> 45:38.317
"And you know what, just go back

45:38.319 --> 45:41.253
"to whatever shithole you came
from, you fuckin' tourist."

45:41.255 --> 45:42.589
But I was born here.

45:42.591 --> 45:44.624
I'm from here.

45:44.626 --> 45:46.759
Maybe the hipster
girl's right.

45:46.761 --> 45:50.095
Maybe we should
go somewhere else.

45:50.097 --> 45:50.932
Get away.

45:53.568 --> 45:54.401
Maybe.

46:25.499 --> 46:27.301
Hey, have you
seen my blue velvet?

46:28.637 --> 46:29.470
Bar?

46:30.605 --> 46:32.137
What?

46:32.139 --> 46:34.141
My blue
velvet, have you seen it?

46:35.175 --> 46:36.310
No, uh, I don't know.

47:01.570 --> 47:03.002
All right, let's
get out of here.

47:03.004 --> 47:04.003
You wanna take this?

47:04.005 --> 47:06.505
No, nah, go ahead and grab it.

47:06.507 --> 47:07.474
I'll paint over it.

47:24.960 --> 47:26.224
What if there's
somebody out there,

47:26.226 --> 47:28.395
and we don't even know it?

47:30.765 --> 47:32.199
Where would they be?

47:34.268 --> 47:35.336
I don't know.

47:36.403 --> 47:37.739
Where would
we even start looking?

47:41.375 --> 47:42.611
I don't know.

47:48.282 --> 47:49.216
Racist people.

47:52.020 --> 47:52.854
Children.

47:54.889 --> 47:55.890
Stockbrokers.

47:57.458 --> 47:59.391
Bill Gates.

47:59.393 --> 48:00.561
And Mel Gibson.

48:05.399 --> 48:07.201
All of North Korea.

48:11.238 --> 48:13.975
Every artist
you've ever known.

48:20.414 --> 48:24.986
And every actor,
and every director,

48:26.220 --> 48:27.419
and every scientist,

48:27.421 --> 48:29.758
and politician,
and schoolteacher.

48:35.229 --> 48:37.431
All the shitty ones,
and all the good ones.

50:06.720 --> 50:09.858
Man, being an astronomer's kind
of a bullshit job, isn't it?

50:12.693 --> 50:15.562
Like, all they do
is look at stuff,

50:17.031 --> 50:18.933
and then write
down what they saw.

50:20.835 --> 50:25.672
Like, oh look, that star
just exploded, write it down.

50:29.710 --> 50:33.547
I mean, sometimes,
that's all you have to do.

50:35.716 --> 50:39.788
You observe, and then interpret.

51:20.228 --> 51:22.263
Well, I guess that
was inevitable.

52:15.482 --> 52:16.317
Phyl?

52:18.052 --> 52:18.953
Come inside.

52:19.820 --> 52:24.825
Okay.

52:25.659 --> 52:26.858
What are we doin' in a tent?

52:26.860 --> 52:29.628
Actually, it's an
ancient Inuit structure,

52:29.630 --> 52:32.697
designed to keep us warm and
safe from the outside elements

52:32.699 --> 52:34.399
of the arctic tundra.

52:34.401 --> 52:38.137
I know, it's made of ice, so
you'd think it'd be freezing,

52:38.139 --> 52:40.174
but actually it
keeps the warmth in.

52:41.075 --> 52:42.174
I feel it.

52:42.176 --> 52:43.044
Oh, wait for it.

52:44.979 --> 52:46.747
I found this little guy outside.

52:48.882 --> 52:50.548
How d'you think he got here?

52:50.550 --> 52:54.853
Oh, probably just went
for a walk, got lost,

52:54.855 --> 52:57.089
wandered around for a bit,
and next thing he knew,

52:57.091 --> 52:58.026
he was in the cold.

52:59.027 --> 52:59.860
Poor little guy.

53:36.397 --> 53:37.562
What
are we doing here?

53:37.564 --> 53:39.798
Escaping
the elements.

53:39.800 --> 53:41.800
We can't
stay in here forever.

53:41.802 --> 53:43.102
Why not?

53:43.104 --> 53:43.937
We just can't.

53:45.906 --> 53:46.740
We'll die.

53:48.042 --> 53:49.210
I gotta get outta here.

54:02.756 --> 54:04.158
Please don't die before me.

54:06.094 --> 54:07.161
We could die together.

54:10.897 --> 54:12.300
Wanna make a suicide pact?

54:16.603 --> 54:20.441
If you died, I would
die of a broken heart.

54:22.143 --> 54:25.144
We'd be like, wrapped
in each others' arms,

54:25.146 --> 54:26.513
like the statues at Pompeii.

54:27.781 --> 54:29.148
I don't think there
were any like that.

54:29.150 --> 54:30.318
Of course there were.

54:32.953 --> 54:35.154
They did find a
guy masturbating.

54:37.958 --> 54:39.258
It happened.

54:39.260 --> 54:41.360
Okay, but you don't
have to talk about it

54:41.362 --> 54:42.763
when we're having a moment.

54:43.697 --> 54:46.499
Well what do you want from me?

54:46.501 --> 54:48.334
What's your problem?

54:48.336 --> 54:49.667
Nothing.

54:49.669 --> 54:50.835
I'm just not
excited about death.

54:50.837 --> 54:52.473
I didn't say that you were.

54:54.875 --> 54:56.044
Just fantasizing.

54:57.178 --> 54:59.111
Well death isn't
somethin' to joke about.

54:59.113 --> 55:00.114
I'm not joking.

55:01.215 --> 55:02.682
When did you get so morbid?

55:04.152 --> 55:05.552
I'm not morbid.

55:12.527 --> 55:15.229
It's like you don't even
wonder what this is all about.

55:16.563 --> 55:21.469
You sit around and turn
this over and over and over,

55:22.170 --> 55:25.337
trying to figure it out.

55:25.339 --> 55:29.874
But the truth is, that
we're never gonna know.

55:29.876 --> 55:33.747
So just snap out of it.

55:37.651 --> 55:39.120
I'm not like you, Phyl.

55:42.490 --> 55:43.857
I can't just turn on a dime.

55:47.528 --> 55:51.698
I can't help but feel the
burden that I was left behind.

55:55.735 --> 55:57.271
Those thoughts are insidious.

56:14.721 --> 56:16.957
I'm surrounded by so much stuff.

56:18.559 --> 56:20.792
But for some reason, it feels
like I'm standing in a room

56:20.794 --> 56:24.198
full of nothing, all the time.

56:28.101 --> 56:29.237
I'm there, too.

56:34.375 --> 56:38.246
Hey, hey!

56:40.481 --> 56:42.216
All I ever wanted
was to be happy.

56:44.651 --> 56:47.453
I thought that's
what you wanted, too.

56:47.455 --> 56:49.455
- I do, but...
- No buts.

56:49.457 --> 56:50.922
- Yeah, but...
- Barry!

56:50.924 --> 56:53.592
It's like you don't remember
what a shithole it was.

56:53.594 --> 56:54.493
I remember.

56:54.495 --> 56:56.127
Well, do you wanna go back

56:56.129 --> 56:57.797
to all that shit
that we endured?

56:58.965 --> 57:02.068
Back to that place
that didn't want us?

57:05.906 --> 57:07.439
Fuck it all.

57:07.441 --> 57:08.509
That's why we're here.

57:11.579 --> 57:16.584
Fuck the electricity, and
the cars, and buildings.

57:18.752 --> 57:19.953
We don't need any of it.

57:22.256 --> 57:23.422
We don't need the critics,

57:23.424 --> 57:25.293
and we don't need
the shitty directors.

57:27.794 --> 57:28.629
Fuck it all.

57:31.632 --> 57:32.799
Fuck it all.

57:34.602 --> 57:35.436
Come on.

57:57.625 --> 57:59.159
Did we go the wrong way?

58:02.862 --> 58:03.830
I don't think so.

58:06.701 --> 58:09.736
But, shouldn't we be
closer to the house by now?

58:20.847 --> 58:24.015
I guess, I guess
let's just keep goin'.

58:54.114 --> 58:56.016
Maybe we
took a wrong turn.

59:00.421 --> 59:01.422
Should we go back?

59:03.256 --> 59:05.359
I don't honestly
know which way is back.

59:10.964 --> 59:15.969
The highway runs north to
south, so if we go east or west,

59:17.203 --> 59:18.539
we'll run into it
eventually, right?

59:20.073 --> 59:21.709
Yeah,
that makes sense.

59:23.544 --> 59:26.277
Fuck, I shoulda
been in the scouts.

59:34.154 --> 59:35.721
All right, which
way is east or west?

59:35.723 --> 59:37.255
This way.

59:37.257 --> 59:38.058
Or this way.

59:39.460 --> 59:40.559
Let's go this way.

59:40.561 --> 59:42.663
Scouts, my ass.

1:00:00.348 --> 1:00:01.649
Holy shit.

1:00:04.452 --> 1:00:05.453
What should we do?

1:00:15.663 --> 1:00:16.497
Look.

1:00:22.035 --> 1:00:24.035
Lets get some rest.

1:00:24.037 --> 1:00:27.338
In the morning, I'll go up
to that ridge, right there.

1:00:27.340 --> 1:00:30.711
When the sun's out, I'll
see if I can see, something.

1:00:33.980 --> 1:00:34.815
Okay.

1:00:37.785 --> 1:00:38.652
Oh, oh God.

1:00:50.964 --> 1:00:52.800
I'd say something
reassuring, like,

1:00:54.200 --> 1:00:55.870
I'm sure somebody's
looking for us.

1:00:59.239 --> 1:01:00.240
I know it's not true.

1:01:14.655 --> 1:01:17.390
We've got the
moon on our side.

1:01:23.497 --> 1:01:25.599
We got that goin' for us.

1:01:38.011 --> 1:01:40.013
Startin' to feel
like a punishment.

1:02:46.246 --> 1:02:47.080
Fuck.

1:03:10.036 --> 1:03:11.639
Startin' to think it's all gone.

1:03:21.047 --> 1:03:25.184
I don't, I don't
wanna be here anymore.

1:03:37.731 --> 1:03:39.132
And I want ice cream.

1:03:47.641 --> 1:03:48.539
I'm sorry.

1:03:48.541 --> 1:03:50.376
Don't apologize.

1:04:01.589 --> 1:04:02.656
Just let me think.

1:04:14.500 --> 1:04:15.335
Okay.

1:04:18.404 --> 1:04:20.906
Do you
remember when we first met?

1:04:20.908 --> 1:04:22.273
At the bookstore?

1:04:34.220 --> 1:04:36.120
That, wasn't me.

1:04:36.122 --> 1:04:37.223
Oh.

1:04:46.265 --> 1:04:47.598
Ah, 'scuse me?

1:04:47.600 --> 1:04:48.434
What?

1:04:49.803 --> 1:04:51.404
Um, I'm looking for David.

1:04:57.410 --> 1:04:59.111
I'm the new set designer.

1:04:59.113 --> 1:05:01.780
Oh, okay.

1:05:01.782 --> 1:05:02.781
God, right.

1:05:08.621 --> 1:05:09.455
I'm an idiot.

1:05:19.967 --> 1:05:21.001
My idiot.

1:05:36.083 --> 1:05:39.652
- I miss that.
- Me too.

1:05:46.160 --> 1:05:47.795
I liked when you'd
watch me work.

1:05:57.603 --> 1:05:59.338
I don't like what we've become.

1:06:37.878 --> 1:06:39.512
Phyl, Phyl, Phyl!

1:06:43.917 --> 1:06:45.518
We never asked for it back.

1:06:52.492 --> 1:06:54.660
We never just asked for it back.

1:06:55.863 --> 1:06:56.696
No.

1:06:57.730 --> 1:06:59.699
We just need it reversed.

1:07:04.570 --> 1:07:06.370
What?

1:07:06.372 --> 1:07:08.708
We need to ask the
universe to reverse it.

1:07:09.709 --> 1:07:11.044
Back the way it was.

1:07:26.960 --> 1:07:29.096
I don't even
remember what I said.

1:07:33.066 --> 1:07:36.402
We asked the cosmic
universe for privacy.

1:07:38.771 --> 1:07:40.107
So un-ask for it.

1:07:45.045 --> 1:07:50.050
Oh, cosmic universe, um,

1:07:52.318 --> 1:07:54.888
undo what has been done,

1:07:57.557 --> 1:08:02.461
and return the people
of Earth to Earth.

1:08:08.101 --> 1:08:11.669
I'm sorry for what I asked for,

1:08:11.671 --> 1:08:15.075
and, and, um, and
I didn't mean it.

1:08:25.185 --> 1:08:26.819
I think we just
wait til morning.

1:09:09.129 --> 1:09:10.628
What are you doing?

1:09:10.630 --> 1:09:12.498
I'm building a house.

1:09:15.401 --> 1:09:17.035
Why?

1:09:17.037 --> 1:09:18.671
I liked our house.

1:09:19.705 --> 1:09:21.206
We need to rebuild again.

1:09:21.208 --> 1:09:25.045
I'm sick and tired of
wandering around the woods.

1:09:26.914 --> 1:09:28.081
We should keep going.

1:09:28.982 --> 1:09:30.248
And go where?

1:09:30.250 --> 1:09:32.683
East, like you said.

1:09:32.685 --> 1:09:33.817
And do what?

1:09:33.819 --> 1:09:37.322
We might, find something.

1:09:37.324 --> 1:09:39.090
I know exactly what
we're gonna find.

1:09:39.092 --> 1:09:41.159
Over there, is more trees.

1:09:41.161 --> 1:09:43.460
And guess what, over
there, more trees.

1:09:43.462 --> 1:09:44.595
Will you stop
acting like that?

1:09:44.597 --> 1:09:46.398
How am I supposed to act

1:09:46.400 --> 1:09:49.869
when I'm lost in
the fucking woods?

1:09:51.271 --> 1:09:55.173
I'm annoyed, and I'm tired
of being surrounded by trees.

1:09:55.175 --> 1:09:57.175
You're yelling at a tree.

1:09:57.177 --> 1:09:58.911
I don't like trees.

1:09:59.779 --> 1:10:01.246
You want the trees to be gone?

1:10:01.248 --> 1:10:02.746
Yes.

1:10:02.748 --> 1:10:05.516
Okay, well kicking them
isn't gonna get rid of them.

1:10:05.518 --> 1:10:07.287
You're kicking a tree.

1:10:12.960 --> 1:10:14.294
We should just keep moving.

1:10:16.896 --> 1:10:18.365
We can go anywhere we want.

1:10:20.733 --> 1:10:25.738
You wanna go to the ocean, watch
the sun rise over the Gulf?

1:10:26.406 --> 1:10:27.205
Let's go!

1:10:27.207 --> 1:10:28.641
We can go anywhere.

1:10:31.610 --> 1:10:35.614
But we're not gonna get there
with you acting like a baby.

1:10:37.616 --> 1:10:39.150
I don't like being lost.

1:10:39.152 --> 1:10:42.055
Well then, let's
get out of the woods!

1:10:56.103 --> 1:11:00.606
If I leave, I'm not sure
I'll find my way back to you.

1:11:04.577 --> 1:11:06.411
There's a better chance
of us finding something

1:11:06.413 --> 1:11:07.913
if we're looking together.

1:11:09.016 --> 1:11:09.849
No.

1:11:11.318 --> 1:11:14.087
Every time we go anywhere, the
world as we know it changes.

1:11:16.189 --> 1:11:18.425
We should just be happy
with what we've got.

1:11:21.328 --> 1:11:22.329
I'm staying right here.

1:11:27.034 --> 1:11:28.268
Is that what you want?

1:11:30.803 --> 1:11:32.004
I wanna build a house.

1:11:34.474 --> 1:11:35.975
A place for us to be us again.

1:11:48.455 --> 1:11:50.057
We don't need
a house for that.

1:13:19.945 --> 1:13:23.316
You've got to be
fucking kidding me!

1:13:30.490 --> 1:13:31.324
What the?

1:13:34.561 --> 1:13:36.429
Nice, isn't it?

1:13:39.166 --> 1:13:43.236
You said you hated the trees,
wanted to be in the sand.

1:13:44.136 --> 1:13:44.970
Yeah.

1:13:46.105 --> 1:13:50.809
In the, Hawaii, or
Greece, or something.

1:13:54.079 --> 1:13:56.982
Not in the middle of
the fucking desert!

1:14:10.930 --> 1:14:12.599
You coulda done anything to us.

1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:18.101
You coulda turned me
into a little cockroach.

1:14:18.103 --> 1:14:21.707
Or one of those little rats
that just shits everywhere.

1:14:24.109 --> 1:14:26.346
You coulda done anything!

1:14:28.781 --> 1:14:29.683
And you do this?

1:14:32.285 --> 1:14:36.654
You put us in a place that's
incapable of sustaining life?

1:14:36.656 --> 1:14:39.156
Barry, who are you talking to?

1:14:39.158 --> 1:14:42.161
Whatever god is up there.

1:14:43.796 --> 1:14:44.797
Toying with us.

1:14:47.500 --> 1:14:48.335
You know?

1:14:49.636 --> 1:14:53.504
Just playin' with us, like
we're in a little ant farm.

1:14:53.506 --> 1:14:54.905
He's got a magnifying glass,

1:14:54.907 --> 1:14:57.076
he's burnin' away
everything we love.

1:15:02.682 --> 1:15:03.650
But guess what.

1:15:05.685 --> 1:15:06.519
Guess.

1:15:07.520 --> 1:15:08.885
I don't even, honestly
know what it is...

1:15:08.887 --> 1:15:12.690
I can kick whatever
I want to kick!

1:15:22.768 --> 1:15:23.668
What?

1:15:23.670 --> 1:15:24.504
You're laughing.

1:15:27.607 --> 1:15:28.441
Yeah.

1:15:32.279 --> 1:15:35.848
I can't remember the
last time that you laughed.

1:15:37.717 --> 1:15:42.289
Huh, well, I
think I finally get it.

1:15:47.427 --> 1:15:48.595
What do you get?

1:15:50.730 --> 1:15:51.631
All this.

1:16:01.073 --> 1:16:03.443
No matter how far we
get from the world,

1:16:08.481 --> 1:16:10.983
it's always gonna be a
pretty shitty place for us.

1:16:15.655 --> 1:16:18.090
There's always gonna
be some greater power,

1:16:20.292 --> 1:16:22.161
that's pushin' down
on our happiness.

1:16:24.597 --> 1:16:29.602
Some Zeus, bringin' in a
flood, takin' everything away.

1:16:34.774 --> 1:16:35.775
'Til we got nothin'.

1:16:43.982 --> 1:16:48.987
Nothin' except someone
who understands all of that.

1:16:57.364 --> 1:16:58.197
Yeah.

1:17:07.005 --> 1:17:08.375
Wanna build a sand castle?

1:17:17.049 --> 1:17:17.950
This is nice.

1:17:19.017 --> 1:17:20.018
Isn't it, though?

1:17:21.120 --> 1:17:23.288
The waves, the breeze.

1:17:25.324 --> 1:17:27.359
The sun, sand.

1:17:29.361 --> 1:17:31.194
You know what, screw the sun.

1:17:31.196 --> 1:17:32.497
We don't need it.

1:17:32.499 --> 1:17:33.997
Screw the stars, screw the moon,

1:17:33.999 --> 1:17:35.800
screw everything
in the universe.

1:17:35.802 --> 1:17:37.802
You really wanna try
your luck with that one?

1:17:37.804 --> 1:17:39.506
Oh, I made you something.

1:17:40.740 --> 1:17:42.040
- For me?
- Yeah!

1:18:09.935 --> 1:18:11.538
And you got your vacation.

1:18:19.211 --> 1:18:20.447
And I got us here.

1:18:23.115 --> 1:18:24.049
What did you say?

1:18:26.351 --> 1:18:30.289
You got your
vacation, and I got you.

1:18:31.691 --> 1:18:34.391
What?

1:18:34.393 --> 1:18:37.029
You said you wanted to be
away from all the people,

1:18:38.063 --> 1:18:39.799
now we're away from
all the people.

1:18:47.439 --> 1:18:48.273
Right.

1:18:51.778 --> 1:18:53.078
I wanted a vacation.

1:18:59.552 --> 1:19:01.888
Rid the planet
of all the people.

1:19:09.929 --> 1:19:12.095
Let's get out of the woods.

1:19:12.097 --> 1:19:13.900
We don't need
a house for that.

1:19:20.105 --> 1:19:21.137
You wanna go back to all that?

1:19:21.139 --> 1:19:22.974
To that shit that we endured?

1:19:22.976 --> 1:19:26.243
We don't need any of it,
that's why we're here.

1:19:26.245 --> 1:19:29.682
Fuck the electricity, fuck
the buildings, fuck it all.

1:19:48.001 --> 1:19:48.835
It's you.

1:19:52.005 --> 1:19:53.538
What?

1:19:53.540 --> 1:19:55.140
It's been you this whole time.

1:19:59.344 --> 1:20:01.146
What are you talking about?

1:20:02.347 --> 1:20:04.283
Whatever you've
wanted, you've gotten.

1:20:06.786 --> 1:20:08.786
That's ridiculous.

1:20:08.788 --> 1:20:13.024
No, no, there's no
greater force at work here.

1:20:13.026 --> 1:20:14.493
It's just you!

1:20:17.162 --> 1:20:19.531
I don't understand
what's happening right now.

1:20:21.901 --> 1:20:24.037
You did this.

1:20:26.039 --> 1:20:26.873
Did what?

1:20:28.575 --> 1:20:30.173
All of this!

1:20:30.175 --> 1:20:33.044
Everything you want, you get.

1:20:33.046 --> 1:20:34.144
No, that's not true.

1:20:34.146 --> 1:20:35.378
- Yes it is.
- Barry.

1:20:35.380 --> 1:20:36.814
Yes it is!

1:20:36.816 --> 1:20:40.485
There's no greater force pushing
down on me, it's just you!

1:20:42.087 --> 1:20:44.922
All I've ever
done is support you!

1:20:44.924 --> 1:20:45.990
- No!
- Yeah.

1:20:45.992 --> 1:20:47.190
- No.
- Yes I have!

1:20:47.192 --> 1:20:48.093
You're selfish!

1:20:49.862 --> 1:20:50.930
You're selfish.

1:20:57.202 --> 1:20:58.705
What's gotten into you?

1:21:01.106 --> 1:21:04.209
You say that you just
want to be with me.

1:21:06.012 --> 1:21:08.012
You just wanna
make yourself happy.

1:21:08.014 --> 1:21:10.047
You don't care
about anything else.

1:21:10.049 --> 1:21:10.915
No, that's not

1:21:10.917 --> 1:21:12.049
- true at all.
- Yes it is.

1:21:12.051 --> 1:21:13.618
- Why would you think that?
- Yes it is.

1:21:13.620 --> 1:21:14.584
You wanted this.

1:21:14.586 --> 1:21:15.920
You wanted this.

1:21:15.922 --> 1:21:18.288
All I ever wanted
was to be with you.

1:21:18.290 --> 1:21:19.924
- That's not true!
- Yes it is, Barry stop.

1:21:19.926 --> 1:21:22.026
- Don't come near me!
- Barry, stop, please.

1:21:22.028 --> 1:21:23.393
I don't wanna see you again!

1:21:23.395 --> 1:21:25.898
Please, could you just stop?

1:21:37.309 --> 1:21:39.275
No, no no no no.

1:21:39.277 --> 1:21:40.947
Barry, no no, Barry?

1:21:42.815 --> 1:21:45.417
Barry, Barry Barry Barry Barry.

1:21:46.986 --> 1:21:48.653
Oh my God, oh my God!

1:21:51.090 --> 1:21:52.557
I don't want this.

1:21:53.793 --> 1:21:55.993
I don't want this, I
don't want anything

1:21:55.995 --> 1:21:57.130
if I don't have you.

1:22:00.599 --> 1:22:01.932
No.

1:22:16.849 --> 1:22:17.684
Barry?

1:22:21.087 --> 1:22:22.021
Where are you?

1:22:23.455 --> 1:22:25.022
I can't see you.

1:22:25.024 --> 1:22:25.925
Barry!

1:22:29.594 --> 1:22:30.697
Please come back to me!

1:22:35.333 --> 1:22:36.169
Please!
