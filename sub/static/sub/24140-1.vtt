14:09.039 --> 14:11.806
Ethan,

14:11.808 --> 14:15.212

In the city.

14:39.703 --> 14:42.072
With my boyfriend.

14:44.308 --> 14:47.075
Does he take care of you?

14:47.077 --> 14:48.379
Actually, I work.

Besides, we broke up.

15:01.758 --> 15:03.357
I thought
you said "boyfriend."

15:03.359 --> 15:08.498
Was. It's recent. So, I'm
just not used to saying "ex."

15:09.766 --> 15:11.301
Why'd you break up?

15:13.703 --> 15:17.171
Because I caught him
fucking someone else.

15:17.173 --> 15:20.107
- So?
- So, he was mine.

15:20.109 --> 15:23.577

I don't know what to
believe with you anymore.

15:40.497 --> 15:43.532
Why would I lie about
something like that?

15:43.534 --> 15:48.068
People lie by saying they are
happy when they're not,

15:48.070 --> 15:51.038

My special pen.

24:25.488 --> 24:26.987
Why is it special?

24:26.989 --> 24:28.556
Because I use
it to draw.

24:28.558 --> 24:29.856
What's it look like?

24:29.858 --> 24:33.193

in the same place.

I'm positive.

Sometimes, things
are in plain sight,

else to look for you.

ALICE: Ethan.

48:58.093 --> 49:02.627
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

49:02.629 --> 49:06.501
- I thought you left.
- No.

49:09.336 --> 49:12.571
Did you open
the windows last night?

49:12.573 --> 49:16.508
No, why?

49:16.510 --> 49:20.078
I thought
they were open.

49:20.080 --> 49:23.415
Maybe you opened them.

49:23.417 --> 49:25.453
Maybe.

49:29.923 --> 49:32.793
What are you
doing in here?

49:34.196 --> 49:38.667
Making coffee.
You want some?

49:41.035 --> 49:43.070
Yeah.

49:57.484 --> 49:59.086
What are you
thinking about?

50:00.421 --> 50:01.555
Hmm?

50:04.559 --> 50:08.560
Creatures grow
inside our bellies.

50:08.562 --> 50:14.633
It's like we're technically upside
down, and yet, we don't fall.

50:14.635 --> 50:17.937
But people think it's strange
to consider somewhere else...

50:17.939 --> 50:19.574
Wait. Where'd
you get that?

50:24.778 --> 50:27.946
I found it.

50:27.948 --> 50:29.984
You shouldn't wear that.

50:34.890 --> 50:37.759
You'd never
leave me behind, right?

50:44.365 --> 50:47.335
Just promise you'll never leave me.
Please.

50:52.106 --> 50:54.609
I won't leave you.

50:57.044 --> 51:01.015
Just don't fuck me over
like you did to her.

51:04.318 --> 51:05.786
She deserved it.

51:07.287 --> 51:10.324
You're the reason
why she left, Alice.

51:20.669 --> 51:24.435
Alice! Alice, wait!

51:24.437 --> 51:25.973
Alice, stop!

Hi.

- Nothing.
- Nothing.

This is Alice.

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

51:53.434 --> 51:57.770
Alice. Alice.
Of course. I'm so sorry.

51:57.772 --> 51:59.741
Hi.

52:05.046 --> 52:08.216
I'm Misty,
Ethan's girlfriend.

52:11.553 --> 52:14.319
- Misty.
- Yeah.

52:14.321 --> 52:16.254
Did you forget
I was coming?

52:16.256 --> 52:18.691
Yeah. No. I mean,
I forgot. I'm...

52:18.693 --> 52:21.361
No. I got caught up
in things. Sorry.

52:21.363 --> 52:25.163
Right. Obviously.
I missed you.

52:25.165 --> 52:28.334
I missed you, too.

I feel crazy after that trip.

52:36.410 --> 52:38.479
It was really
great to meet you.

52:46.019 --> 52:48.220
I can't believe you didn't
tell me you had a girlfriend.

52:48.222 --> 52:51.258
- You won't say anything...
- About what?

52:54.361 --> 52:57.562
- About what's been happening.
- What has been happening?

52:57.564 --> 53:00.098
- Just things have been weird.
- So, you will admit it.

53:00.100 --> 53:03.102
Just... Just don't
tell her about it.

53:03.104 --> 53:05.705
I can't believe you
didn't tell me about her.

53:05.707 --> 53:07.707
I'm sorry.

53:07.709 --> 53:10.946
No, I mean, I can't believe it.
It's literally unbelievable.

Very strange.

53:45.979 --> 53:47.812
For what?

53:47.814 --> 53:51.216
I didn't know she was coming.
She just showed up.

53:51.218 --> 53:52.950
It's okay.

53:52.952 --> 53:56.788
I mean, it was a bit of
a shock, but it's okay.

53:56.790 --> 53:59.825
She's just staying for
one more night, I think.

53:59.827 --> 54:04.062
- You think?
- I'll ask her to leave tomorrow.

54:04.064 --> 54:06.399
No, I didn't mean
she should leave.

54:06.401 --> 54:10.839
It's just, I was looking forward
to spending more time with you.

(GRUNTS)

There you are.
What are you doing?

55:26.414 --> 55:29.046
Are you sure
she's your girlfriend?

55:29.048 --> 55:30.750
No, I'm not sure.

55:30.752 --> 55:32.685
Yes, Alice. What the fuck?
What are you talking about?

55:32.687 --> 55:35.120
I've seen her before.

55:35.122 --> 55:36.957
Probably saw a picture
around the house.

55:37.725 --> 55:40.828
Yes, in the picture.

55:42.564 --> 55:43.732
ETHAN: Where'd you find that?

55:45.200 --> 55:50.368
In the closet, with the dress.

55:50.370 --> 55:51.669
I thought it was her.

55:51.671 --> 55:53.907
- Misty?
- Never mind.

55:55.276 --> 55:56.408
It doesn't matter.

55:56.410 --> 55:57.712
What?

56:02.783 --> 56:04.082
Guess I'm gonna
leave, then.

56:04.084 --> 56:05.950
Why?

56:05.952 --> 56:07.252
- I don't want to get in the way.
- You're not getting in the way.

56:07.254 --> 56:09.590
No, it's fine. Really.
I'm gonna leave.

I mean, I'm not sure where I'm
gonna go, but I'll figure it out.

56:18.198 --> 56:22.468
Why don't you stay one more
night? Just one more night.

56:22.470 --> 56:25.236
I've already told
her all about you.

56:25.238 --> 56:29.841
We'll get to know
one another.

56:29.843 --> 56:31.278
Why didn't you
tell me about her?

56:32.078 --> 56:33.412
Didn't I?

56:33.414 --> 56:35.580
- Don't try and make me feel crazy.
- I'm not.

56:35.582 --> 56:37.482
Yes, you are. You didn't
tell me about her.

56:37.484 --> 56:39.118
Why?

56:39.120 --> 56:40.852
- I don't know. I don't trust you.
- Trust me to what?

56:40.854 --> 56:42.354
'Cause you'd do
something weird.

56:42.356 --> 56:44.059
You'd make fun of her,
you'd be mean to her.

56:46.160 --> 56:48.127
Where'd you say you met?

56:48.129 --> 56:51.162
- Nearby. She was up here on a film.
- Mmm.

56:51.164 --> 56:54.935
- Didn't I tell you that?
- Stop saying that! You didn't tell me.

56:58.472 --> 57:00.272
Is she an actress?

57:00.274 --> 57:03.508
Yes. She was up
here on a film.

57:03.510 --> 57:05.310
- Where?
- Los Angeles.

57:05.312 --> 57:06.611
You just said
here, Ethan.

57:06.613 --> 57:09.281
No, I meant that...

57:09.283 --> 57:12.450
We met here, but she just
got back from Los Angeles.

57:12.452 --> 57:13.819
- Hollywood?
- I don't know.

- It's the same thing, isn't it?
- Sort of.

is Misty, anyway?

57:20.028 --> 57:22.127
I don't know.

Does she just mist about
from room to room,

57:25.033 --> 57:26.665

- What's up with you?
- How long have you been dating?

57:29.169 --> 57:31.671
I don't know.
A few months.

57:31.673 --> 57:33.839
You sure seem confused
about your relationship.

on my strength.

a few more nights?

57:55.495 --> 57:58.730
Yeah, I already
said that.

57:58.732 --> 58:01.734
I thought she picked me.
I'm very confused.

- What are you talking about?
- Okay, fine.

58:04.405 --> 58:05.906

Okay.

or so, though.

break up the lettuce?

when Mount St. Helens erupted

back in 1980.

last night?

set the table?

outside, yeah?

- Alice.
- What?

Come on.

- No one, really.
- No one?

No, I wasn't really
the boyfriend type.

And then, I met Ethan.

your own place?

01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:54.165
No, I travel a lot for work,
so, I just stay here.

What about your stuff? Where
do you keep all your stuff?

01:01:57.336 --> 01:01:59.971
I don't really
have a lot of stuff.

01:01:59.973 --> 01:02:02.477
Can we just have a normal
fucking conversation, please?

01:02:05.278 --> 01:02:08.615
Did Ethan tell you
about what's happening?

No.

what I'm talking about?

You're the same as me.

We need to stick together.

That's why
I'm back now, okay?

01:02:51.290 --> 01:02:54.660
She was awful to me, Misty.

01:02:54.662 --> 01:02:57.562
- Truly awful to me.
- Who?

01:02:57.564 --> 01:02:58.899
Mother.

01:03:02.068 --> 01:03:03.502
That's why I ran away.

01:03:03.504 --> 01:03:04.669
No, you ran away
because you...

01:03:04.671 --> 01:03:06.370
- Because what?
- Nothing.

01:03:06.372 --> 01:03:09.640
- What?
- Nothing.

01:03:09.642 --> 01:03:14.848
After I fucked her husband, she
just walked into the ocean.

Just walked and kept walking until...

There's no proof.
They never found her body.

01:03:35.301 --> 01:03:39.073
She had a secret life.

we just talked about,

01:04:55.348 --> 01:04:59.517
she's gonna sit
by the fucking pool.

01:04:59.519 --> 01:05:02.287
She has no stuff. She
grew up here and there.

01:05:02.289 --> 01:05:06.024
- She has no past.
- She told us her past.

01:05:06.026 --> 01:05:07.591
Where'd you meet her?

01:05:07.593 --> 01:05:10.729
- I told you. Up here, on the movie.
- Really?

01:05:10.731 --> 01:05:12.631
Why is that so weird?

01:05:12.633 --> 01:05:14.665
She got into my head,
then yours.

01:05:14.667 --> 01:05:18.102
What? I don't...
What do you mean?

01:05:18.104 --> 01:05:19.970
She lives here,

01:05:19.972 --> 01:05:23.408
yet, I don't see, or feel the
energy of another woman.

01:05:23.410 --> 01:05:26.011
I don't know why not.

01:05:26.013 --> 01:05:29.747
I don't understand. You're
acting like she has an agenda.

01:05:29.749 --> 01:05:33.453
No. She's the one
acting, Ethan.

01:05:36.490 --> 01:05:41.225
She picked me.
Now, she wants you.

01:05:41.227 --> 01:05:44.696
What are you
talking about?

01:05:44.698 --> 01:05:47.397
It's not fair.

01:05:47.399 --> 01:05:50.035
She's gonna
take you away.

01:05:50.037 --> 01:05:54.406
I'm not going anywhere.

01:05:54.408 --> 01:05:57.944

I tore things apart.

01:06:00.714 --> 01:06:03.084
- Sorry.
- Alice.

01:06:04.718 --> 01:06:08.890
That's all in
the past. Okay?

01:06:12.459 --> 01:06:15.096
We can move forward.

01:07:41.414 --> 01:07:43.483
Looks great on you.

01:07:55.162 --> 01:07:58.232
Sorry about earlier.

01:07:59.865 --> 01:08:01.968
It's all right.

01:08:03.604 --> 01:08:06.473
You don't think I'm terrible?

Everybody makes mistakes.

01:08:16.350 --> 01:08:19.451
- What's Ethan's book about?
- I don't know.

01:08:19.453 --> 01:08:23.624
He's not going to show it
to me until it's finished.

01:08:27.794 --> 01:08:31.031
Are you in love, Misty?

01:08:31.832 --> 01:08:33.598
Yes.

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:35.500
Both of you?

01:08:35.502 --> 01:08:38.036
Well, I would assume.

01:08:38.037 --> 01:08:42.104
- That's funny.
- Why's that?

01:08:42.107 --> 01:08:46.376
I guess I didn't get
that vibe from him.

01:08:46.377 --> 01:08:49.179
Why? What did he say?

use the word, "love,"

just nervous to tell me.

01:26:28.673 --> 01:26:33.145
Ethan, she came here
because she knew.

01:26:38.184 --> 01:26:41.620
They took her

01:26:47.059 --> 01:26:51.594

go with her, huh?

01:26:51.596 --> 01:26:54.099

01:27:02.106 --> 01:27:03.909
Okay.
