WEBVTT

00:21.154 --> 00:24.890
My name's Kyle,
and I wanna be
a policeman.

00:29.329 --> 00:32.931
I'm Gordon.
I wanna be a lawyer.

00:37.303 --> 00:40.305
My name is Martha,
and I'm a t. Rex!

00:41.809 --> 00:43.642
Okay, Martha.

00:53.019 --> 00:55.387
No, I'm gonna delete that one.
Hey, what's up?

00:55.389 --> 00:58.657
"My girlfriend just sent me
the sexiest photo."

00:58.659 --> 01:03.195
Ew. Oh, that looks like a butt.
My boobs look like a butt?

01:03.197 --> 01:05.998
Just hanging' out
in your favorite shirt
and lingerie.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.434
Oh, boy.
None of these are good.

01:46.907 --> 01:49.641
Okay.

01:56.249 --> 02:00.152
I mean,
was I cheating on you?
Yes, maybe.

02:01.321 --> 02:03.589
I'm such an asshole, okay?
I know.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.824
Do you think that I like
being like this?

02:05.826 --> 02:09.627
I just need validation
all the time.
It's pathetic.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.664
But I think
that's something
you can work on.

02:13.967 --> 02:17.402
Yeah, this is super-fucked.

02:17.404 --> 02:20.205
But maybe...

02:21.141 --> 02:23.775
It's a new beginning,
right?

02:23.777 --> 02:25.611
Mmm.

02:25.613 --> 02:28.947
Oh, wow.

02:28.949 --> 02:31.316
I like your nail Polish.

02:31.318 --> 02:34.753
I'm just gonna grab
this little fella.

02:36.422 --> 02:39.258
This is what
I'm talking about, Martha.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.860
You got no sense
of adventure.

02:56.142 --> 02:57.843
Hey, watch it.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.711
Hey, have a nice day.

03:50.697 --> 03:53.365
Hi. Hey. Sharon?

03:53.367 --> 03:55.867
- Yeah.
- How are you?

03:55.869 --> 03:57.936
Is that Chanel?

03:57.938 --> 03:59.538
I like it.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.940
What, are you
with the hotel?
No, no.

04:01.942 --> 04:04.409
I'm actually supposed
to be in Milwaukee,
killing your husband

04:04.411 --> 04:06.745
before he can take
your half of the firm.

04:06.747 --> 04:10.382
That's what it's about.
They don't tell me much.
That's what I could figure out.

04:10.384 --> 04:13.018
I was really proud
of myself for that.
Gee whiz.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.286
Look, i--

04:14.288 --> 04:15.887
don't hurt my feelings,
Sharon.

04:15.889 --> 04:19.524
You contacted a fixer
to hire someone
to kill your husband.

04:20.526 --> 04:21.860
Huh?

04:21.862 --> 04:24.129
Okay.

04:24.131 --> 04:27.933
So if you're not there,
then why are you here?

04:27.935 --> 04:31.069
Murder's wrong, Sharon.

04:31.071 --> 04:32.738
But you're a hit man.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.273
Nobody's perfect.

04:40.813 --> 04:43.548
You're gonna come home
and look at me

04:43.550 --> 04:48.086
like I'm uptight 'cause
i don't want a threesome?

04:48.088 --> 04:50.589
You asshole!
'Cause I'm not so--
Martha?

04:50.591 --> 04:53.125
- It's Sophie. Are you okay?
- You don't even know me!

04:53.127 --> 04:54.660
She's not okay.

04:54.662 --> 04:56.895
No, because you didn't
bring the--

04:56.897 --> 04:59.731
why would you bring--
that doesn't even
make any sense.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.833
She's doing drunk closet.
She's regressed to college.

05:01.835 --> 05:05.570
We've gotta open the door.
I need you to keep your eyes
to the ground.

05:05.572 --> 05:08.840
Because she takes
direct eye contact
as a sign of aggression.

05:08.842 --> 05:11.243
We're coming in.
No! No!

05:11.245 --> 05:13.345
This is my whole zone!

05:13.347 --> 05:15.580
This is for me!

05:15.582 --> 05:18.183
You stop judging me, 'cause
these are my favorite socks!

05:18.185 --> 05:20.452
And I have only
been drinking for two days.

05:20.454 --> 05:24.489
- Martha, you look good.
- I feel assumptions from you.

05:24.491 --> 05:27.125
I feel judgment from you.
You don't know the situation.

05:27.127 --> 05:31.296
You don't know
what's in my heart
'cause you're racist!

05:31.298 --> 05:32.531
No.
Okay, whoa.

05:32.533 --> 05:35.801
And you smell weird!
I'm sorry. You don't.

05:35.803 --> 05:38.470
Julia, I'm gonna
need your help.
I am not touching her.

05:38.472 --> 05:42.040
- She seems sticky.
- Get physical with me,
i will get physical with you.

05:42.042 --> 05:44.009
Take my hands.
One, two, there we go.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.144
You unhand me, you brute!
Ha-ha.

05:46.146 --> 05:47.813
No, I don't wanna leave.
No!
Martha.

05:47.815 --> 05:50.482
- I need your hands.
- You can't stop me! No!

05:50.484 --> 05:53.251
One of you hussies
is getting fisted!

05:57.190 --> 05:59.191
Okay, he's headed
towards the elevator.

05:59.193 --> 06:00.659
Eta two minutes.

06:00.661 --> 06:02.160
Espinoza's team
is already in position.

06:02.162 --> 06:05.397
For the money this guy's worth,
I'm gonna do my thing big.

06:05.399 --> 06:08.700
- Don't let this joker start
doing that thing he does.
- Amen, brother.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.402
Fucking dance party
is canceled!

06:10.404 --> 06:12.371
Yeah!

06:16.876 --> 06:19.745
- Hey, hopper,
you coming or what?
- No.

06:19.747 --> 06:21.713
Nope, I made a mistake.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.883
I thought you guys
were professional.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.651
But that's okay.

06:26.653 --> 06:28.487
That's okay.

06:28.489 --> 06:31.022
Someone's gotta
return the Van
after he kills you all.

06:31.024 --> 06:34.192
Yeah, whatever, pussy.

06:34.194 --> 06:35.827
Break a leg.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.701
- Here we go then.
-  <i> Stopping elevator now.</i>

06:42.703 --> 06:45.437
That's a mistake.
<i>What the hell?</i>
<i>He's not in here.</i>

06:45.439 --> 06:48.607
Yes, he is.
<i>What the fuck?</i>
<i>How's he moving like that?</i>

06:48.609 --> 06:50.976
<i>Catch up!</i>
<i> He's right there!</i>
- No, he isn't.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.547
Wow. Pretty.

06:55.549 --> 06:57.682
Balloons. Wedding?
Nice job.

06:57.684 --> 07:00.185
Listen, there's been
a fire down the hall,

07:00.187 --> 07:01.586
so everyone's gonna
have to evacuate.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.388
<i>He's going in the ballroom!</i>

07:03.390 --> 07:05.290
Don't follow him
into an open space.

07:05.292 --> 07:06.958
Fire! Now!

07:06.960 --> 07:08.627
Fire!

07:28.949 --> 07:31.016
<i>I got him in my sight.</i>

07:47.000 --> 07:48.500
By the cake!

07:51.572 --> 07:53.972
Well, if he's by the cake,

07:53.974 --> 07:55.774
that means he's got a knife.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.512
Fuck me.

08:14.294 --> 08:17.429
Who shoots cake?

08:17.431 --> 08:20.966
<i>This would have been</i>
<i>such a nice wedding.</i>

08:20.968 --> 08:24.536
Well, that was fun... ish.

08:26.439 --> 08:29.007
I'm not a racist.
I know you're not
a racist.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.542
I'm not.
Heads up! Whoa!

08:30.544 --> 08:32.376
Are you feeling--
ow! What the fuck?

08:32.379 --> 08:35.614
What if that was a bullet?
I'm training you.
You're welcome.

08:35.616 --> 08:38.450
Guys, let's go out.
You know?

08:38.452 --> 08:40.719
Let's get out of here.
It's New Orleans.

08:40.721 --> 08:42.687
You know, like,
we're young and free.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.856
We should find
a block party.

08:44.858 --> 08:47.292
We could find one
with a contest or something.

08:47.294 --> 08:50.295
Like a contest
for our bodies.

08:50.297 --> 08:53.532
And we show, like,
our boobs or something.

08:53.534 --> 08:58.703
I don't know.
But I wanna do
something terrible.

08:58.705 --> 09:01.406
I wanna do something terrible.
Ah!

09:04.977 --> 09:06.511
Are you okay?

09:08.081 --> 09:10.482
Excuse me.
Hello, ladies.

09:10.484 --> 09:12.017
What's this?

09:12.019 --> 09:14.686
That was a piÃ±a colada,
but I drank it,

09:14.688 --> 09:18.223
so now it's an empty cup
for my friend Julia.

09:18.225 --> 09:21.426
Oh, my god.
Jesus Christ.

09:21.428 --> 09:25.096
Is he here?
I knew this was a good bar.

09:25.098 --> 09:28.366
I'm gonna go find him.
Ooh.

09:38.110 --> 09:41.046
Oh. Oh! Oh!

09:43.050 --> 09:44.849
Wait!

09:46.852 --> 09:50.956
What the hell?
I'm the fucking man
right now!

09:51.724 --> 09:53.858
Ow!

09:57.530 --> 09:59.631
Oh, my gosh.
She's texting.
Who is she texting?

09:59.633 --> 10:02.400
Who are you texting?
Nobody.

10:02.402 --> 10:05.737
Do you think
if I text him I'm pregnant,
it would change anything?

10:05.739 --> 10:08.573
Is there
a pregnant emoticon?
Like... "Pregnant."

10:08.575 --> 10:10.575
What if I text him
that I'm dying?

10:10.577 --> 10:12.577
What if I text him
that <i> he's</i> dying?

10:12.579 --> 10:15.246
Because I'm going
to murder you, you--

10:15.248 --> 10:18.249
okay, give me that.
I'm not watching you
repeat yourself.

10:18.251 --> 10:20.785
You're the little engine
that could that keeps
running off the tracks.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.954
I'm stopping this train.
No more.

10:24.223 --> 10:25.890
I'm sorry. I am.

10:25.892 --> 10:28.259
I'm sorry, Sophie.
You're so good to me.

10:28.261 --> 10:31.129
I don't know how
this keeps happening.
Do I just suck?

10:31.131 --> 10:34.899
No.
Am I just like suckball McGee
over here?

10:34.901 --> 10:38.069
No, you're not
suckball McGee.
Come here.

10:38.071 --> 10:41.006
You know what?
You're just a work
in progress, babe.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.741
Oh, Sophie.
Okay.

10:42.743 --> 10:45.110
Why don't you come to work
with me tomorrow?
Really?

10:45.112 --> 10:48.613
Yeah. You just chill.
We can pet the cats.

10:48.615 --> 10:51.149
Love the cats!
They love you.
Mew!

10:51.851 --> 10:53.685
Yeah.
I love you so much.

10:53.687 --> 10:55.820
I love you too.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.093
<i>in reference to target m4937,</i>

11:02.095 --> 11:05.296
<i> you have been assigned</i>
<i> a new identity.</i>

11:05.298 --> 11:09.100
<i>You are FBI agent Leonard Knox</i>
<i>from the Alabama field office.</i>

11:10.302 --> 11:13.271
<i>New Orleans pd</i>
<i>is at your disposal.</i>

11:13.273 --> 11:17.142
<i>Hopper, because of</i>
<i>your personal relationship</i>
<i>with the target,</i>

11:17.144 --> 11:20.211
<i> we remind you that failure</i>
<i> will not be tolerated.</i>

11:20.213 --> 11:23.081
<i>Eliminating the target</i>
<i>is now your top priority.</i>

11:29.822 --> 11:31.389
Knox?

11:31.391 --> 11:34.392
Agent Leonard Knox?
Uh-huh.

11:34.394 --> 11:37.662
And you are?
Detective Gus Patrick.

11:37.664 --> 11:39.497
Welcome to New Orleans.

11:39.499 --> 11:41.266
Nice to meet you.

11:47.339 --> 11:48.907
Is this supposed
to be relaxing?

11:48.909 --> 11:51.476
Normally, it is. You make
everything so crazy.
I don't--

11:51.478 --> 11:53.244
why are you wearing
cat ears?

11:53.246 --> 11:55.747
They sell them
behind the counter.
Those are for kids.

11:55.749 --> 11:57.882
Well, I feel beautiful.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.884
But you guys are okay,
aren't you?

11:59.886 --> 12:02.187
You're just the cutest.
No, that is Hannibal.

12:02.189 --> 12:04.189
He's a straight-up
killer.
This one?

12:04.191 --> 12:06.991
- Yeah, he'll fucking
scratch your face off.
- Are you crazy?

12:06.993 --> 12:08.860
Are you crazy?

12:08.862 --> 12:10.729
This is a metaphor.
No.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.897
- This cat is my soul.
- It's not a metaphor.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.866
- I need to confront this.
- Martha, no.

12:14.868 --> 12:17.869
- We're gonna be best buddies.
- I would not stand that close.

12:17.871 --> 12:20.171
- It's gonna be okay.
- What are you doing?

12:24.376 --> 12:28.513
So in the metaphor,
do you think I won or lost?

12:28.515 --> 12:30.582
God, it just exploded.

12:30.584 --> 12:33.952
I mean, it pissed
right in your face. Ew.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.055
Sorry. You really
took the brunt of it.

12:37.057 --> 12:40.558
I thought
you'd have better reflexes,
working with cats so long.

12:40.560 --> 12:44.195
Do you think that's
a defense mechanism?
That it pisses in your face?

12:44.197 --> 12:47.699
Is that like
an evolutionary sort of--

12:48.567 --> 12:51.903
I'm really sorry, Sophie.

12:51.905 --> 12:54.873
It wasn't a metaphor.
Yeah, I realize that now.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.274
Yeah.

12:58.210 --> 13:00.879
You should go home.

13:00.881 --> 13:03.381
Are you sure?
Yeah.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.350
Yeah, very sure.

13:06.585 --> 13:09.087
Okay.
I will see you at home.

13:54.367 --> 13:55.867
Phew.

13:55.869 --> 13:57.836
How'd you do that?

13:57.838 --> 14:00.638
This is a lot of condoms.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.541
Enough condoms here
to choke a goat.
What?

14:03.543 --> 14:05.310
I don't know
what I just said.

14:05.312 --> 14:08.046
Hey, you wanna
get out of here?
What?

14:08.048 --> 14:11.783
Is it creepy?
Sometimes I don't know
I'm being creepy.

14:11.785 --> 14:16.721
Do you wanna go on a date?
Do you wanna get out of here
and then go on a date?

14:16.723 --> 14:21.326
Based on what?
Based on nothing?

14:21.328 --> 14:23.394
Just go on a date?

14:23.396 --> 14:25.029
What else
are you doing today?

14:25.031 --> 14:27.398
Fighting the urge
to run away from you
right now.

14:27.400 --> 14:31.469
I'm actually on the run too.
From creepy guys like you?

14:31.471 --> 14:34.539
Oh, man.
These guys wish they were
as creepy as I am.

14:34.541 --> 14:37.075
International hit men.

14:38.010 --> 14:40.178
Ew. Gross, right?
Oof.

14:40.180 --> 14:43.548
Come on, it's 3:00 pm.
Let's go get some gumbo.
Alligator pancakes?

14:43.550 --> 14:48.853
What else you got to do today?
Other than get serial killed
by a cartoon character?

14:48.855 --> 14:50.421
Maybe a lot.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.560
Was that cartoon character
bothering you?

14:55.562 --> 14:57.095
'Cause I'll kick his ass.

14:57.097 --> 15:00.932
What happened
to your hand?
Oh, it was a cat.

15:00.934 --> 15:03.701
I don't own cats, actually.
I'm not like a cat lady.

15:03.703 --> 15:09.674
I mean, I love cats,
but it was a rogue cat.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.543
I think you're beautiful.

15:12.545 --> 15:15.380
I'm more fun
than a barrel of kittens.
Mm-hmm.

15:15.382 --> 15:16.848
In a good way.
Yeah.

15:16.850 --> 15:18.783
Let's ditch
this popsicle stand.

15:18.785 --> 15:22.887
Let's go for it.
Let's go on a date.
Let's go out, you and me.

15:22.889 --> 15:26.090
Explain to me in two words
why I should hang with you.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.959
Two words?

15:28.427 --> 15:29.460
Um--

15:32.197 --> 15:33.798
"or else."

15:36.869 --> 15:39.037
Wow, yeah. That's actually
really fucking creepy.

15:39.039 --> 15:40.571
That's really creepy,
right?
Yeah.

15:40.573 --> 15:42.907
Come on.
You gonna pay for those?

15:42.909 --> 15:45.310
Um, I did.
Didn't I pay
for these already?

15:45.312 --> 15:47.111
No.
Oh, I didn't.
I'm so sorry.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.480
So sorry.
Ha. You caught me.

15:50.082 --> 15:52.583
Hey, buddy. What?
Hmm?

15:52.585 --> 15:56.054
You can't just attack it
from the bottom Willy-nilly.

15:56.056 --> 16:01.125
You were doing fine before.
Just eat it like a-- you know,
like a normal human man.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.428
Are you--
what are you,
the hot dog police?

16:03.430 --> 16:04.929
Are you new to eating?

16:04.931 --> 16:07.098
I love that shirt.
Oh, really?

16:07.100 --> 16:10.068
Yeah, it's confident.
You've got, like,
a confidence thing.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.003
I have a confidence thing?

16:12.005 --> 16:14.605
Yeah.
Like, "fuck everybody."
You know what I mean?

16:14.607 --> 16:17.342
Excuse me. Ladies?
Don't you think she has
a confidence thing?

16:17.344 --> 16:19.744
Sorry.
He's a crazy person.
I don't know him.

16:19.746 --> 16:22.480
You do.
It's funny, though,
'cause this was an ordeal.

16:22.482 --> 16:26.284
Every time I get dressed,
i have to confront, like,
what does this say about me?

16:26.286 --> 16:29.854
'Cause I have stuff going on
in here and in here,

16:29.856 --> 16:32.457
and I need my shirt
to be a reflection of that.

16:32.459 --> 16:35.626
That's a lot
of responsibility
for a shirt.

16:35.628 --> 16:39.130
Yeah. Well, I probably
don't need to tackle
the meaning of life

16:39.132 --> 16:41.132
every time I make
a decision about clothes.

16:41.134 --> 16:43.468
I actually
relate to that.
Oh, yeah?

16:43.470 --> 16:47.138
Yeah. It takes me
half an hour every morning
just to decide what to wear.

16:47.140 --> 16:51.042
Oh, 'cause I thought
this was a terrible,
terrible accident.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.677
No, this was
a conscious decision.

16:52.679 --> 16:55.546
I'm completely
fucking bananas.

16:56.482 --> 16:58.683
You're funny.
Yeah.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.051
Eh--

17:05.190 --> 17:08.126
you didn't finish your story
about the museum dig things.

17:08.127 --> 17:10.828
Oh, yeah, well,
it never happened.

17:10.829 --> 17:14.898
I met Jeff,
and it was sort of about him
and his dreams and his goals.

17:14.901 --> 17:16.666
He's a professor, so--

17:16.669 --> 17:19.704
I guess
I'm supposed to be too,
if I honor my degree.

17:19.705 --> 17:22.040
How'd he die?
He's--

17:22.041 --> 17:25.476
no, he's alive.
He's fine.

17:25.478 --> 17:27.345
He's just an asshole.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.347
Well, I mean,
he wasn't at first,

17:29.349 --> 17:32.550
but then he sort of
Scooby-doo-style, you know,
unmasked himself.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.152
Oh. Secret asshole.
Yes.

17:34.154 --> 17:36.921
The worst. I think it's
my selection process.

17:36.923 --> 17:39.090
Just every guy
i get attached to, you know,

17:39.092 --> 17:41.893
turns out to be secretly,
like--

17:41.895 --> 17:43.828
yeah.
Am I in trouble?

17:43.830 --> 17:45.730
Like, am I gonna get
asshole syndrome?

17:45.732 --> 17:49.033
But it's not a secret
you're an asshole.
Oh, well, then we're fine.

17:49.035 --> 17:51.536
I think the guy thing's
just a symptom though.

17:51.538 --> 17:54.672
I think I don't know
what I'm doing generally.

17:54.674 --> 17:55.873
Hmm.
You know.

17:55.875 --> 17:59.510
If you know that,
why don't you change it?

18:00.546 --> 18:04.782
Well--
is a question
only dickheads ask?

18:04.784 --> 18:07.452
Sorry.

18:07.454 --> 18:10.721
Yeah, dragons. You know,
'cause humans just wanna
put a name on something

18:10.723 --> 18:12.356
to make it feel safe,
but really,

18:12.358 --> 18:14.425
what is a dinosaur
other than a dragon?

18:14.427 --> 18:18.029
Sorry, I feel like
we've been talking about
paleontology a lot.

18:18.031 --> 18:19.764
I don't know anything
about you.
Really?

18:19.766 --> 18:22.100
Yeah.
Well, that's too bad

18:22.102 --> 18:24.368
because I'm a fascinating
and complex person.

18:24.370 --> 18:26.404
Is that right?
Yeah, kind of, sort of.

18:26.406 --> 18:28.406
What do you do?
I travel a lot.

18:28.408 --> 18:31.442
I buy used cars,
old cars, vintage cars.

18:31.444 --> 18:34.912
I travel, looking for cars.
And I kill people,
but not so much anymore.

18:34.914 --> 18:36.647
Oh, you split the time?

18:38.117 --> 18:39.717
- Fuck!
- Hey, you okay?

18:40.719 --> 18:42.220
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.095
What was that?

18:51.097 --> 18:52.830
Goddamn it!

18:52.832 --> 18:55.066
Just some poopyhead
trying to kill me.

18:55.934 --> 18:57.401
You wanna shake him?
Yeah.

18:57.403 --> 19:00.338
Maybe he's trying to kill you.
Something you're not telling me?

19:56.361 --> 20:00.965
I think my problem is
that I have to be the best ever
at everything that I do.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.700
Like if I'm
picking out a suit

20:02.702 --> 20:05.803
or I'm waterboarding
a terrorist or I'm--
sure.

20:05.805 --> 20:08.172
Doing a soufflÃ©
or being someone's
boyfriend,

20:08.174 --> 20:10.508
I have to be
the best ever at it.

20:10.510 --> 20:13.511
I think I'm just trying
to take life more seriously
these days.

20:13.513 --> 20:15.313
What's so funny?

20:15.315 --> 20:18.516
You're just
the corniest person
I've ever met.

20:18.518 --> 20:20.484
I am.
Shuck me.

20:20.486 --> 20:22.153
But number one.
Number one.

20:22.155 --> 20:25.022
Number one.

20:25.024 --> 20:28.859
Ah. So then, like,
philosophically,

20:28.861 --> 20:30.528
you're opposed
to casual sex 'cause--

20:30.530 --> 20:33.698
I usually do it naked.
I don't know what's
more casual than that.

20:33.700 --> 20:37.401
I once dated a girl,
and we had formal sex.
Had to wear a tuxedo.

20:37.403 --> 20:40.538
Sure.
It got really sweaty.
Bow tie got all crooked.

20:40.540 --> 20:42.773
That's so stupid.
It's really stupid.

20:42.775 --> 20:45.710
I'm here every Tuesday.

20:45.712 --> 20:47.578
Try the veal.

20:48.847 --> 20:50.681
This is cute.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.850
You like that?
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

20:54.219 --> 20:55.920
Hello.
Hey.

20:55.922 --> 20:58.256
Hello. How are you?

20:58.258 --> 21:01.459
You're really pretty.

21:02.628 --> 21:05.730
That was dumb.
Corny.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.632
Yeah.
You're the worst.

21:17.709 --> 21:20.478
Oh, my god.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.513
Put that down.

21:26.718 --> 21:28.586
Oh. Hello.

21:28.588 --> 21:30.888
Mmm. Oh.
Hey. Oh.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.323
Hi.
Hi.

21:32.325 --> 21:35.159
Hey, Sophie.
Hey.

21:35.161 --> 21:37.395
Have we met before?
No.

21:37.397 --> 21:39.964
I'm the crazy guy
that Martha met
at the supermarket.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.766
Now I know where you live.

21:41.768 --> 21:43.234
- Hey, whoa!
- Oh.

21:43.236 --> 21:45.236
Awesome.

21:46.438 --> 21:48.973
Wow, you look great.
You really do like dragons, huh?

21:48.975 --> 21:52.510
And bonus tigers.
Why don't you park
those dragons right here?

21:55.647 --> 21:58.349
So, I should let you know
i still feel, like,

21:58.351 --> 22:01.585
a little messed up
over the, um--

22:01.587 --> 22:04.822
the-- the other thing,
previous thing, you know.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.924
Scooby-doo?
Yeah.

22:08.327 --> 22:11.862
So I still want you to stay
if you wanna stay though.

22:12.964 --> 22:14.532
Well--

22:16.535 --> 22:20.504
yeah!
Hang out till infinity!
Yay! I'm down!

22:20.506 --> 22:22.707
Jumping on a bed!
Yay!

22:24.710 --> 22:26.310
Sorry.

22:26.312 --> 22:30.514
If I'm being jumpy,
I'm just a little nervous.
I think I like you.

22:37.889 --> 22:40.825
You don't think that this
is too much, do you?

22:40.827 --> 22:44.695
Nah. I still think we
should've cut his head off
though, you know?

22:44.697 --> 22:46.330
Turns up the volume.

22:46.332 --> 22:48.332
Johnny moon,
you sick fuck.

22:48.334 --> 22:50.401
This is the beginning
of a new era.

22:50.403 --> 22:52.970
Once we are back in Jersey,
we're gonna be in charge.

22:52.972 --> 22:55.740
We're not gonna be stuck
in this armpit of a city.

22:55.742 --> 22:58.676
No offense.
I know you grew up here.
No offense taken.

22:58.678 --> 23:01.879
I like you.
You're not a smart guy.
You're not a tough guy.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.548
But you make big calls
and you got big balls.

23:04.550 --> 23:07.918
Getting clown nose
to kill Richie so you
can take over? Wow.

23:07.920 --> 23:11.088
This is a terrible fuckin' plan,
but I believe in it.

23:11.090 --> 23:13.324
It's gonna be fun.

23:14.192 --> 23:16.260
Hey, check it out.

23:16.262 --> 23:18.262
Houdini here is still alive.

23:18.264 --> 23:20.531
Hey, paco!

23:20.533 --> 23:22.867
You having
a rough night, buddy?
Huh?

23:22.869 --> 23:24.568
What?

23:24.570 --> 23:27.171
All right.
Okay, let's get him up.

23:27.173 --> 23:29.840
Ready?

23:31.276 --> 23:33.077
All right. You ready?
Yeah.

23:33.079 --> 23:35.813
One, two, three.

24:13.084 --> 24:14.819
- That's him?
- I like it.

24:14.821 --> 24:17.288
- Yeah.
- I like it a lot.

24:17.290 --> 24:19.256
How long you said
you've been trackin' him?

24:19.258 --> 24:22.827
FBI's been on him
for 10 years,

24:22.829 --> 24:24.628
the CIA for 15.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.831
I've been running point
for five.

24:26.833 --> 24:28.899
Why don't we just
grab him right now?

24:28.901 --> 24:30.901
Lock up the street
with snipers and SWAT?

24:30.903 --> 24:33.671
You really want to
clean up that many bodies?

24:36.575 --> 24:39.143
Yeah!

24:39.145 --> 24:41.378
I'm in love.

24:49.120 --> 24:52.490
- Are you kidding me?
- I used to make breakfast
for you all the time.

24:52.492 --> 24:55.092
Yeah, in a microwave.

24:55.094 --> 24:59.630
That guy last night,
he seemed really, like,
fancy homeless.

24:59.632 --> 25:02.299
Oh, my god.
I just realized
i don't know his name.

25:02.301 --> 25:05.970
- Who, Mr. right?
- We were together for 10 hours.
It never came up.

25:05.972 --> 25:09.640
- You slept with him
and don't know his name?
- I did not sleep with him.

25:09.642 --> 25:12.510
We slept together.
We didn't have sex.

25:12.512 --> 25:14.645
We cuddled.
It was adorable.

25:14.647 --> 25:16.981
- Okay.
- I don't need a name for that.

25:16.983 --> 25:19.116
But still,
he didn't tell you his name.

25:19.118 --> 25:21.552
You're gonna just
have to start recognizing
these red flags.

25:21.554 --> 25:23.821
Why?
You think he's evil?

25:23.823 --> 25:25.222
What if he is?

25:25.224 --> 25:28.526
When I was little,
i had this fantasy
i was dating Lex Luthor.

25:28.528 --> 25:30.661
From <i> superman?</i>
Wasn't he, like, a genius?

25:30.663 --> 25:33.564
Your guy's more like
a sexy rain man or something.

25:33.566 --> 25:36.534
Thank you.
But I don't really think
this is about him.

25:36.536 --> 25:38.669
I think you're just
in an unstable time,

25:38.671 --> 25:41.505
and maybe you're just
latching onto this guy

25:41.507 --> 25:43.841
because, you know,
the first guy you meet--

25:43.843 --> 25:47.578
- I think I'm in love with him.
Is that stupid?
- Yes. Hard yes.

25:47.580 --> 25:49.580
What is that?
I want support.

25:49.582 --> 25:53.684
- I made you a pancake.
You have to be nice.
- You're saying crazy things.

25:53.686 --> 25:56.353
I think you may be having
an early midlife crisis.

25:56.355 --> 25:58.188
That doesn't sound like me.

25:58.190 --> 26:00.524
Hmm. Pretty good.

26:00.526 --> 26:02.660
He just makes me feel--

26:03.595 --> 26:05.896
I don't know.
Like you said, Mr. right.

26:05.898 --> 26:06.931
Oh, my god.

26:06.933 --> 26:09.900
- Can you fry whip cream?
- Why not?

26:09.902 --> 26:11.802
Oh, what?

26:17.176 --> 26:20.010
<i>How come</i>
<i>you're still alive?</i>
What are you doing, hopper?

26:20.012 --> 26:23.547
<i> The company says</i>
<i> you stopped checking in.</i>
<i> What's your big plan?</i>

26:23.549 --> 26:25.883
<i>Well, I'm bringing him in.</i>
What the hell?

26:25.885 --> 26:27.785
<i> He killed</i>
<i> my whole fucking team!</i>

26:27.787 --> 26:30.254
He's mine,
and I'm taking him out.

26:30.256 --> 26:31.789
- Really?
- You have a better idea?

26:31.791 --> 26:33.557
Always.
Literally, always.

26:33.559 --> 26:36.427
I will always have
a better idea than you.

26:36.429 --> 26:39.029
I know this guy.
I know his weak spot.

26:39.031 --> 26:40.564
<i>I trained him.</i>

26:40.566 --> 26:42.633
<i>So for now, we wait.</i>

26:42.635 --> 26:45.235
Mmm.
Yeah, like pussies, huh?

26:45.237 --> 26:47.304
Yeah, okay.
Like pussies.

26:47.306 --> 26:49.873
We're in
a big pussy parade.

26:49.875 --> 26:52.610
Hey!
I'm not in a pussy parade,
all right?

26:52.612 --> 26:55.779
<i> You watch</i>
<i> your fuckin' mouth, hopper.</i>

26:55.781 --> 26:58.616
- It's the wife.
- I know what you mean.

26:59.884 --> 27:02.252
- So what's the story on hopper?
- Who?

27:02.254 --> 27:04.888
Ed hopper.
His name keeps coming up
in the files.

27:04.890 --> 27:06.957
He used to work
with our boy, right?

27:06.959 --> 27:09.893
Some sort
of master of disguise,
secret agent type dude.

27:09.895 --> 27:12.463
- I didn't read
the whole thing, but--
- of course you didn't.

27:12.465 --> 27:16.166
But if you had, you'd know
that hopper's been missing
almost 12 years now.

27:16.168 --> 27:19.103
They worked together
in the ultra program
at the CIA.

27:19.105 --> 27:21.905
That went down in flames.
End of story.

27:21.907 --> 27:25.676
Forget hopper.
Let's focus on
one psycho at a time.

27:26.845 --> 27:28.245
All right.

27:47.032 --> 27:48.599
Hey, monster.

27:52.837 --> 27:55.305
-Did you just call me "monster"?
-It's like a nickname.

27:55.307 --> 27:58.342
- Like marth, marthster,
monster, that sort of thing.
- Yeah, into it.

27:58.344 --> 28:01.979
Worth noting that nicknames
are supposed to happen
organically over time, but--

28:01.981 --> 28:04.314
I can say it
a thousand times
in 10 minutes.

28:04.316 --> 28:07.985
Monster, monster, monster,
monster, monster, monster.

28:07.987 --> 28:09.820
Monster, monster,
monster, monster--

28:09.822 --> 28:12.623
yeah, just
Stockholm syndrome me.
I love that album.

28:12.625 --> 28:14.958
It's better than Agatha.
Who's Agatha?

28:14.960 --> 28:17.361
Oh, I think Agatha
is a swell middle name.

28:17.363 --> 28:21.565
It is "swell."
It is swell 'cause
it's basically from 1935.

28:21.567 --> 28:26.537
And Martha Agatha,
it's just a double
menopause punch in the--

28:26.539 --> 28:29.039
oh. It's brutal.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.842
Hey, you wanna do,
like, a role-play thing?

28:31.844 --> 28:34.144
Where I'm an old lady?

28:34.146 --> 28:37.514
Yeah, I could get into that.
We could get a Walker, a cane.

28:37.516 --> 28:40.851
Actually,
it's my sort-of dream

28:40.853 --> 28:43.854
to eventually
be the old lady
in the neighborhood

28:43.856 --> 28:48.025
that's like
the crazy old lady,
like crazy old Martha,

28:48.027 --> 28:52.196
and just have,
like, messy white hair
and, like, ratty clothes,

28:52.198 --> 28:55.232
and I just
drive around all day
dead-eyeing teenagers.

28:55.234 --> 29:00.537
- That's awesome.
- It's, like-- it's my dream.

29:00.539 --> 29:02.506
I can't wait
to be there for that.

29:03.776 --> 29:05.676
Hey, are you hungry?

29:05.678 --> 29:07.611
Excuse me, waiter?
Can i--

29:15.286 --> 29:19.189
I'm sorry. I have to just
go outside for a second.
I'm really sorry.

29:26.064 --> 29:27.631
Hey, buddy,
here's the thing.

29:27.633 --> 29:31.935
I'm on a date,
and I like this girl.
Can't we do this tomorrow?

29:31.937 --> 29:35.472
I could kill you
in a park, at the beach.
Rent a cozy hotel room?

29:35.474 --> 29:39.076
I'd kill you there.
We'll get a big fruit plate,
hang out, hold hands.

29:39.078 --> 29:40.377
Fuck you, bitch.

29:51.956 --> 29:53.457
Are we done?

29:53.459 --> 29:55.325
Where the fuck
you going, pussy?

29:55.327 --> 29:58.896
I'm gonna kill you
and your fucking bitch.
You heard me.

29:58.898 --> 30:01.465
What?
You fucking heard me.

30:01.467 --> 30:04.434
- Come get some.
- Why'd you have to go
and threaten her?

30:04.436 --> 30:06.236
That's not
a nice thing to say.

30:09.307 --> 30:11.742
All right.
Give me a second.

30:11.744 --> 30:13.510
Yeah, come on, Princess.

30:13.512 --> 30:16.013
Let me know
when you're comfortable.

30:35.166 --> 30:36.433
Let's go, bitch!

30:39.338 --> 30:41.038
- Hurts, don't it?
- Aaah!

30:51.950 --> 30:53.016
Whoa.

30:53.885 --> 30:56.854
Okay. Fucking guys.

30:56.856 --> 31:00.224
- That guy's really homophobic.
- Get the fuck off me!

31:06.998 --> 31:09.166
All right.
Have you had enough?

31:09.168 --> 31:13.937
You could've
gotten blood on me.
This is a nice girl.

31:15.373 --> 31:17.674
I just--

31:17.676 --> 31:20.244
I want it to go well.

31:20.246 --> 31:22.246
I like this girl.

31:26.985 --> 31:29.920
- Hey, did you have to
finish a book on tape?
- No, sorry.

31:29.922 --> 31:32.189
Had to kill somebody
in the parking lot.
Some asshole.

31:32.191 --> 31:34.358
Yeah,
he was a real dickhead.

31:34.360 --> 31:38.495
Hey, you mind if I come around
to your side of the table?
Oh, yeah. Sure.

31:38.497 --> 31:40.564
Yep. Okay.
I love it.

31:40.566 --> 31:44.067
Let's fly
in the face of traditional
face-to-face dining.

31:44.069 --> 31:46.770
Yeah. There's too much
real estate between us.

31:46.772 --> 31:48.605
Anarchy.
I'm starving.

31:48.607 --> 31:51.608
After killing that guy,
you must be exhausted.
Right?

31:51.610 --> 31:53.143
Let's get some food.
Okay.

31:56.414 --> 31:58.348
I don't understand.

31:59.684 --> 32:01.852
Why would anybody kill paco

32:01.854 --> 32:03.921
and dump his body
under a bridge?

32:03.923 --> 32:05.956
Well, to get at us,
Richie.

32:05.958 --> 32:08.292
I mean, they're trying
to suss us out.

32:08.294 --> 32:12.562
I think that it is
this local big dick,
Hector Garcia.

32:12.564 --> 32:14.865
Paco must have talked.

32:14.867 --> 32:19.603
He probably let it slip
that he was helping to hide out
big-money, up-north scaries.

32:19.605 --> 32:21.204
Fuck.

32:24.209 --> 32:25.809
- We have to tell dad.
- What?

32:25.811 --> 32:27.477
We don't have to
tell dad shit.

32:27.479 --> 32:30.547
They're still cleaning blood
off the walls back at home, Von.

32:30.549 --> 32:33.550
And might I remind you
that this was your fucking mess?

32:38.456 --> 32:40.057
I apologize.

32:42.593 --> 32:45.262
- Yeah.
- I got an idea.

32:45.264 --> 32:49.266
There's word on a guy.
Big-time hit man,
wears a clown nose.

32:49.268 --> 32:52.069
Maybe he takes care
of the job for us.
Yeah. This.

32:52.071 --> 32:54.671
I like this.
He makes a statement.

32:54.673 --> 32:58.241
No. I'm not hiring some
straight-off-the-boat asshole
to fix our problems.

32:58.243 --> 33:00.677
We're supposed
to be lying low.
That's great. That's great.

33:00.679 --> 33:02.245
That's a much better
fucking plan.

33:02.247 --> 33:05.115
We'll just stay locked up
like a bunch of fucking rats

33:05.117 --> 33:07.751
waiting for the FBI to knock
on our fucking door!

33:07.753 --> 33:11.788
Oh, that's great, Richie.
Eight years of therapy
is working out beautifully.

33:11.790 --> 33:14.791
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
I apologize.

33:19.932 --> 33:22.032
I like what Johnny's saying
because this guy,

33:22.034 --> 33:23.533
he's a real international
contractor.

33:23.535 --> 33:26.670
He's this Bruce Lee,
James Bond type of
bad-ass motherfucker.

33:26.672 --> 33:30.140
We get him
to make a move on Garcia

33:30.142 --> 33:33.343
and we stop this shit
before it starts.

33:37.348 --> 33:39.149
Okay.

33:39.151 --> 33:40.817
Okay.

33:40.819 --> 33:44.588
Go, uh, find
your professional.

33:45.690 --> 33:47.357
I'll meet with him.

33:47.359 --> 33:48.558
Okay?

33:59.570 --> 34:01.471
Here you go.
Thank you.

34:03.509 --> 34:06.843
She's with a guy
who doesn't wanna be
in a relationship,

34:06.845 --> 34:08.712
so it's a real treat
for her.

34:08.714 --> 34:10.380
Ah.

34:13.016 --> 34:15.351
What's your name?
My name?

34:15.353 --> 34:19.922
Yeah. I realized
i was kinda having fun
not knowing,

34:19.925 --> 34:22.993
but now I think it's
more weird than adorable.

34:22.995 --> 34:25.695
Is it hot in here?
I don't really like my name.

34:25.697 --> 34:29.366
I just kind of--
i kinda hate it,
and it makes me angry.

34:29.368 --> 34:31.835
I've been really honest
with you about everything.

34:31.837 --> 34:34.938
It's only been a couple
of days, and that's not
a big accomplishment.

34:34.940 --> 34:38.708
I just don't like my name,
and I don't wanna tell you.
Is that okay?

34:38.710 --> 34:40.677
Okay. Weirdo.

34:42.447 --> 34:46.349
Um... how'd you do
that thing in the store?

34:46.351 --> 34:48.351
What thing?

34:48.353 --> 34:52.022
You know, like, the way
you move sometimes.

34:52.024 --> 34:53.956
It's like--

34:53.958 --> 34:56.092
it's like you know, um--

34:56.094 --> 34:58.962
oh, yeah, that thing.
Right.
Yeah.

35:00.131 --> 35:03.433
You wanna see a trick?
Okay.

35:08.739 --> 35:10.907
Is this gonna get,
like, scary?

35:10.909 --> 35:12.809
No scarier than usual,
i don't think.

35:12.811 --> 35:14.411
There aren't
usually knives.

35:14.413 --> 35:17.147
Well, first time
for everything.

35:17.149 --> 35:20.684
Ever since
i was a little boy,

35:21.752 --> 35:23.653
I've had an idea.

35:23.655 --> 35:26.456
It's more of a theory, really.

35:32.797 --> 35:35.098
Keep up.
I'm trying.

35:35.100 --> 35:38.268
Everything we see,
like, physical things,

35:38.270 --> 35:40.770
it's all just islands,
and under it, carrying it,

35:40.772 --> 35:43.740
is this sweeping current.

35:43.742 --> 35:47.477
And if you pay attention,
you can start to feel it.

35:51.616 --> 35:53.216
Yeah.

35:54.952 --> 35:59.689
You see how your hand
moves with mine?

35:59.691 --> 36:01.358
You can feel it,
right?

36:05.463 --> 36:07.097
Uh--
that's okay.

36:07.099 --> 36:09.533
Just concentrate
on the knife.

36:12.837 --> 36:15.605
Now, if we can feel
the current,

36:15.607 --> 36:18.742
we can feel other things
in the current--

36:19.777 --> 36:20.977
people.

36:20.979 --> 36:23.180
Watch the knife.

36:23.182 --> 36:26.816
We can feel how the current
will move them,

36:26.818 --> 36:29.152
and we can see
where they'll go.

36:29.154 --> 36:31.521
It's all in the movement.
You see, it pushes itself.

36:31.523 --> 36:35.125
It's easier to move with it
than against it.

36:46.003 --> 36:48.038
Jesus Christ!
What? What?

36:48.040 --> 36:50.207
Why the fuck
would you do that?

36:50.209 --> 36:53.076
- I thought you
were gonna catch it.
- Catch it?

36:53.078 --> 36:56.012
- Did you see
where it was gonna go?
- I can't catch a knife!

36:56.014 --> 36:57.547
- Sure, you can.
- No, I can't!

36:57.549 --> 37:00.417
Yes, you can.
Remember last night,
we were dancing?

37:00.419 --> 37:04.020
You have an energy.
You've got a knack for this.

37:04.022 --> 37:07.224
Shit. This is crazy.
Oh, my god.

37:07.226 --> 37:12.095
Look, I had a really
nice night or whatever.

37:12.097 --> 37:13.863
I know you can feel it.

37:13.865 --> 37:17.100
- You don't know how yet,
but I can keep showing you.
- No, no.

37:17.102 --> 37:18.768
You need to leave
right now.

37:20.438 --> 37:22.939
- You can feel it.
- It doesn't matter what I feel!

37:22.941 --> 37:24.241
Martha.

37:25.710 --> 37:27.177
Yeah.

37:29.580 --> 37:33.116
- Cool, right?
- That's so gnarly.

37:37.888 --> 37:40.223
No, no more.

37:40.225 --> 37:42.792
No more, no more.
I get it. It's okay.

37:42.794 --> 37:44.594
I should be so freaked out.

37:44.596 --> 37:46.763
Give me
one of those back.
Okay.

37:48.699 --> 37:50.600
Yeah.

38:07.551 --> 38:08.652
Yeah, baby.

38:11.922 --> 38:15.158
So, it's like a pulse?

38:15.160 --> 38:18.662
Yeah, kind of.
I never tried to explain it
to anybody before.

38:18.664 --> 38:19.929
No?
Yeah.

38:19.931 --> 38:23.199
- You never talked
to anybody about it?
- No.

38:23.934 --> 38:25.602
Why me?

38:25.604 --> 38:28.405
Because I wanted you to know.
I needed you to know.

38:28.407 --> 38:31.641
You have a-- a grace.
I just knew you'd understand.

38:31.643 --> 38:33.943
And that's how you knew
I'd catch a knife?

38:33.945 --> 38:36.279
I didn't know
you'd catch the knife.

38:36.281 --> 38:39.816
I believed you could catch
the knife. I wanted you
to catch the knife.

38:39.818 --> 38:44.254
There was no way I could know.
You're the one who did it.
You're the one who knew.

38:45.589 --> 38:47.957
Are you mad?

38:47.959 --> 38:50.694
No.
No, I'm not mad.

38:52.029 --> 38:54.130
I think I'm crazy.

38:54.132 --> 38:57.133
Me too.

38:57.135 --> 39:00.704
And also, I want you.

39:00.706 --> 39:03.139
I mean, really.

39:03.141 --> 39:05.108
I really do.

39:05.110 --> 39:07.310
I think that's doable.

39:07.312 --> 39:09.546
Shut up.
I mean, immediately.

39:57.762 --> 39:59.062
Hi.

39:59.064 --> 40:01.698
You come here often?
Oh, you didn't like
my breakfast?

40:01.700 --> 40:03.867
I gotta do this
five-second stop,

40:03.869 --> 40:06.369
and then maybe we could get
a little something.

40:06.371 --> 40:07.737
Okay.
Yeah?

40:07.739 --> 40:09.506
Cool.
Okay.

40:22.052 --> 40:25.088
It's weird.
I feel like I've been
in a coma with you.

40:25.090 --> 40:26.923
Like I don't remember

40:26.925 --> 40:30.193
what my life was like
before three days ago.

40:30.195 --> 40:32.395
Yeah. Me too.

40:32.397 --> 40:35.064
So, when we were
in bed last night--

40:35.066 --> 40:37.367
oh, no, it's fine.
I smelled it.

40:37.369 --> 40:39.903
I know. Gumbo, hot dogs.
I get it.
Oh, my god.

40:39.905 --> 40:42.605
You're such an idiot.
It doesn't bother me.

40:42.607 --> 40:43.807
It's fine.

40:43.809 --> 40:48.211
I... saw your, um--
the scar on your back.

40:48.213 --> 40:50.713
Oh, yeah.

40:50.715 --> 40:53.316
Um, well,

40:54.251 --> 40:55.919
uh, it's a long story.

40:55.921 --> 40:59.389
I was in Serbia
chasing this guy
all over the tundra,

40:59.391 --> 41:01.991
and the whole area's
a war zone,

41:01.993 --> 41:06.996
and I finally
find the guy,
and he's already dead.

41:06.998 --> 41:10.099
This is when I used to
work for the corporation.

41:10.101 --> 41:11.768
The CIA, et cetera.
Yeah.

41:11.770 --> 41:15.805
Anyway, a piece of
ceiling tile missed my heart
by about two inches.

41:15.807 --> 41:18.675
Some rubble hit my back.
That's what the scar is from.

41:18.677 --> 41:21.578
Hit me in the head,
and they said I had
brain damage.

41:21.580 --> 41:24.414
Blah, blah, blah.
Doctors. Right?

41:24.416 --> 41:27.350
And an old friend of mine
turned on me.

41:27.352 --> 41:29.185
That's why
i blew up the building.

41:29.187 --> 41:30.820
Pretty shitty, actually.

41:30.822 --> 41:34.023
Anyway, I think
it put everything
into perspective.

41:34.025 --> 41:36.826
Maybe the brain damage
helped. I don't know.

41:36.828 --> 41:38.928
Hey, there's my guy.
I'll be right back.

41:38.930 --> 41:41.030
I'll finish the rest
of the story.
Okay.

41:41.032 --> 41:42.565
Okay? You look great.

41:55.312 --> 41:56.546
Hey.

41:58.449 --> 42:00.550
You the guy?

42:02.152 --> 42:03.887
I'm a guy, sure. Yeah.

42:05.322 --> 42:08.725
Everything's in there.
Nice.

42:08.727 --> 42:12.395
Who's that guy?
Where the fuck is Richie?

42:12.397 --> 42:14.531
Who hired you?

42:14.533 --> 42:16.799
That's none
of your business.

42:16.801 --> 42:19.569
Oh, yeah.
Well, it's kind of my business.

42:19.571 --> 42:21.538
<i>What do you mean</i>
<i> Richie's not there?</i>

42:21.540 --> 42:24.440
<i>Fucking clown nose</i>
<i>is supposed to kill him.</i>

42:35.320 --> 42:36.920
Hector Garcia?

42:36.922 --> 42:39.889
Look at this guy.
He looks like serpico.
What are you doing?

42:39.891 --> 42:43.026
You want me
to kill Hector Garcia?
That's a bit ambitious.

42:43.028 --> 42:47.163
You won't tell me
who hired you to hire me
to kill Hector Garcia?

42:48.399 --> 42:49.832
Fuck you, psycho.
Psycho?

42:49.834 --> 42:52.702
Get the fuck out of here
before this shit gets ugly.

42:52.704 --> 42:56.739
You're lucky I don't
pop your ass right here.
You like clowns?

43:11.755 --> 43:15.124
Shit! He just
fucking killed the guy.
The wrong guy.

43:19.129 --> 43:21.064
Sorry. Whew.

43:21.066 --> 43:24.233
That took a little longer
than I thought.

43:24.235 --> 43:27.070
What's--
are you okay?

43:27.072 --> 43:28.638
What's--

43:30.074 --> 43:33.409
are you upset
'cause I killed that guy?

43:33.411 --> 43:38.047
Martha, how I feel about
that guy has nothing to do
with how I feel about you.

43:39.383 --> 43:40.750
Are you--

43:40.752 --> 43:44.087
um, can I go home, please?

43:46.925 --> 43:49.158
Sh--

43:50.961 --> 43:53.262
fudge.

44:00.671 --> 44:03.339
<i>The European</i>
<i>central bank on Wednesday--</i>

44:03.341 --> 44:05.108
geez, look at that.

44:05.110 --> 44:06.909
Mm-hmm.

44:06.911 --> 44:09.779
There's blood spatters
all over the place.

44:09.781 --> 44:11.914
The angle and the velocity
is all weird though.

44:11.916 --> 44:15.585
Like he's spinnin'.
Dancing.

44:16.320 --> 44:18.054
Huh?

44:19.089 --> 44:21.557
He wasn't spinning.
He was dancing.

44:24.161 --> 44:26.029
Oh, yeah. Look at that.

44:28.932 --> 44:31.601
Martha, wait a second.
Wait a second.

44:31.603 --> 44:33.202
Goddamn it.

44:33.204 --> 44:34.837
Hold on.

44:34.839 --> 44:37.140
Sweetheart, is--

44:37.142 --> 44:38.641
is this a fight?

44:38.643 --> 44:40.843
You're really upset
about that.

44:40.845 --> 44:44.113
Hey, monster, it's me.
I'm not--

44:44.115 --> 44:45.648
I'm--

44:45.650 --> 44:48.685
I don't think
before I act sometimes,

44:48.687 --> 44:51.487
but I'm not a bad person.

44:51.489 --> 44:54.457
You think bad people
have the capacity

44:54.459 --> 44:57.727
to... love and stuff?

44:59.897 --> 45:02.331
I'm sorry.
You've been through a lot,
and I'm--

45:02.333 --> 45:04.500
h-hold. Wait.
D-d-don't go.

45:04.502 --> 45:06.569
I just wanna talk to you,
that's all.

45:11.041 --> 45:12.642
Please?

45:14.712 --> 45:17.313
This is on your head.
All right, clevon?

45:17.315 --> 45:20.349
- You were supposed to
do the hire yourself.
- Shut up for a second!

45:20.351 --> 45:23.753
Why would anybody
kill our hire in the middle
of public like that?

45:23.755 --> 45:25.688
You know what doesn't
make any sense

45:25.690 --> 45:28.491
is you,
here in your fortress.

45:28.493 --> 45:29.826
Okay, listen to me.

45:29.828 --> 45:31.527
If I'd been on that bridge,

45:31.529 --> 45:33.529
your own brother
would be dead right now.

45:33.531 --> 45:35.732
- Is that what you want?
- No.

45:37.234 --> 45:39.736
I got an address.

45:40.938 --> 45:43.873
Followed him back there.
He dropped off
his girlfriend.

45:43.875 --> 45:45.975
Apartment number's
on the back.

45:47.911 --> 45:49.212
Okay, Von.

45:49.214 --> 45:52.615
Go get 10 guys, local,
then go to this girl's place.

45:52.617 --> 45:55.151
When this motherfucker
shows his face,

45:56.220 --> 45:58.354
blow his face off.

45:58.356 --> 46:00.890
What? Ten guys?

46:00.892 --> 46:03.392
Other than you and moon.
That sounds appropriate.

46:03.394 --> 46:05.461
But, Richie,
what I'm trying to--

46:05.463 --> 46:08.131
no buts.
Get outta here. Go.

46:23.448 --> 46:25.047
Martha.

46:27.084 --> 46:32.488
Martha.
There's two guys here
from the FBI to see you.

46:32.490 --> 46:34.891
Are you in there?

46:34.893 --> 46:36.292
Uh--

46:38.762 --> 46:41.664
his name is Francis munch.

46:41.666 --> 46:45.001
Formerly one of
the world's most notorious
professional killers.

46:45.003 --> 46:48.337
He's been in the game
since he was a teenager.

46:48.339 --> 46:50.773
Trained
at various programs,

46:50.775 --> 46:52.942
privatized,
became a bullet-for-hire

46:52.944 --> 46:56.145
and just a meat grinder
of a man.

46:56.147 --> 47:00.783
About two years ago,
munch had a nervous breakdown
and quit.

47:00.785 --> 47:02.752
He quit? Why?

47:02.754 --> 47:05.354
The guy has something close
to emotions, always has.

47:05.356 --> 47:07.690
Guilt. Remorse.

47:07.692 --> 47:12.428
We're guessing
these feelings just finally
caught up with him.

47:12.430 --> 47:16.199
If he's not a hit man anymore,
why did he kill that guy
on the bridge?

47:16.201 --> 47:19.202
We think he developed
a kind of moral code.

47:19.204 --> 47:20.937
He's still notorious.

47:20.939 --> 47:24.941
People still try to hire him,
but now he kills them.

47:24.943 --> 47:27.009
He kills the people
who hire him?

47:27.011 --> 47:28.477
Yeah.

47:28.479 --> 47:32.648
Because murder is wrong.

47:32.650 --> 47:34.283
That's insane.

47:34.285 --> 47:37.854
I would say that's
a reasonable diagnosis, yes.

47:38.689 --> 47:40.656
Is this the place
where we--

47:40.658 --> 47:42.225
the restaurant, yeah.

47:42.227 --> 47:45.895
He said he killed
a guy in the parking lot.
I thought he was joking.

47:45.897 --> 47:47.496
I mean,
how dangerous is he?

47:47.498 --> 47:50.433
Well-- well, now...

47:51.368 --> 47:53.369
How dangerous?

47:53.371 --> 47:56.005
There's no kind of chart.

47:56.007 --> 47:58.374
If there was,
I'd say he's near the top.

47:58.376 --> 48:01.510
He's just... gifted.

48:01.512 --> 48:03.579
Frighteningly gifted.

48:03.581 --> 48:07.550
NSA, interpol, FBI have made
a combined nine attempts
to take him into custody

48:07.552 --> 48:09.218
in the last two years.

48:09.220 --> 48:14.090
Every direct confrontation
has ended in absolute,
unmitigated disaster.

48:14.092 --> 48:16.392
He dances in,

48:16.394 --> 48:18.527
a storm of bullets and chaos,

48:18.529 --> 48:20.529
and he dances out.

48:20.531 --> 48:22.732
So now what?

48:22.734 --> 48:25.868
If he makes
any attempt to contact you,

48:25.870 --> 48:28.437
you call us immediately.

48:28.439 --> 48:30.139
You get it?

48:54.231 --> 48:56.565
<i> Please leave a message</i>
<i> at the tone.</i>

48:56.567 --> 48:58.234
Martha, it's me.

48:58.236 --> 49:00.736
Um, I know
the smart move here

49:00.738 --> 49:02.972
is to give you
some time and some space,

49:02.974 --> 49:05.074
but I need to see you
and I'm--

49:05.076 --> 49:07.743
I'm coming over.
Okay?

49:07.745 --> 49:09.612
I'm coming over.

49:15.286 --> 49:17.920
- Hi.
- Hi.

49:17.922 --> 49:19.755
Everything okay?

49:19.757 --> 49:21.223
Everything is great.

49:24.394 --> 49:26.462
Okay.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.834
Do you think
I'm in danger?

49:31.836 --> 49:34.403
We think <i> he's</i> in danger.

49:34.405 --> 49:37.640
A man he killed has
a lot of dangerous people
backing him up.

49:37.642 --> 49:41.010
But then so did the pirrellos,
and it didn't help them none.
Who?

49:41.012 --> 49:43.779
A little syndicate
in New Jersey.

49:43.781 --> 49:45.948
Drugs.
Heroin mainly.

49:45.950 --> 49:49.018
Tried to hire munch,
and he killed 'em all.

49:49.020 --> 49:51.620
Only a guy
from the cartigan family
made it out.

49:51.622 --> 49:53.189
John...

49:54.291 --> 49:55.858
Tom...
No.

49:55.860 --> 49:58.394
I forget his name.
No. You misunderstand.
I'm--

49:59.329 --> 50:02.465
do you think
I'm in any danger from him?

50:02.467 --> 50:04.333
Well,

50:05.502 --> 50:08.938
when you're
a contract killer,
you have no friends.

50:08.940 --> 50:12.108
You barely ever talk
to anyone.

50:12.110 --> 50:15.911
Just spend hours
in endless motels,

50:17.147 --> 50:18.881
cars,

50:19.783 --> 50:21.450
planes,

50:23.320 --> 50:25.554
just sitting there,

50:25.556 --> 50:28.057
staring at nothing.

50:28.059 --> 50:31.560
But around you,
his behavior is unique.

50:31.562 --> 50:34.163
He expresses himself.

50:34.165 --> 50:35.464
Emotions.

50:35.466 --> 50:38.034
Other than
that blank, happy thing
he's got going on.

50:38.036 --> 50:41.537
You're the one person
he's had any kind of
meaningful interaction with

50:41.539 --> 50:43.506
that didn't end in a bullet.

50:43.508 --> 50:46.475
So, are you safe?

50:46.477 --> 50:48.177
Are you in danger?

50:48.179 --> 50:50.980
Well, let me put it
to you this way--

50:50.982 --> 50:53.849
you're clearly
an asset to him.

50:53.851 --> 50:56.585
Which makes you
an asset to me.

50:58.688 --> 51:02.425
So you can sleep tight,
Martha.

51:15.539 --> 51:18.307
What the fuck, man?
This beauty's yours.

51:19.409 --> 51:21.744
What the fuck
i supposed to do with this?

51:21.746 --> 51:23.913
It's simple.
Bullets come out that end.

51:23.915 --> 51:26.382
They hit people
and then people die.

51:26.384 --> 51:28.784
This is like some
world war ii-ass old shotgun.

51:28.786 --> 51:31.454
You said this guy's
a supersonic
psycho killer, right?

51:31.456 --> 51:34.557
You want me to go out
like I'm duck hunting
on this motherfucker?

51:34.559 --> 51:36.258
I'm sorry, Steve.

51:36.260 --> 51:39.862
It was the best
that we could do
on short notice.

51:39.864 --> 51:43.933
He has no idea we're coming.
Walk up to the guy,
shoot him in the face.

51:43.935 --> 51:46.302
Seen crackheads in Brooklyn
with better guns.

51:46.304 --> 51:48.370
A cocksucker like you
could do it.

51:48.372 --> 51:51.640
You watch your fucking mouth,
you blinged out,
cajun green goblin.

51:51.642 --> 51:53.409
Look at this shit.

51:54.912 --> 51:57.179
I'm like Elmer fucking fudd,
man.

52:14.831 --> 52:16.999
Oh, really?
A grenade?

52:19.436 --> 52:22.204
I taught you that one,
Francis.

52:35.285 --> 52:37.453
Oi, mate.
Oh, for fuck's sake.

52:41.359 --> 52:43.292
Oh.

52:43.294 --> 52:45.261
I know, I know.

52:45.263 --> 52:47.796
Is this guy dead, or...

52:47.798 --> 52:49.298
Just unconscious.
Mm-hmm.

52:49.300 --> 52:51.467
I'm really sorry.
Okay.

52:51.469 --> 52:54.703
Do you have any--
you have a bathtub,
right?

52:54.705 --> 52:58.707
Hey, I'm not sure, um,
that you should be here.

52:58.709 --> 53:00.943
'Cause--

53:00.945 --> 53:03.612
I don't know,
i feel really confused,

53:03.614 --> 53:08.384
and... like, we should
probably take a break.

53:15.125 --> 53:18.427
What do you m--
a break?

53:22.032 --> 53:23.532
Okay.

53:23.534 --> 53:25.134
Okay.

53:36.714 --> 53:37.980
No, wait, wait.
What? What?

53:37.982 --> 53:40.983
Okay, like,
this whole reverse
hit man thing is like--

53:40.985 --> 53:42.484
it's weird. I know.
Awkward.

53:42.486 --> 53:44.320
I kill
a whole bunch of people.

53:44.322 --> 53:46.555
But they suck?
They're, like, bad people?

53:46.557 --> 53:49.491
But that's not an excuse.
I should stop.

53:49.493 --> 53:51.527
I'm just
panic-rationalizing this
to myself.

53:51.529 --> 53:55.030
Honey, you are,
but you're doing great.
Really good.

53:55.032 --> 53:57.466
Uh-huh. Okay.

53:58.535 --> 54:00.269
Okay, whatever.

54:05.208 --> 54:07.576
- What the fuck?
- Hey, Sophie.

54:07.578 --> 54:09.912
Hey, buddy.
- Is he dead?

54:09.914 --> 54:12.915
Oh, he's just
taking a nap.
I can see him breathing.

54:12.917 --> 54:14.516
What the fuck?

54:18.054 --> 54:20.222
You gonna take
the east side, right?

54:20.224 --> 54:22.091
Yeah. I see anything,
I'll let you know.

54:22.093 --> 54:24.126
Shit! Shit.

54:25.562 --> 54:28.530
Hey, uh, Knox,
look, we got trouble.

54:28.532 --> 54:32.234
<i>Twelve uglies heading</i>
<i>in the building right now.</i>
<i>Knox? You copy?</i>

54:32.236 --> 54:35.571
- Who the hell is Knox?
- He's, uh, the FBI guy.

54:35.573 --> 54:38.107
FBI?
No, no, no.

54:38.109 --> 54:40.276
That guy hopper's
a seriously mean bad guy.

54:40.278 --> 54:43.912
Haven't seen him in a while.
He looks different every time.
Who is he?

54:43.914 --> 54:45.581
It's a long story.

54:45.583 --> 54:48.217
After I left the agency,
he was--

54:48.219 --> 54:50.719
we used to work together.
We were really close.

54:50.721 --> 54:54.556
And then I said,
"i don't wanna kill people"
and he was like, "you have to."

54:54.558 --> 54:57.092
- He blew up a building
on me in Serbia.
- What?

54:57.094 --> 55:00.229
So he's <i> not</i>
with the FBI?
Nope.

55:00.231 --> 55:01.797
We're gonna be fine.

55:01.799 --> 55:03.332
Oh, Francis, I just--
what?

55:03.334 --> 55:05.768
What did you call me?

55:05.770 --> 55:07.269
Did you just call me...

55:07.271 --> 55:09.672
He told you my name?

55:09.674 --> 55:13.008
Motherfucker! Motherfucker!
Fucking motherfucker!

55:13.010 --> 55:16.945
That was unnecessary.
I'm sorry. Let's go.
No, I'm not gonna go.

55:16.947 --> 55:20.349
- Wh-why not?
- 'Cause you're a criminal,
and you lied to me.

55:20.351 --> 55:23.952
- You can't go with him.
He just killed a cop.
- Shut your face. Thank you.

55:23.954 --> 55:26.488
I never lied to you.
Not once.

55:26.490 --> 55:28.657
Martha, listen--
i guess--
yeah, that's true.

55:28.659 --> 55:31.460
I mean, I did think
you were joking,
in fairness.

55:31.462 --> 55:33.862
- Martha, we should
call the police now.
- Please.

55:33.864 --> 55:37.266
- I-I'm gonna shoot you
in the armpit.
- Great, great. Can't wait.

55:37.268 --> 55:40.703
- I would never do that.
- You brought a dead body
into our home! Hello!

55:40.705 --> 55:43.005
How about if i
shoot you in the eye?

55:43.007 --> 55:45.974
- I'm not talking to you
right now.
- I would never do that.

55:45.976 --> 55:50.479
- I'm pretending.
- We could be dead in an hour!
Martha. Martha!

55:50.481 --> 55:52.815
- Get off of me!
- Live in there now,
in silence.

55:52.817 --> 55:55.317
I'll let you out later.
I never lied to you.

55:55.319 --> 55:58.854
What do you want from me?
I'm here. That's real.
I don't know though.

55:58.856 --> 56:02.324
'Cause you show up,
and you're, like,
the greatest thing ever,

56:02.326 --> 56:04.960
and then
you kill people.

56:04.962 --> 56:08.664
And this guy's from the FBI,
but then he's not from the FBI.

56:08.666 --> 56:11.500
And I don't know.
It's just overwhelming,
you know?

56:11.502 --> 56:13.369
I don't think
it's healthy.

56:13.371 --> 56:16.538
Fuck you guys!
Nobody's norm-- nobody's normal.
Nobody's healthy.

56:16.540 --> 56:20.175
Listen. We don't have time.
So you've gotta decide now.
Okay?

56:20.177 --> 56:23.979
I love you.
What are you gonna do
for the rest of your life?

56:23.981 --> 56:27.249
You and me.
You're all I got.
Am I being crazy?

56:27.251 --> 56:29.184
Am I nuts?

56:29.186 --> 56:32.488
Let's do this.
This is it. Now, honey.
We gotta do this now.

56:32.490 --> 56:35.557
Oh, my god, stop talking.
I'm totally into it.

56:35.559 --> 56:38.560
- Yeah?
- You're both fucking insane!

56:38.562 --> 56:40.295
Let's go.

56:41.531 --> 56:43.198
This is gonna be tough.
Why?

56:43.200 --> 56:46.368
I can't kill anybody.
Last time I killed somebody,
you really freaked out.

56:46.370 --> 56:47.736
No, no, I'm fine.

56:47.738 --> 56:49.538
Okay, don't do that.
Don't do what?

56:49.540 --> 56:51.707
'Cause later
you'll say--
I'm not doing anything.

56:51.709 --> 56:53.041
Trust me?
Yes.

56:53.043 --> 56:54.543
You look hot.
You look beautiful.

56:54.545 --> 56:56.678
Hold my hand.
Okay.

57:34.918 --> 57:36.685
Oh-ho! Nice shot!

57:40.623 --> 57:42.491
Yeah! Nice, baby.

58:07.417 --> 58:09.785
You all right?
Huh?

58:09.787 --> 58:11.286
How'd you do that?

58:11.288 --> 58:13.255
Some people waste time
with the fighting.

58:13.257 --> 58:16.358
I skip straight to the winning.
We'd better get out of here.

58:25.635 --> 58:27.603
Oh, my god.

58:29.138 --> 58:30.572
Fuck.

58:31.841 --> 58:34.376
Oh-- eh--

58:35.044 --> 58:37.045
fuck!

58:37.047 --> 58:41.450
Was that even a shotgun?
What the hell was that?
What just hit me?

58:41.452 --> 58:43.318
You okay?
Fine. Fine.

58:43.320 --> 58:45.220
- Is it bad?
- You look handsome.

58:45.222 --> 58:47.189
Thanks.
How's my hair?

58:47.191 --> 58:49.825
Hey!

58:49.827 --> 58:51.827
Aah! Aah!

58:51.829 --> 58:54.830
Fuck, it hurts!
Fuck, it hurts!

58:54.832 --> 58:58.333
That was great.
That was really-- I totally
didn't see that coming.

58:58.335 --> 59:00.569
You-- you really got me.

59:00.571 --> 59:02.638
What's your name?
Steve.

59:03.973 --> 59:06.141
Too many things
happening, Steve--

59:06.143 --> 59:10.412
Martha.
Trying not to kill anybody.
I went add for a sec.

59:10.414 --> 59:12.648
Why didn't you grab her?
Take her hostage?

59:12.650 --> 59:15.083
I didn't think
that'd be cool, man.

59:15.085 --> 59:18.353
Didn't that'd be cool?
Get a load of this guy.

59:18.355 --> 59:22.224
You got talent.
Why the fuck did they give you
that piece of shit shotgun?

59:22.226 --> 59:23.559
I don't know.

59:23.561 --> 59:25.928
Baby.
We should go.

59:25.930 --> 59:28.363
Thank you
for not taking me hostage.

59:31.901 --> 59:34.336
Baby!

59:51.688 --> 59:54.389
Who the fuck
are these guys now?
Seem super pissed, right?

59:54.391 --> 59:56.959
- Yeah.
- Where the fuck is Johnny?

59:56.961 --> 59:59.861
I'm gonna kill
one of these guys.
Fine.

59:59.863 --> 01:00:02.898
It's the last one,
i promise.
No, I don't care.

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:06.068
You say that now,
but later you'll be,
"why'd you have to--"

01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:07.836
no, I don't care!
Okay.

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:12.541
Son of a bitch!

01:00:12.543 --> 01:00:14.242
Okay, fellas.

01:00:14.244 --> 01:00:18.580
So you saw that I could
basically kill all of you
guys from here, right?

01:00:18.582 --> 01:00:22.751
Was that dude your buddy?
I mean, look at that guy.
That's game over.

01:00:22.753 --> 01:00:25.921
Imagine Christmas
with his parents.
Maybe he's got kids.

01:00:25.923 --> 01:00:28.824
Oh, what if
he's got a cat?
Maybe he's got a cat.

01:00:28.826 --> 01:00:31.760
Who's gonna feed his cat?
Who's gonna feed <i> your</i> cats?

01:00:31.762 --> 01:00:36.331
I know they're paying you,
but is it worth it? We all know
how this is gonna go down.

01:00:36.333 --> 01:00:38.433
No shame here.

01:00:38.435 --> 01:00:39.935
Good?

01:00:39.937 --> 01:00:41.970
Anybody?

01:00:41.972 --> 01:00:44.439
Hey! Where the fuck
are you going?

01:00:44.441 --> 01:00:46.642
We paid you for the day!
Fuck this, man!

01:00:46.644 --> 01:00:50.278
Okay.
Anyone else?

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.247
Go fuck yourself!

01:00:52.249 --> 01:00:54.282
Oh.

01:00:54.284 --> 01:00:57.252
That wasn't very nice.

01:00:57.254 --> 01:01:00.689
Hey, we got some chips here.
We got some pitchers
of lemonade.

01:01:00.691 --> 01:01:03.625
Why don't we hang out and
talk about this for a second?

01:01:03.627 --> 01:01:06.328
- What are you doing?
- Just give me a little push.

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:07.963
It's gonna be okay.

01:01:07.965 --> 01:01:09.364
Ready?

01:01:09.366 --> 01:01:10.966
One, two, three.

01:01:16.839 --> 01:01:19.341
How you feeling, fellas?

01:01:19.343 --> 01:01:21.810
I had fun.
Nobody got hurt.

01:01:21.812 --> 01:01:25.347
Well, a little hurt.
You should call an ambulance.

01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:27.349
Hey, you.
Wanna call an ambulance?

01:01:27.351 --> 01:01:28.884
Okay, look, don't--
don't shoot.

01:01:28.886 --> 01:01:31.019
This was just
a big mistake.

01:01:31.654 --> 01:01:33.555
There you go.

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:36.658
- Have we met?
- Kinda.

01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:38.193
New Jersey, right?

01:01:38.195 --> 01:01:40.328
The poconos, the pinocchios,
or something?

01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:42.497
Yeah.
Th-the pirrellos.

01:01:42.499 --> 01:01:44.833
- Pirrellos! Yeah.
- That's right. Yeah.

01:01:44.835 --> 01:01:48.003
- Vinnie, right?
- It's Von, but don't...

01:01:48.005 --> 01:01:51.840
Yeah. You were the guy
hiding under the table.

01:01:51.842 --> 01:01:54.342
It was
my first big gunfight.
It was scary.

01:01:54.344 --> 01:01:58.380
- Vinnie, what did I tell you?
Stay out of trouble, right?
- Stay out of trouble.

01:01:58.382 --> 01:02:00.315
This isn't staying
out of trouble.

01:02:00.317 --> 01:02:04.519
I'm not the one that hired you.
That was my brother, Richie.
He is the one that you want.

01:02:04.521 --> 01:02:06.354
I literally don't care.

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:13.795
Okay, that's enough.
Get away from him.

01:02:15.698 --> 01:02:18.867
Steve, is that you?

01:02:18.869 --> 01:02:21.103
Good for you, pal.
You got me again.

01:02:21.938 --> 01:02:23.839
Martha!

01:02:24.941 --> 01:02:28.877
Clown nose. Wow.
That's a cute gimmick.

01:02:28.879 --> 01:02:32.114
You know, one time
i was gonna wear bow ties.

01:02:32.116 --> 01:02:35.684
Then I decided to be the guy who
just killed all your friends.

01:02:35.686 --> 01:02:39.087
I don't get it, man.
Why we taking this girl?
Just shoot that motherfucker.

01:02:39.089 --> 01:02:42.224
Steve, just do
what you're told.

01:02:42.226 --> 01:02:43.959
Okay?

01:02:43.961 --> 01:02:46.128
Johnny, let's go!

01:02:49.232 --> 01:02:50.966
Wait a second, Vinnie.

01:02:50.968 --> 01:02:53.802
You want her,
you come and get her.
Fremont and oleda.

01:02:53.804 --> 01:02:55.771
This is a bad call.

01:02:55.773 --> 01:02:57.739
- Hey, what about us, man?
- Fuckin' bums.

01:02:57.741 --> 01:03:00.075
That's what happens
when you craigslist criminals.

01:03:00.077 --> 01:03:02.477
Wait a second.
Bad move. Bad move, man.

01:03:02.479 --> 01:03:04.146
Bad move.

01:03:08.151 --> 01:03:09.384
You're awake.

01:03:09.386 --> 01:03:12.888
You having fun making a fool
out of yourself, Francis?

01:03:12.890 --> 01:03:14.890
Don't call me that.

01:03:14.892 --> 01:03:17.592
Wh-what happened to you?

01:03:17.594 --> 01:03:20.996
You used to be
like the grim reaper.

01:03:20.998 --> 01:03:23.965
I remember there was a--

01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:26.968
a guy, he was
a yakuza twat, I think.

01:03:28.405 --> 01:03:30.739
And he literally
pissed himself

01:03:30.741 --> 01:03:33.608
just 'cause he heard
you was on the way.

01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:35.076
What?

01:03:36.445 --> 01:03:40.515
Clown nose is tacky.
Is there some kind of joke
I'm not getting?

01:03:40.517 --> 01:03:42.184
Knock knock.

01:03:43.252 --> 01:03:46.655
- Who's there?
- The joke you're not getting.

01:03:46.657 --> 01:03:49.457
Get it?

01:03:49.459 --> 01:03:51.092
That's hilarious, Francis.

01:03:51.928 --> 01:03:54.629
Well, now it's time
to go home.

01:03:54.631 --> 01:03:56.765
You should smile more.

01:03:56.767 --> 01:03:58.767
You'd be more popular.

01:03:58.769 --> 01:04:01.303
That's a nice smile.
See?

01:04:01.305 --> 01:04:04.606
Police! Put your hands
where I can see 'em!
Stay on the ground!

01:04:04.608 --> 01:04:07.509
What took you so long?
I was waiting for backup.

01:04:07.511 --> 01:04:11.880
- Nobody's here yet.
- You're here now, so relax.
He's in custody.

01:04:13.983 --> 01:04:15.851
Why are you talking
like that?

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:20.455
Why is everything
such a problem?

01:04:22.491 --> 01:04:24.359
Oh, bollocks.

01:04:26.162 --> 01:04:28.463
It's actually
a very simple plan.
All right.

01:04:28.465 --> 01:04:31.399
The girl is exactly
where we want her.
She's in Richard's office.

01:04:31.401 --> 01:04:34.336
So the bait is set.
We wait for that maniac
to come here.

01:04:34.338 --> 01:04:36.972
He kills everyone
that stands in his path.

01:04:36.974 --> 01:04:40.075
We find an excuse, any excuse,
to get the fuck out of here.

01:04:40.077 --> 01:04:43.144
And then, blip-blap-blop,
Richard's gone,
I'm king of the castle.

01:04:43.146 --> 01:04:46.815
What doesn't make sense
about this?
I don't know. All of it?

01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:50.018
Richard
is waiting for you.

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:51.686
Thanks, dickhead.
Peace to you too.

01:04:51.688 --> 01:04:54.356
No.
Just him.

01:04:54.358 --> 01:04:57.893
You're telling me
that you shot this guy
in the face

01:04:57.895 --> 01:05:00.428
and he just
survived?

01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:03.899
It was your guys
that gave me a 900-year-old
fucking shotgun.

01:05:03.901 --> 01:05:06.001
- Really?
- So with all due respect,
mister,

01:05:06.003 --> 01:05:07.569
I don't understand
what happened.

01:05:07.571 --> 01:05:10.805
Just give me
my fucking money
and I'm out the door.

01:05:12.041 --> 01:05:14.376
I apologize.
What was your name again?

01:05:14.378 --> 01:05:16.444
Steve.
Steve.

01:05:16.446 --> 01:05:19.381
Steve, what do you like
on your pizza?

01:05:19.383 --> 01:05:21.383
Uh, cheese, man.
Yeah?

01:05:21.385 --> 01:05:23.518
Yeah?
Cheese?

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:26.855
How about
some extra cheese?

01:05:29.893 --> 01:05:33.128
Still working.
It's a good phone.

01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:35.263
Now... you.

01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:38.066
No, listen.
This is what me and Johnny
are gonna do.

01:05:38.068 --> 01:05:40.535
We're gonna go out there,
get the word out.

01:05:40.537 --> 01:05:43.038
Then we're gonna throw up
a 100-grand reward.

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:46.074
$100,000?
That's your plan?
That's my plan.

01:05:48.045 --> 01:05:50.378
That's
a stupid idea.

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:53.315
Bruce, what the fuck
do you even do
around here, man?

01:05:53.317 --> 01:05:56.051
If we don't know
where this guy is,

01:05:56.053 --> 01:05:58.586
no one can afford
to leave this house.

01:05:58.588 --> 01:06:02.590
Honestly, I think the safe bet
is to just let her go.

01:06:02.592 --> 01:06:04.926
- Hmm?
- Let her go?

01:06:04.928 --> 01:06:07.495
Really?
That's your fucking idea?

01:06:07.497 --> 01:06:11.132
You know what?
You have no idea
what you are doing.

01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:13.635
You have no balls,
no--
oh, yeah?

01:06:13.637 --> 01:06:16.237
Fuck!
Son of a bitch!

01:06:18.275 --> 01:06:21.343
I'm going to work much harder
to control my anger.

01:06:21.345 --> 01:06:23.078
But people are dead.

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:26.414
The bodies are piling up
and dad is kinda gonna notice.

01:06:26.416 --> 01:06:29.451
And the fault is yours,
you piece of shit worm-fuck.

01:06:29.453 --> 01:06:32.954
I have been defending
your worthless coke-head ass

01:06:32.956 --> 01:06:36.758
for years--
for fuckin' years.

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:38.893
And now I realize...

01:06:40.162 --> 01:06:41.596
I was wrong.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.368
You should've died
with the pirrellos.

01:06:48.938 --> 01:06:52.140
- Fuck you, Richie!
- Take the girl and get
the fuck out of this room.

01:06:52.142 --> 01:06:57.045
And I don't give a shit if
you tell mom I beat your ass.

01:06:58.114 --> 01:07:00.048
Bruce.

01:07:00.050 --> 01:07:02.650
Nobody else leaves.
No more fuck-ups.

01:07:02.652 --> 01:07:05.987
If that cocksucker
has the balls
to show up here,

01:07:05.989 --> 01:07:08.056
we hit him
with everything we got.

01:07:11.327 --> 01:07:13.328
Okay, okay.

01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:16.965
I lost track
of my dumb decisions
a long time ago.

01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:25.840
You guys had
an automatic m-16 military issue
with a laser scope,

01:07:25.842 --> 01:07:29.044
and you give me
a fucking Elmer fudd shotgun?

01:07:29.046 --> 01:07:31.246
Fuck this shit.

01:07:35.851 --> 01:07:38.386
Motherfuck,
we are totally fucked.

01:07:38.388 --> 01:07:41.489
We're gonna be stuck here
when that psychopath shows up.

01:07:41.491 --> 01:07:45.226
Will you get this for me?
I can't do it.
Yeah, we're fucked. Big deal.

01:07:45.228 --> 01:07:47.495
You started this ride,
Von.

01:07:47.497 --> 01:07:50.999
You're the one
who pushed the shit ball
rolling down the hill.

01:07:51.001 --> 01:07:52.400
Seriously?
Mmm.

01:07:52.402 --> 01:07:54.769
Will you please
shut the fuck up?

01:07:54.771 --> 01:07:57.272
Watch your mouth
with me, man.

01:07:58.541 --> 01:08:00.075
Or what?

01:08:00.077 --> 01:08:02.077
Don't let this
become un-fun.

01:08:02.079 --> 01:08:04.079
It's supposed to
be fun, right?

01:08:04.081 --> 01:08:06.347
Or I get
a bad attitude.

01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:08.917
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

01:08:08.919 --> 01:08:11.419
I'm fucking Johnny moon.

01:08:16.225 --> 01:08:17.725
What?

01:08:23.066 --> 01:08:25.033
Okay.
You wanna have some fun?
Yeah.

01:08:25.035 --> 01:08:26.634
You wanna
have some fun?

01:08:26.636 --> 01:08:28.870
What's that, baby?
I couldn't hear you
under there.

01:08:30.874 --> 01:08:33.041
Okay.

01:08:33.042 --> 01:08:35.477
This is you guys.

01:08:35.479 --> 01:08:38.279
"Oh, no!
He's gonna come
and kill us!"

01:08:38.281 --> 01:08:41.416
"I'm Johnny moon!
I love you, Von!"

01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:43.984
"I love you too.
Wanna go on
a camping trip?"

01:08:43.987 --> 01:08:45.987
"Oh, anywhere with you,
buddy."

01:08:45.988 --> 01:08:48.288
I like this bitch.

01:08:51.827 --> 01:08:53.928
So,

01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:55.830
why don't you tell me.

01:08:55.832 --> 01:08:57.966
What's it like?

01:08:57.968 --> 01:09:00.335
Having an IQ
over 17?

01:09:01.002 --> 01:09:03.171
Dating a serial killer.

01:09:05.441 --> 01:09:08.576
Now, I gotta slow you down
right there for a second,

01:09:08.578 --> 01:09:11.112
'cause to be honest, i--

01:09:11.113 --> 01:09:13.515
I don't understand
your plan.

01:09:14.316 --> 01:09:17.417
Like, is it
a "get killed" plan?

01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:19.520
Is it, like, a plan
to get killed?

01:09:19.523 --> 01:09:22.490
Like an elaborate
sort of suicide pact?

01:09:27.464 --> 01:09:28.763
Stings, right?

01:09:28.765 --> 01:09:31.032
Are you stupid?

01:09:32.635 --> 01:09:34.502
You're so fucked.

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:38.973
When he gets here,
you better hope
you're long gone.

01:09:38.975 --> 01:09:42.977
Because he's
going to kill you.

01:09:42.979 --> 01:09:46.514
And if he doesn't,
i will.

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:49.684
You're gonna kill me?
You are?

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:54.455
Well, they tell me
successful people
set achievable goals, so...

01:09:59.229 --> 01:10:02.397
How does it feel now?
Huh, bitch?

01:10:05.969 --> 01:10:07.535
I feel--

01:10:11.707 --> 01:10:14.242
I feel motivated.

01:10:17.347 --> 01:10:20.548
Motherfuckers--
"oh, do this, Steve.
Do that, Steve.

01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:23.985
Come on, Steve,
you can handle it.
Take the fucked-up shotgun."

01:10:26.822 --> 01:10:28.556
Hey,
what's going on?

01:10:29.325 --> 01:10:31.426
Uh-uh.

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:36.764
Ooh,
that looks good.

01:10:36.766 --> 01:10:39.567
How many guys inside?

01:10:39.569 --> 01:10:43.371
Got fucking Von,
Johnny, Bruce, Richie.
So that's four.

01:10:43.373 --> 01:10:46.107
Plus six other motherfuckers
with automatic weapons, man.

01:10:47.042 --> 01:10:48.743
May I?

01:10:58.887 --> 01:11:00.688
That oughta stir 'em up.

01:11:00.690 --> 01:11:04.759
- What happened to your face?
- Fucking asshole Richie
beat me with a phone.

01:11:04.761 --> 01:11:06.761
Get outta town.

01:11:06.763 --> 01:11:10.298
I'm serious, man. Motherfucker
beat me with a phone.
What a jerk.

01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:12.433
Yeah.
Can I have some
of these gummy bears?

01:11:12.435 --> 01:11:14.802
I like the green ones.
Help yourself.

01:11:14.804 --> 01:11:18.072
That's funny. I hate
the fucking green ones.
Really? Perfect.

01:11:18.074 --> 01:11:20.141
You know what I mean?

01:11:20.976 --> 01:11:23.077
Will I see you inside?

01:11:23.079 --> 01:11:24.746
That's what
they pay me for.

01:11:24.748 --> 01:11:26.614
Good luck, buddy.

01:11:27.316 --> 01:11:29.484
This fucking guy
is crazy.

01:11:30.252 --> 01:11:32.487
Von,
go to Richard's office

01:11:32.489 --> 01:11:34.455
and take him down
in the basement.

01:11:37.059 --> 01:11:39.494
You, upstairs.

01:11:46.101 --> 01:11:49.337
- Don't worry, Richie.
- Everything's under control.

01:12:13.997 --> 01:12:15.697
Motherfucker.

01:12:15.699 --> 01:12:18.299
What's going on?
Having a hard time
with that?

01:12:18.301 --> 01:12:21.002
I'm used to
a smaller caliber gun
than this

01:12:21.004 --> 01:12:23.338
let me take
a look at it.

01:12:24.473 --> 01:12:27.008
It's a nice gun.
Thanks.

01:12:27.010 --> 01:12:29.377
There you go.
You want your gun back?

01:12:30.312 --> 01:12:32.447
Do you want it back?
Please?

01:12:32.449 --> 01:12:34.549
- Psych.

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:37.318
Son of a bitch, man!

01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:39.687
- Where's Martha?
- My foot!

01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:41.389
Fuck you.

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:52.133
All right,
I'll find her myself.

01:12:52.135 --> 01:12:53.701
What?

01:12:53.703 --> 01:12:56.504
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

01:12:56.506 --> 01:12:59.073
- Aren't you gonna kill him?
- What?

01:12:59.075 --> 01:13:02.176
- You know, do your thing
with the thing that you do?
- What?

01:13:02.178 --> 01:13:06.013
The hit man thing
where they try to hire you
and then you kill them

01:13:06.015 --> 01:13:09.984
out of some fucking misguided
moral fucking purpose you have--
that crazy bullshit.

01:13:09.986 --> 01:13:13.154
No, no.
I promised my girlfriend.
I don't do that anymore.

01:13:13.156 --> 01:13:16.991
- What?
- Yeah. You ever met a girl
and it's just like--

01:13:16.993 --> 01:13:19.527
you can't eat,
you can't stop
thinking about her.

01:13:19.529 --> 01:13:22.530
Dude,
spare me the bullshit.

01:13:22.532 --> 01:13:25.266
I brought you
all the way here
to kill him!

01:13:25.268 --> 01:13:29.871
And you tell me that
you're not killing anymore?
What the fuck?

01:13:29.873 --> 01:13:32.540
I'm sorry, man.
I don't mean
to let you down.

01:13:32.542 --> 01:13:36.911
I have no desire to kill you
or your brother. I'm just here
to pick up my girlfriend.

01:13:36.913 --> 01:13:39.714
What the fuck, clevon?
Shut the fuck up,
Richie!

01:13:39.716 --> 01:13:41.883
You're letting me down
in a big way!

01:13:41.885 --> 01:13:44.719
I think you two
have some issues
to talk about.

01:13:44.721 --> 01:13:46.954
I'm just gonna
leave you to it.

01:13:50.626 --> 01:13:53.060
Richie, get off!

01:13:53.062 --> 01:13:56.798
Give me that-- ow! Hey!
What's with you
and the biting?

01:14:04.907 --> 01:14:06.541
Fuck.

01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:23.424
Hey, what's happening?

01:14:23.426 --> 01:14:26.427
- Gorgeous.

01:14:26.429 --> 01:14:30.331
Okay. What are you doing?
What is that,
like tae Kwon do or something?

01:14:30.333 --> 01:14:34.302
It's karate.
The thing is, I don't do karate.
So that's not fair.

01:14:34.304 --> 01:14:36.437
You got a fucking gun
in your hand.

01:14:36.439 --> 01:14:39.273
All right, well,
I'll tell you what.

01:14:39.275 --> 01:14:43.511
If I promise
to put the gun down,
will you not use karate?

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:46.747
Okay.

01:14:46.749 --> 01:14:49.984
All right,
I'm gonna put the gun down.
We're all good.

01:14:49.986 --> 01:14:52.453
Ow! Fuck!
That was karate!

01:14:52.455 --> 01:14:55.156
That's definitely karate!

01:14:55.158 --> 01:14:57.658
Wait a sec!
Wait a second!

01:15:01.029 --> 01:15:03.297
Oh-ho-ho!
That's a grenade.

01:15:03.299 --> 01:15:06.601
What's the plan here?
It's a small room.

01:15:06.603 --> 01:15:09.303
Th-this is bad.
It's real bad.

01:15:09.305 --> 01:15:11.138
Why do you have
a grenade?

01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:12.974
Never mind.

01:15:12.976 --> 01:15:14.709
I don't wanna die.

01:15:14.711 --> 01:15:16.544
Yeah.

01:15:16.546 --> 01:15:19.981
Okay, hold on a second.
Just stay still. Okay.

01:15:19.983 --> 01:15:23.050
Just breathe. Just breathe.
Now you're making <i> me</i> nervous.

01:15:23.052 --> 01:15:25.987
Okay, you're shaking
a little bit. Shh.
Be careful. Be careful.

01:15:25.989 --> 01:15:29.624
We're gonna do this
together. Ready?
One, two, three.

01:15:29.626 --> 01:15:31.893
There we go.
Yeah.

01:15:31.895 --> 01:15:34.662
We did that.
Why don't you sit down?

01:15:34.664 --> 01:15:37.798
Go ahead, sit down.
Relax. Just breathe.

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:41.369
Out through the nose,
in through the mouth.

01:15:41.371 --> 01:15:44.305
- Freeze!
- Hey! Whoa! Steve!

01:15:44.307 --> 01:15:45.706
Look at you.

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:48.543
That's my man Steve.
What's happening?

01:15:48.545 --> 01:15:53.014
Well, there's no way
i could get my gun. You got
a little red dot on my heart.

01:15:53.016 --> 01:15:56.250
I mean,
i don't <i> think</i> I could.
Could I?

01:15:56.252 --> 01:15:58.252
Hey.

01:15:58.254 --> 01:16:01.722
Your bosses
are in the other room
trying to kill each other.

01:16:01.724 --> 01:16:05.026
Do you hate me?
You wanna kill me?
Is that important to you?

01:16:05.028 --> 01:16:08.262
It's not worth it to me.
I'm just here
to pick up my girlfriend.

01:16:08.264 --> 01:16:11.866
So you know what?
Here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna put my gun down.

01:16:11.868 --> 01:16:13.134
Okay?

01:16:17.172 --> 01:16:18.839
What's the move, Steve?

01:16:27.082 --> 01:16:30.451
You know what?
I like you more than those
motherfuckers anyway, man.

01:16:30.453 --> 01:16:32.186
I like you too, man.

01:16:32.188 --> 01:16:35.356
Hey, you know Bruce?
Bruce, Steve.
Yeah. We met at the office.

01:16:35.358 --> 01:16:39.060
Bruce is having a hard day.
Maybe you could look
after him for a while.

01:16:39.062 --> 01:16:41.362
I gotta go.
I'll see you.

01:16:45.467 --> 01:16:47.802
Hey!

01:16:52.742 --> 01:16:54.508
- Hey, monster.
- Hi, honey.

01:16:55.210 --> 01:16:56.410
Oww!
Sorry.

01:16:56.412 --> 01:16:57.979
That was thoughtless.

01:16:57.981 --> 01:16:59.647
Terribly sorry.

01:17:00.782 --> 01:17:03.618
What?
What are you
waiting for?

01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:05.886
Gosh, you're cute.

01:17:07.422 --> 01:17:09.390
You just like me
tied up.

01:17:09.392 --> 01:17:11.225
You pervert.

01:17:12.227 --> 01:17:13.928
It's true.
Yes, I see it now.

01:17:13.930 --> 01:17:17.498
It's true. Okay.
Get in here.
Come here.

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:19.266
Mine now.

01:17:19.268 --> 01:17:20.868
Like that?
It's mine now.

01:17:22.504 --> 01:17:25.006
Why are we going
so slowly?

01:17:25.008 --> 01:17:28.442
I'm a little afraid
of that guy with the tank top.
Oh, Johnny moon?

01:17:28.444 --> 01:17:30.578
Yeah.
Is that his name?

01:17:30.580 --> 01:17:32.847
I know.
It's so stupid.
Ridiculous.

01:17:32.849 --> 01:17:35.149
You know,
he spit on my face.
What?

01:17:35.151 --> 01:17:38.152
That's not the worst of it.
He made fun of my nose.

01:17:38.154 --> 01:17:41.122
- Oh, no.
I like how the nose looks.
- You do?

01:17:41.124 --> 01:17:44.825
Yeah, 'cause it's like--
it feels like everybody's
having a good time.

01:17:44.827 --> 01:17:47.528
Yeah, well,
ideally they are,
you know, but--

01:17:49.298 --> 01:17:51.632
oh!

01:17:51.634 --> 01:17:54.301
Baby. Oh, my god.
Are you okay?

01:17:54.303 --> 01:17:56.470
Knock it off, Francis.

01:17:56.472 --> 01:17:58.305
Get out!

01:17:58.307 --> 01:18:01.809
Get outta here!
Get out! Run!

01:18:01.811 --> 01:18:05.680
All right, wait a second.
Let's talk about this.

01:18:23.365 --> 01:18:24.899
Come on.

01:18:36.678 --> 01:18:39.213
He must really like you.

01:18:39.215 --> 01:18:42.917
I sure hope so, 'cause
otherwise coming to save me
and killing all these guys

01:18:42.919 --> 01:18:45.586
is sending some
seriously mixed messages.

01:18:48.824 --> 01:18:51.826
God, can you not
laugh right now?

01:18:51.828 --> 01:18:56.697
I've got blood in my ass crack
and my face hurts
from you guys hitting me.

01:18:56.699 --> 01:18:59.333
You're being a real ass,
you know.

01:18:59.335 --> 01:19:02.603
You know, it's funny,
you being down there
and me up here.

01:19:02.605 --> 01:19:05.873
It reminds me
of when I was little.
There was this kid, Eric.

01:19:05.875 --> 01:19:09.043
This is gonna be
a great story, I can tell.
No, no.

01:19:09.045 --> 01:19:12.046
Now, this kid, he would
pick on me every day, man.

01:19:12.048 --> 01:19:15.850
He would scrunch up
my lunch bag every day.

01:19:15.852 --> 01:19:19.286
And I thought,
you know, that kid,
he's bigger than me.

01:19:19.288 --> 01:19:20.888
He's stronger than me.

01:19:20.890 --> 01:19:24.291
But--
and you're gonna like this.
He had this turtle.

01:19:25.861 --> 01:19:29.630
The most important part is,
he loved this turtle.

01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:33.701
And I thought, you know,
I'm bigger than a turtle.

01:19:33.703 --> 01:19:36.871
I'm stronger than a turtle.

01:19:36.873 --> 01:19:41.008
And you know
the sound a turtle makes
when you crush it?

01:19:46.615 --> 01:19:48.315
Screams.

01:19:49.918 --> 01:19:52.419
Now you're catching my drift,
right?

01:19:52.421 --> 01:19:56.924
Clown nose shows up,
he sees you bleeding out,
gets him thrown off his game.

01:19:56.926 --> 01:20:00.361
Squish.
Johnny moon wins.
Done.

01:20:02.063 --> 01:20:03.964
You know,

01:20:03.966 --> 01:20:08.135
truth is,
it wasn't about Eric.

01:20:10.605 --> 01:20:12.840
Truth is...

01:20:15.177 --> 01:20:18.612
You know,
i just love
crushing turtles.

01:20:29.457 --> 01:20:33.093
Aah! Oww! Fuck! Aah!

01:20:34.129 --> 01:20:36.363
Ow!

01:20:41.436 --> 01:20:43.170
Ow! You mother--

01:20:53.348 --> 01:20:54.882
just fuckin' die.

01:21:01.957 --> 01:21:05.159
I like turtles, you dick!

01:21:12.401 --> 01:21:14.401
Whoa!

01:21:22.545 --> 01:21:24.245
Johnny, Richie's dead!

01:21:24.247 --> 01:21:27.181
The guy you're calling
is dead. Sorry.
<i> What?</i>

01:21:27.183 --> 01:21:30.217
Hello? Hello!

01:21:31.052 --> 01:21:33.921
Super-good.
Super-good.

01:21:39.861 --> 01:21:42.730
It's not
that I'm angry with you.

01:21:42.732 --> 01:21:45.299
It's just
that I'm disappointed.

01:21:47.035 --> 01:21:49.169
I'm gonna take you
out into the desert,

01:21:49.171 --> 01:21:53.207
I'm gonna dose you up
on something
really, really special

01:21:53.209 --> 01:21:56.677
and we're gonna
reprogram this shit
out of your brain.

01:21:56.679 --> 01:21:58.178
Too late for that.

01:22:02.884 --> 01:22:04.451
- This is bad.

01:22:25.573 --> 01:22:28.008
Babe?
You here?

01:22:32.948 --> 01:22:35.282
Where the fuck is Johnny?

01:22:35.284 --> 01:22:37.584
And why do you have
his phone?

01:22:37.586 --> 01:22:39.787
Okay,
he told me to tell you

01:22:39.789 --> 01:22:43.090
that he, um,
wanted to go to Canada
to visit his girlfriend.

01:22:43.092 --> 01:22:45.926
They met online.
She designs jewelry.
She seems super-sweet.

01:22:45.928 --> 01:22:48.629
- Shut the fuck up.
Where is he?
- Okay.

01:22:48.631 --> 01:22:50.664
Okay.

01:22:50.666 --> 01:22:54.435
I <i> did</i> kill him.
I bashed him over the head
with a statue.

01:22:54.437 --> 01:22:56.937
And you're next.

01:22:56.939 --> 01:22:59.606
No, you-- you're lying.

01:22:59.608 --> 01:23:01.942
- You're lying!

01:23:05.748 --> 01:23:07.247
Shit.

01:23:07.249 --> 01:23:09.817
Oh, fuck!
You fucking bitch!

01:23:09.819 --> 01:23:13.454
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did that hurt?

01:23:13.456 --> 01:23:15.189
Fuck!
My fucking hand!

01:23:22.931 --> 01:23:24.999
I told you
this would happen!

01:23:25.001 --> 01:23:27.868
I told you,
but you didn't
listen to me!

01:23:27.870 --> 01:23:29.703
Nobody listens to me!

01:23:29.705 --> 01:23:31.872
God!

01:23:31.874 --> 01:23:35.242
I am a t. Rex!
I am invincible!

01:23:39.014 --> 01:23:42.483
Oh, well done.
This is great.
Thanks for this.

01:23:42.485 --> 01:23:44.051
Yeah?

01:23:44.053 --> 01:23:47.488
This isn't exactly
how I saw the day going.

01:23:47.490 --> 01:23:49.056
Really?

01:23:52.127 --> 01:23:55.462
I promised Martha
i wouldn't kill anybody.

01:23:55.464 --> 01:23:57.931
Oh, well, that's a relief.

01:23:59.067 --> 01:24:01.201
I'll tell you what,
Francis.

01:24:01.203 --> 01:24:03.804
I might not be the good guy
or whatever,

01:24:03.806 --> 01:24:05.839
but it takes one
to know one.

01:24:05.841 --> 01:24:08.342
I mean, look at you.

01:24:08.344 --> 01:24:11.712
You look like
a fucking psychopath
right now.

01:24:11.714 --> 01:24:15.682
You think you're just gonna
walk out of this life
and settle down?

01:24:15.684 --> 01:24:19.953
You'll never be normal.

01:24:20.655 --> 01:24:22.256
Good.

01:24:26.529 --> 01:24:28.395
Hey!

01:24:29.330 --> 01:24:31.365
Hey!

01:24:31.367 --> 01:24:33.934
Who the fuck
wants to be normal anyway?

01:24:33.936 --> 01:24:36.070
Oi, turn around,
you daft cunt!

01:24:36.771 --> 01:24:38.405
Francis!

01:24:38.407 --> 01:24:40.874
You're gonna make me
shoot you in the back?

01:24:40.876 --> 01:24:44.578
The truth is,
you got boring, hopper.

01:24:55.090 --> 01:24:57.558
- Hey, Steve!
- You all right, buddy?

01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:59.560
Yeah, I'm okay now.

01:24:59.562 --> 01:25:01.361
Look at you, man.

01:25:01.363 --> 01:25:04.565
The bounty on hopper's,
like, $5 million.

01:25:04.567 --> 01:25:07.768
What? This motherfucker
worth $5 million?

01:25:07.770 --> 01:25:09.736
I'm rich, bitch!

01:25:09.738 --> 01:25:12.272
Hey, you got
any green ones?

01:25:12.274 --> 01:25:14.475
I saved a couple
for you.

01:25:17.245 --> 01:25:18.979
Thanks, man.
Hey, dancer.

01:25:18.981 --> 01:25:21.548
Yeah?
Thank you.

01:25:21.550 --> 01:25:23.317
Hey, right on.

01:25:24.752 --> 01:25:27.221
Hey, dummy.
Hey, baby.

01:25:27.223 --> 01:25:29.289
You're all wet.
I <i> am</i> wet.

01:25:29.291 --> 01:25:32.893
I missed you.
I missed you.

01:25:32.895 --> 01:25:35.062
Oh, where did you
get these?

01:25:35.064 --> 01:25:37.164
I got 'em
from Steve.
Steve?

01:25:37.166 --> 01:25:39.233
Hey, Steve.
You know Steve?

01:25:39.235 --> 01:25:41.802
Baby, your pupils
are super-dilated.
Really?

01:25:41.804 --> 01:25:43.837
Did you get shot
in the face?

01:25:43.839 --> 01:25:46.773
Yeah.
I got shot in the face.

01:25:46.775 --> 01:25:48.442
You did?
Yeah.

01:25:48.444 --> 01:25:50.611
Who did that?
I'll bang him.

01:25:50.613 --> 01:25:52.112
No,<i> I</i> banged him.

01:25:52.114 --> 01:25:54.481
I banged him,
and I banged
the other guy, yeah.

01:25:54.483 --> 01:25:56.650
I banged them
right in their faces.

01:25:56.652 --> 01:25:59.419
You banged
<i>two</i> guys?
I banged two guys!

01:25:59.421 --> 01:26:01.121
That's a-list killing,
Martha.

01:26:01.123 --> 01:26:04.424
That's a clean sweep.
You got all
the main bad guys.

01:26:04.426 --> 01:26:05.592
Yeah?
Yeah.

01:26:05.594 --> 01:26:08.762
Well, you know,
i-- I make shit happen.

01:26:08.764 --> 01:26:10.864
Confidence.
Yeah, confidence.

01:26:10.866 --> 01:26:12.699
Fucking t. Rex.

01:26:12.701 --> 01:26:15.602
Rrrr!

01:26:15.604 --> 01:26:19.506
Hey, listen. We gotta go
to the hospital real bad.
Okay.

01:26:24.512 --> 01:26:27.881
Okay. Let's go.
Let's go.
You're right.

01:26:27.883 --> 01:26:30.751
Hey, Steve,
can you give us a ride?

01:26:53.074 --> 01:26:57.077
Where do you wanna go first?
Don't make me choose.
You know I'm bad at this.

01:26:57.079 --> 01:26:59.713
I'm so indecisive,
it's like torture.
Okay.

01:26:59.715 --> 01:27:03.584
I'll tell you what.
I got a plan.
Oh, yeah?

01:27:03.586 --> 01:27:07.688
JalapeÃ±o, we go to Thailand
for the allosaurus dig.

01:27:07.690 --> 01:27:11.725
Lime, we go to Brazil
for the pterodactyls.

01:27:13.861 --> 01:27:17.598
Whichever one you pick,
that's the one
you really wanted.

01:27:22.770 --> 01:27:24.738
Targets in sight.

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:27.608
Snatch and grab as soon
as they leave the market.

01:27:27.610 --> 01:27:30.310
 <i>Copy that.
</i> <i>Alpha team in position.</i>

01:27:32.013 --> 01:27:35.182
Oh! JalapeÃ±o!
I'm really happy.

01:27:35.184 --> 01:27:37.384
- I wanted it to be
the jalapeÃ±o.
- Thailand?

01:27:37.386 --> 01:27:39.186
Yeah!
Thailand it is.

01:27:39.188 --> 01:27:44.291
- He's got nowhere to go.
- <i>Echo team,</i> <i> prepare for lockdown.</i>

01:27:44.293 --> 01:27:46.293
<i>Target has something</i>
<i>in his hand.</i>

01:27:46.295 --> 01:27:47.861
Wait.
<i> Could be a weapon.</i>

01:27:47.863 --> 01:27:50.063
- What's he doing?
<i>- Echo team, what can you see?</i>

01:27:50.065 --> 01:27:53.400
What's he doing?
<i>We've lost visual contact</i>
<i>with the female target.</i>

01:27:53.402 --> 01:27:55.235
We've been spotted.
Shit!

01:27:55.237 --> 01:27:57.971
Where's the girl?
Who's got eyes on the girl?

01:27:57.973 --> 01:28:01.074
Oh, shit.

01:28:01.076 --> 01:28:03.543
What you looking at?
