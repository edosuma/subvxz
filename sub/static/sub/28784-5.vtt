00:02.270 --> 00:04.500
MRS. BASKETS:
So, because I am

00:04.600 --> 00:07.070
going to Denver
with my fiancÃ© Ken,

00:07.170 --> 00:10.840
who's having some
carpet issues right now,

00:10.940 --> 00:14.210
I'd like to take
this opportunity to make

00:14.310 --> 00:16.780
a transfer of power...

00:16.880 --> 00:18.550
from me, Christine Baskets,

00:18.650 --> 00:20.750
to... my Chippy

00:20.850 --> 00:23.690
as the new CEO

00:23.790 --> 00:26.720
-of Baskets Rodeo.
-Hoo, hoo, hoo!

00:26.820 --> 00:28.260
-Thanks, everybody.
-But don't worry.

00:28.360 --> 00:29.860
Because I've installed

00:29.960 --> 00:31.860
all these cameras so that

00:31.960 --> 00:35.230
I can keep an eye
on things from Denver.

00:35.330 --> 00:37.800
How about that Internet,
isn't it crazy?

00:37.900 --> 00:39.640
I've ordered a neti pot
that's gonna be

00:39.740 --> 00:41.940
at my house when I get home.
(laughs)

00:42.040 --> 00:44.540
So crazy. Oh, and...

00:44.640 --> 00:47.110
guess what? I got you

00:47.210 --> 00:50.110
-some business cards.
-Oh, look at that.

00:50.210 --> 00:52.880
-MRS. BASKETS: Yes.
-CHIP: Why does it have
a wrench on it?

00:52.980 --> 00:54.620
Because you're a hard worker.

00:54.720 --> 00:56.750
Speech. Let's hear
some applause.

00:56.850 --> 00:58.620
Speech! Speech!

00:58.720 --> 01:00.820
-Words of wisdom!
-Hoo, ho, ho!

01:00.920 --> 01:02.730
CHIP:
Thanks, Mom. Okay.
Uh, I'd like to thank,

01:02.830 --> 01:04.959
uh, first and foremost,
I'd like to thank my mother,

01:05.060 --> 01:07.460
-um, who...
-MRS. BASKETS: I've got
to go, honey.

01:07.560 --> 01:09.500
I'm going to the airport,
but keep it going.

01:09.600 --> 01:12.140
Listen to him,
he's got words to say.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.840
EDDIE:
Okay, everybody back to work.

01:14.940 --> 01:17.470
I had more of a speech.
Do you guys want to hear it?

01:17.570 --> 01:20.640
-No, I don't. Do you?
-Nah, I'm good.

01:20.740 --> 01:22.450
-No.
-Fair enough.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.910
-(birds chirping)
-CHIP: Okay.

01:25.010 --> 01:27.020
"You Alive" youth conference.

01:27.120 --> 01:29.450
Where are my notes on tha--
Okay, yeah. So you guys

01:29.550 --> 01:32.120
just want to rent the arena
for just the one evening,

01:32.220 --> 01:33.960
-correct?
-Yes. Yes.

01:34.060 --> 01:35.960
And, uh, you're gonna
do a talent show?

01:36.060 --> 01:37.160
-That's right.
-In the arena?

01:37.260 --> 01:39.130
Y-You have to see it.
It's amazing.

01:39.230 --> 01:41.030
I mean, these-- Some of these
kids are so talented.

01:41.130 --> 01:42.500
Some of them are... are awful.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.300
But-but most of them
are really, really good.

01:44.400 --> 01:46.370
Okay, great.
I just need you to sign...

01:46.470 --> 01:48.300
some insurance...

01:48.400 --> 01:50.310
waivers, they're just
standard...

01:50.410 --> 01:51.840
insurance waivers.

01:51.940 --> 01:53.680
-"Accidents"?
-Yeah. Well, you know,

01:53.780 --> 01:55.680
if there's any...
paraphernalia that...

01:55.780 --> 01:58.350
someone gets hit by,
like, a crucifix, or...

01:58.450 --> 02:01.880
you know, maybe
a Bible fight breaks out.

02:01.980 --> 02:03.490
Oh, yeah.

02:03.590 --> 02:05.120
Yeah. Absolutely.

02:05.220 --> 02:07.120
-Um, here's my business card.
-Uh-huh.

02:07.220 --> 02:09.330
In case you need me.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.030
It has my phone number,
even with the area code.

02:11.130 --> 02:13.200
Hey, you seem to be
really taking kind of

02:13.300 --> 02:15.030
a leadership role with this.

02:15.130 --> 02:16.700
Well, I'm a CEO now. Uh...

02:16.800 --> 02:19.130
-(Daniel chuckles)
-Chief...

02:19.240 --> 02:21.640
-E-- Chief E.O.
-You know, Chip,

02:21.740 --> 02:24.510
I-I'm very,
very excited for you.

02:24.610 --> 02:27.480
-I'm very impressed. (chuckles)
-Well...

02:27.580 --> 02:29.680
that means a lot...
coming from you, Reverend.

02:29.780 --> 02:31.580
-Thank you so much.
So I guess, uh, done deal.
-Okay.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.350
-Thank you so much.
-Okay, all right.

02:33.450 --> 02:35.580
-And let me know
if you ever need a CEO...
-I will.

02:35.680 --> 02:37.250
-...at the church. Great.
-Yeah, yeah.

02:37.350 --> 02:39.720
-Wonderful. (groans)
-Mm-hmm. Oh...

02:44.760 --> 02:47.200
-(chair clatters)
-Got it. Shit!

02:48.930 --> 02:51.230
(items clattering)

02:51.330 --> 02:52.870
-Had a number two pencil...
-Oh.

02:52.970 --> 02:54.570
-Yeah, um...
-There it is.

02:54.670 --> 02:57.740
That's actually mine...
I-it's okay. It's okay.

02:57.840 --> 03:00.340
Yeah, abso-- whoa.

03:03.550 --> 03:05.010
Monica?

03:05.110 --> 03:06.620
CHRISTINE:
They just leave the door open?

03:06.720 --> 03:08.880
Well, you can do that in
this neighborhood. Monica?

03:08.980 --> 03:11.050
-Well, hello. Look at you!
-Oh, Monica!

03:11.150 --> 03:13.260
-Oh...
-How are you?

03:13.360 --> 03:14.760
...it's so nice to see you.

03:14.860 --> 03:16.060
Nice-- oh, and hi, hi, Dad.

03:16.160 --> 03:17.590
-Hello.
-Aw.

03:17.690 --> 03:19.430
-Oh, good to see you, too.
-You, too.

03:19.530 --> 03:21.700
-I wish it was under
better circumstances.
-Well,

03:21.800 --> 03:23.730
I think, for the moment, we have
everything under control.

03:23.830 --> 03:25.730
Then we'll just hear more
about it in the morning, so...

03:25.830 --> 03:27.370
(inhales sharply)
...in the meantime,

03:27.470 --> 03:28.770
-let me grab your bags.
-Okay.

03:28.870 --> 03:29.940
'Cause I have the room
all set up.

03:30.040 --> 03:32.240
-Oh, how lovely.
-Yeah.

03:32.340 --> 03:34.580
Well, since we don't have
a carpet emergency

03:34.680 --> 03:36.110
until tomorrow,

03:36.210 --> 03:38.810
why don't you put on
something nice, honey?

03:38.910 --> 03:40.320
What's up? Why?

03:40.420 --> 03:42.050
It's a surprise.

03:42.150 --> 03:44.050
Oh!

03:44.150 --> 03:46.260
Ken!

03:47.890 --> 03:49.760
(thudding)

03:55.430 --> 03:56.830
Hello?

03:56.930 --> 03:58.300
(thudding continues)

04:04.740 --> 04:07.640
Okay, well, um...

04:12.820 --> 04:14.750
Hello?

04:18.350 --> 04:19.990
(boys laughing, chatting)

04:20.089 --> 04:21.959
Hey!

04:22.060 --> 04:23.530
-Go. Go. Go.
-Hey, how did you kids

04:23.630 --> 04:24.760
-get in here?
-Shut up,

04:24.860 --> 04:26.260
-old man.
-Excuse me?!

04:26.360 --> 04:28.000
I'm not an old man.

04:28.100 --> 04:29.700
-(boys laugh)
-Hey, guys, stop. Stop, stop,

04:29.800 --> 04:32.030
stop. Hold on.

04:32.130 --> 04:34.540
Listen, I'm cool.

04:34.640 --> 04:36.670
I'm not that old. You know?

04:36.770 --> 04:40.540
I'm in my mid-to-very-late 40s,
and, uh...

04:40.640 --> 04:42.710
But I was once your age.

04:42.810 --> 04:44.650
So-so I get it.

04:44.750 --> 04:46.880
I can relate.

04:46.980 --> 04:48.550
School sucks.

04:48.650 --> 04:50.190
It does.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.320
Mom's always yelling at you.

04:52.420 --> 04:55.490
"Turn that Sheryl Crow music
down!" Right?

04:55.590 --> 04:58.190
But I've improved myself.

04:58.290 --> 04:59.900
I've picked myself up
by the bootstraps.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.060
I've been listening to these...
these self-help tapes,

05:02.160 --> 05:03.400
and I'd love
to sit you fellas down

05:03.500 --> 05:05.400
and maybe, you know, talk to you

05:05.500 --> 05:06.900
about why you're
acting out and...

05:07.000 --> 05:08.740
-You're dumb.
-(boys laugh)

05:08.840 --> 05:10.210
Let's go.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.240
Hey, nice tie.

05:11.340 --> 05:12.580
Hey. Uh, hey, guys?

05:12.680 --> 05:14.810
Hey, guys?

05:14.910 --> 05:16.980
Just think about what I said!

05:21.850 --> 05:24.690
(country song playing)

05:24.790 --> 05:26.820
Hey, Carpet King.

05:26.920 --> 05:28.190
-Hey, how are you, sir?
-Good.

05:28.290 --> 05:29.530
-Fine. Good to see you.
-Good to see you.

05:29.630 --> 05:31.090
Howdy, ma'am.

05:31.190 --> 05:32.760
-Who's that, the mayor?
-Oh, I don't know.

05:32.860 --> 05:34.700
People just recognize me
from the commercials.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.830
Been doing them
for so many years.

05:36.930 --> 05:38.700
-Oh, so good.
-Mmm.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.570
-Enjoying it?
-I love it.

05:40.670 --> 05:42.510
-The music. The food.
-Mmm. Mmm.

05:42.610 --> 05:44.870
I can't believe
you ordered snake.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.740
-It's a rattler.
-Mmm.

05:46.840 --> 05:48.880
(chuckles) Have you tried

05:48.980 --> 05:50.410
the-the buffalo? It's tasty.

05:50.510 --> 05:51.950
WOMAN:
Oh, my God.

05:52.050 --> 05:54.180
-Oh.
-Ken, is that you?

05:54.280 --> 05:58.050
-Donna,
it is so good to see you.
-Oh! (chuckles)

05:58.150 --> 05:59.290
KEN:
Oh, my goodness, me.

05:59.390 --> 06:00.960
-DONNA:
Does this mean you're back?
-Oh, no.

06:01.060 --> 06:02.730
No, no,
I'm just in town for a bit

06:02.830 --> 06:04.690
to help the girls. Carpet stuff.

06:04.790 --> 06:06.760
Damn. Thought we got you back.

06:06.860 --> 06:08.430
-(Ken chuckles)
-Denver's just not the same

06:08.530 --> 06:11.270
-without its carpet king.
-Aw. Oh, Christine.

06:11.370 --> 06:13.240
This is my dear friend, Donna.

06:13.340 --> 06:14.870
-Hi, Donna.
-This is her place.

06:14.970 --> 06:16.810
-Oh, I love it.
-Oh, thank you.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.610
-Oh, my goodness. It's so...
-Thank you very much.

06:18.710 --> 06:20.410
You have any boar?

06:20.510 --> 06:21.810
(Ken and Donna laugh)

06:21.910 --> 06:24.550
I've known Ken since the '70s.

06:24.650 --> 06:26.420
-KEN: Mm-hmm. Oh!
-Wow.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.920
Christine
is my beautiful bride-to-be.

06:29.020 --> 06:30.920
-MRS. BASKETS: Oh.
-DONNA: Are you kidding?

06:31.020 --> 06:32.560
Well, that's amazing!

06:32.660 --> 06:35.620
(chuckles): I never thought
anybody would get him.

06:35.720 --> 06:36.990
But you did it, finally.

06:37.090 --> 06:39.330
I guess you could say
I bagged him, Donna.

06:39.430 --> 06:41.100
(laughter)

06:41.200 --> 06:43.800
-Dinner's on us.
-Oh, Donna.

06:43.900 --> 06:46.500
I'm gonna send over
a bottle of champagne.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.270
Oh, how kind.

06:48.370 --> 06:51.410
(clears throat)
Well, Miss Baskets,

06:51.510 --> 06:53.780
may I have this dance?

06:53.880 --> 06:57.310
* Bells toll at free home *

06:57.410 --> 07:02.320
* And time
a-runnin' around... *

07:02.420 --> 07:06.620
I feel like I'm in some sort
of a fairy tale.

07:06.720 --> 07:09.190
Maybe you are.

07:09.290 --> 07:11.190
* Be in that town... *

07:24.470 --> 07:25.470
Let me see these.

07:25.570 --> 07:26.510
These beans are eight years old.

07:26.610 --> 07:28.680
I have given you and your dad

07:28.780 --> 07:30.610
a lot of Internet. Tell your dad

07:30.710 --> 07:32.680
not one more megabyte
of Internet

07:32.780 --> 07:35.620
if he keeps bringing me
expired beans.

07:35.720 --> 07:37.620
My Lord.

07:37.720 --> 07:39.320
-(keys clacking)
-Dear diary,

07:39.420 --> 07:42.360
had another encounter
with the bean boy.

07:42.460 --> 07:44.160
Oh, well, look who it is!

07:44.260 --> 07:45.890
The mascot
from the Men's Wearhouse.

07:45.990 --> 07:48.530
Well, I'm running the rodeo
without Mom now.

07:48.630 --> 07:50.870
(exhales) You?

07:50.970 --> 07:54.470
(sighs) I mean, if Mom wanted
to destroy the rodeo,

07:54.570 --> 07:57.240
she could've at least burned
it down for the insurance money.

07:57.340 --> 07:58.670
-Yeah.
-That makes sense.

07:58.770 --> 08:00.480
Hey, Dale, you have
a lot of stuff here.

08:00.580 --> 08:02.180
Do you have any barbed wire,
chains, or locks

08:02.280 --> 08:03.550
that I could borrow?

08:03.650 --> 08:06.880
I have a lot of stuff here,
yeah. Why?

08:06.980 --> 08:08.350
Well, Reverend Kwon
has rented the rodeo

08:08.450 --> 08:09.820
for a youth conference
for one night,

08:09.920 --> 08:11.020
and they're having
a talent show,

08:11.120 --> 08:12.420
and I just wanted
to beef up security.

08:12.520 --> 08:14.360
Why? Was there an incident?

08:14.460 --> 08:15.560
No.

08:15.660 --> 08:16.930
Are you sure?
'Cause it sounds like

08:17.030 --> 08:18.990
-there was a incident.
-Well, okay,

08:19.090 --> 08:20.430
some skater kids
broke in last night

08:20.530 --> 08:21.900
and they were
just messing around.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.700
Skater kids?

08:23.800 --> 08:25.400
-Damn this youth culture.
-Yeah,

08:25.500 --> 08:27.270
-it's not a big deal, though.
-Yeah, it is a big deal.

08:27.370 --> 08:29.740
I know this Bakersfield trash
and all they want to do

08:29.840 --> 08:32.679
is take away the fun
from these good Christian kids.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.409
Yeah, I just wanted
to secure the gates

08:34.510 --> 08:36.409
-a little bit more, that's all.
-I'll tell you what.

08:36.510 --> 08:37.909
You're not very
competent, right?

08:38.010 --> 08:40.049
I think everybody
can agree on that.

08:40.150 --> 08:41.520
I'm gonna help you
with these twerps.

08:41.620 --> 08:43.620
-No, I-I don't,
I don't need your help.
-Listen.

08:43.720 --> 08:46.120
I think I can help you, I mean,
I'm trying to shift my life

08:46.220 --> 08:48.220
a little bit, but I-I can't let
the family business

08:48.320 --> 08:49.460
just be this vulnerable.

08:49.560 --> 08:51.130
All right?

08:51.230 --> 08:53.360
And you're dealing
with wild teenagers,

08:53.460 --> 08:57.530
so you're gonna need a wild man
to deal with them.

08:57.630 --> 08:59.600
And I'll throw in the chains
and the barbed wire

08:59.700 --> 09:02.870
and the locks for free. Okay?

09:02.970 --> 09:04.140
Deal?

09:04.240 --> 09:06.310
-Okay.
-Okeydokey.

09:06.410 --> 09:08.580
See you at the rodeo.

09:08.680 --> 09:10.780
(whispering):
I'm looking forward to it.

09:12.380 --> 09:15.080
Okay, where was I?

09:15.180 --> 09:16.890
Oh, beans.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.750
Does anybody have any white-out?

09:18.850 --> 09:20.120
MAN:
Yeah! White power!

09:20.220 --> 09:23.230
No, I said white-out,
not white power.

09:26.600 --> 09:27.800
DALE:
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

09:27.900 --> 09:29.730
Watch out for
the booby trap, please.

09:29.830 --> 09:32.300
-What? What is all this?
-It's a booby trap.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.740
So what I have is
a trip line there

09:34.840 --> 09:37.670
and it's going right up to that
pulley, that pulley takes it

09:37.770 --> 09:39.980
to that pulley,
and the rope goes all the way

09:40.080 --> 09:43.080
to this box, and if you hit
the trip wire there,

09:43.180 --> 09:45.950
this cinder will come and
smack you right in the face.

09:46.050 --> 09:48.950
-(chuckles)
-Dale, we're gonna
catch them okay?

09:49.050 --> 09:50.420
We're not gonna kill them.

09:50.520 --> 09:51.950
Then why'd I bring all my guns?

09:52.050 --> 09:54.860
I mean, this is
a "stand your ground" situation.

09:54.960 --> 09:57.190
Because we just want
to teach them a lesson.

09:57.290 --> 10:00.200
Teach them a lesson?
Chip, you are naive.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.600
The only lesson that
these kids understand

10:02.700 --> 10:04.300
is a cinderblock to the face.

10:04.400 --> 10:05.600
(Dale chuckles)

10:05.700 --> 10:07.770
Okay, I'll see you around, Dale.
Have a good one.

10:10.270 --> 10:12.840
(chuckles) Well, that would've
hurt, wouldn't it have?

10:12.940 --> 10:15.010
Yeah, that would've killed me.

10:17.380 --> 10:18.980
What? Dale?

10:19.080 --> 10:21.450
Oh, God!

10:21.550 --> 10:23.390
Oh, those two.

10:23.490 --> 10:25.450
-Well, we're here.
-Oh!

10:25.550 --> 10:28.390
-Oh, my God, you're a giant.
-(Ken chuckles)

10:28.490 --> 10:30.390
Is that even legal?

10:30.490 --> 10:32.560
We're not talking
total recall here?

10:32.660 --> 10:34.500
No, no, no.
We're a long way from recall.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.630
Yeah. Don't even say recall,
don't even speak that word.

10:36.730 --> 10:38.700
I'll be just a minute, honey.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.700
("Making Eyes" by David Lawrence
& Robert Chaney playing)

10:48.980 --> 10:50.410
(sighs)

10:50.510 --> 10:52.880
(grunts) Berber.

10:56.180 --> 10:58.590
Private? Hmm.

11:03.860 --> 11:05.230
(knocks on door)

11:11.870 --> 11:13.040
KEN:
Christine?

11:13.140 --> 11:15.900
-Ken?
-Ah.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.540
-I'm snooping.
-There you are.

11:17.640 --> 11:20.680
-(both laugh)
-Oh, what's all this?

11:20.780 --> 11:22.610
Well, when I first
got into the business,

11:22.710 --> 11:24.050
I kind of held back

11:24.150 --> 11:26.280
some of the high-end stuff
for myself.

11:26.380 --> 11:28.780
This is genuine Moroccan Alpaca.

11:28.880 --> 11:31.590
I got it at Salt Lake
at an auction in the '90s.

11:31.690 --> 11:34.720
Auction? Kenny,
you at an auction? Oh, my God.

11:34.820 --> 11:37.290
Well, I mean,
there is an art to it.

11:37.390 --> 11:40.030
Yeah, the, uh, the home
and business carpeting,

11:40.130 --> 11:42.030
that's my bread and butter,
but this?

11:42.130 --> 11:44.370
Oh, this is my passion.
That's why it's gonna be

11:44.470 --> 11:46.370
-so hard to turn it loose.
-Huh.

11:46.470 --> 11:48.600
You know, I don't think
the girls are gonna be able

11:48.700 --> 11:51.810
to join us for lunch.
They have so much to do here,

11:51.910 --> 11:54.810
but we better get going.
Gloria is probably almost there.

11:54.910 --> 11:57.450
Gloria? Your ex-wife?

11:57.550 --> 11:59.480
Oh, Christine, yeah,
I forgot to tell you.

11:59.580 --> 12:02.620
She heard we were in town and
she really wanted to meet you.

12:02.720 --> 12:05.290
So we better get going if
we're gonna get there by 1:00.

12:05.390 --> 12:07.790
-I'll meet you out front.
-Okay.

12:10.060 --> 12:11.560
The right purchase order...?

12:11.660 --> 12:13.130
DALE:
I've been staking the place
for about an hour

12:13.230 --> 12:15.600
and I can't find your
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turds.

12:15.700 --> 12:18.600
-Where are the teenagers?
-Dale, I don't know. I mean,

12:18.700 --> 12:20.940
for all I know they-they--
I scared them off last night.

12:21.040 --> 12:22.810
Now leave me alone.
I've got some work to do

12:22.910 --> 12:24.270
for the Youth Conference
tomorrow.

12:24.370 --> 12:25.910
Chip, when are you gonna
take this stuff seriously?

12:26.010 --> 12:28.340
I mean, there's been
a breach, I think, here,

12:28.440 --> 12:29.980
-and it's important that...
-(metallic clang)

12:30.080 --> 12:31.510
What was that?

12:31.610 --> 12:33.650
Let me check
the security camera.

12:33.750 --> 12:35.320
You have surveillance on there?

12:35.420 --> 12:38.790
Oh, look at this.

12:38.890 --> 12:41.290
(chuckling): Oh, yeah,
right where I want 'em.

12:41.390 --> 12:42.690
Let's go get 'em.

12:42.790 --> 12:45.290
-(spray painting)
-(chuckling): Yeah.

12:45.390 --> 12:48.330
I mean, what bothers me about it
it's in broad daylight.

12:48.430 --> 12:51.930
These Bakersfield kids
have no couth. None.

12:52.030 --> 12:54.500
-(boys laughing)
-BOY: You like that?

12:54.600 --> 12:56.870
-Okay, what's the plan?
-The plan is, you wouldn't

12:56.970 --> 12:59.510
let me bring my gun,
so I had to go to the hen house

12:59.610 --> 13:01.180
-to get some weaponry.
Move. Move!
-Dale!

13:01.280 --> 13:04.310
Hey! How do you like
your eggs, boys? Huh?

13:04.410 --> 13:06.280
-Whoa! We got to go.
-How do you like your eggs?

13:06.380 --> 13:09.550
-You better run,
you street urchins! Run!
-Dale!

13:09.650 --> 13:11.190
-(chuckling): Oh, yeah!
-They're kids, Dale.

13:11.290 --> 13:13.790
I'll strike you
and your parents!

13:13.890 --> 13:15.290
(chuckles):
Oh!

13:15.390 --> 13:16.790
What are you gonna do now, son?

13:16.890 --> 13:18.690
Huh? You want to dance,
do you?

13:18.790 --> 13:20.360
-Do you want to dance? Huh?
-Dale.

13:20.460 --> 13:22.200
-Dale, put the eggs down.
-Yeah. Oh.

13:22.300 --> 13:23.230
Not now, Chip.

13:23.330 --> 13:24.230
Whoa, there's two of 'em?

13:24.330 --> 13:25.730
-(chuckles): Oh. Oh.
-Dale.

13:25.830 --> 13:26.840
-Come on, let's go!
-(boys shouting)

13:26.940 --> 13:29.340
-Move, Chip!
-(groans)

13:29.440 --> 13:32.140
-You better run!
You pieces of shit!
-Go, go, go, go! Go! Run!

13:32.240 --> 13:34.240
(shouting indistinctly)

13:34.340 --> 13:37.150
(quietly):
Booby trap was a bust.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.480
(sighs)

13:38.580 --> 13:41.520
Well, you were no help, Chip!

13:41.620 --> 13:42.680
That's for sure.

13:42.780 --> 13:43.920
That's how it's done, son.

13:44.020 --> 13:44.920
Right there.

13:45.020 --> 13:46.890
-You okay?
-Yeah.

13:46.990 --> 13:48.920
Yeah. Yeah, Dale, I'm fine.

13:53.760 --> 13:54.700
Well, this is war.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.100
-(laughing)
-(laughs) And that's when

14:02.200 --> 14:04.110
you used to drag us
every year on those ski trips.

14:04.210 --> 14:05.740
-(laughs)
-Oh, Monica and Ivy loved it.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.010
Are you kidding?

14:07.110 --> 14:09.210
They used to spend
the entire day

14:09.310 --> 14:11.610
with me in the lodge
while he was out skiing.

14:11.710 --> 14:14.050
He's a great skier.
Did he tell you that?

14:14.150 --> 14:16.050
-(exhales)
-No.

14:16.150 --> 14:18.390
I'll be back. Restroom.

14:18.490 --> 14:20.390
You still do that.

14:20.490 --> 14:22.560
He can't stand compliments.

14:22.660 --> 14:24.230
-Mm.
-(chuckles)

14:24.330 --> 14:26.090
(sighs)

14:26.190 --> 14:28.560
So, um...

14:28.660 --> 14:30.900
(clears throat)
How-how is...

14:31.000 --> 14:33.900
the house coming along?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.770
The house is fine.

14:36.870 --> 14:39.540
You know,
you can ask me anything.

14:39.640 --> 14:42.780
I know you set
this little rendezvous up.

14:42.880 --> 14:44.910
-What-what do you mean?
-I mean...

14:45.010 --> 14:45.980
Well, he's gone to urinate.

14:46.080 --> 14:47.420
Now you can ask me anything
you want

14:47.520 --> 14:49.250
about myself or why I'm here

14:49.350 --> 14:52.750
or how I swooped in
and took your... place.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.760
Oh, no. No, no, no.

14:54.860 --> 14:58.390
Christine, I'm-I'm sure
Ken forgot to tell you

14:58.490 --> 14:59.930
that we were having lunch today.

15:00.030 --> 15:03.130
(scoffs)
That's just like Ken.

15:03.230 --> 15:04.970
I-I'm so sorry, Christine.

15:05.070 --> 15:08.600
I-I'm sure this must
really be awkward for you.

15:08.700 --> 15:11.810
Well, I thought--
I mean, I-I didn't know

15:11.910 --> 15:13.240
why you'd want to meet me.

15:13.340 --> 15:15.310
Well, I've heard so much
about you.

15:15.410 --> 15:19.410
And I really wanted you to know
that there's absolutely no,

15:19.510 --> 15:22.350
no bad blood at all
between Ken and I.

15:22.450 --> 15:24.420
We just didn't work as a couple.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.690
We work great as friends.

15:26.790 --> 15:28.020
But you?

15:28.120 --> 15:30.290
You guys work great as a couple.

15:30.390 --> 15:32.160
Oh. I'm so embarrassed.

15:32.260 --> 15:33.430
Oh, don't be.

15:33.530 --> 15:34.630
-Don't be.
-Hmm.

15:34.730 --> 15:36.030
I don't know.
Just the other day,

15:36.130 --> 15:38.030
I was in Bakersfield,
and now I'm in Denver.

15:38.130 --> 15:39.300
And I'm with the Carpet King

15:39.400 --> 15:40.700
-and his ex-wife.
-(chuckles)

15:40.800 --> 15:42.470
And the air
is so damn thin here,

15:42.570 --> 15:44.110
-I can hardly think.
-(laughs)

15:44.210 --> 15:45.710
(both chuckle)

15:45.810 --> 15:47.180
To think,
I was gonna spray you

15:47.280 --> 15:48.840
-with my pepper spray.
-(chuckles)

15:48.940 --> 15:51.210
(chuckles) Well, listen,
I'm glad we cleared that up.

15:51.310 --> 15:54.780
Well, I probably would have
ended up spraying myself.

15:54.880 --> 15:57.620
This, this meat could have used
some more pepper.

15:57.720 --> 15:59.490
(both laugh)

15:59.590 --> 16:01.490
-You don't like the place?
-There's no seasoning.

16:01.590 --> 16:05.190
-Well, it's Denver.
-Well, it's Denver.

16:05.290 --> 16:08.200
Listen, I'm...
I'm so glad to meet you.

16:08.300 --> 16:11.170
-You really are lovely.
-Thank you, Gloria.

16:11.270 --> 16:14.200
Anyone he's willing
to leave Denver for

16:14.300 --> 16:15.540
has got to be amazing.

16:15.640 --> 16:17.410
He loves it here.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.870
Thank you.

16:19.970 --> 16:22.340
DANIEL (in distance):
Chip?

16:22.440 --> 16:25.080
Hey, Chip?

16:25.180 --> 16:26.710
Oh, hey!

16:26.810 --> 16:28.750
Yes, oh, hi, Reverend Kwon,
how are you, Father?

16:28.850 --> 16:30.990
Things are great. Listen, um,

16:31.090 --> 16:33.090
are we on track for
the talent show tomorrow night?

16:33.190 --> 16:35.090
Yeah. Everything's on track.

16:35.190 --> 16:37.830
And nobody's gonna disturb
the performances whatsoever.

16:37.930 --> 16:39.330
Okay. Chip?

16:39.430 --> 16:41.530
Big news:
we're livestreaming this.

16:41.630 --> 16:43.900
-Oh, I love a livestream.
-(laughs): Yeah!

16:44.000 --> 16:45.400
Listen, I got to get back there.

16:45.500 --> 16:47.370
There's 2,000 kids
tearing a hole

16:47.470 --> 16:49.040
in an assistant youth pastor
as we speak.

16:49.140 --> 16:51.670
Uh, but, uh, I will see you
tomorrow night, okay?

16:51.770 --> 16:54.010
Okay. Thank you, Dad--
uh, Father.

16:54.110 --> 16:56.080
Looks good. Keep it up!

16:56.180 --> 16:58.610
-Oh, that cobbler.
-Right? Um, you're welcome.

16:58.710 --> 17:00.620
(sighs):
Oh, I'll need that recipe.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.520
-(chuckles)
-Well, I'll-I'll be sure
to fax it to you.

17:03.620 --> 17:05.790
-(laughter)
-CHRISTINE: Hey, girls,

17:05.890 --> 17:08.720
what exactly
is a carpet emergency?

17:08.819 --> 17:10.260
Oh, it's the new stain repellent

17:10.359 --> 17:11.859
on this low-pile
industrial carpeting.

17:11.960 --> 17:13.960
You know how they say
that to get the stain up,

17:14.060 --> 17:15.700
you just need to dab
at the carpet?

17:15.800 --> 17:17.800
-Yeah.
-Well, when you dab this one,

17:17.900 --> 17:19.270
it catches on fire.

17:19.369 --> 17:21.770
-Oh. That's not good.
-Right.

17:21.869 --> 17:23.910
-Mm, no. Mm-mm.
-KEN: Well,
I just got off the phone

17:24.010 --> 17:26.410
-with Hank at the distributors.
-MONICA: Oh, don't even...

17:26.510 --> 17:28.440
-Don't say nothing.
-It looks like it's gonna be

17:28.540 --> 17:30.810
a complete product recall.

17:30.910 --> 17:33.080
-(sighing, groaning)
-IVY: There goes my weekends
for the next two months.

17:33.180 --> 17:34.950
-MONICA: Yeah.
-KEN: Christine, I'm sorry,
but it looks like

17:35.050 --> 17:37.950
we're gonna have to be in Denver
a lot longer than I thought.

17:38.050 --> 17:39.820
Oh. Well, yeah.

17:39.920 --> 17:42.060
MONICA:
Oh, well, you know,

17:42.160 --> 17:44.560
this just means that we get
to have you a little bit longer.

17:44.660 --> 17:46.160
-(chuckles)
-Yeah!

17:46.260 --> 17:48.460
Daddy home.

17:48.560 --> 17:52.070
(spray paint cans rattling)

17:52.170 --> 17:54.240
-Dude, go, go, go, go!
-Dude, come on, man! Let's go!

17:58.310 --> 18:00.240
(skateboard scraping)

18:00.340 --> 18:02.480
Hey, guys? Guys?

18:02.580 --> 18:04.110
Look, I'm sorry
to have to do this,

18:04.210 --> 18:06.250
but you're gonna have
to learn a lesson.

18:06.350 --> 18:09.450
There's something called, you
know, personal responsibility,

18:09.550 --> 18:12.190
-and...
-(laughter)
-All right, bro.

18:12.290 --> 18:13.790
(gate creaks)

18:13.890 --> 18:16.590
Okay, who would
like to get stabbed first?

18:16.690 --> 18:18.590
-Knife!
-Get out of here, ya punks!

18:18.690 --> 18:21.100
CHIP:
Dale, Dale, Dale--
Dale, Dale, Dale, Dale! Stop!

18:21.200 --> 18:23.670
-Just let me stab the children!
-Stop. Guys. Dale.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.930
Dale. Come down, please.

18:26.030 --> 18:27.700
-(panting)
-DALE: You boys circumcised?

18:27.800 --> 18:30.040
Or you got those hippy wieners?

18:30.140 --> 18:31.610
-Huh?
-We're sorry.

18:31.710 --> 18:33.380
We know we shouldn't have
broken in here.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.380
We're just bored. Okay?
There's nothing to do.

18:35.480 --> 18:37.450
Okay, I'm sorry, guys.

18:37.550 --> 18:39.810
You okay?

18:39.910 --> 18:42.050
(sighs)
All right, I have an idea.

18:42.150 --> 18:43.390
Oh, God, what is it?

18:48.120 --> 18:50.890
What the hell is this? Oh, Dale.

18:50.990 --> 18:53.300
Ugh, I don't have time
for this tonight.

18:53.400 --> 18:57.170
-(sighs)
-Sorry we have
to stick around, Christine.

18:57.270 --> 18:59.370
Oh, I understand.

18:59.470 --> 19:01.470
It's okay.

19:01.570 --> 19:03.640
Something's bothering you.

19:03.740 --> 19:06.210
-No.
-I swear, we--

19:06.310 --> 19:09.910
I, I will only be here
one, two weeks, tops.

19:10.010 --> 19:11.810
It's not that.

19:11.910 --> 19:14.720
It's just that...

19:14.820 --> 19:16.920
Is it worth it?

19:17.020 --> 19:18.920
Is what worth it?

19:19.020 --> 19:20.920
Moving to Bakersfield.

19:21.020 --> 19:23.430
You've got your family,

19:23.530 --> 19:27.400
you're the Carpet King,
you practically know everybody.

19:27.500 --> 19:31.830
And this city--
I mean, it's magical.

19:31.930 --> 19:33.740
When I drove from the airport,

19:33.840 --> 19:35.940
it looked we were
coming into Oz.

19:36.040 --> 19:40.110
(chuckles): Yeah, Denver is
really a magical city, isn't it?

19:40.210 --> 19:43.280
I mean, that's, uh,
that's what I'm asking you, Ken.

19:43.380 --> 19:46.080
Is it worth it?

19:46.180 --> 19:49.450
Oh, Christine.

19:49.550 --> 19:53.790
You are worth that and more.

19:53.890 --> 19:57.730
-(sighs)
-Thank you.

19:57.830 --> 20:02.430
I think I saw Dale with a kn...
a knife or... Oh.

20:02.530 --> 20:05.600
Oh, yeah. Never mind.
I don't know.

20:05.700 --> 20:07.470
I don't know what I saw.

20:07.570 --> 20:09.470
(both chuckle)

20:09.570 --> 20:11.940
Oh, the Internet.

20:23.290 --> 20:24.450
(laughter)

20:24.550 --> 20:26.050
-Look at this. Not bad.
-BOYS: Yeah!

20:26.150 --> 20:27.390
Soon, I'll be doing
one of those--

20:27.490 --> 20:29.060
what are they called? Half-pipe?

20:29.160 --> 20:30.560
-(laughter)
-This is a lot of good fun.

20:30.660 --> 20:32.390
I'll get the hang of it.

20:32.490 --> 20:33.900
-Oh... (chuckles)
-Hey.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.330
-What?
-Dale, can I just...

20:35.430 --> 20:36.930
Guys, I just wanted
to say, uh...

20:37.030 --> 20:39.670
it's a pleasure
to know you, and uh,

20:39.770 --> 20:43.270
good luck in your adult lives,
and, uh, growing up to be men.

20:43.370 --> 20:45.470
-DALE: Hear, hear.
-BOYS: Cheers.

20:45.570 --> 20:47.840
DANIEL:
Keenan! Gerran! Esteban! Wha...

20:47.940 --> 20:49.580
What are you doing?

20:49.680 --> 20:51.110
Do you know how many people
are looking for you?

20:51.210 --> 20:54.180
You get back to the hotel
right now!

20:54.280 --> 20:57.520
Right now!
I am calling your mothers!

20:57.620 --> 20:59.350
DALE:
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
(chuckles)

20:59.450 --> 21:00.920
You know those guys?

21:01.020 --> 21:02.020
They're from "You Alive."

21:02.120 --> 21:04.130
The-the conference?

21:04.230 --> 21:06.630
-They're my kids.
-Those are the kids
from "You Alive"?

21:06.730 --> 21:08.430
The-The youth conference thing?

21:08.530 --> 21:11.170
They are 15 years old. 15.

21:11.270 --> 21:14.470
15? Chip, you didn't tell me

21:14.570 --> 21:16.500
-they were 15.
-I-- I-I-I didn't...

21:16.600 --> 21:18.670
I thought one of them looked
old enough to be a doctor.

21:18.770 --> 21:20.880
You guys are partying
with minors.

21:20.980 --> 21:23.350
That is a Class A felony.

21:23.450 --> 21:25.680
Well, they were tagging up
the-the stadium.

21:25.780 --> 21:26.850
-Tagging up your place?
-I mean...

21:26.950 --> 21:28.280
(stammering)
What do you want me-- I mean,

21:28.380 --> 21:29.950
I just I was trying
to compromise with them.

21:30.050 --> 21:32.050
I was trying to show them that,
you know,

21:32.150 --> 21:34.660
-I was willing to work with...
-DANIEL: Chip.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.860
You have to grow up.

21:36.960 --> 21:38.630
You have to--
You have to act your age.

21:38.730 --> 21:41.360
-Okay?
-(stammering) Sorry, I...

21:41.460 --> 21:44.200
You have to get it together.

21:44.300 --> 21:46.500
(Dale laughs)

21:46.600 --> 21:48.200
(blows raspberries)

21:48.300 --> 21:50.510
Thank you, Rev!

21:50.610 --> 21:52.340
"You got to get it together!"

21:52.440 --> 21:54.480
Well, he sounds like a lot
of people in your life.

21:54.580 --> 21:56.210
(chuckles) Doesn't he?

21:56.310 --> 21:58.810
Oh, my God, you just got told
off by an Asian preacher.

21:58.910 --> 22:01.550
I've heard about everything now.

22:01.650 --> 22:03.220
(laughs, sighs)

22:03.320 --> 22:04.590
Dale, I'm sorry for dragging you
into this.

22:04.690 --> 22:06.320
I-I didn't know that...

22:06.420 --> 22:08.390
Oh, don't worry about it,
I'm having a blast.

22:08.490 --> 22:11.060
Really?

22:11.160 --> 22:13.060
That was a bad judgment call
on my end.

22:13.160 --> 22:14.930
I-I-I-I-I don't know what
I was thinking.

22:15.030 --> 22:17.900
Well, you were pretty good with
those kids. You were, you know?

22:18.000 --> 22:21.340
You're coming around, old boy.
(chuckles)

22:21.440 --> 22:24.340
(takes deep breath)
You're a good CEO.

22:24.440 --> 22:25.770
Thank you, Dale.

22:25.870 --> 22:27.240
Hey, can you toss me
another beer?

22:27.340 --> 22:29.040
Yeah. You need another one
of these.

22:29.140 --> 22:32.080
This will take a load off.

22:32.180 --> 22:33.580
(chuckles) You suck.

22:33.680 --> 22:35.250
You should have caught that,
that was right to you.

22:35.350 --> 22:36.250
CHIP:
I'll get it.

22:42.190 --> 22:44.230
You really think I'm a good CEO?

22:44.330 --> 22:46.260
Sure, you're a great CEO.
I mean, I don't know

22:46.360 --> 22:47.930
-what it means, but...
-Thanks, Dale.

22:48.030 --> 22:49.700
D'oh. (grunts)

22:52.030 --> 22:54.600
I can't drive you
to the hospital, Chip.

22:54.700 --> 22:56.540
I'm too wasted.

22:56.640 --> 22:58.270
Hey, Pastor Dan!

22:58.370 --> 23:00.270
