WEBVTT

00:11.762 --> 00:13.627
Uh, I-I need help.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.671
- I, um-- I need to talk to somebody. I--
- I know my rights.

00:15.724 --> 00:17.134
Somebody shut that guy up.

00:17.142 --> 00:19.474
Uh, no, he's got
my daughter's cellphone.

00:19.478 --> 00:20.638
- Ma'am.
- He's got my daughter's cellphone,

00:20.687 --> 00:21.767
and he's taken her somewhere.

00:21.813 --> 00:23.019
You are gonna need
to slow down.

00:23.065 --> 00:24.430
Okay, Joe Mills.
Joe-- Joe Mills.

00:24.483 --> 00:25.689
You guys are looking for him.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.270
- He's the--
- Okay. Grab a seat, okay?

00:27.319 --> 00:29.105
Somebody will be out
to take your statement.

00:29.154 --> 00:30.314
Okay, no, no.

00:30.322 --> 00:33.610
I got a card, okay?
I got a card. Um...

00:33.659 --> 00:36.947
Um, uh, the-- the--
the Detective-- she gave me a card,

00:36.995 --> 00:38.201
and she told me to call her

00:38.288 --> 00:40.028
- ifI had anything--
- Ma'am.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.325
No, Sarah Linden.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.410
- Ma'am!
- No, Sarah--

00:42.417 --> 00:44.123
Are you under the influence
of alcohol

00:44.127 --> 00:45.788
or any other substances
this evening?

00:45.837 --> 00:48.453
W-what? No, no.
What?

00:48.465 --> 00:50.126
I
Am I-- no, no, you re--

00:50.175 --> 00:52.791
if you can just let me talk
to Sarah Linden, she knows me.

00:52.844 --> 00:54.175
- She knows me. Just get her.
- Christ, lady.

00:54.221 --> 00:55.757
Just get Sarah Linden--
Detective Sarah Linden.

00:55.889 --> 00:56.753
- Listen to me.
- Please just--

00:56.807 --> 00:58.092
I'm trying to be nice here,

00:58.141 --> 00:59.517
but my bullshit needs have
already been met tonight.

00:59.518 --> 01:00.803
So you are gonna need
to sit down,

01:00.852 --> 01:02.683
as instructed, all right?

01:02.729 --> 01:04.344
He took my daughter!

01:04.439 --> 01:05.724
I want to talk to Sarah Linden!

01:05.774 --> 01:06.980
Sarah Linden!

01:07.025 --> 01:09.016
Let me talk to Sarah Linden
right now!

01:09.069 --> 01:12.687
Give me-- No, get off of me!
Sarah Linden!

01:47.316 --> 01:49.807
H-he was quiet

01:49.860 --> 01:53.273
the whole ride there...

01:53.322 --> 01:56.439
till we parked,
and then he, um--

01:56.491 --> 01:59.619
he-- he tells me
to get in the back.

01:59.661 --> 02:04.496
And that's where they like
to do it sometimes, you know?

02:04.541 --> 02:07.203
But he didn't get
in the backseat with me.

02:07.210 --> 02:10.373
He stayed up front.

02:10.422 --> 02:11.787
I thought--

02:11.840 --> 02:13.876
I thought he was
one of those guys

02:13.925 --> 02:16.758
who likes to watch, but...

02:16.762 --> 02:19.219
he just wanted to talk.

02:19.264 --> 02:20.765
About what?

02:20.807 --> 02:24.265
Uh, he said that he'd save me.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.598
What did he mean,
he'd save you?

02:27.648 --> 02:31.106
That 1--
I'd finally see.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.937
See what?

02:32.986 --> 02:36.023
That's when he got
in the back of the car,

02:36.031 --> 02:40.616
and-- and--
a-and I-I asked him

02:40.661 --> 02:45.872
why am I sitting on, uh--
on plastic,

02:45.916 --> 02:48.703
but, uh, he was so fast.

02:48.752 --> 02:51.084
- He was so fast.
- Stay with me, Angie.

02:51.088 --> 02:54.672
I-I-- I couldn't--
I didn't see.

02:54.716 --> 02:57.298
I-- I didn't see.

02:57.302 --> 02:58.803
Angie.

02:58.804 --> 03:00.544
Angie, just look at me.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.133
Look at me.

03:02.182 --> 03:05.891
Breathe.

03:05.936 --> 03:08.518
It's okay.

03:08.522 --> 03:11.855
Okay?

03:11.900 --> 03:13.265
I got you.

03:17.155 --> 03:20.488
Do you recognize
any of these men?

03:20.492 --> 03:23.984
I told you I don't.

03:24.037 --> 03:27.450
No, 1-1 think these--

03:27.457 --> 03:30.665
th-these guys, they're d--
they're different.

03:30.711 --> 03:33.453
It's a six-minute drive
to the park.

03:33.505 --> 03:37.214
Six minutes.
Now think, Angie.

03:37.259 --> 03:40.376
I-I told you
I-I couldn't see,

03:40.429 --> 03:42.044
because it was really dark.

03:42.097 --> 03:43.928
- Just look at it again, okay?
- I couldn't really see his face.

03:43.974 --> 03:45.555
How can you be sure it's not
one of these guys?

03:45.600 --> 03:47.136
- Linden.
- I couldn't see his face.

03:47.185 --> 03:50.973
- Just-- just look again.
- No, I already did!

03:52.899 --> 03:54.890
How can you be sure?

03:54.943 --> 03:56.808
How can you be sure
it's not one of them?

03:56.862 --> 04:00.354
Because I 5--
he looked at me.

04:02.617 --> 04:05.825
I know his eyes.

04:05.871 --> 04:08.157
I saw his eyes
in the rear view,

04:08.206 --> 04:12.996
looking at me like--
like I wasn't even there.

04:14.171 --> 04:16.162
I think you're gonna need
to leave now.

04:16.214 --> 04:18.500
Ijust-- save the speech.
We're leaving.

04:18.550 --> 04:22.088
Everything's gonna be okay, An.

04:22.137 --> 04:24.423
H-he got the left one.

04:24.473 --> 04:29.718
What if someone
wants to marry me?

04:29.728 --> 04:31.844
D-do you think it matters?

04:34.900 --> 04:36.310
No.

04:40.739 --> 04:41.979
What the hell, Linden?

04:42.032 --> 04:43.568
What the hell are you doing?

04:45.243 --> 04:47.029
If you keep that up,
anything she says

04:47.037 --> 04:50.120
is gonna be inadmissible.

04:50.207 --> 04:51.538
Get the sketch artist here.

04:51.583 --> 04:54.040
I want him in the room
as soon as she wakes up,

04:54.044 --> 04:55.159
getting the ID.

04:55.212 --> 04:56.702
What ID?
There's no ID.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.204
Girl looked straight at Mills,
didn't bat an eye.

04:59.257 --> 05:00.713
That doesn't mean anything.

05:00.717 --> 05:03.174
- You think she's lying?
- I think maybe she's scared.

05:03.220 --> 05:06.053
These girls don't trust anybody,
let alone cops.

05:06.097 --> 05:09.225
Skinner's got every badge out
gunning for Mills.

05:09.267 --> 05:11.258
Everybody thinks
he's good for it,

05:11.269 --> 05:13.931
except for the girl
who actually saw the killer.

05:13.980 --> 05:16.437
That doesn't bother you?

05:18.318 --> 05:19.933
Do you think we're chasing
the wrong guy?

05:19.945 --> 05:21.230
Let me ask you this.

05:21.279 --> 05:23.486
If it's the same guy
that's cutting up these girls

05:23.532 --> 05:25.739
that de-capped Trisha Seward
three years ago,

05:25.784 --> 05:28.571
then how come we got no connection
between Mills and Seward?

05:31.248 --> 05:33.455
Detective Linden.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.039
Mrs. Linden.

05:35.085 --> 05:36.700
Skinner thought
you could use some help.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.254
Great. Let us know
when it gets here.

05:38.255 --> 05:39.711
Oh, she's funny.

05:39.756 --> 05:41.963
When did that happen?

05:42.008 --> 05:43.589
I have to take this.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.208
Hurry back.

05:45.262 --> 05:46.297
Linden.

05:46.304 --> 05:47.339
Geez, lighten up.

05:47.430 --> 05:49.261
You didn't used to be
so serious...

05:49.307 --> 05:50.808
or so homeless.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.934
What's with the snuggie?
You have a fire or something?

05:53.979 --> 05:55.719
You have a talk
with the vet tech yet?

05:55.772 --> 05:56.887
Homeboy swears up and down

05:56.940 --> 05:58.646
he doesn't know
who brought Angie in.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.148
You buying that?

06:00.151 --> 06:01.140
No reason not to.

06:01.152 --> 06:02.437
Clinic's a dead drop--

06:02.445 --> 06:04.106
gangbanger off the books ER.

06:04.155 --> 06:05.656
Doorbell keeps it anonymous.

06:05.657 --> 06:07.693
Body comes in,
cash goes on the counter.

06:07.742 --> 06:11.280
Whoever brought the body in
hits the bell on the way out.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.661
Vet tech waits a few,
and then...

06:13.707 --> 06:14.867
What about Mills?

06:14.958 --> 06:16.619
Still looking for his cab.

06:16.668 --> 06:18.533
Switchboard's getting lit up

06:18.587 --> 06:20.543
with bad IDs and psych cases.

06:20.589 --> 06:22.625
Unis kicked down
a door in Alki,

06:22.674 --> 06:24.630
almost capped a music teacher.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.295
What did, uh,

06:26.344 --> 06:29.177
four-fifths of a hand job
have to say?

06:29.222 --> 06:31.087
She finger Mills?

06:31.141 --> 06:32.847
She at least knuckle him?

06:35.520 --> 06:37.852
There he is.
That's my partner.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.514
Oh, you're bad.
That's real bad.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.899
Get me a room.
I'm on my way.

06:44.279 --> 06:46.270
Danette Leeds
got herself arrested.

06:46.323 --> 06:47.733
So?

06:47.782 --> 06:49.989
Stay here with Angie.
Get a description.

06:50.035 --> 06:52.151
See if you can get
a sketch artist in.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.527
You want me to come with you?

06:53.580 --> 06:54.740
No. I'm fine.

06:58.209 --> 07:00.245
Looks like you're sleeping
on the couch.

07:00.295 --> 07:02.377
I need a coffee to go
with this. You?

07:02.422 --> 07:04.003
- I'm buying.
- No, I'm good.

07:06.384 --> 07:07.715
Yo, vintage playa.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.797
You got a smoke?

07:12.724 --> 07:15.761
Don't mind ifI do.
Thank you, sir.

07:23.234 --> 07:24.815
You can uncuff her.

07:24.861 --> 07:27.898
Did you find him?

07:27.906 --> 07:29.362
No, not yet.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.655
Yeah, well,
I tried to tell them,

07:30.700 --> 07:31.906
but they wouldn't listen to me.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.112
Joe's up there.

07:33.203 --> 07:36.286
Joe Mills, room 106.
You look at room 106?

07:36.289 --> 07:39.577
I barely got out of there
with my life. He's crazy.

07:39.668 --> 07:41.954
- He's gone.
- What?

07:42.003 --> 07:43.914
Well, what about
his mother's place?

07:43.964 --> 07:45.545
You check there?

07:53.515 --> 07:54.595
We will find him.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.222
And if Kallie's
with him--

07:56.267 --> 07:58.178
If? What are you
talking about, if?

07:58.228 --> 07:59.889
He had her phone.
He had Kallie's phone.

07:59.938 --> 08:02.270
- She would never go anywhere without--
- Lower your voice.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.725
Do you think
I'm making this up?

08:03.775 --> 08:05.811
This is my daughter out there,
God knows where.

08:05.860 --> 08:08.237
She-- look, she's probably
in some basement somewhere,

08:08.279 --> 08:09.735
but she's alive,
and she's call--

08:13.243 --> 08:14.949
It's a shame you didn't think

08:14.995 --> 08:17.111
of giving us
this information sooner.

08:17.163 --> 08:20.451
Why are you just sitting there?

08:20.500 --> 08:23.162
You should be out there,
looking for her.

08:23.211 --> 08:24.542
We're sitting here

08:24.587 --> 08:27.454
because when I asked you
where Joe Mills was, you lied.

08:34.014 --> 08:37.051
You won't be charged.

08:37.100 --> 08:40.012
But it'll take a while
to process you out.

08:40.061 --> 08:42.848
Any idea where Joe
would go next?

08:45.692 --> 08:49.776
It was always just me and her.

08:49.821 --> 08:53.439
You have no idea what it's like
to have a kid

08:53.450 --> 08:57.193
and be alone and have
everything riding on you.

09:04.794 --> 09:07.786
I gave her this shirt
for her birthday.

09:07.839 --> 09:09.670
She didn't like it too much.

09:09.716 --> 09:12.298
She said it looked
like an old-lady shirt.

09:18.016 --> 09:22.806
When she was a little girl,
she was so small, just so...

09:22.854 --> 09:26.096
She used to just fit
right here.

09:28.443 --> 09:29.899
When I'd take her to the river,

09:29.944 --> 09:33.186
she'd only go in ifI held her.

09:33.239 --> 09:36.902
She was scared, and so I'd
just hold her right here,

09:36.993 --> 09:38.733
and we'd wade together.

09:38.745 --> 09:44.331
I think it was the sound
of the water that scared her.

09:44.334 --> 09:47.497
But I'd say to her,

09:47.504 --> 09:50.792
"Just cover your ears, baby.
Just cover your ears."

09:52.717 --> 09:57.882
But she'd just...
hold on to me like...

10:03.895 --> 10:06.932
And then one day, she just--
she didn't say nothing.

10:06.981 --> 10:08.391
She just stood right up,

10:08.441 --> 10:10.557
and she walked right over
to the water,

10:10.568 --> 10:11.978
and she walked right in.

10:15.490 --> 10:17.981
But she came back.
She always came back.

10:18.034 --> 10:21.276
She runs off all the time,
but she always comes back.

10:24.124 --> 10:27.241
She's out there,
and Joe's got her.

10:27.335 --> 10:30.202
You find her.
Find my little girl.

10:30.255 --> 10:33.247
Please. Please.

10:47.438 --> 10:50.054
What are you doing?

11:06.958 --> 11:10.325
Becker'll be by any minute
for cell check.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.585
He catches you messing
with the property,

11:12.630 --> 11:14.541
he's gonna beat your ass again.

11:14.591 --> 11:15.956
Not tonight.

11:15.967 --> 11:19.505
They already missed
5:00 AM.

11:19.554 --> 11:22.045
They missed 4:30.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.009
And they missed 4:00.

11:36.905 --> 11:37.940
Alton.

11:40.366 --> 11:43.654
You need to think clearly
right now.

11:44.913 --> 11:47.074
What you think
I been doing, Ray?

11:50.126 --> 11:54.335
Thinking is all I do.

11:54.339 --> 11:56.921
Thinking is all I got left.

11:56.966 --> 12:01.084
I been thinking, Ray.

12:04.098 --> 12:06.714
Come on out
where I can see you.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.681
Been here for three years, Ray.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.564
For the first time tonight,

12:19.572 --> 12:22.780
I woke up and didn't know
where I was.

12:22.825 --> 12:27.285
Honest to God, I had no idea.

12:35.713 --> 12:38.455
They only coming
if you call them.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.187
Alton.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.575
There.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.914
That's the hard part.

13:24.679 --> 13:27.011
You did good.
Hard part's over.

13:30.643 --> 13:34.056
N-now just let it go, kid.

13:37.317 --> 13:40.559
It's nothing worth
holding on to.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.046
Late.

14:02.091 --> 14:04.503
I know. Sorry.
Baby was teething.

14:04.552 --> 14:06.668
Relax.
Becker's not here.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.385
Where is he?

14:08.431 --> 14:10.467
Said he had to take care
of something, so he left.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.677
So who's on the block?

14:12.727 --> 14:14.809
You are, Supernanny.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.596
Wake them up.

14:19.609 --> 14:21.691
0600, gentlemen.
Rise and shine.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.936
Roll call in 15.
Let's go.

14:24.989 --> 14:27.446
Up, up, up.

14:27.492 --> 14:28.857
Hey.

14:28.910 --> 14:30.571
Come on, let's go.
Up, up.

14:34.665 --> 14:36.451
You're up early.

14:43.633 --> 14:46.170
This is Baker 04.
I got a Code Six.

14:46.219 --> 14:49.586
Request med assist, C-block, cell 209.

14:49.639 --> 14:52.221
Copy, 04 Baker.
Be advised, CERT team inbound.

14:57.438 --> 14:58.769
Let's go.
Open it up!

14:58.815 --> 15:00.851
Prepare for lockdown!

15:00.900 --> 15:02.982
Let's go! Go!

15:06.739 --> 15:07.899
Our victim

15:07.907 --> 15:10.114
hasn't positively ID'd
Joe Mills yet.

15:10.159 --> 15:11.945
We'll go back to the hospital
in a couple of hours,

15:12.036 --> 15:13.196
have another talk.

15:13.204 --> 15:14.740
She saw the guy.
She's got to give us something.

15:14.789 --> 15:15.869
What about the motel?

15:15.915 --> 15:17.906
We combed every inch
of that flea bag.

15:17.959 --> 15:20.701
No witnesses saw him come
in or out, paid in cash.

15:20.753 --> 15:21.959
Maybe he fled in his cab.

15:22.004 --> 15:24.211
He'll have to use a credit card
at some point.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.464
Yeah, and we're not getting hits
on either.

15:26.509 --> 15:28.295
And Mills hasn't crossed
the border,

15:28.344 --> 15:30.335
so either he's holed up
somewhere, dead,

15:30.388 --> 15:31.753
or the guy's a damn ghost.

15:38.729 --> 15:41.311
What part of this is hard
for you to understand?

15:41.357 --> 15:44.770
I'm talking about the welfare
of a child here.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.768
Adrian has made
tremendous progress

15:46.821 --> 15:48.357
since coming to live with us.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.530
I will not have that
jeopardized by you.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.865
All right, let me just stop you
there for a second.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.650
Look, Detective Linden
was wrong

15:54.704 --> 15:56.911
talking to the boy
without your permission.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.163
She came to his school,
for God's sakes!

15:59.167 --> 16:03.251
And it won't happen again.
I guarantee it.

16:05.256 --> 16:07.668
I'm sorry to have put Adrian
in that situation.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.753
You told him
he could see his father.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.793
Look, the thing is,

16:11.846 --> 16:15.213
you talking to him
has set Adrian off.

16:15.266 --> 16:16.255
He's regressed a little,

16:16.309 --> 16:19.551
and he's sleeping
in the closet again.

16:19.604 --> 16:22.971
Again?
What do you mean?

16:23.024 --> 16:25.356
He won't sleep in his bed.

16:25.443 --> 16:28.776
Every morning, we find him
curled up in his closet.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.654
It took us months to break him
of that behavior.

16:31.699 --> 16:35.362
You have no idea
what a setback that is.

16:35.453 --> 16:37.034
Was he sleeping in the closet

16:37.038 --> 16:38.994
when he first came
to live with you?

16:39.040 --> 16:42.658
The social workers said
he's been doing it for years,

16:42.710 --> 16:44.792
- even when he lived with his mother.
- Excuse me.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.043
Where are you going?

16:46.088 --> 16:47.828
- W-where is she going?
- Sarah.

16:47.882 --> 16:50.089
I'm sorry. I am.

16:50.134 --> 16:52.841
I'm sorry to have upset
your son. It won't happen again.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.341
So, Adrian's foster parents

16:56.349 --> 16:58.340
said that he's been sleeping
in the closet--

16:58.351 --> 16:59.761
an old behavior of his.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.186
He was doing it
when he got to them.

17:01.229 --> 17:02.594
W-what are we doing here?

17:02.647 --> 17:04.057
Unless you got a body
back there--

17:04.106 --> 17:05.767
You got somewhere else to be?

17:05.816 --> 17:07.067
Joe Mills is in the wind.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.020
You want to go back
to the hospital

17:09.070 --> 17:10.810
and babysit Angie with Reddick,

17:10.863 --> 17:12.899
be my guest.

17:14.825 --> 17:18.659
Oh, no way. Wow.

17:18.663 --> 17:21.325
So, when you said
the Seward file was in storage,

17:21.332 --> 17:22.913
you meant your backseat.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.285
- That's great.
- Oh, wait, let me--

17:24.335 --> 17:25.165
Yo, don't get handsy.

17:25.169 --> 17:26.705
I got a girlfriend, okay?

17:26.754 --> 17:28.745
That one there--
Adrian's bedroom.

17:32.802 --> 17:34.463
We always assumed
Adrian was in his bed

17:34.512 --> 17:36.002
the night his mom was murdered.

17:38.015 --> 17:40.472
Look. His bed was made.

17:40.518 --> 17:42.725
So you're saying if he wasn't
sleeping in his bed--

17:42.770 --> 17:44.226
He was sleeping in the closet.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.516
Yeah, but there's no closet
in his bedroom.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.813
Damn.

17:56.951 --> 17:58.862
We need to go back there.

18:02.957 --> 18:07.075
Just want to point out
this is a Class-A felony.

18:07.128 --> 18:09.744
Easy, yo. That knife cost me
a 50-spot.

18:09.797 --> 18:12.038
It's defective.

18:12.049 --> 18:16.133
Yeah, so, I was thinking,

18:16.178 --> 18:17.759
I mean, it's the same
with all these girls.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.719
Like, either they're not seeing,
or they're not saying.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.426
So?

18:21.434 --> 18:25.347
So maybe we're looking
at this whole thing inside-out.

18:25.396 --> 18:28.763
It's not about what
these girls see.

18:28.816 --> 18:32.434
It's about what he sees.

18:32.486 --> 18:35.444
What's he looking for?

18:35.448 --> 18:38.781
How does he choose?

18:38.784 --> 18:40.991
See, we've been going at it
all Copernicus,

18:41.078 --> 18:43.740
when we need to be Galileo
on this bitch, you feel me?

18:43.789 --> 18:46.496
See, Copernicus, he was,
you know, like,

18:46.584 --> 18:50.202
looking at the Sun doing its
thing from this middle place,

18:50.254 --> 18:51.755
like he was the middle.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.755
But then Galileo was all like,
"Nah, man, that's conceited."

18:54.759 --> 18:57.296
And then Copernicus started
fronting, like-- what?

18:57.345 --> 18:59.210
What's wrong with your face,
Linden?

18:59.263 --> 19:00.469
Don't stroke out on me.

19:00.473 --> 19:05.342
You know, hire-backs
ain't on the health plan.

19:05.436 --> 19:07.142
There we go.

19:19.450 --> 19:22.487
No one's lived here
since the murder.

19:28.959 --> 19:32.543
Mayor Richmond's waterfront.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.920
Eminent domain.

19:34.965 --> 19:38.457
We found
Trisha Seward's body here.

19:47.269 --> 19:50.978
And I found Adrian
hiding there...

19:51.023 --> 19:52.524
in that closet.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.094
And what are we
doing now, Linden?

20:24.140 --> 20:25.676
We playing hide and seek?

20:39.155 --> 20:41.612
Sta rs.

20:41.657 --> 20:46.697
He put stars on the ceiling...

20:46.704 --> 20:48.535
because he slept here.

21:01.427 --> 21:04.760
Go to the front door.
Step into the hallway.

21:11.312 --> 21:12.848
Now walk in.

21:16.650 --> 21:18.265
Stop.

21:36.504 --> 21:39.746
If Adrian was sleeping here
that night,

21:39.799 --> 21:42.131
he saw the killer.

21:49.183 --> 21:51.799
I'm telling you, there is
a direct view from the closet

21:51.852 --> 21:54.309
to the exact spot
Trisha Seward was killed.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.305
How long are they
gonna run this crap, huh?

21:57.358 --> 21:58.973
Hey.

21:58.984 --> 22:01.191
Adrian saw the killer.

22:01.237 --> 22:02.693
Did he, now?

22:02.738 --> 22:04.444
Funny he never mentioned it
three years ago

22:04.490 --> 22:06.105
when we talked to him
for five--

22:06.158 --> 22:09.946
or was it six hours?

22:09.995 --> 22:12.202
He's remembering.
We have a new drawing.

22:12.248 --> 22:13.078
Oh, yeah?

22:13.123 --> 22:14.454
Tell me something, Sarah.

22:14.500 --> 22:17.663
Did he tell you what he saw

22:17.670 --> 22:20.412
when you visited him
on the school playground?

22:20.422 --> 22:22.458
No, I need
to speak to him again.

22:28.514 --> 22:30.630
All right, in my office.

22:35.145 --> 22:36.521
Excuse us, Detective.

22:36.522 --> 22:38.638
What, you want me to...

22:40.234 --> 22:43.192
You know what?

22:43.237 --> 22:44.727
This is what I want.

22:45.072 --> 22:47.404
I want you out on the street,

22:47.449 --> 22:50.031
acting like you're
an actual murder cop.

22:50.119 --> 22:51.359
Yeah, I want you down there,

22:51.370 --> 22:52.826
looking around,
creeping around,

22:52.872 --> 22:55.454
doing whatever shady thing
it is that you do,

22:55.499 --> 22:58.411
and seeing, for once,
if somebody could put

22:58.460 --> 23:01.452
an actual eyeball
on this Joe Mills scumbag!

23:01.463 --> 23:03.203
That's what I want.

23:12.600 --> 23:13.931
Sarah, we both know

23:13.976 --> 23:17.434
talking to Adrian
is not gonna happen,

23:17.438 --> 23:20.054
not after this morning.

23:22.776 --> 23:24.607
What about Seward?

23:24.653 --> 23:26.268
Yeah, well, if you want to go
back to that prison,

23:26.322 --> 23:27.402
you don't need my permission.

23:27.448 --> 23:29.484
No, I'm not asking you
for permission.

23:29.533 --> 23:31.273
This is our case.

23:31.285 --> 23:33.742
- We are both responsible if that man--
- What?

23:33.787 --> 23:34.617
If what, Sarah?

23:37.124 --> 23:38.284
You know, you asked me
for some time

23:38.334 --> 23:39.574
on this Seward thing,
and I gave it to you.

23:39.585 --> 23:41.325
I indulged your theory.

23:41.420 --> 23:44.537
But if we're gonna be
honest here,

23:44.590 --> 23:45.750
you're exactly where we started
with this.

23:45.799 --> 23:47.050
That is not true.

23:47.092 --> 23:48.298
You have nothing connecting

23:48.385 --> 23:49.545
- Trisha Seward's murder to these girls.
- What?

23:49.595 --> 23:51.085
It's the same wound,
it's the same weapon type,

23:51.138 --> 23:55.472
- it is the same trophy-taking behavior!
- That is not enough!

24:04.610 --> 24:07.477
This job is not
for human beings.

24:07.529 --> 24:10.271
I mean, you do it right,
it eats your life.

24:10.324 --> 24:11.985
But sometimes,
you got to step back,

24:11.992 --> 24:14.825
and you got to ask yourself,

24:14.828 --> 24:17.444
"Am I too close?"

24:19.583 --> 24:22.245
I'm fine.

24:26.131 --> 24:30.591
It was three years ago,
and I dealt with it.

24:32.513 --> 24:35.095
If it's a doctor's permission
you need,

24:35.099 --> 24:36.305
that could
probably be arranged.

24:36.350 --> 24:37.840
Hey. I was there,
you know.

24:37.935 --> 24:39.971
Don't treat me like I wasn't.

24:40.020 --> 24:43.308
It didn't just happen to you.

24:43.357 --> 24:46.849
Listen, you're a good cop.

24:46.902 --> 24:48.858
You got instincts.

24:48.904 --> 24:50.235
But there's a difference

24:50.280 --> 24:52.566
between following your instincts
and an obsession.

24:52.616 --> 24:54.857
I'm following evidence.

24:54.868 --> 24:56.654
I'm following evidence.

25:01.709 --> 25:04.416
The killer is active now
because it's the same killer.

25:04.420 --> 25:08.083
Jimmy, it's the same case.

25:10.676 --> 25:13.133
I need you on Joe Mills.
Is that clear?

25:22.312 --> 25:24.598
Where was Becker last night?

25:26.692 --> 25:28.899
Why do you care?

25:30.904 --> 25:34.522
He hasn't been around today.

25:34.575 --> 25:39.444
I assume he's on suspension,
pending an investigation.

25:39.455 --> 25:42.367
You could've called out.

25:42.416 --> 25:45.829
You could've done something
for him.

25:45.878 --> 25:49.962
Alton was your friend.
He liked you, Ray.

25:52.217 --> 25:53.832
Why didn't you help him?

25:53.886 --> 25:55.046
Idid.

25:57.681 --> 26:00.093
I want a visitation.

26:13.197 --> 26:14.687
...such a big deal
out of it, Lyric.

26:14.740 --> 26:15.855
Step off.

26:15.908 --> 26:17.614
Yeah, look, we're just talking.

26:17.659 --> 26:20.116
Hey,uh”.

26:20.120 --> 26:21.951
Can-- I need
to talk to you.

26:21.955 --> 26:23.456
Can you just stop
for a second, please?

26:24.833 --> 26:25.913
Are you gonna cry?

26:25.959 --> 26:28.120
- I'm working right now.
- You can't go.

26:28.170 --> 26:29.831
- Is she gonna cry?
- Is she really gonna cry?

26:29.880 --> 26:31.290
- Hey!
- Run to mommy.

26:35.803 --> 26:38.215
Hey,uh”.

26:38.222 --> 26:41.965
Trigger, uh, have you seen
Kallie around?

26:42.059 --> 26:43.845
It's Bullet.

26:43.894 --> 26:46.101
Right. Uh, sorry.

26:46.146 --> 26:49.638
Um, it's just she hasn't been
around for a while,

26:49.691 --> 26:51.602
and I...

26:51.652 --> 26:54.985
I haven't seen her.

26:54.988 --> 26:56.319
Well, if you do,

26:56.365 --> 26:59.482
can you just tell her
that I was looking

26:59.493 --> 27:02.280
and that she should come home?

27:05.249 --> 27:06.329
You're her friend, right?

27:08.961 --> 27:10.201
What?

27:10.254 --> 27:12.620
I'm, like, driving around,

27:12.631 --> 27:14.132
and I don't know--

27:14.174 --> 27:16.790
I don't know
where she might go,

27:16.844 --> 27:21.429
so I was thinking
that maybe you would?

27:29.523 --> 27:31.229
Close eight!

27:39.283 --> 27:40.864
What did I tell you?

27:40.868 --> 27:44.702
Most famous man
in Washington State.

27:46.874 --> 27:48.785
This dick-wit
didn't believe me.

27:59.970 --> 28:01.380
Dad.

28:04.224 --> 28:06.465
I didn't think you'd want
to see me.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.133
Ididn't.

28:11.857 --> 28:14.348
Something happened--
changed my mind.

28:19.865 --> 28:24.609
You got that present
I sent you?

28:24.661 --> 28:26.071
Hmm?

28:26.079 --> 28:30.038
Not easy getting a thing
like that up here, I tell you.

28:30.083 --> 28:33.211
Had to pull in a favor,
you know what I mean?

28:35.047 --> 28:38.414
Figured you'd pass it along
to that prick Becker.

28:38.467 --> 28:42.051
You give him my regards.

28:44.181 --> 28:45.762
You look old.

28:47.434 --> 28:51.677
Well, kind of comes on you
all at once in here.

28:54.524 --> 28:57.732
When you were born, you were
such a puny little shit,

28:57.778 --> 29:00.645
they put you in that incubator
thing for extra long.

29:00.697 --> 29:04.440
Your mother cried all night,
thought you were gonna die.

29:04.451 --> 29:07.943
Not me.
I knew you'd fight.

29:07.996 --> 29:10.612
Know why?
Because you're mine.

29:10.624 --> 29:13.741
My son.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.704
What are you doing?

29:18.757 --> 29:22.045
We starved...

29:22.094 --> 29:24.426
when you left.

29:24.429 --> 29:27.136
You know that?

29:27.140 --> 29:30.974
And you brought me here
to cry about it?

29:31.019 --> 29:32.099
Huh? Why?

29:32.104 --> 29:33.514
You think maybe you're here

29:33.563 --> 29:35.428
because you didn't have
a father, right?

29:35.482 --> 29:38.315
- No role model?
- Who was that supposed to be? You?

29:38.360 --> 29:39.816
Hey, I taught you
a couple of things.

29:39.820 --> 29:43.153
Yeah, like what? How to--
how to drink and steal?

29:43.156 --> 29:44.987
How to leave.

29:45.033 --> 29:46.989
I taught you how to be a man.
Don't you forget that.

29:56.128 --> 29:58.414
This was a bad idea.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.291
I got to go.

30:03.343 --> 30:05.504
Hey. No. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

30:05.512 --> 30:07.013
Sit down. Oh.

30:07.014 --> 30:09.972
No, stay a bit.
Hey, listen.

30:11.977 --> 30:16.346
1--

30:16.398 --> 30:18.639
I'm proud of you.
That's all.

30:18.692 --> 30:19.977
For what?

30:20.027 --> 30:22.689
For doing your time
with your mouth shut.

30:22.738 --> 30:25.070
For going out like a man.

30:25.115 --> 30:28.858
Dying in a jumpsuit
doesn't make you a man.

30:36.918 --> 30:38.499
Open eight!

30:46.845 --> 30:49.882
You and Kallie
used to come here?

30:49.890 --> 30:51.676
Yeah, and up on that bridge.

30:51.725 --> 30:54.262
She used to stare down
at the water.

30:55.270 --> 31:00.435
Said she liked the way
it looked or something.

31:00.442 --> 31:02.899
I used to take her here
when she was a kid.

31:02.903 --> 31:04.609
Yeah. I know.

31:06.990 --> 31:09.823
She said you tried to teach her
how to play hide and seek,

31:09.868 --> 31:11.699
but she could never
figure it out.

31:11.745 --> 31:15.078
No, she never could.

31:15.123 --> 31:17.079
I'd close my eyes
and count to five,

31:17.125 --> 31:18.240
but when I opened them,

31:18.293 --> 31:20.409
she'd be standing
right in front of me.

31:33.725 --> 31:35.101
She'll be all right.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.136
Yeah.

31:56.623 --> 31:59.160
Yeah? What?

31:59.209 --> 32:02.121
Does the name Joe Mills
mean anything to you?

32:06.758 --> 32:07.964
Hmm. Let me guess.

32:07.968 --> 32:10.835
You want me to finger this guy
for something?

32:12.681 --> 32:15.093
Let's say I throw
this dirtbag under the bus.

32:15.142 --> 32:16.222
What's in it for me?

32:16.268 --> 32:19.010
Nothing.

32:23.150 --> 32:27.143
Then I don't know him.

32:27.195 --> 32:28.480
Sorry.

32:34.870 --> 32:36.861
Your son saw the killer.

32:40.167 --> 32:44.706
He was sleeping in the closet
across from the front door.

32:44.754 --> 32:48.246
He did that a lot.

32:48.300 --> 32:51.838
I saw the pasted-on stars
on the ceiling,

32:51.887 --> 32:56.347
the ones that glow,
in kids' bedrooms.

32:56.349 --> 32:57.885
His mother
must have put them there.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.386
I put them there.

33:09.779 --> 33:13.522
He didn't like to sleep
in his bedroom.

33:18.455 --> 33:20.411
Why?

33:29.758 --> 33:31.623
How would I know?

33:34.221 --> 33:37.588
I know you didn't kill
your wife.

33:45.357 --> 33:48.690
I need to talk to Adrian.
I need to know what he saw.

33:48.735 --> 33:51.568
Please, I need your help.

33:58.495 --> 34:02.613
And you came
to this realization, what...

34:02.624 --> 34:06.742
Three years after the fact?!

34:10.966 --> 34:14.299
And just 12 days
before I hang?!

34:16.096 --> 34:19.304
Jesus!

34:19.349 --> 34:20.429
Guard!

34:23.645 --> 34:25.931
Don't come back here.

35:39.888 --> 35:41.753
You all right?

35:46.436 --> 35:49.394
He does this.

35:49.439 --> 35:53.728
I don't know why.

35:53.777 --> 35:57.110
I don't know
why I always let him hurt me.

36:18.551 --> 36:19.882
Want to keep me warm?

36:23.139 --> 36:25.516
I'm freezing.

36:25.558 --> 36:27.264
Aren't you?

36:50.875 --> 36:53.036
What's wrong?

36:53.044 --> 36:55.535
Nothing.

36:55.547 --> 36:57.287
Don't lie.

37:00.135 --> 37:02.376
I know you, B.

37:13.022 --> 37:14.808
I saw Kallie's mom.

37:28.204 --> 37:30.911
You think Kallie's coming back?

37:34.127 --> 37:36.664
Hey, look at me.

37:41.426 --> 37:44.213
You don't have to be tough
all the time, you know?

38:02.697 --> 38:04.107
What?

38:07.452 --> 38:10.990
You think I don't see you.

38:11.039 --> 38:12.575
But I do.

38:59.838 --> 39:02.329
He's out there
on those streets.

39:05.426 --> 39:08.008
Probably driven by him
a hundred times.

39:09.681 --> 39:11.512
Never gonna get him, are we?

39:15.353 --> 39:20.347
It's like he's on a...
crusade, a-a mission.

39:20.441 --> 39:24.184
He's out to save them,
Angie said.

39:25.697 --> 39:29.565
It's not just any girl.

39:29.617 --> 39:32.700
It's the lost ones.

39:32.704 --> 39:37.573
He's the shepherd,
they're his flock.

39:37.625 --> 39:40.913
He puts them in the backseat.

39:40.962 --> 39:44.420
He can see them that way,
in the mirror,

39:44.465 --> 39:48.925
but they can just see
his eyes...

39:50.597 --> 39:53.589
just looking at them...

39:53.641 --> 39:56.974
like a confession.

39:56.978 --> 40:00.266
Theirs or his?

40:00.315 --> 40:03.899
Look, I don't want
to see your useless face

40:03.943 --> 40:07.561
until you get her back,
you understand?!

40:07.614 --> 40:08.899
What's up?

40:08.948 --> 40:12.736
Ah, they took the girl
down to radiology,

40:12.785 --> 40:14.321
didn't come back.

40:14.370 --> 40:17.407
Must have walked
right out the front door.

40:17.457 --> 40:20.824
We had one witness-- one.

40:20.877 --> 40:23.209
Now Angie Gower's gone.

40:23.254 --> 40:25.415
I want her found,

40:25.465 --> 40:28.423
and I want her found tonight.

40:30.929 --> 40:33.796
Come on!

40:33.848 --> 40:36.510
What are we,
the Keystone Kops?!

40:39.520 --> 40:40.896
Beacon Home?

40:40.939 --> 40:43.555
She went there once for help.
Maybe she'll go back.

40:58.915 --> 41:01.122
Did Pastor Mike say
how long he'd be?

41:01.167 --> 41:02.452
Nope.

41:02.502 --> 41:04.663
Let him know we're here
and it's urgent.

41:04.712 --> 41:06.919
He's working
the dinnertime shift right now,

41:06.965 --> 41:08.546
so I can't promise anything.

41:08.591 --> 41:10.127
Yeah, well, we're gonna need
to see him right away,

41:10.176 --> 41:13.339
so just make sure
he gets the message.

41:16.265 --> 41:19.632
The shepherd and his flock?

42:07.817 --> 42:11.560
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
