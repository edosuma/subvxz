This is
"Dude Bro Party Massacre III."

00:58.960 --> 01:00.520
What you doing, buddy?

01:00.520 --> 01:02.490
You mowing the lawn?

01:47.400 --> 01:50.000
D-u-u-ude!

01:50.410 --> 01:53.410
Br-o-o-o-o!

01:53.410 --> 01:57.010
P-a-a-arty!

01:57.010 --> 01:59.280
Massacre!

01:59.280 --> 02:02.280
Three.

02:02.290 --> 02:04.250
Three times this week
you've been in here,

02:04.250 --> 02:07.520
and you've yet to tell me
why you keep saying "massacre."

02:07.520 --> 02:09.060
It was just so painful.

02:09.060 --> 02:10.520
There was so much blood.

02:10.530 --> 02:15.530
Brock... This is a safe place.

02:15.530 --> 02:17.230
I need you to open up.

02:19.500 --> 02:21.570
This is about those
two previous mass murders

02:21.570 --> 02:23.400
on Frat Row, isn't it?

02:23.410 --> 02:25.910
I don't know
if I can talk about that.

02:25.910 --> 02:28.610
It's just... so painful.

02:28.610 --> 02:30.440
Okay. I'll try.

02:30.450 --> 02:32.150
The first party massacre started

02:32.150 --> 02:35.180
with a panty raid gone wrong.

02:35.180 --> 02:38.150
The sorority house mother
was pissed.

02:38.150 --> 02:40.960
No one taught her
how to open doors.

02:40.960 --> 02:42.960
But she learned.

02:42.960 --> 02:45.990
And she was out for revenge.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.260
Oh! Little help, bro?

02:48.260 --> 02:50.500
Wh... Wha... Oh, no!

02:50.500 --> 02:52.400
Road Doggie
was her first victim.

02:52.400 --> 02:54.370
Daddy's bro. Ugh...

02:54.370 --> 02:56.970
Next, she went after Cindy
and C-Trunk.

02:56.970 --> 02:58.110
Oh, C-Trunk.

02:58.110 --> 02:59.510
Oh, C-Trunk!

03:02.180 --> 03:04.650
What's taking you bros
so long to shower?!

03:04.650 --> 03:06.310
But when she killed
Coach Handsey,

03:06.320 --> 03:07.550
- I had to wonder...
- Aah!

03:07.550 --> 03:08.480
...was she on our side?

03:08.480 --> 03:10.020
Good throw.

03:10.020 --> 03:11.150
- She wasn't!
- Aah!

03:11.150 --> 03:12.350
- Whoa!
- Ohh!

03:12.360 --> 03:14.150
She hunted us down!

03:15.420 --> 03:18.330
Frat Row was no longer a street.

03:18.330 --> 03:21.960
It was... a river...
- Ohh! - ...of blood!

03:27.470 --> 03:30.440
It was the death of Scooter
that rallied us together.

03:30.440 --> 03:34.040
Aah!

03:34.040 --> 03:36.540
The house mother was dead, see?

03:36.550 --> 03:39.580
And I became a full
Delta Bi Theta.

03:39.580 --> 03:41.550
But little did we know...

03:41.550 --> 03:44.020
mother had a daughter.

03:45.250 --> 03:49.120
Anyway, junior year,
we raged even harder.

03:50.630 --> 03:53.030
We thought we were
gonna live forever.

03:53.030 --> 03:55.300
And then fire... We were wrong.

03:55.300 --> 03:57.200
Could you hold
my hair back, bro?

03:57.200 --> 03:59.700
Someone took her place.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.570
Motherface.

04:04.570 --> 04:08.340
The junior-year streaking
contest was under way.

04:08.340 --> 04:09.640
I was supposed to officiate,

04:09.650 --> 04:12.080
but I couldn't go
because I got pink eye.

04:12.080 --> 04:15.680
That fart on my face
saved my life.

04:21.490 --> 04:25.330
Too bad I couldn't say
the same for Jimmy Galoshes.

04:31.430 --> 04:34.470
No one was safe
from her wrath...

04:34.470 --> 04:36.270
Yeah. "Areolas."
Gonna masturbate.

04:36.270 --> 04:37.500
...not even Little Spoon.

04:37.510 --> 04:39.340
Aah.

04:39.340 --> 04:42.340
Not Timmy and Tommy,
the Birdstone twins.

04:45.650 --> 04:47.380
Look, babe... no hands!

04:47.380 --> 04:50.320
Not concert pianist
Chaz Noodlemen.

04:50.320 --> 04:51.250
Aah! Aah! Aah!

04:51.250 --> 04:53.420
Aah! Aah!

04:55.090 --> 04:57.990
Not even our weed dealer.

04:57.990 --> 05:00.070
There was no way
to deal with the stress.

05:00.660 --> 05:02.630
Aaaah!

05:02.630 --> 05:04.700
Randall went on to have
three kids.

05:04.700 --> 05:06.370
He seems happy.
I'm actually grabbing lunch

05:06.370 --> 05:07.530
with him tomorrow.

05:07.540 --> 05:11.410
But then she killed Dolphman.

05:11.410 --> 05:14.140
It was Delta Bi genocide.

05:14.140 --> 05:15.510
But in the end,

05:15.510 --> 05:18.150
thanks to our good looks
and bond of brotherhood,

05:18.150 --> 05:21.680
the Delta Bis
triumphed once more.

05:21.680 --> 05:25.350
Looks like your flame...
retarded.

05:25.350 --> 05:28.260
I projected an air
of cool, calm confidence,

05:28.260 --> 05:29.690
'cause I'm Brock, you know?

05:29.690 --> 05:31.430
But something in her eyes...

05:31.430 --> 05:34.800
Something told me that nothing
could stop Motherface.

05:35.800 --> 05:38.700
...not even the grave.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.540
Brock!

05:41.540 --> 05:44.070
The serial killer
known as Motherface is dead.

05:44.070 --> 05:46.170
You told me
you killed her yourself.

05:46.180 --> 05:48.080
It's time you take your life...

05:49.310 --> 05:51.380
...back.

05:51.380 --> 05:53.050
Thank God my twin brother Brent

05:53.050 --> 05:55.750
didn't want to get
involved in the Greek system.

05:55.750 --> 05:57.750
We used to be so close.

05:57.750 --> 05:59.320
We haven't talked that much
since we went

05:59.320 --> 06:02.560
to different colleges,
but I still...

06:02.560 --> 06:06.490
feel him... like we
have some sort of...

06:06.500 --> 06:09.330
psychological connection.

06:09.330 --> 06:13.700
Brock, I need you to tell me
what you're most afraid of.

06:13.700 --> 06:16.470
Besides seeing all my bros
killed before my very eyes?

06:16.470 --> 06:17.600
Yes, besides that.

06:17.610 --> 06:20.640
Please, tell me everything.

06:20.640 --> 06:22.410
I don't know.

06:22.410 --> 06:24.410
After watching 17
of my best friends

06:24.410 --> 06:27.150
get killed by some crazy lady,

06:27.150 --> 06:30.120
I guess you could say I'm
a little bit afraid of women.

06:30.120 --> 06:31.390
Well, then it looks like
we're gonna have to

06:31.390 --> 06:33.250
cut this session short.

06:33.260 --> 06:34.820
Oh, I thought we
were making good progress.

06:34.820 --> 06:36.660
Really? What are you doing?!

07:00.580 --> 07:03.320
Aah! Damn it, Brock Chirino,
you punk!

07:03.320 --> 07:04.720
You're gonna kill someone
with that thing!

07:04.720 --> 07:08.420
No.
Ernest, that's Brent Chirino,

07:08.420 --> 07:09.790
Brock's twin brother.

07:09.790 --> 07:11.490
He transferred here
after Brock was killed

07:11.490 --> 07:15.300
in that brutal freak accident.
Oh.

07:15.300 --> 07:18.470
You know I've been trying
to work on my temper, Sebastian.

07:18.470 --> 07:20.600
Brock was the coolest.

07:26.540 --> 07:28.780
Hey, there
goes that sexy Brent Chirino.

07:28.780 --> 07:30.580
Too bad his twin brother died.

07:30.580 --> 07:32.480
I would've loved
to have been the meat

07:32.480 --> 07:34.180
in that Chirino sandwich.

07:34.180 --> 07:36.150
Yeah, at least
Brock wore a helmet!

07:36.150 --> 07:38.550
I'm looking at you, Brent!

07:38.550 --> 07:40.350
If you're hiding any drugs
in your butthole, missy,

07:40.360 --> 07:43.290
I swear to God...

07:46.560 --> 07:50.830
Brent... Look out!

07:50.830 --> 07:52.170
Brent.

07:52.170 --> 07:53.900
There's still time!

07:55.840 --> 07:57.240
Unh!

08:03.780 --> 08:05.880
You really threw me for a loop.

08:05.880 --> 08:08.520
I was on the edge of my seat.

08:08.520 --> 08:12.320
Say, aren't you that fella
whose cool brother was murdered?

08:12.320 --> 08:13.450
Whatever.

08:13.460 --> 08:15.190
I don't want to talk about it.

08:15.190 --> 08:17.960
Well, name's Nedry...
Nedry Headcheese.

08:17.960 --> 08:20.660
Chirino... <i>Brent</i> Chirino.

08:20.660 --> 08:22.500
I think you'll find
I have a lot to offer

08:22.500 --> 08:23.930
as a best friend.

08:23.930 --> 08:26.670
Whatever, man.
I'm not here to make friends.

08:26.670 --> 08:29.270
I'm here to find out
who murdered my brother

08:29.270 --> 08:31.610
and get revenge.

08:31.610 --> 08:33.809
Say, isn't this the frat

08:33.809 --> 08:35.880
your murdered brother
belonged to?

08:40.820 --> 08:42.480
Maybe we could pledge together,

08:42.480 --> 08:45.390
find out what <i> really</i>
happened to your brother.

08:45.390 --> 08:47.260
I always thought...
I promised myself

08:47.260 --> 08:49.620
I would never join a fraternity.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.730
I already had one brother.

08:51.730 --> 08:56.360
I don't need any other brothers.

08:56.370 --> 08:58.370
And that's why,
even though a pack of wolves

08:58.370 --> 08:59.670
took the use of my legs,

08:59.670 --> 09:02.770
I decided to become
a zoology major.

09:02.770 --> 09:05.410
My whole family
was once murdered by wolves.

09:10.280 --> 09:12.310
Well, well, well...

09:12.310 --> 09:14.780
If it isn't Brock Chirino,
back from the dead.

09:14.780 --> 09:19.390
Actually,
I'm Brock's twin brother, Brent.

09:19.390 --> 09:21.860
Weird.

09:21.860 --> 09:23.390
Hey, you looking to pledge?

09:23.390 --> 09:25.260
Great to have you
aboard Delta Bi.

09:25.260 --> 09:26.690
- Oh, I...
- But I...

09:26.700 --> 09:28.000
I understand, you know?

09:28.000 --> 09:29.030
If you need some more time
to get over

09:29.030 --> 09:32.930
your brother's tragic death...
No.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.470
I'm done grieving.

09:34.470 --> 09:37.600
I'm ready to party
until my pants fall off.

09:39.340 --> 09:40.740
Welcome to Delta Bi Theta.

09:40.740 --> 09:42.710
I think you're gonna fit
right in with the guys.

09:42.710 --> 09:44.950
I'm Derek. I'm the friendliest
guy you'll meet here.

09:44.950 --> 09:46.280
Shut the fuck up, Derek!

09:46.280 --> 09:48.550
Nice comeback, bro.

09:48.550 --> 09:50.320
Don't mind the camera.
That's Z.Q.

09:50.320 --> 09:52.950
You should see the workout tapes
he makes of us bros.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.820
They're very... artistic.

09:55.820 --> 09:58.290
- Hi.
- Hello.

09:58.290 --> 10:00.460
Come on. Let's go inside.

10:11.710 --> 10:13.670
Siskel and Ebert say
"Pizza Goblins"

10:13.680 --> 10:14.940
is "family magic."

10:14.940 --> 10:16.680
"Two thumbs way down."

10:18.650 --> 10:19.910
Dragons fr...

10:22.980 --> 10:24.520
Welcome to Delta Bi.

10:24.520 --> 10:27.720
You'll see
that the party never stops here.

10:27.720 --> 10:30.620
That's Spike.
He rages harder than any of us.

10:32.460 --> 10:33.860
Classic Spike.

10:33.860 --> 10:35.330
That there is Sizzler.

10:35.330 --> 10:36.700
He's trying to pledge Delta Bi,

10:36.700 --> 10:39.070
but he won't get in
'cause he's a vegetarian.

10:39.070 --> 10:40.070
What?

10:44.640 --> 10:46.610
This here is Samzy.

10:46.610 --> 10:48.690
He has a lot
of memories of your brother.

10:54.980 --> 10:59.020
I made them just like you
like them, Samzy... overhard.

10:59.890 --> 11:01.860
- Pretty nice.
- Overhard.

11:01.860 --> 11:03.960
Like you, Samzy.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.460
Sorry.

11:05.460 --> 11:07.630
Samzy's a bit of a bitch.

11:07.630 --> 11:10.730
Oh. That explains it.

11:17.670 --> 11:18.840
This is Todd.

11:18.840 --> 11:20.910
We call him T-O-Double-D
for short.

11:20.910 --> 11:22.840
He's pre-med.
Smartest guy in the frat.

11:22.850 --> 11:23.880
Ohh!

11:23.880 --> 11:25.410
Jesus, Derek, not now!

11:25.410 --> 11:27.150
I got a lot on my mind.

11:27.150 --> 11:29.020
Look at all my work
that I'm doing.

11:29.020 --> 11:31.520
With midterms and finals
for everyone, what...

11:34.490 --> 11:36.790
Brock?
Oh, this is actually Brent,

11:36.790 --> 11:39.060
Brock's twin brother.

11:39.060 --> 11:40.060
Weird.

11:41.030 --> 11:42.630
- Surprise!
- No!

11:46.400 --> 11:48.570
Ugh! Samantha, what the fuck?!

11:50.540 --> 11:52.540
That's Todd's girlfriend,
Samantha.

11:52.540 --> 11:55.610
She's a psych major, which means
she's a total psycho.

11:55.610 --> 11:57.480
But, uh, you know,
she owns a motor home,

11:57.480 --> 11:58.780
- so it's cool.
- Oh.

11:58.780 --> 12:00.810
Babe, you can't keep
coming in here,

12:00.820 --> 12:02.520
bringing delicious treats
for me.

12:02.520 --> 12:04.650
But you deserve a treat, Todd!

12:04.650 --> 12:06.050
Just a little bit of pampering

12:06.050 --> 12:08.860
before our big anniversary
getaway weekend

12:08.860 --> 12:11.590
in old-town Sacramento.

12:11.990 --> 12:14.530
I guess I do deserve a treat.

12:14.530 --> 12:16.130
Mm-hmm.

12:16.130 --> 12:17.730
But they're over on the floor.

12:29.180 --> 12:31.450
Sorry I tossed your cookies
back there.

12:31.450 --> 12:32.780
That's okay. I'm used to it.

12:32.780 --> 12:35.050
What do you mean?

12:35.050 --> 12:37.120
I've always wanted
to be a Delta Bi.

12:37.120 --> 12:39.750
Be one of these guys? Why?

12:39.760 --> 12:42.590
Delta Bi is the coolest frat
in Chico,

12:42.590 --> 12:44.120
but I'm a girl,

12:44.130 --> 12:47.130
so I could never join,
even though I'm a legacy.

12:47.130 --> 12:49.000
Listen...

12:49.000 --> 12:52.470
I know
what it's like to not belong.

12:52.470 --> 12:53.870
Brent!

12:53.870 --> 12:55.770
I'm coming, guys!

12:55.770 --> 12:57.040
I'm coming!

12:57.040 --> 12:58.540
All right, I came.

12:58.540 --> 13:01.010
Some pretty sweet tai chi
back there.

13:01.010 --> 13:02.740
Knew you'd fit in here.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.880
But I never knew tai chi.

13:04.880 --> 13:08.820
My dead brother knew tai chi.

13:08.820 --> 13:09.880
You okay?

13:09.890 --> 13:11.150
Sure.

13:11.150 --> 13:13.590
Uh, where's Brock's old room?

13:18.630 --> 13:19.930
Yeah.

13:34.940 --> 13:39.950
And the winner for best dancer
at prom, Brent Chirino!

13:41.920 --> 13:43.820
Ugh! This is my room!

13:43.820 --> 13:47.220
I called dibs on this room like
two minutes after Brock died!

13:47.220 --> 13:49.590
Shit!

13:49.590 --> 13:50.790
You got to get out of here!

13:50.790 --> 13:52.630
I got to haze a pledge
right now.

13:52.630 --> 13:54.560
- This is Turbeaux.
- I'm Turbeaux.

13:54.560 --> 13:56.860
Shit! Pinch me, pledge.

13:56.870 --> 13:59.000
Oh! Pinch me harder!

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Aah! Guess I'm not dreaming.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.240
Brock told me about you...

14:02.240 --> 14:04.170
Little
Brenty Brent Brent Chirino.

14:04.170 --> 14:06.540
Hmm!
He said you're a bit of a loner.

14:06.540 --> 14:09.540
Actually, Turbeaux,
Brent's thinking about pledging.

14:09.550 --> 14:11.210
Oh, really?!

14:11.210 --> 14:13.210
You want to get into this frat?

14:13.220 --> 14:15.120
You want to learn our secrets?

14:15.120 --> 14:16.720
You got to get through me.

14:16.720 --> 14:18.790
Sizzler!

14:18.790 --> 14:21.660
Or maybe you don't have
what it takes to be a Delta Bi.

14:21.660 --> 14:22.690
Do or die!

14:22.690 --> 14:24.060
You think you can handle...

14:24.060 --> 14:25.660
- this?!
- Aah!

14:25.660 --> 14:28.190
You <i> think</i> you can handle this?!

14:28.200 --> 14:29.060
Ohh!

14:29.060 --> 14:33.170
You think... you
can handle this?

14:33.170 --> 14:34.030
Aah!

14:34.040 --> 14:35.170
- This?
- Aah!

14:35.170 --> 14:36.340
This?

14:36.340 --> 14:38.140
- Ohh!
- This?

14:38.140 --> 14:39.570
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aahn=!

14:39.580 --> 14:42.310
You think you can handle this?!

14:42.310 --> 14:44.010
Do you... think...

14:44.010 --> 14:47.910
you... can... handle... this?!

14:47.920 --> 14:49.350
Watch me not give a shit!

14:49.350 --> 14:51.050
- Sizzler!
- Ohh!

14:51.050 --> 14:52.890
I don't care about you!

14:52.890 --> 14:54.750
I don't care
where you came from!

14:54.760 --> 14:56.860
Your ancestors mean nothing!

14:56.860 --> 15:00.590
You bring shame to all of us!

15:00.600 --> 15:01.860
Yes, sir.

15:01.860 --> 15:04.030
Actually,
Brent was thinking about

15:04.030 --> 15:06.030
helping us out
with our senior prank.

15:08.270 --> 15:10.600
Oh, really?

15:10.610 --> 15:14.140
Well, our pranks
are pretty goddamn wild.

15:14.140 --> 15:16.180
This year's gonna
be no different.

15:16.180 --> 15:18.010
Gonna be bonkers!

15:18.010 --> 15:20.780
We're gonna need a real party
boy to pull off this prank.

15:20.780 --> 15:23.150
Is that you?

15:23.150 --> 15:24.620
You daddy's party boy?

15:24.620 --> 15:26.120
Yes.

15:26.120 --> 15:28.760
Look at you.
You'll never be a Delta Bi.

15:28.760 --> 15:31.160
I'm gonna whup your ass
with my big paddle now.

15:31.160 --> 15:32.390
It's in my closet.

15:36.130 --> 15:37.860
Aaaaaah!

15:38.400 --> 15:40.900
Oh, man!

15:40.900 --> 15:42.270
- God!
- I think I captured

15:42.270 --> 15:43.370
some genuine fear there.

15:43.370 --> 15:44.800
God, guys!

15:44.810 --> 15:46.910
You know how I feel
about baby dogs!

15:46.910 --> 15:48.380
Oh! We got you so good!

15:48.380 --> 15:52.080
Get the fuck out of here,
Samantha!

15:52.080 --> 15:52.950
Why?!

15:52.950 --> 15:55.050
God, guys! Guys!

15:55.050 --> 15:57.650
I got this for Brock
for his 16th birthday.

15:57.650 --> 16:01.190
It looks just like our childhood
dog, Dr. Bagels.

16:01.190 --> 16:03.290
- To me... to Turbeaux!
- Ha!

16:03.290 --> 16:04.690
To your bro!

16:04.690 --> 16:06.990
But I need Turbeaux to trust me.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.700
I hate puppies, too!

16:09.700 --> 16:11.870
Unh!

16:11.870 --> 16:14.270
Really?

16:14.270 --> 16:17.670
Maybe you are okay, Not Brock.

16:17.670 --> 16:20.010
Maybe you are okay.

16:20.010 --> 16:24.080
Hey, Sizzler, get the window.
Z.Q., shut that camera off.

16:24.080 --> 16:25.350
Brent,
think about spending the night

16:25.350 --> 16:26.780
in my room
once I'm all moved in.

16:26.780 --> 16:28.740
Let's check out
these prank plans.

16:29.990 --> 16:33.390
Oh.
First, we're gonna need these.

16:33.390 --> 16:35.690
That's tape.

16:35.690 --> 16:38.020
Whoo!

16:38.030 --> 16:40.390
Goddamn!

16:40.400 --> 16:43.200
They gave us so much
of that beer stuff.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.930
I have the spins.

16:44.930 --> 16:46.370
I can't even read this sign.

16:46.370 --> 16:47.800
Calm down, Nedry!

16:47.800 --> 16:49.440
According to these plank prints,

16:49.440 --> 16:53.210
it says the college radio
station is right up there.

16:53.210 --> 16:56.110
So, remember,
when we get on the air,

16:56.110 --> 16:57.410
you're gonna say,

16:57.410 --> 17:01.480
"Dean Pepperstone eats farts,"
okay?

17:01.480 --> 17:03.250
And be sure not to mess it up,

17:03.250 --> 17:05.390
'cause I have to get
into this frat

17:05.390 --> 17:09.819
to find out who was the murderer
to my brother.

17:09.829 --> 17:11.890
Whatever you say, best friend!

17:11.890 --> 17:14.290
They murdered my brother!

17:15.130 --> 17:17.460
Chico Tower,
this is Pan Am flight 912,

17:17.470 --> 17:19.300
requesting permission to land.

17:19.300 --> 17:23.270
Okay!
Dean Pepperstone eats farts!

17:23.270 --> 17:24.869
Dean Pepperst...

17:24.869 --> 17:26.369
Listen, this is
air-traffic control tower.

17:26.369 --> 17:27.740
Get off this frequency!

17:27.740 --> 17:29.340
You get off this frequency.

17:29.340 --> 17:31.010
I am a pilot.
I have a plane to land!

17:31.010 --> 17:33.310
I'm gonna crash!
Dean Pepperstone eats farts!

17:33.320 --> 17:35.780
Oh, God, I'm so sorry!

17:41.290 --> 17:46.360
You Delta Bi Thetas
have done it for the last time!

17:46.360 --> 17:48.830
You killed 250 people,

17:48.830 --> 17:51.030
and I do not eat farts.

17:51.030 --> 17:52.830
Listen, you need to give us
a second chance.

17:52.830 --> 17:54.430
I've given you enough chances!

17:54.440 --> 17:57.140
Need I remind you
of last year's prank,

17:57.140 --> 17:58.840
when you broke the county dam

17:58.840 --> 18:02.910
and submerged Ol' Parchtown
in water?

18:02.910 --> 18:04.840
But we created New Lake City.

18:04.850 --> 18:06.480
You drowned 4,000 people.

18:06.480 --> 18:08.920
The paddle-boat business
is booming there.

18:08.920 --> 18:12.420
Don't make me remind you
of sophomore-year prank.

18:14.320 --> 18:16.990
Sophomores, get to the chopper!

18:16.990 --> 18:19.190
We are leaving!

18:19.190 --> 18:21.090
Sophomores, get to the chopper!

18:21.100 --> 18:22.400
That's not fair!

18:22.400 --> 18:24.230
Freshman-year prank,
let me remind you,

18:24.230 --> 18:25.930
we helped...

18:25.930 --> 18:28.200
depose a Central American
dictator.

18:28.200 --> 18:31.440
That's true.
Your heavy-metal hot-air balloon

18:31.440 --> 18:34.940
did drive General Cortez
from the Brazilian embassy,

18:34.940 --> 18:37.810
which is
why I'm only suspending you.

18:37.810 --> 18:39.080
During Greek Week?!

18:39.080 --> 18:40.910
What's wrong with you?!

18:40.920 --> 18:42.580
Come on!
It's like Easter for men!

18:42.580 --> 18:44.550
You can have your own Greek Week

18:44.550 --> 18:47.120
out at the old sorority house...

18:47.120 --> 18:49.520
- by the lake.
- What? Ugh!

18:49.520 --> 18:51.420
They never pick up
their dog shit!

18:51.430 --> 18:53.460
- It's haunted!
- No!

18:55.230 --> 18:58.000
Go there, brother.

19:00.130 --> 19:02.270
Guys, a weekend at the lake?

19:02.270 --> 19:04.170
That's nothing, right?

19:04.170 --> 19:08.840
It'll be like a...
Like a Dude Bro party!

19:08.840 --> 19:10.480
Yeah. Okay.

19:10.480 --> 19:11.880
Yeah.

19:11.880 --> 19:13.450
A Dude Bro party.

19:13.450 --> 19:15.350
And maybe you could invite some,

19:15.350 --> 19:19.390
uh, young, nubile,
recently divorced women?

19:19.390 --> 19:21.220
- No!
- No!

19:21.220 --> 19:22.220
Bullshit!

19:22.220 --> 19:23.520
Come on! No girls allowed!

19:23.530 --> 19:24.990
Fine! Fine! Get out!

19:24.990 --> 19:27.160
Get out, all of you!

19:27.160 --> 19:28.530
Somebody help me!

19:28.530 --> 19:30.430
Should I lock this?

19:37.440 --> 19:38.340
It's done.

19:38.340 --> 19:40.010
Excellent.

19:40.010 --> 19:45.410
Soon, the Dude Bros
will taste their own blood.

19:45.410 --> 19:52.050
All that's required now
is a virgin sacrifice.

19:52.050 --> 19:54.250
Virgo sacrificium.

19:54.260 --> 19:56.020
Yes, yes. Virgo Sacramento.

19:56.020 --> 20:00.130
- Whatever.
- Virgo sacrificium.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.100
Virgo sacrificium.

20:03.100 --> 20:05.000
No!

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Aah! Ohh!

20:07.000 --> 20:09.370
Aah!

20:09.370 --> 20:13.440
Virgo sacrificium!

20:13.440 --> 20:17.280
I'm an immortal fuck machine!

20:19.450 --> 20:21.050
Buttiker, get in here!

20:21.050 --> 20:24.420
Uh-oh! Someone's in trouble!

20:27.050 --> 20:30.190
- Yes, Chief.
- Ah. Candace Buttiker.

20:30.190 --> 20:32.260
First in your class
at Naval Academy,

20:32.260 --> 20:33.590
in Valencia, Florida.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.530
Are you ready for a real-world.

20:35.530 --> 20:37.200
Chico police mission?

20:37.200 --> 20:38.400
Oh, daddy like!

20:38.400 --> 20:39.970
What have you got for me, Chief?

20:39.970 --> 20:41.970
Motherface is rising
on the harvest moon

20:41.970 --> 20:44.100
to kill the Delta Bis,

20:44.110 --> 20:47.540
but her plan won't work
without a virgin sacrifice.

20:47.540 --> 20:50.440
That's where that idiot
virgin Sminkle comes in.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.510
Aah! Fuck! My face!

20:52.510 --> 20:55.650
You want me to send
Officer Sminkle to his death.

20:55.650 --> 21:01.150
You see, only his death
will give Motherface the power

21:01.160 --> 21:05.220
to defeat the Delta Bis
when it matters the most.

21:05.230 --> 21:08.330
And, um, what would you like me
to tell him?

21:08.330 --> 21:11.200
Watch this.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.140
Sminkle, get in here!

21:16.140 --> 21:18.370
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!

21:18.370 --> 21:19.540
Aw, come on, Chief!

21:19.540 --> 21:21.040
I thought we talked about this.

21:21.040 --> 21:24.640
No girls allowed
in the Dude Room.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.180
I'm fine. Ah-choo!

21:29.180 --> 21:31.080
Aah! What the hell?!

21:31.090 --> 21:32.590
Sminkle, um,

21:32.590 --> 21:35.120
I have kind of an important
assignment for you, if...

21:35.120 --> 21:36.520
If you think you're up for it.

21:36.520 --> 21:39.130
Oh, my gosh. Oh, absolutely.

21:39.130 --> 21:41.730
Wait a second, though.
Don't... don't you hate me?

21:41.730 --> 21:44.100
'Cause you called me
a cum bubble yesterday.

21:44.100 --> 21:46.070
Well, the way you got that girl
to confess

21:46.070 --> 21:48.770
that she was hiding
those drugs in her butthole,

21:48.770 --> 21:50.340
that was pretty impressive.

21:50.340 --> 21:52.670
And I'd like
to kind of give you a reward.

21:52.670 --> 21:56.140
You know about Chico's
orange-shortage problem, right?

21:56.140 --> 21:58.340
Oh, yes.
It's very terrible, Chief.

21:58.350 --> 22:01.250
City-wide vitamin-C levels
have never been lower.

22:01.250 --> 22:04.320
Well, uh,
turns out your old friends

22:04.320 --> 22:09.420
the Dude Bros are, in reality...

22:09.420 --> 22:12.060
bags of oranges.

22:15.700 --> 22:17.560
I should've known.

22:17.570 --> 22:21.570
So, what I need you to do
is find them,

22:21.570 --> 22:23.240
bop them on the nose,

22:23.240 --> 22:25.740
and turn them back
into their actual forms,

22:25.740 --> 22:27.370
which as I said earlier,

22:27.380 --> 22:31.080
are bags of oranges.

22:31.080 --> 22:32.680
Save our city, Sminkle.

22:32.680 --> 22:35.350
Officer Buttiker
will accompany you

22:35.350 --> 22:40.590
to bop the Dude Bros on the nose

22:40.590 --> 22:48.590
and turn them back into
bags of fucking oranges.

22:49.230 --> 22:52.130
Got it! You won't regret this,
Chief-a-rooney!

22:52.130 --> 22:55.300
See? Now Officer Sminkle's
Spazwagon

22:55.300 --> 22:57.100
is all gassed up.

22:57.110 --> 23:00.210
The Dude Bros are at the old
sorority house by the lake.

23:00.210 --> 23:02.540
And get there
before the harvest moon.

23:02.540 --> 23:04.440
The town is depending on you.

23:14.250 --> 23:15.290
Come on, guys!

23:15.290 --> 23:19.430
Let's get some tunes in here!

23:21.230 --> 23:22.700
What the shit is this?!

23:22.700 --> 23:23.830
Yeah, Todd.

23:23.830 --> 23:26.770
What <i> is</i> all this about?

23:26.770 --> 23:30.340
Flowers, the music, champagne,

23:30.340 --> 23:32.410
that banner I refuse to read...

23:32.410 --> 23:35.510
Guys, Samantha loves you,

23:35.510 --> 23:39.350
and she wants us to have
a good time by the lake.

23:47.650 --> 23:49.660
Aah!

23:49.660 --> 23:51.890
Hey, Todd, Samantha
take your virginity yet?

23:51.890 --> 23:53.390
Not yet.

23:53.390 --> 23:55.900
She's been really pushing me,
though.

23:55.900 --> 23:57.800
And I'm not ready to be a dad.

23:57.800 --> 24:00.300
Guys, there's baby stuff
in here! Gah!

24:00.300 --> 24:02.270
Hey! No! No baby stuff!

24:02.270 --> 24:03.800
- Baby hats...
- Put that stuff back!

24:03.810 --> 24:06.710
No babies!
No, Todd, we're Americans!

24:06.710 --> 24:10.440
We can do whatever we want
with no consequences!

24:10.450 --> 24:12.680
No consequences in America!

24:12.680 --> 24:14.750
A toast to Brent.

24:14.750 --> 24:16.550
Boo!

24:16.550 --> 24:19.650
Hey, now, pour that pledge
a pint of Prosecco, partner.

24:19.650 --> 24:22.690
Chirino perfectly pulled off
our senior prank.

24:22.690 --> 24:25.530
We wanted the whole world
to know that Dean Pepperstone

24:25.530 --> 24:26.760
- eats farts.
- Thank you.

24:26.760 --> 24:28.630
And I think
they got the message.

24:28.630 --> 24:30.660
Speech! Speech! Right now!

24:30.670 --> 24:34.870
Um... I guess I just
want to say, uh,

24:34.870 --> 24:42.180
I can see why my brother
was so stoked on you guys.

24:42.180 --> 24:46.950
Um... and, uh...

24:50.650 --> 24:51.720
Titties.

24:51.720 --> 24:52.920
Yeah!

24:52.920 --> 24:54.190
- Yeah!
- All right.

24:54.190 --> 24:54.950
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

24:54.960 --> 24:56.890
Yeah!

24:56.890 --> 24:59.490
Yes! Oh, my favorite!

24:59.490 --> 25:03.400
- Yeah!
- Forever's gonna start tonight!

25:03.400 --> 25:06.230
- Delta Bi! Do or die!
- It speaks!

25:06.230 --> 25:19.750
Delta Bi! Do or die!
Delta Bi! Do or die!

25:19.750 --> 25:22.950
How are we gonna get
across this lake?

25:32.290 --> 25:34.890
Well, that's enough footage
of that.

25:34.900 --> 25:37.500
Someone want to get
his attention?

25:37.500 --> 25:38.500
Come on, pledge.

25:38.500 --> 25:39.630
I'm over this tear shit.

25:39.630 --> 25:40.770
Go get us some paddy boats.

25:40.770 --> 25:41.870
Come on!

25:46.410 --> 25:48.370
Uh... Uh, hello?

25:48.380 --> 25:49.640
Go away!

25:49.640 --> 25:51.780
Can't you see
I'm mourning the dea...

26:05.560 --> 26:07.990
Oh.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
Hey! The Delta Bis!

26:12.000 --> 26:14.270
I was just celebrating
the anniversary

26:14.270 --> 26:17.700
of my business
finally taking off, huh?

26:17.710 --> 26:20.810
I have you boys
to thank for that.

26:22.940 --> 26:25.910
Stand over there,
next to my dead family!

26:25.910 --> 26:27.650
Come on. Yep.

26:27.650 --> 26:30.750
Nobody wanted to rent
a paddy boat in Ol' Parchtown.

26:30.750 --> 26:32.990
I was swimming in debt.

26:32.990 --> 26:34.920
Until you boys flooded the town

26:34.920 --> 26:37.060
and drowned my whole family,
that is.

26:37.060 --> 26:40.030
Now business is booming!

26:40.030 --> 26:42.960
Go ahead... put your arm
around my wife.

26:42.960 --> 26:45.730
My beautiful wife!

26:45.730 --> 26:48.970
She died doing what she loved.

26:48.970 --> 26:51.300
- Drowning?
- Yeah.

26:51.310 --> 26:52.840
Not much reason
for swimming lessons

26:52.840 --> 26:54.610
if you lived in Ol' Parchtown,

26:54.610 --> 26:58.710
which is what made it such
a particularly funny prank.

27:02.420 --> 27:05.750
Now let's do a goofy one!

27:05.750 --> 27:08.420
I said make it goofy!

27:20.400 --> 27:22.100
That's a great picture.

27:22.100 --> 27:25.500
Oh, man,
that's my baby boy, too.

27:25.510 --> 27:29.680
16 months old when the water
took him away.

27:29.680 --> 27:32.010
You guys still got it!

27:32.010 --> 27:34.350
Pranksters till the end!

27:34.350 --> 27:36.720
The bitter... end.

27:38.020 --> 27:40.020
You boys want to rent
a paddy boat?

27:43.120 --> 27:45.520
What paddy boat
are you gonna choose, Brock?

27:45.530 --> 27:48.490
- I'm Brent.
- Okay. All right.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.900
I trust that you have a paddy
boat that will accommodate

27:50.900 --> 27:51.960
- my lifestyle.
- No.

27:51.970 --> 27:53.100
Oh.

27:53.100 --> 27:55.770
If I remember correctly,
and I do,

27:55.770 --> 27:58.000
there's a handicap paddle boat
about 20 miles that way.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.710
Yeah! Fuck off, Nerdry!

28:00.710 --> 28:02.110
Don't tell me to F off!

28:02.110 --> 28:03.910
I'll F you
if you don't come back for me!

28:03.910 --> 28:06.650
Whoa, whoa! Nerdry, come on.

28:06.650 --> 28:07.710
You're in college now.

28:07.720 --> 28:09.120
You can say "fuck."

28:09.120 --> 28:11.080
Give it a try.

28:11.090 --> 28:16.390
F-f-f-f-f-f... F-f-f-f-f-f-fu...

28:17.790 --> 28:19.460
You won't leave me here,
will you?

28:19.460 --> 28:21.890
I got to go with them.
You understand.

28:21.900 --> 28:23.500
Here.

28:23.500 --> 28:25.800
In case your wheelchair
breaks down.

28:25.800 --> 28:26.930
Uh, thanks.

28:26.930 --> 28:28.670
Radical deck.

28:28.670 --> 28:31.500
Well, see you there, Brent.

28:31.510 --> 28:33.570
Don't forget to avenge
your murdered brother!

28:33.570 --> 28:35.980
Okay! One more picture!

28:35.980 --> 28:37.180
And surprise me!

28:37.180 --> 28:38.710
Like when you blew up the dam

28:38.710 --> 28:41.580
and took everyone
I knew and loved!

28:49.090 --> 28:51.760
Well, they don't call me
Ol' Iron Arms Headcheese

28:51.760 --> 28:52.790
for nothing.

28:52.790 --> 28:54.430
Just 20 more miles,

28:54.430 --> 28:56.100
and I'll have an ice-cold brew
waiting for me.

28:56.100 --> 28:59.470
Ha!

28:59.470 --> 29:01.970
Oh, monkey butts.

29:01.970 --> 29:05.040
Is it so pooping hard
to load a legacy

29:05.040 --> 29:07.970
into a... a whore paddle boat?!

29:07.980 --> 29:09.040
That's it.

29:09.040 --> 29:10.940
I'm gonna say it.

29:10.950 --> 29:13.080
F-f-f-fuck this creek!

29:14.480 --> 29:16.780
Those dick farts
never gave two shitting bitches

29:16.780 --> 29:18.150
about Ol' Iron Arms.

29:18.150 --> 29:19.850
They'll see.

29:19.850 --> 29:22.720
I'll show those vagina
faces what's what.

29:22.720 --> 29:26.960
Those Delta Bi titty jizzers
will regret the day they were...

29:26.960 --> 29:28.560
Guys?

29:31.060 --> 29:32.900
Help.

30:03.660 --> 30:05.730
My psychic told me
my son's head would cave in

30:05.730 --> 30:08.700
from a car accident,
and hello, prom night.

30:13.770 --> 30:15.270
And the number-one reason

30:15.280 --> 30:19.280
men and women
just can't get along...

30:19.280 --> 30:21.510
The remote control!

30:21.520 --> 30:22.780
What do you think, Candace?

30:22.780 --> 30:24.520
Think Letterman will go
for these lists?

30:24.520 --> 30:26.190
I'm not here to humor you,
Sminkle.

30:26.190 --> 30:29.660
Top 10 reasons Letterman
will go for these Top 10 lists.

30:29.660 --> 30:32.960
Number 10,
my boundless enthusiasm.

30:32.960 --> 30:34.860
32 more hours, Candace.

30:34.860 --> 30:37.730
Number 9, that man
is slapping a little boy.

30:37.730 --> 30:39.000
- What?
- That man is

30:39.000 --> 30:40.730
slapping a little boy!
Oh, my God!

30:40.740 --> 30:42.130
You think you're cooler than me

30:42.140 --> 30:45.570
just 'cause you got
a fancy tie and a job?!

30:45.570 --> 30:48.240
Yaaah!

30:48.240 --> 30:50.240
Here's $100 and
"The Grapes of Wrath," kid!

30:50.240 --> 30:51.940
Get out of town!
Change your name!

30:51.950 --> 30:53.550
Start a new life for yourself!

30:53.550 --> 30:55.750
Keep going! Keep going!
You can do it!

30:55.750 --> 30:58.550
And once you get into the trees
for the night,

30:58.550 --> 31:00.920
I want you to read
that fucking book!

31:02.590 --> 31:05.320
That was, uh, pretty impressive
how you handled that.

31:05.330 --> 31:08.330
Yeah, well,
every child deserves a chance.

31:09.730 --> 31:11.730
Aaaaaaah!

31:11.730 --> 31:13.200
I love children.

31:13.200 --> 31:15.170
They're the future that we
screwed up for ourselves,

31:15.170 --> 31:18.100
you know? So innocent.

31:18.110 --> 31:21.040
I guess you probably don't care
about this crazy dream

31:21.040 --> 31:22.910
that I have, but, uh...

31:24.680 --> 31:27.980
I want to open up
a mobile library for children.

31:27.980 --> 31:29.980
- Really?
- You see, the first time

31:29.980 --> 31:32.790
I read a book,
my mind went bang!

31:32.790 --> 31:35.250
Like, anything
in the universe was possible,

31:35.260 --> 31:37.860
and I could find
it all in the pages of a book.

31:37.860 --> 31:40.130
And, well,
that's what I want to do

31:40.130 --> 31:42.260
for all the children of Chico.

31:42.260 --> 31:44.700
I just want to bang them all.

31:47.600 --> 31:48.870
- Um...
- I'm gonna call it.

31:48.870 --> 31:51.000
Sminkle's Bang Bus, Candace.

31:51.010 --> 31:54.610
No more waiting in the public
library to bang every kid I see.

31:54.610 --> 31:57.080
No, sir, I'm going to travel
from block to block,

31:57.080 --> 31:58.940
screaming out my window for kids

31:58.950 --> 32:02.350
to climb aboard my bus
and get banged silly.

32:02.350 --> 32:04.380
I mean,
your heart's in the right place,

32:04.390 --> 32:07.950
but, um, how about "bookmobile"?

32:07.960 --> 32:09.820
- Yeah?
- Not gonna lie, Candace...

32:09.820 --> 32:12.760
That sounds real boring.

32:12.760 --> 32:15.860
I would not want to get banged
in a bookmobile.

32:17.700 --> 32:18.860
- My bang bus.
- Oh, no!

32:18.870 --> 32:20.670
- Oh, no, no, no!
- My bang bus!

32:20.670 --> 32:21.830
My dream!

32:25.170 --> 32:26.310
Sminkle!

32:26.310 --> 32:27.870
Aw, man!

32:27.880 --> 32:31.080
Why does it have
to not be a person anymore?

32:31.080 --> 32:32.080
Ugh.

32:43.190 --> 32:44.420
There it is.

32:44.430 --> 32:46.730
The old sorority house
by the lake.

33:03.740 --> 33:06.780
Damn it! This place
is a fucking shit-hole!

33:06.780 --> 33:08.210
Who did this?!

33:08.220 --> 33:09.980
Aah!

33:12.050 --> 33:16.390
Someone... someone
else somewhere is in here.

33:27.700 --> 33:31.900
- Relax, bros! It's me!
- Rip Stick!

33:31.910 --> 33:34.370
Thought you'd rock out
on the lake without me, yeah?

33:34.380 --> 33:36.840
We thought you died
in the embassy.

33:41.150 --> 33:45.250
Part of me did die that day.

33:45.250 --> 33:46.720
But now I'm back!

33:46.720 --> 33:48.390
Rippin' and stickin'!

33:53.130 --> 33:56.200
And I see I'm not the only one
back from the dead, Brock.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.730
Brock did die.

33:57.730 --> 34:01.000
That's his twin brother, Brent.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.370
Weird.

34:02.370 --> 34:04.470
Well, let's clean
this stupid shit-hole

34:04.470 --> 34:06.000
up so we can party, eh?!

34:06.010 --> 34:07.240
Yeah!

34:07.240 --> 34:09.170
All right!

35:19.310 --> 35:21.810
Hey!

35:31.020 --> 35:32.940
This is more like it, huh, guys?

35:34.230 --> 35:36.400
Okay. Now start partying.

35:41.040 --> 35:42.400
Yeah!

35:50.440 --> 35:53.110
Oh! No, no!
It's happening again!

35:53.110 --> 35:54.310
Again! It's happening again!

35:54.320 --> 35:56.010
What is your problem, Samzy?!

35:56.020 --> 35:57.850
Yeah, chill out, Samzy!

35:57.850 --> 35:59.250
Self-righteous fuck!

35:59.250 --> 36:01.350
Samzy, you need to chill out,
all right?

36:01.360 --> 36:04.520
This is just an old house
with old fuses, bro.

36:04.530 --> 36:05.590
Old fuses.

36:05.590 --> 36:07.390
That's what I said... fuses.

36:07.390 --> 36:08.930
Old fuses, huh?

36:08.930 --> 36:11.500
- They are fuses, motherfucker!
- It's old!

36:11.500 --> 36:13.370
The fuse box is in the shed,

36:13.370 --> 36:15.030
if I remember correctly.

36:15.040 --> 36:17.240
Derek, you know how to be
a handyman from your dad.

36:17.240 --> 36:18.870
- Go out there.
- I told you,

36:18.870 --> 36:20.440
I hate handyman work.

36:20.440 --> 36:23.310
You never told me that, bro.
You never told me that.

36:23.310 --> 36:25.940
I would have not said that
if you had told me that earlier.

36:38.120 --> 36:39.460
I'm so sorry.

36:40.260 --> 36:42.130
Here goes nothing.

36:51.070 --> 36:53.340
All right, Derek,
you can do this.

36:53.340 --> 36:55.540
You've been working
with a therapist on this.

36:55.540 --> 36:57.240
You can do it.

36:57.240 --> 36:59.580
They're just tools.

36:59.580 --> 37:02.050
They're all just a bunch
of tools.

37:05.290 --> 37:07.520
Oh, no!

37:21.970 --> 37:25.240
All just a bunch of tools.

37:39.490 --> 37:41.590
Aha. Gotcha.

37:43.360 --> 37:45.360
Aaaah!

37:45.360 --> 37:47.490
Hoes before bros!

37:50.200 --> 37:51.630
Derek did it!

37:51.630 --> 37:53.300
The electricity!

38:03.240 --> 38:04.710
Come dance with us.

38:04.710 --> 38:07.450
Brent, go dance with them. Go.

38:07.450 --> 38:09.310
Go, go, go.

38:09.320 --> 38:13.250
D-a-ance?

38:13.250 --> 38:14.650
With someone?

38:15.560 --> 38:17.690
I did that once.

38:24.430 --> 38:26.670
There you are, Brent.

38:26.670 --> 38:28.130
What are you doing?

38:28.140 --> 38:31.140
Prom limo's waiting outside.
Whoo!

38:31.140 --> 38:32.540
I'm scared, Brock.

38:32.540 --> 38:34.470
I've never been with a girl
before...

38:34.480 --> 38:37.110
dancing-wise.

38:37.110 --> 38:40.410
You... You weren't
supposed to see this.

38:40.410 --> 38:43.150
Dancing is easy, Brent...

38:43.150 --> 38:44.680
If you have a plan, that is.

38:44.690 --> 38:46.420
Here.

38:46.420 --> 38:48.250
Let me show you.

38:51.390 --> 38:54.430
Follow the natural rhythm
of the music.

38:54.430 --> 38:57.160
Ease into her smooth curves.

38:57.160 --> 38:59.330
The body wants what it wants.

38:59.330 --> 39:00.570
I think I'm getting it!

39:00.570 --> 39:03.240
Dancing is
like tai-chi fighting.

39:03.240 --> 39:06.670
It's all about the transference
of energy.

39:06.670 --> 39:09.240
Just use her inertia
against her.

39:09.240 --> 39:10.310
That's it now.

39:10.310 --> 39:12.640
Whoooa!

39:12.650 --> 39:15.450
Oh.

39:15.450 --> 39:17.320
Oh, and first thing tomorrow,

39:17.320 --> 39:20.220
we're gonna return that
mannequin to T.J. Maxx, buddy.

39:20.220 --> 39:21.390
All right.

39:22.490 --> 39:24.690
Oh, Brock, what am I gonna do

39:24.690 --> 39:26.560
when you go off
to East Chico U.?

39:26.560 --> 39:28.790
Hey, you'll make some friends
of your own.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.060
But everybody sucks but us.

39:31.070 --> 39:32.660
Remember what I always say...

39:32.670 --> 39:34.100
When you face a foe

39:34.100 --> 39:37.200
you're afraid you can't defeat...
Murder!

39:37.200 --> 39:41.410
Aahhhhhhhhhhh!

39:41.410 --> 39:43.810
Aah! Aah! Aah!

39:43.810 --> 39:47.580
Aah!

39:47.580 --> 39:49.750
It's horrible!

39:49.750 --> 39:51.220
Someone killed!

39:51.220 --> 39:52.380
What's going on, Spike?

39:52.390 --> 39:53.490
Spike, tell us what happened!

39:53.490 --> 39:57.860
Someone killed... all the beer!

40:00.090 --> 40:03.200
This can... Shotgunned.

40:03.200 --> 40:04.800
Why?!

40:04.800 --> 40:07.530
Who would do such a thing?!

40:07.530 --> 40:09.370
Did you know
about his worst fear?

40:09.370 --> 40:10.400
Running out of beer?

40:10.400 --> 40:11.600
I think it's pretty clear.

40:13.170 --> 40:14.440
We'll get to the bottom of this.

40:14.440 --> 40:17.510
But right now,
beer run, pledge, now!

40:17.510 --> 40:18.410
I'll take the pledge.

40:18.410 --> 40:19.410
I was planning on getting

40:19.410 --> 40:20.810
some candid nature shots anyway.

40:20.810 --> 40:22.380
Yeah, yeah, sounds real great.

40:22.380 --> 40:24.620
Just one thing, pledge!

40:26.290 --> 40:29.390
Welcome to the beef box,
population you.

40:29.390 --> 40:32.120
This is where you live now,
in this thing.

40:32.130 --> 40:34.390
Lick the inside
for a 3-D experience,

40:34.390 --> 40:37.500
you little shit bag.

40:37.500 --> 40:39.630
All these bills!

40:39.630 --> 40:41.270
Aaaaah!

40:41.270 --> 40:42.270
Your vagina...

40:45.670 --> 40:48.610
Uh, you sure you don't want
me to call my dad,

40:48.610 --> 40:50.410
just have him come pick us up?
No!

40:50.410 --> 40:52.510
I've got to fix this on my own!

40:52.510 --> 40:55.280
- Plus, you murdered a guy!
- Hey!

40:55.280 --> 40:56.750
Stuff happens, Candace.

40:56.750 --> 40:58.750
That's the real world
we live in.

41:00.690 --> 41:02.690
Well, the wolves are coming.

41:02.690 --> 41:04.420
Let's spend the night here.

41:04.420 --> 41:06.590
Clean up the dead parts
in the morning.

41:16.500 --> 41:19.170
What's wrong?

41:19.170 --> 41:20.440
I'm sorry.

41:20.440 --> 41:24.210
I've just had a hard time
sleeping since...

41:24.210 --> 41:25.640
Since what?

41:25.650 --> 41:28.880
The Dude Bro
sophomore-year prank.

41:28.880 --> 41:30.680
Oh, yeah.

41:30.680 --> 41:31.880
The sophomore-year prank.

41:31.890 --> 41:34.590
I remember it well.

41:34.590 --> 41:36.290
Time's up, Sminkle.

41:36.290 --> 41:38.760
But you know what you can get
for another $200, right?

41:38.760 --> 41:41.360
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to, Fantasia?!

41:41.360 --> 41:42.890
I own this fucking town!

41:44.460 --> 41:47.830
I am eternal!

41:47.830 --> 41:50.670
Well, I don't really remember
the sophomore-year prank,

41:50.670 --> 41:53.970
but I'm sure
it was something awful.

41:53.970 --> 41:56.610
We're gonna get
those Dude Bros, Candace.

41:56.610 --> 41:58.880
I don't know if you've ever...

41:58.880 --> 42:01.810
bopped anybody
on the nose before, but, uh...

42:01.820 --> 42:05.280
it sure brings about a lot
of closure.

42:05.290 --> 42:07.850
- Yeah.
- Oh, um, I kind of sleep

42:07.850 --> 42:09.960
with my eyes open.

42:09.960 --> 42:11.420
It's just a thing.

42:11.430 --> 42:12.620
It's okay.

42:12.630 --> 42:14.890
Hang in there, partner.

42:14.900 --> 42:18.730
Good night.

42:22.940 --> 42:24.840
Sminkle?

42:42.890 --> 42:45.320
Z.Q., I can't see a thing
in this thing.

42:45.330 --> 42:47.730
Life is tough in the beef box,
pledge.

42:47.730 --> 42:49.360
You know,
you can get out of that box

42:49.360 --> 42:51.330
if you just man up and beef.

42:51.330 --> 42:52.800
I beefed on day five.

42:52.800 --> 42:55.500
Spike,
he beefed like every hour.

42:55.500 --> 42:57.370
It's like,
"Spike, slow your roll, man.

42:57.370 --> 43:00.270
Don't beef so fast."
He wouldn't listen.

43:00.270 --> 43:03.280
Turbeaux, he beefed
before he even got in there.

43:03.280 --> 43:04.440
Dude's a machine.

43:04.440 --> 43:05.840
Those guys seem pretty wild.

43:05.850 --> 43:08.380
So fucking wild.

43:08.380 --> 43:10.320
Can I tell you something, Z.Q.,

43:10.320 --> 43:11.820
something I haven't told anyone?

43:11.820 --> 43:13.650
Sure, Sizzler.

43:13.650 --> 43:16.690
Sometimes, I think those guys
don't respect me.

43:16.690 --> 43:19.290
And I'll never be a Delta Bi

43:19.290 --> 43:21.730
even if I get
out of this cold beef box.

43:21.730 --> 43:23.900
Delta Bis have to have
confidence.

43:23.900 --> 43:25.660
In there,
you have to think on your feet,

43:25.670 --> 43:27.670
'cause it's all you've got.

43:27.670 --> 43:31.000
My advice, if you're
getting cold, just beef.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.570
Get a good steam going.
I don't want to beef.

43:33.570 --> 43:35.810
Let go of your fears and beef.

43:35.810 --> 43:37.480
My fear is beef!

43:37.480 --> 43:40.950
And pork and chicken
and all that gross stuff!

43:40.950 --> 43:42.610
No one respects that.

43:42.620 --> 43:43.980
I'll never fit in here.

43:43.980 --> 43:45.420
Don't get cranky with me,
pledge!

43:45.420 --> 43:46.920
Just because I like you

43:46.920 --> 43:49.200
doesn't mean you're getting
out of that box early.

43:51.490 --> 43:53.090
You, uh... you hungry?

43:55.030 --> 43:59.330
You know, through my lens,
I see the souls of my bros.

43:59.330 --> 44:01.700
I've seen your inner truth.

44:01.700 --> 44:03.440
You've got beef in you.

44:03.440 --> 44:04.770
I'm not gonna let you quit.

44:04.770 --> 44:06.570
You have too much potential.

44:58.120 --> 45:01.390
Oh, Brock,
how am I supposed to avenge you

45:01.400 --> 45:04.860
if I can't find
any stupid clues?

45:05.660 --> 45:08.070
Anyway, good to see you, like...

45:09.570 --> 45:10.970
Whoa.

45:21.780 --> 45:23.850
Oh!

45:23.850 --> 45:25.850
Clues!

45:26.850 --> 45:27.850
<i>Oh, no!</i>

45:31.460 --> 45:33.930
Can you hold my hair back, bro?

45:36.060 --> 45:38.060
Clues!

45:41.100 --> 45:42.570
Brock.

45:42.570 --> 45:44.900
Is that you, Brock?

45:48.770 --> 45:50.710
- Yes.
- Strange.

45:50.710 --> 45:55.650
I have memories
of your corpse, a flagpole...

45:55.650 --> 45:56.650
your anus.

45:57.920 --> 45:59.620
Must have been a dream.

45:59.620 --> 46:00.850
I don't dream.

46:00.850 --> 46:02.850
You should try it. It's fun.

46:02.860 --> 46:05.190
You can fly,
you can fuck whatever you want.

46:05.190 --> 46:07.030
It's great.

46:07.030 --> 46:09.690
What's that on your face, Brock?

46:09.700 --> 46:11.900
It's chocolate.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.100
I'm saving it for later.

46:16.100 --> 46:17.140
Did you miss your brother?

46:17.140 --> 46:19.100
Brent?

46:19.110 --> 46:22.540
No, he... he's a loser.

46:24.580 --> 46:26.080
Peculiar.

46:26.080 --> 46:27.950
You used to cry every night

46:27.950 --> 46:32.180
for having pushed him away
to keep him safe from this...

46:32.190 --> 46:33.750
nightmare.

46:35.750 --> 46:37.720
Dance with me, Brock.

46:37.720 --> 46:40.090
Dance with me,
just like we did in 1986

46:40.090 --> 46:41.960
at the rhythm and blues mixer.

46:41.960 --> 46:43.900
That's when the second string
of murders started happening!

46:43.900 --> 46:45.900
Do you remember... Dance now.

46:45.900 --> 46:48.230
- But my investigation...
- Now we dance.

47:08.190 --> 47:09.550
Catch me.

47:11.790 --> 47:13.190
Whoa!

47:13.190 --> 47:15.030
Heavy!

47:15.030 --> 47:16.190
Ohh!

47:16.200 --> 47:18.660
Oh, no! Oh, no.

47:18.670 --> 47:20.130
No, no, no, no, no. Come on.

47:20.130 --> 47:22.100
Sam... Samzy?

47:22.100 --> 47:25.170
You're okay! You're okay, Samzy!

47:25.170 --> 47:28.910
Heavy! Come on! Come on!

47:28.910 --> 47:30.210
Think, Brent. Think, Brent.

47:30.210 --> 47:31.910
Everybody likes you.
You're a good guy.

47:31.910 --> 47:33.950
They'll believe you.
Samzy, Samzy...

47:33.950 --> 47:35.850
Oh, my God!

47:37.950 --> 47:41.090
I see what's going on here.

47:41.090 --> 47:43.820
He's wasted on beer!

47:43.820 --> 47:46.090
You lied to me!

47:46.090 --> 47:48.160
Aah!

47:51.660 --> 47:53.000
This coffee's so lame.

47:53.000 --> 47:56.600
- Aah!
- Did somebody say orange juice?

47:56.600 --> 47:58.600
Oh, oh, oh God!

47:58.610 --> 48:00.170
The beer!

48:00.170 --> 48:02.610
Oh, God! Oh, God!

48:02.610 --> 48:04.280
Oh, fuck you, tree! No!

48:04.280 --> 48:08.980
Oh, beer! No! No!

48:08.980 --> 48:11.220
Oh, God, no! Oh, no!

48:11.220 --> 48:12.320
Aah!

48:18.820 --> 48:21.130
Oh, it can't be!

48:21.130 --> 48:23.630
Oh, beer!

48:23.630 --> 48:26.100
Beer!

48:26.100 --> 48:27.700
Oh, beer!

48:27.700 --> 48:30.000
Oh!

48:30.000 --> 48:34.010
Oh, it's still cold!

48:34.010 --> 48:36.110
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!

48:36.110 --> 48:37.780
Oh!

48:37.780 --> 48:41.850
Oh, perfect!
Now I just need the tap.

48:42.350 --> 48:45.620
Where's the... Where's the tap?!

49:16.350 --> 49:18.720
It's all head.

49:25.820 --> 49:27.930
So, Hamlet's not in the play.

49:27.930 --> 49:30.060
No, he's in it.
It's just not about him.

49:30.060 --> 49:31.700
It's about these two
side characters

49:31.700 --> 49:32.900
that nobody
thought were important.

49:32.900 --> 49:35.200
Seems unnecessarily pretentious.

49:38.200 --> 49:40.140
What?! Aah!

49:40.140 --> 49:41.670
Boom!

49:41.680 --> 49:43.370
Oh, yeah!

49:47.150 --> 49:48.810
All right, pledge.

49:48.820 --> 49:50.080
You're in the final stretch

49:50.080 --> 49:52.280
of the Delta Bi biannual
bicep gauntlet.

49:52.290 --> 49:54.120
You've lost
to pretty much every bro here.

49:54.120 --> 49:55.320
Now you're gonna face me.

49:55.320 --> 49:56.320
And if you lose,

49:56.320 --> 49:57.820
you're going in the barrel,

49:57.820 --> 49:58.920
and I'm gonna read
what you've been writing

49:58.930 --> 50:00.790
in that stupid diary of yours!

50:00.790 --> 50:02.330
My journal.

50:02.330 --> 50:04.130
All right.

50:04.130 --> 50:05.700
Kick his ass.

50:05.700 --> 50:07.330
3,<i> tres,</i> go!

50:07.330 --> 50:12.840
I already know
what today's entry's gonna be.

50:12.840 --> 50:14.070
"Dear Diary, I lost,

50:14.070 --> 50:15.940
"and now I'm in a barrel."
- No.

50:15.940 --> 50:16.970
- Yeah!
- No.

50:16.980 --> 50:18.280
- Yeah!
- Please.

50:18.280 --> 50:20.140
- "Please" what?
- Please don't beat me!

50:20.150 --> 50:21.250
Okay. Maybe.

50:21.250 --> 50:23.250
- Just kidding.
- Ohh!

50:23.250 --> 50:25.380
Aah!

50:25.390 --> 50:27.320
- Yeah!
- Yay!

50:27.320 --> 50:28.850
- Hey, guys!
- Aww!

50:28.860 --> 50:31.090
Babe, what the fuck
are you doing here?!

50:31.090 --> 50:32.460
Yeah! What the fuck, Samantha?!

50:32.460 --> 50:33.930
What the fuck, Todd?!

50:33.930 --> 50:35.130
You can't let
your girlfriend come!

50:35.130 --> 50:36.130
You know the rules!

50:36.130 --> 50:37.300
I didn't let her come!

50:37.300 --> 50:38.260
What?!

50:38.260 --> 50:40.100
Babe, you can't be here.

50:40.100 --> 50:42.330
I know you guys like beer,
so I brought beer

50:42.340 --> 50:44.140
so you guys like me. Right?

50:44.140 --> 50:47.210
We can like beer without having
to like you, Samantha.

50:47.210 --> 50:49.270
- Samzy, get the beer!
- Sorry.

50:49.280 --> 50:52.210
- See? Now we hate her.
- Yeah, fuck her.

50:52.210 --> 50:54.380
- Don't we have an extra room?
- Oh, yeah.

50:54.380 --> 50:55.480
We got all the room
in the world.

50:55.480 --> 50:57.180
It's called outside!

50:57.180 --> 50:59.980
The rules do state
that during bicep bi-annuals,

50:59.990 --> 51:03.890
all females
have to stay outside...

51:03.890 --> 51:05.860
where there is more room.

51:05.860 --> 51:07.160
But I brought beer,

51:07.160 --> 51:09.160
and you guys
stole my motor home!

51:09.160 --> 51:11.060
Todd, you broke the rules.
You got to go with her.

51:11.060 --> 51:12.760
You can't let
me go outside with her!

51:12.770 --> 51:15.300
She's gonna try
and take my virginity.

51:15.300 --> 51:17.240
No, I would never.

51:17.240 --> 51:18.800
If I remember correctly,

51:18.810 --> 51:22.540
and I do, there's a tent
in the shed out back.

51:22.540 --> 51:25.040
Yep, there's a tent in the shed.

51:25.040 --> 51:26.780
The tent's located in the shed.

51:26.780 --> 51:28.880
That's where the tent is.
In the shed.

51:28.880 --> 51:31.220
Tent's in the shed.
Tent's in the shed.

51:31.220 --> 51:32.780
Tent's in the shed.

51:32.790 --> 51:33.890
No!

51:33.890 --> 51:35.150
What's it gonna be?

51:35.160 --> 51:37.890
Are you a Delta Bi
or a Samantha guy?

51:41.160 --> 51:43.060
What do you think?

51:50.470 --> 51:52.070
Tent's in the shed.

51:55.540 --> 51:58.940
Looks like you get a stay
of execution, pledge.

52:06.020 --> 52:08.150
I don't even want
to look at you right now!

52:08.150 --> 52:14.530
You've ruined
my l-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-ife!

52:14.530 --> 52:16.890
We're getting this tent,
and we're going to bed!

52:16.900 --> 52:18.600
That's it!

52:21.370 --> 52:23.370
Oh, that's fine! That's fine.

52:23.370 --> 52:24.440
- Babe...
- We can just go to bed.

52:24.440 --> 52:25.940
Yeah, I'm tired.

52:25.940 --> 52:27.210
I didn't mean to get
you kicked out.

52:27.210 --> 52:28.510
- Babe...
- I am so sorry

52:28.510 --> 52:30.310
that I'm a girl, baby.
You should be!

52:30.310 --> 52:31.940
Who needs the Delta Bis?

52:31.950 --> 52:33.540
I think they're just jealous
of you anyway.

52:33.550 --> 52:35.580
Babe, babe!

52:35.580 --> 52:37.280
Yeah, you are the smartest bro
in the frat.

52:37.280 --> 52:40.250
I mean, you've got career
prospects, healthy gums,

52:40.250 --> 52:42.090
I mean, amazing bone structure.
Stop. Your hands are cold.

52:42.090 --> 52:43.550
- That tickles.
- Your body is

52:43.560 --> 52:45.960
so fucking jacked and fertile!

52:45.960 --> 52:49.160
It's like your sperm count must
be in the billions or something.

52:49.160 --> 52:51.230
Oh, oh!

52:51.230 --> 52:52.860
Babe... I mean, those Delta Bis

52:52.870 --> 52:56.270
should be getting on their knees
to worship you.

52:56.270 --> 52:57.940
Tell me more about my bros.

52:57.940 --> 52:59.900
Oh. Found it.

53:01.340 --> 53:03.880
Oh.

53:03.880 --> 53:05.580
Oh, Samantha.

53:05.580 --> 53:06.980
Oh, baby.

53:06.980 --> 53:08.410
- Stay on target.
- Oh, Sam.

53:08.410 --> 53:10.250
Eye on the prize!

53:10.250 --> 53:11.920
These air holes you poked in
the condom aren't working, babe.

53:11.920 --> 53:13.120
No, stay the course!

53:13.120 --> 53:14.890
Little Todd still can't breathe.

53:14.890 --> 53:17.460
He looks like a...
A dude jammed into something.

53:17.460 --> 53:19.290
It's usually hard.

53:19.290 --> 53:20.890
It normally is!

53:20.890 --> 53:22.230
Does this help?

53:22.230 --> 53:24.900
- Yeah. Yeah, that's better.
- Okay, good.

53:24.900 --> 53:26.660
- Okay.
- You've got this, Todd!

53:26.670 --> 53:28.330
You are in the zone!

53:28.330 --> 53:30.530
You are in the home stretch!
Please!

53:30.540 --> 53:32.820
- You are killing it back there!
- Don't look at me!

53:35.210 --> 53:38.540
Ahh, I'm having sex.

53:38.540 --> 53:41.280
Don't you quit now, boy!
Don't you quit now!

53:41.280 --> 53:42.680
Now... now I lost it.

53:42.680 --> 53:45.080
Put your Delta Bi seed in me!

53:45.080 --> 53:46.380
My seed?!

53:46.390 --> 53:48.320
Aah!

53:57.230 --> 53:59.400
Thank you, Toddy.

54:02.040 --> 54:03.130
Mm.

54:05.170 --> 54:06.970
Should've pulled out.

54:12.150 --> 54:13.540
How much further, Z.Q.?

54:13.550 --> 54:16.050
Our journey will end
when it ends, Sizzler.

54:16.050 --> 54:17.980
And once you beef,
a whole new journey

54:17.980 --> 54:19.050
begins for you.

54:19.050 --> 54:21.320
Oh!

54:21.320 --> 54:24.060
- What's that?!
- Tree noises.

54:26.090 --> 54:27.660
Aah!

54:33.370 --> 54:35.000
Oh. Oh, no!

54:35.000 --> 54:37.370
- Oh!
- Z.Q., are you okay?!

54:37.370 --> 54:39.070
No! I'm not okay!

54:39.070 --> 54:40.670
Kick my camera
in my general direction!

54:40.670 --> 54:42.370
This is an incredible scene!

54:42.380 --> 54:44.080
- I'm getting out of this thing.
- No!

54:44.080 --> 54:45.140
But I could save you! I just

54:45.140 --> 54:46.240
have to get out of this box!

54:46.250 --> 54:49.080
Not until you beef! Sizzler!

54:52.620 --> 54:55.150
I'm trapped! I'm trapped!

54:56.490 --> 54:59.060
No! Ha ha! I'm on my way!

54:59.060 --> 55:00.220
I have a rope!

55:00.230 --> 55:01.130
- Hang tight, Sizzler!
- Aah!

55:01.130 --> 55:03.630
Aah!

55:06.470 --> 55:09.230
Amazing!

55:11.540 --> 55:13.300
Rainin' men.

55:14.270 --> 55:17.270
Come on, Got to beef!

55:17.280 --> 55:18.540
Got to beef!

55:18.540 --> 55:22.050
I got to beef! Aaah!

55:22.050 --> 55:28.590
Aaah!

55:28.590 --> 55:31.560
And the, uh, number-one reason

55:31.560 --> 55:37.060
why cops just can't catch
a break, uh...

55:37.060 --> 55:38.330
My dad beat me,

55:38.330 --> 55:41.030
and now I sleep with my eyes
open!

55:42.400 --> 55:43.470
Boo!

55:43.470 --> 55:44.600
God! No!

55:44.600 --> 55:46.600
You can tell he's a virgin!

55:46.610 --> 55:52.240
Oranges! Oranges!
Get away from me!

55:52.250 --> 55:54.310
Sminkle! Wake up!

55:54.310 --> 55:56.110
Number 6, please don't kill me!

55:56.120 --> 55:58.250
It's just a dream!
We've got to move this car,

55:58.250 --> 55:59.720
and I can't do it on my own.

55:59.720 --> 56:02.320
- I need your muscles.
- Oh.

56:02.320 --> 56:04.790
Well, why didn't you say so?

56:04.790 --> 56:07.560
All I need is a hearty breakfast
and, uh...

56:07.560 --> 56:09.230
Hey.

56:09.230 --> 56:12.200
The wolves cleaned up
all the deadness.

56:12.200 --> 56:15.400
And they filled up the tires.

56:15.400 --> 56:18.740
Boy... those wolves are...

56:21.210 --> 56:24.510
...getting pretty smart.

56:24.510 --> 56:26.610
Just push, damn it!

56:26.610 --> 56:28.210
Brace yourself,

56:28.210 --> 56:31.620
'cause you just bought
yourself a one-way ticket

56:31.620 --> 56:34.820
to the motherfucking gun show!

56:37.390 --> 56:42.730
Fu... Havin' a good time
at the gun show!

56:42.730 --> 56:45.360
Havin' a good...

56:45.360 --> 56:49.230
Aah! Oh, those Dream Bros
were right...

56:49.240 --> 56:52.370
I can't do anything right.

56:52.370 --> 56:56.240
Look, here are the top 10
reasons why Sminkle is great.

56:56.240 --> 56:59.540
10, he greets every day
with a smile.

56:59.550 --> 57:02.180
9, he wants to help children.

57:02.180 --> 57:04.380
I want to bang children!

57:04.380 --> 57:07.380
8, he wants to bang
children's minds.

57:07.390 --> 57:09.820
No, it's not as catchy.
No, it's too long.

57:09.820 --> 57:11.590
It's too thought-out.
It's too involved.

57:11.590 --> 57:13.760
7, he wants to bang children.

57:13.760 --> 57:16.630
- Bang 'em good.
- Don't give up, Sminkle.

57:16.630 --> 57:18.330
We got to get you
to the lake house

57:18.330 --> 57:20.560
so that you can solve
Chico's orange crisis!

57:20.570 --> 57:24.200
Virgin strength!

57:24.200 --> 57:27.540
Ah! 6, he's asleep right now

57:27.540 --> 57:28.440
yet still somehow pushing.

57:28.440 --> 57:33.780
Uh... I, uh... 2,
he's awake right now,

57:33.780 --> 57:35.150
and that's a good thing!

57:37.220 --> 57:41.520
1, he probably
doesn't deserve to die.

57:43.390 --> 57:45.360
- Yes!
- Yes!

57:45.360 --> 57:46.860
Oh, my God! Yes, yes, yes, yes!

57:46.860 --> 57:47.890
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

57:54.830 --> 57:56.400
Oh, no.

58:15.590 --> 58:17.220
Oh, no. I forgot my keys!

58:17.220 --> 58:18.560
Aah!

58:18.560 --> 58:20.660
Every year,
thousands of idiots are...

58:30.640 --> 58:32.570
Guys!

58:48.750 --> 58:50.790
Hey, friend, come on in.

58:50.790 --> 58:52.760
It's nice, and it's warm.

58:52.760 --> 58:55.730
Quit remembering your dead
brother and jump in the water.

58:55.730 --> 58:57.230
Brent, come on, man!

58:57.230 --> 58:58.760
You can do it! Brent!

58:58.760 --> 59:00.360
Oh, take off that shirt.

59:00.370 --> 59:02.530
You'll love it!

59:02.540 --> 59:04.440
Come on in, bro.
Get in the water.

59:04.440 --> 59:06.770
- In the water!
- It's so wet!

59:06.770 --> 59:08.240
Yay!

59:08.240 --> 59:09.440
You did it!

59:09.440 --> 59:11.710
Congrats, buddy.

59:11.710 --> 59:13.510
We're having such a good time.

59:13.510 --> 59:16.610
- Aren't we, Brent?
- Yeah.

59:16.620 --> 59:18.780
I guess we are.

59:18.780 --> 59:20.380
Yeah!

59:20.390 --> 59:21.490
Told you so.

59:21.490 --> 59:23.290
Nice catch.

59:23.290 --> 59:24.850
- Whoa!
- Oh, no!

59:26.690 --> 59:27.930
Daddy, no, don't go.

59:27.930 --> 59:29.430
I'm sorry I'm a girl.

59:29.430 --> 59:30.860
Daddy, no! No!

59:30.860 --> 59:32.800
No, I promise I'll have
you a grandson.

59:32.800 --> 59:34.600
It'll make it all better! Wait.

59:34.600 --> 59:36.000
What's that, daddy?

59:36.000 --> 59:38.800
You... you'll be right back?
Oh, okay.

59:38.800 --> 59:40.900
I'll wait here on the stoop
for you.

59:40.910 --> 59:42.540
Bye.

59:42.540 --> 59:44.940
Mm.

59:44.940 --> 59:46.810
Oh, Todd,
I had the most wonderful...

59:46.810 --> 59:49.480
Aah! Aaaaaah!

59:53.650 --> 59:55.750
Whoo! Yeah!

59:55.760 --> 59:57.420
- Shh!
- Oh!

59:57.420 --> 59:59.690
Look, guys, Z.Q.'s overcome
his fear of heights!

59:59.690 --> 01:00:00.890
Wow!

01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:24.540
Oh, my God! Torsos!

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:27.380
Hey! Todd is dead! Help me!

01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:37.920
So, Z.Q.'s dead?

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:40.060
Samantha shows up
covered in blood?

01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:42.930
I knew she couldn't be trusted,
but she's a killer!

01:01:42.930 --> 01:01:45.060
Please let me in!

01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:47.800
I just got punched in the face,
and my boyfriend's dead!

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:50.930
This weekend is not going at all
how I planned it.

01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:52.740
Brent, you get the door.

01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:55.010
Samzy, you played ball
in college, right?

01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:57.810
Starting pitcher,
East Chico Rapiers.

01:01:57.810 --> 01:01:58.810
Batter's up, bro.

01:01:58.810 --> 01:01:59.940
Guys, I don't know...

01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:01.450
We're killing the killer!

01:02:01.450 --> 01:02:04.150
It's just like old times, Brock!
Remember?

01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:06.420
Go, Rapiers!

01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:07.650
Please!

01:02:07.650 --> 01:02:09.090
Just move.

01:02:09.090 --> 01:02:11.490
Your brother's more Rapier
than you'll ever be.

01:02:11.490 --> 01:02:13.460
Please let me in!

01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:15.590
- Who is it?
- It's Samantha!

01:02:15.590 --> 01:02:17.490
Samantha who?

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:19.530
Samantha Samantha! Let me in!

01:02:19.530 --> 01:02:20.600
I'm Todd's girlfriend!

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.130
I've tried to bang all of you!

01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:24.640
Todd doesn't have a girlfriend.

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.600
He's still discovering himself.

01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:28.210
Just let me in.

01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:30.570
Okay.

01:02:33.110 --> 01:02:34.450
Ohh!

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:36.650
Go, Rapiers!

01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:39.120
Wait a minute.
Samantha couldn't be Motherface.

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:41.850
Todd told me she was
on that Booze Cruise in Cabo

01:02:41.850 --> 01:02:43.150
when Brock died.

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:45.460
Guys, Samantha
couldn't be Motherface.

01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:47.020
Todd told me she was
on that Booze Cruise

01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:48.460
in Cabo when Brock died.

01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:49.730
Whoa!

01:02:49.730 --> 01:02:51.600
Motherface? Motherface is dead!

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:52.900
We killed her twice,
Brock, remember?

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:54.600
Rememb... Br-Br-Broc... Broc...

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:57.500
Broc... Broc... Broc...
Broc... Broc...

01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:58.870
Ba-gawk! She's dead.

01:02:58.870 --> 01:03:00.700
Motherface is dead. She's dead.

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:04.140
But Samantha is here, alive,
covered in blood!

01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:05.880
We're all covered in blood!

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:08.250
Are you guys daft or something?!

01:03:08.250 --> 01:03:10.550
Motherface is back!

01:03:10.550 --> 01:03:13.520
She killed Todd,
she killed Z.Q.,

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:15.690
and she killed my brother,
Brock!

01:03:15.690 --> 01:03:17.120
Samzy, throw another bat at him.

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:18.760
- I'm out of bats.
- Fine.

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:21.560
I'll defeat him using good looks
and logic.

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:24.530
You are stu-pid.

01:03:24.530 --> 01:03:25.830
Brock, you always had a plan

01:03:25.830 --> 01:03:26.900
when these kinds of things
happened.

01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:27.900
Brock, What's the plan?

01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:29.670
Don't drag Brock into this!

01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:32.740
Don't tell him
where to drag my dead brother!

01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:35.840
I already lost him once
when he joined the Delta Bis,

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:39.180
and then you let him get
murdered by Motherface

01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:40.940
right under your noses!

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:43.010
That's fine. You know what?

01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:44.110
I'm rescinding your pledge.

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:46.150
Oh, no!

01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:48.020
I don't care!

01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:49.650
I'm not even here to pledge!

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:51.150
I'm here for Brock...

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:54.960
To find out what happened to him
and avenge his death,

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:58.800
not to bro out with you dudes!

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:01.530
- You lied to us.
- No.

01:04:01.530 --> 01:04:02.700
No, no, no, no, no.

01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:05.270
I trusted you!

01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:08.710
Who are you?!

01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:11.810
New plan... time to beat
the shit out of

01:04:11.810 --> 01:04:13.940
dead Brock's living brother,
Brent.

01:04:15.250 --> 01:04:17.950
- Brock has a brother?
- I told you, Samzy.

01:04:17.950 --> 01:04:19.950
- God damn it.
- Oh, my God!

01:04:19.950 --> 01:04:21.950
You're little Brent Chirino!

01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:24.820
I have heard so much about you.

01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:26.190
You can... Wow. Okay.

01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:28.590
So you can understand
how meeting someone

01:04:28.590 --> 01:04:30.790
that looks exactly like somebody
that you thought was dead

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:33.660
would be exceptionally
confusing.

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:39.570
What the hell are you doing
out of the beef box, pledge?!

01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:45.340
<i>Amazing!</i>

01:04:47.810 --> 01:04:48.850
<i>Rainin' men.</i>

01:04:48.850 --> 01:04:50.350
Oh, God... Z.Q.

01:04:50.350 --> 01:04:51.880
<i>- Aah!</i>
- There!

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:54.250
That's where I beefed.

01:04:54.250 --> 01:04:56.150
Pause the tape.

01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:00.920
Enhance.

01:05:00.930 --> 01:05:04.360
I said enhance, damn you!

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:07.630
Now squint.

01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:08.730
Motherface!

01:05:08.730 --> 01:05:10.000
- Who?
- I knew it.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.030
- Yes.
- Whoa.

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:13.340
It's true.

01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:14.870
She's back.

01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:16.370
But I've been investigating,

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:20.240
and I think I know who she is
and how to stop her.

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:22.250
I thought I could do it alone.

01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:23.980
But I need you.

01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:27.680
You're the only bros
I have left.

01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:32.620
Step aside,
Brock's identical twin brother.

01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:35.130
Let a real Delta Bi handle this.

01:05:35.130 --> 01:05:38.400
You see, after surviving
two party massacres myself,

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:43.070
I grew weary of relying
on Brock's plans to save us all.

01:05:43.070 --> 01:05:46.340
To wit, I created an identical
robot duplicate of myself

01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:51.110
for one, singular purpose...
To kill Motherface.

01:05:51.110 --> 01:05:54.910
- Weird.
- It's up in the attic.

01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:58.780
Oh! That's it!

01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:00.180
Robot!

01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:02.020
In the attic.

01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:04.020
- Oh!
- Okay.

01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:07.760
Well, with that in mind,
you bros just kick your feet up

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:10.060
and let me and Robo-Samzy
take care of this one.

01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:12.180
- I don't know if you should...
- Just, uh...

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:18.070
That's odd. There appears to be
some kind of malfunction.

01:06:18.070 --> 01:06:20.200
I'll just do a quick check...
No! No!

01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:23.670
I was just thinking, maybe,
if that doesn't work,

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:26.080
then we should have a plan B.

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:28.410
I got this one.

01:06:28.410 --> 01:06:31.080
Yeah, there he goes.

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:33.880
Secret door open.

01:06:33.890 --> 01:06:36.450
And there he's going.

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:38.990
- Oh, Jesus.
- Robo-Samzy?

01:06:38.990 --> 01:06:40.160
Robo-Samzy?!

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:42.230
Oh, no! Robo-Samzy!

01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:44.960
You didn't try to dance,
did you?!

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:48.330
You beautiful fool!
Who did this to you?!

01:06:48.330 --> 01:06:51.470
It was... Bro...

01:06:56.110 --> 01:06:58.010
What is going on?!

01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:08.750
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:10.390
I don't like that guy.

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:14.120
Aah! Aah!

01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:20.130
What is happening?!

01:07:20.130 --> 01:07:21.930
I had a plan this time!

01:07:21.930 --> 01:07:23.430
I watched you die!

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:24.440
Twice!

01:07:28.170 --> 01:07:29.170
Hmm?

01:07:33.810 --> 01:07:35.780
Why are you hitting
yourself, huh?

01:07:39.150 --> 01:07:41.420
What are you...
I'm a little bitch!

01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:44.350
I'm a little bitch!

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:46.190
I'm a little bitch, bitch,
bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch,

01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:48.460
bitch, bitch, bitch,
bitch, bitch, bitch!

01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:49.790
You killed my mother.

01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:53.130
And my sister.

01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:57.870
You at least
deserve a tongue-lashing.

01:07:57.870 --> 01:08:03.340
Aah! Aah!

01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:05.410
Aah!

01:08:15.450 --> 01:08:18.189
What? No tongue?

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:42.979
Call now,
and we'll send you a second...

01:08:42.979 --> 01:08:45.180
Are you bored of the same...

01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:47.950
No, no. Please. Please, God.

01:08:47.950 --> 01:08:49.250
Please. Oh, no.

01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:50.850
Oh, God, Candace.

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:01.460
Oh, God!

01:09:06.370 --> 01:09:08.310
Virgin... tears.

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:09.340
Aah.

01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:11.410
Ugh.

01:09:11.410 --> 01:09:13.340
Ew.

01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:16.180
- You saved my life.
- Well, yeah, you big dummy.

01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:18.350
I mean, you know, honestly,
this is the longest time

01:09:18.350 --> 01:09:19.620
I've ever spent
with another person,

01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:21.279
and I've never really
had a friend,

01:09:21.290 --> 01:09:22.590
and no one's ever listened
to my top 10 lists before

01:09:22.590 --> 01:09:24.050
or had such pretty hair,

01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:25.390
and when we were flying through
the air,

01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:27.120
I really thought we
had a moment there,

01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:28.490
and I honestly thought I could
spend the rest of my life

01:09:28.490 --> 01:09:30.189
flying through the air
next to this person!

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:31.229
And I was honestly glad
we didn't wear seat belts!

01:09:31.229 --> 01:09:32.430
You know, fuck safety!

01:09:32.430 --> 01:09:34.300
And I really thought
that I lost you!

01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:35.470
Oh, Sminkle.

01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:38.270
Oh, Candace.

01:09:38.270 --> 01:09:39.540
I'm sorry.

01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:40.939
There's another guy,
isn't there.

01:09:40.939 --> 01:09:42.109
Gosh darn it. I should've known.

01:09:42.109 --> 01:09:44.609
Classic Candace.

01:09:44.609 --> 01:09:47.109
Nice work, officer.

01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:57.220
Hey.

01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:59.920
Sorry I abandoned
you back there.

01:09:59.930 --> 01:10:01.390
That's okay, daddy...

01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:03.930
- I mean, Brent.
- Brent.

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:08.530
I'm cold.

01:10:23.610 --> 01:10:25.250
Are we gonna die, Brent?

01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:38.130
Hey, Sizzler, great job.

01:10:38.130 --> 01:10:40.160
Why don't you go fuck off
for a sec, all right?

01:10:40.170 --> 01:10:43.570
Sure. I'll go get
my organic veggies upstairs.

01:10:43.570 --> 01:10:45.650
Grab a big bag of dicks.
I don't care.

01:10:47.970 --> 01:10:50.370
Hey.

01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:52.210
Brock meant a lot to me.

01:10:52.210 --> 01:10:55.580
And I thought, like a idiot,

01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:57.950
that maybe you'd be like him,

01:10:57.950 --> 01:10:59.550
and we could go on
like nothing ever happened.

01:10:59.550 --> 01:11:02.050
But something did happen.

01:11:02.050 --> 01:11:03.120
You lied to me!

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:04.350
Turbeaux, you can trust me.

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.190
- We're in this together.
- No!

01:11:06.190 --> 01:11:08.360
Brock planned all my workouts
for me!

01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:10.630
We were supposed to do traps
and lats the day he died!

01:11:10.630 --> 01:11:12.460
Now look at me!

01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:16.100
If we do 10 sets of 20 reps
on the lat pull-down machine,

01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:19.500
I swear, we will sculpt you
the V-taper of your dreams.

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:21.240
You lied to me!

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:22.970
I swear,
I will never lie to you again.

01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:24.310
What if it's my birthday?

01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:26.180
You take me
to a quiet little bistro dinner.

01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:27.510
Nothing too fancy?

01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:30.080
And then you act
like you "forgot your keys."

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:31.180
Then the lights go out.

01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:32.620
Who turned out the lights?

01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:34.320
Then the lights go back on.

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:35.690
All my friends are there.

01:11:35.690 --> 01:11:37.220
And you know what it is?

01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:40.520
It's a goddamn surprise
birthday party!

01:11:40.530 --> 01:11:44.530
Garcon, bring out the fucking
raspberry brown butter torte

01:11:44.530 --> 01:11:48.030
that reads "Happy 23rd B-Day,
Turbeaux!"

01:11:48.030 --> 01:11:50.530
Love your lying friend,

01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:53.100
"the sack of shit
that he is, Brent!"

01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:55.710
I swear, I will ruin
every surprise party

01:11:55.710 --> 01:11:58.010
that anyone ever throws you!

01:11:58.010 --> 01:11:59.210
But I love surprises!

01:11:59.210 --> 01:12:00.480
What's your problem, man?!

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:03.080
I have a hairy dick!

01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:09.550
Wh-what?

01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:15.030
You know how I hate
little baby dogs

01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:17.390
and their little
hairy baby dog dicks?

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:18.800
Yeah, I guess, yeah.

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:22.330
When I look at
a little baby dog, Brent...

01:12:22.330 --> 01:12:25.400
I see the parts of me
that I hate!

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:28.770
I hate my little
hairy baby dog dick!

01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:31.570
That's cool, man.

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:34.480
That's... That's normal...

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:38.580
for us... to have... problems...

01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:42.490
with our... with our dicks.

01:12:42.490 --> 01:12:43.650
Really?

01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:46.820
Sure.

01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:49.560
All right.

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:54.200
Well, me and my fuzz
rod, we're gonna...

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:58.570
go down to the cellar
and... get some more wood.

01:13:00.570 --> 01:13:02.710
All right. Good talk.

01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:13.120
What?

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:15.620
Who's been
pillaging my veg stash?!

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:19.490
What am I gonna eat?

01:13:36.710 --> 01:13:40.510
Aww. You're just hungry.
That's cool.

01:13:40.510 --> 01:13:43.380
What's mine is yours,
rabbit friend.

01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:53.260
No, I can't! I'm a vegetarian!

01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:54.460
Meat upsets my stom...

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:03.730
Oh, n-o-o-o-o!

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:37.630
All right!

01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:48.340
One bullet? Cool.

01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:50.880
Oh!

01:14:56.850 --> 01:14:58.790
I'm not afraid of you.

01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:16.910
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:18.440
I'm a puppet!

01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:20.340
Aah!

01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:21.350
Oh, my God!

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:22.550
Ohh! Ohh!

01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:25.250
I hate my little
hairy baby dog dick!

01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:27.450
I have a hairy dick!

01:15:27.450 --> 01:15:29.490
Baby hairy dick!

01:15:29.490 --> 01:15:32.790
I hate my little
hairy baby dog dick!

01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:35.260
I have a hairy dick!

01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:43.570
You're so small!

01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:47.400
- What was that?
- Turbeaux's dead.

01:15:47.410 --> 01:15:48.970
And Sizzler?

01:15:48.970 --> 01:15:51.270
Honestly,
I forgot who Sizzler was,

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:53.980
but I should play it cool.

01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:56.250
Let's split up and look for him.

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:04.020
Sizzler?

01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:11.630
Sizzler?

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:20.800
Sizzler?

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:25.780
Sizzler?

01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:29.550
Sizzler?

01:16:29.550 --> 01:16:32.050
Oh! Sizzler?!

01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:37.490
Sizzler?

01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:43.760
Sizzler?

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:46.760
Relzzis?

01:16:47.930 --> 01:16:50.070
Relzzis?

01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:52.440
Sizzler?

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:55.870
Relzzis?

01:16:55.870 --> 01:16:57.710
Sizzler?

01:16:57.710 --> 01:16:58.740
Relzzis?

01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:01.080
Relzzis?

01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:03.380
Sizzler?

01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:06.320
Sizzler?

01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:13.660
Oh, my God! Oh, God!

01:17:17.530 --> 01:17:19.430
Whoa, Sizzler?

01:17:20.430 --> 01:17:22.400
Shit.

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:25.770
Looks like it's just
the two of us.

01:17:25.770 --> 01:17:28.600
No.

01:17:28.610 --> 01:17:30.510
There's a third.

01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:37.350
- T-O-Double-D?
- Mm-hmm.

01:17:38.350 --> 01:17:39.750
It's the last Delta Bi.

01:17:51.630 --> 01:17:54.130
We have Steve Guttenberg
here in the studio

01:17:54.130 --> 01:17:55.770
to talk to us
about his upcoming movie,

01:17:55.770 --> 01:17:58.740
"3 Men and a Baby." Can't wait!

01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:00.100
See you after the late-night
morning movie.

01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:02.410
- Stay tuned!
- Sizzler?

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:06.540
Oh, God! Todd Jr., no!

01:18:06.540 --> 01:18:09.810
Fetus!

01:18:09.810 --> 01:18:11.380
I wish you'd be more positive.

01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:13.380
- I've had a bad day.
- Oh, no.

01:18:13.390 --> 01:18:14.780
Motherface got you guys, too.

01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:16.390
Oh, you don't care.

01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:18.090
You don't even know our names.

01:18:18.090 --> 01:18:19.920
Yea... yeah, I do.

01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:21.520
Name us.

01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:23.430
Todd... no. Turtleneck.

01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:28.530
Turtleneck bro... Flannel bro.

01:18:28.530 --> 01:18:29.830
Lucky guess.

01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:31.970
Only 'cause we're named
after our shirts.

01:18:31.970 --> 01:18:34.870
Can you even name one good time
we've had together?

01:18:34.870 --> 01:18:36.770
Yeah!

01:18:40.540 --> 01:18:42.810
No.

01:18:46.890 --> 01:18:48.720
Aah! Ohh!

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:50.490
Ohh, ohh!

01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:53.990
You're alone, Brent.

01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:55.660
You never avenged your brother.

01:18:55.660 --> 01:18:57.490
You never solved your mystery.

01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:59.630
Oh, you're wrong.

01:18:59.630 --> 01:19:05.070
I'm ready to avenge my brother
because I solved my mystery.

01:19:05.070 --> 01:19:08.470
I know who you are, Motherface.

01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:10.740
You're Ronald Reagan.

01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:15.850
No... no, I'm not.

01:19:15.850 --> 01:19:17.680
Think about it, Mr. President.

01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:21.080
The Dude Bros freshman-year
prank deposed General Cortez.

01:19:21.090 --> 01:19:24.120
Your heavy-metal hot-air
balloon did drive General Cortez

01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:25.590
from the Brazilian embassy.

01:19:25.590 --> 01:19:27.960
So you could install
a puppet dictator

01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:30.130
and turn the tide
in Central America.

01:19:30.130 --> 01:19:33.930
Oh, with their powerful pecs
and extreme athleticism,

01:19:33.930 --> 01:19:38.100
the Delta Bis
were you personal Delta Force.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.810
- This is ridiculous.
- Sophomore year,

01:19:42.810 --> 01:19:44.140
they sold arms to Iran,

01:19:44.140 --> 01:19:46.880
but that went south,
didn't it, Ronnie?

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:50.010
So you decommissioned them
to a frat house in East Chico.

01:19:50.010 --> 01:19:51.710
How convenient.

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:54.020
Oh, except you forgot
about one thing.

01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:56.590
You can't turn off
training like that, can you?

01:19:56.590 --> 01:19:58.590
No. Not like a light switch.

01:19:58.590 --> 01:20:00.590
Part of me did die that day.

01:20:00.590 --> 01:20:03.630
So, two days ago, when they
brought down two planes,

01:20:03.630 --> 01:20:07.000
you got a sex change,
you appointed an imposter

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.930
to take your place in D.C.,

01:20:08.930 --> 01:20:13.770
and donned the face of
Chico's most notorious killer.

01:20:13.770 --> 01:20:16.640
Admit it, Motherface.

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:20.740
You are our nation's
40th president.

01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:26.280
Damn it, Brent.

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:28.550
How did you know?

01:20:28.550 --> 01:20:30.290
I solved it!

01:20:33.890 --> 01:20:35.590
Oh, damn it!

01:20:35.590 --> 01:20:37.760
I really thought I had that one!

01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:39.730
Oh!

01:20:39.730 --> 01:20:42.100
I'm ready to avenge my brother,
Motherface,

01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:43.900
because I know who you are.

01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:45.800
Did you know
about his worst fear?

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:47.540
Running out of beer?

01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:49.940
You knew all kinds of
personal information about us.

01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:51.770
No babies! My seed!

01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:52.880
Aaah!

01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:54.240
My fear is beef!

01:20:54.250 --> 01:20:57.280
And pork and chicken
and all that gross stuff!

01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:59.820
I told you...
I hate handyman work.

01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:01.220
Aaah!

01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:02.950
Z.Q.'s overcome
his fear of heights!

01:21:02.950 --> 01:21:03.920
- Wow!
- We never established

01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:05.290
he was afraid of heights.

01:21:05.290 --> 01:21:06.760
Eh, who cares?
This whole thing's a mess.

01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:08.760
- This is fucking stupid.
- Guys...

01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:11.990
And that's
because you're Turbeaux...

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.800
The school therapist!

01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:15.130
Ow! Why?!

01:21:15.130 --> 01:21:16.930
Why?

01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:19.940
Haven't you been investigating
any of this shit?!

01:21:19.940 --> 01:21:24.010
Your brother murdered my mom
and my twin sister!

01:21:24.610 --> 01:21:28.140
I swore that the reign
of terror of your kind was over.

01:21:28.150 --> 01:21:29.610
I swore that I would find

01:21:29.610 --> 01:21:31.980
the Delta Bis deepest,
darkest fears,

01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:33.850
starting with your brothers,

01:21:33.850 --> 01:21:35.850
and use it to slaughter them!

01:21:35.850 --> 01:21:39.990
- Hey, my brother was...
- Oh, shut the fuck up.

01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:41.890
I was their therapist!

01:21:41.890 --> 01:21:44.730
Oh, the things these guys
told me.

01:21:44.730 --> 01:21:46.630
Did you know that,
two months ago,

01:21:46.630 --> 01:21:48.760
Derek hit a 9-year-old
with his car

01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:51.730
and then buried her
under the football field, huh?

01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:55.970
And Samzy put Coca-Cola
and Pop Rocks in the fuselage

01:21:55.970 --> 01:21:58.670
of the Challenger shuttle
as a goof!

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:02.310
Hey, what about patient-doctor
confidentiality?

01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:04.850
Oh, the sense of entitlement
on these bros!

01:22:04.850 --> 01:22:07.250
Tai chi!

01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:11.050
Why did you join their ranks,
Brent?

01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:15.060
You could've ended this cycle
of meaningless destruction.

01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:17.630
I just wanted to have
the feeling of...

01:22:17.630 --> 01:22:19.760
brotherhood again.

01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:22.130
I...I had a good time.

01:22:22.130 --> 01:22:24.770
Oh, fuck you!

01:22:24.770 --> 01:22:26.340
What about sisterhood?!

01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:28.370
My sister was my best friend.

01:22:28.370 --> 01:22:31.840
None of you motherfuckers have
any sense of goddamn empathy.

01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:34.840
They crashed a plane
into an orphanage.

01:22:34.850 --> 01:22:36.780
An orphanage!

01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:41.180
Well, I was behind the planes,
not them.

01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:44.290
You are just like Brock.

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:48.390
Do you know why your brother

01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:50.990
went to a different college
than you?

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.860
East Chico U.
Has an urban-development major.

01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:54.860
He wanted to be a city planner.

01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:57.730
He told me he needed space.

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:05.940
N-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:08.840
Not so motherfucking fast,
Motherface!

01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:12.780
- Nedry?!
- That's fucking right, bitch!

01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:15.420
You're doing it, Nedry!
You're swearing!

01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:16.950
Looks like I fucking

01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:19.120
handicapped your advantage,
Motherface.

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:21.760
See, I've gained mastery
over all these animals!

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:23.130
Look at my beasts!

01:23:23.130 --> 01:23:25.290
I've forgiven the wolves
that slayed my family

01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:26.830
and become their leader.

01:23:26.830 --> 01:23:28.730
You want to see
some cold-ass shit?

01:23:28.730 --> 01:23:30.330
Ca-caw!

01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:35.710
This here is a motherfucking
bald eagle,

01:23:35.710 --> 01:23:37.310
the most majestic creature
in America,

01:23:37.310 --> 01:23:40.010
and I made him my bitch!

01:23:40.010 --> 01:23:42.980
And it's about to motherfuck
your face, Motherface!

01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:46.350
Because you know, birds
of a feather, flock...

01:23:46.350 --> 01:23:48.480
Together.

01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:03.170
Whoa!

01:24:03.170 --> 01:24:04.300
Tai ch...

01:24:07.210 --> 01:24:08.800
What's the matter?

01:24:08.810 --> 01:24:10.210
All choked up?

01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:28.860
Use her inertia against her.

01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:36.900
Is it really you?

01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:38.330
It's really me.

01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:40.100
It's Brock.

01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:41.340
Weird.

01:24:41.340 --> 01:24:44.170
I...thought you needed space.

01:24:44.180 --> 01:24:47.380
Hey. We've had our space.

01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:49.280
And we'll never need space
again,

01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:52.080
because I'll always
be with you...

01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:54.550
within you.

01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:56.820
Yeah. You'll see.

01:25:01.090 --> 01:25:03.790
Oh, crumbles!

01:25:05.130 --> 01:25:07.860
Virgin sacrifice. Oh!

01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:15.200
Oh, if only I was
a roly-poly bag of oranges!

01:25:15.210 --> 01:25:16.940
I'd bop myself on the nose

01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:20.080
and tumble and fumble
right out of this tender trap.

01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:21.480
Sminkle, it's me.

01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:24.350
Let's get you out of here.

01:25:24.350 --> 01:25:27.820
You lied to me.

01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:30.220
You all lied to me.

01:25:30.220 --> 01:25:33.360
And the Dude Bros aren't really
bags of oranges, are they?

01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:35.460
And every moment
we spent in my bang bus

01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:37.530
meant nothing, did it.

01:25:37.530 --> 01:25:39.230
Well, fine, Candace.

01:25:39.230 --> 01:25:41.030
If dying a virgin
is the only way

01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:43.230
I can save my beloved Chico,

01:25:43.230 --> 01:25:46.240
then I guess that's all
I'm good for.

01:25:48.370 --> 01:25:50.510
Not if I can help it.

01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:52.370
What are you doing?

01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:54.110
Saving your life.

01:25:56.150 --> 01:25:59.080
She's too powerful, Brock.
I let you down.

01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:01.620
Hey, remember
what I always say...

01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:04.590
If you face a foe
you're afraid you can't defeat,

01:26:04.590 --> 01:26:06.460
you got to let your bros in.

01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:07.560
Let us in, Brent.

01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:10.130
Let us all... in.

01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:20.270
All along, Brent, you just
needed to let you bros in.

01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:24.870
I'm ready.

01:26:27.310 --> 01:26:31.910
Bros, enter me!

01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:33.450
Oh!

01:26:34.380 --> 01:26:36.420
Oh!

01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:37.550
Oh-ho-ho!

01:26:37.950 --> 01:26:40.260
- Unh!
- You're doing it.

01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:49.470
Oh!

01:26:49.470 --> 01:26:51.130
Oh-ho-ho!

01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:53.370
Unh!

01:26:53.370 --> 01:26:54.940
Oh!

01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:57.570
Whoa! We're not virgin anymore.

01:26:57.580 --> 01:27:01.040
I feel so free!

01:27:01.050 --> 01:27:01.680
Ah!

01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:03.210
Oh!

01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:39.720
I'll always
be with you, Brent...

01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:44.620
inside your butt
giving you powers.

01:27:44.620 --> 01:27:46.520
Bye-bye.

01:27:58.540 --> 01:28:02.500
And that's the number 1 reason
why Candace and I are in love.

01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:04.240
You fool!

01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:07.610
You had one simple destiny,
Sminkle...

01:28:07.610 --> 01:28:09.040
To stop the Dude Bros,

01:28:09.050 --> 01:28:10.750
and you balls'd it up!

01:28:10.750 --> 01:28:13.080
Do you have any idea

01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:17.750
how much work and taxpayer money
went into this?!

01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:20.160
I learned Latin.

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:22.260
And making
all those blood candles?

01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:26.060
Jesus, I...
I killed so many ducks.

01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:31.100
And Debra... made a lovely cake.

01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:35.100
I ate a goddamn nicoise salad

01:28:35.110 --> 01:28:37.710
to make room
for this cocksucker,

01:28:37.710 --> 01:28:40.140
and now I can't even look at it!

01:28:42.310 --> 01:28:45.350
And you...
You said I could trust you!

01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:47.780
And you fall in love with <i> him?!</i>

01:28:47.790 --> 01:28:49.450
Chief, you got a call

01:28:49.450 --> 01:28:53.720
from the Imperial Dark Majesty
on line 1.

01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:59.630
That's, uh... that's Eric,
and I have to take this.

01:29:05.170 --> 01:29:06.700
Well, we did it, Candy!

01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:09.200
And all because you taught me
to believe in myself.

01:29:09.210 --> 01:29:11.110
Well, I don't want
to take all the credit.

01:29:11.110 --> 01:29:14.210
I mean, you did teach me a thing
or two, as well.

01:29:14.210 --> 01:29:16.710
Hey, I got a silly,
crazy, little old idea.

01:29:16.710 --> 01:29:18.580
What say you and me become
a boyfriend-girlfriend

01:29:18.580 --> 01:29:22.220
mystery-solving team,
banging kids on the side?

01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:24.720
I already know
what our first case will be...

01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:28.060
The Chico County Orange Crisis.

01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:31.530
About that,
I already cracked the case.

01:29:31.530 --> 01:29:35.560
Wow. That was fucking fast.

01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:39.330
Where are your clues, partner?

01:29:39.340 --> 01:29:41.570
I'm a bag of oranges.

01:29:47.380 --> 01:29:48.480
What?

01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:52.350
I'm a bag of oranges.

01:29:52.350 --> 01:29:54.480
That's not a clue.
That's not a clue.

01:29:54.490 --> 01:29:55.620
Search your feelings.

01:29:55.620 --> 01:29:58.490
You know it to be true.

01:29:58.490 --> 01:30:01.590
Bag of oranges, get in here!

01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:04.290
Top 10 reasons magic isn't real.

01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:06.500
Number 10,
I have prayed to a genie

01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:08.530
to take me away
from my abusive home life,

01:30:08.530 --> 01:30:10.430
and it never showed up.

01:30:10.430 --> 01:30:12.470
Candace, please, no!

01:30:12.470 --> 01:30:16.210
Ew! Oh, gosh!

01:30:16.210 --> 01:30:17.710
But I love you!

01:30:17.710 --> 01:30:19.680
If you love me,
you know what you have to do.

01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:22.240
I do.

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:25.350
Look, he's talking to that bag
of oranges again.

01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:27.350
Do it. Save Chico.

01:30:29.790 --> 01:30:33.160
I will always... love you.

01:30:38.830 --> 01:30:41.560
N-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

01:30:41.570 --> 01:30:43.330
<i>I don't want to call things
too early,</i>

01:30:43.330 --> 01:30:44.730

01:30:44.740 --> 01:30:46.500

01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:21.690
Whoo!

Hi, my baby!

01:41:46.030 --> 01:41:48.260

- My baby!

01:41:48.270 --> 01:41:50.800
Sizzler?
