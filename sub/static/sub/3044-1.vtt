Please forgive our revelries, but
we cannot believe our good luck.

01:35.762 --> 01:38.060
That being able, at one time,

01:38.140 --> 01:40.438
to rid the world of an Akkadian

and, at the same time,

01:43.437 --> 01:44.859

NARRATOR: Mathayus,
the once mighty Scorpion King,

04:24.264 --> 04:27.768
has lost his empire
and his beloved queen.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.814
With nothing left to live for.

04:31.897 --> 04:37.495
His only desire is to die well in
the pursuit of mercenary gold,

and freedom from
the pain that haunts him.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.965
King Horus, the most
powerful ruler in the world,

04:54.211 --> 04:56.839
faces a crisis that could
cost him his kingdom.

05:03.637 --> 05:06.732
His brother, Ta/us,
a ruthless warrior,

05:06.807 --> 05:11.904
has taken a legion of SOLDIERS to the
Far East to pillage its treasures

05:12.020 --> 05:14.068
and amass an army
powerful enough

05:14.147 --> 05:17.572
to return and
conquer Horus' kingdom.

05:21.112 --> 05:24.412
Now, Talus marches on
the palace of King Ramusan,

05:24.908 --> 05:27.957
Horus' last ally
in the known world,

05:28.453 --> 05:32.674
and guardian of the
legendary Book of the Dead.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.929
Horus must stop Talus before
he lays hands on the Book

05:38.088 --> 05:41.012
and enslaves Ramusan's people.

05:41.091 --> 05:45.187
For this,
he needs a fearless champion

05:45.262 --> 05:50.644
willing to accept what is
certainly a suicide mission.

05:54.437 --> 05:55.689
HORUS: Well done, Mathayus.

05:57.440 --> 06:00.990
Formidable work besting Siris.

06:02.279 --> 06:04.657
He was one of my most
valued military advisors.

06:05.115 --> 06:08.460
That's funny. He didn't seem
to have a head for battle.

06:08.743 --> 06:11.166
Humor from an Akkadian, proof
that anything is possible.

06:12.956 --> 06:15.254
We intercepted one of
his messenger parcels

06:15.375 --> 06:17.673
detailing all of our
defensive strongholds.

06:18.295 --> 06:19.888
Who was he working for?

06:19.963 --> 06:22.466
My brother. Talus.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.886
After my father died and
left the kingdom to me,

06:25.969 --> 06:29.348
Talus became very, very angry.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.861
He thought he was the
rightful heir to the throne.

06:33.935 --> 06:36.688
With all due respect, Your Highness,
I have a few vessels of wine

06:36.771 --> 06:39.866
and a small army of harem
girls to conquer tonight.

06:39.983 --> 06:43.203
Can we just skip to the part where
you tell me who you want killed?

06:43.320 --> 06:46.494
Your royal nobility didn't
take long to wear off.

06:53.830 --> 06:54.922
Walk with me.

07:03.006 --> 07:04.098
BOY: The king.

07:04.174 --> 07:09.305
Someone that they call Cobra is the
leader of the tribal resistance.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.848
MATHAYUS: (SCOFFS) Naming yourself
after a venomous creature?

07:11.932 --> 07:13.400
Why didn't I think of that?

07:13.516 --> 07:17.612
Once he finds out your mission
is to protect King Ramusan,

07:17.687 --> 07:20.315
I'm hoping that
he comes to your aid.

07:22.192 --> 07:26.868
Your chances of survival,
Mathayus, are minimal at best.

07:28.031 --> 07:29.658
When do I leave?

07:30.450 --> 07:31.542
Tomorrow.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.246
Well, better start drinking.
(CHUCKLES)

07:34.955 --> 07:36.628
I only need you
to hold Talus off

07:36.706 --> 07:38.754
long enough for me
to get my army there.

07:39.501 --> 07:42.129
King Ramusan will give you
10,000 pieces of gold

07:42.212 --> 07:43.759
at the completion
of your mission.

07:43.838 --> 07:46.432
I will give you another
10 upon my arrival.

07:46.508 --> 07:50.638
That is, if you survive
long enough to collect it.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.561
I'm sending someone with you.

07:54.057 --> 07:56.151
I work alone.
You know that.

07:56.226 --> 07:59.651
Mathayus, you stand to
help a great many people.

07:59.729 --> 08:04.235
Perhaps that can provide some
redemption for past sins.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.913
I'll never have
redemption for the past.

08:08.989 --> 08:12.835
The gods will curse my passing,
and I will thank them for it.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.786

of the great siege of Babylon.

He's sent to kill you!

09:11.176 --> 09:13.144
He's working for me.

09:15.972 --> 09:18.851
Olaf's devotion to the
realm, albeit humbling,

09:18.933 --> 09:20.901
tends to cloud his judgment.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.479
My apologies.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.481
And you're working with him.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.784

10:31.840 --> 10:33.262
you're no Akkadian.

56:00.607 --> 56:01.904
Fight to the death!

56:12.578 --> 56:14.797
Protect the Book at any cost!

56:37.185 --> 56:40.314
If we are to believe his
servants, King Ramusan has fled.

56:40.397 --> 56:42.570
Without the Book of the Dead?
Never.

56:46.528 --> 56:48.496
When we find
the secret chamber,

56:48.614 --> 56:50.537
we find the Book
and its keeper.

56:57.915 --> 57:00.589
We are warriors, Ramusan.

57:00.667 --> 57:04.513
Stop hiding like a quivering
handmaiden and bring me the Book.

57:06.131 --> 57:08.304
This may be my final breath,

57:08.800 --> 57:12.850
but the people of this land will
rise above my failures as a king.

57:14.848 --> 57:18.773
And you will need much more than the
army you brought to break them.

57:19.686 --> 57:22.940
You know, you might be correct.

57:27.945 --> 57:33.543
Now if only I had a weapon

57:39.164 --> 57:43.044

57:46.004 --> 57:50.726
that would rid
me of these pests.

59:44.164 --> 59:45.837
If you truly want
to help your people,

59:45.957 --> 59:47.675
you'll find a man
that did not fail his.

59:48.668 --> 59:50.670
The gods have their way,

59:51.004 --> 59:54.008
and not even the mightiest

01:00:00.889 --> 01:00:04.189
There are more than 500,000
people in this country.

01:00:06.019 --> 01:00:11.071
Talus will not stop until he enslaves
them all to build his empire.

01:00:11.149 --> 01:00:13.447
Then he will march
on Horus' kingdom

01:00:13.527 --> 01:00:16.576
with the largest army
anyone has ever seen before.

01:00:17.531 --> 01:00:19.829
Fight with me and
we can stop him.

01:00:19.908 --> 01:00:23.003
And maybe, in some small way, you
can forgive yourself for the past.

01:00:24.746 --> 01:00:27.545
I will never forgive
myself for the past.

01:00:29.709 --> 01:00:32.178

never have a future.

01:00:47.602 --> 01:00:49.070

(GRUNTING)

01:29:16.351 --> 01:29:17.523
(GRUNTING)

01:29:27.696 --> 01:29:30.449
You fight well, mortal.
Perhaps we'll take you with us.

01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:33.619
Spend eternity with two mindless
brutes and their pet witch?

01:29:34.077 --> 01:29:35.545
No thank you!
(SCREECHING)

01:29:57.684 --> 01:30:00.563
You want Mathayus, but he
will never stay with you.

01:30:01.271 --> 01:30:03.899
He is one of the
darkness, like us!

01:30:03.982 --> 01:30:05.859
He only wishes to die.

01:30:06.318 --> 01:30:07.991
And you are Cobra.

01:30:08.069 --> 01:30:11.573
Your deception is the poison
that is killing your people.

01:30:11.656 --> 01:30:12.657
(YELLING)

01:30:28.048 --> 01:30:29.675
(GRUNTING)

01:30:43.730 --> 01:30:45.482
Move it!
Missed me!

01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:50.328
(BOTH EXCLAIMING)

01:31:29.985 --> 01:31:31.157
(YELLING)

01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:44.916
The Book!

01:32:17.615 --> 01:32:19.242
(ELEPHANTS TRUMPETING)

(TRUMPETING)

01:32:51.357 --> 01:32:52.734
You sure you don't
want to go that way?

01:32:53.735 --> 01:32:55.703
You might have a chance.

01:32:56.488 --> 01:32:59.708
You should know better than to
back an animal into a corner.

01:33:16.091 --> 01:33:18.344
(CHANTING)

01:33:24.057 --> 01:33:27.732

01:33:36.069 --> 01:33:38.037
MAN: Who's gonna save you now?

01:33:39.531 --> 01:33:40.783
TALUS: You know what?

01:33:40.865 --> 01:33:44.540
The Book of the Dead already
courses through my body.

01:33:44.619 --> 01:33:46.542
I don't need this trinket.

01:33:56.840 --> 01:34:01.596
Go ahead. Let them have me.
Let them devour me.

01:34:01.803 --> 01:34:06.934
I will rise again like a bad
idea, and you will be crushed.

01:34:10.395 --> 01:34:11.738
You first.

01:34:29.038 --> 01:34:30.039
(SCREECHING)

01:34:31.124 --> 01:34:32.125
(YELLING)

01:34:36.713 --> 01:34:38.306
You've been a worthy adversary.

01:34:43.636 --> 01:34:44.683
Olaf.

01:34:45.763 --> 01:34:47.936
(SCREECHING)

01:34:49.142 --> 01:34:51.270

(CONTINUES CHANTING)

01:35:24.052 --> 01:35:25.178
Well, come on!

01:35:54.290 --> 01:35:57.260
My Lord,
the warriors of the Book

01:35:57.460 --> 01:35:59.212
are at your service.

01:36:00.338 --> 01:36:02.181
I'm sorry I deceived you.

01:36:02.257 --> 01:36:03.930
Please forgive me.

01:36:05.593 --> 01:36:08.517
There's nothing
to forgive, Cobra.

01:36:10.932 --> 01:36:13.230
I am proud of you, my daughter.

01:36:13.685 --> 01:36:14.686
(GROANS)

01:36:16.312 --> 01:36:18.565
With honor,
we join you in battle.

01:36:20.358 --> 01:36:23.282
This battle is over.

01:36:23.361 --> 01:36:25.238
At least it is for me.

01:36:27.407 --> 01:36:29.535
My people are in good hands.

01:36:38.126 --> 01:36:39.548
Father?

01:36:40.169 --> 01:36:41.216
Father!

01:36:42.171 --> 01:36:43.343
Father!

01:36:57.895 --> 01:36:59.522
(OFFICER SHOUTING)

(OFFICER SHOUTING)

01:37:33.890 --> 01:37:34.937
My champion.

01:37:36.059 --> 01:37:37.686
You've done well.

01:37:41.022 --> 01:37:42.365
Is there a problem?

01:37:43.900 --> 01:37:46.323
Do you need more gold?
Consider it done.

01:37:47.153 --> 01:37:49.576
It's not that, Your Highness.

01:37:49.655 --> 01:37:52.124
I actually have
some gold for you.

01:37:53.451 --> 01:37:55.328
These are the fortunes
of your brother, Talus,

01:37:55.411 --> 01:37:57.789
minus the expenses it will
cost to repair this land.

01:37:58.247 --> 01:37:59.874
They're rightfully yours.

01:37:59.957 --> 01:38:01.584
I don't understand.

01:38:02.293 --> 01:38:04.842
I could've easily retrieved
it from the palace myself.

01:38:07.090 --> 01:38:09.092
Probably not a good idea.

01:38:10.218 --> 01:38:11.310
Meaning?

01:38:11.803 --> 01:38:15.603
With all due respect, Your
Highness, you're not welcome here.

01:38:16.474 --> 01:38:18.772
These people will no longer
accept foreign rule.

01:38:19.727 --> 01:38:21.354
Now, they are grateful
for everything you have done

01:38:21.437 --> 01:38:22.984
to help them to be free,

01:38:23.064 --> 01:38:25.237
but they are willing to
fight to stay that way.

01:38:25.316 --> 01:38:26.863
Will they now?

01:38:29.195 --> 01:38:35.669
Well, since they have sent you as
their messenger, tell them this.

01:38:38.079 --> 01:38:39.672
It's not their
decision to make.

01:38:40.873 --> 01:38:45.344
I have not come as their messenger, Sire.
I have come as their king.

01:39:03.062 --> 01:39:07.112
You expect me to accept your claim
to the throne, uncontested?

01:39:08.151 --> 01:39:10.074
I expect nothing
more than your respect.

01:39:10.611 --> 01:39:13.410
For myself and for
the people of this land.

01:39:14.532 --> 01:39:16.455
Now, if it is a fight
that you are looking for,

01:39:18.202 --> 01:39:20.079
then you shall have it.

01:39:28.963 --> 01:39:31.557
You surprise me, Akkadian.

01:39:31.632 --> 01:39:36.308
I thought that you had traded in your
royal nobility for a few sacks of gold.

01:39:37.054 --> 01:39:38.271
I had.

01:39:39.098 --> 01:39:43.069
But now, if need be, I'm willing
to trade my life to get it back.

01:39:43.561 --> 01:39:44.733
I believe you.

01:39:45.563 --> 01:39:48.942
And whether I give you
my blessing or my blade,

01:39:50.776 --> 01:39:52.073
I respect you.

01:39:54.197 --> 01:39:56.291
But I must confer
with my generals.

01:39:57.158 --> 01:39:59.001
When you are the king,

01:39:59.076 --> 01:40:02.296
the concerns of the realm
come first and foremost.

01:40:04.499 --> 01:40:07.423
But you already
knew that, didn't you?

01:40:32.693 --> 01:40:33.945

01:41:16.571 --> 01:41:17.868
