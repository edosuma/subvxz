00:32.091 --> 00:33.418
Hey.

00:34.299 --> 00:36.217
Check this out.

00:37.336 --> 00:39.218
- Left-handed!
- Yeah, nice shot.

00:39.253 --> 00:42.055
Hey, skip Mrs. Nelson's house.
She's on vacation.

00:42.090 --> 00:45.090
- Why don't we get a vacation?
- Yeah. Where do you want to go, huh?

00:45.125 --> 00:45.985
Acapulco?

00:46.020 --> 00:48.936
I don't care. I mean, just anywhere
without these papers, you know?

00:48.971 --> 00:50.864
That'd be nice.

00:54.094 --> 00:55.765
Hey, what are you doing?
That's Mr. Monk's house.

00:55.800 --> 00:57.057
You can't throw it.

00:57.092 --> 00:58.170
No, no.
Not that one.

00:58.205 --> 01:00.752
The paper's wrinkled.
He likes it smooth.

01:10.173 --> 01:13.223
No, no, no. Not there.
You gotta go and put it on the front door.

01:18.014 --> 01:19.875
Hey, it's gone!

01:20.503 --> 01:21.727
What do you mean it's gone?

01:21.762 --> 01:24.253
Well, it's not there.
Just give me another one.

01:36.667 --> 01:37.830
Let's go

01:37.865 --> 01:40.268
Hey, did you put it
in the center of the mat?

01:40.293 --> 01:42.482
It needs to be centered

01:47.202 --> 01:48.763
Hey!
What are you doing?

01:51.720 --> 01:53.215
Nestor?

01:53.250 --> 01:54.576
Nestor, what are you doing?

01:55.462 --> 01:58.086
Oh, my God! What's happening?
Nestor, are you okay?

01:58.629 --> 01:59.728
Nestor?

02:01.137 --> 02:02.196
What...

02:03.992 --> 02:06.406
for a newspaper?

02:10.814 --> 02:13.895
MONK Season 2 Epi. 10
Mr. Monk and the Paperboy

03:23.540 --> 03:24.848
Coming through.

03:26.648 --> 03:29.066
All right, boys and girls,
moms and dads,

03:29.101 --> 03:31.530
this crime scene is getting cold.

03:31.938 --> 03:33.581
- Donohue?
- Yes, sir?

03:33.616 --> 03:36.812
I want you to get two uniforms
and start knocking on doors.

03:36.847 --> 03:40.675
Any car that's not parked in
the driveway, run the plates.

03:40.912 --> 03:44.484
So, is that coffee ready yet?

03:44.519 --> 03:49.078
Uh, what are they doing here?

03:49.113 --> 03:52.916
What? It's a crime scene. There
was a murder right out front. - But...

03:52.951 --> 03:56.126
- They had to set up somewhere.
- C... Hello!

03:56.161 --> 03:58.610
Excuse me!
Don't touch that.

03:58.645 --> 04:00.339
Who are you talking to?

04:00.620 --> 04:02.416
Everyone.

04:03.519 --> 04:05.021
How's he doing?

04:05.347 --> 04:07.647
Oh, great.
No problem.

04:09.174 --> 04:10.477
Hey, Monk.

04:10.934 --> 04:12.323
I need to ask you a couple questions.

04:12.358 --> 04:15.739
- Did you know the victim?
- Yes, it was Nestor Alverez.

04:15.774 --> 04:19.962
He and his cousin have been
delivering my newspaper for two years.

04:19.997 --> 04:24.205
Now, according to the cousin, Nestor
caught the killer stealing your newspaper.

04:24.240 --> 04:25.344
That's what the fight was about.

04:25.379 --> 04:27.343
- My newspaper?
- Yeah.

04:27.378 --> 04:30.452
Yep. Nestor puts down a paper,
the killer stole it.

04:30.487 --> 04:32.411
Puts down another paper,
the killer steals that one.

04:32.446 --> 04:34.246
Does that make
any sense to you? - Uh-uh.

04:34.281 --> 04:35.771
What did he look like?

04:35.806 --> 04:37.846
The cousin can't identify the guy.

04:37.881 --> 04:38.758
Did you hear anything?

04:38.793 --> 04:40.944
- What time was that?
- 5:30.

04:40.979 --> 04:43.015
Oh, no.
I wouldn't have heard a thing.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.240
Sleeping?

04:45.761 --> 04:47.227
No

04:47.262 --> 04:48.841
I was vacuuming.

04:54.391 --> 04:55.411
Hello?

04:55.446 --> 04:57.225
Uh, excuse me.

04:57.800 --> 05:01.190
- Did something happen?
- There's been a homicide.

05:01.225 --> 05:02.803
A homicide?

05:02.838 --> 05:06.230
You mean a murder?
Holy Toledo. Here?

05:06.265 --> 05:09.030
Right out front, early this morning.
Somebody killed the paperboy.

05:09.065 --> 05:10.304
- Holy Toledo.
- And you are?

05:10.339 --> 05:12.529
I'm Kevin Dorfman.

05:12.564 --> 05:16.766
"D" for dolly.
"O" as in orange.

05:16.801 --> 05:19.981
- "R" as in Robert.
- Dorfman. Yeah, I got it.

05:20.016 --> 05:23.182
- Where do you live, Kevin?
- I live upstairs.

05:23.217 --> 05:27.980
Did you hear or see anything
early this morning, say around 5:30?

05:28.015 --> 05:34.398
No, sir, I did not.
I was, you know, with someone.

05:34.433 --> 05:35.908
Your girlfriend?

05:36.637 --> 05:38.244
I guess so.

05:39.207 --> 05:41.755
Holy Toledo,
I have a girlfriend.

05:41.790 --> 05:44.432
Well, we're gonna need to
question her too.

05:44.467 --> 05:46.724
- How long have you lived upstairs?
- Seven months.

05:46.759 --> 05:50.826
Before that, let's see,
I lived at 12 Grant Street.

05:50.861 --> 05:53.880
Before that,
17 Minton Street with my sister...

05:53.915 --> 05:56.333
until she moved to Baltimore
because she had to take a new job.

05:56.368 --> 05:57.222
Great.
Thank you.

05:57.257 --> 06:03.265
Before that, I lived at
34 Warren Place for two years.

06:03.300 --> 06:07.976
Before that, I lived at 8 Todd Road...

06:08.011 --> 06:11.830
and 45 Radcliffe Street, consecutively.

06:11.865 --> 06:15.695
My first place, though,
on 26 Armory Lane, that was a studio.

06:15.730 --> 06:17.492
But what I did was...

06:17.527 --> 06:19.476
you might want to write this down
on a separate page for yourself...

06:19.511 --> 06:23.341
I put the bed up on a loft
to create some space.

06:23.376 --> 06:25.602
Adrian, Adrian.
Give it to me. - Ugh.

06:25.878 --> 06:27.970
Can I go home now?

06:28.005 --> 06:30.519
- You are home.
- Oh, yeah.

06:30.554 --> 06:32.457
Just relax.
It's fine.

06:32.492 --> 06:34.648
Oh, excuse me.
Where's the bathroom?

06:34.683 --> 06:37.714
I, uh... I don't have one.

06:37.749 --> 06:39.045
You don't have a bathroom?

06:39.080 --> 06:43.444
Don't get me started.
I am still so angry at that architect.

06:45.526 --> 06:46.735
Excuse me?

06:47.081 --> 06:48.475
Excuse me?

06:49.057 --> 06:51.111
What are you doing?

06:51.146 --> 06:54.448
- Wiping my feet.
- On a mat?

06:59.636 --> 07:00.588
Wha...

07:03.904 --> 07:06.060
Kevin, is it true?

07:06.095 --> 07:08.541
- Somebody was killed?
- The paperboy.

07:08.576 --> 07:10.839
- Oh, God.
- Right out front.

07:10.874 --> 07:12.913
- When?
- This morning,

07:12.948 --> 07:19.875
around 5:30 while we were,
you know... - Mm. Mm.

07:19.910 --> 07:22.570
Sharona.
Hi. How are you?

07:22.605 --> 07:25.744
- Oh, good. Yeah.
- Yeah?

07:25.779 --> 07:28.808
Lieutenant, hi.
Vicki. - Hi.

07:28.843 --> 07:30.780
- Vicki...
- Salinas.

07:30.815 --> 07:34.494
Oh, you work at the Stop-N-Go
on Ridgedale, right?

07:34.529 --> 07:36.250
That's how we met.
That's how we met.

07:36.285 --> 07:39.640
Vicki's been serving me my doughnut
and super-sized latte every morning

07:39.675 --> 07:41.008
for the past five months.

07:41.043 --> 07:44.059
Well, when we first met,
I wasn't super-sizing. No.

07:44.094 --> 07:46.597
But then last July,
I had to pull a couple of all-nighters...

07:46.632 --> 07:49.486
because I was working on
that new inventory diagnostic software.

07:49.521 --> 07:52.071
- I told you about that job. You remember?
- Yes, you did. Mm-hmm.

07:52.106 --> 07:55.593
But wait
It wasn't July, it was August.

07:55.628 --> 07:57.976
How long have you two been going out?

07:58.011 --> 08:00.600
- Since yesterday.
- Really? Wow. That's...

08:00.635 --> 08:01.799
That's fast.

08:01.834 --> 08:03.165
- Yeah.
- Yeah

08:03.200 --> 08:05.618
I've been asking her out
all summer long.

08:05.949 --> 08:10.792
"No." "No."
"Drop dead." "No."

08:10.827 --> 08:14.499
But then suddenly last night, "Yes".

08:14.534 --> 08:16.751
And I've been
saying "Yes" ever since.

08:16.786 --> 08:18.456
Hey, Sharona.

08:18.491 --> 08:20.890
You're still Monk's nurse, right?

08:21.368 --> 08:23.553
Try to get him out of here.

08:25.129 --> 08:26.455
Good luck.

08:32.815 --> 08:33.871
Hey.

08:34.339 --> 08:37.057
- How are you doing?
- I was just thinking about the murder.

08:37.092 --> 08:39.467
Well, let's go outside.
You think better outside.

08:39.501 --> 08:41.493
Why would anybody
want to kill a paperboy?

08:41.528 --> 08:43.600
What were they after?

08:44.047 --> 08:46.458
Maybe he was
too cheap to buy his own.

08:46.493 --> 08:48.746
Why would he steal two?
That's the thing.

08:48.781 --> 08:51.141
He could have just taken the first one,
but he stuck around.

08:51.176 --> 08:53.143
He wanted both.

08:53.178 --> 08:56.455
I think there's something
in the newspaper

08:56.490 --> 08:58.357
he didn't want me to see.

08:58.392 --> 09:00.154
- What?
- I don't know.

09:00.189 --> 09:03.308
Maybe an article
about another crime he committed.

09:03.343 --> 09:05.239
Do me a favor.
Go down the street

09:05.274 --> 09:06.542
- buy me a newspaper.
- Okay. Okay,

09:06.577 --> 09:08.265
- but you're coming with me.
- I can't.

09:08.300 --> 09:10.443
If something spills,
I want to be here.

09:10.478 --> 09:12.235
Adrian, trust me.
If something spills,

09:12.270 --> 09:14.931
you don't want to be here.

09:14.966 --> 09:17.476
- That's a good point.
- Let's go.

09:20.267 --> 09:22.563
There's something in here.

09:23.038 --> 09:25.901
Something they did not want me to see.

09:27.703 --> 09:30.916
Look at the employee of the month.
Kevin's new girlfriend.

09:30.951 --> 09:32.270
What does she see in him?

09:32.305 --> 09:35.103
Oh, I guess you never know.
I mean, look who I married.

09:36.204 --> 09:37.347
Yes.

09:38.036 --> 09:42.679
People used to say
Trudy was way out of my league.

09:42.923 --> 09:45.770
- Do you think they were right?
- Oh, of course they were.

09:45.805 --> 09:49.654
Oh, here.
They have Sierra Springs.

09:49.689 --> 09:51.263
It's my favorite.

09:51.671 --> 09:54.065
Oh, could you grab me a cream soda?

09:54.100 --> 09:56.709
I love their cream sodas.
It's the only place you can get it.

10:07.548 --> 10:11.444
Ah. Some kid must have
tightened it on for a joke.

10:11.479 --> 10:13.095
Give it to me.

10:15.678 --> 10:16.657
Here.

10:20.222 --> 10:21.644
I loosened it.

10:22.136 --> 10:23.681
No, you didn't.

10:25.217 --> 10:26.818
How are you folks doing?

10:26.853 --> 10:28.697
Do you really want to know?

10:29.231 --> 10:30.358
No.

10:31.958 --> 10:35.045
- How about a lottery ticket?
- Oh, no. You just had a big winner.

10:35.080 --> 10:38.376
I never buy a ticket unless
the jackpot's more than $10 million, so...

10:38.411 --> 10:40.462
Yeah, $10 million.

10:40.497 --> 10:43.938
I don't know how
they can even call that a "jackpot."

10:46.504 --> 10:49.182
- Anything?
- Nothing yet.

10:49.706 --> 10:52.147
Well, here, let me have a section.

10:54.353 --> 10:56.301
- What are we looking for?
- I don't know.

10:56.336 --> 10:58.951
Just anything unusual.

11:00.228 --> 11:03.127
"Hit-And-Run Driver
Kills Grandmother."

11:04.329 --> 11:05.901
Where did that happen?

11:06.388 --> 11:08.138
Laurel Heights.

11:08.173 --> 11:11.328
- Around 3:00 p. m.?
- 3:15. Why?

11:12.127 --> 11:15.159
Call the Captain.
I think I just solved the case.

11:15.327 --> 11:16.582
What?

11:29.062 --> 11:32.626
- You think the killer's in there?
- I'd bet your paycheck on it.

11:34.651 --> 11:38.256
I don't understand.
Why was he stealing your paper?

11:38.291 --> 11:41.338
Because he didn't want me
to see these two articles.

11:41.373 --> 11:44.666
He knew I was the only one
who could possibly

11:44.701 --> 11:47.275
see the connection between them.

11:47.310 --> 11:49.785
You're feeling pretty good
about yourself, huh?

11:49.820 --> 11:51.593
I'm allowed, once a decade.

11:51.628 --> 11:55.111
- Did you call the captain?
- He'll be here in 10 minutes.

11:55.146 --> 11:57.190
Let's wait outside.

12:01.875 --> 12:03.169
It's stuck.
You gotta push it.

12:03.204 --> 12:05.126
I'm pushing.

12:08.160 --> 12:11.047
Uh, let's just wait in the car.

12:13.834 --> 12:16.882
Okay, there you go.
Now we've got it. - All right.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.708
You think you're stronger than me.

12:21.583 --> 12:24.921
What? - You think
you're stronger than me.

12:25.477 --> 12:28.469
- I didn't say anything.
- But it's what you're thinking.

12:28.504 --> 12:30.439
You think you could take me.

12:30.474 --> 12:33.123
- Why would I want to "take you"?
- I don't know.

12:33.158 --> 12:37.607
- What if one day I went nuts?
- What if you went nuts? Oh, boy.

12:37.642 --> 12:39.240
I really have to use
my imagination for that one.

12:39.275 --> 12:41.685
I'm just saying, what if?
What if...

12:41.720 --> 12:44.737
What if I attacked you?
Do you...

12:44.772 --> 12:46.448
think you could take me?

12:47.201 --> 12:49.282
I don't know.
Maybe I could.

12:49.317 --> 12:50.782
But so what?

12:51.129 --> 12:53.280
I work out.
I take care of myself.

12:53.315 --> 12:56.116
Why, because I couldn't
open the car door

12:56.151 --> 12:59.413
or... or the water bottle?
That doesn't mean anything.

12:59.448 --> 13:02.818
Fine. You're stronger than me.
Okay, you win.

13:02.871 --> 13:05.871
Let's just drop it.
God!

13:08.321 --> 13:11.819
- I can bench 200.
- I'm happy for you.

13:11.854 --> 13:13.932
What can you bench?

13:14.913 --> 13:18.148
- I don't know.
- But you can't bench 200.

13:19.243 --> 13:20.829
What you want to do?
You want to fight?

13:20.864 --> 13:22.161
Is that what you want to do?

13:22.196 --> 13:25.448
Come on, let's settle it...
right here, right now, you and me.

13:25.483 --> 13:27.304
- Ah!
- What are you doing?

13:27.339 --> 13:28.182
Hey!

13:28.470 --> 13:29.965
You guys all right?

13:31.130 --> 13:34.163
- You need a referee?
- Oh, no, no, no. We're fine.

13:34.198 --> 13:35.252
I just hurt his feelings

13:35.287 --> 13:38.874
- 'cause I'm stronger than him.
- She's not stronger than me.

13:38.909 --> 13:41.663
- The car door was jammed.
- If it was jammed,

13:41.698 --> 13:44.080
- how did I open it?
- Leverage.

13:44.115 --> 13:46.678
- It's called leverage.
- Excuse me!

13:46.713 --> 13:48.887
Did somebody call a police officer?

13:49.274 --> 13:52.829
Captain, I... I... I think I know
why the paperboy was killed.

13:52.864 --> 13:55.078
Take a look at this.
On the front page.

13:55.113 --> 13:57.282
- Okay.
- Now look at this.

14:00.771 --> 14:01.702
Wow.

14:02.380 --> 14:04.694
- What do you think?
- Is he in there right now?

14:04.729 --> 14:08.300
- According to his secretary.
- Let's go check it out.

14:16.125 --> 14:17.495
Okay.

14:18.648 --> 14:20.000
Here we go.

14:23.451 --> 14:25.554
Sorry.
I wasn't laughing at you.

14:25.776 --> 14:27.094
I was.

14:30.907 --> 14:33.097
I might be able to bang out the fender,

14:33.776 --> 14:35.159
but you're gonna need
a whole new grill. - Yeah.

14:35.194 --> 14:37.946
Whatever it takes.
How long do you think?

14:37.981 --> 14:38.966
A week.

14:39.001 --> 14:41.245
I'll give you $200 extra
if you can have it done by tomorrow.

14:41.280 --> 14:43.774
- Are you Malcolm Cowley?
- That's right.

14:44.128 --> 14:46.308
I'm Captain Stottlemeyer,
San Francisco P. D.

14:46.343 --> 14:48.494
This is Lieutenant Disher,
Sharona Fleming.

14:48.529 --> 14:53.371
And I am Adrian Monk.

14:53.633 --> 14:55.710
The Adrian Monk.

14:55.745 --> 14:57.332
Is there a problem?

14:57.739 --> 14:59.408
I was reading about you
in the newspaper.

14:59.443 --> 15:02.047
Sharona, wipe?
I need a wipe here.

15:02.082 --> 15:05.095
That's you, isn't it?
"It Just Wasn't His Day."

15:05.733 --> 15:08.789
It says here that you had two accidents
in the course of 10 minutes.

15:08.824 --> 15:12.409
First you hit a little tree; then you drove
another half mile and hit a lamppost.

15:12.444 --> 15:13.470
That's right.

15:13.936 --> 15:14.947
Is that a crime?

15:14.982 --> 15:18.076
Yeah, it is if you were intentionally
damaging your car...

15:18.111 --> 15:20.488
so you wouldn't have to
explain a smashed-in grill.

15:20.523 --> 15:23.076
See, Mr. Monk found this other article.

15:23.111 --> 15:25.715
"Hit-And-Run Driver Kills A Grandmother."

15:26.554 --> 15:27.983
Same neighborhood,

15:28.614 --> 15:31.047
same approximate time.

15:31.545 --> 15:33.604
We thought there might
be a connection. - Hmm.

15:33.639 --> 15:34.772
Captain.

15:35.572 --> 15:36.873
Blood.

15:37.936 --> 15:39.158
Turn around.

15:39.647 --> 15:41.329
Put your hands on the car.

15:42.967 --> 15:46.682
You, sir, are under arrest
for vehicular manslaughter,

15:47.388 --> 15:51.590
leaving the scene of a crime
and for the murder of Nestor Alverez.

15:51.625 --> 15:52.820
Come with me.

15:53.815 --> 15:55.089
He's not the guy.

15:55.124 --> 15:56.075
What?

15:56.282 --> 15:57.905
Monk, we got him dead to rights.

15:57.940 --> 16:01.523
He is guilty of the hit-and-run,
but he didn't kill the paperboy.

16:01.558 --> 16:03.811
He didn't know who I was.

16:03.846 --> 16:07.162
There is something else
in this newspaper,

16:07.197 --> 16:09.351
something I'm missing.

16:11.920 --> 16:15.457
Oh, my God!

16:16.917 --> 16:21.653
Oh, the humanity!

16:21.688 --> 16:24.941
Yeah, you're stronger than me.

16:26.549 --> 16:28.607
Captain, I have a thought...

16:30.083 --> 16:31.773
about the paperboy.

16:35.577 --> 16:38.170
- This means "hurry up."
- It was a burglary.

16:38.205 --> 16:40.553
The paperboy interrupted
a B-and-E in progress.

16:40.588 --> 16:41.576
It fits.

16:41.611 --> 16:43.959
There were five break-ins
on that block last year alone.

16:43.994 --> 16:44.947
Nope.

16:44.982 --> 16:46.766
I looked into that already.

16:46.801 --> 16:49.841
All of those break-ins were hot prowls...

16:49.876 --> 16:52.183
- forced entry with a crowbar.
- Right.

16:52.218 --> 16:54.763
- Our guy was empty-handed.
- What about a car thief?

16:54.798 --> 16:58.609
Well, that doesn't explain
the taking of the newspapers, does it?

16:58.644 --> 16:59.539
Right.

17:00.111 --> 17:03.688
- So we're back to Monk's theory.
- I'm afraid so.

17:08.794 --> 17:12.102
And this means
"We're leaving." - Right.

17:14.265 --> 17:15.459
Monk?

17:16.285 --> 17:19.655
Oh, thank God. Here.
I thought we could each take a section.

17:26.751 --> 17:30.368
- Wow. How'd you clean up so fast?
- I cleaned up last night.

17:30.403 --> 17:32.357
Did you sleep at all?

17:32.772 --> 17:34.833
He can sleep while he cleans.

17:35.735 --> 17:36.955
I've seen it.

17:37.341 --> 17:41.929
Okay, there's something here,
something I'm missing.

17:41.964 --> 17:44.233
Something worth killing for.

17:44.671 --> 17:47.533
All right. Well, let's just
go through it line by line.

17:47.568 --> 17:51.386
"Partly cloudy, chance of showers."
Could that mean anything?

17:51.421 --> 17:52.260
Here's something.

17:52.295 --> 17:54.919
There was a drug bust in Hunter's Point.

17:55.194 --> 17:59.402
Oh, yeah. I'm aware of that one.
That's nothing. Strictly routine.

17:59.437 --> 18:01.256
Okay, comics.

18:01.291 --> 18:04.177
Maybe there's something hidden in here.

18:04.636 --> 18:07.167
Oh, Marmaduke.

18:07.551 --> 18:09.122
I love Marmaduke.

18:11.600 --> 18:15.601
He's this... He's a dog
but he's enormous.

18:15.636 --> 18:17.782
Y-You can't believe
how big this dog is.

18:17.817 --> 18:20.301
W-We know who Marmaduke is.

18:20.336 --> 18:21.550
Yeah, look.

18:21.879 --> 18:24.352
He ate the whole turkey
right off the table.

18:24.387 --> 18:28.441
"I guess we can forget about leftovers."

18:30.544 --> 18:31.569
Hello?

18:31.604 --> 18:34.304
Oh, come in, Kevin.
We're right in here.

18:34.339 --> 18:38.054
Oh, hi. Excuse me.
Sorry to bother you.

18:38.089 --> 18:42.074
Adrian, do you have any olive oil?

18:42.804 --> 18:46.666
I'm making mushroom moussaka.
It's Vicki's favorite.

18:46.701 --> 18:49.496
Uh, uh, yeah, I think so.

18:51.611 --> 18:53.454
How's it going up there?

18:53.489 --> 18:54.535
Pretty good

18:54.570 --> 18:56.550
We haven't left
the apartment since Friday.

18:56.585 --> 19:00.269
I know. I can, uh... I know.

19:00.304 --> 19:05.270
- The fact is, I think I'm in love.
- Good. Good. Love is good.

19:07.230 --> 19:08.844
Is there anything else?

19:08.879 --> 19:10.825
Oh, well, let's see.

19:10.860 --> 19:13.908
Uh, I have the eggplant.

19:14.226 --> 19:16.218
- I have the chopped onions.
- Excellent.

19:16.253 --> 19:17.975
I have the salt.

19:18.010 --> 19:19.227
- And I have the cinnamon.
- Okay!

19:19.262 --> 19:21.849
- If you need anything...
- I have the oregano. I have the parsley.

19:21.884 --> 19:24.765
I don't have butter,
but I can use margarine.

19:24.800 --> 19:27.227
What a relief. What a relief.
Well, this was fun.

19:27.262 --> 19:30.309
- I will bring this back to you later.
- No, no. You keep it. It's yours.

19:30.344 --> 19:31.342
Good luck!

19:33.669 --> 19:36.519
- How's Kevin doing?
- He's in love.

19:36.554 --> 19:37.464
Listen to this.

19:37.499 --> 19:39.461
This is, uh, news from around the world.

19:39.496 --> 19:40.963
Paris, France.

19:40.998 --> 19:44.644
There is an unsolved murder.
A woman was found strangled

19:44.679 --> 19:46.368
and both of her hands were cut off.

19:46.403 --> 19:48.204
- Oh, my God.
- No, it happens all the time.

19:48.239 --> 19:51.140
No fingerprints... makes it
harder to I. D. The body.

19:51.175 --> 19:53.746
Now, here's the thing.
They found the hands.

19:53.781 --> 19:57.084
They were a couple of meters away
from the body in the grass.

19:57.119 --> 20:01.174
The killer cut off both hands
but then left them near the body?

20:01.209 --> 20:02.321
Yeah.

20:02.356 --> 20:04.701
Yeah, she and her husband
both worked as curators...

20:04.736 --> 20:07.600
at the prison museum in the Bastille.

20:07.635 --> 20:09.267
Prison museum.

20:13.038 --> 20:14.364
Captain Duprat,

20:15.000 --> 20:18.551
There is a detective calling from America.

20:18.586 --> 20:20.683
He has solved the murder
of Madam Beaudreau!

20:20.718 --> 20:21.896
He solved it?

20:21.931 --> 20:26.085
By reading a newspaper.
From 9,000 kilometers away!

20:28.496 --> 20:30.940
Captain Duprat.
Prefecture de Police.

20:30.975 --> 20:35.636
Bonjour. Je m'appelle
Captain Leland Stottlemeyer.

20:36.014 --> 20:44.029
L-le Department de Police
de San Francisco.

20:44.064 --> 20:46.777
Uh, parlez-vous English?

20:46.812 --> 20:49.329
I speak enough.
What can I do for you, Captain?

20:49.364 --> 20:51.996
Hi. Uh, I have a friend here.
His name is Adrian Monk.

20:52.031 --> 20:52.814
Bonjour.

20:52.849 --> 20:56.117
He has a theory about
an unsolved case of yours.

20:56.152 --> 20:58.150
Here.
I'll put him on.

20:58.865 --> 21:00.432
He speaks English well.

21:04.103 --> 21:06.426
Hello. Bonjour.
Bonjour.

21:06.461 --> 21:08.511
Yes, I think I know
who killed Madam Beaudreau.

21:08.546 --> 21:10.824
Oui, Monsieur Monk.
What is your theory?

21:10.859 --> 21:12.315
I think her husband did it.

21:12.350 --> 21:15.205
Well, we suspected him
from the beginning.

21:15.412 --> 21:18.083
But why did he cut off her hands?

21:18.118 --> 21:21.776
He must have used a pair of handcuffs
from the museum to restrain her.

21:21.811 --> 21:23.115
I do not follow you.

21:23.150 --> 21:26.299
They were antique handcuffs...
very distinctive

21:26.334 --> 21:28.595
so they could easily
have been traced back to him.

21:28.630 --> 21:29.734
Mon Dieu.

21:29.769 --> 21:31.472
He must have lost the key.

21:31.507 --> 21:34.925
He was desperate.
He had to get them off the body.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.887
Well, that makes sense.

21:36.922 --> 21:40.008
Lafitte, why didn't I think of that?

21:41.191 --> 21:44.693
Monsieur Monk, you are a genius.

21:44.728 --> 21:46.891
Perhaps, sir, some day
you will fly to Paris,

21:46.926 --> 21:48.327
and I can thank you in person.

21:48.362 --> 21:50.566
Yes. Yes, that sounds like fun.

21:50.601 --> 21:54.713
I'll check my calendar.
Okay. Au revoir.

21:55.965 --> 21:57.039
Wow.

21:57.074 --> 21:59.938
You just solved two cases
by looking through one newspaper.

21:59.973 --> 22:02.781
I know, but we're not done yet.

22:02.816 --> 22:06.569
There's still something here
somebody doesn't want me to see.

22:06.604 --> 22:08.408
Ooh.
The personals.

22:10.186 --> 22:12.168
Can you move your hand?

22:12.351 --> 22:13.979
I already looked through that section.

22:14.014 --> 22:15.648
Nothing in it.

22:21.412 --> 22:23.660
"Man with a badge in
hot pursuit of romance.

22:23.695 --> 22:27.403
I'm 32, fit, sexy, ambitious,
with a dynamite sense ofhumor."

22:27.438 --> 22:29.586
Oh, my God.
That's you!

22:29.621 --> 22:32.286
Dynamite sense of humor?
Since when?

22:32.321 --> 22:34.662
Could I have that please? - No.

22:35.616 --> 22:40.054
"Looking for a petite blonde,
no nonsense attitude, kids okay."

22:42.139 --> 22:43.786
That's me.

22:45.108 --> 22:46.827
Don't flatter yourself.

22:47.573 --> 22:50.726
- How's your boyfriend?
- Why, you jealous?

22:50.761 --> 22:53.163
- He's so boring.
- Where is he now?

22:53.198 --> 22:54.870
He's fast asleep.

22:54.905 --> 22:57.907
- I wore him out.
- Yeah, I'm sure you did.

22:58.290 --> 23:00.350
Okay, let's be very careful here.

23:00.385 --> 23:01.828
Loose ends.

23:02.185 --> 23:04.081
Are there any loose ends?

23:04.116 --> 23:06.257
I don't think so.

23:07.245 --> 23:08.611
Oh, wait.

23:08.926 --> 23:11.443
I just thought of one.

23:27.185 --> 23:30.123
I think all the loose ends
are covered, darling.

23:37.866 --> 23:39.252
When did it happen?

23:39.287 --> 23:42.257
The M. E. Is saying two
and a half, three hours.

23:42.292 --> 23:45.500
He worked as the night manager
at the Stop-N-Go on Ridgedale.

23:45.535 --> 23:46.667
Oh, my God.
We were just there.

23:46.702 --> 23:49.176
That's where we bought the newspaper.

23:49.211 --> 23:51.685
The one with your letter in it to me.

23:51.921 --> 23:52.866
It wasn't to you.

23:52.901 --> 23:54.522
His shift ended at 4:00 a. m.

23:54.557 --> 23:58.547
He came here to make the night deposit,
and he got jumped by the killer.

23:58.582 --> 23:59.988
Stabbed twice,

24:00.023 --> 24:03.533
once in the neck,
once in the stomach, with that bottle.

24:03.870 --> 24:06.508
- No prints on the bottle?
- Nothing yet.

24:06.543 --> 24:09.085
- Surveillance camera?
- Negative.

24:09.120 --> 24:10.300
It's over by the A. T. M.

24:10.335 --> 24:12.837
It's facing the wrong way.
It didn't see a thing.

24:14.178 --> 24:15.924
Now, what I can't get over

24:15.959 --> 24:19.171
is that we haven't had a homicide
in this neighborhood for over four years.

24:19.206 --> 24:20.813
All of a sudden, we got two.

24:20.848 --> 24:23.422
First, your newspaper boy,
killed for a newspaper

24:23.457 --> 24:25.320
and now, this robbery.

24:25.355 --> 24:27.137
This was no robbery.

24:27.837 --> 24:30.080
What?
The killer took the money.

24:30.115 --> 24:32.609
The killer wants us to think robbery,

24:33.230 --> 24:37.122
but why wouldn't he do it
in a more secluded spot?

24:37.157 --> 24:40.642
He could have killed him anywhere
between here and the store.

24:40.677 --> 24:44.114
Maybe the killer just waited for
him here by the bank?

24:44.149 --> 24:45.403
No.

24:46.148 --> 24:51.766
No, the killer had to have
followed the victim from the store.

24:54.240 --> 24:56.498
Cream soda bottle.

24:56.533 --> 24:58.503
You can't find that brand anywhere else.

24:58.538 --> 25:01.323
Well, how do you know the victim
wasn't drinking the soda?

25:01.358 --> 25:03.500
He worked at the Stop-N-Go.

25:04.687 --> 25:07.263
- That's true.
- It's a woman.

25:07.298 --> 25:09.800
There's lipstick on the bottle.

25:18.635 --> 25:20.716
How did I miss that?

25:22.109 --> 25:25.293
She's stronger
and smarter than you are.

25:38.035 --> 25:40.202
The TV isn't working.

25:40.237 --> 25:42.173
I unplugged it.

25:43.476 --> 25:44.864
Why?

25:44.899 --> 25:47.189
I don't want any distractions.

25:47.224 --> 25:50.528
I want to concentrate on you.

25:52.550 --> 25:55.468
Here, eat.

25:55.503 --> 25:58.596
Oh. Uh, oh! Ah.

25:59.779 --> 26:01.761
Keep your energy up.

26:04.971 --> 26:06.460
You're gonna kill me.

26:08.149 --> 26:10.090
How did I get so lucky?

26:10.125 --> 26:14.008
Oh, I'm the lucky one.
Don't you know that?

26:14.043 --> 26:15.485
Vicki,

26:18.061 --> 26:20.101
I think I love you.

26:20.136 --> 26:22.062
Prove it.

26:26.886 --> 26:29.232
This is the same headline as yesterday.

26:29.267 --> 26:31.137
It's the same paper, honey.

26:31.468 --> 26:33.129
You're reading the same newspaper?

26:33.164 --> 26:36.565
It's part of a case we're working on.
It's hard to explain.

26:36.600 --> 26:39.430
Is it harder than opening a car door?

26:39.952 --> 26:41.809
Benjy!

26:41.844 --> 26:44.214
I didn't say anything, I swear.

26:44.249 --> 26:45.896
I heard Mom talking to Aunt Gail.

26:45.931 --> 26:48.726
Mom says you feel threatened by her
because she's stronger than you.

26:48.761 --> 26:51.336
- Benjy!
- What? It's the truth.

26:51.371 --> 26:54.080
Adrian, I'm sorry.
L... I didn't mean to...

26:54.115 --> 26:55.165
Hey, hey.

26:55.200 --> 26:57.041
Why don't you guys arm wrestle?

26:57.076 --> 26:59.765
- Yeah, then you'll know for sure.
- We're not gonna arm wrestle.

26:59.800 --> 27:01.309
- Well, why not?
- Because he doesn't want to.

27:01.344 --> 27:03.198
Sure he does.
He's not afraid of you.

27:03.233 --> 27:05.120
Are you, Mr. Monk?

27:08.633 --> 27:11.349
Okay.
Let's do it.

27:11.384 --> 27:14.868
Oh, boy. This is like Triple H
versus The Undertaker.

27:20.299 --> 27:22.549
Bring it on... over to me.

27:28.774 --> 27:30.503
Righty or lefty?

27:31.099 --> 27:32.560
Righty.

27:33.766 --> 27:35.935
Lefty, lefty.

27:36.232 --> 27:38.647
Wait. Righty.
Uh...

27:40.008 --> 27:40.856
right... lefty.

27:40.891 --> 27:44.095
- Let's just do it righty, okay?
- Okay. Hey.

27:45.932 --> 27:47.486
Are you sure you don't want to
wear a glove or something?

27:47.521 --> 27:49.226
Don't be ridiculous.
I don't need a glove.

27:49.261 --> 27:51.958
Why would I need a glove?
Wait.

27:51.993 --> 27:53.815
Let's just get this over with.

27:53.850 --> 27:55.731
Ready?

27:55.766 --> 27:58.005
Ready? Ready?

27:58.370 --> 28:00.035
Get set.

28:01.574 --> 28:02.657
Go!

28:16.786 --> 28:18.953
- Do you have to make that noise?
- It's not me, it's you.

28:18.988 --> 28:21.482
- I don't think so.
- Come on, Mr. Monk!

28:22.428 --> 28:23.647
Benjy, I'm your mom.

28:23.682 --> 28:25.740
Uh, come on, mom!

28:28.056 --> 28:29.881
- Hey, everybody!
- Hi.

28:30.240 --> 28:31.174
Who's winning?

28:31.209 --> 28:32.685
- I am.
- I am.

28:32.720 --> 28:34.861
Mr. Monk, I don't think
you've ever met Vicki before.

28:34.896 --> 28:36.852
Honey, he obviously can't
shake hands right now.

28:36.887 --> 28:39.309
Oh, it's okay. He's not big
on handshakes anyway.

28:40.496 --> 28:42.254
I just had to tell somebody.

28:42.289 --> 28:44.825
- We're getting married!
- Really? So fast?

28:44.860 --> 28:46.418
- When's the big day?
- Tomorrow.

28:46.453 --> 28:47.578
Vicki didn't want to wait.

28:47.613 --> 28:48.903
Yeah, I have a friend
who works at the hospital,

28:48.938 --> 28:51.096
so we don't have to
wait for blood tests.

28:51.131 --> 28:53.202
- Come on, honey. We're late.
- Okay. Holy Toledo.

28:53.237 --> 28:54.314
We've got to go.

28:54.349 --> 28:56.303
Tell me who wins.
Okay.

29:10.040 --> 29:12.570
Wipe! Wipe!
I need a wipe here.

29:15.701 --> 29:19.591
And the winner is...
Mr. Monk!

29:19.626 --> 29:23.996
- The guys rule and girls drool.
- That's right. Girls drool.

29:26.393 --> 29:29.011
Uh, say, don't feel bad.
You did good.

29:29.046 --> 29:30.021
You did good, really.

29:30.056 --> 29:32.694
You know, you... You had me
scared there for a minute.

29:32.729 --> 29:34.934
At least it's over.
Now we know.

29:35.861 --> 29:37.836
You're stronger than me.

29:37.871 --> 29:39.008
Hey, hey.

29:39.333 --> 29:41.469
You beat me fair and square.

29:49.388 --> 29:52.096
- Uh, she... she winked?
- It was definitely a wink.

29:52.131 --> 29:54.245
I think she let me win.

29:54.699 --> 29:56.160
Why does that bother you, Adrian?

29:56.195 --> 29:59.717
- You have to be the man?
- No, I don't have to be the man.

30:00.375 --> 30:03.916
But I would like to be mannish.

30:04.427 --> 30:07.236
I've been feeling so weak lately.

30:07.271 --> 30:09.273
Maybe I'm just tired.

30:09.496 --> 30:12.739
- I haven't been sleeping again.
- Why, is something wrong?

30:12.774 --> 30:16.824
My upstairs neighbor has a girlfriend.

30:17.795 --> 30:19.970
They're very friendly...

30:20.005 --> 30:25.091
very friendly all night long,
if you know what I mean?

30:25.126 --> 30:29.242
Yes, I know what you mean.
Now, I'm just wondering though,

30:29.277 --> 30:36.006
what's keeping you awake? Is it the
noise or is it what they're doing?

30:37.104 --> 30:38.668
What are you saying?

30:38.703 --> 30:40.349
Well, maybe what they're doing

30:40.384 --> 30:43.547
makes you think about Trudy,
makes you miss Trudy.

30:43.582 --> 30:45.831
It's something we've
never talked about, Adrian...

30:45.866 --> 30:49.107
your physical relationship
with your late wife.

30:49.142 --> 30:51.113
I consider that a personal question.

30:51.148 --> 30:53.568
Yes, it is.
That's what I do.

30:54.359 --> 31:00.362
L... I assume you
and Trudy were intimate.

31:02.689 --> 31:06.401
We held hands a lot.
All the time.

31:06.436 --> 31:11.090
Once we woke up holding hands.
We'd been holding hands the whole night.

31:11.363 --> 31:14.395
That's sweet. I like that.
That's nice. But,

31:14.969 --> 31:21.098
Adrian, is there anything else
besides the holding hands?

31:21.428 --> 31:23.326
Ah, I think we're out of time.

31:23.361 --> 31:25.731
No. Plenty of time.

31:28.170 --> 31:30.980
Are those pillows new? - No.

31:31.279 --> 31:32.823
They look...

31:33.321 --> 31:35.599
- ...new.
- Adrian,

31:36.036 --> 31:39.777
I'm your doctor.
I think this is important.

31:40.240 --> 31:44.577
Now, we've got 20 minutes left.
We... We could sit here,

31:44.612 --> 31:49.396
we could sing show tunes to each other,
or we can talk about your sex life.

31:49.431 --> 31:51.411
It's your call.

32:02.933 --> 32:08.185
¢Ü If ever I would leave you ¢Ü

32:08.220 --> 32:12.326
¢Ü It wouldn't be in summer ¢Ü

32:12.361 --> 32:15.638
¢Ü Seeing you in summer ¢Ü

32:15.673 --> 32:19.438
¢Ü I never would go ¢Ü

32:19.473 --> 32:23.108
¢Ü No, no, not in springtime ¢Ü

32:23.143 --> 32:27.354
¢Ü Summer, winter or fall ¢Ü

32:27.389 --> 32:31.949
¢Ü No, never would I leave you ¢Ü

32:32.324 --> 32:35.324
¢Ü At all ¢Ü

32:43.418 --> 32:47.211
¢Ü If ever I would leave you ¢Ü

32:47.246 --> 32:52.005
¢Ü It wouldn't be in summer ¢Ü

32:52.914 --> 32:55.989
"Pizza parlor.
Great business opportunity.

32:56.024 --> 32:59.212
By appointment only."

33:03.465 --> 33:05.348
The end.

33:05.681 --> 33:06.981
That's it.

33:08.841 --> 33:10.683
Nothing here.

33:10.915 --> 33:12.597
Nothing here.

33:40.872 --> 33:44.759
Sharona, meet me at city hall.
I know who killed the paperboy,

33:44.794 --> 33:46.362
and I know why!

33:50.284 --> 33:52.292
Adrian, Adrian.!
Sorry I'm late.

33:52.327 --> 33:53.563
I had to drop Benjy off.

33:53.598 --> 33:58.518
Sharona, it was right in front of us
the whole time, right on the front page.

33:58.553 --> 33:59.390
The lottery?

33:59.425 --> 34:03.272
That's what this whole thing
has been about... a $43 million jackpot.

34:03.307 --> 34:05.803
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Where is the justice of the peace?

34:05.838 --> 34:07.526
- Right this way.
- Justice of the peace?

34:07.561 --> 34:10.580
- You recognize these numbers?
- No.

34:11.422 --> 34:12.967
Will you slow down?
I'm in heels.

34:13.002 --> 34:15.156
Well, I knew I'd heard
these numbers before.

34:15.190 --> 34:16.728
I called Lieutenant Disher,

34:16.763 --> 34:19.096
and I asked him to check
his notes just to make sure.

34:19.130 --> 34:21.684
Remember when Kevin Dorfman
came downstairs after the murder?

34:21.719 --> 34:23.826
He started reeling off
his old addresses.

34:23.860 --> 34:28.521
Before that, I lived at
34 Warren Place for two years.

34:28.556 --> 34:31.920
Before that, 8 Todd Road...

34:31.956 --> 34:36.121
and 45 Radcliffe Street, consecutively.

34:36.156 --> 34:38.770
Sharona, Kevin won
the lottery on Thursday night.

34:38.804 --> 34:42.262
17, 26, 34...
these are his old house numbers.

34:42.297 --> 34:44.040
He played the same numbers every week.

34:44.074 --> 34:45.590
- A lot of people do.
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

34:45.625 --> 34:48.668
Kevin won $43 million?
Why didn't he say anything?

34:48.704 --> 34:50.007
Because he didn't know.

34:50.042 --> 34:52.275
He still doesn't.
But Vicki knows.

34:52.311 --> 34:55.591
Kevin bought his lottery tickets
at the Stop-N-Go every week.

34:55.626 --> 35:00.028
- Can I help you?
- Vicki, I would like my lottery ticket.

35:00.063 --> 35:03.191
After awhile, Vicki and the other clerk,
probably her accomplice, got to know

35:03.226 --> 35:06.566
- his lucky numbers by heart.
- I was also wondering

35:06.601 --> 35:08.142
- if you and I could...
- No way. - Okey.

35:08.177 --> 35:10.950
When the numbers were drawn,
they realized Kevin had won.

35:10.985 --> 35:13.861
They knew he lived alone,
that he didn't have many friends,

35:13.896 --> 35:17.635
and it occurred to them that maybe,
just maybe, he didn't know he had won.

35:17.670 --> 35:18.814
Vicki, come here!
Look at this!

35:18.849 --> 35:20.632
They came up with a plan.

35:21.014 --> 35:23.327
- Probably Vicki's idea.
- Why Vicki?

35:23.362 --> 35:26.445
- Because, the other guy's dead.
- ... $43 million.

35:26.480 --> 35:28.488
Oh, my God.

35:29.108 --> 35:30.389
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Bring your winning tickets

35:30.424 --> 35:35.321
to an Ultra-Lottery price checker
or an Ultra-Lottery retailer near you.

35:35.356 --> 35:42.199
Once again, the winning numbers are:
8, 12, 17, 26... - This is it.

35:42.234 --> 35:45.007
Later, on some pretext,
Vicki woke Kevin up.

35:45.042 --> 35:46.840
Kevin.
Hi.

35:46.875 --> 35:48.612
For a woman like her,
the rest was easy.

35:48.647 --> 35:53.715
I found these at the store.
I thought maybe they were yours?

35:53.750 --> 35:56.236
I didn't want you to be
without your glasses.

35:56.271 --> 35:59.136
Well, these are... these are mine.
I'm wearing mine.

35:59.171 --> 36:01.893
Oh, God. I'm so stupid.

36:01.928 --> 36:05.298
All Vicki had to do was keep Kevin
distracted for a day or two.

36:05.333 --> 36:08.350
She didn't let him answer his phone.
She probably unplugged the T. V.

36:08.385 --> 36:12.828
She didn't want him to see or even think
about the winning lottery numbers.

36:12.863 --> 36:15.589
Wait, I still don't get it.
Why did they kill your paperboy?

36:15.624 --> 36:18.003
They didn't know it was my paper.
They thought it was Kevin's,

36:18.038 --> 36:20.318
and they couldn't afford to
let him see this.

36:20.353 --> 36:21.997
It had nothing to do with me.

36:22.032 --> 36:23.549
Why didn't she just steal the ticket?

36:23.584 --> 36:24.912
The time stamp on the ticket

36:24.947 --> 36:27.450
would match the time code
from the store security camera.

36:27.485 --> 36:28.995
He could prove it was his.

36:29.030 --> 36:30.423
- They're getting married.
- Exactly.

36:30.458 --> 36:32.045
That was her plan
from the beginning...

36:32.080 --> 36:36.097
to get him to marry her
before he knew he was worth a fortune.

36:36.566 --> 36:38.784
If anyone present
knows of any reason...

36:38.819 --> 36:42.224
why this couple should not be wed
in holy matrimony, let them...

36:42.259 --> 36:43.737
- This wedding's a sham!
- That woman's a killer!

36:43.772 --> 36:46.891
She's marrying him...
for his money.

36:46.926 --> 36:49.825
Sorry.
I'm so sorry about that.

36:49.860 --> 36:52.368
- Oh, th-these things happen.
- Best of luck to you.

36:52.403 --> 36:55.718
Yeah.
I...I love your dress.

36:59.462 --> 37:02.075
All right.
Thanks.

37:06.533 --> 37:08.715
She said we're too late.
They left 15 minutes ago.

37:08.750 --> 37:10.154
She overheard them talk
about their honeymoon.

37:10.189 --> 37:11.145
That's it.

37:11.180 --> 37:13.586
- Well, where are they going?
- She doesn't know.

37:14.331 --> 37:15.679
What's the big deal?

37:15.714 --> 37:18.787
Kevin can just get his marriage
annulled when he gets back...

37:19.493 --> 37:22.069
which is an option
I should have explored. - No

37:22.104 --> 37:23.844
No, no.
You don't understand.

37:23.879 --> 37:26.066
Remember what happened
to her partner?

37:26.101 --> 37:28.656
Vicki Salinas is a cold-blooded killer.

37:28.691 --> 37:32.825
I think she's planning to
inherit that money, maybe tonight.

37:33.233 --> 37:35.004
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

37:36.224 --> 37:42.310
She said she saw them check out
those brochures just before they left.

37:45.325 --> 37:49.168
It looks like it's been restocked recently.

37:49.764 --> 37:51.250
Ten.

37:52.130 --> 37:53.777
Ten.

37:54.704 --> 37:56.026
Ten.

37:58.399 --> 37:59.661
Nine.

38:02.567 --> 38:04.968
"Dexter Cliff Inn."

38:05.003 --> 38:06.753
That's Pigeon Point.

38:06.788 --> 38:08.115
- Let's go.
- Okey.

38:09.843 --> 38:12.726
Hurry up, but not too fast.

38:14.443 --> 38:15.978
But hurry up.

38:16.013 --> 38:18.128
But not too fast.

38:18.163 --> 38:22.879
Mrs. Dorfman.
Mrs. Vicki Dorfman.

38:23.023 --> 38:24.492
How does that sound?

38:24.527 --> 38:26.473
Like a dream come true. - Huh.

38:26.508 --> 38:27.582
Here.

38:28.321 --> 38:29.523
Drink up.

38:35.916 --> 38:37.841
I think it's making me tired.

38:37.876 --> 38:40.127
Yeah, well, five Seconals will do that.

38:40.162 --> 38:41.454
Huh.

38:44.036 --> 38:45.637
Why are we stopped?

38:45.672 --> 38:48.916
Oh, you'll find out,
in seven minutes.

38:48.951 --> 38:51.096
- Drink up.
- Huh.

38:56.409 --> 38:59.730
I really do love you. - Yeah.

38:59.765 --> 39:03.901
Well, everybody
makes mistakes. - Yeah.

39:06.100 --> 39:07.566
What's that?

39:07.601 --> 39:09.408
Oh, it's my inheritance.

39:09.443 --> 39:12.027
My husband was killed
in a train accident.

39:12.062 --> 39:14.445
He was drinking.
He fell asleep at the wheel...

39:14.480 --> 39:16.005
on the tracks.

39:16.040 --> 39:21.551
- He was killed instantly.
- Oh, that's terrible.

39:21.586 --> 39:23.012
Yeah.

39:40.337 --> 39:41.905
Could that be their car?

39:41.940 --> 39:43.419
I don't know.

39:45.582 --> 39:46.968
Kevin!

39:48.213 --> 39:50.001
- Oh, my God, it's him.
- Kevin!

39:50.351 --> 39:52.749
- Kevin.! Kevin.!
- It's locked.

39:52.784 --> 39:54.175
Kevin, can you hear me?

39:54.210 --> 39:56.052
Are you okay?
Kevin, can you hear us?

39:56.087 --> 39:57.810
Kevin! - No!

39:59.157 --> 40:00.862
I'll get the switch!

40:02.746 --> 40:03.922
Kevin!

40:04.528 --> 40:07.616
Kevin, wake up!
Come on, wake up. That's it.

40:07.651 --> 40:10.078
Come on.!
Wake up.!

40:13.176 --> 40:16.828
Kevin, wake up.
What's the problem?

40:16.863 --> 40:19.103
- It's stuck!
- God!

40:19.138 --> 40:20.250
Come on.

40:23.100 --> 40:24.286
Oh, no.

41:13.795 --> 41:16.113
Your birthday's the ninth, right?

41:16.148 --> 41:17.595
What are you doing?

41:17.630 --> 41:19.093
I'm playing the lottery.

41:19.128 --> 41:20.752
You'll never win.

41:20.787 --> 41:23.470
You have a better chance
of being hit by lightning.

41:25.082 --> 41:27.463
Adrian, Sharona,
I'm heading out.

41:27.498 --> 41:29.436
Wanted to stop in, say ciao.

41:31.007 --> 41:32.523
Where are you going?

41:32.558 --> 41:34.668
Well, my place in Maui isn't ready yet,

41:34.703 --> 41:37.290
so I'll be staying at my house
in Aspen for a little while.

41:37.325 --> 41:38.239
Great.

41:39.093 --> 41:41.802
Have you heard from Vicki? - Who?

41:44.889 --> 41:45.852
Excuse me.

41:46.623 --> 41:47.955
Bonaduce!

41:48.358 --> 41:50.523
Yeah, what's happening, Danny Boy?

41:50.558 --> 41:51.467
Hang on.

41:51.502 --> 41:53.234
I've got to take this.
But listen.

41:53.269 --> 41:56.184
I wanted to give you a little something
for your trouble.

41:56.219 --> 41:58.001
Oh, no, Kevin.
No, I, uh...

41:58.036 --> 42:00.885
I can't take any money from you.

42:00.920 --> 42:03.238
Well, I can.

42:03.848 --> 42:04.886
Thanks.

42:04.921 --> 42:06.542
Take care of each other.

42:06.995 --> 42:09.098
And remember,
you gotta be in it to win it.

42:09.133 --> 42:10.022
Right.

42:10.408 --> 42:11.595
Right.

42:14.690 --> 42:15.752
Nice.

42:19.058 --> 42:20.481
$400?

42:20.516 --> 42:22.083
After I saved his life?

42:22.118 --> 42:25.046
You? I pulled the train switch.

42:25.081 --> 42:28.553
- After I loosened it.
- You didn't loosen it.

42:28.588 --> 42:31.702
It gave a little
just before you grabbed it.

42:33.809 --> 42:35.547
Why do you say that?

42:35.582 --> 42:39.461
- Why do you torture me?
- Because I can.
