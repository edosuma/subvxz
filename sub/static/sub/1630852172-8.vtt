00:22.397 --> 00:26.985
<i>I bet you can't even remember.
And that's how it should be.</i>

00:28.111 --> 00:30.363
<i>Because you don't exist

00:30.447 --> 00:31.990
<i>I'm your mirror.</i>

00:32.073 --> 00:34.743

00:53.678 --> 00:56.639
<i>you seem to still go on

01:02.228 --> 01:03.188
I took
the liberty of adding

01:03.271 --> 01:06.024
an extra shot for the girl
who was up all night.

01:06.107 --> 01:07.650
I would ask why, but I know

01:07.734 --> 01:09.277
the many answers
to that question.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.529
At least with Z,
I know what I did.

01:11.613 --> 01:13.782
But with Aki's dad's warning
about me, no idea.

01:13.865 --> 01:16.618
Partying with Miley during
her questionable <i>Bangerz</i> phase.

01:16.701 --> 01:17.827
I confused Jin and J-Hope
at the AMAs.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.163
I know there's no video
of me saying,

01:20.246 --> 01:22.207
"Don't you know who I am"
to security at the château.

01:22.290 --> 01:23.166
I checked.

01:23.249 --> 01:24.751
Maybe chamomile tea
would be best?

01:24.834 --> 01:26.503
It's like, what if it's not
something specific?

01:26.586 --> 01:28.004
What if it's just about me
in general?

01:28.087 --> 01:30.507
Like a ten-page exposé
about how I'm a terrible person,

01:30.590 --> 01:31.174
and I don't even know it.

01:31.257 --> 01:33.134
That's not possible, sweetheart.

01:33.218 --> 01:35.720
After what I did to my sister
with her boyfriend?

01:35.804 --> 01:39.057
With your ex-boyfriend,
which makes it more complicated.

01:39.140 --> 01:41.893
And you know it wasn't good,
which doesn't make you bad.

01:41.976 --> 01:44.020
And knowing Roger's
"newspapers,"

01:44.103 --> 01:46.815
I'm sure it's just some dated
conservative hate piece

01:46.898 --> 01:49.400
on the dangers of influencers
on today's young minds,

01:49.484 --> 01:50.527
and nothing else.

01:50.610 --> 01:53.488
I just don't wanna be the next
Lea Michele or Ellen,

01:53.571 --> 01:55.490
blindsided by something
I don't even remember.

01:55.573 --> 01:57.450
I can assure you
they weren't blindsided.

01:58.117 --> 02:00.203
We know who we are inside.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.330
There's nothing out there
that we don't already know,

02:02.413 --> 02:04.791
because we don't treat
people badly,

02:04.874 --> 02:06.793
and we own up
to our own mistakes.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.129
Sorry if my paranoia
kept you up.

02:10.213 --> 02:11.047
I was up anyway,

02:11.131 --> 02:11.965
arranging the set
for tonight's concert.

02:12.048 --> 02:14.300
Oh, you could do that
in your sleep.

02:14.384 --> 02:15.385
It's the 20th anniversary
for the label.

02:15.468 --> 02:18.054
You know, it's kind of a big
deal that they asked me,

02:18.137 --> 02:19.597
especially considering
that when I left,

02:19.681 --> 02:20.557
it wasn't on the greatest
of terms.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.475
You couldn't say no to Pink.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.394
Oh, by the way,
there will be passes

02:24.477 --> 02:27.564
for you and the crew.
And Lola's coming.

02:27.647 --> 02:30.733
Do you mean your fiancée?
I should hope so.

02:30.817 --> 02:34.070
I should have told you.
I've been worried it's too soon.

02:34.153 --> 02:35.572
More like "about time."

02:35.655 --> 02:36.948
Dad, you've been single
for most of my life.

02:37.031 --> 02:39.158
I need to know
that when I leave here

02:39.242 --> 02:41.619
in a year and a half,
you're not gonna be alone.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.246
- I've always put you first.
I know.

02:43.329 --> 02:47.625
And I love you for that,
but you deserve happiness too.

02:47.709 --> 02:50.044
You're gonna do great, Dad.
You have nothing to worry about.

02:50.837 --> 02:51.921
Neither do you.

02:53.673 --> 02:55.925
How about a small piece
of good news?

02:56.009 --> 02:59.220
Hmm, a portal opened up
to another world

02:59.304 --> 03:02.765
and sucked everyone I know
into it, leaving us here alone?

03:02.849 --> 03:03.850
Even better.

03:03.933 --> 03:05.435
Instead of having to scramble
for a new place to live,

03:05.518 --> 03:07.979
what would you say if I told you
next month you'll be waking up

03:08.062 --> 03:10.189
in a Greenwich Village
brownstone?

03:10.273 --> 03:12.692
Dad, I'm still
relatively new here,

03:12.775 --> 03:15.028
but I know even after COVID,
we can't afford the Village.

03:15.111 --> 03:16.112
We don't have to.

03:16.195 --> 03:17.947
A friend is letting us sublet.
Two bedrooms, too,

03:18.031 --> 03:20.366
though we'll have to
share a bath.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.118
A friend?
What friend do you know

03:22.201 --> 03:24.037
that has an apartment
in the Vill...

03:27.081 --> 03:29.792
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No fucking way.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.628
- We don't use that word.
- Yeah, you're right, we don't.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.504
Not about him.
He's not our friend.

03:33.588 --> 03:34.964
Davis is being generous,

03:35.048 --> 03:36.633
and we could both stand
to be more open-minded.

03:36.716 --> 03:38.343
Let's open our minds

03:38.426 --> 03:39.802
to the psychological
implications

03:39.886 --> 03:42.013
that come with-- with accepting
charity from two people

03:42.096 --> 03:43.973
who've been nothing
but awful to us.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.184
They're trying to help us.
That's not awful.

03:46.267 --> 03:48.227
- It's what family does.
- Family doesn't keep you

03:48.311 --> 03:50.772
from seeing your dying wife
and unborn child, okay?

03:50.855 --> 03:54.150
Family doesn't get you evicted
or-- or steal your boyfriend.

03:54.233 --> 03:56.402
If I could get past
the terrible things

03:56.486 --> 03:57.570
that Davis has done to me--

03:57.654 --> 03:59.572
You didn't speak to each other
for 15 years, okay?

03:59.656 --> 04:00.698
So how about I reevaluate
my relationship with Julien

04:00.782 --> 04:02.617
when I'm 30?

04:07.413 --> 04:09.999
Good morning, sunsh--
Who is that for?

04:10.083 --> 04:12.126
- Are you and Obie finally back--
- No.

04:12.210 --> 04:15.171
Because everyone thinks
that I'm a bad person,

04:15.254 --> 04:16.214
I am trying to make amends.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.054
Maybe with, like, Diet Prada,
but with her?

04:23.137 --> 04:26.015
Oh, my God, Julien.
She tried to delegitimize you.

04:26.099 --> 04:26.849
She actively worked against you.

04:26.933 --> 04:29.435
Only because I let her down.

04:29.519 --> 04:30.269
Honey,
you can't let down assistants.

04:30.353 --> 04:32.313
They're already
as low as they can go.

04:32.397 --> 04:33.982
Well, think of it
as spin, then.

04:34.065 --> 04:36.943
Because if something really bad
is about to come out about me,

04:37.026 --> 04:39.946
I need to show everyone
just how good I can be.

04:40.029 --> 04:43.700
So the best way to do that
is be a bigger person, right?

04:44.409 --> 04:45.284
- Right?
- Okay. Oh, my God.

04:49.664 --> 04:51.624
No thank you. I'm off salmon.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.543
Luna says
you have an apology prepared?

04:53.626 --> 04:54.293
Not an apology,

04:54.377 --> 04:57.130
but an explanation
for my behavior.

04:57.213 --> 04:58.464
This isn't couple's counseling.

04:58.548 --> 05:00.675
You're either sorry
that you gave up on yourself

05:00.758 --> 05:02.135
by handing over
all of your power

05:02.218 --> 05:03.469
to Buffalo Exchange,

05:03.553 --> 05:05.513
or you're ready to take back
what's rightfully yours

05:05.596 --> 05:09.267
by twisting the knife that
you already plunged in her back,

05:09.350 --> 05:10.977
ending her once and for all.

05:11.519 --> 05:13.021
I miss you, bitch.

05:13.104 --> 05:15.815
- Hmm. That's it?
- That's it.

05:17.525 --> 05:18.818
I'll think about it.

05:22.780 --> 05:25.408
Find anything out?

05:25.491 --> 05:27.201
Nothing. Your feed's so clean,

05:27.285 --> 05:29.412
you make Greta Thunberg
look like Jeffrey Toobin.

05:29.495 --> 05:31.748
Whatever is coming,
it is just gossip.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.666
Lies made up to sell to papers.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.585
Aki should just ask his dad
outright.

05:35.668 --> 05:36.711
I feel weird about asking him

05:36.794 --> 05:37.795
because things aren't great
with him and his dad.

05:37.879 --> 05:40.506
Well, he'll do it for you, JC.
You just have to ask.

05:41.257 --> 05:43.634
Second stop on the apology tour?

05:44.927 --> 05:50.224
Looks like that performance
has been postponed indefinitely.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.143
- Search my name on Reddit.
- Only if you promise

05:52.226 --> 05:53.269
to wash my eyes out
with hand sani after.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.438
I love you.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.941
Hi, baby.

06:01.235 --> 06:03.654
- Where's mine?
- You've had enough.

06:03.738 --> 06:06.282
Oh, that's why you left me
on read this weekend.

06:06.365 --> 06:08.868
You've had your fill
of being filled.

06:08.951 --> 06:11.329
I wasn't talking about you,
although I wish I was.

06:11.412 --> 06:13.331
I don't think
school is the best place

06:13.414 --> 06:13.456
for this conversation.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.125
No need to continue.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.586
I'm all good, <i>mes amis.</i>

06:18.669 --> 06:19.796
You know, I'm glad
that I could have been

06:19.879 --> 06:24.133
the antibiotic that you needed
to get you guys healthier again.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.968
And we thank you for that.
I do not remember

06:26.052 --> 06:28.763
the last time I've felt so calm,
and-- and collected,

06:28.846 --> 06:30.807
- and chill.
It's true.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.684
But now, I'm ready to get back
to seriousness, so...

06:33.768 --> 06:37.855
Same. All that solo time
has allowed me to, uh,

06:37.939 --> 06:40.316
conserve my resources
in anticipation

06:40.399 --> 06:43.694
for a rendezvous
with a ballerina.

06:43.778 --> 06:45.655
- Ooh.

06:45.738 --> 06:46.781
I'll, uh, I'll take a vid
for the next time

06:46.864 --> 06:50.368
- you guys hit a bumpy patch.
No need for that.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.370
- I think we're good.

06:52.453 --> 06:56.040
And now, if only you and Obie
could get back good

06:56.124 --> 06:57.166
- with each other.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.002
I wouldn't hold your breath.
And I bet he isn't either.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.380
<i>He's always been
this way, our Otto.</i>

07:02.463 --> 07:03.506
Ever since he was
a young boy, well,

07:03.589 --> 07:06.759
he cared more about the world
than himself.

07:06.843 --> 07:09.095
Sometimes to his,
or its, detriment.

07:09.178 --> 07:11.597
<i>"Detriment"
is a bit of an understatement</i>

07:11.681 --> 07:13.975
<i>regarding the uprising
that was instigated</i>

07:14.058 --> 07:16.894
<i>by your son outside
of the Navy Yard development.</i>

07:16.978 --> 07:20.565
<i>Everything is a learning curve
these days, for all of us.</i>

07:20.648 --> 07:23.526
<i>We spoke after the incident,
and Otto now understands</i>

07:23.609 --> 07:25.820
<i>that there's a time and place
to speak up...</i>

07:26.612 --> 07:27.738
<i>and a time and place</i>

07:27.822 --> 07:29.490
<i>-to wait your turn.
- Yeah.</i>

07:29.574 --> 07:32.535
He had very legitimate concerns
about our project.

07:32.618 --> 07:36.372
He just voiced them
in the wrong direction.

07:36.455 --> 07:40.751
<i>So, have those concerns
been addressed, Otto?</i>

07:40.835 --> 07:42.211
- Um, well, the--
- Yes.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.214
After he brought it
to our attention

07:45.298 --> 07:48.092
that we inadvertently displaced
a group of people

07:48.176 --> 07:49.844
experiencing homelessness,

07:49.927 --> 07:51.220
<i>we found a way to proceed
with the development,</i>

07:51.304 --> 07:54.390
<i>and a new and improved shelter.</i>

07:55.683 --> 07:57.560
There's a reason
that his father and I

07:57.643 --> 08:00.104
call him the family conscience.

08:00.188 --> 08:03.608
<i>Um, I would like to, you know,
personally apologize</i>

08:03.691 --> 08:06.652
<i>to the city of New York
for any destruction</i>

08:06.736 --> 08:08.654
<i>that my actions may have caused.</i>

08:08.738 --> 08:10.781
<i>That's certainly
not how I was raised.</i>

08:11.991 --> 08:14.160
<i>Uh, and so I will, you know,
from now on,</i>

08:14.243 --> 08:15.828
<i>go forward
with-- with that in mind.</i>

08:16.913 --> 08:19.665
<i>Okay. Well, we will see
what happens next.</i>

08:19.749 --> 08:23.211
<i>Thank you, Helena and Otto,
for speaking with us today.</i>

08:23.294 --> 08:25.213
<i>-Thank you.
- Thank you, Alisyn.</i>

08:25.296 --> 08:26.839
And we're clear.

08:29.175 --> 08:31.677
Articulate and remorseful.

08:31.761 --> 08:35.973
Now, do it again tonight at
our dinner with Roger and Aki,

08:36.057 --> 08:37.767
and we can put this whole thing
to bed.

08:37.850 --> 08:38.559
Aki's gonna be there? I--

08:38.643 --> 08:41.437
We're, like, weird
right now, Mom.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.940
Well, then apologize to him
before you get there.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.691
Apologize for what?
I didn't-- I--

08:46.651 --> 08:47.693
I did nothing.

08:48.277 --> 08:50.655
Why do I doubt that?

08:50.738 --> 08:52.073
Look, I heard about you
and Zoya.

08:52.156 --> 08:53.616
- It's for the best.
- Hmm.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.453
Grill at 8:00?

08:57.536 --> 08:59.914
Wear the Kiton
I got you in Milano.

08:59.997 --> 09:00.915
Brings out your eyes.

09:05.544 --> 09:07.838
I mean, I thought I
would sleep, but it was at 3:00,

09:07.922 --> 09:09.590
- and then I was, like, "What?"
- Sorry. What?

09:09.674 --> 09:12.051
I said, I couldn't sleep
last night. I was so excited.

09:12.134 --> 09:12.551
Today is the day, right?

09:14.762 --> 09:15.930
Early Hanukkah presents.

09:16.681 --> 09:18.266
Are Tamagotchis back?

09:18.349 --> 09:20.184
State-of-the-art security
to ensure no more coups.

09:20.268 --> 09:23.145
When you go to sign in to Insta,

09:23.229 --> 09:24.981
you'll need the code
from these fobs.

09:25.064 --> 09:25.731
It changes every five minutes.

09:25.815 --> 09:27.692
Can't I just use
the authenticator?

09:27.775 --> 09:30.027
Stronger security to not
have it all on your phone.

09:30.111 --> 09:31.320
Have you written the post yet?
Can I see it?

09:31.404 --> 09:35.283
- No. I'm not posting that.
- Are you crazy?

09:35.366 --> 09:36.659
That tip
is Anonymous-grade shit.

09:36.742 --> 09:41.497
That will level us up
from blind item to Ronan Farrow,

09:41.580 --> 09:44.166
minus the plastic surgery,
which I'm still considering.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.251
That tip was stream
of consciousness

09:45.334 --> 09:48.129
from a drunk and sad woman.

09:48.212 --> 09:50.339
There's zero verification
to back it up.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.717
No corroborating tips,
no legal filings.

09:52.800 --> 09:53.509
I-- it could literally just be--

09:53.592 --> 09:56.887
Gossip?
It's in the name, sweetie.

09:56.971 --> 09:59.515
You know what isn't?
Libel. Defamation.

09:59.598 --> 10:01.517
Or 17 other ways
this could go wrong.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.519
And that's just on us.
I mean, can you imagine

10:03.602 --> 10:04.437
what this would do to Julien?

10:04.520 --> 10:07.857
How is something
as inflammatory as this

10:07.940 --> 10:09.191
in service
of our mission statement?

10:09.275 --> 10:10.151
You mean the one that says

10:10.234 --> 10:11.610
to hold people
accountable for their actions?

10:11.694 --> 10:15.364
Which no one can do
if you don't get this out there.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.699
- Even if it's true...
- It's true.

10:20.411 --> 10:23.539
...it's way too complicated
and incendiary for a blind item.

10:23.622 --> 10:26.292
Should we ask our partners
in crime and punishment

10:26.375 --> 10:27.209
what they think?

10:27.293 --> 10:29.128
We brought those teachers on
as an alibi,

10:29.211 --> 10:31.630
- not a board of directors.
I knew you'd say that.

10:31.714 --> 10:34.216
- That's why I already told them.
- You did what?

10:34.300 --> 10:36.802
Which I agree
was a really bad idea,

10:36.886 --> 10:38.929
but we did bring them on
for a reason.

10:39.013 --> 10:41.349
Maybe they'll agree with you,
and then Wendy...

10:42.475 --> 10:44.602
and I will never bring it up
again.

10:47.271 --> 10:50.775
Fine. I'll hear them out.

10:50.858 --> 10:54.362
But at the end of the day,
it's still my decision.

10:54.445 --> 10:56.655
I got the tip.
I choose what we do with it.

11:05.081 --> 11:06.165
I just wanted to ask...

11:09.710 --> 11:12.630
I'm losing it, Ak.
Every time someone looks at me,

11:12.713 --> 11:14.465
I feel like they know that
I've done something horrible.

11:14.548 --> 11:15.925
I mean, didn't you?

11:16.008 --> 11:17.635
You're Team Z?

11:17.718 --> 11:19.428
- Twist.
- No. I'm Team No Team.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.180
I just think this whole thing
was an easily avoidable mess.

11:21.263 --> 11:23.766
It was. And I'm sorry.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.144
You wanna know
what my dad meant?

11:27.228 --> 11:27.937
When there's a target
on your back,

11:28.020 --> 11:29.605
it's hard to forget
that it's there.

11:29.688 --> 11:31.315
I haven't slept.
It's-- it's hard for me

11:31.399 --> 11:32.775
- to focus on anything, and--

11:32.858 --> 11:35.444
My advice? If you resolve
things with Zoya,

11:35.528 --> 11:36.612
maybe you won't even remember

11:36.695 --> 11:38.697
whatever my dad was talking
about in the first place,

11:38.781 --> 11:41.367
which...
...was probably nothing.

11:41.450 --> 11:43.119
They're agents of chaos.
None of it's real.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.664
But he is in town right now.

11:49.333 --> 11:53.295
Thank you.
And if I can return the favor,

11:53.379 --> 11:55.464
you and I both know that Obie
is not good with conflict.

11:55.548 --> 11:58.676
You're his best friend.
He needs you.

11:58.759 --> 12:01.011
Well, maybe I don't need him
right now.

12:16.902 --> 12:19.488
You're late. Now I'm gonna have
one less orgasm.

12:19.572 --> 12:20.489
It's only 10:00.
You don't go on until 2:00.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.825
Do not tell me that's a dozen.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.535
Even numbered flowers
are for funerals.

12:24.618 --> 12:27.121
- Okay.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.041
It's too late.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.543
You already cursed
my performance.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.172
If I break a leg today,
I'll have you killed.

12:36.255 --> 12:38.007
Really?

12:38.090 --> 12:39.800
Do you, uh, need some help?

12:40.718 --> 12:41.886
- Hmm?
- Hmm. Yeah.

13:01.447 --> 13:04.450
- Perhaps you cursed your own.
- Huh? What?

13:05.534 --> 13:07.995
Hold on.

13:11.957 --> 13:12.708
Maybe it's just the Adderall.

13:12.791 --> 13:15.336
Allow me to work it out
of my system.

13:27.806 --> 13:31.101
<i>I totally understand
your hesitation, Kate.</i>

13:31.185 --> 13:33.103
<i>First and foremost,
we're nurturers.</i>

13:33.187 --> 13:35.105
<i>And what this type of scandal
can do</i>

13:35.189 --> 13:38.901
<i>to the still-developing psyches
of these kids concerns me.</i>

13:38.984 --> 13:41.487
- So I hold off?
<i>-Hold off?</i>

13:41.570 --> 13:42.821
<i>Isn't this why you started this?</i>

13:42.905 --> 13:45.366
<i>So these monsters could get
what was coming to them?</i>

13:45.449 --> 13:47.493
<i>Why protect them now?</i>

13:47.576 --> 13:49.453
No, no, Kate,
you're sending that to everyone.

13:49.537 --> 13:50.871
<i>Oh, I see how it is.</i>

13:50.955 --> 13:55.000
<i>People disagree with you,
so you don't wanna talk anymore.</i>

13:55.084 --> 13:57.378
<i>You're not the activist
you claim to be.</i>

13:57.461 --> 13:59.255
<i>-Just another politician.</i>

13:59.338 --> 14:00.589
<i>I agree.</i>

14:00.673 --> 14:02.675
What do you agree with, Scott?
You literally just showed up.

14:02.758 --> 14:04.176
<i>Hey, calm down.</i>

14:04.260 --> 14:06.887
<i>Or whatever version of that
I'm allowed to say these days.</i>

14:06.971 --> 14:10.391
<i>The fear amongst us is
that you're no longer impartial.</i>

14:10.474 --> 14:13.018
"The fear amongst us"?

14:13.102 --> 14:14.937
Wh-- Have you been meeting
without me?

14:15.020 --> 14:15.729
I think what Wendy's trying
to say--

14:15.813 --> 14:18.190
Have you been meeting
without me?

14:18.274 --> 14:19.024
Of course not.

14:19.108 --> 14:21.360
But you did get close
with Zoya Lott,

14:21.443 --> 14:23.487
and I see the same pattern
beginning with Julien.

14:23.571 --> 14:24.446
Just because I care

14:24.530 --> 14:26.657
about what a young woman
might go through if--

14:26.740 --> 14:28.117
<i>See, that's the problem.</i>

14:28.200 --> 14:31.453
<i>You can't project human emotions
onto wild beasts.</i>

14:31.537 --> 14:33.289
<i>That's how they kill you.</i>

14:33.372 --> 14:35.791
<i>Instead of talking about
what could go wrong if you post,</i>

14:35.874 --> 14:38.377
<i>think about what could go wrong
if you don't.</i>

14:38.460 --> 14:40.629
If it's true.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.464
Why would she say it
if it weren't?

14:42.548 --> 14:44.633
<i>Why do we only post
what you see fit?</i>

14:44.717 --> 14:47.636
<i>We have to go after them
at every opportunity.</i>

14:47.720 --> 14:48.637
<i>If we don't if reinforces
they can get away</i>

14:48.721 --> 14:51.390
<i>-with anything.
- I agree.</i>

14:51.473 --> 14:53.642
<i>I know
you have a good heart,</i>

14:53.726 --> 14:56.520
<i>but it's time
for the hard truth.</i>

14:56.604 --> 14:58.147
<i>This thing is bigger
than you now.</i>

14:58.230 --> 14:59.898
Why are you here?
You aren't even--

14:59.982 --> 15:01.483
<i>I say we post the damn thing.</i>

15:01.567 --> 15:02.985
<i>Shall we take a vote?</i>

15:03.068 --> 15:04.445
We don't vote.

15:04.528 --> 15:06.530
<i>We do now.
So what should it be?</i>

15:06.614 --> 15:07.865
<i>Whether to post the tip,</i>

15:07.948 --> 15:10.117
<i>or deciding if Kate stays
or goes?</i>

15:10.200 --> 15:12.995
<i>Let's start with one,
and then mull over the other.</i>

15:13.078 --> 15:14.872
<i>-That seems fair.
- Democracy at work.</i>

15:19.585 --> 15:21.462
- I'll go.
- Yes, please.

15:21.545 --> 15:23.505
- Just--
No.

15:23.589 --> 15:24.840
- Just let me--
- No.

15:24.923 --> 15:27.384
- There's nothing you can say.
- There's gotta be something.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.928
That's what you people think.
Always under the assumption

15:30.012 --> 15:30.846
there's a way
out of your problems.

15:32.973 --> 15:34.683
But you're not buying your way
out of this one.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.394
- What are you talking about?
- Come on. Your dad's apartment?

15:38.604 --> 15:39.480
What?

15:39.563 --> 15:41.398
Whatever. If you're not
gonna leave, I will.

15:41.482 --> 15:43.067
I know I fucked up.

15:43.150 --> 15:45.444
I'm not trying to get my way
out of it. I just...

15:46.403 --> 15:47.363
I wanna make it right somehow.

15:47.446 --> 15:50.115
No, what you want is for me
to let you off the hook.

15:50.199 --> 15:54.662
You and Obie are perfect
for each other in that way.

15:54.745 --> 15:55.954
You both wanna be told
you're not as bad as you feel.

15:56.497 --> 15:59.124
So here's an idea.

16:00.209 --> 16:01.877
After school today, go home,

16:01.960 --> 16:05.381
put on your best
10,000-dollar poorcore,

16:05.464 --> 16:06.674
sit on your 40,000-dollar
mattress

16:06.757 --> 16:09.677
in your 15-million dollar
apartment,

16:09.760 --> 16:12.721
and rest with the knowledge
that you're the problem.

16:13.514 --> 16:14.515
You're broken, Julien.

16:14.598 --> 16:17.559
Just like your dad.
Just like everyone around you.

16:19.061 --> 16:19.103
You're right.

16:20.813 --> 16:21.980
Obie knew it. You know it.

16:24.149 --> 16:25.359
Even Aki's dad knows it.

16:26.652 --> 16:27.861
You know what else we know?

16:27.945 --> 16:30.739
You deserve
whatever you've got coming.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.453
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

16:36.537 --> 16:37.663
No, you're not.

16:43.502 --> 16:45.212
Yo, Aki, can we talk
for a sec, bro?

16:45.295 --> 16:46.922
How will you know what to say
without Mommy around?

16:47.005 --> 16:48.298
Come on.
That's not fair, all right?

16:48.382 --> 16:50.426
I did not want to do
that interview. I had to.

16:50.509 --> 16:53.095
Oh. And you and Julien,
you had to do that too?

16:53.178 --> 16:54.263
That's what you're upset about?

16:54.346 --> 16:55.264
I thought it was the--
the gay thing.

16:55.347 --> 16:58.350
- The gay thing?
- The bi thing, man. I'm sorry.

16:58.434 --> 16:59.309
Look, you know what I meant,
all right?

16:59.393 --> 17:00.811
No, I don't. And I don't think
you do either.

17:00.894 --> 17:03.564
I don't have a problem
with your sexuality.

17:03.647 --> 17:06.108
What I do have a problem with
is you thinking that I do.

17:06.191 --> 17:08.318
So my perception has to line up
with your reality?

17:08.402 --> 17:09.194
What are you talking about?

17:09.278 --> 17:11.113
It must be nice
to expect everyone

17:11.196 --> 17:12.823
to see the world
the way you see it.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.408
My world is not your world.

17:14.491 --> 17:16.034
My experience
is not your experience.

17:16.118 --> 17:17.745
And I wish you understood that,

17:17.828 --> 17:19.163
because then maybe you could see
how your actions hurt people.

17:20.914 --> 17:22.416
Zoya, me, Julien.

17:22.499 --> 17:24.293
Maybe in your world
you can explain that away,

17:24.376 --> 17:26.462
but in mine,
we're not friends right now.

17:26.545 --> 17:28.714
'Cause you don't see me.
You only see yourself.

17:31.759 --> 17:34.511
<i>Good morning,
followers. Trigger warning.</i>

17:34.595 --> 17:36.430
<i>This post will not be pretty.</i>

17:36.513 --> 17:38.474
<i>While I usually like
to have fun,</i>

17:38.557 --> 17:40.642
<i>this is no time for frivolity.</i>

17:42.186 --> 17:44.646
<i>And while this is
as of yet unsubstantiated,</i>

17:44.730 --> 17:46.690
<i>I cannot turn a blind eye
to this blind item.</i>

17:46.774 --> 17:47.816
- Jules.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.318
<i>I saw.
Meet me out front.</i>

17:49.401 --> 17:50.194
Jules! Where is she going?

17:50.277 --> 17:52.654
<i>It appears
a certain father</i>

17:52.738 --> 17:55.783
<i>to one of Constance's
most influential students</i>

17:55.866 --> 17:58.327
<i>is being accused of something
very serious.</i>

17:59.536 --> 18:01.830
<i>We've always
known this dad as dry,</i>

18:01.914 --> 18:05.083
<i>but he might have some bottles
hidden in his closet.</i>

18:05.167 --> 18:07.002
- You're distracted.
Huh?

18:07.086 --> 18:09.838
Is it someone else? Invite them.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.632
<i>One of them
allegedly used to ease a woman</i>

18:11.715 --> 18:14.218
<i>into a level of consent</i>

18:14.301 --> 18:16.804
<i>she had no intention
of providing.</i>

18:16.887 --> 18:17.846
<i>Being that I'm breaking
this news,</i>

18:17.930 --> 18:20.682
<i>I can't share anything further</i>

18:20.766 --> 18:23.101
<i>so as to not risk
my credibility.</i>

18:24.102 --> 18:26.063
<i>All I know
is there's a woman out there</i>

18:26.146 --> 18:27.147
<i>whose story should be heard.</i>

18:27.231 --> 18:31.109
<i>If she chooses to talk,
we all must listen.</i>

18:31.193 --> 18:34.696
This must be what my dad
was talking about.

18:34.780 --> 18:37.032
You need to find out
what he knows, now.

18:40.118 --> 18:41.078
Dad? Dad!

18:43.413 --> 18:45.457
Dad.

18:45.541 --> 18:47.000
Maybe try
calling him again?

18:47.084 --> 18:48.043
I've been calling him.

18:48.126 --> 18:49.044
It's going straight
to voicemail, which is full.

18:52.589 --> 18:54.466
- What?

18:59.471 --> 19:00.055
I'll give you two some space.

19:05.227 --> 19:06.728
Are you okay?

19:08.480 --> 19:11.817
I can't fathom what you must
be going through right now.

19:12.943 --> 19:14.027
Dad.

19:14.111 --> 19:17.072
If I were you, I wouldn't wanna
look at me, or talk to me,

19:17.155 --> 19:19.908
- or be in the same room as me.
- Dad.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.411
I wanted to tell you.
I knew this was coming.

19:22.494 --> 19:23.412
I just couldn't find
the right time.

19:23.495 --> 19:25.247
Dad.

19:28.041 --> 19:31.003
- Is it true?
- No. Of course not.

19:32.337 --> 19:32.921
But does that matter?

19:33.005 --> 19:35.173
My lawyers and I, we were gonna

19:35.257 --> 19:36.383
get out in front of this thing,
but that...

19:36.466 --> 19:39.261
school blog of yours,
they didn't give us any warning.

19:40.721 --> 19:41.763
You know, that woman

19:41.847 --> 19:44.725
who's saying these things
about me, I barely know her.

19:44.808 --> 19:46.727
I've never been alone with her
in my life.

19:46.810 --> 19:50.105
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I felt like...

19:51.607 --> 19:52.649
by talking about it,

19:52.733 --> 19:55.360
I would validate
her claim somehow.

19:55.444 --> 19:58.155
- But you do know her.
- Yeah, she's a manager.

19:59.364 --> 20:00.449
The first time I met her,

20:00.532 --> 20:02.576
she was Riley's assistant
a decade ago.

20:03.493 --> 20:05.787
The last time we spoke,
it was a dispute

20:05.871 --> 20:08.206
over some contract
renegotiation. I won.

20:09.291 --> 20:12.002
So... it's retaliation?

20:13.420 --> 20:14.212
Over money?

20:15.213 --> 20:15.339
Maybe.

20:18.300 --> 20:22.012
Fuck. Fuck!
This is going to destroy me.

20:23.889 --> 20:26.475
I can't dispute it.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.727
It would look defensive.

20:28.810 --> 20:29.811
And I wouldn't believe
me anyway,

20:29.895 --> 20:31.980
not after the life I've lived.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.107
But none of that matters.

20:34.191 --> 20:36.526
All that matters
is that you know the truth.

20:36.610 --> 20:37.569
I swear to you...

20:38.904 --> 20:41.823
on everything I love on my life,
on my work, on you,

20:42.491 --> 20:43.659
I did not sleep with

20:43.742 --> 20:46.036
or in any way take advantage
of that woman.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.583
If you don't believe me,
no one will.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.921
Of course I believe you.

20:56.004 --> 20:58.173
I hate that anyone
would even suggest it.

20:58.256 --> 21:01.510
I know you could never do
something like that. I--

21:02.052 --> 21:03.011
I know.

21:04.179 --> 21:05.973
Hey, we just have to hope

21:06.056 --> 21:07.766
that this thing
sorts itself out,

21:07.849 --> 21:10.352
and we can all find
some kind of peace again.

21:10.435 --> 21:12.145
Because while
there isn't an ounce of truth

21:12.229 --> 21:12.396
to Lauren's claim...

21:14.898 --> 21:15.190
she's clearly hurting.

21:17.234 --> 21:19.278
It's because of something
I must have done.

21:19.861 --> 21:21.697
It's okay, Dad.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.783
I'm here.
I'm not going anywhere.

21:28.328 --> 21:30.414
He's a monster, and I want
nothing to do with him

21:30.497 --> 21:31.289
ever again.

21:31.373 --> 21:32.958
I understand
why you feel that way,

21:33.041 --> 21:34.793
but you don't know anything
for sure right now.

21:34.876 --> 21:36.962
I know that I believe women.
And right now, I'm horrified

21:37.045 --> 21:38.213
my own father doesn't.

21:38.296 --> 21:39.256
Of course, I believe women.

21:39.339 --> 21:42.259
But I dedicated my entire life
to the principle

21:42.342 --> 21:44.886
that people are innocent
until proven guilty.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.139
Right now, there's zero facts
to base this on.

21:47.222 --> 21:48.265
It's an anonymous tip
on an anonymous Instagram.

21:49.808 --> 21:51.393
Okay. So... what?

21:51.476 --> 21:54.396
I wait to reserve my judgment
until his trial,

21:54.479 --> 21:57.607
where he gets off
because he has money and fame

21:57.691 --> 21:59.401
and a shit ton of NDAs?

21:59.484 --> 22:01.278
The system
you've dedicated your life to

22:01.361 --> 22:02.320
isn't exactly foolproof.

22:03.030 --> 22:03.989
Okay.

22:04.072 --> 22:06.950
But you know what's worse?
Taking gossip as fact.

22:07.034 --> 22:08.452
- For all we know,

22:08.535 --> 22:09.661
someone could be trying
to smear Davis's name.

22:09.745 --> 22:12.414
Smear his name?

22:12.497 --> 22:14.374
Do you know
how many sexual assault cases

22:14.458 --> 22:16.501
that are reported
turn out to be false?

22:16.585 --> 22:19.087
Between two and six percent.
I looked it up, Dad.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.757
Between two and six percent.
Why are you defending him?

22:22.424 --> 22:23.091
Is it about the apartment?

22:23.175 --> 22:25.093
Are you afraid
to lose free rent?

22:25.177 --> 22:26.636
No, of course
it isn't about that.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.221
Then I'm not stepping foot
in there, and neither are you.

22:28.305 --> 22:30.932
For all we know,
that's where it went down.

22:31.016 --> 22:32.267
Well, now you're just
being ridiculous.

22:33.393 --> 22:36.772
- What if the rumor was about me?
- It wouldn't be.

22:37.522 --> 22:38.774
But what if it was?

22:38.857 --> 22:40.776
Would you give me a chance
to defend myself?

22:40.859 --> 22:41.777
I wouldn't have to
because you wouldn't

22:41.860 --> 22:43.320
- do anything like that.
Don't you think

22:43.403 --> 22:45.280
that's exactly how Julien feels
about her dad?

22:45.363 --> 22:49.076
Call her.
Tell her you're there for her.

22:49.159 --> 22:51.119
- Hear her out.
- But, Dad--

22:51.453 --> 22:51.536
Now.

23:07.052 --> 23:08.261
So?

23:09.221 --> 23:11.556
I could not keep my eyes
off of you.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.558
Lie. I could see the glow
of your phone

23:13.642 --> 23:14.810
the entire performance.

23:14.893 --> 23:16.394
I admit
I was a skosh distracted.

23:18.480 --> 23:19.856
So you're leaving?

23:19.940 --> 23:23.193
I heard the news
after I-- I had already invested

23:23.276 --> 23:25.320
in some
performance-enhancing drugs.

23:28.448 --> 23:32.536
And I thought my solo
in <i>La Bayadère</i> was hard.

23:33.453 --> 23:35.789
Wanna go back
to your dressing room?

23:37.415 --> 23:38.583
Not necessary.

23:50.011 --> 23:52.013
How's she doing?

23:52.097 --> 23:53.515
You shouldn't be here right now.
She's in enough pain as it is.

23:53.598 --> 23:56.768
- Look, I just thought that--
That seeing the man

23:56.852 --> 23:59.062
who caused irreparable damage

23:59.146 --> 24:01.148
to one of the only familial
relationships that she has

24:01.231 --> 24:03.650
would somehow help her
right now?

24:03.733 --> 24:04.359
That's not fair, Audrey,
all right?

24:04.442 --> 24:06.194
That's not fair,
and you know it.

24:06.278 --> 24:08.446
- And this isn't about you.
- It never is.

24:08.530 --> 24:10.949
If I lie for her,
it blows up in my face.

24:11.032 --> 24:12.534
If I show up for her,
it blows up in my face.

24:12.617 --> 24:15.412
What am I supposed to be doing
that I'm not doing?

24:15.495 --> 24:17.622
You're always doing what
you're supposed to be doing.

24:17.706 --> 24:19.082
As your friend,
I'll say you should try

24:19.166 --> 24:20.750
doing what you want for once.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.839
What do you think
I'm doing here, Audrey?

24:25.922 --> 24:27.465
You're here to make yourself
feel better.

24:29.634 --> 24:29.676
Goodbye.

24:32.637 --> 24:35.891
<i>A woman
identified as Lauren Thompson</i>

24:35.974 --> 24:38.602
<i>has come forward, lamenting
that an Instagram account</i>

24:38.685 --> 24:41.146
<i>calling itself Gossip Girl
outed her</i>

24:41.229 --> 24:44.941
<i>before her lawyers had a chance
to take her accusations public.</i>

24:45.025 --> 24:48.028
<i>Now, Thompson alleges
that in October of 2011,</i>

24:48.111 --> 24:51.031
<i>while working with a purportedly
sober Calloway,</i>

24:51.114 --> 24:53.158
<i>he got her drunk
in order to coerce her</i>

24:53.241 --> 24:54.910
<i>into sexual relations</i>

24:54.993 --> 24:56.453
<i>she would not have otherwise
consented to.</i>

24:58.330 --> 24:59.414
Okay.

24:59.497 --> 25:01.791
Look, I used to do this
with my mom

25:01.875 --> 25:03.460
when one of her collections
would drop

25:03.543 --> 25:04.002
and the comments opened up.

25:04.085 --> 25:06.922
A no phone, no TV,

25:07.005 --> 25:09.549
and-- and no internet policy
all day.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.885
I want you to turn off
the notifications on your phone.

25:11.968 --> 25:14.387
Even the Google Alerts.
Because listen.

25:16.097 --> 25:19.226
JC, you think you wanna know
what these people have to say,

25:19.309 --> 25:21.102
but you never really do.

25:23.521 --> 25:25.357
- Have you heard from Aki?
- Mm-hmm.

25:25.440 --> 25:26.983
He just got to his dad's office.

25:27.067 --> 25:29.402
He's gonna find out everything
that you need to know.

25:38.536 --> 25:40.664
Everybody thinks I'm paranoid.

25:41.665 --> 25:45.252
Terrified of losing
one ounce of power.

25:46.044 --> 25:48.046
Well, occasionally...

25:50.257 --> 25:51.633
I wonder if they're right.

25:53.718 --> 25:55.887
And then my son...

25:55.971 --> 25:59.307
shares a private voicemail
with a room full of strangers.

25:59.391 --> 26:01.726
I was just trying
to protect my friend--

26:01.810 --> 26:03.603
Well, I'm just trying
to protect you.

26:03.687 --> 26:05.855
That's all I've ever done, Aki.

26:05.939 --> 26:07.983
I had no idea
what you were talking about

26:08.066 --> 26:09.025
was so monumental.

26:09.109 --> 26:11.569
That's because
you don't trust me.

26:11.653 --> 26:13.196
And after your recent behavior,

26:13.280 --> 26:15.073
I tell you,
I don't trust you either.

26:15.782 --> 26:16.658
We need to work on that.

26:16.741 --> 26:18.994
Yeah. We need to work
on a lot of things.

26:19.077 --> 26:20.954
Are you referring
to my news conference

26:21.037 --> 26:24.499
- about your sexual preference?
- It's not a preference, Dad.

26:24.582 --> 26:25.709
Aki.

26:25.792 --> 26:29.838
Our relationship
is very important to me, Aki.

26:29.921 --> 26:31.673
So is Julien's relationship
with her father.

26:31.756 --> 26:35.010
I need to know what you know
so I can help her.

26:35.093 --> 26:36.511
She doesn't know
what to believe.

26:36.594 --> 26:39.222
I've had a team of people
working on that story

26:39.306 --> 26:40.181
for months.

26:40.265 --> 26:42.350
They believed
that there was something in it.

26:42.434 --> 26:45.020
- Believed?
- The woman's account

26:45.103 --> 26:46.229
of her night with Davis
couldn't be verified,

26:46.313 --> 26:49.316
so we decided not to run it.

26:51.026 --> 26:53.486
I didn't think
there was any truth to it.

26:55.572 --> 26:57.365
- That's it?
<i>Apparently,</i>

26:57.449 --> 26:59.200
no one could place the woman
with your dad

26:59.284 --> 27:01.578
- the night in question.

27:01.661 --> 27:03.496
<i>Someone's just
after your dad.</i>

27:05.081 --> 27:06.249
<i>Are you okay?</i>

27:07.250 --> 27:09.336
I'm great. Thanks, Ak.

27:12.172 --> 27:13.423
I love your boyfriend.

27:13.840 --> 27:14.841
Come here.

27:15.508 --> 27:16.968
I know. I love him, too.

27:17.677 --> 27:18.720
Thank you.

27:18.803 --> 27:20.972
I don't know what I would have
done without you here.

27:21.056 --> 27:22.724
Maybe you, uh, would have
stress ordered Shake Shack

27:22.807 --> 27:25.477
under your doorman's name
then paid for his silence

27:25.560 --> 27:26.436
- in fries?

27:26.519 --> 27:28.146
- I told you that in confidence!
- I know.

27:28.229 --> 27:31.316
And I never told a soul.

27:31.399 --> 27:34.110
A best friend's work
is never done.

27:34.194 --> 27:35.653
So does that mean you'll still
be my plus one tonight?

27:36.571 --> 27:38.615
Oh, is your dad
still going to that?

27:38.698 --> 27:40.450
He better. If he doesn't go,
it'll look like

27:40.533 --> 27:42.869
the story's true,
and if I don't go,

27:42.952 --> 27:44.245
it'll look like I believe it,
and I don't.

27:44.329 --> 27:44.788
Yeah, of course. Of course.

27:46.331 --> 27:46.623
I'm gonna be there.

27:50.126 --> 27:52.587
I'm leaving.
Um, I'm keeping my phone on

27:52.670 --> 27:54.297
so if you wanna call me
or text me, okay?

27:54.381 --> 27:54.714
Bye.
- Bye.

28:04.391 --> 28:05.975
- Hey.
<i>I'm still mad.</i>

28:06.726 --> 28:07.477
But since I'm the bigger person,

28:07.560 --> 28:10.146
I wanted to make sure
you're okay.

28:10.230 --> 28:12.482
More than. My dad didn't do it.

28:12.565 --> 28:15.276
I just talked to Aki,
and his dad said that NetCorp

28:15.360 --> 28:17.112
couldn't verify her story.

28:17.195 --> 28:19.781
- Wow.
<i>It's awful, right?</i>

28:19.864 --> 28:22.325
But, you know, jealous people
will make up anything

28:22.409 --> 28:23.451
to try to take down
someone successful.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.620
- I can't believe it.
<i>I can.</i>

28:25.703 --> 28:28.456
<i>This type of thing happens
all the time.</i>

28:28.540 --> 28:30.625
You just never think
it's gonna happen to you.

28:30.708 --> 28:32.877
No, I just can't believe
you're letting him off the hook.

28:34.546 --> 28:37.257
He's my dad.
I know him better than anyone.

28:37.340 --> 28:39.008
<i>What about all the times
he lied to you?</i>

28:39.092 --> 28:41.469
His second apartment,
his secret girlfriend,

28:41.553 --> 28:42.554
the-- the stuff in the hospital
when I was born.

28:42.637 --> 28:45.306
Yeah, just like
your perfect life in Buffalo

28:45.390 --> 28:46.224
with your close friends?

28:46.307 --> 28:48.017
<i>Oh, my God,
that is so like you.</i>

28:48.101 --> 28:49.769
Deflecting instead of actually

28:49.853 --> 28:50.812
considering the reality
of the situation.

28:52.897 --> 28:53.648
Like father like daughter, huh?

28:53.731 --> 28:56.484
So much for being
the bigger person.

28:56.568 --> 28:57.777
I'm happy to settle with being
the better one instead.

29:05.493 --> 29:07.078
I tried, okay?

29:07.162 --> 29:10.165
But there's no way
we're moving into that ap--

29:11.583 --> 29:14.002
Ms. Keller,
what are you doing here?

29:14.085 --> 29:16.963
Um, your dad thought
you might wanna talk to someone

29:17.046 --> 29:19.466
who wasn't him,
if you have a minute.

29:24.095 --> 29:26.306
Can we get out of here?

29:26.389 --> 29:27.474
Julien won't even consider
there's more to the story.

29:27.557 --> 29:29.976
She just believes her dad,
like that.

29:30.059 --> 29:31.978
And I don't even trust the guy.
And I never have,

29:32.061 --> 29:33.897
but the more I've learned,
the more I feel that way.

29:35.857 --> 29:38.443
Honestly, do you think
I'm overreacting?

29:38.526 --> 29:40.737
I try my best not to police
other people's reactions.

29:40.820 --> 29:44.782
I mean, if it's how you feel,
it's how you feel.

29:44.866 --> 29:46.242
It's all so complicated.

29:46.326 --> 29:48.203
But why is it so easy
for the rest of the world

29:48.286 --> 29:50.330
to look the other way?
Have you been online?

29:50.413 --> 29:52.373
They're already calling
the accusations baseless,

29:52.457 --> 29:54.042
and it's only been a few hours.

29:54.125 --> 29:57.545
Look, that kind of response
is exactly what validates

29:57.629 --> 29:59.214
other victims' fear
that they won't be believed

29:59.297 --> 30:00.548
if they come forward.

30:00.632 --> 30:03.301
Perpetuating silence
only leads to more abuse.

30:03.384 --> 30:05.553
Wh-- what makes you so sure
he's guilty?

30:06.095 --> 30:07.639
It's Gossip Girl.

30:07.722 --> 30:09.557
I mean, even though
I hate to admit it,

30:09.641 --> 30:11.559
when has she ever been wrong?

30:11.643 --> 30:13.436
And you heard at Thanksgiving
what he did to my dad

30:13.520 --> 30:14.729
on the day that I was born.

30:14.812 --> 30:15.855
And did you know
he has a second apartment?

30:15.939 --> 30:19.108
That's how Julien find out
he was dating someone.

30:19.192 --> 30:21.194
He's had it for years,
a secret apartment.

30:23.363 --> 30:26.366
What are you doing?

30:26.449 --> 30:28.952
I just realized Gossip Girl
might like to know that.

30:31.371 --> 30:32.455
Um...

30:33.373 --> 30:37.168
As your teacher
and your friend,

30:37.252 --> 30:39.420
I believe
you should sit this one out,

30:39.504 --> 30:39.796
for your own good.

30:42.423 --> 30:44.509
If there's more to the story,
we'll hear about it.

30:44.592 --> 30:46.427
What if this is the more
to the story?

30:46.511 --> 30:48.096
Don't I have some kind
of moral obligation

30:48.179 --> 30:48.972
to tell someone?

30:50.056 --> 30:51.808
- She's your sister.
- Well, he's not my father.

30:58.773 --> 31:01.442
- What am I doing here?
- I am in crisis.

31:01.526 --> 31:03.486
We all are.
The accusation's insane.

31:03.570 --> 31:05.530
What? Oh. Oh, no, no.

31:05.613 --> 31:06.906
Not about Julien, no.

31:06.990 --> 31:09.659
Although terrible,
at least that was proven false.

31:09.742 --> 31:10.868
This is true. I couldn't do it.

31:12.537 --> 31:12.787
Do what?

31:15.748 --> 31:17.959
Oh, my God.
I came across town for this.

31:18.042 --> 31:20.628
Take a pill, or just close
your eyes like the rest of us.

31:20.712 --> 31:21.963
I did. It didn't work.

31:22.046 --> 31:25.967
I just kept going, and going,
and nothing happened.

31:26.050 --> 31:28.511
For me. She had a
fucking great time, obviously.

31:28.595 --> 31:32.473
But I mean, fucking... useless

31:32.557 --> 31:34.767
Like a--
like a jade roller or CBD.

31:34.851 --> 31:36.936
- What's wrong with me, Luna?
- You tell me.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.646
This problem
seems psychological.

31:38.730 --> 31:41.107
Oh, no, no, no.
I do not do psychological, okay?

31:41.190 --> 31:44.152
Which is probably
why you have this problem.

31:44.235 --> 31:46.487
Listen, I-- I've not banked
enough hours with a shrink

31:46.571 --> 31:48.781
to get to the root, okay?

31:48.865 --> 31:50.658
You know me well.
You be my therapist.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.660
I hate when it's this easy.

31:52.744 --> 31:55.371
The sex isn't working
because just sex

31:55.455 --> 31:57.123
isn't what you're looking for
anymore.

31:57.206 --> 31:59.667
You've been fucking
your best friends for weeks--

31:59.751 --> 32:00.918
messy-- and now
you expect to return

32:01.002 --> 32:04.380
to meaningless trysts
with psycho Slavs after that?

32:04.464 --> 32:06.049
You added emotion to sex.

32:06.132 --> 32:07.884
And once you get a taste
of that,

32:07.967 --> 32:10.303
nothing else tastes as good.

32:10.386 --> 32:11.554
So, what,
I can't have casual sex anymore?

32:11.638 --> 32:14.515
Of course you can, and you will.

32:14.599 --> 32:15.808
But right now,
your mind wants in

32:15.892 --> 32:17.602
on what your body's doing.

32:17.685 --> 32:18.895
Take the Slav out.

32:18.978 --> 32:20.688
See if you can find some
emotional connection with her.

32:20.772 --> 32:24.692
I bet if you do,
you'll be as good as new.

32:24.776 --> 32:27.362
- Better, I imagine.
- Okay. Yeah.

32:27.445 --> 32:29.322
- Okay.
- Do it.

32:30.948 --> 32:33.910
The group is meeting
at the Emerson at 7:00.

32:33.993 --> 32:36.496
- Meet me there?
- They're meeting? Why?

32:36.579 --> 32:38.873
To celebrate!
Have you not seen it?

32:38.956 --> 32:41.959
GG is trending.
The <i>New York Times,</i> CNN,

32:42.043 --> 32:45.213
<i>even NetCorp is sourcing us
in their coverage.</i>

32:45.296 --> 32:47.674
<i>And have you seen
our follower count?</i>

32:47.757 --> 32:48.549
<i>Just wait until you post
Zoya's tip.</i>

32:48.633 --> 32:50.927
Have you seen it yet?

32:51.010 --> 32:53.137
Uh, I haven't looked in a bit.

32:53.221 --> 32:54.847
She sent it a half hour ago.

32:55.598 --> 32:58.101
Davis has a secret apartment.

32:58.184 --> 33:01.145
She told me.
Nick asked me to talk to her.

33:01.229 --> 33:04.649
So you told her to send it?
Or you told her not to?

33:04.732 --> 33:06.734
This is all getting out of hand.

33:06.818 --> 33:10.071
I-- I'm just trying
to protect her.

33:10.154 --> 33:10.738
<i>Well, you can't now.</i>

33:10.822 --> 33:14.283
She sent it. You have to use it.

33:14.367 --> 33:15.118
I don't have to do anything.

33:15.201 --> 33:17.161
<i>What reason
would GG have</i>

33:17.245 --> 33:18.079
<i>not to share something that big?</i>

33:18.162 --> 33:21.207
If you don't,
Zoya could start wondering

33:21.290 --> 33:23.418
why her nice English teacher
and Gossip Girl

33:23.501 --> 33:24.711
share the same opinion.

33:25.962 --> 33:29.298
<i>Kate, this is
a real story.</i>

33:29.382 --> 33:31.884
This isn't teen STIs

33:31.968 --> 33:33.553
And by not posting,

33:33.636 --> 33:35.596
you're potentially
obstructing justice.

33:36.889 --> 33:37.974
Do the right thing.

33:40.935 --> 33:43.730
<i>Followers, it's been a day.</i>

33:43.813 --> 33:45.773

<i>Contrary to what you may have heard,</i>

34:09.797 --> 34:12.091
<i>this story is anything but over.</i>

34:13.509 --> 34:14.552
Dad?

34:16.053 --> 34:17.305
Dad.

34:17.388 --> 34:18.848
This is not good.
Not good at all.

34:18.931 --> 34:21.976
- No shit, PJ.
- It's time, D.

34:22.059 --> 34:23.853
No. I'm not doing it.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.981
- Doing what?
- Go after Lauren's credibility.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.274
She clearly wants to hurt you.

34:28.357 --> 34:29.650
Why won't you hurt her
in return?

34:29.734 --> 34:31.569
Because that is not the type
of person I am.

34:32.570 --> 34:33.946
You talked with Aki, right?

34:34.030 --> 34:35.990
Did he say why NetCorp Media
stopped pursuing this?

34:36.074 --> 34:36.949
We've been trying
to find out all day.

34:37.033 --> 34:39.494
They know something
that we don't know.

34:39.577 --> 34:41.662
Now, if that's why they dropped
the story,

34:41.746 --> 34:43.581
- it can only help us.
- I'll find out.

34:44.373 --> 34:46.501
But, Dad, get dressed.

34:46.584 --> 34:48.252
If I've learned anything,
it's that no matter

34:48.336 --> 34:50.797

you still show up, okay?

Listen, um, I have seen
more people in a dressing room

35:15.279 --> 35:16.322
than I see right now.
Don't worry about it.

35:16.405 --> 35:18.533
Gossip Girl doesn't have
the reach we thought she did.

35:18.616 --> 35:20.493
- Clearly.
- Yeah.

35:20.576 --> 35:21.244
Let's do a story

35:21.327 --> 35:23.037

35:39.971 --> 35:42.056
I've been
putting on a face all day,

35:42.139 --> 35:43.975
but a part of me just
wants to go home

35:44.058 --> 35:46.269
and cry
under my weighted blanket.

35:47.478 --> 35:51.357

this is just jealousy, right?

Well, I know you know, because
you're hot and famous too.

36:10.668 --> 36:12.253

The other night,
when he finally told me

36:16.799 --> 36:17.758
this was all coming out,
he tried to break up with me.

36:17.842 --> 36:21.095

36:21.178 --> 36:23.431
to be dragged down
by all of this.

36:23.514 --> 36:26.392
He said he couldn't do it
in good conscience unless,

36:26.475 --> 36:29.437
you know,
we walked the engagement back.

36:29.520 --> 36:31.397
He wanted me to know
that marrying me

36:31.480 --> 36:34.942
wasn't about publicity
or covering something up.

36:35.026 --> 36:38.654
He wants to wait to propose
until this is all over.

- Mm-hmm. Sure.
- Are you sure?

37:51.143 --> 37:52.186
Yeah. I just said "sure."

Great. Cool.

You know, they used
to have a Picasso here.

38:11.622 --> 38:14.166
Huge thing. Tapestry.

38:14.250 --> 38:16.419
It was on that wall over there
for nearly 60 years.

38:19.797 --> 38:21.132
I ate here a lot in those years.

38:21.215 --> 38:26.262

like it was nothing.

I need a favor.
Um, more information.

38:44.488 --> 38:47.450
You know
why I'm telling you this story?

38:47.533 --> 38:50.202
Because when they came
to get rid of it,

38:50.286 --> 38:53.247
they asked me
if I wanted to buy it.

38:53.330 --> 38:56.125
And, of course,
they knew how fond I was of it.

38:57.460 --> 38:57.543
But I knew...

38:59.295 --> 39:00.671
I instantly knew...

39:01.672 --> 39:04.008
that if that Picasso
was for sale...

39:05.092 --> 39:06.427
then it had no value.

39:07.511 --> 39:08.888
If it could be anyone's,

39:10.097 --> 39:10.347
it was worthless.

39:11.891 --> 39:14.685
I gave you information.

39:14.769 --> 39:17.605
Important information.
What do you do?

39:17.688 --> 39:20.441
You give it to your friend
to make her feel better.

39:20.524 --> 39:21.609
She deserved to know.

39:21.692 --> 39:24.195
Her father's
got his own lawyers.

39:24.278 --> 39:27.448
Lawyers who've been
pestering my people all day

39:27.531 --> 39:29.825
trying to reveal their sources.

39:29.909 --> 39:32.870
When you give up information,

39:32.953 --> 39:36.957
you alert people... to know
that you are for sale.

39:41.087 --> 39:41.378
Are you for sale?

39:43.672 --> 39:44.632
No.

39:47.051 --> 39:49.428
You let your friends
manipulate you,

39:49.512 --> 39:52.723
use you to better themselves.
That makes you weak.

39:54.391 --> 39:57.853
I love that you're good.
I love that you're kind.

39:57.937 --> 40:00.231
I don't even mind you're gay.

40:00.314 --> 40:06.112
But please don't be weak.
That's unforgivable.

40:07.988 --> 40:12.159
Oh, Helena, Otto.
How lovely of you to join us.

40:12.243 --> 40:14.328
- Hello, Mr. Menzies.
Oh, yeah. Nice.

40:14.411 --> 40:15.955
Nice to see you.
Oh.

40:16.747 --> 40:19.083
Hey, what's going on?

40:19.875 --> 40:21.252
Wendy told us

40:21.335 --> 40:24.505
that you didn't want to post
Zoya's tip.

40:24.588 --> 40:26.423
- Is that true?
- Of course it's true.

40:27.758 --> 40:31.720
So? This is my project.
I invited you all in.

40:31.804 --> 40:33.389
- It's all our project.
No.

40:33.472 --> 40:35.391
I'm the one who thinks about it
day and night.

40:35.474 --> 40:38.185
I'm the one who gets the tips

40:38.269 --> 40:40.354
and decides what's right
from what's rumor.

40:40.437 --> 40:43.190
Only because you don't include
us in the process.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.818
None of you cared about any
of this until yesterday.

40:45.901 --> 40:48.112
You didn't have anything
good till yesterday.

40:49.613 --> 40:51.574
So, um...

40:51.657 --> 40:55.369
uh... you all want to be more
a part of the process.

40:55.452 --> 40:58.455
Uh. Yeah, we can, um,
we can meet,

40:58.539 --> 41:00.875
uh, discuss the tips
before I post them.

41:00.958 --> 41:03.586
- Come up with a plan together.
- That's not the issue here.

41:03.669 --> 41:05.921
You've stopped
living your mission statement.

41:06.005 --> 41:07.631
You care too much
about these kids.

41:07.715 --> 41:10.259
You're no longer
correcting the problem.

41:10.342 --> 41:11.469
- You're a part of it.
- Sharon...

41:13.429 --> 41:15.431
Where's Jordan?
When he gets here, he'll...

41:19.393 --> 41:22.146
Okay. She's not here.
I told you.

41:22.229 --> 41:23.230
Maybe she's backstage.

41:23.314 --> 41:27.401
♪ ("APRICOTS"
BY BICEP PLAYING) ♪

41:27.484 --> 41:30.070
- Go.
- Dad, I just don't understand

41:30.154 --> 41:31.614
how you can still defend
these horrible people.

41:33.574 --> 41:34.408
Horrible people?

41:34.491 --> 41:37.328
The only horrible person here
is you.

41:37.411 --> 41:39.205
Publicly defaming someone
you barely even know

41:39.288 --> 41:40.915
because you're mad
your boyfriend's
still in love with me.

41:40.998 --> 41:42.374
This has nothing to do
with Obie.

41:42.458 --> 41:44.418
It has everything to do
with Obie.

41:44.501 --> 41:46.086
I may have gone about this
the wrong way.

41:46.170 --> 41:47.129
I can admit that.

41:47.213 --> 41:49.673
I shouldn't have sent that tip
in to Gossip Girl.

41:49.757 --> 41:52.092
But the thing is,
even though you did
something terrible to me,

41:52.176 --> 41:53.469
you were right to.

41:53.552 --> 41:55.930
Obie doesn't love me.
He and I shouldn't be together.

41:56.013 --> 41:57.056
Who knows how much longer
I would have gone

41:57.139 --> 42:00.309
without realizing that?
I could have made a huge mistake

42:00.392 --> 42:02.394
I would have regretted
my entire life.

42:02.478 --> 42:05.356
So, while what you did to me
really fucking hurt...

42:05.439 --> 42:07.524
it opened my eyes
before it was too late, okay?

42:07.608 --> 42:08.609
And that's all that I'm trying
to do for you.

42:08.692 --> 42:12.112
- We need to go already.
- I know him better than you.

42:13.489 --> 42:15.324
How are you so sure
he's such a monster?

42:15.407 --> 42:18.452
What he did to Mom,
to my dad, to us,

42:18.535 --> 42:21.163
keeping us apart for 15 years,
that's still inside him.

42:21.705 --> 42:23.249
He got sober, Z.

42:23.332 --> 42:25.084
He wasn't acting entirely clear
back then.

42:25.167 --> 42:26.961
- How do you know?
- Let's go get a drink.

42:27.044 --> 42:28.629
- Come on.
- My dad's set's about to start.

42:28.712 --> 42:30.047
Come on. Let's go see it.

42:31.423 --> 42:34.760
All these white men
have the same haircut.

42:34.843 --> 42:36.762
We're definitely still
in Williamsburg.

42:36.845 --> 42:38.639
- Yeah.
- And they only have IPAs?

42:38.722 --> 42:41.892
I told you nobody's
gonna have good coke here.

42:43.269 --> 42:45.771
- Zoya's here?
- She's so cute.

42:45.854 --> 42:47.856
I would like to culturally
appropriate her.

42:47.940 --> 42:49.483
- Listen, I'm gonna pee,

42:49.567 --> 42:50.567
unless you want me to save it
for later.

42:52.903 --> 42:53.487
No.

42:53.570 --> 42:55.656
- Okay.
- Thank you, though.

43:00.286 --> 43:03.247
You just missed the telenovela.

43:03.330 --> 43:07.418
- Having a good night, I see?
- Good night? Uh, well...

43:07.501 --> 43:08.335
she told me so much
about her life

43:08.419 --> 43:10.838
that it's taken years off
of mine.

43:10.921 --> 43:13.549
I had no choice but to take her
to the restaurant bathroom

43:13.632 --> 43:17.803
just to shut her up.
It didn't work... again.

43:18.929 --> 43:20.264
Have you thought about how maybe

43:20.347 --> 43:23.058
it isn't that
you can't fuck her,

43:23.142 --> 43:24.810
it's that you no longer want to?

43:25.686 --> 43:27.521
That is definitely true now,
yeah.

43:28.480 --> 43:29.940
It's possible
you may have feelings

43:30.024 --> 43:32.026
for someone else.

43:32.776 --> 43:34.611
Or should I say, "someones."

43:46.040 --> 43:47.791
So, Otto,
I hear you have something

43:47.875 --> 43:51.045
you wanna tell me.
Shall we dispense with it?

43:53.380 --> 43:54.381
No.

43:55.716 --> 43:57.718
What?
- I said, "No."

43:57.801 --> 44:00.012
- Otto?
Mother.

44:00.095 --> 44:02.348
Apologize to Roger.
That's why you're here.

44:03.474 --> 44:04.725
No.

44:04.808 --> 44:08.771
- You said you'd apologize.
- I didn't actually say that.

44:08.854 --> 44:09.313
Are you really doing this?

44:09.396 --> 44:11.940
How does saying no feel?

44:12.024 --> 44:14.610
Uh, it feels
pretty fucking good honestly.

44:14.693 --> 44:15.402
Think I'm gonna try it out.

44:15.486 --> 44:18.238
- Hey, that's enough of that.
- No.

44:19.656 --> 44:22.034
You both are behaving
like children.

44:22.117 --> 44:23.577
You owe Roger an apology.

44:23.660 --> 44:26.372
- For what, exactly?
- Yeah. What did he do?

44:26.455 --> 44:29.166
He caused a scene in public,

44:29.249 --> 44:31.668
which impacted your father
in a negative manner.

44:31.752 --> 44:33.837
Nothing impacts my father
in a negative manner.

44:33.921 --> 44:36.840
Yeah, you know, and I--
Look. I mean, I have...

44:38.342 --> 44:41.261
done bad things.
Recently, too, you know?

44:42.513 --> 44:45.766
But... standing up
for what I believe in...

44:47.059 --> 44:48.227
is not one of them.

44:48.852 --> 44:49.770
I mean, cheating on my--

44:49.853 --> 44:52.398
you know, on my girlfriend,
that probably was.

44:52.815 --> 44:54.316
And, uh...

44:54.400 --> 44:57.528
you know, failing to see
that I hurt my best friend was.

44:57.611 --> 44:59.655
And I'm not telling you
how I really feel

44:59.738 --> 45:03.575
about all of this,
that certainly is. Um...

45:05.077 --> 45:08.330
I mean, do you even
like this restaurant, Aki?

45:08.414 --> 45:10.707
No.
- Cool, 'cause I don't either.

45:10.791 --> 45:11.625
I mean, I think we should leave
and, uh,

45:11.708 --> 45:13.502
get some pizza, actually.

45:13.585 --> 45:15.587
Both of you,
sit down this instant.

45:15.671 --> 45:18.465
I'm tired of being
your conscience.

45:19.675 --> 45:21.927
Mom, just grow your own.

45:22.010 --> 45:24.221
Being there for your friends
isn't weak.

45:25.097 --> 45:26.515
Not being there for them is.

45:27.808 --> 45:31.478
I'm gonna order a black car
to, uh, Obie's. On you, okay?

45:34.440 --> 45:36.191
Wait, what? He gets to keep his?

45:36.275 --> 45:37.568
Of course.

45:38.861 --> 45:39.695
Huh.

45:50.914 --> 45:54.460
-♪ ♪

45:58.755 --> 46:01.425
There's something
I need you to know, Z.

46:02.634 --> 46:05.554
What you said back there
about Davis keeping you

46:05.637 --> 46:07.431
and your sister apart
of your whole lives...

46:07.514 --> 46:07.764
that wasn't him.

46:09.183 --> 46:10.934
That was me.

46:12.769 --> 46:15.606
When you were five,
he wrote me a letter...

46:15.689 --> 46:17.399
about how sorry he had been
for what he had done

46:17.483 --> 46:19.818
the day you were born.

46:19.902 --> 46:22.613
How sorry he was for everything.

46:22.696 --> 46:25.657
He said that he knew
that I could never forgive him.

46:25.741 --> 46:27.534
And that he could never
forgive himself

46:27.618 --> 46:29.077
if he stood in the way
of you and your sister

46:29.161 --> 46:30.454
being apart your whole lives.

46:32.831 --> 46:34.082
And you know what I did?

46:35.792 --> 46:36.793
I threw it away.

46:38.545 --> 46:38.712
Never responded.

46:41.924 --> 46:43.759
So he started calling.
And I didn't answer.

46:45.886 --> 46:47.137
But he kept trying.

46:49.556 --> 46:52.476
I'm the one
who didn't change, Z.

46:52.559 --> 46:54.811
Not him. And I'm sorry
you have to see that now.

46:54.895 --> 46:58.398
Z, I need you. Can we put
our shit aside for a second?

46:58.482 --> 47:01.693
- Can I borrow her for a minute?
- Where are we going?

47:01.777 --> 47:03.362
- You're on their side?
It's not about sides.

47:03.445 --> 47:04.905
You can't be part of them.

47:04.988 --> 47:07.991
They're trying to stage a coup
because they're lonely and--

47:08.075 --> 47:09.826
They're right.
You're too close, Kate.

47:11.161 --> 47:12.746
That's not true.

47:12.829 --> 47:16.250
You're so close, you can't even
see how true it is.

47:16.333 --> 47:18.418
This thing, this experiment,

47:18.502 --> 47:19.503
at first,
I thought it was crazy.

47:19.586 --> 47:21.588
I figured it would last a week.
Maybe two, until you saw

47:21.672 --> 47:24.216
there was no way
to change things, but...

47:25.217 --> 47:26.760
you did change things.

47:26.843 --> 47:28.762
Rafa was wrong.
The kids have gotten better.

47:28.846 --> 47:33.392
More polite, more aware,
more afraid of us.

47:34.643 --> 47:36.645
But when you start
pulling punches

47:36.728 --> 47:38.272
and editing the truth

47:38.355 --> 47:39.773
and trying to solve it
personally,

47:39.856 --> 47:42.359
you ruin the integrity
of the idea.

47:42.442 --> 47:44.236
You insert yourself
in the narrative

47:44.319 --> 47:45.237
instead of what
you're supposed to do,

47:45.320 --> 47:48.365
observe and report
and leave the rest to them.

47:50.784 --> 47:50.867
You're right.

47:53.203 --> 47:56.790
Um... okay.
Uh, from now on,

47:56.873 --> 48:01.628
I will just post everything
and stay out of it.

48:01.712 --> 48:03.964
I'm afraid
that won't be enough for us.

48:04.047 --> 48:06.258
We'll, uh, take it from here.

48:09.428 --> 48:10.971
Consider it a leave of absence.

48:12.055 --> 48:14.224
I'm sorry, Kate,
but I'm gonna need your fob.

48:21.148 --> 48:23.734
All right, yes,
it made me feel a little weird

48:23.817 --> 48:26.028
- when you told me.
- Thank you.

48:26.111 --> 48:28.739
I don't know...
what it was, man.

48:28.822 --> 48:30.616
You know, I think
I started to wonder, like...

48:31.241 --> 48:32.409
what it all meant,

48:32.492 --> 48:34.077
all the times we hung out,
just the two of us,

48:34.161 --> 48:35.662
and, you know, stayed
at each other's houses,

48:35.746 --> 48:36.747
slept in the same beds
when we were on vacation.

48:36.830 --> 48:39.416
You wondered
if I ever had a thing for you?

48:41.752 --> 48:44.338
I did. Yeah, I did.
And it's stupid.

48:44.421 --> 48:46.340
I know.
And I'm-- I'm sorry.

48:46.423 --> 48:49.468
It is stupid. And no offense,
but I never did.

48:50.469 --> 48:51.470
You ne...

48:52.179 --> 48:53.930
I'm-- I'm, like-- I'm hurt.

48:54.014 --> 48:55.515
- Is that weird?

48:59.019 --> 48:59.478
- I miss you.

48:59.561 --> 49:01.647
I miss you too, man.

49:03.023 --> 49:05.609
- God, our parents.
- The look on your mother's face.

49:05.692 --> 49:07.194
No, the look on your dad's face,
bro.

49:07.277 --> 49:09.363
I cannot believe
that he let you touch his phone.

49:09.446 --> 49:10.364
I was trying so hard
not to shake

49:10.447 --> 49:12.032
- when I was going through
his emails.
- Yeah?

49:12.115 --> 49:15.869
Part of me wanted to go
send it straight to Gossip Girl.

49:15.952 --> 49:17.829
Did you find
what Jules needed?

49:17.913 --> 49:20.207
I don't know.
I just forwarded everything

49:20.290 --> 49:22.542
that said "Calloway"
and "source."

49:22.626 --> 49:24.711
But I didn't get to read
much of it.

49:24.795 --> 49:27.422
Well, maybe our parents
need a Gossip Girl of their own.

49:27.506 --> 49:29.549
Isn't that my dad's papers?

49:29.633 --> 49:31.802
I mean, not that it matters,
but look at Trump.

49:31.885 --> 49:34.137
He got away with everything
that he did.

49:34.221 --> 49:36.223
Except for his tax returns.
That's the only thing

49:36.306 --> 49:38.600
- that seems to have rattled him.

49:39.768 --> 49:40.769
It's Audrey.

49:40.852 --> 49:42.979
I'm gonna tell her to
come over to your place, okay?

49:43.689 --> 49:44.690
Yeah.

49:48.985 --> 49:50.529
If I knew
what you're looking for,

49:50.612 --> 49:52.614
- I could help you.
- I don't know if it's here,

49:52.698 --> 49:54.574
or if it'll even tell me
anything,

49:54.658 --> 49:56.284
or if I'm just being crazy.

49:56.368 --> 49:58.995
Julien, what did-- what did
Roger's email say exactly?

49:59.079 --> 50:00.247
The one Aki sent.

50:00.330 --> 50:01.998
That Lauren,
the woman accusing my dad...

50:02.082 --> 50:04.960
was with her friends
that night at dinner,

50:05.043 --> 50:06.253
and her friends confirmed

50:06.336 --> 50:07.796
they dropped her off at home
alone.

50:07.879 --> 50:08.588
Okay, so then she couldn't have
been with your dad.

50:08.672 --> 50:11.508
Or she met up with him after?

50:11.591 --> 50:13.635
Yeah. But they also got
her phone records,

50:13.719 --> 50:15.846
which show that...

50:15.929 --> 50:17.681
there were multiple calls
to the same number.

50:17.764 --> 50:20.559
All under a minute,
so no answer.

50:20.642 --> 50:23.729
- Whose number was it?
- Riley, her boss at the time.

50:23.812 --> 50:25.772
Riley, like, Riley-Riley?

50:25.856 --> 50:28.191
Yeah.
My dad was producing for her.

50:28.275 --> 50:30.360
Okay, so then she called
her boss a bunch.

50:36.533 --> 50:38.744
There were two other calls
on the log

50:38.827 --> 50:39.953
to a different number.
Also no answer.

50:41.997 --> 50:43.457
To my dad's Blackberry.

50:43.540 --> 50:45.000
It's what he was using
at the time.

50:45.083 --> 50:46.460
Still not following.

50:46.543 --> 50:49.087
I hope I'm wrong,
but... I have a feeling

50:49.171 --> 50:52.048
that Riley was the one
with my dad that night.

50:52.132 --> 50:54.342
And for some reason,
Lauren's lying.

51:08.815 --> 51:09.983
- I'm gonna get a beer.

51:10.067 --> 51:13.028
No. Fuck the booze.
Where are the benzos, Aki?

51:13.111 --> 51:14.863
Uh, Helena's bathroom upstairs.

51:16.615 --> 51:17.032
Hi.
- Hi.

51:21.203 --> 51:23.163
Oh, my God.
How was, uh, dinner?

51:23.914 --> 51:24.039
Eventful.

51:25.749 --> 51:27.667
How was the concert?

51:27.751 --> 51:30.003
Julien disappeared,
so we did too.

51:30.086 --> 51:31.463
I don't know where she went.

51:31.546 --> 51:34.090
I've been calling her all night,
but she's not answering.

51:38.929 --> 51:41.723
Are you okay? You rolling?

51:41.807 --> 51:45.519
No.
No, I, uh... I'm happy.

51:46.603 --> 51:48.355
Max Wolfe's clothes are on,
and he's happy?

51:48.438 --> 51:50.899
- What has the world come to?

51:50.982 --> 51:54.110
Yeah.
Was the ballerina that good?

51:54.194 --> 51:56.988
Um... where's Obie?

51:57.072 --> 51:58.990
Uh, I don't know.
Somewhere in here.

Don't speak.

53:07.684 --> 53:09.477

November 8th, 2014, 8:54 a.m.,
Riley texts you,

53:23.199 --> 53:24.492
"What happened last night?"

53:24.576 --> 53:25.744
What is this about?

53:25.827 --> 53:28.872
8:55 a.m, you text back,
"What do you mean?"

53:28.955 --> 53:32.792
8:55 a.m., she texts back,
"I don't remember anything."

53:32.876 --> 53:35.337
You text back, "Are you serious?
We had fun."

53:35.420 --> 53:38.214
She texts back,
"Why don't I remember?"

53:39.049 --> 53:39.341
It's not what you think.

53:41.843 --> 53:44.596
I know that reading it that way

53:44.679 --> 53:46.932
could make you think
something crazy, but we...

53:51.144 --> 53:52.479
we spent the night together.

53:53.563 --> 53:55.315
That's it.

53:55.398 --> 53:57.192
She drank too much.
You know her.

53:57.275 --> 53:59.319
She always drank too much,
remember?

53:59.402 --> 54:01.488
- But you didn't.
- Of course not.

54:01.571 --> 54:03.198
You don't see anything wrong
about that?

54:03.281 --> 54:06.117
Riley isn't accusing me
of anything. Her manager is.

54:06.201 --> 54:08.495
This is just something
you've got inside of your head.

54:08.578 --> 54:13.249
- Are you gaslighting me?
- No! I-- I am your father.
