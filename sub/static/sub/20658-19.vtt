No, guys, the industry calls
them flushable wipes,

00:20.788 --> 00:22.890
but they're straight-up
not flushable.

00:22.923 --> 00:24.558
I mean, golf balls go down
the toilet too,

00:24.592 --> 00:26.727

call them flushable.

I know, there are, like,
so many systemic problems

00:56.624 --> 00:59.360
I wouldn't quite say your
problem is systemic.

01:05.799 --> 01:07.268
Adam, I'm happy to help.

01:07.301 --> 01:09.103
I can do it myself.

01:09.137 --> 01:10.404
Okay.

are you looking?

For a place
to live, yes, but--

01:53.381 --> 01:55.249
Come to think of it,
I probably shouldn't buy.

01:55.283 --> 01:56.517
And neither should you.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.852
Fact is, a lot of people
who shop for homes

01:58.886 --> 02:01.021
would actually be
better of renting.

02:01.054 --> 02:02.990

I just got a promotion,

02:03.023 --> 02:05.993

Yes, his name is Wolfram.

02:07.728 --> 02:10.264
Right, buying a house
is what you do.

02:10.298 --> 02:11.965
It's the American dream.

02:11.999 --> 02:14.802
Ah, yes, for almost a century,
Americans have been taught

02:14.835 --> 02:18.372
that homeownership is the
ultimate middle class ideal.

02:18.406 --> 02:22.276
Oh, Harold, our
very own little castle.

02:22.310 --> 02:23.511
Isn't it grand?

02:23.544 --> 02:25.613
Yes, freedom, stability,

02:25.646 --> 02:27.715
and no one will know
I'm a queer.
Oh!

02:27.748 --> 02:29.650
But the fact is
for millions of us,

02:29.683 --> 02:31.685
this is a dream
that's not worth chasing.

02:31.719 --> 02:34.522
Please, buying a home
gives you freedom.

02:34.555 --> 02:35.689
No, it doesn't.

02:35.723 --> 02:38.025
When you rent, you can
move whenever you want.

02:38.058 --> 02:40.794
But after you buy,
you're sorta stuck.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.296

Sorry, I'm just really
tied down right now.

02:50.438 --> 02:52.706
It's even been shown that higher
rates of homeownership

02:52.740 --> 02:56.544
lead to higher unemployment
for exactly this reason.

02:56.577 --> 02:59.079
You're forgetting that owning
a home makes financial sense.

02:59.112 --> 03:01.215
I am sick of paying
rent to some landlord.

03:01.249 --> 03:04.051
Yeah, instead you'll be paying
a mortgage to some bank.

03:04.084 --> 03:05.519
How is that any different?

03:05.553 --> 03:07.655
Well, let's see, I send you
a bill once a month.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.990
I kick you out
if you don't pay and,

03:10.023 --> 03:11.592
ah, I don't fix anything.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.894
That's the difference.

03:13.927 --> 03:15.729
You're gonna need this
when your heater explodes.

03:15.763 --> 03:16.930
And I'm gonna use your can

03:16.964 --> 03:19.367

for the next 30 years.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.601
(chuckling)

03:20.634 --> 03:24.104
Often, buying doesn't give you
any more stability than renting.

03:24.137 --> 03:26.073
You're just paying
a different jerk.

03:26.106 --> 03:28.342
And for the first few years,
you're not even building equity.

03:28.376 --> 03:29.910
You're just paying off interest.

Okay, hairball,

Licensed real estate agent.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.887
And I've been in the business
upwards of months.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.556
Buying a home is the best
investment you can make.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.758
Yes, so they say.

03:44.792 --> 03:47.027
Realtors and financial pundits
would have you believe

03:47.060 --> 03:49.397
that if you don't buy a home,
you're an idiot.

03:49.430 --> 03:52.966
Buy! Buy! Buy a home!

03:53.000 --> 03:55.369
No money?! Buy one anyway!

03:55.403 --> 03:58.772
If you don't buy a home,
that means you're a financial...

03:58.806 --> 04:01.642
(sound byte)
F-F-F-Failure!

04:01.675 --> 04:04.445
Oh, no, we gotta buy now,
the loud man said so!

04:04.478 --> 04:06.780
But what they don't tell you
is that buying a house

04:06.814 --> 04:09.617
can actually be
a really risky investment.

04:09.650 --> 04:10.584
Hey!

04:11.985 --> 04:13.621
Real financial experts recommend

04:13.654 --> 04:15.989
that you always diversify,

04:16.023 --> 04:17.057
splitting your money between

04:17.090 --> 04:18.492
lots of different investments,

04:18.526 --> 04:19.660
so if one of them goes south...

04:21.295 --> 04:22.996
You don't lose everything.

04:23.030 --> 04:25.999
But if you sink your
entire net worth

04:26.033 --> 04:28.736
into one pile
of wood and nails

04:28.769 --> 04:30.137
and the housing
market tanks...

04:30.170 --> 04:32.906
(match strikes)
...like it did in '08,

04:32.940 --> 04:35.142
you lose
everything.

04:35.175 --> 04:36.577
No-no-no-no...

04:36.610 --> 04:38.946
No-no-no-no, it's fine,
it's fine. (blowing)

04:38.979 --> 04:41.181
2008 was a blip.

04:41.214 --> 04:43.651
The housing market
always goes up on average.

04:43.684 --> 04:45.252
Yeah? That's what
everyone says.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.487
But it's not true.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.989
One of the world's foremost
housing economists found that

04:49.022 --> 04:51.492
when you adjust for inflation,
over the last century,

04:51.525 --> 04:55.095
the housing market
hasn't risen at all.

04:55.128 --> 04:58.198
Not to mention
the phantom costs.

04:58.231 --> 05:00.368
Did somebody say phantom?

05:00.401 --> 05:01.369
(gasping)

05:01.402 --> 05:02.603
A presence.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.171
A haunted house.

05:04.204 --> 05:06.139
How charming...
adds value.

05:06.173 --> 05:08.609
Phantom costs are the hidden
expenses of homeownership

05:08.642 --> 05:10.644
we ignore when
we rush to buy.

05:10.678 --> 05:12.513
You forgot about
home insurance.

05:12.546 --> 05:15.182
And property taxes,
closing costs...

05:15.215 --> 05:17.785
Repairs!

05:17.818 --> 05:19.820
This house doesn't
need any repairs.

05:19.853 --> 05:22.356
(cracking, loud crash)

05:22.390 --> 05:25.325
Recessed lighting
is much more popular now.

05:25.359 --> 05:27.227
In the first two years,
the average homeowner

05:27.260 --> 05:30.531
spends more than
14 grand on improvements.

05:30.564 --> 05:33.367
And that can more than wipe out
whatever little profit you make.

05:33.401 --> 05:36.036
I'm gonna use this money
to take girls out on dates.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.872
And then never reply
to their texts!

05:38.906 --> 05:41.341
Uh, do you have
any other properties?

05:43.076 --> 05:44.412
(woman sighing)
Adam's right.

05:44.445 --> 05:46.013
(gasping)
For a lot of people,

05:46.046 --> 05:47.047
buying a house is actually

05:47.080 --> 05:49.383
a risky low-yield investment

05:49.417 --> 05:51.485
that you have
to pay to maintain.

05:51.519 --> 05:53.320
Spirits are
everywhere.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.556
Oh, no, this is my friend
Ramit Sethi.

05:55.589 --> 05:57.024
He's a personal finance expert

05:57.057 --> 05:59.059
and a "New York Times"
best selling author.

05:59.092 --> 06:00.227
(Ramit)
You know, the truth is, guys,

06:00.260 --> 06:02.996
a lot of Americans actually
reduce their net worth

06:03.030 --> 06:05.165
instead of increasing it
when they buy a house.

06:05.198 --> 06:08.168
That's because they don't
factor in taxes, maintenance,

06:08.201 --> 06:10.438
insurance, even
repairing a roof.

06:10.471 --> 06:13.073
And that can put 'em behind
instead of ahead.

06:13.106 --> 06:15.242
So, what, we should
just keep renting?

06:15.275 --> 06:16.276
Maybe.

06:16.309 --> 06:17.778
Renting is actually
a much better deal

06:17.811 --> 06:18.946
than most people think.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.581
A lot of people
are gonna tell you,

06:20.614 --> 06:22.249
"You're throwing
money away on rent."

06:22.282 --> 06:23.250
Don't listen to 'em.

06:23.283 --> 06:24.685
Just think about it.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.087
The landlord has
to take on all the risk.

06:27.120 --> 06:30.023
If the price of the house goes
down, they're stuck with it.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.092
If something breaks,
they have to fix it.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.094
Meanwhile, you live
in that house.

06:34.127 --> 06:35.563
You pay a nominal rent.

06:35.596 --> 06:38.298
And if you need to pack up
and leave, you can do it.

06:38.331 --> 06:41.034
Huh, you're making it sound
like an incredible deal.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.537
Yeah, like, no one should
ever buy a house ever.

06:43.571 --> 06:46.239
No, look, buying a house can
make sense for some people.

06:46.273 --> 06:47.441
But just remember,

06:47.475 --> 06:50.478
this is the biggest financial
decision of your life.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.312
So, make sure
that you can afford it.

06:52.345 --> 06:54.114
Make sure that
you can put 20% down.

06:54.147 --> 06:57.384
And make sure you're gonna live
there for at least ten year.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.921
And please, talk to a financial
expert before you buy.

07:00.954 --> 07:03.156
Not a real estate agent.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.658
That makes sense.

07:04.692 --> 07:05.659
Maybe we should hold off.

07:05.693 --> 07:07.127
Mm-hmm.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.762
(gasping)
Ah, my face!

07:11.965 --> 07:13.166

07:13.200 --> 07:15.002
Go get a rental

07:15.035 --> 07:16.970
But I'm blacklisted by every
landlord in the city.

07:17.004 --> 07:19.406

Actually, it's Adam.

07:45.733 --> 07:46.700
There's the bathroom.

07:46.734 --> 07:48.836
I provide everything
except toilet paper.

07:48.869 --> 07:51.572
Before toilet paper, some
Americans used corn cobs.

07:54.241 --> 07:57.177
Okay, uh, over here,
I have a ton of DVDs.

07:57.210 --> 07:58.712
So, I hope you brought
your DVD player.

07:59.713 --> 08:01.114
This is the bedroom.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.616
I painted these.

08:02.650 --> 08:05.686
Yeah, this whole place is like
a gallery of my own art.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.487
Man, Airbnb rules.

08:07.521 --> 08:09.222
Yeah.
It sure does.

08:09.256 --> 08:11.559
Apart from the massive
legal liability, of course.

08:11.592 --> 08:12.860
Lia, what now?

08:12.893 --> 08:15.629
Well, Airbnb would have us
believe it's a hospitality

08:15.663 --> 08:18.198
utopia and better than
a hotel in every way.

08:18.231 --> 08:21.368
But the fact is, their business
model endangers guests,

08:21.401 --> 08:23.804
enables crooks and could leave
you on the hook

08:23.837 --> 08:25.639
for anything I do here.

08:25.673 --> 08:27.174
But I thought they
insured me or whatever.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.542
Not always.

08:28.576 --> 08:32.345
In many cases, Airbnb has
refused to pay for damages.

08:32.379 --> 08:35.348
One guest crammed a bunch of
stuff down the owner's toilet,

08:35.382 --> 08:37.985
causing $10,000 in damage.

08:39.086 --> 08:40.821

08:40.854 --> 08:43.924
But Airbnb only
offered to pay 78 bucks.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.058
Hey!

08:45.092 --> 08:46.193
I'm sorry.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.195
You know, I'm realizing this
is a pattern of behavior.

08:48.228 --> 08:51.498
In another case, a guest
refused to leave the property.

08:51.531 --> 08:54.034
And became a squatter.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.069
This is my house now!

08:56.103 --> 08:58.171
After Airbnb wouldn't help,

08:58.205 --> 09:02.075
the host was forced to hire an
expensive lawyer to evict them.

09:02.109 --> 09:03.243
I've been here so long

09:03.276 --> 09:06.413
that my skin fused
to your laundry basket.

09:06.446 --> 09:09.783
(laughing)

09:09.817 --> 09:12.620
But the risks guests
take is even worse.

09:12.653 --> 09:16.056
Hotels are required to undergo
routine safety inspections.

09:16.089 --> 09:19.359
But no one checks Airbnbs
for working sprinklers,

09:19.392 --> 09:20.393
fire alarms,

09:20.427 --> 09:21.428
(clicking)

09:21.461 --> 09:22.863
carbon monoxide detectors

09:22.896 --> 09:24.531
or fire exits.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.532
What the--

09:25.565 --> 09:26.967
I told you that's art.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.102
Airbnb will actually
send a photographer

09:29.136 --> 09:30.904
to take pictures
of your house...

09:30.938 --> 09:32.072
(grunts)

09:32.105 --> 09:34.608
But they don't send anyone
to make sure that it's safe.

09:34.642 --> 09:37.444
In 2013, at least
six Airbnb guests

09:37.477 --> 09:40.981
suffered carbon monoxide
poisoning, and one of them died.

09:41.014 --> 09:42.149
Oh.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.283
And we don't even know the total
number of people who have

09:43.316 --> 09:47.154
been hurt because Airbnb
refuses to release the numbers.

09:47.187 --> 09:49.256
Well, you take your chances
when you get a deal this good.

09:49.289 --> 09:52.425
Yeah, you do, but not everyone
gets the same deal.

09:52.459 --> 09:54.227
Airbnb let you
see my name and picture

09:54.261 --> 09:55.228
before you
approved me, right?

09:55.262 --> 09:56.429
They sure did.

09:56.463 --> 09:58.565
Well, Sears does
wonderful work.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.935
The problem is this
enables discrimination.

10:01.969 --> 10:04.137
One study found that guests
with black sounding names

10:04.171 --> 10:08.508
were 16% less likely to be
approved as Airbnb guests.

10:08.541 --> 10:10.443
Wait, was that
white family lying

10:10.477 --> 10:11.411
when they said I couldn't
stay with them?

10:11.444 --> 10:12.412
(gasping)

10:12.445 --> 10:13.981
Was there no emergency
yoga retreat?

10:14.014 --> 10:15.415
I'm afraid not.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.984
Nondiscrimination in hotels

10:17.017 --> 10:20.287
was something the civil rights
movement fought for for decades.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.822
That's why in
a traditional hotel,

10:21.855 --> 10:23.657
this kind of treatment
is illegal.

10:23.691 --> 10:26.493
But at Airbnb, the bad old days
are back again.

10:26.526 --> 10:27.828
That is so (bleep) up.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.196
Yeah, it is.

10:29.229 --> 10:30.197
And it doesn't end there.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.966
Because Airbnb is particularly
bad for cities.

10:34.702 --> 10:36.003
If landlords had their way,

10:36.036 --> 10:38.338
they would make every apartment
a vacation rental.

10:38.371 --> 10:39.539
Of course I would.

10:39.572 --> 10:42.209
Tourists pay a lot
more than tenants.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.777
But that
drives up my rent.

10:43.811 --> 10:46.013
I can't afford to live
in a dang hotel.

10:46.046 --> 10:48.481
(Adam)
So, to protect residents,
cities passed laws

10:48.515 --> 10:50.183
that limit vacation rentals
in apartment buildings.

10:50.217 --> 10:52.786
(siren blares)

10:52.820 --> 10:55.723
Problems is, Airbnb doesn't
respect those laws.

10:55.756 --> 10:59.827
A 2014 report found that nearly
three out of four Airbnb rentals

10:59.860 --> 11:01.962
in New York City were illegal.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.031
I'm not a criminal,
I'm an artist.

11:04.064 --> 11:05.966
Sure, you may be an artist,

11:05.999 --> 11:08.135
but a lot of Airbnb hosts
are con artists.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.669
Zane, this
is Roy Samaan.

11:09.703 --> 11:11.538
He researches housing
issues at LAANE,

11:11.571 --> 11:13.573
a Los Angeles based
advocacy group.

11:13.606 --> 11:15.142
Adam's right, Airbnb is used

11:15.175 --> 11:17.210
heavily by shady characters
who use the service

11:17.244 --> 11:19.046
to run illegal hotel chains.

11:20.580 --> 11:24.517
They take out multiple leases
in different buildings

11:24.551 --> 11:26.820
and Airbnb those
units year round.

11:26.854 --> 11:29.556
(man)
I just making little cash
when I'm out of town.

11:29.589 --> 11:31.859
(Adam)
These jerks take critical
residential housing

11:31.892 --> 11:34.895
out of the market which drives
up rent for all of us.

11:34.928 --> 11:37.330
And Airbnb does
nothing to stop 'em.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.099
There was even a case in L.A.
where a landlord

11:39.132 --> 11:41.034
evicted an entire
apartment building

11:41.068 --> 11:43.370
so he could rent out the rooms
on Airbnb.

11:43.403 --> 11:46.573
Left unregulated, Airbnb can
destroy entire neighborhoods.

11:46.606 --> 11:47.574
I don't know, bro.

11:47.607 --> 11:50.077
Is it on Airbnb to control
what their users do?

11:50.110 --> 11:51.578
Airbnb is a big tech company

11:51.611 --> 11:54.014
and they can filter out illegal
listings very easily.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.449
Instead, they're putting the
burden on us and on cities

11:56.483 --> 11:58.718
to go one by one and sue these
landlords to make sure

11:58.752 --> 12:01.421
they're not breaking the law,
and that just isn't fair.

12:01.454 --> 12:02.422
Thanks, Roy.

12:02.455 --> 12:03.523
Hey, Adam, can I come in?

12:03.556 --> 12:04.792
My arms are getting
really tired.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.927
Oh, it's not actually
my place, so...

12:06.960 --> 12:08.295
I don't know you, bro.

12:08.328 --> 12:09.797
(window closes, Roy screams)

12:09.830 --> 12:12.099
Not only does Airbnb
know about these crooks,

12:12.132 --> 12:13.901
they actually take a cut.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.635
I can't believe we let
them get away with this.

12:15.668 --> 12:17.938
If three out of four Craigslist
users were using the site

12:17.971 --> 12:19.572
to commit murder,
we'd be, like,

12:19.606 --> 12:21.374
"Somebody stop
that murder website?!

12:21.408 --> 12:23.944
I want them killed
with a knife, oh,

12:23.977 --> 12:28.615
from behind
for under $100 a stab.

12:28.648 --> 12:32.285
Not only does Airbnb profit
from illegal activity,

12:32.319 --> 12:34.221
they've even secretly
purged the records

12:34.254 --> 12:36.156
of illegal listings
from data they've released

12:36.189 --> 12:38.625
to make it look like
it's not happening.

12:38.658 --> 12:39.960
Wow.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.228
That's not icy.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.295
That's straight-up dicey.

12:42.329 --> 12:44.397
It's a shame because
Airbnb actually provides

12:44.431 --> 12:45.465
a valuable service.

12:45.498 --> 12:47.901
Like, in remote areas
that don't have hotels.

12:47.935 --> 12:50.070
But they also need
to be a good neighbor.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.671
And right now,
they're doing the opposite.

12:51.704 --> 12:52.806
Damn.

12:52.840 --> 12:53.841
Thanks, Alan.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.976
It's Adam, and no problem.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.244
I can rest easy tonight

12:57.277 --> 12:59.346
knowing I've taught
one person the truth.

12:59.379 --> 13:00.747
You're not staying here.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.682
I cancelled the reservation
five minutes ago.

13:02.715 --> 13:04.651
You blew up my toilet, remember?

13:04.684 --> 13:06.353
But where will I stay now?!

13:06.386 --> 13:08.021
I don't know, man,
sleep on the street.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.825
Well, everything we know
about homelessness is wrong.

13:11.859 --> 13:13.360
I can talk about that.

13:13.393 --> 13:14.794
Yeah, this'll be great.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.569
Oh!

13:24.404 --> 13:25.772
Hey, there, buddy.

13:25.805 --> 13:26.773
I'm with Good Peeps.

13:26.806 --> 13:27.975
Do you need assistance?

13:28.008 --> 13:29.509
Oh, I'm not homeless.

13:29.542 --> 13:32.012
Oh, where do you live?

13:32.045 --> 13:33.881
Well, I was kicked out
of my apartment.

13:33.914 --> 13:35.715
Then I was kicked
out of a haunted house.

13:35.748 --> 13:38.385
And then I blew up a guy's
toilet in an Airbnb.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.153
Sounds like
a tough couple years.

13:40.187 --> 13:41.788
No, that was all today.

13:41.821 --> 13:45.125
Trouble integrating
into society.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.360
It's common among
the homeless.

13:47.394 --> 13:50.397
Let me show you the wonderful
services we provide.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.065
♪♪

13:52.099 --> 13:54.234
At Good Peeps we provide
hot meals,

13:54.267 --> 13:57.204
substance abuse
counseling and job training.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.739
Our mission here
is to end homelessness.

13:59.772 --> 14:01.008
Wow.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.010
None of those things
will accomplish that.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.012
In fact, this
old-fashioned approach

14:05.045 --> 14:06.914
does nothing to end
homelessness.

14:06.947 --> 14:09.917
What? I've been volunteering
here upwards of months.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.084
I know what I'm doing.

14:11.118 --> 14:12.319
We're feeding the homeless.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.587
Yes, and that
is very generous.

14:14.621 --> 14:17.891
But it doesn't change the fact
that they don't have homes.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.759
Can't build a house
out of soup.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.261
I'll take it.

14:21.294 --> 14:22.996
Okay, fair point.

14:23.030 --> 14:24.531
But we're doing
our best to help.

14:24.564 --> 14:27.167
I mean, substance abuse
is a real problem.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.937
That's why we require our
clients to get sober

14:29.970 --> 14:31.438
before we help
them with housing.

14:31.471 --> 14:32.839
Why would someone
need to be sober

14:32.872 --> 14:35.108
before they can have
a place to live?

14:35.142 --> 14:37.444
'Cause they might
smoke the house?

14:37.477 --> 14:39.179
Addiction is a disease, man.

14:39.212 --> 14:42.215
Can you imagine refusing someone
housing for any other disease?

14:42.249 --> 14:44.284
Rejected?
Why?

14:44.317 --> 14:46.286
Sorry, Harry,
you know the rules.

14:46.319 --> 14:47.921
One diabetic coma
and you're out.

14:47.955 --> 14:49.356
Call us when you're
off the insulin.

14:49.389 --> 14:52.125
Research shows programs
that require abstinence

14:52.159 --> 14:53.927
place such a burden
on the homeless

14:53.961 --> 14:56.763
that many drop out and return
to living on the streets.

14:56.796 --> 14:59.466
Well, what about
job training?

14:59.499 --> 15:02.135
We give them skill so they can
get a job and afford a home.

15:02.169 --> 15:04.637
Even if you're trained,
think about how hard it is

15:04.671 --> 15:07.407
to get a job if you don't
have a place to live.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.977
So, under address you wrote,

15:10.010 --> 15:13.080
Zero don't have
a mailbox boulevard?

15:13.113 --> 15:16.483
Yeah, but don't
send my checks there.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.986
We'll be in touch.

15:19.019 --> 15:21.989
The services you're providing
are well-intentioned and kind.

15:22.022 --> 15:24.324
But they're doing nothing
to solve the real problem.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.226
These people still
don't have homes.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.995
You're right.

15:28.028 --> 15:29.262
It's hopeless.

15:29.296 --> 15:31.764
I mean, deep down, I knew it,
no matter what we do,

15:31.798 --> 15:34.001
the rate of homelessness
never goes down.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.768
There's no way
to fix this.

15:35.802 --> 15:37.670
Oh, no, actually there is.

15:37.704 --> 15:40.107
A miraculously simple one,
and it's being used

15:40.140 --> 15:42.442
to great effect all
across the country.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.611
Really?
Tell me what it is, please.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.279
Just give them homes.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.348
Shut the front door.

15:48.381 --> 15:49.983
I would if I could.

15:51.018 --> 15:53.320
You can't just
give people homes.

15:53.353 --> 15:56.356
(man)
Actually, yeah, you can.

15:56.389 --> 15:58.591
Oh, this is Rudy Salinas.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.960
He's the program director
at Housing Works L.A.

16:00.994 --> 16:02.262
Hey, Rudy.
Hello, Adam.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.364
Would you mind telling Connor
what Housing First is all about?

16:04.397 --> 16:06.366
Sure, with Housing First
we prioritize putting

16:06.399 --> 16:08.435
people who experience
chronic homelessness

16:08.468 --> 16:10.003
in their own
permanent housing.

16:10.037 --> 16:11.471
Once we put a person
into an apartment,

16:11.504 --> 16:13.440
we're able to address
all the issues and causes

16:13.473 --> 16:15.142
of why they become homeless
in the first place.

16:15.175 --> 16:16.643
Studies have shown
that when you put a person

16:16.676 --> 16:19.212
in their own permanent housing,
their health improves

16:19.246 --> 16:21.881
significantly and you're able to
affect change in their lives.

16:21.914 --> 16:23.816
Not to mention,
once they have a home,

16:23.850 --> 16:26.386
they're no longer,
you know, homeless.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.721
Huh, it was right there
in the word all along.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.657
This is the new method being
used across the country

16:30.690 --> 16:31.791
to address homelessness,

16:31.824 --> 16:33.560
and it's been proven
to have great results.

16:33.593 --> 16:36.363
In Utah, Housing First cut the
number of chronically homeless

16:36.396 --> 16:39.666
by 90% in just ten years.

16:39.699 --> 16:42.202
But giving all those homes away
must've cost a fortune.

16:42.235 --> 16:45.072
Nope, it actually
saved money.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.240
When people live on the street,
our taxes have to pay

16:47.274 --> 16:48.708
for their emergency services,

16:48.741 --> 16:50.577
law enforcement
and hospital visits.

16:50.610 --> 16:51.878
(groans)

16:51.911 --> 16:54.347
In Utah, the average yearly cost
per homeless person

16:54.381 --> 16:56.683
was over $19,000.

16:56.716 --> 16:59.252
But the cost of giving someone
a home and a counselor

16:59.286 --> 17:01.588
was just $7800.

17:01.621 --> 17:05.658
That means Utah actually
saved over $11,000

17:05.692 --> 17:08.027
for every person
they gave a home to.

17:08.061 --> 17:11.431
Okay, but, I, I feel selfish
for saying this but...

17:11.464 --> 17:13.200
I paid for my home.

17:13.233 --> 17:16.169
It doesn't seem fair that
they should get one for free.

17:16.203 --> 17:17.937
Well, I know it's
counterintuitive,

17:17.970 --> 17:19.172
but let me put it this way.

17:19.206 --> 17:20.607
You can either
let a person in need

17:20.640 --> 17:22.709
sleep on the street
and waste money

17:22.742 --> 17:25.678
or give them
a home and save money.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.347
I know which I'd choose.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.416
Connor, I want you
to meet someone.

17:29.449 --> 17:30.550
Hey, Rudy.
Hey, Dorothy.

17:30.583 --> 17:31.551
This is Dorothy Edwards.

17:31.584 --> 17:32.785
She's my co-worker.

17:32.819 --> 17:33.620
Hi, nice to meet you.
(Conner)
Nice to meet you.

17:33.653 --> 17:34.687
And she used to be homeless.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.889
Yeah, I was homeless
for 15 years,

17:36.923 --> 17:40.026
and I had no future,
I had no hope.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.261
I was addicted to drugs,

17:41.294 --> 17:43.530
living in a tent
on the side of the freeway.

17:43.563 --> 17:46.566
Um, I was dying on the streets,
literally dying.

17:46.599 --> 17:50.036
And then one day I was
approached by Housing Works.

17:50.069 --> 17:53.140
And they said, you know,
there's this Housing First model

17:53.173 --> 17:55.542
that's new and we'd like
you to be a part of it.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.245
And they got me this great home
that I live in today.

17:58.278 --> 17:59.912
Look at this place.

17:59.946 --> 18:03.049
Now I've grown so much living
there in the last four years.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.651
It changed everything.

18:04.684 --> 18:06.753
I'm off of drugs
clean and sober.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.821
I became a homeless
advocate myself.

18:08.855 --> 18:13.226
I speak on national and state
levels for policy change.

18:13.260 --> 18:16.062
That's amazing.
I wanna help too.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.497
Is there something
I can do to be involved?

18:17.530 --> 18:19.466
Sure, there are
organizations practicing

18:19.499 --> 18:20.833
Housing First nationwide.

18:20.867 --> 18:23.170
You may wanna contact your local
homeless service provider.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.905
Actually I'm going to a move-in
party right now where we

18:25.938 --> 18:28.975
put together everything a new
tenant needs for their place.

18:29.008 --> 18:30.943
Ooh, that sounds great,
can I come?

18:30.977 --> 18:32.512
Absolutely.

18:32.545 --> 18:33.980
See you later, Rudy.

18:34.013 --> 18:36.916
Hey, uh, Rudy, what would
you do if theoretically

18:36.949 --> 18:39.018
you didn't have
a place to stay tonight?

18:39.051 --> 18:42.455
Well, I'd ask myself who can
I turn to who can help me out?

18:42.489 --> 18:43.523
Hmm.

19:50.056 --> 19:51.491
Yeah.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.425
Over half a million people

19:52.459 --> 19:54.361
in the U.S. are homeless.

19:54.394 --> 19:55.528
Homeowners are struggling

19:55.562 --> 19:56.529
to pay their mortgages.

19:56.563 --> 19:58.231
And nearly half of all renters

19:58.265 --> 19:59.999
are spending 30% of their income

20:00.032 --> 20:01.834
on rent.

20:01.868 --> 20:04.704
That's unprecedented.

20:04.737 --> 20:05.905
Yup.

20:05.938 --> 20:09.342
So, we need to eliminate our
infatuation with homeownership

20:09.376 --> 20:10.677
and build low-cost rentals.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.512

20:16.616 --> 20:19.051
And provide the chronically
homeless with places to live.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.022
And if we do all those things

20:23.055 --> 20:25.024
we'll be that much closer
to providing everyone
