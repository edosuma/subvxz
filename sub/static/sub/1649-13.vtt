00:03.171 --> 00:05.162
(wind blowing)

00:15.224 --> 00:17.215
(walkers growling )

00:23.941 --> 00:25.932
( helicopter approaching )

00:34.577 --> 00:36.568
(growling)

01:43.187 --> 01:45.223
(fence creaking )

02:33.821 --> 02:35.857
(gunshot)

02:58.304 --> 03:00.920
(theme music playing )

03:35.925 --> 03:37.381
I'm going after them.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.052
Lori: Don't.
They could be anywhere.

03:39.220 --> 03:41.711
And if Randall comes back,
we're gonna need you here.

03:44.392 --> 03:46.348
- Rick and Shane ain't back?
-Loﬁ:No.

03:46.519 --> 03:48.760
- We heard a shot.
- Maybe they found Randall.

03:48.938 --> 03:50.929
- Daryl: We found him.
- Maggie: Is he back in the shed?

03:51.107 --> 03:52.563
He's a walker.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.065
Did you find the walker
that bit him?

03:55.236 --> 03:57.192
No, the weird thing is
he wasn't bit.

03:57.363 --> 03:59.729
- Daryl: His neck was broke.
- Patricia: So he fought back.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.693
Daryl: The thing is,
Shane and Randall's tracks

04:01.867 --> 04:03.528
were right
on top of each other.

04:03.702 --> 04:05.317
And Shane ain't
no tracker,

04:05.496 --> 04:08.738
so he didn't come up behind him.
They were together.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.497
Would you please get back
out there and find Rick and Shane

04:10.668 --> 04:12.124
and find out
what on earth is going on?

04:12.294 --> 04:13.795
- You got it.
- Thank you.

04:13.963 --> 04:15.999
( crickets chirping )

04:18.008 --> 04:19.669
You bit, too?

04:22.304 --> 04:23.965
No.

04:25.808 --> 04:27.673
Shane was.

04:29.562 --> 04:32.645
That wasn't Shane.
You know that.

04:34.567 --> 04:36.478
Used to be.

04:40.948 --> 04:43.610
What happened?

04:45.619 --> 04:47.575
You guys attacked?

04:48.622 --> 04:50.704
I mean, |--
I heard a gunshot,

04:50.875 --> 04:53.958
but I didn't see
any walkers nearby.

04:58.299 --> 05:00.335
How did Shane die?

05:10.811 --> 05:13.598
(walkers growling )

05:15.357 --> 05:19.020
Oh, my God. Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go.

05:24.825 --> 05:27.111
(walkers growling )

05:36.504 --> 05:38.790
We got to get to the house,
tell the others.

05:38.964 --> 05:40.670
We'll never get through that.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.456
Can't go around.

05:42.635 --> 05:45.001
Carl, stay close. Go!

05:45.179 --> 05:47.135
( hisses )

05:49.517 --> 05:52.429
- Patricia, kill the lights.
- I'll get the guns.

05:52.603 --> 05:54.184
Maybe they'll just pass,
like the herd on the highway.

05:54.355 --> 05:55.344
Should we just go inside?

05:55.523 --> 05:57.388
Not unless there's a tunnel
downstairs I don't know about.

05:57.566 --> 05:59.557
A herd that size will
rip the house down.

06:04.365 --> 06:06.401
(banging)

06:13.123 --> 06:15.250
(wood creaking )

06:19.421 --> 06:21.036
- Carl's gone.
- What?

06:21.215 --> 06:23.046
He-- he was upstairs.
I can't find him anymore.

06:23.217 --> 06:25.253
- Glenn: Maybe he's hiding.
- He's supposed to be upstairs.

06:25.427 --> 06:27.213
- I'm not leaving without my boy.
- Carol: We're not.

06:27.388 --> 06:28.844
We're gonna look again.
We're gonna find him.

06:29.014 --> 06:30.265
So many.

06:30.432 --> 06:32.468
(banging, growling)

06:47.449 --> 06:48.575
Maggie.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.448
You grow up country,
you pick up a thing or two.

06:50.619 --> 06:52.280
They got the numbers.
It's no use.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.319
You can go if you want.

06:54.498 --> 06:56.830
- ( gun cocks)
- You gonna take 'em all on?

06:57.001 --> 07:00.243
We have guns.
We have cars.

07:00.421 --> 07:02.286
Kill as many as we can,

07:02.464 --> 07:05.627
then we use the cars to lead
the rest of them off the farm.

07:05.801 --> 07:09.134
- Are you serious?
- This is my farm.

07:09.305 --> 07:11.045
l'll die here.

07:11.223 --> 07:13.760
All right. It's as good
a night as any.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.096
All right, here we go.
Get behind me.

07:17.271 --> 07:19.637
Come on.
Hurry.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.224
Rick: Oh, shit.
All right. Okay.

07:23.402 --> 07:25.233
Up there. Hurry.

07:25.404 --> 07:27.611
- What about you?
- I'll be right there.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.612
Drop the lighter
when I say.

07:31.243 --> 07:33.108
We'll stop some of them
from reaching the house

07:33.287 --> 07:35.494
and distract the others,
so at least we'll have a chance.

07:35.664 --> 07:38.997
Hey, hey, hey, look at me.
You can do this.

07:40.085 --> 07:41.245
Carl...

07:41.420 --> 07:42.785
I love you.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.956
All right, go, go, go.

07:49.637 --> 07:52.128
(shouting )
Hey! Hey!

07:53.140 --> 07:54.505
You want some?!

07:55.517 --> 07:57.473
Come and get it!

07:57.645 --> 07:59.886
Come on!
Come on!

08:01.148 --> 08:02.649
Come on!

08:03.651 --> 08:04.982
Over here!

08:05.152 --> 08:07.643
Come on!
You want some of this?

08:10.282 --> 08:12.193
Carl, now!

08:25.005 --> 08:26.996
( motorcycle rewing )

08:39.520 --> 08:42.512
( gunshots)

08:50.698 --> 08:52.984
- Keep it steady!
- I'm trying!

08:53.158 --> 08:55.535
- ( shotgun firing)
- Damn it.

08:58.455 --> 09:00.161
Shit!

09:14.555 --> 09:16.887
(moaning)

09:23.564 --> 09:26.556
(gunshots continue)

09:28.694 --> 09:30.434
They're headed for it.

09:30.612 --> 09:32.398
Maybe Rick set it
to draw 'em in.

09:32.573 --> 09:34.404
I can't find him anywhere.

09:34.575 --> 09:36.941
- So maybe he snuck outside.
- What do I do?!

09:37.119 --> 09:39.451
He was here.
He must've run off,

09:39.621 --> 09:41.577
maybe looking for Rick
or went after Randall himself.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.614
Patricia:
Maybe he set the fire.

10:02.561 --> 10:05.428
Yo! Must've been Rick or Shane
who started that fire.

10:05.606 --> 10:08.018
Maybe they're trying to get out back.
Why don't you circle around?

10:08.192 --> 10:10.103
- Got it!
- Go!

10:17.075 --> 10:19.612
Hey! Here!

10:19.787 --> 10:21.243
Get in here!

10:21.413 --> 10:24.530
Put it right there!
Come on!

10:32.966 --> 10:34.627
Go on, go on.

10:38.472 --> 10:40.713
Oh, no.
No!

10:40.891 --> 10:42.882
(screaming )
Oh, no!

10:43.060 --> 10:45.597
Oh, God!
Oh, God!

10:56.281 --> 10:57.987
Come on! Now!

11:01.620 --> 11:03.360
All right, go.

11:05.457 --> 11:07.789
(Jimmy screaming)

11:09.795 --> 11:11.660
Rick:
This way.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.441
Andrea: They're all over the place.
There's no corralling them.

11:42.619 --> 11:44.735
We're gonna run out of ammo
before we even make a dent.

11:44.913 --> 11:46.619
We need
a new game plan.

11:53.797 --> 11:55.503
There.
Head for the woods now,

11:55.674 --> 11:57.710
as fast as you can.
Come on.

12:11.106 --> 12:12.642
Hershel:
Come on!

12:12.816 --> 12:14.647
I checked the shed.
I can't find him anywhere.

12:14.818 --> 12:17.605
- He's not in the cellar or the attic.
- Why can't he listen for once?

12:17.779 --> 12:20.816
Okay, okay, if he followed
his daddy, he went that way.

12:20.991 --> 12:23.482
No, you'll lead 'em right to him.
We can't stay here!

12:23.660 --> 12:26.072
- But that's my boy!
- You're gonna have to trust.

12:26.246 --> 12:29.033
If we find him, he's gonna need
his mother. We've got to go.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.663
Get the others.

12:33.837 --> 12:36.328
(shouting )
Carl!

12:36.506 --> 12:39.634
Carol: Beth, Patricia, come on.
We've got to go now.

12:44.765 --> 12:46.096
Carol: Lori.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.471
- Hershel.
- Come on!

12:50.646 --> 12:52.762
Hershel.
Hershel!

12:54.399 --> 12:57.106
- Hershel, it's time to go!
- Come on! Now!

12:58.820 --> 13:01.527
Hershel!
Hershel!

13:04.159 --> 13:06.491
- Go.
- Come on.

13:06.662 --> 13:09.074
- We gotta go.
- Lori: Stay behind me.

13:09.247 --> 13:10.953
Stay behind me.

13:12.084 --> 13:14.040
Come on, girls.
Come on.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.043
- ( growls )
- ( screams )

13:17.214 --> 13:19.671
- No!
- ( flesh tearing )

13:33.563 --> 13:35.975
(screaming )

13:41.488 --> 13:43.319
(whimpering)

13:45.534 --> 13:48.196
Dad! Dad!

13:48.370 --> 13:50.156
- Get in!
- Get Carol.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.490
She ran that way.

13:51.665 --> 13:53.621
T-Dog: Get in!

13:55.502 --> 13:57.834
( gunshots)

14:00.215 --> 14:01.455
Look out!

14:03.593 --> 14:05.424
- They got her!
- Andrea!

14:05.595 --> 14:06.971
We've got to go!

14:07.139 --> 14:08.879
Lori:
Dog, come on!

14:09.057 --> 14:11.093
(engine revs)

14:22.654 --> 14:24.030
Maggie:
Where the hell are they going?

14:24.197 --> 14:25.653
Should I follow them?

14:25.824 --> 14:27.360
I'd say yes.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.035
Swing it around.
Swing it around here.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.487
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:30.662 --> 14:32.277
Oh, my God.

14:32.456 --> 14:35.869
- ( growling )
- I can't get through.

14:38.086 --> 14:39.542
- Head out.
- What?

14:39.713 --> 14:41.920
- Get off the farm now.
- Don't say that.

14:42.090 --> 14:44.832
- Maggie, it's lost!
- The others-- we can't leave them.

14:46.595 --> 14:48.210
( screams )

14:51.349 --> 14:54.056
Get off the farm now!

15:05.072 --> 15:06.653
Come on!

15:07.991 --> 15:09.697
Come on!

15:23.507 --> 15:25.043
- ( growls)
- ( gunshot)

15:25.217 --> 15:27.549
Come on!

15:27.719 --> 15:29.505
Where's Lori?
Did you see Lori?

15:29.679 --> 15:31.465
I don't know what happened, Rick.
They just keep coming.

15:31.640 --> 15:32.880
It's like a plague.
They're everywhere.

15:33.058 --> 15:34.047
Lori! Did you see her?

15:34.226 --> 15:35.807
- No!
- We have to go.

15:35.977 --> 15:37.387
Find Mom and the others.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.186
- It's my farm!
- Not anymore!

15:40.357 --> 15:43.565
- Come on!
- Come on! Come on!

15:47.864 --> 15:49.980
- Come on!
- Hershel!

15:50.158 --> 15:51.898
Come on!

15:53.120 --> 15:55.452
- ( engine starts)
- Go.

15:57.958 --> 16:00.916
Rick! Rick, wait!
Wait!

16:20.355 --> 16:22.596
( Carol screams )

16:22.774 --> 16:24.810
(engine rewing)

16:32.409 --> 16:34.445
( panting )

16:40.167 --> 16:42.283
Daryl:
Come on, I ain't got all day!

16:46.840 --> 16:48.501
Go!

17:20.040 --> 17:22.076
(walkers growling )

18:28.441 --> 18:30.477
(walkers growling )

18:44.749 --> 18:47.786
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

18:47.961 --> 18:50.373
All right, let's just-- let's just
circle back to the highway.

18:50.547 --> 18:53.038
Did you see my dad?
Did-- did he make it?

18:53.216 --> 18:55.582
- Did you see?
- I couldn't see anything.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.090
And Beth-- I lost Beth.
We've gotta go back there.

18:59.264 --> 19:00.925
We can't go back, okay?
There's nothing to go back to.

19:01.099 --> 19:03.135
But Beth--

19:03.310 --> 19:05.221
|-|-- I think
she was with Lori.

19:05.395 --> 19:08.262
- Did they make it?
- I don't know.

19:08.440 --> 19:11.398
Patricia? Jimmy?

19:13.278 --> 19:15.360
What if they didn't make it?
What if nobody made it?

19:15.530 --> 19:16.940
They made it, okay?

19:17.115 --> 19:18.446
They had to.

19:18.616 --> 19:20.481
All right, let's just

19:20.660 --> 19:22.742
circle around to the highway where
we left supplies for Sophia.

19:22.912 --> 19:25.870
(crying ) No, the herd came
from that direction.

19:30.628 --> 19:32.880
Just stop.
Stop the car.

19:33.048 --> 19:36.211
- Stop the car.
- ( sniffles )

19:37.218 --> 19:39.004
Let me drive.

19:53.234 --> 19:55.065
(sobbing )

19:55.236 --> 19:57.192
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

19:57.364 --> 20:00.276
Hey, Maggie, look at me.
Look at me.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.525
Hey, we're alive.
We made it.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.194
Okay?
I'm sure they are, too.

20:08.083 --> 20:10.119
Right?

20:12.128 --> 20:13.789
I love you.

20:14.798 --> 20:16.663
Maggie, I love you.

20:18.343 --> 20:19.958
lshould've said it
a long time ago

20:20.136 --> 20:22.047
and it's been true
for a long time.

20:26.267 --> 20:29.680
We're gonna be
all right, okay?

20:31.189 --> 20:32.725
We'll be all right.

20:32.899 --> 20:35.231
Okay. Yeah.

21:02.220 --> 21:03.926
Wait, where's Mom?

21:04.097 --> 21:06.133
You said she'd be here.

21:07.684 --> 21:09.640
We've got to go back for her.

21:09.811 --> 21:11.676
- Carl--
- No. Why are we running?

21:11.855 --> 21:13.140
What are you doing?

21:13.314 --> 21:14.975
lt's-- it is Mom.

21:15.150 --> 21:17.311
We need to get her
and not be safe a mile away.

21:17.485 --> 21:20.602
Shh. We need to be quiet,
all right? Please.

21:24.951 --> 21:27.067
Please...

21:28.246 --> 21:29.861
it's Mom.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.995
- Look, Carl, listen--
- No.

21:40.717 --> 21:42.503
Rick.

21:46.514 --> 21:49.551
You've got to get
your boy to safety.

21:49.726 --> 21:52.934
I'll wait here for my girls
and the others.

21:53.104 --> 21:55.561
I know a few places.

21:55.732 --> 21:57.097
We'll meet up
at one of them later.

21:57.275 --> 21:59.311
Where?
Where is safe?

22:01.446 --> 22:03.402
We're not splitting up.

22:03.573 --> 22:05.734
Please,

22:05.909 --> 22:07.865
keep your boy safe.

22:08.036 --> 22:09.776
|'|| hide
in one of the cars.

22:09.954 --> 22:12.070
If a walker gets me,
so be it.

22:12.248 --> 22:13.749
I've lost my farm.

22:13.917 --> 22:16.454
I've lost my wife
and maybe my daughters.

22:16.628 --> 22:18.493
You don't know that.

22:19.589 --> 22:21.204
They'll be here.

22:21.382 --> 22:24.374
- And you don't know that.
- You're a man of God.

22:24.552 --> 22:26.383
Have some faith.

22:26.554 --> 22:28.385
I can't profess

22:28.556 --> 22:31.468
to understand God's plan,

22:31.643 --> 22:35.386
but Christ promised
the resurrection of the dead.

22:37.273 --> 22:39.935
ljust thought
he had something

22:40.109 --> 22:42.816
a little different in mind.

22:47.325 --> 22:49.441
We stick together.

22:57.627 --> 23:00.118
Hey, we've got to turn around.

23:00.296 --> 23:02.036
Straight back
to that herd?

23:02.215 --> 23:03.876
Um, no.

23:04.050 --> 23:05.961
The highway's back there.
That's where they'll be.

23:06.135 --> 23:07.671
Rick will go back
to where we first broke down.

23:07.845 --> 23:09.631
- And Glenn, too.
- We're headed east.

23:09.806 --> 23:11.888
Get to the coast. We should've
done that from the jump.

23:12.058 --> 23:14.845
Look, we've got a shot to get out
of here in one piece.

23:15.019 --> 23:16.975
I've got to find Carl.
He may have escaped with somebody.

23:17.146 --> 23:18.932
I hate to say it,
but they're on their own.

23:19.107 --> 23:21.268
There's no way to even
begin to start looking.

23:21.442 --> 23:23.103
Lori:
You're wrong.

23:23.278 --> 23:25.234
Look, we can't go back.

23:25.405 --> 23:27.020
I'm sorry.
lt's suicide.

23:27.198 --> 23:29.405
All right,
then let me out.

23:29.576 --> 23:31.783
- Hey! Whoa!
- ( tires screeching )

23:33.204 --> 23:35.911
You turn around,
or you let us out right now.

23:36.082 --> 23:39.370
I should do it, you know.
Hey!

23:39.544 --> 23:41.660
- ( sighs )
- T-Dog.

23:43.381 --> 23:45.713
You're out
of your damn minds.

23:58.479 --> 24:00.515
(growling)

24:04.694 --> 24:06.685
(whispers ) Okay.
Come, come, come, come.

24:17.999 --> 24:20.832
I don't know how
much longer we can stay here.

24:22.629 --> 24:24.870
I'm not leaving
without Mom.

24:25.048 --> 24:27.414
So we're just
gonna walk away?

24:27.592 --> 24:29.628
Not knowing if my wife,

24:29.802 --> 24:32.134
your girls are still out there?
How do we live with that?

24:32.305 --> 24:35.889
You've only got one
concern now-- just one--

24:36.059 --> 24:38.141
keeping him alive.

24:38.311 --> 24:40.222
Nature may be
throwing us a curveball,

24:40.396 --> 24:43.354
but that law is still true.

24:55.495 --> 24:56.905
Carl.

24:59.916 --> 25:01.827
It's not safe here.

25:04.712 --> 25:07.419
I'm sorry.

25:07.590 --> 25:09.455
- We'll--
- ( motorcycle approaching )

25:53.386 --> 25:56.549
Oh, thank God!
( laughs)

26:06.566 --> 26:08.477
Where'd you find everyone?

26:08.651 --> 26:11.393
Well, this guys' tail lights
zigzagging all over the road--

26:11.571 --> 26:14.233
figured he had to be Asian,
driving like that.

26:14.407 --> 26:16.238
( chuckles )
Good one.

26:18.035 --> 26:20.822
We're the only ones
who made it so far.

26:20.997 --> 26:22.578
Shane?

26:30.423 --> 26:32.254
Andrea?

26:32.425 --> 26:35.588
- She saved me, then I lost her.
- We saw her go down.

26:36.596 --> 26:38.086
Hershel: Patricia?

26:40.349 --> 26:42.556
They got her, too.

26:42.727 --> 26:44.934
Took her right from me.
l was--

26:45.104 --> 26:48.267
l was holdin' onto her,
Daddy. She just--

26:48.441 --> 26:51.023
(crying)

26:51.194 --> 26:53.560
What about Jimmy?
Did you see Jimmy?

26:53.738 --> 26:56.946
He was in the RV.
It got overrun.

26:58.993 --> 27:01.109
You definitely saw Andrea?

27:01.287 --> 27:03.198
There were
walkers everywhere.

27:03.372 --> 27:05.408
Carol:
Did you see her?

27:06.876 --> 27:08.787
- Daryl: I'm gonna go back.
- Rick: No.

27:08.961 --> 27:11.338
- We can't just leave her.
- We don't even know if she's there.

27:11.506 --> 27:12.962
She isn't there.
She isn't.

27:13.132 --> 27:15.339
She's somewhere else
or she's dead.

27:15.510 --> 27:17.842
- There's no way to find her.
- So we're not even gonna look for her?

27:18.012 --> 27:19.468
Rick:
We've got to keep moving.

27:19.639 --> 27:21.504
There have been walkers
crawling all over here.

27:21.682 --> 27:25.049
- I say head east.
- Stay off the main roads.

27:25.228 --> 27:27.093
The bigger the road,
the more walkers,

27:27.271 --> 27:30.559
more assholes like this one.
I got him.

27:33.861 --> 27:35.476
(engine starts)

28:06.519 --> 28:09.261
( panting )

28:12.275 --> 28:14.266
(walkers growling )

28:42.555 --> 28:44.386
Damn it.

28:52.398 --> 28:54.730
( kicking )

28:54.901 --> 28:57.062
( grunts, pants )

29:12.418 --> 29:14.158
Oh, shit.

29:21.218 --> 29:23.960
(engine clanking)

29:24.138 --> 29:25.674
- Damn.
- Lori: What's wrong?

29:25.848 --> 29:28.089
We've been riding red
for the past hour.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.258
Better make sure
we don't get forgot.

29:30.436 --> 29:32.267
(truck honks)

29:48.537 --> 29:51.574
- Daryl: You out?
- Rick: Running on fumes.

29:51.749 --> 29:53.865
Maggie:
We can't stay here.

29:54.043 --> 29:55.533
Glenn:
We can't all fit in one car.

29:55.711 --> 29:57.451
We'll have to make a run
for some gas in the morning.

29:57.630 --> 30:00.212
- Spend the night here?
- I'm freezing.

30:00.383 --> 30:01.714
We'll build a fire, yeah?

30:01.884 --> 30:04.000
You go out looking
for firewood, stay close.

30:04.178 --> 30:06.385
Only got so many arrows.
How you doing on ammo?

30:06.555 --> 30:08.091
Notenough.

30:08.265 --> 30:09.846
Maggie: We can'tjust sit here
with our asses hanging out.

30:10.017 --> 30:11.632
Hershel:
Watch your mouth.

30:11.811 --> 30:13.722
Everyone stop panicking
and listen to Rick.

30:13.896 --> 30:16.057
All right, we'll set up
a perimeter.

30:16.232 --> 30:18.564
In the morning, we'll find gas
and some supplies.

30:18.734 --> 30:19.985
We'll keep pushing on.

30:20.152 --> 30:22.484
Glenn and I can go make a run now,
try and scrounge up some gas.

30:22.655 --> 30:24.816
No, we stay together.
God forbid something happens

30:24.991 --> 30:26.527
and people get
stranded without a car.

30:26.701 --> 30:29.238
Rick, we're stranded now.

30:29.412 --> 30:32.495
I know it looks bad, we've all been
through hell and worse,

30:32.665 --> 30:34.530
but at least
we found each other.

30:35.876 --> 30:37.252
I wasn't sure--
I really wasn't--

30:37.420 --> 30:39.376
but we did.
We're together.

30:39.547 --> 30:41.583
We keep it that way.

30:44.677 --> 30:47.464
We'll find shelter somewhere.
There's gotta be a place.

30:51.058 --> 30:53.765
Rick, look around.
Okay?

30:53.936 --> 30:56.018
There's walkers everywhere.
They're migrating or something.

30:56.188 --> 30:58.600
There's gotta be a place
not just where we hole up,

30:58.774 --> 31:00.480
but that we fortify,

31:01.944 --> 31:04.230
hunker down,
pull ourselves together,

31:04.405 --> 31:05.895
build a life for each other.

31:06.073 --> 31:08.689
I know it's out there.
We just have to find it.

31:08.868 --> 31:11.200
Maggie:
Even if we do find a place

31:11.370 --> 31:13.156
and we think it's safe,

31:13.330 --> 31:15.457
we can never be sure.
For how long?

31:15.624 --> 31:17.876
Look what happened
with the farm.

31:18.044 --> 31:20.410
We fooled ourselves
into thinking that that was safe.

31:20.588 --> 31:22.704
We won't make
that mistake again.

31:25.051 --> 31:26.712
We'll make camp tonight

31:26.886 --> 31:29.673
over there, get on the road
at the break of day.

31:30.890 --> 31:33.381
Does this feel
right to you?

31:33.559 --> 31:34.799
What if walkers
come through,

31:34.977 --> 31:36.217
or another group
like Randall's?

31:36.395 --> 31:38.602
You know
I found Randall, right?

31:38.773 --> 31:41.435
He had turned,
but he wasn't bit.

31:44.070 --> 31:46.903
- How's that possible?
- Rick, what the hell happened?

31:48.199 --> 31:51.783
Shane killed Randall.
Just like he always wanted to.

31:51.952 --> 31:54.204
Lori:
And then the herd got him?

32:04.256 --> 32:06.247
We're all infected.

32:13.599 --> 32:15.135
What?

32:15.309 --> 32:18.346
At the CDC,
Jenner told me.

32:20.106 --> 32:22.062
Whatever it is,

32:22.233 --> 32:24.474
we all carry it.

32:33.452 --> 32:35.238
And you never
said anything?

32:35.412 --> 32:37.403
Would it have made
a difference?

32:37.581 --> 32:39.321
You knew this whole time?

32:39.500 --> 32:41.786
How could I have known for sure?
You saw how crazy that mo--

32:41.961 --> 32:44.327
That is not your call.

32:44.505 --> 32:46.245
Okay, when I found out about
the walkers in the barn,

32:46.423 --> 32:47.708
I told, for the good
of everyone.

32:47.883 --> 32:50.044
Well, I thought it best
that people didn't know.

33:41.395 --> 33:43.932
I'm sure
you had your reasons.

33:45.858 --> 33:48.190
- Is there anything that--
- I killed him.

33:52.615 --> 33:54.651
I killed Shane.

33:58.579 --> 34:00.490
He came at me.

34:03.626 --> 34:06.618
He killed Randall
to get me into the woods.

34:06.795 --> 34:08.831
He planned it.

34:10.758 --> 34:13.340
I had--
I had no choice.

34:18.974 --> 34:21.181
I gave him every chance...

34:23.854 --> 34:26.186
and he kept
leading me further out.

34:29.318 --> 34:32.856
He pushed me,
and I let him.

34:36.283 --> 34:38.319
After awhile, I knew--

34:38.494 --> 34:40.860
I knew what he was doing,
what he was up to.

34:44.083 --> 34:46.119
And I kept going.

34:48.629 --> 34:50.415
I didn't stop.

34:52.174 --> 34:54.085
I could have, but...

34:56.345 --> 34:58.552
| just wanted it over.

35:01.100 --> 35:03.466
Dogging me
every step of the way.

35:05.187 --> 35:08.350
Acting like I stole
you and Carl, like--

35:09.483 --> 35:11.519
like I was in the way.

35:19.660 --> 35:21.696
| just wanted it over.

35:24.248 --> 35:26.409
I wanted him dead.

35:32.214 --> 35:34.250
I killed him.

35:40.723 --> 35:42.429
He turned.

35:43.475 --> 35:45.636
That's how I knew Jenner--

35:45.811 --> 35:48.018
Jenner was right.

35:54.320 --> 35:56.356
Carl put him down.

36:02.036 --> 36:05.278
( exhales )

36:08.167 --> 36:10.078
(crying)

36:15.090 --> 36:17.001
(grunts)

36:59.385 --> 37:01.376
- ( walkers growling )
-( panting )

37:07.184 --> 37:09.220
(grunting)

37:24.743 --> 37:27.405
(screaming )

38:13.834 --> 38:15.699
(whispering )
We're not safe with him--

38:15.878 --> 38:18.335
keeping something
like that from us.

38:20.549 --> 38:22.835
Why do you need him?
He'sjust gonna pull you down.

38:23.010 --> 38:26.173
No. Rick's done
all right by me.

38:26.346 --> 38:28.302
You're his henchman

38:28.474 --> 38:31.011
and I'm a burden.

38:31.185 --> 38:33.050
We deserve better.

38:34.354 --> 38:36.310
What do you want?

38:37.691 --> 38:39.522
A man of honor.

38:40.527 --> 38:42.028
Rick has honor.

38:45.532 --> 38:47.739
I think we should
take our chances.

38:47.910 --> 38:49.741
Hershel:
Don't be foolish.

38:50.746 --> 38:52.737
There's no food, no fuel,

38:52.915 --> 38:54.906
- no ammo.
- ( leaves rustle )

38:55.083 --> 38:58.211
- What was that?
- Daryl: Could be anything.

38:58.378 --> 38:59.993
Could be a raccoon,
could be a possum.

39:00.172 --> 39:02.163
Glenn:
A walker.

39:02.341 --> 39:04.548
Carol: We need to leave.
What are we waiting for?

39:04.718 --> 39:08.006
- Glenn: Which way?
- Maggie: It came from over there.

39:08.180 --> 39:10.011
- Beth: Back from where we came.
- Maggie: Yeah.

39:10.182 --> 39:13.219
The last thing we need is for everyone
to be running off in the dark.

39:13.393 --> 39:15.554
We don't have the vehicles.

39:15.729 --> 39:17.594
No one's traveling on foot.

39:17.773 --> 39:19.684
Hershel:
Don't panic.

39:19.858 --> 39:21.598
I'm not--

39:21.777 --> 39:24.689
I'm not sitting here, waiting for
another herd to blow through.

39:24.863 --> 39:27.855
- We need to move, now.
- No one is going anywhere.

39:30.744 --> 39:33.952
- Do something.
- I am doing something!

39:34.122 --> 39:35.737
I'm keeping
this group together,

39:35.916 --> 39:37.247
alive.

39:37.417 --> 39:39.624
I've been doing that all along,
no matter what.

39:39.795 --> 39:42.878
I didn't ask for this.
I killed my best friend

39:43.048 --> 39:44.879
for you people,
for Christ's sake!

39:53.308 --> 39:55.264
You saw what he was like,

39:55.435 --> 39:57.471
how he pushed me,

39:57.646 --> 40:00.228
how he compromised us,

40:00.399 --> 40:03.607
how he threatened us.

40:05.445 --> 40:07.106
He staged
the whole Randall thing,

40:07.281 --> 40:09.397
led me out to put
a bullet in my back.

40:09.575 --> 40:11.406
He gave me no choice.

40:11.577 --> 40:14.865
He was my friend,
but he came after me.

40:15.914 --> 40:18.326
( Carl crying )

40:21.169 --> 40:22.955
My hands are clean.

40:33.932 --> 40:36.514
Maybe you people are
better off without me.

40:37.644 --> 40:39.350
Go ahead.

40:39.521 --> 40:41.807
I say there's a place for us,

40:41.982 --> 40:43.643
but maybe-- maybe it's
just another pipe dream.

40:43.817 --> 40:47.105
Maybe-- maybe I'm
fooling myself again.

40:47.279 --> 40:50.442
Why don't you-- why don't you go
and find out yourself?

40:50.616 --> 40:52.572
Send me a postcard.

40:54.161 --> 40:55.901
Go on, there's the door.

40:57.164 --> 40:59.701
You can do better?
Let's see how far you get.

41:05.047 --> 41:08.539
No takers? Fine.
But get one thing straight--

41:10.969 --> 41:12.800
you're staying,

41:12.971 --> 41:15.553
this isn't
a democracy anymore.
