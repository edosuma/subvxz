She has a gift,
this one.

01:54.081 --> 01:57.216
Fact, 16 of my setups
led to marriage,

Maybe squinting

for our brains.

09:07.881 --> 09:10.549

I know this dude
who knows this other dude

09:23.630 --> 09:25.564
who went up to the roof
and got every channel

09:25.566 --> 09:28.600
by jamming a pair of tweezers
into the antenna thingy.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.235
It sounds like a great idea!

09:30.237 --> 09:30.835
So it's settled.

09:30.837 --> 09:33.371
Next time we're home alone,
you'll go up to the roof,

09:33.373 --> 09:35.440
and I'll stay down here
and see if it works.

09:35.442 --> 09:36.041
Why do I have to go?

You're making
a lot of sense today.

happens, we gotta
keep this quiet

a perfect dream woman,

17:27.480 --> 17:28.513

17:28.515 --> 17:30.248
Yeah, me, too. (SIGHS)

17:30.250 --> 17:34.085

just about the boobs for me.

17:34.788 --> 17:38.156

hanging out with you.

17:38.857 --> 17:39.457
Had its moments.

Mind if I hang out

18:25.170 --> 18:27.605
What happened to your date?

18:28.140 --> 18:30.308
Eh, wasn't feeling it.

18:31.076 --> 18:32.510
Look.

18:32.512 --> 18:39.884
I know you worked hard

I'm sorry, too.

you won't close
yourself off forever.
