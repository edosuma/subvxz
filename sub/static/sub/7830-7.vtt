00:09.217 --> 00:10.844
D'oh!

00:10.927 --> 00:12.220
-Aah!
-(tires screech)

00:14.014 --> 00:15.140
(shout)

00:30.989 --> 00:32.198
Skinner!

00:32.282 --> 00:35.368
(gasps) Uh,
Superintendent Chalmers!

00:35.452 --> 00:36.953
What's wrong?

00:37.037 --> 00:38.997
Nothing.
I just bought myself a car.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.999
Oh. Oh, good.

00:41.082 --> 00:42.876
This will sound crazy

00:42.959 --> 00:45.712
but at first, I thought
I'd enraged you again.

00:45.795 --> 00:47.297
-Skinner!
-What? What?

00:47.380 --> 00:50.008
Ah, you're getting paranoid.

00:50.091 --> 00:51.968
You know,
I used to think a car

00:52.052 --> 00:53.887
was just a way of getting
from point "A" to point "B"

00:53.970 --> 00:56.931
and on weekends, point "C,"
but that was the old me.

00:57.015 --> 01:02.812
That man died the moment I laid eyes
on the 1979 Honda Accord.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.898
I've always admired car owners,

01:04.981 --> 01:06.816
and I hope to be one myself

01:06.900 --> 01:08.777
as soon as I finish
paying off Mother.

01:08.860 --> 01:10.987
She insists I pay
her retroactively

01:11.071 --> 01:12.530
for the food
I ate as a child.

01:12.614 --> 01:14.908
Yeah, yeah.
That's unfortunate.

01:14.991 --> 01:17.660
Well, Seymour,
I make superintendent money

01:17.744 --> 01:20.288
which amply covers
both food and car.

01:20.371 --> 01:23.083
Holy jumping Caesar's catfish!

01:23.166 --> 01:24.709
My "H" has been stolen.

01:24.793 --> 01:27.504
Oh, that's how people
know it's a Honda.

01:27.587 --> 01:29.130
What's the point
of having a Honda

01:29.214 --> 01:30.507
if you can't show it off?

01:30.590 --> 01:33.301
Sir, if you'll just
stop yelling at me

01:33.384 --> 01:34.886
I'm sure I can
find a replacement.

01:37.055 --> 01:38.807
(grunting)
Here we... I'll just...

01:38.890 --> 01:40.850
Hey! Get away from my car!

01:40.934 --> 01:42.060
-Uh-oh. This way.
-Uh-oh.

01:46.064 --> 01:47.482
(register bell dings)

01:50.735 --> 01:51.903
(chuckling)

01:53.321 --> 01:54.322
(whistling)

01:54.405 --> 01:56.282
Eh... morning, Apu.

01:56.366 --> 01:57.826
Good morning.

01:57.909 --> 01:59.869
One doughnut
with sprinkles...

01:59.953 --> 02:02.956
(gasps) Wait a minute,
these are not sprinkles, sir.

02:03.039 --> 02:04.833
-What do you mean?
-You've clearly taken items

02:04.916 --> 02:07.335
from the candy rack and placed them
on top of the doughnut

02:07.418 --> 02:09.170
in an attempt
to pass them off as sprinkles.

02:09.254 --> 02:11.756
Well, it was like that
when I got here.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.551
-It really was.
-A Mounds bar is not a sprinkle.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.427
A Twizzler is not a sprinkle.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.930
A Jolly Rancher
is not a sprinkle, sir.

02:19.013 --> 02:21.641
Perhaps in Shangri-La
they are, but not here.

02:21.724 --> 02:24.477
-(moans)
-(bell chimes)

02:24.561 --> 02:26.437
APU:
Thank you. Come again.

02:26.521 --> 02:29.023
(police radio chatter)

02:29.107 --> 02:30.859
Ah, looks like
we put the kibosh

02:30.942 --> 02:32.861
on another two-bit
telephone swindle, boys.

02:32.944 --> 02:36.156
Frankly, I would have expected
better from Jimmy the Scumbag.

02:36.239 --> 02:37.282
Meh.

02:40.660 --> 02:44.164
-Hey, what's this thing?
-Huh? Well, that's an auto-dialer.

02:44.247 --> 02:47.041
This bird was using it to
pull a telemarketing scam.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.043
But instead, he's going
to rot in the slammer

02:49.127 --> 02:50.587
for the next 20 years.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.714
Bread and water,
icy showers,

02:52.797 --> 02:55.049
guards whomping
your ass round the clock,

02:55.133 --> 02:57.844
and the only way out
is suicide.

02:57.927 --> 03:00.471
Telemarketing, eh?

03:02.599 --> 03:03.725
(snickering)

03:03.808 --> 03:04.893
Ha-ha!

03:04.976 --> 03:07.896
(boys laughing)

03:07.979 --> 03:10.899
Oh, you think
this stolen "H"

03:10.982 --> 03:12.984
is a laugh riot,
don't you?

03:13.067 --> 03:15.320
Well, I'll tell you
something that's not so funny.

03:15.403 --> 03:17.947
Right now Superintendent
Chalmers is at home

03:18.031 --> 03:19.908
crying like a little girl.

03:19.991 --> 03:21.701
(loud laughter)

03:21.784 --> 03:25.121
(chuckling)
I guess it is a little funny.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.540
Nonetheless,
I will find the culprit.

03:27.624 --> 03:31.461
We'll start with...
oh, I don't know...

03:31.544 --> 03:32.837
Bart Simpson.

03:35.673 --> 03:37.467
Um, I don't think you want
to look in there, sir.

03:37.550 --> 03:40.762
Balderdash. I'll just
stick my head right in...

03:40.845 --> 03:43.890
half a dozen eggs?

03:43.973 --> 03:47.101
Well, that would be
the complete dozen.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.562
All right, rather than tempt
fate, I'll move along now.

03:49.646 --> 03:53.316
And so we reach
the bottom of the barrel,

03:53.399 --> 03:54.359
Nelson Muntz.

03:54.442 --> 03:56.069
(hums fanfare)

03:56.152 --> 03:58.863
The cold, hard process
of elimination places the "H"

03:58.947 --> 04:01.115
squarely in your locker.

04:03.034 --> 04:04.077
(both gasp)

04:04.160 --> 04:05.328
Ha-ha!

04:07.205 --> 04:09.666
Damn! Dang! Darn!

04:13.836 --> 04:17.799
(gasping) A principal's ransom
in stolen goods.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.008
Well, sir,

04:19.092 --> 04:20.969
who's ha-ha-ing now, hmm?

04:21.052 --> 04:24.347
I don't know, but he's
got lethal tuna-breath.

04:24.430 --> 04:26.933
ALL: Ooh!

04:27.016 --> 04:28.977
Who does Nelson think
he's impressing anyway

04:29.060 --> 04:31.145
acting so cool
all the time?

04:31.229 --> 04:32.689
Not me.

04:32.772 --> 04:34.983
All right, Mr. Smartenheimer,
that does it.

04:35.066 --> 04:38.111
First, you're going to give back
everything you've stolen.

04:38.194 --> 04:39.946
Then I'm sentencing you
to one week

04:40.029 --> 04:42.991
of the lowest, most degrading
work known to man.

04:43.074 --> 04:45.326
-Janitorial work.
-Ah, gee.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.578
I'm standing right here, sir.

04:47.662 --> 04:50.164
Ah, yes. Uh...

04:50.248 --> 04:51.791
Take a good look
at him, Nelson,

04:51.874 --> 04:53.918
'cause that's where
you're headed.

04:54.002 --> 04:56.170
After you claim
your stolen merchandise,

04:56.254 --> 04:59.549
go directly to Mr. Muntz
for an apology.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.009
Bite me.

05:01.092 --> 05:02.510
Cram it.

05:02.593 --> 05:04.178
You're dead.

05:04.262 --> 05:06.431
Get bent, ma'am.

05:06.514 --> 05:08.308
Why do you have to be such
a pain all the time?

05:08.391 --> 05:10.643
Don't you realize you're
getting a bad reputation?

05:10.727 --> 05:13.187
Don't you realize
your butt sticks out?

05:13.271 --> 05:15.148
It does not.

05:15.231 --> 05:16.816
-Hey!
-Ha-ha!

05:19.152 --> 05:22.322
An automatic dialer?
Is that legal?

05:22.405 --> 05:24.157
I don't want you
getting arrested, Homer.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.366
I won't.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.744
Or swindling our neighbors.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.495
Let me show you
how it works.

05:29.579 --> 05:33.166
This baby has every phone number
in town programmed into it.

05:33.249 --> 05:37.211
It automatically calls them
one by one and plays my message.

05:37.295 --> 05:38.338
Listen.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.465
(touch tones beeping)

05:40.548 --> 05:41.674
(telephone ringing)

05:41.758 --> 05:42.884
Ahoy-hoy?

05:42.967 --> 05:45.511
HOMER:
<i>Greetings, friend.</i>

05:45.595 --> 05:47.638
<i>Do you wish to look</i>
<i>as happy as me?</i>

05:47.722 --> 05:50.683
<i>Well, you've got the power</i>
<i>inside you right now,</i>

05:50.767 --> 05:54.312
<i>so use it and send one</i>
<i>dollar to Happy Dude,</i>

05:54.395 --> 05:56.522
<i>742 Evergreen Terrace,</i>
<i>Springfield.</i>

05:56.606 --> 05:58.232
<i>Don't delay.</i>

05:58.316 --> 06:00.193
<i>Eternal happiness</i>
<i>is just a dollar away.</i>

06:01.319 --> 06:02.779
Hmm...

06:02.862 --> 06:06.074
one dollar
for eternal happiness.

06:06.157 --> 06:07.700
Mmm...

06:07.784 --> 06:09.243
I'd be happier
with the dollar.

06:09.327 --> 06:12.205
(chuckling) Now we just sit
by the mailbox

06:12.288 --> 06:14.123
and watch
the money roll in.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.209
But you're going to annoy
thousands of people

06:16.292 --> 06:18.586
just to make
a few measly dollars.

06:18.669 --> 06:20.296
It's nothing but panhandling.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.256
Tele-panhandling.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.759
And should there be requests
for an encore,

06:24.842 --> 06:28.012
we will reprise
"Pop Goes the Weasel."

06:28.096 --> 06:30.348
Otherwise, we will
file out quietly.

06:30.431 --> 06:33.101
-(sighs)
-(water splashing)

06:33.184 --> 06:35.144
And that's how Willie waters.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.188
Now, you take the hoose.

06:37.271 --> 06:38.523
The moose?

06:38.606 --> 06:40.149
The hoose! The hoose!

06:40.233 --> 06:41.234
Is this right?

06:41.317 --> 06:43.277
Agh, turn off the noozle!

06:43.361 --> 06:45.071
The noodles? What noodles?

06:45.154 --> 06:46.322
The noozle at the end
of the hoose.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.365
(laughing)

06:47.448 --> 06:49.075
Miss Simpson?

06:49.158 --> 06:52.286
Do you find something funny
about the word tromboner?

06:52.370 --> 06:56.082
No, sir. I was laughing
at something outside.

06:56.165 --> 06:57.500
She was looking at Nelson.

06:57.583 --> 07:00.253
ALL:
<i>♪ Lisa likes Nelson ♪</i>

07:00.336 --> 07:01.421
She does not.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.840
<i>♪ Milhouse likes Lisa ♪</i>

07:03.923 --> 07:04.841
He does not.

07:04.924 --> 07:07.385
<i>♪ Janey likes Milhouse ♪</i>

07:07.468 --> 07:08.636
She does not!

07:08.719 --> 07:11.305
<i>♪ Uter likes Milhouse ♪</i>

07:11.389 --> 07:12.765
Nobody likes Milhouse.

07:12.849 --> 07:15.059
Lisa, you've got detention.

07:15.143 --> 07:17.145
(grumbling)

07:26.195 --> 07:29.115
Oh, how does Bart
do this every week?

07:29.198 --> 07:32.160
Hey, brainiac. Since when
do you get detention?

07:32.243 --> 07:35.538
It's your fault. I accidentally laughed
at your immature prank.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.165
Ha! Yeah.

07:37.248 --> 07:39.750
The best part
was when he got wet.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.419
Hey, you're doing that
the stupid way.

07:41.502 --> 07:43.504
If you use that deal
with the five chalks

07:43.588 --> 07:45.298
you'll get done faster.

07:45.381 --> 07:47.216
Thanks, but I prefer
the honest way.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.135
Whatever.
Smell you later.

07:56.184 --> 07:57.059
Hmm.

08:05.276 --> 08:07.612
Wow, that was
a good idea,

08:07.695 --> 08:09.363
and I can't believe
it came from Nelson.

08:11.073 --> 08:13.367
(thinking) <i>He's not like anybody</i>
<i>I've ever met.</i>

08:13.451 --> 08:15.328
<i>He's like a riddle</i>
<i>wrapped in an enigma</i>

08:15.411 --> 08:17.330
<i>wrapped in a vest.</i>

08:17.413 --> 08:19.790
<i>Sure is ugly, though.</i>

08:19.874 --> 08:23.169
<i>So why can't I stop</i>
<i>staring at him?</i>

08:23.252 --> 08:25.421
<i>Oh, no.</i>

08:25.505 --> 08:29.175
<i>I think I'm getting a crush</i>
<i>on Nelson Muntz.</i>

08:29.258 --> 08:31.093
Hey, Willie!
Catch the football!

08:31.177 --> 08:32.512
All right, I'll--

08:32.595 --> 08:35.264
-(Willie screaming)
-(bees buzzing)

08:35.348 --> 08:36.265
(dreamy sigh)

08:43.356 --> 08:45.650
-(laughing)
-Milhouse, I've never told anyone

08:45.733 --> 08:47.193
this kind of thing before,

08:47.276 --> 08:49.737
but I've never felt
this way before.

08:49.820 --> 08:52.406
-I think I have a crush...
-(gasps)

08:52.490 --> 08:54.367
Uh, oh, really?

08:54.450 --> 08:55.952
On Nelson Muntz.

08:56.035 --> 08:57.787
(gagging)

08:57.870 --> 08:59.914
Way to drink, Poindexter!

08:59.997 --> 09:02.250
(coughing)
You like Nelson?

09:02.333 --> 09:04.168
(coughing)
But he's a creep,

09:04.252 --> 09:05.628
and he chipped
one of my permanent teeth.

09:05.711 --> 09:07.129
But I bet underneath

09:07.213 --> 09:09.507
he's a sweet, sensitive
person... like you.

09:10.967 --> 09:12.510
I guess you could say
I want to bring out

09:12.593 --> 09:14.262
the Milhouse in Nelson.

09:14.345 --> 09:16.931
But I'm all Milhouse!

09:17.014 --> 09:19.725
Plus, my mom says I'm the
handsomest guy in school.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.102
I like you too, Milhouse,

09:21.185 --> 09:23.521
but not in that way.

09:23.604 --> 09:26.440
-You're more like a big sister.
-No, I'm not.

09:26.524 --> 09:28.484
Why does everybody
keep saying that?

09:28.568 --> 09:30.236
Would you do me a favor?

09:30.319 --> 09:32.238
When you get back to class,
just give him this note.

09:32.321 --> 09:34.407
Ohh...

09:34.490 --> 09:35.992
Please?

09:36.075 --> 09:38.744
(thinking) <i>When she sees you'll do</i>
<i>anything she says,</i>

09:38.828 --> 09:41.122
<i>she's bound to respect you.</i>

09:41.205 --> 09:44.166
Sure!
What's a big sister for?

09:45.710 --> 09:47.712
Oh... I shouldn't
have said that.

09:51.882 --> 09:54.135
"Guess who likes you."

09:56.887 --> 09:57.930
(siren wailing)

10:02.643 --> 10:04.437
Milhouse, I'm so sorry.

10:04.520 --> 10:05.980
He can't hear you now.

10:06.063 --> 10:07.982
We had to pack
his ears with gauze.

10:10.776 --> 10:13.487
Nelson. Um...

10:13.571 --> 10:15.823
that note Milhouse gave you,

10:15.906 --> 10:16.991
it wasn't from him.

10:17.074 --> 10:20.036
It was from... me.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.747
You? Why would you like me?

10:22.830 --> 10:24.790
No girls like me.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.917
Are you wearing a wire?

10:27.001 --> 10:29.587
I don't know why
I like you, I just do.

10:29.670 --> 10:32.715
So... what do you think?

10:32.798 --> 10:35.509
It's okay... I guess.

10:35.593 --> 10:37.178
Do I have to do anything?

10:37.261 --> 10:39.597
Well, would you like

10:39.680 --> 10:41.349
to come over to my house
after school?

10:41.432 --> 10:44.018
Okay.
But if anybody sees us,

10:44.101 --> 10:45.811
I'm just there
to steal your bike.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.855
(tires screeching)

10:47.938 --> 10:51.525
(panting)
Huh? Ooh.

10:51.609 --> 10:55.321
Whoo-hoo!
Two dollars!

10:55.404 --> 10:56.947
It's working!

10:57.031 --> 10:58.866
I don't feel any happier.

10:58.949 --> 11:00.451
How about you?

11:00.534 --> 11:03.079
Mmm, a little.

11:03.162 --> 11:04.080
(wheels squeaking)

11:04.163 --> 11:05.915
Oh, you got to see this.

11:05.998 --> 11:08.000
It's so cute what she does.

11:08.084 --> 11:09.168
Be the baby, kitty.

11:09.251 --> 11:11.420
Go on. Be the baby!

11:11.504 --> 11:13.089
(laughs)
Come on.

11:13.172 --> 11:16.050
-(cat yowling)
-Snowball!

11:16.133 --> 11:17.885
-(cat shrieking)
-You don't understand.

11:17.968 --> 11:20.888
She loves to climb in here.

11:20.971 --> 11:23.099
I believe you!
I don't care!

11:23.182 --> 11:25.559
Hey, Lise, Mom said you had
the toenail clippers, and--

11:25.643 --> 11:28.062
Whoa, Lisa! Look out!
Nelson's in our house!

11:28.145 --> 11:30.523
It's okay.
I invited him over.

11:30.606 --> 11:34.151
-Nelson's my new friend.
-Are you nuts?

11:34.235 --> 11:35.319
I'll probably never
say this to you again,

11:35.403 --> 11:37.071
but you can do better.

11:37.154 --> 11:38.864
Please don't ruin
this for me, Bart.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.574
I think he's starting
to like me.

11:40.658 --> 11:43.119
-Milhouse likes you.
-Oh, please!

11:43.202 --> 11:44.787
Milhouse likes Vaseline
on toast.

11:44.870 --> 11:45.830
Hmm.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.958
(dialing)

11:49.041 --> 11:50.668
(whirring)

11:50.751 --> 11:53.963
Oh, pawns can't move that way,
you stupid arm!

11:54.046 --> 11:55.965
-(phone rings)
-Lab.

11:56.048 --> 11:57.717
HOMER (on recording):
<i>Greetings, friend.</i>

11:57.800 --> 11:59.593
<i>Do you wish to</i>
<i>look as happy as me?</i>

11:59.677 --> 12:02.930
(gasps) Why, it's the
AT-5000 auto-dialer,

12:03.013 --> 12:05.057
my very first patent.

12:05.141 --> 12:07.518
Ah, would you listen
to the gibberish

12:07.601 --> 12:08.561
they've got you saying?

12:08.644 --> 12:09.979
It's sad and alarming.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.981
You were designed
to alert schoolchildren

12:12.064 --> 12:14.191
about snow days and such.

12:14.275 --> 12:16.569
Well, let's get you home
to Frinky.

12:16.652 --> 12:19.947
-Hope your wheels still work.
-(keypad beeping)

12:20.030 --> 12:21.031
(vibrating, whirring)

12:25.661 --> 12:26.620
Oh, no, you don't.

12:28.831 --> 12:31.459
(grunts)

12:31.542 --> 12:33.252
You're the first person
I've had over to the house

12:33.335 --> 12:34.754
since my dad went nuts.

12:47.433 --> 12:48.893
"Nuke the whales"?

12:48.976 --> 12:51.228
You don't really
believe that, do you?

12:51.312 --> 12:53.689
I don't know.
Gotta nuke something.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.025
Touché.

12:56.108 --> 12:57.359
You play the guitar?

12:57.443 --> 12:59.653
Oh, yeah.
I'm a superstar.

12:59.737 --> 13:02.031
Would you play a song for me?

13:02.114 --> 13:04.867
Oh. Okay.

13:06.577 --> 13:08.329
(strings tuning)

13:12.333 --> 13:14.418
<i>♪ Joy to the world ♪</i>

13:14.502 --> 13:16.837
<i>♪ The teacher's dead ♪</i>

13:16.921 --> 13:20.800
<i>♪ We barbecued her head ♪</i>

13:20.883 --> 13:22.927
<i>♪ What happened to her body? ♪</i>

13:23.010 --> 13:25.095
<i>♪ We flushed it down</i>

13:25.179 --> 13:27.473
<i>♪ And round and round</i>

13:27.556 --> 13:31.268
<i>♪ And round and round</i>
<i>it... goes ♪</i>

13:31.352 --> 13:32.770
I wish I could laugh

13:32.853 --> 13:35.105
at the idea of a teacher
being decapitated.

13:35.189 --> 13:36.273
I know.

13:36.357 --> 13:37.691
(chuckles)
It's funny, huh?

13:37.775 --> 13:39.819
Hardly.

13:39.902 --> 13:42.404
Listen, I'm getting
pretty tired.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.532
I'm going to go
to sleep for a while.

13:44.615 --> 13:46.116
Smell you later.

13:46.200 --> 13:49.203
-How am I supposed to get home?
-I don't know.

13:49.286 --> 13:51.497
You should have thought of that
before you came over. Heh.

13:53.457 --> 13:54.959
I feel so stupid, Mom.

13:55.042 --> 13:56.669
Nelson's not right
for me at all,

13:56.752 --> 13:58.462
and I don't think
he ever will be.

13:58.546 --> 14:01.298
Well, most women will tell
you that you're a fool

14:01.382 --> 14:02.842
to think you can change a man,

14:02.925 --> 14:05.845
but those women are quitters.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.347
-What?
-When I first met your father,

14:08.430 --> 14:11.225
he was loud, crude,
and piggish,

14:11.308 --> 14:15.187
but I worked hard on him,
and now he's a whole new person.

14:15.271 --> 14:19.650
-Mom?
-He's a whole new person, Lisa.

14:19.733 --> 14:21.235
Oh, I know.

14:21.318 --> 14:22.862
Mmm.

14:22.945 --> 14:24.655
I wonder if I could
change Nelson.

14:26.407 --> 14:27.908
Very sharp.

14:27.992 --> 14:30.536
Oh, but I feel
like such a tool.

14:30.619 --> 14:32.162
I know it's a change,

14:32.246 --> 14:33.998
but it highlights your sweet
and sensitive side.

14:34.081 --> 14:35.666
Aw, crap.

14:37.167 --> 14:38.544
LISA:
Isn't it nice up here?

14:38.627 --> 14:40.296
What are you thinking,
Nelson?

14:40.379 --> 14:42.256
What am I thinking about what?

14:42.339 --> 14:44.216
-About anything.
-Nothing.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.468
Mm... what do you feel?

14:46.552 --> 14:48.178
What's inside you right now?

14:48.262 --> 14:51.348
Guts and black stuff...

14:51.432 --> 14:52.933
and about 50 Slim Jims.

14:53.017 --> 14:55.811
Come on, Nelson,
you must think and feel things.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.521
I mean, look where we are...

14:57.605 --> 15:00.232
a rolling, green hillside,
the stars coming out

15:00.316 --> 15:02.276
like God is lighting
a million tiny candles.

15:02.359 --> 15:04.904
The moon looking down
on us as if to say...

15:06.572 --> 15:08.324
<i>(gasps)</i>
<i>My first kiss.</i>

15:08.407 --> 15:10.200
<i>I always wondered</i>
<i>what it would be like.</i>

15:10.284 --> 15:12.369
<i>This ought to shut her up.</i>

15:12.453 --> 15:15.497
<i>Hey... this isn't so bad.</i>

15:27.217 --> 15:28.719
That was pretty fine.

15:28.802 --> 15:30.804
See? You do have
a tender side.

15:30.888 --> 15:33.223
You just needed someone
to bring it out.

15:33.307 --> 15:36.352
Yeah. That was
pretty rockin'.

15:41.315 --> 15:44.443
Oh, man!
You kissed a girl!

15:44.526 --> 15:47.112
That is so gay!

15:47.196 --> 15:51.367
Listen, you thugs!
Stop making fun of him or you'll be sorry.

15:51.450 --> 15:53.327
ALL: Whoa!

15:53.410 --> 15:55.162
You'll be so sorry
when you realize

15:55.245 --> 15:57.247
how you've hurt the feelings
of a sweet young man.

15:57.331 --> 15:58.999
(groaning)

15:59.083 --> 16:02.461
He's not like you anymore.
He's changed.

16:02.544 --> 16:04.254
And he doesn't want
to hang around

16:04.338 --> 16:06.340
with a bunch of crumb-bums.

16:06.423 --> 16:07.758
Crumb-bums?

16:07.841 --> 16:09.969
Nobody calls me a crumb-bum.

16:10.052 --> 16:12.680
Hey, back off, James.

16:12.763 --> 16:15.391
I'll handle this, Lisa.
You go have a fig bar.

16:20.729 --> 16:23.399
Hey, thanks for
embarrassing me, dingus.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.484
You asked for it, man.

16:25.567 --> 16:26.777
You're broadcasting
geek rays

16:26.860 --> 16:28.320
over the entire valley.

16:28.404 --> 16:31.031
'Fraid not.
I'm still wicked bad.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.200
Oh, yeah?
Then prove it, ass butt.

16:33.283 --> 16:34.827
Come raid Skinner's
house with us.

16:34.910 --> 16:36.829
We found a bunch
of rancid coleslaw

16:36.912 --> 16:38.956
in the Dumpster
behind Krusty Burger.

16:39.039 --> 16:42.126
Yeah, and we're going
to go heave it at his house.

16:42.209 --> 16:43.544
Cool!

16:43.627 --> 16:45.087
I'd love to get even
with Skinner.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.714
Uh...

16:46.797 --> 16:49.299
Uh, but I better not.

16:50.634 --> 16:52.261
(clucking)
Chicken!

16:52.344 --> 16:53.595
-Lame-o!
-Girl lover!

16:53.679 --> 16:56.181
-Fancy pants!
-Charlatan!

16:56.265 --> 16:59.685
You got rid of them,
and you did it like a gentleman

16:59.768 --> 17:01.645
without any violence.

17:01.729 --> 17:02.938
Yeah.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.690
I know you don't
like that stuff.

17:06.817 --> 17:07.693
(touch tones beeping)

17:11.655 --> 17:12.740
(phone ringing)

17:12.823 --> 17:14.074
NED:
Howdily-diddely.

17:14.158 --> 17:15.367
HOMER:
<i>Greetings, friends.</i>

17:15.451 --> 17:16.994
<i>Do you wish to look as--</i>

17:17.077 --> 17:20.164
Oh, it was that
darn recording again.

17:20.247 --> 17:21.999
Of course it was.

17:22.082 --> 17:25.753
It's been calling all night.
Just unplug the phone.

17:25.836 --> 17:27.921
-(phone ringing)
-Howdily...

17:28.005 --> 17:29.757
<i>-Greetings, friends.</i>
-Dang!

17:29.840 --> 17:31.925
I told you to unplug the phone.

17:32.009 --> 17:33.594
-But it could be my mother.
-(ringing)

17:33.677 --> 17:34.803
-Howdy--
<i>-Greetings, friends.</i>

17:34.887 --> 17:36.388
-Shoot!
-That is it, Ned.

17:36.472 --> 17:38.015
If you don't unplug
that phone right now,

17:38.098 --> 17:39.725
you're sleeping on the lawn.

17:39.808 --> 17:41.977
Will you two shut up?

17:42.061 --> 17:43.604
People are trying to sleep!

17:47.608 --> 17:49.485
(loud thumping)

17:49.568 --> 17:52.071
Great Barrier Reef!
We're under attack!

17:52.154 --> 17:53.781
Eat slaw, Skinner!

17:53.864 --> 17:55.616
We're slawing him
up good!

17:55.699 --> 17:57.743
Nelson doesn't know
what he's missing.

17:57.826 --> 18:00.788
Why is he wasting his time
with that Simpson chick?

18:00.871 --> 18:03.999
'Cause your mom had
a three-month waiting list.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.126
-All right!
-I knew you'd be back.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.669
Hey, what'd you say
about my mom?

18:07.753 --> 18:08.837
(all talking at once)

18:08.921 --> 18:10.464
I missed you guys.

18:10.547 --> 18:12.591
Let's never fight again.

18:21.058 --> 18:24.645
Who's out there? Give me your names
so I can tell the police.

18:24.728 --> 18:27.022
AGNES: Seymour,
what's going on?

18:27.106 --> 18:28.023
What's that odor?

18:28.107 --> 18:29.775
Go back to bed, Mother.

18:29.858 --> 18:32.111
I've got it under control.
Listen, you crumb-bums.

18:32.194 --> 18:36.031
If you think I'm impressed,
I am not. (stammers)

18:36.115 --> 18:39.118
Oh, brandishing your buttocks
is only getting me angrier.

18:39.201 --> 18:40.869
AGNES: I want to see
what's going on!

18:40.953 --> 18:43.247
No, Mother,
don't look out the window!

18:43.330 --> 18:46.125
-(Mother screaming)
-(sighs)

18:46.208 --> 18:49.378
-(siren wailing)
-Cops! Everybody split up.

18:58.804 --> 19:01.348
-(thuds)
-Lisa, the cops are chasing me.

19:01.431 --> 19:02.766
I need a place to hide.

19:02.850 --> 19:05.018
Lisa's window is the next one.

19:05.102 --> 19:06.812
(phone ringing)

19:06.895 --> 19:08.230
-NED: Howdly-doo...
<i>-Greetings, friends.</i>

19:08.313 --> 19:09.815
MAUDE: Ned, did you plug
that phone back in?

19:09.898 --> 19:11.775
Shut up!

19:13.110 --> 19:15.028
And I wasn't
even there, honest.

19:15.112 --> 19:16.864
Skinner's just out to get me.

19:16.947 --> 19:18.866
-That's so unfair.
-(siren approaching)

19:18.949 --> 19:20.033
Uh-oh.

19:20.117 --> 19:21.743
Meet me at the back door.

19:28.292 --> 19:31.253
Aha! I had a feeling
we'd find you here.

19:32.546 --> 19:34.673
-Chief, no!
-What'd you do that for?

19:34.756 --> 19:37.593
Well, that thing's been
driving the whole town nuts.

19:37.676 --> 19:40.262
Got me out of the bath
seven times. Seven!

19:40.345 --> 19:42.931
Hey, who shot the auto-dialer?

19:43.015 --> 19:44.266
Marge's auto-dialer.

19:44.349 --> 19:45.767
See you in court, Simpson.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.895
Oh, and, uh, bring
that evidence with you.

19:47.978 --> 19:50.981
Otherwise, I got no case
and you'll go scot-free, you know.

19:51.064 --> 19:53.066
Uh, Chief, what about
those coleslaw punks?

19:53.150 --> 19:56.862
Well, I can't be everywhere
at once, Lou, now can I?

19:56.945 --> 19:58.739
You know, in most cities,
the chief of police

19:58.822 --> 20:00.741
doesn't even go out
on calls like these.

20:00.824 --> 20:03.076
-Yeah, yeah. We know, Chief.
-We appreciate it.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.828
-Count our blessings every day.
-We're very appreciative.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.207
I think they're giving up.

20:08.290 --> 20:12.711
Thanks for helping me out.
You're a stand-up babe.

20:12.794 --> 20:14.379
Hey, check it out.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.882
Skinner's mopping the goo
off his house.

20:16.965 --> 20:20.302
Wait till he finds
what I left in his birdbath.

20:20.385 --> 20:21.887
SKINNER: No!

20:26.058 --> 20:27.893
I thought you weren't there.

20:27.976 --> 20:28.936
Huh?

20:29.019 --> 20:32.105
Oh, yeah.
Uh... I guess I was.

20:32.189 --> 20:34.024
-You lied to me.
-Nuh-uh.

20:34.107 --> 20:35.943
There. You did it again.

20:36.026 --> 20:38.570
All right, all right, I lied.
I'm sorry. Let's kiss.

20:38.654 --> 20:41.073
No! You don't understand,
Nelson.

20:41.156 --> 20:43.700
A kiss doesn't mean anything
if it's dishonest.

20:43.784 --> 20:47.079
Um... there's
a niceness to it.

20:47.162 --> 20:49.957
I was foolish to think
I'd actually changed you.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.750
Maybe I was
seeing things in you

20:51.833 --> 20:53.669
that weren't really there.

20:53.752 --> 20:55.003
Definitely.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.964
Then why did you want
to be with me?

20:57.047 --> 21:00.217
Mmm-mm, maybe 'cause you
were the first person

21:00.300 --> 21:02.886
that ever thought there
was a nice guy inside me.

21:02.970 --> 21:07.766
Hmm. Well, guess you really
blew that one, huh?

21:07.849 --> 21:09.559
Well, I guess this is it.

21:09.643 --> 21:11.270
You mean, like, good-bye?

21:11.353 --> 21:14.606
Let's just call it
"smell you later."

21:26.618 --> 21:28.453
(sniffing)

21:31.081 --> 21:32.708
Hi, Lisa.

21:32.791 --> 21:34.251
Could I talk to you,

21:34.334 --> 21:36.586
or would that just make
Nelson whale on me again?

21:36.670 --> 21:39.798
Don't worry. Nelson and I don't
like each other anymore.

21:39.881 --> 21:41.550
(gasps)
Really?

21:41.633 --> 21:44.303
You got anybody in mind
for your next crush?

21:44.386 --> 21:48.390
Well, I'm really not
thinking about that now.

21:48.473 --> 21:51.476
I suppose it could be
almost anybody.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.020
Yes!

21:59.401 --> 22:01.153

22:01.236 --> 22:03.488
