00:41.332 --> 00:45.503
Letters From Iwo Jima

00:55.638 --> 00:59.309
IWO JIMA

02:10.422 --> 02:13.925
How did those soldiers ever manage
to dig out these tunnels?

02:14.801 --> 02:16.219
Let's get a rotation in here.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.263
Hey, I found something!

02:30.358 --> 02:33.111
IWO JIMA

02:33.278 --> 02:34.404
<i>Hanako...</i>

02:35.363 --> 02:37.282
<i>We soldiers dig.</i>

02:37.782 --> 02:40.452
<i>We dig all day.</i>

02:42.454 --> 02:44.539
<i>This is the hole that we will fight...</i>

02:45.331 --> 02:47.083
<i>and die in.</i>

02:49.419 --> 02:50.879
<i>Hanako...</i>

02:51.421 --> 02:54.674
<i>am I digging my own grave?</i>

03:28.416 --> 03:31.961
<i>Today, I head for the post
where my men await.</i>

03:32.837 --> 03:37.050
<i>I am determined to serve
and give my life for my country.</i>

03:38.176 --> 03:40.720
<i>I believe I have organized
everything at home...</i>

03:40.887 --> 03:45.517
<i>but I am sorry I wasn 't able to attend
to the kitchen floor before I left.</i>

03:46.184 --> 03:47.977
<i>I had all the intention...</i>

03:48.144 --> 03:50.480
<i>but had to leave
without having the time...</i>

03:50.897 --> 03:52.982
<i>and I am still worried about it.</i>

03:53.233 --> 03:56.361
<i>So make sure to have
Taro take care of it promptly.</i>

04:02.450 --> 04:06.413
Damn this island!
The Americans can have it.

04:08.873 --> 04:10.208
Nothing grows here.

04:11.167 --> 04:16.214
It smells. It's hot. There are too many
damn bugs, and there's no water.

04:18.507 --> 04:22.303
This island is part
of Japan's sacred homeland.

04:22.595 --> 04:24.681
There's nothing sacred about this island.

04:28.226 --> 04:29.394
Saigo.

04:29.811 --> 04:33.648
We should just give the island
to the Americans...

04:33.898 --> 04:35.358
and then we can go home.

04:38.903 --> 04:40.029
Saigo!

04:41.865 --> 04:43.199
What did you say, soldier?

04:44.868 --> 04:48.329
I said if we beat the Americans,
then we can go home.

04:49.497 --> 04:51.624
You there, is that what he said?

04:53.084 --> 04:55.378
Yes, sir.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.295
I'm Kuribayashi.

06:19.504 --> 06:22.173
Welcome, General.
I am Admiral Ohsugi.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.884
How long have you been
waiting here for me?

06:26.010 --> 06:27.387
Three hours, sir.

06:27.554 --> 06:28.888
Sorry to hear that.

06:29.097 --> 06:31.391
They wouldn't allow me
to wire my arrival...

06:31.558 --> 06:33.643
after what happened
to Admiral Yamamoto.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.019
I understand, sir.

06:35.270 --> 06:37.147
This is my aide, Lieutenant Fujita.

06:37.772 --> 06:40.275
What's the matter, Admiral?
You don't look very well.

06:40.483 --> 06:43.820
It's nothing, sir. The water
doesn't agree with me here.

06:43.987 --> 06:45.488
Sorry to hear that.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.657
This way to your quarters.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.535
Admiral, I want to make a round
of the island first.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.787
Shall I fetch a vehicle?

06:52.954 --> 06:54.914
No, let's walk.

06:55.915 --> 06:57.542
Walking is good for the health.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.878
It might be just what you need, Ohsugi.

07:15.810 --> 07:17.562
So that's Suribachi.

07:26.613 --> 07:27.697
You unpatriotic...

07:28.406 --> 07:29.741
no-good peasants!

07:30.200 --> 07:31.451
Hey, stop it!

07:35.205 --> 07:36.289
Stand up!

07:37.290 --> 07:38.666
What are you doing?

07:41.377 --> 07:42.712
These soldiers...

07:45.548 --> 07:47.550
were conspiring
with unpatriotic words, sir.

07:48.593 --> 07:49.719
I see.

07:49.969 --> 07:52.597
And, Captain, do you have
such an excess of soldiers...

07:52.764 --> 07:55.391
that you could put two
of them out of commission?

07:56.309 --> 07:57.519
No, sir.

07:58.436 --> 08:00.063
Then stop beating them.

08:00.438 --> 08:02.732
Deny their lunch rations instead.

08:03.274 --> 08:06.986
A good captain uses his brain,
not just his whip.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.701
What is all this?

08:14.327 --> 08:15.537
All this?

08:15.829 --> 08:17.122
Trenches, sir.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.582
Why are the men digging trenches here?

08:20.125 --> 08:22.961
This is where the Americans
are expected to land.

08:24.796 --> 08:26.548
Have them stop immediately.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.758
But, General...

08:29.384 --> 08:30.593
And, Captain...

08:31.428 --> 08:33.429
make sure these men get proper breaks.

08:33.763 --> 08:36.224
They look like they're from Mars.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.196
Stop digging!

09:07.672 --> 09:09.007
Just as well.

09:10.216 --> 09:13.052
My stomach has been
bothering me anyway.

09:14.262 --> 09:16.473
A toast to General Kuribayashi...

09:18.183 --> 09:19.851
a fine commander.

09:23.855 --> 09:25.523
Better than sake!

09:26.357 --> 09:28.109
I heard he lived in America.

09:29.319 --> 09:31.780
Maybe that's why he
doesn't want us digging trenches.

09:31.946 --> 09:33.656
Maybe he likes Americans.

09:33.907 --> 09:37.494
No, stupid.
He studied the Americans.

09:39.496 --> 09:42.373
So now he knows how to beat them.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.877
I heard from someone in the 204th...

09:46.628 --> 09:51.174
that another general was
supposed to command the island...

09:51.883 --> 09:55.011
but he didn't want the job.

09:56.471 --> 10:00.517
So Premier Tojo gave it
to Kuribayashi instead.

10:01.893 --> 10:05.814
Nozaki, you hear a lot of things...

10:07.232 --> 10:09.401
but your ears are full of wax!

10:11.069 --> 10:15.115
Anyway, you can't trust anyone
from the 204th.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.158
They're part of the Navy.

10:17.492 --> 10:20.495
I think this Kuribayashi
must be a superb general.

10:21.037 --> 10:22.247
Look...

10:22.997 --> 10:28.294
we're not digging those damn trenches
in the sand anymore, are we?

10:44.811 --> 10:47.814
This heat is more than I had anticipated.

10:52.569 --> 10:57.615
This island is bigger than I thought.
I'm exhausted.

11:05.248 --> 11:06.416
Ito, reporting for duty.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.626
Thank you for coming right away.

11:09.878 --> 11:12.505
How much air force
do we have available?

11:12.672 --> 11:15.258
41 Zekes and 13 bombers, sir.

11:15.425 --> 11:16.468
Is that all?

11:16.634 --> 11:20.722
In order to support Saipan,
we lost 66 planes a few days ago.

11:22.015 --> 11:26.352
We will have to rely on support
from the Combined Fleet then.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.315
Is this the current defense plan?

11:36.029 --> 11:38.948
And what about the Army troops?
Where will they be stationed?

11:41.785 --> 11:43.661
I don't know exactly.

11:43.828 --> 11:46.706
They are under independent
command of Colonel Adachi.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.250
You have not coordinated
your plans with the Army?

11:49.417 --> 11:52.170
According to Navy rules,
until the enemy lands...

11:52.337 --> 11:55.256
This is a real war!
You are aware of that, aren't you?

12:01.387 --> 12:02.555
This will not work.

12:02.722 --> 12:05.183
You are concentrating all
your efforts on the beaches.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.812
- Move the artillery to higher ground.
- But, sir, we just had them...

12:08.978 --> 12:10.563
moved down to the beaches.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.190
Well, move them back.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.153
Coordinate with the Army
and have them start immediately.

12:17.320 --> 12:20.407
Fortifications at Suribachi are the priority.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.158
I'm going to walk some more.

12:22.367 --> 12:25.245
- It's pitch black out there, sir.
- I know.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.757
This one is trouble.

12:39.717 --> 12:43.054
Army commanders usually are, sir.

13:25.764 --> 13:27.140
Another letter?

13:27.348 --> 13:30.435
You know that the mail only goes out
when there's a boat available?

13:30.894 --> 13:32.312
I have a lot of family.

13:32.854 --> 13:35.648
Then how come all your letters
are addressed to your wife?

13:37.233 --> 13:38.401
Nosey!

13:38.610 --> 13:40.236
Here, let me do you a favor.

13:40.779 --> 13:43.948
Otherwise, your letters
will never make it through.

13:45.116 --> 13:46.826
Hey, what are you doing?

13:47.243 --> 13:50.705
I used to work at the censorship office
in Tokyo before I was transferred.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.458
You mean demoted.

13:54.417 --> 13:57.962
"To Hanako: We soldiers dig.
We dig all day."

13:58.171 --> 14:00.840
No, no, no. This will never pass.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.427
Give me that back!

14:13.228 --> 14:17.607
There. You'll thank me
for this later, Saigo.

14:21.444 --> 14:22.612
Next!

14:29.119 --> 14:30.370
Good!

14:56.938 --> 14:58.523
Are you blind?

15:00.066 --> 15:01.860
Can't you see the target?

15:03.194 --> 15:06.531
Even my six-year-old could
shoot better than you do.

15:07.782 --> 15:08.908
Do it again!

15:14.956 --> 15:18.460
You're an embarrassment!
You call yourself an Imperial soldier?

15:20.378 --> 15:23.965
Tonight you will clean the boots
of your entire troop.

15:24.132 --> 15:25.216
Go to the rear!

15:27.719 --> 15:31.347
They should learn to clean their guns
properly, rather than their boots.

16:06.925 --> 16:08.760
What are those tanks doing here?

16:09.094 --> 16:13.098
Those are out of commission, sir.
They are waiting for parts.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.934
- For how long?
- About a month, sir.

16:35.787 --> 16:39.165
<i>Taro, America is filled with cars.</i>

16:40.291 --> 16:44.462
<i>I have to be very careful
when I cross the street...</i>

16:45.296 --> 16:47.882
<i>there are so many cars everywhere.</i>

16:48.925 --> 16:52.929
<i>Taro, are you behaving yourself
and listening to your mother?</i>

16:53.680 --> 16:55.306
<i>I miss you.</i>

17:05.358 --> 17:08.611
These civilians need to be
evacuated as soon as possible.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.573
Yes, sir.

18:12.884 --> 18:13.927
<i>Hanako...</i>

18:14.844 --> 18:16.763
<i>we have a celebrity here.</i>

18:17.347 --> 18:20.683
<i>Baron Nishi, the Olympic gold medalist
in horse jumping.</i>

18:22.102 --> 18:24.896
<i>He will lead the 26th tank regiment...</i>

18:25.563 --> 18:28.441
<i>and has just arrived from Tokyo.</i>

18:43.415 --> 18:47.585
<i>Nishi is very handsome, and there are
rumors of his womanizing skills.</i>

18:48.837 --> 18:53.091
<i>But there are no women
left on the island to woo.</i>

19:19.451 --> 19:22.495
Lieutenant Colonel Nishi!
You brought your horse.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.247
From Chichi Jima.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.422
I used to be a cavalryman myself,
you know.

19:32.589 --> 19:34.674
Of course, I know.

19:34.924 --> 19:38.344
I've been looking forward
to serving under you.

19:38.928 --> 19:41.431
One who understands horses
the way I do.

19:41.598 --> 19:45.769
When we used to ride horses
through the battlefield...

19:45.935 --> 19:47.812
those were the good old days...

19:49.230 --> 19:51.274
not like these mechanized contraptions.

19:52.609 --> 19:54.819
I could send for another horse...

19:55.695 --> 19:57.197
and we could ride together.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.032
I'm afraid my riding days are over.

20:00.617 --> 20:05.413
But tell me about this famous horse
of yours that you won the Olympics with.

20:06.289 --> 20:07.624
My stallion, Uranus.

20:19.010 --> 20:22.138
Oh, yes, this horse has a fine back.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.685
I bought him in Italy.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.522
They were happy to get rid of him.

20:30.688 --> 20:33.441
He was such a wild horse.

20:34.442 --> 20:38.738
No one could tame the beast,
but I told them...

20:38.905 --> 20:40.824
such a headstrong horse...

20:41.241 --> 20:44.619
is a perfect match for me.

20:48.998 --> 20:51.668
Come dine with me tonight.
I feel like having a drink.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.087
I think that can be arranged.

21:03.805 --> 21:06.224
How did you manage to get
the Johnnie Walker?

21:06.891 --> 21:08.643
I drank some already.

21:14.983 --> 21:17.777
I'm sorry. This is all we have.

21:17.944 --> 21:20.071
That's fine, as long as we have this.

21:24.367 --> 21:26.202
What is this empty plate?

21:27.370 --> 21:29.372
I have told our cook that all officers...

21:29.539 --> 21:31.875
will have the same rations
and food as our men.

21:32.041 --> 21:35.128
I'm sorry, but serving three dishes
is regulation.

21:36.171 --> 21:39.883
Oh, but of course we have the right to be
served more than three dishes per meal.

21:40.049 --> 21:41.301
You're absolutely right.

21:52.437 --> 21:54.272
When you think about it...

21:54.647 --> 21:58.943
it is regrettable that most of the
Combined Fleet was destroyed.

22:00.528 --> 22:02.280
We still have some battleships left...

22:02.447 --> 22:07.452
but we have very little striking power
from the air or sea.

22:08.578 --> 22:10.080
Nishi, what do you mean?

22:13.416 --> 22:18.046
So you have not heard about
the Mariana battle?

22:19.130 --> 22:24.135
Admiral Ozawa's carrier and boat planes
were destroyed.

22:26.721 --> 22:28.098
The Imperial headquarters...

22:28.765 --> 22:31.643
is deceiving not just the people,
but us as well.

22:32.060 --> 22:34.813
If you want my honest opinion, General...

22:36.523 --> 22:38.441
the best thing to do...

22:39.275 --> 22:43.822
would be to sink the island
to the bottom of the sea.

22:46.282 --> 22:48.159
And yet, you still came?

22:51.329 --> 22:52.414
Well...

22:52.831 --> 22:57.836
I figured your men were going to need
all the tanks that I could bring.

23:46.801 --> 23:48.261
This must be it.

23:48.678 --> 23:50.638
Yes, the enemy must land here.

23:56.102 --> 23:57.187
Run!

23:58.229 --> 23:59.856
Like you were one of the Americans!

24:00.065 --> 24:01.983
Go on! Which direction would you take?

24:30.887 --> 24:32.097
Hey...

24:33.223 --> 24:35.308
I think your general has gone mad.

24:39.270 --> 24:41.022
Look at the gun he has.

24:45.610 --> 24:48.613
He probably took it
from a dead American.

24:49.739 --> 24:51.157
Maybe.

24:59.249 --> 25:00.583
Break time is over.

25:01.292 --> 25:02.544
Back to work!

25:07.215 --> 25:08.925
Are you all right, Kashiwara?

25:09.509 --> 25:11.136
You look pale.

25:12.929 --> 25:15.014
I'm fine. It's just the damn water.

25:15.723 --> 25:19.519
But... I... really... need to go.

25:38.955 --> 25:41.166
There will be a major change
in our strategy.

25:41.833 --> 25:46.588
We will dig caves in the Motoyama,
Higashiyama, and Suribachi-yama areas.

25:47.130 --> 25:51.509
We will build these underground
fortifications, and fight to the end.

25:51.801 --> 25:55.013
- What about the beach defenses, sir?
- Not needed.

25:56.473 --> 26:00.185
But, sir, the beach trenches
are our first line of defense.

26:00.351 --> 26:03.730
Without the beach trenches,
how do you expect us to win?

26:03.897 --> 26:08.902
Hayashi, do you know how many cars
America produces in a year?

26:09.069 --> 26:10.236
Five million.

26:10.695 --> 26:13.782
The Americans' technological
advancements cannot be underestimated.

26:13.948 --> 26:16.743
They will cross the beaches eventually.

26:18.328 --> 26:20.830
If we waste our soldiers there,
there is no hope for victory.

26:20.997 --> 26:22.791
It is inevitable that men will die...

26:23.374 --> 26:26.628
but I never heard of an island operation
without beach fortifications.

26:26.795 --> 26:30.423
General, it will be a futile waste of time
to start digging tunnels now.

26:30.590 --> 26:32.217
We should force the enemy
near the island...

26:32.383 --> 26:34.552
and launch a pincer drive
from the sea and air.

26:34.719 --> 26:37.097
I agree. That makes the most sense.

26:37.305 --> 26:38.389
Ohsugi...

26:39.432 --> 26:41.142
doesn't the Navy know?

26:45.188 --> 26:48.691
The Combined Fleet has been completely
destroyed off the Marianas.

26:48.900 --> 26:50.985
The island is now isolated.

26:56.533 --> 27:00.245
What's more, I received a new order from
the Imperial headquarters this morning.

27:00.620 --> 27:03.039
The remaining fighter planes
are to be sent back...

27:03.206 --> 27:04.833
to Tokyo to defend the mainland.

27:04.999 --> 27:08.044
Outrageous! How are we to fight?

27:11.798 --> 27:15.718
We do not have time for discussion.
We should head back.

27:48.710 --> 27:49.878
<i>Dear Mother...</i>

27:51.504 --> 27:54.758
<i>I have been commissioned
to a new troop today.</i>

27:56.509 --> 28:00.013
<i>I cannot talk about this transfer now.</i>

28:01.514 --> 28:03.308
<i>Take good care of yourself.</i>

28:17.489 --> 28:18.823
Look at this picture.

28:22.077 --> 28:23.787
That's some fancy castle.

28:25.080 --> 28:27.749
You know who this castle was built for?

28:28.583 --> 28:30.376
Someone who was already dead.

28:32.420 --> 28:34.964
They must have had
a lot of money back then...

28:35.465 --> 28:37.592
to build a castle like that
for a dead person.

28:39.219 --> 28:41.429
Why are you reading that book anyway?

28:42.013 --> 28:44.724
We're never going to war over there.

28:45.934 --> 28:48.978
We'll be lucky if we even get
a hole in the ground when we're dead.

28:49.729 --> 28:51.731
Don't talk about that. It's bad luck.

28:57.404 --> 28:59.197
Is this the 312th?

28:59.531 --> 29:00.949
That's right.

29:01.825 --> 29:04.411
I'm Nozaki. This is Saigo.

29:07.038 --> 29:09.749
Shimizu, you can put your bedroll there.

29:14.212 --> 29:16.089
There's an empty space in the back.

29:17.715 --> 29:18.967
Don't mind him.

29:20.218 --> 29:23.680
His friend Kashiwara just died.

29:24.556 --> 29:26.349
That used to be his spot.

29:34.023 --> 29:35.942
But we are all going to die.

29:36.735 --> 29:38.737
That's the plan, isn't it?

29:40.989 --> 29:42.991
For our country, it is an honor.

29:45.285 --> 29:47.579
Kashiwara died of honorable dysentery.

29:49.038 --> 29:51.708
Shimizu, where are you from?

29:54.043 --> 29:55.295
Kanagawa-ken.

29:57.005 --> 29:59.048
Ozawa is from there, aren't you?

30:00.091 --> 30:01.426
That's right.

30:05.388 --> 30:07.015
Where were you trained?

30:07.766 --> 30:10.727
Maybe we were at the same school?

30:11.770 --> 30:12.854
No.

30:13.563 --> 30:15.732
I trained in Tokyo.

30:16.149 --> 30:18.485
I trained in Tokyo, too. Where?

30:25.909 --> 30:28.078
<i>The Koho Kimmu Yoin Yoseijo.</i>

30:39.839 --> 30:41.132
Hey...

30:42.592 --> 30:44.886
<i>why do you think they put
a Kempeitai in our unit?</i>

30:45.053 --> 30:46.429
I don't know.

30:50.767 --> 30:53.937
<i>He's not wearing the white armband.
He's not Kempeitai.</i>

30:55.730 --> 30:57.899
<i>He went to the Kempeitai
military academy.</i>

30:58.983 --> 31:00.944
Maybe he was kicked out.

31:04.656 --> 31:06.825
<i>He acts like a Kempeitai.</i>

31:11.413 --> 31:13.873
Look at his holster.
That's not standard issue.

31:16.042 --> 31:19.379
He's been put here to spy on us.

31:21.131 --> 31:23.633
Why would he spy on us?

31:25.468 --> 31:29.097
Maybe it's those letters
you've been writing.

31:31.433 --> 31:33.017
You should be careful.

31:59.669 --> 32:01.755
Weed soup again?

32:03.840 --> 32:07.343
Kuribayashi is conserving
our food supplies for the battle.

32:08.219 --> 32:11.973
We'll be dead
before the Americans even get here.

32:13.808 --> 32:16.936
And you would think that with all my
war effort contributions...

32:17.187 --> 32:20.774
<i>we should be eating kasutera cakes
or sandwiches.</i>

32:22.192 --> 32:23.359
What?

32:24.110 --> 32:29.365
I ran a bakery in Ohmiya with my wife.

32:29.783 --> 32:31.618
Back when we could still get sugar...

32:33.078 --> 32:37.707
<i>we sold ampan and kasutera cakes.</i>

32:45.590 --> 32:49.511
<i>However, his Kempeitai brethren...</i>

32:50.553 --> 32:52.931
used to come and take
whatever they wanted.

32:56.309 --> 32:58.019
For the war...

32:59.854 --> 33:01.648
For the country...

33:04.109 --> 33:05.693
Why bread?

33:08.863 --> 33:14.160
We ran into those types
at our clothing store as well.

33:16.496 --> 33:18.790
When we started making sandwiches...

33:20.291 --> 33:22.502
they took those, too.

33:24.587 --> 33:28.174
And when we ran out of meat
and just had bread, they still came.

33:33.346 --> 33:37.684
Eventually, they took all of our
baking equipment for the metal...

33:40.353 --> 33:43.481
and we were out of business.

33:47.402 --> 33:49.195
I should have been a fisherman.

33:52.574 --> 33:54.784
It must have been hard on your wife...

33:57.662 --> 34:00.206
without the shop
and without her husband.

34:33.907 --> 34:37.869
Tell them to go away.
We have nothing to sell.

34:43.917 --> 34:47.670
Congratulations! Your husband
is going to war.

35:02.394 --> 35:04.187
Thank you very much.

35:04.854 --> 35:08.691
I'm happy to serve the country.

35:12.779 --> 35:16.282
Prayers for your eternal success at arms.

35:16.866 --> 35:21.329
I beg of you! We have only each other.

35:25.041 --> 35:27.544
This is not the time.

35:29.587 --> 35:34.259
We have all sent our husbands
and sons to war.

35:35.093 --> 35:39.305
We all have to do our part.

35:43.143 --> 35:45.937
At least you'll have a little one
to carry on your name.

35:59.242 --> 36:01.786
I can't eat with you like that.

36:04.789 --> 36:09.085
What am I going to do after you die?

36:15.467 --> 36:17.719
I'm not in the coffin yet.

36:20.513 --> 36:24.267
The men never come home,
not even a soul.

36:27.062 --> 36:28.938
They'll never let you come home.

36:30.982 --> 36:32.400
Don't worry.

36:34.903 --> 36:36.529
And now, with the baby.

37:00.220 --> 37:01.513
Can you hear me?

37:03.264 --> 37:04.557
It's Dad.

37:07.519 --> 37:08.603
Listen.

37:11.564 --> 37:15.276
Don't tell anyone
what I'm telling you now.

37:17.570 --> 37:18.738
It's a secret.

37:33.962 --> 37:35.171
Your dad...

37:39.008 --> 37:41.052
is going to come home for you.

38:37.317 --> 38:38.526
Hurry up!

38:41.946 --> 38:43.490
The enemy approaches!

38:54.209 --> 38:55.585
This is ridiculous!

38:56.169 --> 38:58.463
Why waste time digging these tunnels?

38:59.130 --> 39:01.216
They are all going to die anyway.

39:01.800 --> 39:05.386
At least he conceded
to the pillboxes on the beach.

39:18.316 --> 39:20.026
You wanted to see me, sir?

39:21.194 --> 39:22.737
Care for a drink?

39:28.201 --> 39:30.495
You have been looking
quite pale these days.

39:33.998 --> 39:37.836
It's the water. It has
never agreed with me.

39:38.253 --> 39:39.462
That's not good.

39:41.005 --> 39:44.050
Why don't you go back
to the mainland to recoup?

39:45.635 --> 39:49.806
I have commissioned Admiral Ichimaru
to take your place.

39:51.516 --> 39:53.810
We are wasting time
digging these tunnels.

39:54.519 --> 39:58.648
General, the island won't last
five days without fleet support.

40:00.233 --> 40:02.610
We should fight to the death.

40:04.028 --> 40:08.366
The tunnel-digging may be futile.

40:09.159 --> 40:13.079
Maybe the stand on Iwo will be futile.

40:13.538 --> 40:15.749
Maybe the whole war is futile.

40:15.915 --> 40:17.584
But will you give up then?

40:17.917 --> 40:20.044
We will defend this island
until we are dead!

40:20.211 --> 40:22.464
Until the very last soldier is dead!

40:23.298 --> 40:27.635
If our children can live safely
for one more day...

40:27.886 --> 40:31.014
it would be worth the one more day
that we defend this island!

40:31.931 --> 40:33.141
Ohsugi...

40:33.725 --> 40:37.729
if you have an ounce
of pride left as an officer...

40:38.605 --> 40:39.939
I beg of you...

40:40.565 --> 40:43.693
go back to headquarters
and ask them to send support.

41:08.426 --> 41:12.138
So the rumor is true?
I couldn't believe it.

41:13.556 --> 41:17.394
I'm grateful to be leaving this island.

41:19.145 --> 41:21.147
We may have had our differences...

41:22.315 --> 41:25.193
but I'm truly sorry to see you go.

41:26.694 --> 41:29.864
General Hayashi, it is up to you now.

41:31.449 --> 41:36.329
Kuribayashi belongs behind a desk,
not commanding war.

41:37.080 --> 41:38.456
I understand.

41:38.790 --> 41:42.335
There are many of us
who agree with you, sir.

41:57.392 --> 41:58.435
Listen.

41:58.935 --> 42:02.647
The Americans are likely to land here.

42:04.149 --> 42:06.568
Crossfire positions will be here...

42:07.694 --> 42:08.737
here...

42:09.863 --> 42:11.030
and here.

42:12.449 --> 42:13.742
The fact is...

42:13.908 --> 42:20.206
we are completely
outnumbered in every sector.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.002
But we have a great advantage.

42:25.003 --> 42:27.589
Can anyone tell me what that is?

42:33.178 --> 42:36.181
The Americans are weak-willed
and inferior to Japanese soldiers.

42:36.347 --> 42:37.807
Very good, Shimizu.

42:38.725 --> 42:40.226
Why is that?

42:40.518 --> 42:42.103
They are not as disciplined...

42:42.270 --> 42:44.981
and they let their emotions
interfere with their duty.

42:45.148 --> 42:46.441
That is correct.

42:50.111 --> 42:53.114
Here is the uniform
of an American medic.

42:54.574 --> 42:55.825
He should be your target.

42:56.659 --> 43:00.747
For Americans will risk the lives
of many soldiers to save this one.

43:01.664 --> 43:02.749
Understood?

43:14.302 --> 43:17.222
General, may I speak with you?

43:19.641 --> 43:22.060
Please keep an eye on
Major General Hayashi.

43:24.312 --> 43:26.523
Thank you for your concern, Nishi...

43:26.856 --> 43:29.901
but we don't have any time to waste.

43:30.235 --> 43:33.488
We must think about what
we can do at this moment.

43:36.783 --> 43:38.243
Admiral Ichimaru.

43:41.413 --> 43:43.289
Reporting for duty, sir.

43:44.290 --> 43:45.917
Excuse me.

43:46.334 --> 43:48.920
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

45:47.372 --> 45:48.540
Jupiter!

45:51.376 --> 45:52.669
Jupiter.

46:43.928 --> 46:45.138
Yamazaki...

46:46.181 --> 46:49.309
what are you doing just
sitting there? Help us...

47:29.265 --> 47:32.102
I think he's writing about us
in his reports.

47:33.311 --> 47:34.979
He's just writing a letter.

47:35.480 --> 47:38.358
It's been two months, Nozaki.

47:39.818 --> 47:41.611
He would have reported us by now.

47:41.778 --> 47:43.530
How can you be sure?

47:51.538 --> 47:54.332
Will they ever stop?

47:54.791 --> 47:57.836
Day and night, day and night...

48:00.213 --> 48:02.173
It's driving me crazy!

48:03.007 --> 48:07.387
If the damn Americans
are going to invade...

48:09.264 --> 48:11.224
why don't they hurry up and land?

48:25.905 --> 48:27.198
<i>Tako-Chan...</i>

48:27.532 --> 48:31.536
<i>the four chicks that were born
two months ago have grown so much.</i>

48:31.995 --> 48:36.040
<i>The mother chicken leads them
for food every day...</i>

48:36.541 --> 48:40.712
<i>but they're giving me a hard time, picking
at the vegetable garden I have grown.</i>

48:45.675 --> 48:49.012
The fleet of American ships
has left Saipan.

48:57.437 --> 48:59.105
So they are on their way.

49:00.732 --> 49:02.525
Ready the troops.

49:38.269 --> 49:39.437
Men...

49:40.772 --> 49:43.775
the time has come
to show your true colors.

49:44.734 --> 49:47.070
As a member of the honorable
Imperial Army...

49:47.821 --> 49:50.281
I trust that you will fight with honor.

49:53.535 --> 49:57.497
This island is of utmost importance
to Japan.

49:58.790 --> 50:00.166
<i>Should the island fall...</i>

50:02.460 --> 50:04.129
the enemy...

50:05.046 --> 50:09.134
will use it as their base
to attack our homeland.

50:10.552 --> 50:12.137
For the mainland...

50:13.596 --> 50:15.181
For our homeland...

50:15.724 --> 50:18.143
Until the very last man.

50:19.018 --> 50:22.188
<i>Our duty is to stop the enemy right here.</i>

50:23.606 --> 50:25.066
<i>Not one of you...</i>

50:25.692 --> 50:28.903
is allowed to die until you have killed
10 enemy soldiers.

50:32.949 --> 50:36.286
Do not expect to return home alive.

50:39.080 --> 50:42.917
I will always be in front of you.

50:52.052 --> 50:53.720
Long live the Emperor.

51:37.806 --> 51:41.142
<i>Take care and be well.</i>

51:42.644 --> 51:47.774
<i>I will fight courageously until the end,
in the spirit of Yamato.</i>

51:48.942 --> 51:53.321
<i>My heart will always be with you.</i>

51:54.364 --> 51:55.615
<i>Takeichi.</i>

52:12.006 --> 52:17.387
<i>Every household is assigned a quota
of bag-making for the gunpowder.</i>

52:18.179 --> 52:22.684
<i>I cannot help but get tense when I think
that these will be used in battle.</i>

52:23.518 --> 52:26.521
<i>Taro and Yoko laugh at me for this.</i>

52:27.397 --> 52:30.734
<i>Takako, on evacuation in Nagano,
is also doing well.</i>

52:31.568 --> 52:33.695
<i>I pray for your safety.</i>

52:34.696 --> 52:37.073
<i>Sincerely, Yoshi.</i>

52:51.004 --> 52:52.714
No one can shoot me now.

52:56.718 --> 53:00.930
That's a nice belt.
My wife sent me one, too.

53:05.685 --> 53:09.856
<i>Doesn't look like Mr. Kempeitai
has a thousand-stitch belt, does he?</i>

53:10.231 --> 53:12.734
Maybe he thinks it will clash
with his uniform.

53:12.901 --> 53:15.445
He probably doesn't believe
in superstitions, anyway.

53:20.408 --> 53:22.702
His mother made him one after all.

53:45.809 --> 53:48.978
- Maybe they're trying to sink the island.
- My head hurts.

53:49.229 --> 53:52.232
How many ships do you think
there are out there?

53:52.399 --> 53:56.111
At least 30. Maybe even 50.

53:56.444 --> 53:59.030
- They must be really close.
- I need to take a leak.

53:59.197 --> 54:01.950
Don't go near the sewers.
Dysentery is spreading through there.

54:02.117 --> 54:03.284
Where do I go then?

54:03.618 --> 54:05.620
There is a pot at the end of the cave.

54:25.974 --> 54:27.851
The shit pot is full.

54:28.143 --> 54:30.103
Someone needs to throw it out.

54:53.668 --> 54:56.045
If anything happens to that pot...

54:57.505 --> 55:02.385
you'll be carrying our shit away
with your hands.

56:09.452 --> 56:11.287
Is this some kind of a joke?

56:12.288 --> 56:14.791
Why are you always picking on me?

56:53.747 --> 56:58.209
Thank you, God. I take back
what I said before.

57:12.932 --> 57:14.768
Shall we commence fire?

57:15.143 --> 57:16.227
Not yet.

57:21.357 --> 57:23.943
The men wish to commence firing.

57:31.451 --> 57:32.786
Hold your fire!

57:36.122 --> 57:37.457
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

57:37.791 --> 57:39.125
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

57:47.175 --> 57:50.220
They will take the beach
in no time if we do not resist.

57:50.387 --> 57:52.389
Wait until the beach is full.

58:15.078 --> 58:17.956
Let's go. Commence firing!

58:23.920 --> 58:25.338
Commence firing!

58:26.464 --> 58:27.924
<i>Commence firing!</i>

59:30.028 --> 59:32.072
The guns of the Kitakubo unit
were destroyed.

59:32.238 --> 59:34.574
All the pillbox units on the beach
have been destroyed.

59:34.741 --> 59:36.659
However, all other forces are intact...

59:36.826 --> 59:39.079
and we estimate more than
1,000 enemy casualties.

59:39.579 --> 59:41.998
The pillbox destruction was unavoidable.

59:42.373 --> 59:44.501
Overall, that is good news.

59:44.751 --> 59:46.669
How are the men
holding up at Suribachi?

59:47.754 --> 59:49.130
Forces are intact.

59:52.884 --> 59:54.302
What is the enemy situation?

59:54.469 --> 59:57.472
Approximately 20,000 men and 80 tanks.

59:57.847 --> 01:00:02.102
There has to be more than that.
They still have men waiting in the boats.

01:00:02.310 --> 01:00:04.813
Currently the enemy front extends...

01:00:05.271 --> 01:00:07.982
between Suribachi
and the south landing...

01:00:08.525 --> 01:00:10.777
and Chidori airfield south.

01:00:11.444 --> 01:00:15.657
Just as I thought... Suribachi
and the Motoyama airfield.

01:00:16.616 --> 01:00:18.910
They are making a two-pronged attack.

01:00:34.259 --> 01:00:37.429
That's not enough! I need more ammo.

01:01:02.662 --> 01:01:03.997
Take his place!

01:01:04.414 --> 01:01:06.541
- The machine gun is blasted.
- Use your rifle!

01:01:09.127 --> 01:01:10.670
Watch out! Imbecile!

01:01:11.755 --> 01:01:12.964
I can't rely on you.

01:01:13.131 --> 01:01:16.342
Go send a report to Colonel Adachi
that we need another machine gun.

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.011
Hurry up!

01:01:44.454 --> 01:01:46.706
Colonel Adachi is asking
for reinforcements.

01:01:47.082 --> 01:01:51.377
We can't afford to send reinforcements.
Tell him to hold out.

01:02:02.764 --> 01:02:04.057
Shoot him!

01:02:12.065 --> 01:02:14.401
- What's the matter?
- We're out of bullets!

01:02:33.086 --> 01:02:35.088
We are losing Suribachi.

01:02:35.922 --> 01:02:40.260
All is lost. Request permission
to lead a suicide mission.

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:43.763
No. You must try to hold them off.

01:02:44.514 --> 01:02:48.351
Do what you can to survive
and join forces in the north caves.

01:02:49.144 --> 01:02:50.228
But, sir...

01:02:50.937 --> 01:02:53.857
I have failed to hold Suribachi.

01:02:54.107 --> 01:02:57.026
Permit me to die with honor with
my men.

01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:58.528
No, Colonel.

01:02:59.195 --> 01:03:00.530
<i>This is an order!</i>

01:03:05.952 --> 01:03:07.120
Adachi.

01:03:09.289 --> 01:03:10.457
Adachi!

01:03:23.386 --> 01:03:27.390
Sir, Captain Tanida
requests machine guns.

01:03:29.559 --> 01:03:30.852
It's over.

01:03:38.985 --> 01:03:40.195
Suicide...

01:03:41.571 --> 01:03:43.531
That's the only thing left.

01:03:44.407 --> 01:03:45.450
But...

01:03:46.785 --> 01:03:49.788
Here, take this to your commander.

01:04:34.749 --> 01:04:38.378
I heard General Kuribayashi
order Colonel Adachi to escape.

01:04:38.545 --> 01:04:39.587
Quiet!

01:04:43.133 --> 01:04:46.386
Escape is the coward's way.

01:04:47.554 --> 01:04:48.805
Sit down!

01:05:00.942 --> 01:05:02.026
Men...

01:05:04.904 --> 01:05:05.989
we are...

01:05:08.825 --> 01:05:11.161
honorable soldiers of the Emperor.

01:05:14.873 --> 01:05:16.416
Don't ever forget that.

01:05:20.587 --> 01:05:22.505
The only way left for us...

01:05:24.424 --> 01:05:26.342
is to die with honor.

01:05:30.096 --> 01:05:31.598
This is our fate...

01:05:33.266 --> 01:05:35.602
to find our place at Yasukuni Shrine.

01:05:40.690 --> 01:05:42.358
I'll see you there.

01:06:02.128 --> 01:06:04.130
Soldiers, farewell!

01:07:59.412 --> 01:08:00.497
Stop!

01:08:08.088 --> 01:08:11.674
You should die like an honorable soldier.

01:08:12.550 --> 01:08:14.094
Look, Shimizu...

01:08:16.845 --> 01:08:19.640
we can still join the troops
in the northern caves.

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:23.269
Our orders are to stay here until death.

01:08:23.435 --> 01:08:25.270
I heard General Kuribayashi himself.

01:08:26.398 --> 01:08:28.066
That's what he said...

01:08:29.901 --> 01:08:31.236
over the radio.

01:08:32.694 --> 01:08:33.947
It's true.

01:08:38.118 --> 01:08:40.286
We can die here...

01:08:41.912 --> 01:08:44.457
or we can continue fighting.

01:08:47.877 --> 01:08:50.755
Which would better serve the Emperor?

01:08:53.633 --> 01:08:55.135
Which one?

01:09:17.323 --> 01:09:18.700
Where does this go?

01:09:18.867 --> 01:09:21.161
It will take us closer to Motoyama.

01:09:27.250 --> 01:09:29.085
Do you have orders to move back?

01:09:30.502 --> 01:09:32.464
Where are the rest of your men?

01:09:32.964 --> 01:09:34.299
All dead.

01:09:35.841 --> 01:09:37.719
It's the same with us.

01:09:45.727 --> 01:09:47.979
There should be an outlet
somewhere near here.

01:09:48.188 --> 01:09:49.354
Be quiet!

01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:41.908
So you thought you could blow us up,
or burn us alive, did you?

01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:59.926
- Have we heard from Suribachi?
- No, sir.

01:11:00.093 --> 01:11:01.636
Send a messenger!

01:11:09.644 --> 01:11:13.606
Lieutenant Oiso has ordered us
to rendezvous at the east cave.

01:11:21.781 --> 01:11:24.743
We will make a run for Motoyama.

01:11:25.452 --> 01:11:28.079
There is no cover for two kilometers.

01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:31.458
It will be every man for himself.

01:11:38.131 --> 01:11:39.966
See you on the other side.

01:11:40.633 --> 01:11:44.429
If not on this earth,
then in the next world.

01:11:59.402 --> 01:12:02.072
Don't run with the herd.
That's where the enemy will fire.

01:12:02.238 --> 01:12:03.448
Stay back.

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:05.617
That's cowardice!

01:12:07.577 --> 01:12:11.081
There is no use for a dead soldier.

01:12:41.027 --> 01:12:43.196
Wait until the flare is gone.

01:13:09.305 --> 01:13:11.057
Crawl forward.

01:13:29.534 --> 01:13:31.077
What happened to the messenger?

01:13:31.327 --> 01:13:32.704
He never came back.

01:13:36.708 --> 01:13:38.334
I will go to Adachi myself.

01:13:38.585 --> 01:13:41.713
Motoyama's transmitter
still works, General.

01:13:42.964 --> 01:13:44.841
Why not try there, sir?

01:14:05.945 --> 01:14:07.947
Sir, these men retreated
from Mt. Suribachi.

01:14:15.038 --> 01:14:16.414
What are your names?

01:14:16.706 --> 01:14:19.250
Saigo, from the 312th.

01:14:19.876 --> 01:14:21.419
Shimizu, reporting for duty.

01:14:23.588 --> 01:14:25.590
You escaped from Suribachi?

01:14:32.055 --> 01:14:34.099
How dare you!

01:14:36.017 --> 01:14:38.937
It was your duty
to stay in your position until death.

01:14:41.231 --> 01:14:42.816
You should have died...

01:14:43.733 --> 01:14:46.111
with your fellow troop members.

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:51.157
You are both a disgrace.

01:14:55.286 --> 01:14:56.788
Get on your knees.

01:14:59.416 --> 01:15:02.127
- But, sir...
- I said, get on your knees!

01:15:22.355 --> 01:15:24.774
I don't want you to kill
my soldiers needlessly.

01:15:26.484 --> 01:15:28.069
Put down your sword.

01:15:28.570 --> 01:15:29.904
Put it down!

01:15:36.286 --> 01:15:37.829
What's going on here?

01:15:40.165 --> 01:15:44.377
These men ran from Suribachi.

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:51.718
Lt. Ito, I gave the order that all survivors
retreat to the north caves.

01:15:54.054 --> 01:15:55.722
I am very sorry, General.

01:15:57.974 --> 01:15:59.225
It's just...

01:16:00.518 --> 01:16:01.978
Suribachi...

01:16:04.355 --> 01:16:05.774
has fallen.

01:16:27.087 --> 01:16:28.755
Now that Suribachi has been taken...

01:16:28.922 --> 01:16:31.341
the enemy will maneuver all forces
onto the hillside.

01:16:31.508 --> 01:16:33.510
We must move
our command center north, sir.

01:16:39.891 --> 01:16:41.017
Ito...

01:16:43.186 --> 01:16:45.355
fight for your fallen brethren...

01:16:47.190 --> 01:16:48.900
until the end.

01:17:11.423 --> 01:17:12.882
Get up!

01:17:17.178 --> 01:17:19.222
Major General Hayashi
is leading an attack.

01:17:19.389 --> 01:17:21.015
We are to join him.

01:17:24.561 --> 01:17:26.938
Kuribayashi's orders are
to remain in the caves.

01:17:29.441 --> 01:17:33.737
Lieutenant Ito says Kuribayashi
is a weak American sympathizer.

01:17:43.663 --> 01:17:46.499
We will take back Mt. Suribachi.

01:18:08.605 --> 01:18:10.648
Where is Major General Hayashi?

01:18:13.234 --> 01:18:14.611
We don't know, sir.

01:18:15.236 --> 01:18:16.654
Who is in charge here?

01:18:16.905 --> 01:18:18.782
I'm not sure.

01:18:21.951 --> 01:18:24.287
Stay here until
I determine the plan of action.

01:18:50.063 --> 01:18:51.564
We're dead.

01:18:57.529 --> 01:18:59.656
Pull back!

01:19:00.198 --> 01:19:02.033
We'll get reinforcements.

01:19:34.357 --> 01:19:39.195
Why didn't your regiment join the attack?

01:19:43.241 --> 01:19:44.951
Don't sit here like rats!

01:19:45.827 --> 01:19:49.414
Come out of your caves and fight!

01:19:51.207 --> 01:19:52.792
Where is your commander?

01:19:52.959 --> 01:19:54.836
We haven't received the order to attack.

01:19:58.506 --> 01:20:01.259
Didn't you receive the order
from General Hayashi?

01:20:02.677 --> 01:20:05.764
Kuribayashi countermanded
Hayashi's order.

01:20:06.306 --> 01:20:08.224
There is to be no attack.

01:20:11.895 --> 01:20:14.064
We will take back Suribachi...

01:20:15.023 --> 01:20:16.649
with or without Kuribayashi.

01:20:17.358 --> 01:20:20.570
There are already troops on the attack.
Get your men in order.

01:20:20.737 --> 01:20:23.406
Lieutenant, may I remind you
of your rank!

01:20:23.573 --> 01:20:25.950
Your disrespect for senior officers...

01:20:26.785 --> 01:20:29.579
puts your men at needless risk.

01:20:31.623 --> 01:20:33.625
I suggest you go back to your cave...

01:20:33.792 --> 01:20:37.670
or hand over your men.

01:20:47.889 --> 01:20:49.099
Enough.

01:20:49.516 --> 01:20:51.267
We'll do it ourselves.

01:21:02.362 --> 01:21:03.738
That's against regulations.

01:21:04.072 --> 01:21:07.659
That's the officer who tried to kill us.
He doesn't care.

01:21:39.816 --> 01:21:41.192
I won't go back.

01:21:43.236 --> 01:21:45.447
I've had enough of cave fighting.

01:21:47.657 --> 01:21:50.535
You men are now under
Lieutenant Colonel Nishi's command.

01:22:02.630 --> 01:22:04.507
I will throw myself under an enemy tank.

01:22:08.094 --> 01:22:10.638
I will take out one of their machines.

01:22:39.250 --> 01:22:40.502
Hurry.

01:22:42.879 --> 01:22:44.297
What is the status?

01:22:46.091 --> 01:22:47.842
A thousand men were lost...

01:22:48.009 --> 01:22:49.886
in a night attack along Chidori airfield.

01:22:50.053 --> 01:22:52.847
Why? I have given them strict orders
not to kill themselves.

01:22:53.014 --> 01:22:56.768
It seems that the order to retreat
was not conveyed to all sectors.

01:22:57.644 --> 01:22:58.895
Hayashi.

01:22:59.396 --> 01:23:00.730
Damn you!

01:23:01.815 --> 01:23:03.316
And the American advancement?

01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:07.695
A battalion is headed north and we
are fighting back along the west ridge.

01:23:07.862 --> 01:23:12.117
Good. Once they cross the west ridge,
they will be surrounded on three sides.

01:23:13.535 --> 01:23:14.828
This just arrived.

01:23:14.994 --> 01:23:16.121
Read it.

01:23:21.084 --> 01:23:22.627
From headquarters...

01:23:24.796 --> 01:23:29.467
"We regret that we are unable to send
reinforcements to Iwo at this time.

01:23:30.885 --> 01:23:34.389
We earnestly hope you will
fight honorably...

01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:37.350
and die for your country."

01:25:19.411 --> 01:25:20.537
Bring him in.

01:25:36.302 --> 01:25:37.345
Bring him in.

01:25:47.772 --> 01:25:49.941
Shall I finish him off?

01:25:50.692 --> 01:25:52.694
No. Treat him.

01:25:54.112 --> 01:25:55.363
But, sir...

01:25:55.530 --> 01:25:58.158
Okubo, you would expect the same,
wouldn't you?

01:25:58.324 --> 01:25:59.617
Endo, treat him.

01:26:00.035 --> 01:26:02.829
We are low on morphine as it is.

01:26:04.289 --> 01:26:07.125
Sir, the Americans would not treat
a wounded Japanese soldier.

01:26:07.292 --> 01:26:10.253
Son, have you ever met one?

01:26:11.796 --> 01:26:12.922
Treat him.

01:26:50.418 --> 01:26:52.504
Where are you, American tanks?

01:26:53.588 --> 01:26:55.215
Come and get me!

01:27:10.855 --> 01:27:12.482
How is the prisoner doing?

01:27:12.982 --> 01:27:14.317
He is awake, sir.

01:27:18.279 --> 01:27:21.449
I will question the prisoner
for information.

01:29:07.972 --> 01:29:09.224
Damn.

01:29:11.601 --> 01:29:13.103
I've had enough of this.

01:29:13.812 --> 01:29:15.397
I'm going to surrender.

01:29:20.110 --> 01:29:22.028
Go ahead and arrest me.

01:29:23.279 --> 01:29:27.033
I don't care anymore. That's what
you were put here for, isn't it?

01:29:28.451 --> 01:29:30.912
To report treasonous thoughts.

01:29:35.417 --> 01:29:37.210
I was put here because...

01:29:38.670 --> 01:29:40.797
<i>I was discharged from the Kempeitai.</i>

01:29:44.050 --> 01:29:45.218
Discharged?

01:29:49.848 --> 01:29:53.143
I had only been in service
for five days.

01:29:56.396 --> 01:29:57.480
Shimizu...

01:29:57.647 --> 01:30:00.400
you must always be firm.

01:30:01.526 --> 01:30:05.739
Any mercy and people
will take advantage of you.

01:30:11.244 --> 01:30:12.412
That's unpatriotic.

01:30:12.704 --> 01:30:14.247
Go sort it out, Shimizu.

01:30:26.926 --> 01:30:29.763
You do not have the Imperial flag
properly displayed.

01:30:29.929 --> 01:30:31.181
I'm sorry.

01:30:31.347 --> 01:30:34.851
My husband has gone to war
and I couldn't put it up myself.

01:30:35.018 --> 01:30:37.729
It is unpatriotic
not to have the flag displayed.

01:30:37.896 --> 01:30:40.190
If you help me, I'll put it up now.

01:31:00.710 --> 01:31:02.629
Get that dog to shut up.

01:31:04.214 --> 01:31:05.382
What was that, sir?

01:31:06.549 --> 01:31:10.804
That dog is a nuisance.
It is disruptive of Army communications.

01:31:11.388 --> 01:31:13.431
I am very sorry, sir.

01:31:19.813 --> 01:31:21.898
Shimizu. Dispose of the dog.

01:31:23.233 --> 01:31:26.778
We can't have a dog interfering
with important military commands.

01:31:32.575 --> 01:31:34.202
Take the dog in the back.

01:31:34.536 --> 01:31:35.912
It's only a dog.

01:31:36.121 --> 01:31:38.707
It won't happen again.

01:31:39.165 --> 01:31:40.583
Take it out back.

01:31:41.084 --> 01:31:42.752
Keep the children inside.

01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:45.171
Hurry up.

01:32:33.470 --> 01:32:35.805
Take the dog into the house
and keep him quiet...

01:32:36.473 --> 01:32:37.515
and never let him out.

01:32:49.694 --> 01:32:51.237
It's taken care of, sir.

01:33:29.609 --> 01:33:31.528
Are you trying to make a fool out of me?

01:33:33.363 --> 01:33:38.702
If you can't even shoot a dog,
you'll never be able to handle the Reds.

01:33:40.453 --> 01:33:41.871
You are unpatriotic!

01:33:48.086 --> 01:33:50.463
I was discharged for insubordination...

01:33:51.673 --> 01:33:53.383
and sent here.

01:34:02.183 --> 01:34:03.935
Don't look so glum, Shimizu.

01:34:05.478 --> 01:34:08.106
At least now only the enemy hates you.

01:34:13.236 --> 01:34:14.988
I don't blame the dog.

01:34:40.764 --> 01:34:41.931
<i>Taro...</i>

01:34:42.348 --> 01:34:45.268
<i>tonight I attended my farewell party.</i>

01:34:45.894 --> 01:34:48.438
<i>The wives also attended,
so there was a lot of fuss.</i>

01:34:48.605 --> 01:34:51.524
<i>Greeting all the ladies...</i>

01:34:51.775 --> 01:34:54.903
<i>kept me from enjoying the food.</i>

01:37:39.984 --> 01:37:42.028
Is there any information
of the enemy's plan?

01:37:42.821 --> 01:37:45.031
No, it's just a letter.

01:37:46.908 --> 01:37:48.702
It's from his mother.

01:37:51.162 --> 01:37:52.247
"Sam...

01:37:53.289 --> 01:37:55.625
I have mailed you
a couple of books to read.

01:37:56.251 --> 01:37:57.794
I hope that you like them.

01:37:59.129 --> 01:38:00.171
Yesterday...

01:38:00.922 --> 01:38:05.677
the dogs dug a hole under the fence.

01:38:07.053 --> 01:38:11.307
They ran all over the neighborhood.

01:38:12.392 --> 01:38:14.602
By the time we found them...

01:38:15.812 --> 01:38:20.817
the Harrisons' roosters were terrorized.

01:38:21.609 --> 01:38:24.446
Don't worry about us.

01:38:25.697 --> 01:38:29.784
Just take care of yourself
and come back safely.

01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:33.872
Remember what I said to you...

01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:39.127
always do what is right...

01:38:40.211 --> 01:38:42.422
because it is right.

01:38:43.590 --> 01:38:47.260
I pray for a speedy end to the war...

01:38:47.427 --> 01:38:48.845
and your safe return.

01:38:50.430 --> 01:38:51.765
Love, Mom."

01:39:26.424 --> 01:39:29.052
I'm sorry, sir. There is no more medicine.

01:39:29.219 --> 01:39:32.389
It's all right. I'm useless now.
Go help the others!

01:41:03.730 --> 01:41:05.774
Okubo, come here.

01:41:12.489 --> 01:41:14.240
How are we on ammunition?

01:41:16.326 --> 01:41:18.745
Not good, sir.

01:41:20.288 --> 01:41:22.248
Our mortars have been taken out...

01:41:23.041 --> 01:41:24.918
and we're out of machine gun ammo.

01:41:26.711 --> 01:41:30.048
We have only our rifles.

01:41:32.092 --> 01:41:33.134
Okubo...

01:41:33.301 --> 01:41:37.097
you are now in charge of the men.

01:41:41.851 --> 01:41:43.436
We can no longer hold this area.

01:41:44.187 --> 01:41:47.690
You must guide
the rest of the men north.

01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:53.738
Take whatever food and ammo
we have left.

01:41:54.906 --> 01:41:57.283
What about you, sir?

01:42:00.704 --> 01:42:04.124
I'm tired of sharing this cave
with all of you.

01:42:04.958 --> 01:42:07.502
I'm a one-man show from here on out.

01:42:07.836 --> 01:42:09.587
What are you talking about, sir?

01:42:10.964 --> 01:42:14.259
Your first order of business...

01:42:15.301 --> 01:42:17.053
is to find some water.

01:42:44.039 --> 01:42:45.206
Men...

01:42:46.666 --> 01:42:48.293
do your best.

01:42:49.794 --> 01:42:54.215
Do what is right...

01:42:56.051 --> 01:42:58.303
because it is right.

01:43:00.472 --> 01:43:01.723
Understood?

01:43:09.522 --> 01:43:14.486
I will make sure that they send you
medicine and food.

01:43:16.738 --> 01:43:18.073
It has been a great honor...

01:43:19.491 --> 01:43:20.742
to serve...

01:43:22.035 --> 01:43:23.495
under you.

01:44:02.659 --> 01:44:04.202
Hand me my rifle.

01:44:28.017 --> 01:44:29.894
I'm sorry, Okubo.

01:45:50.016 --> 01:45:53.228
Why am I not getting any reports?
Have we heard from Admiral Ichimaru?

01:45:53.395 --> 01:45:56.147
- No, sir.
- What about Nishi or Hayashi?

01:45:58.608 --> 01:46:01.653
- Send out messengers!
- We have. Many times.

01:46:01.903 --> 01:46:03.613
None of them have come back.

01:46:04.114 --> 01:46:05.907
You can't plan strategy like this!

01:46:17.085 --> 01:46:20.588
I have been thinking about
what Lt. Colonel Nishi said.

01:46:21.339 --> 01:46:22.757
He's right.

01:46:28.012 --> 01:46:30.932
I don't know anything about the enemy.

01:46:31.683 --> 01:46:35.353
I believed that the Americans
were cowards...

01:46:41.484 --> 01:46:43.278
but they weren't.

01:46:48.491 --> 01:46:50.660
I was taught...

01:46:52.328 --> 01:46:54.039
that they were savages...

01:46:55.832 --> 01:46:57.834
but that American soldier...

01:47:05.341 --> 01:47:07.469
his mother's words...

01:47:11.389 --> 01:47:13.516
were the same as my mother's.

01:47:14.726 --> 01:47:18.730
I want to fulfill my duty
for the general...

01:47:19.647 --> 01:47:21.816
and our country...

01:47:23.526 --> 01:47:25.695
but I don't want to die for nothing.

01:47:31.701 --> 01:47:33.036
What do you think?

01:47:45.256 --> 01:47:46.383
You...

01:47:47.675 --> 01:47:50.428
haven't lived enough to realize...

01:47:55.266 --> 01:47:57.727
what you are sacrificing.

01:48:06.069 --> 01:48:08.279
Will you surrender with me?

01:48:29.718 --> 01:48:31.052
Careful.

01:48:34.639 --> 01:48:38.435
They'll notice if we leave together.
You go first.

01:48:39.436 --> 01:48:41.187
I'll make up an excuse.

01:48:41.354 --> 01:48:43.982
After a while, I'll tell them
I'm going to check on you.

01:48:44.149 --> 01:48:46.151
We'll be gone before they even notice.

01:48:49.571 --> 01:48:51.614
Pretend that you have dysentery.

01:48:52.449 --> 01:48:54.659
Give me your dysentery look.

01:49:04.627 --> 01:49:06.296
I guess that'll have to do.

01:49:15.263 --> 01:49:16.806
Where are you going?

01:49:17.140 --> 01:49:18.808
I've got dysentery.

01:49:19.267 --> 01:49:21.186
You're going to surrender, aren't you?

01:49:21.352 --> 01:49:23.480
If you are, take me with you.

01:49:24.105 --> 01:49:26.691
- I've had enough of this war.
- Be quiet!

01:49:35.158 --> 01:49:37.660
Where are you going?

01:49:37.911 --> 01:49:40.372
He said he wasn't feeling well.
It could be dysentery.

01:49:40.538 --> 01:49:41.831
You two! Stop!

01:49:47.587 --> 01:49:48.880
Sir, maybe they got spooked.

01:50:06.189 --> 01:50:08.650
Miura, you're on guard.

01:50:09.317 --> 01:50:11.319
Make sure we have no more deserters.

01:51:37.614 --> 01:51:39.240
What unit were you with?

01:51:42.077 --> 01:51:45.955
Higashiyama 314th.

01:51:55.673 --> 01:51:57.133
Did you hear...

01:51:58.802 --> 01:52:02.430
I heard that they would give you a meal.

01:52:04.432 --> 01:52:05.642
A meal...

01:52:09.813 --> 01:52:11.523
That sounds good.

01:52:16.528 --> 01:52:18.196
I'm from Yokohama, too.

01:52:21.658 --> 01:52:24.953
After this is over, you can come visit me.

01:53:41.237 --> 01:53:42.447
Lieutenant!

01:54:24.114 --> 01:54:25.907
Let this be a lesson to anyone else...

01:54:28.118 --> 01:54:29.786
who wants to surrender.

01:55:42.692 --> 01:55:46.529
We need to get through the crossfire
to reach the north...

01:55:47.405 --> 01:55:49.115
and join our forces at the front.

01:55:55.163 --> 01:55:56.247
Listen.

01:55:57.332 --> 01:55:59.834
We'll head for that cave
and make our way from there.

01:56:03.380 --> 01:56:04.923
Don't waste a bullet!

01:56:06.091 --> 01:56:07.550
Not a single one.

01:56:08.093 --> 01:56:09.677
Don't shoot recklessly.

01:57:10.321 --> 01:57:14.409
These are Nishi's troops
and the survivors from Suribachi.

01:57:18.496 --> 01:57:20.457
Are there no officers?

01:57:24.294 --> 01:57:26.588
You all did a good job making it here.

01:57:27.630 --> 01:57:29.299
Fujita, water for them.

01:57:33.970 --> 01:57:36.848
I'm sorry, sir. There is no more water.

01:57:40.685 --> 01:57:41.811
I'm sorry.

01:57:43.146 --> 01:57:44.481
At least you can rest.

01:57:59.662 --> 01:58:01.289
You look familiar.

01:58:06.503 --> 01:58:08.129
You almost lost your head.

01:58:11.174 --> 01:58:15.220
That was the second time you saved me.

01:58:18.014 --> 01:58:19.474
The first time...

01:58:20.183 --> 01:58:23.812
was the day you landed on the island.

01:58:27.565 --> 01:58:29.526
Of course. I remember.

01:58:31.194 --> 01:58:32.821
Well, everything happens in threes.

01:58:49.504 --> 01:58:50.839
<i>Hanako...</i>

01:58:51.881 --> 01:58:54.259
<i>This letter will probably
never get to you...</i>

01:58:54.968 --> 01:58:56.010
<i>but...</i>

01:58:56.720 --> 01:58:58.930
<i>it comforts me to write.</i>

01:59:00.390 --> 01:59:02.934
<i>For five days, we've been
without water and food.</i>

01:59:04.227 --> 01:59:06.020
<i>To survive...</i>

01:59:07.772 --> 01:59:09.858
<i>we do unspeakable things.</i>

01:59:12.861 --> 01:59:14.696
<i>There is no escape now.</i>

01:59:15.447 --> 01:59:16.614
<i>But...</i>

01:59:17.866 --> 01:59:20.702
<i>my only concern is for you and the baby.</i>

01:59:27.250 --> 01:59:28.793
Dig up some worms.

01:59:47.896 --> 01:59:50.607
<i>The battle is approaching its end...</i>

01:59:51.149 --> 01:59:53.902
<i>and there is no more ammunition,
no more water.</i>

01:59:54.069 --> 01:59:57.572
<i>All the survivors will engage
in a general attack.</i>

01:59:58.907 --> 02:00:02.327
<i>I pray for the victory
and safety of the Empire.</i>

02:00:02.952 --> 02:00:05.080
<i>I bid you farewell.</i>

02:00:06.748 --> 02:00:10.794
<i>For the country,
I could not fulfill all of my duties.</i>

02:00:10.960 --> 02:00:14.923
<i>Now that we have no ammunition,
it is with regret that we must perish.</i>

02:00:21.429 --> 02:00:24.599
You made it all the way from Suribachi?

02:00:27.477 --> 02:00:29.688
That must have been quite a journey.

02:00:35.443 --> 02:00:37.028
You are quite a soldier.

02:00:39.364 --> 02:00:40.782
No, sir.

02:00:41.825 --> 02:00:43.159
I'm just a simple baker.

02:00:43.993 --> 02:00:45.787
You were a baker?

02:00:47.288 --> 02:00:48.331
Any family?

02:00:49.374 --> 02:00:50.667
A wife...

02:00:51.292 --> 02:00:55.839
and a baby girl born
last summer in Ohmiya.

02:00:59.342 --> 02:01:00.969
I haven't met her yet.

02:01:07.225 --> 02:01:08.643
It's strange.

02:01:11.187 --> 02:01:14.733
I promised myself to fight
until death for my family...

02:01:16.651 --> 02:01:20.989
but the thought of my family
makes it difficult to keep that promise.

02:01:44.387 --> 02:01:46.347
A radio transmission from the homeland.

02:02:00.028 --> 02:02:01.488
<i>For General Kuribayashi...</i>

02:02:01.654 --> 02:02:06.034
<i>and his troops, who are fighting bravely
for our country...</i>

02:02:06.201 --> 02:02:08.495
<i>a song will be sung by the children
of Nagano...</i>

02:02:08.661 --> 02:02:10.789
<i>which is Kuribayashi's hometown.</i>

02:02:11.122 --> 02:02:15.251
<i>On the waves of the Pacific</i>

02:02:15.418 --> 02:02:18.713
<i>down south from the Imperial City</i>

02:02:19.255 --> 02:02:23.927
<i>a small lonely island floats</i>

02:02:27.305 --> 02:02:30.934
<i>The fate of our Imperial country</i>

02:02:31.101 --> 02:02:35.772
<i>lies in the hands of this island</i>

02:02:38.608 --> 02:02:41.236
<i>Iwo Jima</i>

02:02:44.781 --> 02:02:48.284
<i>As long as we stand</i>

02:02:48.743 --> 02:02:52.831
<i>we shall feel safe, as the Imperial land</i>

02:02:52.997 --> 02:02:57.669
<i>shall forever be at peace</i>

02:03:00.964 --> 02:03:05.635
<i>We shall fight with pride
and honor at any price</i>

02:03:08.012 --> 02:03:11.599
<i>Our proud island</i>

02:03:12.183 --> 02:03:14.853
<i>Iwo Jima</i>

02:03:37.167 --> 02:03:38.501
Do me a favor.

02:03:40.170 --> 02:03:43.965
Stay here and burn all these documents,
and my military chest.

02:03:45.133 --> 02:03:47.302
Everything happens in threes.

02:04:16.748 --> 02:04:18.792
We will make a general attack.

02:04:19.876 --> 02:04:22.212
Although Japan has lost...

02:04:22.921 --> 02:04:24.798
one day...

02:04:25.673 --> 02:04:27.801
our people will praise your dedication.

02:04:28.927 --> 02:04:32.972
A day will come when they
will weep and pray for your souls.

02:04:35.683 --> 02:04:37.977
Be proud to die for your country.

02:04:45.110 --> 02:04:47.612
I will always be in front of you.

02:07:30.233 --> 02:07:31.484
No more.

02:07:33.653 --> 02:07:34.696
No more.

02:07:42.746 --> 02:07:44.456
Thank you, Fujita.

02:08:16.613 --> 02:08:17.781
This is an order.

02:09:26.224 --> 02:09:27.434
You again.

02:09:30.895 --> 02:09:34.691
I have one more favor to ask of you.

02:09:36.735 --> 02:09:37.944
Bury me...

02:09:39.070 --> 02:09:41.072
so that no one will find me.

02:09:55.628 --> 02:09:56.671
<i>Taro...</i>

02:09:57.047 --> 02:09:58.548
<i>I will be home soon.</i>

02:09:59.799 --> 02:10:01.801
<i>I'm glad to be going back to Japan...</i>

02:10:02.761 --> 02:10:06.181
<i>but I'm a bit sad
to leave my friends behind.</i>

02:10:09.642 --> 02:10:11.227
<i>I drove home...</i>

02:10:12.312 --> 02:10:13.355
<i>but...</i>

02:10:13.772 --> 02:10:16.399
<i>it's lonely driving all by myself.</i>

02:10:28.828 --> 02:10:30.830
Is this still Japanese soil?

02:10:40.340 --> 02:10:42.092
This is still Japan.

02:12:48.468 --> 02:12:49.677
Just put the shovel down.

02:14:02.876 --> 02:14:04.002
Be careful.
