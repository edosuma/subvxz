Bow down to Money Bunny
and get your cash fast.

00:13.800 --> 00:15.818
The LAPD has issued an APB

00:15.820 --> 00:17.640
after four men in monster masks

00:17.660 --> 00:20.562
pulled off a brazen midday
heist at Freeridge Savings.

00:20.645 --> 00:21.813
Security footage shows...

00:21.896 --> 00:23.898
That's less than a mile from here.

00:24.065 --> 00:26.317
Bad news doesn't sell barbecue.

00:26.401 --> 00:27.652
And you're folding wrong.

00:27.819 --> 00:29.988
It's triangles, not rectangles.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.742
Paula! This is Dwayne's, not Hooters.

00:33.825 --> 00:35.910
The only belly we serve is pork.

00:42.959 --> 00:45.211
Staring at your phone isn't
gonna change things.

00:45.295 --> 00:47.172
It's been almost a month and
she hasn't hit you back?

00:47.255 --> 00:49.466
Should I send her something
or go over there?

00:49.770 --> 00:50.800
What would you do?

00:50.842 --> 00:52.552
I'd distract myself.

00:53.136 --> 00:55.221
With work. At my job!

00:55.430 --> 00:56.899
I just miss the sound of her voice.

00:56.900 --> 00:58.516
Are we talking about the same Monse?

00:58.600 --> 01:00.852
I miss her hair. How she sucks...

01:00.935 --> 01:01.978
No, no, no!

01:02.520 --> 01:04.230
Her lips, when she's nervous.

01:08.818 --> 01:10.487
Mario? That's weird.

01:10.650 --> 01:11.740
Hello?

01:11.750 --> 01:14.074
Dude, I... I need your help.
Ruby won't get out of bed.

01:14.157 --> 01:15.637
Oh, he finally got that Tempur-Pedic.

01:16.451 --> 01:18.620
No. No. He's... he's
just in a massive funk.

01:18.870 --> 01:21.372
Yes, but no.

01:21.831 --> 01:23.458
- Did you try tickling him?
- Tickling?

01:23.480 --> 01:24.779
It's too hard to explain.

01:24.780 --> 01:26.311
I know all his spots.
I'll be right over.

01:26.711 --> 01:27.796
Okay. Got to go.

01:27.962 --> 01:29.923
Ruby needs me. You're in
charge while I'm gone.

01:29.980 --> 01:30.990
Be back soon.

01:31.007 --> 01:32.008
I...

01:36.304 --> 01:38.473
- ¿Qué onda, compa?
- What's up, man? How are you?

01:38.556 --> 01:41.392
- Heard the good news. Congrats, Papa.
- Yeah. Thanks, man.

01:41.810 --> 01:42.900
Baby mama cravings?

01:43.186 --> 01:45.355
- No, these are for Ruby.
- We go live now

01:45.430 --> 01:48.959
to Maria Sanchez with an update
on the Freeridge robbery.

01:48.960 --> 01:49.980
Turn it up.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.019
Police have tracked down

01:51.020 --> 01:52.570
a stolen and abandoned vehicle

01:52.654 --> 01:54.072
used by the bank robbers.

01:54.197 --> 01:58.118
The LAPD is asking for the public's
help in identifying the suspects

01:58.368 --> 01:59.828
- who are still...
- So how's Little Man?

02:00.120 --> 02:01.746
Oh, you know, he's been better.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.207
- He's been through it.
- Yeah, man.

02:04.332 --> 02:07.794
Uh, never seen him like this before.
Been monitoring him and...

02:08.710 --> 02:10.080
nothing will get him out of bed.

02:11.714 --> 02:12.714
Nothing?

02:15.927 --> 02:18.096
Mario, I just wanna sleep.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.060
Wakey-wakey, biatch!

You got a lot of furry friends.

02:32.569 --> 02:33.695
They're the twins.

02:34.863 --> 02:35.863
You named them?

02:36.531 --> 02:38.533
No. That's my brother-in...

02:40.076 --> 02:41.077
Doesn't matter.

02:42.954 --> 02:43.954
Get up.

02:44.497 --> 02:47.417
- We're going to a party.
- I'm not in a celebratory mood.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.296
I've lost people, too.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.968
- Then you should know how I feel.
- Yep. So let's go.

02:57.427 --> 02:58.678
A party isn't gonna help.

03:01.598 --> 03:03.725
Don't make me carry you.

03:06.811 --> 03:08.062
Can I come, too?

03:10.190 --> 03:11.190
Please?

03:13.234 --> 03:14.694
Ruby?

03:15.028 --> 03:16.028
He's not here.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.633
Why call in the doctor when there's
no patient? Where'd he go?

03:20.033 --> 03:21.784
Don't know, don't care.

03:22.702 --> 03:25.121
- What's with the ice?
- Ugh! My hands are no good.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.290
- Been almost a month.
- A month!

03:27.916 --> 03:31.377
Do you have pain? Numbness?
Tingling? Radiation?

03:31.586 --> 03:35.173
Could be carpal tunnel, chicken
pox, trigger finger, malaria.

03:35.757 --> 03:36.966
I think it's arthritis.

03:41.763 --> 03:43.056
You know,

03:43.473 --> 03:46.601
you're a real hero for
working through the pain.

03:46.684 --> 03:48.770
No, I'm not working.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.482
- Then what's happening with the money?
- Nothing.

03:52.899 --> 03:55.818
Listen. I'm picking up
what you're putting down.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.737
But you need to hit the track, woman.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.530
I can't jog right now.

03:59.614 --> 04:00.865
Ain't talking jogging.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.742
You need to run those stacks, feel me?

04:02.825 --> 04:03.825
Jamal...

04:04.369 --> 04:06.913
I can't make cream if I can't milk.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.207
We gotta get in urgent care now.

04:09.415 --> 04:10.917
I don't do doctors.

04:12.335 --> 04:13.753
Dammit, woman! Fine!

04:15.213 --> 04:17.048
Then we go to the curandera.

04:18.132 --> 04:19.300
La curandera?

04:20.134 --> 04:21.636
Rosario? No!

04:23.388 --> 04:24.722
That woman is dead to me.

04:27.016 --> 04:28.726
Pick your poison.

04:41.656 --> 04:43.074
How's this supposed to
make me feel better?

04:43.157 --> 04:46.536
- We just got here.
- And I already wanna leave.

04:46.911 --> 04:49.330
- Yo, let's dip. No one's gonna notice.
- No, dude.

04:49.539 --> 04:50.539
Having a good time?

04:51.499 --> 04:54.043
- Honestly...
- The best... time.

04:55.878 --> 04:57.171
- Above.
- Below.

04:57.380 --> 04:58.881
- To the center.
- And inside.

05:01.676 --> 05:02.836
I prefer to sip.

05:05.930 --> 05:09.309
- Dude, relax. We're at a party!
- A Santos party.

05:09.392 --> 05:10.810
It's not like someone's gonna come here

05:10.820 --> 05:12.160
and whack the place up with the truce

05:12.170 --> 05:13.820
and all, all right? So just breathe,

05:13.896 --> 05:16.190
have a drink, or four.
I'm not gonna tell Mom.

05:16.941 --> 05:20.361
Look. Think of today as a rare
chance to hang with your big bro.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.447
All right? 'Cause tonight I got you.

05:22.530 --> 05:23.531
I got you!

05:25.366 --> 05:27.327
Doesn't that look like... Oh, shit!

05:27.618 --> 05:29.787
It's Angelica. Oh, my
God. I can't face her.

05:29.871 --> 05:32.498
I'm... I'm a dropout living
at home. I'm a cliché!

05:32.874 --> 05:35.168
- Am I a cliché?
- Yeah. Kind of.

05:35.460 --> 05:36.836
I gotta hide.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.634
I don't wanna be here.

05:44.469 --> 05:46.095
I don't wanna be here.

06:11.537 --> 06:12.955
You, with the shaved head.

06:13.220 --> 06:14.290
And you...

06:14.624 --> 06:16.042
with the other shaved head.

06:16.125 --> 06:17.377
Come here.

06:17.543 --> 06:20.088
We need to feng shui these things now.

06:20.588 --> 06:22.673
Okay, who brought the apps?

06:23.966 --> 06:25.885
I respect the attempt, but come on.

06:25.968 --> 06:29.347
A chip must support the dip, the
veggies should be served cold,

06:29.430 --> 06:31.830
and the guac is store-bought.
What kind of a Mexican are you?

06:32.475 --> 06:34.936
- Yeah, man!
- This party flow is all wrong, people.

06:35.019 --> 06:36.187
I want stations.

06:36.270 --> 06:38.981
Okay, we need to fix this sitch now.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.114
This is so weird.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.741
I can't believe I let you drag me here!

06:49.117 --> 06:51.327
Higher plane, woman. Higher plane.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.872
Marisol.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.582
Rosario.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.753
I see the years have
not been kind to you.

07:02.213 --> 07:04.966
And gravity is not your friend.

07:05.049 --> 07:07.093
Is your husband still dead?

07:07.176 --> 07:08.428
You still got the herpes?

07:08.511 --> 07:10.263
At least I am getting laid.

07:10.346 --> 07:12.098
Once a skank, always a skank!

07:12.181 --> 07:14.600
- Yeah, well it takes one to know one!
- Excuse me!

07:15.184 --> 07:17.145
Enough slut-shaming!

07:17.930 --> 07:19.699
And not to mention, one in
six people have herpes,

07:19.700 --> 07:21.357
so let's not stigmatize.

07:22.316 --> 07:23.734
How can I help you?

07:24.360 --> 07:26.404
My friend here is having a
problem with her hands.

07:28.364 --> 07:30.241
Too many back alley handies?

07:31.784 --> 07:33.786
You... Ow! Ow!

07:34.912 --> 07:36.122
I don't need this shit!

07:36.480 --> 07:37.620
No.

07:37.707 --> 07:39.709
- Jamal!
- Don't "Jamal" me!

07:40.209 --> 07:41.794
Do you want 35% of nothing?

07:49.594 --> 07:50.678
Ugh.

07:53.431 --> 07:54.474
Do what you have to do.

08:06.527 --> 08:08.362
Hey, uh, what are you doing?

08:08.821 --> 08:11.824
Righting a wrong. I mean, who
uses mismatched plasticware?

08:12.158 --> 08:13.409
Is this a spork?

08:14.420 --> 08:15.450
Useless!

08:15.495 --> 08:18.414
Great. Listen. I was... I was
wrong earlier. I should've...

08:18.581 --> 08:20.124
I should've listened and
respected your feelings.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.460
So if you're still feeling
uncomfortable here,

08:22.543 --> 08:24.378
we should bail. Like... like, now.

08:24.462 --> 08:25.796
Seriously? More sporks?

08:29.175 --> 08:31.552
Hey, uh, you?

08:32.720 --> 08:33.720
Uh.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.477
So... how's Berkeley?

08:39.620 --> 08:40.650
Oh, good.

08:40.811 --> 08:42.522
I mean... I mean great, really great.

08:42.605 --> 08:44.357
Uh, I went hard the first semester.

08:44.649 --> 08:47.568
I landed an internship and
I, uh, I got a girlfriend.

08:47.777 --> 08:50.071
Um, she's white. That
goes without saying.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.949
So I guess I am a man of my word.

08:53.407 --> 08:56.661
Uh, yeah, and she's rich, like,
generational wealth rich.

08:56.744 --> 08:58.204
Like 401k and all that stuff.

08:58.746 --> 09:00.873
Yeah, and they have a boat,
so I'm learning how to sail.

09:00.957 --> 09:03.376
So, when in Rome, right?

09:03.459 --> 09:07.088
Except we're gonna be in
the Hamptons this summer.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.440
Summering.

09:08.714 --> 09:11.342
Uh... Yeah, I just
wanted you to know that.

09:12.176 --> 09:13.469
Yeah, so, um...

09:14.554 --> 09:15.914
Well, it was great talking to you.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.272
It's all about...

09:25.690 --> 09:26.857
north to south.

09:27.608 --> 09:28.693
Not east to west.

09:29.026 --> 09:30.236
Get more juice that way.

09:49.922 --> 09:51.549
Enjoy the party.

09:58.973 --> 10:00.391
And Ruben's back!

10:00.730 --> 10:04.540
_

10:06.000 --> 10:07.850
_

10:07.900 --> 10:09.860
_

10:11.319 --> 10:12.820
Don't send it.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.364
I'm not sending anything.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.326
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- She's ghosting you.

10:18.409 --> 10:19.910
She's not like that.

10:19.994 --> 10:21.037
Sure seems that way.

10:21.537 --> 10:23.080
I know it seems that way,

10:23.539 --> 10:24.582
but she's...

10:26.375 --> 10:28.169
She's ghosting me.

10:28.990 --> 10:30.110
I deserve it.

10:30.171 --> 10:31.714
You blow her off for your friends?

10:31.797 --> 10:33.382
- No.
- You step out?

10:33.466 --> 10:34.508
No.

10:34.592 --> 10:35.801
Then what's her problem?

10:36.552 --> 10:37.803
I gave her an ultimatum.

10:38.200 --> 10:39.300
An ultimatum?

10:39.347 --> 10:41.474
I asked her to choose me or her mom.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.560
You're cute, but you're dumb.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.938
Don't get too close!

10:48.105 --> 10:50.274
This is gonna work, right? I
need her back on the street,

10:50.358 --> 10:51.358
like yesterday.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.779
- What is that?
- Birch water and hummingbird blood.

10:55.112 --> 10:56.739
- Hummingbird?
- Uh-huh.

10:56.947 --> 10:58.032
Why not a crow?

10:58.449 --> 11:01.369
Or an eagle, or an emu, something
to kick this into a higher gear?

11:01.452 --> 11:03.996
Who has been doing this for 32 years?

11:15.580 --> 11:16.920
How about this?

11:17.009 --> 11:18.761
It smells nasty as hell,
it's gotta be potent...

11:18.844 --> 11:19.929
That is my lunch!

11:27.978 --> 11:28.978
Ugh.

11:31.148 --> 11:32.358
Uh-huh.

11:34.985 --> 11:36.404
Open your hands.

11:38.447 --> 11:39.699
Stop messing with me!

11:39.782 --> 11:40.942
Open your hands!

11:42.159 --> 11:45.955
- Ow! Ow!
- Whoa! Whoa!

11:47.873 --> 11:49.542
This is going to require...

11:49.875 --> 11:53.087
something more, something that will use

11:53.170 --> 11:56.090
all of my knowledge and skills.

11:56.924 --> 12:00.302
And... for another hundred dollars.

12:01.220 --> 12:03.973
- Something wrong?
- Yeah! We don't appreciate the upsell!

12:04.390 --> 12:06.600
Urgent care is right down the street!

12:06.684 --> 12:07.727
No doctors!

12:16.694 --> 12:17.694
Drink.

12:22.992 --> 12:23.992
I can't do this.

12:24.452 --> 12:25.536
The hell you won't.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.919
Drink! Drink! Drink!

12:34.003 --> 12:36.005
Drink! Drink! Drink!

12:41.719 --> 12:43.721
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

12:44.180 --> 12:45.180
Hey!

12:45.723 --> 12:48.017
The king's gotta go drain
his royal scepter,

12:48.100 --> 12:50.644
but he'll be back to defend his crown.

12:51.687 --> 12:52.897
Yeah!

13:00.900 --> 13:02.320
Call me the new Lil' Ricky

13:02.340 --> 13:04.492
'cause RollerWorld ain't
got nothing on us.

13:05.659 --> 13:06.660
Oh, my bad.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.245
I'm just looking to pee.

13:10.800 --> 13:11.950
Hold up.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.480
You didn't have a place to stay,

13:13.500 --> 13:14.710
you told her how much you needed her,

13:14.730 --> 13:16.045
and she still walked away?

13:16.128 --> 13:18.464
Even after all those years
of knowing each other?

13:20.007 --> 13:21.926
You're being way too hard on yourself.

13:22.218 --> 13:24.136
I'm sorry, but you're
not the bad guy here.

13:24.386 --> 13:25.386
Look at me.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.264
You were honest.

13:27.556 --> 13:28.682
That's the hard part.

13:29.809 --> 13:30.809
She bounced.

13:31.769 --> 13:32.853
That's the easy part.

13:33.729 --> 13:36.106
Yeah. I didn't think of it that way.

13:36.440 --> 13:37.440
Let me see her.

13:43.370 --> 13:44.450
She's pretty.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.367
Understatement.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.035
Who's the guy with her?

13:48.118 --> 13:50.371
Jamal. Or Ruby.

13:51.038 --> 13:52.038
It's not Jamal.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.959
And this guy doesn't look like a Ruby.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.547
You're doing lots of
worrying about someone

13:59.630 --> 14:01.882
who's obviously not worrying about you.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.718
Ruby! Ruby!

14:04.802 --> 14:06.554
Ruby! Ruby!

14:06.637 --> 14:08.389
What up, everybody?

14:08.472 --> 14:09.890
Yeah!

14:10.599 --> 14:12.726
I wanna give a big shout-out to Spooky.

14:12.810 --> 14:15.145
Spooky! Spooky! Spooky!

14:15.229 --> 14:16.229
Yo!

14:16.814 --> 14:18.315
I didn't wanna come tonight.

14:19.316 --> 14:20.693
But Spooky made me come.

14:20.901 --> 14:22.069
Whoa!

14:23.404 --> 14:26.907
And now I feel great! Like a new man.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.242
- Right.
- Thank you, Spooky.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.454
Oh! I also wanna give a shout-out
to my big brother, Mario.

14:33.956 --> 14:35.916
- I love you!
- I love you!

14:36.458 --> 14:39.378
And thank you for making me an uncle
in the next couple of months!

14:39.628 --> 14:40.754
Whoo!

14:41.046 --> 14:42.298
You're gonna have a baby?

14:42.923 --> 14:44.258
Yeah, I'm gonna be a dad.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.803
- Oh!
- Damn!

14:47.887 --> 14:48.971
Oh, uh...

14:49.430 --> 14:50.723
Anyways,

14:51.348 --> 14:53.851
uh, I've been in a really dark place.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.604
But tonight, yo, you guys,

14:56.770 --> 14:58.105
you've shown me the light.

14:58.522 --> 15:00.149
And I wanna give something back.

15:00.858 --> 15:03.068
DJ! Spin that shit!

15:03.569 --> 15:05.029
- Yeah.

Prophets suck! Prophets suck!

15:46.904 --> 15:49.323
- Prophets suck! Prophets suck!
- Hey, hey.

15:49.406 --> 15:52.284
Yo, check it out! Let's go roll
up on these punk-ass fools!

15:52.368 --> 15:54.370
Yeah!

15:54.578 --> 15:56.872
Hold up! Uh, hold up. Wait!

15:59.124 --> 16:00.124
Yo.

16:00.918 --> 16:02.628
What the hell just happened?

16:03.712 --> 16:05.756
- I don't think the truce just ended.
- What?

16:07.466 --> 16:08.467
Wait, what? Oh.

16:10.344 --> 16:12.513
- Let's go, dude.
- We gotta... we gotta go.

16:19.395 --> 16:21.897
Now show me your hands.

16:25.109 --> 16:26.318
This cannot be!

16:26.402 --> 16:29.154
In all my years, this
has never happened.

16:29.697 --> 16:31.573
- Unless...
- Unless what?

16:31.907 --> 16:32.992
- Nothing.
- Nah...

16:33.200 --> 16:35.661
D... Don't tease! Nobody likes a tease!

16:37.560 --> 16:40.640
There is something you
have come in contact with

16:40.660 --> 16:42.459
that is very, very bad.

16:43.043 --> 16:47.464
Are you saying we have a bigger
problem on our hands than her hands?

16:48.632 --> 16:51.427
Is there something hidden in your house?

16:53.262 --> 16:55.973
Something that does not belong there?

16:57.182 --> 16:58.684
- Well...
- Nothing!

16:58.767 --> 17:01.050
We, she touched nothing! Nothing new,

17:01.060 --> 17:03.100
nothing old. Isn't that right, Abuelita?

17:03.355 --> 17:05.482
Whatever that nothing is,

17:05.566 --> 17:07.067
it is something!

17:07.651 --> 17:10.237
And that something in your house...

17:11.070 --> 17:13.156
does not belong there.

17:15.701 --> 17:16.952
It is cursed.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.996
Oh!

17:21.498 --> 17:22.708
Sorry, Rosario,

17:22.958 --> 17:26.045
but you are getting a very
harshly-worded Yelp review!

17:26.336 --> 17:27.921
We came here looking for a cure

17:28.088 --> 17:30.299
and you upsold us on a bag of...

17:31.050 --> 17:32.801
- a bag of dicks!
- What?

17:33.093 --> 17:35.471
I didn't even use my bag of dicks!

17:35.971 --> 17:37.806
Oh.

17:39.433 --> 17:40.434
That's my 11:30.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.811
I'm gonna notarize a court petition.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.105
Don't... move!

17:50.110 --> 17:51.945
We're out of here. This is bullshit.

17:52.237 --> 17:53.237
Or is it?

17:54.400 --> 17:55.491
Think about it.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.826
Those guys who stole the
RollerWorld money...

17:58.786 --> 18:01.830
Frankie, Benito, Lil' Ricky, all dead.

18:02.740 --> 18:04.400
And then you find the money,

18:04.420 --> 18:06.043
and look what happened
to Ruby and Olivia.

18:06.126 --> 18:07.836
And now you give it to me and look!

18:07.920 --> 18:09.588
She's making shit up!

18:10.089 --> 18:12.091
- Nothing's happened to me.
- Not yet!

18:12.370 --> 18:13.467
Look.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.260
Rosario is a slut,

18:15.511 --> 18:18.472
and yes, I still hate her for
selling me bad weed in '83,

18:18.680 --> 18:22.184
but she comes from a
long line of curanderas.

18:23.018 --> 18:25.979
Curanderas who see things...

18:26.814 --> 18:28.023
that we can't see.

18:30.025 --> 18:32.528
Who knew you had skills on the mic?

18:32.611 --> 18:34.488
Some things can't be denied.

18:38.700 --> 18:39.700
Thank you.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.496
I had a really good time tonight.

18:49.711 --> 18:52.464
You know when Mom called that
night from the hospital?

18:53.632 --> 18:56.385
I felt this cold, sick
feeling throughout my body.

18:57.427 --> 18:59.888
And it wasn't just
because you almost died.

19:01.098 --> 19:03.818
But at that moment, I thought of how
shitty I treated you growing up.

19:05.060 --> 19:08.522
How I hated when Mom would
buy us matching shirts or...

19:09.231 --> 19:12.651
how annoyed I was when you'd tag
along with me and my friends and...

19:14.361 --> 19:16.446
how you always liked the
same music I liked.

19:16.697 --> 19:18.198
I just wanted to be like you.

19:18.282 --> 19:19.282
Don't.

19:20.325 --> 19:21.325
Be better.

19:25.914 --> 19:27.207
I'm sorry for being shitty.

19:29.668 --> 19:34.047
I didn't know how awesome my
brother was then, but... I do now.

19:36.216 --> 19:37.467
Can I tell you something?

19:40.095 --> 19:41.763
This is pretty comfy!

19:42.472 --> 19:43.472
Told you.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.268
And if either of us sports
wood in their sleep,

19:46.643 --> 19:47.978
the other will never know.

19:49.771 --> 19:52.566
Um, please don't stain
my maternity pillow.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.528
You think they're together?

19:58.322 --> 19:59.322
I think...

19:59.907 --> 20:01.700
you don't wanna know what I think.

20:02.701 --> 20:05.829
Look, the best thing you can do
is just take your mind off her.

20:08.290 --> 20:09.917
Well, my shift's up, so...

20:10.709 --> 20:12.836
I'm gonna go, unless...

20:13.545 --> 20:15.214
you wanna put in some overtime?

20:30.103 --> 20:32.356
Think about it! It all makes sense.

20:32.439 --> 20:35.025
The night I found the money,
Ruby and Olivia got shot.

20:35.192 --> 20:36.610
Then, I get busted by coach,

20:36.735 --> 20:39.154
and now, Abuelita's fingers are
all Freaky Friday and I can't...

20:39.170 --> 20:40.220
Jamal!

20:40.364 --> 20:42.115
There's no curse. Let it go.

20:42.449 --> 20:44.034
Just go to sleep.

20:44.952 --> 20:45.952
Okay.

20:46.660 --> 20:47.745
You're right.

20:53.377 --> 20:56.129
- But what if...
- You're not cursed! I'm not cursed.

20:56.213 --> 20:58.966
Curses are just justifications
for people's bad choices.

20:59.049 --> 21:01.426
You didn't do anything
wrong. And neither did I.

21:01.510 --> 21:04.263
If I was cursed, I'd feel
guilty about things with Monse.

21:04.429 --> 21:05.764
But I don't, so good night.
