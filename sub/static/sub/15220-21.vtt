00:25.201 --> 00:28.163
Theorizing that one could time travel
within his own lifetime,

00:28.413 --> 00:31.875
Dr Sam Beckett stepped into
the Quantum Leap accelerator...

00:32.375 --> 00:34.419
and vanished.

00:39.049 --> 00:41.509
He awoke to find himself
trapped in the past,

00:42.135 --> 00:44.554
facing mirror images
that were not his own,

00:44.971 --> 00:49.017
and driven by an unknown force
to change history for the better.

00:50.310 --> 00:52.437
His only guide on this journey is Al,

00:52.437 --> 00:54.439
an observer from his own time,

00:54.731 --> 00:57.025
who appears in the form of a hologram

00:57.025 --> 00:59.068
that only Sam can see and hear.

00:59.778 --> 01:03.573
And so Dr Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,

01:03.990 --> 01:07.243
striving to put right
what once went wrong,

01:07.243 --> 01:09.579
and hoping each time
that his next leap...

01:10.288 --> 01:12.332
will be the leap home.

01:16.878 --> 01:18.922
(PUBLIC WARNING SIREN)

01:22.509 --> 01:23.760
Eddie!

01:23.760 --> 01:25.804
Come on, man. Duck and cover.

01:26.513 --> 01:28.640
Get down!

01:28.640 --> 01:30.016
Put your mask on.

01:30.016 --> 01:33.061
Why? The Ruskies just lobbed a bomb
on New York City.

01:33.061 --> 01:35.104
Come on.

01:35.104 --> 01:37.023
It's World War Three!

01:37.023 --> 01:39.067
Get down. Pipe down.

01:40.193 --> 01:42.237
Come on now.

02:57.603 --> 03:03.484
Quantum leaping around, I'm used
to getting my atoms smashed in an
explosion of blinding white light.

03:03.484 --> 03:06.112
But not even that could prepare
me...for this.

03:08.865 --> 03:14.162
RADIO: This has been a test of the
CONELRAD Emergency Broadcast System.
This was only a test.

03:14.162 --> 03:16.289
Only a test?

03:16.289 --> 03:18.082
Come on up, Uncle Eddie.

03:18.082 --> 03:19.542
You OK, buddy?

03:19.542 --> 03:21.586
Yeah, I guess.

03:21.586 --> 03:23.629
Come on, Sam.

03:24.130 --> 03:24.964
What?

03:24.964 --> 03:27.091
Come out now.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

03:28.176 --> 03:30.219
Well, I uh...

03:32.388 --> 03:34.432
That's my boy. Sam!

03:35.224 --> 03:37.268
Come here, Sam. Come on.

03:38.186 --> 03:39.645
Did we do OK, Dad?

03:39.645 --> 03:43.649
You did real good, son. If those
Ruskies attack, we're ready for 'em.

03:43.649 --> 03:46.402
Maybe we should all go out and get
some fresh air.

03:46.402 --> 03:48.529
That's exactly what we're gonna do.

03:48.529 --> 03:50.615
Come on, kids. Up, up, up. Let's go.

03:53.993 --> 03:56.037
Eddie, come on.

04:07.006 --> 04:08.466
(PLANE OVERHEAD)

04:08.466 --> 04:10.510
Enemy aircraft at 12 o'clock!

04:13.971 --> 04:15.515
Wait for me, you pig.

04:15.515 --> 04:17.767
Or I'll turn you into a frog.
Come on, Sam.

04:19.726 --> 04:23.689
I just hate putting them through
these drills over and over,
every day.

04:24.065 --> 04:25.525
Why's that, honey?

04:25.525 --> 04:28.402
Mac, I don't know why you have
to scare 'em like that.

04:28.611 --> 04:30.780
Hey, it's better they know
the truth.

04:30.780 --> 04:34.700
We may all have to stay down there a
week or two till the fallout clears.

04:35.076 --> 04:36.786
Fallout?

04:36.786 --> 04:39.288
Don't worry, Eddie.
You'll be protected,

04:39.288 --> 04:42.166
along with all the other folks
smart enough to buy

04:42.166 --> 04:45.419
an Ellroy Super Deluxe shelter
from us.

04:46.212 --> 04:49.549
See, one thing you gotta remember
when you're selling...

04:49.549 --> 04:50.883
Bomb shelters?

04:50.883 --> 04:52.969
Yeah. Yeah.

04:52.969 --> 04:55.096
You're selling the best.

04:55.096 --> 04:57.139
The best.

04:57.765 --> 04:59.684
Hey, there's Burt the turtle.

04:59.684 --> 05:01.269
Burt the turtle?

05:01.269 --> 05:03.312
Yeah, some nickname my kids
gave him.

05:03.980 --> 05:07.024
His wife left him for the pool man
a couple of years ago.

05:08.025 --> 05:10.236
Hey, Burt! You having a party?

05:10.987 --> 05:13.239
Khrushchev said he might be
dropping in.

05:13.739 --> 05:15.783
Khrushchev. Come on.

05:16.492 --> 05:19.996
Hey, Burt. Come on over. I want you
to meet my kid brother Eddie.

05:20.955 --> 05:22.623
Eddie's in college.

05:22.623 --> 05:25.418
First one in our family.
Oklahoma State.

05:25.960 --> 05:29.046
He's taking time off to make money
selling shelters.

05:29.046 --> 05:31.799
How are you doing?
OK, Burt.

05:31.799 --> 05:34.302
I guess this crisis isn't hurting
you guys.

05:34.302 --> 05:36.262
Well, we can't complain.

05:36.262 --> 05:40.016
I heard the navy is gonna hit the
Soviet missile ships in 23 hours.

05:40.016 --> 05:41.601
You know what that means?

05:41.601 --> 05:43.436
The Cuban Missile Crisis.

05:43.436 --> 05:45.354
What?
What?

05:45.354 --> 05:48.190
The...Cuban Missile Crisis.

05:48.190 --> 05:51.652
I'm just saying, you know,
it'll probably be over any day now.

05:52.153 --> 05:53.821
Of course, you never know -

05:53.821 --> 05:58.492
You never do. That's what I've
been trying to tell Burt for
years, but he had to get -

05:58.492 --> 06:00.286
The pool was for when I sell.

06:00.286 --> 06:02.538
Sell what? There'll be nothing left.

06:02.538 --> 06:06.625
You'll be swimming in fallout while
we're safe below in our Super
Deluxe.

06:07.585 --> 06:10.880
I told you, Homestead is only
200 miles away from Havana.

06:10.880 --> 06:13.466
Hell, they could lob one in here
in 40 seconds.

06:14.508 --> 06:16.594
You really think these things work?

06:17.470 --> 06:18.888
Yeah. Sure. I mean -

06:18.888 --> 06:20.931
They're guaranteed.

06:22.433 --> 06:24.643
Would you mind giving me
a quick look?

06:24.643 --> 06:28.647
Hey, no problem. Eddie here will
give you the special VIP tour,
right?

06:28.647 --> 06:32.026
Oh, hey, wait a minute. I think I
need a little more time to -

06:32.026 --> 06:34.695
Come on. You gotta do this.
Time is running out.

06:38.908 --> 06:42.745
Welcome to the Ellroy Super Deluxe
atom bomb shelter.

06:44.455 --> 06:47.333
Designed to give you the most modern
space age conv-

06:47.792 --> 06:53.839
space age conveniences to protect
you and yours well into the '60s.

06:54.548 --> 06:59.345
Uh...each shelter comes standard

06:59.345 --> 07:02.973
with two plush bedrooms

07:02.973 --> 07:05.142
for your sleeping pleasure.

07:05.142 --> 07:09.105
See, this is one, and then this,
hopefully, will be two.

07:09.522 --> 07:11.607
Here.
Oh, ah...yes,

07:11.607 --> 07:14.318
The chemical toilet in four models.

07:14.318 --> 07:16.529
Yes, and this is the other bedroom.

07:16.529 --> 07:22.034
Now, since you're on your own, Burt,
you could make this into a lovely
rumpus room

07:22.034 --> 07:27.248
for billiards or pinball or just
about anything to keep you amused
while the fallout clears.

07:29.834 --> 07:35.923
And...and...and each shelter comes
equipped with a second standard
emergency exit.

07:35.923 --> 07:41.345
That's if the main hatch is covered
up with dirt and debris after the
blast, you can still get out.

07:41.512 --> 07:42.847
Come on.

07:42.847 --> 07:44.431
Oh, watch your head there.

07:44.431 --> 07:46.433
Oh, man.

07:46.433 --> 07:51.272
Comes supplied with all the supplies
and equipment you'll need to survive
in style.

07:51.272 --> 07:53.399
Here.
Survive in style?

07:53.399 --> 07:55.943
Here. Your battery, portable,
three-way...

07:57.111 --> 08:02.408
radio there is pre-set to both
CONELRAD channels to keep you
informed on your fallout info.

08:02.408 --> 08:06.996
You got your Geiger counter
to tell you how contaminated you are
after the blast,

08:06.996 --> 08:09.164
and - oh, Burt, look at this.

08:09.164 --> 08:13.836
Your own protective radiation-proof
poncho.

08:13.836 --> 08:16.755
Ah. It's got shredded lead
on the inside,

08:16.755 --> 08:18.883
makes it resistant
to plutonic waste.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.512
Handsome, huh?

08:23.512 --> 08:25.014
It's you.

08:25.014 --> 08:26.515
Thank you.

08:26.515 --> 08:27.766
Mm.

08:27.766 --> 08:29.810
Now, give him the big fashion.

08:31.895 --> 08:37.610
Each shelter is decorated
with plush carpeting

08:37.610 --> 08:39.653
and a special coat of paint.

08:40.486 --> 08:43.907
So that, with the Ellroy Super
Deluxe,

08:43.907 --> 08:46.827
there's no reason to sit in a drab
shelter,

08:46.827 --> 08:50.080
when you can -
Survive in style!

08:51.165 --> 08:54.418
Now, normally, this would go for
3Gs,

08:54.418 --> 08:56.587
but since you're a neighbour
and all,

08:56.587 --> 08:58.672
I'm gonna give you a 20% VIP
discount.

08:59.548 --> 09:01.759
20%. $2,400?

09:01.759 --> 09:07.139
Oh, no. I don't know. This whole
Cuba thing could just be a scare.
What if it's over in a few days?

09:07.139 --> 09:09.266
What if it's not?

09:09.266 --> 09:11.685
Now, I got ten crews working
overtime, bud.

09:12.394 --> 09:15.606
I can bulldoze tomorrow, have your
ground up by Monday,

09:15.606 --> 09:18.150
have the whole damn thing set up
by Wednesday.

09:18.567 --> 09:23.322
And that'll be before we intercept
those Ruskie cargo ships loaded with
missiles.

09:23.322 --> 09:25.407
I have to think about it.

09:25.824 --> 09:28.702
You know, the longer you wait
on this...

09:28.702 --> 09:30.746
the longer it takes us to build.

09:33.415 --> 09:35.459
I...I gotta go put my milk away.

09:38.253 --> 09:40.506
Two years, I still haven't sold
to him.

09:40.506 --> 09:42.758
You'd better bone up
on that brochure.

09:42.758 --> 09:45.552
I'm gonna need someone out there
selling for me.

09:45.552 --> 09:47.971
This whole crisis could go on
for weeks. OK.

09:49.681 --> 09:51.767
See you topside.
Yeah. Yeah. See you.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.770
See you topside.

10:04.154 --> 10:05.864
Look at this place.

10:05.864 --> 10:09.368
I can't believe people actually
used to build these shelters.

10:10.202 --> 10:12.246
What's wrong with this picture?

10:16.458 --> 10:18.001
That's better.

10:18.001 --> 10:21.088
Al, I'm an atom bomb shelter
salesman.

10:21.755 --> 10:25.425
Well, actually, you're a junior
at Oklahoma State.

10:25.425 --> 10:27.344
Eddie Ellroy?

10:27.344 --> 10:32.307
Yeah. Apparently, you lost your
basketball scholarship when you
wrecked your knee -

10:32.307 --> 10:36.311
Mac said I'm here selling bomb
shelters to make money to finish
school.

10:36.812 --> 10:40.065
Well, you know, that's a good
business to go into.

10:40.065 --> 10:43.402
October 26th, 1962 is right
at the height of the -

10:43.402 --> 10:45.445
Cuban Missile Crisis. I know.

10:45.988 --> 10:47.239
That's right.

10:47.239 --> 10:49.366
Look at this place.

10:49.366 --> 10:51.410
You got gas masks.
Look at this thing.

10:52.452 --> 10:53.954
It's a radiation chart.

10:53.954 --> 10:56.206
They got atomic rumpus rooms,

10:56.206 --> 10:58.292
but there's no nuclear war.

10:59.751 --> 11:03.046
Yeah, but people didn't know that
then.

11:03.046 --> 11:05.757
We all thought maybe it was
the end of the world.

11:05.757 --> 11:06.925
We?

11:06.925 --> 11:11.847
You're a Swiss cheeser,
too young to remember what
the Cuban Missile Crisis was like.

11:11.847 --> 11:14.641
Elk Ridge, Indiana,
wasn't exactly ground zero.

11:15.517 --> 11:17.644
I can barely remember what happened.

11:18.186 --> 11:20.314
Except for my mom,

11:20.314 --> 11:22.357
cos she was canning food like crazy.

11:23.483 --> 11:27.487
But we didn't live near a big city,
so, you know, it didn't seem so
scary.

11:27.946 --> 11:32.910
Plus - Didn't seem scary.
Well, you weren't flying
reconnaissance flights over Cuba.

11:32.910 --> 11:34.661
You flew reconnaissance -

11:34.661 --> 11:36.580
I was in an F-4 Phantom escort.

11:36.580 --> 11:41.835
One of our U-2s got shot down
photographing the missile bases.
My squadron went in after.

11:41.835 --> 11:46.923
And Sam, I gotta tell you,
you don't realise how close we came
to World War Three.

11:46.923 --> 11:49.134
I mean, total annihilation.

11:49.676 --> 11:55.307
But Kennedy doesn't attack Cuba,
and Khrushchev removes
all the missiles, right?

11:55.307 --> 11:56.975
That's right.

11:57.851 --> 11:59.603
But erm...

11:59.603 --> 12:02.230
another kind of bomb goes off
in this backyard.

12:03.690 --> 12:05.108
You see that gun?

12:05.108 --> 12:07.235
Someone in the family gets shot?

12:07.235 --> 12:12.449
The neighbour, Burt Rosecranz.
There's a 99% chance you're here
to stop him getting shot.

12:12.449 --> 12:14.117
How does it happen?

12:14.117 --> 12:17.454
Ziggy's still trying to get into
the court transcripts,

12:17.454 --> 12:22.751
but a newspaper article said Mac
shot Burt when he tried to break
into the shelter tomorrow.

12:22.751 --> 12:24.211
No.

12:24.711 --> 12:30.300
Mac gets 20 years, Kate and the kids
lose the business, the house, the
cars, and worst of all, Mac.

12:30.300 --> 12:34.554
It still doesn't make any sense.
Why would somebody shoot their
neighbour?

12:34.721 --> 12:37.849
It was the Cuban Missile Crisis.
What does that mean?

12:37.849 --> 12:40.310
Sam, you don't remember,
but people then,

12:40.310 --> 12:43.647
normal people,
ordinarily normal people,

12:43.647 --> 12:46.358
stocked their shelters with weapons.

12:47.067 --> 12:50.862
They said they would shoot their
friends to protect their family.

12:50.862 --> 12:52.280
That's insane.

12:52.280 --> 12:55.158
What's gonna happen here
tomorrow night is insane.

12:56.368 --> 12:58.412
Unless I can stop Mac. I know.

13:00.539 --> 13:02.582
I'll do it.

13:02.749 --> 13:04.835
Good.

13:05.710 --> 13:07.796
Somehow.

13:13.951 --> 13:16.495
Wow. Look at all the fighters.
There they go.

13:16.495 --> 13:18.330
They'll stop those Ruskies.

13:18.330 --> 13:20.791
And if they don't,
then we'll duck and cover.

13:22.292 --> 13:24.461
Then we'll hide in the bomb shelter.

13:24.461 --> 13:27.839
Then the Ruskies are gonna come down
and attack our cities.

13:27.839 --> 13:29.633
What's gonna happen to us?

13:29.633 --> 13:31.802
Well, they'll try to kill us.

13:31.802 --> 13:34.054
Then they'll -
Stop that, Stevie.

13:34.054 --> 13:36.014
You liar.

13:36.014 --> 13:39.685
Don't worry. Me and dad and Uncle
Eddie will fight 'em off. Right?

13:40.310 --> 13:42.354
Why do they want to kill us?

13:43.021 --> 13:45.023
Well, they don't.
Yes, they do.

13:46.191 --> 13:48.527
No, Stevie, the Russians
are just like us.

13:49.444 --> 13:50.946
But they're evil.

13:50.946 --> 13:52.322
No, they're not.

13:52.322 --> 13:54.825
See, they got families and...kids

13:54.825 --> 13:57.244
and they got dogs,
just like you guys do.

13:57.244 --> 13:59.162
All the children go to school.

13:59.162 --> 14:01.206
Yeah. They teach 'em to kill us.

14:01.665 --> 14:03.917
No, look. The Russian people
want peace.

14:04.626 --> 14:07.462
Dad, Uncle Eddie said the Russians
aren't evil.

14:07.462 --> 14:11.800
No, I just said I don't think
the Russian people are that different
from us.

14:11.800 --> 14:17.597
Well, how come they're building
a nuclear missile base not more
than 200 miles from our backyard?

14:17.597 --> 14:22.561
I got a feeling that Khrushchev's
gonna dismantle the whole thing
in a couple of days.

14:22.561 --> 14:24.938
You don't know that.
I do. I got a feeling.

14:24.938 --> 14:28.275
No, you don't. Not even Kennedy
or Khrushchev knows that.

14:28.275 --> 14:30.319
Dad, how far is 200 miles?

14:32.696 --> 14:34.531
It's a long, long way, son.

14:34.531 --> 14:38.035
I'm sorry. I'm just trying to make
the kids feel less afraid.

14:38.035 --> 14:40.579
Well, you're doing a hell of a job,
you know?

14:40.579 --> 14:44.333
Hey, come on, let's go get some
dinner. What do you say?

14:44.333 --> 14:46.043
Good. I'm starving.

14:46.043 --> 14:48.086
Full speed ahead, Dad.

14:51.882 --> 14:53.133
What are you doing?

14:53.133 --> 14:55.844
Oh, just thought I'd drop in,
say hello.

14:56.636 --> 14:58.680
That's nice.

14:58.972 --> 15:03.894
You know, I'm very flattered
that I'm the only human being
you've picked on to talk to.

15:03.894 --> 15:08.398
We interrupt our regularly scheduled
programme for this special bulletin.

15:08.398 --> 15:14.237
The Pentagon has just reported that
US naval vessels intercepted a
Russian cargo ship headed for Cuba.

15:15.030 --> 15:20.535
The vessel was later allowed to pass
through the blockade when a visual
inspection determined

15:20.535 --> 15:25.499
that no offensive missiles
were hidden onboard.
However, the clock is ticking down,

15:25.499 --> 15:31.463
as the armada of US destroyers and
aircraft carriers are 18 hours from
a showdown with Soviet freighters.

15:31.588 --> 15:33.090
OK, kids,

15:33.090 --> 15:34.758
I figure it's blanket time.

15:34.758 --> 15:36.802
Come on. Come on now.

15:40.764 --> 15:44.059
Daddy, I'm too scared to go to bed.

15:44.810 --> 15:47.521
Well, I'll come and tuck you in
in a minute, hon.

15:47.521 --> 15:49.272
Go on.

15:49.272 --> 15:51.316
Don't worry, Dad. I'll protect us.

15:52.025 --> 15:54.277
I know you will, partner.
I know you will.

15:55.153 --> 15:56.363
Go on.

15:56.363 --> 15:58.365
I'll be up, Stevie.
Good night.

16:02.994 --> 16:05.664
You know, when I was in the shelter
today I was...

16:06.832 --> 16:08.959
I was kinda wondering about the...

16:08.959 --> 16:11.211
shotgun and the kids and...

16:11.711 --> 16:13.880
Oh, it's locked. I got the only key.

16:13.880 --> 16:16.216
It's still dangerous having it
around.

16:16.216 --> 16:19.052
It's dangerous not to.
I gotta protect my family.

16:19.052 --> 16:20.554
From what?

16:20.554 --> 16:22.597
Ruskies, looters.

16:23.098 --> 16:25.225
Neighbours?

16:25.225 --> 16:26.643
Well...

16:26.643 --> 16:32.399
if a nuclear war started and someone
tried to break into my shelter,
he might expose us to radiation.

16:32.399 --> 16:35.902
I wouldn't have much choice,
would I, if I wanted us to survive.

16:39.906 --> 16:43.868
A lot of people think that the world
couldn't survive a nuclear war.

16:43.868 --> 16:49.124
Is that what those pinko egg heads
been teaching you in college?
What else did they tell you?

16:49.124 --> 16:52.502
That a nuclear blast would kick up
so much earth and debris

16:52.502 --> 16:56.381
that it would block out the sun
entirely, creating a nuclear winter.

16:56.965 --> 16:59.009
Nuclear winter.

16:59.259 --> 17:01.303
And everything would die.

17:03.972 --> 17:06.016
No. Not everything.

17:07.099 --> 17:09.144
We'd survive, Eddie.

17:09.519 --> 17:12.396
Just like we survived
Cimarron County in '35.

17:13.356 --> 17:14.941

17:14.941 --> 17:17.109
You see, you weren't even born then.

17:17.109 --> 17:20.195
You don't remember what it was like.
I'll never forget.

17:22.156 --> 17:24.200
That afternoon, there was no wind.

17:24.659 --> 17:26.703
It was just silent and still.

17:29.080 --> 17:32.208
Me and Pa were walking
a team of horses home...

17:33.668 --> 17:37.172
..when thousands of these birds
came flying by from the north.

17:38.340 --> 17:40.383
We looked back,

17:41.551 --> 17:43.595
and we seen it coming.

17:43.928 --> 17:49.059
This huge, rolling tidal wave of
earth spread across the sky.

17:49.476 --> 17:51.811
It drifted in like...like dark snow,

17:51.811 --> 17:56.483
blacking out the sun, making day
darker than night. It was like
the end of the earth.

17:56.816 --> 17:59.027
Pa grabbed me. We held on to his
horse.

17:59.027 --> 18:03.198
We weren't more than 100 yards off,
but we still could not find
our way home.

18:03.823 --> 18:05.867
It covered the farm in dust.

18:07.327 --> 18:09.371
Everything we had worked for died.

18:10.705 --> 18:13.958
And...I remember seeing the look
in Pa's face.

18:16.461 --> 18:18.505
Something in him died that day too.

18:21.132 --> 18:23.259
You never knew
what it was really like.

18:23.968 --> 18:26.012
God.

18:27.555 --> 18:29.140
No, I didn't, Mac.

18:30.141 --> 18:32.143
Well,

18:32.143 --> 18:34.270
we survived that.

18:34.270 --> 18:36.314

19:13.518 --> 19:15.562
Nothing out there, huh?

19:17.689 --> 19:19.816

19:19.816 --> 19:21.568
I can't.

how far 200 miles is.

19:40.336 --> 19:42.463
Have you ever been this scared
before?

19:43.464 --> 19:45.508
Yeah. I guess.

19:45.967 --> 19:48.636
When my mom was in the hospital
for an operation.

19:49.137 --> 19:51.180
I was afraid she might die.

19:53.558 --> 19:55.602
If you look back on that time now,

19:56.477 --> 20:01.065
you can see that you were worried
about something bad that didn't
happen, right?

20:01.065 --> 20:03.151
Yeah.

20:04.110 --> 20:05.653
Well, let's...

20:05.653 --> 20:08.740
Let's just pretend that you can
travel into the future,

20:09.324 --> 20:11.868
and look back on this time right now.

20:13.202 --> 20:16.914
Now, you'll see that the Russians
never hurt you or your family.

20:18.249 --> 20:21.919
And you'll see that you were spending
a lot of your time and energy

20:22.295 --> 20:25.173
being afraid of something bad
that never happened.

20:26.466 --> 20:28.259
So, being afraid is stupid?

20:28.259 --> 20:30.011
No. No.

20:30.011 --> 20:32.347
There's nothing wrong
with being afraid.

20:33.556 --> 20:35.975
Sometimes, it just doesn't do you
any good.

Let's pretend that we've travelled
into the future,

20:43.316 --> 20:45.360
and everything back here is OK.

they have some control
over the uncontrollable.

they can survive a nuclear war.

41:34.140 --> 41:36.393
Sam, it's Stevie! He's got the .38.

41:36.393 --> 41:38.937
Stevie, it's me, Burt.
Oh, God. Don't shoot.

41:38.937 --> 41:40.981
Stevie's up there.

41:41.690 --> 41:43.108
What?

41:43.108 --> 41:45.151
He's up there with your .38.

41:54.494 --> 41:56.538
Stevie...

41:57.247 --> 41:59.374
Stevie, put the gun down.

41:59.374 --> 42:01.418
Stevie, put down the gun.

42:01.418 --> 42:03.628
Look out, Uncle Eddie!
It's a Russian!

42:03.628 --> 42:05.463
(GUNSHOT)

42:06.840 --> 42:09.050
Burt, put down the shovel,
really slow.

42:10.468 --> 42:12.512
Burt, put the shovel...

42:13.263 --> 42:15.682
Stevie, come on, now.

42:17.392 --> 42:19.561
It's just Burt. Your neighbour Burt.

42:19.561 --> 42:21.605
Yeah. Stevie, it's me.

42:22.731 --> 42:24.858
You remember him. Look at him.

42:24.858 --> 42:26.901
Burt the turtle.

42:28.028 --> 42:29.529
He's gonna shoot again.

42:29.529 --> 42:32.699
The bomb! Stevie, quick. Duck and
cover. Duck and cover.

42:34.576 --> 42:36.578
I don't wanna die.
I don't wanna die.

42:37.329 --> 42:39.289
Where did he get the dress?

42:39.289 --> 42:41.625
Give me the gun. It's OK.
Everything's OK.

42:42.125 --> 42:44.294
Stevie, boy. Stevie.

42:44.294 --> 42:46.296
Stevie.
Stevie.

42:48.798 --> 42:51.051
Sam, it was Stevie who shot him
all along.

42:52.218 --> 42:54.971
Mac felt so guilty
that he took the blame himself.

42:58.391 --> 43:00.518
..the Soviet missile bases in Cuba

43:00.518 --> 43:02.562
are being dismantled,

43:02.562 --> 43:05.648
their missile and related equipment
are being crated,

43:06.107 --> 43:09.778
and the fixed installations
at these sites are being destroyed.

43:10.570 --> 43:11.863
(PHONE RINGS)

43:11.863 --> 43:13.907
What does that mean, Dad?

43:14.366 --> 43:16.618
Oh, well, uh...it means...

43:18.328 --> 43:20.038
it's over.

43:20.038 --> 43:22.165
No more bombs. No more Russians.

43:23.625 --> 43:26.503
You two kids don't have anything
to be scared of now.

43:26.878 --> 43:29.672
Good. I'm sick of being scared.

43:31.091 --> 43:33.134
You know, you were right.

43:34.052 --> 43:36.096
About a lot of things.

43:38.807 --> 43:40.475
That was Burt.

43:40.475 --> 43:42.644
♪ And Burt the turtle was very alert

43:42.644 --> 43:45.772
♪ When danger threatened
he never got hurt

43:45.772 --> 43:47.607
♪ He knew just what to do ♪

43:47.607 --> 43:49.734
Yeah. He just cancelled his cheque.

43:49.734 --> 43:51.778
Doesn't want to buy a shelter now.

43:54.114 --> 43:57.909
You can't really blame him. They
almost turned him into a colander.

43:58.201 --> 44:01.037
Mac, that makes five cancellations
today.

44:01.037 --> 44:02.664
I know. I know.

44:02.664 --> 44:03.790
(PHONE RINGS)

44:03.790 --> 44:05.166
Make that six.

44:05.166 --> 44:07.127
Make that six.

44:07.127 --> 44:11.548
I don't know what I'm gonna do. I
have all my crews and my bulldozers.

44:14.050 --> 44:16.094
You can always do what Burt did.

44:16.302 --> 44:17.679
What's that?

44:17.679 --> 44:19.764
Well, put in pools.

44:19.764 --> 44:21.266
Swimming pools?

44:21.266 --> 44:24.018
Swimming pools?
Yeah, you already got the crews

44:24.018 --> 44:26.146
and all the equipment.

44:26.146 --> 44:28.314
You could sell fun instead of...fear.

44:29.149 --> 44:32.777
Sell fun instead of fear.
That's great.

44:34.946 --> 44:37.282
Swimming pools? Hey, that's good,
Sam.

44:37.282 --> 44:40.285
You change history.
Eddie graduates from college

44:40.285 --> 44:44.455
and he helps Mac build the biggest
swimming pool company
in South Florida.

44:45.498 --> 44:47.542
I'll think about it.

45:01.514 --> 45:03.558
Hey, hey, hey. What's going on here?

45:04.559 --> 45:06.853
Nobody punches me
and gets away with it.

45:06.853 --> 45:08.563
Nobody.

45:08.563 --> 45:10.607
Argh!

45:11.274 --> 45:13.318
Butch?

45:13.651 --> 45:15.028
What are you doing?

45:15.028 --> 45:18.781
Dr Masters wanted me to calm him
down. So, I'm going to calm him
down.

45:19.908 --> 45:22.201
You're not giving him
shock treatment?

45:22.201 --> 45:23.411
Shock?

45:23.411 --> 45:25.371
You watch me.

45:25.371 --> 45:29.584
Wait. You know the rules.
Only a doctor's allowed to
administer shock.

45:29.584 --> 45:32.545
My doctor told me to do it,
and that's close enough.

45:32.545 --> 45:35.298
Just wait a minute. I wanna go get
Dr Masters, OK?

45:35.298 --> 45:37.342
(GROANING IN PROTEST)

45:37.634 --> 45:40.803
No, you can't do that.
That's too high. You'll kill him!

45:40.803 --> 45:42.847
