00:00.777 --> 00:02.117
Mr. Hotate, hi.

00:02.118 --> 00:03.326
Thank you for coming.

00:03.327 --> 00:04.367
Would you like some water?

00:04.628 --> 00:07.680
Water?
Like fire water?

00:07.715 --> 00:09.916
That's racist,
and I do not appreciate it.

00:09.950 --> 00:11.801
No, no, no, no, no.
I-I didn't mean it like that.

00:11.852 --> 00:13.269
I just meant, you know--

00:13.304 --> 00:14.304
I'm just messing with you.

00:14.355 --> 00:16.254
Oh, my God!

00:16.273 --> 00:17.590
He's funny.
This guy's funny.

00:17.608 --> 00:18.858
- He does that sometimes.
- But seriously.

00:18.893 --> 00:20.927
I'll have a whiskey.

00:20.945 --> 00:24.063
Ken Hotate is the leader
of the Wamapoke people,

00:24.097 --> 00:25.398
and we are trying to get them involved

00:25.432 --> 00:26.900
in our Pawnee Commons project.

00:26.934 --> 00:28.618
Ken and I get along great.

00:28.652 --> 00:30.703
But historically, Pawnee's relationship

00:30.738 --> 00:34.071
with the Wamapoke has been more...

00:34.458 --> 00:35.742
Murder-y.

00:35.776 --> 00:38.127
What about--and I'm just
spit-balling here--

00:38.162 --> 00:41.197
a large neon advertisement
for the Wamapoke casino?

00:41.232 --> 00:43.550
We have a new slogan
that I'm quite proud of:

00:43.584 --> 00:46.417
"Our slots
are downright filthy."

00:46.554 --> 00:48.889
I think it's a slam-dunk idea.
I think we're done here.

00:48.923 --> 00:50.257
I don't--
I don't think we are.

00:50.291 --> 00:52.125
I don't know if we could
put that in a public park.

00:52.143 --> 00:54.961
In that case,
the playground will be great.

00:55.479 --> 00:58.298
Why don't we retire to my longhouse

00:58.299 --> 01:00.516
and smoke the ceremonial
peace pipe to celebrate?

01:02.653 --> 01:04.604
- Is he joking?
- I don't know.

01:24.842 --> 01:26.626
Well, well, well.

01:26.677 --> 01:29.662
If it isn't Mr. Best Man
and Bachelor boy.

01:29.663 --> 01:31.631
Ann Perkins, Maid of Honor,

01:31.665 --> 01:33.332
are you ready
for the bachelorette party?

01:33.350 --> 01:34.434
Uh, more than ready.

01:34.468 --> 01:36.803
We've got dancing,
Jell-o shots,

01:36.837 --> 01:38.004
private karaoke,

01:38.022 --> 01:39.806
and anything
that can be penis-shaped

01:39.840 --> 01:41.274
will be penis-shaped.

01:41.308 --> 01:42.475
- Ohhh!
- What?

01:42.509 --> 01:44.510
As Leslie's maid of honor,

01:44.528 --> 01:47.814
I really need her
bachelorette party to go well.

01:47.848 --> 01:50.850
Which is why I'm stress-eating
gummy penises.

01:54.204 --> 01:55.955
What are you losers doing
for your bachelor party?

01:55.990 --> 01:57.957
I told Ben he could do
whatever he wants.

01:57.992 --> 01:59.025
Sky is the limit.

01:59.043 --> 02:02.028
We have Haverford,
Swanson, Dwyer--

02:02.062 --> 02:03.582
Jerry forced his way
in there somehow--

02:03.631 --> 02:05.665
things are bound to get crazy.

02:05.699 --> 02:09.532
The game is Settlers of Catan.

02:09.669 --> 02:12.538
The object is be the first
to build a civilization

02:12.556 --> 02:13.973
on this fictional island.

02:14.008 --> 02:15.224
I can't believe
this is what you want to do

02:15.259 --> 02:16.476
for your bachelor party.

02:16.510 --> 02:18.270
Look, guys,
we don't have to play this game

02:18.312 --> 02:19.262
if you don't want to.

02:19.313 --> 02:21.714
I mean, I'm nationally ranked,

02:21.732 --> 02:23.182
so it isn't even really fair.

02:23.216 --> 02:25.435
Ben, this is your night.

02:25.486 --> 02:26.719
We do what you want to do.

02:26.737 --> 02:28.521
Come on, let's play.

02:28.555 --> 02:31.024
I'm not a big bachelor party
kind of guy,

02:31.058 --> 02:33.026
so when the guys asked me
what my perfect night would be,

02:33.060 --> 02:35.695
I told them the truth--
beer and board games.

02:35.729 --> 02:38.615
They thought I was kidding.

02:38.666 --> 02:40.283
I was not kidding.

02:40.334 --> 02:42.619
Is this gonna be one of
those cool bachelorette parties

02:42.670 --> 02:45.371
where things get out of control
and we murder someone,

02:45.405 --> 02:46.706
and then we all have to take
a blood oath

02:46.740 --> 02:48.174
to never reveal our secret?

02:48.208 --> 02:50.126
No.

02:50.177 --> 02:53.046
Then I might have to leave early.

02:53.080 --> 02:54.413
What the hell?

02:56.350 --> 02:57.667
Well, well, well.

02:57.685 --> 02:59.552
Don't you ladies look nice...
For once?

02:59.603 --> 03:01.504
Just kidding.
I've actually always been

03:01.522 --> 03:03.006
attracted to this one.

03:03.040 --> 03:04.440
Jamm, what the hell are you doing?

03:04.442 --> 03:05.508
We're laying the groundwork

03:05.526 --> 03:06.559
for Pawnee's newest restaurant.

03:06.610 --> 03:08.311
"Future home of Paunch Burger.

03:08.345 --> 03:10.012
Start drooling, fatties"?

03:10.030 --> 03:11.481
Look, the deal was that both of us

03:11.515 --> 03:13.032
had three months to get
our proposals together,

03:13.067 --> 03:14.451
and then we put it up for a vote.

03:14.485 --> 03:16.953
- We still have two weeks left.
- Yeah, that's true.

03:16.987 --> 03:19.622
However, here's the problem.

03:19.657 --> 03:20.990
Turns out, I don't care.

03:21.024 --> 03:22.242
You can't stop this train.

03:22.293 --> 03:23.526
Make all the ruckus you want.

03:23.544 --> 03:25.194
By the time this all gets cleared up,

03:25.212 --> 03:27.163
the people will be frothing
at the mouth

03:27.197 --> 03:28.164
for that beef.

03:28.198 --> 03:31.000
Aw, sweet!
A new Paunch Burger.

03:31.034 --> 03:33.870
Their burgers will kill you!
They're full of wasps!

03:33.888 --> 03:35.371
Yeah, but they taste real good.

03:35.639 --> 03:37.123
Yes, they do, sir.

03:37.141 --> 03:39.625
Once again, open invitation.

03:39.643 --> 03:41.594
I'm still technically married,
but my wife knows the deal.

03:41.628 --> 03:43.429
Ugh.

03:43.463 --> 03:44.931
Oh, I'm sorry, what's this?

03:44.965 --> 03:48.298
Seven contiguous segments,
giving me longest road

03:48.819 --> 03:51.237
and a sweet-ass ten points
for the win.

03:51.271 --> 03:52.605
Oh, booyah!

03:52.639 --> 03:53.856
Okay.
All right.

03:53.907 --> 03:55.641
Guys, come on over here.
Gather round.

03:55.659 --> 03:57.076
I want to propose a toast.

03:57.111 --> 03:59.696
To our new Lord of Catan,

03:59.747 --> 04:01.531
Ben Wyatt, a great friend

04:01.582 --> 04:02.815
and a wonderful man.

04:02.833 --> 04:05.484
May you and Leslie find
eternal happiness together.

04:05.502 --> 04:07.537
- Hey.
- Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

04:07.588 --> 04:09.655
Thanks, you guys.
Thanks for indulging me.

04:09.673 --> 04:10.923
Hey, you want to stick around?

04:10.958 --> 04:12.491
I got a bunch of <i>Homeland</i> episodes

04:12.509 --> 04:14.043
burning a hole in my DVR.

04:14.094 --> 04:15.261
No!

04:15.295 --> 04:16.879
I'm sorry.
On principle,

04:16.930 --> 04:18.598
I cannot stand idly by

04:18.632 --> 04:20.499
and watch a bachelor party
peter out like this.

04:20.517 --> 04:21.834
Now, I know you said no strippers

04:21.851 --> 04:23.102
'cause they make you sad.

04:23.137 --> 04:24.336
Correct.

04:24.354 --> 04:25.671
Then let's go get a drink at Essence.

04:25.689 --> 04:27.273
It's the hot new bar in Eagleton.

04:27.307 --> 04:30.509
<i>Things Magazine</i> said
it's the next big thing.

04:30.527 --> 04:31.894
But, Tom, this is Ben's night.

04:31.945 --> 04:34.464
Oh, believe me,
if the group's happy, I'm happy.

04:34.498 --> 04:35.481
- I'd go.
- If you guys spot me.

04:35.515 --> 04:36.515
It sounds expensive.

04:36.533 --> 04:37.817
Just so you know,

04:37.851 --> 04:39.318
it's not your typical bar.

04:39.352 --> 04:41.687
They specialize in molecular mixology.

04:41.705 --> 04:44.023
It's kind of like
an experimental new way

04:44.041 --> 04:45.357
to consume alcohol.

04:45.375 --> 04:48.708
Son, there's no wrong way
to consume alcohol.

04:52.199 --> 04:53.299
Here's your Bud light.

04:53.333 --> 04:55.168
- I ordered a beer.
- That is a beer.

04:55.202 --> 04:58.535
And here's your Nimbus Martini.

04:58.889 --> 05:00.372
May I go ahead and chisel
your aromasphere?

05:00.390 --> 05:03.723
Please!

05:04.678 --> 05:07.013
This is the wrong way
to consume alcohol.

05:07.047 --> 05:09.482
Whoa, that's a pretty stiff cloud.

05:09.516 --> 05:11.317
- Who ordered the Scotch?
- Right here.

05:11.351 --> 05:14.353
Hold out your hands, please.

05:16.356 --> 05:17.607
What's happening?

05:17.658 --> 05:20.276
Oh, this is a sort of play on Scotch.

05:20.327 --> 05:22.445
It's a whiskey-infused lotion.

05:22.496 --> 05:24.396
Can I ask if this entire establishment

05:24.414 --> 05:26.532
is a practical joke of some kind?

05:26.566 --> 05:28.034
If you don't like the Scotch,
they have a vodka

05:28.068 --> 05:31.070
that's served in the form
of a flash of light.

05:33.090 --> 05:34.457
Hey.

05:34.491 --> 05:35.708
Having fun?

05:35.742 --> 05:37.460
Well, four years of work
down the drain,

05:37.511 --> 05:38.911
and I have a penis on my head.

05:38.929 --> 05:41.580
Jamm is stealing this lot
right out from under us.

05:41.598 --> 05:43.633
My dream is dead, Ann.
Mine too.

05:43.684 --> 05:45.751
This is why I prefer nightmares.

05:45.769 --> 05:47.170
You are sad drinking right now,

05:47.204 --> 05:50.089
and I need you to be happy drinking.

05:50.107 --> 05:51.974
Like when we watch <i>Grease</i> together.

05:52.025 --> 05:53.592
I know, Ann, but everything's
gonna disappear.

05:53.610 --> 05:56.479
April's mini-dog park,
the Li'l Sebastian fountain,

05:56.530 --> 05:57.897
even the Wamapoke playground.

05:57.931 --> 06:00.233
Yet another piece of Wamapoke land

06:00.267 --> 06:01.934
plowed over by the white man.

06:01.952 --> 06:03.319
Just try to forget about it.

06:03.370 --> 06:06.703
I mean, there's nothing
you can do to stop them tonight.

06:07.858 --> 06:09.859
For almost 200 years,
Pawnee repeatedly built

06:09.877 --> 06:12.629
factories, restaurants, and other stuff

06:12.663 --> 06:15.197
on land held sacred
by the Wamapoke people.

06:15.215 --> 06:17.250
So we passed a law

06:17.301 --> 06:19.419
saying that
if any sacred Wamapoke artifact

06:19.470 --> 06:21.421
is found on a development site,

06:21.472 --> 06:24.340
all construction must immediately stop.

06:24.374 --> 06:26.676
It would be terrible
if that were to happen

06:26.710 --> 06:28.044
on this future Paunch Burger site.

06:33.734 --> 06:35.768
Oh, this is bad.

06:36.319 --> 06:37.654
I should not have done this.

06:41.442 --> 06:44.227
Oh, I wonder who that is.

06:44.278 --> 06:46.729
Well, if it isn't Babe Lincoln!

06:46.780 --> 06:49.065
- Imagine that.
- Hello, ladies.

06:49.116 --> 06:50.566
I'm Abraham Lincoln.

06:50.601 --> 06:52.118
Who's the lucky Mary Todd?

06:52.152 --> 06:53.853
Right here.
Right here.

06:53.871 --> 06:54.854
Ah, ah, ah, me first.

06:54.872 --> 06:55.872
Me first.
Oh, okay.

06:55.906 --> 06:57.740
All right, tear it up, 16!

06:57.791 --> 06:59.242
Emancipate them abs.

07:02.212 --> 07:03.195
Come on, Ann, not now.

07:03.213 --> 07:04.330
Come on, Leslie, just loosen up.

07:04.364 --> 07:05.581
I know for a fact

07:05.632 --> 07:06.916
this is a sex dream you've had.

07:06.967 --> 07:07.917
Looks like it's time

07:07.968 --> 07:09.969
for the Gettysburg undressed!

07:10.003 --> 07:11.420
Okay.

07:11.472 --> 07:13.806
And we're gonna have to stop now.

07:13.841 --> 07:15.441
I'm sorry, I'm just not in the mood

07:15.476 --> 07:17.143
for historical nudity.

07:17.177 --> 07:19.712
Please, Mr. president,
put your pants back on.

07:19.730 --> 07:21.347
Ann, can I speak with you privately?

07:21.381 --> 07:22.849
Is your name Glenn?

07:22.883 --> 07:24.600
- Yeah.
- I sat behind you

07:24.635 --> 07:25.651
in middle school band.

07:25.686 --> 07:26.986
Do you still play the clarinet?

07:27.020 --> 07:28.721
Yeah.

07:28.739 --> 07:31.891
How have you been, man?

07:33.360 --> 07:34.880
Man, if I ever have a bachelor party,

07:34.895 --> 07:36.445
I am definitely coming back here.

07:36.497 --> 07:38.577
You never had one before
you were married to Wendy?

07:38.582 --> 07:39.949
No, it was a green card wedding.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.033
I did watch
the three-way sex scene

07:41.067 --> 07:42.568
from <i>Wild Things</i> a few times

07:42.586 --> 07:44.537
the night before,
but it didn't really count.

07:44.571 --> 07:46.706
I never had a bachelor party either.

07:46.740 --> 07:48.207
Me and April, we got married
with no warning.

07:48.241 --> 07:49.481
I didn't even have time

07:49.510 --> 07:50.676
to take a shower before my wedding.

07:50.711 --> 07:52.929
Or after.

07:52.963 --> 07:54.130
For, like, a week and a half.

07:54.181 --> 07:55.631
Tammy One forbade me

07:55.666 --> 07:58.017
from any kind of celebration,

07:58.051 --> 07:59.635
and Tammy Two thwarted me by calling in

07:59.686 --> 08:01.804
a bomb threat to the steakhouse.

08:01.855 --> 08:03.189
I didn't have one either!

08:03.223 --> 08:04.557
Yeah, really, it's a funny story.

08:04.591 --> 08:06.592
So two weeks before I married Gayle,

08:06.610 --> 08:08.060
I had an emergency appendectomy.

08:08.094 --> 08:10.730
Boop! That's me hitting
the snooze button.

08:10.764 --> 08:12.365
Don't talk again
for another ten minutes.

08:12.366 --> 08:13.599
New idea!

08:13.617 --> 08:16.536
Tonight, everyone
gets the bachelor party

08:16.570 --> 08:17.570
they never had.

08:17.604 --> 08:20.105
One activity per bachelor.

08:20.123 --> 08:21.991
Welcome to Tom's bachelor party,

08:22.042 --> 08:24.994
held in a white airplane hangar
from the ice planet Hoth,

08:25.045 --> 08:27.580
replete with dangling,
beautiful aerialists.

08:27.614 --> 08:28.581
To Tom Haverford.

08:28.615 --> 08:29.632
To Tom Haverford!

08:32.419 --> 08:35.554
Hey, hey--
and to my bride, Rihanna.

08:35.589 --> 08:37.722
We truly did find love
in a hopeless place.

08:37.758 --> 08:40.092
Waiter, a round
of light-flash shots

08:40.126 --> 08:41.344
for me and my friends!

08:41.395 --> 08:42.727
- Ohhh!
- Whoo!

08:42.763 --> 08:44.730
Okay, so what happened?

08:44.765 --> 08:47.350
Well, I buried a bunch
of Wamapoke artifacts

08:47.401 --> 08:48.351
in the dirt

08:48.402 --> 08:49.969
so that people would find them

08:49.987 --> 08:52.238
and have to stop developing
at the site.

08:52.272 --> 08:54.774
You know, when I say it out
loud, it doesn't sound so bad.

08:54.808 --> 08:57.026
- No, that's bad.
- Yeah, that's pretty uncool.

08:57.077 --> 08:59.278
- Shut up, Glenn.
- I'm sorry, guys.

08:59.312 --> 09:00.830
Councilman Jamm was being sneaky,

09:00.864 --> 09:02.665
and then I tried to sneaky him back,

09:02.699 --> 09:05.701
and it turned to crummy,
and I have to undo it.

09:05.752 --> 09:07.420
I need your help.

09:07.454 --> 09:09.372
- You don't mean--
- I do.

09:09.423 --> 09:10.823
No.
I'm not doing that.

09:13.660 --> 09:14.760
You guys, the penis hats

09:14.795 --> 09:16.095
cut your digging time in half.

09:16.129 --> 09:17.546
I'm serious.
Don't be afraid.

09:17.598 --> 09:19.465
Use the penises.

09:19.499 --> 09:21.684
Bachelorette party.

09:21.718 --> 09:23.052
Whoo.

09:23.103 --> 09:25.838
Perkins does it again.

09:27.173 --> 09:29.942
You know, I met Gayle
right here at Sherm's.

09:29.977 --> 09:31.560
- Mm-mm.
- She was slender.

09:31.612 --> 09:34.780
Blonde hair, big breasts, long legs.

09:34.815 --> 09:37.083
Ugh, not my type at all.

09:37.117 --> 09:39.235
And what was it, exactly,
that led to you two

09:39.286 --> 09:40.236
hitting it off?

09:40.287 --> 09:41.520
Was she ill,

09:41.538 --> 09:43.823
or did your father witness her father

09:43.857 --> 09:45.207
committing a crime?

09:45.242 --> 09:46.626
- Or was she temporarily blind--
- You know what?

09:46.660 --> 09:47.960
All that matters
is that you got married,

09:47.995 --> 09:48.961
and you're happy.

09:48.996 --> 09:51.163
So as all-time best man,

09:51.197 --> 09:53.749
I suggest we raise a cone
to Jerry Gergich.

09:53.800 --> 09:54.750
Jerry Gergich.

09:54.801 --> 09:55.968
- Jerry!
- Thank you.

09:56.003 --> 09:58.254
- Gergich.
- Aw, jeez.

09:58.305 --> 09:59.639
No worries, Gary.

09:59.673 --> 10:00.806
Oh, thanks, Sherm.

10:02.208 --> 10:04.010
How did you have that ready so fast?

10:04.044 --> 10:05.645
I always make a backup cone.

10:05.679 --> 10:07.847
He drops it about half the time.

10:07.881 --> 10:09.849
Andy, you're next.

10:09.883 --> 10:12.018
Any activity in the world.
What would you do?

10:12.052 --> 10:13.492
Well, mine's impossible.

10:13.520 --> 10:15.021
I want to see a Colts game.

10:15.055 --> 10:17.073
I want to see the Colts
beat the Patriots 49 to nothing,

10:17.107 --> 10:18.774
then I yell at Tom Brady
and make him cry,

10:18.825 --> 10:20.146
then I hook up with Dave Matthews,

10:20.160 --> 10:22.078
and we play golden tee for ten hours.

10:22.112 --> 10:23.279
♪ A-la-la baby

10:23.330 --> 10:26.663
that's a very specific dream, son.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.333
Hey, Jim, Chris Traeger.
I need a favor.

10:31.455 --> 10:33.122
I'm dead.
I am dead.

10:33.173 --> 10:35.708
And this is what heaven is like.

10:35.742 --> 10:36.876
I knew it.

10:36.910 --> 10:39.512
Oh, this is where they play the games!

10:39.946 --> 10:41.864
You're up, Andy.

10:41.898 --> 10:44.416
Hey, guys!
Guys, come on over here.

10:44.434 --> 10:45.417
Andy, I want you to meet

10:45.435 --> 10:47.970
Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay.

10:48.021 --> 10:49.522
Andy, good to meet you, my friend.

10:49.556 --> 10:51.557
Thank you.
I love your team, sir.

10:51.591 --> 10:53.392
I love them
like they're my own children.

10:53.426 --> 10:54.694
You're big enough
to play football yourself,

10:54.728 --> 10:55.811
it looks like to me.

10:55.862 --> 10:57.396
I can't tell if you're joking,

10:57.430 --> 10:58.864
but I hope you're not.

10:58.899 --> 11:01.150
This whole place is yours.

11:01.201 --> 11:02.441
Jim Irsay and I became friends

11:02.452 --> 11:05.037
while volunteering to mentor
Indianapolis teens.

11:05.072 --> 11:07.123
I gave them tours of the state house.

11:07.157 --> 11:10.490
Jim gave them Colts tickets
and autographed jerseys.

11:10.844 --> 11:12.411
They preferred Jim.

11:12.445 --> 11:14.080
Reggie Wayne.
I can't look at you,

11:14.114 --> 11:16.082
Reggie Wayne.
Oh.

11:16.116 --> 11:18.667
I got married in your jersey.
That's no joke.

11:18.719 --> 11:21.003
That's weird.
But I respect that.

11:21.054 --> 11:22.888
I'm a big fan,
Mr. Luck.

11:22.923 --> 11:24.557
Okay, guy, settle down.

11:24.591 --> 11:26.425
- Okay.
- Uh, Mr. Andrew Luck,

11:26.459 --> 11:28.961
it's every groom's dream
to catch a touchdown pass

11:28.979 --> 11:29.962
thrown by you.

11:29.980 --> 11:31.180
Could you do me the honor?

11:31.231 --> 11:32.848
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Keep the spiral tight.

11:32.899 --> 11:33.849
- I'll try.
- Okay.

11:40.690 --> 11:42.024
Touchdown, Dwyer!

11:43.994 --> 11:45.144
- Andy!
- Yeah!

Hello?

12:02.162 --> 12:04.163
- Ann Perkins!
- Ann Perkins!

12:05.999 --> 12:07.299
We're having the time of our lives,

12:07.333 --> 12:08.934
and I'm calling you to rub it in!

12:08.969 --> 12:10.052
- Whoo!
- Boom!

12:10.103 --> 12:11.837
- Really.
- We went to an insane bar,

12:11.855 --> 12:13.773
played football with the Colts.

12:13.807 --> 12:15.057
- With the Colts!
- The Colts!

12:15.108 --> 12:16.225
Football!

12:16.276 --> 12:17.516
Now we're going to a steakhouse.

12:17.527 --> 12:18.727
What are you doing?

12:18.779 --> 12:21.680
Uh, well, we're surrounded by hot guys.

12:21.698 --> 12:24.150
- We're surrounded by hot guys.
- Boom!

12:24.184 --> 12:27.153
Oh, Donna just ripped off
a stripper's underwear

12:27.187 --> 12:28.687
with her teeth.

12:28.705 --> 12:30.026
- Whoo!
- Ann, who are you lying to?

12:30.040 --> 12:31.240
- Shh.
- No!

12:31.291 --> 12:33.659
Can I take a break?
My hands are tired.

12:33.693 --> 12:34.994
Uhuh.
We paid for an hour.

12:35.028 --> 12:36.662
You gonna dig for an hour.

12:36.696 --> 12:40.029
Gentlemen, welcome
to the Steak House of St. Elmo.

12:40.217 --> 12:41.250
- Whoo!
- Yes!

12:41.301 --> 12:43.002
Tonight we eat something's flesh!

12:43.036 --> 12:45.137
I want meat!

12:45.172 --> 12:46.422
Jerry, are you sure this is our table?

12:46.473 --> 12:48.140
There's only four settings.

12:48.175 --> 12:49.508
Excuse me, sir.
This is not your table.

12:49.542 --> 12:51.477
Well, I thought you said
the Gergich party.

12:51.511 --> 12:53.378
No, no, I said the Gingrich party.

12:53.396 --> 12:55.815
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

12:55.849 --> 12:57.433
Damn it, Jerry.

12:57.484 --> 12:59.735
But you know what?
Gingrich, Gergich.

12:59.769 --> 13:01.937
I wonder if we're related.

13:01.988 --> 13:03.189
I don't think so, Jerry.

13:03.223 --> 13:05.858
Okay.

13:05.892 --> 13:07.276
One rare porterhouse,

13:07.327 --> 13:08.944
one rare sirloin,
and a rasher of bacon.

13:08.995 --> 13:10.279
- Oh.
- It's the lord's work

13:10.330 --> 13:11.530
you're doing, John.

13:11.564 --> 13:13.332
I'd like four more glasses

13:13.366 --> 13:15.451
of Lagavulin in liquid form.

13:15.502 --> 13:16.902
That's not something
you really need to specify.

13:16.920 --> 13:18.954
You'd be surprised.

13:19.005 --> 13:20.873
So, bachelor boy,

13:20.907 --> 13:22.007
how's it going with Diane?

13:22.042 --> 13:23.175
Hmm.

13:23.210 --> 13:25.628
I'm gonna be very candid with you all.

13:25.679 --> 13:27.213
I like her.

13:27.247 --> 13:28.514
- Whoa!
- Wow!

13:30.016 --> 13:32.384
Okay, okay, okay.

13:32.418 --> 13:34.920
There are so many things
that I could say about Ron,

13:34.938 --> 13:36.889
but I think that the best man's speech

13:36.923 --> 13:39.191
should represent the groom.

13:39.226 --> 13:41.360
So I will just say...

13:41.394 --> 13:42.361
To Ron.

13:42.395 --> 13:43.395
- Oh, to Ron!
- To Ron!

13:43.429 --> 13:44.697
To Ron.

13:44.731 --> 13:46.532
Just perfect.
Perfect, Chris.

13:46.566 --> 13:48.067
Here you are, sir.

13:48.101 --> 13:49.401
And I thought you might
also like to know

13:49.435 --> 13:50.903
that your meal has already
been taken care of

13:50.937 --> 13:52.905
- by Mr. Hibbert.
- W-what?

13:52.939 --> 13:53.939
- Oh!
- Oh!

13:53.957 --> 13:57.042
- Hey!
- Oh, whoa!

13:57.077 --> 13:58.077
What's up, Jell-o shot?

13:58.111 --> 13:59.278
- Hey, man.
- How's it going?

13:59.296 --> 14:01.613
Roy Hibbert.
Entertainment 720 reunion.

14:01.631 --> 14:02.614
Hey, Tom.

14:02.632 --> 14:04.049
I am not paying for that guy.

14:04.084 --> 14:06.552
He owes me a lot of money.

14:06.586 --> 14:07.836
It's true.

14:09.322 --> 14:10.606
Coffee?

14:10.640 --> 14:13.225
Yes, please.
Take extra cream, 30 sugars.

14:13.260 --> 14:15.561
I can't believe I tried
to exploit the Wamapoke

14:15.595 --> 14:17.897
for my own personal gain.

14:17.931 --> 14:19.398
Well, we got most of the artifacts,

14:19.432 --> 14:20.966
and even if we didn't,
they probably won't find them.

14:20.984 --> 14:22.735
Yeah, and if they do,

14:22.769 --> 14:24.203
you'll just go to jail.

14:24.237 --> 14:26.105
But you can make wine in your toilet

14:26.139 --> 14:27.106
and fight people,

14:27.140 --> 14:28.974
which is a super-cool way
to live.

14:29.009 --> 14:30.492
Oh, my God.
Tweep.

14:30.527 --> 14:32.278
I tweeped.
I called Tweep.

14:32.312 --> 14:33.946
Look, I'm telling the truth here, lady.

14:33.980 --> 14:36.815
We haven't found
any American Indian artifacts.

14:36.833 --> 14:38.417
Or regular Indian.

14:38.451 --> 14:41.620
Japanese, Muslim, Jewish,

14:41.654 --> 14:43.088
none of those weird countries.

14:43.123 --> 14:45.124
- Weird countries?
- Shauna Malwae-Tweep.

14:45.158 --> 14:47.259
Wow, I'm so glad that you're here.

14:47.294 --> 14:48.928
What's going on? Nothing?

14:48.962 --> 14:50.996
Found something!
There's other stuff too.

14:51.014 --> 14:53.766
Arrowheads, more pottery.

14:53.800 --> 14:56.302
I also found some weird-looking
gummy candy.

14:56.336 --> 14:57.469
All right, shut it down.

14:57.503 --> 14:58.887
This is a P.R. nightmare.

14:58.939 --> 15:00.105
We can't do anything

15:00.140 --> 15:01.840
until the Indian Affairs
Commission weighs in.

15:01.858 --> 15:05.060
This is [Bleeping] bull[bleep].

15:05.611 --> 15:06.962
Okay.

15:08.009 --> 15:10.788
Lesie, Ken Hotate is right over there,

15:10.789 --> 15:12.439
you need to talk to him
before the meeting

15:12.457 --> 15:14.074
and come clean.

15:15.076 --> 15:16.243
He's gonna be so mad.

15:16.277 --> 15:17.694
The zodiac killer never confessed.

15:17.695 --> 15:19.028
Why do I have to?

15:19.046 --> 15:22.032
Leslie, I want the Pawnee
Commons as bad as you do.

15:22.066 --> 15:23.733
Actually, that's not true.

15:23.768 --> 15:25.635
You want everything
a thousand times more than I do.

15:25.670 --> 15:28.471
But we do not want to win this way.

15:28.506 --> 15:30.390
Oh, April, I wish you weren't
right, but you are.

15:30.424 --> 15:32.309
You have turned
into a very beautiful, wise,

15:32.343 --> 15:34.177
and fertile government employee.

15:34.211 --> 15:36.713
Stop.

15:36.731 --> 15:38.047
It's kind of weird when she just starts

15:38.065 --> 15:39.516
raining compliments on you, huh?

15:39.550 --> 15:42.435
Don't try to bond with me.

15:42.486 --> 15:43.853
Can't win.

15:45.072 --> 15:47.490
Hey, guys,
I had these T-shirts made.

15:47.525 --> 15:49.859
They're not exactly
a summary of the party

15:49.893 --> 15:51.244
- we ended up having.
- Whoa.

15:51.279 --> 15:52.362
But they're a good memento.

15:52.396 --> 15:54.331
Madness indeed.

15:54.365 --> 15:55.582
I love this!

15:55.616 --> 15:58.285
Usually you can only get
board game t-shirts in XXL.

15:58.336 --> 15:59.619
I just remembered.

15:59.670 --> 16:02.038
We left Jerry back at
the gas station in Martinsville.

16:02.072 --> 16:03.373
I'll go get him.

16:03.407 --> 16:05.625
Ah, that guy's the best.

16:05.676 --> 16:07.460
I feel bad he didn't get
to have his moment last night.

16:07.511 --> 16:10.297
Hey, you know what
we should do for him?

16:10.348 --> 16:12.882
Yeah, get him a pet snake,
but I keep it.

16:12.916 --> 16:14.467
What?

16:14.518 --> 16:16.687
In 1921, several Wamapoke families

16:16.721 --> 16:18.055
were removed from their homes

16:18.089 --> 16:20.724
so that Pawnee could install
a bumper car track.

16:20.758 --> 16:23.777
In 1951, Pawnee made it illegal

16:23.812 --> 16:25.279
for people to,

16:25.313 --> 16:27.865
"Dance or smell
like a native American."

16:27.899 --> 16:29.432
Why are you telling me all this?

16:29.450 --> 16:31.552
Well, I want to raise the bar
of awfulness

16:31.586 --> 16:32.953
so that when I confess
something to you,

16:32.987 --> 16:35.155
you have perspective.

16:35.206 --> 16:37.291
Those artifacts found at lot 48

16:37.325 --> 16:38.659
were placed there by me.

16:39.210 --> 16:41.961
I wanted to delay construction
on the Paunch Burger

16:41.996 --> 16:44.080
and buy some more time
for my park project.

16:44.114 --> 16:46.750
That is not great.

16:46.784 --> 16:47.834
It sucks.

16:47.885 --> 16:49.285
I'm very, very sorry.

16:49.303 --> 16:51.721
I have great respect
for the Wamapoke culture.

16:51.756 --> 16:53.673
And this isn't even
about the Pawnee Commons.

16:53.724 --> 16:56.393
I just hope that you
can forgive me, Ken.

16:57.478 --> 16:59.045
Hey!

16:59.063 --> 17:00.313
Hey, guys.
What are you doing here?

17:00.348 --> 17:03.266
Congratulations. You have won
the award for Best Nan.

17:03.317 --> 17:05.819
Full disclosure--
I voted for Ryan Gosling,

17:05.853 --> 17:06.886
but you came in a close second.

17:06.904 --> 17:08.555
Now, you've never been married,

17:08.573 --> 17:10.223
so you didn't get
your own bachelor party.

17:10.241 --> 17:12.108
But let's look ahead.

17:12.160 --> 17:14.277
The year is 2018.

17:14.328 --> 17:17.164
America is thriving
under president Nick Cannon,

17:17.198 --> 17:20.066
and tomorrow,
Chris Traeger's getting married.

17:20.084 --> 17:21.535
Who's the lucky lady?

17:21.569 --> 17:24.503
Maybe she's an upbeat gal
who's nuts about fitness.

17:24.539 --> 17:26.957
Maybe she owns a juice bar in Snerling.

17:27.008 --> 17:29.459
Maybe it's April.
Maybe I die.

17:29.510 --> 17:31.545
Skydiving explosion.
Pbbbt.

17:31.579 --> 17:32.963
And then you go marry April.

17:33.014 --> 17:34.347
And it makes me sad,

17:34.382 --> 17:36.383
but if she's gonna be with somebody,

17:36.417 --> 17:37.584
I'd like it to be you.

17:37.602 --> 17:39.302
Strange, but sweet.

17:39.353 --> 17:41.388
Only I didn't really die.
I was faking it.

17:41.422 --> 17:43.273
And I come back.

17:43.307 --> 17:46.309
I spy on you from my red Corvette.

17:46.360 --> 17:47.527
And I'm planning to kick your ass,

17:47.562 --> 17:49.429
but I see how happy you make her,

17:49.447 --> 17:50.564
and I have to walk away.

17:50.598 --> 17:52.649
I have to.
And I do, slowly.

17:52.700 --> 17:53.900
In a rainstorm.

17:53.934 --> 17:54.985
Okay, this isn't really in the spirit

17:55.036 --> 17:56.153
of what we're trying to do.

17:56.204 --> 17:58.989
But as time goes by,
it eats away at me.

17:59.040 --> 18:00.574
You're out living it up with my wife.

18:00.608 --> 18:02.375
And I'm alone.

18:02.410 --> 18:04.744
In a cave.

18:04.778 --> 18:06.613
Training.

18:06.631 --> 18:08.448
Anyone else want to chime in?

18:08.466 --> 18:09.782
I thought you were my friend.

18:09.800 --> 18:11.168
I thought you were my friend!

18:11.219 --> 18:12.952
Okay, what we're trying to say is

18:12.970 --> 18:14.221
that you are a great guy,

18:14.255 --> 18:16.590
and someday, you're gonna meet somebody

18:16.624 --> 18:19.125
who's into all the same stuff
that you are.

18:19.143 --> 18:21.511
You know, the old Chris would've loved

18:21.562 --> 18:24.648
this super-fit
health goddess

18:24.682 --> 18:25.765
you guys are talking about.

18:25.799 --> 18:28.185
But our great adventure reminded me

18:28.236 --> 18:30.187
that now I just want someone
that values

18:30.238 --> 18:31.404
the important things
in life--

18:31.439 --> 18:33.940
friendships, passion, happiness.

18:33.974 --> 18:36.243
And dimples are a plus.

18:36.277 --> 18:37.861
Aw, that's sweet.

18:37.912 --> 18:40.530
I forgive you, bro.
You take care of April.

18:40.581 --> 18:42.582
After careful examination,

18:42.617 --> 18:45.418
we have determined that
these Wamapoke artifacts

18:45.453 --> 18:47.754
could not have originated in lot 48.

18:48.288 --> 18:49.539
Boom.
Knew it.

18:49.590 --> 18:51.591
There's something else.

18:51.626 --> 18:53.126
I would like to go
on record and say that--

18:53.160 --> 18:54.211
Hold on, Ms. Knope.

18:54.262 --> 18:56.162
Please.

18:56.180 --> 18:57.597
I would like to go on record.

18:57.632 --> 18:59.332
Speaking as a citizen of Pawnee,

18:59.350 --> 19:01.101
I do not like the way
you went back on your deal

19:01.135 --> 19:02.936
with Councilwoman Knope.

19:02.970 --> 19:05.222
It reminds me of what
the settlers of Pawnee did

19:05.273 --> 19:06.339
to my ancestors,

19:06.357 --> 19:09.690
taking their land without permission.

19:10.444 --> 19:12.312
He really plays white people
like a fiddle.

19:13.046 --> 19:14.030
Wow.

19:14.065 --> 19:15.398
It's amazing to watch.

19:15.449 --> 19:16.783
You and Leslie had a deal.

19:16.817 --> 19:18.902
If that deal is not restored,

19:18.953 --> 19:22.286
well, I believe
there are six Paunch Burgers

19:22.456 --> 19:23.623
in the Wamapoke casino.

19:23.658 --> 19:26.409
Perhaps it's time that we revisited

19:26.710 --> 19:27.410
those contracts.

19:27.711 --> 19:30.297
Is that a threat?

19:30.581 --> 19:33.664
Why, yes, I--
I thought that was obvious.

19:34.335 --> 19:35.719
Take the sign down.

19:35.753 --> 19:37.304
We'll wait until everything's official.

19:37.338 --> 19:38.922
In the spirit of fair play,

19:38.973 --> 19:42.306
I suggest we put on these
authentic Wamapoke headdresses

19:42.560 --> 19:44.144
and dance around the table.

19:44.178 --> 19:45.745
Absolutely not.

19:45.763 --> 19:47.881
That sounds highly offensive.

19:47.915 --> 19:49.516
Does it, white man?

19:49.950 --> 19:52.085
No.
It's not offensive.

19:52.103 --> 19:55.138
- So let's do it.
- You first.

19:55.189 --> 19:57.857
So clearly, this is not offensive.

19:57.892 --> 19:59.059
It is offensive.

19:59.093 --> 20:01.645
- I am very sorry.
- Take it off.

20:01.696 --> 20:03.396
Hey, Wyatt.

20:03.430 --> 20:04.864
Oh, hey, Shauna.

20:04.899 --> 20:05.865
So I was chasing this story,

20:05.900 --> 20:07.200
but it seems like a dead end.

20:07.234 --> 20:10.487
Then I heard about your crazy
rotating bachelor party.

20:10.538 --> 20:11.738
Would you mind if I wrote about it?

20:11.772 --> 20:13.290
Sure.

20:13.324 --> 20:14.991
But is that really news?

20:15.042 --> 20:16.076
To me it is.

20:16.110 --> 20:17.711
A group of good friends having fun,

20:17.745 --> 20:18.912
doing nice things for each other.

20:18.946 --> 20:20.664
I mean, that's what's important
in life,

20:20.715 --> 20:22.549
and I want to write about it.

20:22.583 --> 20:23.950
Hey, Chris.

20:23.968 --> 20:24.968
Ben Wyatt.

20:25.002 --> 20:26.836
And Shauna Malwae-Tweep.

20:26.887 --> 20:28.121
Hey, Shauna's doing a story

20:28.139 --> 20:29.839
on our group bachelor party.

20:29.890 --> 20:31.124
She said she wanted to write stories

20:31.142 --> 20:33.843
about good people doing
nice things for each other.

20:33.894 --> 20:36.763
So I figured you two might have
a lot to talk about.

20:36.797 --> 20:39.049
You may be right about that.

20:39.083 --> 20:41.568
Do you have a second right now?

20:41.602 --> 20:43.103
I have thousands of seconds.

20:43.137 --> 20:44.571
Would you like to have lunch?

20:44.605 --> 20:46.106
Are you a vegetarian?

20:46.140 --> 20:48.274
A vegan?
A pescatarian?

20:48.308 --> 20:49.409
Not that it matters.

20:49.443 --> 20:52.162
- Um, I like burgers.
- Perfect.

20:53.355 --> 20:54.789
Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh!

20:55.573 --> 20:58.074
Three, ten, bullock!
Three, ten, bullock!

20:58.342 --> 20:59.927
Give it to me.

21:00.961 --> 21:02.082
How great a day was today?

21:02.096 --> 21:03.963
Oh, God, I could die.

21:03.997 --> 21:05.331
Greatest day of my life.

21:05.349 --> 21:06.633
I met Andrew Luck today.

21:06.667 --> 21:07.801
I met Reggie Wayne today.

21:07.835 --> 21:09.168
And I met Jim Irsay.

21:09.186 --> 21:12.055
I'm standing on the field.

21:12.106 --> 21:13.172
Lucas Oil Stadium.

21:13.190 --> 21:15.725
And I'm playing football
with my friends.
