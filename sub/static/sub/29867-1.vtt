00:28.463 --> 00:29.725
♪ "La, la, la, la"

00:57.840 --> 00:59.102
Hey!

00:59.146 --> 01:01.713
I was just
Photoshopping you. Wes.

01:01.757 --> 01:03.628
Oh, not that Christmas card
thing again.

01:03.672 --> 01:04.890
Well, I could
Photoshop you out.

01:04.934 --> 01:06.196
Can you?

01:06.240 --> 01:07.937
Look, I know you're not
a big "holiday" guy,

01:07.980 --> 01:10.026
but it's just a picture.

01:11.158 --> 01:12.811
With a wreath...

01:12.855 --> 01:15.292
and some mistletoe.

01:15.336 --> 01:17.642
And maybe even a snow globe.

01:17.686 --> 01:18.774
-Jessica...
-Okay, fine.

01:18.817 --> 01:20.297
No snow globe.

01:20.341 --> 01:21.864
You want
to grab drinks tonight?

01:21.907 --> 01:22.821
Sure.

01:22.865 --> 01:23.953
I'll text you.

01:23.996 --> 01:25.955
Okay. Bye.

01:45.627 --> 01:47.368
Merry Christmas.

01:55.419 --> 01:56.638
You want the moon?

01:56.681 --> 01:58.118
Just say the word

01:58.161 --> 01:59.336
and I'll throw a lasso
around it

01:59.380 --> 02:00.729
and pull it down.

02:00.772 --> 02:02.165
Let me guess.

02:02.209 --> 02:03.688
It's a Wonderful Life?

02:03.732 --> 02:05.299
You caught me, Jess.

02:05.342 --> 02:06.735
"You want the moon?"

02:06.778 --> 02:08.171
"Just say the word

02:08.215 --> 02:10.695
and I'll throw a lasso
around it and pull it down."

02:10.739 --> 02:12.132
Never gets old.

02:12.175 --> 02:13.350
'Cause you're a romantic.

02:13.394 --> 02:14.786
Not really.

02:14.830 --> 02:17.615
I mean, who's gonna give
someone the moon, right?

02:17.659 --> 02:19.182
You never know.

02:19.226 --> 02:20.488
Yeah, I kinda do.

02:22.229 --> 02:23.882
Wow, Joe.

02:23.926 --> 02:25.841
I've never seen these before.

02:29.192 --> 02:31.151
I thought you were
sending out photos this year.

02:31.194 --> 02:32.282
Oh, I am.

02:32.326 --> 02:34.589
But these are for the guy
in the photos.

02:34.632 --> 02:36.199
Can I get a hot cocoa
today, Joe?

02:36.243 --> 02:37.809
Extra marshmallows?

02:37.853 --> 02:38.984
You know it.

02:39.028 --> 02:40.856
-Coming right up.
-Thank you.

02:44.729 --> 02:46.818
-Oh! Sorry.
-It's okay.

02:52.781 --> 02:55.305
Morning, Mims.

02:55.349 --> 02:56.611
More decorations?

02:56.654 --> 02:59.483
You can never have
enough Christmas.

02:59.527 --> 03:00.397
Speaking of
"enough Christmas"--

03:00.441 --> 03:02.356
how's Dr. Handsome?

03:02.399 --> 03:03.835
Still "Bah, humbug,"

03:03.879 --> 03:05.228
and still not a doctor.

03:05.272 --> 03:06.360
He's an eye doctor.

03:06.403 --> 03:09.276
That's an optometrist.
He's an optician.

03:09.319 --> 03:11.234
An optometrist
goes to med school.

03:11.278 --> 03:12.627
He fits people for glasses,

03:12.670 --> 03:15.369
which is important
if you can't see.

03:15.412 --> 03:18.285
Anyhow, yes, I have
a few plans lined up.

03:18.328 --> 03:20.330
A "Jessica Christmas"?

03:20.374 --> 03:21.897
No. But...

03:21.940 --> 03:24.465
I bought him these five cards.

03:24.508 --> 03:26.597
I'm gonna send him one
every day this week.

03:26.641 --> 03:29.557
I think that will get him
into the spirit, right?

03:29.600 --> 03:32.299
I mean, who doesn't love
opening a Christmas card?

03:32.342 --> 03:34.475
I approve.

03:34.518 --> 03:37.217
And then we're gonna go
caroling on Wednesday.

03:37.260 --> 03:39.001
Followed by ice skating
on Thursday,

03:39.044 --> 03:41.308
leading up to Christmas Eve
at Aunt Lila's.

03:43.875 --> 03:45.094
Too much?

03:45.137 --> 03:46.878
How about you
just stick with the cards?

03:48.445 --> 03:49.664
But aren't these cute?

03:49.707 --> 03:51.100
They're so cute.

03:52.536 --> 03:53.624
Oh, hey, Ruth.

03:53.668 --> 03:55.713
How's the recorder coming,
Joshua?

03:55.757 --> 03:57.541
He wants to try
a new instrument for Christmas.

03:57.585 --> 03:59.151
Guitar.

03:59.195 --> 04:01.153
Ahh... ladies love
a guitar player.

04:01.197 --> 04:02.329
But I keep telling him

04:02.372 --> 04:03.765
the violin looks better
on college apps.

04:03.808 --> 04:05.157
Well, there is always that,

04:05.201 --> 04:08.073
but sometimes the instrument
picks the musician.

04:08.117 --> 04:08.987
What do you play?

04:09.031 --> 04:10.859
I play the cello.

04:10.902 --> 04:12.730
That's the really big
one, right?

04:12.774 --> 04:14.123
Mm-hmm. That's actually
why I picked it at first.

04:14.166 --> 04:15.907
I had a really mean
bus driver

04:15.951 --> 04:17.822
and it took up two seats.

04:17.866 --> 04:19.520
But turns out,
I ended up loving with it.

04:19.563 --> 04:21.173
Go ahead and look around.

04:21.217 --> 04:25.569
Seeing as we're on the subject
of your love of the cello,

04:25.613 --> 04:27.267
did I mention my cousin

04:27.310 --> 04:29.356
at the Chicago Heritage
Orchestra called?

04:29.399 --> 04:30.705
Or maybe I called him.

04:30.748 --> 04:32.010
Mimi.

04:32.054 --> 04:33.708
Turns out one of
their cello players just left.

04:33.751 --> 04:35.666
What a shame.

04:35.710 --> 04:37.102
Just let me
get you an audition.

04:37.146 --> 04:38.843
I am way out of practice.

04:38.887 --> 04:40.715
So, practice.

04:40.758 --> 04:42.325
I just...

04:42.369 --> 04:44.414
Maybe another time.

04:47.374 --> 04:50.159
That's a really great
starter guitar.

04:50.202 --> 04:51.334
You like it?

04:51.378 --> 04:52.553
-Yeah.
-Looks cool.

04:52.596 --> 04:53.597
Joshua?

04:58.167 --> 05:00.343
Thank you so much.

05:00.387 --> 05:01.649
He'll love it.

05:02.780 --> 05:04.565
Bye, guys.

05:04.608 --> 05:06.175
Merry Christmas.

05:06.218 --> 05:08.612
They'll be back for a guitar
before the new year, trust me.

05:11.615 --> 05:13.443
Dr. Handsome?

05:13.487 --> 05:15.750
We're having drinks tonight,
at Primo's.

05:15.793 --> 05:16.838
Primo's?

05:16.881 --> 05:18.274
"The Proposal Palace"?

05:18.318 --> 05:19.797
It's near his office.

05:19.841 --> 05:21.321
Do you know how many couples
get engaged at Primo's?

05:21.364 --> 05:23.279
He's not proposing.
It's only been three months.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.326
Remember him?

05:28.328 --> 05:30.112
Mm... mm!

05:30.155 --> 05:31.200
Cute.

05:31.243 --> 05:32.680
Mm. Very cute.

05:38.425 --> 05:40.340
Wake up, Sunshine.

05:42.298 --> 05:44.387
Hey, you didn't, uh,

05:44.431 --> 05:46.781
happen to bring me
an espresso, did you?

05:46.824 --> 05:48.870
That's a little
out of my job description.

05:48.913 --> 05:50.001
You're my manager.

05:50.045 --> 05:50.959
Also your brother.

05:51.002 --> 05:52.352
Get up.

05:54.049 --> 05:55.746
So, you ready
for that Christmas gig?

05:55.790 --> 05:57.357
What Christmas gig?

05:57.400 --> 05:59.533
You know how hard I had to work
to get you that spot?

05:59.576 --> 06:01.622
I'm opening
for a 12-year-old.

06:01.665 --> 06:03.363
He should be at home
with his parents.

06:03.406 --> 06:05.452
He's 17
and he has 50 million followers.

06:05.495 --> 06:07.454
When did "fans"
become "followers"?

06:07.497 --> 06:09.499
Oh, let's see, about the time
that you split up the band?

06:10.761 --> 06:12.502
I'm not sure I want
people following me.

06:12.546 --> 06:14.591
I'm not sure
I want to get up there

06:14.635 --> 06:16.071
and sing that song.

06:16.114 --> 06:17.072
People love that song again.

06:17.115 --> 06:18.508
You are that song.

06:18.552 --> 06:20.249
Unless, of course,
you want to write a new one.

06:21.511 --> 06:23.818
"Luv U On Christmas" it is.

06:23.861 --> 06:25.863
I thought so.

06:25.907 --> 06:27.909
Oh, maybe that
will inspire you.

06:30.433 --> 06:32.392
I like their candy canes,
don't you?

06:34.263 --> 06:35.873
You know what I love?

06:35.917 --> 06:36.918
Crosswords.

06:40.312 --> 06:43.272
♪ Christmas is here...

06:43.315 --> 06:45.840
No, not Jax, please.

06:45.883 --> 06:47.450
Hey, can someone urn that off?

06:47.494 --> 06:49.278
Hey, uh...

06:49.321 --> 06:50.714
Private Carter Winthrop?

06:50.758 --> 06:51.759
Oh, uh...

06:53.674 --> 06:55.023
Um, I thought you were...

06:55.066 --> 06:56.894
Just...

06:58.374 --> 07:00.332
Yeah, it's not that
I don't like Christmas music.

07:00.376 --> 07:02.465
It's just not that.
Uh, my sister, she--

07:02.509 --> 07:04.293
Can you sign, please?

07:04.336 --> 07:05.425
Sure. Yeah.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.253
Uh...

07:09.646 --> 07:11.039
Sorry.

07:13.520 --> 07:14.695
Uh...

07:16.436 --> 07:18.655
Yeah, I'm-I'm making it...
making it worse.

07:18.699 --> 07:20.309
Here's your alternators.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.314
Think I can alternate
the last two minutes?

07:26.533 --> 07:28.143
Not unless you have
a time machine.

07:30.885 --> 07:32.582
Merry Christmas.

07:34.845 --> 07:37.021
Smooth.

07:37.065 --> 07:38.501
You saw that?

07:38.545 --> 07:40.895
Just tell her you like her.

07:40.938 --> 07:43.158
What's the point?
Shipping out in two weeks.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.117
She's here now,
you're here now.

07:46.161 --> 07:47.684
Seize the moment!

07:47.728 --> 07:49.294
Pretty sure
I just blew the moment.

07:58.869 --> 08:01.132
Good morning, CJ.

08:13.971 --> 08:16.757
Good morning, Jessica.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.149
Morning, Auntie Lila.

08:18.193 --> 08:19.411
Honey, you don't need

08:19.455 --> 08:21.544
to check in on me every day.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.372
Although I appreciate it.

08:23.415 --> 08:24.982
I know it's gonna be

08:25.026 --> 08:26.157
a quiet Christmas this year
with Carter away,

08:26.201 --> 08:27.942
but I am bringing Wes.

08:27.985 --> 08:28.943
You asked him?

08:28.986 --> 08:30.553
Almost.

08:30.597 --> 08:32.163
Did you get your tree yet?

08:33.687 --> 08:35.732
I think
I'm gonna skip it this year.

08:35.776 --> 08:37.821
But you are making
your famous fruitcake, right?

08:37.865 --> 08:39.214
Working on it!

08:39.257 --> 08:40.781
Sure.

08:40.824 --> 08:42.783
Honey, don't worry about me.
In fact, I'm just on my way out.

08:42.826 --> 08:44.567
13 shopping days, right?

08:44.611 --> 08:46.264
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

08:46.308 --> 08:47.352
Bye.

09:17.034 --> 09:18.427
Let's do the proposal.

09:18.470 --> 09:20.255
Ahem.

09:20.298 --> 09:22.126
Oh, honey, you were
on the other knee.

09:22.170 --> 09:24.041
Who's gonna know?

09:24.085 --> 09:25.521
This is our place.

09:25.565 --> 09:26.696
I want to look back
on this moment

09:26.740 --> 09:28.872
and remember exactly
how you asked me.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.702
And now look into
each other's eyes

09:32.746 --> 09:36.314
as if you are the only
two people in the entire world

09:36.358 --> 09:37.664
on Christmas.

09:39.796 --> 09:41.711
Or at least
in the restaurant.

09:44.148 --> 09:45.367
All right!

09:45.410 --> 09:46.716
I got it.

09:48.675 --> 09:50.981
They're perfect.

09:51.025 --> 09:52.766
All right.
I'm glad you're happy.

09:54.332 --> 09:55.551
Oh, Luke...

09:55.595 --> 09:58.249
are you
in a relationship?

09:58.293 --> 09:59.599
Uh, no.

09:59.642 --> 10:01.209
Great. I'd really love
to introduce you

10:01.252 --> 10:03.037
to one of my bridesmaids.

10:03.080 --> 10:05.213
Uh, thanks. I just--
I don't like to mix work--

10:05.256 --> 10:06.170
She's amazing.

10:06.214 --> 10:08.042
I'm sure she is,
but...

10:08.085 --> 10:10.218
I mean, I want to be focused
on your wedding--

10:10.261 --> 10:12.002
You can meet her
before the wedding.

10:12.046 --> 10:13.743
I have a really good
feeling about this.

10:13.787 --> 10:16.616
So what is better for you,
tomorrow or the day after?

10:16.659 --> 10:18.705
Do you know what?
I'll just text you her info.

10:18.748 --> 10:20.402
You're gonna love her.

10:20.445 --> 10:21.838
I have a good feeling!

10:21.882 --> 10:24.754
-Thanks, Luke.
-Thanks, Luke.

10:28.192 --> 10:30.281
What just happened?

10:35.504 --> 10:37.680
Hey, Luke.
So, I, uh...

10:38.725 --> 10:41.597
Taking pictures
of ornaments now?

10:42.729 --> 10:45.427
I, uh, need this room.

10:45.470 --> 10:47.081
Yeah, for the customers.

10:47.124 --> 10:49.692
Right. I'm on my way.

10:49.736 --> 10:50.867
I owe you, Primo.

10:50.911 --> 10:52.129
Yes. Yes, you do.

10:52.173 --> 10:54.697
You... get to be Santa.

10:54.741 --> 10:56.699
I'm Santa every year, Primo.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.135
That's at Saint Mary's,

10:58.179 --> 10:59.789
but you also get to be Santa
at my nephew's birthday.

10:59.833 --> 11:01.269
9:00 a.m.

11:01.312 --> 11:03.619
Sharp.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.621
I want you to take good care
of these guys.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.101
They're here
for their anniversary.

11:07.144 --> 11:08.232
Okay?

11:08.276 --> 11:09.669
Thanks again, Primo.

11:09.712 --> 11:11.018
-See you tomorrow.
-See you tomorrow.

11:11.061 --> 11:12.106
9:00 a.m.!

11:12.149 --> 11:13.542
Thank you.

11:16.197 --> 11:17.981
Make sure
they have a great time

11:18.025 --> 11:19.026
and we'll get their next party.

11:41.048 --> 11:42.092
Sorry I'm late.

11:42.136 --> 11:44.051
Oh.

11:45.313 --> 11:46.749
It's "National Eye Exam" Day.

11:46.793 --> 11:47.663
Oh!

11:47.707 --> 11:49.360
Merry...

11:49.404 --> 11:51.667
C-H-R-I-S...

11:52.799 --> 11:54.801
I'm sorry.

11:54.844 --> 11:57.064
Am I'm making a "spectacle"
of myself?

11:59.980 --> 12:02.373
Ahh. So, uh...
Christmas shopping?

12:02.417 --> 12:03.853
Not exactly.

12:05.115 --> 12:07.814
Well, if you're wondering
about what to get me...

12:07.857 --> 12:09.903
"You can just get me
the moon, George Bailey."

12:11.992 --> 12:13.689
It's a Wonderful Life?

12:13.733 --> 12:15.560
-The movie?
-Oh, I didn't see it.

12:15.604 --> 12:17.998
Would you like
to see a menu, Dr. Dade?

12:18.041 --> 12:20.217
Can you give us a minute?

12:21.349 --> 12:22.611
Uh...

12:23.743 --> 12:25.266
Cheers.

12:26.528 --> 12:27.485
So...

12:27.529 --> 12:28.617
So.

12:28.660 --> 12:30.880
Holidays are closing in.

12:30.924 --> 12:32.360
Look, I know you think
I'm overdoing it,

12:32.403 --> 12:34.231
with the traditions
and the plans,

12:34.275 --> 12:36.799
but just... Christmas has always
been so special to me.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.061
And this year,

12:38.105 --> 12:39.889
with my brother away
and my aunt being alone,

12:39.933 --> 12:42.892
I just really want to keep
that spirit alive.

12:42.936 --> 12:44.372
I know,

12:44.415 --> 12:46.591
which is kind of why
I wanted to do this now.

12:51.596 --> 12:53.381
Jessica...

12:53.424 --> 12:55.426
we've been seeing each other
for three months.

12:55.470 --> 12:56.732
-Mm-hmm.
-And what do they say?

12:56.776 --> 12:59.691
It takes three months
to get to know somebody.

12:59.735 --> 13:00.867
I've never heard that.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.825
The thing is...

13:02.869 --> 13:05.915
what,
we've had 20, 25 dates?

13:05.959 --> 13:09.266
Not counting the phone calls,
the texts, the emails...

13:09.310 --> 13:12.356
I think I know
all I need to know

13:12.400 --> 13:15.055
for what I'm about
to say.

13:15.098 --> 13:16.099
Jessica...

13:16.143 --> 13:17.840
No!

13:17.884 --> 13:20.016
I mean, maybe.
It's too soon.

13:20.060 --> 13:22.062
We haven't even said
"I love you" yet.

13:22.105 --> 13:24.281
I mean, not
that I couldn't love you.

13:24.325 --> 13:26.631
In time, but...
I mean, what if

13:26.675 --> 13:28.851
you are the one for me,
and I just don't know it yet?

13:28.895 --> 13:30.505
Oh, God.

13:33.029 --> 13:34.857
I was gonna say

13:34.901 --> 13:36.903
I think we should
stop seeing each other.

13:36.946 --> 13:38.121
What?

13:38.165 --> 13:39.775
I just-- I think
we've run our course,

13:39.819 --> 13:42.734
and I really need
to focus on my practice.

13:42.778 --> 13:43.866
You left these at my place.

13:43.910 --> 13:46.260
Oh.

13:49.698 --> 13:51.308
Are you ready
to order, Dr. Dade?

13:57.314 --> 13:59.664
You know,
he's not even a doctor.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.536
He makes bifocals.

14:01.579 --> 14:04.191
I am so... sorry.

14:08.195 --> 14:10.762
Who breaks up with someone
at "the Proposal Palace"?

14:10.806 --> 14:13.591
I am so humiliated.

14:13.635 --> 14:15.202
And right before Christmas?

14:15.245 --> 14:17.595
I don't want to marry him.

14:17.639 --> 14:19.032
Of course you don't.

14:19.075 --> 14:21.208
I don't even think
I liked him that much.

14:21.251 --> 14:22.905
I never liked him.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.559
Why didn't you say anything?

14:24.602 --> 14:25.777
Would you have listened?

14:25.821 --> 14:27.562
No.

14:29.129 --> 14:31.392
Sweetie...

14:31.435 --> 14:32.915
this is what you do--

14:32.959 --> 14:34.090
you pick the same stuffed shirts

14:34.134 --> 14:35.613
that you're never
gonna really fall for,

14:35.657 --> 14:37.964
and when it ends,
well...

14:38.007 --> 14:39.748
you don't feel anything.

14:39.791 --> 14:41.054
I feel stupid.

14:41.097 --> 14:43.621
And tomorrow
you're gonna feel relieved.

14:47.147 --> 14:49.192
You've been through a lot.

14:49.236 --> 14:51.238
Who hasn't?

14:51.281 --> 14:53.849
You lost your parents.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.372
Jess...

14:55.416 --> 14:57.244
you were so young.

14:58.506 --> 14:59.855
That changes everything.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.248
I know.

15:02.945 --> 15:04.947
But you can't keep
picking the wrong guys

15:04.991 --> 15:06.862
just to avoid feeling hurt.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.820
One day, the right one's
gonna come along

15:08.864 --> 15:10.779
and he's gonna be
worth the risk.

15:12.259 --> 15:13.651
Or...

15:13.695 --> 15:15.697
I just stop.

15:15.740 --> 15:17.394
Stop what?

15:17.438 --> 15:18.613
All of it.

15:18.656 --> 15:21.964
Yeah, I-I'm taking a holiday
from dating.

15:22.008 --> 15:23.139
And while I'm at it,

15:23.183 --> 15:24.749
I'm taking a holiday
from the holidays.

15:26.012 --> 15:27.970
That's ridiculous.

15:28.014 --> 15:29.406
No. This year,

15:29.450 --> 15:30.842
Christmas will just be
another day on the calendar,

15:30.886 --> 15:32.540
between Thanksgiving
and New Year's.

15:32.583 --> 15:35.325
You'll spend Christmas with us
and John's parents in Michigan.

15:35.369 --> 15:37.284
Auntie Lila, too.

15:37.327 --> 15:38.720
Thank you,

15:38.763 --> 15:40.374
but she doesn't want
to celebrate this year either.

15:40.417 --> 15:44.117
We are fine right here--
just the two of us.

15:50.036 --> 15:51.472
I feel better already.

15:53.169 --> 15:54.954
It's open.

15:57.652 --> 15:59.262
Hi, honey.

15:59.306 --> 16:01.134
-Hi, Jess.
-Hey.

16:01.177 --> 16:03.266
-Merry Christmas.
-Is it?

16:06.574 --> 16:07.879
This was outside the door.

16:07.923 --> 16:09.664
Oh. Thanks.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.001
"Jessica,

16:42.044 --> 16:43.480
we're so proud

16:43.524 --> 16:45.961
of the amazing young woman
you have become.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.877
Love Uncle CJ and Aunt Lila."

16:50.009 --> 16:51.619
"Dear Jessica,

16:51.662 --> 16:54.056
for always knowing
how to put a smile on my face.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.971
We will be friends forever.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.538
Love Mimi."

16:57.581 --> 16:58.452
"You're the best sister

16:58.495 --> 16:59.888
a guy could ask for.

16:59.931 --> 17:00.845
Thanks for always
being there for me.

17:00.889 --> 17:02.195
Love Carter."

17:26.915 --> 17:29.526
"Dearest Lug Nut...

17:31.659 --> 17:34.444
I bought these...

17:34.488 --> 17:37.056
for someone else...

17:38.622 --> 17:40.233
...But now I think
they were for me."

17:58.860 --> 18:01.689
♪ Fa, la, la, la, la
la, la, la, la ♪

18:14.702 --> 18:15.877
Aww! Yeah.

18:17.183 --> 18:19.228
And Merry Christmas.

18:19.272 --> 18:20.882
Thanks.

18:20.925 --> 18:23.450
There's that look again.

18:23.493 --> 18:24.712
What look?

18:24.755 --> 18:27.106
The one you get
every time you see a baby.

18:27.149 --> 18:29.499
Don't you think
you should talk to John?

18:29.543 --> 18:31.110
We agreed we'd wait.

18:31.153 --> 18:33.112
You also agreed

18:33.155 --> 18:34.852
that you'd work out every day
and only eat egg whites.

18:34.896 --> 18:36.985
Okay, that was unrealistic.

18:37.028 --> 18:38.943
Yeah!

18:38.987 --> 18:40.771
Are you really gonna wait
another three years?

18:41.903 --> 18:43.818
2.9 years.

18:43.861 --> 18:46.081
Okay.

18:47.300 --> 18:48.736
Did you get me a card?

18:48.779 --> 18:50.433
Maybe.

18:54.307 --> 18:55.656
It's so cute.

18:58.485 --> 19:01.792
"Merry Christmas
to my best friend...

19:01.836 --> 19:04.012
who's always there,

19:04.055 --> 19:06.101
in good times and bad.

19:06.145 --> 19:09.017
And who always
tells me the truth."

19:10.105 --> 19:11.628
And I always will.

19:11.672 --> 19:13.630
Me too.

19:16.938 --> 19:19.158
And right now the truth is

19:19.201 --> 19:20.855
I have something for you.

19:20.898 --> 19:21.725
What? We said no presents.

19:21.769 --> 19:22.900
It's not a present.

19:22.944 --> 19:24.293
It's an audition.
I called my cousin.

19:24.337 --> 19:25.773
No.

19:25.816 --> 19:27.253
Day before Christmas.

19:27.296 --> 19:29.211
And since you were jilted,
you're completely available.

19:29.255 --> 19:31.518
Mimi... no.

19:31.561 --> 19:32.954
No more excuses.

19:32.997 --> 19:34.869
I told you,
I am out of practice.

19:34.912 --> 19:35.913
You have all week.

19:35.957 --> 19:37.437
What's the worst
that could happen?

19:37.480 --> 19:41.005
Uh, I humiliate myself
in front of the Heritage?

19:41.049 --> 19:43.051
And who hasn't done that
once or twice?

19:47.403 --> 19:49.536
Change. Change.

19:53.279 --> 19:54.671
You're getting slow
in your old age.

19:55.933 --> 19:57.500
So, blind date, huh?

19:57.544 --> 19:59.676
I thought
you swore off those things.

19:59.720 --> 20:01.765
I got roped in.

20:01.809 --> 20:03.463
She's a bridesmaid
at that wedding I'm shooting.

20:03.506 --> 20:05.769
Ah. What time?

20:05.813 --> 20:07.467
Coffee, 10:00.

20:07.510 --> 20:09.599
So, what,
you'll be done at, uh...

20:09.643 --> 20:10.557
what, 10:05?

20:12.123 --> 20:13.560
I'm just saying.

20:13.603 --> 20:15.083
You haven't been in
a real relationship in a while.

20:15.126 --> 20:17.651
And, uh, by "a while,"
I mean...

20:17.694 --> 20:18.782
years.

20:20.306 --> 20:21.916
Let's go, let's go!

20:21.959 --> 20:23.744
Well, maybe I'm waiting
for the right one.

20:23.787 --> 20:26.181
Right one? How would you know?
You never give anyone a chance.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.096
I gave someone a chance--
three years of my life.

20:28.139 --> 20:29.924
So you grew apart.
It happens.

20:29.967 --> 20:32.274
She left me at the altar,
Primo. Remember?

20:32.318 --> 20:35.234
Remind me again--
you still single?

20:36.539 --> 20:38.237
No, I'm not.
I'm married to a restaurant.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.194
Remember?

20:40.369 --> 20:42.763
And we have
a very good relationship!

20:49.335 --> 20:50.597
--understood you.

20:50.640 --> 20:51.685
I loved you.

20:53.034 --> 20:54.253
How could you do this to me?

20:56.472 --> 20:58.213
-I loved you.
-Leslie?

20:58.257 --> 21:00.302
Luke?

21:00.346 --> 21:02.043
Am I interrupting?

21:02.086 --> 21:04.524
No, I was just running lines.

21:04.567 --> 21:06.090
Phew.

21:06.134 --> 21:08.179
I have a really big
audition later.

21:08.223 --> 21:10.051
-You're an actress?
-Yeah.

21:10.094 --> 21:11.966
And you're
a wedding photographer.

21:13.184 --> 21:14.751
Uh, more than just weddings.

21:14.795 --> 21:15.796
Headshots?

21:15.839 --> 21:17.624
Sometimes.

21:17.667 --> 21:18.799
Well, look at this...

21:20.366 --> 21:21.628
It's awful, right?

21:22.672 --> 21:24.631
No. I think you look great.

21:24.674 --> 21:26.850
But you could do better.

21:26.894 --> 21:27.721
I saw the proposal pictures.

21:27.764 --> 21:28.809
Amazing!

21:28.852 --> 21:30.245
Thank you.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.421
Maybe you could do
my new headshots?

21:32.465 --> 21:34.641
Uh, sure.

21:34.684 --> 21:35.685
Yeah, uh...

21:35.729 --> 21:37.470
What can I get you?

21:37.513 --> 21:40.386
I'll have a latte,
the Christmas Blend.

21:40.429 --> 21:41.778
That's a good choice.

21:41.822 --> 21:43.563
You know what?
Make that two, please.

21:43.606 --> 21:45.521
Thank you.

21:45.565 --> 21:47.610
I love blind dates.

21:47.654 --> 21:49.395
Even if it's bad,

21:49.438 --> 21:51.788
something good can still
come out of it, right?

21:51.832 --> 21:54.313
Uh, I've pretty much had
the opposite experience.

21:54.356 --> 21:56.315
You on any dating apps?

21:56.358 --> 21:57.968
No! No, no, no, no. No.

21:58.012 --> 22:00.362
I like to think of myself
as a man of fate.

22:00.406 --> 22:03.191
You mean, like, locking eyes
across a crowded room?

22:03.234 --> 22:04.627
Something like that, yeah.

22:08.239 --> 22:09.937
Could you do me a big favor?

22:09.980 --> 22:11.242
Would you mind

22:11.286 --> 22:12.635
reading this with me
before our drinks come?

22:12.679 --> 22:14.158
Oh, no, I'm not an actor.

22:14.202 --> 22:15.638
It's only one page.

22:15.682 --> 22:18.206
I'm just so nervous
about this audition.

22:20.600 --> 22:21.557
Sure.

22:21.601 --> 22:24.865
You're Mike and I'm Claire.

22:26.388 --> 22:27.694
I'm Mike...

22:27.737 --> 22:30.436
"Mike." Okay.

22:30.479 --> 22:32.089
Uh...

22:32.133 --> 22:35.136
Claire, I can explain.

22:36.616 --> 22:38.966
How could you do this to me?

22:39.009 --> 22:40.533
I trusted you!

22:41.621 --> 22:42.752
I loved you!

22:42.796 --> 22:43.971
Uh--

22:44.014 --> 22:44.928
It's not what you think.

22:44.972 --> 22:47.148
You make me sick!

22:51.587 --> 22:53.502
Do you want this to go?

22:54.721 --> 22:56.462
Yeah.

23:24.751 --> 23:26.666
"Dear Mrs. Miller--

23:26.709 --> 23:28.232
Thank you for introducing me

23:28.276 --> 23:31.801
to the one lasting love
of my life, music.

23:31.845 --> 23:33.063
Merry Christmas.

23:33.107 --> 23:35.239
Love Jessica."

23:56.609 --> 23:58.219
Excuse me.
You dropped something.

24:02.049 --> 24:03.442
Thank you.

24:05.748 --> 24:08.142
Blitzen!

24:08.185 --> 24:10.100
Blitzen, come back here!
Oh, I'm so sorry.

24:10.144 --> 24:11.450
It's all right.
You can come in.

24:13.843 --> 24:14.975
Well, he's smart!

24:15.018 --> 24:17.978
He picked the best seat
in the house.

24:18.021 --> 24:20.241
Blitzen... oh, boy.

24:21.721 --> 24:23.287
Blitzen, huh?

24:23.331 --> 24:24.941
You're a little small
for a reindeer.

24:26.595 --> 24:27.596
How long have you had him?

24:27.640 --> 24:29.119
Oh, he's not mine.

24:29.163 --> 24:31.208
A friend of mine moved
and couldn't take him with him,

24:31.252 --> 24:34.037
so I'm trying to find him
his forever home.

24:34.081 --> 24:37.824
You know, I had a dog like you
when I was growing up.

24:37.867 --> 24:38.825
You're very handsome.

24:38.868 --> 24:39.608
Well, thank you.

24:41.001 --> 24:42.350
I'm sorry. Just...

24:43.830 --> 24:45.266
I'm Tom.

24:45.309 --> 24:46.485
Lila.

24:46.528 --> 24:48.182
Pleasure.

24:49.575 --> 24:50.663
I'll get him some water.

24:52.882 --> 24:55.450
Can I get you
a bowl of water, too?

24:56.669 --> 24:58.322
No, thank you.
I had one earlier.

24:58.366 --> 25:01.238
I'm, um, gonna take an ad out
after Christmas,

25:01.282 --> 25:04.067
but I haven't done
a good photo yet.

25:04.111 --> 25:05.982
Is that even a dog?

25:06.026 --> 25:09.420
I know.
He just wouldn't sit still.

25:09.464 --> 25:11.161
Blitzen, here's some water.

25:14.425 --> 25:16.427
Ah, "coffee for one."

25:16.471 --> 25:18.604
I got one of those
last Christmas from my daughter.

25:18.647 --> 25:20.257
Mine's from my niece.

25:20.301 --> 25:21.911
Apparently, they don't think
we can handle caffeine anymore.

25:21.955 --> 25:23.957
Who do they think they are?

25:24.000 --> 25:25.219
Even if they're right.

25:27.961 --> 25:29.571
So, do you live nearby?

25:29.615 --> 25:30.746
I'm over on Maple.

25:30.790 --> 25:32.443
Those new condos.

25:32.487 --> 25:34.271
I moved in
after my wife passed.

25:34.315 --> 25:35.838
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

25:35.882 --> 25:37.361
When did she pass?

25:37.405 --> 25:38.885
Around three years now.

25:40.626 --> 25:42.889
My husband passed
two years ago.

25:42.932 --> 25:44.717
I'm sorry, too, Lila.

25:47.850 --> 25:49.373
Well...

25:49.417 --> 25:51.114
it's been a pleasure
meeting you.

25:51.158 --> 25:52.376
You too, Tom.

25:54.030 --> 25:56.119
Happy holidays.
We will, um...

25:56.163 --> 25:57.251
We'll let ourselves out.

25:58.513 --> 26:00.254
-Come on.
-Bye, Blitzen!

26:13.049 --> 26:14.398
I've got this
for Private Winthrop.

26:19.665 --> 26:21.580
Merry Christmas, Jess.

26:21.623 --> 26:23.016
Let's see what we have
for you today.

26:24.452 --> 26:25.845
Hey.

26:25.888 --> 26:27.063
You again.

26:27.107 --> 26:28.543
You, uh, come here often?

26:28.587 --> 26:29.544
Every day.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.633
Right. Yeah. Uh, me too.

26:31.677 --> 26:33.592
Um...

26:33.635 --> 26:34.854
Got any plans for the holidays?

26:34.897 --> 26:35.985
Waiting for my orders.

26:36.029 --> 26:37.596
I'm heading to Germany.

26:37.639 --> 26:39.423
Did you know that gingerbread
is from Germany?

26:39.467 --> 26:40.773
Yeah, they call it,

26:40.816 --> 26:43.558
uh... lebkuchenplaetzchen.

26:44.907 --> 26:47.214
Anything for
Private Angie Dawson?

26:47.257 --> 26:48.563
Let me have a look here.

26:49.825 --> 26:50.826
No, sorry, Angie.

26:50.870 --> 26:52.567
Maybe try again tomorrow.

26:56.092 --> 26:57.050
Hey!

26:57.093 --> 26:58.573
Look.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.227
-I wanted to apologize.
-For what?

27:00.270 --> 27:02.490
Being a complete idiot
around you.

27:02.533 --> 27:04.753
Normally,
I am extremely charming.

27:04.797 --> 27:06.581
-Really?
-Okay, I'm somewhat charming.

27:07.669 --> 27:09.410
Cute card.

27:09.453 --> 27:11.499
Ah, yes, the snowman--
perfect guy.

27:11.542 --> 27:13.675
Well-rounded
and not afraid to carry a broom.

27:13.719 --> 27:15.546
-Who's it from?
-My sister.

27:15.590 --> 27:17.157
She's pretty amazing.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.506
You must be close.

27:18.549 --> 27:20.639
Yeah, she's kind of
been my rock-solid.

27:23.554 --> 27:25.252
Are you okay?

27:25.295 --> 27:27.123
Yeah.

27:27.167 --> 27:29.778
It's just my first Christmas
away from home.

27:29.822 --> 27:31.650
Mine too.

27:31.693 --> 27:34.087
You're lucky to have
family like that.

27:48.057 --> 27:49.189
Your social media manager

27:49.232 --> 27:51.974
says you should post
three times a day.

27:52.018 --> 27:53.106
I have
a social media manager?

27:53.149 --> 27:54.063
Yeah.

27:54.107 --> 27:55.674
Me.

27:55.717 --> 27:57.023
Whatever that is,
I don't want it.

27:59.590 --> 28:01.680
What's that?

28:04.552 --> 28:05.858
It's from a fan.

28:05.901 --> 28:07.424
You mean a follower?

28:07.468 --> 28:10.079
No. I don't mean a follower.

28:10.123 --> 28:11.472
Well, what's it say?

28:11.515 --> 28:13.561
I was "the soundtrack"
of her life.

28:14.867 --> 28:16.346
She says

28:16.390 --> 28:18.566
my music helped her get through
the loss of her parents.

28:22.048 --> 28:24.137
Your music helped me
get through a tough time, too.

28:25.486 --> 28:27.053
You never told me that.

28:27.096 --> 28:28.358
Should've.

28:38.368 --> 28:39.543
Merry Christmas, Daisy.

28:40.631 --> 28:41.807
Who's next?

28:41.850 --> 28:43.286
Billy...

28:43.330 --> 28:45.506
Oh, you're getting
so big, Billy.

28:45.549 --> 28:47.464
Now, tell me,

28:47.508 --> 28:49.553
what do you want
for Christmas?

28:51.120 --> 28:52.948
A giant Christmas tree!

28:52.992 --> 28:55.037
A giant Christmas tree, huh?

28:56.996 --> 28:58.780
Let me see what I can do.

28:58.824 --> 29:00.434
Deal? Deal.

29:01.565 --> 29:02.349
All right.

29:02.392 --> 29:03.393
Say "cheese."

29:32.727 --> 29:34.598
I've got pepper spray.

29:34.642 --> 29:36.470
Jessica Winthrop?

29:36.513 --> 29:37.950
Santa?

29:39.821 --> 29:41.214
Right...

29:41.257 --> 29:43.259
Uh, I'm coming from somewhere.

29:43.303 --> 29:44.739
The North Pole?

29:44.783 --> 29:45.740
North Side.

29:45.784 --> 29:46.828
Uh...

29:46.872 --> 29:49.657
You sent this to my mother.

29:49.700 --> 29:50.876
Your mother is Mrs. Miller?

29:50.919 --> 29:52.268
I usually just call her "Mom."

29:53.661 --> 29:54.793
She's in Kenya for a year,
teaching.

29:54.836 --> 29:56.577
Oh, that is so wonderful!

29:56.620 --> 29:59.319
It must seem crazy,
me writing to her,

29:59.362 --> 30:01.712
since I haven't seen her
since I was 10.

30:01.756 --> 30:03.671
Why don't you come in?

30:05.151 --> 30:07.588
You know, I don't think
sending a card is crazy at all.

30:07.631 --> 30:08.937
She did introduce you

30:08.981 --> 30:10.939
to the one lasting love
of your life...

30:10.983 --> 30:12.419
You read it?

30:12.462 --> 30:14.160
Okay, in my defense,
she asked me to open her mail.

30:14.203 --> 30:16.640
I read it to her
over the phone.

30:16.684 --> 30:17.946
Apparently,

30:17.990 --> 30:19.992
you were my mother's
most promising student.

30:20.035 --> 30:21.123
She remembered me?

30:21.167 --> 30:22.908
Even your nickname.

30:22.951 --> 30:24.735
Mm.
"Messy Jessie."

30:24.779 --> 30:25.780
Should I ask?

30:25.824 --> 30:27.086
Nope. You should not.

30:27.129 --> 30:29.392
Anyway, I just thought
you should know.

30:29.436 --> 30:30.741
It really touched her.

30:30.785 --> 30:32.918
Like what she did mattered,
you know?

30:34.180 --> 30:35.834
-Okay!
-Sorry.

30:35.877 --> 30:36.835
Let me give you a hand.

30:37.966 --> 30:38.924
Oh! Ow!

30:38.967 --> 30:40.403
Uh...

30:40.447 --> 30:42.623
I'm so sorry.
That was my fault.

30:42.666 --> 30:44.451
I have a really hard head.

30:44.494 --> 30:46.105
You really do!

30:48.977 --> 30:50.370
Looks like you still play.

30:50.413 --> 30:53.373
Oh, uh... a little.

30:53.416 --> 30:56.289
I own, um, "Strings & Notes"
on Wabash.

30:56.332 --> 30:57.507
-By the donut shop?
-Yeah.

30:57.551 --> 30:58.900
Yeah, I've seen it.
I've never been in.

30:58.944 --> 31:00.597
I'm not musically inclined.

31:00.641 --> 31:03.426
But your mom
is a music teacher.

31:03.470 --> 31:05.211
Yeah, she made the mistake
one Christmas

31:05.254 --> 31:06.603
of giving me a camera.

31:06.647 --> 31:07.604
That was it for me.

31:07.648 --> 31:08.562
Mm.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.348
-There you go.
-Ahem.

31:13.436 --> 31:14.611
Thanks.

31:14.655 --> 31:17.049
It was a recital...

31:18.311 --> 31:19.965
In my Mom's living room.

31:20.008 --> 31:21.749
Where I first saw you.

31:23.055 --> 31:25.405
You were that girl
hiding behind your cello.

31:28.060 --> 31:29.061
Anyway, uh...

31:29.104 --> 31:30.149
your apple.

31:30.192 --> 31:31.150
Thank you.

31:34.718 --> 31:36.242
It was great seeing you
again, Jessica.

31:36.285 --> 31:38.505
You as well,
Mrs. Miller's son.

31:38.548 --> 31:39.506
That's right.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.857
Call me Luke.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.685
Luke.

31:57.785 --> 31:59.395
Donut?

31:59.439 --> 32:01.180
No Santa pants?

32:01.223 --> 32:03.747
Clashed with my shirt.

32:03.791 --> 32:05.227
Nice place.

32:05.271 --> 32:06.750
Thanks.

32:06.794 --> 32:09.144
You probably wonder
what I'm doing here.

32:09.188 --> 32:11.320
Yeah. Kinda.

32:15.368 --> 32:18.371
Oh... it's beautiful.

32:18.414 --> 32:19.589
May I?

32:19.633 --> 32:20.721
Please.

32:20.764 --> 32:22.679
Is this your mother's?

32:22.723 --> 32:24.464
One of her favorites.

32:24.507 --> 32:25.465
Wow.

32:26.945 --> 32:28.337
You're not selling it,
are you?

32:28.381 --> 32:29.295
No.

32:29.338 --> 32:32.037
Actually...

32:32.080 --> 32:34.996
She has instructed me

32:35.040 --> 32:36.650
to give it to you.

32:36.693 --> 32:38.304
What?

32:38.347 --> 32:39.827
Christmas present.

32:39.870 --> 32:41.089
No. No, no, no, no.
I-I-- I couldn't--

32:41.133 --> 32:42.308
She insists.

32:42.351 --> 32:44.310
You can check
the 15 emails she sent me,

32:44.353 --> 32:45.746
if you don't believe me.

32:45.789 --> 32:48.009
But all I did
was send her a card.

32:48.053 --> 32:52.361
Well... that card
brought me here.

32:52.405 --> 32:54.189
Wow.

32:54.233 --> 32:56.670
Okay, then, well,
I should probably confess

32:56.713 --> 32:58.715
that I originally
bought that card

32:58.759 --> 32:59.978
for my ex-boyfriend,

33:00.021 --> 33:03.546
but he dumped me
before I could send it.

33:06.245 --> 33:07.594
-Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Ouch.
-No, no, no.

33:07.637 --> 33:09.030
I shouldn't be laughing.

33:09.074 --> 33:10.727
It's okay, it's all right.

33:10.771 --> 33:12.338
I actually bought five of 'em,

33:12.381 --> 33:13.556
so I sent them

33:13.600 --> 33:15.428
to the most important people
in my life,

33:15.471 --> 33:18.518
so it actually turned out
kind of perfectly.

33:18.561 --> 33:20.781
I'm not trying to be nosy,
but who were the other four?

33:20.824 --> 33:22.957
My best friend, my brother,
my aunt,

33:23.001 --> 33:25.090
and a guy in a boy band.

33:25.133 --> 33:26.134
Boy band?

33:26.178 --> 33:27.483
Mm-hmm. Jax.

33:27.527 --> 33:29.094
- Ohh...
-Okay!

33:29.137 --> 33:30.704
Before you judge me...

33:32.227 --> 33:35.013
His music got me
through a really tough time.

33:35.056 --> 33:37.058
Whatever you say.

33:37.102 --> 33:39.974
Just take the cello.

33:41.149 --> 33:43.499
How do I thank her?

33:44.674 --> 33:47.460
Well...

33:47.503 --> 33:49.679
I guess you can start
by playing it.

34:26.325 --> 34:27.717
Don't stop.

34:29.632 --> 34:31.765
That was... beautiful.

34:31.808 --> 34:33.375
Thank you.

34:33.419 --> 34:35.247
She's auditioning
for the Heritage.

34:35.290 --> 34:36.204
That's incredible.

34:36.248 --> 34:37.292
It's a long shot.

34:37.336 --> 34:39.468
Not from what I just heard.

34:39.512 --> 34:40.774
It was the cello, believe me.

34:40.817 --> 34:42.906
I've heard that cello before,

34:42.950 --> 34:44.995
and it has never
sounded like that.

34:45.039 --> 34:46.867
But if you ever tell
Mrs. Miller that,

34:46.910 --> 34:47.868
I will totally deny it.

34:47.911 --> 34:50.566
Mm-mm. Mum's the word.

34:50.610 --> 34:53.743
Uh... hi.

34:53.787 --> 34:55.919
Anyway...

34:55.963 --> 34:57.138
good luck.

34:57.182 --> 34:58.792
Thank you.
You too.

34:58.835 --> 35:01.186
I mean... Merry Christmas.

35:01.229 --> 35:02.578
Oh! Uh...

35:02.622 --> 35:04.754
One more thing.

35:04.798 --> 35:06.234
Who did the tree?

35:06.278 --> 35:10.151
Jessica.

35:10.195 --> 35:13.502
You don't, by chance, have
a free hour after work, do you?

35:13.546 --> 35:14.677
She can go right now.

35:14.721 --> 35:17.376
This place
practically runs itself!

35:17.419 --> 35:19.987
You know, I-I'm actually
taking a break

35:20.030 --> 35:22.207
from dating
for a while, so...

35:22.250 --> 35:23.860
Okay.

35:23.904 --> 35:25.253
That's great.

35:25.297 --> 35:27.212
But, actually, I'm wondering
if you could help me

35:27.255 --> 35:29.692
pick out a tree and ornaments,

35:29.736 --> 35:31.346
and whatever you did there.

35:31.390 --> 35:32.565
Oh.

35:32.608 --> 35:33.914
She'd love to.

35:35.611 --> 35:37.483
-Yeah?
-Sure.

35:44.707 --> 35:45.969
Well, hello, you two.

35:47.928 --> 35:49.582
He pulled me
the whole way here.

35:49.625 --> 35:51.497
Any luck finding
his forever home?

35:51.540 --> 35:53.020
No.

35:53.063 --> 35:53.934
Not yet.

35:53.977 --> 35:55.631
Blitzen.

35:55.675 --> 35:57.329
Don't worry, boy.

35:57.372 --> 36:00.767
Well, maybe if you groom him
and take a new photo.

36:00.810 --> 36:04.205
Yeah, dog grooming
is not really my wheelhouse,

36:04.249 --> 36:05.685
but I'm game.

36:10.342 --> 36:12.648
I have some Christmas
decorations in the house.

36:12.692 --> 36:15.695
We could spruce him up
if you want to take a picture.

36:15.738 --> 36:16.652
Yeah! Yeah, let's.

36:17.958 --> 36:19.177
What do you say then?

36:19.220 --> 36:20.265
Blitzen! Come on.

36:21.396 --> 36:22.658
Let's clean you up.

36:23.790 --> 36:25.183
Your niece sounds great.

36:25.226 --> 36:26.749
She is.

36:26.793 --> 36:28.751
And Carter is in the military.

36:28.795 --> 36:29.883
Oh, you must be very proud.

36:29.926 --> 36:31.189
I am.

36:31.232 --> 36:33.278
Their parents died
when he was a baby,

36:33.321 --> 36:36.237
but Jessica was 13...

36:36.281 --> 36:37.543
hit her really hard.

36:39.284 --> 36:41.808
And over the years,
she's stopped taking chances.

36:41.851 --> 36:43.810
I can understand that.

36:44.985 --> 36:47.205
Let's put a bow in your hair!

36:47.248 --> 36:49.337
On behalf of dogs everywhere,
let's not,

36:49.381 --> 36:51.470
especially if
I'm gonna be walking him.

36:51.513 --> 36:53.254
Okay, just on his collar then.

36:53.298 --> 36:55.125
Oh, boy...

36:55.169 --> 36:56.301
-Beautiful.

36:56.344 --> 36:57.693
Yeah.

37:02.698 --> 37:05.005
Hey, let's take one
with all three of us?

37:05.048 --> 37:07.094
Okay.

37:07.137 --> 37:09.488
Oh!

37:11.098 --> 37:12.317
Oh, that's great.

37:14.971 --> 37:16.190
You know...

37:18.323 --> 37:19.498
He can stay with me

37:19.541 --> 37:21.935
until you find him
a forever home.

37:21.978 --> 37:23.023
Are you sure?

37:23.066 --> 37:24.242
That could be a while.

37:24.285 --> 37:26.505
I'm sure.

37:34.643 --> 37:36.036
Hey.

37:37.255 --> 37:38.604
You okay?

37:38.647 --> 37:41.389
Because I practically
cried over a Christmas card?

37:41.433 --> 37:42.695
I'm fine.

37:42.738 --> 37:45.088
-Just checking.
-Thanks.

37:46.351 --> 37:48.614
I guess your card
just reminded me

37:48.657 --> 37:50.703
that my family's...

37:50.746 --> 37:52.661
Actually, it's just two of us.

37:52.705 --> 37:54.794
Me and my Mom.

37:54.837 --> 37:57.405
She stopped talking to me
when I enlisted.

37:57.449 --> 37:58.450
I'm sorry.

37:59.799 --> 38:02.018
She's afraid
something will happen to me.

38:02.062 --> 38:04.064
She can't understand
this is what I want.

38:04.107 --> 38:05.805
Guess it can be hard
for some people.

38:05.848 --> 38:07.154
Yeah.

38:07.197 --> 38:08.503
Plus, Christmas and all,
you know,

38:08.547 --> 38:09.896
it's a time
people get homesick.

38:09.939 --> 38:11.680
Even when you're home.

38:11.724 --> 38:12.899
Where's home?

38:12.942 --> 38:14.030
Florida.

38:14.074 --> 38:16.206
Oh! Yeah, all the sun
and oranges,

38:16.250 --> 38:17.425
that must be brutal.

38:17.469 --> 38:19.297
Can't build a snowman
with orange peels.

38:19.340 --> 38:21.081
What? You've never
built a snowman?

38:21.124 --> 38:22.735
No. You?

38:22.778 --> 38:24.258
From Chicago.
We build, like, three a day.

38:25.825 --> 38:28.567
Come on.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.659
♪ My way

38:33.702 --> 38:35.530
♪ Find my way...

38:35.574 --> 38:37.880
♪ Back home

38:39.839 --> 38:40.927
Yeah, I like that.

38:40.970 --> 38:42.494
That's good, that's good,
that's good.

38:42.537 --> 38:43.843
You're up early.

38:43.886 --> 38:45.366
I'm writing.

38:45.410 --> 38:46.672
On a napkin?

38:46.715 --> 38:49.022
I wrote "Luv U On Christmas"
on a paper towel.

38:49.065 --> 38:50.632
Speaking of which,
shouldn't you be rehearsing?

38:50.676 --> 38:52.504
I'm gonna be
doing a new song.

38:52.547 --> 38:54.680
Oh, pretty sure
they don't want a new one.

38:54.723 --> 38:55.811
Convince them.

38:55.855 --> 38:57.596
Jax.

38:57.639 --> 38:59.119
Do you remember
the band's first gig?

38:59.162 --> 39:01.251
Christmas Eve
at that little dive

39:01.295 --> 39:02.775
near the El tracks?

39:02.818 --> 39:04.211
Remember? Yeah. I had to give
the club owner my watch

39:04.254 --> 39:05.212
just to get you that spot.

39:06.648 --> 39:09.608
All of us together--
that was real music.

39:09.651 --> 39:11.000
Yeah.

39:11.044 --> 39:13.176
I gotta find
that feeling again.

39:15.875 --> 39:17.703
Okay.

39:23.578 --> 39:27.147
♪ Woke up
Two weeks before Christmas ♪

39:27.190 --> 39:30.542
♪ Singing
The same old song ♪

39:32.457 --> 39:34.284
"Three weeks before Christmas"?

39:34.328 --> 39:35.851
Two weeks before Christmas.

39:37.418 --> 39:39.289
Ah. Norway Spruce--

39:39.333 --> 39:40.378
it's pretty,

39:40.421 --> 39:42.597
but it drops needles
kind of quickly.

39:42.641 --> 39:44.033
Good to know.

39:44.077 --> 39:46.384
Noble fir.
Holds heavy ornaments.

39:46.427 --> 39:48.560
Hmm! Are you an arborist?

39:48.603 --> 39:52.346
No, I'm just someone
who overdoes Christmas.

39:52.390 --> 39:53.695
Or at least I used to.

39:53.739 --> 39:55.697
I'm trying to cut down
a little bit.

39:55.741 --> 39:57.612
Pretty sure
there are worse habits.

39:57.656 --> 39:59.614
Christmas is about love.

39:59.658 --> 40:01.094
You can never have
too much love, right?

40:01.137 --> 40:02.225
Where'd you hear that?

40:02.269 --> 40:03.705
-Wedding vows.
-You married?

40:03.749 --> 40:06.534
No! No, I just go
to a lot of weddings.

40:06.578 --> 40:09.363
I'm the guy behind the camera
saying "Cheese."

40:09.407 --> 40:11.017
Yeah, I used to think

40:11.060 --> 40:13.541
I was gonna change the world
with my photos.

40:13.585 --> 40:17.110
Turns out, that doesn't
pay the bills, so...

40:17.153 --> 40:19.068
wedding dresses
and "I Do's."

40:19.112 --> 40:20.940
Oh. You're giving people
memories.

40:20.983 --> 40:23.377
That's true.

40:23.421 --> 40:26.511
Ah! Christmas fir--
the king of Christmas.

40:26.554 --> 40:27.599
Great needle retention

40:27.642 --> 40:28.948
and the best smell.

40:28.991 --> 40:29.992
Sold!

40:30.036 --> 40:31.516
It's a little big,
don't you think?

40:31.559 --> 40:33.039
Nope.

40:33.082 --> 40:34.257
Do you live
in a department store?

40:34.301 --> 40:35.737
Rockefeller Center.

40:35.781 --> 40:37.696
Ah! Perfect then.

40:37.739 --> 40:40.525
Now we just need
a couple hundred feet of lights

40:40.568 --> 40:42.309
and 50 pounds of tinsel,
we'll be good to go.

40:42.352 --> 40:43.528
Great.

40:45.965 --> 40:48.315
You skate?

40:48.358 --> 40:51.144
Uh... hockey. You?

40:51.187 --> 40:52.493
Figure-eights.

40:52.537 --> 40:54.495
Oh...

40:54.539 --> 40:56.541
You know, we play
every Wednesday and Friday night

40:56.584 --> 40:57.629
at Lincoln Park rink,

40:57.672 --> 40:59.544
if you ever want
to join us.

40:59.587 --> 41:01.546
-But I--
-Not a date.

41:01.589 --> 41:04.636
Just a... skate.

41:08.117 --> 41:10.206
-Oh...
-No!

41:10.250 --> 41:11.643
It's a classic!

41:11.686 --> 41:13.949
So is "The Chipmunk Song."

41:13.993 --> 41:15.647
Oh, and I like
that one, too!

41:15.690 --> 41:17.736
-Oh!
-Uh-huh.

41:17.779 --> 41:19.651
"Grandma Got Run Over
By a Reindeer"?

41:19.694 --> 41:20.521
On my top-10 list.

41:20.565 --> 41:22.741
Ohh!

41:22.784 --> 41:25.483
And you call yourself
a music aficionado?

41:27.659 --> 41:29.008
Hey you mind

41:29.051 --> 41:32.968
if we drop this enormous Sequoia
off on our way?

41:33.012 --> 41:35.928
I'm just not sure I'm man enough
to carry it on my own.

41:35.971 --> 41:38.017
So, what, you give me
one priceless cello

41:38.060 --> 41:39.279
and, all of a sudden,

41:39.322 --> 41:41.237
I'm your personal
holiday assistant?

41:41.281 --> 41:44.240
Santa needs his Mrs. Claus.

41:44.284 --> 41:47.156
Technically,
her name is Mrs. Kringle.

41:47.200 --> 41:49.463
And I suppose
you know her first name, too.

41:49.507 --> 41:50.856
Oh, I do.

41:50.899 --> 41:52.510
It's actually "Jessica."

41:52.553 --> 41:55.817
Please tell me you were not
named after Mrs. Kringle.

41:55.861 --> 41:58.341
No, I was not.

41:59.908 --> 42:02.737
"Jessica and Kris Kringle."

42:02.781 --> 42:04.304
It's got a ring to it.

42:04.347 --> 42:06.698
Yes. It does.

42:13.487 --> 42:14.619
We're here.

42:14.662 --> 42:16.577
I thought
the tree was for you.

42:16.621 --> 42:19.145
No. I already have a tree.

42:20.712 --> 42:21.843
Is it Primo's?

42:23.366 --> 42:25.934
Please tell me this isn't
some sort of "proposal tree."

42:25.978 --> 42:26.935
What?

42:26.979 --> 42:28.546
No.

42:29.721 --> 42:31.157
St. Mary's.

42:31.200 --> 42:33.638
Oh! Oh, that's so nice.

42:33.681 --> 42:35.770
I'm kind of attached
to the place.

42:35.814 --> 42:37.380
Oh, you know someone there?

42:37.424 --> 42:40.601
Uh, yeah,
just about everyone.

42:40.645 --> 42:42.560
I volunteer there a lot.

42:42.603 --> 42:45.606
Actually spent a few years there
myself way back when,

42:45.650 --> 42:48.087
until Mrs. Miller found me.

42:48.130 --> 42:49.088
Oh.

42:49.131 --> 42:50.350
Yeah.

42:50.393 --> 42:52.657
You want a hat?
I've got an extra.

42:52.700 --> 42:54.702
-Why not?
-All right!

42:54.746 --> 42:56.617
-Oh! So sorry.

42:56.661 --> 42:57.705
No worries.

42:58.880 --> 43:01.100
Wow, these are beautiful.

43:02.623 --> 43:04.843
Thank you.

43:05.844 --> 43:08.063
Oh! Wow.

43:10.849 --> 43:11.763
Keep it.

43:11.806 --> 43:13.547
What? No. I...

43:13.591 --> 43:15.157
"You want the moon?
Just say the word,

43:15.201 --> 43:17.072
I'll throw a lasso
around it,

43:17.116 --> 43:20.119
and I'll pull it down."

43:23.339 --> 43:24.471
Now come on.

43:25.733 --> 43:26.778
Grab the end of this tree.

43:39.834 --> 43:41.357
Santa! Santa!

43:41.401 --> 43:43.751
Ladies and gentlemen...

43:43.795 --> 43:45.884
Santa has entered the building!

43:45.927 --> 43:47.146
-Ho, ho, ho!

43:50.453 --> 43:51.280
You remembered?

43:51.324 --> 43:53.848
Of course I remembered.

43:53.892 --> 43:56.155
Now, how could I forget
you, hmm?

43:56.198 --> 43:57.678
And you and you...

43:57.722 --> 43:59.419
and you and you and you?

43:59.462 --> 44:02.117
And I'm going to help you
decorate this tree,

44:02.161 --> 44:04.554
right after I take
"Mrs. Kringle" here

44:04.598 --> 44:06.687
back to the North Pole.

44:06.731 --> 44:08.341
Now, wait a second, Santa.

44:08.384 --> 44:10.909
Do you remember what happened

44:10.952 --> 44:13.607
the last time I left
the decorations up to you?

44:13.651 --> 44:16.175
Not off-hand.

44:16.218 --> 44:18.133
Well, let's just say it ended

44:18.177 --> 44:21.180
with a tipped-over tree
and an electrical shortage.

44:22.355 --> 44:24.139
Oh, ho!

44:24.183 --> 44:26.446
Ho, ho, ho. Oh!
It's all coming back to me now.

44:26.489 --> 44:27.403
Yeah.

44:27.447 --> 44:28.796
Ho, ho, ho.

44:30.319 --> 44:32.931
Well, Mrs. Kringle here

44:32.974 --> 44:36.282
listens to boy bands.

44:36.325 --> 44:37.370
Uh-huh!

44:38.893 --> 44:40.242
Well, did you know

44:40.286 --> 44:42.549
that Santa eats donuts
for breakfast?

44:42.592 --> 44:44.029
-Mm!
-Uh-huh.

44:44.072 --> 44:44.986
Who doesn't?

44:45.030 --> 44:48.337
Oh, ho, ho, ho!

44:52.211 --> 44:54.430
Ho, ho, ho...

44:54.474 --> 44:56.128
You're back!

44:56.171 --> 44:58.217
I got some things for Blitzen.

44:58.260 --> 45:00.523
Oh!
Thank you.

45:02.525 --> 45:04.179
A '72 Scamp!

45:04.223 --> 45:05.398
She is beautiful!

45:05.441 --> 45:08.227
It's my husband's.

45:08.270 --> 45:10.403
The "Lug Nut"
was crazy about this car.

45:10.446 --> 45:11.665
Must have taken it apart

45:11.709 --> 45:13.362
and put it back together
20 times.

45:13.406 --> 45:14.842
When was the last time
you drove it?

45:14.886 --> 45:16.061
I haven't.

45:17.802 --> 45:19.151
He wanted me to,

45:19.194 --> 45:21.631
but I'll probably just
sell it now.

45:21.675 --> 45:23.068
You know, cars are like us.

45:23.111 --> 45:24.417
It's not good
for them to sit around.

45:26.201 --> 45:29.248
Have you finished
your Christmas shopping yet?

45:30.945 --> 45:32.642
Actually, I haven't started.

45:32.686 --> 45:34.601
Neither have I.

45:52.837 --> 45:55.013
Ahem. You requisitioned a car
for your supply run?

45:55.056 --> 45:56.928
That doesn't look
regulation, Rudolph.

46:13.683 --> 46:15.773
You get your orders yet?

46:15.816 --> 46:17.557
No.

46:17.600 --> 46:19.211
Hopefully
somewhere with snow.

46:19.254 --> 46:21.648
You really like snow.

46:22.867 --> 46:24.042
I've spent a lot of years

46:24.085 --> 46:26.566
hearing about
these "white Christmases."

46:32.659 --> 46:35.227
Hang on.

46:50.895 --> 46:52.635
Electrical short.
I got this.

46:52.679 --> 46:54.289
Just need to wait
till the engine cools.

46:55.638 --> 46:57.510
You know...

46:57.553 --> 47:00.078
there's something
I've been wanting to do.

47:00.121 --> 47:01.775
Okay.

47:02.907 --> 47:03.951
Make a snowman.

47:03.995 --> 47:05.605
Oh!

47:05.648 --> 47:07.085
What'd you think
I was going to say?

47:07.128 --> 47:08.434
That's absolutely what
I thought you were gonna say.

47:09.565 --> 47:11.829
Come on.

47:14.919 --> 47:16.050
When I was little,

47:16.094 --> 47:18.009
my mom and I used to make
little snowmen

47:18.052 --> 47:19.401
with mashed potatoes.

47:19.445 --> 47:21.316
We'd use olives for eyes

47:21.360 --> 47:23.710
and a little carrot nose.

47:26.887 --> 47:29.063
Mashed potato snowmen...
that's quite the tradition.

47:29.107 --> 47:30.717
I'd forgotten about it...

47:30.760 --> 47:31.718
until now.

47:40.814 --> 47:42.598
What are you doing with that?

47:42.642 --> 47:44.165
No, no. No. No!

47:45.645 --> 47:47.560
You'll be missing Florida.

48:11.366 --> 48:13.891
Okay... what is it?

48:15.805 --> 48:17.764
Uh...

48:18.939 --> 48:20.375
The gig fell through.

48:20.419 --> 48:22.987
Ahh. What, did the 12-year-old
lose all his followers?

48:23.030 --> 48:25.598
No, no,
he's still playing.

48:25.641 --> 48:27.687
You're just not opening for him.

48:30.820 --> 48:32.910
I told them that you wanted
to play a new song,

48:32.953 --> 48:34.868
and they said no.

48:34.912 --> 48:36.565
So...

48:36.609 --> 48:37.871
I said no.

48:37.915 --> 48:41.266
You said no
to a paying gig?

48:41.309 --> 48:42.789
Yeah.

48:42.832 --> 48:46.749
Well, like somebody said,
it's... it's about the music.

48:49.709 --> 48:51.754
You're not mad, are you?

48:52.930 --> 48:54.061
Mad?

48:54.105 --> 48:55.106
Look...

49:00.589 --> 49:03.027
Thank you
for believing in me.

49:04.419 --> 49:06.508
I've always believed in you.
You're my brother.

49:06.552 --> 49:09.337
Hey, so, uh,
let's hear that song.

49:09.381 --> 49:10.643
Yeah, it's a--
it's a Christmas song.

49:10.686 --> 49:11.949
Yeah, that's a good start.

49:11.992 --> 49:13.689
I've had this tune
stuck in my head all week.

49:13.733 --> 49:15.039
Check it out.

49:19.913 --> 49:21.045
It's good, right?

49:21.088 --> 49:22.176
No...

49:22.220 --> 49:23.569
Relax! Relax.
I've got this.

49:23.612 --> 49:24.700
I know you do.

49:24.744 --> 49:26.572
You know
what I don't have, though?

49:26.615 --> 49:27.877
A band.

49:27.921 --> 49:29.096
I'll call the boys!

49:30.445 --> 49:31.664
No.

49:31.707 --> 49:33.231
I'll do it.

49:33.274 --> 49:35.711
I'll call Tim and Perry.

49:35.755 --> 49:37.975
The beginning
of my "Apology Tour."

49:42.196 --> 49:44.111
Thanks, bro.

Wow, we were there
for six hours.

50:02.434 --> 50:04.871
Yeah, that's like...

50:04.914 --> 50:06.916
six first dates.

50:06.960 --> 50:08.527
If this were a date,
which it's not.

50:08.570 --> 50:10.485
Your dates only last an hour?

50:12.009 --> 50:13.314
About five minutes, tops.

50:13.358 --> 50:15.708
I spend the rest of my hour
just being polite.

50:15.751 --> 50:17.101
Five minutes?

50:17.144 --> 50:18.319
Oh, come on, you know

50:18.363 --> 50:19.842
in the first five minutes,
right?

50:19.886 --> 50:21.322
No.

50:21.366 --> 50:24.543
You're telling me
it takes you three years

50:24.586 --> 50:27.067
to figure out if it's gonna
work with somebody? Huh?

50:27.111 --> 50:28.677
Mm, I can't say,

50:28.721 --> 50:31.637
because I've never been in
a three-year relationship.

50:31.680 --> 50:33.160
Mine usually end around
the three-month point.

50:33.204 --> 50:34.596
-Three months?
-Mm-hmm.

50:34.640 --> 50:36.250
It's like a 90-day warranty?

50:36.294 --> 50:37.730
Five minutes?

50:37.773 --> 50:39.775
Like the grace period
in a parking lot?

50:39.819 --> 50:41.821
So who's more messed up,
you or me?

50:41.864 --> 50:43.040
I'm gonna go with you.

50:44.563 --> 50:46.869
Then again, I'm alone, too,
so I can't really talk.

50:46.913 --> 50:47.870
Touche.

50:47.914 --> 50:48.958
Oh, no!

50:49.002 --> 50:50.090
That's him.
That's him.

50:50.134 --> 50:51.265
Who?

50:51.309 --> 50:52.658
Mm. The guy
that just dumped me.

50:52.701 --> 50:54.225
-The fake doctor guy?
-Yeah.

50:56.140 --> 50:57.489
I don't want to see him.

50:57.532 --> 50:59.230
Taller than I thought.

51:00.405 --> 51:01.667
Here.

51:01.710 --> 51:03.234
Ahem.

51:03.277 --> 51:04.452
What are you doing?

51:04.496 --> 51:06.976
You don't have to see him...

51:07.020 --> 51:09.501
but he can see you.

51:09.544 --> 51:11.590
Holding hands with Santa?

51:12.939 --> 51:14.767
Works for me.

51:18.988 --> 51:21.165
Or how about...

51:21.208 --> 51:24.603
Jessica kissing Kris Kringle?

51:25.821 --> 51:27.519
That works for me, too.

51:27.562 --> 51:30.304
Okay, but let's just be clear,
this is not real.

51:30.348 --> 51:31.392
No.

51:31.436 --> 51:32.524
Fake kiss.

51:32.567 --> 51:34.743
Fake doctor, fake Santa.

51:34.787 --> 51:36.615
I got it.

51:53.153 --> 51:55.112
Did he see?

51:56.243 --> 51:57.549
Who cares?

52:05.687 --> 52:08.081
I-- uh, I'm-I'm gonna go...

52:08.125 --> 52:09.691
I'm gonna-- I'm gonna
take a cab now--

52:09.735 --> 52:10.953
-No.
-...And go.

52:10.997 --> 52:11.911
-I'll take you.
-No.

52:11.954 --> 52:12.825
It's no problem.

52:12.868 --> 52:14.783
No. But thank you.

52:27.535 --> 52:28.754
Goodnight.

53:03.310 --> 53:05.182
You've never sounded better.

53:07.967 --> 53:09.664
And don't say
it's the cello.

53:09.708 --> 53:11.231
It's you.

53:11.275 --> 53:14.234
I don't want to make an idiot
of myself at the audition.

53:14.278 --> 53:15.148
You won't.

53:15.192 --> 53:17.063
I might.

53:17.106 --> 53:18.847
So? What if you do?

53:18.891 --> 53:20.675
It's the Heritage!

53:20.719 --> 53:23.287
I'm sure they've seen
plenty of hacks before.

53:23.330 --> 53:25.289
Oh, that makes me feel
so much better!

53:25.332 --> 53:26.725
Thank you.

53:26.768 --> 53:29.423
And I feel better,
knowing you haven't given up...

53:29.467 --> 53:31.382
on romance
and Christmas.

53:31.425 --> 53:32.774
Mimi.

53:32.818 --> 53:34.211
You bought a tree together,

53:34.254 --> 53:35.212
you decorated it,

53:35.255 --> 53:36.387
you went caroling...

53:36.430 --> 53:37.823
and...

53:37.866 --> 53:40.347
he gave you a cello,
all in less than 24 hours.

53:40.391 --> 53:41.435
Not to mention,

53:41.479 --> 53:42.828
I like him.

53:42.871 --> 53:44.395
You don't even know him.

53:45.657 --> 53:46.832
I know
he wears Santa pants.

53:46.875 --> 53:48.225
I told you that?

53:48.268 --> 53:51.053
By the way, your last boyfriend
ironed his jeans.

53:51.097 --> 53:53.404
You know
way too much information.

53:54.796 --> 53:56.842
Just tell me that
you're gonna see him again.

53:56.885 --> 53:59.279
I don't know.
I don't know.

53:59.323 --> 54:00.889
Well, how was it left?

54:00.933 --> 54:02.804
Did he ask you out?

54:02.848 --> 54:05.024
Did he shake your hand?

54:06.330 --> 54:08.332
You kissed!

54:08.375 --> 54:09.289
Okay.

54:09.333 --> 54:10.725
It wasn't real.

54:10.769 --> 54:13.380
Wes was there,
that's why it happened--

54:13.424 --> 54:14.729
it was purely tactical.

54:14.773 --> 54:16.818
What does that even mean?

54:16.862 --> 54:19.821
You know, I don't care.
Who kissed who?

54:19.865 --> 54:21.345
I don't remember.

54:21.388 --> 54:23.782
Did he move in first,
or did you?

54:23.825 --> 54:26.872
Well? What do you remember?

54:26.915 --> 54:28.308
Nothing.

54:28.352 --> 54:32.312
We kissed and...
I forget the rest.

54:32.356 --> 54:34.271
That is so romantic.

54:34.314 --> 54:35.315
Oh!

54:36.490 --> 54:37.491
Hey, Ruth.
Hey, Joshua.

54:37.535 --> 54:38.753
We were wondering

54:38.797 --> 54:41.103
if Joshua could switch
to the guitar.

54:41.147 --> 54:42.627
Of course you can.

54:44.977 --> 54:46.457
You owe me dinner.

54:47.588 --> 54:49.895
Oh! That looks so cool.

54:49.938 --> 54:51.592
What a beautiful picture.

54:51.636 --> 54:54.291
Oh, yeah, it's the, um,
it's the kids at St. Mary's.

54:54.334 --> 54:57.337
St. Mary's...
that's downtown, right?

54:57.381 --> 54:59.513
Yeah. Uh, the photographer
who took it, Luke Miller,

54:59.557 --> 55:01.602
he spends a lot of time
with the kids down there.

55:01.646 --> 55:02.777
Does he have a website?

55:02.821 --> 55:05.171
Yeah, I think so.

55:07.304 --> 55:10.655
♪ Woke up

55:10.698 --> 55:14.485

55:41.033 --> 55:42.251
-Good to see you, man.
-Long time, brother.

55:42.295 --> 55:44.123
How long has it been?

55:44.166 --> 55:45.820
Nine years,
two album flops,

55:45.864 --> 55:47.126
and a partridge
in a pear tree.

55:47.169 --> 55:49.171
Oh, what a dump.

55:49.215 --> 55:50.259
I live in two rooms,

55:50.303 --> 55:51.565
I don't know
what the rest are for.

55:51.609 --> 55:52.566
Remember our old apartment?

55:52.610 --> 55:53.785
One room for all of us.

55:53.828 --> 55:56.570
Taking turns
sleeping in the hallway.

55:56.614 --> 55:58.224
Standing up!

55:59.791 --> 56:01.880
I don't even remember
why we broke up.

56:01.923 --> 56:04.752
Uh, you wanted to go solo.

56:04.796 --> 56:06.798
Uh, didn't work out so well.

56:06.841 --> 56:07.799
Yeah, we know.

56:07.842 --> 56:09.278
We-- We know.

56:10.628 --> 56:12.760
Look, I'm sorry, guys.
I don't...

56:12.804 --> 56:14.371
I was stupid.
And selfish and...

56:14.414 --> 56:15.459
Young.

56:15.502 --> 56:16.547
Mm-hmm.

56:16.590 --> 56:18.375
We all were.
We've all made mistakes.

56:19.854 --> 56:21.029
I'm just really glad
you called.

56:21.073 --> 56:23.205
Me too.

56:23.249 --> 56:24.381
Me three.

56:25.860 --> 56:28.646
So, what's this I hear
about a new Christmas song?

56:28.689 --> 56:30.909
I don't know if you guys
are ready, but follow me.

56:30.952 --> 56:33.520
-All right!

56:36.131 --> 56:38.699
Got it. Perfect.

56:40.527 --> 56:42.224
So? I heard
you went out with Leslie?

56:42.268 --> 56:44.313
Uh, kind of.

56:44.357 --> 56:47.360
It was sweet of you to offer
to take her headshots.

56:47.404 --> 56:49.318
-I did?
-Hi, Luke!

56:49.362 --> 56:50.798
So, I was thinking.

56:50.842 --> 56:53.105
I brought a change of wardrobe.

56:53.148 --> 56:54.367
Maybe we could do
some shots right now?

56:54.411 --> 56:55.716
Uh...

56:55.760 --> 56:57.718
The thing is,
I have a hockey thing.

56:57.762 --> 56:59.981
It's my annual Christmas game.
I'm already running late.

57:00.025 --> 57:02.419
-I love hockey.
-She does!

57:02.462 --> 57:04.899
Okay.

57:08.773 --> 57:09.817
Now, Blitzen,

57:09.861 --> 57:12.472
this is my famous fruitcake.

57:12.516 --> 57:13.604
You may think you want some,

57:13.647 --> 57:14.909
but you don't,
trust me.

57:17.042 --> 57:19.784
Let's get you
your kibble for one.

57:21.960 --> 57:24.919
You're such a good boy.

57:27.922 --> 57:29.968
That's where that went!

57:32.753 --> 57:35.147
Oh!

57:40.587 --> 57:42.415
"Dear Aunt Lila,

57:42.459 --> 57:44.199
it wouldn't be Christmas
without you,

57:44.243 --> 57:46.811
and I wouldn't be
the person I am today..."

57:48.334 --> 57:51.468
"...if you and Uncle CJ
hadn't been there for me."

57:53.557 --> 57:55.646
"You taught me to be kind,

57:55.689 --> 57:57.865
to be strong,

57:57.909 --> 58:00.825
and to always
believe in myself."

58:02.043 --> 58:03.654
"I'm lucky.

58:03.697 --> 58:05.525
I'm blessed.

58:05.569 --> 58:07.353
Thank you."

58:08.572 --> 58:10.661
"Love Jessica."

58:26.546 --> 58:28.156
Hey--

58:28.200 --> 58:29.680
Are you crying?

58:30.855 --> 58:32.900
I just read
your Christmas card...

58:32.944 --> 58:36.121
and I wanted to thank you.

58:36.164 --> 58:37.949
Being in your life
and Carter's life

58:37.992 --> 58:39.951
has been the greatest joy
of my life.

58:39.994 --> 58:41.169
Oh!

58:41.213 --> 58:42.606
Now you're gonna
make me cry!

58:43.781 --> 58:45.434
Are you watching a dog movie?

58:45.478 --> 58:48.089
No, I'm watching a real dog.

58:49.308 --> 58:51.353
Blitzen, this is Jessica.

58:52.572 --> 58:53.878
Aw! That's so sweet!

58:53.921 --> 58:55.619
He's with me
until he gets adopted.

58:55.662 --> 58:57.446
But, honey, how are you?

58:57.490 --> 59:00.188
Are you getting out?

59:00.232 --> 59:02.016
Just because some fake doctor

59:02.060 --> 59:03.540
did you a favor
and broke up with you

59:03.583 --> 59:04.976
doesn't mean
you need to be sitting around.

59:05.019 --> 59:06.194
I'm not.

59:07.631 --> 59:09.197
Oh. Time for a walk.

59:09.241 --> 59:10.155
Love you! Mwah!

59:10.198 --> 59:11.156
Love you.

59:11.199 --> 59:13.071
Mwah. Bye.

59:32.351 --> 59:34.353
That's good.
Like it.

59:34.396 --> 59:36.442
Chin up?

59:36.485 --> 59:37.574
There we go.

59:40.533 --> 59:42.100
Sorry to interrupt.
Uh...

59:43.405 --> 59:44.668
We're, uh,
we're dropping the puck.

59:44.711 --> 59:46.278
Uh, oh, uh, Leslie, Primo.

59:46.321 --> 59:48.106
-Primo, Leslie.
-Hey.

59:50.238 --> 59:51.326
You did
that toothpaste commercial!

59:51.370 --> 59:52.850
Yeah! You saw that?

59:52.893 --> 59:54.982
Saw it? Yeah!
I even bought some.

59:55.026 --> 59:57.071
See? It works.

59:58.638 --> 1:00:00.292
You didn't tell me you were
working with a celebrity.

1:00:00.335 --> 1:00:01.293
Look at this.

1:00:01.336 --> 1:00:03.034
-Stop.
-Keeping secrets!

1:00:03.077 --> 1:00:04.470
You're coming, right?

1:00:05.732 --> 1:00:07.516
Yeah, give me a minute.
You good?

1:00:07.560 --> 1:00:08.866
Can we just take one
of me skating?

1:00:08.909 --> 1:00:10.302
It's the last one.
I promise.

1:00:10.345 --> 1:00:11.346
I'll be there in a minute.

1:00:11.390 --> 1:00:12.609
Yeah, take your time.

1:00:12.652 --> 1:00:14.567
All right. Ready?

1:00:14.611 --> 1:00:15.916
-Yeah.

1:00:15.960 --> 1:00:17.439
-Okay!

1:00:17.483 --> 1:00:18.876
Whoa...

1:00:18.919 --> 1:00:19.790
You okay?

1:00:37.895 --> 1:00:39.984
They were ice skating together

1:00:40.027 --> 1:00:40.985
and she was gorgeous.

1:00:41.028 --> 1:00:42.421
Not more gorgeous than you.

1:00:42.464 --> 1:00:44.336
John, tell her

1:00:44.379 --> 1:00:45.642
she's more gorgeous
than the ice skater.

1:00:45.685 --> 1:00:47.513
I'd have to see
the ice skater.

1:00:48.732 --> 1:00:50.081
Of course you are.

1:00:51.604 --> 1:00:53.519
Plus, she could be his sister.

1:00:53.562 --> 1:00:54.781
Or his mother.

1:00:54.825 --> 1:00:56.000
Mm, definitely
wasn't his mother.

1:00:56.043 --> 1:00:57.392
Grandmother?

1:00:57.436 --> 1:00:59.264
People don't skate
with their grandmothers, Mimi.

1:00:59.307 --> 1:01:00.569
The point is,

1:01:00.613 --> 1:01:02.223
it's not gonna work out.

1:01:02.267 --> 1:01:04.269
Anyway, what was so important

1:01:04.312 --> 1:01:05.792
that you guys had
to bring me here so early?

1:01:09.840 --> 1:01:11.624
This.

1:01:11.668 --> 1:01:12.930
What?

1:01:12.973 --> 1:01:14.192
You said,

1:01:14.235 --> 1:01:18.283
"my friend who always
tells me the truth."

1:01:18.326 --> 1:01:20.154
Well, John read it
and it turns out,

1:01:20.198 --> 1:01:23.723
we haven't been exactly honest
with each other.

1:01:23.767 --> 1:01:25.943
You haven't?

1:01:25.986 --> 1:01:28.162
We made some promises
when we got married,

1:01:28.206 --> 1:01:29.947
but things changed,

1:01:29.990 --> 1:01:32.427
and we were afraid
to tell each other.

1:01:32.471 --> 1:01:35.561
But your card got us talking
and...

1:01:36.780 --> 1:01:38.129
...We made a decision.

1:01:38.172 --> 1:01:39.608
Oh, no.

1:01:39.652 --> 1:01:42.002
We're not waiting
2.9 years.

1:01:43.134 --> 1:01:44.178
What?

1:01:44.222 --> 1:01:46.703
We want to have a baby.

1:01:46.746 --> 1:01:48.705
A.S.A.P.!

1:01:48.748 --> 1:01:50.532
You guys are gonna be
the best parents!

1:01:50.576 --> 1:01:52.012
And you're gonna be
the best godmother.

1:01:52.056 --> 1:01:53.710
She can call me
Auntie Jess.

1:01:53.753 --> 1:01:54.841
Unless it's a he.

1:01:54.885 --> 1:01:55.973
I'll teach him
how to play the cello.

1:01:56.016 --> 1:01:57.278
Isn't that kind of big
for a baby?

1:01:57.322 --> 1:01:58.758
He won't have time.

1:01:58.802 --> 1:01:59.672
He's playing football.

1:01:59.716 --> 1:02:00.847
Okay.

1:02:04.285 --> 1:02:05.634
Good morning.

1:02:05.678 --> 1:02:06.766
Hey, you two.
You ready to walk?

1:02:06.810 --> 1:02:08.899
Let me get his leash.

1:02:08.942 --> 1:02:11.075
I couldn't resist.

1:02:11.118 --> 1:02:12.729
A Christmas leash.

1:02:12.772 --> 1:02:15.253
Well, we all could use
a new "leash on life," right?

1:02:16.558 --> 1:02:17.908
Something smells good in here.

1:02:17.951 --> 1:02:18.996
Fruitcake.

1:02:19.039 --> 1:02:21.781
The famous fruitcake
is a doorstop?

1:02:21.825 --> 1:02:23.130
Yep.

1:02:23.174 --> 1:02:24.305
Do I get to try it?

1:02:24.349 --> 1:02:25.916
Oh, we don't eat it.

1:02:25.959 --> 1:02:28.005
It's famous for
being hard as a rock.

1:02:28.048 --> 1:02:29.441
It's a family tradition.

1:02:30.877 --> 1:02:34.402
Oh, Lila. I've got some news.
Um...

1:02:34.446 --> 1:02:35.708
Someone I know,

1:02:35.752 --> 1:02:37.710
she and her husband
are looking for a dog.

1:02:37.754 --> 1:02:39.277
I showed them
a picture of Blitzen

1:02:39.320 --> 1:02:40.582
and they'd like to meet him.

1:02:40.626 --> 1:02:42.889
Oh. That's great.

1:02:42.933 --> 1:02:43.934
You okay?

1:02:43.977 --> 1:02:46.066
Of course.

1:02:46.110 --> 1:02:47.372
A forever home.

1:02:47.415 --> 1:02:49.417
I said that
we'd bring him by tomorrow,

1:02:49.461 --> 1:02:50.157
if that's all right.

1:02:50.201 --> 1:02:51.811
Sure.

1:02:51.855 --> 1:02:55.206
Well, Blitzen, we should take
an extra-long walk, shall we?

1:03:00.951 --> 1:03:02.996
After you.

1:03:03.040 --> 1:03:05.564
Jax, Tim, and Perry,

1:03:05.607 --> 1:03:07.827
it's three days before Christmas
and you're all in the same room.

1:03:07.871 --> 1:03:09.437
So I'm gonna ask
what the fans what to know.

1:03:09.481 --> 1:03:11.396
Are we talking reunion?

1:03:11.439 --> 1:03:12.310
Maybe!

1:03:12.353 --> 1:03:17.619
Yeah!

1:03:17.663 --> 1:03:19.491
I mean, we were friends
before we were a band,

1:03:19.534 --> 1:03:20.884
so that's really
the most important thing.

1:03:20.927 --> 1:03:22.015
Come on, Jax.

1:03:22.059 --> 1:03:23.451
More important than the music?

1:03:23.495 --> 1:03:24.975
Yeah! Yeah. It's what
Christmas is all about.

1:03:25.018 --> 1:03:26.759
Being together
with the people you love.

1:03:26.803 --> 1:03:28.674
All right,
I feel that, I feel that.

1:03:28.717 --> 1:03:30.371
Now, last time you guys
were in town,

1:03:30.415 --> 1:03:31.851
you played Horizon Center,
right?

1:03:31.895 --> 1:03:34.854
Yes, we were!
Great show, right?

1:03:34.898 --> 1:03:36.203
And the first time
we played here

1:03:36.247 --> 1:03:37.683
was for about 20 people,

1:03:37.726 --> 1:03:39.685
half of whom were our parents.

1:03:39.728 --> 1:03:41.556
That's what I like to call
a nice, cozy audience.

1:03:41.600 --> 1:03:43.558
-Nice way to put it!

1:03:43.602 --> 1:03:45.386
So where's it gonna be
this time?

1:03:45.430 --> 1:03:47.432
Trying to get that exclusive.

1:03:47.475 --> 1:03:49.129
What do you think
we're all doing here, man?

1:03:49.173 --> 1:03:51.871
Too easy!
How much fun would that be?

1:03:51.915 --> 1:03:52.829
You heard it here first!

1:03:52.872 --> 1:03:54.308
Jax and his boys are back.

1:03:54.352 --> 1:03:55.788
You know the music,
you know the band--

1:03:55.832 --> 1:03:57.268
you love them both.

1:03:57.311 --> 1:03:58.443
I want to wish you guys
a merry Christmas.

1:03:58.486 --> 1:03:59.487
Merry Christmas, guys!

1:04:00.924 --> 1:04:02.012
Hello, Luke.

1:04:02.055 --> 1:04:03.317
I write for

1:04:03.361 --> 1:04:04.753
the South Shore Daily
newspaper.

1:04:04.797 --> 1:04:06.103
Jessica at Strings & Notes

1:04:06.146 --> 1:04:07.321
showed me your photo
of St. Mary's.

1:04:07.365 --> 1:04:09.149
Could we talk?

1:04:09.193 --> 1:04:10.977
Thank you. Ruth Smith.

1:04:18.767 --> 1:04:20.639
Look who's having
a pop-up concert.

1:04:20.682 --> 1:04:22.902
Oh, wow.

1:04:22.946 --> 1:04:25.687
I haven't seen Jax in concert
since I was 14.

1:04:25.731 --> 1:04:27.689
And now you have
your braces off.

1:04:27.733 --> 1:04:29.691
Yes, I do.

1:04:29.735 --> 1:04:31.215
Oh, no.

1:04:31.258 --> 1:04:32.564
Jerk alert.

1:04:32.607 --> 1:04:33.782
I'll get rid of him.

1:04:33.826 --> 1:04:35.045
No. I got this.

1:04:36.611 --> 1:04:38.744
I'll be in the back,
sharpening a drumstick.

1:04:40.746 --> 1:04:41.921
So...

1:04:41.965 --> 1:04:43.183
how are you?

1:04:43.227 --> 1:04:45.403
I'm good.
Thanks.

1:04:45.446 --> 1:04:48.058
You left this in my car.

1:04:48.101 --> 1:04:49.581
How thoughtful of you.

1:04:50.799 --> 1:04:51.931
Look, I really...

1:04:51.975 --> 1:04:54.760
I just wanted
to talk to you in person.

1:04:55.935 --> 1:04:57.458
I was insensitive.

1:04:57.502 --> 1:04:58.982
I can think of another word.

1:04:59.025 --> 1:05:00.418
I got scared.

1:05:00.461 --> 1:05:02.246
All the holidays

1:05:02.289 --> 1:05:04.117
and family stuff

1:05:04.161 --> 1:05:05.379
and the traditions...

1:05:05.423 --> 1:05:07.164
I never had that,

1:05:07.207 --> 1:05:08.905
and it kind of freaked me out.

1:05:09.993 --> 1:05:12.169
It wasn't all you.

1:05:12.212 --> 1:05:14.345
I knew things
weren't right between us.

1:05:14.388 --> 1:05:16.434
I just-- I couldn't
admit it then,

1:05:16.477 --> 1:05:17.565
but you were right.

1:05:17.609 --> 1:05:18.436
Maybe I wasn't.

1:05:19.916 --> 1:05:21.047
Look, could we just

1:05:21.091 --> 1:05:23.223
forget the last few days
and try again?

1:05:23.267 --> 1:05:25.834
Oh.

1:05:25.878 --> 1:05:28.620
Actually, I... I can't.

1:05:29.969 --> 1:05:31.318
What, because of that guy
you were kissing?

1:05:31.362 --> 1:05:32.102
You saw that?

1:05:34.278 --> 1:05:35.975
That turned out
to be a mistake, too.

1:05:36.019 --> 1:05:37.716
Sorry.

1:05:37.759 --> 1:05:39.022
No, it's okay.

1:05:39.065 --> 1:05:41.981
I'm actually taking a holiday
from dating.

1:05:42.025 --> 1:05:43.461
And you know me
and my holidays.

1:05:44.766 --> 1:05:46.507
Well...

1:05:46.551 --> 1:05:48.248
if you ever need glasses...

1:05:48.292 --> 1:05:49.902
Ex-girlfriend discount?

1:05:50.990 --> 1:05:52.687
Always.

1:05:52.731 --> 1:05:53.993
Merry Christmas, Jessica.

1:05:54.037 --> 1:05:55.647
Merry Christmas.

1:06:01.131 --> 1:06:02.306
Bye.

1:06:07.441 --> 1:06:09.487
If you're here
to try to change her mind,

1:06:09.530 --> 1:06:11.489
I wouldn't bother.

1:06:51.181 --> 1:06:54.140
"...And this is my journey
to becoming a foster parent.

1:06:54.184 --> 1:06:57.709
One I've been wanting to take
for a very long time."

1:07:00.103 --> 1:07:02.366
This story's so good,
I want to cry.

1:07:02.409 --> 1:07:04.281
Yeah.

1:07:04.324 --> 1:07:05.978
In fact, everything
makes me want to cry.

1:07:06.022 --> 1:07:07.153
Come on, Mimi.

1:07:07.197 --> 1:07:08.067
Did you call him?

1:07:08.111 --> 1:07:09.199
No.

1:07:09.242 --> 1:07:10.417
-Just call him.
-Mimi.

1:07:10.461 --> 1:07:12.724
But I had such a good feeling
about him!

1:07:12.767 --> 1:07:15.596
Look, if it was meant to be,
it would've been, right?

1:07:15.640 --> 1:07:17.207
Now, you two get outta here.

1:07:18.686 --> 1:07:19.861
We said no presents.

1:07:19.905 --> 1:07:21.254
We say a lot of things.

1:07:21.298 --> 1:07:22.908
Merry Christmas.

1:07:22.951 --> 1:07:24.040
Call us the second
your audition's over.

1:07:24.083 --> 1:07:24.910
I will.

1:07:24.953 --> 1:07:26.216
Mm!

1:07:27.478 --> 1:07:28.696
Merry Christmas, Jess.

1:07:28.740 --> 1:07:29.784
Mimi, honey,
we really gotta hit the road.

1:07:29.828 --> 1:07:31.134
Wait, wait, wait.
One last thing.

1:07:31.177 --> 1:07:33.353
Ta-dah!

1:07:33.397 --> 1:07:34.615
Nice touch.

1:07:34.659 --> 1:07:36.052
-Merry Christmas, you two!
-Merry Christmas.

1:07:36.095 --> 1:07:38.315
Mm. Love you.
Drive safely!

1:07:49.108 --> 1:07:50.196
Okay, look.

1:07:50.240 --> 1:07:52.155
You've been doing this
forever, right?

1:07:52.198 --> 1:07:53.330
Is there any way

1:07:53.373 --> 1:07:54.722
you can play this by yourself

1:07:54.766 --> 1:07:57.160
and I promise
I will make it worth your while?

1:07:57.203 --> 1:07:59.945
New strings, new case,
you name it.

1:08:06.299 --> 1:08:08.258
Thank you.

1:08:08.301 --> 1:08:10.869
Next cellist.

1:08:10.912 --> 1:08:12.088
Okay.

1:08:15.395 --> 1:08:17.397
My name is Jessica Winthrop

1:08:17.441 --> 1:08:19.965
and I've been avoiding
this moment for way too long,

1:08:20.008 --> 1:08:21.227
but it's Christmas

1:08:21.271 --> 1:08:23.360
and this is my gift
to myself.

1:08:23.403 --> 1:08:25.623
We're hoping
it's your gift to us as well.

1:08:27.712 --> 1:08:29.627
Whenever you're ready.

1:08:29.670 --> 1:08:31.368
Right.

1:08:31.411 --> 1:08:32.891
Ahem.

1:08:59.265 --> 1:09:00.832
You put it on the mantle?

1:09:00.875 --> 1:09:03.400
Text me a picture.

1:09:03.443 --> 1:09:05.315
I miss you, too, Mom.

1:09:06.620 --> 1:09:07.969
Merry Christmas, Lug Nut!

1:09:08.013 --> 1:09:09.623
Merry, merry,
Messy Jessie!

1:09:09.667 --> 1:09:10.885
How are you?

1:09:10.929 --> 1:09:12.060
I'm great.

1:09:12.104 --> 1:09:13.279
I got your card.

1:09:13.323 --> 1:09:14.889
I want you to know
it meant a lot to me.

1:09:14.933 --> 1:09:16.587
I am so proud of you

1:09:16.630 --> 1:09:18.545
and I just--
I want you to be safe.

1:09:18.589 --> 1:09:20.156
Thanks, sis. I am.

1:09:20.199 --> 1:09:22.680
Hey, um,
this is gonna sound weird,

1:09:22.723 --> 1:09:25.770
but your card kind of set off
a chain of events for me.

1:09:25.813 --> 1:09:27.293
There was someone I wanted
to get to know here

1:09:27.337 --> 1:09:29.295
and your card
got us talking,

1:09:29.339 --> 1:09:30.992
so I wonder if I could
cross a few things off

1:09:31.036 --> 1:09:31.950
and give it to her?

1:09:31.993 --> 1:09:33.038
Absolutely.

1:09:33.081 --> 1:09:34.996
Who is she?

1:09:35.040 --> 1:09:36.302
A private.

1:09:36.346 --> 1:09:37.347
And it's private.

1:09:37.390 --> 1:09:39.175
-Oh!
-For now.

1:09:40.350 --> 1:09:41.568
Everything good at home?

1:09:41.612 --> 1:09:43.004
You are looking at

1:09:43.048 --> 1:09:45.268
the new substitute
second chair

1:09:45.311 --> 1:09:47.966
of the Chicago
Heritage Orchestra.

1:09:48.009 --> 1:09:49.489
Jess!

1:09:49.533 --> 1:09:50.925
That's amazing!

1:09:50.969 --> 1:09:52.840
When you come back,
you'll come see me play, yeah?

1:09:52.884 --> 1:09:54.538
I can't wait.

1:09:54.581 --> 1:09:57.062
Okay, I love you.
Merry Christmas! Mwah!

1:10:06.680 --> 1:10:08.900
This is it.

1:10:08.943 --> 1:10:11.076
Looks nice.

1:10:13.078 --> 1:10:14.732
And it's close by,

1:10:14.775 --> 1:10:16.212
so if they're walking him,

1:10:16.255 --> 1:10:17.474
we might see him.

1:10:17.517 --> 1:10:18.518
Yeah.

1:10:18.562 --> 1:10:19.780
Blitzen...

1:10:19.824 --> 1:10:22.348
I want you to have
a happy life.

1:10:22.392 --> 1:10:24.089
But if you don't like them,
you tell me,

1:10:24.132 --> 1:10:25.221
and we'll go right home.

1:10:25.264 --> 1:10:26.613
-Home.
-What?

1:10:26.657 --> 1:10:28.615
Well, you said "home."

1:10:28.659 --> 1:10:30.400
Well, he knows what I meant.

1:10:32.140 --> 1:10:34.273
Yeah. Yeah, I think he does.

1:10:41.759 --> 1:10:43.717
I can't do this.

1:10:45.850 --> 1:10:47.547
I won't do this.

1:10:51.464 --> 1:10:54.206
He's found his forever home.

1:10:54.250 --> 1:10:55.686
With me.

1:10:57.078 --> 1:10:59.385
I was hoping
you would say that.

1:10:59.429 --> 1:11:00.517
Really?

1:11:00.560 --> 1:11:02.475
Yeah.

1:11:02.519 --> 1:11:04.129
Come on, let's get outta here
before they see us.

1:11:06.262 --> 1:11:08.351
Just--
Just call her.

1:11:08.394 --> 1:11:09.569
Let it go, Primo.

1:11:10.701 --> 1:11:12.006
It wasn't meant to be.

1:11:12.050 --> 1:11:13.399
All right.
Are you sure?

1:11:13.443 --> 1:11:16.097
'Cause it lasted a lot longer
than five minutes.

1:11:17.273 --> 1:11:19.797
I get it. You're scared.
It's okay.

1:11:20.841 --> 1:11:22.190
Of what?

1:11:22.234 --> 1:11:23.670
Of "what if she's the one?"

1:11:23.714 --> 1:11:24.802
You're going to have to stop

1:11:24.845 --> 1:11:26.760
hiding behind
that camera of yours.

1:11:26.804 --> 1:11:28.719
You've spent so much time

1:11:28.762 --> 1:11:31.069
taking pictures
of other people's lives.

1:11:31.112 --> 1:11:34.159
How about
you start living your own?

1:11:34.202 --> 1:11:36.117
Come on.
Let's go.

1:11:47.433 --> 1:11:49.522
Ho, ho, ho!

1:11:49.566 --> 1:11:51.350
Merry Christmas!

1:11:51.394 --> 1:11:53.483
-Merry Christmas!
-Santa!

1:11:53.526 --> 1:11:55.093
Your picture made a story,

1:11:55.136 --> 1:11:57.269
and the story made
people find us!

1:11:57.313 --> 1:11:58.662
Really?

1:11:58.705 --> 1:12:00.533
I love you, Santa.

1:12:00.577 --> 1:12:02.840
Oh, I love you, too, buddy.

1:12:03.971 --> 1:12:06.147
Merry Christmas, Santa.

1:12:06.191 --> 1:12:07.627
I wanted to come over
and thank you.

1:12:07.671 --> 1:12:08.672
I'm Ruth Smith.

1:12:08.715 --> 1:12:10.326
Merry Christmas, Ruth.

1:12:10.369 --> 1:12:12.153
I'm glad you came.

1:12:12.197 --> 1:12:13.807
Seeing your photo

1:12:13.851 --> 1:12:15.940
with all those sweet faces
made me realize...

1:12:15.983 --> 1:12:17.942
what am I waiting for?

1:12:17.985 --> 1:12:19.639
I'm glad to hear that.

1:12:19.683 --> 1:12:22.599
I know how much
it means to these children.

1:12:23.904 --> 1:12:26.037
I don't think I've ever had
a happier Christmas.

1:12:26.080 --> 1:12:27.299
Hey! Come and get it!

1:12:27.343 --> 1:12:28.735
Christmas pizza
for everyone!

1:12:28.779 --> 1:12:31.521
-Oh!

1:12:31.564 --> 1:12:33.218
Red and green peppers.

1:12:33.261 --> 1:12:34.698
Santa?

1:12:34.741 --> 1:12:37.048
Isn't Mrs. Kringle with you?

1:12:38.179 --> 1:12:41.269
Well, uh... ahem.

1:12:41.313 --> 1:12:43.576
Mrs. Kringle

1:12:43.620 --> 1:12:45.143
had to go
back to the North Pole.

1:12:45.186 --> 1:12:47.275
When?

1:12:47.319 --> 1:12:48.886
Last night.

1:12:48.929 --> 1:12:50.453
But she was here this morning.

1:12:50.496 --> 1:12:51.454
She was?

1:12:51.497 --> 1:12:53.194
She brought us presents.

1:12:53.238 --> 1:12:54.326
Flutes.

1:12:54.370 --> 1:12:56.589
I opened one,
but I rewrapped it.

1:12:58.765 --> 1:13:00.332
Oh. Shh.

1:13:00.376 --> 1:13:01.420
I won't tell.

1:13:01.464 --> 1:13:02.813
Go on.
Go get some food.

1:13:02.856 --> 1:13:05.076
Okay. Can I have
a piece of cheese pizza?

1:13:06.773 --> 1:13:08.079
I'll give you the moon, Mary.

1:13:08.122 --> 1:13:09.428
I'll take it!

1:13:09.472 --> 1:13:11.169
Then what?

1:13:11.212 --> 1:13:13.084
Well, then you could swallow it

1:13:13.127 --> 1:13:15.042
and it'd all dissolve, see?

1:13:15.086 --> 1:13:16.522
And the moonbeams would

1:13:16.566 --> 1:13:18.611
shoot out of your fingers
and your toes

1:13:18.655 --> 1:13:21.658
and the ends of your hair.

1:13:21.701 --> 1:13:23.486
Am I talking too much?

1:13:23.529 --> 1:13:25.531
Yes!

1:13:25.575 --> 1:13:26.880
Why don't you kiss her

1:13:26.924 --> 1:13:28.099
instead of
talking her to death?

1:13:28.142 --> 1:13:29.492
How's that?

1:13:29.535 --> 1:13:30.797
Why don't you kiss her

1:13:30.841 --> 1:13:32.408
instead of
talking her to death?

1:13:34.975 --> 1:13:36.673
You want me to kiss her, huh?

1:13:36.716 --> 1:13:39.458
Ah, youth
is wasted on the wrong people!

1:14:08.052 --> 1:14:10.141
Merry Christmas.

1:14:14.493 --> 1:14:16.756
Grand fir.

1:14:16.800 --> 1:14:18.105
Strong.

1:14:18.149 --> 1:14:19.542
Unique.

1:14:19.585 --> 1:14:22.196
Perfect.

1:14:27.593 --> 1:14:29.334
Hey!

1:14:30.553 --> 1:14:31.815
I got something for you.

1:14:41.999 --> 1:14:43.914
You redacted
your Christmas card.

1:14:43.957 --> 1:14:46.090
Got permission
from the higher-ups.

1:14:47.221 --> 1:14:48.832
"Dear Private Dawson..."

1:14:50.137 --> 1:14:52.836
"I don't know when
we'll see each other again

1:14:52.879 --> 1:14:54.359
or what the future
will bring,

1:14:54.402 --> 1:14:56.579
but we have today,

1:14:56.622 --> 1:14:59.495
and we'll always
have our snowman...

1:14:59.538 --> 1:15:01.497
even when he melts."

1:15:03.499 --> 1:15:05.022
Are you trying
to make me cry again?

1:15:05.065 --> 1:15:06.458
Just the opposite.

1:15:07.851 --> 1:15:10.027
I have something for you, too.
My orders.

1:15:15.815 --> 1:15:17.774
What was that word
for gingerbread again?

1:15:17.817 --> 1:15:20.603
Leb-kitchen-platsen?

1:15:20.646 --> 1:15:22.561
Close enough.

1:15:22.605 --> 1:15:24.563
We might be spending
a lot of holidays together.

1:15:24.607 --> 1:15:26.652
I think I'm okay with that.

1:15:26.696 --> 1:15:28.175
Me too.

1:15:28.219 --> 1:15:30.134
Merry Christmas, Angie.

1:15:32.092 --> 1:15:33.877
Merry Christmas, Carter.

1:15:41.798 --> 1:15:43.147
Ahem.

1:15:45.802 --> 1:15:46.803
Those are for you.

1:15:51.416 --> 1:15:52.896
Merry Christmas Eve!

1:15:52.939 --> 1:15:54.375
Hi, Aunt Lila!

1:15:54.419 --> 1:15:55.942
Jessica! Oh!

1:15:55.986 --> 1:15:57.509
-Hey!
-Oh!

1:15:57.553 --> 1:15:59.467
What a beautiful tree.

1:15:59.511 --> 1:16:01.165
Trees are our thing, right?

1:16:01.208 --> 1:16:02.949
They are!

1:16:02.993 --> 1:16:04.298
I heard from Carter.

1:16:04.342 --> 1:16:06.083
Me too!
You got the door?

1:16:06.126 --> 1:16:07.911
-Yep.

1:16:07.954 --> 1:16:09.477
And guess what--
I think he has a girlfriend.

1:16:09.521 --> 1:16:10.522
He told you?

1:16:10.566 --> 1:16:11.610
He tells me everything.

1:16:12.916 --> 1:16:14.526
We'll set it here,

1:16:14.570 --> 1:16:16.354
and then you can help me
with the yams.

1:16:16.397 --> 1:16:17.181
You get the marshmallows?

1:16:17.224 --> 1:16:18.443
Of course.

1:16:18.486 --> 1:16:19.966
-Oh!

1:16:20.010 --> 1:16:21.272
Is this Blitzen?

1:16:21.315 --> 1:16:23.317
Welcome to the family, buddy.

1:16:23.361 --> 1:16:24.318
I have you to thank.

1:16:24.362 --> 1:16:25.450
Me?

1:16:25.493 --> 1:16:26.756
He came to the mailbox

1:16:26.799 --> 1:16:28.148
when I went to get
your Christmas card.

1:16:28.192 --> 1:16:29.802
-Oh!

1:16:29.846 --> 1:16:31.804
And that's Tom.

1:16:31.848 --> 1:16:33.676
He also came to the mailbox.

1:16:33.719 --> 1:16:36.026
I am so glad
I sent you that card.

1:16:36.069 --> 1:16:37.854
I am, too.

1:16:39.638 --> 1:16:40.770
Merry Christmas!

1:16:40.813 --> 1:16:42.380
-Merry Christmas!
-You must be Jessica.

1:16:42.423 --> 1:16:43.642
I am.

1:16:43.686 --> 1:16:45.426
It's such a pleasure
to finally meet you.

and the not-so-good times.

the backbone of this band,

and who have remained patient
while I...

that brought us here tonight.

1:19:05.392 --> 1:19:07.438
They have never lost
the talent and purpose

1:19:07.481 --> 1:19:08.831
that began in my basement.

1:19:08.874 --> 1:19:10.484
We were just dumb kids

1:19:10.528 --> 1:19:12.791
when we first
got up here and...

1:19:12.835 --> 1:19:15.054
I-I got off-track
a little bit,

1:19:15.098 --> 1:19:17.100
but we found our way back here,
right, guys?

1:19:17.143 --> 1:19:19.755

we're gonna play a new song.
