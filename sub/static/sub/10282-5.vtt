WEBVTT

00:04.738 --> 00:06.174
Previously on E.R.:

00:06.207 --> 00:07.141
Got it!

00:07.175 --> 00:07.675
They warned me about

00:07.708 --> 00:08.676
this place.

00:08.709 --> 00:10.244
They weren't kidding.

00:10.278 --> 00:12.046
So this is
the second time

00:12.080 --> 00:13.714
you've been wrong about
one of my patients today.

00:13.747 --> 00:15.149
You know what?
It's the last.

00:15.183 --> 00:16.817
I wonder where
the damn social worker is.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.552
Covering two hospitals
by herself

00:18.586 --> 00:20.388
till midnight.
That's my excuse
for being late.

00:20.421 --> 00:21.422
What's yours
for being an ass?

00:21.455 --> 00:23.424
Dr. Lewis?

00:23.457 --> 00:25.126
When do you need me
to start?

00:30.598 --> 00:32.466
Shock, shock,

00:32.500 --> 00:34.602
epi shock, lido shock,

00:34.635 --> 00:37.438
consider mag two grams,
shock,

00:37.471 --> 00:40.474
Procainamide, shock,
consider bicarb shock.

00:40.508 --> 00:43.244
epi shock, lido shock,

00:43.277 --> 00:45.246
consider mag two grams,
shock,

00:45.279 --> 00:47.448
lido shock,

00:47.481 --> 00:49.150
consider mag two grams,
shock,

00:49.183 --> 00:53.454
Procainamide, shock,
consider bicarb shock...

00:53.487 --> 00:55.289
Oh...

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:30.858 --> 01:35.396
( loud bang )
Shoot!

01:35.429 --> 01:36.230
You're going?

01:36.264 --> 01:37.498
Yeah.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.633
I'm sorry.
Rounds start at 7:00.

01:39.667 --> 01:41.902
It's barely even light out.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.872
Yeah, well, welcome to my life.

01:46.274 --> 01:47.508
Nice meeting you.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.913
Killing my plants,
ignoring my bills...

01:52.946 --> 01:54.382
get it together.

01:54.415 --> 01:55.649
What's the loading dose
of amiodarone?

01:55.683 --> 01:57.385
Neela, stop.

01:57.418 --> 01:58.486
And remind me to buy
toilet paper

01:58.519 --> 01:59.320
on the way home.

01:59.353 --> 02:00.588
This is weird.

02:00.621 --> 02:01.855
Don't you think
this is weird?

02:01.889 --> 02:03.457
Am I destined to spend
the rest of my youth

02:03.491 --> 02:04.325
in a fetid,
windowless hospital?

02:04.358 --> 02:05.693
You needed a job.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.661
Now you're here.
Quit whining about it.

02:07.695 --> 02:09.197
Yeah, but I'm not sure
if this is what I want.

02:09.229 --> 02:09.863
Well, fake it.

02:09.896 --> 02:11.265
Does everyone know

02:11.299 --> 02:12.600
that I had a complete meltdown
and quit?

02:12.633 --> 02:14.602
Hey, Dr. Jumbo Mart,
how you feeling?

02:17.605 --> 02:20.208
Need a doctor over here!

02:20.241 --> 02:23.211
15-year-old multiple G.S.W.
to the right chest.

02:23.211 --> 02:24.712
Tachy with shallow resps,

02:24.745 --> 02:26.314
18 gauge
in the right antecube.

02:26.347 --> 02:27.448
Hey, man, what's your name?

02:27.481 --> 02:28.582
He's apneic.
Throw me the bag.

02:28.616 --> 02:31.452
Sam, we need
a trauma room.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.786
Nothing's open, we've got 'em
lining the hallways.

02:32.820 --> 02:33.921
Get an attending.

02:33.954 --> 02:35.556
Lewis is doing
a subclavian,

02:35.589 --> 02:36.457
and Resneck's
coding a guy.

02:36.490 --> 02:37.858
He lost his pulse.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.227
RAY:
All right,
Starting compressions.

02:39.260 --> 02:39.960
8-O and a mac two.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.829
RAY:
Mig of epi.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.631
Have atropine
ready to go.

02:43.664 --> 02:44.932
Tube.
Neela,

02:44.965 --> 02:47.235
could you open
the shirt, please?

02:47.268 --> 02:48.502
I'm in.

02:48.536 --> 02:49.970
Neela,
listen to the chest.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.472
Neela, come on!

02:51.505 --> 02:52.673
SAM:
I.V.'s infiltrated.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.808
I'll give it endotrachially.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.844
No breath sounds
on the right.

02:56.877 --> 02:58.879
Okay, he needs
a chest tube.

03:00.648 --> 03:02.383
You carry a scalpel?

03:02.416 --> 03:04.252
RAY:
Yeah, bone saw's
too bulky.

03:04.285 --> 03:06.454
Could you take over
for me, please?

03:10.724 --> 03:11.925
No carotid.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.994
Atropine and another epi.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.863
40 French on a kelly,

03:15.896 --> 03:17.531
right here.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.604
Huge hemothorax.

03:25.606 --> 03:27.641
How come nobody told me you were
such a bad ass?

03:27.675 --> 03:29.443
ABBY:
Got a pulse.

03:29.477 --> 03:32.580
Oh, that's what I like to see,
interns with initiative.

03:32.613 --> 03:33.981
Come on, trauma two's open.

03:34.014 --> 03:35.916
Someone
call housekeeping!

03:38.586 --> 03:40.421
Next!

04:30.804 --> 04:32.072
...And finally,
in curtain three,

04:32.105 --> 04:33.607
we have three-year-old G.B.,

04:33.641 --> 04:34.608
here with R.W.

04:34.642 --> 04:35.876
R.W.?

04:35.909 --> 04:37.411
HIPPA's gone crazy
with patient privacy.

04:37.445 --> 04:38.946
What's R.W. stand for?

04:38.979 --> 04:40.781
Really Whiny?

04:40.814 --> 04:42.082
Refusal to walk.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.785
Refusal to walk
has its own abbreviation?

04:44.818 --> 04:45.886
LEWIS:
Neela,

04:45.919 --> 04:46.920
what's your differential?

04:46.954 --> 04:48.589
Septic hip.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.957
Intra-articular
infection,

04:49.990 --> 04:51.959
toxic synovitis,
osteo, sickle crisis

04:51.992 --> 04:52.960
and avascular
necrosis.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.362
What about the work up?

04:54.362 --> 04:55.629
C.B.C., Sed rate, cultures,

04:55.663 --> 04:57.365
X ray, ultrasound
and arthrocentesis

04:57.365 --> 04:57.931
if there's an effusion.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.433
First day back

04:59.467 --> 05:00.868
and she's showing up
the rest of you bums.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.636
Dr. Pratt, what's
the most common pathogen

05:02.670 --> 05:03.704
in septic arthritis?

05:03.737 --> 05:06.374
Dr. Barnett,
septic arthritis?

05:06.374 --> 05:08.742
Um, med students--
for a new dishwasher

05:08.776 --> 05:10.411
and a lifetime supply

05:10.444 --> 05:11.512
of Ensure-- what is
the most common bug

05:11.545 --> 05:12.513
in septic arthritis?

05:12.546 --> 05:13.447
Staph aureus.
Staph aureus.

05:13.481 --> 05:13.981
LEWIS:
Followed by Strep

05:14.014 --> 05:15.783
and Hemophilus.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.386
I've got to go. Chuck's in
the car with the baby.

05:18.419 --> 05:20.120
Guess the Dream Team's
reunited.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.489
( laughing ):
Cool.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.896
Good morning, Urbanus.

05:28.929 --> 05:31.699
Guess I'm with you
again?

05:31.732 --> 05:33.033
KOVAC:
Over 60 in triage--

05:33.066 --> 05:35.068
some of them were here
when I left last night.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.804
Okay, Pratt, run the board.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.772
Let's move
some patients, huh?

05:38.806 --> 05:40.040
Okay, people, come on,
listen up.

05:40.073 --> 05:41.709
For the past month,

05:41.742 --> 05:42.743
we've been
cutting you newbies
a lot of slack.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.011
You have?

05:44.044 --> 05:45.779
Today, the training wheels
come off.

05:45.813 --> 05:46.980
You're doctors now.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.616
Time to stop thinking
like med students

05:48.649 --> 05:50.418
and take on
a real patient load.
I want you

05:50.418 --> 05:54.955
to discharge 25 patients
this shift... each.

05:54.988 --> 05:55.823
25?

05:55.856 --> 05:57.491
Just two an hour.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.727
Med students, present
your patients to interns.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.962
Interns run your cases
by me or an attending
before ordering

06:01.995 --> 06:03.163
labs or scans.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.966
All right, here we go.
Ray,

06:05.999 --> 06:06.967
asthmatic in two.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.436
Abby, P.P.D. reading.

06:08.469 --> 06:09.670
Neela,

06:09.703 --> 06:11.004
teenager with a cough--
something easy

06:11.038 --> 06:12.072
to get you started.

06:12.105 --> 06:14.442
25 each and I'm counting.

06:14.442 --> 06:15.943
Only ones left.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.611
I guess that makes us
a team.

06:17.645 --> 06:18.812
Oh...

06:18.846 --> 06:21.014
Jane Figler,
fourth-year medical student.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.050
That was quite a flash
entrance you made.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.117
Thanks.

06:24.151 --> 06:25.018
With all the rumors
going around

06:25.052 --> 06:26.687
about how you freaked out,

06:26.720 --> 06:29.523
it's great how
you came in and...
Excuse me.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.593
Can you sign
my procedure log?

06:34.127 --> 06:35.596
Chest tube in your first
five minutes.

06:35.629 --> 06:36.196
You trying to impress me?

06:36.229 --> 06:37.698
Just so you know...

06:37.731 --> 06:39.199
I don't want or need you
to go easy on me.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.468
Believe me, I won't.

06:40.468 --> 06:41.969
If you need help,
just ask.

06:42.002 --> 06:45.005
Dude, I forgot--
Kuharczuk in curtain
four needs a pelvic.

06:45.038 --> 06:46.607
You're signing out
a pelvic? That's weak.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.008
I gotta get out of here, man.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.009
I'm back in 11 hours.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.177
She's yours.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.980
By the way-- nice move,
starting late.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.782
Makes internship shorter.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.049
Okay, so, I gotta ask.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.751
Why'd they kick you out
of Michigan?

06:57.785 --> 06:59.620
Chocolate? Okay.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.922
History of two ICU admissions

07:01.955 --> 07:03.957
and a prior intubation
a few months ago.

07:03.991 --> 07:05.192
We got to be aggressive
with this guy.

07:05.225 --> 07:06.694
Chuny, chocolate?

07:06.727 --> 07:08.228
Ah, no, thanks.
I'm trying to watch it.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.197
You? You can eat
whatever you want.

07:10.230 --> 07:11.499
Okay.

07:11.532 --> 07:12.733
What do you need, Ray?

07:12.766 --> 07:14.167
Could you please hit
our wheezer in three

07:14.201 --> 07:15.736
with 60 of pred?

07:15.769 --> 07:17.070
You got it.
All right.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.039
Lesson number one--
feed the nurses.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.708
It'll make your jobs
50% easier.

07:20.741 --> 07:21.942
Hi. Chocolate?

07:21.975 --> 07:23.644
Too early. We like bagels
in the morning.

07:23.677 --> 07:24.244
No, no, no. Come on,
take one for later.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.746
Ooh, hazelnut.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.815
Where do we keep
the peak flow meters?

07:27.848 --> 07:28.949
In drug lock up...

07:28.982 --> 07:30.984
and yes, I will get it
for you, Ray.

07:31.018 --> 07:33.654
You're the best, Sam.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.088
Well, the result
is borderline.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.157
But your use of steroids
and your recent incarceration

07:37.190 --> 07:38.526
put you
at increased risk.

07:38.526 --> 07:39.527
For what?

07:39.560 --> 07:40.628
TB.

07:40.661 --> 07:41.662
So I do have it.

07:41.695 --> 07:42.763
Not necessarily.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.598
Okay, can I see
a doctor?

07:44.632 --> 07:45.833
Sir, I am the doctor.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.234
We're going to get you
a chest X-ray

07:47.267 --> 07:48.936
and a couple more tests.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.538
So, do we call it positive
and treat with I.N.H.?

07:50.571 --> 07:52.005
Let's see what
the chest X-ray says.

07:52.039 --> 07:53.273
Does a positive P.P.D.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.909
involve type-3 or type-4
hypersensitivity?

07:55.943 --> 07:58.078
Sorry. Obscure question.

07:58.111 --> 07:59.980
Just trying
to impress you.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.749
NEELA:
Community-acquired
pneumonia, mycoplasma,

08:01.782 --> 08:02.983
viral pneumonitis,
Reactive airways,

08:03.016 --> 08:05.085
pulmonary edema,
tracheal foreign body...

08:05.118 --> 08:06.787
Stop.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.122
His chest is clear;
it's a cold.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.791
Fluids, ibuprofen
and home.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.192
I've got a guy
with an equivocal P.P.D.

08:12.225 --> 08:13.794
and a butt-load
of risk factors--

08:13.827 --> 08:14.862
does he have to take I.N.H.?

08:14.895 --> 08:15.929
Well, call I.D.,
check it out.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.598
Okay, let's
check it out.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.800
No, no, he'll go look it up.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.268
Doesn't take two
of you to open a book.

08:21.301 --> 08:24.104
Delegate to your student
and find a new patient.

08:24.137 --> 08:25.839
Look at that;
look at Ray.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.641
He discharged
his second patient already.

08:27.675 --> 08:28.776
Come on,
pick it up, ladies.

08:28.809 --> 08:29.877
He's making you look bad.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.812
Need a doc over here.

08:31.845 --> 08:35.215
Hey, go.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.284
Dropped right in front of us,
transient L.O.C.

08:37.317 --> 08:38.885
Never even
signed in.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.220
Hello, my name
is Dr. Rasgotra,

08:40.253 --> 08:41.589
Can you tell me
your name?

08:41.621 --> 08:43.222
Juan Enriquez.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.958
Forgot to eat breakfast,
that's all.

08:44.992 --> 08:46.159
Let's get him up.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.160
Oh, he's bleeding.

08:47.194 --> 08:48.696
Pulse is racing.

08:48.729 --> 08:49.863
I'm okay...
Chuny, what's open?

08:49.897 --> 08:50.831
Exam two.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.834
I'm just gonna go home.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.604
What are the bruises from?

08:56.637 --> 08:58.205
I noticed them last night
on my legs,

08:58.238 --> 09:00.040
but I didn't really think
much of it.

09:00.073 --> 09:03.811
When I woke up
this morning, it
was much worse.

09:07.114 --> 09:08.916
Six-year-old with
a lead level of 59.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.050
The city notified
the family

09:10.083 --> 09:11.184
three weeks ago
to come in.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.219
Three weeks ago?

09:12.252 --> 09:13.220
Okay, what does that tell us?

09:13.253 --> 09:14.822
He's got bad parents?

09:14.855 --> 09:16.089
No, It tells us
his lead exposure is chronic--

09:16.123 --> 09:17.791
he's adapted to it.

09:17.825 --> 09:19.326
If he was acutely poisoned
he'd have symptoms

09:19.359 --> 09:20.994
and there's no way
parents would wait to come in.

09:21.028 --> 09:22.863
Does this case
belong in the E.R.?

09:22.896 --> 09:24.665
No. But they wouldn't wait
eight hours in this cesspool

09:24.698 --> 09:25.899
unless they didn't have
someplace else to go.

09:25.933 --> 09:26.867
System's broken, people.

09:26.900 --> 09:27.901
Can't blame the victims.

09:27.935 --> 09:32.239
Good morning, Mister... Lucas.

09:32.272 --> 09:33.874
I'm Dr. Barnett.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.809
Heard you have a lead problem.

09:35.843 --> 09:37.177
Am I getting a shot?

09:37.210 --> 09:38.746
No, man, we wouldn't do that
to you.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.648
They, uh,

09:40.648 --> 09:41.949
tested him at school.
I don't know
how he got it.

09:41.982 --> 09:44.184
The city will send someone
to your house

09:44.217 --> 09:45.786
to look
for lead sources.

09:45.819 --> 09:48.255
He's always been sick,
born early.

09:48.288 --> 09:50.691
But look at you now,
tough guy.

09:50.724 --> 09:51.258
You a pro football player?

09:51.291 --> 09:52.893
No.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.928
He had breathing problems
when he was a baby.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.296
How 'bout basketball?

09:56.329 --> 09:57.965
Aren't you the new point guard
for the Bulls?

09:57.998 --> 09:59.967
No, I'm in first grade.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.069
Lucas, dude,
you're playing it cool

10:02.102 --> 10:04.004
but I know you're famous.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.205
So I'm going to have to ask
for your autograph,

10:05.238 --> 10:06.306
okay?

10:06.339 --> 10:07.975
Do a quick head to toe,
all right?

10:13.246 --> 10:14.748
Hey, lead clinic, please.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.049
Oh, and he had a seizure
once when he was two

10:16.083 --> 10:17.350
when he was sick.

10:17.384 --> 10:18.952
Febrile seizure.
It's very common.

10:18.986 --> 10:22.389
Hey, it's Dr. Barnett
in the E.R.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.291
I have a seven-year-old
with elevated lead

10:24.324 --> 10:25.425
who needs chelation.

10:25.458 --> 10:28.361
Okay. Thank you
very much.

10:28.395 --> 10:32.299
Okay, you're all set.

10:32.332 --> 10:33.867
A nurse will walk you
over to the clinic.

10:33.901 --> 10:34.401
Okay. Thanks, Doc.

10:34.434 --> 10:36.704
Punch it.

10:36.737 --> 10:39.272
I'm going to sell
your autograph on eBay
for a million dollars.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.273
A billion dollars.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.909
All right.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.043
Let's go.

10:43.076 --> 10:45.946
Five minute discharge, boys.

10:45.979 --> 10:46.980
Watch and learn.

10:51.451 --> 10:53.020
URBANUS:
Are troponins useful

10:53.053 --> 10:56.256
in ruling out coronary aneurysms
in Kawasaki's?

10:56.289 --> 10:58.258
Aren't enough
good studies on kids.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.728
So, do ex-preemies have a
problem with lead metabolism?

11:00.728 --> 11:03.831
No. Patients will tell you all
kinds of irrelevant crap--

11:03.864 --> 11:05.165
they don't know
what's important.

11:05.198 --> 11:06.800
You were so patient
with the dad.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.068
Well, the key is to look like
you're listening

11:08.101 --> 11:09.269
while you're doing
your charting.

11:11.404 --> 11:12.773
Multitask.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.341
Guys, it is the key

11:14.374 --> 11:15.208
to survival in the E.R.

11:15.242 --> 11:18.846
Here you go.

11:18.879 --> 11:21.448
Is that really the best advice
you can come up with?

11:21.481 --> 11:22.349
Second best.

11:22.382 --> 11:23.884
First was feed the nurses.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.185
Well, they're students.

11:25.218 --> 11:26.419
They should focus
on taking a thorough history

11:26.453 --> 11:28.221
and learn about
efficiency later.

11:28.255 --> 11:31.224
Med school teaches them
to practice medicine
in fantasy land.

11:31.258 --> 11:32.860
We're never be able to clear out
that waiting room

11:32.893 --> 11:35.028
if it takes us two hours working
up a slam-dunk case.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.229
There's no such thing as
a slam dunk case.

11:36.263 --> 11:37.397
Not when you're
an intern.

11:37.430 --> 11:40.500
Suit up, we've got
a trauma coming.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.903
46-year-old jet ski crash.
Bluntinjuries to head and neck.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.772
Tachy and hypotensive,
78 palp.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.339
G.C.S. 1,1,1 in the field.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.240
Check on our asthmatic--

11:47.274 --> 11:48.842
this may take a while.

11:48.876 --> 11:50.978
Okay, on my count--
one, two, three.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.514
Got a 911 page-- looks like
I'm in the right place.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.883
Yeah. Jet ski accident.

11:55.916 --> 11:56.884
Abby, your patient.

11:56.917 --> 11:59.086
Too much trauma to the face.

11:59.119 --> 12:01.221
can't evaluate the airway.
!
Poor aeration.
He's going to need a crike.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.824
RAY:
Weak carotid.
Crike tray to me.

12:03.857 --> 12:05.893
Can I hear some vitals?
How's our access?

12:05.926 --> 12:06.526
One peripheral.

12:06.559 --> 12:07.394
Start another one.

12:07.427 --> 12:08.996
And hang a liter of L.R.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.463
Do we have a pressure yet?
Get the rapid infuser.

12:10.497 --> 12:11.464
His wife is here.

12:11.498 --> 12:12.299
You got this?

12:12.332 --> 12:13.901
WOMAN:
Oh, my God.

12:13.934 --> 12:14.802
Ma'am, why don't we
give the doctors

12:14.835 --> 12:16.203
a little room to work.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.370
I'll explain everything
to you outside.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.806
I'll take the airway.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.107
Why don't you call
the blood bank.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.109
Full trauma panel,
type and cross for six.

12:22.142 --> 12:23.476
Sat's only 84.

12:23.510 --> 12:24.544
We're going to need
a portable chest

12:24.577 --> 12:25.846
and respiratory down here.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.247
Get him a blanket,
he's cold.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.850
Hi. I need four units of
O-neg in the E.R. please.

12:29.883 --> 12:30.550
What happened
there, doctor?

12:30.583 --> 12:32.285
That was your patient.

12:32.319 --> 12:34.021
No. it's a trauma, no medical
record number yet. Thanks.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.823
Don't say please and thank
you to the blood bank

12:35.823 --> 12:37.090
and don't let the
boys bully you.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.826
ABBY:
I-I wasn't
letting the boys...

12:38.859 --> 12:40.828
You play with your hair
when you're nervous.
What?

12:40.828 --> 12:42.462
He's clamped down.
I can't get a vein.

12:42.495 --> 12:45.966
Get back in there.
Your patient needs
a central line.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.367
Chest X-ray's clear,

12:47.400 --> 12:50.137
C.T.'s negative, B.P. better
after two liters.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.505
What does that mean, huh?
Is it bad?

12:52.539 --> 12:54.541
It's too soon to make
any kind of diagnosis.

12:54.574 --> 12:56.009
Just hang in there,
Mr. Enriquez.

12:56.043 --> 12:58.078
Sounds like
the fluid helped you.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.847
You ordered CT, films
and labs

12:59.847 --> 13:01.014
without talking
to me first?

13:01.048 --> 13:02.415
You were busy
and it seemed urgent.

13:02.449 --> 13:03.884
Where's your student?

13:03.917 --> 13:05.853
She's in sutures,
taking out stitches.

13:05.886 --> 13:06.954
You know, I really
don't get it.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.321
You're proactive, delegating,

13:08.355 --> 13:11.859
and yet you're
still in last place.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.493
Here-- med refill,
five minutes, go.

13:13.526 --> 13:15.863
Ray and Abby are stuck
in the trauma,

13:15.863 --> 13:17.130
this is your chance
to catch up.

13:17.164 --> 13:18.231
Femoral's in.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.200
Sats down to 78.
Mosquito clamp.

13:20.233 --> 13:21.902
His neck's too mangled,
anatomy's distorted.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.570
Feel the landmarks.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.873
Jet skis account
for only 20%

13:25.906 --> 13:27.975
of boats but are involved
in 44% of injuries.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.209
Know why that is?

13:29.242 --> 13:30.443
Dr. Lockhart?
No. 3-O nylon.

13:30.477 --> 13:31.945
No is right.

13:31.979 --> 13:33.280
No throttle, no steering,
no way to stop.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.447
I still can't find...

13:34.481 --> 13:37.084
You're fine.
Make your cut,

13:37.117 --> 13:39.186
extend with the clamp.

13:39.219 --> 13:40.287
Good.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.121
Perfect.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.023
Insert the tube.

13:43.056 --> 13:45.158
So if this poor guy
hit a pylon

13:45.192 --> 13:48.195
driving his jet ski
30 miles an hour,

13:48.228 --> 13:50.297
what was the equivalent G-force
of the collision?

13:50.330 --> 13:51.564
Got it. Give me the bag.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.466
Seven Gs. This guy's
head was subjected

13:53.500 --> 13:55.402
to seven Gs of force.
Think about it.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.170
That's equivalent
to how many pounds?

13:57.204 --> 13:58.305
We're doctors, not physicists.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.440
Pressure's dropping.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.442
V tach. Lost the pulse.
Take the airway.

14:02.475 --> 14:04.344
Starting compressions.

14:04.377 --> 14:05.545
An impact
of 990 pounds

14:05.578 --> 14:06.947
dropped on his head.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.181
That's what you're up against.

14:08.215 --> 14:09.950
That's not all I'm up against.

14:09.983 --> 14:11.018
You're going to shock him?

14:11.051 --> 14:12.219
Charging at 200.

14:12.252 --> 14:13.620
Uh-oh, Lockhart,
watch yourself.

14:13.653 --> 14:14.922
I'm nowhere near the bed.
Exactly.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.023
Clear.
Was I supposed
to grab

14:16.056 --> 14:18.025
the paddles out
of his hands?

14:18.058 --> 14:19.326
Mig of epi, have lido on deck.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.928
You did it again.
Did what?

14:20.928 --> 14:21.929
The hair.

14:26.299 --> 14:27.600
I mean, eight years of school--

14:27.634 --> 14:29.336
most people would
just like suck it up.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.437
Diarrhea times 11 months.

14:30.470 --> 14:31.939
What'd your parents say?

14:31.972 --> 14:33.573
My dad would have
ripped my head off.

14:33.606 --> 14:37.077
Why don't you start
the history and I'll catch up.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.378
PRATT:
All right, guys,
talk to me.

14:38.411 --> 14:39.980
Homeless guy
with gnarly feet--

14:40.013 --> 14:41.114
clotrimazole,
new socks, home.

14:41.148 --> 14:42.115
Seven-year-old
with lice.

14:42.149 --> 14:43.283
Permethrin shampoo,

14:43.316 --> 14:45.052
wash all the linens,
repeat in a week.

14:45.085 --> 14:46.686
PRATT:
Good work, guys.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.288
Keep 'em coming.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.490
You're still in
the lead with 11.

14:50.523 --> 14:51.691
Abby's at seven, Neela four.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.526
Ray gets credit for those?

14:53.560 --> 14:55.428
He's in the trauma-- he didn't
even see those patients.

14:55.462 --> 14:56.663
He delegated.

14:56.696 --> 14:58.298
The students are
part of his team.

14:58.331 --> 14:59.432
That's not fair,
he's got two.

14:59.466 --> 15:01.101
Can you handle two students?

15:01.134 --> 15:02.002
JANE:
You better go
in with me.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.536
There's a patient

15:03.570 --> 15:05.205
crouched in the corner
and every time I go near her

15:05.238 --> 15:07.040
she starts like,
yelling in Chinese.

15:11.344 --> 15:12.980
That's galea we're looking at.
He's basically scalped.

15:12.980 --> 15:13.680
Doesn't have to be pretty,

15:13.713 --> 15:15.315
just tamponade the bleeding.

15:15.348 --> 15:16.984
He's maxed out on dopa,
pressure still sucks.

15:16.984 --> 15:18.218
Of course it does.
Why, Lockhart?

15:18.251 --> 15:19.252
Spinal shock.
Yep. No sympathetic tone.

15:19.286 --> 15:20.253
What do you want to do about it?

15:20.287 --> 15:21.989
Epi drip.
Why?

15:21.989 --> 15:23.290
Get the B.P. up,

15:23.323 --> 15:24.591
increase the cerebral
oxygen delivery.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.026
Right-- ready
for the cruel twist?

15:26.059 --> 15:27.194
Systolic's 58,
come on, guys.

15:27.227 --> 15:29.562
Epi drip, one mike
per kilo per minute.

15:29.596 --> 15:30.630
Didn't I just say that?

15:30.663 --> 15:31.564
Ischemic brain
needs oxygen.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.100
But did you know oxygen

15:33.133 --> 15:35.202
also forms free radicals
after traumatic injury?

15:35.235 --> 15:36.569
Mother nature is such a bitch.

15:36.603 --> 15:37.704
V tach.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.206
No pulse.

15:39.239 --> 15:41.341
Paddles to Lockhart.

15:41.374 --> 15:42.275
ABBY:
Charge at 360.

15:42.309 --> 15:44.211
Clear.

15:44.244 --> 15:46.046
Free radicals cause
secondary cell death.
You following?

15:46.079 --> 15:48.181
Clear.

15:48.215 --> 15:51.051
Can we take a break
from chemistry class
while we code him please?

15:51.084 --> 15:53.253
The difference between
a physician and a witch-doctor

15:53.286 --> 15:55.288
is an appreciation of the
science beneath the disease.

15:55.322 --> 15:57.090
These trauma algorithms
should be

15:57.124 --> 15:59.392
automatic
for you by now.

15:59.426 --> 16:00.627
Oh no... oh God.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.362
Barnett, take over
compressions.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.664
WOMAN:
Look at his face.

16:04.697 --> 16:06.566
CARTER:
His brain is

16:06.599 --> 16:08.068
gravely ill,

16:08.101 --> 16:10.403
and it's starting
to compromise his heart.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.039
I didn't see it happen.

16:12.072 --> 16:14.674
I told him not
to rent that thing.

16:14.707 --> 16:18.311
I'm sorry. His body
is shutting down.

16:18.345 --> 16:19.479
Going again.

16:19.512 --> 16:20.647
You know,
I was running this.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.282
Really?
I hadn't noticed. Clear.

16:23.283 --> 16:24.484
Procainamide.

16:26.119 --> 16:27.287
What?

16:27.320 --> 16:29.156
Fine. It's all yours.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.529
Clear.

16:39.266 --> 16:41.368
So why'd you decide
to come back then?

16:41.401 --> 16:43.636
It's not like anything changed.

16:43.670 --> 16:44.771
I don't know.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.339
Neela, knee sprain
won't leave

16:46.373 --> 16:48.775
until she gets a prescription
for some memory pill

16:48.808 --> 16:50.243
she saw on TV.

16:50.277 --> 16:51.311
Positive tox on
the kindergarten teacher.

16:51.344 --> 16:52.512
Thanks.

16:52.545 --> 16:53.513
Jane, get knee lady
out of here

16:53.546 --> 16:55.415
and meet me in curtain two.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.184
Yeah. What do you want me
to tell her about
the memory pill thing?

16:57.217 --> 16:58.785
It's not an acute issue,
she can ask her primary doc.

16:58.818 --> 17:00.253
Pratt, fix this order.

17:00.287 --> 17:01.354
And please teach your
interns the difference

17:01.388 --> 17:02.389
between micrograms
and milligrams.

17:02.422 --> 17:03.623
What do you want
me to do?

17:03.656 --> 17:04.324
I can't be with
them every minute.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.657
Excuse me.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.660
If I've made a mistake
on an order,

17:07.694 --> 17:09.695
I'd appreciate it very much
if you'd confront me directly.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.231
I'd like to be treated
the same as everybody else

17:11.263 --> 17:12.832
and subjected
to the same scrutiny.

17:12.865 --> 17:16.136
Neela, we weren't
talking about you.

17:16.169 --> 17:18.238
Oh.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.339
Pupils fixed and dilated.

17:20.373 --> 17:23.109
No gag, no corneals.

17:23.109 --> 17:25.178
ABBY:
Here. Sit down.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.314
Thank you.

17:29.249 --> 17:30.217
So what now?

17:30.250 --> 17:31.218
We wait.

17:31.251 --> 17:33.686
At least
he's in sinus.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.255
All that means is that the
brain's no longer capable

17:35.288 --> 17:36.856
of telling
the body to die.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.258
Kovac needs some help.

17:38.291 --> 17:39.559
I got it.

17:43.330 --> 17:46.133
Elena Flemming, 32,
poly-pharmacy overdose.

17:46.133 --> 17:47.834
Paramedics couldn't get a line.

17:47.867 --> 17:49.236
I'll give it a try.

17:49.269 --> 17:50.470
Elena, what'd you take?

17:50.503 --> 17:52.805
Just the stuff that was
in my cabinet.

17:52.839 --> 17:54.307
What was in
your cabinet?

17:54.341 --> 17:56.843
Usual stuff, I don't remember.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.378
Urbanus, catch the paramedics,

17:58.411 --> 18:00.380
see if they got
any meds from the home.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.282
What's your plan?

18:02.315 --> 18:04.317
C.B.C., lytes,
serum and urine tox,

18:04.351 --> 18:06.286
Tylenol and salicylate levels,

18:06.319 --> 18:07.520
activated charcoal
and K.U.B.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.256
to check for iron fragments.

18:09.289 --> 18:13.460
Good. And call psych
and social services.

18:13.493 --> 18:16.229
Elena, were you trying
to kill yourself?

18:16.263 --> 18:17.497
I don't know.

18:24.371 --> 18:26.339
Looks pretty rough in there.

18:26.373 --> 18:27.740
The guy is brain dead.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.242
Do they have kids?

18:29.276 --> 18:30.243
Three.

18:30.277 --> 18:31.244
They coming?

18:31.278 --> 18:32.579
No, they're too young.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.547
You okay?

18:34.581 --> 18:37.217
Yeah, just part of the job.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.686
Bruised guy's C.B.C.'s
finally back.

18:42.455 --> 18:43.890
It's full of blasts.

18:43.923 --> 18:46.326
You ever tell anyone they
had leukemia before?

18:46.359 --> 18:48.661
Part of the job.

18:48.695 --> 18:53.233
ICU can't find a bed
for our jet ski trauma

18:53.266 --> 18:55.235
and they're not expecting
to find one any time soon.

18:55.268 --> 18:56.636
Looks like this guy's
going to be with us for a while.

18:56.669 --> 18:59.406
Why don't you call social
services for the wife.

18:59.439 --> 19:00.240
Whoa. What are you guys

19:00.273 --> 19:01.208
still doing here?

19:01.241 --> 19:02.475
I can't send them out

19:02.509 --> 19:04.577
until the chart's signed
by an attending.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.413
Okay, a seven-year-old
was sent by the city

19:06.446 --> 19:07.914
for a lead level of 59.

19:07.947 --> 19:12.552
Asymptomatic, dispo to lead
clinic for chelation.

19:12.585 --> 19:14.287
Did you get a repeat level?

19:14.321 --> 19:16.223
Figured they'd
get it there.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.659
Uh, come on.

19:19.692 --> 19:20.860
Is that cool?

19:20.893 --> 19:22.795
No, Ray, that's not cool.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.497
You've been a doctor
for a month.

19:24.531 --> 19:26.599
You know that you can't
sign off on a patient

19:26.633 --> 19:28.568
before you run it
past an attending first.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.437
So why don't you to get
a repeat level,

19:30.470 --> 19:31.538
and then I'll
sign the chart.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.281
Where are you going?

19:41.314 --> 19:42.715
I need to go to church.

19:42.749 --> 19:43.716
You're too sick to go
anywhere right now.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.552
( muttering in Spanish )

19:45.585 --> 19:47.920
I need to talk to you about
the results of your blood test.

19:47.954 --> 19:50.590
Juan...

19:50.623 --> 19:52.692
I got one in my eye now.

19:52.725 --> 19:54.627
Look.

19:54.661 --> 19:56.796
Your platelet count
is very low.

19:56.829 --> 19:59.799
That's why you're
bleeding so easily.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.668
( muttering in Spanish )

20:01.701 --> 20:05.705
Juan, your blood smear showed
some abnormal white cells.

20:05.738 --> 20:09.876
The abnormal cells are
crowding out the healthy ones

20:09.909 --> 20:11.411
in your bone marrow.

20:11.444 --> 20:13.012
( muttering continues )

20:13.045 --> 20:14.947
Juan, please listen.

20:14.981 --> 20:16.749
We can help you.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.685
You can't... you can't help me.

20:18.718 --> 20:19.786
Nobody can.

20:19.819 --> 20:22.989
Yesterday I hit
a man with my car.

20:23.022 --> 20:24.857
It was an accident,

20:24.891 --> 20:27.360
but today I wake up like this.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.431
Your blood pressure's
still a bit low.

20:31.464 --> 20:32.565
You need to be in bed.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.367
I want to review your smear

20:34.401 --> 20:36.836
and check on a few more labs,
and then I'll be back

20:36.869 --> 20:39.272
to go over everything with you,
okay?

20:39.306 --> 20:40.707
( muttering in Spanish )

20:46.879 --> 20:49.282
Why didn't you tell him
he has leukemia?

20:54.521 --> 20:56.789
Overdose only had antacids
and a pretty full bottle

20:56.823 --> 20:58.558
of Benadryl
in the medicine cabinet.

20:58.591 --> 20:59.759
Okay, she'll sleep off
the antihistamine

20:59.792 --> 21:00.827
and be good to go.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.495
What the hell
is going on here?!

21:02.529 --> 21:04.063
I've been here for almost
four hours

21:04.096 --> 21:05.532
and there's nothing
wrong with me!

21:05.565 --> 21:07.334
Sir, we honestly don't know.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.669
You could have TB, even
though you don't feel sick.

21:09.702 --> 21:12.472
We are going to recommend
treatment for nine months.

21:12.505 --> 21:13.873
You want me to take medicine
for a disease

21:13.906 --> 21:15.375
you don't even know
I've got?

21:15.408 --> 21:16.709
Most people tolerate
the medicine well.

21:16.743 --> 21:17.710
There are risks however...

21:17.744 --> 21:19.646
You people are really something.

21:19.679 --> 21:20.647
Mr. Decoyte...

21:20.680 --> 21:22.014
I want a better doctor.

21:22.048 --> 21:23.383
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:23.416 --> 21:24.951
I'm Dr. Pratt.
Can I help you?

21:24.984 --> 21:25.952
I've been here
all day

21:25.985 --> 21:27.787
for a stupid skin test

21:27.820 --> 21:31.358
and no one here seems to know
if I've got TB or not.

21:31.358 --> 21:32.725
Sir, the safest thing
for us to do

21:32.759 --> 21:34.627
is to treat it as if
you do have TB.

21:34.661 --> 21:35.995
If I were in
your position, trust me,

21:36.028 --> 21:37.096
I would do
the same thing.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.932
Fine. Then get me out of here.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.901
PRATT:
Please, have a seat
in the waiting area.

21:41.934 --> 21:46.005
We'll get your discharge
paperwork and your prescription.

21:46.038 --> 21:49.609
A good doctor knows how to make
"I don't know" sound reassuring.

21:57.617 --> 22:00.853
Lymphoblastic leukemia has a
remission rate of over 80%.

22:00.887 --> 22:01.854
How'd he take it?

22:01.888 --> 22:03.055
Thought I should
know a bit

22:03.089 --> 22:04.424
about the treatment
before I tell him.

22:04.457 --> 22:05.858
Can you page
Oncology again?

22:05.892 --> 22:08.027
Okay, halftime score--
Ray 14, Neela seven.

22:08.060 --> 22:09.462
The nurses were
tied up in traumas.

22:09.496 --> 22:10.797
It slowed things down.

22:10.830 --> 22:11.798
Oh, so you're gonna
blame the nurses

22:11.831 --> 22:12.965
while you're
sitting here

22:12.999 --> 22:14.401
on your ass
browsing Medline?

22:14.401 --> 22:15.802
Ray's using the
same nurses

22:15.835 --> 22:17.770
and discharged twice
as many patients. My man.

22:17.804 --> 22:19.739
All right, no more
than 10 minutes in the room.

22:19.772 --> 22:21.708
At seven you start
saying your good-byes.

22:21.741 --> 22:23.976
Which means you better start
wrapping things up in five.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.011
Uh, there's...

22:25.044 --> 22:26.446
a jammed finger
in sutures.

22:26.479 --> 22:27.914
Go check it out.

22:27.947 --> 22:29.616
Ray, how is it that you
get lice and athletes foot

22:29.649 --> 22:31.418
and I get new-onset leukemia,
tertiary syphilis

22:31.418 --> 22:32.685
and a referral from Kazakhstan?

22:32.719 --> 22:34.954
Wow, you got some cool cases.

22:34.987 --> 22:36.423
Our boy in four.

22:36.423 --> 22:37.957
Think it could be
intussusception?

22:37.990 --> 22:40.527
You get jammed finger,
I get intussusception.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.795
Are you accusing me
of cherry-picking charts, Neela?

22:42.829 --> 22:44.431
That hurts.

22:44.464 --> 22:45.865
Evans Syndrome
with varicella,

22:45.898 --> 22:48.067
unexplained vision loss,
idiopathic proteinuria,

22:48.100 --> 22:50.970
LOC NOS, cystic
fibrosis with SBO.

22:51.003 --> 22:53.005
Oh, and drug-seeking heroin
addict with a butt abscess

22:53.039 --> 22:54.841
who threw an emesis basin
at my head.

22:54.874 --> 22:56.042
Yeah, she was a winner.

22:56.075 --> 22:57.777
Fine.
I'm just slow then.

22:57.810 --> 23:01.981
You're not slow, you're
just... differently-abled.

23:02.014 --> 23:03.883
Don't let Pratt
get to you, okay?

23:03.916 --> 23:06.753
Abby's slower than you are, not
that he'd ever call her on it.

23:06.786 --> 23:09.489
but attendings love her,
nurses protect her...

23:09.522 --> 23:11.724
Must be nice to be
the teacher's pet.

23:11.758 --> 23:13.092
Screw you, Ray.

23:13.125 --> 23:14.594
Oh, hi.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.028
Uh, good.
You're all here.

23:16.062 --> 23:18.130
We didn't get to finish
talking about my research

23:18.164 --> 23:19.098
with free radicals

23:19.131 --> 23:20.667
and superoxide dismutase.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.802
It's good stuff.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

23:22.835 --> 23:24.671
Come on, you might
learn something.

23:26.539 --> 23:27.774
Step into my office.

23:27.807 --> 23:28.941
Right over here.

23:32.011 --> 23:35.782
Free radicals are the link
to so many disease processes

23:35.815 --> 23:39.952
in the human body--
ischemia, cancer, aging...

23:39.986 --> 23:41.588
I think that's a
permanent marker.

23:41.621 --> 23:43.990
They form after tissue
is deprived of oxygen.

23:44.023 --> 23:45.492
Why are they bad?

23:45.492 --> 23:47.727
Lockhart, we went
over this in the trauma.

23:47.760 --> 23:48.895
We did?

23:48.928 --> 23:49.962
Okay.

23:49.996 --> 23:52.765
What happens
when the radical

23:52.799 --> 23:58.505
encounters mitochondria
of a healthy cell? Lockhart?

23:58.538 --> 24:00.573
Why don't you let me do
some research on this

24:00.607 --> 24:01.841
and I'll present to
you in the morning?

24:01.874 --> 24:02.875
Easy question

24:02.909 --> 24:05.645
and I just told you the answer.

24:05.678 --> 24:06.513
Okay.

24:06.513 --> 24:07.580
Let's try this.

24:07.614 --> 24:09.949
Draw an oxygen atom.

24:09.982 --> 24:11.083
I'm not trying
to trick you-- this is easy.

24:11.117 --> 24:13.920
Just draw
an oxygen atom.

24:16.856 --> 24:18.558
Look, you guys,

24:18.591 --> 24:21.093
everything that we do in E.R...

24:24.163 --> 24:28.167
every intervention,
ultimately

24:28.200 --> 24:32.705
operates at a molecular level.

24:32.739 --> 24:35.575
I don't understand
how any of you expects

24:35.608 --> 24:37.544
to manipulate
the complicated machinery

24:37.544 --> 24:38.711
of the human body

24:38.745 --> 24:40.547
if you don't
understand the basics.

24:44.617 --> 24:45.818
Okay.

24:51.924 --> 24:53.192
There.

24:53.225 --> 24:54.994
I've done
the hard part for you.

24:55.027 --> 24:57.063
That's
an oxygen atom.

24:57.096 --> 25:00.567
Now, all you have to do
is add the electrons.

25:03.235 --> 25:05.171
I have patients to see.

25:12.078 --> 25:13.980
You couldn't
tell, really.

25:14.013 --> 25:16.282
You didn't
even seem upset.

25:16.315 --> 25:18.184
I know how to draw
a damn oxygen atom.

25:18.217 --> 25:19.819
That guy just
gives me the creeps.

25:21.888 --> 25:23.923
Okay that's
truly disgusting.

25:23.956 --> 25:25.324
Look, don't knock it.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.727
It's fast, high in
protein and free.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.729
Sutures is a la casa,

25:29.762 --> 25:32.131
exam four, splint and home,

25:32.164 --> 25:34.867
and fever and weight loss is
just waiting on a chest film.

25:34.901 --> 25:37.637
Okay. Abby's 17, Neela 12--
that brings you to 21

25:37.670 --> 25:38.871
It's only 4:00.

25:38.905 --> 25:40.940
When I hit 25, can
I go home early?

25:40.973 --> 25:42.742
Dr. Lockhart,
what have you got?

25:42.775 --> 25:45.211
Diverticulitis versus
biliary colic in two.

25:45.244 --> 25:46.946
In four, M.I. versus reflux,

25:46.979 --> 25:49.649
and in three, sepsis
versus viral syndrome.

25:49.682 --> 25:50.983
In admit,
Abby versus Ray.

25:51.017 --> 25:52.885
Neela, you're getting
your ass kicked.

25:52.919 --> 25:55.354
Start making decisions and
move those patients out.

25:55.387 --> 25:58.224
Ray's logged 21 discharges
with three hours left.

25:58.257 --> 25:59.091
Guess 25 was too easy.

25:59.125 --> 26:00.159
Yeah, right.

26:00.192 --> 26:01.628
I better up the
target to 30.

26:01.661 --> 26:02.361
30?

26:02.394 --> 26:03.663
Hey, double your speed.

26:03.696 --> 26:04.296
You both
just might make it.

26:04.330 --> 26:05.665
TAGGART:
Pratt!

26:05.698 --> 26:06.866
Your lacrosse
player's sedated.

26:06.899 --> 26:08.334
Come do his lid lac.

26:08.367 --> 26:10.336
What? It wasn't like
it was my idea.

26:10.369 --> 26:11.738
Dr. Barnett?

26:11.771 --> 26:13.873
Wendall Meade,
Social Services.

26:13.906 --> 26:15.374
Yes, I paged you
like four times.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.109
Yeah. In like 15 minutes.

26:17.143 --> 26:18.711
If I don't answer you
right away, there's a reason.

26:18.745 --> 26:20.079
Okay. I need you

26:20.112 --> 26:22.248
to talk to
trauma one's wife.

26:22.281 --> 26:23.716
He's brain dead.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.752
Interesting name,
Trauma One.

26:25.785 --> 26:26.753
CARTER:
Ben Coleman.

26:26.786 --> 26:29.321
Wife's name is Stacy.

26:29.355 --> 26:30.723
He's an intern.

26:30.757 --> 26:33.059
I see, so referring
to patients by name

26:33.092 --> 26:36.663
instead of room assignment
is a second-year skill?

26:36.663 --> 26:38.297
Did you go though the Care
Pathway with Ms. Coleman?

26:38.330 --> 26:39.866
The what?

26:39.899 --> 26:42.068
The checklist that
systematically covers

26:42.101 --> 26:44.070
all post-mortem issues
with a patient's family.

26:44.103 --> 26:45.772
You need a list

26:45.805 --> 26:48.207
to check off questions
you'd ask anyway?

26:49.809 --> 26:51.210
I'll see her
when you're done.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.249
Contact dermatitis
versus candida.

26:57.283 --> 26:58.718
Call it dermatitis.

26:58.751 --> 27:00.820
Topical steroids
and send her home.

27:00.853 --> 27:02.021
If it resolves,
we were right.

27:02.054 --> 27:02.922
If it doesn't?

27:02.955 --> 27:04.056
She'll come back.

27:04.090 --> 27:05.758
Your overdose
is waking up

27:05.792 --> 27:07.727
and here's the U.A. on
the tarantula dealer.

27:07.760 --> 27:09.361
Ah... U.T.I. versus
kidney failure.

27:09.395 --> 27:12.064
If I'm right, she takes
antibiotics and gets better.

27:12.098 --> 27:14.366
If I'm wrong, she becomes
hyperkalemic and dies.

27:17.436 --> 27:19.271
I'm trying to embrace
uncertainty.

27:19.305 --> 27:20.773
Oh.

27:20.807 --> 27:22.074
How am I doing?

27:22.108 --> 27:24.243
Not so good.

27:26.178 --> 27:27.947
You know...

27:27.980 --> 27:31.317
you haven't had anything to
eat or drink all shift.

27:43.462 --> 27:45.932
Go to Oncology and get a
copy of the chemo protocols.

27:45.965 --> 27:47.399
Isn't that Oncology's job?

27:47.433 --> 27:48.735
They said it might be
a couple of hours

27:48.768 --> 27:50.169
before they get
to see him.

27:50.202 --> 27:51.303
I want to be prepared
to cover all the bases

27:51.337 --> 27:53.773
for when we go
back in there.

27:53.806 --> 27:55.174
Uh... I'm on
an E.R. rotation.

27:55.207 --> 27:57.109
Shouldn't I be,
like, cracking chests

27:57.143 --> 27:57.944
instead of making copies?

27:57.977 --> 27:58.978
I got a 15-year-old

27:59.011 --> 28:00.046
skateboarder
versus fire truck.

28:00.079 --> 28:01.080
Truck swerved
and missed him

28:01.113 --> 28:02.081
but the ladder
clipped his leg.

28:02.114 --> 28:03.883
Looks like an angulated tib-fib.

28:03.916 --> 28:05.484
Leave him there. We'll find him
an open stretch of hallway.

28:05.517 --> 28:06.886
I'll take this.
I've got it.

28:06.919 --> 28:08.387
My med student's
driving me mad.

28:08.420 --> 28:09.321
Wanna trade?

28:09.355 --> 28:10.890
Were we that annoying?

28:10.923 --> 28:13.192
I wasn't.
Hi. I'm Dr. Lockhart.

28:13.225 --> 28:14.761
Does your arm hurt?

28:14.794 --> 28:17.229
You got hit by a fire truck
and just broke a leg?

28:17.263 --> 28:18.230
Lucky guy.

28:18.264 --> 28:19.498
Hey!

28:19.531 --> 28:20.499
Hello, in there!

28:20.532 --> 28:21.901
We're your doctors.

28:21.934 --> 28:23.402
We'll try to keep this brief.

28:29.275 --> 28:31.343
My sister is coming.

28:35.414 --> 28:37.283
How am I going
to tell our kids?

28:37.316 --> 28:39.919
Well, the social worker
will be here to see you.

28:39.952 --> 28:42.922
She can help you
with all that.

28:42.955 --> 28:44.390
Would you like to
speak with clergy?

28:44.423 --> 28:46.926
Any denomination?

28:46.959 --> 28:48.360
Okay.

28:52.431 --> 28:54.400
I'm sorry to have
to bring this up so soon,

28:54.433 --> 28:55.802
but we only have
a limited amount of time

28:55.835 --> 28:57.036
to make this decision.

28:57.069 --> 28:58.470
Is it okay if I
don't tell them yet?

28:58.504 --> 29:01.007
Have you thought about
whether you'd like

29:01.040 --> 29:02.842
to donate your
husband's organs?

29:02.875 --> 29:04.476
...I think it's okay.

29:04.510 --> 29:06.813
Okay.

29:06.813 --> 29:08.347
Let them have
one last night

29:08.380 --> 29:10.249
before their lives
change forever.

29:23.329 --> 29:24.831
Well, you're looking better.

29:24.864 --> 29:26.298
( chuckles )

29:26.332 --> 29:28.968
Just don't make me drink
any more of that mud.

29:29.001 --> 29:31.170
Well, the
good news is...

29:31.203 --> 29:32.271
Your tox screen
came back negative

29:32.304 --> 29:33.973
and your EKG was normal,

29:34.006 --> 29:36.142
so, from a medical
standpoint, you're clear.

29:36.175 --> 29:37.443
Good.

29:37.476 --> 29:39.011
Can I get out of here?

29:40.412 --> 29:43.482
I wasn't trying
to commit suicide.

29:43.515 --> 29:45.251
What were you trying to do?

29:45.284 --> 29:46.485
Abby!

29:46.518 --> 29:48.254
is the baby in three
a real ALTE

29:48.287 --> 29:49.856
or just a
choking episode?

29:49.889 --> 29:51.457
I don't know. I
haven't presented him yet.

29:51.490 --> 29:53.592
The parents are refusing
blood draws and X rays.

29:53.625 --> 29:57.196
Okay. I'll, uh... I'll go
find them when I'm done.

29:57.229 --> 29:59.265
I need Psychiatry
to see you

29:59.298 --> 30:00.332
before I can
send you home.

30:00.366 --> 30:02.334
I'm not crazy.

30:02.368 --> 30:03.535
Just stupid.

30:03.569 --> 30:05.037
Abby!

30:05.071 --> 30:06.472
Is I.V. contrast contraindicated

30:06.505 --> 30:08.440
in someone with wheat
and peanut allergies?

30:08.474 --> 30:09.308
I don't think so.

30:09.341 --> 30:10.442
Can you find out?

30:10.476 --> 30:12.078
C.T.'s calling for your MVA.

30:12.111 --> 30:14.080
Okay, um, hold them off
and I'll look into it.

30:16.015 --> 30:20.186
I'm going to page Psych for you
and get you an ETA, okay?

30:22.254 --> 30:23.455
The condom broke.

30:24.423 --> 30:25.124
Abby.

30:25.157 --> 30:26.492
What?

30:26.525 --> 30:28.160
Your abdominal pain's
gonna leave AMA

30:28.194 --> 30:29.862
if he's not sent up
soon, that's what.

30:29.896 --> 30:32.231
I tried to admit to Medicine
as a calculous cholecystitis,

30:32.264 --> 30:33.132
but they think it might be

30:33.165 --> 30:34.000
a retrocecal appendix.

30:34.033 --> 30:35.501
Well, what do you think?

30:35.534 --> 30:37.937
I don't know. I'm waiting
for Surgery to see him.

30:37.970 --> 30:39.538
Keep it moving, Abby.
Three an hour now

30:39.571 --> 30:40.873
if you're
gonna make it.

30:40.907 --> 30:41.941
Thank you
for your concern.

30:45.544 --> 30:47.479
So, the condom broke?

30:50.416 --> 30:52.584
I'm a temp
at a commodities firm

30:52.618 --> 30:56.588
and I slept with one
of the traders last night.

30:56.622 --> 30:58.424
He left a note on my bed.

30:58.457 --> 31:01.527
"I got HIV.
See a doctor."

31:01.560 --> 31:02.929
Oh.

31:02.962 --> 31:04.130
Five years of needles

31:04.163 --> 31:05.932
and I managed
to stay negative

31:05.965 --> 31:08.334
and I cleaned myself up,
turned everything around

31:08.367 --> 31:11.370
and then because of one stupid
night, now I'm gonna get AIDS?

31:13.105 --> 31:14.540
I can't get sick.

31:14.573 --> 31:16.408
I have a kid.

31:16.442 --> 31:18.544
( pager ringing )

31:18.577 --> 31:20.212
( knocking )

31:25.417 --> 31:26.418
Okay.

31:28.587 --> 31:33.625
Just because you've been exposed
doesn't mean you're infected.

31:33.659 --> 31:37.096
The incidence of transmission
from one exposure

31:37.129 --> 31:38.530
is actually relatively low.

31:43.469 --> 31:44.403
You know,

31:44.436 --> 31:45.571
it might be better

31:45.604 --> 31:47.706
if I told him
he has leukemia alone.

31:47.739 --> 31:50.342
I wouldn't want to
cramp your style.

31:56.983 --> 31:58.450
Seen Juan Enriquez anywhere?

31:58.484 --> 32:00.486
That leukemia guy? He
was out here a while ago.

32:00.519 --> 32:01.988
He's gone.
I'm sure
he'll be back.

32:02.021 --> 32:03.522
There's another patient
in his bed.

32:03.555 --> 32:04.523
Nobody would have

32:04.556 --> 32:05.624
discharged him!

32:08.227 --> 32:08.995
Damn it!

32:08.995 --> 32:09.628
Doughnut?

32:09.661 --> 32:10.429
He's gone.
Who?

32:10.462 --> 32:11.463
My leukemia patient.

32:11.497 --> 32:13.065
I'm such an idiot.

32:13.099 --> 32:13.699
I hadn't even told
him he had cancer,

32:13.732 --> 32:15.334
but I think he knew.

32:15.367 --> 32:17.003
Okay, you're not making
a lot of sense right now.

32:17.036 --> 32:18.104
He thinks he's being
punished by God

32:18.137 --> 32:19.471
for something
that he did.

32:19.505 --> 32:20.672
Should have realized
he was a flight risk.

32:20.706 --> 32:22.274
No, no. If he was
set on splitting,

32:22.308 --> 32:23.742
there's nothing you could
have done about that.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.311
I could have told him
that it's treatable.

32:25.344 --> 32:27.213
He has a good shot at
complete remission.

32:27.246 --> 32:30.216
Look, there isn't enough time to
help the people who want help.

32:30.249 --> 32:32.384
Don't beat yourself up
over the people who don't.

32:32.418 --> 32:34.120
He was distraught,
and I left him alone

32:34.153 --> 32:35.587
so I could go
and do research.

32:35.621 --> 32:38.057
Dude, where'd you go?
Jane's gonna hang

32:38.090 --> 32:39.358
with us, okay?

32:39.391 --> 32:41.360
You seem stressed out.

32:41.393 --> 32:43.662
It's about time
for the nurses'
nighttime feeding.

32:43.695 --> 32:45.264
Better go.

32:47.399 --> 32:49.601
Beastie Boys.

32:49.635 --> 32:51.670
He's out.

32:53.772 --> 32:57.176
Have you ever heard of...

32:57.209 --> 32:59.211
prescribing prophylactic
triple cocktail

32:59.245 --> 33:01.047
after a known HIV exposure?

33:01.047 --> 33:03.149
Sure, the hospital
gives it to health
workers all the time

33:03.182 --> 33:04.383
for needle sticks.
I'm not talking about

33:04.416 --> 33:05.551
a health worker.

33:05.584 --> 33:07.286
One of my patients
had unprotected sex

33:07.319 --> 33:09.155
with an HIV-positive guy
last night.

33:09.188 --> 33:10.722
Nah, it's really
only available

33:10.756 --> 33:14.360
for occupational exposures--
too expensive.

33:14.393 --> 33:16.528
Okay, on my count,

33:16.562 --> 33:18.430
pull the distal
segment out and down

33:18.464 --> 33:20.399
while I give
counter traction.

33:21.300 --> 33:24.236
One, two, three.

33:24.270 --> 33:28.540
Only healthcare workers
are worthy of HIV prophylaxis?

33:28.574 --> 33:30.709
We can't give preventive meds
to every one-night stand

33:30.742 --> 33:33.379
when we still can't
afford to treat people
who are actually...

33:33.412 --> 33:34.680
I'm not talking about
every one-night stand.

33:34.713 --> 33:36.382
I'm talking
about one patient

33:36.415 --> 33:38.150
who's here now,
and she's asking
for my help.

33:38.184 --> 33:40.386
And what about the patient
who walks in tomorrow?

33:40.419 --> 33:42.521
And the next day?

33:42.554 --> 33:44.190
Put him in a long leg splint

33:44.223 --> 33:47.126
and stay with him
until he wakes up.

33:50.129 --> 33:51.363
The guy'd been here
for eight hours

33:51.397 --> 33:52.598
and hadn't been told
he had leukemia?

33:52.631 --> 33:54.266
What the hell were
you waiting for?

33:54.300 --> 33:55.501
Oncology couldn't
get down here,
and I was trying

33:55.534 --> 33:57.469
to figure out exactly
what to tell him.

33:57.503 --> 33:59.438
He wasn't gonna
hear anything after
you said cancer.

33:59.471 --> 34:01.740
He was distraught--
I thought it was important
I get my facts straight.

34:01.773 --> 34:04.110
Why didn't you call the
social worker, psych,
get a guard at the door?

34:04.110 --> 34:06.345
Because I thought
it was better for him...
No, no, it's not about him,

34:06.378 --> 34:08.414
it's about you and your
need to be perfect.

34:08.447 --> 34:10.815
You need to stop being
a slow A-plus and start
becoming a fast B,

34:10.849 --> 34:12.551
or you're not gonna make
it here as an intern.

34:12.583 --> 34:16.355
Now, find him before he
bleeds out and he dies.

34:16.388 --> 34:19.324
Yes, I'm looking
for funding

34:19.358 --> 34:22.161
for HIV medication
for an uninsured E.R. patient,

34:22.194 --> 34:23.795
so if anyone ever actually
checks this machine,

34:23.829 --> 34:25.831
please call Dr. Lockhart
in the E.R.

34:25.864 --> 34:28.367
What?

34:28.400 --> 34:30.768
I look at you and Ray--
you're both so confident
in the traumas...

34:30.802 --> 34:33.304
Neela, it's your first day--
give yourself at least a week

34:33.339 --> 34:34.639
to be better than
the rest of us.

34:34.672 --> 34:37.842
I don't even know
why I'm here.

34:37.876 --> 34:39.777
Listen, every shift
at about this time,

34:39.811 --> 34:42.148
I start fantasizing about
working in a tollbooth.

34:42.148 --> 34:44.516
Neela, what's going on with
that football player in three?

34:44.550 --> 34:45.817
Uh, knee pain times two days.

34:45.851 --> 34:48.454
No drawer sign,
no A.P. or lateral laxity.

34:48.487 --> 34:49.788
Point tenderness?

34:49.821 --> 34:51.190
When he's bearing weight.

34:51.223 --> 34:53.159
Rest,

34:53.159 --> 34:54.693
ice and an ace wrap, right?

34:54.726 --> 34:55.860
Yeah. Excuse me.

34:57.663 --> 34:59.365
...with my husband?
I'm sorry, Mrs...

34:59.398 --> 35:02.234
( screaming ):
No, you can't do this! No!

35:04.470 --> 35:06.872
Looking good today,
Dori. Donut?

35:06.905 --> 35:09.175
I'm not helping with
the dis-impaction.

35:09.208 --> 35:10.442
Donut?
Babinka?

35:10.476 --> 35:11.843
Don't act immune to my charms

35:11.877 --> 35:13.745
just because you brought
your own sweets.

35:13.779 --> 35:14.880
He does this every day?

35:14.913 --> 35:16.782
Twice. Start of each
nursing shift.

35:16.815 --> 35:18.217
And it actually works?
Apparently.

35:18.250 --> 35:19.751
Abby, you're
lagging.
Yeah, well,

35:19.785 --> 35:22.188
I have more patients
on the board than anyone else.

35:22.188 --> 35:24.290
Which is meaningless
if you can't dispo
any of them.

35:24.323 --> 35:26.225
You're taking up rooms,
jamming the flow.

35:26.258 --> 35:27.926
You know, yesterday
I got a hot M.I.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.328
to the cath lab
in 15 minutes,

35:29.361 --> 35:30.896
reduced a perilunate
dislocation,

35:30.929 --> 35:32.431
and caught a case of malaria.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.733
Today I'm in some kind
of bizarre vortex.

35:34.766 --> 35:36.768
Okay, okay, cough
times two days.

35:36.802 --> 35:37.903
In and out.
Doubt it.

35:37.936 --> 35:39.805
Probably turn into
myocarditis

35:39.838 --> 35:41.773
versus tracheo-esophogeal
fistula.

35:41.807 --> 35:43.375
You know, all of my patients
need three consults

35:43.409 --> 35:44.843
and a huge workup,
and then even then,

35:44.876 --> 35:46.845
there's no definitive
diagnosis.

35:46.878 --> 35:49.581
Well, I guess...
No! And I'm not gonna pretend
things are cut-and-dry

35:49.615 --> 35:51.250
just to get another
hash mark on your board.

35:51.283 --> 35:52.884
I just want
one patient today

35:52.918 --> 35:54.953
that has a clear problem
that I can help.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.922
Okay.
Okay.

36:01.227 --> 36:02.894
( clears throat )

36:02.928 --> 36:05.497
Sam, how come Brennan still
hasn't gone to the scanner?

36:05.531 --> 36:06.965
'Cause CT's been
backed up for hours.

36:06.998 --> 36:08.367
Charlie's the CT tech
from 3:00 to 11:00.

36:08.400 --> 36:09.935
He loves bear claws.

36:09.968 --> 36:11.903
The rest of the donuts
go to the nurses' station.

36:11.937 --> 36:14.273
Should I make sure someone sees
me so they know who it's from?

36:14.306 --> 36:16.442
Yeah.

36:16.475 --> 36:18.844
You don't find all this
wheeling and dealing
a little bit slimy?

36:18.877 --> 36:21.647
Yeah, but sometimes you
got to play some games
to get stuff done.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.315
Excuse me, ladies,
let's review the standings.

36:23.349 --> 36:24.383
Ray still in the lead

36:24.416 --> 36:25.584
with 25.
RAY:
Make that 26.

36:25.617 --> 36:29.588
Ah. Abby at 19,
Neela brings up the rear

36:29.621 --> 36:30.956
with 16.

36:30.989 --> 36:32.824
File this under Neela.

36:32.858 --> 36:34.260
And why would
you do that?

36:34.260 --> 36:34.993
Because you'll owe me.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.528
Hey.

36:36.562 --> 36:38.364
There's a patient
with an E.R. wrist band

36:38.397 --> 36:39.731
who's upstairs
in the chapel.

36:39.765 --> 36:41.500
Been up there
a couple of hours.

36:41.533 --> 36:43.902
Hey, where you going?
You're only at 16.

36:43.935 --> 36:45.771
Uh, Employee Health.

36:45.804 --> 36:48.440
This is Abby Lockhart
in the E.R.

36:48.474 --> 36:50.942
I've been stuck by a needle.

36:52.644 --> 36:53.812
Let's roll, guys.

36:53.845 --> 36:55.347
Curtain two needs
a thumb spica,

36:55.381 --> 36:56.982
and we need to take off
a toenail in four.

36:57.015 --> 36:59.785
Dr. Barnett,
did you fill this out?
What?

36:59.818 --> 37:01.487
This is the postmortem checklist
for the jet-ski guy

37:01.520 --> 37:03.755
in Trauma One.
Ah, yeah, yeah.

37:03.789 --> 37:05.991
And did you actually talk
to Stacy Coleman

37:06.024 --> 37:08.294
or did you just
fill this out
to save time?

37:08.327 --> 37:09.861
( chuckles ):
What?

37:09.895 --> 37:11.930
Well, you checked off
that she wanted to have

37:11.963 --> 37:13.832
her husband's organs donated.

37:13.865 --> 37:15.701
She said she never
consented to that.

37:15.734 --> 37:18.604
No-no-no-no-no.
I asked her all
the questions.

37:18.637 --> 37:19.838
Well, a transplant surgeon

37:19.871 --> 37:21.507
was just in there
prepping to harvest--

37:21.540 --> 37:23.675
she thought her husband
was getting better, so...

37:23.709 --> 37:28.547
Okay, can we talk about this
someplace else, please?

37:28.580 --> 37:29.615
UNOS has already been
on the phone

37:29.648 --> 37:30.949
with a college kid
from Madison

37:30.982 --> 37:32.384
who thought she was
gonna be getting a heart.

37:32.418 --> 37:33.819
Are you worried about
getting yelled at

37:33.852 --> 37:35.787
in front of some
medical students?
The lady said

37:35.821 --> 37:37.889
she was fine with it.
No, Ray, she did not!

37:37.923 --> 37:39.391
Did you take the time
to make sure...

37:39.425 --> 37:41.026
I asked her all
the questions.

37:41.059 --> 37:43.329
Did you take the time
to explain it to her?!
How am I supposed

37:43.362 --> 37:44.396
to take care of four
patients an hour...

37:44.430 --> 37:46.732
Nobody said
this job was easy!

37:46.765 --> 37:48.934
When you take shortcuts

37:48.967 --> 37:50.869
and you drop details,
people get hurt.

37:56.842 --> 38:00.479
We'll send this in
for hep B, hep C and HIV.

38:00.512 --> 38:02.681
You can call tomorrow
for results.

38:02.714 --> 38:06.885
And, uh... never stick your hand
in a full sharps container.

38:06.918 --> 38:09.020
Stupid.

38:10.389 --> 38:13.925
AZT and 3TC
in a combined pill.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.961
The other is your
protease inhibitor,

38:15.994 --> 38:17.529
B.I.D. on an empty stomach.

38:17.563 --> 38:19.698
Two quarts of water a day,
and we'll see you

38:19.731 --> 38:22.801
in two weeks
to check your LFTs.

38:27.839 --> 38:30.976
Juan...

38:31.009 --> 38:32.911
we've been looking
for you.
( whispering )

38:32.944 --> 38:36.448
Have you been down here
the whole time?

38:36.482 --> 38:38.650
( continues whispering )

38:38.684 --> 38:42.988
Juan, you have leukemia.

38:43.021 --> 38:45.957
Leukemia is
very treatable,

38:45.991 --> 38:48.560
and you have
an excellent chance of a cure.

38:56.101 --> 38:58.937
I know...

38:58.970 --> 39:02.941
it feels like something bigger
than you is making this happen.

39:02.974 --> 39:05.911
But something also led you here.

39:07.546 --> 39:10.616
We will help you
get through this.

39:13.952 --> 39:16.955
There's a reason why you came
to this hospital today.

39:26.898 --> 39:28.434
Hey.
Hi.

39:28.434 --> 39:30.135
I, uh, I heard you
got a needle stick.

39:30.168 --> 39:31.437
You okay?

39:31.437 --> 39:33.004
Oh, yeah.
I'm, yeah, fine.

39:33.038 --> 39:34.840
You want to go home early?

39:34.873 --> 39:37.042
No. I'm fine. Really.

39:37.075 --> 39:38.977
Excuse me.

39:40.446 --> 39:41.947
Hey, Wendall.
Yeah?

39:41.980 --> 39:43.482
Did you get to
see my overdose?

39:43.515 --> 39:44.716
Yeah, I left a note
in the chart.

39:44.750 --> 39:46.452
Elena's able to contract
for safety.

39:46.485 --> 39:47.919
I'm comfortable discharging
with outpatient follow-up.

39:47.953 --> 39:50.989
Great.
Listen, I heard
about your needle stick.

39:51.022 --> 39:52.458
Are you all right?
I am.

39:52.491 --> 39:54.893
Page me if you want
to talk.
I will.

39:54.926 --> 39:57.763
You're back.

39:57.796 --> 39:59.531
Can I do anything?

39:59.565 --> 40:01.600
Do you feel okay?
Yes, I'm fine.

40:01.633 --> 40:03.869
A little woozy from
all the blood they took, though.

40:03.902 --> 40:05.504
I'll get you some water.
Great.

40:05.537 --> 40:07.873
Or maybe how about an iced tea
from across the street?

40:07.906 --> 40:10.476
Yeah, you got it.
Thanks.

40:12.077 --> 40:14.045
Hey, Sam, did
the radial fracture
get ancef'd yet?

40:14.079 --> 40:15.614
Uh, yeah, just a minute.

40:15.647 --> 40:17.583
I got to give this
message to Ms. Coleman.

40:17.616 --> 40:19.551
Hey. I'll do it.

40:27.058 --> 40:28.994
Mrs. Coleman?

40:32.130 --> 40:36.067
They took him
to the morgue.

40:36.101 --> 40:37.969
Your sister called.

40:38.003 --> 40:41.172
She took your kids to
your house for the night.

40:44.843 --> 40:47.646
Hey, I guess...

40:47.679 --> 40:50.215
we had some kind
of misunderstanding
back there.

40:50.248 --> 40:53.652
I'm not even sure
what it was about.

40:56.655 --> 40:59.124
If there's anything I can do...

41:01.627 --> 41:03.695
Can I call you a cab
or something?

41:09.668 --> 41:11.870
I'm sorry for your loss.

41:16.608 --> 41:18.243
Just the man
I was looking for.

41:18.276 --> 41:20.145
Do you know how
often I hear that?

41:20.178 --> 41:21.613
Are you okay in there?

41:21.647 --> 41:23.615
Yes. It was just
a little mix-up.

41:23.649 --> 41:25.150
What've you got there?

41:25.183 --> 41:28.019
Um...

41:28.053 --> 41:30.922
I need a favor.

41:30.956 --> 41:33.692
I'm... into favors.

41:35.761 --> 41:38.263
These are for my
patient in Exam Three,
but as you can see,

41:38.296 --> 41:41.166
they have my
name on them.
HIV meds.

41:41.199 --> 41:42.834
Yeah.

41:44.269 --> 41:46.572
Do you have any friends
in the pharmacy

41:46.572 --> 41:49.240
that could doctor
those labels?

41:52.077 --> 41:55.180
Yeah, I think
I'm falling in love.

42:02.120 --> 42:04.089
How was your first day?

42:04.122 --> 42:05.290
Hard.

42:05.323 --> 42:06.625
You gonna come back
tomorrow?

42:06.658 --> 42:08.159
Yep.

42:08.193 --> 42:10.629
Juan Enriquez's priest called,
still no word from him.

42:10.662 --> 42:12.798
Actually, he's on
the oncology ward
starting chemo.

42:12.831 --> 42:14.265
I found him
in the chapel.

42:14.299 --> 42:15.934
( sighs ):
Oh, great.

42:15.967 --> 42:18.036
Hey, thanks for
your help today.

42:18.069 --> 42:19.905
Sure.

42:19.938 --> 42:20.806
You off?

42:20.839 --> 42:22.207
Yeah.

42:22.240 --> 42:24.075
Yeah, me, too.

42:24.109 --> 42:27.613
If you wait for a second,
I'll, uh, walk out with you.

42:27.613 --> 42:29.080
Okay.

42:29.114 --> 42:31.617
I, uh, think I hear
rounds starting.

42:31.617 --> 42:32.918
Just make sure
you drink

42:32.951 --> 42:34.653
at least two quarts
of water a day

42:34.686 --> 42:35.954
and see your doctor
in two weeks

42:35.987 --> 42:38.790
and get your
liver function tested.

42:38.824 --> 42:40.659
I don't know what to say.

42:40.692 --> 42:41.927
Thank you.

42:41.960 --> 42:43.228
Sure. Take care
of yourself, okay?

42:43.261 --> 42:44.996
Okay. Bye-bye.

42:45.030 --> 42:46.364
Bye.

42:46.397 --> 42:47.933
You have dinner plans
tonight?

42:47.966 --> 42:49.367
No.

42:49.400 --> 42:52.938
Maybe that was too subtle.

42:52.971 --> 42:55.340
Would you like to have dinner
with me tonight?

42:55.373 --> 42:57.208
It wasn't too subtle,
Urbanus, I got it.

42:57.242 --> 42:58.810
Answer's still no?

42:58.844 --> 43:00.946
Yeah.

43:02.047 --> 43:02.981
Okay.

43:03.014 --> 43:05.216
Good morning.

43:05.250 --> 43:06.685
Hey, you buy your
T-shirt like that

43:06.718 --> 43:07.986
or you just rip
it up yourself?

43:08.019 --> 43:10.288
Hey, I met
my discharge quota today.

43:10.321 --> 43:12.924
So did I.
Uh, not quite,
Dr. Barnett.

43:12.958 --> 43:14.292
29. You're one
short, buddy.

43:14.325 --> 43:16.327
After-work cocktail?

43:16.361 --> 43:17.896
Totally gross.
After that,

43:17.929 --> 43:19.164
let's go get
a real drink, then.

43:19.197 --> 43:22.000
Mm, not a chance.
I'm exhausted.

43:22.033 --> 43:25.036
Come on, guys,
Lewis is handing out
the paychecks today.

43:25.070 --> 43:27.405
How can he still have
so much energy after
a day like this?

43:27.438 --> 43:29.675
Well, work is easy
when you have the entire staff

43:29.675 --> 43:31.042
literally eating
out of your hand.

43:31.076 --> 43:32.678
I just don't understand
how he can finish

43:32.711 --> 43:34.245
all his work exactly
at the end of his shift.

43:34.279 --> 43:36.682
I still have, like, an hour's
worth of charting to do.

43:36.682 --> 43:39.284
Two hours.
Hello, Abby, Neela.
Survive?

43:39.317 --> 43:40.719
Okay, let's round,

43:40.752 --> 43:42.954
so the day crew
can get out of here.

43:42.988 --> 43:45.724
In two,
we have DZ with V and HA.

43:45.757 --> 43:47.826
Finishing a liter,
P.O. challenge and home.

43:47.859 --> 43:49.194
Oh, right, who can tell me

43:49.227 --> 43:51.029
what the criteria is
for scanning a headache.

43:51.062 --> 43:52.430
NEELA:
Worst headache
of a patient's life.

43:52.463 --> 43:53.398
ABBY:
Thunderclap onset.

43:53.431 --> 43:54.700
RAY:
Morning nausea.

43:54.700 --> 43:56.902
NEELA:
History of trauma.

43:57.305 --> 44:03.768
