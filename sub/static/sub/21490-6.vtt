16:47.201 --> 16:49.079
‐ "Happy Funeral, Karen."

16:49.079 --> 16:51.627
Well, I wonder who thought
of that snappy copy.

16:51.627 --> 16:53.756
‐ My husband.

16:53.756 --> 16:55.968
I don't wanna brag,
but have you all seen

16:55.968 --> 16:57.931
his new Lean Cuisine spots
where the single woman

16:57.931 --> 16:59.433
makes a noose out of linguini?

16:59.433 --> 17:01.062
[light chuckles]
‐ Well, have you seen

17:01.062 --> 17:02.523
my husband's commercial
for lady razors

17:02.523 --> 17:03.817
where the woman's a gorilla

17:03.817 --> 17:05.362
and she gets shot like Harambe?

17:05.362 --> 17:09.829
‐ Well, my husband's cock
is huge.

17:09.829 --> 17:11.750
‐ So how about you guys?
Any of you have jobs

17:11.750 --> 17:13.837
or interests or something?

17:13.837 --> 17:16.467
‐ There's only room for one
personality in a relationship.

17:16.467 --> 17:18.179
‐ You know it's working
when you vanish.

17:18.179 --> 17:19.974
It's like my husband's
spot for Yoplait

17:19.974 --> 17:22.646
where the woman gets so thin
that she disappears

17:22.646 --> 17:25.944
and the man says, "Now that's
a wife I don't wanna punch."

17:25.944 --> 17:27.364
[laughter]

17:27.364 --> 17:28.951
‐ I can't fucking do this.

17:28.951 --> 17:30.496
Excuse me.

17:30.496 --> 17:32.959
Todd, if I have to spend

17:32.959 --> 17:34.963
one more second
at the fucking wifey table,

17:34.963 --> 17:36.257
I'm gonna lose my mind.

17:36.257 --> 17:38.052
It's like gay "Get Out."

17:38.052 --> 17:40.348
And by the way, everyone‐‐
is everyone listening?

17:40.348 --> 17:44.315
Boobies was not Karen's
favorite restaurant!

17:47.195 --> 17:49.868
‐ Well, another fucking party
ruined by Sam.

17:52.540 --> 17:54.669
‐ Billy! Hey, Billy!

17:54.669 --> 17:56.840
Wait. What the hell
happened back there?

17:56.840 --> 18:00.263
‐ Look, work things and being
the quiet, supportive boyfriend,

18:00.263 --> 18:01.892
that is not me, okay?

18:01.892 --> 18:04.438
I'm Billy Epstein,
I am not Billy‐Yi Previn.

18:04.438 --> 18:07.194
‐ Whoever asked you to be
the quiet, supportive boyfriend?

18:07.194 --> 18:09.281
‐ Well, that's why you
broke up with Sam, right?

18:09.281 --> 18:11.202
Because he wasn't that.
‐ I broke up with Sam

18:11.202 --> 18:13.624
because he took a shit
in my boss' office.

18:13.624 --> 18:15.418
Don't fucking overthink this.

18:15.418 --> 18:17.130
I brought you because
you're the first boyfriend

18:17.130 --> 18:19.218
I'm actually excited
about showing off.

18:19.218 --> 18:21.598
‐ Well, that's not true,
because you brought Sam.

18:21.598 --> 18:25.397
‐ No, Sam showed up.
He crashed an office party.

18:25.397 --> 18:27.025
Wait, is that why
you showed up at my office

18:27.025 --> 18:29.363
with half‐frozen chicken wings?

18:29.363 --> 18:31.200
Bob from Accounting's still on
the fucking toilet

18:31.200 --> 18:33.539
from eating those.
‐ Well, that's not my fault

18:33.539 --> 18:35.375
because they don't tell you
how long to keep them

18:35.375 --> 18:36.962
in the microwave
because they just assume

18:36.962 --> 18:39.174
that you're gonna put them
in the oven.

18:39.174 --> 18:40.803
‐ [sighs]

18:40.803 --> 18:44.644
Um, I don't want you
to be anybody

18:44.644 --> 18:46.815
but your asshole self.

18:46.815 --> 18:49.487
I like you
for the asshole you are.

18:49.487 --> 18:51.616
‐ I'm telling you, though.
If I ever have to sit

18:51.616 --> 18:53.244
with the wifeys again,

18:53.244 --> 18:55.499
I'm gonna take a shit
in your office.

18:55.499 --> 18:57.920
‐ Fair.

19:02.262 --> 19:05.519
‐ [sighs]

19:05.519 --> 19:07.690
Ugh.
‐ What?

19:07.690 --> 19:10.571
‐ I can't believe
I wasted this suit on Karen.

19:14.954 --> 19:17.250
‐ Dusty?

19:17.250 --> 19:19.087
‐ Marigold.
‐ Oh!

19:19.087 --> 19:23.387
‐ Wow, wow, wow, wow!
‐ [laughing] Hi.

19:23.387 --> 19:25.976
‐ I'm so glad
you tracked me down.

19:25.976 --> 19:28.105
‐ Oh, well, thank you
for meeting me.

19:28.105 --> 19:30.151
‐ Well, thank you for leaving
your number

19:30.151 --> 19:32.280
at the juice bar where
I get my mail.

19:32.280 --> 19:34.368
‐ Oh, well, of course.
Why don't you have a phone?

19:34.368 --> 19:35.955
‐ Ah, freedom, Marigold.

19:35.955 --> 19:38.502
I'm a bird,
constantly taking wing.

19:38.502 --> 19:40.255
I mean, there's no need
for a landline

19:40.255 --> 19:43.219
if you never really land.
‐ Oh.

19:43.219 --> 19:46.183
‐ Do you mind if I‐‐sort of‐‐

19:46.183 --> 19:47.854
vibe over here?

19:47.854 --> 19:50.358
‐ Oh, well, actually, I‐‐I‐‐

19:50.358 --> 19:51.820
I‐‐I‐‐I, um‐‐

19:51.820 --> 19:54.826
‐ Ooh, ooh, ooh.

19:54.826 --> 19:56.830
‐ Are you kidding?
‐ Does that ring any bells, huh?

19:56.830 --> 19:59.961
‐ Just an internal siren.
‐ Oh.

19:59.961 --> 20:03.092
Do you remember when
both your legs fell asleep

20:03.092 --> 20:05.263
when we were in the entangled
hammock position?

20:05.263 --> 20:07.894
‐ Oh, my God, the tangled ham‐‐
What was that illustrator

20:07.894 --> 20:09.772
even doing?
‐ I‐‐you know,

20:09.772 --> 20:11.066
sharpening his pencils?

20:11.066 --> 20:12.402
You know, I mean, obviously,

20:12.402 --> 20:13.947
he didn't have to
hold the position

20:13.947 --> 20:15.826
for an hour and a half,
right?

20:15.826 --> 20:17.580
‐ Oh...[murmurs].
‐ You know?

20:17.580 --> 20:19.500
‐ Dusty, can I ask you
a question?

20:19.500 --> 20:22.798
‐ Patchouli and mold.
You get used to it.

20:22.798 --> 20:25.846
‐ Do you ever miss
our wild, crazy youth?

20:25.846 --> 20:28.685
‐ No, I don't, man.
I'm unburdened, Marigold.

20:28.685 --> 20:30.940
You know? Always have been,
always will be.

20:30.940 --> 20:32.400
‐ Oh.
‐ You know? Yeah.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.154
‐ You are so lucky.
I have a family.

20:34.154 --> 20:35.991
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ I have a practice.

20:35.991 --> 20:37.327
‐ Practice. Ooh.
‐ I've got a mortgage.

20:37.327 --> 20:38.664
‐ Does that mean
you have a house?

20:38.664 --> 20:40.416
‐ Yes.
‐ What‐‐with a roof?

20:40.416 --> 20:42.462
‐ Well, of course.
‐ Holy‐‐Can I crash with you

20:42.462 --> 20:45.218
if it snows?
‐ What? No!

20:46.220 --> 20:49.101
‐ I understand.

20:49.101 --> 20:51.230
Then if it snows...

20:51.230 --> 20:53.234
could you buy me
a bottle of chocolate syrup

20:53.234 --> 20:54.946
to pour on the snow
for my breakfast?

20:54.946 --> 20:56.616
‐ Get a job!

20:56.616 --> 20:58.495
‐ Oh, my God. I can't believe

20:58.495 --> 21:01.835
that our first ever talk show
appearance is on ESPN

21:01.835 --> 21:04.716
and that the project
we're plugging is my dogs.

21:08.389 --> 21:10.644
‐ That's a lot of soda.
‐ I know.

21:10.644 --> 21:13.399
I get nervous.
This helps, for some reason.

21:13.399 --> 21:15.111
[burps] Oh, my God.
Excuse me.

21:15.111 --> 21:16.698
I know‐‐
‐ Very relatable.

21:16.698 --> 21:19.620
‐ Hey, hey! Football! Touchdown!
‐ Oh, hey!

21:19.620 --> 21:21.331
Yeah, winning! Right? Yeah.

21:21.331 --> 21:22.501
Uh, what do they say in
football?

21:22.501 --> 21:24.004
Oh, tailgate. Tailgate!

21:24.004 --> 21:25.131
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yep, dice,

21:25.131 --> 21:26.593
nothing but Netflix.

21:26.593 --> 21:28.012
‐ [burps] Oh, my God.
Excuse me.

21:28.012 --> 21:29.849
I've had a lot of soda.

21:29.849 --> 21:31.393
Uh, can I just run
to the ladies room, real quick?

21:31.393 --> 21:33.774
‐ Oh, absolutely.
Right this way, Billy.

21:33.774 --> 21:35.861
‐ Okay, let's go, guys.
Football and Touchdown.

21:35.861 --> 21:37.948
‐ Football, Touchdown.
‐ Football and Touchdown!

21:37.948 --> 21:39.451
‐ Get on up!
‐ Let's go, Football

21:39.451 --> 21:40.746
and Touchdown.
‐ Come on, let's go!

21:40.746 --> 21:41.873
‐ Look, Football and Touchdown,

21:41.873 --> 21:43.502
they are raring to go.

21:43.502 --> 21:46.131
‐ So, you big sports fans?
‐ Oh, my God.

21:46.131 --> 21:48.427
Huge. Me and Julie, both.
You know, some people

21:48.427 --> 21:50.891
know things about movies and TV
like who won

21:50.891 --> 21:52.937
the Best Supporting
Actress Oscar this year.

21:52.937 --> 21:55.024
Not us. It's all sports,
all the time.

21:55.024 --> 21:58.364
‐ Who did win?
Oh, Michelle Williams.

21:58.364 --> 22:01.203
‐ It's Viola Davis. Wasn't it?
Yes, it was. Yes.

22:01.203 --> 22:03.040
‐ Okay, they need to get
a mic level.

22:03.040 --> 22:05.086
Billy, can you count?
‐ Oh, sure, yeah.

22:05.086 --> 22:08.510
Ten, nine, eight‐‐
JULIE: Of course I hate sports.

22:08.510 --> 22:10.848
I hate them all.
We both do.

22:10.848 --> 22:13.352
Oh, those stupid hosts‐‐
Rape Rapely

22:13.352 --> 22:15.064
and
She Was Asking For It Jones.

22:15.064 --> 22:17.360
God, I wish I could
kill them all.

22:17.360 --> 22:18.738
[burps]

22:18.738 --> 22:21.160
Oh, and the burping.
[burps]

22:22.705 --> 22:24.709
‐ Is that your friend
who just accused us both

22:24.709 --> 22:26.713
of sexual assault
on a hot mic?

22:26.713 --> 22:30.011
‐ Yeah. She just jinxed,
and I'm not talking about

22:30.011 --> 22:31.723
the 1982 Bette Midler film.

22:31.723 --> 22:33.434
It wasn't Bette's finest hour,

22:33.434 --> 22:34.645
but she didn't get the offer
she expected to

22:34.645 --> 22:35.856
after "The Rose."

22:35.856 --> 22:37.526
‐ Get the fuck out of here.

22:37.526 --> 22:40.031
‐ Fine. Let's go, dogs.
Let's go.

22:40.031 --> 22:41.618
I don't remember your names.

22:41.618 --> 22:43.287
Let's go.

22:43.287 --> 22:45.584
‐ Fuck those dogs.

22:45.584 --> 22:48.715
So, hey, how's your cousin
Karen doing since she retired?

22:48.715 --> 22:51.094
‐ Oh, you didn't hear?
She committed suicide.

22:52.388 --> 22:54.351
‐ Hey, what are you doing
back here‐‐

22:54.351 --> 22:56.564
Oh, no.

22:56.564 --> 22:58.568
They heard me, didn't they?

22:58.568 --> 22:59.862
‐ They sure did.

22:59.862 --> 23:01.114
‐ [sighs]

23:01.114 --> 23:03.035
Well, good thing I only peed.

23:03.035 --> 23:04.872
Hey, are you hungry?

23:04.872 --> 23:07.335
You wanna do wings at Boobies?
‐ I can do Boobies.

23:07.335 --> 23:09.381
‐ Let's do Boobies!
MAN: Wow!
