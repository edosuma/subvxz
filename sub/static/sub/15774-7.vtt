00:10.225 --> 00:12.293
Daffy: That's it! I figured it out.

00:12.334 --> 00:14.629
I finally know what I want
to do with my life.

00:15.067 --> 00:16.996
Be a professional basketball player.

00:17.219 --> 00:19.207
Bugs: You're 3 1/2 feet tall.

00:19.242 --> 00:21.694
Daffy:  You know,
you're a real dream killer.

00:21.728 --> 00:23.556
I hope you don't ever have children.

00:23.578 --> 00:25.235
Bugs: I thought you were a hairdresser.

00:25.282 --> 00:27.115
Daffy: It's time for a new challenge.

00:27.267 --> 00:28.884
And I can't find my scissors.

00:28.912 --> 00:32.212
I'll be a farmer,
work the land, feed the people.

00:32.244 --> 00:34.111
Bugs: They get up
at 4:00 in the morning.

00:34.143 --> 00:37.494
Daffy: Hmm. I know what I'll be--
a mountain climber!

00:37.507 --> 00:39.111
Bugs: Did you say climber?

00:39.133 --> 00:42.636
Daffy:  Climb...
large mountains...

00:42.662 --> 00:46.030
Scale...impossible peaks!

00:46.069 --> 00:48.201
Bugs: You can't even climb the stairs!

00:48.260 --> 00:50.326
Daffy: It's the altitude!

00:55.027 --> 00:57.423
I've reached the summit!

00:57.447 --> 00:59.281
What a view!

01:12.904 --> 01:17.877
Original Air Date:
November 17, 2012

01:24.417 --> 01:26.581
Julie: Thank you for calling
Trans Visitron Cable.

01:26.615 --> 01:29.383
How may I offer you
excellent service today?

01:29.417 --> 01:31.352
Cecil: Good morning, Julie.

01:31.386 --> 01:34.121
Do you know why I'm smiling?

01:34.156 --> 01:35.823
Because it's Monday.

01:35.857 --> 01:40.861
And that's the day I randomly
select one of our customers

01:40.895 --> 01:43.930
and turn off their cable.

01:46.825 --> 01:52.122
Let's see who is today's
unlucky customer!

01:52.169 --> 01:55.707
Announcer: <i>And we're all set to go.
It's game one of the finals.</i>

01:55.741 --> 01:58.275
<i>We have two evenly matched teams.</i>

01:58.309 --> 01:59.676
Bugs: Here we go.

01:59.710 --> 02:01.452
Announcer [Over TV}: <i>And here's the tip--</i>

02:01.468 --> 02:03.186
Bugs: What?!

02:03.241 --> 02:06.608
No, no, no, no, no, no!
This can't be happening!

02:08.717 --> 02:11.719
Cecil: Let the fun begin!

02:12.065 --> 02:15.100
Thank you for calling
Trans Visitron Cable.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.925
<i>Please hold
while we access your account.</i>

02:19.594 --> 02:21.428
<i>Thank you for holding.</i>

02:21.462 --> 02:25.344
<i>The name associated with
this account is Buges Buney.</i>

02:25.422 --> 02:27.580
- <i>Is this correct?</i>
Bugs: Yes.

02:27.619 --> 02:30.570
Cecil: Thanks, Mr. Buney.

02:30.605 --> 02:34.608
<i>Please tell us in a few words why you are
calling so we may better assist you.</i>

02:34.642 --> 02:37.410
<i>You can say simple phrases
like, "Pay my bill",</i>

02:37.445 --> 02:40.847
- <i>or, "My cable's out".</i>
Bugs: My cable's out.

02:40.882 --> 02:44.228
Cecil: I understand you want
to terminate your cable service.

02:44.259 --> 02:45.594
- <i>Is this correct?</i>
Bugs: What?!

02:45.645 --> 02:47.413
No! This is not correct!

02:47.525 --> 02:50.393
Oh, this is a good one.

02:50.466 --> 02:52.361
Bugs : <i>My cable is out!</i>

02:52.415 --> 02:55.394
I'm sorry. I'm having
trouble understanding you.

02:55.429 --> 02:57.780
- Please try again later. Good-bye.
- Bugs : <i>What?</i>

02:57.796 --> 02:59.064
<i>No, no, no!</i>

02:59.098 --> 03:02.613
Let's see how long
it takes him to call back.

03:02.629 --> 03:04.169
Bugs: They hung up on me!

03:04.203 --> 03:06.898
Daffy: I'm not surprised.
You were yelling at them.

03:06.944 --> 03:08.478
So much hostility.

03:08.708 --> 03:10.609
Seriously, do not have children.

03:10.643 --> 03:14.246
Cecil: 7, 8, 9--

03:15.440 --> 03:17.150
Huh, faster than I thought.

03:17.212 --> 03:19.518
That Mr. Buney's
a real feisty one.

03:19.552 --> 03:22.005
Thank you for calling Trans Visitron.

03:22.044 --> 03:26.052
My name is Cecil. How can I
offer you excellent service?

03:26.106 --> 03:28.191
Bugs: Oh, hi, yes, my cable went out...

03:28.238 --> 03:30.667
and it's game one of the finals
and I'm missing it.

03:30.732 --> 03:33.363
Cecil: Oh, dear. Well...

03:33.394 --> 03:36.980
I'd be happy to send a technician
to your home...tomorrow.

03:37.039 --> 03:39.527
Bugs: Tomorrow?! The game's on now!

03:39.551 --> 03:42.573
Can't you press a button
and turn my cable back on?

03:42.607 --> 03:45.009
Cecil:  Oh, Mr. Buney.

03:45.043 --> 03:48.045
Do you really think I can
just turn your cable

03:48.079 --> 03:50.647
on and off with the click of a mouse?

03:50.681 --> 03:53.101
Bugs: Fine! I'll take
the appointment tomorrow.

03:53.148 --> 03:54.715
At least I'll see game two.

03:54.757 --> 03:57.467
Cecil: Okey doke.
A technician will be there

03:57.506 --> 04:00.655
some time between
8:00 A.M. and 6:00 P.M.

04:00.690 --> 04:02.251
Bugs: But that's all day!

04:03.926 --> 04:05.326
Cecil: And just a friendly reminder,

04:05.360 --> 04:07.995
someone does need to be home
during those hours.

04:08.029 --> 04:10.363
Anything else I can help you with?

04:10.425 --> 04:12.092
Bugs: No, you've done enough.

04:12.134 --> 04:14.306
Did I provide you
with excellent service?

04:14.400 --> 04:16.290
Yes. Beyond excellent.

04:16.305 --> 04:17.870
Cecil: Thank you.
Daffy: Who was that?

04:17.906 --> 04:19.874
Bugs: A customer service representative.

04:19.908 --> 04:22.577
You know, someone whose job it
is to make people miserable.

04:22.611 --> 04:27.001
Daffy:  <i>You can get
paid to make people miserable?</i>

04:27.071 --> 04:29.785
All these years,
I've been doing it for free.

04:29.820 --> 04:31.987
Here, you go be an underwater welder.

04:32.022 --> 04:35.791
I think I just found
what I was born to do.

04:35.816 --> 04:37.311
Get ready, people.

04:37.342 --> 04:41.334
I'm about to make you
a whole lot more miserabler....

04:41.385 --> 04:44.187
For money!

04:47.985 --> 04:50.238
Daffy: Tina.
Tina: What? I'm busy!

04:50.272 --> 04:53.897
Daffy: On a résumé, should everything
be in bold, everything be underlined,

04:53.898 --> 04:55.576
or everything be in italics?

04:55.611 --> 04:57.598
Lola: Hi!
Tina: Oh, hey, Lola.

04:57.627 --> 05:00.162
What do you need with a résumé?

05:00.204 --> 05:02.098
Lola: I need to make
a photo copy of my hand.

05:02.154 --> 05:03.602
Tina: What?
Daffy: Or do I just go for it...

05:03.625 --> 05:05.053
and do the whole thing in a fun font?

05:05.087 --> 05:06.621
Lola: There's this palm reader
that's really good,

05:06.655 --> 05:08.811
but she's in Tierra del Fuego,
so I need to send her

05:08.834 --> 05:10.163
a photo copy of my palm.

05:10.164 --> 05:12.359
- Excuse me, miss?
Tina: Yeah, give me a minute.

05:12.374 --> 05:14.638
- You can use that copier over there.
Lola: Thanks!

05:14.692 --> 05:16.164
I'm sorry, I'm kind of in a hurry.

05:16.198 --> 05:19.901
Daffy: Which font?
Old west or Triberica?

05:19.935 --> 05:22.035
Ooh, or Triberica grand?

05:22.088 --> 05:24.033
Hello! I need
a hundred copies of this.

05:24.056 --> 05:27.341
Tina: I said give me a minute!

05:27.409 --> 05:31.561
Daffy: Hmm, Tina and
Bugs, so much hostility.

05:31.585 --> 05:33.022
Lola: It says "Load paper"?

05:33.070 --> 05:35.038
Then load paper!

05:35.509 --> 05:36.876
Lola: Oh, thanks.

05:36.907 --> 05:38.266
- How about my hundred copies?

05:38.267 --> 05:40.588
Tina: How about I take your head
and shove it in that machine...

05:40.622 --> 05:42.394
and make a hundred copies
of your stupid face?

05:42.411 --> 05:43.878
You got time for that?

05:44.593 --> 05:47.862
- Tina, what was that about?
Tina: That guy was being a jerk.

05:47.896 --> 05:50.631
He was a customer.
So put a smile on your face.

05:50.665 --> 05:53.768
Tina: Easy for you to say! You don't
have to deal with these people.

05:53.802 --> 05:56.938
Tina, I'm afraid until
you can become...

05:56.972 --> 05:58.907
a little more positive and upbeat,

05:58.941 --> 06:02.745
I have no choice but to suspend you.

06:02.766 --> 06:05.502
Tina: But that's not my personality.

06:05.851 --> 06:08.452
How am supposed to be
positive and upbeat?

06:08.487 --> 06:11.889
I don't know.
Find someone to teach you.

06:11.971 --> 06:13.705
Tina: Positive and upbeat.

06:13.732 --> 06:16.264
What kind of nitwit's
always positive and upbeat?

06:16.383 --> 06:18.068
Lola: Toner exploded!

06:18.228 --> 06:20.329
Hmm. Looks like I have freckles.

06:20.368 --> 06:24.000
I've always wanted freckles.
Look, freckles!

06:26.000 --> 06:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:35.700 --> 06:37.501
Bugs: All right, it's 8:00.

06:37.536 --> 06:40.637
Someone will be here
between now and 6:00.

06:40.671 --> 06:42.794
Hopefully closer to now.

06:47.979 --> 06:50.111
Tina: Thanks again for
letting me pick your brain.

06:50.143 --> 06:52.971
Lola: Are you kidding? No one's ever
wanted to pick my brain before.

06:52.994 --> 06:56.688
Well, except for that one time when I
volunteered for those medical experiments.

06:58.557 --> 07:00.726
Tina: Whahey! That's our space!

07:00.794 --> 07:02.594
Lola: Oh, that's ok,
we'll find another one.

07:02.629 --> 07:03.695
Have a great day!

07:03.715 --> 07:06.292
Oh, I love your hat.

07:06.326 --> 07:08.483
Tina: You've gotta be kidding me.
He took your space.

07:08.515 --> 07:10.123
- That didn't bother you?
Lola: Ehh.

07:10.163 --> 07:11.842
There's plenty spots to go around.

07:11.873 --> 07:14.203
Besides, this one's much further away.

07:14.258 --> 07:15.657
Tina: What's good about that?

07:15.703 --> 07:18.978
Lola: Well, it gives me more time
to practice my new walk.

07:19.012 --> 07:22.181
What do you think? More
arms or less arms?

07:22.215 --> 07:24.984
More arms, for sure.

07:32.759 --> 07:35.155
Lola: Thank you!
Tina: Oh, I get it.

07:35.187 --> 07:38.141
You wanted to take me to the mall
so that I'd see what it's like...

07:38.157 --> 07:40.142
to be on the other side
of the counter,

07:40.189 --> 07:42.793
so that the next time
I'm dealing with a customer,

07:42.817 --> 07:44.879
I'll be nice and friendly...

07:44.933 --> 07:48.222
and remember that in the end,
we're all just people, right?

07:48.262 --> 07:50.410
Lola: No, I just wanted to get
some new lip gloss.

07:50.433 --> 07:53.357
But that would have been
a good idea. You're smart!

07:53.402 --> 07:56.115
Tina: I'm not that smart.
I'm about to lose my job.

07:56.149 --> 07:57.367
- How do you do it?
Lola: What?

07:57.408 --> 08:00.009
Tina: Not get annoyed with people.
Lola: Oh, I don't know.

08:00.048 --> 08:01.415
I guess it's just in my genes.

08:01.476 --> 08:03.044
Oh, no, wait, I'm not wearing jeans.

08:03.173 --> 08:05.292
I should get some jeans!

08:05.326 --> 08:07.998
Tina: Whoa! Hey, what are you doing?

08:08.099 --> 08:10.591
You don't just spray perfume
on someone without askin'.

08:10.623 --> 08:12.716
- No one likes that.
Lola: Ooh, Tina!

08:12.778 --> 08:15.869
This lady just sprayed perfume on
me and I didn't even have to ask.

08:15.903 --> 08:18.304
Hi, can you maybe just
spray a little here?

08:18.338 --> 08:20.873
Yeah, and here.
And then just this whole--

08:20.907 --> 08:22.575
this whole area right here.

08:22.609 --> 08:24.510
Maybe my face? Ow.

08:24.544 --> 08:26.011
Oh, I should have shut my eyes.

08:26.045 --> 08:28.948
It's my fault, my fault.

08:34.520 --> 08:37.138
Bugs: Why did I have to drink so much?!

08:37.193 --> 08:39.125
Ow, ooh, ha, whoo!

08:46.510 --> 08:48.768
Bugs: No, wait!

08:50.471 --> 08:54.440
Bugs: I'm here!

08:54.475 --> 08:56.050
I'm here!

08:56.089 --> 08:57.451
I'm here!

08:57.488 --> 08:59.479
I was here!

08:59.513 --> 09:02.783
Cecil:  It never gets old.

09:02.817 --> 09:06.721
Bugs: "Sorry we missed you."

09:06.755 --> 09:10.491
Oh-ho. You're gonna be sorry.

09:14.930 --> 09:16.597
Daffy: Your family is gorgeous, Ted.

09:16.644 --> 09:18.761
Your son looks like
quarterback material.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.776
- That's my daughter.
Daffy: She's lovely.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.815
And you know a lot of girls
play football these days.

09:22.838 --> 09:26.172
This is quite a résumé.
A little hard to read.

09:26.206 --> 09:29.308
Daffy: That's the Triberica grand.

09:29.343 --> 09:31.477
Hairdresser, marine corp.

09:31.511 --> 09:33.350
You were the CEO of Enormicorp?

09:34.314 --> 09:36.215
This is all incredibly impressive.

09:36.249 --> 09:38.283
Daffy: That's why it's all in bold.

09:38.318 --> 09:40.719
But I'm afraid you're overqualified.

09:40.753 --> 09:43.460
Daffy: What?! No! I swear, I'm not.

09:43.499 --> 09:46.304
It only looks that way
because of the giant font size.

09:46.343 --> 09:49.431
Please, I was born to work
in customer service!

09:49.470 --> 09:53.289
Well, I suppose I can make you
the customer service supervisor.

09:53.656 --> 09:56.294
Daffy: Will I still get to make
people's lives miserable?

09:56.352 --> 09:59.320
Heh! Only when you're forced
to fire someone.

09:59.372 --> 10:01.940
Welcome aboard.

10:03.576 --> 10:05.657
I get to fire people?

10:05.696 --> 10:08.376
Bugs: 5 seconds, you can't go
to the bathroom for 5 seconds?

10:08.415 --> 10:10.516
Daffy: <i>Thank you for
calling Trans Visitron.</i>

10:10.555 --> 10:13.571
We're always working for you.
My name is Daffy.

10:13.610 --> 10:15.883
How can I offer you
excellent service today?

10:15.938 --> 10:18.492
Bugs: Daffy?!
Daffy: Am I speaking to...

10:18.547 --> 10:21.039
- Buges Buney?
Bugs: It's me!

10:21.086 --> 10:24.364
Daffy: Ok, Mr. Buney, what seems
to be the problem today?

10:24.398 --> 10:27.334
Daffy: You know what the problem is,
you live with me.

10:27.368 --> 10:28.968
Our cable's out.

10:29.003 --> 10:31.204
Daffy: Is this Bugs Bunny?

10:31.238 --> 10:32.205
Bugs: Yes!

10:32.240 --> 10:34.908
Daffy: <i>Then why did you say
your name was Buges Buney?</i>

10:34.942 --> 10:36.461
Bugs: I didn't. You did.

10:36.492 --> 10:38.274
Can you just put our cable back on?

10:38.313 --> 10:39.979
Daffy: Oh, I don't know how to do that.

10:40.014 --> 10:41.610
Bugs: I thought you worked there!

10:41.649 --> 10:44.117
Daffy: I do, but so far
I've just been firing people.

10:44.164 --> 10:47.149
Bugs: Daffy, can you please find someone
who can put our cable back on?

10:47.180 --> 10:48.882
I'm about to miss another game!

10:48.936 --> 10:51.116
Daffy: All right, here's what
I'm going to do for you.

10:51.155 --> 10:55.026
I'm going to transfer you to one of
my customer service representatives.

10:55.073 --> 10:57.582
Bugs: No, wait!
Don't put me back on with--

10:57.621 --> 11:00.300
Cecil: Hello, this is Cecil.

11:00.330 --> 11:02.720
Bugs: Please, I'm begging you,
the game is about to start.

11:02.759 --> 11:05.751
Isn't there anything you can do
to turn my cable back on?

11:05.822 --> 11:09.242
Cecil: Hmm. I could try
resetting your account.

11:09.258 --> 11:10.570
Bugs: Yes! Reset it!

11:10.609 --> 11:13.545
Cecil: Okey doke.
How's your day going so far?

11:13.592 --> 11:16.264
Bugs: Horrible!
Cecil: I'm sorry to hear that.

11:16.307 --> 11:19.024
Bugs: Just reset it!
Cecil: All right, here we go!

11:19.063 --> 11:21.233
Bugs: You did it!
My cable's back on!

11:21.280 --> 11:23.870
Cecil: <i>Is there anything else
I can help you with today?</i>

11:26.717 --> 11:28.963
Bugs: But wait, I only have one channel!

11:29.018 --> 11:31.166
Cecil: Yep. That's the bronze package.

11:31.200 --> 11:33.340
Bugs: How is one channel a package?

11:33.371 --> 11:36.003
Cecil: If you want, I can upgrade
you to the silver package.

11:36.050 --> 11:38.939
Bugs: What package do I need
to watch the basketball game?

11:38.996 --> 11:41.275
Cecil: Well, that would be the gold package.

11:41.317 --> 11:43.537
Bugs: Then give me the gold package!

11:43.607 --> 11:46.113
Cecil: Okey doke, please hold.

11:46.147 --> 11:48.715
Ooh, that's hot.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.250
Ohh.

11:50.285 --> 11:52.719
That is ♪ good ♪ coffee.

12:00.872 --> 12:03.897
Speedy: I can't believe you
watch this stuff. It's garbage!

12:03.931 --> 12:07.598
Watch the basketball game or something.
Isn't it the playoffs?

12:11.206 --> 12:13.641
Speedy: Maybe I'll just
watch a little bit.

12:34.130 --> 12:37.598
Cecil: Well, I have
good news and bad news.

12:37.645 --> 12:43.339
The bad news is, I was not able to
upgrade you to the gold package.

12:43.373 --> 12:45.326
Bugs: What's the good news?

12:45.373 --> 12:49.912
Cecil:  Oh, did I
say there was good news?

12:57.887 --> 13:01.223
Will someone tip me over, please?

13:01.258 --> 13:02.691
Julie?

13:02.726 --> 13:05.527
Julie, I know you can hear me.

13:05.562 --> 13:08.431
Julie. Julie.

13:08.465 --> 13:10.066
Julie!

13:10.100 --> 13:12.235
<i>Julie? </i>

13:12.269 --> 13:15.462
Bugs: Of course you realize...

13:15.582 --> 13:17.766
This means war!

13:25.187 --> 13:28.856
Lola: Closed? Why would Pizzarriba
be closed in the middle of the day?

13:45.060 --> 13:46.825
Speedy: Dr. Jimenez has a twin brother?

13:46.864 --> 13:49.644
What would Lindsay say? She's
about to sell the hacienda!

13:49.712 --> 13:51.746
She already has too much on her plate.

13:51.780 --> 13:53.840
Tina: You want to go to Tutty's?
Lola: Ehh.

13:57.754 --> 14:00.715
Daffy: I'm sorry, Julie.
You know how these things go.

14:00.749 --> 14:02.883
I'm gonna need you to
clear out your desk.

14:02.918 --> 14:06.787
And anything you might have left
in the office refrigerator.

14:06.821 --> 14:08.321
Good luck.

14:08.355 --> 14:11.190
Cecil, where are you going?

14:11.225 --> 14:12.525
Cecil: I'm on break.

14:12.559 --> 14:16.121
Daffy: Ok, but you better be back
by 2:30, or you're fired.

14:16.160 --> 14:19.264
Cecil: What?!

14:21.727 --> 14:23.961
Lola: Thanks.

14:24.433 --> 14:27.734
Tina: Wait, I thought you
got the cheeseburger.

14:27.770 --> 14:29.403
Lola: Eh, cottage cheese will be fine.

14:29.461 --> 14:32.028
Try something new.
Who knows, maybe I'll like it.

14:32.376 --> 14:33.642
Mm-hmm.

14:33.677 --> 14:36.152
Hmm, not as cheesy as you'd think.

14:36.215 --> 14:39.450
Very cottage-y, though.

14:39.857 --> 14:41.997
Tina: Ok. Let me give you
a scenario.

14:42.060 --> 14:43.857
Lola: Aw, that's so sweet, thank you.

14:43.885 --> 14:46.453
I feel bad, though. I don't
have anything to give you.

14:46.488 --> 14:48.659
Here, take my cottage cheese,
I insist.

14:48.678 --> 14:50.613
Oh, one more quick, huge bite.

14:50.629 --> 14:55.533
Tina: No, a scenario. I'm going
to describe a situation at work.

14:55.621 --> 14:57.511
You tell me how you would handle it.

14:57.540 --> 14:58.628
Lola: Ooh, fun!

14:58.649 --> 15:02.414
Tina: Ok. Imagine some customer
comes up to you at the counter.

15:02.480 --> 15:04.086
Lola: Who is it?
Tina: Who's what?

15:04.132 --> 15:05.354
Lola: The customer.
Tina: I don't know.

15:05.397 --> 15:07.841
It doesn't matter.
Just pick someone.

15:07.876 --> 15:09.296
Lola: Ok, I've got him.

15:09.335 --> 15:11.212
Tina: All right. So this
customer is in a hurry,

15:11.246 --> 15:13.714
but you're already busy
doing a bunch of other stuff.

15:13.748 --> 15:15.591
Lola: I'm sorry, where do I work again?

15:15.625 --> 15:16.935
Tina: Copy place!

15:16.996 --> 15:18.458
Lola: Right, got it.

15:18.527 --> 15:20.689
Tina: So you tell him to wait a minute,

15:20.723 --> 15:22.157
but he keeps ringing the bell,

15:22.192 --> 15:24.360
saying, "Miss, miss"!

15:24.394 --> 15:27.764
Miss, miss!

15:33.471 --> 15:37.107
Lola: Well, hello there, customer.
Can I help you?

15:37.162 --> 15:38.508
Bugs: That depends.

15:38.542 --> 15:40.810
What are you doing
for the rest of your life?

15:40.845 --> 15:42.414
Lola: Well, kinda thought
I was going to work here

15:42.445 --> 15:44.514
until I figured out
what I really wanted to do.

15:44.581 --> 15:46.031
Or maybe I'll go back to college.

15:46.062 --> 15:47.866
Bugs: Forget all that. Marry me.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.718
Lola:  Customer!

15:49.757 --> 15:52.140
Bugs: Say yes.
Lola: Yes, yes!

15:52.194 --> 15:55.559
I'll be Mrs. customer!

16:02.753 --> 16:04.120
Tina: Lola!

16:04.157 --> 16:06.379
Lola: Huh?
Tina: What would you do with that customer?

16:06.405 --> 16:08.640
Lola: I'd drop everything
and do whatever he said.

16:08.712 --> 16:11.712
He's my customer.
And my customer is my world.

16:11.757 --> 16:12.938
Tina: Wow.

16:12.985 --> 16:17.834
I...Think I've got the wrong
personality for customer service.

16:17.884 --> 16:22.220
Lola: You know, maybe just
one more teeny huge bite.

16:30.185 --> 16:32.696
Bugs:  Welcome to
the coffee hut. My name is Becky.

16:32.733 --> 16:35.484
How can I offer you
excellent service today?

16:35.549 --> 16:37.007
Cecil: I'll have a cappuccino.

16:37.067 --> 16:39.802
Bugs: Okey doke.
Cecil: I'm kind of in a hurry.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.418
Bugs: Oh, looks like
the machine's not working.

16:43.463 --> 16:46.322
If you'd like, I can upgrade
you to a regular coffee.

16:46.359 --> 16:48.741
Cecil: I don't know how that's an upgrade,

16:48.780 --> 16:51.312
- but...ok.
Bugs: Okey doke.

16:53.971 --> 16:57.173
Oh, are you watching the playoffs?

16:57.216 --> 16:58.525
Cecil: No.

16:58.606 --> 17:00.481
I really am in a hurry.

17:00.549 --> 17:02.951
Bugs: Okey doke.
Oh, you know what?

17:03.025 --> 17:04.425
We're out of coffee.

17:04.453 --> 17:06.753
Cecil: Ugh, forget it.

17:07.069 --> 17:09.282
Bugs: If you like,
you can come back tomorrow,

17:09.301 --> 17:13.071
some time between
8:00 A.M. and 6:00 P.M.

17:19.531 --> 17:20.964
Cecil: Whoo! 2:28.

17:22.015 --> 17:25.251
Bugs: Going up?

17:27.721 --> 17:30.023
What package would you like?

17:30.057 --> 17:33.533
Cecil: Package? I just want
to go to the 22nd floor.

17:33.557 --> 17:37.097
Bugs: Well, there's a number of ways
to get to the 22nd floor.

17:37.132 --> 17:39.266
Ah, you can get the silver package,

17:39.301 --> 17:41.155
which takes you to the 20th floor,

17:41.198 --> 17:43.399
but you'll have to walk
the last two floors.

17:43.503 --> 17:45.805
Or I can give you the gold package,

17:45.909 --> 17:47.981
which takes you straight to 22.

17:48.043 --> 17:51.449
But that's not available till
September of next year, see.

17:51.490 --> 17:53.488
Or now in the bronze package,

17:53.545 --> 17:56.670
for every floor we go up,
we go down, too.

17:56.714 --> 17:59.155
So that one
takes a while, mm-hmm.

17:59.260 --> 18:00.737
Cecil: Forget it, I'll take the stairs.

18:00.788 --> 18:02.122
Bugs: Okey doke. Heh.

18:07.043 --> 18:12.247
Bugs: Did I provide you
with excellent service today?

18:13.361 --> 18:17.164
I'm sorry, sir, we can't
photo copy money.

18:17.191 --> 18:18.642
Sam: Of course you can!

18:18.697 --> 18:23.181
You just put the dollar in the
machine and make a million copies!

18:23.442 --> 18:25.242
Oh, thank goodness you're here.

18:25.753 --> 18:28.388
I need you to take care
of this customer.

18:28.423 --> 18:30.357
Tina: That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

18:30.391 --> 18:33.359
I don't think I can do that
and be positive and upbeat.

18:33.463 --> 18:34.750
Forget positive and upbeat.

18:34.789 --> 18:37.624
Right now I need rude
and mean-spirited.

18:37.932 --> 18:39.767
You were right.

18:39.801 --> 18:44.871
I had no idea how hard it was
dealing with these people!

18:48.610 --> 18:51.111
Sam: What are you lookin' at, girly?

18:51.146 --> 18:53.641
Tina: I'll tell you what I'm lookin' at.

18:53.703 --> 18:57.179
A sad little man who buys his jeans
in the children's department

18:57.203 --> 19:00.906
and who's about to get beat up
with his own boots.

19:01.057 --> 19:04.159
You hear me? And if you ever steal
my friend's parking space again,

19:04.194 --> 19:08.430
I'll put you in a shoe box
and bury you in my backyard.

19:08.465 --> 19:10.666
Welcome back.

19:18.908 --> 19:22.544
Cecil: Whoo! I made it.

19:22.645 --> 19:25.080
Where is everyone?
Where am I?

19:25.114 --> 19:29.551
Bugs:  The future.
Cecil: What?!

19:32.288 --> 19:35.857
Where are all the customer
service representatives?

19:35.892 --> 19:37.673
Bugs: In the future, there are none.

19:37.743 --> 19:39.032
Cecil: But why?

19:39.071 --> 19:42.298
Bugs: Because one customer
was so mistreated...

19:42.332 --> 19:46.134
that he rose up
and the people followed!

19:46.169 --> 19:48.570
Cecil:  Mr. Buney!

19:48.604 --> 19:50.971
Bugs:
It's pronounced Bunny!

19:51.026 --> 19:53.002
But you can stop him.

19:53.055 --> 19:53.971
Cecil: How?

19:54.022 --> 19:57.208
Bugs: By turning his cable back on.

19:57.270 --> 19:59.372
Cecil: Ooh!
Bugs: Do it now,

19:59.424 --> 20:02.526
so he doesn't rise up!

20:02.943 --> 20:05.719
Cecil: Wait...Don't you need
to take me back in time

20:05.753 --> 20:07.396
in order for this to work?

20:07.484 --> 20:09.352
Bugs: Yes! Normally.

20:09.451 --> 20:13.529
But, uh, for a bunch of time travel
reasons that you wouldn't understand,

20:13.577 --> 20:15.208
eh, we're going to do it this way.

20:15.240 --> 20:16.984
Cecil: But...
Bugs: Just hurry!

20:17.013 --> 20:19.099
The time hole is closing!

20:19.134 --> 20:21.871
Cecil: Oh, no, the time hole!
There, it's on.

20:21.910 --> 20:24.345
Bugs: Is that all the movie channels?

20:24.387 --> 20:25.163
Cecil: Fine.

20:25.210 --> 20:28.446
Bugs: I know he had the full sports package.

20:28.910 --> 20:33.314
While you're at it, why don't you throw
in the Spanish language channels?

20:33.348 --> 20:37.585
I think he's got a friend
who watches them sometimes.

20:37.619 --> 20:41.822
Cecil: I did it. Now bring me
back to the present.

20:41.857 --> 20:44.420
Daffy: Oh, good, Cecil, it's you.
You're fired.

20:44.421 --> 20:47.094
Cecil: What?!
Daffy: Go ahead and clear out your desk.

20:47.363 --> 20:49.330
Well, that's everyone.

20:49.383 --> 20:51.551
Oh, hey, Bugs.

20:51.812 --> 20:54.126
- Bugs: I think you mean...
- Buges.

20:54.199 --> 20:56.720
Cecil:  Buges Buney?

20:57.273 --> 20:58.413
Bugs: Oh, hey.

20:58.467 --> 21:02.957
Thanks for providing me
with excellent service today.

21:07.216 --> 21:09.750
Daffy: Unbelievable!
Bugs: What?

21:09.785 --> 21:12.925
Daffy: Ted fired me
because I fired everybody else.

21:12.960 --> 21:15.562
Apparently you have to have
a reason to fire people.

21:15.584 --> 21:18.903
See, that's why I don't like
working for big corporations.

21:18.983 --> 21:21.799
Bugs: Well, at least the cable's on
in time for game seven.

21:21.833 --> 21:23.379
Hey, Speedy,
would you mind changing--

21:23.412 --> 21:25.832
Speedy: You're just in time! Lindsay's
about to have her baby.

21:25.886 --> 21:26.836
Daffy: Who's Lindsay?

21:26.866 --> 21:28.965
Speedy: Lindsay is the American
foreign exchange student...

21:29.005 --> 21:30.985
living in the hacienda
with Dr. Jimenez,

21:31.026 --> 21:34.889
but she doesn't know that the hacienda was
built on an ancient Aztecan burial ground.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.798
Daffy: So Dr. Jimenez
is the bad guy?

21:46.918 --> 21:48.656
Speedy: No, Felix is the bad guy.

21:48.776 --> 21:50.749
Dr. Jimenez is wonderful.

21:50.869 --> 21:53.127
He's the father!

21:53.161 --> 21:56.326
Bugs: Eh, I'll watch the finals next year.

Whoa! Whoa!

22:33.762 --> 22:35.989
