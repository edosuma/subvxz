WEBVTT

00:01.760 --> 00:04.354
l just wanna be clear
that l am here as a last resort.

00:04.520 --> 00:05.839
l understand.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.912
l don't have a lot of faith in psychiatry
as a science.

00:09.920 --> 00:12.832
l think some of the drugs you're pushing
are interesting.

00:14.160 --> 00:17.994
And l'm all for messing around
with brain chemistry.

00:18.440 --> 00:21.000
l mean, that's how
l got through high school.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.232
But in my experience, popping pills
doesn't relieve social anxiety. . .

00:26.400 --> 00:30.154
. . .quite as well as, say,
bourbon and Marvin Gaye.

00:30.800 --> 00:34.190
No, l get it. You're desperate,
and l'm full of hooey.

00:36.040 --> 00:40.238
So in the words of Marvin Gaye,
what's going on?

00:41.080 --> 00:45.392
-Everything l say is confidential, right?
-Whatever you say stays in this room.

00:45.560 --> 00:46.788
Kind of like Vegas.

00:46.960 --> 00:49.235
Well, except there's no way
you're leaving here. . .

00:49.400 --> 00:52.312
. . .with more money
than when you came in.

00:53.080 --> 00:55.275
Yeah, like Vegas.

00:57.120 --> 01:01.033
Anyway, last night l'm out
with my stupid, lame-ass brother.

01:01.200 --> 01:04.351
Sounds like
you've got some anger towards him.

01:04.519 --> 01:06.715
Oh, you're good.

01:08.920 --> 01:12.310
This is nice.
You and me, spending time together.

01:12.480 --> 01:15.153
-Why don't we do this more often?
-l don't have an answer.

01:15.320 --> 01:18.756
Well, me neither.
So how long till the movie starts?

01:18.920 --> 01:20.273
About 20 minutes.

01:20.440 --> 01:23.716
Yeah, sure, 20 minutes
not counting previews and ads. . .

01:23.880 --> 01:26.553
. . .the popcorn and the giant pretzel
holding hands. . .

01:26.720 --> 01:30.395
. . .the big soda drinking the little soda,
which, frankly, is cannibalism. . .

01:30.560 --> 01:33.358
. . .and the reminder
to turn off your cell phones and shut up.

01:33.520 --> 01:36.717
But nobody does, because good manners
are just the latest casualty. . .

01:36.880 --> 01:39.474
. . .in the ongoing collapse
of Western civilization.

01:39.640 --> 01:41.995
l now have an answer.

01:44.480 --> 01:47.199
-l miss Jake.
-How can you miss him?

01:47.360 --> 01:49.669
We just dropped him off
at his friend's house.

01:49.840 --> 01:52.832
By the way, if you get tired
of those magazines under your bed. . .

01:53.000 --> 01:55.468
. . .the kid's mom looked fairly doable.

01:55.640 --> 01:59.235
Forget the mom. Did you see how happy
Jake was spending the weekend away?

01:59.400 --> 02:00.549
Why would you think that?

02:00.720 --> 02:03.393
Just because he jumped out of the car
while it was moving?

02:03.560 --> 02:08.076
Alan, he was happy to see his friends.
Being away from you is just gravy.

02:08.240 --> 02:11.550
l know, l know. lt's natural
for him to want to spend more time. . .

02:11.720 --> 02:13.551
. . .with his peers than his parents.

02:13.720 --> 02:16.871
But all the same, it's sad.

02:17.040 --> 02:19.918
Yeah, sunrise, sunset.

02:21.480 --> 02:23.550
One day you're holding a baby
in your arms. . .

02:23.720 --> 02:26.757
. . .and the next day he's off
hawking loogies and lighting farts. . .

02:26.920 --> 02:29.832
. . .with a bunch of
Ritalin-addled sixth graders.

02:30.240 --> 02:32.310
Why do l bother
to share my feelings with you?

02:32.480 --> 02:34.789
l don't know.
lt's not like l encourage it.

02:35.720 --> 02:38.837
Oh, come on, so your kid
doesn't need you like he used to.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.353
That's a good thing.

02:40.520 --> 02:43.239
You can spend your weekends
enjoying yourself.

02:43.680 --> 02:47.355
That's true. l mean, there are things
l wanna do that l haven't had time for.

02:47.520 --> 02:49.351
Like that kid's mom.

02:49.520 --> 02:52.193
No, no, l mean like-- Like reading.

02:52.360 --> 02:54.112
Finally cracking open the classics.

02:54.280 --> 02:57.670
Alan, if you wanna crack something
open, l recommend that kid's mom.

02:58.440 --> 02:59.634
No, no, l'm serious.

02:59.800 --> 03:02.553
You know, for years
l have been wishing that l had time. . .

03:02.720 --> 03:04.438
. . .to read all the great books.

03:04.600 --> 03:09.390
You know, Dostoyevsky
and Hemingway. . .

03:09.560 --> 03:13.155
. . .Faulkner and Dickens
and Shakespeare.

03:13.320 --> 03:14.355
And history, history.

03:14.520 --> 03:18.559
U.S.-- U.S. history, world history,
the history of language.

03:18.720 --> 03:21.757
l mean, why doesn't anyone
speak Sumerian anymore?

03:23.160 --> 03:25.833
l don't know,
because l haven't read the book.

03:26.880 --> 03:32.352
And, oh, poetry, poetry.
Byron and Keats and Shelley.

03:32.520 --> 03:34.078
And biographies.

03:34.240 --> 03:37.789
Julius Caesar and Abraham Lincoln
and, oh, Groucho Marx.

03:37.960 --> 03:42.272
l mean-- l mean, look at them all.
Look at them, they're mocking me.

03:42.440 --> 03:43.873
l haven't read any of them.

03:44.040 --> 03:46.759
Okay, well, just pick one for now.

03:46.920 --> 03:48.751
Why bother? There's not enough time.

03:48.920 --> 03:51.434
There's too many books,
and there's not enough time.

03:51.600 --> 03:54.353
Maybe you just need a system.
Put a book next to the toilet.

03:54.520 --> 03:56.795
Every couple of days,
knock out a couple chapters.

03:56.960 --> 03:59.190
No, no, it's too late for me.

03:59.360 --> 04:02.477
There's not enough
bowel movements left.

04:05.560 --> 04:08.597
-Maybe you need to change your diet.
-No, it's hopeless.

04:08.760 --> 04:10.955
Jake will be grown up soon
and l'll be dead.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.917
And you know
what l'll have left behind?

04:13.080 --> 04:16.629
A life of unfulfilled dreams,
a shelf of unread books. . .

04:16.800 --> 04:20.394
. . .and three unopened seasons
of Six Feet Under on DVD.

04:23.280 --> 04:25.669
So, what are you doing tonight?

04:32.360 --> 04:33.349
All right.

04:33.520 --> 04:36.876
So your brother had a panic attack
in the middle of a bookstore.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.157
How'd that make you feel?

04:39.840 --> 04:42.877
What the hell do my feelings
have to do with anything?

04:43.040 --> 04:45.429
Why don't you just humor me?

04:46.240 --> 04:48.117
Well, l felt a little ashamed.

04:48.280 --> 04:50.794
Because you felt
that his behavior reflected on you?

04:50.960 --> 04:53.315
No, because l left him there.

04:54.360 --> 04:55.679
You left him?

04:56.640 --> 04:59.712
Not permanently.
l came back and got him. . .

04:59.880 --> 05:02.633
. . .after he was all cried out
and it was time for the movie.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.313
So you still went to the movie?

05:04.480 --> 05:07.517
Yeah, l bought the tickets online.
They don't refund those.

05:14.440 --> 05:16.158
Red Vine?

05:17.080 --> 05:20.914
No, thank you. l am so sorry.
l don't know what came over me.

05:21.080 --> 05:24.356
Who among us hasn't collapsed,
weeping, in the middle of a bookstore. . .

05:24.520 --> 05:26.317
. . .for no apparent reason?

05:26.800 --> 05:29.109
You know, l think
maybe l'd be better off at home.

05:29.680 --> 05:31.511
So l'm supposed to miss the movie. . .

05:31.680 --> 05:34.114
. . .just because
you had a nervous breakdown?

05:34.280 --> 05:35.838
Well, kind of.

05:36.280 --> 05:38.669
Don't you think
that's a little selfish, Alan?

05:39.720 --> 05:44.589
lt's just, all of a sudden l felt crushed
by this unbelievable sense of grief. . .

05:44.760 --> 05:48.594
. . .like my entire life has been an exercise
in pathetic futility.

05:48.760 --> 05:50.910
Well, l wouldn't rule it out.

05:52.240 --> 05:54.276
Come on, bunky, cheer up.
Have a Red Vine.

05:54.440 --> 05:55.998
l don't want a Red Vine.

05:56.160 --> 05:57.639
-Sno-Cap?
-No.

05:57.800 --> 05:59.279
-Raisinet?
-No.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.112
-Goobers?
-How much crap did you buy?

06:01.280 --> 06:02.793
They couldn't change a hundred.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.435
All right, l'll have a Junior Mint.

06:09.320 --> 06:10.753
l didn't get Junior Mints.

06:12.600 --> 06:15.398
Of course not. Story of my life.

06:15.560 --> 06:18.950
No Junior Mints for Alan.
Just Goobers.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.872
Goobers, Goobers, Goobers.

06:21.040 --> 06:23.952
-Dude, dude, you need to be quiet.
-Why? Why?

06:24.120 --> 06:27.271
The First Amendment gives me
the right to yell in a crowded theater.

06:27.440 --> 06:29.396
Goobers!

06:30.440 --> 06:31.873
Hey, look, movie quiz.

06:32.040 --> 06:34.918
-Let's play the movie quiz.
-l don't wanna play the movie quiz.

06:35.080 --> 06:37.548
-lt'll be fun. l'll bet you're good at it.
-All right.

06:37.720 --> 06:40.871
''Debra Winger and Richard Gere
starred in An Officer and a blank. ''

06:41.040 --> 06:44.749
-Oh, please.
-You need a hint?

06:45.200 --> 06:47.998
-There's a hint in the corner.
-No, l don't need a hint.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.879
l know the answer.
Everybody here knows the answer.

06:51.040 --> 06:52.917
Everybody on the planet
knows the answer.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.640
-We're not stupid.
-Chill, chill.

06:55.800 --> 06:57.677
Oh, wait.
Oh, here's another brainteaser.

06:57.840 --> 07:00.195
''Steven Spielberg
directed this modern retelling. . .

07:00.360 --> 07:03.830
. . .of the H.G. Wells classic
War of the blank. ''

07:04.000 --> 07:07.037
-Couch. War of the Couch.
-Stop it.

07:07.200 --> 07:09.998
Oh, wait, no, no, l got it.
War of the Blow-It-Out-Your-Ass.

07:10.160 --> 07:12.833
You know what? Maybe you're right.
Maybe we should go.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.399
Oh, wait, no, l know this one.

07:14.560 --> 07:17.358
''Johnny Depp cruised to success
in this comedy-action film. . .

07:17.520 --> 07:19.397
. . .inspired by a Disneyland attraction. ''

07:19.560 --> 07:21.915
Pirates of the Blow-It-Out-Your-Ass.

07:22.080 --> 07:23.672
He's-- He's behind on his reading.

07:23.840 --> 07:27.276
Oh, and let's not forget Judy Garland
in that immortal classic. . .

07:27.440 --> 07:30.989
... The Wizard of Blow-It-Out-Your-Ass.

07:31.160 --> 07:34.948
That sounds like quite an episode.
ls your brother seeing a therapist?

07:35.120 --> 07:36.951
How would l know?

07:37.120 --> 07:39.839
He's your brother. He lives with you.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.592
So?

07:42.640 --> 07:44.835
All right, go ahead.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.912
Just because l took him in,
doesn't mean l listen to him.

07:48.080 --> 07:49.149
l understand.

07:49.320 --> 07:52.392
He just whines about the same crap
over and over.

07:52.560 --> 07:55.279
-Okay.
-lt's not even interesting crap.

07:56.960 --> 07:59.679
lt's the crap
that bores the crap out of crap.

07:59.840 --> 08:02.229
l got it. lt's crap. Go ahead.

08:02.400 --> 08:06.916
Thank you.
So we're driving home, and. . . .

08:14.520 --> 08:16.590
This seat is very comfortable.

08:16.760 --> 08:20.514
Genuine leather, nine-way adjustable,
lumbar support. lt's. . . .

08:20.680 --> 08:24.150
l wish l'd have spent a few extra bucks
and gotten the ejection package.

08:25.080 --> 08:28.868
-l said l was sorry.
-They don't refund those tickets, Alan.

08:31.400 --> 08:34.551
-l wanna go see Jake.
-Why? He's at a sleepover.

08:34.720 --> 08:37.518
l've just got this feeling
that he needs me.

08:37.679 --> 08:39.671
You mean
like some sort of telepathic thing?

08:39.840 --> 08:42.195
-Exactly.
-l see.

08:44.360 --> 08:46.396
-Did you know l was gonna do that?
-No.

08:46.560 --> 08:49.472
Then l wouldn't trust
your psychic powers.

08:50.080 --> 08:52.833
Oh, come on.
We can just stop by for a few minutes.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.992
We have time now,
since we decided to skip the movie.

08:56.160 --> 09:00.278
Oh, we decided that, did we? That's
the way it went down for you, huh?

09:00.440 --> 09:02.396
That's how
you interpret recent events?

09:03.200 --> 09:05.668
Settle down.
You're acting like a crazy person.

09:05.840 --> 09:10.356
Me? l'm acting like a crazy person?
Are you freaking kidding me?

09:10.520 --> 09:14.069
Listen to yourself.
You're getting a little scary right now.

09:16.320 --> 09:18.880
Okay, fine. You wanna see the kid,
we'll go see the kid.

09:19.040 --> 09:20.553
Thank you.

09:21.320 --> 09:22.799
Was that so hard?

09:28.840 --> 09:31.832
Charlie? The road.

09:35.960 --> 09:37.678
Please?

09:41.640 --> 09:43.073
You know, when you have kids. . .

09:43.240 --> 09:45.470
. . .you find there's a deep,
spiritual connection.

09:45.640 --> 09:48.632
You feel an actual tug
when your child needs you.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.997
lnteresting. What do you feel
when your brother hates you?

09:54.000 --> 09:55.797
Alan. ls everything okay?

09:55.960 --> 09:58.349
Oh, yeah, fine.
l just need to see Jake for a minute.

09:58.520 --> 10:00.715
-He's feeling a tug.
-A tug?

10:00.880 --> 10:03.713
Or it could be gas. We're not sure.

10:04.720 --> 10:06.153
Well, could you just call Jake?

10:06.320 --> 10:10.950
Jake, your father's here!
Put that down, Timmy!

10:11.120 --> 10:13.998
-What?
-l just wanted to see if you were okay.

10:15.480 --> 10:17.914
Oh, great, now l'm dead.
Thanks a lot.

10:18.680 --> 10:21.717
lt doesn't count.
l was talking to my stupid dad.

10:23.360 --> 10:26.557
Well, it-- lt seems like
you've got everything under control here.

10:26.720 --> 10:28.392
Actually, l ran out of ice cream.

10:28.560 --> 10:31.552
Do you think you could keep an eye
on the kids for a few minutes?

10:31.720 --> 10:34.234
-Well--
-Thanks a million. l'll be right back.

10:36.000 --> 10:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here

10:44.880 --> 10:47.075
She ain't coming back.

10:47.480 --> 10:50.278
Three hours she was gone.

10:51.640 --> 10:56.077
And when she finally came back,
she was reeking of Old Spice and pot.

10:56.240 --> 10:59.550
-l see.
-And she didn't even have any ice cream.

11:00.480 --> 11:02.789
All right, let's stop here for a minute. . .

11:02.960 --> 11:06.475
. . .and talk in general
about your feelings towards women.

11:06.640 --> 11:08.631
No, thanks.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.711
-Rather discuss your childhood?
-Nope.

11:10.880 --> 11:13.713
-Father? Mother?
-Dead. Killed him.

11:14.560 --> 11:17.074
-Would you like to discuss that?
-We just did.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.399
Charlie, l'm not sure
we're on the same page here.

11:20.560 --> 11:22.312
Have you ever been in therapy before?

11:22.880 --> 11:26.714
-Does massage therapy count?
-No.

11:26.880 --> 11:29.838
lt's almost the same thing.
One-on-one with a strange woman. . .

11:30.000 --> 11:33.276
. . .who charges you for the hour
and then only gives you 50 minutes?

11:34.920 --> 11:36.797
Why don't we just go back
to your story?

11:36.960 --> 11:39.315
Touch a nerve there, did l?

11:42.040 --> 11:43.234
Okay, okay.

11:43.400 --> 11:47.393
Well, Jake ignored his father
the entire time we were there, so. . .

11:47.800 --> 11:50.314
...Alan was a little upset
when we got back in the car.

11:50.480 --> 11:53.631
He hates me. My only son hates me.

11:53.840 --> 11:57.276
He doesn't hate you. He just
didn't appreciate you telling his friends. . .

11:57.440 --> 12:00.432
. . .that laser tag
can induce epileptic fits.

12:00.600 --> 12:02.591
-Well, it can.
-Be that as it may. . .

12:02.760 --> 12:06.116
. . .you could've gotten your point across
without flopping on the floor. . .

12:06.280 --> 12:09.158
. . .rolling your eyes up,
and pretending to swallow your tongue.

12:09.320 --> 12:13.029
Hey, hey.
A picture is worth a thous--

12:14.760 --> 12:15.795
Charlie, stop the car.

12:16.240 --> 12:17.355
-Why?
-l have to get out.

12:17.520 --> 12:20.034
-l'm feeling claustrophobic.
-There's no place to stop.

12:20.200 --> 12:23.033
-We have to stop!
-Where?

12:23.200 --> 12:25.589
l can't breathe. l can't breathe.
l have to get out.

12:25.760 --> 12:29.309
-l have to get out now. Now, now, now.
-Okay, okay, hold on. Hold on.

12:32.320 --> 12:33.719
The seat belt won't come off.

12:33.880 --> 12:35.757
-Just push the button.
-l can't, l can't.

12:35.920 --> 12:39.469
-lt won't come off. Help me.
-Okay, okay, move your hands.

12:43.160 --> 12:44.639
Okay.

12:45.160 --> 12:48.709
lt's passing. lt's-- Yes. l'm okay.

12:48.880 --> 12:50.359
-No, you're not.
-What?

12:50.800 --> 12:51.869
-Get out.
-What?

12:52.040 --> 12:55.476
Get out now. Now, now, now.
Get out. Get out.

13:02.320 --> 13:04.356
That's better.

13:10.760 --> 13:13.877
So you just left your brother
on the side of the road?

13:14.640 --> 13:16.915
He couldn't believe it either.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.436
You should've seen his face
in the rear-view mirror.

13:21.600 --> 13:25.275
All right, Charlie, we've been talking
for quite a while, and l gotta tell you:

13:25.440 --> 13:28.034
l still don't understand
why you came to see me.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.349
You in a hurry?

13:30.800 --> 13:34.429
Doesn't that undermine your whole
pay-by-the-hour business model?

13:35.720 --> 13:38.439
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

13:38.600 --> 13:42.309
So as l was driving away,
l decided l needed a little quiet time. . .

13:42.480 --> 13:45.040
. . .for, you know,
reflection and meditation.

13:54.360 --> 13:57.511
-Hey.
-Hey. What took you so long?

13:58.320 --> 14:00.550
l was sure you'd come back.

14:01.880 --> 14:04.474
l guess that's case closed
on the telepathy stuff.

14:06.560 --> 14:10.599
-What are you drinking?
-l don't know, something soothing.

14:11.320 --> 14:13.709
-Kahlua and cream.
-He's kidding. Give him a beer.

14:13.880 --> 14:17.236
-Must you always embarrass me?
-Hey, l have had a traumatic night.

14:17.400 --> 14:19.868
l feel very exposed, vulnerable,
confused--

14:20.040 --> 14:22.315
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, shut up, shut up, shut up.

14:24.240 --> 14:25.559
-Hi.
-Hi.

14:25.720 --> 14:28.757
-Yeah, hi.
-Can we buy you ladies a drink?

14:28.920 --> 14:33.311
-No, thanks. We're already pretty blitzed.
-Boy, are we blitzed.

14:33.480 --> 14:34.549
Perfect.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.319
l'm Charlie. This is Alan.

14:37.480 --> 14:38.993
-Amy.
-Beth.

14:39.160 --> 14:41.469
Nice to meet you.
How's it going tonight?

14:41.640 --> 14:43.710
-Pretty good.
-We're blitzed.

14:45.160 --> 14:48.391
-How about you?
-Yeah, how you doing?

14:48.560 --> 14:51.870
-Oh, boy. Where to start?
-No one's talking to you.

14:52.040 --> 14:54.554
-What's the matter, Alan?
-Yeah, what's the matter?

14:54.720 --> 14:56.438
Well, you really wanna know?

14:56.600 --> 14:59.512
They don't. Trust me, you really don't.

14:59.680 --> 15:02.638
Well, maybe it's a late reaction
to the divorce.

15:02.800 --> 15:07.157
Maybe it's my son not needing me
so much now that he's growing up. . .

15:07.320 --> 15:09.436
. . .but l think it's more than that.

15:09.600 --> 15:12.637
l think it's just life grinding me down,
and l just. . . .

15:13.320 --> 15:15.151
l don't think l can take it anymore.

15:15.640 --> 15:18.791
-Oh, you poor baby.
-Poor, poor baby.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.315
-Tell us all about it.
-Yeah, tell us.

15:21.480 --> 15:24.233
Well, l was never a happy child.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.994
Oh, God, l was a miserable kid.

15:28.520 --> 15:31.353
And the only thing
that gave my life meaning was my son.

15:31.520 --> 15:33.351
At least you've got a son.

15:34.680 --> 15:37.433
l've got nothing, except. . .

15:37.600 --> 15:38.635
. . .epilepsy.

15:40.080 --> 15:41.877
-Oh, no.
-Yeah, oh, no.

15:49.760 --> 15:53.070
So anyway,
there l was on my wedding day. . .

15:53.240 --> 15:55.800
. . .in front of the priest
and all our friends. . .

15:55.960 --> 15:58.633
. . .flopping around on the altar
like an epileptic trout. . .

15:59.600 --> 16:01.352
. . .when l heard her father say:

16:01.520 --> 16:05.115
''You can't marry this man.
He's damaged goods. ''

16:05.280 --> 16:09.319
-Oh, gee.
-Yeah, oh, gee.

16:09.480 --> 16:12.040
That's when l realized
that all the money in the world--

16:12.200 --> 16:14.031
And l do have a lot.

16:14.600 --> 16:18.354
--can't replace that special tug
you feel. . .

16:20.080 --> 16:22.878
. . .when someone loves you
unconditionally.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.914
-Look, Beth, the ocean.
-Oh, the ocean.

16:26.080 --> 16:27.513
-Let's go skinny-dipping.
-Yeah.

16:27.680 --> 16:30.194
-You wanna come?
-Yeah, come with us.

16:30.360 --> 16:34.273
l'd love to, but l'm too sad
and l might swallow my tongue.

16:34.440 --> 16:40.197
You two go. Swim, splash, frolic.
Enjoy your healthy bodies.

16:40.360 --> 16:42.590
-Okay.
-Bye.

16:43.240 --> 16:44.593
Have you no shame?

16:45.200 --> 16:47.760
Let me think. Nope, just a tug.

16:47.920 --> 16:50.070
And that's another thing.
My angst is real.

16:50.240 --> 16:53.118
l don't appreciate you taking my tug
to get in someone's pants.

16:53.280 --> 16:56.750
News flash, Alan.
They're already out of their pants.

16:56.920 --> 17:00.276
And they're gonna come back cold, wet
and in desperate need of body heat.

17:00.440 --> 17:04.433
For those of us with normal skin
temperature, it'll be a seller's market.

17:04.880 --> 17:06.950
-You're unbelievable.
-No, l just think ahead.

17:07.119 --> 17:09.998
They're gonna last two seconds
in that water. We have to hurry.

17:10.160 --> 17:12.070
l'll get the wine.
You light some candles.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.800
l'm sorry, l'm really not in the mood.

17:14.960 --> 17:19.032
Are you saying that l have to
get you liquored up so l can get laid?

17:19.760 --> 17:22.273
All right, l'll go along,
but only as a favor to you.

17:22.440 --> 17:24.031
Thank you.

17:24.839 --> 17:26.558
l'm gonna have to apply the condom. . .

17:26.720 --> 17:29.917
. . .and get a rope and pulley
to lower one of those broads onto him.

17:32.280 --> 17:34.919
Since you're making me do this,
l get Amy.

17:35.080 --> 17:37.878
The hell you do. Which one's Amy?

17:38.760 --> 17:41.069
Amy's the one
who overcame the eating disorder.

17:41.240 --> 17:45.631
-Starving herself or throwing up?
-Does it make a difference?

17:46.160 --> 17:49.152
-Does if you're paying for dinner.
-Amy is the brunette.

17:49.320 --> 17:52.630
-Got it. So l have Jennifer.
-You mean Beth.

17:52.800 --> 17:56.759
-Oh, right, right, B for ''blonde. ''
-B can also be for ''brunette. ''

17:56.920 --> 18:00.595
But Amy's the brunette.
So you could do A for ''anorexic. ''

18:00.760 --> 18:03.149
Unless it's B for ''bulimic. ''

18:03.920 --> 18:06.639
Good point.
We're gonna need a new system.

18:07.240 --> 18:08.878
Do you smell something?

18:09.040 --> 18:11.793
Yeah, what is that?

18:17.480 --> 18:19.994
l think you do these things
just to piss me off.

18:22.960 --> 18:26.157
-Oh, my God, what happened?
-Well, while l was trying to put it out. . .

18:26.320 --> 18:28.834
. . .my brother
stupidly called the fire department.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.035
Why was that stupid?

18:30.200 --> 18:33.237
Have you seen
a Malibu fireman recently?

18:33.760 --> 18:37.719
They're all young, buff surfer dudes
whipping their big hoses around.

18:39.720 --> 18:42.996
Amy and Beth jumped on their
hook and ladder like a couple Dalmatians.

18:43.160 --> 18:45.435
We never saw them again.

18:45.840 --> 18:47.478
Yes, the Malibu Fire Department.

18:47.640 --> 18:51.474
l have several patients who compulsively
masturbate to their calendar.

18:51.640 --> 18:54.154
-No kidding.
-Both sexes.

18:55.240 --> 18:56.832
So, Charlie, l'm still not clear. . .

18:57.000 --> 18:59.389
. . .on what it is
you would like me to help you with.

18:59.560 --> 19:03.314
Your anger issues?
Your sexual issues? Drinking?

19:03.480 --> 19:05.789
No, no, no, that's all cool.

19:05.960 --> 19:09.475
Then tell me, why are you here?

19:09.640 --> 19:13.428
Okay, well, l'm here
to lay some groundwork for the future.

19:13.600 --> 19:14.999
Some groundwork?

19:15.160 --> 19:17.958
Yeah. l've come to realize
that there's a very good chance. . .

19:18.120 --> 19:20.918
. . .that l might someday snap
and kill my brother.

19:23.160 --> 19:26.118
And l figure if l'm
already under a psychiatrist's care. . .

19:26.280 --> 19:28.953
. . .then l can always
cop an insanity plea.

19:29.720 --> 19:32.598
You're thinking of killing your brother?

19:35.960 --> 19:39.111
Doctor-patient confidentiality.

19:45.640 --> 19:46.868
Where's the bottle opener?

19:47.040 --> 19:49.349
Check in the drawer
by the coffee machine.

19:49.520 --> 19:52.080
Hey, what do you think of this
for the new drapes?

19:53.320 --> 19:54.992
Too small.

19:55.600 --> 19:59.912
You know, l think it's kind of cheerful.
l'll put it in the ''maybe'' pile.

20:00.680 --> 20:02.591
You do that.

20:03.360 --> 20:05.954
You know, we're also
gonna have to reupholster the couch.

20:06.120 --> 20:08.190
-You think?
-There's a lot of water damage.

20:08.360 --> 20:12.353
Which, frankly, l think was the result
of the firemen showing off for the girls.

20:12.520 --> 20:14.317
You could be right.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.638
You know, l just wanna tell you. . .

20:17.800 --> 20:21.429
. . .l really appreciate you sticking by me
in the past couple of days. . .

20:21.600 --> 20:23.397
. . .you know,
pulling me out of my funk.

20:23.560 --> 20:25.869
You really are a great brother.

20:26.800 --> 20:30.713
-l don't know what l'd do without you.
-l don't know what l'd do without you.

20:33.680 --> 20:37.912
But golly, it's sure fun to think about.
