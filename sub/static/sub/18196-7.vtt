00:22.960 --> 00:24.757
Oh, hello, there.

00:24.840 --> 00:26.956
Hello.
- How was your flight?

00:27.040 --> 00:29.156
It was tiring.
- Mm.

00:29.240 --> 00:31.196
Jenny says hello.
- Mm-hm.

00:34.640 --> 00:36.915
Holy shite! What is that?
- What?

00:37.000 --> 00:38.797
You're enormous.

00:38.880 --> 00:40.916
I'm having a baby.
- What? Right now?

00:42.720 --> 00:44.631
Nice to see you, too, Adam.

00:44.720 --> 00:46.756
Oh...Rach.

00:46.840 --> 00:48.353
Rachel!

00:52.280 --> 00:55.352
Good to see you. Tell me about New York.

00:55.440 --> 00:57.351
It was fine.

00:57.440 --> 00:59.874
Do you want tea?
- Ooh, I'd love one.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.029
Bloody hell!

01:01.120 --> 01:04.715
I know. Since I've been away,
it's just kind of...

01:05.800 --> 01:07.518
Anyway, what have I missed?

01:07.600 --> 01:09.636
Oh, erm...

01:09.720 --> 01:11.870
Nothing, really. Oh, Suggs and I broke up.

01:11.960 --> 01:13.473
Oh, no. Why?

01:13.560 --> 01:15.516
Do you want to see a movie tonight?

01:15.600 --> 01:19.115
What are we doing, practising for
my next date?

01:19.200 --> 01:22.875
Actually, I thought this could be
your next date.

01:22.960 --> 01:25.997
No real reason. Just kind of fizzled out.

01:27.440 --> 01:29.954
<i>Jo said David had bought you a racehorse.</i>

01:30.040 --> 01:32.838
We went to watch it run at Chester.

01:32.920 --> 01:34.717
Oh, I bet that was brilliant.

01:37.720 --> 01:41.076
Well, it was certainly a day
I won't forget in a hurry.

01:47.240 --> 01:50.550
So come on. You've told me about
everyone else. What about you?

01:55.320 --> 01:57.709
Er...what do you mean?

01:57.800 --> 01:59.836
What did you get up to while I was away?

01:59.920 --> 02:01.319
Erm...

02:02.600 --> 02:05.273
It wasn't you who came back
to my flat the other night?

02:05.360 --> 02:06.315
No.

02:06.400 --> 02:09.789
Took me to bed
and couldn't deliver the goods?

02:09.880 --> 02:11.632
No.

02:12.720 --> 02:13.835
Fine.

02:14.560 --> 02:17.597
I got picked up by this gorgeous woman
who tried to seduce me,

02:17.680 --> 02:19.557
but I couldn't be unfaithful to you.

02:21.200 --> 02:22.952
Yeah, right.

02:29.960 --> 02:32.076
<i>It's just as well, really, cos...</i>

02:37.680 --> 02:40.035
Come in.
- David, not interrupting, am I?

02:40.120 --> 02:43.635
I'm looking for some batteries.
- Never mind that. I've got a job for you.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.993
I am your loyal lieutenant.
Sorry, loo-tenant.

02:49.080 --> 02:52.117
Whatever.
You're a pretty good judge of character.

02:52.200 --> 02:54.589
The new chairman - what do you make of him?

02:54.680 --> 02:57.353
Sir Donald? Well, he's an amiable old cove.

02:57.440 --> 03:00.113
Very clubbable. Not one to rock the boat.

03:00.200 --> 03:03.556
He wants us to cut the wage bil by 20 %.

03:03.640 --> 03:04.834
God.

03:04.920 --> 03:08.117
Mm. He's given me the job of recommending
where the axe should fall.

03:08.200 --> 03:09.553
I don't envy you that one.

03:09.640 --> 03:14.111
Neither do I,
which is why I am giving the job to you.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.872
To me?

03:15.960 --> 03:19.669
It's called delegation, David.
- It's called passing the buck, Natalie.

03:20.960 --> 03:23.155
Helen, tell Charles I want to see him.

03:23.240 --> 03:25.117
You are not passing the buck to him?

03:25.200 --> 03:27.430
No, no. I'm just delegating.

03:27.520 --> 03:29.351
Helen, cancel that.

03:29.440 --> 03:31.829
Look, David, this has got to come
from the top.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.558
And after me, that's you.

03:33.640 --> 03:35.949
Besides, you're perfect. You know the staff.

03:36.040 --> 03:38.918
You get along with them.
- Not when news of this leaks out.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.992
Which is why we need complete
confidentiality.

03:42.080 --> 03:44.958
If you're going to send me memos,
write them yourself.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.356
Karen.

03:55.240 --> 03:57.276
Hey, Mark.

04:01.560 --> 04:03.198
Come on, then.

04:03.280 --> 04:04.918
Where do I sit?

04:05.000 --> 04:07.230
I beg your pardon?

04:07.320 --> 04:09.311
My desk.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.391
I take it I'll have a desk.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.116
I thought you turned the job down.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.998
Well, I reconsidered.
- Oh.

04:18.079 --> 04:20.196
If the offer's still open.

04:21.190 --> 04:26.435
Well, erm...you understand we...
we have been interviewing.

04:26.520 --> 04:29.239
<i>Mark, your wife on line one.</i>

04:29.320 --> 04:31.629
Er...yes, Jill. Tell her I'll call her back.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.717
Right. So, where were we?

04:37.800 --> 04:39.472
Oh, yes...

04:39.560 --> 04:41.198
your desk.

05:03.280 --> 05:06.636
Whoo-ha! Suck on my exhaust, loser.

05:06.720 --> 05:07.994
Hey, you only came fifth.

05:08.080 --> 05:10.355
Yeah, which is one ahead of you.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.510
<i>Starters to the grid. Race Four.</i>

05:12.600 --> 05:14.955
Ah! Enjoy the view from behind.

05:17.600 --> 05:21.354
''Introduce bracket A into runner B.''
Right.

05:21.440 --> 05:25.069
What's that?
- Oh, erm...it's a cot.

05:25.160 --> 05:29.233
It's meant to be, but er...
we might have to make do with a sheep pen.

05:29.320 --> 05:30.719
A cot?

05:30.800 --> 05:33.678
Yeah, yeah.
Look, I thought you'd be longer in the bath.

05:33.760 --> 05:36.513
You know, I erm...I wanted it
to be a surprise.

05:36.600 --> 05:38.556
Well, it is... it is.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.596
Erm...when did you get that?

05:40.680 --> 05:42.910
Yesterday. Don't worry. I did the research.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.479
Smooth-action drop side.

05:44.560 --> 05:48.109
Enough bells and whistles to keep them
amused, but not to keep them awake.

05:48.200 --> 05:50.760
Adam, we've still got a way to go.

05:50.840 --> 05:53.070
It might take me that long to
put it together.

05:53.160 --> 05:57.119
I mean, have you seen these instructions?
They're translated from Swedish.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.952
I've been introducing the pieces.

05:59.040 --> 06:01.474
I don't know if I'm ready to
get into cots yet.

06:01.560 --> 06:06.270
Yeah, but I am. Rach, the last few days -
I'm so excited about the baby.

06:06.360 --> 06:07.952
And look at the state of you.

06:08.040 --> 06:09.871
You look fit to drop.

06:09.960 --> 06:11.916
I just wish you wouldn't do it now.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.718
Given that it is a pain in the hole,

06:13.800 --> 06:16.917
and all I've managed to do
is get these bits out of the box...

06:17.000 --> 06:19.958
Sorry, Adam. I'm sure I've still
got jet lag.

06:20.040 --> 06:23.316
Why don't you ring up Pete
and go to the pub tonight?

06:23.400 --> 06:25.197
What a wife.

06:42.040 --> 06:43.189
Hello?

06:43.280 --> 06:45.236
Nag's Head or Crossed Keys?

06:45.320 --> 06:48.392
You what? - Where you're taking
me for a pint, big lad.

06:48.480 --> 06:51.517
No, I can't. I'm busy.
- Doing what?

06:51.600 --> 06:54.114
Erm...seeing my mum.
- Hey, you want a drink?

06:54.200 --> 06:55.599
Was that Jo?

06:55.680 --> 06:57.477
No. Coke.

06:57.560 --> 06:59.835
<i>All go-karts...
- You're at the Kartin.</i>

07:00.920 --> 07:03.275
Yeah, all right, I am. Yeah.

07:03.360 --> 07:06.875
With your mother?
- Yeah. Well, it's over-60s night.

07:06.960 --> 07:10.635
Race A Granny. Anyway, got to go.
I'll call you tomorrow. Bye.

07:10.720 --> 07:12.676
Wh...?

07:14.400 --> 07:17.358
Right, you bollocks. Here, Rachel.

07:17.440 --> 07:20.034
Just the one, thanks.

07:22.360 --> 07:23.679
Hello?

07:23.760 --> 07:26.797
Hi, it's Adam. Is Pete there?
- Yeah, hang on, he's right here.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.791
Hello?
- Ah-ha!

07:29.880 --> 07:31.632
Didn't think I knew Jo's number, eh?

07:31.720 --> 07:33.870
No.

07:33.960 --> 07:35.712
No, no.

07:35.800 --> 07:39.076
Well, Rachel did. So, Jo is there.
I bet your mother isn't.

07:39.160 --> 07:40.957
She's probably at Mass.
- Adam!

07:41.040 --> 07:43.554
Put my name down. I'll be there in 20.

07:43.640 --> 07:45.596
No, no, no, no. Adam, no, no.

07:45.680 --> 07:47.591
Wait. You can't come.

07:47.680 --> 07:50.478
Look, I don't want you to come.

07:50.560 --> 07:54.109
If you see what I mean. Bye.

07:58.360 --> 08:01.875
I was watching that.
- TV can't replace the art of conversation.

08:01.960 --> 08:04.838
It can when it's Bad Girls
and you're the one talking.

08:04.920 --> 08:09.596
I think Jo and Pete are on a date.
- Oh, my God! Leave out nothing.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.592
It's an absolute minefield.

08:13.680 --> 08:17.036
Anyone I recommend for redundancy
is bound to hold it against me.

08:17.120 --> 08:20.157
If they're out of a job,
there's not much they can do about it.

08:20.240 --> 08:23.516
Yeah, I suppose I should be thankful
for small mercies.

08:23.600 --> 08:26.160
So, how was your first day?

08:26.240 --> 08:28.356
Good. Very good, thanks.

08:29.760 --> 08:32.034
I think I'm going to enjoy being
back at work.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.957
You don't mind, do you?

08:35.039 --> 08:39.158
What? The fact that you're at work
or the fact that you enjoy it?

08:39.240 --> 08:40.912
Darling, I think it's great.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.595
You were never really very happy
being one of those ladies who lunch.

08:44.680 --> 08:46.159
David, I was never that.

08:46.240 --> 08:48.834
Oh, you've been seen in Wilmslow
once or twice.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.798
Look, so long as you're happy, darling,
you know?

08:52.880 --> 08:55.235
Yeah.
- I think that's great for us all.

08:56.840 --> 08:59.559
It does mean I'm going to be
a bit more tired.

09:00.840 --> 09:02.796
Oh.

09:04.240 --> 09:08.153
Would a massage help? - No, thanks,
darling. I'd rather just go to sleep.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.031
Night.

09:12.080 --> 09:13.672
Good night.

09:16.680 --> 09:19.513
You know how they say
pregnant women have cravings?

09:19.600 --> 09:22.319
Yeah, what's yours? Peanut butter on celery?

09:22.400 --> 09:24.595
Avocados? Coal?

09:25.680 --> 09:26.954
You.

09:27.040 --> 09:30.396
Sorry?
- I want sex, Adam.

09:38.720 --> 09:39.789
Eh?

09:40.720 --> 09:42.597
I think it must be my hormones.

09:42.680 --> 09:45.513
Well, I mean,
wha-wha-what about your jet lag?

09:45.600 --> 09:47.033
Second wind.

09:47.120 --> 09:51.557
Look, but Rachel. We haven't talked
since you got home, not properly.

09:51.640 --> 09:53.551
Come on. Get them off.

09:53.640 --> 09:55.676
I've thought of some names for the baby!

09:55.760 --> 09:59.116
Adam, I've told you.
I don't want to talk about that now.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.475
Ah, but you know, I mean...

10:01.560 --> 10:06.156
Now it's starting to erm...take shape,
I want to put a name to it.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.356
Come on.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.749
Go on, then.

10:11.840 --> 10:15.037
Er...right. Now...

10:15.120 --> 10:19.636
if it's a boy, what about Ryan or Roy?

10:19.720 --> 10:23.110
Right. Giggs or Keane.
- Difficult choice, I admit.

10:23.200 --> 10:25.589
Does it have to be a Manchester
United player?

10:25.680 --> 10:28.399
Yes. Maybe not current.

10:28.480 --> 10:29.993
Bobby.

10:30.080 --> 10:32.548
I prefer Robbie.

10:32.640 --> 10:35.108
That would make him Robbie Williams.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.156
No, Robbie Bradley.

10:53.360 --> 10:54.315
Jo?

10:54.400 --> 10:56.868
Yes?
- Wait.

10:57.960 --> 11:00.633
I don't think we should rush into anything.

11:00.720 --> 11:02.233
No?

11:02.320 --> 11:03.673
No.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.592
Oh.

11:06.680 --> 11:08.318
OK.

11:11.400 --> 11:15.029
I might just go and see if there's erm...
if there's any footie on.

11:22.520 --> 11:24.078
Oh, bugger!

11:26.240 --> 11:29.915
My game always goes to pot
when I'm not...you know.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.434
Again? I thought you were.

11:32.520 --> 11:34.829
No, not since Karen started her new job.

11:34.920 --> 11:36.751
She's been a bit too tired.

11:39.040 --> 11:40.917
It's ironic, considering a week ago

11:41.000 --> 11:44.151
I was the only one of us having sex
and now I'm the only one not.

11:44.240 --> 11:47.789
Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:51.040 --> 11:52.393
Oh, shite!

11:56.160 --> 11:58.196
We're not having sex, either.

12:04.680 --> 12:05.999
So, in fact...

12:06.080 --> 12:08.310
Pete's the only one of us having sex.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.956
Oh, bollocks.

12:19.520 --> 12:21.590
I'm just crap at golf, that's all.

12:29.080 --> 12:32.117
Are you sure he's having sex?
- I think he's having too much.

12:33.760 --> 12:36.274
What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

12:37.320 --> 12:41.233
Well, it's just Jo...Jo...

12:41.320 --> 12:45.438
has a fairly healthy appetite,
judging by the stories she's told Rachel.

12:46.520 --> 12:47.953
What stories?

12:48.040 --> 12:50.156
I don't know. Rachel wouldn't tell me.

12:50.240 --> 12:52.231
You can imagine.

12:52.320 --> 12:55.357
Come on. Look at her track record.
Her boss, Suggs, you.

12:55.440 --> 12:58.193
All in the past three months.
Pretty good effort.

12:58.280 --> 13:00.430
Look at your track record before Rachel.

13:00.520 --> 13:04.308
Oh, yeah. Well, that was different.
- Oh, why? Because you're a man, a stud?

13:04.400 --> 13:05.674
Well...

13:06.760 --> 13:09.194
So you're telling me you think
that Jo's a slapper?

13:09.280 --> 13:13.398
Well, that's not a very nice word.
- Oh, which would you prefer?

13:13.480 --> 13:15.710
Slut, slag, slattern?

13:15.800 --> 13:17.597
It's funny how they all begin with S.

13:19.240 --> 13:23.233
Except trollop, of course.
Pete, come on. I'm pulling your leg!

13:24.320 --> 13:26.959
You have to admit, though,
she does put it about a bit.

13:34.880 --> 13:39.078
Listen, here. If I hear you talk about Jo
like that one more time,

13:39.160 --> 13:41.276
I will rip your throat out.

13:41.360 --> 13:42.918
Right?

13:47.640 --> 13:49.596
He's a bit touchy, isn't he?

13:51.360 --> 13:53.032
Thank you.

13:55.440 --> 13:58.716
Mark, you don't think your secretary
suspects anything, do you?

13:58.800 --> 14:01.394
Jill? Why on earth should she?

14:01.480 --> 14:04.438
Well, you don't take your other editors
out for lunch.

14:04.520 --> 14:06.750
They don't have a book coming out in a week.

14:06.840 --> 14:08.796
Written by your wife.

14:09.920 --> 14:11.148
Yes.

14:12.040 --> 14:15.476
So, how's the er...launch party
coming, then?

14:15.560 --> 14:17.198
Really well, good.

14:17.280 --> 14:19.748
Geraldine's looking forward to it.
So's David.

14:21.080 --> 14:22.877
Right.

14:23.920 --> 14:27.959
You know, we don't really need
to beat ourselves up about this.

14:28.040 --> 14:31.271
We haven't...actually done anything yet.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.798
We kissed.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.756
Yes, and it was very nice, wasn't it?

14:41.440 --> 14:43.396
So...

14:44.840 --> 14:47.991
Why don't you have lunch with me on Friday
at the Buccina?

14:50.960 --> 14:52.916
What? The hotel?

14:54.200 --> 14:56.839
This will just be a little cold.

14:56.920 --> 14:58.558
Oh, God. You all right?

14:58.640 --> 15:00.596
Yeah. I'm fine.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.991
Oh, God. Look.

15:06.080 --> 15:08.389
Strong image.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.634
It all looks good.
- That's good.

15:12.720 --> 15:14.358
I'll take some measurements.

15:14.440 --> 15:16.351
Oh.

15:16.440 --> 15:18.351
Erm...can you tell its sex?

15:18.440 --> 15:20.476
Adam.
- What?

15:20.560 --> 15:23.916
We said we didn't want to know.
- I know, but I do now. Can you?

15:24.000 --> 15:26.355
I don't.
- Rachel, this late in the day, look...

15:26.440 --> 15:30.672
Yeah, but something could still go wrong.
- Don't be saying that, he might hear you.

15:30.760 --> 15:32.352
It is a he, isn't it? A boy?

15:32.440 --> 15:34.351
Adam, we agreed we didn't want to know.

15:34.440 --> 15:35.953
Well, it's a good size.

15:36.040 --> 15:38.235
For a boy or a girl?

15:38.320 --> 15:40.515
Adam!
- What?

15:44.680 --> 15:46.033
Come in.

15:47.440 --> 15:50.671
David, could I have a word?

15:50.760 --> 15:54.070
Of course, Charles, of course.
My door is always open.

15:54.960 --> 15:56.313
Yes.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.993
I should finish the report you want
by this afternoon.

16:02.080 --> 16:03.718
There's no hurry, Charles.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.958
Was that it?

16:10.040 --> 16:10.995
Yes.

16:15.080 --> 16:17.150
Did you know we've recently moved house?

16:17.240 --> 16:18.434
No...

16:18.520 --> 16:20.476
No, somewhere nice?

16:20.560 --> 16:21.959
Yes, very.

16:22.040 --> 16:25.874
Well, it's bigger.
The mortgage is something of a burden.

16:25.960 --> 16:29.873
But, well, we had to...
with a fourth child on the way.

16:29.960 --> 16:34.033
Of course, they're not cheap themselves.
Well, you know.

16:34.120 --> 16:36.076
You've got three, haven't you?

16:36.160 --> 16:37.718
Yes.

16:41.560 --> 16:44.632
David, please don't sack me.

16:44.720 --> 16:46.756
Francesca's not working.

16:46.840 --> 16:49.115
We really need my salary.

16:49.200 --> 16:52.397
I'll do anything... - What makes you think
that I'm cutting staff?

16:54.920 --> 16:58.959
Sir Donald's barber heard him on his phone.
- His barber?

16:59.040 --> 17:01.759
Goes out with Trudy from the mail room.

17:02.920 --> 17:04.876
Oh, marvellous.

17:06.200 --> 17:07.155
So...

17:07.240 --> 17:08.832
everyone knows, do they?

17:08.920 --> 17:10.876
You must have noticed the atmosphere.

17:12.760 --> 17:14.432
Yes. Yes, of course.

17:14.520 --> 17:17.671
Listen, Charles.
Look, it really isn't my decision.

17:17.760 --> 17:20.558
I've simply been asked
to make some recommendations,

17:20.640 --> 17:22.869
look at one or two options.

17:22.960 --> 17:27.078
So the fact that my name
appears on this list

17:27.160 --> 17:29.993
doesn't necessarily mean anything?

17:31.680 --> 17:33.432
Where did you get this?

17:34.320 --> 17:36.117
From your wastepaper basket...

17:36.200 --> 17:38.270
after you'd gone home last night.

17:46.720 --> 17:49.359
Karen?
- What are you doing here?

17:49.440 --> 17:51.795
I'm bidding a final farewell to fashion.

17:51.880 --> 17:54.519
I am buying maternity clothes.
- Come for coffee.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.238
You're hurting me.
- Sorry.

17:56.320 --> 18:00.393
Rach, when we bumped into each other,
I was meant to be meeting Mark.

18:00.480 --> 18:03.677
At the Buccina? Why didn't you say?
The food's excellent.

18:03.760 --> 18:06.672
Didn't want to go.
- Why not?

18:06.760 --> 18:08.591
No...

18:08.680 --> 18:10.477
part of me wanted to go.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.949
Sorry, I don't follow.

18:14.360 --> 18:17.352
He hadn't booked us a table,
he'd booked us a room.

18:19.920 --> 18:22.036
No!

18:25.480 --> 18:28.552
Sorry, I didn't realise it was you.
- Are you sensitive to light?

18:28.640 --> 18:31.154
Yes, and staring.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.356
So, what progress have you made?

18:33.440 --> 18:37.353
To be honest, I haven't yet identified
any jobs that might be cut.

18:37.440 --> 18:41.353
David, I am getting pressure
from Sir Donald on this.

18:41.440 --> 18:44.079
If you won't find
some sacrificial lambs, well...

18:44.160 --> 18:45.991
I will.

18:49.120 --> 18:50.838
Do it, David.

18:53.720 --> 18:55.711
This is not some fling.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.711
What else is lunchtime shagging?

18:57.800 --> 19:00.712
We haven't slept together yet.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.995
And it wouldn't be shagging.

19:04.480 --> 19:06.072
I think I'm in love with him.

19:08.360 --> 19:10.032
When did all this happen?

19:12.520 --> 19:14.476
The moment we met, don't know.

19:16.680 --> 19:18.636
But I've got all the symptoms.

19:20.160 --> 19:23.869
I live for the moment when we're together
and then I erm...

19:23.960 --> 19:26.315
think about him all the time that we're not.

19:27.840 --> 19:29.796
Remember what that's like?

19:31.720 --> 19:32.914
Vaguely.

19:35.440 --> 19:38.796
For the first time, you know,
in years, I feel alive.

19:38.880 --> 19:40.632
What about David and your children?

19:40.720 --> 19:42.312
Are you going to leave them?

19:42.400 --> 19:46.678
I don't know. I can't think that far ahead.
Yes, no, maybe? I don't know.

19:47.720 --> 19:50.314
I think I married the wrong person.

19:51.520 --> 19:55.593
No, that's not true. I married
the right person for who I was then.

19:57.160 --> 19:59.674
But I think we may have run our course.

20:02.120 --> 20:04.076
And I think Mark might be my future.

20:05.960 --> 20:07.916
Oh, my God.

20:09.040 --> 20:10.951
What shall I do?

20:13.080 --> 20:15.833
Karen, only you can decide that.

20:19.440 --> 20:21.396
I just want you to be happy.

20:24.040 --> 20:26.600
I don't think you've been happy
for a long time.

20:30.160 --> 20:32.549
Shit. He's probably gone.

20:32.640 --> 20:34.596
We haven't paid the bill.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.550
I'll get the bill.

20:43.920 --> 20:46.639
I er... I actually thought that
you weren't coming.

20:46.720 --> 20:48.870
Well, I wasn't.

20:48.960 --> 20:50.916
I don't understand.
- Shut up.

21:03.280 --> 21:07.717
Do you think getting dressed after sex
is God's way of making you feel guilty?

21:07.800 --> 21:13.352
I don't know, but pulling your socks on
does rather spoil the romance, doesn't it?

21:13.440 --> 21:16.273
Yeah. Well, taking them off
wasn't exactly sexy.

21:16.360 --> 21:18.112
I know.

21:27.520 --> 21:29.476
Mark, I'm not sure I can do this.

21:33.600 --> 21:35.556
What? You want us to stop?

21:36.640 --> 21:38.551
No.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.477
I just...

21:41.560 --> 21:46.076
I just don't want it to become something
that we do every Tuesday lunchtime.

21:46.160 --> 21:49.436
Well, actually, Tuesdays
aren't terribly good for me.

21:51.760 --> 21:54.194
I'm being serious.
- Yeah. Well, so am I.

21:59.800 --> 22:01.756
Listen to me.

22:03.200 --> 22:07.034
Karen, I think that you are
absolutely amazing.

22:09.440 --> 22:12.637
And if I could,
I would spend every moment with you.

22:15.200 --> 22:17.156
But failing that...

22:18.400 --> 22:21.392
I'll just...take what I can get.

22:24.680 --> 22:27.069
That didn't sound very good, did it?

22:27.160 --> 22:29.116
No.
- No.

22:33.080 --> 22:36.390
Hey, what time do you have to be
back at the office?

22:36.480 --> 22:38.436
I don't know. Whenever.

22:39.480 --> 22:41.436
Then get your socks off.

23:06.440 --> 23:08.396
Oh, shit.

23:29.320 --> 23:31.151
Oh, what are you doing?

23:32.320 --> 23:34.197
Nothing.

23:34.280 --> 23:36.191
Come on, Josh, darling.

23:36.280 --> 23:38.111
It's time for bed.

23:38.200 --> 23:40.156
Night-night, Josh.

23:47.160 --> 23:49.515
<i>Eh, alors, ou etals tu?</i>

23:49.600 --> 23:52.068
Who chose this?
- I did.

23:52.160 --> 23:54.628
Typical French. Magnifique.

23:54.720 --> 23:56.676
Oooh! Sexy.

23:57.720 --> 24:00.075
It is, isn't it?

24:02.480 --> 24:03.959
<i>Mol aussl.</i>

24:04.040 --> 24:06.156
<i>Je t'adore.</i>

24:06.240 --> 24:08.196
<i>Tu es sl belle, ma cherie.</i>

24:11.240 --> 24:12.832
Come on. We should go.

24:12.920 --> 24:14.239
Why?

24:14.320 --> 24:17.676
Because I'm tired, being pregnant and all.

24:17.760 --> 24:19.398
On your feet.

24:19.480 --> 24:21.869
No. Listen, don't get up.
Don't get up. Right.

24:23.600 --> 24:26.433
See you... Bye.

24:26.520 --> 24:28.875
What about the film?

24:28.960 --> 24:30.552
I thought you didn't like it.

24:30.640 --> 24:33.029
Well, I didn't.
But I want to know what happens.

24:33.120 --> 24:34.997
Well, I know. I've seen it.

24:35.080 --> 24:37.753
So?
- So take me home and I'll show you.

24:55.320 --> 24:59.359
<i>Mon amour, j'al tant attendu pour ce moment.</i>

24:59.440 --> 25:01.635
<i>Voulez-vous coucher avec mol, ce soir?</i>

25:02.800 --> 25:04.756
<i>Oul! Oul!</i>

25:04.840 --> 25:07.957
Oh...God.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.996
Jo, wait.

25:10.080 --> 25:12.196
Wait?

25:12.280 --> 25:14.635
I really like you.

25:14.720 --> 25:16.995
Well, good.
- No, no, no, no.

25:17.080 --> 25:20.038
I mean I really like you.

25:20.120 --> 25:23.157
That's why I think we shouldn't go too fast.

25:23.240 --> 25:25.196
What? Still?

25:25.280 --> 25:27.953
I just think we should wait
until the time's right.

25:28.040 --> 25:29.996
But I thought it was right.

25:33.920 --> 25:35.876
OK.

25:47.240 --> 25:49.037
What does she see in him, you know?

25:49.120 --> 25:50.872
She's gorgeous, he's a big lump.

25:53.760 --> 25:57.275
Ah, Rachel.
- This is how the film ends.

25:57.360 --> 26:00.477
Well, no. Actually, she murders him.
But before that...

26:01.520 --> 26:04.432
Er...Rach. Erm...I've just eaten.

26:05.480 --> 26:07.550
So?

26:07.640 --> 26:11.553
Oh, God. Adam, is this still to do
with the baby's name?

26:11.640 --> 26:13.153
No, no.

26:13.240 --> 26:16.550
But, actually, we need to resolve that.
Tea, come on.

26:26.240 --> 26:28.959
I don't know why
you're being so difficult about this.

26:29.040 --> 26:31.395
You see? That is what annoys me.

26:31.480 --> 26:33.994
The assumption that I'm the one
being difficult.

26:34.080 --> 26:35.559
Yeah? Well, you are.

26:35.640 --> 26:39.394
Well, if you accept that children
should take their father's name.

26:39.480 --> 26:41.436
The world does.

26:44.560 --> 26:49.111
OK, how about we give it both our surnames?

26:49.200 --> 26:52.795
What? Like George Williams-Bradley?

26:52.880 --> 26:54.711
Yeah, or Bradley-Williams.

26:54.800 --> 26:58.429
Oh, you're arguing about billing.
Anyway, double-barrelled.

26:59.480 --> 27:02.119
We could toss a coin.
- Yeah.

27:02.200 --> 27:03.155
No.

27:06.880 --> 27:10.714
All right. What if...
if it's a boy, it takes your name,

27:10.800 --> 27:13.030
and if it's a girl it takes mine?

27:13.120 --> 27:15.076
Well...

27:16.440 --> 27:18.396
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe.

27:19.640 --> 27:21.596
Are you tired?

27:23.240 --> 27:25.196
Not really.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.192
Really?

27:29.240 --> 27:31.674
I've got an early start in
the morning, darling.

27:32.920 --> 27:34.069
Night.

27:37.880 --> 27:39.836
Good night.

28:06.560 --> 28:08.073
Shite!

28:28.080 --> 28:30.230
Bollocks to this.
Let's go and get a drink.

28:30.320 --> 28:31.992
Yeah.

28:32.080 --> 28:34.036
Want the ball?
- No.

28:45.560 --> 28:47.312
So, my secretary's gone.

28:49.280 --> 28:50.429
Finally.

28:59.680 --> 29:02.274
Has she?
- Yes.

29:16.600 --> 29:18.909
Hang on. Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

29:19.960 --> 29:22.838
Geraldine's invitations to the book launch.

29:33.560 --> 29:35.471
Right. See you in a couple of months.

29:35.560 --> 29:37.516
Thank you. Bye.

29:40.480 --> 29:42.471
Hi.
- Oh, hello.

29:42.560 --> 29:44.516
I was just erm...

29:46.080 --> 29:47.274
..passing.

29:47.360 --> 29:49.669
Er...could I have a wee word?

29:49.760 --> 29:51.159
Sure.

29:51.240 --> 29:53.196
Oh, God!

29:59.120 --> 30:01.076
Karen!
- Ohh!

30:01.160 --> 30:03.116
God!

30:05.560 --> 30:09.075
I haven't seen you in a while,
I thought I'd catch up on things.

30:09.160 --> 30:14.393
Yeah? And you want to talk about something
you don't want to tell the others, huh?

30:14.480 --> 30:16.948
I don't mind - so long as it's good.

30:17.040 --> 30:19.873
So, come on. Drop your beans.

30:19.960 --> 30:21.916
We still haven't had sex.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.912
Still? I thought it was going really well.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.878
I mean, last night...
- Yeah. I don't know.

30:27.960 --> 30:30.599
Pete and I have such a laugh together.

30:30.680 --> 30:34.229
He's the first guy I've been out with
who I can actually have fun with

30:34.320 --> 30:36.276
and he doesn't get all heavy on me.

30:36.360 --> 30:41.115
That's the great thing about Jo. She doesn't
just laugh at my jokes. She's like...Jenny.

30:41.200 --> 30:43.555
She shares my sense of humour.

30:48.840 --> 30:50.796
No, no.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.116
So what do you think the problem is?

30:55.200 --> 30:57.156
He doesn't fancy me.

30:57.240 --> 31:00.869
Oh, bollocks. Course he does.
- So why doesn't he want to get physical?

31:00.960 --> 31:02.916
Because I'm worried that...

31:03.000 --> 31:07.630
when I get my kit off, she'll see me for
exactly what I am - a frog, not a prince.

31:07.720 --> 31:10.792
Come on, Pete. Stop being so down
on yourself.

31:10.880 --> 31:13.519
Do you know, you are a really great guy.

31:13.600 --> 31:15.795
Anyway, it's probably for the best.

31:17.040 --> 31:18.996
How do you mean?

31:19.080 --> 31:21.036
My visa's run out.
- Ah.

31:22.160 --> 31:24.958
I've got to leave the country.
- What, really?

31:25.040 --> 31:26.996
Yeah.
- Oh, no.

31:28.360 --> 31:30.555
Well, surely you can get it renewed.

31:30.640 --> 31:33.029
With working visas it's not that simple.

31:33.120 --> 31:37.432
There must be something you can do.
- Faced with British bureaucracy?

31:37.520 --> 31:39.590
Trust me, I've tried everything.

31:39.680 --> 31:42.638
I don't know. My time's up and that's that.

31:43.760 --> 31:45.716
Well, have you told Pete that?

31:47.160 --> 31:50.357
Look, girls...they don't care
what you look like.

31:50.440 --> 31:52.396
It's how they look.

31:52.480 --> 31:54.869
And Jo? She likes you.

31:56.240 --> 31:59.277
You...and your big old cojones.

31:59.360 --> 32:01.635
OK?
- OK.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.433
Come in.

32:14.040 --> 32:15.996
What are you doing?

32:16.080 --> 32:18.036
Packing.

32:18.120 --> 32:20.076
I'm going back to Oz.

32:21.520 --> 32:24.717
Why?
- Visa's run out.

32:24.800 --> 32:27.360
So you just get another one.
- Yeah, maybe.

32:28.400 --> 32:31.392
Hey, Jo. Jo, come on.

32:32.480 --> 32:35.074
Look, Pete, let's be honest, you know.

32:35.160 --> 32:37.151
It's not really working out between us.

32:44.080 --> 32:45.593
Is that what you think?

32:47.760 --> 32:49.716
Did you come in for something?

32:52.720 --> 32:54.676
No. It doesn't matter.

33:02.320 --> 33:04.276
Karen?

33:05.440 --> 33:07.396
Ramona?

33:12.000 --> 33:14.070
You have one message.

33:19.800 --> 33:21.756
Oh, God.

33:26.360 --> 33:28.316
Oh, God.

33:31.680 --> 33:35.878
Oh, Christ. Oh, Christ. Oh, Christ.

33:35.960 --> 33:38.554
Oh, God. Oh, God.

33:38.640 --> 33:41.996
Kar...

33:43.440 --> 33:44.634
Disgusting.

33:44.720 --> 33:47.314
<i>Message deleted. End of messages.</i>

33:54.320 --> 33:56.993
Hello, Joshy. Oh, great picture.

33:57.080 --> 33:59.594
Hi.
- Hello, darling. Good day.

34:00.480 --> 34:02.550
Yes, thanks. Wonderful.

34:08.199 --> 34:11.237
I've been thinking about the name
for the baby.

34:11.320 --> 34:13.275
Oh, bloody hell.
- No, no, look.

34:13.360 --> 34:15.476
I think we should go with your idea.

34:15.560 --> 34:19.348
If it's a boy, it takes my name.
If it's a girl, it takes yours.

34:20.480 --> 34:23.152
Are you sure? You don't mind?

34:23.239 --> 34:25.674
Well, yeah, it is a bit of a risk, but...

34:25.760 --> 34:27.716
we've got to find a compromise.

34:29.600 --> 34:32.319
OK, great. I'll tell you what.

34:32.400 --> 34:34.708
If it's a girl, you can choose
the first name.

34:34.800 --> 34:37.917
Well, I wouldn't worry about that.
- Why not?

34:40.400 --> 34:44.188
Well, um...
because there's a 50/50 chance it won't be.

34:45.880 --> 34:47.835
You've found out the sex.

34:47.920 --> 34:50.592
No, I haven't.
- Yes, you have, it's a boy.

34:50.679 --> 34:52.750
He might not be.
- You bloody bastard!

34:52.840 --> 34:55.274
I didn't want to know!
- I didn't want to tell you.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.954
I can see that! Just back off, will you?

34:58.040 --> 35:00.395
Stop forcing me to do things your way.

35:09.120 --> 35:13.079
It's funny, I...seem to spend
half my life at airports

35:13.160 --> 35:15.116
saying goodbye to people I care about.

35:16.200 --> 35:18.156
You really care about me?

35:19.240 --> 35:20.514
Yeah.

35:21.960 --> 35:23.916
Just not in that way.

35:25.920 --> 35:27.876
What way?

35:27.960 --> 35:31.714
Flight BA21 direct to Sydney
is now boarding.

35:31.800 --> 35:34.360
They're boarding. I'd better go.

35:34.440 --> 35:36.396
Get some duty free.

35:38.920 --> 35:40.876
I'll miss you.

35:43.880 --> 35:45.836
I'll miss you too.

35:49.280 --> 35:51.236
OK, I'll see you.

35:52.280 --> 35:54.396
Bye.

35:54.480 --> 35:57.278
<i>Boarding pass, please.</i>

35:59.240 --> 36:01.196
Thank you, madam.

36:22.320 --> 36:24.276
Hello. Nice to see you.

36:24.360 --> 36:26.430
It's great, isn't it?
- Very good.

36:26.520 --> 36:29.751
Hello. You look stunning.

36:29.840 --> 36:31.876
Thank you.

36:33.880 --> 36:36.792
I have to say you've done a fantastic job.

36:36.880 --> 36:39.474
Well...I aim to please.

36:42.040 --> 36:44.156
I'll er...speak to you in a minute.

36:48.480 --> 36:51.552
How's it going?
- Really well.

36:51.640 --> 36:54.598
Good reviews. Lots of interest
from the press.

36:54.680 --> 36:57.194
No, I didn't mean the book launch.

36:58.240 --> 37:00.196
Oh.

37:01.320 --> 37:03.276
Great.

37:03.360 --> 37:05.476
Bit weird being here with his wife.

37:07.080 --> 37:10.470
He doesn't seem too bothered.
- Yeah, well...

37:11.920 --> 37:14.036
Love makes liars of us all, Rachel.

37:14.120 --> 37:16.111
Hello, darling.
- Hello.

37:16.200 --> 37:18.156
Rachel.
- David.

37:18.240 --> 37:20.310
So, how's it going?
- Really well.

37:20.400 --> 37:23.790
Good reviews, lots of interest
from the press. - Great.

37:23.880 --> 37:26.155
I'm so proud of you.

37:26.240 --> 37:28.435
Jo get off all right?

37:28.520 --> 37:30.636
Mm.
- Ah, well, we're going to miss her.

37:30.720 --> 37:33.029
Yeah, I will.
- You would. No more sex.

37:33.120 --> 37:35.076
No.
- Mm-hm.

37:35.160 --> 37:38.436
You wanker. You never cracked it.
Rachel told me.

37:38.520 --> 37:41.193
Oh, God.
- Carrying on like you were an item.

37:41.280 --> 37:44.431
Well, we were.
- My arse. You never got near her bra.

37:48.120 --> 37:50.076
You all right, Pete?
- No.

37:50.160 --> 37:52.674
Jolly good. Karen's brilliant at this.

37:52.760 --> 37:55.752
Just as well, since
we may soon have to rely on her income.

37:57.880 --> 38:00.997
Pete, I was asked to recommend
some redundancies -

38:01.080 --> 38:03.036
Operation Poisoned Chalice.

38:03.120 --> 38:05.714
So I drew up these three different lists.

38:05.800 --> 38:08.314
Who I don't like, who's a waste of space,

38:08.400 --> 38:10.516
who's not worth what they're paid.

38:10.600 --> 38:14.912
I put myself on that one.
Not serious but just for my own amusement.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.355
But, unfortunately...

38:17.440 --> 38:19.510
Helen, how do you save a document?

38:19.600 --> 38:21.556
Just click on Save.

38:25.640 --> 38:27.596
Erm...

38:29.680 --> 38:32.638
No, that was Send.
- Send?

38:32.720 --> 38:35.154
Who have I sent it to?
- The whole office.

38:38.680 --> 38:42.753
<i>This is outrageous.
I can't believe it. What is going on?</i>

38:42.840 --> 38:45.229
<i>It was a complete nightmare.</i>

38:45.320 --> 38:47.276
Oi, cop for this, will you?

38:49.920 --> 38:52.718
Thanks for that.
- Not at all. You're welcome.

38:52.800 --> 38:55.155
Thank you.
- Could I borrow Geraldine?

38:55.240 --> 38:57.196
Uh-huh.
- Excuse me.

38:58.600 --> 39:00.795
Oi. Oi. Listen here.

39:00.880 --> 39:03.872
You're the wanker, not me.
- What?

39:03.960 --> 39:06.428
You've never doubted that women
all fancy you.

39:06.520 --> 39:10.433
But I do. That's why I never got it on
with Jo. I never even tried.

39:10.520 --> 39:13.318
Because she's way out of my league.
- Pete...

39:13.400 --> 39:16.153
And the moment she realises this,
I'll get hurt.

39:16.240 --> 39:17.832
I'll even tell you this:

39:17.920 --> 39:20.480
I think I'm in love with her.

39:20.560 --> 39:23.552
That's why I want her as a friend,
not as an ex.

39:23.640 --> 39:25.596
Hang on a minute.

39:25.680 --> 39:28.319
She feels exactly the same about you.

39:28.400 --> 39:31.472
What?
- Yeah, she told me before she left.

39:31.560 --> 39:33.551
She's absolutely mad about you.

39:33.640 --> 39:35.596
What, me?
- Yeah.

39:35.680 --> 39:37.716
But I'm me.

39:37.800 --> 39:42.237
Well, exactly. You do it for her.
You know what she likes best?

39:42.320 --> 39:44.709
No.
- You make her laugh.

39:46.200 --> 39:48.873
But she didn't think that you fancied her.

39:50.160 --> 39:52.116
You're joking.
- No.

39:52.200 --> 39:54.794
Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

39:54.880 --> 39:57.235
Karen, do you think I might have a word,
please?

39:57.320 --> 39:59.276
Yeah, sure.

39:59.360 --> 40:01.669
Er...you know Mark?

40:02.800 --> 40:03.755
Yeah.

40:04.840 --> 40:08.469
I...think he might be having an affair.

40:10.040 --> 40:11.519
What makes you say that?

40:11.600 --> 40:14.831
Oh, I've come to recognise the signs.

40:16.080 --> 40:18.036
Has he done it before?

40:18.120 --> 40:20.076
Once or twice.

40:22.160 --> 40:23.912
Hasn't he mentioned it?

40:25.000 --> 40:25.955
No.

40:26.040 --> 40:27.792
Why would he?

40:29.520 --> 40:31.476
I'm not angry, Karen.

40:32.560 --> 40:36.394
In fact, I suspect you're taking it
a little more seriously than he is.

40:36.480 --> 40:38.675
But then, that's happened before as well.

40:41.080 --> 40:43.514
Come on. I ought to make a speech.

40:56.080 --> 40:57.399
What?

40:57.480 --> 41:01.598
This name thing.
It's really important to you, isn't it?

41:01.680 --> 41:05.639
Ah, Rach, I don't know.
It's like a man thing, you know.

41:07.880 --> 41:10.838
Let's hope the young Mr Williams
doesn't inherit it.

41:10.920 --> 41:12.876
Really?

41:12.960 --> 41:14.916
Yes.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.275
Thank you.
- But one thing.

41:17.360 --> 41:20.318
I'd like to give him my grandad's
first name.

41:20.400 --> 41:23.517
Wasn't something like Hilary
or Vivian, was it?

41:23.600 --> 41:27.309
No. But none of the United team
are called it, I've checked.

41:27.400 --> 41:29.436
What is it?
- Matthew.

41:29.520 --> 41:31.670
Matthew? Ah, terrific!

41:31.760 --> 41:33.512
Really?
- Yeah, Matthew.

41:33.600 --> 41:36.273
Matt Busby. Whoo-hoo. Ah, come here to me.

41:41.040 --> 41:44.112
Look, I'm sorry if I've been
a bit full-on lately.

41:44.200 --> 41:46.998
I'll try and be more sensitive
to your needs.

41:47.080 --> 41:49.355
Can we start with sex, please?
- What?

41:49.440 --> 41:52.318
Well, I mean, we've not done it for ages.

41:52.400 --> 41:54.516
And I'm getting really quite desperate.

42:00.560 --> 42:02.790
My God, Adam.
- What?

42:02.880 --> 42:05.553
You don't fancy me any more, now I'm big.
- Yeah, I do.

42:05.640 --> 42:08.234
No, you don't. You think I'm some
fat, old whale.

42:08.320 --> 42:10.276
No, no, darling...I don't.

42:10.360 --> 42:12.316
It's just our son's up there.

42:12.400 --> 42:14.277
It's a bit rude to go poking about.

42:14.360 --> 42:17.397
No offence,
but I don't think you're going to reach.

42:19.520 --> 42:23.274
Rachel, I do like your bump.

42:24.520 --> 42:26.954
Are you sure?
- Yeah, I love it. It's gorgeous.

42:27.040 --> 42:28.996
But...you know...

42:33.160 --> 42:35.116
Oh, sweetheart, I think...

42:35.200 --> 42:37.156
I think he's asleep.

42:37.240 --> 42:40.471
And if we go really quietly,

42:40.560 --> 42:42.516
I don't think he'll wake up.

42:44.240 --> 42:46.196
Come on.

43:05.920 --> 43:09.196
Natalie. I'm just trying to write
to Sir Donald.

43:10.440 --> 43:13.159
Too late, David, the damage has been done.

43:14.240 --> 43:15.878
My God, has it?

43:16.920 --> 43:18.751
What is this?

43:18.840 --> 43:22.196
Leaving present. Enjoy.

43:22.280 --> 43:24.236
Natalie.
- Sir Donald.

43:25.280 --> 43:28.511
David. I wonder what it is?

43:28.600 --> 43:31.990
I've no idea. Look, I'll have my desk
cleared in a few minutes.

43:32.080 --> 43:35.789
Jolly good. The sooner you can get your feet
under Natalie's.

43:36.920 --> 43:38.433
Natalie's?

43:38.520 --> 43:42.195
Don't act surprised. It was your suggestion.

43:42.280 --> 43:44.236
A good memo, by the way.

43:44.320 --> 43:47.118
And a nice touch, adding your own name.

43:47.200 --> 43:49.191
Brave.

43:49.280 --> 43:51.635
The sort of leadership this firm needs.

43:54.640 --> 43:56.278
Silver coins.

43:56.360 --> 43:57.759
Yes.

43:58.920 --> 44:00.876
30 of them, I should imagine.

44:00.960 --> 44:04.430
No. No, Ian, I said Tuesday

44:04.520 --> 44:06.476
and I mean Tuesday.

44:06.560 --> 44:10.553
Right, yeah. I'll have to call you back.
Yeah. Bye.

44:10.640 --> 44:12.835
Why didn't you tell me you've
done this before?

44:13.920 --> 44:15.399
What?

44:15.480 --> 44:17.436
This. Us.

44:19.080 --> 44:21.036
Geraldine knows.

44:24.960 --> 44:26.916
Karen, listen to me.

44:29.240 --> 44:31.196
I am in love with you.

44:33.800 --> 44:36.837
Absolutely and utterly in love with you.

44:41.240 --> 44:44.789
She could tell David any time she wants.

44:49.400 --> 44:51.755
Well, then, that's that, then, isn't it?

44:52.920 --> 44:54.876
We're over.

44:54.960 --> 44:56.916
No. No.

44:58.160 --> 45:01.436
I'll leave her and you leave David.

45:04.240 --> 45:06.196
Hm?

45:19.160 --> 45:21.116
What's that?

45:21.200 --> 45:23.873
What time is it?
- I don't know.

45:23.960 --> 45:25.916
Oh.

45:31.840 --> 45:34.149
Hello.
- Hello, Adam, mate. It's me.

45:34.240 --> 45:36.674
Pete, have you any idea what time it is?

45:36.760 --> 45:38.512
Yes, it's quarter to twelve.

45:38.600 --> 45:41.353
No, it's not.
- It is here, mate.

45:41.440 --> 45:46.070
Hang on. I've got someone
who wants to say hello to you.

45:47.720 --> 45:49.676
Adam, it's Jo. Hey.

45:49.760 --> 45:52.479
Listen, I'm so sorry.
Pete insisted that we call.

45:52.560 --> 45:54.630
I'll let you go back to sleep. Bye.

45:57.680 --> 46:00.638
The bollocks.
He's buggered off to Australia.

46:02.760 --> 46:05.797
Don't want this to go to your head but...

46:07.120 --> 46:09.634
..that was well worth the wait.

46:09.720 --> 46:13.429
It was well worth travelling
10000 miles for as well.

46:15.480 --> 46:17.436
I'm so glad you came.

46:17.520 --> 46:19.875
Not just for...
- The... Yeah, I get it.

46:21.480 --> 46:24.517
Next to the boyfriend
who tattooed Jo on his arm,

46:24.600 --> 46:27.990
it's the most romantic thing
anyone's ever done for me.

46:29.280 --> 46:31.919
Well, it's the daftest thing I've ever done.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.956
And the most sensible.

46:35.160 --> 46:37.116
You know...

46:38.440 --> 46:41.318
..I've only ever told one woman
that I loved her.

46:41.400 --> 46:43.356
Your mum.

46:43.440 --> 46:44.998
That's two.

46:45.080 --> 46:47.196
And do you know something?

46:48.280 --> 46:50.236
I'd like to go for the hat trick.

46:53.320 --> 46:55.276
I love you.

47:01.680 --> 47:03.636
Marry me.

47:08.440 --> 47:10.396
Jesus!

47:10.480 --> 47:12.436
Sorry, darling.

47:15.640 --> 47:18.234
What now?

47:18.320 --> 47:20.276
You're what?

47:21.305 --> 47:27.290
