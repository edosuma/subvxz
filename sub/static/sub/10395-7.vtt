This is where I bought
my first bag of heroin.

00:11.212 --> 00:13.480
It was 1980, I was 24 years old.

00:13.481 --> 00:15.382
But in a lot of ways, my whole

00:15.383 --> 00:22.389
life up to that point was
leading to this address.

00:22.390 --> 00:25.325
Western Massachusetts, the
unlikely new frontier of

00:25.326 --> 00:27.794
America's war on drugs.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.629
Where heroin has become an

00:29.630 --> 00:30.830
exploding problem that's begun

00:30.831 --> 00:36.403
to touch nearly every family.

01:26.721 --> 01:30.157
There's nothing like
the north Atlantic.

01:30.158 --> 01:31.791
It's majestic.

01:31.792 --> 01:34.194
I love the beach.

01:34.195 --> 01:36.829
Pretty much had my first
everything on a beach.

01:36.830 --> 01:40.500
You name, first time
I did it, beach.

01:40.501 --> 01:42.802
I was miserable in love, happy

01:42.803 --> 01:46.706
in love, alternately, as
only a 17-year-old could be.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.641
This is where I lived.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.210
Very happy summer in the early

01:50.211 --> 01:52.845
'70s, and that was
my room on the left.

01:52.846 --> 01:56.849
It's an amazing spot if you
think about it, a bunch of

01:56.850 --> 01:59.519
knuckle heads working as dish

01:59.520 --> 02:01.988
washers, way or
its, beach servers.

02:01.989 --> 02:04.257
We could work on a
beach like this.

02:04.258 --> 02:06.593
Happier, stupider times.

02:06.594 --> 02:09.329
You know, I can still hear the

02:09.330 --> 02:11.164
play list, the brothers Johnson.

02:11.165 --> 02:15.034
If you put on Marvin Gaye right

02:15.035 --> 02:18.838
now, I'd burst into tears.

02:18.839 --> 02:19.207
What do you do?

02:19.208 --> 02:20.873
You're young, you go to the

02:20.874 --> 02:23.843
beach, you get laid,
and you get high.

02:23.844 --> 02:28.581
It was here, all the way out
at the tip of Cape Cod,

02:28.582 --> 02:30.049
Provincetown, Massachusetts,

02:30.050 --> 02:33.019
where the pilgrims first landed.

02:33.020 --> 02:36.189
And it was where I first landed.

02:36.190 --> 02:38.258
1972, washed in a town with a

02:38.259 --> 02:42.762
headful of orange sunshine
and a few friends.

02:42.763 --> 02:44.130
Provincetown, a wonderland of

02:44.131 --> 02:45.298
tolerance, long time tradition

02:45.299 --> 02:47.133
of accepting artists, writers,

02:47.134 --> 02:50.303
the badly behaved, the
gay, the different.

02:50.304 --> 02:55.242
It was paradise.

02:55.243 --> 02:56.876
The joy that can only come with

02:56.877 --> 03:00.880
an absolute certainty
that you're invincible.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.315
None of the choices that you

03:02.316 --> 03:04.651
make will have any repercussions

03:04.652 --> 03:06.753
or any effect on
your later life.

03:06.754 --> 03:08.054
We didn't think
about those things.

03:08.055 --> 03:09.722
I don't know what I thought
I was going to be.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.391
At that point, I certainly

03:11.392 --> 03:12.892
didn't think I was
going to be a cook.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.827
I don't know what I thought
I was going to be.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.929
I was just, you know, hanging
out in a beautiful place.

03:16.930 --> 03:19.065
A golden time, I look back on

03:19.066 --> 03:23.135
those fuzzy memories and
they seem golden anyway.

03:23.136 --> 03:24.904
Oh, there's John waters.

03:24.905 --> 03:27.907
First love, and there's me.

03:27.908 --> 03:30.810
This guy, Johnny was sort of a

03:30.811 --> 03:38.084
sinful figure in
all of our lives.

03:38.085 --> 03:43.923
Well, my name is John, and
this is spiritist pizza, its

03:43.924 --> 03:46.659
been here since 1971.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.361
This town is everything to me.

03:48.362 --> 03:49.762
Provincetown is a really special

03:49.763 --> 03:51.764
place where people
can be themselves.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.633
We all did drugs, acted young

03:53.634 --> 03:56.035
and crazy, and Tony was, he was

03:56.036 --> 03:57.537
probably a little Wilder than

03:57.538 --> 03:59.372
some and not as wild as others.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.441
But he was always the
guy who I always liked.

04:01.442 --> 04:04.711
And you let me sleep on
talk of the walk in.

04:04.712 --> 04:06.813
I remember that.

04:06.814 --> 04:08.448
I cannot tell you how frequently

04:08.449 --> 04:10.450
I freem about the pizza.

04:10.451 --> 04:11.684
I'm walking down commercial

04:11.685 --> 04:14.521
street, and I'm dimly aware that

04:14.522 --> 04:15.655
spiritist has moved and there's

04:15.656 --> 04:17.189
a sense of dislocation and a

04:17.190 --> 04:19.625
loss as I stumble around this

04:19.627 --> 04:23.463
Provincetown dream
scape of 40 years ago.

04:23.464 --> 04:29.068
I was still here and
living in hope.

04:29.069 --> 04:29.637
Unbelievable.

04:29.638 --> 04:34.206
Many of the old places
in p-town are gone.

04:34.207 --> 04:35.842
But the lobster pot is still

04:35.843 --> 04:38.345
going strong, all
these years later.

04:38.346 --> 04:41.213
And still has what
I want and need.

04:41.214 --> 04:42.982
The essentials.

04:42.983 --> 04:45.017
My friends worked in the kitchen

04:45.018 --> 04:47.920
here, starting the tradition

04:47.921 --> 04:49.689
that cooking work
was noble toil.

04:49.690 --> 04:52.158
I never intended a
career as a chef.

04:52.159 --> 04:53.259
It's great to be a cook.

04:53.260 --> 04:56.496
I was getting to that.

04:56.497 --> 04:56.830
Yes.

04:56.831 --> 04:59.332
This is homemade Portuguese

04:59.333 --> 05:01.434
Kale soup, made on the premises.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.503
Its ban long time, thank you.

05:03.504 --> 05:04.504
Enjoy.

05:04.505 --> 05:11.177
Portuguese soup, a P-town
version and just what I

05:11.178 --> 05:11.679
remembered.

05:11.680 --> 05:14.547
Kale, kidney beans, potatoes.

05:14.548 --> 05:15.848
Oh, I missed you.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.717
I missed you bad.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.452
And that was precisely what I

05:19.453 --> 05:20.953
loved about the food here.

05:20.954 --> 05:22.922
The Portuguese thing, dishes

05:22.923 --> 05:25.392
like this stuffed COD crusted

05:25.393 --> 05:27.360
with sausage, bread crumbs,

05:27.361 --> 05:29.396
stuffed with scallop and crab.

05:29.397 --> 05:31.798
Some Sherry, read sauce.

05:31.799 --> 05:34.967
I hadn't been working for a
while, I was a deadbeat.

05:34.968 --> 05:37.970
Just scarfing for
everybody else.

05:37.971 --> 05:40.407
And he comes from work and says

05:40.408 --> 05:42.909
our dishwasher didn't
show up today.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.744
You are our new dishwasher.

05:44.745 --> 05:45.778
And I said really.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.414
And the next day I put on the

05:47.415 --> 05:49.882
apron and didn't take
it off for 30 years.

05:49.883 --> 05:52.919
I'd wake up, all of us go to the

05:52.920 --> 05:54.587
beach, hang out until
like 2:00, 3:00.

05:54.588 --> 05:55.888
Yeah, it was fun.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.490
Roll into work.

05:57.491 --> 05:58.791
Work all night.

05:58.792 --> 06:02.562
Drinking, getting high,
drilling out food.

06:02.563 --> 06:04.964
You have all the food you
wanted, all the liquor you

06:04.965 --> 06:05.232
wanted?

06:05.233 --> 06:06.433
All the sex you wanted.

06:06.434 --> 06:07.900
All the sex you wanted.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.569
It was true, it was fun.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.404
And still an essential
part of the economy.

06:11.405 --> 06:15.241
It was a lot of fun,
believe me, I remember.

06:15.242 --> 06:17.009
The flagship, it's where
my cooking career started.

06:17.010 --> 06:21.414
Write started washing dishes,
where I started have

06:21.415 --> 06:23.182
pretensionings of
culinary grandeur.

06:23.183 --> 06:26.653
It was a good gig for anybody?

06:26.654 --> 06:30.356
You had to be in a band, here we

06:30.357 --> 06:30.924
were, we were dish washers.

06:30.925 --> 06:32.625
Yeah you get older and more

06:32.626 --> 06:33.960
sense and you realize that like,

06:33.961 --> 06:36.596
you know, you got to like
pace yourself a little bit.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.798
Otherwise, we still
wouldn't be here.

06:38.799 --> 06:40.266
Well, you know, many of our

06:40.267 --> 06:41.868
friends from those
days didn't make it.

06:41.869 --> 06:48.108
Many of my friends
are dead, yeah.

06:49.877 --> 06:53.946
Keep drinking, keep drinking.

06:53.947 --> 06:54.214
Thank you.

06:54.215 --> 06:55.347
Thank you, Tony.

06:55.348 --> 06:56.883
This place has
been here forever.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.451
That used to be the back room.

06:58.452 --> 06:59.619
Back room's still there.

06:59.620 --> 07:02.889
See, it's all falling
into place again.

07:02.890 --> 07:03.956
Yeah.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.324
It's not that much different.

07:05.325 --> 07:06.493
It's early spring now, but

07:06.494 --> 07:08.227
come Memorial Day, it gets crazy

07:08.228 --> 07:12.231
around here, and doesn't
stop until labor day.

07:12.232 --> 07:15.234
Provincetown was always
gay-friendly, in my time and

07:15.235 --> 07:16.669
way, way before my time.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.671
And this place, the Atlantic

07:18.672 --> 07:19.906
house known always and forever

07:19.907 --> 07:22.208
by locals and visitors alike as

07:22.209 --> 07:26.212
the a house as America's
oldest operating gay bar.

07:26.213 --> 07:29.749
Everybody has come through
these doors, so to speak.

07:29.750 --> 07:37.750
Most notably, naked and
frolicy Tennessee Williams.

07:37.991 --> 07:38.191
No.

07:38.191 --> 07:38.559
That's too bad.

07:38.560 --> 07:43.395
Everybody got seasick.

07:43.396 --> 07:46.365
They all save cocktails so I
can get my sea legs back.

07:46.366 --> 07:47.167
Oh really?

07:47.167 --> 07:48.101
Yeah.

07:48.102 --> 07:50.036
April owns the joint now.

07:50.037 --> 07:55.341
Taken over for her father,
the legendary Reggie, a

07:55.342 --> 07:56.943
forward-thinking dude
if there ever was one.

07:56.944 --> 07:59.679
It was built in 1798.

07:59.680 --> 08:00.713
How long in the family?

08:00.714 --> 08:02.348
Over 75 years.

08:02.349 --> 08:03.783
My father during that time, he

08:03.784 --> 08:06.352
had Billy holiday appeared, he

08:06.353 --> 08:10.757
had Cy Moan, El Fanlts,
all the big names, jazz.

08:10.758 --> 08:12.024
How has town changed?

08:12.025 --> 08:12.893
Has it changed?

08:12.894 --> 08:14.193
I think tremendously.

08:14.194 --> 08:16.696
Gay lifestyle is
much more accepted.

08:16.697 --> 08:21.267
Okay, 1972, my feeling was
that this was a gay town and

08:21.268 --> 08:24.303
that I was here at the pleasure

08:24.304 --> 08:25.572
of, you know, somebody else.

08:25.573 --> 08:27.273
Which is sort of the opposite of

08:27.274 --> 08:28.808
everywhere outside of
here at that time.

08:28.809 --> 08:29.909
Oh yes.

08:29.910 --> 08:35.114
This was largely catholic,
Portuguese, conservative

08:35.115 --> 08:37.616
community, but it was
also known as hell town.

08:37.618 --> 08:40.219
Hell town, there's where the

08:40.220 --> 08:43.823
pure tins sent their rejects.

08:43.823 --> 08:44.957
Yeah.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.594
Provincetown had the mixture

08:47.595 --> 08:49.395
really of the bohemian people

08:49.396 --> 08:53.566
and the fishermen, pirates,
writers, drunks, all that.

08:53.567 --> 08:56.335
The lifestyle outside of
mainstream was welcome here

08:56.336 --> 08:56.770
pretty much.

08:56.771 --> 08:58.470
Whatever floats your boat.

08:58.471 --> 08:58.839
You know.

08:58.840 --> 09:01.641
It's all good.

09:01.642 --> 09:05.713
♪

09:20.093 --> 09:24.163
Over a century ago,
Provincetown was a hard working

09:24.164 --> 09:28.935
fishing village with
multigenerational families of

09:28.936 --> 09:29.469
fishermen.

09:29.470 --> 09:32.772
My name's Bo Gribbon.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.874
My father fished, and I was

09:34.875 --> 09:37.810
pretty much raised
here my whole life.

09:37.811 --> 09:38.878
Where I'm from.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.713
This is who I am.

09:40.714 --> 09:43.215
But it used to be like two out

09:43.216 --> 09:45.351
of three families in this town,

09:45.352 --> 09:47.286
this community, were
fishing families.

09:47.287 --> 09:48.721
Most of them are now gone.

09:48.722 --> 09:51.624
And we're really
like a minority.

09:51.625 --> 09:54.526
Used to be a fishing community

09:54.527 --> 09:57.296
with a homo sexual problem.

09:57.297 --> 10:00.967
The first Portuguese fishermen
arrived here in 1840.

10:00.968 --> 10:02.669
The main families created a

10:02.670 --> 10:03.870
community built around fishing,

10:03.871 --> 10:05.905
and this town lived off that

10:05.906 --> 10:09.241
industry well into
the 20th century.

10:09.242 --> 10:11.844
It persisted even when I was

10:11.845 --> 10:13.579
here, keeping up the
blessing of the fleet.

10:13.580 --> 10:15.181
These days however, there are

10:15.182 --> 10:19.218
fewer and fewer boats to bless.

10:19.219 --> 10:27.193
My name's Scott roe, I'm a
commercial fishermen, fourth

10:27.194 --> 10:27.494
generation.

10:27.495 --> 10:30.562
It was cool back then,
started when I was five.

10:30.563 --> 10:32.699
70 and 80 boats here, five or

10:32.700 --> 10:34.566
six feet now, now it's just down

10:34.567 --> 10:36.268
to like seven or eight.

cowboy, like a pioneer, you

11:37.831 --> 11:39.631
could go out, and as hard as you

11:39.632 --> 11:42.401
could push, competition
was welcomed.

11:42.402 --> 11:43.836
We were fiercely independent.

Independence is like little by

9,000, take away 3,000 for the

blowing like 30, 35.

expecting to see.

seen as a poor people problem,
somebody else's problem.

31:03.429 --> 31:06.331
The drug problem has
gotten rampant.

31:06.332 --> 31:10.068
Took over may 1st, 2012, I
was broken into four times.

31:10.069 --> 31:11.636
It wasn't just me, it was

31:11.637 --> 31:13.104
multiple businesses
time after time.

31:13.105 --> 31:14.906
I came in one morning to open

31:14.907 --> 31:17.075
up, and I had a guy in front of

31:17.076 --> 31:20.745
the rebel star and he got
up, pulled a knife out.

31:20.746 --> 31:22.013
I realized it really wasn't

31:22.014 --> 31:23.314
worth anything over a knife.

31:23.315 --> 31:24.849
What you're doing
here is terrific.

31:24.850 --> 31:28.954
A man can go and get a pot open

31:28.955 --> 31:29.688
Turkey sandwich and good slice

31:29.689 --> 31:31.924
of pie, it's a beautiful thing.

31:54.480 --> 31:59.650
My name is Heather Taylor.

31:59.651 --> 32:03.488
I'm a mother of three.

32:03.489 --> 32:09.995
The two older kids
experienced my addiction.

32:09.996 --> 32:12.363
My addiction started with pills.

32:12.364 --> 32:14.065
I started sniffing heroin.

32:14.066 --> 32:17.002
I shot up for the first time,

32:17.003 --> 32:20.838
and shortly there later I
found out I was pregnant.

32:20.839 --> 32:22.207
I had my daughter.

32:22.208 --> 32:23.708
She was in the hospital for six

32:23.709 --> 32:26.311
weeks because she was addicted

32:26.312 --> 32:31.349
to the methadone and I had
to watch my baby go through

32:31.350 --> 32:31.917
withdraws.

32:31.918 --> 32:34.885
My son was four, and my daughter

32:34.886 --> 32:37.522
was six weeks when
they were taken away.

32:37.523 --> 32:44.029
I lost my kids for 33
days shy of two years.

32:44.030 --> 32:49.234
I became serious
about my recovery.

32:49.235 --> 32:53.438
So is this the bad part of
town or is this just a place

32:53.439 --> 32:56.607
where you're unlikely
for people to find you.

32:56.608 --> 32:59.677
Just a place where people
are unlikely to find you.

32:59.678 --> 33:01.246
I wouldn't necessarily say there

33:01.247 --> 33:04.915
was a bad part of greenfield.

33:04.916 --> 33:08.419
I mean, it's probably pretty

33:08.420 --> 33:11.356
spread out, bad, I
guess you'd say.

33:11.357 --> 33:12.224
What would you do?

33:12.225 --> 33:13.258
Come here to shoot up?

33:13.259 --> 33:13.959
Yep.

33:13.960 --> 33:15.893
You know we'd go down here and

33:15.894 --> 33:16.927
just hang out down there.

33:16.928 --> 33:19.897
I bet if we walked along here,

33:19.898 --> 33:21.466
we'd find needles and bags.

33:21.467 --> 33:22.401
You know.

33:22.402 --> 33:23.901
Basically you'd come down

33:23.902 --> 33:27.238
here, shoot up, and what
are you going to nod out?

33:27.239 --> 33:30.208
Just sit down... just
sit down and hang out.

33:30.209 --> 33:32.977
A day like this, hang out under

33:32.978 --> 33:34.212
the underpass over there.

33:34.213 --> 33:37.815
Not exactly la vida loca.

33:37.816 --> 33:39.650
As you can see the trash and

33:39.651 --> 33:41.586
yuck, it's dirty and gross.

33:41.587 --> 33:46.091
There's probably people
who live down here.

33:46.092 --> 33:46.792
Really?

33:46.793 --> 33:52.397
Yeah, there's a lot of
homeless people in greenfield.

33:52.398 --> 33:53.898
What do you think now when

33:53.899 --> 33:56.401
you see somebody who's
junk sick on the street?

33:56.402 --> 33:58.836
It gives me that
yuck, sick feeling.

33:58.837 --> 33:59.937
And it scares me.

33:59.938 --> 34:02.973
It reminds me why I don't
want to be out there.

34:02.974 --> 34:03.909
It's just scary.

34:03.910 --> 34:08.779
A friend of mine overdosed
January 1st of this year.

34:08.780 --> 34:10.148
And my brother-in-law overdosed

34:10.149 --> 34:12.449
in Wendy's bathroom
and they found him.

34:12.451 --> 34:14.152
And they brought
him back to life.

34:14.152 --> 34:15.253
He was dead in the bathroom.

34:15.254 --> 34:19.257
Uh-huh.

34:19.257 --> 34:22.659
So this is my narc cam.

34:22.661 --> 34:24.161
I carry this around, I have one

34:24.163 --> 34:28.299
of these in my house and
I have one in my car.

34:28.300 --> 34:29.800
I have a fear that my husband's

34:29.801 --> 34:32.270
going to relapse and I'm
going to find him dead.

34:32.271 --> 34:35.806
You just put this in here and
squirt it up their nose.

34:35.806 --> 34:37.475
Now in most cases, as I

34:37.476 --> 34:39.310
understand it, they're
right out of it.

34:39.311 --> 34:44.681
They're right out of
it and instantly sick.

34:44.683 --> 34:45.284
They don't wake up happy.

34:45.284 --> 34:46.152
But they wake up.

34:46.152 --> 34:47.217
Somebody's blue there.

34:47.219 --> 34:47.985
On the floor.

34:47.987 --> 34:49.454
Are you saving that life?

34:49.455 --> 34:51.289
Yep, saving that life.

34:51.290 --> 34:51.590
Absolutely.

34:51.591 --> 34:54.293
And then kicking
their [ bleep ].

34:58.664 --> 34:59.331
Better now?

34:59.331 --> 35:00.065
Life better now?

35:00.066 --> 35:01.999
Absolutely.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.568
My kids have been
home three years.

35:03.569 --> 35:05.903
You know, I no longer
have to watch my back.

35:05.904 --> 35:11.242
You know, I live a pretty
straight and narrow life.

35:11.243 --> 35:12.243
Which, you know, people might

35:12.244 --> 35:14.479
say is boring, but I
love my life today.

35:14.480 --> 35:15.314
I'm grateful.

35:15.315 --> 35:16.647
Where are we headed?

35:16.648 --> 35:17.648
This way.

35:17.649 --> 35:19.016
Oh, okay.

35:19.017 --> 35:20.651
To the recover projects.

35:20.652 --> 35:24.255
This is where my
recovery started.

35:24.256 --> 35:26.557
Started near lay decade ago

35:26.558 --> 35:27.925
in one of the two main streets

35:27.926 --> 35:32.863
of greenfield, the recover
project is community-based.

35:32.864 --> 35:34.332
An open arms program aimed at

35:34.333 --> 35:36.601
helping addicts stay clean.

35:36.602 --> 35:42.240
Given the opioid heroin

35:42.241 --> 35:43.408
addiction in our community, we'd

35:43.409 --> 35:45.743
like to start the conversation.

35:45.744 --> 35:46.877
What happened at that point of

35:46.878 --> 35:48.112
our life, what that was like.

35:48.113 --> 35:50.715
So as a child growing up in a

35:50.716 --> 35:53.784
home of addiction, I didn't

35:53.785 --> 35:55.253
understand how they could do all

35:55.254 --> 35:57.087
the stuff that they did to me

35:57.088 --> 35:58.289
and my brother and sister.

35:58.290 --> 35:59.724
Like don't you love me enough?

35:59.725 --> 36:01.892
Then I became a mother, and then

36:01.893 --> 36:03.594
I became a heroin addict.

36:03.595 --> 36:09.467
And I did all that
stuff to my kids.

36:09.468 --> 36:10.369
My doctor was my
biggest drug dealer.

36:10.370 --> 36:12.737
Married, had a baby, fell
down the stairs, two jobs,

36:12.738 --> 36:14.038
college on top of it.

36:14.039 --> 36:15.440
Next thing I know I'm on the

36:15.441 --> 36:17.242
prescriptions, that's where
it all began for me.

36:17.243 --> 36:20.077
What are the odds you're
going to own a house?

36:20.078 --> 36:21.879
What's the odds to
have a nice car?

36:21.880 --> 36:22.414
Any car?

36:22.415 --> 36:25.082
A place to live, all that stuff?

36:25.083 --> 36:29.554
Seems less and less
likely all the time.

36:29.555 --> 36:32.723
When you stick a spike in
your arm and I wouldn't.

36:32.724 --> 36:35.159
So I have this picture in my

36:35.160 --> 36:36.994
head which got the phone call my

36:36.995 --> 36:38.329
daughter's father had been in

36:38.330 --> 36:40.998
the accident and I just had a

36:40.999 --> 36:43.000
c-section and come in with this

36:43.001 --> 36:44.802
need toll give me at Van and all

36:44.803 --> 36:47.972
I needed was a hug, like I just

36:47.973 --> 36:49.507
needed someone to give me a hug,

36:49.508 --> 36:51.476
I care about you, Kaitlyn, and

36:51.477 --> 36:53.244
everything is going to be okay.

36:53.245 --> 36:58.082
I'll tell you something
really shameful about myself.

36:58.083 --> 37:03.621
The first time I shot up I
looked at myself with a big

37:03.622 --> 37:03.922
grin.

37:03.923 --> 37:08.092
Something was missing in me
whether it was a self-image

37:08.093 --> 37:11.362
situation, whether it was a

37:11.363 --> 37:14.198
character flaw, stable family,

37:14.199 --> 37:16.467
the suburbs, I had a lot of

37:16.468 --> 37:19.136
advantages, there was some dark

37:19.137 --> 37:21.205
genie inside me that I hesitate

37:21.206 --> 37:23.308
to call a disease that led me to

37:23.309 --> 37:25.610
dope, you know, I didn't have

37:25.611 --> 37:29.647
anyone else who could have
talked me out of what I was

37:29.648 --> 37:32.182
doing, but intervention
wouldn't have worked.

37:32.183 --> 37:35.653
I didn't have a child, I have a

37:35.654 --> 37:37.655
7-year-old daughter now who
I never would have had.

37:37.656 --> 37:39.857
I never would have thought... I

37:39.858 --> 37:42.660
looked in a mirror and I saw

37:42.661 --> 37:45.363
somebody worth saving or that I

37:45.364 --> 37:47.998
wanted to at least try
real hard and save.

37:47.999 --> 37:53.504
You know, anybody can find
themself very easily in this

37:53.505 --> 37:55.072
situation and, you know, I look

37:55.073 --> 37:57.007
back on that and I think about

37:57.008 --> 37:59.577
what I'll tell my
daughter, you know.

37:59.578 --> 38:02.079
You know, that was daddy.

38:02.080 --> 38:03.714
Ain't no doubt about it but I

38:03.715 --> 38:06.517
hope I'll be able to say
that was daddy then.

38:06.518 --> 38:09.887
This is daddy now that I'm
alive and living in hope.

38:09.888 --> 38:10.188
Thank you.

38:10.856 --> 38:14.493
Good.

38:25.203 --> 38:27.405
♪

38:27.406 --> 38:30.841
In Massachusetts the clambake
is a ritual going back

38:30.842 --> 38:33.277
to the Flintstones, before the

38:33.278 --> 38:34.845
pilgrims, today at the long

38:34.846 --> 38:36.714
standing locals only shooting

38:36.715 --> 38:41.218
club, shoots and Veren in German

38:41.219 --> 38:44.054
for the immigrants who started

38:44.055 --> 38:45.556
this ray takes me through the

38:45.557 --> 38:47.057
fascinating and arcane process

38:47.058 --> 38:50.561
of creating an
old-school clambake.

38:50.562 --> 38:55.866
Basically we build a kiln
with hardwood and stone.

38:55.867 --> 38:58.235
We burn it down, remove the wood

38:58.236 --> 39:01.271
and cover it with seaweed and

39:01.272 --> 39:03.207
corn hunks and we put our clams

39:03.208 --> 39:06.544
and lobsters and corn in there
like a pressure cooker.

39:06.545 --> 39:08.913
We've got a pig
hiding in there also.

39:08.914 --> 39:10.247
No, no, no.

39:10.248 --> 39:14.619
We'll pull a tusker out and

39:14.620 --> 39:15.620
you'll see what we have here.

39:15.621 --> 39:16.321
Let's eat.

39:16.322 --> 39:18.924
All right.

39:19.257 --> 39:20.758
First some good chowder and

39:20.759 --> 39:23.227
there really is only one kind of

39:23.228 --> 39:26.263
chowder, new England
clam chowder.

39:26.264 --> 39:27.432
Mm-mm.

39:27.433 --> 39:31.802
That is good.

39:31.803 --> 39:37.808
Steamer clams, lobster,
corn, Potatoes.

39:37.809 --> 39:44.615
Pretty luxurious clambake here.

39:44.616 --> 39:45.451
That was amazing.

39:45.452 --> 39:47.652
Absolutely.

39:47.653 --> 39:50.788
Everybody's attention
for a second.

39:50.789 --> 39:53.290
The awareness task force came

39:53.291 --> 39:54.625
together several months ago.

39:54.626 --> 39:56.961
I don't think we realized how

39:56.962 --> 40:00.197
quickly this could turn
into a cite cyst for us.

40:00.198 --> 40:03.333
Everybody in the room has
been impacted by narcotics in

40:03.334 --> 40:06.336
some way, the opiod task force

40:06.337 --> 40:08.473
is a grassroots response.

40:08.474 --> 40:10.307
Doctor, law enforcement led by

40:10.308 --> 40:12.677
Franklin county sheriff Chris

40:12.678 --> 40:15.980
Donilon, addiction specialist

40:15.981 --> 40:19.817
and addicteds themselves are
coming together to find a

40:19.818 --> 40:20.652
community-based solution to what

40:20.653 --> 40:22.553
is a public health crisis rather

40:22.554 --> 40:23.821
than a criminal justice problem.

40:23.822 --> 40:25.022
A great opportunity to come

40:25.023 --> 40:27.458
here tonight to break bread and

40:27.459 --> 40:28.393
look at the successes that we

40:28.394 --> 40:31.529
have had so far, think what
makes me more proud than

40:31.530 --> 40:32.997
anything else about living in

40:32.998 --> 40:34.999
Franklin county is that we will

40:35.000 --> 40:37.902
not sit back and wait for
anybody else to solve this

40:37.903 --> 40:39.336
problem for us.

40:39.337 --> 40:41.371
We'll be a model for the
commonwealth and nation on how

40:41.372 --> 40:43.252
we save our young people
and save our community.

40:47.546 --> 40:50.314
The city is the place where

40:50.315 --> 40:53.551
all the bad stuff is supposed to

40:53.552 --> 40:55.986
happen, not nice towns
like greenfield.

40:55.987 --> 40:57.354
It isn't the image that people

40:57.355 --> 41:00.925
had 20 years ago, a junkie
in an alley using a needle.

41:00.926 --> 41:01.727
It's not.

41:01.728 --> 41:03.227
It's your kids, your neighbors.

41:03.228 --> 41:04.929
The worst I think is when you

41:04.930 --> 41:06.931
have these young people who

41:06.932 --> 41:08.365
break a leg and they go to the

41:08.366 --> 41:09.867
doctor and get a prescription

41:09.868 --> 41:12.670
for oxy and become
addicted to it.

41:12.671 --> 41:19.376
These are any kid who plays
a high school sport.

41:19.377 --> 41:20.845
Heroin was around, pills were

41:20.846 --> 41:22.713
around but we didn't
have people dying.

41:22.714 --> 41:25.783
Once you've been busted for

41:25.784 --> 41:29.086
heroin, that's a hard
thing to live down.

41:29.087 --> 41:31.856
Got to get rid of that shame

41:31.857 --> 41:33.891
factor to deal with
it address it.

41:33.892 --> 41:36.594
Get support from the community.

41:36.595 --> 41:41.398
I feel like we'll lose a
generation, 18 to 22, the

41:41.399 --> 41:42.700
district attorney, the police

41:42.701 --> 41:46.403
department are all united this.

41:46.404 --> 41:52.309
Task force is home to a
matter of a hundred people.

41:52.310 --> 41:55.913
I lost one daughter to drugs.

41:55.914 --> 41:59.884
You know, whatever it takes.

41:59.885 --> 42:02.620
Let's start by being
honest with ourselves.

42:02.621 --> 42:05.455
As a nation for decades we were

42:05.456 --> 42:08.826
perfectly happy to write off
whole neighborhoods, whole

42:08.827 --> 42:11.428
cities, whole generations
of young men and women.

42:11.429 --> 42:13.798
As long as it was an inner city

42:13.799 --> 42:15.265
problem, an urban problem which

42:15.266 --> 42:18.468
is to say a black people

42:18.469 --> 42:20.270
problem, a brown people problem,

42:20.271 --> 42:22.272
send them to prison into a

42:22.273 --> 42:24.909
system from which
they'll never maybe.

42:24.910 --> 42:26.310
Maybe now that it's come home to

42:26.311 --> 42:30.347
roost and the high school
quarterback, your next-door

42:30.348 --> 42:33.751
neighbor, your son, your
daughter, now that grandma is

42:33.752 --> 42:35.786
likely to be a junkie as anyone

42:35.787 --> 42:37.688
else we'll accept there's never

42:37.689 --> 42:39.590
been a real war on drugs.

42:39.591 --> 42:41.659
War on drugs implies an us

42:41.660 --> 42:43.127
versus them and all over this

42:43.128 --> 42:46.163
part of America, people are
learns there is no them.

42:46.164 --> 42:47.965
There is only us.

42:47.966 --> 42:50.936
And we're going to have to
figure this out together.
