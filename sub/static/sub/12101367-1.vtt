I've been tracking the
four recent shark attacks

isn't adding up.

31:17.013 --> 31:18.290
- Well, detectives seem to think

31:18.290 --> 31:19.739
it's the work of a
single rouge shark

but I'm not sure about that.

31:21.983 --> 31:22.881
Do you have a map?

31:33.408 --> 31:36.342
Now the first attack was
a few days ago in Tijuana.

31:36.342 --> 31:38.482
Following that, in Newport Beach

31:38.482 --> 31:41.244
and then just yesterday,
another one in Long Beach.

31:41.244 --> 31:42.486

31:43.694 --> 31:45.800
- I don't think
there's just one shark.

31:45.800 --> 31:47.181

distance for any fish

31:47.181 --> 31:49.148
to travel with no clear path.

31:50.011 --> 31:51.702
- He has a point.

31:51.702 --> 31:54.602
- But why would several
sharks be attacking at once?

- I don't know, that's
why I need your help.

31:55.948 --> 31:58.917

be possible that,

31:58.917 --> 32:03.162
that for some reason they're
forming a mob mentality

32:03.162 --> 32:05.751
and attacking in various
places all at once?

32:06.890 --> 32:09.997
- Sharks can't process
thoughts that way.

32:09.997 --> 32:13.241
However, some experts
believe they possess ESP

32:13.241 --> 32:15.450
and can use it to
communicate with each other

32:15.450 --> 32:16.935
over vast distances.

32:18.074 --> 32:19.730
- Dogs and cats
do it all the time

32:19.730 --> 32:22.250

32:23.942 --> 32:26.289

Fluffy during a move

32:26.289 --> 32:27.911
and it showed up to her new home

32:27.911 --> 32:30.879

like a week later.

32:34.193 --> 32:35.125
It's true.

32:37.472 --> 32:39.958
- If you have any evidence
from that attacks,

32:39.958 --> 32:41.442
we could try running some tests

32:41.442 --> 32:44.100

matches between victims.

that can be possible
