(GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING)

30:20.610 --> 30:23.238
Let me bring us around. Good.

30:24.155 --> 30:26.074
This moment deserves a toast.

30:27.116 --> 30:30.495
Keep it in, keep it in, keep it pushing.
Push it in. Push it in.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.872
-DWAYNE: I'm getting it in.
-Keep going. Keep going.

30:33.414 --> 30:36.960
-WILL: (LAUGHS) Yeah. That'll do it.
-DWAYNE: Perfect.

30:40.547 --> 30:44.175
When I first got out here,
everything seemed unknowable.

30:44.759 --> 30:45.802
Dangerous even.

30:46.678 --> 30:50.056
Now, I understand
there's a logic to everything.

30:51.391 --> 30:56.479
<i>I never imagined myself</i>
<i>being capable of this. But I did it.</i>

30:57.313 --> 31:00.942
<i>Me, the kid from West Philly</i>
<i>who hates water.</i>

31:01.776 --> 31:04.279
<i>And we made it all the way to the ocean.</i>

31:04.445 --> 31:05.613
We've arrived.

31:05.864 --> 31:10.368
<i>I know it doesn't sound like a big thing,</i>
<i>to be able to find an ocean.</i>

31:11.119 --> 31:12.537
<i>But for me, that was big.</i>

31:13.788 --> 31:14.914
You didn't kill me.

31:15.290 --> 31:18.418
-You didn't kill me! (LAUGHS)
-(LAUGHS)

31:18.543 --> 31:20.253
-Almost. (GRUNTS)
-(GRUNTS)

31:23.047 --> 31:26.134
Now, I can see
what it means to go with the flow.

31:26.301 --> 31:28.261
DWAYNE: Do you know what,
that's such a nice way to put it.

31:30.054 --> 31:32.140
Wow. Look at this place.

31:33.808 --> 31:34.934
(GROANS)

31:36.185 --> 31:38.146
DWAYNE: I'm telling you,
that was something, wasn't it?

31:38.313 --> 31:40.315
-Dude.
-(DWAYNE GRUNTS)

31:40.773 --> 31:45.403
I'm just happy to, like, be here,
and have survived.

31:45.486 --> 31:48.364
Yeah. There were moments
where I thought, "Ooh! We're going in."

31:48.531 --> 31:50.158
-(LAUGHS)
-DWAYNE: But we didn't. We didn't!

31:50.283 --> 31:53.036
For me, it's just coming out here
and being at one with nature,

31:53.119 --> 31:54.871
-and testing myself, and proving myself.
-WILL: Mm-hmm.

31:54.954 --> 31:58.166
And it's not about, "Look at me.
Look how strong, and great, and powerful."

31:58.291 --> 32:00.793
It's about, "Can I apply
what I've experienced here

32:00.877 --> 32:02.170
"to another challenge in my life?"

32:02.253 --> 32:04.339
-Yeah, yeah.
-For me, it's just about that experience.

32:04.464 --> 32:06.841
You know, when you start
these kinds of things,

32:07.008 --> 32:09.260
you never quite know
if you're gonna get to the end.

32:09.344 --> 32:11.054
I don't know, maybe you know
you can get to the end.

32:11.471 --> 32:13.348
-I believe I'll always get to the end.
-Really?

32:13.431 --> 32:16.392
Um, and for me,
it's not even about the end.

32:16.476 --> 32:18.645
It's about... it's...
I know it sounds so cliché, innit,

32:18.728 --> 32:19.854
-it's the journey that counts.
-WILL: Hmm.

32:19.938 --> 32:23.066
But honestly, for me, it's the doing it,
it's the experiencing it.

32:23.149 --> 32:26.361
It's about being out there.
You can't tell me that this right now

32:26.444 --> 32:27.820
is the best part of the journey
we've just done.

32:27.904 --> 32:29.530
That... now, that's very true.

32:30.573 --> 32:33.451
You know what?
Even now that you mention that...

32:33.534 --> 32:37.914
-DWAYNE: Yeah.
-...arriving even has a little bittersweet

32:37.997 --> 32:39.499
-kind of thing.
-DWAYNE: Yeah, it's like an anticlimax.

32:39.582 --> 32:41.542
-Yeah, yeah. (LAUGHS)
-DWAYNE: Yeah.

32:41.668 --> 32:44.671
-That is true. That's true.
-Hold on. What's that?

<i>This has been a long,</i>
<i>tough journey for me.</i>

32:57.934 --> 33:01.688
But in a way, it's taken me 52 years.

<i>My mission at the start</i>
<i>of this journey was simple.</i>

33:08.152 --> 33:11.823

<i>It can be terrifying</i>
<i>to step out into those unknowns.</i>

33:42.395 --> 33:47.108
But sometimes, the only thing to do
is to give yourself over to the flow.

33:48.818 --> 33:50.903
<i>Let go of your fears.</i>

33:53.781 --> 33:58.327
