00:34.750 --> 00:37.849
There are some seas where
fish swarm in millions...

00:40.751 --> 00:44.750
and plankton blossoms
in vast clouds.

00:47.751 --> 00:51.751
The sheer quantity of life here
is unmatched anywhere in the oceans.

00:59.753 --> 01:03.752
These are the most productive
seas on earth.

01:08.754 --> 01:12.753
They are the Seasonal Seas.

01:15.754 --> 01:18.754
The Seasonal Seas border the
Temperate parts of the world,

01:18.755 --> 01:22.754
where conditions change
through the year.

01:29.756 --> 01:33.755
The seasons also affect
the underwater world.

01:35.756 --> 01:39.756
The power of the sun
is constantly changing.

01:42.757 --> 01:46.756
In the far north during the Summer
there are long hours of sunlight,

01:47.757 --> 01:51.757
but in Winter that dwindles and
eventually there can be weeks of darkness.

01:54.758 --> 01:58.757
The summers are warm and gentle,
the winters racked by savage storms.

02:54.764 --> 02:58.763
In conditions like this life of
any sort has to struggle to survive

03:04.765 --> 03:08.764
January on Sable Island off the
coast of Nova Scotia in North America.

03:10.766 --> 03:14.765
Grey Seals have managed to get ashore
through the crashing breakers.

03:23.767 --> 03:27.766
Gales here can blow for days on end.

03:46.769 --> 03:50.769
Sable Island has the world's largest
colony of grey seals

03:50.770 --> 03:54.769
100,000 come here to breed each year,
just when the weather is at its worst.

04:02.771 --> 04:05.770
To add insult to injury, the pups,

04:05.771 --> 04:09.771
having suckled for only 18 days
are then abandoned.

04:09.772 --> 04:13.771
Their mothers must return to the
sea to find food for themselves.

04:18.773 --> 04:21.772
As yet unable to dive,
the pups are marooned

04:21.773 --> 04:25.772
and sustained by nothing
except their fatty blubber.

04:27.773 --> 04:31.773
It will be five weeks before
they are strong enough to swim,

04:31.774 --> 04:35.773
but by then it will be early spring
and the ocean will be teeming with food.

04:51.776 --> 04:55.775
By May, Spring has reached
the coasts of Scotland.

04:59.777 --> 05:02.776
Underwater it arrived rather earlier.

05:02.777 --> 05:06.776
During March, the seas had warmed enough
to trigger a magical transformation.

05:20.779 --> 05:24.778
These are Phytoplankton,
tiny floating algae,

05:24.779 --> 05:26.778
each much smaller than a pinhead.

05:26.779 --> 05:30.779
And they multiply with amazing speed
to produce more annual growth

05:31.780 --> 05:35.779
than all the plants on land put together.
6 billion tonnes of it.

05:39.781 --> 05:43.780
This immense bloom spreads across
the face of the ocean

05:43.781 --> 05:47.780
and within a couple of months turns
vast areas of it a dense green.

05:53.782 --> 05:57.781
Animal life reacts to
the blooming sea.

05:57.782 --> 05:59.782
Although these polyps look
like small anemones,

05:59.783 --> 06:02.782
They're about to change
into something else.

06:02.783 --> 06:06.782
As they separate, they reveal
themselves to be tiny, common jellyfish.

06:11.784 --> 06:15.783
They are less than
3 millimetres across.

06:18.785 --> 06:22.784
Within a few months they will
have assembled into vast swarms.

06:28.786 --> 06:31.785
Minute copepods are part
of their staple diet.

06:31.786 --> 06:35.785
These appear every spring in vast numbers
and graze on the Phytoplankton bloom.

06:41.787 --> 06:45.786
Their beating legs create currents
that sweep the little algae

06:45.787 --> 06:49.787
into the basket-like filters
around their mouths.

06:52.788 --> 06:56.787
On this microscopic scale,
water is so viscous that

06:56.788 --> 07:00.788
the Phytoplankton can't swim
against the current.

07:03.789 --> 07:07.788
Whilst feeding, sensors on the copepod's
antennae give warning of dangers ahead.

07:13.790 --> 07:17.789
Lighting by lasers reveals that feeding
copepods leave wakes behind them,

07:18.791 --> 07:22.790
rather like jet trails in the sky.

07:40.793 --> 07:42.792
Slightly larger floating predators

07:42.793 --> 07:46.792
are able to use these trails
to find their prey.

08:00.795 --> 08:04.794
A close call - but some predators
are simply too large to avoid.

08:13.796 --> 08:17.795
Jellyfish!

08:18.797 --> 08:22.796
They may appear to be delicate as well as
beautiful, but they are deadly hunters.

09:02.801 --> 09:06.800
With every pulse of the delicate
bells plankton-rich water

09:06.801 --> 09:10.801
is drawn into their lacy throats
and pushed out again,

09:10.802 --> 09:14.801
leaving behind copepods stuck
to the membranes.

09:22.803 --> 09:26.802
A single sea-nettle jellyfish
only a few centimetres

09:26.803 --> 09:30.803
across can collect thousands
of copepods in a day.

09:42.805 --> 09:46.804
So the killing power of giants
like these is hard to estimate.

09:53.806 --> 09:56.805
Each of these jellyfish
weighs up to 30 kilos

09:56.806 --> 10:00.806
and has tentacles stretching
over 8 metres.

10:03.807 --> 10:07.806
But there are even greater dangers
awaiting the copepods.

10:09.808 --> 10:13.807
By the late spring the baby common
jellyfish are fully grown.

10:15.808 --> 10:19.808
They gather in millions, forming
immense swarms hundreds of metres long,

10:20.809 --> 10:24.808
which filter out all the small
planktonic animals in their path.

11:13.814 --> 11:16.813
Nevertheless, there are such
astronomic numbers of copepods

11:16.814 --> 11:20.814
that enough will survive to
form swarms of their own.

11:36.816 --> 11:40.816
A basking shark.

11:40.817 --> 11:44.816
This huge eight tonne fish feeds
on plankton and nothing else.

11:47.817 --> 11:51.817
Every hour it filters a thousand
tonnes of seawater through its gills.

11:56.818 --> 11:59.818
Numbers of these shark appear when
the bloom is at its peak

11:59.819 --> 12:03.818
and travel along those water currents
where the plankton is thickest.

12:07.819 --> 12:10.819
Even so, the supply of plankton
is so abundant

12:10.820 --> 12:13.819
that another group of animals'
is able to share in the feast

12:13.820 --> 12:17.819
animals that live on the seafloor.

12:21.821 --> 12:25.820
Every centimetre of rock is covered
with invertebrates of some kind

12:26.821 --> 12:29.821
anemones, sea squirts,
Gorgonians,

12:29.822 --> 12:33.821
all trapping plankton from
the passing water.

13:14.826 --> 13:18.825
Not all life in the Seasonal
Seas depends upon the plankton.

13:20.827 --> 13:22.826
It's early spring in
British Columbia.

13:22.827 --> 13:26.826
Seaweed has started to grow
slowly in the cold water.

13:28.828 --> 13:32.827
As the hours of sunlight
increase and the water warms,

13:32.828 --> 13:36.827
these small plants turn
into great beds of bull kelp.

13:47.829 --> 13:51.829
The immense 30 metre long strands
have small gas filled floats

13:51.830 --> 13:55.829
which keep them high in the water within
reach of the energy-giving sunlight.

14:06.831 --> 14:09.831
Further south the sunshine
is more powerful,

14:09.832 --> 14:13.831
so here, on the coast of California,
the biggest kelp of all can grow.

14:18.833 --> 14:22.832
This is giant kelp and
by midsummer each plant

14:22.833 --> 14:26.832
is growing in length by
nearly a metre a day.

14:34.834 --> 14:38.834
The main stem is fixed to
the bottom 35 metres below

14:38.835 --> 14:42.834
by a small but immensely
strong holdfast.

14:46.835 --> 14:50.835
Fully grown, these gigantic plants
are a hundred metres long

14:50.836 --> 14:54.835
and they form vast marine forests.

14:55.836 --> 14:59.836
Great schools of fish find
sanctuary here.

15:05.837 --> 15:09.837
These are blacksmith fish.

15:09.838 --> 15:12.837
They are plankton feeders
and whenever it seems safe

15:12.838 --> 15:16.837
they head off into open water to
feed where the plankton is thickest.

15:21.839 --> 15:25.838
But at the first hint of danger...

15:25.839 --> 15:29.839
...they rush back to the
safety of the forest.

15:33.840 --> 15:37.839
Fish are not the only
creatures that shelter here

15:42.841 --> 15:46.840
Californian sea otters gather in the kelp
forest to rest and snooze in safety.

15:52.842 --> 15:56.841
To prevent themselves being carried
away into dangerous open water,

15:56.842 --> 15:58.842
where the big predators cruise,

15:58.843 --> 16:02.842
they anchor themselves by winding
straps of kelp around their body.

16:09.844 --> 16:12.843
Sooner or later,
they have to find food

16:12.844 --> 16:16.843
and that lies on the seabed
a long way below them.

16:16.844 --> 16:18.844
Sea otters, however,
can stay underwater for

16:18.845 --> 16:22.844
up to 10 minutes and that's ample time
to find the shellfish they need.

16:54.848 --> 16:58.847
Many of the smaller creatures that live
in these forests, such as urchins,

16:59.849 --> 17:03.848
graze on the kelp and can seriously damage
it if their numbers are unchecked.

17:04.848 --> 17:07.848
The sea otters, however,
feed on some of these grazers

17:07.848 --> 17:11.749
and prevent them getting
too numerous.

17:11.750 --> 17:14.848
So, in effect, the Sea Otters
are the guardians of the forest.

17:20.751 --> 17:24.750
Garibaldi fish do not,
in fact, damage the kelp.

17:24.751 --> 17:27.750
If anything, they help it
by picking off tiny animals

17:27.751 --> 17:31.751
that in places encrust the leaves.

17:36.752 --> 17:40.752
They graze on bryozoans,
tiny colonial animals,

17:40.753 --> 17:44.752
which build their colonies like
a patchwork of white skins on the leaves.

17:59.755 --> 18:02.754
When night falls there are fewer
predatory fish around

18:02.755 --> 18:06.754
and the bryozoans emerge from
their white shelters.

18:12.756 --> 18:16.755
Now, just like coral polyps
they start filtering out

18:16.756 --> 18:20.756
the plankton under cover of darkness.

18:23.757 --> 18:27.756
They are not the only animals
to venture out at this time.

18:33.758 --> 18:37.757
This is an amphipod, just two
centimetres long and it does eat kelp.

18:44.759 --> 18:48.758
In turn, it is excellent food
for many predators.

18:56.760 --> 19:00.760
To protect itself it produces silk,
just like a spider,

19:00.761 --> 19:04.760
and uses it to sew together two sides
of a kelp frond and so form a shelter.

19:14.762 --> 19:18.761
This one is in particular need of
a secure home. She's a mother.

19:23.763 --> 19:27.762
There are over fifty youngsters
clustered on her abdomen,

19:27.763 --> 19:31.763
so her home is becoming
somewhat cramped.

19:33.764 --> 19:37.763
They will soon be old enough to leave
and now whenever she can,

19:37.764 --> 19:41.764
she kicks them out to get a taste
of the outside world.

19:50.766 --> 19:53.765
Dawn.

19:53.766 --> 19:57.765
Beds of eel grass grow in the shallows
between the kelp forest and the shore.

20:00.767 --> 20:03.766
A harbour seal has found
sanctuary here,

20:03.767 --> 20:07.766
and is sleeping after
a hard night's foraging.

20:09.768 --> 20:13.767
But not for long.

20:15.768 --> 20:19.767
A male seal gives a wake up call.

20:22.769 --> 20:26.768
More seals are attracted
from all directions.

20:33.770 --> 20:37.769
It's June, the time when
young male harbour seals

20:37.770 --> 20:41.770
start their strange mating displays.

20:43.771 --> 20:47.770
One listens attentively to the
grunting noises made by the other.

20:52.772 --> 20:55.771
These calls are almost certainly
a way of establishing

20:55.772 --> 20:59.771
which of the two will be dominant.

21:04.773 --> 21:08.772
But if the animals are closely
matched in size and experience

21:08.773 --> 21:12.773
grunts won't settle the issue,
the rivals will have to come to blows.

21:19.775 --> 21:23.774
And seals can be surprisingly violent.

21:34.776 --> 21:36.775
In a month's time the breeding
season will start

21:36.776 --> 21:38.775
and then fights will be in earnest.

21:38.776 --> 21:42.776
But now in mid-summer these
exchanges are harmless.

21:42.777 --> 21:46.776
They're just playing.

21:50.778 --> 21:52.777
Many of the creatures that
shelter in the kelp

21:52.778 --> 21:55.777
have to venture out in order to feed.

21:55.778 --> 21:59.777
A bat ray, for one.

22:02.779 --> 22:06.778
Unlikely though it seems,
the sandy floor of the open sea is,

22:06.779 --> 22:10.779
for the bat ray, a rich feeding ground.

22:22.781 --> 22:25.780
There is food hidden within the sand

22:25.781 --> 22:29.780
and the bat ray has a special
technique for finding it.

22:35.782 --> 22:39.781
It uses jets of water to blow the sand
aside and expose small invertebrates.

22:44.783 --> 22:48.782
A kelp bass hangs about alongside,
waiting for scraps.

23:10.786 --> 23:14.785
Other hunters are also on the prowl.

23:15.786 --> 23:19.785
The fan tailed sole.

23:28.787 --> 23:32.787
There are mantid shrimps here,
living in tunnels.

23:37.788 --> 23:41.788
But once again, hunger compels
them to venture into the open.

23:41.789 --> 23:45.788
That, of course, is a gamble.

23:47.789 --> 23:50.789
They will either eat...

23:50.790 --> 23:54.789
...or be eaten.

24:00.791 --> 24:03.790
A sea slug, called Janolus.

24:03.791 --> 24:07.790
Its colours suggest that it's
poisonous and so it is,

24:07.791 --> 24:11.791
to everything except another
kind of sea slug

24:18.792 --> 24:22.792
the predatory Navanax.

24:23.793 --> 24:27.792
Navanax pulls itself along the trail of
slime that Janolus leaves behind it.

24:44.795 --> 24:48.794
Once caught, Janolus rolls
into a ball...

24:54.796 --> 24:58.795
All Navanax gets is a few
yellow tentacles.

25:02.797 --> 25:06.796
And Janolus is swept to safety
by the current.

25:14.798 --> 25:18.797
It's now mid-summer and the sun
is shining at full strength.

25:22.799 --> 25:26.798
The increasing warmth is the cue
for an Atlantic lobster

25:26.799 --> 25:28.798
to start on a long journey.

25:28.799 --> 25:32.799
She has spent the winter 250 metres down,
far beyond the reach of the storms.

25:35.800 --> 25:39.799
But it was cold down there and
now she needs to find warmer water,

25:40.801 --> 25:44.800
so she's marching towards
the shallows.

25:45.801 --> 25:49.800
They, however, are 150 kilometres away.

25:54.802 --> 25:58.801
After a month of walking she finally
arrives at her favoured sand bank.

26:02.803 --> 26:04.802
But she's not the first here.

26:04.803 --> 26:07.802
Dozens of other lobsters have already
dug themselves homes in the sand

26:07.803 --> 26:11.803
and they don't intent to
surrender them to newcomers.

26:44.807 --> 26:48.806
Size counts for everything
in these battles.

26:48.807 --> 26:52.807
The new arrival is in urgent need of a pit
and since she weighs a hefty 7 kilos,

26:54.808 --> 26:58.807
she stands a good chance
of getting one.

27:10.810 --> 27:14.809
She's won.

27:17.810 --> 27:21.810
These battles continue for the
next two months and they're crucial,

27:21.811 --> 27:23.810
for the females must
have both shelter

27:23.811 --> 27:27.810
and warm water if they're
to raise their young.

27:27.811 --> 27:31.811
For the last seven months, each of
these females has been carrying

27:31.812 --> 27:35.811
around about twenty thousand
fertilised eggs.

27:35.812 --> 27:37.811
But their task is approaching
its end.

27:37.812 --> 27:41.812
The warmth of the shallows is
speeding the eggs' development.

27:44.813 --> 27:48.812
Two more months and the eggs
are ready to hatch.

28:06.815 --> 28:10.815
At first, they're not
very good at swimming.

28:11.816 --> 28:15.815
But within a few minutes the babies
are able to set off in a purposeful way.

28:19.817 --> 28:22.816
At this time of year the sea
is full of larval animals

28:22.817 --> 28:26.816
this one is a 1 day old lobster.

28:28.817 --> 28:32.817
And this... a 3 week old crab, just
ready to start its life on the sea floor.

28:36.818 --> 28:40.818
Its feet touch the bottom
for the first time.

28:42.819 --> 28:46.818
At this stage in its life it's a
vegetarian, with a taste for sea lettuce.

28:47.819 --> 28:51.819
As it grows, so it will repeatedly moult
and expand into a bigger, thicker skin.

28:54.820 --> 28:58.819
The chances are it will be eaten,
but if it survives for five years

28:59.821 --> 29:03.820
it will have become a magnificent
armoured giant.

29:10.822 --> 29:14.821
Now it eats meat and special adaptations
enable it to hunt in the dark.

29:21.823 --> 29:24.822
Its jointed feet are
covered in sensors,

29:24.823 --> 29:28.822
which detect the slightest chemical
change in its surroundings.

29:29.824 --> 29:33.823
And as it walks through the darkness
its feet can, literally taste the sand.

29:37.824 --> 29:39.824
As soon as it finds suitable food,

29:39.825 --> 29:43.824
it passes it forward to its
powerful crushing claws,

29:43.825 --> 29:46.824
which make light work of
the soft flesh.

29:46.825 --> 29:50.825
And those claws are also
very useful for defence.

29:57.826 --> 30:01.826
A one and half metre long
common octopus glides by.

30:05.827 --> 30:09.826
The jet propelled giant is
both powerful and very clever.

30:17.828 --> 30:21.828
With octopus about, it's risky for
even a crab to be in the open.

30:23.829 --> 30:27.828
Even in the dark, the octopus's eyes
are sensitive to the slightest movement.

30:37.830 --> 30:41.830
Against a hunter like this,
the crab's claws are useless.

30:52.832 --> 30:56.831
Late summer in South East Alaska.

31:01.833 --> 31:05.832
The water is still warming and mysid
shrimp are swarming near the surface.

31:12.834 --> 31:14.833
It's a final feast for Pacific salmon,

31:14.834 --> 31:18.833
returning to the coast from
the open Pacific.

31:25.835 --> 31:29.834
They are heading inshore to breed
and they arrive in huge numbers.

31:32.836 --> 31:35.835
They have to swim far up
the rivers to spawn,

31:35.836 --> 31:38.835
but this river's level
is still too low

31:38.836 --> 31:42.836
they'll have to wait
until rain causes it to rise.

31:44.837 --> 31:47.836
So, for now they are trapped
in the sea,

31:47.837 --> 31:51.837
close to the shore,
the worst place to be.

31:53.838 --> 31:57.837
A three metre long salmon shark,
a close relation of the great white.

32:02.839 --> 32:06.838
This one has sensed minute electrical
signals from the salmon nearby.

32:09.840 --> 32:13.839
Shark can maintain their blood
temperature at a higher level

32:13.840 --> 32:16.839
than the surrounding sea water.

32:16.840 --> 32:20.840
And that means they have
the energy to be quick.

32:25.841 --> 32:29.840
Quicker even than salmon.

32:47.843 --> 32:51.843
Early autumn in Vancouver Island
in Canada, 600 miles to the south.

32:53.844 --> 32:57.843
The ocean temperature
is slowly dropping.

32:57.844 --> 32:59.844
Forty metres below the surface,

32:59.845 --> 33:03.844
this year's baby herring are feeding
on the last of the summer's plankton.

33:06.845 --> 33:10.845
Their movements attract attention
from the skies above.

33:18.846 --> 33:22.846
Gulls can't dive, so for now
the fish are still safe.

33:26.847 --> 33:30.847
But there are birds which can dive.

33:31.848 --> 33:35.847
Auklets and murres swim effortlessly
down beneath the school.

33:38.848 --> 33:42.848
The panic herring
a force towards the surface.

33:51.750 --> 33:54.849
They gather into a giant defensive
ball of swirling fish.

33:57.750 --> 34:01.750
The commotion attracts
Yellowtail rockfish.

34:03.751 --> 34:07.750
They too are hunters.

34:14.752 --> 34:18.751
The marauding fish scatter
the herring.

34:27.753 --> 34:31.753
Repeated attacks split the ball
into numerous smaller groups.

34:38.754 --> 34:41.754
Now it's easier for the divers to keep

34:41.755 --> 34:43.754
the confused fish penned
at the surface

34:43.755 --> 34:47.754
and there even the gulls
can get at them.

35:03.757 --> 35:07.756
Attacked from all sides, the little
fish have virtually no chance.

35:10.758 --> 35:14.757
More and more divers are
attracted to the scene.

35:18.758 --> 35:21.758
They harry the shrinking numbers
of herring right down

35:21.759 --> 35:25.758
to the very last individual.

35:40.761 --> 35:44.760
Far bigger predators cruise here, too.

35:45.761 --> 35:49.760
Pacific white-sided dolphin.

35:50.762 --> 35:54.761
But the dolphin are mainly
nocturnal hunters

35:54.762 --> 35:58.761
during the day they concentrate
on socialising.

35:58.762 --> 36:02.762
They display by releasing streams
of bubbles and they play games...

36:07.763 --> 36:11.763
...games like pass the seaweed,
for example.

36:43.767 --> 36:47.766
Exactly eight months ago in the
winter off the west coast of Scotland

36:48.767 --> 36:52.767
an egg was laid - and securely
fixed to a strand of kelp.

36:54.768 --> 36:58.767
Inside, a tiny embryo started
to develop.

37:06.769 --> 37:10.768
Protected by the tough egg case,
it endured the worst of the winter storms.

37:21.771 --> 37:25.770
By summer it was half grown.

37:35.772 --> 37:39.771
Now at last, in the late autumn.
It's nearly ready to hatch.

37:49.773 --> 37:52.773
A fully formed miniature
shark swims free.

37:52.774 --> 37:56.773
This year's plankton will soon die
but the young dogfish

37:56.774 --> 38:00.773
is so well developed that it can't hunt
immediately for larger prey.

38:04.775 --> 38:08.774
The days are getting shorter now.

38:08.775 --> 38:12.775
In British Columbia the
water begins to chill.

38:12.776 --> 38:16.775
This bizarre looking creature
is searching through the kelp for food.

38:18.776 --> 38:22.776
This is Melibe - the hooded sea slug.

38:26.777 --> 38:30.776
It catches plankton with
its net-like head.

38:39.778 --> 38:43.778
As winter approaches
plankton is becoming scarce,

38:43.779 --> 38:47.778
but Melibe is an assiduous searcher.

38:49.779 --> 38:53.779
It can swim.

38:56.780 --> 39:00.780
It flaps away to look for
a better feeding spot.

39:00.781 --> 39:03.780
But its search is becoming
increasingly difficult.

39:03.781 --> 39:07.780
Within the next two weeks most
of the plankton will have disappeared.

39:18.782 --> 39:20.782
As the sunlight becomes
ever more feeble

39:20.783 --> 39:24.782
the kelp starts to die,
gradually rotting away to nothing.

39:58.786 --> 40:02.786
Soon it will be winter.

40:03.787 --> 40:07.786
But 9,000 miles to the south the sun
is rising on a new spring day.

40:12.788 --> 40:15.787
The southern hemisphere too
has Temperate regions

40:15.788 --> 40:19.787
and now the plankton is
beginning to bloom around Tasmania.

40:21.789 --> 40:24.788
Just as in the north,
the Southern Seasonal Seas

40:24.789 --> 40:28.788
also have areas of
rich green water...

40:29.789 --> 40:33.789
...with their own kelp forests

40:34.790 --> 40:38.789
...and their own swarms of plankton.

40:45.791 --> 40:49.790
Some of the inhabitants of these seas
live only in the southern hemisphere.

40:50.792 --> 40:54.791
This is one of them - the handfish.
That strolls around on modified fins.

41:02.793 --> 41:06.792
But when needs must.
It can resort to tail power.

41:11.794 --> 41:15.793
Every summer visitors come
to the shallows around Tasmania.

41:15.794 --> 41:19.793
These are Australian squid.
About half a metre long.

41:22.795 --> 41:26.794
They are here to breed.

41:30.796 --> 41:33.795
The larger males compete for
the attentions of a female

41:33.796 --> 41:37.795
displaying towards her and to one
another by putting on a ballet,

41:37.796 --> 41:41.796
during which they continually change
the colour of their costumes.

42:11.800 --> 42:15.799
Eventually they form pairs.

42:20.801 --> 42:24.800
A male passes a packet of sperm
across to the female.

42:29.801 --> 42:33.801
After the eggs have been fertilised,
they are deposited in tough,

42:33.802 --> 42:37.801
rubbery egg cases that other
creatures find poisonous.

42:40.803 --> 42:44.802
Within three weeks the babies
are ready to hatch out.

42:50.804 --> 42:53.803
They are already able
to change colour

42:53.804 --> 42:57.803
but they're not quite
so good at swimming.

43:14.806 --> 43:18.805
There is another animal here that
is a rather more devoted parent.

43:19.806 --> 43:22.806
This is a male leafy sea dragon,

43:22.807 --> 43:26.806
an exquisitely decorated
relative of the sea horse.

43:28.807 --> 43:32.807
He is carrying his partner's
eggs around with him.

43:32.808 --> 43:36.807
They would be a highly nutritious snack
for any predator that found them.

43:38.808 --> 43:41.808
But that's not easy because
the eggs are attached

43:41.809 --> 43:44.808
to their father's perfectly
camouflaged body.

43:44.809 --> 43:48.808
They could scarcely be
in a safer place.

44:13.812 --> 44:17.811
By November, 10,000 miles to the north,
winter has arrived

44:19.812 --> 44:23.812
Norway now gets less than 5 hours
of daylight in every twenty four.

44:25.813 --> 44:29.812
The temperature is
falling rapidly.

44:29.813 --> 44:33.813
But despite the cold,
the sea is far from deserted.

44:34.814 --> 44:37.813
Every winter, 500 million
tonnes of adult

44:37.814 --> 44:41.814
herring seek shelter in
these deep waters.

44:44.815 --> 44:47.814
They will stay here for four months,
living entirely on the fat

44:47.815 --> 44:51.815
they accumulated during the
summer feasts of plankton.

44:53.816 --> 44:56.815
But they are not alone...

44:56.816 --> 45:00.816
Orca's his small pod is part
of a population

45:00.817 --> 45:02.816
of some five hundred
killer whales

45:02.817 --> 45:06.816
that specialise in hunting
North Atlantic herring.

45:20.819 --> 45:23.818
Using their echo-location
they have detected a shoal

45:23.819 --> 45:27.818
of herring 50 metres below them.

45:27.819 --> 45:30.819
With enough air for a 10 minute dive...

45:30.820 --> 45:34.819
they swim deep below the herring
and drive the fish upwards.

45:41.821 --> 45:43.820
Bubbles stream from the rising fish

45:43.821 --> 45:47.820
as gas in their swim bladders
expands and escapes.

45:53.822 --> 45:57.821
Even an orca finds it difficult
to catch a healthy herring.

45:59.822 --> 46:03.822
But they have a devastating
weapon all their own.

46:10.824 --> 46:14.823
They use their tail to club
the fish with waves of water pressure.

46:22.825 --> 46:26.824
Then it's simply a matter of collecting
the stunned casualties.

46:41.827 --> 46:45.826
The herrings have no chance and both orca
and gulls will eat as much as they can

46:47.827 --> 46:51.827
every day for the next four months.

46:55.828 --> 46:59.827
But there are so many fish wintering here,
over 5 billion individuals,

47:00.829 --> 47:04.828
that the losses are
almost unnoticeable.

47:12.830 --> 47:14.829
Violent as this Winter weather may be

47:14.830 --> 47:18.829
it's essential for the renewal of
the riches of the Seasonal Seas.

47:20.831 --> 47:24.830
Out in the open oceans, the surging
waters stir up nutrients from the depths.

47:31.832 --> 47:35.831
By the end of winter the Seasonal Seas
will be full of minerals once more,

47:35.832 --> 47:39.831
ready for the return of the sun
and the next great plankton bloom
