00:01.171 --> 00:02.622
<i>So here's what you missed
on Glee:</i>

00:02.706 --> 00:04.207
<i>The glee club's
getting ready for Nationals,</i>

00:04.258 --> 00:05.792
<i>and Quinn's getting ready
to be prom queen.</i>

00:05.876 --> 00:07.627
We need to get elected
for prom king and queen.

00:07.695 --> 00:08.594
It's the ultimate
status symbol.

00:08.679 --> 00:09.912
<i>Kurt had to leave McKinley</i>

00:09.963 --> 00:10.963
<i>because Karofsky
threatened him...</i>

00:11.031 --> 00:12.081
I can't expel a kid
for shoving.

00:12.132 --> 00:13.099
He'll just say, "I didn't mean

00:13.183 --> 00:14.500
to shove that kid.
I tripped."

00:14.568 --> 00:16.052
Excuse works like a charm.
I use it all the time.

00:16.103 --> 00:17.520
<i>But at least he's got
Blaine and the Warblers,</i>

00:17.587 --> 00:19.588
<i>who just lost at Regionals
to the New Directions!</i>

00:19.640 --> 00:21.107
We got each other
out of all this.

00:21.191 --> 00:23.192
That beats a lousy trophy,
don't you think?

00:23.260 --> 00:24.760
<i>Santana's got it bad
for Brittany...</i>

00:24.812 --> 00:26.062
This relationship
is really confusing for me.

00:26.113 --> 00:27.697
Breakfast is confusing for you.

00:27.765 --> 00:30.066
Well, sometimes it's sweet
and sometimes it's salty.

00:30.117 --> 00:32.735
Like, what if I have eggs
for dinner, then what is it?

00:32.786 --> 00:34.237
<i>Will's sort of always
had it bad for Emma,</i>

00:34.288 --> 00:35.538
<i>but lately she's gotten
super crazy</i>

00:35.605 --> 00:36.739
<i>with the cleaning fruit
and stuff.</i>

00:36.790 --> 00:38.458
<i>I'm not following.
Like, seriously crazy.</i>

00:38.542 --> 00:41.828
One day, you're going to find
a way to beat this thing.

00:41.912 --> 00:44.030
<i>And that's what you missed
on Glee.</i>

00:45.666 --> 00:46.799
All right, guys.

00:46.884 --> 00:48.468
Nationals are just
a few weeks away,

00:48.552 --> 00:50.136
and it's time to bear down.

00:50.220 --> 00:53.055
Now, your singing at Regionals
was amazing, but your dancing...

00:54.675 --> 00:56.342
It's booty camp time.

00:56.427 --> 00:57.510
Booty!
So let's get it going.

00:57.594 --> 00:59.011
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:00.797 --> 01:02.231
Push yourselves, guys.

01:02.299 --> 01:03.466
Vocal Adrenaline
takes no prisoners.

01:04.685 --> 01:06.635
Oh! I'm so sorry.

01:06.687 --> 01:07.937
Are you okay?

01:07.988 --> 01:09.071
I'm bleeding.

01:09.139 --> 01:10.773
Let's get you to a doctor.

01:13.026 --> 01:14.694
My dad's will be here
in 15 minutes.

01:14.778 --> 01:16.162
You don't have to stay, Finn.

01:16.246 --> 01:18.814
No, I want to wait
and hear what the doctor says.

01:18.866 --> 01:20.366
I feel terrible.

01:20.451 --> 01:23.419
Won't Quinn be mad at you
sitting vigil at my bedside?

01:23.487 --> 01:24.837
Well, I'm standing,

01:24.922 --> 01:27.707
and-and she'd understand
how awful I feel

01:27.775 --> 01:29.008
even if it's not broken.

01:29.092 --> 01:30.009
It's broken.

01:31.595 --> 01:33.596
Well, I knew
I was a bad dancer,

01:33.663 --> 01:35.264
but I never thought
my dancing was dangerous.

01:35.332 --> 01:37.666
It's a clean break, so
I-I won't have to set it.

01:37.718 --> 01:39.835
Considering your
deviated septum,

01:39.887 --> 01:42.004
I'd consider this a
terrific opportunity

01:42.055 --> 01:43.656
for a little vanity adjustment.

01:43.724 --> 01:45.892
Are you suggesting
that I get a nose job?

01:45.976 --> 01:47.193
You're 16, right?

01:47.277 --> 01:49.178
That's when I gave
my daughters theirs.

01:49.246 --> 01:50.980
It's like a right of
passage for Jewish girls.

01:51.031 --> 01:54.150
First of all, I like how I look.

01:54.201 --> 01:56.352
She your girlfriend?

01:56.420 --> 01:57.686
No.

01:57.738 --> 01:59.522
What does your
girlfriend look like?

01:59.573 --> 02:02.375
Okay, and second of all,
I don't want to do anything

02:02.459 --> 02:03.759
that's going to affect my voice.

02:03.827 --> 02:04.961
My Broadway career
depends on it.

02:05.028 --> 02:06.546
Yeah, we got a big show choir

02:06.630 --> 02:07.630
competition coming up,
and Rachel's

02:07.697 --> 02:08.697
kind of our best singer.

02:08.749 --> 02:09.749
Doesn't impact the voice.

02:09.833 --> 02:10.917
That's just a myth.

02:11.001 --> 02:12.835
The fact is, opening
up that septum

02:12.886 --> 02:15.538
might allow you to take
in more air per breath,

02:15.589 --> 02:17.423
which means bigger
belts on you high notes.

02:17.508 --> 02:19.708
But Barbra...

02:19.760 --> 02:22.728
Is great.
She's also one in a million.

02:24.731 --> 02:27.383
The fact is, if you really
want to be an actress,

02:27.434 --> 02:29.218
you might want to consider
looking and sounding

02:29.269 --> 02:30.736
the best that you can.

02:30.821 --> 02:33.272
I got an appointment
open next week.

02:33.357 --> 02:35.525
Can I sign you up?

02:36.814 --> 02:39.144
Sync by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

02:39.329 --> 02:41.747
Oh my God,
you're getting a nose job.

02:41.831 --> 02:44.283
I'm considering having
a minor procedure

02:44.367 --> 02:45.501
to repair my deviated septum.

02:45.568 --> 02:47.219
So, a nose job.

02:47.287 --> 02:50.172
Look, I'm... I'm happy
with the way that I look, okay?

02:50.239 --> 02:51.790
And I've embraced my nose.

02:51.875 --> 02:55.911
But let's say I wanted to have
a slightly more demure nose.

02:55.962 --> 02:58.097
Like Quinn's, for example.

02:58.181 --> 03:01.100
I-I would never change
my appearance for vanity,

03:01.184 --> 03:03.302
but, I mean, the doctor said

03:03.386 --> 03:05.320
that it could possibly
improve my talent,

03:05.388 --> 03:07.689
which would help us
all for Nationals.

03:07.757 --> 03:10.258
Possibly?
What about the risks?

03:10.310 --> 03:12.194
Your voice is amazing
as is, Rachel.

03:12.261 --> 03:13.445
Hold up.

03:13.530 --> 03:15.280
Could we all just
get real here for a second?

03:15.365 --> 03:17.766
I hear that Rachel's got
a bit of a schnoz.

03:17.817 --> 03:19.985
I mean, I wouldn't know
because, like Medusa, I try

03:20.070 --> 03:21.353
to avoid eye contact with her.

03:21.421 --> 03:22.771
But can we all just stop

03:22.822 --> 03:24.490
lying about how
there aren't things

03:24.574 --> 03:25.958
that we wouldn't change
about ourselves?

03:26.042 --> 03:29.128
I mean, I'm sure that Sam's been
at the doctor's office

03:29.212 --> 03:31.080
and rifled through pamphlets
on mouth reduction.

03:31.131 --> 03:32.798
I'll bet Artie's thought
about getting his legs removed

03:32.882 --> 03:34.083
since he's not really
using them anyways.

03:34.134 --> 03:36.418
And I'm definitely sure
that Tina's looked

03:36.469 --> 03:37.786
into getting an eye de-slanting.

03:37.837 --> 03:38.804
That's extraordinarily racist.

03:38.888 --> 03:40.122
I'm keepin' it real.

03:40.173 --> 03:41.974
Sorry, Santana.
I'm a beautiful person.

03:42.058 --> 03:44.626
I'm in love with myself, and I
would never change a thing.

03:44.677 --> 03:47.179
Is that why you're wearing
blue contacts today, Tina?

03:47.263 --> 03:49.565
Self-hating Asian.

03:49.632 --> 03:50.799
Not many Asian sex symbols,
Mike.

03:50.850 --> 03:52.434
I'm just trying to be in fashion

03:52.485 --> 03:54.269
and mirror what I see
in the magazines.

03:54.320 --> 03:55.988
My dancing kind of bothers me.

03:56.072 --> 04:00.025
Uh, it almost killed Rachel,
but I like the way I look.

04:00.110 --> 04:01.443
Oh, please.

04:01.494 --> 04:03.662
You have weird, puffy
pyramid nipples.

04:03.746 --> 04:05.247
They look like they're
filled with custard,

04:05.314 --> 04:06.698
or you could dust them

04:06.783 --> 04:08.200
with powdered sugar
and they could pass

04:08.284 --> 04:10.702
for some sort of dessert.

04:10.787 --> 04:13.705
Look, maybe Rachel's fine
with having an enormous beak.

04:13.790 --> 04:16.208
Maybe she needs it to crack
hard seeds. All I'm saying

04:16.291 --> 04:17.793
is that if you look
in the mirror

04:17.844 --> 04:19.928
and you don't like what you see,
you should change it.

04:19.995 --> 04:21.430
Whoa, guys.

04:21.497 --> 04:23.265
I'm really shocked
at what I'm hearing here.

04:23.332 --> 04:25.317
It goes against everything
the glee club stands for.

04:25.385 --> 04:28.437
I'm telling you, the thing
you would most like to change

04:28.504 --> 04:31.023
about yourself is the most
interesting part of you.

04:31.107 --> 04:32.975
Well, maybe,
but at this school,

04:33.026 --> 04:34.726
the thing
that makes you different

04:34.811 --> 04:36.512
is the thing people use
to crush your spirit.

04:44.037 --> 04:45.821
Rachel's a beautiful girl.

04:45.872 --> 04:47.522
She doesn't need a nose job.

04:47.574 --> 04:50.358
Saying that she's doing it
to enrich her talent is just

04:50.410 --> 04:52.161
a convenient excuse
to deal with the fact

04:52.212 --> 04:53.862
that she's insecure
about how she looks.

04:53.913 --> 04:56.198
Most of the adults we know
have trouble embracing

04:56.249 --> 04:58.133
their eccentricities, so
how can we expect kids to?

04:58.201 --> 05:00.385
Well, then, it should be
our job to help them.

05:00.470 --> 05:01.703
I don't want my legacy
as a teacher

05:01.754 --> 05:05.057
to be conjugated verbs
and Glee Club trophies.

05:05.141 --> 05:06.875
I want to help them
love themselves

05:06.926 --> 05:09.311
for who they are,
warts and all--

05:09.378 --> 05:11.013
Especially warts.

05:11.064 --> 05:12.681
How long do we have
to do this for?

05:12.732 --> 05:14.149
Until they're all clean.

05:14.217 --> 05:16.885
I mean, I'm really enjoying
helping you with your OCD.

05:16.936 --> 05:19.188
Do you know what? I really
don't like that term, really.

05:19.239 --> 05:20.939
It sounds way too
scientific and serious.

05:21.024 --> 05:23.225
I really prefer "neat
freak" or "cleanybug."

05:23.276 --> 05:25.110
But, Will, I really
have to tell you,

05:25.195 --> 05:28.247
I'm so appreciative
of all your help.

05:28.331 --> 05:29.915
Really, I have so
much more free time

05:29.999 --> 05:32.084
now that there are four hands
polishing all of my fruit.

05:32.168 --> 05:34.119
I'm really glad...

05:34.204 --> 05:35.370
but shouldn't we
be figuring out

05:35.421 --> 05:36.505
some techniques you can use

05:36.572 --> 05:38.406
to eat your food
without scrubbing it?

05:38.458 --> 05:40.575
You mean with germs and
pesticides all over it?

05:40.627 --> 05:44.463
No, I mean, really deal
with your issues on this stuff.

05:44.547 --> 05:47.182
Will, I've tried, you know,

05:47.250 --> 05:49.417
and I... I may not have
been born this way,

05:49.469 --> 05:51.586
but this is my lot in life.

05:51.638 --> 05:54.189
There's nothing I
can do about it.

05:54.257 --> 05:56.642
Thank you.

05:56.726 --> 05:58.560
What for?

05:58.611 --> 06:00.696
I know how I'm going
to get the kids

06:00.763 --> 06:02.731
to accept what
their differences are--

06:02.782 --> 06:04.983
By using their two
favorite teachers:

06:05.051 --> 06:08.237
Me and Gaga...

06:08.288 --> 06:10.205
but I'm going
to need your help.

06:14.210 --> 06:15.994
<i>I should be prom queen
at this school.</i>

06:16.079 --> 06:17.579
<i>If I were prom queen,</i>

06:17.630 --> 06:19.381
<i>I could get Brittany to drop
the four-eyed loser</i>

06:19.448 --> 06:21.550
<i>and go for the real queen.</i>

06:21.617 --> 06:23.001
<i>She's so gullible,
I could convince her</i>

06:23.086 --> 06:25.337
<i>that by royal decree,
I'd made her being with me</i>

06:25.421 --> 06:27.806
<i>the law of the land.</i>

06:27.890 --> 06:29.124
<i>That's never going to happen.</i>

06:29.175 --> 06:30.642
<i>I don't have the votes.</i>

06:30.727 --> 06:32.261
<i>Unless I could get
the jock block.</i>

06:32.312 --> 06:34.229
Jack Ryan, you've just boarded

06:34.297 --> 06:35.297
<i>the Red October.</i>

06:36.482 --> 06:37.316
Sean Connery.

06:39.135 --> 06:40.569
<i>And God knows Sam doesn't have</i>

06:40.636 --> 06:42.187
<i>the heat at this school yet.</i>

06:42.272 --> 06:44.139
<i>Hold on, there's someone
at this school</i>

06:44.190 --> 06:46.474
<i>who just might have
the juice...</i>

06:46.526 --> 06:47.576
<i>Dave Karofsky.</i>

06:50.079 --> 06:51.813
<i>Holy crap.</i>

06:53.649 --> 06:56.335
<i>I'm a closet lesbian
and a judgmental bitch,</i>

06:56.419 --> 06:59.288
I have awesome gaydar.

07:01.090 --> 07:03.658
You haven't asked us anything
about our New York trip.

07:03.710 --> 07:05.427
Is it because it's too painful?

07:05.494 --> 07:06.828
Yes, as a matter of fact,

07:06.879 --> 07:07.929
but while the New Directions!

07:07.997 --> 07:09.831
Are preparing
to perform at Nationals,

07:09.882 --> 07:12.334
the Warblers are preparing
to perform at a nursing home

07:12.385 --> 07:14.186
in a strip mall
next to a National Bank.

07:15.688 --> 07:16.938
But I'm so proud of you guys.

07:17.006 --> 07:18.506
We miss you so much.

07:18.558 --> 07:20.859
Isn't there any way you
could come back to McKinley?

07:20.943 --> 07:23.779
I told him, I would be all for
it if it wasn't for Karofsky.

07:24.981 --> 07:26.481
Wait, what did you just say?

07:26.532 --> 07:27.899
Kurt needs to be safe.

07:27.967 --> 07:29.684
Okay, can we please
change subject?

07:29.736 --> 07:31.320
<i>- I'm just saying...
- That's it.</i>

07:31.387 --> 07:34.456
<i>Kurt's the trick to winning
prom queen and getting Britt,</i>

07:34.523 --> 07:37.209
<i>not to mention totally boosting
our chances at Nationals.</i>

07:37.293 --> 07:40.295
<i>If I could get Kurt back,
I'd be a hero.</i>

07:40.363 --> 07:41.830
<i>Even Quinn and Finn
would vote for me.</i>

07:41.881 --> 07:43.332
<i>And the key?</i>

07:43.383 --> 07:44.249
<i>Karofsky.</i>

07:45.802 --> 07:47.102
I've got to gay-- Go.

07:47.170 --> 07:48.203
Go-- I've got to go.

07:52.308 --> 07:55.377
Um, why is Ms. Pillsbury here?

07:55.428 --> 07:57.062
She's helping us out
with this week's assignment.

07:57.146 --> 07:58.397
Now, this is the only club

07:58.464 --> 07:59.598
at school that is represented

07:59.682 --> 08:02.217
by just about every race,
religion,

08:02.285 --> 08:04.386
sexual orientation and clique,

08:04.437 --> 08:06.855
but many of you are still having
a hard time with acceptance.

08:06.906 --> 08:08.874
That's crazy, Mr. Shue.
We love each other.

08:08.941 --> 08:10.659
No, I won't deny that
you accept each other,

08:10.726 --> 08:12.911
but you don't
accept yourselves.

08:12.979 --> 08:14.663
This week's assignment
has two parts.

08:14.730 --> 08:17.449
I want all of you to sing
songs about accepting yourself

08:17.533 --> 08:21.286
for who you are-- The
best and the worst parts.

08:21.371 --> 08:23.255
What's the second part?
Well,

08:23.339 --> 08:24.790
we're going to do
a group number

08:24.874 --> 08:26.842
by the queen
of self-love--

08:26.909 --> 08:28.243
Gaga.

08:28.294 --> 08:30.128
We're going to perform

08:30.213 --> 08:32.631
her anthem to acceptance--
"Born This Way."

08:32.715 --> 08:35.015
Yes!

08:35.083 --> 08:38.720
Wait, wait, I still don't know
why Ms. Pillsbury is here.

08:38.770 --> 08:41.073
I'm here to help you with your
costumes for the big number.

08:41.140 --> 08:42.890
Each of you will be issued
a beautifully fitted

08:42.942 --> 08:44.592
white T-shirt.

08:44.644 --> 08:47.762
We will then use
this letter press...

08:47.814 --> 08:49.264
to write a word or a phrase

08:49.332 --> 08:50.899
that best describes
the thing about you

08:50.950 --> 08:52.150
that you're the most ashamed of

08:52.235 --> 08:54.069
or you'd like to
change but you can't

08:54.120 --> 08:56.604
because you were born that way,
which is super terrific. I want you

08:56.656 --> 08:58.606
to love those parts of you,
you know, embrace them,

08:58.658 --> 08:59.908
wear them on your
chest with pride.

08:59.959 --> 09:01.993
Can you give an example?

09:02.078 --> 09:03.578
Yeah.

09:03.629 --> 09:04.996
It's the big moment.

09:11.087 --> 09:12.104
Wow, Emma, I thought
the whole purpose

09:12.171 --> 09:13.422
of you doing this
was to write...

09:13.473 --> 09:16.892
Being a ginger has plagued me
my entire life.

09:16.959 --> 09:18.593
People say
that I smell like copper,

09:18.644 --> 09:20.762
I can get a sunburn
indoors at night,

09:20.813 --> 09:23.131
and according to recent legend,
I have no soul,

09:23.199 --> 09:24.266
but I'm here to say
that this very curse

09:24.317 --> 09:26.268
is what makes me unique.

09:26.319 --> 09:28.186
Children,

09:28.271 --> 09:30.739
I claim my gingerhood
before you today.

09:32.475 --> 09:34.659
I was born this way.

09:34.744 --> 09:35.977
Hooray.

09:36.028 --> 09:37.279
Hooray!

09:37.330 --> 09:38.530
Hooray!

09:40.000 --> 09:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:54.152 --> 09:56.069
Those crowns are a crock.

09:56.154 --> 09:57.321
You know what I found out?

09:57.388 --> 09:58.322
Not real jewels.

09:58.389 --> 09:59.990
A crown hasn't rested on my head

10:00.057 --> 10:03.811
since I won
Miss Tiara Toddler Allen County.

10:03.878 --> 10:05.028
Are you serious?

10:05.079 --> 10:07.397
Yeah, three years in a row.

10:07.449 --> 10:09.199
I dominated
in Western Wear and Runway,

10:09.250 --> 10:11.919
but my real talent
was baby pull-ups.

10:12.003 --> 10:14.588
31!

10:14.672 --> 10:17.207
32! 33!

10:20.745 --> 10:24.014
I was on my way
to becoming Miss Ohio.

10:24.081 --> 10:25.432
That is, until the shoddy
Zizes thyroid kicked in

10:25.517 --> 10:26.884
as well as a love of chips,

10:26.935 --> 10:28.018
and suddenly I was denied entry

10:28.085 --> 10:29.636
into the pageant circuit.

10:29.721 --> 10:31.889
They said I no longer
looked the part.

10:31.940 --> 10:32.856
My dreams were dashed.

10:35.426 --> 10:38.362
There's our future queen...

10:38.429 --> 10:40.764
a size-two
teenage dream.

10:40.815 --> 10:42.533
You know what?

10:42.600 --> 10:44.151
We're going to change that.

10:44.235 --> 10:45.986
How?

10:46.070 --> 10:47.454
Baby,

10:47.539 --> 10:50.290
you're going to get that crown,
and I'm gonna be your king.

10:56.030 --> 10:57.915
Thanks for doing this.

10:57.966 --> 10:59.449
I'm surprised
more girls haven't asked me.

10:59.501 --> 11:00.801
My nose is awesome.

11:00.885 --> 11:03.119
I can totally count
on your vote,

11:03.171 --> 11:05.873
right?
Yeah. To... totally.

11:12.680 --> 11:16.299
So, what's it like?

11:16.351 --> 11:18.268
Looking like you look?

11:18.319 --> 11:20.204
I pretty much have
a warped sense of the world.

11:20.271 --> 11:22.656
Being a hot 17-year-old,

11:22.740 --> 11:25.275
you can get away with
or do anything you want,

11:25.326 --> 11:26.977
so I kind of always assume

11:27.045 --> 11:29.246
that people are always nice
and accommodating.

11:30.331 --> 11:32.332
Okay. So,

11:32.417 --> 11:34.418
we, uh,
ready to pull the trigger?

11:34.485 --> 11:36.820
No, not... not quite yet.
Um, I was kind of hoping

11:36.871 --> 11:39.289
that I could get an idea
of what I might look like

11:39.357 --> 11:40.424
after the procedure.

11:40.491 --> 11:43.544
Um, this is my friend Quinn.

11:43.628 --> 11:45.161
Nice nose.

11:45.213 --> 11:47.047
Thank you.
Very nice.

11:47.131 --> 11:49.266
Yeah, well, Rachel wants it.

11:49.334 --> 11:50.717
No problem.

11:50.802 --> 11:52.886
So I'll click some pics,
make up some photo composites.

11:52.971 --> 11:54.170

to rock and roll.

Beautiful job, ladies.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.173
She's got my vote.

14:26.257 --> 14:27.674
She's such an inspiration.

14:27.759 --> 14:30.427
It's nice to see someone like me
on a poster for a change.

14:34.832 --> 14:37.167
What are you doing?

14:37.218 --> 14:38.635
Oh, hey.
I'm running for prom queen.

14:38.686 --> 14:40.003
As a joke, right?

14:40.054 --> 14:41.805
Does it look like I'm joking?

14:41.856 --> 14:43.273
Well, when your name appears
on that ballot,

14:43.340 --> 14:44.858
the whole school's going
to think it's a laugh riot,

14:44.942 --> 14:46.276
and you may just
get enough votes to win.

14:46.343 --> 14:48.311
That's sort of the idea.

14:48.362 --> 14:49.780
And as everybody snickers
as they try

14:49.847 --> 14:51.281
to squeeze that tiara
onto your head,

14:51.348 --> 14:52.866
somebody's going
to spill pig's blood on you,

14:52.950 --> 14:54.350
or something like that,
and you'll become

14:54.402 --> 14:55.986
more of an outcast
than you already are.

14:56.037 --> 14:59.573
Okay. I don't know exactly
what your problem is,

14:59.657 --> 15:00.791
but you best bring it, Fabray.

15:00.858 --> 15:02.459
Because I'm hot as hell,

15:02.526 --> 15:04.494
I keep it real, and the
people at this school

15:04.545 --> 15:05.746
want a prom queen
who's like them.

15:05.830 --> 15:06.997
No, they want a prom queen

15:07.048 --> 15:08.298
who's somebody
they'd like to be.

15:08.365 --> 15:09.666
Look.

15:09.717 --> 15:11.468
Not everybody can be
born pretty like you.

15:11.535 --> 15:13.503
But just so you know,
who you are inside

15:13.554 --> 15:15.338
and who you pretend to be
to the rest of the world--

15:15.389 --> 15:16.539
They're two different people.

15:16.591 --> 15:17.974
You don't know anything
about me, Lauren.

15:18.042 --> 15:20.393
Anything.
But you know what?

15:20.478 --> 15:22.429
You're about to.

15:22.513 --> 15:23.663
Because it just got personal.

15:29.670 --> 15:31.671
I knew you'd
ask me out eventually.

15:31.756 --> 15:33.340
I'm kind of Duke Stud
at McKinley.

15:33.424 --> 15:35.242
Give it up. I know.

15:35.309 --> 15:36.426
Know what?

15:36.494 --> 15:37.511
That you're gay.

15:37.595 --> 15:39.679
What? Who told you that?

15:39.764 --> 15:41.214
No one had to tell me.

15:41.282 --> 15:43.350
First of all, I saw you checking
out Sam's ass the other day.

15:43.434 --> 15:45.135
You know, you really need

15:45.186 --> 15:46.920
to be more careful
with your leering.

15:46.988 --> 15:49.189
I didn't. I was just seeing
what jeans he was wearing.

15:49.273 --> 15:50.507
Like that's any less gay.

15:50.575 --> 15:52.642
Second of all, I know
about you and Kurt.

15:52.693 --> 15:54.861
Remember last week
before the benefit?

15:54.946 --> 15:58.281
About you being worried about
"the truth" getting out.

15:58.349 --> 15:59.783
Guess what. It's out.

15:59.850 --> 16:02.235
Whatever they told you
is a lie to mess with me.

16:02.320 --> 16:04.237
I'm going to kick their asses.

16:04.322 --> 16:06.206
Okay, you know what? Why
don't you just settle down

16:06.290 --> 16:09.025
and let Auntie Tana here
tell you a little story.

16:09.076 --> 16:10.693
It's about you.

16:10.745 --> 16:12.579
You're what we call
a "late in life gay."

16:12.663 --> 16:14.581
You're going to
stay in the closet,

16:14.665 --> 16:17.000
get married, get drunk to have
relations with your wife,

16:17.051 --> 16:18.869
have a couple kids,
maybe become

16:18.936 --> 16:21.471
a state senator or a deacon,

16:21.539 --> 16:23.390
and then get caught in the
men's room tapping your foot

16:23.474 --> 16:25.308
with some page,
and you know what?

16:25.376 --> 16:27.093
I accept that about you.

16:27.178 --> 16:29.346
Why are you doing this?

16:29.397 --> 16:31.431
Because I need you,

16:31.516 --> 16:34.401
and you need me.

16:34.485 --> 16:36.586
We play on the same team.

16:38.155 --> 16:39.656
You're...

16:39.723 --> 16:40.890
Look, I'm not ready

16:40.942 --> 16:42.359
to start eating jicama

16:42.410 --> 16:43.693
or get a flat top yet, either.

16:43.744 --> 16:45.028
Maybe in junior college.

16:45.079 --> 16:46.079
This is garbage.

16:46.163 --> 16:47.330
I'm not gay.

16:47.398 --> 16:49.416
I'm trying to
help you out here.

16:49.500 --> 16:52.068
Have you ever heard
of the term "beards?"

16:52.119 --> 16:53.587
It's when a gay man and woman

16:53.671 --> 16:55.705
date each other to hide
the fact that they're gay.

16:55.756 --> 16:57.290
Like the Roosevelts.

16:57.375 --> 16:59.409
So you and I are going to
be each other's beards,

16:59.460 --> 17:00.794
and then we're going to win

17:00.878 --> 17:02.579
prom king and queen
and rule the school.

17:02.630 --> 17:03.847
And what if I say no?

17:03.914 --> 17:05.281
Then I'm going to tell
everyone about you,

17:05.348 --> 17:07.517
and your life will be over.

17:07.585 --> 17:09.519
The only straight I am
is straight-up bitch.

17:09.587 --> 17:11.221
You in or not?

17:16.875 --> 17:17.907
What you're doing is terrible.

17:17.960 --> 17:19.242
I have a nice nose.

17:19.294 --> 17:21.212
Rachel asked me for help,
and I'm giving it to her.

17:21.262 --> 17:22.547
And once again, we are
fighting about Rachel.

17:22.598 --> 17:23.931
I'm your girlfriend.

17:24.016 --> 17:26.166
Look, this isn't about
who's my girlfriend.

17:26.234 --> 17:27.417
Mr. Shue is
trying to get us

17:27.469 --> 17:28.803
to accept ourselves
for who we are,

17:28.887 --> 17:30.254
and you're helping Rachel
do the exact opposite.

17:30.305 --> 17:31.723
That's not cool.
Yeah, well, maybe

17:31.774 --> 17:33.591
I'm not down
with this week's lesson.

17:38.714 --> 17:40.281
I love this lesson.

All right, Finn!

19:55.584 --> 19:56.918
Perfect! See, guys,
someone who's not afraid

19:57.002 --> 19:58.619
to point out something
they're really bad at.

19:58.704 --> 20:01.389
But I'm getting better, right?

20:02.624 --> 20:04.742
Mr. Schuester?

20:04.793 --> 20:05.960
May I have the floor, please?

20:06.044 --> 20:08.296
It's yours.

20:08.380 --> 20:11.215
So, as all of you know,
I've had a few consultations

20:11.266 --> 20:13.083
with a doctor who specializes
in rhinoplasty.

20:13.135 --> 20:14.685
Yes, we know.

20:14.753 --> 20:17.021
That's all any of us
have been talking about.

20:17.088 --> 20:19.307
And we think it's
a terrible idea.

20:19.374 --> 20:21.609
Okay. Blue eyes,
you're such a hypocrite.

20:21.693 --> 20:23.928
I admit, yes, I don't like
my eyes sometimes--

20:23.979 --> 20:25.413
The shape, the color--

20:25.480 --> 20:28.032
But your self-hatred, Rachel,
has helped me see the light.

20:28.099 --> 20:29.867
I love myself.

20:29.935 --> 20:31.285
Not enough, clearly.

20:31.370 --> 20:33.237
When you get a nose job,
when you change your eyes,

20:33.288 --> 20:34.789
when you bleach your freckles,

20:34.873 --> 20:36.073
you're just announcing
to the world,

20:36.124 --> 20:37.775
"I don't like myself very much."

20:37.826 --> 20:39.560
The drams of this week

20:39.628 --> 20:41.111
have made me realize,

20:41.163 --> 20:43.831
if I don't have many Asian
sex symbols to look up to,

20:43.916 --> 20:46.133
I have an obligation
to maybe become one myself.

20:46.218 --> 20:47.602
My new mantra is

20:47.669 --> 20:50.287
"Be the change you want
to see in the world."

20:50.339 --> 20:52.173
I love you so much right now.

20:55.727 --> 20:58.729
Uh... okay, uh...
Okay, okay, okay.

20:58.797 --> 21:01.732
Besides Tina's abrupt
personal transformation,

21:01.800 --> 21:03.601
the compositions came back
from the doctor,

21:03.652 --> 21:06.020
showing what my nose would
look like slightly altered,

21:06.104 --> 21:08.823
and I have to say, I'm really
happy with the results.

21:08.907 --> 21:12.410
They're less Hebraic,
and more Fabrayic.

21:18.216 --> 21:20.484
That doesn't really
look like you.

21:20.535 --> 21:22.253
Every year, girls
show up to my temple

21:22.320 --> 21:23.487
after their 16th birthday,

21:23.538 --> 21:25.790
looking suddenly
slightly different.

21:25.841 --> 21:27.157
And you know what?

21:27.209 --> 21:28.926
Even though it's easier
to make out with them

21:28.994 --> 21:30.628
without getting constantly
stabbed in the eye,

21:30.679 --> 21:32.046
they're not as hot.

21:32.130 --> 21:33.998
Well, this isn't
about being hot.

21:34.049 --> 21:35.833
It's about conquering
your destiny,

21:35.884 --> 21:38.519
and finding something in
yourself that you want to change

21:38.587 --> 21:40.104
and change it.

21:40.171 --> 21:44.008
Plus, they said that it
could improve my voice, so...

21:44.059 --> 21:46.527
Look, if you guys aren't willing
to support my decision,

21:46.612 --> 21:49.614
then I'm pretty accustomed
to making it on my own.

21:49.681 --> 21:50.815
Rachel, please don't do this.

21:53.285 --> 21:54.318
You're beautiful.

22:01.960 --> 22:03.661
This isn't a discussion.

22:03.712 --> 22:06.297
I have made up my mind.

22:06.364 --> 22:08.299
Rachel Berry
is getting a nose job.

22:13.890 --> 22:15.224
Hey.
Hey.

22:15.291 --> 22:17.176
How's the assignment going?

22:17.260 --> 22:18.761
Well, I actually wanted
to talk to you about that.

22:18.812 --> 22:19.978
Oh.

22:20.063 --> 22:21.513
The word you put
on your T-shirt.

22:21.598 --> 22:23.649
Ginger?

22:23.733 --> 22:25.467
Right.

22:25.518 --> 22:27.236
I was a little disappointed.

22:27.303 --> 22:30.689
You and I both know
you should have put OCD on it.

22:30.774 --> 22:32.658
Well, I don't think
it's appropriate

22:32.742 --> 22:35.077
to talk about
such personal things with them.

22:35.144 --> 22:37.196
Really, those kids
have to trust me.

22:37.280 --> 22:38.197
I'm supposed to
be a role model.

22:38.281 --> 22:40.699
And you're not being one.

22:40.784 --> 22:42.968
We're trying to teach these kids
to... to accept themselves,

22:43.036 --> 22:44.420
and you refuse to.

22:44.487 --> 22:46.588
Will, you know
I wasn't born this way.

22:46.656 --> 22:48.791
It all started when I was five.

22:48.842 --> 22:50.259
And you never had
any anxiety before that?

22:50.326 --> 22:52.378
I understand I was
a very colicky baby.

22:52.462 --> 22:54.012
I mean, I remember getting
kicked out of preschool

22:54.097 --> 22:56.548
because I was having
panic attacks when they made us

22:56.633 --> 22:57.783
use manila paper, but...

22:57.851 --> 22:59.835
You have a severe
anxiety disorder, Emma.

22:59.886 --> 23:02.388
All of us just humor it
because you function so well,

23:02.472 --> 23:03.856
and you're so cute about it,

23:03.940 --> 23:06.058
but it's really keeping you
from enjoying your life.

23:06.142 --> 23:07.226
Okay, fine.
Do you know what?

23:07.310 --> 23:09.111
If you want me to wear a shirt

23:09.178 --> 23:10.979
that says "Batty"
or "Loon" on it, I will.

23:11.047 --> 23:12.514
Totally fine.

23:12.565 --> 23:14.032
So what if I like my fruit
free of contaminants?

23:14.117 --> 23:15.317
Isn't that healthy?

23:15.368 --> 23:17.703
You know what I want?

23:19.188 --> 23:20.789
I want you
to have lunch with me.

23:22.158 --> 23:23.459
Is that unwashed fruit?

23:23.526 --> 23:25.961
Yep. Here.

23:26.028 --> 23:27.579
Have a blueberry.

23:27.664 --> 23:28.881
Ugh!

23:28.965 --> 23:30.499
Come on.
Uh-uh.

23:30.550 --> 23:32.367
No. Stop. This isn't funny.

23:32.419 --> 23:33.969
I'm just trying
to help you get better.

23:34.036 --> 23:36.388
I think accepting the fact
that you have a problem

23:36.473 --> 23:37.706
is the first step.

23:37.757 --> 23:39.141
Okay, what?
And you think torturing me

23:39.208 --> 23:41.059
with unwashed fruit's
going to make me take that step?

23:43.646 --> 23:45.547
You know what I think, Emma?

23:45.598 --> 23:47.850
I think you are an expert
at deflection.

23:47.901 --> 23:49.251
Is that a new shirt?

23:49.319 --> 23:51.086
And I think you work so hard

23:51.154 --> 23:52.688
at helping other people--
Counseling them--

23:52.739 --> 23:55.707
So that you can avoid doing the
hard, painful work on yourself.

24:04.734 --> 24:06.535
Okay, listen, I'm all...
That's all I'm asking for.

24:06.586 --> 24:08.120
Let me finish.
Excuse me.

24:08.204 --> 24:09.788
Quiet!
No.

24:09.873 --> 24:11.907
Quiet, okay?
We don't care what he has to say.

24:11.958 --> 24:14.676
Shh. Now, I know David has
had some issues in the past,

24:14.744 --> 24:17.663
but I have great respect
for what he's doing right now,

24:17.730 --> 24:19.765
and I ask you to hear him out.

24:19.833 --> 24:20.933
Thank you.
How about we punch his face?

24:21.017 --> 24:22.184
Right.
Okay, that's enough, guys.

24:22.251 --> 24:23.318
Excuse me.
Everyone listen up.

24:23.386 --> 24:26.138
First, I just want
to say how sorry I am

24:26.222 --> 24:28.423
for what I did to Kurt

24:28.491 --> 24:31.693
and for what I've done
to a lot of you.

24:31.761 --> 24:35.230
I think I've slushied
every one of you.

24:43.122 --> 24:45.290
I treated Kurt the worst,

24:45.375 --> 24:47.960
and I'm really ashamed

24:48.044 --> 24:49.995
of who I am

24:50.063 --> 24:52.881
and what I did.

24:52.949 --> 24:54.166
Why should we believe you?

24:54.250 --> 24:55.717
You don't have to.

24:55.785 --> 24:57.970
I know I'll need
to earn your trust.

24:58.054 --> 25:01.139
All I can say is that Santana
has really helped me

25:01.224 --> 25:02.925
to see the light.

25:02.976 --> 25:05.811
She showed me all these stories
online about kids

25:05.879 --> 25:08.680
jumping off of bridges
and hanging themselves

25:08.765 --> 25:11.617
because they were
being bullied so bad.

25:11.684 --> 25:13.235
I couldn't believe

25:13.302 --> 25:16.238
someone could make
another person feel that awful,

25:16.305 --> 25:18.407
but she helped me accept

25:18.474 --> 25:20.492
that I was one
of those bad people,

25:20.577 --> 25:23.946
and I don't want to be anymore.

25:23.997 --> 25:26.448
Wait. Santana?

25:28.317 --> 25:30.151
This Glee Club is not complete.

25:30.203 --> 25:32.671
Not without Kurt.

25:32.755 --> 25:36.008
So I've taken it upon myself
to try to rehabilitate Dave

25:36.092 --> 25:38.493
to see if maybe Kurt would

25:38.545 --> 25:41.547
consider coming back
and help us win nationals.

25:41.631 --> 25:43.682
I did this for us,

25:43.766 --> 25:47.002
and then
something funny happened.

25:48.838 --> 25:51.506
Something... called love.

25:52.859 --> 25:53.959
I'm going to barf.

25:54.027 --> 25:55.978
I want Kurt to feel safe

25:56.029 --> 25:58.530
to come back, which is why

25:58.615 --> 26:01.400
Santana and I have
started a new club--

26:01.484 --> 26:03.184
The Bully Whips.

26:03.236 --> 26:05.070
The name was my idea.

26:05.154 --> 26:06.705
We're going to be like
guardian angels.

26:06.789 --> 26:09.491
I have deputized
David and Santana

26:09.542 --> 26:11.994
and the rest of their club
to roam the halls,

26:12.045 --> 26:14.713
identifying bullying
and stopping it in its tracks.

26:14.797 --> 26:16.999
I'm saying
I want the pants, okay?

26:17.050 --> 26:19.501
The ones you have on right now.

26:19.552 --> 26:21.587
Then, what will I wear
for the rest of the day?

26:21.671 --> 26:24.172
That's a YP-- Your problem,
not an MP-- My problem.

26:24.223 --> 26:26.475
Hey, Z, back off.
Say what?

26:26.542 --> 26:27.759
What is this? Berets?

26:27.844 --> 26:29.377
Everyone deserves a safe

26:29.429 --> 26:31.013
school environment.
Don't pick on this kid.

26:31.064 --> 26:33.565
It's not cool,
and we won't allow it anymore.

26:33.650 --> 26:35.934
I'm planning on reaching
out to Kurt personally,

26:36.019 --> 26:37.385
through Principal Figgins,

26:37.437 --> 26:39.905
to try to make amends.

26:39.989 --> 26:41.990
This is a chance
to really change this place.

26:42.058 --> 26:43.825
I hope you can support us.

26:50.021 --> 26:53.023
You know, you talk a great game,
but all I'm hearing is talk,

26:53.107 --> 26:55.008
and talk isn't going
to keep Kurt safe.

26:55.059 --> 26:57.227
But the anti-bullying club
that David started will.

26:57.311 --> 26:58.845
The fact is,

26:58.896 --> 27:00.981
since the club began enforcing
the no-bullying rule,

27:01.032 --> 27:02.365
we haven't had one incident.

27:02.450 --> 27:05.351
Yeah, and if I took
all the water out of the ocean,

27:05.403 --> 27:07.821
it wouldn't be wet anymore.

27:07.872 --> 27:12.208
The bullying stopped because
your top offender stopped.

27:12.293 --> 27:14.160
Mr. Hummel.
Can I call you Burt?

27:14.211 --> 27:15.128
Of course.

27:15.195 --> 27:16.463
You remember how understanding

27:16.530 --> 27:18.531
I was about this
when it all began.

27:18.582 --> 27:19.883
I didn't come
to David's defense.

27:19.967 --> 27:21.351
I believed your son.

27:21.419 --> 27:23.703
That's because the David
I was seeing was not

27:23.754 --> 27:25.522
the young man I knew.

27:25.589 --> 27:27.707
The boy I raised
was a Cub Scout.

27:27.758 --> 27:29.509
He was kind,
he was a good citizen.

27:29.577 --> 27:31.210
I still don't know
what was going through

27:31.262 --> 27:32.712
his mind when all
this bullying stared,

27:32.763 --> 27:35.015
but I can tell you
that the David I'm seeing now

27:35.082 --> 27:36.716
is my son, back again.

27:36.767 --> 27:38.768
This... this is real.

27:38.853 --> 27:41.321
Do you have any idea
how much stress

27:41.388 --> 27:43.773
this has caused my family?

27:43.858 --> 27:46.059
My son having
to leave his friends.

27:46.110 --> 27:47.861
My wife and I spending money

27:47.912 --> 27:50.280
we don't have on private school
'cause of your son.

27:50.364 --> 27:53.666
Burt, were you always
so accepting of homosexuals?

27:53.734 --> 27:55.335
We're the same age.

27:55.402 --> 27:56.953
I remember what we used to say

27:57.038 --> 27:58.371
about the gays
when we were younger.

27:58.439 --> 27:59.672
Now, it's taken us

27:59.740 --> 28:01.458
a long time
to figure out what's right.

28:01.542 --> 28:03.576
Why can't you just allow David
the couple months

28:03.627 --> 28:05.512
that it's taken him
to figure it out?

28:05.579 --> 28:07.797
Because he said
he's going to kill my son!

28:07.882 --> 28:09.049
I never actually
meant that, though.

28:09.100 --> 28:10.183
It's just a figure of speech.

28:10.250 --> 28:12.018
How's he supposed to know what?

28:12.086 --> 28:13.553
Your words still matter, David.

28:13.604 --> 28:14.971
I know.

28:15.056 --> 28:17.357
You have to believe
how awful I feel about them.

28:17.424 --> 28:20.060
Those ones, especially.

28:20.111 --> 28:21.694
That's not me.
Not anymore.

28:22.880 --> 28:24.280
What do you think, Kurt?

28:26.934 --> 28:29.152
I believe he realizes
what he did was wrong.

28:29.220 --> 28:30.987
You're only saying
that because you want

28:31.072 --> 28:32.372
to be back in this
school so bad.

28:34.458 --> 28:36.810
Can Dave and I speak
for a moment alone?

28:38.045 --> 28:40.580
You can wait
right outside in the hall.

28:40.631 --> 28:42.916
Let's go.

28:42.967 --> 28:44.834
Yeah.

28:50.975 --> 28:53.309
What's your angle here?

28:53.394 --> 28:55.595
I'm just trying
to make things right.

28:55.646 --> 28:57.797
David, I know, remember?

28:57.848 --> 28:58.965
And I haven't told anyone.

28:59.016 --> 29:01.468
Why? It would have made
your life

29:01.535 --> 29:02.652
a lot easier.

29:02.736 --> 29:04.687
I don't believe
in denying who you are,

29:04.772 --> 29:07.407
but I don't believe
in outing, either.

29:07.474 --> 29:08.808
But still, you owe me

29:08.859 --> 29:10.810
the truth.

29:10.878 --> 29:12.695
What's going on here?

29:16.650 --> 29:18.701
It was Santana's idea.

29:18.786 --> 29:20.153
She wants to be prom queen,

29:20.204 --> 29:22.122
so she figures,
if we can get you back,

29:22.173 --> 29:23.656
we'll get everyone
to vote for us.

29:23.724 --> 29:27.894
I'm both repulsed and impressed
by her Lady Macbethian ways.

29:27.962 --> 29:31.047
Hmm. A Latina Eve Harrington.

29:31.132 --> 29:32.265
Okay, if you're
going to be gay,

29:32.332 --> 29:34.050
you simply must know
who that is.

29:34.135 --> 29:35.935
Look, I don't know
for sure I am gay, okay?

29:36.003 --> 29:37.821
Stop being such
a broken record.

29:39.840 --> 29:42.442
Okay, I have
several options here.

29:42.509 --> 29:45.311
I could tell everyone
the truth about you...

29:45.362 --> 29:47.346
Dude, I said I'm sorry.
You said you wouldn't do that!

29:47.398 --> 29:49.149
Hold on.

29:49.200 --> 29:52.685
Or I can return here
and marvel with pride

29:52.736 --> 29:54.154
at your new
anti-bullying movement,

29:54.205 --> 29:56.156
which I fully believe in,

29:56.207 --> 29:58.291
and further demand
that you and I start a chapter

29:58.358 --> 30:00.660
of PFLAG here
at William McKinley.

30:00.711 --> 30:03.213
Parents, Family and Friends
of Lesbians and Gays.

30:04.865 --> 30:07.700
You need to be educated, David.

30:07.751 --> 30:11.171
You may not have to come out,
but you need to be educated.

30:11.238 --> 30:14.474
Oh, man, just kill me now.

30:14.541 --> 30:17.043
Just keep an eye
on your brother.

30:17.094 --> 30:18.945
One step ahead of you.

30:39.083 --> 30:41.734
You can't be in here, Noah.

30:41.785 --> 30:43.253
It's cool. I checked through
the peep hole I drilled

30:43.337 --> 30:44.570
last year
to make sure no one was going.

30:44.622 --> 30:46.739
What can I help you with today?

30:46.790 --> 30:49.342
I just want to talk to you,
one hot Jew to another.

30:49.409 --> 30:50.877
Oh, God.
Look, it's my nose, okay?

30:50.928 --> 30:52.378
I am tired of the lectures.

30:52.429 --> 30:54.764
Hear me out. Why are you
getting Quinn's nose?

30:54.848 --> 30:56.182
If you want to breathe better,

30:56.250 --> 30:57.784
why don't you have him give you
Karl Malden's nose?

30:57.851 --> 30:59.385
Your nose has been passed down

30:59.436 --> 31:01.137
from generation
to generation as a birthright.

31:01.222 --> 31:03.422
It's a sign of the survival
of our people.

31:03.474 --> 31:05.808
This has nothing to do
with our religion.

31:05.893 --> 31:08.444
I need one hour of your time
tomorrow. Just one hour.

31:08.529 --> 31:10.280
Give me that,
and I'll never bug you again.

31:14.201 --> 31:15.818
What the hell is going on?

31:15.903 --> 31:18.871
Well, my fellow Glee Clubbers,

31:18.939 --> 31:22.208
it's noon, which means...
it's official.

31:22.276 --> 31:23.276
What's official?

31:23.327 --> 31:24.777
My transfer!

31:24.828 --> 31:26.829
Kurt Hummel's back at McKinley!

31:31.785 --> 31:33.002
Hi.

31:33.087 --> 31:35.004
Let me breathe!
Let me breathe!

31:35.089 --> 31:36.389
Let's get ready for Nationals.

31:36.456 --> 31:38.091
Not yet.

31:38.142 --> 31:40.293
See, there's a reason
we're meeting here today.

31:40.344 --> 31:42.628
There's some people that wanted
to say good-bye to you, Kurt.

31:45.983 --> 31:47.817
Kurt,

31:47.901 --> 31:49.602
Dalton's going to miss you.

31:49.653 --> 31:51.854
You were a great addition
to the Warblers,

31:51.939 --> 31:55.275
and you made us a better team.

31:55.326 --> 31:56.993
I'm sad to see you
go, but we all know

31:57.077 --> 31:59.612
this is something
that you really want.

31:59.663 --> 32:02.365
And I'll still have you after
school and on the weekends,

32:02.449 --> 32:05.285
but these guys won't,
so they wanted to say good-bye.

32:05.336 --> 32:06.703
And thank you, Kurt.

Hey, Lucy.

39:35.035 --> 39:37.019
What did you just call me?

39:37.071 --> 39:39.822
Well, that certainly got
your attention.

39:39.873 --> 39:42.625
Can we speak privately?

39:45.713 --> 39:47.547
Well, you may want
to have a seat.

39:48.749 --> 39:51.250
Yeah.

39:55.139 --> 39:56.673
My dad's college roommate
was G. Gordon Liddy...

39:58.392 --> 40:00.059
and he taught my pop
a valuable lesson.

40:00.144 --> 40:02.111
<i>He said the key to any campaign
is digging up dirt</i>

40:02.179 --> 40:04.097
on your opponent,
so I did a little digging.

40:07.067 --> 40:09.068
Dude, my permanent
record has three volumes.

40:09.153 --> 40:11.554
I don't remember
doing half this stuff.

40:13.557 --> 40:15.341
Jackpot.

40:15.409 --> 40:17.443
You moved to Lima
after eighth grade, right?

40:17.528 --> 40:19.479
I transferred from Fairbrook.
That's not a secret.

40:19.546 --> 40:22.081
Well, you must have had
a pretty lousy attendance record

40:22.166 --> 40:22.949
<i>because I called Fairbrook
Middle School</i>

40:23.033 --> 40:23.916
and they didn't have

40:23.984 --> 40:26.269
a record of anyone named Fabray,

40:26.337 --> 40:27.370
which makes sense,

40:27.421 --> 40:28.588
<i>as you actually lived</i>

40:28.672 --> 40:30.123
<i>in an unincorporated part</i>

40:30.190 --> 40:32.458
of Fairbrook Township,
which would have meant

40:32.543 --> 40:34.010
<i>you would have gone
to Belleville Middle School,</i>

40:34.077 --> 40:35.294
not Fairbrook.

40:35.362 --> 40:37.113
So I took a little field trip.

40:37.181 --> 40:38.781
You didn't.
I did.

40:38.849 --> 40:40.133
And you know what?
They didn't have

40:40.217 --> 40:42.352
a record of anyone
named Quinn Fabray, either.

40:42.419 --> 40:44.387
<i>They did, however, have someone
named Lucy Fabray--</i>

40:44.438 --> 40:46.806
Lucy Q. Fabray,

40:46.874 --> 40:48.391
to be exact,

40:48.442 --> 40:50.026
and she looked like this.

40:50.093 --> 40:52.111
You can kind of see
the resemblance

40:52.196 --> 40:55.314
if you look past the nose job
and subtract, eh, 70 pounds.

40:55.399 --> 40:56.599
Stop, okay?

40:59.670 --> 41:00.970
That's me.

41:02.272 --> 41:04.240
My middle name is Quinn.

41:04.291 --> 41:07.943
I stopped going by Lucy because
kids made up a mean nickname.

41:09.129 --> 41:10.279
Juicy Lucy?

41:10.347 --> 41:13.082
Lucy Caboosey.

41:14.668 --> 41:16.502
I hated the way I looked.

41:18.472 --> 41:21.908
I had zits. I was chubby.

41:21.975 --> 41:24.060
I felt terrible about myself.

41:25.946 --> 41:27.213
I didn't have friends.

41:27.281 --> 41:30.032
Nobody would talk to me.

41:30.100 --> 41:34.303
I was the only kid at school who
had to dissect their own frog

41:34.354 --> 41:35.822
because nobody would
be my lab partner.

41:38.208 --> 41:40.460
And then I joined ballet,

41:40.527 --> 41:43.579
lost a little bit of weight,

41:43.647 --> 41:46.249
found out I was athletic,
joined gymnastics,

41:46.316 --> 41:48.818
then cheerleading.

41:48.869 --> 41:50.536
Went on Proactiv for my acne.

41:50.621 --> 41:53.005
And when my dad got transferred

41:53.073 --> 41:56.809
and got a raise, I asked him
if I could get a nose job.

41:56.877 --> 42:00.863
And he said yes.

42:00.931 --> 42:03.850
Then I asked them
to call me Quinn.

42:05.436 --> 42:06.886
So you hate yourself.

42:06.954 --> 42:08.554
No, I love myself.

42:08.639 --> 42:10.089
And that's why I did
all those things.

42:11.792 --> 42:15.528
I've been that girl,
and I'm never going back.

42:15.612 --> 42:18.397
I was a miserable little girl.

42:18.482 --> 42:20.700
And now I'm going
to be prom queen.

42:20.784 --> 42:23.936
Yeah. See, I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

42:24.004 --> 42:26.155
You think everyone's going
to vote for you

42:26.206 --> 42:28.274
because they want
to be like you.

42:28.342 --> 42:30.993
Well, I don't know if they're
going to want to be like you

42:31.044 --> 42:33.296
when they find out
that you're a complete fraud.

42:33.363 --> 42:35.047
What are you going to do?

42:35.132 --> 42:37.133
If I were you,
I'd check the bulletin boards.

43:02.326 --> 43:04.494
Why did you bring me here?

43:04.561 --> 43:05.895
Is there a sale at Claire's?

43:05.946 --> 43:08.080
I brought you here to
knock some sense into you.

43:08.165 --> 43:10.199
You won't listen to me,
you won't listen to Finn.

43:10.250 --> 43:11.868
But you will listen
to Barbra Streisand.

43:13.370 --> 43:14.587
Thanks, Puck. I'll
take it from here.

43:14.671 --> 43:15.922
Nice effort.

43:16.006 --> 43:17.373
But only I can lead
this Barbravention.

43:17.424 --> 43:19.742
Is she here?
No. This is a mall in Ohio.

43:19.793 --> 43:21.093
Look, Rachel, here's the deal.

43:21.178 --> 43:22.411
Do you want to disappoint her?

43:22.462 --> 43:24.246
Who?
Barbra.

43:24.298 --> 43:26.582
Of course not, Kurt.
She's my idol. Okay, if you get

43:26.633 --> 43:28.134
a nose job, then you
will be spitting

43:28.218 --> 43:30.419
on her legacy.
Barbra refused

43:30.470 --> 43:32.254
to believe that beauty
could only be defined

43:32.306 --> 43:34.223
by the blonde, chiseled faces
of Hitchcock's beauties,

43:34.274 --> 43:36.475
so she redefined
what beauty was

43:36.560 --> 43:38.361
and became the biggest
female star in the world.

43:38.428 --> 43:39.979
But what if
I can't be like her?

43:40.063 --> 43:41.430
Isn't she one in a billion?

43:41.481 --> 43:43.299
So are you, Rachel.

43:43.367 --> 43:46.068
And if you let one
misguided societal pressure

43:46.119 --> 43:47.453
make you change
the way you look,

43:47.538 --> 43:49.155
then you won't just
be letting Barbra down,

43:49.239 --> 43:50.573
you'll be letting down
all the little girls

43:50.624 --> 43:52.124
who are going to look at
your beautiful face one day

43:52.209 --> 43:53.543
and see themselves.

43:53.610 --> 43:56.078
You'll be taking away
their inspiration, too.

43:56.129 --> 43:57.613
I thought you'd be hesitant,

43:57.664 --> 43:59.332
which is why I
brought you here.

43:59.416 --> 44:01.717
Perhaps, if my words don't
inspire you, song will.

44:03.119 --> 44:04.971
Go.

44:09.125 --> 44:10.626
What are you doing?

44:28.161 --> 44:30.780

44:30.831 --> 44:32.615

Okay.

46:45.402 --> 46:46.569
So...

46:46.620 --> 46:48.621
Nice and clean.

46:48.705 --> 46:51.574
I'm afraid we're out of time.

46:51.642 --> 46:53.609
What do you mean?
I just sat down.

46:53.660 --> 46:56.395
Well, the therapeutic
hour is 50 minutes,

46:56.463 --> 46:59.015
and you just spent 48 of
them disinfecting the chair.

47:00.584 --> 47:02.668
It's clear you have a...

47:02.736 --> 47:06.439
a fairly severe case of
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

47:06.507 --> 47:08.925
Really?

47:08.976 --> 47:10.843
OCD's very treatable.

47:10.928 --> 47:13.796
A combination of medication
and behavioral therapy

47:13.847 --> 47:16.816
will give you some relief
from those feelings of...

47:16.900 --> 47:18.885
of panic that you might feel

47:18.952 --> 47:21.754
if, say, you think you forgot
to unplug the curling iron or...

47:21.822 --> 47:24.640
Oh, God, I think I forgot
to unplug the curling iron.

47:24.691 --> 47:27.827
There's a stigma in this country

47:27.895 --> 47:29.612
about mental illness.

47:29.680 --> 47:34.684
I mean, depression,
anxiety, OCD, bipolar,

47:34.751 --> 47:37.019
they're hard to diagnose, so...

47:37.087 --> 47:39.956
people don't always appreciate
that they're serious problems,

47:40.007 --> 47:41.040
but they are.

47:43.260 --> 47:45.378
Yeah, um...

47:45.462 --> 47:46.946
I don't know.

47:47.014 --> 47:49.799
You know, I'm not sure
I want to lay on a couch

47:49.850 --> 47:51.934
and tell some stranger
all of my secrets.

47:52.002 --> 47:53.352
And...

47:53.437 --> 47:54.971
I don't want
to start popping pills

47:55.022 --> 47:58.007
just so I can turn into someone
that other people want me to be.

47:59.643 --> 48:02.011
This is how I am.

48:02.079 --> 48:04.564
This is who I'm supposed to be.

48:04.648 --> 48:08.434
Your illness is not
who you're supposed to be.

48:08.502 --> 48:12.355
It's keeping you from who
you're supposed to be.

48:14.190 --> 48:17.210
Look, you're
a guidance counselor, right?

48:17.277 --> 48:21.614
So if a student came to you
and said they had diabetes,

48:21.682 --> 48:24.634
would you give them insulin

48:24.701 --> 48:28.588
or would you say, "Hey, that's
just who you're supposed to be."

48:28.672 --> 48:31.591
I...

48:31.658 --> 48:35.144
I just feel, um...

48:35.211 --> 48:37.346
I feel so ashamed.

48:39.316 --> 48:41.117
Right.

48:41.184 --> 48:42.852
Well, you're not alone.

48:44.438 --> 48:47.607
After my daughter was born,
I had a severe case

48:47.691 --> 48:49.725
of postpartum depression.

48:49.776 --> 48:52.394
I would look down

48:52.446 --> 48:54.396
at this beautiful baby girl

48:54.448 --> 48:56.799
like she wasn't even mine.

48:56.867 --> 49:00.386
Like all the color
just came out of the world.

49:02.706 --> 49:04.239
But you know when the moment was

49:04.291 --> 49:06.208
that I started to feel
just a little bit better?

49:07.961 --> 49:10.713
When I admitted
that I needed some help.

49:10.764 --> 49:12.915
Well...

49:12.966 --> 49:14.267
that's what I'm here for.

49:14.351 --> 49:16.185
Can I tell you something, Emma?

49:17.387 --> 49:19.171
You're going to feel better.

49:19.239 --> 49:22.358
I promise.

49:22.425 --> 49:24.527
I'm going to give you an SSRI.

49:24.594 --> 49:27.196
Start with a low dosage,

49:27.263 --> 49:29.482
and that'll help you
hold on to the serotonin

49:29.566 --> 49:31.033
that your brain
naturally makes anyway.

49:31.101 --> 49:33.402
And I'd like to see
you in about a week.

49:40.827 --> 49:41.877
Hey.

49:41.945 --> 49:43.379
Well, it's over.

49:43.446 --> 49:44.497
What?

49:44.581 --> 49:46.132
My campaign.

49:46.216 --> 49:48.217
I'll never get elected
prom queen now.

49:49.419 --> 49:50.970
Can I show you something?

49:54.891 --> 49:56.759
It's my girlfriend.

49:58.729 --> 50:01.296
I used to have another photo,
but... I like this one better.

50:02.482 --> 50:04.100
Why?

50:04.151 --> 50:07.119
She looks terrible.
You think so?

50:07.187 --> 50:09.388
Mm-hmm.
'Cause I think it's the first one

50:09.456 --> 50:12.074
where you can really see her.

50:21.001 --> 50:23.252
Thank you.

50:23.319 --> 50:25.504
I'll see you in
Glee rehearsal, okay?

50:25.589 --> 50:27.656
She's, like, an inspiration.

50:27.708 --> 50:30.259
One of us.
One who overcame.

50:30.326 --> 50:32.995
I always thought she was just
some kind of stuck-up bitch,

50:33.046 --> 50:34.630
but she's really
one of the people.

50:34.681 --> 50:35.715
Yeah, totally.

50:35.799 --> 50:37.216
Yeah.

50:37.300 --> 50:38.718
Holy crap, it's her.

50:38.802 --> 50:39.769
Totally.

50:39.836 --> 50:41.303
You have our votes, Lucy.

50:41.355 --> 50:42.388
Totally.

50:42.472 --> 50:43.639
Thanks.

50:43.690 --> 50:46.025
I'll try not to let you down.

50:46.109 --> 50:47.843
Jacob Ben Israel's

50:47.894 --> 50:51.147
queen poll has you up by 40%.

50:53.116 --> 50:55.651
I... suppose I...

50:55.702 --> 50:57.703
had that result coming.

50:57.788 --> 50:59.789
It's not cool...

50:59.856 --> 51:02.491
what I did to you,
and I apologize.

51:04.378 --> 51:06.295
I respect you.

51:08.331 --> 51:11.167
I had to get a nose job
and go on a crazy diet

51:11.218 --> 51:13.169
to walk around this
school like I owned it.

51:13.220 --> 51:14.687
And you just do it.

51:18.225 --> 51:21.093
Well, I have to admit...

51:21.178 --> 51:22.812
I have considered.
Going blonde.

51:23.980 --> 51:25.380
I'm not so sure.

51:25.432 --> 51:26.482
Red, maybe.

51:27.651 --> 51:30.052
Ooh, that's a great idea.

51:30.103 --> 51:31.053
Red.

51:32.239 --> 51:33.656
Hey.

51:34.991 --> 51:37.559
Do you like my shirt
for Glee Club?

51:37.611 --> 51:39.495
It's perfect.
I know.

51:39.562 --> 51:41.947
Check out mine.

51:42.032 --> 51:44.200
What? This is perfect.

51:44.251 --> 51:45.868
Legend has it that when
I came out of my mother,

51:45.919 --> 51:47.369
I told the nurse she was fat.

51:47.421 --> 51:49.588
Well...

51:49.673 --> 51:51.406
I made a different one for you.

51:53.460 --> 51:55.094
I'm Hispanic.

51:55.178 --> 51:58.013
Wait, was that supposed
to be "Lesbian"?

51:58.081 --> 51:59.581
Yeah, isn't that what it says?

51:59.633 --> 52:01.267
When you told me all
that stuff the other week,

52:01.351 --> 52:02.384
it meant so much to me.

52:02.436 --> 52:04.253
To see you be so honest.

52:04.304 --> 52:06.305
Especially 'cause I
know how bad it hurt.

52:06.389 --> 52:08.023
I was so proud of you.

52:08.091 --> 52:10.276
Yeah, well,
don't get used to it.

52:10.360 --> 52:11.644
And certainly don't even think
about telling anyone.

52:11.728 --> 52:13.612
Why not?

52:13.697 --> 52:15.397
You're like the most awesomest
girl at this school.

52:15.449 --> 52:17.116
Why would you try to hide any of that?
I'm dating Karofsky now.

52:17.200 --> 52:18.784
It's gross.

52:18.869 --> 52:20.453
You don't get a say
in who I date anymore.

52:20.537 --> 52:22.204
Why not,
because I'm dating somebody?

52:22.272 --> 52:24.490
Because you're Lebanese
and I think I'm bi-curious?

52:24.574 --> 52:28.577
No. Because I said
I love you.

52:28.628 --> 52:29.995
You didn't say
you love me back.

52:30.080 --> 52:32.214
I do love you. Clearly
you don't love you

52:32.282 --> 52:33.632
as much as I do or
you'd put the shirt on

52:33.717 --> 52:35.551
and you would dance with me.

53:06.533 --> 53:07.983
All right, guys.

53:08.034 --> 53:09.118
Listen up.

53:09.169 --> 53:11.253
You all did really good
this week.

53:11.321 --> 53:13.789
It was tough, but I think
we came closer as a team

53:13.840 --> 53:15.157
and I'm proud of you.

53:15.208 --> 53:17.960
And now, I'd like to be
the first one to show off

53:18.011 --> 53:20.262
my custom T-shirt,
revealing something

53:20.330 --> 53:22.348
I was self-conscious about
in the past,

53:22.432 --> 53:25.467
something I was born with,

53:25.519 --> 53:28.220
something I've come to accept
about myself this past week.

53:28.305 --> 53:30.472
So, drumroll, Finn.

53:35.695 --> 53:37.613
I like your chin,
Mr. Shue.

53:37.680 --> 53:39.198
Yeah, I would've went
with "Tears up a lot."

53:39.282 --> 53:40.449
Uh, is everyone here?

53:40.516 --> 53:42.067
Not everybody.

53:42.152 --> 53:44.686
I wanted to thank you guys
for my Barbravention.

53:44.738 --> 53:46.739
And I have
an announcement to make.

53:46.823 --> 53:48.374
I went to my doctor

53:48.458 --> 53:50.075
and...

53:50.160 --> 53:52.077
I canceled my appointment.

53:53.496 --> 53:54.880
And then I went home

53:54.965 --> 53:57.216
and I made this.

53:57.300 --> 53:58.300
Whoa.

54:00.804 --> 54:02.888
So, unfortunately I can't join
in on today's dance number.

54:02.973 --> 54:04.807
My doctor said I have to stay
away from vigorous choreography

54:04.874 --> 54:06.175
while my nose heals.

54:06.226 --> 54:07.977
So thanks for being patient.

54:08.044 --> 54:10.396
And, Finn, next time,

54:10.480 --> 54:12.314
watch out for the schnoz.

54:12.382 --> 54:14.049
Where's Santana?

54:14.100 --> 54:16.569
Probably off somewhere
making out with Karofsky.

54:17.721 --> 54:19.071
Yeah, he can have her.

54:19.155 --> 54:20.522
