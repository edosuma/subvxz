THE DRAGON: In a land of myth
and a time of magic,

00:05.173 --> 00:10.219
the destiny of a great kingdom
rests on the shoulders of a young boy.

00:10.303 --> 00:13.097
His name, Merlin.

(MEN SHOUTING)

00:55.973 --> 00:57.475
Are they still after us?

00:58.559 --> 00:59.894
| told you we'd outrun them.

01:01.229 --> 01:02.563
You sure?

01:03.064 --> 01:05.816
Why is it you never trust me, Merlin?

01:06.567 --> 01:07.860
(MEN SHOUTING)

01:19.830 --> 01:22.124
-Come on. This way.
-Where are we going?

01:22.208 --> 01:23.709
Trust me!

01:30.508 --> 01:31.759
Arthur!

01:33.052 --> 01:35.304
What are you doing? Come on.

01:54.282 --> 01:55.574
What is this place?

01:56.284 --> 01:58.369
The Valley of the Fallen Kings.

02:00.329 --> 02:03.666
-Is it cursed?
-No. Unless you're superstitious.

02:04.709 --> 02:06.711
-It is.
-It's a myth.

02:07.545 --> 02:09.964
They'll never follow us in here.
They won't dare.

02:11.590 --> 02:12.925
Trust me.

02:13.884 --> 02:16.387
If you say that one more time...

02:37.199 --> 02:39.744
-What was that?
-An arrow.

02:39.827 --> 02:43.581
An arrow? Oh, good. For a moment
| thought it was something terrible.

05:04.221 --> 05:06.849
| don't care if you die,
there are plenty of other princes.

05:06.932 --> 05:11.187
You're not the only pompous,
supercilious, condescending

05:11.270 --> 05:13.939
royal imbecile I could work for.

05:14.023 --> 05:15.733
The world is full of them.

But I'm going to give you
one more chance.

Tell me,

06:11.914 --> 06:13.541
why are you so sad?

06:21.632 --> 06:24.468
My friend, he's dying. I can't help him.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.387
Then do not waste your tears.

06:27.638 --> 06:31.225
| can tell you that the time
for him to die is not yet upon us.

06:35.145 --> 06:38.107
Don't be afraid. My name is Taliesin.

06:38.190 --> 06:40.484
-I'm Merlin.
-I know who you are.

06:40.568 --> 06:46.323
The moment of our meeting
has been written for many, many years.

06:47.157 --> 06:48.742
You are Emrys.

07:07.511 --> 07:09.513
-Arthur?
-He is sleeping.

07:09.597 --> 07:11.849
Within hours he will be fully recovered.

07:12.725 --> 07:14.184
You're sure?

07:14.560 --> 07:17.062
-If my memory serves me well.
-What do you mean?

07:18.689 --> 07:20.691
| want to show you something, Merlin.

07:24.862 --> 07:27.114
-What?
-You must wait and see.

07:34.455 --> 07:36.248
Where are we going?

07:37.374 --> 07:39.460
Why have you brought me here?

07:39.543 --> 07:42.880
In good time you will discover all.

07:43.339 --> 07:44.757
(CHUCKLES)

08:08.781 --> 08:10.157
What is this place?

08:10.240 --> 08:12.743
This is where magic began.

08:14.244 --> 08:16.246
It is the Crystal Cave.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.107
-What is it you see?
-Images, flashes.

08:45.693 --> 08:49.154
I've seen something like this
before in the Crystal of Neahtid.

08:49.238 --> 08:51.323
What you see here is exactly the same,

08:51.407 --> 08:55.411
for the Crystal of Neahtid
was hewn from this very cave.

08:57.788 --> 09:01.208
Look into them, Emrys, really look.

09:03.460 --> 09:04.878
Much will be revealed.

09:14.638 --> 09:15.889
No.

09:16.306 --> 09:18.434
Take me out of here.

09:19.935 --> 09:21.270
How do I get back to Arthur?

09:21.353 --> 09:24.356
The future is hidden to all
but a very few, Emrys.

09:24.648 --> 09:28.861
-You are one such person.
-No. I've been through this before.

09:29.111 --> 09:32.990
Perhaps there is a reason you were
brought here at this moment in time.

09:34.950 --> 09:37.494
-What reason?
-Only the crystals can tell you.

09:39.037 --> 09:41.165
They contain futures
that are not yet born.

09:41.707 --> 09:47.379
The secrets they reveal, Emrys,
are unique to you and you alone.

09:48.505 --> 09:49.840
Look into them, Emrys.

09:50.549 --> 09:52.050
Really look.

09:53.719 --> 09:56.138
Use what you see for good.

(GRUNTS)

11:41.201 --> 11:42.995
What was that?

11:55.215 --> 11:56.967
You look like a startled stoat.

11:57.092 --> 12:01.847
Yeah? Well, at least I don't
look like a bone idle toad.

12:02.472 --> 12:03.849
Let's go.

12:04.141 --> 12:05.601
Are you saying I look like a toad?

12:05.684 --> 12:08.979
Yeah, maybe one day you'll magically
transform into a handsome prince.

12:10.022 --> 12:12.024
Since magic's outlawed,
that'll probably never happen.

12:12.107 --> 12:14.067
-Come on, let's go.
-Merlin.

12:14.943 --> 12:15.986
What?

12:17.029 --> 12:19.281
I'm the one who gives the orders.
Remember?

12:19.990 --> 12:20.991
Yeah.

12:22.951 --> 12:24.369
You ready? Let's go.

12:28.040 --> 12:31.376
| don't understand.
You said I had an arrow in my back.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.921
How come all I can feel
is a slight bruise?

12:34.004 --> 12:36.465
-Don't know.
-Merlin.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.260
Did something happen
you're not telling me about?

12:40.344 --> 12:41.386
No.

12:44.056 --> 12:47.267
Come on. I'm missing your usual prattle.

12:47.351 --> 12:48.769
You're certainly making up for it.

12:52.022 --> 12:53.690
You still haven't answered my question.

12:55.233 --> 12:56.443
The arrow didn't pierce your armor,

12:56.526 --> 12:58.362
and when you fell
you knocked yourself out.

13:02.741 --> 13:03.951
All right.

13:04.660 --> 13:09.081
| don't normally say things like this,
but you did a good job back there.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.212
Did you hear what I just said?

13:17.673 --> 13:20.467
All right, maybe I should give you
some kind of reward. What do you want?

13:20.550 --> 13:22.427
Some peace and quiet.

13:25.639 --> 13:28.433
The bandits probably have a stronghold
somewhere in the White Mountains.

13:28.517 --> 13:30.686
How we escaped, I'll never know.

13:31.228 --> 13:34.106
Although some credit
must go to my servant, Merlin.

13:34.648 --> 13:37.150
Dispatch a patrol, I want these
men caught and brought to justice.

13:37.234 --> 13:38.402
Immediately, Father.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.613
For a moment we feared you might miss
Lady Morgana's birthday.

13:41.697 --> 13:44.241
It would take more than a bunch of
thieves to keep me from such a feast.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.118
Tomorrow promises to be quite a night.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.581
Gaius, I can't get these visions
out of my head.

13:52.374 --> 13:56.044
You are extremely lucky
to have seen the Crystal Cave.

13:57.087 --> 13:58.714
Even before the Great Purge,

13:58.797 --> 14:01.508
wizards would talk about it
with reverence.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.760
That man who led me there, who is he?

14:05.053 --> 14:06.638
(SCOFFS) Who was he?

14:06.722 --> 14:09.224
He died, I'd say, about 300 years ago.

14:10.809 --> 14:14.438
Taliesin was a seer
to the great kings of old.

14:15.522 --> 14:19.359
It is said that the Crystal Cave
was the source of his prophecies.

14:20.944 --> 14:22.821
He told me.

14:25.115 --> 14:28.702
He said there was a reason I was
brought there at this moment in time.

14:29.286 --> 14:30.454
Why?

14:30.954 --> 14:34.207
It must mean
the events I saw are imminent.

14:34.958 --> 14:36.585
Morgana is going to kill Uther.

14:38.128 --> 14:41.757
Merlin, you must be careful.
The crystals are treacherous.

14:43.133 --> 14:45.302
What you saw may not be
all that it seemed.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.678
So I do nothing?

14:46.762 --> 14:50.390
There is nothing to suggest that
what you saw is imminent, is there?

14:52.809 --> 14:53.894
No.

14:53.977 --> 14:57.064
So, I wouldn't let it
put you off your soup.

14:57.147 --> 14:58.648
No, you're right.

14:59.316 --> 15:01.568
-Come on, eat up.
-What is it?

15:02.569 --> 15:04.529
Sometimes it's best not to know.

15:14.164 --> 15:17.084
-You're up.
-It's Morgana's birthday.

15:17.167 --> 15:19.503
-I have to get her a present.
-What are you getting her?

15:19.586 --> 15:22.005
-It's a secret.
-Come on, you can tell me.

15:23.340 --> 15:24.633
A dagger.

15:37.354 --> 15:38.855
(NEIGHING)

15:52.285 --> 15:56.373
It's happening!
The future I saw, it's started.

15:56.456 --> 15:57.791
Calm down, Merlin.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.918
| just saw Morgana struggling
with a horse

16:00.001 --> 16:01.378
exactly as she was in the crystals.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.255
-Are you certain?
-It was the same image.

16:03.338 --> 16:04.631
But she's always riding.

16:04.714 --> 16:07.008
It's not unusual
to see her with a horse.

16:07.092 --> 16:08.468
It's not the only thing.

16:09.803 --> 16:12.848
Arthur's present for Morgana,
he's told me it's a dagger.

16:12.973 --> 16:14.057
A dagger?

16:14.724 --> 16:18.520
Merlin, I think you're overreacting.
It could be any dagger.

16:18.979 --> 16:20.814
As for the sight of Morgana
with a horse...

16:20.897 --> 16:23.066
-It was the same.
-It's hardly a rare sight.

16:23.567 --> 16:27.028
It's certainly not one to be trusted
as a harbinger of doom.

16:31.616 --> 16:32.868
(DOOR OPENS)

16:34.452 --> 16:38.248
Ah, Merlin.
Have you done my clothes for the feast?

16:39.124 --> 16:40.333
Ah! No.

16:40.417 --> 16:42.586
No. No. Well, what have you been doing?

16:44.421 --> 16:46.590
-Um...
-Hmm?

16:48.466 --> 16:52.262
Right, well, you can start
by pressing my robe,

16:52.345 --> 16:57.100
and, uh, cleaning my shirts
and, ooh, polishing my boots.

17:01.855 --> 17:04.691
Ah, Morgana's present.
What do you think?

17:11.489 --> 17:14.659
Beautiful, isn't it? Feel the balance.

17:14.742 --> 17:17.162
Feel the sharpness of the blade.

17:22.709 --> 17:26.796
Yeah, it's just what
every woman wants, isn't it?

17:28.924 --> 17:29.925
What do you mean?

17:30.008 --> 17:32.260
Well, I'm no expert, but don't women
normally go for pretty things,

17:32.344 --> 17:33.637
like, maybe, jewelry?

17:39.309 --> 17:40.810
How do I look?

17:43.021 --> 17:44.439
Same as you always do.

17:45.315 --> 17:46.650
Handsome?

17:46.816 --> 17:48.109
You've brightened up.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.572
-I've seen Morgana's present.
-The dagger?

17:52.989 --> 17:54.908
It's very plain, bit boring.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.451
And not like the one you saw?

17:56.534 --> 17:59.996
No, that was sumptuous, ornate.

18:00.330 --> 18:02.916
I'd probably be disappointed
if I were Morgana.

18:02.999 --> 18:05.210
Good, so now you can stop worrying.

18:05.293 --> 18:08.338
Oh, I have. I'm going to continue
as if I'd never even met Taliesin.

18:11.508 --> 18:13.301
I'm going to enjoy this feast
like everyone else.

18:13.385 --> 18:14.844
Even if it's for Morgana.

18:20.684 --> 18:22.560
ALL: To Lady Morgana.

but this is one of those rare occasions.

19:11.192 --> 19:14.487
Girls do like pretty things. Thanks.

19:17.782 --> 19:21.328
Don't you see? It's started.
It's coming true.

19:21.661 --> 19:22.912
We can't be certain about that.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.998
-We have to stop her.
-How?

19:25.081 --> 19:26.666
Merlin, we don't know
when this is going to happen.

19:26.750 --> 19:28.335
We don't even know if it will.

Mainly hairbrushes.

Who is King Gromause?

20:13.171 --> 20:15.298
At least he doesn't think
my hair needs brushing.

20:16.174 --> 20:17.801
It's so pretty.

20:19.427 --> 20:20.720
Here. I want you to have this.

-Dianthus?

Yes, and a preparation of pulmonaria.

ground fine, and mixed with violet.

If Gaius could do something, he would.

25:22.772 --> 25:27.652

And to lose her now, like this.

She's like a sister to me.

Sire, but...

-You're not understanding me, Gaius.

26:38.806 --> 26:41.726
In all these books

Something in the Old Religion?

-Are you suggesting...
-Sorcery, yes.

26:57.366 --> 26:59.952

to risk everything for Morgana.

27:03.623 --> 27:07.084
Gaius, you don't understand.

27:10.213 --> 27:12.757
There's something you should know.

27:14.050 --> 27:16.219
Something I've told no one.

27:21.432 --> 27:23.142
Morgana is my daughter.

27:26.103 --> 27:30.566
It was whilst Gorlois was away.
He was fighting in the Northern Plains.

27:32.944 --> 27:36.447
Her mother, Vivienne,

27:50.002 --> 27:51.712
I've said enough.

You are Gaius' boy?

28:48.686 --> 28:50.438
He is my guardian.

28:50.771 --> 28:51.898
You are like a son to him.

-Yes.

It does not surprise me.

31:29.430 --> 31:30.514
But I stopped her.

31:30.639 --> 31:34.143
To change the future
is no simple matter, Merlin.

To do so is fraught with danger.

my actions, Morgana is dying.
