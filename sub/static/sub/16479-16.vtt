Valentine's Day!

00:03.804 --> 00:04.837
SCHMIDT:

00:13.848 --> 00:16.281
Oh, hey, what you doing?
We wasn't doing nothing!
Hey! Oh!

00:16.283 --> 00:17.683
I love the "Cupid Shuffle."
Why'd you stop?

00:17.685 --> 00:19.385
'Cause, uh...
This particular day...

00:19.387 --> 00:21.553
Yeah, it's, like,
romantic in nature.

00:21.555 --> 00:25.457
Ugh, that stupid "sad single
girl on Valentine's Day" cliché?

00:25.459 --> 00:26.658
Do better.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.160
I have a great day planned.

00:28.162 --> 00:29.561
I'm finally gonna use

00:29.563 --> 00:32.364
the celebrity chef dinner
that I won at the auction.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.900
And before that,
I'm gonna clean out my purse.

00:34.902 --> 00:37.469
Dinner by yourself
and cleaning out your purse?

00:37.471 --> 00:38.303
Does that sound sad?

00:38.305 --> 00:39.571
Mm-hmm.
Yes.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.306
Oh, kiss it.
It's gonna be great.

00:41.308 --> 00:42.875
Hey, is there anything in there
from Reagan?

00:42.877 --> 00:45.711
She's in Minnesota,
and we're exchanging gifts.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.746
Gonna do the old stand-by,
like when we were dating?

00:47.748 --> 00:50.916
A nudie card
with a $20 stapled to it?

00:50.918 --> 00:53.485
I did so good.

00:53.487 --> 00:56.722
No, no, no, I'm-I'm putting
a real effort this year.

00:56.724 --> 00:59.091
I feel five feet tall.

00:59.093 --> 01:00.259
You're more than
five feet right now.

01:00.261 --> 01:01.727
I feel smaller
because I'm humbled.

01:01.729 --> 01:04.163
I'm humbled by
my actions of tenderness.

01:04.165 --> 01:07.566
Well, the only Valentine
in this pile is for yours truly.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.003
Someone very crafty made it.

01:11.005 --> 01:12.871
She sent a Valentine's
to herself.

01:12.873 --> 01:15.107
Now, you understand this
is sad, this is really sad.

01:15.109 --> 01:16.742
Guys, would a sad person
do this?

Can't believe

01:33.794 --> 01:35.861

Day together.

01:35.863 --> 01:37.196
I know. It sucks.
The first year

01:37.198 --> 01:38.697
that I haven't planned
our bone-iversary.

01:38.699 --> 01:39.865
I think I'd prefer to call it

01:39.867 --> 01:41.567
the anniversary of
the first night we made love.

01:41.569 --> 01:43.602
Either way, it's our first
one as a married couple.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.404
You know, we miss this,
the next thing you know,

01:45.406 --> 01:46.738
we're making
love once a year

01:46.740 --> 01:48.740
next to a Thomas Kinkade
painting after a hot dog dinner.

01:48.742 --> 01:50.375
It's not your fault,
all right?

01:50.377 --> 01:52.744
You've just been
working so hard.

01:52.746 --> 01:55.614
I've been killing myself
trying to impress Kim.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.749
Call the tween footwear people.
Here's their number.

01:57.751 --> 01:59.985
Don't trouble yourself.
I've got it memorized.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.127
You just dialed

02:08.129 --> 02:09.128
17 numbers.

02:09.130 --> 02:10.429
Loretta, I need you!

02:10.431 --> 02:11.497
Freakin' Loretta!

02:12.900 --> 02:14.433
Kim will take you seriously

02:14.435 --> 02:16.935
when she sees you
in that fine-ass suit.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.670
Ah, thank you.
(chuckles)

02:18.672 --> 02:20.739
How long have we been
waiting for this elevator?

02:20.741 --> 02:22.741
What, are we in the lobby
of Sterling Cooper?

02:22.743 --> 02:24.943
Hey, hey.
What you doing?

02:24.945 --> 02:26.812
Cleaning out your purse? Fun.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.580
Mind if I watch?

02:28.582 --> 02:30.916
Knock yourself out.

02:30.918 --> 02:31.850
(chuckles) Whoo!

02:31.852 --> 02:33.619
What you got there?

02:33.621 --> 02:34.820
That a nail clipper?

02:34.822 --> 02:36.989
What you gonna
do with that?

02:36.991 --> 02:39.024
Keep, throw away.
Keep, throw away.

02:39.026 --> 02:40.425
(mumbling)

02:40.427 --> 02:41.994
I'm going with keep,
I'm going...

02:41.996 --> 02:43.428
Oh! She's keeping it!

02:43.430 --> 02:44.997
Oh, I get it--
you think I'm sad.

02:44.999 --> 02:47.099
Aren't you supposed to be
with your girlfriend right now?

02:47.101 --> 02:48.433
Aly's not big on V-Day.

02:48.435 --> 02:49.868
What?
Yeah.

02:49.870 --> 02:51.170
She says it makes her
want to eat

02:51.172 --> 02:52.971
and successfully pass a nail.

02:52.973 --> 02:54.840
Yeah. I love her so much.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.141
And aren't you
gonna propose to her?

02:56.143 --> 02:58.210
Yeah, I am, in due time.
But right now,

02:58.212 --> 03:01.180
I'm only on phase six
of my 21-step proposal plan.

03:01.182 --> 03:02.181
I'm months away.

03:02.183 --> 03:03.448
And in case you were wondering

03:03.450 --> 03:05.284
if I'm under budget, I am not.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.119
By thousands of dollars.

03:07.121 --> 03:08.654
Winston, no matter
what Aly says,

03:08.656 --> 03:10.522
all girls love Valentine's Day.

03:10.524 --> 03:14.293
Get your cupcake ass out of here
and go make her feel special.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.561
I can't miss this.

03:15.563 --> 03:17.129
Leave me to my froyo cards.

03:17.131 --> 03:19.698
God, I got to start going
to the same place, you know.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.833
Or else I'll never
get a free one.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.669
(door opens, closes)

03:23.671 --> 03:25.003
Oh.

03:25.005 --> 03:26.705
I'm alone.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.074
I can't even imagine

03:29.076 --> 03:30.742
what Reagan got me.

03:30.744 --> 03:33.345
'Cause I know she went,
you know, at least as hard

03:33.347 --> 03:35.714
as I went, and I got
to say, I went hard.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.716
At 11:00, an
11-ounce steak

03:37.718 --> 03:39.551
will be sent to her room.
That's large.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.687
At 12:00, a single
rose will arrive.

03:41.689 --> 03:44.089
At 1:00, the hotel
manager is gonna come,

03:44.091 --> 03:46.225
he's gonna tell her there's
a problem with her room,

03:46.227 --> 03:47.826
he's gonna take her
to another room.

03:47.828 --> 03:50.862
When she walks in that room,
boom, it's filled with roses.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.764
Damn, son.
It's a slightly worse room,

03:52.766 --> 03:54.533
but it's right near
an ice machine.

03:54.535 --> 03:56.702
I am proud of you.
You're a real Big Boy Cupid.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.537
Big Boy Cupid--
I like that.

03:58.539 --> 04:00.505
Say it again.
Big Boy Cupid!

04:00.507 --> 04:02.874
I didn't like it
that much that time.

04:02.876 --> 04:05.210
Well, I'm very happy for you
on your Valentine's Day.

04:05.212 --> 04:07.279
Doesn't really feel like
Valentine's Day to me.

04:07.281 --> 04:10.682
Schmidt didn't get to plan
our bone-iversary this year.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.551
If he is too busy to
plan the bone-iversary,

04:12.553 --> 04:13.885
then you've got to do it.

04:13.887 --> 04:16.288
Okay. Sure, I guess
I could step up my game.

04:16.290 --> 04:17.856
Right? Good.
Right, yeah.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.458
Okay, I'll try it, I'll do it.

04:19.460 --> 04:20.759
That is some good advice.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.194
Now my final
bit of advice,

04:22.196 --> 04:24.029
and don't get
sensitive on this,

04:24.031 --> 04:26.198
but you got to change
that top-- it's terrible.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.766
And you got to
throw sparkles on.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.701
I think...
Sparkles are in.

04:29.703 --> 04:30.702
I think my top is fine.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.204
Sparkles are in!
There's a line.

04:32.206 --> 04:35.807
You giving me fashion advice
is the line.
Sparkles are in!

04:35.809 --> 04:37.776
(laughs)
Look, I know it's not much,

04:37.778 --> 04:39.294
but, um, you know,

04:39.295 --> 04:40.811
I just thought it would be nice
to spend some...

04:40.814 --> 04:43.048
koala-ty time together.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.650
Ew.
(Australian accent):
G'Day, mate.

04:44.652 --> 04:46.551
Oh, no.
What's a fit Sheila like you

04:46.553 --> 04:48.053
doing with this sticky joey?

04:48.055 --> 04:49.788
You were right.
I said I didn't want

04:49.790 --> 04:51.623
to do anything today,
but this is pretty fun.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.760
(British accent): Even though
you forgot the Parmesan cheese.

04:54.762 --> 04:55.961
Well, that's not what
he would sound like.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.896
I mean, if you're gonna
say it, you might as well

04:57.898 --> 04:58.930
say it the way he would...

04:58.932 --> 05:00.832
(both laugh)

05:00.834 --> 05:04.603
I can't even joke be mad at you,
because you're so perfect.

05:04.605 --> 05:07.072
Well, you're the most ridiculous
person I've ever met.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.807
(laughs)
But, you know,

05:08.809 --> 05:10.942
I honestly never
get tired of you.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.077
(chuckles)

05:12.079 --> 05:13.912
Okay, this is
gonna sound crazy,

05:13.914 --> 05:15.681
but I don't even care,
I'm just gonna say it.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.249
Why don't we get married?

05:17.251 --> 05:18.317
(laughs)

05:24.792 --> 05:28.026
Nah...

05:28.028 --> 05:29.695
(grunts)
You said no?

05:29.697 --> 05:31.697
I have a proposal<i> plan,</i> okay?

05:31.699 --> 05:33.465
A plan. You know what,
and I would not be

05:33.467 --> 05:35.534
in this mess if it wasn't
for you convincing me

05:35.536 --> 05:37.269
to do Valentine's Day
in the first place!

05:37.271 --> 05:39.171
I'm sorry, I'm just--

05:39.173 --> 05:41.206
You know what, I'll just
find her at work, okay?

05:41.208 --> 05:42.708
And I'll-I'll
tell her yes then.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.109
I'm used to
compromising my dreams.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.877
No, Winston, you deserve
an amazing engagement.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.779
You're America's sweetheart,

05:47.781 --> 05:50.315
and you have to give Aly
the proposal she deserves.

05:50.317 --> 05:51.850
And you have to do it today,

05:51.852 --> 05:53.118
'cause she's probably
freaking out right now.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.886
It's a 21-step plan.

05:54.888 --> 05:56.621
I can't do it in one night.

05:56.623 --> 05:58.890
You can't, but we can.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.225
Jess, I can't
make you do that.

06:00.227 --> 06:01.860
I mean, you had a
whole day planned.

06:01.862 --> 06:04.229
I mean, it's a day I maintain
was rooted in sadness.

06:04.231 --> 06:06.531
You say I'm sad one more time,
and I'm gonna take you

06:06.533 --> 06:08.700
to San Francisco, and we're
gonna eat a little sourdough,

06:08.702 --> 06:10.969
maybe a little crab,
and then I'm gonna throw you

06:10.971 --> 06:12.404
off the Golden Gate Bridge!

06:12.406 --> 06:14.139
Do you understand?
Yes, ma'am.

06:14.141 --> 06:16.007
Now, you go tell that
son of a bitch cat of yours

06:16.009 --> 06:17.376
that he's gonna get a new mommy,

06:17.378 --> 06:18.877
'cause we're gonna
propose tonight!
Okay.

06:23.250 --> 06:25.083
Okay, let's cut
this 21-stage plan

06:25.085 --> 06:27.152
down to the essentials.
Okay.

06:27.154 --> 06:28.920
Great binder, by the way.
You get it at Captain Work?

06:28.922 --> 06:30.355
You know it.
Downtown or Third Street?

06:30.357 --> 06:32.557
Downtown.
Good. Third Street's for idiots.

06:32.559 --> 06:33.692
I'm really loving your vibe
right now.

06:33.694 --> 06:34.926
You're really taking control.

06:34.928 --> 06:37.863
Yeah. Uh, okay,
Malibu cactus picnic. Did that.

06:37.865 --> 06:39.331
Erotic skywriting. That's a cut.

06:39.333 --> 06:40.899
Mm. See, I'm not sure
if you understood...

06:40.901 --> 06:42.434
I know what
erotic skywriting is.

06:42.436 --> 06:43.769
It's in the sky.

06:43.771 --> 06:45.537
Special performance
by the L.A. Children's Choir?

06:45.539 --> 06:48.407
They're gonna come out all cute
and small, singing "Alison."

06:48.409 --> 06:49.541
We're cutting.
Huh?

06:49.543 --> 06:51.376
Okay, we can't get
your ring in Atlanta.

06:51.378 --> 06:53.745
It's the most affordable
big city in America, so...

06:53.747 --> 06:55.947
Well, I have a local ring guy,
so it's Cut-lanta.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.682
(sighs)
Operation Bobcat?

06:57.684 --> 06:59.918
Let's call that
"Operation Cut Cat."
No, no, no, no.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.853
Oh, I should
have said "Bob<i> Cut."</i>

07:01.855 --> 07:03.188
Next time.

07:03.190 --> 07:05.424
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no. Move your hand.

07:05.426 --> 07:08.260
Don't rip that. When Aly and I
were first partners, we got

07:08.262 --> 07:12.230
called to break up a drug deal
in a bus station bathroom.

07:12.232 --> 07:14.232
When we got there,
wasn't nobody in there.

07:14.234 --> 07:16.301
Just a bobcat.

07:16.303 --> 07:18.770
Like, a bobcat
running around.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.106
I shrieked. Of course,
I was afraid for my life.

07:21.108 --> 07:24.409
But Aly-- she, she just
laughed. (chuckles)

07:24.411 --> 07:27.245
Laughed and laughed
and laughed.

07:27.247 --> 07:29.714
And, you know, it was that
moment that made me realize

07:29.716 --> 07:32.551
I wanted to make her laugh
for the rest of her life.

07:32.553 --> 07:35.253
And so, the plan

07:35.255 --> 07:38.123
was to recreate that moment.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.325
So...

07:43.897 --> 07:46.898
You already have
a bobcat costume, don't you?

07:46.900 --> 07:48.567
I'm an oddball romantic.

07:48.569 --> 07:50.869
You bought a bobcat costume
before you got a ring?

07:52.139 --> 07:54.673
You really toe the line
between sweetness and insanity.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.007
That's the whole thing.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.476
SCHMIDT:<i> I already</i>
<i> e-mailed you the reports,</i>

07:57.478 --> 08:00.445
but I know you love hard copies,
and I love that about you.

08:00.447 --> 08:01.513
Why?

08:01.515 --> 08:03.582
Why?

08:03.584 --> 08:04.683
All right.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.485
Happy bone-iver...

08:08.489 --> 08:10.322
So, actually, I'm going to, uh,
double-check those hard copies,

08:10.324 --> 08:12.824
and I'm gonna bring them to you,
'cause I want to make sure

08:12.826 --> 08:14.359
that they're ready
for your brilliant eyes.

08:20.767 --> 08:22.501
Cece, what the hell
are you doing in here?

08:22.503 --> 08:24.536
Surprise!
(pictures clattering)

08:24.538 --> 08:26.972
Cece, I love
where your head's at.

08:26.974 --> 08:28.173
Mm-hmm.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.208
And I love where your body
is at even more,

08:30.210 --> 08:31.543
but I-I can't.

08:31.545 --> 08:34.145
What if I told you
that I have the Star of David

08:34.147 --> 08:37.048
hidden somewhere
on my body,

08:37.050 --> 08:39.050
and you have to find it?
Okay. Okay.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.886
All right, let's do it.

08:40.888 --> 08:41.887
But we got to do it
really quick.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.188
I'm gonna stay dressed and just

08:43.190 --> 08:44.456
poke out like a cuckoo clock.

08:44.458 --> 08:46.191
Not here.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.726
I got a whole thing planned.

08:47.728 --> 08:49.794
(chuckles)

08:49.796 --> 08:50.829
Happy bone-iversary.

08:50.831 --> 08:51.863
(chuckles)

08:51.865 --> 08:54.399
Who would have thought
the first moment

08:54.401 --> 08:56.167
that we ever were intimate
with each other, you know?

08:56.169 --> 08:58.737
Honey, we're on the clock here,
and it's getting very cold,

08:58.739 --> 09:00.572
so why don't we get
this car started.

09:00.574 --> 09:01.907
(wind whistling)

09:01.909 --> 09:03.808
(chuckles)

09:04.578 --> 09:06.211
Oh!
No, no, no!

09:06.213 --> 09:07.679
Oh! What?!
My executive ensemble!

09:07.681 --> 09:08.813
BOTH:
No, no, no!

09:08.815 --> 09:10.682
(grunts)

09:10.684 --> 09:12.884
Thank you for coming, Trevlo.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.386
Hey, got to sell these rings.

09:14.388 --> 09:17.088
Driving towards success.
We blessed.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.990
You're always
so positive, Trevlo.

09:18.992 --> 09:21.660
Got to stay positive.
Stay blessed.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.194
Stay blessed.
Yeah, blessings.

09:23.196 --> 09:25.030
(whispers):
Blessings raining down on you.

09:25.032 --> 09:28.300
Oh. I think, we got one, Trevlo!

09:28.869 --> 09:30.702
$12,000?

09:30.704 --> 09:32.771
You out of your damn mind, man?
No, no, no.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.873
You got to work with me, Trevlo.
Can't do it, baby.

09:34.875 --> 09:35.941
Come on, Jess, you told me
this dude was your friend.

09:35.943 --> 09:37.409
Friend is a stretch.
I rear-ended him

09:37.411 --> 09:39.110
in a drive-thru,
and he gave me his card.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.245
Blessings.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.846
What?!
What?!

09:41.848 --> 09:43.081
What the hell you do
to my fade, Jess?!

09:43.083 --> 09:44.683
I said a soft blend! Soft!

09:44.685 --> 09:46.751
I think it looks great, baby.
It's all your perception.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.920
I look like if LeBron James
turned around.
Calm down.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.689
Look, I'm trying
to stay calm, Jess,

09:50.691 --> 09:53.124
but I'm trying to fit
a 21-step plan into three hours.

09:53.126 --> 09:55.727
Stay blessed.
I swear I'm gonna shove one
of those blessings right up...

09:55.729 --> 09:57.862
Trevlo! I thought that was you!

09:57.864 --> 09:59.531
Wow, look at you. Looking trim.

09:59.533 --> 10:01.299
Been counting my steps, baby.

10:01.301 --> 10:03.435
You know Trevlo, too?
Yeah, I was in the car
when Jess hit him.

10:03.437 --> 10:04.769
Stay blessed.
Stay blessed.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.271
Stay blessed.
Everybody stay blessed.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.406
Stay blessed.
Anyway, Schmidt's having

10:08.408 --> 10:09.975
a Valentine's Day emergency,

10:09.977 --> 10:11.977
and he called on
Big Boy Cupid for help.

10:11.979 --> 10:14.813
Cece's been calling me
Big Boy Cupid

10:14.815 --> 10:16.081
because I'm super romantic now.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.816
What can I say? I'm in love.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.653
TREVLO: Nick, you in love?
Tell me about her.

10:21.655 --> 10:23.421
Is she positive?

10:23.423 --> 10:25.323
She is<i> not</i> positive,
but I can't wait to see

10:25.325 --> 10:26.891
what she got me for
Valentine's Day.

10:26.893 --> 10:28.560
You know what?

10:28.562 --> 10:30.662
Can't do it.
The proposal is off.

10:30.664 --> 10:32.397
What?!
I feel like
I'm being a bad friend

10:32.399 --> 10:33.932
by putting you in this spot.
What spot?

10:33.934 --> 10:36.468
Jess, I saw your face
when Nick said he was in love.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.470
Didn't have a face.
Yeah, you're sad.

10:38.472 --> 10:41.640
I'm not sad. Please, everyone,
stop telling me I'm sad!

10:41.642 --> 10:42.941
A proposal is the last thing
that you should be doing.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.809
I'm calling it.
Come on!

10:44.811 --> 10:46.845
We don't have a ring, we're
rushing through all the steps.

10:46.847 --> 10:47.846
It's better this way.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.514
I'll come up
with a plan B,

10:49.516 --> 10:51.349
I'll make it up to her
for Valentine's Day.

10:51.351 --> 10:52.651
You got to take care
of yourself.

10:52.653 --> 10:53.685
I feel very, very happy.

10:53.687 --> 10:55.420
Stay home, relax.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.689
Have your meal
with your private chef,

10:57.691 --> 10:59.824
and more than anything...

10:59.826 --> 11:00.925
stay blessed.

11:00.927 --> 11:02.460
Don't tell me to stay blessed.

11:02.462 --> 11:03.662
<i> You</i> stay blessed!

11:03.664 --> 11:05.530
♪ Stay blessed! ♪

11:09.870 --> 11:11.836
You know, it's still
our bone-iversary.
I'm too stressed.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.171
Sex right now would be like

11:13.173 --> 11:15.507
picking a lock
with a cold, wet French fry.

11:16.443 --> 11:17.509
Nick. Nick!
What?

11:17.511 --> 11:19.377
(whistles, caws)

11:19.379 --> 11:20.845
Nick! Finally.
Nick!

11:20.847 --> 11:22.180
I couldn't see you.
This thing was blocking me.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.848
Loretta's probably
running the company by now.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.050
Get over here!
Sorry I'm late.

11:25.052 --> 11:26.885
There was a TV crew by
the Staples Center, so I had to

11:26.887 --> 11:28.453
jump around behind the guy
to get on TV, but the good news,

11:28.455 --> 11:30.021
I got on TV, so I think
I'm gonna be on the news.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.656
Great.
What do you got?

11:31.658 --> 11:33.324
Here, I got this for you, man.
You got some pants.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.894
Got a suit jacket.
You brought that suit?!

11:35.896 --> 11:39.130
It's a 62 short. I wore that
to college graduation.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.131
It was in your closet!

11:40.133 --> 11:42.567
As motivation!

11:42.569 --> 11:45.370
Here you go, Cece.
It's a beautiful dress.
My wedding dress?!

11:45.372 --> 11:47.305
Ah, it's your wedding dress?
I knew it looked familiar.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.240
'Cause you were at the wedding!
You're a buffoon idiot.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.342
Oh, my God, it's Kim.
It's Kim. It's Kim. Shh.

11:51.344 --> 11:52.544
Shh, shh.

11:54.514 --> 11:56.981
(crying)

11:56.983 --> 11:59.851
This is the start
of a very long cry.

11:59.853 --> 12:02.721
As a bartender, you really
get to know the human cry.

12:02.723 --> 12:04.823
(continues crying)

12:06.660 --> 12:08.893
(sighs) So what else is
going on with you guys?

12:12.532 --> 12:13.765
(food sizzling)

12:23.276 --> 12:26.177
So is it just you?

12:26.179 --> 12:27.779
Yup.

12:27.781 --> 12:30.515
You know I'm quite famous,
and you didn't want anybody else

12:30.517 --> 12:32.417
to experience my food?
No.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.352
Just me. Just my day.

12:34.354 --> 12:37.088
Are you sad 'cause you're on
your own on Valentine's night?

12:37.090 --> 12:39.657
Ugh! Don't you start with me,
Gordon Ramsay!

12:40.627 --> 12:42.627
I'm having just a great time.

12:42.629 --> 12:43.762
Liar!

12:43.764 --> 12:44.963
Sorry.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.631
Bad habit.

12:46.633 --> 12:47.732
Just bring me
the scallops, please.

12:47.734 --> 12:49.100
Impatient.

12:51.037 --> 12:52.670
Mmm. Delicious.

12:55.142 --> 12:57.642
Scallops.

12:57.644 --> 12:58.877
Aren't...

12:58.879 --> 13:00.645
(dish shatters)
...for liars.

13:01.748 --> 13:03.548
Why are you sad?
I'm not sad.

13:03.550 --> 13:04.649
Then what are you?

13:04.651 --> 13:05.884
I'm mad!

13:05.886 --> 13:07.118
There it is.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.421
I'm mad that Nick just decided
to be a great boyfriend.

13:10.423 --> 13:12.056
Where does all this effort
come from?

13:12.058 --> 13:15.460
Reagan gets Mr. Cupid, and
I got, like, some nudie card.

13:15.462 --> 13:18.229
This bread is incredible.
You taste the crust?

13:18.231 --> 13:20.431
It's really good. And you know
what else pisses me off?

13:20.433 --> 13:22.066
The fact that everyone
thinks I'm sad.

13:22.068 --> 13:24.836
I mean, Winston canceled
his engagement 'cause of it.

13:24.838 --> 13:26.504
Then bloody
do something about it!

13:27.808 --> 13:30.675
Brilliant! Uh, just a reminder:
I'm not required to clean up.

13:30.677 --> 13:32.644
Winston can't throw away
his dreams because of me!

13:32.646 --> 13:34.579
Then don't let him.

13:34.581 --> 13:36.815
Hey, Jess, what's up?

13:36.817 --> 13:38.149
Winston, I'm not sad. I'm mad!

13:38.151 --> 13:39.284
Bloody brilliant.

13:39.286 --> 13:40.752
Okay. Cool.

13:40.754 --> 13:42.187
Thanks for the call.

13:42.189 --> 13:44.322
I'm not letting you throw away
your dreams, okay?

13:44.324 --> 13:46.024
You're proposing in
that bus station bathroom,

13:46.026 --> 13:47.792
and I am going to help you.

13:47.794 --> 13:49.294
I'll meet you there in one hour,

13:49.296 --> 13:51.129
and I'm bringing
the bobcat suit.

13:51.131 --> 13:52.664
Bobcat suit?

13:52.666 --> 13:56.334
Thank God,
because my plan B was weak!

13:56.336 --> 13:57.535
(grunts)

14:02.609 --> 14:04.008
(sighs)

14:04.010 --> 14:05.877
(grunts)

14:05.879 --> 14:08.179
(whoops)

14:08.181 --> 14:11.349
(chuckles):
I'm the man.

14:11.351 --> 14:12.884
CECE: Okay, she's not looking.
Come on, let's go.

14:12.886 --> 14:14.185
We can go now, we can go.
No, don't move.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.720
If we move,
we-- I'm-I'm fired.

14:15.722 --> 14:17.121
NICK: She's not gonna
get off this roof.

14:17.123 --> 14:18.690
I know how to handle this.
Are you out of your mind?

14:18.692 --> 14:20.792
You're just gonna materialize
out of thin air on a rooftop?

14:20.794 --> 14:22.126
Easy. I work here.
I'm a window washer,

14:22.128 --> 14:23.695
and I finally got
to the top floor.

14:23.697 --> 14:24.896
You don't like that one?
How about this one?

14:24.898 --> 14:26.664
I'm a traffic guy, and I fell
out of the news chopper.

14:26.666 --> 14:28.800
What are you talking about?
All these work perfectly.

14:28.802 --> 14:30.235
I'll just pick my favorite
on the way over.

14:30.237 --> 14:31.669
Sit down, you nincompoop.

14:31.671 --> 14:33.371
This is completely
my fault.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.974
I just really wanted to do
something big for you,

14:35.976 --> 14:38.676
because you do so many
romantic things for me.

14:38.678 --> 14:40.311
And I just
wanted to find

14:40.313 --> 14:44.582
some way to show you
how much I love you.

14:44.584 --> 14:48.753
Instead, all I did
was mess up your job.

14:48.755 --> 14:50.388
(sighs)

14:50.390 --> 14:51.890
Cece.

14:51.892 --> 14:55.060
I'm sorry.

14:55.061 --> 14:58.229
You mean more to me
than any job ever will.

15:01.401 --> 15:02.934
Screw it.

15:02.936 --> 15:04.002
Screw what? What?

15:04.004 --> 15:05.370
(sighs)

15:05.372 --> 15:06.371
(sniffles)

15:06.373 --> 15:08.106
I love Cece!

15:09.609 --> 15:11.242
Oh, well, then
I love Schmidt!

15:12.679 --> 15:13.778
I love him.

15:13.780 --> 15:16.547
Love you.
Love you.

15:16.549 --> 15:17.949
Well, this is
a productive use of time.

15:17.951 --> 15:19.851
What the hell
is going on, Schmidt?

15:19.853 --> 15:22.687
And what is that guy doing?

15:22.689 --> 15:24.889
I'm a chimney sweep.
All these are clogged.

15:24.891 --> 15:25.790
A chim...?

15:25.792 --> 15:27.692
Clogged, clogged, clogged.

15:27.694 --> 15:29.694
Are you crying? That's the
question. Are you crying?

15:29.696 --> 15:31.763
I just met my birth mother.

15:31.765 --> 15:34.632
I don't have to explain myself
to a chimney sweep.

15:34.634 --> 15:37.368
Schmidt, why are you dressed
like a Little Rascal?

15:37.370 --> 15:39.871
The truth is it's...

15:39.873 --> 15:41.039
it's our bone-iversary.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.140
(groans)

15:42.142 --> 15:45.043
Kim, this job
means so much to me,

15:45.045 --> 15:47.378
but...

15:47.380 --> 15:48.746
she means a lot more.

15:48.748 --> 15:51.182
So...

15:51.183 --> 15:53.617
if this costs me the promotion,
then I can live with that.

15:53.620 --> 15:56.888
You know, this is the first
conversation we've ever had

15:56.890 --> 15:59.424
where you weren't lying to me.

15:59.426 --> 16:00.992
It's nice.

16:00.994 --> 16:03.094
I'm not flaming with rage.

16:03.096 --> 16:04.662
And by the way,

16:04.664 --> 16:06.764
I've noticed
you're working your ass off.

16:06.766 --> 16:09.067
Now get back to work.

16:09.069 --> 16:11.135
Cece, your décolletage
looks beautiful.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.204
Thank you.

16:15.742 --> 16:17.775
Okay. Yeah.

16:17.777 --> 16:19.310
It cleans up pretty nice.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.812
And this ring is perfect.

16:20.814 --> 16:22.747
How did you get Trevlo
to come down on the price?

16:22.749 --> 16:24.115
I don't think
it's a legitimate business,

16:24.117 --> 16:25.516
and that's the real answer.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.418
Anyway, I got it done.
(chuckles)

16:27.420 --> 16:29.754
Okay. I called the station,
they're sending Aly down

16:29.756 --> 16:31.823
on a public disturbance call.
Nice.

16:31.825 --> 16:33.758
I'm nervous, but, you know,

16:33.760 --> 16:35.693
I'm really glad we are
doing this, you know.

16:35.695 --> 16:37.495
If I didn't propose
in a public bathroom

16:37.497 --> 16:38.663
while wearing a bobcat costume,

16:38.665 --> 16:40.999
I would have regretted it
for the rest of my life.

16:41.001 --> 16:42.834
(indistinct
police radio chatter)
Oh, here she comes.

16:42.836 --> 16:44.302
Uh, put your head on.
Okay.

16:44.304 --> 16:45.903
Oh, nice touch.

16:47.007 --> 16:49.674
Police! You have five seconds
to pull your pants up.

16:50.710 --> 16:53.711
Your bus is leaving.

16:53.713 --> 16:55.847
Come on, man.
I'm having a really bad day.

16:55.849 --> 16:57.115
(roars)
(screams)

16:58.651 --> 17:00.051
(Winston groans)

17:00.053 --> 17:01.753
Ah, that's a concussion.

17:06.493 --> 17:08.893
Just a little bump, right?
What is going on?

17:10.630 --> 17:12.397
Happy Valentine's Day.

17:12.399 --> 17:13.865
What?

17:13.867 --> 17:15.867
Jess, why did you
decorate a bathroom?
Oh, boy.

17:15.869 --> 17:17.702
Why is Winston
dressed like a tiger?

17:17.704 --> 17:18.836
He's dressed as a bobcat, but...

17:18.838 --> 17:19.904
I got something I want to say.

17:22.075 --> 17:25.410
When my head hit the wall, it
knocked my eyes out of focus.

17:25.412 --> 17:26.744
So I'm gonna need you
to read it for me.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.579
Oh, my God. Okay.
I'm still a little woozy.

17:28.581 --> 17:29.747
JESS:
Um, Aly, um,

17:29.749 --> 17:31.682
look at Winston,

Aly,

19:07.981 --> 19:09.981
the only reason
I said no earlier

19:09.983 --> 19:13.684
is because I needed to show you

No. Not really.

20:55.221 --> 20:57.355
I don't know
if I'm a necklace guy.

20:57.357 --> 20:58.923
Well, some guys call it a chain.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.291
A chain?
Yeah.

21:00.293 --> 21:02.927
I call a chain the thing
you put on tires in the snow.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.695

I got to say,
