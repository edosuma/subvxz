WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:03.335
That should do it.

00:03.337 --> 00:05.571
I don't see why
this is necessary.

00:05.573 --> 00:06.638
You're about to enter

00:06.640 --> 00:08.607
a hornet's nest of insanity.

00:08.609 --> 00:10.609
I'm your bug repellant.

00:13.547 --> 00:15.280
You done? It's go time.

00:15.282 --> 00:17.349
Thank you for being my wingers.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.320
He means wingmen.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.225
(slow music playing)

00:28.462 --> 00:30.295
TOBY:
I'll be at a safe distance,

00:30.297 --> 00:33.365
analyzing the lovely gals
you're about to sit down with.

00:33.367 --> 00:34.800
Cabe, you be one position
in front of Walter

00:34.802 --> 00:35.801
so you can do recon.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.669
Recon? I wanted to try dating,

00:37.671 --> 00:39.571
not engage
in a military operation.

00:39.573 --> 00:40.806
For a humanoid like you,
it's gonna take

00:40.808 --> 00:42.641
precision coordination,
like D-Day.

00:42.643 --> 00:44.243
Why do you smell

00:44.245 --> 00:46.111
like a martini bar
in 1950?

00:46.113 --> 00:47.579
It's my cologne.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.381
I wear it every day.

00:49.382 --> 00:51.182
If you wore that every day,
I'd need my sinuses scraped.

00:51.185 --> 00:53.085
You're gonna dip your toe
into this dating pool,

00:53.087 --> 00:54.620
aren't you?

00:54.622 --> 00:56.255
(bell dinging)

00:57.191 --> 00:59.058
Speed daters,

00:59.060 --> 01:01.427
take your seats.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.529
You'll find your preassigned
numbers on the tables.

01:08.436 --> 01:10.369
Hey there.

01:10.371 --> 01:12.271
I think you're looking

01:12.273 --> 01:14.406
for our sunset circle

01:14.408 --> 01:16.075
with our other second-chancers.

01:16.811 --> 01:18.677
(sighs)

01:18.679 --> 01:20.579
Okay!

01:20.581 --> 01:24.083
Who is ready to connect?

01:24.085 --> 01:26.185
So you have eight balls
of the same size,

01:26.187 --> 01:27.086
seven weigh the same,

01:27.088 --> 01:28.620
one weighs slightly more.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.489
How do you find the one
that is heavier

01:30.491 --> 01:33.625
by using a balance
and only two weighings?

01:33.627 --> 01:35.294
What?

01:36.464 --> 01:39.631
What's your ideal number
of cats?

01:39.633 --> 01:41.233
Zero.

01:41.235 --> 01:43.235
Walter, you're displaying
intense disinterest.

01:43.237 --> 01:44.470
Try a compliment.

01:44.472 --> 01:47.439
Your features
are quite rodentiform.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.111
That's a lovely brooch.

01:52.113 --> 01:54.146
Thank you.

01:54.147 --> 01:56.180
I got it ten percent off
through AARP.

01:56.183 --> 01:58.417
Aren't their discounts
wonderful?

01:58.419 --> 02:00.302
How the hell would I know?

02:00.303 --> 02:02.186
(terrible British accent): And
then I told the prime minister,

02:02.189 --> 02:04.523
no bangers and mash
for you, eh, govnuh?

02:04.525 --> 02:06.692
Bugger off, ya old bloke.
(laughs)

02:06.694 --> 02:08.160
(normal voice):
See?

02:08.162 --> 02:09.394
I'm really good at accents.

02:09.396 --> 02:10.729
We're not a good match.

02:12.133 --> 02:13.298
Cheerio.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.633
I feel like Jane Goodall,

02:14.635 --> 02:16.835
but with less
socially-adjusted subjects.

02:16.837 --> 02:18.370
(sneezes)

02:18.372 --> 02:20.439
One Singapore sling.

02:29.683 --> 02:30.883
This should help him.

02:30.885 --> 02:33.752
Thanks, buddy.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.821
29 vitamins, amino acids

02:35.823 --> 02:38.157
and cod liver oil.

02:38.159 --> 02:41.426
(congested): This is what I get
for trying to help Walter date--

02:41.428 --> 02:42.761
influenza.

02:44.832 --> 02:47.533
Are you cool with this? Oh, yeah.
We had our flu shots.

02:47.535 --> 02:50.369
No. When O'Brien said
he was branching out socially,

02:50.371 --> 02:52.237
you kind of thought
it would be with you, right?

02:52.239 --> 02:54.306
I didn't think that at all.
We both made a decision

02:54.308 --> 02:56.408
not to see one another, and
if he wants to torture himself

02:56.410 --> 02:58.944
by speed-dating lunatics,
he can be my guest.

02:58.946 --> 03:01.246
As long as you're cool with it.

03:01.248 --> 03:03.448
WALTER:
Good morning...

03:03.450 --> 03:04.750
all.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.619
What's wrong with you?

03:06.620 --> 03:08.487
I caught the cooties watching
you and Groovy Grandpa

03:08.489 --> 03:10.322
fumble with
the ladies.

03:10.324 --> 03:13.525
Well, I feel that speed dating
was an unqualified success.

03:13.527 --> 03:16.061
It taught me that

03:16.062 --> 03:18.596
average speed daters
are not able to handle honesty.

03:18.599 --> 03:19.831
They all hated you.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.833
I will not be wasting my time
doing it again.

03:21.835 --> 03:25.470
I will pursue other avenues
to hone my social skills.

03:25.472 --> 03:28.840
In social situations,
there is a fine line

03:28.842 --> 03:31.877
between honesty and insult.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.879
Well, I-I don't see it.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.514
You're 100% wrong.

03:35.516 --> 03:37.749
Yes. Clearly you do not see it.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.918
(phone rings)

03:39.920 --> 03:41.420
Cabe?

03:41.422 --> 03:43.355
Yeah, I'm looking

03:43.357 --> 03:44.890
right at him.
Okay.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.225
See you soon.
(phone beeps off)

03:46.227 --> 03:47.826
Why did he ask if I was here?

03:47.828 --> 03:49.361
I did not ask.

03:49.363 --> 03:50.462
But why single me out?

03:50.464 --> 03:51.930
I mean,
there-there are five of us.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.232
WALTER:
You can ask him yourself

03:53.234 --> 03:55.267
in ten seconds.
He was parking the car.

03:55.269 --> 03:56.835
Oh. Okay.

03:59.373 --> 04:00.772
Is he mad or something?

04:00.774 --> 04:02.007
(door opens)

04:02.009 --> 04:03.642
Gather round.

04:03.644 --> 04:04.876
It's briefing time.

04:06.313 --> 04:08.480
Homeland considers this
a top priority,

04:08.482 --> 04:11.483
so I ask that you keep
an open mind.

04:11.485 --> 04:14.653
I will. My mind is so
open, in fact, a lot of...

04:14.655 --> 04:16.955
bad thoughts are
coming in. So, uh,

04:16.957 --> 04:20.025
could you tell me why you
singled me out in particular?

04:20.995 --> 04:23.762
It's in the folder, kid.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.336
You okay, buddy?

04:31.338 --> 04:32.904
(exhales)

04:34.008 --> 04:36.341
(panting)

04:36.343 --> 04:38.343
130.

04:38.345 --> 04:42.447
Your pulse is racing like
you just finished a marathon.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.683
I cannot do this mission.

04:44.685 --> 04:45.851
What's going on?
(door opens)

04:45.853 --> 04:47.853
Everyone,
say hello to Ken.

04:47.855 --> 04:50.389
Retired colonel,
Aachen Army Base.

04:50.391 --> 04:52.524
He is an expert

04:52.526 --> 04:55.360
in unconventional weapons
of mass destruction.

04:55.362 --> 04:58.797
He so happens to be
Sylvester's father.

05:02.036 --> 05:04.970
Hello, sir.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.438
Ken has given speeches

05:06.440 --> 05:08.040
to NATO, the
Joint Chiefs,

05:08.042 --> 05:09.875
and the UN
Security Council.

05:09.877 --> 05:12.577
He believes that a weapon
thought impossible to construct

05:12.579 --> 05:15.314
not only exists
but it's currently being tested

05:15.316 --> 05:16.815
by an unfriendly
nation.

05:16.817 --> 05:20.052
The Pentagon has asked for us
to work with him on this matter.

05:20.054 --> 05:21.553
Ken, the floor is yours.

05:21.555 --> 05:22.554
During the Second World War...

05:22.556 --> 05:24.456
Um, Colonel,
before we jump in,

05:24.458 --> 05:26.858
do, uh, you and Sylvester
want to take a few minutes

05:26.860 --> 05:28.994
to, uh, catch up?

05:28.996 --> 05:30.462
I know it's been
a while.

05:30.464 --> 05:32.497
Nine years, three
months, two days.

05:33.467 --> 05:35.600
We're fine.

05:35.602 --> 05:38.470
As I was saying, during
the Second World War,

05:38.472 --> 05:40.839
the Axis powers were looking for
an advantage over the Allies,

05:40.841 --> 05:42.474
no matter where
it came from.

05:42.476 --> 05:44.009
Even if it came
from the heavens.

05:44.011 --> 05:47.012
You're looking at the Sun Gun,
one of

05:47.014 --> 05:48.880
their more
ambitious projects.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.749
Based on archives recovered
during the war,

05:50.751 --> 05:53.618
we believe that their plan
was to build a space station

05:53.620 --> 05:55.854
8,200 kilometers
above the Earth.

05:55.856 --> 05:58.090
Reflectors made
of metallic sodium

05:58.092 --> 06:00.359
would be attached
to the satellite

06:00.361 --> 06:04.062
to create a concave mirror
the size of ten football fields.

06:04.064 --> 06:07.065
Something that big could reflect
concentrated sunlight

06:07.067 --> 06:09.501
on a precise point on the Earth.

06:09.503 --> 06:11.470
Like an entire city.

06:11.471 --> 06:13.438
Instantaneous combustion--
everything gone in a second.

06:13.440 --> 06:14.973
This is real
or-or theoretical?

06:14.975 --> 06:17.576
Theoretical-- he's been looking
for it since I was six.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.411
Until yesterday.

06:20.414 --> 06:22.681
This was captured on a dash cam.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.383
HAPPY:
That does look

06:24.385 --> 06:26.852
like a highly concentrated
beam of solar energy.

06:26.854 --> 06:29.521
Or a bolt of lightning
or a charged particle,

06:29.523 --> 06:30.922
like from
the Northern Lights.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.391
Where was this shot?

06:32.393 --> 06:33.925
The nation of Bahari,
a North African country

06:33.927 --> 06:36.928
run by President Desta Rahal.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.830
That video shows a solar beam

06:38.832 --> 06:40.966
very close to being
fully perfected and weaponized.

06:40.968 --> 06:43.802
That video<i> might </i>
show something.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.470
It's highly speculative.
Rahal came

06:45.472 --> 06:47.672
into power
via military coup.

06:47.674 --> 06:49.808
He craves
international acceptance.

06:49.810 --> 06:52.677
His people crave food
and freedom.

06:52.679 --> 06:55.580
How does President Cuckoo
put together a weapon like this?

06:55.582 --> 06:57.949
The Germans occupied Bahari
during the war.

06:57.951 --> 07:00.185
They left behind a lot
of buried bunkers.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.053
Rahal could have found

07:02.055 --> 07:04.456
some of the prototypes
70 years later.

07:04.458 --> 07:05.791
And if that's the case,

07:05.793 --> 07:08.827
we need to locate and destroy
the Sun Gun

07:08.829 --> 07:10.662
before Rahal has a chance
to perfect it.

07:10.664 --> 07:14.032
And the problem is is Bahari
is 200,000 square miles,

07:14.034 --> 07:17.035
and Homeland doesn't have the
tech to track down this weapon.

07:17.037 --> 07:18.904
That's where Scorpion
comes in.

07:18.906 --> 07:20.906
Okay. So you want us
to look for something

07:20.908 --> 07:23.909
that reflects heat in the middle
of the African desert?

07:23.911 --> 07:26.812
It's like looking for a
drop of water in the ocean.

07:26.814 --> 07:29.481
Except for the flare
on the video is brief

07:29.483 --> 07:32.651
and concentrated.
Likely a system test. So,

07:32.653 --> 07:35.120
equally likely that
the reflective panels

07:35.122 --> 07:37.088
would've been stored
away after the test.

07:37.090 --> 07:40.492
And the panels, having absorbed
the concentrated solar energy,

07:40.494 --> 07:43.195
primarily hydrogen and helium,

07:43.197 --> 07:45.096
would still carry
the residue of the elements

07:45.098 --> 07:46.898
on a molecular level.

07:46.899 --> 07:48.699
We can build a helium
mass spectrometer and merge it

07:48.702 --> 07:49.935
with a pyranometer.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.169
Someone want to clarify?

07:51.171 --> 07:53.004
Our device would
look for the residue

07:53.006 --> 07:55.507
of the concentrated
solar energy.

07:55.509 --> 07:58.009
It's like looking for ashes after a fire.
TOBY: Great.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.145
So how do we sneak
into a dictator's country

08:00.147 --> 08:02.214
and abscond his death ray?

08:02.216 --> 08:04.216
You're not going
anywhere, sicko.

08:04.218 --> 08:06.485
Uh, then I'll stay home, and
I-I will take care of Toby.

08:06.487 --> 08:08.587
WALTER:
No, you're coming to run

08:08.589 --> 08:10.789
the software
for the devices that we build.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.259
Homeland has advised Rahal

08:14.261 --> 08:16.862
that we are aware
of the strong energy readings

08:16.864 --> 08:18.563
coming from
the Bahari Desert.

08:18.565 --> 08:19.798
His regime is subject

08:19.800 --> 08:20.932
to spot inspections.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.133
He's been advised

08:22.135 --> 08:25.871
that a multidisciplinary team
of geniuses

08:25.873 --> 08:28.273
will be visiting to ensure
that those readings

08:28.275 --> 08:30.275
are not chemical or atomic.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.611
Plane leaves soon.
Better start packing.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.613
Okay. Walter?

08:34.615 --> 08:36.014
Yes.
I can't go.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.749
WALTER:
Being around a dictator

08:37.751 --> 08:41.186
isn't how I would like
to spend my weekend either.

08:41.188 --> 08:44.956
It's not the dictator
from Bahari I'm worried about.

08:44.958 --> 08:46.992
It's the one
from Rancho Cucamonga.

08:46.994 --> 08:49.261
Better hit the head
before we leave, Sylvester.

08:49.263 --> 08:51.596
Once we're on the road,
I'm not stopping for anything.

08:52.599 --> 08:54.666
Just like old times.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.814
(indistinct shouting)

09:16.023 --> 09:17.122
(pounding on vehicle)

09:17.124 --> 09:19.758
Oh, my God. This is awful.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.726
Move! Move!
Move!

09:27.334 --> 09:31.069
HAPPY:<i> Double-reinforced</i>
<i>steel gate, remote operational.</i>

09:31.071 --> 09:34.039
<i> This guy's security's no joke.</i>

09:37.277 --> 09:40.045
His people starve,
he lives like a king.

09:40.047 --> 09:44.049
Well, I'm not a fan either, but
let's keep that to ourselves.

09:44.051 --> 09:46.284
Rahal's known to
fly off the handle

09:46.286 --> 09:48.787
at the smallest
perceived slight.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.856
Welcome, Team Scorpion,

09:51.858 --> 09:54.159
to my humble country.
Mr. President.

09:54.161 --> 09:56.928
I'm Cabe Gallo,
U.S. Homeland Security.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.197
This is Retired
Colonel Kenneth Dodd.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.749
As per international agreement,

10:00.750 --> 10:02.300
you are free to survey
without restriction.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.136
But I assure you,

10:04.137 --> 10:05.971
all you will find
is a nation desperate to grow

10:05.973 --> 10:08.206
and become part
of the first world.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.375
(quietly): Feeding your people
might be a start.

10:10.377 --> 10:11.876
Mr. President,
the Western allies

10:11.878 --> 10:14.145
are just curious
about the energy flare

10:14.147 --> 10:15.981
that was captured
over your desert recently.

10:15.983 --> 10:18.116
A kilowatt overload

10:18.117 --> 10:20.250
caused an energy arc
in one of our solar turbines.

10:20.253 --> 10:23.321
It brought down that
building over there.

10:25.626 --> 10:27.626
HAPPY:
Could be legit.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.361
I told you before, there's
no such thing as a Sun Gun.

10:29.363 --> 10:31.730
My father is obsessed
with a fairy tale.

10:31.732 --> 10:32.998
And as a celebration

10:33.000 --> 10:34.366
of your visit, tonight

10:34.368 --> 10:37.102
I will host a reception
in your honor.

10:37.104 --> 10:39.804
For now, we'd just like
to drop our stuff in our room

10:39.806 --> 10:41.673
and get started.

10:41.675 --> 10:44.175
(chuckles)
Then let it be so.

10:44.177 --> 10:47.178
Come. Your rooms.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.215
What's the matter,
you hot or something?

10:50.217 --> 10:53.284
What, I'm not allowed
to be hot in Africa?

10:54.254 --> 10:56.121
Okay, room's clean.

10:56.123 --> 10:58.089
No one eavesdropping.

10:58.091 --> 10:59.991
All right,
let's get to work.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.259
Toby, you got
eyes on us?

11:01.261 --> 11:02.827
I have sat photos
of the compound

11:02.829 --> 11:04.896
refreshing every 20 seconds

11:04.898 --> 11:06.364
and I have control
of the cameras.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.800
All right, let us know
when his goons get close.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.702
I want to have a look
inside that burned facility.

11:10.704 --> 11:13.805
The Sun Gun would be
a volatile piece of equipment.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.707
So that solar panel story
of his might just be a cover

11:15.709 --> 11:16.941
for what really set that blaze.

11:16.943 --> 11:18.109
And if there's enough, uh,

11:18.111 --> 11:19.911
metallic sodium reflectors

11:19.913 --> 11:22.414
for a weapons-grade mirror,
it won't fit into a tool shed.

11:22.416 --> 11:24.949
We need to check
the biggest buildings first.

11:24.951 --> 11:26.951
Now, Cabe, Happy and I will
check out the burned building

11:26.953 --> 11:30.021
while Sly, Paige and Ken
will investigate the hangar

11:30.023 --> 11:31.690
that we passed on the way in.

11:31.692 --> 11:34.926
There's a guard station
50 yards from the hangar.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.094
Step light in there.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.262
Actually, Walt,
I'll go with you

11:37.264 --> 11:38.963
and then Happy
can go with my dad.

11:38.965 --> 11:40.965
No, we need
someone

11:40.967 --> 11:42.834
with software expertise
on each team.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.302
Yeah?

11:44.304 --> 11:45.370
(knocking)

11:47.474 --> 11:48.907
Good afternoon.

11:50.977 --> 11:54.112
President Rahal requests
the company of Walter O'Brien.

11:54.114 --> 11:57.215
Actually, we're about
to get to work.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.383
Perhaps they could
talk at the dinner?

11:58.385 --> 12:00.452
President Rahal anticipated

12:00.454 --> 12:02.187
this response and he stated that

12:02.189 --> 12:03.755
he wouldn't
request this

12:03.757 --> 12:04.923
unless it were quite urgent.

12:04.925 --> 12:07.058
He said he was certain
you'd understand.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.497
Happy, I'm assuming that you can

12:12.499 --> 12:14.466
handle the Geiger counters?

12:17.437 --> 12:18.970
Okay.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.405
I'll catch you later.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.273
Yeah.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.008
Walter,

12:24.010 --> 12:25.877
be a beta dog with Rahal.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.212
Remember, he's the kind of guy

12:27.214 --> 12:29.848
who gets stabby when offended.
(sniffles)

12:35.288 --> 12:37.088
Is this beef barley?

12:37.090 --> 12:39.057
How'd you know my favorite soup?

12:39.059 --> 12:41.426
Eat it.
You look awful.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.931
Mr., uh,
Mr. President?

12:46.933 --> 12:49.901
Ah, Walter, Walter.

12:49.903 --> 12:51.202
Please, come in.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.238
I'm sorry to take you
away from your work,

12:53.240 --> 12:56.407
but, uh, I thought it
important we speak.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.943
We are similar men.

12:58.945 --> 13:01.446
Both leaders,
both geniuses.

13:01.448 --> 13:05.316
Although your IQ
may only be 197 to my 203.

13:05.318 --> 13:07.318
203? Really?

13:07.320 --> 13:10.121
Let it go, Walt. On this date,
honesty could get you killed.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.792
That is...
that's a very impressive score.

13:13.794 --> 13:16.928
As a fellow genius,
I respect you.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.530
And I know why you are here.

13:18.532 --> 13:20.265
You're after something.

13:21.268 --> 13:22.867
A challenge.

13:22.869 --> 13:24.335
Eh? I know
all about your work,

13:24.337 --> 13:26.938
from saving that boy
on the beach

13:26.940 --> 13:28.940
to designing
that smart building.

13:28.942 --> 13:32.410
That is why I want to offer you
a job as my chief of technology.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.212
Seven figures a year
to start.

13:34.214 --> 13:37.048
But first,
a sign of friendship.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.917
Come.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.552
What...

13:40.554 --> 13:44.455
A delicacy
from your native Ireland.

13:44.457 --> 13:47.091
Boiled potatoes and whiskey.

13:49.062 --> 13:51.830
HAPPY: Okay, I'm
getting nothing here--

13:51.832 --> 13:53.364
no helium residue.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.934
Maybe Sly's right-- maybe
the Sun Gun's just a legend.

13:55.936 --> 13:57.836
Possibly.

13:57.838 --> 14:00.071
But this doesn't mean
concentrated solar energy

14:00.073 --> 14:02.240
didn't take this building apart.

14:02.242 --> 14:04.909
Just that the metallic
sodium panels aren't here.

14:04.911 --> 14:07.212
If you were gonna blast
a building with a solar weapon,

14:07.214 --> 14:09.447
how would you fire at it?
From what kind of angle?

14:09.449 --> 14:11.115
Where are you going with this?

14:11.117 --> 14:14.319
A hundred yards up there...
there's an aerostat.

14:14.321 --> 14:17.856
Now, why would a country without
and air force need a blimp

14:17.858 --> 14:20.091
used for radar detection?

14:20.093 --> 14:22.527
To get a solar weapon
high enough up in the air

14:22.529 --> 14:24.062
to do a test run.

14:24.064 --> 14:26.197
You float the prototype Sun Gun
up in the air,

14:26.199 --> 14:27.498
you test it,

14:27.500 --> 14:29.868
you accidentally destroy
one of your own buildings.

14:29.870 --> 14:31.135
Only question is...

14:31.137 --> 14:32.270
Where the hell's
the Sun Gun?

14:32.272 --> 14:34.105
Took the words
out of my mouth.

14:34.106 --> 14:35.939
I am no expert, but I live
in L.A. and I do know what

14:35.942 --> 14:37.375
a ton of solar panels
look like, and maybe

14:37.377 --> 14:39.344
El Presidente
was telling the truth.

14:39.346 --> 14:40.445
Turn that thing on.

14:40.447 --> 14:42.146
It is on.
There's no readings

14:42.148 --> 14:44.415
because there's no helium
because there's no Sun Gun.

14:44.417 --> 14:45.934
There's 40 yards of supposed

14:45.935 --> 14:47.452
solar panels in here--
we're gonna check

14:47.454 --> 14:49.454
every one of 'em
with that gizmo.

14:49.456 --> 14:50.989
This is a waste of time.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.657
It has always been
a waste of time.

14:52.659 --> 14:55.326
You don't understand. No, I don't
understand why your first priority

14:55.328 --> 14:57.195
was always chasing
these archaic weapons

14:57.197 --> 14:59.097
that are as real as unicorns.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.431
Um, fellas, fellas,
maybe we should

15:00.433 --> 15:02.166
just save this argument
for another time.

15:02.168 --> 15:04.185
TOBY:
I'm with Paige.

15:04.186 --> 15:06.203
There's guards sniffing around
not too far from the hangar,

15:06.206 --> 15:07.505
and if you think you're gonna
search that whole place

15:07.507 --> 15:09.207
before they get to you,
you're mistaken.

15:09.209 --> 15:12.377
Fine. I can put this whole thing
to bed in a matter of seconds.

15:15.582 --> 15:18.249
Great, what's that--
another toy for Mr. Fun Man?

15:18.251 --> 15:19.918
Super Fun Guy.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.653
And no, it's a way
to prove you wrong.

15:21.655 --> 15:23.087
Give me your lighter.

15:24.591 --> 15:28.293
If there are metallic
sodium reflectors

15:28.295 --> 15:31.462
in this room, then any source
of natural light

15:31.464 --> 15:34.365
would be bounced back
1,000 times its concentration,

15:34.367 --> 15:36.401
so be very careful.

15:36.403 --> 15:37.936
All right.

15:40.540 --> 15:44.108
Now aim at a different
row of solar panels.

15:46.046 --> 15:48.546
Now throw.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.089
I told you!
I knew it was real, I knew it!

15:58.091 --> 15:59.324
No way.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.059
Stay here and look out
for the guards. Come on.

16:12.973 --> 16:15.640
Oh!

16:15.642 --> 16:18.509
Sylvester, look at this.
This panel is just

16:18.511 --> 16:20.211
a colored glass facade
to cover up

16:20.213 --> 16:22.113
the metallic
sodium panel underneath.

16:22.115 --> 16:25.383
He hid weaponized panels
right in plain sight.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.585
TOBY: Oh, it's genius.
He knows his country's

16:27.587 --> 16:29.253
crawling with inspectors.

16:29.255 --> 16:30.555
If Sun Gun components are found
he's dead,

16:30.557 --> 16:32.991
so he puts them
right under everyone's noses.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.392
These are old welding marks

16:34.394 --> 16:36.627
around the corners
of these panels.

16:36.629 --> 16:38.296
Rahal must've found

16:38.298 --> 16:41.532
these three prototypes
in an old German bunker

16:41.534 --> 16:44.535
and now he's trying them out
for the purpose of duplication.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.270
Then break these things
and let's get out of here.

16:46.272 --> 16:48.439
Not an option. Toby says
the guards are right outside.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.641
This alloy is strong as hell.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.410
Breaking these things
will make noise.

16:52.412 --> 16:53.678
Noise gets us caught.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.713
Leave the solar panels,
once you're stateside,

16:55.715 --> 16:57.281
have the air force
make a special delivery.

16:57.283 --> 16:59.317
No, no, no, we can't do that.
If we do that,

16:59.319 --> 17:01.285
we'll just be destroying
the very evidence that we need

17:01.287 --> 17:03.454
to unseat and prosecute Rahal.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.023
Plus the evidence
to show everybody back home

17:05.025 --> 17:06.157
that you were right?

17:06.159 --> 17:09.360
That does not
play into my decision.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.462
We can't just smuggle
these panels out of the country.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.031
Why not?
'Cause Rahal's men--

17:13.033 --> 17:14.499
they're going to check our bags

17:14.501 --> 17:15.767
and then he'll have us killed.

17:15.769 --> 17:17.335
Nah.
May have a way

17:17.337 --> 17:19.303
around the whole
"getting killed" thing.

17:19.305 --> 17:21.406
I know what everybody
thinks of me.

17:22.509 --> 17:23.708
I'm a madman,

17:23.710 --> 17:26.444
warlord, murderer.

17:26.446 --> 17:30.114
Well, you know, "everyone" would
be statistically improbable.

17:30.116 --> 17:31.315
Ah, you see.

17:31.317 --> 17:32.717
Now, you get me.

17:32.719 --> 17:35.053
But I am merely trying
to save my people.

17:35.055 --> 17:36.587
That is why
I need your help.

17:36.589 --> 17:39.590
I need you to build me a rocket.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.225
You've done it
before, huh?

17:41.227 --> 17:44.629
Chew on that
while I get some cigars.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.300
So you're looking at air
currents moving southwest

17:49.302 --> 17:51.002
at 90 kilometers per hour.

17:51.003 --> 17:52.703
Got it. Happy, what are
the approximate dimensions

17:52.705 --> 17:56.240
of the aerostat?
Uh, length 100, diameter 20.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.176
I still don't understand
how this works.

17:58.178 --> 17:59.510
Okay, the aerostat's
200 yards away.

17:59.512 --> 18:00.778
We put the Sun Gun panels in it,

18:00.780 --> 18:03.381
send it off,
and Rahal is now decades

18:03.383 --> 18:05.683
behind schedule
if he wants to make new ones.

18:05.685 --> 18:08.186
Remember, he didn't
build these, he found them.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.754
The Sun Gun could land anywhere.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.189
Which is why I am
running the numbers to predict

18:11.191 --> 18:13.191
the exact time and location
so the aerostat

18:13.193 --> 18:15.226
crashes in the Mediterranean.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.762
Where the Navy SEALs will
pick it up in a watertight bag.

18:17.764 --> 18:20.498
Now, if your calculations
are off, you could be delivering

18:20.500 --> 18:23.134
a WMD to a neighboring regime
that is not

18:23.136 --> 18:24.469
on Washington's
Christmas list.

18:24.471 --> 18:25.736
Trust me, I've got this.

18:25.738 --> 18:27.271
Just in case you don't,

18:27.273 --> 18:29.107
I want a photo record
of this technology,

18:29.109 --> 18:30.875
because if we lose it forever,

18:30.877 --> 18:33.311
I want proof of what Rahal
was trying to build.

18:33.313 --> 18:35.813
I got a more
practical concern--

18:35.815 --> 18:37.181
how are we gonna
get to the aerostat

18:37.183 --> 18:39.517
without Rahal's men noticing?

18:39.519 --> 18:41.452
<i> Hey, Walt,</i>

18:41.454 --> 18:42.820
you need to get the guards
to move away

18:42.822 --> 18:44.655
from the northeast corner
of the compound.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.824
What are you thinking?

18:46.826 --> 18:49.794
Huh? That a space program
tells the world,

18:49.796 --> 18:51.295
"Look at Bahari.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.297
Look what it can achieve."

18:53.299 --> 18:54.465
So what do you say?

18:54.467 --> 18:56.501
I say...
I say s-someone

18:56.503 --> 18:57.668
just jumped your southwest

18:57.670 --> 18:59.804
security wall.
No one is there.

18:59.806 --> 19:03.307
I will get my security
to check the video...

19:03.309 --> 19:05.510
Ah!
I'm messing with

19:05.512 --> 19:07.445
your system, emperor nutbar.

19:07.447 --> 19:08.679
I will be back shortly.

19:08.681 --> 19:09.881
My apologies.
Sure.

19:12.852 --> 19:15.153
Should give you ten minutes.

19:18.191 --> 19:20.158
Happy, what's this?
A small blimp.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.292
You said it was
100 by 20.

19:21.294 --> 19:22.460
Yeah, it's 100 feet
by 20 feet.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.312
I thought you meant meters.

19:24.313 --> 19:26.163
This country runs on the metric
system. Why didn't you convert?

19:26.166 --> 19:27.298
I'm American.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.534
Oh, boy.
Well, my calculations are off.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.435
The drop point is gonna be off
by several miles.

19:31.437 --> 19:33.437
CABE: If you're off that
much over the Mediterranean,

19:33.439 --> 19:35.173
the SEALs are never
gonna find this thing.

19:35.175 --> 19:37.175
Another problem-- look.

19:38.444 --> 19:40.711
Oh, Walter's distraction
is timing out.

19:40.713 --> 19:43.614
(exclaims)

19:43.616 --> 19:45.716
Toby, check Doppler radar
and tell me

19:45.718 --> 19:48.953
when the prevailing winds
are hitting exactly northeast,

19:48.955 --> 19:51.322
12.7 degrees.
I'm not gonna remind you

19:51.324 --> 19:52.523
that if the guards
see you with that thing,

19:52.525 --> 19:54.725
they'll shoot you on sight.
Toby!

19:54.727 --> 19:57.361
Northeast winds,
but only five degrees.

19:57.363 --> 20:00.198
Uh, truck's coming close.

20:00.200 --> 20:01.599
Northeast, ten degrees.

20:01.601 --> 20:04.202
Hold it!
Let it go, Sylvester!

20:04.204 --> 20:06.604
Two degrees could mean
200 miles.

20:06.606 --> 20:08.472
12 degrees. Listen to me,
OCD perfectionist,

20:08.474 --> 20:09.907
let the damn thing go.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.609
Truck's coming around the bend.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.578
Hold it!
TOBY: 1.7 degrees.

20:13.580 --> 20:14.745
Now!

20:17.517 --> 20:18.783
(grunts)

20:28.628 --> 20:29.961
It'll get to where
it needs to go.

20:29.963 --> 20:31.362
We figured it out.

20:31.364 --> 20:33.314
Yeah.

20:33.315 --> 20:35.265
If your calculations were
right the first time,

20:35.268 --> 20:38.369
we wouldn't have almost
gotten ourselves killed.

20:38.371 --> 20:40.004
We weren't able
to apprehend the man

20:40.006 --> 20:42.773
you saw earlier,
but we have doubled security.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.542
Well, I'm happy to have helped.

20:44.544 --> 20:46.410
You know,
I'm a benevolent leader,

20:46.412 --> 20:49.680
but there are still those
resistant to prosperity.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.949
Forcing me to take precautions.

20:51.951 --> 20:54.952
Armed guards,
bullet-proof windows.

20:54.954 --> 20:56.787
And you already saw the gate
you had to come through,

20:56.789 --> 20:59.490
which I have to recode
twice a day.

21:01.294 --> 21:03.527
Using the, uh, smart watch?
(beeps)

21:03.529 --> 21:05.463
Only my guards and I
know the code.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.331
You know, it's, uh...

21:08.301 --> 21:11.269
...it's hard to know
who to trust.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.772
But I trust you.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.875
That is why I want you
to head up our space program.

21:17.877 --> 21:20.011
Come. Come, Walter.

21:20.013 --> 21:23.614
Look at the plans
for my rocket.

21:34.661 --> 21:36.794
That was Homeland. The Navy
SEALs are just a few hours out

21:36.796 --> 21:38.663
from meeting up
with the aerostat.

21:38.665 --> 21:40.331
We're almost in the clear.

21:40.333 --> 21:41.499
Thank God.

21:41.501 --> 21:44.302
I'm about ready
for this day to be over.

21:46.606 --> 21:48.406
Stop packing.

21:48.408 --> 21:50.658
We can't leave.

21:50.659 --> 21:52.909
Why not? The panels are on
a one-way trip to SEAL Team Six.

21:52.912 --> 21:55.012
Right, but those are only
the panels that we've found.

21:55.014 --> 21:56.781
There is a good chance
that he has a way

21:56.783 --> 21:58.449
to mass-produce metallic
sodium panels.

21:58.451 --> 21:59.850
He may already have the ability

21:59.852 --> 22:01.686
to make a fully-functional
Sun Gun.

22:01.688 --> 22:03.505
Explain your thinking.

22:03.506 --> 22:05.323
He showed me the blueprints
for a rocket that he wants built

22:05.325 --> 22:06.724
with a load-bearing capacity
of at least six tons.

22:06.726 --> 22:08.359
That's about right
for a satellite

22:08.361 --> 22:09.827
bearing a full-sized
Sun Gun mirror.

22:09.829 --> 22:12.330
Well, just 'cause he wants
a rocket to send a weapon

22:12.332 --> 22:14.799
into space doesn't necessarily
mean he has a weapon.

22:14.801 --> 22:16.734
TOBY: Yeah, I'm sorry, Paige,
but it's human nature.

22:16.736 --> 22:19.737
You don't build a turnip truck
unless you already have turnips.

22:19.739 --> 22:23.474
So he's got a weapon that could
burn entire cities off the map.

22:23.476 --> 22:25.976
We can't leave until we find
his store of panels

22:25.978 --> 22:27.111
and take them out.

22:27.113 --> 22:28.846
(sighs)

22:28.848 --> 22:30.848
The adventure continues.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.616
Wonderful.

22:40.493 --> 22:42.927
So how do we find
this doomsday weapon factory?

22:42.929 --> 22:45.663
Nothing on the satellite
suggests a manufacturing plant,

22:45.665 --> 22:47.932
and there's no plans for one
in his entire system.

22:47.934 --> 22:49.967
Oh, well, it is here
and I know it.

22:49.969 --> 22:51.068
Can't we use
those things?

22:51.070 --> 22:52.536
HAPPY:
Uh, no.

22:52.538 --> 22:53.804
They only work on panels
that have

22:53.806 --> 22:54.939
already been exposed
to solar energy.

22:54.941 --> 22:56.574
Rahal's stockpile

22:56.576 --> 22:57.942
hasn't been used yet.

22:57.944 --> 22:59.410
He'd, uh, keep it safe

22:59.412 --> 23:01.112
until he's ready
to blast it into space

23:01.114 --> 23:03.080
with the rocket
he wants Walt to build.

23:03.082 --> 23:05.082
What you just said makes sense.

23:05.084 --> 23:06.584
Everything I say makes sense.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.586
No, about Rahal keeping
his stockpile safe.

23:08.588 --> 23:10.488
He can't risk such
a large quantity

23:10.490 --> 23:12.523
of panels being exposed
to sunlight.

23:12.525 --> 23:14.158
A reaction like that
would do more than

23:14.160 --> 23:16.060
just blow up a building.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.961
It would blow up the entire
compound and then some.

23:17.964 --> 23:20.131
He'd keep it underground,
away from the sunlight.

23:20.133 --> 23:21.699
There's dozens of buildings
on this compound.

23:21.701 --> 23:23.567
That factory could be
underneath any one of them.

23:23.569 --> 23:25.469
It would be impossible
to search all those buildings

23:25.471 --> 23:26.837
without Rahal noticing us.

23:26.839 --> 23:28.973
Well, then it's
up to you, Walter.

23:28.975 --> 23:30.391
How?

23:30.392 --> 23:31.808
Rahal's smitten
by your intellect,

23:31.811 --> 23:33.944
so I suggest you dangle your
great big brain in front of him

23:33.946 --> 23:35.479
and get some info.

23:36.449 --> 23:38.115
The man is
a megalomanical dictator.

23:38.117 --> 23:39.817
No excuses, Walt.

23:39.818 --> 23:41.518
Go see your new buddy
and shake your moneymaker.

23:43.456 --> 23:44.855
Oh, I'm...

23:44.857 --> 23:47.558
I'm glad you want to discuss
my offer of employment.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.560
Well, it sounds
intriguing.

23:49.562 --> 23:53.497
Perhaps we can, uh, look at the
blueprints again in your office?

23:53.499 --> 23:54.665
(laughs)

23:54.667 --> 23:56.667
Nonsense.

23:56.669 --> 23:58.736
I do my best thinking
in here. Come.

24:00.206 --> 24:01.539
TOBY:
Remember, Walt,

24:01.541 --> 24:02.740
you want something
from this guy,

24:02.742 --> 24:04.008
but you can't let him know.

24:04.010 --> 24:05.609
This isn't like speed-dating.

24:05.611 --> 24:06.877
You have to play it cool.

24:06.879 --> 24:08.779
So that rocket

24:08.781 --> 24:12.683
of yours looks like it could
carry a pretty heavy payload.

24:14.654 --> 24:17.154
Walter, what are you doing?
Slow your roll.

24:18.124 --> 24:19.990
(sighs):
Well...

24:19.992 --> 24:21.959
the plans are still
very rudimentary,

24:21.961 --> 24:24.161
(pats leg) but I'm
sure you will make it

24:24.163 --> 24:25.763
out of this world.

24:25.765 --> 24:26.897
(chuckles)
(brief chuckle)

24:26.899 --> 24:28.632
Get it, Walter?
"Out of this world."

24:28.634 --> 24:29.767
(laughs)

24:29.769 --> 24:31.902
Sit back, relax.

24:31.904 --> 24:34.538
You planning on taking
some research satellites?

24:34.540 --> 24:35.873
TOBY:
You're trying to eat dessert

24:35.875 --> 24:37.141
when they just served salad.

24:37.143 --> 24:38.976
Don't you know
how to romance someone?

24:38.978 --> 24:40.978
No, he does not.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.047
TOBY:
You got to butter this guy up,

24:43.049 --> 24:44.849
play to his ego--
then he'll open up.

24:47.520 --> 24:49.687
This is my
favorite cartoon.

24:49.689 --> 24:51.305
You are the best sitter

24:51.306 --> 24:52.922
since Mrs. Clatterman
gave me pudding for dinner.

24:52.925 --> 24:55.759
He's the coyote
with a business card.

24:55.761 --> 24:57.194
(laughing)

24:57.196 --> 24:58.929
He thinks he's a genius.

24:58.931 --> 25:01.899
I'm flattered by...

25:01.901 --> 25:05.803
the offer to work for a...
an intellect such as yours.

25:05.805 --> 25:08.239
Okay. I accept your offer.

25:08.241 --> 25:09.707
Let's do it.

25:09.709 --> 25:11.542
Fantastic!

25:11.544 --> 25:13.844
(pats leg) You will have the
finest equipment from Germany.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.946
During the day you will
build, and at night,

25:15.948 --> 25:17.214
cool off in our
Olympic-size pool.

25:17.216 --> 25:18.849
Walter...

25:18.851 --> 25:23.220
...this is going to be the
beginning of a winning partnership.

25:23.222 --> 25:24.522
Yeah.

25:24.523 --> 25:25.823
(laughs):
Walter!

25:25.825 --> 25:27.758
Ha-ha-ha! (grunts): Okay.

25:28.794 --> 25:30.594
(quietly):
I cannot believe

25:30.596 --> 25:32.229
that flattery and dishonesty

25:32.231 --> 25:34.231
actually worked.
How? We've got nothing.

25:34.233 --> 25:36.100
Did you hear him?

25:36.101 --> 25:37.968
An Olympic-size pool
in the middle of the desert

25:37.970 --> 25:40.170
where the average temperatures
are over 120 degrees.

25:40.172 --> 25:42.873
Which causes
severe evaporation.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.208
Okay, they'd need

25:44.210 --> 25:45.626
an auto-refill system,

25:45.627 --> 25:47.043
which demands major
plumbing infrastructure.

25:47.046 --> 25:49.246
Which is exactly what you'd need
if you're cooling

25:49.248 --> 25:50.981
newly manufactured
metallic sodium panels.

25:50.983 --> 25:52.950
There's a pretty big pump room
near the pool.

25:52.952 --> 25:55.719
Safe bet they're making
Sun Gun panels underneath it.

25:55.721 --> 25:58.122
Great, but how do we knock it out of
commission without them detecting us?

25:58.124 --> 25:59.657
We walk like Egyptians.

26:00.860 --> 26:03.260
Okay, ancient Egyptians
used to make mortar

26:03.262 --> 26:05.296
from water,
sand and limestone.

26:05.298 --> 26:07.865
The sand will be on the other
side of the basement walls,

26:07.867 --> 26:10.200
and we already know the pump
room will have water pipes.

26:10.202 --> 26:12.102
We'll fill it up and
turn the whole room

26:12.104 --> 26:13.804
into a big block
of stone.

26:13.806 --> 26:14.805
Where do we get the lime?

26:14.807 --> 26:16.273
Rahal's office.

26:16.275 --> 26:18.042
He has a large aquarium--

26:18.044 --> 26:21.879
that needs lime
to regulate its pH levels.

26:21.881 --> 26:23.981
Happy, Paige and I will get that
while Sly, Cabe

26:23.983 --> 26:25.950
and Ken get things ready
down in the pump room.

26:25.952 --> 26:27.151
What about
the guards?

26:27.153 --> 26:28.752
There's no guard.

26:28.754 --> 26:30.721
That makes sense-- if you
don't want people to think

26:30.723 --> 26:32.723
you have something valuable,
don't post thugs outside.

26:32.725 --> 26:34.725
Doesn't mean there won't
be a security system.

26:34.727 --> 26:36.327
Then we better hurry,
because that dinner party starts

26:36.329 --> 26:38.228
in less than an hour--
if we're not there,

26:38.230 --> 26:39.964
those men are gonna
come looking for us.

Not good.

Problem solvers start
sentences off with "How about."

Yeah, and "What if."

I got it.

27:40.026 --> 27:41.892
If they are manufacturing

27:41.894 --> 27:43.761
metallic sodium plates
under here,

27:43.763 --> 27:45.396
then they need
to vent chlorine gas.

27:45.398 --> 27:47.164
It's a byproduct of production.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.767
So one of these
supposed pool pump tanks

27:49.769 --> 27:53.303
must have a release valve
for the gas.

27:53.305 --> 27:55.873
This is it.
Uh, when chlorine gas

27:55.875 --> 27:57.408
meets oxygen,
you get corrosion.

27:57.410 --> 27:59.410
You're gonna need a hose.

27:59.412 --> 28:01.845
You actually understand
what these guys are thinking?

28:01.847 --> 28:05.215
About half--
and the rest I take on faith.

28:07.253 --> 28:09.286
Hey, guys, I've seen
what chlorine gas can do

28:09.288 --> 28:11.822
on the battlefield--
it's not pr... (grunts)

28:12.925 --> 28:14.692
Cabe.

28:15.928 --> 28:18.429
My water fan, please?

28:19.899 --> 28:21.198
What are you doing?

28:21.200 --> 28:23.367
When water
and chlorine gas mix,

28:23.369 --> 28:25.369
it makes hydrochloric acid,

28:25.371 --> 28:27.438
which will eat through the lock.

28:28.474 --> 28:30.407
This should do it.

28:33.112 --> 28:34.478
What is wrong with you people!

28:36.115 --> 28:38.048
Uh, what the hell is this?

28:38.050 --> 28:39.850
Who has been near my fish?

28:41.253 --> 28:43.787
And who is responsible
for this wine mishap?

28:43.789 --> 28:45.022
I assure you, sir,

28:45.024 --> 28:47.357
I'll rectify it.
Make sure you do.

28:48.761 --> 28:50.961
I'm trying to impress
these stupid Americans.

28:50.963 --> 28:52.830
I will hold you
personally responsible

28:52.832 --> 28:54.331
if things are not perfect.

28:54.333 --> 28:55.966
Yes, sir.

28:57.236 --> 28:58.902
RAHAL:
Idiots!

28:58.904 --> 29:00.304
(door closes)

29:00.306 --> 29:02.973
Here comes the sand
for your mortar.

29:02.975 --> 29:04.441
(grunting)

29:04.443 --> 29:07.411
There's got to be hundreds
of panels in here.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.980
SYLVESTER: 236, to be precise.
KEN: There's enough panels in here

29:09.982 --> 29:12.149
to make a Sun Gun
twice the size we thought.

29:12.151 --> 29:14.184
Well, they didn't make these--
this is

29:14.186 --> 29:16.019
the city seal of Hamburg.

29:16.021 --> 29:18.489
We are standing
in an abandoned German lab.

29:18.491 --> 29:20.791
So Rahal not only found
those few panels

29:20.793 --> 29:24.027
we discovered in the hangar, but
he found all this old equipment,

29:24.029 --> 29:26.396
got it running again. Yeah,
well, we're gonna shut it down.

29:26.398 --> 29:28.465
We're gonna drown
this place up in mortar,

29:28.467 --> 29:30.534
make these machines
nonoperational.

29:30.536 --> 29:32.653
Yeah, that'll kill
his weapons program.

29:32.654 --> 29:34.771
This machinery has zero
update; they have no plans.

Heads up! Lime incoming!

Hey, Walt and Paige

party to swipe Rahal's watch

29:46.385 --> 29:49.386
so we can get
through the front gate.

29:49.388 --> 29:51.054
Okay. You get over there
with them, too,

29:51.056 --> 29:52.990

that we're on our way.

29:52.992 --> 29:55.092
The more of you that are over
there, the less suspicious

29:55.094 --> 29:56.960
he's gonna be. Roger that.
You guys hurry up.

29:56.962 --> 29:58.028
I'm gonna
hotwire us

29:58.030 --> 29:59.830

29:59.832 --> 30:01.498
You guys go ahead
and start mixing the mortar up.

30:01.500 --> 30:03.133
You should do it
in about 20 minutes.

30:03.135 --> 30:04.501
You guys better be
outside in 21--

30:04.503 --> 30:06.503
we won't have
a second to spare.

30:07.273 --> 30:10.808
Okay, you pour the lime;

30:10.810 --> 30:12.543
I'll start stirring.
All right.

did with the gas up there--

30:17.116 --> 30:18.515
very impressive.

30:18.517 --> 30:20.083
How do you know all that?

30:20.085 --> 30:22.519

30:28.877 --> 30:30.260
You got to put your back

Barely.

30:40.873 --> 30:42.339
What the heck happened?

30:43.542 --> 30:46.176
Why do you still have
the original panels?

30:46.178 --> 30:48.245
They should be over
the Mediterranean by now.

30:48.247 --> 30:51.415
I couldn't risk them
ending up in enemy hands.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.016
They wouldn't have wound up
in enemy hands.

30:53.018 --> 30:54.729
I did the calculations
perfectly.

30:54.730 --> 30:56.441
You just didn't trust me?

30:56.442 --> 30:58.153
You confused feet with meters.
I had no choice!

No. You asked Happy to take

SYLVESTER: Well, you're gonna
get a chance to know me now,

31:28.621 --> 31:32.189

welded the hatch shut!

31:32.191 --> 31:33.657

How?

37:58.944 --> 38:00.477
It's sealed shut.

38:00.479 --> 38:02.612
We can undo the seal
the same way we warped it.

38:02.614 --> 38:03.747
By hitting its hinges

38:03.749 --> 38:05.515
with a concentrated
beam of light!

38:05.517 --> 38:07.417
Can you reach the panel
that fell from before?

38:07.419 --> 38:09.686
(grunting)

38:09.688 --> 38:11.788
But we don't have enough light
in here to make it work.

38:11.790 --> 38:15.692
Then we will make our own,
huh? Okay.

38:15.694 --> 38:18.295
Now, we need to aim
and time this perfectly, or else

38:18.297 --> 38:21.398
the beam could bounce back at us
and make us extra crispy.

38:21.400 --> 38:23.566
You need to throw that
five point seven feet

38:23.568 --> 38:26.454
in the air at a 60-degree
angle with backspin.

38:26.480 --> 38:27.437
Like a Frisbee?

38:27.439 --> 38:29.906
Sort of. I'm not a sports guy,
but you need to catch it.

38:29.908 --> 38:31.708
We can't let it break.

38:31.709 --> 38:33.244
We need it to free our
legs from the mortar.

38:33.270 --> 38:33.909

38:33.912 --> 38:36.379
