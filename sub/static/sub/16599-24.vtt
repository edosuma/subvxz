05:45.879 --> 05:47.145
Yep.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.647

I don't think

05:49.682 --> 05:51.716

immunity and means in California

05:51.751 --> 05:53.785

I was part of that SEAL team

10:08.107 --> 10:09.273
that captured Salaam
ten years ago.

10:09.308 --> 10:11.709

10:11.744 --> 10:13.678
any useful intel
out of him.

10:13.713 --> 10:15.980

renditioned him? - Likes, no.

10:16.015 --> 10:17.782
Respects, maybe.

10:17.817 --> 10:19.183
The way I was able
to get that intel

10:19.218 --> 10:21.052
was by treating
him with dignity.

10:21.087 --> 10:22.387
And it goes a long way.

10:22.422 --> 10:23.788
Well, I'm sorry,
I'm not buying it.

10:23.823 --> 10:25.823
CHIN: I think the reason
we're all struggling

10:25.858 --> 10:28.793
with this is because this man
led his brothers in a holy war

10:28.828 --> 10:30.261
against America. To him,

10:30.296 --> 10:31.696
we're all infidels.

10:31.731 --> 10:33.131
So, (scoffs)
why would he suddenly

10:33.166 --> 10:34.432
start caring about saving us?

10:34.467 --> 10:36.334
We formed a bond, okay?

10:36.369 --> 10:37.802
During a time

10:37.837 --> 10:38.970
when nobody else would,

10:39.005 --> 10:41.039
I treated this man
with kindness.

10:41.074 --> 10:43.207
I believe that this,
this warning

10:43.242 --> 10:44.809
is Salaam's way
of returning that favor.

10:44.844 --> 10:46.811
KONO: Okay,
let's say you're right.

10:46.846 --> 10:48.112
Let's say
he's telling the truth.

10:48.147 --> 10:49.380
Did he say anything
about the attack

10:49.415 --> 10:51.683
that would help us stop it?
What he told me

10:51.718 --> 10:53.818
was two days ago, he had a brief
encounter with another prisoner.

10:53.853 --> 10:54.752
The guy would not
tell Salaam

10:54.788 --> 10:56.688
how he knew,
just that a terrorist attack

10:56.723 --> 10:58.956
was imminent on Oahu.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.057
CHIN: Is that it?
Nothing more specific

11:00.092 --> 11:02.193
about where and when this attack
was gonna take place?

11:02.228 --> 11:05.096
The only other thing
he said was "Cain Allah."

11:05.131 --> 11:06.097
All right, Allah means "God."

11:06.132 --> 11:07.799
Everybody knows that.
Wh-What does Cain mean?

11:07.834 --> 11:09.434
I don't know.
Salaam didn't know, either.

11:09.469 --> 11:10.735
KONO: Okay,
could that be the code name

11:10.770 --> 11:12.270
of the operative
or the operation itself?

11:12.305 --> 11:13.037
You know what, maybe DHS
has heard something.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.939
I've already
reached out to 'em.

11:14.974 --> 11:15.940
They said they heard
zero chatter

11:15.975 --> 11:17.041
about "Cain Allah"

11:17.076 --> 11:19.110
or an attack on Oahu.
KONO: Can't anyone question

11:19.145 --> 11:21.179
the prisoner that gave Salaam
the information?

11:21.214 --> 11:24.082
No, Salaam made it very clear
he's not gonna give that guy up.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.183
Okay, he took
a huge risk

11:25.218 --> 11:27.819
coming to me in the first place.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.887
He's not gonna risk the life
of a fellow prisoner,

11:29.922 --> 11:32.223
let alone his own, if he's
caught betraying the cause.

11:32.258 --> 11:34.058
Steve, you got to understand
how this sounds.

11:34.093 --> 11:35.493
It sounds like
he's making all this up

11:35.528 --> 11:37.261
because he needs to gain
some kind of leverage.

11:37.296 --> 11:38.429
I see what you're saying to me,

11:38.464 --> 11:39.997
but he didn't ask me
for anything.

11:40.032 --> 11:40.832
Yet.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.133
GROVER:
This guy

11:42.168 --> 11:45.002
has been at Gitmo for ten years.

11:45.037 --> 11:47.371
Perhaps he is giving you
misinformation

11:47.406 --> 11:49.507
because he's a damn terrorist.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.843
STEVE: Trust me, for
the past 15 hours,

11:51.878 --> 11:54.746
this is the only thing that's
been running through my head.

11:54.781 --> 11:56.080
All right?
Is it possible

11:56.115 --> 11:59.117
that Salaam is wrong about this?
Yes, it is.

11:59.152 --> 12:01.219
Is it possible
Salaam is lying to me? Sure.

12:01.254 --> 12:04.222
But let me float
something to you guys.

12:04.257 --> 12:05.790
What if he's not?

12:12.498 --> 12:14.499
♪ ♪

12:48.201 --> 12:49.967
STEVE:
Sorry it's...

12:50.002 --> 12:51.236
it's not halal.

13:03.482 --> 13:06.384
(Arabic music playing)

13:16.128 --> 13:16.961
(knock on door)

13:16.996 --> 13:18.196
Hey, you got a minute?

13:18.231 --> 13:19.997
Hey, yeah.
What do you got?

13:20.032 --> 13:21.432
I'm not exactly sure.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.935
I've been getting nowhere
with the phrase "Cain Allah,"

13:23.970 --> 13:26.304
mainly because the word "Cain"
doesn't exist in Arabic.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.872
Well, maybe it's not Arabic.

13:27.907 --> 13:29.540
Right. So I was thinking
that since the attack's

13:29.575 --> 13:30.741
supposed to take place here,

13:30.776 --> 13:33.978
that maybe the phrase is more
of a bastardized Hawaiian?

13:34.013 --> 13:35.246
Huh.
- And that Allah,

13:35.281 --> 13:36.113
instead of meaning "God,"

13:36.149 --> 13:38.482
actually means "a la,"
"the way of."

13:38.517 --> 13:40.384
And that Cain
would actually mean...

13:40.419 --> 13:43.054
Kane, god of the sky.
"The way of Kane."

13:43.089 --> 13:45.189
Exactly. So I did a search
on that phrase,

13:45.224 --> 13:47.925
and it turns out
that there is a travel agency

13:47.960 --> 13:49.927
here in Oahu with that name.
- Hmm.

13:49.962 --> 13:51.229
It's one of the last
brick-and-mortars.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.097
I suspect that they cater
to an older clientele,

13:53.132 --> 13:54.332
less Internet-savvy.

13:54.367 --> 13:55.933
And they supplement
their business

13:55.968 --> 13:58.369
by booking interisland cruises.
Is that right?

13:58.404 --> 14:01.606
I wonder if they supplement
their business any other way?

14:04.944 --> 14:06.410
KALEA:
Aloha,

14:06.445 --> 14:08.279
and mahalo for stopping in.

14:08.314 --> 14:09.914
Well, thank you.

14:09.949 --> 14:11.949
Are you the owner here?
- No.

14:11.984 --> 14:14.252
The owner isn't in,
but my name is Kalea,

14:14.287 --> 14:15.553
and I'd be happy
to assist you.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.321
Mmm.

14:17.356 --> 14:19.523
Let's start with some info.

14:19.558 --> 14:22.093
Is there a special occasion
you two are celebrating?

14:22.128 --> 14:23.161
Anniversary, perhaps?

14:23.196 --> 14:25.296
GROVER: I got your information
right here, Kalea.

14:25.331 --> 14:26.564
Five-O.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.132
KONO:
We want access

14:28.167 --> 14:29.267
to all your transaction records.

14:29.302 --> 14:30.902
Specifically, all travel
booked off and on

14:30.937 --> 14:32.003
the island
in the last six months.

14:32.038 --> 14:34.105
Hmm, I'm afraid
our computer system

14:34.140 --> 14:35.173
is down right now.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.441
It's gonna take some time to
gather all of that info.

14:37.476 --> 14:39.443
You know, we have
computer people for that.

14:39.478 --> 14:41.345
And I assume you have a warrant?

14:41.380 --> 14:42.413
GROVER:
What happened to, "Hey,

14:42.448 --> 14:43.981
aloha, mahalo"?

14:44.016 --> 14:45.583
You talking all this
warrant jazz, Kalea.

14:45.618 --> 14:49.120
Starting to make me think
you got something to hide.

14:49.155 --> 14:50.354
KONO:
Yeah, like, uh,

14:50.389 --> 14:52.323
what's behind
that door, maybe?

14:52.358 --> 14:54.158
The one with the
security camera?

14:54.193 --> 14:55.026
The safe is back there.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.060
I'm afraid

14:56.095 --> 14:57.595
the owner is a bit paranoid.

14:57.630 --> 15:00.031
In fact,
he keeps the door locked.

15:00.066 --> 15:01.699
He has the only key.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.301
A safe, huh?

15:03.336 --> 15:05.269
Well, since when
did a travel agency

15:05.304 --> 15:08.139
become such a high volume
cash business?

15:08.174 --> 15:09.073
Hmm?

15:26.092 --> 15:28.626
Stop. Hammer time.

15:31.063 --> 15:32.630
(handcuffs tighten)

15:32.665 --> 15:34.465
Well, you were right.

15:34.500 --> 15:35.433
This place is a front,

15:35.468 --> 15:38.402
but not for sneaking people
into the country.

15:38.437 --> 15:41.472
They're moving money.

15:41.507 --> 15:42.540
What do you got?
Well,

15:42.575 --> 15:44.308
two guys we arrested
aren't talking,

15:44.343 --> 15:45.609
but we have records
of all cash transactions

15:45.644 --> 15:46.978
handwritten in a ledger.

15:47.013 --> 15:48.346
In each case, the
money was transferred

15:48.381 --> 15:49.981
to a broker in
the Middle East.

15:50.016 --> 15:52.083
And that same amount
was then paid to somebody here.

15:52.718 --> 15:53.617
So, by the looks of it...

15:53.652 --> 15:55.720
This is a<i> hawala.</i>
- Yeah.

15:55.755 --> 15:58.422
There was a huge crackdown
on these places after 9/11.

15:58.457 --> 15:59.256
GROVER:
That's right.

15:59.291 --> 16:00.391
Feds thought
that places like this

16:00.426 --> 16:03.461
were used to facilitate funding
for terrorist activity.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.496
Okay, so Salaam's intel
might be good.

16:05.531 --> 16:06.564
Somebody in this ledger

16:06.599 --> 16:08.632
may have been sending money
to a terror network.

16:08.667 --> 16:10.101
That's certainly possible.

16:10.136 --> 16:11.469
All right, how many names
are in this ledger?

16:11.504 --> 16:12.770
Hundreds. I already
sent them to Chin,

16:12.805 --> 16:14.205
and he's running background
on them.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.473
And then, he's gonna
cross-check them

16:15.508 --> 16:16.541
against the Terror Watchlist.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.776
We need to vet these names
as quickly as possible.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.346
This has now officially
become a credible threat.

16:30.389 --> 16:32.390
(drink slurping)

16:35.061 --> 16:37.061
(slurping continues)

16:41.467 --> 16:42.467
Sorry.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.503
(sighs)
Okay.

16:45.538 --> 16:48.472
Just need to add
one more graph here.

16:48.507 --> 16:50.307
HIRSCH: Sure. Well,
if you don't think

16:50.342 --> 16:51.308
it'll be too distracting.

16:51.343 --> 16:53.177
Well, what
do you think?

16:53.212 --> 16:54.245
It's your business plan.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.179
I mean, personally?

16:55.215 --> 16:57.615
I think these changes
are all kind of...

16:57.650 --> 17:00.751
lateral, but
you're the expert.

17:00.786 --> 17:03.054
Hey, we can always go back
to what you had.

17:04.090 --> 17:05.223
No, no, no, no.

17:06.258 --> 17:08.092
You've worked hard.

17:08.127 --> 17:10.461
I don't want to
sound ungrateful.

17:10.496 --> 17:13.564
Even though, I don't
think it'll matter.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.100
Because you're an ex-con?

17:16.135 --> 17:17.768
Yes, because I'm an ex-con.

17:17.803 --> 17:20.604
You know what that's
like personally.

17:20.639 --> 17:22.406
Not everyone is like Kono,

17:22.441 --> 17:25.409
able to look past our
bad boy exteriors.

17:25.444 --> 17:28.512
(clears throat)
Let me ask you a question:

17:28.547 --> 17:30.314
have you tried leaning into it?

17:30.349 --> 17:32.349
What do you mean?

17:32.384 --> 17:35.119
I mean, they're gonna find out,
so there's no use denying it.

17:35.154 --> 17:37.288
Why not own it, right up front?

17:37.323 --> 17:40.424
Oh, sure, I should just
wear my orange jumpsuit

17:40.459 --> 17:42.159
to the interview,
and the leg chains.

17:42.194 --> 17:44.161
I'm serious.

17:44.196 --> 17:45.296
Look, make it a positive.

17:45.331 --> 17:46.831
Yes, you were incarcerated,

17:46.866 --> 17:49.500
but you've made the most
of your life since then.

17:49.535 --> 17:52.536
You found steady employment,
even started your own business.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.305
And your best
customers are Five-O,

17:54.340 --> 17:55.739
the same people
who arrested you.

17:55.774 --> 17:58.576
Now, if they believe in you,

17:58.611 --> 17:59.844
why shouldn't the bank?

18:01.547 --> 18:04.849
Wow. That's not bad.

18:04.884 --> 18:07.752
That's, uh... good.

18:08.787 --> 18:10.354
Thank you.

18:10.389 --> 18:11.755
That might even work.

18:11.790 --> 18:13.624
It will work, on someone.

18:13.659 --> 18:16.660
If not the first bank, then you
try the next, and the next.

18:16.695 --> 18:19.463
All you need is
one person to say yes.

18:19.498 --> 18:20.631
Yes.

18:20.666 --> 18:21.532
Yes...

18:21.567 --> 18:23.300
Exactly.

18:23.335 --> 18:24.234
(chuckles)

18:24.270 --> 18:27.571
Hey, I-I really appreciate
all your help.

18:27.606 --> 18:28.672
Oh.
- Uh,

18:28.707 --> 18:30.741
especially considering,
you know.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.309
No. What?

18:32.344 --> 18:34.578
Well, it must
be hard for you

18:34.613 --> 18:36.413
knowing that
I had feelings for Kono,

18:36.448 --> 18:38.849
and Kono felt the way
that she felt...

18:38.884 --> 18:41.252
for me.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.154
Right.
- I mean,

18:43.189 --> 18:44.755
if I'm being honest,

18:44.790 --> 18:48.692
if the situation were reversed,
I don't know if I could do it.

18:48.727 --> 18:50.628
Yeah, you know, it...
(chuckles)

18:50.663 --> 18:52.196
it is a struggle...
- Mm.

18:52.231 --> 18:53.831
...but I do it for-for her.

18:53.866 --> 18:54.832
Yeah.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.400
She's fond of you.

18:56.435 --> 18:58.435
(chuckles):
Oh, I know.

18:58.470 --> 18:59.670
N-Nothing happened

18:59.705 --> 19:01.305
while you were in
prison, by the way.

19:01.340 --> 19:02.940
It's important that
you understand that.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.343
That-that is a good woman
you have there.

19:06.512 --> 19:07.411
Very strong.

19:07.446 --> 19:08.245
Good to know.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.347
And I-I want to put
your mind at ease.

19:10.382 --> 19:11.782
If anything
should happen to you,

19:11.817 --> 19:13.684
I'd make sure Kono
was taken care of.

19:13.719 --> 19:16.287
Okay, okay, maybe we could
talk less about my wife

19:16.322 --> 19:17.521
and more about

19:17.556 --> 19:19.223
these graphs?

19:19.258 --> 19:20.691
Right, right,
the graphs.

19:20.726 --> 19:22.326
Love the graphs.

19:23.529 --> 19:24.662
More of them.

19:26.298 --> 19:28.666
(engine revs, tires screech)

19:28.701 --> 19:30.834
Yeah, Chin?
CHIN (over phone): All right,

19:30.869 --> 19:32.303
I've been running those names
from the<i> hawala's</i> ledger.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.371
And a lot of the people
are either

19:34.406 --> 19:36.574
in this country illegally
or have criminal records,

19:36.609 --> 19:38.442
but none of them are on
the Terrorist Watchlist.

19:38.477 --> 19:39.243
Okay.

19:39.278 --> 19:40.511
But there was one person

19:40.546 --> 19:41.579
who jumped out at me.

19:41.614 --> 19:43.948
A guy by the name
of Adnan Khalid.

19:43.983 --> 19:46.483
He's an associate professor
of international relations

19:46.518 --> 19:47.851
at Oahu State.

19:47.886 --> 19:50.354
Now, this guy is a
naturalized American citizen.

19:50.389 --> 19:51.422
He has no criminal record,

19:51.457 --> 19:52.756
he pays his taxes,

19:52.791 --> 19:54.458
he even gives to charity.
So what's the problem?

19:54.493 --> 19:56.393
Okay, well,
if he's so law-abiding,

19:56.428 --> 19:58.362
why is he running his money
through a<i> hawala?</i> CHIN: Exactly.

19:58.397 --> 19:59.964
And it's not just a few bucks.

19:59.999 --> 20:00.898
Khalid received
several transfers

20:00.934 --> 20:03.267
over the past few weeks
totaling well over

20:03.302 --> 20:04.668
$100,000.

20:04.703 --> 20:05.703
Oh, where's he live?

20:05.738 --> 20:07.304
Near the university.

20:07.339 --> 20:08.505
I'm sending you
the address right now.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.241
Copy that.
Have Kono meet us there.

20:10.276 --> 20:11.909
(engine revs)

20:25.057 --> 20:26.257
Clear.

20:27.426 --> 20:28.392
GROVER:
I'm clear.

20:28.427 --> 20:29.393
STEVE:
All clear.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.496
All right, he's not here.

20:32.531 --> 20:33.731
I got a laptop.

20:33.766 --> 20:35.399
Looks like he
left us a message.

20:38.437 --> 20:40.371
My name is Adnan Khalid.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.039
As you watch this,
I will already have gone

20:42.074 --> 20:44.008
into the light of Allah.

20:44.043 --> 20:45.843
The action taken
moments ago on Oahu

20:45.878 --> 20:49.847
is in response to your barbaric
deeds against Islam and Muslims,

20:49.882 --> 20:53.417
particularly our brother,
Turiq al-Mussawi,

20:53.452 --> 20:54.685
slaughtered in Kabul last week.

20:54.720 --> 20:55.853
Let the U.S.

20:55.888 --> 20:57.888
and all crusader nations

20:57.923 --> 21:00.457
cower in fear
of what is to come.

21:00.492 --> 21:02.293
This is just the beginning.

21:03.796 --> 21:05.629
Well, Salaam was
telling the truth.

21:05.664 --> 21:07.965
This guy is planning
an attack on Oahu.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.433
Kono...

21:09.468 --> 21:12.469
do we know when this video
was set to be uploaded?

21:12.504 --> 21:13.804
At 6:20 p.m. tonight.

21:13.839 --> 21:15.806
Means we got
a little less than

21:15.841 --> 21:17.308
three hours to figure out
what the target is.

21:26.618 --> 21:27.985
CIA OFFICER:
McGarrett.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.720
What?

21:29.755 --> 21:31.322
What do you think
you're doing?

21:31.357 --> 21:33.057
Sir?
- You were supposed to be

21:33.092 --> 21:33.858
interrogating
that prisoner.

21:33.893 --> 21:36.493
Correct.
By giving him a hot meal?

21:36.528 --> 21:39.430
Yeah, uh, they must've
forgotten to feed him,

21:39.465 --> 21:40.731
he hasn't eaten for a week.

21:40.766 --> 21:42.833
That's the point, Commander.

21:42.868 --> 21:44.601
Intel equals reward.

21:44.636 --> 21:45.535
Let me ask you a question,

21:45.571 --> 21:47.471
how we gonna get intel
out of a dead man?

21:47.506 --> 21:48.572
That prisoner's
lucky to be alive.

21:48.607 --> 21:51.475
And it's not by
the grace of God,

21:51.510 --> 21:52.743
but by the CIA.

21:52.778 --> 21:54.545
Your job is to

21:54.580 --> 21:56.680
remind him of that. He's been
out of play for six months.

21:56.715 --> 21:58.615
And not feed him and put
a carpet under his knees.

21:58.650 --> 21:59.850
He's got nothing
relevant to give us.

21:59.885 --> 22:01.485
We got the luxury of time

22:01.520 --> 22:02.620
to cultivate a
relationship right now.

22:03.789 --> 22:05.656
That man is our enemy!
- Yeah.

22:05.691 --> 22:07.458
You get that, right?!
Yeah, I get it.

22:07.493 --> 22:08.559
You keep treating him
like our enemy,

22:08.594 --> 22:09.927
he's gonna treat you
like his enemy.

22:09.962 --> 22:10.961
You get that?

22:10.997 --> 22:13.697
You know, before Commander
Baines shipped out,

22:13.732 --> 22:17.668
he got Salaam to admit his
complicity to two attacks.

22:17.703 --> 22:19.570
Mmm, I saw the footage.
Let me tell you something,

22:19.605 --> 22:21.038
you hold a man's head
under water for long enough,

22:21.073 --> 22:22.506
he'll tell you anything
you want to hear.

22:22.541 --> 22:24.108
But this one's different.

22:24.143 --> 22:25.709
You know what
your problem is?

22:25.744 --> 22:27.745
Why don't you tell me.

22:27.780 --> 22:29.813
You like to do
things your own way.

22:29.848 --> 22:32.583
You want to pull me
off of this?

22:32.618 --> 22:34.084
Mmm. - Yeah, well, until you do,

22:34.119 --> 22:36.487
why don't you stay out
of my face?

22:38.624 --> 22:40.391
It looks to me
like Khalid's

22:40.426 --> 22:42.059
dropped off the grid
over the last few days.

22:42.094 --> 22:43.994
His cell phone's off.

22:44.029 --> 22:45.429
I've been talking
to his neighbors,

22:45.464 --> 22:46.563
none of them
have seen him.

22:46.598 --> 22:47.865
You talk to the college
where he works?

22:47.900 --> 22:49.400
Yeah, I did. They haven't
seen him in months.

22:49.435 --> 22:50.567
He's on a sabbatical.

22:50.602 --> 22:52.503
And according
to travel records,

22:52.538 --> 22:54.104
he's been using that time

22:54.139 --> 22:56.039
to go back and forth,
to and from Turkey.

22:56.074 --> 22:57.608
Turkey?
- Turkey.

22:57.643 --> 22:59.042
That's where he could have
been radicalized. - Yeah.

22:59.077 --> 23:01.011
Kono is taking Khalid's
laptop to the lab.

23:01.046 --> 23:02.045
Jerry's gonna help her
go through it.

23:02.081 --> 23:03.547
Hopefully, they can find out
where this attack

23:03.582 --> 23:04.781
is gonna take place.

23:04.817 --> 23:08.152
But I got to tell you, man,
my gut is that this is military.

23:08.187 --> 23:09.620
Why you say that?

23:09.655 --> 23:10.954
'Cause in that video,

23:10.989 --> 23:12.890
Khalid said this attack
was payback

23:12.925 --> 23:16.493
for the death of
Turiq al-Mussawi, okay?

23:16.528 --> 23:19.196
Now, al-Mussawi was
taken out in a SEAL raid.

23:19.231 --> 23:20.664
Well, we got no shortage

23:20.699 --> 23:22.065
of military installations
here on this island.

23:22.100 --> 23:23.133
(phone rings)

23:23.168 --> 23:24.835
You get in touch with your
buddies and let them know

23:24.870 --> 23:26.069
to start tightening up security?
- They're on it.

23:26.104 --> 23:28.539
Yeah, Chin, you got me
and Grover. Go ahead.

23:28.574 --> 23:29.473
So I ran Khalid's credit cards,

23:29.509 --> 23:31.575
and it turns out he bought
a burner phone

23:31.610 --> 23:33.644
from a convenience store
three days ago.

23:33.679 --> 23:34.878
I got the number
from the manager.

23:34.913 --> 23:36.013
I'm pinging it right now.

23:36.048 --> 23:37.448
All right.

23:37.483 --> 23:39.883
CHIN: All right, I got a lock.
What do you got?

23:39.918 --> 23:41.819
Looks like he's at a mosque
in Manoa.

23:42.955 --> 23:44.455
GROVER: He could be
getting in

23:44.490 --> 23:45.923
his final prayers right
before the attack.

23:45.958 --> 23:47.425
Address is coming your way.

23:54.800 --> 23:57.534
(tires screech)

23:57.569 --> 23:58.301
GROVER:
Oh, that's good.

23:58.337 --> 24:00.037
They're just letting out
a service.

24:05.544 --> 24:07.110
STEVE:
You got anything yet?

24:07.145 --> 24:08.645
No.

24:08.680 --> 24:09.780
I don't see him.
CHIN (over radio): Steve?

24:09.815 --> 24:10.881
Yeah, go ahead, Chin.

24:10.916 --> 24:11.982
You got him?
Not yet.

24:12.017 --> 24:14.184
Steve, he's right
in front of you.

24:14.219 --> 24:15.519
He's right there.

24:15.554 --> 24:16.854
"Right there. Right there."

24:16.889 --> 24:17.921
There's 50 men right there.

24:17.956 --> 24:19.490
Call that burner phone.
Copy.

24:19.525 --> 24:21.058
(beeping)

24:21.093 --> 24:22.827
It's ringing.
(phone ringing)

24:23.962 --> 24:26.029
(phone ringing)
STEVE: Got him.

24:26.064 --> 24:27.131
I got him.

24:40.546 --> 24:42.012
(Grover panting)

24:42.047 --> 24:43.280
Oh, God. Where is he?

24:43.315 --> 24:44.615
Chin, where's he at?

24:44.650 --> 24:46.016
Uh, hold on.

24:46.051 --> 24:47.718
All right,
he's doubling back your way.

24:47.753 --> 24:49.052
He should be visible any second.

24:49.087 --> 24:50.921
(engine revving,
tires screeching)

24:54.593 --> 24:56.527
(car horn honks)

24:56.562 --> 24:57.728
(SUV horn honks)

25:12.144 --> 25:13.511
Wait, what the hell?

25:14.646 --> 25:15.646
That's not Khalid.

25:24.056 --> 25:26.189
KHALID (over laptop): The action
taken moments ago on Oahu

25:26.224 --> 25:29.293
is in response to your barbaric
deeds against Islam and Muslims.

25:30.762 --> 25:33.030
...is in response
to your barbaric deeds

25:33.065 --> 25:35.032
against Islam and Muslims.
(taps keyboard)

25:36.635 --> 25:39.269
...particularly our brother,
Turiq al-Mussawi,

25:39.304 --> 25:41.305
slaughtered in Kabul last week.

25:41.340 --> 25:43.607
...particularly our brother,
Turiq al-Mussawi,

25:43.642 --> 25:45.943
(taps keyboard)
...our brother Turiq al-Mussawi,

25:45.978 --> 25:48.045
...particularly our brother
Turiq al-Mussawi,

25:48.080 --> 25:50.847
(taps keyboard) ...slaughtered
in Kabul last week.

25:50.882 --> 25:52.683
(taps keyboard)

25:55.387 --> 25:57.654
Jerry, you finish going
through Khalid's laptop?

25:57.689 --> 25:58.888
Still going through it.

25:58.924 --> 26:00.724
So far, there's no information
on the nature of the attack

26:00.759 --> 26:01.625
or where it will take place.

26:01.660 --> 26:03.827
No, no, no... fine.
Was there anything...

26:03.862 --> 26:05.829
off about it?

26:05.864 --> 26:07.064
As a matter of fact, yes.

26:07.099 --> 26:08.365
Eric just called
from the lab.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.366
He says they believe

26:09.401 --> 26:11.301
the laptop may have been hacked.

26:11.336 --> 26:12.936
Specifically,
the browser history.

26:12.971 --> 26:15.138
Like all these websites
that Khalid visited,

26:15.173 --> 26:17.307
the ones that support the idea
that he'd been radicalized,

26:17.342 --> 26:19.309
it's possible that he
never logged onto them.

26:19.344 --> 26:21.011
It was just made to
look like he did.

26:21.046 --> 26:22.779
And what does that mean?

26:22.814 --> 26:25.148
I think this guy's being set up.
Jerry,

26:25.183 --> 26:27.651
we don't have time for any crazy
conspiracy theories right now;

26:27.686 --> 26:29.152
this attack is imminent.

26:29.187 --> 26:30.387
STEVE:
It's not crazy.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.956
This supports what I'm thinking.

26:32.991 --> 26:34.358
You actually believe
this guy's a patsy?

26:34.393 --> 26:36.126
(sighs)
- Okay,

26:36.161 --> 26:37.728
what about the video he made?
The video

26:37.763 --> 26:39.696
is what made me suspicious
in the first place--

26:39.731 --> 26:42.032
the strained voice,
the dilated pupils.

26:42.067 --> 26:44.901
When POWs are coerced
by the enemy

26:44.936 --> 26:46.870
to make statements
denouncing their own country,

26:46.905 --> 26:48.038
it looks like that.

26:48.073 --> 26:49.339
I've seen it before.

26:49.374 --> 26:50.340
JERRY: Manufacturing
visual evidence

26:50.375 --> 26:52.209
is pretty much par
for the course.

26:52.244 --> 26:54.745
I mean, it's like the doctored
photo of Oswald in his backyard

26:54.780 --> 26:57.247
with the Marxist paper,
the bolt-action rifle.

26:57.282 --> 26:59.116
All right, let's say
for the sake of argument

26:59.151 --> 27:01.318
that Khalid was forced
to make this video.

27:01.353 --> 27:02.419
Where is he now?

27:02.454 --> 27:04.421
STEVE: Well, he must be
being held captive somewhere.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.189
I mean, if he's not
a willing participant,

27:06.224 --> 27:08.659
they had to keep him away
from the authorities, right?

27:08.694 --> 27:09.526
Which would explain
why someone else

27:09.562 --> 27:10.694
took his burner phone
to the mosque,

27:10.730 --> 27:12.663
to make it look like he went
to pray before the attack.

27:12.698 --> 27:14.398
Exactly, right,
they create a clue trail

27:14.433 --> 27:17.000
that retroactively
points back to his guilt.

27:17.035 --> 27:19.870
Both of you are leaving
something out:

27:19.905 --> 27:21.838
who is "they"?

27:21.873 --> 27:22.772
Who's setting him up?

27:22.808 --> 27:24.207
And why would anybody
want us to believe

27:24.242 --> 27:26.143
that some local
college professor

27:26.178 --> 27:27.645
planning a terrorist attack?

27:29.981 --> 27:32.016
Where are you going now?

27:33.218 --> 27:35.752
We struck out I.D.'ing
the guy at the mosque.

27:35.787 --> 27:37.888
No hit on facial rec, and his
prints aren't in any system.

27:37.923 --> 27:38.989
What about the military?

27:39.024 --> 27:40.123
Not according to
our database.

27:40.158 --> 27:41.725
STEVE: The way
this guy evaded us,

27:41.760 --> 27:43.160
it's clear to me
he's had training,

27:43.195 --> 27:44.928
but since he's not in
the system, that means

27:44.963 --> 27:46.930
he's been scrubbed from it;
he's a ghost.

27:47.966 --> 27:49.833
CHIN: We may have
just caught a break.

27:49.868 --> 27:51.835
Crime lab just unlocked
that burner phone

27:51.870 --> 27:53.470
bought with Khalid's
credit card.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.105
It came up with these
pictures on it.

27:55.140 --> 27:56.740
STEVE: These look
like recon images.

27:56.775 --> 27:58.875
This could be where the attack's
gonna take place.

27:58.910 --> 28:00.877
Yeah, this would make sense
as part of the clue trail

28:00.912 --> 28:01.878
these people were leaving
to frame Khalid.

28:01.913 --> 28:03.914
GROVER: That looks like
an office building.

28:03.949 --> 28:04.848
Where is that?

28:04.884 --> 28:06.750
(beeping)
Running a reverse image search.

28:06.785 --> 28:09.319
(computer trilling)

28:09.354 --> 28:10.987
(beeps)
You're right.

28:11.022 --> 28:12.256
Old office building downtown.

28:13.058 --> 28:13.990
Liliha Street.

28:14.025 --> 28:14.991
GROVER:
An office building

28:15.026 --> 28:18.261
for a terrorist attack
at that time of the day?

28:18.296 --> 28:20.430
It's 6:20 p.m.
Most of the people who'd

28:20.465 --> 28:22.899
be in that building has
already gone home for the day.

28:22.934 --> 28:24.501
Wait, what about
military buildings?

28:24.536 --> 28:26.903
A-Any military buildings
in the area?

28:26.938 --> 28:27.971
Negative.

28:28.006 --> 28:30.006
This doesn't make any sense.
STEVE: No, it doesn't.

28:30.041 --> 28:31.875
But the attack's less than
30 minutes from now.

28:31.910 --> 28:33.310
This is the best lead we've got.

28:33.345 --> 28:34.511
Chin, call building management,

28:34.546 --> 28:35.912
have them evacuate anybody
still inside.

28:35.947 --> 28:37.481
On it.

28:39.184 --> 28:40.283
(engine revs, tires screech)

28:40.319 --> 28:42.853
CHIN: You're gonna love this:
that building is empty.

28:42.888 --> 28:45.155
It's been shut down all week
for scheduled repairs.

28:45.190 --> 28:46.423
Why take out an empty building?

28:46.458 --> 28:48.291
Chin, is there anything
about any of the tenants

28:48.326 --> 28:49.760
that could make it
a likely target?

28:49.795 --> 28:51.495
No, not that I can tell.

28:51.530 --> 28:54.131
This thing isn't right.
I think this is a diversion

28:54.166 --> 28:56.299
to get us away from where
the attack is really happening.

28:56.334 --> 28:57.267
I don't think so.

28:57.302 --> 28:59.069
We weren't even supposed
to find those photos

28:59.104 --> 29:00.537
until after the attack
already happened.

29:00.572 --> 29:02.439
Chin's right, if it wasn't
for Salaam's intel,

29:02.474 --> 29:04.307
we wouldn't be on this thing
ahead of time.

29:04.342 --> 29:06.210
There's got to be something
about that building.

29:07.879 --> 29:09.513
Wait, hold on a second.
What?

29:09.548 --> 29:11.348
I think I figured this thing
out; look at that plane.

29:11.383 --> 29:13.350
STEVE: That plane is flying
right over where we're headed.

29:13.385 --> 29:17.120
Which means that building is
directly under the flight path

29:17.155 --> 29:19.156
of planes that are landing
at the Honolulu Airport.

29:19.191 --> 29:20.791
Chin, you got any flights
coming in to Honolulu

29:20.826 --> 29:22.760
at 6:20?
CHIN: Hold on, checking.

29:23.528 --> 29:25.562
