What are you doing here?

A man uses
a bomb to rob a bank?

03:19.503 --> 03:23.551
I mean, this-this is...baroque,
mysterious even.

03:23.638 --> 03:24.987
What do we know?

03:25.074 --> 03:26.815
Well, for starters,
it wasn't a bank.

03:26.902 --> 03:29.600
Dinkler robbed his employer.
It was a Cash in Motion store.

03:29.687 --> 03:31.776
Cash in Motion?
Sounds like a game show.

03:31.863 --> 03:33.952
It's a payday loan
and money transfer chain.

03:34.039 --> 03:35.824
People use 'em to wire money
all over the world.

03:35.911 --> 03:38.740
It's a cash business but it's
got less security than a bank.

03:38.827 --> 03:40.089
Nice, soft target.

03:40.176 --> 03:41.438
Dinkler got away
with 50 grand.

03:43.048 --> 03:45.137
Almost got away
with 50 grand.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.096
Yeah, well,
he stopped for gas

spotted him.

only killed himself.

03:57.933 --> 03:59.935
Director Bertram.
Let me ask you something.

04:00.022 --> 04:02.807
If Director Bertram
wanted a CBI presence

04:02.894 --> 04:06.246
to jump off a cliff,
would you and your CBI presence

04:06.333 --> 04:07.769
jump off that cliff?

04:07.856 --> 04:09.597
If there was overtime, sure.

04:11.294 --> 04:12.252
That's very sad.

He was, uh,
making gestures at me.

04:27.310 --> 04:29.791
Yeah, pointing at me like that.

04:41.846 --> 04:44.893

you remember about the bomber?

04:44.980 --> 04:46.677
I thought I was dead.

04:46.764 --> 04:50.115
I saw the bomb around his waist
and I thought this is it.

04:50.202 --> 04:51.639
I'm dead.

'Lisbon?'

05:06.175 --> 05:07.698

This is horrible.

05:37.902 --> 05:39.730
Horrible.

High impact visuals like this

05:41.645 --> 05:43.212

the story for days.

05:43.299 --> 05:45.475
Yes, I've got a wolf pack
of journalists outside.

05:45.562 --> 05:47.085
What do you have, J.J.?

05:47.172 --> 05:49.044
Agent Lisbon?

05:49.131 --> 05:51.916
Alan Dinkler,
27-years-old, no priors.

05:52.003 --> 05:54.919
'He robbed his employer,
a Cash in Motion store.'

05:55.006 --> 05:57.444
Walked into his boss' office,
showed him the bomb

05:57.531 --> 05:58.749
demanded to be let
into the vault.

05:58.836 --> 06:00.969
He got $50,000.

06:01.056 --> 06:02.884
We believe that Dinkler
was the victim here

06:02.971 --> 06:05.495
that he was abducted,
put into the bomb jacket

06:05.582 --> 06:07.541
and coerced into
committing the crime.

06:07.628 --> 06:09.673
The bomb squad confirms
that the device was activated

06:09.760 --> 06:10.979
'by remote control.'

06:11.066 --> 06:12.589
Awful. That poor, poor man..

06:12.676 --> 06:14.330
...used as a puppet.

06:14.417 --> 06:18.029
But...the thing is, the person
behind this wants money

06:18.116 --> 06:19.596
so this is not terrorism, right?

06:19.683 --> 06:21.424
It doesn't look that way, sir.

06:21.511 --> 06:24.340
His plan didn't work,
but only through bad luck.

06:24.427 --> 06:26.647
We strongly expect
the perpetrator will try again.

06:26.734 --> 06:28.257
It's guesswork.

06:28.344 --> 06:30.390
Not a terrorist
is what I'll be leading with.

06:30.477 --> 06:33.262
Isolated incident, CBI in charge
of a swift and thorough.

06:33.349 --> 06:34.306
Et cetera, et cetera.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.482
That's just right, sir.

06:35.569 --> 06:37.048
Thank you all.

06:37.135 --> 06:39.311
Let my assistant
know if there's anything new.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.142
- 'Hey, boss.'
- What've we got?

06:44.229 --> 06:46.536
Device used
a plastic explosive called PE4

06:46.623 --> 06:49.278
stable, hard to acquire,
very deadly.

06:49.365 --> 06:50.801
Usually in human bombs
like this

06:50.888 --> 06:52.760
there's ball bearings
or such like within the device

06:52.847 --> 06:54.762
used to create maximum damage
to bystanders.

06:54.849 --> 06:56.198
In this case, no.

06:56.285 --> 06:58.374
Just deadly in a 10-foot radius
around the bomb.

06:58.461 --> 07:00.898
So forensics recovered
the 50 grand from Dinkler's car

07:00.985 --> 07:02.987
plus some fast food wrappers
and a couple of writeable CDs

07:03.074 --> 07:04.815
from Cash in Motion, other crap.

07:04.902 --> 07:06.556
Anything
on Dinkler's cellphone?

07:06.643 --> 07:09.124
It's badly damaged, but the lab
is trying to salvage the chip.

07:09.211 --> 07:10.778
They'll let us know
soon as they get the results.

07:10.865 --> 07:12.997
Good, the cellphone is probably

07:13.084 --> 07:15.957
how the bomber
communicated with Dinkler.

07:16.044 --> 07:17.654
'Rigsby, Van Pelt,
you guys go and talk'

07:17.741 --> 07:19.090
'to Dinkler's co-workers.'

07:19.177 --> 07:21.658
Cho, you and I will go
to his apartment.

07:21.745 --> 07:23.834
Dinkler left work
last night at 5:30.

07:23.921 --> 07:26.489
At 8:00 a.m. he went back
and robbed the place.

07:26.576 --> 07:29.013
Sometime in between,
someone put a bomb on him.

07:29.100 --> 07:30.667
So we track backwards

07:30.754 --> 07:32.495
try and figure out when somebody
could have done that.

07:32.582 --> 07:35.411
If we find out when,
maybe we'll find out who.

07:35.498 --> 07:36.717
- Let's go.
- Okay.

07:37.935 --> 07:40.808
[instrumental music]

07:51.558 --> 07:52.776

07:52.863 --> 07:54.691
Looking for
your manager, Mr. Vermillion.

07:54.778 --> 07:57.389
Oh, he's talking
with the other agent.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.782
- I'll buzz you in.
- Other agent?

07:58.869 --> 08:00.436
[buzzing]

08:00.523 --> 08:01.481
Thank you.

08:05.789 --> 08:08.009
Rigsby, Van Pelt,
join the party.

08:08.096 --> 08:10.838
Lisbon's been looking for you.
What are you doing here?

08:10.925 --> 08:12.274
Ah, curious.

08:12.361 --> 08:14.276
Putting an explosive
on someone

08:14.363 --> 08:15.320
it's unsporting,
don't you think?

08:15.407 --> 08:16.844
Don't you think?

08:16.931 --> 08:20.325
Uh.. Alan's loss is
very upsetting to all of us

08:20.412 --> 08:21.675
in the Cash in Motion family.

08:21.762 --> 08:23.328
[Patrick]
'Cash in Motion family, right.'

08:23.415 --> 08:29.334
Oh, this is Drake Vermilion,
clearly an alias, who knows why?

08:29.421 --> 08:31.206
Thwarted show business
aspirations

08:31.293 --> 08:33.034
or just an unfortunate
birth name.

08:33.121 --> 08:34.470
What-what is it?

08:34.557 --> 08:37.778
Uh, I-I don't think
that's germane, do you?

08:37.865 --> 08:41.738
Ooh, germane.
Definitely showbiz.

08:41.825 --> 08:45.176
I had a very successful career
in the musical theater actually.

08:45.263 --> 08:47.439
Of course you did, Drake.
Can you belt out a tune for us?

08:47.527 --> 08:49.833
[chuckles]

08:49.920 --> 08:51.052
Ah.

08:51.139 --> 08:52.967
Smiling now, is it, Tracy?

08:53.054 --> 08:55.099
'All that sniveling,
and now you smile?'

08:55.186 --> 08:56.492
What, I amuse you, do I?

08:56.579 --> 08:58.233
- No, sir.
- Oh, no, sir, she says.

08:58.320 --> 08:59.408
Hey, now everyone's
a little stressed out here

08:59.495 --> 09:01.105
it's understandable.

09:01.192 --> 09:02.498
Would you people please
just get to the point here?

09:02.585 --> 09:04.500
The point. Yes, Drake.

09:05.806 --> 09:07.851
Uh.. Sir, that is
a restricted area.

09:07.938 --> 09:09.549
[Patrick]
'Oh. Let's sing that.'

09:14.902 --> 09:17.121
Dinkler took the money
from this vault.

09:17.208 --> 09:20.342
Yes. Uh, he made
me open it for him.

09:22.039 --> 09:23.780
[beeps]

09:25.521 --> 09:28.829
And he made Tracy and me
go inside the vault with him

09:28.916 --> 09:30.570
while he shoveled money
into a bag.

09:30.657 --> 09:32.006
Then he locked us in the vault.

09:32.093 --> 09:33.355
He probably thought
we would suffocate.

09:33.442 --> 09:34.574
No, he knew
there was ventilation.

09:34.661 --> 09:35.749
He knew we'd be alright.

09:35.836 --> 09:38.273
Oh. You-you think that, do you?

09:38.360 --> 09:40.188
Wait, do you have
some special insight here?

09:40.275 --> 09:41.493
- No, s--
- Did he talk to you?

09:41.581 --> 09:43.060
- No, sir.
- Oh, no, sir.

09:43.147 --> 09:45.933
But he was a good person.
He wouldn't wanna hurt anyone.

09:46.020 --> 09:49.676
Hmm. Thank you, Tracy.
Useful to know.

09:49.763 --> 09:52.635
Wait. You-you cannot
go in there alone.

09:52.722 --> 09:54.506
Tracy, can you show me
Dinkler's work space?

09:55.986 --> 09:59.294
- How much money is this?
- '$10,000.'

09:59.381 --> 10:02.253
Wow. He left a lot
more than he took.

10:02.340 --> 10:03.733
In a hurry, I suppose.

10:03.820 --> 10:04.734
Oh, look.

10:06.823 --> 10:10.914
Two seconds. $50,000.
How much time did he need?

10:11.001 --> 10:12.568
Did he take anything else?

10:12.655 --> 10:13.874
I-I-I don't know.

10:13.961 --> 10:15.527
I-I had my eyes closed
to be honest.

10:15.615 --> 10:16.877
Put that back.

10:20.707 --> 10:22.578
Where were you standing
in here exactly?

10:24.014 --> 10:25.537
Exactly.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.278
Uh...here.

10:27.365 --> 10:29.846
I was here and-and
Tracy was here.

10:29.933 --> 10:32.849
Mm-hmm. And when he exited,
did he exit facing you

10:32.936 --> 10:34.721
or did he have his back to you?

10:34.808 --> 10:36.157
Facing us,
just like you're doing now.

10:36.244 --> 10:37.201
Oh, he did.

10:38.725 --> 10:40.509
Then what did Dinkler do?

10:40.596 --> 10:42.642
- He shut the door.
- Oh, like this?

10:42.729 --> 10:44.992
Yes, exactly like that.

10:45.079 --> 10:46.558
Thank you.
Thanks for your help.

10:46.646 --> 10:47.864
[Drake]
'Wait, no! Wait, wait.'

10:47.951 --> 10:50.127
[knock on door]

10:50.214 --> 10:52.564
'Oh, come on!'

10:52.652 --> 10:54.828
Tracy, there were
some CDs in Alan's car

10:54.915 --> 10:57.004
that contained these lists.

10:57.091 --> 10:59.093
[Tracy]
'Oh, these are
client transaction reports'

10:59.180 --> 11:00.572
from the past two months.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.357
Alan must have gotten them
from the vault.

11:02.444 --> 11:04.315
We're not allowed to see them.

11:04.402 --> 11:05.708
But they could be valuable

11:05.795 --> 11:07.449
like bank account,
or credit card data?

11:07.536 --> 11:10.017
No, no, account info is
encrypted on a separate system.

11:10.104 --> 11:12.410
These are just names of clients
who sent money and locations

11:12.497 --> 11:13.673
they sent it to.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.849
It's not worth anything,
I don't think.

11:18.634 --> 11:22.203
I'm.. Alan just kept apologizing

11:22.290 --> 11:24.771
when he first came in,
and I didn't know

11:24.858 --> 11:27.643
what was going on at first,
why he kept saying

11:27.730 --> 11:30.690
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.692
Well..

11:32.779 --> 11:33.910
...you've had a rough day, huh?

11:33.997 --> 11:35.172
Why don't you
head off home, Tracy?

11:35.259 --> 11:38.698
Get yourself some rest.
We're done here.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.961
Yeah, I'm sorry,
I couldn't be more helpful.

11:41.048 --> 11:42.658
Oh, no, on the contrary

11:42.745 --> 11:45.443
you've practically solved
the case single-handedly.

11:45.530 --> 11:47.315
- I have?
- Yeah, you have.

11:47.402 --> 11:48.359
She has?

11:52.929 --> 11:55.627
Okay. Any suspicious vehicles?
Drive-bys?

11:55.715 --> 11:57.891
[male #2]
'Not a one.'

11:57.978 --> 11:59.153
Alright.
Thanks for the help.

12:01.459 --> 12:02.765
Sergeant says he's been sitting

12:02.852 --> 12:04.114
on Dinkler's place
since the incident.

12:04.201 --> 12:06.508
He knocked, no answer.
Nobody's been in or out.

12:06.595 --> 12:07.857
Dinkler had a roommate?

12:07.944 --> 12:09.816
Yeah, a deadbeat
according to the landlord.

12:09.903 --> 12:11.078
Always home.

12:13.297 --> 12:14.559
Check the garage.
I got the back.

12:14.646 --> 12:15.604
Alright.

12:18.433 --> 12:20.348
[dog barking]

12:23.830 --> 12:24.744
[gun cocks]

12:31.272 --> 12:32.229
Hello?

12:33.578 --> 12:34.536
Police.

12:38.105 --> 12:39.976
[dramatic music]

13:07.003 --> 13:08.048
[cat meowing]

13:14.619 --> 13:15.795
Ugh!

13:19.973 --> 13:23.541
Cho, I think I've got somethin'.

13:23.628 --> 13:25.152
[Kimball]
'Hey, boss.Be right there.'

13:39.557 --> 13:41.646
[dramatic music]

13:43.997 --> 13:46.521
[Teresa]
'Cho, get in here.
We got a body.'

13:53.006 --> 13:53.963
Roommate?

13:54.050 --> 13:56.052
[Teresa]
'Looks like.'

13:56.139 --> 13:57.837
Gunshot to the head.

14:02.145 --> 14:04.017
[cellphone ringing]

14:06.454 --> 14:08.412
Where have you been?

14:08.499 --> 14:11.502
Oh. Uh, you know, out, about.

14:11.589 --> 14:13.417
Oh, that's good
because we just found

14:13.504 --> 14:14.854
'a body at Dinkler's house.'

14:16.551 --> 14:17.987
Huh. Figures.

14:18.074 --> 14:19.684
You wanna come
and have a look, maybe?

14:19.771 --> 14:22.035
- 'Do a little detective work?'
- Not really.

14:22.122 --> 14:23.340
'I'm pretty sure it's
collateral damage.

14:23.427 --> 14:24.994
'Roommate, probably.'

14:25.081 --> 14:27.692
Hey, why don't you come by
the office and I will show you

14:27.779 --> 14:29.172
what the real motive is
behind the crime?

14:29.259 --> 14:31.696
- And it wasn't money.
- No? Well, what was it?

14:31.783 --> 14:34.482
Oh, and while I think of it,
could you send Sac PD to check

14:34.569 --> 14:36.440
on the Cash in Motion offices?

14:36.527 --> 14:37.528
[Teresa]
'Why?'

14:41.750 --> 14:42.707
[Drake]
'Hello?'

14:44.144 --> 14:45.101
'Hello?'

14:46.494 --> 14:47.712
'Can anyone hear me?'

14:49.453 --> 14:50.411
'Anyone?'

15:00.464 --> 15:03.032
So,you know the real motive
for the robbery?

15:03.119 --> 15:04.251
What's up
with the dead roommate?

15:04.338 --> 15:05.948
Michael Takashima.

15:06.035 --> 15:08.124
Coroner says he's been dead
just under 24 hours.

15:08.211 --> 15:11.388
So killed last night
way before the robbery.

15:11.475 --> 15:13.173
Killer put the bomb
on Dinkler in the house.

15:13.260 --> 15:15.827
Roommate probably came home,
had to be disposed of.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.178
Yeah. Uh, don't keep
me in suspense.

15:18.265 --> 15:21.311
What's the motive
if it wasn't about the money?

15:21.398 --> 15:24.140
Dinkler left as much as he took
and half as much again

15:24.227 --> 15:25.925
just left it there in the vault.

15:26.012 --> 15:27.187
Why?

15:27.274 --> 15:28.231
That's weird.

15:29.493 --> 15:31.147
His life was on the line.

15:31.234 --> 15:33.062
He'd been careful to do
what the killer told him.

15:33.149 --> 15:36.196
So the killer must have told him
the money wasn't the object.

15:36.283 --> 15:38.372
Told him steal the money
to hide the real theft.

15:38.459 --> 15:39.851
And what's the real theft?

15:39.939 --> 15:41.244
The list of customers
on the CDs he took.

15:41.331 --> 15:42.854
Oh, yeah?

15:42.942 --> 15:44.204
Well, the CDs are the only
other thing he took.

15:44.291 --> 15:47.120
Ergo, that was what
he was after.

15:47.207 --> 15:49.600
Two thousand or so names
of people that had sent

15:49.687 --> 15:52.342
money orders via that store
and where they'd sent them.

15:52.429 --> 15:55.345
- Why would he want that?
- Haven't figured that out yet.

15:55.432 --> 15:57.652
Frankly, this is less thrilling
than you advertised

15:57.739 --> 15:59.262
and possibly wrong.

15:59.349 --> 16:01.090
No, he wanted that list.

16:01.177 --> 16:03.005
Okay, I'll have
the clerical staff

16:03.092 --> 16:04.789
run the list of names,
see if anything pops.

16:04.876 --> 16:06.443
Something will.

16:06.530 --> 16:07.705
Here's an odd thing.

16:07.792 --> 16:10.491
Dinkler's car's gas tank
was nearly full.

16:10.578 --> 16:12.493
Maybe he filled it
at the gas station.

16:12.580 --> 16:13.973
Nope, never activated the pump.

16:15.235 --> 16:16.888
Then why would he stop there?

16:16.976 --> 16:17.933
Hmm.

16:19.282 --> 16:21.284
[Grace]
'Hey, Craig.'

16:21.371 --> 16:22.851
Excuse me, boss,
you mind if I..

16:22.938 --> 16:24.940
- No, go ahead.
- Thanks. Sorry.

16:26.507 --> 16:27.812
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

16:27.899 --> 16:29.901
I was across the street
for a prelim.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.860
- Just wanted to say hey.
- Hey.

16:31.947 --> 16:33.209
You working
the mad bomber case, huh?

16:33.296 --> 16:36.473
Yep. It's a weird one.
No real breaks yet.

16:36.560 --> 16:37.518
They'll come.

16:39.172 --> 16:42.436
Look, I, uh...got a little
surprise for you.

16:42.523 --> 16:45.874
- Kind of a pre-wedding gift.
- I love surprises.

16:45.961 --> 16:46.918
[gasps]

16:49.921 --> 16:51.662
Oh, it's beautiful.

16:52.707 --> 16:54.274
Oh!

16:54.361 --> 16:55.318
It was my mother's.

16:56.102 --> 16:57.146
[gasps]

16:57.233 --> 16:58.887
- You like it?
- I love it.

16:58.974 --> 17:00.323
Here. Let me do it for you.

17:04.675 --> 17:05.936
How's it look?

17:06.025 --> 17:07.852
Looks great.

17:07.939 --> 17:09.376
Oh, I love you.

17:13.728 --> 17:15.730
[Teresa]
'Jane and I are going back
to the gas station.'

17:15.817 --> 17:17.036
Check with the lab
about the cellphone.

17:17.123 --> 17:18.950
Yes, boss.

17:20.647 --> 17:22.867
[chuckles]

17:22.954 --> 17:24.694
Alright.
I'll see you later.

17:24.781 --> 17:25.695
- Okay.
- Alright.

17:27.175 --> 17:30.266
More questions?
Everyone has more questions.

17:30.353 --> 17:33.487
Chit-chat, chit-chat, police,
journalists, more police.

17:33.574 --> 17:35.010
Makes work very difficult.

17:35.097 --> 17:36.664
We'll try and be brief.

17:36.751 --> 17:38.666
Just wanna ask
about Dinkler, the bomber.

17:38.753 --> 17:39.971
Did he say anything?

17:40.059 --> 17:42.191
Indicate why
he was here, maybe?

17:42.278 --> 17:44.498
He asked
for the restroom key.

17:44.585 --> 17:46.456
That is why I thought
he was so agitated.

17:46.543 --> 17:48.284
'He needs to urinate.'

17:48.371 --> 17:50.286
But no, he did not.

17:50.373 --> 17:51.287
Can we have it?

17:52.854 --> 17:54.290
What?

17:54.377 --> 17:56.075
The restroom key, please.

17:57.728 --> 17:58.686
Yes.

18:11.525 --> 18:12.700
Why would he come in here?

18:14.267 --> 18:17.052
Well, maybe he just needed
to go to the bathroom.

18:17.139 --> 18:18.662
Stress will do that to you.

18:20.490 --> 18:22.057
Ah. Or..

18:23.754 --> 18:25.669
Huh? "A.D."

18:26.714 --> 18:28.542
Alan Dinkler.

18:28.629 --> 18:31.893
"297A6 Windsor."

18:31.980 --> 18:34.330
Location maybe?
Where to go next?

18:34.417 --> 18:35.853
Yeah.

18:35.940 --> 18:38.465
Scavenger hunt.
Interesting.

18:38.552 --> 18:40.119
Let's not jump
to conclusions.

18:41.685 --> 18:42.599
Excuse me?

18:42.686 --> 18:43.600
- Sir?
- Yes?

18:43.687 --> 18:45.776
Does that mean anything to you?

18:45.863 --> 18:49.084
'"AD-297A6 Windsor?"'

18:49.171 --> 18:51.521
Half an hour
of villainous scrubbing

18:51.608 --> 18:53.393
and this sort of ink
never comes out entirely.

18:54.829 --> 18:56.222
Scavenger hunt then.

18:56.309 --> 18:57.223
Okay.

19:01.662 --> 19:03.968
"297A6 Windsor."

19:04.055 --> 19:05.361
Maybe an address?

19:05.448 --> 19:07.624
We got a Windsor Drive, a, uh

19:07.711 --> 19:10.410
Windsor Lane,
and a Windsor Point Way.

19:11.411 --> 19:12.412
A6?

19:12.499 --> 19:14.196
Like an apartment?

19:14.283 --> 19:16.590
Kind of a low street number.
I'm betting map coordinates.

19:16.677 --> 19:17.634
But which map?

19:17.721 --> 19:19.245
Good question.

19:19.332 --> 19:21.464
I generated a list
of possible locations

19:21.551 --> 19:24.685
using pretty much
every road map online.

19:24.772 --> 19:26.774
Triple-A, USGS.

19:26.861 --> 19:29.429
There's a whole bunch
of possibilities.

19:29.516 --> 19:31.779
Divvy up the list by proximity
to the gas station.

19:31.866 --> 19:33.476
We need to run down
every one of those locations.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.304
Okay.

19:40.266 --> 19:41.484
Any revelations?

19:41.571 --> 19:44.270
No. Scavenger hunt,
secret codes.

19:44.357 --> 19:46.054
I just can't seem
to put my finger on it.

19:46.141 --> 19:48.404
It's all so, uh, so..

19:48.491 --> 19:51.190
- Baroque? Mysterious even?
- Yes.

19:51.277 --> 19:52.713
I thought you liked
that sort of thing.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.889
I do, very much.

19:54.976 --> 19:57.370
Any progress
to report, agent?

19:57.457 --> 19:58.762
Uh, yes, sir.

19:58.849 --> 20:00.547
We're moving
forward on several fronts.

20:00.634 --> 20:02.375
Right now we're working
on getting the location

20:02.462 --> 20:04.681
of a rendezvous that Dinkler
was meant to be at.

20:04.768 --> 20:07.554
Is there something concrete
I can tell Bertram?

20:07.641 --> 20:09.904
[Teresa]
'Not really, sir.'

20:09.991 --> 20:11.297
Hmm.

20:11.384 --> 20:12.602
Thank you, Lisbon.

20:14.474 --> 20:15.388
[Patrick]
'Bye.'

20:16.432 --> 20:18.086
God, I miss Hightower.

20:18.173 --> 20:21.045
Aside from the murder stuff,
obviously.

20:21.132 --> 20:22.699
Uh, Screw it.
Even with the murder stuff

20:22.786 --> 20:24.658
how does he just appear
out of nowhere like that?

20:24.745 --> 20:26.660
He's a ghost from
the fifth dimension.

20:26.747 --> 20:28.270
- Right, Rigsby?
- He's the boss.

20:28.357 --> 20:29.706
Not going there.

20:29.793 --> 20:31.578
Divvied up the list.
This is your share.

20:31.665 --> 20:33.319
Thanks. Are you coming?

20:33.406 --> 20:34.624
Hmm.

20:34.711 --> 20:37.018
Come along
on a methodical grinding search

20:37.105 --> 20:41.892
through Sacramento County,
or rearrange my sock drawer..

20:41.979 --> 20:44.852
I'll go with the or.
Thanks.

20:44.939 --> 20:46.375
- Have fun with it.
- Thank you.

20:49.944 --> 20:51.815
[cellphone ringing]

20:54.992 --> 20:57.473
- Lisbon.
- 'Hi, boss.'

20:57.560 --> 20:59.910
No luck at Windsor Lane,
or Windsor Arms Pub

20:59.997 --> 21:02.696
and Cho and Rigsby
haven't found anything yet.

21:02.783 --> 21:04.785
Same here.

21:04.872 --> 21:06.613
And more bad news
about the cellphone

21:06.700 --> 21:08.745
from Dinkler's car,
apparently the killer

21:08.832 --> 21:10.660
routed all calls
through China and back.

21:10.747 --> 21:13.010
There's no way to trace
where they originated.

21:13.097 --> 21:15.099
Great. Thanks.

21:15.186 --> 21:16.753
Oh, but good news.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.320
The dresses are ready
at the tailor's.

21:18.407 --> 21:19.408
You can pick
yours up anytime.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.630
Boss?

21:23.717 --> 21:25.196
[Teresa]
'My dress.'

21:25.284 --> 21:27.764
Yes. Right.

21:27.851 --> 21:30.289
The satin bow looks gorgeous.
I can't wait to see it on you.

21:31.986 --> 21:33.640
Great. Well, thank you.

21:33.727 --> 21:34.858
'Goodnight.'

21:34.945 --> 21:35.903
Night.

21:37.948 --> 21:39.820
[cellphone ringing]

21:40.777 --> 21:41.909
Yeah?

21:41.996 --> 21:43.606
[Patrick]
'Hi, Captain Ahab.'

21:44.564 --> 21:45.913
How goes the hunt?

21:46.000 --> 21:48.655
Done. I'm practically done.
One more.

21:48.742 --> 21:51.048
Windsor High School.
It's over on Alameda.

21:51.135 --> 21:52.789
'Shut down
a couple of years ago.'

21:52.876 --> 21:56.010
Hmm. That's kind
of an iffy area.

21:56.097 --> 21:58.578
You have, uh,
plenty of harpoons?

21:58.665 --> 22:00.928
I've got
a few 9-millimeter ones

22:01.015 --> 22:04.018
but if it looks hinky,
I'll call for backup.

22:04.105 --> 22:05.498
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

22:12.461 --> 22:13.375
[clears throat]

22:16.770 --> 22:18.554
[instrumental music]

22:41.577 --> 22:42.491
Hey, Lisbon?

22:43.840 --> 22:45.755
I was in the neighborhood.

22:45.842 --> 22:47.540
So I thought I'd drop by.

22:47.627 --> 22:48.932
[rattling]

22:53.023 --> 22:53.981
'Lisbon?'

22:57.332 --> 22:58.594
Lisbon?

23:26.622 --> 23:28.494
[dramatic music]

23:44.292 --> 23:45.249
You decent?

24:01.222 --> 24:02.441
[music continues]

24:10.536 --> 24:11.580
Lisbon?

24:11.667 --> 24:12.842
[groans]

24:30.469 --> 24:32.862
It's okay.

24:32.949 --> 24:34.864
I want you to just let me
try and help you

24:34.951 --> 24:36.823
get out of that thing.

24:36.910 --> 24:38.694
It's gonna be okay.

24:38.781 --> 24:39.695
Alright?

24:40.827 --> 24:41.784
Talk me through it.

24:43.351 --> 24:44.787
Um..

24:44.874 --> 24:46.963
you see the flap
in the front of the vest?

24:47.050 --> 24:49.488
- This here?
- Yeah. O-open it gently.

24:53.361 --> 24:54.623
Slowly.

24:59.323 --> 25:01.325
Okay. Um..

25:01.412 --> 25:02.588
Is there a lock inside?

25:03.806 --> 25:04.720
Yes.

25:06.417 --> 25:10.291
Uh, does the lock have any wires
attached to it, or..

25:14.121 --> 25:16.515
There's a bunch.
That's not good, is it?

25:17.820 --> 25:19.692
Don't pick the lock.

25:19.779 --> 25:22.433
No, I won't.
Where does this wire go?

25:22.521 --> 25:24.566
[cellphone ringing]

25:24.653 --> 25:27.003
Did you do that?

25:27.090 --> 25:29.005
I-I-I swear,
I didn't do anything.

25:29.092 --> 25:30.137
I didn't touch a thing.

25:32.400 --> 25:34.837
It's a phone.
You should answer it.

25:35.751 --> 25:37.274
You sure?

25:37.361 --> 25:38.928
About 75%.

25:41.496 --> 25:43.629
You-you think we should answer?

25:43.716 --> 25:45.108
Yeah.

25:45.195 --> 25:46.719
Wh-what if.. What if it
triggers the bomb?

25:46.806 --> 25:48.677
[ringing continues]

25:50.244 --> 25:51.462
We'll never know.

25:52.725 --> 25:54.596
[ringing continues]

26:00.167 --> 26:02.517
- Hello?
- 'Hello, Agent Lisbon.'

26:02.604 --> 26:05.433
[male #3]
'You must do exactly as I say
if you want to live.'

26:05.520 --> 26:06.913
Who is this?

26:07.000 --> 26:09.045
'You will go to the CBI now.'

26:11.613 --> 26:13.397
- Why?
- 'No questions please.'

26:13.484 --> 26:16.487
'You will obtain
the two Cash in Motion disks'

26:16.575 --> 26:19.621
'from the CBI evidence storage
and bring them to me.'

26:19.708 --> 26:22.537
'After delivery, I will give you
the instructions'

26:22.624 --> 26:24.147
'on how to disarm the bomb.'

26:24.234 --> 26:26.585
- You have 30 minutes.
- No. I-I'm not--

26:26.672 --> 26:28.325
Not no. Yes, yes.

26:28.412 --> 26:29.457
'Who's that with you?'

26:32.634 --> 26:35.550
Patrick Jane.
I-I work with Agent Lisbon. Hi.

26:35.637 --> 26:38.335
'Hello, Patrick.'

26:38.422 --> 26:40.686
'You're welcome to join us
if you'd like.'

26:40.773 --> 26:42.513
Well, I gotta tell you,
there's other--

26:42.601 --> 26:44.864
'In fact, I insist on it.'

26:44.951 --> 26:47.170
'You'll be of useful help
to Agent Lisbon.'

26:47.257 --> 26:49.390
What do we call you?

26:49.477 --> 26:51.522
'No questions, please.'

26:51.610 --> 26:53.568
'And two other ground rules.'

26:53.655 --> 26:56.963
Number one, do not alert
anyone to your situation.

26:58.268 --> 26:59.618
No one.

26:59.705 --> 27:02.838
If you do,
I will detonate the device.

27:02.925 --> 27:06.494
Number two, keep this line open.

27:06.581 --> 27:09.845
If I lose phone contact with you
for any reason at all

27:09.932 --> 27:12.761
I will detonate the device.

27:12.848 --> 27:15.155
Now get a move on.
You don't have very much time.

27:15.242 --> 27:16.765
- No, I'm not gonna do it--
- Don't listen to her.

27:16.852 --> 27:17.940
She can't think straight.

27:18.027 --> 27:19.420
We'll do exactly
what you asked for.

27:19.507 --> 27:21.030
We're on our way
to the CBI right now.

27:21.814 --> 27:24.338
[no audio]

27:24.425 --> 27:26.470
Okay. Let's go, Lisbon.
We don't have time.

27:35.566 --> 27:38.134
Hail Mary, full of grace
the Lord is with thee.

27:38.221 --> 27:40.136
Blessed art thou among women
and blessed is the fruit

27:40.223 --> 27:41.572
'of thy womb, Jesus.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.313
'Holy Mary, Mother of God'

27:43.400 --> 27:47.056
pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of death. Amen.

27:47.143 --> 27:48.449
You're whispering.

27:48.536 --> 27:49.755
Stop it.

27:49.842 --> 27:51.626
[Patrick]
'She's just praying.'

27:51.713 --> 27:53.062
She's scared, and so am I.

27:53.149 --> 27:54.411
'If I could find someone
to pray to'

27:54.498 --> 27:57.153
'then I'd probably do
the same.'

27:57.240 --> 27:58.677
'Well, it's irritating.'

27:58.764 --> 28:00.113
Be quiet.

28:00.200 --> 28:02.158
[Patrick]
'You're not a religious man?'

28:02.245 --> 28:03.203
Oh.

28:04.421 --> 28:05.422
Deeply.

28:07.729 --> 28:10.166
But not in any way
that you would understand.

28:10.253 --> 28:12.516
Well, try me.

28:12.603 --> 28:15.302
I do like
a good theological debate.

28:15.389 --> 28:17.565
'I would enjoy that.'

28:17.652 --> 28:20.133
But some other time, perhaps.

28:20.220 --> 28:23.266
Jane, the CBI building
is filled with people.

28:23.353 --> 28:24.615
This isn't right.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.182
We're putting
them in harm's way.

28:26.269 --> 28:27.531
He doesn't wanna
blow up the CBI.

28:27.618 --> 28:28.837
He just wants the disk.

28:28.924 --> 28:30.752
You just want
the disks, right?

28:30.839 --> 28:33.712
There's no call
to blow us up for fun.

28:33.799 --> 28:35.365
'Correct.'

28:35.452 --> 28:37.411
Dinkler was unlucky enough
to run into the police.

28:37.498 --> 28:39.761
That's the only reason he died.

28:39.848 --> 28:44.461
I am a rational
and humane person.

28:44.548 --> 28:47.943
'Obey me,
and you will live.'

28:48.030 --> 28:50.206
How far away are you?

28:52.339 --> 28:55.037
'I said how far away are you?'

28:55.124 --> 28:57.431
[Patrick]
'Uh, yeah, about five minutes.'

28:57.518 --> 28:58.867
Just, uh,
around the corner.

28:58.954 --> 29:00.260
'Good.'

29:00.347 --> 29:02.523
'You see how simple
this could be?'

29:02.610 --> 29:08.007
You just go through those doors,
up the stairs and get the disks.

29:08.094 --> 29:10.009
[Patrick]
'You know, when we get inside,
it gets a little tricky.'

29:10.096 --> 29:13.142
Because, uh, the evidence,
uh, storage unit

29:14.448 --> 29:16.232
is locked this time of night.

29:16.319 --> 29:18.931
Uh, so we're gonna have to
try and sneak in or..

29:23.196 --> 29:26.068
...ormake a whole fuss
getting it opened.

29:26.155 --> 29:28.201
'So sneak in.'

29:28.288 --> 29:29.637
Do whatever you have to do

29:29.724 --> 29:31.726
but if I get even
the faintest suspicion

29:31.813 --> 29:33.554
that you are
playing games with me

29:33.641 --> 29:35.948
I will detonate the device.

29:36.035 --> 29:37.471
'Do you understand?'

29:37.558 --> 29:38.472
[Patrick]
'Yes, sir.'

29:42.563 --> 29:46.306
Agent Lisbon,
did you understand also?

29:47.220 --> 29:48.351
Yes, sir.

29:51.267 --> 29:53.704
When we get the disks,
where do we go?

29:53.792 --> 29:56.229
[male #3]
Get them first,
and then I'll tell you.

30:00.059 --> 30:01.843
[Patrick]
'Okay, sir, we are at CBI.'

30:04.280 --> 30:08.719
We're on the third floor,
approaching the evidence storage

30:08.807 --> 30:10.504
'at the end of the hall.'

30:10.591 --> 30:12.506
'Which door is it?'

30:12.593 --> 30:14.682
[Teresa]
'That one over there.'

30:14.769 --> 30:16.249
[Patrick]
'Here.'

30:16.336 --> 30:17.293
Okay.

30:20.470 --> 30:21.645
It's locked.

30:23.038 --> 30:24.344
Can you open it?

30:24.431 --> 30:26.302
I think so.
Sure it's the right door?

30:26.389 --> 30:27.913
I'm pretty sure.

30:36.269 --> 30:37.531
Lisbon?

30:37.618 --> 30:38.575
Yeah?

30:41.100 --> 30:43.929
[Patrick]
'Listen, uh..'

30:44.016 --> 30:46.322
...if this doesn't
turn out well, um..

30:46.409 --> 30:48.803
'I-I just.. Well, there's been
something I've been wanting'

30:48.890 --> 30:52.111
'to tell you for a long time.'

30:52.198 --> 30:54.722
You know, the moment just
hasn't presented itself, and--

30:54.809 --> 30:57.072
[Teresa]
'Wait. Now?'

30:57.159 --> 30:58.465
'Are you sure this is
really the best time?'

30:58.552 --> 31:01.990
[Patrick]
'Well, if not now, then when?'

31:03.862 --> 31:05.254
[door opens]

31:05.341 --> 31:06.342
Disarm the bomb.

31:12.218 --> 31:15.351
[American accent]
I press this trigger, you die.

31:15.438 --> 31:16.396
So do you.

31:20.226 --> 31:22.315
You let me go.

31:22.402 --> 31:23.620
I let you live.

31:23.707 --> 31:27.059
No, you have two choices,
disarm the bomb

31:27.146 --> 31:28.408
or die here with us.

31:28.495 --> 31:31.933
With me. Jane, you go now.

31:32.020 --> 31:34.283
- Oh, I would if I could.
- Go!

31:34.370 --> 31:36.416
[Patrick]
'Look at me, sir.'

31:36.503 --> 31:38.331
I don't wanna die.

31:38.418 --> 31:39.767
I'm not afraid of death.

31:39.854 --> 31:41.725
I'm afraid of the pain
of dying

31:41.812 --> 31:43.510
because it's gonna hurt.

31:43.597 --> 31:46.730
You think it's gonna hurt?
You feel like dying?

31:46.817 --> 31:48.732
Jane, go! That's an order! Go!

31:48.819 --> 31:50.386
You're not the boss of me.
Look at me--

31:50.473 --> 31:52.606
Just once, listen to me,
you pigheaded, arrogant..

31:52.693 --> 31:54.825
Stay with me. Don't look at her.
Don't look at her. Stay with me.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.959
[Teresa]
'You've not listened to a thing
I've said all the..'

31:58.046 --> 31:59.918
[grunts]

32:02.050 --> 32:03.660
You listen to me.

32:03.747 --> 32:06.315
'You tell me right now
how to get this damn vest off'

32:06.402 --> 32:10.276
or god forgive me,
I will kill you.

32:10.363 --> 32:11.886
Yes, madam.

32:20.286 --> 32:22.375
The device is in the southeast
corner of the room.

32:22.462 --> 32:24.246
It's under the desk,
you won't miss it.

32:24.333 --> 32:28.381
Lisbon, Jane, well done.
Well done indeed.

32:28.468 --> 32:29.817
Has he given you anything?

32:29.904 --> 32:31.775
Not a thing.
Wouldn't give us his name.

32:31.862 --> 32:34.126
Wouldn't say why he wanted
the Cash in Motion client list

32:34.213 --> 32:36.041
so badly either.

32:36.128 --> 32:37.738
There's a reason
for everything I did.

32:38.695 --> 32:39.958
Let's go.

32:44.005 --> 32:46.529
Hey, you are not
off the hook.

32:46.616 --> 32:49.184
Off the hook? Oh, come on.
All's well that ends well.

32:49.271 --> 32:50.881
All is not well.

32:50.969 --> 32:53.188
Oh, please.

32:53.275 --> 32:54.494
[Teresa]
'Oh, don't give me a please.'

32:54.581 --> 32:56.583
'You just disobeyed
a direct order.'

32:56.670 --> 32:58.150
Don't sulk.

32:58.237 --> 33:01.283
I gave you an order.
It is my job to keep you alive.

33:01.370 --> 33:03.155
When I give you an order,
you follow it.

33:03.242 --> 33:05.113
- That's the deal.
- And I wanted to leave.

33:05.200 --> 33:06.810
I wanted to leave desperately

33:06.897 --> 33:09.074
but I would have looked
like a complete coward.

33:09.161 --> 33:11.380
It was my ego, my sheer vanity
that kept me there.

33:11.467 --> 33:12.512
Uh, that is not the point.
The point is..

33:12.599 --> 33:14.514
[gunfire]

33:17.778 --> 33:19.649
[indistinct radio chatter]

33:26.569 --> 33:27.831
He tried to escape.

33:27.918 --> 33:30.399
He went for a gun.

33:30.486 --> 33:31.574
I had no choice.

33:46.937 --> 33:48.852
[dramatic music]

34:10.960 --> 34:14.400
Well, you seem no worse
for wear, and I didn't think

34:14.487 --> 34:16.663
it would work out that way,
to be candid.

34:16.750 --> 34:17.967
Me neither.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.884
So...how the hell
did Jane know

34:20.971 --> 34:24.322
that it was
the gas station attendant?

34:24.409 --> 34:26.324
The code message
in the men's room.

34:26.411 --> 34:29.197
When Jane realized the bomber
could speak directly to Dinkler

34:29.284 --> 34:31.721
he knew there was no need
to leave Dinkler a message.

34:31.808 --> 34:34.681
The bomber could have just told
him where to go like he did me.

34:39.599 --> 34:41.731
[J.J.]
So the message
had to be a fake.

34:44.342 --> 34:46.606
And then everything
fell into place.

34:46.693 --> 34:48.956
If the message was fake,
then what was the real reason

34:49.043 --> 34:50.958
for Dinkler to stop
at the gas station?

34:54.527 --> 34:58.226
[Gale]
To deliver the customer
lists of course.

34:58.313 --> 35:00.228
Now that makes sense.

35:00.315 --> 35:02.317
Dinkler must have
been told to wait there

35:02.404 --> 35:04.406
and someone
would approach him.

35:04.493 --> 35:06.365
Dammit.

35:06.452 --> 35:08.106
Excuse me, sir!

35:08.193 --> 35:09.107
'You in the coat.'

35:13.850 --> 35:15.287
[J.J.]
But it all went wrong

35:15.374 --> 35:18.333
when the Sac PD
tumbled to Dinkler.

35:18.420 --> 35:20.205
So he had to be killed.

35:24.470 --> 35:26.863
And the lists wound up
in evidence.

35:26.950 --> 35:29.866
So the attendant set up a trap

35:29.953 --> 35:32.565
leaving a simple code
for the CBI to find

35:32.652 --> 35:35.002
knowing that he could
snag a CBI agent

35:35.089 --> 35:37.526
to retrieve the list for him.

35:37.613 --> 35:40.486
Well, it's risky,
but it's quite elegant, really.

35:42.792 --> 35:45.317
What was so important
about those client lists?

35:45.404 --> 35:46.970
Uh, we're still trying
to find that out.

35:47.057 --> 35:48.972
We're going through
every customer name on the list

35:49.059 --> 35:50.322
but there's a lot of 'em.

35:50.409 --> 35:52.585
Oh, well, never mind.

35:52.672 --> 35:56.850
With the culprit dead,
the case is as good as closed.

35:56.937 --> 35:59.766
- Job well done, both of you.
- Thank you.

35:59.853 --> 36:01.115
Thank you, people.

36:01.202 --> 36:03.117
[indistinct chattering]

36:10.733 --> 36:12.082
- Hey.
- Hi.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.259
I'm so glad you're okay.

36:14.346 --> 36:15.912
Thank you.

36:15.999 --> 36:17.740
And look, I know it's
the last thing on your mind

36:17.827 --> 36:20.352
so I thought I'd help out
and pick up your dress for you.

36:20.439 --> 36:22.441
So thoughtful. Thanks.

36:22.528 --> 36:23.703
- I left it in your office.
- Okay.

36:23.790 --> 36:25.095
Make sure it fits.

36:32.799 --> 36:33.887
Lisbon, any word
on that list yet?

36:33.974 --> 36:35.715
Jeez, Jane!
You mind knocking?

36:37.412 --> 36:38.370
Whoa.

36:40.763 --> 36:43.201
Oh, my.

36:43.288 --> 36:45.203
Van Pelt must die.

36:45.290 --> 36:46.726
No, no, no, no.
You look good.

36:46.813 --> 36:48.684
This is..

36:48.771 --> 36:51.426
...beautiful, like a princess,
an angry little princess.

36:51.513 --> 36:53.298
Someone stole your tiara.

36:53.385 --> 36:55.125
She caught me by surprise
when she asked me.

36:55.213 --> 36:57.171
Otherwise, I'd never agree
to be a bridesmaid.

36:57.258 --> 36:59.304
And why would she even ask me
to do something like this?

36:59.391 --> 37:00.566
She knows I hate this crap.

37:00.653 --> 37:02.307
I told her to ask you.

37:02.394 --> 37:03.351
I told her that you were
secretly dying

37:03.438 --> 37:04.396
to be a bridesmaid.

37:04.483 --> 37:06.354
Really? Why would you do that?

37:06.441 --> 37:08.356
Oh, for the fun of it,
and because, uh, of course

37:08.443 --> 37:10.402
deep down, you secretly
dowanna be a bridesmaid.

37:10.489 --> 37:11.968
Go ahead. Confess.

37:12.055 --> 37:14.144
Customer lists
from the Cash in Motion CDs.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.972
One name on there is Max James.

37:16.059 --> 37:17.800
The Sac PD homicide got
an anonymous call

37:17.887 --> 37:19.106
a few hours back.

37:19.193 --> 37:20.629
Dead man in a house on Cosgrove.

37:20.716 --> 37:22.762
Turns out
it's the same Max James.

37:22.849 --> 37:24.111
You might wanna change first.

37:24.198 --> 37:25.330
Hmm.

37:25.417 --> 37:26.635
Max James.

37:29.377 --> 37:30.291
Looks good.

37:31.814 --> 37:32.728
Very feminine.

37:40.475 --> 37:42.303
Max James, age 59.

37:42.390 --> 37:44.827
Coroner thinks he's been dead
at least four days.

37:44.914 --> 37:47.700
So he was dead before Gupta
put the bomb on Dinkler.

37:47.787 --> 37:49.179
[Kimball]
'And Gupta did this one too.'

37:49.267 --> 37:50.529
The bullet wound in the knee,
same caliber

37:50.616 --> 37:51.704
'as Dinkler's roommate.'

37:51.791 --> 37:53.967
Ah, but look at the ear
and the eye.

37:54.054 --> 37:56.186
'It's a completely
different MO.'

37:56.274 --> 37:58.537
Because the purpose
is different.

37:58.624 --> 38:00.321
This was torture.

38:00.408 --> 38:02.845
Gupta wanted
something from him.

38:02.932 --> 38:04.238
[Kimball]
'Well, James didn't die
from these injuries.'

38:04.325 --> 38:05.370
'Coroner thinks
he had a heart attack.'

38:05.457 --> 38:06.762
There you go, he expired

38:06.849 --> 38:08.286
before the killer got
what he wanted.

38:11.811 --> 38:14.901
A Cash in Motion receipt.

38:14.988 --> 38:17.033
This is what led him
to Dinkler.

38:17.120 --> 38:19.993
Gupta came here,
wanted information from James

38:20.080 --> 38:22.561
tortured him, but then
James ended up dying.

38:22.648 --> 38:25.738
He found this receipt,
and decided that he'd go

38:25.825 --> 38:27.827
'and get the information
some other way.'

38:27.914 --> 38:29.307
But all the lists had
were client names

38:29.394 --> 38:31.526
and cities
where they sent money.

38:31.613 --> 38:33.572
And Gupta already had
James' name.

38:33.659 --> 38:35.269
'So what the hell did
the lists get him?'

38:35.356 --> 38:37.184
[Patrick]
Yes, that is the question.

38:40.405 --> 38:42.711
Huh, this is weird.
Madeleine Hightower.

38:42.798 --> 38:44.060
What?

38:47.063 --> 38:48.761
That's Hightower.

38:49.675 --> 38:50.937
'With Max James.'

38:53.069 --> 38:54.680
Oh, crap.

38:54.767 --> 38:55.724
I'll call LaRoche.

38:55.811 --> 38:57.509
No, no, no, don't.

38:57.596 --> 38:59.249
Why not? It's his case.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.948
We gotta get
outta here now.

39:02.035 --> 39:05.430
Fix it with Sac PD,
we were never here.

39:05.517 --> 39:07.736
What's he talking about?

39:07.823 --> 39:09.521
I can't tell you
what's going on

39:09.608 --> 39:11.784
but you need to
keep this quiet.

39:11.871 --> 39:13.307
Hightower's a fugitive.
She killed two people.

39:13.394 --> 39:15.483
She nearly killed Jane.
What can't you tell me?

39:15.570 --> 39:19.095
Cho, this is an order.
We are gonna walk away.

39:19.182 --> 39:21.097
Sac PD is gonna
handle this case.

39:21.184 --> 39:22.577
Boss..

39:22.664 --> 39:26.233
Kimball, I need you
to trust me, please.

39:26.320 --> 39:28.670
When I can tell you
what's going on, I will.

39:28.757 --> 39:30.324
Until then, it's better
you don't know.

39:30.411 --> 39:31.369
It's for your own good.

39:35.024 --> 39:38.811
Red John's behind the bombs.
He's hunting Hightower.

39:38.898 --> 39:41.074
Yeah.

39:41.161 --> 39:44.077
Max James was a friend
of hers, or a relative.

39:44.164 --> 39:45.644
He must have known
where she is.

39:45.731 --> 39:47.341
- We have to warn her.
- How?

39:47.428 --> 39:49.125
I don't know where she is.

39:49.212 --> 39:52.085
If Red John failed, what do you
think he's gonna do next?

39:52.172 --> 39:54.522
- I have to think about that.
- He could come after you, Jane.

39:54.609 --> 39:56.655
Why?

39:56.742 --> 39:59.745
I truly don't know
where Hightower is right now.

39:59.832 --> 40:01.137
If I don't
totally believe you

40:01.224 --> 40:02.748
Red John probably
doesn't either.

40:02.835 --> 40:05.533
If Red john wants me,
he knows where to find me.

40:05.620 --> 40:07.056
I can't worry about that.

40:23.246 --> 40:25.074
[dramatic music]

40:52.972 --> 40:54.843
[music continues]

41:08.727 --> 41:09.902
[sighs]

41:11.860 --> 41:13.732
[water dripping]

41:28.224 --> 41:29.704
Hello.

41:30.836 --> 41:31.924
Hello, Patrick.

41:34.666 --> 41:37.320
We need to talk.

41:37.407 --> 41:38.365
Hightower.

41:51.596 --> 41:53.162
Are you alone?

41:53.249 --> 41:55.774
Yes, just me and my demons,
and they're not gonna hurt you

41:55.861 --> 41:59.734
so please, Madeleine,
could you put the gun down?

41:59.821 --> 42:02.476
You people and your guns.

42:06.175 --> 42:07.133
Thank you.

42:08.743 --> 42:09.875
Would you like some tea?

42:12.225 --> 42:13.313
Yes.

42:14.401 --> 42:15.489
Civilized.

42:17.839 --> 42:20.189
So this is where you live.

42:20.276 --> 42:21.234
Sometimes.

42:23.541 --> 42:25.847
Oh, it's nice.

42:25.934 --> 42:28.676
Could use
a few personal touches.

42:28.763 --> 42:33.246
I gather you're not here to give
me decoration tips, are you?

42:33.333 --> 42:36.249
Your murder victim today..

42:36.336 --> 42:38.120
- Max James.
- 'Hmm.'

42:38.207 --> 42:40.470
He was my cousin.

42:40.558 --> 42:44.083
He had been helping me out,
sending me money.

42:44.170 --> 42:45.388
When he stopped
picking up the phone

42:45.475 --> 42:46.912
I went to go check on him.

42:46.999 --> 42:48.435
I'm sorry.

42:48.522 --> 42:50.306
'Yeah.'

42:50.393 --> 42:53.005
I saw what
they did to him.

42:53.092 --> 42:54.702
They tortured him
a good, long while

42:54.789 --> 42:56.748
before they killed him.

42:56.835 --> 42:59.577
Must have been asking him
where me and the kids were.

43:01.579 --> 43:02.580
And he knew.

43:04.843 --> 43:07.062
He knew.
But he didn't tell.

43:09.151 --> 43:10.370
A good man.

43:10.457 --> 43:11.414
He was.

43:14.504 --> 43:16.594
Red John is getting closer.

43:16.681 --> 43:19.553
He's gonna find me,
eventually.

43:19.640 --> 43:21.555
- 'I know it.'
- Not necessarily.

43:21.642 --> 43:23.165
I've had it, Jane.

43:24.776 --> 43:25.951
I'm turning myself in.

43:26.038 --> 43:28.606
I just wanted you
to know first.

43:28.693 --> 43:30.259
Okay.

43:30.346 --> 43:33.480
I'll prove I'm innocent
of Todd Johnson's murder.

43:33.567 --> 43:35.743
Prove it in court.

43:35.830 --> 43:39.791
At least I'll know my kids will
be properly taken care of, safe.

43:39.878 --> 43:43.055
'It's no life for kids,
no life at all.'

43:43.142 --> 43:45.187
'We've had enough running.'

43:45.274 --> 43:47.320
'Please don't try to make me
change my mind.'

43:47.407 --> 43:49.061
I-I understand. No.

43:51.629 --> 43:52.630
Jane, I'm sorry, I..

43:55.458 --> 43:57.417
I know this messes
things up, your plan

43:57.504 --> 44:00.463
but it's.. It's not like you're
getting anywhere, are you?

44:00.550 --> 44:02.204
I mean, are you
any closer to finding out

44:02.291 --> 44:04.467
who Red John's accomplice
is in the CBI?

44:04.554 --> 44:07.819
Yes. Uh, well, I..
It's complicated.

44:07.906 --> 44:09.864
'I've been trying to work'

44:09.951 --> 44:13.607
very slowly and carefully,
but this..

44:13.694 --> 44:16.741
This, uh, changes things.

44:16.828 --> 44:18.481
- I've got to do this.
- 'No, I understand.'

44:18.568 --> 44:20.701
'It's the right thing to do.'

44:20.788 --> 44:23.835
Please, just give me 48 hours
before you surrender.

44:23.922 --> 44:26.054
Lisbon and the team
will protect you and your kids

44:26.141 --> 44:29.057
and I will find
Red John's friend.

44:29.144 --> 44:30.798
How will you do in 48 hours

44:30.885 --> 44:32.539
what you haven't been able
to do in months?

44:35.281 --> 44:37.196
I will because I have to.

44:42.418 --> 44:43.681
- Follow me.
- What's up?

44:43.768 --> 44:44.986
Uh, we have a situation.

44:48.860 --> 44:51.427
Guys, O'Malley's half an hour.

44:51.514 --> 44:55.040
Rigsby, O'Malley's
half an hour.

44:55.127 --> 44:57.085
What kind of situation?

44:57.172 --> 44:58.957
Hightower situation.

45:03.526 --> 45:05.572
When I was held
captive by Red John

45:05.659 --> 45:08.531
I-I told you that he
didn't say anything to me.

45:08.618 --> 45:12.231
Um...that was a lie.

45:13.449 --> 45:15.669
He recited a poem.

45:15.756 --> 45:19.194
"Tiger tiger burning bright,
in the forests of the night

45:19.281 --> 45:20.761
[together]
"What immortal hand or eye..

45:20.848 --> 45:23.155
"Could frame
thy fearful symmetry?

45:23.242 --> 45:25.244
"In what distant deeps or skies

45:25.331 --> 45:27.899
"burnt the fire of thine eyes."

45:27.986 --> 45:29.770
- That's William Blake.
- What does it mean?

45:29.857 --> 45:32.207
Well, God made the lamb..

45:32.294 --> 45:34.949
...but he also made the tiger.

45:35.036 --> 45:37.691
You can't have light without
darkness, life without death.

45:37.778 --> 45:39.301
Here's the thing.

45:39.388 --> 45:42.478
Before he died, Todd Johnson

45:42.565 --> 45:46.221
recited the first two words
of that exact same poem.

45:46.308 --> 45:48.963
- "Tiger tiger."
- Oh.

45:49.050 --> 45:51.357
He knew about Red John.
He was gonna talk.

45:51.444 --> 45:54.012
Red John had him killed
to stop him talking.

45:54.099 --> 45:56.231
But he was killed
by Agent Hightower.

45:56.318 --> 45:58.973
- She's with Red John?
- She didn't do it.

45:59.060 --> 46:01.976
She was framed to conceal
the identity of the real killer.

46:02.063 --> 46:04.849
Someone else inside the CBI
is working for Red John.

46:04.936 --> 46:06.198
Hightower wants to surrender.

46:06.285 --> 46:08.374
She wants to prove
her innocence in court.

46:08.461 --> 46:10.506
She wants her kids to be safe.

46:10.593 --> 46:12.334
I asked her to give us 48 hours

46:12.421 --> 46:14.336
before she turns herself
into the authorities

46:14.423 --> 46:17.644
'and you guys will protect her
in the meantime.'

46:17.731 --> 46:18.906
Wearethe authorities.

46:18.993 --> 46:21.126
Yes, well, you know,
you're not the man.

46:21.213 --> 46:24.999
Yeah, we are.
We can't look after her.

46:25.086 --> 46:27.219
If we see Hightower,
we're supposed to arrest her.

46:27.306 --> 46:29.656
So arrest her.
Just don't tell anybody.

46:29.743 --> 46:31.266
She gave you
48 hours to do what?

46:31.353 --> 46:33.616
48 hours to find
Red John's friend

46:33.703 --> 46:36.402
and have that friend
lead us to Red John.

46:36.489 --> 46:37.969
And how will you do that?

46:38.056 --> 46:40.885
LaRoche had a list
with Hightower's name on it

46:40.972 --> 46:43.061
and four other suspects
who were in the building

46:43.148 --> 46:44.627
'at the time of the murder.'

46:44.714 --> 46:47.065
And who are
the four other suspects?

46:47.152 --> 46:49.241
- I don't know.
- Did you ask LaRoche?

46:49.328 --> 46:52.026
No. I didn't.

46:52.113 --> 46:53.767
'Because if one
of LaRoche's suspects'

46:53.854 --> 46:55.073
'isn't Red John's friend'

46:55.160 --> 46:57.292
then LaRoche is
Red John's friend.

46:57.379 --> 46:59.207
And if I ask him
about the suspects

46:59.294 --> 47:01.775
then he'll know
that I know, and I will lose

47:01.862 --> 47:03.951
the one advantage
I had over Red John.

47:04.038 --> 47:06.084
So first you have to get
the list off LaRoche.

47:06.171 --> 47:07.912
Who doesn't like
to tell you the time.

47:07.999 --> 47:09.609
And then you have to figure out
which one of the suspects

47:09.696 --> 47:12.438
is Red John's friend
if it's not LaRoche himself.

47:12.525 --> 47:15.006
- In 48 hours.
- Don't worry.

47:15.093 --> 47:18.009
I have a brilliant plan
which requires your help

47:18.096 --> 47:21.534
but we must act...now.

47:21.621 --> 47:23.275
- Oh.
- I know.

47:23.362 --> 47:25.146
I know, this scares me too.

47:25.233 --> 47:28.236
I'm gonna do this, but if any
of you do not wanna take part

47:28.323 --> 47:31.196
that is totally okay.

47:33.285 --> 47:35.200
- I'm in.
- Yep.

47:35.287 --> 47:36.549
Me too.

47:37.506 --> 47:38.899
Thank you.

47:41.554 --> 47:45.427
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, you can.

47:45.514 --> 47:46.864
[instrumental music]

47:53.087 --> 47:54.001
[sighs]

48:02.880 --> 48:04.272
Yes?

48:04.359 --> 48:06.231
I need the names
of the four other suspects

48:06.318 --> 48:08.798
you identified
in the Todd Johnson murder.

48:08.886 --> 48:10.713
Why?

48:10.800 --> 48:14.500
Madeleine Hightower
contacted me.

48:14.587 --> 48:17.851
She says she's innocent.
I believe her.

48:17.938 --> 48:20.114
Which means
one of those four people

48:20.201 --> 48:21.376
is the real culprit.

48:21.463 --> 48:22.987
Where is Hightower?

48:23.074 --> 48:25.511
Oh, you don't need to know.

48:25.598 --> 48:26.947
She's gonna
turn herself in soon

48:27.034 --> 48:28.253
fight her case in court.

48:28.340 --> 48:29.950
Why is this your business?

48:30.037 --> 48:32.344
If the case is reopened,
I will investigate

48:32.431 --> 48:34.694
any other suspects
if necessary.

48:34.781 --> 48:36.609
You know me.

48:36.696 --> 48:39.525
I'm inquisitive, nosy.

48:39.612 --> 48:41.788
The answer is no.

48:41.875 --> 48:44.356
You cannot have the names
of the other suspects.

48:44.443 --> 48:45.792
Why not?

48:45.879 --> 48:48.273
Policy, rules.

48:48.360 --> 48:51.929
Well, that's a shame.

48:52.016 --> 48:55.062
How about I make sure Hightower
surrenders to you personally?

48:55.149 --> 48:56.803
I'll tell you
where she's hiding out.

48:56.890 --> 48:59.545
You should do that anyway.

48:59.632 --> 49:01.634
It's your duty as a citizen.

49:01.721 --> 49:03.505
[chuckles]

49:04.898 --> 49:07.161
I love you.

49:07.248 --> 49:08.728
I'll tell you what.

49:08.815 --> 49:10.469
You give me the list

49:10.556 --> 49:13.124
and I will tell you
where Hightower is.

49:13.211 --> 49:16.649
And as an added bonus..

49:18.564 --> 49:22.829
...I promise I will keep
your secret entirely to myself.

49:24.526 --> 49:25.963
My secret?

49:26.050 --> 49:28.313
Yeah, let me jog your memory.

49:28.400 --> 49:30.141
Donald Culpepper.

49:30.228 --> 49:31.142
'Remember him?'

49:31.229 --> 49:33.057
Burglarized your house.

49:33.144 --> 49:34.493
Yes.

49:34.580 --> 49:38.323
He was looking
for the list. My guy.

49:38.410 --> 49:40.847
You're admitting
to a serious criminal offense.

49:40.934 --> 49:43.067
I could arrest you
right now.

49:43.154 --> 49:45.112
Yeah, you could.

49:45.199 --> 49:46.984
But you won't.

49:48.420 --> 49:50.639
Culpepper didn't come up
with the list.

49:50.726 --> 49:55.253
But he certainly searched
your house very thoroughly.

49:55.340 --> 49:58.038
Opened the safe..

49:58.125 --> 50:01.911
...looked inside that Tupperware
box you keep in there.

50:04.001 --> 50:05.524
Interesting.

50:07.613 --> 50:09.919
That's private.

50:10.007 --> 50:13.575
You're not kidding.
It should be.

50:13.662 --> 50:15.969
I'd love to help you
try and keep it that way.

50:19.103 --> 50:20.408
[instrumental music]

50:31.680 --> 50:34.727
You're a fascinating man,
Patrick.

50:34.814 --> 50:38.122
Who knows what you might have
achieved in this world

50:38.209 --> 50:40.385
were you not quite
so damaged.

50:48.262 --> 50:50.351
You were going to tell me
where Hightower is.

50:50.438 --> 50:52.701
Oh, I'll tell you,
but listen, uh

50:52.788 --> 50:54.877
it's important to let her be
until she's ready to come in.

50:54.964 --> 50:57.315
She needs to make arrangements
with her kids.

50:57.402 --> 50:59.447
- Give her two days.
- Alright.

51:07.586 --> 51:08.935
[dramatic music]

51:20.294 --> 51:22.818
So I have here in my hand

51:22.905 --> 51:24.777
LaRoche's four suspects.

51:24.864 --> 51:26.692
How did you get him to tell?

51:26.779 --> 51:29.129
I threatened to reveal
his dark secret.

51:29.216 --> 51:31.175
- Which is what?
- I have no idea.

51:31.262 --> 51:34.830
I was bluffing. But it
must be something horrible.

51:36.658 --> 51:38.312
Who are the suspects?

51:46.320 --> 51:48.801
Brenda Shettrick,
CBI media relations.

51:50.324 --> 51:53.197
Assistant DA,
Osvaldo Ardiles.

51:53.284 --> 51:55.112
Gale Bertram,
bureau director

51:56.374 --> 51:58.550
and Craig O'Laughlin.

51:58.637 --> 52:00.813
Craig?
Craig is on the list?

52:00.900 --> 52:03.294
- That's ridiculous!
- 'No doubt, no doubt.'

52:03.381 --> 52:04.860
Now there are three
innocent people on that list

52:04.947 --> 52:06.210
and only one bad guy.

52:06.297 --> 52:09.691
Or they're all innocent,
and it was LaRoche.

52:09.778 --> 52:11.519
LaRoche did kill
the gas station attendant

52:11.606 --> 52:12.738
maybe to keep him quiet.

52:12.825 --> 52:14.392
It's not Craig.

52:14.479 --> 52:17.264
- Well, you never know.
- Director Bertram?

52:17.351 --> 52:18.874
Brenda Shettrick? Ardiles?

52:18.961 --> 52:19.875
None of them look
like villains, do they?

52:19.962 --> 52:21.616
He's my fiance.

52:21.703 --> 52:24.793
Grace, while Craig's a suspect,
he's a suspect.

52:24.880 --> 52:26.230
Do you understand that?

52:26.317 --> 52:28.232
Meaning you can't talk
to him about any of this.

52:28.319 --> 52:31.104
[Teresa]
'It's probably best to avoid him
for a couple of days.'

52:31.191 --> 52:34.151
You go up to the mountains
and stand guard over Hightower.

52:34.238 --> 52:35.543
You can explain
everything to Craig

52:35.630 --> 52:38.111
once we've ID'd
Red John's accomplice.

52:38.198 --> 52:40.287
[Patrick]
'Grace, it's a good thing.'

52:40.374 --> 52:42.811
Little coolness keeps
a man on their toes.

52:42.898 --> 52:44.465
So how are we gonna work out
which one's guilty?

52:44.552 --> 52:45.988
Red John is out
to kill Hightower.

52:46.075 --> 52:47.033
Yeah.

52:47.120 --> 52:48.426
So we tell all the suspects

52:48.513 --> 52:49.949
where Hightower is.

52:50.036 --> 52:52.517
Ah, only she won't be there,
and we will

52:52.604 --> 52:53.822
and then one of the suspects
will come to kill her. Nice.

52:53.909 --> 52:55.302
- No.
- 'No?'

52:55.389 --> 52:56.695
No.

52:56.782 --> 52:58.392
Red John is
not gonna send in

52:58.479 --> 53:01.047
his inside man in CBI.

53:01.134 --> 53:02.657
That is a very valuable asset.

53:02.744 --> 53:05.007
He will send in
an anonymous assassin

53:05.094 --> 53:07.053
someone disposable.

53:07.140 --> 53:08.489
Well, then how are we gonna know

53:08.576 --> 53:10.317
which one of
the suspects told Red John?

53:10.404 --> 53:11.318
What?

53:14.974 --> 53:17.150
Okay. Here's how it works.

53:23.417 --> 53:26.638
Pacific Palms Hotel,
room 705.

53:26.725 --> 53:29.554
- Thank you.
- Give her two days, yes?

53:29.641 --> 53:30.946
That was our deal.

53:37.866 --> 53:41.435
- Hey, Brenda.
- Hey, Teresa. What's up?

53:41.522 --> 53:42.784
Like you asked for,
ideas from the unit

53:42.871 --> 53:44.395
for the community
outreach program.

53:44.482 --> 53:47.267
Really? Oh, that's great.
That's very efficient of you.

53:47.354 --> 53:49.313
Most departments just
blew me off on that one.

53:49.400 --> 53:51.793
We aim to please.

53:51.880 --> 53:52.925
[instrumental music]

53:59.323 --> 54:03.022
'"Hightower,
Pacific Palms, room 405?"'

54:10.856 --> 54:12.379
[knock on door]

54:13.815 --> 54:15.904
Morning, agent.

54:15.991 --> 54:17.036
Speak.

54:18.820 --> 54:20.605
Heads up on
a situation, sir.

54:20.692 --> 54:22.737
Jane's in contact
with Madeleine Hightower.

54:22.824 --> 54:25.392
'He's trying to persuade her
to give herself up.'

54:25.479 --> 54:27.394
You think she'll do it?

54:27.481 --> 54:29.309
Yes, sir.

54:29.396 --> 54:31.485
[sighs]
Hell.

54:31.572 --> 54:34.401
That's what we need. That damn
situation back in the news.

54:34.488 --> 54:37.883
But she still insists that she's
innocent, that she was framed.

54:37.970 --> 54:41.365
Well, if that's true,
it's even worse.

54:41.452 --> 54:43.845
The thing is, sir,
we know where she's at.

54:43.932 --> 54:46.021
We could go in and get her,
but I would much rather have

54:46.108 --> 54:48.763
Jane bring her in peacefully
than to take her in by force.

54:48.850 --> 54:52.680
God forbid somebody get hurt.
I'd like to give Jane 48 hours.

54:52.767 --> 54:55.553
If that doesn't work,
we'll go in and arrest her.

54:55.640 --> 54:57.685
You sure you can
control the situation?

54:57.772 --> 54:59.687
Yes, sir.
We know her exact location.

54:59.774 --> 55:02.124
She's at the Pacific Palms
Hotel, room 605.

55:02.211 --> 55:04.126
If she leaves that building,
we're on her.

55:07.434 --> 55:08.783
Well, okay.

55:10.176 --> 55:12.744
It's your call.

55:12.831 --> 55:14.920
I wish Hightower
and this whole mess

55:15.007 --> 55:17.923
would just vanish, frankly.

55:18.010 --> 55:21.274
- 'What can you do?'
- Yes, sir.

55:28.150 --> 55:29.891
Gracias,Raquel.

55:29.978 --> 55:31.066
Hey, Ardiles.

55:33.025 --> 55:34.809
So did you find a good spot
for the package?

55:34.896 --> 55:36.463
You mean Hightower?

55:36.550 --> 55:37.551
[Kimball]
We agreed to
call her package.

55:37.638 --> 55:38.944
Oh, right. Yeah.

55:39.031 --> 55:41.294
She's at the, uh,
Pacific Palms Hotel.

55:41.381 --> 55:42.904
You know what's really weird?

55:42.991 --> 55:44.079
Pacific Palms
is the name of the street

55:44.166 --> 55:46.517
my mom lives on and Hightower

55:46.604 --> 55:49.911
I mean, the package
is in room 305

55:49.998 --> 55:53.175
which is my mom's house number.
305 Pacific Palms.

55:53.262 --> 55:54.394
- How weird is that?
- 'Ah, it's not very weird.'

55:54.481 --> 55:56.004
I thought it was really weird.

55:56.091 --> 55:58.311
I'll take a medium
non-fat latte, please.

55:58.398 --> 55:59.704
I'll have the same.

56:08.713 --> 56:10.758
Hey. You, uh, you seen Grace?

56:10.845 --> 56:12.238
She's not answering
her phone.

56:12.325 --> 56:16.155
Uh, no, she's kinda
super busy right now.

56:16.242 --> 56:18.157
Oh, yeah?
What's going on?

56:18.244 --> 56:19.376
Um..

56:22.901 --> 56:25.947
Hightower's surfaced.
Grace is guarding her.

56:26.034 --> 56:28.907
Hightower? Wow.
What's the deal?

56:28.994 --> 56:31.736
Well, it's, um..
It's kind of a long story.

56:31.823 --> 56:34.086
Yeah, I bet. So Grace will be
gone for a while I guess.

56:34.173 --> 56:37.350
- Yeah, she could be.
- Oh, that's too bad.

56:37.437 --> 56:39.047
Oh, what, you can't live
without her now?

56:39.134 --> 56:41.485
[chuckles]
Well, what can I say?

56:41.572 --> 56:43.095
I-I miss her when
she's not around.

56:43.182 --> 56:44.618
I'm man enough to admit it.

56:44.705 --> 56:48.709
Alright, well, so you
don't get too anxious

56:48.796 --> 56:50.407
and you didn't hear
this from me.

56:50.494 --> 56:52.452
But you might wanna check out

56:52.539 --> 56:55.760
the Pacific Palms Hotel,
room 505.

56:55.847 --> 56:58.937
Okay. Great. Thanks.
Appreciate it.

56:59.024 --> 57:00.721
But I'll probably
tough it out, you know?

57:00.808 --> 57:03.071
I don't wanna be too clingy.
Women hate that.

57:03.158 --> 57:04.682
Right.

57:04.769 --> 57:05.900
Alright, I'll see ya.

57:09.774 --> 57:12.080
Oh, thank God. There it is.
I gave you the wrong file.

57:12.167 --> 57:14.779
Yeah. There you go.

57:14.866 --> 57:16.302
You didn't
read this, did you?

57:16.389 --> 57:17.999
It's totally top secret.

57:18.086 --> 57:20.001
No, no, of course not.
I mean, no.

57:20.088 --> 57:22.003
[sighs]

57:22.090 --> 57:25.050
Listen, please don't
tell anybody I did this.

57:25.137 --> 57:26.573
I would feel like
such a fool.

57:26.660 --> 57:29.968
Uh.. My lips are sealed.
I swear.

57:30.055 --> 57:32.274
Thank you.

57:32.361 --> 57:34.494
Um, Teresa?

57:34.581 --> 57:36.583
What about
the community outreach?

57:36.670 --> 57:39.978
Oh! Yeah. I-I'm gonna
get back to you on that.

57:42.284 --> 57:43.590
[dramatic music]

57:48.290 --> 57:51.119
[Patrick]
Each individual suspect
was told that Hightower

57:51.206 --> 57:54.688
is at the Pacific Palms Hotel.

57:54.775 --> 57:57.822
But each was given
a different room number.

57:57.909 --> 57:59.954
So the room the killer goes to

58:00.041 --> 58:04.002
will tell us
which suspect told Red John.

[Kimball]
'Hey, Rigsby, move
the camera more to the right.'

58:18.973 --> 58:20.584
Yep. Okay.

58:24.979 --> 58:28.417
- Better?
- Good.

58:28.505 --> 58:29.854
There.

58:29.941 --> 58:33.466
[Patrick]
Simple, elegant, foolproof.

58:33.553 --> 58:36.251
[Teresa]
'Please don't say that.
Nothing is foolproof.'

58:38.732 --> 58:40.255
[Patrick]
'Who has a key
to the minibar?'

58:40.342 --> 58:42.475
I do, and I'm keeping it.
We're on the job.

58:42.562 --> 58:44.346
You're on the job.
I'm an amateur.

58:44.433 --> 58:46.914
Besides, all I want
is those expensive peanuts.

58:47.001 --> 58:47.959
Thank you.

58:51.484 --> 58:53.921
[cellphone ringing]

'Hey, boss.'

58:55.227 --> 58:56.837
[Teresa]
'Van Pelt, you alright?'

58:56.924 --> 58:59.797
Everyone's safe and sound.
All good here.

58:59.884 --> 59:03.757
- Did you talk to Craig?
- 'No, but I'm sure he's fine.'

59:03.844 --> 59:05.411
Look, I'll come and spell you
in a bit as soon as this thing

59:05.498 --> 59:06.717
'plays out here.'

59:06.804 --> 59:08.632
Thanks, boss.

59:08.719 --> 59:11.330
- Tell her I said hey.
- Madeleine says hey.

59:11.417 --> 59:13.114
Hi back.

59:13.201 --> 59:15.508
Oh, tell Hightower
she'll soon be exonerated.

59:15.595 --> 59:18.163
I already hung up,
and stop being so confident.

59:18.250 --> 59:20.034
It makes me nervous.

59:20.121 --> 59:21.470
[dramatic music]

59:40.359 --> 59:43.710
This is beginning to look like
a huge waste of time.

59:43.797 --> 59:48.280
Whenever you say that, success
is just around the corner.

59:51.544 --> 59:52.763
[music continues]

01:00:00.422 --> 01:00:01.902
[Patrick]
'There. Look.'

01:00:01.989 --> 01:00:03.600
The assassin's here.

01:00:11.695 --> 01:00:13.871
What, her? How can you tell?

01:00:13.958 --> 01:00:15.829
[Patrick]
'She's carrying a large bag
with very little in it'

01:00:15.916 --> 01:00:17.265
no jewelry,
and she has a killer's face.

01:00:17.352 --> 01:00:18.963
Come on.

01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:20.312
[Wayne]
'Yeah, she looks
kinda nice to me.'

01:00:20.399 --> 01:00:21.835
No. Homicidal eyes.
Clear as day.

01:00:24.838 --> 01:00:27.188
What's your bet, Jane?
Which room will she go to?

01:00:27.275 --> 01:00:29.277
[Patrick]
'It's a five horse race.
Fool's bet.'

01:00:29.364 --> 01:00:30.888
You, boss? Any guesses?

01:00:30.975 --> 01:00:33.847
For all we know,
she's a tourist from Iowa.

01:00:34.718 --> 01:00:36.633
[dramatic music]

01:00:51.038 --> 01:00:52.039
No.

01:00:52.126 --> 01:00:53.432
[Teresa]
'Eighth floor?'

01:00:53.519 --> 01:00:55.129
That's our floor.

01:01:00.004 --> 01:01:01.483
She just went by.

01:01:01.570 --> 01:01:02.789
Told ya. Tourist.

01:01:02.876 --> 01:01:05.836
No, she's taking
the fire stairs.

01:01:05.923 --> 01:01:07.968
[Teresa]
'Maybe.'

01:01:08.055 --> 01:01:09.970
[Patrick]
'Patience.'

01:01:10.057 --> 01:01:13.582
'She'll appear
any moment.'

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:15.802
[Teresa]
'Or she's just gotten
back from day of sightseeing'

01:01:15.889 --> 01:01:16.890
'and she wants
to get into a nice--'

01:01:16.977 --> 01:01:19.023
[Patrick]
'There!'

01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:21.721
'There she is.'

01:01:21.808 --> 01:01:23.854
[Teresa]
'Oh, my God.'

01:01:23.941 --> 01:01:25.551
- Bertram!
- Wow.

01:01:29.555 --> 01:01:32.210
Bertram. Red John's man
is the CBI director?

01:01:32.297 --> 01:01:33.211
'How messed up is that?'

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:42.699

01:02:10.335 --> 01:02:11.728
[dramatic music]

01:02:23.522 --> 01:02:25.219

01:02:25.306 --> 01:02:26.743
[beep]

01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:28.483
Don't move! Police!

01:02:28.570 --> 01:02:30.398
Ma'am, stay right where you are.
We're not gonna hurt you.

01:02:30.485 --> 01:02:32.531
Hands.
Put your hands in the air.

01:02:32.618 --> 01:02:33.575
No, thanks.

01:02:35.316 --> 01:02:36.274
Damn!

01:02:39.712 --> 01:02:40.844

01:02:47.851 --> 01:02:48.373

Knockout drugs, rope, bag.

01:03:14.965 --> 01:03:16.880
'Looks like she was trying
to take Hightower alive.'

01:03:16.967 --> 01:03:18.969
'Back to Red John.'

01:03:19.056 --> 01:03:22.799
Yeah. Maybe. Let's go.

01:03:22.886 --> 01:03:24.365
We've got a dead body out there.

01:03:24.452 --> 01:03:26.193
Call it in, if we're still
here when the hotel security

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:27.673
gets here, we're gonna
be here forever.

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:28.979
We got a lot to do.
We gotta keep moving.

01:03:29.066 --> 01:03:30.763
Wait. A lot of what to do?

01:03:30.850 --> 01:03:33.766
We have to find a good spot
for a trap to lure Bertram

01:03:33.853 --> 01:03:36.116
'a trap that Red John
will follow him into.'

01:03:36.203 --> 01:03:39.032
Oh, simple, then. You're getting
that crazy look in your eyes.

01:03:39.119 --> 01:03:41.643
- Calm down!
- Perfectly calm.

01:03:41.730 --> 01:03:43.994
'Red John is
one step behind me'

01:03:44.081 --> 01:03:45.822
'but he thinks
he's one step ahead'

01:03:45.909 --> 01:03:48.868
so in effect, he's two steps
behind, and he doesn't know it.

01:03:48.955 --> 01:03:51.566
He's gonna be overconfident
when he walks into my trap.

01:03:51.653 --> 01:03:53.786
And what will you use
as a lure for this trap?

01:03:53.873 --> 01:03:55.440
Can we move, please?

01:03:55.527 --> 01:03:57.964
Because I can answer
all your questions in motion.

01:03:58.051 --> 01:03:59.836
I'm clever like that.
Thank you.

01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:07.756
Hey! There you are.

01:04:07.844 --> 01:04:09.454
Hey, stranger.

01:04:09.541 --> 01:04:12.718
Okay, I'm sorry, but I have
a good explanation.

01:04:12.805 --> 01:04:15.155
Uh, Rigsby told me.
'Cause Hightower is back.

01:04:15.242 --> 01:04:16.853
But I don't see why that means
you can't answer your phone.

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:18.811
I know, it's a long story.

01:04:18.898 --> 01:04:20.552
But I've been
guarding Hightower

01:04:20.639 --> 01:04:23.990
who is totally innocent,
but whoever killed Todd Johnson

01:04:24.077 --> 01:04:26.210
is working with Red John.

01:04:26.297 --> 01:04:27.385
Wow.

01:04:27.472 --> 01:04:30.083
And...you were a suspect.

01:04:31.519 --> 01:04:33.913
Me? You're kidding.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.741
I know, right?

01:04:35.828 --> 01:04:39.136
But we found who's the real
killer, so...you're cleared.

01:04:39.223 --> 01:04:41.007
Oh, glad to hear.

01:04:41.094 --> 01:04:43.575
So who is it?
Who's the real killer?

01:04:43.662 --> 01:04:46.056
When I tell you,
you'll freak out.

01:04:46.143 --> 01:04:48.493
But right now I have
to go relieve Lisbon

01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:51.235
from guarding Hightower.

01:04:51.322 --> 01:04:54.847
Hey, will you come
with me? It's a drive.

01:04:54.934 --> 01:04:57.676
I don't know. This all sounds
kinda sketchy, so..

01:04:57.763 --> 01:05:01.288
It is kinda sketchy.
Please?

01:05:03.377 --> 01:05:05.640
Of course.
I'll go with you.

01:05:05.727 --> 01:05:06.685
Thank you.

01:05:11.298 --> 01:05:13.561
- 'Jane?'
- Yes?

01:05:15.302 --> 01:05:18.697
Yes? I-I'm kind
of in a hurry here.

01:05:18.784 --> 01:05:20.742
Oh, I can imagine.

01:05:20.829 --> 01:05:22.701
Busy boy.

01:05:22.788 --> 01:05:25.225
- How's Hightower?
- She's fine.

01:05:25.312 --> 01:05:27.010
Still at that hotel,
is she?

01:05:27.097 --> 01:05:30.317
Yes. Why do you ask?

01:05:30.404 --> 01:05:31.579
No reason.

01:05:31.666 --> 01:05:34.931
Okay.
Well, nice talking to you.

'Because the state cannot

01:05:46.768 --> 01:05:49.510
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:05:51.469 --> 01:05:53.514
Uh, did we have
a meeting scheduled?

01:05:53.601 --> 01:05:57.170
Uh, no, so listen, uh,
things went a little haywire

01:05:57.257 --> 01:05:59.477
with Hightower last night.
Someone tried to kill her.

01:05:59.564 --> 01:06:00.869
Oh?

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:02.610
Yes, which suggests
she's telling the truth

01:06:02.697 --> 01:06:03.742
about being framed.

01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:05.570
Well, maybe, but--

01:06:05.657 --> 01:06:08.399
The thing is, I can still
get her to come in peacefully

01:06:08.486 --> 01:06:11.445
but she insists
she wants to talk to you first

01:06:11.532 --> 01:06:13.534
face to face,
nail down a deal.

01:06:13.621 --> 01:06:16.276
- Me?
- She trusts you.

01:06:16.363 --> 01:06:18.365
Well, she should.

01:06:18.452 --> 01:06:23.066
Yeah, she...should, but I don't
know about any deal making.

01:06:23.153 --> 01:06:25.720
She's a loose cannon,
to say the least.

01:06:25.807 --> 01:06:28.419
She won't come in otherwise.

01:06:28.506 --> 01:06:30.812
She says she'll take her story
straight to the media.

01:06:30.899 --> 01:06:32.205
- That would not be good.
- No.

01:06:32.292 --> 01:06:34.903
That would be bad.

01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:36.644
So you'll do it.
Excellent.

01:06:36.731 --> 01:06:38.777
She wants to meet
at 2:00 p.m. on the dot.

01:06:38.864 --> 01:06:41.214
I will pick you up at 1:30.

W-Wait, wait. Uh..

01:06:45.914 --> 01:06:47.960
Alright, I'll do it.

- Hey, appreciate it.

- How much we owe you?
- It's on the CBI.

01:07:22.386 --> 01:07:24.214
- It's the least we can do.
- 'Oh, thank you.'

is who we're guarding in there.

it's a celebrity.

01:07:29.654 --> 01:07:31.351

I'd have to kill ya.

- And..
- Coffee, black.

loud and clear.

01:08:31.585 --> 01:08:33.544
Tap the table
if you can hear me.

- You got him, Rigs?
- Got him.

01:08:38.723 --> 01:08:40.377
And all the doors
in and out.

'We got tape on everyone
who enters the mall.'

If Red John comes,
we got him on camera.

If he comes.

01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:49.255
He will.

muttering to myself.

You don't seem nervous.

No. W-well, should
I be nervous?

Oh, thank you.
Thank you very much.

for this great food

01:09:44.962 --> 01:09:46.182
She's not coming,
is she?

01:09:49.314 --> 01:09:51.229
She'll be here.

01:09:51.317 --> 01:09:54.755
Just who exactly is trying
to kill her, anyhow?

01:09:54.842 --> 01:09:57.932
Well, it's hard to say.

01:09:58.019 --> 01:09:59.238
Who would be your guess?

01:09:59.325 --> 01:10:00.979
Well, I run
the department, Patrick.

01:10:01.066 --> 01:10:03.851
- I don't read case files.
- You have no idea at all?

01:10:03.938 --> 01:10:06.376
None. You tell me.

01:10:06.463 --> 01:10:08.726
Red John, of course.

01:10:08.813 --> 01:10:10.206
Oh, of course.

01:10:10.293 --> 01:10:12.860
I believe he has a friend
inside the CBI.

01:10:12.947 --> 01:10:15.341
Oh, another one. Oh, good Lord,
this man's a prodigy.

01:10:15.428 --> 01:10:18.126
I believe he has friends
all over the state.

01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:19.389
Powerful friends.

01:10:19.476 --> 01:10:22.218
- Oh, oh, come on.
- I'm serious.

01:10:22.305 --> 01:10:23.219
You know..

01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:27.875
I beg of you,
Patrick, seek help.

01:10:27.962 --> 01:10:32.271
I sound crazy, don't I?
Maybe I am.

01:10:32.358 --> 01:10:36.144
- Maybe I'm not.
- No, you don't sound crazy.

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:39.235
You just sound like a man
who's pushed himself too hard

01:10:39.322 --> 01:10:41.237
who's reached
the end of his rope.

01:10:41.324 --> 01:10:45.806
You need to take a break,
consult a therapist maybe.

01:10:45.893 --> 01:10:48.069
I-I know a lot of doc..
Excellent doctors.

01:10:48.156 --> 01:10:49.375
- Rope.
- Who have helped people--

01:10:49.462 --> 01:10:51.290
The rope.
Did you kill Todd Johnson?

01:10:51.377 --> 01:10:53.597
- What? N-no.
- Did you kill Todd Johnson?

01:10:53.684 --> 01:10:56.382
No! What is wrong with you?

01:10:56.469 --> 01:10:58.776
Rigsby, Cho,
she needed the rope

01:10:58.863 --> 01:11:00.647
to climb over the balcony
to get to the room below.

01:11:00.734 --> 01:11:04.260
She wasn't targeting room 605.
She was targeting room 505.

01:11:04.347 --> 01:11:06.174
'Room 505.'

01:11:07.611 --> 01:11:08.829
What's going on?

01:11:11.223 --> 01:11:13.269
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Van Pelt.

01:11:13.356 --> 01:11:14.748
This is
Agent O'Laughlin, FBI.

01:11:14.835 --> 01:11:16.402
We're here relieving
Agent Lisbon.

01:11:16.489 --> 01:11:19.405
- Good to meet ya.
- Yeah, likewise.

01:11:25.368 --> 01:11:27.108
Oh, you know what?

01:11:27.195 --> 01:11:28.675
- I left my phone in the car.
- Oh.

01:11:28.762 --> 01:11:30.373
- Can I have the keys?
- There you go.

01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:31.417
Thanks. Won't be a sec, alright?

01:11:31.504 --> 01:11:32.462
Okay.

01:11:34.899 --> 01:11:36.335
[gun cocks]

01:11:40.165 --> 01:11:41.775
Can you get the gate?

01:11:50.741 --> 01:11:51.916
[gunfire]

01:11:57.530 --> 01:11:59.097
Do you know
how beautiful you look?

01:11:59.184 --> 01:12:01.882
Oh, hush.

01:12:01.969 --> 01:12:03.144
[chuckles]

01:12:04.537 --> 01:12:05.886
[cellphone ringing]

01:12:09.455 --> 01:12:11.196
[Craig]
'Oh, come on.'

01:12:12.719 --> 01:12:14.939
[dramatic music]

01:12:28.169 --> 01:12:29.127
[tires screeching]

01:12:37.483 --> 01:12:41.574
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Jane,
this is totally unacceptable.

01:12:41.661 --> 01:12:43.446
If I don't get an immediate
and clear explanation

01:12:43.533 --> 01:12:45.230
on what the hell
is going on here.

01:12:45.317 --> 01:12:46.710
I'm walking away right now.

01:12:46.797 --> 01:12:50.061
Walk away. Walk away.

01:12:50.148 --> 01:12:51.715
Alright, there will be
consequences.

01:12:51.802 --> 01:12:53.456
Mark my words.

01:12:56.023 --> 01:12:57.460
Answer your damn phone.

01:12:58.983 --> 01:13:00.376
[cellphone vibrating]

01:13:07.774 --> 01:13:09.210
[Mimi]
'Mommy!'

01:13:09.297 --> 01:13:11.387
This is is what you're watching,
Mimi. No arguments.

01:13:11.474 --> 01:13:13.258
Your shows are
too grown up for Will.

01:13:13.345 --> 01:13:15.652
- Ya-hoo!
- You know that. You know it!

01:13:20.526 --> 01:13:22.615
[cellphone vibrating]

01:13:27.664 --> 01:13:29.230
[knock on door]

01:13:31.711 --> 01:13:33.800
Hey, Jane, hold on a sec.

01:13:35.933 --> 01:13:36.977
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, boss.

01:13:37.064 --> 01:13:38.022
Hey!

01:13:39.719 --> 01:13:41.504
- What's up?
- 'Lisbon, Listen to me.'

01:13:41.591 --> 01:13:43.854
It's not Bertram.
It's O'Laughlin.

01:13:43.941 --> 01:13:46.073
Oh, uh, Jane, I-I can't
hear you. What?

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:50.730
O'Laughlin. Red John's
man is O'Laughlin.

01:13:53.037 --> 01:13:54.560
[gunfire]

01:13:54.647 --> 01:13:57.345
[Grace]
'Lisbon! Oh, my God!'

01:13:57.433 --> 01:13:58.608
Lisbon.

01:13:59.783 --> 01:14:00.871
Don't move.

01:14:02.873 --> 01:14:04.657
What did you do, Craig?

01:14:04.744 --> 01:14:06.790
Sorry about this,
Grace, truly.

01:14:06.877 --> 01:14:08.531
I've grown genuinely
fond of you.

01:14:11.490 --> 01:14:14.624
I don't understand.
Why are you doing this?

01:14:14.711 --> 01:14:16.452
It's not you. It's me.

01:14:18.758 --> 01:14:19.759
[gunfire]

01:14:29.421 --> 01:14:31.379
[Mimi]
'Mom!'

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:33.991
[Madeleine]
'Stay there!'

01:14:34.078 --> 01:14:36.080
'Come on,
don't look! Don't look!'

01:14:36.167 --> 01:14:37.647
'Go in the room.
Come on.'

01:14:37.734 --> 01:14:38.909
[Lisbon coughing]

01:14:41.041 --> 01:14:43.696
Craig. Craig.

01:14:44.871 --> 01:14:46.438
Craig.

01:14:46.525 --> 01:14:47.483
Grace.

01:15:01.018 --> 01:15:03.673
Lisbon! Lisbon!

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:04.891
[gasps]

01:15:04.978 --> 01:15:06.153
[Patrick]
'Lisbon!'

01:15:08.591 --> 01:15:12.029
- Lisbon.
- O'Laughlin's dead.

01:15:12.116 --> 01:15:14.161
I'm wounded, but I'm okay.

01:15:16.555 --> 01:15:19.427
Grace, call 911
from the landline.

01:15:19.515 --> 01:15:20.820
Okay.

01:15:22.474 --> 01:15:23.519
Are you gonna be alright?

01:15:23.606 --> 01:15:25.564
[panting]

01:15:25.651 --> 01:15:26.913
I think I'll be alright.

01:15:28.088 --> 01:15:29.525
[sighs]

01:15:30.221 --> 01:15:31.875
[panting]

01:15:36.314 --> 01:15:37.620
Lisbon, listen to me.

01:15:37.707 --> 01:15:39.883
Can you get
O'Laughlin's phone?

01:15:39.970 --> 01:15:41.232
[groans]

01:15:46.803 --> 01:15:48.021
[groans]

01:15:52.417 --> 01:15:54.462
- 'I got it.'
- Great.

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:58.031
Press redial
and tell whoever answers..

01:15:59.729 --> 01:16:01.774
...tell him O'Laughlin is dead.

01:16:06.779 --> 01:16:08.564
[cellphone ringing]

01:16:08.651 --> 01:16:10.043
[cellphone ringing]

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:13.438
[cellphone ringing]

01:16:19.618 --> 01:16:20.967
Hey.

01:16:21.054 --> 01:16:24.405
This is Agent Lisbon.
O'Laughlin's dead.

01:16:25.842 --> 01:16:27.104
Oh, that's too bad.

01:16:29.585 --> 01:16:33.197
Never mind. You win some,
you lose some I guess.

01:16:41.335 --> 01:16:44.600
He says, never mind.
Win some, lose some.

01:16:48.386 --> 01:16:49.561
I'll call you back.

01:16:55.654 --> 01:16:57.830
[dramatic music]

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:05.751
[indistinct chattering]

01:17:15.413 --> 01:17:16.849
[music continues]

01:17:25.815 --> 01:17:27.033
Can I help you?

01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:29.470
Yeah.

01:17:29.557 --> 01:17:31.211
Who were you just speaking to?

01:17:31.298 --> 01:17:35.128
- Why is that your business?
- Don't play with me.

01:17:35.215 --> 01:17:36.739
Sir, I don't know what
your issues are

01:17:36.826 --> 01:17:38.741
but you're-you're making me
very uncomfortable.

01:17:38.828 --> 01:17:40.743
Were you not just speaking
to Teresa Lisbon?

01:17:40.830 --> 01:17:42.875
- To who?
- Who are you? What's your name?

01:17:42.962 --> 01:17:45.661
Do I need to call security?

01:17:45.748 --> 01:17:47.053
I'm just messing with ya.

01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:48.533
[chuckles]

01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:50.491
You know who I am.

01:17:51.797 --> 01:17:53.756
Tell me anyhow.

01:17:53.843 --> 01:17:56.976
I have many names.

01:17:57.063 --> 01:17:58.848
Some people call me Red John.

01:18:00.806 --> 01:18:02.068
[dramatic music]

01:18:16.648 --> 01:18:18.302
Mm-hmm.

01:18:19.825 --> 01:18:21.392
Hollow points.

01:18:22.828 --> 01:18:24.917
They make a fist-sized hole.

01:18:25.004 --> 01:18:27.354
'But I won't hurt you
if I don't need to.'

01:18:27.441 --> 01:18:31.707
It's great to meet you,
face to face so to speak.

01:18:31.794 --> 01:18:36.059
I mean, the last time I saw you,
everything was so hyper.

01:18:36.146 --> 01:18:39.410
So unrelaxed.

01:18:39.497 --> 01:18:42.065
It's hard to talk
in that kind of environment.

01:18:42.152 --> 01:18:45.721
How do I know you are
who you say you are?

01:18:45.808 --> 01:18:47.723
That's a deep question.

01:18:50.421 --> 01:18:52.249
How does anyone
really know who anyone is?

01:18:52.336 --> 01:18:53.729
Who are you?

01:18:53.816 --> 01:18:56.166
What do you want?

01:18:56.253 --> 01:18:58.516
When O'Laughlin told me
about your little trap

01:18:58.603 --> 01:19:00.779
I was so happy.

01:19:00.866 --> 01:19:04.696
Perfect opportunity to teach you
one last lesson in humility

01:19:04.783 --> 01:19:06.393
but no.

01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:09.570
You prevailed for once.
Bravo.

01:19:09.657 --> 01:19:13.618
'Sincerely, bravo. And you know
what? It's a good thing.'

01:19:13.705 --> 01:19:17.578
It confirms
what I've been thinking.

01:19:17.665 --> 01:19:20.146
- It is time to quit.
- Quit?

01:19:20.233 --> 01:19:22.366
Yeah, no more killing,
no more blood. Enough.

01:19:22.453 --> 01:19:25.935
Been there, done that.
I'm retiring.

01:19:26.022 --> 01:19:29.155
Give myself a new face,
a new identity.

01:19:29.242 --> 01:19:31.854
Start a new life.

01:19:31.941 --> 01:19:36.772
I have skills
and-and resources that I can use

01:19:36.859 --> 01:19:39.775
to really make a positive change
in this world for other people.

01:19:39.862 --> 01:19:41.602
You know, for children.

01:19:43.779 --> 01:19:46.085
I guess I've been..

01:19:46.172 --> 01:19:49.785
...pursuing my own dreams
for so long, that I just..

01:19:49.872 --> 01:19:52.962
I-I lost sight of what's
truly important in this world.

01:19:53.049 --> 01:19:55.703
I think that happens
to a lot of people, don't you?

01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:57.836
Am I supposed to laugh?

01:19:57.923 --> 01:19:59.577
Why are you telling me
all this?

01:19:59.664 --> 01:20:01.884
Well..

01:20:01.971 --> 01:20:04.234
I think we have a connection
that needs to be honored.

01:20:04.321 --> 01:20:05.888
I-I wanna say goodbye.

01:20:05.975 --> 01:20:08.586
I want to apologize..

01:20:08.673 --> 01:20:10.588
...for any pain
I might have caused you

01:20:10.675 --> 01:20:13.460
and I want to release you from
this curse you've been under.

01:20:13.547 --> 01:20:15.462
I'm not under a curse.

01:20:15.549 --> 01:20:18.030
Doomed to
an endless, angry search

01:20:18.117 --> 01:20:19.553
for a vengeance
you will never have.

01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:21.294
I would call that a curse,
wouldn't you?

01:20:21.381 --> 01:20:25.124
I look on it more as a hobby,
and I will have that vengeance.

01:20:25.211 --> 01:20:27.083
Vengeance? On-on..

01:20:27.170 --> 01:20:31.130
On what? Look at.. Look at me.
I'm just a regular guy.

01:20:31.217 --> 01:20:34.046
I bet you-you thought
I'd have horns, huh?

01:20:34.133 --> 01:20:37.441
Right? I'm not a monster.

01:20:37.528 --> 01:20:38.921
I'm not the devil.

01:20:39.008 --> 01:20:43.490
I'm just another human being
with flaws, and vices

01:20:43.577 --> 01:20:46.711
and problems
just like anybody else.

01:20:46.798 --> 01:20:48.495
Forget about me.

01:20:48.582 --> 01:20:50.846
I'm not worth
ruining your life over.

01:20:50.933 --> 01:20:53.065
Wherever you go,
you delusional freak

01:20:53.152 --> 01:20:55.241
I will find you,
and I will kill you.

01:20:55.328 --> 01:20:58.984
Andthen...then I will
forget about you.

01:20:59.071 --> 01:21:00.246
Tough guy.

01:21:03.075 --> 01:21:04.250
Here I am.

01:21:07.297 --> 01:21:10.691
Let's see what you can do.
Come on.

01:21:10.778 --> 01:21:13.042
You put that gun away,
and I'll show you what I can do.

01:21:13.129 --> 01:21:16.262
[snorts]
See how we sound?

01:21:16.349 --> 01:21:19.483
We sound like
kids...on a playground.

01:21:19.570 --> 01:21:22.529
Don't you see that
I-I'm trying to do you a favor?

01:21:22.616 --> 01:21:25.402
Seeking revenge..

01:21:25.489 --> 01:21:28.318
...is a waste
of your precious time.

01:21:28.405 --> 01:21:30.929
Your life is precious,
Patrick.

01:21:31.016 --> 01:21:34.237
Get on with that precious life.

01:21:34.324 --> 01:21:37.327
Find yourself a woman
to love, start a family.

01:21:37.414 --> 01:21:40.069
When you're dead.

01:21:40.156 --> 01:21:41.287
Okay.

01:21:45.639 --> 01:21:48.729
I thought you might
take that attitude.

01:21:48.816 --> 01:21:51.036
'Oh, well. I tried.'

01:21:52.995 --> 01:21:53.996
Goodbye.

01:21:55.911 --> 01:21:58.174
Hey, you can't just walk away.

01:21:58.261 --> 01:22:00.306
I can't?

01:22:00.393 --> 01:22:02.352
Your colleagues are gone.

01:22:02.439 --> 01:22:04.267
What can you do
to stop me?

01:22:04.354 --> 01:22:07.444
I don't know that
you reallyareRed John.

01:22:07.531 --> 01:22:08.662
Fair enough.

01:22:11.143 --> 01:22:15.800
Your wife was very clean.

01:22:15.887 --> 01:22:18.585
She smelled like coal tar soap
and lavender.

01:22:20.065 --> 01:22:20.979
[dramatic music]

01:22:23.068 --> 01:22:26.028
Your daughter
smelled like sweat..

01:22:27.377 --> 01:22:28.944
...and strawberries and cream.

01:22:30.641 --> 01:22:34.427
I expect it was some kind
of kids' shampoo.

01:22:37.822 --> 01:22:39.084
[dramatic music]

01:22:53.272 --> 01:22:55.274
Please, wait.

01:22:57.842 --> 01:22:59.017
[panting]

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:04.283
[gunfire]

01:23:04.370 --> 01:23:06.242
[screaming]

01:23:15.207 --> 01:23:16.730
[music continues]

01:23:44.976 --> 01:23:47.152
Can I get the check, please?

01:23:55.639 --> 01:23:57.902
[music continues]

01:24:25.538 --> 01:24:27.975
[Patrick]
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.

01:24:31.153 --> 01:24:32.154
