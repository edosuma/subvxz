00:08.105 --> 00:09.789
(Dr. Borden)
She can't remember who she is,

00:09.824 --> 00:11.285
where she came from,
nothing...

00:11.320 --> 00:14.321
before she crawled out
of that bag in Times Square.

00:14.356 --> 00:16.389
- (Mayfair) Do you recognize her?
- No.

00:16.425 --> 00:18.892
Then why is your name
tattooed on her back?

00:18.927 --> 00:21.594
(Patterson) All of her tattoos
are brand-new.

00:21.630 --> 00:22.796
(Weller)
It's a treasure map.

00:22.831 --> 00:24.664
(Mayfair)
It's a Navy Seal tattoo.

00:24.700 --> 00:27.334
If she was Navy, she'd
be in our database.

00:27.369 --> 00:29.069
Not if she was
Special Ops.

00:29.104 --> 00:30.470
Aah!

00:30.505 --> 00:32.305
(dishes breaking)

00:34.142 --> 00:35.775
(Weller) I know why my name
is on her back.

00:35.811 --> 00:38.611
I think Jane Doe
is Taylor Shaw.

00:38.647 --> 00:41.648
Taylor Shaw has been
missing for 25 years.

00:41.683 --> 00:43.483
And she's not
missing anymore.

00:43.518 --> 00:45.418
(Reade) We're not seriously gonna
keep doing this, are we?

00:45.454 --> 00:47.687
Blindly following
her tattoos is reckless.

00:47.723 --> 00:49.923
(Weller)
I don't know why.

00:49.958 --> 00:51.624
I don't know who.

00:51.660 --> 00:53.293
But someone sent her
back to me.

00:53.328 --> 00:54.527
(Mayfair)
That's impossible.

I'll tell you

02:46.842 --> 02:48.608
Did they find
the SEAL tattoo yet?

02:48.643 --> 02:50.610
(panting)

02:50.645 --> 02:53.146
Who did this to me?

02:53.181 --> 02:55.215
Why did they send
me to the FBI?

02:55.250 --> 02:57.116
You can't trust them.

03:23.378 --> 03:24.677
We don't know.
No signs of forced entry.

03:24.713 --> 03:26.112
Her detail
did a thorough sweep.

03:26.147 --> 03:27.447

get in there?

The shooter?

03:32.120 --> 03:33.152
Trajectory
suggests he was

03:33.188 --> 03:34.787

on the roof.

03:34.823 --> 03:36.089
The building's abandoned.

- I don't believe in ghosts!

is that we can't protect her.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.994

06:06.698 --> 06:08.235

06:19.077 --> 06:20.308
I can handle myself.

06:20.343 --> 06:22.379
I can see that.
But it's not what I asked.

06:23.749 --> 06:26.516
Do you trust the FBI
to keep you safe?

06:39.364 --> 06:41.097
The evidence from
the Taylor Shaw case

06:41.132 --> 06:42.237
arrived this morning.

Patterson thinks she can
have conclusive DNA results

06:44.866 --> 06:46.336
in the next eight hours.

06:46.371 --> 06:47.975
If Jane Doe
is Taylor Shaw,

06:48.010 --> 06:49.906
we'll know
by the end of the day.

06:49.942 --> 06:51.608
We should tell her
that we're doing this.

06:51.643 --> 06:53.443
Before the results?
Absolutely not.

06:53.479 --> 06:54.754
Why? She's part of
this investigation.

06:54.789 --> 06:56.513
She should be included.

06:56.548 --> 06:57.614
What if this
triggers a memory

06:57.649 --> 06:58.872
that breaks this
case wide open?

06:58.907 --> 07:01.766
<i>Assisting</i> this

07:01.801 --> 07:04.754
How can you be so sure
we can trust her?

07:04.790 --> 07:06.857
Look, what if you're
wrong about all this?

07:06.892 --> 07:08.959
Imagine how that's
gonna feel for Jane,

07:08.994 --> 07:10.760
finally thinking
she knows who she is,

07:10.796 --> 07:12.796
only to have it
stripped away again.

07:12.831 --> 07:14.931
Borden thinks toying
with her like that

07:14.967 --> 07:16.581
could damage
her trust in us,

07:16.616 --> 07:19.422
not to mention cause
unnecessary strife.

07:19.457 --> 07:21.457
No, we need to wait.

07:22.808 --> 07:24.341
I'm not wrong.

Which part?

08:01.632 --> 08:03.599

08:07.772 --> 08:09.204
Do we know who he was?

08:09.240 --> 08:11.073
No, he's the same
as you.

08:11.108 --> 08:14.576
No prints, no DNA,
no trace of him in the system.

08:14.612 --> 08:17.112
No, I... he...
I remember him.

08:17.148 --> 08:18.614
We used to know each other
before all of this.

08:18.649 --> 08:20.416
We trained together.

08:20.451 --> 08:23.152
I think
he was my friend.

08:23.187 --> 08:26.288
Did he say
anything to you?

You don't know

08:31.262 --> 08:32.828
How he got into
the safe house or...

08:32.863 --> 08:33.895
or who shot him?

08:33.931 --> 08:36.498
No. We're working
on it, Jane.

08:39.035 --> 08:41.636
No, he didn't say anything.
He didn't have time.

08:41.672 --> 08:45.274

to knowing who I am?

08:47.011 --> 08:48.010

11:13.945 --> 11:15.244
Until today.

11:15.279 --> 11:16.645
They got overconfident.

11:16.681 --> 11:18.414
That's the picture
witnesses paint.

11:18.449 --> 11:21.417
You figure out
who this guy is yet?

11:21.452 --> 11:22.818
Kind of.

11:24.060 --> 11:27.156
Prints just came back.
Casey Robek.

11:27.191 --> 11:29.325
Racked up quite a police
blotter as a juvenile.

11:29.360 --> 11:31.794
South Jersey kid, gets
into all sorts of trouble.

11:31.829 --> 11:33.629
When he was 18,
a shrink diagnosed him

11:33.664 --> 11:35.816
with high intelligence,
utter amorality,

11:35.851 --> 11:37.333
and inherent violence.

11:37.368 --> 11:38.934
So guess who
scoops him up.

11:38.970 --> 11:41.136
Someone who figured
they could add honor,

11:41.172 --> 11:42.938
courage, and commitment
to that list.

11:42.974 --> 11:44.273
The SEALs recruited him
right out of jail,

11:44.308 --> 11:45.407
along with his
older brother Travis

11:45.443 --> 11:46.809
and their friend Omar,

11:46.844 --> 11:48.577
and then they disappear
for about ten years.

11:48.612 --> 11:49.778
Not a single entry
in their file.

11:49.814 --> 11:50.946
- More ghosts.
- Yeah.

11:50.982 --> 11:51.890
Until two years ago.

11:51.925 --> 11:54.249
They all get
honorably discharged.

11:54.285 --> 11:56.251
Two years ago is
exactly when the Candymen

11:56.287 --> 11:57.753
started knocking over
jewelry stores.

11:57.788 --> 11:59.488
Pretty sure that's
not a coincidence.

11:59.523 --> 12:01.090
Now, these guys got black ops
written all over them.

12:01.125 --> 12:02.658
What are they
gonna do, retire?

12:02.693 --> 12:05.361
No... they're gonna put
their skills to work.

12:05.396 --> 12:06.882
All right, we gotta
find Travis and Omar.

12:06.917 --> 12:08.797
If Casey might have known
Jane, they might have too.

12:10.201 --> 12:12.468
So SEAL recruiters view
amorality as an asset?

12:12.503 --> 12:13.653
Yeah, what are
you saying?

12:13.688 --> 12:15.243
Jane was a SEAL.

12:15.807 --> 12:17.376
What is your
problem with her?

12:17.411 --> 12:18.717
We barely know her,
that's my problem.

12:18.752 --> 12:19.978
Look, I'm trusting
Weller on this one,

12:20.013 --> 12:20.859
and you should, too.

12:20.894 --> 12:22.651
Tell me the last time
a victim was invited

12:22.686 --> 12:24.895
to join their own
FBI investigation.

12:26.618 --> 12:28.167
That's all I'm saying.

12:31.232 --> 12:32.695
You guys familiar
with ALPR?

12:32.730 --> 12:34.030
Like the dog food?

12:34.065 --> 12:35.598
No, not...

12:35.633 --> 12:38.016
A-L-P-R... Automatic
License Plate Recognition.

12:38.051 --> 12:39.435
It tracks feeds
from toll booth

12:39.470 --> 12:41.170
and road rule
enforcement cameras.

12:41.206 --> 12:43.206
It's a mountain
of data, so...

12:43.241 --> 12:44.707
I started to look for plates

12:44.742 --> 12:47.043
having any connection to do
with our known suspects,

12:47.078 --> 12:49.745
and I got a hit...
late model sedan

12:49.781 --> 12:52.410
belonging to one of Casey
and Travis's cousins.

12:52.445 --> 12:54.128
According to its normal
patterns of behavior,

12:54.163 --> 12:56.452
it should be in an
office park in North Philly,

12:56.487 --> 12:57.787
where the cousin works.

12:57.822 --> 12:59.255
So where is it?

12:59.290 --> 13:02.258
Driving around the outer
boroughs of New York City.

13:02.293 --> 13:04.393
Anyone think
that's a coincidence?

13:07.599 --> 13:08.798
- Good timing.
- Whoa.

13:08.833 --> 13:10.709
Did he recognize you?

13:10.744 --> 13:12.101
No, he's still
in surgery.

13:12.136 --> 13:14.737
We think one of our suspects
is at a mini-mall in Queens.

13:14.772 --> 13:16.806
All right, catch me up
on the way.

13:31.956 --> 13:33.889
Should I get
one of those?

13:33.925 --> 13:37.126
You've got one.
It's there.

13:37.161 --> 13:38.728
It's attached
to the car.

13:38.763 --> 13:40.329
Yeah, so are you.

13:40.365 --> 13:43.332
Okay, you two,
a number of shops here.

13:43.368 --> 13:44.634
So we're gonna split up,

13:44.669 --> 13:46.435
clear 'em one by one.

13:46.471 --> 13:49.772
Jane, radio us if you
see him in the parking lot.

13:54.798 --> 13:56.169
Jane, please.

13:56.204 --> 13:57.647

I'm pretty useful

13:57.682 --> 13:59.248
in the field, no?

13:59.284 --> 14:00.781
Yeah, you have.

14:00.816 --> 14:02.151
That's exactly
why you're here.

14:02.186 --> 14:03.967
So hang back,
play safety for us.

14:04.002 --> 14:05.442
Keep an eye on
the parking lot.

14:05.477 --> 14:06.713
- No, I... I can...
- Jane...

the boundaries

14:07.635 --> 14:09.531

this team, that's fine.

14:09.566 --> 14:10.988
But not here, not now.

You should've called
us from the car radio.

21:35.576 --> 21:36.775
Manhattan has three marinas.

21:36.811 --> 21:39.745
North Cove,
Surfside 3/Chelsea Piers,

21:39.780 --> 21:41.447
and the 79th Street
Boat Basin.

None of 'em have
a boat moored there

21:42.750 --> 21:43.983

21:44.018 --> 21:45.651
Could be
using an alias.

21:45.686 --> 21:47.152
I've alerted the Coast Guard,
told 'em to check out

21:47.188 --> 21:49.321
anyone heading towards
international waters.

21:49.357 --> 21:50.923
And I've looped in NYPD,
they're gonna help us

21:50.958 --> 21:52.458

marinas at once.

to the hospital,

22:17.718 --> 22:19.018
and you run
the marina raid.

22:20.354 --> 22:22.354
Why?

22:22.390 --> 22:25.291
Feels like you're
a little close to this one.

22:25.326 --> 22:26.759
- I'm fine.
- You're not.

22:26.794 --> 22:28.294
Not when it
comes to Jane.

22:34.735 --> 22:36.001
You're wrong.

22:36.037 --> 22:39.071
All due respect,
I don't think I am.

No. Who am I,
Casey?

34:10.862 --> 34:12.962
(muttering)

34:13.998 --> 34:16.099
Wh-What? What?

34:16.134 --> 34:17.724
I ca...
What did you say?

34:17.759 --> 34:19.768
(muttering)

34:19.804 --> 34:22.871
(whispering)
Orion.

34:22.907 --> 34:25.641
Wh-wh...

34:34.686 --> 34:35.985
He's gone.

34:37.255 --> 34:38.821
I'm sorry, Jane.

34:41.693 --> 34:43.359
(sirens)

34:47.127 --> 34:49.364
(Mayfair, echoing)
You okay?

34:49.400 --> 34:50.565
(Weller, echoing)
We're fine.

34:50.601 --> 34:52.058
(Mayfair)
I want you both checked out.

34:52.092 --> 34:54.770
Come on, let's coordinate
with NYPD.

35:03.281 --> 35:05.281
I really am sorry, Jane.

35:06.784 --> 35:09.278
He...

35:09.313 --> 35:12.255
Every time we get close
to something real,

35:12.290 --> 35:15.224
it just slips
through my fingers.

35:21.132 --> 35:23.270
We have a theory...

35:23.305 --> 35:24.867
about who
you might be.

35:27.071 --> 35:30.601
And we wanted to
wait for DNA results

35:30.636 --> 35:32.475
before we told you.

35:33.645 --> 35:34.977
Who?

35:36.316 --> 35:38.277
When I was ten...

35:38.312 --> 35:40.685
my next-door neighbor
went missing.

35:40.720 --> 35:43.219
She was never found.

35:43.254 --> 35:45.087
Her name
was Taylor Shaw.

35:47.158 --> 35:48.791
Um...

35:48.826 --> 35:51.460
You're the same age.

35:51.496 --> 35:54.230
You have the same eyes.

35:54.265 --> 35:57.233
The same scar
on your neck.

35:57.268 --> 36:00.937
And my name...
tattooed on your back.

36:03.408 --> 36:05.007
You think I'm Taylor?

36:09.113 --> 36:11.881
You can trust me, Jane.

36:11.916 --> 36:14.317
I've been looking
for you my whole life.

36:19.857 --> 36:22.858
♪♪

36:34.175 --> 36:38.318
♪♪

36:38.353 --> 36:39.819
"Orion" is all
that he said?

36:39.855 --> 36:41.354
Yeah, that's right.

36:41.389 --> 36:42.334
(Mayfair)
Any ideas?

36:42.369 --> 36:44.324
It's a name,
it's a constellation,

36:44.359 --> 36:45.525
it's a city,
it's a myth.

36:45.560 --> 36:47.093
It is insanely vague.

36:47.129 --> 36:48.695
And you're sure
that he recognized her?

36:48.730 --> 36:51.631
He certainly seemed to,
but he was out of it.

36:51.666 --> 36:53.600
So Orion could
mean nothing.

36:53.635 --> 36:55.608
Are we any further
on Jane's attacker?

36:55.643 --> 36:57.604
No, that's starting to
look like a dead end.

36:57.639 --> 36:59.676
Just once I would like
to know something

36:59.711 --> 37:01.474
for certain
about this case.

37:01.510 --> 37:03.676
I know one thing
for certain.

37:03.712 --> 37:06.179
Jane is an
incredible asset.

37:06.214 --> 37:08.053
So we need to come to
some sort of understanding

37:08.088 --> 37:09.652
about her role with us.

37:09.687 --> 37:10.939
'Cause making those
decisions on the fly

37:10.974 --> 37:12.485
has been less
than successful.

37:23.231 --> 37:26.232
(faint office chatter)

37:28.703 --> 37:30.236
Am I in trouble?

37:30.272 --> 37:31.937
Rough day.

37:31.972 --> 37:34.467
Can't imagine what it
must be like for you.

37:34.502 --> 37:36.309
I want to thank you
for your assistance

37:36.344 --> 37:37.707
with these cases so far.

37:37.742 --> 37:39.212
But, moving forward,
I think we need

37:39.247 --> 37:40.747
to reevaluate your role.

37:40.782 --> 37:41.881
What?

37:41.917 --> 37:43.049
These tattoos
are leading us

37:43.084 --> 37:45.633
to increasingly
dangerous places.

37:45.668 --> 37:46.819
I can handle myself.

37:46.855 --> 37:48.488
We think it
would be better...

37:48.523 --> 37:50.112
I can't believe
you're doing this.

37:50.147 --> 37:51.791
...if you were armed.

37:53.191 --> 37:56.196
You'll need to pass field
certifications, of course.

37:56.231 --> 37:59.499
But, from what I hear,
it won't be a problem.

37:59.534 --> 38:02.068
Um...

38:02.103 --> 38:03.536
I'm on the team?

38:03.572 --> 38:08.035
Special Agents Weller,
Zapata, and Reade insisted.

38:08.070 --> 38:10.072
We still don't understand
what's happening to you,

38:10.107 --> 38:13.813
but... we think you need
to be part of figuring it out.

38:15.984 --> 38:17.617
I don't know
what to say.

38:17.652 --> 38:20.520
They trust you.

38:20.555 --> 38:22.922
So, I trust you.

38:24.869 --> 38:27.136
(office chatter)

38:35.045 --> 38:36.244
Thank you.

38:37.005 --> 38:38.238
Of course.

38:38.273 --> 38:40.543
I have so many
questions about Taylor.

38:40.578 --> 38:42.198
Hey, so sorry.

38:42.233 --> 38:44.544
Can I steal you
for just a second?

38:44.579 --> 38:45.712
What's up?

38:45.747 --> 38:47.676
Oh, uh, you know.

38:47.711 --> 38:49.816
The... the thing
that... that we...

38:49.851 --> 38:51.651
- Yeah, I told her.
- The results for like...

38:53.855 --> 38:55.121
You...

38:55.156 --> 38:56.256
Okay, so...

38:56.291 --> 38:57.366
(Weller)
Come here.

38:57.401 --> 38:59.800
We had your DNA tested

38:59.835 --> 39:01.995
to see if it
matched Taylor's.

39:04.199 --> 39:06.299
You have the results?

39:06.334 --> 39:07.700
Yes.

39:10.105 --> 39:12.122
Uh... are you sure
that we should...

39:12.157 --> 39:13.506
I don't know what the rules
are for this type of...

39:13.541 --> 39:15.108
It's fine.

39:15.143 --> 39:16.276
Tell us.

39:16.311 --> 39:18.175
They're a match.

39:18.210 --> 39:19.651
I ran it three times

39:19.686 --> 39:21.686
with three different
samples.

39:22.923 --> 39:25.166
You are Taylor Shaw.

39:53.882 --> 39:55.848
(silverware clinking)

39:58.753 --> 40:01.120
You know, we really shouldn't
be meeting like this.

40:01.156 --> 40:03.189
We agreed to keep
a healthy distance.

40:03.224 --> 40:04.457
I thought it
was important.

40:04.492 --> 40:05.725
Did you look
over the file?

40:05.760 --> 40:08.227
(chuckles)
Yes.

40:08.263 --> 40:12.532
Your Jane Doe is
definitely troubling.

40:12.567 --> 40:14.734
I'm growing increasingly
certain that the people

40:14.769 --> 40:17.370
who did this to Jane
know about Daylight.

40:17.405 --> 40:18.671
Well, if you're
really that convinced,

40:18.707 --> 40:20.673
then why is she
still alive?

40:20.709 --> 40:22.241
I didn't hear that.

40:22.277 --> 40:23.876
Look, if the girl
knows about Daylight,

40:23.912 --> 40:25.478
she needs to disappear.

40:25.513 --> 40:26.579
You don't get it.

40:26.614 --> 40:28.481
She doesn't know anything.

40:28.516 --> 40:29.801
It's the people
who did this to her,

40:29.836 --> 40:31.751
created this
insane treasure map...

40:31.786 --> 40:33.486
they're the ones
I'm worried about.

40:33.521 --> 40:35.521
Do we have any idea
who they are?

40:35.557 --> 40:36.809
Not yet.

40:36.844 --> 40:39.258
Then we need to take out
the liability we do know.

40:39.294 --> 40:41.020
- No.
- See, I've always been

40:41.055 --> 40:43.863
a "better safe
than sorry" guy myself.

40:43.898 --> 40:46.332
The tattoos are already
in the system.

40:46.368 --> 40:47.923
Killing her
won't undo that.

40:47.958 --> 40:51.437
It'll only make it worse,
draw more attention to it.

40:53.141 --> 40:54.691
I'm managing the situation.

40:54.726 --> 40:56.181
I just thought
you needed to know.

40:56.216 --> 40:57.276
You thought right.

40:57.312 --> 40:58.778
If that girl
has information

40:58.813 --> 41:00.713
about Daylight
on her body,

41:00.749 --> 41:03.216
then we are in
very serious trouble.

41:04.728 --> 41:06.193
There's only four people
in the world

41:06.228 --> 41:09.922
knew about that operation,
and one of them is already dead.

41:12.320 --> 41:14.727
Don't manage
the situation.

41:14.763 --> 41:16.496
Make it go away.
