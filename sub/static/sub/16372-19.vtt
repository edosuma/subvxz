WEBVTT

00:03.160 --> 00:05.629
Neuromuscular block abating.
Intercostals responding.

00:05.800 --> 00:09.350
- Push 20 milligrams Tramadol.
- SpO2 normal.

00:09.520 --> 00:11.000
Morgan?

00:11.400 --> 00:14.040
- Can you hear me, Morgan?
- Where am I? What's happening?

00:14.240 --> 00:16.391
- Why am I tied up?
- You're okay, Morgan.

00:16.560 --> 00:17.789
You are safe.

00:17.960 --> 00:19.633
We are here to help.

00:19.800 --> 00:21.871
But to do that...

00:22.080 --> 00:23.719
...I need to show you something...

00:23.880 --> 00:27.271
...and I need you to tell me
everything you know about it.

00:28.440 --> 00:31.114
Do you recognize this man?

00:31.800 --> 00:33.280
Think way back.

00:35.680 --> 00:37.478
Think hard, Morgan.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.673
What about that one?

00:42.560 --> 00:43.880
I don't know.

00:44.040 --> 00:45.474
Who is that?

00:47.760 --> 00:49.353
Wait, wait, wait. He's Drunchi.

00:49.520 --> 00:51.591
No, Drucci, Drucci.
I think his name's Drucci.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.320
What happened to Mr. Drucci?

00:56.680 --> 00:58.239
What?

01:05.080 --> 01:06.753
The murder.

01:06.960 --> 01:08.599
The trial.

01:08.760 --> 01:12.470
You work for... Wait. I told you people
I won't testify. I gave you my word.

01:12.640 --> 01:16.156
Mr. Brujo, I've been asked
by some very important people...

01:16.320 --> 01:19.791
...to make sure
you have no memory whatsoever...

01:19.960 --> 01:23.715
...of the events surrounding
the death of Nicholas Drucci.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.395
And I will do that.

01:29.920 --> 01:31.832
Take him to the stage three.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.720
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait. Who are...?

01:38.840 --> 01:40.399
Who the hell are you?

01:40.920 --> 01:42.593
How did you get in here?

01:42.760 --> 01:44.558
You can't be here.

01:45.760 --> 01:48.320
Dr. Krilov, I'm a friend of a friend.

01:48.480 --> 01:50.756
I'd like to discuss a proposal with you.

01:50.960 --> 01:53.031
May I buy you lunch?

02:00.240 --> 02:02.596
We identified three more
of Reddington's victims:

02:02.760 --> 02:05.639
Milos Kirchoff, Alistair Pitt...

02:05.800 --> 02:08.554
...and Geoff Perl.

02:08.720 --> 02:10.871
- Those names mean anything to you?
- No.

02:11.039 --> 02:14.477
Which is why I'm gonna pull the files
and see who the lead detectives were.

02:15.080 --> 02:17.640
They may know something
that can help me prove...

02:17.800 --> 02:20.554
...that Keen was tipping off Reddington.

02:20.720 --> 02:22.996
- What?
- If Reddington's being spoon-fed intel...

02:23.200 --> 02:24.873
...it's not gonna be from Keen.

02:25.080 --> 02:26.514
She shot the attorney general.

02:26.680 --> 02:29.593
- She went on the run with Reddington.
- They had a common enemy.

02:29.760 --> 02:31.558
Keen was being targeted by the Cabal.

02:31.720 --> 02:34.599
The same criminal organization
that was going after Reddington.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.598
The Bureau zeroed in on these three...

02:36.800 --> 02:38.951
...because they had intel on Reddington
that he didn't want us to find.

02:39.120 --> 02:43.194
So he disappeared them,
and, well, maybe Keen helped him do it.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.840
If she's got nothing to hide,
why's she ducking my calls?

02:48.840 --> 02:49.876
- Answer that.
- Ressler.

02:50.040 --> 02:53.158
This is Detective Elijah Bell,
Philly P.D., Southwest Division.

02:53.360 --> 02:54.999
<i>- How can I help you?
- I got a case.</i>

02:55.160 --> 02:58.710
<i>During a neighborhood canvass, I talked
to a woman named Linda McFaden.</i>

02:58.880 --> 03:00.599
<i>Didn't have squat on my case...</i>

03:00.760 --> 03:03.400
...but she had a story
about a body being moved up in D.C.

03:03.560 --> 03:05.552
<i>- Whose body?
- She had no idea.</i>

03:05.720 --> 03:08.030
<i>But I looked into the dates
and the location...</i>

03:08.200 --> 03:11.238
...and I think it may relate
to an investigation you were working:

03:11.400 --> 03:13.437
the disappearance of Reven Wright.

03:13.600 --> 03:16.240
<i>If that's still active,
you may wanna pay her a visit.</i>

03:16.400 --> 03:18.278
All right. Text me the address.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.350
I hate Mozart.

03:28.560 --> 03:30.279
I'll adjust my Christmas list.

03:30.480 --> 03:33.279
I've just heard too much of it.
It's like pop music to me.

03:33.480 --> 03:36.712
<i>Kate, on the other hand,
simply adores Don Giovanni.</i>

03:36.880 --> 03:39.111
- You found her.
- That was taken 18 hours ago...

03:39.320 --> 03:41.471
...at the CafÃ© Grundstein in Vienna...

03:41.640 --> 03:44.712
...where Mozart held one
of his last public performances.

03:45.440 --> 03:47.750
In the end, we're all creatures of habit.

03:47.920 --> 03:49.070
And the man she's with?

03:49.560 --> 03:52.359
Dr. Bogdan Ivanovich Krilov.

03:52.520 --> 03:57.072
One of the few people who've mastered
the science of memory manipulation.

03:57.240 --> 03:58.720
Science or science fiction?

03:59.640 --> 04:02.109
You, of all people,
should know the answer to that.

04:02.280 --> 04:03.999
I understand suppressing memories...

04:04.160 --> 04:06.800
...helping someone to mute out
a traumatic experience.

04:06.960 --> 04:10.397
- But manipulating them?
- The memory of an accident.

04:10.600 --> 04:12.398
A tragedy.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.437
A fire in which
a 4-year-old girl killed her father.

04:17.720 --> 04:20.757
This man, is he the one
who erased my memory of that night?

04:21.320 --> 04:22.834
That's how Kaplan knows him.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.992
Why is she meeting with him now?

04:25.200 --> 04:28.238
- Is it connected to the fire? To me?
- I don't know.

04:28.400 --> 04:29.720
But we have to find out.

04:29.880 --> 04:34.591
Which is why the next name
on the Blacklist is Dr. Krilov.

04:34.760 --> 04:38.231
We've confirmed that, after their meeting,
Krilov boarded a flight to New York.

04:38.400 --> 04:40.119
He landed in JFK four hours ago...

04:40.280 --> 04:43.717
...and told Passport Control he was
staying at the Winthrop Grand Hotel.

04:43.880 --> 04:47.317
Why is Kaplan interested in someone
with Krilov's peculiar skill set?

04:47.480 --> 04:49.711
Reddington doesn't know.
And he couldn't ask...

04:49.880 --> 04:52.031
...because Kaplan eluded
the photographer.

04:52.200 --> 04:54.317
Reddington's going to Vienna
to pick up the trail.

04:54.520 --> 04:55.556
Agent Keen...

04:55.720 --> 04:59.600
...I speak for all of us, my recollection of
the last memory specialist we dealt with...

05:00.400 --> 05:01.914
...was not a pleasant one.

05:02.080 --> 05:03.560
It's a brutal process.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.872
Ressler, Navabi, get to Krilov.
Find out what Kaplan wants with him.

05:07.040 --> 05:10.397
Sir, a new witness just came forward
in the Reven Wright case.

05:10.560 --> 05:11.596
I'll go with Samar.

05:11.760 --> 05:13.592
Fine, roll out.

05:13.760 --> 05:15.399
Hey, Keen.

05:15.960 --> 05:17.917
Give us a second, would you?

05:18.360 --> 05:20.317
Gale thinks
you're Reddington's informant.

05:20.480 --> 05:22.278
More reason for me to avoid his calls.

05:22.440 --> 05:25.512
I don't agree. He's already ID'd
the bodies of three Blacklisters:

05:25.720 --> 05:29.396
- Geoff Perl, Alistair Pitt, Milos Kirchoff.
- I'm not Reddington's informant.

05:29.560 --> 05:33.793
So tell him. It won't be a lie. It'll also
help hide the truth about the task force.

05:34.320 --> 05:36.152
We can't let him find out about that.

05:39.200 --> 05:41.476
Mr. Krilov checked in shortly after 9.

05:41.640 --> 05:45.759
Security logs indicate he left the hotel
after checking in and hasn't returned.

05:45.920 --> 05:47.912
I showed his photo to the bell service
and the doorman. No luck.

05:48.080 --> 05:51.960
If it helps, I assume he'll be returning.
This letter arrived for him after he left.

05:52.160 --> 05:54.152
- We need to take this.
- That won't be possible.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.630
Krilov's a person of interest
in a criminal investigation.

05:56.800 --> 06:00.271
I wanna be cooperative, but he's a guest
and that letter's private property.

06:00.440 --> 06:03.512
- I can't let you take it without a warrant.
- I understand.

06:03.680 --> 06:05.114
- I don't.
- Here you go.

06:07.080 --> 06:08.116
- Walk fast.
- Why?

06:08.280 --> 06:11.512
Because any second, he's gonna realize
he's holding my rent check.

06:13.760 --> 06:16.480
And here I thought you'd gone all pink
and perfect on me.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.310
The man who raised me was a grifter.

06:19.520 --> 06:21.318
Couldn't be pink and perfect if I tried.

06:21.800 --> 06:25.680
It's an invoice and arrival itinerary.
"Manilow Van Lines."

06:25.840 --> 06:27.593
Krilov's expecting a delivery.
Does it say what for?

06:27.760 --> 06:29.433
No, but it arrived last night.

06:29.960 --> 06:32.350
Well, unless you can palm
a cargo container...

06:32.520 --> 06:34.876
...I think this time,
you really will need a warrant.

06:35.080 --> 06:36.275
I just move them through.

06:36.440 --> 06:39.592
- Customs does inspections.
- You're not responsible for what we find.

06:39.760 --> 06:41.194
Here we go.

06:41.360 --> 06:44.319
Whatever's inside,
nobody's shown up to collect it.

06:50.920 --> 06:53.276
This is what,
a stash of medical equipment?

06:53.440 --> 06:55.909
Looks like Krilov was here
to manipulate some memories.

06:56.080 --> 06:57.116
Yeah.

06:57.280 --> 06:58.953
But whose?

06:59.120 --> 07:02.591
It's all over.
The FBI just seized my equipment.

07:02.760 --> 07:04.479
The mission cannot be compromised.

07:04.640 --> 07:07.838
<i>Well, it has been. I need my equipment.</i>

07:08.000 --> 07:09.354
And now they have it.

07:09.520 --> 07:11.955
<i>- I'll get you new equipment.
- It's not that easy.</i>

07:12.160 --> 07:14.152
My equipment is specialized.

07:14.320 --> 07:16.471
<i>You can't just replace it.</i>

07:16.640 --> 07:18.836
No one else does what I do.

07:19.040 --> 07:21.350
That's not exactly true.
Take out a pen and paper.

07:21.520 --> 07:23.034
I'm gonna give you a name.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.033
- Hello.
- Hello.

07:39.320 --> 07:40.356
Keep the change.

07:41.880 --> 07:43.234
This is too much.

07:43.440 --> 07:45.636
Perhaps I'll add to the order.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.757
I'm looking for this woman.

07:47.920 --> 07:52.711
I represent the estate of a dear aunt
who left her a sizable bequest.

07:52.880 --> 07:56.954
I was hoping you might have some
information that would help me find her.

07:58.720 --> 08:02.031
I don't know where she's staying,
but she was here when we opened.

08:02.200 --> 08:03.236
With a suitcase.

08:03.960 --> 08:05.076
Perhaps the train?

08:05.240 --> 08:07.232
We're only a few blocks from Wien-Mitte.

08:07.400 --> 08:08.720
Thank you, my dear.

08:08.920 --> 08:11.594
We'll take the Sachertorte to go.

08:12.800 --> 08:16.430
So you told Detective Bell
that you saw some people moving a body.

08:16.640 --> 08:19.109
I'm... I'm not sure.

08:19.280 --> 08:23.115
It was dark, across the street.
I probably shouldn't have said anything.

08:23.280 --> 08:25.511
Coming forward's hard.
Most people don't.

08:25.680 --> 08:27.034
You did the right thing.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.839
- You know who my neighbor was?
- Yes.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.959
- Laurel Hitchin.
- The president's national-security advisor.

08:32.120 --> 08:35.397
Whatever it was, it...
It was coming out of her house.

08:35.559 --> 08:38.155
Well, I have a reason to believe
that "it" was a person.

08:38.320 --> 08:39.356
Reven Wright.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.989
The second-highest-ranking official
in the Justice Department.

08:42.159 --> 08:43.799
I need you to tell me what you saw.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.196
What I saw could get me killed.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.716
Why do you think I came here
to stay with my sister?

08:49.400 --> 08:52.393
I did it to hide from what I saw.
To forget it.

08:55.560 --> 08:56.880
Can you forget it though?

08:57.440 --> 09:00.353
Linda, tell me what you saw.

09:01.640 --> 09:05.031
Hey, you guys. Okay, so after Krilov
didn't show up at the hotel...

09:05.200 --> 09:07.556
...Mr. Cooper issued an APB
and it paid off.

09:07.720 --> 09:09.120
You got a location for him?

09:09.280 --> 09:12.352
A cop spotted him on a subway platform,
but lost him in the crowd.

09:12.520 --> 09:15.957
So I pulled the security feeds
from the street outside the station.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.190
That was Gale again.

09:17.360 --> 09:19.955
- Third time today.
- You know my vote. Stay away.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.675
I agree, and these days,
we don't agree on anything...

09:22.840 --> 09:24.797
...so, you know,
it's gotta be good advice.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.798
It looks like he's watching someone.

09:28.240 --> 09:29.879
There, that woman.

09:30.040 --> 09:32.794
Oh, my God. That's Dr. Selma Orchard.

09:32.960 --> 09:36.237
The unpleasant recollection
you had about the last specialist...

09:36.400 --> 09:39.837
- ...who looked into my memory. That's her.
- Maybe they're colleagues.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.434
Keep running the feed.

09:41.640 --> 09:43.916
I don't think they're colleagues.
Looks like she's his target.

09:44.080 --> 09:46.914
The equipment she used on me
was similar to what we seized.

09:47.080 --> 09:50.152
Krilov needs a lab so he's going
after someone who can supply him one.

09:50.360 --> 09:54.354
Aram, pull up Selma Orchard's number.
We need to get to her before Krilov does.

09:56.760 --> 09:59.719
- This is Dr. Orchard.
- Dr. Orchard, this is Elizabeth Keen.

09:59.880 --> 10:04.238
Listen carefully. There's a man coming
for you. His name is Bogdan Krilov.

10:04.400 --> 10:07.359
Hello? Dr. Orchard?

10:09.720 --> 10:11.837
A forgetful memory specialist.

10:14.680 --> 10:18.037
Is it ironic or an oxymoron?

10:20.640 --> 10:22.279
I can never tell the difference.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.879
You found him. Grand. Please, sit.

10:38.280 --> 10:40.033
Is everything okay, sir?

10:40.240 --> 10:44.871
Marvelous, I have such a fondness
for the little snacks from the bar car.

10:45.080 --> 10:48.517
The crackers and cheeses,
the sausages. It's like camping.

10:48.680 --> 10:52.276
Try the peppered one there.
It's surprisingly good.

10:52.440 --> 10:54.238
Your friend has a gun.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.074
He does, but he'll have
little use for it...

10:57.240 --> 10:59.800
...so long as you assist me
in locating a passenger.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.838
Her name is unimportant...

11:02.000 --> 11:05.630
...as her ticket was likely purchased
under any number of aliases.

11:05.800 --> 11:10.079
Which is why I'll need to see all
of the various passenger manifests...

11:10.240 --> 11:12.596
- ...leaving from Wien-Mitte.
- I can't do that.

11:12.760 --> 11:16.674
How long has it been
since your rail line has had a robbery?

11:17.080 --> 11:20.596
- What?
- A robbery. A stickup, like the Old West.

11:20.760 --> 11:22.080
What are you talking about?

11:22.280 --> 11:24.795
I'm talking about making you stop
this train...

11:24.960 --> 11:28.636
...while my associate and I rob
your passengers...

11:28.800 --> 11:30.280
...of their money and jewelry.

11:30.440 --> 11:34.275
I must admit, I've always been
somewhat seduced by the idea.

11:34.440 --> 11:39.037
Bill Miner, the old Grey Fox,
Butch Cassidy...

11:39.200 --> 11:42.034
...but I've never really felt the itch
until now.

11:42.200 --> 11:43.839
So you're gonna walk back to...

11:44.440 --> 11:47.274
...wherever it is you walk to
and get the manifests...

11:47.440 --> 11:49.909
...or I'm gonna stop this train,
take your money...

11:50.080 --> 11:54.199
...and give this rail line
the most ridiculous PR disaster...

11:54.400 --> 11:58.474
...since the Newton Boys robbed
that mail train in Rondout.

12:05.920 --> 12:09.038
I won't say anything.
I won't. I won't. I swear.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.000
Please, I have a son.

12:11.160 --> 12:14.437
I don't care about the equipment.
Keep it. Just keep it.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.239
It's all packed up.

12:17.200 --> 12:20.159
I know what you do.
Your work, it's really incredible.

12:20.320 --> 12:23.597
If you'd have asked me,
I would've given you my equipment.

12:24.720 --> 12:28.600
I wish I could've taken the chance.

12:31.640 --> 12:33.632
I really do.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.356
Please, I'm begging you.

12:49.240 --> 12:50.720
FBI! Federal agents.

12:50.880 --> 12:52.473
Let's see your hands.

12:53.520 --> 12:54.840
Dr. Orchard?

12:55.040 --> 12:56.474
Selma?

12:57.760 --> 12:59.240
Okay. You're gonna be okay.

12:59.400 --> 13:00.436
- It's okay.
- He's gone.

13:00.600 --> 13:02.910
This is Agent Elizabeth Keen
with the FBI.

13:03.080 --> 13:06.073
I need a medical team, Priority 3.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.152
There were three men.

13:08.320 --> 13:11.392
I didn't see a body at first.

13:11.600 --> 13:14.991
Just a rug or a rolled-up tarp.

13:15.160 --> 13:17.550
But when they put it
in the back of the van...

13:17.720 --> 13:19.473
...it sort of...

13:19.640 --> 13:21.871
That's okay. Take your time.

13:22.920 --> 13:24.400
It unrolled...

13:24.560 --> 13:27.951
- ...and I saw a foot.
- I'm gonna need you to come to D.C...

13:28.160 --> 13:29.833
- ...to make a statement.
- I can't.

13:55.040 --> 13:57.760
Dispatch routed me through
to the Vienna station agent.

13:57.920 --> 14:02.233
This is a list of all the paid passengers
who boarded today.

14:05.360 --> 14:07.431
Here, Susan Stahley.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.432
She wasn't on the early morning train.

14:09.600 --> 14:13.879
That's this train. One of our sleepers.
B-12, four cars back.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.200
The woman, there was a woman.

14:18.360 --> 14:21.637
Yes, she got off at the last stop.
You must be Raymond.

14:22.440 --> 14:24.272
She said you might come.

14:24.440 --> 14:25.794
Said to give you this.

14:28.720 --> 14:30.234
Thank you.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.674
- Hello, Raymond.
- You can't keep up this wild-goose chase.

14:39.840 --> 14:40.910
I'm gonna find you.

14:41.720 --> 14:44.030
I'll save you the trouble.
I'm heading to Lucerne.

14:44.200 --> 14:47.637
We'll need the jet. Call Edward,
tell him we'll get off at the next stop.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.031
You remember what's in Lucerne,
don't you?

14:50.240 --> 14:52.038
<i>- Kate.
- I'm so sorry, Raymond.</i>

14:52.240 --> 14:56.200
I can't talk now. My car just arrived.
I'll call you when I get there.

15:00.480 --> 15:02.631
<i>You heard me. Selma Orchard.</i>

15:02.800 --> 15:04.678
Kaplan sent Krilov to Orchard?

15:05.240 --> 15:06.515
<i>I don't like the connection.</i>

15:06.680 --> 15:09.149
To me? Now you do think
this is about my memory?

15:09.320 --> 15:10.595
I don't know.

15:10.800 --> 15:13.793
Not long ago, the idea
that Kate would hurt you to get to me...

15:13.960 --> 15:15.030
...was unthinkable.

15:15.200 --> 15:20.229
But the Kate I'm after now
is difficult to recognize.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.555
The bodies,
the ones Julian Gale is investigating.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.154
- I need the list.
- The list?

15:25.360 --> 15:28.159
The FBI's forensic experts are trying
to identify the remains.

15:28.360 --> 15:31.080
I need the list of the ones
who've been identified so far.

15:31.280 --> 15:33.556
<i>As quickly as you can,
and send it to Dembe.</i>

15:36.000 --> 15:37.195
Why did he do this?

15:37.360 --> 15:39.477
Krilov was hired
to adjust someone's memory...

15:39.640 --> 15:41.472
...and we confiscated his lab.

15:41.640 --> 15:42.710
So he stole yours.

15:42.920 --> 15:45.230
But your memory, the night of the fire...

15:45.400 --> 15:47.232
He stole it from me 25 years ago.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.232
That's why we needed you
to get it back.

15:50.800 --> 15:52.075
Is this about that night?

15:53.160 --> 15:55.117
We won't know until we find him.

15:55.280 --> 15:57.875
- Do you have any idea where he went?
- No.

15:59.600 --> 16:01.796
But my equipment might.

16:03.560 --> 16:05.074
Hey, Dr. Orchard was right.

16:05.240 --> 16:07.800
- Her equipment may help us find Krilov.
- How?

16:07.960 --> 16:10.395
The EEG machine he stole
is state of the art.

16:10.560 --> 16:12.711
Designed to receive updates
from a main server.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.314
It's part of a wireless network.

16:14.480 --> 16:17.951
Which we can use to locate the machine
and Krilov once he turns it on.

16:18.160 --> 16:20.277
Did you get a list of bodies
Julian Gale ID'd?

16:20.440 --> 16:22.511
Yeah, Mr. Cooper did.

16:23.040 --> 16:25.396
What is Mr. Reddington gonna do with it?

16:43.400 --> 16:47.235
Agent Ressler,
I think it's time we had a heart-to-heart.

16:51.400 --> 16:55.474
Raymond, the list of victims
from Agent Keen.

17:04.040 --> 17:05.076
Hans.

17:10.200 --> 17:14.319
- Kate, you made good time.
- I assume you know why I'm here.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.872
I told you the bodies
I unearthed would destroy you.

17:18.040 --> 17:19.633
That each one would tell a story.

17:19.800 --> 17:20.994
You don't need to do this.

17:21.160 --> 17:23.435
We're way past that point, deary.

17:23.640 --> 17:27.077
You can't change what you've done,
and you can't stop what's coming.

17:27.240 --> 17:29.118
<i>Your own sins, Raymond.</i>

17:29.280 --> 17:31.556
You did this to yourself.

17:35.720 --> 17:36.756
My word.

17:36.920 --> 17:41.233
So this is you. The Mr. Kaplan
my people whisper about.

17:41.400 --> 17:44.040
Reddington's hidden protector.

17:44.200 --> 17:46.590
The fairy tale come to life.

17:46.760 --> 17:49.753
Mr. Von Hauser, thank you for seeing me.

17:50.440 --> 17:53.990
I'm quite real. Though you're right,
Raymond and I prefer to keep...

17:54.160 --> 17:56.720
...my role in his affairs to ourselves.

17:56.880 --> 17:59.111
He certainly doesn't approve
of my visit today.

17:59.280 --> 18:03.274
And yet, you have chosen
to defy his wishes?

18:03.600 --> 18:06.399
I don't have to tell you
how dangerous that can be.

18:06.600 --> 18:07.636
No.

18:07.800 --> 18:10.793
But I'm here
because I have something to tell you.

18:10.960 --> 18:15.512
A story that, I'm sorry to say,
will cause you profound grief and anger.

18:15.680 --> 18:16.909
About?

18:17.920 --> 18:18.990
Hans.

18:19.760 --> 18:22.320
<i>He was Werner's son.</i>

18:22.480 --> 18:24.756
A formidable young man.

18:24.920 --> 18:28.118
Early 20s, already in the family business.

18:28.280 --> 18:31.273
Understand, this was 25 years ago now.

18:31.440 --> 18:32.954
I was...

18:33.120 --> 18:35.430
...younger myself.

18:37.040 --> 18:40.431
Intent on building an empire.

18:40.640 --> 18:42.711
Intent on becoming...

18:42.880 --> 18:47.033
...the powerful criminal
the world had been told I already was.

18:47.680 --> 18:50.275
<i>Werner was very impressive to me then.</i>

18:50.480 --> 18:53.120
International weapons dealer,
a smuggler.

18:53.280 --> 18:57.559
A jack-of-almost-every-illicit-trade
one might imagine.

18:58.120 --> 19:00.510
I wanted an alliance...

19:01.000 --> 19:03.879
...to become
Werner's most trusted associate.

19:04.080 --> 19:08.791
Raymond crafted a plan
based on an ancient principle.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.959
If you want your enemy
to become your friend...

19:12.120 --> 19:14.589
...create a problem for him
and then solve it.

19:14.760 --> 19:17.400
You're talking about Hans's abduction?

19:18.080 --> 19:21.039
<i>You're telling me
Reddington was behind it?</i>

19:21.520 --> 19:24.399
<i>The idea was simple enough.</i>

19:24.600 --> 19:28.150
<i>To make it appear
as if Hans had been kidnapped.</i>

19:28.320 --> 19:31.279
To send Werner a ransom demand.

19:31.480 --> 19:33.711
Ten million or his son would be killed.

19:34.600 --> 19:38.355
At that point, I would intervene.
Talk to the brutal abductors...

19:38.520 --> 19:41.433
...convince them
they should release Hans unharmed.

19:41.600 --> 19:44.991
They would agree, of course,
out of respect to me and my reputation...

19:45.200 --> 19:47.715
...as a man not to be crossed.

19:48.240 --> 19:50.232
<i>Werner would be deeply grateful.</i>

19:50.400 --> 19:52.073
<i>And so...</i>

19:52.240 --> 19:54.630
<i>- ...my enemy would become my friend.
- No, no, no.</i>

19:54.800 --> 19:57.269
Hans was taken
by the Taddicken brothers.

19:57.440 --> 19:59.636
Known around the world
for their savagery.

19:59.840 --> 20:01.638
Yes. That's why Raymond chose them.

20:01.840 --> 20:05.197
They were given very clear instructions
not to harm your son.

20:05.360 --> 20:08.273
<i>Unfortunately,
they didn't follow those instructions.</i>

20:08.440 --> 20:12.150
The Taddicken brothers
were careless, reckless.

20:12.560 --> 20:14.916
Hans was suffocated while in transit.

20:16.080 --> 20:19.471
Tragic. Unforgivable. Raymond was...

20:19.640 --> 20:21.677
<i>Horrified.</i>

20:21.840 --> 20:23.718
Devastated.

20:26.840 --> 20:30.550
In a rage, I obliterated
the Taddicken brothers.

20:30.720 --> 20:35.875
And Mr. Kaplan saw
to the disposal of Hans's body.

20:36.280 --> 20:39.239
<i>Werner was beyond bereft.</i>

20:40.440 --> 20:43.478
But he was also very grateful to me.

20:43.640 --> 20:46.519
The man who had killed the...

20:46.720 --> 20:49.713
...animals responsible
for murdering his only son.

20:51.400 --> 20:54.711
<i>It remains one
of my most profound regrets.</i>

20:58.280 --> 21:02.069
But of course,
I never told Werner the truth.

21:04.400 --> 21:07.234
Instead, we began one
of the most profitable alliances...

21:07.400 --> 21:09.676
<i>...in modern criminal history.</i>

21:09.840 --> 21:13.470
An alliance that has remained intact
for decades.

21:15.160 --> 21:18.278
Can you prove what you have told me?

21:18.440 --> 21:21.239
I can do better than that, Mr. Von Hauser.

21:21.400 --> 21:23.551
I can return your son's body...

21:23.760 --> 21:26.559
...so you can give him the burial
he was so wrongly denied.

21:26.960 --> 21:30.749
At this moment, his remains are
in the custody of the FBI.

21:32.560 --> 21:35.120
Where's Linda McFaden?
You tell me now, or I swear...

21:35.280 --> 21:37.795
Donald, enough
with the Reven Wright thing. Come on.

21:37.960 --> 21:40.429
You have no power to interfere
with my investigation.

21:40.600 --> 21:41.795
- None.
- "No power"? Really?

21:41.960 --> 21:43.872
I'm White House
national-security advisor.

21:44.040 --> 21:47.431
My interference is the least
of your problems.

21:47.600 --> 21:51.116
See, if I choose to,
I'll simply remove you from the equation.

21:51.280 --> 21:53.237
Do I make myself clear?

21:53.400 --> 21:56.677
- Let it go, Agent Ressler.
- I'm not going without my witness.

21:56.840 --> 21:58.752
Damn it. I don't wanna hurt that girl...

21:58.960 --> 22:02.920
...but you and your pursuit
of another Boy Scout honor badge...

22:03.080 --> 22:06.630
...have forced my hand,
and now I have no choice.

22:06.840 --> 22:08.194
Get out.

22:08.400 --> 22:09.675
Shoo.

22:19.480 --> 22:23.918
Hey, remember,
you did this to her, not me.

22:24.080 --> 22:26.800
You did this to her, not me.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.630
He has accepted the fiction
that he is in her car...

22:32.800 --> 22:34.200
...talking with Hitchin.

22:35.280 --> 22:37.476
We should have no problem...

22:37.640 --> 22:42.715
...uploading
the remaining selected memories.

22:46.760 --> 22:48.194
Gale.

22:50.040 --> 22:52.600
George, why do you have empty hands?

22:54.000 --> 22:55.798
You know how I don't like empty hands.

22:55.960 --> 22:58.919
Sorry, boss. I put in a request
for those files you asked for.

22:59.080 --> 23:02.551
- Yeah?
- Geoff Perl, Alistair Pitt, Milos Kirchoff.

23:02.720 --> 23:05.440
But those files are designated SCI7.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.478
- SCI...?
- Seven.

23:08.880 --> 23:11.440
- Never heard of that.
- Pretty sure that's the point.

23:12.200 --> 23:14.874
I wonder what's so special
about those three cases.

23:15.080 --> 23:19.552
Three? Try every case in the east wall
of Main Records, plus the annex.

23:19.720 --> 23:22.713
We're talking hundreds
and hundreds of legal boxes.

23:22.920 --> 23:25.435
Hundreds, huh?
And they're all off-limits.

23:26.720 --> 23:28.757
Now we're getting somewhere, Georgie.

23:30.880 --> 23:31.916
<i>You found Krilov?</i>

23:32.440 --> 23:34.955
The equipment he's using,
Dr. Orchard's EEG...

23:35.120 --> 23:38.192
...it is pinging the manufacturer's server.
I'm tracking the signal.

23:38.360 --> 23:41.194
Does getting the signal mean
he's using the EEG on someone?

23:41.360 --> 23:44.080
- Yeah. Unfortunately.
- There. Where is that?

23:44.720 --> 23:47.997
A clinic in Rockville, Maryland.
Shut down nearly a decade ago.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.436
You two, get there now.

23:52.320 --> 23:55.757
You're arriving outside
of Laurel Hitchin's estate.

23:55.920 --> 23:57.832
<i>You believe the witness is inside.</i>

23:58.400 --> 24:02.633
<i>You know you need to make
a move soon. Time is wasting.</i>

24:06.840 --> 24:07.990
It's time.

24:08.600 --> 24:12.276
Unhook him. He's ready for transport.

24:15.240 --> 24:17.835
- You didn't kill his son.
- No.

24:18.720 --> 24:21.758
But Werner won't see it that way, will he?

24:22.080 --> 24:25.960
- Then why are we driving to his home?
- I have no alternative.

24:26.120 --> 24:29.716
- I believe this is a bad idea, Raymond.
- I'll handle Werner.

24:29.880 --> 24:32.873
It's Kate who has me on tenterhooks.

24:33.720 --> 24:37.475
We put out one fire, she starts another.
The woman is an arsonist.

24:37.640 --> 24:41.077
She's not gonna stop
until she burns me to the ground.

24:58.760 --> 25:00.672
- I'm unarmed.
- Who was here?!

25:00.840 --> 25:03.400
Your patient,
the person Kaplan hired you to work on?

25:03.800 --> 25:05.280
You don't remember me, do you?

25:05.480 --> 25:08.154
I know who you are. The memories
you took from me when I was a girl.

25:08.360 --> 25:11.512
Trust me, we're gonna talk about that.
But first, your patient, where is he?

25:13.280 --> 25:14.839
Liz.

25:17.440 --> 25:18.476
Ressler.

25:19.040 --> 25:22.272
He was an excellent patient.
Very pliable, unlike you.

25:25.280 --> 25:28.000
Definitely not pink or perfect.

25:40.400 --> 25:43.950
This isn't right. Since when does
he have so much security?

25:44.120 --> 25:46.999
Since today.
Nikolaus, how are you, my friend?

25:47.160 --> 25:50.039
Very well, Mr. Reddington. Thank you.

25:50.200 --> 25:53.830
If you don't mind,
we need to wand you and your man.

26:03.960 --> 26:05.474
A change in protocol, I see.

26:07.240 --> 26:08.560
Orders of Mr. Von Hauser.

26:15.040 --> 26:16.838
Werner.

26:17.760 --> 26:20.753
Thank you for agreeing to hear me out.

26:21.400 --> 26:23.960
I promised to meet with you.

26:24.120 --> 26:26.635
I never said I would listen to you.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.630
Our relationship is built on a lie.

26:30.800 --> 26:31.836
A tragedy.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.471
The fact that you walked into this room
confirms you know nothing about me.

26:35.920 --> 26:39.357
You severely underestimated
my love for my son.

26:39.520 --> 26:41.910
Then and now.

26:42.520 --> 26:45.274
And for that, you will pay with your life.

26:49.080 --> 26:51.390
I deserve to pay.

26:53.920 --> 26:54.956
But I can't.

27:01.280 --> 27:04.114
I never underestimated you, Werner.

27:04.280 --> 27:06.112
I just hoped things could work out.

27:06.280 --> 27:07.555
Nikolaus?

27:07.720 --> 27:11.760
Nikolaus has been on my payroll since
I introduced him to you 25 years ago.

27:12.680 --> 27:16.993
I knew, one day, we would have to look
each other in the eye and face the truth.

27:17.160 --> 27:21.359
And I knew it would be an event
that one of us would not recover from.

27:21.960 --> 27:26.955
Your abiding love for your son
was always evident to me, Werner.

27:27.600 --> 27:29.796
The loss of Hans...

27:30.520 --> 27:33.513
...there are no words
to duly express my remorse.

27:33.680 --> 27:35.433
I'm sorry for that.

27:35.600 --> 27:37.080
And I'm...

27:37.840 --> 27:39.752
I'm sorry for this.

27:46.600 --> 27:48.990
His men outside will be pouring in
any minute.

27:49.160 --> 27:52.358
Some will stand with me,
but it's a house divided.

27:52.560 --> 27:56.679
Unless you want to join a civil war,
you need to exit out back into the woods.

27:56.840 --> 27:58.752
Thank you for your loyalty, Nikolaus.

27:59.600 --> 28:00.875
I'll be in touch.

28:10.800 --> 28:12.200
Where's Agent Ressler?

28:12.360 --> 28:14.352
We know you were contracted to, what...

28:14.520 --> 28:16.591
...erase some kind of memory,
embed one?

28:17.640 --> 28:19.518
I want my lawyer.

28:21.960 --> 28:23.792
I'm not gonna ask again.

28:23.960 --> 28:26.236
I already told you, princess.

28:26.400 --> 28:30.360
I'm not talking to you
until my lawyer is present.

28:36.760 --> 28:40.071
- What are you doing?
- I told him I'm not gonna ask again.

28:40.280 --> 28:42.237
- Liz, hang on.
- Are you serious?

28:43.080 --> 28:45.436
Come on. You are FBI.

28:45.600 --> 28:49.389
You think I actually believe
you are going to inject that needle?

28:50.080 --> 28:54.632
You know, unfortunately,
I don't know much about Propofol.

28:56.200 --> 28:58.396
I think it's a general anesthetic.

28:58.560 --> 29:01.553
Can you even inject this directly
into the arm?

29:01.760 --> 29:03.433
- Stop it.
- I don't know. You tell me.

29:03.600 --> 29:05.990
- You're the doctor, princess.
- Agent Keen.

29:06.160 --> 29:07.674
- Hey.
- Would mainlining this...

29:07.840 --> 29:10.435
- ...cause long-term damage to the heart?
- Liz.

29:10.640 --> 29:14.429
The lungs? The kidneys?
Would it kill an old man?

29:14.600 --> 29:17.240
Okay, okay. Stop it. I'll tell you.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.359
Keep talking.

29:22.520 --> 29:24.751
There is a house...

29:25.520 --> 29:27.477
...on the Potomac.

29:27.640 --> 29:29.518
<i>Aram, I texted you an address.</i>

29:29.680 --> 29:32.195
<i>Laurel Hitchin's house on the river.
We're on our way.</i>

29:32.360 --> 29:34.750
Laurel Hitchin? What?
What happened with Krilov?

29:34.960 --> 29:39.159
We have him in custody.
His target, Kaplan's target, was Ressler.

29:39.320 --> 29:42.199
- Oh, my God.
- Agent Ressler? He was in Philadelphia.

29:42.360 --> 29:44.716
He was. He was abducted
and pumped full of drugs.

29:44.880 --> 29:49.352
<i>We think Krilov somehow programmed
Ressler to believe Hitchin abducted...</i>

29:49.520 --> 29:52.080
...a witness that could connect her
to Reven's murder.

29:52.240 --> 29:55.472
- Ressler wasn't with Krilov?
- No, Krilov's men already moved him.

29:55.640 --> 29:58.030
<i>They're positioning him
to go after Hitchin.</i>

29:58.200 --> 29:59.475
<i>We tried to warn her,
but couldn't reach her.</i>

29:59.640 --> 30:01.711
If Kaplan is behind this
to hurt Reddington...

30:01.880 --> 30:03.599
...how does using Ressler
to take out Hitchin help?

30:03.960 --> 30:07.795
<i>Kaplan gave us the chance to abandon
our relationship with Reddington.</i>

30:07.960 --> 30:12.079
We didn't. Now she'll take every step
necessary to dismantle the task force.

30:12.240 --> 30:14.152
- Starting with Ressler.
- Without the task force...

30:14.320 --> 30:15.879
...Reddington would be exposed.

30:16.080 --> 30:18.993
I have the address.
Routing backup to meet you there now.

30:19.920 --> 30:21.752
Everything set?

30:26.760 --> 30:29.355
Let's go. He'll wake up soon.

31:15.600 --> 31:16.670
Don't.

31:18.800 --> 31:19.836
Come on.

31:30.360 --> 31:32.397
- Where's Linda?
- Ressler, that shot...

31:32.560 --> 31:35.120
- Where is she?!
- What is the meaning of this? Who is he?

31:35.280 --> 31:36.839
Donald Ressler, FBI.

31:37.040 --> 31:40.158
Miss Hitchin here is a prime suspect
in Reven Wright's murder.

31:40.320 --> 31:43.199
Agent Ressler isn't well,
Mr. Ambassador. He needs help.

31:43.360 --> 31:46.114
Oh, Mr. Ambassador.
Is he part of the Cabal as well?

31:46.280 --> 31:48.795
Yes, Donald. He is. We all are.

31:48.960 --> 31:50.917
It's all one big global conspiracy...

31:51.080 --> 31:53.640
...and you weren't invited
to the party. Sorry.

31:54.480 --> 31:55.994
Well, I think you should go.

31:56.160 --> 31:58.152
- I will do no such thing.
- I think you will.

31:58.960 --> 32:01.429
- Now.
- It's okay.

32:01.600 --> 32:03.990
I'm fine. He's delusional, not dangerous.

32:09.160 --> 32:11.994
The witness, Linda McFaden,
where are you keeping her?

32:12.200 --> 32:15.796
First of all, I don't know any Linda.
Put the gun away, we can work this out.

32:15.960 --> 32:17.394
No way you'd let her out of your sight.

32:17.560 --> 32:20.394
Not when she's the only person
that can tie you to Reven's murder.

32:21.080 --> 32:23.276
See, I think you're keeping her here.

32:23.440 --> 32:26.990
That's what we're gonna do. We're gonna
go through this place room by room.

32:27.160 --> 32:28.276
Now let's go.

32:28.880 --> 32:31.475
Fine. Let's go.

32:33.880 --> 32:37.920
As soon as we hit the road,
we'll find a way to the jet.

32:38.080 --> 32:40.720
The jet is sitting on one
of Werner's airstrips.

32:40.880 --> 32:42.519
No doubt his men are on it now...

32:42.680 --> 32:45.149
...drinking my Scotch
and seeing who fits in my suits.

32:45.320 --> 32:47.516
Then we'll have to find
another way out of here.

32:47.680 --> 32:51.833
Without Werner or his contacts,
shipping lanes, airfields...

32:52.000 --> 32:55.072
...I can't do anything
from Gibraltar to the Urals.

32:55.280 --> 32:58.159
Every piece of his machinery
is up in the air now.

32:58.320 --> 33:00.437
And where they land is anybody's guess.

33:00.600 --> 33:03.957
For the time being,
we'll have to be comfortable with chaos.

33:21.560 --> 33:23.279
Stay with him.

33:24.520 --> 33:26.034
Help is on the way.

33:26.200 --> 33:29.716
- Like I said, there's nobody here.
- Then you're gonna tell me.

33:29.880 --> 33:33.271
- Tell me where you're holding her or I...
- Ressler, stand down!

33:33.440 --> 33:37.673
Keen, I found a witness who saw
Hitchin's men dispose of Reven's body.

33:37.840 --> 33:39.354
- There is no witness.
- Thank you.

33:39.520 --> 33:42.399
What are you talking about?
I met her. She told me everything.

33:42.560 --> 33:44.995
Listen to your partner.
You're ill. You need help.

33:45.160 --> 33:48.756
You're not ill. Your memory was
manipulated by Dr. Bogdan Krilov.

33:48.960 --> 33:51.395
- We have him in custody.
- I know what I saw. Trust me.

33:51.560 --> 33:54.712
No, you need to trust me.
The detective who reached out to you?

33:55.240 --> 33:57.960
<i>- Elijah Bell.
- There is no Elijah Bell in the Philly P.D.</i>

33:58.120 --> 34:00.715
<i>He works with Krilov,
so does your witness.</i>

34:00.880 --> 34:02.314
No. No.

34:02.480 --> 34:05.791
<i>I was at her house, okay?
I was there when she was taken.</i>

34:05.960 --> 34:08.679
<i>By Krilov's men.
He staged the whole thing.</i>

34:08.840 --> 34:12.356
Hitchin wasn't involved. During the raid,
you were knocked out, unconscious.

34:12.520 --> 34:15.831
<i>That's when Krilov started
to work on you, implanting memories.</i>

34:16.000 --> 34:18.231
<i>Hitchin coming to pick you up.</i>

34:18.400 --> 34:19.550
Agent Ressler.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.435
- How do you know that?
- Krilov made it up.

34:23.360 --> 34:25.795
- Krilov staged the whole thing.
- No.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.594
- We won't let her get away with this. No.
- You're right.

34:28.760 --> 34:30.797
We will find justice for Reven.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.400
Just not this way.

34:34.159 --> 34:36.594
Ressler, look at your hand.

34:40.920 --> 34:42.911
You were drugged.

34:44.320 --> 34:45.913
<i>Propofol. Tramadol.</i>

34:47.760 --> 34:49.274
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

34:52.800 --> 34:54.393
You're the victim here.

34:54.560 --> 34:58.998
- He's the victim? I mean...
- Yes, and you're a murderer.

35:00.280 --> 35:02.749
And one day we're gonna prove it.

35:06.480 --> 35:10.394
Every part of this little drama, Kate,
is playing out as grand tragedy.

35:10.840 --> 35:12.752
Family feuds always do.

35:13.960 --> 35:17.840
- Werner's dead.
- Oh, Raymond.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.959
You may have bitten the hand
that feeds you this time, deary.

35:21.120 --> 35:25.353
Every one of Werner's allies will be
out hunting to put you down.

35:25.560 --> 35:29.395
Are you going to cry havoc
and let slip the dogs of war, Raymond?

35:29.880 --> 35:31.439
Goodbye, Kate.

35:34.840 --> 35:38.390
Agent Ressler, sorry,
but I'm gonna need your sidearm.

35:38.560 --> 35:40.597
- Is that necessary?
- Yes, sir, it is.

35:40.760 --> 35:42.513
What are you doing?

35:44.440 --> 35:45.840
Can you turn around for me?

35:46.000 --> 35:48.276
Ressler is the victim.
He was manipulated and drugged.

35:48.440 --> 35:50.830
I'm sure
the investigation will bear that out.

35:51.040 --> 35:53.271
But in the meantime, he's in our custody.

35:54.200 --> 35:55.634
Sir.

36:03.120 --> 36:04.679
Sorry.

36:05.800 --> 36:07.598
I really wanna thank you, Agent Keen.

36:07.760 --> 36:11.231
I genuinely believe he would've shot me
if you hadn't shown up.

36:11.400 --> 36:14.598
- I didn't do it for you. I did it for him.
- Fair, but you did it.

36:14.760 --> 36:16.353
And for that I'm grateful.

36:16.520 --> 36:19.752
Donald Ressler represents
what's best about this country.

36:19.920 --> 36:23.470
He's loyal and honest,
and he believes that no one...

36:23.640 --> 36:25.836
...no one, is above the law.

36:26.000 --> 36:30.916
And I believe that, one day, you'll be
the one being dragged off in handcuffs.

36:31.320 --> 36:34.631
And he'll be walking into his lake house
to watch the sunset.

36:35.600 --> 36:37.080
Yeah.

36:37.240 --> 36:39.436
Never gonna happen.

36:44.320 --> 36:49.031
I want every detail.
What you did, how you did it.

36:49.200 --> 36:52.272
What memories you implanted
in Agent Ressler's consciousness.

36:53.560 --> 36:56.029
And what you took away.

36:56.560 --> 36:59.792
You're going to give me everything
we need to exonerate him.

37:01.040 --> 37:04.431
I could do that, I suppose...

37:04.600 --> 37:07.274
...if properly motivated.

37:10.440 --> 37:12.159
You don't remember me, do you?

37:12.320 --> 37:14.437
From 25 years ago, no.

37:14.600 --> 37:17.195
But then you wouldn't be very good
at your job if I did.

37:18.280 --> 37:22.513
No, not 25 years ago. Just two.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.356
What are you talking about?

37:27.520 --> 37:32.834
You were brought to me
by a mutual acquaintance of ours...

37:33.000 --> 37:37.040
...who wanted me to take
certain memories away from you.

37:39.880 --> 37:42.270
- What memories?
- Let's just say...

37:42.440 --> 37:48.357
...you had uncovered certain truth
about Raymond Reddington...

37:49.120 --> 37:51.589
...and he couldn't have that.

37:53.240 --> 37:54.754
You're lying.

37:54.960 --> 37:57.395
No, I'm not lying.

37:58.880 --> 38:01.031
And I think you know that.

38:01.200 --> 38:03.635
So let's make a deal.

38:03.840 --> 38:05.957
Full immunity.

38:06.120 --> 38:07.918
I walk.

38:08.360 --> 38:12.957
In exchange for the memories
I took from you.

38:15.120 --> 38:16.952
That's not gonna happen.

38:18.720 --> 38:22.031
That is a shame for all of us.

38:22.800 --> 38:26.760
But more so for you than me, I suspect.

38:27.960 --> 38:32.000
And for the Agent Ressler, of course.

38:33.160 --> 38:34.992
Two years ago.

38:35.160 --> 38:37.436
Two, not 25. Two.

38:38.080 --> 38:39.753
Kaplan is using Krilov.

38:39.960 --> 38:42.031
What was the secret
you needed Krilov to take?

38:42.200 --> 38:47.480
Nothing. She's using him to pull
at threads to continue to unravel my life.

38:47.640 --> 38:51.236
He sidelined Ressler.
He's trying to do the same to you.

38:51.400 --> 38:54.598
- You did it once.
- Yes, when you were a child...

38:54.760 --> 38:57.878
...to protect you from the memory
of killing your father.

38:58.040 --> 38:59.997
<i>I hired Krilov once.</i>

39:00.160 --> 39:01.753
<i>Never again.</i>

39:03.280 --> 39:04.475
That's Julian Gale.

39:04.640 --> 39:07.474
I've been avoiding his calls.
I'm thinking that was a mistake.

39:07.640 --> 39:13.113
Bogdan Krilov, Julian Gale, directly
or indirectly, they're working for Kaplan.

39:13.280 --> 39:15.351
<i>- Against us.
- Against you.</i>

39:15.960 --> 39:19.431
I'd think that would be
a difficult distinction for you to make.

39:19.760 --> 39:24.357
Speak with him if you must.
All I ask is you don't do it in anger.

39:24.520 --> 39:27.957
I wouldn't want you to say anything
either of us would regret.

40:07.120 --> 40:09.555
Some of them were killed
because they were trying...

40:09.760 --> 40:11.513
...to help us catch Reddington.

40:11.720 --> 40:14.076
I asked them to inform.
I promised them protection.

40:14.240 --> 40:18.678
And, well, I failed, and here they are.

40:18.840 --> 40:22.436
- You must be Agent Gale.
- Charmed, I'm sure.

40:23.040 --> 40:27.080
Speaking of charmed,
I hear Reddington can be very charming.

40:28.040 --> 40:30.430
What was it like going on the run
with him?

40:30.600 --> 40:34.196
- Did he charm you?
- I was a fugitive.

40:34.360 --> 40:36.192
It was awful.

40:37.560 --> 40:42.237
September 23rd, 2013.
Does that date ring a bell?

40:42.400 --> 40:44.153
- Should it?
- Well, it should for you.

40:44.320 --> 40:47.677
See, that's the day that you went
from being a rookie profiler...

40:47.880 --> 40:49.473
...to a classified assignment.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.913
I would remember.
How about October 1st, 2013?

40:53.080 --> 40:55.720
Nothing? Really?

40:55.880 --> 40:59.635
See, that's the day that the Reddington
task force started to fall apart.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.516
- I don't know anything about that.
- No?

41:04.680 --> 41:07.240
How about SCI7?

41:07.440 --> 41:09.113
You ever hear that?

41:09.720 --> 41:10.790
Never have.

41:10.960 --> 41:13.236
Apparently,
it's a designation that the Bureau...

41:13.400 --> 41:15.960
...reserves for certain high-profile cases.

41:16.160 --> 41:20.393
It's classified, so I can't look at the files
or interview heroes of law enforcement...

41:20.560 --> 41:22.995
...that are doing such important work.

41:23.160 --> 41:29.031
However, I was able to pinpoint
the first time that designation was used.

41:29.560 --> 41:31.392
You care for another date?

41:31.560 --> 41:33.995
- See, I love dates.
- Is there a question here?

41:34.160 --> 41:36.197
No, but... But there's a pattern.

41:36.360 --> 41:41.116
See, there was a rash of major cases
that were solved, hundreds of them...

41:41.280 --> 41:44.591
...starting the weeks
after you were plucked from obscurity.

41:45.240 --> 41:48.551
Reddington's been feeding
the Bureau intel.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.071
Big names.

41:51.240 --> 41:53.835
SCI7-big.

41:54.000 --> 41:57.038
Names that the Bureau
never knew existed.

41:57.840 --> 41:59.399
He's feeding them to you.

41:59.560 --> 42:01.199
And in exchange...

42:01.360 --> 42:04.592
...you're allowing him to stay
one step ahead of the law. That right?

42:04.760 --> 42:06.717
- Why did you want to see me?
- I didn't.

42:06.920 --> 42:09.071
I wanted you to see them.

42:09.760 --> 42:11.558
See, I've already asked them...

42:11.720 --> 42:15.191
...for their forgiveness
for my part in their being here.

42:16.360 --> 42:19.353
I wanted to give you a chance
to do the same.
