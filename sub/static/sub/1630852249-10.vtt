WEBVTT

00:04.320 --> 00:06.120
It's such a shame you can't come.

00:07.280 --> 00:09.040
Yes, I'm sorry, too.

00:09.040 --> 00:10.960
You shouldn't be going either.

00:10.960 --> 00:12.280
Nobody made you own up.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.120
There's no point us all missing out.

00:15.440 --> 00:17.120
Come on, Darrell.

00:17.120 --> 00:19.280
How could I have considered
her a friend?

00:19.280 --> 00:21.840
It's a French franc, round silver.

00:23.640 --> 00:25.720
I had it here earlier. I...

00:25.720 --> 00:27.520
I'll retrace my steps.

00:30.800 --> 00:32.080
Oh, it's here.

00:39.520 --> 00:42.840
Everyone, before we go, listen up.

00:42.840 --> 00:45.920
My new pen and Gwen's mother's
brooch are both still missing.

00:45.920 --> 00:48.680
And Mary-Lou's lucky coin
has vamoosed too.

00:48.680 --> 00:51.520
Irene, how about your hair clip?
Still no luck.

00:51.520 --> 00:53.920
And Georgina's compact never
turned up, either.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.640
I think we might have a thief.

00:55.640 --> 00:57.920
No Malory Towers
girl would ever steal.

00:57.920 --> 00:59.680
Well, I'm going to find them out.

00:59.680 --> 01:01.520
Inspector Jones.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.760
No, please don't ruin the trip.

01:03.760 --> 01:05.480
It's going to be ever so jolly.

01:05.480 --> 01:07.880
And ices, you are still paying,
aren't you, Gwen?

01:07.880 --> 01:09.600
Oh, yes. Raspberry ripple for me.

01:09.600 --> 01:12.280
VEHICLE BEEPS CLAXON

01:09.600 --> 01:12.280
The bus is here.

01:12.280 --> 01:13.400
Oh, hat.

01:18.560 --> 01:20.520
Buck up, Gwen, can't miss the bus.

01:20.520 --> 01:22.320
Need you for ice creams.

01:22.320 --> 01:24.200
Won't be a tick, I've just...

01:27.240 --> 01:30.280
Wait up, I'm going to check the
bathroom for my coin.

02:02.760 --> 02:04.520
They haven't gone yet, have they?

02:04.520 --> 02:06.280
I thought you were on the bus.

02:06.280 --> 02:09.720
Oh. I was so looking forward
to that trip.

02:09.720 --> 02:11.280
So was I.

02:11.280 --> 02:14.400
I've been looking everywhere
for you and that coin.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.920
Oh, that is kind.

02:17.360 --> 02:19.960
Well, we'll have to tell
Miss Grayling. Come on.

02:19.960 --> 02:21.720
Come on, Mary-Lou.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.640
Gwendoline, Mary Lou, why
aren't you on the trip?

02:28.640 --> 02:30.960
You're not in trouble as well,
are you? That was my fault.

02:30.960 --> 02:33.520
Gwen was helping me look for
something and they left without us.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.800
Really, Mary-Lou, surely you
could've waited to you were

02:35.800 --> 02:38.360
back to continue your search.
Qu'est que c'est, quatre filles?

02:38.360 --> 02:41.040
Gwen and Mary-Lou missed the bus.
Would you find them an activity?

02:41.040 --> 02:43.440
Oui, bien sur. Go and wait for me
by the classrooms.

02:43.440 --> 02:46.800
Girls, are on your way, pick up a
packed lunch from Cook for later.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.200
Um, Miss Grayling, have you
found a new investor?

02:49.200 --> 02:51.080
What? A new investor?

02:51.080 --> 02:54.480
Mam'zelle didn't tell you?
But of course I didn't.

02:54.480 --> 02:56.880
Such nonsense. It's the...
..under the school.

02:56.880 --> 02:59.840
Mr Thomas wants to knock
down Malory Towers and build a mine.

02:59.840 --> 03:02.520
Where did you hear this?
Gwen heard him talking to Georgina.

03:02.520 --> 03:05.000
These girls and their stories...
It's not just a story.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.640
Darrell, please, don't answer back.

03:06.640 --> 03:08.120
You must leave this to me now.

03:08.120 --> 03:11.640
Miss Grayling, please, you have to
listen to me... Darrell.

03:11.640 --> 03:14.280
It is just the girls
telling tall tales again.

03:15.480 --> 03:17.640
Well, let's hope you're right.

03:31.440 --> 03:33.640
Cook made spam
sandwiches with pickle.

03:35.440 --> 03:38.680
Such a shame, I won't be able
to buy ices for everyone now.

03:38.680 --> 03:41.080
And so Miss Grayling will look
into it, won't she?

03:41.080 --> 03:43.560
This is really serious.

03:41.080 --> 03:43.560
GIRLS TALK OVER EACH OTHER

03:43.560 --> 03:45.040
Silence, s'il vous plait.

03:46.240 --> 03:48.920
Maintenant, Darrell et Sally,
your punishment.

03:48.920 --> 03:51.920
You will make this floor worthy
of our feet.

03:51.920 --> 03:54.280
If you need one, there is a
broom in my cupboard.

03:54.280 --> 03:56.240
Here is the key. Do not lose it.

03:57.720 --> 03:59.880
Oh, dear. Hard work.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.560
Quelle domage.

04:01.560 --> 04:03.440
Tres bien, Gwendoline.

04:03.440 --> 04:06.920
J'ai un bonne idee.
You two can be my French assistants.

04:06.920 --> 04:10.440
French. But why? It wasn't my
fault I missed the bus.

04:10.440 --> 04:12.960
Oh, would you rather
clean the floor?

04:12.960 --> 04:15.040
Absolutely not.

04:16.040 --> 04:17.200
Bien!

04:17.200 --> 04:19.320
You'll help prepare
lessons for the first form.

04:19.320 --> 04:20.920
Allons-y, allez.

04:22.240 --> 04:23.680
Allez, Gwen.

04:31.840 --> 04:33.560
Actually, I would like to see you.

04:33.560 --> 04:36.240
DOOR OPENS

04:33.560 --> 04:36.240
Perfect.

04:36.240 --> 04:37.760
I'll be there at two.

04:39.960 --> 04:43.480
That was our solicitor, I'm afraid
Darrell was right about Mr Thomas.

04:44.960 --> 04:47.200
He's made a planning application.

04:47.200 --> 04:50.040
He...he will destroy Malory Towers?

04:51.040 --> 04:52.720
It looks that way, yes.

04:52.720 --> 04:56.560
I thought it was just
the girls tittle-tattling?

04:56.560 --> 04:59.120
I don't think Darrell
is the tittle-tattle type.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.760
You're right, I am sorry.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
I need you to be discreet,
Mam'zelle, but unless I can find

05:09.000 --> 05:10.760
an alternative investor...

05:12.080 --> 05:14.760
..the school will have to
close anyway.

05:17.960 --> 05:19.880
I had no idea.

05:19.880 --> 05:22.720
Please, try not to worry,
Mam'zelle,

05:22.720 --> 05:25.680
Malory Towers will not
go without a fight.

05:36.320 --> 05:37.960
Le chien.

05:37.960 --> 05:40.760
Do you see? They can match the words
to the pictures.

05:40.760 --> 05:43.160
Le chien? That's a dog.

05:43.160 --> 05:46.560
You know that. The first year's
will love it.

05:57.120 --> 05:59.400
I have some sharper scissors
in the dorm.

05:59.400 --> 06:00.600
Just go and fetch them.

06:00.600 --> 06:03.160
I'll come too, I can have a look
for my coin as well.

06:03.160 --> 06:04.760
No, it's OK. You keep going.

06:04.760 --> 06:05.920
I'll be straight back.

06:09.520 --> 06:11.920
Bonjour, le chien, bonjour.

06:11.920 --> 06:13.800
SHE CHUCKLES

06:13.800 --> 06:15.800
Woof-woof, woof-woof.

06:31.880 --> 06:33.920
IN FRENCH ACCENT: Darrell Rivers.

06:33.920 --> 06:35.880
Attention!

06:37.680 --> 06:40.360
I will never listen to
a word you say,

06:40.360 --> 06:43.760
but tu es tres

06:43.760 --> 06:45.600
boring.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.240
I am so not.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.400
Prove it.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.200
Fine.

06:51.400 --> 06:53.400
Go on.

06:51.400 --> 06:53.400
THEY CHUCKLE

06:59.960 --> 07:01.960
No head of form today.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.080
Just you and me.

07:03.080 --> 07:04.560
Let's make this fun.

07:06.680 --> 07:08.800
THEY CHUCKLE

07:29.000 --> 07:30.280
Gwen!

07:37.160 --> 07:38.800
Oh, I thought you were
going to be quick.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.280
Mam'zelle came back,
she was cross you weren't there.

07:41.280 --> 07:43.040
I was looking for your lucky coin.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.320
It's odd that it disappeared.

07:46.320 --> 07:48.800
Unless you think someone
might be taking things.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.600
How rotten is that?

07:52.120 --> 07:55.160
Come on. It must be here somewhere.

07:57.640 --> 07:59.560
You go, I've got to tidy my bed.

07:59.560 --> 08:01.640
I don't want to get an order mark.

08:01.640 --> 08:05.600
I'll wait, Mam'zelle will be cross
if she sees me without you again.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.560
No, looking for your lucky coin
is far more important.

08:08.560 --> 08:10.600
I'll sort the bed out later.

08:10.600 --> 08:11.920
Come on.

08:11.920 --> 08:14.400
I think I had it in the classroom.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.800
DARELL SCREAMS AND LAUGHS

08:23.640 --> 08:24.680
Oh!

08:26.560 --> 08:29.440
Look, Sally, the height marks.

08:30.640 --> 08:33.160
Must be Miss Grayling's brothers
and sisters.

08:33.160 --> 08:34.480
Yes, from when they lived here.

08:34.480 --> 08:36.160
Lizzie?

08:36.160 --> 08:38.000
That must be Miss Grayling.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.680
Lizzie's short for Elizabeth.

08:39.680 --> 08:41.920
And Min must be the youngest.

08:41.920 --> 08:44.680
Laurie, Rupert, Lizzie and Min.

08:44.680 --> 08:47.160
Ah, they must have had a hoot
growing up here,

08:47.160 --> 08:48.440
I mean, all this space.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.280
Come on. Let's not waste time.

08:50.280 --> 08:53.560
What happened to fun?
Don't be a goose.

08:53.560 --> 08:55.720
Let's go again.

08:55.720 --> 08:57.720
DARRELL LAUGHS

08:55.720 --> 08:57.720
Ready?

08:57.720 --> 08:59.120
Three, two, one...

09:00.240 --> 09:01.880
Girls. Oh...

09:01.880 --> 09:04.560
Oh, my. Miss Grayling, I'm so sorry.

09:06.960 --> 09:09.240
We used to do
that when I was little.

09:09.240 --> 09:12.760
We got into terrible trouble once
breaking one of Mother's vases.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.400
Do you remember these?

09:14.400 --> 09:16.120
We found a name of sorts.

09:21.720 --> 09:24.120
I'd forgotten they were here.

09:24.120 --> 09:26.160
Father used to measure us.

09:27.480 --> 09:29.200
Laurie always cheated.

09:31.040 --> 09:33.080
He'd stand on his tiptoes.

09:33.080 --> 09:34.840
Min used to get so cross with him.

09:36.280 --> 09:37.800
Poor little Min.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.400
Measles took her.

09:42.400 --> 09:43.920
She was only six.

09:43.920 --> 09:45.320
That's so sad.

09:45.320 --> 09:46.920
I'm sorry.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.680
I often think of her.

09:48.680 --> 09:51.320
You must have so many memories.

09:51.320 --> 09:53.120
Happy ones, mostly.

09:53.120 --> 09:56.120
You can't let Mr Thomas build a
mine. This is your home.

09:56.120 --> 09:57.800
You can't lose it.

09:57.800 --> 10:02.040
If there is a way, Darrell,
believe me, I will find it.

10:03.200 --> 10:06.080
Now, aren't you two supposed
to be cleaning?

10:11.120 --> 10:12.840
I think we'll be all right.

10:12.840 --> 10:14.160
It has to be.

10:14.160 --> 10:16.120
Come on,
do you want to go clean?

10:16.120 --> 10:18.160
Yes. Darrell...

10:22.680 --> 10:24.120
You keep looking here.

10:24.120 --> 10:26.160
I'll run back to the dorm
quickly and tidy my bed.

10:26.160 --> 10:28.680
I told you, Gwen, Mam'zelle
said to stick together.

10:28.680 --> 10:31.160
She was cross before. Right.

10:31.160 --> 10:32.640
What about in there?

10:32.640 --> 10:34.680
Maybe your coin rolled in.

10:34.680 --> 10:36.120
I don't see how.

10:36.120 --> 10:38.160
We have to be very thorough.

10:40.480 --> 10:41.960
No, no sign.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.280
How about behind the door?

10:51.600 --> 10:52.880
Gwen.

10:54.520 --> 10:55.920
I think the door's locked.

10:55.920 --> 10:58.320
Oh, gosh. Sorry. Don't worry.

10:58.320 --> 11:00.400
Sally and Darrell have a key.

11:00.400 --> 11:03.000
You sit tight.
I'll be back in a jiffy.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.040
Gwen.

11:04.040 --> 11:06.240
SHE SHAKES AND BANGS DOOR

11:04.040 --> 11:06.240
Gwen.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.120
MARY-LOU: Hello.

12:07.440 --> 12:09.600
THEY LAUGH AND SCREAM

12:15.520 --> 12:17.120
I wish we could do this every day.

12:17.120 --> 12:19.480
Imagine Matron's face.

12:19.480 --> 12:21.120
What are you doing?

12:21.120 --> 12:22.880
Making hard work fun.

12:22.880 --> 12:24.720
Where's that key?

12:24.720 --> 12:27.040
He won't believe it,
but Mary-Lou's locked herself

12:27.040 --> 12:29.040
in Mam'zelle's cupboard.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.920
Poor Mary-Lou,
she must be so scared.

12:30.920 --> 12:32.960
Here.

12:30.920 --> 12:32.960
KEY CLANGS ON GROUND

12:32.960 --> 12:34.240
Darrell Rivers.

12:34.240 --> 12:35.640
Now look what you've done.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.080
It's fallen into the grate.

12:37.080 --> 12:38.840
Why would you throw it, Darrell?

12:38.840 --> 12:41.440
We're not going to be able
to get it back now.

12:41.440 --> 12:42.480
Oh.

12:44.880 --> 12:46.040
Oh, dear.

12:47.320 --> 12:49.680
Argh! I'm going
to check on Mary-Lou.

12:49.680 --> 12:50.960
Just find that key.

12:52.680 --> 12:55.560
MARY-LOU SINGS SADLY

12:57.800 --> 13:00.120
# Four and twenty
blackbirds baked in a pie

13:01.720 --> 13:04.200
# When the pie was open,
the birds began to... #

13:04.200 --> 13:05.680
Is anyone there?

13:05.680 --> 13:09.200
Yes, me, a bit of a mishap.

13:10.640 --> 13:12.920
The key fell down a
crack in the floor.

13:12.920 --> 13:14.320
They're getting it out now.

13:15.360 --> 13:18.400
If I hadn't lost my lucky coin,
this wouldn't have happened.

13:19.560 --> 13:21.480
It's my grandfather's.

13:21.480 --> 13:23.680
I wish I could show it to you.

13:23.680 --> 13:26.520
He was in the trenches in the
Great War, and well, that coin,

13:26.520 --> 13:28.200
it literally saved him.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.640
How did it do that?

13:31.520 --> 13:33.440
A bullet hit him,

13:33.440 --> 13:35.600
but the coin was in his pocket

13:35.600 --> 13:37.320
and it slowed it down.

13:43.480 --> 13:45.560
He said it would keep me safe, too.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.440
Are you crying?

13:51.800 --> 13:53.600
How am I going to tell my
grandmother?

13:53.600 --> 13:55.080
She will be so upset.

13:58.960 --> 14:00.720
Do try and buck up.

14:00.720 --> 14:02.600
It's OK, I'm going to
get you out soon.

14:02.600 --> 14:03.640
I promise.

14:07.040 --> 14:09.600
# The king was
in his counting house

14:09.600 --> 14:11.320
# Counting out his money

14:11.320 --> 14:12.360
# The queen was in... #

14:25.280 --> 14:28.520
Mam'zelle will explode when she
finds we've lost the key.

14:28.520 --> 14:30.400
Sorry, no joy yet.

14:30.400 --> 14:31.640
Well, please hurry.

14:31.640 --> 14:32.680
Mary-Lou's so upset.

14:32.680 --> 14:34.480
I've tried to calm her down.

14:34.480 --> 14:36.160
Oh, well, should we tell someone?

14:36.160 --> 14:37.600
No, no, I've got it.

14:39.520 --> 14:42.680
Gently does it.
I thought I'd got it three times.

14:42.680 --> 14:44.080
Come on.

14:45.080 --> 14:46.440
Ah!

14:46.440 --> 14:48.280
SHE GASPS

14:48.280 --> 14:49.640
Finally.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.800
What's that?

14:51.800 --> 14:53.040
Got it, Mary-Lou.

14:53.040 --> 14:54.600
Sally, it's...it's a ring.

14:56.040 --> 14:57.240
Gosh, it's real.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.840
Could it be...Lady Jane Mallory's?

15:06.200 --> 15:08.960
MARY-LOU SOBS

15:08.960 --> 15:10.800
I'm here, I have the key.

15:14.040 --> 15:16.680
I thought I'd be stuck
in there forever.

15:16.680 --> 15:18.680
Here, I haven't used it.

15:22.040 --> 15:24.320
Look what I found.

15:24.320 --> 15:25.960
Gwen.

15:25.960 --> 15:27.240
Where was it?

15:27.240 --> 15:29.280
It was on the floor outside.

15:30.360 --> 15:32.280
Thank you. Thank you so much.

15:37.760 --> 15:39.640
You're my best friend.

15:39.640 --> 15:41.080
Thank you.

15:42.200 --> 15:43.800
Oh, thank you so much.

15:55.960 --> 15:58.160
SHE CHUCKLES

15:59.800 --> 16:01.400
KNOCK AT DOOR

16:03.000 --> 16:04.280
Come in.

16:04.280 --> 16:07.080
Miss Grayling, you won't believe
what we found under the grate.

16:07.080 --> 16:08.880
Under the grate?
It's a long story.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.400
Oh, it's old. We think it might be
part of the treasure.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.840
Goodness.

16:13.840 --> 16:16.640
I do recall mention of a ring
just like this.

16:17.920 --> 16:19.760
There's an inventory.

16:19.760 --> 16:22.120
Lady Jane wrote it in her diary.

16:27.800 --> 16:31.640
Yes, there it is,
"A ruby ring in white gold."

16:31.640 --> 16:33.840
This is a wonderful
discovery, girls.

16:33.840 --> 16:36.760
Is there more? What if all her
treasure's buried beneath the floor?

16:36.760 --> 16:39.640
Oh, wait, there's a footnote.

16:39.640 --> 16:43.160
You see, the ring was given
to Annie Yates, housemaid.

16:44.880 --> 16:48.840
And if Annie dropped it, the rest
of the treasure won't be there.

16:48.840 --> 16:50.760
It's still an exciting find.

16:52.240 --> 16:53.800
Was it precious?

16:53.800 --> 16:56.280
I mean, worth-a-lot-of-money
precious?

16:56.280 --> 17:00.080
Well, sadly, one ring
won't be enough to save the school.

17:00.080 --> 17:01.840
We need all the treasure for that.

17:04.520 --> 17:06.040
I have an appointment in town.

17:06.040 --> 17:07.760
Would you put this back for me,

17:07.760 --> 17:10.320
then make sure to close the
door on your way out?

17:21.040 --> 17:23.080
Darrell, this picture,

17:23.080 --> 17:26.520
does it remind you of the poem,
the one Mr Parker put in his play?

17:26.520 --> 17:29.760
Oh, the poem, that should be
in the diary too.

17:29.760 --> 17:31.640
Isn't there something about a cross?

17:32.840 --> 17:34.400
Oh, found it!

17:34.400 --> 17:36.000
"I love you, my dearest..."

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
Oh! "..with all of my heart,
I bury our future,

17:39.000 --> 17:40.720
"as soon, we must part.

17:40.720 --> 17:43.080
"My Wealth, I'll abandon,
my father, I'll cross.

17:43.080 --> 17:45.880
"It's you that I win,
so I count it no loss."

17:45.880 --> 17:47.600
Darrell, look.

17:47.600 --> 17:50.360
The capital letters in the middle
of the sentences.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.640
Bury - Wealth - Cross.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.840
What if it's a clever clue?

17:54.840 --> 17:59.320
What if Lady Jane buried
her wealth next to a cross?

17:59.320 --> 18:02.160
I don't remember seeing
a cross on the cliffs.

18:02.160 --> 18:03.640
It's got to be there.

18:03.640 --> 18:04.680
Come on.

18:12.840 --> 18:14.600
Where's the fire?

18:14.600 --> 18:16.680
No fire, but there
might be treasure.

18:16.680 --> 18:19.240
Come with us, we might need
your help.

18:35.720 --> 18:38.080
You are great to have found this.

18:38.080 --> 18:40.680
Can you see where the
bullet went through?

18:40.680 --> 18:42.120
It saved his life.

18:47.200 --> 18:49.400
It's awful losing things.

18:49.400 --> 18:51.120
No wonder Irene was so wound up.

18:51.120 --> 18:53.200
That hair clip was her aunt's.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.920
And poor Georgina.

18:54.920 --> 18:57.120
That compact was from my godmother.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.560
Felicity's right,
someone's taking them.

19:02.560 --> 19:04.840
Who would do that?

19:04.840 --> 19:09.480
What do you think would happen
if they caught someone?

19:09.480 --> 19:12.440
They'd be expelled,
they'd have to be.

19:12.440 --> 19:14.560
Such an awful thing to do.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.760
I think I might be sick.

19:19.760 --> 19:21.400
Oh, oh, dear.

19:21.400 --> 19:23.720
Should I...should I fetch someone?

19:23.720 --> 19:25.880
Look. I'll just go and lie down.

19:25.880 --> 19:28.120
Mam'zelle won't mind if
this is done.

19:28.120 --> 19:30.200
These really are super, Mary-Lou.

19:30.200 --> 19:34.040
I should come with you. I mean, if
you feel sick. You finish up.

19:47.920 --> 19:50.000
Must be farther along.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.160
What are we looking for?
A stone cross.

19:52.160 --> 19:54.920
We found a drawing by Lady Jane
and we think she buried her treasure

19:54.920 --> 19:57.720
next to it. My grandad has a photo
of him and his brother

19:57.720 --> 19:59.280
by a stone cross.

19:59.280 --> 20:01.880
They used to walk to it
every Sunday.

20:01.880 --> 20:03.680
Where is it?

20:03.680 --> 20:04.880
It was right here.

20:04.880 --> 20:07.920
After the Great War,
there was a huge storm,

20:07.920 --> 20:09.520
half the cliff collapsed.

20:09.520 --> 20:11.400
I think it was lost then.

20:13.240 --> 20:14.840
I really thought we might find it.

20:14.840 --> 20:16.160
So did I.

20:37.400 --> 20:39.920
Compact, that's Georgina's.

20:39.920 --> 20:41.720
Pen, Alicia.

20:43.160 --> 20:45.560
You are going back home to Irene.

20:45.560 --> 20:47.480
FOOTSTEPS AND VOICES APPROACH

20:47.480 --> 20:50.440
Poor Gwen, she was working
so hard, and I think she was sick.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.520
Poor Gwendoline.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.960
..comme elle va maintenant
tres bien.

20:55.960 --> 20:59.880
Gwendoline, Mari-Lou told
me you were sick.

20:59.880 --> 21:02.120
The walk here cleared my mind.

21:02.120 --> 21:03.920
Are you OK, Mam'zelle?

21:03.920 --> 21:05.280
Of course.

21:06.680 --> 21:07.960
C'est merveilleux.

21:07.960 --> 21:10.280
You shall each have a merit mark.

21:10.280 --> 21:12.120
Now that floor.

21:12.120 --> 21:14.600
Allons-y, allons trouve et...

21:17.160 --> 21:18.200
Gwen.

21:24.320 --> 21:26.880
MAM'ZELLE: C'est incroyable,
such a shame.

21:26.880 --> 21:28.600
How did you manage it?

21:28.600 --> 21:31.240
Oh, um, it's hard to explain.

21:32.680 --> 21:36.440
Well, it is incredible.
An effort mark for you both.

21:36.440 --> 21:38.280
THEY LAUGH

21:38.280 --> 21:40.000
BUS BEEPS CLAXON

21:40.000 --> 21:41.960
They're back, let's go.

21:41.960 --> 21:43.560
What are they laughing at?

21:53.840 --> 21:57.920
SALLY: The castle sounds fun. It's
really was a bit spooky, though.

21:57.920 --> 22:00.560
I got locked in a cupboard,
that was really spooky.

22:00.560 --> 22:03.000
Gwen, what happened?
I can't believe you missed the bus.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.440
I can't believe we didn't
get our ices. That was my fault.

22:05.440 --> 22:07.640
Gwen only missed the bus
because of me.

22:07.640 --> 22:09.600
Darrell, I have a present for you.

22:12.280 --> 22:13.640
I love them.

22:17.280 --> 22:18.920
Toffees.

22:20.040 --> 22:24.440
It's lovely, um, but you can't
buy my friendship, Alicia.

22:24.440 --> 22:27.160
GIRLS CHATTER INDISTINCTLY

22:30.240 --> 22:32.200
Everyone.

22:32.200 --> 22:34.280
I know I'm not exactly
flavour of the month,

22:34.280 --> 22:38.000
but I have some big
news and you all need to hear it.

22:39.280 --> 22:41.560
Can't we do this later?
I'm starving.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.680
Go if you want, but this is huge.

22:44.680 --> 22:45.720
Gwen...

22:46.800 --> 22:49.200
..it's about the things
that have gone missing.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.640
What would I know about that?

22:51.640 --> 22:54.200
People being careless has
nothing to do with me.

22:54.200 --> 22:55.640
Except they're not careless.

22:55.640 --> 22:58.000
Someone's stealing. I have proof.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.720
What's it got to do with Gwen?

23:01.000 --> 23:03.560
I'm sorry to be the one
to bring this out in the open.

23:05.840 --> 23:07.200
We stopped at the village.

23:08.440 --> 23:11.280
Now, remember that brooch
your mother lost?

23:11.280 --> 23:13.640
It's in the jeweller's window.

23:13.640 --> 23:15.520
Well, how did it get there?

23:15.520 --> 23:17.280
Don't you see?

23:17.280 --> 23:20.360
Someone stole it and then brought
it to the jeweller's to sell.

23:21.600 --> 23:22.880
Oh, Gwen.

23:25.800 --> 23:27.560
Poor you, that's dreadful.

23:27.560 --> 23:28.800
Isn't it just?

23:30.080 --> 23:32.040
So there really is a thief?

23:37.320 --> 23:40.920
Don't worry, Gwen, I won't rest
till we've caught them.

23:46.560 --> 23:48.200
Come on, let's eat.

23:50.680 --> 23:52.880
Gosh, that's bad, isn't it?

23:52.880 --> 23:54.360
Tell me all about it.

23:54.360 --> 23:55.920
I'm really sorry, Gwen.
