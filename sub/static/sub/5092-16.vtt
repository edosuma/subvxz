WEBVTT

00:01.735 --> 00:04.305
Previously on Blue Bloods:
You're on your own
once you're at the location.

00:04.338 --> 00:06.540
Uh, Lieutenant,
so we're clear, um,

00:06.574 --> 00:08.142
I'm not committing
to a career undercover.

00:08.176 --> 00:09.143
Hey, I know you, right?

00:09.177 --> 00:10.478
Uh, I don't think so.

00:10.511 --> 00:13.047
Uh, yeah, yeah, I do.
Noble Sanfino.

00:13.081 --> 00:14.115
Jimmy Riordan.

00:14.148 --> 00:15.516
FRANK:
His father and his uncle

00:15.549 --> 00:16.750
are captains in the Cavazzere
crime family.

00:16.784 --> 00:18.786
Don't want what you can't have.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.122
It's my sister Bianca.

00:21.155 --> 00:22.356
Well, you talk a big game.

00:22.390 --> 00:24.292
Makes me wonder
what you really got.

00:24.325 --> 00:27.561
KRAMER:
Johnny Tesla. He's a made guy
in the Cavazzere family,

00:27.595 --> 00:30.131
and he's also a real badass.

00:30.164 --> 00:31.799
You need to get a thumb drive
into their system

00:31.832 --> 00:33.401
and download
any transaction activity.

00:33.434 --> 00:35.469
Hey, Riordan, wait up.

00:35.503 --> 00:37.371
I think you got something
that doesn't belong to you.

00:37.405 --> 00:41.542
(grunting)

00:48.649 --> 00:51.452
*

00:56.157 --> 00:59.260
How much did they give
to the foundation?

00:59.293 --> 01:00.761
Low six figures.

01:00.794 --> 01:02.796
I'll stay for drinks.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.865
The daily briefing
has you staying for dinner.

01:04.898 --> 01:09.237
But you're going to pull me out
at 8:30 with a crisis.

01:10.238 --> 01:11.139
I am?

01:11.172 --> 01:12.506
Yes.

01:12.540 --> 01:14.175
What if you're having
a good time and want to stay?

01:14.208 --> 01:17.445
Then we need to come up
with a code word for that.

01:17.478 --> 01:18.612
Goodwin.

01:18.646 --> 01:21.249
Tom Goodwin, the ballplayer?

01:21.282 --> 01:23.684
No, Doris Kearns Goodwin,
the writer.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.286
She won a Pulitzer.

01:26.687 --> 01:29.257
The only way I am staying
through one of these dinners

01:29.290 --> 01:32.226
is if I'm seated next to
Doris Kearns Goodwin.

01:32.260 --> 01:34.795
I'll talk to you at 8:30.

01:35.796 --> 01:37.765
(door opens)

01:37.798 --> 01:39.800
(door closes)

01:42.936 --> 01:49.443
(cell phone ringing)

01:53.447 --> 01:55.216
Jimmy Riordan. Who's this?

01:55.249 --> 01:57.218
Jimmy, it's Bianca.

01:57.251 --> 01:59.353
Bianca?

01:59.387 --> 02:00.854
Sanfino.

02:00.888 --> 02:02.190
I know.

02:02.223 --> 02:03.557
I need to see you.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.526
Look, Bianca, I told you,

02:05.559 --> 02:07.295
I can't be getting into anything
else with you, okay?

02:07.328 --> 02:08.862
They killed Johnny Tesla.

02:10.298 --> 02:11.732
Who did?

02:11.765 --> 02:13.367
No, no, not on the phone.

02:13.401 --> 02:14.902
You gotta come up.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.939
I can't get anywhere
for a couple hours at least.

02:18.972 --> 02:22.476
I'm at the Winslet in Tribeca,
room 1202.

02:22.510 --> 02:24.745
Don't tell anyone I'm here.

02:32.686 --> 02:34.355
Lieutenant Arbogast.

02:40.494 --> 02:41.462
Frank.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.564
Joan.
Ah.

02:45.333 --> 02:46.734
JOAN:
You made it.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.469
FRANK:
Wouldn't miss it.

02:48.502 --> 02:51.205
Thanks again for your generosity
to the foundation.

02:51.239 --> 02:52.540
Just point me
where you want me.

02:52.573 --> 02:56.377
(chuckles)
Well, I've seated you
between the Dean of Faculty

02:56.410 --> 02:58.579
at Sarah Lawrence and the
editrix of Allure.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.448
But first...

03:00.481 --> 03:03.251
Joan, would you excuse me.

03:03.284 --> 03:05.953
Just a second.
Mm-hmm.

03:09.390 --> 03:12.926
(cell phone buzzing)

03:12.960 --> 03:14.295
Frank, you just got there.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.264
Goodwin.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.599
Wow, what are the chances
of that.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.501
Yeah, who would have thought.

03:26.274 --> 03:27.341
I'm sorry.

03:27.375 --> 03:29.443
Where were we?
Well...

03:29.477 --> 03:32.380
There's Melanie Maines.
Do you watch her?

03:32.413 --> 03:36.284
Oh, I caught a recent piece,
some indignant expose.

03:36.317 --> 03:38.319
Couldn't walk
straight for days.

03:38.352 --> 03:39.420
What do you mean?

03:39.453 --> 03:41.355
Kept leaning to the left.

03:41.389 --> 03:45.393
(laughs)
Oh, Frank, you're terrible.

03:45.426 --> 03:47.027
Melanie.
Yes.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.297
Meet our police commissioner,
Frank Reagan.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.264
Frank.

03:50.298 --> 03:51.732
Call me Commissioner.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.701
(chuckles)
You behave.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.703
Hi.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.405
Hi.

03:57.438 --> 03:59.473
You're in town but
I didn't get the memo.

03:59.507 --> 04:01.842
I'm just here for a minute.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.744
Maybe you got a steady fella?

04:03.777 --> 04:06.480
Oh, I can't get
anything past you, can I?

04:06.514 --> 04:08.048
But that's not it,
or you would have

04:08.081 --> 04:10.284
sent me one of those
long insomniac e-mails.

04:10.318 --> 04:11.852
(sighs)

04:11.885 --> 04:12.953
May I get you a drink, sir?

04:12.986 --> 04:15.423
Yes, you can get him
a single malt,

04:15.456 --> 04:17.958
neat, in a chilled rocks glass.

04:17.991 --> 04:19.427
Very good.

04:23.063 --> 04:26.300
JAMIE:
No, that's all Bianca said--
"they" killed Johnny Tesla."

04:26.334 --> 04:28.369
Yeah, we don't
have that.

04:28.402 --> 04:29.803
We don't have what?

04:29.837 --> 04:33.040
Anything, a body,
chatter on the wires, nothing.

04:33.073 --> 04:34.408
She say when?

04:34.442 --> 04:35.409
No, just that
they killed him.

04:35.443 --> 04:37.478
ARBOGAST:
Johnny Tesla...

04:37.511 --> 04:40.648
was a made guy
with the Cavazzeres.

04:40.681 --> 04:42.416
The Cavazzeres
and the Sanfinos have had

04:42.450 --> 04:44.918
a peace treaty
for almost, uh, 20 years now.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.555
But if some Sanfino
whacked Johnny Tesla,

04:47.588 --> 04:49.056
boom, there goes
the Treaty of Glen Cove.

04:49.089 --> 04:51.091
Could somebody be trying
to set me up for it?

04:51.124 --> 04:52.460
Why you?

04:52.493 --> 04:54.528
Because I had a beef with him.

04:54.562 --> 04:56.497
Kicked my ass into next year
just a couple months ago.

04:56.530 --> 04:58.332
So you killed him?

04:58.366 --> 05:00.468
Who are you,
Joe Pesci in Goodfellas?

05:00.501 --> 05:03.837
No, but they can make
anything they want out of me.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.773
Jimmy Riordan doesn't exist,

05:05.806 --> 05:07.375
doesn't have a job
or a home address.

05:07.408 --> 05:08.409
If they need me
for something,

05:08.442 --> 05:10.678
if they want me for something,

05:10.711 --> 05:12.480
how are they going to find me?

05:14.915 --> 05:17.084
Noble, or his sister.

05:17.117 --> 05:20.521
Exactly. Can you tell me what
the hell is going on here?

05:20.554 --> 05:22.456
So, you're here on a story?

05:22.490 --> 05:23.991
How's your family?

05:24.024 --> 05:26.093
All good, thanks.
What's the story?

05:26.126 --> 05:27.595
You don't want to know.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.730
Which makes me think
I do want to know.

05:29.763 --> 05:32.900
Can you take the badge off
for the evening?

05:32.933 --> 05:34.902
For starters, it's
called a shield,

05:34.935 --> 05:37.405
and I don't wear one,
just a lapel pin.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.873
Can you?

05:39.907 --> 05:43.477
You look great.
(chuckles)

05:43.511 --> 05:45.579
Not too shabby yourself.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.650
JOAN:
Everybody, dinner is served.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.788
You hungry,
Commissioner?

05:56.457 --> 05:57.791
All right.

05:57.825 --> 05:59.092
Okay.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.661
We're gonna have a
ghost in the lobby

06:00.694 --> 06:02.496
and another one on her floor,
posing as maintenance,

06:02.530 --> 06:04.632
to make sure it's
just her in the room.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.166
Stop by tech
on your way out,

06:06.199 --> 06:08.168
they'll switch your undercover
phone over to a transmitter.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.403
Like, wire me?

06:09.437 --> 06:11.472
No wires, just a cell phone

06:11.505 --> 06:12.540
they can program to your number

06:12.573 --> 06:14.575
and can keep tabs on you
and record what she says.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.145
Get her to tell you
who killed Johnny Tesla,

06:18.178 --> 06:19.913
find out who "they" is.

06:19.947 --> 06:22.516
Look, when I got the files from
their boiler room operation,

06:22.550 --> 06:23.851
I thought you had
enough to nail 'em.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.085
For racketeering, maybe.

06:25.118 --> 06:27.655
But If we can tie
Phil Sanfino to a murder,

06:27.688 --> 06:30.591
that's not icing,
that's the cake.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.161
You good with this?

06:34.194 --> 06:36.764
Walk on the beach.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.200
How'd you ditch
your detail?

06:40.233 --> 06:42.536
That's confidential
police business.

06:42.570 --> 06:44.805
Morse code with
the window blinds?

06:44.838 --> 06:46.173
Boy, you're good.

06:46.206 --> 06:50.544
Oh, are we actually alone?

06:50.578 --> 06:53.547
That is a question
that requires a nightcap

06:53.581 --> 06:55.549
before I even consider
an answer.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.551
Done.

06:57.585 --> 07:00.554
There's a newspaper stand
on 77th Street.

07:00.588 --> 07:03.223
You want to go up, get us
the papers for the morning?

07:03.256 --> 07:06.594
Yes, ma'am.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.228
Frank?
Yeah?

07:08.261 --> 07:11.665
It's room
(whispers) 305.

07:11.699 --> 07:15.435
I'll be there.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.005
Frank?!
What?!

07:18.038 --> 07:19.607
The Times
and the Post.

07:20.741 --> 07:23.644
You got it.

07:33.654 --> 07:35.489
Stop! Police!

07:37.290 --> 07:41.895
(Melanie screaming)

07:46.033 --> 07:48.502
Get this off!
(panting)

07:48.536 --> 07:49.670
Aah!
You all right?

07:49.703 --> 07:51.605
I don't know!

07:51.639 --> 07:53.073
(screams)

08:26.840 --> 08:28.275
Checking in, sir?

08:28.308 --> 08:30.911
No, just visiting.
Cheers.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.200
(knocks)

08:53.233 --> 08:54.835
Bianca, it's Jimmy.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.108
What took you so long?

09:01.141 --> 09:02.576
What's with the gun?

09:02.610 --> 09:04.645
I got some
trust issues right now.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.179
Well, give it to me
or I'm out of here.

09:07.981 --> 09:10.017
Give it.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.053
There.

09:13.086 --> 09:14.254
Now close the damn door.

09:22.129 --> 09:24.665
We were at my cousin Daniella's
new kid's christening...

09:24.698 --> 09:26.333
You and Tesla?

09:26.366 --> 09:28.969
Yeah, me and Tesla.
You want a cocktail?
No, I'm good.

09:30.137 --> 09:31.672
Anyway, Johnny and me
are getting

09:31.705 --> 09:33.974
our cars at the same time
and he goes off on me.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.876
Not me really, but
Noble and Uncle Phil.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.111
You know, my side of the family.

09:38.145 --> 09:40.648
Says they accused him
of stealing something

09:40.681 --> 09:41.815
from work
and that he's innocent.

09:41.849 --> 09:44.084
Stolen like, skimmed?

09:44.117 --> 09:45.853
No, more complicated.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.054
The records or files
or something

09:47.087 --> 09:48.355
from their investments company.

09:50.691 --> 09:51.825
Then what?

09:51.859 --> 09:54.394
Then, Johnny goes even more off.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.096
He starts talking about how

09:56.129 --> 09:58.365
Uncle Phil is a liar
and a thief to his own people

09:58.398 --> 10:00.333
and shouldn't throw stones
in glass houses.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.870
And I'm like, huh?

10:02.903 --> 10:04.304
So, I go to him.
Uncle Phil?

10:04.337 --> 10:06.006
Yeah.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.307
He goes...

10:07.340 --> 10:10.043
forget about it. Nuts.

10:10.077 --> 10:12.813
Makes me tell him
who said such a thing.

10:12.846 --> 10:14.882
I say, Johnny--
I defend Johnny a little

10:14.915 --> 10:17.350
on account of I known him
my whole life--

10:17.384 --> 10:18.852
Phil goes even more nuts.

10:18.886 --> 10:20.788
I get the hell out of there.

10:21.789 --> 10:23.323
You give Tesla a heads up?

10:23.356 --> 10:25.025
I couldn't reach him.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.860
Go to his house, nothing.

10:26.894 --> 10:29.229
The car's there,
the dogs inside,

10:29.262 --> 10:31.264
messing all over,
no Johnny.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.900
What do you want from me here?

10:32.933 --> 10:34.735
You know where they put him.

10:34.768 --> 10:35.602
Put Tesla?

10:35.635 --> 10:38.305
I saw what he did to you,
remember?

10:38.338 --> 10:40.908
Tried to blame whatever he was
doing at the shop on you.

10:40.941 --> 10:42.042
Beat you up for show.

10:42.075 --> 10:44.011
At least that's what
my Uncle Phil thinks.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.213
No.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.348
Look, I'm not saying
you had a hand in it,

10:48.381 --> 10:49.950
but you know something;
I know you do.

10:50.918 --> 10:52.786
I just want to know...

10:52.820 --> 10:56.957
I had a history with this guy,
like, my whole life.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.092
We had our bumps
along the way but, hey...

10:59.126 --> 11:02.329
I don't know anything.
I swear it.

11:02.362 --> 11:04.698
I know my brother
and Uncle Phil.

11:04.732 --> 11:05.966
Something went down on Johnny,

11:05.999 --> 11:07.868
they'd have gift-wrapped it
for you, you know,

11:07.901 --> 11:09.002
here's the payback.

11:09.036 --> 11:11.304
Didn't happen.

11:14.808 --> 11:19.046
I am an investigative reporter
who specializes in stories

11:19.079 --> 11:21.281
on financial
and political corruption.

11:21.314 --> 11:24.417
I have angered a lot
of people with my work.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.887
I wouldn't know how
to start ranking them.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.021
You're working
on a story.

11:28.055 --> 11:30.357
Who would be threatened by
what you're digging into?

11:30.390 --> 11:34.427
Nobody that would try to scare
me off with acid to my face.

11:34.461 --> 11:36.797
Well, suppose you let me be
the judge of that.

11:38.766 --> 11:42.069
Suppose the subject
of my interview

11:42.102 --> 11:44.137
may or may not be a person
of interest to NYPD.

11:44.171 --> 11:47.975
I don't know where he is.

11:48.008 --> 11:50.744
He gets in contact
his own way and time.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.915
That would be
what we'd call a pickle.

11:54.948 --> 11:57.918
Who doesn't want him
to talk to you?

11:59.019 --> 12:00.988
The people that are
the subject

12:01.021 --> 12:02.956
of the piece
I'm doing.

12:02.990 --> 12:06.827
Okay, are they bigger
than a bread box?

12:06.860 --> 12:08.461
Come on, Melanie, help us here.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.299
Detective...

12:12.332 --> 12:15.969
in the safe in the closet
there is a Walther PPK

12:16.003 --> 12:17.470
that I am licensed
to carry in 48 states,

12:17.504 --> 12:19.840
including this one.

12:19.873 --> 12:23.443
I will not leave this hotel
without that gun in my purse

12:23.476 --> 12:25.012
for the rest of my stay.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.114
Wow, case closed.

12:28.148 --> 12:31.051
Oh, Frank.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.520
I'm not trying to be cavalier...

12:33.553 --> 12:36.023
but I am not going
to give up my source.

12:38.125 --> 12:42.495
How about stalkers,
threatening mail?

12:44.097 --> 12:49.036
My producer keeps a file on all
the cranks and the, the creeps.

12:49.069 --> 12:52.906
It's up to date and he will
give you all of that.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.909
Thanks.

12:57.344 --> 12:59.146
Guys, it is very late.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.214
It's 5:00 in the morning
where I woke up,

13:01.248 --> 13:03.250
so I've had a long night.

13:07.154 --> 13:09.156
You know I can't stay.

13:13.193 --> 13:15.829
Well, I'll just take a pill

13:15.863 --> 13:17.965
and try to sleep
for a couple hours.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.599
I'll call you
when I wake up.

13:19.632 --> 13:22.069
Good night.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.006
This is my cell phone number--
it's always on.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.007
You got it.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.442
Thanks, Detective.
Sir.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.011
(sighs)
Drop me home?

13:31.044 --> 13:31.979
Sure.

13:32.012 --> 13:34.081
Sorry to wake you,
thanks for coming down.

13:34.114 --> 13:35.515
No problem.

13:35.548 --> 13:36.984
(presses button)
We see each other

13:37.017 --> 13:38.952
a few times a year,
when she's in town.

13:39.987 --> 13:42.022
Okay.

13:42.055 --> 13:45.158
We met at a dinner
year before last.

13:45.192 --> 13:48.395
She lives in Atlanta, spends
most of her time on the road.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.363
We both like to keep
the friendship quiet.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.434
(presses button)

13:54.467 --> 13:57.170
This relevant to
the case at all?

13:57.204 --> 13:59.006
No, but I thought
you might have questions.

13:59.039 --> 14:02.242
Right, well, you know
that thing that kids have

14:02.275 --> 14:03.877
about their
parents' sex lives?

14:03.911 --> 14:07.347
It, uh, kind of never
really goes away, Dad.

14:07.380 --> 14:10.150
Who said anything
about sex?

14:12.185 --> 14:14.454
Right.

14:18.658 --> 14:20.593
Beautiful woman.

14:20.627 --> 14:23.296
Yes, she is.

14:23.330 --> 14:24.297
(elevator bell dings)

14:24.331 --> 14:25.632
After you, Romeo.

14:31.404 --> 14:32.906
Please stay.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.142
I don't want to be alone
tonight.

14:35.175 --> 14:36.676
I can't.
Why not?

14:36.709 --> 14:39.079
You thought I had something
to do with Tesla disappearing.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.647
So?
So who else might?

14:40.680 --> 14:42.249
Okay, I got to lay low,

14:42.282 --> 14:44.184
and staying here with you
ain't exactly laying low.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.485
You know, you may
never see me again.

14:45.518 --> 14:46.386
What do you think
about that?

14:46.419 --> 14:48.255
I think you're being
a little overdramatic.

14:48.288 --> 14:49.422
What the hell do you know?

14:52.259 --> 14:53.493
Bianca, I got to go.

14:53.526 --> 14:55.028
Then give me back my gun.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.098
Give it.

15:04.704 --> 15:07.207
Get some sleep.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.285
Is that it for
tonight, sir?

15:18.318 --> 15:19.286
Yeah, good night.

15:19.319 --> 15:21.321
Cheers.

15:28.461 --> 15:32.265
Yeah, yeah,
it's Mike from the Winslet.

15:37.004 --> 15:38.972
But most of the
threatening stuff we get

15:39.006 --> 15:40.207
tracks back
to the two demos

15:40.240 --> 15:42.209
with too much TV time
on their hands--

15:42.242 --> 15:45.278
convicts in prison, retirees
in the warmer climates.

15:45.312 --> 15:48.148
Not that we don't appreciate
their loyal viewership.

15:48.181 --> 15:49.149
(laughs)

15:49.182 --> 15:50.317
All right, what kind
of threats?

15:50.350 --> 15:52.619
Mostly of a sexual nature.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.554
I mean, some of the bigger
wing nuts have suggested

15:54.587 --> 15:56.089
ways they'd like
to see her die,

15:56.123 --> 15:58.325
but it's hard
to take 'em seriously,

15:58.358 --> 16:00.293
given their
logistical challenges.

16:00.327 --> 16:01.728
Anyone ever threaten
disfigurement?

16:01.761 --> 16:03.363
Nah.

16:04.697 --> 16:06.299
No.

16:06.333 --> 16:09.569
Okay, if you were looking
for a headline here...

16:09.602 --> 16:12.305
I've flagged five
of these pen pals

16:12.339 --> 16:14.241
whose e-mail correspondence
our security guys

16:14.274 --> 16:17.010
have tracked back
to the New York metro area.

16:17.044 --> 16:19.279
A couple of 'em had an uptick
in volume the last couple

16:19.312 --> 16:21.314
of weeks-- these two.

16:23.150 --> 16:27.354
All right, Murrow, and let's see
what DoubleWhiskey44 has to say.

16:27.387 --> 16:29.322
JAMIE:
You ever hear
of the butterfly effect?

16:29.356 --> 16:30.323
No.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.359
Based on the
theoretical example

16:32.392 --> 16:34.227
of a hurricane's formation being
contingent upon whether or not

16:34.261 --> 16:35.528
a butterfly had flapped
its wings

16:35.562 --> 16:37.730
several weeks before?

16:37.764 --> 16:39.499
Harvard was closed
the day I dropped by.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.470
Several weeks

16:43.503 --> 16:45.038
after I make off
with files

16:45.072 --> 16:46.439
from the Sanfinos'
phony stock operation,

16:46.473 --> 16:48.508
Johnny Tesla gets blamed for it
and ends up dead.

16:48.541 --> 16:51.144
And you're what,
sentimental about this?

16:51.178 --> 16:52.645
His blood's on my hands.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.347
A) we don't know for
certain that he's dead,

16:54.381 --> 16:56.316
and B) when he handed
you that beatdown,

16:56.349 --> 16:58.385
you think he gave it
a second thought?
(phone rings)

16:58.418 --> 17:00.487
Speak to me.

17:01.488 --> 17:02.789
N... he's right here.

17:04.257 --> 17:07.327
You got all this
off the wiretaps?

17:07.360 --> 17:10.497
Oh, great, okay.

17:10.530 --> 17:13.366
I'll let him know.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.136
The sister disappeared from
the hotel soon after you left.

17:16.169 --> 17:17.270
She's gone
off the grid.

17:17.304 --> 17:18.405
Do we know what happened?

17:18.438 --> 17:19.406
No, we don't,

17:19.439 --> 17:20.340
but more importantly,

17:20.373 --> 17:22.209
neither does Uncle
Philly or the family,

17:22.242 --> 17:26.546
and, uh... they're looking
for Jimmy Riordan for answers.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.318
To the tune of 18 missed calls

17:31.351 --> 17:33.153
from Noble.
You want to keep that on?

17:33.186 --> 17:34.387
How do they know
that I was with her?

17:34.421 --> 17:35.722
Somebody knows
the hotel's doorman

17:35.755 --> 17:37.757
and he gave them
your description.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.730
(sighs)

17:47.567 --> 17:49.569
(phone ringing)

17:51.371 --> 17:53.340
Riordan.

17:53.373 --> 17:56.676
The Nassau PD just found remains
matching Tesla's description

17:56.709 --> 17:58.111
in a Dumpster

17:58.145 --> 18:01.348
in back of a restaurant
in Great Neck.

18:01.381 --> 18:03.816
My friend's here, I got to go.

18:07.720 --> 18:08.688
Hey.
Hey, Noble.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.257
What did I tell you, huh?

18:10.290 --> 18:11.391
What did I tell you?

18:11.424 --> 18:12.225
Who died and
made you Dad?

18:12.259 --> 18:14.394
Look, I said you want
to make a move,

18:14.427 --> 18:15.362
you check with me first.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.364
I'm the guy
with the map, right?

18:17.397 --> 18:19.532
(panting)

18:19.566 --> 18:21.734
(laughing):
Look, come here, man.

18:22.735 --> 18:23.503
You're wasted, man.

18:23.536 --> 18:25.138
I thought you weren't
using anymore.

18:25.172 --> 18:28.275
I'm not using anymore.

18:28.308 --> 18:32.545
(laughing):
I'm not using any less,
though, either, right?

18:32.579 --> 18:35.348
Come here.

18:35.382 --> 18:37.350
All right.

18:37.384 --> 18:40.220
Where's Bianca?

18:40.253 --> 18:41.321
I don't know.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.623
No, no, no, no, no, let's get
something straight here.

18:43.656 --> 18:45.692
You want to tell me everything
that you know, okay?

18:45.725 --> 18:47.427
You don't want to cut out
the middleman here--

18:47.460 --> 18:48.595
that would be me--
because...

18:48.628 --> 18:50.563
I'm telling you
that I don't know...
Okay, no, listen.

18:50.597 --> 18:53.333
Because if they don't like
what I bring them,

18:53.366 --> 18:54.934
they're going to want
to talk to you directly,

18:54.967 --> 18:57.337
and, trust me here,
you don't want that.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.439
You know
Uncle Phil?

18:59.472 --> 19:01.741
Yeah, his favorite
expression--

19:01.774 --> 19:03.476
let's peel back the onion.

19:03.510 --> 19:04.611
I don't know where
she is, Noble.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.346
Okay, but you saw her
last night, right?

19:06.379 --> 19:08.881
Yeah.
Okay, so let's start

19:08.915 --> 19:10.917
with who called who.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.688
DANNY:
DoubleWhiskey44 is a wash.

19:15.722 --> 19:18.825
We traced the other e-mail
to an IP address here. Jack?

19:18.858 --> 19:21.828
Do you know, uh,
your patrons' screen names?

19:21.861 --> 19:23.630
I know some of 'em.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.199
Uh, that's
Surfer Grrrl.

19:27.634 --> 19:30.203
Uh, that's Nevermind.

19:31.538 --> 19:34.341
Yeah, well, we're looking
for an Edward R. Murrow.

19:34.374 --> 19:37.277
I don't want to tell
you your business,

19:37.310 --> 19:40.513
but that could be
somebody's like, real name.

19:42.582 --> 19:45.652
It was somebody's real name--
famous news correspondent,

19:45.685 --> 19:47.854
black and white TV,
always had a cigarette?

19:47.887 --> 19:50.223
That sounds like what
Smiles has for wallpaper.

19:50.257 --> 19:51.858
Who's Smiles?
His name's Miles.

19:51.891 --> 19:54.794
We call him Smiles
'cause he never does.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.729
He's usually in that
corner over there

19:56.763 --> 19:59.532
or out having
a smoke.

19:59.566 --> 20:00.800
Wait a minute.

20:00.833 --> 20:03.570
Is that him outside
having a smoke now?

20:03.603 --> 20:05.372
Yeah.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.607
DANNY:
Well, he left his computer.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.609
Keep an eye on him, Jack.

20:12.612 --> 20:13.780
What do you know?

20:14.714 --> 20:17.584
Edward R. Murrow.

20:17.617 --> 20:19.686
Oh, look at that.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.688
Hey, hey, get away from there.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.856
Sir, uh, we're
detectives.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.392
We just want to ask
you some questions.

20:25.425 --> 20:26.559
I've got a question
for you, Detective.

20:26.593 --> 20:29.596
You got a warrant
to search my computer?

20:29.629 --> 20:32.432
I wasn't searching your
computer; it was open.

20:32.465 --> 20:35.568
People, anybody see
this cop on my computer?

20:35.602 --> 20:36.569
Do you mind?

20:36.603 --> 20:37.570
I'm on a deadline.

20:37.604 --> 20:40.006
See?

20:40.039 --> 20:42.775
If it had been open
to an e-mail or a document,

20:42.809 --> 20:45.445
I'd have no expectation
of privacy under the law,

20:45.478 --> 20:46.913
but it wasn't.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.047
I know my rights,
Detective.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.283
Melanie Maines says hello.

20:52.018 --> 20:54.521
That's your second lie
in two sentences.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.458
Sir, sir, we just
want to talk to you.

20:58.491 --> 21:00.527
Detective, do you want
to tell your partner there

21:00.560 --> 21:01.794
he's out of bounds?

21:01.828 --> 21:04.331
Listen, listen, why don't you
let me buy you a pack of smokes

21:04.364 --> 21:05.498
and we'll, we'll start
from scratch, all right?

21:05.532 --> 21:06.799
No, no, I know my rights.

21:06.833 --> 21:08.635
Come on.
I'm walking
and you can't stop me.

21:08.668 --> 21:10.903
Okay, Danny, the last thing
your father's going to want

21:10.937 --> 21:12.805
is for you to go
off book on this.

21:12.839 --> 21:13.773
I mean, he knows
his rights.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.475
I know.

21:15.508 --> 21:18.010
I hate when
that happens.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.979
Whoa, whoa, I say
when we're finished here.

21:20.012 --> 21:22.315
No, as it turns out,
you don't, Noble.

21:22.349 --> 21:23.383
You've given me nothing here.

21:23.416 --> 21:25.752
I've give... What the hell
am I supposed to give you?

21:25.785 --> 21:27.687
Where's Tesla?
What happened?

21:27.720 --> 21:29.589
Who cares where he is?

21:29.622 --> 21:30.457
Him and I had a beef, okay?

21:30.490 --> 21:31.558
People know about it,
he's missing,

21:31.591 --> 21:33.393
I want to know what's what.

21:33.426 --> 21:35.094
What you don't know
can't hurt you.
Hey, I'm freezing

21:35.127 --> 21:36.729
my ass off out here
and I've told you everything.

21:36.763 --> 21:37.730
I'll see you.

21:37.764 --> 21:39.065
Yeah, except where my sister is.

21:39.098 --> 21:41.601
Get it through your thick
head-- I don't know!

21:41.634 --> 21:42.802
Okay, then, prove it.
How?

21:42.835 --> 21:44.003
Let me see your phone.

21:44.036 --> 21:46.038
(laughs)
Yeah.

21:46.072 --> 21:48.007
Man, let me see your phone,
let me see who you called.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.109
Here, come on, man,
give it to me, dude.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.745
Get the...

21:52.779 --> 21:53.880
You need help, man,

21:53.913 --> 21:55.682
but I'm not your guy,
not this time.

21:55.715 --> 21:58.585
You're the one who's going
to need help, Jimmy!

21:58.618 --> 22:02.021
Hey, don't you turn
your back on me, man!

22:02.054 --> 22:04.591
Shut the front door!

22:04.624 --> 22:06.025
No, it's true.

22:06.058 --> 22:08.728
I guess it's been going on
for a couple of years now.

22:08.761 --> 22:09.929
Apparently, she comes to town

22:09.962 --> 22:11.631
and they...
Melanie Maines, the reporter?

22:11.664 --> 22:13.032
Yeah, that's the one.

22:13.065 --> 22:14.701
Who else knows about this?

22:14.734 --> 22:17.570
You, me, Linda, uh, Jackie.

22:18.971 --> 22:21.474
That's all,
as far as I could tell.

22:21.508 --> 22:22.475
Dad?

22:22.509 --> 22:23.676
Yeah, Dad.

22:26.078 --> 22:28.047
Okay, well, good for him.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.682
Yeah, good for him.
But it'd be even better

22:29.716 --> 22:30.917
if you gave that warrant
that I asked for

22:30.950 --> 22:32.118
so I could try
to get some traction

22:32.151 --> 22:35.622
on Miles Drexler.
Well, with what
you have in hand, no.

22:35.655 --> 22:37.657
I know. But, look,
you've got to have at least

22:37.690 --> 22:39.426
one favor that you can call in.

22:39.459 --> 22:40.760
For Dad.

22:45.598 --> 22:47.567
You think it's serious?

22:47.600 --> 22:50.570
Somebody threw acid on her face;
it's got to be serious.

22:50.603 --> 22:52.405
Hi. It's Erin Reagan

22:52.439 --> 22:53.973
for Judge Higdon, please.

22:54.006 --> 22:56.409
That's not what
I'm talking about.

22:56.443 --> 22:58.545
I know what
you're talking about.

22:58.578 --> 23:01.013
You have a issue with this?

23:01.047 --> 23:04.116
I don't have an issue
with it. It...

23:04.150 --> 23:05.918
You're blushing!

23:05.952 --> 23:07.920
I'm not blushing!

23:07.954 --> 23:09.756
Yes, I'll hold.

23:09.789 --> 23:12.492
Thank you.
I can't believe you're blushing.

23:13.593 --> 23:14.894
(laughing)

23:14.927 --> 23:17.630
(sighs)

23:17.664 --> 23:19.632
DANNY:
Over here, Jack.

23:22.535 --> 23:25.505
This guy can even make seashells
look creepy.

23:25.538 --> 23:28.107
Look at this.

23:28.140 --> 23:30.577
Well, the bedroom's
right out of, uh,

23:30.610 --> 23:31.911
Better Homes and Bunkers.

23:31.944 --> 23:34.447
I can imagine.

23:34.481 --> 23:37.584
Let's see what we got here.

23:37.617 --> 23:39.218
(hissing)
Well...

23:39.251 --> 23:41.621
looks like somebody's definitely
been working with acid.

23:41.654 --> 23:43.556
Police!

23:43.590 --> 23:46.793
Don't move!
Whoa, okay, it's all right,
we're on the job.

23:46.826 --> 23:48.961
I'm Detective Reagan;
this is Detective Curatola.

23:48.995 --> 23:52.031
We have a warrant to
search this location right
here in my coat pocket.

23:52.064 --> 23:54.901
Show me your shield.

23:56.936 --> 23:58.771
What are you doing here?

23:58.805 --> 24:01.674
Hey, Smiles!

24:01.708 --> 24:05.478
You know, we went out and got
that warrant that you requested.

24:06.746 --> 24:07.647
What are you looking for?

24:07.680 --> 24:09.749
All right, time to
see yo shield.

24:09.782 --> 24:11.751
Officer Mercado, the 2-1.

24:11.784 --> 24:13.820
Miles?
Miles.

24:13.853 --> 24:15.021
AKA Edward R. Murrow.

24:15.054 --> 24:16.723
He's been sending
threatening e-mails

24:16.756 --> 24:18.958
to somebody who was attacked
with acid last night.

24:18.991 --> 24:20.727
I never threatened her.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.662
And I haven't written
her in months.

24:22.695 --> 24:24.631
Shut up. Miles.

24:24.664 --> 24:26.933
What time last night?

24:26.966 --> 24:27.934
Ten-thirty.

24:27.967 --> 24:29.969
He was with me,
right here.

24:30.002 --> 24:31.170
So you say.

24:31.203 --> 24:34.874
Not just me-- he got on one
of his call-in radio shows.

24:34.907 --> 24:36.809
Th... Which one again?

24:36.843 --> 24:38.811
Shawn Liberty. WBZM.

24:38.845 --> 24:41.180
I did a full five
minutes with Shawn

24:41.213 --> 24:43.516
about the Freedom
of Information Act.

24:43.550 --> 24:45.785
Could've called
from a mobile phone.

24:47.219 --> 24:48.988
But he did it
from the landline.

24:49.021 --> 24:50.823
Dump his phone; check
with the station.

24:50.857 --> 24:51.991
The show is live.

24:52.024 --> 24:54.527
You're detectives.
Go. Detect.

24:57.630 --> 24:59.766
FRANK (sighs):
I hear you, Danny.

24:59.799 --> 25:01.701
Let me know if
their story holds up.

25:01.734 --> 25:03.636
Be in touch.

25:03.670 --> 25:06.639
Sir, Melanie Maines is here.

25:07.674 --> 25:08.875
(sighs)

25:08.908 --> 25:10.176
Show her in.

25:10.209 --> 25:11.911
Do you want Garrett to join?

25:11.944 --> 25:13.980
No.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.815
Show her in, Baker.

25:18.217 --> 25:20.186
Ms. Maines.
Commissioner.

25:20.219 --> 25:21.120
Please sit down.

25:21.153 --> 25:23.790
Thank you.

25:23.823 --> 25:24.891
Thank you, Baker.

25:26.826 --> 25:29.095
(door closes)

25:29.128 --> 25:30.730
I don't have a lot of time,

25:30.763 --> 25:33.132
but I didn't want
to do this over the phone.

25:33.165 --> 25:35.835
Shall I dim the lights?

25:35.868 --> 25:37.837
(groans)
Ha-ha.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.839
Call your men off.

25:39.872 --> 25:40.840
They're for your protection.

25:40.873 --> 25:43.710
They are also
for your surveillance.

25:43.743 --> 25:46.345
I told you I wouldn't
interfere with your business.

25:46.378 --> 25:49.115
People who are any good
at evading the law develop

25:49.148 --> 25:51.050
a sense of when
the law is around.

25:51.083 --> 25:53.953
You will be interfering
with my business.

25:53.986 --> 25:57.123
You were attacked, and your
attacker is still at large.

25:57.156 --> 25:59.926
I have a gun;
I know how to use it.

25:59.959 --> 26:01.628
I can't do what you're asking.

26:01.661 --> 26:03.062
I swear I will not

26:03.095 --> 26:06.232
get there first or during
if the opportunity presents.

26:06.265 --> 26:08.868
(phone ringing)

26:08.901 --> 26:10.670
Excuse me.

26:12.839 --> 26:14.774
Yeah?

26:14.807 --> 26:17.644
Ah. One second.

26:17.677 --> 26:19.679
Um, hold on
a second.

26:23.015 --> 26:25.051
Go ahead.

26:27.153 --> 26:28.755
Got it.

26:29.956 --> 26:31.691
Don't ask.

26:31.724 --> 26:33.059
I won't.

26:33.092 --> 26:34.694
I got to go.

26:34.727 --> 26:36.295
Look at me.

26:37.930 --> 26:40.767
If you got hurt
on my watch in my city,

26:40.800 --> 26:42.902
I'd never forgive myself.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.371
I won't. But even if I did,

26:45.404 --> 26:47.674
it wouldn't be your fault.

26:47.707 --> 26:49.976
That wouldn't matter.

26:51.277 --> 26:53.379
I'm a big girl, Frank.

26:53.412 --> 26:55.047
It's why you like me.

26:58.050 --> 27:01.053
So treat me like one.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.828
(door closes)

27:08.861 --> 27:11.030
(sighs)

27:15.467 --> 27:17.303
(sighs)

27:19.105 --> 27:20.940
(smacks lips)

27:22.942 --> 27:24.944
(slams drawer)

27:29.148 --> 27:32.118
NOBLE (recorded):
Hey, don't you turn
your back on me, man!

27:32.151 --> 27:33.385
Sound quality's
amazing, isn't it?

27:33.419 --> 27:35.087
You know, they
got this new chip

27:35.121 --> 27:36.689
they put in there,
it's, like, the size of...

27:36.723 --> 27:38.157
I want out.

27:38.190 --> 27:39.158
You want out?

27:39.191 --> 27:40.993
Tesla's dead because of me.

27:42.829 --> 27:45.031
It's collateral damage.

27:45.064 --> 27:47.700
I didn't sign up to
get people killed here.

27:47.734 --> 27:51.070
(sighs)

27:51.103 --> 27:53.272
You know...
if you were anyone else,

27:53.305 --> 27:55.041
I'd tell you to quit bitching.

27:55.074 --> 27:56.976
But you're not--
you're the PC's son.

27:57.009 --> 27:58.711
So if you want to play
that card, go ahead.

27:58.745 --> 28:00.112
I'm not playing a card here!

28:00.146 --> 28:02.248
Oh, I know--
not just like that, but...

28:02.281 --> 28:04.383
we both know what
we're talking about.

28:04.416 --> 28:06.786
(phone ringing)

28:06.819 --> 28:09.221
What do you want from me!

28:09.255 --> 28:11.157
Well, my Uncle Phil wants
to talk to you himself,

28:11.190 --> 28:13.893
and you're coming in either way,
so make it easy on yourself--

28:13.926 --> 28:15.027
let me bring you in.

28:15.061 --> 28:17.029
I told you everything
I know, Noble.

28:17.063 --> 28:18.831
I'll meet you in
the same place in an hour.

28:26.105 --> 28:27.273
(door slams)

28:27.306 --> 28:29.208
Please pardon
the typing, Detective.

28:29.241 --> 28:30.943
Bane of my existence.

28:30.977 --> 28:31.844
It's fine.
(chuckles)

28:31.878 --> 28:33.445
We checked out all
metro area threats.

28:33.479 --> 28:35.748
One of them popped,
but he had a solid alibi.

28:35.782 --> 28:36.949
He's not our guy.

28:36.983 --> 28:38.084
Back to square one?

28:38.117 --> 28:39.886
Not exactly.
The thing is,

28:39.919 --> 28:41.287
the guy that popped,
this-this Murrow,

28:41.320 --> 28:43.189
he... he's very
likeable for this.

28:43.222 --> 28:46.225
The problem is, it seems like
he's so likeable for it,

28:46.258 --> 28:49.128
like somebody else knew
how likeable he was for it.

28:49.161 --> 28:50.496
Maybe someone
set him up.

28:50.529 --> 28:52.198
Somebody inside the network?

28:52.231 --> 28:55.201
How many people have access
to the security profiles?

28:55.234 --> 28:57.469
(sighs)
Counting the overseas bureau,

28:57.503 --> 28:59.238
probably a couple dozen.

28:59.271 --> 29:01.841
All right, look, that's a lot
of people in a lot of places.

29:01.874 --> 29:03.309
You think you can
narrow it down for me?

29:03.342 --> 29:04.410
How?

29:04.443 --> 29:05.878
Well, you were her gatekeeper

29:05.912 --> 29:07.046
for what, nine years?

29:07.079 --> 29:08.447
Yeah.
Okay, is there anyone

29:08.480 --> 29:10.016
in the orbits of work who

29:10.049 --> 29:11.317
might've had it in
for Ms. Maines?

29:11.350 --> 29:13.786
Look...

29:13.820 --> 29:15.421
I'm the exception.

29:15.454 --> 29:17.423
Now, we've had
a mutually beneficial

29:17.456 --> 29:19.926
and friendly relationship
ever since I came on with her.

29:19.959 --> 29:21.027
But there is

29:21.060 --> 29:23.195
a long list of people
she's fired,

29:23.229 --> 29:25.264
had fired, dumped on,
pissed off.

29:25.297 --> 29:27.867
I can get you that list,
no problem.

29:27.900 --> 29:30.169
But right now

29:30.202 --> 29:33.139
I have a meeting that
won't start without me.

29:33.172 --> 29:35.274
I'm on a cell phone
if you need me.
All right.

29:35.307 --> 29:36.342
I'll be in touch.
Thanks.

29:36.375 --> 29:38.878
Make sure you
get me that list.
You got it.

29:38.911 --> 29:40.546
(vehicle approaching)

29:45.417 --> 29:46.986
Come on. Get in.

29:47.019 --> 29:49.255
Where we going?

29:49.288 --> 29:51.357
We're going to meet my
uncle; I told you that.

29:51.390 --> 29:53.192
Get in.
No. Where?

29:53.225 --> 29:54.861
What the hell does it matter?

29:54.894 --> 29:56.395
'Cause I don't get
what's going on here.

29:56.428 --> 29:57.930
'Cause I want to know
where we're going

29:57.964 --> 29:59.866
to see if you're capable
of stating a true fact.

29:59.899 --> 30:02.534
His club in Brooklyn.

30:16.182 --> 30:17.984
DANNY:
Look, just humor me.

30:18.017 --> 30:20.386
All right? Let's say
I wanted to send e-mails

30:20.419 --> 30:21.387
looked like they came

30:21.420 --> 30:23.255
from one of your
customer's laptops.
Okay.

30:23.289 --> 30:25.291
Okay, how hard
would it be to hack into

30:25.324 --> 30:27.159
one of their accounts
in here from out there?

30:27.193 --> 30:29.528
20 bucks' worth
of spy-ware--
not hard at all.

30:29.561 --> 30:33.165
20 bucks?
I run a hot-spot cafe,
not the Pentagon.

30:33.199 --> 30:35.401
(phone ringing)

30:35.434 --> 30:36.402
What's all
this about?

30:36.435 --> 30:38.604
Hold on.
Yeah, Jack?

30:38.637 --> 30:41.407
They're picking up a suspect
in the attack on Melanie Maines.

30:41.440 --> 30:44.310
They got him off the
security camera at a sub shop

30:44.343 --> 30:46.445
on Lexington half hour before.

30:46.478 --> 30:48.915
Yeah, he fits the description,
and he's carrying

30:48.948 --> 30:51.017
the same container
that contained the acid.

30:51.050 --> 30:51.918
Where at?

30:51.951 --> 30:53.119
His girlfriend's apartment.

30:53.152 --> 30:55.387
It's, uh, 402 Humboldt
in Greenpoint.

30:55.421 --> 30:57.423
Okay. You ask 'em
to wait for me.

30:57.456 --> 30:58.925
Yeah.

30:58.958 --> 31:01.360
(rock music playing,
tires squealing)

31:05.197 --> 31:07.066
Questions about what?

31:07.099 --> 31:09.168
My sister,
for starters.

31:09.201 --> 31:10.436
I told you...
I think that

31:10.469 --> 31:13.339
they think that you're giving
off some sort of a cop scent.

31:13.372 --> 31:14.573
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

31:14.606 --> 31:16.508
What are you hiding, man?
Last chance.

31:16.542 --> 31:17.977
I'm not hiding anything.

31:18.010 --> 31:21.047
Are there cops
watching you for something?

31:21.080 --> 31:22.348
(rock music continues)

31:22.381 --> 31:24.083
No.

31:24.116 --> 31:26.352
You know, 'cause the doorman at
the hotel where you met Bianca,

31:26.385 --> 31:28.187
he seemed to think
that there were cops there

31:28.220 --> 31:29.421
and that they
were watching you.

31:36.195 --> 31:37.263
Whoa!

31:37.296 --> 31:39.131
(tires screech)

31:39.165 --> 31:40.366
(chuckles)

31:40.399 --> 31:43.936
Well, you're wound pretty tight
for a guy without a secret.

31:43.970 --> 31:46.973
Why don't you just
shut up and drive, man.

31:52.111 --> 31:53.712
Whoa. Oh, hold on,
hold on.

31:53.745 --> 31:57.483
Yeah, Detectives,
can I borrow him just
for a second, okay?

31:57.516 --> 31:59.518
Have you read him
his rights?

31:59.551 --> 32:02.388
All right.
Who hired you?
Who said I'm for hire, man?

32:02.421 --> 32:04.356
Come on, I know you didn't
plan this thing on your own.

32:04.390 --> 32:05.691
Who hired you?
Nobody hired me.

32:05.724 --> 32:07.493
Last shot
I cut you a break.

32:07.526 --> 32:08.594
Who hired you?
Okay, okay.

32:08.627 --> 32:09.661
Okay.

32:09.695 --> 32:10.862
Who hired you?
All right.

32:10.896 --> 32:13.632
She did a story on the TV
about my whole crew, all right?

32:13.665 --> 32:15.367
Made us look like a
bunch of little girls.

32:15.401 --> 32:17.469
That guy was, like,
her bitch, you know?

32:17.503 --> 32:19.538
Who are you talking about,
Craig Iverson?

32:19.571 --> 32:21.373
Her producer?
Yeah, him.

32:21.407 --> 32:24.076
And what break?
Come on.

32:24.110 --> 32:26.412
What break, man?
You'll get your break.
Shut up.

32:29.315 --> 32:30.349
Dad, it's me.

32:30.382 --> 32:32.184
Look, it was Iverson.

32:32.218 --> 32:34.086
Do you have a positive I.D.?

32:34.120 --> 32:36.188
No, not face to face-- they're
just bringing Alvarez down

32:36.222 --> 32:38.090
for processing now,
but, look, he did give up

32:38.124 --> 32:40.192
that they knew each other,
because Melanie did a piece

32:40.226 --> 32:41.427
with this guy's crew in it.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.095
JIM:
And how the hell
did that happen?

32:43.129 --> 32:44.530
Hold on a minute.

32:44.563 --> 32:46.032
Boss, our guys lost Ms. Maines.

32:46.065 --> 32:47.233
They went into a Starbucks

32:47.266 --> 32:48.434
on 86th,
then they must

32:48.467 --> 32:51.403
have gone out the back and had
another car waiting for them.

32:51.437 --> 32:53.539
Danny, we don't have them
in sight right now.

32:53.572 --> 32:54.540
I'll get back to you.

32:54.573 --> 32:56.508
(slams handset down)

32:56.542 --> 32:58.544
I know where she is.

33:08.387 --> 33:11.023
(rock music playing)

33:11.057 --> 33:13.192
Ah, shoot.

33:13.225 --> 33:14.526
(turns off music)
What?

33:14.560 --> 33:16.062
That's the place up ahead,

33:16.095 --> 33:18.530
and that is Bobby's Escalade
out front.

33:20.132 --> 33:20.666
What's that mean?

33:20.699 --> 33:22.468
Bobby's only there

33:22.501 --> 33:25.571
when Phil wants to conduct
the conversation someplace else.

33:25.604 --> 33:27.406
What the hell
are you talking about?

33:27.439 --> 33:29.007
You know, so he can peel
back the onion?

33:29.475 --> 33:30.576
So nobody can hear.

33:30.609 --> 33:31.710
Just keep driving then.

33:31.743 --> 33:33.379
No, no can do.

33:33.412 --> 33:35.147
Look, you just...
you just stay cool.

33:35.181 --> 33:36.082
I'll handle this, all right?

33:36.115 --> 33:37.483
I thought you
already handled it, Noble,

33:37.516 --> 33:39.085
that you were
bringing me in safe.

33:39.118 --> 33:41.220
Just shut up, okay?

33:52.831 --> 33:54.200
NOBLE:
Just stay cool,
all right?

33:57.503 --> 33:58.670
Hey.

33:58.704 --> 34:00.139
Thank you, Noble.

34:00.172 --> 34:02.108
I got it from here,
just go inside.

34:02.141 --> 34:04.110
Look, you asked me to bring
him in, you didn't say anything

34:04.143 --> 34:05.177
about Bobby being here.
I certainly didn't

34:05.211 --> 34:08.747
say anything about you telling
me my business, Noble.

34:08.780 --> 34:10.749
Phil, let's just talk
to him inside, okay?

34:10.782 --> 34:13.185
What the hell's going on--
first your sister and now you?

34:13.219 --> 34:15.087
Hey!

34:15.121 --> 34:17.323
If I want your opinion,
I'll ask you for it.

34:17.356 --> 34:18.657
Now get inside and wait.

34:18.690 --> 34:20.626
Come on, get him out of the car.

34:20.659 --> 34:22.161
All right, look,
all right, all right, all right.

34:22.194 --> 34:23.061
I got some things to say,

34:23.095 --> 34:25.364
but not like. Not like this.
Let's go.

34:25.397 --> 34:26.698
Whoa, whoa.
Come on.

34:26.732 --> 34:28.200
Wait a second,
just wait a second.

34:28.234 --> 34:29.701
Jimmy, it's okay,
just-just be straight

34:29.735 --> 34:30.769
with them, all right?
Hold on.

34:30.802 --> 34:31.903
What part of this is okay, huh?

34:31.937 --> 34:34.440
Just give me a... wait a second.
Just give me a second.

34:34.473 --> 34:37.243
Why don't you sober up
and be useful again?

34:37.276 --> 34:39.311
(wailing sirens approaching)
Just give me a second.

34:39.345 --> 34:40.812
PHIL:
Oh, that's great.

34:49.688 --> 34:51.657
James Riordan,

34:51.690 --> 34:53.292
you're wanted for
questioning in the murder

34:53.325 --> 34:55.227
of one Johnny Tesla;
you want to come with us?

34:55.261 --> 34:57.196
No, I don't want
to come with you.
You're coming with us.

34:57.229 --> 34:58.264
Hey, I don't know anything
about this.

35:00.832 --> 35:03.135
Hey, you want to add
resisting arrest to this?

35:03.169 --> 35:05.271
JAMIE:
Okay, easy. Easy.
I get a lawyer?

35:05.304 --> 35:07.506
(handcuffs clicking)
Do I get a lawyer?

35:07.539 --> 35:08.874
Yeah, you get a lawyer.

35:10.409 --> 35:11.610
You set me up?

35:11.643 --> 35:13.279
Answer me!

35:13.312 --> 35:14.813
Of course not.

35:14.846 --> 35:18.250
Mr. Riordan, you have
the right to remain silent

35:18.284 --> 35:19.785
and to refuse to
answer questions.

35:20.852 --> 35:22.721
Anything you say may
be used against you

35:22.754 --> 35:24.390
in a court of law.

35:27.959 --> 35:31.463
I am here alone
with my producer.

35:31.497 --> 35:33.365
And my only agenda is

35:33.399 --> 35:34.666
to get his side
of the story.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.668
Oh, I'll call you back.

35:36.702 --> 35:38.604
Detective?

35:38.637 --> 35:40.406
Damn it!

35:40.439 --> 35:41.873
You tell your father...

35:41.907 --> 35:43.375
I apologize, Ms. Maines.

35:43.409 --> 35:44.576
What the hell
is going on here?

35:44.610 --> 35:46.278
Craig Iverson,
you're under arrest

35:46.312 --> 35:48.314
for attempted assault
in the first degree.

35:48.347 --> 35:51.283
What?!
JACKIE:
You have the right
to remain silent,

35:51.317 --> 35:52.684
anything you say...

35:52.718 --> 35:54.453
Craig, what the hell is this?

35:54.486 --> 35:55.621
What? Why?

35:55.654 --> 35:56.688
What is this?

35:56.722 --> 35:57.923
You were gonna fire me.

35:57.956 --> 35:59.558
For what, getting older?

35:59.591 --> 36:00.859
You hacked into my e-mail?

36:00.892 --> 36:02.494
(handcuffs clicking)
Just use me up

36:02.528 --> 36:04.396
and then toss me aside
when you're done?

36:04.430 --> 36:06.732
So you toss acid in my face?

36:06.765 --> 36:08.400
That was just a warning.

36:08.434 --> 36:10.402
You can't treat people
like this!

36:10.436 --> 36:13.339
I treated you just fine,
and you know it.

36:14.473 --> 36:15.807
Age has nothing to do with it.

36:15.841 --> 36:16.942
You're just sloppy

36:16.975 --> 36:18.377
and arrogant
in your work.

36:18.410 --> 36:20.379
Come on.
Craig, you're so sloppy,

36:20.412 --> 36:22.481
you can't even get
your revenge right.

36:22.514 --> 36:23.815
Anything you say may
be used against you...

36:23.849 --> 36:25.284
I want to talk to a lawyer.

36:25.317 --> 36:26.151
How many times have we laughed

36:26.184 --> 36:27.185
when the guy on the tape
copped to that?

36:27.219 --> 36:29.355
You're a son of a bitch,
you know that?
Whoa.

36:29.388 --> 36:31.757
You're a son of a bitch.
Come on, come on.
Come on.

36:31.790 --> 36:34.493
Trust me, you'll
thank me later.

36:34.526 --> 36:36.928
Look, he's going down to the
squad for processing, all right?

36:36.962 --> 36:37.896
My old man's close by.

36:37.929 --> 36:39.898
He said if you need
a ride back into town,

36:39.931 --> 36:41.467
he'll be happy
to give you a lift.

36:42.501 --> 36:44.370
Thank you.

36:44.403 --> 36:46.405
You're welcome.

36:48.807 --> 36:52.444
Nothing on the wiretaps
that they knew where Bianca is.

36:52.478 --> 36:55.013
I've got a couple of men
looking into it from our side.

36:55.046 --> 36:57.215
They'd really off
one of their own?

36:58.917 --> 37:00.786
Johnny Tesla
was one of their own.

37:02.421 --> 37:05.657
At any rate,
Jimmy Riordan's retired for now.

37:05.691 --> 37:08.427
We got what we need on
the Sanfinos and the Cavazzeres.

37:08.460 --> 37:09.895
All that's left is a roundup,

37:09.928 --> 37:11.430
thanks to your good work,
Reagan.

37:18.537 --> 37:20.339
Look, when I said I wanted out,

37:20.372 --> 37:22.508
it was just the nerves talking.

37:22.541 --> 37:23.709
Just the nerves?

37:23.742 --> 37:25.811
I've never been responsible

37:25.844 --> 37:27.479
for somebody's death before.

37:27.513 --> 37:29.815
It sucks, don't it?

37:29.848 --> 37:30.949
I'll get over it.

37:30.982 --> 37:32.551
No, you probably won't.

37:32.584 --> 37:33.885
That's a good thing, too,

37:33.919 --> 37:36.355
because if it didn't eat
at you just a little bit,

37:36.388 --> 37:38.524
you wouldn't be
one of the good guys.

37:38.557 --> 37:39.825
You'd be more like one of them.

37:42.328 --> 37:44.830
Hey.

37:44.863 --> 37:48.334
Anybody handles themselves in a
situation the way you just did,

37:48.367 --> 37:50.436
keeps his mouth shut
and his jockeys clean,

37:50.469 --> 37:52.804
we need that guy.

38:00.712 --> 38:03.549
(knocking on door)

38:03.582 --> 38:07.052
Sir.
Thank you.

38:19.030 --> 38:20.566
Oh, hey.

38:20.599 --> 38:22.601
Hey.

38:22.634 --> 38:25.036
I was this close
to making a clean getaway.

38:27.606 --> 38:29.541
What's in the box?

38:29.575 --> 38:31.443
It's a parting gift.

38:31.477 --> 38:33.879
You lost that interview
partly 'cause of me.

38:33.912 --> 38:35.781
I didn't want you
to leave town empty-handed.

38:37.616 --> 38:39.885
It's me that should have
gotten you something.

38:39.918 --> 38:41.453
You don't have to open it now.

38:41.487 --> 38:43.389
I want to open it right now.

38:43.422 --> 38:44.690
Okay.

38:46.725 --> 38:49.528
(sighs)

38:51.730 --> 38:52.964
If you're going to carry,

38:52.998 --> 38:55.100
you need a proper holster.

38:55.133 --> 38:58.670
That piece in the purse thing
is for amateurs in old movies.

39:00.506 --> 39:02.641
I never thought I would
say this about a holster,

39:02.674 --> 39:05.877
but it's kind of beautiful.

39:05.911 --> 39:08.514
It's French calfskin

39:08.547 --> 39:10.148
and conformed to fit
your Walther perfectly.

39:10.181 --> 39:11.650
I know a guy.

39:11.683 --> 39:13.619
(chuckles)
Of course you know a guy.

39:13.652 --> 39:16.121
It's made to be worn
on the inside of your thigh.

39:23.662 --> 39:24.830
Thank you.

39:24.863 --> 39:26.665
You're welcome.

39:26.698 --> 39:28.567
So, you got to go?

39:28.600 --> 39:31.903
I've got church
and Sunday dinner.

39:33.605 --> 39:36.542
Better go to
confession first.

39:39.110 --> 39:40.446
Where are you headed?

39:40.479 --> 39:41.513
Anguilla.

39:41.547 --> 39:45.684
It's a little island
in the British West Indies.

39:45.717 --> 39:49.488
Three days of white sand
and blue water.

39:49.521 --> 39:51.122
You want to come with?

39:51.156 --> 39:53.158
Some day.

39:55.461 --> 39:57.596
No pressure.

39:57.629 --> 39:58.930
No regrets.

40:17.716 --> 40:19.718
Keep telling it
like it is, baby.

40:21.820 --> 40:24.656
I'll see you, Frank.

40:24.690 --> 40:27.726
(Frank humming)

40:29.961 --> 40:31.697
* Ba-ba-ba

40:31.730 --> 40:33.599
* Bum-ba-bum-bum-bum.

40:33.632 --> 40:37.503
You sang loud in
church today, Grandpa.

40:37.536 --> 40:39.104
Did I?
HENRY:
Yeah.

40:39.137 --> 40:42.140
And you bent the phrasing like
you were channeling Sinatra.

40:42.173 --> 40:43.509
Wasn't on purpose.

40:43.542 --> 40:44.676
Ring-a-ding-ding.

40:45.744 --> 40:47.679
Grandpa had very good sleep
last night.

40:47.713 --> 40:48.780
(snorts, giggles)

40:49.915 --> 40:51.483
Woke up a new man.

40:51.517 --> 40:52.951
Full of vim and vigor.

40:55.687 --> 40:57.623
Now, boys,

40:57.656 --> 41:00.492
to make a proper
Irish coffee, the last step

41:00.526 --> 41:03.662
is crucial,
so pay attention to this.

41:03.695 --> 41:06.798
You have to ladle the cream

41:06.832 --> 41:08.700
over the back of the spoon,

41:08.734 --> 41:10.068
so it doesn't just plop in

41:10.101 --> 41:13.772
and muddy the coffee

41:13.805 --> 41:15.774
and the whiskey.

41:15.807 --> 41:17.175
Thank you.

41:17.208 --> 41:18.276
Pass the virgins down.

41:18.309 --> 41:21.947
Would you like them
one at a time or all at once?

41:23.014 --> 41:25.951
Well, you walked
right into that one.

41:25.984 --> 41:27.786
Am I missing something?
