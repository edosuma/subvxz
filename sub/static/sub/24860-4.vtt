Robert, darling.

02:04.375 --> 02:07.583
Let's say hello later.
We need to go to the airport,

02:07.667 --> 02:10.291
pick up Granny Kettle.

02:10.375 --> 02:12.834
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Fucking hell!

02:12.917 --> 02:16.875
- Patrick!
- I wanna go horse-riding,
I wanna go horse-riding!

02:16.959 --> 02:18.834
Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry,
Thomas.

02:18.917 --> 02:20.959
Oh, okay.

02:22.583 --> 02:24.250
Oh, I was only just
dropping off.

02:24.333 --> 02:25.792
I've been awake half the night.

02:25.875 --> 02:27.875
- And now it's time to get up.

02:27.959 --> 02:30.041
I thought we were on holiday?

02:30.125 --> 02:34.417
So did I. But we've been up
since five, haven't we, Thomas?

02:36.417 --> 02:37.458
Right.

02:37.542 --> 02:39.083
We're off to the airport
to fetch my mother.

02:39.166 --> 02:41.959
- Mm. Don't rush back.

02:42.041 --> 02:44.834
Well, there's lots to do.

02:44.917 --> 02:48.083
Open all the windows,
air the place.

02:48.166 --> 02:51.291
And you ought to finish the
unpacking. That'd be helpful.

02:51.375 --> 02:52.458
- Thomas.

02:53.834 --> 02:55.000
Robert, airport!

02:55.083 --> 02:57.917
Robert, airport!

03:10.166 --> 03:12.917
Yeah!

03:35.667 --> 03:37.125
- Seamus.
- Patrick!

03:37.208 --> 03:40.000
I thought I heard your car
last night.

03:40.083 --> 03:41.959
Welcome back.

03:42.041 --> 03:44.041
Eleanor cannot wait to see you.

03:44.125 --> 03:46.208
Oh, sorry, this is Kevin.

03:47.083 --> 03:48.959
- Annette.
- Hey, Patrick.

03:49.041 --> 03:51.458
We were just discussing how
wonderful your mother is,

03:51.542 --> 03:54.458
to let the Foundation
make use of your beautiful home.

03:54.542 --> 03:56.250
Amazing woman. She's helped
so many people to connect.

03:56.333 --> 03:59.291
- With other realities.

03:59.375 --> 04:01.542
Yes. Well, meanwhile,
back in this one,

04:01.625 --> 04:04.000
I opened my wardrobe this
morning to find so many copies

04:04.083 --> 04:06.125
of Way Of The Soul,  they were
getting in the way of the shoes.

04:06.208 --> 04:08.166
"Way of the shoes." Genius.

04:08.250 --> 04:10.875
It's actually a better title:

04:11.000 --> 04:13.125
reminding us to keep our feet
on the ground.

04:13.208 --> 04:15.291
Do you think these signs
of institutional life

04:15.375 --> 04:17.834
could be removed
when we're here on holiday?

04:17.917 --> 04:19.000
In August,
this is our family home.

04:19.083 --> 04:21.458
Of course. I apologize.

04:21.542 --> 04:23.041
These leaflets on reiki
workshops and healing circles

04:23.125 --> 04:25.500
are entirely lost on us.

04:25.583 --> 04:27.417
And this board,
while an attractive cork,

04:27.500 --> 04:28.750
is yours, not ours.

04:28.834 --> 04:30.667
I'll take it to my cottage.

04:30.750 --> 04:34.709
- Where she lets me stay.

04:34.792 --> 04:37.792
For how long? I thought
you were going back to Ireland.

04:37.875 --> 04:39.959
No, I'm here
for the whole summer.

04:40.041 --> 04:41.625
You won't even know I'm here.

05:09.792 --> 05:12.125
Monsieur Melrose?

05:12.208 --> 05:14.917
Bonjour, Claudine.
Comment va ma mère?

05:16.583 --> 05:18.917
Si vous voulez la voir,
elle vous attend.

05:34.709 --> 05:36.542
I want you to know that...

05:37.166 --> 05:39.959
..I'm very unhappy...

05:40.875 --> 05:43.667
..at not...

05:44.834 --> 05:46.667
..being able to communic...

05:47.834 --> 05:49.417
Yes.

05:49.500 --> 05:50.667
- That must be horrible.
Yes.

05:53.333 --> 05:55.083
Horrible.

05:56.125 --> 05:57.583
Yes.

05:58.834 --> 06:00.542
But I am brave.

06:08.667 --> 06:11.500
Er...the others are at the
airport picking up Mary's
mother.

06:11.583 --> 06:13.125
They're all very keen
to see you.

06:13.208 --> 06:14.792
Only when you feel up to it,
of course.

06:14.875 --> 06:19.709
And Thomas has grown,
as you'd...expect.

06:19.792 --> 06:21.583
Are they er...

06:22.333 --> 06:23.959
- Thomas...

06:24.041 --> 06:26.792
..is like me.

06:30.041 --> 06:31.917
I'm sorry, I'm just trying to...

06:41.709 --> 06:43.166
Good flight, Kettle?

06:43.250 --> 06:45.500
Hello, Patrick. No, hideous.

06:45.583 --> 06:49.125
There was an awful woman next
to me who was terrifically proud
of her breasts

06:49.208 --> 06:50.917
and kept sticking them
in her child's face.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.750
It's called
breastfeeding.

06:52.834 --> 06:53.959
Thank you, darling.

06:54.041 --> 06:56.333
I know it's all the rage but
when I was having children

06:56.417 --> 07:00.875
the clever woman was the one
who went to the party looking as
if she'd never been pregnant,

07:00.959 --> 07:02.959
not the one with
her breasts sticking out.

07:03.041 --> 07:04.625
- Daddy, I'm coming!
- At least not for
breastfeeding.

07:04.709 --> 07:07.250
Robert, will you show
Granny to her room?

07:09.834 --> 07:12.000
Patrick?

07:20.917 --> 07:22.875
Goodness, you're drinking.

07:22.959 --> 07:23.917
Temporary measure.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.834
It's been a while.

07:26.917 --> 07:28.875
She's really outdone herself
this time.

07:28.959 --> 07:30.709
From the solicitor's,
care of my mother -

07:30.792 --> 07:32.041
if "care" is the right word.

07:32.125 --> 07:33.959
I've been disinherited.

07:34.834 --> 07:36.166
What?

07:36.250 --> 07:37.333
She's signing the house
over to this joke charity.

07:37.417 --> 07:40.000
Nothing to us,
nothing to our children.

07:40.083 --> 07:43.041
- Patrick, that's awful--
- Oh, and she wants me
to check for loopholes,

07:43.125 --> 07:45.000
make sure the whole thing
runs smoothly.

07:45.083 --> 07:46.583
It's not enough
to be disinherited,

07:46.667 --> 07:48.875
she wants me to
chip in with the paperwork!

07:48.959 --> 07:50.917
- Took her half the morning,

07:51.000 --> 07:53.041
but apparently
she wants "to do good".

07:53.125 --> 07:56.291
She wants to help people -
anyone, really,

07:56.375 --> 07:58.208
just as long as they're not
fucking related to her!

07:58.291 --> 08:01.709
- Not so loud.
- She seeks "closure"
and "my validation".

08:01.792 --> 08:03.625
That bastard Seamus
might as well be

08:03.709 --> 08:05.166
whispering in her fucking ear!

08:05.250 --> 08:06.375
- Darling, you're ranting.
- I have to rant!

08:06.458 --> 08:09.208
She was always a lousy mother.

08:09.291 --> 08:12.250
But I hoped she might take
a holiday from that towards
the end of her life,

08:12.333 --> 08:15.667
feel that she'd achieved enough
by way of betrayal and neglect

08:15.750 --> 08:18.041
and that now it was time
for her to take a break

08:18.125 --> 08:19.583
and play with her grandchildren.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.166
You know what frightens me
the most

08:21.250 --> 08:23.333
is how much I loathe her!

08:24.834 --> 08:27.959
When I read the letter,
I tried to loosen my collar
so I could breathe

08:28.041 --> 08:29.291
and I realized
it wasn't my collar,

08:29.375 --> 08:31.208
it was actually a noose
tightening around my neck -

08:31.291 --> 08:34.000
a noose of loathing!

08:34.083 --> 08:36.333
She's not going to change
now. She's a frightened woman--

08:36.417 --> 08:38.291
I know! I know.

08:38.375 --> 08:41.208
What do I loathe, then?

08:41.291 --> 08:43.291
I loathe...

08:43.375 --> 08:47.709
the poison dripping down
from generation to generation.

08:49.750 --> 08:52.834
And I'd rather die than inflict
the same thing on our children.

08:55.125 --> 08:57.917
That won't happen.

08:59.667 --> 09:00.667
Not if we don't let it.

09:04.208 --> 09:06.750
- But please don't drink.

09:07.291 --> 09:07.959
For us.

09:14.917 --> 09:16.709
♪ ♪

09:22.125 --> 09:24.125
♪ ♪

09:58.417 --> 10:02.083
She's giving it all away?

10:02.166 --> 10:03.959
To the charity, yes.

10:05.458 --> 10:08.291
Strange kind of charity.

10:12.583 --> 10:15.917
Robert. Go and say hello.

10:20.875 --> 10:21.959
I'm only telling you in case...

10:22.041 --> 10:23.208
Patrick!
- ..Patrick seems a little off.

10:23.291 --> 10:25.291
So he should be!

10:25.375 --> 10:27.583
It's so lovely here.

10:27.667 --> 10:30.417
You found it.
- Yes.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.375
Oh, it's good to be here.

10:32.458 --> 10:34.166
Who's this now?

10:34.250 --> 10:35.375
I told you,
it's Patrick's friend Julia.

10:35.458 --> 10:38.834
Lucy's her daughter.

10:38.917 --> 10:41.000
He certainly seems
pleased to see her.

10:41.083 --> 10:42.208
Hello, Mary!

10:42.291 --> 10:44.375
He's just being nice.

10:45.125 --> 10:47.500
She's been having a hard time.

10:50.166 --> 10:53.458
But can't you fight it? You're
a barrister, for Christ's sake!

10:53.542 --> 10:56.291
She may be an unmaternal idiot
but it's her money.

10:56.375 --> 10:59.375
If she wants to burn the last
of it on a New Age hotel,

10:59.458 --> 11:00.959
there's nothing
I can do to stop her.

11:01.041 --> 11:06.333
Well, can't you pretend to be a
shaman and keep the place?

11:06.417 --> 11:08.792
Sadly, I'm one of
the few people on earth

11:08.875 --> 11:10.959
that has absolutely
no healing powers.

11:14.917 --> 11:17.166
Why aren't you two
playing with each other?

11:17.250 --> 11:18.917
Play.

11:20.041 --> 11:21.500
Play!

11:23.375 --> 11:25.792
Besides, I find it difficult
enough looking after my family,

11:25.875 --> 11:27.542
let alone saving the world.

11:28.750 --> 11:31.417
I think looking after
your children

11:31.500 --> 11:34.083
can be another way of giving up.

11:37.041 --> 11:39.125
Well, they become
the whole ones,

11:39.208 --> 11:41.166
the well ones, the ones
who don't drink too much,

11:41.250 --> 11:44.208
get divorced,

11:44.291 --> 11:46.083
become mentally ill.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.959
You spend so much time
guarding them

11:51.041 --> 11:53.041
against decay and depression

11:53.125 --> 11:56.000
that you end up
decayed and depressed.

12:00.917 --> 12:02.250
Sorry.

12:02.333 --> 12:04.375
I'm a bit down.

12:05.625 --> 12:09.000
Since the divorce, I get these
terrible moments of vertigo,

12:11.125 --> 12:13.083
like I don't exist.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.125
I get that.

12:15.208 --> 12:17.500
At your age? I think
that's very pretentious.

12:17.583 --> 12:19.625
It's true.

12:19.709 --> 12:22.125
But it doesn't stop you
being a happy child, does it?

12:22.208 --> 12:25.125
Sometimes.

12:25.208 --> 12:26.917
When it's happening.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.083
You're doing a wonderful job.

12:36.667 --> 12:38.917
Hello, there.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.500
Oh, Christ, it's the landlord.

12:40.583 --> 12:43.417
You don't like Julia very much.

12:43.500 --> 12:44.333
Robert!

12:44.417 --> 12:47.166
I do like her.

12:47.250 --> 12:50.834
But whereas clever people
are just thinking out loud,

12:50.917 --> 12:52.917
Julia's thinking about
what she sounds like.

12:55.083 --> 12:58.625
- I shouldn't have said that.

12:59.333 --> 13:01.917
Don't repeat it.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.667
Are you a healer
yourself?

13:05.750 --> 13:08.625
Yes, Seamus,
who have you healed?

13:08.709 --> 13:12.917
Well, I actually worked in a
nursing home for many years,

13:13.041 --> 13:15.041
washing patients
covered in their own feces,

13:15.125 --> 13:17.333
spoon-feeding old people
who couldn't feed themselves,

13:17.417 --> 13:18.458
that sort of thing.

13:18.542 --> 13:21.041
And, do you know what?
I'm grateful for it, Julia.

13:21.125 --> 13:22.709
It's kept me grounded.

13:22.792 --> 13:24.709
What a shame you didn't stick to
that. You might have actually
done some tangible good.

13:24.792 --> 13:27.458
Patrick likes to keep me
grounded too.

13:27.542 --> 13:29.542
But I think we do
tangible good here,

13:29.625 --> 13:32.041
with the courses we run.

13:32.125 --> 13:35.333
We bring inner-city kids here
and they love it -

13:35.417 --> 13:37.375
the meditation, the drumming.

13:37.458 --> 13:39.417
They... They say to me...

13:39.500 --> 13:40.709
"Seamus, this is incredible!

13:40.792 --> 13:43.542
It's like tripping
without the drugs."

13:43.625 --> 13:45.500
Do we need a charity
for tripping?

13:45.583 --> 13:47.166
With all the ills in the world,

13:47.250 --> 13:49.208
it seems a rather
wild hole to plug.

13:49.291 --> 13:50.542
Can't you just give them acid?

13:50.625 --> 13:52.375
You can tell he's a barrister.

13:52.458 --> 13:53.875
I'm all for people
having hobbies.

13:53.959 --> 13:56.250
Can't they do it in the comfort
of their own homes?

13:56.333 --> 13:58.208
Sadly, Patrick, some homes
are not that comfortable.

13:58.291 --> 13:59.542
No.

13:59.625 --> 14:02.083
I know the feeling.

14:04.166 --> 14:05.542
Well, Julia...

14:05.625 --> 14:06.417
Fascinating.

14:06.500 --> 14:09.250
Mon pleasure.

14:12.041 --> 14:13.000
Seamus?

14:13.667 --> 14:15.083
Patrick?

14:15.166 --> 14:17.166
This gift of Eleanor's
about the house.

14:17.250 --> 14:19.667
- Yeah, she mentioned that.
- I'm looking into it.

the wallpaper just yet.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.500

15:26.458 --> 15:28.208
I hesitate to mention this.

15:28.291 --> 15:29.750
Please keep on hesitating.

15:29.834 --> 15:33.041
But this idea of yours
to sign the house over

15:33.125 --> 15:34.250
to the Foundation...

15:34.333 --> 15:38.083
I've looked over the paperwork
and I have to point out

15:38.166 --> 15:39.667
- it leaves you very exposed.
- I really...

15:39.750 --> 15:43.166
- Of course you must do as you
wish but your store of capital--
- No, please...

15:43.250 --> 15:45.333
- No.
- ..won't pay for much more--

15:45.417 --> 15:47.291
- I...
- ..care.

15:47.375 --> 15:49.041
We could go broke very quickly.

15:49.125 --> 15:51.083
Patrick is only trying to help.

15:51.166 --> 15:53.208
- You can do what you want.
- Yes.

15:53.291 --> 15:55.834
If you could just loan the house
for the time being--

15:55.917 --> 15:58.125
- I really do object!
- ..and decide...

16:06.125 --> 16:07.166
It's okay.

16:09.792 --> 16:12.542
Well, we'll leave you.

16:12.625 --> 16:14.667
You must be tired.

16:16.583 --> 16:18.375
Sorry if I upset you.

16:31.458 --> 16:35.125
Please don't...leave me.

16:48.166 --> 16:49.917
I want to go away.

16:51.667 --> 16:53.625
What do you mean?

16:53.709 --> 16:55.750
Leave here.

17:00.917 --> 17:02.250
Yes.

17:08.417 --> 17:12.250
What can drive a man mad is
being forced to have the emotion

17:12.333 --> 17:15.792
he's being forbidden to have
at the same time.

17:15.875 --> 17:17.792
The treachery
makes me feel furious

17:17.875 --> 17:19.417
and now
I'm being forced to feel pity.

17:19.500 --> 17:24.458
Well, I'm a simple sort of man
and I remain fucking angry!

17:24.542 --> 17:27.709
Robert, everyone's
by the pool. Go and join them.

17:34.875 --> 17:38.333
I don't think it's kind to turn
Robert against his grandmother.

17:38.417 --> 17:39.417
In a beauty contest

17:39.500 --> 17:40.792
between her only child
and a complete stranger,

17:40.875 --> 17:43.417
my mother chose the stranger.

17:43.500 --> 17:44.625
And you're right
to feel betrayed

17:44.709 --> 17:46.917
- but Robert has his own--
- No, we've all been lied to.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.250
Whatever happened in the past,

17:48.333 --> 17:51.792
at least we had somewhere
we all felt at home.

17:51.875 --> 17:54.291
And now all those little
concessions to family feeling

17:54.375 --> 17:56.083
are being tossed away
to be replaced

17:56.166 --> 17:58.291
by the trademark
family malice and spite.

17:58.375 --> 18:00.417
- Well, that's not inevitable!

18:00.500 --> 18:02.208
Not necessarily! Please.

18:02.959 --> 18:05.834
Spend time with the children.

18:07.250 --> 18:07.834
That's why we're here.

18:18.041 --> 18:20.458
Right, who wants
to play in the pool?

18:20.542 --> 18:22.291
- I'm reading.

18:22.375 --> 18:24.333
Oh, come on, let's play!

18:24.417 --> 18:26.208
That's why we're here.

18:28.709 --> 18:30.375
Julia?

18:30.458 --> 18:32.375
No No?

18:32.458 --> 18:34.500
- No, thanks.
- Didn't ask you.

18:34.583 --> 18:36.542
- Come on.
- Dad!

18:36.625 --> 18:38.500
Stop being silly!

18:38.583 --> 18:40.500
- Oh, come on, Robert.
- Stop!

18:40.583 --> 18:42.667
- Don't be a bore.
- Stop! I'm serious, stop!

18:55.500 --> 18:58.583
- I knew this would happen.
- Oh, for God's sake, Kettle.

18:58.667 --> 19:00.291
Oh, I'm sure he's fine.

19:00.375 --> 19:02.291
Of course he's fine. You're
fine, aren't you, Robert?

19:02.375 --> 19:04.709
- Yes, I'm fine.
- There, you see, he's fine.

19:05.917 --> 19:08.625
It's just a game, a bit of fun.

19:26.792 --> 19:29.000
That looks like fun.

19:29.083 --> 19:30.917
No, not fun.
Necessity, I'm afraid.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.917
Want one?

19:34.542 --> 19:36.667
- I've got my own.
- Of course you do.

19:36.750 --> 19:37.792
But if you're offering.
How long?

19:37.875 --> 19:39.583
Four years.

19:39.667 --> 19:43.792
I thought you were only meant
to take it for 30 days.

19:43.875 --> 19:45.959
Oh, I definitely have a problem.

19:46.041 --> 19:47.959
Namely that
they're not strong enough.

19:48.041 --> 19:50.709
I get all the side effects -
memory loss, dehydration,

19:50.792 --> 19:53.959
nightmarish withdrawals -
everything except the sleep.

19:57.667 --> 20:00.583
Strange to think
we used to do this for fun.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.583
Remember taking acid in Greece?

20:03.667 --> 20:04.917
I remember where you stashed it.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.834
Yes, sorry about that.

20:06.917 --> 20:08.792
I didn't mind.

20:12.166 --> 20:15.041
But let's not get nostalgic.

20:18.375 --> 20:19.750
Another pleasure denied.

20:19.834 --> 20:22.625
Whenever I get nostalgic,
I force myself to remember

20:22.709 --> 20:23.750
what youth was actually like.

20:23.834 --> 20:26.458
It was awful.

20:26.542 --> 20:29.166
The trouble is,
all I remember is the sex.

20:30.625 --> 20:33.458
A great abundance of sex
and a sense of potential

20:33.542 --> 20:36.458
instead of an absence of sex
and a sense of waste.

20:41.542 --> 20:43.917
Christ, I'm gonna need
40 milligrams tonight.

20:47.041 --> 20:48.834
Perhaps...

20:51.709 --> 20:54.041
Perhaps we shouldn't be
having this conversation.

20:56.792 --> 20:59.208
Perhaps not.

21:28.750 --> 21:30.959
Oh, my darling.

21:31.041 --> 21:33.125
So sorry to wake you.

21:36.166 --> 21:38.250

21:47.542 --> 21:48.583
Shall I pack my bag?

21:49.959 --> 21:51.834
Oh, my darling.

21:53.875 --> 21:55.500
I have to go without you.

21:55.583 --> 21:56.583
You can't.

21:56.667 --> 22:00.792
- Darling, please understand.
- I want to come.

22:00.875 --> 22:03.667
You have to stay here with your
father just for a short while.

22:03.750 --> 22:05.542
- I want to come.
- And then when I've spoken
to the lawyers...

22:05.625 --> 22:07.667
- No, please--
- Patrick.

22:12.041 --> 22:14.750

properly, yes?

22:15.709 --> 22:17.542
In exactly the right way.

22:19.083 --> 22:21.417
And then I can come back
and get you.

22:21.500 --> 22:22.583

- You didn't, actually,

26:00.542 --> 26:03.291
because swearing
was not allowed.

26:03.375 --> 26:04.917
Unlike some households.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.792
Which of our mothers is worst,
do you think?

26:06.875 --> 26:08.834
I realize the disinheritance
thing gives Eleanor the edge

26:08.917 --> 26:10.792
but yours is really
putting in the work.

I've always wanted to
look after the children myself.

26:24.792 --> 26:27.792
Yes, motherhood takes
some people that way.

26:27.875 --> 26:31.417
It didn't in my case but then I
was quite young when I had Lucy.

26:31.500 --> 26:34.000
I think you can be
too nice to children.

Oh, no, no, no, no.

26:59.250 --> 27:01.834
I wouldn't want to intrude
on a family affair.

27:03.542 --> 27:04.709
Well, maybe just for
a moment or two.

27:06.750 --> 27:08.792
- Patrick says you're a writer.

27:08.875 --> 27:11.208
I've sometimes thought myself
about writing a book.

I've got so many ideas but it's
putting them down on paper.

27:14.417 --> 27:16.834
It can do your head in.

27:16.917 --> 27:19.709
I've done a beginning -
several beginnings.

27:19.792 --> 27:21.792
But maybe it's
all just beginnings.

27:21.875 --> 27:23.875
- I do.

27:23.959 --> 27:26.083
She's doing this on purpose now
just to annoy us.

We won't give her

27:38.166 --> 27:39.750
I'm going to do a workshop.

27:39.834 --> 27:43.542
Yes, you should. It's the only
way you'll get to see the house
in the cherry season.

27:43.625 --> 27:48.000
Oh, the cherries!
Now, they are something.

27:48.083 --> 27:51.083
Me and Eleanor always
have this little ritual

27:51.166 --> 27:52.583
we do around the cherries,
don't we, Eleanor?

27:52.667 --> 27:55.709
- Yes.
- The fruits of life, you know.

27:55.792 --> 27:57.750
It sounds
very profound.

27:57.834 --> 27:58.917
Do they taste any better than if

27:59.000 --> 28:01.709
they were simply
the fruits of the cherry tree?

28:01.792 --> 28:02.917
Ch... Ch... Cherries.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.083
- I'll bring you some.
- What a handsome rent!

28:05.166 --> 28:08.333
No...
- A simple bowl of cherries
for all of this.

28:08.417 --> 28:09.917
- No...
- Talk about luck of the Irish.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.875
- No...
Enough!

28:11.959 --> 28:13.834
- ..rent!
- Rob...

28:15.500 --> 28:17.000
No.

28:17.083 --> 28:19.083
I'll go.

28:19.166 --> 28:19.917
It's my fault.

28:33.208 --> 28:36.125
I'm not giving you much
of a holiday, am I?

28:36.750 --> 28:40.250
Must try harder.

28:40.333 --> 28:42.291
Is Granny really giving
it all away?

28:44.250 --> 28:46.083
That's what she wants to do.

28:48.458 --> 28:50.250
We love it here.

28:50.333 --> 28:52.333
I know, but it's hers not ours.

28:52.417 --> 28:54.333
She's always been
pathologically generous.

28:54.417 --> 28:57.875
And if she was giving it
to the blind or the homeless

28:57.959 --> 29:01.041
or medical research
or victims of torture,

29:01.125 --> 29:04.417
we'd be...not delighted
but we'd understand.

29:05.375 --> 29:06.875
But...she's giving it to Seamus?

29:08.792 --> 29:10.375
To the Foundation.

29:10.917 --> 29:13.458
So, yes, to Seamus.

29:17.542 --> 29:19.041
Do you loathe her?

29:22.250 --> 29:22.834
Of course not.

29:22.917 --> 29:25.500
And you mustn't either.

29:26.250 --> 29:28.250
Well, this is a touching scene.

29:29.375 --> 29:33.333
Mary wants you back
before Seamus seduces Kettle.

29:33.417 --> 29:35.709
He's trying to get Mary
disinherited as well?

29:35.792 --> 29:37.917
We'll have to kill him
after all.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.166
If we kill Seamus,
do we keep the house?

29:40.250 --> 29:41.417
Sadly not.

29:41.500 --> 29:45.583
More efficient to kill Kettle
before she changes her will.

29:45.667 --> 29:48.875
You're right! I let emotion
cloud my judgment.

29:50.458 --> 29:52.291
I'm going to read my book.

30:04.166 --> 30:05.375
I suppose I should be
more careful.

30:05.458 --> 30:09.166
About what?

30:09.250 --> 30:12.041
I've tried so hard not to pass
on the malice and resentment,

30:14.458 --> 30:16.458
give them a different
sort of childhood.

30:18.583 --> 30:20.417
But they're just fresh mistakes.

30:21.542 --> 30:23.375
And Robert notices everything.

30:26.792 --> 30:29.125
He caught me
outside your room last night.

30:31.917 --> 30:33.125
What were you doing
outside my room?

30:34.750 --> 30:37.709
I thought I'd come and see you.

30:40.250 --> 30:42.083
Would you have been pleased?

30:50.667 --> 30:52.667
Maybe next time.

30:53.834 --> 30:56.750
There's going to be a next time?

30:58.250 --> 31:00.250
Well, you're bored and lonely.

31:00.333 --> 31:02.083
I'm bored and lonely.

31:02.166 --> 31:04.417
That's a terrifying amount of
boredom and loneliness

31:04.500 --> 31:06.583
in one room.

31:06.667 --> 31:08.458
Maybe they'll cancel
each other out,

31:08.542 --> 31:10.542
like electrical charges.

31:10.625 --> 31:12.500
Well, we should
conduct an experiment.

31:13.542 --> 31:15.542
In controlled conditions.

31:15.625 --> 31:18.208
See if we eliminate boredom

31:18.291 --> 31:20.667
or achieve
an overload of loneliness.

31:37.500 --> 31:40.291
We should go back.

31:41.834 --> 31:44.166
Or people will think
we're having an affair.

32:03.709 --> 32:05.667
I'm almost
too scared to ask.

32:07.166 --> 32:10.458
I'm cheering myself up.
This is by Boudin.

32:10.542 --> 32:13.333
Sell this, and we might
just be able to afford

32:13.417 --> 32:15.417
a second bedroom
in Queen's Park.

32:15.500 --> 32:17.417
A normal child-sized bedroom

32:17.500 --> 32:19.500
rather than a converted
broom cupboard.

32:19.583 --> 32:21.333
You can't steal from her.

32:21.417 --> 32:22.417
Not from her, from him.

32:22.500 --> 32:25.458
If he's getting the house
then I can certainly keep

32:25.542 --> 32:27.000
the fucking Boudin.

32:27.083 --> 32:29.000
Pass me that other screwdriver,
will you?

32:29.083 --> 32:30.709
You can't keep this up.

32:30.792 --> 32:33.333
At some point,
you have to let it all go.

32:33.417 --> 32:36.041
- Bit late for that.
- I don't mean the house.

32:40.709 --> 32:42.834
Do you want to come
up to bed with me?

32:42.917 --> 32:44.208
Let's not introduce
exciting words like "want".

32:44.291 --> 32:48.333
We both know that
Thomas will claim my place.

32:49.250 --> 32:50.834
I'll sleep down here.

32:51.667 --> 32:53.500
Pass the screwdriver, will you?

32:53.583 --> 32:55.083
Screwdriver?

33:20.792 --> 33:23.125
Mind if I come in?

33:36.333 --> 33:38.166
When's your flight?

33:40.792 --> 33:42.834
I have to leave by nine.

33:45.583 --> 33:47.333
- Our timing...
- Has never been good.

34:02.667 --> 34:04.667
I should go before
Thomas wakes up.

34:05.417 --> 34:07.458
Patrick...

34:07.542 --> 34:09.333
Summer fling.

34:10.875 --> 34:12.250
Yes?

34:13.583 --> 34:15.208
Summer fling.

34:21.375 --> 34:23.208
Well, thank you for having us.

34:24.208 --> 34:25.291
We'll speak on the phone.

34:25.375 --> 34:29.208
- When you get a chance.
- It won't be the same.

34:29.291 --> 34:31.291
No, it won't. Bye.

34:31.375 --> 34:32.834
Bye.

34:32.917 --> 34:36.417
Oh, dear. I wanted to say
goodbye to Seamus.

34:36.500 --> 34:38.333
Send him my love, won't you?

34:38.417 --> 34:41.625
It'll be strange to be here
without you, Patrick.

34:41.709 --> 34:43.709
Oh, is this your car?

34:43.792 --> 34:45.875
- Very small.
- Yes.

34:47.417 --> 34:48.875
Right, come on, let's go.
Buckle up, Lucy.

34:56.750 --> 34:59.583
Just us, thank God.

35:00.875 --> 35:03.583
And now we can have fun.

35:28.417 --> 35:30.417
It's the right thing to do.

35:30.500 --> 35:32.291
I'm sure it is.

35:35.667 --> 35:37.208
Also, it's a fake.

35:37.291 --> 35:38.959
I spoke to a man at Sotheby's.

35:39.041 --> 35:40.792
You can tell by the waves,
apparently.

35:40.875 --> 35:44.250
So Seamus isn't
the first man to bamboozle her.

35:45.458 --> 35:47.709
Some art dealer in Paris

35:47.792 --> 35:50.917
achieved that facile trick
40 years ago.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.083
- Well, let's not tell Seamus.
- Certainly not.

35:53.166 --> 35:56.375
Just picture his face
when he finds out.

35:56.458 --> 35:58.750
Oh, there go
the flotation tanks!

36:03.834 --> 36:05.834
I need to let all this go.

36:08.375 --> 36:10.375
When you've talked about the
things that have happened here,

36:14.208 --> 36:15.291
won't it help to move on?

36:17.333 --> 36:18.709
Perhaps.

36:23.333 --> 36:25.709
If I didn't have
my mother's protection...

36:28.583 --> 36:30.458
..at least I had
the protection of this place.

36:32.500 --> 36:36.750
Now that's being taken away too,
I fear I might go mad.

36:39.375 --> 36:40.959
At the same time, part of me

36:41.041 --> 36:43.667
can't wait to get rid of
the fucking place.

36:45.500 --> 36:47.291
Let's go back to London.

36:47.959 --> 36:51.333
Or somewhere else.

36:51.417 --> 36:53.417
After this holiday,
we need a holiday.

36:56.583 --> 36:58.375
Where would we go?

37:04.709 --> 37:06.041
- Bonjour, monsieur.
- Bonjour.

37:42.709 --> 37:44.458
C'est fini.

38:05.250 --> 38:07.333
I'm sure there's a good reason.

38:19.542 --> 38:23.625
It was such a big fight.
Ah, hello there.

38:23.709 --> 38:26.542
We're back.
It's Patrick, isn't it?

38:26.625 --> 38:28.917
- Kevin. Annette.
- We're making tea.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.875
I don't understand.

38:30.959 --> 38:33.458
Oh, did Seamus
not talk to you?

38:33.542 --> 38:35.583
He said there might be
a spare room.

38:40.417 --> 38:42.250
Seamus!

38:42.333 --> 38:44.750
I don't mean to disturb
your hard work.

38:44.834 --> 38:48.000
Not at all. Please, here.
Be my guest.

38:48.083 --> 38:50.417
Is that what I am now,
your guest?

38:50.500 --> 38:52.709
Or are you rather our guest
until we leave,

38:52.792 --> 38:54.375
because we're not prepared
to have you

38:54.458 --> 38:55.875
billet your sidekicks with us.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.625
I merely thought, given
that you've so much space,

38:58.709 --> 38:59.792
you could accommodate my guests.

38:59.875 --> 39:02.500
The terms of my mother's gift
are absolutely clear.

39:02.583 --> 39:06.083
"Terms" is a very legalistic way
of putting it.

39:06.166 --> 39:07.417
There's nothing in writing
about the Foundation

39:07.500 --> 39:11.542
providing you or your family
with a free holiday.

39:11.625 --> 39:13.041
Look, Robert,
go back to the house!

39:13.125 --> 39:14.417
I have genuine sympathy
for the trouble you're having--

39:14.500 --> 39:17.417
We're not talking about
the trouble I'm having.

39:17.500 --> 39:18.667
We're talking about
the trouble that you're having.

39:18.750 --> 39:19.792
They're inseparable.

39:19.875 --> 39:21.792
Everything seems inseparable
to a moron!

39:21.875 --> 39:23.542
Oh, let's all calm down,
shall we?

39:23.625 --> 39:24.834
My wife's your great defender,
Seamus.

39:24.917 --> 39:28.667
My theory is that you're a bad
man pretending to be an idiot,

39:28.750 --> 39:30.291
whereas she thinks
you're merely an idiot.

39:30.375 --> 39:31.792
If we could stay
on the subject--

39:31.875 --> 39:33.959
Perhaps the community
should hold a meeting

39:34.041 --> 39:37.792
- and Kevin and Annette--
- We're not part of
your fucking community!

39:37.875 --> 39:42.083
If you don't want to be part of
it, then maybe you should go.

39:42.166 --> 39:44.333
Why don't you go away,
you stupid man?

39:44.417 --> 39:45.583
This is my granny's house

39:45.667 --> 39:48.583
and we have more right
to be here than you do!

39:54.166 --> 39:55.583
Well...

39:57.208 --> 40:00.208
I'm gonna have to go and process
some of these negative feelings.

40:00.291 --> 40:03.083
You do that. Process away.

40:03.166 --> 40:03.959
Be my guest.

40:04.041 --> 40:06.834
Do a little ritual.

40:09.041 --> 40:12.750
Oh, one more thing.
My mother gave me this.

40:12.834 --> 40:15.458
It's a little shaky.
She's not well.

40:15.542 --> 40:17.625
It says, "Why Seamus no come?"

40:17.709 --> 40:20.875
Now she's given you the house,
you've dropped her.

40:20.959 --> 40:22.041
I don't need lectures from you

40:22.125 --> 40:23.750
about the importance of
my relationship to Eleanor.

40:23.834 --> 40:27.667
Just go and visit her.
I know she's not great company.

40:27.750 --> 40:31.583
But that's just one of the
treasure trove of things

40:31.667 --> 40:32.709
you have in common.

40:36.792 --> 40:38.625

Somewhere comfortable.

You beautiful boy.

42:12.041 --> 42:14.583
I...

42:14.667 --> 42:15.709
want you...

42:18.333 --> 42:20.166
..to kill me.

42:33.208 --> 42:35.834
I'd love to help
but it's against the law.

42:37.875 --> 42:39.041
No.

42:39.125 --> 42:39.875
No longer.

42:39.959 --> 42:42.625
Alright.

42:51.125 --> 42:53.333
Ready.

42:53.417 --> 42:55.458
Come on. Let's go.

44:28.667 --> 44:29.834
that he didn't tell the
truth...

Why don't you go sit

44:33.208 --> 44:36.083
You'd like that.

We'll go to Aunt Nancy's

That's it for the news.

Over to you, John...

44:54.208 --> 44:55.875
I'm cutting down, look.

45:03.834 --> 45:05.333
Come and say good night.

45:10.375 --> 45:13.208
Good night, then.

45:32.917 --> 45:35.291
Oh, God, she's invited Henry.

45:35.375 --> 45:37.208
- Oh, Nancy's cousin.

45:37.291 --> 45:41.125
He inherited all the money and,
well, that makes Nancy furious.

45:41.208 --> 45:43.000
Whatever you do,
don't mention politics.

45:43.083 --> 45:44.458
He's a nice guy but
pretty much a fascist.

45:44.542 --> 45:46.500
- Oh, good!
- Hello.

45:46.583 --> 45:49.333
Christ, I hate the rich!

45:49.417 --> 45:51.792
- Especially now you're not
going to become one.
- Especially now.

45:51.875 --> 45:54.000
Oh, there's a games room,
a cinema,

45:54.083 --> 45:54.750
and a pool, of course.

45:54.834 --> 45:57.417
This is very kind of you, Nancy.

45:57.500 --> 45:58.458
Well, after what
my sister's done to you,

45:58.542 --> 46:00.709
it's the least I could do.

46:00.792 --> 46:04.000
Oh, Patrick tells me
you're working now.

46:04.083 --> 46:06.333
Oh, I've always worked.
I'm in publishing.

46:06.417 --> 46:09.166
They won't run indoors,
will they--

46:09.250 --> 46:11.166
Of course not.

46:11.250 --> 46:13.166
..shouting, that sort of thing?

46:13.250 --> 46:15.333
Nonsense!
They must do whatever they want.

46:15.417 --> 46:17.083
Well, they should
stay out of the woods.

46:17.166 --> 46:20.917
It's a Lyme disease hotspot and
the tics are dreadful this year.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.500
Poison ivy, too.

46:22.583 --> 46:26.667
It looks pretty, but really,
it's like a Cambodian swamp.

46:26.750 --> 46:28.500
Best to assume
you're always in danger.

46:28.583 --> 46:31.417
A rule to live by.

46:31.500 --> 46:33.875
Robert, Thomas,
shall we go for a swim?

46:33.959 --> 46:35.750
I'll go and get
the swimming costumes.

46:35.834 --> 46:36.917
Yes, swimming time!

46:42.625 --> 46:45.583
Patrick,
could you come here?

46:45.667 --> 46:51.041
Oh, so many things, so many
lovely things, all stolen.

46:51.125 --> 46:53.583
A world-class fortune gone!

46:53.667 --> 46:55.291
These.

46:55.375 --> 46:56.917
These were ours.

46:57.000 --> 47:01.500
$1.5 million. That's what
my little stepbrother got

47:01.583 --> 47:03.417
for Mommy's garden tubs.

47:03.500 --> 47:06.417
I think you're doing
just fine here, Nancy.

47:06.500 --> 47:08.959
This place? Ho, believe me!

47:09.041 --> 47:10.667
This is nothing to what
we should have had.

47:10.750 --> 47:13.083
Shall we talk about my mother?

47:13.166 --> 47:16.125
There's no improvement
or hope of any improvement.

47:16.208 --> 47:19.166
She's aware of this
and has asked me to kill her.

47:19.875 --> 47:21.625
Oh, Patrick, that's not fair.

47:21.709 --> 47:24.417
That's really not fair.

47:24.500 --> 47:28.834
I have no doubt that helping her
to die would be the most loving
thing I could do.

47:28.917 --> 47:30.250
Oh, well, maybe...

47:30.333 --> 47:31.917
Maybe you should rent an
ambulance

47:32.000 --> 47:32.959
and drive her to Holland.

47:33.041 --> 47:37.250
Arriving in Holland
isn't in itself fatal.

47:37.333 --> 47:38.583
Oh, please let's not talk
about this anymore.

47:38.667 --> 47:40.834
It's very upsetting.

47:40.917 --> 47:42.125
I... I haven't told Mary yet,
so...

47:44.000 --> 47:45.959
Why haven't you told her?

47:46.041 --> 47:48.083
In case it's a good idea.

47:49.417 --> 47:52.000
Those swimming costumes?

47:52.083 --> 47:53.166
Nancy, we're very grateful.

47:53.250 --> 47:57.250
No, treat it like home.
But no wet feet on the carpets.

47:57.333 --> 47:58.625
Oh, of course.

47:58.709 --> 48:00.125
And no playing with figurines,
they're Meissen.

48:00.208 --> 48:02.834
I don't suppose you'd like
a drink before dinner?

48:02.917 --> 48:04.125
Oh, I don't drink.
Didn't you know?

48:04.208 --> 48:08.375
I watched it destroy Daddy's
life. But you help yourself.
