00:17.560 --> 00:19.640
- There he is again!
- Get him!

00:42.000 --> 00:43.840
I told you to stay away!

01:06.120 --> 01:07.960
He's here!

01:10.920 --> 01:12.840
We've warned you, Hari.

01:15.560 --> 01:16.560
No.

01:27.320 --> 01:28.720
Shit!

01:31.200 --> 01:34.040
Hey. Hey. Hello?
Can you hear me?

01:34.080 --> 01:36.920
Hello? Shit.

01:36.960 --> 01:38.360
Help! Somebody help me!

01:40.480 --> 01:42.400
We need a doctor here now.
Go!

01:49.960 --> 01:52.080
..five, six, seven... Come on!

01:55.240 --> 01:56.560
Shit!

02:47.600 --> 02:50.600
Stab to the side of his chest.
Arrested with tension.

02:50.640 --> 02:52.600
- I improvised.
- I can see that.

03:35.720 --> 03:38.840
Either both of us have got
personal hygiene problems

03:38.880 --> 03:40.640
or something is going on.

03:40.680 --> 03:44.280
Well, I'm freshly-showered and
wearing an expensive cologne.

03:44.320 --> 03:46.720
As a gentleman,
I can't comment further.

03:48.960 --> 03:50.560
Where is everyone?

03:50.600 --> 03:52.280
A kid from the beach
was attacked.

03:52.320 --> 03:54.320
They just dumped him
and drove off.

03:54.360 --> 03:57.720
- My God. Is he all right?
- I think so. Thanks to AJ.

03:57.760 --> 04:00.360
- AJ?
- He found him outside.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.280
Anyway, he's awake now.

04:02.320 --> 04:05.960
Dr Varma and Dr Walker are
fighting over the chest drain.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
No, my appointment is now!

04:08.040 --> 04:10.040
Mr Rahul is back again.

04:10.080 --> 04:13.440
If I've not told him once,
I've told him a thousand times.

04:13.480 --> 04:15.520
Memory clinic is on a Tuesday.

04:15.560 --> 04:18.440
Mr Rahul! No, not today, dear.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.480
Hey, hey. What are you doing?

04:50.520 --> 04:53.280
Looking for my clothes,
or at least my underwear.

04:53.320 --> 04:55.640
Please tell me
we weren't skinny dipping.

04:55.680 --> 04:57.560
No, no.
You're not going anywhere, mate.

04:57.600 --> 05:00.800
Fit as a fiddle. And they need
these beds for sick people.

05:00.840 --> 05:02.840
For Christ's sake, Paul!

05:02.880 --> 05:06.480
You nearly drowned last night.
I had to drag you out.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.640
You know what? For that,
I'm gonna buy you a pint.

05:10.040 --> 05:12.520
All right, two pints
and a packet of crisps.

05:12.560 --> 05:14.560
We both know
what you tried to do.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.680
I was pissed.
Beer-fuelled self-pity.

05:16.720 --> 05:19.080
I would have thought
a highly-trained barman

05:19.120 --> 05:21.120
could recognise that
at ten bloody yards.

05:21.160 --> 05:23.760
Bullshit! I was there.

05:23.800 --> 05:25.680
You meant every damn word.

05:25.720 --> 05:28.000
I was drunk
and now I'm going home.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.720
There you are.
Did you deal with Mr Rabul?

05:36.760 --> 05:39.520
Well, he saw my side of
the argument eventually.

05:39.560 --> 05:41.560
- Good.
- Wait, this came for you.

05:43.520 --> 05:45.920
Dr Fonseca?

05:45.960 --> 05:47.880
Yeah, thanks. That'll be all.

05:51.040 --> 05:53.000
Perhaps he's telling the truth?

05:53.040 --> 05:56.240
You weren't there. He wanted to
die. He as good as told me.

05:56.280 --> 05:58.280
What exactly is it
you want me to do?

05:58.320 --> 05:59.720
Help him!

05:59.760 --> 06:01.760
- Help me help him.
- Where is he?

06:01.800 --> 06:04.520
He's on his way back to the
hotel as if nothing's happened.

06:05.480 --> 06:07.040
Look, I'm sorry.

06:07.080 --> 06:09.560
Right now, there's someone
I need to see, urgently.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.600
And this isn't urgent?

06:11.640 --> 06:13.440
He trusts you. Stay with him.

06:13.480 --> 06:15.760
Try and persuade him to come
back and talk to me

06:15.800 --> 06:17.680
and we can
discuss medication,

06:17.720 --> 06:19.440
perhaps some grief counselling.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.880
That's what you've got?
Some pills and a chat?

06:21.920 --> 06:24.720
- There is nothing else.
- Can't you just, I mean...

06:24.760 --> 06:26.400
lock him up for his own safety?

06:26.440 --> 06:28.000
I'm a doctor, not a jailer!

06:28.040 --> 06:31.120
- I'll do everything I can.
- It's OK. I'll deal with it.

06:31.160 --> 06:33.080
Obviously it's my problem.

07:12.720 --> 07:14.120
Hello?

07:15.280 --> 07:17.800
Virginia? I got your letter.

07:17.840 --> 07:19.760
I came as soon as...

07:38.120 --> 07:40.120
- Finally!
- Christ!

07:40.160 --> 07:42.360
I hope you were
paying attention,

07:42.400 --> 07:44.360
because that's exactly
how I want them

07:44.400 --> 07:46.360
to discover me
when the time comes.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.560
Clear? Good.

07:50.760 --> 07:52.680
Let's have a drink.

07:58.880 --> 08:00.880
And take a deep breath again.

08:00.920 --> 08:03.800
It sounds better already.

08:03.840 --> 08:05.720
- Want to try?
- Sure.

08:06.640 --> 08:08.640
How's the pain?

08:08.680 --> 08:10.000
OK.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.680
Hari, I need to know
who did this to you.

08:16.160 --> 08:19.240
Did you have an argument
with someone?

08:19.280 --> 08:21.520
They catch me fishing
in the wrong place.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.520
Their territory.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.920
If I tell the police,
it will only be worse.

08:27.960 --> 08:30.240
You can't just let them
get away with it.

08:30.280 --> 08:31.960
Thank you for what you did.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.600
I'm grateful.

08:34.640 --> 08:37.240
But I don't want
to make trouble.

08:37.280 --> 08:39.400
But, Hari, if we do nothing,
then what?

08:41.320 --> 08:43.240
Next time
you might not be so lucky.

08:44.240 --> 08:46.160
How long have you been in India?

08:47.960 --> 08:49.440
Long enough.

08:51.840 --> 08:55.280
Then you will know
some things are different here.

08:57.400 --> 08:59.520
And some problems
can't easily solve.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.800
If you really want to help me...

09:04.520 --> 09:06.440
..then let me get out of here.

09:14.080 --> 09:16.080
I'm mentoring
a new young doctor.

09:16.120 --> 09:19.280
Really?

09:19.320 --> 09:21.640
I hope she's a better student
than you were.

09:23.240 --> 09:25.160
I've missed this, you and I.

09:27.240 --> 09:29.240
We used to talk all the time.

09:29.280 --> 09:31.280
What happened?

09:31.320 --> 09:33.800
You told me never
to darken your door again.

09:33.840 --> 09:37.920
Did I?
How very dramatic.

09:37.960 --> 09:40.280
Don't pretend you've forgotten,
Virginia.

09:42.040 --> 09:45.880
I remember being usurped
by my sweet little protégé.

09:45.920 --> 09:48.680
And I remember
we agreed it was for the best.

09:48.720 --> 09:50.720
All things considered.

09:50.760 --> 09:53.120
You considered me incompetent.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.160
I didn't have a choice, did I?

09:55.200 --> 09:58.120
No prisoners for Dr Fonseca.

09:58.160 --> 10:01.640
The most ruthless act was
justified for the greater good.

10:01.680 --> 10:04.440
I imagine nothing's changed.

10:04.480 --> 10:06.760
I still try to do
what's best for the hospital.

10:06.800 --> 10:09.480
How very noble.

10:09.520 --> 10:12.600
Did you get me all the way here
to rake over ancient history?

10:12.640 --> 10:14.640
Or really was it
just to insult me?

10:14.680 --> 10:18.080
Of course not.
This is just the entrée.

10:18.120 --> 10:20.040
I need you to hate me
just a little.

10:21.040 --> 10:22.960
The fire must be stoked.

10:24.920 --> 10:26.760
What is it you want, Virginia?

10:26.800 --> 10:28.760
I want you to kill me.

10:35.640 --> 10:37.640
It's all there.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.600
Read it and weep.

10:45.640 --> 10:48.440
Squamous cell carcinoma,
apex of the right lung.

10:48.480 --> 10:51.280
Locally advanced.

10:51.320 --> 10:55.000
Multiple metastases
in the liver, lungs and brain.

10:56.280 --> 11:00.120
A full house. Pay the bank.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.480
And before you ask,
I've had a second opinion.

11:02.520 --> 11:06.680
Every doctor this side of Kochi
thinks I'm dying...including me.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.200
- I'm sorry.
- No.

11:15.240 --> 11:17.240
Please don't be.

11:17.280 --> 11:19.600
I don't require
a bleeding heart.

11:27.080 --> 11:29.960
I've made you a barber's
appointment for the morning.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.800
This is the last time we are
together before the wedding.

11:32.840 --> 11:35.680
Why so much fuss? Nobody's
going to be looking at me.

11:36.440 --> 11:37.960
I will.

11:40.720 --> 11:43.960
Are you really sure about this?

11:44.000 --> 11:46.560
A beautiful,
sophisticated woman like you,

11:46.600 --> 11:48.520
getting married
to a man like me?

11:49.680 --> 11:51.600
I'm not exactly a prize catch.

11:52.680 --> 11:53.800
Hey.

11:55.560 --> 11:58.480
You're a strong man
and you're handsome.

12:00.800 --> 12:03.920
And that's exactly the kind of
man I've been dreaming of.

12:40.320 --> 12:42.840
Sir, wait. Wait.
Come, come, let me help you.

12:42.880 --> 12:44.560
Come.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.200
No. I won't do it.

12:55.240 --> 12:57.240
We all know
the end is not in doubt.

12:57.280 --> 13:00.400
I am dying! Let's not quibble
about the time.

13:00.440 --> 13:03.520
You have no right
to ask me this, Virginia.

13:03.560 --> 13:06.840
Lydia, you and I have spent
our lives helping other people.

13:06.880 --> 13:08.880
So help me now.

13:08.920 --> 13:11.000
I deserve it.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.600
Let other people
wash away their lives,

13:13.640 --> 13:15.440
but you and I,
we choose our fate.

13:15.480 --> 13:17.040
And I choose this now.

13:17.080 --> 13:18.480
No.

13:19.520 --> 13:21.440
I will not be a burden!

13:24.760 --> 13:28.440
Please. Please don't be a
selfish little bitch about this.

13:28.480 --> 13:29.520
Please.

13:32.240 --> 13:34.240
Stuff you, then!

13:34.280 --> 13:36.280
See what we've got in here.

13:36.320 --> 13:38.680
I'm sure I could mix up
a nice little cocktail.

13:43.120 --> 13:45.120
It doesn't have to be like this.

13:45.160 --> 13:47.920
Why don't you come home with me?
And I'll look after you.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.760
I'm sure the man
in your life

13:49.800 --> 13:51.640
would love having
a dying old woman

13:51.680 --> 13:54.560
rotting away on his couch
for weeks on end.

13:56.760 --> 13:59.960
Why don't you come and see
your hospital for the last time?

14:02.080 --> 14:04.080
See what I've done with it.

14:04.120 --> 14:06.040
Your legacy.

14:07.960 --> 14:09.880
And then do we have a deal?

14:11.640 --> 14:13.560
Then I'll think about it.

14:18.960 --> 14:21.360
Hey, erm...we need to speak
with your patient.

14:21.400 --> 14:22.800
I recognise his truck.

14:22.840 --> 14:25.000
We think he might be
one of Hari's attackers.

14:25.040 --> 14:27.480
No, his wound needs stitching.
That's my priority.

14:27.520 --> 14:29.440
Not two people
playing detective.

14:32.480 --> 14:33.720
Hey!

14:33.760 --> 14:36.920
What were you doing
in that truck this morning?

14:36.960 --> 14:38.800
I need to know what happened.

14:38.840 --> 14:41.440
It's none of your business.
Please.

14:41.480 --> 14:42.800
OK.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.360
AJ, I saw some police officers
outside. Could you...

14:45.400 --> 14:46.920
Wait.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.320
See, it's not my fault.

14:50.360 --> 14:53.760
I tried to stop them.
But people were angry after him.

14:53.800 --> 14:56.440
Just because he fished on
someone else's beach?

14:56.480 --> 14:59.320
Dr Walker?
A word outside, please?

14:59.360 --> 15:02.000
AJ, could you fetch me
a suture wire and a needle?

15:06.560 --> 15:09.320
I agree with my patient.
This is none of our business.

15:09.360 --> 15:11.360
Hari is in trouble
and I'm trying to help.

15:11.400 --> 15:13.400
How's that going, by the way?

15:13.440 --> 15:16.360
Your silence speaks volumes.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.400
So we just sit by
and do nothing?

15:18.440 --> 15:21.680
We patch him up, discharge him.
If necessary, we do it again.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.960
If idiots want to fight with
knives, that's their business.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
- I don't agree.
- Yes, I can see that.

15:29.280 --> 15:32.680
Look, how long are we
going to keep doing this?

15:32.720 --> 15:34.480
Keep doing what?

15:34.520 --> 15:38.040
Clearly you're angry about
what happened between us.

15:38.080 --> 15:41.480
But if it's going to affect our
job we both need to get over it.

15:41.520 --> 15:43.440
Don't you agree?

15:53.760 --> 15:55.680
Where did he go?

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Where's the patient
from that bed?

16:01.040 --> 16:02.360
Thanks.

16:11.040 --> 16:12.280
Hari?

16:25.280 --> 16:26.640
Chandran, please.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.920
- Yeah, big one?
- Yeah, big one.

16:37.960 --> 16:39.320
There you go.

16:39.360 --> 16:41.880
8,572 rupees.

16:41.920 --> 16:43.440
That makes us straight.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.480
For God's sake, Paul!

16:45.520 --> 16:46.920
Paul!

16:49.160 --> 16:50.800
Coming back here was a mistake.

16:50.840 --> 16:54.240
Don't get me wrong, it's good to
see you. I count you as a mate.

16:54.280 --> 16:57.040
So that's it? You just...
You just go home?

16:57.080 --> 16:59.720
Sometimes in life
you just have to admit defeat.

16:59.760 --> 17:01.800
No point in being
a damn fool about it.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.800
Well?

17:32.840 --> 17:35.280
Well, you've repainted
and I approve.

17:35.320 --> 17:36.880
Ram chose it.

17:36.920 --> 17:39.440
Nothing like having
your name over the door.

17:39.480 --> 17:41.560
Lets the world know
you've arrived.

17:41.600 --> 17:44.600
Dr Fonseca, thank goodness.
I'm so sorry, excuse me.

17:44.640 --> 17:47.600
Hitesh is here for his steroid
shot and insists you do it.

17:47.640 --> 17:50.960
Believe me, I have tried, but
there's no telling him today.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.200
Dr Walker. There's someone
I'd like you to meet.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.120
Dr Ruby Walker,
Dr Virginia Mileham,

17:56.160 --> 17:58.240
the doctor
who founded this place.

17:58.280 --> 18:00.280
Keep an eye on her for a minute,
will you?

18:01.320 --> 18:03.040
Hi. Very nice to meet you.

18:03.080 --> 18:05.600
- You're English?
- Sort of.

18:05.640 --> 18:07.280
It's a long story.

18:07.320 --> 18:11.040
Then for Christ's sake, don't
tell me. I'm on borrowed time.

18:11.080 --> 18:14.400
So, erm...
how's she treating you?

18:14.440 --> 18:16.520
Dr Fonseca is
an excellent teacher.

18:16.560 --> 18:18.560
Very diplomatic, Dr Walker.

18:18.600 --> 18:21.800
But what you really want to say
is she's a bloody nightmare.

18:23.400 --> 18:26.000
Of course, I taught her
everything she knows.

18:26.040 --> 18:28.000
Christ, it took years.

18:28.040 --> 18:31.920
Every lesson had to be drilled
into that thick skull of hers.

18:33.040 --> 18:35.800
Stubborn as a bloody mule.

18:35.840 --> 18:38.600
- Can I ask you a question?
- Go on.

18:38.640 --> 18:41.840
Why is it called the Good Karma
Hospital? Did you name it?

18:41.880 --> 18:43.400
No.

18:44.800 --> 18:47.200
It was one of my first patients,
actually.

18:47.240 --> 18:51.200
I'd been treating him.
And it... it just sort of stuck.

18:51.240 --> 18:55.000
He said, "Good medicine
is like good karma.

18:55.040 --> 18:57.040
Help others
and you help yourself.

18:57.080 --> 18:59.080
A virtuous circle."

18:59.120 --> 19:02.240
- What was wrong with him?
- Haemorrhoids.

19:02.280 --> 19:04.880
Probably one of the worst cases
I've ever seen.

19:06.880 --> 19:10.600
Suffering can be profound
and banal, Dr Walker,

19:10.640 --> 19:12.560
but it's suffering
just the same.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.800
Now I think you should go and
help that poor women's myxedema

19:17.840 --> 19:20.400
before she slips into a coma.

19:20.440 --> 19:22.960
Thinning hair,
slightly overweight.

19:23.840 --> 19:25.880
Obvious even from here.

19:25.920 --> 19:27.840
Right...thanks.

19:53.160 --> 19:55.920
It hurt when you usurped me,
Lydia.

19:57.840 --> 19:59.480
But I'm impressed.

20:01.520 --> 20:04.320
You took my little
cottage hospital

20:04.360 --> 20:07.400
and turned it into something
I could only dream about.

20:09.840 --> 20:11.760
All by removing
the weakest link.

20:14.160 --> 20:16.080
You were never that, Virginia.

20:18.600 --> 20:21.520
I simply followed my conscience.
You taught me that.

20:23.840 --> 20:27.040
I just couldn't have lived with
myself if someone had got hurt.

20:34.120 --> 20:37.280
I want to die
the way I've lived, Lydia.

20:38.600 --> 20:39.840
In control.

20:45.320 --> 20:46.840
Help me.

20:51.680 --> 20:55.160
Help me and then maybe
somebody will help you

20:55.200 --> 20:57.120
when your time comes.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.160
Trying it for size?

21:29.200 --> 21:31.840
Sorry. I'm just coming.

21:31.880 --> 21:33.800
Is it really true? With a pen?

21:35.440 --> 21:37.800
It's true.

21:37.840 --> 21:39.840
I didn't even know
you could write.

21:44.480 --> 21:46.600
- When's your flight?
- I'm going now.

21:46.640 --> 21:48.280
But what are you gonna do?

21:48.320 --> 21:50.640
Know how many stadiums
are in the Football League?

21:50.680 --> 21:52.560
- 92.
- Correct.

21:52.600 --> 21:54.600
And if you watch a match
in each of them,

21:54.640 --> 21:56.840
you get to apply for
a tie or something.

21:56.880 --> 21:59.480
Then there's annual dinners
and a newsletter.

21:59.520 --> 22:01.440
- That's your plan?
- Why not?

22:01.480 --> 22:03.960
- Should keep me out of trouble.
- I don't believe you.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.800
On that beach,
you wanted to die.

22:05.840 --> 22:08.400
And I don't think any bloody
thing's changed, has it?

22:11.160 --> 22:13.400
No.

22:13.440 --> 22:16.400
So if you get on that flight...

22:16.440 --> 22:18.240
..we're never gonna
see you again.

22:20.120 --> 22:23.040
Pity the poor bastard
that finds you.

22:23.080 --> 22:25.480
Come, on Paul! Talk to me!

22:27.320 --> 22:29.280
I could talk to you.

22:29.320 --> 22:32.480
I could talk to any Tom, Dick or
Harry till I'm blue in the face.

22:32.520 --> 22:34.360
And she'd still be gone.

22:34.400 --> 22:36.560
She'll still be dead
and I'll still be here -

22:36.600 --> 22:39.360
stuck, abandoned.

22:39.400 --> 22:41.600
- She was the love of your life.
- Yeah, she was.

22:41.640 --> 22:44.360
- And now she's gone.
- That makes you a lucky man.

22:44.400 --> 22:46.280
How do you work that one out?

22:46.320 --> 22:48.440
Millions of people
live out their days

22:48.480 --> 22:50.960
without ever knowing
what that feels like.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.160
They go to their graves
still wondering.

22:53.200 --> 22:55.320
But not you.

22:55.360 --> 22:57.360
You won the bloody lottery.

22:57.400 --> 22:59.400
And now I've lost the ticket.

22:59.440 --> 23:01.360
But you had it!

23:02.200 --> 23:04.560
True bloody love.

23:05.680 --> 23:08.080
And it's yours to keep.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.320
Which makes you
the luckiest man I know.

23:11.920 --> 23:13.960
Luckiest man standing here,
anyway.

23:19.360 --> 23:20.920
I've got a plane to catch.

24:03.880 --> 24:06.400
Can you stop the car, please?
I need to get out.

25:35.520 --> 25:37.880
I'll always be waiting for you.

25:39.560 --> 25:41.400
There's no rush.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.520
No rush at all.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
I've been a fool, Maggie.

25:54.040 --> 25:55.480
Yes.

25:59.160 --> 26:01.080
I'm sorry.

26:03.280 --> 26:05.840
I know. I know.

26:40.520 --> 26:42.520
We kept it secretly for so long.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.480
No one had any idea.

26:45.760 --> 26:47.680
Maybe I got careless.

26:47.720 --> 26:50.360
I don't know.

26:50.400 --> 26:53.360
It's hard to hide
how you feel about someone.

26:55.560 --> 26:57.560
And they attacked you?

26:57.600 --> 26:59.320
Yes.

26:59.360 --> 27:01.360
What about Chandran?

27:01.400 --> 27:03.160
Why didn't he try and stop them?

27:03.200 --> 27:05.120
What choice did he have?

27:06.280 --> 27:09.080
They would have killed us both.

27:09.120 --> 27:11.440
At least this way,
only one of us gets hurt.

27:14.320 --> 27:16.240
- You think we are wrong?
- No.

27:17.720 --> 27:20.240
But what you are doing
is against the law.

27:22.240 --> 27:24.480
- And you agree with that?
- Of course not.

27:25.680 --> 27:27.600
But it is the truth.

27:29.160 --> 27:32.320
In the city...
people turn a blind eye.

27:33.760 --> 27:35.680
Outside the city...

27:37.600 --> 27:39.520
I can never go home now...

27:40.800 --> 27:42.720
..never see my family again.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.280
Chandran.

28:13.040 --> 28:14.960
Sometimes love
is worth the risk.

28:17.320 --> 28:18.760
Yeah.

28:55.160 --> 28:57.080
Good health.

29:04.920 --> 29:06.400
I'm frightened.

29:07.960 --> 29:09.400
I know.

29:16.280 --> 29:17.720
Stuff it.

29:55.760 --> 29:58.880
There's erm...
room for a little one.

30:21.400 --> 30:23.080
Thank you.

30:29.480 --> 30:31.400
Don't be lonely, Lydia.

30:33.480 --> 30:35.400
You deserve so much more.

30:38.760 --> 30:40.680
Promise me that.

30:43.880 --> 30:45.600
I promise.

31:20.360 --> 31:22.360
Yes, I've just found her.

31:22.400 --> 31:24.320
She's been unwell for some time.

31:26.120 --> 31:27.720
Thank you.

31:50.160 --> 31:52.160
What are you wearing?

31:52.200 --> 31:54.200
The wedding's in an hour.

31:54.240 --> 31:56.160
Not really in the mood.

31:58.600 --> 32:00.520
Still no word?

32:02.080 --> 32:03.800
I'm sorry. You did your best.

32:05.160 --> 32:07.160
That was a pile of shite.

32:07.200 --> 32:09.720
I don't believe that.

32:09.760 --> 32:12.840
I think if anyone could have
helped him, it was you.

32:16.960 --> 32:18.880
Come with me.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.360
Why?

32:22.400 --> 32:25.360
Because a good friend of ours
is getting married today

32:25.400 --> 32:28.320
to the woman he loves and
he'd like us both to be there.

32:33.640 --> 32:36.280
Well...that's where
I'm gonna be.

32:37.920 --> 32:39.680
And I think
you need someone today

32:39.720 --> 32:41.440
so it might as well be me.

32:43.840 --> 32:44.880
Please?

32:52.160 --> 32:53.880
I'm bringing the bottle.

33:03.600 --> 33:05.520
What if she doesn't come?

33:07.000 --> 33:08.800
She'll be here, Dad.

33:08.840 --> 33:11.760
Nobody goes to this much effort
if they're not sure.

33:11.800 --> 33:13.640
Come.

33:16.360 --> 33:18.040
Stop fidgeting...

33:19.320 --> 33:21.320
..or it will take twice as long.

33:21.360 --> 33:22.960
It's itchy.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Who on earth dressed you?

33:25.040 --> 33:27.040
Believe it or not,
I did it myself.

33:28.640 --> 33:34.040
Well, we are introducing
large pins.

33:34.080 --> 33:36.120
I would advise you
to stay very still.

33:37.640 --> 33:39.360
Ruby?

33:39.400 --> 33:41.360
Real Indian women don't fidget.

33:42.560 --> 33:44.720
What, and I'm not
a real Indian woman?

33:44.760 --> 33:46.960
Of course not.
You were born in Nottingham.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.240
Last time I looked,
that was not in India.

33:51.760 --> 33:56.760
But we may be prepared
to adopt you.

33:56.800 --> 34:00.040
After a suitable time period,
and a trial.

34:00.080 --> 34:02.560
And how long is this trial,
exactly?

34:02.600 --> 34:05.200
It finishes exactly...

34:06.640 --> 34:08.120
..now.

34:09.560 --> 34:11.440
So, do I pass?

34:11.480 --> 34:13.320
With flying colours.

36:42.440 --> 36:44.360
I'm done. Time out.

36:52.720 --> 36:55.720
Hey, Dad.

36:55.760 --> 36:57.800
I don't have the stamina
for this, AJ.

36:59.520 --> 37:04.280
You know, many men,
they desire younger wives.

37:04.320 --> 37:06.320
But it's exhausting.
Don't try it.

37:10.720 --> 37:12.640
Er...Dad, I actually erm...

37:14.120 --> 37:15.960
I wanted your
professional advice.

37:17.800 --> 37:20.240
- On this.
- What's this?

37:20.280 --> 37:21.840
I've filled it out
the best I can.

37:26.400 --> 37:27.880
Medical school?

37:27.920 --> 37:29.560
I know there's room
for improvements

37:29.600 --> 37:33.200
but I just want to give myself
every chance of being accepted.

37:33.240 --> 37:35.160
I just want you
to be proud of me.

37:39.800 --> 37:41.360
You remember this.

37:41.400 --> 37:45.360
I've been proud of you ever
since the day you were born

37:45.400 --> 37:48.400
and I'm going to be proud of you
until the day I die.

37:49.240 --> 37:51.600
However...

37:51.640 --> 37:53.560
..I am going to post this
myself.

37:58.960 --> 38:01.000
My boy is going to be a doctor.

38:01.040 --> 38:02.800
Just like me.

38:21.960 --> 38:24.600
I asked for your help with Paul.

38:24.640 --> 38:26.560
I needed you
and you walked away.

38:28.960 --> 38:30.320
I'm sorry.

38:30.360 --> 38:32.880
What can I say? You're a busy
woman. Always have been.

38:32.920 --> 38:34.960
It's just something
I need to accept.

38:36.200 --> 38:39.040
What if things were to change?

38:39.080 --> 38:42.520
What if I made some time for us?

38:42.560 --> 38:44.320
That's just the drink talking.

38:44.360 --> 38:47.680
No. No, I mean it.

38:47.720 --> 38:50.920
I never thought I'd hear Dr
Lydia Fonseca say those words.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.520
I'm not sure I believe this.

39:07.960 --> 39:09.880
I thought about what you said.

39:10.920 --> 39:12.000
And?

39:12.920 --> 39:14.440
Maggie wouldn't want it.

39:15.760 --> 39:16.800
No.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.440
No, she wouldn't.

39:28.280 --> 39:30.720
- People are looking at us.
- Bollocks to 'em!

40:01.280 --> 40:02.760
Hi.

40:03.400 --> 40:04.760
Hi.

40:07.160 --> 40:09.160
Did you wear that for me?

40:09.200 --> 40:10.640
You're joking.

40:10.680 --> 40:12.360
Yes, I am.

40:12.400 --> 40:14.960
Teasing you has remained
surprisingly easy.

40:18.880 --> 40:20.800
They look happy.

40:22.760 --> 40:24.680
I think that's because they are.

40:29.640 --> 40:31.560
I'm sorry that I...

40:33.360 --> 40:35.280
..that I...

40:37.120 --> 40:39.360
That you kissed me?

40:39.400 --> 40:40.800
Yeah.

40:42.160 --> 40:43.480
Yeah.

40:45.640 --> 40:47.200
OK.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.520
Er...Mari is staring at us.

40:58.240 --> 41:00.280
I know.

41:00.320 --> 41:02.640
People clearly have
expectations.

41:03.920 --> 41:06.840
So er...what are yours?

41:11.160 --> 41:14.160
I think I'm still trying
to figure it out.

41:14.200 --> 41:16.640
And there's somewhere
I need to go to do that.

41:23.480 --> 41:26.440
So...where does that leave me?

41:36.280 --> 41:37.680
Waiting?

41:41.040 --> 41:42.440
Sorry.

41:47.560 --> 41:49.280
I can wait.

41:54.160 --> 41:55.720
Thanks.

41:57.600 --> 42:01.080
You're very um...patient.

42:01.120 --> 42:03.120
Yes, I am.

42:03.160 --> 42:04.480
Very.

42:09.080 --> 42:11.880
Come on, you two, you're needed
on the dance floor.

42:55.200 --> 42:56.640
Duty calls?

43:00.120 --> 43:02.800
I'm so sorry.

43:02.840 --> 43:05.080
- I'll drive you.
- You don't have to do that.

43:05.120 --> 43:06.560
What can I say? You're worth it.

43:06.600 --> 43:09.000
I'm worried you might still
be drunk after last night.

43:09.040 --> 43:10.680
And you're sober, are you?

43:10.720 --> 43:12.960
This liver is
a highly-trained machine.

43:13.000 --> 43:16.320
You may be a great doctor but
as a drinker you're an amateur.

43:16.360 --> 43:18.120
Am I?

43:19.760 --> 43:21.480
Worth it?

43:21.520 --> 43:23.840
Do you really need
to ask me that?

43:25.960 --> 43:28.320
When people need you,
they need you.

43:29.160 --> 43:31.160
Like I helped Paul.

43:31.200 --> 43:33.680
And without a whisker
of false modesty,

43:33.720 --> 43:35.440
I'd say I saved that man's life.

43:35.480 --> 43:38.680
Of course you did.

43:38.720 --> 43:41.640
I'm trying to tell you
that I get it.

43:41.680 --> 43:45.240
You're never gonna change,
Lydia. And I don't want you to.

43:45.280 --> 43:47.160
I'm just glad
we're still friends.

43:48.600 --> 43:50.520
We're not friends.

44:25.160 --> 44:27.080
Ruby!

44:28.280 --> 44:30.200
Dad, Ruby's here.

44:34.360 --> 44:35.640
Hi.

45:05.560 --> 45:07.880
- Is that the hernia patient?
- Yes, Dr Fonseca.

45:07.920 --> 45:10.720
Take him straight to the ward.
Swap with the Kochi transfer.

45:10.760 --> 45:12.480
Mr Rahul. Memory clinic.

45:12.520 --> 45:14.720
I'm sure Sister Mari
will be happy to help.

45:14.760 --> 45:17.680
Do you remember the way?
Don't worry, I'll help you.

45:17.720 --> 45:19.320
Mr Thampi?

45:19.360 --> 45:21.800
He's a regular.
Three mins maximum

45:21.840 --> 45:24.520
unless you enjoy a dissertation
on the prostate gland.

45:24.560 --> 45:26.480
I'll bear that in mind.
Come, sir.

45:27.240 --> 45:29.080
Mrs Pillai?

45:29.120 --> 45:31.200
Welcome to
the Good Karma Hospital.

45:31.240 --> 45:34.040
- Thank you, Doctor.
- What seems to be the problem?

45:35.305 --> 45:41.508
