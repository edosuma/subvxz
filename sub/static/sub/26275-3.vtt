WEBVTT

00:04.146 --> 00:05.348
CHUCK:
Okay.

00:05.382 --> 00:07.417
I got it. Oh, no, no, no.

00:07.450 --> 00:09.085
But is it safe with me?

00:09.118 --> 00:11.421
What am I gonna do?
Make a big announcement?

00:12.989 --> 00:15.525
Big announcement, everybody.

00:15.558 --> 00:17.627
The rumor is true.

00:17.660 --> 00:21.130
Arvo Industries just bought
Ted's Tackle Box.

00:21.163 --> 00:22.765
-(all groaning)
-That means we're next.

00:22.799 --> 00:24.601
What's gonna keep them
from buying us?

00:24.634 --> 00:26.102
Okay, but calm down, Joe.

00:26.135 --> 00:27.537
Hey, I have cats, okay?

00:27.570 --> 00:29.639
They need sweaters.
They're hairless.

00:29.672 --> 00:31.908
-You guys hear about Ted's?
-Yes!

00:31.941 --> 00:34.110
How does Arvo have
that much money?

00:34.143 --> 00:36.313
They make linoleum
and baby food.

00:36.346 --> 00:39.749
You know, the peach is
surprisingly tangy. I...

00:39.782 --> 00:41.818
Arvo is laying off 30%
of Ted's staff.

00:41.851 --> 00:44.086
-It's a bloodbath over there.
-(people groaning, sighing)

00:44.120 --> 00:46.589
My friend works at Ted's.
He's got three cats.

00:46.623 --> 00:49.726
He just invested
in a claw tower.

00:49.759 --> 00:52.562
-Hey, there's Mike. Mike?
-(loud, overlapping chatter)

00:52.595 --> 00:55.298
You know, and I was afraid
I was gonna walk into a panic.

00:55.332 --> 00:57.567
The entire kitchen staff
is freaking out,

00:57.600 --> 00:59.436
and they all have knives.

00:59.469 --> 01:00.970
Hey, where's Kyle?

01:01.003 --> 01:02.572
He comes in with you.

01:02.605 --> 01:04.474
He's been fired, hasn't he?
It's happening, people!

01:04.507 --> 01:06.175
It's happening already!

01:06.208 --> 01:08.177
All right, all right, calm down.
Nothing's happening.

01:08.210 --> 01:09.979
Kyle took a personal day off.

01:10.012 --> 01:13.149
Look, Arvo Industries can smash
Ted's Tackle Box all they want.

01:13.182 --> 01:14.951
They can't smash this store.

01:14.984 --> 01:16.419
You understand that?

01:16.453 --> 01:18.421
I'm not worried.

01:18.455 --> 01:19.989
Don't be worried.

01:20.022 --> 01:21.424
Come on!

01:21.458 --> 01:23.526
Back to work.

01:23.560 --> 01:25.261
(Kristin sighs)

01:25.294 --> 01:26.996
Thanks, Dad.
We all needed to hear that.

01:27.029 --> 01:29.031
Yeah.
I think we're screwed.

01:31.067 --> 01:33.069
*

01:37.907 --> 01:39.509
You think we're screwed?

01:39.542 --> 01:41.644
You just told everybody
that things are gonna be okay.

01:41.678 --> 01:43.179
Because I didn't want everybody
freaking out.

01:43.212 --> 01:44.881
That's what a good boss does.

01:44.914 --> 01:46.883
Sometimes you have to tell
people stuff they want to hear.

01:46.916 --> 01:48.317
That's a nice jacket,
by the way.

01:48.351 --> 01:50.453
Oh. Thank you.

01:50.487 --> 01:52.622
Wait.

01:52.655 --> 01:54.991
So, what's the plan, Baxter?

01:55.024 --> 01:57.560
Arvo bought Ted's Tackle Box
'cause Ted refuses to grow.

01:57.594 --> 01:59.996
I have a plan here
to expand Outdoor Man

02:00.029 --> 02:03.165
so we can take advantage
of the economies of scale.

02:03.199 --> 02:04.634
Wow. This looks great.

02:04.667 --> 02:06.403
What are we waiting for?

02:06.436 --> 02:10.540
Well, there's an obstacle--
old, grumpy and hates change.

02:10.573 --> 02:13.476
Is it you?

02:13.510 --> 02:15.745
Old and grumpy,
but I like change.

02:15.778 --> 02:17.213
Like, maybe eliminating
your job.

02:17.246 --> 02:18.681
How about that?

02:18.715 --> 02:20.917
He's talking about Ed.

02:20.950 --> 02:23.520
I want to expand five stores,
you know, and upgrade them,

02:23.553 --> 02:25.187
turn them
into marketing showcases.

02:25.221 --> 02:26.389
So what's Ed's problem?

02:26.423 --> 02:27.924
Well...
he is majority owner, right?

02:27.957 --> 02:30.259
So for 30 years,
I've had to always take him

02:30.292 --> 02:31.661
kicking and screaming
towards change.

02:31.694 --> 02:33.496
It's kind of, like,
our little dance.

02:33.530 --> 02:35.264
(chuckles) I can't
picture you dancing, Baxter.

02:35.297 --> 02:37.400
What do you do? Put your left
foot in and shake it all about?

02:37.434 --> 02:38.435
Floss?

02:40.870 --> 02:42.739
-Does Ed know about Arvo?
-Probably not,

02:42.772 --> 02:44.173
'cause he's fishing right now.

02:44.206 --> 02:45.708
-Oh.
-Well, call him.

02:45.742 --> 02:47.343
Uh, he's probably fishing
up in his favorite spot

02:47.376 --> 02:48.878
at Idaho Springs.

02:48.911 --> 02:50.680
There's no cell service
on the river, so,

02:50.713 --> 02:53.115
if we want to talk to him, we'd
have to drive up there, so...

02:53.149 --> 02:55.217
-Not it!
-Not it.
-Oh.

02:55.251 --> 02:57.253
Damn it. I hate this game.

02:59.321 --> 03:01.257
Listen, I was in Mandy
and Kyle's room,

03:01.290 --> 03:03.092
and I was looking
under the bed.

03:04.627 --> 03:07.697
I found these. Look. "Aunt."

03:07.730 --> 03:10.767
(laughs softly)
"Uncle."

03:10.800 --> 03:13.269
And... (giggling)

03:17.006 --> 03:18.908
You know what this means, right?

03:18.941 --> 03:21.744
Uh... Kyle made shirts

03:21.778 --> 03:24.180
to keep track
of who's who in the family?

03:25.414 --> 03:27.049
No. No, no. These are for us.

03:27.083 --> 03:28.951
No. This is...
this is how they're announcing

03:28.985 --> 03:30.620
they're having a baby.

03:30.653 --> 03:32.088
Hmm. That's really clever.

03:32.121 --> 03:34.223
That's how I know
that's not what it is.

03:34.256 --> 03:35.992
MANDY:
We're back!

03:36.025 --> 03:39.762
-Hide the loot.
-Yeah.

03:39.796 --> 03:42.665
-Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Oh.
-What?

03:42.699 --> 03:44.967
Hey, you guys.
Where'd you get that, Eve?

03:45.001 --> 03:47.737
What T-shirts?

03:47.770 --> 03:49.839
Mom snooped.

03:49.872 --> 03:52.241
Kyle, I thought
you were gonna hide these.

03:52.274 --> 03:56.445
I did. Under the bed, in a box
marked "nothing in here."

03:57.947 --> 04:00.449
Look, honey, I am so happy
for you. (laughs)

04:00.483 --> 04:01.818
-Oh!
-Oh. Mom. Mom, Mom.

04:01.851 --> 04:03.586
I'm not pregnant.

04:03.620 --> 04:05.988
Uh, Kyle jumped the gun
on the T-shirts.

04:06.022 --> 04:07.824
Oh. O-Okay. All right.

04:07.857 --> 04:10.026
Well, um,
so-so maybe you're trying.

04:10.059 --> 04:12.094
Like crazy.

04:12.128 --> 04:13.830
-Ew!
-MANDY: Kyle!

04:13.863 --> 04:15.632
Uh, sorry. Sorry, sorry.

04:15.665 --> 04:18.668
I meant... we're mating.

04:18.701 --> 04:20.302
Boundaries, Kyle.

04:20.336 --> 04:22.605
I eat in here.

04:22.639 --> 04:24.306
She is such a child.

04:24.340 --> 04:26.375
People have sex.

04:31.881 --> 04:33.883
-Hey, Mrs. B?
-Mm?

04:33.916 --> 04:35.718
How long should it take?

04:35.752 --> 04:38.320
Oh, uh, well,
it's different for everybody.

04:38.354 --> 04:40.056
I mean, there's no set time.

04:40.089 --> 04:42.792
-It's already been,
like, three months.
-Mm.

04:42.825 --> 04:44.493
I'm starting
to be a little concerned

04:44.527 --> 04:47.664
it might have something
to do with my vasectomy.

04:52.034 --> 04:54.003
You, uh...

04:54.036 --> 04:57.540
you... you had-had a vasectomy?

04:57.574 --> 05:00.710
-Yeah, you want to see the scar?
-Uh, no. No.

05:00.743 --> 05:02.912
-Oh, no. It's pretty awesome.
-No, no. I...

05:02.945 --> 05:05.815
-It takes up, like,
half my belly.
-No, I... but...

05:05.848 --> 05:07.984
Your belly? What? No.

05:08.017 --> 05:10.219
Oh, Kyle. Kyle. (sighs)

05:13.590 --> 05:17.159
That's a scar
from an appendectomy.

05:17.193 --> 05:19.562
I always do that.

05:19.596 --> 05:21.598
I hate operations that rhyme.

05:21.631 --> 05:23.566
Yeah.

05:27.704 --> 05:29.505
Yeah, yeah. Well, obviously,

05:29.538 --> 05:32.441
I'm entitled to a large
compensation if I'm laid off.

05:32.474 --> 05:34.711
More if I have dependents,
right?

05:34.744 --> 05:36.112
My cats.

05:36.145 --> 05:39.548
It's my lawyer.
I'm just gonna be a minute.

05:39.582 --> 05:41.383
No, I am not gonna sue
Mike Baxter

05:41.417 --> 05:42.785
'cause the man is a prince.

05:42.819 --> 05:45.087
All right?
Good day to you, sir.

05:45.121 --> 05:47.724
-Lawyers. Hate 'em.
-Yeah.

05:47.757 --> 05:51.027
How long you been waiting
out here for me to walk out?

05:51.060 --> 05:53.630
About an hour.

05:53.663 --> 05:55.598
Do you feel it was worth it?

05:55.632 --> 05:57.133
Probably not.

05:59.568 --> 06:02.238
Mikey.
We need to talk.

06:02.271 --> 06:04.807
Damn right we do. Um...

06:04.841 --> 06:08.577
-I know about Ted's Tackle Box.
-Great.

06:08.611 --> 06:11.280
-Great. So you know
we need to do something.
-Yeah.

06:11.313 --> 06:14.150
At our size,
Outdoor Man is like a hot dog,

06:14.183 --> 06:17.754
and Arvo Industries is like
Joey Chestnut.

06:17.787 --> 06:20.089
Is that the kid
who eats all those hot dogs?

06:20.122 --> 06:21.924
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Dips them in water first?

06:21.958 --> 06:24.326
-Right.
-Why isn't that cheating?

06:24.360 --> 06:27.263
I don't know. He probably does
that so he can get more...

06:27.296 --> 06:29.465
-You know, I think
we're off track here.
-Yeah.

06:29.498 --> 06:31.133
-Sit down for a second, Ed.
-Sure.

06:31.167 --> 06:32.769
-I got to ask you a question.
-Okay. (clears throat)

06:32.802 --> 06:34.837
Did you read this proposal
I wrote up for you?

06:34.871 --> 06:37.273
-Yes. Yes, yes.
-You read all 60 pages of it?

06:37.306 --> 06:39.008
-Yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes.
-That's interesting--

06:39.041 --> 06:40.943
there's only 30 pages in there.

06:41.944 --> 06:44.313
I read it twice.

06:44.346 --> 06:47.116
Y-You've said this before.

06:47.149 --> 06:50.019
I don't see why you need me to
analyze every single pie chart.

06:50.052 --> 06:51.620
Yeah, I do,
because we're partners,

06:51.654 --> 06:53.455
you know,
like-like Ben and Jerry,

06:53.489 --> 06:56.258
if Ben did all the work
and Jerry fished all the time.

06:56.292 --> 07:00.162
You do a lot of work, but do you
ever ask me what I'm working on?

07:00.196 --> 07:01.597
-Of course I do.
-Hmm?

07:01.630 --> 07:03.032
I often walk into your office,

07:03.065 --> 07:07.103
look at you and go,
"What are you doing?"

07:07.136 --> 07:09.205
-Look, your premise is right.
-Good.

07:09.238 --> 07:11.473
If we don't do something,
we'll get swallowed up,

07:11.507 --> 07:13.976
but why is that a bad idea?

07:14.010 --> 07:15.511
What do you mean?

07:15.544 --> 07:18.614
I've just returned
from a private lodge

07:18.647 --> 07:20.883
on a beautiful lake in Wyoming.

07:20.917 --> 07:22.719
Trout the size of your arm.

07:22.752 --> 07:24.987
Guess who invited me.

07:25.021 --> 07:26.723
-Wild guess?
-Hmm.

07:26.756 --> 07:28.791
Arvo Industries,
or some wacky billionaire

07:28.825 --> 07:30.659
hunting you for sport.

07:30.693 --> 07:34.630
They want to buy Outdoor Man,
Mikey. (clears throat)

07:34.663 --> 07:36.966
And you said no.

07:36.999 --> 07:38.968
Well, you said it yourself--

07:39.001 --> 07:41.203
they're Joey Chestnut,
we're the soggy dog.

07:41.237 --> 07:43.205
We have to sell, Mikey.

07:43.239 --> 07:45.407
No, no, no,
We do not have to sell. Ed?

07:45.441 --> 07:48.644
Ed. Ed, hold on a second. Ed.

07:48.677 --> 07:51.080
What the hell, man?

07:51.113 --> 07:54.050
You-you sent me
to Idaho Springs.

07:54.083 --> 07:55.651
Yeah.

07:55.684 --> 07:58.054
(chuckles)

07:59.221 --> 08:00.890
Turn-Turns out...

08:00.923 --> 08:02.892
-he was actually in Wyoming.
-Uh-huh.

08:02.925 --> 08:05.862
Ah. You know what is
on that river?

08:05.895 --> 08:08.530
A lot of old, bald white guys.

08:10.900 --> 08:14.036
And they can run.
(sighs)

08:19.742 --> 08:22.444
(on TV): Hey, Mike Baxter here
for Outdoor Man.

08:22.478 --> 08:23.445
I'm sitting here,
thinking about

08:23.479 --> 08:25.581
my least favorite phrases.

08:25.614 --> 08:29.852
Top of my list:
"Good government."

08:29.886 --> 08:32.955
Actually, a hilarious oxymoron.

08:32.989 --> 08:35.391
But today,
it's this nugget a boss drops

08:35.424 --> 08:38.394
right before
he becomes your former boss.

08:38.427 --> 08:40.696
"It's not personal.
It's business."

08:40.729 --> 08:42.398
Well, I promise you,

08:42.431 --> 08:44.733
it's personal
to the dude losing his job.

08:44.767 --> 08:47.203
I guarantee he'd rather
you hated him personally

08:47.236 --> 08:49.571
but he get to keep his job,
instead of hearing,

08:49.605 --> 08:51.073
(chuckling):
"Gary, you're a swell guy.

08:51.107 --> 08:53.742
"Now pack your crap
and beat it.

08:53.776 --> 08:55.912
"That job you poured your heart
and soul into--

08:55.945 --> 08:57.446
"we've given it to a robot.

08:57.479 --> 08:59.748
"And you know what we don't
have to give the robot?

08:59.782 --> 09:03.219
"Money.
But don't take it personally.

09:03.252 --> 09:04.954
"After you train
your replacement

09:04.987 --> 09:07.489
"in China how to run this
lathe, you're out on your ass.

09:07.523 --> 09:09.826
"But don't take it personally.

09:09.859 --> 09:11.994
"The money your family relies
on for food and clothes--

09:12.028 --> 09:15.264
"we're gonna spread that
around India.

09:15.297 --> 09:17.133
But don't take it personally."

09:17.166 --> 09:19.135
Well, here
at this American business,

09:19.168 --> 09:20.970
it's about the workers.

09:21.003 --> 09:23.439
We're not breaking faith with
those workers who built it.

09:23.472 --> 09:26.508
Yes, it's about workers. I said
"workers" three or four times.

09:26.542 --> 09:28.945
Now, before you go raising the
hammer and sickle and saying,

09:28.978 --> 09:31.147
"What, are you channeling
Bernie Sanders?," I promise

09:31.180 --> 09:34.083
I'm willing to pass or fail
in the free market system,

09:34.116 --> 09:36.518
but my coworkers are my family.

09:36.552 --> 09:38.187
It's called "Outdoor Man," not

09:38.220 --> 09:40.089
"Outdoor Spreadsheet"
or "Outdoor Revenue."

09:40.122 --> 09:42.191
Great outdoor goods
made by people,

09:42.224 --> 09:44.293
sold by people to people.

09:44.326 --> 09:47.196
However, if your Labrador
can operate it safely,

09:47.229 --> 09:49.731
I'll sell him a crossbow.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.635
Great job, Mike.
They're gonna love it.

09:53.669 --> 09:56.005
It's not for them.
It's for you.

09:56.038 --> 09:57.974
Follow me.

10:00.142 --> 10:02.278
-(knocking)
-Hey, honey.

10:02.311 --> 10:04.213
-Hey, Mom.
-Hey.

10:04.246 --> 10:07.049
Ooh, busy, busy, busy.
(laughs)

10:07.083 --> 10:11.320
Yeah. I, um,
was talking to Kyle earlier.

10:11.353 --> 10:13.956
God, he seems pretty excited
about starting a family.

10:13.990 --> 10:16.959
Yeah, Kyle's really eager
to be a dad.

10:16.993 --> 10:19.996
He's already been online looking
at pediatricians.

10:20.029 --> 10:21.697
Well, that is important.

10:21.730 --> 10:23.799
Mostly, he wants one
with a bow tie.

10:23.832 --> 10:25.801
(Vanessa laughs)

10:25.834 --> 10:29.338
Well, I just think it's great
that you want to have a baby.

10:29.371 --> 10:32.008
Sure.

10:32.041 --> 10:34.210
S-Sure?

10:34.243 --> 10:37.379
No, I didn't mean "sure"
as in "kind of."

10:37.413 --> 10:40.849
I meant "sure" as in...
"Yay, baby."

10:43.519 --> 10:46.889
And I mean, "I'm not buying it"
as in "I'm not buying it."

10:46.923 --> 10:49.091
I'm just worried
this isn't the right time.

10:49.125 --> 10:51.260
I'm-I'm putting a lot of work
into my business.

10:51.293 --> 10:52.995
Kyle just started his new job.

10:53.029 --> 10:55.932
And, like, no pediatricians
still wear bow ties.

10:55.965 --> 10:57.766
(sighs)
All right. Wait, wait, wait.

10:57.799 --> 11:00.502
Listen, listen, listen. Listen.

11:00.536 --> 11:03.372
As much as I can't wait
to be a grandma again,

11:03.405 --> 11:06.208
you waiting until you're ready
is more important.

11:06.242 --> 11:09.878
Look, your-your life changes
big-time when you become a mom.

11:09.912 --> 11:12.114
Beautifully.

11:12.148 --> 11:13.849
But big-time.

11:13.882 --> 11:17.053
What if I'm not as good
at it as you?

11:17.086 --> 11:19.288
Oh, stop, stop.
Come on, you will be.

11:19.321 --> 11:23.125
You will be,
but when you are ready.

11:26.728 --> 11:28.464
Wait.

11:28.497 --> 11:30.732
If you feel that way,
then why are you trying?

11:30.766 --> 11:32.935
I'm sort of not.

11:35.171 --> 11:37.273
I mean, I know
the best times to try,

11:37.306 --> 11:40.109
and I've been avoiding them.

11:40.142 --> 11:42.111
Well, is that fair to Kyle?

11:42.144 --> 11:44.380
No, it's okay. We...
(laughing): We more than make up

11:44.413 --> 11:45.781
-for it other times.
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

11:45.814 --> 11:48.150
No. No, no, no, no.

11:48.184 --> 11:51.487
Um, honey, it's okay
if you feel that way,

11:51.520 --> 11:53.956
but-but, really,
you need to tell your husband.

11:53.990 --> 11:56.292
Do I?

11:56.325 --> 11:57.626
Mandy.

11:57.659 --> 11:58.927
It's not like I'm lying to him.

11:58.961 --> 12:00.296
I'm just not telling him
the truth.

12:00.329 --> 12:01.397
Mandy.

12:01.430 --> 12:02.999
Fine. Fine. I'll stop lying.

12:04.533 --> 12:07.203
-Mandy.
-Fine.

12:09.838 --> 12:11.940
I just want
to show you something

12:11.974 --> 12:16.778
that I forgot to put in that
proposal that you didn't read.

12:16.812 --> 12:18.914
Now, listen, I'm sure you don't
know who that is.

12:18.947 --> 12:21.683
ED:
Uh, that's Connor
from Fishing Gear.

12:21.717 --> 12:24.520
Yeah, well, his wife, she, uh,
his wife, um...

12:24.553 --> 12:26.255
Liz. Liz. They just had a kid,
remember?

12:26.288 --> 12:27.990
Of course they did.
Beautiful little girl.

12:28.024 --> 12:30.159
That's not exactly what I want
to show you, though.

12:30.192 --> 12:32.194
-Yeah.
-What I want to show you is...

12:32.228 --> 12:33.962
-Mm-hmm.
-...over there.

12:33.996 --> 12:35.531
-That-that woman there.
She, um...
-ED: Yeah.

12:35.564 --> 12:37.333
Leslie. We just went

12:37.366 --> 12:38.767
to her housewarming party
last month.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.836
-I gave her a toaster.
-Right.

12:40.869 --> 12:44.506
Richest guy in the room
gave her a toaster.

12:44.540 --> 12:47.176
Okay. All right.
(chuckles)

12:47.209 --> 12:49.445
I get where you're going
with this, Mike.

12:49.478 --> 12:51.480
-Uh, think so?
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

12:51.513 --> 12:53.649
They're not just, uh,
numbers on a spreadsheet,

12:53.682 --> 12:55.117
they're people, hmm?

12:55.151 --> 12:57.053
They're-they're our people,
right?

12:57.086 --> 13:00.289
And if we sell, our people
will be taken care of.

13:00.322 --> 13:02.324
But for how long? I mean,
I think Connor wants

13:02.358 --> 13:04.626
to keep that kid for a while.
Same with Leslie and her house.

13:04.660 --> 13:07.796
Despite the toaster fire.

13:07.829 --> 13:09.465
But if Arvo buys Outdoor Man,

13:09.498 --> 13:11.233
they're still gonna need
our people.

13:11.267 --> 13:13.035
Yeah? Why don't you tell that
to all the people

13:13.069 --> 13:15.437
just laid off from
Ted's Tackle Box?

13:19.941 --> 13:22.211
Yeah, well...

13:22.244 --> 13:24.580
you're right, Mike.

13:24.613 --> 13:27.049
I can't throw these people
to the wolves.

13:27.083 --> 13:28.750
So we're not gonna sell.

13:28.784 --> 13:30.386
Won't sell.

13:30.419 --> 13:32.488
Now it's time we took a look
at my proposal.

13:32.521 --> 13:36.592
Actually, I have a proposal
of my own: I'm gonna retire.

13:36.625 --> 13:38.327
-(chuckles)
-Yeah.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.662
From what?

13:40.696 --> 13:42.831
It's time you took
the reins, Mike.

13:42.864 --> 13:46.168
Yes, you said yourself,
you don't need me anymore.

13:46.202 --> 13:47.169
Come on.

13:47.203 --> 13:48.937
You know, this...

13:48.970 --> 13:51.607
this is why I hate doing
the hokeypokey.

13:55.644 --> 13:58.114
VANESSA:
Wow. So Ed just quit?

13:58.147 --> 14:00.449
That's what he said.

14:00.482 --> 14:02.518
Well, I'm sure that's hard
for him, but, you know,

14:02.551 --> 14:05.221
he knows what's best
for himself.

14:05.254 --> 14:07.923
Really? Three marriages,
no prenups?

14:07.956 --> 14:10.859
And I'm supposed to trust
his judgment?

14:10.892 --> 14:12.394
Well, I don't know, maybe
he just feels like it's time

14:12.428 --> 14:13.795
to try something else.

14:13.829 --> 14:15.797
Trust me, within a week,

14:15.831 --> 14:19.301
he'll be going crazy without me
being around to bust his balls.

14:19.335 --> 14:21.303
Will he?

14:25.307 --> 14:29.278
What'd you mean by that?

14:29.311 --> 14:31.046
Look, Mike, I...

14:31.079 --> 14:32.914
-You like to kid around a lot.
-Mm-hmm.

14:32.948 --> 14:34.250
A-And I know
you're just trying

14:34.283 --> 14:35.584
to be funny with people.

14:35.617 --> 14:38.620
Trying to be funny?

14:38.654 --> 14:40.422
A lot of people use my jokes.

14:40.456 --> 14:42.724
I've heard them.

14:42.758 --> 14:45.827
Well, I'm just saying
that some people--

14:45.861 --> 14:47.663
I mean, not me or the kids

14:47.696 --> 14:49.965
or, you know,
that waiter from last night--

14:49.998 --> 14:52.901
-(chuckles)
-but some people might think

14:52.934 --> 14:56.172
you were saying what you
actually felt.

14:56.205 --> 14:59.441
That's ridiculous. What kind
of moron would think that?

14:59.475 --> 15:01.810
So maybe you give Ed
the impression

15:01.843 --> 15:04.346
that he's not that important
to you anymore.

15:04.380 --> 15:06.348
-I don't do that.
-All right, well,

15:06.382 --> 15:08.350
what did you say to him when he
came back from the fishing trip?

15:08.384 --> 15:11.787
I said something nice.
I compared us to Ben and Jerry.

15:11.820 --> 15:14.690
A cat and mouse?

15:14.723 --> 15:18.360
That would be Tom and Jerry.

15:18.394 --> 15:21.930
(laughing): Oh.
Oh, right, yeah.

15:21.963 --> 15:24.766
Well, look,
if-if you want Ed to stay,

15:24.800 --> 15:26.835
then maybe you should tell him
how important he is to you.

15:26.868 --> 15:31.240
Perfect. Give us something to
talk about while we're spooning.

15:34.210 --> 15:35.711
(gasps) Kyle.

15:35.744 --> 15:37.246
There you are.

15:38.814 --> 15:40.782
What's wrong?

15:40.816 --> 15:42.984
(exhales) Bad day.

15:43.018 --> 15:45.521
I know something
that'll cheer you up.

15:45.554 --> 15:48.224
A kiss from your turtle.

15:48.257 --> 15:50.326
Turtle kiss.

15:51.493 --> 15:53.061
(laughs)

15:53.094 --> 15:55.697
There's my happy hubby.

15:55.731 --> 15:58.367
Yeah, well, it's hard to be sad
when you're a turtle.

16:00.001 --> 16:02.838
You know, honey, if...
if you're still worried

16:02.871 --> 16:04.706
because we haven't been able
to get pregnant yet,

16:04.740 --> 16:07.376
I think I can make you
feel better.

16:07.409 --> 16:09.978
No. You can't.

16:10.011 --> 16:11.913
I went to the doctor.

16:11.947 --> 16:14.416
You're not still worried
about the vasectomy, are you?

16:14.450 --> 16:17.519
I told you that is
a kidney thing.

16:19.521 --> 16:21.690
No, I already had
the appointment.

16:21.723 --> 16:25.261
But while I was there,
I... had my sperm counted.

16:25.294 --> 16:27.162
They can do that?

16:27.195 --> 16:29.765
It seems like they'd be hard
to catch.

16:29.798 --> 16:32.834
Yeah, I-I don't know
how they do it.

16:32.868 --> 16:34.536
But they did.

16:34.570 --> 16:37.138
And mine is low.

16:39.408 --> 16:41.577
Sorry I let you down.

16:41.610 --> 16:44.680
Oh, honey, you-you didn't.

16:44.713 --> 16:46.348
Look,

16:46.382 --> 16:49.117
the truth is...

16:49.150 --> 16:52.854
I'm not sure I want
to have a baby yet.

16:52.888 --> 16:54.456
You don't?

16:54.490 --> 16:56.725
No.

16:56.758 --> 16:59.428
So maybe it's a good thing
we have to wait.

16:59.461 --> 17:01.297
(sighs)
Wow.

17:03.499 --> 17:06.568
How lucky am I?

17:08.437 --> 17:11.072
You love me so much,
you'd make up this lie

17:11.106 --> 17:12.641
just to make me feel better.

17:12.674 --> 17:15.043
No, no. I'm not lying.

17:15.076 --> 17:17.112
I have serious doubts
this is the right time.

17:17.145 --> 17:20.148
How do you get dressed in the
morning with those angel wings?

17:20.181 --> 17:22.884
Kyle, listen to me,
I am telling the truth.

17:22.918 --> 17:26.788
Then I'm gonna tell you
the truth. I hate you.

17:26.822 --> 17:28.724
-I'm doing your lying thing,
-Oh.

17:28.757 --> 17:31.627
-You got that, right?
-Yeah.

17:31.660 --> 17:33.562
You're just not gonna
believe me, are you?

17:33.595 --> 17:35.431
No. But I appreciate it.

17:35.464 --> 17:37.132
And we still have hope.

17:37.165 --> 17:39.668
The-the doctor suggested things
to help boost my numbers.

17:39.701 --> 17:42.471
-Like what?
-Well...

17:42.504 --> 17:45.474
I have to start wearing
boxer shorts.

17:45.507 --> 17:48.176
And eating superfoods.

17:48.209 --> 17:50.078
Oh, and...

17:50.111 --> 17:52.781
I might have to give up
the unicycle.

17:56.652 --> 17:58.587
MIKE:
Ed.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.255
What are you doing?

18:00.288 --> 18:01.923
Packing up, Mikey.

18:01.957 --> 18:04.125
Oh, yes, and I'm leaving you
my-my copy

18:04.159 --> 18:06.595
of Laughs for the Lavatory.

18:06.628 --> 18:08.997
From what I understand,
it's in poor taste now.

18:09.030 --> 18:10.932
Put that stuff back.

18:10.966 --> 18:13.335
You're not gonna want to leave
after you see this.

18:13.369 --> 18:15.804
-The hell is that?
-It's the first commercial

18:15.837 --> 18:17.473
we ever did together on,
literally,

18:17.506 --> 18:20.141
the last VCR in America.

18:20.175 --> 18:24.212
Come on. Oh, man.

18:24.245 --> 18:28.116
*

18:28.149 --> 18:29.685
Hello, I'm Mike Baxter.

18:29.718 --> 18:32.020
Hey, actually that's my line.

18:32.053 --> 18:34.456
(chuckles) That's right.
And this is my line.

18:34.490 --> 18:36.224
And my hook and sinker.
Mm-hmm.

18:36.257 --> 18:38.460
That's right. This is wh...
this is the Bull Taylor

18:38.494 --> 18:40.028
-rod and reel.
-Mm-hmm. Yup.

18:40.061 --> 18:41.697
Available exclusively at...

18:41.730 --> 18:45.000
BOTH (echoing):
Outdoor Man.

18:45.033 --> 18:46.802
-Mm-hmm.
-You don't have to be in Miami

18:46.835 --> 18:49.304
-to enjoy this vice.
-Ooh.

18:49.337 --> 18:52.641
Ah. (chuckles)

18:52.674 --> 18:55.043
If you don't get it here,
you don't get it.

18:55.076 --> 18:59.047
-Get it? (chuckles)
-Get it.

18:59.080 --> 19:00.816
We were idiots.
All right, what's the point?

19:00.849 --> 19:02.250
The-the point is
look at those two idiots.

19:02.283 --> 19:03.719
They're having a great time.

19:03.752 --> 19:05.721
Yeah, we were a good team, huh?

19:05.754 --> 19:07.489
What do you mean?
We're still a good team.

19:07.523 --> 19:09.858
Outdoor Man works
because we work.

19:09.891 --> 19:12.093
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

19:12.127 --> 19:15.196
The only thing in my life
that ever did.

19:15.230 --> 19:18.166
Okay, look, if I've ever
made fun of you

19:18.199 --> 19:20.836
in a joke or two... dozen,

19:20.869 --> 19:23.104
-I-I'm sorry.
-Yeah, I see,

19:23.138 --> 19:24.873
I see what you're saying--
so you think I'm a crybaby

19:24.906 --> 19:27.609
because I can't take a joke,
huh? Please.

19:27.643 --> 19:31.046
I sat in the front row
at a Rickles show.

19:31.079 --> 19:32.948
Okay, so what is it?

19:32.981 --> 19:34.550
-It's time, Mike.
-For what?

19:34.583 --> 19:36.251
That's all. Here. It-It's time.

19:36.284 --> 19:37.953
Come on, I've worked my ass off
my whole life.

19:37.986 --> 19:39.387
I-I didn't stay
in this kind of shape

19:39.421 --> 19:40.856
so I could sit behind my desk

19:40.889 --> 19:42.691
for-for another 30 years.

19:42.724 --> 19:44.760
I-I want to enjoy the time
I've got left, that's all.

19:44.793 --> 19:46.695
(chuckles) Well, if you last
another 30 years,

19:46.728 --> 19:48.797
you won't be enjoying it,
I'll tell you that.

19:48.830 --> 19:52.100
Listen, wh-why are you making
this so hard?

19:52.133 --> 19:53.935
Wh-Why don't you let me leave?

19:53.969 --> 19:58.139
We-Well, we, you know,
we got to, um...

19:58.173 --> 20:00.408
We, you know, there...

20:00.442 --> 20:02.210
We have the... Let me...

20:02.243 --> 20:04.880
All right, um,
let me help you here, okay?

20:04.913 --> 20:07.215
You've lost a lot lately.
Haven't you?

20:07.248 --> 20:09.084
Hmm? You know, Mike.

20:09.117 --> 20:12.654
Your girls are growing up.
Your father passed away.

20:12.688 --> 20:15.190
And now you don't want to lose
your best friend.

20:20.529 --> 20:22.430
I'm gonna miss you, man.

20:24.500 --> 20:26.835
Okay. I'll miss you, too.

20:26.868 --> 20:29.738
Yeah.

20:29.771 --> 20:32.674
Here. I don't have a VCR.

20:41.116 --> 20:43.752
-CHUCK: There he is!
-(applause)

20:43.785 --> 20:46.655
-The man who saved our jobs.
-All right, all right.

20:46.688 --> 20:48.624
When you do right,
we got to give it up.

20:48.657 --> 20:50.425
And, look, my cats are smiling,
and not just 'cause

20:50.458 --> 20:52.427
-they killed a lizard.
Check that out.
-Oh.

20:52.460 --> 20:56.532
Well, this, uh, new era is gonna
be great for all of us.

20:56.565 --> 20:58.967
But we'll all have to do
some more work.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.435
-How's that, now?
-Hmm?

21:00.468 --> 21:03.171
Well, I want all the stores
to be up to Denver standards.

21:03.204 --> 21:05.641
All department heads--
we're gonna need proposals,

21:05.674 --> 21:07.943
budgets, training manuals.

21:07.976 --> 21:09.711
That sounds like a lot of work.
(laughs)

21:09.745 --> 21:12.113
You clearly just said
"some" more work.

21:12.147 --> 21:13.949
Well, this is a big job.

21:13.982 --> 21:15.884
That means extra work.

21:15.917 --> 21:17.986
That means late nights.
Weekends.

21:18.019 --> 21:20.488
Oh, during football season.

21:20.522 --> 21:23.559
(laughs): Oh, man. I'm all
for expansion, Baxter,

21:23.592 --> 21:27.195
but we don't have to take over
the whole damn world.

21:27.228 --> 21:29.898
Well, a lot of people
at Ted's Tackle Box

21:29.931 --> 21:31.466
are looking for work
right about now.

21:31.499 --> 21:33.635
Look, I can't do it all,
everybody.

21:33.669 --> 21:36.738
Come on, let's get to work.
Come on, let's do it.

21:38.273 --> 21:39.741
(chicken clucking)

21:39.775 --> 21:41.777
