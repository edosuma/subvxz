WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:05.366
It is 6:00 a.m.,
and Deangelo and I
are about to go house to house

00:05.439 --> 00:08.068
to give everybody
their Dundies
nomination certificate.

00:08.141 --> 00:09.973
Just like the Oscars.
Yes.

00:10.043 --> 00:11.602
And this happens every year?

00:11.678 --> 00:13.544
Every year this happens.
Okay. Every year.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.708
You have a lot
to learn, my friend.

00:16.717 --> 00:18.481
Well, you know,
why don't we try it,

00:18.552 --> 00:21.112
and if it goes good,
it'll be part of my tradition.

00:21.188 --> 00:23.817
Why are you even saying that?
You're going to love it.

00:24.591 --> 00:26.287
Here we go.

00:27.961 --> 00:29.589
This way, this way.

00:32.332 --> 00:33.960
Okay.
Nice house.

00:34.601 --> 00:36.194
Surprise!
Congratulations!

00:36.270 --> 00:37.363
Yep.

00:37.671 --> 00:41.369
You and Pam have
both been nominated
for Dundie Awards.

00:41.608 --> 00:42.598
Okay.

00:44.511 --> 00:46.241
MICHAEL: Have Pam come down.
No, no, she's not here.

00:46.413 --> 00:47.437
PAM: What's going on?

00:47.581 --> 00:48.605
Stay in bed.

00:48.916 --> 00:50.578
Congratulations!
Stanley, we love you.

00:50.684 --> 00:54.678
Have you lost your mind?
Get off my property
before I call the police.

00:56.223 --> 00:57.589
All right, we got it. Good.
Okay.

00:57.691 --> 00:58.681
Leave it at the door? Okay.

00:58.759 --> 00:59.783
Yeah, that's fine.

01:06.533 --> 01:07.967
Hey, Toby, you suck!

01:09.836 --> 01:11.099
Is this an employee of ours?

01:12.673 --> 01:14.335
Why are...
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:14.808 --> 01:17.141
I've never seen this
place in the daylight.

01:17.277 --> 01:19.610
This reminds me
of Katrina.

01:21.181 --> 01:24.015
Here we go.
All right.

01:24.084 --> 01:27.452
Got it? Are we set? Hello?

01:29.389 --> 01:30.413
Oh.
Uh-oh.

01:30.490 --> 01:32.925
I'm so busted. Walk of shame.

01:33.527 --> 01:35.928
Do you usually leave
your door unlocked?
And ajar?

01:37.497 --> 01:39.659
Nice. I got
a Dundie nomination. Wow.

01:39.733 --> 01:41.292
Yes, that's right.
Yes, you did.

01:41.368 --> 01:43.337
No big deal.
Congratulations, Meredith.

01:43.403 --> 01:44.803
Well, we should head out.

01:44.871 --> 01:46.066
No, no, no,
you've got to stay.

01:46.139 --> 01:48.836
No, no, no, I have
Vienna sausages
and I have napkins.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.878
Let me fix you breakfast.

01:56.950 --> 01:57.974
 Go.

02:13.233 --> 02:14.326
Good morning, Erin.

02:14.468 --> 02:15.595
Oh, hey, didn't see you.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.031
Any big plans for tonight?

02:17.104 --> 02:18.163
I don't know.

02:18.238 --> 02:21.231
Maybe volunteer at
the women's shelter,
go to bed.

02:21.441 --> 02:23.000
Or, I don't know,

02:23.443 --> 02:26.242
maybe I'm going
to the Dundies!

02:27.948 --> 02:30.713
You are getting
so funny. Very good.

02:32.252 --> 02:35.586
The Dundies are my baby,
and they need to go on.

02:38.525 --> 02:41.359
When Larry King died,
they didn't just
cancel his show.

02:41.428 --> 02:44.887
They got Pierce Morgan
to come in and do his show,

02:44.965 --> 02:48.026
and that way, Larry lives on.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.696
Anything can happen
at the Dundies.

02:53.874 --> 02:56.173
They're like
the Golden Globes,
but less mean.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.209
And I just want us to
all have a good time.

02:58.278 --> 02:59.644
Just a little
announcement, folks.

02:59.713 --> 03:02.182
Remember, the Dundies
is a black tie affair.

03:02.582 --> 03:04.016
Black tie optional.

03:04.451 --> 03:06.352
Every day is
black tie optional.

03:06.420 --> 03:10.084
FYI, tonight we will
be hosting at Louie Volpe's.

03:10.157 --> 03:11.750
Nice.
I love their breadsticks.

03:11.825 --> 03:13.418
Oh, their breadsticks
are like crack.

03:13.560 --> 03:15.119
I love when
people say "like crack"

03:15.195 --> 03:16.823
who've obviously
never done crack.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.931
Well, the breadsticks
are like what then, Ryan?

03:18.999 --> 03:20.900
What can I use?
I don't know.
Something from your world.

03:20.967 --> 03:22.526
"The breadsticks are
like scrapbooking."

03:22.602 --> 03:24.798
You're right, you're right.
No, I'm a middle-class fraud.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.430
MICHAEL: Shh.
Okay, okay, okay.

03:26.506 --> 03:29.806
Everybody's right.
They're like
breadsticks on steroids.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.435
Right?
Yeah, that's great.

03:31.678 --> 03:33.738
So, as you know,
the Dundies are my legacy,

03:33.814 --> 03:35.544
so I'm going to need
to train a replacement.

03:35.615 --> 03:38.278
So this year,
I have decided
to have a co-host.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.748
And that person is

03:43.557 --> 03:45.082
Deangelo!

03:46.827 --> 03:49.422
Always the Padawan,
never the Jedi.

03:49.796 --> 03:53.494
Thank you, Michael.
Uh, but I will have to pass.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.062
Think of it as
part of your training.

03:56.136 --> 03:57.570
I'm not much
of a performer.

03:57.637 --> 03:59.265
Unless you count
singing in the shower.

04:01.441 --> 04:02.909
Boy, okay.

04:03.477 --> 04:05.309
Okay, well, we'll work on it.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.673
 Look,
I'm very, very bad.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.216
Very bad.
You are doing it.

04:09.282 --> 04:11.808
Guys, I want you to help us
work on some banter.

04:12.052 --> 04:13.850
Yes! I love banter.

04:13.920 --> 04:14.910
Good.

04:14.988 --> 04:17.184
But I hate witty banter.
MICHAEL: Here we go.

04:18.225 --> 04:21.524
So, Deangelo, you and I
have a lot in common.

04:21.728 --> 04:25.893
You lost 200 pounds,
and I lose my car
keys every morning.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.195
That is true. We do
share some similarities.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.933
I know how we can fix
one of those problems.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.338
For me, it was
portion control.

04:34.407 --> 04:36.239
For you, you need a keychain.

04:37.344 --> 04:38.869
Maybe hang them on the...
Okay, okay, you know what?

04:38.945 --> 04:40.379
I didn't actually
lose my keys.

04:40.647 --> 04:41.671
Okay, so this
did not happen.

04:41.815 --> 04:42.839
M'kay.

04:42.916 --> 04:46.045
There needs to be
what you call a "rat-tat-tat."

04:46.186 --> 04:48.678
And right now,
it's all "rat" and no "tat."

04:48.755 --> 04:49.848
Ryan, come on up here.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.516
Deangelo, if you'd just...
Do you mind?

04:51.591 --> 04:53.526
Tap Deangelo out.
Because if I can see it.

04:53.593 --> 04:54.788
Just watch this. Okay.

04:55.762 --> 04:56.957
Ryan, how are you today?

04:57.030 --> 04:58.191
Why don't you
ask my therapist?

04:58.331 --> 04:59.526
My mom certainly
pays her enough.

04:59.599 --> 05:02.000
There you go! Lovely!

05:02.269 --> 05:04.500
<i>Regis and Kelly.</i> Nice.

05:04.571 --> 05:07.166
Use that as an inspiration.
Just be funny.

05:07.908 --> 05:10.434
Uh... You, sir.
Are we having fun tonight?

05:10.677 --> 05:12.270
Having a great time.
Thanks, yeah.
Oh, good.

05:12.679 --> 05:13.908
Where were you
on September 11th?

05:13.980 --> 05:16.040
No, gosh. No, no.

05:16.283 --> 05:18.081
MICHAEL: Stop, stop.
DEANGELO: This is so weird.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.450
If I'm conducting a meeting,
good to go.

05:20.520 --> 05:23.786
But if I think of
it as a performance,
I fall apart, obviously.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.649
Why don't you think
of hosting the Dundies

05:25.792 --> 05:27.317
like you're just
running a meeting?

05:27.394 --> 05:30.489
No, no, no, this is
the performance of your life.

05:30.730 --> 05:33.723
Why don't you just privately,
in your own head,
think of it like a meeting?

05:33.867 --> 05:35.927
Jim, please, no loopholes.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.334
Mike, why do you
have to control

05:37.470 --> 05:38.802
how he perceives
it in his mind?

05:38.905 --> 05:40.931
This is my last Dundies ever.

05:41.007 --> 05:44.944
If I want mind control
over him, is that
too much to ask?

05:49.182 --> 05:51.811
Good. Good, good. Good.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.513
Now, tell me
something terrible

05:53.587 --> 05:54.782
that happened in
your childhood.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.984
When I was very young,
my mother divorced my father

05:58.058 --> 06:00.289
and I had to go to court
and choose between them.

06:00.393 --> 06:03.227
Too personal.
I don't want to
hear about that stuff.

06:03.296 --> 06:04.821
Let's try this. Put this on.

06:06.132 --> 06:10.661
I am going to turn this on
and turn the volume
all the way up,

06:11.705 --> 06:15.005
so you can't... That's right,
you're not going to be
able to hear yourself.

06:15.075 --> 06:17.840
Read this, and it's
going to sound perfect.

06:17.911 --> 06:21.313
 "The Dundies are all
about coming together,

06:21.915 --> 06:26.376
"and recognizing
the indomitability
of the human spirit!"

06:26.453 --> 06:27.978
Say it with an accent!

06:28.121 --> 06:29.646
The Dundies!

06:29.856 --> 06:31.825
"The Dundies!"
 The Dundies!

06:31.892 --> 06:33.360
I just don't
understand the desire

06:33.493 --> 06:34.961
to push sweet
potato fries on me.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.052
I just want regular fries.

06:36.129 --> 06:37.119
Yeah.

06:37.530 --> 06:38.520
Oh!

06:40.433 --> 06:42.061
PAM: Hey, Erin,
everything okay?

06:42.202 --> 06:43.670
Get away from the car,
or he's going to see you.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.066
Who's going to see us?

06:45.205 --> 06:46.434
Just get in.
Get in. Just get in.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.734
JIM: Get in the car?

06:49.242 --> 06:51.905
Please, sorry,
get in.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.311
I'm sorry,
sorry, sorry.

06:54.381 --> 06:55.644
What's wrong?

06:55.882 --> 06:58.283
I eat lunch in the car now.
It's my alone time.

06:59.552 --> 07:01.714
It's just nice
to have some time
away from Gabe.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.989
Why don't you
want to each lunch
with your boyfriend?

07:04.057 --> 07:06.788
I really don't like
spending time with him.

07:07.460 --> 07:09.429
Don't you think it's better
to tell him the truth now?

07:09.629 --> 07:11.860
You know,
rather than waste
more of his time?

07:15.835 --> 07:17.701
I think I'm going to go.
What?

07:17.771 --> 07:19.399
I think you got this.
Okay.

07:19.472 --> 07:21.065
Okay? All right.
Yeah.

07:21.141 --> 07:22.837
Okay. Thank you, Jim.
Feel better.

07:23.209 --> 07:26.646
I'm sorry, that just
wasn't interesting to me.

07:28.348 --> 07:30.510
I can't just dump him, Pam.
I'm not like you.

07:30.583 --> 07:31.915
I can't be mean.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.248
Wait, when am I...

07:34.487 --> 07:37.013
You just have to be
clear and firm, you know.

07:37.090 --> 07:40.549
Just tell him
you don't love him.
Just be honest with him.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.929
Hi.
Appalling.

07:46.866 --> 07:48.425
Eyesore.

07:49.402 --> 07:50.893
Surprisingly adequate.

07:51.604 --> 07:55.803
Okay, everyone,
the festivities
commence in four seconds!

07:56.609 --> 07:58.771
<i>Deangelo,</i>
<i>Jo's on the phone for you.</i>

07:59.679 --> 08:00.806
<i>Hello?</i>

08:00.880 --> 08:03.475
<i>Deangelo, we're in</i>
<i>serious horse manure here.</i>

08:03.550 --> 08:06.076
<i>The Dundies are tonight,</i>
<i>and we ain't got no host.</i>

08:06.252 --> 08:07.652
<i>Oh, no.</i>

08:07.721 --> 08:09.622
<i>Luckily, I have</i>
<i>someone for you.</i>

08:09.956 --> 08:11.117
<i>Billy Crystal?</i>
<i>Better.</i>

08:11.424 --> 08:12.483
<i>Neil Patrick Harris?</i>

08:12.559 --> 08:14.824
<i>He's in</i> Little Shop
of Horrors <i>on Broadway.</i>

08:14.894 --> 08:16.726
<i>Right.</i>
<i>No, we need</i>
<i>Michael Scott,</i>

08:16.796 --> 08:20.665
<i>the best darn Dundies host</i>
<i>both sides of the Mississippi.</i>

08:22.702 --> 08:24.967
I've got to
find Michael Scott.

08:25.939 --> 08:29.603
And then I've got to
get him to the Dundies.

08:30.710 --> 08:32.804
Hey, can you help me
find Michael Scott, Angela?

08:33.446 --> 08:36.712
My boyfriend can.
He's a state senator.

08:36.783 --> 08:37.807
Mmm-hmm.

08:37.884 --> 08:41.150
Oh, no, he can't help
because that title
has no meaning.

08:42.455 --> 08:44.219
Try Jim, Deangelo.
He'll be able to help.

08:44.324 --> 08:45.519
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.

08:45.959 --> 08:48.861
Jim, do you know
where I can
find Michael Scott?

08:49.295 --> 08:52.754
Oh, I totally don't know
where Michael is, dude.

08:52.832 --> 08:54.926
Hey, you want to
listen to some records?

08:55.301 --> 08:57.668
No one's listening to me.
I'm running out of time.

08:57.737 --> 09:00.935
Well, what are you
talking about?

09:04.844 --> 09:07.143
I've fallen
and I can't get up.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.944
Maybe I just need to
look into my heart.

09:10.016 --> 09:13.145
Deangelo,
where is Michael Scott?

09:13.219 --> 09:15.848
I'm here.
In a good way.

09:15.922 --> 09:17.288
I've been here
the whole time.

09:18.191 --> 09:21.923
The analytical part of
me wants to examine it.

09:21.995 --> 09:23.793
But I know it has no content.

09:23.963 --> 09:26.057
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>please stand up</i>

09:26.132 --> 09:27.828
<i>for your</i>
<i>co-host of the evening,</i>

09:27.901 --> 09:29.267
<i>Michael Gary Scott!</i>

09:31.838 --> 09:37.072
<i>Please remain standing</i>
<i>for your other co-host</i>
<i>and new manager,</i>

09:37.143 --> 09:42.172
<i>Deangelo Jeremetrius Vickers!</i>

09:49.689 --> 09:51.021
DWIGHT: <i>Is that part of the...</i>

09:56.029 --> 09:57.657
Deangelo. Hey.

09:58.998 --> 10:01.331
Deangelo, what are you doing?
There's a live
audience out there.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.768
Just go do it by yourself,
or get Ryan.

10:03.870 --> 10:06.032
No, Ryan would never do it.
It's too on the radar.

10:06.139 --> 10:11.442
Look, look,
the boss hosts the Dundies.
It's sort of our perk.

10:11.578 --> 10:14.241
This was not part of
the job description.

10:14.347 --> 10:15.406
Okay, listen to me.

10:15.482 --> 10:17.610
You're not doing this for me,
you're not doing this for you.

10:17.684 --> 10:19.118
You're not even
doing this for them.

10:19.185 --> 10:21.177
What am I doing it for?

10:21.621 --> 10:23.351
You're doing it for
all those kids out there

10:23.490 --> 10:25.220
eating off
the Louie Volpe's kids menu

10:25.291 --> 10:27.260
who are wondering,
"Does it get better?"

10:27.727 --> 10:29.719
What I want you to do is,
I want you to say,

10:29.863 --> 10:31.889
"It's show time."
And get out there.

10:32.765 --> 10:35.257
I can't.
Say it.

10:35.502 --> 10:36.834
Stop hitting me.

10:36.903 --> 10:38.235
You can do it,
just say it.

10:39.038 --> 10:40.165
Hit me again.

10:40.840 --> 10:41.967
Now hit me.

10:43.843 --> 10:44.970
One, two, three...

10:45.044 --> 10:46.068
It's show time!
It's show time!

10:46.146 --> 10:48.240
All right, here we go.

10:52.919 --> 10:55.411
Okay, okay,
sorry about the delay,
everybody,

10:55.488 --> 10:58.788
<i>but we were at</i>
<i>the DMV waiting in line.</i>

11:00.627 --> 11:03.756
<i>Fall asleep right after sex.</i>
<i>Huh, guys?</i>

11:04.597 --> 11:05.963
Nope, go back to the script.

11:06.065 --> 11:09.229
<i>There are a lot</i>
<i>of great salesmen</i>
<i>in this office,</i>

11:09.402 --> 11:13.396
<i>but one of our great salesmen</i>
<i>is also a great dad,</i>

11:13.873 --> 11:15.899
<i>and a close</i>
<i>personal friend of mine.</i>

11:15.975 --> 11:19.104
<i>Jim Halpert, Best Dad Dundie.</i>

11:24.150 --> 11:26.051
<i>Wow, I do not</i>
<i>parent for the awards,</i>

11:26.186 --> 11:28.121
<i>but I got to tell you,</i>
<i>it feels pretty good.</i>

11:28.655 --> 11:31.523
<i>Cece, if you're</i>
<i>watching this at home,</i>
<i>it's way past your bedtime.</i>

11:31.591 --> 11:34.584
<i>By the way,</i>
<i>how'd this get</i>
<i>televised? Thanks.</i>

11:34.661 --> 11:35.856
<i>Well done.</i>

11:35.929 --> 11:37.192
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>maybe being a good dad</i>

11:37.330 --> 11:38.593
<i>is just following</i>
<i>your own compass.</i>

11:38.665 --> 11:40.861
<i>I don't know, I don't know.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
Okay.

11:44.170 --> 11:45.160
Didn't think to
mention me, huh?

11:45.238 --> 11:46.228
Didn't I?

11:46.439 --> 11:49.876
<i>Which moves us to</i>
<i>Best Mom Dundie.</i>

11:50.043 --> 11:52.012
<i>This person, well,</i>
<i>I guess we all sort of</i>

11:52.145 --> 11:54.137
<i>consider a mom</i>
<i>around the office,</i>

11:54.214 --> 11:55.512
<i>Meredith Palmer!</i>

11:56.182 --> 11:57.582
Oh, my God!

11:57.650 --> 11:59.118
WOMAN: Say what?

12:05.058 --> 12:07.527
<i>I'll tell you one thing,</i>
<i>I'm not going to be</i>
<i>a good mom tonight.</i>

12:07.594 --> 12:08.687
Whoo!

12:08.761 --> 12:11.993
<i>Excuse me, can I get a photo</i>
<i>of the best mom and</i>
<i>the best dad, please?</i>

12:12.932 --> 12:13.991
<i>Step on up.</i>

12:14.067 --> 12:15.057
I've got to go do this.

12:15.134 --> 12:16.124
Why?

12:17.103 --> 12:19.072
Let's go, big smiles, folks.
There they are.

12:19.172 --> 12:22.631
<i>Year after year,</i>
<i>I catch a lot of flak</i>
<i>on this particular award</i>

12:22.709 --> 12:26.737
<i>because year after year,</i>
<i>I present this award</i>
<i>to a guy instead of a girl.</i>

12:26.813 --> 12:31.148
<i>Hottest in the Office</i>
<i>goes to Danny Cordray!</i>

12:31.884 --> 12:33.785
<i>Danny could not</i>
<i>be here tonight...</i>

12:33.853 --> 12:35.287
How do I feel
about not winning

12:35.421 --> 12:36.889
Hottest in
the Office this year?

12:36.956 --> 12:38.754
Um, I'm very relieved.

12:38.825 --> 12:41.954
How do you judge
something like...
What is his criteria, even?

12:42.028 --> 12:43.018
It's...

12:43.696 --> 12:44.857
It's so subjective.

12:44.931 --> 12:48.299
<i>Stanley Hudson is a grump,</i>
<i>everybody knows that.</i>

12:48.534 --> 12:50.935
<i>But did you know</i>
<i>that Stanley Hudson</i>

12:51.004 --> 12:54.497
<i>is also the face of</i>
<i>a debilitating disease</i>
<i>known as diabetes?</i>

12:56.476 --> 13:00.072
<i>The Diabetes Award</i>
<i>goes to Stanley Hudson!</i>

13:00.847 --> 13:03.180
<i>Come on up here,</i>
<i>you sick bastard.</i>

13:05.451 --> 13:09.354
I have diabetes, too.
You don't see me
making a big deal about it.

13:09.689 --> 13:12.955
<i>They say he's going to be</i>
<i>my right-hand man,</i>

13:13.026 --> 13:15.928
<i>ad-lib masturbation joke. No.</i>

13:16.429 --> 13:18.557
<i>I hate this.</i>
<i>I hate it so much.</i>

13:18.631 --> 13:23.331
<i>Dwight Schrute,</i>
<i>please accept this Promising</i>
<i>Assistant Manager Dundie.</i>

13:25.138 --> 13:29.007
<i>Thank you, thanks so much.</i>
<i>Um, I want to</i>
<i>dedicate this award</i>

13:29.075 --> 13:33.240
<i>to something that, uh,</i>
<i>we take for granted</i>
<i>in our daily lives,</i>

13:33.313 --> 13:34.872
<i>and that is</i>
<i>the humble trash can.</i>

13:35.214 --> 13:37.342
<i>This is for you, trash can.</i>

13:44.857 --> 13:46.155
Who gave you those crayons?

13:46.225 --> 13:48.023
I brought them from home.

13:48.194 --> 13:49.389
Do you have a red?

13:49.529 --> 13:50.758
This is a cloth tablecloth.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.264
You can't color on it.

13:52.565 --> 13:54.227
Oh, really?

13:54.367 --> 13:59.806
<i>Did you know herpes affects</i>
<i>one out of every five</i>
<i>sexually active adults?</i>

14:00.907 --> 14:02.273
<i>Pippi Longstocking,</i>

14:02.342 --> 14:06.109
<i>Ronald McDonald's wife,</i>
<i>Ron Howard, Ron Weasley.</i>

14:06.179 --> 14:08.580
<i>What do they all have</i>
<i>in common? Redheads.</i>

14:09.215 --> 14:10.444
<i>And, Erin Hannon,</i>

14:11.250 --> 14:15.415
<i>come on up here to receive</i>
<i>your Cutest Redhead</i>
<i>in the Office award.</i>

14:15.922 --> 14:17.413
That is bull.

14:20.560 --> 14:23.359
Thank you,
thank you,
thank you.

14:24.163 --> 14:26.496
<i>This is the first</i>
<i>award I've ever won</i>
<i>in my entire life.</i>

14:28.067 --> 14:31.595
<i>People were right</i>
<i>about the Dundies,</i>
<i>they are magical.</i>

14:33.206 --> 14:35.437
<i>But I don't feel it,</i>

14:35.508 --> 14:38.569
<i>and I think that's because</i>
<i>I'm not with the right person.</i>

14:39.045 --> 14:40.240
<i>Gabe...</i>

14:41.080 --> 14:42.070
GABE: What?

14:42.148 --> 14:43.138
<i>We should break up.</i>

14:44.117 --> 14:45.210
What?

14:45.451 --> 14:47.044
<i>I'm not attracted to you.</i>

14:48.955 --> 14:51.686
<i>I just...</i>
<i>I cringe when you talk.</i>

14:52.058 --> 14:54.618
<i>I have to be honest.</i>

14:54.694 --> 14:56.219
<i>Right, Pam?</i>

14:59.932 --> 15:01.730
<i>Thank you for hearing me.</i>

15:03.503 --> 15:05.938
<i>Okay, well,</i>
<i>this is embarrassing.</i>

15:07.006 --> 15:09.100
<i>Obviously</i>
<i>really angry at Erin.</i>

15:09.175 --> 15:12.407
<i>Here comes that</i>
<i>quarter-life crisis</i>
<i>everyone's talking about.</i>

15:15.214 --> 15:16.648
<i>All right, I'm gonna go.</i>

15:18.351 --> 15:20.786
Let's... There you go.

15:21.487 --> 15:22.853
Damn, that was cold.

15:24.123 --> 15:27.753
<i>It is difficult to</i>
<i>recognize the person</i>
<i>who will be replacing you.</i>

15:28.628 --> 15:29.926
<i>But he is a good guy,</i>

15:29.996 --> 15:34.366
<i>so the Michael Scott Award</i>
<i>for Best Dundies Host</i>

15:34.567 --> 15:36.331
<i>goes to Deangelo Vickers.</i>

15:44.777 --> 15:45.767
ALL: Speech, speech, speech...

15:45.845 --> 15:46.835
Speech, speech, speech...

15:48.748 --> 15:50.546
Hold on, hold on one second.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.217
Crank it.

15:57.256 --> 16:01.591
 <i>I want to...</i>
<i>I feel truly blessed</i>
<i>to be working with all of you.</i>

16:01.661 --> 16:04.529
<i>You know,</i>
<i>before this all started,</i>
<i>funny story,</i>

16:04.597 --> 16:08.534
<i>I was in the bathroom,</i>
<i>vomiting and vomiting</i>
<i>in that men's room.</i>

16:08.601 --> 16:10.331
Okay.
<i>That's why it has</i>
<i>been shut down...</i>

16:10.403 --> 16:11.598
That's it.
<i>... for most of the evening.</i>

16:11.671 --> 16:13.663
This is important.
He's expressing himself.

16:13.739 --> 16:14.934
<i>Hosts don't get Dundies.</i>
No.

16:15.007 --> 16:17.067
<i>This is truly special for me,</i>

16:17.143 --> 16:20.409
and, anyway,
it's so much lighter.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.381
MICHAEL: Okay,
we're done. That's it.
What?

16:22.448 --> 16:23.677
Michael, are we... What?

16:23.749 --> 16:24.910
We're done, we're done.

16:27.119 --> 16:30.920
So, that is how it ends.
My last Dundies ever.

16:33.693 --> 16:36.561
I was hoping it would be
more like <i>Godfather III,</i>

16:36.629 --> 16:39.064
that wrapped up
the whole franchise

16:39.198 --> 16:41.667
in an extremely
satisfying way,

16:42.401 --> 16:44.961
but instead,
it is like <i>Godfather I,</i>

16:45.705 --> 16:48.573
that was very confusing,

16:49.709 --> 16:52.042
had maybe three big laughs.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.105
Oh, well.

16:54.180 --> 16:55.204
PAM: Hey, Michael?

16:55.781 --> 16:58.216
We were thinking
maybe we could
keep this thing going.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.247
What?

17:00.386 --> 17:01.615
I know I'm the cause
of this royal screwup,

17:01.687 --> 17:03.246
but I would like to
see the show go on.

17:03.322 --> 17:05.290
No, don't. You're
being too hard on yourself.

17:05.424 --> 17:07.415
We had a very
truncated rehearsal time.

17:07.492 --> 17:09.358
Let's grab some
ice cream, go back

17:09.428 --> 17:11.226
to the office,
and finish what we started.

17:11.897 --> 17:13.924
So what you're saying is,
you kind of liked it?

17:14.000 --> 17:15.525
"I've fallen,
and I can't get up."

17:16.636 --> 17:18.366
That Phyllis bit.
That was pretty good, right?

17:18.436 --> 17:20.429
I don't know that
we need to dissect it all
right now, but it...

17:20.506 --> 17:21.666
That got a big laugh.
It did.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.266
That actually got a big laugh.
Pretty huge laugh.

17:23.342 --> 17:25.003
You were laughing, right?
I was.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.612
Oh, you know what?
I have to go to the bathroom.

17:27.680 --> 17:28.739
Don't worry,
we're really close.

17:28.814 --> 17:30.749
Really, you know, I can just
run over to
the gas station there.

17:30.816 --> 17:32.011
We should just
wait here and not get

17:32.151 --> 17:33.380
good seats in
the conference room?

17:33.452 --> 17:35.216
That's true, we
wouldn't get seats together.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.649
Okay, yeah, I'll hold it.
I'm fine.

17:37.723 --> 17:41.455
You know,
despite a couple of hiccups,
I thought that went very well.

17:41.527 --> 17:44.429
I thought it was
the worst Dundies
I've ever been to.

17:44.597 --> 17:48.034
Man! Maybe you should have won
the Kind of a Bitch Award.

17:48.701 --> 17:53.162
Gladly. I'd accept that award,
because a bitch
is a female dog.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.399
What? What are
you doing?
Aah!

17:56.509 --> 17:57.499
What...
Ooh!

17:58.144 --> 18:01.012
Please don't stop
so suddenly. Seatbelt's
pressing on my bladder.

18:01.180 --> 18:02.443
Why are you even
wearing a seatbelt?

18:02.515 --> 18:03.847
You're sitting in
the backseat, baby.

18:03.916 --> 18:04.975
What is your problem?

18:05.051 --> 18:07.384
I just don't see the point
of the Dundies, okay?

18:07.453 --> 18:10.150
The jokes are terrible,
the venue was bad,
the fashion was boring.

18:10.222 --> 18:14.489
Okay, that is unfair.
The clothing was
safe but tasteful.

18:14.660 --> 18:16.720
And next time,
why don't you pick a co-host

18:16.862 --> 18:18.922
that doesn't have
microphone-a-phobia?

18:18.998 --> 18:20.830
Look, whatever
you're going to do,

18:20.967 --> 18:22.799
how long is it
going to take, ballpark?

18:22.868 --> 18:25.337
Because I just...
I've got to make
a decision here.

18:29.375 --> 18:31.640
He is in
an all-out sprint.

18:32.745 --> 18:34.407
...better than before.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.209
Please, excuse me.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.648
Here... Okay.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.710
By his own admission,
this person

18:40.853 --> 18:42.845
actually tried
marijuana in college,

18:43.122 --> 18:47.287
so the Doobie Doobie Pothead
Stoner of the Year Award

18:47.360 --> 18:49.920
goes to Andy Bernard!

18:50.930 --> 18:52.023
Yes.

18:52.298 --> 18:53.288
Ohhh!

18:53.933 --> 18:55.458
There's a lot of
people I'd like to thank,

18:55.534 --> 18:58.003
but I think we
all actually want
to thank you, Michael.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.139
Oh! Thank you.

19:00.206 --> 19:03.802
I mean, we actually really
all want to thank
you for everything.

19:08.114 --> 19:09.878
Oh, my God.
Something's happening.

19:12.485 --> 19:16.513
<i>9,986,000 minutes</i>

19:17.289 --> 19:20.555
<i>We actually sat</i>
<i>down and did the math</i>

19:21.994 --> 19:25.795
<i>9,986,000 minutes</i>

19:26.666 --> 19:30.296
<i>That's how many minutes</i>
<i>that you've worked here</i>

19:30.770 --> 19:31.760
<i>In costumes</i>

19:31.837 --> 19:32.827
<i>And impressions</i>

19:33.172 --> 19:34.401
<i>In meetings</i>

19:34.540 --> 19:35.769
<i>In cups of coffee</i>

19:36.042 --> 19:37.032
<i>For birthdays</i>

19:37.176 --> 19:38.200
<i>More meetings and...</i>

19:38.277 --> 19:40.439
<i>E-mail forwards</i>
<i>you made us read</i>

19:40.880 --> 19:45.079
<i>9,986,000 minutes</i>

19:45.584 --> 19:49.578
<i>That's like watching</i>
Die Hard <i>80,000 times</i>

19:49.722 --> 19:51.953
<i>You hit me with your car</i>

19:52.091 --> 19:54.322
<i>You helped me get off drugs</i>

19:54.593 --> 19:56.755
<i>I watch you when you sleep</i>

19:56.829 --> 19:58.764
<i>I forgive you for kissing me</i>

19:58.998 --> 20:02.127
<i>Remember to call</i>

20:02.268 --> 20:04.203
<i>You've got to remember to call</i>

20:04.270 --> 20:06.830
<i>Remember to call</i>

20:07.039 --> 20:09.338
<i>Love is a gift from up above</i>

20:09.408 --> 20:11.138
<i>Remember to call</i>

20:11.210 --> 20:14.009
<i>Text or call or e-mail or call</i>

20:14.680 --> 20:20.745
<i>Measure,</i>
<i>measure your life in love</i>

20:22.221 --> 20:24.588
<i>Remember to call</i>

20:24.724 --> 20:27.125
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

20:27.193 --> 20:29.185
<i>Remember to call</i>

20:29.261 --> 20:32.425
<i>Yeah, yeah, you've</i>
<i>got to remember to call</i>

20:32.498 --> 20:35.662
<i>Remember to call</i>

20:39.205 --> 20:41.197
Yeah, okay.

20:43.375 --> 20:46.539
Well, this is going to
hurt like a mother .

20:48.447 --> 20:50.177
<i>Every day,</i>
<i>millions of Americans</i>

20:50.316 --> 20:52.046
<i>suffer from</i>
<i>extreme repulsiveness.</i>

20:52.118 --> 20:55.680
<i>Someone in our midst</i>
<i>is bringing that</i>
<i>problem to light.</i>

20:55.755 --> 20:57.917
<i>Toby Flenderson,</i>
<i>please come up here</i>

20:57.990 --> 21:00.118
<i>and accept</i>
<i>the Extreme</i>
<i>Repulsiveness Award.</i>

21:00.226 --> 21:01.216
<i>Oh, that's so mean.</i>

21:01.293 --> 21:02.283
<i>No, it's fine.</i>

21:03.796 --> 21:04.923
You got to play along, man.

21:04.997 --> 21:07.228
Come on, Toby.

21:07.299 --> 21:08.528
<i>Here he comes!</i>

21:09.235 --> 21:11.534
<i>All right, you deserved it.</i>

21:11.604 --> 21:15.132
<i>I really disagree with this.</i>
<i>I think it's kind of hateful.</i>

21:15.307 --> 21:16.798
<i>Although,</i>
<i>I am a little happy right now</i>

21:16.876 --> 21:19.175
<i>to have</i>
<i>a platform to talk about</i>
<i>the outcome of a case</i>

21:19.245 --> 21:21.646
<i>that I was</i>
<i>recently a juror on,</i>
<i>the Scranton Strangler.</i>

21:21.814 --> 21:25.478
<i>A man's being put to death,</i>
<i>I was part of the verdict,</i>

21:25.551 --> 21:27.645
<i>and I'm not so sure</i>
<i>he's guilty anymore.</i>
