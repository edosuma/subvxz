And who is Debbie?

01:19.425 --> 01:22.227
She's organizing my 25-year
high school reunion.

01:22.228 --> 01:24.429
Why does that make you
so angry? Dish, girl.

01:24.463 --> 01:26.564
Because she wants my high school
band to play there,

01:26.565 --> 01:28.700
and I don't want to be
humiliated all over again!

01:28.734 --> 01:30.268
Right. Your reunion.

Are we not going?

I want to go now.

Oh, thank God!
I'm confused.

01:36.909 --> 01:38.443
Why wouldn't they get
the other band?

01:38.477 --> 01:40.278
You know, the one that
totally dominated you guys

01:40.279 --> 01:41.646
at the talent show?

01:41.647 --> 01:43.047
What were they called?

01:43.082 --> 01:44.616
Bad Hair Day?
Aah!

Don't you speak those words

If you must know, Louise,

01:51.056 --> 01:52.724
we were not
Debbie's first choice

01:52.758 --> 01:54.659
or second or third.

01:54.660 --> 01:56.094
I think her exact words were,

01:56.095 --> 01:57.762
"I am desperate
and out of ideas."

01:57.763 --> 01:59.631
Eh, I wouldn't read
too much into that.

01:59.665 --> 02:01.132
Mom, time-out.
This is your big chance.

the head. See you in a bit!

07:58.145 --> 08:00.113
Linda, you're here.
Hello, Debbie.

08:00.114 --> 08:03.183
Well, I tried to be a good
organizer, I did, but I-I...

08:03.184 --> 08:05.151
yeah, I couldn't get
Bad Hair Day.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.420
Da-da-da. You're not gonna
regret this, Debbie!

08:07.421 --> 08:08.755
No. I mean, I think
I will, but...

08:08.789 --> 08:10.523
♪ 'Cause we're here to rock!

08:10.524 --> 08:12.358
♪ I'm gonna be like Carrie
up on the stage! ♪

08:12.359 --> 08:13.593
But hopefully less blood.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.128
Um, did you say "Carrie"?

08:15.129 --> 08:16.629
Yep. ♪ Bye, Debbie.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.798

08:22.002 --> 08:23.670
Whoa! (laughs)

08:23.671 --> 08:25.505
Hello, handsome.

08:25.539 --> 08:27.307
JEN:
<i>I spy</i>

08:27.308 --> 08:29.709
with my little eye
something brown.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.144
Is it a babysitter
who stabbed

08:31.145 --> 08:32.511
a fellow babysitter
in the back?

08:32.513 --> 08:33.947
Huh? Huh? Is it?
Uh, no.

08:33.948 --> 08:35.347
It's the couch.
Oh.

08:35.349 --> 08:36.816
Yeah, that is brown.

08:36.817 --> 08:38.952
Um, uh, I'm gonna go...

08:38.953 --> 08:41.821
check the pantry,
not look for Shim Shams. Bye.

08:41.822 --> 08:45.024
Come on! We should
be at the reunion!

08:45.025 --> 08:47.026
Watching the train wreck
of all train wrecks!

08:47.027 --> 08:49.062
Come on, Jen, buddy,
you got a car, right?

08:49.063 --> 08:50.296
You got a license.

08:50.331 --> 08:51.698
You like adventure, huh?

08:51.699 --> 08:53.199
You want to please
us, right, huh?

08:53.234 --> 08:54.801
What do you say we drop in?

08:54.802 --> 08:56.636
Just one quick drink,
we're out of there.

08:56.637 --> 08:59.873
Oh, Jen, think how many things
you could spy at that reunion.

08:59.874 --> 09:03.877
Green things, purple things,
bright things, dark things!

09:03.878 --> 09:06.746
Come on, Jen!
I spy reunions!

09:06.747 --> 09:09.582
Um, I'm really trying to honor
your mom's instructions.

09:09.583 --> 09:11.684
"I'm really trying to honor
your mom's instructions."

09:11.685 --> 09:13.519
(whispering):
I'm mocking you.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.388
Listen, whatever she's
paying you, I'll double it,

09:15.389 --> 09:17.991
then divide it by ten.
No, no, 20.

09:17.992 --> 09:19.525
No. Where are the Shim Shams, Jen?!

09:19.526 --> 09:21.561
I know you're hiding them!
Tell me!

09:21.562 --> 09:23.029
(mutters)

09:23.030 --> 09:25.265
(goofy, high-pitched yelling)

09:25.266 --> 09:26.266
Whoa.

09:26.267 --> 09:27.567
Sorry, I'm...

09:27.568 --> 09:29.535
extremely ticklish.
I'll say.

09:29.570 --> 09:31.404
Interesting.

09:31.438 --> 09:32.872
Hi. Derek Dematopolis.

09:32.873 --> 09:35.508
Oh. Hi. Uh, Bob Belcher,
Linda's husband.

09:35.509 --> 09:38.211
Your, uh, nose is about
to fall into your drink there.

09:38.212 --> 09:39.612
What?
Is that makeup?

09:39.613 --> 09:41.281
No. Uh... yeah,

09:41.282 --> 09:42.916
it is. Thanks.
Sorry about that.

09:42.917 --> 09:44.450
It's, uh, makeup.

09:44.451 --> 09:46.219
Wow, you've got quite
a pimple there.

09:46.220 --> 09:47.720
Yeah, it's pretty bad. Whoa,
whoa, what are you doing?

09:47.755 --> 09:49.355
It's okay.
I'm a dermatologist.

09:49.356 --> 09:50.757
Derek Dematopolis,
the dermatologist?

09:50.758 --> 09:52.225
Yup. Wow.
That is, uh...

09:52.226 --> 09:54.227
What?
That is really...

09:54.228 --> 09:55.895
Well, it's throbbing.
Yeah, it's been really bad for...

09:55.896 --> 09:57.363
Yeah. Does it hurt
when I do this?

09:57.364 --> 09:58.831
Ow! Yeah, it does.
That hurts a lot.

09:58.866 --> 10:00.266
Did it hurt?
Yeah.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.801
You know, Stacy works at a spa.
Hey, Stacy!

10:01.802 --> 10:03.236
Oh, no, no, I don't want
to make a big thing...

10:03.237 --> 10:04.604
Stacy!
Ugh!

10:04.605 --> 10:06.072
Hello. Oh, my God,
look at that. Yeah.

10:06.073 --> 10:07.407
(whistles) Huh? Yeah.

10:07.441 --> 10:09.142
(laughs)
That's my pimple.

10:09.143 --> 10:11.077
Phew! Bet you'd love to
get a whack at that thing.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.779
Ho, ho! You know who should see
this, though, is Tonya.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.647
BOB: No.
She might have some samples.

10:14.648 --> 10:16.082
No, come on.
She's-she's in pharmaceuticals.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.450
Yeah.
She's got the good stuff.

10:17.451 --> 10:18.885
Tonya? Yeah. Oh, my God.

10:18.886 --> 10:20.787
Get over here.
Get a load of this!

10:20.788 --> 10:22.488
Tonya. Tonya! Did-did all of
you get jobs in skin care?!

10:22.489 --> 10:24.624
No, I do hair plugs.
Here's my card. Thank you.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.626
Okay, guys.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.161
This is how we're gonna
get to the reunion.

10:28.162 --> 10:29.729
I don't know.
She seems really ticklish.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.397
It's weird.
At least she didn't fart.

10:31.398 --> 10:34.300
When I get tickled, I fart,
but that's me.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.569
Tina, the girl
took your job!

10:36.570 --> 10:40.273
Make her armpits regret it
for the rest of their lives!

10:40.274 --> 10:42.175
Hey, Jen. Hi.

10:42.176 --> 10:44.644
Hey, Louise.
Do you want to do something?

10:44.645 --> 10:46.913
I have pencils in my purse.

10:46.914 --> 10:48.348
Oh, wow.
That's fun.

10:48.349 --> 10:50.149
You know, we do want
to do something.

10:50.150 --> 10:53.019
Okay. We want you to drive
us to the reunion, Jen.

10:53.020 --> 10:56.089
And if you don't, you're gonna
get the human feather duster.

10:56.090 --> 10:57.957
That's me.
Uh...

10:57.958 --> 10:59.359
And you're also gonna

10:59.360 --> 11:00.760
tell us where
the cookies are!

11:00.761 --> 11:02.161
And you're gonna
let me eat them all

11:02.162 --> 11:03.596
and throw up
wherever I want! Aah!

11:03.630 --> 11:06.132
You probably
shouldn't tickle me.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.600
Oh, playing
hardball, huh?

11:07.601 --> 11:09.769
Tina, give her
a little taste.

11:09.770 --> 11:10.769
Oh, really, guys.

11:10.771 --> 11:11.871
(screams)

11:11.872 --> 11:12.939
Aah! Aah! Aah!

11:12.940 --> 11:14.674
Uh-oh.

11:14.708 --> 11:17.310
Hello, alumni
of Cardinal Gennaro High.

11:17.311 --> 11:19.278
I hope everyone's having
a good time,

11:19.279 --> 11:22.181
and if you're not, I'd like
to see you organize something

11:22.182 --> 11:23.649
on this budget,
in this time frame.

11:23.650 --> 11:25.284
It's been really hard.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.754
All right, we're about
to go on, so, set list.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.655
We'll start
with "We're the Ta-Ta's"

11:29.656 --> 11:32.225
and then we'll go right into
"You Were All Wrong About Us"

11:32.226 --> 11:34.660
and then
"Oh, Boy, You All Got So Fat."

11:34.695 --> 11:36.529
And then my song?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, if we have time.

11:36.530 --> 11:37.797
Everybody ready?

11:37.798 --> 11:39.165
Feel pumped?
Do you feel pumped?

11:39.166 --> 11:40.199
I feel bloated.

11:40.234 --> 11:41.801
Good... use it.

11:41.802 --> 11:42.802
So, yeah, divorce is hard.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.170
But you know what?

11:44.171 --> 11:46.205
You get up in the morning
and you... what?

11:46.206 --> 11:47.740
(gasps)
Oh, my goodness.

11:47.741 --> 11:49.675
Recent developments to announce.

11:49.676 --> 11:52.045
We thought they couldn't come,
but they're here...

11:52.046 --> 11:54.881
our very own Bad Hair Day!

11:54.915 --> 11:56.349
What?
Gah!

11:56.350 --> 11:57.950
We're back where we started.

11:57.985 --> 12:00.319
It's like the talent show
all over again, huh?

12:00.320 --> 12:02.188
First place...
took home the gold.

12:02.189 --> 12:05.358
And then our next gold
was a gold record!

12:12.166 --> 12:14.333
♪ Have a PhD

12:14.334 --> 12:16.102
(sighing)
(muttering)

12:16.103 --> 12:17.570
So, they're gonna go on
first 'cause they've got

12:17.571 --> 12:19.672
a packed stadium show
to get to, and then

12:19.706 --> 12:21.107
you can follow them.
That sound good?

12:21.108 --> 12:23.242
First the famous girl band,
then you guys.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.511
(muttering)
Great. BHD!

12:25.512 --> 12:27.046
BHD! Linda, come on,
get into it.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.581

Oh, wait, let me take
a "before" picture.

12:36.880 --> 12:37.946
I want to show someone at work.

12:37.981 --> 12:39.014
Oh, no, no, no...
Got it.

12:39.015 --> 12:40.549
Ah, okay. Oh, my
God, what's that?

12:40.550 --> 12:42.584
I should go check on
that thing I just saw.

12:42.585 --> 12:44.253
Hey, hey, where you going, where
you going, where you going?

12:44.254 --> 12:45.754

Hey, what are we

Hey, Linda,
about my song...

12:54.998 --> 12:56.899
Not now, Gayle.

12:56.900 --> 12:58.567
Do you know how
to juggle fire?

12:58.568 --> 13:01.069
What if, while I'm singing,
I throw you a torch?

13:01.070 --> 13:02.790
Oh, will you shut up
about your stupid song?

13:02.805 --> 13:03.939
Your song's out.

13:03.940 --> 13:05.107
We're not doing it.
What?

13:05.141 --> 13:06.408
You said I could sing it.

13:06.442 --> 13:07.843
Yeah, well, that was before

13:07.844 --> 13:09.745
B-Bad Hair Day showed up.

13:09.746 --> 13:11.249
Your song would
just make it worse.

13:11.281 --> 13:13.916
(gasps)
My cat was right about you.

13:13.917 --> 13:16.218
This reunion's made you nuts.

13:16.252 --> 13:17.786
I quit.
Oh, fine, quit.

13:17.787 --> 13:19.488
I'm gonna go fill
my purse with food

13:19.489 --> 13:21.757
and then write some graffiti
about you in the bathroom

13:21.758 --> 13:24.259
and then wait in the car
for you to give me a ride home.

13:24.294 --> 13:25.928
JEN:
This is bad.

13:25.929 --> 13:27.329
Babysitters aren't supposed

13:27.330 --> 13:29.598
to give kids black eyes
unless...

13:29.632 --> 13:31.433
Yeah, no, they're...
No, no, no, they're not.

13:31.434 --> 13:33.302
I'm going to get fired.
What'll I do?

13:33.303 --> 13:34.536
You'll probably have
to leave town,

13:34.537 --> 13:36.338
work on a shrimp boat,
call yourself JJ.

13:36.339 --> 13:37.606
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:37.607 --> 13:40.208
No one has to know
about this

13:40.209 --> 13:42.945
if you take us
to the reunion.

13:42.979 --> 13:45.113
But won't your parents
see the black eye?

13:45.114 --> 13:47.115
Hmm, all right,
there's only one solution.

13:47.116 --> 13:49.685
We all have to have black eyes.

13:49.719 --> 13:50.953
Jen has a black eye.

13:50.954 --> 13:52.187
Tina has a black eye.

13:52.221 --> 13:53.355
Gene has a black eye.

13:53.389 --> 13:54.523
I have a black eye.

13:54.524 --> 13:56.124
Who did it?
Nobody knows.

13:56.125 --> 13:57.659
"How'd you get your black eye?"
"I don't know."

13:57.660 --> 13:58.860
"How-How'd you get
your black eye?"

13:58.861 --> 14:00.062
"What, do I have one?"
"Yeah."

14:00.063 --> 14:02.064
Oh, my God, what happened?

14:02.065 --> 14:04.833
I guess a black eye fairy came
and kissed us all on the eye.

14:04.867 --> 14:05.866
Wait, what?

14:05.868 --> 14:07.069
But if Jen gets in trouble,

14:07.070 --> 14:08.303
I get to be babysitter again.

14:08.304 --> 14:09.638
I'm back, baby.

14:09.672 --> 14:12.307
No, no, no, Tina, Tina,
we need leverage here.

14:12.308 --> 14:13.508
(sobbing)

14:13.543 --> 14:15.544
(sighs)
Damn this big heart of mine.

14:15.545 --> 14:17.179
I guess Jen shouldn't get fired.

14:17.213 --> 14:20.248
Well, then it's time
for some punch!

14:25.154 --> 14:26.153
(cheering)

14:26.155 --> 14:27.990
Thank you, little people!

14:27.991 --> 14:29.324
We're not gonna stay and mingle!

14:29.325 --> 14:30.328
Good night!

14:31.828 --> 14:33.829
Whoo!
Good luck, Tay-tas.

14:33.830 --> 14:34.830
Ta-Ta's!

14:34.831 --> 14:36.167
Right, right, right.

14:36.199 --> 14:38.233
Give it up for Bad Hair Day.

14:38.234 --> 14:39.534
How can you top that?

14:39.535 --> 14:40.569
You can't.

14:40.570 --> 14:42.838
And next up, the Ta-Ta's.

14:44.073 --> 14:45.540
Linda, come on.

14:45.575 --> 14:47.309
Gah, dah, gah.

14:47.343 --> 14:49.945
Yeah, Ta-Ta's, whoo!

14:49.946 --> 14:51.766
Oh... drunk.

14:51.781 --> 14:52.848

14:52.849 --> 14:54.149
PATSY:
You should go out there.

14:54.183 --> 14:55.183
Linda.
Get out there.

15:14.070 --> 15:16.038
Linda,
are you okay?

15:16.072 --> 15:17.706
I'm fine, I'm fine.

15:17.740 --> 15:19.908
All right, uh, DJ?

15:21.110 --> 15:22.411
Get out here,
pizza face.

15:22.412 --> 15:23.945
Uh, no, thanks.
Ah, get out here.

15:23.946 --> 15:26.148
No, I can't,
I-I should check on my wife.

15:26.149 --> 15:27.549
Come on, it's
your night.

15:27.550 --> 15:28.817
Ha-ha,
it's not really.

15:28.818 --> 15:30.052
Ha, nah, I'm not
talking to you.

15:30.053 --> 15:31.053
I'm talking
to the pimple.

15:31.054 --> 15:32.387
Okay.

15:32.388 --> 15:33.388
(high-pitched):
"Okay, I'm coming."

15:33.389 --> 15:35.724
(sobbing)

15:39.470 --> 15:41.672
ALL: Go, pimple, go,
pimple, go, pimple.

15:41.673 --> 15:43.173
(sobbing)

15:44.475 --> 15:46.376
That stupid... nothing...

15:46.377 --> 15:49.646
Uh, Jen, we're gonna need
to hang a little U-ey.

15:49.681 --> 15:52.149
(sobbing hysterically)

15:52.183 --> 15:57.154
Hello, Mother, we'd like to give
you a ride, but you look crazy.

15:57.155 --> 15:58.555
What? Where
are you going

15:58.556 --> 15:59.990
and, and what happened
to you?

16:00.024 --> 16:01.692
We all got punched,
no one knows how,

16:01.693 --> 16:02.926
life's funny that
way. The end.

16:02.927 --> 16:04.194
I still don't
get our plan.

16:04.195 --> 16:05.996
Shush, Tina.
Gah!

16:05.997 --> 16:08.732
Anyway, Mom,
where are <i>you</i> going?

16:08.733 --> 16:10.200
Yeah, what happened
with the band?

16:10.201 --> 16:12.002
Oh, it was a disaster.

16:12.003 --> 16:14.538
Bad Dah Dah came and played
and blew everyone away.

16:14.539 --> 16:16.373
(groans)

16:16.374 --> 16:18.975
We would have been laughed off
the stage just like back then.

16:19.010 --> 16:20.110
So you left?

16:20.111 --> 16:21.945
Yeah.
You're a runaway Ta-Ta?

16:21.946 --> 16:24.548
Yeah...

16:24.549 --> 16:26.917
You look like you could use
some Shim Sham crumbs.

16:26.918 --> 16:28.418
Here you go.

16:28.419 --> 16:29.886
Oh, oh, that's good,
it makes... it's good.

16:29.921 --> 16:31.688
Linda. Linda, listen.
Huh?

16:31.689 --> 16:32.689
Linda, listen.
Wha...?

16:32.690 --> 16:33.690
Huh, what?

16:33.691 --> 16:34.891
Linda.
What, Jen?

16:34.926 --> 16:37.461
Your band is probably bad,

16:37.462 --> 16:41.131
but I don't let it bother me
that I'm not a good babysitter.

16:41.132 --> 16:43.433
I have no chemistry
with children,

16:43.434 --> 16:45.202
I don't know
how to use a "mick-rowave,"

16:45.203 --> 16:47.637
I don't know
what "bath time" means,

16:47.638 --> 16:49.439
but I do it 'cause I love it.

16:49.440 --> 16:53.610
Maybe you should think
about that.

16:53.611 --> 16:56.580
Ah...

16:56.581 --> 16:57.981
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

16:57.982 --> 16:59.883
Derek, I'm reeling you in,
buddy!

16:59.884 --> 17:01.251
(Derek and Bob laughing)

17:01.252 --> 17:02.252
It's a fish!

17:02.253 --> 17:03.420
Linda!

17:03.421 --> 17:04.588
What?
Why are the kids here?

17:04.589 --> 17:06.021
Do they all have black eyes?

17:06.057 --> 17:07.723
It's babysitter stuff,
Dad, get over it.

17:07.724 --> 17:09.626
Yeah, it's above your pay grade.

17:09.660 --> 17:12.061
Uh, okay, I want
to come back to that

17:12.063 --> 17:14.263
'cause none of what
you just said makes sense,

17:14.265 --> 17:16.633
but first I want
to talk to your mother.

17:16.634 --> 17:19.469
Lin, I know you're nervous
about going up there.

17:19.470 --> 17:21.304
I-I was nervous
about my pimple,

17:21.305 --> 17:23.272
but I was brave and
I came here anyway,

17:23.273 --> 17:25.108
and I'm having the
time of my life, so...

17:25.143 --> 17:26.576
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:26.577 --> 17:27.911
I already got the
inspirational speech from Jen.

17:27.912 --> 17:29.846
Okay? That's all
right, I'm fine.

17:29.847 --> 17:32.315
Oh, all right, well, I'm gonna
go back with my friends, then.

17:32.316 --> 17:36.453
Hello, hey, everybody,
uh, sorry for the delay.

17:36.454 --> 17:37.754
So we're gonna play for you,

17:37.789 --> 17:40.190
and, uh, not all
those songs I wrote

17:40.191 --> 17:41.858
about how fat your butts got

17:41.859 --> 17:43.293
because this shouldn't be
about revenge.

17:43.294 --> 17:44.594
It should be about having fun.

17:44.595 --> 17:45.996
Sure, we might suck.

17:45.997 --> 17:47.531
We might be total crap,
right, girls?

17:47.532 --> 17:48.598
BAND:
Uh...

17:48.599 --> 17:50.267
But that's okay.

17:50.301 --> 17:52.803
We're doing it 'cause
we love it. Whoo.

17:52.804 --> 17:54.137
And, uh, hey, uh...
shush, shush...

17:54.138 --> 17:55.839
listen, I got
something else to say.

17:55.840 --> 17:59.109
Back when this was just for fun,
when it was just us girls,

17:59.110 --> 18:02.179
there was someone who I loved to
sing with more than anyone else,

18:02.213 --> 18:04.281
and that's my sister Gayle.

18:04.282 --> 18:05.816
Hmm?
I'm sorry.

18:05.817 --> 18:07.284
I'm sorry to all you guys.

18:07.285 --> 18:09.186
This Ta-Ta has been a real boob.

18:09.187 --> 18:11.488
So, uh, our first song
is by Gayle.

18:11.489 --> 18:13.023
Let's hear it for her... Gayle!

18:13.024 --> 18:14.791
(gasps) Really?
Yes.

18:14.792 --> 18:15.959
Oh, God, Linda,
thank you so mu...

18:15.960 --> 18:17.594
My song, I get to do my s...

18:17.628 --> 18:19.362
Gayle, get up here quick
while I got 'em warmed up.

18:19.363 --> 18:20.697
