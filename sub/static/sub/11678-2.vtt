for an hour-- or 1 0.

is whether they can destroy their

What did you tell them?

I can see him walking around on the boat.

- Call me when it's done.
- All right.

- Sam, what about Quentin?

than an hour, he found everything that I did.

You need Greg and Bonnie dead
more than ever. They'reyour onlywitnesses.

38:07.269 --> 38:10.204

- Okay, okay. Fine.

38:10.272 --> 38:13.503
We'll go to the bank. I'll wire the money
toyour guy like we talked about.

38:13.576 --> 38:15.510
Wire the money?
With an F.B.I. tail?

38:15.578 --> 38:18.809
Areyou stupid? Or areyou just
trying to get us caught?

38:18.881 --> 38:21.315

Have a nice life.

38:21.383 --> 38:24.875

It has to happen right now! What areyou gonna
do, find some guy on the street and say...

38:30.860 --> 38:33.522

- You do it.

38:33.596 --> 38:36.895

Truth is, identitytheft isn't hard.

39:24.847 --> 39:27.907
A numberand an I.D. is allyou need
to drain a bank account...

39:27.983 --> 39:31.783
and return a lot ofmoney
to some very surprised retirees.

39:31.854 --> 39:33.788
But why stop there?

39:33.856 --> 39:36.051
As long as you're stealing
someone's identity...

39:36.125 --> 39:40.721
why not use it to contact some known terrorist
organizations on un-secure phone lines?

39:40.796 --> 39:45.290
Why not use it to threaten some federal
judges and insult the local drug cartel?

39:45.367 --> 39:49.064

39:53.175 --> 39:55.109

How did you get it all back?

40:05.821 --> 40:08.255
You don't want to know.

40:08.324 --> 40:11.259
- No, really, you don't want to know.
- Oh.

40:11.327 --> 40:14.694
Well, how much do I oweyou?

40:14.763 --> 40:17.254
Well, I didn't do it for the money.
Let's call it...

40:17.333 --> 40:20.700
500 for expenses.

40:20.769 --> 40:24.637
Call it 300, and you promise
not to enter any more contests.

Those men who came to the house
asking the questions--

40:52.868 --> 40:55.803
They gave me this.

40:55.871 --> 41:00.808
They asked me to call them ifyou should ever
come to Miami or try to contact me.

41:00.876 --> 41:03.071
Did you contact them?

41:03.145 --> 41:05.739
No, Michael, I did not.
