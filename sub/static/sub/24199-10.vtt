20:16.160 --> 20:17.330
They almost caught me.

20:17.360 --> 20:19.860
I-I don't...
go where?

20:19.900 --> 20:21.330
- Home.
- You have to pack a bag.

20:21.370 --> 20:22.800
Elizabeth: The essentials.
Almost nothing.

20:22.830 --> 20:24.180
- Home?
- A book bag would be fine.

20:24.180 --> 20:25.780
And then we'll answer
questions later.

20:25.850 --> 20:28.650
You mean Russia?

20:28.790 --> 20:30.690
Paige, we don't have...

20:33.460 --> 20:36.090
It's over.
This is how it works.

20:36.130 --> 20:37.230
It's not our choice.

20:37.300 --> 20:40.850
What, are supposed to... just...

20:40.980 --> 20:42.650
Does Henry know?

20:45.220 --> 20:46.790
What?

20:46.820 --> 20:48.320
He's staying here.

20:48.330 --> 20:49.720
What do you mean?

20:49.760 --> 20:51.590
At school.

20:51.630 --> 20:53.860
Henry's not coming with us?

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Paige, we're going to Russia.
What would he do there?

20:56.130 --> 20:58.520
So we're leaving him?
Alone?

20:58.650 --> 21:00.520
His friends are here,
his life is here...

21:00.650 --> 21:02.050
He's almost seventeen years old.

21:02.120 --> 21:03.720
That's the age I was
when I started to work.

21:03.860 --> 21:05.590
He's not you.
None of us are.

21:05.630 --> 21:08.130
He'll never talk to Dad again?
Or see him?

21:08.160 --> 21:09.660
Paige. The FBI could
be here any minute.

21:09.660 --> 21:11.300
They will arrest us. We...

21:11.430 --> 21:14.420
I don't care. Can't you just...
What's going to happen to him?

21:14.420 --> 21:17.890
I don't understand.
How's he going to... live?

21:17.890 --> 21:19.220
Who's going to pay
for his college?

21:19.290 --> 21:20.860
Is he going to
be able to get a job?

21:20.890 --> 21:23.460
This is hard for all of us.
We all love Henry. Okay?

21:23.460 --> 21:24.890
Yeah, do you?

21:24.960 --> 21:26.890
You know we do.

21:26.960 --> 21:28.900
And that's why this is
the best thing for him.

21:28.900 --> 21:30.280
- It's the only way.
- He won't understand.

21:30.420 --> 21:31.620
- There has to be a way...
- Paige...

21:31.720 --> 21:33.250
Let's just think
about this for a second.

21:33.320 --> 21:35.650
We cannot take him.

21:35.720 --> 21:37.190
He'll hate you.

21:37.220 --> 21:38.520
We know that.

21:38.560 --> 21:40.460
We have to go,
and we have to go now.

21:40.530 --> 21:41.990
Come on.

21:42.030 --> 21:44.760
Come on. Now.

Stan: Hey...

22:28.960 --> 22:30.230
Stan.

22:31.580 --> 22:33.680
- Hi, Paige.
- Hi.

22:33.750 --> 22:36.690
Philip: Wha...
What're you doing here?

22:36.820 --> 22:38.790
That's a great question.

22:38.920 --> 22:40.920
What's wrong?

22:40.960 --> 22:43.630
Paige, where are you guys going?

22:43.700 --> 22:45.200
Home.

22:45.300 --> 22:49.520
Really? Huh. Why?
What's going on?

22:49.650 --> 22:51.650
I'm not feeling good.

22:51.790 --> 22:55.190
Both your parents
came to pick you up?

22:55.260 --> 22:57.190
That seems a little strange.

22:57.190 --> 22:59.260
We were coming from work.

22:59.300 --> 23:01.960
You were just at work...

23:02.030 --> 23:04.630
Why are you acting this way?

23:04.680 --> 23:08.820
You're feeling sick?
What's wrong?

23:08.950 --> 23:11.190
My stomach hurts.

23:11.220 --> 23:15.430
You're going home, from college,
for a stomachache?

23:15.460 --> 23:17.630
I feel sick.

23:17.700 --> 23:19.400
Wh... why are you
interrogating her?

23:22.220 --> 23:23.520
Where's their car, Paige?

23:23.650 --> 23:26.590
It's in the dealership getting serviced.

23:26.760 --> 23:28.160
We've got a loaner.

23:30.460 --> 23:32.990
So what happens if I call in this plate?

23:33.130 --> 23:35.100
[Scoffs]

23:35.230 --> 23:36.360
Are you kidding me?

23:36.430 --> 23:37.900
What happens?

23:38.020 --> 23:39.020
I don't know.

23:39.080 --> 23:41.020
What is with you?

23:41.020 --> 23:43.320
Maybe you've got
this backstopped.

23:43.360 --> 23:45.720
But I'm not some traffic cop.

23:45.860 --> 23:48.430
I can find out in five minutes
whether this license plate's

23:48.490 --> 23:52.700
really registered to
a loaner car for a dealership.

23:52.770 --> 23:56.180
Stan, I don't know
what the problem is.

23:56.320 --> 23:57.920
Maybe you... you and I...

23:58.050 --> 24:00.590
Stop moving.
You fucking piece of shit.

24:00.620 --> 24:02.520
What're you...?
What're you doing?

24:02.520 --> 24:04.060
What are you doing?

24:09.230 --> 24:11.230
Lie down on the ground.

24:11.330 --> 24:13.120
- All of you.
- Stan...

24:13.190 --> 24:14.650
W-What are you gonna do,
shoot us?

24:14.790 --> 24:16.750
On the ground. Face down.

24:16.790 --> 24:19.720
Keep your hands where
I can see them. Move slow.

24:19.790 --> 24:21.320
Stan, we're not lying
on the ground,

24:21.321 --> 24:21.690
this is Paige... Stan.

24:21.830 --> 24:24.900
Stop!
Elizabeth, just... stop.

24:25.030 --> 24:26.220
It's over.

24:30.390 --> 24:32.760
It's all over.

24:45.320 --> 24:47.890
We had a job to do.

24:52.890 --> 24:56.230
We had a job to do.

25:00.790 --> 25:02.920
You were my best friend.

25:05.490 --> 25:07.890
You were mine, too.

25:12.900 --> 25:15.460
I never wanted to lie to you.

25:17.850 --> 25:21.390
Stan, what else could I do?
You moved in next to me.

25:21.420 --> 25:25.220
I was terrified.

25:25.260 --> 25:27.730
And then...
we ended up as friends.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.460
Friends?

25:32.920 --> 25:34.720
You made my life a joke.

25:34.790 --> 25:37.090
You were my only friend.

25:37.090 --> 25:42.430
In my... in my
whole shitty life.

25:42.430 --> 25:43.890
For all these years.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.630
My life was the joke.
Not yours.

25:50.920 --> 25:52.850
And Matthew?

25:52.990 --> 25:55.190
What that part of this?
My son...

25:55.260 --> 25:57.160
She didn't know.
She didn't know until...

25:57.230 --> 25:59.160
I knew.

26:00.660 --> 26:04.460
They told me when I was sixteen.

26:04.470 --> 26:07.680
But Matthew...
it had nothing to do with that.

26:07.720 --> 26:10.690
I just...

26:10.760 --> 26:12.320
liked him.

26:14.830 --> 26:16.220
[Voice breaking]
Henry?

26:16.260 --> 26:18.360
No.

26:18.500 --> 26:20.300
He doesn't know anything.

26:24.150 --> 26:26.020
All this time...

26:29.490 --> 26:31.890
I would have done
anything for you, Philip.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.660
For all of you.

26:37.130 --> 26:38.500
I know.

26:43.690 --> 26:45.890
Did you...

26:45.960 --> 26:48.860
Gennadi and Sofia...
that was you.

26:50.360 --> 26:52.730
W-Who is that?
W-We don't know who that is...

26:52.860 --> 26:54.260
You fucking liar.

26:54.330 --> 26:59.220
I saw it on your face.
When I told you about them.

27:02.720 --> 27:05.890
Do you know how many people have
been killed by Soviet agents

27:06.030 --> 27:08.430
here in Washington
in the last year?

27:08.560 --> 27:11.000
Five years? Ten...?

27:11.000 --> 27:12.780
I-I'm sorry.

27:12.920 --> 27:14.350
We don't kill people, Jesus.

27:14.490 --> 27:15.950
We... We wouldn't...

27:15.990 --> 27:17.720
He doesn't even do this
kind of work anymore.

27:17.720 --> 27:20.520
He quit.
He's a travel agent now.

27:20.530 --> 27:23.190
That's all.

27:29.920 --> 27:31.180
Get down.

27:31.190 --> 27:33.650
On the ground.

27:33.790 --> 27:35.760
[Exhales softly]

27:38.560 --> 27:40.590
Get down.

27:50.050 --> 27:55.390
I-I did all this stuff, Stan.

27:55.430 --> 27:58.730
I don't even know why anymore.

27:58.760 --> 28:01.660
It... It seemed like
the right thing to do.

28:01.700 --> 28:04.420
For my country...

28:04.550 --> 28:06.620
My country wanted me to.

28:06.690 --> 28:10.440
And I... And I...

28:10.460 --> 28:11.920
I kept doing it.

28:11.930 --> 28:15.630
Telling myself
it was important...

28:15.630 --> 28:17.160
until finally... I couldn't.

28:17.200 --> 28:19.420
And I... I stopped.

28:23.650 --> 28:26.520
I'm done with that now.
I have been for a long time.

28:26.590 --> 28:31.560
It w... It was all just
screwing people for...

28:34.000 --> 28:36.650
I don't... I don't
even know for what.

28:40.150 --> 28:42.950
So I quit, like she said.
Like you did.

28:42.990 --> 28:46.260
I'm a travel agent now.

28:46.290 --> 28:50.700
I'm just... I'm just a shitty,
failing travel agent.

28:50.700 --> 28:52.030
[Sighs]

28:52.030 --> 28:55.220
Except I guess I'm not.

28:55.290 --> 28:58.720
Because now I...
I need to leave...

28:58.860 --> 29:03.120
If I can...

29:03.160 --> 29:05.260
I have to run away
from the place

29:05.300 --> 29:08.900
that I have lived
for the past...

29:08.970 --> 29:10.550
so many years...

29:10.680 --> 29:14.650
If I can, if... if we can...

29:18.460 --> 29:23.100
Stan, I have to
abandon my son...

29:23.100 --> 29:24.800
He can't come with us...

29:24.800 --> 29:26.980
Because I got caught.

29:30.490 --> 29:32.590
I finally got caught.

29:32.660 --> 29:34.920
And here we are.

29:34.960 --> 29:37.660
And I don't even know

29:37.660 --> 29:39.330
what happens if
we make it home because...

29:39.460 --> 29:43.850
after all these years of
being scared of Americans

29:43.980 --> 29:46.650
and recruiting Americans
and following Americans...

29:46.790 --> 29:48.590
we finally...
We actually got something,

29:48.690 --> 29:53.690
and it has nothing
to do with you...

29:53.830 --> 29:57.200
It's our own people.

29:57.200 --> 29:58.900
It's a bunch
of fucking Russians.

30:01.520 --> 30:04.420
They're trying to
get rid of Gorbachev.

30:04.460 --> 30:07.860
And we figured it out.
Her, really.

30:07.990 --> 30:10.590
It's our own bosses.

30:10.660 --> 30:13.060
They were going to
fake my reports,

30:13.200 --> 30:15.330
make it seem like Gorbachev
was trading away

30:15.470 --> 30:18.380
military secrets at the Summit.

30:18.420 --> 30:24.060
The people I trusted
all this time, and now...

30:26.760 --> 30:28.690
Do you know Oleg Burov?

30:30.060 --> 30:31.600
W-Who is that?

30:31.600 --> 30:35.020
Don't bullshit me now, Philip.

30:35.090 --> 30:38.120
We arrested him earlier today,
picking up a dead drop.

30:38.160 --> 30:41.660
He told me the message
was about people in the KGB

30:41.730 --> 30:43.390
trying to get rid of Gorbachev.

30:43.390 --> 30:46.400
Told me I had to
send it back to Russia.

30:46.530 --> 30:48.600
That message has to
get back home.

30:48.670 --> 30:51.120
I could care less
who runs your country.

30:51.190 --> 30:55.450
Stan. These people, if...
If they're not stopped...

30:55.490 --> 30:56.660
that's our whole country.

30:56.790 --> 30:59.490
That's... That's
our whole future.

30:59.560 --> 31:01.290
And... it's the world...

31:01.430 --> 31:05.130
And whether we get to live in
peace or not depends on this.

31:05.170 --> 31:07.020
We have to tell them
what happened here.

31:07.080 --> 31:08.550
Because if that dead drop
didn't go through...

31:08.590 --> 31:12.390
We're the only ones
who can stop this now.

31:12.420 --> 31:15.320
I don't know why
you should trust me.

31:15.460 --> 31:18.460
You should hate me.
You sh...

31:18.530 --> 31:22.460
You should probably shoot me.

31:22.530 --> 31:24.720
But we're getting in that car

31:24.720 --> 31:28.420
and we're driving away.

31:33.060 --> 31:37.430
I wish you'd stayed
with me in EST.

31:41.420 --> 31:45.520
You might know what to do here.

31:53.730 --> 31:55.980
You have to take care of Henry.

32:01.320 --> 32:04.590
He loves you, Stan.

32:04.660 --> 32:06.860
Tell him the truth.

Paige... we have passports,
to leave the country.

34:17.630 --> 34:20.480
We look different in them.
You too.

and change the way we look.

We have to see him.

34:31.730 --> 34:33.330
We can't.

34:35.969 --> 34:38.949
We can call him, just to talk.

It's not a good idea...
I'm sorry.

we call him and move...
