00:01.302 --> 00:04.238
ADULT ADAM: Back in the '80s,
my mom began work
on her opus.

00:04.272 --> 00:06.006
The Beverly Goldberg Cookbook.

00:06.040 --> 00:08.509
She awkwardly pecked away
at the typewriter for hours,

00:08.542 --> 00:10.911
carefully listing
every Parm-filled recipe

00:10.944 --> 00:12.980
with meticulous detail.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.783
She was so hell-bent on
making her book a reality

00:15.816 --> 00:18.352
that she enlisted me
to take the cover photo.

00:18.386 --> 00:22.323
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)

00:22.356 --> 00:24.692
I don't know.
I... I'm not feeling this.

00:24.725 --> 00:26.494
Maybe bring
a little energy to it.

00:28.462 --> 00:29.797
Maybe not that much.

00:29.830 --> 00:32.133
ADULT ADAM:
My mom was determined
to make every recipe

00:32.166 --> 00:34.034
a cheesy, over-sauced
masterpiece.

00:34.068 --> 00:36.036
Naturally, we had to be
the taste-testers,

00:36.070 --> 00:38.206
which was exhausting
for everyone.

00:38.239 --> 00:40.508
My belly's
at full capacity.
Oh, God.

00:40.541 --> 00:43.777
ADULT ADAM:
Yep, no one was off
the hook, day or night.

00:43.811 --> 00:44.978
Incoming.

00:45.012 --> 00:47.348
Gah... Mom!
We're trying to watch
a movie!

00:47.381 --> 00:50.484
And what better movie snack
than my triple-cream
beef stew?

00:50.518 --> 00:53.020
Oh, God. Please no. I have
a major lactose intoler...

00:53.921 --> 00:55.556
Ooh, that is
rich in dairy.

00:55.589 --> 00:57.991
(SNORING)

00:58.025 --> 01:00.027
Linguini and clams
coming in.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.362
Mmm.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.697
(MUTTERING HAPPILY)

01:07.901 --> 01:09.703
* I'm twisted up inside

01:09.737 --> 01:13.207
* But nonetheless
I feel the need to say

01:15.576 --> 01:17.044
* I don't know the future

01:17.077 --> 01:21.182
* But the past keeps getting
clearer every day *

01:21.215 --> 01:23.751
ADULT ADAM:
It was February 27th,
1980-something,

01:23.784 --> 01:25.219
and my brother and I were busy

01:25.253 --> 01:27.355
getting our daily dose
of exercise.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.690
Okay, kiddos.

01:29.723 --> 01:32.493
Stop with your beep-boops
and your lady-reading.

01:32.526 --> 01:35.529
Your cousin is gonna
be here any minute.

01:35.563 --> 01:37.731
How exactly are we related
to this schmo, again?

01:37.765 --> 01:39.533
You know my mom's
great-aunt Rose?
ERICA: Who?

01:39.567 --> 01:40.868
No.
Already bored.

01:40.901 --> 01:44.071
Well, Rose's sister Esther
married Schmooly,

01:44.104 --> 01:46.707
they had two sons,
Freddie and Ivan,

01:46.740 --> 01:48.709
who each married twin sisters.

01:48.742 --> 01:50.144
So, he's not so much
our cousin

01:50.178 --> 01:51.612
as he is a total stranger.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.013
Family is family.

01:53.046 --> 01:54.615
Even if they're from
the Old Country.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.284
We live in modern times now.

01:56.317 --> 01:58.952
How is a country
still old? How?

01:58.986 --> 02:01.289
That's exactly why
I brought him to visit,

02:01.322 --> 02:02.723
so you can get to know him

02:02.756 --> 02:05.125
and ask him questions
about life back in Russia.

02:05.159 --> 02:06.627
Wait, he's Russian?

02:06.660 --> 02:09.930
That means he's been bred
since birth in a KGB lab

02:09.963 --> 02:11.599
to destroy
our wonderful democracy.

02:11.632 --> 02:14.268
Sit down.
He's not a spy, Barry.

02:14.302 --> 02:17.538
He comes from a tiny village
that barely has running water.

02:17.571 --> 02:20.808
The floor of his home is dirt,
for God's sake.

02:20.841 --> 02:22.410
How does he know when
he's done sweeping?

02:22.443 --> 02:24.278
He never is.

02:24.312 --> 02:26.414
Look, I think meeting
Groiseh Gleb

02:26.447 --> 02:28.782
is just what you kids need
to get a little perspective.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.050
Wait, what's his name?

02:30.083 --> 02:31.452
Gleb.
Are you saying Glen?

02:31.485 --> 02:32.586
No, Gleb.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.054
As in actress Glenn Close?

02:34.087 --> 02:35.155
Gleb!

02:35.189 --> 02:36.490
So, not Glenn Close.

02:36.524 --> 02:38.592
We've got three Glebs
in the family,

02:38.626 --> 02:40.093
which is confusing,

02:40.127 --> 02:42.896
so that's why everyone
calls him Groiseh Gleb.

02:42.930 --> 02:43.997
What's "groiseh" mean?

02:44.031 --> 02:46.467
Groiseh means
big and plump.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.670
Trust me, you're gonna
love Big Gleb. (LAUGHS)

02:49.703 --> 02:53.040
Of the three Glebs,
he's the funniest Gleb.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.778
There he is.
How ya been, Gleb?

02:57.811 --> 02:59.280
(IN RUSSIAN ACCENT) Fine.

02:59.313 --> 03:01.014
You just flew in from Kiev.

03:01.048 --> 03:03.484
Boy, your arms must be tired.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.919
Yes. My whole body's
very tired.

03:05.953 --> 03:08.088
You think this Gleb came
instead of funny Gleb?

03:08.121 --> 03:09.890
Bag? Take.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.626
Whoa! That is dense.

03:12.660 --> 03:15.296
So. Gleb.
How are things?

03:15.329 --> 03:16.664
GLEB: Hungry.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.131
ERICA: Okey-dokey.

03:19.367 --> 03:20.468
Is okay?

03:20.501 --> 03:21.802
You're family.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.671
Our plums are your plums.

03:24.472 --> 03:25.939
Mmm.

03:25.973 --> 03:27.341
So juicy.

03:27.375 --> 03:28.709
Nothing like this back home.

03:28.742 --> 03:32.813
And to think, you kids just
take that plum for granted.

03:32.846 --> 03:35.483
Uh-huh. How long's
this dude gonna be here?

03:35.516 --> 03:38.619
Two weeks.
There's only so many fruits
we can introduce him to.

03:38.652 --> 03:41.489
We live in the birthplace
of America.

03:41.522 --> 03:43.791
Show the man around.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.393
I'm gonna go get him
a banana.

03:45.426 --> 03:46.760
He'll go crazy.

03:48.128 --> 03:49.997
ADULT ADAM:
And just like that,
we had to entertain

03:50.030 --> 03:51.899
our Old Country cousin, Gleb.

03:51.932 --> 03:54.302
While my mom was busy
entertaining the Frentas

03:54.335 --> 03:55.703
with a fancy brunch.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.237
I mean, I knew
Babs had range,

03:57.271 --> 04:00.207
but watching her play
a young male farmer?

04:00.240 --> 04:02.009
I mean, transcendent.

04:02.042 --> 04:04.545
Mmm-hmm.
Oh, well, speaking
of cookbooks...

04:04.578 --> 04:06.814
Uh, no one's speaking
of cookbooks, Beverly.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.349
We were actually just
talking about Yentl.

04:08.382 --> 04:10.250
Yeah, well,
now speaking of cookbooks,

04:10.284 --> 04:12.553
um, did I mention
I'm writing a cookbook?

04:12.586 --> 04:14.488
You mean the cookbook you've
somehow managed to work into

04:14.522 --> 04:15.856
every conversation
in the last month?

04:15.889 --> 04:17.257
That's probably
the one, yes.

04:17.291 --> 04:20.861
Well, I have been very busy
cooking and taste-testing,

04:20.894 --> 04:22.330
practicing my banter

04:22.363 --> 04:24.064
for the inevitable
big city book signings.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.899
If you need any help
with your book,

04:25.933 --> 04:28.001
I can slip you
my chicken piccata recipe.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.269
I can help, too.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.772
Sometimes I think my
peanut-butter blondies

04:31.805 --> 04:34.408
are the only thing
my family respects
about me.

04:34.442 --> 04:37.177
They are,
and that's so generous,
but this is...

04:37.210 --> 04:39.580
(CLICKS TONGUE) It's
a Beverly Goldberg cookbook.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.615
I swear to God,
if you say the word
"cookbook" one more time,

04:41.649 --> 04:43.684
I'm gonna stab myself with
this tiny jam spreader!

04:43.717 --> 04:45.218
Me too!
All you talk about

04:45.252 --> 04:46.687
is that gosh darn cookbook

04:46.720 --> 04:48.722
and how you're gonna be thick
as thieves with Julia Child!

04:48.756 --> 04:51.725
All I'm saying is that
sometimes you just know

04:51.759 --> 04:53.394
you're gonna be best friends
with someone

04:53.427 --> 04:56.029
before you meet them,
and that's obviously
very threatening

04:56.063 --> 04:57.130
to the three of you.

04:57.164 --> 04:58.899
Oh.
It really is not!

04:58.932 --> 05:00.701
It's just that when
we all get together,

05:00.734 --> 05:02.603
all you do is talk
about cooking.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.638
Or the Bevolution.
Or you trying
to be a lawyer.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.106
Wow.

05:06.139 --> 05:09.209
I was not prepared
for that tsunami
of jealousy

05:09.242 --> 05:10.578
coming at me right now.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.746
I'm sorry the rest of you
don't have anything exciting

05:12.780 --> 05:14.482
going on in your lives.

05:14.515 --> 05:15.716
You know what?

05:15.749 --> 05:16.917
I think you should go.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.952
Go? It's my house!
You go!

05:19.787 --> 05:21.288
Oh, but before you go,
which one of these

05:21.321 --> 05:23.491
would look better on
the front of my cookbook?

05:23.524 --> 05:25.092
Unbelievable.
You're the worst.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.628
ADULT ADAM: As the Frentas
ditched my mom,

05:27.661 --> 05:30.831
we were doing our best
to get to know our cousin.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.199
Where's unfunny Gleb?

05:32.232 --> 05:35.736
Outside opening and closing
the garage door
with the clicker.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.671
On the plus side,
it killed three hours.

05:37.705 --> 05:40.107
Why are we stuck
babysitting
a complete stranger?

05:40.140 --> 05:41.274
(GASPS)

05:41.308 --> 05:43.243
Stranger. That's it!

05:43.276 --> 05:44.978
ADULT ADAM:
Yep, Barry's brilliant plan

05:45.012 --> 05:47.114
was inspired by this '80s gem.

05:47.147 --> 05:50.751
Cheggit! Looks like we got
our very own
Balki Bartokomous.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.786
ERICA: he lovable foreign guy
from Perfect Strangers?

05:52.820 --> 05:53.954
Oh, yes.

05:53.987 --> 05:56.524
And that makes
the three of us
Coe-sin Larry.

05:56.557 --> 05:59.660
ADULT ADAM:
Crazy as it seems,
this was 100% true.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.995
Just like the classic sitcom,
we had a kooky cousin

06:02.029 --> 06:03.664
from the Old Country
living with us.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.298
Only one question remained.

06:05.332 --> 06:06.667
But what do we need
a Balki for?

06:06.700 --> 06:09.937
Hello? We got a dude
who will do
whatever we say

06:09.970 --> 06:12.873
'cause he's trusting
and unfamiliar
with our ways.

06:12.906 --> 06:14.141
Do what, exactly?

06:14.174 --> 06:15.443
He's an adult man.

06:15.476 --> 06:17.445
That means
he can buy us beer

06:17.478 --> 06:19.947
and rent us cars
and co-sign loans.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.014
The sky's the limit.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.149
Come on.

06:22.182 --> 06:24.618
Gleb won't just blindly
do whatever we say.

06:24.652 --> 06:26.353
Really?

06:26.386 --> 06:28.822
For the past ten minutes,
he's been listening to

06:28.856 --> 06:31.324
that special cassette
that cleans the tape deck.

06:31.358 --> 06:33.694
Dude, using our childlike
foreign relative

06:33.727 --> 06:35.963
for our own selfish gain
is crossing a line.

06:35.996 --> 06:37.831
Not to mention,
Perfect Strangers

06:37.865 --> 06:39.733
is built on the flimsiest
of premises.

06:39.767 --> 06:42.302
You both make good points
that are hard to ignore.

06:42.335 --> 06:44.104
And yet, I will.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.307
ADULT ADAM:
And so Barry proceeded

06:47.340 --> 06:49.643
to Perfect Stranger
our cousin Gleb.

06:49.677 --> 06:52.212
It just so happens,
it was on the windiest day

06:52.245 --> 06:54.147
in Philadelphia history.

06:54.181 --> 06:57.551
* Sometimes the world
looks perfect

06:58.385 --> 07:00.521
* Nothing to rearrange

07:00.554 --> 07:04.157
* Sometimes you just
get a feeling

07:04.191 --> 07:08.529
* Like you need some
kind of change

07:08.562 --> 07:11.899
* No matter what the odds
are this time
Whoo-hoo!

07:11.932 --> 07:14.267
* Nothing's gonna stand
in my way

07:14.301 --> 07:16.069
* This flame in my heart

07:16.103 --> 07:17.771
* Like a long-lost friend

07:17.805 --> 07:21.509
* Gives every dark street
a light at the end

07:21.542 --> 07:23.043
Don't move.

07:23.076 --> 07:25.713
* Standing tall

07:25.746 --> 07:27.848
So, you are using him
as your Balki

07:27.881 --> 07:29.249
even though
we told you not to?

07:29.282 --> 07:31.184
I am.
Looks kinda fun.

07:31.218 --> 07:32.285
It is.

07:32.319 --> 07:35.623
* Standing tall

07:35.656 --> 07:39.126
* On the wings of my dream

07:39.159 --> 07:41.061
* The rain and thunder

07:41.094 --> 07:42.763
* The wind and haze

07:42.796 --> 07:46.066
* I'm bound for better days

07:46.099 --> 07:49.703
* It's my life, my dream

07:49.737 --> 07:53.306
* And nothing's gonna
stop me now *

07:53.340 --> 07:55.275
ADULT ADAM: Hanging with Gleb
turned out to be a real hoot.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.376
Aah!

07:56.409 --> 07:57.745
As for my mom, she was ready

07:57.778 --> 07:59.146
to make a real apology.

07:59.179 --> 08:02.983
Ladies, thank you for
coming here today.

08:03.016 --> 08:05.786
I know things got
a bit tense
at our last brunch,

08:05.819 --> 08:09.289
but everything's made better
with tea and babka.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.390
Babka does help.

08:10.423 --> 08:11.825
(WOMEN CHUCKLE)

08:11.859 --> 08:14.094
Look, you guys
are my dearest friends,

08:14.127 --> 08:16.764
and I don't want you
thinking that I can't go

08:16.797 --> 08:19.066
ten seconds without
talking about myself.

08:19.099 --> 08:21.068
Well, it's only
every 30 seconds.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.336
(WOMEN SNICKER)
(CHUCKLES)

08:23.370 --> 08:25.005
Oh, come on.

08:25.038 --> 08:27.007
You all know I can go
at least 30 minutes.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.275
(LAUGHTER)

08:28.308 --> 08:30.110
What? I can.

08:30.143 --> 08:32.412
I'll tell ya what.
If you can go ten minutes

08:32.445 --> 08:34.782
without making a single
reference to yourself...

08:34.815 --> 08:35.949
Your kids.
Your opinions.

08:35.983 --> 08:38.085
Your sweaters.
Your couponing expertise.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.252
How Farrah Fawcett
stole your look.

08:39.286 --> 08:40.320
Your matchmaking.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.622
Let's not forget
about the cookbook.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.456
Then you'll have
proven us wrong.

08:43.490 --> 08:46.760
And what happens
when I immediately
prove you all wrong?

08:46.794 --> 08:48.596
Well, then, we will admit
you're right,

08:48.629 --> 08:50.497
and then for the next
ten brunches,

08:50.530 --> 08:52.365
all we'll do
is talk about you.

08:52.399 --> 08:54.034
That's my dream.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.169
Challenge accepted, suckas.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.504
(LAUGHS) Go!

08:57.537 --> 09:00.473
ADULT ADAM:
And so began my mom's
epic journey to listen.

09:00.507 --> 09:01.541
Yeah.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.276
Turns out, it was hard.

09:03.310 --> 09:06.446
Mm. Mm-hmm.
She endured stories about
other people's kids...

09:06.479 --> 09:07.815
(LAUGHS)

09:07.848 --> 09:09.850
...other people's opinions,

09:10.918 --> 09:12.419
other people's lives...

09:12.452 --> 09:14.454
I'm just gonna stretch.
You guys keep talking.

09:14.487 --> 09:17.324
...and the hardest of all,
other people's cooking.

09:17.357 --> 09:19.827
...when Chad said that
my chicken was dry.

09:19.860 --> 09:20.861
Cookbook!

09:21.394 --> 09:23.396
Cookbook!

09:23.430 --> 09:25.532
Oh, I have a cookbook
with so many recipes

09:25.565 --> 09:27.968
that Chad would like more
than your bone-dry chicken!

09:28.001 --> 09:30.270
Also, Adam went
to a sci-fi convention,

09:30.303 --> 09:31.705
and Barry's applying to Penn,

09:31.739 --> 09:33.006
and Erica, there's not much
going on there,

09:33.040 --> 09:34.241
but she's still
a beautiful angel

09:34.274 --> 09:35.508
and so much better
than your kids,

09:35.542 --> 09:36.844
and, oh, my God,
that felt so good.

09:36.877 --> 09:37.978
And you lose.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.379
Come on.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.981
That had to have been
at least nine minutes.

09:41.014 --> 09:42.049
It was two.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.383
Oh, speaking
of telling time,

09:43.416 --> 09:45.485
you know, Murray got me
this new Swatch
for our anniversary.

09:45.518 --> 09:46.754
Okay.
We're gonna go now.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.288
No. Double or nothing?

09:48.321 --> 09:49.690
Fine. Go.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.359
Farrah did steal my look!

09:54.762 --> 09:57.197
ADULT ADAM:
We had Perfect Stranger -ed
our distant cousin Gleb,

09:57.230 --> 09:58.699
and it was all
working out perfectly.

09:58.732 --> 10:00.400
At least, we thought it was.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.703
So, how's it going
with your cousin?

10:02.736 --> 10:03.837
Aces.
So great.

10:03.871 --> 10:06.907
We've been having a blast
showing Gleb around.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.742
Like yesterday, he was dying

10:08.776 --> 10:11.344
to drive me to the Starlog
Convention in Jersey.

10:11.378 --> 10:13.380
Oh, and today, he insisted

10:13.413 --> 10:15.515
on renting me a shore house
for the summer.

10:15.548 --> 10:18.051
He's the coolest barely-cousin
I've ever had.

10:18.085 --> 10:19.552
No! Is lies!

10:19.586 --> 10:22.589
They treat me like idiot
and use me
for your personal gain.

10:23.423 --> 10:25.993
The sweaty boy
make me buy crossbow.

10:26.026 --> 10:28.095
Crossbow?
You can't have that!

10:28.128 --> 10:30.363
Ah, according to this license,
I can.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.733
Lady sister make me
rent beach house

10:32.766 --> 10:35.302
so can party like NBA star.

10:35.335 --> 10:38.038
And tiny one
make me drive him

10:38.071 --> 10:40.708
to American virgin
space festival.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.275
I'm just gonna assume
there's something

10:42.309 --> 10:43.811
lost in translation here.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.979
You raise spoiled children

10:46.013 --> 10:50.951
who make me be
Balki Bartokomous from
Perfect Stranger TV show.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.886
You get Perfect Strangers
in the Old Country?

10:52.920 --> 10:53.987
Nyet!

10:54.021 --> 10:55.789
You play it in front of me

10:55.823 --> 10:58.358
and say your plan out loud,
like fools!

10:58.391 --> 10:59.592
That, we did.

10:59.626 --> 11:01.528
What is wrong with you?

11:01.561 --> 11:03.663
You were supposed
to get to know him.

11:03.697 --> 11:05.232
In our defense,
our time together

11:05.265 --> 11:07.267
was packed with kooky
misadventures

11:07.300 --> 11:08.902
and we had very little time
to dig in.

11:08.936 --> 11:10.270
Oh, my God.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.639
He came all this way
to America.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.274
Show him America.

11:14.307 --> 11:16.509
ADULT ADAM:
And show him, we did.

11:16.543 --> 11:19.146
(TIRES SCREECH)
We jetted off for a day of
bonding with Coe-sin Gleb.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.348
(HORN HONKS)
We knew the guy had
a thing for fresh fruit,

11:21.381 --> 11:22.950
so we began at
the Baederwood Market.

11:22.983 --> 11:25.252
It made him happy.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.955
Next, we took Gleb to see
the latest Rocky movie.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.522
I must break you.

11:29.556 --> 11:30.791
ADULT ADAM:
But the Russian lost.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.192
It made him sad.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.661
So, to cheer up funny Gleb,

11:34.694 --> 11:36.496
we figured we'd introduce
him to America's

11:36.529 --> 11:40.000
favorite Russian comedian
of the '80s. Yakov Smirnoff.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.002
Good thing about doing
comedy in Russia,

11:42.035 --> 11:43.771
you have captured audience.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.238
(LAUGHTER)

11:45.272 --> 11:47.507
ADULT ADAM:
Unfortunately, Gleb found
his act a little too real.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.476
What's going on?

11:49.509 --> 11:52.112
I thought you were out
showing Gleb the town.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.714
No! First they show me
Rocky IV,

11:54.748 --> 11:56.817
then they force me
to listen to man

11:56.850 --> 11:59.019
who make fun of horrors
of the past.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.154
Why? Is no humor!

12:01.188 --> 12:02.722
Okay, well,
when he puts it like that,

12:02.756 --> 12:04.724
it sounds like we're not
good family members.

12:04.758 --> 12:08.896
Albert,
your children's children
are people of garbage.

12:08.929 --> 12:11.198
I have to say I agree.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.500
All I wanted was to
give you everything

12:13.533 --> 12:15.803
my family never had.

12:15.836 --> 12:18.671
But all I did
was spoil you rotten.

12:18.705 --> 12:21.041
You got to be very careful
of what jokes you say.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.810
If you say, like,
"Take my wife, please,"

12:22.843 --> 12:24.544
you get home, she's gone.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.879
(LAUGHTER)

12:30.417 --> 12:31.684
Bev! Oh, wow!

12:31.718 --> 12:33.253
You're here! Hello!

12:33.286 --> 12:34.387
Hey, Ginzy.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.423
Just thought I'd pop by
and return your Cuisinart.

12:36.456 --> 12:37.624
Oh, no. Keep it.
It's yours forever.

12:37.657 --> 12:39.426
Have a nice day.
BEVERLY: What?

12:40.227 --> 12:41.594
You're brunching.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.196
Without me?

12:43.230 --> 12:44.231
We can explain.

12:45.765 --> 12:46.934
Yes.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.902
Okay, you know what?
It's fine.

12:49.937 --> 12:52.339
Words were said,
feelings were hurt,

12:52.372 --> 12:54.507
but I am a big enough person

12:54.541 --> 12:56.443
to pretend that none of this
has ever happened.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.078
Sorry, seat's taken.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.679
ADULT ADAM:
But this happened.

12:59.712 --> 13:02.382
The Frentas replaced my mom
with another yenta.

13:02.415 --> 13:04.117
Oh, for God's sakes.

13:04.151 --> 13:07.454
You invited Eileen Leffler
instead of me?

13:07.487 --> 13:10.290
We just want a friend
who doesn't only talk
about herself.

13:10.323 --> 13:13.693
And she listens to us
and even asks
follow-up questions.

13:13.726 --> 13:15.795
Here's a follow-up question,
Linda.

13:15.829 --> 13:17.965
Not a lot of people came
to your New Year's party,

13:17.998 --> 13:19.399
and I felt bad for you.

13:19.432 --> 13:21.134
That is not a question.

13:21.168 --> 13:22.435
It's a hurtful statement.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.937
I cannot believe
you just thought

13:23.971 --> 13:25.105
you were gonna replace me.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.107
No one is replacing anyone.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.641
There's room
for five Frentas.

13:28.675 --> 13:31.044
Well, there's only four
drying stations at the salon.

13:31.078 --> 13:32.812
What, someone's gonna sit
at the end

13:32.846 --> 13:34.614
with a towel on her head,
like a chump?

13:34.647 --> 13:36.549
I thought we would
just take turns.

13:36.583 --> 13:41.288
Look, you are my dearest
and closest friends,

13:41.321 --> 13:43.623
and I love you so much,

13:43.656 --> 13:45.926
but right now you're acting
like a bunch of (BLEEP).

13:45.959 --> 13:48.428
Oh.
Okay, if I may pipe in here.

13:48.461 --> 13:51.364
Beverly,
I truly admire you,

13:51.398 --> 13:54.067
and I think you
are an amazing woman,

13:54.101 --> 13:56.904
but it seems like
you're acting
like the (BLEEP) here.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.438
How dare you?

13:58.471 --> 13:59.572
Wow!

13:59.606 --> 14:01.774
The potty mouth
on this one!

14:01.808 --> 14:04.511
Huh? That's who you wanna
replace me with?

14:04.544 --> 14:05.612
Hmm.

14:05.645 --> 14:07.314
Well, (BLEEP)

14:07.347 --> 14:10.150
ADULT ADAM:
And so my mom swore off
the Frentas forever.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.352
Meanwhile, Pops had
taken it upon himself

14:12.385 --> 14:15.355
to show just how spoiled
his grandkids had become.

14:15.388 --> 14:16.623
What the hell?

14:16.656 --> 14:18.658
Why is Gleb wearing
my Flyers shirt?

14:18.691 --> 14:21.028
Forget your dumb shirt.
Why does he have my Caboodle?

14:21.061 --> 14:22.762
You mean Gleb's Caboodle.

14:22.795 --> 14:25.298
Is perfect for storing
beets and cabbage.

14:25.332 --> 14:26.833
I've decided to
take everything

14:26.866 --> 14:28.368
I've ever bought you

14:28.401 --> 14:29.937
and give it to Gleb.
What?

14:29.970 --> 14:31.304
No way!
But it's our stuff!

14:31.338 --> 14:33.640
But Gleb actually
appreciates it

14:33.673 --> 14:35.808
and, frankly, needs it
more than you.

14:35.842 --> 14:37.110
He needs my Chairry?

14:37.144 --> 14:38.378
He can't have my keytar.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.447
Gleb needs
my Nintendo Power Pad?

14:40.480 --> 14:41.881
You mean Nintendo blanket.

14:41.915 --> 14:43.183
This is crazy!

14:43.216 --> 14:45.018
What's he gonna do with
a lacrosse stick?

14:45.052 --> 14:46.819
Is perfect for
scooping up rodent

14:46.853 --> 14:48.288
or fighting bat.

14:48.321 --> 14:49.522
Not cool, Pops!

14:49.556 --> 14:52.960
He can't just take my "WKRP
in Cincinnati" record player!

14:52.993 --> 14:54.361
Is not for making pancake?

14:54.394 --> 14:57.197
No. It's for living out
radio workplace fantasies.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.665
And if I have to explain
that to you,

14:58.698 --> 14:59.866
it's clear you don't
deserve it.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.334
He deserves it
more than you.

15:01.368 --> 15:04.537
Okay, I think if we just
calm down and take a breath,

15:04.571 --> 15:07.907
we'd all realize that
Gleb can't take my
GI Joe Space Shuttle

15:07.941 --> 15:09.542
and Snoopy Sno-Cone Maker!

15:09.576 --> 15:11.444
I need those to live!

15:11.478 --> 15:13.046
I think that's
the problem.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.714
Fine! We admit it.

15:14.747 --> 15:17.717
We're selfish kids
and we don't know
how good we got it.

15:17.750 --> 15:21.054
Now give me back
my WWF Wrestling Ring,

15:21.088 --> 15:24.057
or I will cry right here,
right now.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.725
You learned nothing.

15:25.758 --> 15:29.062
All I wanted to do was show
you kids where I came from.

15:29.096 --> 15:32.065
It was my fault for
thinking you'd care.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.203
Here. Take your
dog snow machine.

15:36.236 --> 15:37.870
We have plenty of snow
in Russia.

15:37.904 --> 15:39.206
ADULT ADAM: Pops was right.

15:39.239 --> 15:40.573
We really did need
to take a long,

15:40.607 --> 15:42.242
hard look at ourselves.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.677
Meanwhile, my mom was looking
for some new friends.

15:44.711 --> 15:47.380
Hey, there's my Mentas!

15:47.414 --> 15:49.349
Mentas?
Mentas.

15:49.382 --> 15:50.883
You know, men yentas

15:50.917 --> 15:52.019
who are friends also.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.086
I just coined it.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.187
Well, un-coin it.

15:54.221 --> 15:55.955
What are you doing
at Bill's house?

15:55.989 --> 15:57.924
Sure, I'd love to
hang out with you.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.459
Thanks. (CLEARS THROAT)

15:59.492 --> 16:02.595
So... (CHUCKLES)

16:02.629 --> 16:04.064
What's on tap for today?

16:04.097 --> 16:05.465
Watching the big sports event?

16:05.498 --> 16:06.566
Terrible game.

16:06.599 --> 16:07.700
It's unwatchable.

16:07.734 --> 16:08.935
Maybe we should have brunch.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.103
You boys look hungry.

16:10.137 --> 16:12.139
Got it covered.
Wing helmet.

16:12.172 --> 16:13.240
I think I'll pass.

16:13.273 --> 16:14.307
More for us.

16:14.341 --> 16:15.742
So, this is your
entire day, huh?

16:15.775 --> 16:18.778
Sure.
Sitting on your ass,
eating helmet wings?

16:18.811 --> 16:20.547
Sure.
That's what Bill wanted.

16:20.580 --> 16:21.914
It is his birthday and all.

16:21.948 --> 16:23.816
For God's sakes,
it's his birthday?

16:23.850 --> 16:25.685
Did you at least
get him a gift?

16:25.718 --> 16:27.720
Of course he did.
Wing helmet.

16:27.754 --> 16:29.156
Show her the wing helmet
again, Mur.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.757
I don't think she got
a close enough look.

16:30.790 --> 16:33.326
Wing helmet.
I've seen the wing helmet.

16:33.360 --> 16:36.063
Hey, what's going on here?
It's Sunday.

16:36.096 --> 16:37.330
Why aren't you out
eating quiche

16:37.364 --> 16:39.632
with the ladies who walk
in front of my TV?

16:39.666 --> 16:42.335
You know, the ones whose,
uh, hair shadows I see
in the dining room.

16:42.369 --> 16:44.737
I know who you mean.

16:44.771 --> 16:49.676
And they don't wanna see me
'cause they said I'm selfish.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.444
And they're right.

16:51.478 --> 16:53.313
I've been a bad friend.

16:55.815 --> 16:56.949
Enjoy your game.

16:58.218 --> 16:59.886
Sorry to bother you.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.122
Oh, boy.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.259
ADULT ADAM:
The Frentas called out my mom
for being selfish.

17:06.293 --> 17:08.628
Luckily, Beverly had a Menta
in her corner.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.363
Ladies, it seems
we have a visitor.

17:10.397 --> 17:11.998
This will only take a second.

17:12.031 --> 17:15.202
Uh, Marcie, Shelly, Tabitha...

17:15.235 --> 17:16.769
Um, I'm sorry,
I forgot your name.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.438
You've actually forgotten
all our names.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.540
And if Beverly sent you,
you can tell her...

17:20.573 --> 17:21.841
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

17:21.874 --> 17:23.276
She did not send me.

17:23.310 --> 17:25.312
I came on my own
to let you guys know

17:25.345 --> 17:26.846
what a great friend she is.

17:26.879 --> 17:28.481
Who only wants to talk
about herself.

17:28.515 --> 17:32.219
Yes. But to me, she only
talks about you guys.

17:32.252 --> 17:35.522
Murray, it's sweet you're here
and honestly surprising

17:35.555 --> 17:38.591
to see you out of your chair,
but we know it's not true.

17:38.625 --> 17:39.892
Oh, but it is true.

17:39.926 --> 17:42.162
She was so jazzed
when Jimothy

17:42.195 --> 17:44.063
won that Flower Grower
of the Year Award.

17:44.097 --> 17:46.199
It's Charles, and, um,
when I mentioned it to her,

17:46.233 --> 17:47.667
she didn't seem to care.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.569
But she does care.

17:49.602 --> 17:52.004
And you, uh, Cindy?

17:52.038 --> 17:53.340
Your place in Florida?

17:53.373 --> 17:55.642
She's doing everything she can
to get me down there.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.210
It's Essie.
And really?

17:57.244 --> 17:58.445
And you, Patty,

17:58.478 --> 18:01.248
she cannot stop talking
about your son Stevie

18:01.281 --> 18:04.717
and how he can go to any
Ivy League School
that he wants.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.919
It's Geoff.
But that's sweet.

18:06.953 --> 18:09.422
Look, I know she talks
a lot about her family.

18:09.456 --> 18:12.024
But to her, you're family.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.063
Wow.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.898
What's all this?

18:18.931 --> 18:21.634
Well, we were hoping
you might like
a little brunch.

18:22.402 --> 18:23.870
But you don't need me.

18:23.903 --> 18:27.207
And why would you?
I haven't been there for you.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.108
And I know I always
talk about my life,

18:29.142 --> 18:34.947
but it's just because
I envy you all
in so many ways.

18:34.981 --> 18:37.217
I just want to be
as amazing as you are.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.652
No. You are amazing.

18:39.686 --> 18:41.053
Now, I don't know
if you've heard,

18:41.087 --> 18:42.622
but you're writing a cookbook.

18:42.655 --> 18:44.257
Everybody's talking
about it.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.126
Well, good.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.862
Because I'm gonna need those
recipes you offered up.

18:49.896 --> 18:51.898
I'm gonna put them
front and center.

18:51.931 --> 18:53.400
Really?

18:53.433 --> 18:55.235
Of course.

18:55.268 --> 18:58.238
I mean, yes, it's
a Beverly Goldberg Cookbook,

18:58.271 --> 19:01.541
but who's Beverly Goldberg
without her Frentas?

19:01.574 --> 19:04.544
ADULT ADAM:
With that, my mom got
her best friends back.

19:04.577 --> 19:06.246
All it took was a little help

19:06.279 --> 19:08.080
from the most unlikely
of places.

19:08.114 --> 19:11.117
Thanks to my dad,
the Frentas finally realized

19:11.150 --> 19:14.587
that when it came to my mom,
they were family, too.

19:15.087 --> 19:17.557
Wow.
Is that you?

19:17.590 --> 19:18.891
Doesn't matter.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.293
No, it does.

19:20.327 --> 19:21.428
You're right.

19:21.461 --> 19:22.929
We're stupid and selfish

19:22.962 --> 19:25.598
and have no idea
how good we have it.

19:25.632 --> 19:29.269
Look, I didn't want you to
feel bad about what you have,

19:29.302 --> 19:34.140
but we all dreamed of coming
here to start a new life.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.009
Well, we really are grateful
that we have a grandfather

19:37.043 --> 19:38.678
who was brave enough
to go look for one.

19:39.312 --> 19:40.947
Thank you.

19:40.980 --> 19:44.183
But I'm not the one
you have to apologize to.

19:46.219 --> 19:49.456
ADULT ADAM: In the end,
sometimes the best
way to say you're sorry

19:49.489 --> 19:51.224
is to start over.

19:52.359 --> 19:53.593
You're packing?

19:53.626 --> 19:55.462
But your trip's not over
for another week.

19:55.495 --> 19:57.864
I think is nothing
to see here.

19:57.897 --> 20:00.132
You may be wrong about that.

20:02.435 --> 20:03.703
Is tickets?

20:03.736 --> 20:05.472
To the Phillies game.

20:05.505 --> 20:08.675
We wanted to show you America
can be pretty awesome.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.110
* Standing tall

20:11.143 --> 20:14.281
* On the wings of my dream

20:14.314 --> 20:16.516
ADULT ADAM:
Gleb ended up having
the best trip of his life.

20:16.549 --> 20:17.650
And 'cause of Pops,

20:17.684 --> 20:20.987
we made memories that
would last a lifetime.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.622
That's the thing about family.

20:22.655 --> 20:23.856
You'll find that if you just

20:23.890 --> 20:25.157
take the time
to get to know them,

20:25.191 --> 20:27.594
they can go
from being perfect strangers

20:27.627 --> 20:29.228
to people you really love.

20:29.262 --> 20:32.532
* It's my life, my dream

20:32.565 --> 20:36.569
* Nothing's gonna
stop me now *

20:43.676 --> 20:44.777
(DING)

20:46.413 --> 20:47.680
(DING)

20:48.948 --> 20:50.883
This American fashion
make no sense.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.585
Those are Z Cavariccis.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.587
They're the coolest
in trouser technology.

20:54.621 --> 20:56.889
But why must there
be two belts?

20:56.923 --> 20:59.592
'Cause two is always
better than one.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.994
Just like wings
on an airplane
or a Twix.

21:02.028 --> 21:05.064
Gleb not sure he can pull off
LL Cool J hat.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.400
Oh, you will
with these bad boys.

21:08.801 --> 21:11.037
But you see much less
with these.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.372
It's not about seeing.

21:12.405 --> 21:13.906
It's about being seen.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.274
It seems like ugly fad

21:15.308 --> 21:17.344
which will not stand
test of time, yes?

21:17.377 --> 21:22.382
Trust us, G, the way you look
right now will always be cool.

21:22.415 --> 21:23.716
Always.

21:25.452 --> 21:26.453
BARRY: There we go.
