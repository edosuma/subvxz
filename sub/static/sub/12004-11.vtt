00:06.470 --> 00:08.239
<I>Previously on "Switched at birth"...

00:08.293 --> 00:09.788
You took home someone else's baby

00:09.789 --> 00:11.527
and another family took home yours.

00:11.528 --> 00:14.265
Does anybody know where
this other child might be?

00:14.266 --> 00:16.664
I'm so glad you found it!

00:16.665 --> 00:19.261
- Who's my father?
- The guy who took off when Daphne was little

00:19.262 --> 00:20.894
and hasn't been in touch since.

00:20.895 --> 00:23.393
Mom, this is Angelo Sorrento.

00:23.394 --> 00:24.954
- Hi.
- Who are you again?

00:24.955 --> 00:27.313
- This is my father.
- You are not welcome in Bay's life,

00:27.314 --> 00:30.102
- you have nothing to do with her!
- We are playing East West Fest

00:30.103 --> 00:31.615
- in St. Louis.
- Awesome!

00:31.616 --> 00:34.001
- Did you know my lawsuit is tanking?
- No.

00:34.002 --> 00:36.078
- But I know something you don't.
- And what's that?

00:36.079 --> 00:37.858
The nurse assigned to our babies that night

00:37.859 --> 00:39.192
worked 48 hours straight.

00:39.193 --> 00:43.121
There is one person who's
always been there for me.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.429
Emmett.

00:48.360 --> 00:50.051
- Bye!
- Road trip!

00:50.052 --> 00:52.587
You didn't want me to be with Liam,
so I broke up with him.

00:52.588 --> 00:54.466
But I'm not giving up on Emmett.

00:57.902 --> 00:59.887
He's moving here.

01:04.566 --> 01:08.184
Angelo... he's moving to K.C.

01:10.733 --> 01:13.132
Moving. Is that right?

01:13.133 --> 01:14.668
Can you see me?

01:14.843 --> 01:16.040
Here.

01:27.687 --> 01:30.421
Okay, it's my conversation!

01:31.626 --> 01:33.179
There's a family meeting right now.

01:33.180 --> 01:34.271
Living room.

01:35.669 --> 01:37.311
Okay, give me a sec.

01:39.697 --> 01:44.400
I gotta go. But I miss you.

01:57.970 --> 02:01.408
Okay, we need to go over some
ground rules. Daphne, ground rules.

02:01.409 --> 02:04.320
Number one: he cannot come to this house.

02:04.321 --> 02:06.864
Number two: he can't be
alone with Bay or Daphne.

02:06.865 --> 02:09.580
Number three: all phone calls
with him will be monitored.

02:09.580 --> 02:11.404
- He's not on parole!
- He is with me.

02:11.405 --> 02:13.795
I just want to say I had no idea
that he was going to do this...

02:13.796 --> 02:15.283
I don't know why he has to be here at all.

02:15.284 --> 02:17.073
What do you want to do,
ban him from the city?

02:17.074 --> 02:17.846
Girls, stop!

02:22.391 --> 02:23.657
- every single time I...
- Yes, I am!

02:23.658 --> 02:26.019
- I know nothing about this guy.
- But Regina does!

02:26.020 --> 02:29.864
- Yes nothing she's said so far has put as at ease.
- I know him too.

02:29.865 --> 02:32.502
I'm happy to help.
Anything you need from me, John.

02:32.503 --> 02:33.087
- Thank you, Adriana.
- Mom,

02:33.087 --> 02:34.785
you're gonna give them the wrong impression about him.

02:34.787 --> 02:37.054
- I'm on John's side on this one.
- So am I.

02:37.055 --> 02:40.858
- There are no sides!
- Both: Oh, there are sides!

02:43.741 --> 02:46.754
Well, he invited to a jazz club
and I'm not canceling.

02:47.601 --> 02:50.508
Fine, make it a table for three.

02:50.509 --> 02:52.053
Because I'm coming.

02:55.108 --> 02:58.634
♪ Go-ooo ♪

02:58.635 --> 03:00.840
♪ But she gonna get melted ♪

03:00.841 --> 03:04.164
♪ Fast or slow-www ♪

03:04.165 --> 03:06.543

03:06.544 --> 03:08.463
♪ And she gonna get... ♪

03:13.656 --> 03:14.877
There's something wrong here.

03:15.304 --> 03:16.772
We're supposed to open
for the cold war kids.

03:16.773 --> 03:19.119
They wouldn't put
the cold war kids way out here.

03:19.140 --> 03:21.306
Yeah, uh, about that.

03:21.948 --> 03:23.708
- Wilke?
- Now before you freak out.

03:23.709 --> 03:26.654
Dude, you tricked me to get us out here?!

03:26.655 --> 03:29.994
- That is not cool, man.
- We will open for the cold war kids someday.

03:29.995 --> 03:34.040
- Just not this weekend.
- Why do I unstop believing your crap?!

03:34.041 --> 03:35.963
We're not opening for the cold war kids.

03:36.833 --> 03:39.705
Uh, we're not...

03:40.697 --> 03:42.793
Hey, relax! We are playing.

03:42.794 --> 03:44.396
We've got a perfectly good stage here.

03:44.397 --> 03:46.537
- We've got...
- We've got a terrible time slot!

03:46.538 --> 03:48.844
We're playing up against Arcade Fire.

03:48.845 --> 03:50.375
No one's going to trek out to Siberia

03:50.376 --> 03:52.558
when Arcade Fire's playing
on the freaking main stage!

03:52.559 --> 03:54.405
Kennish, get a hold of yourself.
It's good experience.

03:54.406 --> 03:57.599
It's great exposure,
plus the sun is shining.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.599
We've got music, hemp bracelets,

03:59.600 --> 04:02.527
corn dogs. Chill out and see the bright side.

04:02.528 --> 04:04.746
- Okay?
- "D" stage.

04:05.721 --> 04:08.240
You really believed we had the spot
for the cold war kids?

04:08.251 --> 04:09.247
Yeah.

04:10.069 --> 04:12.465
Man, I'm better than I thought.

04:17.136 --> 04:19.177
Hi. Come in.

04:22.474 --> 04:24.448
Daphne, um,

04:24.536 --> 04:27.672
this just came out in closed caption.

04:27.673 --> 04:32.848
It contains "The unedited
convent massacre scene."

04:34.021 --> 04:35.872
I didn't know you liked horror movies.

04:35.873 --> 04:39.136
I haven't seen one since I was your age.

04:39.739 --> 04:41.609
"Amityville horror."

04:41.666 --> 04:45.551
And it wasn't nearly as scary
as the boy I saw it with.

04:45.905 --> 04:48.153
So Toby's gone,

04:48.154 --> 04:51.071
and Bay's, you know, out,

04:51.072 --> 04:55.065
so I just thought that you and me,
we could watch a movie.

04:55.165 --> 04:55.915
Together?

04:56.967 --> 04:59.186
Eat caramel popcorn,

04:59.556 --> 05:02.288
nuns with chainsaws. Wreeee!

05:03.195 --> 05:05.316
- What do you think?
- Sure yeah, we could do that.

05:05.317 --> 05:06.141
Yay!

05:07.290 --> 05:08.746
Okay, I'll see you.

05:16.652 --> 05:20.092
Thanks, I can never get the right hand
it's always a disaster.

05:20.587 --> 05:21.667
Perfect.

05:24.574 --> 05:28.617
So it looks like my dad was actually serious
about tagging along tonight.

05:29.103 --> 05:31.012
He's just being protective.

05:31.013 --> 05:33.730
It's humiliating. Like I'm five years old.

05:33.730 --> 05:35.776
I mean, how Angelo and I
are supposed to get to know each other

05:35.777 --> 05:39.048
if my dad is just sitting
there glaring at him?

05:39.049 --> 05:42.309
- He's not going to do that.
- Then what's the point?

05:42.310 --> 05:45.397
Angelo's not gonna kidnap me,
you know that.

05:46.272 --> 05:50.435
So can you tell my dad that is unfair
and unnecessary and kind of creepy?

05:50.450 --> 05:53.900
This is between you and John.
I can't interfere.

05:53.901 --> 05:56.386
Okay, Daphne gets access
to my dad every single day,

05:56.387 --> 05:59.206
but I have to schedule
time through my parents?

05:59.311 --> 06:00.226
And then they're monitoring

06:00.227 --> 06:02.898
him like he's in prison. How is that fair?

06:04.875 --> 06:08.523
I just don't think my opinion
matters much to anyone,

06:08.524 --> 06:10.826
especially your dad.

06:11.642 --> 06:13.755
Can you at least try?

06:19.804 --> 06:21.777
Hi, Amanda. I wasn't expecting you.

06:21.778 --> 06:23.776
John's not here, he's at the office.

06:25.057 --> 06:28.056
Look, that nurse... the one Angelo found...

06:28.057 --> 06:30.734
She's willing to meet with us
next week to go over her story.

06:30.735 --> 06:32.220
So she's sticking with it... that

06:32.221 --> 06:33.741
the hospital forced her
to work a double shift?

06:33.742 --> 06:36.733
- Apparently.
- So that's good, right,

06:36.734 --> 06:40.509
- for our case?
- Kathryn, I know John wants this to be true.

06:40.510 --> 06:41.684
We all want it to be true.

06:41.685 --> 06:44.520
But I wouldn't be doing my
job if I didn't tell you

06:44.521 --> 06:46.626
my gut says there's
something fishy about it.

06:46.627 --> 06:49.911
She's a single mom on a nurse's salary,

06:49.912 --> 06:53.049
if Angelo promised her a cut of
a multimillion-dollar lawsuit

06:53.050 --> 06:55.088
for providing key testimony...

06:55.435 --> 06:57.501
That would be hard for
anyone to turn down.

06:57.502 --> 07:00.553
Well, then we'll find out when
we speak with her next week.

07:00.554 --> 07:03.843
We will. I just think we need
to walk into that meeting

07:03.844 --> 07:06.202
as skeptically as possible... all of us.

07:06.203 --> 07:08.458
- Of course.
- I want to make sure your voice is heard...

07:08.459 --> 07:10.972
- if you had a different opinion.
- Well, my husband and I

07:10.973 --> 07:14.842
- have equal voices when it comes to this lawsuit.
- Good.

07:16.853 --> 07:19.862
Here's her file. Read it through
and I'll see you monday.

07:35.425 --> 07:36.418
Hi.

07:37.397 --> 07:39.579
Hey! Everything okay?

07:39.580 --> 07:42.203
- Are the girls okay?
- Yeah.

07:42.204 --> 07:45.172
I just actually have
this coupon for 10% off.

07:45.173 --> 07:47.622
But I think it might be expired.

07:48.838 --> 07:51.538
- I think I can help you with that.
- Perfect.

07:52.357 --> 07:55.015
Um, okay, uh, look,

07:55.016 --> 07:58.129
I know that you are worried about Bay,

07:58.130 --> 08:01.779
but I think if you insist on tagging along

08:01.780 --> 08:03.109
every time she's with Angelo,

08:03.110 --> 08:06.261
it's just going to make
things uncomfortable.

08:06.526 --> 08:10.897
And make her resentful... of you.

08:10.898 --> 08:12.463
And I would hate to see that happen.

08:12.464 --> 08:15.349
He's already hurt Daphne.
I'm just trying to protect Bay.

08:15.350 --> 08:18.914
I get it. I just think
that Bay is old enough

08:18.915 --> 08:21.354
that she has to form
her own opinion of him.

08:21.355 --> 08:24.801
And you and I

08:24.802 --> 08:27.912
both need to give her
the space to do that.

08:29.116 --> 08:31.540
I'd just feel better
if somebody was there.

08:33.544 --> 08:34.923
Will you go?

08:38.818 --> 08:42.441
Hey. I'm making eggplant parmesan tonight.

08:42.442 --> 08:44.168
Do you want a salad too?

08:44.169 --> 08:47.313
Actually, nothing for me.

08:49.354 --> 08:53.271
Instead of John going to that
club with Bay and Angelo,

08:53.779 --> 08:55.222
I'm going.

08:57.287 --> 08:58.981
What is this, a date?

08:58.982 --> 09:02.168
- Of course not.
- I don't understand.

09:02.169 --> 09:04.196
How can you encourage Bay

09:04.197 --> 09:06.711
to get to know him when
you know who he is?

09:06.712 --> 09:11.180
Wait, I think I might have painted
too harsh a portrait of him.

09:11.181 --> 09:14.825
What does that mean? You said
he walked out when I went deaf.

09:14.826 --> 09:18.014
Well, he doesn't see it that way.

09:18.076 --> 09:19.193
You've talked about this?!

09:19.194 --> 09:20.351
For a second.

09:20.352 --> 09:23.309
Honey, it's complicated.
There were good years.

09:23.310 --> 09:25.452
You're completely changing your story!

09:25.453 --> 09:27.342
Okay, I know it sounds like that...

09:27.343 --> 09:29.676
It's like he brainwashed you or something.

09:29.677 --> 09:31.043
Or Bay did.

09:32.278 --> 09:33.871
I tried to keep it simple

09:33.872 --> 09:35.396
because I thought it
would be better for you,

09:35.397 --> 09:39.044
and now I see it might
have been a mistake.

09:39.045 --> 09:42.293
Oh, and suddenly he is this great guy

09:42.294 --> 09:43.599
and you're gonna go dancing with him.

09:43.600 --> 09:46.795
- It's not like that.
- I don't want you to see him!

09:46.874 --> 09:48.716
Why can't you just tell Bay no?

09:48.717 --> 09:51.773
- You know why.
- No, I don't.

09:51.907 --> 09:53.278
Because

09:53.913 --> 09:56.933
I'm her mother too.

10:23.704 --> 10:26.636
- Guitar Face, tomorrow at 2:00!
- Toby: Guitar Face!

10:26.637 --> 10:28.703
Hey. Guitar Face
newest alt pop sensation in K.C.

10:28.704 --> 10:31.670
- Check it out, "D" stage.
- Guitar Face... acid metal.

10:31.671 --> 10:34.436
- Guitar Face!
- Guitar Face... best K.C. ska, man.

10:34.437 --> 10:37.603
Guitar face, indie rock from K.C.!

10:37.604 --> 10:40.636
You guys are not indie rock.
You're garage pop, at best.

10:40.637 --> 10:44.536
Simone Sinclair! How are you?

10:44.537 --> 10:46.670
- Good.
- Hey, you want to help us hand some of these out?

10:46.671 --> 10:48.436
I did not drive all the way out here

10:48.437 --> 10:50.336
to help you pass out
your stickers. I'm sorry.

10:50.337 --> 10:52.736
Oh, come on.

10:52.737 --> 10:54.570
- hey.
- hey, Toby.

10:54.571 --> 10:56.403
I didn't know you were gonna be here.

10:56.404 --> 10:57.736
I didn't know you were going to be here.

10:58.693 --> 11:01.436
Simone, this is Emmett.
Emmett, this is Simone.

11:01.437 --> 11:03.436
Hello. Nice to meet you.

11:03.437 --> 11:04.770
Emmett is actually Bay's...

11:04.771 --> 11:07.469
Can I say?

11:07.470 --> 11:11.171
- Boyfriend.
- Oh, no kidding.

11:11.853 --> 11:14.469
Simone is one of Bay's...

11:14.470 --> 11:16.536
good friends. Well,

11:16.537 --> 11:18.770
used to be good friend... or...

11:18.771 --> 11:21.336
So I've been meaning to ask you guys,

11:21.337 --> 11:23.403
"Guitar Face"... what is that all about?

11:23.404 --> 11:24.262
It's the term my mom made

11:24.263 --> 11:25.670
up to describe my face when I'm playing.

11:25.671 --> 11:26.785
We couldn't name ourselves

11:26.786 --> 11:28.703
"Bass Face" because
that just sounds stupid.

11:28.704 --> 11:31.937
Right. What is the face?

11:32.737 --> 11:35.770
Nice. So where you guys playing?
I'm gonna come check you out.

11:35.771 --> 11:39.403
- The "D" stage.
- Oh, ouch.

11:39.404 --> 11:41.670
- Exactly.
- That's a hike, huh?

11:41.671 --> 11:44.636
- No, it's not that bad.
- It's Timbuktu.

11:44.637 --> 11:47.770
All right, I gotta run.
Helen Mirren's cleavage is playing.

11:47.771 --> 11:51.204
And now they are indie rock.

11:57.604 --> 12:00.603
Okay, so is this like too much?
Or too weird?

12:00.604 --> 12:03.436
Oh, honey, you don't have to impress him.

12:03.437 --> 12:04.601
Mom, didn't you want Daphne

12:04.602 --> 12:06.403
to think you were cool when you guys met?

12:06.404 --> 12:08.401
Yeah, but he's not going
to be judging you.

12:08.402 --> 12:09.503
You're his... daughter.

12:09.504 --> 12:12.503
- Mom.
- You're not gonna call him "Dad," are you?

12:12.504 --> 12:14.670
- Mom!
- You're not wearing that.

12:14.671 --> 12:16.536
Okay, I'll just... I'll take it off.

12:16.537 --> 12:17.684
No, I'm talking about the

12:17.685 --> 12:19.736
whole "Studs aplenty"
belted leather micro...

12:19.737 --> 12:23.004
Oh, he's not gonna look at
me like that. He's my dad.

12:25.637 --> 12:29.070
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah.

12:30.337 --> 12:32.570
- I think you look fantastic, honey.
- Yeah yes.

12:32.571 --> 12:35.336
And if you need me, you text me.

12:35.337 --> 12:37.937
- I won't need you.
- Mm-hmm.

12:39.737 --> 12:43.469
- Hi.
- Oh wow, you look beautiful.

12:43.470 --> 12:47.037
Oh, uh... I wasn't trying to.

12:48.337 --> 12:50.570
I mean, it's a club.
That's what you're supposed to wear.

12:50.571 --> 12:53.371
Okay, let's go.

12:53.771 --> 12:55.536
- Guitar Face.
- Check us out.

12:55.537 --> 12:57.570
Tomorrow at 2:00.

12:57.571 --> 12:58.571
Sweet.

13:02.504 --> 13:04.369
I know... $7 beer, crazy, right?

13:04.370 --> 13:06.736
But check out this line.
These dudes are cleaning up.

13:06.737 --> 13:09.536
We should change our names to
"Free Booze."

13:09.537 --> 13:11.599
So that way when they announce our band,

13:11.600 --> 13:14.004
it's "Free Booze on the 'D' stage!"

13:15.337 --> 13:17.436
Wilke, no.

13:17.437 --> 13:19.503
It's seriously the smartest
thing you have ever said.

13:19.504 --> 13:22.436
No, it's false advertising.
They'll stone us off the stage.

13:22.437 --> 13:25.904
They'll laugh and then we'll
win them over with our sound!

13:26.337 --> 13:28.603
- This is a terrible idea.
- No no.

13:28.604 --> 13:31.369
Don't listen to whatever
he is going to write.

13:31.370 --> 13:33.070
That's a bad idea.

14:02.437 --> 14:04.503
Hi. Gina, I didn't know you were coming.

14:04.504 --> 14:06.670
No no, just pretend I'm not here.
I am just chaperoning.

14:06.671 --> 14:08.636
This is your night.

14:08.637 --> 14:11.570
The two of you.

14:11.571 --> 14:13.970
I am not gonna say a word.

14:14.671 --> 14:17.536
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:17.537 --> 14:20.171
- Beautiful necklace.
- Oh thanks.

14:21.604 --> 14:23.736
Look at us...

14:23.737 --> 14:26.104
a family.

14:26.671 --> 14:28.703
Um...

14:28.704 --> 14:31.070
I'm starving.

14:41.604 --> 14:44.736
- Oh, you're going to so much trouble.
- Oh no, I love it.

14:44.737 --> 14:47.271
Do you wanna help?

14:48.737 --> 14:50.536
I was going to see if

14:50.537 --> 14:52.670
you wouldn't mind if we took a rain check.

14:52.671 --> 14:56.703
- Oh.
- The boys are playing at the festival tomorrow.

14:56.704 --> 15:00.469
I was going to drive out
there tonight in my new car.

15:00.470 --> 15:05.137
And I could really use
some time alone right now.

15:05.537 --> 15:07.403
Oh.

15:07.404 --> 15:10.004
Okay.

15:11.404 --> 15:13.336
- Are you mad?
- No.

15:13.337 --> 15:15.636
No no no, of course not.

15:15.637 --> 15:17.436
And plus Emmett's up there.

15:17.437 --> 15:20.171
I just wanted to check in on him.

15:21.537 --> 15:24.303
Do you know how to get there?

15:24.304 --> 15:26.670
Do you need anything? Gas?

15:26.671 --> 15:28.403
- Money?
- I'm fine.

15:28.404 --> 15:31.336
My mom asked all the same questions.

15:31.337 --> 15:33.736
And I'll just crash with Emmett or Toby.

15:33.737 --> 15:35.670
Well, drive safe.

15:35.671 --> 15:38.137
And text me when you get there.

15:39.604 --> 15:41.336
- Bye.
- Bye.

15:41.337 --> 15:43.237
Oh, did you want to take...

15:49.537 --> 15:52.469
Your mom ate the crabcakes
here by the dozen

15:52.470 --> 15:54.336
when she was pregnant with you.

15:54.337 --> 15:56.603
I was afraid you were going
to come out with eight legs.

15:56.604 --> 15:58.736
So you guys came here a lot?

15:58.737 --> 16:01.736
Yeah, there was this horn player

16:01.737 --> 16:05.469
that was completely obsessed with her.
What was his name?

16:05.470 --> 16:07.469
- Zeke? Zeb?
- Zane.

16:07.470 --> 16:10.303
- Zane.
- And it was only because you were always late

16:10.304 --> 16:12.271
that he came by so much.

16:12.671 --> 16:16.037
She was stunning back then.

16:16.470 --> 16:18.369
Back then?

16:18.370 --> 16:21.337
Gina, you're still gorgeous.

16:24.671 --> 16:27.670
Enough about the old times.
I want to hear about you.

16:27.671 --> 16:30.369
Boyfriend? Girlfriend?

16:30.370 --> 16:32.304
Uh, boyfriend.

16:34.571 --> 16:37.303
It's this guy, his name's Emmett.

16:37.304 --> 16:39.303
- Emmett?
- Mm-hmm.

16:39.304 --> 16:40.603
Wait, Daphne's Emmett?

16:40.604 --> 16:43.303
He doesn't really belong to her.

16:43.304 --> 16:44.736
No, of course not.

16:44.737 --> 16:48.336
Wow, I... I never would have guessed that.

16:48.337 --> 16:50.670
But I'm happy for you.

16:50.671 --> 16:53.436
- Thanks.
- Oh, thank you.

16:53.437 --> 16:55.469
It's the pinot. Wanna try?

16:55.470 --> 16:58.503
Um, I don't drink anymore.

16:58.504 --> 17:00.736
Oh right. Bay told me.

17:00.737 --> 17:02.536
I forgot.

17:02.537 --> 17:05.936
Bay told you and you forgot?

17:06.404 --> 17:08.336
I guess I never saw you as the A.A. type.

17:08.337 --> 17:11.403
- What type is that?
- You know... the rules, the meetings,

17:11.404 --> 17:14.368
the "Higher power,"
you know? It's not really you.

17:14.855 --> 17:17.403
- What can I say?
- I...

17:17.404 --> 17:19.236
Sorry, um...

17:19.237 --> 17:20.603
- can you take it back?
- No no!

17:20.604 --> 17:23.502
It's fine, it's fine.
I'm around it all the time.

17:23.503 --> 17:25.736
She says she doesn't mind,
but she really minds.

17:25.737 --> 17:27.336
If I say I don't mind, I don't mind.

17:27.337 --> 17:28.770
Okay, this is a test. She does that.

17:28.771 --> 17:30.141
And then if I don't send it back,

17:30.142 --> 17:31.503
she will say I've being selfish.

17:31.504 --> 17:32.287
What are you talking about?

17:32.288 --> 17:33.670
Don't tell me you don't
remember all those times

17:33.671 --> 17:34.779
you were telling me it's okay

17:34.780 --> 17:36.636
- for me to go out...
- If I say something, it's true.

17:36.637 --> 17:39.204
You don't have to question it.
Look where that got us.

17:41.604 --> 17:44.070
Excuse me.

17:45.537 --> 17:47.970
Excuse me.

18:02.012 --> 18:04.443
Daphne really likes this?

18:04.444 --> 18:08.210
I don't know. Maybe Regina
likes horror movies.

18:08.211 --> 18:11.110
Maybe it was like a thing in their house.

18:11.714 --> 18:12.714
Whoa.

18:13.637 --> 18:16.377
Sometimes it's just so obvious
that we didn't raise her.

18:16.378 --> 18:19.410
Come on, we raised Toby.
He's doing things all the time

18:19.411 --> 18:22.176
that make me wonder how
the hell he's related to me.

18:22.177 --> 18:25.443
- Whew.
- I just wish that when she was upset,

18:25.444 --> 18:28.110
she'd want to be with us.

18:28.111 --> 18:30.343
Well, gee,

18:30.344 --> 18:32.176
go to rock festival

18:32.177 --> 18:34.011
or stay home with the parents?

18:34.012 --> 18:36.043
What would I have done?

18:36.044 --> 18:37.410
It's all because of that Angelo.

18:37.411 --> 18:41.369
He barges into our lives and
suddenly there's all this chaos.

18:41.369 --> 18:44.922
I can't believe that our lives
are tangled up with that woman

18:44.922 --> 18:46.988
and all of her mistakes.

18:47.443 --> 18:48.443
Wow.

18:50.583 --> 18:52.888
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

18:52.889 --> 18:54.188
No, it's all right.

18:54.700 --> 18:57.788
Hey, we're meeting that
nurse on monday... 3:00 P.M.

18:57.789 --> 19:00.888
- John...
- Brizia Mun... is it Brizia or Britzia?

19:00.889 --> 19:03.921
You do remember what our
lawyer told us, right?

19:03.922 --> 19:05.821
Whatever. I can't wait to
shake that woman's hand.

19:05.822 --> 19:07.821
If that nurse is lying and we sign on

19:07.822 --> 19:10.888
to a false document, we could go to jail.

19:10.889 --> 19:12.955
Sweetie, I looked over the affidavit.

19:12.956 --> 19:14.788
It looks very credible to me.

19:14.789 --> 19:17.088
So what do you say we turn this off,

19:17.089 --> 19:19.522
and go read instead?

19:23.831 --> 19:25.723
Okay then.

20:31.222 --> 20:34.789
So I'm sure that was strange for you.

20:35.523 --> 20:38.221
He just pushes these buttons with me

20:38.222 --> 20:39.422
and I lose it...

20:39.423 --> 20:42.288
which I'm not proud of.

20:43.202 --> 20:46.023
I don't know if you're like
that with anyone, but...

20:49.122 --> 20:50.522
anyway,

20:50.523 --> 20:52.522
if you want to do that again...

20:52.523 --> 20:55.156
Maybe I can ask my mom to come.

20:57.623 --> 21:00.156
Right.

21:11.487 --> 21:14.799
So why didn't you tell
me about you and Emmett?

21:15.843 --> 21:17.878
I don't know.

21:17.879 --> 21:20.824
I guess I just assumed Daphne told you.

21:20.855 --> 21:21.874
Daphne knows?

21:21.875 --> 21:23.268
Of course.

21:25.476 --> 21:26.810
Besides it's not exactly

21:26.811 --> 21:28.928
like you and I tell each other everything.

21:30.867 --> 21:31.956
Right.

21:33.779 --> 21:36.883
I better go. Good night.

21:38.599 --> 21:39.988
Night.

21:45.094 --> 21:47.864
Hey, sweetie. You okay?

21:49.016 --> 21:51.256
Yeah, dad, I am okay.

21:52.579 --> 21:56.027
Angelo called. He wants to take
you to the Kemper tomorrow.

21:56.028 --> 21:58.554
I guess everything went great, huh?

21:58.555 --> 22:00.938
- I guess.
- I know your mom's busy tomorrow.

22:00.939 --> 22:02.643
Maybe Adriana can take you.

22:02.644 --> 22:04.285
Or you could just lojack my phone

22:04.286 --> 22:05.815
- or chip me like a dog.
- Hey.

22:05.816 --> 22:08.521
Dad, just admit you're trying to
make it hard on me to see him.

22:08.522 --> 22:11.548
No, I am trying to do
my job as your father.

22:11.549 --> 22:12.699
Okay, I'm going to bed.

22:12.700 --> 22:13.832
I assume this means you do

22:13.833 --> 22:16.523
not want to go to the
Kemper tomorrow, right?

22:18.107 --> 22:21.324
- Right.
- Maybe you'd like to spend the day with me?

22:22.623 --> 22:24.343
Actually, Toby just texted me.

22:24.344 --> 22:26.343
He really wants me to go
out there and support him.

22:26.344 --> 22:28.737
So I think I'm just gonna
head out tomorrow morning.

22:28.738 --> 22:31.089
I wish I'd known, I would've
had Daphne wait for you.

22:32.895 --> 22:34.031
What?

22:34.251 --> 22:36.861
Daphne went out to
the East West thing tonight.

22:38.645 --> 22:39.954
Why?

22:40.132 --> 22:42.324
I don't know.
To see Emmett, I guess.

23:40.588 --> 23:41.658
Whoa.

23:41.836 --> 23:42.972
What's going on?

23:46.278 --> 23:48.760
Uh, dude, you're with Bay.

23:49.174 --> 23:51.349
Daphne, what are you doing?

23:51.612 --> 23:53.666
Nothing. I just came to talk to him.

23:53.667 --> 23:56.899
It's 7:00 in the morning,
you're coming out of his tent.

23:57.011 --> 23:59.572
It was late. I was tired.

23:59.648 --> 24:01.178
You know what, forget it.

24:01.243 --> 24:02.546
This was the stupidest idea.

24:02.547 --> 24:03.987
I don't know what I was thinking.

24:14.482 --> 24:16.476
- Hey, stop.
- I can't believe you think

24:16.477 --> 24:17.195
I'm the type of girl

24:17.196 --> 24:19.083
who would sleep with
someone else's boyfriend.

24:19.116 --> 24:21.987
Okay, I'm sorry, okay? I overreacted.

24:21.988 --> 24:23.970
It's just wired in or something.

24:23.971 --> 24:26.019
I'm just so protective of Bay.

24:26.148 --> 24:28.146
She's my little sister, what can I say?

24:30.263 --> 24:32.727
Oh. Right.

24:33.360 --> 24:35.116
It doesn't matter. I'm going anyway.

24:35.117 --> 24:39.041
Stop. Come on, we're playing today.

24:39.540 --> 24:43.059
You gotta come watch us. Please?

24:43.688 --> 24:45.084
For your big brother?

25:03.596 --> 25:07.212
Ms. Munoz? Are you Ms. Munoz?

25:07.999 --> 25:10.403
- Yeah?
- My name is Kathryn Kennish.

25:10.404 --> 25:12.724
I had a baby here 16 years ago.

25:14.039 --> 25:15.690
You said you were working here that night.

25:15.691 --> 25:17.260
I can't talk to you here.

25:27.116 --> 25:28.987
Surprise!

25:31.284 --> 25:32.467
I missed you.

25:34.705 --> 25:35.835
Well, hey!

25:36.647 --> 25:37.944
Hey!

25:38.328 --> 25:40.431
Oh yeah, I heard you were coming here!

25:40.432 --> 25:42.496
I thought I should stop by.

25:42.611 --> 25:44.803
If it's a party, I should come too.

25:46.242 --> 25:48.195
Just came to support the guys.

25:50.323 --> 25:52.500
Just couldn't stay away, could you?

25:53.511 --> 25:55.412
I remember everything about that day...

25:55.413 --> 25:57.767
the seahorse wallpaper,
the cranberry juice

25:57.768 --> 25:59.386
and the nurse who took care of me.

25:59.387 --> 26:01.401
She was indian. I am sure of that.

26:01.487 --> 26:03.779
Then I'm sure you recall
that when you deliver a baby,

26:03.780 --> 26:05.934
- you have more than one nurse.
- Yes, I do.

26:06.255 --> 26:07.331
But I don't remember you.

26:07.332 --> 26:09.326
Well I can't control what you remember,
but I was there.

26:09.327 --> 26:10.497
Please!

26:12.116 --> 26:13.172
Get in.

26:15.871 --> 26:19.562
I remember being a new mom
and being so sleep-deprived

26:19.563 --> 26:20.727
that I couldn't even mix a bottle.

26:20.728 --> 26:22.575
If I was in charge of medication

26:22.576 --> 26:23.971
or I.D. bracelets...

26:23.972 --> 26:26.371
I'm sure you would've done
a much better job than me.

26:26.687 --> 26:29.855
Look, I just don't understand
why you didn't say no.

26:30.900 --> 26:32.699
Have you ever depended on a job?

26:32.700 --> 26:33.794
Because it's easy to judge

26:33.795 --> 26:35.351
from inside of a Mercedes.

26:35.352 --> 26:36.855
And I wasn't Norma Rae.

26:37.214 --> 26:38.796
You were taking care of infants.

26:38.797 --> 26:41.139
You had a responsibility to tell them

26:41.140 --> 26:43.555
if it wasn't safe to do your job...

26:44.399 --> 26:45.728
It probably wasn't even me!

26:45.729 --> 26:48.290
I am doing the right thing
by coming forward now.

26:48.291 --> 26:49.979
It's a little late, don't you think?

26:55.511 --> 26:57.067
You were having trouble nursing.

26:57.068 --> 26:58.644
You said it was your first time

26:58.839 --> 27:01.560
because your son was born with
a cleft and couldn't latch.

27:02.731 --> 27:05.164
- How do you know that?
- You told me.

27:06.615 --> 27:09.010
We had that fixed when
he was six weeks old.

27:09.011 --> 27:10.659
We didn't tell anyone.

27:11.971 --> 27:14.538
But wait... you must have
had hundreds of patients...

27:14.539 --> 27:16.459
How do you remember me?

27:19.570 --> 27:20.883
I was living at home then

27:20.884 --> 27:25.603
and your husband was
a big deal to my parents,

27:25.904 --> 27:27.474
especially my dad.

27:27.624 --> 27:29.338
He wanted details... what was he like?

27:29.339 --> 27:30.603
What were you like?

27:30.812 --> 27:32.379
He was a baseball star.

27:33.659 --> 27:34.515
So I made sure to hold

27:34.516 --> 27:36.437
the baby so I'd have
something to tell them.

27:38.539 --> 27:40.307
I remember taking her into the nursery

27:40.308 --> 27:43.553
and wondering what kind
of life she'd have.

27:44.254 --> 27:45.675
You were so pretty and sweet.

27:45.676 --> 27:50.653
And she would have everything
and it would be an easy life.

27:53.063 --> 27:55.799
I was kind of jealous of
a one-day-old. I know.

27:56.720 --> 27:58.368
I know it was silly.

28:00.476 --> 28:02.179
I remember putting her in her crib.

28:02.180 --> 28:04.275
And I thought it was the right one,

28:05.003 --> 28:06.332
but I was so tired.

28:06.333 --> 28:08.750
And I just... I remember being so tired.

28:12.431 --> 28:14.409
If it was me, I'm sorry.

28:16.082 --> 28:17.532
I'm so sorry.

28:23.798 --> 28:27.375
Bay: So we all go out to this jazz club

28:27.376 --> 28:30.166
and it goes from a family reunion

28:30.167 --> 28:32.888
to like a total meltdown in like three seconds.

28:33.219 --> 28:37.800
Apparently I am the spawn
of not one hothead,

28:38.378 --> 28:39.852
but two.

28:40.439 --> 28:42.951
- You're up.
- What can I get for you, my man?

28:43.243 --> 28:46.040
All right, you want green tomatillo
or red chile sauce?

28:46.800 --> 28:48.250
Tomatillo or chile, man?

28:48.251 --> 28:49.915
What's it gonna be, green or red?

28:51.195 --> 28:52.229
Hey, green or red?

28:52.230 --> 28:53.395
What's it gonna be? I got a line here.

28:53.396 --> 28:54.366
You guys are hungry, aren't you?

28:54.367 --> 28:56.928
You know, he'll just take the green.

28:56.975 --> 28:58.148
Great, green. There we go.

28:58.149 --> 29:00.549
Here you go, my man. Appreciate it. $4.

29:01.228 --> 29:02.315
There we go.

29:05.457 --> 29:06.866
More chips, more chips. Come on, let's go.

29:06.867 --> 29:08.371
What can I get for you, my man?

29:09.396 --> 29:13.732
- What's up, East West Fest?
- Whoo-hoo!

29:14.220 --> 29:16.206
All right, thanks for coming out, guys!

29:16.207 --> 29:18.583
We are Free Booze.

29:18.639 --> 29:20.878
- Free Booze!
- Whoo!

29:21.090 --> 29:23.020
Yeah, it's the name of our band.

29:24.399 --> 29:25.567
Kinda funny.

29:26.912 --> 29:27.870
Okay.

29:27.871 --> 29:28.992
Oh, hey hey!

29:30.575 --> 29:33.255
No no, we've got a great set for you guys.

29:33.256 --> 29:35.860
We've got a great set. Let's get it going.

29:36.440 --> 29:39.192
We want beer! We want beer!

Oh, sorry, bowl.

30:28.771 --> 30:29.859
Sorry.

30:33.916 --> 30:35.195
Kathryn?

30:36.292 --> 30:39.156
I went to meet that nurse Brizia today.

30:40.007 --> 30:40.670
What are you talking about?

30:40.671 --> 30:41.799
We're going to go see her on monday.

30:41.800 --> 30:45.246
I know. I'm sorry, I... just I went...

30:45.247 --> 30:47.742
Wait a second. You went and saw her?

30:48.563 --> 30:50.043
Without me? You hid this from me?

30:50.044 --> 30:52.354
I wanted to meet her myself
and make up my own mind.

30:52.355 --> 30:54.723
You know sometimes you railroad me, John.

30:56.408 --> 30:57.624
I railroad you?

31:07.308 --> 31:09.276
I don't... I don't mean to.

31:11.128 --> 31:12.039
I know.

31:13.127 --> 31:16.088
I need to learn how to
speak up for myself.

31:19.549 --> 31:20.965
So what happened?

31:21.360 --> 31:22.719
She's telling the truth.

31:23.639 --> 31:25.390
- She remembers us.
- This is great.

31:25.391 --> 31:27.135
No... well, maybe, but...

31:27.315 --> 31:29.478
I guess I was hoping that she was lying,

31:29.479 --> 31:33.287
and that we would find out
that Angelo had bribed her.

31:33.792 --> 31:34.927
Why?

31:37.024 --> 31:39.735
You know, when we found out
about the girls being switched

31:39.736 --> 31:42.792
I was never as angry as you,
you know that.

31:44.152 --> 31:47.176
And I think it's because
I just thought that it was

31:48.240 --> 31:49.443
meant to be.

31:49.444 --> 31:50.710
That it was...

31:51.718 --> 31:55.245
God's plan or something.
To bring us to Bay...

31:55.246 --> 32:00.653
To make us all stronger or something.

32:03.874 --> 32:05.652
But it was none of those things.

32:06.596 --> 32:10.068
It was just a big hospital
trying to save a little money.

32:12.068 --> 32:13.363
I know.

32:15.287 --> 32:17.799
Those sons of bitches.

32:23.580 --> 32:27.482
The good news is that
the people who stayed

32:27.483 --> 32:30.690
are your hardcore fans.

32:30.691 --> 32:32.686
Hey, I know you!

32:32.687 --> 32:34.770
You're the drummer from
that band that sucked!

32:34.771 --> 32:36.454
Hey, buddy, I was promised a drink!

32:36.455 --> 32:39.095
Whoa, he is deaf, you moron.
Leave him alone.

32:39.984 --> 32:41.328
Seriously?

32:56.114 --> 32:57.603
I said you were deaf.

33:22.788 --> 33:24.307
You bailed after like two seconds.

33:24.308 --> 33:25.508
Were we that bad?

33:32.092 --> 33:33.228
So what's the deal?

33:33.289 --> 33:34.905
I thought Edward had a thing for you.

33:36.336 --> 33:38.212
Emmett. Whatever.

33:42.491 --> 33:44.828
He's with Bay now. He's happy.

33:45.876 --> 33:46.916
Uh-huh.

33:48.136 --> 33:49.931
So you're out here

33:49.932 --> 33:51.586
staring out into the water all alone

33:51.587 --> 33:53.743
because you're so happy he's happy?

33:58.867 --> 34:00.708
I got a couple other things going on.

34:04.436 --> 34:05.476
I'm listening.

34:06.934 --> 34:08.088
It's okay.

34:10.636 --> 34:12.219
What, no smart comment?

34:12.422 --> 34:14.170
You got a shoulder for me to lean on.

34:14.170 --> 34:17.215
Or abs or some other body part?

34:18.147 --> 34:19.811
I really am listening.

34:26.592 --> 34:29.904
You know how there are some
people that love you so much

34:30.179 --> 34:33.362
every time you think about them,
you get happy?

34:34.391 --> 34:35.449
And then there are others

34:35.451 --> 34:38.235
that even the tiniest
reminder brings you down?

34:40.614 --> 34:43.766
That's my dad. I hate
even thinking about him.

34:44.687 --> 34:46.862
And he just moved back here, right?

34:51.543 --> 34:53.753
I hate Bay for wanting to get to know him.

34:54.422 --> 34:57.080
I hate my parents for not
being able to stop it.

34:57.992 --> 34:59.448
And I hate

35:00.096 --> 35:03.243
more than anything that I can't
even talk to the one person

35:03.244 --> 35:03.986
that I would normally

35:03.987 --> 35:07.244
talk to about all this
because Bay took him.

35:09.530 --> 35:12.850
So I'm just sitting on this beautiful dock

35:12.851 --> 35:17.796
on this beautiful day
hating the entire world.

35:26.907 --> 35:28.567
Aren't you glad you asked?

35:30.967 --> 35:32.871
Yeah, I am.

35:36.663 --> 35:39.120
I wish I could just turn
my brain off for a second.

35:39.121 --> 35:40.383
You know, just...

35:46.440 --> 35:47.975
Can I see your hearing aids?

35:48.371 --> 35:50.868
- What?
- Can you just take them out?

35:51.439 --> 35:54.403
Okay, but it doesn't turn off my brain,

35:54.404 --> 35:55.763
only my ears.

36:02.759 --> 36:05.719
Wilke, I'm gonna kill you!

36:05.859 --> 36:08.291
- Did it work?
- I can't hear you.

36:08.212 --> 36:11.233
- Did it work?
- Get in here now!

36:11.234 --> 36:12.402
All right, I'm coming.

36:23.004 --> 36:24.902
What would have happened
if I couldn't swim?!

36:25.151 --> 36:26.826
Well, I guess I'd have to save you.

36:42.922 --> 36:45.243
I'm sorry, okay?

36:46.187 --> 36:48.992
I was scared and I didn't know what to do.

36:59.476 --> 37:03.925
Okay, which part bothers you?
The hearing or the girl?

37:05.471 --> 37:08.337
You may have had this happen before,

37:08.338 --> 37:10.376
but I haven't.

37:10.377 --> 37:13.674
And you cannot get mad at me
for not knowing what to do!

37:16.730 --> 37:18.962
But as a sales hook it's okay?

37:20.875 --> 37:22.522
You didn't care when Wilke

37:22.523 --> 37:25.482
sold you guys as the band
with the deaf drummer.

37:26.037 --> 37:29.587
So how am I supposed to know the rules?

37:37.646 --> 37:38.985
I will.

37:44.646 --> 37:49.052
Okay, I have another question.

37:49.113 --> 37:50.431
The tamales?

37:52.387 --> 37:54.572
I know that you were mad

37:54.573 --> 37:57.830
that I ordered for you,
but I was just trying to help.

37:57.831 --> 38:01.143
And why is that not okay... to help?

38:01.144 --> 38:02.229
Excuse me.

38:13.147 --> 38:15.719
Pointing and texting and gesturing

38:15.720 --> 38:17.705
is how I connect to the world.

38:18.831 --> 38:20.683
So that guy had to stop

38:20.684 --> 38:24.057
and figure out how to engage
with me without talking.

38:24.798 --> 38:27.928
So what? He'll survive.

38:28.763 --> 38:31.642
If he's uncomfortable with me,
that's his problem.

38:32.095 --> 38:33.785
But most people aren't.

38:33.786 --> 38:35.173
They figure it out.

38:37.854 --> 38:39.149
I'm different.

38:39.950 --> 38:41.238
It's okay.

38:49.664 --> 38:50.945
Okay.

39:13.729 --> 39:15.271
I wish we didn't need Daphne.

39:52.680 --> 39:54.232
Not really.

39:54.965 --> 39:56.943
Wilke's making fart jokes

39:56.944 --> 40:00.227
and there's some drunk girls over there.

40:00.228 --> 40:01.480
They're being idiots.

40:08.371 --> 40:09.655
What do you mean?

40:21.883 --> 40:23.080
Yeah.

40:23.656 --> 40:25.306
It actually does.

40:41.442 --> 40:43.037
Who were you talking to?

40:43.124 --> 40:45.966
Um, just a client.
She wanted to reschedule.

40:45.967 --> 40:49.126
You were on for a long time. I knocked.

40:49.605 --> 40:51.037
Yeah, um,

40:51.038 --> 40:55.340
she just kept going on and
on about her boyfriend.

41:01.060 --> 41:02.439
It was Louise.

41:03.224 --> 41:05.144
I just wanted to talk through some things.

41:05.145 --> 41:08.047
He's here 48 hours and you're
on the phone with your sponsor.

41:08.048 --> 41:10.448
- It's not a big deal.
- And what did she say?

41:10.449 --> 41:12.706
Mom, I really don't want
to get into this right now.

41:12.707 --> 41:16.292
I know what she said.
You're supposed to ask yourself

41:16.293 --> 41:17.202
"Is this situation going to"

41:17.203 --> 41:20.701
"take me closer or farther
away from a drink?"

41:20.702 --> 41:22.787
And when we're talking
about you and Angelo...

41:22.788 --> 41:24.427
That was a long time ago.

41:24.428 --> 41:27.173
Because you've got two
girls to think about now.

41:28.451 --> 41:31.839
I am not gonna start drinking again.

41:33.930 --> 41:35.181
Okay?

41:43.166 --> 41:46.190
Hey, um, so

41:46.191 --> 41:49.052
how did it go with Angelo and my mom?

41:49.629 --> 41:51.650
It was incredibly weird.

41:52.072 --> 41:53.355
What do you mean?

41:55.542 --> 42:00.501
Okay, so this is what
life would've been like,

42:00.502 --> 42:02.164
but not really,

42:02.165 --> 42:05.425
'cause everything just
got totally screwed up

42:05.460 --> 42:09.283
and we will never really know.
And no matter how hard we try,

42:09.284 --> 42:13.113
or which family we are in, it still feels

42:13.114 --> 42:15.835
like all screwy.

42:15.836 --> 42:18.747
Or at least it does for me.

42:19.287 --> 42:22.066
Did you get any of that at all?

42:23.615 --> 42:25.120
Yeah.

42:25.315 --> 42:26.535
I got it.
