01:17.093 --> 01:19.357
Hey, do you need a menu?

01:24.100 --> 01:25.533
Are you okay?

01:26.035 --> 01:29.266
Do you want some food?
There's a wicked-good vegetable soup.

01:34.944 --> 01:36.844
- Hey, give me a soup.
- Onion?

01:37.013 --> 01:40.278
No, vegetable. No one likes the onion.
And call Marty, would you?

01:40.450 --> 01:41.781
Marty, how come?

01:41.951 --> 01:44.818
There's some woman here
who might be in trouble.

01:44.988 --> 01:46.922
She might need some help.

01:55.198 --> 01:56.597
Here you go.

01:57.500 --> 01:58.797
Thank you.

02:13.650 --> 02:15.914
I used to love those crackers.

02:16.085 --> 02:18.076
When I was a kid,
my mom would get pissed...

02:18.254 --> 02:20.916
...because when we went out to eat,
I'd eat three packs...

02:21.090 --> 02:24.253
...before the food came,
and then I'd be stuffed.

02:25.695 --> 02:27.686
What happened there?

02:30.834 --> 02:33.496
Not that it's any of my business.

02:33.670 --> 02:38.164
- I'll leave you alone if you like.
- I'm trying to remember.

02:42.545 --> 02:45.070
- I was at Thurber's.
- Hey, Marty.

02:50.320 --> 02:52.015
I'll just have a soda.

03:00.063 --> 03:01.826
How you doing tonight?

03:03.867 --> 03:05.801
You live around here?

03:08.504 --> 03:10.904
I do. I live in the area.

03:11.708 --> 03:13.676
Haven't seen you around.

03:18.414 --> 03:21.577
No, no, no. I was born in Boston.

03:21.751 --> 03:22.945
Oh, yeah?

03:23.119 --> 03:24.984
You were born there?

03:26.723 --> 03:29.248
So where do you live now?

03:29.425 --> 03:31.086
Where's home?

03:32.128 --> 03:34.426
I don't remember.

03:34.731 --> 03:36.130
They...

03:37.233 --> 03:39.360
They did things.

03:40.904 --> 03:42.929
Who did things?

03:43.840 --> 03:45.307
I...

03:47.777 --> 03:50.644
I don't... I don't know. They...

03:54.617 --> 03:57.677
- They gave me a red medicine.
- Yeah?

03:57.854 --> 04:00.254
So, what was the red medicine?

04:00.423 --> 04:01.583
They didn't tell me.

04:02.392 --> 04:04.087
It's all right.

04:04.894 --> 04:08.330
And a blue one. There was blue.

04:12.435 --> 04:14.995
They confused me. They...

04:16.105 --> 04:18.232
...hurt me and...

04:19.175 --> 04:21.507
Ma'am, I think you should come with me.

04:21.678 --> 04:22.736
- No.
- I can help you.

04:22.912 --> 04:24.937
- No.
- No, no, no. You're not in any trouble.

04:25.114 --> 04:27.105
- Stop it!
- You need to talk to somebody.

04:27.283 --> 04:30.252
Stop it! Please. Please, stop.

04:33.089 --> 04:35.557
This is Officer Pitts. I've got a 5150.

04:35.725 --> 04:38.023
Can you make sure
that Hannah's available tonight, please?

04:38.194 --> 04:40.059
- Aah! Aah!
- Ben.

04:46.602 --> 04:50.038
I need an ambulance at the diner
right away! Now!

04:50.206 --> 04:51.537
What the hell is this?

04:53.443 --> 04:55.911
What the hell is...? Aah!

06:00.510 --> 06:03.001
- What?
- Oh, that doesn't bother you?

06:04.647 --> 06:06.114
Are you kidding?

06:06.282 --> 06:10.343
That man falls asleep counting pi
to the 101st digit. That's soothing.

06:10.520 --> 06:11.544
Walter.

06:12.922 --> 06:14.355
Was I humming? Heh.

06:14.524 --> 06:16.321
I thought it was in my head.

06:17.026 --> 06:18.288
It wasn't.

06:18.494 --> 06:22.430
Forgive me, Olivia.
Nothing sings like a kilovolt.

06:22.598 --> 06:23.929
Unique pitch.

06:24.100 --> 06:27.365
Nothing else in nature quite like it.

06:27.537 --> 06:28.561
I'm sure you're right.

06:29.906 --> 06:33.433
- What's up? What's on your mind?
- Short fuse today, I guess.

06:33.609 --> 06:36.305
Indeed. The tension
in your voice indicates...

06:36.479 --> 06:39.778
...that you're carrying
a heavy psychic burden. Tortured by the...

06:39.949 --> 06:43.544
Hey, Walter, I think she liked it
better when you were humming.

06:43.786 --> 06:46.220
The incident occurred
approximately six hours ago.

06:46.389 --> 06:47.788
All we've determined so far...

06:47.957 --> 06:50.790
...is that they were exposed
to high levels of radiation.

06:50.960 --> 06:55.397
Emily Kramer. Last night was the first time
anyone's seen her in two weeks...

06:55.565 --> 06:58.659
...since she was reported missing
by her parents. Police officer...

06:58.835 --> 07:02.202
...responded to a psych disturbance,
explaining the handcuffs.

07:02.371 --> 07:05.602
- They think she was a runaway?
- Her parents say no.

07:05.775 --> 07:07.436
They say she was perfectly happy.

07:07.610 --> 07:11.478
In fact, she'd just been accepted to a
master's program she was excited about.

07:11.781 --> 07:14.147
The level of radiation
coming from Emily's body...

07:14.317 --> 07:16.615
...is almost three times as great
as the rest.

07:16.786 --> 07:18.754
Are you saying that she was the source?

07:18.921 --> 07:20.513
Don't know.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.681
Dr. Bishop, any thoughts?

07:22.859 --> 07:24.486
Yes.

07:25.695 --> 07:28.357
Where can I get one of those white suits?

07:34.270 --> 07:35.703
Oh...

07:41.210 --> 07:42.973
Oh, yeah.

07:43.146 --> 07:45.341
- There's no head.
- She was sick.

07:45.515 --> 07:47.881
Most likely Bellini's Lymphocemia.

07:48.050 --> 07:51.542
Striped bruising on her neck
and upper arms, scratch in her torso.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.245
You know what he's talking about?

07:53.422 --> 07:56.653
Bellini's Lymphocemia.
It's an autoimmune disease. Irreversible.

07:56.826 --> 07:58.794
The body destroys
its muscles and organs.

07:59.128 --> 08:01.392
- Meaning, it's fatal?
- Yeah.

08:01.564 --> 08:04.431
But I've never seen Bellini's
cause a victim to lose her head.

08:04.600 --> 08:08.001
And what's more curious, this woman
seems to have been in remission.

08:08.171 --> 08:11.971
Cured, even. The rash appears
to be healing, the bruises receding.

08:12.141 --> 08:15.406
I'm gonna hate myself for asking this,
but how do you cure a disease...

08:15.578 --> 08:18.638
...that's incurable?
- I haven't the slightest idea.

08:18.814 --> 08:22.181
Though I, myself,
once cured this one in a dream.

08:22.351 --> 08:24.979
Opium. Fantastic stuff.

08:25.154 --> 08:27.918
Of course, I forgot how I did it
as soon as I woke up.

08:29.525 --> 08:34.655
- Aah! Thanks for the warning.
- One hundred twenty-one degrees.

08:34.830 --> 08:37.993
That's counter-indicative
for a hemorrhagic tumor.

08:38.167 --> 08:41.693
Most likely water molecules
excited all at once.

08:41.871 --> 08:43.600
He means the guy's brain was boiled.

08:43.773 --> 08:45.434
Like a Maine lobster.

08:45.608 --> 08:49.772
I need this body and the headless one
taken back to my lab.

08:49.946 --> 08:53.438
Walter, her disease... If there's no cure?

08:53.749 --> 08:55.410
That's a question.

08:55.585 --> 08:59.316
And one which we should pose
to whoever was treating her.

08:59.488 --> 09:02.889
Which makes three questions,
the other one being...

09:03.059 --> 09:04.959
...what exactly happened here?

09:05.127 --> 09:07.186
- That's only two questions.
- Oh, really?

09:07.363 --> 09:09.695
Oh, the third question. Um...

09:10.299 --> 09:14.030
Could I get some of this onion soup?
It looks delicious.

09:21.077 --> 09:22.806
Agent Dunham?

09:23.212 --> 09:24.804
Nadim Patel. Pleasure to meet you.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.575
Thank you for taking the trouble
to talk to me.

09:27.750 --> 09:30.310
Of course. I'm told you have news
about Emily Kramer.

09:30.486 --> 09:33.649
Unfortunately, I do.
Emily was found dead last night.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.552
What? How?

09:35.725 --> 09:38.023
I'm not at liberty
to discuss that with you.

09:40.062 --> 09:42.030
Forgive me, I'm just...

09:42.598 --> 09:45.829
Emotional investment in patients.
It's an occupational hazard.

09:46.002 --> 09:49.665
Her poor parents must be devastated
after everything they've been through.

09:49.839 --> 09:53.570
Yes, and I hate troubling you about this,
but we understand that Emily...

09:53.743 --> 09:58.009
...was suffering from a fatal disease
that had recently gone into remission.

09:58.180 --> 09:59.807
That's right.

10:01.851 --> 10:04.081
Do you have any idea
how that's possible?

10:04.320 --> 10:05.617
Medically, no.

10:05.788 --> 10:09.019
Were you treating her
with any sort of radiation therapy?

10:09.191 --> 10:12.592
Radiation? No. Why?

10:12.762 --> 10:17.825
The circumstances surrounding
Emily's death were unusual.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.528
It's possible that her condition
may have been a factor.

10:24.507 --> 10:28.238
- I'll get you her records, if that'll help.
- Yeah.

10:28.544 --> 10:31.104
She was finally starting to live again.

10:33.049 --> 10:36.280
Do I really need to be here?
Couldn't you just use a clamp?

10:36.452 --> 10:38.079
Of course I could...

10:38.254 --> 10:40.449
...but I enjoy the company.

10:40.823 --> 10:42.791
Quality time, as they say.

10:43.926 --> 10:45.985
This is like throwing around
the old pigskin.

10:46.162 --> 10:47.823
- What's that smell?
- Hyacinth.

10:47.997 --> 10:50.022
My third favorite flower.

10:50.199 --> 10:54.499
Associated in mythology with rebirth,
which in this case is cruelly ironic.

10:54.670 --> 10:56.501
- It's coming from her?
- Indeed.

10:56.672 --> 10:59.800
Which indicates either a mutation
at the genetic level...

10:59.975 --> 11:03.001
...or she was eating flowers,
perhaps her perfume.

11:03.179 --> 11:05.306
- How's it coming?
- Oh, Olivia, join us.

11:05.481 --> 11:07.676
We've learned some things already.

11:07.850 --> 11:09.249
We don't think she ran away.

11:09.552 --> 11:13.079
- Ligature marks.
- So she was being held against her will.

11:13.255 --> 11:15.917
That or she had a proclivity
for sexual bondage.

11:16.092 --> 11:18.890
Scientific observation, not a judgment.

11:19.061 --> 11:20.688
Some of my fondest memories...

11:20.863 --> 11:23.297
Oh! Walter, stop.
Wherever that's going, it's just wrong.

11:23.466 --> 11:27.698
There's also this.
Subcutaneous injection marks.

11:28.337 --> 11:30.601
She was
being given medicine intravenously.

11:30.773 --> 11:34.140
So whoever was holding her captive
was giving her drugs.

11:34.310 --> 11:36.904
Yes, but not the enjoyable kind. In fact...

11:37.079 --> 11:40.173
...quite unlike anything
I have ever seen before.

11:43.018 --> 11:44.576
You okay?

11:44.754 --> 11:46.779
Should I be?

11:47.223 --> 11:50.056
So how'd she end up in the diner?
Did she escape?

11:50.226 --> 11:51.591
Perhaps not.

11:51.761 --> 11:56.164
There are two distinct methods
of scientific experimentation...

11:56.332 --> 11:58.698
...lab trials or field trials.

11:58.868 --> 12:01.393
You're suggesting they may have
let her go on purpose?

12:01.570 --> 12:04.539
Whoever did this wanted to be sure
what they did was working.

12:04.707 --> 12:07.870
There was something inside her
that killed those people, in her...

12:08.043 --> 12:09.670
Noggin?

12:09.945 --> 12:13.073
I'm not sure yet.
It's a theory.

12:14.483 --> 12:17.714
Obviously, I'll be more certain
once we identify the substance...

12:17.887 --> 12:22.187
...or when whoever did this
tries to repeat their results.

12:22.358 --> 12:24.087
You mean, if they take another woman?

12:24.260 --> 12:27.252
Judging by Agent Dunham's
body language...

12:27.430 --> 12:29.830
...I'd say she's receiving that very news.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.432
Okay.

12:33.536 --> 12:36.767
Missing Persons called in
another case four hours ago.

12:36.939 --> 12:40.932
Claire Williams, diagnosed
with Bellini's Lymphocemia three years ago.

12:41.110 --> 12:43.578
Someone's targeting people
with the disease?

12:43.746 --> 12:46.909
That, or it's one hell of a coincidence.

12:51.387 --> 12:53.184
Hey, Liv...

12:54.089 --> 12:55.647
...I get it.

12:55.825 --> 12:57.588
You get what?

12:58.093 --> 13:00.994
Young woman, what was done to her...

13:01.163 --> 13:04.621
...you know, this coming your way,
today of all days.

13:07.903 --> 13:09.234
It's okay.

13:09.405 --> 13:11.134
I'm okay.

13:12.374 --> 13:13.739
Listen...

13:13.909 --> 13:16.503
...I know you don't like to celebrate...

13:17.046 --> 13:18.911
...but happy birthday.

13:21.150 --> 13:22.276
Ken Williams?

13:22.918 --> 13:25.751
Olivia Dunham, Charlie Francis, FBI.

13:25.921 --> 13:27.081
Claire. Did you find her?

13:27.256 --> 13:29.281
I'm afraid we don't have
new information...

13:29.458 --> 13:32.484
...but we do need to ask you
a few questions.

13:34.296 --> 13:36.457
Her name is Emily Kramer.

13:36.632 --> 13:39.226
She suffered from the same disease
as your wife.

13:39.401 --> 13:41.301
You seen her before?

13:41.804 --> 13:43.704
Another case?

13:43.873 --> 13:47.104
- What happened to her?
- Do you know her, Mr. Williams?

13:48.744 --> 13:51.577
No, I-I-I don't think so.

13:51.747 --> 13:53.647
We don't know anyone else with Bellini's.

13:53.816 --> 13:57.343
I mean, what we went through
fighting Claire's disease...

13:57.520 --> 13:59.351
...and the constant pain.

14:02.691 --> 14:05.489
When the lesions started appearing,
she stopped going out.

14:06.729 --> 14:09.823
The damn disease almost took everything
from us, even our marriage.

14:10.933 --> 14:12.594
Then...

14:12.968 --> 14:14.560
...it was like a miracle.

14:14.737 --> 14:17.205
- A miracle?
- She started getting better.

14:17.373 --> 14:19.534
The pain went away.

14:20.109 --> 14:23.374
- She went into remission?
- About six weeks ago.

14:23.546 --> 14:25.980
She was herself again.

14:26.148 --> 14:27.843
And now...

14:30.252 --> 14:32.243
Please find my wife.

14:32.421 --> 14:34.548
Please find her for me.

14:50.205 --> 14:51.536
Oh.

15:03.919 --> 15:05.045
What's happening?

15:08.424 --> 15:10.949
Please don't hurt me.

15:28.277 --> 15:31.337
The last one was a test. This one counts.

15:32.348 --> 15:33.679
She a candidate?

15:33.849 --> 15:35.009
Even better.

15:35.184 --> 15:36.742
Let's get started, then.

15:48.530 --> 15:52.899
To understand what happened
at the diner, we'll use Mr. Papaya.

15:57.139 --> 15:58.766
Clear.

16:01.644 --> 16:04.704
This is upsetting,
because he's the friendliest of fruits.

16:10.052 --> 16:12.748
And we have goo-ification.

16:13.422 --> 16:14.912
Is that the scientific term?

16:15.090 --> 16:16.455
Wait...

16:16.625 --> 16:19.093
...show's not over yet.

16:22.564 --> 16:25.260
This is what you think happened
to the people at the diner?

16:25.434 --> 16:28.892
That beam emits
high-energy microwaves...

16:29.071 --> 16:33.599
...which caused Mr. Papaya's molecules
to vibrate rapidly...

16:33.776 --> 16:36.370
...causing friction and producing heat.

16:36.545 --> 16:38.843
It's like how a microwave oven
cooks food...

16:39.014 --> 16:41.448
...only in Emily Kramer's case,
she was the oven.

16:41.617 --> 16:43.175
But then what killed Emily?

16:43.352 --> 16:47.118
This demonstration is far more effective
with living tissue.

16:47.289 --> 16:49.223
I have some expendable gerbils
in the back.

16:49.391 --> 16:50.790
- No.
- Oh, no. It's no trouble.

16:50.959 --> 16:54.087
- I'm sure you'd like it.
- Walter, just drop it.

16:54.263 --> 16:55.924
Wait, am I missing something?

16:56.098 --> 16:59.329
How is it that Emily is cooking people?

16:59.501 --> 17:03.528
In her blood, I found traces...

17:03.706 --> 17:07.540
...of radioactive isotopes, Strontium-90.

17:07.710 --> 17:11.839
I believe that these microscopic capsules
are designed...

17:12.013 --> 17:16.075
...to release just the right amount
of radiation at specific times...

17:16.251 --> 17:17.479
...to cure her disease.

17:17.653 --> 17:19.951
So you think these capsules
saved her life?

17:20.122 --> 17:23.717
- Think of it like time-release chemotherapy.
- Oh, yes. But in Emily's case...

17:23.892 --> 17:27.259
...the cure also made her
a perfect candidate for weaponization.

17:27.429 --> 17:29.556
Whatever was injected
into her bloodstream...

17:29.732 --> 17:33.293
...caused these capsules
to burst all at once...

17:33.469 --> 17:35.664
...sending out a microwave blast...

17:35.838 --> 17:41.504
...and, perhaps, given that her own head
was the source of energy, kaboom.

17:41.677 --> 17:44.578
So Emily's rheumatologist, Dr. Patel...

17:44.747 --> 17:47.215
...would he have access
to these sorts of isotopes?

17:47.382 --> 17:49.942
It's doubtful. They only use them
in a couple therapies.

17:50.119 --> 17:51.643
They're strictly regulated.

17:51.820 --> 17:54.311
Why? You think Patel
had something to do with this?

17:54.490 --> 17:55.514
I don't know...

17:55.691 --> 17:59.354
...but 83 percent of kidnap victims
are abducted by someone they know.

17:59.528 --> 18:02.361
I'm gonna go and talk
to Emily Kramer's parents.

18:02.531 --> 18:04.692
- I'll come with you.
- Oh, Peter.

18:04.967 --> 18:08.403
If you're going out could you
bring me back some cotton candy?

18:08.570 --> 18:11.539
- Cotton candy?
- Yeah. Blue, not pink.

18:11.940 --> 18:15.103
I've got a craving. Must be the hyacinths.

18:15.277 --> 18:17.177
Lovely blue flowers.

18:26.588 --> 18:29.079
You're probably way ahead of me
on this already.

18:29.258 --> 18:33.695
I'm noticing uncomfortable similarities
between this and other incidents lately.

18:33.962 --> 18:36.123
More humans being used as guinea pigs.

18:36.298 --> 18:38.391
My point is,
if this is part of the pattern...

18:38.567 --> 18:41.058
...what if these people
aren't just experiments?

18:41.236 --> 18:44.137
What if somebody
is preparing for something?

18:51.246 --> 18:53.612
Maybe we should come back later.

18:54.149 --> 18:57.710
Before or after they do to Claire Williams
what they did to Emily Kramer?

18:57.986 --> 19:01.217
Olivia, this is a wake.
These people are mourning their child.

19:19.074 --> 19:20.234
No.

19:20.609 --> 19:24.568
Don't you need a warrant for this?
Hey, Olivia, stop.

19:26.248 --> 19:30.048
Okay, crashing a wake is bad enough,
but rifling through a dead girl's things?

19:30.219 --> 19:33.950
It's the only hope we have of finding
a solid lead, so please, help me.

19:35.357 --> 19:36.949
What is it that we're looking for?

19:37.125 --> 19:39.423
Anything. Any connection
she may have had...

19:41.496 --> 19:43.327
What are you doing in here?
Who are you?

19:43.498 --> 19:45.363
What are you doing
in my daughter's room?

19:45.534 --> 19:49.095
Mrs. Kramer, we're terribly sorry
about your loss. We're with the FBI.

19:49.271 --> 19:51.262
FBI? Today, you come here today?

19:51.440 --> 19:54.637
Mrs. Kramer, please listen to me.
Another girl's life is at stake.

19:55.611 --> 19:58.011
- What other girl?
- Her name is Claire Williams.

19:58.180 --> 19:59.841
Claire?

20:00.883 --> 20:02.180
What's happened to Claire?

20:02.684 --> 20:04.379
You know her?

20:06.221 --> 20:07.688
A therapist...

20:08.323 --> 20:12.259
...told her to write through the pain
and the alienation...

20:12.427 --> 20:14.895
...and she felt it was all she had.

20:15.063 --> 20:17.054
Until the treatments.

20:17.232 --> 20:19.291
- The treatments?
- For her Bellini's.

20:19.468 --> 20:22.369
Emily and Claire both had the disease.
That's how they met.

20:22.905 --> 20:24.463
Here.

20:26.241 --> 20:28.903
They became such good friends.

20:43.392 --> 20:45.326
Why'd you lie to me, Mr. Williams?

20:47.829 --> 20:51.822
We met Emily at the hospital,
waiting for blood tests.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.695
She and Claire started talking...

20:53.869 --> 20:56.736
...sharing horror stories
about their disease.

20:56.905 --> 20:58.736
They became friends.

20:58.907 --> 21:01.341
One night over dinner,
the conversation turned out...

21:01.510 --> 21:04.035
...that medical establishment
had abandoned us.

21:04.212 --> 21:07.113
See, there's only 3000 people
in this country with Bellini's.

21:07.282 --> 21:09.750
Not enough for the drug
companies to make a profit.

21:10.252 --> 21:12.482
So they're not looking into
developing a cure.

21:12.654 --> 21:15.714
We've started talking to other people
who have the disease...

21:16.124 --> 21:18.991
...a microbiologist,
an investment banker...

21:19.161 --> 21:21.095
...a mother, a professional athlete.

21:21.263 --> 21:24.323
Started thinking about what
we could do if we pooled our resources.

21:24.499 --> 21:26.524
Claire and Emily
were treating themselves?

21:26.868 --> 21:28.995
We didn't have a choice.

21:29.171 --> 21:30.968
We were desperate.

21:31.139 --> 21:35.007
We tried radical therapies
normal doctors wouldn't touch.

21:36.078 --> 21:38.638
Three months ago, we found the cure.

21:38.814 --> 21:40.611
Time-release radioactive capsules.

21:42.184 --> 21:44.015
I don't understand. Why lie?

21:44.186 --> 21:46.814
Because the people we love
are depending on it.

21:46.989 --> 21:49.719
I couldn't take the chance
you'd stop that.

21:49.891 --> 21:52.086
Claire wouldn't want that.

21:52.260 --> 21:54.091
It's what gave us our lives back.

21:54.262 --> 21:58.221
Mr. Williams, we will need the names
of the other patients involved.

21:58.400 --> 22:01.096
I could give you some,
but I don't know all of them.

22:01.269 --> 22:02.998
You'll have to ask Dr. Nadim Patel.

22:04.106 --> 22:06.097
Emily's doctor?

22:06.475 --> 22:09.137
- He knew this was going on?
- He cared enough to help us.

22:09.544 --> 22:11.011
The medication...

22:11.179 --> 22:13.147
...do you have a sample?

22:24.760 --> 22:27.251
Is that my Bellini's medication?

22:29.965 --> 22:32.024
Tell me what you're doing.

22:32.968 --> 22:35.630
Please, just tell me
what you're doing to me.

22:36.004 --> 22:38.199
We know all about your disease, Claire.

22:38.373 --> 22:40.102
We know that this...

22:40.609 --> 22:42.702
...makes you better.

22:45.647 --> 22:47.080
But this...

22:50.085 --> 22:52.349
This will make you special.

22:58.260 --> 22:59.693
What is this?

22:59.861 --> 23:02.989
When I told you there were
unusual circumstances in Emily's death...

23:03.165 --> 23:05.998
...these were the circumstances.
- I don't understand.

23:06.168 --> 23:07.965
We know how it worked, Dr. Patel.

23:08.136 --> 23:09.899
Ken Williams told us everything.

23:10.072 --> 23:12.506
What we don't know
is who else was involved.

23:12.674 --> 23:15.541
I'm not responsible for this. Not this.

23:15.710 --> 23:18.838
- All I do is give them updates.
- Who's "they"?

23:19.014 --> 23:21.380
- Who's "they"?
- Intrepus.

23:21.650 --> 23:23.743
- The drug company?
- You should just walk away.

23:23.919 --> 23:27.787
- You have no idea who you're dealing with...
- I need a name, Dr. Patel.

23:38.934 --> 23:40.868
Dr. Patel?

23:44.706 --> 23:46.333
Dr. Patel?

23:46.508 --> 23:48.874
- Drop it.
- It was only supposed to be updates.

23:49.044 --> 23:51.672
Dr. Patel, put the gun on the ground now.

23:51.847 --> 23:53.212
Do you want a name?

23:53.648 --> 23:57.448
- David Esterbrook.
- No!

24:30.418 --> 24:31.783
Hey...

24:32.120 --> 24:33.985
...I found him.

24:36.992 --> 24:41.224
David Esterbrook, he heads up Intrepus
Pharmaceutical Research division.

24:41.396 --> 24:42.420
By all accounts...

24:42.597 --> 24:46.499
...he's solely responsible for a guns-blazing
Congressional lobbying campaign...

24:46.668 --> 24:50.536
...that allowed Intrepus to dig into some
of their more controversial R and D.

24:50.705 --> 24:52.502
Define "controversial."

24:53.108 --> 24:55.008
Prenatal gene therapy...

24:55.177 --> 24:57.236
...human-animal hybridization studies...

24:57.412 --> 24:59.004
...viral warfare.

24:59.181 --> 25:01.308
All the fun stuff.

25:02.450 --> 25:06.011
He's in Manhattan today. He's speaking
on the humanitarian-aid forum.

25:06.555 --> 25:08.352
Listen, Liv...

25:08.924 --> 25:10.892
...even if the doctor was right...

25:11.059 --> 25:14.085
...even if Esterbrook had something
to do with those women...

25:14.396 --> 25:16.956
...I'll go out on a limb
and say he's not gonna confess.

25:17.299 --> 25:19.324
I want to see it in his eyes, Charlie.

25:19.501 --> 25:20.991
I need to know it's him.

25:21.570 --> 25:23.470
Mr. Esterbrook...

25:23.638 --> 25:26.801
...sorry to interrupt.
Amanda Bennet, Baxil.

25:26.975 --> 25:29.466
Listen, at the risk
of sounding sycophantic...

25:30.579 --> 25:34.174
...I followed your work since Yale.
Three degrees including a Ph. D...

25:34.349 --> 25:37.011
...in medicinal neurobiology.

25:37.185 --> 25:41.019
I couldn't even get through Biochem
without cheating off my roommate.

25:44.359 --> 25:48.523
I'm sorry.
This must sound insanely naive to you.

25:48.697 --> 25:50.562
No, hardly.

25:50.732 --> 25:54.998
Science and technology
have reached a point where...

25:55.170 --> 25:58.196
...our means are finally catching up
with our imagination.

25:58.373 --> 26:02.332
And the only thing preventing us
from doing truly visionary work...

26:02.510 --> 26:04.569
...are these moral-based restrictions...

26:04.746 --> 26:09.513
...that lawmakers put up
in the name of public policy.

26:10.619 --> 26:12.086
That and money.

26:12.254 --> 26:14.814
We always need more money.

26:14.990 --> 26:17.982
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret, Amanda.

26:18.193 --> 26:20.388
It isn't about the money.

26:20.862 --> 26:23.422
It is about the resolve.

26:26.601 --> 26:28.796
I haven't been entirely honest with you.

26:29.404 --> 26:32.532
I don't work for Baxil,
but I do know a colleague of yours.

26:32.707 --> 26:34.197
Dr. Nadim Patel.

26:34.643 --> 26:37.806
- How is Nadim these days?
- These days? Dead.

26:39.381 --> 26:40.507
I'm sorry to hear that.

26:40.682 --> 26:43.549
Not as sorry as I was to watch it happen.

26:44.152 --> 26:47.087
Identity theft is a federal crime, Amanda.

26:47.255 --> 26:48.950
So is kidnapping and murder.

26:49.124 --> 26:51.524
- And it's Agent Dunham.
- What did you hope to get...

26:51.693 --> 26:54.321
...out of this conversation?
- I already got it.

26:56.031 --> 27:01.663
How old are you? Twenty-eight, 29?

27:01.836 --> 27:05.932
You're an attractive young woman. I'm
sure you want to start a family one day.

27:07.242 --> 27:11.042
It would be a shame
if anything got in your way.

27:28.830 --> 27:30.593
Broyles.

27:32.801 --> 27:33.825
When?

27:42.777 --> 27:43.801
Dunham.

27:46.114 --> 27:47.138
Hey.

27:47.315 --> 27:49.943
I understand you paid a little visit
to David Esterbrook.

27:50.118 --> 27:54.282
- News travels fast. I was just about to...
- In public, in a hotel bar.

27:55.023 --> 27:58.356
I didn't realize my interview techniques
were under such close scrutiny.

27:58.526 --> 28:00.687
Everything we do is under close scrutiny.

28:01.830 --> 28:06.995
This task force that you're now part of,
at best it's controversial.

28:07.369 --> 28:09.166
We need to be perfect.

28:09.337 --> 28:11.669
Trying to intimidate
such a high-profile suspect...

28:11.840 --> 28:15.207
...in a murder investigation is reckless.
- Claire Williams...

28:15.377 --> 28:19.575
...is a prisoner right now, having
God knows what injected into her body.

28:19.748 --> 28:23.309
And David Esterbrook knows where she is.

28:24.185 --> 28:28.019
He's guilty, and he just assumes
he'll get away with it.

28:28.189 --> 28:32.683
So excuse me, but right now,
I couldn't give a damn about politics.

28:32.861 --> 28:35.659
Which is exactly your problem,
and now mine.

28:35.830 --> 28:38.890
You think you're the only one
who wants to find Claire Williams?

28:39.067 --> 28:41.467
You violated the code and the law
of our profession.

28:41.636 --> 28:44.196
You let your feelings drive
your decision-making.

28:44.372 --> 28:48.240
You've endangered not only Claire,
but everything we're trying to do here.

28:48.410 --> 28:53.279
If I can't trust you to control your own
passion, Dunham, then I can't trust you.

28:53.448 --> 28:55.575
Is that clear?

28:56.418 --> 28:59.478
You'll have my report
on the Esterbrook interview within the hour.

28:59.654 --> 29:01.519
I'll be waiting.

29:05.393 --> 29:07.827
Is there anything else
you'd like me to run past you?

29:09.130 --> 29:13.260
Not anything, everything.

29:55.009 --> 29:56.408
How's it going?

29:56.578 --> 29:59.138
- She's almost ready.
- The capsules in her bloodstream...

29:59.314 --> 30:02.306
...they can be triggered remotely?
- Everything's as requested.

30:02.484 --> 30:05.078
She'll be stable
and ready for transport by morning.

30:06.120 --> 30:09.089
I'll call the client and schedule delivery.

30:09.724 --> 30:11.248
Well done.

30:35.950 --> 30:38.441
What's happening to me?

30:43.124 --> 30:46.321
- Hey. How's it going?
- It's great. Esterbrook's our only lead...

30:46.494 --> 30:49.622
...to where they're holding Claire Williams,
and I can't get to him.

30:49.797 --> 30:51.526
I mean, the guy's cleaner than snow.

30:51.699 --> 30:54.759
Not even as much as
an unpaid parking ticket.

30:55.303 --> 30:57.897
Well, I think we actually might be
making some progress.

30:58.072 --> 31:01.633
Walter thought he might have isolated
the compound in Emily Kramer's blood...

31:01.809 --> 31:04.744
...but he got distracted
by the unicorn running through the lab.

31:04.913 --> 31:06.346
Funny.

31:09.284 --> 31:12.481
Anything else? Any more jokes?

31:13.988 --> 31:17.685
Something's been bugging you all day.
Something other than Claire Williams.

31:17.859 --> 31:20.726
That's okay. Know what?
We're allowed to have our bad days.

31:20.895 --> 31:25.025
What's not fine, is blaming it on me.
I want to find her as much as you do.

31:25.199 --> 31:27.531
You're right. I'm sorry. I...

31:30.004 --> 31:31.403
I'm sorry.

31:37.312 --> 31:38.870
Fine.

31:39.213 --> 31:41.238
I had a stepfather.

31:42.684 --> 31:46.984
When he drank, he'd accuse my mom of
seeing other men, and then he'd hit her.

31:47.422 --> 31:49.754
And she just lived with it.

31:49.958 --> 31:53.450
She never called the police, not once.

31:53.628 --> 31:57.860
And then one day, he beat her really bad
and broke her nose. I was nine.

31:58.032 --> 32:00.694
He stormed out of the house,
got in his car, drove off.

32:00.868 --> 32:04.770
And my mom's crying, I can't help her.

32:05.640 --> 32:08.074
And then I hear his car.

32:08.509 --> 32:10.739
He's turned back around.

32:12.981 --> 32:16.246
He kept a gun in the drawer, near his bed.

32:17.285 --> 32:20.118
When he opened the door,
I pulled the trigger.

32:20.655 --> 32:22.714
And then I pulled it again.

32:25.159 --> 32:27.992
And I can still see his face...

32:29.063 --> 32:32.123
...almost daring me to finish.

32:34.402 --> 32:36.165
But I couldn't.

32:37.271 --> 32:42.004
So they took him to the hospital
and said that he couldn't be saved...

32:42.176 --> 32:43.871
...but he didn't die.

32:44.646 --> 32:46.011
He recovered.

32:46.180 --> 32:48.410
And then one night, he just slipped away.

32:48.583 --> 32:50.574
We never saw him again.

32:50.752 --> 32:54.415
I still blame myself, because I should
have done it. I should have killed him.

32:54.589 --> 32:58.582
I know, rationally, he's not responsible
for all the bad things in the world...

32:58.760 --> 33:01.820
...but he is responsible for some of them.

33:02.630 --> 33:05.030
And every year,
he sends me a card on my birthday...

33:05.199 --> 33:09.898
...just to let me know
that he's still out there.

33:12.807 --> 33:15.002
It's your birthday today.

33:23.785 --> 33:26.720
No man is untouchable, Olivia.

33:27.555 --> 33:31.753
You really want Esterbrook, all you have
to do is talk to your friend Nina Sharp.

33:32.093 --> 33:34.857
Massive Dynamic has
three separate pharmaceutical divisions.

33:35.029 --> 33:37.327
They're all in direct competition
with Intrepus.

33:37.498 --> 33:41.025
Their annual budget for corporate
espionage could feed a mid-sized nation.

33:41.202 --> 33:45.434
I guarantee you
she has something on David Esterbrook.

33:45.606 --> 33:48.040
- Even if you're right, I can't go to her.
- Why not?

33:48.209 --> 33:52.441
Because despite their annual budget,
corporate espionage is wildly illegal.

33:52.613 --> 33:55.377
You really think
that she'd admit that to me?

33:59.053 --> 34:01.647
It's here somewhere. I know it is.

34:02.056 --> 34:04.524
I just have to look harder.

34:14.268 --> 34:17.498
- I'm going out.
- Okay.

34:18.005 --> 34:21.873
Oh, Peter. To be honest,
I didn't even know you were here.

34:31.085 --> 34:32.848
Thank you.

34:34.388 --> 34:37.380
Excuse me. Ms. Sharp.

34:37.558 --> 34:40.891
- Hi, I'm Peter...
- Peter Bishop, Walter Bishop's son.

34:41.462 --> 34:43.726
You're not the only one
who's done your homework.

34:43.898 --> 34:46.389
What can I do for you, Mr. Bishop?

34:46.701 --> 34:49.261
Well, I was hoping
I could take a moment of your time.

34:50.404 --> 34:52.268
Does Ms. Dunham know you're here?

34:53.708 --> 34:56.108
No. No, she doesn't know I'm here.

34:56.277 --> 34:59.906
Well, Peter, suppose we take a walk.

35:00.815 --> 35:03.113
You're suggesting
that Intrepus is conducting...

35:03.284 --> 35:05.275
...illegal drug trials with human beings.

35:05.453 --> 35:09.651
That is a rather bold claim to make,
Mr. Bishop.

35:09.824 --> 35:12.759
How are you able to substantiate
your information?

35:12.927 --> 35:14.417
Would you put it past them?

35:18.065 --> 35:21.432
Let's assume for a second
that what I'm saying is true.

35:21.602 --> 35:24.469
Where would they do it?
They wouldn't risk using...

35:24.639 --> 35:28.598
...one of their own testing facilities.
It'd have to be some place off the grid.

35:28.843 --> 35:31.573
You still look the same
as you did when you were a child.

35:31.746 --> 35:35.273
I doubt you'll remember, but you and I
spent a good deal of time together.

35:35.449 --> 35:37.440
Some of it right here.

35:39.120 --> 35:43.921
Your father and I were quite close
when we were both much younger.

35:46.093 --> 35:49.256
Now, I have all kinds
of information, Peter.

35:49.430 --> 35:51.330
And some of it does me no good.

35:52.200 --> 35:56.102
Well, take the Aymara people,
for instance, of central Peru.

35:56.704 --> 35:58.934
I know that the soil beneath their land...

35:59.106 --> 36:01.666
...houses a naturally occurring
metal alloy...

36:01.843 --> 36:04.038
...that is potentially hyperconductive.

36:04.212 --> 36:08.808
I also know that you have managed
to successfully conduct business...

36:08.983 --> 36:12.146
...with these and other tribal concerns...

36:12.320 --> 36:15.812
...in parts of the world
traditionally resistant to development.

36:17.592 --> 36:20.425
I'm sorry, Ms. Sharp,
I think I must've missed your question.

36:20.595 --> 36:25.123
My question is,
are you willing to make a bargain?

36:25.666 --> 36:28.533
I give you the exact location you want,
and in exchange...

36:28.703 --> 36:32.764
...I get to come to you someday.
And you return the favor.

36:32.940 --> 36:34.874
No questions asked.

36:36.510 --> 36:38.410
Do we have a deal?

36:58.666 --> 37:00.793
- Do you smell that?
- Yes.

37:00.968 --> 37:02.833
And next time,
how about a little warning?

37:03.004 --> 37:04.028
Huh?

37:04.205 --> 37:05.229
Oh.

37:05.406 --> 37:08.398
Not that. Methyl eugenol.

37:08.576 --> 37:11.409
The chemical responsible
for giving hyacinths their aroma.

37:11.579 --> 37:12.705
Well, what about it?

37:12.880 --> 37:16.213
I've been trying to determine
what caused the radioactive capsules...

37:16.384 --> 37:19.251
...in Emily Kramer's bloodstream
to burst at once.

37:19.420 --> 37:23.880
- This is it, Asterisk.
- Astrid. Her name is Astrid.

37:24.058 --> 37:27.824
I've got it, Peter.
Methyl eugenol is the key.

37:28.296 --> 37:33.962
That's what they injected her with.
That's why these women were chosen.

37:34.135 --> 37:37.366
By itself, harmless.
But given their treatments...

37:37.538 --> 37:39.563
Causing all the capsules to burst at once.

37:39.740 --> 37:43.176
They made her radioactive.
They turned her into a weapon.

37:43.344 --> 37:48.976
It would be a decidedly blue compound.
And now that I...

37:50.885 --> 37:53.410
Yes. Yes. That's it.

37:53.587 --> 37:56.249
I've found the agent that will work.

37:56.424 --> 37:59.757
- That will interfere with the process.
- How long?

38:00.461 --> 38:04.227
- How long will it take to make the cure?
- Oh, not long at all, now that I know.

38:04.665 --> 38:05.689
Where's Olivia?

38:19.480 --> 38:21.345
When did this happen?

38:21.515 --> 38:23.540
When did this become
the world we live in?

38:23.718 --> 38:25.242
Patel. Esterbrook.

38:25.419 --> 38:27.819
These are the people we trust
to take care of us.

38:27.989 --> 38:30.981
5620 Stapleton Avenue.

38:31.525 --> 38:34.119
The facility where Claire Williams
is being held.

38:35.863 --> 38:37.387
How could you possibly even...?

38:37.565 --> 38:40.864
Radioactive isotopes have a heat
signature visible to spy satellites.

38:41.035 --> 38:43.503
Had a friend track it down,
National Recon Office.

38:43.671 --> 38:45.138
You have a friend at the NRO?

38:45.306 --> 38:47.831
I have a friend who's
cracked their control systems.

38:48.976 --> 38:53.436
Peter, if I pull the trigger on this,
and the information's bad...

38:53.614 --> 38:54.774
It's good.

38:55.483 --> 38:57.246
It's good.

39:03.157 --> 39:05.682
Charlie, I've got a solid lead.

39:06.761 --> 39:08.956
The strike team. Full tactical.

39:09.130 --> 39:10.722
- How we doing?
- Almost there.

39:10.898 --> 39:14.595
We're sure this is the one. We've got
a visible heat signature from the isotope.

39:14.769 --> 39:17.738
Visible heat signatures?
Radioactive isotopes don't give off...

39:17.905 --> 39:19.202
Walter. Walter.

39:20.107 --> 39:21.768
How we doing?

39:23.611 --> 39:26.671
Oh, um, Olivia.

39:27.048 --> 39:30.313
- This is the antidote.
- Okay, Charlie. We're coming now.

39:30.484 --> 39:34.079
Listen to me. You must inject this
directly into her bloodstream.

39:34.255 --> 39:37.281
- In the jugular, preferably.
- Okay.

39:37.458 --> 39:40.188
Facility's located
on the southern edge of Framingham.

39:40.561 --> 39:43.826
Surveillance teams reported
armed security on the premises.

39:43.998 --> 39:47.559
We're expecting resistance.
So this will be a tactical entry.

39:47.735 --> 39:50.727
Our main objective is securing
the victim - Claire Williams.

39:50.905 --> 39:54.602
Judging from the layout, it's likely
she's being held at the basement levels.

39:54.775 --> 39:56.436
We'll enter through
the northwest of the building.

39:56.610 --> 40:00.205
Alpha team will enter through the front
to clear out the west of the building.

40:00.381 --> 40:03.976
Bravo team will clear the lower levels.
Are we clear?

40:05.419 --> 40:06.886
Then let's make this happen.

40:08.289 --> 40:10.314
FBI! You're under arrest. Get down.

40:10.491 --> 40:13.153
- Stay where you are.
- Hands behind your head.

40:13.327 --> 40:14.555
Room's clear!

40:18.899 --> 40:20.560
Look out.

40:24.138 --> 40:26.038
We have man down.
We need immediate medevac.

40:26.207 --> 40:29.074
Call it in. Stay with him.

40:29.243 --> 40:32.872
- Level's secure. We got a few in custody.
- Any sign of Claire?

40:33.047 --> 40:34.776
- No.
- Okay, I'm going down.

40:34.949 --> 40:35.973
Watch yourself.

40:38.385 --> 40:39.511
FBI!

40:43.858 --> 40:45.450
Step away from that, please.

40:45.626 --> 40:48.925
Where is she? Where is Claire Williams?

40:52.833 --> 40:56.030
Dunham, you can't go in
that room. The radiation will kill us all.

40:56.203 --> 40:57.795
Claire?

40:58.939 --> 41:01.999
Claire, my name's Olivia Dunham.
I'm with the FBI.

41:07.114 --> 41:09.605
I know you're scared,
but I need you to listen to me.

41:09.783 --> 41:12.251
I need you to come to the door.
I can't come in.

41:12.419 --> 41:13.613
My head.

41:13.787 --> 41:16.221
Claire, listen to me. That's medicine.

41:16.390 --> 41:19.655
I need you to come to the door
and take it. I can't come in there.

41:22.196 --> 41:23.857
Claire.

41:25.666 --> 41:26.860
Claire. Look at me.

41:27.034 --> 41:29.059
That's good. Now come to the door.

41:29.904 --> 41:32.236
Keep coming.
I need you to take this syringe.

41:32.406 --> 41:34.840
I'm gonna tell you what to do.

41:36.343 --> 41:38.334
Good. Claire.

41:40.481 --> 41:43.644
Claire? Look at me, Claire.

41:43.817 --> 41:46.081
I'm right here with you. Claire?

41:46.554 --> 41:50.115
Claire, right now you need to
jab yourself in the side of your neck.

41:50.291 --> 41:53.590
Oh, my God, my head.

41:53.928 --> 41:56.453
Claire? Claire, come on.

41:56.897 --> 41:58.865
Claire, do it. You can do this.

41:59.833 --> 42:01.767
Do it. I know you can do this. Stab it in.

42:07.908 --> 42:09.068
Good, Claire.

42:33.300 --> 42:35.165
Agent Dunham.

42:35.536 --> 42:38.232
Apparently, I didn't
make my point clearly enough.

42:38.405 --> 42:41.806
I thought you'd be interested to know
that Claire Williams is safe.

42:41.976 --> 42:44.137
Can't say I'm familiar with that name.

42:44.311 --> 42:45.437
That's odd.

42:45.613 --> 42:48.411
Because an employee of yours,
Elizabeth Sarnoff...

42:48.582 --> 42:52.143
...just admitted that you supplied her
with the facility and the equipment...

42:52.319 --> 42:55.720
...to make Emily Kramer and Ms. Williams
into human weapons.

42:55.889 --> 42:59.950
A disgruntled former employee
will say just about anything...

43:00.127 --> 43:02.118
...to vilify the boss that fired her.

43:02.296 --> 43:04.821
Then you won't mind coming with me
to answer questions.

43:04.999 --> 43:09.026
Do you honestly see this
going anywhere, Agent Dunham?

43:09.203 --> 43:13.469
I have a law firm on retainer that charges
more by hour than you make in a year.

43:13.641 --> 43:17.042
Then I suggest you get them
to meet you at the FBI.

43:18.312 --> 43:22.373
I will include police harassment in the
litany of charges I will file against you.

43:22.549 --> 43:26.645
I'm still gonna walk you out that door
in handcuffs for resisting questioning.

43:26.820 --> 43:29.050
So the press that I tipped off...

43:29.490 --> 43:32.926
...can splash your picture
all over the news.

43:33.093 --> 43:37.462
Now, you may not answer to me
or the federal government...

43:37.631 --> 43:40.122
...but you do answer
to a board of directors.

43:41.468 --> 43:45.996
And I wonder what their response will be
when they have their company...

43:46.173 --> 43:49.939
...dragged into the middle
of a murder investigation.

43:50.344 --> 43:51.834
Oh!

44:32.886 --> 44:36.151
- I guess by now you've heard.
- That you frogmarched a senior officer...

44:36.323 --> 44:39.292
...of a multibillion-dollar conglomerate
out of his office?

44:39.626 --> 44:42.390
Yeah, I heard.

44:42.629 --> 44:44.119
Quite a few cameras there.

44:45.632 --> 44:47.532
The press.

44:47.935 --> 44:50.836
They always get their pound of flesh.

44:52.306 --> 44:56.072
I understand that you think
I acted too emotionally.

44:56.410 --> 44:59.538
Putting aside that men always say that
about women they work with...

44:59.713 --> 45:02.375
...I'll get straight to the point.
I am emotional.

45:02.549 --> 45:06.417
I do bring it into my work.
It's what motivates me.

45:06.954 --> 45:10.151
It helps me get into the head space
of our victims...

45:10.324 --> 45:12.588
...see what they've seen...

45:12.760 --> 45:16.491
...even if I don't want to,
even if it horrifies me.

45:16.997 --> 45:19.830
And I think it makes me a better agent.

45:21.702 --> 45:24.830
If you have a problem with that,
I'm sorry.

45:25.973 --> 45:28.134
You can fire me.

45:32.513 --> 45:34.447
But I hope you don't.

45:36.817 --> 45:40.150
You're not getting off that easy,
Agent Dunham.

45:41.688 --> 45:43.883
I'll see you in the morning.

45:50.497 --> 45:52.761
A spike in the price of oil again...

45:52.933 --> 45:54.764
...sent tremors
through the financial markets.

45:54.935 --> 45:58.268
But for pure shock value, nothing beat
today's very public detainment...

45:58.439 --> 46:01.670
...of Intrepus' David Esterbrook
by the FBI.

46:01.842 --> 46:05.243
Intrepus stock is being absolutely
pummeled in overnight trading...

46:05.412 --> 46:08.848
...and analysts predict
it'll open at $23 a share.

46:09.016 --> 46:10.381
That's a 10-year low...

46:10.551 --> 46:14.009
...which, of course, is very good news
for Intrepus' competitors...

46:14.188 --> 46:16.315
...most notably, Massive Dynamic.

46:16.490 --> 46:18.981
Shares of MD are up almost 12 percent...

46:19.159 --> 46:22.560
...as investors flee
to the most reliable brand in the sector.

46:25.032 --> 46:28.991
- Hey.
- Olivia, did you lock yourself out again?

46:29.169 --> 46:31.763
Actually, Walter, this is our hotel.

46:32.539 --> 46:33.563
Oh.

46:33.740 --> 46:38.177
- I need to talk to you.
- Sure. I'll see you upstairs, okay?

46:40.247 --> 46:42.010
It's nice to see you.

46:42.516 --> 46:43.778
Good night, Walter.

46:43.951 --> 46:48.217
And remember tonight, please,
the red toothbrush is mine.

46:51.058 --> 46:53.390
White for Walter.

46:53.560 --> 46:54.925
That's me.

46:55.095 --> 46:57.791
- Right?
- Yes.

47:01.068 --> 47:02.933
Everything okay?

47:11.478 --> 47:14.242
I know where you got your information...

47:14.581 --> 47:15.980
...about Claire Williams.

47:18.719 --> 47:20.516
What was the price?

47:20.687 --> 47:22.450
What did Nina Sharp want in return?

47:26.159 --> 47:28.627
Nothing untoward,
if that's what you're worried about.

47:28.795 --> 47:30.956
Come on,
you don't have to worry about me.

47:31.131 --> 47:34.259
I'm a big boy. I can take care of myself.

47:35.936 --> 47:39.337
You have been looking out for me,
so I'm just returning the favor.

47:44.278 --> 47:45.370
Thank you.

47:48.715 --> 47:51.149
There was no letter today, was there?

47:54.021 --> 47:55.511
No.

47:56.924 --> 47:59.017
Happy birthday.

48:09.069 --> 48:13.301
You better get back upstairs
before Walter falls asleep in your bed. Hmm.

48:15.175 --> 48:16.904
Yeah.

48:17.511 --> 48:19.479
He has actually done that before...

48:19.980 --> 48:21.379
...while I was sleeping.

48:21.548 --> 48:24.176
Really not something
you wanna wake up to.

48:27.955 --> 48:29.547
Good night.

48:31.892 --> 48:32.984
Good night.

48:49.910 --> 48:51.241
Mm.
