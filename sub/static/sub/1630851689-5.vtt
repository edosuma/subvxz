WEBVTT

00:26.693 --> 00:27.569
Uncuff me.

00:30.905 --> 00:31.781
What?

00:33.616 --> 00:35.994
You still can't beat me in a fair fight?

00:44.586 --> 00:46.921
You still have that look in your eyes.

00:49.424 --> 00:51.593
Like you fear nothing.

01:02.604 --> 01:03.980
This expression I like.

01:09.527 --> 01:11.237
Mango wasn't there.

01:11.321 --> 01:12.197
Captain.

01:13.406 --> 01:14.783
I can't reach Detective Jeon.

01:15.283 --> 01:17.035
He asked me to look up a location…

01:17.118 --> 01:17.994
And?

01:18.078 --> 01:20.371
And his phone turned off right after.

01:31.049 --> 01:31.925
<i>Did you get him?</i>

01:32.467 --> 01:33.760
It's been a while, Gangjae.

01:38.264 --> 01:39.891
Those morons.

01:42.060 --> 01:43.520
I knew you'd come here.

01:45.522 --> 01:50.235
<i>I didn't want to go empty-handed,
so I was preparing a gift for you.</i>

01:52.320 --> 01:53.363
Look here.

01:53.446 --> 01:57.075
OH HYEJIN

02:03.206 --> 02:04.833
Hurry up.

02:04.916 --> 02:06.334
There isn't much time.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.170
If you want to at least get her corpse.

02:15.093 --> 02:17.595
You thought you were something special,
didn't you?

02:18.596 --> 02:19.514
You are

02:20.682 --> 02:22.225
absolutely nothing.

02:23.059 --> 02:24.644
Let Detective Jeon go.

02:25.728 --> 02:27.689
He has nothing to do with this.

02:31.526 --> 02:32.527
You…

02:33.903 --> 02:38.366
just worry about
what I'm about to do to you.

02:39.742 --> 02:41.828
I'll play with you all night long.

02:53.089 --> 02:55.425
Damn it!

02:58.720 --> 03:00.930
I wanted to kill you
in front of Choi Mujin!

03:02.056 --> 03:04.392
Detective!

03:04.475 --> 03:06.102
Say your final words.

03:07.103 --> 03:08.187
I'll relay it for you.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.026
I'm going to kill you.

03:23.119 --> 03:23.953
Do it.

03:45.266 --> 03:47.352
This must hurt like hell.

03:48.853 --> 03:50.063
As you get crushed,

03:50.980 --> 03:52.398
your skull will crack open

03:53.358 --> 03:55.193
and your brain will ooze out.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.240
It'll be quite the sight,

04:00.990 --> 04:02.408
but I don't have the time.

04:05.119 --> 04:06.120
Bye-bye.

04:17.215 --> 04:18.341
Wake up, Pildo!

04:55.378 --> 04:56.587
Gangjae!

05:51.976 --> 05:52.852
Get out.

05:53.519 --> 05:54.645
Get out now!

07:02.046 --> 07:02.880
Hold on!

07:11.472 --> 07:12.557
Pildo!

07:21.357 --> 07:22.650
Pildo!

07:22.733 --> 07:23.568
OH HYEJIN

07:30.658 --> 07:31.534
Pildo!

07:32.785 --> 07:33.619
My god.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.163
-Pildo.
-Come on, Pildo.

07:35.246 --> 07:36.414
I'm good.

07:36.497 --> 07:37.540
Seriously.

07:38.708 --> 07:39.667
Geez.

07:41.752 --> 07:44.630
A detective getting handcuffed.

07:44.714 --> 07:45.548
Good going.

07:46.257 --> 07:48.217
You crazy bastard. Get up.

07:52.555 --> 07:54.599
Why does it feel nice being insulted?

07:56.559 --> 07:58.394
-You okay?
-Yes.

07:59.145 --> 08:00.146
I'm okay.

08:00.229 --> 08:01.564
-Hey!
-Hey!

08:41.938 --> 08:42.980
Are you all right, sir?

08:49.529 --> 08:50.947
Why did you go alone?

08:54.075 --> 08:55.952
Gangjae tried to kill Jiwoo.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.498
Just because of Jiwoo.

09:04.544 --> 09:05.962
You could have died.

09:13.261 --> 09:14.929
Jiwoo fired the shot on that ship.

09:19.141 --> 09:21.894
She did it at the risk
of exposing her identity.

09:26.107 --> 09:27.191
What did you do?

09:31.737 --> 09:32.697
Taeju.

09:34.824 --> 09:35.700
Taeju!

09:42.498 --> 09:43.916
Can I trust you?

09:51.299 --> 09:52.258
I'm sorry, sir.

10:05.229 --> 10:07.148
She's in surgery right now. Hold on.

10:08.899 --> 10:10.151
How long is the surgery?

10:10.901 --> 10:12.028
We don't know yet.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.363
We have to catch that asshole Gangjae.

10:15.656 --> 10:17.116
You go get treated first.

10:18.951 --> 10:21.287
We can catch punks
like Gangjae whenever we want.

10:21.370 --> 10:23.205
That asshole stabbed my partner!

10:23.289 --> 10:24.582
Jeon Pildo!

10:28.252 --> 10:30.004
I choose to trust Detective Oh.

12:00.845 --> 12:04.640
<i>All Narcotics members will carry firearms
until the situation is resolved.</i>

12:05.516 --> 12:06.767
-Hello.
-Hello.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.227
-Police.
-Yes.

12:08.310 --> 12:11.564
May I take a look
at the video from that camera?

12:11.647 --> 12:14.233
Have you seen this man?

12:15.025 --> 12:16.527
Girls. Come over here.

12:16.610 --> 12:17.862
You too.

12:18.863 --> 12:22.575
They're Do Gangjae and Kim Cheolho.
Take a good look.

12:41.719 --> 12:45.264
-Where's Gangjae?
-Shit, I don't know!

12:45.347 --> 12:49.351
Fucker! Do you want to die? Shit.

12:49.977 --> 12:52.104
-The result will be the same.
-Damn it.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.398
We can end it quickly or drag it out.

12:54.899 --> 12:55.941
It's your choice.

13:36.398 --> 13:37.816
Let's not waste our energy.

13:49.370 --> 13:50.454
What the hell, bastard!

13:50.538 --> 13:52.081
You are under arrest
for obstruction of justice

13:53.415 --> 13:56.252
-Stay still, assholes.
-Shit. You sons of bitches!

13:56.335 --> 13:58.128
You have the right to remain silent.

13:58.212 --> 14:00.881
You have the right to an attorney.
You have the right to remain silent.

14:00.965 --> 14:01.966
But don't do that.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.093
Because I'm pissed off.

14:43.799 --> 14:45.092
I'm sorry, sir. Gangjae…

14:59.231 --> 15:00.107
Did you eat?

15:01.942 --> 15:03.068
No, sir. Not yet.

15:03.736 --> 15:04.862
Want to get <i>samgyetang</i>?

15:06.655 --> 15:07.489
Sir?

15:08.365 --> 15:09.617
We used to go there often.

15:10.117 --> 15:11.076
Simakse.

15:11.827 --> 15:12.703
Yes, sir.

15:20.586 --> 15:21.545
Right.

15:22.379 --> 15:23.964
You used to like their daughter.

15:25.174 --> 15:26.133
No, sir.

15:26.800 --> 15:27.801
So it didn't work out.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.513
It really wasn't like that.

15:40.689 --> 15:41.857
I know you're trying.

15:49.073 --> 15:50.908
Let's see what Narcotics does.

15:53.327 --> 15:55.537
Gangjae will show up
if he's driven to a corner.

15:56.413 --> 15:57.289
Yes, sir.

16:11.553 --> 16:12.763
Dad.

16:15.975 --> 16:16.892
Dad!

16:28.821 --> 16:29.655
Dad.

16:30.280 --> 16:31.156
Dad?

16:31.824 --> 16:33.325
Dad, open the door.

17:05.774 --> 17:06.608
Dad.

17:07.985 --> 17:08.986
Dad!

17:09.695 --> 17:11.488
Dad! Don't go!

17:11.572 --> 17:13.657
Please show me your face!

17:15.492 --> 17:16.660
Dad!

17:18.996 --> 17:21.040
Dad! Don't go!

17:21.790 --> 17:22.958
Dad!

17:40.309 --> 17:41.185
Are you okay?

17:49.276 --> 17:50.986
You scowl even when you sleep.

17:55.365 --> 17:57.034
You won't last long like that.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.165
I lived for revenge like you too.

18:07.044 --> 18:08.378
I had a little sister.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.674
She went clubbing
to celebrate getting into college,

18:13.801 --> 18:15.302
and someone drugged her beer.

18:17.346 --> 18:18.597
She died on the spot.

18:22.059 --> 18:23.310
She had a weak heart.

18:27.564 --> 18:28.816
Did they catch him?

18:30.067 --> 18:30.943
No.

18:32.069 --> 18:33.445
I don't even know who it was.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.950
If we catch all the drug dealers
and drug ring members,

18:38.784 --> 18:40.160
he'll probably be among them.

18:45.541 --> 18:47.543
I don't know whom you want to catch,

18:49.503 --> 18:50.546
but I'll help you.

18:51.630 --> 18:52.714
Let's catch him together.

19:00.764 --> 19:03.142
Get dressed and come out.
I'll handle your discharge.

19:16.196 --> 19:17.656
Are you okay?

19:20.534 --> 19:21.410
Touch this.

19:23.370 --> 19:24.454
Touch it.

19:28.208 --> 19:29.251
Awesome, right?

19:32.087 --> 19:33.422
The swelling won't go down.

19:34.631 --> 19:37.926
They said a scooch over
and I would've died. Gosh.

19:38.969 --> 19:40.721
You have a lot of scars on your hand.

19:45.517 --> 19:46.894
Maybe because I was a coward.

19:51.523 --> 19:52.524
Not anymore.

19:53.400 --> 19:54.860
When I first joined Narcotics.

19:56.945 --> 19:58.322
Whenever someone had a knife,

19:59.323 --> 20:00.490
I used my hands.

20:30.437 --> 20:33.815
Detective Oh! Hey.

20:33.899 --> 20:36.068
Let's go inside. It's cold.

20:43.325 --> 20:46.203
When you get stabbed,
you need to fill the hole with meat.

20:46.787 --> 20:49.081
We're using our remaining
team outing budget here.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.834
Hold on, Detective Oh
should drink something warm.

20:52.918 --> 20:53.794
Here.

20:55.379 --> 20:56.380
What's that?

20:56.880 --> 20:58.548
I prepared chamomile tea.

20:58.632 --> 21:00.550
Oh, Geonpyeong.

21:02.219 --> 21:03.887
-Just grill the meat properly.
-Yes, sir.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.138
Detective Oh's hungry.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.474
Do you want it medium or well done?

21:07.975 --> 21:11.895
Daesoo is too unrefined and
can't eat this unless it's fully cooked.

21:11.979 --> 21:14.106
You punk. I eat beef tartare.

21:14.189 --> 21:15.148
You punk.

21:15.691 --> 21:17.985
Don't make her laugh. It still hurts.

21:18.068 --> 21:19.027
Sorry.

21:23.865 --> 21:26.159
I'm crazy happy you're back alive,

21:26.868 --> 21:27.703
Hyejin.

21:32.791 --> 21:33.709
Cheers.

21:40.173 --> 21:41.967
Is this really Korean beef?

21:42.050 --> 21:43.760
Grill the mushrooms too. There.

21:45.679 --> 21:46.972
Flip this.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.700
Hello, Mr. Choi. It's me.

22:07.659 --> 22:08.952
I've located Jiwoo.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.623
We need to send someone out.

22:16.710 --> 22:17.711
Who is she?

22:23.133 --> 22:24.176
A friend's daughter.

22:25.218 --> 22:27.429
Book a flight
and find her a place to live.

22:29.723 --> 22:31.099
A house on the beach.

22:34.186 --> 22:35.062
Yes, sir.

23:02.964 --> 23:05.342
CHOI MUJIN, CEO OF HOTEL LIBER
CHARGED FOR DRUGS AND ASSAULT, DONGCHEON

23:44.631 --> 23:46.049
Wrap things up and leave.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.094
<i>I'll make it so you can leave the country.</i>

23:50.220 --> 23:51.221
I can't do that.

23:52.973 --> 23:53.807
<i>Jiwoo.</i>

23:54.766 --> 23:56.268
I still need to check something.

23:56.351 --> 23:57.227
<i>Yoon Jiwoo!</i>

23:59.062 --> 23:59.980
Do as I say.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.191
You'll be in danger
if Gangjae is arrested.

24:06.027 --> 24:07.445
I'll take care of it.

24:29.467 --> 24:31.219
Captain. You wanted to see me?

24:35.724 --> 24:37.559
Find out every call this number made,

24:37.642 --> 24:40.520
received, and its location
for the next three weeks.

24:41.229 --> 24:42.230
Yes, sir.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.232
OH HYEJIN

24:45.358 --> 24:46.318
It's classified.

24:47.485 --> 24:48.361
Yes, sir.

24:59.372 --> 25:00.790
Gosh.

25:00.874 --> 25:02.209
Get going.

25:02.292 --> 25:03.335
Have a nice day.

25:04.127 --> 25:05.670
I'll walk on my own.

25:05.754 --> 25:08.256
-Sure.
-What? Hey.

25:09.007 --> 25:12.093
Why are you here already?
You should take a few more days off.

25:12.177 --> 25:13.553
I was getting stir crazy.

25:13.637 --> 25:15.347
We'll catch Do Gangjae soon.

25:20.018 --> 25:23.021
We got orders to carry firearms.
Go pick up your gun.

25:23.772 --> 25:25.023
-Okay.
-I got it, punk.

25:25.106 --> 25:26.441
Here. You forgot this.

25:26.524 --> 25:27.817
-Thanks.
-Sure.

25:29.819 --> 25:30.862
You came in.

25:32.072 --> 25:32.906
Are you okay?

25:33.531 --> 25:34.407
I'm fine.

25:35.700 --> 25:36.910
Captain Cha.

25:37.911 --> 25:39.204
Hey. Come in.

25:43.333 --> 25:45.835
<i>Jiwoo. Did you hear from your dad?</i>

25:49.756 --> 25:51.424
What did you say
to make him run right over?

25:55.553 --> 25:56.763
OH HYEJIN

25:58.765 --> 26:00.433
It's been so long.

26:03.770 --> 26:04.938
Do you know each other?

26:08.233 --> 26:09.234
Yes.

26:09.317 --> 26:12.070
I saw her a few times
when she was with Violent Crimes.

26:12.904 --> 26:14.364
She's a great worker.

26:17.367 --> 26:18.368
Come in.

26:34.342 --> 26:35.218
Detective Oh.

26:36.177 --> 26:37.053
We should

26:38.013 --> 26:39.180
grab dinner sometime.

27:01.286 --> 27:03.121
About Yoon Donghoon's daughter…

27:05.206 --> 27:06.666
Did you find anything?

27:09.794 --> 27:11.212
No, there's no trace of her.

27:12.255 --> 27:14.716
She completely disappeared
after what happened.

27:17.385 --> 27:18.428
Why do you ask?

27:22.223 --> 27:24.184
The missing gun
showed up at a crime scene.

27:28.438 --> 27:29.356
Donghoon's gun?

28:19.280 --> 28:21.241
Are you still looking
for your dad's killer?

28:22.409 --> 28:23.993
Why'd you pretend not to know me?

28:26.454 --> 28:27.372
Well…

28:31.042 --> 28:33.670
Something very amusing
seems to be going on.

28:39.175 --> 28:40.385
Want a tip?

28:42.053 --> 28:43.054
Five years ago,

28:43.930 --> 28:45.682
the one who buried your dad's case

28:46.266 --> 28:47.517
was Cha Giho.

28:49.936 --> 28:51.062
I heard a gun was found.

28:52.147 --> 28:53.565
Is Cha Giho the suspect?

28:56.609 --> 28:58.319
If you tell anyone who I am…

28:58.403 --> 29:00.321
What would I gain from exposing you?

29:00.905 --> 29:02.407
It'll just be a pain in the ass.

29:05.326 --> 29:06.244
Good luck.

29:29.684 --> 29:33.146
Serial number 20KG-0637.
Corporal Oh Hyejin.

29:35.815 --> 29:36.733
Confirmed.

29:41.571 --> 29:42.614
That's right.

29:42.697 --> 29:44.073
We'll put out an APB.

29:45.658 --> 29:46.493
Now?

29:48.661 --> 29:49.496
Okay.

29:50.455 --> 29:52.874
<i>The police are conducting
a manhunt for Do Gangjae</i>

29:52.957 --> 29:56.044
<i>and Kim Cheolho on suspicions
of murder and drug distribution.</i>

29:56.127 --> 29:59.881
<i>They've distributed
ten billion won's worth of LSD</i>

29:59.964 --> 30:01.925
<i>since November of last year.</i>

30:02.008 --> 30:04.052
<i>Moreover, they are under suspicion</i>

30:04.135 --> 30:07.555
<i>of murdering four members
of a competing organization.</i>

30:07.639 --> 30:10.266
<i>The police are asking
for assistance from the people</i>

30:10.350 --> 30:13.019
<i>to capture these dangerous criminals.</i>

30:15.522 --> 30:18.149
<i>The government has issued
a new policy on real estate…</i>

30:24.155 --> 30:25.198
Call and locate him.

30:26.616 --> 30:28.618
Gangjae doesn't know we have you.

30:33.748 --> 30:34.833
If you call,

30:35.458 --> 30:36.543
you're dead.

30:40.505 --> 30:41.756
The three of you, out.

30:42.674 --> 30:44.467
Didn't you hear him? Get up, assholes.

30:45.385 --> 30:47.220
Get up, you three!

30:48.096 --> 30:49.264
Now. Get out.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.183
Asshole. Call and you're dead.

30:52.267 --> 30:54.060
Hey, get out of here. Out!

30:55.144 --> 30:56.688
-Get out.
-You made the right call.

31:02.235 --> 31:03.152
Yoon Jiwoo.

31:05.238 --> 31:07.156
What are you doing with her?

31:09.826 --> 31:11.244
She wanted this.

31:15.832 --> 31:16.833
You see,

31:18.334 --> 31:20.503
I've caught many bad guys,

31:21.838 --> 31:23.840
but you're a real demon.

31:27.260 --> 31:29.512
A druggie like you wouldn't understand.

31:31.931 --> 31:33.600
It's called conviction.

31:36.269 --> 31:38.771
I don't know much
about shit like conviction.

31:39.314 --> 31:41.608
But my silence will cost more now.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.867
A few bags of drugs won't cut it.

31:52.702 --> 31:53.703
I'm sure.

32:00.209 --> 32:01.753
You never disappoint.

32:03.963 --> 32:08.051
Let's see. How thick is
Mr. Choi's envelope for me?

32:10.178 --> 32:11.387
You son of a bitch.

32:11.471 --> 32:12.305
Damn it!

32:12.972 --> 32:14.474
You prick. Hey!

32:15.433 --> 32:17.810
I'm a detective, you son of a bitch.

32:17.894 --> 32:18.978
Hey!

32:19.062 --> 32:21.022
You son of a bitch.

32:43.461 --> 32:44.796
I just got here.

32:47.090 --> 32:47.966
Good job.

32:48.049 --> 32:49.175
Why are you tipping him?

32:49.258 --> 32:50.760
I'm in a good mood.

33:01.270 --> 33:04.565
So? You let her through, you moron?

33:05.233 --> 33:06.067
Shit.

33:06.609 --> 33:07.443
Hang up.

33:11.280 --> 33:12.156
Chair.

33:12.782 --> 33:13.741
Now!

33:18.371 --> 33:19.288
What now?

33:19.998 --> 33:22.917
Why do you keep bugging me? Damn it.

33:23.001 --> 33:25.086
You sold me out to Gangjae, didn't you?

33:29.674 --> 33:30.675
I only did

33:31.592 --> 33:32.593
as I was told.

33:37.473 --> 33:38.349
This is a dilemma.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.605
How should I get rid of the bastard
who tried to kill me?

33:52.572 --> 33:55.491
I can be a cop and arrest you
for conspiracy to murder.

33:58.578 --> 34:03.291
Or I can leak it to Choi Mujin
that you're the one who attacked his gym.

34:03.374 --> 34:04.751
That wasn't me!

34:07.086 --> 34:08.421
I only got the drugs.

34:08.504 --> 34:09.630
I know.

34:12.967 --> 34:14.844
But would Choi Mujin believe you?

34:17.722 --> 34:18.556
Well…

34:19.140 --> 34:20.308
That's probably better.

34:22.977 --> 34:24.937
It'll be a pain to prove your crime.

34:25.688 --> 34:27.523
Wait… Shit.

34:35.323 --> 34:36.866
What do you want?

34:38.117 --> 34:38.951
Tell me.

34:57.345 --> 35:00.431
<i>Do Gangjae is fleeing the country by boat.</i>

35:40.221 --> 35:41.055
Yes?

35:41.973 --> 35:42.974
<i>Captain Cha Giho?</i>

35:47.311 --> 35:48.396
<i>This is Do Gangjae.</i>

35:55.903 --> 35:58.030
Why? Do you want to turn yourself in?

35:59.407 --> 36:01.868
<i>What? Like hell.</i>

36:04.162 --> 36:06.831
<i>I'm trying to help you out, Captain.</i>

36:13.713 --> 36:15.464
Don't you want to catch Choi Mujin?

36:20.761 --> 36:22.180
I'll let you catch him

36:24.348 --> 36:25.683
if you let me get out.

36:39.906 --> 36:41.574
Where did you get that intel?

36:42.825 --> 36:43.993
From Jiwoo.

36:45.661 --> 36:46.787
It may be a trap.

36:49.707 --> 36:50.958
You think too much.

36:54.003 --> 36:55.338
You suspect everything

36:56.339 --> 36:58.174
and look for the safest route.

37:00.343 --> 37:01.886
But now is the time to act.

37:04.889 --> 37:06.140
I trust Jiwoo.

37:11.729 --> 37:12.813
You stay here.

37:16.192 --> 37:17.443
If anything happens,

37:18.694 --> 37:20.780
someone must manage the organization.

37:39.215 --> 37:43.928
TO JIWOO, FROM DAD

38:50.161 --> 38:51.495
<i>The cars are coming in.</i>

38:56.959 --> 38:58.336
It's Choi Mujin.

39:02.673 --> 39:04.467
<i>Team Two, moving to position.</i>

39:17.313 --> 39:19.940
JEON PILDO

39:23.903 --> 39:26.197
DETECTIVE OH HYEJIN

39:37.249 --> 39:39.085
Those damn narcs.

40:01.023 --> 40:02.525
<i>Don't move. Stay in position.</i>

40:02.608 --> 40:03.943
Don't move. Stay in position.

40:09.907 --> 40:10.908
Gangjae.

40:12.993 --> 40:14.453
Come out and say hi.

40:23.295 --> 40:24.672
I'm glad you're here.

40:26.841 --> 40:28.551
I thought I wouldn't see you before I go.

40:58.080 --> 41:00.207
Captain. Do we move in?

41:03.335 --> 41:04.211
Captain!

41:32.114 --> 41:32.948
Captain!

41:34.825 --> 41:35.993
Come here, Gangjae!

41:38.704 --> 41:40.706
<i>Arrest them.</i>

41:44.752 --> 41:45.628
Freeze!

42:57.575 --> 42:59.243
Haven't been stabbed in a while?

43:02.288 --> 43:04.039
It's nice. Reminds me of the old days.

43:22.516 --> 43:24.184
Get over here, Gangjae.

44:34.880 --> 44:35.714
Fuck.

44:38.258 --> 44:40.260
I wanted to live a fucking cool life.

44:41.053 --> 44:42.721
You made a foolish choice.

44:46.058 --> 44:48.519
So did you.

45:16.213 --> 45:17.548
You let your guard down!

45:19.800 --> 45:21.385
I won't die alone!

45:28.934 --> 45:29.935
Don't move.

45:40.446 --> 45:41.447
Run.

45:42.614 --> 45:43.449
Now!

46:00.215 --> 46:01.884
You stupid bitch.

46:02.468 --> 46:04.845
You don't know anything.

46:06.013 --> 46:07.014
Drop the knife.

46:07.848 --> 46:08.974
Shoot.

46:10.184 --> 46:11.351
You said you'd kill me.

46:12.728 --> 46:13.937
So shoot.

46:15.981 --> 46:16.815
Shoot.

46:18.525 --> 46:20.277
Shoot!

46:22.279 --> 46:23.864
You can't, can you?

46:23.947 --> 46:25.908
Not anyone can fucking kill people.

46:26.492 --> 46:27.659
Detective Oh, drop the gun!

46:30.412 --> 46:31.663
What will he do

46:32.414 --> 46:35.417
if he finds out you're Choi Mujin's peon?

46:50.015 --> 46:50.849
Choi Mujin!

46:57.648 --> 46:59.149
I caught you in the act.

47:17.125 --> 47:18.126
Detective!

47:19.253 --> 47:22.464
I'll turn myself in.
I'll confess everything.

47:23.674 --> 47:25.133
Detective Oh, calm down.

47:28.345 --> 47:29.555
And…

47:30.389 --> 47:31.640
Yoon Ji--

47:59.835 --> 48:01.211
This isn't it…

48:07.926 --> 48:09.511
Fucking bitch.
