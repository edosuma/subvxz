WEBVTT

00:17.810 --> 00:19.478
ABENDSEN:
Meet Robert Street.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.273
A true believer
in the American dream--

00:22.314 --> 00:26.777
the quaint idea that a man
who puts in his time

00:26.819 --> 00:28.404
will eventually be rewarded

00:28.446 --> 00:31.782
with a better life
for his family.

00:31.824 --> 00:34.827
MAN (over P.A.):
Robert Street, section T4.

00:34.869 --> 00:38.539
Robert Street. Please report
to your supervisor.

00:38.581 --> 00:41.000
Maybe it's about that raise
I put in for.

00:43.294 --> 00:45.087
ABENDSEN:
But the America Robert Street

00:45.087 --> 00:48.048
has just stepped into
is very different

00:48.090 --> 00:50.217
from yours and mine.

00:53.345 --> 00:57.600
And this world offers
a man like him no guarantee.

01:02.021 --> 01:04.273
What's going on?

01:04.315 --> 01:07.276
I was told the new boss
wanted to see me.

01:07.318 --> 01:10.196
I am your new boss.

01:10.237 --> 01:13.866
But that can't be.
I-I don't understand how...

01:13.908 --> 01:16.035
I'm afraid I have
some bad news, Robert.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.037
We're going to have
to let you go.

01:18.078 --> 01:21.040
You... you can't fire me.

01:21.081 --> 01:24.168
Yes, I can.

01:26.378 --> 01:27.797
Oh, and one more thing.

01:27.838 --> 01:31.509
We'll need you to train
your replacement.

01:48.609 --> 01:52.196
ABENDSEN:
Robert Street has just learned
that the American dream

01:52.238 --> 01:55.950
is nothing more than
an Aryan man's nightmare.

01:55.991 --> 01:57.660
And for Robert Street,

01:57.701 --> 02:02.081
that nightmare
has only just begun.

02:02.122 --> 02:06.585
You may not know me, but you
might've seen one of my films,

02:06.627 --> 02:11.006
those terrifying visions
where the Allies won the war.

02:11.048 --> 02:14.385
My name is Hawthorne Abendsen,
and I am

02:14.426 --> 02:18.138
the Man in the High Castle.
Tonight, I want to share

02:18.180 --> 02:21.016
with you the story of
Robert Street, one of thousands

02:21.058 --> 02:24.645
from my vaults, another of my...

02:24.687 --> 02:26.188
TURNER:
Cut!

02:26.230 --> 02:28.691
-(bell ringing)
-Hawthorne, you're not
giving us what we need.

02:28.732 --> 02:29.900
We're gonna have to go again.

02:29.942 --> 02:32.945
Please, I've read
your hateful lines.

02:32.987 --> 02:35.698
I've discredited myself
for the whole world to see.

02:35.739 --> 02:36.949
What more do you want?

02:36.991 --> 02:39.368
I want you to make me feel
like you believe it.

02:39.410 --> 02:42.288
-But I don't believe it.
-Hawthorne,

02:42.329 --> 02:45.165
you want your hour
with your wife, right?

02:47.209 --> 02:49.128
-(softly): Yeah.
-Terrific.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.963
Let's try it again.

02:51.005 --> 02:52.590
-Uh, back to one. Lights.
-(bell ringing)

02:52.631 --> 02:53.799
Wait, whoa, whoa.

02:53.841 --> 02:56.594
At least let me
punch it up a bit.

02:56.635 --> 02:58.470
Ah, maybe on an alt take,
but for now,

02:58.512 --> 02:59.972
we do it as written, got it?

03:00.014 --> 03:03.559
-Got it.
-Great.

03:03.601 --> 03:07.146
Take four. Roll it!

MAN (over radio):
In Washington today,
the Warren Commission

04:17.091 --> 04:19.051
is expected to present
President Johnson

04:19.093 --> 04:21.095
with a summary
of their investigation

04:21.136 --> 04:23.597
into President Kennedy's
assassination,

04:23.639 --> 04:26.266
where 500 witnesses
have been called forth

04:26.308 --> 04:30.187
to give their testimony on
the events of November 22.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.686
(wind whistling)

05:59.651 --> 06:03.363
(dogs barking in distance)

06:46.740 --> 06:48.200
DURHAM:
Hold it right there, you two!

06:48.242 --> 06:51.120
(gunshots)

06:51.161 --> 06:52.830
Ah, show me your hands.

06:52.871 --> 06:55.499
Palms up.

06:55.541 --> 06:58.377
You know the drill. Papers.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.796
I don't have them.
I lost them.

07:19.481 --> 07:22.693
I thought at first
you were running the fence

07:22.734 --> 07:24.695
looking for a "date."

07:24.736 --> 07:27.447
Oh, yeah?
How do you know I wasn't?

07:29.449 --> 07:30.868
Then what're you doing out here?

07:30.909 --> 07:33.620
You know this is
a restricted zone.

07:33.662 --> 07:36.665
Just taking in the sights,
you know.

07:36.707 --> 07:38.667
Ha, ha.

07:43.255 --> 07:45.257
-MAN: Headquarters.
-Yeah, it's Durham.
I got a fence runner

07:45.299 --> 07:46.925
for pickup, no I.D.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.427
MAN:
Finally got something.
We hadn't heard from you

07:48.468 --> 07:50.762
in a while, thought maybe
you'd starved to death.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.264
Uh, yeah.

07:52.306 --> 07:54.933
-Yeah. (chuckles)
Wouldn't that be a trick.
-Yeah.

07:54.975 --> 07:58.187
Send strudel, right? (laughs)

08:02.149 --> 08:03.358
MAN:
What was that?

08:04.735 --> 08:05.944
Durham?

08:08.322 --> 08:10.324
Durham, is everything okay?

08:11.450 --> 08:13.452
Durham, what's going on?

08:15.162 --> 08:17.122
Durham?

08:23.670 --> 08:26.131
Durham?

08:26.173 --> 08:28.133
(siren wailing)

08:55.869 --> 08:57.246
We're not open yet, miss.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.581
-7:00 a.m.
-Uh...

08:59.623 --> 09:01.667
I'm-I'm happy to pay
for a loaf now if...

09:01.708 --> 09:03.919
if you'll allow me.

09:03.961 --> 09:06.296
(sighs) Sure.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.428
Thanks.

09:21.144 --> 09:24.106
Where did you get this?

09:24.147 --> 09:27.150
(sirens wailing in distance)

09:34.825 --> 09:36.034
(elevator bell dings)

09:38.620 --> 09:41.415
Obergruppenfuhrer Goertzmann
is here to see you, sir.

09:50.382 --> 09:53.343
-Heil Himmler.
-Heil Himmler.

09:55.012 --> 09:59.141
Reichsmarschall, what a pleasure
to meet you at last.

09:59.182 --> 10:01.143
Obergruppenfuhrer.

10:01.184 --> 10:04.521
Your reputation from the
Ural campaign precedes you.

10:04.563 --> 10:06.356
I was raised in the mountains,

10:06.398 --> 10:08.317
in Bavaria.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.944
I suppose you could say
I had an unfair advantage.

10:10.986 --> 10:12.988
Hmm.

10:15.699 --> 10:19.411
Ah, New York--

10:19.453 --> 10:21.955
such a marvelous city,

10:21.997 --> 10:24.833
-like no other in the world.
-Well, I think so,

10:24.875 --> 10:27.502
but then I was born here,
it's home to me.

10:27.544 --> 10:29.338
(thunder rumbling)

10:29.379 --> 10:33.342
Tell me, can you see where
the Fuhrer was shot from here?

10:34.885 --> 10:36.762
No.

10:38.889 --> 10:41.808
You've really turned things
around here.

10:41.850 --> 10:43.518
My wife Ingrid, she, um,

10:43.560 --> 10:47.522
she loves the shopping
and the views.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.358
She was sorry
not to make the trip.

10:49.399 --> 10:53.820
I had to promise her we'd return
for a longer stay.

10:53.862 --> 10:57.157
Sounds like you're thinking
of joining us.

10:57.199 --> 11:00.285
The Fuhrer has discussed
the possibility with me.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.912
What'd you tell him?

11:01.953 --> 11:04.456
I told the Fuhrer
that I'd think it over.

11:04.498 --> 11:08.502
The adventure of a new city,
but, as you say,

11:08.543 --> 11:10.337
there's nowhere like home.

11:10.379 --> 11:12.255
These are good problems to have.

11:12.297 --> 11:13.715
Sometimes.

11:13.757 --> 11:16.968
The Fuhrer can be, um...

11:17.010 --> 11:18.804
mercurial.

11:18.845 --> 11:22.516
It takes a long time
to enter the Fuhrer's favor,

11:22.557 --> 11:25.685
but no time at all to fall
out of it, as you yourself know.

11:28.730 --> 11:31.274
I've detained you
long enough, John.

11:31.316 --> 11:33.735
I look forward
to our dinner tonight.

12:17.362 --> 12:19.739
(knocking on door)

12:21.867 --> 12:23.535
A perfect morning
for a good rest

12:23.577 --> 12:25.370
and a pot of tea,
don't you think?

12:25.412 --> 12:27.747
It's raining hammers and nails.
(chuckles)

12:27.789 --> 12:29.791
Since midnight.

12:29.833 --> 12:32.544
Let's get you comfy
in the living room.

12:41.553 --> 12:44.097
Would you like something
from the library?

12:44.139 --> 12:45.932
-What's...?
-Oh.

12:45.974 --> 12:49.352
A gentleman guest of your
husband's left it behind.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.313
Everyone's supposed
to have read it.

12:51.354 --> 12:54.316
Well, then, I'll tackle it.

12:54.357 --> 12:57.194
Especially if everyone
is supposed to have read it.

12:57.235 --> 13:00.614
"Germania: A Triumph
of Aryan Architecture."

13:00.655 --> 13:03.450
Oh, architecture. That's boring.

13:03.492 --> 13:06.203
Architecture isn't just
about buildings, Bridget.

13:06.244 --> 13:07.829
BRIDGET:
Of course.

13:07.871 --> 13:09.831
I didn't mean to overstep.

13:09.873 --> 13:11.666
You didn't.

13:11.708 --> 13:13.710
And thank you.

13:17.589 --> 13:19.257
(whistles)

13:19.299 --> 13:21.551
-Hello, my darlings.
-Yeah.

13:21.593 --> 13:23.762
-That makes 18.
-(laughs)

13:23.803 --> 13:25.597
I told you it's all here.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.849
You want to check
the mortars and the .50 cal?

13:27.891 --> 13:30.185
No, I trust your count.

13:30.227 --> 13:32.020
All right.
Let's get out of here.

13:32.062 --> 13:34.022
All right, boys.

13:34.064 --> 13:37.192
Load it up. Come on, let's go.

13:37.234 --> 13:39.069
So is this a win

13:39.110 --> 13:41.196
-or a loss for you?
-(exhales) Too soon to tell.

13:41.238 --> 13:43.240
You know the JPS
is gonna come down on you.

13:43.281 --> 13:44.824
Like a ton of bricks.

13:44.866 --> 13:47.244
But we'll be ready.
What about you?

13:47.285 --> 13:48.787
Regroup, take a deep breath,

13:48.828 --> 13:52.666
then raise hell in the Reich
with our new toys.

13:52.707 --> 13:54.668
Good luck.

13:54.709 --> 13:56.545
You, too.

13:59.381 --> 14:02.425
CHILDAN:
Ah, goddamn it.

14:02.467 --> 14:05.262
WYATT:
What is going on with him?

14:05.303 --> 14:09.307
Says he can get a letter
to the Crown Princess.

14:09.349 --> 14:12.269
Claims there are some sensible
people at the palace

14:12.310 --> 14:14.688
who want the attacks to stop.

14:14.729 --> 14:16.731
Well, of course there are.

14:16.773 --> 14:20.151
You're kicking their arses.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.571
(laughs)

14:22.612 --> 14:24.614
(engine starts)

14:30.996 --> 14:35.250
Awfully hard to concentrate
with a gun pointed at my head.

14:36.501 --> 14:38.461
ELIJAH:
Hold up, what's it say?

14:38.503 --> 14:40.338
Can you read Japanese?

14:40.380 --> 14:42.340
Fuck you think?

14:42.382 --> 14:44.593
Uh... I-I'm sorry, I didn't know

14:44.634 --> 14:47.262
that Negroes were
taught to read Japanese.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.183
ELIJAH:
"Your Imperial Highness"?

14:52.225 --> 14:55.145
How the hell they gonna know
this is coming from you?

14:56.771 --> 14:59.065
-Uh...
-Easy.

14:59.107 --> 15:00.900
Easy. You're right.

15:00.942 --> 15:02.485
Okay? I think I can
do something about that.

15:02.527 --> 15:06.072
Just let me,
let me try to fix this.

15:14.706 --> 15:18.752
This is horrid writing paper.

15:18.793 --> 15:22.213
Send a messenger you can trust,
and have this delivered

15:22.255 --> 15:24.716
to Imperial Secretary
Hirano's office.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.762
I got it.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.480
Fellas.

15:46.613 --> 15:51.993
General Masuda and I were junior
lieutenants in Australia.

15:52.035 --> 15:54.871
One night, he force-marched
across a desert

15:54.913 --> 15:57.457
to protect my flank.

15:57.499 --> 15:59.876
Without orders.

15:59.918 --> 16:05.382
He was reprimanded, but I am
certain he saved my life.

16:05.423 --> 16:07.926
It is a terrible loss
for all of us.

16:07.967 --> 16:12.555
This terrorist attack
is the fault of the appeasers.

16:12.597 --> 16:14.099
We both know
who I'm talking about.

16:14.140 --> 16:17.686
Yes, General, I do.

16:17.727 --> 16:20.021
That is over now.

16:20.063 --> 16:23.066
You are free to do
what must be done.

16:29.406 --> 16:31.408
Kido.

16:33.910 --> 16:39.416
Is there a Kempeitai file
on Admiral Inokuchi?

16:39.457 --> 16:41.251
It would be unusual
to open files

16:41.292 --> 16:42.877
on senior Imperial commanders.

16:42.919 --> 16:44.295
I will not let the death

16:44.337 --> 16:46.881
of a man who saved my life
go unavenged.

16:46.923 --> 16:49.092
I understand my orders, General.

16:49.134 --> 16:52.303
I will have
Admiral Inokuchi surveilled,

16:52.345 --> 16:55.765
and I will start
an intelligence file.

16:55.807 --> 16:58.810
This must be kept
within our house.

16:58.852 --> 17:02.147
In your command is an officer
who appears trustworthy.

17:02.188 --> 17:03.982
Captain Iijima.

17:04.023 --> 17:06.025
Give him the task.

17:18.371 --> 17:21.791
CAMPBELL:
I had just engaged the target,
Juliana Crane, sir,

17:21.833 --> 17:23.668
when I was attacked.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.130
SMITH:
By whom?

17:28.840 --> 17:31.885
By you, sir. John Smith.

17:31.926 --> 17:35.555
The Alt-World's version
of John Smith.

17:38.808 --> 17:40.185
Go on.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.187
There was a struggle.

17:42.228 --> 17:46.816
You-- he was very strong, sir.

17:46.858 --> 17:49.652
And committed
to saving Juliana Crain.

17:49.694 --> 17:51.446
What happened, Campbell?

17:54.449 --> 17:56.075
He died, sir.

18:00.705 --> 18:02.707
You killed m...

18:04.959 --> 18:06.336
...me?

18:06.377 --> 18:09.798
Sir, yes, sir. I did.

18:11.299 --> 18:13.676
What happened to the body?

18:16.721 --> 18:19.474
I concealed the evidence
and disposed of your...

18:19.516 --> 18:23.353
the body,
so that it will never be found.

18:30.026 --> 18:32.028
Dismissed.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.545
Mrs. Smith?

18:48.586 --> 18:50.713
The Fuhrer's wife
is down in the lobby.

18:52.715 --> 18:54.676
Oh.

18:54.717 --> 18:56.928
Uh...

18:56.970 --> 18:59.138
Go.

18:59.180 --> 19:01.015
(elevator bell dings)

19:05.144 --> 19:06.938
The Reichsmarschall's wife?

19:06.980 --> 19:08.356
BRIDGET:
I'm afraid she is indisposed
at the moment.

19:08.398 --> 19:11.025
You are dismissed.

19:13.987 --> 19:16.781
HELEN:
Margarete.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.951
Ah, we, we weren't expecting you
until this evening.

19:19.993 --> 19:22.287
My husband's
dietary restrictions.

19:22.328 --> 19:25.123
Of course.

19:25.164 --> 19:28.710
W-Would you care for some tea?

19:28.751 --> 19:33.214
Stimulants cloud the mind,
and my day is full.

19:33.256 --> 19:36.551
I do not have the luxury
of lazing around until noon.

19:36.593 --> 19:42.181
I get up at 5:00 a.m.
every morning for exercise,

19:42.223 --> 19:44.809
after which I take
a cold plunge.

19:44.851 --> 19:48.021
Over breakfast,
I review my husband's schedule

19:48.062 --> 19:52.025
and edit his speeches and
by 9:00 a.m., I am in my office

19:52.066 --> 19:54.819
as Colonel of the Reich
Red Cross.

19:54.861 --> 19:58.239
And so I begin my day.

19:58.281 --> 20:00.658
How will you begin your day?

20:01.743 --> 20:04.746
I'm looking forward
to preparing our dinner.

20:04.787 --> 20:06.581
Hmm.

20:06.623 --> 20:10.543
Frankly, I am concerned
about you, Helen.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.923
You seem tired.

20:14.964 --> 20:17.592
And you've been away
an entire year.

20:17.634 --> 20:19.969
A sick relative?

20:20.011 --> 20:22.931
Yes. Uh, my brother, Hank.

20:22.972 --> 20:26.309
Ah. And your husband approves

20:26.351 --> 20:29.729
of your long absences?

20:29.771 --> 20:31.814
Well, he was with us

20:31.856 --> 20:35.068
when the demands
of the Reich would allow.

20:37.111 --> 20:41.115
Your behavior and absences have
not been what the Fuhrer expects

20:41.157 --> 20:43.117
from the Reichsmarschall's wife,

20:43.159 --> 20:48.498
especially in solch
wechselvollen Zeiten.

20:48.539 --> 20:50.500
I'm afraid
I'm not fluent enough...

20:50.541 --> 20:53.044
"Changing seasons."

20:53.086 --> 20:56.047
To which changes
are you referring?

20:56.089 --> 20:57.674
Oh.

20:57.715 --> 20:59.300
Maybe you have been away
too long

20:59.342 --> 21:02.053
tending to this sick relative?

21:02.095 --> 21:04.305
Well, he has
completely recovered.

21:04.347 --> 21:06.474
-Ah.
-No need for concern.

21:06.516 --> 21:09.394
-I am back now.
-Good.

21:09.435 --> 21:12.355
I am glad we had this talk.

21:12.397 --> 21:16.234
One's health is one's
most valuable possession.

21:16.275 --> 21:20.571
My miracle of my husband's
health is the talk of Berlin.

21:20.613 --> 21:23.199
(laughs)

21:23.241 --> 21:26.077
Seine Lebenskraft steigt.

21:27.704 --> 21:29.080
(sighs)

21:29.122 --> 21:30.123
Translate.

21:31.874 --> 21:33.668
"His sap still rises."

21:37.422 --> 21:40.800
Heil Himmler, Madam Smith.

21:40.842 --> 21:42.844
Heil Himmler.

21:55.773 --> 21:57.275
(elevator bell dings)

21:57.316 --> 22:00.111
Until the evening, Helen.

22:00.153 --> 22:02.155
Auf Wiedersehen.

22:39.150 --> 22:41.235
KAZU:
It's from Robert Childan.

22:41.277 --> 22:44.947
He says he's a hostage
of the BCR.

22:44.989 --> 22:47.075
We think it's genuine.

22:47.116 --> 22:49.786
They're offering
a temporary ceasefire

22:49.827 --> 22:52.955
in exchange for peace talks.

22:52.997 --> 22:56.250
I don't trust them.

22:56.292 --> 22:58.461
You don't have to.

22:58.503 --> 23:03.466
I've spoken with
the Crown Prince.

23:03.508 --> 23:07.553
The Emperor agrees.

23:07.595 --> 23:11.432
It's decided.

23:11.474 --> 23:14.018
Yes, of course, Your Highness.

23:15.853 --> 23:20.858
I serve at the will
of the Emperor.

23:22.401 --> 23:23.986
One more thing.

23:27.865 --> 23:32.078
If this meeting should be
discovered...

23:32.120 --> 23:37.333
I was acting on my own.

23:38.626 --> 23:43.631
Thank you, Admiral.

23:55.393 --> 23:57.937
(knocking on door)

24:08.447 --> 24:09.907
BRAD:
It's me.

24:15.830 --> 24:19.500
She says she's Juliana Crain.

24:22.086 --> 24:25.381
(chuckles)
Ah, the Reich is slipping.

24:25.423 --> 24:27.383
Trying to pass off
a contraband fiver

24:27.425 --> 24:30.261
as some kind of proof
of their mole's bona fides.

24:30.303 --> 24:32.680
JULIANA:
No, just trying to buy
a loaf of bread

24:32.722 --> 24:34.807
and a place to hide
from the police.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.602
Oh, would you look at that.

24:37.643 --> 24:41.981
It's dated 1964.
That's a-- that's a nice touch.

24:42.023 --> 24:43.900
You want to tell us
who you really are?

24:43.941 --> 24:46.652
My name is Juliana Crain.

24:46.694 --> 24:48.321
(quietly):
Okay.

24:48.362 --> 24:51.866
Juliana Crain was captured
in the Poconos a year ago.

24:51.908 --> 24:54.702
Yeah, that's right.

24:56.662 --> 24:57.830
Here I am.

24:57.872 --> 24:59.707
Hmm.

24:59.749 --> 25:02.376
It's just that nobody
walks out of a Reich cell.

25:02.418 --> 25:05.838
-Maybe I didn't walk.
-I think you talked,

25:05.880 --> 25:07.465
and I think you went over
to the other side

25:07.506 --> 25:09.342
to save your own neck.
That is, if you are

25:09.383 --> 25:11.135
who you say you are, and I'm,

25:11.177 --> 25:13.679
-I'm assuming you aren't.
-Hmm.

25:15.681 --> 25:18.267
Have you seen
the "Allies Win" film?

25:21.270 --> 25:23.064
Then you know exactly where
I've been for the past year,

25:23.105 --> 25:25.942
and I'm guessing
that you know Wyatt Price.

25:26.984 --> 25:29.904
Why don't you give him a call?

25:29.946 --> 25:31.781
He'll vouch for me.

25:39.038 --> 25:42.166
Let's say you are Juliana Crain.

25:42.208 --> 25:45.670
Why are you here, Juliana Crain?
Why did you come back?

25:45.711 --> 25:49.465
(scoffs softly)
To kill John Smith.

25:55.680 --> 25:58.057
-(clicks heels)
-Reichsmarschall.
My apologies, sir,

25:58.099 --> 26:00.101
but I think you should
take a look at this.

26:00.142 --> 26:03.104
A woman was taken into custody
early this morning

26:03.145 --> 26:06.065
at the National Mall
in Washington, D.C.

26:06.107 --> 26:10.319
We were able to lift a partial
print off a door handle.

26:10.361 --> 26:12.280
It matches those
of Juliana Crain.

26:14.323 --> 26:16.158
Where is she now?

26:16.200 --> 26:19.328
Unfortunately,
she escaped the guard, sir.

26:19.370 --> 26:22.748
Disappeared into
the District of Contamination.

26:25.876 --> 26:27.503
House-to-house,
building-to-building

26:27.545 --> 26:28.963
till she's found.

26:29.005 --> 26:31.090
-Sir.
-(clicks heels)

26:33.718 --> 26:35.928
-Metzger?
-Yes, sir?

26:35.970 --> 26:38.764
Increase the security
on my family.

26:40.224 --> 26:42.601
-Sir.
-(door opens)

26:50.568 --> 26:53.237
(doorbell rings)

26:55.781 --> 26:58.075
-IIJIMA: Chief Inspector.
-Come in, Captain.

27:01.412 --> 27:03.789
The surveillance you requested.

27:06.459 --> 27:08.794
Would you like a drink?

27:10.838 --> 27:14.342
My reporting
on Admiral Inokuchi.

27:14.383 --> 27:17.887
I can only surveil him
until he boards his ship.

27:17.928 --> 27:21.640
Shall I try to
gain a spy aboard?

27:21.682 --> 27:23.976
Yes, but this will be
sufficient for now.

27:25.353 --> 27:27.438
You have done good work.

27:28.814 --> 27:32.485
You are an officer
upon whom we depend.

27:35.529 --> 27:37.573
Thank you, sir.

27:40.409 --> 27:44.622
There is one matter I wanted
to discuss with you in private.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.499
Outside the office.

27:46.540 --> 27:49.085
Of course, sir.

27:49.126 --> 27:51.504
Per General Yamori's orders,

27:51.545 --> 27:55.424
the Tagomi murder case
is now closed.

27:55.466 --> 27:57.218
The assassin found,

27:57.259 --> 27:59.970
the weapon retrieved,

28:00.012 --> 28:01.639
conclusive evidence.

28:03.224 --> 28:06.143
And yet, something unfortunate
has come to light.

28:09.230 --> 28:12.817
We found a partial print
on the clip

28:12.858 --> 28:14.485
inside the pistol.

28:19.532 --> 28:22.201
It is yours.

28:29.708 --> 28:33.003
(laughs)

28:33.045 --> 28:35.673
Do not worry, Captain.

28:35.714 --> 28:38.092
I have spoken with
General Yamori.

28:38.134 --> 28:40.136
He has told me everything.

28:40.177 --> 28:44.432
I have redacted
the incriminating evidence.

28:44.473 --> 28:48.310
I only mention this
so that next time,

28:48.352 --> 28:53.065
you will be more careful
in covering your tracks.

28:54.817 --> 28:59.697
Thank you for the correction,
Chief Inspector.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.699
Next time...

29:01.740 --> 29:05.077
-I promise to be more vigilant.
-Good.

29:14.336 --> 29:17.631
(door opens, closes)

29:38.235 --> 29:40.863
-Refreshments, gentlemen?
-(Helen speaking quietly)

29:40.905 --> 29:44.408
-Beer? Cocktail?
-Surprise me.

29:44.450 --> 29:46.660
Thank you, Mrs. Himmler.

29:46.702 --> 29:50.915
Danke, Frau Oberst Himmler.

29:50.956 --> 29:52.917
Danke,
Frau Oberst Himmler.

29:55.503 --> 29:57.546
Handmade chocolates!

29:57.588 --> 29:59.089
From Café Demel in Wien,

29:59.131 --> 30:01.383
the finest in the world.

30:01.425 --> 30:05.638
Oh, danke,
Frau Oberst Himmler, danke!

30:05.679 --> 30:07.473
Oh.

30:07.515 --> 30:10.100
You remind me of my own
little Liebling

30:10.142 --> 30:11.560
at her age.

30:11.602 --> 30:14.104
Tell me, how many languages
can you speak?

30:14.146 --> 30:16.273
English.
And my teachers tell me

30:16.315 --> 30:18.442
-my German is the best
in the class.
-Ah.

30:18.484 --> 30:23.239
Had your Uncle Hank
recovered from his illness?

30:23.280 --> 30:24.323
Uncle Hank says...

30:24.365 --> 30:27.701
he has never been sick a day
in his life...

30:27.743 --> 30:30.162
because of fresh air
and fresh milk!

30:30.204 --> 30:33.958
Oh, these gifts.
You have been overly generous.

30:33.999 --> 30:35.459
Not at all, Helen.

30:35.501 --> 30:37.753
And I have one final gift.

30:37.795 --> 30:40.130
-For you.
-Ah.

30:43.300 --> 30:45.886
-(chuckles)
-From a French courtesan.

30:45.928 --> 30:48.806
From a long time ago.

30:48.847 --> 30:53.310
Hmm. That is lovely. Danke.

30:53.352 --> 30:56.855
Why don't I show you
the rest of the apartment?

30:58.524 --> 31:01.694
-The Japanese have one hell
of a problem on their hands.
-Hmm.

31:01.735 --> 31:05.739
Especially with this Negro
Hampton barking at their heels.

31:05.781 --> 31:09.285
Hmm. Tell me, Smith.

31:09.326 --> 31:11.245
How do they get out
of this mess?

31:11.287 --> 31:12.871
Oh, I don't think they do, sir.

31:12.913 --> 31:15.541
They're overextended
and they lack the resources.

31:15.583 --> 31:17.167
You're wrong, Smith.

31:17.209 --> 31:19.503
They lack the will!

31:19.545 --> 31:21.171
Goertzmann.

31:21.213 --> 31:25.092
Tell Smith how you handled
the uprising in Belgrade.

31:25.134 --> 31:29.430
Oh. We've created a false
resistance movement.

31:29.471 --> 31:31.890
Lured the real leaders
to a meeting and...

31:31.932 --> 31:34.560
(whispers):
executed them all.

31:34.602 --> 31:37.605
(laughs) That's...

31:37.646 --> 31:41.609
how you strangle an uprising
in its crib, Smith!

31:41.650 --> 31:43.193
(coughing)

31:44.612 --> 31:49.617
You need to sit down
and catch your breath. Come.

31:52.119 --> 31:55.664
(coughing continues)

31:59.543 --> 32:01.295
The Fuhrer's been rattling
everyone's cage lately.

32:01.337 --> 32:03.547
(coughing continues)

32:07.217 --> 32:08.427
Don't worry, John.

32:08.469 --> 32:10.554
You still have friends
in Berlin.

32:14.099 --> 32:16.060
But there are many
who disapprove

32:16.101 --> 32:17.770
of an American in charge here.

32:19.772 --> 32:22.441
There are also those in Berlin
who are concerned

32:22.483 --> 32:24.818
about ambitious young generals.

32:24.860 --> 32:27.905
These are problems
since the days of Caesar,

32:27.946 --> 32:29.573
aren't they?

32:29.615 --> 32:31.950
Will you excuse me?
I'm gonna check on the dinner.

32:44.546 --> 32:45.923
(quietly):
Margarete is laying traps.

32:45.964 --> 32:48.467
She's using the girls as bait.

32:48.509 --> 32:51.595
-(exhales)
-Mm-hmm.

32:51.637 --> 32:53.722
They are building a case
against us, John.

32:53.764 --> 32:56.558
-I can feel it.
-(Himmler coughing)

32:56.600 --> 32:59.812
Let's just get through
the evening.

32:59.853 --> 33:01.814
Okay.

33:07.403 --> 33:10.239
SMITH:
Mein Fuhrer, if you'd like to
sit at the head

33:10.280 --> 33:12.491
-of the table, please.
-Ah, wherever I sit

33:12.533 --> 33:14.201
is the head of the table.

33:14.243 --> 33:16.328
But...

33:16.370 --> 33:19.039
I want the little ones,
the beautiful future

33:19.081 --> 33:21.875
of the master race,
to sit here beside me.

33:21.917 --> 33:25.003
HELEN:
Go ahead, have a seat, girls.

33:30.884 --> 33:32.678
Wilhelm?

33:33.721 --> 33:35.848
Please.

33:38.100 --> 33:39.643
(Himmler sighs)

33:39.685 --> 33:41.770
(silverware clinking)

33:47.067 --> 33:49.319
The film about your son's life,

33:49.361 --> 33:51.155
his commitment to the Reich,

33:51.196 --> 33:54.283
everyone in Berlin
has seen it, it's...

33:54.324 --> 33:57.411
-so deeply moving.
-Hmm.

33:57.453 --> 33:59.997
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

34:00.038 --> 34:02.875
(slurps, coughs)

34:02.916 --> 34:06.170
(coughing continues)

34:08.172 --> 34:10.132
-Girls.
-Nein.

34:10.174 --> 34:12.384
This damned mask.

34:17.806 --> 34:19.767
(panting)

34:22.102 --> 34:23.979
So, Smith.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.399
Why is Die Nebenwelt
behind schedule?

34:29.526 --> 34:32.362
Die, uh, Nebenwelt?

34:32.404 --> 34:34.490
Oh, it's, uh, a new device for

34:34.531 --> 34:36.283
measuring scientific
intelligence.

34:36.325 --> 34:38.118
I don't want intelligence.

34:38.160 --> 34:39.703
I want Lebensraum.

34:39.745 --> 34:41.872
Room to live.

34:41.914 --> 34:43.791
Germ warfare, wipe them out

34:43.832 --> 34:45.542
(wheezing):
if you have to...

34:45.584 --> 34:48.128
(coughing)

34:48.170 --> 34:50.756
Nein! Genug.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.176
Perhaps we should
talk about this in private

34:54.218 --> 34:56.386
when the girls
have been excused.

34:56.428 --> 34:58.680
-(coughing)
-HELEN: Maybe the girls

34:58.722 --> 35:00.933
should be excused. Girls?

35:00.974 --> 35:02.810
Bridget will send plates
to your rooms.

35:02.851 --> 35:04.311
Oh, come now, Mutti.

35:04.353 --> 35:06.563
Let them stay.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.398
It's not every night

35:08.440 --> 35:11.109
that the Fuhrer comes to visit.

35:13.111 --> 35:16.073
I believe I really must
insist, Mein Fuhrer.

35:16.114 --> 35:19.243
They have homework to do
and it is late already.

35:21.161 --> 35:23.288
Gute Nacht, Madels.

35:23.330 --> 35:25.541
Gute Nacht, Mein Fuhrer.

35:25.582 --> 35:27.459
Good night, Mein Fuhrer.

35:27.501 --> 35:29.503
Night-night, girls.

35:37.803 --> 35:39.555
Margarete.

35:39.596 --> 35:41.348
Danke.

35:41.390 --> 35:42.933
There you are.

35:42.975 --> 35:45.310
I look forward
to seeing you soon, Helen.

35:45.352 --> 35:47.896
It was so wonderful
to host you twice in one day.

35:47.938 --> 35:49.898
(chuckles softly)

35:49.940 --> 35:51.400
Wilhelm.

35:51.441 --> 35:53.193
-Thank you again, Helen.
-Mm-hmm.

35:53.235 --> 35:55.237
And, um, your daughters
are beautiful.

35:55.279 --> 35:56.864
-Oh.
-Favoring their mother.

35:56.905 --> 35:59.700
Thank you.

35:59.741 --> 36:01.618
John, thank you
for this evening.

36:01.660 --> 36:04.329
Let's get that drink
next time you're in town.

36:04.371 --> 36:06.373
Safe travels.

36:09.668 --> 36:12.254
All I see in Berlin
are smiling faces,

36:12.296 --> 36:14.089
everywhere I look.

36:14.131 --> 36:16.466
But there's no one I can trust.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.260
You'll always have my loyalty.

36:18.302 --> 36:19.678
(chuckles)

36:19.720 --> 36:21.805
I don't want your loyalty, John.

36:23.807 --> 36:26.435
I want your devotion.

36:34.568 --> 36:36.320
I've never seen him
this bad before.

36:36.361 --> 36:38.906
He's... one coughing fit away

36:38.947 --> 36:41.491
from having
you eliminated, John.

36:43.201 --> 36:44.995
All of us.

36:46.997 --> 36:48.373
I know.

37:21.323 --> 37:24.201
Watch your step.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.036
My, uh, husband and I...

37:26.078 --> 37:28.205
started building this
as a bomb shelter

37:28.246 --> 37:30.248
toward the end of the war.

37:34.336 --> 37:36.546
We didn't finish it in time.

37:40.842 --> 37:43.428
JULIANA:
Well, they dropped the bomb
on a Sunday, didn't they?

37:43.470 --> 37:46.014
Knowing so many
would be in church.

37:53.230 --> 37:55.399
After the war,
they took my husband.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.859
For his "impurity."

37:59.861 --> 38:01.863
I was happy to offer this
to the Resistance

38:01.905 --> 38:03.657
as a hiding place.

38:07.828 --> 38:09.621
Uh...

38:09.663 --> 38:12.165
I have to lock you in,
for the time being.

38:12.207 --> 38:13.750
No, I understand.

38:13.792 --> 38:16.670
Well, please, won't you sit?

38:16.712 --> 38:19.798
I'll, uh, I'll bring you
some food in a bit.

38:24.469 --> 38:28.390
I believe that you are
who you say you are.

38:32.352 --> 38:33.770
Can I...

38:35.814 --> 38:37.607
...can I ask you something?

38:37.649 --> 38:39.943
Of course.

38:39.985 --> 38:42.320
I've seen the film.

38:42.362 --> 38:44.531
A lot of us have.

38:44.573 --> 38:49.745
There's Roosevelt alive
with Churchill and Stalin.

38:49.786 --> 38:53.665
I remember the day Roosevelt
was assassinated.

38:53.707 --> 38:56.001
Yeah.

38:56.043 --> 38:58.628
But in that world, he survived.

39:00.547 --> 39:02.966
Please, could you keep going?

39:03.008 --> 39:04.926
W-What happened next?

39:04.968 --> 39:07.429
I have something I...
could show you.

39:07.471 --> 39:09.097
Okay.

39:14.770 --> 39:16.980
-This is, uh...
-(sniffles)

39:19.024 --> 39:20.484
This is a sketch

39:20.525 --> 39:22.360
that I did from
a newspaper clipping

39:22.402 --> 39:24.196
after FDR was shot at.

39:24.237 --> 39:25.781
One bullet could have
changed everything.

39:25.822 --> 39:27.240
But it didn't.

39:28.992 --> 39:30.577
Not there.

39:30.619 --> 39:32.746
W-What's this one?

39:32.788 --> 39:35.582
That's Roosevelt. That's after
he created the New Deal.

39:35.624 --> 39:37.334
-New Deal?
-Yeah.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.920
Just, um,
"Relief, Reform, Recovery."

39:39.961 --> 39:41.546
That was the motto,

39:41.588 --> 39:43.965
and he completely rebuilt
the economy.

39:44.007 --> 39:46.968
-Ended the Depression?
-He did.

39:47.010 --> 39:50.097
He also led the U.S.
to victory over Nazi Germany.

39:55.310 --> 39:57.312
(keys jangle)

39:59.773 --> 40:01.900
-Baby. Oh, baby.
-Oh, God.

40:01.942 --> 40:04.277
-Oh.
-Oh, baby.

40:04.319 --> 40:06.363
Let me see your face.
Let me see it.

40:06.404 --> 40:08.156
-There it is.
-(sighs)

40:08.198 --> 40:09.574
(chuckling):
Oh...

40:09.616 --> 40:12.911
-Hey, Pale Face.
-(laughs)

40:12.953 --> 40:14.371
(both chuckle)

40:14.412 --> 40:15.997
They let you have any sun today?

40:16.039 --> 40:17.833
It was raining.

40:17.874 --> 40:19.501
They brought me some cold tea.

40:19.543 --> 40:21.419
-(sighs)
-(sniffles)

40:21.461 --> 40:23.964
I don't know what else to do
to make 'em treat you better.

40:24.005 --> 40:26.508
No, I don't want you
to do anything more.

40:26.550 --> 40:28.343
In fact...

40:30.345 --> 40:32.347
I want you to stop doing
what you're doing

40:32.389 --> 40:34.141
-altogether.
-Babe...

40:34.182 --> 40:37.060
if I don't collaborate,
they'll separate us or worse.

40:37.102 --> 40:40.147
You are discrediting
all the work we've done.

40:40.188 --> 40:42.357
And it's worth it
just to see you.

40:42.399 --> 40:44.609
Can't you see it's killing you?

40:44.651 --> 40:46.486
What--

40:46.528 --> 40:48.989
Okay, what if I stop?
What if I stop?

40:49.030 --> 40:52.742
No, I will never, ever,
ever give them a reason

40:52.784 --> 40:54.828
-or cause to harm you.
-I know that.

40:54.870 --> 40:58.748
But... we're dying in front
of each other's eyes.

41:00.750 --> 41:02.502
-Well, they'll kill us
anyway, hon.
-(sobbing)

41:02.544 --> 41:05.505
-And they're not now?
-(knocking on door)

41:05.547 --> 41:07.340
Go away, I've earned my time.

41:07.382 --> 41:08.842
(door opens)

41:08.884 --> 41:11.761
No. No!

41:11.803 --> 41:13.513
-Don't! No! No!
-What are you doing?

41:13.555 --> 41:15.932
-You leave me alone!
What are you doing?!
-Stop it! Stop it!

41:15.974 --> 41:18.602
-What are you doing?!
-N-No, I'm not going!

41:18.643 --> 41:21.062
-Caroline!
-(sobbing): Oh, God! No...

41:21.104 --> 41:23.023
Caroline!

41:23.064 --> 41:25.609
Damn it! Damn it!

41:28.195 --> 41:30.197
(Abendsen shouting indistinctly
in distance)

41:32.365 --> 41:34.326
No!

41:34.367 --> 41:36.786
(grunts)

41:36.828 --> 41:40.665
I was promised
time with my wife!

41:40.707 --> 41:44.377
You can go back soon.
I just, uh,

41:44.419 --> 41:46.379
have a couple
of questions for you.

41:46.421 --> 41:50.008
(chuckles)
I'm a captive audience.

41:52.052 --> 41:54.471
There's a...

41:54.512 --> 41:57.015
a theory--

41:57.057 --> 41:59.517
the presence of an observer

41:59.559 --> 42:03.647
in an experiment
alters the outcome

42:03.688 --> 42:06.399
of the experiment itself.

42:06.441 --> 42:08.652
Sounds like you've been reading
your Heisenberg.

42:08.693 --> 42:11.404
-Is it true?
-Yeah.

42:11.446 --> 42:13.406
That's his theory at least.

42:13.448 --> 42:19.162
Have you read about "action at a
distance" in quantum mechanics?

42:19.204 --> 42:20.372
Go on.

42:20.413 --> 42:21.790
What happens in one universe

42:21.831 --> 42:24.417
immediately changes
another universe,

42:24.459 --> 42:27.212
across time and space.

42:27.254 --> 42:29.506
Einstein himself called it...

42:29.547 --> 42:32.008
"spooky."

42:32.050 --> 42:36.429
So it's not just the person
that changes, it's the...

42:36.471 --> 42:38.848
it's the world he came from.

42:38.890 --> 42:40.684
Well, it has to, John.

42:40.725 --> 42:44.187
How can anyone who travels
the road not taken

42:44.229 --> 42:46.773
not be changed?

42:46.815 --> 42:49.192
Why are you asking?

42:52.362 --> 42:54.114
(quietly):
What...

42:56.116 --> 42:58.118
What have you done?

43:01.830 --> 43:05.583
Well... be careful
out there, John.

43:05.625 --> 43:08.420
You might find out
who you really are.

43:08.461 --> 43:09.629
"Happy trails

43:09.671 --> 43:13.717
"to you until we meet again.

43:13.758 --> 43:18.555
"Happy trails to you!

43:18.596 --> 43:21.558
(fading):
Keep smiling..."

43:21.599 --> 43:23.601
Your wallet with currency.

43:27.105 --> 43:29.107
Your watch.

43:31.651 --> 43:35.030
And your wedding ring
I recovered

43:35.071 --> 43:37.615
from the-the body.

43:42.787 --> 43:46.958
General Whitcroft's been briefed
that I'm on a covert mission.

43:47.000 --> 43:50.420
He doesn't know where
or what purpose.

43:50.462 --> 43:52.464
Yes, Reichsmarschall.

43:54.549 --> 43:56.051
You'll feel a searing light,

43:56.092 --> 43:58.636
but it won't burn.
You'll be a little nauseous,

43:58.678 --> 44:00.305
possibly light-headed
when you come out

44:00.347 --> 44:02.307
on the other side,
where you'll find yourself

44:02.349 --> 44:04.976
in shaft number two.
Follow the signs.

44:05.018 --> 44:07.020
You'll find your car
parked outside the mine.

44:07.062 --> 44:10.315
The portal will be activated
in exactly 48 hours.

44:10.357 --> 44:13.360
Put these on for the transit.

44:13.401 --> 44:16.488
Remember to wear them
on your return.

44:16.529 --> 44:18.531
Good luck, sir.

44:24.120 --> 44:26.122
MAN (over P.A.):
60%.

44:33.546 --> 44:35.173
70%.

44:39.719 --> 44:41.638
80%.

44:46.017 --> 44:48.311
90%.
