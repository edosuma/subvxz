00:21.880 --> 00:23.960
Mmm!
Mmm!

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
( Chirping )

00:48.680 --> 00:50.300
Hey, what's going on?

00:50.400 --> 00:52.380
We're done.
Dr. Langer gave us the order

00:52.480 --> 00:54.260
to pack up our stuff
and move out.

00:54.360 --> 00:56.500
Well,
if you're all done,

00:56.600 --> 00:59.140
then that means Pam and I aren't
working together anymore.

00:59.240 --> 01:00.820
I could ask her out
on a date!

01:00.920 --> 01:02.920
I got to find Pam!

01:06.800 --> 01:08.660
Mordecai: Come on.
Oh, man, come on!

01:08.760 --> 01:10.700
Aah!
No, no, no!

01:10.800 --> 01:12.860
( Gasps, coughing )

01:12.960 --> 01:15.860
I win! Whoa!

01:15.960 --> 01:17.500
Whatever!

01:17.600 --> 01:19.600
I don't even care,
'cause I'm graduating tomorrow!

01:19.520 --> 01:21.220
And we gonna parâtay!

01:21.320 --> 01:23.780
You ready for
my grad party, dude?!

01:23.880 --> 01:25.880
Of course.
I'm on the planning committee.

01:25.600 --> 01:27.100
Cool man!
What a year!

01:27.200 --> 01:29.200
I've been learning and growing
and doing so much ââ

01:29.120 --> 01:31.020
all while holding onto
a steady girlfriend!

01:31.120 --> 01:32.820
I'm really amazing,
you know!

01:32.920 --> 01:34.920
Man, the rate I'm going, I'll
probably get my college degree

01:35.000 --> 01:36.460
before you get yours!
(Laughs)

01:36.560 --> 01:38.380
Ha ha, yeah...

01:38.480 --> 01:41.260
Well, in my past year, I got
really good at this video game!

01:41.360 --> 01:43.580
( Cell phone rings )
Hold that thought, dude.

01:43.680 --> 01:45.220
Principal Dean?

01:45.320 --> 01:47.980
Hello?
Come to school now?

01:48.080 --> 01:49.420
Deadly serious?

01:49.520 --> 01:50.780
I'll talk to you later.

01:50.880 --> 01:52.260
Oh, no!
Graduation's cancelled!

01:52.360 --> 01:54.740
No graduation for Rigby!
Ha ha.

01:54.840 --> 01:56.840
Ha ââ uh...

01:59.040 --> 02:01.340
Come on, Principal Dean!
You can't fail me!

02:01.440 --> 02:03.260
Who said anything
about failing you?

02:03.360 --> 02:04.460
On the phone!

02:04.560 --> 02:06.100
You said it was
"deadly serious."

02:06.200 --> 02:08.180
Okay, I can see how that
could sound ominous,

02:08.280 --> 02:09.900
but this is good news!

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Are you familiar with
the television program

02:11.920 --> 02:13.180
"Inspire America"?

02:13.280 --> 02:15.280
You mean that cheesy show
with inspirational stories,

02:15.200 --> 02:17.240
then everybody cries, then
everybody dances at the end?

02:17.320 --> 02:19.060
That's the one!

02:19.160 --> 02:22.020
See, Rigby, apparently you're
an inspiration to this country.

02:22.120 --> 02:25.260
Most kids who drop out
don't come back, but you did.

02:25.360 --> 02:26.620
So you, Rigby,

02:26.720 --> 02:30.340
are gonna give this year's
graduation speech on TV!

02:30.440 --> 02:31.980
But graduation's tomorrow!

02:32.080 --> 02:33.460
Better get moving!

02:33.560 --> 02:36.340
Oh, and, Rigby, If you
screw this up for me,

02:36.440 --> 02:38.440
I'm gonna eat your diploma.

02:39.240 --> 02:41.500
Ha!
I'm just pulling your chain.

02:41.600 --> 02:43.740
Actually, no.
Yeah, I will eat it.

02:43.840 --> 02:45.340
( Moans )

02:45.440 --> 02:48.860
<i>Man: And now back to</i>
<i>"Inspire America!"</i>

02:48.960 --> 02:51.300
<i>And you've been baking cookies</i>
<i>for lawyers</i>

02:51.400 --> 02:52.580
<i>for how many years now?</i>

02:52.680 --> 02:53.740
<i>37.</i>

02:53.840 --> 02:55.220
<i>An eternity!</i>

02:55.320 --> 02:56.980
<i>And it never</i>
<i>occurred to you</i>

02:57.080 --> 02:59.100
<i>that lawyers probably</i>
<i>make enough money</i>

02:59.200 --> 03:01.020
<i>to buy cookies</i>
<i>if they want them?</i>

03:01.120 --> 03:02.620
<i>Never.</i>
<i>Not once.</i>

03:02.720 --> 03:04.140
<i>Amazing.</i>

03:04.240 --> 03:08.020
<i>But more than amazing ââ</i>
<i>inspiring.</i>

03:08.120 --> 03:11.740

03:13.800 --> 03:18.460

03:18.560 --> 03:20.900
That was so
inspirational!

03:21.000 --> 03:22.780
( Whimpering )
Don't worry, Rigby!

03:22.880 --> 03:24.900
It's so cool you're gonna be
on that show.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.220
I'm bummed I can't be there
for your graduation

03:27.320 --> 03:29.140
because I'm graduating
from college.

03:29.240 --> 03:31.140
No problem! We'll hang out
at my party after.

03:31.240 --> 03:34.300
If I've learned anything from my
extended high school education,

03:34.400 --> 03:36.900
it's that we have to seek beauty
and truth in the ordinary.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.700
The greatest mistake
a man can make

03:38.800 --> 03:40.940
is to search for flowers
among the weeds,

03:41.040 --> 03:42.860
overlooking the fact that,
oftentimes,

03:42.960 --> 03:44.380
the very weeds
are flowers.

03:44.480 --> 03:46.100
Wow.
That's great.

03:46.200 --> 03:48.020
Is that the beginning
of your speech?

03:48.120 --> 03:49.220
Pff, no!
But, actually,

03:49.320 --> 03:50.820
you want
to hear what I got so far?

03:50.920 --> 03:52.540
Sure, I guess.
Of course!

03:52.640 --> 03:54.640
Totally!
Okay, one sec.

03:56.560 --> 03:58.560
( Dramatic music plays )
Teachers!

03:57.840 --> 03:59.840
( Fake echoing )
Teachers, teachers...

03:59.040 --> 04:00.380
Students!

04:00.480 --> 04:02.480

Students, students...

04:01.680 --> 04:02.740

04:02.840 --> 04:04.140

Dees, dees, dees...

04:04.240 --> 04:06.260
Put your hands together for...

04:06.360 --> 04:10.860
The Rigâbone!

04:10.960 --> 04:14.060
( Dance music playing )

04:14.160 --> 04:15.580
How's everyone doââ

04:15.680 --> 04:16.740
Oof! (Groans)

04:16.840 --> 04:18.780
( Gasps )

04:18.880 --> 04:22.300
Y'all ready to be inspired
up in this piece?!

04:22.400 --> 04:23.500
Whoo, yeah!
Whoo, yeah!

04:23.600 --> 04:27.060
I said, are you ready
to be inspired?!

04:27.160 --> 04:29.060
Yeah! Whoo!
Yeah! Whoo!

04:29.160 --> 04:31.180
That's all I got so far.

04:31.280 --> 04:32.860
I don't know, Rigby.

04:32.960 --> 04:35.260
It just needs a lot more...

04:35.360 --> 04:36.900
Just a lot more.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.660
Just speaking as someone with
a lot of onâcamera experience,

04:39.760 --> 04:42.780
I don't know if
this will work...on camera.

04:42.880 --> 04:43.940
Not good, man.

04:44.040 --> 04:45.900
Okay, okay, good notes.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.620
Well, could you guys check out
my outro, maybe?

04:48.720 --> 04:49.780
Yeah, let's see it!

04:49.880 --> 04:52.580
High school goes by like
a puff of smoke!

04:52.680 --> 04:54.380
Peace out!

04:54.480 --> 04:56.480
( All screaming, coughing )

04:58.800 --> 05:00.260
Sorry I'm late, guys.

05:00.360 --> 05:02.100
Where've you been, bro?

05:02.200 --> 05:03.820
We could've used
some help gathering

05:03.920 --> 05:05.880
all of Rigby's favorite things
for this party.

05:05.960 --> 05:07.900
I mean, the trampoline's
not heavy,

05:08.000 --> 05:10.340
but it's a very awkward shape
to carry alone.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.700
No, not his
favorite belongings!

05:12.800 --> 05:14.340
His favorite things!

05:14.440 --> 05:16.540
Like hummus, mini toasts.

05:16.640 --> 05:18.420
Food and beverages!

05:18.520 --> 05:20.820
Well, how am I supposed
to surprise Rigby

05:20.920 --> 05:22.860
with his favorite foods
at his party

05:22.960 --> 05:24.700
if I don't even know
what they are?

05:24.800 --> 05:26.500
Mordecai,
you're his best friend.

05:26.600 --> 05:27.740
What does he like?

05:27.840 --> 05:29.700
I guess there's this fancy
coffee soda

05:29.800 --> 05:31.340
he's really into ââ
Coffini.

05:31.440 --> 05:33.340
Perfect, take my van.

05:33.440 --> 05:35.440
But it's seasonal!
I'd have to drive

05:34.960 --> 05:36.960
all the way out to the
Coffini Outlet to get it now.

05:36.880 --> 05:39.020
Then he'll be extra touched
that you took the time!

05:39.120 --> 05:40.420
Is all this really necessary?

05:40.520 --> 05:42.520
I mean, graduating
from high school

05:42.120 --> 05:43.940
is like the least a person
can accomplish.

05:44.040 --> 05:45.380
But it's a big deal
for Rigby!

05:45.480 --> 05:47.780
I can't believe I have
to explain this to him.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.060
He's your best
friend, dude.

05:49.160 --> 05:50.940
( Scoffs ) Fine.

05:51.040 --> 05:53.780
I'll be back
in a really long time!

05:53.880 --> 05:55.300
Man, what's with him?

05:55.400 --> 05:57.740
Okay, so we got Mordecai
on the soda,

05:57.840 --> 05:59.260
Eileen's got dessert.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.220
Hmm, anyone seen Benson?

06:01.320 --> 06:03.500
Pam? Pam!

06:03.600 --> 06:04.820
Pam!

06:04.920 --> 06:06.540
( Sighs )
This is hopeless.

06:06.640 --> 06:08.100
I've checked everywhere!

06:08.200 --> 06:10.220
( Gasps ) Pam!

06:10.320 --> 06:11.740
Not Pam.

06:11.840 --> 06:13.460
( Gasps )
There she is!

06:13.560 --> 06:14.700
( Hisses )

06:14.800 --> 06:16.340
( Grumbles )

06:16.440 --> 06:17.980
Ugh! What the...

06:18.080 --> 06:19.300
Gah!

06:19.400 --> 06:20.500
What the ââ

06:20.600 --> 06:21.820
Ugh!

06:21.920 --> 06:23.580
Pam?

06:23.680 --> 06:25.500
Are you kidding me!

06:25.600 --> 06:28.140
Pam! Pam! Pam?!

06:28.240 --> 06:31.220
( "Pam" echoing )

06:31.320 --> 06:32.820
( Sighs )

06:32.920 --> 06:34.100
( Cell phone rings )
Hello?

06:34.200 --> 06:35.820
Mordecai, I'm freaking out.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.920
I've been writing speeches all
day, and they're all junk!

06:38.000 --> 06:39.580
I'm running out of time.

06:39.680 --> 06:41.600
I don't know what to do, and all
my favorite stuff is gone?

06:41.680 --> 06:43.680
Where are you, dude!
I really need you over here!

06:43.480 --> 06:45.340
( Sighs ) Look, I really
can't do this right now.

06:45.440 --> 06:46.540
I'm busy.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.700
What? But...

06:47.800 --> 06:49.100
What do I do?

06:49.200 --> 06:50.900
I don't know.
You're so smart now,

06:51.000 --> 06:52.920
why don't you go listen to
a sad song and figure it out.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.860
Whoa, what?
Dude!

06:54.960 --> 06:56.100
I got to go.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.180
<i>( Dial tone )</i>

06:58.280 --> 07:01.860
Where a person can work up

07:01.960 --> 07:04.860
A mean, mean thirst

07:04.960 --> 07:10.680
After a hard day of nothing
much at all

07:12.520 --> 07:14.300
The summer's past

07:14.400 --> 07:16.060
It's too late

07:16.160 --> 07:18.900
To cut the grass

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
There ain't much
to make anyway in the fall

07:25.920 --> 07:29.340
And sometimes I

07:29.440 --> 07:32.740
Just stay in the mood

07:32.840 --> 07:35.620
And take my place in back

07:35.720 --> 07:39.260
It's a lot of miles

07:39.360 --> 07:42.820
You're like a picture
on a fridge

07:42.920 --> 07:46.860
That's never stocked
with food

07:46.960 --> 07:48.780
Used to live at home

07:48.880 --> 07:53.420
Now I stay at your house

07:53.520 --> 07:56.420
And everybody wants

07:56.520 --> 08:00.460
To be special here

08:00.560 --> 08:05.940
They call your name out
loud and clear

08:06.040 --> 08:13.100
Here comes the regular

08:13.200 --> 08:14.660
( Sighs )

08:14.760 --> 08:17.660
Time to rebuild the wall
around my heart.

08:17.760 --> 08:19.580
"The great wall of Benson."

08:19.680 --> 08:21.300
( Fax machine handshake )

08:21.400 --> 08:23.580
Oh, great,
more pointless orders.

08:23.680 --> 08:25.900
"Look behind you."

08:26.000 --> 08:27.140
( Gasps )

08:27.240 --> 08:29.820
Pam!
You're here!

08:29.920 --> 08:31.380
Yep, I'm here.
Hello!

08:31.480 --> 08:32.860
Hello!

08:32.960 --> 08:34.100
Wow. Phew.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.780
What a relief.

08:35.880 --> 08:37.880
I thought you were
leaving forever.

08:37.480 --> 08:39.620
Sounds like quite
the misunderstanding!

08:39.720 --> 08:41.660
( Chuckles ) I guess so.

08:41.760 --> 08:44.500
Oh, by the way, I ââ
I got you something.

08:44.600 --> 08:45.740
Wow!

08:45.840 --> 08:48.060
The Clip Master 5000.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.820
"Will you go out with me?"

08:50.920 --> 08:52.900
( Gasps )
You're asking me out?

08:53.000 --> 08:54.860
Yep.
( Laughs )

08:54.960 --> 08:56.260
Yes.
I say yes.

08:56.360 --> 08:58.620
Great.
You free tomorrow?

08:58.720 --> 09:00.740
Yes! No!

09:00.840 --> 09:02.940
It's Rigby's
graduation party.

09:03.040 --> 09:04.700
You...want to come?

09:04.800 --> 09:07.380
I'd love to!
Great!

09:07.480 --> 09:08.700
See you tomorrow, Benson.

09:08.800 --> 09:11.660
See you tomorrow.

09:11.760 --> 09:15.340
You're all about to hear a very
powerful speech from someone

09:15.440 --> 09:18.700
who has shown immense growth
over the last semester.

09:18.800 --> 09:21.140
Please welcome Rigby
to the stage!

09:21.240 --> 09:23.180
( Cheering )

09:23.280 --> 09:24.620

09:26.480 --> 09:29.700
Why?! Why?!

09:29.800 --> 09:31.140
( Stammers )

09:31.240 --> 09:32.540
( Distorted ) Well?

09:32.640 --> 09:36.140
Inspire us, Bananaâman.

09:36.240 --> 09:38.180
Oh, no!
I ââ uh...

09:38.280 --> 09:40.700
As many before me have said ââ
I mean, as they say

09:40.800 --> 09:42.940
when they're talking about stuff
such as things.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.040
( Booing )

09:47.640 --> 09:48.820
( Screams )

09:48.920 --> 09:50.260
( Panting )

09:50.360 --> 09:53.220
Aah! Ew!
Night sweat!

09:53.320 --> 09:55.480
( Grunting )

09:57.640 --> 09:59.540
( Ringing )

09:59.640 --> 10:00.940
What?

10:01.040 --> 10:02.260
Mordecai, what's going on!

10:02.360 --> 10:03.860
How are you still not here?!

10:03.960 --> 10:06.940
( Sighs ) Rigby, I just have
stuff to do, okay?

10:07.040 --> 10:09.040
You already said
you have stuff to do.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.600
Aren't you done
doing your stuff?

10:09.880 --> 10:11.620
No, I'm not done!

10:11.720 --> 10:13.720
What could you be doing that's
more important than this?

10:13.480 --> 10:15.480
Come on, dude.
You got to do this for yourself.

10:15.400 --> 10:16.780
I can't do
everything for you.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.340
What ââ bah!

10:18.440 --> 10:20.440
I've been doing stuff
for myself all spring!

10:19.840 --> 10:21.840
I haven't needed your help
all spring!

10:21.480 --> 10:22.940
Now the one time I do,

10:23.040 --> 10:25.040
and you're not doing anything
for me at all!

10:24.440 --> 10:27.320
Yeah, that's right.
I'm not doing anything for you.

10:34.400 --> 10:35.900
I mean, can you guys believe it?

10:36.000 --> 10:37.460
She's smart, she's funny,

10:37.560 --> 10:39.780
she's into Pâmail,
and she actually likes me!

10:39.880 --> 10:41.460
It's like a crazy dream!

10:41.560 --> 10:45.140
Yes, we're all delighted
on your behalf, Benson.

10:45.240 --> 10:48.220
Yeah, you've been alone
a long time.

10:48.320 --> 10:50.860
I don't understand why I had
to put on a suit for this!

10:50.960 --> 10:52.180
Hush, Sherm!

10:52.280 --> 10:54.420
Oh! Oh, I think
its almost starting!

10:54.520 --> 10:57.060
Ooh, thanks!
Got my mini TV ready!

10:57.160 --> 10:58.500
Bye!

10:58.600 --> 11:01.960
Class Valedictorian,
Eileen Roberts!

11:04.560 --> 11:07.980
We're gonna wring every drop
of sentiment from this kid!

11:08.080 --> 11:09.220
( Laughs maniacally )

11:09.320 --> 11:12.220
In five,
four three, two...

11:12.320 --> 11:13.980
We're live.

11:14.080 --> 11:16.800
( Upbeat music plays )

11:18.800 --> 11:21.380
We're here live at
West Anderson High,

11:21.480 --> 11:23.860
where one special student
is about to give

11:23.960 --> 11:25.460
the speech of his life.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.180
Oh, and here comes
the principal.

11:27.280 --> 11:28.940
( Cheering )

11:29.040 --> 11:31.360
Ladies and gentlemen, I've been
principal a long time now.

11:31.440 --> 11:34.220
I'll be honest, I thought most
kids today were empty vessels

11:34.320 --> 11:36.260
staring into the void
of their cell phones

11:36.360 --> 11:38.020
every second of every day.

11:38.120 --> 11:42.020
But that all changed when I met
one kid ââ uh, one man ââ

11:42.120 --> 11:46.340
one kidâsized man, who's been
a great inspiration this year.

11:46.440 --> 11:49.500
Ladies and gentlemen,
let me introduce Rigby!

11:49.600 --> 11:52.060
Uh, what on...

11:52.160 --> 11:53.220
( Screaming )

11:53.320 --> 11:56.140
Whoa, look!

11:56.240 --> 11:58.100
It's Rigby!

11:58.200 --> 12:00.440
West Anderson High
volleyball rules!

12:02.040 --> 12:03.620
Thanks for
the lift, Frank!

12:03.720 --> 12:06.500
Anything for my daughter's
exâboyfriend's best friend.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.900
Prepare to get
Rigby'd, America!

12:09.000 --> 12:10.700
Whoa!
Ugh!

12:10.800 --> 12:12.700
( All gasp )

12:12.800 --> 12:14.140
Taâda!

12:14.240 --> 12:16.300
( Cheering )

12:16.400 --> 12:18.180
Uh, okay.

12:18.280 --> 12:20.100
Rigby, everyone.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.820
Okay, uh...oh.

12:22.920 --> 12:24.060
( Clears throat )

12:24.160 --> 12:25.220
Hello, class.

12:25.320 --> 12:28.140
( "Class" echoing )

12:28.240 --> 12:29.660
( Gulps )

12:29.760 --> 12:32.500
Lot of...
A lot of people here.

12:32.600 --> 12:34.820
( Sighs )
Okay, uh...

12:34.920 --> 12:38.100
you may have noticed, I like
to make a big entrance.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.980
"Ask Mordecai for funny punch
line."

12:40.080 --> 12:41.380
( Groans )

12:41.480 --> 12:44.900
Oh, I guess I never got
around to, uh...

12:45.000 --> 12:48.940
( Whimpering )

12:49.040 --> 12:50.980
( Gasps )

12:51.080 --> 12:53.500
( Clears throat ) I...
Let me just, uh...

12:53.600 --> 12:54.820
Okay, hi.

12:54.920 --> 12:56.700
Let me ââ Let's do over.

12:56.800 --> 12:58.620
Let me do this over.

12:58.720 --> 13:00.300
Well, that's it, Rigby.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.580
You lost them, and there's
no one to bail you out now.

13:02.680 --> 13:04.900
Wait. Did I say that
into the mic?

13:05.000 --> 13:06.980
( Sighs )
This was all a prank!

13:07.080 --> 13:09.020
Uh...

13:09.120 --> 13:11.900
Be right back, everyone!

13:12.000 --> 13:13.140
( Murmuring )

13:13.240 --> 13:15.020
( Chuckles )

13:15.120 --> 13:17.620
Okay, haâha.
Well, that was unexpected!

13:17.720 --> 13:22.220
Guess I'll have to pidgeâin
while Rigby collects himself.

13:22.320 --> 13:23.540
( Nervous laugh )

13:23.640 --> 13:25.580
Sure could use
a cockatiel right now.

13:25.680 --> 13:28.940
Warren, can you get
some birds up here?

13:29.040 --> 13:31.260
( Murmuring )

13:31.360 --> 13:34.700
( Whimpering )

13:34.800 --> 13:36.660
( Can opens )

13:36.760 --> 13:38.500
Whoa!
Is that a Coffini?

13:38.600 --> 13:40.540
But those are out
of season!

13:40.640 --> 13:43.500
Yep. I went all the way to
the outlet, just for you, bro!

13:43.600 --> 13:44.700
( Chuckles )

13:44.800 --> 13:46.620
Hmm.
Seems a bit dusty...and dented.

13:46.720 --> 13:50.900
Heh. Well, look, I guess
I was mad at you.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.500
Ah!

13:52.600 --> 13:53.860
I noticed.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.960
The thing I don't get
though is why?

13:55.400 --> 13:56.780
I don't know, man.

13:56.880 --> 13:58.880
It's been a rough
couple of days for me.

13:58.160 --> 13:59.980
For you?
Yeah.

14:00.080 --> 14:02.740
Look, I know how messed up
this sounds,

14:02.840 --> 14:05.580
but it's hard to see you
doing so great.

14:05.680 --> 14:07.220
I guess I always
kind of liked that

14:07.320 --> 14:09.320
I was doing better
than you before.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.380
That does sound
really messed up.

14:10.480 --> 14:11.740
I know.

14:11.840 --> 14:13.840
But when I heard you
embarrassing yourself out there,

14:13.600 --> 14:15.220
I realized how
unfair I was being.

14:15.320 --> 14:17.940
I think it's awesome that you've
worked so hard to get here.

14:18.040 --> 14:20.020
You're graduating from
high school today, man!

14:20.120 --> 14:21.740
You did it!
I did it.

14:21.840 --> 14:24.820
And if you can do this,
then that means...

14:24.920 --> 14:27.020
Wait, don't say it.
Let me.

14:27.120 --> 14:30.420
And this scar I got when
I had a mole biopsied!

14:30.520 --> 14:32.820
The Rigâbone finally has
something to say!

14:32.920 --> 14:34.300
Oh, thank goodness!

14:34.400 --> 14:36.940
( Cheering )

14:37.040 --> 14:38.860
Sorry I left earlier, everyone.

14:38.960 --> 14:40.460
I'm not good
at this kind of thing.

14:40.560 --> 14:42.060
I'm not good at a lot of things.

14:42.160 --> 14:43.820
I wasn't even good
at high school.

14:43.920 --> 14:45.020
But that didn't matter.

14:45.120 --> 14:46.860
I just wanted
to accomplish something.

14:46.960 --> 14:48.140
And, yeah, maybe at first

14:48.240 --> 14:50.240
I was just trying to impress
my girlfriend.

14:50.160 --> 14:52.700
She's smart and cool and loves
rocks and modern dance.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.180
âHi, Eileen.
âHey, Rigby.

14:54.280 --> 14:56.280
<i>But I wouldn't be</i>
<i>standing up here</i>

14:55.880 --> 14:57.660
<i>if that was all there was</i>
<i>to it.</i>

14:57.760 --> 15:00.200
<i>You see, it's pretty easy not</i>
<i>to graduate from high school.</i>

15:00.280 --> 15:02.860
I did it by playing video games
and straightâup chilling.

15:02.960 --> 15:04.740
Then when I set out
to get my diploma,

15:04.840 --> 15:06.840
I figured life was gonna get
a lot harder.

15:06.520 --> 15:08.520
I took what I was told were
the easiest classes,

15:08.400 --> 15:11.940
<i>and I still had to do stuff,</i>
<i>like scale the wall of a cave.</i>

15:12.040 --> 15:14.040
<i>I had to go to China,</i>
<i>which is very far away,</i>

15:13.880 --> 15:15.880
<i>for those of you that</i>
<i>didn't go to high school.</i>

15:15.760 --> 15:18.900
I even had to beat a guy
in a takeout food race.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.660
Sounds pretty hard, right?

15:20.760 --> 15:22.380
Well, warning ââ

15:22.480 --> 15:25.380
<i>what I'm about to tell you</i>
<i>will blow your mind.</i>

15:25.480 --> 15:27.100
<i>Are you ready, America?</i>

15:27.200 --> 15:28.740
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!

15:28.840 --> 15:33.640
Once you do the hard stuff,
it becomes not that hard.

15:34.720 --> 15:36.460
I may not be the man
I used to be,

15:36.560 --> 15:38.500
the one who didn't graduate
from high school,

15:38.600 --> 15:40.020
but, unexpectedly, awesomely,

15:40.120 --> 15:42.260
I can still do
the fun stuff he did.

15:42.360 --> 15:44.820
In fact, my "Alley Fight Dudes
4" score has never been better.

15:44.920 --> 15:47.660
I've come a long, long way,
and in the end,

15:47.760 --> 15:50.300
I still get to be me,
but better.

15:50.400 --> 15:53.220
<i>Now, you're probably saying to</i>
<i>yourselves, "How'd he do it?"</i>

15:53.320 --> 15:54.860
<i>And "For why?"</i>

15:54.960 --> 15:58.740
The answer is, I did these
things for myself.

15:58.840 --> 16:00.460
Not to impress anyone,

16:00.560 --> 16:03.900
but because I'm surrounded
by impressive people,

16:04.000 --> 16:06.380
people who lifted me up
and showed me that

16:06.480 --> 16:08.580
it's possible to do great,
hard things.

16:08.680 --> 16:10.540
<i>Eileen, of course,</i>

16:10.640 --> 16:12.260
my best friend, Mordecai,

16:12.360 --> 16:15.980
my parents, and even Don,
in his own way, I guess.

16:16.080 --> 16:19.180
Yes, America,
today I may inspire you,

16:19.280 --> 16:21.660
but I'm just part of a larger
chain reaction!

16:21.760 --> 16:24.060
Let my success today lift you u

16:24.160 --> 16:26.940
so that you, too, can do great,
hard things!

16:27.040 --> 16:29.260
<i>And after you, more people!</i>

16:29.360 --> 16:31.180
I am gonna eat my crusts.

16:31.280 --> 16:33.580
I'm gonna eat
my leafy greens.

16:33.680 --> 16:35.660
And look!
Roy's walking!

16:35.760 --> 16:38.260
And after those people,
even more people!

16:38.360 --> 16:39.420
( Cheering )

16:39.520 --> 16:40.940
<i>Millions of people,</i>

16:41.040 --> 16:42.580
<i>all over the world,</i>

16:42.680 --> 16:45.620
<i>overcoming obstacles,</i>
<i>inspiring other people!</i>

16:45.720 --> 16:48.820
( Sobbing )

16:48.920 --> 16:50.740
( Upbeat music playing )

16:50.840 --> 16:54.380
( Cheering and sobbing )

16:54.480 --> 16:59.140
So, graduating class,
go out and do great things!

16:59.240 --> 17:01.340
( Cheering )

17:01.440 --> 17:03.780
( Laughing )
Good show!

17:03.880 --> 17:06.260
Yeah!
Even I feel inspired.

17:06.360 --> 17:07.700
( Beeping )

17:07.800 --> 17:09.100
Oh!
Our dome pagers.

17:09.200 --> 17:10.900
These have never
gone off before.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.940
You know who else
has never gone off, my ââ

17:14.040 --> 17:16.040
( Beeping )

17:18.720 --> 17:20.180
Back to the park?

17:20.280 --> 17:22.180
The scientists
already packed up and left.

17:22.280 --> 17:23.620
What could they need us for?

17:23.720 --> 17:25.980
I don't know,
but we'd better check it out

17:26.080 --> 17:27.380
in case Pam came back.

17:27.480 --> 17:31.100
I mean, in case
the scientists, uh...

17:31.200 --> 17:32.620
Nah.
I mean Pam.

17:32.720 --> 17:34.420
Back to the park,
everyone!

17:34.520 --> 17:35.740
( Cheering )

17:35.840 --> 17:37.020
( Beeping )

17:37.120 --> 17:39.180
Rigby!
Rigby!

17:39.280 --> 17:41.300
Here's your diploma,
safe and sound.

17:41.400 --> 17:42.420
Whoa!

17:42.520 --> 17:44.140
Attaboy, Rigby!

17:44.240 --> 17:46.420
Make your old man proud!

17:46.520 --> 17:48.520
Thanks for not eating my
diploma, Principal Dean!

17:48.600 --> 17:50.060
Party at the dome!

17:50.160 --> 17:51.260
( Cheers )

17:51.360 --> 17:53.060
Put 'er there!

17:53.160 --> 17:56.780
Okay.
Say "student loans!"

17:56.880 --> 17:58.140
Debt!
Debt!

18:00.560 --> 18:01.940
Go, go, go!

18:02.040 --> 18:04.720
( Tires squealing )

18:07.120 --> 18:10.620
Mr. Maellard, we're here!

18:10.720 --> 18:12.720
Dr. Langer?

18:18.240 --> 18:21.620
There's nobody here!

18:21.720 --> 18:23.020
That's it, I'm done!

18:23.120 --> 18:25.300
I'm tired of being made a fool.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.400
Nothing good has come
from this experiment.

18:27.240 --> 18:30.520
I'm taking this stupid thing ââ
( Ringing )

18:29.680 --> 18:31.660
( Fax handshake )

So this is gonna take
the dome off the park?

18:55.560 --> 18:58.780
( Sighs )
Only one way to find out.

20:52.280 --> 20:53.540
( Door opens )

20:53.640 --> 20:55.340
Surprise, Rigby!

banana souffle...

21:06.080 --> 21:07.500
Guys...

21:07.600 --> 21:10.820
