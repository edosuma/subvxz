03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
when you think youve gone.

03:08.040 --> 03:00.770
Much lower, the lower you go,

03:00.771 --> 03:03.090
When jeff said that we could.

03:03.940 --> 03:07.980
Down like a child on christmas.

03:08.000 --> 03:08.680
Were still in.

03:08.720 --> 03:09.720
Im not out of it.

03:09.750 --> 03:02.750
I am still playing "Survivor."

03:03.590 --> 03:11.590
my god.

03:33.730 --> 03:38.030
You look so good.

03:38.070 --> 03:43.340
We arrived at the merge, and.

03:43.370 --> 03:45.060
Of excitement and joy.

03:45.640 --> 03:50.050
We are going into this with all.

03:50.080 --> 03:52.780
Together some we have eight.

03:52.820 --> 03:55.020
Were going to have the.

03:55.050 --> 04:00.020
Thats an incredible feeling.

04:00.060 --> 04:03.490
How was distinction island?

04:03.530 --> 04:05.300
Its purgatory.

04:05.330 --> 04:07.300
The twist is right on your buff.

04:07.330 --> 04:00.700
You get a torch, theres map,

04:06.050 --> 04:14.050
The one person I thought,

04:23.060 --> 04:25.680
Like why are you back here now?

04:25.720 --> 04:30.820
I dont want him back here.

04:30.850 --> 04:35.330
How are you with the dad bod

04:35.360 --> 04:37.060
dad bod is back in the game.

04:37.090 --> 04:38.800
Im back, baby.

04:38.830 --> 04:40.000
Im back in the game.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.330
But there is definitely a fear.

04:42.370 --> 04:43.930
Out because you just came back.

04:43.970 --> 04:45.440
Maybe they resent it.

04:45.470 --> 04:46.570
Maybe its just easy.

04:46.600 --> 04:49.060
So I need to make a human.

04:49.640 --> 04:53.069
Dont write me off as the easy.

04:53.070 --> 04:54.150
Before they get to know me.

04:54.950 --> 04:59.550
I dont know how you feel in.

04:59.580 --> 05:02.090
Didnt know...

05:02.220 --> 05:05.890
So as much as I love them, im a

05:05.920 --> 05:09.790
the minute I start speaking.

05:09.830 --> 05:03.700
Knew that I really liked him,

05:03.730 --> 05:06.770
Person, just the fact that he.

05:06.800 --> 05:14.800
Able to win a spot back into.

05:20.440 --> 05:02.640
Him.

05:02.670 --> 05:10.670
I would never want to see him go.

05:25.440 --> 05:26.440
So quickly.

05:26.640 --> 05:29.070
I mean, it sounds like a scary.

05:29.750 --> 05:37.750
To.

05:39.790 --> 05:45.630
To.

05:45.660 --> 05:48.500
I new that coming ban was

05:48.530 --> 05:54.340
I needed.

05:54.370 --> 05:57.000
Other people, though, we get.

05:57.040 --> 05:57.870
Buyers remorse.

05:57.871 --> 06:00.240
Their journey is out of this

06:00.280 --> 06:02.619
after I lost, I honestly felt

06:02.620 --> 06:03.920
and then there was three.

06:03.960 --> 06:05.020
Then there was three.

06:05.060 --> 06:09.760
I dont think anyone has had.

06:09.800 --> 06:17.800
Everything that could have gone.

06:23.430 --> 06:26.999
End of the day, I feel so proud.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.470
Most important for me.

06:28.500 --> 06:30.060
How crazy.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.480
The edge of extinction will.

06:32.481 --> 06:36.000
The weak arent going to.

06:36.050 --> 06:39.250
Crumbling around me, I know just.

06:39.280 --> 06:43.290
Im going to get my butt back in

07:00.740 --> 07:03.040
im working with lauren.

07:03.070 --> 07:04.640
We have two idols.

07:04.670 --> 07:05.580
Thats a lot of power.

07:05.581 --> 07:09.089
We can do a lot with that if

07:09.090 --> 07:02.250
we need to find a crack.

07:02.280 --> 07:05.080
The problem is im in this.

07:05.220 --> 07:09.560
Im going to need every tool.

07:09.590 --> 07:02.020
That im in.

07:02.060 --> 07:10.060
So I, 000% have to have a talk

07:23.760 --> 07:26.530
how are you feeling about.

07:26.560 --> 07:03.840
I feel like were... I feel

07:03.870 --> 07:11.870
here I am again with joe.

07:40.080 --> 07:04.080
Here he is again in the majority.

07:04.840 --> 07:12.840
I feel like im at his mercy.

07:44.000 --> 07:44.820
Why?

07:44.850 --> 07:47.650
This is an absolute nightmare.

07:47.680 --> 07:48.950
Well see how welke pitch him.

07:48.990 --> 07:50.690
This is a sales pitch for me.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.760
I dont know how you feel act.

07:53.790 --> 07:54.260
Thing.

07:54.290 --> 07:55.460
I dont like it.

07:55.490 --> 08:00.530
I dont trust most of my kamas.

08:00.570 --> 08:06.300
Together, but me and aubry were

08:06.340 --> 08:07.370
Aurora was on the outs.

08:07.400 --> 08:08.900
I feel like im on the bottom.

08:08.940 --> 08:00.270
Its a weird state of limbo.

08:00.271 --> 08:04.340
I definitely see david and

08:04.380 --> 08:06.650
I see them shifting to that.

08:06.680 --> 08:08.480
That will try to take you out.

08:08.520 --> 08:16.520
Im not coming for you, joe.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.020
Im not coming for you.

08:22.050 --> 08:23.090
I need you here, too.

08:23.220 --> 08:26.020
I definitely feel like joe.

08:26.060 --> 08:30.960
Still trying to decipher, figure.

08:30.990 --> 08:35.929
So I think the best plan is to.

08:35.970 --> 08:39.000
Out rick.

08:39.039 --> 08:04.340
So now we have all the girls.

08:04.370 --> 08:12.370
What is this six girl, seven.

08:44.039 --> 08:45.080
What are you thinking?

08:45.000 --> 08:45.090
Whats the ideal?

08:45.940 --> 08:49.040
Im open to hearing all.

08:49.450 --> 08:52.480
We want to get through a safe.

08:52.520 --> 08:55.590
And ricks name kind of popped.

08:55.620 --> 08:58.020
He could be an easy vote that.

08:58.050 --> 08:58.890
With.

08:58.920 --> 09:00.020
That doesnt cross too many.

09:00.060 --> 09:05.060
I am shocked kelley and.

09:05.090 --> 09:07.900
First and send him right back to.

09:07.930 --> 09:00.730
Just from a moral standpoint,

09:00.770 --> 09:03.770
Possibly do that to somebody to.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.870
They came after facing the odds.

09:05.871 --> 09:08.070
I dont think ricks bad.

09:08.740 --> 09:16.740
I dont think it pisses anyone.

09:24.450 --> 09:29.690
I think we get rid of devens,

09:29.720 --> 09:30.520
Ill do it.

09:30.550 --> 09:33.060
Kelley and lauren seem so.

09:33.090 --> 09:38.330
Maybe one of them should be sent.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.030
Extinction.

09:50.040 --> 09:51.999
Thats a lot of pieces that

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
thats good right there.

09:54.040 --> 09:57.050
You guys need a hand?

09:57.080 --> 10:05.080
Not really.

20:00.020 --> 20:04.590
When I got back to camp, I.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.290
Little something there.

20:06.291 --> 20:08.800
Is sitting in my bag.

20:08.840 --> 20:16.840
And so I practically run down.

20:22.740 --> 20:29.089
Trail, I unwrap it, and... Holy.

20:29.090 --> 20:03.580
And its this beauty.

20:03.581 --> 20:11.581
Two pieces with a note.

20:36.050 --> 20:36.890
"Congratulations."

20:36.920 --> 20:39.290
You have earned your way back.

20:39.320 --> 20:40.820
Staying in may not be as easy.

20:40.860 --> 20:43.930
"This may help."

20:43.960 --> 20:47.030
You must give one half of this.

20:47.060 --> 20:49.900
If youre both still in the game.

20:49.930 --> 20:54.040
These two pieces when used.

20:54.070 --> 20:55.670
Full power.

20:55.700 --> 20:57.030
So its an immunity idol.

20:57.340 --> 20:58.340
I cant use it this time.

20:58.540 --> 20:59.640
I keep half of it.

20:59.680 --> 02:02.380
I give the other half to another.

02:02.381 --> 02:05.820
This may be the only bar.

02:05.850 --> 02:06.980
In the game.

02:07.020 --> 02:03.090
This idol has no power until.

02:03.020 --> 02:04.020
Holy crap.

02:04.060 --> 02:06.330
But its tricky because I cant.

02:06.360 --> 02:14.360
So I have to do what I have to.

02:29.840 --> 02:03.340
I have something to tell.

02:03.370 --> 02:11.370
I have an immunity idol.

02:32.840 --> 02:34.000
Are you serious?

02:34.040 --> 02:37.090
Yeah, but I have to

02:37.950 --> 02:38.060
okay.

02:38.650 --> 02:39.550
Before the tribal.

02:39.580 --> 02:04.220
Are you kidding me?

02:04.250 --> 02:12.250
Yeah.

02:42.420 --> 02:44.990
Davids the one I can trust.

02:45.020 --> 02:48.020
Like if I have to work this idol.

02:48.060 --> 02:50.930
Share it with my closest ally.

02:50.960 --> 02:54.000
So obviously im planning on.

02:54.030 --> 02:57.030
If either of us gets voted out,

02:57.070 --> 03:05.070
for the first vote, its not.

22:00.040 --> 22:02.069
Its just a bargaining chip.

22:02.070 --> 22:04.069
I feel like I might be on the.

22:04.070 --> 22:04.750
So im scared to death going.

22:04.751 --> 22:12.751
So im scared to death going.

22:22.060 --> 22:25.930
Come on in, guys.

22:32.270 --> 22:33.340
All right.

22:33.370 --> 22:36.090
Lets get to your first.

22:36.940 --> 22:38.999
First things first, ron.

22:39.000 --> 22:04.040
Got to take back tribal.

22:04.080 --> 22:12.080
Thank you.

22:44.020 --> 22:46.420
Tribal immunity no more.

22:46.450 --> 22:49.820
This is now what you covet.

22:49.850 --> 22:05.550
The individual immunity.

22:05.590 --> 22:13.590
Lets get to it.

22:53.890 --> 22:57.290
For todays challenge, youre.

22:57.330 --> 23:00.760

23:00.800 --> 23:04.300

23:04.330 --> 23:08.000
If at any point you fall off the.

23:08.040 --> 23:09.040
Youre out.

23:09.340 --> 23:02.670
Last person left standing wins.

23:02.671 --> 23:05.019
Losers tribal council where.

23:05.020 --> 23:07.750
Person voted out of this game.

23:07.780 --> 23:08.750
Take your spots.

23:08.780 --> 23:16.780
Well get started.

23:20.320 --> 23:25.520
Good luck.

23:25.560 --> 23:26.860

23:26.890 --> 23:28.090

23:28.220 --> 23:33.500
And this challenge is on, and.

23:33.530 --> 23:35.800

Your first individual immunity

23:43.040 --> 23:46.079
3 people in the game.

23:46.080 --> 23:48.030
Devens earned his way back in.

23:48.340 --> 23:05.850
Could he pull it off right here?

23:05.880 --> 23:13.880
Little bit of movement.

23:53.520 --> 23:58.050
From victoria now.

23:58.090 --> 23:59.090
Gavin drops.

23:59.220 --> 24:00.420

24:00.460 --> 24:07.860
We are down to.

24:07.900 --> 24:08.800
All right.

24:08.830 --> 24:02.340
It is time now to move further.

24:02.370 --> 24:04.070
Its more narrow, more.

24:04.200 --> 24:05.040
Start making your move.

24:05.070 --> 24:07.070
This is a live transition.

24:07.740 --> 24:15.740
So if you drop here, you are.

24:23.950 --> 24:25.520

24:50.470 --> 24:53.000

Joe has been very

27:35.740 --> 27:43.019
Lauren really has the front of

27:43.020 --> 27:44.060
Joe drops out of nowhere.

27:44.650 --> 27:46.820
He had been rock steady.

27:46.850 --> 27:48.680
And were down to two.

27:48.720 --> 27:50.690
Julie and lauren.

27:50.720 --> 27:54.520
Here comes the wind now making

27:54.560 --> 27:55.920
Lauren moving all over.

27:55.960 --> 27:58.630
That statue holding firm.

27:58.660 --> 28:00.960
That wind no joke.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.540
Really blowing.

28:05.570 --> 28:06.340
Crap.

28:06.370 --> 28:06.250
Another gust of wind.

28:06.280 --> 28:07.280
Crap.

28:07.281 --> 28:15.281
Lauren drops.

28:20.350 --> 28:27.520
Julie wins first individual.

28:27.560 --> 28:27.790
Council.

28:27.820 --> 28:28.260
Wow.

28:28.290 --> 28:30.060
That was sudden.

28:30.090 --> 28:32.029
Iauren, great job.

28:32.030 --> 28:34.000
Great job, lady.

28:50.380 --> 28:51.620
Safe tonight at tribal council.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.820
If you can express what it means.

28:54.850 --> 28:56.020

28:56.050 --> 28:59.890
I feel like ive been wanting.

28:59.920 --> 29:05.029

29:28.050 --> 29:03.450
Everyone, and everyone appears.

29:03.490 --> 29:11.490
Many different ways that it.

29:32.920 --> 29:35.860
All I know is that I have a.

29:35.890 --> 29:39.330
Im very excited that I have.

29:39.360 --> 29:43.430
Playing "Survivor" before, I.

29:43.470 --> 29:46.470
The merge, so I might have to.

30:04.060 --> 30:06.900
Tonight, but the fact that ill.

30:06.930 --> 30:14.930

30:25.470 --> 30:32.050
im dying to talk to you.

30:32.080 --> 30:39.050
Kelley and lauren, we could.

30:39.090 --> 30:39.990
Kelley out.

30:40.020 --> 30:04.420
Kelley is a huge threat.

30:04.460 --> 30:12.460
As a returning player, she needs.

30:43.230 --> 30:47.860
These are the kinds of things I.

30:47.900 --> 30:48.999
Orchestrateing.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.870
Im not just going along with.

30:50.900 --> 30:54.870

30:54.900 --> 30:58.029
Everyone on your tribe is.

30:58.030 --> 30:59.310

30:59.840 --> 03:02.030
Theres in way in hell I would.

03:02.340 --> 03:03.340
Have to trust me.

03:03.650 --> 03:05.060
We know you and david look like.

03:05.061 --> 03:07.530
I feel totally betrayed by.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.500
Me right back is a total stab in.

03:09.530 --> 03:17.530
But I got people on my side

03:23.730 --> 03:25.770
well, let me give you this.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.970
This is the half of the immunity

03:28.000 --> 03:29.640
okay.

03:29.670 --> 03:32.080
Julie said all of lesu is.

03:32.840 --> 03:35.050
They have no qualms about voting

03:35.540 --> 03:39.250

03:39.280 --> 03:42.420
julie said vote with us

03:42.450 --> 03:44.790

But they will tell me, and then.

03:47.920 --> 03:48.490

03:48.520 --> 03:48.890
It should be wentworth.

03:48.920 --> 03:49.590
I agree.

03:49.620 --> 03:05.060
Thanks for this, by the way.

03:05.090 --> 03:13.090
It means a lot.

03:52.430 --> 03:53.630
Were in it together.

03:53.660 --> 03:54.600
We are, dude.

03:54.630 --> 03:56.570
A whole will the on the line

03:56.600 --> 03:58.300
I feel like if I can get through.

03:58.330 --> 03:59.370
Hidden immunity idol.

03:59.400 --> 04:07.400
It could be a whole new.

32:00.040 --> 32:04.840
It might be the path forward in

32:04.870 --> 32:06.280
right back to work, joe.

32:06.281 --> 32:08.020
Got to finish it, bro.

32:08.240 --> 32:05.220
We got work to do.

32:05.250 --> 32:06.490
Want to go right now?

32:06.520 --> 32:07.390
Ill go.

32:07.420 --> 32:08.250
Okay.

32:08.290 --> 32:02.090
Lets go.

32:02.091 --> 32:10.091
Hey, buddy.

32:22.060 --> 32:24.760
Hey.

32:24.790 --> 32:26.090
Whats the plan?

32:26.230 --> 32:27.400
What do I do?

32:27.430 --> 32:03.670
You go follow those guys and.

32:03.700 --> 32:11.700
Chopping block tonight.

32:34.040 --> 32:34.870
Okay.

32:34.900 --> 32:36.440
I hope not.

32:36.470 --> 32:38.040
Who do you want to vote for?

32:38.440 --> 32:39.440
I dont know, man.

32:39.940 --> 32:04.240
This game moves fast, so a.

32:04.280 --> 32:12.280
People get together and want the

32:46.080 --> 32:48.250
joe made a mistake.

32:48.280 --> 32:50.790
Joe, who do I voted for, whats.

32:50.820 --> 32:05.790
He was very vague.

32:05.820 --> 32:13.820
It did not make me feel good.

32:53.460 --> 32:54.960
Joe is brushing me aside.

32:54.990 --> 32:57.790
Right now I dont know that I.

32:57.830 --> 33:00.260
What he doesnt know is my true

33:00.300 --> 33:05.670
Julie, julia, gavin, and.

33:05.700 --> 33:09.040
So im thinking joe losing is a.

33:09.070 --> 33:02.980
Youre playing "Survivor" and.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.056
Every time is the right time.

33:04.080 --> 33:07.090
And so ive got to convince the

33:07.950 --> 33:08.980
there they are.

33:09.000 --> 33:17.000
Guys, theyre here.

33:20.250 --> 33:25.650
Theres one, two, right here.

33:25.690 --> 33:26.090
He doesnt have an idol.

33:26.220 --> 33:27.420
Hes not expecting it.

33:27.460 --> 33:28.420
Just the six?

33:28.460 --> 33:29.660
What do you mean?

33:32.030 --> 33:33.630
Focus on that one.

33:33.660 --> 33:35.300
Focus on that one.

33:35.330 --> 33:37.030
Go slow, guys.

33:37.070 --> 33:37.900
Dang.

33:37.930 --> 33:39.840
We might have lost him for

33:39.870 --> 33:42.000
round one goes to the

33:42.040 --> 33:44.999
ron wants to do joe, because.

33:45.000 --> 33:50.000
Now is the time to get rid of

33:50.050 --> 33:54.520
I would rather go the safer.

33:54.550 --> 33:56.890
But its definitely important to.

33:56.920 --> 34:02.290
Its

34:02.320 --> 34:05.730
I already talked to julia.

34:05.760 --> 34:06.960
Okay.

34:03.840 --> 34:04.870
Where are you?

34:04.900 --> 34:07.540
Id a go kelley.

34:07.570 --> 34:08.639
Kelley?

34:08.670 --> 34:09.060
Kelley.

34:09.639 --> 34:11.320
Theres a lot of different

34:22.000 --> 34:24.250
Joe being one of them.

34:24.280 --> 34:26.050
Ive heard ricks name thrown.

34:26.080 --> 34:29.389
Ive heard kelley wentworths.

34:29.420 --> 34:03.720
Theres three very good options.

34:03.750 --> 34:11.750
We need to figure out which one

34:33.889 --> 34:35.560
lets check in.

34:35.590 --> 34:38.530
Im pretty sure were all on the

34:38.560 --> 34:44.670
I think we have to take a shot

34:44.699 --> 34:46.900
too soon to get rid of joe.

34:46.940 --> 34:05.000
Listen, I can see the.

34:05.040 --> 34:13.040
Kelley.

34:52.040 --> 34:54.050
It can go a million different.

34:54.540 --> 35:00.019
Of us have to come to a

35:00.020 --> 35:03.350
there is not a general.

35:03.390 --> 35:07.020
Voted out, because all of us can.

35:07.060 --> 35:09.660
Kelley or joe should be voted.

35:09.690 --> 35:00.530
Good cases.

35:03.030 --> 35:06.300
It is really important to make.

35:06.330 --> 35:09.800
Very first vote right at the.

35:09.840 --> 35:17.840
The game.

35:42.560 --> 35:50.560
If you dont yet have.

35:50.630 --> 35:56.000
Well now bring in the members

35:56.040 --> 35:57.740
whats happening?

35:57.770 --> 36:05.770
Boy.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.980
Reem, chris, and.

36:06.860 --> 36:08.060
All right.

36:08.090 --> 36:02.360
Julie, what was the feeling with.

36:02.400 --> 36:10.400
Merging?

36:22.230 --> 36:24.630
Was it this could be fantastic

36:24.670 --> 36:27.840
it was the feeling, but we.

36:27.870 --> 36:03.270
New supreme, peek speak to them,

36:03.271 --> 36:11.271
We havent been able to before

36:33.040 --> 36:35.079
Ron, you had a.

36:35.080 --> 36:37.250
I love kama.

36:37.280 --> 36:37.780
Everyone knows this.

36:37.781 --> 36:40.050
I didnt want to swap.

36:40.080 --> 36:43.020
I look down and saw the yellow.

36:43.050 --> 36:46.390
Then I look down and saw a bunch.

36:46.420 --> 36:47.520
Im like, this is awesome.

36:47.560 --> 36:49.460
Wentworth, are you.

36:49.490 --> 36:05.560
Hear ron say hes glad kama

36:05.590 --> 36:13.590
im in the minority.

36:53.030 --> 36:56.600
It doesnt make me super.

36:56.630 --> 36:58.800
Days a lot of new relationships

36:58.830 --> 37:01.999
I dont know its so cut and.

37:02.000 --> 37:06.000
One of the other big.

37:06.040 --> 37:07.740
You earned your way back into

37:02.720 --> 37:06.520
all right I dont know the.

37:06.550 --> 37:14.550
Plus I havent met anyone on the.

37:20.960 --> 37:22.590
I spent all my time in.

37:22.620 --> 37:25.960
Was there any talk to.

37:25.990 --> 37:27.630
Voted him out once?

37:27.660 --> 37:28.900
Absolutely not.

37:28.930 --> 37:03.530
To send imright back, there.

37:03.570 --> 37:11.570
Opinion.

37:32.800 --> 37:35.700
Why would we get rid of somebody.

37:35.740 --> 37:38.000
Into the merge?

37:38.040 --> 37:40.090
I just think there are bigger

37:40.940 --> 37:42.740
Joe, what do you read

37:42.780 --> 37:45.039
victoria said there are.

37:45.040 --> 37:47.850
As a stronger player, that

37:47.880 --> 37:05.450
I now have to have many I little.

37:05.490 --> 37:13.490
I dont think I said physical.

37:55.060 --> 37:57.029
Because there are other kinds of.

37:57.030 --> 37:58.290
There are strategic threats in.

37:58.330 --> 38:00.430
Did I take it the wrong way.

38:00.460 --> 38:02.660
Me then it was accurate?

38:02.700 --> 38:05.870
There are other things that.

38:05.900 --> 38:08.040
The clear up what I meant.

38:08.070 --> 38:00.040
Ron, what about.

38:05.640 --> 38:06.350
Anyone has one.

38:06.380 --> 38:07.650
No one is mentioning it.

38:07.680 --> 38:09.080
It seems like they dont exist.

38:09.081 --> 38:17.081
Every season you feel that.

38:22.650 --> 38:24.750
Idols pop up in the same tribal.

38:24.790 --> 38:27.920
So if there are some idols out.

38:27.960 --> 38:29.020
That information.

38:29.060 --> 38:32.999
Devon, what was the.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.660
Was it casual?

38:34.700 --> 38:36.470
Was it frenetic.

38:36.500 --> 38:37.600
Did paranoia kick?

38:37.630 --> 38:04.670
When it came to strategy,

38:04.700 --> 38:12.700
Theyre going after.

38:42.800 --> 38:45.070
Joe didnt do anything today.

38:45.740 --> 38:46.840
He just painted.

38:46.870 --> 38:49.029
Are you that comfortable that.

38:49.030 --> 38:05.880
Anybody, or are you that scared.

38:05.881 --> 38:13.881
Anybody.

38:52.030 --> 38:53.650
It was weird.

38:53.680 --> 38:54.980
What was it, joe?

38:55.020 --> 38:57.520
I know where I stand with

38:57.550 --> 39:00.260
I home that kama strong does.

39:00.290 --> 39:03.360
Im relying on those past.

39:03.390 --> 39:04.460
This evening.

39:04.490 --> 39:06.390
Jeff, when you have the.

39:06.430 --> 39:07.430
Scramble so much.

39:07.460 --> 39:09.630
We were relaxed because we knew.

39:09.660 --> 39:02.740
We didnt need to scramble.

39:02.770 --> 39:04.370
Wow.

39:04.400 --> 39:06.039
Wentworth, thats so frustrating

39:06.040 --> 39:02.080
you kind of chuckle, because.

39:02.081 --> 39:10.081
Said, that but if youre me,

39:24.850 --> 39:25.030
So...

39:25.350 --> 39:25.080

39:25.850 --> 39:27.620
Time to vote.

39:27.650 --> 39:35.650
