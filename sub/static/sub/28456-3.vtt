WEBVTT

00:04.400 --> 00:05.720
We're looking for someone.

00:05.760 --> 00:07.800
- Do you know who that man is?
- I don't know this man.

00:07.840 --> 00:10.280
Do you know who Maria Meng is?

00:10.320 --> 00:13.040
She's not Maria Meng any more.
She is Senator Dubecki.

00:13.080 --> 00:17.320
We're working on a story. He's Chinese
and we think he might be undocumented.

00:17.360 --> 00:19.560
His name is Wang Pengfei,
or Jimmy Wang?

00:19.600 --> 00:21.520
Because we all know
each other, right?

00:21.560 --> 00:24.760
"Lee, this is Alex Sguerra again.
It's about your Syria picture."

00:24.800 --> 00:26.800
Alex Sguerra, photojournalist.
Know her?

00:26.840 --> 00:29.880
- I work for a newspaper!
- You WORKED for a newspaper.

00:35.080 --> 00:36.480
Joy! Joy?

00:40.480 --> 00:41.760
Agh!

00:41.800 --> 00:45.040
Look over the stuff and take pictures
of anything that looks interesting.

00:45.080 --> 00:47.480
"My friends tell me
you are looking for the Tank Man.

00:47.520 --> 00:49.480
"My name is Tang Wen Lei."

00:49.520 --> 00:53.880
- "Mr Tang, can I call you right back?"
- No, Lee. I will call you.

00:53.920 --> 00:57.760
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump
hitting the battlegrounds hard

00:57.800 --> 00:59.880
in this final stretch
of the campaign.

00:59.920 --> 01:03.440
A series of new CNN polls
shows a tightening race,

01:03.480 --> 01:05.360
especially in the swing states,

01:05.400 --> 01:08.720
with just five days away
from Election Day.

01:08.760 --> 01:11.280
"Let's check in with CNN's..."
- Do you think you can help?

01:11.320 --> 01:13.080
I don't know.

01:13.120 --> 01:16.440
He says he's a freedom fighter, the
Communist Party says he's a criminal.

01:16.480 --> 01:19.960
But he's the only lead I have
on the Tank Man right now.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.160
I sent the photos that you took of the accounts
at the flower shop to Zhang Lin to translate.

01:25.200 --> 01:29.280
It was a bunch of cheques that he wrote back in the
'90s, he says were made out to Maria Meng.

01:29.320 --> 01:32.040
Oh! Senator Dubecki!

01:32.080 --> 01:34.120
Wow! It's a bit like
Watergate, isn't it?

01:34.160 --> 01:36.120
You do realise with Watergate,

01:36.160 --> 01:39.600
it was the people breaking in
who were the bad guys, right?

01:41.400 --> 01:43.680
- It will be OK.
- Yeah.

01:45.680 --> 01:47.480
- Come here.
- Oh, sort me out.

01:47.520 --> 01:50.560
- Don't be nervous.
- OK.

01:50.600 --> 01:51.960
You know, the best thing is,

01:52.000 --> 01:55.320
they let you fly the plane.
I don't think they're going to let me do that!

01:55.360 --> 01:57.920
All you need is, uh,

01:57.960 --> 02:00.440
a special pen.

02:00.480 --> 02:03.000
See? And then you just...

02:03.040 --> 02:06.120
...do that to take off
and then that to land.

02:06.160 --> 02:08.560
So if you take that with you,
you'll be fine.

02:09.600 --> 02:10.280
Come here.

02:10.320 --> 02:11.920
Stop! No!

02:11.960 --> 02:13.560
Actually,
let's not start that again.

02:13.600 --> 02:16.400
I need to go. Open the door.

02:19.560 --> 02:20.320
Right.

02:20.360 --> 02:21.840
Bye! Bye!

02:24.560 --> 02:27.000
I'll call you from Beijing!

02:35.900 --> 02:40.180
Hi. Yeah. Yes. Can I leave a message
for Senator Dubecki, please?

02:41.180 --> 02:45.140
Yeah, this is Lee Berger. I'm a
journalist with the New York Courier.

02:45.180 --> 02:48.060
Can you just tell her
I'm not interested in whatever

02:48.061 --> 02:50.940
donation she got from
the Glorious City Flower Shop.

02:50.980 --> 02:54.180
I just need an address
for Wang Pengfei.

02:55.420 --> 02:58.380
Wang Pengfei. P-E-N-G-F-E-I.

02:58.420 --> 03:03.420
Yes, this number. That's right.
Thank you. Thank you. Bye.

04:01.980 --> 04:05.260
My friends, the future is coming.

04:05.300 --> 04:09.180
For thousands of years of Chinese
history, we have been good citizens.

04:09.220 --> 04:13.340
"We never asked for anything,
we did as we were told.

04:13.380 --> 04:15.060
"But today, we have the internet,

04:15.100 --> 04:19.140
"we have social media.
We can speak for ourselves.

04:19.180 --> 04:22.820
"So this is a message for you,
my 200,000 friends.

04:22.860 --> 04:27.020
"Now is the time for us to finish
the work we started in '89."

04:27.060 --> 04:28.580
I'm here to see Tang Wen Lei.

04:28.620 --> 04:32.980
"Now is the time to end the
corruption, the lies, the fake news.

04:33.020 --> 04:36.660
"Now is the time
for democracy in China!"

04:36.700 --> 04:39.980
So glad you found us, Mr Berger.

04:40.980 --> 04:44.380
Mr Tang is just finishing
his workout.

04:55.300 --> 04:57.140
Lee! So glad you made it!

04:57.180 --> 04:59.980
Mr Tang. Good to meet you.

05:00.020 --> 05:02.020
Sit, sit!

05:02.060 --> 05:03.980
Thank you, Eileen.

05:06.820 --> 05:11.100
I think what you are doing
is very important.

05:11.140 --> 05:14.220
'89 could happen again.

05:14.260 --> 05:16.940
Another Tiananmen.

05:16.980 --> 05:19.060
It just needs the right spark.

05:19.100 --> 05:22.340
This is why it's so important
you find him,

05:22.380 --> 05:27.100
the man who stood up to the tanks.

05:27.140 --> 05:30.420
- I'd like to help you.
- Great.

05:30.460 --> 05:32.140
So, what can you tell me?

05:32.180 --> 05:33.740
You first.

05:33.780 --> 05:36.820
Sir, with all due respect...

05:36.860 --> 05:41.060
It's not your life
that is in danger.

05:42.420 --> 05:45.580
Lee,
my company became too successful.

05:45.620 --> 05:47.820
Now the Party
has turned on me again.

05:47.860 --> 05:51.060
I have a $45 million apartment

05:51.100 --> 05:52.860
but no citizenship

05:52.900 --> 05:55.940
and an Interpol notice on my head!

05:59.900 --> 06:03.380
Do you have a name, Lee?

06:07.420 --> 06:09.420
Chang Song.

06:09.460 --> 06:11.860
Do you know him?

06:11.900 --> 06:13.220
Yes.

06:13.260 --> 06:15.780
Song was a good friend!

06:15.820 --> 06:19.460
I helped him escape
to Hong Kong after.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.900
Paid for his flight to Canada.

06:21.940 --> 06:24.660
After that, I lost contact with him.

06:24.700 --> 06:26.860
Wow!

06:26.900 --> 06:29.300
That's incredible!

06:29.340 --> 06:34.420
Are there any distinguishing details
that you can tell me?

06:34.460 --> 06:36.860
- Was he tall, was he short?
- Medium.

06:36.900 --> 06:38.980
Medium?

06:39.020 --> 06:40.660
And black hair.

06:40.700 --> 06:43.180
Black hair?

06:43.220 --> 06:44.980
Black hair.

06:45.020 --> 06:47.380
OK.

06:47.420 --> 06:50.940
Any idea why he might know
Senator Dubecki?

06:50.980 --> 06:52.780
Maria?

06:53.980 --> 06:57.420
- What, you know her?
- In the '90s. A long time ago.

06:57.460 --> 06:59.180
Ancient history.

06:59.220 --> 07:00.540
Eileen?

07:00.580 --> 07:03.500
I'd like Lee to meet Justin Bieber.

07:11.700 --> 07:13.420
Be careful.

07:13.460 --> 07:17.300
There are people who want
to find him as much as you do.

07:17.340 --> 07:20.740
They are probably
watching you already.

07:20.780 --> 07:22.260
Ah!

07:22.300 --> 07:25.900
There he is, my little popstar!

07:25.940 --> 07:28.500
Isn't he cute? Mm!

07:28.540 --> 07:32.580
He was lying to me. He was lying
the second I walked in the door.

07:32.620 --> 07:36.980
But he knows Maria Dubecki and I think he knows
more about Wang Pengfei than he's letting on.

07:37.020 --> 07:39.220
You can't keep coming here.

07:39.260 --> 07:44.340
And you have to stop leaving batshit
messages with Maria Dubecki's office!

07:44.380 --> 07:47.620
Her secretary called to ask
if you had PTSD.

07:47.660 --> 07:50.060
She left me a helpline
number for you!

07:50.100 --> 07:51.420
- You want it?
- No.

07:51.460 --> 07:54.220
Do you know where
Dubecki's going to be tonight?

07:54.260 --> 07:57.380
North Carolina.
There's a Clinton rally.

07:57.420 --> 08:00.260
- Why? - Because when I went
back to the flower shop,

08:00.300 --> 08:03.060
Wang Pengfei was gone
and Dubecki helped him do it.

08:03.100 --> 08:05.100
But he's illegal
so he's not gone far.

08:05.140 --> 08:08.580
Wait. Why are you so sure
that Maria is involved?

08:08.620 --> 08:11.980
You saw how fast she shut it down
when we asked about Wang Pengfei.

08:12.020 --> 08:14.540
It could be because
she's from that neighbourhood,

08:14.580 --> 08:17.580
she cares about those people
and she's a good fucking person!

08:17.620 --> 08:19.740
Oh, come on!
She's clearly hiding something!

08:19.780 --> 08:23.180
Don't be cynical. It's lazy.

08:25.980 --> 08:29.460
Frank wants to know if you're
still coming to the election lunch.

08:29.500 --> 08:32.340
- Am I invited?
- Sure.

08:32.380 --> 08:34.179
It's tradition.

08:34.220 --> 08:36.220
I've got to get back to work.

08:36.260 --> 08:38.740
I'll see you later, OK?

10:01.220 --> 10:02.720
Mr Tang, how can I help you?

10:02.721 --> 10:06.220
"I came to you because the man
you are looking for is important.

10:06.260 --> 10:08.780
"I can help you find him,
if you let me,

10:08.820 --> 10:11.140
"not play silly games
with fake names.

10:11.180 --> 10:12.660
"Chang Song!"

10:12.700 --> 10:16.980
The thing is, Mr Tang, I don't think you do
anything unless there's something in it for you.

10:17.020 --> 10:20.380
I want another '89!
I want a democratic China.

10:20.420 --> 10:23.180
You only want a democratic China
so they don't throw you in jail.

10:23.220 --> 10:26.940
- Is that such a bad reason?
- Well, help me out with something, then.

10:26.980 --> 10:29.340
You said you knew Maria Dubecki
in the '90s?

10:29.380 --> 10:32.100
I was aware of her. We all were.

10:32.140 --> 10:35.580
How come? - "The White House
is like the subway, Lee."

10:35.620 --> 10:37.660
You have to put in coins
to open the gates.

10:37.700 --> 10:40.220
Everybody knows it
but no-one likes to talk about it.

10:40.260 --> 10:43.260
What are you saying?
That she took donations from China?

10:43.300 --> 10:46.780
If she did,
the evidence will be hard to find.

10:46.820 --> 10:50.220
"Maria was camera-shy back in '96.

10:50.260 --> 10:52.260
"Lee, I have to go."

11:05.160 --> 11:06.840
Hey.

12:30.800 --> 12:33.520
Hey, Hannah. I don't have my pass.

12:33.560 --> 12:37.440
That's probably because you don't work
here any more. - I know. It's just...

12:37.480 --> 12:39.160
...I'm here for our meeting.

12:39.200 --> 12:42.080
What? We don't have a...

12:42.120 --> 12:43.720
Oh.

12:55.160 --> 12:57.440
You better be quick.
People are mad at you up here.

12:57.480 --> 13:00.880
I'm mad at you. - I know, I'm sorry.
I just need to get into the morgue.

13:00.920 --> 13:04.880
Hey, your girlfriend's on TV. - "This is not
just a native issue, it's an American issue."

13:04.920 --> 13:07.040
She almost got me arrested.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.760
She's not my girlfriend any more.

13:08.800 --> 13:13.120
I'm looking for anything on Maria
Dubecki, or Maria Meng, from 1986,

13:13.160 --> 13:16.680
anything on political donations,
especially with a Chinese connection.

13:16.720 --> 13:18.920
So now there are, like,
eight million images down here.

13:18.960 --> 13:21.960
Anything pre '98
is going to be hard copy only.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.960
There's a computer system but...

13:25.000 --> 13:27.760
..it might take you a while.

13:27.800 --> 13:29.600
Thank you.

13:54.720 --> 13:56.880
4373...

14:13.600 --> 14:16.000
"Questions asked over
Democrat Party Funding."

14:18.160 --> 14:21.560
Hsi Lai Temple, California.

15:15.400 --> 15:19.320
- That's Senator Dubecki, right?
- Yeah. So?

15:19.360 --> 15:23.280
So, any chance you remember that
Clinton campaign finance scandal of '96?

15:23.320 --> 15:25.880
Yeah. I was, like, five. So?

15:25.920 --> 15:27.680
OK.

15:27.720 --> 15:31.640
So Bill Clinton is trying to get re-elected
and his campaign is spending a lot.

15:31.680 --> 15:36.600
Later, it turns out that a ton of it is illegal
contributions from donations back in China,

15:36.640 --> 15:40.160
filtered in through stores
and restaurants and Buddhist nuns!

15:40.200 --> 15:44.520
I mean, forget about blowjobs from an intern,
that's what he should've been impeached for!

15:44.560 --> 15:47.600
Yeah, but he wasn't. - Sure,
because they returned the cheques.

15:47.640 --> 15:51.280
But there were 120 people involved who
either fled the country or plead the Fifth.

15:51.320 --> 15:54.760
There were 22 people who pleaded
guilty to violating election law.

15:54.800 --> 15:58.440
Somehow, Maria Dubecki managed to make
everybody forget she was even there!

15:58.480 --> 16:00.880
Do you think this is the best time
to bring this up?

16:00.920 --> 16:03.920
I feel like Hillary
has enough on her plate already.

16:03.960 --> 16:06.480
Yeah, no. That's fine. I mean,

16:06.520 --> 16:11.280
we were in the middle
of a conversation, but whatever.

16:12.560 --> 16:15.600
Hey, Zhang Lin. What do you know
about Tang Wen Lei?

16:15.640 --> 16:17.360
He's a very rich and powerful man.

16:17.400 --> 16:21.720
But you don't get that rich in China
without every yen being washed in blood.

16:21.760 --> 16:25.040
"Anyway, I don't have time for this
right now."

16:26.080 --> 16:27.580
Joy's been detained.

16:29.320 --> 16:33.240
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
That's awful.

16:33.280 --> 16:35.580
- What are you doing about it?
- I don't even know where she is.

16:35.581 --> 16:37.280
I haven't heard anything for days.

16:37.320 --> 16:39.700
You've got to get it in the newspapers.

16:39.701 --> 16:42.080
The Hong Kong titles will print it even
if the mainland ones won't right?

16:42.120 --> 16:44.820
She's a mom, get pictures of her kid.
Make sure they're cute.

16:44.821 --> 16:46.960
She's a wife and mother,
blah, blah, blah...

16:47.000 --> 16:49.320
Sir, could you please step this way?

16:50.400 --> 16:52.320
Zhang Lin, I gotta call you back.

16:52.360 --> 16:54.440
Take your laptop out of the bag,
sir.

16:54.480 --> 16:58.840
Do you have a warrant? We don't need a warrant, sir.
This is an issue of Homeland Security.

16:58.880 --> 17:03.400
If you could open up your computer,
we'll try not to inconvenience you too much today.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.079
Sir...

18:25.400 --> 18:27.800
- Did Senator Dubecki have you do this?
- You're free to go, sir.

18:27.840 --> 18:30.520
I'll be speaking to a lawyer
about this.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.240
I'm going to report you to the ACLU.
You can't do this.

18:34.280 --> 18:38.080
"It's the year 2016!

18:38.120 --> 18:42.360
"Women are still making
79 cents on the dollar

18:42.400 --> 18:45.120
"compared to men.

18:45.160 --> 18:49.160
"And I know that every man in here

18:49.200 --> 18:52.480
"will stand for Senator Clinton..."

18:52.520 --> 18:56.440
Hey. Should've been him, right?

18:56.480 --> 18:59.880
- I left my pass inside. Can I get back in?
- Sorry, man. We're on enhanced security.

18:59.920 --> 19:03.320
Oh, come on.
Do I look like a terrorist?

19:03.360 --> 19:05.120
In an Al-Qaeda way? No.

19:05.160 --> 19:10.440
But, like, in a Timothy McVeigh
guy-who-got-bullied-in-high-school way?

19:10.480 --> 19:12.520
Sure, I could see that.

19:22.960 --> 19:24.560
Alex?

19:24.600 --> 19:25.760
Oh, hi.

19:25.800 --> 19:28.080
Hey.

19:28.120 --> 19:32.480
- Where's your crew?
- Have you deleted Twitter or something?

19:32.520 --> 19:33.800
I got fired.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.360
Oh, shit. I'm sorry. What happened?

19:36.400 --> 19:39.800
I wrote this thing on trans people
using women's bathrooms,

19:39.840 --> 19:42.920
which... it pissed some people off.

19:42.960 --> 19:44.920
The left love to shit on their own.

19:44.960 --> 19:47.960
- But I guess you know that.
- Yeah!

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
Any chance you could use a wingman?
I need to speak to Senator Dubecki

19:51.040 --> 19:54.040
and I stupidly left my press pass
on the plane.

19:54.080 --> 19:55.920
Wow, that is really stupid!

19:55.960 --> 19:59.320
- I know! Can you believe it?
- Yeah, like,

19:59.360 --> 20:01.480
not at all.

20:01.520 --> 20:05.040
"So tell me this, North Carolina..."
- Yeah?

20:05.080 --> 20:06.600
"..tell me, North Carolina,

20:06.640 --> 20:12.520
"are you really, really happy
that we're here tonight?"

20:12.560 --> 20:15.640
So one last question. Alex, shoot.

20:15.680 --> 20:18.440
Senator? Senator?

20:18.480 --> 20:21.120
Senator?
No, I just have one question.

20:21.160 --> 20:24.600
- What have I done? What have I done?
- That's all we've got time for.

20:24.640 --> 20:27.960
- Ask her where Jimmy Wang is.
- Senator?

20:28.000 --> 20:31.240
Do you know where Jimmy Wang is?

20:31.280 --> 20:35.040
I'm sorry, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

20:35.080 --> 20:37.280
Excuse me.

20:37.320 --> 20:41.280
We're going to wrap things up
here. Thank you very much!

20:43.160 --> 20:45.920
- What happened?
- I don't know.

20:45.960 --> 20:50.040
She was spooked, though. Like,
"just saw the twin you thought you drowned" spooked.

20:50.080 --> 20:52.760
Want to tell me what this is about?

20:52.800 --> 20:55.080
Yeah. Not here.

20:57.480 --> 20:59.360
The Tank Man?

21:01.320 --> 21:03.680
Oh, my God, I thought he was dead!

21:04.760 --> 21:06.840
So, what are you gonna
do now? I mean...

21:06.841 --> 21:08.920
...if donations from the
flower shop implicate her in fraud,

21:08.960 --> 21:11.040
she's even less likely to help you.

21:11.080 --> 21:14.960
Probably, she's going to jail.
- You think? - Maybe.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.080
It's on the menu at least.

21:17.120 --> 21:21.000
I don't know.
She's the only lead I have right now.

21:22.720 --> 21:26.640
Hey, I-I wanted to say
that I'm glad that I ran into you.

21:26.680 --> 21:30.880
I'm sorry that I came down
to your office. I was...

21:30.920 --> 21:32.840
A giant asshole?

21:32.880 --> 21:35.240
Yeah.

21:38.040 --> 21:41.760
I thought maybe I could
buy you a beer?

21:41.800 --> 21:46.760
I wish I could, but I have to
drive up to Virginia tonight.

21:46.800 --> 21:48.560
I'm still registered there.

21:48.600 --> 21:52.280
Swing state. We're gonna
make it count. - Right on!

21:53.280 --> 21:55.560
- All right...
- All right!

21:55.600 --> 21:59.120
Hey! What do you think
was in his shopping bags?

21:59.160 --> 22:02.840
If I find out,
you'll be the first to know.

22:17.400 --> 22:20.080
"Is there any place

22:20.120 --> 22:24.640
"that's more fun to be
than a Trump rally?"

22:24.680 --> 22:27.520
So, are you gonna vote for him?

22:27.560 --> 22:30.800
I'm on probation.
I don't get a vote.

22:30.840 --> 22:33.360
That's why I know he's gonna win.

22:33.400 --> 22:36.120
They locked up half the folks
who would've voted for Hillary.

22:36.160 --> 22:39.760
You know who started all that,
don't you? Her damn husband.

22:39.800 --> 22:42.960
Mm. I hear ya.

22:56.400 --> 22:58.280
- Hello!
- "Hey."

22:58.320 --> 23:03.240
So the pen worked? - "No. The plane crashed.
I'm speaking to you from beyond the grave."

23:03.280 --> 23:05.000
David Bowie says hi.

23:05.040 --> 23:08.440
- So, did you miss me?
- Depends. Did you miss me?

23:08.480 --> 23:10.720
- Mm.
- Well, you seemed pretty fond of me

23:10.760 --> 23:13.760
when your arse was banging
against the toilet door of a 747.

23:13.761 --> 23:15.680
Hey, that was an act of charity!

23:15.720 --> 23:19.840
I've had more fun getting cavity-searched
at the Russian border than that.

23:22.480 --> 23:28.040
Hey, so you know Zhang Lin's friend
Joy, she got arrested.

23:28.080 --> 23:31.520
- What? Why didn't you tell me?
- "I'm telling you right now."

23:31.560 --> 23:33.720
It's not like you can do
anything about it.

23:33.760 --> 23:37.040
Why not? - Because you're over there
working for a credit card company.

23:37.080 --> 23:39.240
- So?
- So I don't know how much,

23:39.280 --> 23:41.760
like, moral leverage you have.

23:41.800 --> 23:45.760
What are you saying? I should quit my
job, join the Red Cross or something?

23:45.800 --> 23:49.440
Jesus! I'm not suggesting that
you start digging wells in Africa!

23:49.480 --> 23:53.240
Good, because I don't give a shit
about Africa. - That's nice, Tess.

23:53.280 --> 23:55.160
That was very nice.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.400
Just send me Zhang Lin's number.
"Sure."

23:57.440 --> 24:00.680
Obviously,
I do give a shit about Africa.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.720
I keep thinking
this isn't happening,

24:10.760 --> 24:16.040
I'm going to wake up any minute.
And then I don't.

24:16.080 --> 24:19.320
What about her phone?
Maybe there's a way of tracing it.

24:19.360 --> 24:21.760
I thought of that

24:21.800 --> 24:24.880
but, uh, it was in her handbag
when they left it.

24:30.080 --> 24:32.080
Are these both hers?

24:32.120 --> 24:33.640
She's from Hong Kong.

24:33.680 --> 24:37.040
Dual nationality
is very common there. So?

24:37.080 --> 24:41.040
If she's got British nationality,
they'll have to protect her.

24:41.080 --> 24:45.000
Her name is Joanna Geary. She's not the
ambassador but she's two down or something.

24:45.040 --> 24:46.840
Anyway, I think...
Ooh, shit, there she is!

24:46.880 --> 24:49.120
Miss Geary!

24:49.160 --> 24:50.920
Miss Geary! Sorry! Sorry, sorry!

24:50.960 --> 24:54.440
Erm, I'm Tess Kendrick.
I have an appointment with you.

24:54.480 --> 24:56.340
Sorry, I've been called away.
Come back next week.

24:56.341 --> 24:58.200
That's too late!
This is Mrs Joy Fu.

24:58.240 --> 25:02.360
They won't even release where she's being
held, but she has a BNO passport,

25:02.400 --> 25:06.440
which means she's entitled to protection,
and this is an illegal abduction.

25:06.480 --> 25:10.160
She has dual status? She hasn't
renounced her Chinese nationality?

25:10.200 --> 25:13.520
No. - Then, her passport
is simply a travel document.

25:13.560 --> 25:17.280
It's not recognised on the mainland
and Hong Kong belongs to China.

25:17.320 --> 25:19.080
We no longer rule it.

25:19.120 --> 25:22.200
No, we don't rule anything! We're
just a washed-up, grey little island

25:22.240 --> 25:26.080
with no power except for a very loud voice
which, for some reason, people still listen to.

25:26.120 --> 25:29.880
If you're going to let an innocent woman sit
in prison because you're afraid to use it,

25:29.920 --> 25:34.080
I suggest, respectfully, you consider
what the fuck the point of you is.

25:34.120 --> 25:36.640
Hm. Very rousing.

25:37.680 --> 25:40.000
Come back next week.

25:47.360 --> 25:48.960
I'm so sorry.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.080
- What are you going to do now?
- I don't know.

25:52.120 --> 25:53.760
I have to be careful.

25:53.800 --> 25:56.640
Someone has to look after
Ming Xiaoli.

26:18.480 --> 26:22.480
"The relatives and friends of missing
students visited makeshift morgues

26:22.520 --> 26:25.880
"attempting to identify loved ones
who have disappeared.

26:25.920 --> 26:30.560
"The army's attack on unarmed civilians
has not intimidated these people,

26:30.600 --> 26:32.320
"it has angered them.

26:32.360 --> 26:37.280
"The people on the streets do not speak of
retreat, they talk about revenge."

26:48.920 --> 26:50.800
Ming Ma.

26:56.360 --> 26:58.360
Ming Ma.

27:25.520 --> 27:28.920
Let's get out and vote,
Philadelphia, tomorrow!

27:28.960 --> 27:33.240
Let's make history together!
Thank you and God bless you!

27:33.280 --> 27:35.840
- Who had the rigatoni?
- Here!

27:35.880 --> 27:37.800
- Another bottle of the Barolo?
- Can I get another Coke?

27:37.801 --> 27:39.720
- Do you want a coke?
- Love one. - Make that two.

27:39.760 --> 27:44.680
Karen saw the Florida polls. It's going to be a
landslide for Clinton among swing Hispanic voters.

27:44.720 --> 27:48.160
Trump's down in eight battleground
states by five to eight points. - Says who?

27:48.200 --> 27:51.720
Uh, the AP, CNN, NBC, ABC,
ABC Fox News!

27:53.160 --> 27:55.720
Put your eyes back in your heads,
I invited him.

27:55.760 --> 27:59.360
- Sit down.
- Don't worry, I'm not staying.

27:59.400 --> 28:02.160
- Can I grab you for a second?
- Did you vote?

28:02.200 --> 28:06.280
Vote? No. You know I'm not voting.
Who am I gonna vote for?

28:06.320 --> 28:08.840
Clinton. You vote for Clinton.

28:08.880 --> 28:10.680
The lady with the drones?
I don't think so.

28:10.720 --> 28:13.640
Oh, come on, Frank! No way New York
isn't going for Hillary.

28:13.680 --> 28:17.120
If he wants to make a protest,
so what?

28:17.160 --> 28:19.640
Do you think you're owed
some sort of bespoke candidate?

28:19.680 --> 28:22.440
Some artisanally-crafted,
hand-picked,

28:22.441 --> 28:25.200
personalised avatar who doesn't
offend you in any way?

28:25.240 --> 28:28.360
This isn't a fucking salad bar, Lee.

28:28.361 --> 28:31.480
It's the most insane election
in the history of this country

28:31.520 --> 28:35.040
and you don't get to ask them to hold
the kale and give you extra tomatoes,

28:35.080 --> 28:36.480
you just take the thing

28:36.520 --> 28:39.480
that's not a giant shit
in a plastic box!

28:39.520 --> 28:41.640
I would've voted for Bernie.
That's great!

28:41.680 --> 28:43.000
Hey, that's really great!

28:43.040 --> 28:45.760
Only he's not the fucking candidate!

28:45.800 --> 28:49.160
Sure, because you've been calling him
unelectable from the start.

28:49.200 --> 28:53.320
I didn't vote because a vote is a mark
of trust and I don't trust any of them!

28:53.360 --> 28:57.120
You really wanna talk about trust
right now,

28:57.160 --> 28:59.400
after what you did?

28:59.440 --> 29:01.600
I know what I did
and I'm ashamed of myself.

29:01.640 --> 29:06.520
But they're not. They're shameless and we know it,
and every four years we still vote in a new one.

29:06.560 --> 29:10.960
Welcome to democracy! It's slightly less
fucked-up than all the other options.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.400
- I need to talk to you now!
- Yeah.

29:13.440 --> 29:17.320
Let's go sit on the quiet step
for a minute.

29:18.280 --> 29:21.360
So Pennsylvania, that's gonna
be tight, right? - Oh, Hillary for sure.

29:27.760 --> 29:30.440
What the fuck is in your Kool-Aid?

29:30.480 --> 29:33.160
Do you have a personal number
for Maria Dubecki?

29:33.200 --> 29:36.480
Why? What's going on? - Remember the
Clinton campaign scandal in '96?

29:36.520 --> 29:39.040
Millions of illegal
Chinese donations at DNC?

29:39.080 --> 29:40.360
Vaguely.

29:40.400 --> 29:44.640
Exactly. No-one does because we give the
Clintons the kind of pass we never give Trump!

29:44.680 --> 29:47.680
And when it all came out we were more
interested in Princess Diana's drunk chauffeur.

29:47.690 --> 29:49.600
My God, what are you saying,

29:49.640 --> 29:52.120
the Chinese killed Di?
Those bastards!

29:52.160 --> 29:53.680
Don't do that.

29:53.720 --> 29:56.680
I pulled clips from the fundraiser
at the Hsi Lai temple in '96

29:56.720 --> 29:59.960
where Al Gore accepted cheques
for $100,000.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.360
That's Senator Dubecki,
back when she was Maria Meng.

30:02.400 --> 30:06.160
She was there, and I think
she took an illegal donation

30:06.200 --> 30:08.880
from the owner of the
Glorious City Flower Shop,

30:08.920 --> 30:11.400
and Wang Pengfei, or Jimmy Wang,
or whatever the fuck his name is,

30:11.401 --> 30:13.880
he was working there at the time.

30:13.920 --> 30:17.880
So, she thought that you were after her when
we just wanted to know about Wang Pengfei?

30:17.920 --> 30:19.600
- Exactly.
- Shit!

30:19.640 --> 30:21.720
If this gets out...

30:21.760 --> 30:26.520
You know that she's been leading the Clean
Finance Coalition the last three years? - Yes!

30:26.560 --> 30:29.920
If I could just reassure her...
Or if you could call her...

30:29.960 --> 30:31.640
You call her, that's better,

30:31.680 --> 30:34.160
and tell her that we think we know
who he is.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.880
Lee, it is fucking Election Day!
I'm not gonna do that!

30:36.920 --> 30:39.880
Please, Mel!
She called the fucking TSA on me!

30:39.920 --> 30:42.480
I tried her office ten times,
she won't talk to me.

30:42.520 --> 30:45.120
- Of course she won't!
- Right, because she's scared! - No!

30:45.160 --> 30:49.720
She won't talk to you, Lee, because
you are not a journalist any more.

30:49.760 --> 30:52.160
You will never be
a journalist again.

30:52.200 --> 30:54.160
And, baby,
until you start accepting that,

30:54.200 --> 30:57.160
you are going to go fucking nuts!

30:57.200 --> 30:58.960
I need that number.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.320
Why?

31:00.360 --> 31:04.800
So some guy who took a great photo
27 years ago can complete his...

31:04.840 --> 31:08.480
...difficult second album?

31:08.520 --> 31:11.480
You think you helped make
the Tank Man?

31:11.520 --> 31:13.360
That's bullshit!

31:13.400 --> 31:16.160
Point and click, that's all you did.

31:16.200 --> 31:21.040
And now you want to recycle an old
photograph and turn it into a crusade?

31:21.080 --> 31:23.200
It's not a crusade, Lee!

31:23.240 --> 31:26.240
It's desperate masturbation!

31:30.560 --> 31:33.080
I am so sorry.

31:35.960 --> 31:39.320
Look, why don't you
come stay with us for a while?

31:39.360 --> 31:41.320
You can stay...

33:25.120 --> 33:27.880
"Polls just closed
in 14 more states."

33:27.920 --> 33:31.600
..including two huge ones,
Texas and New York.

33:31.640 --> 33:35.840
"The states we are watching at nine
eastern - it's a long list. Get ready.

33:35.880 --> 33:39.160
"Michigan, too close to call.

33:39.200 --> 33:43.160
"Arizona, too early to call.

33:43.200 --> 33:46.760
"Colorado, too early to call."

33:46.800 --> 33:49.360
Sounds good. I'll talk to you later.

33:51.400 --> 33:54.200
- Can I help you?
- Excuse me?

33:54.240 --> 33:56.080
I said, can I help you?

33:56.120 --> 34:00.200
What are you doing here? I wanna know
what you're doing here! Hey! Hey!

34:00.240 --> 34:03.440
You tell Dubecki she can't do this!
I'm not scared of you!

34:03.480 --> 34:05.880
Who are you working for?

34:05.920 --> 34:08.040
Get out of the car!

34:08.080 --> 34:11.040
Calm down! - She's watching
my fucking apartment! Get off of me!

34:11.080 --> 34:14.560
Get the fuck away from me!

34:43.020 --> 34:46.699
"..too early to call."

34:46.739 --> 34:50.219
"Texas has been awarded
to Donald Trump.

34:50.260 --> 34:51.540
"Texas stays red.

34:51.580 --> 34:56.300
"As does Kansas. No wobble there."

34:56.340 --> 34:58.940
"Sportsman Paradise, Louisiana -

South Dakota - Trump"

"Listen, I don't trust you..."

35:26.500 --> 35:27.580
Hello, Lee.

35:27.620 --> 35:31.500
But I don't have any other options
right now, so I...

35:32.860 --> 35:34.860
"I need you your help.

35:34.900 --> 35:37.300
"Can you get me
Senator Dubecki's number?"

35:37.340 --> 35:40.180
"You'll need to give me his name."

35:42.300 --> 35:45.060
His name's Wang Pengfei.

35:46.100 --> 35:50.420
Thank you, Lee. I will call you in one
hour with the information you need.

35:52.900 --> 35:57.180
"..in terms of battlegrounds,
Florida, too close.

35:57.220 --> 36:00.860
"Ohio, too close to call.

"Georgia,
one of the early closes..."

36:03.300 --> 36:08.180
"You'll need to give me his name."
"His name's Wang Pengfei."

36:22.940 --> 36:26.380
"We use political hacks
to make deals with China

36:26.420 --> 36:31.220
"and then we lose almost
$500 billion a year with China

36:31.260 --> 36:34.660
"and we want to know
what's wrong with us."

36:41.940 --> 36:45.620
"They use their smartest, toughest,
meanest people."

36:45.660 --> 36:50.100
- It's OK. It's OK.
- "We use dumb people. We use hacks."

36:51.660 --> 36:54.340
"I've done a lot of business
with China.

36:54.380 --> 36:58.420
"I think China's great.
I've made a lot of money with China.

"I have the biggest banker in the
world from China as my tenant.

"I sell condos, I have the Bank
America Building in San Francisco,

"another big building in Manhattan

37:09.660 --> 37:11.100
"I mean, China's great."

37:14.980 --> 37:18.820
I'm wondering what kind of country
we're coming home to.

37:18.860 --> 37:20.540
Well, he's not going to win.

37:20.580 --> 37:23.860
I mean, I was working
for this company back in the UK

37:23.900 --> 37:28.780
and they have about 4 to 5,000 pieces of
information on every voter in the country,

37:28.820 --> 37:32.740
and they were only giving him
a 20 percent chance, so...

37:32.780 --> 37:36.500
And where are they getting this
information? - You don't want to know.

37:36.540 --> 37:40.420
Actually, you already know, you just
don't want to know you know.

37:40.460 --> 37:45.260
"Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has
turned on the 'Fasten Seat Belt' sign.

37:45.300 --> 37:48.460
"Please take your seat

37:53.580 --> 37:58.660
CNN can report that Hillary Clinton
has called Donald Trump

37:58.700 --> 38:00.140
to concede the race.

38:00.180 --> 38:02.260
"She has called Donald Trump to say

38:02.300 --> 38:05.780
"that she will not be president and
I'm not sure of the exact words,

38:05.820 --> 38:08.820
but probably to congratulate the
President-elect Donald Trump" - Lee?

38:08.830 --> 38:13.060
Are you there?

38:13.100 --> 38:15.380
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

38:15.420 --> 38:19.500
Oh, you fucking idiots!

38:19.540 --> 38:21.940
Did you completely ignore Brexit?

38:21.980 --> 38:26.460
I mean, what part of Britain having a nervous
fucking breakdown did you not underst...

38:26.500 --> 38:28.260
Oh, God!

38:28.300 --> 38:31.260
What... What's happened?

38:31.300 --> 38:33.860
Let me see your sweetheart...

38:34.860 --> 38:37.380
OK, I need to clean that up.

38:37.420 --> 38:39.620
Sit down. Sit down.

38:42.100 --> 38:43.380
"So, uh, Hillary..."

38:43.420 --> 38:46.500
"Donald Trump
is now the President-elect."

38:46.540 --> 38:48.540
"Jubilant at Trump campaign
headquarters."

38:48.580 --> 38:51.780
"Just like her campaign aides,
it was very difficult for Hillary..." - No.

38:51.820 --> 38:56.860
"It is my high honour
and distinct privilege

38:56.900 --> 38:59.340
"to introduce to you

38:59.380 --> 39:03.460
"the President-elect
of the United States of America,

39:03.500 --> 39:05.060
"Donald Trump."

39:39.220 --> 39:41.300
What's going on?
Where the fuck are you?

39:41.340 --> 39:43.380
"Do you have Dubecki's number?"

39:43.420 --> 39:47.820
Things are very bad for me, Lee.
There's a price to pay for telling the truth.

39:47.860 --> 39:51.220
They're sending me back.
I had to cooperate.

39:51.260 --> 39:53.620
"It's my only hope."

39:53.660 --> 39:56.380
Did you give Wang Pengfei's name
to the Party?

39:56.420 --> 39:58.660
I had no choice.

39:58.700 --> 40:01.100
No, no! You had a choice!

40:01.140 --> 40:03.780
This is a man's life
we're talking about.

40:03.820 --> 40:05.500
This is a man's life
we're talking about!

40:05.540 --> 40:08.100
Lee, you have to find him
before they do.

40:08.140 --> 40:09.940
Is he in danger?

40:09.980 --> 40:12.540
"Mr Tang, is Wang Pengfei in danger?"

40:20.900 --> 40:22.940
Hey, hey!

40:22.980 --> 40:25.020
What the fuck's going on?

40:25.060 --> 40:27.060
Sorry. What's happening?

40:33.060 --> 40:35.860
"Now it's time for America..."

40:35.900 --> 40:38.860
Lee, are you all right?

40:39.900 --> 40:42.900
No, I'm fine. I just...
Something came up.

40:42.940 --> 40:44.860
Can I borrow your phone?

40:44.900 --> 40:47.780
What?
I just need to borrow your phone.

40:47.820 --> 40:49.180
OK.

40:49.220 --> 40:50.780
Let's see.

40:50.820 --> 40:53.140
What's the passcode? It's 2016.

40:53.180 --> 40:55.940
Yeah, I know, I know, it's...

40:55.980 --> 41:00.860
I just have to run over and babysit
for Nathan for a little bit.

41:00.900 --> 41:04.540
"I pledge to every citizen
of our land

41:04.580 --> 41:07.300
"that I will be president
for all Americans..."

41:07.340 --> 41:10.300
- I'll be back.
- "..and this is so important to me."

41:21.820 --> 41:23.060
Hey.

41:30.820 --> 41:32.780
Hey...

42:05.100 --> 42:06.900
Hey!

42:54.380 --> 42:55.580
"Hello. Who is this?"

42:55.620 --> 42:58.660
Sorry, Senator.
I thought she had it in the bag.

42:58.700 --> 43:01.260
How did you get this number?

43:02.260 --> 43:04.900
I need to know where he is.

43:04.940 --> 43:07.380
Are you serious? Now?

43:07.420 --> 43:12.140
Do you have any idea what we're waking
up to tomorrow? I mean, do you get that?

43:12.180 --> 43:16.060
OK, so I didn't want to do this,
but...

43:17.500 --> 43:20.060
..but, OK, I have these files...

43:20.100 --> 43:23.260
Could you see if you could find me
a power bar or something?

43:23.300 --> 43:26.100
I skipped dinner.
Thank you so much.

43:27.660 --> 43:29.820
No! Stay where you are!

43:30.820 --> 43:33.740
What files?

43:33.780 --> 43:36.300
The Hsi Lai Temple, 1996.

43:36.340 --> 43:40.940
Your hair was longer and there was a cheque from
the Glorious City Flower Shop in your purse.

43:40.980 --> 43:43.060
Come on!

43:43.100 --> 43:44.900
Trump's probably in bed with Russia

43:44.940 --> 43:48.540
and you expect anyone to give a shit over
an accounting error from 20 years ago?

43:48.580 --> 43:50.900
"It wasn't an accounting error."

43:50.940 --> 43:52.620
It was fraud.

43:52.660 --> 43:54.820
On a massive scale.

43:54.860 --> 43:59.140
What I'm concerned about is that
people remember those kinda pictures.

43:59.180 --> 44:00.980
"Bullshit."

44:01.020 --> 44:04.220
Al Gore was all over Hsi Lai,
it didn't hurt his career any.

44:04.260 --> 44:06.660
Sure but you get
what happened tonight, right?

44:06.700 --> 44:08.680
You're a rich white guy,
you can lie, you can cheat,

44:08.681 --> 44:10.660
you can grab pussy, we'll still
trust you with the White House,

44:10.700 --> 44:12.340
but you're a middle-aged women,

44:12.380 --> 44:16.460
you put your emails in the wrong
folder, we'll fucking execute you.

44:16.500 --> 44:19.900
Al Gore's daddy was a senator,
your daddy sold cheap ceramics.

44:19.940 --> 44:22.140
"Worst of all, you're not even white.

44:22.180 --> 44:26.020
So the way I look at it, you're gambling on
the American public being real enlightened

44:26.060 --> 44:31.020
on a night we just got proof we're
living in the Dark Ages, so you know...

44:32.020 --> 44:34.420
...it's your funeral.

44:35.420 --> 44:38.100
There's a storm coming, Lee.

44:39.500 --> 44:43.100
I hope it picks you up
and drops you in the fucking Hudson.

44:44.140 --> 44:46.340
I need to hear from you by tomorrow.

44:48.020 --> 44:51.260
I know you won't believe me but...

44:51.300 --> 44:53.620
...I'm really sorry about this.

45:44.380 --> 45:47.540
Lock her up!

45:47.580 --> 45:49.700
- Loser!
- Thank you.

45:49.740 --> 45:54.020
That's how democracy works.
That's how, uh,

45:54.060 --> 45:55.780
this system operates.
