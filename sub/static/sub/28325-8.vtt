WEBVTT

00:08.516 --> 00:10.860
Things are getting worse in
America, friends.

00:10.968 --> 00:12.485
Even in my old home of baseball,

00:12.637 --> 00:16.062
the infidels are invading
the holy land, y'all.

00:16.216 --> 00:18.124
Jim Brockmire, paid by George Soros

00:18.161 --> 00:20.726
in the deep-state
conspiracy to frame me,

00:21.116 --> 00:22.987
he's out there calling games.

00:23.032 --> 00:25.032
And who is he doing it with?

00:25.083 --> 00:26.249
I'll tell you.

00:26.326 --> 00:28.523
A black homosexual woman

00:28.560 --> 00:31.563
who's never even played real baseball.

00:31.600 --> 00:33.616
Meanwhile, my statue in Atlanta

00:33.653 --> 00:36.525
gets taken down in the
middle of the night.

00:36.584 --> 00:39.594
It's enough to make you want
to despair for the future.

00:39.656 --> 00:43.324
But, all right, it's opening day,

00:43.400 --> 00:45.233
the time where hope springs eternal.

00:45.270 --> 00:46.454
I get it.

00:46.679 --> 00:49.015
But if y'all are as unhappy as I am,

00:49.087 --> 00:51.524
then I urge you to
show up to games today

00:51.676 --> 00:54.844
and let the powers that be
know we won't back down.

00:54.921 --> 00:56.321
<i>We will keep baseball pure.</i>

00:56.358 --> 01:00.861
<i>And after that, America.
By any means necessary.</i>

01:01.280 --> 01:02.629
<i>- Friends.</i>
- Come on.

01:02.701 --> 01:04.059
[HONKS HORN]

01:04.209 --> 01:07.256
Your need for attention
is not my problem, Randy.

01:07.293 --> 01:08.759
Okay? Let's go.

01:08.831 --> 01:10.058
You're not supposed

01:10.095 --> 01:11.180
- to honk your horn, Mom.
- I'm not allowing

01:11.216 --> 01:12.736
- You've been warned.
- my day to get hijacked,

01:12.772 --> 01:13.954
and this is my only form of protest.

01:13.991 --> 01:16.501
- [HONKS HORN]
- Can we move it along?

01:17.411 --> 01:19.002
[SIGHS] What are you watching?

01:19.096 --> 01:20.942
- Art Newlie.
- What?

01:21.013 --> 01:22.213
He's taking down the hypocrisy

01:22.250 --> 01:23.560
of the mainstream media.

01:24.280 --> 01:26.094
Define hypocrisy.

01:26.374 --> 01:28.116
- Exactly.
- What?

01:28.268 --> 01:29.951
I don't want you watching...

01:30.217 --> 01:31.992
Kyle, what's on your face?

01:32.980 --> 01:34.994
Are you eating my donuts?

01:35.423 --> 01:36.973
[GROANING]

01:37.285 --> 01:39.961
Those were for A.A., Kyle!

01:40.262 --> 01:42.081
Damn. Okay.

01:42.334 --> 01:43.599
Listen to Mommy.

01:43.775 --> 01:47.350
Mommy gets them addicted
to sugar and caffeine

01:47.387 --> 01:49.016
instead of drugs and alcohol.

01:49.122 --> 01:51.054
Right? That's how I help them.

01:51.091 --> 01:53.400
So I need the donuts,
otherwise they don't come.

01:53.437 --> 01:54.648
And if they don't come,

01:54.685 --> 01:56.875
then they wrap their cars
around telephone poles.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.261
You understand what I mean?

01:58.373 --> 01:59.949
You see... Shit. Shit, shit!

01:59.986 --> 02:01.610
Get a bag, baby.
Get a bag. Baby, get a...

02:01.693 --> 02:03.773
- No!
- [BOY RETCHES]

02:03.844 --> 02:05.447
[BOTH GROANING]

02:05.571 --> 02:06.876
All right, yep.

02:06.978 --> 02:09.121
Mommy's purse is a bag.

02:09.811 --> 02:12.094
Very good listening, honey.

02:12.612 --> 02:14.587
I'm real proud of you.

02:17.851 --> 02:20.378
- [HONKS HORN]
- Move your ass!

02:20.469 --> 02:22.262
Oh, my god.

02:24.391 --> 02:26.075
<i>My afternoon's free</i>

02:26.112 --> 02:28.485
if you want to try for round three.

02:28.889 --> 02:31.302
I think you mean round two, don't you?

02:31.458 --> 02:34.293
You don't remember that time
in the middle of the night?

02:34.392 --> 02:36.865
- No... oh, no. I'm a sleep fucker.
- [LAUGHS]

02:36.902 --> 02:38.684
No, I do some of my best dick work

02:38.721 --> 02:39.926
in a dream state.

02:39.963 --> 02:41.222
- Huh.
- [LAUGHS]

02:41.365 --> 02:43.598
I just thought you
were doing very specific

02:43.635 --> 02:45.173
tugboat role play.

02:45.261 --> 02:46.519
No, that'd be weird.

02:46.556 --> 02:48.896
Yeah. I'll see you after the game.

02:48.938 --> 02:49.988
Good luck in Tampa.

02:50.024 --> 02:51.525
You guys are going to kill it.

02:52.567 --> 02:53.694
Bye, Gabs!

02:53.776 --> 02:55.399
Bye, Sauce Bitch!

02:56.910 --> 02:59.749
Well, I have not
felt this good since...

03:00.049 --> 03:01.240
ever.

03:01.285 --> 03:03.771
I'm finally in a healthy
adult relationship.

03:03.808 --> 03:04.740
It's opening day.

03:04.777 --> 03:06.509
God it's my favorite day of the year.

03:06.518 --> 03:08.907
And my nightmare about
ramming a tugboat

03:08.944 --> 03:10.068
into the Panama Canal

03:10.105 --> 03:11.681
finally makes a whole lot more sense.

03:11.718 --> 03:14.072
I mean, everything is coming
up Brockmire over here.

03:14.149 --> 03:16.952
- [DOORBELL RINGS]
- Oh, hold that thought.

03:17.104 --> 03:19.240
Maggie probably forgot something.

03:19.747 --> 03:20.946
Hey...

03:21.052 --> 03:22.501
Jean.

03:22.553 --> 03:24.597
You come back... you
came back to forgive me?

03:24.634 --> 03:27.515
My goodness,
and on my first day back in the bigs.

03:27.552 --> 03:29.790
And I thought this day
couldn't get any better!

03:29.827 --> 03:32.392
Yeah, well, it's about to
get a hell of a lot worse.

03:32.494 --> 03:33.655
I haven't forgiven you.

03:33.692 --> 03:35.530
And I couldn't give a
shit about your comeback.

03:35.608 --> 03:37.691
Gabby reached out and
asked me to come down.

03:37.728 --> 03:39.046
Tomorrow I asked you to come,

03:39.083 --> 03:41.432
because I said today was
a very big day for both of us.

03:41.469 --> 03:43.281
Yeah, but tomorrow's not good for me.

03:43.318 --> 03:45.338
It's grad night at Disney World,

03:45.397 --> 03:46.889
and I would rather not be surrounded

03:46.926 --> 03:48.993
by a bunch of teenagers
fingering each other

03:49.030 --> 03:50.701
on Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.

03:50.738 --> 03:52.747
Bad news is, I have to go by myself.

03:52.784 --> 03:54.293
Sam couldn't get the time off work,

03:54.330 --> 03:55.680
and Norm won't go back

03:55.717 --> 03:57.670
because he was traumatized
at the Haunted Mansion

03:57.707 --> 04:00.897
on account of his sensitivity
to the paranormal.

04:00.934 --> 04:02.565
What the hell are you talking about?

04:02.602 --> 04:04.398
- What is going on?
- All right.

04:04.435 --> 04:05.784
I guess we're doing this now.

04:05.868 --> 04:07.205
Uh, Jim,

04:07.242 --> 04:08.841
there's something
that you need to hear.

04:08.878 --> 04:11.597
And I thought having Jean
here would soften the blow.

04:11.745 --> 04:13.202
Did Mom die?

04:13.291 --> 04:14.941
Oh, no, are you dying?

04:14.978 --> 04:16.493
Oh, shit. I'm dying.

04:16.529 --> 04:18.142
No, dumbass.

04:18.180 --> 04:20.314
Jules is engaged.

04:20.476 --> 04:22.171
- What?
- Yeah, she, uh,

04:22.208 --> 04:24.254
made it Instagram official yesterday.

04:24.364 --> 04:25.766
Oh, my god.

04:25.803 --> 04:27.170
How did you see this?

04:27.207 --> 04:28.573
I follow her.

04:28.648 --> 04:29.868
At first I was just curious

04:29.905 --> 04:31.305
'cause you were always
going on about her,

04:31.341 --> 04:32.938
but now I really like what she does.

04:32.975 --> 04:35.506
Right? She's like the
Busy Phillips of baseball.

04:35.543 --> 04:37.893
Jules and George Brett
are getting married.

04:37.930 --> 04:39.246
My goodness.

04:39.652 --> 04:40.739
Well,

04:40.776 --> 04:42.851
Jean, I know you don't forgive me, but

04:42.888 --> 04:44.900
flying all the way here
to help break this news...

04:44.937 --> 04:46.419
that, uh, that means a lot.

04:46.456 --> 04:47.637
I'm still mad at you,

04:47.674 --> 04:49.905
but your sobriety is important to me.

04:49.959 --> 04:51.975
Every time your shit hits the fan,

04:52.036 --> 04:53.279
you get on a mic,

04:53.316 --> 04:55.155
fling it back out at the rest of us,

04:55.192 --> 04:56.334
and go on a bender.

04:56.382 --> 04:57.578
I don't want that to happen.

04:57.615 --> 05:00.145
So please, don't do anything crazy.

05:01.349 --> 05:04.697
Well, would you looky here?

05:04.983 --> 05:08.502
It's the weird spot
where we first kissed;

05:08.617 --> 05:12.520
where it all began for both of us.

05:13.174 --> 05:14.916
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

05:14.953 --> 05:16.033
Get your hand out of your pocket.

05:16.069 --> 05:17.396
Put your hands where I can see 'em!

05:17.433 --> 05:19.041
Maggie, I realize it's not fair

05:19.078 --> 05:20.739
to ask you to move to Oakland

05:20.889 --> 05:22.963
without some kind of a commitment.

05:23.033 --> 05:25.516
Move to Oakland?

05:25.710 --> 05:27.183
[LAUGHING] Jim...

05:27.309 --> 05:29.171
You literally know nothing about me

05:29.208 --> 05:31.558
except for what my vagina tastes like.

05:31.595 --> 05:33.122
Well, at this point in your cycle

05:33.159 --> 05:34.540
with the Moon waning like it is,

05:34.577 --> 05:35.697
- it tastes...
- No, no, no, no, no.

05:35.734 --> 05:36.702
I don't actually want to know.

05:36.739 --> 05:38.794
No, that would make me self-conscious.

05:38.831 --> 05:40.032
Well, it shouldn't,

05:40.103 --> 05:44.047
because I want to taste it
for the rest of my life.

05:44.144 --> 05:45.782
Jeez Louise!

05:45.839 --> 05:48.159
That is much bigger than I expected.

05:48.216 --> 05:50.272
Yeah, it turns out not
having a cocaine problem

05:50.317 --> 05:52.091
is just a great way to save money.

05:52.309 --> 05:53.829
Maggie, I know I know we haven't

05:53.866 --> 05:55.524
known each other long, but...

05:55.605 --> 05:58.653
I feel that what we
have is just so special.

06:00.198 --> 06:01.933
What's my middle name?

06:02.234 --> 06:04.042
Now, that is a stumper,

06:04.157 --> 06:06.580
considering I don't even
know your last name.

06:07.325 --> 06:09.228
- What is your last name?
- [SIGHS]

06:09.322 --> 06:10.895
Okay.

06:11.456 --> 06:13.936
- You can get up.
- Oh, really?

06:13.981 --> 06:15.117
- Yeah.
- Okay.

06:15.154 --> 06:16.482
I know why you're doing this.

06:16.519 --> 06:19.106
- I follow Jules on Instagram.
- No, no, no, no, no.

06:19.143 --> 06:20.809
At first,
it was just some light stalking

06:20.846 --> 06:23.311
to convince myself that
she was terrible, but...

06:23.759 --> 06:26.204
then it just made me feel
better that I was with someone

06:26.241 --> 06:27.849
who dated someone that cool.

06:27.892 --> 06:30.414
Well, is she... why is she cool?
Seriously?

06:30.451 --> 06:32.246
Because she's engaged
to a baseball legend

06:32.283 --> 06:34.474
and she travels around the country

06:34.511 --> 06:35.862
putting on special events at.

06:35.899 --> 06:37.415
Well, actually,
I can see why this is all

06:37.452 --> 06:39.730
pretty good on Instagram. I can.

06:40.031 --> 06:43.003
I've had a really good
time, but that's all this is.

06:43.040 --> 06:44.383
I don't want anything more.

06:44.420 --> 06:45.795
I'm actually leaving Florida,

06:45.832 --> 06:47.120
- in a little while.
- What?

06:47.157 --> 06:48.463
Yeah, Matt the Bat left me all

06:48.500 --> 06:50.204
of his frequent flyer
miles when he died.

06:50.241 --> 06:52.555
We used to talk about how I
really wanted to go to Japan.

06:52.592 --> 06:54.854
So I'm flying there
in a couple of weeks.

06:54.891 --> 06:56.908
And then from there, who knows?

06:57.535 --> 06:59.535
He left you his miles?

06:59.701 --> 07:01.888
All I got was to hold
his hand when he died

07:01.925 --> 07:03.918
and some expired Dunkaroos.

07:04.284 --> 07:06.553
I'm sorry, it was not my plan to do this

07:06.594 --> 07:07.842
before your first game back.

07:07.879 --> 07:10.025
- Are you going to be okay?
- Yeah. Sure.

07:10.062 --> 07:11.636
Oh, God damn it.

07:11.870 --> 07:12.989
Sorry.

07:13.026 --> 07:14.133
I just realized we have to pedal

07:14.170 --> 07:15.584
all the way back to the rental shop

07:15.621 --> 07:17.254
against the wind, so...

07:17.542 --> 07:19.651
This is about to be
the most awkward 20 minutes

07:19.688 --> 07:21.947
that I've ever sweated my way through.

07:21.984 --> 07:23.246
How about you?

07:23.452 --> 07:25.403
- Yeah, it's up there.
- Yeah, right?

07:25.440 --> 07:26.734
Yeah.

07:26.819 --> 07:28.411
[GRUNTING] Oh, boy.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.848
- That actually hurts.
- So tough.

Hey, beta cuck!

07:42.704 --> 07:44.578
That's alpha cuck to you.

07:44.704 --> 07:46.011
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

07:46.048 --> 07:47.122
Almost constantly...

07:47.159 --> 07:48.633
- Who are you guys?
- We're the protest.

07:48.670 --> 07:51.148
- What are you protesting?
- Your existence.

07:51.185 --> 07:52.854
CROWD: Everything old is Newlie again!

07:52.891 --> 07:54.534
Everything old is Newlie again!

07:54.571 --> 07:56.278
Everything old is Newlie again!

07:56.315 --> 07:57.940
Everything old is Newlie again!

07:57.977 --> 08:00.183
Well, I was just accosted by

08:00.220 --> 08:02.371
the Hitler Youth
lacrosse team out there.

08:02.408 --> 08:03.691
What is happening?

08:03.728 --> 08:05.468
Art Newlie has declared war on us

08:05.505 --> 08:06.646
and baseball.

08:06.770 --> 08:08.070
- What?
- Where have you been?

08:08.107 --> 08:10.226
Even for Florida that's
a lot of loose sweat.

08:10.308 --> 08:12.821
In a moment of panic,
I proposed to Maggie.

08:12.910 --> 08:15.143
At which point she
promptly broke up with me

08:15.185 --> 08:16.835
and announced that she
was leaving the country.

08:16.872 --> 08:18.397
Other than that, though,
it went real good.

08:18.434 --> 08:20.468

the contextual clues.

you take a horse bristle brush

16:58.362 --> 16:59.736
Okay.

16:59.773 --> 17:01.640
Easy. All right, okay.

17:02.226 --> 17:03.976
Just hang in there.

17:04.727 --> 17:06.861
Oh, my god, Jean. You came!

17:06.936 --> 17:08.483
I was on my favorite ride

17:08.520 --> 17:11.366
strategizing my next fast
pass, when it hit me:

17:11.685 --> 17:14.465
It is a small world after all.

17:14.911 --> 17:16.332
We need to look out for each other.

17:16.368 --> 17:18.333
That's the point of this whole thing.

17:18.369 --> 17:20.194
Boy, I wish you hadn't
had that realization

17:20.232 --> 17:22.625
on a vaguely racist puppet boat tour.

17:22.662 --> 17:24.125
But I'll take what I can get, Jean.

17:24.162 --> 17:25.726
And, boy, I love you.

17:25.830 --> 17:27.765
God damn it. I love you too, Brother.

17:28.055 --> 17:30.063
Um, oh! Uh, this is Shirley.

17:30.100 --> 17:31.285
This is my... this is my sponsor,

17:31.350 --> 17:33.275
It's nice to meet you.

17:33.582 --> 17:35.873
Well, that explains a lot.

17:36.078 --> 17:38.944
You look like you could use
a cup of coffee and a donut.

17:38.981 --> 17:40.316
Oh my god, yes.

17:40.353 --> 17:41.600
Yeah, here. Let's go, baby.

17:41.637 --> 17:43.594
- Oh, god bless you, Jean.
- Yeah, yeah.

17:43.631 --> 17:44.769
- Thank you.
- Here we go.

17:44.806 --> 17:47.039
Hey. You can't leave like that.

17:47.189 --> 17:49.154
We're a team.
I can't do this by myself.

17:49.191 --> 17:50.646
Neither can I. I am so sorry.

17:50.683 --> 17:52.091
I want you to know that in my

17:52.128 --> 17:53.897
darkest, darkest moments just now,

17:53.934 --> 17:55.871
it was your words about a higher power

17:55.908 --> 17:58.954
that came to me when
everything was just blackness.

17:59.007 --> 18:00.305
Well, where did you go?

18:00.342 --> 18:01.748
I went to a bar. Ah!

18:01.785 --> 18:03.984
The only thing I imbibed
was the joy of service.

18:04.021 --> 18:05.449
Now, you ready to call a ball game?

18:05.486 --> 18:06.813
I have been ready all day.

18:06.850 --> 18:08.467
- Well, let's do it.
- Guys, guys, guys.

18:08.504 --> 18:09.632
- [GROANS]
- Oh, what now, Gus?

18:09.669 --> 18:11.182
Newlie's fans have "swatted"

18:11.219 --> 18:12.545
half the baseball stadiums.

18:12.582 --> 18:13.663
- Swatted?
- Yeah.

18:13.700 --> 18:15.571
All of the West Coast
games have been cancelled.

18:15.603 --> 18:17.643
Major League Baseball wants you
to read a statement about it.

18:17.679 --> 18:18.965
- This is bullshit.
- No, no, no.

18:19.034 --> 18:20.124
- We'll read it.
- What?

18:20.161 --> 18:21.719
- We'll read it.
- Wait, I'm sorry.

18:21.756 --> 18:23.197
What are you...
what are you talking about?

18:23.472 --> 18:25.165
We'll read the weak-tea statement,

18:25.202 --> 18:26.824
and then we'll say
just a little bit more.

18:26.861 --> 18:28.770
Okay, but what about the count?

18:28.833 --> 18:30.445
You know, at this point, I'm just gonna

18:30.482 --> 18:32.977
"keep it Brockmire"
and hope for the best.

18:32.996 --> 18:34.405
- Has that ever worked?
- Well,

18:34.442 --> 18:36.309
there's a first time for
everything, isn't there?

18:36.346 --> 18:38.009
[SIGHS] All right.

18:40.580 --> 18:43.973
<i>118 years of baseball history.</i>

18:44.532 --> 18:48.545

19:02.389 --> 19:03.456
I am Jim Brockmire.

19:03.493 --> 19:05.392
I'm joined by my partner, Gabby Taylor,

19:05.589 --> 19:08.331
on this uniquely somber
first day of the season.

19:08.368 --> 19:11.439
As many of you know,
five games were canceled today,

19:11.476 --> 19:13.233
and the MLB has asked us to read

19:13.311 --> 19:14.674
the following statement.

19:14.762 --> 19:16.540
_

19:16.577 --> 19:19.611
_

19:19.699 --> 19:22.048
_

19:22.085 --> 19:24.334
_

19:24.476 --> 19:27.393
Boy... baseball's really
taking the brave stance

19:27.430 --> 19:29.805
against improper
emergency service calls.

19:29.842 --> 19:31.175
- Aren't they?
- Yeah, it certainly is

19:31.244 --> 19:32.677
a whole lot of words kind of

19:32.714 --> 19:34.326
strung together in a row, Jim.

19:34.402 --> 19:35.665
It certainly is, but...

19:35.762 --> 19:37.452
You know, as the focus of today's

19:37.489 --> 19:38.952
hateful fear-mongering,

19:38.989 --> 19:41.583
Gabby and I would like to
say just a few more words.

19:41.620 --> 19:43.416
- Gabby?
- Thanks, Jim.

19:43.485 --> 19:46.445
You know, I'm about to
bring a child into a world

19:46.482 --> 19:49.231
where men like Art Newlie
seem to have their voice

19:49.268 --> 19:52.210
and power just amplified by the minute.

19:52.247 --> 19:54.633
He and his followers
don't want me in baseball.

19:54.670 --> 19:56.237
Or America.

19:56.394 --> 19:59.680
But... people like me have
always been in this game

19:59.717 --> 20:01.022
and this country.

20:01.142 --> 20:03.985
I'm gonna raise this baby
to be a baseball fan,

20:04.023 --> 20:05.364
because this is my game.

20:05.401 --> 20:07.096
You're goddamn right it is.

20:07.251 --> 20:09.484
You know, folks,
my mama always said that

20:09.521 --> 20:11.371
nothing in this life matters.

20:11.466 --> 20:12.720
And on days like this,

20:12.757 --> 20:14.524
when it seems that
stupidity and ignorance

20:14.561 --> 20:16.288
are the only things being rewarded,

20:16.392 --> 20:18.916
it's easy to feel like
she is exactly right.

20:19.215 --> 20:22.012
But I believe that we create
our own meaning in this world.

20:22.134 --> 20:24.136
<i>And out there, on that diamond,</i>

20:24.233 --> 20:25.821
<i>that is a world that has meaning.</i>

20:25.956 --> 20:28.416
<i>Fairness, patience, community,</i>

20:28.620 --> 20:30.202
<i>the knowledge that
we're a part of a team</i>

20:30.238 --> 20:31.974
<i>even when we're by ourselves.</i>

20:32.031 --> 20:34.036
<i>These are the core tenets of baseball.</i>

20:34.152 --> 20:35.426
<i>They're the ones I fight for</i>

20:35.463 --> 20:37.347
<i>inside and outside of this game.</i>

20:37.424 --> 20:39.124
<i>Folks, baseball endures.</i>

20:39.260 --> 20:41.428
It's a relic of a bygone era that,

20:41.497 --> 20:43.831
well, it wasn't even a
particularly good one.

20:43.885 --> 20:46.674
But its continued existence
is a lesson to us all

20:46.728 --> 20:49.317
that we too can make it out of these...

20:49.426 --> 20:50.751
these dark times.

20:50.864 --> 20:52.541
Well said, Jim.

20:54.068 --> 20:56.631
Stay tuned for the first
pitch when we return.

20:56.910 --> 20:58.126
[VOICE OVER] And we're clear.

20:58.203 --> 21:01.463
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

21:05.772 --> 21:07.952
I want you to be this kid's godfather.

21:08.030 --> 21:09.362
Are you kidding me?

21:09.494 --> 21:12.363
Gabby, that is all I have wanted.

21:12.403 --> 21:14.750
Well, that means that if you die...

21:14.787 --> 21:16.419
Oh, no. It's not legally binding.

21:16.528 --> 21:18.071
If I die, the baby goes to my mother.

21:18.108 --> 21:19.665
And if she dies,
the baby goes to the state.

21:19.728 --> 21:21.006
Right, but if the state dies

21:21.043 --> 21:23.360
and California becomes this
apocalyptic wasteland...

21:23.487 --> 21:26.304
Oh, yeah, then you need
to take custody of my child

21:26.348 --> 21:27.751
and escort them through
the end of times

21:27.788 --> 21:29.128
like a Cormac McCarthy novel.

21:29.165 --> 21:30.749
That's actually a
lot of responsibility.

21:30.785 --> 21:31.822
'Cause the way things are going,

21:31.859 --> 21:34.522
there's a 15% chance of that
happening in our lifetime.

21:34.559 --> 21:35.593
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

21:35.630 --> 21:36.680
Here we go.

21:39.402 --> 21:41.069
Welcome back, folks,
as we turn our attention

21:41.146 --> 21:43.580
to what's actually going on
out there on the ball field.

21:43.732 --> 21:45.913
19-year-old phenom Danny Carney

21:45.950 --> 21:47.474
making his Major League debut

21:47.511 --> 21:49.335
on the mound out there for Tampa

21:49.372 --> 21:51.443
as Lewis settles into
the box for Oakland.

21:51.480 --> 21:53.620
And here comes the opening pitch

21:53.657 --> 21:55.341
of the 2019 season.

21:55.458 --> 21:57.536
It is a fastball high.
