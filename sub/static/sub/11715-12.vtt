WEBVTT

00:02.837 --> 00:05.380
The key to a proper
cup of tea

00:05.422 --> 00:08.049
is warming the kettle
with a splash
of boiling water.

00:08.091 --> 00:09.510
"Cold kettles make
tasteless tea,"

00:09.551 --> 00:10.678
Grandmother
always said.

00:11.679 --> 00:14.598
My word, I'm even
boring myself.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.558
No, it's sweet.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.644
Listen, with all that's
going on in my life,

00:18.686 --> 00:20.646
it's nice to have someoe
looking out for me.

00:20.688 --> 00:23.357
Yes, Katie. I heard
about your recent break.

00:23.398 --> 00:24.232
So sorry.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.779
Well, it's my fault
for dating a musician.

00:28.821 --> 00:32.157
I don't know why,
but I always fall
for a guy with a guitar.

00:32.199 --> 00:34.201
Mmm. Maybe instead
of a guitarist,

00:34.242 --> 00:35.953
you should think
about someone

00:35.995 --> 00:39.122
who sings in
an a cappella group.

00:39.164 --> 00:40.875
Yeah, yeah.
'Cause a cappella
groups are so hot.

00:43.752 --> 00:45.796
Yes. I certainly meant t
as an outrageous statement.

00:47.589 --> 00:48.883
Here we are.

00:48.924 --> 00:50.342
Thank you, Timmy.

00:50.384 --> 00:51.343
You're a good friend.

00:51.385 --> 00:52.427
Mmm. A friend.

00:55.347 --> 00:56.598
What a wonderful foundation
on which to build...

00:56.640 --> 00:57.599
And she's gone.

01:00.686 --> 01:02.563
Look like you're
about to cry, chief.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.064
Are those palefaces
littering again?

01:06.817 --> 01:08.610
Well done, sir.
If I had known you

01:08.652 --> 01:10.153
eight years ago,
we could have attended

01:10.195 --> 01:14.616
that reference's
30th birthday together.

01:14.658 --> 01:17.578
Cranky. Who pee-peed
in your tepee?

01:22.791 --> 01:24.376
If you must know,
I'm upset about Katie.

01:25.878 --> 01:27.922
Oh, that sweet little tg
in Accounting?

01:27.963 --> 01:29.882
You bash that out yet?

01:29.924 --> 01:32.133
Huh? You give her
the old Bollywood?

01:35.888 --> 01:38.139
No, and since she's leag
the company on Friday,

01:38.181 --> 01:39.600
there shall be
no bashing,
I'm afraid.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.227
Or any giving of
the aforementioned wood.

01:46.356 --> 01:47.983
Look, I'll help you
with this chick,

01:48.025 --> 01:49.610
but you gotta do
what I say.

01:49.651 --> 01:50.861
It can't be like
those other times

01:50.903 --> 01:52.863
when you refused
my wise advice.

01:52.905 --> 01:55.198
Yes. I missed
a golden opportunity

01:55.240 --> 01:56.867
by not claiming
to be the inventor
of 7-Eleven.

02:00.037 --> 02:01.496
Say what you will,
I'm a closer.

02:01.538 --> 02:03.457
Well, I will grant you

02:03.498 --> 02:05.042
a more-than-passing
resemblance to
Kyra Sedgwick.

02:07.210 --> 02:09.254
Mmm. Emmy winner?
One degree of Kevin Bacon?
I'll take it.

02:12.299 --> 02:13.592
You can save
your advice, sir.

02:14.718 --> 02:16.762
I'm not her type.
She likes musicians.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.891
Mmm. Did you tell her
you're an accomplished
skin flautist?

02:23.560 --> 02:26.855
I did not mention that.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.649
All right.
I think it's time
for a grand gesture.

02:29.232 --> 02:31.986
Something big.

02:32.027 --> 02:34.780
I want you to get up
at her farewell party,

02:35.739 --> 02:36.865
and serenade her
on the guitar.

02:38.325 --> 02:39.743
I don't play guitar.

02:39.785 --> 02:41.202
I'll teach you.

02:41.244 --> 02:42.203
You don't play guitar.

02:43.872 --> 02:45.707
I know one song,

02:45.749 --> 02:49.128
which is enough
to get a chick
who digs musicians.

02:49.168 --> 02:51.254
Sir, and what happens
when they get to know y,

02:52.297 --> 02:55.092
and realize
it's all been a scam?

02:55.134 --> 02:56.969
"Oh, no, the chick
I just banged
found out I lied!

02:57.011 --> 02:57.719
"I lose!"

03:00.139 --> 03:03.100
Come on, Tim,
let me help you here.

03:03.142 --> 03:04.643
Well, I'll never be able
to live with myself

03:05.477 --> 03:06.478
if I don't
at least try.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.188
So, fine.
I accept your help.

03:10.649 --> 03:13.234
Good. If I get
a guy some ass,
he gets it for a day.

03:15.070 --> 03:16.655
But if I teach him
to get it for himself,

03:17.656 --> 03:18.740
he's tapping forever.

03:21.493 --> 03:22.243

03:25.873 --> 03:26.957
Hi. Why are you
so happy?

03:28.083 --> 03:29.292
You know how you're
always telling me

03:29.334 --> 03:30.878
to stop messing with Tiy
for my own amusement?

03:30.919 --> 03:36.675
Yeah.
I went a different way.

04:04.828 --> 04:06.080
Hey, babe, can you
turn that off for a sec?

04:06.121 --> 04:07.998
I want
to talk about something.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.083
Am I in trouble?

04:09.958 --> 04:11.919
No, I just wanna talk.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.170
Sounds like
I'm in trouble.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.465
So, I had lunch today
with Carol from work...

04:17.841 --> 04:18.592
Ugh.

04:22.012 --> 04:24.556
And she was telling me
about this thing

04:24.598 --> 04:26.349
that she and her husband
do every night
before they go to sleep.

04:26.391 --> 04:27.392
Every night, huh?

04:29.019 --> 04:31.479
Well, those big gals
have to try harder.

04:31.521 --> 04:32.313
No, not that.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.026
Before they go to sleep,
Carol and her husband

04:36.068 --> 04:37.194
say five things they lie
about each other.

04:37.236 --> 04:38.153
Mmm.

04:39.696 --> 04:43.283
Please tell me we're
not having dinner
with these people.

04:43.324 --> 04:46.286
Jeff, lately I have
been feeling a little
unappreciated.

04:46.745 --> 04:47.454
How so?

04:48.956 --> 04:53.085
Well, for my last birth,
you gave me the NFL package.

04:53.127 --> 04:55.462
And when the throat docr
told you I couldn't talk
for a week,

04:55.503 --> 04:59.340
you sent him
a thank you note.

04:59.382 --> 05:01.384
You always said that
that's good manners.

05:01.426 --> 05:02.886
Yeah, when someone
gives you a gift.

05:02.928 --> 05:03.804
Well...

05:08.475 --> 05:09.726
Jeff, I need
my five things.

05:11.603 --> 05:13.939
Fine. One, two.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.858
It can't be physical.

05:16.900 --> 05:17.358
All right, I also
happen to love...

05:17.400 --> 05:18.777
Or sexual.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.070
Aud, you're killing me.

05:22.239 --> 05:25.450
I know this kind of thig
is not easy for you,
so you take your time.

05:25.492 --> 05:26.576
I'm gonna go
get a glass of water.

05:26.618 --> 05:27.869
You just sit here
and relax.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.957
And, babe, please try
not to think of this
as a bad thing, okay?

05:31.999 --> 05:32.707
Okay.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.294
(DOOR CLOSING)

05:35.335 --> 05:36.544
This is a very
bad thing.

05:42.676 --> 05:43.677
Hey.
Hey.

05:43.718 --> 05:44.511
Well...

05:46.680 --> 05:48.682
I finally outsmarted
that pigeon
I've been feuding with.

05:48.723 --> 05:52.311
That's terrific.

05:52.351 --> 05:55.897
Oh, my God.
This is Jeff and Audreys
financial statement.

05:55.939 --> 05:57.816
Wow, I guess the mailman
screwed it up.
I'll run it over to the.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.110
No, you can't.
They'll think
we looked at it,

06:00.152 --> 06:01.736
and that'll
make things weird.
Just throw it out.

06:01.778 --> 06:02.612
Yeah.

06:03.905 --> 06:05.740
Yeah, that's definitely
the right thing to do.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.785
Oh, man.
They're rich.

06:11.205 --> 06:13.207
I can't believe
Jeff charged me
an extra 20 cents

06:13.248 --> 06:15.250
when I wanted
to put pickles
on my burger.

06:15.292 --> 06:16.626
Adam, don't look at tha.
That's really personal..

06:16.668 --> 06:17.752
Whoa, that's a lot.

06:19.420 --> 06:20.463
And that's
just mutual funds.

06:20.505 --> 06:21.298
Yes.

06:22.507 --> 06:25.760
And who's this Ira guy?
He's crushing it.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.428
I cannot believe
they have that much money.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.682
Is it weird that Jeff
just got sexier to me?

06:30.724 --> 06:31.850
That's not
weird at all.

06:36.980 --> 06:39.066
Maybe I'll get
some pie to go.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.441
Should I get apple
or blueberry?

06:42.069 --> 06:43.695
Get them both.
You can certainly
afford it.

06:47.032 --> 06:49.284
I'll just get
a fudgesicle at home.

06:49.326 --> 06:50.202
Ugh, home.

06:51.619 --> 06:52.829
Audrey wants me
to come up

06:52.871 --> 06:54.497
with five things
I like about her.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.375
Mmm, that's easy.
She's got her two...

06:56.415 --> 06:57.209
Can't be sexual.

06:58.626 --> 06:59.627
I'm out.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.672
What's with the guitar,
Neil not-Young?

07:06.093 --> 07:08.511
I'm gonna teach Timmy a song
so he can embarrass himself

07:08.553 --> 07:12.015
in front of
the entire company.

07:12.057 --> 07:13.183
You're a hell
of a boss.

07:14.642 --> 07:18.897
Firm but fair.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.482
Who can just rattle off
five things he likes
about his wife?

07:21.524 --> 07:23.651
Well, Jen's my best fri,
she smiles when she sees me,

07:23.693 --> 07:25.237
she's kind
to animals...

07:25.279 --> 07:27.948
Doesn't count.
You're not married.

07:27.989 --> 07:29.199
Once that ring's
on your finger,

07:29.241 --> 07:33.287
those things become nais
on a chalkboard.

07:33.328 --> 07:35.080
Can you get this?

07:35.122 --> 07:36.581
Aw, look, Jeff,
I only have, like, $2, .

07:38.625 --> 07:40.043
Well, we're not
gonna stay here
and do dishes, Lucy.

07:40.085 --> 07:48.343
Give them
your credit card.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.220
Sir, is this an A,

07:50.804 --> 07:51.763
or an A-minor?

07:54.391 --> 07:57.102
I don't know.
Just put your fingers
where I told you to put the.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.645
Ah, a glimpse
into your dating life.

08:01.731 --> 08:03.984
Look, I... I just want
to make sure I'm moving
my wrist properly.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.403
Well, come on.
If you don't
learn this song,

08:06.445 --> 08:08.155
you're gonna be moving
your wrist a-plenty.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.741
I'm sorry, sir. I'm just
not sure I'm going

08:12.826 --> 08:14.661
to have enough time
to perfect this.

08:14.702 --> 08:17.122
That's the beauty of th,
it doesn't have to be perfe.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.916
You just gotta
get your 'tude going.

08:19.958 --> 08:20.792
'Tude?

08:21.584 --> 08:23.878
Yeah, 'tude.
Stand up.

08:24.712 --> 08:25.422
All right.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.883
Let's try to figure out
what your vibe is, exac.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.386
Uh...
Vibe. All right.

08:31.428 --> 08:32.637
Give me a little, uh,
Elvis sneer.

08:33.805 --> 08:34.973
You know Elvis, right?

08:37.184 --> 08:38.018
Huh! Huh!

08:40.145 --> 08:41.980
That's him.
All right.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.482
You know, and maybe
a little Mick Jagger.

08:44.065 --> 08:45.108
Little strut.

08:45.150 --> 08:45.984
Oh, yeah.

08:47.319 --> 08:48.862
Oh, yeah. Okay.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.531
Aw, that's good.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.326
That is good.

08:54.368 --> 08:56.119
And maybe that
Pete Townshend windmill.

08:56.161 --> 08:57.537
Wow!
Yeah.

08:58.663 --> 09:00.832
Wow!
Oh, my God.

09:01.749 --> 09:03.001
That is...
That's fantastic.

09:05.170 --> 09:07.005
Really, really, um...
You think Katie
will like it?

09:07.047 --> 09:07.755
Who?

09:09.132 --> 09:09.924
Katie.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.552
Katie! Oh, the Katie...
That's the...

09:12.593 --> 09:13.887
Why we're doing this,
for Katie.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:13.928 --> 09:15.596
She's gonna
love it. Now...

09:15.638 --> 09:21.102
Let's try them,
all three together.
Crank it out.

09:21.144 --> 09:23.355
Wow! Wow!

09:24.647 --> 09:26.233
(A LA ELVIS) Thank you.
Thank you very much.

09:28.068 --> 09:28.818
Good stuff.

09:31.612 --> 09:32.489
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

09:34.199 --> 09:36.576
Oh, hey, Aud.
Hey, can I borrow
some soy sauce?

09:36.617 --> 09:38.870
I was about to make
some Ramen noodles.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.622
Uh, I'm sorry.
Ramen noodles are
an inexpensive meal

09:41.664 --> 09:43.083
traditionally enjoyed
by college students

09:43.124 --> 09:47.462
and the budget-consciou.

09:47.504 --> 09:48.838
Yeah, I know...
I know what
Ramen noodles are.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.340
Oh, sure.
I know what caviar is.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.927
Doesn't mean
I've ever had it.

09:53.968 --> 09:54.969
Just get the soy sauce.

09:59.349 --> 10:01.726
So what if Jeff
doesn't come up
with five things?

10:01.768 --> 10:03.728
I mean,
feelings aren't really
in his wheelhouse.

10:03.770 --> 10:04.896
I know, that's why
I'm doing this.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.565
To bring out
his emotional side.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.441
He has one?

10:10.444 --> 10:12.112
Well, we know
he has a heart.
He's on Lipitor.

10:14.655 --> 10:16.241
I took the regular.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.658
I noticed you
also had low-sodium.

10:19.494 --> 10:24.165
Must be nice to be
swimming in soy sauce.

10:24.207 --> 10:25.625
Uh, hey, Jeff.
Hey.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.877
You two are
gonna have to leave.

10:27.919 --> 10:29.588
I've got five things I e
about my wife,

10:29.629 --> 10:31.381
and, um, after I'm done
saying them,

10:32.382 --> 10:33.674
I'm hoping
to be richly rewarded.

10:36.886 --> 10:37.887
Well, well.

10:38.930 --> 10:45.853
The rich get richer.
Let's go, Jen.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.188
So you got
your five things.

10:47.230 --> 10:48.940
I knew you could
do it, babe.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.442
That's right.
When Jeff Bingham
has an assignment,

10:50.484 --> 10:51.401
he delivers.

10:54.862 --> 10:57.282
Number one...
You make me want
to be a better man.

11:02.370 --> 11:06.541
Two...
You complete me.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.046
You do.

11:14.882 --> 11:16.176
Three...
All right.

11:16.217 --> 11:17.552
I'm gonna stop you
right there.

11:19.804 --> 11:22.516
"As Good as It Gets,
Jerry Maguire,
When Harry Met Sally.."

11:22.557 --> 11:24.225
These are all movie quos
from movies I made you watc.

11:27.521 --> 11:29.772
Well...
You make me want
to see better movies.

11:34.653 --> 11:36.029
"Say hello
to my little friend"?

11:42.118 --> 11:44.078
Well, that was gonna be
for when I was
richly rewarded.

11:44.538 --> 11:45.330
Mmm-hmm.

11:49.459 --> 11:50.960
You know,
I... I didn't want you

11:51.002 --> 11:51.919
to come up
with these immediately.

11:51.961 --> 11:53.754
That's why
I gave you time.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.882
You could...
Jeez, you couldn't even
come up with one?

11:55.923 --> 11:57.342
Uh, come on.

11:58.717 --> 12:00.387
Just a boy, standing
in front of a girl...

12:03.598 --> 12:05.099
Can't believe I even
know that one.

12:13.608 --> 12:15.776
I know how much you love
those short rib tacos,

12:15.818 --> 12:18.071
so when I saw
the food truck parked
on Third Avenue,

12:18.112 --> 12:19.864
I thought
I'd surprise you.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.491
You take such good care
of me, sweetheart.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.951
That's because
I love you.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.078
Have a good day.
Okay.

12:29.082 --> 12:33.211
Dan,
I couldn't help noticing
you liking your wife.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.213
Yeah, she's the best.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.508
Look, she even wrote
"I love you"
on the taco wrapper.

12:38.550 --> 12:39.926
Audrey once put a note
in my lunch,

12:39.967 --> 12:41.177
but I accidentally
ate it.

12:42.220 --> 12:43.930
What's the trick?

12:43.971 --> 12:47.308
Have you tried
eating slower?

12:47.350 --> 12:49.018
No, to make her think
that you like her.

12:49.728 --> 12:51.312
I... I do like her.

12:51.354 --> 12:52.439
Come on,
it's just us.

12:54.315 --> 12:56.150
What I need are five
sure-fire things

12:56.192 --> 12:57.569
that I like
about my wife.

12:59.987 --> 13:03.366
You want me to tell you
what you like
about your wife?

13:03.408 --> 13:04.451
That'd be terrific.

13:06.703 --> 13:08.871
Well, I guess
when I'm with Barbara,

13:08.913 --> 13:11.249
I notice all the little
things she does.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.710
Oh. Oh, there it was
in front of my eyes
the whole time.

13:13.752 --> 13:15.211
It's pretty simple.

13:15.253 --> 13:16.421
Yeah, it's real simple.

13:19.424 --> 13:20.300
You want me
to write that down for ?

13:20.341 --> 13:21.384
That'd be great.

13:30.226 --> 13:31.978
This guy's all over
your girlfriend.

13:32.019 --> 13:34.481
He's going in
for the kill.

13:34.522 --> 13:36.733
Sir, have you noticed
all your phrases
about courtship

13:36.775 --> 13:39.152
involve the threat
of violence?

13:39.193 --> 13:40.695
Have you noticed
you never get any?

13:41.696 --> 13:43.197
All right?
Now grab your guitar.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.823
Let's do this.
It's now or never.

13:44.865 --> 13:46.785
I'm not sure
about this, sir.

13:46.825 --> 13:47.910
I am rather nervous.

13:49.746 --> 13:53.124
Fact. Tom Jones
feels this way
before every performanc.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.833
Fact. Tom Jones
gets pummeled
with panties.

13:57.462 --> 13:58.672
All right, sir.
Yeah?

13:58.713 --> 14:00.131
Okay.
I've come this far.

14:03.134 --> 14:04.093
Thank you.

14:05.844 --> 14:08.097

expressing yourself in g

I've been trying

14:25.615 --> 14:27.200
for the past few months,
but the words...

14:28.785 --> 14:30.495
They've not come to me.
But fortunately,

14:31.538 --> 14:33.247
where words fail,
there is song.

14:33.832 --> 14:35.041

more eloquently
