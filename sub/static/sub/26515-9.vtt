[Kory]
<i>Previously on</i> Titans...

00:21.292 --> 00:23.126
[thug] What the fuck
is this guy wearing?

00:23.161 --> 00:24.262
He's an eagle.

00:24.295 --> 00:26.763
-[grunts]
-Hawk, dipshit.

00:30.300 --> 00:34.338
-I should leave you
hanging like this.
-Whatever turns you on.

00:34.338 --> 00:36.039
[Jason] Who are your friends?
[Dick] Not important.

00:36.073 --> 00:37.674
-Hi, I'm Rachel.
-Jason.

00:37.674 --> 00:38.576
Wait, you're Robin, too?

00:38.576 --> 00:40.143
-I thought you were Robin.
-I am.

00:40.177 --> 00:41.813
He was.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.548
Hey.

00:48.018 --> 00:49.549
Hi.

00:49.549 --> 00:52.122
Hell of a coincidence,
him showing up here
night before a job.

00:52.155 --> 00:54.292
But now that he's here,
we could use his help.

00:54.325 --> 00:55.793
We don't need him.

00:55.793 --> 00:58.429
We could go out
on the win you want.
And then you can heal.

00:58.463 --> 01:01.432
[mom] Well, hello there,
you four.

01:03.433 --> 01:05.069
Who the fuck
are these guys?

01:05.102 --> 01:06.137
[grunts]

01:06.170 --> 01:08.805
Hank!

01:08.838 --> 01:11.876
No!

01:11.909 --> 01:13.210
Do you feel anything?

01:13.243 --> 01:14.644
Rachel, I don't think this--

01:14.677 --> 01:18.816
[exhales heavily]

01:18.849 --> 01:21.117
[distorted voices]

01:21.152 --> 01:24.120
[screaming]

01:24.155 --> 01:25.689
[camera beeps]

01:25.724 --> 01:29.159
[Hawk] Okay. Ready?
[Don] Ready when
you are, bro.

01:29.192 --> 01:31.228
[Hawk] Lens cap, bro.
[Don] Oh, yeah. Right.

01:31.262 --> 01:33.364
-Okay.
-Okay.

01:33.397 --> 01:36.033
It's April 24th, 2009.
Day one--

01:36.066 --> 01:37.402
Night one. Night one.

01:37.435 --> 01:38.769
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:38.802 --> 01:40.605
-All right, let's do it again.
-Okay.

01:40.638 --> 01:42.805
-Okay. Ready?
-Yeah, yeah.

01:42.840 --> 01:44.409
Okay.

01:44.441 --> 01:49.079
It's April 24th, 2009,
night one of
the Hawk and the Dove.

01:49.112 --> 01:51.314
I'm Hawk.

01:51.349 --> 01:53.784
And I'm Dove.

01:53.816 --> 01:55.019
We're on a stakeout.

01:55.052 --> 01:56.554
We're looking
for this creeper who--

01:56.587 --> 01:58.689
-Shit. Shit.
-You okay? Bro?

01:58.722 --> 02:00.224
I can't see through
this fuckin' thing.

02:00.259 --> 02:01.760
-We gotta lose
the helmets, man.
-No, no. You can't. You can't.

02:01.760 --> 02:03.361
The doctor said you need it
for protection, bro.

02:03.361 --> 02:05.662
Fuck the doctor.
My head's fine.

02:05.697 --> 02:08.532
All right.
We're on a stakeout.

02:08.566 --> 02:11.235
We're looking
for this creeper.

02:11.269 --> 02:13.304
Oh, fuck yeah.
Oh, that's him.

02:13.336 --> 02:15.573
-Let me see.
-Dwayne Wainwright.

02:15.606 --> 02:17.709
Arrested yesterday
for uploading graphic pictures

02:17.709 --> 02:19.978
of a ten-year-old
at a local coffee shop.

02:20.010 --> 02:23.747
Denied it. Lawyered up.
Gonna waste tax payers'
time and money.

02:23.782 --> 02:26.616
We're here to persuade him
to plead guilty.

02:26.650 --> 02:28.286
[grunting]

02:28.318 --> 02:29.554
My turn. My turn. My turn.

02:29.586 --> 02:31.055
-Let me. Let me.
-Go, go. Yeah.

02:31.087 --> 02:32.122
Yeah.

02:32.156 --> 02:35.455
No. No, no! [grunting]

02:39.864 --> 02:42.421
Batman and Robin,
you've got company.

02:43.433 --> 02:45.469
Being fucking superheroes!

02:45.502 --> 02:48.372
This is gonna be awesome.

02:48.406 --> 02:51.556
[theme music playing]

03:38.188 --> 03:40.123
[mom] <i>Well, hello there,
you four.</i>

03:40.157 --> 03:41.991
[monitor beeping]

03:42.026 --> 03:43.860
[Dawn] <i>Hank!</i>

03:43.894 --> 03:47.343
[Hank] <i>No! Dawn!</i>

04:51.161 --> 04:52.930
-[whistle blowing]
-[moans]

04:52.963 --> 04:54.298
[crowd cheering]

04:54.331 --> 04:57.932
[player]
Down! Set! Hut!

05:05.475 --> 05:06.826
Go, Hank!

05:16.387 --> 05:18.088
[blowing whistle]

05:18.122 --> 05:22.360
All right, Hank!
Nice job!

05:22.392 --> 05:23.892
Yay, Hank!

05:36.072 --> 05:39.776
Okay, fellas! Reset!

05:39.810 --> 05:42.512
-See you tomorrow, Hank.
-See you, Jeremy.

05:42.547 --> 05:46.747
Bye, Hank.
Awesome job, man.

05:57.194 --> 06:01.932
What are you guys doing?

06:01.966 --> 06:04.367
Coach Vincent's
going to show me
the weight room.

06:04.401 --> 06:06.403
Donny wants to be
a big player.

06:06.437 --> 06:09.586
Like his big brother.

06:12.242 --> 06:15.144
Thanks, but we
gotta get going.

06:15.178 --> 06:16.447
Our mom's waiting for us.

06:16.480 --> 06:19.350
Your mom's not here,
is she?

06:19.382 --> 06:21.619
Donny says
she got another job.

06:21.651 --> 06:24.523
Working nights now, too.
Cleaning offices downtown.

06:24.555 --> 06:29.225
You boys are lucky
to have a mom that works
so hard to take care of you.

06:29.259 --> 06:31.528
Two different dads,

06:31.562 --> 06:34.464
but no dads.

06:34.499 --> 06:38.999
I'm sure
it must be difficult.

06:39.903 --> 06:42.206
-Come on, Donny.
-But I wanna see
the weight room.

06:42.238 --> 06:43.442
Now.

06:43.475 --> 06:48.379
If Donny wants to stay,
I can give him
a ride home later.

06:48.411 --> 06:51.862
It's no problem at all.

06:55.052 --> 06:58.351
We need to fucking go.

07:01.425 --> 07:05.795
You think your mother
would approve of
that kind of language?

07:05.829 --> 07:07.264
No.

07:07.298 --> 07:09.666
What would the school do
if I went to Mr. Sheridan

07:09.701 --> 07:11.970
and told him
what you and
your brother said?

07:12.002 --> 07:13.605
But Donny
didn't say anything.

07:13.639 --> 07:17.408
If I told him that
Hank and Donny Hall were
using profanity like that,

07:17.440 --> 07:21.345
directed at a teacher?

07:21.379 --> 07:25.081
He'd revoke
your scholarship.

07:25.115 --> 07:29.052
He'd expel you.

07:29.086 --> 07:31.656
Both of you.

07:31.689 --> 07:34.225
And then it's
back to public school,

07:34.259 --> 07:39.259
where dirty-mouthed boys
from the slums belong.

07:41.565 --> 07:46.302
You want to disappoint
your mother like that?

07:46.336 --> 07:50.387
I don't wanna
get expelled.

07:55.346 --> 07:58.649
I'll go see
the weight room.

07:58.682 --> 08:00.216
But I wanna see it, too.

08:00.250 --> 08:01.685
-No!
-Why?

08:01.718 --> 08:04.088
You'll never be as good
a football player as me.

08:04.122 --> 08:07.692
So, no. You're not going.
You're going home. Now!

08:07.725 --> 08:08.826
But, Hank...

08:08.860 --> 08:12.629
Go home now!
Get out of here!

08:12.663 --> 08:15.512
You're such a jerk!

08:20.471 --> 08:22.673
[door opens]

08:22.706 --> 08:24.574
[door slams shut]

08:24.608 --> 08:25.809
Come on.

08:44.729 --> 08:45.897
[commentator] <i>It's been
an undefeated season</i>

08:45.929 --> 08:47.865
<i>for the Kesel Lions
here at Grac Field.</i>

08:47.899 --> 08:51.135
<i>But the Dayton Hogs
are fierce today,
and the hits are coming hard.</i>

08:51.168 --> 08:55.840
<i>Here we go.
Reeves dropping back to pass.
He's moving left.</i>

08:55.873 --> 08:57.643
<i>He hits Hank Hall
in the middle of the field.</i>

08:57.676 --> 09:01.010
<i>Hank turns. Spins
to the 45, to the 50.
He evades the tackle.</i>

09:01.043 --> 09:02.447
Yes, yes, yes.

09:02.480 --> 09:05.548
<i>To the sideline and, ooh!
He is leveled
by the free safety.</i>

09:05.582 --> 09:07.184
-No, Hank.
<i>-That does not look good.</i>

09:07.217 --> 09:09.687
<i>Medical personnel
are on the field now
attending to Hank Hall,</i>

09:09.720 --> 09:11.621
<i>running back
for the Kesel Lions.</i>

09:11.655 --> 09:13.615
<i>Let's hope he's okay.</i>

09:29.573 --> 09:32.475
Hey, what's up?
How you doing?
Good shindig, guys.

09:32.509 --> 09:33.845
Looking good.

09:33.878 --> 09:37.815
Hey, Hank.
You look good.

09:37.849 --> 09:39.784
-Hey! How you doing?
-Hey! Good.

09:39.817 --> 09:43.120
-You did such a good job.
-You look good!
Thank you. No, I'm just...

09:43.153 --> 09:45.456
Hank.

09:45.489 --> 09:48.625
Donny boy! Hey!

09:48.658 --> 09:50.927
How you doin', buddy?

09:50.961 --> 09:53.163
Everybody,
it's my little brother!

09:53.197 --> 09:54.597
[all cheering]

09:54.631 --> 09:56.368
Let's get you a beer, bro.

09:56.368 --> 09:58.168
Man, I thought you were
coming home after the game.

09:58.168 --> 09:59.736
Thought you were
coming to the game.

09:59.770 --> 10:01.773
I watched it.

10:01.806 --> 10:04.042
Did they check you out?
You could have a concussion.

10:04.075 --> 10:06.711
I got an appointment
with Dr. Kraft tomorrow.

10:06.744 --> 10:09.178
Come on, Ren's around here
somewhere. Linda, too.

10:09.212 --> 10:11.182
Both looking hot.

10:11.216 --> 10:15.052
Okay, well, should you
be drinking right now?
I mean...

10:15.086 --> 10:17.087
You're starting to
sound like Mom again, bro.

10:17.121 --> 10:19.390
I'm not.
I just worried
that maybe--

10:19.423 --> 10:23.027
Come on. Please.
Bro, we won.
It's playoff week.

10:23.061 --> 10:25.863
Everyone's having
a good time.
Relax, all right?

10:25.897 --> 10:30.567
Worry is for tomorrow.
Hakuna mata, baby brother.

10:30.600 --> 10:35.405
Come on, man.
Let's get you a...

10:35.438 --> 10:38.174
Donny?

10:38.207 --> 10:40.043
Hank?

10:40.076 --> 10:42.647
Hank!

10:42.679 --> 10:44.649
How long have the migraines
been going on?

10:44.682 --> 10:48.719
Migraines?
He didn't say he
had migraines.

10:48.753 --> 10:51.355
-Few months.
-What?

10:51.389 --> 10:54.892
Too many wins.
Too many celebrations.
You know what I mean?

10:54.926 --> 10:57.059
Any light sensitivity?

10:57.094 --> 10:58.830
Ugh!

10:58.863 --> 11:00.498
Memory loss?

11:00.530 --> 11:02.366
Uh...

11:02.399 --> 11:05.769
-What do you mean?
-Problems remembering names?

11:05.802 --> 11:08.840
Nah. Not really.

11:08.873 --> 11:12.110
I mean, yeah,
maybe a little. You know?

11:12.143 --> 11:14.678
I'm supposed to remember
everybody I meet?

11:14.711 --> 11:16.380
I got fans everywhere.

11:16.413 --> 11:20.184
Look, I'm good. I'm great.
I promise. All right?

11:20.217 --> 11:23.120
I drank a little too much.
That's it.

11:23.153 --> 11:26.191
Post-concussion syndrome
is serious, Mr. Hall.

11:26.224 --> 11:30.427
I've seen athletes
suffer from symptoms
after one hit. You've had...

11:30.461 --> 11:32.464
You've had a lot, man.

11:32.496 --> 11:35.966
These could
resolve themselves
on their own, but...

11:36.000 --> 11:37.735
I'm going to prescribe
some pills for the pain--

11:37.768 --> 11:38.936
I don't like pills.

11:38.970 --> 11:40.804
[sighs heavily] Hank.

11:40.837 --> 11:42.307
I can't force you
to take them,

11:42.340 --> 11:45.143
but if the pain
gets to be too much...

11:45.176 --> 11:48.445
Look, I can still play,
can't I?

11:48.479 --> 11:50.014
You need to rest.

11:50.048 --> 11:51.916
Take the time
to heal properly,

11:51.948 --> 11:54.818
so you don't risk
any permanent damage.

11:54.851 --> 11:57.687
Yeah.

11:57.721 --> 12:01.326
Soon as the season's over.

12:01.359 --> 12:03.727
-Let's get out of here, man.
-[sighs heavily]

12:03.760 --> 12:05.260
I'm sorry.

12:20.477 --> 12:22.947
-What the fuck, man?
-Hank, dude,
what are you doing?

12:22.980 --> 12:24.215
You called
the athletic director?

12:24.249 --> 12:25.950
You told him?
Why the hell would
you do that?

12:25.982 --> 12:27.317
Listen. They told you
you gotta take a break.

12:27.351 --> 12:28.986
-I'm just making sure--
-Take a break?

12:29.020 --> 12:30.788
We got playoffs next week,
and now I'm sitting
on the goddamn bench!

12:30.822 --> 12:33.124
No, fuck the playoffs, man!
I'm trying
to help you out here.

12:33.157 --> 12:34.692
That wasn't your
decision to make!

12:34.725 --> 12:35.860
It was mine! All right?

12:35.893 --> 12:37.128
-Not yours. Mine!
-Calm down.

12:37.160 --> 12:38.929
-Don't fucking tell me
to calm down.
-Bro...

12:38.962 --> 12:40.865
Don't fucking tell me
to calm down again!

12:40.898 --> 12:42.033
I'm looking out for you, man.

12:42.033 --> 12:43.567
I didn't fucking ask you
to look out for me!

12:43.601 --> 12:45.302
-Stay out of my life!
-I don't wanna see you
get hurt again!

12:45.336 --> 12:47.004
You're not
my fuckin' mom, man!

12:47.038 --> 12:49.039
This is actually
a library, asshole.

12:49.072 --> 12:50.240
Fuck off me, man.

12:50.274 --> 12:51.708
-What the hell?
-Oh, shit.

12:51.741 --> 12:55.792
Are you okay? Are you okay?

13:10.995 --> 13:12.797
-Oh.
-Uh-oh.

13:12.830 --> 13:15.200
We're gonna get in
so much trouble.

13:15.232 --> 13:17.634
[Dean Kesser]
They could press charges.

13:17.668 --> 13:19.538
Probably will.

13:19.571 --> 13:24.008
And now, I'm left
to make a tough decision.

13:24.042 --> 13:26.010
You're a good student, Don.

13:26.044 --> 13:31.044
Although this is not
the ideal use of your
extra-curricular martial arts.

13:31.582 --> 13:34.118
Still, you've never been
in any trouble before.

13:34.152 --> 13:35.986
Quite the opposite, actually.

13:36.019 --> 13:37.522
But, Hank...

13:37.556 --> 13:40.191
I don't want to lose you,
the team doesn't

13:40.225 --> 13:42.360
but there are cameras
all over

13:42.394 --> 13:45.062
and they verified
you started this fight.

13:45.096 --> 13:48.698
So, he started the fight.
He's sorry he did.

13:48.732 --> 13:50.067
I didn't hear him say that.

13:50.100 --> 13:52.003
Yeah, I'm sorry.

13:52.035 --> 13:54.639
Well, that's not gonna
be good enough.

13:54.673 --> 13:57.107
I'm gonna need you
to write out
a formal apology--

13:57.140 --> 13:59.844
-When is it gonna
be good enough?
-Write a...

13:59.876 --> 14:02.080
When?

14:02.113 --> 14:05.850
My brother's already given
everything to this school.

14:05.883 --> 14:08.485
He's given his health.

14:08.519 --> 14:10.553
But you still want more.

14:10.587 --> 14:12.557
He needs help. Okay?

14:12.591 --> 14:15.759
What he really needs
is to get the hell away
from here

14:15.793 --> 14:17.061
and away from
people like you.

14:17.095 --> 14:19.964
So, you know what?
Just... Just do it already.

14:19.996 --> 14:23.399
What?

14:23.433 --> 14:24.969
Kick us

14:25.001 --> 14:28.342
the fuck out.

15:06.710 --> 15:08.479
Hank.

15:08.511 --> 15:10.514
Hank!

15:10.547 --> 15:13.283
Hank.

15:13.317 --> 15:15.418
Hank!

15:15.451 --> 15:18.855
Hank!

15:18.889 --> 15:19.889
Hank!

15:28.032 --> 15:31.034
Mom always said
I was the bad kid.

15:31.067 --> 15:33.171
She never said that.

15:33.203 --> 15:35.272
Well, she knew it.

15:35.304 --> 15:36.640
I am.

15:36.674 --> 15:41.674
When I play ball,
the bad inside me
comes out in a different way.

15:42.078 --> 15:44.248
A good way.

15:44.282 --> 15:47.250
That's why I need it.

15:47.284 --> 15:49.320
But football's
all I got, Donny.

15:49.354 --> 15:53.254
It's not all you got, man.

15:54.625 --> 15:56.559
This is all my fault.

15:56.592 --> 15:58.662
What...

15:58.696 --> 16:01.698
How is this your fault?

16:01.731 --> 16:05.135
[sighs heavily]

16:05.168 --> 16:07.313
The locker room.

16:09.549 --> 16:12.942
Nothing happened.

16:12.976 --> 16:15.946
Hank...

16:15.980 --> 16:19.580
Nothing happened, Donny.

16:30.961 --> 16:32.831
We have to find a way
to deal with this.

16:32.864 --> 16:36.868
Letting your anger out
and doing something
good with it, okay?

16:36.902 --> 16:40.304
Just like he said.
If it's not gonna
be football, then...

16:40.337 --> 16:45.288
There's got to
be something else.

16:50.447 --> 16:52.583
Boxing.

16:52.616 --> 16:55.019
Maybe we start
our own fight club.

16:55.052 --> 16:56.120
First rule of Fight Club.

16:56.153 --> 16:58.921
[both]
Don't talk about Fight Club.

17:04.961 --> 17:07.897
You know...

17:07.932 --> 17:11.382
I do have another idea.

17:13.337 --> 17:16.173
[Hank] This is crazy.
They map these sick fucks?

17:16.207 --> 17:18.509
Yeah. Yeah. They have to.
It's required by law.

17:18.542 --> 17:20.778
Sexual predators
have to register.

17:20.811 --> 17:22.913
Why the hell are they all
clustered in our neighborhood?

17:22.913 --> 17:24.883
'Cause no one gives a shit
about our neighborhood.

17:24.883 --> 17:29.586
Or the people in it.
They haven't
since we were kids.

17:29.619 --> 17:30.955
Look at this guy.

17:30.989 --> 17:34.192
He was caught trying to
pick up an 8-year-old
girl at the park.

17:34.224 --> 17:36.027
What happened to him?

17:36.059 --> 17:38.261
Police wrote him up
and sent him home.

17:38.296 --> 17:41.865
Two blocks away.

17:41.898 --> 17:45.036
[exhales] Oh!

17:45.068 --> 17:49.708
Kicked out of fucking school.

17:49.740 --> 17:53.310
Mom would be
so pissed at us right now.

17:53.344 --> 17:56.146
The system sucks, Hank.

17:56.180 --> 17:58.249
It failed Mom
when she got sick.

17:58.281 --> 18:02.353
It failed us after she died.

18:02.386 --> 18:04.355
It's failed a lot of kids.

18:04.388 --> 18:08.138
What you're suggesting...

18:09.792 --> 18:11.796
You're not like me, Donny.

18:11.829 --> 18:15.432
This would be
us looking for trouble.

18:15.465 --> 18:19.066
You never liked trouble.

18:21.172 --> 18:25.142
So, teach me how to like it.

18:25.175 --> 18:26.977
We can do this, Hank.

18:27.010 --> 18:29.013
You can do this.

18:29.047 --> 18:34.047
Guys like this out there,
they're not built like
the guys you hit on the field.

18:37.855 --> 18:42.855
What the hell are we
gonna call ourselves, then?

18:45.229 --> 18:47.479

18:56.807 --> 18:59.509

20:42.980 --> 20:44.615

20:53.124 --> 20:54.923
Brava!

20:56.827 --> 21:01.231
I thought you were
absolutely wonderful,
my darling.

21:01.265 --> 21:02.534
[Dawn] Thanks, Mom.

21:02.567 --> 21:05.236
Proper tea!
Who'd've thought?

21:05.269 --> 21:06.804
In the colonies, even.

21:06.836 --> 21:08.936
[both chuckle]

21:14.744 --> 21:16.747
Scone's not good?

21:16.779 --> 21:18.249
No, no.

21:18.281 --> 21:21.184
Delicious. Quite good.

21:21.219 --> 21:22.868
What is it?

21:26.457 --> 21:27.991
I'm flying back Friday.

21:28.025 --> 21:31.561
-What?
-To London.

21:31.595 --> 21:35.132
To him.

21:35.165 --> 21:37.201
Jesus Christ, Mom.

21:37.236 --> 21:40.371
I thought you were
leaving him for good.
You promised me you were.

21:40.404 --> 21:43.140
That you were
gonna start over.

21:43.173 --> 21:45.108
It's not that simple,
you know?

21:45.142 --> 21:49.779
Yes, it is.
Don't go back!

21:49.813 --> 21:51.613
[Dawn sighs]

21:55.353 --> 21:59.252
When's it gonna be enough?

22:00.657 --> 22:03.694
Remember that time,
when you broke his arm?

22:03.728 --> 22:05.128
I should've broke them both.

22:05.162 --> 22:07.097
He stopped.

22:07.131 --> 22:09.833
For a long while.

22:09.866 --> 22:13.770
He was so much better.

22:13.804 --> 22:15.806
He can be better.

22:15.838 --> 22:19.009
Hmm.

22:19.044 --> 22:21.980
[sighs]
And then your sister
got into trouble again.

22:22.012 --> 22:25.148
Shoplifting, of all things.
And he lost his temper.

22:25.182 --> 22:26.416
Mom, listen to me,

22:26.451 --> 22:29.353
because I'm going to get
really angry in a second.

22:29.386 --> 22:32.223
You did nothing wrong.

22:32.257 --> 22:34.424
And I don't care
what kind of trouble
Holly got into.

22:34.459 --> 22:36.560
He never should've hit her.

22:36.594 --> 22:41.133
Or me. Or you. Ever.

22:41.165 --> 22:46.165
You need to
leave him for good.
Like I did and like Holly did.

22:46.570 --> 22:50.207
He's a fucking monster, Mom.

22:50.240 --> 22:54.144
I'm so sorry.

22:54.178 --> 22:59.127
You must think
I'm terribly weak.

22:59.517 --> 23:04.166
You're stronger
than you think.

23:08.625 --> 23:11.476
I love you so much.

23:16.299 --> 23:18.603
[Don] There it is!
Front page news!

23:18.635 --> 23:20.137
Hawk and Dove,
they got our names right!

23:20.172 --> 23:22.406
-They got our names right!
-Look at this.
This is awesome.

23:22.440 --> 23:24.642
-You gotta get this.
-[Hank stammers]

23:24.675 --> 23:25.809
Dude, look at your suit.

23:25.844 --> 23:28.079
-Is that enough?
-Look at this. Vigilantes...

23:28.113 --> 23:31.715
-Kind of warm
for Christmas, huh?
-It is, but I love it.

23:31.750 --> 23:34.986
-Bro, you look great.
-No, no, no.
I love your shin guards.

23:35.019 --> 23:37.121
You got the whole thing.
It worked out--

23:37.153 --> 23:38.288
-Oh, my goodness.
-Jesus.

23:38.288 --> 23:39.857
-I'm so sorry. Are you okay?
-My fault.

23:39.891 --> 23:44.262
-We're sorry.
-[laughing] Sorry.

23:44.296 --> 23:48.767
Thank you, darling.
Well, aren't you two
handsome lads.

23:48.799 --> 23:52.636
And such gentlemen, too.
Wouldn't you agree, darling?

23:52.670 --> 23:54.138
Yeah, Mom. They're great.

23:54.172 --> 23:57.007
-Sorry about that. I feel bad.
-It's okay. It's okay.

Donny!
-[Dawn] Mom!

24:21.700 --> 24:26.700
[man] I'm grateful that
there are no more holidays
coming up for a while.

24:28.538 --> 24:31.942
They just remind me
that, um...

24:31.976 --> 24:35.490
I don't look forward
to much anymore.

24:37.213 --> 24:42.086
I try not to look forward.

24:42.118 --> 24:44.865
That's it, I guess.

24:46.957 --> 24:50.227
Dawn?

24:50.260 --> 24:53.861
Would you like to speak?

24:56.133 --> 24:57.201
No.

24:57.233 --> 25:01.238
Who else didn't
have a chance?

25:01.271 --> 25:02.271
You?

25:07.345 --> 25:08.345
Pass.

[soft music playing]

25:33.804 --> 25:36.973
Hi.

25:37.007 --> 25:39.609
I'm Dawn. I...

25:39.644 --> 25:43.113
We met that day.

25:43.146 --> 25:44.146
Hank.

25:48.819 --> 25:53.691
My mom died on B-Street.

25:53.724 --> 25:56.827
If I wanted to
talk back there

25:56.861 --> 26:01.861
I would've held hands
and sang <i>Kumbaya.</i>

26:08.305 --> 26:10.674
I'm sorry.

26:10.708 --> 26:12.958
I'm an asshole.

26:15.945 --> 26:19.115
[sighs]

26:19.148 --> 26:22.686
It's okay.

26:22.720 --> 26:27.369
-It helps sometimes.
-I get it.

26:29.559 --> 26:32.363
He was
my younger brother.

26:32.395 --> 26:36.768
My only brother.

26:36.800 --> 26:39.050
My best friend.

26:48.278 --> 26:51.315
Tell me about him.

26:51.348 --> 26:54.199
His name was Donny.

27:05.328 --> 27:08.031
I'll see you next week.

27:08.065 --> 27:09.932
Yeah.

27:09.967 --> 27:13.203
Maybe.

27:13.237 --> 27:14.237
Okay.

27:26.217 --> 27:28.618
I want you all to know

27:28.653 --> 27:33.603
that feeling a sense
of emptiness

27:34.625 --> 27:37.996
is completely normal.

27:38.028 --> 27:42.979
But trying to
fill the emptiness,

27:45.836 --> 27:50.473
that can be a challenge.

27:50.508 --> 27:53.877
Anyone else?

27:53.912 --> 27:58.383
[Dawn] What happened
to my mom,

27:58.416 --> 28:03.416
to everyone we love
who was hurt and killed...

28:05.890 --> 28:10.528
It was an accident.

28:10.560 --> 28:12.661
It's not fair.

28:16.166 --> 28:21.166
It's not fair that
it wasn't anyone's fault...

28:24.842 --> 28:29.814
That there isn't anyone
out there to blame,

28:29.846 --> 28:31.946
to go after...

28:39.390 --> 28:40.589
To hate.

28:49.232 --> 28:51.633
Life isn't fair.

28:56.440 --> 29:00.811
Why not?

29:00.845 --> 29:04.744
Why can't we make it fair?

29:15.692 --> 29:18.863
Hey.

29:18.895 --> 29:22.532
Can I buy you a drink?

29:22.566 --> 29:27.566
I'd like to hear
more about your mom.

29:47.525 --> 29:51.528
For sure.

29:51.561 --> 29:53.198
Put the butter on your plate.

29:53.230 --> 29:54.766
Why can't I
put it on the biscuit?

29:54.798 --> 29:57.268
Because you don't want to
double dip your knife.

29:57.300 --> 30:00.104
And now the jam.

30:00.136 --> 30:04.508
Okay.

30:04.541 --> 30:07.545
Not on the whole thing!

-It's the best part.
-It's fine.

30:09.814 --> 30:11.316
All right.

30:11.348 --> 30:14.051
Now take a piece
and you put a little butter
and jelly on it.

had good taste.

would've liked you.

30:47.718 --> 30:48.718
Duh.

some help with that?

30:54.692 --> 30:57.863
[Hank]
No. No, I think I got it.

30:57.895 --> 31:01.031
I'd just like to get a little
extra char on the...
On the beef.

31:01.065 --> 31:03.034
I think your
kitchen's on fire.

31:03.067 --> 31:04.734
I just wanna make sure
you're not eating raw...

31:04.734 --> 31:05.970
Have you ever
done this before?

31:05.970 --> 31:08.471
-[fire alarm beeping]
-[Dawn] Oh.

31:08.506 --> 31:11.174
Just part of the plan.

31:11.208 --> 31:13.743
Oh, okay.

31:13.778 --> 31:18.016
-It's still good.
-Got it.

31:18.048 --> 31:21.051
I mean, at least you tried.

31:21.085 --> 31:22.921
Should we order out?

32:02.894 --> 32:04.761
Oh, no.

32:04.795 --> 32:06.329
Tank's dry.

32:06.363 --> 32:08.012
So is mine.

32:11.634 --> 32:16.607
You wanna sleep over?

32:16.641 --> 32:19.609
-On the couch. That's all.
-Oh, is that all?

32:19.643 --> 32:21.246
-Yeah.
-Hmm.

32:21.278 --> 32:24.915
-You think I want you
in my bed?
-No. [laughs]

32:24.949 --> 32:29.787
You think I...

32:29.819 --> 32:31.488
You want some help?

32:31.521 --> 32:32.590
I got it.

32:32.624 --> 32:34.925
I mean, you literally
charmed the pants off of me.

32:34.959 --> 32:36.394
It's the least I can do.

32:36.428 --> 32:39.028
Wait, Dawn, no.
Don't go in there.
Please don't go in there.

32:44.500 --> 32:46.451
What is this?

32:56.280 --> 32:59.884
[Hank on tape]
<i>We're here to persuade him
to plead guilty.</i>

32:59.916 --> 33:01.553

My turn. My turn.</i>

<i>-Let me. Let me.
-[Hank]</i> <i>Go, go. Yeah.</i>

33:04.520 --> 33:06.057
<i>Yeah.</i>

33:06.089 --> 33:08.339
[both grunting]

33:13.330 --> 33:17.067
[Don] <i>Batman and Robin,
you've got company.</i>

33:17.101 --> 33:19.136
<i>Being fucking superheroes!</i>

33:19.170 --> 33:21.838
<i>This is gonna be awesome.</i>

33:21.873 --> 33:24.107
Hawk and Dove.

33:24.142 --> 33:27.944
You and your brother.

33:27.979 --> 33:30.614
Why?

33:30.647 --> 33:32.115
Neighborhood needs help.

33:32.150 --> 33:37.150
And you thought
dressing up helped it?

33:37.755 --> 33:40.991
It helped me, too.

33:41.025 --> 33:43.275
Helped you how?

33:46.630 --> 33:49.967
Hank.

33:50.000 --> 33:54.672
Whatever it is,
you can tell me.

33:54.704 --> 33:56.473
I don't wanna talk about it.

33:56.508 --> 33:58.442
You're gonna have to
talk about it, eventually.

33:58.476 --> 34:02.780
It's obviously eating you up.

34:02.814 --> 34:07.814
It's more than what happened
to your brother, isn't it?

34:10.521 --> 34:12.222
Hey.

34:12.257 --> 34:17.257
Whatever it is,
I promise I'll understand.

34:33.077 --> 34:36.047
When I was a boy,

34:36.079 --> 34:40.251
there was this coach.

34:40.284 --> 34:43.019
He used to take me
in the locker room
after practice

34:43.054 --> 34:47.925
and tell me
what a great job I did.

34:47.958 --> 34:52.009
That I was his star player.

35:00.670 --> 35:02.621
I'm so sorry.

35:06.677 --> 35:09.827
What'd you do to him?

35:12.916 --> 35:14.751
Nothing.

35:14.784 --> 35:17.688
Nothing?

35:17.722 --> 35:19.757
I thought you said that's what
your brother and you did.

35:19.757 --> 35:23.793
-You went
after guys like that.
-We did.

35:23.827 --> 35:25.561
Not him.

35:25.596 --> 35:29.065
Why not?

35:29.099 --> 35:30.750
I couldn't.

35:34.471 --> 35:37.141
If I did,

35:37.175 --> 35:40.010
it would make it all real.

35:40.010 --> 35:41.646
I didn't want to
let it be real.

35:41.679 --> 35:45.615
I didn't want
my brother to find out.

35:45.648 --> 35:48.385
But he did.

35:48.418 --> 35:49.617
He knew.

35:58.262 --> 36:02.012
[dog barking in distance]

38:03.286 --> 38:04.286
Dawn?

38:44.094 --> 38:46.795
[doorbell ringing]

38:53.471 --> 38:55.773
Can I help you?

38:55.806 --> 38:58.675
You need to admit
what you did.

38:58.708 --> 38:59.708
Excuse me?

38:59.710 --> 39:02.780
What you did to Hank Hall.

39:02.813 --> 39:05.382
You need to
turn yourself in.

39:05.416 --> 39:07.284
I don't know what
you're talking about.

39:07.318 --> 39:09.653
I'm not leaving.
Admit what you did.

39:09.653 --> 39:11.789
I didn't do anything.

39:11.822 --> 39:13.958
[Dawn grunts]

39:13.992 --> 39:16.702
-I'm gonna call the police.
-Good. Call them.

39:24.402 --> 39:25.503
Whoa.

39:25.536 --> 39:27.804
Get out of my house.

39:27.838 --> 39:29.907
Get out!

39:29.940 --> 39:32.041
Okay.

39:32.076 --> 39:33.076
Okay.

40:29.367 --> 40:32.036
I'm sorry.

40:32.068 --> 40:35.072
I... I didn't...

40:35.106 --> 40:38.275
[Dawn] Hank.
These are pictures of kids.

40:38.309 --> 40:42.045
He's a sick man.

40:42.079 --> 40:45.282
He's sick.

40:45.315 --> 40:47.117
You were never here.

40:47.150 --> 40:48.918
What?

40:48.952 --> 40:50.920
Go home, Dawn.

40:50.954 --> 40:52.755
Go home now!

41:00.398 --> 41:01.398
No.

Dawn.

43:20.505 --> 43:24.474
[sighs heavily]

43:24.509 --> 43:29.447
Tonight...

43:29.480 --> 43:32.684
Tonight never happened.

43:32.717 --> 43:36.753
We can't be together, Hank.

43:36.788 --> 43:38.887
Not like this.

43:45.262 --> 43:49.762
[distorted voice] <i>Dawn.</i>

43:51.969 --> 43:54.639
<i>Help me.</i>

43:54.672 --> 43:56.273
<i>Help.</i>

What the fuck?

Hank.

Hank.

Hank.

44:17.394 --> 44:18.596
Dawn.

44:18.628 --> 44:20.197
Hank.

44:20.231 --> 44:23.067
We need a doctor in here.
We need a doctor in here!

44:23.099 --> 44:25.168
Shh.

44:25.202 --> 44:28.739
Hey. It's okay.

44:28.773 --> 44:30.974
We need to find Jason Todd.

44:31.009 --> 44:33.476
What? Who the hell
is Jason Todd?

44:33.510 --> 44:35.278
I don't know.

44:35.311 --> 44:39.211
But Rachel needs our help.

44:42.485 --> 44:43.485
Okay.
