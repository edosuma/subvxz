Mom!

00:06.599 --> 00:10.402
- I'm not ready to sign my rights away.
- I can't raise this kid.

00:10.436 --> 00:13.905
The school board voted to
shut down Carlton for good.

00:13.940 --> 00:15.207
I cannot lose that second chance.

00:15.241 --> 00:17.943

We will end our occupation of Carlton

01:10.363 --> 01:12.698

01:15.234 --> 01:18.437
The Carlton campus will remain open

01:19.539 --> 01:22.974
and the student body will be comprised

01:23.009 --> 01:24.976
of deaf students only.

01:25.011 --> 01:27.846
And there will be no recriminations

01:27.880 --> 01:31.149
for any of the students
involved in the occupation.

01:32.952 --> 01:36.888
You are in no position
to be making demands.

01:37.890 --> 01:39.925
The only question right now

01:39.959 --> 01:42.828
is will you be removed by force

01:42.862 --> 01:45.764
or will you come out voluntarily?

that prolonged temper tantrum?

Hey! Did you talk to the press?

04:39.497 --> 04:42.365
Yeah. Why, am I quoted?

04:42.400 --> 04:44.234
We didn't take over the school

04:44.268 --> 04:46.403
so a hearing person could speak for us.

04:46.437 --> 04:49.139
No, you took it over

04:49.173 --> 04:51.308
so you could make sure that people like me

04:51.342 --> 04:53.510
never go there again.

05:00.417 --> 05:02.102
- Heyo.
- Hi.

05:04.272 --> 05:06.389
Ahem...

05:06.423 --> 05:09.192
So I have some killer news.

05:09.227 --> 05:11.261
- Oh yeah?
- Um, a few months ago

05:11.295 --> 05:14.364
this really inspiring guy came
to talk to our youth group.

05:14.398 --> 05:17.367
He started his own nonprofit

05:17.401 --> 05:20.337
that helps communities in
Peru get access to clean water?

05:20.371 --> 05:22.439
- Yeah, I've heard of stuff like that.
- Yeah.

05:22.473 --> 05:25.008
So I applied for this...

05:25.042 --> 05:26.376
scholarship thing...

05:26.410 --> 05:28.378
and I got it!

05:28.412 --> 05:31.014
- That's amazing!
- Yeah.

05:31.048 --> 05:33.216
I'm gonna be teaching kids

05:33.251 --> 05:35.185
- music and English.
- Oh.

05:35.219 --> 05:37.287
Man, I'd love to teach music to kids.

05:39.156 --> 05:41.258
Well, I mean, I would love for you to come,

05:41.292 --> 05:45.362
but technically it is a missions trip,

05:45.396 --> 05:49.032
so we're gonna be helping
people out, but also

05:49.066 --> 05:51.201
- witnessing to them.
- That's cool.

05:51.235 --> 05:53.336
I'll hang back here.

05:53.371 --> 05:58.074
So is this like an
over-the-summer kind of thing?

05:58.109 --> 06:00.243
- Or?
- The end of summer.

06:02.280 --> 06:04.414
For six months.

06:04.448 --> 06:08.118
As in 180 days?

06:08.152 --> 06:10.086
183.

06:10.121 --> 06:12.255
I counted.

06:16.327 --> 06:19.296
This could be an incredible

06:19.330 --> 06:21.998
and humbling experience

06:22.033 --> 06:24.267
- and I really feel like...
- Of course

06:24.302 --> 06:26.469
I want you to go. That sounds amazing.

06:26.504 --> 06:30.407
- It's just, you know...
- I know.

06:30.501 --> 06:32.502
We just got back together.

06:32.536 --> 06:35.505
I am gonna hate being away from you, too.

06:35.539 --> 06:38.108
But in the context of
the rest of our lives,

06:38.142 --> 06:40.477
six months really isn't that long.

06:40.511 --> 06:42.512
The rest of our lives?

06:42.546 --> 06:45.448
That sounds like thousands of days.

06:45.523 --> 06:47.557
Years even.

06:48.592 --> 06:51.161
Hmm.

06:51.195 --> 06:53.179
- You heading out?
- Oh yeah.

06:53.230 --> 06:55.231
Early bird gets the State Senate seat,

<i>(Stomps)</i>

07:56.422 --> 07:57.589
We still need to talk

07:57.624 --> 08:00.125
about that text you sent
while you were in there.

08:00.160 --> 08:03.162
I need to contact Emmett and
everyone and see what this means.

08:03.196 --> 08:05.264
I understand that, but
we still need to talk.

08:06.432 --> 08:08.267
(Sighs)

08:08.301 --> 08:11.069
You were passed out.

08:11.104 --> 08:14.940
After a long day of job-hunting.

08:14.974 --> 08:17.142
I think I've earned
the right to fall asleep

08:17.177 --> 08:19.778
in front of the TV without
being called a drunk.

08:19.812 --> 08:23.015
- You smelled like alcohol.
- I know Bay is all wound up

08:23.049 --> 08:26.718
because I am dating a musician, so
I am not sure what she has told you,

08:26.753 --> 08:28.787
but I'm fine.

08:28.821 --> 08:30.656
I am not drinking.

08:31.758 --> 08:33.491
You promise?

08:33.525 --> 08:34.592
Promise.

08:38.198 --> 08:40.198
Okay. I'm sorry.

08:41.366 --> 08:43.235
Let me know what they tell you.

08:48.208 --> 08:49.975
That's just insane.

08:49.898 --> 08:52.983
Wasn't he just in the hot tub
with Patricia Sawyer's daughter?

08:53.001 --> 08:55.752
Yeah, which apparently drove him
right back into the arms of Nikki.

08:55.787 --> 08:58.789
They're both 18, so there's
legally nothing we can do about it.

08:58.823 --> 09:01.725
- I know. I know.
- They're looking for apartments, honey, and jobs.

09:01.759 --> 09:04.761
- And this is so unlike him.
- This obviously is not just gonna go away.

09:04.796 --> 09:06.713
I don't know where this is coming from.

09:06.764 --> 09:09.299
Well, since you took him to
that church and he met Nikki...

09:09.334 --> 09:12.169
- Oh, so it's my fault?
- No, I'm just saying

09:12.203 --> 09:15.339
not sleeping with someone till you're
married is one way to find yourself engaged.

09:15.373 --> 09:17.374
I don't think this is about sex.

09:17.358 --> 09:19.893
<i>Well, not just about sex.</i>

09:19.928 --> 09:23.831
Why couldn't he just occupy his high
school like everybody else in the family?

09:25.066 --> 09:27.201
- We have to do something.

Bay: She just, like, jumped down my throat,

09:54.265 --> 09:57.467
saying no one asked me to
speak for the deaf community.

09:57.485 --> 10:00.137
All I did was answer a question.

10:00.171 --> 10:04.041
It's like she's gone
from student-body leader

10:04.075 --> 10:06.109
to Kim Jong-Daphne.

10:07.178 --> 10:09.263
What?

10:09.314 --> 10:12.199
Deaf people always have

10:12.233 --> 10:15.118
hearing people speaking for them.

10:15.136 --> 10:17.988
I wasn't trying to speak for anybody.

10:18.022 --> 10:20.707
I was just answering a question.

10:20.758 --> 10:23.961
All I'm saying is that I
see why Daphne was upset.

10:27.565 --> 10:31.401
We're aware that you were the
leader, that's why you're here.

10:31.436 --> 10:34.505
But as reckless as your actions were,

10:34.539 --> 10:37.441
your protest has forced the school board

10:37.475 --> 10:40.511
to reconsider closing Carlton.

10:47.418 --> 10:50.187
But there will be some changes.

10:50.221 --> 10:53.157
The student body will expand to include

10:53.191 --> 10:55.792
more hearing students

10:55.827 --> 10:58.028
and we agreed to 50%.

14:10.837 --> 14:13.522
Wow, I can't believe

14:13.556 --> 14:15.407
that you are so jealous of Noah

14:15.441 --> 14:16.675
that you would stoop to this.

14:16.676 --> 14:18.478

<i>(Jazz music playing)</i>

15:04.274 --> 15:05.958
- Hey!
- Hi.

15:08.905 --> 15:11.107
Saw you were playing, thought I'd stop by.

15:19.049 --> 15:21.650
Club soda, please. Thanks.

15:22.753 --> 15:24.920
You are a busy man. Did you get my texts?

15:24.955 --> 15:27.390
I'm sorry. It sounded like
you had your hands full

15:27.424 --> 15:29.759
with that whole school
stuff. So how'd it turn out?

15:29.793 --> 15:33.262
They're keeping the school
open... with a few conditions.

15:33.296 --> 15:35.598
- Congratulations.
- I'll pass that along to the girls.

15:35.632 --> 15:39.168
Or you can, the next time you see them.

15:39.202 --> 15:42.972
Ah. Which won't be for a few months...

15:43.006 --> 15:44.240
actually.

15:46.109 --> 15:49.111
- We got the tour.
- (Gasps) That is great.

15:49.146 --> 15:51.781
Oh.

15:51.815 --> 15:54.950
You know, I do make a pretty good groupie.

15:54.985 --> 15:57.553
Maybe I could meet you for a few days.

15:57.587 --> 15:59.789
It'd be so good to get out of town.

15:59.823 --> 16:02.625
I would love that, but we're
not gonna have much downtime.

16:02.659 --> 16:05.361
Either we're gonna be
driving, sleeping or playing.

16:07.597 --> 16:10.266
And I'm guessing you're
going to be pretty busy

16:10.300 --> 16:13.102
<i>between now and when you leave.</i>

16:13.136 --> 16:15.371
Yeah, between rehearsal

16:15.405 --> 16:18.374
<i>- and getting plans together.
- Look,</i>

16:18.408 --> 16:21.977
I know I had a little bit
too much the other night,

16:22.012 --> 16:26.015
- but it's been awhile and I'm just trying to...
- Look, Regina, it's cool.

16:26.049 --> 16:29.685
Okay? I'll call you when I get back.

16:29.719 --> 16:31.687
Absolutely.

16:41.531 --> 16:44.433
- Bay: They should have put yours in a tub.
- This was a medium.

16:44.468 --> 16:46.502
At least you don't have
to worry about fitting

16:46.520 --> 16:49.171
into your "Romeo and
Juliet" costume anymore.

16:49.206 --> 16:52.007
That's true. I do feel
bad for your mom, though.

16:52.042 --> 16:53.375
Well, you too.

16:54.377 --> 16:56.879
Are you sorry it's over?

16:56.913 --> 16:59.315
Well, I'm not gonna
miss all the rehearsals.

16:59.349 --> 17:02.985
- (Clears throat)
- No more kissing Daphne.

17:03.019 --> 17:04.954
Nope.

17:04.988 --> 17:07.823
Which I'm sure she's relieved about.

17:09.893 --> 17:12.828
It was just acting, right? You and Daphne?

17:14.664 --> 17:16.598
I don't know.

17:16.633 --> 17:17.900
Wait, what?

17:21.471 --> 17:22.637
We had a connection.

17:24.441 --> 17:27.409
I tried to ignore it and I
thought that it would go away.

17:28.411 --> 17:31.213
- Oh my God.
- I'm so sorry.

17:31.248 --> 17:34.383
I've been trying to find
a way to tell you this.

17:34.417 --> 17:37.052
I think you just did.

17:39.923 --> 17:41.974
(Breathes deeply)

17:51.468 --> 17:54.436
- Hi.
- Hi. Can I talk to you for a second?

17:54.471 --> 17:55.638
Sure.

17:55.672 --> 17:58.407
- I'll see you guys later.
- Okay.

18:04.214 --> 18:06.448
I know that this seems crazy,

18:06.483 --> 18:09.351
but we really do love each other.

18:09.386 --> 18:13.822
But, Nikki, you're about to go off to
Peru and have this amazing experience...

18:13.857 --> 18:15.991
an experience that
could change your life...

18:16.026 --> 18:18.093
and I really think that you should trust

18:18.128 --> 18:21.063
that if you're meant to be, you'll
find your way back to each other.

18:22.799 --> 18:23.999
But we already did.

18:24.034 --> 18:28.437
Nikki, Toby is a little lost right now.

18:28.471 --> 18:31.440
Finding out about the switch
is so recent for all of us.

18:31.474 --> 18:34.610
We're still trying to figure
out how we all fit in together.

18:34.644 --> 18:36.645
I know.

18:36.680 --> 18:40.049
So don't you think it's easy for him

18:40.083 --> 18:42.151
to want to attach himself to a future

18:42.185 --> 18:44.320
with a strong confident girl like you?

18:45.922 --> 18:48.991
Well, I don't think that's the only reason.

18:49.025 --> 18:52.127
He is not ready for
this kind of commitment.

18:53.930 --> 18:55.864
Just think about it.

18:56.866 --> 18:58.567
<i>(Knocking)</i>

19:02.539 --> 19:04.506
All right, all right! I'm coming.

19:15.352 --> 19:18.087
- Gina.
- In bed already?

19:18.121 --> 19:21.090
You really are getting to be an old man!

19:22.392 --> 19:24.226
Can I come in?

19:24.261 --> 19:26.128
Of course.

19:32.002 --> 19:34.003
Have you been drinking?

19:34.037 --> 19:35.804
No.

19:38.675 --> 19:39.975
Maybe a little.

19:41.544 --> 19:44.580
And I started thinking about you

19:44.614 --> 19:48.317
and what an idiot I was
to walk away from you.

19:48.351 --> 19:50.386
Gina, let me drive you home.

19:50.420 --> 19:53.188
No no no no no.

19:53.223 --> 19:55.357
Daphne and Bay

19:55.392 --> 19:58.360
do not understand the
difference between a few drinks

19:58.395 --> 20:02.097
and being a drunk. I can't go home.

20:03.166 --> 20:05.067
You're stuck with me.

20:05.101 --> 20:07.169
Daphne and Bay know you're drinking?

20:07.203 --> 20:09.138
I don't want to talk about that.

20:09.172 --> 20:11.874
I don't want to talk...

20:11.908 --> 20:13.042
at all.

20:14.711 --> 20:16.712
Okay well, why don't you

20:16.746 --> 20:20.733
sit on the couch while I put on some music?

20:20.784 --> 20:22.685
Sounds good.

20:23.820 --> 20:25.554
Something romantic,

20:25.588 --> 20:27.790
so we can dance. Oh.

20:27.824 --> 20:29.758
Of course.

20:29.793 --> 20:32.261
You should lay down and rest

20:32.295 --> 20:33.562
while I find the right music.

20:33.596 --> 20:35.431
That's a good idea.

20:39.169 --> 20:40.969
(Sighs)

20:54.191 --> 20:56.292
Oh hey. Do you know where Kathryn

20:56.326 --> 20:58.161
put that caramel sauce?

21:01.832 --> 21:02.899
<i>(Bowl bangs)</i>

21:04.068 --> 21:06.035
Here you go.

21:06.070 --> 21:08.054
Anything else you want?

21:08.088 --> 21:10.807
Butter, eggs, my boyfriend?

21:10.841 --> 21:12.875
Oh, that's right. You already took that.

21:12.910 --> 21:14.844
- Bay...
- So congratulations,

21:14.878 --> 21:18.464
now you don't have to be in a
play so you two can make out.

21:18.515 --> 21:21.517
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- We broke up.

21:21.552 --> 21:25.188
- I had nothing to do with that.
- Oh, please.

21:25.222 --> 21:26.589
All that time "rehearsing,"

21:26.623 --> 21:29.425
bonding over hearing aids and basketball.

21:29.460 --> 21:31.994
Did we become friends? Yes.

21:32.029 --> 21:34.997
But I didn't try to steal your
boyfriend. I wouldn't do that.

21:35.032 --> 21:37.200
You never wanted to be in
the play in the first place,

21:37.234 --> 21:40.036
and somehow you end up with
the lead opposite my boyfriend.

21:40.070 --> 21:43.072
- Kathryn made me Juliet!
- And then you throw that all over

21:43.107 --> 21:45.875
so that you can be the
leader of the deaf revolution.

21:45.909 --> 21:47.844
And God forbid that I should even attempt

21:47.878 --> 21:50.913
- to answer a reporter's question!
- God, enough!

21:50.948 --> 21:53.883
Don't you get tired of seeing
yourself as the victim all the time?

21:53.917 --> 21:56.619
I didn't used to feel like
that until you showed up.

22:01.525 --> 22:03.259
<i>(Door slams)</i>

22:07.231 --> 22:09.132
<i>- (Knocks)
- Yeah?</i>

22:09.166 --> 22:11.367
John? There's somebody here to see you.

22:11.401 --> 22:13.269
Okay, can you...

22:13.303 --> 22:15.905
<i>Oh no.</i>

22:15.939 --> 22:17.273
What now?

22:19.142 --> 22:21.778
I'll make it quick. I
wanted to let you know

22:21.812 --> 22:24.714
that tomorrow morning my
office will release a statement

22:24.748 --> 22:26.816
announcing my withdrawal from the race.

22:26.850 --> 22:28.718
Wait a second, I don't understand...

22:28.752 --> 22:31.654
The official explanation
will be "a family matter."

22:31.688 --> 22:33.790
Is everyone okay? Is
this about your daughter?

22:33.824 --> 22:36.526
- Don't worry, your son isn't in the line of fire.
- I wasn't...

22:36.560 --> 22:39.228
I'm... I'm sorry.

22:39.263 --> 22:41.631
I appreciate your concern.

22:46.136 --> 22:48.104
Elisa's bipolar. (Sighs)

22:48.178 --> 22:50.279
We've been managing it,

22:50.314 --> 22:53.249
but she's going through
a really rough time and...

22:53.283 --> 22:56.018
- She needs me.
- Yeah, of course.

22:56.053 --> 22:58.120
Patricia, I...

22:58.155 --> 23:01.891
I understand and I know
how much this meant to you.

23:01.925 --> 23:03.993
Anyway,

23:04.027 --> 23:06.562
you're getting off easy for round one.

23:06.597 --> 23:08.764
I'm sure we'll see each
other down the line.

23:08.799 --> 23:10.700
We will.

23:10.734 --> 23:12.835
Thanks for keeping my seat warm.

23:12.870 --> 23:14.670

23:29.453 --> 23:33.072
- Hi.
- Hello... fiancée.

23:35.158 --> 23:38.761
So I found this really sweet
one bedroom. It's downtown.

23:38.779 --> 23:41.864
It's affordably priced and they
throw in a free flat screen.

23:43.834 --> 23:46.535
Do you think that we're rushing this?

23:46.570 --> 23:50.539
I don't want us to be doing
this just because I'm going away.

23:52.542 --> 23:54.677
I thought we were doing this
'cause we love each other.

23:57.547 --> 24:00.316
But what if, without even meaning to,

24:00.350 --> 24:02.084
I'm, like,

24:02.119 --> 24:04.153
throwing your life off course?

24:04.187 --> 24:07.156
Actually, you're giving it a course.

24:07.190 --> 24:09.091
That's what I mean.

24:09.126 --> 24:12.194
I don't want you to marry me
just because I give you purpose.

24:14.097 --> 24:16.899
Maybe you should go to college

24:16.934 --> 24:19.602
and find your path.

24:19.636 --> 24:22.705
That sounds oddly parental. (Chuckles)

24:24.675 --> 24:26.542
Your mom came and talked to me.

24:35.218 --> 24:38.454
Nikki, my whole life,
I have pretty much done

24:38.488 --> 24:41.924
what I've been told. You
know, I'm not perfect,

24:41.959 --> 24:44.226
but for the most part I make good grades,

24:44.261 --> 24:47.863
I haven't done anything crazy to my hair...

24:47.898 --> 24:50.016
Lately. Never been arrested.

24:50.050 --> 24:51.067
(Chuckles)

24:51.101 --> 24:54.804
And ever since the whole switch thing,

24:54.838 --> 24:57.673
my parents have relied on me,

24:57.708 --> 25:00.609
more than ever, to be that guy.

25:02.679 --> 25:05.348
But you...

25:05.382 --> 25:08.150
are so brave, going after what you want

25:08.185 --> 25:10.419
even if other people don't understand it.

25:10.454 --> 25:13.389
And it's made me want to do that too.

25:14.992 --> 25:16.892
And what I want...

25:19.863 --> 25:21.063
is you.

25:22.899 --> 25:26.635
<i>* I want to love *</i>

25:26.653 --> 25:29.705
<i>* with no fear. *</i>

25:33.543 --> 25:35.511
Now what?

25:35.545 --> 25:39.448
(Sighs) I'm not here to yell at you.

25:40.817 --> 25:44.520
Angelo has been trying to reach you.

25:44.554 --> 25:47.356
He wanted me to tell
you that Regina's okay.

25:48.392 --> 25:49.592
What does that mean?

25:49.626 --> 25:53.195
I guess she spent the night there.

25:53.230 --> 25:55.097
At Angelo's?

25:55.132 --> 25:56.966
Why?

25:57.000 --> 25:58.401
I just assumed she was at Zane's.

25:58.435 --> 26:01.337
He said that she showed up late and...

26:03.040 --> 26:04.140
had had a few.

26:09.112 --> 26:11.714
She told me that she was dealing with it.

26:14.084 --> 26:16.986
She probably believed it when she said it.

26:18.789 --> 26:21.524
I guess one of us should go get her.

26:23.693 --> 26:26.262
Maybe we should both go.

26:31.368 --> 26:33.369
- Where is she?
- She's sleeping.

26:33.403 --> 26:36.005
- Can we see her?
- No no,

26:36.039 --> 26:38.007
I don't think she wants
to see anybody right now.

26:38.041 --> 26:40.910
She needs to be home. I
need to take care of her.

26:40.944 --> 26:43.846
No, you don't, neither of
you. I'll take care of it.

26:43.880 --> 26:46.048
- Angelo...
- I'll make some calls, figure things out.

26:46.083 --> 26:48.150
And when she's better,
I'll take her back home.

26:48.185 --> 26:50.019
Then we can all come up with a plan.

26:53.790 --> 26:56.792
- Okay.
- If you want to do something,

26:56.827 --> 26:58.727
get her car back from the club.

26:58.762 --> 27:00.863
Her purse is in the kitchen.

27:06.703 --> 27:08.704
Is there anything I can do?

27:08.738 --> 27:10.573
Actually there is one thing...

27:10.607 --> 27:12.441
for me.

27:12.476 --> 27:14.543
<i>Oh. (Car approaches)</i>

27:16.379 --> 27:19.348
- Should I help you?
- Nope, I'm fine.

27:19.382 --> 27:21.951
Gonna be fine.

27:21.985 --> 27:24.019
So where is this doctor's appointment?

27:24.053 --> 27:27.089
Slight change of plans: We are
meeting my doctor at the hospital.

27:30.093 --> 27:31.894
Are you having the baby?

27:31.928 --> 27:34.096
I've been having contractions
for the past three hours...

27:34.164 --> 27:36.799
10 minutes in-between, so it's not dire.

27:36.913 --> 27:38.914
Bay, don't panic.

27:38.949 --> 27:42.851
Don't run any red lights.
Just get me to the hospital.

27:42.886 --> 27:44.870
- Okay?
- Okay.

27:44.921 --> 27:46.855
This day just keeps on coming.

27:54.453 --> 27:56.287
(moans softly)

28:01.360 --> 28:03.094
Mom?

28:06.065 --> 28:08.132
What are you doing here?

28:08.167 --> 28:10.902
Aren't you supposed to be in Puerto Rico?

28:10.936 --> 28:12.937
Angelo called me.

28:12.972 --> 28:14.806
He said you were in trouble,

28:14.840 --> 28:16.040
- I came home.
- (Sighs)

28:16.075 --> 28:18.643
He shouldn't done that. I'm fine.

28:18.677 --> 28:20.745
(Snuffles)

28:20.779 --> 28:22.580
Where is he?

28:22.615 --> 28:23.781
<i>He went to get us some lunch.</i>

28:23.816 --> 28:25.783
(Groans) Food.

28:25.818 --> 28:29.687
And you're obviously not fine.

28:29.722 --> 28:32.457
It's a hangover, I'll survive.

28:32.491 --> 28:34.659
You should go back to Puerto Rico.

28:34.693 --> 28:36.561
Oh.

28:36.595 --> 28:39.197
I wish you would have talked to me.

28:39.231 --> 28:41.165
What would you have done?

28:41.200 --> 28:43.501
Waved your magic wand

28:43.569 --> 28:46.237
<i>- and given me my life back?
- No.</i>

28:46.271 --> 28:48.973
You went through this once before alone.

28:49.008 --> 28:51.876
You don't have to this
time. We're all here for you.

28:51.910 --> 28:54.078
Great, that's just what
I need, an audience...

28:54.113 --> 28:58.683
my mom, my ex, my daughters
and my flawless co-parents.

28:58.717 --> 29:00.952
Welcome, everybody, to
Regina's failure theater!

29:00.986 --> 29:02.754
<i>(Whispers) Mi Amor.</i>

29:06.558 --> 29:08.860
No one thinks you're a failure.

29:12.865 --> 29:15.333
(Crying) I do.

29:20.673 --> 29:24.342
Angelo has arranged for you
to go to a clinic in Minnesota.

29:26.512 --> 29:29.013
You'll get all the help you need,

29:29.048 --> 29:32.984
and we'll be there whenever you want us.

29:34.153 --> 29:36.154
- Rehab?
- Yes.

29:37.256 --> 29:39.190
<i>- (Door opens)
- Wow.</i>

29:39.224 --> 29:41.092
<i>(Door closes)</i>

29:43.862 --> 29:45.963
Is everything okay?

29:45.998 --> 29:48.633
Um, I'm gonna go take a shower.

29:55.474 --> 29:57.709
Thank you. I'm glad you called me.

29:58.744 --> 30:01.279
I knew you were the one she needed.

30:05.184 --> 30:07.218
(Phone vibrates)

30:10.489 --> 30:13.024
Um, I need to go. Can you stay with her?

30:13.058 --> 30:15.059
Of course.

30:15.094 --> 30:16.928
I'll be back.

30:16.962 --> 30:19.030
I know you will.

30:24.837 --> 30:26.037

30:48.494 --> 30:50.261
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:50.295 --> 30:52.430
Uh,

30:52.464 --> 30:56.067
your staff is kinda wondering
what you're doing in here.

30:56.101 --> 30:58.002
(Groans) Yeah well,

30:58.036 --> 31:00.071
I am trying to write an acceptance speech.

31:00.105 --> 31:02.206
- You need some help?
- Yeah.

31:02.241 --> 31:04.041
Could you write it, deliver it

31:04.076 --> 31:06.043
- and take my place?
- Come on.

31:08.847 --> 31:10.915
Okay, John, what's going on?

31:10.949 --> 31:13.584
You know, when the poll
numbers started to drop,

31:13.602 --> 31:15.520
I was actually relieved.

31:16.588 --> 31:18.689
And this win? This... I didn't win this.

31:18.724 --> 31:19.790
It's like a forfeit.

31:19.808 --> 31:21.626
Nope, it's still in the "W" column.

31:23.462 --> 31:26.631
Look, I have to believe, after
everything we've been through,

31:26.665 --> 31:30.168
that things work out the
way they're supposed to.

31:31.303 --> 31:33.204
I should have pushed for you.

31:34.506 --> 31:37.375
- The party wasn't buying me.
- We should've done it anyway.

31:37.409 --> 31:39.143
(Sighs)

31:39.178 --> 31:41.879
Second-guessing isn't
helpful right now, honey.

31:41.914 --> 31:44.882
Anyway, this isn't about you or me.

31:44.917 --> 31:47.151
It's about the people you represent.

31:47.169 --> 31:49.754
You get to help make decisions that could

31:49.788 --> 31:51.689
change people's lives for the good.

31:51.723 --> 31:53.891
And that's really cool.

31:53.926 --> 31:56.994
- Yeah, it's pretty cool.
- Yeah, so come on.

31:57.029 --> 31:59.831
Let's do this later and go out
and celebrate with your staff.

31:59.865 --> 32:02.700
(Sighs)

32:02.734 --> 32:05.503
Hey! You have to listen to me.

32:05.537 --> 32:07.471
I'm one of your constituents now.

32:07.506 --> 32:09.540
(Chuckles) Yes, I do. Get over here.

32:18.116 --> 32:19.350
Thank you.

32:24.289 --> 32:26.224
Senator.

32:26.258 --> 32:29.227
Senator? You like that?

32:29.261 --> 32:31.162
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

32:31.196 --> 32:34.131

32:46.812 --> 32:49.513
(Exhales)

32:49.548 --> 32:51.449
Thanks for staying.

32:51.483 --> 32:53.484
I know it's pretty intense.

32:53.518 --> 32:56.487
Hey, it's easier for me than

32:56.521 --> 33:00.191
it is for you. Angelo
should be here any minute.

33:00.225 --> 33:01.425
Uh, I'm gonna get you more ice.

33:01.460 --> 33:03.361
- Is there anything else that you need?
- Huh-uh.

33:04.496 --> 33:06.397
Bay?

33:06.431 --> 33:09.967
He's been a good dad to you, hasn't he?

33:10.002 --> 33:12.069
<i>I mean since he found you?</i>

33:14.239 --> 33:16.941
Do you think that he
would be a good father?

33:16.975 --> 33:18.910
To her?

33:19.912 --> 33:21.779
Are you gonna keep the baby?

33:22.848 --> 33:24.782
I can't give her up

33:24.816 --> 33:26.784
unless he signs away his rights,

33:26.818 --> 33:29.387
which he won't do.

33:29.421 --> 33:31.622
I don't know what to do.

33:32.658 --> 33:35.226
But I need to know that he is reliable

33:35.260 --> 33:39.096
because I can't do this on my own.

33:39.131 --> 33:41.265
He's been trying really hard.

33:42.401 --> 33:45.102
He's actually come through a lot lately.

33:45.137 --> 33:47.338
The only reason he's not here right
now is because he's with Regina.

33:49.975 --> 33:51.943
She started drinking again

33:51.977 --> 33:53.878
and he took care of everything.

33:53.912 --> 33:55.913
Okay, so...

33:57.649 --> 33:59.784
they're, like, still in each other's lives?

33:59.818 --> 34:02.520
Yeah, uh,

34:02.554 --> 34:04.555
I know it sounds crazy, but I guess...

34:04.589 --> 34:05.923
<i>(Footsteps)... even after all of this,</i>

34:05.958 --> 34:07.808
- those two are...
- Sorry I'm late.

34:07.859 --> 34:09.659
How are you doing?

34:09.695 --> 34:11.696
I'm hanging in there.

34:13.665 --> 34:16.534
Well, I'm gonna let you
two share in all of this.

34:16.568 --> 34:18.235
Uh...

34:18.270 --> 34:22.106
I'm gonna be in the lobby
if you need anything.

34:29.281 --> 34:31.232
You got everything?

34:31.283 --> 34:33.083
I think so.

34:38.106 --> 34:40.190
The train leaves at 4:00, right?

34:41.226 --> 34:44.762
Yeah, grandma's already in the car.

34:49.034 --> 34:53.536

34:53.572 --> 34:54.855

34:57.676 --> 34:58.909
Well...

35:00.579 --> 35:02.646
I'm going to see you?

35:02.681 --> 35:05.649
Yeah. They have assigned family days.

35:05.684 --> 35:08.519
And until then...

35:08.553 --> 35:11.305
we can't text or email?

35:12.324 --> 35:13.591
No.

35:13.625 --> 35:17.294
<i>* and I look to you... *</i>

35:17.329 --> 35:20.297
- I'm so sorry.
- For what?

35:21.967 --> 35:23.868
I know you had to stop signing,

35:23.902 --> 35:27.038
it wasn't a choice, but I kept my distance.

35:28.240 --> 35:30.841
I let things change between us.

35:30.876 --> 35:33.911
And you think my drinking was your fault?

35:33.945 --> 35:36.747
If I had noticed,

35:36.782 --> 35:38.933
been paying closer attention...

35:38.967 --> 35:41.852
- I mean, Bay noticed.
- Honey,

35:41.870 --> 35:45.756
no one is responsible for
my drinking except for me.

35:45.791 --> 35:48.392
Do you understand?

35:54.399 --> 35:56.600
I know I lied to you

35:56.635 --> 35:58.502
and I am so sorry.

35:58.537 --> 36:00.571
I forgot,

36:00.605 --> 36:05.109

to fight for every single day.

I saw Angelo holding the baby,

39:27.421 --> 39:30.122
