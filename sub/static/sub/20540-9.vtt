[cheers and applause]

00:40.367 --> 00:43.867
- Welcome, welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight."

00:43.867 --> 00:45.000
I'm John Oliver.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.367
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:46.367 --> 00:48.533
Just time for a quick recap
of the week.

00:48.533 --> 00:50.900
And we begin
with President Trump,

00:50.900 --> 00:53.300
two words that give you
a sense of impending doom,

00:53.300 --> 00:57.667
like "sewage enema"
or "United Airlines."

00:57.667 --> 01:00.200
But this week
saw a spectacular moment,

01:00.200 --> 01:02.233
when White House spokesman
Sean Spicer

01:02.233 --> 01:04.367
attempted to explain
our stance on Syria

01:04.367 --> 01:06.166
by pointing to the fact
Assad had used

01:06.166 --> 01:08.000
chemical weapons
on his own people.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.767
Not that difficult a thing
to explain.

01:09.767 --> 01:13.367
Certainly very difficult
to explain this badly.

01:13.367 --> 01:14.700
- You look.

01:14.700 --> 01:17.400
We didn't use chemical weapons
in World War II.

01:17.400 --> 01:19.900
You know, you had a--

01:19.900 --> 01:22.467
you know, uh, someone
as despicable as Hitler,

01:22.467 --> 01:24.967
who didn't even sink
to the--to the--

01:24.967 --> 01:26.700
to using chemical weapons.

01:26.700 --> 01:30.500
- Yes, Hitler
didn't use chemical weapons.

01:30.500 --> 01:31.834
That's not just wrong;

01:31.834 --> 01:35.066
that's $200 question
on "Jeopardy" wrong.

01:35.066 --> 01:38.500
That is "Wheel of Fortune"
First Round Toss-Up wrong.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.934
Because everybody knows

01:40.934 --> 01:44.633
mass chemical extermination
was kind of Hitler's thing,

01:44.633 --> 01:46.033
that and the mustache.

01:46.033 --> 01:47.567
You take them away,
and all you've got

01:47.567 --> 01:51.033
is an ill-tempered Austrian
with resting bitch face.

01:51.033 --> 01:53.333
And--and Spicer's comments

01:53.333 --> 01:56.300
led to this incredible
follow-up question.

01:56.300 --> 01:57.600
- Just want to give you
the opportunity to clarify

01:57.600 --> 01:58.867
something you said
that seems to be gaining

01:58.867 --> 02:00.166
some traction right now.

02:00.166 --> 02:02.533
Uh, "Hitler didn't even sink
to the level

02:02.533 --> 02:04.767
of using chemical weapons."

02:04.767 --> 02:06.033
What did you mean by that?

02:06.033 --> 02:07.700
- I think when you come
to sarin gas,

02:07.700 --> 02:10.834
uh, there was no--
he was not using the gas

02:10.834 --> 02:14.400
on his own people the same way
that Assad is doing.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.734
I mean, there was clearly--

02:15.734 --> 02:17.667
uh, I--I understand your point.
Thank you.

02:17.667 --> 02:19.133
I--thank you.
I appreciate that.

02:19.133 --> 02:21.600
There was--not in the--
in the--

02:21.600 --> 02:24.100
he brought 'em into the--
to, um--

02:24.100 --> 02:25.934
to the Holocaust Center.
I understand that.

02:25.934 --> 02:28.533
- At no point during that

02:28.533 --> 02:31.367
was he in control
of his own mouth.

02:31.367 --> 02:34.066
Most specifically, the moment
he suddenly decided to

02:34.066 --> 02:36.734
coin the term
"Holocaust Center,"

02:36.734 --> 02:40.266
which sounds like the home arena
for an alt-right hockey team.

02:40.266 --> 02:42.800
But wait, wait,
'cause he wasn't done.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.633
Spicer then put out
a printed statement,

02:44.633 --> 02:47.033
reading, "In no way
was I trying to lessen

02:47.033 --> 02:48.834
the horrendous nature
of the Holocaust,"

02:48.834 --> 02:52.033
which is an amazing way
to start any statement.

02:52.033 --> 02:53.567
Continuing, "However,

02:53.567 --> 02:55.467
"I was trying to draw
a contrast of

02:55.467 --> 02:56.967
"the tactic of using airplanes

02:56.967 --> 02:59.567
to drop chemical weapons
on innocent people."

02:59.567 --> 03:01.667
The problem there is,
that could imply

03:01.667 --> 03:03.100
the victims of the Holocaust

03:03.100 --> 03:04.934
were not innocent people,

03:04.934 --> 03:07.900
hence Spicer's hastily
released second statement,

03:07.900 --> 03:11.033
changing "innocent people"
to "population centers,"

03:11.033 --> 03:13.500
then a third statement
with an extra line saying,

03:13.500 --> 03:14.900
"Any attack on innocent people

03:14.900 --> 03:17.400
is reprehensible
and inexcusable."

03:17.400 --> 03:20.467
And then a final statement
which read, in its entirety,

03:20.467 --> 03:22.734
"Hello. I can't stop
making statements.

03:22.734 --> 03:24.767
"I don't want to make
any more statements.

03:24.767 --> 03:29.367
Can anybody hear me?
Hitler, Hitler, Hitler. Sean."

03:29.367 --> 03:31.867
Meanwhile--meanwhile,

03:31.867 --> 03:34.967
the president himself was being
interviewed about Syria,

03:34.967 --> 03:37.266
where he described
in surprising detail

03:37.266 --> 03:40.000
the moment that he informed
Chinese president Xi Jinping

03:40.000 --> 03:42.200
that the strikes
would be taking place.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.400
- I was sitting at the table.
We had finished dinner.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.600
We're now having dessert.

03:46.600 --> 03:49.066
And we had the most beautiful
piece of chocolate cake

03:49.066 --> 03:50.433
that you've ever seen.

03:50.433 --> 03:54.433
And President Xi
was enjoying it.

03:54.433 --> 03:59.200
And I was given the message
from the generals

03:59.200 --> 04:02.533
that the ships
are locked and loaded.

04:02.533 --> 04:04.033
What do you do?

04:04.033 --> 04:06.333
And we made
a determination to do.

04:06.333 --> 04:09.500
- Only Donald Trump could use
a conversation about

04:09.500 --> 04:11.133
missile strikes
in the Middle East

04:11.133 --> 04:13.967
to advertise the cake
at Mar-a-Lago,

04:13.967 --> 04:15.300
which, by the way,
you might

04:15.300 --> 04:16.667
want to think twice
about trying,

04:16.667 --> 04:18.266
given that, just this week,
it was reported

04:18.266 --> 04:22.200
the club's kitchen was cited
for 13 health code violations

04:22.200 --> 04:23.767
for, among other things,

04:23.767 --> 04:26.767
fish that had not undergone
proper parasite destruction

04:26.767 --> 04:30.200
and storing ham at 57 degrees,

04:30.200 --> 04:32.900
because nothing says
upscale dining

04:32.900 --> 04:37.266
like lukewarm ham
with a side of tapeworm.

04:37.266 --> 04:38.700
And if you're thinking,
"Well, hold on,

04:38.700 --> 04:40.300
"perhaps the president
brought up the cake

04:40.300 --> 04:42.500
"because he wanted to be
extra precise

04:42.500 --> 04:44.433
about every single detail,"

04:44.433 --> 04:46.200
well, let's rejoin
that interview

04:46.200 --> 04:48.433
just one minute later.

04:48.433 --> 04:50.200
- So what happens is, I said,

04:50.200 --> 04:53.800
"We've just launched
59 missiles,

04:53.800 --> 04:55.100
heading to Iraq."

04:55.100 --> 04:56.567
- Well, you--headed to Syria.

04:56.567 --> 04:59.333
- Yes, heading toward Syria.

04:59.333 --> 05:02.734
- I honestly wish
she'd just kept naming places

05:02.734 --> 05:04.800
to see if he kept agreeing
with her.

05:04.800 --> 05:07.533
"Headed to Egypt?"
"Yes, headed to Egypt."

05:07.533 --> 05:10.500
"Headed to Dollywood?"
"Yes, headed to Dollywood."

05:10.500 --> 05:11.800
"Headed straight for us?"

05:11.800 --> 05:14.800
"Yes, headed straight for us
right now."

05:14.800 --> 05:16.400
Now, as we mentioned last week,

05:16.400 --> 05:18.867
the bigger issue with Trump's
sudden bombing of Syria is,

05:18.867 --> 05:21.633
it runs directly counter to
everything he'd said previously,

05:21.633 --> 05:22.867
through tweets like,

05:22.867 --> 05:25.967
"What I am saying
is stay out of Syria."

05:25.967 --> 05:28.100
But it turned out
that was just a warm-up

05:28.100 --> 05:31.333
for a week full of
foreign policy flip-flops.

05:31.333 --> 05:33.934
- President Trump making
a number of stunning reversals,

05:33.934 --> 05:36.700
as he faces multiple
foreign policy crises.

05:36.700 --> 05:38.967
After repeatedly
calling NATO obsolete

05:38.967 --> 05:40.300
on the campaign trail...

05:40.300 --> 05:42.266
- NATO, in my opinion,
is obsolete.

05:42.266 --> 05:44.567
- Now Mr. Trump,
changing his tone...

05:44.567 --> 05:46.433
- I said it was obsolete.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.200
It's no longer obsolete.

05:48.200 --> 05:51.367
- It is incredibly annoying

05:51.367 --> 05:53.567
how long it took Donald Trump
to reach a conclusion

05:53.567 --> 05:56.066
that everyone else
had already reached.

05:56.066 --> 05:59.533
It's like a flat-Earther finally
admitting the Earth is round.

05:59.533 --> 06:02.367
Yes, you are finally right,
but I'm still mad at you

06:02.367 --> 06:06.166
that you ever believed
that shit in the first place.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.800
And that's just the beginning.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.500
He also U-turned on calling
China a "currency manipulator,"

06:10.500 --> 06:12.734
replacing
Fed. Chair Janet Yellen,

06:12.734 --> 06:15.533
and his criticisms
of the Export-Import Bank.

06:15.533 --> 06:17.700
And you may be happy
with those reversals,

06:17.700 --> 06:19.567
but if you are
a Trump supporter,

06:19.567 --> 06:21.467
you might be
rightly pissed off.

06:21.467 --> 06:23.900
This is not
what you thought you bought.

06:23.900 --> 06:26.233
It's like getting tickets
for "The Vagina Monologues,"

06:26.233 --> 06:29.433
but on the night you went,
it starred Brian Dennehy,

06:29.433 --> 06:31.667
who's great--
look, don't get me wrong--

06:31.667 --> 06:35.233
but he's not really
what you signed up for.

06:35.233 --> 06:38.500
And sometimes Trump's 180s
seem to happen in real-time.

06:38.500 --> 06:40.066
For instance,
his longstanding belief

06:40.066 --> 06:42.867
that North Korea could easily
be taken care of by China

06:42.867 --> 06:44.266
apparently changed

06:44.266 --> 06:47.166
moments after he brought it up
to Xi Jinping.

06:47.166 --> 06:48.734
- "Mr. Xi then explained

06:48.734 --> 06:52.433
the history of China and Korea,"
Mr. Trump said.

06:52.433 --> 06:54.300
"After listening
for ten minutes," he said,

06:54.300 --> 06:56.834
"I realize it's not so easy."

06:56.834 --> 06:58.533
[laughter]

06:58.533 --> 07:01.934
- Xi Jinping got him
to completely change his mind

07:01.934 --> 07:04.300
after just ten minutes.

07:04.300 --> 07:06.667
And how did he even explain
something that complicated

07:06.667 --> 07:08.100
in so short a time?

07:08.100 --> 07:09.867
I genuinely want to know that,

07:09.867 --> 07:12.500
because if this show
did a segment on grapes,

07:12.500 --> 07:14.166
we'd need 20 minutes

07:14.166 --> 07:17.233
and an appearance
from a marching band.

07:17.233 --> 07:19.033
The president seems
to change his mind

07:19.033 --> 07:21.433
based on any information
that is new to him,

07:21.433 --> 07:24.100
which seems to be
almost any information,

07:24.100 --> 07:26.033
and that is genuinely worrying.

07:26.033 --> 07:28.767
We have a leader operating
on a learner's permit,

07:28.767 --> 07:31.033
and we were reminded
just this week

07:31.033 --> 07:34.000
of what a president
has at his disposal.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.467
- We learned a short time ago,

07:35.467 --> 07:37.500
for the first time in combat,

07:37.500 --> 07:41.266
the U.S. military dropped
a 21,000-pound bomb

07:41.266 --> 07:43.533
in eastern Afghanistan.

07:43.533 --> 07:45.900
Inside the Air Force,
inside the military,

07:45.900 --> 07:48.834
it quite seriously
is referred to

07:48.834 --> 07:51.400
as "the mother of all bombs."

07:51.400 --> 07:53.767
- Okay, now, there is obviously
a lot to unpack there,

07:53.767 --> 07:55.900
but let's just take a minute
and appreciate the fact

07:55.900 --> 07:57.533
that we finally
reached a point

07:57.533 --> 07:59.533
where mothers
can be bombs too.

07:59.533 --> 08:02.867
#MOMBOMBS, #FEMINISM.

08:02.867 --> 08:07.000
But minutes after
that historic bomb drop,

08:07.000 --> 08:10.033
Trump took a victory lap
that was tripped up slightly

08:10.033 --> 08:13.066
by one very simple question.

08:13.066 --> 08:15.033
- We are so proud
of our military,

08:15.033 --> 08:18.367
and it was another
successful event.

08:19.900 --> 08:23.233
- Uh, everybody knows
exactly what happened, so...

08:23.233 --> 08:25.667
And what I do is,
I authorize my military.

08:25.667 --> 08:27.467
We have the greatest military
in the world,

08:27.467 --> 08:29.166
and they've done a job,
as usual,

08:29.166 --> 08:32.166
so we have given them
total authorization.

08:32.166 --> 08:34.700
- What the fuck was that?

08:34.700 --> 08:36.500
That was a yes-or-no question,

08:36.500 --> 08:38.400
to which you vomited 38 words,

08:38.400 --> 08:40.533
none of which were yes or no,

08:40.533 --> 08:41.934
although to be fair,

08:41.934 --> 08:43.734
none of them
were "Holocaust Center" either,

08:43.734 --> 08:47.100
so I guess we should be
at least partially relieved.

08:47.100 --> 08:48.867
And incidentally,
later reports suggest

08:48.867 --> 08:51.133
that the U.S. commander
who ordered the bomb drop

08:51.133 --> 08:53.100
didn't need and didn't request

08:53.100 --> 08:54.767
President Trump's approval,

08:54.767 --> 08:56.000
which means Trump has placed

08:56.000 --> 08:58.367
a significant amount
of authority

08:58.367 --> 09:00.133
in the hands of his commanders.

09:00.133 --> 09:01.533
And you may think that's good,

09:01.533 --> 09:02.934
you may think that's bad,

09:02.934 --> 09:04.333
but I would not expect Trump

09:04.333 --> 09:06.100
to curb that power
any time soon,

09:06.100 --> 09:08.166
because, as we talked about
last week,

09:08.166 --> 09:10.300
this is a man
who responds to praise,

09:10.300 --> 09:13.133
and yet again,
he's being praised for this.

09:13.133 --> 09:15.333
Just watch Trump's
favorite morning show,

09:15.333 --> 09:18.033
"Fox & Friends,"
respond to the bombing.

09:18.033 --> 09:20.433
- ♪ Uncle Sam put your name ♪

09:20.433 --> 09:22.533
♪ At the top of his list ♪

09:26.600 --> 09:28.100

- Good morning.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.100
- But that is what
freedom looks like.

09:30.100 --> 09:31.567
That's the red, white,
and blue.

09:31.567 --> 09:33.266
- Well, one of
my favorite things

09:33.266 --> 09:34.734
in the 16 years
I've been here at Fox News

09:34.734 --> 09:36.967
is watching bombs
drop on bad guys.

09:36.967 --> 09:38.633
- Oh, that's a coincidence,

09:38.633 --> 09:40.033
because one
of my favorite things

09:40.033 --> 09:41.300
in four seasons on this show

09:41.300 --> 09:43.166
is getting to look
directly into the camera

09:43.166 --> 09:44.800
and say, "Fuck you, Geraldo.

09:44.800 --> 09:47.300
I hope your mustache
gets caught in a box fan."

09:47.300 --> 09:49.800
Oh!
Oh! That felt amazing.

09:49.800 --> 09:52.467
That felt absolutely amazing.

09:52.467 --> 09:54.133
But Geraldo wasn't done.

09:54.133 --> 09:55.533
He had strategic advice

09:55.533 --> 09:58.567
for the man who was
almost certainly watching.

09:58.567 --> 09:59.934
- It's not gonna win the war,

09:59.934 --> 10:01.333
but it certainly
sends a message.

10:01.333 --> 10:04.934
The message has to be,
"We're coming for you."

10:04.934 --> 10:06.900
You know, I--I had a bully
in high school,

10:06.900 --> 10:08.233
a guy named Richie.

10:08.233 --> 10:09.834
You never knew
what Richie was gonna do.

10:09.834 --> 10:12.567
Richie had a--a--you know, a--
he'd have a temper.

10:12.567 --> 10:15.100
Sometimes he'd wanna kill ya,
and sometimes he'd let you go.

10:15.100 --> 10:17.667
I like that they think
that Donald Trump is like

10:17.667 --> 10:19.100
Richie from my high school.

10:19.100 --> 10:20.300
I want the bad guys to think

10:20.300 --> 10:22.567
that he could do
anything to them...

10:22.567 --> 10:24.200
- Unpredictable.
- At any--any moment,

10:24.200 --> 10:26.967
and I think that
that has a positive impact.

10:26.967 --> 10:29.133
- Holy shit.

10:29.133 --> 10:31.567
You see, this is why
bullying never works.

10:31.567 --> 10:33.734
If you have a bully in school,
there is a good chance

10:33.734 --> 10:36.734
he's turning some kid
into the next Geraldo Rivera.

10:36.734 --> 10:38.233
And if you have a bully
in the White House,

10:38.233 --> 10:39.934
he does violent,
impulsive things

10:39.934 --> 10:42.734
that seem to be inching us
closer to, among other things,

10:42.734 --> 10:45.300
potential nuclear war
with North Korea.

10:45.300 --> 10:46.867
And if that happens,

10:46.867 --> 10:50.066
it's gonna take a fucking
amazing piece of chocolate cake

10:50.066 --> 10:52.133
to help us forget about it.

10:52.133 --> 10:53.900
And now, this.

10:53.900 --> 10:55.300
male announcer: And now...

11:00.166 --> 11:01.633
- We've got
an Easter egg hunt

11:01.633 --> 11:03.600
that is said to be
egg-cellent.

11:03.600 --> 11:06.934
- So you'd better hop on over
to the Lincoln Park Zoo.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.500
- Well, hop-pening
this weekend,

11:08.500 --> 11:09.900
one event in the Northland

11:09.900 --> 11:12.834
is sure to "egg-cellent"
for the entire family.

11:12.834 --> 11:14.867
- The egg-cellent details
when I see you for

11:14.867 --> 11:17.667
"Eyewitness News"
at 7:00 on WYOU.

11:17.667 --> 11:18.867
- Hope it's all that
it's cracked up to be.

11:18.867 --> 11:20.266
[laughter]

11:20.266 --> 11:21.667
- They're out here
with their parents

11:21.667 --> 11:24.266
getting some of those, uh,
egg-cellent goodies.

11:24.266 --> 11:25.567
- You bet your bonnet

11:25.567 --> 11:27.834
we have a plethora
of egg-citing events.

11:27.834 --> 11:29.767
- This Minnesota restaurant
is gearing up for Easter

11:29.767 --> 11:31.934
with this egg-cellent
tradition, they say.

11:31.934 --> 11:33.500
Notice the play on
the word "egg."

11:33.500 --> 11:36.467
- An egg-cellent wild card pick.
See what I did there?

11:36.467 --> 11:38.900
- I bet you're wondering
what's hopping over here.

11:38.900 --> 11:41.333
- Thanks, José, sounds like
an egg-citing time.

11:41.333 --> 11:42.600
- Kids will be able
to trade that in

11:42.600 --> 11:44.834
for an eggs-tra special treat.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.633
both: Oh!

11:46.633 --> 11:48.066
- That was good.
- I saw what you did there.

11:48.066 --> 11:49.467
- Great job there.

11:49.467 --> 11:52.633
- That--it was written
in the script that way.

11:52.633 --> 11:53.834
- Moving on.

11:53.834 --> 11:56.367
Our main story tonight
concerns France,

11:56.367 --> 11:58.533
home of Babar,
the lovable elephant

11:58.533 --> 11:59.767
who becomes less lovable

11:59.767 --> 12:01.033
when you remember that
in the books,

12:01.033 --> 12:03.166
he married his cousin;
that's right.

12:03.166 --> 12:07.266
Your childhood elephant hero
was a cousin fucker.

12:07.266 --> 12:09.367
The point is, next Sunday,

12:09.367 --> 12:11.867
France holds the first round
of its presidential election,

12:11.867 --> 12:13.200
and if you're thinking,

12:13.200 --> 12:14.633
"Well, why should I care
about that?"

12:14.633 --> 12:16.967
The truth is,
it is way more important

12:16.967 --> 12:18.834
than you might realize.

12:18.834 --> 12:20.600
- It's a very important
election,

12:20.600 --> 12:22.333
what's going to happen
in France.

12:22.333 --> 12:24.834
It's the future of Europe,
basically.

12:24.834 --> 12:27.233
- Overwhelmingly, France
is the election that matters.

12:27.233 --> 12:28.867
- Well, these French elections
take place

12:28.867 --> 12:32.400
at the crossroad
of European history.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.867
It's really defining
Europe's fate.

12:34.867 --> 12:36.333
- That's right.

12:36.333 --> 12:38.166
The fate of Europe
rests in the hands of a country

12:38.166 --> 12:39.967
that looks at snails
and says,

12:39.967 --> 12:43.734
"I have got to get you
in my mouth."

12:43.734 --> 12:46.767
But it is not an exaggeration
to say that, post-Brexit,

12:46.767 --> 12:49.800
and with a wave of far-right
populism sweeping Europe,

12:49.800 --> 12:52.700
the fate of the EU
may hang on this election.

12:52.700 --> 12:55.166
Multiple candidates support
a French Brexit,

12:55.166 --> 12:58.333
and the consequences of that
would be steep.

12:58.333 --> 12:59.867
- And frankly,
it's not bragging,

12:59.867 --> 13:02.767
but if France is out of the EU,
it's the end of the EU

13:02.767 --> 13:04.667
and the end of
the eurozone,

13:04.667 --> 13:06.633
uh, so a lot of things
will depend on

13:06.633 --> 13:08.500
the result
of the French elections.

13:08.500 --> 13:09.767
- It's true.

13:09.767 --> 13:11.100
This could be
the most disastrous

13:11.100 --> 13:12.500
French exit in history,

13:12.500 --> 13:14.667
and that is acknowledging
that a "French exit"

13:14.667 --> 13:17.533
normally refers to drinking
an entire bottle of red wine

13:17.533 --> 13:20.266
and then leaving the party
with the host's wife.

13:20.266 --> 13:23.367
So--so this is
a critical election,

13:23.367 --> 13:26.433
or technically,
two critical elections.

13:26.433 --> 13:28.767
- The election takes place
in two rounds,

13:28.767 --> 13:32.533
one on April the 23rd,
the next on May the 7th.

13:32.533 --> 13:33.900
The first round will see

13:33.900 --> 13:35.900
all the candidates
compete for votes.

13:35.900 --> 13:38.000
In the second, assuming
nobody got more than

13:38.000 --> 13:39.934
half the votes
in the first round,

13:39.934 --> 13:42.300
the top two contenders
will face off.

13:42.300 --> 13:44.433
- What a ridiculous system.

13:44.433 --> 13:46.600
Where are
the 51 individual contests

13:46.600 --> 13:49.000
that allot points based on
outdated demographic data

13:49.000 --> 13:50.400
that can result in
a decisive loser

13:50.400 --> 13:52.200
in the popular vote count
somehow winning?

13:52.200 --> 13:54.000
That's just stupid!

13:54.000 --> 13:56.367
Well, go easy on France.

13:56.367 --> 14:00.266
They're still working out
the kinks in their democracy.

14:00.266 --> 14:04.300
And this--this election comes
at a time of great volatility.

14:04.300 --> 14:07.000
France has suffered a string
of major terror attacks,

14:07.000 --> 14:09.367
their unemployment rate
is hovering around 10%,

14:09.367 --> 14:11.433
and their current president,
François Hollande,

14:11.433 --> 14:14.767
isn't even running,
for a pretty good reason.

14:14.767 --> 14:16.133
- The latest opinion polls
have come out.

14:16.133 --> 14:18.700
Uh, François Hollande,
he's at an all-time low.

14:18.700 --> 14:21.100
I mean, he even got close
to zero here, didn't he?

14:21.100 --> 14:23.533
- Get ready for it--
according to this poll,

14:23.533 --> 14:28.734
only 4% of French people
are satisfied by

14:28.734 --> 14:30.166
François Hollande's presidency.
- Wow.

14:30.166 --> 14:31.266
- 4%.

14:31.266 --> 14:33.033
- 4%!

14:33.033 --> 14:35.500
To put that in perspective,
apparently the very lowest

14:35.500 --> 14:37.600
album score
in Metacritic's history

14:37.600 --> 14:42.166
is 15% for Kevin Federline's
"Playing with Fire,"

14:42.166 --> 14:44.300
an album about which
"Billboard" raved,

14:44.300 --> 14:47.967
"In general,
Federline enunciates well."

14:47.967 --> 14:49.734
But even without
Hollande running,

14:49.734 --> 14:52.166
his Socialist Party
is divided and struggling,

14:52.166 --> 14:55.033
with one early contender
to replace him, Manuel Valls,

14:55.033 --> 14:57.867
so widely disliked
that this happened.

14:57.867 --> 14:59.834
- [speaking French]
- It happened an hour ago

14:59.834 --> 15:01.467
in this café behind me,

15:01.467 --> 15:04.633
Café Broglie, well known
to Strasbourg residents.

15:04.633 --> 15:07.767
A man approached Manuel Valls
and threw flour at him.

15:07.767 --> 15:09.266
- [speaking French]

15:09.266 --> 15:11.433
[clamoring in French]

15:11.433 --> 15:13.033
- Look, anywhere else,

15:13.033 --> 15:15.700
it might be a bad sign
to have flour thrown at you,

15:15.700 --> 15:17.367
but in a country
where pastries have

15:17.367 --> 15:19.433
greater constitutional rights
than people,

15:19.433 --> 15:23.200
it is technically possible that
that was actually an honor.

15:23.200 --> 15:26.033
So--so who is running
for this important job?

15:26.033 --> 15:28.834
Well--well, there are actually
11 candidates at the moment,

15:28.834 --> 15:30.600
and we'll get to the main ones
in a minute,

15:30.600 --> 15:32.767
but first you're going
to want to meet

15:32.767 --> 15:34.300
some of the outsiders.

15:34.300 --> 15:36.767
There is Jacques Cheminade,
a conspiracy theorist

15:36.767 --> 15:38.567
who once said that
the Queen of England

15:38.567 --> 15:41.433
was involved in
international drug trafficking,

15:41.433 --> 15:44.400
and whose platform includes
a plan to colonize Mars,

15:44.400 --> 15:47.200
which he explained
magnificently.

15:47.200 --> 15:50.233
- [speaking French]

16:01.934 --> 16:03.066
- You're right.

16:03.066 --> 16:04.266
He just said,

16:04.266 --> 16:07.767
"Larry Skywalker
and that weird bear,"

16:07.767 --> 16:09.967
presumably meaning Chewbacca,

16:09.967 --> 16:11.967
and I really think
that should've been

16:11.967 --> 16:14.233
those characters' names
instead.

16:14.233 --> 16:16.400
"Hi, I'm Han Solo,
this is Larry,

16:16.400 --> 16:18.300
"and this is our friend,
that weird bear,

16:18.300 --> 16:20.967
or whatever the fuck he is,
I don't know."

16:20.967 --> 16:24.266
Then--then
there is Jean Lassalle,

16:24.266 --> 16:27.767
who, as you can see,
is almost offensively French.

16:27.767 --> 16:30.467
He once went on
a 39-day hunger strike

16:30.467 --> 16:32.900
to protest a threat to jobs
in his constituency.

16:32.900 --> 16:35.400
And his campaign ads
are mesmerizing.

16:35.400 --> 16:38.066
He rides on a train
in moody black-and-white,

16:38.066 --> 16:40.700
works on his farm,
dances around,

16:40.700 --> 16:43.767
and then mows a hillside
shirtless.

16:43.767 --> 16:46.567
His entire life seems like
an attempt to win

16:46.567 --> 16:50.633
the game show called
"So You Think You Can France."

16:50.633 --> 16:52.900
But the thing is,
there are currently

16:52.900 --> 16:54.700
four main candidates

16:54.700 --> 16:57.433
with a real shot at getting
to the second round.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.166
There is François Fillon,

16:59.166 --> 17:00.567
the former
French prime minister.

17:00.567 --> 17:02.400
Now, he was once
the leading candidate

17:02.400 --> 17:03.834
but has since fallen back
in the polls

17:03.834 --> 17:05.633
thanks to Penelopegate,

17:05.633 --> 17:07.400
which sounds like
a scandal involving

17:07.400 --> 17:10.166
selling weapons-grade uranium
to Penélope Cruz.

17:10.166 --> 17:11.700
But--but it actually involves

17:11.700 --> 17:14.467
Fillon allegedly paying
his wife, Penelope, and children

17:14.467 --> 17:16.734
hundreds of thousands
of euros of public money

17:16.734 --> 17:18.100
for little or no work.

17:18.100 --> 17:20.700
And the accusations
don't stop there.

17:20.700 --> 17:23.233
- There are reports he may have
breached electoral rules

17:23.233 --> 17:26.000
after receiving
a donation of two suits

17:26.000 --> 17:28.533
that together
cost 13,000 euros.

17:28.533 --> 17:31.567
- I am perfectly allowed to be
given a suit by a friend.

17:31.567 --> 17:33.367
It's not against the law.

17:33.367 --> 17:34.533
- Oh, you're right.

17:34.533 --> 17:35.934
That is a completely
normal thing

17:35.934 --> 17:37.934
for adult friends to do.

17:37.934 --> 17:39.367
Happy birthday, friend.

17:39.367 --> 17:42.834
I got you two suits
that cost about $7,000 each,

17:42.834 --> 17:44.900
because that is
a non-suspicious amount

17:44.900 --> 17:46.834
to spend on a gift
for a friend.

17:46.834 --> 17:48.633
How not weird is this?

17:48.633 --> 17:51.000
Couldn't be not weirder, right?

17:51.000 --> 17:52.967
So the French public
turned on Fillon,

17:52.967 --> 17:56.200
and you will never guess
how they expressed their anger.

17:56.200 --> 17:59.300
- Moments before
he took the stage at a rally,

17:59.300 --> 18:02.700
you'll see he was, uh,
hit in the face with some flour.

18:02.700 --> 18:05.567
We can see images of that
happening right there.

18:05.567 --> 18:07.600
Now, apparently
he had a spare suit,

18:07.600 --> 18:08.900
luckily for him.

18:08.900 --> 18:10.734
- Oh!

18:10.734 --> 18:14.900
It just doesn't look great
to whip out a brand-new suit

18:14.900 --> 18:16.300
when you've been
essentially accused of

18:16.300 --> 18:18.633
having been bribed in suits.

18:18.633 --> 18:21.367
Maybe go for a T-shirt
and shorts there.

18:21.367 --> 18:25.133
Now next, there is far-left
candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon,

18:25.133 --> 18:30.000
who is anti-EU and pro-high-tech
campaign wizardry.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.567
- Answering
the eternal question

18:31.567 --> 18:33.633
of how to be
in two places at once,

18:33.633 --> 18:35.834
presidential candidate
Jean-Luc Mélenchon

18:35.834 --> 18:37.600
has embraced holograms.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.934
- [speaking French]
- Where am I?

18:39.934 --> 18:40.934
In León.

18:40.934 --> 18:44.867
[crowd cheers]

18:44.867 --> 18:47.533
And now in Paris.

18:47.533 --> 18:50.734
[crowd cheers]

18:50.734 --> 18:52.600
- Cool.

18:52.600 --> 18:55.934
That--that was both
very lame and very costly.

18:55.934 --> 18:57.467
It's like finding out

18:57.467 --> 19:02.433
your uncle's detachable
thumb trick cost him $400,000.

19:02.433 --> 19:04.767
And that brings us to
the two current frontrunners,

19:04.767 --> 19:07.100
and first, let's deal
with Emmanuel Macron.

19:07.100 --> 19:08.600
Polls suggest
that he is the favorite

19:08.600 --> 19:10.600
to win the presidency,
which is actually impressive,

19:10.600 --> 19:13.333
considering he's never held
elected office before.

19:13.333 --> 19:14.667
He's a former banker,

19:14.667 --> 19:17.000
who served as an
economic advisor to Hollande.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.367
And if you are falling sleep

19:18.367 --> 19:20.233
just listening to me
describe him,

19:20.233 --> 19:22.033
you're not alone.

19:22.033 --> 19:25.100
- Mr. Macron,
who is neither left not right,

19:25.100 --> 19:28.133
and is generally inoffensive
to the entire population,

19:28.133 --> 19:30.900
is not super attractive
to anyone.

19:30.900 --> 19:32.400
- Ouch.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.100
He is generally inoffensive

19:34.100 --> 19:35.800
and not super attractive
to anyone.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.400
That makes him
sound like he's the guy

19:37.400 --> 19:40.467
who played the main character
on "How I Met Your Mother."

19:40.467 --> 19:45.400
This man, and this is true,
has no name.

19:45.400 --> 19:47.934
Macron has a Centrist policy

19:47.934 --> 19:49.633
that is pro-business,
pro-Europe,

19:49.633 --> 19:51.467
and aimed at boosting
France's economy,

19:51.467 --> 19:55.066
but the most interesting thing
about him might be this.

19:55.066 --> 19:59.133
- Emmanuel Macron was once
a small-town boy from Amiens,

19:59.133 --> 20:02.133
who met his future wife here
at school.

20:02.133 --> 20:05.166
The only twist is that
she was his teacher.

20:05.166 --> 20:06.867
- It's true.

20:06.867 --> 20:08.266
He married his French teacher,

20:08.266 --> 20:10.033
who is 20 years older
than him,

20:10.033 --> 20:13.166
and as a result, Macron,
a 39-year-old man,

20:13.166 --> 20:15.533
now has seven
step-grandchildren.

20:15.533 --> 20:17.834
And I'm sorry,
but a man in his 30s

20:17.834 --> 20:20.300
suddenly ending up
with seven step-grandchildren

20:20.300 --> 20:22.467
sounds like
the plot of a direct-to-DVD

20:22.467 --> 20:24.033
Ashton Kutcher movie called

20:24.033 --> 20:27.767
"Even On A Nine-Hour Flight,
This Movie Is Unwatchable."

20:27.767 --> 20:29.367
And by the way,
if you're wondering,

20:29.367 --> 20:31.467
"Did Macron
get any baking ingredient

20:31.467 --> 20:33.133
thrown at him
during the campaign?"

20:33.133 --> 20:35.200
Well, what do you think?

20:35.200 --> 20:36.934
- [speaking French]
- Ah!

20:36.934 --> 20:39.967
[all speaking French]

20:44.066 --> 20:45.367
- Emmanuel Macron

20:45.367 --> 20:47.734
just got hit in the head
with an egg.

20:48.567 --> 20:50.333
- So to recap,

20:50.333 --> 20:53.400
that is two cups of flour
and now an egg.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.433
Now, I don't know
if the French people

20:55.433 --> 20:57.000
are any closer
to picking a president,

20:57.000 --> 21:00.734
but they're about halfway
to making a decent crepe.

21:00.734 --> 21:03.600
And that--that leaves us
with Marine Le Pen,

21:03.600 --> 21:05.100
Macron's biggest challenger,

21:05.100 --> 21:06.767
and honestly,
she is the main reason

21:06.767 --> 21:09.533
you should be invested
in this election.

21:09.533 --> 21:12.700
The Le Pen name carries
a lot of baggage in France.

21:12.700 --> 21:14.700
Her father
was Jean-Marie Le Pen,

21:14.700 --> 21:16.767
who co-founded her party,
the National Front,

21:16.767 --> 21:20.333
and he is a deeply unpleasant
human being.

21:20.333 --> 21:24.033
- Jean-Marie Le Pen famously
dismissed the Nazi gas chambers

21:24.033 --> 21:26.433
as a mere detail of history,

21:26.433 --> 21:28.800
and courts have repeatedly
found him guilty

21:28.800 --> 21:30.800
of questioning the Holocaust.

21:30.800 --> 21:32.667
- Oh, that's just a taster.

21:32.667 --> 21:34.533
He also said
of one Jewish critic,

21:34.533 --> 21:37.200
"We'll put a batch
in the oven next time,"

21:37.200 --> 21:40.233
which is the kind of
vile, horrific anti-Semitism

21:40.233 --> 21:41.433
that gets most people

21:41.433 --> 21:43.333
permanently banished
from society,

21:43.333 --> 21:44.800
as well as an Oscar nomination

21:44.800 --> 21:46.467
for directing "Hacksaw Ridge."

21:46.467 --> 21:48.266
Now--now Marine Le Pen

21:48.266 --> 21:50.667
actually kicked her father
out of the party

21:50.667 --> 21:53.133
and has worked very hard
to rehabilitate

21:53.133 --> 21:56.533
the National Front's reputation
and present a softer image.

21:56.533 --> 21:58.400
And to listen
to one French voter,

21:58.400 --> 22:00.367
it seems to have worked.

22:00.367 --> 22:02.133
- [speaking French]

22:02.133 --> 22:04.333
- Why vote for Nacional?
It's simple.

22:04.333 --> 22:05.667
It's Marine Le Pen.

22:05.667 --> 22:07.133
If it were her father
in charge,

22:07.133 --> 22:09.867
it would be no,
because he's a crazy old man.

22:09.867 --> 22:11.200
Back then,
there were skinheads,

22:11.200 --> 22:13.100
thugs, and fascists
in the party.

22:13.100 --> 22:15.100
With Marine,
it's not like that at all.

22:15.100 --> 22:17.500
There's an elegance,
a bit of restraint.

22:17.500 --> 22:20.000
- Yeah, but elegant presentation

22:20.000 --> 22:22.500
does not negate
poisonous content.

22:22.500 --> 22:24.667
A Klansman is still a Klansman,

22:24.667 --> 22:27.600
even if you slap a monocle
and a top hat on him

22:27.600 --> 22:29.066
and give him a cane.

22:29.066 --> 22:32.100
Wait, wait, hang on, hang on,
take off that sheet.

22:32.100 --> 22:35.033
I fucking knew it!
I fucking knew it!

22:35.033 --> 22:38.800
You're a monster, Peanut!
You're a monster!

22:38.800 --> 22:40.000
No.
[chuckles]

22:40.000 --> 22:41.900
The point--the point is,

22:41.900 --> 22:45.600
Le Pen is particularly popular
among young people in France,

22:45.600 --> 22:47.834
who have a high rate
of unemployment

22:47.834 --> 22:49.266
and have responded
to her promises

22:49.266 --> 22:51.266
to institute programs
to give them jobs

22:51.266 --> 22:54.100
and encourage a national
preference in employment,

22:54.100 --> 22:55.867
making it more expensive
for businesses

22:55.867 --> 22:57.233
to hire non-citizens.

22:57.233 --> 22:59.300
But beneath
her slick presentation,

22:59.300 --> 23:01.367
Le Pen's message is vicious.

23:01.367 --> 23:03.867
A few years back, she was asked
about immigrants in France,

23:03.867 --> 23:05.567
and while her answer
started well,

23:05.567 --> 23:07.834
it quickly deteriorated.

23:07.834 --> 23:10.867
- [speaking French]

23:26.767 --> 23:28.667
- Hold on,
brutalizing your wife

23:28.667 --> 23:30.033
and stealing your wallet
I get.

23:30.033 --> 23:31.867
That's just boilerplate racism.

23:31.867 --> 23:35.166
But, "People are coming
to take my wallpaper,"

23:35.166 --> 23:37.700
is something
a crazy person says.

23:37.700 --> 23:39.433
No one wants your wallpaper,

23:39.433 --> 23:42.633
you catastrophically weird
person.

23:42.633 --> 23:45.266
And while France
is a proudly secular society,

23:45.266 --> 23:48.667
some of Le Pen's proposals
would take that to the extreme.

23:48.667 --> 23:51.533
- Should Muslim people be
allowed to wear head scarves?

23:51.533 --> 23:53.266
- [speaking French]

23:53.266 --> 23:56.567
- No, I'm opposed to wearing
head scarves in public places.

23:56.567 --> 23:57.934
That's not France.

23:57.934 --> 23:59.500
- It's not just head scarves.

23:59.500 --> 24:02.033
Le Pen says she would ban
yarmulkes in public--

24:02.033 --> 24:05.133
any conspicuous symbol
of religious belief.

24:05.133 --> 24:08.333
Would a Sikh person allowed
to be--wear a turban?

24:08.333 --> 24:10.233
- No, not in public.

24:10.233 --> 24:12.033
We don't have
a lot of Sikhs in France.

24:12.033 --> 24:13.633
We've got some,

24:13.633 --> 24:15.934
but we don't really hear
much from them or about them,

24:15.934 --> 24:17.233
which is good news.

24:17.233 --> 24:19.300
- Is it? Is it?

24:19.300 --> 24:21.266
That is such
a reprehensible thing

24:21.266 --> 24:22.867
to say about people
you hope to govern,

24:22.867 --> 24:24.900
that--and I never thought
I'd say this to someone,

24:24.900 --> 24:26.734
because it doesn't
really make sense--

24:26.734 --> 24:29.400
I hope someone steals
your wallpaper.

24:29.400 --> 24:31.300
I--I don't know
why they would, Marine,

24:31.300 --> 24:33.700
but I hope they do.

24:33.700 --> 24:35.300
The truth here is, though,

24:35.300 --> 24:37.367
whatever the result
of this election,

24:37.367 --> 24:40.367
Le Pen has already dangerously
normalized the National Front,

24:40.367 --> 24:41.967
winning seats
at the local level

24:41.967 --> 24:43.767
and even a few
in the legislature.

24:43.767 --> 24:45.100
And one of
the frustrating things

24:45.100 --> 24:47.100
about watching this unfold
from America

24:47.100 --> 24:49.767
is, this feels
a little like déjà vu.

24:49.767 --> 24:52.033
A potentially destabilizing
populist

24:52.033 --> 24:54.100
campaigning on
anti-immigrant rhetoric

24:54.100 --> 24:55.600
who rages against the elites,

24:55.600 --> 24:58.200
despite having a powerful father
and inherited wealth,

24:58.200 --> 25:00.667
even as all the experts
reassure us

25:00.667 --> 25:04.100
that there is no way
that this can possibly happen.

25:04.100 --> 25:06.500
- The truth is,
she's not going to win,

25:06.500 --> 25:07.934
because in
the second round,

25:07.934 --> 25:10.000
everybody will
unite against her.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.767
- I would think that
most people,

25:11.767 --> 25:14.166
it doesn't matter
which political color,

25:14.166 --> 25:17.567
will vote for Macron just to
block the way to Marine Le Pen.

25:17.567 --> 25:19.033
- She will not win.

25:19.033 --> 25:22.700
We will not have in France
another Trump election.

25:22.700 --> 25:25.000
She is not named
Donald Le Pen.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.033
She is just Marine Le Pen.
She will not be elected.

25:28.033 --> 25:30.433
- That is the kind of
reckless overconfidence

25:30.433 --> 25:32.834
you normally only see
in a period piece movie

25:32.834 --> 25:34.233
about a tragedy.

25:34.233 --> 25:36.100
Why, the "Hindenburg"
is the safest

25:36.100 --> 25:37.734
form of travel there is.

25:37.734 --> 25:39.433
I'd like to see
static electricity

25:39.433 --> 25:43.100
even try to set this ship
on fire, I tells ya.

25:43.100 --> 25:44.867
But I would not be
so confident,

25:44.867 --> 25:46.200
especially because

25:46.200 --> 25:47.800
while turnout
in French presidential elections

25:47.800 --> 25:49.667
is normally around 80%,

25:49.667 --> 25:53.100
this time, polls show that
around 1/3 of French voters

25:53.100 --> 25:54.700
might choose to abstain,

25:54.700 --> 25:56.934
and if they do that
in the second round,

25:56.934 --> 26:00.367
Le Pen's very motivated voters
could put her in office,

26:00.367 --> 26:03.133
and that could be bad
for a lot of people.

26:03.133 --> 26:05.433
So please, France,

26:05.433 --> 26:07.233
I would like to try
and convince you

26:07.233 --> 26:10.033
not to sit this election out,
and to do that,

26:10.033 --> 26:13.467
let me appeal to your innate
French sense of superiority

26:13.467 --> 26:14.900
over the U.S. and Britain,

26:14.900 --> 26:17.066
which is,
and it pains me to admit this,

26:17.066 --> 26:19.500
not entirely misplaced.

26:19.500 --> 26:20.967
Real French croissant

26:20.967 --> 26:22.967
are buttery pillows
of perfection,

26:22.967 --> 26:24.967
whereas the American
CROISSAN'WICH

26:24.967 --> 26:27.700
is an ungodly abomination.

26:27.700 --> 26:30.200
Your French wines
are magnificent,

26:30.200 --> 26:32.367
certainly superior
to British wines,

26:32.367 --> 26:36.500
which taste like Michael Caine
urinated in some grape juice.

26:36.500 --> 26:38.300
You in France
love nothing more

26:38.300 --> 26:40.800
than acting like you are better
than Britain and America.

26:40.800 --> 26:43.934
Well, now is your chance
to prove that,

26:43.934 --> 26:46.700
because we made
populist, nativist choices

26:46.700 --> 26:48.967
with Brexit and Trump,
and to be honest,

26:48.967 --> 26:52.133
it's not working out
so great for us so far.

26:52.133 --> 26:55.300
And now you have a populist,
nativist choice of your own,

26:55.300 --> 26:58.066
and just imagine
how superior you can feel

26:58.066 --> 27:00.767
if you don't make
the same mistake that we did.

27:00.767 --> 27:02.800
And I really want
to convince you more,

27:02.800 --> 27:05.400
but I know you don't like
big, gaudy gestures,

27:05.400 --> 27:06.967
so allow me to convince you

27:06.967 --> 27:09.867
in the elegant, restrained
manner that you prefer.

27:09.867 --> 27:13.033
Please, please...
please join me, France,

27:13.033 --> 27:15.233
at a cozy bistro.

27:15.233 --> 27:17.000
[cheers and applause]

27:17.000 --> 27:20.900
Join me at this bistro,

27:20.900 --> 27:24.200
and let us drink wine,
listen to accordion music,

27:24.200 --> 27:26.800
and smoke into
each other's faces.
