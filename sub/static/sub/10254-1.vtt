03:21.900 --> 03:25.400
I saw the father and the nun today at the church.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.500
Well, I've done this often.

03:28.800 --> 03:31.100
I love the kids here.

03:31.100 --> 03:33.940
If I have a baby
I should raise him in a place like this.

03:34.300 --> 03:37.540
...because here we have 
wildflowers and trees to see.

03:37.640 --> 03:39.230
And it's close to Seoul.

03:39.600 --> 03:41.410
Uh? Tow truck?

03:42.360 --> 03:44.210
They said it might take a while to get here.

03:50.590 --> 03:52.820
hmm, I love hearing your voice now.

03:53.670 --> 03:57.050
Since I can hear your voice and it's snowing,

03:57.100 --> 03:59.330
the ambiance in my car has livened up.

04:06.340 --> 04:07.580
Just a second.

04:10.500 --> 04:11.920
Does your tire have an air leak?

04:12.100 --> 04:14.100
Yes, I called a tow truck.

04:14.800 --> 04:18.019
It'll take a long time to get here since it's snowing.

04:18.600 --> 04:20.490
Let me check your tire.

04:27.500 --> 04:30.470
He said he would check the tire.

04:31.850 --> 04:33.070
Really?

04:35.000 --> 04:37.620
I think you should just wait for the tow truck.

04:39.000 --> 04:44.320
Huh? No, it's not hard to
change a tire.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.500
Hmm? It's strange.

04:49.900 --> 04:54.070
You told him you called the tow truck but the guy wants to check your tire.

04:54.250 --> 04:55.720
Wait, wait.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.200
What's the status?

05:01.200 --> 05:02.380
Okay.

05:02.810 --> 05:04.880
Hello? Joo-yeon, I think I should head out now.

05:07.260 --> 05:09.850
Don't open the car door and just wait for
the tow truck.

05:12.280 --> 05:13.420
Huh?

05:17.640 --> 05:18.940
Wait.

05:32.090 --> 05:34.970
"My love...

05:35.710 --> 05:38.630
so sweet...

05:40.500 --> 05:42.290
I just..."

05:42.300 --> 05:49.410
I, I just don't like him checking the tire
even though you told him you called the tow truck.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.380
...Well, there are people around here.

05:57.100 --> 06:01.320
Ha...I'm sorry, I couldn't be with you for your birthday.

06:01.800 --> 06:04.470
Okay. I'll be there soon.

06:04.850 --> 06:06.350
Um.

06:17.350 --> 06:19.740
Your car's completely sunk.

06:20.500 --> 06:24.890
Thank you for your help but I think I should just wait for the tow truck.

06:24.900 --> 06:26.480
Thank you so much.

07:12.850 --> 07:15.300
Why isn't he leaving?

09:17.060 --> 09:32.230
I Saw the Devil

10:04.000 --> 10:12.620
Mister... Mister... Mister...

11:17.900 --> 11:22.520
It's going to be easy since your skin is so soft.

11:29.210 --> 11:32.530
Can you please not kill me?

11:35.250 --> 11:37.160
Why?

11:39.400 --> 11:42.440
I...

11:44.400 --> 11:47.800
have a baby in my belly.

11:56.300 --> 11:59.330
Spare my life, please.

14:44.210 --> 14:47.250
Dong-soo! Dong-soo!

14:48.200 --> 14:49.050
What?

14:49.060 --> 14:51.690
Come over here! Hurry Up!

15:42.500 --> 15:45.530
Detective! Why did you come out here?

15:45.560 --> 15:49.830
We can let you know the situation later if you stay at home.

15:50.050 --> 15:54.040
What happened? What happened to my daughter?

15:54.300 --> 15:56.560
Don't look. Not now.

15:56.800 --> 15:59.210
We don't know yet.

16:31.790 --> 16:32.640
Detective Joh.

16:33.780 --> 16:34.830
Here.

16:36.490 --> 16:38.030
Is this...?

16:38.030 --> 16:38.980
Let me see.

16:41.360 --> 16:44.300
It looks like hair. Flip it over.

17:14.060 --> 17:15.069
Forensics team!

17:15.510 --> 17:16.740
Here, here! Come here, hurry!

17:17.369 --> 17:20.119
We found it--we found it over here.

20:03.990 --> 20:07.830
...God helped us.

20:08.970 --> 20:12.670
Otherwise we wouldn't have been able to find her.

20:16.700 --> 20:20.020
It's funny how the father couldn't protect his own daughter,

20:20.150 --> 20:28.030
even though he has been a detective in charge of violent crime for over 30 years.

20:38.710 --> 20:40.090
...Please stop smoking sir.

20:46.400 --> 20:47.750
I'm sorry.

20:50.620 --> 20:58.890
I'm really sorry.

21:04.380 --> 21:11.600
To you and to my Joo-yeon.

21:17.760 --> 21:22.500
I am terribly sorry.

21:50.070 --> 21:51.750
I'm sorry, Joo-yeon.

21:53.280 --> 21:55.160
I couldn't keep the promise.

21:56.650 --> 22:01.540
I was late and couldn't keep the promise.

22:03.920 --> 22:05.310
But Joo-yeon,

22:07.360 --> 22:10.360
I'll promise this:

22:13.620 --> 22:20.560
I'll give him pain that's a thousand times--

22:20.680 --> 22:23.420
no--ten thousand times worse.

22:29.940 --> 22:32.820
Soo-hyun.

23:15.860 --> 23:17.880
So, how long do you want?

23:18.710 --> 23:21.970
Since there's nothing urgent to do, you can rest for a few months.

23:22.250 --> 23:23.580
Two weeks is enough.

23:23.700 --> 23:25.140
You can rest longer.

23:25.140 --> 23:29.010
No, I'll come back to work after two weeks.

23:30.250 --> 23:33.420
Well, I really appreciate it if you can do that.

23:34.400 --> 23:36.260
But are you going to be okay?

23:45.440 --> 23:46.890
...Alright.

23:47.010 --> 23:50.310
Then I'll be expecting you in two weeks.

23:50.500 --> 23:53.130
In the meantime, please rest yourself fully.

24:00.330 --> 24:02.950
I can't believe this happened to us.

24:03.170 --> 24:05.300
They just got engaged less than a month ago.

24:05.940 --> 24:09.520
What a crazy world.

24:17.880 --> 24:19.710
You're here.

24:23.130 --> 24:26.500
Here's the GPS,

24:26.940 --> 24:28.050
and the capsule.

24:28.560 --> 24:31.150
There's a GPS and a voice mic inside here.

24:31.470 --> 24:32.670
Isn't it marvelous?

24:37.040 --> 24:39.080
Good job.

24:39.220 --> 24:40.420
Thank you.

24:40.640 --> 24:42.870
You're welcome.

24:48.530 --> 24:49.430
Aren't you going in?

24:49.570 --> 24:50.220
Yes?

24:51.140 --> 24:53.340
Isn't there anything to say?

24:53.740 --> 24:55.220
No.

24:56.270 --> 25:02.560
Well, I trust you
but if there's going to be any problem,

25:02.700 --> 25:07.180
we could get into serious trouble 
since I siphoned them off from another division.

25:07.330 --> 25:08.430
Don't worry.

25:10.020 --> 25:12.360
I'll make sure there's no problem.

25:23.480 --> 25:31.300
The police suspect those four.

25:32.070 --> 25:37.350
They were the suspects when there were similar cases before.

25:40.890 --> 25:42.200
Soo-hyun, you're here.

25:42.340 --> 25:43.700
Yeah.

25:44.200 --> 25:46.860
Do you want to have supper?

25:47.280 --> 25:49.030
No, I have to leave now.

25:49.940 --> 25:51.960
I went grocery shopping for dad.

25:56.670 --> 25:57.760
I'll get going now.

25:57.920 --> 25:58.460
Don't see me off outside.

25:59.330 --> 26:00.030
Are you leaving?

26:00.470 --> 26:01.110
Yes.

26:25.910 --> 26:28.860
Why isn't this bastard moving a single muscle?

26:32.670 --> 26:33.920
Yes.

26:34.880 --> 26:37.390
There's no suspicious movement yet.

26:37.400 --> 26:38.640
Yes.

26:40.140 --> 26:41.070
Yes sir.

26:41.370 --> 26:43.840
This guy's the dirtiest pervert, I swear.

28:09.190 --> 28:10.470
Quiet.

28:14.120 --> 28:15.560
Do you remember this?

28:19.710 --> 28:21.240
You really don't know?

28:28.520 --> 28:30.050
I see.

28:47.390 --> 28:48.390
Who the fuck is he?

28:48.690 --> 28:49.700
Why does he look so bruised up?

28:49.850 --> 28:51.140
Why's he turning himself in?

28:51.280 --> 28:55.350
Two months ago, there was a dead teenage girl's body
in Bang-Ho river--he said he did that girl.

28:55.470 --> 28:58.560
He confessed that the missing Shin-Chun high school girl
a few years ago was his job too.

28:59.660 --> 29:01.980
What the hell is wrong with him?

29:02.130 --> 29:03.230
Why does he have so many bruises?

29:03.380 --> 29:05.120
Who did this? Did you guys do it?

29:05.610 --> 29:12.400
No. All of a sudden paramedics came and went upstairs and found him almost dead like this.

29:12.750 --> 29:14.650
Then who did this? He injured himself?

29:15.280 --> 29:16.780
He didn't explain that part yet.

29:17.120 --> 29:20.140
What the--hey, what happened to you last night?

29:28.400 --> 29:29.680
What the hell is he saying?

29:29.810 --> 29:35.250
It sounds like some guy hit his penis with a hammer badly.

29:35.400 --> 29:38.590
Ahh, that's nonsense.

29:40.510 --> 29:42.130
Hey retard, who hit your penis?

30:11.300 --> 30:13.180
Who the fuck are you?

30:21.370 --> 30:23.350
Hey you motherfucker!

33:17.160 --> 33:20.110
There're no more buses at this time of day.

33:20.790 --> 33:22.120
Where are you going?

33:23.110 --> 33:23.890
Pardon me?

33:24.490 --> 33:25.850
I said, where are you going?

33:27.060 --> 33:28.270
Sungmin apartment.

33:28.420 --> 33:29.700
Sungmin?

33:30.650 --> 33:34.060
Since it's not too far from here, I can give you a ride.

33:34.430 --> 33:36.230
I can take you there.

33:36.610 --> 33:37.690
No thanks.

33:38.370 --> 33:40.480
I can take you there.

33:40.650 --> 33:41.910
It's okay.

33:42.400 --> 33:46.240
Sungmin apartment is very close to here.

33:55.670 --> 33:57.220
It's okay.

34:01.930 --> 34:03.490
Are you sure?

34:05.580 --> 34:07.140
Yeah, it's okay.

34:07.320 --> 34:08.750
Get in the car.

34:27.760 --> 34:28.790
What?

34:29.050 --> 34:31.929
Yes? Nothing.

34:37.920 --> 34:39.889
Is this an after-school academic bus?

35:03.980 --> 35:06.050
Where did I leave it?

35:40.080 --> 35:41.040
What?

35:42.610 --> 35:43.920
Yes?

35:44.100 --> 35:46.330
Why are you looking so scared?

35:49.670 --> 35:51.350
Haven't you seen this before?

37:09.020 --> 37:10.620
Who are you?

37:26.850 --> 37:31.300
By the way, why do you need these to get the insurance money?

37:31.810 --> 37:35.610
First of all, I need to make sure that your son
is my policyholder, Jang Gyeong-chul,

37:36.130 --> 37:37.850
since there are many people with the same name.

37:39.430 --> 37:41.400
These are all old pictures.

37:51.930 --> 37:55.630
Maybe you can recognize him in this picture.

38:00.670 --> 38:02.720
I'll ask a few more questions.

38:03.810 --> 38:07.910
Is there any other way to contact him now?

38:08.940 --> 38:12.010
I don't know, but his son might know how to contact him.

38:13.400 --> 38:16.220
Sang-hoon! Sang-hoon!

38:16.890 --> 38:18.510
Where is he?

38:20.190 --> 38:27.010
Yangpyeong? Chungpyeong? I think.

38:28.200 --> 38:33.390
Lastly, I want to make sure your son is the one that I'm looking for.

38:38.810 --> 38:40.690
Is this Jang Gyeong-chul?

38:45.150 --> 38:46.750
He's Gyeong-chul.

38:47.640 --> 38:52.320
Was this picture taken recently?

38:53.980 --> 38:59.510
How come he looks so scary here?

38:59.860 --> 39:02.060
Insurance my ass.

39:04.690 --> 39:07.410
He insured the family?

39:08.220 --> 39:12.010
He left us, and his son, and never came back!

39:12.770 --> 39:14.930
Now you think he has an insurance policy on our names?

39:15.800 --> 39:17.810
That's nonsense!

39:17.950 --> 39:18.850
Why are you saying that?

39:18.980 --> 39:23.370
Am I wrong? Do you still think he's our son?

39:24.650 --> 39:27.890
He's good for nothing!

39:28.060 --> 39:31.080
Please shut your mouth and snap out of it.

39:31.220 --> 39:32.790
Why are you saying that?

39:33.550 --> 39:35.290
It's not appropriate to say stuff like that.

39:35.420 --> 39:37.090
Fuck, whatever.

39:43.070 --> 39:47.150
By the way, if the policyholder is dead or missing,

39:47.320 --> 39:50.810
does his family get the money?

40:18.190 --> 40:19.710
Are you Sang-hoon?

40:26.480 --> 40:28.410
Do you know where your father lives now?

40:31.870 --> 40:37.370
Shit. Why do you ask?

44:05.470 --> 44:07.870
You guys don't go anywhere but home now, alright?

44:07.990 --> 44:08.950
Yes.

44:13.050 --> 44:15.290
Driver, please don't let them out anywhere else.

44:15.460 --> 44:16.090
Yeah.

44:16.410 --> 44:17.370
Thank you.

45:02.970 --> 45:04.170
Who are you?

45:04.300 --> 45:05.240
Is Jang Gyeong-chul here?

45:06.080 --> 45:07.000
Why do you ask that?

45:07.120 --> 45:08.860
We're police. Where is he?

45:09.640 --> 45:11.280
He's driving our kids to their homes now.

45:11.410 --> 45:13.780
Can you call him right now? Please?

46:02.950 --> 46:04.550
What? One girl is missing?

46:04.920 --> 46:06.590
What were you guys doing?

46:06.740 --> 46:08.450
How come you guys didn't notice Jang Gyeong-chul leaving the house?

46:08.900 --> 46:10.400
You guys were asleep while staking out, right?

46:10.800 --> 46:12.540
How come you guys missed him?

46:14.300 --> 46:16.020
You're reporting back to me that shit happens?

46:16.500 --> 46:17.860
You guys were all at the front of the house, right?

46:18.520 --> 46:19.310
What were you guys doing there?

46:19.500 --> 46:20.700
Did you guys plan to catch him after greeting him?

46:21.140 --> 46:22.410
What a bunch of retards.

46:22.540 --> 46:23.500
Now listen.

46:23.880 --> 46:27.840
We need to watch every corner of the after-school academy and we must find Jang Gyeong-chul first.

46:28.350 --> 46:29.540
We don't need a fucking warrant.

46:29.950 --> 46:32.020
We just gotta catch him, got it?

46:32.840 --> 46:35.440
Mark my words: he is the murderer.

46:35.570 --> 46:37.460
Go catch him!

46:42.400 --> 46:43.260
It's me.

46:43.720 --> 46:47.410
I just got home to get changed but I don't think I have enough time to get changed now.

46:47.860 --> 46:49.480
So...where are you going?

46:49.640 --> 46:50.440
To my friend's place.

46:50.600 --> 46:51.250
Friend? Who?

46:51.390 --> 46:52.530
Do you know any of my friends?

46:52.740 --> 46:53.190
What?

46:53.340 --> 46:55.590
Do you just want to take the clothes or do you want to get changed now?

46:55.730 --> 46:56.710
No, I don't have time.

46:56.850 --> 46:57.730
Just give me the clothes.

46:57.900 --> 46:58.710
No, I wasn't talking to you.

46:59.200 --> 47:00.750
Why are you going to a friend's place at this time?

47:00.910 --> 47:02.080
To study!

47:02.620 --> 47:04.110
Why are you studying at your friend's place?

47:04.500 --> 47:06.590
Why are you nagging me now?

47:06.880 --> 47:09.930
Are you talking back to me? Come over here!

47:10.060 --> 47:10.770
No!

47:11.080 --> 47:12.220
Look at this girl!

47:13.510 --> 47:15.340
What are you doing now? Hurry up and go.

47:53.560 --> 47:56.140
Let me see.

48:32.290 --> 48:34.950
Ah...your skin is so pale.

48:40.490 --> 48:41.730
It's okay, it's okay.

48:42.590 --> 48:44.350
I'll finish it real quick.

48:46.000 --> 48:52.040
It looks like I can't fucking drive the academic bus anymore.

48:54.570 --> 48:56.230
...Things are getting fucking twisted now.

49:02.170 --> 49:06.540
But shit, can't I like you?

49:08.940 --> 49:10.450
I can like you, right?

49:12.370 --> 49:14.040
It's totally okay that I like you.

49:15.480 --> 49:19.330
Then why the fuck is the whole world giving me so much shit, huh?

49:20.390 --> 49:21.530
Why is that?

49:31.720 --> 49:37.020
I'll finish it real quick.

49:52.880 --> 49:55.380
Jang Gyeong-chul.

51:42.700 --> 51:45.370
What? Are you alone?

51:51.200 --> 51:52.880
Are you a cop?

52:07.470 --> 52:09.280
I see, you're a cop.

52:16.110 --> 52:18.540
How come the Korean police found me so quickly?

52:20.400 --> 52:22.140
I'm so surprised.

52:26.140 --> 52:29.400
I guess you still don't know who I am now.

52:30.520 --> 52:34.500
Well, what do I expect from the Korean police?

52:36.420 --> 52:38.240
That's that.

53:28.400 --> 53:29.590
You shithead!

53:30.760 --> 53:32.980
Fuck you!

56:59.480 --> 57:01.690
What, what the hell is this guy?

57:03.220 --> 57:07.590
This guy's a fucking psycho.

58:04.610 --> 58:06.490
Fucking asshole.

58:51.710 --> 58:52.480
Hello, sir!

58:52.700 --> 58:57.030
I don't know where you're headed,
but you can take this taxi.

58:58.250 --> 58:59.300
Aren't you getting in?

58:59.700 --> 59:01.090
There're no more taxis at this time.

59:04.690 --> 59:07.890
How come you decided to walk this road alone?

59:09.570 --> 59:13.910
Well, you're lucky that you got a taxi here.

59:15.280 --> 59:17.400
The customer in the back seat is heading in the same direction.

59:18.010 --> 59:19.300
You're okay going with this gentleman, right?

59:19.570 --> 59:21.140
Sure.

59:38.670 --> 59:40.500
Anyway, it must've been really hard for you to catch a taxi.

59:41.180 --> 59:44.170
You can hardly see a taxi around here at this time.

59:45.200 --> 59:46.790
I rarely even drive here.

59:47.210 --> 59:49.770
Only once in a while, I come here for work.

59:50.500 --> 59:54.390
But you gentlemen are so lucky today.

59:56.190 --> 59:57.030
You know that?

59:57.800 --> 01:00:03.310
Recently, there've been so many bad incidents
around this area that I can't get any customers here.

01:00:05.110 --> 01:00:07.530
But today I have two customers here.

01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:11.720
Come to think of it, I'm also lucky today!

01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:13.510
Ain't I, sir?

01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:23.690
Where were you gentlemen going from such a dark place?

01:00:38.830 --> 01:00:43.680
Sir? Did something good happen to you today, sir?

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.010
Mister.

01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:46.410
Yes?

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.900
You said we're all lucky today.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.120
That's what I said.

01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:58.730
Why?

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:06.740
But I think you're so unlucky today.

01:02:33.570 --> 01:02:35.780
Crazy retards.

01:04:12.590 --> 01:04:14.650
Your bones will be attached soon since you're young.

01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:16.940
Don't worry about it.

01:04:17.590 --> 01:04:22.890
How did you break your wrist playing soccer?

01:04:25.110 --> 01:04:27.340
Did you play with your fists?

01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:30.660
Anyway, from now on take it slowly. Got it?

01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:38.060
It's done.

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:39.920
You can leave.

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:45.460
Hey, you motherfucker.

01:04:49.170 --> 01:04:50.650
Am I your son?

01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:56.560
Then why do you talk down to me?

01:05:02.570 --> 01:05:03.960
Take off your glasses.

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.080
Take off your glasses.

01:05:14.550 --> 01:05:15.820
Come here.

01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:18.100
Come over here.

01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:22.200
Sir? You can come outside now.

01:05:22.350 --> 01:05:24.380
You need to take the prescription.

01:05:34.310 --> 01:05:35.600
How old are you?

01:05:38.670 --> 01:05:40.750
I'm 22.

01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:43.020
Must be nice being 22.

01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:45.590
Boyfriend?

01:05:46.550 --> 01:05:47.650
Pardon me?

01:05:49.530 --> 01:05:53.140
You look like you have many boyfriends. Right?

01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:57.100
No. I don't have a boyfriend.

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.840
Don't fucking lie to me.

01:06:03.050 --> 01:06:06.270
How come a cutie like you don't have a boyfriend?

01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:12.780
You don't know about 'IT.'

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:16.050
Excuse me?

01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:19.630
If you don't know about 'IT,' 
then you can hardly know about men.

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:44.900
Yesterday I was going to have some fun,
but some asshole spoiled everything.

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:54.360
So this time I want to go smoothly with you.

01:08:23.359 --> 01:08:24.810
Take off your clothes.

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:27.450
Huh?

01:08:32.830 --> 01:08:35.109
Take off your clothes, yourself.

01:08:37.270 --> 01:08:39.649
Since we're going to do it, you should enjoy it too, right?

01:08:42.210 --> 01:08:44.210
So take off your clothes.

01:09:03.170 --> 01:09:06.670
Take them off before I put scars on your face
with my knife, bitch.

01:09:11.649 --> 01:09:14.840
I said, take them off quickly, you bitch.

01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:08.460
That's right.

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:19.430
Take off your bra too. Hurry up.

01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:35.230
Please don't kill me.

01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:52.000
That's it. Take off your skirt too.

01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:26.760
You son of a bitch.

01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:31.070
Who the hell are you, you fucking bitch.

01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:27.870
Wait.

01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:30.140
Don't leave now.

01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:32.140
I need to treat you immediately.

01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:36.700
Why are you pretending to be so weak?

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:38.450
It's just the beginning.

01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:43.190
Remember this.

01:13:44.450 --> 01:13:46.200
It's going to be even more terrible.

01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:54.790
Close your eyes now.

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:56.490
Turn around, and cover your ears too.

01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:03.750
Hey fuck you, crazy ass motherfucker, shit!

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:12.020
Ha! Son of a bitch!

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:14.650
You want to do this against me, huh?

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:17.680
Hey, you son of a bitch! You really want to do this?!

01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:19.780
Crazy motherfucker.

01:16:21.150 --> 01:16:25.370
Alright, you fucking shithead, let's see who's the top dog here.

01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:39.900
What is it?

01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:45.910
Has there been an accident?

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.370
Looks like something's wrong with the car.

01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:16.080
Yes, sir.

01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:19.880
Is everything okay with you?

01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:27.750
I'm just worried about you.

01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:34.390
The police think that I'm after Jang Gyeong-chul.

01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:40.050
It seems like they're also after Jang Gyeong-chul.

01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:44.890
So I was wondering....

01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:51.500
if you can stop chasing him now.

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:52.850
But I...

01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:54.970
You've done enough.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.060
I want you to stop it.

01:19:58.370 --> 01:20:00.220
But, sir...

01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:13.990
never mind.

01:20:14.350 --> 01:20:16.790
I see. I'll hang up.

01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:21.380
Soo-hyun, it's me.

01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:24.590
Soo-hyun.

01:20:25.450 --> 01:20:27.540
Yeah, how are you doing?

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:29.910
How are you doing, Soo-hyun?

01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:33.130
I'm just busy with my work now.

01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:37.490
Really? What kind of work?

01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:40.710
You know what I do.

01:20:41.330 --> 01:20:45.120
I know what you do normally, but I don't know what you do secretly.

01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:47.570
You got the criminal's information from my dad already?

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:55.650
Soo-hyun, I understand how you feel, but I want you to stop it.

01:20:57.330 --> 01:20:59.990
My sister won't come back, even if you do this.

01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:07.210
Even if you catch him, nothing changes.

01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:13.770
Revenge is something people do in a movie,
but this man is just crazy.

01:21:15.330 --> 01:21:18.650
I'm sorry, but I have nothing to tell you.

01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:21.010
What do you mean you have nothing to tell me?

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:24.320
Am I nobody to you?

01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:29.080
Do you know how I have been lately?

01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:33.900
Recently, I started checking back a lot
to see if anyone's following me.

01:21:36.430 --> 01:21:39.280
Now you tell me you have nothing to tell me?

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.840
So I beg you now.

01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:52.340
There's no meaning. Please stop it.

01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:57.510
I'm sorry, I have to hang up now.

01:21:57.510 --> 01:22:02.230
And this work is not meaningless.

01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:54.630
Water.

01:22:54.700 --> 01:22:56.880
Give me water.

01:23:37.340 --> 01:23:41.140
Do you remember the time when we first met each other?

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:47.020
We wanted to organize a terrorist group and flip the world upside down.

01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:53.250
I miss those days.

01:23:54.900 --> 01:23:56.810
We got nothing to be afraid of.

01:23:57.140 --> 01:24:00.710
...Talk about this crap later when your mom dies,
just give me a cigar now.

01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:38.290
He must be related to one of the dead girls' families.

01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:40.520
Who the hell would do that, if he's not?

01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:49.320
He's joined our club, too.

01:24:49.450 --> 01:24:53.820
He's enjoying it--the same way you feel excited
when you're on the hunt.

01:24:55.980 --> 01:25:01.000
Catch it, and release it; catch it, and release it.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.990
He's playing the hunting game now.

01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:12.730
It looks like you got caught really bad this time.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.430
This guy went crazy after losing his bitch.

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:24.700
Monster appeared.

01:25:24.710 --> 01:25:27.720
It's funny.

01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:47.610
Go to bed, you must be tired now.

01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:49.420
There are a lot of vacant rooms.

01:25:49.770 --> 01:25:51.770
You can sleep in any room.

01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:58.430
And I will prepare breakfast for tomorrow.

01:26:15.130 --> 01:26:17.300
Fucking assholes.

01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:55.200
Let go. Let go of me!

01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:09.660
Fuck you, asshole.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.790
Shit, you guys are fucking crazy.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.670
Little bit more, little bit more.

01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:11.050
One more time.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.840
He's enjoying it--the same way you feel excited
when you're on the hunt.

01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:04.860
Catch it, and release it; catch it, and release it.

01:29:04.870 --> 01:29:07.180
He's enjoying seeing his prey in pain.

01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:10.490
He's playing the hunting game now.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.780
It's going to be even more terrible.

01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:29.500
It's fun.

01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:49.490
Don't do that.

01:30:50.050 --> 01:30:52.170
Didn't you see Mi-yeon last night?

01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:58.320
If you resist, it's more painful and takes longer.

01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:04.650
It'll be done quickly.

01:31:04.900 --> 01:31:06.940
So bear with me for a little bit.

01:31:10.300 --> 01:31:13.590
Then why did you suspect us? Huh?

01:31:14.300 --> 01:31:17.090
Did we ask for a house or money?

01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:20.430
We just wanted to stay here for few days, so why'd you guys give us shit!

01:31:20.850 --> 01:31:24.840
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:34.580
You should've said that earlier. Huh!

01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:43.510
You retards always do that after shit happens.

01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:48.560
Wait, wait, the order is arms, legs, and head. Right?

01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:52.960
Close your eyes. It's better not to see it.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.770
Where is she?

01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:08.460
How did you come inside without making any noise?

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.450
I have a baby in my belly.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.840
I was curious how you'd look.

01:33:54.740 --> 01:33:57.250
I see you don't look like a monster.

01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:01.780
Crazy asshole.

01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:12.540
The order is arms, legs and head. Right?

01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:15.100
I'll do exactly the same as how you guys did.

01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:18.010
Don't worry about it, I won't do any more than that.

01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:21.960
You crazy psycho fuckers.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.430
I am actually relieved right now.

01:41:35.550 --> 01:41:39.060
I was worried that something might've happened to you.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:44.080
He's Kim Soo-hyun from NIS (National Intelligence Service), right?

01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:48.880
Do you want to see what he's been up to?

01:41:54.850 --> 01:41:56.500
Please make him stop.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:00.170
You can't become a monster to fight against a monster.

01:42:03.450 --> 01:42:06.220
You're worried about him too, right?

01:42:08.550 --> 01:42:10.030
Where is he now?

01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:13.670
You should be okay since I treated you immediately.

01:42:18.850 --> 01:42:21.870
You know you both slept for 2 days straight?

01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:26.460
What happened?

01:42:28.350 --> 01:42:33.280
Why don't you just hand him over to the police?

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:37.830
Not yet.

01:42:37.850 --> 01:42:39.870
What are you gonna do?

01:42:41.850 --> 01:42:49.430
Do you know how it feels to have a huge lump in your chest?

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.710
That feeling...

01:42:56.250 --> 01:42:58.680
I promised something to Joo-yeon.

01:42:58.850 --> 01:43:03.390
I will pay back what he's done.

01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:07.590
Not yet.

01:43:10.850 --> 01:43:12.940
It's still far from the end.

01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:18.450
Alright. I won't ask you any more.

01:43:18.850 --> 01:43:23.800
By the way, the capsule's really good, right? Unless he has constipation...

01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:33.650
He was knocked out after I gave him one strong shot.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:37.200
I don't think he'll wake up until tomorrow.

01:43:44.850 --> 01:43:49.770
Soo-hyun, you know you look so different now?

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:25.760
Hello.

01:45:25.890 --> 01:45:28.350
Can I have a painkiller with Dexibuprofen in it?

01:45:28.470 --> 01:45:31.500
What? Dexi- what?

01:45:31.750 --> 01:45:32.900
Give me the strongest one.

01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:34.310
Okay.

01:45:37.850 --> 01:45:39.250
Where are you now?

01:45:39.450 --> 01:45:41.250
It looks like you're not around.

01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:46.500
Hey, are you listening? Of course you are.

01:45:47.350 --> 01:45:50.270
This is really fun! Huh!?

01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:55.130
I've never had this kind of fun before, my whole life.

01:45:57.250 --> 01:46:00.790
Hey... I know who you are.

01:46:01.450 --> 01:46:06.540
Your girlfriend was Jang Joo-yeon, lived in Yeonyi county. Right?

01:46:07.250 --> 01:46:09.840
Am I correct?

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.990
I want you to know that you made a mistake.

01:46:14.850 --> 01:46:17.050
You underestimated me.

01:46:17.850 --> 01:46:20.740
You'll regret that you didn't kill me when you had a chance.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.090
It doesn't even take much time to kill someone.

01:46:23.180 --> 01:46:24.090
Hello?

01:46:24.510 --> 01:46:29.630
You'll see. I'll teach you how pain really feels.

01:46:31.250 --> 01:46:34.480
Hey, excuse me!

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:47.200
By the way, before I killed her, she told me that she was pregnant

01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:50.500
and begged for her life.

01:46:52.250 --> 01:46:55.250
Did you know that?

01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:05.960
Hu, hu, hu, hu, hurry up you asshole.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.100
Otherwise, that woman will die.

01:47:09.850 --> 01:47:13.480
You should've been around me, since you let me stay alive.

01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:59.100
Jang Gyeong-chul. Where did you go?

01:50:22.780 --> 01:50:27.020
Shit, do we have to do this to save them?

01:50:28.300 --> 01:50:32.900
Sometimes when I look at assholes like them, I don't want to be a human.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:36.060
Call me when they wake up.

01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:45.310
What is this again?

01:50:45.500 --> 01:50:48.010
So what?

01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:55.470
Really? Is that for real?

01:50:57.600 --> 01:50:59.600
I got it.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:04.710
Hey, Jang Gyeong-chul is turning himself in.

01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:08.470
You son of a bitch, you made a mistake.

01:52:01.500 --> 01:52:03.600
Wake up.

01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:16.560
I want to ask you something.

01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:20.990
Where would your friend go?

01:52:32.250 --> 01:52:37.690
You shouldn't have got on his nerves.

01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:43.790
He pays back what he gets.

01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:48.340
Do you know what I mean?

01:52:50.930 --> 01:52:56.350
Your girl, your girl's family, huh?

01:52:59.300 --> 01:53:05.710
After that, if he turns himself in, it's all done.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:15.190
But your girl must've not felt so bad.

01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:24.500
Unlike me, he gives pleasure before he gives pain.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:31.250
He gives pleasure first.

01:53:33.700 --> 01:53:38.780
Funny? Is that really funny?

01:53:40.550 --> 01:53:43.040
That really makes you smile?

01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:57.840
Alright, I'll make you smile for the rest of your life.

01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:05.900
I wiretapped a call from Jang Gyeong-chul.

01:54:06.200 --> 01:54:09.640
I was wiretapping the police communication because I was worried about you.

01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:13.460
Just a few moments ago, Jang Gyeong-chul called the police,
saying he wants to turn himself in.

01:54:13.500 --> 01:54:16.830
But before he does that, he said he wants to finish some business.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.490
Is he gonna do it again?

01:54:19.500 --> 01:54:20.940
What location did you wiretap the call from?

01:54:20.950 --> 01:54:22.800
Yeonyi County.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:11.180
Detective Joh?

01:55:13.500 --> 01:55:15.170
This is Kim Soo-hyun.

01:55:15.800 --> 01:55:16.830
What?

01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:20.680
Why did you make things worse and let this happen?

01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:26.920
You're a dead man if anything happens to him. Got it!?

01:55:27.450 --> 01:55:29.830
Fucking answer me!

01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:40.000
Tell the other teams to go to Detective Jang's place, and turn the car around. Hurry up!

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:41.650
Look alike?

01:57:41.700 --> 01:57:43.450
No.

01:57:43.450 --> 01:57:46.910
Joo-yeon must take after her mom.

01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:51.380
Thank god she doesn't take after her dad.

01:57:55.450 --> 01:57:58.890
Then why did you charge toward me like crazy?

01:57:58.900 --> 01:58:01.790
Are you crazy? Crazy?

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.100
Let me see.

01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:09.970
Shit, where is it?

01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:15.340
What would make that motherfucker get angry?

01:58:16.250 --> 01:58:18.130
Would he get mad if I do this?

01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:22.750
Like this? Like this? Like this?

01:58:23.300 --> 01:58:30.210
Like this, crazy motherfucker,
like this, you son of a bitch.

01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:28.780
Dad, I'm home.

02:00:26.500 --> 02:00:27.690
You can't come inside here.

02:00:27.800 --> 02:00:29.780
You can't.

02:00:39.200 --> 02:00:40.980
What is it?

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:44.070
Let go of him.

02:00:44.600 --> 02:00:48.570
Are you Kim Soo-hyun?

02:00:52.600 --> 02:00:54.300
You bastard!

02:00:54.440 --> 02:00:55.490
Come over here!

02:00:55.500 --> 02:01:00.490
Do you have any idea what you've done? How dare you show up here!

02:01:00.500 --> 02:01:03.190
You worthless, crazy...

02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:06.800
Let go. Let go of me.

02:01:10.200 --> 02:01:14.000
What a ruthless bastard.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:18.690
Stay out of the way.

02:01:18.700 --> 02:01:20.770
Out of the way.

02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:04.790
Hello?

02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:07.000
This is Jang Gyeong-chul.

02:03:07.700 --> 02:03:10.210
You bastard.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.850
Where are you now?

02:03:15.100 --> 02:03:18.490
You, you didn't do anything to Sae-yeon. Right?

02:03:18.600 --> 02:03:21.420
You can find out later.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.610
What?

02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:37.600
Here.

02:03:53.550 --> 02:03:54.750
Hello.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.430
How do you feel? Can you feel it now?

02:04:07.900 --> 02:04:13.270
Why did you fucking start chasing me, you ignorant fucking asshole.

02:04:13.900 --> 02:04:15.880
Who do you think won?

02:04:16.850 --> 02:04:20.070
You, or me?

02:05:46.950 --> 02:05:49.450
Jang Gyeong-chul, Jang Gyeong-chul!

02:05:49.970 --> 02:05:52.060
Jang Gyeong-chul showed up!

02:05:52.640 --> 02:05:54.840
Wait for my command.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:58.840
Now!

02:07:03.300 --> 02:07:04.830
Hurry up!

02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:11.440
Stop that car! Stop it!

02:07:14.800 --> 02:07:16.130
Catch him!

02:07:26.300 --> 02:07:28.250
Catch him! Catch him!

02:07:33.700 --> 02:07:35.670
Hey!

02:08:47.100 --> 02:08:50.030
Yes, you're right.

02:08:52.100 --> 02:08:54.550
I was wrong.

02:09:00.850 --> 02:09:04.360
I underestimated you.

02:09:18.500 --> 02:09:21.880
From now on, I won't go easy on you.

02:09:27.950 --> 02:09:29.720
You son of a bitch, what are you doing?

02:09:29.850 --> 02:09:34.150
What are you doing?

02:09:34.750 --> 02:09:36.590
It's just the beginning.

02:09:36.600 --> 02:09:38.880
Why cry like a baby already?

02:09:41.410 --> 02:09:43.780
You son of a bitch.

02:09:44.800 --> 02:09:46.960
Son of a bitch, kill me already.

02:09:47.140 --> 02:09:49.050
Kill me already, son of a bitch.

02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:51.140
Kill me now, bitch!

02:09:52.300 --> 02:09:54.550
Son of a bitch. Kill me already.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:59.340
Kill me already, son of a bitch. Kill me already!

02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:11.690
No. Not yet. Wait more.

02:10:14.800 --> 02:10:20.070
Think about it. If I were going to kill you, I would've already killed you before.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:26.140
I'll kill you when you are in the most pain.

02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:35.080
When you're in the most pain, shivering out of fear--
then, I will kill you.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:47.770
That's a real revenge.
A real, complete revenge.

02:10:56.700 --> 02:10:59.990
Spare, spare my life.

02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:10.060
Spare, spare, spare, spare my life.

02:11:17.600 --> 02:11:23.990
You heard that a lot, right? "Spare my life."

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.550
You must've enjoyed hearing that a lot.

02:11:31.430 --> 02:11:36.590
Spare my life. Spare my life.

02:11:43.500 --> 02:11:49.130
I'll get punished.

02:11:51.500 --> 02:12:02.560
So, so spare my life, I've already had enough.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:11.840
Since I've already had enough, stop it.

02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:30.520
Please, please spare my life.

02:12:31.450 --> 02:12:37.630
I'm really sorry.

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:53.200
Please, please spare my life.

02:13:10.500 --> 02:13:15.820
Are you scared?

02:13:17.450 --> 02:13:23.140
Tell me, now. Are you scared?

02:13:26.450 --> 02:13:34.040
Do you realize what you did now?

02:13:55.200 --> 02:14:04.300
You've played with me enough,
so stop it, son of a bitch.

02:14:08.500 --> 02:14:14.720
Hey...stop talking bullshit now.

02:14:17.200 --> 02:14:22.240
You lost already.

02:14:22.600 --> 02:14:28.210
You think you've played with me till now.

02:14:30.600 --> 02:14:33.700
Bullshit.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:46.700
I don't know what pain is.
Fear? Don't know that either.

02:14:48.100 --> 02:14:54.700
There's nothing you can get out of me.

02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:10.050
So...you already lost.

02:15:10.100 --> 02:15:13.440
You know that?

02:15:42.350 --> 02:15:50.650
I wish you'd still feel pain after you die.

02:17:36.299 --> 02:17:37.950
Son of a bitch!

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:41.950
Fucking asshole, you're dead!

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:46.590
Crazy bitch! I'll stay alive. I'll fucking stay alive.

02:17:46.600 --> 02:17:49.900
You son of a bitch, I will stay alive.

02:17:50.150 --> 02:17:53.000
Hey, crazy, can you hear me?

02:17:53.150 --> 02:17:54.440
Are you listening to me?

02:17:54.450 --> 02:17:57.320
I am afraid of nothing.

02:18:00.700 --> 02:18:05.379
You crazy bitch. You think I'm bullshitting, right?

02:18:12.150 --> 02:18:17.309
Dad. Dad.

02:18:20.700 --> 02:18:25.950
Hey. Hey! Don't open the door!

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:27.770
Dad!

02:18:31.330 --> 02:18:35.500
No, no, don't open the door!

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.950
Sang-hoon! Don't open the door.

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:43.850
What the hell is he doing over there? Stay out of it.

02:18:44.500 --> 02:18:46.299
Don't open the door!

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:50.990
How come it's not opening?

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:55.049
No, no, fuck, why did you come here!?

02:18:55.799 --> 02:18:56.889
Mom.

02:18:56.900 --> 02:18:58.450
Are you in there?

02:18:58.500 --> 02:19:01.950
No. Don't open the door.
