- [ Evan ] I think she's creepy.
- [ Dad ] Evan.

Well, I do. She's always sneaking
around, like she's hiding something.

01:51.767 --> 01:54.700
That's ridiculous. She's a perfectly
nice, slightly eccentric woman.

16:35.533 --> 16:37.567
Too late now.

16:37.567 --> 16:40.000
Way too late.

16:41.467 --> 16:44.100
- Stop!
- [ Katherine ] What is going on here?

16:48.233 --> 16:49.700
[ Gasps ]

16:49.700 --> 16:52.800
- Monster blood.
- [ Rumbling ]

16:53.300 --> 16:54.667
Did I not tell you
to stay out of that room?

16:55.067 --> 16:58.167
- [ Cat Meows ]
- You've unleashed her.

16:58.667 --> 17:00.667
[ Meowing ]

17:00.667 --> 17:02.500
Unleashed who?

17:02.500 --> 17:06.967
- Sarabeth.
- [ Evan ] Who's Sarabeth? That cat?

17:06.967 --> 17:11.233
That, child, is no cat.

17:11.633 --> 17:13.000
[ Meows ]

17:17.867 --> 17:20.867
Silence, old woman.

17:24.099 --> 17:27.032
I see you've met my monster blood.

17:27.032 --> 17:31.033
And now my monster blood...

17:31.033 --> 17:32.667
shall meet you.

17:33.167 --> 17:35.633
- You mean, she's the evil one?
- Clever boy.

17:35.633 --> 17:38.333
- What gave you the first clue?
- [ Andy ] Who is she?

17:38.833 --> 17:41.033
- Why is she doing this?
- Tell them--

17:41.033 --> 17:43.967
Tell them why they're going to be--

17:43.967 --> 17:46.367
- [ Imitates Blade Slashing ]
- [ Aunt Katherine Gasps ]

17:52.367 --> 17:54.133
It was almost 30 years ago.

17:56.233 --> 18:00.133
It was about midnight,
and I smelled something...

18:00.133 --> 18:02.067
- [ Thunderclap ]
- coming from her room.

18:02.067 --> 18:04.400
I-I never would have
taken her on a boarder...

18:04.400 --> 18:08.733
if I-- if I'd known she
was practicing dark magic.

18:08.733 --> 18:11.033
I tried to throw her out,
but I couldn't.

18:11.600 --> 18:13.700
She was too strong,
too powerful.

18:15.133 --> 18:17.333
But I was lucky.

18:17.933 --> 18:21.567
Right when she had me she
stepped into the monster blood.

18:21.567 --> 18:24.033
[ Screaming ]

18:24.033 --> 18:27.233
She screamed like a banshee...

18:27.233 --> 18:30.367
as the monster blood
was consuming her.

18:30.867 --> 18:32.867
Screams so savage--

18:33.367 --> 18:35.100
I can still hear it in my mind.

18:35.100 --> 18:38.500
- [ Screaming Continues ]
- I scooped up the monster blood,

18:38.933 --> 18:42.433
put it back in the jar
and sealed it tightly.

18:42.933 --> 18:45.433
Then I locked it up,

18:45.433 --> 18:48.433
and hoped that no one
would ever find it.

18:48.933 --> 18:52.300
Oh, but someone did find it.

18:52.300 --> 18:57.400
Take them, my monster blood,
take them all.

18:57.900 --> 19:00.267
Devour and demolish them.

19:00.267 --> 19:03.833
Crush them and consume them.
Ahh!

19:05.333 --> 19:07.600
Ah, my monster blood.

19:08.067 --> 19:10.900
- [ Rumbling ]
- Heavens! What's that?

19:11.300 --> 19:14.033
- [ Barking ]
- Trigger!

19:14.033 --> 19:18.900
[ Hissing ]

19:18.900 --> 19:21.233
- Get her, Trigger.
- Nice puppy.

19:21.233 --> 19:24.233
- [ Barking ]
- [ Hissing ]

19:28.100 --> 19:30.600
Yes! Get her!

19:32.600 --> 19:34.600
- Shoo! Shoo!
- [ Barking ]

19:34.600 --> 19:36.633
Get yourself a bone or something.
Go on.

19:36.633 --> 19:39.433
- Go on, shoo. Shoo!
- [ Gasping ]

19:40.833 --> 19:42.633
No!

19:44.133 --> 19:45.933
No! Not again!

19:46.367 --> 19:48.700
Oh, no!

19:48.700 --> 19:51.433
[ Rumbling ]

19:51.933 --> 19:53.867
Ohh!

19:54.367 --> 19:56.033
What a relief.

19:56.533 --> 19:59.800
[ Evan ]
Trigger! Oh, you saved us.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.133
[ Evan ] And that was the end
of the wicked Sarabeth.

20:02.633 --> 20:05.633
Now I'm going to Atlanta
to meet up with my parents.

20:06.133 --> 20:08.133
- Is that all true?
- Every word.

20:08.133 --> 20:09.633
- [ Bell Dings ]
- [ Man On PA ] Well, folks, looks like...

20:09.633 --> 20:11.633
we finally got clearance
from the tower.

20:12.133 --> 20:13.800
Flight attendants,
prepare for takeoff.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.500
Well, what happened
to the monster blood?

20:16.500 --> 20:18.500
Once we got it back into the jar,

20:18.500 --> 20:20.633
we buried it where no one
would ever find it.

20:21.133 --> 20:22.133
I hope you got it all.

20:22.133 --> 20:24.567
Can you imagine if a little piece
had stuck to your shoe?

20:24.567 --> 20:28.067
- That would be a disaster.
- Ah, it wouldn't be good.

20:28.567 --> 20:30.567
Where's your dog?
Where's Trigger?

20:31.067 --> 20:32.567
- Oh, he's here.
- On the plane?

20:33.067 --> 20:35.567
Mm-hmm.
He's down in the cargo hold.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.567
- [ Engines Whining ]
- Here we go.

20:39.067 --> 20:40.667
Are you okay?

20:41.167 --> 20:44.167
- Flying makes me nervous.
- Don't worry.

20:44.167 --> 20:46.667
I'm sure we're gonna have
a perfectly normal flight.

20:46.667 --> 20:49.167
[ Rattling ]

21:00.433 --> 21:03.733
[ Barking ]

21:04.233 --> 21:06.233
[ Whimpering ]

21:09.133 --> 21:11.467
[ Barking ]
