00:01.568 --> 00:05.572
(theme music playing)

00:07.000 --> 00:13.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:24.651 --> 01:25.652
Right.

01:32.659 --> 01:33.660
Good morning.
Good morning.

01:47.674 --> 01:51.177
(beeping)

01:53.680 --> 01:55.682
Take a look at what
our eye-in-the-sky has to say.

01:55.682 --> 01:57.183
What're they
calling her?

01:57.183 --> 01:58.184
Henry.

01:58.184 --> 01:59.686
200 miles across,

01:59.686 --> 02:01.688
and we're headed
right down his throat.

02:01.688 --> 02:03.690
I think our
passengers might object.

02:03.690 --> 02:05.692
Not exactly
vacation weather.

02:05.692 --> 02:07.193
Make a course adjustment

02:07.193 --> 02:09.696
and see if we can skirt
Henry's west perimeter.

02:09.696 --> 02:11.698
(phone buzzes)

02:11.698 --> 02:12.699
Bridge.

02:12.699 --> 02:14.701
Right away. Patch him through.

02:14.701 --> 02:16.202
It's the home office
for you, Captain.

02:16.202 --> 02:18.705
Captain Howard
aboard theVictoria.

02:18.705 --> 02:20.206
Control, over.

02:23.710 --> 02:25.211
I'll check it
out personally.

02:25.211 --> 02:27.213
This is theVictoria.

02:27.213 --> 02:29.215
(beeping)

02:29.716 --> 02:30.717
What is it?

02:30.717 --> 02:31.718
Bomb threat.

02:33.720 --> 02:34.721
Take over the bridge.

02:34.721 --> 02:36.222
Notify Henshaw and
Neilson to meet me

02:36.222 --> 02:38.224
at the weather fax
compartment immediately.

02:38.224 --> 02:39.225
Yes, sir.

02:47.734 --> 02:50.236
(beeping)

02:51.738 --> 02:53.239
What was that?

02:54.741 --> 02:58.244
(alarm blaring)

03:08.254 --> 03:10.757
MacGYVER:
Sure is great
to start off a sunny day

03:10.757 --> 03:12.759
thinking about
the people you like most.

03:12.759 --> 03:14.761
My pal, Susan, for instance.

03:14.761 --> 03:18.765
She's my landlady, the
building maintenance person,

03:18.765 --> 03:20.767
and the only human being
who's figured out

03:20.767 --> 03:23.269
how to keep me organized. So,

03:23.269 --> 03:25.271
how do I repay her?

03:25.271 --> 03:26.773
A 21st century

03:26.773 --> 03:29.275
breakfast, of course.

03:29.275 --> 03:31.277
I wonder how
she likes her eggs.

03:31.277 --> 03:33.279
Okay, Susan,thisis the future.

03:33.279 --> 03:34.280
Uh-huh.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.282
Or part of it anyway.

03:36.282 --> 03:38.785
I think I'll hang loose
here in the past.

03:38.785 --> 03:39.786
It might be safer.

03:39.786 --> 03:40.787
Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh.

03:47.293 --> 03:49.796
First thing we have to do
is get the fridge open.

03:49.796 --> 03:50.797
There it goes.

03:50.797 --> 03:51.798
SUSAN:
Okay.

03:51.798 --> 03:53.299
That's a start.
What's next?

03:55.802 --> 03:57.804
Now we put Roboter to work.

03:57.804 --> 03:59.305
(whirring)

03:59.305 --> 04:00.306
Isn't she great?

04:00.306 --> 04:02.308
Let's not go
straight to "great."

04:02.308 --> 04:03.810
After all, I did
just meet her.

04:06.312 --> 04:09.315
Let me guess-- you
like 'em scrambled.

04:11.818 --> 04:13.319
Just watch.

04:13.319 --> 04:14.821
Right to the pot.

04:22.328 --> 04:23.830
Right to the pot, Mac?

04:25.832 --> 04:27.333
Oh.

04:28.334 --> 04:30.336
Love that modern technology.

04:30.837 --> 04:32.839
It needs a couple
of adjustments, I guess.

04:32.839 --> 04:34.340
I guess.

04:34.340 --> 04:36.342
I'm not safe in the
past here either.

04:36.342 --> 04:37.844
(phone ringing)

04:37.844 --> 04:39.846
Incredible timing.

04:39.846 --> 04:40.847
Mmm.

04:43.850 --> 04:45.852
Whoever you are, I owe
an incredible debt of...

04:45.852 --> 04:46.853
THORNTON:
MacGyver?

04:46.853 --> 04:47.854
...gratitude.

04:48.354 --> 04:50.356
Good, I'll take it-- right now.

04:50.356 --> 04:51.858
Peter?

04:51.858 --> 04:53.860
On second thought...

04:53.860 --> 04:54.861
Now, hold it.

04:54.861 --> 04:56.863
Mac, I've got a job for you.

04:56.863 --> 04:59.866
Pete, I'm on the verge
of a great discovery.

04:59.866 --> 05:01.868
(Susan chuckles)
Sure, you are.

05:01.868 --> 05:03.369
The world's just waiting

05:03.369 --> 05:06.372
to find out
about shoe polish egg foo yung.

05:06.372 --> 05:07.373
What was that?

05:07.373 --> 05:09.375
It's my cranky maintenance lady

05:09.375 --> 05:11.878
being her usual self; cranky.

05:11.878 --> 05:12.879
Mac, I need your help.

05:12.879 --> 05:14.881
Last time you said that to me,

05:14.881 --> 05:18.384
I ended up in Washington wearing
a pin-stripe suit and a necktie.

05:18.384 --> 05:20.386
Yeah, well,
that was a show-and-tell.

05:20.386 --> 05:21.888
This is for real.

05:21.888 --> 05:22.889
It's important.

05:22.889 --> 05:24.390
How important?

05:24.390 --> 05:26.392
Well, a cruise ship
in the north Pacific

05:26.392 --> 05:28.895
with 1,100 passengers
and a bomb threat

05:28.895 --> 05:31.397
from some clown
calling himself Viking.

05:31.397 --> 05:32.398
How's that?

05:32.398 --> 05:34.901
You make it kinda tough
for a guy to say no.

05:34.901 --> 05:35.902
Team briefing

05:35.902 --> 05:37.403
at my place. I think I'll have

05:37.403 --> 05:39.906
at least one
pleasant surprise for you.

05:39.906 --> 05:41.908
Get here as fast
as possible, will you?

05:41.908 --> 05:42.909
MacGYVER:
See you then.

05:48.915 --> 05:51.417
I had this contract
with Pete Thornton's outfit

05:51.417 --> 05:54.921
that says I take only
those jobs I want to take.

05:54.921 --> 05:57.924
Now, you'd think
I'd say no once in a while,

05:57.924 --> 05:59.425
especially when Pete wants

05:59.425 --> 06:02.428
to put me in the middle of
the ocean to baby-sit a bomb,

06:02.929 --> 06:04.430
but, no.

06:04.931 --> 06:06.432
Somehow he always seems

06:06.432 --> 06:08.434
to come up
with a convincing argument,

06:08.434 --> 06:11.437
and then he holds out
a carrot like this...

06:11.437 --> 06:13.439
"special surprise."

06:13.439 --> 06:14.440
Charlie!

06:15.942 --> 06:18.444
Charlie Robinson?!

06:19.445 --> 06:20.446
MacGyver?
Is that you?

06:20.947 --> 06:21.948
I don't believe it.

06:21.948 --> 06:23.449
Charlie.

06:23.449 --> 06:24.450
Good to see you.

06:24.450 --> 06:25.451
How you been?

06:25.451 --> 06:26.953
Good, good, real good.

06:26.953 --> 06:27.954
How's Shirley?

06:27.954 --> 06:29.455
Well, lately, Mac,
Shirley's been

06:29.956 --> 06:31.457
a little bit
under the weather.

06:31.457 --> 06:32.959
Darned near every morning.

06:34.460 --> 06:35.461
You're kidding.

06:36.462 --> 06:37.964
That's terrific.

06:37.964 --> 06:39.465
Congratulations, Pop.

06:39.966 --> 06:40.466
Hey, thanks
a lot, Mac.

06:40.967 --> 06:41.968
You know, we've
been trying

06:41.968 --> 06:43.469
a long time, and it
finally happened.

06:43.469 --> 06:45.471
That's terrific.

06:45.972 --> 06:46.973
What're you doinghere?

06:46.973 --> 06:49.976
Well, what is it you
always say? Um...

06:49.976 --> 06:51.477
Too big to talk about?

06:51.477 --> 06:52.979
You haven't been
talking to a guy

06:52.979 --> 06:54.480
named Peter Thornton,
have you?

06:54.480 --> 06:56.482
You got called up
for this one, too?

06:56.482 --> 06:57.483
This is great.

06:57.483 --> 06:58.985
This is great.
Charlie, you get back

06:58.985 --> 07:00.486
in your car
and you go back home.

07:00.486 --> 07:01.487
Uh-uh-uh.

07:01.487 --> 07:02.989
This one's gonna
bail your old dad out.

07:02.989 --> 07:05.992
You know, Uncle Sam found me in
the Computer Expert file of his

07:05.992 --> 07:08.995
and put $25,000
on the counter.

07:08.995 --> 07:10.496
Look, Charlie,

07:10.496 --> 07:12.999
this isn't you
and me in 'Nam,

07:12.999 --> 07:14.500
and there wasn't
a Shirley

07:14.500 --> 07:17.003
or a little one
on the way back then, either.

07:17.003 --> 07:18.004
Yeah, I know, I know,

07:18.004 --> 07:20.506
and there wasn't a supply
company and a home mortgage

07:20.506 --> 07:22.508
looking bankruptcy
square in the face.

07:22.508 --> 07:24.510
Ah-ah-ah-ah.

07:24.510 --> 07:25.511
Nothing more to say.

07:25.511 --> 07:26.512
I'm in.

07:26.512 --> 07:28.014
Come on.

07:28.014 --> 07:30.016
You got a screw loose,
you know that?

07:30.016 --> 07:32.018
So? What else is new?

07:32.018 --> 07:33.519
(laughing)

07:41.027 --> 07:42.028
Suspects.

07:42.028 --> 07:43.529
50 to start.

07:43.529 --> 07:44.530
More to run down.

07:44.530 --> 07:46.032
Any priority
you want set up?

07:46.032 --> 07:48.534
I recruited you to do
a job on this, Mike.

07:48.534 --> 07:51.037
It's yours, the best way
you see getting it done.

07:51.037 --> 07:52.038
That's all I
need to hear.

07:52.038 --> 07:53.539
Carlyle, let's get
an EPIC link-up

07:54.040 --> 07:55.541
with Central East
and Southwest regions.

07:55.541 --> 07:57.043
I want a profile
on these guys.

07:57.043 --> 07:58.544
M.O.'s smoking the wires.

07:58.544 --> 08:00.546
MacGYVER:
Doggone it, Pete.

08:00.546 --> 08:03.049
Charlie's got
no business taking this gig.

08:03.049 --> 08:04.050
You're Peter Thornton.

08:04.050 --> 08:05.551
Charlie Robinson--

08:05.551 --> 08:06.552
and ignore him.

08:07.053 --> 08:08.054
He has this
irrepressible

08:08.054 --> 08:10.056
paternal instinct toward me.

08:10.056 --> 08:11.057
Mac, what is it?

08:11.057 --> 08:12.558
You guys were in 'Nam together.

08:12.558 --> 08:15.561
You were a bomb-
diffusing team, right?

08:15.561 --> 08:16.562
Only the best.

08:16.562 --> 08:19.565
Okay, coordination
and control come from here.

08:19.565 --> 08:22.068
We've got direct communications
with theVictoria.

08:22.068 --> 08:24.570
They've got a search going
for the bomb right now.

08:24.570 --> 08:26.572
What's the threat
assessment?

08:26.572 --> 08:28.074
Well, there was
a warning bomb

08:28.574 --> 08:29.575
that wiped out
the weather room

08:29.575 --> 08:31.077
and killed
the captain.

08:31.077 --> 08:32.578
Come here.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.082
There is a, uh,
storm front moving in

08:36.082 --> 08:37.582
that makes it
impossible

08:37.582 --> 08:39.585
to put the passengers
into lifeboats.

08:39.585 --> 08:41.087
What about sea
or air rescue?

08:41.087 --> 08:42.087
THORNTON:
No way.

08:42.087 --> 08:43.089
There are no ships

08:43.089 --> 08:44.590
or air rescue units close enough

08:45.091 --> 08:47.593
to get to theVictoriabefore
she's into the typhoon zone.

08:47.593 --> 08:49.095
ROBINSON:
So how do we
get there?

08:49.095 --> 08:51.097
Take a bus?
No, you take

08:51.097 --> 08:52.598
a jet to Midway
and a Huey chopper

08:52.598 --> 08:54.100
the rest of the way to the ship.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.102
Pete, given
any consideration

08:56.602 --> 08:58.604
to tracking down
this bomber?

08:58.604 --> 08:59.605
Oh, we're on that,

08:59.605 --> 09:01.607
with an expert--
Mike Donahue.

09:01.607 --> 09:03.609
No, sir, we just
can't figure it out.

09:03.609 --> 09:04.610
Donahue? There
was a Donahue

09:05.111 --> 09:07.113
that ran the 227 Bomb
Squad out of Da Nang.

09:07.113 --> 09:08.614
Couple of years
before our time.

09:08.614 --> 09:10.116
Well, that's him.

09:10.116 --> 09:13.119
Medical discharge and back
in the Police Department.

09:13.119 --> 09:14.120
He runs one of the best

09:14.120 --> 09:17.123
bomb investigation units
in the country. Mike?

09:17.123 --> 09:18.124
They've located the bomb.

09:18.124 --> 09:20.126
Near theVictoria'sengine room.

09:20.126 --> 09:22.628
Disguised as an
electrical cabinet,

09:22.628 --> 09:25.131
two feet across,
three feet in height,

09:25.131 --> 09:26.632
below the water line.

09:26.632 --> 09:28.634
Threat assessment verified, eh?

09:28.634 --> 09:31.137
You the guys that get
to find out how it ticks?

09:31.137 --> 09:33.139
Oh, uh, MacGyver,
Robinson-- Mike Donahue.

09:33.139 --> 09:34.140
Heard a lot about you.

09:35.141 --> 09:36.142
Only the best.

09:36.142 --> 09:37.143
Thank you.

09:37.143 --> 09:39.145
That's what the man said
about you guys.

09:39.145 --> 09:41.647
The question is,
how good is this Viking?

09:41.647 --> 09:43.649
Patch from shipping
headquarters coming through.

09:44.150 --> 09:45.151
Viking's on the line.

09:45.151 --> 09:46.152
Put it on the P.A.

09:46.152 --> 09:47.653
Start a trace.

09:47.653 --> 09:49.155
(distorted man's voice):
Good morning.

09:49.155 --> 09:51.657
This is Viking.

09:51.657 --> 09:53.659
You will be interested
to know that I am aware

09:53.659 --> 09:55.161
that Mr. Thornton
is listening in

09:55.661 --> 09:57.163
from his headquarters.
In fact, I know

09:57.163 --> 09:59.665
all about your efforts,
Mr. Thornton, and the experts

09:59.665 --> 10:02.668
you have recruited to stop me.

10:02.668 --> 10:08.674
Donahue. How's the leg, Donahue,
the one you lost in Vietnam?

10:08.674 --> 10:10.176
Robinson?

10:10.176 --> 10:12.678
Congratulations
on the upcoming baby,

10:12.678 --> 10:16.182
and, of course, your ex-partner,
the inventive Mr. MacGyver.

10:16.182 --> 10:18.684
Hey, Pete, nice security.

10:18.684 --> 10:20.186
Mac, I don't want to hear it.

10:20.186 --> 10:23.689
The bomb is set
to go off at 6:30 p.m.,

10:23.689 --> 10:26.192
your time, ten
and one half hours from now.

10:26.192 --> 10:28.194
The way to stop the bomb

10:28.194 --> 10:30.696
is to put together
$6 million and deliver it.

10:30.696 --> 10:32.198
The switching station at Proctor

10:32.198 --> 10:33.699
puts the call
somewhere in Westwood.

10:33.699 --> 10:35.701
Notify all field units.

10:35.701 --> 10:37.703
Please, don't disappoint me.

10:37.703 --> 10:38.704
(dial tone)

10:41.207 --> 10:43.209
Damn.

10:44.710 --> 10:45.711
6:30.

10:46.212 --> 10:47.213
It's a five-hour flight
to Midway,

10:47.213 --> 10:49.715
another two and a half hours
on the chopper.

10:49.715 --> 10:51.217
That gives us about three hours

10:51.217 --> 10:52.718
to work on the bomb
once we get there.

11:04.730 --> 11:07.733
MAN 1:
This is Whiskey Sierra Bravo
to Midway Tower.

11:07.733 --> 11:11.737
Requesting confirmation on a
stand-by chopper for bomb team.

11:11.737 --> 11:14.240
MAN 2:
Midway Tower. We copy,
Whiskey Sierra Bravo.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.742
Proceed directly to helipad
for immediate liftoff.

11:24.250 --> 11:27.253
Ah, the tools of our old trade.

11:27.253 --> 11:30.256
Boy, these bring back
a few memories.

11:30.256 --> 11:33.759
Yeah, like the time you hocked
'em for a night out in Saigon.

11:33.759 --> 11:35.261
Only the essentials, MacGyver.

11:35.261 --> 11:36.762
And if I remember right,

11:36.762 --> 11:39.265
you had one of your most
memorable evenings

11:39.265 --> 11:40.266
in the French Quarter.

11:40.266 --> 11:41.767
Oui, monsieur.

11:41.767 --> 11:44.270
Victoria'sdead ahead.

11:46.772 --> 11:48.774
We'll have to cable you down.

11:48.774 --> 11:49.775
Then I'm out of here.

11:49.775 --> 11:52.278
No telling when that
storm will roll in.

11:52.278 --> 11:54.780
Let's start with
your bag of bomb tools.

11:54.780 --> 11:56.782
It'll help me line up
on wind direction.

12:09.295 --> 12:13.799
(excited chatter)

12:13.799 --> 12:15.301
I want you to cordon
this area off

12:15.301 --> 12:17.303
and keep the passengers
way back.

12:17.303 --> 12:18.304
Yes, ma'am.

12:18.304 --> 12:20.306
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.

12:20.306 --> 12:22.808
Could you clear
this area, please?

12:25.311 --> 12:27.813
Okay, boys, I've got cable
control in the cockpit.

12:27.813 --> 12:28.814
Let her go.

12:39.825 --> 12:41.827
MacGYVER:
Bob, we got
a winch malfunction.

12:43.329 --> 12:44.830
I can't override, Mac.

12:46.332 --> 12:48.834
ROBINSON:
Mac, we're going
to lose our tools.

12:48.834 --> 12:50.836
MacGYVER:
Correction, Charlie.
They're already gone.

12:50.836 --> 12:53.339
They've lost their cable.
They'll never make it.
They have to.

12:54.840 --> 12:57.343
ROBINSON:
Mac, that bomb's not
waiting for anybody.

13:01.347 --> 13:02.848
A little more
than three hours--

13:03.349 --> 13:04.850
that's all
we have left.

13:20.366 --> 13:21.367
Where you going, Mac?

13:21.367 --> 13:23.369
MacGYVER:
Well, we can't
just sit up here

13:23.369 --> 13:24.870
and look like a bunch
of dummies.

13:24.870 --> 13:26.872
What do you say
we work out a way

13:26.872 --> 13:29.375
to turn this cargo net
into something useful?

13:29.375 --> 13:30.876
You mean like
a rappelling line?

13:30.876 --> 13:32.378
Yeah, something like that.

13:32.378 --> 13:35.381
Mac, you're a wonder,
a true wonder.

13:39.385 --> 13:41.887
Just survival, Charlie.

13:48.394 --> 13:49.895
Hand me that
carabiner, will you?

13:54.900 --> 13:58.404
Listen, you can still go back
to Midway on the chopper.

13:58.404 --> 14:00.406
And miss a ride like this?

14:00.406 --> 14:02.408
I think not.

14:02.408 --> 14:04.410
Hang on to that for me,
will you, Bob?

14:05.411 --> 14:08.414
Pick a number between
one and ten. Quick.

14:08.414 --> 14:09.415
Seven.

14:09.415 --> 14:10.916
Close, but wrong. I go first.

14:10.916 --> 14:11.917
Hold her steady, Bob.

14:11.917 --> 14:13.419
We want to keep him dry.

14:13.919 --> 14:14.920
BOB:
I'll vote for that.

14:15.421 --> 14:16.422
Give me the count

14:16.422 --> 14:17.423
when ready.

14:17.423 --> 14:18.424
Hooking up.

14:26.432 --> 14:28.434
He's on the rail.
Stand by.

14:30.436 --> 14:31.437
Bomb's away, Charlie.

14:33.939 --> 14:35.941
Go, Mac.

14:35.941 --> 14:38.944
(people gasping)

14:50.456 --> 14:51.457
Contact Control.

14:51.457 --> 14:53.459
Tell them they're on board.
Right.

14:55.961 --> 14:58.464
I'm Carole Tanner, acting
captain of theVictoria.

14:58.464 --> 14:59.465
Captain, name's MacGyver.

14:59.465 --> 15:00.966
This is Charlie Robinson.

15:00.966 --> 15:01.967
Captain.

15:01.967 --> 15:03.469
The red cargo bag.

15:03.469 --> 15:04.970
Was it important?

15:04.970 --> 15:07.973
Well, that kind of depends
on the bomb, ma'am.

15:07.973 --> 15:08.974
Can we get to it?

15:08.974 --> 15:11.977
Engine room.
Follow me.

15:15.981 --> 15:18.484
Captain, what have you
told the passengers?

15:18.484 --> 15:19.985
As little as possible.

15:22.488 --> 15:26.992
MacGYVER:
How long you planning on keeping
the passengers in the dark

15:26.992 --> 15:28.494
about all this?

15:28.494 --> 15:30.996
TANNER:
We're trying to steer
around a typhoon

15:30.996 --> 15:33.499
which prohibits any thought
of using lifeboats.

15:33.499 --> 15:35.501
And there's
a bomb on board.

15:35.501 --> 15:39.004
What do you suggest I do,
Mr. MacGyver, create panic?

15:39.004 --> 15:41.006
Well, if it was me,
I'd be awfully curious,

15:41.006 --> 15:43.008
especially with Charlie
and me coming on board

15:43.008 --> 15:45.511
a couple hours after
that first bomb went off.

15:45.511 --> 15:48.514
Well, tell me, Mr. MacGyver,
would you want to know

15:48.514 --> 15:50.516
that a very good
possibility exists

15:50.516 --> 15:52.518
that you could die
a violent death

15:52.518 --> 15:54.019
sometime during
the next three hours?

15:57.022 --> 15:58.524
Yes, ma'am, I would.

16:12.538 --> 16:14.540
That's it.

16:14.540 --> 16:17.543
We're convinced it was placed
during dry dock last month.

16:17.543 --> 16:20.045
It wasn't really seen until
we started looking for it.

16:20.045 --> 16:22.047
Ooh, looks just like
it belongs here.

16:22.047 --> 16:25.050
Yeah, until you
pull this panel off...
Don't touch that.

16:25.050 --> 16:26.051
It's okay.

16:26.051 --> 16:30.055
Our electrical engineer saw it
was the bomb after he opened it.

16:30.055 --> 16:32.057
We've touched nothing else.

16:32.057 --> 16:34.560
(whistles)

16:34.560 --> 16:37.062
Do you believe this?

16:39.565 --> 16:41.567
This guy is no amateur.

16:41.567 --> 16:44.069
ROBINSON:
Oh, just look at those
bomb triggers, Mac.

16:44.570 --> 16:45.571
Uh-huh.

16:45.571 --> 16:47.573
Mechanical,
electrical,
chemical.

16:47.573 --> 16:49.575
Get through one,
you got another.

16:49.575 --> 16:52.578
And pray that we
take them out in
the right sequence.

16:52.578 --> 16:53.579
Here.

16:53.579 --> 16:55.080
The connection
to Mr. Thornton

16:55.080 --> 16:56.081
in Los Angeles
is ready.

16:59.585 --> 17:00.586
Pete?

17:00.586 --> 17:02.588
Yo, Pete?

17:02.588 --> 17:04.089
Yeah? Mac?

17:04.089 --> 17:05.590
I can hear you.

17:05.590 --> 17:07.593
How's it look?

17:07.593 --> 17:09.595
Well, this one looks like
it's going to be a maze

17:09.595 --> 17:11.597
of triggers before we get
to the real thing.

17:11.597 --> 17:12.598
Mike, are you

17:12.598 --> 17:14.599
hooked up to the NCIC
bomb file?

17:14.599 --> 17:17.603
Right. Just call out the trigger
M.O.'s, we'll track 'em.

17:17.603 --> 17:19.104
That's a good idea, Mac.

17:19.104 --> 17:21.106
Well, I just hope it pays off.

17:21.106 --> 17:23.108
Now this first one
I'm looking at.

17:23.108 --> 17:26.111
we ran across
a whole bunch in 'Nam.

17:26.111 --> 17:27.112
Yeah,

17:27.112 --> 17:28.614
the Ling Chow bomber.

17:28.614 --> 17:30.115
Oh boy.

17:30.115 --> 17:31.116
Well, I know his technology.

17:31.116 --> 17:33.619
You're looking at some kind
of chemical detonator.

17:33.619 --> 17:35.120
Yeah, powder in a dish.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.622
Um...

17:36.622 --> 17:39.124
Sodium? It could be sodium?

17:39.124 --> 17:40.125
Well, it could be,

17:40.125 --> 17:43.128
but I don't see any source
of water to set it off.

17:43.629 --> 17:46.131
It's sitting below a heat
sensitive thermocouple,

17:46.131 --> 17:47.633
little blue light on it.

17:47.633 --> 17:51.136
Boy, dishful of some kind
of powdered chemical.

17:51.136 --> 17:52.638
Geez, it could be anything.
Well, it's a start.

17:52.638 --> 17:55.140
Okay, guys, one list of Ling
Chow bomber types coming up.

17:55.140 --> 17:59.645
Well, partner, who scrubs
and who assists?

17:59.645 --> 18:00.646
Pick a number.

18:00.646 --> 18:03.148
Uh, Captain?

18:03.148 --> 18:04.149
Ma'am?
Hmm?

18:04.149 --> 18:06.151
Oh, uh, yes,
Mr. Atkins.

18:06.151 --> 18:08.153
We found another bomb.

18:08.153 --> 18:10.656
D Deck, compartment six.

18:10.656 --> 18:12.157
Where exactly is this D Deck?

18:16.662 --> 18:19.665
Okay, we're here below
the waterline,

18:19.665 --> 18:22.167
and that's D Deck,
compartment six.

18:22.167 --> 18:24.169
Opposite ends of the ship.

18:24.670 --> 18:26.171
Could be synched
to go off at the same time.

18:26.171 --> 18:28.674
I'm counting down from
three hours, six minutes.

18:28.674 --> 18:30.175
Well, partner,
looks like we both scrub.

18:31.677 --> 18:33.178
How can I help?

18:33.178 --> 18:35.681
Uh, just hold a steady course

18:35.681 --> 18:38.684
and think positive thoughts.

18:38.684 --> 18:39.685
I'll do that...

18:39.685 --> 18:43.188
as soon as I've had
a talk with the passengers.

18:56.201 --> 19:00.706
Well, it's just
you and me now.

19:07.212 --> 19:09.214
Now hear this.

19:09.214 --> 19:11.717
This is the captain speaking

19:11.717 --> 19:14.720
with an important message
for all passengers.

19:14.720 --> 19:18.223
The explosion that killed
Captain Howard six hours ago

19:18.223 --> 19:20.726
was the beginning
of a grotesque threat

19:20.726 --> 19:23.729
made upon all of us
aboard theVictoria.

19:28.233 --> 19:30.235
That's it.

19:30.235 --> 19:32.237
Good luck.

19:38.744 --> 19:39.745
Mac,

19:39.745 --> 19:40.746
can you read me?

19:40.746 --> 19:42.748
Yeah, loud and clear.

19:44.750 --> 19:47.252
Viking must have had
a field day in dry dock.

19:47.252 --> 19:51.256
Is your bomb built into a phony
electrical panel like this one?

19:51.256 --> 19:55.260
Yep. All the triggers are
behind a sealed glass cover.

19:55.260 --> 19:57.763
I've got an exact copy
of yours up here.

19:57.763 --> 20:00.265
This stuff around the edge...

20:01.767 --> 20:03.769
looks like some kind
of booby trap.

20:09.274 --> 20:11.276
Plastic explosive, maybe?

20:11.276 --> 20:14.780
No, I'd say it's some kind
of a silicon base.

20:14.780 --> 20:17.282
Probably a sealer of some kind.

20:17.282 --> 20:19.284
Well, whatever.

20:19.284 --> 20:20.285
We've got to get inside.

20:20.285 --> 20:21.787
We're counting down fast.

20:21.787 --> 20:23.789
Well, don't push it, Charlie.

20:23.789 --> 20:25.290
We don't want
to rush things here.

20:25.290 --> 20:28.293
I got a hunch that's exactly
what Viking wants us to do.

20:28.293 --> 20:30.796
(distorted man's voice):
This is Viking.

20:30.796 --> 20:32.798
I assume you found
the second bomb by now

20:32.798 --> 20:34.800
and have gathered
the $6 million.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.802
So listen closely.

20:36.802 --> 20:39.805
You must realize that you
do not have either the time

20:39.805 --> 20:41.306
or intelligence
to stop my bombs.

20:41.807 --> 20:42.808
Only I can stop it,

20:43.308 --> 20:45.310
provided you do
exactly what I tell you.

20:45.811 --> 20:48.814
If my instructions are not
carried out precisely,

20:48.814 --> 20:50.816
you will not hear from me again,

20:50.816 --> 20:53.819
and you will not learn
how to disarm the bombs.

20:53.819 --> 20:55.821
You will put the money
in a briefcase

20:55.821 --> 20:59.825
and place it in locker number
324 at the downtown bus depot.

20:59.825 --> 21:02.828
And, gentlemen, it will be both
futile and dangerous

21:02.828 --> 21:04.329
to try to locate me.

21:04.329 --> 21:05.330
Carlyle?

21:05.831 --> 21:06.832
No trace.

21:06.832 --> 21:08.834
He knows exactly
what he's doing.

21:14.339 --> 21:18.844
THORNTON:
MacGyver, Robinson, we've got
a dead end on the trace.

21:18.844 --> 21:20.846
No Ling Chow suspects.

21:20.846 --> 21:22.848
I'm gonna go ahead
with the money drop.

21:24.349 --> 21:25.851
Do you hear that, Charlie?

21:25.851 --> 21:26.852
ROBINSON:
Yep, but suppose Viking

21:26.852 --> 21:28.854
doesn't live up to
his end of the bargain?

21:28.854 --> 21:30.856
MacGYVER:
Well, what do you suggest?

21:30.856 --> 21:32.858
ROBINSON:
I'm suggesting maybe Viking
won't tell us

21:32.858 --> 21:35.360
how to turn this thing off.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.362
So we can't sit around and wait.

21:37.362 --> 21:38.864
Pick a number, Mac.

21:38.864 --> 21:40.365
Uh, no, n-no, no, no.

21:40.365 --> 21:41.867
We played that game already.

21:41.867 --> 21:45.370
I guess that means
it's my turn to go first then.

21:45.370 --> 21:47.372
You just follow in my footsteps,

21:47.372 --> 21:48.874
partner.

21:48.874 --> 21:50.876
All right.

21:50.876 --> 21:54.880
But, Charlie, remember
the routine in 'Nam--

21:54.880 --> 21:56.882
by the numbers.

21:56.882 --> 21:59.885
Slow and easy,
and we'll live forever.

22:00.385 --> 22:02.888
By the numbers.

22:10.395 --> 22:11.897
Call it out, Charlie.

22:11.897 --> 22:13.398
What's your benchmark?

22:13.398 --> 22:15.901
All right, take it down
this way.

22:15.901 --> 22:18.904
I'm gonna probe the gasket
that runs around the outside

22:18.904 --> 22:20.405
of the bomb casing.

22:20.405 --> 22:22.908
The one you think
is a silicone base.

22:23.909 --> 22:26.912
I'm using a dental probe
from the ship's doctor.

22:26.912 --> 22:28.914
It's a number three.

22:28.914 --> 22:32.417
I'm sealing the entry
with petroleum jelly.

22:36.421 --> 22:39.424
I'm penetrating the seal.

22:39.424 --> 22:40.425
The chemical in that dish

22:40.425 --> 22:42.427
could be any one
of a number of things.

22:42.427 --> 22:43.428
ROBINSON:
I just need to touch it.

22:43.428 --> 22:45.931
Get one sample to test.
Then we'll know.

22:45.931 --> 22:49.935
If I could just reach that dish.

23:05.951 --> 23:07.452
I'm getting there.

23:07.452 --> 23:08.954
I'm getting there, Mac.

23:08.954 --> 23:10.956
Hey, easy, easy, Charlie.

23:11.957 --> 23:12.958
(hissing)

23:12.958 --> 23:14.960
It's a vacuum, Mac!

23:14.960 --> 23:16.461
It's a vacuum!

23:16.461 --> 23:18.463
You've gotta fill...!

23:18.463 --> 23:19.464
Charlie!

23:19.464 --> 23:20.966
(static)

23:20.966 --> 23:22.968
Charlie...

23:30.575 --> 23:32.577
All right, damage control

23:32.577 --> 23:34.079
has the area
isolated and secure.

23:34.079 --> 23:37.082
The affected compartment
is shut tight and holding.

23:37.082 --> 23:40.585
Now, I want lifeboats ready
and a lifeboat drill scheduled.

23:40.585 --> 23:42.087
The passengers
will be briefed then.

23:42.087 --> 23:43.588
Right.

23:49.094 --> 23:50.595
Are you okay?

23:55.600 --> 23:56.601
You know, Charlie and I

23:56.601 --> 23:59.604
busted 51 bombs
together in Vietnam.

23:59.604 --> 24:01.106
My God.

24:01.106 --> 24:02.607
Charlie used to put
a little scratch

24:02.607 --> 24:03.608
on the wall above our bunks

24:03.608 --> 24:06.111
every time we'd get back
from doing one.

24:06.111 --> 24:08.113
We used to tell anyone
who would listen

24:08.613 --> 24:10.115
that we were going
for the record.

24:10.115 --> 24:12.617
The day we shipped out,
he counted 'em.

24:12.617 --> 24:14.619
51.

24:14.619 --> 24:17.122
Then he laughed, just laughed.

24:17.122 --> 24:19.624
I'm sorry.

24:19.624 --> 24:21.126
If we get out of this one,

24:21.126 --> 24:23.128
it's because Charlie
figured out number 52

24:23.128 --> 24:25.630
in the split second
before he died.

24:25.630 --> 24:26.631
I don't understand.

24:27.132 --> 24:29.134
He yelled "vacuum."

24:29.134 --> 24:31.636
That whole bomb is in a vacuum.

24:31.636 --> 24:33.138
The chemical is phosphorus,

24:33.138 --> 24:35.640
triggered to explode
when air hits it.

24:35.640 --> 24:40.145
The phosphorus flashed,
tripped a thermocouple,

24:40.145 --> 24:41.146
and that was that.

24:41.146 --> 24:44.149
But, but if the bomb
is built inside a vacuum,

24:44.149 --> 24:46.651
then there's no way you can
take that glass face off

24:46.651 --> 24:48.153
without air getting in.

24:48.153 --> 24:51.656
Unless I fill that vacuum
with something else.

24:51.656 --> 24:53.158
Like?

24:53.158 --> 24:55.660
You got any neon signs
on board?

24:55.660 --> 24:57.162
The search party
found another one.

24:57.662 --> 24:59.664
In the auxiliary power room.

25:00.165 --> 25:01.666
You got two
neon signs?

25:01.666 --> 25:02.667
This is becoming insane.

25:03.168 --> 25:04.669
How many more can there be?

25:04.669 --> 25:05.670
Well, we're sure
of the two

25:06.171 --> 25:08.173
and there's no reason to believe
they're not in sequence,

25:08.173 --> 25:09.674
so we're gonna have
to disarm them simultaneously.

25:09.674 --> 25:11.676
I can't be in
two places at once,

25:12.177 --> 25:14.179
so I'm gonna need
a new partner.

25:14.179 --> 25:16.181
Any likely candidates on board?

25:16.181 --> 25:17.682
Me.
I'll do it.

25:17.682 --> 25:18.683
Carole.

25:18.683 --> 25:20.685
I mean, Captain.

25:20.685 --> 25:22.187
The whole ship
is your responsibility.

25:22.187 --> 25:26.191
If those bombs go off,
there'll be no ship to command.

25:26.191 --> 25:28.193
In any case, Mr. Atkins,

25:28.193 --> 25:30.695
you are fully competent
to handle her.

25:30.695 --> 25:32.197
Can we get started?

25:32.197 --> 25:33.198
Yes, ma'am.

25:33.198 --> 25:35.200
MacGyver,

25:35.200 --> 25:36.201
any objections?

25:36.201 --> 25:38.203
As long as you don't mind
taking orders

25:38.203 --> 25:39.704
instead of giving them...
Captain.

25:39.704 --> 25:41.706
I always bow to experts.

25:41.706 --> 25:43.208
And, um...

25:43.708 --> 25:45.710
I think we can find
a couple of neon lights

25:45.710 --> 25:46.711
in the lounge.

25:50.215 --> 25:53.218
I'd say we're in pretty
good hands, Mr. Atkins.

25:53.218 --> 25:55.220
Yes, sir.

26:16.241 --> 26:18.243
Guess we put
the ransom money

26:18.243 --> 26:21.246
in locker 324

26:21.246 --> 26:23.748
and then we pull the key.

26:23.748 --> 26:25.750
How's our Viking man
take delivery?

26:25.750 --> 26:28.753
He probably already made himself
a duplicate.

26:28.753 --> 26:30.755
All right, let's go.

26:37.762 --> 26:38.763
Hey.

26:38.763 --> 26:39.764
How about my carrying that?

26:39.764 --> 26:41.266
Why?

26:41.266 --> 26:43.268
I never lifted six
million bucks before.

26:43.268 --> 26:44.269
That'd be a cheap thrill.

26:44.269 --> 26:45.270
I'll carry it.

26:45.270 --> 26:46.771
You keep thinking
about it... out here.

26:47.272 --> 26:48.773
Aw, come on. Why?

26:48.773 --> 26:50.275
Why? Donahue
has a dozen cops

26:50.275 --> 26:51.776
covering this place.

26:51.776 --> 26:52.777
Donahue's inside.
Yeah?

26:52.777 --> 26:53.778
I'll be inside.

26:53.778 --> 26:56.281
We need one of our men
out here as a backup.

26:56.281 --> 26:57.782
And you're the lucky winner.

27:06.291 --> 27:07.292
Com check.

27:07.292 --> 27:10.295
Guess who?

27:11.796 --> 27:13.798
Heads up inside, Donahue.

27:13.798 --> 27:15.300
The money's coming in.

27:20.805 --> 27:22.807
(over P.A.):
This is the last call

27:22.807 --> 27:24.809
for interstate service
to San Francisco,

27:24.809 --> 27:26.811
Reno and Salt Lake City.

27:26.811 --> 27:28.813
Boarding at Gate Three.

27:28.813 --> 27:30.315
All right, I'm going
out to the car.

27:30.315 --> 27:32.317
I'll call in and check
on that M.O. follow-up.

27:32.317 --> 27:34.319
Right.

27:34.319 --> 27:35.820
Boy, there's less than
an hour to go.

27:35.820 --> 27:37.322
Something has to give.

27:37.322 --> 27:39.824
Yeah, I'm just afraid of
what that something is.

27:42.327 --> 27:44.329
All right,
let's stay alert, people.

27:50.335 --> 27:52.337
All right, Captain,
what we're gonna do here

27:52.337 --> 27:54.339
is make a little fair exchange.

27:54.339 --> 27:56.341
What do you say
we replace the vacuum

27:56.341 --> 27:58.343
with a little neon gas?

27:58.343 --> 27:59.344
But I got to admit

27:59.344 --> 28:01.346
I was a little surprised
to see you in charge

28:01.846 --> 28:02.847
of this whole ship.

28:02.847 --> 28:04.349
No more than I, MacGyver.

28:04.349 --> 28:06.851
Everything happened
kind of fast around here.

28:06.851 --> 28:10.355
Just give me directions.

28:10.855 --> 28:12.857
First step:

28:12.857 --> 28:14.859
take the sharpening stone
we got out of the bar

28:14.859 --> 28:17.862
and score a little piece of
the neon right at the very end.

28:20.365 --> 28:22.367
Here we go.

28:34.379 --> 28:37.382
Now, before you break the tube,

28:37.382 --> 28:39.384
make sure you got the cork handy
to plug it

28:39.384 --> 28:41.386
so the gas doesn't escape.

28:41.386 --> 28:43.388
One step at a time, right?

28:43.388 --> 28:44.389
Right.

28:44.389 --> 28:45.390
I'm almost through.

28:53.398 --> 28:55.900
All right, now break the tube
and plug it fast

28:55.900 --> 28:57.902
like I just did.

28:57.902 --> 28:59.404
Okay.

29:03.408 --> 29:04.909
Done.

29:04.909 --> 29:07.912
I don't believe it.

29:07.912 --> 29:10.415
Now, we're gonna work the tube
through the sealer.

29:10.415 --> 29:11.916
And when I pull the cork,

29:11.916 --> 29:13.418
hopefully I'll get
a momentary suction

29:13.418 --> 29:14.919
and that ought to give us
enough time

29:14.919 --> 29:16.921
to get the phosphorus
out of there.

29:17.422 --> 29:18.423
You with me, Captain?

29:18.923 --> 29:19.924
Under the circumstances,
MacGyver,

29:19.924 --> 29:21.426
why don't you call me Carole?

29:21.426 --> 29:24.929
Okay, Carole.

29:24.929 --> 29:27.432
Nice and slow.

29:29.434 --> 29:31.436
I'll go first.

29:43.948 --> 29:46.451
I'm working
the silicone sealer now.

29:46.451 --> 29:48.453
The glass tube is maintaining

29:48.453 --> 29:50.455
an air-tight penetration.

29:50.455 --> 29:51.956
Easy.

29:51.956 --> 29:53.958
Real easy.

29:53.958 --> 29:55.960
Just about through.

29:55.960 --> 29:57.462
This is the tricky part.

30:01.466 --> 30:03.468
Okay, I'm in.

30:05.470 --> 30:09.474
Now I can pop the cork
against the edge of the dish.

30:12.977 --> 30:13.978
Cork's out.

30:13.978 --> 30:15.980
Neon gas exchange
has given me the vacuum.

30:15.980 --> 30:18.483
It's working.

30:18.483 --> 30:20.985
It's extracting the phosphorus
from the dish.

30:22.987 --> 30:26.491
I have an environmental exchange
in the bomb cavity.

30:26.491 --> 30:27.992
The dish is empty.

30:30.495 --> 30:31.496
Removing the tube.

30:31.496 --> 30:32.997
Dumping the phosphorus.

30:33.998 --> 30:36.501
Okay, Carole, it's your turn.

30:36.501 --> 30:39.504
Now work the tube through
slowly.

30:39.504 --> 30:42.507
Keep moving it forward until you
get through the silicone sealer.

30:43.508 --> 30:46.010
I'm petrified, Mac.

30:46.010 --> 30:47.512
Hey, come on.

30:47.512 --> 30:48.513
Who's better than us?

30:48.513 --> 30:49.514
You can do it.

30:49.514 --> 30:53.017
I'm about to break through
the inner seal.

30:56.020 --> 30:57.522
Okay, Mac, I'm through.

30:57.522 --> 30:59.524
Good.

30:59.524 --> 31:02.527
Now go to the dish
and pop the cork.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.031
Got it.

31:07.031 --> 31:09.033
I'm in the dish.
It's sucking up

31:09.033 --> 31:10.535
the chemicals, Mac.

31:10.535 --> 31:12.036
I think it's gonna work.

31:12.036 --> 31:14.038
I'm gonna make it.
I know I am.

31:14.038 --> 31:15.540
Come on, come on.

31:18.042 --> 31:20.044
Almost there.

31:20.044 --> 31:22.547
Okay, got it.

31:22.547 --> 31:26.050
Well, that's one small step
for local mankind,

31:26.050 --> 31:28.052
and still a mile to go.

31:28.052 --> 31:31.055
That thermocouple's
German made, Boltex.

31:31.055 --> 31:34.058
If you guys want to check it out
in the bomber file,

31:34.058 --> 31:36.060
we'll get on to this blue
cauldron on top of the bomb.

31:36.060 --> 31:38.062
You've got less than
an hour now.

31:38.062 --> 31:39.564
Yeah, tell me about it.

31:39.564 --> 31:42.567
You guys any closer
to this Viking?

31:42.567 --> 31:44.068
Not an inch.

31:44.068 --> 31:46.571
(computer beeping)

31:46.571 --> 31:47.572
Stay with that.

31:49.073 --> 31:51.075
(distorted voice):
Mr. Thornton, this is Viking.

31:51.075 --> 31:54.078
Despite your efforts to ensnare
me at the bus station,

31:54.078 --> 31:55.079
I have the money.

31:55.079 --> 31:57.081
But you have dealt in bad faith,

31:57.081 --> 31:58.583
so I have decided
not to give you

31:58.583 --> 32:00.084
the bomb-disarming instructions.

32:00.084 --> 32:02.587
Goodbye, Mr. Thornton.

32:03.588 --> 32:04.589
That's it.

32:08.593 --> 32:11.095
Control to field operations.
Come in.

32:11.095 --> 32:13.598
Control, this is Carlyle.
Go ahead.

32:13.598 --> 32:16.601
But we haven't taken
our eyes off it.

32:16.601 --> 32:18.603
Harrison, get this place
locked down.

32:18.603 --> 32:20.605
There's a rumor
the six million's already gone.

32:20.605 --> 32:21.606
I'm on it.

32:23.107 --> 32:25.610
What is it?
Thornton says that
Viking's got the money.

32:27.111 --> 32:29.113
(dog barks)

32:34.118 --> 32:35.620
The money's gone.

32:49.133 --> 32:50.635
(laughs):
He went in through here.

32:50.635 --> 32:53.638
There's a utility room in the
back of the station, you know?

32:53.638 --> 32:55.139
So nobody saw him, huh?

32:55.139 --> 32:58.142
No, no, no, he had this thing
set up from square one.

32:58.142 --> 33:00.645
Got a false back, hidden panel.

33:00.645 --> 33:03.147
It was a nice,
neat job, huh?

33:03.147 --> 33:05.149
There's a false
back on the locker.

33:05.149 --> 33:07.151
Goes into the
back room.

33:07.151 --> 33:08.653
Viking must've
had the money

33:08.653 --> 33:10.655
two minutes after
we put it in there.

33:10.655 --> 33:13.658
He is smart.
He's too damn smart.

33:13.658 --> 33:14.659
(sighs)

33:14.659 --> 33:18.663
Mac... I got some bad news.

33:18.663 --> 33:20.665
Real bad.

33:20.665 --> 33:23.668
Viking somehow outmaneuvered us
with the ransom.

33:24.168 --> 33:27.171
He got it out of the locker
in the bus station.

33:27.171 --> 33:29.674
We had it staked out,
but we didn't get him.

33:29.674 --> 33:33.177
He just called...
gloating about it,

33:33.177 --> 33:35.179
but worse than that,

33:35.179 --> 33:39.183
he says that we broke faith
by trying to trap him,

33:39.183 --> 33:41.686
so now he's really going
to punish us.

33:41.686 --> 33:44.188
He's got the $6 six million,

33:44.188 --> 33:48.192
but he's not going to tell us
how to deactivate the bombs.

33:48.192 --> 33:50.695
He's going to let everybody
on that ship die.

33:50.695 --> 33:54.699
So, the bottom line, Mac...

33:54.699 --> 33:56.200
it's up to you now.

34:17.722 --> 34:22.726
Okay, here's where we find out
just how good Viking is.

34:24.228 --> 34:26.230
This pipework
in that blue cauldron

34:26.230 --> 34:28.232
looked like our last trigger.

34:28.232 --> 34:30.234
Can I tell you I haven't got
the smallest hint

34:30.234 --> 34:31.235
of what I'm looking at here?

34:31.235 --> 34:32.737
Well, you're doing just great.

34:32.737 --> 34:35.739
And you're not alone.

34:39.243 --> 34:41.245
All right now, I'm touching

34:41.746 --> 34:44.248
the right-hand connection
at the circuit boards.

34:44.248 --> 34:46.250
Read you.

34:47.251 --> 34:48.753
Mac, freeze it!

34:48.753 --> 34:50.254
What?

34:50.254 --> 34:51.255
THORNTON:
The computer says

34:51.255 --> 34:53.757
the Ling Chow bomber used
an unstable electrolyte

34:53.757 --> 34:55.760
fluid trigger
on two sabotage attempts

34:55.760 --> 34:58.262
in Cam Ranh Bay in 1973.

34:58.262 --> 34:59.263
What does that mean?

34:59.263 --> 35:01.265
The fluid carries a current.

35:01.265 --> 35:03.267
Now our problem is

35:03.267 --> 35:04.769
to neutralize it.

35:04.769 --> 35:06.771
Donahue?

35:09.774 --> 35:11.275
No, this doesn't
ring any bells.

35:11.275 --> 35:13.778
(sighs):
Are you sure?

35:13.778 --> 35:15.780
You commanded
the lead sabotage control group

35:16.280 --> 35:17.782
in Cam Ranh Bay
'71 to '73.

35:17.782 --> 35:20.785
Well, yeah, but
I didn't ride 'em
all personally.

35:20.785 --> 35:22.787
This one...

35:22.787 --> 35:26.290
All right, Mac,
hold on a second.

35:26.290 --> 35:27.792
This could be an acid mixture.

35:27.792 --> 35:29.794
MacGYVER:
Yeah, that's what I figured.

35:29.794 --> 35:30.795
Breach the piping circuit,

35:30.795 --> 35:32.296
and you release the acid.

35:32.797 --> 35:35.800
And we'd release the acid
into this lateral wiring.

35:35.800 --> 35:36.801
MacGYVER:
Yeah.

35:36.801 --> 35:38.302
Probably create a short.

35:38.302 --> 35:39.804
I understand.

35:39.804 --> 35:41.806
All right, Carole,
I've got an idea here,

35:41.806 --> 35:44.308
but we're going to need
some things for both of us.

35:44.809 --> 35:45.810
Name them.

35:45.810 --> 35:48.312
Uh, let's see, a pastry tube,

35:48.813 --> 35:50.815
a container
of liquid oven cleaner

35:51.315 --> 35:52.817
and a pint of milk, please.

35:52.817 --> 35:54.318
CAROLE:
Milk?

35:54.318 --> 35:56.320
Yeah, low fat, if you got it.

35:56.320 --> 35:57.321
CAROLE:
Mr. Atkins?

35:57.321 --> 35:58.322
Ma'am?

35:58.322 --> 35:59.824
CAROLE:
You heard Mr. MacGyver.

35:59.824 --> 36:03.327
Pastry tubes, oven cleaner,
low fat milk.

36:03.828 --> 36:04.328
CAROLE:
Move.

36:04.829 --> 36:05.329
On the double.

36:05.830 --> 36:06.831
Aye, aye, Captain.

36:06.831 --> 36:08.332
THORNTON:
MacGyver, milk?

36:08.332 --> 36:11.335
Add a strong alkaline base
and an organic neutral...

36:11.335 --> 36:13.838
if it's an acid,
we're in business.

36:13.838 --> 36:15.339
What if you're wrong?

36:15.339 --> 36:18.342
Well, then it's back
to the old drawing board.

36:22.847 --> 36:23.848
MacGYVER:
All right, Carole,

36:23.848 --> 36:25.349
this is the best
we have to work with.

36:25.349 --> 36:27.351
Let's just think of it
as one giant dose

36:27.351 --> 36:29.854
of industrial-strength antacid.

36:29.854 --> 36:32.356
First the milk.

36:32.356 --> 36:33.858
About three-quarters
full should do it.

36:33.858 --> 36:35.359
You got that?

36:37.361 --> 36:38.863
Yeah, got it.

36:38.863 --> 36:42.867
MacGYVER:
Now I'm gonna top it off
with the oven cleaner.

36:42.867 --> 36:44.368
You do the same.

36:44.368 --> 36:46.871
And mix it up real good.

36:46.871 --> 36:48.372
Okay, it's mixed.

36:48.873 --> 36:50.875
Cap's going on.

36:51.375 --> 36:53.377
Ready on this end, Mac.

36:53.377 --> 36:55.379
All right, time check.

36:55.379 --> 36:57.882
19 minutes and 41 seconds,

36:57.882 --> 36:59.884
and counting.

36:59.884 --> 37:02.386
Now I'm gonna pry up
the lead glass stopper seal

37:02.386 --> 37:05.389
on top of the number one
cylinder, upper right quadrant.

37:05.389 --> 37:06.390
Right.

37:13.397 --> 37:15.900
Okay, Carole,
this is probably acid,

37:16.400 --> 37:19.403
so just wait until I get
the stopper seals off.

37:21.906 --> 37:23.908
There's the first one.

37:23.908 --> 37:27.411
It's acid, all right.
I can smell it.

37:27.411 --> 37:30.414
Now... number two.

37:32.416 --> 37:34.919
Okay, Carole, go ahead

37:34.919 --> 37:36.921
and remove your
number one stopper seal.

37:38.422 --> 37:41.425
CAROLE:
Mac, is anything happening
with your acid level?

37:41.425 --> 37:44.428
It seems to be okay.

37:44.428 --> 37:46.430
CAROLE:
I've removed number two.
You done yet?

37:46.430 --> 37:47.932
MacGYVER:
Just about...

37:47.932 --> 37:48.933
got it.

37:54.438 --> 37:56.941
All right, Carole,
I'm putting the first dose

37:56.941 --> 38:02.446
of neutralizer into the acid
in cylinder number one.

38:03.948 --> 38:05.449
Cylinder two.

38:09.453 --> 38:10.955
There's a reaction starting.

38:12.456 --> 38:15.459
All right, all four are treated.

38:15.459 --> 38:16.961
How you doing?

38:16.961 --> 38:18.963
Okay.

38:18.963 --> 38:23.968
I am now removing
the final stopper seal.

38:30.474 --> 38:32.977
Stopper seal's off.

38:32.977 --> 38:35.479
MacGYVER:
Good job, Captain.

38:35.479 --> 38:37.481
Now inject our milk
and oven cleaner mixture

38:37.481 --> 38:38.482
into the acid.

38:38.983 --> 38:40.484
Roger.

38:40.484 --> 38:41.986
Am doing.

38:47.992 --> 38:50.494
I have reactions.

38:50.494 --> 38:53.998
CAROLE:
All four cylinders are cloudy.

38:53.998 --> 38:57.001
(sighs)

39:03.007 --> 39:05.009
MacGYVER:
Yeah, mine, too.

39:05.009 --> 39:06.510
Now we wait,

39:06.510 --> 39:08.012
keep our thumbs crossed.

39:08.012 --> 39:10.014
Bridge, this is the captain.

39:10.014 --> 39:12.016
I want the compartment
doors dog shut

39:12.016 --> 39:13.517
on myself and Mr. MacGyver.

39:13.517 --> 39:15.019
Have Engineering brace them.

39:15.019 --> 39:17.021
If the bombs blow,

39:17.021 --> 39:19.523
hopefully we'll
confine the explosion.

39:19.523 --> 39:20.524
Ma'am...

39:20.524 --> 39:21.525
Mr. Atkins,

39:21.525 --> 39:23.527
this is no time
for conversation.

39:23.527 --> 39:24.528
Will do, Captain.

39:24.528 --> 39:26.030
What do you think, Donahue?

39:26.030 --> 39:28.032
Seems like we might be
on the right track.

39:28.032 --> 39:29.033
Well, I am impressed.

39:29.033 --> 39:30.534
You just may have licked it.

39:30.534 --> 39:32.036
Didn't your boys
do a post mortem

39:32.036 --> 39:34.538
on this acid trigger in 'Nam?

39:34.538 --> 39:37.541
Well, sure we did, but there
wasn't much left after she blew.

39:37.541 --> 39:39.043
We ended up
with a lot of guesswork.

39:39.043 --> 39:40.544
That's too bad.

39:40.544 --> 39:42.046
Sure like to know if I'm right.

39:42.046 --> 39:45.049
Well, we'll know
in about five minutes.

39:45.049 --> 39:46.550
Hey, Pete,

39:46.550 --> 39:49.053
don't forget, you and I have
got a little golf match

39:49.053 --> 39:50.554
as soon as this job is over.

39:50.554 --> 39:52.056
Yeah, right.

39:52.056 --> 39:55.059
And I'm gonna spot you
a stroke a hole, buddy.

39:55.059 --> 39:57.561
I'm gonna check in
with H.Q.

39:58.062 --> 39:59.063
Keep monitoring.

39:59.063 --> 40:02.066
Yeah, I will.

40:02.066 --> 40:07.071
(indistinct conversations)

40:07.071 --> 40:09.573
Mac? What's up?

40:09.573 --> 40:11.075
We clear?

40:11.075 --> 40:12.576
Yeah, we're on
a separate channel.

40:12.576 --> 40:14.578
Come on, you never
played a round of golf

40:14.578 --> 40:17.081
in your entire misspent life.
What's up?

40:17.081 --> 40:18.582
Listen, I got a notion here.

40:19.083 --> 40:23.087
Can you check out that incident
at Cam Ranh Bay in '73?

40:23.587 --> 40:26.090
Yeah, sure I can.
What is it?

40:26.090 --> 40:29.093
Well, this is a great piece
of booby-trap rigging,

40:29.093 --> 40:30.594
and I mean good.

40:30.594 --> 40:34.598
And anything this fine usually
has a personal signature to it.

40:34.598 --> 40:37.101
It's not technology, it's art.

40:37.601 --> 40:38.602
Art?

40:38.602 --> 40:40.604
MacGyver, it's a damn bomb.

40:40.604 --> 40:43.107
You just lack artistic taste.

40:43.107 --> 40:45.609
Just cross check them for me,
will you, Pete?

40:45.609 --> 40:48.612
Phosphorus, thermocouple,
acid trigger.

40:48.612 --> 40:50.614
Who ran into them in 'Nam?

40:50.614 --> 40:53.117
Yeah, it could be anybody
on a decon team.

40:53.117 --> 40:55.119
Yeah, but who was
on each of these?

40:55.119 --> 40:56.620
All of them.

40:56.620 --> 41:00.124
You might be able to narrow it
down to a couple of names.

41:00.124 --> 41:01.125
Maybe just one.

41:01.125 --> 41:02.126
Viking.

41:02.126 --> 41:05.129
Okay, Mac, I'm on it.

41:07.631 --> 41:08.632
MacGyver?

41:08.632 --> 41:09.633
Yeah?

41:09.633 --> 41:10.634
I can see

41:10.634 --> 41:12.136
a definite change in the fluid.

41:12.136 --> 41:13.637
Is that what we want?

41:14.638 --> 41:16.140
Absolutely.

41:16.140 --> 41:18.642
It's neutralizing.

41:25.149 --> 41:27.151
It's clear.

41:27.151 --> 41:28.652
Okay.

41:28.652 --> 41:33.157
MacGYVER:
Okay, everybody,
last step coming up, stand by.

41:33.157 --> 41:36.160
I'm draining it now.

42:01.685 --> 42:04.688
(bomb powers down)

42:06.690 --> 42:09.193
CAROLE:
Mac, everything stopped.

42:09.193 --> 42:11.195
Okay.

42:11.195 --> 42:12.696
We did it.

42:12.696 --> 42:16.700
(cheering, laughing)

42:23.207 --> 42:25.209
MacGyver nailed that sucker.

42:25.209 --> 42:26.210
Congratulations.

42:26.210 --> 42:27.711
He sure did.

42:27.711 --> 42:30.214
Uh, listen, I gotta
notify my people.

42:30.214 --> 42:31.715
Stay on top of this, will you?

42:31.715 --> 42:33.217
You got it.

42:39.723 --> 42:40.724
Mac?

42:40.724 --> 42:42.226
What is it, Pete?

42:42.226 --> 42:43.227
We're back on
the separate channel.

42:43.227 --> 42:45.729
The computer ran your pattern.

42:45.729 --> 42:47.231
Came up with one name.

42:47.231 --> 42:48.732
Want a guess?

42:48.732 --> 42:49.733
Try me.

42:50.234 --> 42:52.736
Viking had to be familiar with
each of these trigger-traps.

42:52.736 --> 42:55.739
Especially the acid...
in Cam Ranh Bay.

42:55.739 --> 42:59.743
Is that where
Donahue lost his leg?

42:59.743 --> 43:01.245
Yeah.

43:01.245 --> 43:04.248
If you knew, why did you bother
with the computer check?

43:04.248 --> 43:05.749
Well, it gave us proof.

43:05.749 --> 43:07.251
All I had was a hunch.

43:07.251 --> 43:10.254
Well, it nails Donahue.

43:10.254 --> 43:13.757
(mechanism humming)

43:15.259 --> 43:17.261
(beeping)

43:17.261 --> 43:19.763
Pete, back on the com line.

43:19.763 --> 43:20.764
Right.

43:43.787 --> 43:46.290
Carole, get the panel off now.

43:46.290 --> 43:48.792
We have to get
to the bottom of the bomb.

43:48.792 --> 43:50.794
It's reactivated.

43:52.796 --> 43:53.797
CAROLE:
Okay, Mac,

43:53.797 --> 43:55.299
I see what looks like two fuses.

43:55.299 --> 43:57.301
Uh, yellow and blue.

43:57.301 --> 44:00.804
Yeah, one cuts the circuit
and one fires it.

44:00.804 --> 44:01.805
Which?

44:01.805 --> 44:02.806
Donahue?

44:02.806 --> 44:03.807
Right here.

44:03.807 --> 44:04.308
I'm stuck.

44:04.308 --> 44:05.809
I got less than a minute.

44:05.809 --> 44:06.810
I need some help.

44:06.810 --> 44:08.312
We've got all the pieces

44:08.312 --> 44:09.813
of Viking's signature
right here in the bomb.

44:09.813 --> 44:11.815
Stop it and we stop him.

44:11.815 --> 44:13.317
Come on.

44:13.317 --> 44:15.319
I've never made this kind
of call without Charlie.

44:15.319 --> 44:16.820
We'd team it, two heads.

44:17.321 --> 44:18.322
Both experts.

44:18.322 --> 44:19.823
Help me, Donahue.

44:19.823 --> 44:21.825
Help me and we'll stop this guy.

44:21.825 --> 44:22.826
What's your head

44:23.327 --> 44:24.328
and your gut say?

44:24.328 --> 44:25.329
Yellow or blue?

44:25.329 --> 44:27.331
Come on, Donahue.
You've been there.

44:27.331 --> 44:28.332
You can make
a judgment call.

44:28.332 --> 44:30.834
There are 1,100 people
aboard this ship.

44:33.337 --> 44:35.339
Blue.

44:37.341 --> 44:38.342
MacGYVER:
Carole, hold it.

44:38.342 --> 44:39.843
In my tracks, Captain.

44:39.843 --> 44:41.845
I go first. Just in case.

44:41.845 --> 44:43.347
Pull the blue.

44:43.347 --> 44:44.848
Thanks a lot, Donahue.

44:44.848 --> 44:46.850
I'm pulling the yellow.

44:47.851 --> 44:48.852
No!

44:50.854 --> 44:51.855
(powers down)

44:51.855 --> 44:52.856
Yellow, Carole,

44:52.856 --> 44:53.857
yank it.

44:55.359 --> 44:58.862
(powers down)

45:03.867 --> 45:05.369
Viking.

45:09.373 --> 45:09.873
Carole?

45:09.873 --> 45:10.874
How you doing?

45:10.874 --> 45:12.376
(chuckles)

45:12.376 --> 45:15.379
I think I'll live.

45:15.379 --> 45:17.381
(sighs)

45:17.381 --> 45:18.882
Me, too.

45:24.388 --> 45:26.390
Get him out
of my sight.

45:34.898 --> 45:36.900
Your chopper will
be here in an hour.

45:36.900 --> 45:38.402
Do you have to go?

45:38.402 --> 45:40.904
Well...

45:40.904 --> 45:42.406
I can recommend the cruise.

45:42.406 --> 45:45.409
Gourmet cuisine,
sports and games.

45:45.409 --> 45:46.410
Dancing every night.

45:46.410 --> 45:48.412
It's a great place
to relax,

45:48.412 --> 45:50.914
if you've been under stress.

45:50.914 --> 45:54.418
Well...

45:54.918 --> 45:58.422
do I get to sit at
the captain's table?

46:10.434 --> 46:16.940
(theme music plays)

46:17.305 --> 46:23.167
