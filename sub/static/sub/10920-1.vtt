And proclaim the good news

00:23.857 --> 00:26.850
Let us pray now for three members
of our Order...

00:27.152 --> 00:31.317
who leave us this day to carry on
our work beyond these walls.

00:31.615 --> 00:34.358
We ask you, oh Lord,
to watch over Sister Michelle...

00:34.660 --> 00:37.994
and those two of Your servants
whom she has chosen to accompany her.

00:40.749 --> 00:44.834
- We ask you to guard over Sister Barbara.
- Thank you.

00:45.128 --> 00:48.417
Look with favor, too,
upon Sister Irene.

00:48.715 --> 00:51.924
May You bless their efforts
and grant them the strength and patience...

00:52.219 --> 00:54.051
To carry out Your will.

00:54.346 --> 00:57.510
And may they find,
through Your divine mission and sacrifice.

Thank you, sir. You've been very helpful.
But I think we can manage now.

- I'm sorry, but the office is closed.
- But we have to see the doctor.

08:20.750 --> 08:24.289
Hey, Doc? Doc? You left us hangin'
in the middle of our thing, man.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.670
Fake it for about 32 bars,
I'll be right back.

08:26.965 --> 08:30.424
Okay.
You're the doctor?

- Well...

08:34.972 --> 08:38.967
man doesn't live by bread alone,
especially the kind of bread you make in a free clinic.

08:39.269 --> 08:41.932
John Carpenter, M.D.
Just like the sign says.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.483
- Which one of you is in trouble?
- I beg your pardon?

08:47.777 --> 08:51.017
Look, I know the whole story.
You don't want to go to your family doctor uptown...

08:51.114 --> 08:54.034
so you figure you'll come here
and get everything straightened out, right?

08:54.284 --> 08:56.124
We were sent here.
You came to the wrong place.

08:56.286 --> 09:00.280
I won't do any more for you than I would
any other kid who finds herself in the same fix.

09:00.582 --> 09:03.620
Whichever one of you
is the lucky girl, follow me.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.833
I'll give you
some vitamin pills and a diet sheet.

09:08.131 --> 09:11.715
Just try not to gain too much weight,
especially in the first three months.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.842
All three of you?

09:15.638 --> 09:19.177
Uh, just out of curiosity,
was it the same guy?

09:19.476 --> 09:23.060
Doctor, we were sent here
by the Catholic Action Committee.

09:23.354 --> 09:25.846
Don't try to con me, honey.
We were given to understand...

09:26.149 --> 09:27.890
That you were desperately
in need of nurses.

09:28.193 --> 09:30.254
That's my problem.
It's got nothing to do with you chicks.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.520
We are the nurses they sent.

09:34.949 --> 09:38.613
I am a psychiatric social worker
with a degree in speech therapy.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.655
Sis... Barbara is
a laboratory technician.

09:41.956 --> 09:45.199
Irene is a R.N.
With a degree in public health.

09:46.336 --> 09:49.170
Great. Just great.

09:50.965 --> 09:54.333
I ask for three hard-nosed nurses
and they send me Park Avenue debutantes.

09:54.636 --> 09:58.175
Which end of Park Avenue do
you figure I'm from, Doctor?

09:58.473 --> 10:02.217
The last three nurses who worked here couldn't take it.
Two of them got raped.

10:02.519 --> 10:06.934
- One even against her will.
- We are very hard-nosed.

10:09.150 --> 10:11.062
Cute.
But not hard enough.

10:11.361 --> 10:13.899
You'll never make it
in this neighborhood, ladies. Never.

10:14.197 --> 10:17.037
Well, Doctor, you don't exactly sound
as if you were born and bred here.

10:17.325 --> 10:21.444
- I'm from Tennessee.
- Obviously not on a diplomatic mission.

10:21.746 --> 10:26.036
Honey, diplomacy starts and ends here
at the point of a switchblade.

10:26.334 --> 10:31.875
- Why don't you go back uptown?
- We are here and we are going to stay here for two months...

10:32.173 --> 10:34.005
which is the length
of our assignment.

10:36.970 --> 10:40.213
Okay. Okay.

10:42.183 --> 10:45.893
- Have you got a place to stay?
- We understand Father Gibbons...

10:46.187 --> 10:49.351
the local parish...
has arranged for an apartment.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.686
Okay. We start work
at 8:00 sharp.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.068
See you then, all right?

10:54.362 --> 10:56.604
All right.

11:01.369 --> 11:04.157
Oh, ladies, what are your names?

11:04.455 --> 11:07.368
Oh, I'm Michelle.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.705
This is Irene and Barbara.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.166
Last names?
Oh.

11:15.175 --> 11:18.464
- You do have last names, don't you?
- Oh, yes.

11:18.761 --> 11:21.720
- It's Gallagher.
- Gallagher.

11:22.015 --> 11:25.508

and what happens happens, huh?

11:30.356 --> 11:32.439
Yeah. Barbara?

11:32.734 --> 11:35.693
Bennett.

11:35.987 --> 11:37.944
Irene?
Hawkins.

11:40.283 --> 11:42.946
Okay, ladies, that will be all.
See you tomorrow morning.

11:43.244 --> 11:45.076
Good-bye.

11:48.791 --> 11:51.408
Weirdos, man. Weirdos.

11:51.753 --> 11:54.416
- Just get out of our way.
- Washington Street is our turf, see?

11:54.714 --> 11:58.583
We have no designs on
anything on Washington Street.

11:58.885 --> 12:02.253
Now, if you'll excuse us.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.405
Saints preserve us,
it's a rumble.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.110
There we are.

12:33.086 --> 12:36.625
You get out of here, all of ya!
I'll call the precinct.

12:36.923 --> 12:39.085
Good afternoon.

12:39.384 --> 12:43.253
Talk about the wages of sin.
Will you look at the duds on them.

12:43.554 --> 12:46.922
Oh, we're not what
you think we are.

12:47.225 --> 12:51.811
Sure, and they're calling themselves "massosies" now.
I read it in the Enquirer:

12:52.105 --> 12:55.564
We don't want any monkey business around here,
I'm warning ya.

12:55.858 --> 12:59.522
- We have friends at the precinct.
- We want to be friends too.

12:59.821 --> 13:03.485
Call Father Gibbons.
He'll want to know what's coming into his parish now.

13:08.329 --> 13:10.787
And tell him one of'em's
black as the ace of spades.

13:11.082 --> 13:13.369
Ooh-ooh!

13:18.881 --> 13:20.668
I think our neighbors
are Catholic.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.209
Yes. It's too bad
they're not Christian.

13:44.615 --> 13:49.610
- What a mess.
- What a rotten mess.

13:54.375 --> 13:57.834
Well, furniture would help.

14:00.131 --> 14:04.250
We'll check that out with Father Gibbons
when we go to evening prayers.

14:04.552 --> 14:08.922
In the meantime,
let's get this place next to godliness.

14:25.823 --> 14:29.487
It's only 7:00.
This church keeps banker's hours.

14:37.085 --> 14:40.374
All right.

14:40.671 --> 14:43.914
All right, I'm coming.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.797
I'm coming!

14:52.100 --> 14:53.932
You don't have
to knock the door down.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.395
Father Gibbons?

15:02.693 --> 15:05.356
Come in.
Come in.

15:10.034 --> 15:12.196
Well, what is it?
An accident?

15:12.495 --> 15:16.330
I don't fancy giving a conditional absolution
on a long ride in an ambulance...

15:16.624 --> 15:19.958
And having to pay my own way
back from the hospital in a taxi.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.745
It's nothing like that, Father.
What then?

15:23.047 --> 15:26.006
- We wanted to come into the church to pray.
- Oh.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.212
So it's you?

15:28.511 --> 15:31.845
The secret agents from
the Little Sisters of Mary.

15:32.140 --> 15:35.349
Well, uh, in a manner
of speaking, yes.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.350
You might say
we're on a secret mission.

15:37.645 --> 15:42.606
I don't like underground nuns
who wear bobbed hair and silk stockings.

15:42.900 --> 15:45.358
Oh, but they're nylon, Father.

15:45.653 --> 15:47.986
Thank you.

Father, we're here to help.

15:51.367 --> 15:54.280
For 43 years,
I've managed without you.

15:54.579 --> 15:57.947
The bishop told me to let you
come into the parish and find a place for you to live.

15:58.249 --> 16:00.115
And don't expect
anything else from me.

16:00.418 --> 16:02.284
Well, we'd like to pray.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.588
Very well.

16:12.513 --> 16:15.802
I keep the doors locked.
I'm not about to roll aut the red carpet...

16:16.100 --> 16:19.218
for every thief in the neighborhood to come in
and steal our candlesticks...

16:19.520 --> 16:21.978
and anything else
you can't nail down.

16:22.273 --> 16:26.768
They've already made off with
one of the Stations of the Cross.

16:27.069 --> 16:30.062
Now, when you've finished,
you'll find your own way out.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.356
Thank you, Father.
- Father Gibbons?

16:35.036 --> 16:37.995
May I suggest you put away
the candlesticks...

16:38.289 --> 16:42.829
unlock the doors and make it easier for those
who wish to pray to our Lord?

16:43.127 --> 16:48.748
Flapper skirts on a bride of Christ.
I've been ordered by the bishop to countenance.

16:49.050 --> 16:52.259
But I warn you, Sister,
I'll have none of your arrogant lip.

17:07.818 --> 17:09.605
You think it's twins?

17:09.904 --> 17:13.318
I think it's the Green Bay Packers,
that's what I think it is.

17:15.326 --> 17:17.909
Good morning.
Oh, good morning, ladies.

17:19.704 --> 17:21.696
Back this way, please.

17:21.999 --> 17:24.833
Where's Miss Teenage America?
She gone back to mother already?

17:25.127 --> 17:28.119
The Catholic Action Committee
is sending us some secondhand furniture.

17:28.422 --> 17:31.335
Barbara's gone to wait for it.
She'll be here just as soon as she can.

17:31.634 --> 17:34.342
- It'll be a relief to sleep in a bed again.
- Hmm?

17:34.637 --> 17:37.220
Yeah. You'll take care
of the house calls.

17:37.515 --> 17:40.077
- You'll work with me here in the office all right?
- Yes, Doctor.

17:40.101 --> 17:42.013
Now, about the house calls...

17:42.311 --> 17:45.395
- You probably won't be able to make 'em all in one day.
- I'll make them.

17:47.692 --> 17:51.060
I've shorted you on drugs.
I don't want you getting rolled for narcotics.

17:51.362 --> 17:53.900
Doctor, I was born in a place like this.
I know where it's at.

17:54.198 --> 17:56.030
Fine. Just don't
push your luck, huh?

17:56.325 --> 17:58.567
I got a patient for you.

18:02.081 --> 18:05.290
What's she doing here?
She sure doesn't act like she enjoys it.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.292
She knows it's her duty.

18:07.587 --> 18:10.580
Forcing yourself to like misery?
That's her bag, huh?

18:10.881 --> 18:13.589
A girl like that should get married
and raise a whole bunch of kids.

18:13.884 --> 18:16.342
Turn her hang-ups into
something worthwhile.

18:16.637 --> 18:19.675
In fact, uh, I'd prescribe
that for all three of you.

18:19.974 --> 18:23.308
You said you had a patient.
In my office.

18:25.062 --> 18:27.930
Don't you run off.
I'll be right with you.

18:28.232 --> 18:32.226
Mr. Hernandez, Julio,
this is Miss Gallagher.

18:32.528 --> 18:34.520
How do you do?
Hello.

18:34.822 --> 18:36.609
Stand up.

18:36.907 --> 18:40.696
Miss Gallagher's a speech therapist.
I want her to talk to Julio.

18:40.995 --> 18:44.033
What good is to talk?
He no talk back.

18:45.499 --> 18:49.334
- Julio.
- What's the matter with you?

18:56.260 --> 18:59.970
He's got trouble, miss.
Trouble in school, trouble on the streets...

19:00.264 --> 19:02.301
all because he don't talk good.

19:02.600 --> 19:05.843
Do they have a remedial
speech program at the school?

19:06.145 --> 19:09.138
What school?
He comes from the school with the high wall...

19:09.440 --> 19:13.810
- bars on the window, that kind of school.
- I n-n-no g-g-go back.

19:14.111 --> 19:16.819
You shut up!
You don't talk until you talk good.

19:17.114 --> 19:21.324
- You just listen!
- Julio.

19:21.619 --> 19:23.611
Maybe I can help you.

19:23.913 --> 19:26.075
Maybe we can correct
your speech problem.

19:29.335 --> 19:31.327
W-W-Why...

19:31.629 --> 19:34.793
do I...

19:35.091 --> 19:36.798
do-do it?

19:37.093 --> 19:39.210
T-T-Tell me.

19:41.055 --> 19:43.342
He talk like a dummy,
but he ain't no dummy.

19:43.641 --> 19:45.598
Mr. Hernandez, we're not
gonna get anyplace...

19:45.893 --> 19:48.510
Until you let Julio speak for himself.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.988
Julio.

20:01.325 --> 20:05.114
- That's sharp.
- It feels...

20:06.372 --> 20:08.785
good.

20:09.083 --> 20:11.871
I feel good.

20:15.965 --> 20:18.673
I... talk... better.

20:18.968 --> 20:21.335
Julio, put it down.

20:23.097 --> 20:26.056
You heard the lady.
Drop it or I'll smash your teeth in.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.592
Julio, please,

20:31.689 --> 20:33.726
For me.

20:37.945 --> 20:40.232
You see, he knows
what's good for him.

20:40.531 --> 20:45.777
Julio, I'd like to see you tomorrow afternoon at 4:00.
All right?

20:47.121 --> 20:50.410
Al-All... r-r-right.

20:50.708 --> 20:53.701
- I'll bring him.
- Alone, doctor Carpenter.

20:54.003 --> 20:55.960
Alone, Mr. Hernandez.

21:02.511 --> 21:04.423
Gracias.

21:10.478 --> 21:12.390
It gets a little
messy down here.

21:13.773 --> 21:16.265
I thought you handled that
very well, Miss Gallagher.

21:16.567 --> 21:19.776
Well, you certainly have
a way with a compliment, doctor.

21:20.070 --> 21:23.108
It's Southern charm, we call it.

21:38.047 --> 21:40.380
He seems to be
taking it very well.

21:40.674 --> 21:44.509
Yeah. Well, you don't feel very much
when you're on the stuff.

21:46.597 --> 21:49.681
- "H."
- Oh.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.847
- Hello?
- Hi. Listen, the furniture came...

21:58.150 --> 22:00.062
but the men just
dumped it on the sidewalk...

22:00.361 --> 22:02.273
and drove off before
I could stop them.

22:02.571 --> 22:05.484
Just a minute.
It's Barbara.

22:05.783 --> 22:09.823
The furniture arrived and she needs some help
getting it into the apartment.

22:10.120 --> 22:13.784
Look, I got patients stacked up out there like jet planes
over International Airport.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.416
So I can tell Barbara what
to do with her furniture.

22:16.710 --> 22:20.920
Dr. Carpenter suggests that you rely
on your own resources to solve this problem.

22:47.575 --> 22:50.409
Ay, mama!

23:18.105 --> 23:20.017
Lily.

23:45.883 --> 23:49.672
The hussy.
Massosie.

23:49.970 --> 23:52.633
I have to get this furniture
moved downstairs...

23:52.932 --> 23:56.175
And I need a man.

24:03.442 --> 24:06.401
Oh, good.

24:17.706 --> 24:22.121
All I have is 40 dollars. But I'll get more.
I'll get the other 20.

24:22.419 --> 24:25.457
Now, you borrowed 50, you owe 60,
you pay back 40.

24:25.756 --> 24:28.123
Now you owe 30.

24:28.425 --> 24:30.838
I'll pay it back.
Friday, for sure.

24:31.136 --> 24:34.095
I'm not worried. I got good collateral...
your arms, your legs...

24:34.390 --> 24:36.723
your wife and your kids.

24:45.025 --> 24:47.608
It's very heavy.

24:47.903 --> 24:49.940
You think we're
some kind of faggots?

24:50.239 --> 24:53.528
I beg your pardon?

24:59.206 --> 25:02.324
Everybody says it's
how she was born deaf.

25:13.137 --> 25:16.346
Well, there's no sign of any physical damage.
She doesn't respond.

25:16.640 --> 25:19.007
Has she ever tried to speak?

25:19.309 --> 25:24.179
- I heard her whistle once.
- People learn to whistle by imitating the sound.

25:24.481 --> 25:28.191
- But you got to be able to hear to do that.
- Maybe she can hear.

25:28.485 --> 25:32.695
- Is Amanda your daughter?
- My sister's kid.

25:32.990 --> 25:35.323
She just come and dumped her on me
a couple of years ago.

25:35.617 --> 25:38.701
She-She never wanted the kid
in the first place.

25:38.996 --> 25:42.285
- I think she's autistic.
- Artistic?

25:42.583 --> 25:44.825
Nah. She don't even
lift up a crayon.

25:45.127 --> 25:46.914
No. Autistic.

25:47.212 --> 25:49.750
Sometimes, when a child's
rejected very early in life...

25:50.049 --> 25:53.292
they crawl inside themselves
and shut out the whole world...

25:53.594 --> 25:56.962
as if they're trying to punish the rest of us
along with themselves.

25:59.516 --> 26:02.634
Amanda?

26:04.480 --> 26:07.439
Hey. Hey.

26:07.733 --> 26:11.352
Hey, baby, look at me.
Come on, come on, look at me.

26:11.653 --> 26:14.066
You see how she resists
any kind of contact.

26:14.364 --> 26:16.401
It's typical of
autistic frustration.

26:28.754 --> 26:32.418
Well, she never likes anyone
to pick her up or hold her.

26:32.716 --> 26:35.709
First, I want to make sure
she's not deaf.

26:36.011 --> 26:40.597
- I think she ought to see a specialist.
- You're the doctor.

26:40.891 --> 26:43.652
- Hey, we got it all moved in, chula.
- I don't know how to thank you.

26:43.894 --> 26:46.056
Sure you do.

26:46.355 --> 26:48.688
Hey, we're gonna have a party, huh?
Hey, Tito!

26:48.982 --> 26:51.628
- No, gentlemen, really. I have work to do.
- Hey, you got some wine?

26:51.652 --> 26:55.441
And I will get the first dance.

26:55.739 --> 26:58.231
- No, no. I am the first.
- Oh, no, gentlemen.

26:58.534 --> 27:00.776
- I really think you better go.
- After the party, eh?

27:01.078 --> 27:05.823
- No. No, now, please.
- You heard the lady. Out!

27:08.001 --> 27:10.618
Yeah, sure, we go.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.974
Thank you
very much, sir.

27:25.269 --> 27:28.512
A girl with a shape like yours
can do better than two-bit winos.

27:30.440 --> 27:33.649
I'm The Banker.
Who gave you permission...

27:33.944 --> 27:36.152
to set up shop in my territory?

27:36.446 --> 27:38.108
The Catholic Action Committee.

27:38.407 --> 27:42.947
Well, nowadays, everybody's
got a piece of the action.

27:45.581 --> 27:47.789
Did you stick something
in your eye, Tomas?

27:48.083 --> 27:52.123
- Mm-hmm. Somebody put their fist into his eye.
- Yeah, but I hit him good first.

27:52.421 --> 27:56.040
I don't let nobody
call my sister a dirty, stinking bitch.

27:56.341 --> 27:58.082
She ain't dirty.

27:58.385 --> 28:01.865
Well, you better let Desiree fight her own battles,
because she ain't lost one yet, pal.

28:01.972 --> 28:05.261
Hey, Doc, could I see you a second?
I, uh, have a problem.

28:05.559 --> 28:08.677
Okay. Put two drops
in your eye every four hours.

28:08.979 --> 28:12.063
- And you better put a patch on the champ's eye.
- Yes, Doctor.

28:22.492 --> 28:27.328
- Desiree!
- Oh, Doc. I have such a pain in my left chest.

28:27.623 --> 28:31.333
- Your left chest? Now wait a minute.
- Mm-hmm. A construction.

28:31.627 --> 28:34.665
- A what?
- A construction. I swear it on my mother's grave.

28:34.963 --> 28:37.956
- Your mother's alive.
- So, it could be something serious.

28:43.305 --> 28:46.048
All right. I better not
take any chances.

28:49.978 --> 28:52.561
There?
Um... yeah, right here.

28:57.527 --> 29:01.020
And it hurts when you breathe, right?
Yeah, yeah, it hurts.

29:09.289 --> 29:13.704
- Doc?
- A very interesting case.

29:14.002 --> 29:15.743
Well, what is it?

29:16.046 --> 29:20.882
- You know, you're lucky you came to me when you did.
- Oh, Doc, I was only kidding.

29:21.176 --> 29:24.169
No.

29:24.471 --> 29:28.556
- I don't know how to tell you this, kid.
- But-But...

29:28.850 --> 29:31.433
you've got to do something.
There's nothing I can do.

29:31.728 --> 29:34.088
You mean, I ain't gonna get over it?
Oh, you'll get over it.

29:34.231 --> 29:35.938
Well, what's wrong?

29:36.233 --> 29:40.227
It's called Septum Decimises.
Huh? What's that?

29:40.529 --> 29:43.647
That means that
you're 17 years old.

29:48.036 --> 29:50.278
Uh, Doctor?

29:50.580 --> 29:52.822
Mrs. Rodriguez is here.

29:53.125 --> 29:55.082
Uh, that's all, Camille.

29:56.336 --> 29:58.248
Yeah, for now.

30:02.592 --> 30:04.925
Mm.

30:17.316 --> 30:21.811
- Hello?
- Doctor, I think you better get over here right away.

30:22.112 --> 30:24.104
Yeah. Okay.

30:43.550 --> 30:45.587
You can stop the oxygen, Irene.

30:45.886 --> 30:49.345
- Is she...
- No, she's breathing very well on her own now.

30:49.639 --> 30:51.505
But it was touch-and-go
for a while.

30:53.226 --> 30:57.061
Did you call the ambulance, Michelle?
It's on its way.

30:57.356 --> 31:00.144
Good. You go back
to the clinic with me.

31:00.442 --> 31:02.980
We've done
all we can do here.

31:03.278 --> 31:06.021
Irene, you better stay
until the ambulance gets here.

31:19.711 --> 31:22.704
Hey, Doc.

31:23.006 --> 31:24.622
You call that specialist yet?

31:24.925 --> 31:27.542
He's supposed to get back to me
by the end of the week.

31:40.774 --> 31:43.061
- Miss Parker?
- Yeah?

31:43.360 --> 31:45.560
I want to see Amanda in my office
late Friday afternoon.

31:45.695 --> 31:48.108
Okay?
Whatever you say, Doc.

32:04.339 --> 32:06.251
You bring order and
organization into my life...

32:06.550 --> 32:09.258
and you're gonna ruin everything.
How are things at the hospital?

32:09.553 --> 32:12.671
Oh, just fine.
Miss Kempton goes home today.

32:12.973 --> 32:17.968
Oh. You really saved her life.
You were absolutely wonderful.

32:18.270 --> 32:21.308
You were pretty good yourself,
for a religious fanatic.

32:21.606 --> 32:24.440
Well, I'll, uh...

32:24.734 --> 32:28.023
I'll have Irene put her
on the visiting list for tomorrow, Doctor.

32:28.321 --> 32:30.984
We have a rule around here.
Any nurse that lasts out a full week...

32:31.283 --> 32:33.991
gets to call the doctor by his first name.

32:34.286 --> 32:37.450
Well, I'll try to
remember that... John.

32:37.747 --> 32:40.239
And we celebrate
by having a drink.

32:40.542 --> 32:42.784
Oh, we don't drink.
We don't drink?

32:43.086 --> 32:46.250
Well, uh, wh-what I mean is...

32:46.548 --> 32:48.961
a little wine, occasionally.

32:49.259 --> 32:51.342
We... I...

32:51.636 --> 32:53.923
What I mean is I...
I, uh, don't drink.

32:57.851 --> 33:00.810
Well, if a nurse doesn't drink,
then we usually have dinner.

33:01.104 --> 33:03.687
Yes, I'll bet you do.
But there's no chance.

33:03.982 --> 33:06.770
We're going to try to shame the landlord
into painting the apartment.

33:07.068 --> 33:09.422
You're gonna have to stop
throwing yourself at me like this...

33:09.446 --> 33:12.063
or people will start talking.

33:12.365 --> 33:14.152
Oh, by the way,
you were right about Amanda.

33:14.451 --> 33:17.319
She is autistic, she's not deaf,
'cause I heard her whistle.

33:17.621 --> 33:19.988
Well, I can start working
with her right away.

33:20.290 --> 33:23.499
I'll have to gain her confidence.
Show her love and affection.

33:23.793 --> 33:26.752
There are new techniques
that get results a lot faster.

33:27.047 --> 33:29.835
You mean rage reduction?

33:30.133 --> 33:31.840
I'd rather try patience and love.

33:32.135 --> 33:35.799
I hope we got that much time.
Y-You f-forget me.

33:37.390 --> 33:39.632
No, of course not, Julio.
Just go into the office.

33:39.935 --> 33:41.535
I'll be right with you.
You be all right?

33:41.770 --> 33:44.012
We'll be fine.
It's too bad about dinner.

33:44.314 --> 33:46.397
I was even gonna
pick up the check.

33:50.195 --> 33:53.529
So much?

33:53.823 --> 33:56.190
Oh, that's sheer highway robbery.

33:56.493 --> 33:59.952
- You ought to take out a license to steal, mister.
- Butt out, kid.

34:00.247 --> 34:03.115
You are a walking social injustice.

34:08.045 --> 34:11.585
Every week I try to save money
come Feast of Juan de Cheguez...

34:11.882 --> 34:14.125
so I can buy gifts
for the little ones.

34:14.427 --> 34:16.293
San Juan de Cheguez?

34:16.596 --> 34:18.963
Hey, isn't he the patron saint
of Caribbean fisherman?

34:19.266 --> 34:20.973
Oh, you know him?
Yeah.

34:21.268 --> 34:23.100
Oh, in Puerto Rico,
we have big fiesta...

34:23.395 --> 34:26.058
parade in the streets,
bless the boats.

34:26.356 --> 34:30.690
- Here, they do nothing but try to steal from you.
- You're holding up the line.

34:30.985 --> 34:33.069
Wait a minute.

34:33.362 --> 34:36.356
She gave you a 10 bill dollars.

34:42.621 --> 34:45.034
Oh, gracias.
Muchas gracias, senorita.

34:45.333 --> 34:49.077
- Oh, for the Feast of San Juan de Cheguez.
- Oh, muchas gracias.

34:58.888 --> 35:02.552
Mm.
Noodle ring again, huh?

35:02.851 --> 35:04.843
Mm-hmm.
Noodle ring again.

35:12.444 --> 35:15.357
Got it!
Yeech!

35:17.157 --> 35:19.149
Uh, if you don't like
my noodle ring...

35:19.451 --> 35:22.285
you should have accepted
Dr. Carpenter's invitation to dinner.

35:22.579 --> 35:25.287
I would have.
That'll be five Hail Marys.

35:25.582 --> 35:29.292
Nuns and men don't mix.
Oh, I think he's cute.

35:29.586 --> 35:31.578
- Fifteen.
- Honest. He's groovy.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.712
Twenty-five.

35:36.009 --> 35:37.921
Evening, ladies.
Evening.

35:45.518 --> 35:49.603
Brown paper bags.
I could hear the muscatel bottles rattle.

35:49.898 --> 35:53.642
All right, out of the way,
girls, unless you want to get painted.

35:53.943 --> 35:56.303
Luis, Raoul, start moving the furniture
away from the walls.

35:56.446 --> 35:59.655
Chino, you'll mix the paint.

35:59.949 --> 36:03.488
I know your landlord.
He doesn't shame so easily.

36:45.370 --> 36:47.973
It's too bad Chino and the rest of the boys
couldn't stay for dinner.

36:47.997 --> 36:50.740
Maybe they're not partial
to noodle ring like I am.

36:51.042 --> 36:53.375
Tell me, as a doctor...

36:53.670 --> 36:57.664
would you diagnose what's happening today...
the riots, the student unrest...

36:57.966 --> 37:01.380
as not really the death throes
of an old Order...

37:01.678 --> 37:03.294
But the birth pains of a new one?

37:03.596 --> 37:06.213
- I didn't know I was making a house call.
- Oh, well, I mean...

37:06.516 --> 37:09.554
don't we all, each in our own way,
have to man the barricades?

37:09.853 --> 37:13.688
- At the Ajax Market?
- Um.. If we're all finished?

37:13.982 --> 37:17.191
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

37:17.485 --> 37:19.192
We give Thee thanks,
Almighty God...

37:19.487 --> 37:21.927
for all Thy benefits
which we have received from Thy bounty...

37:22.031 --> 37:23.818
through Christ, our Lord, amen.

37:24.117 --> 37:27.485
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

37:27.787 --> 37:31.701
- I hear it's good for the digestion.
- It is.

37:45.305 --> 37:50.346
"Fiesta San Juan de Cheguez.
August 3, 4:00 to whatever.

37:50.643 --> 37:53.602
Free food, soft drinks.
Support your local patron saint. What is that?

37:53.897 --> 37:57.106
- Well, we're sponsoring it next Saturday.
- I'm against this.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.687
I think we're here
to do a job, not get involved.

37:59.986 --> 38:02.945
Well, I'm for it.
It'll make an awful lot of people very happy.

38:03.239 --> 38:05.572
And happy people
are closer to God.

38:05.867 --> 38:08.701
Look, I don't get it.
What are you, nurses or missionaries?

38:08.995 --> 38:10.861
I think you should
drop the whole thing.

38:11.164 --> 38:14.282
The hospital can't handle
the usual casualties on Saturday night.

38:14.584 --> 38:16.792
Oh, look,
Chino forgot his guitar.

38:17.086 --> 38:19.920
- Won't he need this?
- He could always steal another one.

38:20.215 --> 38:22.423
- Oh.
- Do you think there'll be trouble?

38:22.717 --> 38:24.424
Trouble?
At the fiesta?

38:24.719 --> 38:27.406
You know how it is on a Saturday night down here.
You get everybody together...

38:27.430 --> 38:29.750
blowing out their skulls,
and all the old hates come out...

38:29.933 --> 38:32.013
and you may wind up
with World War III on your hands.

38:32.227 --> 38:34.469
Oh, please don't say that.
It's important to us.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.976
Okay.

38:38.274 --> 38:40.186
Go ahead and have your party
for old Sam Chavez.

38:40.485 --> 38:42.922
But if you really want to get to know
some of the kids around here...

38:42.946 --> 38:45.132
why don't you come down to the park
on a Saturday afternoon...

38:45.156 --> 38:47.318
when we play touch football?
Oh.

38:47.617 --> 38:49.324
Let me show you how to do this.

38:49.619 --> 38:52.612
Put these three fingers
right here, honey. Like that.

38:54.541 --> 38:57.830
Go ahead.

38:58.127 --> 39:01.837
That's right.
Now this one right here.

39:02.131 --> 39:04.839
Very good.
Now these three here.

39:05.134 --> 39:07.501
What?
These three right here.

39:07.804 --> 39:10.342
Now you got a complete
chord change.

39:10.640 --> 39:12.927
Now, see, go back to this one.
Um...

39:13.226 --> 39:16.060
Right.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.186
Now back to this one.

39:19.899 --> 39:22.687
Disgusting movie.

39:22.986 --> 39:25.979
You were right making that
man give us our money back.

39:26.281 --> 39:28.113
When you see
pictures like that...

39:28.408 --> 39:31.697
you realize what a great force
for good Irene Dunne was.

39:37.250 --> 39:39.037
Say, I didn't know
you could do that.

39:39.335 --> 39:41.042
At this hour.

39:41.337 --> 39:44.796
It's got to be an orgy.

39:51.264 --> 39:53.176
Hey, this is fun.

39:53.474 --> 39:57.388
Father Gibbons will certainly
want to hear about this.

40:00.440 --> 40:03.399
I'm not ready.
I'm not ready.

40:18.374 --> 40:22.243
Ah, come on.
Come on.

40:22.545 --> 40:26.505
- That was really terrific.
- Um, give me a hand. Let's get this picture up.

40:26.799 --> 40:30.167
- I'll help.
- That's okay. We can do it ourselves. Thank you.

40:30.470 --> 40:32.553
It's okay.

40:32.847 --> 40:34.964
I'm better
in the kitchen anyway.

40:39.729 --> 40:43.063
What do you know?
We're finally alone.

40:45.818 --> 40:47.901
John, uh, please don't.

40:49.238 --> 40:51.104
I get the feeling
there's a message here.

40:51.407 --> 40:53.273
Like maybe there's somebody else?

40:55.036 --> 40:58.074
You...
you could say that, yes.

40:59.582 --> 41:02.746
Message received.
Good night, Michelle.

41:26.359 --> 41:29.272
Why don't you join
the Y.M.C.A?

41:29.570 --> 41:31.311
You'd save us both
a lot of wear and tear...

41:31.614 --> 41:33.981
if you'd learn to duck
every once in a while, okay?

41:36.369 --> 41:38.486
Okay, Miss Parker.

41:39.622 --> 41:42.581
Come on.
Mandy.

41:42.875 --> 41:47.085
Mandy, come on.

41:47.380 --> 41:49.747
Barbara, take over.
I don't want to be disturbed...

41:50.049 --> 41:51.881
unless it's an emergency.

42:04.063 --> 42:07.397
Do you see that?
Put it right there in that hole.

42:11.237 --> 42:13.775
Come on, darling, take it.

42:14.073 --> 42:17.032
Take it.
Put it in your hand.

42:17.326 --> 42:20.865
That's a girl.
Now put it right...

42:21.164 --> 42:24.999
Ah. Mm-hmm.
Let's try that one more time.

42:25.293 --> 42:27.376
Put it right here.

42:27.670 --> 42:32.916
Come on, put it...
No, no, no. No. Put it...

42:37.055 --> 42:39.388
All right, Amanda,
let's try again.

42:39.682 --> 42:42.049
Put it right... there.

42:47.315 --> 42:50.899
Amanda, put it there.

42:51.194 --> 42:54.904
You can do it. Come on.
You're doing it.

42:55.198 --> 42:57.030
Come on, baby.

42:57.325 --> 43:00.909
Good girl, Amanda.
Very good...

43:01.204 --> 43:04.914
- It's not gonna work, Michelle.
- I don't expect to make too much progress at first.

43:05.208 --> 43:06.949
She's hiding behind
a wall of anger.

43:07.251 --> 43:11.621
It's not gonna work.
I'll take over. We'll try rage reduction.

43:14.509 --> 43:16.546
Take her doll away from her.

43:20.306 --> 43:22.719
No, Amanda.
No more toys, baby.

43:23.017 --> 43:24.724
You got to learn
to start loving people.

43:25.019 --> 43:28.638
I'm gonna hold you till you get rid of all your hate.
Get as mad as you can.

43:28.940 --> 43:31.227
Then you can start
to give love and take love.

43:32.735 --> 43:34.897
Try to get away from me,
baby. Try and get away.

43:35.196 --> 43:37.563
I love you, Amanda.

43:37.865 --> 43:39.982
Don't you like
when people love you?

43:40.284 --> 43:42.364
Come on. I want to see you
get as mad as you can get.

43:42.411 --> 43:44.118
Get all that hate out of you.

43:44.413 --> 43:46.996
Miss Gallagher?

43:47.291 --> 43:49.954
He won't hurt her.

43:50.253 --> 43:52.085
Let's see how mad
you can get, baby.

44:06.519 --> 44:09.808
Oh, um, I'm sorry.
The doctor's tied up right now.

44:11.065 --> 44:13.899
I come back tomorrow.

44:17.655 --> 44:19.567
Get mad.

44:24.203 --> 44:26.286
Come on, let it out.

44:26.581 --> 44:28.493
It's Amanda.

44:28.791 --> 44:31.283
I can take over here.
Why don't you go in and help them?

44:36.382 --> 44:38.374
Okay.

44:40.303 --> 44:43.387
I love you, Amanda.
I love you.

44:49.395 --> 44:52.433
Love you, baby.
Is that as mad as you can get?

44:53.900 --> 44:55.766
Michelle.

44:56.068 --> 44:57.855
Get as mad as you can get.

44:58.154 --> 45:00.862
Hold her feet.

45:01.157 --> 45:03.194
It's okay.
We're not gonna hurt her.

45:03.492 --> 45:05.233
Come on, show us
how mad you can get.

45:07.079 --> 45:09.036
- Get mad.
- I love you, Amanda.

45:15.004 --> 45:17.041
Come on, fight.
You can do better than that..

45:17.340 --> 45:20.799
For somebody who loves you.

45:23.387 --> 45:26.346
- Is that as mad as you can get?
- Come on, that's a girl.

45:26.641 --> 45:29.884
Good girl.

45:30.186 --> 45:33.554
Come on, Miss Parker,
we'll wait outside.

45:33.856 --> 45:37.065
- Look at me. Look at me.
- Get good and mad, Amanda.

45:39.445 --> 45:42.108
Get mad.

45:42.406 --> 45:45.240
Love you.
I love you, Amanda.

45:45.534 --> 45:48.868
- Is that the best you can do for somebody who loves you?
- We love you, Amanda.

45:49.163 --> 45:51.906
Come on, that's it. Fight.
Get mad, Amanda.

45:54.627 --> 45:56.664
Come on, show us
how mad you can get.

46:01.509 --> 46:03.842
Get as mad as you can, Amanda.

46:07.974 --> 46:10.057
Come on, you can do
better than that.

46:10.351 --> 46:14.061
Let it out.

46:14.355 --> 46:16.722
Yell. That a girl.
Let it all aut.

46:17.024 --> 46:19.812
- We love you, baby.
- Let it go.

46:21.737 --> 46:25.151
- Come on, baby. Get mad.
- Mad.

46:26.617 --> 46:29.451
Big girl.
You can talk, Amanda.

46:29.745 --> 46:33.705
Mad. Mad.
Mad.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.117
That's a girl.
Say it louder. Mad!

46:36.419 --> 46:38.251
Mad.
Very good.

46:38.546 --> 46:40.708
Say it as loud as you can, mad!
Mad!

46:41.007 --> 46:44.500
Oh, Amanda, we love you.

46:44.802 --> 46:47.419
Love you.
Love you.

46:47.722 --> 46:50.305
Love.
Love.

46:50.599 --> 46:52.966
Love...
Love...

46:53.269 --> 46:55.306
you.
- You.

46:55.604 --> 46:58.938
Love you.
Love you.

46:59.233 --> 47:01.896
Love you.
Love you.

47:02.194 --> 47:05.733
Yes, that's a big girl.
Big girl.

47:07.992 --> 47:10.405
Big girl.
Big girl.

47:10.703 --> 47:12.990
Yeah.

47:15.875 --> 47:18.208
Yes, sweetheart. Yes.

47:27.303 --> 47:31.422
I want you to show them how
you can get real good and mad, like a big girl.

47:31.724 --> 47:34.182
I want you to hit my hand
as hard as you can.

47:34.477 --> 47:36.437
Come on, you can do better than that.
Hit it hard.

47:36.604 --> 47:39.972
Good, baby. Hit it again.
Very good.

47:40.274 --> 47:42.106
Hit it again.

47:42.401 --> 47:44.518
Good. Good, baby.
Hit it again, one more time.

47:44.820 --> 47:48.860
Good girl.
That's a big girl.

47:49.158 --> 47:51.115
You gonna give me a hug?

47:57.249 --> 47:59.741
You wanna go home?
Home.

48:01.003 --> 48:04.041
Amanda?

48:04.340 --> 48:06.673
Come.

48:09.261 --> 48:12.095
Oh.
Hungry.

48:24.110 --> 48:26.727
You did it.
We did it.

48:30.366 --> 48:32.858
Um... excuse me.

48:37.748 --> 48:39.614
Those two trees
are the goals at that end...

48:39.917 --> 48:41.624
these two trees
are the goals down here.

48:41.919 --> 48:44.119
Trash cans are out of bounds.
Two hands below the waist.

48:44.296 --> 48:48.085
You understand the rules?
In the words of the master, fake it for 32 bars.

48:48.384 --> 48:50.546
Let's go.
Hey, where's Irene?

48:50.845 --> 48:53.428
She has too many
house calls to make.

48:53.722 --> 48:55.429
Here we go.

48:55.724 --> 48:59.468
I fell.
You understand? I fell.

48:59.770 --> 49:01.511
You've been beaten.

49:01.814 --> 49:04.978
- I'll have to report this to the police.
- No! They will kill him.

49:07.153 --> 49:09.987
- Who will kill him?
- The Banker. You don't know how...

49:16.787 --> 49:18.619
You listen to me now.

49:18.914 --> 49:23.249
You fix my ribs,
you give me pills.

49:23.544 --> 49:25.251
This your job.

49:25.546 --> 49:29.460
Anything else,
we all get hurt.

49:35.181 --> 49:37.826
You'll have to keep him in bed.
He cannot go to work in this condition.

49:37.850 --> 49:40.217
He has to.
They will come back for the money on payday.

49:56.702 --> 49:59.285
Cool it.
Junk ain't our bag, sister.

49:59.580 --> 50:03.790
Hey, brother:
She don't want to be our sister.

50:04.084 --> 50:07.122
- If you'll excuse me, I have calls to make.
- They'll wait.

50:07.421 --> 50:09.378
We gotta know where you stand.

50:11.050 --> 50:12.916
I'm a nurse.
That's where I stand.

50:13.219 --> 50:16.212
There's no room down here
for innocent bystanders.

50:16.514 --> 50:19.678
You're either part of the problem
or you're part of the solution.

50:19.975 --> 50:21.762
We've got a feeling
you're neither.

50:22.061 --> 50:25.270
Well, I'm a Negro.
I think that's pretty obvious.

50:25.564 --> 50:30.855
Now where you been, sister?
We ain't Negroes, we're black.

50:31.153 --> 50:34.442
Not her.
She's just been dipped in maple syrup.

50:34.740 --> 50:38.199
You don't talk to me about being black.
I've been black all my life.

50:38.494 --> 50:40.775
- So I don't want to hear that.
- Everything but the soul.

50:40.996 --> 50:44.706
- You copped aut.
- I never have. I've done my part.

50:45.000 --> 50:48.084
For you. Not for us.

50:48.379 --> 50:50.621
See, you're locked in
with those ofay chicks.

50:50.923 --> 50:52.789
Well, you can't
have it both ways.

50:53.092 --> 50:55.835
Get it together or get out.

50:56.136 --> 50:58.048
You're too pretty
not to stay pretty.

51:07.398 --> 51:13.110
Hike!
Cut back, Carlos!

51:17.575 --> 51:20.943
Touchdown!
Atta way, Carlos!

51:25.291 --> 51:28.211
- Oh, you should have had it. You should have had it.
- Oh, no! I'm sorry!

51:28.377 --> 51:31.211
- Where'd you learn to pass like that, kid?
- I had five brothers.

51:31.505 --> 51:33.918
- They taught you?
- No, I taught them.

51:34.216 --> 51:36.424
- Oh.
- We gotta kick off.

51:41.807 --> 51:43.719
Ah.

51:46.312 --> 51:49.146
Okay, gang, let's go.
Here we go.

51:50.482 --> 51:52.724
Block their defensive tackle
coming in this time.

51:53.027 --> 51:55.519
If he tries to get past me...
Pffft... I cut him. Cool it.

51:55.821 --> 51:58.484
Fifteen-yard penalty.
Illegal use of knives.

51:58.782 --> 52:01.525
Now look, you guys block,
and you go short right over the line.

52:01.827 --> 52:03.659
Okay, break!

52:05.581 --> 52:07.914
Red dog that passer!

52:08.208 --> 52:10.621
Okay, down Set.
All right, go team. Come on!

52:10.919 --> 52:13.627
Hike!

52:25.351 --> 52:27.468
You blindsided me.
Oh, I'm sorry.

52:27.770 --> 52:29.978
I'm a little overtrained, kid.

52:30.272 --> 52:33.015
Okay, the Slum Bowl Game
is now part of sports history.

52:33.317 --> 52:35.479
So how about an ice cream cone, huh?
Oh, I'd love it.

52:35.778 --> 52:39.021
- Hey, let's find Amanda. She loves ice cream.
- Okay.

52:50.209 --> 52:54.328
A few hours on a Sunday afternoon,
and then back to Washington Street.

52:54.630 --> 52:57.668
Washington Street.

52:57.966 --> 53:00.879
It sounds as if
it should have elm trees...

53:01.178 --> 53:05.138
and frame houses
with big white pillars in front.

53:07.017 --> 53:08.849
What brought you to the clinic?

53:09.144 --> 53:12.808
A sergeant in my outfit
in the army named Cal Edwards.

53:13.107 --> 53:14.939
He was from Washington Street.

53:17.027 --> 53:19.565
- You don't want to hear about it, do you?
- Cal Edwards.

53:19.863 --> 53:21.946
He's not one
of our patients, is he?

53:22.241 --> 53:24.858
He was killed on the other
side of the world.

53:25.160 --> 53:27.447
Where's the ice cream stand?

53:27.746 --> 53:30.454
He must have been
a very good friend of yours.

53:30.749 --> 53:33.207
He saved my life once.

53:33.502 --> 53:38.293
So I figured I owed him and Washington Street
a few of the years he gave me.

53:38.590 --> 53:40.923
Anyway, I learned more here
than I would in the suburbs...

53:41.218 --> 53:43.961
giving out diet pills
and vitamin shots.

53:48.559 --> 53:50.596
Say it, Amanda.
Go on, say it.

53:50.894 --> 53:53.056
Ice cream, ice cream, ice cream.

53:53.355 --> 53:56.189
Good girl.
Let's get some.

54:02.614 --> 54:05.527
Up we go, baby.
That's a girl.

54:05.826 --> 54:08.864
Amanda wants strawberry.
Make that two.

54:10.038 --> 54:12.872
And for the missus?
Uh...

54:14.710 --> 54:17.748
chocolate.
Here you go, kiddo.

54:18.046 --> 54:20.129
What do you say?

54:20.424 --> 54:23.132
- Good.
- Good. Very good.

54:25.345 --> 54:27.428
That'll be 30 cents.

54:36.815 --> 54:39.057
Amanda, how about
a nice, big smile?

54:40.652 --> 54:43.269
A little smile?

54:43.572 --> 54:46.940
How about a grin?

54:49.703 --> 54:52.741
This calls for
a special kind of magic.

57:09.718 --> 57:11.630
Hey, Julio!

57:16.475 --> 57:19.764
Well, now, why do you suppose
he ran off like that?

57:20.062 --> 57:21.928
Julio's a boy
with big problems.

57:22.230 --> 57:27.100
It's his stuttering, makes him feel inadequate.
I am making headway with him.

57:27.402 --> 57:30.362
You take away his stuttering,
you're going to find he has a deeper problem.

57:30.447 --> 57:32.564
I don't think you want
any part of that.

57:35.494 --> 57:37.861
Oh, thank you.

57:38.163 --> 57:41.452
Maybe you're wrong about Julio.
You were wrong about Amanda.

57:41.750 --> 57:44.083
I hope so.

57:48.924 --> 57:51.792
There's one thing I'm not
wrong about, Michelle.

57:52.094 --> 57:54.802
The other night when I put my arms around you,
it was no accident.

57:55.097 --> 57:57.305
It was intentional.

57:57.599 --> 58:00.933
And I learned something from it,
'cause you didn't quite level with me.

58:01.228 --> 58:03.561
There isn't anyone else.

58:55.115 --> 58:56.902
Thanks for an absolutely
marvelous day.

58:57.200 --> 59:01.444
Now you know
how the other half plays.

59:03.832 --> 59:07.246
Well...
Me for the sack.

59:07.544 --> 59:11.709
And me for the sackcloth
and the ashes.

59:14.259 --> 59:16.751
Church?
I gotta talk to somebody.

59:17.054 --> 59:20.388
Oh, you're not going all the way uptown
to the convent at this hour?

59:20.682 --> 59:23.174
No, we have a church
right here in the neighborhood.

59:23.477 --> 59:26.311
Father Gibbons?
He will burn you at the stake.

59:26.605 --> 59:30.519
Not exactly an apostle
of the ecumenical movement.

59:30.817 --> 59:32.979
Uh, no, more the Inquisition.

59:33.278 --> 59:36.567
But still a priest.
I better get changed.

59:36.865 --> 59:41.075
A lovely supper, ladies:
I'll look for you at early mass.

59:41.369 --> 59:44.703
Father Gibbons,
I'm so glad I ran into you.

59:44.998 --> 59:47.911
Oh, we were playing
touch football in the park.

59:48.210 --> 59:51.169
Notre Dame,
French for "Our Lady."

59:51.463 --> 59:54.126
But I don't think Our Lady'd
be very proud to claim you now.

59:54.424 --> 59:57.132
Father, we've done nothing
to be ashamed of.

59:57.427 --> 01:00:02.593
Men in your rooms. Late parties.
Profane music till all hours.

01:00:02.891 --> 01:00:06.180
Forsaking the habit was one thing,
but now you're not even dressed like females.

01:00:06.478 --> 01:00:08.640
Father...
I've had enough of you.

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:12.432
- I want you out of my parish.
- Oh, please don't say that.

01:00:12.734 --> 01:00:15.693
I'll have none of your arguments.
I've called Bishop Finley...

01:00:15.987 --> 01:00:17.867
and we're seeing him
at 11:00 on Monday morning.

01:00:18.073 --> 01:00:21.191
If you feel you can make
a case for your conduct, do it then.

01:00:21.493 --> 01:00:24.657
Good night...
Sisters.

01:00:52.149 --> 01:00:54.311
Hello, I was looking for you.

01:00:54.609 --> 01:00:56.529
I can't help you, Banker,
I'm not a veterinarian.

01:00:56.778 --> 01:00:58.610
That's funny.

01:00:58.905 --> 01:01:02.819
No, you shook down a manager of the Ajax Market.
That's not so funny.

01:01:03.118 --> 01:01:04.825
You stay away from my clientele.

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:08.488
You stay away from my clinic.
Oh, I got clientele in your clinic.

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:12.625
You ask that nurse
that's working for you.

01:01:21.219 --> 01:01:23.006
Good morning, doctor.
Good morning.

01:01:23.305 --> 01:01:26.325
I'm going to help you out with early customers.
Michelle and Barbara had to go uptown.

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:29.763
- Some kind of meeting?
- Mmm... some kind of meeting is right.

01:01:30.061 --> 01:01:32.678
What business do you have
with The Banker?

01:01:34.649 --> 01:01:40.111
A hundred dollars worth.
It's my contribution to the Feast of San Juan de Cheguez.

01:01:40.405 --> 01:01:42.488
You can't borrow money
from The Banker.

01:01:42.782 --> 01:01:44.844
Oh, I thought it was practically
a neighborhood tradition.

01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:47.076
So is knife fighting
and joy popping.

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:50.863
Well, I have a week to pay
him back, until the fiesta.

01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:54.659
Let's see, six-to-five,
that's 120 for the 100.

01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:58.545
And if the borrower doesn't pay back,
The Banker usually breaks a leg or a head.

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.547
You're really asking
for trouble, Irene.

01:02:00.842 --> 01:02:03.084
Yes, I am.
I have no intention of paying him back.

01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:07.130
- You don't understand...
- No, it's you who don't understand, Dr. Carpenter.

01:02:07.432 --> 01:02:10.470
You see I've decided Barbara's right.
We have to get involved.

01:02:10.769 --> 01:02:13.056
- I've been running from reality.
- Oh, come on.

01:02:13.355 --> 01:02:15.115
A nurse is usually
up to her ears in reality.

01:02:15.357 --> 01:02:17.144
No. I have to face it.

01:02:17.442 --> 01:02:21.311
I have used my vocation
to get away from all the things I've ever known.

01:02:21.613 --> 01:02:24.572
Doctor, do you know
what it is to be really poor?

01:02:24.866 --> 01:02:28.359
I mean, hungry and frightened?
To be black?

01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:30.779
I've been all those things,
except black.

01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:36.125
While little white girls were playing with dolls
and wearing party dresses...

01:02:36.419 --> 01:02:39.537
I was dodging drunks
in dark hallways...

01:02:39.839 --> 01:02:42.422
praying I could get away
from the stench of the ghetto...

01:02:42.717 --> 01:02:47.212
so I could be somebody,
not just another nigger in the streets.

01:02:47.514 --> 01:02:50.131
Good morning.
Oh, Miss Parker, Amanda.

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:53.073
Just have a seat in the waiting room.
I'll be with you in a minute.

01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:56.889
Irene, it's not my place
to tell anybody when to fish or cut bait.

01:02:57.190 --> 01:03:00.558
Let's just hope it doesn't turn out to be fish
or get your throat cut.

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:08.233
They shame the other fine Sisters of the cloth,
who know their place.

01:03:08.535 --> 01:03:12.199
Our place is where we're needed.
How we dress in unimportant.

01:03:12.497 --> 01:03:14.409
You're no longer needed
in my parish.

01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:17.542
Something is needed
in your parish, Father Gibbons.

01:03:17.836 --> 01:03:21.329
There are new methods,
innovations. For instance...

01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:25.420
you might try bringing more people back into the church
by having a mass in Spanish.

01:03:25.719 --> 01:03:28.757
Or a folk mass.
Don't instruct me, Sister.

01:03:29.055 --> 01:03:31.843
I've preached more sermons
in my time than you'll ever hear.

01:03:32.142 --> 01:03:35.510
Yes, I'm sure we can always count
on you to tell it like it was, Father.

01:03:38.231 --> 01:03:41.975
I apologize to you
for that, Father.

01:03:42.277 --> 01:03:44.018
I approved this project
in the first place

01:03:44.321 --> 01:03:49.783
Because we all realized that we need new methods,
new forms to reach this generation:

01:03:50.076 --> 01:03:53.240
But some of the incidents that
Father Gibbons has been describing to me.

01:03:53.538 --> 01:03:57.657
But no one knows
we're nuns, Your Excellency.

01:03:57.959 --> 01:04:00.542
You know, Sister Barbara.

01:04:00.837 --> 01:04:04.626
- Tell the commissioner I can see him at 2:00 this afternoon.
- Yes, sir.

01:04:04.924 --> 01:04:08.213
I realized it was a great risk sending them
out to mix with the world...

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:10.798
And not have them mixed up by it.

01:04:11.097 --> 01:04:16.058
Inexperienced people who get emotionally involved
can often do more harm than good.

01:04:16.353 --> 01:04:19.846
Among our first lessons is
the importance of order, discipline.

01:04:20.148 --> 01:04:23.141
Not license and wantonness.

01:04:23.443 --> 01:04:28.939
I want them out of my parish and I want this festival
they've dreamed up canceled.

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:31.640
The whole neighborhood's been
sharpening their switch knives.

01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:34.368
And polishing their brass knuckles
for the past two weeks.

01:04:37.916 --> 01:04:40.454
Maybe we should consider
canceling this celebration...

01:04:40.752 --> 01:04:42.459
before it endangers
the whole project.

01:04:42.754 --> 01:04:44.746
We can't do that,
Your Excellency.

01:04:45.048 --> 01:04:48.917
These people are counting on celebrating
the Feast Day of San Juan de Cheguez.

01:04:49.219 --> 01:04:50.960
We must not disappoint them.

01:04:54.391 --> 01:04:57.008
All right, Sister.
You can go ahead with it.

01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:00.811
If you'll excuse me,
Your Excellency.

01:05:01.106 --> 01:05:04.770
You're excused, Father Gibbons.

01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:07.685
San Juan de Cheguez...

01:05:07.987 --> 01:05:10.695
I doubt he ever drove a single snake
out of Puerto Rico.

01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:15.109
- Thank you, Your Excellency.
- Thank you.

01:05:15.412 --> 01:05:18.996
I do think, however, that the Sisters must resume
wearing their habits.

01:05:19.290 --> 01:05:21.202
I can't think of one good reason.

01:05:21.501 --> 01:05:24.039
Well, may I give you two?

01:05:24.337 --> 01:05:27.057
First, none of us wants to embarrass the church.
Equally important...

01:05:27.257 --> 01:05:31.217
Wearing your habits guarantees
you a certain amount of personal safety.

01:05:31.511 --> 01:05:34.879
After all, the church
doesn't need martyrs in wholesale lots.

01:05:35.181 --> 01:05:39.425
But there's so much we haven't
accomplished yet as women.

01:05:43.815 --> 01:05:46.057
It's either that
or you return to the convent.

01:05:48.570 --> 01:05:50.357
Thank you, Your Excellency.

01:05:50.655 --> 01:05:52.396
Mother Joseph.

01:05:52.699 --> 01:05:54.907
Mother Joseph.

01:06:09.757 --> 01:06:13.341
Rose! For the love of heaven,
you've got to see this.

01:06:18.183 --> 01:06:20.891
Good morning, ladies.

01:06:21.186 --> 01:06:25.806
They're nuns.
Saints preserve us, they're nuns.

01:06:26.107 --> 01:06:31.193
Wild parties, pagan music,
men at all hours.

01:06:31.488 --> 01:06:34.071
Whatever they done,
they must've had good cause.

01:06:47.962 --> 01:06:49.874
Good morning, Desiree.

01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:54.212
Oh, uh...

01:06:54.511 --> 01:06:58.346
if you like, I have a dress
you might want to wear to the fiesta tonight.

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:01.383
Yeah, sure. Okay.

01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:05.052
We can hardly wait.
We're really going to blow this block apart.

01:07:05.355 --> 01:07:09.019
As a favor to us, I fervently hope
that you don't do that.

01:07:11.986 --> 01:07:14.478
And I was worried
about you and the doc.

01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:18.365
Yes, well, then, if you'd like
to come over this afternoon.

01:07:28.086 --> 01:07:32.421
Uh, Sisters, why don't you
go on to the clinic without me?

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:34.985
Please, tell doctor Carpenter
I'll be there as soon as I can.

01:07:35.009 --> 01:07:38.468
I have a rendezvous with destiny
at the Ajax Market.

01:07:38.763 --> 01:07:42.052
Sister Barbara!
I know. Order and discipline.

01:07:42.350 --> 01:07:45.343
Well, I'm being
willfully disobedient.

01:07:49.816 --> 01:07:53.230
That is called
doing your own thing.

01:07:57.991 --> 01:08:00.351
Are you sure you don't want me
to go to the clinic with you?

01:08:00.493 --> 01:08:02.701
No, no. You've got
your calls to make.

01:08:27.729 --> 01:08:31.393
A dollar-seventeen.

01:08:33.568 --> 01:08:36.732
For you, Sister, 85 cents.

01:08:37.029 --> 01:08:39.147
Oh, well, thank you, sir.

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:41.862
You're welcome.

01:08:50.417 --> 01:08:52.626
Oh, it's you!

01:09:01.429 --> 01:09:04.671
- John?
- Oh, you're early. Good.

01:09:07.225 --> 01:09:09.013
John, I want to talk to you.

01:09:09.312 --> 01:09:12.975
We got those polio shots today.
We'll have kids coming out of the woodwork.

01:09:13.274 --> 01:09:15.015
John, please.

01:09:15.318 --> 01:09:17.856
You gotta be kidding.

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:23.149
I'm a member of the Order
of the Little Sisters of Mary.

01:09:23.451 --> 01:09:26.785
We were only going to
be here for two months.

01:09:29.457 --> 01:09:32.291
John, please say something.

01:09:32.585 --> 01:09:35.042
I'll be damned.

01:09:36.214 --> 01:09:38.546
I'm sorry.

01:09:39.008 --> 01:09:43.752
We would've gone away, and you and I
would never have seen each other again.

01:09:44.055 --> 01:09:46.421
You could've told me, you know.
I couldn't.

01:09:46.724 --> 01:09:50.434
It was an experiment.
We weren't to tell anyone that we were nuns.

01:09:50.728 --> 01:09:53.435
Even after you saw I was
getting hung up on you.

01:09:54.732 --> 01:09:58.100
That was wrong for both of us.

01:09:58.403 --> 01:10:00.110
I took vows.

01:10:00.405 --> 01:10:03.819
Didn't you take a vow of honesty?

01:10:10.415 --> 01:10:11.415
Hello?

01:10:11.666 --> 01:10:15.910
Excuse me, please. Thank you.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Thank you.

01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:18.875
Uh, pardon me, please.
Thank you.

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:26.504
Get the fire hoses and the police dogs.
We are not moving.

01:10:26.806 --> 01:10:30.846
We are here to end the discriminatory practices
in the Ajax Market.

01:10:32.812 --> 01:10:36.522
I don't employ obsolete tactics to deal
with a contemporary situation.

01:10:42.447 --> 01:10:44.655
Buenos dia's,
Señora Gavilan.

01:10:44.949 --> 01:10:46.941
Buenos dia's, Señor Officer.

01:10:51.414 --> 01:10:53.622
Mm-hmm... do you hear him
threatening her?

01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:55.748
He asked her
how her legs felt.

01:10:56.043 --> 01:10:59.332
Call in your goons.
Fire your tear gas bombs.

01:10:59.630 --> 01:11:03.294
In a potentially violent confrontation,
it's imperative law enforcement officials...

01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:05.696
should conduct themselves
with calm and understanding.

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.212
Club us! Load us into
that paddy wagon out there...

01:11:08.514 --> 01:11:10.631
and we will bear our scars proudly.

01:11:10.933 --> 01:11:13.892
The only scars you'll bear will be splinters,
Sister Barbara.

01:11:14.187 --> 01:11:17.055
A law officer should always remember
to keep his own good humor...

01:11:17.356 --> 01:11:20.645
Even in the face of vituperative comment
and obscenities.

01:11:20.943 --> 01:11:22.684
Dirty establishment fink!

01:11:29.827 --> 01:11:33.116
I destroyed property.
I fermented a riot.

01:11:33.414 --> 01:11:36.282
I demand to be arrested.
You're not going to get your wish.

01:11:36.584 --> 01:11:38.584
Where are the reporters
and the television cameras?

01:11:38.836 --> 01:11:40.623
I want to be dragged out
by my heels.

01:11:40.922 --> 01:11:43.835
If you care to come by
the station house...

01:11:44.133 --> 01:11:48.298
we might discuss environmental social pressures
and how they affect present-day society.

01:11:48.596 --> 01:11:50.462
Ooh, police brutality!
Come on. Let's go.

01:11:56.813 --> 01:11:58.270
Hmph.

01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:39.765
Who's there?

01:12:40.064 --> 01:12:42.397
St-Statue.

01:12:44.402 --> 01:12:46.735
Stay where you are!
For fiesta.

01:12:48.406 --> 01:12:50.898
Dirty, little thief!

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:53.908
Come back! Thief!

01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:57.241
Robber! Vandal!
Come back here!

01:13:34.952 --> 01:13:37.911
You want mustard?
All right, two with mustard.

01:14:04.774 --> 01:14:07.357
Lieutenant.

01:14:09.487 --> 01:14:13.356
Everything's quiet so far.
No sign of the Hernandez kid, Julio.

01:14:13.658 --> 01:14:16.651
- When you find him, try to take him quietly.
- Yes, sir.

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:38.139
Hello, John.

01:14:39.892 --> 01:14:42.635
I'm glad you decided
to come tonight, John.

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:44.515
Yeah.

01:14:45.356 --> 01:14:47.143
Well, what do you think
of our party?

01:14:48.901 --> 01:14:50.984
I can feel the lid rattling.

01:14:51.278 --> 01:14:54.191
When it blows,
you're gonna need a doctor.

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:56.857
Hello, Amanda!

01:14:59.954 --> 01:15:02.321
I've been looking
all over for you.

01:15:02.623 --> 01:15:04.535
Hello, Miss Parker.
Hello.

01:15:04.834 --> 01:15:06.541
You having a good time?

01:15:06.836 --> 01:15:11.797
I think you've been having hot dogs.
I see a little mustard here and there.

01:15:12.091 --> 01:15:15.801
Isn't it just terrific?
I never thought we'd get this many people.

01:15:16.095 --> 01:15:19.213
The magic combination.
Sam Cheguez and free booze.

01:15:19.515 --> 01:15:21.302
Alcohol?
Where did that come from?

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:23.466
I got an idea.

01:15:39.577 --> 01:15:42.820
Oh, I see. I see.

01:15:44.749 --> 01:15:48.493
Mother Joseph! Oh, I'm
so glad you could come.

01:15:48.794 --> 01:15:53.209
Well, the fishing catch of Puerto Rico
should reach record proportions this year.

01:15:53.507 --> 01:15:57.296
This is Amanda.
She's a little shy with strangers.

01:15:57.595 --> 01:16:00.929
Sometimes she likes her puppet
to do the talking for her.

01:16:01.223 --> 01:16:04.216
Hello, dear.
And what is your name?

01:16:04.518 --> 01:16:08.512
My name is Irene.
When little white girls was playing with dolls...

01:16:08.814 --> 01:16:10.806
I was praying
I could be somebody...

01:16:11.108 --> 01:16:13.441
and not just another
nigger in the streets.

01:16:15.029 --> 01:16:16.611
Oh, dear.

01:16:19.450 --> 01:16:21.533
You borrowed money.
I want it back.

01:16:21.827 --> 01:16:25.286
You're not gonna get it.
You have made a donation.

01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:29.165
Now look here, Sister...
whatever it is you are...

01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:34.330
- your time's up.
- I've declared a moratorium on that debt.

01:16:34.632 --> 01:16:37.045
A moratorium
for the whole neighborhood.

01:16:37.343 --> 01:16:39.300
- You better cool it, Irene.
- Butt out!

01:16:41.972 --> 01:16:43.554
Stop the music!

01:16:43.849 --> 01:16:45.636
Stop the music!

01:16:45.935 --> 01:16:47.801
In honor of
San Juan de Cheguez...

01:16:48.104 --> 01:16:50.687
All debts to The Banker
are hereby canceled.

01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:59.896
- You sure do like trouble, Irene.
- She's gonna get it.

01:17:00.199 --> 01:17:03.533
What are you gonna do?
Beat up the whole neighborhood?

01:17:03.828 --> 01:17:06.616
Break a hundred arms?
A thousand legs?

01:17:06.914 --> 01:17:09.247
It's lucky for you you're
wearing that gunnysack, dinge.

01:17:09.542 --> 01:17:11.078
Well, don't let that stop you.

01:17:11.377 --> 01:17:13.460
You keep talking, it won't.

01:17:13.754 --> 01:17:16.588
Go ahead, beat up a nun.

01:17:16.882 --> 01:17:19.374
Great public relations, you.

01:17:19.677 --> 01:17:22.294
You small-time gorilla.

01:17:35.818 --> 01:17:37.480
You looking for trouble...

01:17:37.778 --> 01:17:41.738
Break it up!

01:17:42.032 --> 01:17:44.991
Right along the barricades.
Along the barricades.

01:17:45.286 --> 01:17:50.077
Cool it! Cool it!

01:17:50.374 --> 01:17:52.536
Stay put till I call you.

01:17:52.835 --> 01:17:56.249
Break it up.
Move it.

01:17:56.547 --> 01:17:58.288
Nobody sent for the fuzz, man.

01:17:59.133 --> 01:18:02.046
We're just naturally interested
in any kind of trouble.

01:18:02.344 --> 01:18:04.836
There ain't no trouble
here, man.

01:18:05.139 --> 01:18:09.053
You've got my gilt-edged,
triple-bonded guarantee... Lieutenant.

01:18:13.022 --> 01:18:14.854
I'll settle for that.

01:18:16.650 --> 01:18:20.189
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:18:20.487 --> 01:18:22.274
Come on, man: Now cool it.
Everybody cool it.

01:18:22.573 --> 01:18:24.314
Let's have a good time.

01:18:24.617 --> 01:18:27.826
Come on. Break it up.

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:32.490
Go on, dance.
Have fun. Start the music.

01:18:39.256 --> 01:18:41.748
Um, I'd like to thank you.

01:18:42.051 --> 01:18:44.384
We help our own, Sister.

01:18:57.399 --> 01:18:59.391
Are you all right?
Yes, I'm quite all right.

01:18:59.693 --> 01:19:02.936
Sister Michelle, I'd like
all of you to make arrangements...

01:19:03.239 --> 01:19:05.231
to return to the convent.

01:19:05.532 --> 01:19:07.489
Tomorrow will be soon enough.

01:19:07.785 --> 01:19:10.027
But Mother Joseph, the worst is over.

01:19:10.329 --> 01:19:12.571
Or yet to come.

01:19:57.918 --> 01:20:01.958
Hey, Sister. Sister?

01:20:02.256 --> 01:20:04.589
How do you like what I did
to that dress you give me?

01:20:04.883 --> 01:20:07.296
I made what they call
a few alterations.

01:20:07.594 --> 01:20:10.211
And everybody said
I looked like a real lady.

01:20:10.514 --> 01:20:14.884
I mean, like...
Thanks, Sister.

01:20:31.243 --> 01:20:35.829
Sister Barbara, Bishop Finley
told us to wear our habits or else.

01:20:37.541 --> 01:20:40.375
Well...

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:43.377
I guess I've chosen or else.

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:48.508
I'm going uptown
to tell Mother Joseph.

01:20:48.802 --> 01:20:53.968
I would have told her earlier, but,
I-I didn't want to spoil the party.

01:20:56.226 --> 01:21:00.812
- Barbara!
- Sister Michelle, I am too limited as a nun.

01:21:01.106 --> 01:21:04.395
Everything in life
has limitations.

01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:08.482
I know. I know.

01:21:08.781 --> 01:21:13.492
But I want to pick my own.
I want to grow up in my own way.

01:21:18.332 --> 01:21:20.449
We'll miss you.

01:21:21.919 --> 01:21:24.127
I'll be back.

01:21:24.421 --> 01:21:28.335
I may be giving up the religious life,
but I'm not giving up the fight.

01:21:28.634 --> 01:21:33.720
I've organized a political advancement committee
right here in the neighborhood.

01:21:34.014 --> 01:21:37.598
And we have our first meeting
tomorrow morning.

01:21:37.893 --> 01:21:40.351
Look, we've scored
two victories today already.

01:21:40.646 --> 01:21:43.684
The Ajax Market
and The Banker.

01:21:43.982 --> 01:21:46.099
And now is no time to stop.

01:21:49.947 --> 01:21:53.816
You are... too much.

01:22:38.245 --> 01:22:39.952
Put that down.

01:22:40.247 --> 01:22:43.411
No. Knife make me...

01:22:43.709 --> 01:22:45.075
big man.

01:22:45.377 --> 01:22:47.960
I want to help you.

01:22:50.215 --> 01:22:53.333
Bring statue back for you.

01:22:54.761 --> 01:22:56.423
Priest want to put me in jail.

01:22:56.722 --> 01:22:59.590
Go to the police.
Give yourself up.

01:22:59.892 --> 01:23:02.100
- No go back.
- I'll explain to them.

01:23:02.394 --> 01:23:05.262
Not my friend.
No more.

01:23:05.564 --> 01:23:06.975
You lie.

01:23:07.274 --> 01:23:09.641
Make a fool of me.

01:23:09.943 --> 01:23:14.813
- No.
- Show what kind of man I am.

01:23:20.370 --> 01:23:22.612
Please!

01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:26.665
No!

01:23:28.879 --> 01:23:33.920
Julio, please.
No!

01:23:34.218 --> 01:23:35.754
Julio!

01:23:36.053 --> 01:23:37.510
No! Oh, God!

01:23:37.804 --> 01:23:42.674
It was appropriate, wasn't it,
delivering a baby on this special night?

01:23:42.976 --> 01:23:44.683
Well, I come from
a long line of people...

01:23:44.978 --> 01:23:48.972
who believe in getting married,
having kids, raising a family.

01:23:49.274 --> 01:23:51.687
Our church believes in that too.

01:23:51.985 --> 01:23:54.318
Not for nuns.

01:23:54.613 --> 01:23:58.027
Oh... please... no!

01:23:58.325 --> 01:24:00.282
Oh, please!

01:24:00.577 --> 01:24:02.443
That's Michelle.

01:24:02.746 --> 01:24:04.533
Call the police, quick.

01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:08.825
Shut up! I kill you!

01:24:23.183 --> 01:24:25.766
John, don't hurt him.

01:24:32.150 --> 01:24:33.937
Are you all right?

01:24:34.236 --> 01:24:38.071
I tried.

01:24:40.659 --> 01:24:43.402
I tried.

01:24:43.704 --> 01:24:46.617
It's okay, honey.
It's all over now.

01:24:46.915 --> 01:24:49.077
It's okay.

01:25:23.368 --> 01:25:25.906
Sometimes making a decision
can be terribly painful.

01:25:26.204 --> 01:25:29.072
I should have come to you
sooner, Mother Joseph.

01:25:29.374 --> 01:25:33.539
Well, you need time
to explore your own feelings.

01:25:33.837 --> 01:25:35.999
You've got to choose
the kind of love you want.

01:25:36.298 --> 01:25:39.962
Physical love, or the love
you can find only through prayer.

01:25:41.595 --> 01:25:44.338
From my own experience,
I can tell you...

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:46.848
that nothing is more painful
than no decision.

01:25:47.142 --> 01:25:49.008
I'm finding that out.

01:25:49.311 --> 01:25:54.978
Well, perhaps an outside stimulus will help you.
Dr. Carpenter is here.

01:26:22.219 --> 01:26:26.964
Hello, John.
Michelle.

01:26:27.265 --> 01:26:30.178
It's been a long time.

01:26:30.477 --> 01:26:33.220
A long time.
How's Julio?

01:26:33.522 --> 01:26:36.230
Father Gibbons is coming
out of the Middle Ages.

01:26:36.525 --> 01:26:39.518
He's not going to press charges.
And Julio's under psychiatric care.

01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:41.027
I'm so glad.

01:26:41.321 --> 01:26:44.735
When he gets out of the hospital,
he's still gonna need a speech therapist.

01:26:45.659 --> 01:26:47.446
You'll find someone.

01:26:52.374 --> 01:26:55.367
Look, I don't know if I'm breaking any rules
about being here or not...

01:26:55.669 --> 01:27:00.164
- Oh, of course not, John.
- Or if you have a rule against the way I feel about you.

01:27:00.465 --> 01:27:03.708
Well, the fact that I'm a nun
doesn't stop me from being a woman.

01:27:04.010 --> 01:27:07.299
And it doesn't change
the way I feel about you.

01:27:07.597 --> 01:27:09.384
On the way up here
I had it all figured out.

01:27:09.683 --> 01:27:12.050
I was just going to lay all my cards
on the table.

01:27:12.352 --> 01:27:15.720
But this place can slow you down,
you know what I mean?

01:27:17.607 --> 01:27:19.519
I wish there were an easy answer.

01:27:19.818 --> 01:27:23.186
Would you be committing a sin
if you were to leave here and get married?

01:27:24.781 --> 01:27:28.866
In marriage, you love God
through one person.

01:27:29.161 --> 01:27:32.745
As a nun, I made a commitment
to love God through all people.

01:27:33.039 --> 01:27:35.622
But this place is not a prison.
You can get a release, you know.

01:27:35.917 --> 01:27:39.752
But, in leaving...
in marriage...

01:27:40.046 --> 01:27:43.130
I'd be giving up the freedom
to dedicate myself...

01:27:43.425 --> 01:27:45.792
to people
who need me desperately.

01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:47.926
Let's try to find a way, Michelle.

01:27:50.557 --> 01:27:53.220
I thought I'd found my way...
until I met you.

01:27:53.518 --> 01:27:55.438
Things are different now,
you said that yourself.

01:27:55.687 --> 01:27:58.270
Because I love you.

01:27:58.565 --> 01:28:02.650
And no matter what I do,
I'll still love you.

01:28:02.944 --> 01:28:05.687
Even if I stay in the Order,
nothing's gonna change that.

01:28:05.989 --> 01:28:07.730
If you stay in the Order?

01:28:09.534 --> 01:28:13.278
John, I know it's not fair
not to give you an answer.

01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:15.822
But I honestly don't know if I can.

01:28:16.124 --> 01:28:17.956
Why don't you try?

01:28:18.251 --> 01:28:21.619
John, I have to go.
Please?

01:28:25.258 --> 01:28:27.796
"Believe it or not I'm still
down here on Washington Street.

01:28:28.094 --> 01:28:31.087
I'm working every day with my group,
and are we way out!"

01:28:31.389 --> 01:28:33.551
It's from Barbara.

01:28:33.850 --> 01:28:38.390
What's an "infrastructional
sphere of mechanistic behaviorism"?

01:28:40.148 --> 01:28:44.313
- You think she's a communist?
- Oh, no, no.

01:28:44.611 --> 01:28:47.354
Well, whatever it is,
she's happy with it.

01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:50.606
You seem happy too.

01:28:50.909 --> 01:28:54.698
- Peace. Sister, it's wonderful.
- So I've heard.

01:28:54.996 --> 01:29:00.367
You are never going to be able to fish
or cut bait until you see that young man again.

01:29:07.217 --> 01:29:10.210
Shall we go?
Go where?

01:29:10.512 --> 01:29:14.096
