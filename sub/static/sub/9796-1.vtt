WEBVTT

00:27.520 --> 00:30.620
We are Monsters, we are proud

00:30.720 --> 00:34.180
We are Monsters, say it loud

00:34.280 --> 00:39.060
Don't stop rocking your right to fright

00:39.160 --> 00:40.900
We are Monster High

00:41.000 --> 00:44.020
We are Monsters, we are proud

00:44.120 --> 00:46.180
We are Monsters, say it loud

00:46.280 --> 00:48.420
We are Monster High

00:48.520 --> 00:50.700
We are monsters, we are proud

00:50.800 --> 00:52.900
We are Monsters, say it loud

00:53.000 --> 00:55.526
We are Monster High

00:57.720 --> 01:02.044
Be yourself, be unique, be a monster.

01:02.160 --> 01:04.561
That's what Monster High is all about.

01:04.720 --> 01:07.929
Tomorrow's dance recital
is gonna be voltageous!

01:08.480 --> 01:10.562
It was almost summer,

01:14.320 --> 01:17.767
but school was still in session
at Monster High.

01:20.200 --> 01:24.140
Sometimes, Abbey,
I think I should go full mummy.

01:24.240 --> 01:28.484
Yeti have saying, face is beauty
when heart is beauty.

01:30.880 --> 01:35.169
Draculaura was pushing
her Vegetarian Vampires club.

01:35.680 --> 01:38.684
- Clawd! Don't put the "eat" in meat!
- What?

01:41.840 --> 01:42.841
Argh!

01:43.200 --> 01:46.522
Daughter of Dracula,
can't stand the sight of blood.

01:48.800 --> 01:52.725
Don't let Toralei get to you.
That cat should be de-clawed.

01:52.840 --> 01:55.540
Lagoona and Gil were
getting along swimmingly,

01:55.640 --> 01:58.420
even for fresh and
salt water sea-monsters.

01:58.520 --> 02:01.729
And Frankie was her usual shocking self.

02:01.920 --> 02:03.700
Literally.

02:03.800 --> 02:07.620
Oh, sorry, Clawdeen! Oh,
here, let me give you a hand.

02:07.720 --> 02:08.881
Thanks!

02:10.320 --> 02:12.049
Here! Check it!

02:13.640 --> 02:17.122
We had been best ghoul friends
for such a long time!

02:17.240 --> 02:19.420
We thought we knew each other inside out.

02:19.520 --> 02:20.700
Heads up!

02:20.800 --> 02:23.180
But I guess we didn't know everything.

02:23.280 --> 02:25.851
And, that's when the trouble started.

02:26.360 --> 02:27.725
Ghouls! Ghouls! Ghouls!

02:27.880 --> 02:30.929
We need to be fang-tastic
at this dance recital!

02:31.080 --> 02:35.449
I need scary! I need spooky! I need fun!

02:36.480 --> 02:38.767
I need a break.

02:38.960 --> 02:41.691
Who died and made Toralei boss?

02:42.040 --> 02:44.088
Headmistress Bloodgood, remember?

02:44.360 --> 02:47.011
This better be worth the extra deadit.

02:52.080 --> 02:53.081
Oof!

02:53.640 --> 02:55.740
No! No, no, no!

02:55.840 --> 02:59.003
That's scare-able! Scare-able!
It goes like this!

03:00.480 --> 03:03.700
- Isn't that what we were doing?
- Am I doing it right?

03:03.800 --> 03:06.451
It looks awful, so, yes?

03:09.760 --> 03:12.001
Hey, ghouls! Looking...

03:14.440 --> 03:15.726
Great!

03:15.840 --> 03:17.180
Lagoona, come join us!

03:17.280 --> 03:21.820
Oh, thanks! But, I mean...
I'm a swimmer not a dancer.

03:21.920 --> 03:26.020
If Lagoona wanted to dance,
she should have auditioned.

03:26.120 --> 03:29.283
Killer moves like these need practice.

03:29.400 --> 03:33.121
That's okay, ghouls,
the stage is really not my thing.

03:33.440 --> 03:36.728
Well, if you want to make yourself useful,

03:36.920 --> 03:39.810
I do need someone
to organize the wrap party.

03:39.960 --> 03:43.420
Nothing big, just decorations,
music and food for like

03:43.520 --> 03:44.885
the entire school.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.365
Oh, well...

03:47.320 --> 03:49.049
Sure. No worries.

03:49.320 --> 03:50.460
Don't mess it up!

03:50.560 --> 03:55.168
All right, ghouls, I'll see you
tomorrow for opening night!

03:59.120 --> 04:00.645
Jazz hands!

04:04.040 --> 04:07.522
- Lagoona, are you coming?
- Uh, yeah. I'll catch up.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.211
Lagoona! Are you okay?

05:11.920 --> 05:13.580
How long were you watching me?

05:13.680 --> 05:16.420
Long enough to see
that you're a fantastic dancer!

05:16.520 --> 05:18.140
- Who knew?
- Nobody.

05:18.240 --> 05:19.765
And, I want to keep it that way.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.460
That was just a dance we used
to do Down Under, but...

05:22.560 --> 05:24.500
But that's ancient history.

05:24.600 --> 05:26.420
I don't dance anymore.

05:26.520 --> 05:27.931
But why?

05:28.280 --> 05:31.489
You're great, Lagoona!
You should dance in the show tomorrow.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.728
I can't! You saw what happens.

05:33.880 --> 05:36.780
Any time I dance in front of an audience,

05:36.880 --> 05:39.660
I freeze and go belly-up.

05:39.760 --> 05:42.660
I make a face like a stuck pufferfish.

05:42.760 --> 05:46.580
Luckily, you are the last monster
who will ever see that again.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.841
Hello, everyone!

05:50.440 --> 05:51.441
Ahhh.

05:51.920 --> 05:56.042
Oh, Lagoona, don't forget to add me to
the eek-vite for tomorrow's after party!

05:56.240 --> 05:58.766
It's gonna be fang-tastic!

05:58.960 --> 06:00.291
Woo! Woo!

06:00.440 --> 06:01.680
You got it, Hoodude!

06:01.840 --> 06:02.921
Woo! Woo!

06:03.440 --> 06:06.967
You won't tell anyone
about my stage fright, right, Gil?

06:07.400 --> 06:10.768
Oh, of course not!
Your secret is safe with me.

06:11.280 --> 06:16.620
So, perfect little Lagoona freezes up
like a fish stick on stage, huh?

06:16.720 --> 06:20.769
Be a shame if someone
let that cat out of the bag!

06:41.000 --> 06:42.968
You should be out there.

06:44.440 --> 06:48.570
Sometimes monsters need
to be careful what they wish for.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.525
There it is!

07:17.240 --> 07:21.165
And some people think the best way
not to be embarrassed...

07:21.480 --> 07:23.580
Oh, this show's not over.

07:23.680 --> 07:25.489
...is to embarrass someone else.

07:30.320 --> 07:31.446
Lagoona!

07:32.680 --> 07:34.250
She's pretty terrific!

07:52.040 --> 07:53.041
Lagoona!

07:54.560 --> 07:57.848
Look! Frozen fish stick!

08:15.680 --> 08:17.523
Hey, ghouls, what's up?

08:19.240 --> 08:21.242
- Absolutely nothing is up.
- Heh, um...

08:21.400 --> 08:25.500
No! Definitely, uh, not
watching the video of you

08:25.600 --> 08:28.968
from last night on FrightTube. Nothing.

08:29.360 --> 08:30.361
What?

08:35.760 --> 08:38.740
Six billion views?

08:38.840 --> 08:41.580
I am sure that it's mostly
one or two monsters

08:41.679 --> 08:45.060
watching it three billion times each.

08:45.160 --> 08:47.322
I'm going to shut my fangs now.

08:47.440 --> 08:48.500
It gets worse.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.728
You're a monster meme.

08:57.400 --> 09:00.404
Ah! This is a nightmare. I'm sunk!

09:01.560 --> 09:02.660
Lagoona!

09:02.760 --> 09:04.364
- Give me that!
- Oh, come on!

09:04.480 --> 09:05.900
Hey! That's my phone!

09:06.000 --> 09:07.180
Give it!

09:07.280 --> 09:08.486
- Give it!
- What?

09:08.640 --> 09:09.820
Come on!

09:15.120 --> 09:16.485
Oh!

09:19.560 --> 09:20.561
Oh...

09:21.320 --> 09:23.482
This is all Toralei's fault!

09:23.800 --> 09:27.260
And after all the work I did to make
the wrap party fin-tastic.

09:27.360 --> 09:30.860
How would she like it if she felt
like the fish out of water.

09:30.960 --> 09:35.060
Well, maybe it's time she got
a taste of her own medicine.

09:35.160 --> 09:36.571
Dis-invited!

09:41.160 --> 09:42.161
Meow?

09:43.520 --> 09:45.204
Where's the party?

09:46.480 --> 09:47.811
Hello?

09:48.840 --> 09:50.365
Party monsters?

10:00.320 --> 10:01.685
Hello?

10:12.440 --> 10:16.286
Ah, well, maybe Lagoona
stuck a paper invite in my locker.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.040
Oh, come on!

10:28.040 --> 10:29.565
Pool party! Whoo!

10:30.600 --> 10:33.080
Clawd, what's up?
You're not swimming, right?

10:33.400 --> 10:36.563
Yeah, yeah, yeeeah! Wooo!

10:36.880 --> 10:38.564
Woot woot!

10:38.880 --> 10:40.780
Hey, I really like this song!

10:40.880 --> 10:44.260
Oh, this party is freaky fang-tastic, uh?

10:44.360 --> 10:46.300
I know! Oh, look.

10:46.400 --> 10:49.370
Ghoulia brought her clawsome creepcakes!

10:53.560 --> 10:55.020
Killer party.

10:55.120 --> 10:58.820
Even with the music of loudness
and the people of crowding?

10:58.920 --> 11:02.003
That's what makes a killer party, Abbey.

11:05.120 --> 11:06.770
Lagoona!

11:09.680 --> 11:11.205
Step aside, bull boy.

11:11.440 --> 11:14.762
Sorry, Toralei, I don't see
your name on the eek-vite list.

11:18.320 --> 11:20.900
Hmm, look what the cat dragged in!

11:21.000 --> 11:22.260
Herself!

11:22.360 --> 11:25.443
Hey, Toralei. Like your new look.

11:26.280 --> 11:27.770
We're glad you decided to show.

11:28.400 --> 11:31.006
Decided? I wasn't even invited.

11:31.440 --> 11:34.284
Lagoona wouldn't do that, right?

11:35.080 --> 11:38.180
Yeah, I invited Toralei all right.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.442
Then I un-invited her.

11:42.520 --> 11:44.090
Huh?

11:44.560 --> 11:48.451
How dare you un-invite me to my own party?

11:49.080 --> 11:53.020
How dare you embarrass me
in front of the entire Monsternet!

11:53.120 --> 11:54.485
It was just a joke!

11:54.960 --> 11:56.166
Jokes are funny.

11:56.360 --> 11:57.566
Well, I laughed.

12:00.320 --> 12:03.210
You should thank me for making you famous.

12:03.600 --> 12:06.180
Thank you? Now that's a joke!

12:06.280 --> 12:08.886
Yeah, six billion laughs and counting!

12:09.040 --> 12:10.041
Oh.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.580
- Kitty litter!
- Fish eyes!

12:31.680 --> 12:33.330
- Fang face!
- Sushi roll!

12:33.440 --> 12:37.060
Come on, ghouls! It's a party.
Here, have a creepcake.

12:37.160 --> 12:41.740
Maybe I'll just hog as many as I want

12:41.840 --> 12:45.049
because I only think about myself.

12:45.560 --> 12:49.485
Maybe I'll hide them all and not invite
anyone else to have some!

12:51.760 --> 12:52.740
You know what?

12:52.840 --> 12:55.420
There's only one place I can think
of that will fit all these.

12:55.520 --> 12:57.090
Yeah! And that's...

12:57.200 --> 12:59.362
- In your big mouth!
- In your big mouth!

13:06.040 --> 13:07.371
No!

13:08.280 --> 13:09.725
No...

13:33.600 --> 13:35.340
But she can't swim!

13:35.440 --> 13:36.680
Hang on!

13:45.800 --> 13:46.881
Lagoona!

13:57.600 --> 13:58.601
Ahhh.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.041
Whoa!

14:25.280 --> 14:28.170
Somehow, fighting made the pool change,

14:29.120 --> 14:30.963
like it could hear us.

14:33.120 --> 14:35.043
And, before we knew it,

14:35.680 --> 14:38.286
we were in way too deep.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.526
Oh... Where are we?

14:48.960 --> 14:52.328
More like, "What are we?"

14:54.360 --> 14:56.140
- Look at you!
- You look fin-tastic!

14:56.240 --> 14:58.380
- So do you!
- I love your fins!

14:58.480 --> 15:00.608
Who's ever heard of a catfish?

15:03.720 --> 15:05.722
I've been fishified!

15:05.840 --> 15:07.860
This is my worst nightmare!

15:07.960 --> 15:09.300
Do something, Lagoona!

15:09.400 --> 15:11.380
What am I supposed to do?

15:17.040 --> 15:19.361
Oh. Look at you! You're squishy!

15:21.240 --> 15:23.402
Wow. What are those?

15:23.720 --> 15:25.688
These are sea-mares!

15:27.360 --> 15:29.169
Hello, little friends!

15:31.000 --> 15:32.809
Aw! Sweet!

15:34.800 --> 15:37.246
I think they want us to follow.

15:42.040 --> 15:43.041
Wow!

15:56.200 --> 15:57.900
So much water.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.780
I'm getting hydrophobic!

16:00.880 --> 16:03.531
Everything is so fishy!

16:04.120 --> 16:06.660
Lagoona!

16:06.760 --> 16:09.366
Change me back right meow!

16:10.400 --> 16:13.051
Oh, Lagoona didn't do that.

16:13.480 --> 16:15.482
I did!

16:23.080 --> 16:25.765
I am Posea,

16:26.240 --> 16:28.780
daughter of Poseidon,

16:28.880 --> 16:31.140
guardian of the sea.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.460
I keep watch over all creatures

16:34.560 --> 16:38.485
of the deep, great and small!

16:39.080 --> 16:41.606
Behold... Ow!

16:42.160 --> 16:46.449
Hey! I told you guys to behave
when I'm doing my goddess thing, ugh!

16:50.920 --> 16:53.844
Hang on. You brought us down here?

16:54.200 --> 16:57.820
I brought you, Lagoona Blue!

16:57.920 --> 17:01.340
I can command the waters at my whim!

17:01.440 --> 17:04.364
Your friends, bit of an accident. My bad!

17:06.200 --> 17:08.339
Oh.

17:08.440 --> 17:10.060
Who am I kidding.

17:10.160 --> 17:12.810
I'm still in the goddess kiddie pool.

17:13.880 --> 17:17.281
Oh, what are these? They're gore-geous.

17:17.880 --> 17:21.202
Every sea creature is represented
by a plant here in my sea bed.

17:21.640 --> 17:24.689
It's how we sea-protectors,
watch over sea life.

17:25.359 --> 17:28.250
Your plant-equivalent
is called your sea lifeline.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.340
Here's Lagoona's. See?

17:30.440 --> 17:34.490
It is in grave danger!

17:34.840 --> 17:37.380
Okay, okay. Maybe not grave,

17:37.480 --> 17:40.165
but it is definitely a little wilted.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.500
Oh, bear with me, I'm new at this

17:42.600 --> 17:45.649
"helping sea creatures" thing. So...

17:46.520 --> 17:49.100
What troubles you, ghoul?

17:49.200 --> 17:53.740
The only thing troubling me is
my friends and I being fishnapped!

17:53.840 --> 17:55.500
Change us back and send us home.

17:55.600 --> 17:59.220
That is so not how sea magic works!

17:59.320 --> 18:05.327
Beneath a calm
surface lie troubled waters.

18:05.840 --> 18:10.767
You must dive deep and face your fear!

18:11.760 --> 18:14.843
Face my fear? I... What... Ugh.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.764
What are you talking about?

18:16.960 --> 18:19.540
Well, that's for me to know
and you to find out!

18:19.640 --> 18:21.961
Or at least for you to find out.

18:22.560 --> 18:27.740
Face your deepest fear
and find your way home, Lagoona!

18:27.840 --> 18:30.220
The choice is yours.

18:30.320 --> 18:34.166
Sink or swim!

18:40.280 --> 18:41.361
She's gone?

18:41.920 --> 18:45.700
We can't get home until Lagoona
fixes some freaky flaw?

18:45.800 --> 18:48.690
Which one? She has so many.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.526
What do we do now? Whoa!

18:54.440 --> 18:59.480
Well, Posea said we have to...
"Sink or swim!"

19:05.080 --> 19:07.731
I think they're trying to give us
a swimming lesson.

19:07.840 --> 19:08.841
Whoa!

19:09.160 --> 19:11.049
We sure could use one.

19:15.040 --> 19:16.140
Oh...

19:18.640 --> 19:20.210
Wait for me.

19:35.080 --> 19:37.765
I'm a lot faster than I used to be!

19:45.480 --> 19:47.289
I've got it now!

19:52.320 --> 19:53.526
Whoa!

20:06.040 --> 20:07.724
Voltageous!

20:09.960 --> 20:11.689
No, no, no, no.

20:12.240 --> 20:14.971
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

20:19.720 --> 20:20.721
Meow!

20:38.560 --> 20:42.300
This is so cool! Come on, guys, catch up!

20:42.400 --> 20:45.006
Gil, watch out!

20:50.040 --> 20:51.041
Oh, waah.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.809
Check it out, ghouls!

21:00.120 --> 21:01.690
Awesome, right?

21:02.840 --> 21:03.841
Whoo-hoo.

21:06.080 --> 21:07.660
Woah, mega-watts!

21:07.760 --> 21:08.921
Argh!

21:10.320 --> 21:13.220
Oh, sorry! Didn't see you! Cool camo.

21:13.320 --> 21:16.100
Check this out. Jazz hands!

21:16.200 --> 21:17.690
Mraow!

21:19.120 --> 21:20.860
- Oh, this is cool!
- Sweet!

21:20.960 --> 21:23.281
Oh, you guys are really
getting the fang of this!

21:27.280 --> 21:28.860
Awesome, right?

21:28.960 --> 21:30.485
Toralei approves.

21:31.200 --> 21:34.540
Hold your seahorses! Um...

21:34.640 --> 21:36.100
Where do we go from here?

21:42.360 --> 21:44.806
Look at all that open water.

21:45.560 --> 21:47.562
Hmm, I have a sinking feeling about this,

21:47.960 --> 21:51.487
but Posea said I need to face my fear.

21:56.280 --> 22:00.080
And, so, we set out into the vast ocean.

22:08.240 --> 22:10.460
We didn't know what we were looking for.

22:10.560 --> 22:13.980
We just knew we had to help
Lagoona face her fear,

22:14.080 --> 22:16.287
however that was gonna happen.

22:26.440 --> 22:27.441
What?

22:27.920 --> 22:28.921
Is that...

22:30.440 --> 22:32.647
Why does that look so familiar?

22:49.400 --> 22:51.801
Whoa, look at the lights!

22:58.120 --> 22:59.121
Ah...

22:59.240 --> 23:00.605
Beautiful!

24:22.600 --> 24:23.647
Kala.

24:25.160 --> 24:28.580
Lagoona! It's been forever.

24:28.680 --> 24:32.810
Like the new look,
beats your old "two legger" style.

24:34.520 --> 24:36.761
Ladies and fishermen,

24:37.120 --> 24:39.600
we have a special guest tonight.

24:40.080 --> 24:42.208
Would you like to meet her?

24:46.080 --> 24:50.369
Please, welcome my old fin
and dancing partner,

24:50.560 --> 24:52.562
Lagoona Blue!

25:08.520 --> 25:10.204
Lagoona!

25:10.320 --> 25:11.924
Lagoona!

25:14.680 --> 25:17.340
Lagoona! Lagoona, it's a full house!

25:17.440 --> 25:19.260
Kala, look!

25:19.360 --> 25:21.060
My entire family came!

25:21.160 --> 25:24.130
- There she is! Break a fin!
- That's our ghoul!

25:25.560 --> 25:27.940
My dad took off work
special just to be here.

25:28.040 --> 25:30.168
We're having a big party afterwards.

25:30.360 --> 25:31.420
Can I come?

25:31.520 --> 25:33.682
Aren't you going to be with your family?

25:33.800 --> 25:35.140
Where are they sitting?

25:35.240 --> 25:36.820
- Over there somewhere.
- Where?

25:36.920 --> 25:38.740
- There.
- I don't see them.

25:38.840 --> 25:42.860
Hey, maybe, after the show,
my family and your family could...

25:42.960 --> 25:44.530
They're not coming, okay?

25:44.800 --> 25:47.140
Only a baby would need their daddy here.

25:47.240 --> 25:49.700
Kala! Why are you being so mean?

25:49.800 --> 25:51.860
Why do you have to be little miss perfect?

25:51.960 --> 25:55.580
With your perfect dance moves
and perfect looks and perfect family!

25:55.680 --> 25:57.460
You don't know what it's like
to be made fun of.

25:57.560 --> 25:58.740
I don't understand!

25:58.840 --> 26:02.620
Scalies and gentlefins, please welcome
our next dance performance,

26:02.720 --> 26:08.124
the Great Scarrier Reef's own,
Lagoona Blue and Kala Mer'ri!

26:14.480 --> 26:17.563
Quit clowning around Lagoona.

26:17.880 --> 26:20.042
You're embarrassing us!

26:26.920 --> 26:28.620
- Oh, not again.
- Lagoona!

26:28.720 --> 26:31.380
Poor Lagoona. Is she okay?

26:31.480 --> 26:33.300
- No, no, no, no, no, Pearl!
- Peri.

26:33.400 --> 26:34.900
She's frozen!

26:35.000 --> 26:37.002
Just like old times.

26:37.480 --> 26:39.540
- No, it's happening again.
- My gosh!

26:39.640 --> 26:41.220
Lagoona!

26:46.840 --> 26:48.140
Ladies and gentlemen,

26:48.240 --> 26:50.460
thank you for attending
tonight's performance.

26:50.560 --> 26:54.645
Be sure to join us for the upcoming
Siren of the Sea competition.

26:59.120 --> 27:01.202
Who was that poison pufferfish?

27:01.360 --> 27:04.940
That's Kala and her ghoul friends,
Pearl and Peri.

27:05.040 --> 27:07.441
Someone like that has ghoul friends?

27:07.560 --> 27:09.260
Yeah, I'm not one of them.

27:09.360 --> 27:11.620
So, what was Kala doing?

27:11.720 --> 27:13.180
Some sort of dance?

27:13.280 --> 27:16.443
Yeah, it's a classic aquatic
dance we do down here.

27:17.280 --> 27:19.620
I used to love performing it.

27:19.720 --> 27:23.260
Kala is a big part of why I left
the Great Scarrier Reef,

27:23.360 --> 27:24.860
and came to Monster High.

27:24.960 --> 27:26.420
What happened?

27:26.520 --> 27:28.060
It's ancient history.

27:28.160 --> 27:31.448
What matters now is getting
everything back to normal.

27:32.080 --> 27:35.926
Tomorrow, we'll find Posea
and make her send us back.

27:36.120 --> 27:39.740
Finally, some monster makes sense!

27:39.840 --> 27:42.140
Watch it, I'm swimming here.

27:43.920 --> 27:46.540
So, what do you think of my hometown?

27:48.440 --> 27:53.321
We all agreed, the Great
Scarrier Reef was breathtaking,

27:54.800 --> 27:56.768
and not just because we had gills now.

27:57.080 --> 28:00.926
It's a spectacular underwater culture!

28:04.240 --> 28:07.500
While we're down here,
we just gotta drop in on my family.

28:07.600 --> 28:09.648
They'll be so surprised to see me!

28:09.840 --> 28:11.140
Come on, Gil!

28:11.240 --> 28:13.447
- Ready to meet my whole family?
- Um...

28:13.680 --> 28:15.284
Yay. Oh!

28:29.440 --> 28:31.488
Hi, everyone! Surprise!

28:33.200 --> 28:36.044
Look at you! You're so skinny. Come here.

28:36.400 --> 28:39.244
- Everyone, this is my dad!
- How are you, Mr. Blue?

28:39.360 --> 28:41.840
It's so great to meet
the rest of the Blue family.

28:42.640 --> 28:46.860
Something's different, Lagoona.
Let me guess. New haircut?

28:46.960 --> 28:49.361
Dad, I have a tail!

28:49.960 --> 28:53.965
Ah! You crazy kids these days
and your fads. Why do you do it?

28:54.520 --> 28:55.900
How do you do it?

28:56.000 --> 28:57.365
I don't know!

28:57.520 --> 28:58.760
Well, come on in everyone...

28:58.880 --> 29:02.407
So we spent our first night
in the Great Scarrier Reef.

29:07.480 --> 29:09.140
She looked like that, right?

29:09.240 --> 29:12.220
Totally. You could've been
an actress, too, Kala.

29:12.320 --> 29:15.180
I mean, you just have so many talents.

29:15.280 --> 29:16.980
Give it a rest, Pearl!

29:17.080 --> 29:19.380
Kala knows you worship
the ground she floats on.

29:19.480 --> 29:23.260
You're just jealous, Peri,
because I'm Kala's BFF,

29:23.360 --> 29:25.540
best fish forever!

29:25.640 --> 29:27.220
Ah! You have such a big head sometimes!

29:27.320 --> 29:28.740
At least, mine's not an airhead!

29:28.840 --> 29:30.580
- Who are you calling an airhead?
- You!

29:30.680 --> 29:32.801
- You! I'm calling you an airhead!
- Are you even hearing yourself?

29:33.600 --> 29:35.011
Will you two put a hook in it?

29:36.360 --> 29:38.283
I'm trying to spy.

29:45.920 --> 29:47.684
He's funny looking.

29:49.480 --> 29:51.084
Wanna play ball?

29:53.160 --> 29:54.366
Aw.

29:55.640 --> 29:59.042
Lagoona, your mom is going
to be sad she missed you all,

29:59.160 --> 30:02.767
but she's visiting your Aunt Bay
all weekend. Ah, I know.

30:03.280 --> 30:04.327
Ah, that's too bad.

30:07.040 --> 30:09.850
Stop it, you little tadpoles!
Not so rough!

30:11.240 --> 30:12.605
I'm okay!

30:13.440 --> 30:14.460
Uh, I think.

30:14.560 --> 30:16.483
You're so fun, Gil!

30:19.480 --> 30:20.620
Um...

30:20.720 --> 30:22.563
I missed you, Lagoona.

30:22.920 --> 30:25.300
I missed you too, Kelpie!

30:25.400 --> 30:28.180
But something was wrong with Lagoona.

30:28.280 --> 30:29.860
We could all see it.

30:29.960 --> 30:32.167
Why did Posea bring her here?

30:48.120 --> 30:51.203
Hmm. Another Kraken sighting.

30:51.880 --> 30:53.500
Oh, no, what's a Kraken?

30:53.600 --> 30:54.860
Oh, you don't know?

30:54.960 --> 30:56.724
Sit down, sit down, sit down!

30:56.920 --> 31:02.290
It's a horrific beast that swims up
at night to terrorize schools of fish!

31:02.480 --> 31:05.460
With its big, long, sucking tentacles,

31:05.560 --> 31:09.121
and slime for as far as the eye can see!

31:09.280 --> 31:13.180
He lives in the deepest dark
over the edge of town.

31:13.280 --> 31:15.700
They say nobody
who has looked the horrible,

31:15.800 --> 31:19.361
stinking Kraken in the eye
has lived to tell the tale!

31:19.760 --> 31:22.700
Don't ask me how I
know this, but it's true!

31:22.800 --> 31:26.020
Dad, stop scaring my friends.

31:26.120 --> 31:28.940
Look, we need to focus on finding Posea,

31:29.040 --> 31:32.300
so we can get our legs
and get back to Monster High!

31:32.400 --> 31:36.883
But, Lagoona, Posea said we can't
go back until you face your fear.

31:37.120 --> 31:40.010
What fear? I don't have any...

31:41.720 --> 31:43.484
Fine!

31:44.600 --> 31:48.241
So, I have terrible stage fright.

31:49.640 --> 31:52.980
Hey! What if I've already done it?

31:53.080 --> 31:56.050
I mean, I was just onstage, briefly!

31:56.480 --> 31:57.845
Uh, I don't know...

31:58.000 --> 31:59.660
That's it, I'm sure I'm done.

31:59.760 --> 32:01.580
We just need to find Posea and tell her!

32:01.680 --> 32:04.380
Lagoona, can I hang out with you today?

32:04.480 --> 32:06.244
No, not today, Kelpie.

32:06.360 --> 32:08.300
The ghouls and I
have something important to do.

32:08.400 --> 32:11.420
But you're not leaving, leaving, are you?

32:11.520 --> 32:14.205
No, no, no, we'll talk about it later.

32:23.840 --> 32:26.260
Ah! "Swimmy Golf." That looks fun!

32:26.360 --> 32:29.820
No time for games, ghouls!
We need to find Posea today.

32:29.920 --> 32:31.780
Mr. B was right.

32:31.880 --> 32:37.420
This does look like where a horrible,
stinking beast would live. Ugh!

32:37.520 --> 32:39.660
Let's just hope it stays home.

32:39.760 --> 32:41.140
Creepy.

32:41.240 --> 32:44.130
I mean, who's to say it won't just pop up.

32:46.640 --> 32:49.928
You ghouls have really found your sea-legs

32:50.200 --> 32:52.248
or, you know, sea-tails.

32:52.880 --> 32:57.204
Even the Kraken would be impressed,
and he is mostly sea-legs.

32:57.360 --> 32:58.580
Tentacles, technically.

32:58.680 --> 33:01.047
Okay, Posea, I did it.

33:01.400 --> 33:03.540
I faced my fear. Just like you asked.

33:03.640 --> 33:04.641
Done-zo.

33:04.920 --> 33:06.763
Really? That was fast.

33:07.120 --> 33:08.645
Too fast.

33:09.160 --> 33:11.340
Suspiciously fast.

33:11.440 --> 33:14.300
No, no, not too fast.
Exactly the right speed.

33:14.400 --> 33:15.460
Home and legs now, please.

33:15.560 --> 33:16.820
Ah-ah-ah.

33:16.920 --> 33:19.400
Let's check your sea lifeline.

33:20.240 --> 33:21.446
Hmm.

33:21.560 --> 33:23.140
Sorry, Lagoona.

33:23.240 --> 33:25.580
But I'm sure I faced it! I know I did!

33:25.680 --> 33:28.060
Not according to Wilty McFlower here.

33:28.160 --> 33:29.140
But...

33:29.240 --> 33:31.447
Please, Posea! It's not fair.

33:31.760 --> 33:35.180
I told you.
That's not how sea magic works.

33:35.280 --> 33:39.900
Face your deepest fear
and find your way home.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.180
I don't know sea magic!

33:42.280 --> 33:44.220
How am I supposed to know
when I've faced it?

33:44.320 --> 33:46.900
Have patience, Lagoona Blue.

33:47.000 --> 33:53.121
Go with the flow and let the answers
wash over you like a wave.

34:00.600 --> 34:03.365
Uh, anyone up for some Swimmy Golf?

34:09.679 --> 34:10.806
Oh, yeah!

34:13.520 --> 34:16.922
The answers will wash over me?
Go with the flow?

34:17.360 --> 34:19.500
Ah, what does that even mean?

34:19.600 --> 34:22.540
Maybe it means,
you'll know it when you sea it.

34:22.639 --> 34:24.580
Sea it?

34:24.679 --> 34:27.809
'Cause we're in the sea.
Okay, you don't see it.

34:34.080 --> 34:35.940
Well, well, well.

34:36.040 --> 34:39.283
I thought you would have slunk back
to Monster High by now.

34:39.440 --> 34:42.219
Don't take the bait, Lagoona.
She's just trolling you.

34:42.320 --> 34:43.300
What do you want?

34:43.400 --> 34:46.659
Oh, I wanted to see if
you ghouls have the guts

34:46.760 --> 34:50.844
to compete in the Siren of the Sea
talent show tomorrow night.

34:51.520 --> 34:53.841
Oh! The best aqua dancers will be there!

34:54.040 --> 34:56.042
- This is what Posea meant!
- Mmm-hmm.

34:56.159 --> 34:57.161
Oh...

34:57.320 --> 35:00.260
I hear there's an opening
in the comedy category, Lagoona.

35:00.360 --> 35:03.820
I'm not taking the bait, Kala.
You'll have to laugh at something else.

35:03.920 --> 35:06.207
Oh, my guppy, Kala!

35:07.480 --> 35:09.940
I'm like, I'm like your biggest fan ever!

35:10.040 --> 35:12.380
Kelpie! You're not supposed to be here!

35:12.480 --> 35:14.847
I'm learning to dance just like you!

35:16.920 --> 35:18.220
Aw.

35:18.320 --> 35:20.700
Aren't you the cutest little minnow?

35:20.800 --> 35:24.780
One day you're going to grow up
and be just like me.

35:24.880 --> 35:26.620
Really?

35:26.720 --> 35:28.404
If you're lucky.

35:28.560 --> 35:29.780
Gee.

35:29.880 --> 35:33.620
I bet you'd sure like to see
your big sister aqua dance

35:33.720 --> 35:36.405
in the Siren of the Sea competition.

35:36.760 --> 35:38.171
I'm doing it.

35:38.280 --> 35:41.250
Lagoona! I wanna see you dance!

35:41.440 --> 35:43.940
Pretty, pretty, pretty please,
with oyster sauce on top?

35:44.040 --> 35:47.442
Kelpie, it's... Complicated.

35:47.560 --> 35:51.485
Is it? Or are you just
afraid to take me on?

35:53.120 --> 35:54.201
I...

35:59.680 --> 36:01.921
I'll do it. I'll dance.

36:02.960 --> 36:06.980
Fin-tastic! I can't wait to see
what you come up with.

36:08.400 --> 36:11.244
Or, should I say, belly up with?

36:13.160 --> 36:16.846
Lagoona, are you okay?
You're looking a little shaky.

36:17.200 --> 36:19.328
I think I'm going to be seasick.

36:19.440 --> 36:21.340
Me, too!

36:21.440 --> 36:23.900
Ghouls, what is that?

36:24.000 --> 36:25.331
Earthquake?

36:25.600 --> 36:27.443
We should get out of here!

36:40.120 --> 36:41.540
It seemed obvious.

36:41.640 --> 36:44.610
Lagoona needed to face
her scare-able stage fright,

36:44.720 --> 36:47.326
and we were just the ghouls to help.

36:48.120 --> 36:50.180
So, what kind of dance
are you going to do, Lagoona?

36:50.280 --> 36:51.441
I don't know.

36:51.560 --> 36:54.291
- Got any ideas, little fish?
- Oh, yeah!

36:54.600 --> 36:57.763
How about like this, and then like this!

36:58.800 --> 37:00.723
And then... Woosh.

37:01.320 --> 37:03.402
They are excellent suggestions!

37:03.600 --> 37:06.001
Come on. Learn from the Meow-ster.

37:06.200 --> 37:07.260
Okay.

37:07.360 --> 37:08.646
Trust me.

37:09.920 --> 37:12.321
Now, fright, six, seven, eight.

37:17.600 --> 37:18.931
- Sorry!
- Ah!

37:19.600 --> 37:20.601
Argh!

37:25.200 --> 37:27.820
They're terrible! I love it!

37:27.920 --> 37:30.980
Uh, well, maybe we could
help them do better?

37:31.080 --> 37:32.060
Why?

37:32.160 --> 37:34.780
They're flopping perfectly on their own!

37:34.880 --> 37:37.008
Shut your gills. I'm watching!

37:41.200 --> 37:43.940
Oh, can't you see? Kala is a bully!

37:44.040 --> 37:46.860
What are you saying, Kala is two-faced?

37:46.960 --> 37:49.964
You've got to get your head
out of the clouds and back in the water!

37:50.080 --> 37:52.260
Well, I could quite easily
if your head wasn't stuck to mine!

37:52.360 --> 37:53.540
Your head is bigger than mine!

37:53.640 --> 37:54.940
It's the same sized head as yours.
We're twins!

37:55.040 --> 37:56.644
Will you two clam up?

37:58.520 --> 38:01.251
Okay, you may all need a little more work.

38:01.560 --> 38:03.608
- Kelpie, what do you think?
- Um...

38:04.560 --> 38:07.100
- Your hair looks good?
- Yeah.

38:07.200 --> 38:08.420
Thanks, Kelpie.

38:08.520 --> 38:10.249
Maybe we should take five.

38:10.480 --> 38:12.980
Yeah, 500 years.

38:14.240 --> 38:16.860
Oh, hey, why don't I
record this run through?

38:16.960 --> 38:19.725
Great idea! We can see where we need work.

38:19.880 --> 38:22.700
No! No phones! No recording!

38:22.800 --> 38:25.940
Oh, Lagoona, I'm so sorry!
I didn't even think!

38:26.040 --> 38:29.442
Frankie would never embarrass you!
She's your friend.

38:29.600 --> 38:31.170
We're all your friends.

38:32.560 --> 38:33.891
Sometimes.

38:34.240 --> 38:35.580
I'm sorry.

38:35.680 --> 38:37.300
I'm so sorry.

38:37.400 --> 38:40.165
I just... I just don't know if I can...

38:43.920 --> 38:46.082
No jumping on Gil right now.

39:12.720 --> 39:16.820
My sister and Kala would flip
if they knew I were doing this,

39:16.920 --> 39:18.684
but I can't take it anymore.

39:19.160 --> 39:21.925
They're mean to you, and it is wrong.

39:22.560 --> 39:23.561
Shh...

39:25.080 --> 39:29.740
Okay, I want to tell you why Kala
is the way she is, so fearless.

39:29.840 --> 39:32.969
Kala goes down to the Deepest Dark.

39:33.240 --> 39:35.180
The Deepest Dark?

39:35.280 --> 39:39.365
Yes, and the Darkest Deep! Shh, shh, shh.

39:39.480 --> 39:44.060
No. Weekly, when every fish
is at Sunday dinner, she sneaks down.

39:44.160 --> 39:45.660
I've seen her do it!

39:45.760 --> 39:48.420
She faces the ultimate fear.

39:48.520 --> 39:50.522
The ultimate fear?

39:51.240 --> 39:52.700
The Kraken!

39:52.800 --> 39:54.860
Shh, shh, shh, ah.

39:54.960 --> 39:59.180
Legend has it that if you look
the Kraken dead in the eye and survive.

39:59.280 --> 40:02.921
Then nothing will ever
make you afraid again.

40:03.480 --> 40:05.369
Ever again?

40:05.480 --> 40:07.340
Yes, I just said that. Ever again.

40:07.440 --> 40:08.780
Why are you telling me this?

40:08.880 --> 40:12.900
Well, Kala swims around
like she owns the place.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.764
She never lets us take center stage.

40:14.880 --> 40:17.087
It's always the Kala,
Kala, Kala, Kala show.

40:17.200 --> 40:20.940
Mostly, I am sick of her
pushing my sister around.

40:23.280 --> 40:25.567
I've said too much already.
I gotta go, bye!

40:25.760 --> 40:27.364
Thank you, Peri.

40:31.360 --> 40:35.126
So, to face my fear,
I have to look the Kraken

40:36.440 --> 40:37.851
in the eye.

40:40.360 --> 40:41.805
Well?

40:42.320 --> 40:43.731
Did she fall for it?

40:44.680 --> 40:46.762
Hook, line and sinker.

40:48.080 --> 40:52.260
Just what... Pearl,
you were pretending to be asleep?

40:52.360 --> 40:53.964
Yeah.

40:54.120 --> 40:56.964
Kala warned me you were going
softer than a sand bank.

40:57.400 --> 41:00.165
- She knew you'd try something like this.
- Aw!

41:01.240 --> 41:03.641
Poor, predictable Peri.

41:04.120 --> 41:07.540
Once Lagoona gets a look at my...
At the Kraken,

41:07.640 --> 41:11.201
she'll wobble like a bowl of jellyfish.

41:14.760 --> 41:17.820
Okay, so to face your fear,

41:17.920 --> 41:21.260
you have to seek out the most
super insanely dangerous creature

41:21.360 --> 41:23.460
in the entire Great Scarrier Reef.

41:23.560 --> 41:25.180
It's way too dangerous.

41:25.280 --> 41:26.540
Scary dangerous!

41:26.640 --> 41:28.140
Beyond dangerous.

41:28.240 --> 41:29.571
For once, I agree.

41:29.960 --> 41:32.260
Relax, ghouls. Lagoona's not crazy.

41:32.360 --> 41:34.567
It's not like we're going to do it.

41:35.240 --> 41:36.241
Right?

41:36.400 --> 41:37.925
Lagoona?

41:38.240 --> 41:40.380
We're not going to go.

41:40.480 --> 41:41.766
That's it then.

41:41.920 --> 41:43.046
Good.

41:49.240 --> 41:53.643
I am the disgusting, slimy Kraken!

41:55.920 --> 41:57.729
Do you wanna see this?

41:58.600 --> 42:00.300
- What do you think?
- Kelpie, yes.

42:00.400 --> 42:04.041
- Looks awesome.
- That looks scrumptious, Mr. Blue!

42:13.440 --> 42:15.500
It seemed so crazy.

42:15.600 --> 42:19.082
How could looking a Kraken in the eye
fix Lagoona's stage fright?

42:26.480 --> 42:28.660
Where do you think you're going?

42:28.760 --> 42:30.940
I'm going to face that Kraken.

42:31.040 --> 42:34.380
Look, I understand if you ghouls
don't want to come with,

42:34.480 --> 42:36.528
but this is something I have to do.

42:37.280 --> 42:41.046
I ran away from my stage fright
when I was just a tadpole,

42:41.160 --> 42:43.860
but I couldn't escape,
even at Monster High.

42:43.960 --> 42:48.045
I keep trying to run from it,
and it just keeps finding me.

42:48.360 --> 42:51.648
It's time for me to get rid of it
once and for all,

42:51.960 --> 42:55.380
even if it means
staring a huge, slimy monster

42:55.480 --> 42:58.740
right in his gelatinous, disgusting eye!

42:58.840 --> 43:01.320
- Then you aren't going alone.
- That's right!

43:01.440 --> 43:02.851
Are you serious?

43:03.800 --> 43:06.167
Do you hear that?

43:10.840 --> 43:12.490
We're going to see the Kraken.

43:19.840 --> 43:22.446
Five more minutes, Dad.

43:24.840 --> 43:26.365
Oh!

43:27.400 --> 43:29.084
It's you guys!

43:29.640 --> 43:33.122
Posea, can you help us
get down to the Deepest Dark?

43:33.360 --> 43:36.443
Uh, you do know what's down there, right?

43:37.960 --> 43:41.460
In the Deepest Dark resides the one

43:41.560 --> 43:44.420
whose tentacles can turn the tides...

43:44.520 --> 43:47.524
Yeah, got it, the Kraken.
Trust me, we know.

43:48.880 --> 43:52.043
Once I face the Kraken,
the scariest thing ever,

43:52.680 --> 43:54.660
I'll get over my stage fright.

43:54.760 --> 43:56.444
I'll have faced my fear.

43:56.560 --> 43:58.540
Oh, I see.

43:58.640 --> 44:03.540
But just remember,
things aren't always what they seem.

44:03.640 --> 44:04.641
Hmm.

44:06.000 --> 44:09.447
Sea lights may illuminate your way.

44:14.960 --> 44:20.524
But only seeing with your heart
will bring you home.

44:23.320 --> 44:24.810
Ready ghouls?

44:25.200 --> 44:26.980
My mom always used to say,

44:27.080 --> 44:31.051
"If all of your friends jumped off
of a cliff, would you jump, too?"

44:33.600 --> 44:35.250
Sorry, Mom!

44:54.160 --> 44:56.049
We've hit rock bottom.

45:02.520 --> 45:05.285
I'm scared! I can't see!

45:05.800 --> 45:08.724
It's okay, Draculaura. I have your hand.

45:09.440 --> 45:11.340
Oh! That's not my hand!

45:11.440 --> 45:14.100
- Clawdeen's hand?
- Uh-uh.

45:14.200 --> 45:16.700
- Toralei's?
- Not mine.

45:16.800 --> 45:18.802
Then whose hand...

45:51.280 --> 45:52.281
Ah...

45:57.760 --> 45:59.171
Wow.

46:00.840 --> 46:04.367
Ghouls, there is something here.

46:06.880 --> 46:09.884
It sort of looks like Kala.

46:10.560 --> 46:11.766
Weird.

46:17.200 --> 46:18.690
Look at that.

46:40.280 --> 46:42.886
I thought being a fish was bad,

46:43.160 --> 46:46.687
but being fish food would be way worse!

46:52.400 --> 46:54.641
Lagoona, are you sure?

46:55.320 --> 46:57.402
Yeah, we should turn back.

46:58.160 --> 46:59.969
You ghouls are right.

47:00.080 --> 47:01.620
You should turn back.

47:01.720 --> 47:03.484
- Forgive me.
- Lagoona!

47:05.960 --> 47:07.769
No more belly up!

47:08.320 --> 47:09.367
- No!
- Lagoona!

47:24.640 --> 47:26.660
You ghouls thinking what I'm thinking?

47:26.760 --> 47:31.004
That we should head back up
to the Great Scarrier Reef for some sushi?

47:31.440 --> 47:33.329
Fine, we should help her.

47:34.800 --> 47:36.450
Let's get Kraken!

47:37.400 --> 47:39.448
Really? No? Okay.

47:56.360 --> 47:57.964
Not clawsome!

48:01.240 --> 48:02.810
You ghouls followed me?

48:02.960 --> 48:05.340
Even if this is stupid...

48:05.440 --> 48:07.204
Crazy super dangerous...

48:07.320 --> 48:09.860
Or stupid crazy
with an extra side of crazy...

48:09.960 --> 48:12.460
We'll never, ever let you do it alone.

48:12.560 --> 48:13.891
All right!

48:14.160 --> 48:15.571
Let's do it!

48:25.520 --> 48:27.329
That's how you do it!

48:41.000 --> 48:45.483
This must be where the Kraken keeps
his victims to devour them later.

48:52.160 --> 48:54.288
I don't get it. This...

48:54.520 --> 48:55.521
Hmm.

49:01.480 --> 49:03.721
- Hey, I like those curtains!
- Ah!

49:08.680 --> 49:09.841
Aw.

49:14.960 --> 49:16.405
Okay, Lagoona Blue.

49:16.560 --> 49:18.050
You can do this, ghoul.

49:18.520 --> 49:20.980
You can look the Kraken in the eye.

49:21.080 --> 49:22.620
Hello, Mr. Kraken!

49:22.720 --> 49:26.060
Are you looking at me?

49:26.160 --> 49:30.100
You must be 'cause I don't see
anyone else around here.

49:31.960 --> 49:35.567
That's no mirror!

49:36.520 --> 49:38.124
That's...

49:39.400 --> 49:41.084
The Kraken!

49:50.880 --> 49:53.247
Swim, ghouls, swim!

49:55.240 --> 49:57.620
A word of advice to all
you ghouls out there.

49:57.720 --> 50:01.100
If you're ever thinking about
looking a Kraken in the eye,

50:01.200 --> 50:02.247
don't.

50:29.120 --> 50:32.488
- Lagoona, you did it!
- I did.

50:33.160 --> 50:35.700
I did it! I really did it!

50:35.800 --> 50:37.220
Thanks to you guys.

50:37.320 --> 50:40.020
- Well, how do you feel?
- I don't know.

50:40.120 --> 50:42.441
The same? Different?

50:42.560 --> 50:46.565
So, you think you're ready to take on
Kala at the Siren of the Sea?

50:46.960 --> 50:49.691
Well, there's only one way to find out.

51:03.640 --> 51:05.688
Is Lagoona's stage fright cured?

51:05.800 --> 51:07.882
- Do you really care?
- Yes.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.220
And, not just because I wanna win.

51:10.320 --> 51:13.180
You really do feel bad
about what you did to Lagoona.

51:13.280 --> 51:14.500
I didn't say that.

51:14.600 --> 51:18.540
Who knew that turning you into a fish
would make you less catty?

51:18.640 --> 51:19.940
Oh!

51:22.480 --> 51:25.100
- Lagoona, I'm so proud of you!
- Hey!

51:25.200 --> 51:27.407
But I haven't done anything yet!

51:27.520 --> 51:29.100
Ah! You're getting on stage again.

51:29.200 --> 51:30.980
You've already won in my book.

51:31.080 --> 51:33.020
- Mine, too.
- Mine, three!

51:33.120 --> 51:36.169
Lagoona, I wanna be brave like you.

51:36.880 --> 51:38.086
Hmm.

51:38.360 --> 51:40.420
- Good luck, Lagoona!
- Bye, Lagoona!

51:40.520 --> 51:41.567
Yeah.

51:42.560 --> 51:44.860
I'd ask you why you aren't warming up,

51:44.960 --> 51:47.361
but I guess you're
getting ready to freeze!

51:47.640 --> 51:51.087
You know, most monsters
would just say, "Break a fin."

51:51.520 --> 51:54.140
Oh! By the way, how'd the field trip go?

51:54.240 --> 51:58.131
- Was it deeply relaxing?
- Not exact...

51:58.680 --> 52:02.127
Wait a second. How'd you know about that?

52:02.800 --> 52:05.420
No! I swear I didn't know it was a trap!

52:05.520 --> 52:07.329
They got in my head!

52:07.440 --> 52:08.566
Wait.

52:08.720 --> 52:09.940
You tricked me?

52:10.040 --> 52:12.660
Were you terrified?

52:12.760 --> 52:13.820
I'm sure!

52:13.920 --> 52:18.050
As everyone likes to remind us,
he's quite hideous.

52:18.400 --> 52:20.860
But, I faced my fear.

52:20.960 --> 52:25.420
So sorry, there's no magic
in that Kraken's eye.

52:25.520 --> 52:28.500
There's nothing in
that eye but a good joke.

52:28.600 --> 52:32.380
You're still the same belly-upping fish
you've always been.

52:32.480 --> 52:33.500
Peri! Pearl!

52:33.600 --> 52:36.410
Stop being such sea sponges and let's go!

52:40.400 --> 52:42.084
It was all a joke.

52:42.440 --> 52:44.820
Lagoona, it's going to be okay.

52:44.920 --> 52:47.605
- Fang-solutely.
- We have your back.

52:48.320 --> 52:50.300
So what if there's no magic?

52:50.400 --> 52:52.971
You were brave enough to face a Kraken!

52:53.080 --> 52:55.820
What's a little dance show after that?

52:55.920 --> 52:57.081
Ready?

52:59.160 --> 53:01.128
And, the next contestants,

53:01.240 --> 53:04.860
Lagoona Blue and the Monster
High dance team!

53:04.960 --> 53:07.180
Lagoona Blue...

54:00.000 --> 54:01.331
You can do it, Lagoona.

54:01.560 --> 54:03.130
I know you can.

54:14.840 --> 54:16.171
Oh, no.

54:17.520 --> 54:20.842
Look! Frozen fish stick!

54:29.920 --> 54:31.001
Hey.

54:31.200 --> 54:32.460
Excuse me.

54:32.560 --> 54:33.800
Stop it.

54:34.200 --> 54:35.220
Quiet.

54:35.320 --> 54:36.980
Everybody, quiet!

54:37.080 --> 54:38.260
You know what?

54:38.360 --> 54:42.420
Out of every fish here, I've actually
seen this ghoul dance.

54:42.520 --> 54:44.443
And, she's fin-tastic.

54:44.680 --> 54:46.780
You don't even know
what you're missing out on.

54:46.880 --> 54:50.202
Lagoona wanted to conquer her fear
and come dance for you again,

54:50.520 --> 54:55.260
so she did the most courageous thing
I've ever seen any fish do.

54:55.360 --> 54:58.420
She went to the Dark and faced the Kraken,

54:58.520 --> 55:02.100
the horrible and disgusting
beast of the Deep.

55:04.400 --> 55:05.500
Grr!

55:05.600 --> 55:07.940
Then she came up here and faced you all.

55:08.040 --> 55:11.300
Even though she was scared, even though
she knew there was a chance

55:11.400 --> 55:15.420
she'd go belly up,
she swam out on stage and tried.

55:15.520 --> 55:16.500
Yes!

55:16.600 --> 55:20.940
And that's more beautiful than any dance
you're going to see here tonight.

55:21.040 --> 55:25.780
So maybe sometime you should try
clapping instead of laughing,

55:25.880 --> 55:28.531
and you might see
something beautiful, too.

55:31.760 --> 55:35.287
Besides, I'm the only one
who gets to be mean to Lagoona.

55:36.320 --> 55:38.209
Let's get out of here.

55:38.600 --> 55:43.180
For our next competitor,
I give you Kala Mer'ri and her crew.

55:43.280 --> 55:45.248
Lagoona Blue! Lagoona Blue!

55:45.640 --> 55:46.660
What?

55:46.760 --> 55:50.128
Hey! I'm queen of the reef. She's a fluke!

55:50.280 --> 55:53.100
This is my time! I'm ready to dance!

55:53.200 --> 55:55.441
Calm down. We are leaving right now.

55:55.760 --> 55:58.491
Don't talk to me! You're not my father!

55:58.640 --> 56:01.291
Lagoona Blue! Lagoona Blue!

56:01.400 --> 56:04.244
No! It's my turn!

56:04.560 --> 56:05.980
You're trying to keep me out!

56:06.080 --> 56:08.367
You're all trying to keep me out!

56:08.560 --> 56:11.460
Kala! No one's trying to keep you out!

56:13.840 --> 56:15.729
What is she doing?

56:15.960 --> 56:19.180
- I don't know!
- Nothing good, I bet!

56:26.760 --> 56:27.700
Crikey!

56:27.800 --> 56:30.326
It's the Kraken! I'm out of here.

56:36.720 --> 56:38.131
Swim!

56:42.640 --> 56:44.060
I've got to get out of here!

56:44.160 --> 56:45.810
Come on. Let's get out of here.

57:06.640 --> 57:08.608
Kala, help! Kala!

57:08.760 --> 57:12.660
Sorry, ghouls! If you can't keep up,
you get left behind!

57:12.760 --> 57:13.860
Kala!

57:13.960 --> 57:16.700
She left us! I can't believe it!
Now, what do we do?

57:16.800 --> 57:18.006
Come on, sis.

57:18.120 --> 57:20.180
We've seen this tide was going to turn.

57:20.280 --> 57:22.620
We don't need Kala, we have each other.

57:22.720 --> 57:24.180
Okay. You're right.

57:24.280 --> 57:25.620
We can get out of this mess.

57:25.720 --> 57:27.380
We just have to put our...

57:29.040 --> 57:30.530
...back into it!

57:31.760 --> 57:33.524
Whoo-hoo!

57:38.200 --> 57:40.885
We need to lead the Kraken
away from the town!

57:52.400 --> 57:53.540
Posea!

57:53.640 --> 57:54.721
- Help!
- Help!

57:55.520 --> 57:57.966
- The Kraken is coming!
- Quick!

57:58.760 --> 58:00.700
- He's coming!
- Lagoona!

58:10.360 --> 58:12.820
So, did you face your fear?

58:12.920 --> 58:14.604
- Yes!
- Oh, good.

58:14.760 --> 58:18.321
Oh, no, your sea lifeline
is still... Well, look.

58:18.640 --> 58:20.642
But...

58:20.880 --> 58:24.444
Yeah. Really fun talking to you,
but right now, we've got a Kraken problem!

58:24.560 --> 58:25.700
Send us back to Monster High!

58:25.800 --> 58:28.140
But you know, if you go back now,

58:28.240 --> 58:32.370
your fear will only follow you.

58:32.600 --> 58:33.931
I'm begging you.

58:34.360 --> 58:37.011
- This is so breaking the rules.
- Please!

58:37.360 --> 58:39.442
So be it!

58:52.320 --> 58:53.651
Oopsie.

58:58.600 --> 58:59.965
Oh. Oh.

59:03.640 --> 59:07.486
So mice to be able to talk
now that Toralei's gone.

59:07.880 --> 59:11.521
Yeah, she always hogs the conversation.

59:14.520 --> 59:15.521
Huh?

59:16.760 --> 59:18.569
Whoa!

59:19.240 --> 59:20.241
Ah!

59:24.560 --> 59:25.971
Whoa!

59:27.000 --> 59:28.968
Whoa!

59:34.720 --> 59:37.564
I thought cats always landed
on their feet.

59:37.760 --> 59:40.764
Hey, I'd like to see you land on your...

59:41.440 --> 59:43.220
Wait! I have feet!

59:43.320 --> 59:45.380
I even have my legs back!

59:45.480 --> 59:47.900
It's a good thing. I like my shoes.

59:48.000 --> 59:49.460
Is everyone okay?

59:49.560 --> 59:50.925
Ah, we made it!

59:51.400 --> 59:52.765
It's over!

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:09.407
Well, well, well, Lagoona.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:14.008
Looks like running away
to Monster High didn't work this time.

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:18.540
Great Kraken, destroy it all!

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:20.780
Swim!

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:22.370
I mean, run!

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:25.361
Lagoona!

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:27.091
Come here and face me!

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:39.204
Come out, come out, where ever you are!

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:56.968
Hey! Eyes on your own paper!

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:00.321
Whoa!

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:01.921
Run!

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:11.220
- Clawd Wolf!
- Draculaura!

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.540
- The school...
- You're back!

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:14.100
...is under attack!

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:15.440
We need everyone's help to fight!

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:17.410
- Fight who?
- That.

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:21.363
Where is Lagoona?

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:24.048
Aw, she doesn't look so tough.

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:25.361
Not that.

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:31.180
That!

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:33.123
Now, that looks too tough!

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.968
What are we going to do?

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:46.620
The Kraken is going
to destroy Monster High!

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:49.020
- We need a distraction.
- What's the plan?

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:50.100
We can't beat them,

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.850
- and we can't outrun them.
- True that.

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.020
The only chance we have
of saving Monster High

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:56.487
is for me to convince Kala
to call off the Kraken.

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.340
Are you fearious?

01:01:58.440 --> 01:01:59.771
Do you think you can do that?

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:02.540
I have to.

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:05.803
I hope you're all ready
for a little stage fright!

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:09.340
- Ready, ghouls?
- I don't like this plan.

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:10.700
It's the only one we've got.

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:14.100
Yeti afraid of nothing
but yak milk shortage.

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:15.420
Let's with the doing.

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:16.806
We're in.

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:21.481
Oh, Lagoona, I know you're in here.

01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:24.200
Did you freeze on stage again?

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:29.201
Grr.

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:41.460
- Oh, no, Lagoona!
- Lagoona, no!

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:43.210
- Don't go that way!
- Watch out for the Kraken!

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:44.740
The Kraken's out there!

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:46.380
Get them!

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:48.687
Oh, no, the Kraken!

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:51.207
Where is Lagoona?

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:54.046
Let's put this stinky fish on ice!

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:02.640
Who's freezing now, Kala?

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.244
- That's your cue!
- What? Oh.

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:07.444
Hey, Kraken-a-lacken!

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:09.250
Eyes on me, dude!

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:13.720
Oh, bummer.

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:23.762
Oh, no! Look out!

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:27.290
Whoa!

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:30.940
Never to be sending a Gorgon
to do job of Yeti.

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:35.250
Where's Lagoona?

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.921
This is like swimming upstream.

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:47.140
Over here!

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:48.401
Mr. Krake!

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.084
Sorry! All out!

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:01.446
Show yourself, Lagoona!

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:09.044
Hey, fish head, stop!

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:11.531
Toralei time.

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:13.928
Fright, six, seven, eight!

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:17.970
What in the world are you doing?

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:21.648
Something nobody has the power
to look away from.

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.724
Jazz hands!

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.406
Hey!

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:41.241
Whoa!

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:43.928
- Kala!
- Lagoona!

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:46.811
Please, call off the Kraken!

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:49.500
You can't always run from what scares you.

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:52.540
No, Kala, I ran to it, to you.

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:53.900
You're afraid of me?

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.380
Of course, I am! You bullied me!

01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:59.324
Maybe that's because
the entire town bullied me!

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:03.900
Kala, I don't understand.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.500
Of course, you don't!

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:06.900
No one does!

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.580
But I want to.

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:10.940
Please, just call off the Kraken.

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:15.446
It's terrible, isn't it?

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:18.900
To see the people you love
being chased away in fear.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.660
Why are you doing this?

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:24.220
You'll never understand what it's like
for someone to hate you for what you are!

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:26.049
To judge you because
of what you look like!

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:28.340
To push you away because you scare them!

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:30.740
- Who's done that to you?
- Everyone!

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:34.340
But you're destroying a place
that doesn't do that.

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:35.900
Monster High is different!

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.525
I don't believe you!

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.580
No one is an outcast here!

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:47.763
We celebrate everyone's freaky flaws.

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:50.690
There's a place here for every monster.

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:56.731
So, at Monster High
I won't be judged for my flaws?

01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:00.803
As long as you don't judge yourself.

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:20.244
Put her down, Dad.

01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:24.260
- Dad?
- Dad?

01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:25.486
Dad?

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:33.409
Dad, this is my childhood friend, Lagoona.

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:36.660
Lagoona, Dad.

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:55.300
So, the Kraken is your dad?

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:58.820
And, that stuff we saw
in the Dark, that was yours?

01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:00.126
My bedroom.

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:03.289
- The pictures on the rock?
- Dad's drawings of me.

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:09.807
So, when Peri told me you had looked
the Kraken in the eye...

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.020
I look him in the eye all the time.
He's my dad.

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:14.860
But the rest of the town...

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:18.328
Thought he was evil,
just beclaws of his looks.

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:21.206
Including me.

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:23.740
They didn't know that he taught me
how to roller surf.

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:26.650
And, that he makes an amazing kelpburger.

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:30.460
When I saw you with
your big, happy family,

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:34.610
the kind of family that no one
ran away from, I was so angry.

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:38.606
I was ashamed that he was my dad,
but it's really my fault.

01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:41.220
If I had told someone, if I had explained,

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:45.100
if I had shown them
that my dad just looks scary...

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:47.931
I'm so, so sorry.

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:51.180
You'd really like him
if you got to know him.

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:52.380
Everyone would.

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:54.050
Then you should join us here!

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:56.847
We accept everyone's freaky flaws.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.846
I'm so sorry I made fun of you
for going belly up.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.060
Don't be.

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:04.900
The past made me who I am today,

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.809
and I like who I am.

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.969
Freaky flaws and all.

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:13.980
So in the end, not only did Lagoona
face her deepest fear...

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:15.081
Mmm-mmm.

01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:18.540
...she even made friends with it!

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:21.620
If there's one thing
we all learned Down Under,

01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:25.361
it's that things are
not always as they seem.

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:32.162
Come on, Heath, let's go!

01:08:32.479 --> 01:08:33.481
Whoa!

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:35.921
Wow!

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:40.779
Let's keep this party going!

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:42.689
Ghoul friend is back!

01:08:43.439 --> 01:08:45.522
Hey, hey, hey, pretty good
with a barbeque there!

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:49.042
And, then, it turns out
that Mr. Kraken is a vegan!

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:51.801
Have you tasted the kelpburger?

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:53.899
It's really good. He's a great vegan chef!

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.444
Such a nice party.

01:08:57.439 --> 01:08:58.680
One sec.

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:06.368
So, am I invited to this party?

01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:09.411
Hmm, well, I don't know.

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:12.890
Of course! Every monster is.

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:14.620
Good one.

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:17.564
- Every monster every monster?
- Sure!

01:09:18.399 --> 01:09:20.129
Come on up, ghouls!

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.060
Oh, welcome to Monster High!

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:26.526
Join the party!

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.448
Here, let me help you down.

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:31.819
- I like the new Kala!
- I love it!

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:34.526
Wow, it's so bizarre up here!

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:36.848
This place is boo-tiful!

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:39.380
- I just feel like dancing!
- Oh, we can dance?

01:09:39.479 --> 01:09:40.481
Oh, my gosh!

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:42.648
I don't know if two heads
are better than one,

01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:44.779
but they sure yap twice as much!

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:48.859
Okay, now I know
everything's back to normal.

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:50.260
Oh!

01:09:50.359 --> 01:09:52.740
Yep. Back to normal.

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:55.730
Freaky flaws and all.

01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:59.340
Looks fin-tastic.

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:01.204
I think so, too.

01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:03.700
And, as the sign says,

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:08.283
be yourself, be unique, be a monster.

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.688
Love is like a star

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:22.170
Good job, Lagoona!

01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:31.447
Bravery comes from the heart.
