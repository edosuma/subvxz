33:05.166 --> 33:06.833
Ah, Peter Godwin.

33:07.291 --> 33:10.875
I have a contract here to supply books
to the wider community.

33:11.041 --> 33:12.333
Now, it's nothing special,

33:12.458 --> 33:16.041

Hey.

33:23.916 --> 33:25.583
You have other priorities.

33:28.458 --> 33:29.375
Now.

33:32.541 --> 33:36.875
These books are old,
but the knowledge inside them is older.

33:37.458 --> 33:39.625
Mathematics predates the pyramids,

33:39.875 --> 33:42.791
and some say that physics predates time.

33:43.041 --> 33:45.333
And good grammar is timeless.

33:46.833 --> 33:49.166
Some, sitting where you are,

33:49.291 --> 33:51.958

at a disadvantage, that, uh,

33:52.416 --> 33:53.916
they don't have Internet,

33:54.208 --> 33:55.708
a computer, a tablet.

33:56.416 --> 34:00.833
But all Aristotle needed
was a twig and some sand.

34:01.125 --> 34:04.583
And the only tablet Shakespeare used
was a piece of slate.

34:06.208 --> 34:07.333
Now.

34:10.166 --> 34:12.791
This is one half of what we need.

34:13.416 --> 34:14.791
What is the other half?

34:16.916 --> 34:20.125
-Me.
-Yes! Good. Good...

this year is halfway through.

Now, you haven't studied

34:29.166 --> 34:33.958

it slow and have you take exams next year.

34:34.083 --> 34:35.000
[sighs]

34:37.666 --> 34:38.708
And the other option?

34:40.833 --> 34:42.041
We jump right in,

34:42.625 --> 34:43.666

34:44.458 --> 34:46.333
