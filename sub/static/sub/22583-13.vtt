{\i1}Previously on Enterprise :{\i0}
Status.

00:02.878 --> 00:05.005
We're getting reports of anomalies on all decks.

00:11.261 --> 00:14.306
Think what you're asking me to do.

00:15.098 --> 00:19.561
Build a weapon to destroy an entire world.

00:23.315 --> 00:26.568
We do not have enough information about the humans.

00:26.568 --> 00:28.403
That can be remedied.

00:28.403 --> 00:30.572
They're locking on to the starboard docking port.

00:33.700 --> 00:37.204
I'm reading 23 intruders on Decks C, D and E.

00:42.584 --> 00:45.712
We're preparing to test the weapon on an uninhabited planet,

00:45.754 --> 00:48.090
but we're going to need another shipment of kemocite.

00:48.090 --> 00:49.716
I'll contact Gralik.

00:51.468 --> 00:54.972
Gralik, I have some questions for you.

00:55.013 --> 00:57.349
I want to know where they're shipping this kemocite.

00:57.349 --> 00:59.518
It could lead us to the weapon.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.019
There's no doubt about it, Captain.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.814
This isotope was used in the weapon that attacked Earth.

01:03.856 --> 01:07.317
You offered to help us. Are you still willing ?

01:07.317 --> 01:09.528
If you're prepared to trust me.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.865
We've modified the radiolytic signature.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.576
If you can get it on board their ship,
I'll be able to track it.

01:15.576 --> 01:19.413
Degra is going to discover that you sabotaged his kemocite.

01:19.413 --> 01:22.374
You should just be concerned with finding this weapon.

01:22.374 --> 01:24.126
They broke orbit five minutes ago, Captain.

01:24.168 --> 01:25.669
{\i1}ARCHER : Are you picking up the tracking signal ?

01:25.669 --> 01:27.254
SATO: Loud and clear.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.074

01:41.602 --> 01:42.811
Yes.

01:42.853 --> 01:46.523
{\i1}Commander Shran, would you come to the Bridge ?

01:49.693 --> 01:50.569
Status.

01:50.569 --> 01:52.112
We've lost the warp trail.

01:54.448 --> 01:55.949
Continue scanning.

01:55.991 --> 01:57.659
You know what we're looking for, Lieutenant.

01:57.701 --> 01:59.369
It shouldn't be that difficult to find.

02:00.621 --> 02:01.955
Commander.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.960
We've been searching for weeks.

02:07.002 --> 02:09.963
And we'll continue searching until
we've accomplished our mission.

02:10.005 --> 02:11.298
Or until we're destroyed ?

02:12.174 --> 02:15.219
You've seen what this place is like.
What are the chances they've survived ?

02:15.219 --> 02:16.970
We have our orders.

02:16.970 --> 02:20.390
We should head back to Andoria while we're still able.

02:21.767 --> 02:24.603
You sound like you're afraid of this Expanse, Lieutenant.

02:25.938 --> 02:30.150
I'd expect that from a Vulcan,
not a member of the Imperial Guard.

02:32.402 --> 02:34.154
Continue scanning.

02:35.531 --> 02:38.659
Don't underestimate these pinkskins, Lieutenant.

02:40.953 --> 02:42.913
They're still out there.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.373
- Where are the others ?
- Delayed.

04:08.415 --> 04:14.338
- I said the matter was urgent.
- Typical humanoid arrogance.

04:14.379 --> 04:18.716
You expect us to come scurrying whenever it suits you.

04:18.716 --> 04:21.303
I'm sorry to inconvenience you,

04:21.345 --> 04:24.640
but I'm sure you'll find the journey worth the effort.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.141
The weapon is ready ?

04:27.643 --> 04:31.688
- Not quite.
- Then why are you wasting our time ?

04:31.688 --> 04:35.400
The new prototype has been completed.
We've scheduled a test.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.195
- When ?
- Three days.

04:38.237 --> 04:42.324
You'll be able to view the test remotely from this chamber.

04:42.366 --> 04:47.579
If everything goes as planned,
we should be ready to deploy the final version in a month,

04:47.621 --> 04:53.126
- maybe sooner.
- And the human threat will finally be eliminated.

04:53.126 --> 04:57.130
I hope you find that worth your time.

05:00.392 --> 05:03.131
{\a7}[03x13] {\u1}PROVING GROUND{\r}

05:05.556 --> 05:09.101
{\a10}The signal was so weak I wasn't even sure
that it was there at first.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.686
{\a10}- But you are now ?
- Yes, sir.

05:10.686 --> 05:14.189
{\a10}The isotopic signature matches the kemocite
that you planted on the Xindi ship.

05:14.189 --> 05:18.694
{\a10}Set a course. Tell Trip I want everything
he can give me from the engines.

05:18.694 --> 05:23.782
{\a10}Captain, as you know, Ensign Sato and I
have been working to reconstruct our database.

05:23.782 --> 05:25.784
- And ?
- We've managed to dig

05:25.826 --> 05:29.037
{\a10}about 30% of the lost data
out of the redundant memory core.

05:29.037 --> 05:32.916
{\a10}Enough to begin piecing together a map
of the spatial anomalies.

05:32.916 --> 05:36.587
{\a10}The signal lies just beyond a dense field of them.

05:36.628 --> 05:37.754
Here.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.214
How long to go around it ?

05:39.256 --> 05:43.051
{\a10}The field is massive. 17 days at warp five.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.849
{\a10}Alert the crew it's going to get rough.

06:00.736 --> 06:02.654
- Tucker to the Bridge.
ARCHER : {\i1}- Go ahead.

06:02.654 --> 06:04.990
I've got the warp reactor buttoned up.

06:04.990 --> 06:07.534
{\a10}{\i1}- We're as ready as we'll ever be.{\i0}
- Acknowledged.

06:08.493 --> 06:09.328
T'Pol ?

06:09.369 --> 06:13.832
{\a10}I've charted the largest anomalies,
but the field is extremely dense.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.126
We may not be able to avoid all of them.

06:16.126 --> 06:17.419
Do your best.

06:18.879 --> 06:22.424
{\a10}Travis... take us in.

06:23.425 --> 06:25.928
{\a10}- One half impulse.
- Aye, sir.

06:33.852 --> 06:36.939
Come to bearing two-seven-five, mark eight.

06:40.484 --> 06:41.610
Hard to port !

06:49.952 --> 06:52.579
{\a10}We just grazed it.
No damage.

06:54.039 --> 06:56.458
{\a10}Just how accurate is this map of yours ?

06:56.458 --> 06:59.670
{\a10}Considering I only have 30%
of our database to work with...

06:59.711 --> 07:02.840
There's an anomaly forming directly ahead.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.678
- It's expanding.
- Expanding ?

07:07.719 --> 07:10.973
I've never seen this before.
They're merging, building on one another.

07:11.014 --> 07:14.059
- Which way, Sub-commander ?
- It's growing too rapidly.

07:14.059 --> 07:15.769
Emergency power to hull plating !

07:15.811 --> 07:17.354
Brace for impact !

07:38.167 --> 07:39.293
We're losing hull integrity.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.086
Atmosphere is venting on D-Deck.

07:41.128 --> 07:44.965
- Come about. Get us out of here.
- The helm's not responding.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.634
- We've been completely enveloped.
- Main power's going down.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.511
Sir, I'm picking up something out there.

07:49.511 --> 07:51.972
- I think it's a ship.
- Can you identify it ?

07:51.972 --> 07:53.682
There's too much distortion.

07:58.228 --> 08:00.105
A tractor beam's locked on to us.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.943
We've been pulled out.

08:06.737 --> 08:08.197
They're hailing us.

08:09.323 --> 08:11.783
I guess we owe someone thank you.

08:16.747 --> 08:18.624
{\i1}Captain Archer.

08:19.875 --> 08:23.754
{\i1}Look at the trouble you've gotten
your pink skin into this time.

08:24.546 --> 08:25.881
( sighs )

08:30.802 --> 08:33.054
You're braver than I imagined.

08:34.431 --> 08:39.144
I wouldn't try to traverse an anomaly field
in a ship this fragile.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.606
You don't seem to be having any trouble.

08:43.315 --> 08:45.984
We've discovered a few tricks to deal with them.

08:46.610 --> 08:48.195
How did you locate us ?

08:49.905 --> 08:53.867
We have a record of your warp signature
from our last encounter.

08:54.326 --> 08:57.287
Our ships are considerably faster than Enterprise.

08:57.287 --> 08:58.914
It wasn't difficult to catch up with you.

08:58.956 --> 09:01.500
That explains how you got here, it doesn't explain why.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.877
Your world was brutally attacked.

09:03.919 --> 09:07.339
The Imperial Guard thought
you'd be grateful to have an ally...

09:07.381 --> 09:10.843
considering no one else came rushing to your aid.

09:10.884 --> 09:14.221
And how did the Imperial Guard
know Earth had been attacked ?

09:14.263 --> 09:17.099
Seven million killed ?
Not exactly a state secret.

09:17.099 --> 09:19.351
Especially if you're monitoring communications

09:19.351 --> 09:21.895
between Starfleet and the Vulcan High Command.

09:24.356 --> 09:26.817
What happened to your uniform, Sub-commander ?

09:27.985 --> 09:31.780
Not that I don't find your new look becoming, but...

09:33.907 --> 09:37.703
it's not exactly regulation, is it ?

09:37.703 --> 09:39.538
I resigned my commission.

09:39.580 --> 09:42.291
Yes, and I believe I heard something about that.

09:42.332 --> 09:44.418
Why are you here ?

09:47.379 --> 09:51.258
Your world is in jeopardy, and where are your friends ?

09:52.301 --> 09:55.804
The Vulcans. Where is their mighty fleet ?

09:55.804 --> 09:59.474
They couldn't even spare one officer.

09:59.516 --> 10:02.895
She was forced to abandon her career to remain on your ship.

10:04.229 --> 10:08.609
A remarkably selfless act... for a Vulcan.

10:09.902 --> 10:11.653
But we've come to your aid.

10:11.653 --> 10:14.364
We've come into the Expanse when they refused.

10:15.532 --> 10:18.285
We're here to help you.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.704
If you don't want our assistance,

10:20.746 --> 10:23.582
then we'll leave you to deal with the Xindi on your own...

10:24.416 --> 10:26.960
just like the Vulcans have done.

10:28.837 --> 10:31.548
Targeting sensors are down, hull plating...

10:31.548 --> 10:34.384
We're damn lucky the torpedoes were all in safe mode.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.929
- If one of them had detonated...
- Phase-cannons ?

10:36.929 --> 10:40.349
They haven't even got enough power to light a campfire.

10:40.349 --> 10:41.391
How long to fix them ?

10:41.433 --> 10:43.685
I couldn't even guess without a chance to sort this out.

10:45.437 --> 10:49.191
Commander Shran offered to send
his tactical officer over to help.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.361
We'd be giving them access to critical systems, sir.

10:52.402 --> 10:55.531
The kemocite signal Hoshi picked up
could lead us to the Xindi weapon.

10:55.572 --> 10:57.533
We're going to need our defenses.

11:01.036 --> 11:04.581
I don't like the idea of having
the Andorians down here any more than you do...

11:05.624 --> 11:07.584
but we could use their help.

11:09.711 --> 11:11.255
Aye, sir.

11:26.854 --> 11:29.898
- The Andorian shuttle has docked.
- Good. Let's put them to work.

11:29.940 --> 11:33.277
I recommend we assign a security detail to each repair crew.

11:33.318 --> 11:35.571
You've been talking to Lieutenant Reed ?

11:36.738 --> 11:39.199
They're here to help, T'Pol.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.368
That doesn't mean we shouldn't exercise caution.

11:41.410 --> 11:44.329
I'm not going to ask them to work with guns at their heads

11:44.329 --> 11:46.415
just because you don't like them.

11:46.415 --> 11:49.585
I neither like nor dislike Andorians.

11:49.626 --> 11:52.421
I simply had a great deal of experience with them.

11:52.421 --> 11:53.714
I appreciate that.

11:53.755 --> 11:58.010
But whatever problems exist between Vulcan
and Andoria don't involve us.

11:58.010 --> 11:59.469
Not at the moment.

11:59.511 --> 12:02.639
We weren't always so antagonistic, Captain.

12:02.681 --> 12:04.850
In fact, despite their heightened emotions,

12:04.892 --> 12:08.645
our first contact with Andorians seemed promising.

12:09.771 --> 12:10.731
What happened ?

12:11.607 --> 12:12.983
They were duplicitous.

12:13.025 --> 12:16.904
They only honored agreements that didn't conflict
with their interests.

12:17.779 --> 12:20.324
Is that your assessment or the High Command's ?

12:20.324 --> 12:22.576
Considering the importance of this mission,

12:22.618 --> 12:26.538
I feel compelled to point out
that they've proven untrustworthy in the past.

12:29.374 --> 12:31.251
I don't trust them either, T'Pol,

12:32.294 --> 12:34.129
but based on my experience,

12:34.171 --> 12:36.840
I think I can trust Commander Shran.

12:39.301 --> 12:42.346
- Coffee, black.
- No tea ?

12:42.721 --> 12:44.890
Yeah, no crumpets, either,thank you.

12:44.932 --> 12:47.726
Oh, I need all the caffeine I can get.

12:47.768 --> 12:50.020
What's the situation in Engineering ?

12:50.062 --> 12:53.315
- Bad. The Armory ?
- Worse.

12:53.315 --> 12:54.983
Which one of you is Reed ?

12:55.025 --> 12:56.735
I'm Lieutenant Reed.

12:56.777 --> 13:02.741
I assumed I'd find you in the Armory, not relaxing here.

13:02.741 --> 13:03.283
( sniffs )

13:03.283 --> 13:04.243
What is that?

13:05.452 --> 13:06.995
It's coffee.

13:06.995 --> 13:09.248
And just for the record, I haven't left the armory

13:09.289 --> 13:12.000
for so much as a bathroom break in nearly 12 hours.

13:12.042 --> 13:14.211
And... you are ?

13:14.253 --> 13:17.339
Lieutenant Talas of the Imperial Warship Kumari.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.760
This is Commander Tucker, our chief engineer.

13:21.802 --> 13:22.719
Pleasure.

13:22.761 --> 13:24.680
I've been ordered to assist you.

13:24.680 --> 13:26.265
Indeed.

13:26.306 --> 13:30.602
Well, I'll see if I can find something for you to do.

13:30.602 --> 13:32.229
I have duties of my own.

13:32.229 --> 13:35.732
The sooner your ship is repaired,
the sooner I can get back to them.

13:37.067 --> 13:38.861
Well, I'll let you two get acquainted.

13:42.030 --> 13:44.449
I wasn't sure we'd find you alive.

13:45.868 --> 13:47.828
Under the circumstances,

13:48.871 --> 13:52.666
I'd say we have something to celebrate.

13:54.001 --> 13:57.421
I appreciate the gesture,
but we have a lot of repairs to make.

13:57.462 --> 14:01.300
And your crew is doing a fine job of making them.
Have a drink with me.

14:02.092 --> 14:04.928
You've earned a brief respite.

14:05.762 --> 14:07.181
Andorian ale.

14:08.098 --> 14:11.560
You seemed to enjoy it the last time we met.

14:13.562 --> 14:17.524
I took the liberty of bringing a few extra bottles.

14:17.524 --> 14:18.984
Thanks.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.404
To a swift victory.

14:30.913 --> 14:32.206
( sighs )

14:32.206 --> 14:33.040
So...

14:33.040 --> 14:35.459
( pouring more ale )

14:35.459 --> 14:37.294
How did you get picked for this assignment ?

14:37.294 --> 14:41.423
I volunteered. It made sense.

14:41.465 --> 14:44.760
I've had the greatest amount of contact with pink...

14:46.595 --> 14:48.555
With humans.

14:48.555 --> 14:53.977
And the last time we met, you helped my people avert a war.

14:54.019 --> 14:56.438
I don't like unpaid debts.

14:56.438 --> 14:59.316
We keep doing each other favors.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.861
Isn't that how alliances are born ?

15:10.202 --> 15:12.120
I haven't seen you in a while.

15:12.162 --> 15:15.624
As long as you're here, maybe you can give me a hand.

15:16.875 --> 15:20.879
Touch this to the phase regulator there,

15:20.921 --> 15:22.923
while I check the polarity.

15:25.467 --> 15:27.469
I thought you might be avoiding me.

15:28.679 --> 15:32.057
Three neuro-pressure sessions a week is hardly avoiding you.

15:32.099 --> 15:32.599
Yeah.

15:32.641 --> 15:35.686
The Captain asked for an update on your repairs.

15:35.727 --> 15:38.522
Well, three of the injectors are burned out,

15:38.564 --> 15:40.691
the restricter coils are completely fried...

15:40.691 --> 15:42.359
How long until we have warp ?

15:42.401 --> 15:45.195
I would say at least two days, but, uh,

15:45.237 --> 15:47.489
the blue guys really know their stuff.

15:47.489 --> 15:49.241
We should be up and running in about,

15:49.241 --> 15:50.993
oh, 12 hours.

15:53.245 --> 15:54.830
- Is there a problem ?
- No.

15:54.872 --> 15:57.791
Keep me informed of your progress.

16:07.801 --> 16:09.553
Hand me the micro-spanner, please.

16:10.053 --> 16:11.138
I've brought some equipment

16:11.180 --> 16:13.640
that should align those relays much more precisely.

16:13.682 --> 16:15.767
This spanner will do the job nicely.

16:16.435 --> 16:17.728
If you wouldn't mind.

16:19.229 --> 16:22.024
Is there else I can get you ?

16:22.065 --> 16:25.444
- Some coffee perhaps ?
- Oh, that'll be lovely.

16:25.444 --> 16:28.697
Since you clearly don't need my help
I'll return to my ship.

16:28.697 --> 16:30.407
Thank you for the hospitality.

16:30.407 --> 16:32.534
Give my regards to Commander Shran.

16:34.620 --> 16:36.330
For what it's worth, Lieutenant,

16:36.330 --> 16:38.415
I'm not here to steal your secrets.

16:39.124 --> 16:41.126
It'd hardly be worth the effort.

16:42.169 --> 16:43.712
I beg your pardon ?

16:43.712 --> 16:45.589
Last time I saw weapons like these

16:45.631 --> 16:47.758
was during my early tactical training.

16:47.799 --> 16:51.512
I'm sorry I wasted your time on our primitive systems.

16:51.553 --> 16:52.596
Not at all.

16:52.596 --> 16:54.681
I found it nostalgic.

16:54.681 --> 16:58.393
Just be careful when you reconnect that to your powergrid.

16:58.393 --> 17:01.438
You didn't reset the EPS synchronizer.

17:01.480 --> 17:04.858
You may singe your eyebrows when you bring it back online.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.862
Lieutenant Talas ?

17:14.284 --> 17:18.497
I apologize if I've been rude.

17:18.539 --> 17:19.915
Why don't I get us both a cup of coffee

17:19.957 --> 17:23.252
and we can align these relays together.

17:26.630 --> 17:30.133
{\i1}Captain's Starlog December 6, 2153.

17:30.843 --> 17:33.095
{\i1}With some assistance from the Andorians

17:33.095 --> 17:35.472
{\i1}we've managed to steer clear of anomalies.

17:35.514 --> 17:37.516
200 million kilometers.

17:37.558 --> 17:39.518
Close enough, Travis.

17:39.560 --> 17:41.353
We don't want to give ourselves away.

17:41.395 --> 17:42.354
Aye, sir.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.065
It's a G-type star system,

17:45.065 --> 17:47.359
six planets with over a hundred moons.

17:47.401 --> 17:48.652
Any bio signs ?

17:48.652 --> 17:51.113
There's a great deal of debris in the system.

17:51.154 --> 17:52.656
I can't tell from this range.

17:52.698 --> 17:54.783
Our sensors are more sophisticated than yours.

17:54.825 --> 17:56.160
We should be able to scan the system

17:56.160 --> 17:58.203
without betraying our presence. If I may.

17:59.163 --> 18:00.998
- This is Commander Shran.
{\i1}- Go ahead.

18:00.998 --> 18:03.917
Transfer our long-range sensor data to Enterprise.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.085
{\i1}Yes, Commander.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.173
It's coming in.

18:15.596 --> 18:19.433
T'POL : Four vessels. All Xindi.

18:28.775 --> 18:32.404
T'POL : Many of the moons show evidence
of extensive weapons bombardment.

18:33.405 --> 18:38.118
Why attack an uninhabited system ?

18:38.160 --> 18:40.287
I don't think they attacked anyone.

18:41.455 --> 18:43.290
It's Bikini Atoll.

18:44.249 --> 18:45.125
What ?

18:45.167 --> 18:47.544
When my species was developing primitive nuclear weapons,

18:47.711 --> 18:49.129
they needed places to test them.

18:49.171 --> 18:52.216
One was a remote island called Bikini Atoll.

18:52.216 --> 18:56.261
- So you believe this is some kind of proving ground ?
- It's possible.

18:56.261 --> 18:59.890
If they are getting ready to test their weapon,
we're running out of time.

19:00.849 --> 19:02.643
I wouldn't recommend a frontal assault.

19:03.685 --> 19:06.730
Your weapons are damaged, critical systems
are down all over your ship.

19:06.730 --> 19:08.690
And you're outnumbered four-to-one.

19:08.690 --> 19:10.275
I thought it was four-to-two.

19:10.317 --> 19:14.947
Even our combined forces don't stand a chance
against that kind of firepower.

19:14.988 --> 19:18.867
I'm not ready to risk my ship
when we don't even know if the Xindi weapon is here.

19:18.909 --> 19:19.993
I agree.

19:20.702 --> 19:22.621
We need to get a closer look.

19:24.081 --> 19:25.958
What do you propose we do...

19:25.999 --> 19:29.586
fly up to them and ask them what they're doing ?

19:34.299 --> 19:36.593
Ensign, Commander.

19:36.635 --> 19:37.886
I'll take him from here.

19:37.928 --> 19:41.557
Mr. Tucker, how are your repairs coming along ?

19:41.557 --> 19:43.267
Pretty well, thanks to your people.

19:43.267 --> 19:45.644
But I was wondering if I could ask you a favor.

19:45.686 --> 19:49.731
I'm told your anti-matter injectors
use variable compression nozzles.

19:49.773 --> 19:52.067
Told by whom ? That's rather sensitive information.

19:52.067 --> 19:53.694
I don't want to get anyone in trouble,

19:53.735 --> 19:56.613
but one of those injectors
would work wonders for our engines.

19:56.655 --> 19:58.156
I imagine it would.

19:58.198 --> 20:00.075
I don't know, Commander.

20:00.117 --> 20:03.120
That's a sophisticated piece of technology.

20:03.829 --> 20:06.665
- I thought we were allies here.
- That remains to be seen.

20:08.709 --> 20:11.795
You have my condolences over the attack on your world.

20:13.088 --> 20:14.131
Thanks.

20:14.131 --> 20:16.592
I understand your sister was killed.

20:17.885 --> 20:19.970
Captain Archer told me.

20:21.930 --> 20:23.932
Well, lots of people lost family.

20:25.392 --> 20:28.604
No great victory comes without sacrifice.

20:29.980 --> 20:33.358
The dispute between my people
and the Vulcans hasn't been bloodless.

20:34.318 --> 20:38.864
Border skirmishes were common a few decades ago.

20:38.906 --> 20:42.284
They'd violate our territory, we'd retaliate.

20:42.326 --> 20:46.580
I was still in school when my older brother
joined the Imperial Guard.

20:47.498 --> 20:51.335
He was assigned to a forward surveillance unit.

20:52.419 --> 20:56.548
I can understand why you seek vengeance against these Xindi.

20:56.590 --> 20:59.426
I'd love to get my hands on whoever ordered that attack...

21:01.261 --> 21:03.847
but that's not why we're here.

21:05.307 --> 21:09.853
You have no desire to make these people
pay for the death of your sister ?

21:10.687 --> 21:14.525
I just want to make sure they don't get
the chance to finish what they started.

21:17.110 --> 21:19.071
( door slides open )

21:19.780 --> 21:21.782
So any help you can give us...

21:23.450 --> 21:26.870
I'll have that anti-matter injector delivered to you.

21:26.870 --> 21:28.872
I appreciate it.

21:35.712 --> 21:37.840
{\i1}XINDI-HUMANOID ( over com ) : Degra, what's the delay ?

21:38.549 --> 21:39.424
Stand by.

21:39.466 --> 21:42.761
We have been standing by for nearly an hour.

21:42.803 --> 21:45.264
{\i1}We're confirming the final power readings.

21:45.264 --> 21:48.767
I wouldn't want you to be disappointed with the results.

21:48.767 --> 21:50.018
Deploy the weapon.

22:00.988 --> 22:03.115
Initiate firing protocols.

22:10.205 --> 22:12.958
( alarm blaring )

22:13.458 --> 22:16.628
- What is it ?
DEGRA : {\i1}A ship just entered the system.

22:16.670 --> 22:19.256
{\a10}What kind of ship ?

22:19.298 --> 22:21.592
We can't identify it. Abort the test.

22:21.592 --> 22:23.218
Return the weapon to the launch platform.

22:24.511 --> 22:25.971
{\i1}Degra, report.

22:26.013 --> 22:26.972
Stand by.

22:27.014 --> 22:28.307
Activate all defense systems.

22:28.348 --> 22:30.309
Contact the other vessels and have them intercept that ship.

22:30.350 --> 22:31.810
Degra ?

22:31.852 --> 22:33.437
{\i1}DEGRA : We are securing the weapon.

22:33.478 --> 22:35.480
I'll resume contact when I can.

22:40.861 --> 22:42.613
We're receiving a transmission from the ship.

22:44.656 --> 22:46.658
{\i1}Allow me to introduce myself.

22:46.700 --> 22:50.287
My name is Shran of the Andorian Mining Consortium.

22:50.329 --> 22:54.541
{\i1}You've entered restricted space. Leave immediately.

22:54.541 --> 22:58.420
{\i1}Restricted ?
I had no idea.

22:58.462 --> 22:59.880
{\i1}We don't want to cause any trouble.

22:59.880 --> 23:02.382
{\i1}We're looking for a rare element...

23:03.675 --> 23:04.885
Archerite.

23:04.885 --> 23:08.305
We picked up some promising readings
coming from your system.

23:08.305 --> 23:11.350
{\i1}I don't care what you're looking for.
Turn your ship around and leave.

23:11.391 --> 23:13.310
Of course, of course.

23:13.352 --> 23:15.854
But you don't mind if we finish our scans ?

23:16.813 --> 23:19.691
Archerite is extremely valuable to us.

23:19.733 --> 23:23.779
{\i1}Even a few kilos will pay our expenses
for the next ten cycles.

23:23.820 --> 23:25.197
They're scanning our ships.

23:25.239 --> 23:27.741
{\i1}We're not trying to violate your privacy.

23:27.783 --> 23:32.663
Our sensors are omni-directional.
There's nothing to be concerned about.

23:32.704 --> 23:36.458
Deactivate your scans and leave or we'll destroy you.

23:37.668 --> 23:40.128
{\i1}There's no need for threats.

23:43.924 --> 23:45.217
We'll leave.

23:45.259 --> 23:48.929
{\i1}But if this system does contain Archerite
you just missed out

23:48.971 --> 23:52.099
{\i1}your opportunity to collect a generous percentage.

23:54.518 --> 23:55.686
Stop the scan.

23:55.686 --> 23:59.398
Take us out of the system, but not too quickly.

24:00.315 --> 24:05.112
The Andorian Mining Consortium runs from no one.

24:08.448 --> 24:10.909
It's emitting high levels of radiation.

24:10.909 --> 24:12.619
It could be anything.

24:12.661 --> 24:15.289
A power generator of some kind. A fusion reactor.

24:15.289 --> 24:18.625
It has the same quantum signature
as the weapon that attacked Earth.

24:18.625 --> 24:20.294
What's the status of our repairs ?

24:20.335 --> 24:24.047
Impulse and warp engines are nominal.
Hull plating is at 82%.

24:24.047 --> 24:24.923
Weapons ?

24:24.965 --> 24:28.343
Mr. Reed reports the anomaly caused
more damage than he originally estimated.

24:28.343 --> 24:31.346
- How long?
- He isn't certain. Perhaps two days.

24:32.306 --> 24:35.350
If they are here to test that thing,
we may not have two days.

24:36.226 --> 24:37.561
Why the urgency ?

24:37.603 --> 24:40.314
This can't be the final version of the weapon.

24:40.314 --> 24:44.109
T'Pol's analysis shows it isn't powerful
enough to destroy an entire planet.

24:44.151 --> 24:46.320
Let them run their tests.

24:46.361 --> 24:49.823
Why destroy this prototype when we can see it in use ?

24:49.865 --> 24:51.992
Gauge its destructive power ?

24:52.034 --> 24:53.994
I don't intend to destroy it.

24:55.120 --> 24:56.914
If we could get our hands on this weapon,

24:56.955 --> 25:00.334
Starfleet might be able to figure out a defense.

25:01.418 --> 25:02.711
We're going to take it.

25:07.382 --> 25:08.967
The phase-couplers are charging.

25:09.009 --> 25:12.095
Yeah. All we have left is to reset the emitters.

25:12.137 --> 25:13.597
What's the frequency ?

25:14.765 --> 25:15.641
I'll do it.

25:17.684 --> 25:19.853
You don't trust me.

25:20.938 --> 25:23.815
No offense, but when it comes to our weapons frequencies,

25:24.775 --> 25:26.568
I wouldn't trust my own mother.

25:27.152 --> 25:29.571
Is your mother considered a security risk ?

25:29.613 --> 25:31.657
That's just an expression.

25:32.574 --> 25:34.076
An odd one.

25:34.701 --> 25:37.079
My mother's security clearance is higher than mine.

25:37.871 --> 25:39.039
Really ?

25:39.039 --> 25:41.708
She commanded an Imperial infantry unit.

25:42.709 --> 25:44.878
You come from a military family.

25:44.920 --> 25:46.588
Four generations.

25:47.840 --> 25:50.259
Three, on my father's side.

25:50.300 --> 25:52.177
He must be disappointed in you.

25:53.011 --> 25:54.054
What ?

25:55.097 --> 25:57.933
Betraying your family tradition by serving on a ship of...

25:58.892 --> 26:00.269
exploration.

26:00.269 --> 26:03.981
Actually, we haven't done much exploring for quite a while.

26:04.857 --> 26:06.650
But since you asked,

26:07.276 --> 26:08.694
he wasn't very pleased.

26:09.611 --> 26:11.446
The Royal Navy was his life.

26:13.240 --> 26:16.160
Perhaps he'd feel differently if he saw you now.

26:17.244 --> 26:19.705
Fighting for the survival of your race.

26:21.957 --> 26:23.792
I'm sure he would.

26:25.460 --> 26:29.131
Right. All done.

26:29.339 --> 26:31.216
I'll power it up and

26:32.050 --> 26:34.511
we'll see where we stand.

26:48.775 --> 26:49.776
Report.

26:49.818 --> 26:51.278
They've launched the prototype.

26:52.404 --> 26:54.281
Can we get a closer look ?

26:55.324 --> 26:56.283
This is Shran.

26:56.325 --> 26:57.409
Yes, Commander ?

26:57.409 --> 26:59.953
Transfer our sensor telemetry to Enterprise.

27:27.523 --> 27:31.360
Are these the satisfying results you promised ?

27:31.401 --> 27:34.446
{\a10}You said the moon would be destroyed !

27:35.364 --> 27:39.368
The device was building to an overload.
We were forced to shut it down.

27:39.368 --> 27:40.327
{\i1}Why ?

27:40.327 --> 27:41.161
What happened ?

27:41.203 --> 27:43.664
I need time to analyze the data.

27:43.705 --> 27:44.873
Time ?!

27:45.332 --> 27:48.126
We have given you more than enough time !

27:48.168 --> 27:52.798
We were promised a weapon to destroy
the humans in one stroke,

27:52.798 --> 27:55.384
{\i1}not peck away at them bit by bit.

27:55.425 --> 27:57.261
{\a10}He's correct, Degra.

27:57.261 --> 27:59.263
{\a10}Our patience is wearing thin.

27:59.263 --> 28:01.723
That moon was nearly split in two.

28:01.765 --> 28:03.851
Clearly, progress has been made.

28:03.892 --> 28:05.435
Not enough.

28:05.477 --> 28:08.897
Every failure puts us at risk.

28:08.939 --> 28:11.817
Degra, can the problem be rectified ?

28:11.859 --> 28:14.903
Once I've recovered the device, I'll have more information.

28:14.903 --> 28:16.572
XINDI-REPTILIAN : {\i1}We hope so !

28:19.950 --> 28:23.036
T'POL : The output was much greater than the probe
that attacked Earth.

28:23.036 --> 28:26.331
But still, I don't believe the device
reached its maximum yield.

28:26.373 --> 28:29.042
We detected power fluctuations.

28:29.084 --> 28:31.336
It appears it was building toward an overload.

28:31.378 --> 28:35.132
Are you saying this was a failure ?

28:35.174 --> 28:37.718
A spectacular one, but yes.

28:37.759 --> 28:39.386
( chuckles )

28:41.597 --> 28:43.056
Gralik...

28:45.142 --> 28:48.145
an arboreal Xindi we met at a facility that manufactured

28:48.187 --> 28:50.564
one of the components for the weapon,

28:50.564 --> 28:52.482
he promised to help us.

28:53.525 --> 28:55.736
Looks like he kept his word.

28:58.238 --> 29:00.657
Why haven't they retrieved it ?

29:00.657 --> 29:02.743
It's still emitting high levels of radiation.

29:03.660 --> 29:05.913
How long till it's safe enough to get close ?

29:05.954 --> 29:08.207
Six hours at least.

29:08.207 --> 29:10.167
We've got to get to it before they do.

29:11.710 --> 29:14.713
What if we shield the launch bay ?

29:14.755 --> 29:17.883
Evacuate all the adjacent compartments ?

29:17.925 --> 29:20.511
Could we bring it aboard any sooner ?

29:20.552 --> 29:23.597
Our shielding wouldn't be sufficient to protect the crew.

29:24.890 --> 29:26.850
Use my ship.

29:27.935 --> 29:31.104
Our force field will contain the radiation.

29:31.104 --> 29:33.273
We'll secure the device in our cargo bay

29:33.273 --> 29:35.651
until it's safe to transfer it to Enterprise.

29:37.903 --> 29:39.279
That's a generous offer.

29:40.531 --> 29:43.158
But what are we supposed to do, cheer you on ?

29:43.158 --> 29:46.829
It's four against two, remember ?

29:48.997 --> 29:50.874
This would be a joint venture.

29:53.210 --> 29:55.170
Archer to Lieutenant Reed.

29:55.212 --> 29:56.421
Reed here, sir.

29:56.463 --> 29:58.006
{\i1}What's the status on weapons ?

29:58.048 --> 30:01.385
Torpedoes are back online, and thanks to Lieutenant Talas,

30:01.426 --> 30:04.096
we should have phase-cannons within the hour.

30:04.137 --> 30:06.139
{\i1}We're going to need them.
Archer out.

30:06.139 --> 30:08.016
I wish we had more time.

30:08.058 --> 30:11.937
You're only going to get 94% efficiency
from the phase-cannons.

30:11.979 --> 30:14.189
I've never gotten above 93.

30:15.107 --> 30:18.110
If you ever decide to leave the Imperial Guard,

30:18.110 --> 30:21.196
Starfleet could certainly use you.

30:22.030 --> 30:26.243
And if you get tired of exploring,
you'd do well in the Imperial Guard.

30:28.412 --> 30:30.497
I appreciate your offer, Shran.

30:31.456 --> 30:33.667
We accept.

30:34.751 --> 30:36.420
I'll return to my ship.

30:37.546 --> 30:39.047
I'm going with you.

30:39.715 --> 30:42.134
I plan to be there when you bring the weapon aboard.

30:43.260 --> 30:45.304
That won't be necessary. We'll keep you informed.

30:45.304 --> 30:46.555
That's not good enough.

30:46.555 --> 30:48.140
If something goes wrong...

30:48.140 --> 30:50.934
The Kumari is a warship with a battle-tested crew.

30:50.976 --> 30:54.062
They're capable of performing their duties
without you looking over their shoulders.

30:54.062 --> 30:57.608
What happened to this being a joint venture ?

30:57.649 --> 31:02.321
We'll render whatever assistance we can,
but my crew won't take orders from you.

31:02.321 --> 31:03.989
They're going to have to.

31:04.031 --> 31:08.285
The Imperial Guard doesn't serve at your leisure,
pinkskin !

31:08.285 --> 31:09.620
This is my mission !

31:09.620 --> 31:13.457
And you pass up your best chance for success
over a matter of pride ?!

31:13.499 --> 31:14.541
This isn't about pride.

31:14.583 --> 31:17.211
The Xindi killed seven million humans, not Andorians.

31:18.253 --> 31:21.840
I won't put the fate of my people
in the hands of the Imperial Guard.

31:23.091 --> 31:24.676
Now, we could use your help,

31:24.718 --> 31:28.222
but if you're not happy with me calling the shots,

31:28.263 --> 31:30.390
then we'll go it alone.

31:36.313 --> 31:39.858
{\i1}I've seen the scans you've transmitted, Commander.
Impressive.

31:39.858 --> 31:42.694
Archer's science officer believes the weapon is unstable.

31:42.736 --> 31:43.946
It nearly overloaded.

31:44.279 --> 31:45.531
{\i1}The Vulcan ?

31:45.572 --> 31:48.283
I have no reason to doubt her assessment.
She seems...

31:49.243 --> 31:50.285
competent.

31:50.285 --> 31:53.330
{\i1}We'll review her data. Proceed as planned.

31:53.330 --> 31:56.375
General, the humans may yet become valuable allies.

31:56.416 --> 32:00.045
{\i1}If your mission is successful,
we won't need an alliance with them

32:00.087 --> 32:01.421
{\i1}or anyone.

32:01.421 --> 32:05.801
Why squander the opportunity ?
Is this mission worth making enemies of them ?

32:05.843 --> 32:09.346
{\i1}It's not up to you to determine the value
of this mission, Commander.

32:09.388 --> 32:14.393
{\i1}I trust your regard for this pinkskin
won't cause you to forget that.

32:21.024 --> 32:22.025
What are you doing ?

32:22.860 --> 32:25.779
Why are you accessing the sensors ? They weren't damaged.

32:25.821 --> 32:27.781
Not by the anomaly.

32:27.781 --> 32:29.700
With all the bypasses we've been running,

32:29.700 --> 32:32.119
we obviously could have created some additional problems.

32:32.161 --> 32:34.079
You're just being thorough ?

32:34.121 --> 32:36.123
You wouldn't want to be in a battle with the Xindi

32:36.165 --> 32:38.584
and suddenly find yourself flying blind.

32:38.584 --> 32:39.751
Hmm.

32:39.793 --> 32:43.463
So anything we need to worry about ?

32:43.505 --> 32:47.176
Your lateral array was out of alignment. I corrected it.

32:47.217 --> 32:49.094
All other systems are functioning properly.

32:50.179 --> 32:52.639
I'd take this ship into combat myself.

32:52.681 --> 32:54.892
Even with our primitive weapons ?

32:54.892 --> 32:58.645
It's not the weapon. It's the soldier who wields it.

33:05.736 --> 33:06.737
What is it ?

33:06.737 --> 33:09.239
- A ship.
- The Andorians ?

33:09.239 --> 33:11.617
No. The bio-signs are human.

33:12.618 --> 33:14.495
Send the escort ships to intercept.

33:14.536 --> 33:16.747
We have to keep them away from the weapon.

33:22.628 --> 33:24.213
Two Xindi ships approaching.

33:24.254 --> 33:25.839
Tactical alert.

33:26.924 --> 33:29.468
- Evasive maneuvers, Ensign.
- Aye.

33:29.510 --> 33:31.220
Hail the captain.

33:32.179 --> 33:35.224
{\i1}The two reptilian ships are moving toward us.

33:35.265 --> 33:37.434
{\i1}The other vessels are holding position.

33:37.434 --> 33:40.187
- Try to keep them busy.
{\i1}- Acknowledged.

33:40.229 --> 33:42.814
I await your orders.

33:44.816 --> 33:46.401
Let's go get it.

33:46.401 --> 33:48.695
Charge weapons and set a course.

33:56.453 --> 33:57.412
Another vessel.

33:57.412 --> 33:59.873
It's the Andorian ship. They're heading for the weapon.

33:59.873 --> 34:03.460
They're working together. Get our ships back here now !

34:12.135 --> 34:13.344
Hull plating's holding.

34:13.344 --> 34:15.848
Return fire. Target their engines.

34:19.434 --> 34:21.937
- They're breaking off.
- They're heading back into the system.

34:21.978 --> 34:25.940
Pursue course, Ensign. Continue firing all weapons.

34:32.906 --> 34:34.074
We have it.

34:34.783 --> 34:37.161
Take us out of the system, maximum speed.

34:45.418 --> 34:47.337
- Are they following ?
- No.

34:47.379 --> 34:50.299
The human vessel disabled main propulsion on both ships.

34:50.299 --> 34:52.926
- What about Enterprise ?
- They've gone to warp.

34:52.967 --> 34:55.053
No apparent damage.

34:55.053 --> 34:58.390
Contact T'Pol. Have her meet us at the rendezvous point.

35:02.644 --> 35:04.188
Is there a problem ?

35:04.229 --> 35:06.857
Inform the Imperial Guard we have the weapon.

35:07.649 --> 35:10.611
Set a course for Andoria. Maximum warp.

35:11.195 --> 35:12.613
What are you doing ?

35:14.698 --> 35:17.826
I'm afraid we won't be taking orders from you any longer.

35:19.036 --> 35:22.623
Now I see why you generously offered to let us use your ship.

35:23.707 --> 35:25.918
You son of a bitch.

35:25.959 --> 35:31.089
I was ordered to retrieve the weapon,
by whatever means necessary.

35:31.131 --> 35:33.592
I'm starting to think the Vulcans may be right about you.

35:33.592 --> 35:36.845
- The Vulcans are the reason we're doing this.
- What are you talking about ?

35:36.845 --> 35:40.724
For 200 years all that's kept them from invading Andoria

35:40.724 --> 35:42.976
is the threat of massive retaliation.

35:42.976 --> 35:45.896
With a weapon of this magnitude at our disposal,
they wouldn't dare attack us.

35:45.896 --> 35:49.942
You're putting Earth at risk
because of a border dispute with the Vulcans ?

35:49.983 --> 35:52.402
We disrupted the Xindi test, took their weapon.

35:52.402 --> 35:54.738
We may have helped save your world.

35:54.738 --> 35:57.991
I guess I'm not familiar with the Andorian concept of help.

35:59.159 --> 36:01.995
I don't need to justify my actions to you, pinkskin.

36:02.037 --> 36:05.457
I swore an oath to the Imperial Guard.
My loyalty lies with them.

36:05.457 --> 36:07.918
My crew won't let you take the weapon without a fight.

36:07.918 --> 36:10.379
Your ship isn't fast enough to catch us.

36:12.965 --> 36:15.217
You'll have to slow down to pass back
through the anomaly field.

36:15.217 --> 36:17.010
I anticipated that.

36:17.052 --> 36:21.348
When Talas was working on Enterprise
she disrupted the main sensor array.

36:21.390 --> 36:23.058
They may be able to catch up to us,

36:23.100 --> 36:25.435
but they'll have no way to find us.

36:25.477 --> 36:27.396
( grunting )

36:29.189 --> 36:31.066
You like to talk about repaying debts.

36:31.108 --> 36:33.735
I've owed you that for a long time.

36:33.777 --> 36:36.697
Take the captain to an escape pod.

36:36.697 --> 36:38.407
Don't worry.

36:38.407 --> 36:41.410
We'll alert Enterprise where to find you.

37:04.892 --> 37:07.769
T'POL : We disabled main power on both Reptilian ships.

37:07.811 --> 37:09.521
The other vessels aren't pursuing us.

37:09.521 --> 37:11.648
- What about our sensors ?
- Back on line.

37:11.648 --> 37:14.818
You were right, sir. If I hadn't been watching
that Andorian officer,

37:14.818 --> 37:17.362
it might have taken weeks to find out
where she sabotaged the array.

37:17.362 --> 37:19.656
- Their ship ?
- It's approaching the anomaly field.

37:19.698 --> 37:22.451
They reduced speed.
We'll intercept them in 14 minutes.

37:22.451 --> 37:24.661
We've begun examining the weapon.

37:24.703 --> 37:27.623
{\i1}Excellent work.
I'll see that you receive a commendation.

37:27.623 --> 37:30.834
With respect, General, I'd prefer you didn't.

37:30.876 --> 37:34.213
{\i1}Transmit your analysis as soon as possible.

37:36.882 --> 37:38.383
TALAS : {\i1}Commander Shran.

37:39.551 --> 37:42.554
- What is it ?
{\i1}- Enterprise is approaching.

37:47.851 --> 37:50.437
- Where are they ?
- 80,000 kilometers.

37:50.812 --> 37:52.481
They're hailing us.

37:55.359 --> 37:59.071
Captain Archer.
I'm glad to see you made it back safely.

37:59.071 --> 38:01.240
How did you find us ?

38:01.281 --> 38:05.077
{\i1}You don't think I'd let your people work
on my ship without appropriate supervision.

38:06.286 --> 38:08.372
{\i1}Give us the weapon.

38:08.413 --> 38:10.791
I respect your perseverance,

38:10.833 --> 38:13.877
but you don't actually think you'll be able
to take it from us ?

38:13.877 --> 38:14.962
{\i1}No.

38:14.962 --> 38:17.130
{\i1}I think you're going to give it to us.

38:17.130 --> 38:18.423
{\i1}Willingly.

38:18.465 --> 38:19.675
( chuckles )

38:19.675 --> 38:21.385
I should have warned you.

38:21.385 --> 38:24.429
Don't drink too much of that Andorian ale in one sitting.

38:24.471 --> 38:27.808
{\i1}You tossed me overboard
before I had chance to thank you

38:27.850 --> 38:30.644
{\i1}for letting us access your sensor telemetry.

38:30.686 --> 38:35.190
{\i1}When the Xindi tested the weapon,
we were able to intercept their activation codes.

38:37.401 --> 38:38.986
{\i1}Give it to us.

38:40.028 --> 38:42.948
{\i1}Or we'll detonate it in your cargo bay.

38:44.074 --> 38:45.576
You'll lose your prize.

38:45.617 --> 38:48.829
{\i1}I'd rather do that
then let you take it back to Andoria.

38:48.829 --> 38:50.372
Why ? We're not your enemy.

38:50.372 --> 38:53.125
{\i1}I can't take the chance
that you'd use it against the Vulcans.

38:53.125 --> 38:55.836
What have the Vulcans done to deserve your loyalty ?

38:55.878 --> 38:58.046
{\i1}You said you came to help us, Shran.

38:58.693 --> 39:00.757
{\i1}You can still make good on your offer.

39:01.110 --> 39:03.454
I'm sorry, pinkskin.

39:03.478 --> 39:06.138
{\i1}You're not giving me any choice.

39:07.383 --> 39:10.563
I don't believe you.

39:12.054 --> 39:14.434
Take us into the anomaly field.

39:14.458 --> 39:15.908
{\i1}T'Pol.

39:27.312 --> 39:30.533
Shran to Cargo Hold Three.
What's your status ?

39:30.557 --> 39:32.554
{\i1}The firing matrix has activated.

39:32.578 --> 39:34.296
{\i1}I believe the device is arming itself.

39:34.320 --> 39:36.746
- Shut it down !
{\i1}- We're trying, Commander.

39:36.770 --> 39:38.997
{\i1}I'd get rid of it while you still can.

39:39.021 --> 39:40.424
Report !

39:41.198 --> 39:43.345
They have less than 30 seconds.

39:47.602 --> 39:49.368
Shran...

39:50.125 --> 39:52.006
T'POL : {\i1}20 seconds.

39:53.893 --> 39:57.198
Clear the hold.
Prepare to open the bay doors.

40:03.196 --> 40:04.478
Six seconds.

40:04.502 --> 40:07.042
- Let's get moving.
- Already on it, sir.

40:19.202 --> 40:20.708
No damage, sir.

40:21.693 --> 40:22.898
The Andorians ?

40:23.766 --> 40:25.287
They were much closer than we were.

40:25.311 --> 40:29.603
Their hull's intact, but there's significant
damage to their engines and power systems.

40:32.479 --> 40:34.153
Open a channel to Shran.

40:35.834 --> 40:39.544
Ask him if he requires our assistance.

40:41.856 --> 40:43.859
ARCHER : {\i1}Captain's Starlog,
supplemental.

40:43.883 --> 40:48.005
{\i1}Commander Shran graciously declined our offer of help.

40:48.029 --> 40:52.847
{\i1}The last we saw of them,
they were limping away on auxiliary power.

40:57.680 --> 40:59.607
You have something ?

40:59.631 --> 41:03.659
SATO : Just before we went to warp,
we received a transmission from the Andorian ship.

41:03.683 --> 41:06.401
It wasn't on one of their normal com frequencies.

41:06.425 --> 41:09.597
It was encrypted to look like subspace interference.

41:09.621 --> 41:11.351
Let's see it.

41:11.375 --> 41:15.751
Apparently, they had time to take some detailed scans
while it was aboard their ship.

41:15.775 --> 41:19.111
Judging from the clandestine nature of the transmission,

41:19.135 --> 41:22.252
I'd guess that whoever sent this
didn't want to be discovered.

41:23.790 --> 41:26.684
Get it to Starfleet Command right away.

41:30.152 --> 41:33.073
Why don't you and Trip join me for dinner tonight ?

41:33.097 --> 41:37.538
I have some Andorian ale you might like to try.
