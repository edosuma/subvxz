Right. | also DVR'd last
week's numbers announcement.

Following. So when
we play Max the clip,

00:17.643 --> 00:19.133
he'll think he won
and flip out.

00:19.436 --> 00:20.551
It's the perfect prank.
You got it?

00:20.854 --> 00:22.595
Yeah. Sure, buddy,
| got it.

00:22.898 --> 00:24.980
Max is gonna win the lottery last
week. (WHISPERS) Pass it on.

00:25.275 --> 00:27.687
Are you sure Max isn't gonna
freak out? This sounds a little mean.

00:27.986 --> 00:29.818
Aw! Isn't he adorable?

00:30.113 --> 00:31.399
You're my little... And
this is a working nickname,

Ugh. We get it.
Ya like each other.

Pete, you son of a bitch, you're
as innocent as you are stunning.

00:39.790 --> 00:41.497
Max deserves this.
He pranks us all the time.

00:41.792 --> 00:42.998
He got me just yesterday.

00:43.293 --> 00:44.658
Here you go, bud.

my yoga mat?

01:03.397 --> 01:04.808
And my welcome mat?
And my neighbor Matt?

01:05.107 --> 01:06.518
Or when he hacked
my ancestry account

01:06.817 --> 01:08.728
and convinced me that I was
the third Williams sister.

01:09.027 --> 01:10.813

he decimated our 401(k).

a giant hole in the floor.

But do not try to put
your feet through and run.

01:34.261 --> 01:35.922
Why don't we just check
the results online, Grandpa?

01:36.221 --> 01:37.711
Good point, Max.
Let's do that.

01:38.015 --> 01:39.972
Never mind. This way is

02:37.741 --> 02:40.654
(SIGHS) We pranked you.
Those were last week's numbers.

SO passionate.

to escape the wrath

(IN NORMAL VOICE) What?

03:06.478 --> 03:08.435
Damn it. Max Blum.

03:08.730 --> 03:10.437
How'd I mess up
my own name?

03:10.732 --> 03:12.473
(IN RASPY VOICE) It's your
fault, and now I'm embarrassed,

03:12.776 --> 03:14.312
and I will revenge on
all of you even harder!

03:19.366 --> 03:20.151
Did we mess up?

03:31.253 --> 03:32.960
And that is why I keep
two separate journals,

03:33.255 --> 03:35.121
one for waking Dave
and one for dreaming Dave.

03:35.424 --> 03:37.665
You see, REM sleep...
(SCREAMS)

03:37.968 --> 03:40.551
Max, don't hurt me! Ow! Ow! What
did I tell you about screaming like that?

03:43.432 --> 03:44.843
I'm sorry, Pen,
but Pete was right.

03:45.142 --> 03:46.553
Our prank was too mean.

03:46.852 --> 03:48.513
Max is gonna get us,
and I'm flipping out.

03:48.812 --> 03:51.304
You should be flippin' out.
That's right.

03:51.606 --> 03:53.768
Max put stripper glitter
in my two favorite things,

03:54.067 --> 03:55.808
my lotions
and my creams.

03:56.111 --> 03:59.024
That's why we're late. We figured,
why not take advantage of the situation?

03:59.322 --> 04:01.859
(RAP MUSIC PLAYING) Bring
the guns out. Bring the guns out.

04:05.162 --> 04:07.620
(SIGHS) Actually, I'm glad
my prank's out of the way,

clean themself up

04:09.583 --> 04:11.244

some job interviews.

04:11.543 --> 04:14.251
Yep. My sabbradical
is officially over

04:14.546 --> 04:16.753

into the world of high finance.

Brad, I hope
you get this job

04:24.055 --> 04:26.763

distraction from Max's revenge spree.

04:27.058 --> 04:28.548
Well, this little piggy,
for one, is not worried

04:28.852 --> 04:31.765

one step ahead of him.

Nope.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.408
Why can't I get
my name right?

04:52.626 --> 04:53.707
And that is why
my addiction to working late

04:54.002 --> 04:56.619

not a weakness.

09:30.653 --> 09:33.896
Oh. Okay. I see
what's happening here.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.281
You bombed a few interviews,
you freaked,

09:36.576 --> 09:38.283
and you took the first thing
that came along.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.785
Classic Brad panic move,
just like when 9/11 happened

09:41.081 --> 09:42.446
and you full-on supported
the war in Iraq.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.205
We were lied to!
Mmm.

09:44.501 --> 09:47.289
And this isn't a panic
move, Jane. | like this job.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.624
Brad, you have an MBA.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.585
There's no way you like
working at Fartles & James.

09:52.884 --> 09:54.420
That's not the name. So
here's what you're gonna do.

09:54.719 --> 09:55.800
You're gonna call 'em up
and you're gonna tell them

09:56.096 --> 09:56.927
you made a mistake,
and then you're gonna go out

09:57.222 --> 09:58.303
and get a job
that you really want.

10:07.857 --> 10:09.973
J Stetson's got
a profession! J

10:10.276 --> 10:11.812
In this scenario,
Dirk and Stetson are both me.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.853
Still makes no sense.

10:14.155 --> 10:16.897
So Brad got a job.
That's great.

10:17.200 --> 10:20.568
Great? Really? What else is
great? Syphilis? Men with bangs?

10:20.870 --> 10:22.827
Waking up with a dead dog
in your damn bed?

10:23.123 --> 10:25.080
If I had known that dog was
gonna climb in bed with me,

10:25.375 --> 10:27.537
| never would've had
so much chocolate in there.

10:27.836 --> 10:30.248
Um, Penny?

10:30.547 --> 10:34.040
(SCOFFS) Why would my housekeeper
drag dying flowers across my floor?

Oh, my God. Oh, my
God. Where's Pete?

10:51.734 --> 10:53.350

achy calves feel all better,

Okay, well, if you're not
working with Max,

on the couch?

11:31.649 --> 11:33.310
Fine. (CHUCKLES)

11:33.610 --> 11:35.226
Don't know why you're
being so weird.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.960
Al, look at yourself.
This is getting ridiculous.

11:58.259 --> 11:59.920
You don't have to join Max.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.382
We can prank him,
beat him at his own game.

12:02.680 --> 12:03.920
We'll give him a shot
at pre-vengeance,

12:04.224 --> 12:05.385

of pre-taliation,

a load of pre-comeuppance.

someone got him back

Also, it's gonna
burn a lot.

that is a prank | am not familiar with.

Now, I snuck into Max's limo
and rigged 12 hot plates

17:08.694 --> 17:11.356
and a ton of popcorn bags
to the ignition.

17:11.656 --> 17:14.318

It's gettin' better.
Yeah, he's right, Al.

18:49.754 --> 18:52.121
He got us all good.
Even stunning Pete.

18:52.423 --> 18:55.961
Oh! Pete! Where the hell were
ya? You missed my best prank!

18:56.260 --> 18:57.876
You glued me
to the toilet, Max.

18:58.179 --> 18:59.260
(LAUGHS) Right!

19:01.307 --> 19:03.048
Don't you have something
nice to ask Penny?

19:03.351 --> 19:05.058
ALEX: What?

19:05.353 --> 19:07.344
This is not, um, how I
envisioned this happening,

19:09.023 --> 19:10.764
but...
Oh, wait. Um...

19:12.443 --> 19:14.229
You need this?
Thank you.

19:14.528 --> 19:15.689
| really love it, by the way.
Okay. (CHUCKLES) You're good.

19:19.033 --> 19:22.526
Penny, I love
everything about you.

19:22.828 --> 19:25.786
| love your big heart and I
love your even bigger head.

19:26.082 --> 19:28.369
Aw. | love how last night,
when the waiter asked,

19:28.668 --> 19:31.456
"Do you want a doggie bag?"
You didn't just say no.

19:31.754 --> 19:34.337
You lied and told him we were
going on a three-week Alaskan cruise.

19:34.632 --> 19:35.212
Well, I didn't want him to
think I didn't like the food.

19:35.966 --> 19:38.583
| kKnow.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.627
You always surprise me, and I want
you to surprise me for the rest of my life.

19:42.640 --> 19:43.880
| know it's quick,
but once you know, you know.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.517
Penny Hartz, will
you marry me? Yes!

19:49.438 --> 19:51.429
(CHEERING AND LAUGHING)

19:51.732 --> 19:52.972
ALEX: Yay, girl!

19:55.194 --> 19:56.309
(GASPS)
(POPCORN POPPING)

19:56.612 --> 19:57.568
(EXCLAIMING)

19:57.863 --> 19:59.945
It's so pretty!

20:00.241 --> 20:01.322
I'm crying and I don't
care who knows it.

20:03.244 --> 20:04.655
It works!
It really works!

20:04.954 --> 20:06.160
(ALL LAUGHING)

20:10.710 --> 20:12.451
Classic couple of days, guys.

20:12.753 --> 20:13.333
Mmm-hmm.
One last toast.

20:14.338 --> 20:15.920
To Penny and Pete.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.671
To the most romantic
engagement

20:17.967 --> 20:20.208
ever to take place
within 20 feet of a car fire.

20:20.511 --> 20:21.672
(SIGHS) Well, I have to go
lock up the store.

20:21.971 --> 20:24.303
See you guys later.

20:24.598 --> 20:26.589
So, not to divert attention
from my hard-core eternal love,

20:26.892 --> 20:28.178
but, Max,
| gotta hand it to you,

20:28.477 --> 20:29.808
you outdid yourself
on those pranks.

20:30.104 --> 20:31.845
Ah, thank you,
but I couldn't have done it

20:32.148 --> 20:33.388
without Dave starting
this whole thing.

20:33.691 --> 20:34.726
Well, technically,
you started it

20:35.025 --> 20:35.730
with the whole
"subs 4 guns" thing.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.147
What "subs 4 guns” thing?

20:39.447 --> 20:40.812
Hold the pickles.

20:41.115 --> 20:42.856
If you didn't do
the gun thing, who did?

20:43.159 --> 20:44.524
This fax came for
you guys. A fax?

20:46.787 --> 20:48.744
What in the Wyclef Jean
is this?

20:51.167 --> 20:52.749
Is this Alex?

20:53.043 --> 20:54.204
Wait. Alex was behind
this whole thing?

20:54.503 --> 20:57.666
No way. No way in hell.

20:57.965 --> 21:00.047
She got the worst of it. She
cut her hair, she hurt her leg.

21:00.342 --> 21:01.377
Yeah, it couldn't have
been her. Of course not.

21:01.677 --> 21:02.417
Alex?
Our Alex?

21:02.720 --> 21:03.209
She dumb as hell.

21:28.162 --> 21:29.448
ALEX: I'm not as dumb as I am.

21:38.130 --> 21:38.210
<i>I
I</i>
