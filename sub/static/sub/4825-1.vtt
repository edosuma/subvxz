00:43.377 --> 00:47.513
March 24, 2008.

00:49.050 --> 00:50.616
A little boy was born.

00:52.953 --> 00:55.788
Sincere Israel Najir Grant.

00:59.093 --> 01:00.692
My son.

01:13.474 --> 01:15.207
That's my son.

01:16.777 --> 01:18.343
You know where I was?

01:19.713 --> 01:21.480
Nah, not the hospital bed.

01:23.017 --> 01:24.683
Nah, not in the waiting room.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.487
I was locked the fuck up.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.297
Remember getting that call.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.732
Putting the call in,
I should say.

01:45.873 --> 01:47.706
Had a beautiful baby boy,

01:47.708 --> 01:51.076
and I wasn't there to greet him when
he came into the world, and, um...

01:51.078 --> 01:52.711
It's funny.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.581
I was released the week after.

01:57.451 --> 02:00.652
April 1. My pop's birthday.

02:00.654 --> 02:03.489
Came home on April Fool's Day.
Dig that.

02:09.497 --> 02:12.498
I remember walking in,
opening the P's.

02:12.500 --> 02:16.502
Everybody...
"Yo, Primo, Primo. Oh, shit."

02:16.504 --> 02:19.671
Fuck y'all.
I want to go see my son.

02:24.011 --> 02:25.878
Walked up the stairs.
I was nervous.

02:27.515 --> 02:29.548
Haven't seen my daughter
in so long.

02:32.953 --> 02:35.087
Open the door.
Everybody greeting me.

02:35.089 --> 02:37.890
"Oh, welcome home.
Welcome home."

02:37.892 --> 02:42.761
"Yeah, it's nice. That-That was sweet.
Move. I want to see my son."

02:42.763 --> 02:44.630
And I walked into the room.

02:45.733 --> 02:48.767
There's a little baby,
about this big.

02:50.237 --> 02:54.673
Just laying on the bed. Wrapped
up, blankets, sky blue hat on.

02:57.311 --> 03:00.445
And, um... "That's my son."

03:05.419 --> 03:07.419
All I kept saying was,
"That's my son."

03:10.124 --> 03:12.925
I remember my daughter
ran in the room and...

03:15.095 --> 03:16.728
"Daddy, Sincere."

03:18.632 --> 03:20.232
"Sincere, Daddy."

03:21.268 --> 03:22.801
I said, "Yes, baby."

03:24.071 --> 03:25.671
I picked my son up.

03:32.646 --> 03:35.147
I've never...

03:35.149 --> 03:37.916
I can't recall
tearing so hard in my life,

03:37.918 --> 03:39.818
even when my daughter was born.

03:41.488 --> 03:44.223
But I teared like a baby...

03:44.225 --> 03:46.992
because I missed the most
important part of my son's life,

03:46.994 --> 03:48.727
and that was his coming.

03:50.698 --> 03:55.334
And on that day, I promised
my kid... I swore to him.

03:55.336 --> 03:57.769
I swore to my son
and I swore to my daughter.

04:01.075 --> 04:02.841
"I'll never leave you again."

04:21.928 --> 04:25.009
What's good, boy? Yo.
What's good, bro?

04:27.468 --> 04:30.702
What up, yo?
Yeah. What's good, man?

04:31.839 --> 04:33.438
Yo, what's up?

04:37.845 --> 04:39.611
What's good, little man?

04:39.613 --> 04:41.933
You got a nicer ball.
You got a nicer ball.

04:49.623 --> 04:53.592
Holy shit. Well, well, well.

04:53.594 --> 04:56.361
What's good, man? What's up, man?
No pounds?

04:56.363 --> 04:57.663
I gotta go, man.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.698
Hold on, bro.
Why you moving so fast, man?

04:59.700 --> 05:01.266
I gotta go, man. I gotta go.

05:01.268 --> 05:04.603
Just chill out, bro. What's good with you?
Take it easy, man.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.738
What's good, man?
Why you so nervous, man?

05:06.740 --> 05:08.206
Yo. Relax, bro.

05:08.208 --> 05:11.643
Just a few words, man. When you
gonna start moving it for me, man?

05:11.645 --> 05:13.912
I don't want to do nothing
for you, man.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.681
I'm good. I'm good, man.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.683
Watch your tone, bitch.
This nigga's a big shot.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.318
What you mean you good, man?
Shit, man.

05:19.320 --> 05:21.553
This nigga's a big shot now.
What's up, man?

05:21.555 --> 05:24.323
Filling up your pockets?
You good? You eating?

05:24.325 --> 05:26.825
Yo, John!

05:26.827 --> 05:29.594
If it ain't the moneymaking RayLo.
Big Primo.

05:29.596 --> 05:31.496
RayLo. What's good, boy?
Ain't nothing, man. Macking.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.031
What you doing
with my young 'un?

05:33.033 --> 05:34.866
Just saw him passing
through, chop it up with him.

05:34.868 --> 05:36.435
You good? I'm chilling.

05:36.437 --> 05:39.271
Just about to spin off, man.
It's hot as a bitch out here.

05:39.273 --> 05:41.673
RayLo, make sure the numbers right.
I'm-a holla at you.

05:41.675 --> 05:42.974
A'ight.

05:42.976 --> 05:45.477
Where you been, man? I ain't
seen you since the funeral.

05:45.479 --> 05:48.347
Chilling, bro. You gotta
come out more often, man.

05:48.349 --> 05:50.882
Staying in the house. Shit ain't
as depressing as it looks.

05:50.884 --> 05:54.686
Yeah, I'm stuck in the crib, man.
Well, come back out.

05:54.688 --> 05:57.289
There's a lot more
on the streets.

05:57.291 --> 05:58.924
I'm sorry about
your old man, though.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.559
Yo, I appreciate that, man.
No problem, man.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.627
Yeah, man.
Sorry about your old man.

06:02.629 --> 06:05.797
Y'all knew my pops? Yeah, yo.
He was a good dude.

06:05.799 --> 06:09.034
Mel was the best, you know what I mean?
Everybody knew your pops.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.769
Respect. Remember that.

06:10.771 --> 06:13.171
But I got you here now, so...

06:13.173 --> 06:16.675
Got some kicks on. Let's see
how your ball game looking.

06:16.677 --> 06:19.678
Bet it's better than yours.
Mmm.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.321
- Check.
- You know it.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.852
- Don't lose your breath.
- 1-zip.

06:28.355 --> 06:30.636
Check up, bitch.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.858
Why you fouling for?
Don't start crying.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.526
Why you fouling for?
Stop crying.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.561
Why you fouling? Stop crying.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.031
- My point.
- Your push.

06:40.033 --> 06:42.674
My point. Now you playing
like a little man.

06:44.438 --> 06:46.104
You're just a hacker, yo.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.439
Come on, man. Let's play ball.

06:47.441 --> 06:49.282
Put your fucking hands up.
Let's play ball.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.109
It's my ball. Catch up.

06:52.479 --> 06:56.047
Game over! Let's go!

06:56.049 --> 06:57.616
'Bout time.

06:58.652 --> 07:01.420
How's your moms, man?
She's good.

07:01.422 --> 07:03.255
How's she hanging in there?

07:03.257 --> 07:04.790
She's living. You know.

07:05.692 --> 07:08.360
We gonna make sure
she lives great.

07:08.362 --> 07:11.863
You gonna make sure of that. You
gonna make sure and be the man.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.945
Of course, man.
The man of the house.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.768
All this nonsense out here
in the streets, J.

07:17.471 --> 07:19.037
It ain't for you.

07:21.241 --> 07:23.108
Real money.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.210
What you got in mind?

07:25.212 --> 07:28.480
Got a lot of things in mind, but
I know what I want you to do.

07:28.482 --> 07:32.851
I mean, like...
I owe it to your pops, man.

07:32.853 --> 07:35.054
Yo, come on, man. Don't play
me like no little kid, man.

07:35.055 --> 07:38.990
Relax. Nobody playing you
like a kid, John.

07:38.992 --> 07:42.327
Your pops took me in
at the same age you is,

07:42.329 --> 07:43.995
showed me everything
I need to know.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.998
Understand?
Respected by everybody.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.803
Bloods, Crips,
Kings, Ã‘etas, everybody.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.772
And he was a neutral dude.

07:53.774 --> 07:55.607
You know why?
'Cause he gave respect.

07:55.609 --> 07:57.809
He had power,
but he never abused it.

07:58.512 --> 07:59.578
Understand? Yeah.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.112
He took me in, five hard.

08:02.549 --> 08:04.382
Didn't discriminate
against me or nothing.

08:04.384 --> 08:06.218
Taught me
everything I need to know.

08:07.855 --> 08:10.489
I mean, this works out for you
and you comfy,

08:10.491 --> 08:12.691
which I'm sure you will be,

08:12.693 --> 08:14.826
bring it to the home team,
know what I mean?

08:14.828 --> 08:17.929
Get the one-eyed willy and do
one of these a little bit.

08:17.931 --> 08:20.572
All right? You offering
me to be Blood, man?

08:21.101 --> 08:23.134
It's a offer, but...

08:23.136 --> 08:25.971
Don't think you gotta do what the
rest of these dudes gotta do.

08:26.773 --> 08:28.807
Me, I take care of that.

08:28.809 --> 08:31.209
You ain't gotta go
buck 50 no grills.

08:31.211 --> 08:32.910
Steal no cars or some shit.

08:32.913 --> 08:35.413
Know what I mean?
I'll bless you in.

08:35.414 --> 08:37.616
I'm a five star.
They don't question me.

08:37.618 --> 08:41.219
Say the word right now,
I'll put it in the books.

08:41.221 --> 08:44.656
When you walk outside tomorrow
morning, or even in the next hour,

08:44.658 --> 08:46.258
all the fuckers
is gonna salute you.

08:46.260 --> 08:47.826
What's a five star?

08:49.897 --> 08:52.030
Never thought I had to explain
it to you, know what I mean?

08:52.032 --> 08:53.999
Always thought Mel
would be here to tell you.

08:57.604 --> 08:59.905
Five lanes, baby.

08:59.907 --> 09:04.075
First five to ever start
this whole Blood Piru game.

09:04.077 --> 09:05.210
I mean...

09:06.580 --> 09:09.614
It goes deeper than what
you see on the TV.

09:10.384 --> 09:13.485
Right now, what you read...

09:13.487 --> 09:15.287
got Bloods and Crips
fighting over this.

09:16.623 --> 09:18.723
Five stars, we don't
gotta fight over that.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.725
Understand? We generals.
We salute everything.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.294
We done bossed up.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.196
Everybody answers to me.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.866
Shit don't go down
unless it goes through me.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.901
Before it was me,
it was me and your pops.

09:31.305 --> 09:35.006
I love him to death, but what
he taught me, I'm gonna use.

09:36.043 --> 09:38.910
I'm-a do for you
what was done for me.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.272
Put you under the wing. You ain't
gotta worry about nothing.

09:42.282 --> 09:43.815
Know what I mean?

09:43.817 --> 09:45.350
You ready to come home?

10:05.806 --> 10:08.047
You really think
that was a stray bullet?

10:11.478 --> 10:12.944
Uh...

10:13.780 --> 10:16.748
I mean,
you gotta remember, son.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.516
The streets are talking.
The streets are evil.

10:18.518 --> 10:20.552
You feel me? Like...

10:20.554 --> 10:22.487
People are negative.

10:22.489 --> 10:25.924
People were envious of the respect
he had, 'cause he had it.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.425
You feel me? Like,
niggas would be, like...

10:27.427 --> 10:29.327
"Yo, why he got all that for?"

10:29.329 --> 10:30.862
"What about me? What I got?"

10:32.733 --> 10:34.566
Hold on one sec.

10:34.568 --> 10:36.101
Hello?

10:37.170 --> 10:38.770
What's good?

10:40.273 --> 10:41.406
What?

10:43.677 --> 10:45.243
You can't handle that?

10:48.015 --> 10:50.135
So you want me to come
all the way over there?

10:51.952 --> 10:53.992
All right. I'll be there
in 15 minutes, man.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.389
Fifteen minutes, man.

10:59.526 --> 11:02.460
Look, man,
I make a rule real quick.

11:02.462 --> 11:04.796
Swing by the crib,
we'll chop it up.

11:04.798 --> 11:07.198
I mean talk a little more.
All right.

11:41.568 --> 11:43.635
Look like you're
having a party right now.

11:43.637 --> 11:45.704
We just sitting, chilling, man.

11:45.706 --> 11:48.740
You got a problem.
What's the problem?

11:48.742 --> 11:51.176
I'm here. I know you're here.

11:51.178 --> 11:54.145
- Damn.
- Want my money. That's what's up, like...

11:54.147 --> 11:56.648
Like I said, give me two
days, and you'll have your money.

11:56.650 --> 11:58.383
Two more days.

11:58.385 --> 12:01.386
You sent your little army, squad down
here, whatever you wanna call 'em.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.222
Know what I'm saying? I sent 'em back
empty-handed, as you can see. Look at it.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.257
It's a little rough
down here, man.

12:06.259 --> 12:09.027
I mean, it's hard right now, man.
That's not my problem!

12:09.029 --> 12:10.929
Getting the package to you,
that's my problem.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.731
I get two days? Two extra days?

12:12.733 --> 12:14.332
That's all I ask for, man.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.801
Been running with you for two years, bro.
Know what I'm saying?

12:16.803 --> 12:18.903
You got it.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.438
Two days. That was rude of me.

12:20.440 --> 12:23.241
Good looking, man. Look out.
Know what I'm saying?

12:23.243 --> 12:25.603
It's just business.
That's cool.

12:26.747 --> 12:28.246
Just business.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.948
It was just business.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.751
It's just fucking business.
It's just business, right?

13:05.919 --> 13:07.819
Here. Let me do that for you.

13:07.821 --> 13:10.722
But you... You know that you...

13:10.724 --> 13:13.405
Just being in the kitchen alone
is a privilege right now.

13:15.262 --> 13:20.165
If you showed me how to do what you
do, we could be doing it together.

13:20.167 --> 13:22.600
Ew. That's why your corn
be tasting so sweet.

13:22.602 --> 13:25.170
What? Mind your business and
stay out of my damn kitchen.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.413
Maybe I need to stand in the
kitchen with you more often.

13:28.875 --> 13:31.209
You hear my secrets.

13:31.211 --> 13:32.844
If I find out
anybody's cooking like me,

13:32.846 --> 13:34.612
I'll know where
they got it from.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.614
From you.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.016
I'm not telling nobody
about that.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.884
I don't put sugar in corn.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.964
Time to eat, guys. Huh?

13:52.966 --> 13:54.567
Come on. Let's go.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.368
Come on, E'niyah. Eli?

13:58.538 --> 14:00.872
Eli?

14:00.874 --> 14:03.308
It's time to eat.
Come eat. Come eat.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.578
I'm hungry.

14:23.964 --> 14:26.431
I found it. Go
put it in the garbage.

14:31.137 --> 14:32.136
Eat.

14:32.138 --> 14:33.838
Growing up,

14:33.840 --> 14:36.841
I used to always want
to be a prima ballerina.

14:36.843 --> 14:41.512
I see myself being
somebody important...

14:41.514 --> 14:45.149
and hopefully making a
difference in someone's life.

14:45.151 --> 14:47.785
Making a
difference in whose life?

14:47.787 --> 14:49.988
I don't know.

14:49.990 --> 14:52.023
So what do you want to be?
You'll be, like, a teacher?

14:52.025 --> 14:54.726
No! I mean, maybe. I don't know.
Maybe?

14:54.728 --> 14:58.463
I don't know. I don't think
kids will like me that much.

14:58.465 --> 15:00.031
Go on. Where do
you see yourself?

15:00.033 --> 15:01.933
I don't know.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.534
Sit down.

15:09.075 --> 15:10.575
You ever been
to the zoo before?

15:11.978 --> 15:14.112
That's so random, but, no.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.481
It's just a question.
I haven't.

15:17.384 --> 15:18.850
Why not?

15:18.852 --> 15:21.753
I don't know. Because... Not even,
like, a school trip or nothing?

15:21.755 --> 15:25.356
Nothing. I mean, of course
I had chances, I guess.

15:25.358 --> 15:26.858
I just never went.

15:26.860 --> 15:29.093
Why? You were scared? No.

15:29.095 --> 15:30.895
Tell me what's up. Why not?

15:30.897 --> 15:32.330
Isn't it kind of, like,
a kid thing though?

15:32.332 --> 15:35.133
Don't little kids
go to... Hell, no.

15:35.135 --> 15:37.635
You ever seen a grizzly bear?
No.

15:37.637 --> 15:41.472
Them shits is, like, seven
feet tall, 300 pounds.

15:41.474 --> 15:44.709
Like crazy vicious, but at the same
time they're like little kittens.

15:44.711 --> 15:47.312
Mad playful and just...

15:47.314 --> 15:49.013
They're cool. You gotta see it.

15:50.717 --> 15:52.417
I would like that.

15:52.419 --> 15:54.052
So you saying I could take you?

15:54.054 --> 15:56.387
Are you asking me? Kind of.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.257
I think we could
work something out.

16:34.527 --> 16:37.929
Right on time. What's up, man?

16:37.931 --> 16:39.597
What up, boy? What's good, yo?

16:39.599 --> 16:40.798
Chillin', man. What up?

16:40.800 --> 16:42.233

16:42.235 --> 16:44.535

16:44.537 --> 16:47.205
Why you got this whole
block smelling like sh...

16:51.411 --> 16:53.077

16:53.079 --> 16:54.579

16:54.581 --> 16:57.381
Okay. Hubby life.

17:09.496 --> 17:11.162
Yo. What up?

17:29.816 --> 17:32.517
<i>[ Hip-hop ]</i>

17:34.020 --> 17:35.720
What's good, yo?

17:37.624 --> 17:40.265
You got the goons out here, yo.

17:46.299 --> 17:49.067
Good luck, son.
I'm-a holla at ya.

18:05.552 --> 18:07.151
How's the food?

18:07.854 --> 18:09.587
It's good.

18:09.589 --> 18:12.557
Even though I hate vegetables
or whatever this green stuff is.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.227
So you saw Jasmin today?

18:18.064 --> 18:19.764
How was that?

18:19.766 --> 18:22.533
Yeah. Yeah?

18:23.570 --> 18:25.570
What, Mom?
Did I teach you how to speak...

18:25.572 --> 18:27.939
so you can answer my question
with one word?

18:27.941 --> 18:30.261
She's nice, Ma. She's nice.

18:35.148 --> 18:36.747
I'm not gonna be home
tomorrow night.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.183
Where you going?

18:39.786 --> 18:41.285
I-I gotta go out.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.920
Out where? You got a date?

18:42.922 --> 18:44.555
Oh, crap.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.157
And me find out.

18:46.159 --> 18:47.992
I'm gonna go play bingo. Bingo!

18:47.994 --> 18:49.994
In Titi's house?

18:49.996 --> 18:52.864
Mm-hmm. It's Friday.

18:52.866 --> 18:55.099
You told me to get out
of the house and do something,

18:55.101 --> 18:56.667
so I'm going to play bingo
in Titi's house.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.102
Tell Titi I say hi.

18:58.104 --> 19:00.771
She was asking about you, so why
don't you go say hi yourself.

19:00.773 --> 19:03.174
I don't wanna go over there.
She annoys me.

19:05.211 --> 19:08.813
And she got those couches with the
freaking... with the plastic on it.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.414
It be sticking to my skin.

19:10.416 --> 19:12.376
I hate... I hate her house.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.087
Are you giving me
that look, like...

19:16.089 --> 19:17.655
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

19:17.657 --> 19:20.858
You know she put that plastic there
so you can protect the furniture.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.460
Yeah.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.896
She protecting the furniture
for the past, like, 40 years.

19:24.898 --> 19:26.898
But she got it for 40 years
'cause she put that plastic...

19:26.900 --> 19:29.634
She gonna protect it
for another 40 years, right?

19:29.636 --> 19:31.269
Tell her to take that shit off.

19:31.271 --> 19:33.271
Now you're getting too, like,

19:33.273 --> 19:35.006
plastic in the furniture
and shit.

19:35.008 --> 19:36.641
Come on, Ma.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.246
So...

19:42.882 --> 19:45.850
Do you know, um, about...

19:47.353 --> 19:49.253
About what? Safe sex?

19:49.255 --> 19:50.755
Come on, Ma.

19:50.757 --> 19:53.157
Don't start talking
about this stuff.

19:53.793 --> 19:56.194
So who is supposed to
talk to you about this stuff?

19:56.196 --> 19:58.596
I know about this stuff.
What do you know about?

19:58.598 --> 20:00.431
I took sex ed.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.900
Okay. What did it teach you?

20:02.902 --> 20:05.536
First of all, I learned
how to put a condom on.

20:07.207 --> 20:09.740
You know?

20:09.742 --> 20:11.876
Back in my days, you didn't
have to wear condoms, because...

20:11.878 --> 20:14.812
Oh, come on, Ma.
You'd be with just one person.

20:14.814 --> 20:17.615
And you don't be running around
with Tom, Dick and Harry.

20:17.617 --> 20:21.352
You just stay with one man, and you didn't
have to worry about condoms or no condoms.

20:21.354 --> 20:23.794
There's nothing wrong
with more than one girl.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.390
What?

20:28.394 --> 20:30.294
I did not raise you
to be a player.

20:31.030 --> 20:32.797
I raised you better than that.

20:32.799 --> 20:35.166
Come on, Ma.
I told you about respecting...

20:35.168 --> 20:36.968
I told you about
respecting a woman.

20:36.970 --> 20:38.669
I do respect women.

20:42.308 --> 20:45.343
If Jasmin comes here crying,
you're gonna get it.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.912
Ma, she's not gonna come here crying.
If Jasmin comes over here...

20:47.914 --> 20:51.749
complaining about you and telling
me that you broke her heart,

20:51.751 --> 20:53.918
you're gonna deal with me, boy.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.053
I love you, Mother.
Yeah, I love you too.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.236
The A/C is on.

21:12.238 --> 21:13.871
So why's it not working?

21:14.440 --> 21:16.007
Call the landlord.

21:17.610 --> 21:20.211
So, what, he can come get punched
in the face?

21:20.213 --> 21:21.746
Why you gonna
punch him in his face?

21:21.748 --> 21:24.415
Because he's fucking annoying
with all this bullshit.

21:24.417 --> 21:27.051
Fucking yesterday
he texted me...

21:27.053 --> 21:30.388
"Oh, if you have a problem
with paying the rent..."

21:30.390 --> 21:32.723
and you have a problem
with being there,

21:32.725 --> 21:36.060
"I'll refund you
your security deposit."

21:36.062 --> 21:38.929
Complaining... You ain't fixed the
fucking closet doors for six months.

21:38.931 --> 21:41.465
How long we waited
for the closet doors,

21:41.467 --> 21:43.734
the bathroom,
the sink was fucked up?

21:44.704 --> 21:45.870
Six months.

21:45.872 --> 21:48.606
Now you complaining
'cause of one month?

21:48.608 --> 21:51.042
And you gonna tell me
I can get my deposit back?

21:52.312 --> 21:54.712
Come bring my deposit
so I can kick your ass...

21:54.714 --> 21:56.380
all up and down
the fucking block,

21:56.382 --> 21:57.848
then ship him back
to fucking Nigeria.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.550
You can't put hands on him.
Why not?

21:59.552 --> 22:02.053
You put your hands on him
and risk him calling the police.

22:03.289 --> 22:05.356
That's why you
do the job to the T.

22:05.358 --> 22:06.991
You mean kill him? Huh?

22:06.993 --> 22:09.827
You gonna kill him?
No. Don't have to kill him.

22:09.829 --> 22:12.029
Just bust his head to a coma.

22:12.031 --> 22:13.791
Put him in a permanent sleep.

22:15.201 --> 22:18.069
That is funny, though,
because... Don't say that.

22:18.071 --> 22:19.670
Don't say it.

22:20.406 --> 22:21.872
Give me it!

22:21.874 --> 22:24.342
Give it to him
and leave him alone.

22:24.344 --> 22:27.144
What is he crying for? 'Cause he
went in there with the little stick.

22:27.146 --> 22:28.713
Give it to him.

22:30.116 --> 22:31.682
And y'all be nice.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.351
I ain't got it.
E'niyah, give it back.

22:33.353 --> 22:35.820
Give it to him. And be nice.

22:37.824 --> 22:41.459
Don't start, 'cause I'll shut
down the whole park operation,

22:41.461 --> 22:43.627
and everybody can
stay home and have naps.

22:43.629 --> 22:46.731
No, I... I put
to Elijah, because...

22:46.733 --> 22:50.134
It's supposed to be
duck, duck, duck, goose!

22:51.604 --> 22:54.672
Well, we gotta figure something
out, 'cause I'm pregnant.

22:54.674 --> 22:55.940
What?

23:09.689 --> 23:13.090
I mean, we havin' a baby.

23:14.093 --> 23:15.960
Another one. Yeah.

23:16.829 --> 23:19.463
That means bigger place,
more room.

23:21.100 --> 23:22.633
We're a team. We'll do it.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.003
A kiss?

23:29.308 --> 23:32.209
This what I'm gonna have to deal with
in seven months? We can't reach?

23:32.211 --> 23:34.412
It's gonna be worse. Mm-hmm.

23:37.183 --> 23:38.749
I love you.

25:02.068 --> 25:03.400
What's good?

25:03.402 --> 25:05.282
'Sup, man? Chilling.

25:07.607 --> 25:09.807
Talk to me. What's up?

25:09.809 --> 25:12.543
I'm ready to make some money.
Okay.

25:13.779 --> 25:16.280
This ain't no easy game, though.
You know that, right?

25:16.282 --> 25:18.249
Yeah, I know.

25:18.251 --> 25:20.117
How much do you know?

25:22.021 --> 25:25.089
I'm not, like, an expert on
everything, but I can learn.

25:30.062 --> 25:33.697
But if someone wants to run a
kilo, how much would they make?

25:33.699 --> 25:36.267
Off a kilo alone,
running that...

25:37.737 --> 25:42.172
He'll see more than
three, five stacks.

25:42.174 --> 25:46.010
After you drop off,
package is complete...

25:47.580 --> 25:50.114
Two minutes, you make one call.

25:52.151 --> 25:53.717
"Cookies are finished."

25:54.487 --> 25:56.453
Everything is in code.

25:56.455 --> 25:59.557
You never say,
"The package is delivered."

25:59.559 --> 26:01.840
'Cause then you just
signed yourself over.

26:03.496 --> 26:06.931
And if you in this,
you in this.

26:08.100 --> 26:11.168
Ain't no room for error.
There's no room for slipup.

26:12.538 --> 26:15.205
First little small mistake...

26:16.542 --> 26:19.009
will get you a large sentence.

26:22.114 --> 26:25.049
Once that's done... You make
everything seem so freaking...

26:26.085 --> 26:28.819
Everything sounds like
a death threat, bro.

26:29.956 --> 26:32.656
Well, what path
you think we on?

26:34.260 --> 26:37.094
I'm trying to... I'm trying to
earn some extra cash, man.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.964
Bro, if you want to earn extra
cash, get a job at Mickey D's.

26:39.966 --> 26:42.366
Come on, man. You know what kind
of extra cash I'm talking about.

26:42.368 --> 26:44.568
All right. Well, this is
what I'm talking about.

26:44.570 --> 26:47.090
We talking about
the same thing.

26:47.640 --> 26:50.808
You said you want to man up. Ain't
no room for boys over here.

26:50.810 --> 26:52.676
I'm listening. All right.
So then listen.

26:52.678 --> 26:54.244
And like I said...

26:55.281 --> 26:58.949
You go for your pickup.
You got cash on you.

26:59.919 --> 27:04.655
After you grip your package,
one route.

27:04.657 --> 27:06.790
There's no stops,
there's no in-betweens.

27:06.792 --> 27:09.727
Ain't no go see your girl
or go see your mans.

27:09.729 --> 27:13.230
One route to the drop-off.

27:13.232 --> 27:14.531
A'ight.

27:14.533 --> 27:16.400
Nah. It ain't "a'ight."

27:16.402 --> 27:17.968
It's one route.

27:20.940 --> 27:22.640
I'm not saying I'm, like...

27:25.277 --> 27:26.810
Come with me.

27:29.448 --> 27:31.248
That's my son Sincere.

27:31.817 --> 27:33.684
Come. Come. Quick.

27:33.686 --> 27:36.020
Come here. Putt-Putt.
Come here.

27:36.022 --> 27:38.822
They're not...
They're not sharing.

27:38.824 --> 27:40.624
They're not sharing? Yes.

27:40.626 --> 27:42.359
Okay. What is that, a boo-boo?

27:42.361 --> 27:44.161
Let me see.

27:44.163 --> 27:47.031
Okay, listen. I
need you to do me a favor.

27:47.033 --> 27:48.732
Uh-uh. Look at me. Look at me.

27:48.734 --> 27:50.467
I need you to do me a favor.

27:50.469 --> 27:52.836
Daddy's doing business
right now.

27:52.838 --> 27:55.305
Can you stay outside for a
little bit for me, please?

27:55.307 --> 27:56.740
Yes. And I'll come get you?

27:56.742 --> 27:58.642
Yes. It's a deal?

27:58.644 --> 28:01.145
Yes. Can I have a hug?

28:01.147 --> 28:03.747
Don't gimme that cheap stuff.
Give me the real stuff.

28:03.749 --> 28:05.816
Go ahead, fat butt.

28:05.818 --> 28:08.138
And I'll be outside
in a minute, all right?

28:08.287 --> 28:10.120
Okay? Yeah.

28:14.293 --> 28:16.574
I ain't trying to be
in this forever, man.

28:18.230 --> 28:21.165
I got my family
to really provide for.

28:22.435 --> 28:24.201
They depend on me.

28:24.203 --> 28:28.405
But bottom line, everything
I do is for my family.

28:28.407 --> 28:32.776
And there are certain changes in
place right now for my family.

28:32.778 --> 28:34.658
Take it down to brown tacks,
it's like...

28:36.582 --> 28:38.415
I don't touch a package.

28:39.652 --> 28:41.251
I got kids.

28:42.154 --> 28:43.754
Four of 'em.

28:46.659 --> 28:51.528
It ain't for me,
you know? Like...

28:51.530 --> 28:54.898
Especially when I think about
Sincere, you know, like...

28:56.469 --> 29:00.170
The doctors diagnosed him
as being "autistic."

29:02.808 --> 29:04.842
I think my son is perfect.

29:06.912 --> 29:09.446
He's just different from
all other kids out there.

29:11.584 --> 29:16.386
Because he chooses not to maintain
eye contact with a stranger...

29:18.858 --> 29:20.578
My son is perfect.

29:22.628 --> 29:24.294
Come on, Zoe. Get down.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.396
Come on.

29:31.070 --> 29:35.072
So I'm gonna let you try,
but don't fuck up.

29:37.643 --> 29:39.444
Do a run and see what happens.

29:44.517 --> 29:46.150
I got this, man.

29:58.330 --> 30:01.330
Ain't no sympathy in this shit.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.538
It's real.

30:39.071 --> 30:41.271
She looks like the quiet one.

30:41.273 --> 30:43.073
Tequila maybe.

30:43.075 --> 30:44.708
Enjoy yourself, baby.

30:50.049 --> 30:52.516
Take it. Have a sample.

30:52.518 --> 30:54.718
You always got some new shit.

30:54.720 --> 30:56.253
That's called Barack Obama.

30:57.690 --> 30:59.223
And this is Michelle Obama.

31:00.226 --> 31:01.925
Together, I call it
Health Care.

31:02.962 --> 31:04.828
All right. See me
at the end of the night.

31:04.830 --> 31:06.430
Swing back.
You keep the sample.

31:06.432 --> 31:08.098
Yeah?

31:09.201 --> 31:11.301
What's up, guys? ID's?

31:17.142 --> 31:19.176
Both of you? Yeah. That's me.

31:19.178 --> 31:21.144
Lucky bitch.

31:22.615 --> 31:24.314
Thanks, man.

31:24.316 --> 31:27.050
<i>He wanted to know if you could
do security tonight at his club.</i>

31:27.052 --> 31:29.586
<i>For Tony Yayo,</i>
<i>the guy from G-Unit.</i>

31:29.588 --> 31:32.022
Bodyguard work or just...
Yeah. It's bodyguard work.

31:32.024 --> 31:33.523
It's one night.
What do you think?

31:34.894 --> 31:36.393
I'll do it. How many guys?

31:36.395 --> 31:38.228
You'd need, like,
three or four guys.

31:38.831 --> 31:40.397
I got some people.

31:52.478 --> 31:54.111
See that Henny? I need a drink.

31:54.113 --> 31:56.213
See the liquor all out?

31:56.215 --> 31:59.255
Nah, I wanna pour my own drink.

31:59.752 --> 32:01.451
It's my brother.

32:01.453 --> 32:04.333
He shoulda came too. We
played all right. Let me speak to him.

32:05.624 --> 32:07.905
Hold it up. Hold it, hold it.

32:12.031 --> 32:14.050
Wish he was
right here, right now.

32:14.076 --> 32:15.499
Say, "Man, you missed the show."

32:15.501 --> 32:17.834
Been locked up for 12 years.
Don't worry. He be good.

32:17.836 --> 32:20.396
Nah, 12 years is a long time.
But he learning, though.

32:21.573 --> 32:23.874
Oh, shit, yo.

32:23.876 --> 32:25.809
Don't smoke. Oh.

32:25.811 --> 32:27.678
Where I know you from?

32:27.680 --> 32:29.112
From the hood. What's good?

32:29.114 --> 32:30.915
Oh, shit, yo. What up?

32:31.650 --> 32:33.150

32:33.152 --> 32:34.751
What's goin' on, nigga?
How 'bout you?

32:34.753 --> 32:36.320
Everything good, man. Cool.

32:36.322 --> 32:38.422
- Take a seat. Sit down, man.
- Good show, man. Good shit.

32:38.424 --> 32:40.090
I'll sit down for a little bit.

32:40.092 --> 32:41.892
Have, you know, 50
while we working.

32:41.894 --> 32:43.593
What's up with you, man?

32:43.595 --> 32:46.063
Working, man. Trying to stay out
the hood, stay out the bullshit.

32:46.065 --> 32:47.664

32:47.666 --> 32:50.233
I got my nigga from Edgemere right here.
That's the homeys way.

32:50.235 --> 32:51.868
What's shaking, dog?
What's shaking, homey?

You know him?

32:53.906 --> 32:56.306
Big homey supreme.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.509

32:58.911 --> 33:00.944
Why wouldn't it be?

33:00.946 --> 33:02.479
I got the
homeys with me too, man.

33:02.481 --> 33:04.982
You ain't gotta tell me that.
I know how you move.

33:04.984 --> 33:06.950
What's good, though?

33:06.952 --> 33:09.186
I'm staying out of trouble.
How 'bout you?

33:09.188 --> 33:11.254
Same shit. Just doing
this legal hustle, man.

33:11.256 --> 33:13.557
Bodyguarding niggas like you.

33:13.559 --> 33:15.760
So you staying out the street?
You ain't on the streets.

33:15.761 --> 33:18.028
I've seen you throwing
it up over there, homey.

33:18.030 --> 33:20.263
I mean... That's Blood to the heart, man.
That shit don't change, but...

33:20.265 --> 33:21.898
Kids. You got kids, Primo?

33:21.900 --> 33:23.400
Yeah, plans two of two.

33:23.402 --> 33:25.102
You gotta live
for them kids, man.

33:25.104 --> 33:26.503
After a while, a nigga
get a little older.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.538
Gotta switch up
his hustle, man.

33:28.540 --> 33:31.441
Get kids, you gotta grow up.
You gotta leave certain things alone.

33:31.443 --> 33:32.943
Yeah, man. I had
to retire my ratchet.

33:32.945 --> 33:35.278
You gotta know when to switch it up.
Know what I'm saying?

33:35.280 --> 33:38.315
Like, the hood got love for
you, and I love the hood,

33:38.317 --> 33:41.084
but you gotta know
when to, you know...

33:41.086 --> 33:43.153
I'm in and out.
You know what I'm saying?

33:43.155 --> 33:45.355
I stop by, show niggas love.
Appreciate that.

33:45.357 --> 33:46.890
Try not to be caught up
in the bullshit,

33:46.892 --> 33:49.559
'cause you know niggas die over
petty shit in the streets, homey.

33:49.561 --> 33:51.194
You Blood.
You from Brooklyn, homey.

33:51.196 --> 33:52.863
I already know
what it is, nigga.

33:52.865 --> 33:54.831
Niggas ain't smiling
where you from.

33:54.833 --> 33:57.100
Niggas definitely ain't
smiling where I'm from.

33:57.102 --> 33:59.503
You can't wake up
smiling and be happy.

33:59.505 --> 34:03.807
Nah. You gotta walk around with
a certain kind of persona on.

34:03.809 --> 34:05.409
You know what I'm saying.

37:14.666 --> 37:16.766
Daddy. What's
your favorite color?

37:16.768 --> 37:18.768
Red.

37:18.770 --> 37:21.504
Your favorite color? Red?
Mm-hmm.

37:21.506 --> 37:24.174
What's your favorite color?
My favorite color's blue.

37:24.176 --> 37:26.876
Let me see you do your best fish.
What you gonna draw, E'niyah?

37:26.878 --> 37:29.212
- I like to draw a balloon.
- You want to draw me balloons, E'niyah?

37:29.214 --> 37:30.914
Yes. Draw me balloons.

37:30.916 --> 37:32.449
Like this. Yeah.

37:32.451 --> 37:36.219
A circle. Like that.

37:36.221 --> 37:38.688
Okay. Okay.

37:38.690 --> 37:40.657
What's wrong, Putt-Putt?

37:40.659 --> 37:42.292
He didn't want
to change his pants.

37:42.294 --> 37:43.827
Okay. Come here. Come here.

37:43.829 --> 37:45.562
You don't want to... Come here.
Come sit.

37:45.564 --> 37:47.330
Okay, okay, okay. Come.

37:47.332 --> 37:50.000
Can you stop?

37:51.403 --> 37:52.969
Can you stop, please?

37:55.674 --> 37:58.074
- All right. Enough.
- Write Mommy's name.

37:58.076 --> 38:01.378
- How do you spell your name?
- Sound it out.

38:01.380 --> 38:06.216
Um... Two name. Um, three.

38:06.218 --> 38:10.754
What three names? I
have to sound out three letters.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.627
Who wants breakfast? Me!

38:17.629 --> 38:18.962
Me!

38:18.964 --> 38:21.165
Jesus.

38:21.166 --> 38:23.367
You can make
your own breakfast.

38:26.338 --> 38:28.305
What do y'all want? Cereal?

38:28.307 --> 38:30.073
Yes!

38:33.779 --> 38:35.478
Let me see what this says.

38:36.748 --> 38:41.451
"Mom, you love me because
you like 'mens'?" What?

38:41.453 --> 38:45.221
What?

38:45.223 --> 38:47.123
And this one says,

38:47.125 --> 38:52.529
"Happy birthday, Dad. For
Dad, who I love. Boy."

38:52.531 --> 38:54.130
Ew! That's him.

38:54.132 --> 38:56.533
Thanks very much. She called
me a boy, right, E'niyah?

38:56.535 --> 38:59.102
Ow. Shoot.

38:59.104 --> 39:02.339
That looks like a... I did
not make nothing on this.

39:02.341 --> 39:04.708
You didn't make nothing? You just
folded up the pink paper for me?

39:04.710 --> 39:06.443
I'll go make another one.

39:06.445 --> 39:09.746
Can you try and make me
a triangle, please?

39:09.748 --> 39:11.448
I don't know how!

39:11.450 --> 39:13.650
I gotta hang all the
pictures on the wall.

39:13.652 --> 39:16.019
You gotta make me a triangle
so I can put it on the wall.

39:16.021 --> 39:20.457
I don't know how.
Go ask Mommy to help you.

39:20.459 --> 39:22.058
Or do you want me to help you?

39:22.060 --> 39:23.660
I want you to help me.

39:23.662 --> 39:27.142
So go get a crayon, and we're
gonna do it right here.

39:45.417 --> 39:47.457
That guy came knocking
on my door. He said...

39:48.320 --> 39:50.553
Hi, baby. How you doing?

39:50.555 --> 39:53.323
Look at him.

39:53.325 --> 39:55.325
Spend some time with your <i> titi.
</i> She came to see you.

39:55.327 --> 39:57.727
Hi, Titi.

39:57.729 --> 39:59.829
My God. You got
so handsome and big.

39:59.831 --> 40:01.931
Where you going? I gotta, um...

40:01.933 --> 40:04.868
You know where he's going? He's
coming with us for a <i> cafÃ© con leche.</i>

40:04.870 --> 40:07.036
We're gonna have some <i> cafÃ©.
</i> You know I hate coffee, Ma.

40:07.038 --> 40:09.572
Come on. You have to come with me.
Your aunt came to see you.

40:09.574 --> 40:11.307
Let's go and spend a
little time with her,

40:11.309 --> 40:12.876
have a <i> cafÃ© con leche con pan.</i>

40:12.878 --> 40:14.577
You look like you lost weight.
I'm, like...

40:14.579 --> 40:16.546
Now he's making Titi feel good.

40:16.548 --> 40:18.081
Your <i> titi</i> came to see you.

40:18.083 --> 40:20.383
And you don't give me
a kiss or a hug either, macho?

40:20.385 --> 40:23.520
Come on, Ma. Ant's waiting.

40:30.328 --> 40:32.128
Oh, my God. I don't know.

40:32.130 --> 40:34.431
They get big too fast.

40:34.433 --> 40:37.033
I didn't realize I was so heavy.
He told me I lost some weight.

40:39.171 --> 40:41.337
<i>Want you to make a
run, pick up a little package.</i>

40:41.339 --> 40:43.006
Holla back at me later on.
All right?

40:44.276 --> 40:46.509
Take a walk. Talk it out.

40:48.480 --> 40:50.681
We out of here.

41:50.976 --> 41:52.976
Is he bothering you?

41:52.978 --> 41:55.812
Just a bit. Just a little bit?

41:55.814 --> 42:00.717
We're drinking
our drinks right now.

42:00.719 --> 42:03.000
How do we stay in touch?

42:09.094 --> 42:10.760
Yo, what's good, man?

42:10.762 --> 42:13.563
What the fuck you doing out here?
What you doing?

42:13.565 --> 42:15.265
Nothing. Just chilling.
Enjoying the night.

42:15.267 --> 42:16.766
Who this? Who this?

42:16.768 --> 42:19.235
Hi. Jasmin.
This my girl, Jasmin.

42:19.237 --> 42:21.337
This your girl? Yeah, man.

42:21.339 --> 42:23.406
You got a good one. Come here.

42:23.408 --> 42:24.874
You all right? Yeah, I'm okay.

42:24.876 --> 42:27.176
Tell her relax.
She around family.

42:27.178 --> 42:30.179
She a little too nice for you.
Turn around for me, sweetie.

42:30.181 --> 42:33.283
Taking care of John?
Of course. All the time.

42:33.285 --> 42:34.851
Don't work him out too much.

42:34.853 --> 42:37.153
I need him to, you know, be
energized in the morning.

42:37.155 --> 42:38.588
Bye, brother. Why?

42:38.590 --> 42:40.156
Huh? Why?

42:40.992 --> 42:42.825
None of your business
right now.

42:42.827 --> 42:44.460
We'll see how long
you stick around.

42:44.462 --> 42:46.062
Come on, man.
Watch your mouth, yo.

42:46.064 --> 42:47.630
For her? Yeah, man.

42:47.632 --> 42:49.566
Fuck outta here. Go ahead.
Take her home, Johnny.

42:49.568 --> 42:51.301
You some disrespectful-ass
nigga, man.

42:51.303 --> 42:53.269
What happened? John.

42:53.271 --> 42:55.572
What, man? Don't get too
big for your britches.

42:55.574 --> 42:57.574
You're disrespectful, man.

43:00.278 --> 43:02.079
Where does
your mom think you're at?

43:02.080 --> 43:04.914
She thinks I'm here, just alone.

43:04.916 --> 43:07.817
She probably knows that
someone's over here.

43:07.819 --> 43:09.752
I don't want her to know that.

43:09.754 --> 43:12.121
She started talking to me
about condoms earlier.

43:12.123 --> 43:15.224
So what else did she say? Did
she mention anything about me?

43:15.226 --> 43:18.795
Of course. She always mentions you.

43:18.797 --> 43:21.598
What did she say? She said,
"When is the wedding day?"

43:21.600 --> 43:24.567
Oh, my God. Shut up.
You know my mom.

43:24.569 --> 43:28.037
And what did
you tell her? Did you tell her a date?

43:28.039 --> 43:31.507
Look at you. Look at
you, moving hella fast.

43:35.880 --> 43:38.200
I told her that I like you.

43:40.185 --> 43:43.426
I told her you were cute too.

44:04.209 --> 44:05.942
My phone is, like,
going crazy over here.

44:05.944 --> 44:08.378
Why don't you put it on silent?

44:08.380 --> 44:10.680
All these people... I wonder
who's texting me right now.

44:10.682 --> 44:12.248
It's not me.

44:14.753 --> 44:17.587
No, but, seriously,

44:17.589 --> 44:19.656
don't try to fight
for something so hard.

44:19.658 --> 44:22.158
You might get answers
you don't wanna know.

44:23.728 --> 44:26.529
What if I do wanna know?

44:26.531 --> 44:29.732
Sometimes things
are better left unsaid.

44:52.724 --> 44:56.659
It was like when I was, like, seven.
We were just at the park.

44:56.661 --> 45:00.229
And he would always run and I would always
chase him, but I could never catch him.

45:00.231 --> 45:02.432
He was way too fast.

45:02.434 --> 45:04.801
And he grabbed my right hand
with his right hand,

45:04.803 --> 45:07.837
and he grabbed my left hand
with his left hand.

45:07.839 --> 45:09.439
He just started running,

45:09.441 --> 45:12.241
and I had to, like, try to keep up
with him because he had my hands.

45:12.243 --> 45:13.676
And I could.

45:13.678 --> 45:17.013
For like a brief second I was
running just as fast as him.

45:17.015 --> 45:21.284
And, like, I knew I was flying.

46:22.580 --> 46:25.348
I'm up!

46:25.350 --> 46:28.518
Are you up or are you awake?

46:28.520 --> 46:30.987
I'm up, Ma. I'm up.

46:44.335 --> 46:46.002
Oh, f...

46:47.672 --> 46:51.107
You better clean this room before
you leave the house! You hear me?

46:52.177 --> 46:55.211
I got it, I got it, I got it, Ma.
I got it.

46:55.213 --> 46:57.346
I mean it.

46:57.348 --> 46:59.748
Yes.

47:15.033 --> 47:16.732
I don't wanna work
in no supermarket.

47:16.734 --> 47:18.534
<i>Nene,</i> you know, work is work.

47:18.536 --> 47:20.937
As long as it's honest
work, it's work. This...

47:20.939 --> 47:22.471
What's wrong
with the supermarket?

47:25.376 --> 47:29.245
Can you just stop by
before you go to the park?

47:29.247 --> 47:33.082
I'll stop by and see
what they're hiring for.

47:33.084 --> 47:34.650
Because Don Jose's
waiting for you.

47:34.652 --> 47:37.086
I already talked to him about it.
He's already waiting for you.

47:37.088 --> 47:40.756
Look at you. He gonna come up to me and
gonna start asking me mad questions.

47:40.758 --> 47:43.259
Well, he gonna ask you questions
to give you the job, John.

47:43.261 --> 47:44.927
I don't even wanna work there.

47:44.929 --> 47:46.629
You just walk in
and they gonna hire you?

47:46.631 --> 47:49.298
But you setting me up for interviews
you haven't even talked to me about.

47:49.300 --> 47:53.102
Cause if I talk to you
about it, you're gonna say no.

47:53.104 --> 47:55.204
I'm just looking out. You're
always doing that, Ma.

47:55.206 --> 47:58.447
I'm just looking out. I know
you always looking out for me.

48:07.585 --> 48:09.652
So, what up, yo? You Primo boy?

48:09.654 --> 48:12.154
Primo sent me. I'm not his boy, man.
My name is John.

48:12.156 --> 48:14.357
So whose boy you be? Melvin.

48:14.359 --> 48:16.692
Oh, you Melvin's boy?
Yeah, man.

48:16.694 --> 48:18.628
Your old man was good people, man.
Definitely, definitely.

48:18.630 --> 48:21.564
Well, come here, man.
Let me holla at you, man.

48:23.134 --> 48:27.303
Yo, anything you need,

48:27.305 --> 48:30.106
you come holla at me,
all right?

48:30.108 --> 48:32.909
I got you.
Melvin was good to me.

48:32.911 --> 48:35.478
You heard? All right, man.

48:35.480 --> 48:37.980
Good looks, man. I got a little
something for you though, man.

48:37.982 --> 48:40.983
Yes, sir.
You know I respect that.

48:40.985 --> 48:43.386
That's just good business.

48:43.388 --> 48:47.156
Hold up, man.
All right, let me see it.

48:47.158 --> 48:49.225
All right, I like that.
I like that.

48:49.227 --> 48:51.761
Stay where you are. Stay
where you are. My man.

48:51.763 --> 48:55.323
All right. Yes, sir. All right.

49:06.277 --> 49:09.038
That's just good business, man.
I like that. Yeah, man.

49:15.353 --> 49:18.793
All right. Three hundred
for two shifts.

49:21.626 --> 49:23.592
Thanks, bro.

49:23.594 --> 49:25.127
You should count that.

49:25.129 --> 49:28.764
I just watched you count it.
I trust you.

49:28.766 --> 49:30.800
Well, um...

49:30.802 --> 49:34.704
Kinda need some more shifts.
You got anything going?

49:34.706 --> 49:37.974
Thing is, I only need
bouncers two nights a week.

49:37.976 --> 49:39.542
Friday and Saturday.

49:42.213 --> 49:45.381
Well, I can kind of use
anything right now.

49:46.851 --> 49:48.851
I got something.

49:48.853 --> 49:50.553
My sister's ex is a nut job.

49:50.555 --> 49:53.676
Nothing serious. But he just
gets out of hand sometimes.

49:57.095 --> 49:58.661
I'll take it.

50:03.301 --> 50:07.636
Hold on. I'll call you later.
All right.

50:07.638 --> 50:09.572
What's up, Ma? Hi, baby.

50:09.574 --> 50:11.173
Eh, eh.

50:11.175 --> 50:13.576
What happened?

50:13.578 --> 50:15.411
I was outside.

50:17.315 --> 50:18.814
Come here.

50:18.816 --> 50:21.317
Come on, Ma. Come here.

50:24.389 --> 50:26.522
What's up?

50:33.097 --> 50:34.797
What's up?

50:36.034 --> 50:38.167
Stop looking at me like that, Ma.
Come on.

50:38.169 --> 50:41.003
You think I don't know, John?
Know what?

50:41.005 --> 50:44.774
Did you went to talk to Don Jose
about the job in the supermarket?

50:48.246 --> 50:51.347
Come on, Ma, don't start with this.
Please don't.

50:55.486 --> 50:57.453
What were you doing
in the park?

50:57.455 --> 50:59.522
Nothing. I was just playing
ball with Ant. Come on.

50:59.524 --> 51:03.025
That's what your father
used to say to me, John.

51:03.027 --> 51:04.527
But I didn't
pay attention to him,

51:04.529 --> 51:06.495
'cause we were little kids
and I was in love and...

51:06.497 --> 51:08.697
Come on, Ma. I'm not a baby.
But you're my kid, John.

51:08.699 --> 51:11.801
I'm not a baby, Ma. You're
not fooling anybody, John.

51:11.803 --> 51:13.469
You're not fooling me.

51:18.876 --> 51:21.110
Can you please stop asking me questions?
I'm gonna go to my room.

51:21.112 --> 51:22.745
No. Eh.

51:22.747 --> 51:25.581
Don't walk away from me
when I'm talking to you.

51:25.583 --> 51:28.423
Come on. I really don't wanna
talk right now.

51:36.894 --> 51:38.360
If you knew he was
doing all of this,

51:38.362 --> 51:40.229
why you stay with him so long?

51:40.231 --> 51:42.832
Because I loved him, John.

51:42.834 --> 51:45.234
I couldn't tell you
what he was really doing...

51:45.236 --> 51:47.670
because I was
not there with him.

51:49.107 --> 51:51.540
He protected me
from things like that.

51:54.045 --> 51:55.678
He loved you.

51:55.680 --> 51:59.148
He can't even protect me now.
How does he love me?

51:59.150 --> 52:02.151
And when I needed
something, he was there.

52:02.153 --> 52:03.752
When he would call...

52:03.754 --> 52:06.255
You don't remember because
you were so young, but he...

52:06.257 --> 52:07.858
Ma, but it's not all
about the money, Ma.

52:07.859 --> 52:10.993
It's not all about what he gives
you every first of the month.

52:10.995 --> 52:13.329
It's not anything
about that, Ma.

52:14.999 --> 52:19.502
He tried to be a father, a man
of his house, but he couldn't.

52:19.504 --> 52:22.071
All he knew was the streets, so
he went back on the streets,

52:22.073 --> 52:23.672
and I couldn't stop him.

52:24.942 --> 52:27.176
He just couldn't be here, John.

52:27.178 --> 52:28.844
He chose to be out there.

52:30.448 --> 52:32.748
You don't understand that.

52:32.750 --> 52:35.684
When people look at you,
they remember your father.

52:37.388 --> 52:41.891
And sometimes people
wanted to hurt him.

52:41.893 --> 52:45.494
And I don't want the same
thing to happen to you...

52:45.496 --> 52:48.631
just because you
remind people of him.

52:51.202 --> 52:53.202
And every day,

52:53.204 --> 52:58.340
every single time you walk out
that door and you go to that park,

52:58.342 --> 53:00.309
all I can do is worry.

53:00.311 --> 53:02.871
Me and my father are not
the same people, Mother.

53:06.117 --> 53:08.851
You're putting yourself in the same
position that your father did.

53:08.853 --> 53:10.586
No, I'm not. We're
not the same person.

53:10.588 --> 53:12.922
Hanging out with who knows...

53:14.292 --> 53:15.958
with the wrong kind of people.

53:15.960 --> 53:17.560
Ma, can I just go to my room?

53:17.562 --> 53:20.803
I really don't wanna talk
about this right now.

53:24.769 --> 53:26.702
John.

53:26.704 --> 53:28.204
What?

53:28.206 --> 53:30.606
Don't walk away from me.

53:30.608 --> 53:33.676
I'm here. I'm talking to you, but
you're not telling me anything.

53:33.678 --> 53:35.811
What is it that you
want me to tell you?

53:35.813 --> 53:39.181
I want you to tell me who my father was.
What... Who was he?

53:39.183 --> 53:43.185
I told you... Why did he leave me
when I was five years old, Ma? Why?

53:43.187 --> 53:45.020
You're too young to understand.

53:45.022 --> 53:47.323
And that's all I hear over and over
again... that I'm too young, Ma.

53:47.325 --> 53:50.893
Why does no one understand that I
don't have a father anymore, Ma?

53:50.895 --> 53:52.695
And I don't have a husband!

53:54.265 --> 53:58.067
Like I told you before, Ma, just... I
just don't understand this anymore.

53:58.069 --> 53:59.802
I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

53:59.804 --> 54:01.971
I don't know
what people want from me.

54:01.973 --> 54:05.975
Everybody talks about my father,
saying he's so... he's such a big man.

54:05.977 --> 54:08.010
Like people... people want me
to follow in his footsteps.

54:08.012 --> 54:10.112
Did I told you to follow
your father's footsteps?

54:10.114 --> 54:12.548
No, Ma, but I'm not
talking about you.

54:12.550 --> 54:15.251
Who wants you to follow
your father's footsteps?

54:15.253 --> 54:17.486
Who's putting all this shit
in your head?

54:17.488 --> 54:19.021
'Cause I know it's not me.

54:21.125 --> 54:24.560
He was in the streets and he
got shot in the head, okay?

54:24.562 --> 54:28.964
For being in the wrong place
with the wrong people.

54:28.966 --> 54:31.800
I don't want nobody
knocking on that door...

54:31.802 --> 54:34.637
telling me, "Your son
got shot in the head."

54:37.008 --> 54:39.041
How many times...

54:39.043 --> 54:42.378
in just one month you hear that
something happened to somebody...

54:42.380 --> 54:44.480
out there in that street?

54:44.482 --> 54:46.782
Somebody got shot.
Somebody got stabbed.

54:46.784 --> 54:49.545
I ain't my fa... They found
somebody dead in a building.

54:53.057 --> 54:56.325
Me and my father is
two different people, Mother.

54:56.327 --> 54:58.627
We two different people.
That's what you think.

54:59.897 --> 55:01.597
You don't know, John.

55:42.139 --> 55:43.839
Looking sharp.

56:11.969 --> 56:14.369
Think it was a setup?

56:18.342 --> 56:20.709
I don't think it was
a stray bullet.

56:24.448 --> 56:27.182
Who would wanna
kill him though?

56:27.184 --> 56:29.151
Well, people get envious.

56:30.554 --> 56:34.123
He was handsome, he was
strong and he could fight.

56:35.493 --> 56:37.813
A stray bullet to the head.

56:39.296 --> 56:41.063
I don't think so.

56:57.581 --> 57:00.621
I'm gonna jump to you, okay?
Jump.

57:01.919 --> 57:05.254
What the hell? That was like
a ballet jump right there.

57:05.256 --> 57:06.989
I wasn't prepared for that.

57:06.991 --> 57:09.425
I need to have weight
structure, weight balance.

57:09.427 --> 57:11.860
Oh, my God, whatever.

57:11.862 --> 57:13.729
Salsa is like the same thing.
Catching.

57:13.731 --> 57:15.664
Hey, hey, you gotta catch.

57:15.666 --> 57:17.766
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

57:30.448 --> 57:32.815
<i>You know Primo
runs everything, right?</i>

57:32.817 --> 57:34.817
<i>That's what people say.</i>

57:36.420 --> 57:40.222
<i>But then my pop gets capped
and it's, like, bad luck?</i>

57:40.224 --> 57:41.957
<i>What are you trying to say?</i>

57:41.959 --> 57:45.027
How does my pops die
and nobody knows anything?

57:48.399 --> 57:49.965
What do you...

58:29.907 --> 58:33.408
Okay, so this is
what he looks like.

58:33.410 --> 58:35.177
This is the man
you wanna look for.

58:35.179 --> 58:37.312
And I don't even know
if he's gonna show up.

58:37.314 --> 58:41.550
But if he does, just keep it calm.
I just don't want a scene.

58:41.552 --> 58:43.051
Just diffuse the situation.

58:45.489 --> 58:47.623
All the men. All the ladies.

58:47.625 --> 58:50.259
Grab a hand, girls.
One, two, three!

58:51.695 --> 58:54.029
Oh, you gotta shake it better than that.
Let's go.

58:54.031 --> 58:57.065
Get 'em up there!
Get 'em up there!

58:57.067 --> 58:58.834
Whoo!

58:58.836 --> 59:02.004
All the way around.
All the way around.

59:10.581 --> 59:12.581
One more time.

59:12.583 --> 59:16.151
Big pose for that camera.
Give me a pose.

59:17.221 --> 59:20.822
Looking good.
Let's go. Raise your hands!

59:22.426 --> 59:24.359
And now my man.

59:24.361 --> 59:29.197
For Rocky himself. Let's hear it for Adam.

59:30.768 --> 59:34.403
Grab a handle. Grab a handle.

59:34.405 --> 59:36.905
One, two, three!

59:36.907 --> 59:38.840
<i>It's a coming-of-age thing.</i>

59:38.842 --> 59:41.810
You know, the kid's gotta learn
a whole part of the Torah.

59:41.812 --> 59:43.645
He's gotta sing it and read it.

59:43.647 --> 59:49.518
So he recites a mantra and, you
know, memorizes it and says it out,

59:49.520 --> 59:51.153
and that makes him a man?

59:51.155 --> 59:53.889
It's kind of like a mantra. Yeah,
I never thought about it... Yeah.

59:53.891 --> 59:56.658
Yeah, I mean... And we all know
it's not really being a man.

59:56.660 --> 59:59.428
I mean, you're 13. He's got
enough problems, but...

59:59.430 --> 01:00:01.330
It's kind of similar
to what I do.

01:00:02.733 --> 01:00:05.667
I recited and remembered
an oath, a pledge.

01:00:05.669 --> 01:00:08.670
Said it out loud
to my brothers.

01:00:08.672 --> 01:00:11.273
Did my initiation, and...

01:00:11.275 --> 01:00:14.876
Now, this is for what? Initiation
for... Being Blood, you know.

01:00:14.878 --> 01:00:17.312
Oh, okay. Had to fight
seven different dudes.

01:00:17.314 --> 01:00:21.116
What do you mean, at the same time?
Yeah. Shows strength.

01:00:22.219 --> 01:00:25.354
When I changed and turned
Blood, I was 12.

01:00:25.356 --> 01:00:27.189
After that, you get an oath.

01:00:27.191 --> 01:00:29.691
You get a pledge that you have
to recite, you gotta memorize.

01:00:29.693 --> 01:00:31.193
You know, back in the days,

01:00:31.195 --> 01:00:33.562
you felt like, boom,
I just fought seven dudes.

01:00:33.564 --> 01:00:36.832
You know, I feel like I'm a man.
That's like my kid's age.

01:00:38.168 --> 01:00:39.735
I was 12. He's 13.

01:00:39.737 --> 01:00:43.057
Jesus Christ, he didn't
have to fight seven guys.

01:00:43.741 --> 01:00:45.374
A lot of people
look at me and say,

01:00:45.376 --> 01:00:47.676
"You know, Prim, at 12
years old, you're a kid."

01:00:47.678 --> 01:00:51.113
Behind that was I had nobody.

01:00:51.115 --> 01:00:53.882
And the only people that really
embraced me and showed me love...

01:00:53.884 --> 01:00:57.352
was dudes that my brother
knew, and, you know...

01:00:57.354 --> 01:00:59.721
I joined the life, you know.

01:00:59.723 --> 01:01:04.126
I made the decision that if I didn't
have the family at home that I wanted,

01:01:04.128 --> 01:01:07.562
that the family outside on the
streets, they accepted me.

01:01:07.564 --> 01:01:09.398
And...

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:16.038
I can't give it up, but I'm
ready for a big change.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.707
Like, I don't want the
same things for my kids.

01:01:18.709 --> 01:01:21.543
You know, I don't want
my son to ever feel like...

01:01:21.545 --> 01:01:24.579
the only choice he has
is the streets.

01:01:24.581 --> 01:01:26.248
You know?
That's why I take that time.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.767
I'm getting money.

01:01:45.769 --> 01:01:47.436
It'll be good tomorrow.

01:01:49.273 --> 01:01:51.873
Promised the kids
I'd take 'em to the park.

01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:55.877
Oh, so that means you have to do it.
Yeah.

01:01:55.879 --> 01:01:58.013
And they're not gonna
let you forget.

01:01:58.015 --> 01:02:01.049
No, especially Nevaeh
or Elijah.

01:02:13.530 --> 01:02:15.097
Why are you with me?

01:02:15.966 --> 01:02:17.933
Why am I with you? Mm-hmm.

01:02:17.935 --> 01:02:19.935
You make me happy.

01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:58.440
What's up, baby? What up?

01:02:58.442 --> 01:03:00.208
What's good?

01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:03.145
- Yo, you remember BB?
- Yeah.

01:03:03.147 --> 01:03:06.114
All right. You remember RayLo?
Yeah, what's up?

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:08.817
Go over to BB's, pick something
up and take it over to RayLo.

01:03:08.819 --> 01:03:10.385
I could do that, man.

01:03:26.036 --> 01:03:28.970
We need to get this shit popping.
For real.

01:03:28.972 --> 01:03:30.839
Yo, what up, yo?

01:03:31.942 --> 01:03:34.676
What's good, RayLo?
What's going on, big man?

01:03:34.678 --> 01:03:37.212
Hear you working with Primo now.
Yeah, man. What's up?

01:03:37.214 --> 01:03:39.047
- Think you big time, yo?
- Shut the fuck up, man.

01:03:39.049 --> 01:03:42.050
Yeah, you pussy. Shut the fuck up, man.
What up, man?

01:03:42.052 --> 01:03:44.152
What you mean, shut the fuck up?
You heard me.

01:03:44.154 --> 01:03:46.354
You know where you at right now?
I know exactly where I'm at.

01:03:46.356 --> 01:03:48.590
Where you at right now?
Where you at right now?

01:03:48.592 --> 01:03:50.892
You gonna do something right now?
This is Lo's block, man.

01:03:50.894 --> 01:03:53.028
You work for Primo, man.
Shut the fuck up, man.

01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:55.297
What happened, man? What up?
What you mean, what up?

01:03:55.299 --> 01:03:57.899
Yo, man. Yo, keep your bitches tamed, yo.
You know where you at, man?

01:03:57.901 --> 01:04:00.135
Keep your bitches tamed, yo.
What happened?

01:04:00.137 --> 01:04:01.870
Chill out. Chill out.

01:04:01.872 --> 01:04:04.139
You got that?
With the business, man.

01:04:06.310 --> 01:04:07.943
Hey, yo,

01:04:07.945 --> 01:04:10.312
tell your man I said
what's up, man.

01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:14.216
Be safe in these streets, man.

01:04:14.218 --> 01:04:16.351
Fuck you, man. Get
the fuck outta here.

01:04:16.353 --> 01:04:19.087
Tell your boy
to take his tampon out, yo.

01:04:19.089 --> 01:04:21.356
All right. Fuck outta here, yo.

01:04:21.358 --> 01:04:24.918
Funny man. Tank-top
ass, rookie niggas.

01:04:41.745 --> 01:04:43.211
â™ª Swag off the boat â™ª

01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:45.213
â™ª And I'm just
hopping in the moat â™ª

01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:47.949
â™ª Fuck her up
like a bad bitch â™ª

01:04:47.951 --> 01:04:51.186
â™ª No more side sit, doing the
high flip fly, flip fly â™ª

01:04:51.188 --> 01:04:52.888
â™ª Flip fly, high tip â™ª

01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:55.171
â™ª Motherfucker,
get outta here â™ª

01:04:59.529 --> 01:05:01.329
Hello?

01:05:01.331 --> 01:05:03.198
Yo, P.

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:05.267
Man, that shit ain't
touched down yet.

01:05:05.269 --> 01:05:08.236
He left a hour ago though.

01:05:08.238 --> 01:05:11.139
Well, I guess you got
a problem, homey.

01:05:11.141 --> 01:05:13.382
All right. Heard.

01:05:14.645 --> 01:05:16.244
What up?

01:05:31.962 --> 01:05:33.595
Yo, what's good?

01:05:33.597 --> 01:05:35.463
Hey.

01:05:35.465 --> 01:05:37.999
What's up? Nothing.
Just hanging out.

01:05:38.001 --> 01:05:39.701
What up, Ang? Oh, hey.

01:05:39.703 --> 01:05:42.637
What are you doing? Man, I'm about
to... I gotta go run real quick.

01:05:42.639 --> 01:05:45.373
Where are you going?

01:05:45.375 --> 01:05:48.043
Don't ask questions, babe.
Just stop asking questions.

01:05:48.979 --> 01:05:51.479
I'm good. You good?

01:05:51.481 --> 01:05:53.381
Yeah. All right.

01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:56.732
I'm gonna holla
at you, all right?

01:05:58.288 --> 01:06:00.822
Yo, Ang, I'm gonna
holla at you.

01:06:15.105 --> 01:06:18.625
What's up? We all good?
Yeah, we good.

01:06:20.444 --> 01:06:22.877
Took the long route home, huh?

01:06:22.879 --> 01:06:25.213
I ain't know you was timing me.

01:06:26.483 --> 01:06:29.244
Why you looking at me like that?
What happened?

01:06:33.023 --> 01:06:35.256
What... What happened?

01:06:36.526 --> 01:06:38.059
RayLo just called.

01:06:38.061 --> 01:06:39.894
He ain't get the package.

01:06:39.896 --> 01:06:41.596
What?

01:06:41.598 --> 01:06:43.565
Had a nice stroll, huh?

01:06:43.567 --> 01:06:47.936
Nah... Yo, Primo, man,
I gave him the package.

01:06:47.938 --> 01:06:50.305
Well, seems like we
got a problem then.

01:06:54.344 --> 01:06:58.113
Grip everybody up. I mean,
get 'em all together.

01:06:58.115 --> 01:07:01.683
And check in on RayLo and
see what's up with that.

01:07:01.685 --> 01:07:03.318
All right. Cool?

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:04.719
Yeah.

01:07:14.998 --> 01:07:16.564
Sit down, John.

01:07:26.643 --> 01:07:28.676
I gave him the package.

01:07:32.783 --> 01:07:35.483
If I find out otherwise, John,

01:07:37.354 --> 01:07:40.634
your pops is gonna roll over in
his grave right next to you.

01:07:45.662 --> 01:07:47.328
Yo, Prim, man.

01:07:48.198 --> 01:07:51.399
I gave him that...
Stop... talking.

01:07:57.374 --> 01:07:59.941
I put a lot of faith in you.

01:07:59.943 --> 01:08:02.343
You know that?

01:08:02.345 --> 01:08:04.279
You know what that means?

01:08:04.281 --> 01:08:05.847
Come on, man, I gave him that...

01:08:05.849 --> 01:08:07.449
Shut up.

01:08:14.858 --> 01:08:17.759
Look at me...

01:08:17.761 --> 01:08:19.594
and listen.

01:08:34.444 --> 01:08:36.810
Everybody is
giving you respect...

01:08:36.813 --> 01:08:38.712
because of me.

01:08:40.250 --> 01:08:42.729
Because of who your father was.

01:08:49.626 --> 01:08:51.960
This business...

01:08:51.962 --> 01:08:53.595
this out there...

01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:56.631
is based off one thing...

01:08:57.968 --> 01:08:59.600
respect.

01:09:03.707 --> 01:09:06.774
Kasey. Benz.

01:09:06.776 --> 01:09:09.644
Vito. Midnight.

01:09:11.214 --> 01:09:14.749
They all work for me
because of respect.

01:09:18.721 --> 01:09:20.354
You know why?

01:09:21.957 --> 01:09:24.492
Because they fear me.

01:09:27.898 --> 01:09:29.863
Because if one slip up,

01:09:31.768 --> 01:09:33.600
there are consequences.

01:09:40.443 --> 01:09:44.479
Even RayLo, he knows that.

01:09:44.481 --> 01:09:46.447
He wouldn't even think
of coming to me...

01:09:46.448 --> 01:09:48.082
with that bullshit lie.

01:09:48.084 --> 01:09:49.783
I gave him... Shut...

01:09:56.159 --> 01:10:00.395
We been doing business
too long, too right.

01:10:02.432 --> 01:10:06.768
But you... these motherfuckers
is watching you.

01:10:09.306 --> 01:10:11.406
Then this happens?

01:10:51.681 --> 01:10:53.715
- What's good?
- What's going on?

01:10:53.717 --> 01:10:56.751
Talk to me. So what happened?

01:10:56.753 --> 01:11:00.221
Your man ain't show up. Yo,
why you lying for, man?

01:11:00.223 --> 01:11:02.590
You already know
our history, man.

01:11:02.592 --> 01:11:05.793
Yo, fuck you, man. You
really lying right now.

01:11:06.596 --> 01:11:08.930
Yo, you better get your man.

01:11:08.932 --> 01:11:11.866
You really gonna believe him? You
really gonna believe him right now?

01:11:11.868 --> 01:11:13.801
Yo. Come on, man, this guy...

01:11:13.803 --> 01:11:16.471
Shut the fuck up.

01:11:29.052 --> 01:11:32.754
So you're saying he's lying.

01:11:34.424 --> 01:11:36.591
That he stole the package.

01:11:36.593 --> 01:11:38.793
And now he's saying he didn't.

01:11:40.030 --> 01:11:42.271
You know what that means?

01:11:46.703 --> 01:11:48.536
Speak!

01:11:48.538 --> 01:11:51.018
I know you know what that mean.

01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:56.878
RayLo is lying to me right now.

01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.513
That's what you saying.

01:12:00.183 --> 01:12:02.850
Did he take what was mine?

01:12:04.287 --> 01:12:06.821
- Yeah.
- Son of a bitch.

01:12:07.924 --> 01:12:09.557
Yo.

01:12:09.559 --> 01:12:11.392
Yo.

01:12:12.028 --> 01:12:13.561
Yo. Kasey.

01:12:13.563 --> 01:12:15.263
Fuck this nigga.

01:12:15.265 --> 01:12:17.231
You already know.

01:12:17.233 --> 01:12:18.700
Get the fuck off.

01:12:18.702 --> 01:12:20.968
Come on.
Don't worry about that.

01:12:20.970 --> 01:12:23.370
Get the fuck off. It's done.

01:12:58.675 --> 01:13:03.044
This out here...
this ain't no joke, man.

01:13:06.883 --> 01:13:10.685
A young nigga like you...
you get bodied,

01:13:10.687 --> 01:13:13.488
shit won't even make the news.

01:13:15.291 --> 01:13:17.611
You're just another number.

01:13:18.428 --> 01:13:21.062
Nobody gonna care.

01:13:21.064 --> 01:13:24.832
Nobody gonna stop. Nothing.

01:13:30.373 --> 01:13:32.640
Back there with RayLo,

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.547
I was just defending myself.

01:13:44.888 --> 01:13:48.022
And I really don't care
what you think about it.

01:13:52.595 --> 01:13:55.062
Then you're a ballsy-ass kid.

01:13:55.064 --> 01:13:58.705
'Cause for once you
standing up for yourself.

01:14:51.054 --> 01:14:54.155
You know, me and your old man used
to come out here and kick back.

01:14:55.592 --> 01:14:57.725
Always at night though.

01:14:58.995 --> 01:15:00.828
He liked this place.

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:06.133
He used to take me here
at night too.

01:15:14.377 --> 01:15:16.511
Let me ask you something.

01:15:17.881 --> 01:15:20.715
What do you know about his murder?
What happened?

01:15:23.353 --> 01:15:25.433
I know what you know.

01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:27.955
Stray bullet.

01:15:29.125 --> 01:15:31.125
Wrong time,

01:15:31.127 --> 01:15:32.793
wrong place.

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:40.067
Wrong time, wrong place.

01:15:41.638 --> 01:15:44.071
I guess that's right where
you don't wanna be, huh?

01:15:51.881 --> 01:15:54.882
You know, sometimes...

01:15:54.884 --> 01:15:57.952
I feel like I'm in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

01:15:59.355 --> 01:16:01.289
You ever feel like that?

01:16:04.427 --> 01:16:06.727
Son, that's where we were born.

01:16:09.399 --> 01:16:11.866
You think this shit is funny?

01:16:13.136 --> 01:16:15.202
Your dad would be proud.

01:16:15.838 --> 01:16:17.505
You look just like him.

01:16:17.507 --> 01:16:19.307
I don't look shit like him.

01:16:27.784 --> 01:16:31.485
Looks like little man might
be growing up now, huh?

01:16:31.487 --> 01:16:33.654
I'm not playing, Primo.

01:16:35.391 --> 01:16:37.291
I know how things work.

01:16:37.293 --> 01:16:40.895
There's no such thing as a stray
bullet when you're involved.

01:16:40.897 --> 01:16:44.532
When people got beefs,
they settle them.

01:16:44.534 --> 01:16:46.701
When my pops died,

01:16:47.737 --> 01:16:50.071
it's like no one
had to pay for it.

01:16:51.307 --> 01:16:54.175
That's not how the boss man's
supposed to live, right?

01:16:54.177 --> 01:16:55.743
That's what you taught me.

01:16:55.745 --> 01:16:57.878
Actions have consequences.

01:16:57.880 --> 01:16:59.614
Right?

01:16:59.616 --> 01:17:01.649
But you know what, John?

01:17:01.651 --> 01:17:05.086
It's not the first time I had a
gun pointed at my head, homey.

01:17:06.456 --> 01:17:08.737
I remember the first time.

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:13.227
Enough with the stories, man.

01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:16.497
Tell me what happened.

01:17:16.499 --> 01:17:19.859
You're a big boy, John.
Figure it out.

01:17:20.303 --> 01:17:22.269
He got big.

01:17:22.972 --> 01:17:25.006
Too big.

01:17:25.008 --> 01:17:28.943
He didn't wanna do
business... the right way.

01:17:30.213 --> 01:17:33.080
Everybody has bosses.

01:17:33.082 --> 01:17:35.449
Your pops act like
he ain't have any.

01:17:35.451 --> 01:17:37.652
So it was his time.

01:17:37.654 --> 01:17:41.055
Sad to say, it's just business.

01:17:43.526 --> 01:17:45.767
So what you gonna do now?

01:17:45.995 --> 01:17:48.395
What your pops would've done?

01:17:49.399 --> 01:17:51.132
I ain't even know my pops.

01:17:53.269 --> 01:17:55.870
Maybe a basketball game.

01:17:55.872 --> 01:17:58.272
Maybe a trip to the beach
every two years.

01:18:02.078 --> 01:18:04.345
But I thank you
for teaching me.

01:18:05.314 --> 01:18:06.781
Now I know him.

01:18:06.783 --> 01:18:08.749
I understand him.

01:18:14.657 --> 01:18:17.858
I know exactly
what he would do right now...

01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:20.027
or what you would do.

01:18:23.933 --> 01:18:26.100
But I'm not gonna even do that.

01:19:11.447 --> 01:19:13.080
Wah!

01:19:13.983 --> 01:19:15.382
Wah!

01:19:16.719 --> 01:19:18.419
Wah!

01:19:18.421 --> 01:19:20.461
Hah!

01:19:23.626 --> 01:19:26.260
Ahh!

01:19:32.034 --> 01:19:34.101
Ah!

01:19:43.646 --> 01:19:45.179
I want ice cream!

01:19:45.181 --> 01:19:47.581
You want ice cream? Yeah.

01:19:47.583 --> 01:19:50.117
Ain't you just eat?

01:21:02.024 --> 01:21:05.526
<i>Okay. Let's do it.</i>

01:21:28.251 --> 01:21:30.718
<i>â™ª Yeah, I had it all</i>

<i>â™ª From my block to block</i>

â™ª Really got me five â™ª

01:21:49.171 --> 01:21:51.605
â™ª Five years in the pen <i>
</i> I couldn't do that â™ª

01:21:51.607 --> 01:21:53.974
<i>â™ª Ballplayer dreams</i>
<i>Man, I couldn't do that â™ª</i>

01:21:53.976 --> 01:21:56.710
â™ª I'm missing my team <i>
</i> living our dreams â™ª

01:21:56.712 --> 01:21:59.213
â™ª Bars after bars <i>
</i> Getting nasty on the scene â™ª

01:21:59.215 --> 01:22:02.016
â™ª Dolla after dolla <i>
</i> It all seems fake â™ª

01:22:02.018 --> 01:22:04.318
â™ª Broken-up lines <i>
</i> on this broken suitcase â™ª

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:07.254
â™ª I said misunderstood <i>
</i> Riding for the hood â™ª

01:22:07.256 --> 01:22:09.723
â™ª Five star, I said give <i>
</i> your boy different bush â™ª

01:22:09.725 --> 01:22:12.393
â™ª Went to Fort Greene <i>
</i> Macking with the team â™ª

01:22:12.395 --> 01:22:14.728
â™ª White so clean <i>
</i> so I sell it to a fiend â™ª

01:22:14.730 --> 01:22:17.531
â™ª Then we flip it to a dream <i>
</i> You can call it an assist â™ª

01:22:17.533 --> 01:22:20.067
â™ª Pass it to the right <i>
</i> That's my main man Rich â™ª
