00:17.896 --> 00:21.551
[whirring electronic tones]

00:21.551 --> 00:24.137
- I woke up to her
talking to my boyfriend

00:24.137 --> 00:27.275
at, like, three in
the morning, um,

00:27.275 --> 00:30.793
and it was, because
I had called him,

00:30.793 --> 00:33.931
and I, I just, I don't even know

00:33.931 --> 00:36.034
how I dialed his phone
number 'cause I was asleep,

00:36.034 --> 00:38.000
or I was in this state.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.586
And I, he, he doesn't
know what I said to him.

00:42.586 --> 00:45.724
I just started talking
in, in tongues,

00:45.724 --> 00:49.862
and, uh, after I woke up, I
didn't realize what I had done.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.206
[skittering and jangling
electronic effects]

00:55.206 --> 00:57.206
- [Woman On Recording] Why
do you wanna hurt me so much?

00:57.206 --> 00:58.137
Are you sick?

00:59.241 --> 01:01.413
You, you're really strange.

01:01.413 --> 01:05.000
[whirring electronic effects
over ominous ambient music]

01:05.000 --> 01:07.241
I was like, it's like this
is some kind of addiction

01:07.241 --> 01:10.000
that I've gotta break
away from and, uh,

01:10.000 --> 01:12.551
he encouraged it and he
shoulda just left me alone

01:12.551 --> 01:14.758
'cause I don't really
think he cares about me.

01:14.758 --> 01:18.862
[crackling electronic effects
over unsettling ambient music]

01:18.862 --> 01:20.344
And I don't think
he'll ever understand

01:20.344 --> 01:22.137
why I'm the way I, I am,

01:23.517 --> 01:25.896
'cause sometimes I don't
understand it myself.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.896
[muffled sigh]

01:29.896 --> 01:33.448
[eerie and unsettling
ambient electronic music]

01:33.448 --> 01:36.241
I don't even know, I, I
don't think he ever loved me.

01:36.241 --> 01:38.448
I don't think he
meant it at all.

01:38.448 --> 01:39.275
I wish he did.

01:40.793 --> 01:44.241
[beeping electronic tones
over shuddering ambient music]

01:44.241 --> 01:46.137
I just wanna know.

[eerie and unsettling ambient

01:54.827 --> 01:58.965
[unsettling melodic tones

02:05.827 --> 02:08.550
- [Reporter] US military has
issued four million dollars

02:08.550 --> 02:10.723
in grants to
university researchers

02:10.723 --> 02:13.724
to study ways to read
people's thoughts,

02:13.724 --> 02:16.413
but critics say such
mind reading technology

02:16.413 --> 02:18.689
could be used during
interrogations.

02:18.689 --> 02:20.482
The project's a corroboration
among researchers

02:20.482 --> 02:22.310
at the University of California.

02:22.310 --> 02:23.827
[jangling bell tones]

02:23.827 --> 02:27.103

Vermont/Santa Monica Station.

Angeles City College.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.137
[eerie ambient music with
unsettling electronic tones]

02:53.000 --> 02:55.655
- [Woman] You haven't
boarded already?

02:55.655 --> 02:59.793
[eerie ambient music
with shuddering rhythm]

03:05.000 --> 03:07.137
Why don't you stick, we
stick with Purple Line?

03:07.137 --> 03:08.000
- Right, yeah.

03:10.275 --> 03:12.551
You're not makin' it easy.

03:12.551 --> 03:15.620
- [sighs] Do you know where
this is that we're at [grunts],

03:15.620 --> 03:16.827
where the station is?

03:18.482 --> 03:19.724
- [Onlooker] Uh--

03:19.724 --> 03:20.965
- [Tristan] I need
to get to Palmdale.

03:20.965 --> 03:22.965
- No, uh, you're far
from that, buddy.

03:24.689 --> 03:27.000
[Tristan screeching
nonsensically]

03:27.000 --> 03:28.448
Are you OK?

03:28.448 --> 03:29.551
- [Woman On Recording]
You're sadistic and sick,

03:29.551 --> 03:31.000
and I hate your guts.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.172
[Tristan groans over
phone cracking to ground]

03:32.172 --> 03:33.034
- Buddy, what's your
fucking problem?

03:33.034 --> 03:33.896
- It burns!

03:35.206 --> 03:36.413
- Fucking asshole!

03:37.793 --> 03:39.206
- It's not me.

03:39.206 --> 03:40.275
- [Woman On Recording]
You've got some kind of need

03:40.275 --> 03:42.000
to play weird games,

03:42.000 --> 03:44.068
and his games are
gettin' really dangerous.

03:44.068 --> 03:45.827
[woman shrieks]

03:45.827 --> 03:47.758
- Will someone help me?

03:47.758 --> 03:50.793
Hey, buddy, give
that back to me!

03:50.793 --> 03:51.758
Shit!

03:51.758 --> 03:53.275
[Tristan groaning]

03:53.275 --> 03:54.793
- [Woman On Recording] I just
think I should pull myself,

03:54.793 --> 03:57.379
I'm wasted like hell, you're
makin' me fuckin' sick!

03:57.379 --> 03:59.931
- Hey, hey what's your problem?

04:01.310 --> 04:03.241
- [Woman On Recording] I
wanna punch your balls off!

04:03.241 --> 04:06.689
[eerie ambient music
with shuddering rhythm]

04:06.689 --> 04:08.275
- [Onlooker] Call the police.

04:08.275 --> 04:09.482
Hey, he's--

04:09.482 --> 04:11.931
[eerie ambient music
with shuddering rhythm]

04:11.931 --> 04:14.344
[Tristan shouts desperately]

04:14.344 --> 04:17.137
- [Man] The first
law of thermodynamics

04:17.137 --> 04:18.964
[shuddering percussion]

04:18.964 --> 04:22.758
energy cannot be
created or destroyed,

04:22.758 --> 04:25.034
only changed into other forms.

04:25.965 --> 04:26.931
It's one of the first things

04:26.931 --> 04:28.724
they teach you in science class,

04:30.206 --> 04:34.034
but sometimes, we have to
learn things the hard way.

04:34.034 --> 04:38.206
[eerie and pulsing

04:42.724 --> 04:44.172

04:44.172 --> 04:48.137
[static crackling over
beeping electronic tones]

04:48.137 --> 04:49.068
- [Woman On recording]
Yeah, I know

04:49.068 --> 04:50.551
you've got enough evidence,

04:50.551 --> 04:52.310
and it doesn't matter
about these calls anymore

04:52.310 --> 04:55.551
because I'm already in
way over my head anyway,

04:55.551 --> 04:58.413
so I can just tell
you what I think.

04:58.413 --> 05:00.413
If you're trying to
set me up to hurt me,

05:00.413 --> 05:02.689
you can do it, so go ahead
and do it, get it over with.

05:02.689 --> 05:04.517
I don't care anymore, you know,

05:04.517 --> 05:06.206
'cause then I'll know for sure

05:06.206 --> 05:07.931
that I could never
trust you anyway.

05:07.931 --> 05:09.448

05:14.793 --> 05:15.724
[radio beeps]

05:15.724 --> 05:16.724

05:16.724 --> 05:17.758
I need a medical crew and guide.

05:17.758 --> 05:20.000
I've got one victim of interest.

05:20.000 --> 05:20.896
- [Dispatch] Copy.

05:22.448 --> 05:23.965
Units responding
to the shooting,

05:23.965 --> 05:26.689
be sure to remain on channel
two, channel function normal.

06:18.034 --> 06:22.000
[hard drive clacking

06:22.000 --> 06:24.413
- I don't know how much
longer I have, man.

06:24.413 --> 06:25.827
[sighs] A lot of the time,

06:25.827 --> 06:27.827
I just sound like
I'm fucking crazy.

06:27.827 --> 06:31.000
They make you sound like
you're fucking crazy, arright?

06:31.000 --> 06:33.310
You know what I'm
fucking talking about!

06:33.310 --> 06:35.379
This is a warning, man,
you need to save it,

06:35.379 --> 06:37.724
and you need to put
it somewhere safe, OK?

06:37.724 --> 06:40.758
Look, my time has
come, your time is now,

06:40.758 --> 06:42.655
because then your
time will come,

06:42.655 --> 06:44.517
and it's time for
you to stand up,

06:44.517 --> 06:47.034
and it's time for you to
make precautions, all right?

06:47.034 --> 06:49.517
This isn't a fuckin'
diatribe, it's a eulogy,

06:49.517 --> 06:51.793
and understand this is the
last image you're gonna see

06:51.793 --> 06:53.310
and understand what
you need to do.

06:53.310 --> 06:56.206
Upload everything you
have and preserve it, man.

06:56.206 --> 06:59.689
Upload and run, upload
and run, run, run!

06:59.689 --> 07:01.379
Upload and run!

07:01.379 --> 07:02.689
[keyboard clacking]

07:02.689 --> 07:04.275
- This is the part we
need to to back up.

07:04.275 --> 07:05.758
I'm uploading offsite.

07:05.758 --> 07:06.931
It, it's not safe here anymore!

07:06.931 --> 07:08.241
[electronic buzzing]

07:08.241 --> 07:10.586
[eerie ambient music]

07:10.586 --> 07:12.310
- Hello, I am here to guide you

07:12.310 --> 07:15.172
through the specialized
study program.

07:15.172 --> 07:17.517
You will be developing
new technologies

07:17.517 --> 07:19.000
for the study of the mind.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.965
I hope you do well in
all your assignments.

07:21.965 --> 07:23.551
- Yeah, it's, uh,
actually pretty cool.

07:23.551 --> 07:25.551
You get to participate
in an independent study

07:25.551 --> 07:27.103
and still, at the end of it all,

07:27.103 --> 07:29.793
you get a masters degree
in psychopathology.

07:29.793 --> 07:31.275
- [Miles] I've just
always wanted to be part

07:31.275 --> 07:33.586
of something groundbreaking,
and I think this could be it.

07:33.586 --> 07:34.413
- Miles?

07:34.413 --> 07:35.241
- Yes?

07:35.241 --> 07:36.068
- Follow me, please.

07:37.827 --> 07:41.551
- Thanks, man, see ya.

07:46.862 --> 07:49.310
[door creaking]

07:49.310 --> 07:52.862
[footsteps clacking]

07:52.862 --> 07:54.862
What's with all the
heavy screening?

07:54.862 --> 07:56.379
- It's nothing to
stress out about.

07:56.379 --> 07:58.034
Everyone has to go through
the same screening process

07:58.034 --> 08:00.000
in order to be accepted
into the program.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.793
It's a small, exclusive class.

08:01.793 --> 08:06.000
[whirring and buzzing
electronic effects]

08:06.000 --> 08:09.448
OK, let me just get the system
dialed in to your reactions.

08:09.448 --> 08:12.758
[whirring electronic effects
over ominous ambient music]

08:12.758 --> 08:15.827
Currently in LA, there
are approximately 800

08:15.827 --> 08:18.827
open murder cases
of young girls.

08:18.827 --> 08:19.758
- God!

08:19.758 --> 08:21.379
- Many of them were abused.

08:21.379 --> 08:24.103
Our work here is to
prevent psychopathologies

08:24.103 --> 08:27.896
that lead to suffering and
often to violent death.

08:27.896 --> 08:29.931
Sometimes, we lose
people from the program

08:29.931 --> 08:32.551
because it's just too
much for them to handle.

08:33.931 --> 08:36.000
Are you prepared to become
involved in difficult situations

08:36.000 --> 08:38.793
which could test
you emotionally?

08:38.793 --> 08:40.551
- I'm on my way to becoming
a doctor, obviously.

08:40.551 --> 08:43.275
Emotionally detach
myself from patients.

08:43.275 --> 08:45.172
- I hope to be
able to help people

08:45.172 --> 08:49.103
with mental handicaps
that have been cast aside.

08:49.103 --> 08:50.758
- There's nothing more
in the world I wanna do

08:50.758 --> 08:53.172
than dedicate my
life to this program.

08:53.172 --> 08:54.896
- Anything I can do to help.

08:54.896 --> 08:56.344
- Whatever you ask
me, I'll do it.

08:56.344 --> 08:57.724
This is all I want.

08:58.896 --> 09:02.068
- OK, Room 107
tomorrow at one p.m.

09:02.068 --> 09:04.965
You'll be meeting with
our head of admissions.

09:04.965 --> 09:05.793
- OK.

09:07.379 --> 09:11.551
[computer buzzing over
eerie ambient music]

09:16.517 --> 09:18.000
[whirring electronic tones]

09:18.000 --> 09:20.241
- [Man In Mask] I'm a
conscious dreamer myself.

09:20.241 --> 09:22.068
I can set myself
and go somewhere,

09:22.068 --> 09:25.000
and when I go there,
then I see everything.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.758
I can fly around, I can
see papers on desks.

09:29.758 --> 09:32.620
In top security places, they
put everything on tape now

09:33.758 --> 09:35.068
'cause you can't
really go get a tape

09:35.068 --> 09:37.103
and put in on a
machine and play it,

09:37.103 --> 09:39.172
but you can look at a
desk with papers on it

09:39.172 --> 09:40.310
and read those papers.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.827
- I mean, these people
are a fucking cult!

09:45.827 --> 09:47.482
I mean, do you understand
that they're using you?

09:47.482 --> 09:50.068
I mean, everything
has gone haywire!

09:50.068 --> 09:51.586
Tell me you understand that.

09:51.586 --> 09:55.068
They took me in and made me
feel like I was somebody.

09:56.448 --> 09:59.379
They understood me,
treated me like a family.

09:59.379 --> 10:00.965
My mother died when I was five,

10:00.965 --> 10:04.068
and my father doesn't
even know that I existed.

10:04.068 --> 10:06.172
You're a bastard, an orphan.

10:06.172 --> 10:08.172
Hey, save it for brunch!

10:08.172 --> 10:09.827
Family week, that
guys an asshole!

10:09.827 --> 10:12.000
He doesn't give
a fuck about you!

10:12.000 --> 10:13.448
He used you, man!

10:13.448 --> 10:15.000
Are you gonna let me talk?

10:15.000 --> 10:16.517
He used you, don't
you understand that?

10:16.517 --> 10:17.724
What I'm tryin' to say is--
[lighter snapping]

10:17.724 --> 10:20.275
What can I do to
make you understand?

10:20.275 --> 10:22.172
What can you do to understand

10:22.172 --> 10:24.931
that you grabbed onto
this fucking cult?

10:24.931 --> 10:26.103
I'm--

10:26.103 --> 10:27.758
I'm so drained right
now, I can barely move.

10:29.965 --> 10:30.896
- [Mysterious Woman]
Depending on how well

10:30.896 --> 10:32.206
they take on that frequency,

10:32.206 --> 10:34.206
that person may
direct that frequency,

10:34.206 --> 10:35.758
and they could
start hallucinating,

10:35.758 --> 10:37.551
it could start, um,
changing their, their,

10:37.551 --> 10:40.068
their waveforms, they could
start fighting with themselves.

10:40.068 --> 10:42.241
Then they'd have a
split personality,

10:42.241 --> 10:44.206
then that just goes into a
whole nother snowball effect

10:44.206 --> 10:47.000
of insanity to themselves, and
then they're uncontrollable.

10:59.793 --> 11:02.379
[door rattling]

11:05.551 --> 11:07.000
- Miles, right?

11:07.000 --> 11:07.931
- [Miles] Yes.

11:07.931 --> 11:08.862
- Thank you so much for coming.

11:08.862 --> 11:09.965
- [Miles] Thanks for seeing me.

11:09.965 --> 11:11.275
- No problem, find the place OK?

11:11.275 --> 11:12.448
- [Miles] Yeah, yeah.

11:12.448 --> 11:13.241
- Well, you weren't
waitin' long?

11:13.241 --> 11:14.034
- [Miles] No, no.

11:15.103 --> 11:16.344
- Good, good, good, good.

11:18.241 --> 11:19.482
Before we get started,

11:19.482 --> 11:21.551
there's something
you've gotta understand.

11:21.551 --> 11:24.000
If you become part
of this program,

11:24.000 --> 11:26.724
you cannot talk about
this with anybody, Miles.

11:26.724 --> 11:27.724
- I understand.

11:27.724 --> 11:29.862
- They'll just get confused.

11:29.862 --> 11:31.310
You just can't talk about it,

11:32.517 --> 11:36.241
so I've got your word
as a fellow scientist?

11:36.241 --> 11:37.206
- You have my word.

11:38.517 --> 11:42.827
- Good, so, I ask
this to everybody.

11:42.827 --> 11:45.275
Why, why are you interested
in psychopathology?

11:46.793 --> 11:48.068
- Growing up, I was exposed

11:48.068 --> 11:50.000
to a lot of violence
at a very young age.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.034
I was, uh, raised in a home.

11:52.931 --> 11:53.896
- Orphanage?

11:53.896 --> 11:55.172
- [Miles] Yeah.

11:55.172 --> 11:57.172
- I lost my parents
when I was young.

11:57.172 --> 11:58.482
- Growing up, I
wanted to be a part

11:58.482 --> 11:59.931
of something that
made a difference,

11:59.931 --> 12:03.310
and I think the research you're
doing here is incredible.

12:03.310 --> 12:05.275
- There's nothing usual
about this program.

12:05.275 --> 12:07.758
There's nothing like it on
this campus or anyplace else.

12:07.758 --> 12:10.724
Everybody works at their
own pace, independently,

12:10.724 --> 12:13.896
and Miles, I don't
see an end to this.

12:13.896 --> 12:15.793
[eerie, buzzing ambient music]

12:15.793 --> 12:16.965

[eerie, buzzing ambient music]

12:19.206 --> 12:22.896
The only limit to this
program is one's imagination.

12:24.379 --> 12:25.206
You know?

12:28.172 --> 12:30.103
I can count on you,
there's a lot of people

12:30.103 --> 12:33.793
who aren't gonna
understand what we do here,

12:35.103 --> 12:38.931
out of ignorance, fear, but--
[eerie ambient music]

12:42.482 --> 12:45.275
- I wanna be a part
of it, I wanna help.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.068
- You've got an old soul.

12:51.034 --> 12:52.689
See it in your eyes.

[ominous and eerie

12:54.137 --> 12:55.689
I can't remember the
last time I said this,

12:55.689 --> 12:59.068
but I got a good
feeling about you,

13:01.068 --> 13:04.827
I really do.
[ominous ambient music]

13:06.000 --> 13:08.620
I want you to take
this home, OK?

13:08.620 --> 13:09.827
Look at it, your
first assignment.

13:09.827 --> 13:12.620
[ominous and eerie

13:12.620 --> 13:14.655

- Hello, I am Adam Whitney,
the director of this program.

14:01.827 --> 14:03.793
Dale, you'll be
working to different

14:03.793 --> 14:05.344
miniature camera technologies

14:05.344 --> 14:09.344
to use for the study of
human behavior patterns.

14:09.344 --> 14:12.517
Miles, you will be
creating sensors

14:12.517 --> 14:15.827
to measure fluctuations in
the body's energy field.

14:16.724 --> 14:19.241
Tristan, I want you to study

14:20.586 --> 14:24.310
the relation between
bioplasma and the human DNA.

14:25.862 --> 14:29.620
Noah, I want you to study
these images carefully

14:29.620 --> 14:31.689
so that you will
remember the information

14:31.689 --> 14:32.758
whenever I test you.

I suppose you think

15:05.862 --> 15:07.344
just 'cause I have an
illness, a mental illness,

15:07.344 --> 15:09.931
that you can treat me like
I'm some kind of guinea pig.

15:09.931 --> 15:11.379
I am a human being,
and you don't have

15:11.379 --> 15:13.000
any right to treat me this way.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.517
I don't know who you people are

15:14.517 --> 15:17.034
or what you're doing this
for, I don't really care.

15:17.034 --> 15:19.689
I never met such sick
human beings in my life.

15:19.689 --> 15:22.103
You know what, your whole

All information

15:31.379 --> 15:33.103
is on different
levels of energy.

15:33.103 --> 15:35.034
There's already a
frequency up here

15:35.034 --> 15:37.724
and it's coming off of
every television set,

15:37.724 --> 15:40.586
computer system, telephone.

15:40.586 --> 15:41.931
They're just
constantly coming out,

15:41.931 --> 15:43.689
you can't get away from it.

15:43.689 --> 15:46.172
They could just stimulate
your thoughts and feelings.

15:46.172 --> 15:49.000
Make you love,
depressed, fear, hate,

15:49.000 --> 15:50.862
move any part of your body.

15:50.862 --> 15:52.586
They could have you
jump off an airplane.

15:52.586 --> 15:54.206
They could have you
crash the airplane.

15:54.206 --> 15:56.068
You may be struggling
with it the whole time,

15:56.068 --> 15:59.000
but you would inevitably,
would have to surrender to it.

have any acetaminophen, do you?

16:09.896 --> 16:11.103
- [Miles] No, not on me.

16:12.517 --> 16:16.482
- So, uh, what-what, what do
you think of these assignments?

16:16.482 --> 16:18.620
- I think they're pretty
amazing, actually,

16:18.620 --> 16:20.034
but we're not
supposed to be talking

16:20.034 --> 16:22.206
about our specific assignments.

16:22.206 --> 16:24.000
It's an independent
study, remember?

16:25.103 --> 16:28.000
- I'm having a
difficult time, uh,

16:28.000 --> 16:31.206
digesting these case studies.
[eerie electronic music]

16:31.206 --> 16:33.482
They're kind of fucked
up to be honest with you.

16:33.482 --> 16:35.862
- Come on, these
people need our help.

16:35.862 --> 16:37.310
Just give yourself a
little bit of time, Noah,

16:37.310 --> 16:39.000
you're just letting
it get to you.

16:42.068 --> 16:44.206
Hey, do you know a
guy named Dale Wilton?

16:44.206 --> 16:45.793
Wasn't he a friend of
yours from high school?

16:45.793 --> 16:47.620
So I heard he enrolled
in the program, too.

16:49.034 --> 16:52.000
- Unless he got in, I saw him
at the, uh, reunion, fucker!

16:53.206 --> 16:55.034
Last got in touch with
each other years back.

16:55.034 --> 16:56.379
We had this horrible fight.

16:56.379 --> 16:57.379
- [Miles] Ah, bury the hatchet.

16:57.379 --> 16:59.000
- Yeah, a friend is a friend.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.586
It was a sick game, it
kept getting sicker.

17:29.793 --> 17:32.344
We were like fresh

was addicted to immortality.

17:45.758 --> 17:47.137
- Come on, drink up,
man, you all right?

17:47.137 --> 17:48.689
- Yeah.

17:48.689 --> 17:50.172
I'm OK.

17:50.172 --> 17:52.241
- Forget about the program,
it's the end of the week.

17:52.241 --> 17:53.172
Time to get out.

17:53.172 --> 17:54.689
- All right, I'm good, I'm just,

17:54.689 --> 17:56.241
you know, a little
tired, that's all.

17:56.241 --> 17:58.034
- Yeah, you look tired [scoffs].

standing upright,

bullshit, here, cheers.

18:02.103 --> 18:03.551
[glasses clink]

real strong, uh, whiskey?

18:05.172 --> 18:07.413
- Yeah, my favorite one, too.

18:07.413 --> 18:12.000
[eerie and tense

18:12.000 --> 18:15.724

awkward situation in a second.

18:15.724 --> 18:17.275
But thank you, wow!

18:18.586 --> 18:19.827
- [Miles] No, wait, here
he comes, here he comes.

18:19.827 --> 18:22.034
- Really?
[tense, eerie ambient music]

18:22.034 --> 18:23.310
This is way too
fucking confusing--

18:23.310 --> 18:26.620
- Miles, Noah, hey.

18:26.620 --> 18:28.275
- What's goin' on?

18:28.275 --> 18:29.448
- I just wanted to
know if you fuckers

18:29.448 --> 18:32.275
have put the past behind us.

18:32.275 --> 18:34.689
- Well, why would
I hold resentment?

18:34.689 --> 18:36.551
That's been such
a long time ago.

18:36.551 --> 18:37.758
- You know that
bullshit that went down,

18:37.758 --> 18:39.931
it's, like, I apologize,
and I'm sorry.

18:41.068 --> 18:42.448
- Saw you and Bernice Hall.

18:42.448 --> 18:44.275
Figured you'd become
a psych student.

18:45.758 --> 18:48.758
- It's, uh, it's the only
thing that's inspired me.

18:48.758 --> 18:51.724
- Obviously something, right?

18:51.724 --> 18:53.068

[tense electronic music]

you guys a couple of drinks.

19:12.413 --> 19:13.413
- Your friend, Dale.

Two black devils.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.896
- [Miles] I am not
fuckin' drinkin' this.

19:19.827 --> 19:21.448

19:22.931 --> 19:24.379
Fuck that guy.

writin' a letter here,

19:42.103 --> 19:44.241
and I'm gonna get this off
my chest once and for all.

19:45.103 --> 19:46.172
The letter is to the dean,

19:46.172 --> 19:48.689
and I'm really sorry [sighs],

19:48.689 --> 19:52.000
but you ruined my
life, you know that?

19:53.413 --> 19:56.103
I had a nervous breakdown, you
ruined my fuckin' life, man,

19:56.103 --> 19:59.172
and you did it on purpose,
and, uh, you enjoyed it.

20:00.586 --> 20:02.241
And you deserve for
me to turn you in,

20:02.241 --> 20:03.965
I should've turned you
in a long time ago,

20:03.965 --> 20:05.241
'cause what you did
to me was wrong.

20:05.241 --> 20:07.241
You were sexually
harassing me, I'm sorry,

20:07.241 --> 20:08.862
that's exactly what it was.

20:08.862 --> 20:10.241
Regardless of whether
I went with it

20:10.241 --> 20:11.724
or how I felt about you.

20:11.724 --> 20:14.689
That's exactly what is was, OK,
but don't rub my nose in it,

because I covered up for
you, you fuckin' prick.

- [Woman On Phone] Yeah, I think
the whole thing was a setup

20:43.862 --> 20:46.896
'cause he's got some kind
of need to play weird games,

20:46.896 --> 20:48.862
and his games would get
really dangerous, you know?

20:48.862 --> 20:50.137
He'd better watch out.

I don't need this shit,
I need a normal person.

21:09.517 --> 21:11.000
they're doin' studies
for the government.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Th-that's the, the reason
they're getting the funding

21:13.000 --> 21:14.655
for all of this.

21:14.655 --> 21:16.931
They wanna have weapons
that are undetectable

21:18.103 --> 21:19.689
unless you know what
you're looking for.

21:19.689 --> 21:22.413
Unless you know how to
interlace the waveforms,

21:22.413 --> 21:24.448
break down the
synapses of the brain.

21:25.862 --> 21:28.241
They know they can't kill
me because if they do,

21:29.379 --> 21:30.793
I've clouded that
information somewhere

21:30.793 --> 21:32.000
and someone will find it,

21:33.413 --> 21:35.931
and unless they can get me
to tell them where that's at,

21:35.931 --> 21:37.793
they may actually come out here.

- Oh, Noah, come on in,

22:00.517 --> 22:01.448
Adam Whitney.

22:01.448 --> 22:03.689
- Very nice to finally meet you.

22:03.689 --> 22:04.689
- Sit down, please.

22:06.068 --> 22:09.172
Sit down, you ought
to get off your feet.

22:09.172 --> 22:10.103
- Well, thank you.

22:10.103 --> 22:12.482
- How's your work, going along?

22:12.482 --> 22:14.137
- Going well, I guess.

22:14.137 --> 22:17.000
- I have a lot of
confidence in you, Noah.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.379
Over the years, I have developed

22:19.379 --> 22:22.000
a certain sensitivity
in reading people.

22:24.413 --> 22:27.241
I know you will do well here.

22:27.241 --> 22:29.620
Genesis 9:17,

22:31.068 --> 22:34.931
God said to Noah, "This is
the token of the covenant

22:37.172 --> 22:39.862
"which I have
established between me

22:41.034 --> 22:43.724
"and all the flesh
upon this earth."

22:44.931 --> 22:47.413
I know you will do
well here, Noah.

22:49.241 --> 22:50.862
- Thanks.

22:50.862 --> 22:52.068
- Very good.

23:10.965 --> 23:11.758

you people are,

23:11.758 --> 23:13.034
and I don't really care.

23:13.034 --> 23:15.551
I've never met such sick
human beings in my life.

23:41.310 --> 23:42.793
- [Man With Mask]
Right, so I was at USC,

23:42.793 --> 23:45.206
and I was, I was a psych major.

23:45.206 --> 23:48.586
I had a little job measuring
lie detector results.

23:48.586 --> 23:51.068
My teacher had there in
the psych department,

23:51.068 --> 23:53.482
he got me quote
"employed" out there,

23:53.482 --> 23:55.379
actually, I was just,
like, the guinea pig

23:55.379 --> 23:57.827
for early mind
control experiments,

23:57.827 --> 24:00.068
but the government
were to cover that up

24:00.068 --> 24:03.068
so the ones that were
whistleblowing, like myself,

24:03.068 --> 24:05.586
we were under threat because
we were telling the truth

24:05.586 --> 24:08.000
and exposing these
people, but, uh,

24:08.000 --> 24:09.724
these people didn't
like to be exposed,

24:09.724 --> 24:11.965
so we got threatened
as a result.

24:22.620 --> 24:24.034
- Pleasure, sir.

24:24.034 --> 24:25.275
- My pleasure, too.

24:25.275 --> 24:27.000
- [Miles] I'm a big
fan of your work.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.137
- Huh, thank you.

24:28.137 --> 24:30.172
This is a small
follow-through meeting

24:30.172 --> 24:32.034
to find out how you are doing.

24:32.034 --> 24:33.241
Is everything all right?

24:33.241 --> 24:35.206
- Absolutely, I feel
like I'm finally

24:35.206 --> 24:36.724
beginning to understand

24:36.724 --> 24:38.551
how the neurotransmitters
of the brain actually work.

24:38.551 --> 24:40.068
- If we could develop the tools

24:40.068 --> 24:44.482
to map the psyche of
disturbed individuals,

24:44.482 --> 24:48.551
I believe we could free
them from pain forever.

24:48.551 --> 24:50.896
- [Miles] That's
almost overwhelming.

24:50.896 --> 24:52.000
- [Adam] Are there questions?

24:52.000 --> 24:53.206
- Not specifically.

24:53.206 --> 24:55.275
- [Adam] OK, then,
see you in two weeks.

24:56.206 --> 25:00.344
- [scoffs] OK, thank you.

25:00.344 --> 25:01.517
- By the way,

25:02.758 --> 25:06.655
your friend, Noah,
missed his meeting.

25:06.655 --> 25:08.310
You heard something?

25:10.000 --> 25:12.793
You know something about that?

25:12.793 --> 25:14.275
- I don't really know.

25:14.275 --> 25:17.517
He stopped returning my

25:17.517 --> 25:21.344
[scoffs] It's like
he just disappeared.

25:21.344 --> 25:23.931
- Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

25:23.931 --> 25:27.551
However, you are still here.

25:27.551 --> 25:30.517
Miles, you have a great future.

25:31.862 --> 25:34.620

25:48.103 --> 25:49.931
- [Cheryl] Is it that you
just wanted to hurt me,

25:49.931 --> 25:51.000
or are you just
the kind of person

25:51.000 --> 25:52.931
that likes to hurt people?

25:52.931 --> 25:54.827
You can always go work
at my web training,

25:54.827 --> 25:57.620
I hear they like to sexually
harass their students, too.

26:10.310 --> 26:13.310

26:14.724 --> 26:17.551
- Most of our work is
done sitting at computers,

26:17.551 --> 26:21.000
but the most challenging
is in the field.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.931
- That's the part I
really wanna get into.

26:23.931 --> 26:27.137
- Sexuality, Miles,
is the direct link

26:27.137 --> 26:28.724
to the primal scream.

26:29.793 --> 26:32.724
Orgasm is a little death.

26:32.724 --> 26:35.172
It's only when we
are close to death

26:35.172 --> 26:36.862
that our minds can be pure,

26:36.862 --> 26:39.517
and we need that purity
for our experiments.

26:40.793 --> 26:42.000
- [Miles] I can see that.

26:43.482 --> 26:45.724
- [Adam] I believe you are
ready for the next level.

26:45.724 --> 26:48.620
Make sure you follow
all the instructions

26:48.620 --> 26:50.034

- Hey.

27:03.758 --> 27:05.413
- [Miles] Haven't I
seen you around before?

27:05.413 --> 27:06.689
What's your name?

27:06.689 --> 27:07.517
- Gemini.

27:08.931 --> 27:09.758
- Gemini,

27:11.344 --> 27:12.172
please, come in.

27:17.448 --> 27:19.482
[door crunching]

27:19.482 --> 27:23.241
So, Gemini, is that
your real name?

27:24.724 --> 27:27.448
- We don't wanna talk about
our real names, now, do we?

27:27.448 --> 27:29.034
- Of course not.

27:59.862 --> 28:01.620
What are the pills for?

28:01.620 --> 28:03.655
- You don't need to worry
about that right now.

28:03.655 --> 28:07.827
[rhythmic, vaguely ominous
and eerie electronic music]

28:09.172 --> 28:12.034

to get this thing set up.

28:12.034 --> 28:13.517
[switches clacking]

28:13.517 --> 28:16.448
[sighs] Do you ever get
nervous when you're doin' this?

28:16.448 --> 28:17.758
- [Gemini] That's
another question,

28:17.758 --> 28:20.379
you ask so many questions!

28:20.379 --> 28:21.586
- [Miles] Let's
just get to work.

28:21.586 --> 28:23.103
- You'll do fine.

Hello?

29:05.000 --> 29:06.206

29:06.206 --> 29:07.689
you've gotta come out
and meet me right away.

29:07.689 --> 29:09.896
You remember the spot
where we used to hang out?

29:09.896 --> 29:14.206
[sighs] You've got to come out
right away [sighs], please.

29:14.206 --> 29:15.931
- Fuck, man, it's
four in the morning!

29:15.931 --> 29:17.551
- I need you to do me
this one last favor

29:17.551 --> 29:20.413
if you were ever my fucking
friend, do you understand?

29:20.413 --> 29:21.344
Please!

29:21.344 --> 29:22.620
- This better be serious.

29:22.620 --> 29:23.862
- There's no time
for explanations!

29:23.862 --> 29:25.379
- All right, give
me half an hour.

29:33.206 --> 29:35.827
[tense and ominous

29:35.827 --> 29:37.034
What's goin' on with you,

29:37.034 --> 29:38.758
why'd you wanna meet
all the way out here?

29:38.758 --> 29:40.724
- Copper wiring in the walls.

29:40.724 --> 29:42.862
The transmission
can't be traced here.

29:42.862 --> 29:44.034
This entire place
is a dead zone.

29:44.034 --> 29:45.551
Don't you remember from class?

29:45.551 --> 29:48.689
- Why don't you come back,
finish, get your degree?

29:48.689 --> 29:49.517
- Why?

29:51.586 --> 29:53.000
So I can grow up
and be like you?

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
- So what have you been doing?

29:55.000 --> 29:56.827
- Been collecting things.

29:56.827 --> 29:59.827
Transmissions,
people's testimony,

29:59.827 --> 30:01.758
people who've been damaged.

30:01.758 --> 30:04.068
- So what's so urgent, hmm?

30:04.068 --> 30:06.000
- I intercepted this one
from the Victims Channel.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.620
- What's that?
[tape snapping]

30:08.620 --> 30:10.862
- It's a closed
circuit video blog.

30:10.862 --> 30:12.965
Victims of psychological
torture use it

30:12.965 --> 30:14.620
to communicate with each other.

30:15.793 --> 30:17.551
People who have been
psychologically raped

30:17.551 --> 30:18.758
are on that tape, Dale.

30:18.758 --> 30:20.413
Do you understand how
important that is?

30:20.413 --> 30:22.310
[tense electronic music]

30:22.310 --> 30:23.655
Thank you for coming.

30:23.655 --> 30:27.655
[tense and ominous
electronic music]

30:27.655 --> 30:29.275
[keyboard clacking]

30:29.275 --> 30:31.310
- I could hear his voice.

30:31.310 --> 30:33.206
It was almost like
about five to 10

30:33.206 --> 30:34.793
people or something like that.

30:34.793 --> 30:36.689
All of them kept telling me

30:36.689 --> 30:40.448
a whole bunch of different
things, like how does it feel

30:40.448 --> 30:43.620
to get fucked all the
way through your brains.

30:43.620 --> 30:47.689
I didn't know whether I was
asleep with my eyes closed

30:47.689 --> 30:50.000
and, and everybody
was talking to me,

30:50.000 --> 30:52.724
but they were able to, like,

30:52.724 --> 30:55.172
receive this information
and take it out

30:55.172 --> 30:57.758
and they were also, I
felt like they were trying

30:57.758 --> 31:01.965
to put in, uh, different,
uh, data inside of me

31:01.965 --> 31:04.655
that would make
me destroy myself.

31:06.413 --> 31:08.965
- I would have these
weird aura feelings,

31:08.965 --> 31:10.517
like this real, really weird,

31:10.517 --> 31:13.310
like warm, warmth come over me.

31:13.310 --> 31:15.586
It would start with
the fingertips,

31:15.586 --> 31:18.000
and it would, and
also I could feel it

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
go up through my veins all
the way up into my head

31:21.000 --> 31:22.931
into the back of my eye.

31:22.931 --> 31:27.724
I know there is something being
completely stolen from me.

31:27.724 --> 31:30.724
- Our enemy is a blur.
[tense electronic music]

31:30.724 --> 31:34.896
I mean [sighs], assignments,
I don't trust anybody, really.

31:35.793 --> 31:37.413
[traffic whooshing]

31:37.413 --> 31:39.551
- Science is unpredictable,

31:39.551 --> 31:41.586
but you're the one
who pushed it too far.

31:41.586 --> 31:44.000
- You didn't tell me
she could die from it!

31:44.000 --> 31:47.206
- She had AIDS.

31:47.206 --> 31:48.827
Her time was limited.

31:48.827 --> 31:51.103
I'm sorry about
what has happened,

31:51.103 --> 31:52.793
but we have to take risks.

31:52.793 --> 31:53.965
- No, I'm sorry [sighs].

31:56.000 --> 31:57.310
I don't really feel
like I can be a part

31:57.310 --> 31:58.517
of this project anymore.

31:58.517 --> 31:59.758
- But you agreed.

32:01.103 --> 32:02.310
- You can't prove that.

32:02.310 --> 32:04.517
- Let me tell you something.

32:04.517 --> 32:07.689
I have slept with
many of my students

32:07.689 --> 32:11.793
with no risk of being
reported, no risk at all,

32:11.793 --> 32:15.965
because I record the
girl telling me how
much she wants me.

32:18.310 --> 32:21.275
So I have her
consent on the tape,

32:21.275 --> 32:25.000
like I have yours
concerning our project.

32:26.172 --> 32:28.620
Our future on this
planet is precarious,

32:28.620 --> 32:31.896
and yet we have
to evolve somehow.

32:31.896 --> 32:36.137
To capture the essence of
the human being, his mind,

32:36.137 --> 32:39.034
his personality, come on, Miles!

32:39.034 --> 32:42.000
You worked on the project, you
know what I'm talking about!

32:43.793 --> 32:46.586
I can make this
situation go away.

32:46.586 --> 32:48.344
[tense electronic music]

32:48.344 --> 32:50.862
But you have to help me.

32:50.862 --> 32:52.586
Someone is making threats.

32:52.586 --> 32:56.724
It's a former student of
mine who had some problems,

32:56.724 --> 33:00.000
but I think I have a good
idea how to find her.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.793
- There's one student,
she disappeared,

33:02.793 --> 33:04.241
but we're gonna find her

33:04.241 --> 33:06.689
using technology
we've developed here,

33:06.689 --> 33:09.413
and trust me, we're
all fully committed.

33:09.413 --> 33:12.862
[tense electronic music]

33:15.724 --> 33:18.000
[electronics buzzing
and whirring]

33:18.000 --> 33:19.551
- [Mysterious Woman] But
once, in the olden days,

33:19.551 --> 33:22.379
they used to, um, cut one
arm and then cut one hand,

33:22.379 --> 33:24.000
and then they could travel
and they could speak

33:24.000 --> 33:26.620
to each other by
touching that wound.

33:26.620 --> 33:28.448
When we actually
tested this again,

33:28.448 --> 33:30.586
we took our college, uh, student

33:30.586 --> 33:32.344
and we took some of his blood,

33:32.344 --> 33:34.724
and we had him take a log,

33:34.724 --> 33:36.172
what girlfriend,
what did he eat,

33:36.172 --> 33:37.965
how did he feel, what
type of tests did he take,

33:37.965 --> 33:39.413
what time did he go to sleep,

33:39.413 --> 33:41.241
and for three months,
his blood reacted

33:41.241 --> 33:43.620
to exactly what was going
on with him, exactly.

33:43.620 --> 33:45.689
So in the same ways as blood

33:45.689 --> 33:49.137
holds electricity and waveforms,

33:49.137 --> 33:51.655
they could do the same
thing with another person.

33:51.655 --> 33:55.827
[tense, vaguely eerie
ambient electronic music]

33:57.586 --> 33:59.344
- [Mysterious Man] I knew for
me it was a new beginning.

33:59.344 --> 34:01.620
I felt this power
that was nothing

34:01.620 --> 34:03.275
like I'd ever felt before.

34:03.275 --> 34:05.206
There was nothing that
I couldn't accomplish.

34:05.206 --> 34:06.862
I could do anything.

34:06.862 --> 34:08.862
It filled a hole, a void inside

34:08.862 --> 34:10.379
that I had since I was a child,

34:11.827 --> 34:14.931
but I still knew that I had to
do whatever was asked of me.

34:15.793 --> 34:17.862
I was going to find Cheryl,

34:17.862 --> 34:19.931
otherwise, who knows
what would happen.

34:22.757 --> 34:24.827
- [Dale] Another part
of the facility, huh?

34:24.827 --> 34:26.344
- The way that you
see everything.

34:26.344 --> 34:27.447
- Yeah, it's cool.

34:27.447 --> 34:28.724
- Cameras everywhere.

34:28.724 --> 34:29.551
- Yeah.

34:30.757 --> 34:34.034
- So tell me, how's
your work, tell us.

34:34.034 --> 34:36.034
- Yeah, they're very
good, I'm excited.

34:36.034 --> 34:37.688
I think I'm breaking
through some barriers.

34:37.688 --> 34:38.965
- Good.

34:38.965 --> 34:42.103
Now, do you know what is
the meaning of theater?

34:42.103 --> 34:43.413
- Uh, live theater, like plays?

34:43.413 --> 34:44.241
- [Adam] Yes.

34:44.241 --> 34:45.447
- Entertainment?

34:45.447 --> 34:48.688
- With theater
was born the mask.

34:48.688 --> 34:53.688
It hides the face
of whoever wears it,

34:53.688 --> 34:56.241
his identity, and
at the same time,

34:57.448 --> 34:59.413
the vibration of the brain,

34:59.413 --> 35:03.586
suddenly, this mask
reflects their power.

35:05.931 --> 35:08.103
As a next assignment, Dale,

35:08.103 --> 35:09.931
I want you to wear it.

35:11.275 --> 35:12.965
Meet the divine.

35:13.896 --> 35:15.724
- [Dale] Uh, thank you, I'm, uh,

35:15.724 --> 35:17.482
I'm lookin' forward to this.

35:17.482 --> 35:18.689
- Good.

35:18.689 --> 35:21.310
- [Dale] All right,
yeah, thank you.

35:51.586 --> 35:53.275

35:53.275 --> 35:54.724
[bird fluttering]

35:54.724 --> 35:58.517
[snickers] He looks
really cute, I'm excited.

36:00.931 --> 36:02.620
I get tired of
talkin' to pigeons

36:02.620 --> 36:04.758
all the time, you know, guys?

36:04.758 --> 36:07.000
As cool as you are, no offense.

36:08.275 --> 36:10.379
[rhythmic electronic music]

36:10.379 --> 36:13.206
[Jeanie chuckles]

36:14.275 --> 36:16.517
Be good, OK, watch the fort.

36:17.482 --> 36:19.000
Bye, babies.

36:19.000 --> 36:23.137
[traffic humming over quietly
tense electronic music]

36:28.827 --> 36:30.034
Hey, Dale?

36:31.000 --> 36:31.931
Jeanie.

36:31.931 --> 36:33.689
- Hi, thanks for coming out.

36:34.862 --> 36:36.724
- You're even better
looking in person.

36:37.896 --> 36:40.896
- So are you, so, you
wanna go somewhere?

36:40.896 --> 36:43.275
- [Jeanie] Yeah, totally,
where do you wanna go?

36:44.482 --> 36:48.000
- Um, oh, I figured
I'm just kind of a,

36:49.517 --> 36:51.413
I'm stressed out, I'm
a, I'm a psych student.

36:51.413 --> 36:52.655
I've been doin' a lot
of studying, you know,

36:52.655 --> 36:54.724
so I'm just, uh, a
little overwhelmed.

36:54.724 --> 36:57.000
- Yeah, man,
school's killing me.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.241
I'm doing internet marketing.

36:58.241 --> 37:00.758
- [Dale] Wow, that sounds heavy.

37:00.758 --> 37:03.965
- Yeah, it's a lotta
work, a lotta work.

37:03.965 --> 37:05.206
- [Dale] So you understand
what I'm sayin'?

37:05.206 --> 37:08.172
- Totally, hey, do have
anything to get high?

37:08.172 --> 37:10.965
- [scoffs] Uh, depends on
what you get high with.

37:10.965 --> 37:13.827
- Uh, well, I'm feelin'
like a, a downer,

37:13.827 --> 37:17.517
like, um, vikes or oxies
or somethin', you know?

37:17.517 --> 37:19.379
Somethin' to just chill,
chill me out [chuckles].

37:19.379 --> 37:20.655
- Yeah, I've got
a bad back, so I,

37:20.655 --> 37:23.172
I think I've got 30
milligram oxycodone.

37:23.172 --> 37:24.137
- [Jeanie] What?

37:24.137 --> 37:25.103
- I do.

37:25.103 --> 37:26.034
- Oh, man.
- I do.

37:26.034 --> 37:28.000
- 30 milli, that's awesome, yes!

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
- It's better than 10.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.068
- [chuckles] Yeah, it is!

37:31.068 --> 37:32.344
Wow, they look real.

37:32.344 --> 37:33.551
- They're real.

37:33.551 --> 37:34.379
- Eh, I don't like
to take stuff that's,

37:34.379 --> 37:35.965
you know, bad for me.

37:35.965 --> 37:37.172
- [Dale] Yeah, no, I understand.

37:37.172 --> 37:38.448
- [Jeanie] This is
cool, this'll just--

37:38.448 --> 37:40.034
- [Dale] Be careful
drinking, you know?

37:40.034 --> 37:42.517
- Eh, gimme a minute.

37:42.517 --> 37:43.689
- There you go.

37:43.689 --> 37:45.448
[rhythmic electronic music]

37:45.448 --> 37:47.275
So, do you like cam sex?

37:47.275 --> 37:49.172
- [scoffs] Sometimes, yeah.

37:49.172 --> 37:52.000
- Sometimes, I like
masks, you know?

37:52.000 --> 37:54.206
Plays out your
subconscious, your id.

37:55.137 --> 37:56.689
- [Jeanie] Your id?

37:56.689 --> 37:58.827
- Desire for love and sex,
controlled by your libido,

37:58.827 --> 38:00.965
and then the desire for
death and aggression.

38:00.965 --> 38:02.862
These two competing
instincts, you know,

38:02.862 --> 38:05.586
build up in the id
causing tension,

38:06.689 --> 38:08.448
and you gotta
release that tension.

38:09.517 --> 38:11.000
- [Jeanie] Wow!
- You feel me?

38:11.000 --> 38:13.517
- [chuckles] I'm all about
releasing tension right now.

38:13.517 --> 38:14.793
- [Dale] Yeah, absolutely.

38:15.724 --> 38:17.275
[engine rumbling]

38:17.275 --> 38:19.068
The journey begins.

38:19.068 --> 38:20.482
- [Jeanie] I'm excited.

38:20.482 --> 38:23.620
So ready, I could fuckin'
use a cool change.

38:23.620 --> 38:24.896
- [Dale] Oh, it's gonna be cool.

38:24.896 --> 38:26.482
[Jeanie laughs]

38:26.482 --> 38:28.586
All right, Jeanie, I have
something to ask you.

38:28.586 --> 38:30.103
- Ask me.

38:30.103 --> 38:31.344
- [Dale] How would you feel

38:31.344 --> 38:32.689
if you I wanted you
to be blindfolded?

38:34.137 --> 38:35.310
- Uh--

38:35.310 --> 38:36.517
- [Dale] Would
that freak you out?

38:36.517 --> 38:38.379
- No, man, that's kinda
kinky, I'm into it.

38:38.379 --> 38:39.620
- You up for it.

38:39.620 --> 38:41.000
- All right, I, I feel
like I gotta trust you.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.827
You seem, like, you know, kinky.

38:42.827 --> 38:44.103

40:44.413 --> 40:45.206
- Dale!

40:46.965 --> 40:49.103
- I saw that tape,
it made me sick, man.

40:49.103 --> 40:50.137
- C'mere.

40:50.137 --> 40:51.862
Look at my eye.

40:51.862 --> 40:53.965
Here, right by the pupil, look.

40:53.965 --> 40:54.827
- There's nothing in your eye.

40:54.827 --> 40:56.068
- I know.

40:56.068 --> 40:56.965
- [Dale] Just, what
are talking about?

40:56.965 --> 40:58.448
- Shh, shh!

40:58.448 --> 40:59.379
- All right.

40:59.379 --> 41:01.241
- Just look, right there.

41:01.241 --> 41:02.379
- [Dale] All right,
listen, listen.

41:02.379 --> 41:03.586
- Just look!

41:03.586 --> 41:04.758
- Listen, you've
been awake too long.

41:04.758 --> 41:06.275
Look, there's
nothing in your eye!

41:06.275 --> 41:08.517
I promise you, there's
nothing in your eye.

what I can find out, OK?

41:37.620 --> 41:41.586
You're fine, all right?
[Noah sighs]

41:41.586 --> 41:43.000
It's all in your head.

that you can't do
anything without it.

42:08.689 --> 42:12.034
I remember I was bleeding
from under my nails,

42:12.034 --> 42:14.172
so I electrocuted myself.

42:14.172 --> 42:15.413
I'd been on the phone a lot,

42:15.413 --> 42:17.344
and I started thinking
these crazy thoughts

42:17.344 --> 42:21.000
like is it, is it the phone

42:21.000 --> 42:22.965
I've been holding to
this side of my head,

42:22.965 --> 42:26.206
and is it doing
something to me, like.

42:26.206 --> 42:28.689
[ominous and eerie
ambient electronic music]

42:28.689 --> 42:30.000
- You're a victim.

42:30.000 --> 42:33.517
You were his victim,
he's sick, I'm sorry.

42:33.517 --> 42:35.517
I'm sorry for my sicknesses.

42:57.896 --> 42:59.689

43:01.000 --> 43:02.241
- [Tristan] OK.

43:05.413 --> 43:08.413
[keyboard clacking]

43:08.413 --> 43:09.965
- [Adam] You found anything?

43:09.965 --> 43:11.655
- No, there's been
a lotta action,

43:11.655 --> 43:15.620
just, uh, none that you
might be looking for [sighs].

43:17.586 --> 43:20.310
- Well, then work harder.

43:22.620 --> 43:24.310
I'll come check
with you tomorrow.

43:28.965 --> 43:31.413
- Listen, you don't have
to obsess so hard, sir.

43:31.413 --> 43:32.896
I've got the data,

43:32.896 --> 43:36.034
and I'm analyzing it with,
with all the records we have.

43:36.034 --> 43:38.241
I mean, if I find a
match, I'll tell you.

43:39.655 --> 43:42.896
- I don't like to repeat myself.

43:42.896 --> 43:45.551
[electronics buzzing over

43:55.896 --> 43:59.896
[ominous and unsettling

44:01.310 --> 44:02.965
- You've got the sensitivities
to psychological disorders.

44:02.965 --> 44:04.241
It creates an obscenity

[whirring electronic

44:09.034 --> 44:13.310
Concentrated exposure can, can
lead to heart irregularities

44:13.310 --> 44:17.000
and cancer, brain
tumors, just look.

44:19.379 --> 44:22.137
It can actually alter
your, your, your DNA.

44:22.137 --> 44:23.482
I mean restructure,

44:23.482 --> 44:26.586
essentially, uh, rewire
the human genome.

made available at any cost.

44:32.758 --> 44:34.000

44:34.000 --> 44:36.862

like a family to me!

44:36.862 --> 44:39.344
Don't you understand that,
don't you understand that?

44:39.344 --> 44:40.827
They were like a family to me!

44:40.827 --> 44:42.068
You know how important that is,

44:42.068 --> 44:44.206
that's all I ever wanted!

44:44.206 --> 44:46.517
Maybe you don't care,
maybe you don't,

44:46.517 --> 44:49.103
but that's all I ever wanted!

44:49.103 --> 44:51.344
Can't you guys
both respect that?

44:51.344 --> 44:54.137
Shut up, shut up,

44:54.137 --> 44:56.655
you pussy!

44:56.655 --> 44:58.586
You'd be suckin' dick
if it wasn't for me,

44:58.586 --> 45:00.172
wouldn't you, wouldn't you?

45:00.172 --> 45:02.620
If it were up to you,
we'd be serial killers?

45:02.620 --> 45:04.931
That's not the
point, you understand

45:04.931 --> 45:06.931
what type of position
we're in right now, right?

45:06.931 --> 45:08.827
Fuck you!

45:08.827 --> 45:11.000
What, do you wanna hit me,
do you want me to hit you?

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Don't touch him,
leave him alone.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.448
Fuckin' put your finger on my
face, put me up one more time!

45:15.448 --> 45:16.275
[gun clicking]

45:16.275 --> 45:17.413
Stop it, just calm down.

45:18.275 --> 45:20.586
Leave him alone, just calm down!

45:23.000 --> 45:25.379
OK, do you agree that I'm
the voice of reason here?

45:25.379 --> 45:28.344
I'm trying, didn't
I just try, right?

45:28.344 --> 45:31.000
We have got an open
mind, all of us.

45:31.000 --> 45:32.620
We've gotta listen to each other

45:32.620 --> 45:34.379
and understand where
each one is coming from.

45:34.379 --> 45:36.793
Everyone here is
trying to make sense.

45:36.793 --> 45:39.206
If you just would listen to
him, I will listen to you,

45:39.206 --> 45:41.000
and you listen to
me, we have a chance!

45:41.000 --> 45:42.620
Help me out, man!

45:42.620 --> 45:47.310
I understand, I respect you,
just help me out, man, please!

I'm talkin' to nobody!

been part of the program,

46:07.344 --> 46:10.448
and the files go back for years.

46:10.448 --> 46:13.068
He, he keeps old
cellphones around.

46:13.068 --> 46:15.793
I mean, why would
he keep this old,

46:15.793 --> 46:17.827
outdated technology
around, is, is,

46:19.103 --> 46:21.103
I, I think it might
have something to do

46:21.103 --> 46:23.827
with the frequency of the
phone, can't be duplicated

46:23.827 --> 46:27.827

I don't [sighs],

46:53.793 --> 46:55.000
I don't know what it is.

46:57.000 --> 47:00.172
- And did you do
everything I told you?

47:00.172 --> 47:01.724
- I injected them with the dye,

47:01.724 --> 47:04.172
and then I did everything
the way you showed me.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.586
- Well, then, I'll have to
come back again tomorrow.

47:09.793 --> 47:12.862
Oh, by the way, did
you get the order?

47:14.137 --> 47:16.862

I was thinking,

I maybe get one of those?

feeding us in there?

I don't know, they were, like,
some other kind of ambulance,

52:27.862 --> 52:32.620
and once I, at the hospital,
I don't know exactly when,

52:32.620 --> 52:34.103
what happened to me, I mean,

52:34.103 --> 52:37.344
they say that they stick
their finger up your, uh,

52:37.344 --> 52:40.586

they did stick
something, um, in there.

They're trying to fucking kill
me with invisible waveforms.

are still out there.

53:50.620 --> 53:52.206
I have it all back
up into the cloud,

56:33.896 --> 56:36.000
are you proud of what
you've accomplished?

56:36.000 --> 56:37.379
- What do you mean?

56:37.379 --> 56:40.689
Somebody's gotta infiltrate,
see what's going on.

56:40.689 --> 56:42.758
You're certainly
not doin' it, Noah.

56:42.758 --> 56:44.206
Somebody's gotta
be on the inside.

56:44.206 --> 56:47.551
- On the inside, they
are on the inside of you.

56:47.551 --> 56:48.620
- What the fuck are
you talking about,

56:48.620 --> 56:49.620
they're on the inside of me?

56:49.620 --> 56:51.310
Let me ask you something.

56:51.310 --> 56:54.310
Do you think you can take
them on on your own, huh?

56:54.310 --> 56:57.068
You need me as
much as I need you.

56:57.068 --> 56:58.172
- Did you find
out what it's like

56:58.172 --> 56:59.827
when they're done using you?

56:59.827 --> 57:01.344
They'll tell you what to do,

57:01.344 --> 57:02.310
because there's no getting away.

57:02.310 --> 57:03.931
Not in this pathetic life.

57:07.689 --> 57:09.241
You gotta trust somebody.

57:09.241 --> 57:13.724
[buzzing electronic tones

57:13.724 --> 57:15.965
If anything happens
to me, anything,

57:15.965 --> 57:19.758
I'm gonna put a special
package for you right here.

57:19.758 --> 57:21.862
- [Dale] What are you
talking about, Noah?

57:23.241 --> 57:26.586
- This is everything I've
collected so far, do you get it?

57:26.586 --> 57:30.758
This is all the tapes, my
tapes, the victims' tapes,

57:32.034 --> 57:35.000
this is my life, and
I am giving it to you.

57:37.000 --> 57:37.965
- [Dale] If something
happens to me,

57:37.965 --> 57:39.172
what do you want me to do?

57:39.172 --> 57:42.275
[tense, pulsing

57:42.275 --> 57:43.965
- If that time ever comes,

57:43.965 --> 57:46.103
[scoffs] look inside
the briefcase.

57:46.103 --> 57:47.620
You're gonna find
some information.

57:47.620 --> 57:49.137
Follow the instructions exactly

57:49.137 --> 57:50.965
then destroy any extra
copies to make sure

57:50.965 --> 57:52.551
that the feds don't get them,
do you understand me, Dale?

57:52.551 --> 57:56.413
- Yeah, if that time comes,

57:56.413 --> 57:58.000
you can trust in me.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.034
- How long have we
known each other?

58:00.034 --> 58:02.068
- [Dale] Long time, why?

58:02.068 --> 58:05.241
- Remember I was so
idealistic that I,

58:05.241 --> 58:07.448
now you're working
on secret patents

58:07.448 --> 58:11.137
and I'm doing, well, this shit.

58:15.379 --> 58:16.724
We're still friends, right?

58:16.724 --> 58:18.586
- Yeah, of course we're friends.

58:18.586 --> 58:20.379
We'll always be close.

58:20.379 --> 58:21.620

- [Hooded Man] I can't
show you who I am!

01:00:27.448 --> 01:00:28.689
Let me see your face!

01:00:28.689 --> 01:00:29.655

an administrator

01:00:29.655 --> 01:00:31.137
for the Victims Channel.

01:00:31.137 --> 01:00:34.103
I can't show you my face,
I have to be anonymous.

01:00:35.551 --> 01:00:37.758
- Blog dude from the,
from the Victims Channel?

01:00:37.758 --> 01:00:39.482

You, you need to
process all of this!

01:00:48.793 --> 01:00:51.551
This is where, this is where
they test it on the victims,

everything comes from here!

01:00:56.172 --> 01:00:58.758

- [Victims Channel Rep]
Just tell your story.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.103
- The test started off
with whenever we get a

01:01:10.103 --> 01:01:13.000
person who came into the
psychiatric part of the school.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.034
We would, um, first
inject them with this dye,

01:01:16.034 --> 01:01:17.862
I thought it was a
dye, which later on,

01:01:17.862 --> 01:01:22.000
I come to find out is a, some
kind of nanotechnology liquid

01:01:23.689 --> 01:01:26.379
that's not even classified
to use on people,

01:01:26.379 --> 01:01:28.275
but it makes it so we can see

01:01:28.275 --> 01:01:30.448
how the synapses
of the brain are,

01:01:30.448 --> 01:01:33.758
are communicating with that
part of the body at that moment.

01:01:33.758 --> 01:01:36.241
The ultimate goal is
to create a weapon

01:01:36.241 --> 01:01:38.310
that doesn't even
kill people but,

01:01:40.206 --> 01:01:42.344
it can wipe out
massive amounts of,

01:01:42.344 --> 01:01:46.482
of, of brain frequency
and basically turn
people into sheep.

met you in the library.

01:02:14.310 --> 01:02:15.793
I, I really did like you.

01:02:16.793 --> 01:02:18.000
Wow.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.586
- Adam Whitney, I
wrote this book.

01:02:19.586 --> 01:02:20.862
- Cheryl.

01:02:20.862 --> 01:02:23.068
I was so stupid to think
you were a nice person.

01:02:24.275 --> 01:02:25.758
You know, I thought
we could get along,

01:02:25.758 --> 01:02:28.482
but if you didn't want me,
you should've just let me go.

01:02:28.482 --> 01:02:30.896
[button clicks]

01:02:30.896 --> 01:02:33.482
- They've tapped into
the, the whole grid

01:02:34.586 --> 01:02:36.034
where if she comes within

01:02:37.482 --> 01:02:40.482
any of those cameras, and
we, we get glimpses of her,

01:02:40.482 --> 01:02:43.689
and we can pick up on her
waveform, but then she's gone.

01:02:43.689 --> 01:02:47.517
If somehow they're able
to, uh, find her frequency

01:02:47.517 --> 01:02:50.482
or whatever it is that's
leaving the messages,

01:02:50.482 --> 01:02:53.172
then more people are gonna die.

01:02:53.172 --> 01:02:58.000
I mean, there's no evidence
the, that the woman is real.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.827
She could just be some cloud

01:03:00.827 --> 01:03:04.896
just drifting through the
wires, through the fiberoptics,

01:03:04.896 --> 01:03:06.689
and, and, and theoretically,

01:03:06.689 --> 01:03:09.206
she could be implanted
into someone else's mind,

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:13.827
and I think that that's what
he's the most afraid of.

01:03:13.827 --> 01:03:15.517
If, if, if this doesn't get out,

01:03:15.517 --> 01:03:18.275
more people will be
missing, you know?

01:03:18.275 --> 01:03:20.586
More tests'll be done, but
people don't know that.

He's not buying
anything, you know?

[eerie and ominous

01:08:51.482 --> 01:08:53.379
- I read this thing
recently about the dinosaurs

01:08:53.379 --> 01:08:56.033
becoming extinct is because
they found this iridium

01:08:56.033 --> 01:08:59.412
that was along the, it
was all along the fossils,

01:08:59.412 --> 01:09:01.033
that it's not found,
like, on Earth.

01:09:01.033 --> 01:09:02.895
It's, like, they find
it in outer space, yeah,

01:09:02.895 --> 01:09:04.136
so they found that,
like, the earth,

01:09:04.136 --> 01:09:05.758
there must've been these
meteorites or something

01:09:05.758 --> 01:09:08.586
coming from outer
space that made the,

01:09:08.586 --> 01:09:10.379
that eradicated the dinosaurs.

01:09:10.379 --> 01:09:13.654
- Yeah, that's their
life, you know that.

01:09:13.654 --> 01:09:16.344
- So, I really like this part
here that she has to say.

01:09:16.344 --> 01:09:18.206
This chapter about how
to make experiments

01:09:18.206 --> 01:09:20.724
with biological
transmutation successful.

01:09:20.724 --> 01:09:21.827
Like, that's really interesting,

01:09:21.827 --> 01:09:23.792
it's, like,
one-of-a-kind research.

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:25.654
- You know, it's just research.

01:09:25.654 --> 01:09:28.586
Two plus two equals four.

01:09:28.586 --> 01:09:29.930

Do you maybe wanna
get out of here,

01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:34.033
maybe go to my
place for a drink?

01:09:34.033 --> 01:09:36.103
- Very sweet, but
I can't, I can't.

01:09:36.103 --> 01:09:37.448
I have to go back
to the project.

01:09:37.448 --> 01:09:39.274
It takes all of my free time.

01:09:39.274 --> 01:09:40.930
- Maybe I could come with you?

01:09:40.930 --> 01:09:43.654
I'd really like to see what
you've been working on.

01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:47.792
- [Adam] You sure?
[rhythmic electro rock music]

01:09:47.792 --> 01:09:50.586
- [Cheryl] Yeah, I'm totally
sure, I'd really like to go.

01:09:52.241 --> 01:09:53.895
- OK, let's pick up my car.

01:09:53.895 --> 01:09:54.862

place is amazing!

01:10:14.344 --> 01:10:16.413
- My lab, and I'm proud of it.

01:10:16.413 --> 01:10:19.413
- So, Adam, do you
have any children?

01:10:19.413 --> 01:10:21.655
- I always dream
of having a family,

01:10:21.655 --> 01:10:23.758
but you know how it is
once you get married.

01:10:23.758 --> 01:10:25.517
50 percent of your
time for the wife,

01:10:25.517 --> 01:10:27.275
50 percent of your
time for the kids,

01:10:27.275 --> 01:10:30.137
another 50 percent for
the career, what's left?

01:10:30.137 --> 01:10:34.310
So I focus on my work,
and in some ways,

01:10:36.137 --> 01:10:38.758
my students are my children.

01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:45.758
[door rattling over

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.103
What you are about to see I
shouldn't really show to nobody.

01:10:52.103 --> 01:10:53.137
You understand that?

01:10:53.137 --> 01:10:55.034
- Yeah, you make
me feel special.

01:10:55.034 --> 01:10:59.103
- Here, here we see the cutting
edge of mind technology.

01:11:01.482 --> 01:11:03.862
Nobody's authorized
to do this but me.

01:11:03.862 --> 01:11:05.586
Everything here, all the labs,

01:11:05.586 --> 01:11:09.482
the whole project is being
financed by the government.

01:11:09.482 --> 01:11:11.379
There are special
parts of this program

01:11:11.379 --> 01:11:13.482
that I have to do
separate from the school

01:11:14.862 --> 01:11:16.758
so that there is
no interference.

01:11:16.758 --> 01:11:18.034
- What is this place?

01:11:18.034 --> 01:11:19.965
- It's OK, I'm the
only one to use it.

01:11:21.103 --> 01:11:24.241
To tell you the truth,
I really need your help.

01:11:25.172 --> 01:11:26.655
- What do you mean?

01:11:26.655 --> 01:11:30.275
- I have to record
a human waveform.

01:11:30.275 --> 01:11:31.172
- You mean the bioplasma?

01:11:31.172 --> 01:11:32.655
- Yes, exactly!

01:11:32.655 --> 01:11:35.000
And I need someone
as dedicated as I am

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.758
to be able to analyze
it completely.

01:11:38.724 --> 01:11:40.586
- What do you need me to do?

I'm gonna end up killing myself,

01:12:47.413 --> 01:12:49.827
can you please help
me out, Dale, please?

never wanted to be, OK?

01:12:54.172 --> 01:12:55.689
Ask him when we talk.

That's the whole reason that
we're even in this mess!

Does anyone here understand me?

01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:02.068
It's not about pers, Dale,

01:13:02.068 --> 01:13:03.689
it's not about personal issues!

01:13:03.689 --> 01:13:05.517

Can't you understand that?

we could be unstoppable!

OK, what do you want me to do?

01:13:22.482 --> 01:13:24.448
Do you want me to be
somebody that I'm not?

that you know more about
how to live life than I do,

No, see, you people just
have this need to manipulate

and children in placements
are, uh, prime targets.

01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:36.793
You can get a child
out of a placement,

01:18:36.793 --> 01:18:39.000
mind control it, and
then bring it back.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.517
Nobody knows the difference,

01:18:40.517 --> 01:18:44.206
so later on in life, when they
need to fast-track somebody,

01:18:44.206 --> 01:18:46.413
they use these people that
they've mind controlled

01:18:46.413 --> 01:18:48.758
earlier in their life
when they were young.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.172
- Do you guys realize
that if we get caught,

01:18:52.172 --> 01:18:54.103
we're going to prison forever!

01:18:55.482 --> 01:18:56.689
I'd rather be dead.

01:18:56.689 --> 01:18:58.724
Fuckin' A, man, we gotta
pull this together!

01:18:58.724 --> 01:19:00.482
I'd definitely
rather you be dead!

01:19:00.482 --> 01:19:03.137
This should've been decided
an hour ago, am I right?

01:19:03.137 --> 01:19:05.758
Listen, you listen,
everybody in the world,

01:19:05.758 --> 01:19:07.379
every person is different.

01:19:07.379 --> 01:19:09.172
Everybody has a
different purpose,

01:19:09.172 --> 01:19:10.793
everyone has a different reason.

01:19:10.793 --> 01:19:13.137
I'm already dead, guys!

01:19:13.137 --> 01:19:15.310
OK, guys, let's come together!

01:19:15.310 --> 01:19:17.793
You, you, let's come
together, look at me!

01:19:17.793 --> 01:19:22.275
Look at me, look at me,
let's pull it together, OK?

01:19:22.275 --> 01:19:23.517
Are you with me, huh?

01:19:23.517 --> 01:19:25.689
We can do it, you
can do it, come on!

01:19:25.689 --> 01:19:27.620
Yeah, it's the best idea
I've ever heard, let's go.

01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:30.862
Right now, let's fuckin' do it!

01:19:30.862 --> 01:19:32.482
[metal creaking]

01:19:32.482 --> 01:19:36.655
[computer buzzing over
eerie pulsing ambient music]

01:19:43.482 --> 01:19:44.448
[muffled rattling]

01:19:44.448 --> 01:19:45.758
[buzzing alarm tones]

01:19:45.758 --> 01:19:47.241
[static crackling]

01:19:47.241 --> 01:19:51.241
[insects chirping over eerie
and ominous ambient music]

01:19:56.310 --> 01:19:58.896
[gun rattling]

01:20:01.827 --> 01:20:05.379
- Look at who I
am, look at me now!

01:20:05.379 --> 01:20:08.172
- Neither of us knew
what could happen.

01:20:08.172 --> 01:20:09.655
- You were always the expert!

01:20:09.655 --> 01:20:12.137
You knew this
could happen to me!

01:20:12.137 --> 01:20:15.275
[gunshots cracking]

01:20:15.275 --> 01:20:17.724
[insects chirping]

01:20:17.724 --> 01:20:18.931
[static buzzing]

01:20:18.931 --> 01:20:21.068
You didn't kill me,
'cause I'm already dead!

01:20:22.068 --> 01:20:24.103
[gun rattling]

01:20:24.103 --> 01:20:28.862
[tense ambient electronic music]

01:20:28.862 --> 01:20:30.724
- [Miles] You like
to torture people!

01:20:32.413 --> 01:20:33.379
- [Adam] What?

01:20:33.379 --> 01:20:34.689
- You like to study pain!

01:20:34.689 --> 01:20:35.655
- [Adam] Hey, hey,
hey, I-I-I didn't,

01:20:35.655 --> 01:20:37.379
I don't want to hurt nobody!

01:20:37.379 --> 01:20:38.655
Stop, stop, stop it, stop it.

01:20:38.655 --> 01:20:40.689
Come on, come on!
- And neither did I.

01:20:40.689 --> 01:20:43.827
[engine rumbling over tense
ambient electronic music]

01:20:43.827 --> 01:20:46.827
[gun cocking]

01:20:46.827 --> 01:20:48.517
[car door crunching]

01:20:48.517 --> 01:20:50.827
[gate clanging]

01:20:50.827 --> 01:20:53.103
[tense ambient music]

01:20:53.103 --> 01:20:54.448
- Look, look, you
don't understand.

01:20:54.448 --> 01:20:56.448
I was just trying to
purify their souls

01:20:56.448 --> 01:20:59.310
for our experiment,
you know that!

01:20:59.310 --> 01:21:00.724
I am not a bad person.

01:21:01.724 --> 01:21:03.068
- Maybe I'm a bad person.

01:21:03.068 --> 01:21:04.896
[gunshot cracking]

01:21:04.896 --> 01:21:07.862
It's only when we're close
to death that our minds are--

01:21:07.862 --> 01:21:09.448
- Please, please, please
don't, don't shoot!

01:21:09.448 --> 01:21:11.482
I-I'm, please, no-no, please!
- Don't, don't what?

01:21:11.482 --> 01:21:12.689
[gunshot cracking]

01:21:12.689 --> 01:21:16.379
- No, no, no, no!
[Adam groans]

01:21:16.379 --> 01:21:20.551
[gasping] Wait [gasps], wait!

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.172
Wait [gasps], you
did it [gasping].

01:21:27.758 --> 01:21:31.931
Cheryl did, it
worked, it worked!

01:21:33.172 --> 01:21:35.241
[gun clicking]

01:21:35.241 --> 01:21:36.482
They're gonna come after us,

01:21:36.482 --> 01:21:39.000
they're gonna find out
everything about us!

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.379
They're gonna find
out everything!

01:21:41.379 --> 01:21:42.931
- I burned all my files, Dale.

01:21:44.448 --> 01:21:47.758
I suggest you do the same.
[gun rattling]

01:21:47.758 --> 01:21:49.482
[distant siren blaring]

01:21:49.482 --> 01:21:51.413
- [Dale] What's the
matter with you?

01:21:51.413 --> 01:21:52.896
What's the matter with you!

01:21:52.896 --> 01:21:54.172
- See ya around.

01:21:55.620 --> 01:22:00.034
[Dale gasping over eerie
and ominous ambient music]

01:22:00.034 --> 01:22:01.896
[tense pulsing electronic music]

01:22:01.896 --> 01:22:03.931
[keyboard clacking]

01:22:03.931 --> 01:22:08.000
[tense pulsing electronic music]

01:22:12.068 --> 01:22:15.724
[electronic buzzing]

01:22:15.724 --> 01:22:19.413
[tense pulsing electronic music]

01:22:19.413 --> 01:22:21.275
- I was embarrassed in
front of a bunch of people.

01:22:21.275 --> 01:22:23.655
I looked like a goddamn fool,

01:22:23.655 --> 01:22:26.827
and I don't know why because
I didn't do anything to you.

01:22:26.827 --> 01:22:28.689
Maybe you're just sadistic.

01:22:28.689 --> 01:22:30.379
You ruined my life.
[buzzing electronic tones]

01:22:30.379 --> 01:22:33.586
[buzzing and skittering
electronic tones]

01:22:33.586 --> 01:22:37.758
[buzzing electronic tones
over clattering percussion]

01:22:41.379 --> 01:22:43.655
- Preserve it, man,
preserve it for us!

01:22:43.655 --> 01:22:46.172
Preserve for it for
the fucking guinea pigs

01:22:46.172 --> 01:22:49.758
who've been psychologically
raped, day in, day out.

01:22:49.758 --> 01:22:54.724
[gasps] My frequency's
unknown, man.

01:22:54.724 --> 01:22:55.482
Please.

01:23:00.206 --> 01:23:01.310
- [Mysterious Woman]
There is a theory

01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:02.896
that there is an entity

01:23:02.896 --> 01:23:05.000
that created all
electroneurologic
field of information.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
It could actually
create holograms,

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.137
become entities in
front of your face.

01:23:09.137 --> 01:23:10.931
Call you up on the telephone,

01:23:10.931 --> 01:23:12.724
replicate any voice pattern,

01:23:12.724 --> 01:23:14.931
whether they be your
friends or parents.

01:23:14.931 --> 01:23:18.000
They can have complete
control of all your computers.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.586
You can't get away from it.

01:23:19.586 --> 01:23:22.931
[ominous ambient music]

01:23:26.448 --> 01:23:30.620
[footsteps clacking over
ominous ambient music]

01:23:31.758 --> 01:23:35.896
[ominous and eerie
ambient music]

01:23:37.034 --> 01:23:41.206
[traffic humming over
eerie ambient music]

01:23:44.241 --> 01:23:47.172
[Tristan coughing]

01:23:48.275 --> 01:23:51.275
[traffic whooshing]

01:23:53.206 --> 01:23:57.310
[traffic whooshing over
tense electronic music]

01:23:58.655 --> 01:24:00.655
- [Tristan] Gotta
listen now, everybody!

01:24:01.965 --> 01:24:05.172
They're stalking
us, Victims Channel!

01:24:06.103 --> 01:24:07.241
[wheelchair rattling]

01:24:07.241 --> 01:24:10.379
[groans] Shit [groans]!

01:24:10.379 --> 01:24:13.206
[Tristan gasping]

01:24:14.137 --> 01:24:16.793
I gotta get back up, OK.

01:24:16.793 --> 01:24:19.965
It's not too late,
gotta listen to me!

01:24:21.413 --> 01:24:23.000
Listen to me!

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.241
[traffic humming over
ominous ambient music]

01:24:26.241 --> 01:24:28.793
[ominous ambient music]

01:24:28.793 --> 01:24:30.620
- [Cheryl] My phone
is disconnected.

01:24:30.620 --> 01:24:34.793
Did you want to see me, you
know where I am, goodbye.

01:24:36.103 --> 01:24:40.275
[Cheryl laughing over
ominous ambient music]

01:24:41.551 --> 01:24:43.827
