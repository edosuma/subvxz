WEBVTT

00:01.429 --> 00:03.104
I've
got it again.

00:03.137 --> 00:05.072
This is 17 seven.

00:05.106 --> 00:08.142
Confirm, the
object appears stationary.

00:08.175 --> 00:11.845
It's 2.5
miles off my nose right now.

00:11.878 --> 00:13.780
17,000 feet.

00:13.813 --> 00:15.016
Copy that, Tom,

00:15.049 --> 00:16.317
I could not make out
what it was.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.684
You
didn't see it?

00:17.717 --> 00:18.952
Confirm.

00:18.985 --> 00:23.757
All right,
I'm gonna circle back around.

00:48.848 --> 00:49.716
Hey.

00:59.859 --> 01:00.994
I'll follow you guys.

01:01.028 --> 01:02.329
I'll see you in town.

01:02.363 --> 01:04.964
You're buying.

01:19.646 --> 01:21.315
We're detecting
activity in the outer rim.

01:21.348 --> 01:22.383
Lot's cleared.

01:22.416 --> 01:23.650
Move to co-op.

01:32.059 --> 01:32.892
We're picking up three, sir.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.161
All
trucks respond?

01:34.195 --> 01:36.030
Permission to send recourse.

01:37.098 --> 01:37.964
Permission granted.

01:37.997 --> 01:39.799
Dispatching backup to
sector three,

01:39.833 --> 01:41.202
units approaching fast.

02:05.459 --> 02:08.095
God, you guys okay?!

02:08.129 --> 02:09.196
You guys okay?

02:10.697 --> 02:13.134
Confirming, heavy activity
is now within range.

02:13.167 --> 02:15.169
Standby on all below
line systems,

02:15.202 --> 02:16.203
go on all above.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.207
It's okay.

02:34.288 --> 02:35.189
We need to move!

02:35.222 --> 02:37.690
I repeat, move on all
above line systems

02:37.724 --> 02:38.992
to sector three!

05:22.256 --> 05:24.124
Hey, it's your turn.

05:39.206 --> 05:41.542
It may or may not be encrypted.

05:42.609 --> 05:44.144
Never stopped me before.

05:46.647 --> 05:49.483
836, 14.5.

05:50.484 --> 05:51.518
Nope, that's Jupiter.

05:53.187 --> 05:54.221
It's not in Leo.

06:02.229 --> 06:03.564
Found it.

06:03.597 --> 06:04.431
Whoah.

06:04.465 --> 06:07.267
That is way too fast.

06:08.669 --> 06:13.207
185442.8 by negative
21.2 and 20.2.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.376
It was right in front of Pluto.

06:15.409 --> 06:16.543
That is awesome.

06:17.444 --> 06:18.978
Except it's not me.

06:19.012 --> 06:20.114
What?

06:20.147 --> 06:21.014
Hold on.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.053
What are you guys doing?

06:26.086 --> 06:27.521
It's that signal from Canada.

06:28.655 --> 06:29.523
Really?

06:32.292 --> 06:32.892
That's not you?

06:32.925 --> 06:33.827
Yeah, that's that signal

06:33.861 --> 06:35.962
I've been telling you
about from Canada.

06:35.995 --> 06:36.996
You know, we keep getting it

06:37.030 --> 06:40.234
but there's no grounded
satellites over there.

06:40.267 --> 06:42.169
Oh, it's this game we have going

06:42.202 --> 06:44.171
where I made an audio
file and I send it

06:44.204 --> 06:45.172
and he tries to find it.

06:45.205 --> 06:47.341
He made one, vice versa.

06:47.374 --> 06:48.208
We're tied.

06:48.242 --> 06:49.109
I'm ahead by one.

06:50.277 --> 06:52.045
Using our satellites?

06:52.079 --> 06:53.380
Yeah.

06:53.414 --> 06:55.315
Yeah I don't see
anything there either.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.485
Should we send it from Cassini?

06:58.519 --> 06:59.219
Sure.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.125
Paging ET, please phone home.

07:05.159 --> 07:07.294
ET, will you phone home?

07:07.327 --> 07:08.995
Paging Beck and Isaac.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.164
What?

07:12.332 --> 07:13.200
Done.

08:16.430 --> 08:17.297
Whoah.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.206
I remember learning in
science class

08:26.240 --> 08:27.741
that it takes 10
muscles to smile

08:29.109 --> 08:30.277
but only six to frown.

08:31.812 --> 08:33.614
Why don't you
take it back?

08:34.548 --> 08:36.216
I can't take it back.

08:36.250 --> 08:37.651
It's never too late.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.522
It's too early maybe.

08:41.555 --> 08:43.357
What do you mean by that?

08:43.390 --> 08:46.393
I mean I probably just
need some time.

08:46.426 --> 08:47.761
I think I'll come around
to him eventually

08:47.794 --> 08:50.230
but right now I have
other things in my mind.

08:50.264 --> 08:51.131
Like what?

08:55.435 --> 08:56.136
Look.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.139
You seem to be
healing physically.

09:00.374 --> 09:01.174
I want you to try something

09:01.208 --> 09:04.411
since you enjoy using
your camera.

09:04.444 --> 09:06.346
I think it would be
healthy for you

09:06.380 --> 09:07.814
to try a video diary.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.385
You know, just five
minutes a day

09:11.418 --> 09:13.720
when it's just you
and your camera.

09:13.754 --> 09:16.423
You can say anything you
want, anything you feel.

09:16.456 --> 09:18.125
A diary?

09:18.158 --> 09:19.726
I know, it sounds silly.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.628
But studies have shown
that it's got

09:21.662 --> 09:23.830
practical benefits for
self-healing.

09:24.798 --> 09:26.199
It's just another way to get

09:26.233 --> 09:28.268
your personal feelings out,
you know,

09:29.136 --> 09:30.370
kind of clear your mind.

09:36.410 --> 09:37.811
Hi everybody, this is
Isaac Cypress

09:37.844 --> 09:39.513
log number 46.

09:39.546 --> 09:41.448
30 more light years to go.

09:41.481 --> 09:42.816
I mean who knows if
we'll find anything

09:42.849 --> 09:44.851
but I'm just really
proud to represent Earth

09:44.885 --> 09:46.720
and humanity out here.

09:46.753 --> 09:49.156
And I never know what
to say in these things.

09:50.457 --> 09:51.725
Like I don't know who
I'm talking to.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.560
If anyone will ever see this.

09:54.561 --> 09:55.495
What's out there.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.165
Mom, I love you.

09:59.499 --> 10:01.268
Darryl, I'm sorry.

10:01.301 --> 10:02.269
You know, six
billion light years

10:02.302 --> 10:04.705
really changes your
perspective about things.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.207
Hey Dad, you know I
was wondering

10:07.240 --> 10:10.177
if we'd break into another
dimension out here.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.545
One where you're still alive.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.850
I was thinking about
what I would say to you

10:16.883 --> 10:18.251
if I ever saw you again.

10:19.286 --> 10:20.654
If you would even
know who I was,

10:20.687 --> 10:23.123
if that version of you
would know who I was.

10:32.399 --> 10:35.202
It's weird not
having you around.

10:39.373 --> 10:41.341
So check it out, I made
it to the top.

10:42.609 --> 10:43.543
Took me like two hours

10:43.577 --> 10:45.579
so I'll probably gonna
hitchhike back down.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.281
Hopefully there's some
cute girls going down

10:48.315 --> 10:49.149
and not any creepers.

10:50.584 --> 10:51.818
So I guess if there's
any pickup trucks

10:51.852 --> 10:53.387
I'll just put my thumb down.

11:20.747 --> 11:22.416
Presentation is
going to be given by...

11:22.449 --> 11:23.750
So we've been making a
lot of progress

11:23.784 --> 11:25.652
on our Millennium II project.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.354
I don't wanna brag but
it's kind of like

11:27.387 --> 11:29.990
the biggest thing since
sliced bread,

11:30.024 --> 11:32.793
if sliced bread could
actually carry humans to Mars,

11:32.826 --> 11:37.831
so I'm so excited about that.

16:31.258 --> 16:33.727
A meteorite with
smoke trailing behind it

16:33.760 --> 16:36.197
appeared over the skies
of Los Angeles yesterday

16:36.230 --> 16:38.765
and California State Professor
Gary Ballmer believes

16:38.798 --> 16:40.201
the origin of the space rock

16:40.234 --> 16:43.670
came from the asteroid belt
between Mars and Jupiter.

16:43.703 --> 16:45.905
No word on the exact
location of impact

16:45.939 --> 16:47.108
as scientist are...

16:47.141 --> 16:48.708
All right guys, all
hands on deck.

16:48.742 --> 16:51.811
We got two days to collect
as many samples as,

16:51.845 --> 16:52.712
where's Isaac?

16:54.714 --> 16:56.250
I don't know, we
haven't seen him all day.

16:58.585 --> 16:59.819
Meteorologists from UCLA

16:59.853 --> 17:02.622
say an occurrence like
this is extremely rare.

21:52.979 --> 21:55.316
You are exhibiting
symptoms of dehydration

21:55.349 --> 21:58.118
so I recommend resting
for a few days

21:58.152 --> 21:59.952
and drinking lots of water.

21:59.986 --> 22:02.356
However, the x-ray of your arms

22:03.324 --> 22:05.892
reveals something very strange.

22:07.161 --> 22:09.563
Your arm appears to
have a fracture.

22:09.596 --> 22:11.998
Perfectly straight, hair thin.

22:13.434 --> 22:17.471
And at an almost perfect right
angle all the way through.

22:20.407 --> 22:24.178
Now this is a normal fracture.

22:24.211 --> 22:26.547
You see, it's imperfect.

22:26.580 --> 22:28.315
Very much unlike yours.

22:28.349 --> 22:31.352
You said you've never
broken your arm before?

22:31.385 --> 22:32.252
No.

22:34.621 --> 22:37.024
It appears as
though your arm was

22:37.057 --> 22:39.926
perfectly cut all the
way through.

22:39.959 --> 22:40.627
Let me see.

22:47.201 --> 22:48.001
Incredible.

22:48.035 --> 22:51.038
Absolutely no sign of
scar tissue.

22:51.071 --> 22:52.206
It's perfectly healed.

22:53.340 --> 22:54.108
Tell you what.

22:55.342 --> 22:58.078
We're going to review
the x-rays a bit more

22:58.112 --> 23:00.180
and give you a call
within the next week.

23:17.331 --> 23:18.532
Hey Beck, are you busy?

23:21.635 --> 23:22.503
Beck?

23:26.240 --> 23:28.175
Whoah, whoah whoah.

23:28.208 --> 23:29.109
Isaac, what's up, man?

23:29.143 --> 23:31.011
Where you been?

23:31.044 --> 23:33.046
Mark was looking all
over for you.

23:33.080 --> 23:34.415
You got a minute?

23:34.448 --> 23:35.915
I wanna show you something.

23:37.551 --> 23:38.419
Sure.

24:22.162 --> 24:23.030
What?

24:27.234 --> 24:28.235
Look, it's gone.

24:29.670 --> 24:31.104
What, the cup?

24:33.173 --> 24:34.241
Yeah, the cup.

24:38.679 --> 24:39.546
This cup?

24:42.483 --> 24:43.383
Are you okay?

24:44.751 --> 24:46.520
You didn't see that?

24:46.553 --> 24:48.021
See what?

24:48.055 --> 24:48.889
You stared at it for
five minutes

24:48.922 --> 24:51.058
and then, I don't know
what that was.

24:51.091 --> 24:52.693
No, I mean it disappeared.

24:52.726 --> 24:53.727
You didn't see that?

24:55.529 --> 24:56.463
Are you serious?

25:04.137 --> 25:05.706
All right.

25:05.739 --> 25:07.508
I have something else I
wanna show you.

25:21.688 --> 25:23.156
What was that?

25:23.190 --> 25:24.691
That was Saturday.

25:24.725 --> 25:26.260
I went for a hike.

25:26.293 --> 25:27.661
You're saying this is real.

25:29.563 --> 25:31.198
You believe me, right?

25:31.231 --> 25:33.133
I mean, that's pretty crazy.

25:34.468 --> 25:37.137
With everything going on
right now, with the meteor.

25:38.338 --> 25:41.141
Where have you been for
the last few days?

25:41.174 --> 25:42.242
Yesterday?

25:42.276 --> 25:44.278
Yeah yesterday,
the day before.

25:44.311 --> 25:45.345
I went for a hike.

25:45.379 --> 25:46.580
No.

25:46.613 --> 25:48.115
That was Saturday.

25:48.148 --> 25:49.683
Dude, it's Wednesday.

25:49.716 --> 25:52.352
You've been gone from
work all week.

25:52.386 --> 25:55.188
I got more information out
of the samples last night.

25:55.889 --> 25:57.324
Oh, hey Isaac.

26:02.262 --> 26:02.829
Okay.

26:04.131 --> 26:06.066
Soil pH level is at a
neutral seven.

26:06.733 --> 26:08.335
So still no signs?

26:08.368 --> 26:10.103
No, not yet.

26:10.137 --> 26:12.639
I mean there's gotta be pieces
of it in the crater somewhere.

26:12.673 --> 26:14.808
It just doesn't make any sense.

26:14.841 --> 26:17.277
No traceable iron
nickel in the soil either.

26:17.311 --> 26:18.745
Unless it had native elements

26:18.779 --> 26:20.247
with more chemical complexity,

26:20.280 --> 26:22.316
there's no evidence
of a meteorite.

26:22.349 --> 26:24.451
There should have been
debris or something else.

26:24.484 --> 26:25.852
I mean the surveillance
footage we have

26:25.886 --> 26:26.820
is not good.

26:27.454 --> 26:29.756
No, debris
would have burned up.

26:29.790 --> 26:30.824
You know the best
footage out there

26:30.857 --> 26:32.459
is actually from
someone's cellphone.

26:32.492 --> 26:33.694
Barelli's footage?

26:33.727 --> 26:36.229
No, someone else
posted it on Science Magazine.

26:36.263 --> 26:37.065
Oh, really?

26:37.097 --> 26:38.165
Yeah, let
me pull it up.

26:38.198 --> 26:39.366
- We should show it to her.
- We can't show it now.

26:39.399 --> 26:42.235
I have been trying to get them
to post our couple photos.

26:42.269 --> 26:44.438
Their site gets millions
of views a day.

26:44.471 --> 26:45.806
Yeah, it's only been a day

26:45.839 --> 26:47.307
and they're already at
a million with this one.

26:47.341 --> 26:48.175
I know.

26:54.214 --> 26:55.515
Where is he going?

26:55.549 --> 26:57.417
I don't know.

27:53.974 --> 27:55.776
Did you get the
link I sent you?

27:55.809 --> 27:56.476
Uh, no.

27:56.510 --> 27:57.944
You should watch the video.

27:57.978 --> 28:00.914
Guy says he got abducted
by aliens, has footage.

28:00.947 --> 28:02.816
Funny but it looks legit.

28:14.728 --> 28:15.362
Hello?

28:15.395 --> 28:17.798
Hi, is this Isaac Cypress?

28:17.831 --> 28:19.232
Yeah this is him.

28:19.266 --> 28:21.868
Hi, this is Christine
Schafer from KFLA.

28:25.572 --> 28:26.473
Hi, Christine.

28:26.506 --> 28:28.909
I saw your video that
you posted online

28:28.942 --> 28:31.012
and I was very intrigued by it.

28:31.045 --> 28:33.747
I was wondering if
you'd be available

28:33.780 --> 28:35.482
to stop by the station in person

28:35.515 --> 28:36.983
so we can do a story about it.

29:25.632 --> 29:26.299
Hello?

29:26.333 --> 29:27.400
Hello, is this Isaac?

29:27.434 --> 29:28.268
Yeah.

29:28.301 --> 29:29.870
Isaac, my name
is Darren Meyers

29:29.903 --> 29:31.371
from an online media blog.

29:31.404 --> 29:33.007
We'd like to do an interview
if you're available.

29:33.040 --> 29:35.408
Oh, sure, yeah. I have to go,
I'm late for work.

29:35.442 --> 29:36.476
Can I call you back later?

29:36.510 --> 29:37.778
Sure, let me
give you my information

29:37.811 --> 29:38.545
to reach me.

29:50.991 --> 29:52.093
Hi, Isaac.

29:52.126 --> 29:54.061
Vince Price here with
the Daily Band.

29:54.095 --> 29:55.062
I saw your video and
wanted to know

29:55.096 --> 29:57.764
if you'd be interested
to run a story, let me...

30:21.488 --> 30:24.357
Okay so when we go
live I'll introduce you

30:24.391 --> 30:25.992
and it'll be just like
we talked about.

30:26.027 --> 30:28.728
Five, five, four three,
two,

30:31.065 --> 30:31.998
Good afternoon.

30:32.033 --> 30:34.701
I'm here with local
resident Isaac Cypress

30:34.734 --> 30:36.503
whose story came to us yesterday

30:36.536 --> 30:39.606
through a viral video of
an actual alien abduction.

30:39.639 --> 30:42.043
Now Isaac claims to
have been abducted

30:42.076 --> 30:44.611
and here is the video
he says is proof

30:44.644 --> 30:45.712
of that incident.

30:57.591 --> 31:01.028
So Isaac, can you tell us
what happened that afternoon?

31:03.030 --> 31:06.633
So I was just
finishing a hike and

31:06.666 --> 31:07.934
I was off the road a ways.

31:07.968 --> 31:10.770
And I heard this noise on
my right side.

31:10.804 --> 31:12.073
I looked over and I
saw something

31:12.106 --> 31:13.540
coming out of the bushes.

31:14.674 --> 31:18.645
And that's when it just
stared at me.

31:18.678 --> 31:20.614
And I just stood there,
I didn't know what to do.

31:20.647 --> 31:21.982
I felt paralyzed.

31:22.016 --> 31:24.985
When it left, I felt like
I was able to move again.

31:25.019 --> 31:27.654
First thing that crossed
my mind was run.

31:27.687 --> 31:31.658
So I ran as fast as I could
in the opposite direction.

31:31.691 --> 31:34.828
And as I was running I
heard this noise,

31:34.861 --> 31:36.863
it was like a machine.

31:36.897 --> 31:39.133
But there wasn't anything there,
and

31:42.103 --> 31:44.138
all of a sudden my body
just instantly jolted.

31:44.171 --> 31:45.906
I felt like I got hit by a car.

31:45.939 --> 31:48.975
And I could tell
something was wrong

31:49.010 --> 31:50.510
but I couldn't move my body

31:50.543 --> 31:52.412
and I started to black out.

31:53.613 --> 31:54.581
And the next thing I remember

31:54.614 --> 31:57.218
I woke up in a completely
different location.

31:57.251 --> 31:58.119
Wow.

31:59.586 --> 32:04.025
So you don't think it's
rather convenient

32:04.058 --> 32:06.459
that you had a camera with you?

32:06.493 --> 32:08.995
You know, that you happened
to catch this on camera?

32:10.630 --> 32:12.799
Well no, I was
documenting myself at first.

32:14.001 --> 32:15.869
Is that really something
that people do?

32:17.104 --> 32:19.839
I mean why, why were you
documenting yourself?

32:26.947 --> 32:28.915
I was starting to do that.

32:28.949 --> 32:30.817
It was therapeutic
and it was sort

32:30.850 --> 32:32.519
of an experiment for me.

32:33.620 --> 32:34.255
That's something that
isn't normal,

32:34.288 --> 32:36.190
I wanted to do that.

32:36.223 --> 32:37.757
It's interesting.

32:37.791 --> 32:41.828
So now you have a bachelor's
degree in mathematics.

32:41.861 --> 32:44.531
And you currently work
as a computer engineer

32:44.564 --> 32:46.733
for JPL, right?

32:46.766 --> 32:51.604
So is it possible that
you created this video

32:51.638 --> 32:52.973
on your computer?

32:56.776 --> 32:58.511
I'm not making this up.

32:58.545 --> 32:59.180
This really happened to me.

32:59.213 --> 33:00.281
This is not fake.

33:00.314 --> 33:01.148
This really happened to me.

33:01.182 --> 33:02.316
Okay.

33:02.350 --> 33:05.219
Well I mean it is, it's
definitely an interesting story.

33:05.252 --> 33:07.687
Thank you Isaac for your time.

33:07.721 --> 33:10.824
Now could this be a
legitimate abduction story

33:10.857 --> 33:12.293
or just another hoax?

33:12.326 --> 33:13.626
We'll let you decide.

33:13.660 --> 33:16.930
Go to our homepage at
KFLA.com/stories

33:16.963 --> 33:18.565
and tell us what you think.

33:19.899 --> 33:21.634
Yup, wrapped, awesome.

33:21.668 --> 33:22.836
Great, thank you so much.

33:24.904 --> 33:25.739
What are we doing next?

33:25.772 --> 33:26.706
Do you have my pages?

33:30.643 --> 33:32.046
So this thing blew
up overnight.

33:32.079 --> 33:34.248
Some guy posted a video claiming

33:34.281 --> 33:36.816
that he's been
abducted by aliens.

33:36.850 --> 33:39.686
Now I personally don't
see any legitimate proof

33:39.719 --> 33:40.987
that this thing is real.

33:41.022 --> 33:42.889
I mean yeah, it could
easily be a fake.

33:42.922 --> 33:45.092
But it's making
headlines for a reason.

33:45.126 --> 33:46.060
It's really well made.

33:46.093 --> 33:48.928
There are a few things
we need to look for.

33:48.962 --> 33:52.233
The biggest proponent is
that it coincides

33:52.266 --> 33:54.734
with the meteor crash that
happened on the same day.

33:54.768 --> 33:57.904
There is simply no
way a normal human being

33:57.937 --> 33:59.639
could mimic this
movement pattern.

33:59.672 --> 34:02.675
In fact we've done several
analytical passes on it.

34:02.709 --> 34:03.543
Oh come on.

34:03.576 --> 34:05.346
In this case, there's
no way to know

34:05.379 --> 34:07.081
and so it's not viable evidence.

34:07.114 --> 34:09.116
This is just a kid
seeking attention

34:09.150 --> 34:10.017
and that's all!

34:10.051 --> 34:12.286
Isaac, can you possibly
tell me anything

34:12.319 --> 34:13.387
that's going on?

34:13.421 --> 34:14.221
Could you describe what
you saw on the spacecraft?

34:14.255 --> 34:15.989
Why did you have a
camera with you?

34:16.023 --> 34:17.791
How does it feel
knowing that people

34:17.824 --> 34:19.093
are saying you're a fake?

34:21.328 --> 34:22.929
Meet the man who
says he helped

34:22.962 --> 34:26.599
Isaac Cypress create the
infamous abduction video.

34:26.633 --> 34:28.968
Yeah, we knew each other
back in college

34:29.003 --> 34:30.904
and there's
different 3D programs

34:30.937 --> 34:33.007
that we learned back then
to make the alien look real.

34:33.040 --> 34:34.308
People have taken to
the attention

34:34.341 --> 34:36.910
of top Hollywood visual
effect supervisors

34:36.943 --> 34:38.711
for their input on the video.

34:38.745 --> 34:40.047
Well it looks very real.

34:40.081 --> 34:43.716
I mean if it is fake, it's
remarkably sophisticated

34:43.750 --> 34:44.818
and very well done.

34:44.851 --> 34:47.221
It's shoddy homemade CGI,
sorry.

34:47.254 --> 34:49.756
You can make something like
that with a cheap laptop.

34:49.789 --> 34:51.292
The rumor looks like
amateurish animation to me.

34:51.325 --> 34:52.659
It looks fake.

36:39.966 --> 36:41.968
Can I get you anything?

36:42.002 --> 36:44.071
Yeah, coffee,
black please.

36:56.083 --> 36:56.950
Sara?

36:59.886 --> 37:00.521
Hey.

37:00.554 --> 37:01.422
Hey.

37:05.992 --> 37:07.127
Can I get
you anything?

37:08.128 --> 37:09.330
I'm okay for right now.

37:11.065 --> 37:12.032
All right.

37:12.066 --> 37:14.268
Let me know if you guys
need anything else.

37:17.937 --> 37:19.006
Thank you for coming.

37:20.207 --> 37:22.376
I know it's really weird
meeting a stranger.

37:25.179 --> 37:27.847
So you said you've had
an encounter, right?

37:29.250 --> 37:30.850
What?

37:30.883 --> 37:33.120
That's what you think
happened with your arm.

37:33.153 --> 37:35.289
I'm not saying anything
like that happened.

37:35.322 --> 37:36.990
Didn't anything
strange happen to you

37:37.024 --> 37:38.092
before you noticed it?

37:39.526 --> 37:40.860
I don't know what
you're talking about.

37:40.893 --> 37:42.129
The thing with your arm.

37:43.097 --> 37:43.863
The same thing I have.

37:45.132 --> 37:47.001
I didn't notice this
until after the,

37:53.207 --> 37:54.074
here.

38:08.289 --> 38:09.156
I saw that.

38:10.124 --> 38:11.158
But that's real?

38:12.992 --> 38:13.826
You really...

38:13.860 --> 38:15.029
It's real.

38:15.462 --> 38:16.996
I know it's hard for
people to believe me.

38:17.031 --> 38:17.964
I don't really blame them.

38:19.266 --> 38:20.933
That's why I reached out to you.

38:25.506 --> 38:27.341
This stuff really happens?

38:31.944 --> 38:33.414
Have you seen these paintings?

38:35.915 --> 38:37.484
This was painted in the
15th century.

38:38.918 --> 38:40.054
I mean you look at some
of these paintings,

38:40.087 --> 38:43.123
these are some of the earliest
accounts ever recorded.

38:43.157 --> 38:46.260
This was painted in
1710 by Eric de Gelder.

38:46.293 --> 38:47.227
Look!

38:47.261 --> 38:49.596
I mean it's like they've
been around forever.

38:49.630 --> 38:51.964
In 1899 Nikola Tesla
built this giant

38:51.998 --> 38:53.567
radio tower in his
home in Colorado

38:53.600 --> 38:57.204
and he got these signals,
this sequence of numbers.

38:57.237 --> 38:59.573
And he was convinced they
were alien communication

38:59.606 --> 39:01.575
thinking that numbers would be

39:01.608 --> 39:03.277
a universal
communicative method.

39:04.411 --> 39:07.314
1927, Norwegian
engineer Jurgen Hawes,

39:07.348 --> 39:09.216
he was doing experiments
with radio signals

39:09.249 --> 39:10.417
and some of the experiments,

39:10.451 --> 39:12.419
the signals were
echoing back to him

39:12.453 --> 39:14.321
seconds after the
transmission ended.

39:15.222 --> 39:17.191
He could never explain why.

39:17.224 --> 39:19.093
On the Apollo 11, 1969,

39:19.126 --> 39:20.627
astronaut Buzz Aldrin
said in secret

39:20.661 --> 39:22.396
that they observed this
object out the window

39:22.429 --> 39:24.465
just hovering right
alongside them.

39:24.498 --> 39:26.600
It was never identified.

39:26.633 --> 39:30.003
1977, city telescope picked
up this unusual signal.

39:30.037 --> 39:32.606
It had the signature of
interstellar transmission.

39:32.639 --> 39:34.141
They couldn't figure
out where it came from

39:34.174 --> 39:34.974
or who sent it.

39:36.076 --> 39:39.246
1998, NASA Space
shuttle The Endeavor,

39:39.279 --> 39:42.116
the astronauts photographed
this black object

39:42.149 --> 39:43.384
right above earth.

39:43.417 --> 39:45.352
I mean, it's all there.

39:51.392 --> 39:53.993
Did you hear about
that abduction in 1979?

39:54.027 --> 39:55.162
No, what happened?

39:56.130 --> 39:57.297
I'll have to find
out the details

39:57.331 --> 39:59.299
but that guy was
abducted in the woods.

39:59.333 --> 40:01.168
I think it was Alaska?

40:02.302 --> 40:03.370
And there were three
witnesses with him

40:03.404 --> 40:05.139
who all passed lie
detector tests.

40:07.574 --> 40:10.043
I think his name is
Carl or Clark.

40:10.077 --> 40:12.613
I can't remember, I'll
have to look it up but,

40:12.646 --> 40:14.348
after he came out
with his story,

40:16.183 --> 40:17.451
he went missing.

40:19.753 --> 40:22.189
I know I have it saved
in my computer somewhere.

40:25.992 --> 40:27.227
This is my phone number.

40:28.128 --> 40:29.730
If you wanna, I don't know,

40:29.763 --> 40:31.998
talk or anything, you know.

40:33.167 --> 40:34.034
Okay.

40:35.068 --> 40:35.935
Cool.

40:38.705 --> 40:39.573
I better go.

40:44.678 --> 40:45.512
Bye.

40:45.546 --> 40:46.413
Bye.

42:12.733 --> 42:13.400
Hello?

42:13.433 --> 42:14.568
Hello, is this Isaac?

42:14.601 --> 42:16.537
Hey, yeah.

42:16.570 --> 42:18.205
Hi, it's Sara.

42:18.238 --> 42:19.640
Oh hey, how are you?

42:20.874 --> 42:21.842
I'm okay.

42:21.875 --> 42:25.112
Hey I found that story
I was telling you about.

42:25.145 --> 42:26.413
The guy's name is Carl Miessner.

42:27.714 --> 42:31.552
Says he was abducted in
1979 in Wrangell, Alaska.

42:31.585 --> 42:33.086
Him and three of his coworkers

42:33.120 --> 42:34.588
were lumbering in
Alaskan wilderness

42:34.621 --> 42:36.223
about 30 minutes from
the nearest town.

42:36.256 --> 42:37.691
What was his name?

42:37.724 --> 42:39.059
Carl Miessner.

42:41.128 --> 42:42.696
On their way back
after a day's work

42:42.729 --> 42:45.465
they encountered a large
hovering disc.

42:45.499 --> 42:47.534
They witnessed a bluish
green light hit Carl

42:47.568 --> 42:49.236
and draw him into the craft.

42:50.437 --> 42:52.406
I don't see anything on him.

42:52.439 --> 42:54.207
Yeah I found a news
article in the library.

42:54.241 --> 42:55.309
I couldn't find anything
online either.

42:55.342 --> 42:56.476
But I scanned the pages.

42:56.510 --> 42:57.644
Can you
send them to me?

42:57.678 --> 42:58.879
Okay.

42:58.912 --> 43:01.415
Isaac Cypress,
the man whose abduction story

43:01.448 --> 43:04.251
has spread internationally
is being debunked a hoax.

43:04.585 --> 43:06.320
Hey send me that
story, I'll check it out.

43:06.353 --> 43:06.753
Okay.

43:06.787 --> 43:07.955
Bye.

43:07.988 --> 43:10.824
Yeah I don't see how anyone
could take this seriously.

43:10.857 --> 43:12.492
I mean I really
honestly don't know

43:12.526 --> 43:14.861
how this guy's gotten
this video out so far.

43:14.895 --> 43:18.265
More and more we're just
seeing the normalization of,

44:40.914 --> 44:42.883
Hey, let me give you a hand.

44:51.558 --> 44:52.392
Thanks, dude.

44:52.426 --> 44:52.926
Yeah, no sweat.

44:54.361 --> 44:56.596
Looks like you put a
lot of work into these.

44:56.630 --> 44:58.498
You got a lot of them.

45:00.701 --> 45:02.502
Hey don't I?

45:02.536 --> 45:04.404
Don't I recognize you
from somewhere?

45:06.673 --> 45:09.010
Yeah, you're that guy
in the news,

45:09.043 --> 45:10.777
the one with the
abduction story.

45:11.978 --> 45:13.847
I thought I recognized you.

45:13.880 --> 45:15.248
Yeah, that's me.

45:15.282 --> 45:15.949
Yeah.

45:16.983 --> 45:17.818
Thanks.

45:17.851 --> 45:19.553
Hey, wait a second.

45:20.787 --> 45:22.556
I know you've been
getting a lot of attention

45:22.589 --> 45:23.390
around your story.

45:23.423 --> 45:24.891
I don't wanna bother you,
I just,

45:24.925 --> 45:25.792
I'm a writer.

45:27.861 --> 45:29.030
I wrote my own online blog.

45:29.063 --> 45:33.467
I'd love to help you get your
story out there, you know?

45:33.500 --> 45:34.868
I mean I've seen how the
press is twisting it.

45:34.901 --> 45:35.902
It's really not fair.

45:37.370 --> 45:39.673
I mean I'd just love to
help, get your side out.

45:41.075 --> 45:43.610
Anyway, yeah just think
about it, no pressure at all.

45:44.845 --> 45:47.014
Oh hey, you know what,
let me give you my card.

45:50.684 --> 45:51.518
Here you go.

45:51.551 --> 45:52.753
Yeah, just think about it.

45:54.387 --> 45:55.622
I'd love to help.

45:55.655 --> 45:58.558
Anyways, have a good day.

45:58.592 --> 45:59.459
Thanks.

46:06.767 --> 46:08.668
I just don't see any
reason to think of it

46:08.702 --> 46:10.604
as a legitimate case.

46:10.637 --> 46:12.839
I don't even know why
this is still a question.

46:15.675 --> 46:16.910
It's way too coincidental

46:16.943 --> 46:18.612
and he doesn't even report
this to anyone,

46:18.645 --> 46:20.647
he just posts the video online?

46:20.680 --> 46:22.382
There's no record of
his disappearance

46:22.415 --> 46:23.884
and that's why I just
don't see any reason

46:23.917 --> 46:25.786
to think of it as a
legitimate case.

47:15.602 --> 47:18.605
All right,
goodbye.

47:19.606 --> 47:20.274
- Hi.
- Hi.

47:20.308 --> 47:21.641
I'm looking for Keith Oberman?

47:21.675 --> 47:23.077
Oberman.

47:23.110 --> 47:23.944
What's your name?

47:23.977 --> 47:26.047
Isaac Cypress.

47:32.786 --> 47:33.653
Hi Keith.

47:34.788 --> 47:37.858
I have an Isaac Cypress
here to see you.

47:38.892 --> 47:39.759
Yeah.

47:40.794 --> 47:41.828
Sure thing.

47:41.862 --> 47:42.929
I'll bring him up now.

47:44.664 --> 47:45.532
Okay.

47:46.833 --> 47:49.136
Mr. Cypress, right this way.

48:00.847 --> 48:01.715
Here you go.

48:02.749 --> 48:03.583
Hey, thank you.

48:03.617 --> 48:05.852
Isaac, good to see you.

48:05.886 --> 48:06.753
Come on in.

48:08.122 --> 48:10.423
I'm really glad you
decided to stop by.

48:10.457 --> 48:11.458
Please, have a seat.

48:16.197 --> 48:18.598
So, man.

48:18.632 --> 48:21.668
The media is going crazy
with this, huh?

48:22.969 --> 48:24.571
I mean do you think after
seeing your tape

48:24.604 --> 48:25.939
they'd ease off a little.

48:25.972 --> 48:26.840
Yeah I guess not.

48:26.873 --> 48:29.743
Right, how much proof
do they want?

48:29.776 --> 48:31.978
You know I was thinking
how to get your story out

48:32.013 --> 48:36.917
and it'd be like solid
and undeniable, right?

48:36.950 --> 48:38.752
This might sound a little crazy

48:38.785 --> 48:39.753
but I was thinking,

48:41.821 --> 48:44.457
have you ever had a lie
detector test?

48:44.491 --> 48:45.458
Lie detector?

48:45.492 --> 48:46.860
Yeah, a lie detector.

48:46.893 --> 48:48.195
A polygraph test.

48:48.229 --> 48:51.531
You see, if you can
pass a lie detector test

48:51.564 --> 48:52.933
and we publish that article,

48:54.534 --> 48:56.137
man you're sitting on
solid ground.

48:58.571 --> 48:59.906
Okay, yeah.

48:59.940 --> 49:01.208
Yeah, you wanna take one?

49:02.243 --> 49:03.077
Here?

49:03.110 --> 49:04.045
Yeah.

49:04.078 --> 49:05.478
You can do that?

49:05.512 --> 49:06.513
Absolutely.

49:06.546 --> 49:07.914
I mean it's pretty
easy actually.

49:07.948 --> 49:09.783
It's small, plugs
right in a laptop.

49:13.020 --> 49:14.554
So what do you think?

49:15.989 --> 49:17.024
Sure.

49:17.058 --> 49:19.093
Great, great.

49:19.126 --> 49:20.961
Okay, I'll be right back,
stay here.

49:33.940 --> 49:35.109
Okay.

49:36.977 --> 49:37.844
Here we go.

49:40.680 --> 49:43.616
So, what we're gonna do

49:45.286 --> 49:47.687
is take the lie detector test

49:47.721 --> 49:50.257
and base our story around that,

49:51.192 --> 49:52.859
giving proof to the article.

49:54.061 --> 49:56.896
And after that point,
it'll be undeniable.

49:56.930 --> 49:59.799
I'd like to see the
big media counter that.

49:59.833 --> 50:02.303
Okay, you're gonna put
these on your fingertips.

50:02.336 --> 50:03.903
One on the index finger.

50:06.040 --> 50:08.742
Yeah, and the other one
on your ring finger.

50:10.244 --> 50:12.612
Now I'm just gonna ask
you a series of questions

50:12.645 --> 50:14.248
and you just answer yes or no.

50:14.948 --> 50:15.815
Okay.

50:15.849 --> 50:17.751
And the first few will
be pretty easy.

50:17.784 --> 50:19.753
I just need to
calibrate the test.

50:19.786 --> 50:20.754
Okay.

50:20.787 --> 50:21.654
Okay.

50:22.655 --> 50:23.590
Well first off,

50:24.624 --> 50:27.094
is your name Isaac Cypress?

50:27.128 --> 50:27.994
Yes.

50:29.596 --> 50:31.065
Is today Friday?

50:31.098 --> 50:31.965
Yes.

50:34.268 --> 50:36.037
Are we in Los
Angeles right now?

50:36.070 --> 50:36.736
Yes.

50:39.373 --> 50:40.673
Do you
intend to answer

50:40.707 --> 50:42.243
these questions truthfully?

50:43.277 --> 50:44.145
Yes.

50:45.712 --> 50:47.981
Have you appeared on
the news recently?

50:48.015 --> 50:48.848
Yes.

50:50.717 --> 50:51.851
Are you human?

50:55.189 --> 50:56.057
Yes.

50:59.126 --> 50:59.993
Good.

51:01.328 --> 51:02.996
Did you ever run away from home?

51:07.801 --> 51:09.170
Yes, when I was little.

51:09.203 --> 51:11.272
It's just a yes
or no question, Isaac.

51:11.305 --> 51:12.173
Yes.

51:14.908 --> 51:17.644
Did you recently
post a video on the internet?

51:17.677 --> 51:18.345
Yes.

51:21.015 --> 51:22.749
Does this
video make false claims

51:22.782 --> 51:24.717
about your disappearance?

51:26.220 --> 51:27.088
No.

51:28.755 --> 51:30.224
Good.

51:30.257 --> 51:32.126
Do you remember where you were

51:32.159 --> 51:35.662
on Wednesday the 6th and
Thursday the 7th of last week?

51:39.799 --> 51:40.667
No.

51:43.337 --> 51:47.108
Did you have an encounter
with an extraterrestrial being?

51:52.879 --> 51:53.746
Yes.

51:59.819 --> 52:00.820
Give me a second.

52:12.832 --> 52:13.833
Sir.

52:13.867 --> 52:14.767
You need to come with us.

52:14.801 --> 52:15.735
- Wait, what?
- Sir!

52:15.768 --> 52:16.936
Let me go.

52:16.970 --> 52:17.837
Let me go.

52:17.871 --> 52:18.805
Get off of me!

52:19.939 --> 52:21.075
Get off of me!

52:38.225 --> 52:41.728
Patient
IO174R to holding block C,

52:41.761 --> 52:43.963
room number 284 ready.

52:43.997 --> 52:44.797
Admission granted.

52:45.899 --> 52:47.434
Regaining
consciousness.

52:47.468 --> 52:50.670
Detecting still humanoid
to alien patient IO174.

52:54.141 --> 52:57.710
Main entrance to
control unit access granted.

52:57.744 --> 53:01.248
Patient T0175 to
holding block C,

53:01.282 --> 53:04.185
room number 285 ready.

53:04.218 --> 53:05.919
Admission granted.

53:05.952 --> 53:09.156
Confirming
patient arrival.

53:24.938 --> 53:26.207
Patient secured.

53:54.401 --> 53:55.402
Hi, Isaac.

53:57.004 --> 53:58.905
My name is Agent Graves.

54:00.507 --> 54:02.176
We have detained you
against your will

54:02.209 --> 54:04.877
because we believe you
have information

54:04.911 --> 54:07.314
that may be valuable to
the future of our society.

54:08.815 --> 54:10.750
You're not the only one
in these circumstances.

54:11.951 --> 54:13.520
There have been many
others in your situation

54:13.554 --> 54:15.522
that we have evaluated.

54:15.556 --> 54:17.258
You have nothing to
be afraid of.

54:19.093 --> 54:21.528
We will need to
perform some tests

54:21.562 --> 54:24.398
in order to determine how
potent your exposure was.

54:25.466 --> 54:27.468
We just ask that you
remain compliant

54:28.901 --> 54:30.870
and this will go
smoothly for everyone.

54:33.407 --> 54:35.276
Run detection for tracker.

54:35.309 --> 54:36.909
Roger.

54:42.483 --> 54:44.351
Internal detection affirmative.

54:44.385 --> 54:45.818
Received.

54:45.852 --> 54:46.986
Set T1.

54:47.021 --> 54:48.422
Roger.

55:05.372 --> 55:07.308
Isaac, I need you to
focus on the scale

55:07.341 --> 55:08.542
in the other room.

55:21.055 --> 55:22.056
Anything?

55:22.089 --> 55:22.955
Not yet.

55:30.564 --> 55:32.099
Done, go T2.

55:39.906 --> 55:41.941
Isaac, I need you to
focus on the water.

55:43.010 --> 55:44.378
Where's Sara?

55:44.411 --> 55:46.979
I need you to
focus on the water right now.

55:49.316 --> 55:50.184
Where are we?

55:51.285 --> 55:53.853
We'll discuss that further
when we are finished.

55:58.025 --> 55:58.891
There you go.

56:12.239 --> 56:17.244
All right.

56:19.346 --> 56:20.214
Dammit.

56:21.115 --> 56:22.249
All right, T3.

56:44.371 --> 56:45.205
What's that?

56:46.039 --> 56:46.973
The needle will hit one

56:47.007 --> 56:49.410
if an outside electrical
current is detected.

56:50.377 --> 56:51.245
It's nothing.

56:54.981 --> 56:56.250
Clear the room.

57:00.254 --> 57:02.122
What do you know about
Carl Miessner?

57:03.390 --> 57:04.558
I have no idea who that is.

57:05.992 --> 57:07.394
We know you're
familiar with Carl.

57:07.428 --> 57:09.696
I need you to tell me
what you know about him.

57:10.564 --> 57:12.099
Where's Sara?

57:12.132 --> 57:14.134
Isaac, I'm
gonna ask you politely.

57:14.168 --> 57:15.002
And you need to cooperate

57:15.035 --> 57:17.504
or this could end very,
very badly.

57:17.538 --> 57:18.405
Where are we?

57:20.107 --> 57:22.109
What are you suggesting?

57:22.142 --> 57:25.279
We wander around British
Columbia aimlessly

57:25.312 --> 57:26.946
until we accidentally find him?

57:33.520 --> 57:34.388
Canada.

57:40.360 --> 57:42.429
Isaac, I'm not gonna
ask you again.

57:43.597 --> 57:45.399
Have you been in
contact with Carl?

57:47.301 --> 57:48.469
Tell me where I am.

57:50.504 --> 57:51.572
Keep an eye on him.

57:59.613 --> 58:02.216
IO174, assistance.

58:06.820 --> 58:09.389
Breach room 284 block C.

58:17.364 --> 58:21.435
Security
breach in block C, room 284.

58:21.468 --> 58:25.138
Repeat, security breach
in block C, room 284.

58:26.340 --> 58:29.176
Engage full security lockdown.

58:30.811 --> 58:31.612
What are you doing?

58:31.645 --> 58:32.312
I don't know.

58:32.346 --> 58:33.580
We're gonna get caught!

58:33.614 --> 58:35.649
Come on.

58:35.682 --> 58:37.050
All
security to block C.

58:37.084 --> 58:38.018
This way.

58:38.051 --> 58:40.020
Breach in
rooms 184 and 185.

58:43.757 --> 58:45.692
IO174, desist.

58:46.860 --> 58:49.096
Security
breach in block C.

58:49.129 --> 58:51.765
Facility on full
security lockdown.

58:56.169 --> 58:58.505
Security breach in block C.

58:58.539 --> 59:01.375
Facility on full
security lockdown.

59:01.408 --> 59:05.612
Go, go, go, go, go!

59:07.114 --> 59:09.216
Facility on
full security lockdown.

59:09.249 --> 59:10.150
What are you doing?

59:10.183 --> 59:11.318
I don't know!

59:11.351 --> 59:12.853
Trying to open your door.

59:15.188 --> 59:17.424
Security
breach in block C.

59:17.457 --> 59:19.593
Facility on full
security lockdown.

59:19.626 --> 59:20.494
Hurry!

59:43.417 --> 59:44.551
Emergency
access request.

59:44.585 --> 59:46.486
Access granted.

59:46.520 --> 59:48.322
Access is
not granted.

59:48.355 --> 59:49.656
Emergency access request.

59:49.690 --> 59:50.357
What happened?

59:50.390 --> 59:51.458
Sir, there's been a breach.

59:51.491 --> 59:55.429
Then why the hell are
you still standing here?!

1:00:25.359 --> 1:00:26.460
I want air and land vehicles

1:00:26.493 --> 1:00:28.161
patrolling the area immediately.

1:00:28.195 --> 1:00:29.763
Both subjects have AT devices.

1:00:29.796 --> 1:00:32.833
I suspect they're on their
way to British Columbia.

1:00:32.866 --> 1:00:35.168
It is imperative that
we track them.

1:00:35.202 --> 1:00:37.404
But more importantly,
we need to follow them.

1:00:38.538 --> 1:00:40.607
We find them, we find Carl.

1:00:41.908 --> 1:00:44.578
All personnel,
report to dispatch.

1:01:12.506 --> 1:01:13.840
Come on, let's try in here.

1:01:14.941 --> 1:01:15.776
I'll see if anybody's

1:01:15.809 --> 1:01:16.843
- here.
- Okay.

1:01:19.579 --> 1:01:20.447
Hello?

1:01:22.916 --> 1:01:24.484
Ola?

1:01:24.518 --> 1:01:25.786
Is anyone there?

1:01:30.757 --> 1:01:32.759
There's nobody there.

1:01:32.793 --> 1:01:34.227
Where are we?

1:01:34.261 --> 1:01:35.295
I think we're in Costa Rica.

1:01:35.328 --> 1:01:36.229
Costa Rica?

1:01:37.931 --> 1:01:39.700
How many days were we gone?

1:01:39.733 --> 1:01:42.269
I don't even know
what day it is.

1:01:42.302 --> 1:01:43.004
Who was Agent Graves?

1:01:43.037 --> 1:01:43.937
Who was that guy?

1:01:45.672 --> 1:01:46.840
We have to talk to Carl.

1:01:46.873 --> 1:01:47.974
How?

1:01:48.009 --> 1:01:48.809
I don't know.

1:01:48.842 --> 1:01:50.243
If I could just get
some internet,

1:01:50.277 --> 1:01:51.378
maybe I can find a way.

1:01:55.649 --> 1:01:56.650
Hello?

1:01:56.683 --> 1:01:57.451
Ola.

1:01:57.484 --> 1:01:58.485
Ola.

1:01:58.518 --> 1:02:01.822
Do you know if there's
internet anywhere nearby?

1:02:01.855 --> 1:02:03.924
Internet, computer?

1:02:14.735 --> 1:02:15.736
That way?

1:02:15.769 --> 1:02:16.903
Uh huh, that way.

1:02:25.545 --> 1:02:26.214
A man named Zed?

1:02:28.849 --> 1:02:29.549
That way?

1:02:29.583 --> 1:02:31.318
Uh huh, that way.

1:03:23.837 --> 1:03:25.072
We're looking for Zed.

1:03:29.776 --> 1:03:30.777
Thank you.

1:03:38.052 --> 1:03:39.352
Zed, right?

1:03:41.022 --> 1:03:41.888
You're Zed?

1:03:43.057 --> 1:03:44.691
We're looking for
information on someone

1:03:44.724 --> 1:03:46.860
and the woman at the last
town gave us your name.

1:03:46.893 --> 1:03:48.361
She said you could help us.

1:03:49.163 --> 1:03:50.931
What's your name?

1:03:50.964 --> 1:03:52.699
My name is Isaac,
this is Sara.

1:03:53.800 --> 1:03:54.901
Your full name.

1:03:56.137 --> 1:03:57.104
Isaac Cypress.

1:03:59.573 --> 1:04:00.941
Look, I need to let
you know up front

1:04:00.974 --> 1:04:03.710
that you need to be 100
percent honest with me.

1:04:03.743 --> 1:04:04.945
If you tell me one wrong thing

1:04:04.978 --> 1:04:06.513
I can't help you.

1:04:06.546 --> 1:04:08.615
So here's a second chance.

1:04:08.648 --> 1:04:09.716
What's your real name?

1:04:11.718 --> 1:04:12.652
I'm being honest with you.

1:04:12.686 --> 1:04:13.987
My real name is Isaac Cypress.

1:04:22.662 --> 1:04:23.797
Okay.

1:04:23.830 --> 1:04:24.698
Have a seat.

1:04:28.035 --> 1:04:30.104
So we're looking for
this guy named Carl.

1:04:32.106 --> 1:04:33.840
Oh no, we have to go.

1:04:33.874 --> 1:04:34.708
What?

1:04:34.741 --> 1:04:35.809
They're outside.

1:04:46.453 --> 1:04:48.989
Caught the attention of
ISRP cops, huh?

1:04:49.023 --> 1:04:50.523
Wait, you know
about those guys?

1:04:50.557 --> 1:04:51.658
Yeah they're part of
the International

1:04:51.691 --> 1:04:53.593
Space Research Program.

1:04:53.627 --> 1:04:55.562
They're an agency that
works for the UN.

1:04:55.595 --> 1:04:57.064
Top secret stuff.
They take residency in

1:04:57.098 --> 1:04:59.966
underground
facilities around here.

1:05:00.001 --> 1:05:01.668
No one knows about them.

1:05:01.701 --> 1:05:02.802
Not your average
civilian anyway.

1:05:04.205 --> 1:05:07.041
You could say I have privileged
access to their network.

1:05:09.243 --> 1:05:11.544
What'd you do to get
on their radar?

1:05:11.578 --> 1:05:13.214
Still trying to
figure that out.

1:05:13.247 --> 1:05:14.148
They kidnapped us.

1:05:15.615 --> 1:05:17.851
That's why I have an
untraceable connection.

1:05:27.194 --> 1:05:28.762
Do you live back here?

1:05:28.795 --> 1:05:29.729
I move around a lot.

1:05:30.797 --> 1:05:33.700
But I've been here for
the last six months or so.

1:05:33.733 --> 1:05:35.769
No place like Costa Rica.

1:06:04.131 --> 1:06:04.998
All right.

1:06:06.033 --> 1:06:06.900
This is it.

1:06:09.070 --> 1:06:09.936
Up there?

1:06:11.038 --> 1:06:11.905
Wow.

1:06:13.673 --> 1:06:14.808
Watch your step.

1:06:33.994 --> 1:06:36.030
Okay his name is Carl.

1:06:36.063 --> 1:06:36.896
What's his last name?

1:06:36.930 --> 1:06:37.764
Meissner.

1:06:37.797 --> 1:06:38.631
Meissner, Carl Meissner.

1:06:38.665 --> 1:06:41.002
Hey, brain man, relax.

1:06:41.035 --> 1:06:42.669
Right, okay.

1:06:42.702 --> 1:06:43.870
No one can trace us here

1:06:43.903 --> 1:06:45.172
so just chill out for a minute

1:06:45.206 --> 1:06:46.207
while I set this up.

1:06:58.252 --> 1:06:59.086
If we weren't fugitives

1:06:59.120 --> 1:07:01.022
this would be a pretty
place to live.

1:07:02.023 --> 1:07:03.957
Wow, yeah.

1:07:03.990 --> 1:07:04.991
It's amazing.

1:07:06.327 --> 1:07:08.728
I knew who you were before
I met you at the cafe.

1:07:11.132 --> 1:07:12.699
I saw your story on the news.

1:07:15.969 --> 1:07:17.138
It was kind of refreshing.

1:07:20.341 --> 1:07:21.975
You never told me your story.

1:07:25.745 --> 1:07:27.981
I don't really talk to
anyone about that anymore.

1:07:32.086 --> 1:07:33.354
It has to do with my
aunt and uncle

1:07:33.387 --> 1:07:34.921
and their cabin in the mountain.

1:07:36.057 --> 1:07:37.324
They went to friends
in the evening

1:07:37.358 --> 1:07:39.160
so I was in the cabin by myself.

1:07:42.029 --> 1:07:42.962
I was tired,

1:07:44.298 --> 1:07:45.732
lying down about to take a nap

1:07:45.765 --> 1:07:48.768
when I heard this noise outside.

1:07:50.404 --> 1:07:52.173
I thought it was a truck
pulling up at first

1:07:52.206 --> 1:07:53.907
so I went to go check it out but

1:07:55.376 --> 1:07:56.876
the sound went away and,

1:07:59.246 --> 1:08:01.648
out of the window I saw
something in the sky.

1:08:03.650 --> 1:08:05.885
It looked like an airplane
that wasn't moving.

1:08:07.088 --> 1:08:08.389
I didn't know what it was

1:08:08.422 --> 1:08:10.790
and I didn't really make
too much of it

1:08:10.824 --> 1:08:13.160
so I went back and fell asleep.

1:08:15.795 --> 1:08:17.897
When I woke up it was two
in the morning

1:08:17.931 --> 1:08:19.999
and I thought I, you know,
just slept late

1:08:20.034 --> 1:08:22.369
but I felt so weird.

1:08:23.370 --> 1:08:24.338
I felt strange.

1:08:26.140 --> 1:08:27.274
I didn't feel the same.

1:08:33.013 --> 1:08:36.283
And when I saw my aunt and
my uncle the next morning

1:08:36.317 --> 1:08:37.284
they were panicked.

1:08:39.919 --> 1:08:41.355
They said I'd been
missing for two days

1:08:42.789 --> 1:08:44.158
and that there were
search and rescue teams

1:08:44.191 --> 1:08:45.392
out there looking for me.

1:08:50.264 --> 1:08:53.267
I have no memory of
what happened, but

1:08:53.300 --> 1:08:55.835
I remember seeing that
strange object in the sky.

1:08:58.339 --> 1:08:59.906
But when I researched it

1:08:59.939 --> 1:09:02.775
I actually did find people
who had similar experiences.

1:09:04.378 --> 1:09:05.179
But then when I told people

1:09:05.212 --> 1:09:07.314
they immediately
thought I was crazy.

1:09:08.848 --> 1:09:09.916
I know that feeling.

1:09:11.218 --> 1:09:12.886
What made you post your video?

1:09:13.887 --> 1:09:15.422
I figured if I posted it

1:09:15.456 --> 1:09:16.123
more people would see it

1:09:16.157 --> 1:09:17.358
and someone would believe me.

1:09:18.858 --> 1:09:21.028
I guess that plan
backfired though.

1:09:21.061 --> 1:09:22.296
Yeah.

1:09:22.329 --> 1:09:24.165
People said the same
thing about me.

1:09:25.199 --> 1:09:26.100
They said I just ran away

1:09:26.133 --> 1:09:28.068
and was looking for attention.

1:09:28.102 --> 1:09:31.405
Yeah we'd make up crazy
alien stories to get attention.

1:09:31.438 --> 1:09:34.108
Yeah, 'cause that's the
kind of attention we want.

1:09:42.082 --> 1:09:43.050
Hey, how's it going?

1:09:43.083 --> 1:09:45.785
No records on this guy
for the last 30 years.

1:09:45.818 --> 1:09:46.953
He knows how to stay
off the grid.

1:09:46.986 --> 1:09:48.022
You looking for the right guy?

1:09:48.055 --> 1:09:49.323
Yeah I think I got it.

1:09:49.356 --> 1:09:50.491
Sure you spelled
his name right?

1:09:50.524 --> 1:09:52.426
Claims to have been
abducted by a UFO?

1:09:52.459 --> 1:09:53.360
That's him.

1:09:53.394 --> 1:09:54.628
What else did you find?

1:09:54.662 --> 1:09:57.097
Well I know you work for NASA,
you live at 3413 Bettinger Way,

1:09:57.131 --> 1:09:59.099
you recently totaled a '97 Volvo

1:09:59.133 --> 1:10:00.800
and you like to collect
puppy dog statues.

1:10:00.833 --> 1:10:01.502
What, no I don't.

1:10:01.535 --> 1:10:03.836
I don't, no, I don't do that.

1:10:03.870 --> 1:10:04.737
When they were questioning me

1:10:04.771 --> 1:10:06.307
they said something about
British Columbia

1:10:06.340 --> 1:10:08.108
when they were
talking about Carl.

1:10:10.544 --> 1:10:13.080
Did that article ever say
anything about Canada?

1:10:14.081 --> 1:10:15.349
No I don't think so.

1:10:15.382 --> 1:10:17.251
It just said Alaska where
he was abducted.

1:10:18.185 --> 1:10:19.119
And you checked everything,

1:10:19.153 --> 1:10:20.787
phone data, postal records,
registration?

1:10:20.820 --> 1:10:21.488
Everything.

1:10:28.028 --> 1:10:28.895
Wait.

1:10:31.098 --> 1:10:33.100
Pull up the Xavier
satellite JPL.

1:10:33.133 --> 1:10:33.967
Why?

1:10:34.001 --> 1:10:34.867
Just do it.

1:10:42.343 --> 1:10:43.310
What does that mean?

1:10:43.344 --> 1:10:44.211
Hang on.

1:10:46.547 --> 1:10:47.414
There, stop.

1:11:00.327 --> 1:11:01.995
There.

1:11:02.029 --> 1:11:02.895
That's it.

1:11:04.031 --> 1:11:05.299
Use those GPS coordinates.

1:11:20.581 --> 1:11:21.448
That it?

1:11:24.051 --> 1:11:25.185
British Columbia, Canada.

1:11:26.020 --> 1:11:26.853
Middle of nowhere though,

1:11:26.886 --> 1:11:29.256
like 60 miles from the
nearest town.

1:11:30.391 --> 1:11:32.159
That's where the
coordinates are pointing.

1:11:32.192 --> 1:11:34.361
The wifi signal is
pretty strong.

1:11:37.331 --> 1:11:38.165
Can I talk to him?

1:11:38.198 --> 1:11:40.034
Yeah I can try and set
up a video chat.

1:11:40.067 --> 1:11:40.933
Gimme a sec.

1:11:51.345 --> 1:11:53.946
All right, it's going through.

1:12:13.367 --> 1:12:14.301
Carl?

1:12:14.335 --> 1:12:15.202
Carl Meissner?

1:12:16.570 --> 1:12:17.571
What happened?

1:12:17.604 --> 1:12:18.971
He logged out.

1:12:19.006 --> 1:12:20.374
That was him.

1:12:20.407 --> 1:12:21.408
Can you get back in?

1:12:21.442 --> 1:12:22.409
If his computer's still on

1:12:22.443 --> 1:12:24.078
I can try to force us in, but

1:12:24.111 --> 1:12:25.878
we may only get one more shot.

1:12:25.912 --> 1:12:27.414
If he shuts down, we're screwed.

1:12:27.448 --> 1:12:28.582
Okay.

1:12:28.615 --> 1:12:29.483
Do it.

1:12:40.127 --> 1:12:41.428
Carl, my name is
Isaac Cypress.

1:12:41.462 --> 1:12:43.030
I'm contacting you
because seven days ago

1:12:43.063 --> 1:12:43.930
I was abducted.

1:12:43.963 --> 1:12:46.166
When my story got out, no
one believed me.

1:12:46.200 --> 1:12:47.468
I was taken against my will

1:12:47.501 --> 1:12:49.069
by some very secret
people who worked

1:12:49.103 --> 1:12:50.404
for a very secret agency.

1:12:50.437 --> 1:12:51.904
They say they know who you are.

1:12:51.938 --> 1:12:52.905
I'm not sure what they want

1:12:52.939 --> 1:12:54.608
but I think that they
still might be after me.

1:12:54.641 --> 1:12:55.676
At this point, you
are my only hope

1:12:55.709 --> 1:12:57.578
in making any sense of
what's going on right now.

1:12:57.611 --> 1:12:59.246
I work for the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory

1:12:59.279 --> 1:13:00.247
in Pasadena California.

1:13:00.280 --> 1:13:02.316
A few months back, we
received audio signals

1:13:02.349 --> 1:13:03.150
on one of our satellites

1:13:03.183 --> 1:13:05.152
from this remote
location in Canada.

1:13:05.185 --> 1:13:06.320
That's how I found you.

1:13:06.353 --> 1:13:08.021
I intercepted your frequency

1:13:08.055 --> 1:13:09.456
and sent it from one of
our satellites

1:13:09.490 --> 1:13:10.624
not knowing what it was.

1:13:10.657 --> 1:13:12.593
That same night I got
a signal back.

1:13:12.626 --> 1:13:14.161
I think that might be why
I was abducted.

1:13:14.194 --> 1:13:15.229
Stop.

1:13:15.262 --> 1:13:16.996
What are you saying?

1:13:17.030 --> 1:13:19.099
You got a signal back?

1:13:19.133 --> 1:13:19.966
Yes.

1:13:21.168 --> 1:13:23.437
You need to send me that
data right now.

1:13:23.470 --> 1:13:24.438
Okay.

1:13:24.471 --> 1:13:27.040
We can try to download
it and send it to you.

1:13:27.074 --> 1:13:28.941
We'll be back online shortly.

1:13:28.975 --> 1:13:30.144
Can you get back into
the NASA server?

1:13:30.177 --> 1:13:31.044
Mhmm.

1:13:34.381 --> 1:13:34.815
That one?

1:13:34.848 --> 1:13:35.516
Yeah.

1:13:35.549 --> 1:13:36.517
Why does he want that data?

1:13:36.550 --> 1:13:39.553
Well, at first I was
thinking it was a glitch

1:13:39.586 --> 1:13:40.721
or a error in the satellite,

1:13:40.754 --> 1:13:42.723
like a non-read error.

1:13:42.756 --> 1:13:45.225
But something tells me it
might be more than that.

1:13:46.260 --> 1:13:47.628
Like what?

1:13:47.661 --> 1:13:48.662
Like them.

1:13:54.334 --> 1:13:56.203
Hey it looks like the
download finished.

1:13:56.236 --> 1:13:58.005
All right.

1:13:58.038 --> 1:13:59.139
Ready to patch back in?

1:14:04.578 --> 1:14:07.181
Hi Carl, we
downloaded the signal.

1:14:07.214 --> 1:14:08.081
Can you send it?

1:14:12.186 --> 1:14:13.253
Okay we just sent it.

1:14:43.183 --> 1:14:44.651
What is he doing?

1:15:00.100 --> 1:15:03.604
We are coming,
Thursday, October 21st,

1:15:03.637 --> 1:15:07.774
four a.m., 48.454709
degrees latitude.

1:15:09.109 --> 1:15:14.114
Negative 123.780212
degrees longitude.

1:15:19.686 --> 1:15:20.687
It worked.

1:15:21.822 --> 1:15:23.490
They're coming here.

1:15:23.524 --> 1:15:24.658
That's in five days.

1:15:28.161 --> 1:15:29.530
I suggest you lay low.

1:15:29.563 --> 1:15:31.632
The agency's not gonna
stop until they find you.

1:15:31.665 --> 1:15:32.833
Get rid of your cellphones,
electronics,

1:15:32.866 --> 1:15:35.168
talk to no one, just
stay off the grid.

1:15:35.202 --> 1:15:37.070
I got to go now, good luck.

1:15:37.104 --> 1:15:38.071
Wait, Carl.

1:15:38.105 --> 1:15:38.705
He logged out again.

1:15:38.739 --> 1:15:39.773
We have to get back in.

1:15:39.806 --> 1:15:40.807
Can you get back in?

1:15:44.811 --> 1:15:46.813
Nope, he shut down, it's over.

1:15:47.748 --> 1:15:49.283
Well that's weird, now what?

1:15:49.316 --> 1:15:51.652
We need to go to Canada
and find Carl.

1:15:51.685 --> 1:15:53.287
We have to be there
when they come.

1:15:53.320 --> 1:15:54.421
What?

1:15:54.454 --> 1:15:57.124
We know where he is and
they're coming in five days,

1:15:57.157 --> 1:15:58.091
we have to go.

1:15:58.125 --> 1:15:59.526
No.

1:15:59.560 --> 1:16:02.129
That's a bad idea,
that's way too dangerous.

1:16:02.162 --> 1:16:04.164
He's the only one
that can help us.

1:16:04.197 --> 1:16:05.232
And if what just
happened is real

1:16:05.265 --> 1:16:07.334
do we really have
another choice?

1:16:07.367 --> 1:16:08.635
I remember
what it was like

1:16:08.669 --> 1:16:09.703
and I'm not going
through that again.

1:16:09.736 --> 1:16:11.271
Please, Sara.

1:16:11.305 --> 1:16:13.173
This has been gnawing at
me night and day.

1:16:13.206 --> 1:16:14.008
I can't eat, I can't sleep,

1:16:14.042 --> 1:16:16.209
I can't think about
anything else.

1:16:16.243 --> 1:16:18.579
I can only imagine what
you've been through.

1:16:18.612 --> 1:16:19.713
I can't stop.

1:16:19.746 --> 1:16:21.615
I have way too many questions.

1:16:21.648 --> 1:16:23.150
And the thing that
terrified me the most,

1:16:23.183 --> 1:16:24.551
this thought I keep dwelling on,

1:16:24.585 --> 1:16:27.421
that I may never be able
to move on from this.

1:16:27.454 --> 1:16:28.322
So I have to go.

1:16:29.890 --> 1:16:31.124
But I need your help.

1:16:32.392 --> 1:16:33.260
Please, come.

1:16:37.631 --> 1:16:38.498
Okay.

1:16:39.933 --> 1:16:40.801
Can I come?

1:17:27.414 --> 1:17:29.716
All right, when we get
there, let me do the talking.

1:17:29.750 --> 1:17:30.751
He'll be cool with you guys,

1:17:30.784 --> 1:17:31.918
he owes me a favor.

1:17:31.952 --> 1:17:36.356
But trust me, the less you
know about him, the better.

1:17:43.497 --> 1:17:46.767
And he's looking right at us,
so move.

1:17:48.835 --> 1:17:50.704
Okay we're good to go.

1:17:54.641 --> 1:17:56.410
Hang on to your seatbelts.

1:17:56.443 --> 1:17:58.879
These things are kind of rough.

1:17:58.912 --> 1:18:00.580
And Jose here's a student.

1:18:00.614 --> 1:18:02.215
Pilot in training.

1:18:06.020 --> 1:18:07.354
Next stop, BC!

1:18:42.456 --> 1:18:43.990
Over the Pacific,
they got out.

1:18:45.358 --> 1:18:46.526
They're going to Canada.

1:18:50.797 --> 1:18:51.898
I need all northern units

1:18:51.932 --> 1:18:55.802
out in search of
EO175 and IO174.

1:18:55.836 --> 1:18:57.671
They're headed into
District Territory

1:18:57.704 --> 1:18:59.673
including all agents
and androids.

1:18:59.706 --> 1:19:03.010
We also have a trail on
primary subject IO35.

1:19:03.044 --> 1:19:04.511
Please standby, over.

1:19:32.639 --> 1:19:33.940
Find anything?

1:19:33.974 --> 1:19:35.342
Yeah, it looks like
there's a train

1:19:35.375 --> 1:19:36.943
that leads into his
nearest town.

1:19:36.977 --> 1:19:38.311
It's 30 miles from his cabin

1:19:38.345 --> 1:19:39.813
but it's the closest we can get.

1:19:40.947 --> 1:19:42.582
Let's do it.

1:19:47.554 --> 1:19:49.656
Yeah it feels like it's fine.

1:19:49.689 --> 1:19:51.358
I can make a fist and
it feels fine.

1:19:51.391 --> 1:19:52.093
It's just when I twist it...

1:19:52.126 --> 1:19:52.959
Twist your wrist?

1:19:52.993 --> 1:19:53.860
Yeah.

1:20:02.969 --> 1:20:04.871
Where did you get that ring?

1:20:04.905 --> 1:20:05.772
Oh.

1:20:06.673 --> 1:20:07.808
My uncle got it for me.

1:20:09.043 --> 1:20:10.077
It stands for love.

1:20:11.045 --> 1:20:12.646
He wanted me to remember that

1:20:13.747 --> 1:20:15.049
no matter the
circumstances I was in

1:20:15.082 --> 1:20:17.051
that I was always loved.

1:20:19.086 --> 1:20:20.587
It's a good reminder.

1:20:20.620 --> 1:20:21.588
Sometimes I forget.

1:20:34.868 --> 1:20:37.904
No but you can't launch
a rocket from out there.

1:20:37.938 --> 1:20:38.972
It takes years.

1:20:39.006 --> 1:20:40.941
So you're literally
a rocket scientist.

1:20:40.974 --> 1:20:41.942
Well
actually satellites

1:20:41.975 --> 1:20:43.810
are what's really tricky to do.

1:20:43.844 --> 1:20:44.978
You're such a dork.

1:20:45.946 --> 1:20:48.015
Whatever man, I'm not.

1:20:48.049 --> 1:20:49.983
Computer engineering,
it takes a lot of focus,

1:20:50.017 --> 1:20:51.751
precise calculation and
you have to be

1:20:51.785 --> 1:20:53.120
really good at math and it's,

1:20:54.988 --> 1:20:56.523
yeah maybe it's a little dorky.

1:20:56.556 --> 1:20:57.191
Yeah.

1:20:57.225 --> 1:20:58.525
But barely though.

1:21:00.894 --> 1:21:01.862
Dammit.

1:21:01.895 --> 1:21:02.729
What?

1:21:02.762 --> 1:21:04.131
They're following us.

1:21:04.165 --> 1:21:05.498
What?

1:21:05.532 --> 1:21:07.934
ISRP cops, they're
tracking us.

1:21:24.451 --> 1:21:26.786
Trackers located.

1:21:29.190 --> 1:21:30.057
Here, put these on!

1:21:30.091 --> 1:21:30.757
What?

1:21:30.790 --> 1:21:31.591
The androids are programmed

1:21:31.625 --> 1:21:33.927
to use facial
recognition for IDs.

1:21:33.960 --> 1:21:35.829
The masks will confuse
their cameras.

1:22:31.285 --> 1:22:33.120
I don't think
this is working!

1:22:33.154 --> 1:22:34.821
Don't move.

1:22:46.167 --> 1:22:47.567
Go, go, go, go!

1:22:50.137 --> 1:22:52.173
Come on, we have to climb!

1:22:54.008 --> 1:22:55.909
Subject
IDs not found.

1:22:55.942 --> 1:22:59.779
Pursue all
tracking devices.

1:23:03.217 --> 1:23:05.119
Trackers located.

1:23:05.152 --> 1:23:07.221
Subjects on roof.

1:23:07.254 --> 1:23:08.521
Come on, keep running!

1:23:08.555 --> 1:23:09.622
Don't stop!

1:23:09.656 --> 1:23:12.259
I4
pursuing subjects.

1:23:13.727 --> 1:23:15.595
Come on, we have
to jump a car.

1:23:15.628 --> 1:23:16.496
There!

1:23:17.797 --> 1:23:20.267
Bot unit I4 down.

1:23:20.301 --> 1:23:22.003
Continue
pursuing tracking devices.

1:23:22.036 --> 1:23:22.669
Come on!

1:23:22.702 --> 1:23:23.837
All right, let's go!

1:23:23.870 --> 1:23:26.207
Trackers located.

1:23:28.641 --> 1:23:29.509
Hey.

1:23:36.850 --> 1:23:39.086
Didn't see that coming.

1:25:14.148 --> 1:25:15.015
Thanks.

1:25:36.836 --> 1:25:37.971
There it is.

1:26:15.176 --> 1:26:16.010
Who are you?

1:26:16.043 --> 1:26:18.778
Carl, Carl, it's Isaac!

1:26:18.811 --> 1:26:20.047
From the video chat.

1:26:20.080 --> 1:26:22.715
I'm the one that gave
you the signal.

1:26:22.749 --> 1:26:23.417
Who are they?

1:26:24.285 --> 1:26:25.119
This is Sara.

1:26:25.152 --> 1:26:26.487
She was abducted too.

1:26:26.520 --> 1:26:28.755
And that's Zed, he helped
us contact you.

1:26:29.490 --> 1:26:31.292
Have you been deactivated?

1:26:31.325 --> 1:26:33.027
What do you mean?

1:26:33.060 --> 1:26:34.228
Is anybody
following you?

1:26:34.261 --> 1:26:35.862
No it's just us.

1:26:44.338 --> 1:26:45.339
Hey, what's the matter?

1:26:46.307 --> 1:26:47.807
Wait, what are you doing?

1:26:47.840 --> 1:26:48.841
Wait, what is that?

1:26:48.875 --> 1:26:49.510
Who else?

1:26:49.543 --> 1:26:50.511
- Move!
- What is that?

1:26:50.544 --> 1:26:51.412
You?

1:26:59.386 --> 1:27:00.853
They're offline.

1:27:00.887 --> 1:27:03.123
Someone deactivated them.

1:27:03.157 --> 1:27:04.124
Tracking devices.

1:27:05.025 --> 1:27:06.493
It's what's in your arms.

1:27:06.527 --> 1:27:07.927
It's not the agents'.

1:27:08.828 --> 1:27:09.496
Them.

1:27:17.338 --> 1:27:18.938
You guys are early.

1:27:18.972 --> 1:27:20.307
They arrive in two days.

1:27:30.251 --> 1:27:33.420
After I got out of the
hands of the ISRP

1:27:33.454 --> 1:27:35.855
I needed to find a way
to make contact.

1:27:37.057 --> 1:27:39.293
I knew that there were
research facilities

1:27:39.326 --> 1:27:41.195
trying to do what I wanted to do

1:27:41.228 --> 1:27:43.430
so I bought up some of
their equipment.

1:27:43.464 --> 1:27:47.034
I've been accumulating
this stuff for 20 years.

1:27:48.269 --> 1:27:50.337
Some of my early tests

1:27:51.538 --> 1:27:54.841
was able to pick up
signals, strange noises.

1:27:56.110 --> 1:27:57.211
Stuff you don't hear.

1:27:59.113 --> 1:28:00.414
What I got back was rare.

1:28:02.082 --> 1:28:03.816
Throughout the years
I was able to

1:28:05.052 --> 1:28:10.057
discover a way to decode
the signals to audio.

1:28:10.090 --> 1:28:12.559
And audio to language.

1:28:18.565 --> 1:28:20.234
Here's some of what I picked up.

1:28:40.487 --> 1:28:42.855
And this is what that
translates to.

1:28:46.160 --> 1:28:48.195
Approaching
solar system.

1:28:51.065 --> 1:28:51.998
Orbiting Earth.

1:28:56.603 --> 1:28:58.905
Human origin positive.

1:29:00.441 --> 1:29:01.241
Returning.

1:29:03.344 --> 1:29:05.279
This is just some
of what I have.

1:29:05.312 --> 1:29:07.047
There's more that
I'm working on.

1:29:08.315 --> 1:29:10.150
But the signal that
you sent back,

1:29:12.553 --> 1:29:15.022
that's the most
descriptive I have.

1:29:15.055 --> 1:29:16.523
It's the only response
I've ever received.

1:29:17.957 --> 1:29:20.060
I've been trying to
contact them for years.

1:29:22.129 --> 1:29:24.064
So if you were able to get

1:29:24.098 --> 1:29:26.367
a direct audio signal from them,

1:29:26.400 --> 1:29:28.035
like if you made contact again

1:29:28.068 --> 1:29:29.036
you could potentially,

1:29:29.069 --> 1:29:29.737
Yeah.

1:29:29.770 --> 1:29:31.305
You could talk to aliens, man!

1:29:32.239 --> 1:29:33.307
Yeah.

1:29:33.340 --> 1:29:36.176
So if you don't
mind me asking,

1:29:37.177 --> 1:29:38.679
how did it happen?

1:29:38.712 --> 1:29:39.546
I mean how did it...

1:29:39.580 --> 1:29:41.081
How was I abducted?

1:29:45.252 --> 1:29:46.953
Boy, it's been a while.

1:29:50.391 --> 1:29:51.525
It was a Thursday.

1:29:53.093 --> 1:29:56.096
1979, November 7th.

1:29:58.132 --> 1:29:59.233
Sun started going down.

1:30:01.101 --> 1:30:05.038
In the Alaskan backwoods,
that's where we were working.

1:30:05.072 --> 1:30:06.039
The day was finished,

1:30:06.073 --> 1:30:07.474
we packed up the timber lorry

1:30:07.508 --> 1:30:10.477
to head back into town.

1:30:13.414 --> 1:30:15.449
Three of my colleagues,
the Haskell brothers,

1:30:15.482 --> 1:30:18.252
they went ahead of me
in their truck.

1:30:18.285 --> 1:30:21.522
And I got in mine to
follow them.

1:30:21.555 --> 1:30:24.358
A bright blue light came down

1:30:24.391 --> 1:30:26.693
and hit the brothers'
truck right in front of me

1:30:26.727 --> 1:30:29.062
and I slammed on the brakes.

1:30:29.096 --> 1:30:30.731
Tried to start my truck,
it wouldn't turn over,

1:30:30.764 --> 1:30:32.166
I ran into the forest.

1:30:32.199 --> 1:30:33.700
I wasn't fast enough.

1:30:33.734 --> 1:30:34.601
It hit me.

1:30:36.236 --> 1:30:37.571
Hit me like a freight train.

1:30:38.639 --> 1:30:40.474
My whole body went stiff.

1:30:42.676 --> 1:30:43.976
I was paralyzed.

1:30:45.179 --> 1:30:47.681
I tried kicking, I
tried resisting.

1:30:49.082 --> 1:30:50.083
But I couldn't move.

1:30:52.419 --> 1:30:56.623
My body went numb, weightless.

1:30:58.125 --> 1:31:00.294
Like I was connected to the air.

1:31:06.500 --> 1:31:08.368
That's the
last thing I remember.

1:31:27.421 --> 1:31:28.522
What was that noise?

1:31:29.756 --> 1:31:31.024
Sounds like thunder.

1:31:38.732 --> 1:31:40.200
Does this work?

1:31:40.234 --> 1:31:40.734
It does.

1:31:41.869 --> 1:31:44.571
You know that was Franklin
Roosevelt's old turntable.

1:31:46.306 --> 1:31:47.174
Wow.

1:32:02.389 --> 1:32:03.557
Can I?

1:32:03.590 --> 1:32:05.259
Of course.

1:33:31.745 --> 1:33:34.848
Upload the coordinates
to facility control.

1:33:39.353 --> 1:33:41.855
This is Agent Graves with
the facility override.

1:33:41.888 --> 1:33:44.591
I need a dispatch on
all bounty units.

1:33:44.625 --> 1:33:47.728
Warrant on subject
I035 reactivated.

1:33:47.761 --> 1:33:50.797
Coordinates are being
transferred to facility control.

1:33:50.831 --> 1:33:55.402
We rendezvous at the location
at 1600 hours Thursday.

1:33:55.435 --> 1:33:56.637
All forces necessary.

1:34:12.819 --> 1:34:14.588
Interested in something?

1:34:14.621 --> 1:34:17.724
You've got an Avalon VT737SP.

1:34:18.859 --> 1:34:20.460
David Bowie used one of these.

1:34:23.797 --> 1:34:26.433
How were you able to
decrypt the radio signals?

1:34:26.466 --> 1:34:28.535
Short wave radio
scanners or what?

1:34:28.568 --> 1:34:31.838
USRP device,
decrypts language.

1:34:31.872 --> 1:34:35.208
But it's open source so the
possibilities are endless.

1:34:36.309 --> 1:34:38.912
Runs off receivers,
transmitters.

1:34:40.247 --> 1:34:42.282
It's all daisy chained to him,

1:34:42.315 --> 1:34:43.850
the only way to pick up
long distance.

1:34:43.884 --> 1:34:47.354
Low rate, complex
baseband signals.

1:34:49.456 --> 1:34:50.590
And you figured out all
this yourself?

1:34:50.624 --> 1:34:51.625
Just about.

1:34:53.593 --> 1:34:55.462
Weren't you a lumberjack?

1:34:55.495 --> 1:34:56.563
That's right.

1:34:57.664 --> 1:34:59.266
Like Paul Bunyan?

1:35:00.534 --> 1:35:01.401
Right.

1:35:02.402 --> 1:35:03.737
Wow.

1:35:05.372 --> 1:35:06.973
You know what they say.

1:35:07.008 --> 1:35:09.643
Necessity is the mother
of invention.

1:35:11.812 --> 1:35:12.913
Can I pull that lever?

1:35:12.946 --> 1:35:13.780
No.

1:35:13.814 --> 1:35:14.681
Okay.

1:35:28.995 --> 1:35:30.464
Are you feeling nervous?

1:35:33.366 --> 1:35:34.601
No, not really.

1:35:35.569 --> 1:35:36.503
I've been nervous.

1:35:37.771 --> 1:35:38.972
It always gets worse the
closer you get

1:35:39.006 --> 1:35:40.007
to the thing you're
nervous about

1:35:40.041 --> 1:35:42.809
but I don't feel it about
this for some reason.

1:35:46.546 --> 1:35:47.581
I mean we got away, right?

1:35:52.953 --> 1:35:55.322
Do you remember what
happened back at the facility?

1:35:57.758 --> 1:35:59.359
How you got me out of my room?

1:36:01.461 --> 1:36:03.697
Or how you opened that
door that we left through?

1:36:07.434 --> 1:36:09.970
It's like something changed us.

1:36:12.439 --> 1:36:13.774
I felt different ever since.

1:36:18.545 --> 1:36:20.014
Do you think that
they were right?

1:36:21.915 --> 1:36:22.816
The agents?

1:36:25.652 --> 1:36:26.820
Do you think that we
were exposed

1:36:26.853 --> 1:36:28.855
to something that could
have changed us?

1:36:29.923 --> 1:36:33.426
I don't know.

1:36:33.460 --> 1:36:34.327
Maybe.

1:36:36.063 --> 1:36:37.597
I've felt it too.

1:36:39.800 --> 1:36:41.501
I know something's different.

1:36:44.071 --> 1:36:45.739
Something is different for sure.

1:36:48.909 --> 1:36:50.510
And then when Carl describes

1:36:52.113 --> 1:36:53.580
you know, time slowing down

1:36:55.149 --> 1:36:57.417
or this feeling of us all
being connected,

1:36:59.920 --> 1:37:01.822
like I seriously felt that

1:37:01.855 --> 1:37:03.590
there was something
wrong with me.

1:37:06.160 --> 1:37:07.427
Like who could I tell?

1:37:09.130 --> 1:37:09.996
I know.

1:37:12.999 --> 1:37:15.602
Well maybe they'll
have answers.

1:37:28.815 --> 1:37:30.483
Give it to me here!

1:37:33.653 --> 1:37:34.988
That was nothing!

1:37:36.990 --> 1:37:38.792
I understand.

1:38:27.574 --> 1:38:29.943
I want you to be ready for
whatever happens tomorrow.

1:38:29.976 --> 1:38:30.810
It could go either way.

1:38:30.844 --> 1:38:33.747
There's no guarantee for
anyone's safety.

1:38:33.780 --> 1:38:34.648
I know.

1:38:37.884 --> 1:38:39.986
That's why we need
to be on the same page.

1:38:40.021 --> 1:38:41.888
When they come, we
get one chance.

1:38:43.124 --> 1:38:45.625
That's why I need to
talk to you about a plan.

1:39:02.143 --> 1:39:03.010
Isaac?

1:39:07.914 --> 1:39:09.549
You should be asleep.

1:39:10.650 --> 1:39:11.885
I can't fall asleep.

1:39:13.753 --> 1:39:14.888
My mind's racing.

1:39:18.092 --> 1:39:19.126
I haven't really had
time to think

1:39:19.160 --> 1:39:20.727
about everything until now.

1:39:26.633 --> 1:39:30.237
It's a lot
to think about.

1:39:30.271 --> 1:39:32.872
It's so strange that
this happened to us.

1:39:36.077 --> 1:39:37.744
Seems like a dream.

1:39:38.878 --> 1:39:39.746
I know.

1:39:50.257 --> 1:39:52.659
Do you think everything
happens for a reason?

1:39:56.863 --> 1:39:59.200
Or is everything just
completely random,

1:39:59.233 --> 1:40:01.568
there's no meaning and
purpose or anything?

1:40:03.670 --> 1:40:05.039
It's just so strange how life

1:40:05.072 --> 1:40:05.872
brings people together.

1:40:05.905 --> 1:40:08.042
I mean we were
complete strangers.

1:40:10.077 --> 1:40:11.012
If it weren't for this

1:40:11.045 --> 1:40:13.014
we wouldn't even know
each other existed.

1:40:16.317 --> 1:40:17.151
I know that sounds crazy

1:40:17.184 --> 1:40:19.120
but I think about that
stuff sometimes.

1:40:26.626 --> 1:40:28.661
Anyway I'm just glad
that I met someone

1:40:28.695 --> 1:40:30.164
like you who understands.

1:40:43.877 --> 1:40:44.744
Me too.

1:40:47.048 --> 1:40:48.315
Good night.

1:40:48.349 --> 1:40:49.616
Good night.

1:41:31.724 --> 1:41:32.592
What?

1:41:34.894 --> 1:41:36.163
You feel that?

1:41:47.740 --> 1:41:48.842
You feel that?

1:41:50.677 --> 1:41:51.644
They're close.

1:42:10.064 --> 1:42:11.764
Isaac!

1:42:11.798 --> 1:42:12.799
Isaac, stop!

1:42:15.369 --> 1:42:16.936
Where's he going?

1:42:16.970 --> 1:42:17.937
Dammit, Isaac.

1:42:17.971 --> 1:42:19.039
Let him go.

1:43:02.949 --> 1:43:04.418
What do you want?

1:43:20.767 --> 1:43:22.336
Why did you take us?

1:43:27.174 --> 1:43:29.742
We have conquered
science, medicine,

1:43:29.776 --> 1:43:32.779
technology and the
physical world.

1:43:36.483 --> 1:43:38.152
We search for something greater

1:43:38.185 --> 1:43:40.787
beyond our understanding.

1:43:44.391 --> 1:43:46.859
We've searched for the
origin of the universe,

1:43:47.927 --> 1:43:49.862
the greatest
conceivable existent.

1:43:54.001 --> 1:43:55.369
Why us?

1:43:58.239 --> 1:43:59.440
I mean, why us?

1:44:06.447 --> 1:44:09.083
We study humans
because they have measurable

1:44:09.116 --> 1:44:12.986
amounts of this aura
living within them.

1:44:16.490 --> 1:44:19.493
We would like to ask
you a question.

1:44:27.268 --> 1:44:32.239
Who is this?

1:44:54.161 --> 1:44:55.562
Why are you looking for him?

1:44:58.365 --> 1:45:01.502
He is a link to
the origin of everything.

1:45:04.904 --> 1:45:07.574
In our observations he
is the greatest

1:45:07.608 --> 1:45:10.177
common factor in humans
with strong amounts

1:45:10.210 --> 1:45:11.978
of this aura.

1:45:12.646 --> 1:45:13.580
Who is it?

1:45:15.482 --> 1:45:16.383
Jesus.

1:45:24.325 --> 1:45:26.193
This answers
our question.

1:45:31.031 --> 1:45:33.300
Have we answered your questions?

1:45:35.302 --> 1:45:36.437
Why do our arms hurt?

1:45:38.572 --> 1:45:40.007
Ever since we were taken,

1:45:41.375 --> 1:45:42.975
our arms felt strange.

1:46:05.032 --> 1:46:05.898
Relax.

1:46:32.493 --> 1:46:34.927
You were implanted with
tracking devices

1:46:34.961 --> 1:46:36.163
for our records.

1:47:06.026 --> 1:47:08.095
Isaac, your struggle for proof

1:47:08.128 --> 1:47:12.232
is impossible in the world
where seeing is believing.

1:47:15.335 --> 1:47:19.273
We have come to understand
that believing is seeing.

1:47:24.178 --> 1:47:26.547
Alarm,
motion detector.

1:47:47.334 --> 1:47:48.469
They tracked us!

1:47:48.502 --> 1:47:49.403
We're surrounded!

1:47:56.510 --> 1:47:59.580
Carl, I need you to
come out front please.

1:48:10.424 --> 1:48:13.193
The cabin is surrounded,
come outside.

1:48:19.500 --> 1:48:20.367
Carl.

1:48:22.336 --> 1:48:23.237
Carl!

1:48:26.640 --> 1:48:28.442
We can make this a lot easier.

1:48:30.077 --> 1:48:31.411
All I need is for you to tell me

1:48:31.445 --> 1:48:33.280
what happened to Ronald Graves.

1:48:35.849 --> 1:48:38.151
I'm giving you one chance

1:48:38.185 --> 1:48:40.053
to come outside and
talk about this.

1:48:45.125 --> 1:48:45.792
Fine!

1:48:47.227 --> 1:48:48.328
Have it your way.

1:48:48.362 --> 1:48:50.297
You have one minute to
exit the cabin!

1:49:00.140 --> 1:49:01.275
William!

1:49:01.308 --> 1:49:03.143
You need to take your
guys and leave.

1:49:04.344 --> 1:49:05.812
I told you before I
don't know what happened

1:49:05.846 --> 1:49:06.513
to your father.

1:49:06.547 --> 1:49:08.181
I've got nothing to tell you!

1:49:08.215 --> 1:49:10.417
You're gonna play
that card again?

1:49:10.450 --> 1:49:11.585
'Cause I've heard that before.

1:49:12.753 --> 1:49:15.088
You're looking for
answers nobody has!

1:49:15.122 --> 1:49:16.456
Nobody saw what happened!

1:49:16.490 --> 1:49:17.658
I told you the truth.

1:49:18.892 --> 1:49:21.728
No, you know what
happened to him.

1:49:21.762 --> 1:49:23.764
You're the only one who
failed the test.

1:49:24.765 --> 1:49:25.799
Why didn't he return?

1:49:25.832 --> 1:49:28.735
This was nothing anybody
could have predicted!

1:49:28.769 --> 1:49:29.670
They were all in the truck

1:49:29.703 --> 1:49:31.371
when I checked on them.

1:49:33.140 --> 1:49:34.008
Carl!

1:49:34.042 --> 1:49:35.576
It's the last I saw
of your father.

1:49:35.609 --> 1:49:37.344
Carl, just come back inside.

1:49:37.377 --> 1:49:38.178
Carl, come inside.

1:49:38.211 --> 1:49:39.580
Mothers and if you
can't accept it,

1:49:39.613 --> 1:49:41.648
I've got nothing more to say.

1:49:41.682 --> 1:49:42.549
That's a lie.

1:49:49.423 --> 1:49:50.357
Shoot him.

1:49:52.659 --> 1:49:53.627
Carl!

1:49:53.660 --> 1:49:54.494
Carl!

1:49:54.528 --> 1:49:55.629
No, Sara!

1:49:55.662 --> 1:49:56.530
Dammit.

1:49:57.531 --> 1:49:59.600
Ah, there are the others.

1:49:59.633 --> 1:50:00.500
Carl.

1:50:02.336 --> 1:50:04.538
Sara, what are you
doing, get back in here!

1:50:04.571 --> 1:50:05.439
Carl.

1:50:06.406 --> 1:50:07.307
Sara, get back inside!

1:50:07.341 --> 1:50:09.509
See what happens when
you don't comply?

1:50:09.543 --> 1:50:10.777
It's real easy for us.

1:50:13.747 --> 1:50:15.115
What's wrong with you?

1:50:16.583 --> 1:50:17.451
Sara!

1:50:22.889 --> 1:50:23.857
Okay, her too.

1:50:25.626 --> 1:50:26.493
Sara!

1:50:29.229 --> 1:50:31.164
Stop, hurry up!

1:50:36.503 --> 1:50:37.638
Isaac, you need to come out,

1:50:37.671 --> 1:50:39.539
it's not looking good for you.

1:50:40.440 --> 1:50:42.342
Your plan is falling apart.

1:50:46.380 --> 1:50:47.247
Isaac.

1:50:48.682 --> 1:50:50.617
Use your senses.

1:50:51.818 --> 1:50:52.686
Focus.

1:51:11.571 --> 1:51:12.406
Fire!

1:52:49.003 --> 1:52:50.837
Where'd they go?

1:52:57.611 --> 1:52:58.478
Where's?

1:52:59.646 --> 1:53:01.015
What just happened?

1:53:23.104 --> 1:53:24.571
What happened?

1:55:00.834 --> 1:55:02.435
The way we
escaped the cabin that day,

1:55:02.469 --> 1:55:03.737
it's not really something
you can explain

1:55:03.770 --> 1:55:05.605
that makes sense to a
normal person.

1:55:06.606 --> 1:55:08.009
I'm still learning myself.

1:55:09.542 --> 1:55:10.777
Sara was right though.

1:55:10.810 --> 1:55:11.745
Something did change us.

1:55:14.481 --> 1:55:16.117
What I can say though is
at the end of all this

1:55:16.150 --> 1:55:18.052
I met a girl who I fell
in love with.

1:55:22.822 --> 1:55:25.759
Have you ever
broken a bone?

1:55:25.792 --> 1:55:26.726
I have, yeah.

1:55:26.760 --> 1:55:28.162
Yeah, which one?

1:55:29.696 --> 1:55:30.697
We moved far away.

1:55:31.932 --> 1:55:32.966
Took up normal lives.

1:55:40.740 --> 1:55:43.810
Well at least as normal
as it could be.

1:55:43.843 --> 1:55:45.079
Zed teamed up with Carl

1:55:45.112 --> 1:55:46.947
and they work for Zuma now,

1:55:46.980 --> 1:55:49.883
a new underground Tech
Intelligence Agency.

1:55:49.916 --> 1:55:51.518
They're able to work remotely.

1:55:51.551 --> 1:55:53.254
They're pretty much starting
the new agency themselves

1:55:53.287 --> 1:55:54.155
and having fun.

1:55:56.623 --> 1:55:57.757
We found out through
the grapevine

1:55:57.791 --> 1:55:59.726
that Graves ended up
getting fired.

1:55:59.759 --> 1:56:02.495
I guess there's a line in
his field and he crossed it.

1:56:08.802 --> 1:56:11.038
I doubt anybody will see this

1:56:11.072 --> 1:56:12.505
but that's my story.

1:56:13.640 --> 1:56:14.841
So far anyway.

1:56:14.874 --> 1:56:16.143
Later.
