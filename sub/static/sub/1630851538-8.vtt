00:17.267 --> 00:20.353
Once upon a time,
fairy tales were awesome.

00:21.354 --> 00:22.772
We know, you don't believe us.

00:22.856 --> 00:26.359
You think fairy tales are cute
and pink and full of fairies.

00:27.736 --> 00:29.154
-Well, they're not.

00:29.237 --> 00:31.322
-Real fairy tales are scary.

00:33.491 --> 00:36.911
Follow two children
as they venture off into a dark tale.

00:36.995 --> 00:38.455
-A scary tale.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.290
-A strange tale.

00:41.332 --> 00:42.709
-A… Wait a minute.

00:42.792 --> 00:44.335
Are you even old enough for this?

00:44.419 --> 00:47.005
-You really think you can handle it?

00:54.012 --> 00:58.808
Once upon a time, the most faithful
servant in all the land died,

00:58.892 --> 01:01.603
leaving two children unsure
of what to do next.

01:01.686 --> 01:05.523
Ooh, spoiler alert,
we're near the end, like the end end.

01:05.607 --> 01:07.734
We're finally gonna be done
with this story.

01:07.817 --> 01:11.362
And then the curse will be broken
and we'll turn back into people again.

01:11.446 --> 01:14.616
Not me, bro. Raven for life!

01:14.699 --> 01:16.242
Whoo!

01:17.118 --> 01:18.536
We'll still hang out, right?

01:19.537 --> 01:21.623
-Uh, of course.
-Uh, I don't think so.

01:22.207 --> 01:24.959
I hope you never need these, Jojo.

01:25.043 --> 01:27.796
Do you realize what this means?

01:27.879 --> 01:32.634
Yeah, we're terrible at digging graves.
His foot's sticking out.

01:34.636 --> 01:38.014
It means we'll never find out
why our parents chopped off our heads.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.767
We'll never find out from him.

01:40.850 --> 01:43.895
We could still find out from them.

01:44.521 --> 01:46.940
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

01:47.023 --> 01:49.067
We swore we'd never go home again.

01:49.150 --> 01:51.069
Johannes really wanted us to go back.

01:51.152 --> 01:52.529
And he saved my life.

01:52.612 --> 01:55.365
-I feel like we owe it to him.
-Absolutely not.

01:55.448 --> 01:57.158
Okay. Got it.

01:58.159 --> 02:00.370
-Come on.

02:01.079 --> 02:02.205
Where are you going?

02:02.789 --> 02:04.082
Home is that way.

02:04.165 --> 02:05.291
Yeah, I know.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.460
I just have a few things to take care of.

02:08.169 --> 02:09.087
You coming?

02:09.170 --> 02:10.588
I'm not going home.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.635
But I'll walk and I'll talk.

02:15.718 --> 02:18.263
Good. It's fun to do things that rhyme.

02:18.346 --> 02:21.641
-Walk and talk and walk and talk…

02:21.724 --> 02:22.851
So, Hansel and Gretel--

02:22.934 --> 02:26.521
-They're going home, finally!
-They haven't said they're going home yet.

02:26.604 --> 02:29.858
Oh, sure.
Blah, blah, blah, but they're gonna.

02:29.941 --> 02:33.945
And then the story will finally be over,
and I get to be a person again.

02:34.028 --> 02:36.197
So let's move this story along, baby.

02:36.281 --> 02:39.784
So Hansel and Gretel went to the village
with the tree of gold apples,

02:39.868 --> 02:42.412
and the guy there was like,
"Hey, you're that kid."

02:42.495 --> 02:46.124
And Hansel was like, "The Devil put
a mouse under your gold apple tree."

02:46.207 --> 02:49.002
And the guy was like,
"Get out of there, mouse!"

02:49.085 --> 02:51.963
And the tree was like,
"Here's a bunch of gold apples."

02:52.046 --> 02:53.715
And everyone was super happy.

02:53.798 --> 02:57.677
So they gave Hansel a cart
full of gold apples and a horse!

02:59.179 --> 03:00.388
Did you have coffee?

03:00.471 --> 03:04.350
Hansel and Gretel went to the other place,
the other guy was like, "It's that kid."

03:04.434 --> 03:07.437
Hansel was like, "There's a frog
under your chocolate fountain."

03:07.520 --> 03:10.481
The guy was like, "Get the frog!"
The frog was like, "Oh no!"

03:10.565 --> 03:12.984
They gave Hansel a big cart
full of chocolate cake.

03:13.067 --> 03:14.861
He's totally gonna get another horse!

03:14.944 --> 03:17.947
And then they were practically home!

03:19.073 --> 03:21.159
And now they're back on the road!

03:21.242 --> 03:24.078
Booyah! That's how you move a story along!

03:25.246 --> 03:27.624
You guys have to tell me what coffee is.

03:34.756 --> 03:37.884
So you stole hairs
from the Devil's actual head?

03:37.967 --> 03:40.553
Yeah, and I can't believe
you beat a warlock

03:40.637 --> 03:43.181
and rescued a bunch of girls
who were stuck in birds.

03:43.264 --> 03:44.891
Sort… of.

03:48.144 --> 03:50.521
Gretel, I think we should go home.

03:50.605 --> 03:51.522
No.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.859
But… I don't know.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.195
Things could be different now.

03:57.278 --> 04:02.325
After all we've been through,
we might get a little more… respect?

04:02.408 --> 04:06.663
Hmm. Chopping off someone's head
is very disrespectful.

04:07.163 --> 04:11.084
If we did go back,
I bet things would be a lot different.

04:11.167 --> 04:12.919
We're not little kids anymore.

04:13.962 --> 04:16.339
Do you think
we'd still be in our same old room?

04:16.422 --> 04:17.298
Maybe.

04:17.882 --> 04:20.802
Do you think Chef
still does Weiner Wednesdays?

04:20.885 --> 04:21.761
Maybe.

04:22.470 --> 04:25.223
Do you think… they miss us?

04:25.306 --> 04:27.225
Too much cake.

04:27.892 --> 04:30.687
Getting… sleepy.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.774
-Whoa.
-Huh?

04:35.316 --> 04:37.860
-What happened here?

04:37.944 --> 04:39.529
It's Mrs. Baker's cottage!

04:41.322 --> 04:42.824
Ugh. This place.

04:42.907 --> 04:45.868
I was just getting
to where I could eat cake again.

04:45.952 --> 04:48.496
Wait. I remember
how to get home from here.

04:48.579 --> 04:49.706
-Hee-ya!

04:49.789 --> 04:53.167
Hansel, we still haven't decided
that's where we're going!

05:13.229 --> 05:15.189
-Whoa!

05:37.003 --> 05:38.087
Race you!

05:38.171 --> 05:39.088
Hansel!

05:39.714 --> 05:42.967
I bet if we go home,
they'll be proud of us.

05:43.051 --> 05:45.845
I bet they'll have
a big celebration with fireworks!

05:45.928 --> 05:47.180
Maybe.

05:47.263 --> 05:50.016
Let's walk through the village
and see how we feel about it.

05:50.099 --> 05:51.351
Okay.

06:15.583 --> 06:18.044
-Are you the Prince and Princess?

06:18.127 --> 06:21.255
Yes, we are. How did you know that?

06:21.339 --> 06:24.384
Your faces were on the milk jugs
for the longest time.

06:24.967 --> 06:27.178
Oh, it's so wonderful that you're back.

06:27.261 --> 06:29.597
Now everything's going to be all right!

06:30.640 --> 06:31.641
Maybe.

06:31.724 --> 06:33.518
Here you go, little girl.

06:33.601 --> 06:36.896
-Thank you for welcoming us home.

06:40.733 --> 06:41.609
Ow!

06:41.692 --> 06:43.986
What the… Is this a joke?

06:44.070 --> 06:46.364
Oh, very funny, trick the little girl.

06:47.115 --> 06:49.659
-Ah, I think I broke a tooth!

06:49.742 --> 06:51.327
You're welcome!

06:51.411 --> 06:52.328
Jerks.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.882
Where is everybody?

07:04.966 --> 07:07.760
It's weird. It's like they're all hiding.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.971
Well, are we going home?

07:10.555 --> 07:13.808
I mean… we're kind of already home.

07:13.891 --> 07:16.811
We could just… go talk to them.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.314
Okay.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.942
Yes! Ivy and Betty, you wait here.

07:25.319 --> 07:26.737
You named the horses?

07:26.821 --> 07:30.366
I name everything.
My shoes are Karl and Ludwig.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.367
Come on.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.591
It's coming from the blue room.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.563
-Gretel! Hansel!

08:02.231 --> 08:04.692
You're alive! Alive!

08:07.695 --> 08:09.322
My children!

08:20.249 --> 08:21.626
Look at you, Hansel.

08:21.709 --> 08:23.920
So grown up and handsome.

08:24.003 --> 08:28.382
And, Gretel, you've gotten tall enough
to put your foot in a horse's mouth.

08:28.925 --> 08:29.759
Attention!

08:30.760 --> 08:33.846
Our children have returned!

08:33.930 --> 08:37.308
This calls for a celebration!
We'll need fireworks.

08:37.391 --> 08:38.684
-Fireworks?
-Yes!

08:38.768 --> 08:40.269
Lots of fireworks!

08:41.687 --> 08:45.733
Also, this calls for a royal cleaning!

08:45.816 --> 08:47.860
But we have to ask you
about why you chopped--

08:51.447 --> 08:53.533
-You're pulling!

08:53.616 --> 08:55.451
-That tickles.

08:57.495 --> 08:59.205
-Huh?

08:59.288 --> 09:01.165
Okay, we watch the fireworks,

09:01.249 --> 09:03.626
and then we ask them
why they chopped our heads off.

09:03.709 --> 09:07.129
We're almost there.
This is almost the end.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.507
Ooh, when it's over can we do it again?

09:09.590 --> 09:12.677
No! When it's over,
we'll turn back into people!

09:12.760 --> 09:15.429
Only if we finish
telling the story, Jacob.

09:17.390 --> 09:22.019
Once upon a time, two children looked
for some answers from their parents.

09:22.103 --> 09:25.398
Boom! Some kinda pole
straight through his chest.

09:25.481 --> 09:27.692
Bled out slowly.

09:27.775 --> 09:31.195
-This bread is amazing. Is it rye?

09:33.072 --> 09:35.449
Johannes is dead?

09:35.533 --> 09:36.534
Yeah.

09:36.617 --> 09:37.952
Sorry.

09:38.035 --> 09:39.453
He was a good guy.

09:39.537 --> 09:41.747
He told us the whole story of how you met,

09:41.831 --> 09:44.125
and all the curses
and how he turned to stone.

09:44.208 --> 09:47.545
After all that, I can't believe he's dead.

09:48.671 --> 09:51.674
The point is,
he didn't get to the important part.

09:52.174 --> 09:53.509
-You know?

09:54.093 --> 09:58.264
My dear baby girl,
now is not the time for such things.

09:58.347 --> 10:02.351
Perhaps we'll discuss it
on a more appropriate occasion.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.437
Let's enjoy our reunion.

10:06.647 --> 10:09.400
I don't think we can do that just yet.

10:09.483 --> 10:10.901
I beg your pardon?

10:10.985 --> 10:12.486
We have to ask you…

10:13.070 --> 10:14.905
Why did you chop off our heads?!

10:17.742 --> 10:19.619
-Um… Uh…
-Uh…

10:19.702 --> 10:22.622
-Well… Uh… You see…
-Uh… Ooh, I…

10:22.705 --> 10:26.792
We're not little kids anymore.
You can tell us. Please.

10:29.086 --> 10:30.129
Very well.

10:30.212 --> 10:32.465
Where in the story did Johannes leave off?

10:32.548 --> 10:34.300
The part where he turned to stone.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.928
Once upon a time, Johannes turned to stone

10:38.012 --> 10:40.806
because I didn't trust him
when I should have.

10:41.432 --> 10:44.769
-We hid his statue in the blue room.

10:44.852 --> 10:47.772
Your mother thought
it would be best to keep it out of sight.

10:47.855 --> 10:51.108
But I was drawn to it again and again.

10:51.692 --> 10:53.569
-It haunted me.

10:53.653 --> 10:57.239
My guilt grew to unspeakable heights.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.324
Then, one night…

11:00.409 --> 11:02.203
I couldn't take it any longer.

11:09.085 --> 11:11.587
-My… My King.

11:11.671 --> 11:12.922
Johannes!

11:13.005 --> 11:14.340
Johannes?

11:14.423 --> 11:15.424
He's alive!

11:15.508 --> 11:17.510
…not alive.

11:17.593 --> 11:21.013
My body is still in the stone.

11:21.097 --> 11:23.182
Then, what is happening?

11:23.265 --> 11:26.352
Your tears
have allowed me to speak.

11:26.435 --> 11:28.062
How is that possible?

11:28.729 --> 11:31.899
Tears hold a bit of the soul,

11:31.982 --> 11:34.944
and the soul has magic.

11:35.027 --> 11:37.988
So, are you in this stone?

11:38.072 --> 11:40.991
I am speaking to you
through the stone,

11:41.075 --> 11:43.244
but in reality I am in Hell.

11:44.745 --> 11:49.834
There is a way for you to rescue me
from this fate if you truly wish.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.919
-Yes. Of course.
-Whatever it takes!

11:52.002 --> 11:54.255
Are you… certain?

11:55.089 --> 11:57.883
-Whatever it takes.

11:57.967 --> 12:00.177
Then listen closely.

12:00.761 --> 12:03.764
You must chop off your children's heads

12:03.848 --> 12:08.144
and smear their blood
on the stone that is my statue.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.691
-Hello? Are you still there?

12:13.774 --> 12:15.151
Is this stone on?

12:15.234 --> 12:17.653
Yes. We… We heard you.

12:18.404 --> 12:21.407
-The end! Okay, who wants cake?

12:21.949 --> 12:24.034
Please tell me there's more to the story.

12:24.118 --> 12:25.077
There has to be.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.620
Well, of course.

12:26.704 --> 12:31.083
Johannes gave us a spool of golden thread
that we used to sew your heads back on.

12:31.167 --> 12:34.420
-Yes, the golden hairs.

12:34.503 --> 12:36.797
See, we knew
you weren't going to stay dead…

12:36.881 --> 12:38.841
Mmm. Mmm!

12:38.924 --> 12:40.217
Probably.

12:40.301 --> 12:44.472
That's it? There's no secret reason you
can't tell us that'll make us feel better?

12:44.555 --> 12:46.223
Hmm…

12:46.307 --> 12:49.894
Nope. That is it,
the true end to the story.

12:54.690 --> 12:56.984
But what's important is that you're back.

12:57.067 --> 12:59.528
-And we love you very much.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.071
Forget about the past.

13:01.155 --> 13:03.908
You children couldn't possibly understand.

13:07.745 --> 13:10.790
Now, if we could please get to dessert.

13:11.957 --> 13:14.251
Stop acting like we're little children!

13:14.335 --> 13:16.337
We are not going to change the subject!

13:16.420 --> 13:17.755
We're not finished here!

13:17.838 --> 13:19.840
Why didn't you tell us what you'd do?

13:19.924 --> 13:22.510
What were we supposed to say, dear?

13:22.593 --> 13:26.597
"Excuse us, may we chop off your heads
to save an old man you don't know?"

13:26.680 --> 13:30.935
You never would have agreed to that
because you were too young to understand.

13:31.018 --> 13:32.853
No, because it's crazy!

13:32.937 --> 13:36.315
The least you could have done
was explain it after you did it!

13:36.398 --> 13:38.651
We were going to, but you ran off!

13:38.734 --> 13:41.028
Because you chopped off our heads!

13:42.655 --> 13:47.326
You have to understand,
we did what we thought was right.

13:47.409 --> 13:49.787
It was the hardest decision
we've ever made.

13:49.870 --> 13:53.749
And you have no idea the suffering
we've been through since you disappeared.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.085
It's been very hard on us.

13:58.295 --> 14:02.007
You chopped off our heads,
and this has been hard on you?

14:04.552 --> 14:06.262
We're so sorry.

14:07.221 --> 14:09.807
How can we make it up to you?

14:09.890 --> 14:12.518
Come on, Gretel.
We're going to bed.

14:16.397 --> 14:19.149
So that's it? That's all we get?

14:19.233 --> 14:20.568
Yep.

14:20.651 --> 14:23.737
I thought when we found out
why they chopped off our heads, it…

14:23.821 --> 14:25.281
it would fix everything.

14:25.781 --> 14:28.075
But it didn't. Not at all.

14:28.158 --> 14:29.451
Nope.

14:30.369 --> 14:32.121
-Gretel?

14:32.997 --> 14:33.914
Yes?

14:34.874 --> 14:35.916
My feet are cold.

14:37.084 --> 14:40.754
And so, the questions were answered,
the family was reunited,

14:40.838 --> 14:42.840
and they all lived happily…

14:43.507 --> 14:46.010
happily ever, uh, after.

14:46.093 --> 14:48.387
Well… Well, they all lived happily…

14:48.470 --> 14:49.847
They… Hmm…

14:50.598 --> 14:53.475
Well, they all lived… for a while.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.185
-The end.

14:56.478 --> 14:57.563
I said, "The end."

14:58.063 --> 14:59.148
Ta-da!

15:01.275 --> 15:03.819
Come on, cue the music! End the curse!

15:06.363 --> 15:08.866
Ugh, you guys stink at telling endings.

15:08.949 --> 15:11.535
Oh, baby, human again!

15:12.077 --> 15:15.623
Ah!

15:16.248 --> 15:17.458
Are we still ravens?

15:17.541 --> 15:19.168
We're totally still ravens.

15:19.251 --> 15:20.294
But why?!

15:20.377 --> 15:23.047
We told the story!
That was supposed to break the curse.

15:23.130 --> 15:26.467
We told it all the way
up to the present! It's now!

15:26.550 --> 15:29.887
Hansel and Gretel
are in that castle right now!

15:29.970 --> 15:32.514
They're trying to go to sleep right now!

15:32.598 --> 15:36.226
Their feet are cold right now!

15:36.310 --> 15:40.105
There's no more story left to tell!
Why hasn't the curse been broken?!

15:40.189 --> 15:42.608
Why haven't we turned back into humans?!

15:42.691 --> 15:44.652
I don't know. Quit pulling on my feathers!

15:44.735 --> 15:47.988
What's wrong with you guys?
This story obviously isn't over yet.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.490
What do you mean?

15:49.573 --> 15:53.202
Any idiot could see it's not over
until the family is back together.

15:53.285 --> 15:57.247
They might be in the same place,
but they're not together.

15:58.540 --> 16:01.710
-Together! Right!
-Together. Yes. Ah, yes. Absolutely, yes.

16:01.794 --> 16:02.670
You didn't know.

16:02.753 --> 16:05.923
Also, remember that dying guy
said something about, like,

16:06.006 --> 16:08.634
-a darkness falling over the kingdom?

16:08.717 --> 16:09.760
Yes?

16:09.843 --> 16:13.013
Well, I think we're about to find out
what he was talking about.

16:18.435 --> 16:20.813
Oh, what are we gonna do?!

16:20.896 --> 16:24.733
Hey, get it together, man!
We are gonna tell this story!

16:24.817 --> 16:28.028
What? You mean without a script?
I can't do that!

16:28.112 --> 16:30.114
-I can't improvise!

16:30.197 --> 16:33.575
Pull yourself together, man!
The show must go on!

16:33.659 --> 16:35.661
All right.

16:36.870 --> 16:39.790
Once upon a… …now…

16:39.873 --> 16:43.252
-Oh, that's a good start.
-…a young girl and boy were doing…

16:43.335 --> 16:45.045
-What are they doing?
-I don't know!

16:45.129 --> 16:46.964
-Well, let's go see!
-Brilliant!

16:47.673 --> 16:50.300
Guys, do you think
that dragon is out of my league?

16:50.384 --> 16:54.263
I mean, I could maybe just say "Hi,"
or "Wanna hang out someti…"

16:54.346 --> 16:56.515
Hey, guys! Guys?

17:02.062 --> 17:04.648
-You been staring out that window?
-Yep.

17:05.524 --> 17:07.192
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

17:07.276 --> 17:10.988
Yep. And I agree. That would be
the perfect window to pee from.

17:11.071 --> 17:12.906
What? Ew. No.

17:12.990 --> 17:16.618
Hansel, it's time to leave… again.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.078
Yeah, I guess we--

17:18.162 --> 17:19.413
-Ah!

17:21.206 --> 17:24.418
-What was that?

17:26.170 --> 17:27.212
Whoa!

17:37.181 --> 17:40.476
-Of course there's a dragon. Of course!

17:42.352 --> 17:44.480
-Run for your lives!

17:46.690 --> 17:48.192
We've gotta do something!

17:48.275 --> 17:50.360
Oh, we're gonna do something.

17:50.444 --> 17:53.906
-Oh, come on, not the stool again.

17:53.989 --> 17:57.201
Oh, yeah. It's stool redemption time.

18:04.458 --> 18:05.709
Come with me.

18:07.086 --> 18:07.961
You're crazy!

18:08.045 --> 18:09.338
Who isn't?

18:11.965 --> 18:14.051
-Here we go!

18:15.260 --> 18:16.512
-Ha!

18:24.770 --> 18:27.147
-Come on!

18:31.693 --> 18:34.321
Uh, villagers flee in panic, uh…

18:34.404 --> 18:39.034
…while… as the dragon overhead
rains destruction upon the entire--

18:39.118 --> 18:41.912
We can see what's happening.
You don't need to say anything.

18:41.995 --> 18:43.580
I'm just trying to do my job.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.874
He's probably already
got a girlfriend, right?

18:45.958 --> 18:47.668
I mean, the dragon? Yeah?

18:47.751 --> 18:50.462
-Run for your lives!

18:55.092 --> 18:56.969
Everyone, to the castle!

18:57.052 --> 19:00.222
-Please! You'll be safer there.

19:00.305 --> 19:02.516
We're peasants.
We're not allowed in the castle.

19:02.599 --> 19:05.227
You are now. Go! Go! Go!

19:09.398 --> 19:11.650
Get them to the castle!
I'll catch up with you!

19:11.733 --> 19:12.943
Go! Hurry!

19:14.444 --> 19:16.321
Help! Help!

19:16.989 --> 19:18.740
Help!

19:18.824 --> 19:20.075
Help!

19:30.669 --> 19:31.920
-Oh no!
-What?

19:35.257 --> 19:37.176
-Are you all right?

19:37.259 --> 19:38.177
Yeah.

19:38.719 --> 19:39.845
-Ow!

19:39.928 --> 19:42.848
That's for giving me a trick apple, jerk.

19:46.852 --> 19:50.647
-Should we raise the drawbridge now?
-Not yet. Hansel isn't back.

19:52.357 --> 19:56.528
Okay, yeah, so we're going
to raise the drawbridge like you said.

19:56.612 --> 19:57.946
I said don't!

19:58.030 --> 20:00.324
-Yee-haw! Giddy-up!

20:00.407 --> 20:02.534
-Hansel! Hurry!

20:05.078 --> 20:07.206
-Catch!

20:07.289 --> 20:08.332
Whee!

20:08.415 --> 20:10.876
Oh, my baby!

20:10.959 --> 20:12.544
Stay there. I'll be okay!

20:14.796 --> 20:16.506
-We're in this together.

20:16.590 --> 20:18.675
I think you broke my ribs.

20:18.759 --> 20:19.801
-Ach!

20:19.885 --> 20:20.761
-Ah!

20:24.598 --> 20:26.934
-The fireworks!

20:41.573 --> 20:42.532
Run!

21:08.809 --> 21:10.060
-It worked!
-Amazing!

21:11.270 --> 21:14.606
The King and Queen!
Where are the King and Queen?

21:18.360 --> 21:20.570
-Come on!

21:21.822 --> 21:23.907
-Mom? Dad?
-Mom?

21:23.991 --> 21:26.451
-Mom, Dad, where are you guys?
-Where'd you guys go?

21:28.203 --> 21:29.037
Huh?

21:31.456 --> 21:33.875
Oh! Ahem. Hello.

21:36.628 --> 21:39.339
Oh, thank heavens you're all right!

21:39.423 --> 21:43.802
I had fallen asleep in the library
when I heard that terrible beast.

21:43.885 --> 21:46.013
I had hoped it would never return.

21:46.096 --> 21:49.182
Return? Wait, it's been here before?

21:49.266 --> 21:53.020
-Well, yes, but--
-Let's not talk about that right now.

21:53.603 --> 21:55.522
What? We nearly got killed!

21:55.605 --> 21:57.190
What were you doing out there?

21:57.274 --> 22:00.235
Saving people!
Now tell us what's going on!

22:01.486 --> 22:06.325
For months, the kingdom
has been plagued by this creature.

22:06.408 --> 22:07.617
Where did it come from?

22:07.701 --> 22:09.619
We don't know.

22:09.703 --> 22:12.372
The Royal Secretary
of Demons and Agriculture

22:12.456 --> 22:15.459
says it's an evil spirit
that has been possessed by someone

22:15.542 --> 22:19.504
so consumed by despair
that their soul has become vulnerable.

22:19.588 --> 22:24.176
But he also says sneezing
is caused by gremlins, so…

22:24.259 --> 22:27.888
The dragon comes without warning
and vanishes without a trace.

22:27.971 --> 22:29.931
Countless subjects have lost their lives.

22:30.015 --> 22:32.684
Well, you children don't have to worry.

22:32.768 --> 22:35.103
Yes. The adults will deal with this.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.397
-Who wants cake?
-Really?

22:37.481 --> 22:40.359
Deal with it? Like you did just now?

22:40.442 --> 22:43.153
You were sleeping,
and you were hiding in a wardrobe.

22:43.236 --> 22:47.282
In my defense, you would have been
hiding too, if you'd been in a wardrobe.

22:47.366 --> 22:50.869
Why don't you guys cut off the dragon's
head? Isn't that what you're good at?

22:50.952 --> 22:52.829
Oh, man, that's nasty.

22:52.913 --> 22:56.291
This is adult business!
It's not a matter for children!

22:56.375 --> 23:01.088
Show of hands, who here chopped off
their own finger to save seven boys?

23:01.171 --> 23:03.673
Who here got killed by hunters
and came back to life?

23:03.757 --> 23:05.258
Who here defeated a warlock?

23:05.342 --> 23:08.053
Who here went to Hell,
tricked the Devil, and escaped?

23:08.136 --> 23:11.264
And who here
chopped off their own kids' heads?

23:14.393 --> 23:18.271
I think we all can see
who isn't acting like adults.

23:19.272 --> 23:20.440
Do you want us to stay?

23:20.524 --> 23:21.483
Yes!

23:21.566 --> 23:24.403
-That's all we want.
-Then we're in charge.

23:27.697 --> 23:31.576
If we allow this,
will you forgive us for what we've done?

23:31.660 --> 23:34.830
Perhaps we'll discuss it
on a more appropriate occasion.

23:37.958 --> 23:40.085
Ugh. This is way too big.

23:40.168 --> 23:44.714
This one's sticky. Why is it sticky?
Were you hiding cake in your crown?

23:46.675 --> 23:48.051
Yes.

23:49.052 --> 23:52.514
Okay, the first thing
we're gonna do is kill that dragon.

23:52.597 --> 23:54.599
How on earth do you plan to do that?

23:54.683 --> 23:57.811
We tried it and it incinerated
our entire army in minutes.

23:57.894 --> 23:59.896
By using our heads.

23:59.980 --> 24:02.232
-And our hearts!

24:04.609 --> 24:05.444
And…

24:05.527 --> 24:07.821
Um… …and swords.

24:12.033 --> 24:13.910
Different swords.

24:13.994 --> 24:16.204
-And arrows.
-Flaming arrows.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.623
-Some sort of catapult.
-How about a slingshot?

24:18.707 --> 24:20.417
-A peashooter.
-We'll figure it out.

24:20.500 --> 24:24.504
Now why don't you two just go back
to what you were doing. Nothing.

24:24.588 --> 24:27.340
Whoa! It's getting real!

24:27.424 --> 24:30.760
So Hansel and Gretel did that
thing they just did. With the yelling.

24:30.844 --> 24:32.345
You're doing great, buddy.

24:32.429 --> 24:35.265
And then they left
and they did… are doing…

24:35.348 --> 24:39.186
uh, are going to do…
whatever they're going to do next!

24:39.269 --> 24:42.230
They-- They-- They-- They-- They-- They…

24:45.400 --> 24:46.860
I think his brain's broken.

24:46.943 --> 24:50.572
Don't worry, everybody's gonna stay for
the next part 'cause it has a cute dragon

24:50.655 --> 24:52.574
that I hope is single.

24:54.451 --> 24:58.580
Okay, I just want to point out
that this stuff is really happening now!

24:58.663 --> 25:01.041
We are all probably
gonna get killed by the dragon!

25:01.124 --> 25:04.711
-You bet, with his adorable fire breath.

25:09.049 --> 25:11.259
We are definitely going to die.
