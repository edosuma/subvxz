11:53.709 --> 11:56.542
I'M SORRY, IS, UH,

11:56.542 --> 11:57.709
- FUCK YEAH,
THIS IS MY HOUSE.

11:57.709 --> 11:58.792
- I MADE A MISTAKE.

11:58.792 --> 12:00.250
I THOUGHT
IT WAS MY FRIEND'S PLACE.

12:00.250 --> 12:02.083
- SO YOU'RE BREAKING
INTO YOUR FRIEND'S PLACE?

12:02.083 --> 12:04.667
- NO.
- YOU WERE GONNA STEAL MY SHIT.

12:04.667 --> 12:10.125
- I ASSURE YOU, I WAS NOT
GOING TO STEAL YOUR SHIT.

12:10.125 --> 12:11.625
- UH-UH.

12:11.625 --> 12:13.041
NO, YOU AIN'T
GOING ANYWHERE, OLD MAN.

12:13.041 --> 12:14.792
ALL RIGHT? I GOT
YOUR LICENSE PLATE NUMBER.

12:14.792 --> 12:17.500
I'M GONNA CALL THE COPS.

12:25.208 --> 12:27.333
- SORRY I'M LATE.
IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE DAYS.

12:27.333 --> 12:28.333
- OH, IT'S OKAY.

12:28.333 --> 12:29.333

12:41.917 --> 12:43.500
OKAY.

12:43.500 --> 12:46.500
YEAH, NO, I'LL BE THERE.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.959
- LET ME GUESS.
CRIME SCENE?

12:48.959 --> 12:50.667
DEXTER,
WE HAVE AN APPOINTMENT.

12:50.667 --> 12:52.291
- I KNOW, BUT IT'S--
IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

12:52.291 --> 12:55.583
- SO IS THIS.
- WHY?

12:55.583 --> 12:56.625
WE'RE DOING BETTER.

12:56.625 --> 12:58.208
I'M...

12:58.208 --> 13:00.917
BEING ALL OPEN, AND...

13:00.917 --> 13:05.333
- I KISSED ELLIOT.

13:05.333 --> 13:06.709
- WHAT?

13:06.709 --> 13:12.083
- WELL, ACTUALLY, UH,
HE KISSED ME, MOSTLY.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.709
LOOK,
I WAS WAITING TO TELL YOU.

13:14.709 --> 13:16.125
IN THERAPY.

13:16.125 --> 13:18.250
SO LET'S JUST GO
TO OUR SESSION, SO THAT WE--

13:18.250 --> 13:19.291
- NO, I TOLD YOU, I CAN'T.

13:19.291 --> 13:21.000
- DEXTER, PLEASE.

13:21.000 --> 13:26.041
- I GOT TO GET TO WORK.

13:26.041 --> 13:30.041
- 10-4.
THIS HAS BEEN RECONFIRMED.

13:30.041 --> 13:31.625
- I CAME OVER
TO BORROW HIS LAWNMOWER.

13:31.625 --> 13:33.125
I--I SAW HIM
THROUGH THE WINDOW.

13:33.125 --> 13:34.959
THE DOOR WAS UNLOCKED.

13:34.959 --> 13:38.291
- BRUISING AROUND THE NECK.
OUR GUY WAS CHOKED.

13:38.291 --> 13:40.667
HEY, UH, HOW WAS, UH,

13:40.667 --> 13:44.125
LUNCH/THERAPY

13:44.125 --> 13:45.542
- FINE.

13:45.542 --> 13:48.125
VINCE, STOP READING
MY DESKTOP CALENDAR.

13:48.125 --> 13:50.959
IMPACT MARKS
HERE ON THE FLOOR.

13:50.959 --> 13:52.625
- YOU CAN TALK TO ME,
YOU KNOW.

13:52.625 --> 13:56.834
- ACTUALLY,
MULTIPLE IMPACT MARKS.

13:56.834 --> 14:00.166
SOMEBODY SMASHED HIS HEAD
AGAINST THE FLOOR.

14:00.166 --> 14:03.667
- I SAW RITA KISSING ANOTHER
DUDE AT THANKSGIVING, OKAY?

14:03.667 --> 14:05.542
- I KNOW.
SHE TOLD ME.

14:05.542 --> 14:06.959
- OH, THANK CHRIST.

14:06.959 --> 14:09.458
- WE'VE LIVED NEXT DOOR
FIVE, SIX YEARS.

14:09.458 --> 14:10.834
- AND WHAT'S HIS NAME?

14:10.834 --> 14:15.125
- KYLE.
UH, KYLE BUTLER.

14:15.125 --> 14:18.125
- ARTHUR MITCHELL'S IN MIAMI,

14:18.125 --> 14:20.000
AND HE'S LOOKING FOR ME.

14:23.291 --> 14:25.291
ANOTHER DEATH
OF AN INNOCENT MAN

14:25.291 --> 14:27.959
THAT I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR.

14:34.625 --> 14:37.542
- SHOES.
AND MORE SHOES.

14:37.542 --> 14:39.750
- MAN,
CHRISTINE HAS A LOT OF SHOES.

14:39.750 --> 14:43.166
- SHOES. SHOES.

14:43.166 --> 14:44.291
SHOES.

14:44.291 --> 14:46.667
- NOT SHOES.

14:48.792 --> 14:54.375
DES MOINES,
DENVER, SAN FRANCISCO.

14:54.375 --> 14:57.417
- LET ME SEE.

14:57.417 --> 14:59.542
THESE ARE ALL CITIES
IN LUNDY'S BOOKS--

14:59.542 --> 15:05.583
WHERE TRINITY KILLED.

15:05.583 --> 15:07.291
LOOK HOW IT'S SIGNED.

15:07.291 --> 15:08.875
- "LOVE, DADDY."

15:08.875 --> 15:09.750
TRINITY IS--

15:09.750 --> 15:11.917
- CHRISTINE'S FUCKING FATHER.

15:11.917 --> 15:14.041
SHE'S BEEN IN CONTACT
WITH HIM THE WHOLE TIME.

15:14.041 --> 15:16.375
I KNEW IT. I FUCKIN' KNEW
SOMETHING WAS OFF WITH HER.

15:16.375 --> 15:18.083
- IT STILL DOESN'T
GIVE US TRINITY.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.208
- NO.

15:19.208 --> 15:23.458
BUT IT GIVES US SOMETHING
TO MAKE THE BITCH TALK.

15:23.458 --> 15:25.083
[bell rings]

15:25.083 --> 15:27.375
[distant voices]

15:47.083 --> 15:49.875
[dog barks]

15:53.208 --> 15:54.125
[door closes]

15:54.125 --> 15:58.083
- ARTHUR WILL COME HERE NEXT,

15:58.083 --> 16:00.333
AND I'LL BE WAITING.

16:12.500 --> 16:16.250
[brakes screech,
door closes]

16:25.959 --> 16:29.750
[door opens]

16:37.166 --> 16:40.500
SOON AS THAT DOOR CLOSES,
IT'S OVER.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.000
[door closes]

16:43.000 --> 16:45.250
WHAT THE FUCK?

16:45.250 --> 16:47.208
[distant voices]

16:47.208 --> 16:48.458
- GOOD NIGHT.

16:48.458 --> 16:51.333
- SEE YOU LATER.

16:51.333 --> 16:52.583
- SHIT.

16:52.583 --> 16:55.625
[engine starts,
car drives off]

16:55.625 --> 16:58.166
FUCK.

17:02.625 --> 17:05.083
- NOT MUCH OF A RESEMBLANCE.

17:05.083 --> 17:07.542
- AT LEAST HE'S NOT LOOKING
FOR KYLE BUTLER ANYMORE.

17:07.542 --> 17:10.208
- SAN FRANCISCO, 1996.

17:10.208 --> 17:12.333
SAME CYCLE.

17:12.333 --> 17:14.500
GIRL DIES IN A BATHTUB.

17:14.500 --> 17:17.041
A WOMAN JUMPS OFF A BUILDING.

17:17.041 --> 17:20.834
A MAN GETS BLUDGEONED
OUTSIDE OF A BAR.

17:20.834 --> 17:22.667
THERE WERE TRINITY KILLINGS

17:22.667 --> 17:25.417
IN EVERY SINGLE ONE
OF THESE CITIES.

17:29.417 --> 17:31.041
"WISH YOU WERE HERE.

17:31.041 --> 17:33.333
LOVE, DADDY."

17:40.834 --> 17:44.792
- I'VE NEVER
SEEN THOSE BEFORE.

17:44.792 --> 17:46.875
YOU PLANTED THEM.

17:46.875 --> 17:50.500
- ARE YOU TRYING
TO PISS ME OFF MORE?

17:50.500 --> 17:52.625
'CAUSE I'M SURE
THAT DETECTIVE QUINN

17:52.625 --> 17:55.917
WILL BE DISPLEASED

17:55.917 --> 17:57.959
WHEN HE FINDS OUT
THIS IS WHY

17:57.959 --> 18:00.208
YOU COZIED UP TO HIM,

18:00.208 --> 18:02.250
TO KEEP TABS ON DADDY.

18:02.250 --> 18:04.458
- I DIDN'T.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.083
I DON'T KNOW WHO MY FATHER IS.

18:06.083 --> 18:09.625
- HE IS THE TRINITY KILLER.

18:09.625 --> 18:14.667
AND HE'S BEEN SENDING YOU
POSTCARDS FROM HELL.

18:14.667 --> 18:17.291
YOU'VE BEEN DRAFTING ON US,

18:17.291 --> 18:20.583
AND WHEN YOU HEARD LUNDY
WAS ON TO YOUR FATHER,

18:20.583 --> 18:23.750
YOU SHOT HIM.

18:23.750 --> 18:26.417
- [exhales]

18:31.083 --> 18:33.166
I WANT TO TALK TO MY LAWYER.

18:33.166 --> 18:37.000
- FIRST SMART THING
YOU'VE SAID ALL DAY.

18:37.000 --> 18:37.959
- SHE LIED.

18:37.959 --> 18:39.750
- FUCK YEAH, SHE LIED.

18:39.750 --> 18:41.375
JUST FUCKING ADMIT IT.

18:41.375 --> 18:43.417
YOU SHOT ME
AND YOU KILLED LUNDY.

18:43.417 --> 18:45.375
- SHE FUCKING USED ME.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.458
AND I FELL FOR IT.

18:47.458 --> 18:49.667
FOR HER.

18:49.667 --> 18:51.625
I'M A FUCKIN' ASSHOLE.

18:51.625 --> 18:53.458
- DON'T--DON'T DO THAT.

18:53.458 --> 18:55.625
- WHAT?
- BEAT YOURSELF UP LIKE THAT.

18:55.625 --> 18:59.500
- WHY THE FUCK NOT?

18:59.500 --> 19:01.667
- BECAUSE I KNOW
WHERE IT GETS YOU.

19:01.667 --> 19:03.583
I WAS ENGAGED
TO THE ICE TRUCK KILLER.

19:03.583 --> 19:05.917
HELLO.

19:05.917 --> 19:07.125
HE CUT PEOPLE UP,

19:07.125 --> 19:08.500
DRAINED THEIR BLOOD,

19:08.500 --> 19:12.041
WRAPPED 'EM UP LIKE
BLOODY FUCKIN' CHRISTMAS.

19:12.041 --> 19:13.875
ENGAGED.

19:13.875 --> 19:17.875
AS IN READY TO SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE.

19:17.875 --> 19:19.041
- YEAH.

19:19.041 --> 19:21.709
- SO WE CAN PLAY
WHO'S A BIGGER ASSHOLE,

19:21.709 --> 19:24.792
BUT I GUARANTEE YOU
I'LL WIN.

19:24.792 --> 19:26.667
- WE'RE KEEPING CHRISTINE
OVERNIGHT AGAIN.

19:26.667 --> 19:28.959
- GOOD.
LET HER FUCKIN' ROT.

19:38.125 --> 19:41.083
- STAN BEAUDRY
LIVES OFF THE GRID.

19:41.083 --> 19:46.709
A SHACK
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

19:46.709 --> 19:49.166
LONE WOLF PERSONIFIED.

19:49.166 --> 19:51.667
HE'S NOT HOME.

19:51.667 --> 19:53.208
[indistinct voice]

19:53.208 --> 19:56.417
OR IS HE?

19:56.417 --> 20:03.000
[voice continues]

20:03.000 --> 20:04.208
- LOOK OUT FOR AN 18-WHEELER

20:04.208 --> 20:06.500
WITH A TACKLE BOX ON
THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR--

20:06.500 --> 20:08.000
[shuts off radio]

20:16.583 --> 20:19.417
- WHERE ARE YOU,
MR. BEAUDRY?

20:26.917 --> 20:28.875
MAKING A DELIVERY
IN JACKSONVILLE,

20:28.875 --> 20:30.500
DUE BACK LATE TOMORROW.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.083
OR IF I LEAVE NOW,

20:32.083 --> 20:33.625
I CAN BE IN JACKSONVILLE
BY MIDNIGHT,

20:33.625 --> 20:36.208
AND CUT THE TIME...
AND HIM...IN HALF.

20:36.208 --> 20:39.125
- YOU CAN'T JUST DISAPPEAR
ALL NIGHT, DEXTER.

20:39.125 --> 20:42.500
GOT TO GET HOME
TO YOUR FAMILY.

20:47.583 --> 20:48.667
- HEY.

20:48.667 --> 20:50.792
IT'S LATE.

20:50.792 --> 20:53.000
YOU CAN'T SLEEP?

20:53.000 --> 20:55.917
- I STAYED UP,
SO WE COULD FINISH OUR TALK.

20:55.917 --> 20:57.917
- CAN IT WAIT?

20:57.917 --> 21:00.208
I HAVE A HUGE DAY TOMORROW.

21:00.208 --> 21:02.834
- NO, IT CAN'T.

21:02.834 --> 21:04.583
- ARE THE TWO OF YOU--?

21:04.583 --> 21:05.667
- NO.

21:05.667 --> 21:07.041
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

21:07.041 --> 21:09.625
IT'S JUST A HUGE MISTAKE,

21:09.625 --> 21:11.917
AND I AM SO--SO SORRY.

21:11.917 --> 21:13.583
- WELL, OKAY THEN.

21:13.583 --> 21:17.333
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

21:17.333 --> 21:19.417
- SHOULDN'T WE
TALK ABOUT THIS?

21:19.417 --> 21:23.166
- I THOUGHT WE JUST DID.

21:23.166 --> 21:26.041
- YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

21:26.041 --> 21:28.417
- I'M PUTTING IT BEHIND ME.

21:28.417 --> 21:29.917
ISN'T THAT
WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO?

21:29.917 --> 21:31.875
- I MEAN, I'M GLAD,

21:31.875 --> 21:33.709
BUT IF I WERE YOU,

21:33.709 --> 21:38.417
I WOULD BE HURT, ANGRY,
DISGUSTED EVEN.

21:40.291 --> 21:43.583
- IS THAT HOW
YOU WANT ME TO FEEL?

21:43.583 --> 21:46.208
- NO.

21:46.208 --> 21:49.166
- WELL, GOOD.
SEE?

21:49.166 --> 21:52.834
EVERYTHING IS OKAY.

CHRISTINE HILL.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE.

TRINITY'S OUT THERE DOING

22:32.792 --> 22:35.041
EXACTLY WHAT I'M DOING
AT HIS HOUSE--

22:35.041 --> 22:36.083
PREPPING FOR A KILL.

22:36.083 --> 22:38.125
- ARTHUR'S DNA.

22:38.125 --> 22:40.709
- IF THE POLICE SEARCH
STAN BEAUDRY'S HOUSE

22:40.709 --> 22:41.917
AND FIND THOSE,

22:41.917 --> 22:44.000
THEY'LL THINK
HE'S THE TRINITY KILLER.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.750
- FOR A WHILE, ANYWAY.

22:46.750 --> 22:50.083
- LONG ENOUGH FOR ME
TO KILL THE REAL TRINITY.

22:50.083 --> 22:52.792
[cell phone rings]

22:52.792 --> 22:54.500
MORGAN.

22:54.500 --> 22:57.166
- DEXTER,
I NEED YOU AT THE STATION.

22:57.166 --> 22:58.792
- WOW. I, UM...

22:58.792 --> 23:00.834
KIND OF RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF DOING SOME STUFF.

23:00.834 --> 23:02.375
ANY CHANCE
MASUKA CAN COVER FOR ME?

23:02.375 --> 23:04.250
- NO CHANCE AT ALL.
BE HERE.

23:04.250 --> 23:05.291
- [sighs]

23:05.291 --> 23:08.542
SHIT.

23:08.542 --> 23:11.000
- YOU'RE JUGGLING
TOO MANY PEOPLE, DEXTER.

23:11.000 --> 23:15.000
- I KNOW--ARTHUR, BEAUDRY,

23:15.000 --> 23:18.083
RITA, NOW BATISTA...

23:18.083 --> 23:20.041
- I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THEM.

23:20.041 --> 23:21.792
I MEAN DEXTER MORGAN--

23:21.792 --> 23:25.041
BLOOD TECH, HUSBAND, FATHER,

23:25.041 --> 23:27.959
SERIAL KILLER, AND NOW
KYLE BUTLER, EXTORTIONIST?

23:27.959 --> 23:30.208
WHICH ONE ARE YOU?

23:30.208 --> 23:33.500
- ALL OF THEM.

23:37.333 --> 23:40.041
- YOU STILL PLAYING "WHO'S
YOUR DADDY?" WITH CHRISTINE?

23:40.041 --> 23:41.083
- I THOUGHT SHE'D COME CLEAN

23:41.083 --> 23:42.417
AFTER SPENDING
A NIGHT IN A CELL.

23:42.417 --> 23:43.417
NO SUCH LUCK.

23:43.417 --> 23:44.375
- TELL YOU WHAT.

23:44.375 --> 23:45.667
BEFORE HER LAWYER GETS HERE,

23:45.667 --> 23:47.875
LET ME TAKE A SHOT AT HER.

23:51.250 --> 23:55.083
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
WANT TO REFUEL.
