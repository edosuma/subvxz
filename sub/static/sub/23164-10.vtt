WEBVTT

00:04.046 --> 00:05.783
The Hanole prism is ours.

00:05.848 --> 00:07.684
The prism's no good
without the map.

00:07.749 --> 00:08.750
The map!

00:12.454 --> 00:14.457
Give it up, Higgins.

00:14.523 --> 00:16.293
The legend is well documented!

00:16.358 --> 00:19.129
We must find the lost art
by any means possible.

00:21.496 --> 00:23.499
Good God, man.
They'll obliterate us!

04:23.309 --> 04:28.152
A burial cave? He actually
sent me into a burial...

06:53.083 --> 06:54.386
This isn't it.

06:54.452 --> 06:57.658
What? It has to be!
I nearly got killed.

06:57.722 --> 07:00.159
For which I have already
expressed regret and explained

07:00.223 --> 07:03.395
that I had no idea the task would
prove to be so treacherous.

07:03.794 --> 07:05.964
Nevertheless, your misfortune
at the cave does not alter.

07:06.030 --> 07:07.070
J the fact that this scroll

07:07.130 --> 07:10.102
while doubtless the same age as
the lost art of the ancients,

07:10.233 --> 07:12.437
is a phony and
therefore worthless.

07:12.869 --> 07:16.108
I don't understand, and why
did I have to wear this hat?

07:17.239 --> 07:19.109
To keep the sun
out of your eyes.

07:19.976 --> 07:21.178
Even without the Hanole prism

07:21.243 --> 07:23.814
I can see that these particular
petroglyphs are meaningless.

07:23.879 --> 07:25.816
Visual gibberish, if you will.

07:25.981 --> 07:28.720
The Hanole prism?
Oh, right, of course.

07:28.851 --> 07:30.652
Well, there's nothing to
do but keep searching.

07:30.753 --> 07:34.560
Here, you'll want to wear this
once you get back on the trail.

07:34.623 --> 07:37.327
Oh, I don't think so, Higgins.

07:37.793 --> 07:40.297
I don't think there's any
trail to go back on.

07:40.628 --> 07:41.830
I beg your pardon?

07:41.896 --> 07:43.599
Oh, tell me, Higgins.

07:43.664 --> 07:47.405
Were any of those traps lethal
or were they all just illusions?

07:47.835 --> 07:51.542
Are you suggesting that I set up some
sort of elaborate practical joke?

07:51.606 --> 07:54.143
Oh, give it up, Higgins!

07:54.207 --> 07:56.110
You went too far
with the Hanole prism!

07:56.176 --> 07:58.079
You had your fun trying
to sell me on that story

07:58.145 --> 08:00.749
about pre-historic
little people geniuses.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.617
The legend is well documented!

08:08.989 --> 08:11.894
And the lost art scroll may
contain solutions to maladies

08:11.958 --> 08:13.828
that have plagued man
for centuries.

08:13.894 --> 08:16.598
Like practical iokes.
Goodbye, Higgins.

08:16.662 --> 08:19.567
May I remind you that Mr. Masters
is paying you quite handsomely

08:19.632 --> 08:21.302
for your assistance
in this venture?

08:21.367 --> 08:23.002
Was paying. And I'll
agree with you,

08:23.068 --> 08:24.938
you paid me handsomely,
Robin. Thanks.

08:25.004 --> 08:27.041
I won't even dignify that
with a response.

08:27.172 --> 08:29.276
Now, will you
or will you not help?

08:29.340 --> 08:32.546
I said no. N-O. No, no!

08:32.610 --> 08:35.414
No more traps, nO MOle
CaVeS, no more lost ark.

08:35.480 --> 08:37.317
Lart... Lost art!

08:37.414 --> 08:42.658
And either the joke is on me, Higgins, or
it's on you. But either way, count me out!

08:54.331 --> 08:58.271
How perceptive of him, Jonathan.
I do believe the joke is on you,

08:58.936 --> 09:00.839
for the moment, anyway.

09:01.404 --> 09:04.978
Oh, incidentally, that jacket
and hat were meant for you,

09:05.541 --> 09:07.611
not for your lackey.

09:08.244 --> 09:10.448
The great Peter Riddley-Smythe
can still elude

09:10.513 --> 09:13.619
even the most foolproof
security system, I see.

09:18.921 --> 09:21.225
That isn't the scroll you seek.

09:21.490 --> 09:23.026
I know that and you know that,

09:23.092 --> 09:25.729
but the people I'm selling
it to probably don't.

09:25.794 --> 09:27.164
Oh, by the way, Jonathan,

09:27.229 --> 09:30.435
please don't call your friend,
Magnum, when I leave.

09:30.499 --> 09:34.172
I should hate to have to
execute those two charming

09:34.235 --> 09:36.707
and drugged Dobermans of yours.

09:38.205 --> 09:39.640
Till the next time.

09:41.709 --> 09:43.746
And the ultimate prize.

09:49.216 --> 09:50.751
Robin's nest.

09:51.284 --> 09:55.091
Miss Northrup. Please,
I must see you tonight.

09:55.789 --> 09:57.759
I'm prepared to pay
whatever you ask.

10:00.293 --> 10:02.830
All night long.

10:02.896 --> 10:05.868
That lady in the blue gown
is taking everybody on.

10:05.965 --> 10:07.935
Four men left
only four men' left.

10:08.001 --> 10:10.673
And she's been dancing
with them all night long.

10:11.538 --> 10:13.073
That girl is dynamite!

10:13.539 --> 10:14.708
You'll know dynamite, all right,

10:14.774 --> 10:17.011
if Mr. Higgins finds out you're
staging another contest.

10:17.076 --> 10:18.711
How's he gonna know? Just relax.

10:22.115 --> 10:23.817
She's slowing down.

10:24.016 --> 10:25.786
Oh, no, no.

10:28.220 --> 10:30.223
This guy looks like
he might have taken her.

10:31.455 --> 10:32.991
Hold on.

10:33.524 --> 10:37.632
That hot ball of fire keeps on going.
Watch out, guys.

10:42.833 --> 10:45.204
Oh, another one bites the dust.

10:47.838 --> 10:50.275
Will it be the
lovely lady in blue?

10:54.344 --> 10:57.349
I know what you're thinking,
and this time you're wrong.

10:57.414 --> 11:01.154
This wasn't a dream or some kind
of bizarre fantasy of mine.

11:01.384 --> 11:04.990
No. It had all the earmarks
of the kind practical jokes

11:05.055 --> 11:08.862
played by the infamous double
agent Peter Riddley-Smythe.

11:09.491 --> 11:12.330
According to countless stories
Higgins had told me over the years,

11:12.394 --> 11:16.902
Peter Riddley-Smythe was an agent,
or actually a double agent,

11:16.966 --> 11:19.303
who was known for
concocting elaborate scenes

11:19.368 --> 11:22.574
out of his favorite movies
as part of every assignment.

11:22.638 --> 11:24.942
It was kind of like
his calling card.

11:25.640 --> 11:28.947
Of course, I had never believed
that there actually was such a man.

11:29.011 --> 11:30.213
I mean,
the whole thing sounded like

11:30.279 --> 11:33.150
a figment of Higgins'
rather active imagination.

11:35.416 --> 11:39.824
But, one way or the other, there was
obviously something wrong with Higgins

11:39.887 --> 11:43.493
and I had to make sure that
he wasn't in any real danger.

11:52.165 --> 11:54.202
That's it, he's had it.

11:55.368 --> 11:56.704
The lovely lady in blue.

11:56.770 --> 11:59.274
Let's have a big
hand for her. Yeah!

12:04.510 --> 12:06.080
Thanks for the ride. Sure.

12:12.384 --> 12:14.488
This one's on the house, sweetheart.
You deserve it.

12:14.587 --> 12:17.491
Oh. Now is that all I get for
winning the dance contest?

12:17.555 --> 12:19.893
Well, that remains to be seen.

12:20.226 --> 12:22.897
My name's Rick Wright.
I run this gin joint.

12:22.961 --> 12:23.962
What's your name?

12:24.029 --> 12:25.198
Miss Northrup?

12:25.864 --> 12:28.803
Higgins! What are you doing here?
I was just closing up now.

12:30.168 --> 12:32.138
You said you would
meet me out front.

12:33.071 --> 12:34.406
Well, I got bored.

12:34.471 --> 12:36.991
And I figured you would have sense
enough to look for me in here.

12:37.042 --> 12:40.348
I thought we agreed to
a quiet, private location.

12:44.081 --> 12:45.216
Do you mind?

12:47.885 --> 12:51.157
Instead, you meet me in here,
wearing a dress like that.

12:51.221 --> 12:53.024
Just get to the point,
will you, Mr. Higgins?

12:53.090 --> 12:54.725
An excellent suggestion.

12:54.791 --> 12:58.698
Let's do get to the point.
The prism?

13:02.699 --> 13:04.903
The club is closed, gentlemen.

13:04.967 --> 13:06.704
We are not thirsty.

13:07.502 --> 13:08.671
Where is it, Miss Northrup?

13:08.738 --> 13:11.075
If I have it,
I'm accepting bids.

13:11.140 --> 13:13.644
Oh, ours will be the
highest, I assure you.

13:13.709 --> 13:17.817
Please, it would be best if we
could have your cooperation.

13:17.879 --> 13:19.582
The Hanole prism,

13:19.648 --> 13:23.922
and your help in employing its
powers to locate the lost ark.

13:23.985 --> 13:25.020
Art. What?

13:25.087 --> 13:26.088
Art.

13:26.154 --> 13:29.895
The lost art of the ancients.
You said "the lost ark."

13:30.192 --> 13:32.496
A common mistake and I'm afraid
you've made another one.

13:32.560 --> 13:34.297
Miss Northrup does
not have the prism.

13:34.362 --> 13:36.499
Wait a minute.
You mean that she's a...

13:41.602 --> 13:43.004
Hey, hey, hey...

13:43.070 --> 13:44.539
Oh.

13:48.342 --> 13:51.715
Thank you. Your beautiful dress.

13:52.045 --> 13:53.948
How clumsy of me.

13:54.013 --> 13:56.350
Let me clean you off.

13:57.283 --> 13:58.318
Ah.

13:58.384 --> 14:00.554
Hi, guys. Hold it right there.

14:01.821 --> 14:03.323
No, see.

14:34.152 --> 14:35.622
Hi, Connie. Hello.

14:35.686 --> 14:37.021
Good to see you again.
Could I have a beer?

14:37.088 --> 14:38.623
Something with a long neck.

14:59.775 --> 15:02.045
I've been planning
to call you, honest.

15:02.111 --> 15:03.112
Thanks.

16:10.442 --> 16:12.312
I really appreciate this,
officers.

16:12.377 --> 16:14.414
I'm sorry for any inconvenience.

16:15.079 --> 16:17.584
So, Rick, you don't want to
press charges then, right?

16:17.648 --> 16:20.019
Oh, no, no. In fact, you can
assure whoever called in

16:20.084 --> 16:23.657
the disturbing-the-peace report
that everything is a-okay.

16:23.720 --> 16:28.463
I could promise you that the club will
definitely be closed for the evening.

16:29.426 --> 16:31.830
Thanks, officers. Good night.

16:34.565 --> 16:37.469
All right, Higgins.
What's going on?

16:37.534 --> 16:39.570
I don't have time
for lengthy explanations.

16:39.635 --> 16:42.407
We must find the lost art
by any means possible,

16:42.472 --> 16:44.142
and that's all I can tell you.

16:44.207 --> 16:45.976
Kenny. What are you doing?

16:46.042 --> 16:47.344
I'm calling the police back.

16:47.410 --> 16:49.814
No! You mustn't
involve the police.

16:49.878 --> 16:51.481
Kenny! All right!

16:53.916 --> 16:56.721
I was sworn to secrecy,
but I'll tell you everything.

16:56.785 --> 16:59.089
The lost art is not
just a whim of Mr. Masters.

16:59.154 --> 17:02.727
International agencies wish to
remain officially uninvolved,

17:02.790 --> 17:06.364
and Robin Masters provides them
with a perfect innocent collector.

17:06.428 --> 17:07.863
How accommodating of you.

17:09.130 --> 17:11.300
I have reason to believe that those
three men who were here tonight

17:11.365 --> 17:12.634
are foreign operatives.

17:12.700 --> 17:15.604
Working for the eccentric
Peter Riddley-Smythe?

17:15.702 --> 17:17.372
Double agent and cinema buff?

17:17.438 --> 17:19.441
This is no toking matter,
Magnum.

17:19.507 --> 17:22.346
We must find Miss Northrup
before they do.

17:23.076 --> 17:24.679
Kenny! All right,

17:25.546 --> 17:26.748
I lied.

17:27.247 --> 17:30.052
She does have the prism. It's the
key to translating the lost art.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.554
And if we don't get to her
before they do...

17:32.619 --> 17:33.755
You mean she could be...

17:37.123 --> 17:40.429
Okay, Higgins. I'll play along
with this little scenario.

17:40.493 --> 17:43.130
Long enough to find out
that Connie's okay.

17:43.195 --> 17:44.898
You know where she is? Maybe.

17:44.964 --> 17:47.501
I just have to make
one little stop first.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.634
I'm coming with you. If Miss
Northrup should return,

17:49.635 --> 17:51.739
keep her here until we get back.
Yeah, sure.

17:51.804 --> 17:53.173
How do you know Miss Northrup?

17:53.238 --> 17:54.740
It's a long story.

17:56.575 --> 17:57.877
You were engaged?

17:57.942 --> 17:59.879
No. Not exactly.

18:03.014 --> 18:05.418
More like engaged to be engaged.

18:05.483 --> 18:06.953
But that was a long time ago.

18:07.018 --> 18:10.858
And I'd appreciate it if you kept
that information between us.

18:12.956 --> 18:14.626
Well, the place
hasn't changed much.

18:14.691 --> 18:16.126
Extraordinary.

18:16.494 --> 18:18.664
There's a fortune
in rare antiquity here.

18:18.729 --> 18:21.668
But no Connie. I'm going to check
the rest of the house out.

18:23.233 --> 18:24.635
Hi. Ah!

18:25.602 --> 18:26.805
T.C.!

18:27.304 --> 18:28.706
Why didn't you say it was you?

18:28.771 --> 18:29.806
You found the prism?

18:29.872 --> 18:31.942
You didn't give me a chance.
Look at this.

18:32.008 --> 18:34.613
Why are you wearing that weird
hat and jacket? Insurance.

18:34.678 --> 18:36.715
I mean, if there really is a Peter
Riddley-Smythe... Extraordinary.

18:36.779 --> 18:38.281
How did you know to
come to this address?

18:38.347 --> 18:39.983
It was pretty simple, really.

18:40.049 --> 18:41.418
I saved this old article
that Connie Northrup

18:41.484 --> 18:44.891
had written for one of the archeological
magazines that I subscribe to.

18:44.954 --> 18:47.391
You subscribe
to archeology magazines?

18:47.523 --> 18:48.591
Yeah, well, a couple.

18:48.657 --> 18:53.299
Anyway, the article had her school address
in it, so I called posing as a buyer.

18:53.362 --> 18:56.166
And I got her home address.
I guess I got pretty lucky.

18:56.231 --> 18:57.266
Indeed.

18:57.332 --> 18:59.002
How did you get here?

18:59.067 --> 19:01.438
Well, apparently Magnum
and Miss Northrup...

19:01.503 --> 19:03.607
Are old friends. That's all.

19:04.572 --> 19:07.377
Well, I tried calling you at
the club, but no one answered.

19:07.442 --> 19:11.750
Higgins promised you a bundle
of money to find the lost art.

19:11.812 --> 19:14.149
I am not in it
for the money, T.M.

19:14.214 --> 19:16.351
I am trying to help
to find the lost art

19:16.417 --> 19:18.955
for purely humanitarian
and historical reasons.

19:19.019 --> 19:20.259
Wait a minute. What did you say?

19:20.287 --> 19:21.489
I said, I'm not in it
for the money...

19:21.555 --> 19:23.392
No. You said no one answered at the club.
Where's Rick?

19:23.457 --> 19:25.327
He was supposed to
wait for Miss Northrup.

19:25.392 --> 19:27.161
He'd have a long wait.

19:27.226 --> 19:28.227
Connie.

19:28.294 --> 19:30.331
Miss Northrup.
Miss Connie Northrup.

19:30.396 --> 19:32.768
Hand over the prism,
Mr. Higgins.

19:46.244 --> 19:48.381
An excellent suggestion.

19:50.048 --> 19:51.617
Do hand it over.

19:52.818 --> 19:54.821
In fact, I'll take it now.

19:57.255 --> 20:01.563
I would so have enjoyed taking
it from you, as usual, Jonathan.

20:01.660 --> 20:04.031
It isn't over yet,
Riddley-Smythe.

20:04.095 --> 20:05.498
Thank you.

20:07.832 --> 20:11.104
You must be
the lovely Nyoka Gordon.

20:12.269 --> 20:14.606
What are you saying?
My name is Connie Northrup.

20:14.672 --> 20:16.242
What is it this time, Peter?

20:16.307 --> 20:18.577
Maltese falcon?
Treasure of Sierra Madre?

20:18.642 --> 20:22.583
I'm sorry, Jonathan. I'm truly
sorry that you didn't get a chance

20:22.646 --> 20:24.348
to locate the lost ark.

20:24.414 --> 20:25.449
Art.

20:25.515 --> 20:27.753
Well, then.
Shall we go, Miss Northrup?

20:28.618 --> 20:33.361
I am sure you would not wish to witness
the execution of such wonderful friends.

20:34.424 --> 20:38.498
All right, everybody freeze!
That goes for you, too, fat man.

20:52.374 --> 20:53.676
Oh, my God.

20:53.742 --> 20:57.215
I can't believe you let the
Hanole prism slip from our grasp.

20:57.278 --> 20:59.215
Hey, Higgins. You're being a
little ungrateful, aren't you?

20:59.280 --> 21:01.484
I mean, if it weren't for
me showing up when I did,

21:01.549 --> 21:05.189
you'd be waiting in line right now waiting
for your harp and your little wings.

21:05.253 --> 21:06.922
How did you know
where to find us?

21:06.988 --> 21:09.269
Because I figured that Malcolm
lost two of his top shooters

21:09.290 --> 21:10.959
and he'd need some local talent.

21:11.091 --> 21:12.961
So I called Ice Pick,
got some names,

21:13.026 --> 21:15.063
did a little tailing
on my own, and got lucky.

21:15.128 --> 21:17.198
The police haven't been able to
get anything out of the gunmen.

21:17.264 --> 21:19.067
And Connie's
vanished into thin air.

21:19.132 --> 21:22.505
No doubt the tart has run off with
Malcolm to activate the prism.

21:22.836 --> 21:26.276
She's not a tart, Higgins, and you
could've saved us all a lot of grief

21:26.339 --> 21:28.309
by telling us what you were
up to from the beginning.

21:28.375 --> 21:30.211
I've told you before
about Riddley-Smythe.

21:30.276 --> 21:31.712
You never seemed to believe me.

21:31.778 --> 21:32.913
Who's Riddley-Smythe?

21:32.978 --> 21:35.082
Peter Riddley-Smythe,
a spy, a counter spy

21:35.147 --> 21:38.119
and a master thief who specializes
in stealing the exotic.

21:38.184 --> 21:40.555
Who's Malcolm? Malcolm
is an Eastern Bloc agent

21:40.619 --> 21:42.589
who is trying to steal
the prism for the other side.

21:42.655 --> 21:45.260
I am not worried about
Riddley-Smythe or Malcolm,

21:45.324 --> 21:46.325
I'm worried about Connie!

21:46.392 --> 21:47.473
Wait a minute. Who's Connie?

21:47.493 --> 21:50.231
I think I recognize this,
Higgins. North by Northwest.

21:50.328 --> 21:51.731
Wait a minute. Who's Connie?

21:51.797 --> 21:52.965
No, Bad Day at Black Rock.

21:53.031 --> 21:55.301
This isn't the time
to be playing movie trivia.

21:55.366 --> 21:57.470
We've got to figure out
where Miss Northrup is.

21:57.535 --> 22:01.309
That's exactly what I'm trying to do.
King Solomon's Mines,

22:01.372 --> 22:03.843
the Stewart Granger version,
not the Richard Chamberlain.

22:03.907 --> 22:05.347
Wait a minute.
Who's Connie Northrup?

22:05.410 --> 22:07.447
- Yes?
- It's Connie Northrup.

22:08.813 --> 22:10.448
I'm at your gate.

22:18.188 --> 22:20.358
I'm sure Thomas will
tell us what she said.

22:20.424 --> 22:23.262
Yeah, give the man
a little privacy.

22:24.761 --> 22:28.400
I can't believe she got her
hands on the prism and the map.

22:28.998 --> 22:31.569
I had to convince them
that I had to be alone

22:31.634 --> 22:34.573
with the prism and the map or
the incantations wouldn't work.

22:34.637 --> 22:35.638
They bought that?

22:35.705 --> 22:38.076
Well, Malcolm isn't exactly
a rocket scientist.

22:38.139 --> 22:39.509
But Riddley-Smythe.

22:39.575 --> 22:42.981
I had to make
certain romantic promises.

22:43.979 --> 22:45.147
Connie.

22:45.213 --> 22:47.383
Well, what did you
expect me to do?

22:48.083 --> 22:49.843
I couldn't count on
anyone else to rescue me.

22:49.885 --> 22:52.389
I would've rescued you.
You could've counted on me.

22:52.487 --> 22:55.124
Remember what happened the
last time I counted on you?

22:55.190 --> 22:56.792
I came home to a note!

22:56.858 --> 23:00.599
"Dear Connie, I'm very
sorry, but I have to leave."

23:01.061 --> 23:02.931
That's not what I said.

23:03.430 --> 23:04.800
What I said was,

23:05.199 --> 23:09.106
"Dear Connie, I'm very
sorry, but I have to leave."

23:10.237 --> 23:14.445
But, yeah, you're right, I should've
talked to you in person, I know.

23:14.508 --> 23:17.112
Or at least called,
and I've been meaning to.

23:17.176 --> 23:18.211
For seven years?

23:18.278 --> 23:20.850
Yes! I even drove by your
house a couple of times,

23:20.914 --> 23:22.917
but I didn't see your car.

23:26.219 --> 23:27.220
L...

23:28.221 --> 23:31.760
I just guess
I didn't know what to say,

23:32.157 --> 23:33.760
except that I made a mistake.

23:38.230 --> 23:40.802
And I'm sorry.

23:44.503 --> 23:46.139
Do you mean that?

23:47.139 --> 23:49.710
Yes. Yes, I do.

23:59.450 --> 24:03.424
Are you doing this again so you
can hit me on the head with that?

24:30.145 --> 24:31.781
Oh, Connie.

24:32.147 --> 24:33.549
I know.

24:34.884 --> 24:38.590
I know, as usual
our timing is awful.

24:41.122 --> 24:43.494
I mean,
how can we get reacquainted

24:43.559 --> 24:45.896
when people are
trying to kill me?

24:46.795 --> 24:49.299
Thomas, this is all my fault.

24:49.364 --> 24:53.905
I should never have written those
articles on the lost art of the ancients.

24:54.335 --> 24:55.537
It was just
another pretty legend

24:55.603 --> 24:58.308
until I started publishing
those articles about it.

24:58.373 --> 25:01.612
Now everybody wants it,
and nobody should have it.

25:02.677 --> 25:03.845
Why?

25:07.581 --> 25:12.257
With the prism, I can translate
the writings on the scroll.

25:12.786 --> 25:15.324
But what if the writings
turn out to be evil?

25:15.389 --> 25:17.760
Look, Connie, if you
really believe that,

25:17.824 --> 25:20.963
it's better that Higgins finds
it, than those other guys.

25:23.095 --> 25:24.397
Trust me.

25:25.866 --> 25:27.268
I want to.

25:35.206 --> 25:37.711
The map! The map!

25:41.013 --> 25:42.014
The map!

25:45.150 --> 25:46.151
Stay here.

25:48.686 --> 25:49.687
Higgins.

25:54.426 --> 25:55.426
Thomas!

25:59.530 --> 26:01.835
No need to worry
about him, my dear.

26:07.304 --> 26:08.305
Higgins.

26:10.808 --> 26:12.110
You all right?

26:13.911 --> 26:15.413
Rick's calling an ambulance.

26:22.652 --> 26:23.987
Where's the map?

26:28.825 --> 26:29.826
Connie!

26:38.800 --> 26:39.801
Connie...

26:43.129 --> 26:44.431
No sign of survivors?

26:44.722 --> 26:46.459
No sign of anything.

26:46.657 --> 26:47.925
I checked the whole area.

26:47.992 --> 26:50.363
That means that Connie,
Miss Northrup, is dead.

26:50.426 --> 26:53.665
I knew it! This is great.

26:56.033 --> 26:58.170
Shock, shock. He's trying
to hide his feelings.

26:58.234 --> 27:00.871
Now how am I supposed
to find the lost art?

27:00.937 --> 27:03.342
What are you, crazy? You're
worried about a stupid scroll

27:03.406 --> 27:05.008
when people are
croaking around us?

27:05.074 --> 27:07.545
But they're not. They're not!

27:09.012 --> 27:11.316
You trying to tell me you
didn't see a boat explode?

27:11.380 --> 27:13.083
Oh, I saw the boat, all right.

27:13.149 --> 27:14.985
And I thought Connie was on it.

27:15.051 --> 27:17.855
That's exactly what Riddley-Smythe
wanted me to think.

27:17.920 --> 27:23.163
But she wasn't. See, she jumped out of the
chariot before it went over the cliff.

27:23.357 --> 27:25.060
What chariot? What cliff?

27:25.127 --> 27:26.997
Oh, don't you remember?

27:27.062 --> 27:29.934
Nyoka and the Lost
Secrets of Hippocrates.

27:30.264 --> 27:32.568
She went over a cliff
in a chariot

27:32.633 --> 27:35.004
and at the last moment
she bailed out.

27:35.570 --> 27:37.874
Of course, everybody in Miss
Primmark's fourth-grade class

27:37.939 --> 27:40.744
thought she was dead until
the next Saturday when...

27:42.143 --> 27:44.146
it's too hard to explain,

27:44.511 --> 27:48.185
but that's exactly the kind of movie
that Riddley-Smythe would try and copy.

27:48.249 --> 27:53.124
He wants us to think that Connie is
dead, so we'll stop looking for her.

27:53.787 --> 27:55.222
Which we're not going to do.

27:55.287 --> 27:56.490
Exactly!

28:01.995 --> 28:04.699
This is the craziest
long shot you've ever played.

28:04.763 --> 28:07.768
This terrain doesn't even
remotely resemble the terrain

28:07.833 --> 28:10.605
in Nyoka and the Lost Secrets
of Hippocrates.

28:10.669 --> 28:14.075
Use your imagination, Higgins.
There are some similarities.

28:16.175 --> 28:17.210
T.C.

28:19.979 --> 28:21.281
The camp.

28:24.149 --> 28:25.718
You were right.

28:28.019 --> 28:30.391
Here, you may need this.

28:32.991 --> 28:34.126
I've got the whip.

30:13.685 --> 30:16.590
I've waited
a long time for this.

30:18.123 --> 30:19.659
You little minx!

30:31.369 --> 30:32.537
Riddley-Smythe?

30:34.105 --> 30:35.307
Magnum?

30:43.180 --> 30:45.450
You okay? This is going
to hurt a little bit.

30:45.515 --> 30:47.952
I thought I was a goner! How did
you figure out where we were?

30:48.017 --> 30:51.391
Easy. Riddley-Smythe left
one calling card too many.

30:51.454 --> 30:52.455
What?

30:52.522 --> 30:54.993
Well, see, he sets up
these elaborate movie...

30:55.125 --> 30:56.260
Never mind that.
Let's get out of here.

30:56.326 --> 30:57.361
What about the prism?

30:57.427 --> 30:59.564
Will you forget the prism?
Thomas,

30:59.628 --> 31:02.133
can't you see now how
dangerous the lost art is?

31:03.166 --> 31:07.006
If we don't find it ourselves and destroy
it, then someone else will find it

31:07.069 --> 31:09.574
and use it for
who knows what evil plan?

31:09.805 --> 31:12.242
If not Riddley-Smythe,
then someone like him.

31:12.641 --> 31:15.345
Could you live with yourself knowing
that you saved your own neck

31:15.410 --> 31:17.480
but put all of mankind at risk?

31:17.545 --> 31:19.148
Yes, I think I could.

31:20.982 --> 31:22.117
T.C.! We have to
get out of here.

31:22.184 --> 31:24.020
Higgins has got the whole
camp in an uproar.

31:24.085 --> 31:26.255
Magnum, I've got it.

31:26.921 --> 31:28.456
The Hanole prism is ours.

31:28.523 --> 31:29.625
What about the map?

31:29.690 --> 31:31.459
The prism's no good
without the map.

31:33.027 --> 31:34.462
Where's Rick?

31:35.129 --> 31:36.999
There was a slight altercation.

31:37.064 --> 31:39.435
He was covering me
while I liberated the prism.

31:39.966 --> 31:41.402
Where's Rick?

31:47.874 --> 31:50.645
I wouldn't want to be you
when they cut these ropes.

31:56.782 --> 31:58.285
The truck. Get in.

32:02.489 --> 32:03.557
Can I hold that for you?

32:03.622 --> 32:04.824
Get in!

32:05.457 --> 32:06.458
Hey!

32:18.002 --> 32:19.337
It worked before.

32:22.841 --> 32:24.043
Get the machine gun.

32:29.447 --> 32:32.219
Hey! This is what the world
has to look forward to.

32:32.283 --> 32:34.954
They'll never stop
coming after the lost art.

32:35.619 --> 32:37.455
I guess you haven't
changed after all.

32:37.522 --> 32:40.728
You're not the crusader, Thomas
Magnum, I knew seven years ago.

32:46.562 --> 32:48.365
They're escaping!

32:49.065 --> 32:50.835
Get him, T.C.!

32:55.271 --> 32:56.874
Get the bullets.

32:57.840 --> 32:59.409
They're getting a machine gun.

32:59.475 --> 33:01.545
They never had
any of this in Nyoka.

33:02.278 --> 33:04.048
The choice is up to you.

33:04.380 --> 33:05.815
Ow! Sorry.

33:10.619 --> 33:12.789
I must've thought
of the wrong movie.

33:13.455 --> 33:16.027
- Good God, man.
- They'll obliterate us!

33:30.604 --> 33:32.808
Nice going, guys. I'll meet
you at the helicopter.

33:32.873 --> 33:33.975
Hang on, man.

33:41.515 --> 33:44.219
Can you get us back to the
chopper through this mess?

33:44.285 --> 33:47.289
Yes, just as soon as
we find the lost art.

33:50.823 --> 33:54.462
I knew it! Oh, I knew
you would come through!

33:54.527 --> 33:56.898
I knew you wouldn't
let the whole world down!

34:02.200 --> 34:05.574
This is the cave I sent you to
in the first place. I know.

34:05.637 --> 34:07.907
But this is where you got
the wrong scroll before.

34:07.973 --> 34:09.842
What makes you think
the right one is here?

34:09.908 --> 34:12.579
The movie. You've thought
of the right movie.

34:12.643 --> 34:14.112
What? No.

34:14.179 --> 34:16.216
This doesn't have anything to
do with any movie, Higgins.

34:16.281 --> 34:18.150
I just got to thinking
maybe the wrong scroll

34:18.215 --> 34:20.520
was just a decoy, protecting
the right scroll.

34:20.585 --> 34:22.387
Besides, Higgins,
if your research led you

34:22.453 --> 34:26.060
to believe this was the right cave,
you're usually not completely wrong.

34:26.123 --> 34:27.391
Thank you.

34:27.591 --> 34:30.429
But how did you figure out
where the new entrance was?

34:30.494 --> 34:32.197
Simple mathematical
calculation based on

34:32.263 --> 34:34.867
the angle of the falling debris
when I was inside the cave.

34:48.677 --> 34:50.414
Raiders of Ghost City?

34:50.480 --> 34:53.150
No, that's too western.

34:53.716 --> 34:56.120
Besides, there are
no trains in Hawaii.

35:01.256 --> 35:02.625
Oh, my God.

35:04.226 --> 35:05.227
Oh, my God.

35:06.728 --> 35:08.832
Oh, my God.

35:37.657 --> 35:40.562
That's it. We've found it!

35:41.927 --> 35:43.230
The ark...

35:43.296 --> 35:44.364
Art.

35:44.431 --> 35:47.035
Don't you mean art,
Higgins? The lost art?

35:47.166 --> 35:50.405
Of course, I do. The
lost art is in the ark.

35:50.469 --> 35:53.776
According to the legend.
Come on!

36:01.112 --> 36:02.113
Connie!

36:02.448 --> 36:04.819
I'm counting on you, Thomas!

36:19.497 --> 36:23.671
This is it, Thomas,
the lost art of the ancients.

36:25.936 --> 36:28.908
The prism will turn the
petroglyphs into English.

36:28.972 --> 36:30.441
Do you hear something?

36:34.078 --> 36:35.613
Here it comes, Mr. Higgins.

36:42.151 --> 36:43.754
Thank you, Miss Northrup.

36:47.256 --> 36:51.697
Thank you both so much for acting
out your part so faithfully.

36:52.295 --> 36:54.365
I wouldn't have gone
down into that pit,

36:55.097 --> 36:56.967
considering what's down there.

36:59.569 --> 37:04.411
But I knew that Jonathan could be counted
on to find somebody gullible enough.

37:05.440 --> 37:07.811
Well, I suppose this is adieu.

37:08.443 --> 37:12.417
By the time you've sorted out
this movie, you'll both be dead.

37:21.122 --> 37:22.390
Thomas.

37:23.124 --> 37:28.133
Before we die, truth. Are you sorry
now that we didn't get married?

37:28.762 --> 37:30.599
Take off your skirt.

37:30.664 --> 37:33.201
This is hardly
the time or the place.

37:33.266 --> 37:36.138
I need some cloth for a torch.

37:37.237 --> 37:40.209
I have to find out what
that hissing sound is.

37:40.540 --> 37:44.447
It can't be snakes. There's
no snakes in Hawaii.

37:44.843 --> 37:47.381
Even Riddley-Smythe
couldn't arrange that.

37:48.481 --> 37:52.087
But I still want to find
out what that sound is.

37:55.822 --> 37:57.057
Snakes.

38:21.010 --> 38:24.917
Connie, please,
you're not helping.

38:24.980 --> 38:27.284
Well, neither are you!
Just do something!

38:31.453 --> 38:32.823
Take off your clothes.

38:32.888 --> 38:34.824
Thomas, I have feelings
for you, too... Connie.

38:34.890 --> 38:37.928
But this is just not the
time or the place... Connie.

38:38.327 --> 38:40.731
Whatever you can do without.
We need more torches.

38:40.895 --> 38:42.531
Why don't you take off
some of your clothes?

38:42.598 --> 38:44.000
Because I saw the movie.

38:44.065 --> 38:46.402
Which movie? That's not
important right now.

38:48.069 --> 38:50.640
The Perils of Pauline?

38:50.705 --> 38:52.508
That's it. I'm turning back.

38:52.941 --> 38:54.343
No, no. We can't give up.

38:54.742 --> 38:58.516
After Thomas just drove off and left us
with those maniacs with machine guns?

38:58.580 --> 39:01.221
You give me one good reason why I
should go back to try to find him.

39:01.248 --> 39:03.553
The lost art.
We're not rescuing Thomas.

39:03.618 --> 39:05.520
We're rescuing the lost art

39:05.586 --> 39:07.089
for posterity.

39:08.088 --> 39:09.723
T.C., look! The truck!

39:10.891 --> 39:13.630
- Don't worry, Thomas!
- We'll save you.

39:13.727 --> 39:15.162
Help's on the way!

39:17.297 --> 39:18.699
There's gotta be
a way out of here.

39:18.765 --> 39:20.400
There was in the movie,
there's gotta be one here.

39:20.466 --> 39:23.673
Well, you better hurry up and find it.
I'm running out of clothes.

39:37.617 --> 39:38.618
That's it!

39:39.919 --> 39:41.856
I don't know why
I didn't see it before!

39:41.921 --> 39:43.089
No!

39:43.154 --> 39:45.057
Connie, we're out of here.

39:45.690 --> 39:49.931
All we got to do is
push this giant facade,

39:49.994 --> 39:53.100
a block will fall away, and we'll
climb our way out of here.

39:53.163 --> 39:54.966
Well, then, push it,
for heaven's sake.

39:55.032 --> 39:57.236
I am pushing.

40:09.580 --> 40:11.382
I don't know how to
tell you this, Connie.

40:11.448 --> 40:13.184
But I think we're going to die.

40:14.984 --> 40:17.421
I just wanted you to know that

40:17.487 --> 40:19.591
I've thought a lot about you
over the last seven years

40:19.656 --> 40:22.428
and just because I never
called doesn't mean...

40:53.855 --> 40:55.224
Let's get out of here.

40:56.424 --> 40:58.327
Verify the lost ark.

40:58.459 --> 40:59.828
Art.

40:59.894 --> 41:01.964
And I'll see you
in Hades, first.

41:02.630 --> 41:04.900
You already have the scroll.

41:04.965 --> 41:07.102
Why don't we just
terminate him and leave?

41:09.536 --> 41:12.341
I have to be sure that
the scroll is authentic.

41:13.039 --> 41:14.708
Do you know what my comrades...

41:16.609 --> 41:20.917
Colleagues would do to me if I
brought them the wrong art?

41:26.953 --> 41:28.422
Verify it.

41:32.791 --> 41:33.826
Verify it.

41:33.892 --> 41:35.060
Never!

41:36.127 --> 41:37.930
Oh, go ahead, Higgins.

41:41.499 --> 41:42.835
Verify it.

41:43.301 --> 41:44.603
Magnum.

41:44.669 --> 41:46.472
It won't do you
any good, anyway.

41:47.372 --> 41:48.607
Kill him!

41:50.174 --> 41:53.045
If they shoot me, I shoot you.

42:08.558 --> 42:09.559
Hold it!

42:31.747 --> 42:34.819
Hey, you! Come back
with that scroll!

42:43.258 --> 42:44.893
I'll take that.

42:47.962 --> 42:49.230
Never.

42:50.064 --> 42:51.199
It's mine!

42:57.304 --> 42:58.305
Thomas!

43:02.075 --> 43:05.047
I thought I told you to wait
until I came back for you.

43:05.112 --> 43:08.886
The last time you told me I'll be
right back I had to wait seven years.

43:08.949 --> 43:12.322
I didn't say I'd be right
back, I said I'll call you.

43:12.385 --> 43:15.424
And I meant to. I just
lost track of time.

43:15.488 --> 43:17.925
Right and you drove by the
house a couple of times.

43:17.990 --> 43:20.228
Well, Thomas, it's
just not good enough.

43:27.165 --> 43:28.534
Oh, Connie.

43:28.600 --> 43:30.203
Riddley-Smythe is...

43:33.205 --> 43:35.442
Well, do something! I...

43:42.581 --> 43:46.521
He who fights and runs away,
lives to fight another day.

43:46.852 --> 43:49.223
I have a canoe. Adieu!

44:12.876 --> 44:16.249
Done in by his own
elaborate scheme.

44:16.713 --> 44:18.449
Somebody should have told him.

44:18.514 --> 44:21.787
In the movies the
good guys always win.

44:38.232 --> 44:40.135
Thomas, I'm going to
be late for my plane

44:40.202 --> 44:44.677
and will not miss my worldwide
lecture tour on the lost art.

44:44.739 --> 44:46.976
What are you going to tell people
about the scroll? It's a myth.

44:47.041 --> 44:48.611
And so is the legendary
Peter Riddley-Smythe.

44:48.676 --> 44:50.946
Wait a minute. Wait. This is it.
This is the good part.

44:51.112 --> 44:53.584
This is where Riddley-Smythe
got the idea.

44:53.648 --> 44:56.486
Thomas, I am very sorry,
but I have to leave.

44:57.785 --> 44:58.920
Connie! Wait a minute.

44:59.553 --> 45:03.327
Wait a minute. Connie, I'm sorry. Come
on, I just got a little carried away.

45:03.390 --> 45:07.263
No, I'm sorry I just
kind of got carried away.

45:07.327 --> 45:09.327
And after seven years is
that all you can say to me,

45:09.395 --> 45:11.465
"Thomas, I'm very sorry,
but I have to leave"?

45:11.530 --> 45:12.966
It's not what I said.

45:13.033 --> 45:17.040
I said, "Thomas I'm very
sorry, but I have to leave."

45:18.270 --> 45:19.672
Do you mean that?

45:20.873 --> 45:22.141
Yes, I do.

45:22.675 --> 45:23.676
Kww.

45:24.777 --> 45:25.778
Connie.

45:30.348 --> 45:32.518
Magnum, I just realized

45:32.584 --> 45:34.487
how we can get back into cave.
Cave?

45:34.552 --> 45:36.055
To get the lost art. Art?

45:36.121 --> 45:37.690
Goodbye, Thomas. Connie.

45:37.789 --> 45:40.628
Here, put these on and come with me.
I have a plan.

45:47.165 --> 45:48.166
Magnum?

45:51.301 --> 45:52.436
Magnum?

45:55.672 --> 45:56.673
Magnum!

45:57.241 --> 45:59.110
Open this door immediately!

46:00.343 --> 46:01.546
Magnum!

46:03.013 --> 46:04.215
Magnum!
