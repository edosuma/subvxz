00:56.597 --> 01:00.134
Good morning, good
morning, how we doing?

01:01.268 --> 01:03.103
Let's turn our
books to page 394.

01:03.137 --> 01:06.373
So this is the equation we're
dealing with today, all right.

01:06.406 --> 01:09.109
So I want you to listen up,
this is not an easy one.

01:09.143 --> 01:10.344
Yeah, Megan?

01:10.378 --> 01:11.646
May I
use the restroom?

01:11.679 --> 01:13.414
Yeah, make it quick.

01:13.447 --> 01:15.216
All right, quiet down.

01:15.248 --> 01:18.218
394, so interpreting
a velocity function.

01:18.251 --> 01:21.588
Hey guys quiet, 390,
can you turn around

01:22.822 --> 01:25.025
and open your book
please, thank you.

01:26.192 --> 01:27.361
Yes.

01:27.394 --> 01:28.862
Boys, slow down!

01:28.896 --> 01:30.899
Hey Sam will you close that up
and get to class, thank you!

03:12.032 --> 03:13.635
What was that!

03:26.146 --> 03:29.516
♪ I know I'm out of my mind ♪

03:29.550 --> 03:33.454

03:40.527 --> 03:44.431
Hello everybody good
morning, it's Jenna Ross here.

03:44.465 --> 03:46.334
If you've been following
my blog thank you.

03:46.366 --> 03:48.468
I'm up to 10,000 followers.

03:48.502 --> 03:50.471
I appreciate you and
your comments so much

03:50.503 --> 03:52.239
and if you're a new fan, hi.

03:52.272 --> 03:53.807
It's nice to meet you.

03:53.841 --> 03:56.978
I'm 18 and I'm a
freshman in college.

03:57.010 --> 04:00.847
This is my dorm room
where the magic happens,

04:00.881 --> 04:02.817
by magic I mean homework.

04:02.849 --> 04:04.951
Okay guess which side
is mine you guys?

04:04.985 --> 04:07.555
I'm a neat freak
for the new fans.

04:13.294 --> 04:14.762
So today we're not gonna
talk about the usual stuff

04:14.794 --> 04:16.863
that we talk about which
is politics, gun control,

04:16.896 --> 04:19.867
the environment, instead we're
gonna talk about something

04:19.899 --> 04:22.067
that hurts my heart very much.

04:22.101 --> 04:24.538
Three nights ago a 14-year-old
from my high school

04:24.572 --> 04:26.406
took his own life.

04:26.439 --> 04:27.942
He was a freshmen.

04:27.975 --> 04:30.945
In just the last two days
I have seen two teenagers

04:30.978 --> 04:33.915
commit suicide live
on social media.

04:33.947 --> 04:36.883
This is just heartbreaking
and I couldn't even watch it.

04:36.916 --> 04:40.220
It's horrible to hear about
people taking their own lives,

04:40.254 --> 04:42.123
especially teenagers.

04:42.156 --> 04:44.257
I'm making these videos
today to raise awareness

04:44.290 --> 04:45.793
in this country.

04:45.826 --> 04:48.162
Kids aren't just committing
suicide because they're gay

04:48.194 --> 04:49.663
or because they're bullied.

04:49.697 --> 04:53.000
There are other things too but
nobody's talking about them.

04:53.033 --> 04:54.468
So I'm gonna.

04:55.903 --> 04:58.406
It's the pressure from the
parents and the school.

04:58.439 --> 05:00.040
The amount of stress that
a student goes through

05:00.074 --> 05:02.009
in this country is ridiculous.

05:02.041 --> 05:03.510
Do you know how
much pressure it is

05:03.543 --> 05:05.712
to get into a good college now?

05:05.745 --> 05:09.649
I had to maintain good
grades, no, not good grades,

05:09.682 --> 05:11.685
perfect grades.

05:11.718 --> 05:13.887
It just shouldn't take
kids committing suicide

05:13.920 --> 05:16.858
for the stress levels and
homework levels to go down.

05:18.024 --> 05:19.826
We need to spread
awareness you guys

05:19.860 --> 05:21.295
and get this message out.

05:21.327 --> 05:23.663
Share it with your
friends, your family,

05:23.697 --> 05:25.833
post this video on Facebook.

05:25.865 --> 05:28.802
Click like and write
your comments below.

05:28.836 --> 05:31.105
We can't lose anymore
teens to something

05:31.137 --> 05:33.608
that is so easily preventable.

05:34.574 --> 05:36.009
All right guys so keep watching,

05:36.043 --> 05:37.545
I'll be posting all day but I'm
changing it up a little bit.

05:37.577 --> 05:39.613
I'm doing something
I've never done before.

05:39.646 --> 05:43.084
No edits, no cutting,
just real Jenna.

05:43.117 --> 05:46.187
Thank you for listening,
I'm Jenna Ross,

05:46.220 --> 05:48.223
have a beautiful day.

05:49.490 --> 05:51.859
Oh please don't
forget to comment.

05:53.026 --> 05:55.430
I love hearing from
all of you, okay.

05:56.697 --> 05:57.531
Bye guys.

05:59.867 --> 06:03.137
Hello everyone, I'm
Nick Meyer, I'm 17

06:04.504 --> 06:06.740
and this is my first video.

06:09.576 --> 06:12.980
So today's my second
week in my new school.

06:14.447 --> 06:16.283
It's an all boys school.

06:18.351 --> 06:20.687
Which is way different
than my other school.

06:22.355 --> 06:24.024
I'm a little nervous
to be honest.

06:25.959 --> 06:28.562
But today is a great
day because my parents

06:28.595 --> 06:30.898
finally came around and they
gave me back my cellphone

06:30.930 --> 06:33.467
which allows me back
on social media.

06:34.634 --> 06:35.870
I've been grounded
from all that stuff

06:35.903 --> 06:39.140
for like a month now.

06:39.173 --> 06:42.377
It's been really hard not
being on social media.

06:43.810 --> 06:46.447
It was like the loneliest
time of my life actually

06:46.480 --> 06:48.816
because I look to that
stuff for support, you know?

06:49.783 --> 06:50.685
What's up freak?

06:50.718 --> 06:52.186
What the fuck you got there man.

06:52.218 --> 06:53.553
Okay, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, please, please.

06:55.021 --> 06:56.790
Jesus we have a stream
here. You got a lot of viewers

06:56.824 --> 06:58.526
What's up faggots?

06:58.559 --> 07:00.528
Hi, how you fucking doing?

07:00.560 --> 07:02.796
- You wanna play with this?
- What you got going on here?

07:02.829 --> 07:04.531
These are all your
faggot ass friends

07:04.564 --> 07:06.500
who is watching your videos,
is that what's going on?

07:06.533 --> 07:07.968
Say hi.

07:08.000 --> 07:08.902
Hey guys, let's get a
little selfie going on huh?

07:08.935 --> 07:09.936
Come on you guys please.

07:09.970 --> 07:11.439
You know I like you two, huh?

07:11.471 --> 07:13.274
- Let's see what's going on.
- I like it it's a good thing.

07:13.307 --> 07:14.742
Let's see what's going on.

07:14.774 --> 07:15.975
You think it's
gonna hurt worse

07:16.009 --> 07:17.311
- when I shatter you jaw
- Straighten his tie up

07:17.343 --> 07:19.012
or the therapy afterwards?
a little bit.

07:22.216 --> 07:24.085
What you got
something to say, huh?

07:25.786 --> 07:27.088
There we go.

07:27.120 --> 07:29.022
You're fucking
dead after school.

07:30.357 --> 07:33.427
And I hope all you
guys get to watch.

07:35.461 --> 07:37.564
- Let's get out of here.
- See you.

07:39.399 --> 07:41.368
Hey guys it's Jenna
Ross here again.

07:41.401 --> 07:43.103
I just read all of your comments

07:43.137 --> 07:45.939
and I'm really sorry if
I offended some of you,

07:45.973 --> 07:49.076
that was not my intention.

07:49.108 --> 07:51.077
I hear what you guys are saying
about the bullying issue,

07:51.110 --> 07:54.814
trust me I do, I saw it
high school everyday.

07:54.848 --> 07:58.252
I see it on campus, I see
it online, it's disgusting

07:58.285 --> 08:01.655
and I do everything in
my power to stop it.

08:01.687 --> 08:03.757
All I'm saying is that
there are teenagers

08:03.790 --> 08:06.493
that are committing suicide
that are not being bullied,

08:06.526 --> 08:07.461
that's all.

08:09.096 --> 08:11.598
Did you know that suicide
is the third leading cause

08:11.632 --> 08:13.867
of death in all teenagers?

08:13.901 --> 08:15.668
Did you also know that according

08:15.701 --> 08:17.237
to the American
Psychiatric Association,

08:17.271 --> 08:20.174
almost all teenagers
who are depressed

08:20.206 --> 08:22.776
will attempt suicide
at some time.

08:22.810 --> 08:24.911
I'm gonna list you a
few of the warning signs

08:24.944 --> 08:26.980
you might see from
somebody who's in danger

08:27.014 --> 08:28.983
of committing suicide.

08:29.016 --> 08:32.352
One is talking
frequently about death.

08:32.385 --> 08:34.788
Two, is writing
depressed poetry.

08:34.822 --> 08:37.957
Three is acting out or
changes in their behavior

08:37.990 --> 08:41.193
like partying or doing drugs
when they never have before.

08:42.729 --> 08:45.166
We can't lose anymore
teens to this you guys.

08:45.198 --> 08:48.935
We can end this suicide
craze, I know we can.

08:51.071 --> 08:53.240
Okay, thank you, love you.

08:55.107 --> 08:55.942
Bye.

09:16.163 --> 09:17.597

blowing up right now.

10:50.823 --> 10:53.293
He has like 200,000 followers.

10:55.461 --> 10:57.230
He's kind of a big deal.

10:58.999 --> 11:02.003
But Brandon doesn't care
about any of that shit.

11:03.302 --> 11:05.706
He'd do this everyday
with no followers.

11:09.308 --> 11:11.077
Nothing would stop him.

11:11.110 --> 11:14.514
- James, breakfast is ready!
- Be right down!

11:14.548 --> 11:15.749
- Fuck, Mom,.
- Geeze, I'm sorry

11:15.782 --> 11:17.518
- I didn't know.
- Yeah, well

11:17.551 --> 11:18.953
now I have to do it all over
again, thank you very much.

11:18.985 --> 11:20.187
Well you
should have told me.

11:20.220 --> 11:20.854
All
right, I'm sorry.

11:20.886 --> 11:22.355
Geeze.

11:22.389 --> 11:25.158
This used to happen every
single day when he lived here.

11:25.192 --> 11:26.360
Are you smoking pot?

11:26.393 --> 11:27.894
No I'm
not at all, no.

11:27.927 --> 11:29.730
Brandon, it's 10
a.m., this is what you do

11:29.763 --> 11:32.333
- in L.A. all day?
- No it's not.

11:32.365 --> 11:33.199
God.

11:36.068 --> 11:38.705
Hi everyone, Nick
Meyer here again.

11:39.873 --> 11:43.043
It's lunchtime and
this is pretty much

11:43.076 --> 11:44.579
where I spend all my lunches.

11:48.248 --> 11:51.986
If you think this is bad, gym
class is way worse.

11:52.019 --> 11:53.553
There's no hiding there.

11:57.323 --> 11:58.825
This is worst school yet.

12:00.126 --> 12:02.362
It's really small
only like 100 boys,

12:03.697 --> 12:06.333
so everyone knows
everyone.

12:17.476 --> 12:20.146
Sorry, I don't really
know what to say.

12:23.549 --> 12:27.420
I guess I can start with
why I'm making these videos.

12:31.658 --> 12:34.394
So, when I was a
little boy, my...

12:35.528 --> 12:39.566
- I took the photo.
- Hey this one's broken.

12:40.833 --> 12:42.568
- Yo is someone in there?
- Yeah.

12:42.601 --> 12:44.038
Well, fucking hurry
up, I gotta take a shit

12:44.071 --> 12:45.806
and the other stall's broken.

12:45.839 --> 12:47.141
Sorry, it's gonna be awhile.

12:47.173 --> 12:49.375
- Oh fuck.
- Who's in there?

12:49.408 --> 12:51.345
- Nick.
- Nick Costello

12:51.378 --> 12:54.081
- or Nick the new kid?
- Nick the new kid.

12:54.114 --> 12:56.684
- Oh this guy.
- You're fucking dead faggot!

12:57.951 --> 12:58.952
You're fucking dead!

13:00.120 --> 13:01.221
Now he's all
pissed off at me.

13:01.254 --> 13:04.191
Well he'll get over it.

13:04.224 --> 13:05.592
I'll eat his breakfast.

13:08.294 --> 13:12.399
Hey, no I can't
today, I gotta go, bye.

13:21.374 --> 13:25.045
Good morning, handsome,
oh god are you filming me?

13:25.077 --> 13:28.448
My sons love to film me
before I have any makeup on.

13:28.481 --> 13:30.016
You look
beautiful Mom.

13:30.049 --> 13:32.719
I pay
him to say that.

13:32.753 --> 13:34.955
- What's up big guy?
- Good morning world.

13:34.988 --> 13:39.159
You got a little, what's
wrong, is there a problem?

13:39.192 --> 13:41.562
Listen all right, you
put your camera down,

13:41.595 --> 13:44.465
I'll put my phone down
and let's eat, mister...

13:44.498 --> 13:46.266
Sure you don't want
any of my berries?

13:46.298 --> 13:47.433
- No, no.
- Here, here.

13:47.466 --> 13:48.802
- No, no.
- Here.

13:51.538 --> 13:52.706
So, we're gonna leave
in about an hour

13:52.739 --> 13:56.677
and we left you guys
some cash in the drawer

13:56.710 --> 13:58.177
and we'll be back Sunday night.

13:58.211 --> 14:01.447
No big parties, mister popular.

14:01.480 --> 14:03.317
- No parties!
- I know.

14:05.018 --> 14:07.354
Okay, well you can have
one or two friends over

14:07.386 --> 14:08.821
but nothing big okay.

14:08.855 --> 14:11.925
And I'm sure Brandon
will have Lauren over.

14:11.957 --> 14:13.793
I'm sure he will.

14:13.826 --> 14:17.096
All right, baby, I love you.

14:17.129 --> 14:18.831
I love you too Mom.

14:18.865 --> 14:21.000
- I'm gonna finish packing.
- Okie dokes.

14:22.903 --> 14:25.873
Hey listen, have a couple
of your buddies over

14:25.905 --> 14:27.974
from the team, okay.

14:28.008 --> 14:31.078
Nothing too crazy,
maybe a few girls,

14:32.546 --> 14:34.815
I'm sure there's a
girl out that you like.

14:35.948 --> 14:39.152
But just remember...
Be responsible.

14:39.186 --> 14:40.687
- Yes, thank you.
- I know.

14:40.720 --> 14:42.623
Hey, hey, hey
where are you going,

14:42.655 --> 14:43.823
with my bacon.

14:46.525 --> 14:47.694
Shut the door!

14:48.928 --> 14:51.932
This guy is driving
me nuts, please.

14:54.167 --> 14:58.705
Please make sure he doesn't
burn the house down.

14:58.738 --> 15:00.274
Door!

15:00.307 --> 15:04.110
- While we're gone.
- All right, I'll do my best.

15:05.278 --> 15:07.181
All right, have
a good practice

15:07.214 --> 15:09.650
and we'll be back Monday
for the game okay?

15:09.682 --> 15:11.951
- Great have fun.
- You too.

15:14.221 --> 15:16.222
- You all right?
- Oh yeah.

15:18.557 --> 15:22.196
Hey, all right, yeah we
should be getting on the road

15:22.229 --> 15:23.430
in about an hour.

15:24.297 --> 15:26.200
Yeah, it looks good to me, yeah.

15:45.985 --> 15:49.823
My family's pretty
cool but they don't know.

15:58.298 --> 16:01.335
Hey guys, one last thing
if you or anyone you know

16:01.368 --> 16:02.936
is in danger of
committing suicide,

16:02.969 --> 16:05.072
reach out to their parents.

16:05.105 --> 16:06.773
And if you're not
comfortable with that,

16:06.806 --> 16:08.809
you can call this
hotline number.

16:08.841 --> 16:09.675
It's

16:12.345 --> 16:14.815
Somebody will be
there to talk to you.

16:14.847 --> 16:16.115
I'm gonna
play that again.

16:17.384 --> 16:18.786
1-800-273-8255.

16:21.153 --> 16:22.755
You guys got that?

16:25.591 --> 16:27.927
Somebody will be
there to talk to you.

16:27.961 --> 16:31.264
And you can always,
always reach out to me.

16:32.666 --> 16:35.235
Sometimes this world
can be a lonely place

16:35.268 --> 16:37.037
and you just need a friend.

16:38.138 --> 16:39.907
Even if it's somebody
you don't know.

16:41.073 --> 16:42.942
Jenna, come on let's go.

16:42.975 --> 16:45.078
Okay, guys, I gotta go.

16:45.912 --> 16:47.381
Have an amazing day.

17:05.298 --> 17:06.200

is still my favorite.

20:17.957 --> 20:19.726
I know but do you think
this could go on the album?

20:19.759 --> 20:21.228
Definitely.

20:47.353 --> 20:50.190
I am here with one of
my best friends, Taylor.

20:50.222 --> 20:51.758
Hi.

20:51.790 --> 20:53.425
She's also my roommate.

20:53.459 --> 20:56.163
She's very supportive
of our mission

20:56.195 --> 20:57.830
and she has something
say about it.

21:01.067 --> 21:03.303
Come on don't you
have anything to say?

21:03.336 --> 21:04.738
I hate being put on the spot.

21:04.770 --> 21:06.673
- Come on Tay.
- I don't know what to say.

21:06.705 --> 21:08.007
What
about all the kids

21:08.040 --> 21:09.208
that are taking their own lives?

21:09.241 --> 21:13.078
I think it's really
sad, like so sad.

21:13.112 --> 21:16.048
This girl
is so annoying.

21:16.082 --> 21:18.018
Today isn't about
being sad, Jenna,

21:18.050 --> 21:19.785
today is about having fun.

21:19.818 --> 21:23.455
Okay, fine, she's right, I'm
gonna try and have fun today

21:23.489 --> 21:24.658
you guys.

21:24.691 --> 21:26.159
I'm breaking the
rules a little bit,

21:26.192 --> 21:27.995
I'm skipping all my classes.

21:28.827 --> 21:29.663
Sorry Mom.

21:30.863 --> 21:33.567
- What's up bitches.
- Hey Michelle.

21:34.901 --> 21:39.005
- Oh good morning sexy slut.
- Oh my god.

21:39.038 --> 21:41.173
- Now the party starts.
- Yeah.

21:41.207 --> 21:42.943
- You ready to get started?
- I guess so.

21:56.455 --> 22:00.459
This is my rink, it's
been my second home

22:00.492 --> 22:01.761
since I was five.

22:03.262 --> 22:04.497
I love playing hockey.

22:06.164 --> 22:07.600
It's all I ever wanted to do.

22:10.036 --> 22:11.671
There's this adrenaline
rush that runs through

22:11.703 --> 22:12.838
your whole body.

22:17.109 --> 22:18.678
Makes you forget
about everything.

22:22.048 --> 22:24.550
My brother feels the
same way about his music.

22:27.252 --> 22:30.557
My dad always told
us, life's meaningless

22:30.589 --> 22:32.692
until you find what
you're passionate about.

22:34.359 --> 22:38.965
And when you find it, you
found your reason for living.

22:41.433 --> 22:42.335
Life's meaningless
until you find

22:42.367 --> 22:44.403
what you're passionate about

22:44.436 --> 22:49.275
and when you find it, you've
found your reason for living.

22:57.083 --> 22:59.052
So what happens when
you hate what you love?

23:03.923 --> 23:06.826
Let's go,
pick it up boys!

23:06.858 --> 23:08.461
You're falling asleep
on me, let's go!

23:10.863 --> 23:14.601
Wade, you're going
through the motions, son!

23:14.634 --> 23:16.903
Skate like a man,
pussy, get off your feet!

23:16.935 --> 23:17.736
Fucking faggot.

23:17.769 --> 23:19.038
Get up you little bitch!

23:19.071 --> 23:21.107
ice Wade.

23:23.643 --> 23:25.545
Fucking bench warmer.

23:26.846 --> 23:28.248
You ain't going nowhere
boy, fucking faggot,

23:28.280 --> 23:31.017
get off the fucking ice.

23:33.819 --> 23:35.388
Come on McCann, bring it in!

23:37.789 --> 23:39.858
Get in here, on me now!

23:39.892 --> 23:41.494
What are you guys
doing on my ice?

23:41.527 --> 23:43.063
What's going on out there!

23:43.096 --> 23:44.698
- Fucking benchwarmer...
- Turn that damn camera off!

23:59.345 --> 24:02.582
So here it is, I'm
not gay, I'm a girl

24:09.622 --> 24:11.758
but I'm trapped in a boy's body.

24:14.626 --> 24:16.762
And I've been that way
ever since I was four.

24:21.534 --> 24:23.503
- Can I come in?
- No.

24:25.438 --> 24:26.440
- Excuse me?
- Mom, I'm busy.

24:29.942 --> 24:31.310
Okay, I
understand you're busy

24:31.344 --> 24:32.644
but I haven't seen you all day

24:32.678 --> 24:35.548
and I'm a little
worried about you.

24:35.580 --> 24:36.782
I wanted to be alone.

24:36.816 --> 24:38.317
Can you open
the door, please?

24:48.227 --> 24:49.062
Thank you.

24:50.195 --> 24:51.130
I'm working
on a school project,

24:51.163 --> 24:52.798
I really need to get back to it.

24:52.832 --> 24:54.067
Can I help?

24:54.099 --> 24:56.301
Mom, no, I'm
really busy right now

24:56.335 --> 24:58.371
and I need to get back to it.

24:58.403 --> 24:59.672
Please just let me close my door

24:59.704 --> 25:01.740
so I can get back to work.

25:01.773 --> 25:03.275
All right.

25:13.719 --> 25:15.555

Jenna's a big girl now

26:04.369 --> 26:06.438
and it's time for
her to have some fun.

26:06.471 --> 26:08.841
She needs a break, she
busts her butt everyday

26:08.875 --> 26:12.444
and she needs to let loose,
you pressure her way too much.

26:12.478 --> 26:14.980
Now come on, how much
more perfect can she be?

26:15.013 --> 26:17.950
Yeah, I mean, you're
suffocating her.

26:17.983 --> 26:20.319
Come on already she works harder
than any other girl I know.

26:20.353 --> 26:21.554
Okay, that's not true.

26:21.586 --> 26:23.288
You do, of course,
she was valedictorian

26:23.321 --> 26:24.756
- of her high school class.
- Barely.

26:24.789 --> 26:29.762
Class president and
she's gonna get a 4.0 GPA.

26:30.630 --> 26:32.098
- I wish.
- Oh please,

26:32.131 --> 26:36.302
she knows she is unlike me
who just give a shit.

26:36.335 --> 26:39.072
She's in every club on campus.

26:39.105 --> 26:40.740

26:40.772 --> 26:42.475
No, yeah, three
more than me.

26:48.013 --> 26:51.750

for god sake.

26:53.152 --> 26:54.988
Yeah, she's a resident
therapist on our floor.

26:59.424 --> 27:01.394

- Stop it, Matt.

28:08.160 --> 28:10.463

28:10.496 --> 28:13.333

when you can be with
a bunch of people,

28:49.035 --> 28:53.974
people you even like and know
but still feel totally alone?

29:04.282 --> 29:07.519
Do you guys understand,
I don't know,

29:07.553 --> 29:09.055
I don't know what I'm saying?

29:16.828 --> 29:18.664
I love hearing from all of you.

29:20.398 --> 29:22.368
I feel so connected to you guys.

29:40.051 --> 29:42.655
There's so much
sadness in the world.

29:44.390 --> 29:46.660
Sometimes I feel like
I can feel all of it.

29:55.768 --> 29:57.202
It's hard to describe.

30:05.845 --> 30:07.413
So my parents and
brother won't be home

30:07.445 --> 30:09.581
for hopefully an hour
so I get to be myself

30:09.615 --> 30:10.650
for a little while.

30:12.050 --> 30:14.453
I'm very excited
but I have to hurry

30:14.487 --> 30:17.691
because if they catch
me, my dad will kill me.

30:25.096 --> 30:28.334
When I was 14 I learned
what transgender meant.

30:29.567 --> 30:31.570
And I cried of happiness.

30:32.671 --> 30:34.207
It was the best day of my life.

30:35.641 --> 30:37.777
I did not have to try to
do boyish things to fit in,

30:37.809 --> 30:39.345
I finally understood who I was.

30:40.246 --> 30:47.487
I wasn't gay, well I guess I am,

30:47.519 --> 30:50.423
I'm a lesbian trapped
in a boy's body.

30:50.455 --> 30:52.692
Not a butch type lesbian,
a lipstick lesbian.

30:56.662 --> 30:58.698
I immediately told my mom

30:59.932 --> 31:02.102
and she told me it
was just a phase.

31:03.067 --> 31:04.569
And that I never truly be a girl

31:04.603 --> 31:08.007
and that God doesn't make
mistakes and I was wrong.

31:11.874 --> 31:13.046
A phase, I don't think so.

31:22.954 --> 31:26.192
FYI, I'm not gonna
look my best today.

31:27.393 --> 31:29.629
I've trained myself to
go pretty fast at this

31:29.662 --> 31:31.396
so I can spend as
much time as a girl

31:31.430 --> 31:33.166
before my parents get home.

31:35.835 --> 31:37.569
I can look much better
than what you'll see.

31:39.438 --> 31:40.273
Anyway.

32:09.300 --> 32:10.569
My room's a little messy.

32:10.603 --> 32:11.604
This is
Brandon Wade here,

32:11.636 --> 32:12.904
this is my song "I'm Not Tired."

32:12.938 --> 32:14.307
I love this song.

32:17.041 --> 32:18.410
Oh god I wish I could sing.

32:20.412 --> 32:22.615
Music makes me so happy,

32:22.647 --> 32:25.250
it makes me forget how sad I am,

32:26.818 --> 32:28.086
it lifts me up.

32:29.320 --> 32:30.990
I need it, you know.

32:33.259 --> 32:36.194
♪ I'm not tired ♪

32:36.228 --> 32:38.431
A lot of kids I talk to online

32:38.463 --> 32:41.433
they tell me that I should
just do drugs to feel better.

32:44.502 --> 32:45.737
It's just not my thing you know.

32:45.770 --> 32:50.643

33:19.305 --> 33:22.241

I cry just looking at me.

33:58.874 --> 33:59.846
I can't even go there right now.

34:02.580 --> 34:07.586
Anyways so my parents made me
go to a bunch of therapists

34:08.454 --> 34:10.356
on and off since I can remember,

34:10.389 --> 34:13.393
only Christian therapists so
that worked out well, huh?

34:15.927 --> 34:18.364
So I never actually got
the therapy I needed

34:18.396 --> 34:20.231
to cure me of my depression.

34:20.264 --> 34:22.000
I only got more
people telling me

34:22.034 --> 34:25.737
that I was selfish and
wrong and that I should look

34:25.771 --> 34:27.106
to God for help.

34:29.340 --> 34:32.210
I painted my toes
purple I love them.

34:33.579 --> 34:35.181
Purple's my favorite color.

34:36.315 --> 34:37.317
I hate pink.

34:38.784 --> 34:41.054
My mom loves pink.

34:44.789 --> 34:47.793
Anyway, the thing
with my parents is

34:56.001 --> 34:58.905
well, I'm just an
embarrassment to them.

35:01.440 --> 35:04.177
They wanted me to be their
perfect, little Christian boy,

35:06.844 --> 35:08.080
and that's not what I am.

35:11.182 --> 35:14.353
They have their Christian
son, my perfect brother

35:14.385 --> 35:17.724
and I just wanted to be
their Christian daughter.

35:19.425 --> 35:21.260
So they took me out
of my brother's school

35:21.293 --> 35:23.896
and I was home schooled
for the rest of the year.

35:23.929 --> 35:27.432
I was basically
locked in a cage.

35:27.465 --> 35:28.900
I mean, they took
away my cellphone

35:28.934 --> 35:32.938
and laptop forbid me from
any sort of social media use,

35:32.971 --> 35:35.340
completely isolating
me from all my friends

35:35.373 --> 35:37.876
who were all pretty
much online and

35:40.978 --> 35:43.014
it was just probably the
worst time of my life

35:43.047 --> 35:46.184
and I realize that my parents
were never gonna come around

35:46.217 --> 35:49.422
and that I would have
to wait until I was 18

35:49.454 --> 35:51.923
to start any sort of
transitioning treatment.

36:04.536 --> 36:06.873
And I don't have
the money for that.

36:11.777 --> 36:13.579
Which means it's probably
never gonna happen.

36:19.684 --> 36:21.721
And that absolutely
breaks my heart.

36:27.391 --> 36:29.561
I cry myself to
sleep every night.

36:32.231 --> 36:33.432
Some nights my
brother will hear me

36:33.465 --> 36:36.602
and he'll sneak in
from the other room

36:38.103 --> 36:42.508
and he tells me that
everything's gonna be all right.

36:47.112 --> 36:49.115
And we just pray to God.

36:54.052 --> 36:56.856
I pray, I pray pretty
much every day.

36:58.222 --> 37:02.561
I've been praying and I
don't really feel any better.

37:11.402 --> 37:12.838
Except for today.

37:17.742 --> 37:19.010
Today was different.

37:21.612 --> 37:23.348
Today I get to share my story.

37:45.637 --> 37:48.007
So, this is me... Nicole.

37:53.811 --> 37:54.813
How do I look?

37:57.449 --> 37:59.952
Write some comments
below and let me know.

38:13.431 --> 38:16.368
I wanna give you a few lessons
about being transgender.

38:18.570 --> 38:21.774
First off, we don't
wanna be seen as trans.

38:23.141 --> 38:26.945
I wanna be seen as a
girl, period, end of story

38:28.981 --> 38:31.617
and if we're girls, we
wanna be seen as guys.

38:33.851 --> 38:35.353
It's that simple for us

38:35.387 --> 38:38.624
but so freaking complicated
for everyone else.

38:44.128 --> 38:48.467
Number two, we can barely
stand to look at ourselves

38:49.467 --> 38:50.536
in the mirror

38:53.572 --> 38:55.474
and it sucks really bad

38:57.376 --> 38:59.946
when you're not okay
with your own body.

39:12.456 --> 39:15.460
I cringe every time I see it and

39:24.536 --> 39:26.871
it messes with your
brain pretty bad.

39:29.340 --> 39:32.978
Number three when your
family calls you by he,

39:37.315 --> 39:38.483
or says my name,

39:43.021 --> 39:45.124
I mean, just hearing
the word, Nick,

39:47.626 --> 39:48.794
freaks me out.

39:52.097 --> 39:53.599
I hate the sound of it,

39:56.934 --> 39:58.871
it makes me wanna kill myself.

40:04.242 --> 40:05.911
Nick is not my name.

40:10.548 --> 40:11.884
My name is Nicole.

40:16.954 --> 40:19.490
Nick is not my name,
Nick is not my name,

40:19.523 --> 40:22.560
Nick is not my name,
it's not my real name!

40:35.507 --> 40:37.909
Hey sorry about earlier,

40:40.711 --> 40:42.715
it's just I get really
angry and then I tromp

40:42.748 --> 40:44.115
and I get really sad.

40:48.219 --> 40:51.556
I've been on antidepressants
for as long as I can remember

40:54.458 --> 40:57.128
and most recently
on sleeping pills

40:57.161 --> 40:59.631
so I can at least sleep
through the night.

41:07.139 --> 41:08.541
I stay up really late

41:12.643 --> 41:15.547
and then that's when a lot of
bad things go through my head.

41:29.628 --> 41:32.097
I used to be super outgoing
when I was younger.

41:35.567 --> 41:36.835
I was never really shy.

41:40.505 --> 41:41.907
Now it's just weird.

41:45.543 --> 41:48.213
I don't make people laugh
like I used to anymore.

41:51.048 --> 41:53.052
I don't crack jokes
like I used to anymore.

41:58.222 --> 42:00.793
Which I miss, a lot.

42:04.362 --> 42:06.132
'Cause I love
seeing people laugh.

42:08.432 --> 42:10.135
Sometimes I just wanna run away.

42:14.271 --> 42:17.175
I just wish I was the same
person just born a girl.

42:23.347 --> 42:28.353
I remember when I was two, I
used to run into my mom's room

42:29.454 --> 42:31.490
holding my penis saying
"I want this off,

42:31.523 --> 42:32.791
I want this off."

42:34.192 --> 42:36.929
I used to dream that
my fairy godmother

42:36.961 --> 42:38.362
would come and wake me up
in the middle of the night

42:38.396 --> 42:41.200
and go poof and my
penis would be gone.

42:50.708 --> 42:53.511
I really hate my
penis, I hate it!

43:01.353 --> 43:03.387
I understand that
I was never the boy

43:03.420 --> 43:05.156
that my dad really wanted.

43:07.324 --> 43:11.529
I also know that I'll never
be Daddy's little girl.

43:17.668 --> 43:20.772
I just wished that there was
someway to make this all right.

43:25.943 --> 43:27.913
And I feel bad for
all the parents too.

43:31.550 --> 43:34.820
I just wish that they could
put aside their own bigotry

43:34.853 --> 43:37.055
or feelings enough to
say it doesn't matter

43:37.088 --> 43:40.325
if you're gay, lesbian,
transgender, why should it matter,

43:40.358 --> 43:41.861
I love you anyways?

43:49.800 --> 43:51.971
- Oh shit.
- What the hell?

43:56.273 --> 43:57.175
Nick, Nick!

44:00.545 --> 44:01.380
Nick!

44:04.215 --> 44:06.218
Nick, open the door now!

44:07.851 --> 44:09.587
Open up the door now Nick!

44:09.621 --> 44:11.891
What did I tell you about
locking doors in this house!

44:13.958 --> 44:15.994
Open this door now
before I bust it down!

44:54.666 --> 44:57.303
- You can keep those sweats.
- Thanks.

44:59.204 --> 45:01.073
You know I don't know
how to help you Wade?

45:02.773 --> 45:04.509
You made it worse
going to the principal.

45:04.541 --> 45:06.144
You can't do that shit!

45:08.713 --> 45:09.681
You have a problem
with your team

45:09.713 --> 45:11.782
you work it out with your team.

45:11.815 --> 45:13.084
I understand.

45:14.485 --> 45:17.889
You know you're one of the
better players out there, right

45:19.356 --> 45:21.393
but you've been slacking
off the last few weeks, son.

45:22.927 --> 45:24.363
I know.

45:24.396 --> 45:26.832
Well get your shit together
this is your senior year.

45:27.731 --> 45:28.532
Coach, oh sorry.

45:28.565 --> 45:30.034
Come here Waters.

45:30.902 --> 45:32.971
What's going on with you guys?

45:33.003 --> 45:34.605
Stop picking on Wade!

45:34.639 --> 45:36.275
- I haven't done anything.
- It's not him.

45:39.244 --> 45:41.646
Good, then talk
to the other guys.

45:42.780 --> 45:43.949
I will.

45:43.981 --> 45:46.184
Look we got our
first game on Tuesday,

45:46.217 --> 45:48.253
I don't want this
shit on my ice!

45:50.320 --> 45:52.657
- I mean it Waters.
- I get it.

45:55.025 --> 45:56.193
I'm late for a meeting.

45:56.226 --> 45:58.196
You guys work this shit out!

45:59.731 --> 46:01.033
I'll talk to you on Monday.

46:05.070 --> 46:06.505
Where are they now?

46:06.538 --> 46:09.440
Showers but what is that?

46:09.474 --> 46:11.043
Are you filming this?

46:12.409 --> 46:14.445
James what are you
doing, I saw you in there

46:14.478 --> 46:16.847
There's Wade, we missed
you in the showers, buddy.

46:16.880 --> 46:18.549
Hey Burgess, Vargas,
Renzi he's right here!

46:18.583 --> 46:20.751
- Go lock the door McCann.
- On it.

46:20.784 --> 46:22.453
There's that little
motherfucker right there.

46:22.487 --> 46:26.258
Yeah, you like that,
like that little buddy.

46:26.291 --> 46:28.026
So what's your
fucking problem, huh?

46:28.059 --> 46:29.227
I don't
have a problem.

46:29.260 --> 46:30.495
- Yeah, you fucking do!
- Fucking pussy!

46:30.527 --> 46:31.429
And a fucking snitch!

46:31.463 --> 46:33.065
Ugly motherfucker!

46:34.032 --> 46:35.867
Hey are you a faggot?

46:35.900 --> 46:37.102
No.

46:37.135 --> 46:38.670
Yes you are
'cause you ain't getting

46:38.702 --> 46:39.603
any fucking pussy.

46:39.637 --> 46:40.872
What fucking senior

46:40.905 --> 46:41.807
is still a fucking virgin,

46:41.840 --> 46:43.942
McCann, are you a virgin.

46:43.974 --> 46:45.810
Fuck no, I'm up
to five freshman already.

46:45.844 --> 46:47.311
Yo Renzi
what about you man?

46:47.344 --> 46:49.146
I'm going on four
if I include your mother.

46:49.179 --> 46:51.382
- Hey Waters, what about you?
- Uh no.

46:51.416 --> 46:53.985
Yeah, I didn't think
so not with that donkey dick!

46:54.018 --> 46:56.655
Waters, get
over here and get a hit!

46:58.523 --> 46:59.358
Let's go!

47:00.525 --> 47:02.260
Waters, Waters,
Waters, Waters!

47:03.094 --> 47:03.929
Come on!

47:03.961 --> 47:05.630
I'm good.

47:06.965 --> 47:09.034
Get over
here and get a hit!

47:09.067 --> 47:10.534
That was a
pussy kick, Waters,

47:10.568 --> 47:11.336
we all knew you were a faggot,
just like little Jamie here.

47:11.369 --> 47:12.571
Come on!

47:12.603 --> 47:15.206
Kick
him again, Waters!

47:15.239 --> 47:19.009
Fucking hit him,
fucking hit him, give it to him!

47:22.713 --> 47:26.351
That's what
I'm talking about.

47:26.384 --> 47:28.385
You want me to
stop kicking you huh, huh,

47:28.418 --> 47:30.621
then get the fuck
up and fight me!

47:30.655 --> 47:33.492
I'm not
gonna fight you.

47:33.525 --> 47:36.293
'Cause you're a
fucking faggot aren't you?

47:36.327 --> 47:37.696
Oh you wanna get fucked instead,

47:37.728 --> 47:39.096
you wanna get
fucked instead, huh?

47:39.130 --> 47:43.235
Say it, I'm a fucking
faggot, I'm a fucking faggot.

47:43.268 --> 47:46.871
Give it to him!

47:46.905 --> 47:48.373
Let's go!

47:48.405 --> 47:50.907
Oh shit look, he wants it
he's already bent over.

47:50.909 --> 47:52.811
Oh shit
he's getting it again.

47:52.844 --> 47:54.079
Oh he loves this
shit, McCann give me your stick.

47:54.112 --> 47:55.380
No, no,
no, not with my stick!

47:55.413 --> 47:56.615
Come on!

47:56.648 --> 47:58.150
You're getting fucked
little faggot, huh,

47:58.182 --> 47:59.583
but you like it
don't you, don't you?

47:59.617 --> 48:01.853
All right
enough leave him alone.

48:01.885 --> 48:03.154
What the
fuck did you just say?

48:03.188 --> 48:04.422
I think
that's enough for today.

48:04.454 --> 48:06.557
It sounds like
you fucking want it too.

48:06.590 --> 48:08.259
Fuck you man.

48:08.293 --> 48:10.996
Yo, fuck
all this shit game on.

48:11.028 --> 48:12.431
Let's go.

48:34.719 --> 48:36.588
We're gonna bury
your ass fucking live yeah!

48:36.621 --> 48:40.159
You're gonna fucking die today
man, you're fucking done!

48:43.862 --> 48:45.430
Hey come
on, let's go take him.

48:45.463 --> 48:47.365
Open the fucking
door, yo we're going.

48:47.398 --> 48:48.567
That way, that way.

48:48.599 --> 48:49.768
Come on, let's go,
take him this way.

48:49.800 --> 48:52.304
To the stairs, let's go!

48:54.639 --> 48:55.440
Yeah!

48:55.472 --> 48:56.708
To the stairs.

48:58.275 --> 48:59.643
Come on, Waters, let's go!

48:59.677 --> 49:02.414
Come on let's go top
of the stairs, come on!

49:02.447 --> 49:04.782
Put him right onto the edge.

49:10.554 --> 49:12.489
Ready for a ride little boy!

49:12.523 --> 49:15.827
Yo, yo, shut the fuck up,
I wanna talk to this clown.

49:15.860 --> 49:17.229
You're a fucking loser.

49:17.262 --> 49:18.697
You're fucking nothing.

49:18.730 --> 49:20.632
- Fucking hockey player.
- Tell him like it is.

49:20.664 --> 49:22.132
You suck, you're not
fucking tough enough,

49:22.166 --> 49:23.668
you can't fight in there and
you can't fight on the ice.

49:23.701 --> 49:25.836
That's why you don't
have a girlfriend, huh.

49:25.869 --> 49:27.137
That's why you don't
have any fucking friends.

49:27.170 --> 49:31.108
Yo if I was you I would
fucking kill myself.

49:31.141 --> 49:32.676
Yeah kill yourself,
kill yourself.

49:32.710 --> 49:33.711
Toss him down the stairs!

49:33.744 --> 49:35.512
Toss him down the stairs!

49:35.545 --> 49:37.381
Yo, yo, yo, let's get
out of here, hey, hey

49:37.414 --> 49:38.382
party at Renzi's right?

49:38.416 --> 49:39.217
Yeah!

49:40.351 --> 49:40.986
- Alcohol.
- Let's get the fuck

49:41.018 --> 49:41.785
out of here!

49:41.818 --> 49:43.255
Let's go baby.

49:43.288 --> 49:47.659
Yo Wade if you can walk
we'd love to fucking have you.

49:49.960 --> 49:51.729
Let's go, see you later Wade.

49:54.465 --> 49:58.637
Hey man, it's Waters,
come on, come on, lets go.

49:59.704 --> 50:00.739
I'll take you home.

50:02.106 --> 50:04.676
Hey, it's Travis Waters,
I want everyone to know

50:04.708 --> 50:06.377
that I had no part in this shit.

50:06.411 --> 50:09.246
I wanted to stop it, James
have I ever done anything

50:09.280 --> 50:10.081
to hurt you?

50:10.114 --> 50:10.949
No.

50:12.684 --> 50:16.121
This dude has done nothing
to deserve this, nothing.

50:16.153 --> 50:18.590
And we were all friends one
day and then they just stopped

50:18.623 --> 50:20.659
liking him, why?

50:20.692 --> 50:23.827
Who gives the fuck why, who
does this shit to people?

50:23.860 --> 50:26.597
People who are fucking
crazy that's who.

50:26.630 --> 50:28.098
This shit has happened
to James before

50:28.132 --> 50:31.735
and to other kids and the
school has done nothing.

50:31.768 --> 50:33.804
I mean, the principal
came to talk to us

50:33.838 --> 50:35.507
but that did shit.

50:35.539 --> 50:37.909
And our coach was
fucking pissed.

50:37.942 --> 50:40.579
- Have you told your parents?
- No.

50:42.380 --> 50:43.615
My parents would
have gone ballistic,

50:43.648 --> 50:45.083
they would have taken
on the whole school.

50:47.518 --> 50:48.653
My would have too.

50:50.521 --> 50:53.490
But I mean, you have what you
need to take these fucks out.

50:53.523 --> 50:55.092
Turn the camera off.

50:59.130 --> 51:02.000
Dude if we release stuff now

51:02.032 --> 51:04.435
there's no hockey for
any of us through season

51:04.469 --> 51:07.539
and that just fucks
everyone including you.

51:07.572 --> 51:10.208
Bro, this shit
will be everywhere.

51:10.240 --> 51:11.141
If that would...

51:11.175 --> 51:12.477
Turn the fucking camera off!

51:13.844 --> 51:16.380
Jesus Christ,
what I need more time!

51:16.414 --> 51:18.717
Excuse me, you
know you're not supposed

51:18.750 --> 51:20.818
to talk to me like that.

51:20.851 --> 51:21.752
You promised Dr. Gould
you were gonna work

51:21.786 --> 51:23.355
on these outbursts.

51:24.755 --> 51:25.856
And you promised
Dr. Gould you weren't gonna be

51:25.889 --> 51:27.658
so fucking on me all the time.

51:27.692 --> 51:30.494
She told you, you're
supposed to give me my space.

51:31.628 --> 51:35.733
Billy, I'm
just worried about you.

51:35.766 --> 51:38.068
You're not sticking
to the schedules,

51:38.101 --> 51:40.672
you're not eating, you
barely leave your room.

51:40.704 --> 51:42.473
You don't hang out with
your friends anymore.

51:42.507 --> 51:44.775
I just need to know
that you're okay.

51:44.809 --> 51:46.478
Mom, I'm okay.

51:48.612 --> 51:51.482
You know
what today is, right?

51:51.516 --> 51:53.585
Of course.

51:53.617 --> 51:54.853
Maybe I
should call out so

51:54.885 --> 51:56.688
maybe we can spend
some time together.

51:56.721 --> 51:59.958
I'm on the overnights
unless ER's slow.

52:01.059 --> 52:04.028
Mom, I'm
okay, have a good shift,

52:04.061 --> 52:07.431
I just, I really need to
get back to this project.

52:08.965 --> 52:12.804
Okay, I'll check
in later, I love you.

52:14.938 --> 52:16.474
I love you too.

52:19.409 --> 52:23.580
Hey guys, I'm here with the
cutest boy ever, Matty Matt.

52:23.614 --> 52:26.351
Hey everybody
what's up ladies?

52:27.617 --> 52:28.886
So I just wanted to touch base

52:28.920 --> 52:30.588
on what we were
talking about earlier

52:30.621 --> 52:32.356
you know with the
pressure from the parents

52:32.389 --> 52:34.491
and school and everything.

52:36.027 --> 52:39.898
Oh that means it's 5:59, it's
time for my daily mom call.

52:41.331 --> 52:45.636
It should be happening,
in five, four, three, two.

52:47.204 --> 52:49.141
It's never a second late.

52:50.708 --> 52:52.744
Here you take over
for awhile okay?

52:59.250 --> 53:00.652
Hey Mom.

53:00.684 --> 53:04.556
Jenna, why did you change
your profile picture?

53:05.789 --> 53:07.425
What?

53:07.458 --> 53:09.561
When did you do
it, this morning?

53:11.027 --> 53:14.031
I don't know I did
it like a couple hours ago.

53:15.465 --> 53:18.869
You know I don't like it,
it's really a horrible picture

53:18.902 --> 53:23.407
of you, oh and put the
homecoming theme picture back up,

53:23.440 --> 53:26.710
I mean, you're so much
prettier in that picture.

53:26.744 --> 53:29.114
You know Aunt Susan
thinks so too.

53:29.146 --> 53:30.382
Okay.

53:32.617 --> 53:35.987
So, has your
asshole father called you?

53:36.920 --> 53:37.755
No.

53:38.789 --> 53:42.027
Oh, typical,
nothing's changed there.

53:45.530 --> 53:47.899
Clearly he doesn't give a shit.

53:47.931 --> 53:51.135
But some people just
aren't meant to be parents.

53:53.271 --> 53:56.807
Oh I bought you the
cutest dress yesterday,

53:56.840 --> 53:58.742
Diane and I went into the city.

53:58.775 --> 54:01.044
It's gonna look
absolutely amazing on you

54:01.077 --> 54:03.014
when you come home
for Thanksgiving

54:03.047 --> 54:05.717
as long as you don't
gain the freshman 15.

54:07.050 --> 54:08.719
I'm not
gaining any weight Mom.

54:08.753 --> 54:10.555
I actually gotta go
I have a huge test

54:10.588 --> 54:12.090
that I have to study for.

54:12.123 --> 54:14.592
Okay, good, good 'cause
you shouldn't be wasting

54:14.625 --> 54:16.728
your time with those girls
that keep tagging you

54:16.760 --> 54:18.329
in those pictures.

54:18.362 --> 54:20.597
None of them are
really that pretty,

54:20.630 --> 54:22.399
especially the one
with the big nose.

54:22.432 --> 54:25.402
Mom, okay I
gotta go, I gotta go.

54:25.436 --> 54:28.006
Okay I'll call you
tomorrow same time.

54:28.039 --> 54:29.441
- I love you.
- Bye.

54:43.820 --> 54:45.589
Jenna let's go down and
meet up with everybody.

54:46.891 --> 54:48.726
Yeah, I'll be
down in a minute.

54:51.195 --> 54:53.030
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

54:54.599 --> 54:57.367
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

54:57.400 --> 54:59.803
- All right, hurry up.
- Okay.

55:20.757 --> 55:23.761
She's right about
one thing, my dad.

55:26.097 --> 55:28.600
I texted and I called
him five times yesterday

55:28.632 --> 55:29.900
and he didn't reply.

55:31.369 --> 55:33.938
His assistant called me and said

55:33.971 --> 55:36.273
that we could set up
a time to talk today.

55:38.675 --> 55:41.913
I know that you're
busy Dad but really?

55:45.815 --> 55:47.551
I even left him a
message to let him know

55:47.585 --> 55:50.153
that I'm feeling sad again.

55:50.186 --> 55:52.958
I've been feeling
sad for awhile now.

55:56.860 --> 55:58.328
Do you guys remember
that time last Christmas

55:58.362 --> 56:00.298
when I didn't post for awhile.

56:01.998 --> 56:04.268
Yeah I was really sad then.

56:05.568 --> 56:08.038
I was really depressed
and I had no idea why.

56:11.775 --> 56:13.844
But your comments
and your messages

56:13.878 --> 56:15.780
are what got me through.

56:17.047 --> 56:19.583
So thank you, thank
you, thank you.

56:21.452 --> 56:23.454
Sometimes this
world is a sad place

56:23.487 --> 56:26.758
and it's hard for me
to take, you know?

56:31.628 --> 56:34.766
I've tried so hard to
just have fun today

56:34.798 --> 56:37.067
and forget about
everything but I can't.

56:41.038 --> 56:43.675
I've written a few poems
over the past year.

56:46.110 --> 56:48.480
And I don't usually share
this type of stuff, but

56:50.347 --> 56:52.784
I wanna share one

Inside I feel I can
disappear without a trace.

57:31.222 --> 57:35.727
In many roads the heavy loads
why can't I tell anyone?

57:36.594 --> 57:38.362
Why won't you understand?

57:41.364 --> 57:44.368
The pain hurts along
with the fears.

57:46.302 --> 57:48.472
You see happy I see tears.

57:52.876 --> 57:55.413
This burden's too much

57:55.445 --> 57:58.717
but you carry on conversation
and such and such.

58:01.952 --> 58:04.856
I wished to be
someone or something

58:09.260 --> 58:12.263
but unfortunately
I'm none, nothing.

58:24.340 --> 58:26.943
And that's why it's really
important that we need to respect

58:26.976 --> 58:30.748
everybody's opinion because
everybody is a human being.

58:32.949 --> 58:37.554
Okay listen, listen,

58:52.202 --> 58:53.905

58:56.706 --> 59:00.711

you honor and praise amen.

Amen.

59:11.021 --> 59:13.358
I know that you
will handle this beautifully

59:14.425 --> 59:17.195
and I think it
wouldn't be a bad idea

59:17.228 --> 59:21.566
to call the hotline that
I have the number for.

59:21.599 --> 59:22.900
No.

59:22.932 --> 59:26.637
It's Christian
and they know just how

59:26.670 --> 59:28.905
they've helped more people.

59:28.938 --> 59:30.507
They have wisdom we don't.

59:30.541 --> 59:32.710
Big city
Christian is not the same

59:32.742 --> 59:34.177
as country Christian.

59:34.210 --> 59:38.015
We both know this I don't
want this getting out.

59:40.150 --> 59:42.385
No I don't
neither, I just want us

59:42.418 --> 59:43.855
to have, be equipped.

59:46.422 --> 59:48.792
The only equipment
we need is from the Bible.

59:48.826 --> 59:50.228
The Bible tells us what to do.

59:50.260 --> 59:52.230
God you're being
so stubborn about this.

59:52.262 --> 59:54.130
I'm just saying maybe we
could get a little help.

59:54.164 --> 59:55.533
Well what do
you want me to do,

59:55.565 --> 59:59.035
take away his cellphone,
send him to gay camp,

59:59.068 --> 01:00:00.538
what do you want?

01:00:00.570 --> 01:00:02.005
You act like I condone this.

01:00:02.039 --> 01:00:04.108
No, it's just too much, we
can't even leave him home alone

01:00:04.141 --> 01:00:06.744
anymore.

01:00:06.777 --> 01:00:08.679
Jeff eat your broccoli.

01:00:08.711 --> 01:00:09.679
I told you I
don't like broccoli.

01:00:09.713 --> 01:00:11.349
Jeff, eat your broccoli!

01:00:11.382 --> 01:00:12.950
I just pray no one
saw him like this

01:00:12.983 --> 01:00:14.986
because I can't take it anymore.

01:00:15.018 --> 01:00:16.486
I just can't.

01:00:16.519 --> 01:00:18.855
I did not raise him
to be like this,

01:00:18.889 --> 01:00:20.358
this isn't my fault.

01:00:20.391 --> 01:00:21.858
Oh and I did?

01:00:21.891 --> 01:00:22.826
Yeah, you were never home,
you never played with him.

01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:24.095
I was working.

01:00:24.128 --> 01:00:25.663
Yeah, and you treated
him different than Jeff

01:00:25.695 --> 01:00:27.864
and you were embarrassed of him.

01:00:27.898 --> 01:00:29.100
So were you.

01:00:29.132 --> 01:00:31.902
Why is God doing
this to us, why?

01:01:00.197 --> 01:01:01.532
You're excused.

01:01:05.436 --> 01:01:07.038
Dad, please.

01:01:07.070 --> 01:01:08.605
No go to your room.

01:01:11.407 --> 01:01:12.643
I'm hungry.

01:01:12.675 --> 01:01:14.444
Don't make me get
up from this chair.

01:01:16.646 --> 01:01:17.981
- Mom.
- Just go.

01:01:19.782 --> 01:01:22.185
Now!

01:01:24.887 --> 01:01:26.223
Tuck in your chair.

01:01:30.628 --> 01:01:31.461
Boy.

01:01:33.664 --> 01:01:36.367
Stop it, control yourself.

01:01:39.235 --> 01:01:40.070
I mean it.

01:02:08.998 --> 01:02:11.067
Do not go in his room.

01:02:11.101 --> 01:02:12.269
Okay.

01:02:29.619 --> 01:02:33.391

Oh my god, I love that one.

01:03:41.425 --> 01:03:43.427
- Thanks.

01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:45.195
Well yeah, who else
would it be about?

01:03:46.195 --> 01:03:48.498
Hey cutie, whoa are you okay?

01:03:48.532 --> 01:03:50.434

We're taking off in a minute.

01:04:03.413 --> 01:04:04.882
We're gonna be back
late, late tonight.

01:04:04.914 --> 01:04:07.585
Maybe tomorrow morning,
we'll see how it goes,

01:04:07.617 --> 01:04:09.753
you know your brother
can be a dick, so.

01:04:09.786 --> 01:04:11.154

01:06:40.971 --> 01:06:44.942
So I need to be honest with
you guys about something,

01:06:44.974 --> 01:06:46.409
I struggle with depression.

01:06:48.378 --> 01:06:49.947
I've been on and off
meds this past year

01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:51.748
and I'm not supposed
to talk about it,

01:06:51.782 --> 01:06:53.651
my mom says because
it's bad for my image

01:06:53.684 --> 01:06:55.886
and I've been seeing a therapist

01:06:55.918 --> 01:06:57.788
but my therapist
doesn't actually think

01:06:57.820 --> 01:06:59.257
that I'm depressed.

01:07:01.458 --> 01:07:03.693
Nobody else knows about this

01:07:05.829 --> 01:07:08.332
well, now everybody
does.

01:07:08.364 --> 01:07:10.100
My mom is gonna be so mad.

01:07:15.237 --> 01:07:16.739
If you're watching
this right now

01:07:16.773 --> 01:07:18.541
and you struggle
with depression,

01:07:18.574 --> 01:07:21.344
talk to somebody, reach out,

01:07:21.378 --> 01:07:23.180
that's where the
support of others

01:07:23.213 --> 01:07:25.749
is gonna help you big time.

01:07:25.782 --> 01:07:27.851
You may not wanna talk to
your teacher or your pastor

01:07:27.884 --> 01:07:30.353
or whomever but telling
somebody in confidence,

01:07:30.387 --> 01:07:33.624
you stand a greater
chance of getting the help

01:07:33.657 --> 01:07:35.793
that you deserve.

01:07:35.826 --> 01:07:37.226
I'm not gonna go on and on

01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:40.030
but I've just been hearing
about so many people

01:07:40.063 --> 01:07:42.199
taking their own lives
because of depression.

01:07:43.666 --> 01:07:47.304
So before I go know
that you matter,

01:07:49.572 --> 01:07:53.877
that you are special
and that you are loved.

01:07:56.313 --> 01:07:59.317
So before I go know
that you matter,

01:08:01.650 --> 01:08:05.322
that you are special
and that you are loved.

01:08:09.925 --> 01:08:12.730
Okay now let's go out there
and have an amazing rest

01:08:12.762 --> 01:08:16.733
of the day because I know
I'm going to and you can too.

01:08:19.336 --> 01:08:22.340
Okay, goodbye you guys.

01:09:51.795 --> 01:09:53.662
This happened two
weeks ago as well.

01:09:57.934 --> 01:09:59.869
Vargas told me it
would happen again

01:10:04.207 --> 01:10:06.744
on Saturday right
after practice.

01:10:15.185 --> 01:10:16.654
He was right on time.

01:10:27.063 --> 01:10:28.632
That's why I'm filming today.

01:10:37.908 --> 01:10:41.045
This happens to so
many kids everyday.

01:10:50.554 --> 01:10:55.259
But it's just an article or
a headline that you read.

01:11:02.765 --> 01:11:04.434
This is really happening

01:11:08.438 --> 01:11:12.275
and no one is fucking
doing anything about it!

01:11:13.342 --> 01:11:15.311
I mean look at my social media!

01:11:15.345 --> 01:11:17.748
Look at all the comments,
it's all right there

01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:20.551
every fucking day!

01:11:21.717 --> 01:11:24.820
I tell the coach, I tell
the fucking principal,

01:11:24.854 --> 01:11:26.722
why the fuck me!

01:11:26.756 --> 01:11:29.260
What the fuck did I do!

01:12:08.765 --> 01:12:12.570
I will never step
foot in a rink again.

01:12:20.377 --> 01:12:24.448
I will never be
on that ice again.

01:12:28.952 --> 01:12:31.454
They made me hate what I love.

01:12:51.073 --> 01:12:55.745
Okay, I'm really upset
right now you guys.

01:12:58.681 --> 01:13:00.350
The world has gone mad.

01:13:02.752 --> 01:13:06.923
I can't take it, I can't
take it, I can't take it.

01:13:19.836 --> 01:13:22.539
So I've gotten a bunch
of views and comments

01:13:22.572 --> 01:13:24.141
on my videos earlier

01:13:25.574 --> 01:13:27.443
and I'd like to share
some of them with you.

01:13:32.114 --> 01:13:35.418
The court may approve it,
the government may allow it

01:13:35.452 --> 01:13:36.619
but God won't.

01:13:43.359 --> 01:13:46.429
If God is the creator of
it all, isn't he behind it?

01:13:54.237 --> 01:13:58.274
Hey freak, I used to play
with Barbies when I was a kid,

01:13:58.307 --> 01:14:01.078
I wanted to be like my sisters.

01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:03.314
I even wore dresses
and put on makeup.

01:14:04.546 --> 01:14:06.882
My mom made me do boy
stuff, I grew out of it,

01:14:06.916 --> 01:14:08.952
you're crazy and delusional.

01:14:08.984 --> 01:14:10.786
Listen to your parents,
they're trying to love you

01:14:10.819 --> 01:14:12.322
but you're being selfish.

01:14:16.158 --> 01:14:18.061
How am I being selfish?

01:14:27.804 --> 01:14:30.039
Your body is not
wrong, your brain is,

01:14:30.073 --> 01:14:31.675
get some psychiatric help.

01:14:33.143 --> 01:14:35.311
God doesn't make mistakes,
you're a boy god dang it.

01:14:42.786 --> 01:14:44.387
Not all comments are bad.

01:14:47.489 --> 01:14:50.293
There are some that are
encouraging and hopeful.

01:14:53.962 --> 01:14:56.432
It's just hard to not focus on
the negative ones, you know?

01:15:01.770 --> 01:15:03.439
This new one just came in.

01:15:13.015 --> 01:15:14.850
This world needs
less people like you,

01:15:14.884 --> 01:15:16.720
so do us the honors,

01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:20.591
you know the rest.

01:15:37.039 --> 01:15:38.708
What the hell are you doing?

01:15:40.042 --> 01:15:41.744
Are you filming again?

01:15:41.778 --> 01:15:42.646
Oh Jesus.

01:15:42.679 --> 01:15:43.613
You little shit!

01:15:43.645 --> 01:15:45.014
God damn it stop!

01:15:45.047 --> 01:15:46.382
Why are you doing this?

01:15:46.416 --> 01:15:47.251
Get him.

01:15:53.256 --> 01:15:54.825
I have one question
for you people,

01:15:56.292 --> 01:15:59.563
how can you bash somebody
so constantly and so much

01:15:59.595 --> 01:16:04.200
and so consistently until
somebody wants to fucking die?

01:16:05.368 --> 01:16:08.038
How could you do that,
how could you bully them

01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:10.774
and make fun of them and
torture them until they say,

01:16:10.806 --> 01:16:13.342
"All right, you're fucking
torturing me right now."

01:16:14.577 --> 01:16:15.913
Shut the fuck up!

01:16:17.579 --> 01:16:19.416
How could you do that?

01:16:19.448 --> 01:16:21.550
Yeah, go kill yourself,
go fucking die!

01:16:21.583 --> 01:16:25.154
I would never in my life
say something like that.

01:16:27.556 --> 01:16:29.291
I share my true
feelings with you guys

01:16:29.324 --> 01:16:31.060
and this is what I get.

01:16:32.529 --> 01:16:35.799
You want perfect Jenna, well
surprise she doesn't exist!

01:16:35.832 --> 01:16:38.101
I'm a depressed 18-year-old

01:16:38.134 --> 01:16:41.304
who has no fucking
idea who she is!

01:16:41.337 --> 01:16:44.641
The only thing that she knows
is what people tell her!

01:17:36.859 --> 01:17:37.694
I'm just,

01:17:46.836 --> 01:17:48.070
I can't believe how
much hate there is

01:17:48.104 --> 01:17:49.806
out there in the world.

01:17:58.480 --> 01:17:59.515
I can't take it.

01:18:09.958 --> 01:18:12.528
This one's my brother's song.

01:18:12.561 --> 01:18:14.864
It's called, "What
Do I Deserve?"

01:18:17.132 --> 01:18:18.467

This is Jenna Ross here,
this will be my last vlog.

01:20:13.548 --> 01:20:16.286
I know this probably won't
make sense to a lot of you

01:20:16.319 --> 01:20:18.722
and I want you to know that
I know it's not right for me

01:20:18.755 --> 01:20:19.588
to be doing this.

01:20:21.423 --> 01:20:24.060
I tried to ask for help
but no one heard me,

01:20:24.092 --> 01:20:25.394
not even you guys.

01:20:26.828 --> 01:20:29.065
I told you the signs, not
one of you reached out.

01:20:30.565 --> 01:20:32.501
So the next time you see
someone that looks like

01:20:32.534 --> 01:20:35.337
they have it all,
know that they don't.

01:20:36.404 --> 01:20:38.474
They may be hurting
just like me,

01:20:39.475 --> 01:20:40.744
just like you may be.

01:20:45.247 --> 01:20:47.216
I woke up today knowing
that when today ends,

01:20:47.250 --> 01:20:48.918
I would take my own life.

01:21:02.265 --> 01:21:04.401
I'm going to
Renzi's party tonight.

01:21:05.434 --> 01:21:07.671
I want them all to see my face,

01:21:08.904 --> 01:21:11.041
to see what they've
taken away from me.

01:21:12.175 --> 01:21:16.113
When today ends, I will
have my retribution

01:21:19.282 --> 01:21:21.118
and it's the only
way it will change.

01:21:39.601 --> 01:21:44.608

01:22:04.025 --> 01:22:07.396
I know that I'm going to be
hurting everyone who loves me

01:22:08.363 --> 01:22:10.399
and I really do love them too

01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:13.769
but if you knew what it
was like inside my head,

01:22:15.837 --> 01:22:17.740
if you knew what it
felt like to feel dead,

01:22:20.542 --> 01:22:23.412
if you knew what happened
to me when I was a kid,

01:22:25.747 --> 01:22:27.983
if you really knew
what my mother did.

Hey James, where were
you you missed the party.

01:25:09.444 --> 01:25:11.279
- Come on, let's go.
- Hey are you okay?

01:25:11.313 --> 01:25:12.748
- This guy's a freak, man.
- Shut up.

01:25:27.162 --> 01:25:28.163
Hey James.

01:25:29.765 --> 01:25:31.534
James, what's up bro?

01:25:43.279 --> 01:25:45.248
James what's up buddy?

01:25:47.048 --> 01:25:49.152
Cops just rolled through,

01:25:49.185 --> 01:25:51.487
busted the whole
fucking party, man.

01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:52.789
Are you okay, man?

01:25:52.822 --> 01:25:54.591
You don't look so good,
you need a hit bro?

01:25:55.557 --> 01:25:56.393
No, okay.

01:26:05.801 --> 01:26:08.037
Which corner is
your favorite dude?

01:26:08.069 --> 01:26:08.970
- My favorite.
- Yeah.

01:26:09.003 --> 01:26:10.605
Which corner's your favorite?

01:26:10.639 --> 01:26:12.509
- One, two, three, four.
- The one with the blue paper.

01:26:15.810 --> 01:26:18.113
Yo Waters, where
you going, hey.

01:26:18.146 --> 01:26:20.149
What, I'm just going
to check something.

01:26:20.181 --> 01:26:22.518
Waters,
get your ass back,

01:26:22.551 --> 01:26:24.354
sit your ass back down Waters!

01:26:37.332 --> 01:26:38.734
I love you Mom.

01:26:41.403 --> 01:26:42.572
I love you Dad.

01:26:45.073 --> 01:26:46.341
I love you Brandon.

01:26:50.078 --> 01:26:53.148
Yeah, I might go to art
school now man, fuck hockey.

01:26:53.181 --> 01:26:56.786
Yeah, I can't fucking
do that shit.

01:27:00.421 --> 01:27:03.792
What would you call it,
what is the name of that?

01:27:06.028 --> 01:27:07.063
Come on Renzi!

01:27:10.431 --> 01:27:11.634
Bullshit, crossfit.

01:27:17.907 --> 01:27:19.042
I fucking love that.

01:27:21.210 --> 01:27:23.212
Yo we should make that
our new logo or whatever

01:27:23.244 --> 01:27:24.314
for the team.

01:27:34.689 --> 01:27:36.391
- What the fuck was that?
- Shut the fuck up, shut up!

01:27:36.425 --> 01:27:37.894
What was that?

01:30:06.742 --> 01:30:08.778
This isn't how
it's supposed to end.

01:30:16.885 --> 01:30:18.521
♪ What do I deserve ♪

01:30:22.557 --> 01:30:30.565
Know that you matter, that you are
special and that you are loved.

01:30:36.137 --> 01:30:37.372
Life's meaningless
until you find

01:30:37.405 --> 01:30:38.707
what you're passionate about.

01:30:40.175 --> 01:30:44.579
And when you find it, you
found your reason for living.

01:30:46.381 --> 01:30:51.019
1-800-273-8255, somebody
will be there to talk to you.

01:31:00.561 --> 01:31:04.000
Hi, I'm Billy, I'm 17.

01:31:05.300 --> 01:31:08.971
I've been live
streaming this today

01:31:09.003 --> 01:31:10.672
because I figured it
could be the best way

01:31:10.706 --> 01:31:12.175
to get you all to watch.

01:31:23.786 --> 01:31:25.354
I found these videos online

01:31:25.386 --> 01:31:27.222
because they all shared
the same hashtag,

01:31:27.256 --> 01:31:28.423
WhenTodayEnds.

01:31:30.525 --> 01:31:32.494
My sister Megan
used that hashtag.

01:31:33.694 --> 01:31:36.564
She took her own life
two months ago today

01:31:36.597 --> 01:31:38.234
live on social media.

01:31:40.101 --> 01:31:42.337
She was bullied
online and in school.

01:31:49.310 --> 01:31:50.380
This is her room.

01:31:54.649 --> 01:31:56.885
My mom sits in there
everyday for hours.

01:31:58.353 --> 01:32:01.323
I can hardly come in here but
it's all I have left of her.

01:32:03.125 --> 01:32:06.127
I watched her last
video over and over.

01:32:06.161 --> 01:32:08.431
It's all I could do for
the last two months.

01:32:09.965 --> 01:32:13.002
When I watched Jenna,
James and Nicole's videos,

01:32:13.034 --> 01:32:15.171
I needed to know why they did it

01:32:16.604 --> 01:32:18.306
and why they all did it
live for millions to see.

01:32:19.774 --> 01:32:21.777
It was because they
knew you would watch.

01:32:23.244 --> 01:32:25.448
My own sister could do that
in front of the whole world

01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:27.349
but she couldn't tell
me how she really felt.

01:32:28.684 --> 01:32:30.019
I miss her everyday.

01:32:32.587 --> 01:32:33.422
I miss her.

01:32:38.926 --> 01:32:41.130
I don't know what would
make the pain go away.

01:32:41.162 --> 01:32:42.230
I don't know what to do.

01:32:49.971 --> 01:32:51.640
That was me just a year ago.

01:32:53.574 --> 01:32:57.646
I felt so alone, I
just wanted to give up.

01:33:00.148 --> 01:33:02.952
But then all these people
started watching my live stream

01:33:02.984 --> 01:33:06.188
and commenting and
sending me messages.

01:33:06.220 --> 01:33:08.457
All these strangers letting
me know I wasn't alone.

01:33:12.594 --> 01:33:17.432
I was overwhelmed by how many
people really cared about me,

01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:23.472
about my sister and I realized
we needed a place to connect.

01:33:25.606 --> 01:33:28.243
So I created an online channel

01:33:28.277 --> 01:33:31.212
and our mission is to change
the meaning of the hashtag,

01:33:31.246 --> 01:33:32.414
WhenTodayEnds.

01:33:34.917 --> 01:33:37.620
When today ends I'm gonna
pay for someone's next meal

01:33:37.653 --> 01:33:40.456
and spread smiles to every
passing person I see.

01:33:40.488 --> 01:33:43.424
When today ends I want
to make someone smile.

01:33:43.457 --> 01:33:46.427
When today ends I'm going
to compliment someone I love.

01:33:46.461 --> 01:33:49.265
When today ends, I'm
going to tell someone

01:33:49.297 --> 01:33:52.667
that they are not a
disappointment, not to me,

01:33:52.701 --> 01:33:56.438
not to anyone and certainly
not to themselves.

01:34:04.246 --> 01:34:06.981
When today ends, I'm
going to be there for you,

01:34:07.015 --> 01:34:08.851
I'm going to be there for
every person in the world

01:34:08.884 --> 01:34:11.554
that needs my help
because he's hurting,

01:34:11.587 --> 01:34:13.455
he's hurting deeply inside.

01:34:13.488 --> 01:34:15.791
- So let me tell you...
- When today ends...

01:34:15.823 --> 01:34:19.193
I'm going to
inspire people to...

01:34:26.935 --> 01:34:29.138

01:34:29.171 --> 01:34:33.909
