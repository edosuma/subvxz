Oh, my God,
Ali's with Charles. Cece?

'They never understood
how much I loved you.'

00:10.810 --> 00:13.074
You were like
my very own living doll.

00:13.180 --> 00:14.408
Cece is Charles?

00:14.510 --> 00:16.239
Does she think we came
between her and Ali?

00:16.350 --> 00:17.999
Is that what
this has all been about?

00:18.110 --> 00:19.668
Sara?

00:19.780 --> 00:22.544
Cece, please don't do this.

00:22.650 --> 00:24.140

Hey!

00:25.590 --> 00:26.511
'Don't do this!‘

00:26.620 --> 00:27.416
You've spent your whole life

00:28.190 --> 00:29.088

to your family.

00:29.190 --> 00:30.555
(in unison)
No!

00:33.560 --> 00:34.720
Game over.

00:34.830 --> 00:36.024
I heard that Sara

00:36.130 --> 00:37.358
got released
from the hospital today.

00:37.470 --> 00:39.438
What happened to Sara
that night wasn't our fault.

I can't believe_
we're actually leaVIng.

goodbye so hard.

hang a sign the bitch can see.

01:01.560 --> 01:03.323
(Spencer)
This is about betrayal?

01:03.430 --> 01:04.522
(Ashley)
It's not about
betrayal, Spencer.

01:04.630 --> 01:06.723
- It's about revenge.
- He knows we're lying.

01:06.830 --> 01:10.197
So stop pining for
the fjords and carpe hottie!

01:10.300 --> 01:11.289
(Spencer)
I know it's over.

01:11.400 --> 01:12.594

- And yes.

Dr. Rollins,
did we have an appointment?

02:16.600 --> 02:19.239
Ithought
I'd let you know in person.

02:19.340 --> 02:20.796
The judge set
a date for the hearing?

02:20.900 --> 02:23.232
- Yes.
- Thank you.

02:24.270 --> 02:26.135
Don't thank me yet.

02:26.240 --> 02:28.174
It's happening in four days.

02:28.280 --> 02:29.304
Four days?

02:29.410 --> 02:32.470
It was four days or six months.

02:34.950 --> 02:36.315
Alison?

02:36.420 --> 02:37.739
I want to enclose something

02:37.850 --> 02:39.181
in the court notifications.

02:39.290 --> 02:40.587
I can take care of that.

02:40.690 --> 02:41.714
Thank you.

02:43.930 --> 02:45.557
Alison, I have to remind you

02:45.660 --> 02:47.548
the court can compel
your friends to come

02:47.660 --> 02:49.764
but they may not be
sympathetic to the cause.

are we going to be under oath?

08:07.080 --> 08:09.878
You have to admit,

08:09.990 --> 08:11.981
I mean, a lot has happened,
good, bad and ugly

08:12.090 --> 08:15.014

was uncontaminated by "A."

on the fact I'm here?

- Right.
- How's Greg?

08:43.850 --> 08:46.648

- Why?

since we opened.

- But when Alison calls..
- It isn't Alison, mom.

10:07.740 --> 10:11.107
- It's the court.
- It's still Alison.

10:11.210 --> 10:13.804
She's been petitioning
the court to get Charlotte

10:13.910 --> 10:16.276
out of the hospital
since the day she was locked up.

10:16.380 --> 10:18.746
You don't owe Alison a thing.

10:18.850 --> 10:20.249
After what
that person did to you--

10:20.350 --> 10:22.887
Mom, I know what she did to me.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.811
And I know exactly
what I'm gonna say to the judge.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.888
Liam wanted you to have this.

10:30.990 --> 10:32.958
The James Tiptree short stories
you were talking about.

10:33.060 --> 10:35.028
- Is he trying to impress me?
- Yes.

10:35.130 --> 10:36.859
Well, he's off
to a very good start.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.790
He wants to know when
you're coming back to Boston.

10:38.900 --> 10:41.039
Not until the semester's over.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.729
How long are you staying?

10:43.840 --> 10:45.933
I just have to see how it goes.

10:48.180 --> 10:50.944
So what did you
think of the new Radley?

10:51.050 --> 10:53.211
Haven't seen it yet, but
I'm sure we'll get down there.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.810

and the other girls.

10:56.420 --> 10:59.309
No, we met at The Brew.
Old habits.

10:59.420 --> 11:01.183
The Brew?

11:01.290 --> 11:03.178
Yeah, that's right. Why?

11:03.290 --> 11:06.054
Did you see Ezra there?

11:06.160 --> 11:07.354
He's back.

11:07.460 --> 11:08.927
He still owns the place,
and I heard that

11:09.030 --> 11:11.726
_ he's moved _
Into the apartment upstairs.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.934
Ithought
he was still in South America.

11:16.040 --> 11:19.009
No, apparently, he got sick
and they sent him home.

11:19.110 --> 11:21.931
I haven't talked to him,
but I've seen him in town.

11:25.150 --> 11:28.813
- Did you know the girl?
- Nicole?

11:28.920 --> 11:30.342
I met her once.

They were down
there building houses.

11:38.930 --> 11:42.195
That's not supposed
to be controversial.

11:42.300 --> 11:43.164
Have you talked to him?

11:44.000 --> 11:47.936
No, I wrote him
a letter when Nicole..

11:48.040 --> 11:50.759
When it happened,
but I never heard back from him.

11:55.940 --> 12:00.877
(man on TV)
'Hastings for State Senate.
The clear, true voice.‘

12:00.980 --> 12:02.948
(Veronica on TV)
'I'm Veronica Hastings'

12:03.050 --> 12:05.245
'and I approve this message.‘

12:07.460 --> 12:08.882
The flag's a really nice touch.

12:08.990 --> 12:10.252
I never would
have thought of it.

12:10.360 --> 12:13.158
Don't be cynical, Spencer.

12:13.260 --> 12:13.897
Where's dad?

12:14.000 --> 12:16.889
In Harrisburg, raising money.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.264
The family that campaigns
together stays together.

12:19.370 --> 12:22.965
Your father is a champion arm
twister and we need the cash.

12:23.070 --> 12:24.833
It's an off-year special
election, winning might

12:24.940 --> 12:26.999
come down to
if it rains that day

12:27.110 --> 12:28.407
and people decide to stay home.

12:28.510 --> 12:30.046
Oh, now who's being cynical?

12:30.150 --> 12:31.503
It's your fault I'm doing this.

12:31.610 --> 12:34.977
You got involved in government
first. You inspired me.

12:35.080 --> 12:38.015
I watch the government, I keep
it honest. That's what I do.

12:38.120 --> 12:40.486
Sweetheart,
you work for a lobbyist.

12:40.590 --> 12:42.080
No, We are not lobbyists.

12:42.190 --> 12:44.420
We work with grassroots
political organizations

12:44.530 --> 12:46.259
to advance _
progresswe legislation.

12:46.360 --> 12:47.759
Mm-hmm?

12:48.960 --> 12:51.895
You're a lobbyist..

12:52.000 --> 12:54.889
...and your mother
is going to be

12:55.000 --> 12:57.139
a state senator.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.879
I'm so proud of you.

13:00.980 --> 13:05.440
* Day after day

13:05.550 --> 13:09.441
* Another comes falling down

13:09.550 --> 13:12.951
* Shaking the floor

13:16.560 --> 13:20.951
* Just yesterday

13:21.060 --> 13:24.791
* You were part of it all

13:28.200 --> 13:34.207
* All you hope to find *

13:39.110 --> 13:41.442
Your bosses
are very angry With me.

13:41.550 --> 13:42.949
They're not angry.

13:43.050 --> 13:45.848
They gave me
an advance on the second book.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.487
They know what happened
in South America.

13:48.590 --> 13:49.989
They understand.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.318
Well, then they're ahead of me

13:51.430 --> 13:55.252
because I don't understand
any of it.

13:55.360 --> 13:58.921
I_don't understand_how
a girl that I met in this shop

13:59.030 --> 14:00.292
who never hurt anybody

14:00.400 --> 14:02.937
can be dragged off
by half-baked revolutionaries

14:03.040 --> 14:06.100
and no one can seem to find her.

14:06.210 --> 14:09.998
So, if you understand
that, explain it to me.

14:12.050 --> 14:16.043
You go somewhere to help,
it shouldn't cost you your life.

14:25.060 --> 14:27.153
I'm sorry. Sorry.

14:30.230 --> 14:33.165
[whirring]

14:38.170 --> 14:39.262
H-hey!

14:43.310 --> 14:44.402
Hey!

14:49.020 --> 14:50.214
When did you get here?

14:50.320 --> 14:52.880
Uh, just a couple of hours ago.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.149
Wow!

14:57.190 --> 14:59.181
This is really impressive.

14:59.290 --> 15:02.657
I, I, uh, I just wanted to see
ifI could do it.

15:02.760 --> 15:04.569
How's it going?

15:04.670 --> 15:06.422
Ah, it's harder than I thought.

15:06.530 --> 15:09.567
I curse a lot. _
It's very therapeutic.

15:09.670 --> 15:11.001
How's Washington?

15:11.110 --> 15:15.535
Um, I curse a lot.
It's very therapeutic.

15:15.640 --> 15:17.369
Uh, Caleb said he saw you there.

15:17.480 --> 15:20.040
- Oh, yeah? You guys talk?
- Uh, now and then.

15:20.150 --> 15:22.243
We went, uh, we went
fishing last summer.

15:22.350 --> 15:23.510
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

15:23.620 --> 15:25.087
We're the Brotherhood
of Ex-boyfriends.

15:25.190 --> 15:27.249
We gotta stick together.

15:30.460 --> 15:32.655
So, you in town
for your mom's campaign?

15:32.760 --> 15:35.923
No, uh, I got a request

15:36.030 --> 15:37.190
from The State of Pennsylvania.

15:37.300 --> 15:39.063
They would like
my opinion on something.

15:39.170 --> 15:41.491
Ali's trying to get
Charlotte out of the hospital.

15:41.600 --> 15:45.229
Yeah. We're here
to talk to the court.

15:45.340 --> 15:46.602
We?

15:46.710 --> 15:48.371
Aria, Em, Hanna and me.

15:48.480 --> 15:51.244
All of you in one place
at one time.

15:51.350 --> 15:54.615
When's the last time
that happened in Rosewood?

15:54.720 --> 15:56.073
Long time.

15:56.180 --> 15:57.511
But when Alison flashes
the Bat Signal--

15:57.620 --> 15:59.645
It's not like that,
you know, we're still friends

15:59.750 --> 16:03.379
and we're not just, "Let's go
see a movie and have dinner"

16:03.490 --> 16:07.358
kinda friends, but the "I saved
your life, now you save mine"

16:07.460 --> 16:08.950
kinda friends.

16:09.060 --> 16:11.028
You know. You were there.

16:11.130 --> 16:12.620
How long are you
gonna be here for?

16:12.730 --> 16:15.233
Well, the hearing's
tomorrow, and then..

16:15.340 --> 16:17.205
...and then
I don't really know.

16:17.310 --> 16:21.508
Can I...buy you a dinner
before you leave?

16:21.610 --> 16:24.704
Yeah. Sure, we can do that.

16:24.810 --> 16:28.371
Um, I, I should go though.
I'm supposed to be meeting Ali.

16:28.480 --> 16:31.688
And I'm already late.
So, I'll call you, okay.

16:31.790 --> 16:33.018
Still the same number?

16:33.120 --> 16:35.179
- Same number.
- Cool.

16:37.790 --> 16:42.523
Toby, who are you
building the house for?

16:42.630 --> 16:46.122
What makes you think
I'm building it for somebody?

16:46.230 --> 16:48.698
Because I know you.

16:48.800 --> 16:52.065
[instrumental music]

16:59.380 --> 17:00.642
Charlotte is getting the help

17:00.750 --> 17:02.411
she never had
when she was little.

17:02.520 --> 17:06.149
Five years of treatment,
undoing all the damage.

17:06.250 --> 17:08.218
I visit her,
I spend time with her.

17:08.320 --> 17:11.551
She even stayed at my house
for a weekend last Christmas.

17:11.660 --> 17:15.050
- They let her out?
- It was a supervised visit.

17:15.160 --> 17:16.252
So Charlotte is all better now.

17:16.360 --> 17:18.419
What does this
have to do with us?

17:18.530 --> 17:21.533
At the hearing tomorrow,
the judge will decide

17:21.640 --> 17:23.437
if she should be released.

17:23.540 --> 17:27.032
'And they want to hear
from people who were involved.‘

17:27.140 --> 17:29.199
- Victim statements.
- Statements of support.

17:29.310 --> 17:32.438
_ Statements that
she isn't a threat to anybody.

17:32.550 --> 17:35.212
That you guys are not
afraid of her anymore.

17:39.320 --> 17:41.550
There is no reason to be afraid.

17:41.660 --> 17:43.252
'You know her.'

17:43.360 --> 17:45.658
You heard her story. We all
went through this together.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.796
Yes, we did.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.528
We have the scars
to prove it too.

17:50.630 --> 17:53.098
You're asking us to give
a get-out-of-jail-free card

17:53.200 --> 17:54.337
to someone who tried to kill us.

17:54.440 --> 17:56.294
She's in a hospital, Hanna.
She's not in jail.

17:56.400 --> 17:57.606
(Aria)
She's luclq.

17:57.710 --> 18:00.235
And we're lucky to be alive.

18:01.480 --> 18:04.199
That's why your statements
would mean so much.

18:04.310 --> 18:06.369
Who else is speaking?

18:07.350 --> 18:09.841
Mona demanded to be heard.

18:09.950 --> 18:11.486
She's going to talk
to the judge about

18:11.590 --> 18:13.717
the Dollhouse,
and being tortured.

18:13.820 --> 18:15.378
What about Sara Harvey?

18:15.490 --> 18:17.355
What about her?

18:17.460 --> 18:19.826
Well, suppose we do
talk to the judge..

18:19.930 --> 18:21.227
'...they march in Sara Harvey.‘

18:21.330 --> 18:22.524
She gives a few
choice words about

18:22.630 --> 18:24.359
what happened to her
that night at Radley?

18:24.470 --> 18:25.869
She's not allowed
to testify because of how

18:25.970 --> 18:27.665
her criminal charges
were resolved.

18:27.770 --> 18:29.658
Why isn't Jason here?

18:31.240 --> 18:33.674
He doesn't agree
with Dr. Rollins and me.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.806
Okay, you realize
what you're asking us to do.

18:36.910 --> 18:38.377
You want us
to forgive Charlotte.

18:38.480 --> 18:40.675
I don't care if you forgive her.

18:40.780 --> 18:43.419
I'm asking you to give me
my only chance at a real family.

18:43.520 --> 18:45.385
Alison, we're here
to say how we feel

18:45.490 --> 18:47.583
and you're asking us to lie.

18:47.690 --> 18:50.557
Please, do this.

18:50.660 --> 18:53.549
- Do this for me.
- Pretty please?

18:53.660 --> 18:55.491
- 'With sugar on top?‘
- What?

18:55.600 --> 18:58.763
That's what you say on
a playground to exact a favor.

18:58.870 --> 19:01.668
We're not on the playground
anymore, Alison.

19:01.770 --> 19:04.136
We haven't been for a long time.

19:06.610 --> 19:08.271
Please?

19:21.760 --> 19:24.149
I am not one of those candidates
who runs for office

19:24.260 --> 19:26.182
telling you how much
I hate the government

19:26.290 --> 19:27.826
'and wanna take it apart.‘

19:27.930 --> 19:31.593
Like you, I understand
that the size of the problem

19:31.700 --> 19:34.362
dictates the size
of the solution needed.

19:34.470 --> 19:37.860
If being honest and truthful
is so damn purifying..

19:37.970 --> 19:39.904
...why do I feel like
the bottom of somebody's shoe?

'Government does
the job that only'

19:49.720 --> 19:53.212
Our courts are not
the enemy of freedom.

19:53.320 --> 19:55.550
Look, they have the reports.

19:55.660 --> 19:57.753
Okay, they know what Charlotte
did to us when she was "A."

19:57.860 --> 19:59.725
We don't need to
talk about that.

19:59.830 --> 20:01.593
All we've to say
is that we're not afraid of her.

20:01.700 --> 20:05.261
That's all Ali wants. Then
we get the hell out of here.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.861
Is it the truth?
That we're not afraid?

20:07.970 --> 20:09.892
Maybe it is.
I mean, look at us.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.538
We did get away. We won.

20:13.640 --> 20:17.599
Maybe we didn't kill the dragon,
but we definitely tamed it.

20:17.710 --> 20:19.575
Um, I'll be right back.

well in the polls'

20:25.590 --> 20:28.252

20:28.360 --> 20:29.486
Hi, Mona.

20:29.590 --> 20:31.922
I waved at you
at the Kennedy Center reception.

20:32.030 --> 20:35.352
- You didn't see me.
- I'm sorry.

20:35.460 --> 20:37.223
Look at us, all this time

20:37.330 --> 20:39.594
and we both end up
in the same business.

20:39.700 --> 20:41.361
Um, not really.

20:41.470 --> 20:43.301
We both sell policy.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.230
Different kinds of policy.

I do.

of prescriptions

went out of sync.

It happens.

21:33.360 --> 21:36.716
I-I-I like this town,
but everywhere she went

21:36.820 --> 21:39.550
it was like she saw something
that she wanted to forget.

I wouldn't have pictured you
and Ali to be the ones to stay.

Took a while, mostly nights,
but I got it.

21:55.480 --> 21:58.870
Didn't do much good this year.

21:58.980 --> 22:01.517
Got passed over for promotion.

22:08.490 --> 22:12.358
College wasn't what I thought
it was gonna be.

I look at Aria,
Spencer and even Hanna

22:14.700 --> 22:16.588

22:16.700 --> 22:20.397
- Not for you?
- No.

22:20.500 --> 22:22.730
I had a hard time.

22:22.840 --> 22:25.866
When my dad died, I just
couldn't see a point to it.

is my sister Charlotte.

And now, I wanna bring
my sister home.

I'm sure that you've read
all of the documents

22:55.200 --> 22:58.863
about who Charlotte is,
and what she's done to us.

22:58.970 --> 23:00.904
Those are just reports.

23:01.010 --> 23:02.773
One thing that I've learned
from all this is that

23:02.880 --> 23:05.747
people are not always
the things that they do.

23:08.580 --> 23:11.378
Charlotte DiLaurentis
poses no threat to me.

23:15.760 --> 23:18.820
But now, every morning
I wake up..

...I drink coffee,
and I walk outside.

or it's raining, but there I am.

in the rain as I do.

No, I'm not afraid of her.

23:41.620 --> 23:44.646
My dad taught me
that fear is natural.

23:44.750 --> 23:47.184
It's a good instinct.

23:47.290 --> 23:48.587
'He also said
that you can decide'

23:48.690 --> 23:51.124
what you're going to
be afraid of.

23:51.230 --> 23:55.724
I decided I'm not afraid
of Charlotte DiLaurentis.

23:55.830 --> 23:58.765
Alison and Dr. Rollins
have told us

23:58.870 --> 24:02.033
how well Charlotte's been doing.

24:02.140 --> 24:05.837
How rapidly she's been
able to integrate herself

24:05.940 --> 24:08.807
into the General Hospital
population.

24:09.780 --> 24:11.441
They feel strongly that--

24:11.550 --> 24:13.711
[door opens]

24:13.820 --> 24:14.969
I'm sorry.

24:16.920 --> 24:18.478
[door closes]

24:21.090 --> 24:22.455
Miss Montgomery.

24:22.560 --> 24:23.788
Sorry.

24:25.290 --> 24:27.520
They feel strongly..

24:27.630 --> 24:29.154
...that now is the right time
for Charlotte--

24:29.260 --> 24:32.661
Miss Montgomery, I've read
the same reports that you have.

24:34.170 --> 24:35.569
Well, the doctors--

24:35.670 --> 24:37.604
The doctors
can speak for themselves.

24:37.710 --> 24:39.837
You're here to tell me
if you'd feel safe

24:39.940 --> 24:42.773
should Charlotte DiLaurentis
leave the hospital.

24:47.050 --> 24:49.871
[intense music]

24:49.980 --> 24:51.686
Miss Montgomery?

24:54.290 --> 24:56.611
[screaming]

25:03.900 --> 25:04.969
No.

25:07.070 --> 25:09.038
No, I would not feel safe.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.274
I was on the Redline

25:19.380 --> 25:22.508
going to Braintree..

25:22.620 --> 25:24.713
...and_ the train
stopped in the tunnel

25:24.820 --> 25:26.788
between the stations.

25:28.590 --> 25:32.526
The power went out
and, and it was dark.

25:32.630 --> 25:35.849
'No, not dark. It was black.‘

25:35.960 --> 25:38.667
'And I was back in every box'

25:38.770 --> 25:40.294
'in every dark tight space that'

25:40.400 --> 25:42.937
"A" ever put me in,
and I couldn't breathe.

25:45.940 --> 25:49.239
Then I heard a girl crying.

25:49.340 --> 25:53.879
Good. I thought somebody else
is scared out of her mind.

25:56.350 --> 25:59.945
Then...the power came back on

26:01.360 --> 26:03.180
and every single person
on that train

26:03.290 --> 26:05.053
was staring at me.

26:05.160 --> 26:07.697
Because I was the girl
that was crying.

26:09.830 --> 26:12.094
I don't want Charlotte released.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.092
Even

26:19.710 --> 26:22.031
Here comes the_last nail
in the coffin.

26:32.420 --> 26:36.049
I thought I could do this,
but I can't.

26:36.160 --> 26:38.185
I've been listening
to my friends

26:38.290 --> 26:40.997
how they've managed
to forgive Charlotte.

26:43.060 --> 26:46.689
I wish I could hate her,
but I can't.

26:46.800 --> 26:49.689
'I can't, because I know
what she went through.‘

26:51.270 --> 26:53.204
I was in Radley Sanitarium.

26:54.440 --> 26:56.874
I was there for months.

26:56.980 --> 27:01.371
Charlotte was there
for years and years.

27:01.480 --> 27:04.779
'Being in that place is what
twisted her all out of shape.‘

27:07.050 --> 27:09.052
Let her out.

27:09.160 --> 27:10.684
Let her go home.

27:10.790 --> 27:13.827
That's all any of us want.

27:13.930 --> 27:15.955
Is to have a home.

27:16.060 --> 27:17.220
I'm sorry.

27:21.240 --> 27:24.164
[instrumental music]

27:31.180 --> 27:34.775
Are you okay with this?

27:34.880 --> 27:36.939
It's a little bit strange.

27:37.050 --> 27:38.847
We can go somewhere else
when they get here.

27:38.950 --> 27:42.317
No, if you're gonna
chase away the demons

27:42.420 --> 27:45.184
you have to go
to where the demons are.

27:45.290 --> 27:47.758
You know who I thought was gonna
walk into that hearing room?

27:47.860 --> 27:49.828
- Who?
- Sara Harvey.

27:49.930 --> 27:51.124
They said that
she wouldn't be there.

27:51.230 --> 27:52.959
Or what if she did show up?

27:53.070 --> 27:55.664
We tell our little white lies,
and in she walks.

27:55.770 --> 27:57.089
"These bitches
are lying, Your Honor."

27:57.200 --> 27:58.736
"Wanna know what
they're really like?"

27:58.840 --> 28:00.660
"Let me show you
what they did to me."

28:00.780 --> 28:02.702
And she shows everybody.

28:02.810 --> 28:04.869
[cell phones ringing]

28:11.750 --> 28:13.388
So, that's that.

28:13.490 --> 28:15.811
The judge says
Charlotte can go home.

28:15.920 --> 28:18.081
Thanks for your help, Ali.

28:20.930 --> 28:22.955
_ [sighs]
Did you guys see?

28:23.060 --> 28:24.823
We saw.

28:24.930 --> 28:28.093
Everyone, say hello to
the only honest woman in town.

28:29.400 --> 28:32.107
- I'm sorry.
- No, we're sorry.

28:32.210 --> 28:34.235
(Spencer)
You're small,
but you are mighty.

28:34.340 --> 28:35.705
You put us all to shame.

28:35.810 --> 28:37.971
Alright, everyone
turn your phones off.

28:38.080 --> 28:40.048
Not silent, not vibrate, off.

28:40.150 --> 28:41.469
I can't turn my phone
all the way off.

28:41.580 --> 28:44.048
Spencer, one of the lifesaving
pieces of information

28:44.150 --> 28:45.242
I've learned
is that these things

28:45.350 --> 28:48.319
actually have an off button.

28:48.420 --> 28:49.978
Do it, Spencer.

28:51.460 --> 28:53.121
Okay!

28:53.230 --> 28:56.757

cocktails is now in se55ion.

(Spencer)
You know, if you didn't know
what this place was

29:12.980 --> 29:15.141
you'd never know
what this place was.

29:15.250 --> 29:17.343
Said the real estate agent
showing you around

29:17.450 --> 29:19.338
"The House On Haunted Hill."

29:21.260 --> 29:23.057
I miss your faces.

29:23.160 --> 29:27.119
You guys have
such excellent faces.

29:27.230 --> 29:29.391
Or we should plan on seeing
each other more often.

29:29.500 --> 29:32.060
Yes, but not here.

29:32.170 --> 29:34.434
Ugh, we can make a list
of beautiful cities

29:34.540 --> 29:36.098
and go to each one of them.

29:36.200 --> 29:38.100
And that can get expensive.

29:38.210 --> 29:40.428
Paris, Rome

29:40.540 --> 29:43.031
Madrid, Rio.

29:43.140 --> 29:45.199
We can party
in every one of them.

29:45.310 --> 29:48.768
And All and Charlotte
can sit in that big, ugly house

29:48.880 --> 29:51.041
and they can bake cookies.

29:54.060 --> 29:57.416
You'd think a place like this,
they'd have...special drinks.

29:57.520 --> 29:59.056
What kind of special drinks?

30:00.290 --> 30:02.099
We're sitting in a bar, in what
used to be a squirrel factory.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.998
But no, like,
an Electroshock Margarita?

30:05.100 --> 30:06.397
Manic depressive Mai Tai?

30:06.500 --> 30:09.799
You guys are seriously
lacking in any good taste.

30:09.900 --> 30:11.504
That's why I love you so much.

30:11.610 --> 30:13.999
I love each one of you.

30:14.110 --> 30:16.135
- Spencer loves us.
- So I heard.

30:16.240 --> 30:19.403
Hey, uh, can we
get another Bipolar Martini

'for my friend over here?‘

30:31.590 --> 30:33.251
Last call in Rosewood.

30:33.360 --> 30:35.954
Can we just
go someplace and dance?

30:36.060 --> 30:38.494
That's why
God invented the mini-bar, Em.

30:38.600 --> 30:40.295
We can go back to my suite.

of the evening.

wanna hear something funny?

30:54.220 --> 30:56.609
I'd love
to hear something funny.

I thought it wouldn't matter
what we said to the judge..

31:00.350 --> 31:02.853
...because I thought
they would never let her out.

31:05.260 --> 31:06.989
I thought that
we could just lie for All

31:07.090 --> 31:09.524
one more time
and it wouldn't matter.

31:09.630 --> 31:11.996
But it did.

31:12.100 --> 31:14.136
They let "A" out.

31:16.200 --> 31:19.499
Wouldn't it just
be the biggest cosmic joke ever

31:19.610 --> 31:22.329
if Charlotte gets
to live happily ever after?

If she can do it, so can we.

- Yup.

to your hotel room last night?'

Mm, no she didn't, what's wrong?

I don't know where she iS.

is here but She isn't.

to call the police.

Yeah, you should.

Can you call
the others and come over?

Yeah, I will,
but, Ali, don't wait.

- Call the police.
- 'Please hurry.‘

Checked the building,
went to the bell tower

and looked down.

the identification?

It's Charlotte DiLaurentis.

Stay with her
until she falls asleep.

34:44.850 --> 34:46.249
I will.

Are you alright?

If I thought
there was any chance

34:52.450 --> 34:55.089
of Charlotte
taking her own life, I..

I-I never would've let her

about working for her outfit.

and I didn't expect you
to Show up on my doorstep

36:14.940 --> 36:17.295
or anywhere else.

36:17.400 --> 36:19.265
Yeah, uh, Spencer
told me about Charlotte

36:19.370 --> 36:22.305
and, um...I don't know.

36:22.410 --> 36:23.900
Maybe it was
a conditioned reflex

36:24.010 --> 36:26.444
but...I thought I could help.

Well, I'm glad to know
that your reflexes still work.

kept our mouths shut

in a nice, safe hospital.

Instead, we have
another funeral to get through.

36:51.870 --> 36:54.873
Yeah. Ithought I might
stick around for that.

36:54.980 --> 36:58.302
Well, my mom can set you up
with a room here, if you want.

Uh, no, that's okay,
actually, um

- Are you still in New York?
