WE'RE GOING TO BE TOTALLY LATE
FOR MARY LOU'S SPEECH,

18:45.890 --> 18:47.517
AND WE'RE SUPPOSED TO LEAD
THE SLOW CLAP.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.482
JUST GO WITHOUT ME.

18:49.520 --> 18:50.657
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT.

18:50.690 --> 18:52.419
OKAY, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

18:52.460 --> 18:53.529
JUST OPEN THE DOOR.

18:53.560 --> 18:54.595
I'M COMING IN THERE.

18:54.630 --> 18:58.691
I'M NOT GOING TO THE MIXER,
BE'ITY.

18:58.730 --> 19:00.334
EVEN IF I WANTED TO,

19:00.370 --> 19:02.190
MY FINGERS AND TOES
ARE ALL PRUNEY NOW.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.662
EW.

19:11.580 --> 19:12.899
BIANCA, OPEN THE DOOR.

19:12.950 --> 19:14.417
THIS IS COMPLETELY
RIDICULOUS.

19:14.450 --> 19:15.747
[SCREAMS]

19:16.580 --> 19:18.684
[ELECTRICITY ZAPPING]

19:18.720 --> 19:19.709
HELLO?

19:19.750 --> 19:21.149
MARY LOU, IT'S BIANCA!
HELP!

19:38.510 --> 19:39.568
JULES?

19:49.620 --> 19:51.247
BE'ITY, IF YOU KNOW SOMETHING,

19:51.290 --> 19:53.281
YOU HAVE TO TELL
THE CHIEF HERE.

19:53.320 --> 19:54.651
WE ARE ALL
IN DANGER.

19:54.690 --> 19:56.282
ANY ONE OF US
COULD BE NEXT.

19:56.320 --> 19:59.653
I CAN SIT HERE ALL NIGHT,
BE'ITY.

19:59.690 --> 20:01.624
I'VE GOT
A SIX-MONTH-OLD

20:01.660 --> 20:02.991
WHO STILL HAS COLIC.

20:03.030 --> 20:04.918
I CONSIDER THIS A REPRIEVE.

20:05.830 --> 20:06.797
NOW...

20:06.830 --> 20:09.594
WHY IS YOUR FRIEND BIANCA DEAD?

20:15.010 --> 20:15.931
I CAN SEE IT.

20:15.980 --> 20:17.447
I CAN SEE HER
RUNNING

20:17.480 --> 20:18.845
DOWN THE HALLWAY
OF THE ASYLUM.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.472
WAIT A SECOND.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.545
DOREEN WASN'T
SUPPOSED TO DIE.

20:24.750 --> 20:25.717
THIS WAS
AN ACCIDENT.

20:25.750 --> 20:26.717
THE WOOD...
THE WOOD WAS RO'ITEN.

20:26.750 --> 20:27.751
THE LATCH BROKE.

20:27.790 --> 20:28.518
[GHOSTLY SHRIEKING]

20:28.560 --> 20:29.857
[BE'ITY]: YES, YES, IT BROKE!

20:29.890 --> 20:30.959
THAT'S IT. DON'T YOU SEE?

20:30.990 --> 20:32.958
WE NEVER MEANT FOR HER TO FALL!

20:32.990 --> 20:34.526
IT WAS A COMPLETE ACCIDENT!

20:34.560 --> 20:35.788
OH, MY GOD, BIANCA!

20:35.830 --> 20:36.990
WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO?

20:38.370 --> 20:40.361
OKAY, PLEASE, DO CONTINUE.

20:40.400 --> 20:42.265
OKAY, LIKE, IT WAS...

20:42.300 --> 20:44.666
IT WAS MY JOB
TO GET DOREEN INTO THE HOUSE.

20:44.710 --> 20:45.836
SHE KNEW THAT IT WAS A HAZE.

20:45.870 --> 20:46.939
SHE THOUGHT
THAT SHE WAS SUPPOSED

20:46.970 --> 20:48.039
TO SPEND
THE WHOLE NIGHT INSIDE.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.729
LIKE THAT MOVIE
WITH THE HEDGE MAZE

20:49.780 --> 20:50.747
AND VINCENT VAN PA'ITEN?

20:50.780 --> 20:51.747
HELL NIGHT.

20:51.780 --> 20:53.418
EXACTLY.

20:53.450 --> 20:54.542
BIANCA WAS INSIDE,

20:54.580 --> 20:56.741
WEARING THIS NIGHTGOWN,

THE NIGHTGOWN.

21:05.060 --> 21:06.357
PUT IT IN.

21:06.390 --> 21:08.426
GOD...

21:08.460 --> 21:10.599
[BE'ITY]: BIANCA BURIED IT
IN THE TAR PITS

21:10.630 --> 21:12.461
THREE NIGHTS AGO.

21:12.500 --> 21:13.728
TAR PITS?

21:13.770 --> 21:15.761
I KNOW, IT WAS REALLY GROSS
AND STICKY,

21:15.800 --> 21:19.031
BUT SHE WAS JUST SCARED.

21:19.070 --> 21:21.004
WE BOTH WERE.

21:21.040 --> 21:23.508
LOOK, IT WAS AN ACCIDENT,
I SWEAR TO GOD.

21:23.550 --> 21:24.676
BIANCA TRIED TO GRAB HER ARM,

21:24.710 --> 21:26.302
BUT IT WAS
TOO LATE.

21:26.350 --> 21:27.772
I MEAN, NOBODY
WAS SUPPOSED TO DIE!

21:27.820 --> 21:29.811
[SOBBING]

21:29.850 --> 21:31.511
NOW BIANCA'S GONE, TOO.

21:31.550 --> 21:32.642
YOU WITHHELD
EVIDENCE,

21:32.690 --> 21:34.578
AND BY CONSPIRING WITH BIANCA,

21:34.620 --> 21:36.485
WE CAN CHARGE YOU
WITH INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER.

21:38.430 --> 21:40.557
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT'S A CRIME?

21:41.960 --> 21:44.724
OH, GOD, NO!

NO!

[GROANS]

22:06.450 --> 22:08.008
YOU ACTUALLY
SLEPT HERE LAST NIGHT?

22:08.060 --> 22:09.482
YES, I DID.

22:09.520 --> 22:12.353
IT'S CALLED
CRUNCH TIME.

22:12.390 --> 22:13.391
DID YOU CHECK
THE MESSAGES?

22:13.430 --> 22:14.124
HAVE WE HEARD
FROM JULIET?

22:14.160 --> 22:15.491
YEAH.

22:15.530 --> 22:17.669
ALICE BUNDY'S
ALIBI'S AIR TIGHT.

22:17.700 --> 22:18.962
SHE LIVES WITH
DOREEN'S FAMILY.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.069
SAYS SHE WENT
UPSTAIRS TO BED

22:20.100 --> 22:21.362
EARLY THAT NIGHT,

22:21.400 --> 22:22.094
AND THE PARENTS
CONFIRMED IT.

22:22.140 --> 22:23.095
THEY WERE STILL
DOWNSTAIRS AWAKE

22:23.140 --> 22:24.402
WHEN THE POLICE
CALLED.

22:24.440 --> 22:25.634
WHO THE HELL
IS DOING THIS?

22:25.670 --> 22:28.070
OH, AND YOUR DAD CALLED.

22:28.110 --> 22:29.179
WHAT COULD HE POSSIBLY WANT?

22:29.210 --> 22:31.075
SAID HE WANTED TO REMIND YOU
ABOUT DINNER TONIGHT.

22:31.110 --> 22:33.101
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
BRING DESSERT.

22:33.150 --> 22:35.744
HE ACTUALLY SEEMED
SORT OF EXCITED.

22:35.780 --> 22:39.045
OH, GOD, THAT'S TONIGHT.

22:39.090 --> 22:39.909
DUDE, YOU HAVE TO COME.

22:39.950 --> 22:41.611
OOH, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT, SHAWN.

22:43.860 --> 22:44.952
I WOULDN'T WANT TO INTRUDE.

22:46.430 --> 22:47.499
GUS, HE LOVES YOU.
HE ALWAYS HAS.

22:47.530 --> 22:49.452
PLUS, IF YOU COME,
WE CAN ROLL EARLIER.

22:49.500 --> 22:50.660

WE'RE WORKING ON A CASE.

AM GOING TO GO FIND
ALICE "BEST FRIEND" BUNDY.

HAS BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH, SHAWN?

23:02.140 --> 23:05.507
GUS, THERE IS NO SUCH THING
AS AN AIRTIGHT ALIBI,

23:05.550 --> 23:06.699
AND IF THERE IS,

23:06.750 --> 23:07.819
WE'RE GOING TO PRETEND
LIKE THERE ISN'T.

23:07.850 --> 23:08.976

IS SHARON STONE

ANOTHER LEAD,

23:18.060 --> 23:19.425
WE ASSUME IT'S HER.

THE "HOW."

23:21.460 --> 23:23.428
SO FAR,
NO ICE PICK.

23:23.470 --> 23:24.698
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,

23:24.730 --> 23:27.062
DON'T EVER COMPARE MY BLACK ASS
TO GEORGE DZUNDZA AGAIN, OKAY?

23:27.100 --> 23:28.465

ASK THAT GIRL

ALREADY HAVEN'T?

NEITHER HERE NOR THERE.

23:38.950 --> 23:40.474
WHAT'S IMPORTANT

23:40.520 --> 23:42.738
IS THAT THIS BABY
IS 82% HAWAIIAN,

23:42.780 --> 23:44.884
AND I'VE GOT ALL Al-TERNOON.

23:44.920 --> 23:46.945

SO YOU'RE ANOTHER COP, THEN?

23:57.830 --> 23:59.593

NOT EVEN CLOSE.

23:59.630 --> 24:00.631

HINT...

24:08.610 --> 24:09.736
GREEN DAY THERE

24:09.780 --> 24:10.872
IS ABOUT TO EAT
SOME STONE.

24:14.520 --> 24:15.817

24:15.850 --> 24:17.647
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

24:17.690 --> 24:19.089

24:19.120 --> 24:20.144
PASS.

24:20.190 --> 24:21.748
OH, COME ON.

24:21.790 --> 24:24.054
I WAS TRYING TO BE COOL.

24:24.090 --> 24:26.024
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

24:26.060 --> 24:28.221
YOU WANT TO READ MY PALM?

24:28.260 --> 24:29.693
WOULD YOU LIKE
A LOCK OF MY HAIR?

24:29.730 --> 24:31.493
WHOA, ALICE.

24:31.530 --> 24:34.169
NOW, I CAN...
I CAN FEEL THAT YOU'RE HURTING--

24:34.200 --> 24:35.064
REALLY?

24:35.100 --> 24:36.863
CAN YOU FEEL THAT I'M HURTING?

24:36.900 --> 24:39.209
COME ON, PSYCHIC,
YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT,

24:39.240 --> 24:40.673
CAN'T YOU?

24:40.710 --> 24:41.870
DO YOU HAVE A BEST FRIEND?

24:41.910 --> 24:43.172
YEAH.

24:43.210 --> 24:44.177
UH, SINCE BIRTH, ALMOST.

24:44.210 --> 24:45.279
GREAT,

24:45.310 --> 24:48.143
SO THEN MAYBE YOU COULD
WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND THIS.

24:48.180 --> 24:50.580
DOREEN AND I
WERE CLOSER THAN SISTERS.

24:50.620 --> 24:53.509
HER PARENTS TOOK ME IN
WHEN I WAS SEVEN.

24:53.560 --> 24:54.754
SEVEN.

24:54.790 --> 24:55.814
THEY RAISED ME.

24:55.860 --> 24:57.111
WE DID EVERYTHING TOGETHER,

24:57.160 --> 24:59.253
AND THE ONE TIME
THAT I WASN'T THERE,

24:59.290 --> 25:01.622
THE ONE TIME I LET HER DOWN,

25:01.660 --> 25:03.525
AND NOW SHE'S GONE.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.090
I KNOW
IF ANYTHING HAPPENED TO GUS,

25:07.900 --> 25:09.265
I DON'T KNOW,
I'VE NEVER...

25:09.300 --> 25:10.289
I MEAN, I WAS...

25:10.340 --> 25:12.604
LOOK,

25:12.640 --> 25:15.074
DO YOU REALLY THINK
I KILLED THAT GIRL?

25:16.210 --> 25:17.279
DO YOU?

25:17.310 --> 25:20.575
I MEAN, I UNDERSTAND
YOUR SUSPICION AND EVERYTHING,

25:20.620 --> 25:22.315
BUT I'M BARELY HANGING ON HERE,

25:22.350 --> 25:23.988
AND I JUST DON'T THINK THAT...

25:26.290 --> 25:28.508
I'M NOT A MURDERER.

25:30.590 --> 25:32.148
WELL, I CERTAINLY HOPE NOT
FOR YOUR SAKE.

25:34.160 --> 25:34.819
SOMEONE CAME IN

25:34.860 --> 25:35.895
AND EMPTIED
THE CASH REGISTER

25:35.930 --> 25:36.851
WHEN I WAS IN THE BACK.

25:38.070 --> 25:39.128
YOU'RE NOT WRITING THIS DOWN?

25:39.170 --> 25:41.695
WHO'S GOT
THE ARTH RITIC THUMB HERE?

25:42.840 --> 25:45.729
I HITCHHIKED FROM JERSEY
TO HAVANA WHEN I WAS 19.

25:47.140 --> 25:48.232
FOR CRYING
OUT LOUD...

25:48.280 --> 25:51.204
THEY ALSO GOT AWAY WITH
ABOUT $60 WORTH OF RUMP ROAST.

25:51.250 --> 25:52.672
DON'T TRY TO SELL ME

25:52.710 --> 25:54.314
ON THAT NONSENSE,

25:55.920 --> 25:58.684
WHAT, DO YOU THINK THIS
IS MY FIRST SQUARE DANCE?

26:00.390 --> 26:02.255
HEY, HEY!

26:03.290 --> 26:05.258
GIVE ME YOUR GUN, LASSITER.

26:05.290 --> 26:07.850
I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE
THIS LI'ITLE PIG SQUEAL.

26:11.100 --> 26:12.761
HE'S THE VICTIM, GOOCHBERG!

26:12.800 --> 26:13.630
FINE! FINE!

26:13.670 --> 26:15.262
I'LL DO IT MYSELF!

26:18.810 --> 26:21.005
MARY LOU, WAIT!

26:24.910 --> 26:26.309
I TOTALLY ALMOST FORGOT
TO GIVE THIS TO YOU.

26:26.350 --> 26:28.170
WELL, WHAT IS IT, EDEN?

26:28.220 --> 26:29.915
I DON'T KNOW.

26:29.950 --> 26:31.110
IT WAS LEI-T ON THE STOOP,
LIKE...

26:31.150 --> 26:32.788
LIKE A LITTLE BABY ORPHAN.

26:36.220 --> 26:37.756
"GOD'S GIl-T IS FORGIVENESS.

26:37.790 --> 26:39.951
"PLEASE JOIN US
IN REMEMBERING OUR DAUGHTER.

26:39.990 --> 26:42.788
YOUR A'ITENDANCE
WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED."

26:42.830 --> 26:44.229
TONIGHT?

26:44.270 --> 26:46.295
HELLO! PLANS.

26:46.330 --> 26:47.297
BYE!

26:47.330 --> 26:48.797
BYE!

26:53.710 --> 26:54.699
WE REALLY...

26:54.740 --> 26:55.877
WE REALLY SHOULD BE GOING.

26:55.910 --> 26:57.639
OH, COME ON, GUYS...
SHAWN, STAY.

26:57.680 --> 26:58.749
YOUR CASE WILL STILL BE THERE.

26:58.780 --> 27:00.771
UH, THE SOONER WE CAN
CRACK THIS CASE AND MOVE ON,

27:00.820 --> 27:02.173
THE BE'ITER, BELIEVE ME.

27:02.220 --> 27:04.415
WELL, THIS WOULDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH

27:04.450 --> 27:06.213
THE WISPY SUNNY PINES SUICIDE,
NOW, WOULD IT?

27:08.090 --> 27:10.684
NO.
YES, SIR.

27:10.730 --> 27:11.685
OH...

27:11.730 --> 27:13.925
OOH, THE PLOT THICKENS.

27:13.960 --> 27:14.949
OKAY, IT'S TRUE.

27:15.000 --> 27:15.989
FINE.

27:16.030 --> 27:17.190
AND IT HITS A LITTLE
CLOSE TO HOME,

27:17.230 --> 27:18.219
SEEING AS HOW
WE WERE ACTUALLY THERE
