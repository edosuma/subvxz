WEBVTT

01:57.902 --> 01:58.735
No.

02:05.176 --> 02:06.811
Get your face up!

02:06.844 --> 02:07.812
- Leave her alone, man.
- Chad.

02:08.511 --> 02:09.080
Chad!

02:10.513 --> 02:11.648
- Hmm.
- No!

02:11.681 --> 02:12.449
Bingo!

02:12.482 --> 02:13.818
No, no, not...

02:15.452 --> 02:16.787
Would somebody help me,
please?

02:16.821 --> 02:17.554
Help!

02:17.587 --> 02:18.956
Help, help, help, please!

02:20.124 --> 02:21.959
- Please!
- Dude took Summer.

02:21.993 --> 02:23.426
Oh, that's a shame, man.

02:23.460 --> 02:24.661
I mean she wasn't really
gonna fuck you anyway.

02:24.694 --> 02:25.329
Wait!

02:25.363 --> 02:26.330
We... we gotta do something!

02:26.364 --> 02:27.731
- Do what? Man has a fucking gun!
- I can't sit...

02:27.765 --> 02:29.767
That is a weapon,
he will kill us.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.601
- Do you want to die, Neil?
- No, I don't want to die.

02:31.635 --> 02:33.104
Do you want to die a virgin,
Neil? I don't.

02:33.137 --> 02:34.972
I mean, I'm not saying
I'm a virgin, I'm just saying...

02:35.006 --> 02:36.073
Okay, look,
I've got to do something.

02:36.107 --> 02:38.175
But, like, Summer doesn't even
know you exist, man.

02:38.209 --> 02:39.576
- Don't be a hero.
- No.

02:40.744 --> 02:41.212
No, no.

02:43.613 --> 02:44.481
Shit!

02:49.486 --> 02:51.188
Rest in peace, Mr. Lincoln.

02:51.222 --> 02:53.723
You're a kind man
and a damn good bus driver.

03:00.998 --> 03:02.233
You just drive over
Mr. Lincoln?

03:02.266 --> 03:04.467
Ah, there's a chance, yeah.

03:07.805 --> 03:09.807
Alright, quick, grab me some
Coke and some Mentos.

03:09.840 --> 03:10.674
What the fuck?

03:10.707 --> 03:11.275
Where am I supposed to get
that from?

03:11.309 --> 03:13.144
I don't know, just do it!

03:13.177 --> 03:14.444
Shit!

03:16.579 --> 03:17.014
Here.

03:17.048 --> 03:17.949
Nice!

03:20.117 --> 03:21.218
Shit!

03:21.252 --> 03:22.219
Alright, grab the wheel,
grab the wheel!

03:22.253 --> 03:23.788
Fuck, no! I'm not grabbing
the fucking wheel!

03:23.821 --> 03:24.587
Yeah, you're gonna grab
the wheel.

03:24.621 --> 03:25.923
I need to get closer
to the van.

03:29.293 --> 03:30.194
Get me closer.

03:30.227 --> 03:31.796
I'm going!

03:34.765 --> 03:35.833
Out of the way!

03:41.906 --> 03:43.240
Oh, fuck!

03:59.290 --> 04:00.257
Oh, fuck!

04:00.291 --> 04:01.058
What the fuck, Neil!

04:01.092 --> 04:02.059
Are you fucking crazy?

04:07.597 --> 04:08.232
Fuck!

04:19.209 --> 04:19.810
Fuck!

04:22.113 --> 04:22.780
Shit!

04:39.196 --> 04:40.431
Please be okay.

04:40.464 --> 04:42.800
I just don't have time to look
for a new best friend right now.

04:53.844 --> 04:54.812
You're a hero!

04:54.845 --> 04:57.181
Yeah, that's my best mother
fuckin' friend!

04:57.214 --> 04:58.282
Way to go, bro!

05:00.284 --> 05:01.285
You're the man, Neil!

05:01.318 --> 05:03.720
You saved me, Neil.

05:03.754 --> 05:05.056
You know my name.

05:05.089 --> 05:06.123
Of course, I do.

05:07.291 --> 05:10.094
I've had my eye on you
for a while.

05:10.127 --> 05:12.595
You give me butterflies.

05:12.629 --> 05:14.031
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:14.065 --> 05:15.598
- Me?
- You.

05:19.103 --> 05:21.338
Now kiss me...

05:21.372 --> 05:24.141
...and...

05:24.175 --> 05:26.043
...and simultaneously
finger me.

05:26.944 --> 05:28.345
Your wish is my command.

05:29.814 --> 05:30.848
Perfect!

05:50.067 --> 05:51.235
Can you please fucking knock?

05:51.268 --> 05:51.969
Jesus!

05:52.002 --> 05:52.837
Relax needle dick.

05:52.870 --> 05:54.138
I just need to borrow
your charger.

05:54.171 --> 05:56.173
No, you're not gonna borrow it,
you're gonna fucking steal it.

05:56.207 --> 05:56.974
Virgin!

05:57.007 --> 05:58.976
Can you...
you just...

05:59.009 --> 06:01.212
Mom,
can I please get my own bathroom?

06:01.245 --> 06:04.081
It's like Neil's fucking
cum cave in there.

06:04.115 --> 06:05.816
First day of
school, are we all excited?

06:05.850 --> 06:07.351
Yeah, extremely.

06:07.384 --> 06:10.754
Dad, can you please fix
the lock on the bathroom?

06:10.788 --> 06:13.224
And Mom, Jaclyn keeps losing her
chargers and stealing mine.

06:13.257 --> 06:15.359
I will get the door fixed today,
I hope.

06:15.392 --> 06:15.993
Yeah.

06:18.229 --> 06:19.363
Oh, Mom, I'm spending the night
at Madison's tonight.

06:19.396 --> 06:21.432
Oh, yeah, can you rephrase that
as a question, please?

06:21.465 --> 06:22.867
And we don't eat this
as a...

06:24.368 --> 06:26.237
May I please sleep over
at Madison's?

06:26.270 --> 06:27.670
You may.

06:29.840 --> 06:31.142
Excuse me?

06:31.175 --> 06:31.976
Breakfast is served.

06:32.009 --> 06:33.110
Here we go, come on.

06:33.144 --> 06:34.845
Wait.

06:34.879 --> 06:36.247
Waffles again?

06:36.280 --> 06:38.849
Oh, man, I've got cacao banana
and saffron blueberry.

06:38.883 --> 06:39.716
I'm good, Dad.

06:39.749 --> 06:40.351
- Dad, I'm good.
- Oh, they're tasty.

06:40.384 --> 06:41.552
Dad, Daddy, I'm good, too.

06:41.585 --> 06:42.253
- I don't want waffles again.
- No, no, no, nobody's good.

06:42.286 --> 06:44.721
We're gonna sit down together

06:44.755 --> 06:46.223
and eat your father's delicious
breakfast as a family.

06:46.257 --> 06:47.324
Let's go.

06:47.358 --> 06:50.027
I mean even if it's only
for five second,

06:50.060 --> 06:50.895
that's what we're doing.
Understand?

06:50.928 --> 06:52.029
- Okay, Mom.
- Yes.

06:52.062 --> 06:52.863
- Alright, alright.
- Okay, good.

06:52.897 --> 06:54.064
Yes.

06:54.565 --> 06:55.966
- Here you go, dear.
- Thank you.

07:04.808 --> 07:05.776
You know this is really nice...

07:05.809 --> 07:06.343
I gotta go.

07:06.377 --> 07:07.178
I really gotta go.

07:07.211 --> 07:08.078
I'm sorry,
I'm gonna miss the bus.

07:08.112 --> 07:09.046
Do you remember
where you put my bike?

07:09.079 --> 07:11.115
- I stuck it in the garage...
- Thank you, Dad.

07:11.148 --> 07:12.249
- Okay, thank you,
- Love you, Mom.

07:12.283 --> 07:13.384
- Okay, love you guys!
- Love you, too.

07:15.486 --> 07:16.220
I have five seconds.

07:17.955 --> 07:19.089
Wait!

07:20.524 --> 07:22.359
You can find me, come on.

07:27.331 --> 07:27.932
Morning, Neil!

07:27.965 --> 07:29.433
Still riding the bus, huh?

07:29.466 --> 07:31.368
Yeah, keeping you employed,
Mr. Lincoln.

07:34.305 --> 07:37.141
Looks good, can I have some?

07:37.174 --> 07:39.009
Um, alright.

07:40.177 --> 07:41.178
I guess.

07:59.330 --> 08:00.331
Hey!

08:17.047 --> 08:19.049
Thank you. Bye, sweetie.

08:19.083 --> 08:19.984
Oh, my God.

08:20.017 --> 08:21.285
It's gonna be amazing.

08:21.318 --> 08:22.653
I know.

08:27.157 --> 08:29.560
Remember it is your senior year,

08:29.593 --> 08:33.297
so we are helping raise money
for the Shape-A-Wish Foundation.

08:33.330 --> 08:36.533
Please speak to me if you would
like to make a contribution

08:36.567 --> 08:38.736
or raise your hand
if you have any questions.

08:42.072 --> 08:43.974
Love the enthusiasm.

08:44.008 --> 08:45.409
Just a dying child.

08:46.310 --> 08:48.846
I'd say one thing I'd wish for
is for high school

08:48.879 --> 08:51.015
to finally be over.

08:51.048 --> 08:53.550
Yeah, you should make
the wish at eleven-eleven,

08:53.584 --> 08:55.286
save us all from this misery.

08:55.319 --> 08:57.354
Ionic bonds
are the kind of bond,

08:57.388 --> 08:58.489
the kind of chemical bond...

08:58.522 --> 09:01.091
Why would I waste my time
doing that?

09:01.125 --> 09:02.126
Why not?

09:02.159 --> 09:04.228
I know this kid in, uh,
Cambodia.

09:04.261 --> 09:05.296
He actually wished
for his village to have

09:05.329 --> 09:06.830
clean drinking water.

09:06.864 --> 09:07.865
It came true.

09:09.500 --> 09:11.869
So if anyone makes a wish
at eleven-eleven,

09:11.902 --> 09:13.504
it just comes true...

09:13.537 --> 09:15.039
What the hell
are we all still doing here?

09:15.072 --> 09:18.275
Well, maybe some of us
are here to learn, Neil.

09:18.309 --> 09:19.943
Are you getting something
from this?

09:19.977 --> 09:21.412
Covalent bonds,

09:21.445 --> 09:23.347
you don't have to worry about
using your math skills.

09:23.380 --> 09:24.481
There is a catch, though.

09:24.515 --> 09:25.883
What?

09:25.916 --> 09:27.017
The universe has to agree
with your wish.

09:27.051 --> 09:28.886
Something that only lasts
for about twenty-four hours.

09:28.919 --> 09:31.255
Everything resets the very next
night at eleven-eleven.

09:31.288 --> 09:33.924
Complex acids are the ones you
want to stay away from.

09:33.957 --> 09:36.327
Those are the ones that are
going to burn your face off.

09:36.360 --> 09:37.061
Look it up, man.

09:37.094 --> 09:38.095
Google don't lie.

09:38.128 --> 09:39.096
Binary acid...

09:40.397 --> 09:41.432
Sorry I'm late.

09:41.465 --> 09:42.333
Thank you, Summer.

09:42.366 --> 09:43.467
Back there, please.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.436
Combined together,

09:45.469 --> 09:49.306
they are dangerous and they
smell really bad.

09:49.340 --> 09:51.642
So you guys are both invited
to my birthday party tomorrow.

09:51.675 --> 09:53.277
- Awesome, you look nice.
- Thanks.

09:55.245 --> 09:57.915
...on page 340,
we'll be looking at the evolution...

10:05.989 --> 10:07.558
- 'Sup, guys.
- What's up?

10:07.591 --> 10:09.426
Yo.

10:09.460 --> 10:11.662
So did you hear your girl Summer
is having a party this weekend?

10:11.695 --> 10:13.897
- Everyone's talking about it.
- Mm-hmm.

10:13.931 --> 10:14.631
Hey, Madison.

10:15.132 --> 10:17.334
- Hi.
- How you doing?

10:17.368 --> 10:21.071
I might have heard something
about that, yeah.

10:21.105 --> 10:22.339
So are you gonna go?

10:22.373 --> 10:24.475
Not invited... yet.

10:24.508 --> 10:25.509
Yeah.

10:26.377 --> 10:27.578
Why don't you just ask,

10:27.611 --> 10:30.080
because I did
and I got a pineapple.

10:31.382 --> 10:32.649
I'll think about it.

10:32.683 --> 10:34.518
Neil,
she might actually like you.

10:34.551 --> 10:35.519
But how would you know?

10:35.552 --> 10:37.187
You've literally never talked
to her before

10:37.221 --> 10:40.023
or made any contact whatsoever.

10:40.057 --> 10:42.192
What's the worst you think
could happen?

10:42.861 --> 10:44.027
That's actually
really good advice.

10:44.061 --> 10:45.396
I'm gonna take your advice.

10:45.429 --> 10:48.031
Maddy, would you like
to my girl for cuffing season?

10:48.065 --> 10:49.199
You wish.

10:49.700 --> 10:50.467
Yeah, she wants me.

10:50.501 --> 10:51.735
Oh, my God.

10:51.770 --> 10:54.605
You know I hate to agree with
Jaclyn, but she's right, man.

10:54.638 --> 10:55.973
Just do it.

10:56.006 --> 10:57.141
I'm serious,
just go over there and ask.

10:57.174 --> 10:58.075
Let's just try it,
me and you.

10:58.108 --> 10:59.576
We've got this.

10:59.610 --> 11:00.944
No, I'm not gonna go over there
and ask her for anything.

11:00.978 --> 11:01.545
Come on, man.

11:01.578 --> 11:02.679
I'm... I'm dead serious.

11:02.713 --> 11:04.214
Come on, come on, Neil.

11:04.248 --> 11:05.616
Come on, come on, you've got to
take the risk.

11:05.649 --> 11:07.184
No, dude,
what am I gonna say to her?

11:07.217 --> 11:07.852
Neil, you're over thinking it.

11:07.886 --> 11:09.219
Just breathe, just breathe.

11:09.253 --> 11:10.954
I can't,
I have nothing to say.

11:10.988 --> 11:11.522
I think I...

11:11.555 --> 11:12.589
Uh, hey, Summer.

11:12.623 --> 11:14.224
Yes.

11:14.258 --> 11:15.259
Uh, my friend Neil would like
to ask you a question.

11:16.260 --> 11:17.361
Okay.

11:19.263 --> 11:21.098
Um, I...
I was just gonna say...

11:21.766 --> 11:22.566
Oh, my...

11:37.448 --> 11:39.383
So, Ava, do you want to be
my girl for cuffing season?

11:51.528 --> 11:53.263
I don't want to see anyone
right now.

11:54.498 --> 11:56.467
Yeah, I know,
but Gilbert's here.

11:56.500 --> 11:58.535
Great, I said I don't want to
see anyone right now...

11:58.569 --> 12:01.171
Too bad now,
I'm already here.

12:01.205 --> 12:02.172
See ya later, guys.

12:02.206 --> 12:03.540
Looking good, Mrs. Tobbler.

12:03.574 --> 12:04.708
I don't feel like dancing.

12:11.081 --> 12:13.083
<i>That's right, good dance!</i>

12:13.116 --> 12:14.117
I can't do it, man.

12:14.151 --> 12:15.519
I can't go back to school.

12:15.552 --> 12:17.287
<i>And left.</i>

12:17.321 --> 12:18.489
I need to go in like the witness
protection program or something

12:18.522 --> 12:19.189
and get a new identify.

12:19.223 --> 12:20.657
I can't...
I can't handle it.

12:20.691 --> 12:22.025
<i>You've got this.</i>

12:22.059 --> 12:23.627
Well look, as your real friend,

12:23.660 --> 12:25.128
quite frankly, your only friend.

12:25.162 --> 12:26.029
You're not my only friend.

12:26.063 --> 12:26.597
<i>Alright now.</i>

12:26.630 --> 12:27.765
Who's your other friend?

12:27.799 --> 12:29.099
Uh, Brad.

12:29.132 --> 12:30.802
- Brad from preschool?
- Yeah.

12:30.835 --> 12:33.203
Yeah, cool, so as your only
friend I'm always gonna keep it

12:33.237 --> 12:34.404
a hundred, man.

12:34.438 --> 12:36.106
I'm not gonna act like today
wasn't actually rock bottom,

12:36.139 --> 12:37.674
which it was.

12:37.708 --> 12:39.209
I mean, I'm actually here
on suicide watch.

12:39.243 --> 12:40.677
I don't want to see you
hang yourself with some

12:40.711 --> 12:42.446
plastic bag from the ceiling fan
or some shit.

12:42.479 --> 12:43.547
I've seen that shit
on YouTube.

12:43.580 --> 12:44.515
That shit ain't pretty.

12:44.548 --> 12:46.049
Appreciate it.

12:46.083 --> 12:47.417
You're... you're really helping
me to feel better.

12:47.451 --> 12:50.087
What's the one thing we learned
from eighteen "Rocky" movies?

12:50.120 --> 12:53.223
Um, Rocky never threw up
on his dream girl?

12:53.257 --> 12:54.525
No.

12:54.558 --> 12:56.393
It's not about how hard you
get hit.

12:56.426 --> 12:58.195
It's about how quick
you get back up.

12:58.228 --> 13:00.798
<i>And move, and move.</i>

13:01.665 --> 13:03.200
<i>You are excellent!</i>

13:03.233 --> 13:05.369
This is too hard a hit to come
back from, man.

13:05.402 --> 13:06.771
I'm never gonna get invited
to a party now.

13:06.804 --> 13:08.605
No.

13:08.639 --> 13:10.407
I'm not gonna get invited
anywhere near her ever again

13:10.440 --> 13:11.108
most likely, like ever.

13:11.141 --> 13:12.743
Ever's a long time. Not ever.

13:12.777 --> 13:13.677
No, like for eternity,
like ever.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.078
Come on, man, no.

13:15.112 --> 13:16.680
No, like the afterlife
and thereafter.

13:16.713 --> 13:17.514
- No.
- Yeah.

13:17.548 --> 13:18.682
- No.
- Yeah.

13:18.715 --> 13:19.516
<i>Come on, team!</i>

13:19.550 --> 13:20.217
No!

13:20.250 --> 13:20.919
That's what I'm saying, yeah.

13:20.952 --> 13:22.319
It can't be that bad, man. No.

13:22.352 --> 13:23.086
Yes, it's that bad.

13:23.120 --> 13:24.288
- Yes.
- No.

13:24.321 --> 13:25.088
- Yeah.
- No.

13:25.122 --> 13:25.556
- Yeah.
- No.

13:25.589 --> 13:26.223
- Yeah.
- No.

13:26.256 --> 13:26.657
- Yeah.
- No.

13:26.690 --> 13:27.524
- Yeah.
- No.

13:27.558 --> 13:28.559
- Yes.
- Yeah, you're probably right.

13:28.592 --> 13:29.560
You guys should ache.

13:29.593 --> 13:30.260
It's bad.

13:36.400 --> 13:39.169
Every time I see my neighbour,
he's in a different Porsche

13:39.202 --> 13:40.872
with a different woman.

13:40.905 --> 13:42.739
That is a lot of ass
for one man.

13:43.808 --> 13:44.308
Damn.

13:47.411 --> 13:49.746
I just can't compete
with guys like Chad and Matt.

13:51.816 --> 13:53.183
We have different market
shares.

13:53.216 --> 13:55.485
They... they get hot girls

13:55.519 --> 13:59.256
and I get passwords
to Premium Pornhub.

13:59.289 --> 14:01.325
What you need to do is you need
to stop being stingy

14:01.358 --> 14:03.293
and pass us some Pornhub,
because I want to watch

14:03.327 --> 14:04.328
Premium porn, too.

14:04.361 --> 14:06.730
That's so surprising.

14:19.343 --> 14:21.111
I just wish someone thought
I was cool.

14:29.386 --> 14:31.856
Did you ever think your life
would be... would be different

14:31.889 --> 14:34.558
if you were...

14:34.591 --> 14:37.461
...Bill Gates'
or Steve Jobs' son,

14:37.494 --> 14:39.596
like, someone that mattered
in the universe or...

14:39.630 --> 14:40.932
or actually did cool shit.

14:40.965 --> 14:41.833
Th... that's your problem.

14:41.866 --> 14:43.768
It's not always
about the money, Neil.

14:46.403 --> 14:47.772
Although,

14:47.805 --> 14:49.774
if we're talking about it,

14:49.807 --> 14:51.508
I would like to be
Elon Musk's son.

14:51.541 --> 14:52.944
That's what I'm saying.

14:52.977 --> 14:54.544
I'd even suck your dick if it
meant I could be his son.

14:54.578 --> 14:56.213
Like that's my level of
commitment, man.

14:56.246 --> 14:57.849
So you think
there is an actual scenario

14:57.882 --> 15:00.785
where you sucking my dick
will lead to Elon Musk

15:00.818 --> 15:02.486
being your father?

15:02.519 --> 15:03.387
I don't know, man.

15:03.420 --> 15:05.522
The universe works
in mysterious ways.

15:05.555 --> 15:07.491
Never underestimate
the power of a good dick suck.

15:07.524 --> 15:09.393
I think we both spent most
of our lives thinking about

15:09.426 --> 15:11.561
the power of a good dick suck.

15:12.462 --> 15:13.397
You mean like giving one?

15:13.430 --> 15:15.232
'Cause that's not
what I'm talking about.

15:15.265 --> 15:16.500
See it's not the same thing.

15:16.533 --> 15:18.502
See I don't think
we're on the same page.

15:18.535 --> 15:21.471
No, I don't think I would know
how to give one, honestly.

15:24.374 --> 15:26.243
My dentist says
I gag too easily, anyway.

15:29.446 --> 15:30.815
Can I be honest with you, man?

15:32.649 --> 15:33.918
What's that?

15:33.951 --> 15:36.520
Summer and I would be lucky to
suck your dick.

15:38.288 --> 15:39.690
I mean it.

15:39.723 --> 15:41.491
Thank you.

15:41.525 --> 15:43.727
If it were up to me,
I would knight you,

15:43.761 --> 15:45.228
and then suck your dick.

15:46.496 --> 15:48.532
You know what?

15:48.565 --> 15:50.434
I was thinking that we'd go to
this really nice

15:50.467 --> 15:51.368
fast food restaurant.

15:51.401 --> 15:52.904
- Good night.
- Good night.

15:52.937 --> 15:54.237
You know how I like seafoods.

16:24.434 --> 16:26.904
<i>Today was kind of a rough day,</i>

16:26.938 --> 16:29.539
<i>but hopefully
tomorrow will be better.</i>

17:17.888 --> 17:19.689
Neil, wake up!

17:20.892 --> 17:22.960
Neil, you're gonna be late
for school!

17:25.863 --> 17:26.596
Neil!

17:31.969 --> 17:33.603
Yeah, you have something like
truffles and fish

17:33.637 --> 17:34.972
Hmm.

17:35.006 --> 17:36.941
- Uh, see ya kid.
- Have a great day!

17:36.974 --> 17:37.975
Wait!

17:38.009 --> 17:38.943
Wait!

17:38.976 --> 17:40.978
Wait!

17:41.012 --> 17:42.280
Wait!

17:54.524 --> 17:58.095
<i>Frienemies, who, when you're
down, ain't your friend</i>

17:58.830 --> 18:01.398
Dude, I barely slept last night.

18:01.431 --> 18:03.533
I feel like a dumb ass moron
piece of shit loser

18:03.567 --> 18:04.802
who should just off himself.

18:06.804 --> 18:07.939
Cool story, bro.

18:08.840 --> 18:10.875
Gilbert, where you going?

18:14.578 --> 18:15.412
What the fuck?

18:36.100 --> 18:37.734
Fuck!

19:10.935 --> 19:12.803
Sweet baby Jesus!

19:17.842 --> 19:18.876
Mm.

19:25.850 --> 19:27.084
Okay.

19:30.888 --> 19:32.622
- Hey, Neil.
- Hey, man.

19:32.656 --> 19:33.523
Hey.

19:34.158 --> 19:35.226
How are you?

19:35.259 --> 19:36.426
Hello.

19:37.661 --> 19:38.561
Hey, how's it going?

19:38.595 --> 19:39.931
Hey, man.

19:39.964 --> 19:41.531
What's up, guys?

19:41.564 --> 19:43.067
- Yo man.
- Hi.

19:43.100 --> 19:44.201
Hello.

19:46.037 --> 19:47.872
Gilbert,

19:47.905 --> 19:48.873
you're never gonna
believe this,

19:48.906 --> 19:50.540
'cause it's fucking crazy,

19:50.573 --> 19:52.910
but I'm Neil.

19:52.944 --> 19:55.146
Yeah, and I'm fucking
Chris Rock, man.

19:55.179 --> 19:56.981
Now dude, I'm serious,
I'm Neil.

19:57.014 --> 19:59.016
And I'm for real
I'm Biggie Smalls.

19:59.050 --> 20:00.017
I'm not fuckin' around,
Gilbert.

20:00.051 --> 20:01.618
I'm Neil.

20:01.651 --> 20:02.619
Yeah, I'm fuckin' James Brown
back from the dead.

20:03.586 --> 20:04.088
Get the fuck outta here, man.

20:07.524 --> 20:10.094
I would like to knight you
and then suck your dick.

20:17.268 --> 20:18.635
It will be my honour.

20:25.009 --> 20:26.978
Go ahead, ask me any question
that only Neil would know

20:27.011 --> 20:28.012
the answer to.

20:28.045 --> 20:28.879
Yeah, but it wouldn't even
matter...

20:28.913 --> 20:30.247
- 'cause you don't know shit.
- I do.

20:30.281 --> 20:31.282
You're not gonna know
any of these fuckin' answers, man.

20:31.315 --> 20:32.116
- I know everything about you.
- Alright, fine.

20:32.149 --> 20:34.151
What's the all time
beat off record?

20:34.185 --> 20:35.252
Eleven and a half times.

20:37.687 --> 20:38.756
Lucky guess.

20:40.791 --> 20:41.691
My first crush.

20:41.725 --> 20:42.860
Sadly, it's my mom.

20:42.893 --> 20:43.727
Yeah, it... it's wrong,

20:43.761 --> 20:44.829
because it's Neil's mom.

20:44.862 --> 20:45.796
That's my mom.

20:45.830 --> 20:46.397
Neil's mom actually wants to
have a threesome

20:46.430 --> 20:46.964
with me and Neil's dad.

20:46.998 --> 20:48.698
Next fucking question.

20:49.834 --> 20:51.902
If I were to make a rap group,
what would be the name of it?

20:51.936 --> 20:53.237
The Beverly Gil Billies.

20:53.270 --> 20:54.704
Name my solo artist.

20:54.738 --> 20:56.073
G-String Fully Unloaded.

20:56.107 --> 20:58.309
My favourite country
to travel to.

20:58.342 --> 21:00.044
The Italian section of Pornhub.

21:00.077 --> 21:01.578
Who did I lose my virginity to?

21:03.047 --> 21:03.948
Neil can draw.

21:03.981 --> 21:05.282
Okay.

21:05.316 --> 21:06.616
He-he's basically like
Picachio or some shit.

21:06.649 --> 21:07.852
Yeah, it's true, Picasso, so.

21:07.885 --> 21:09.020
Whatever, whatever.

21:09.053 --> 21:10.054
Draw me.

21:10.087 --> 21:11.055
What do you mean, draw you?

21:11.088 --> 21:12.655
Prove to me that you're Neil.

21:12.689 --> 21:13.991
Draw me like Jack
and I'll be your Rose.

21:14.025 --> 21:15.725
- What, like in Titanic?
- Yeah, like Titanic.

21:15.760 --> 21:17.161
- You've never seen Titanic.
- It doesn't matter.

21:17.194 --> 21:17.727
I've seen her titties.

21:17.762 --> 21:18.728
That's all that matters.

21:18.763 --> 21:19.897
Okay, so you want me to paint
your titties.

21:19.930 --> 21:21.631
- Want me to draw your titties?
- If that's what it takes.

21:21.664 --> 21:22.732
Gilbert!

21:24.634 --> 21:26.937
Have you seen Neil today?

21:26.971 --> 21:28.139
He didn't show up
at school.

21:30.607 --> 21:32.009
Who the fuck are you,
petterass?

21:34.945 --> 21:36.781
This is really fuckin' weird.

21:36.814 --> 21:38.149
Um, don't be jealous.

21:38.182 --> 21:39.817
You can be next
if you want to be.

21:39.850 --> 21:41.185
- I am not jealous.
- You just gotta ask.

21:41.218 --> 21:42.887
Get up.

21:42.920 --> 21:44.021
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Leave me the fuck alone.

21:44.055 --> 21:45.856
You're fuckin' letting
a complete stranger draw you.

21:45.890 --> 21:46.556
What...

21:52.763 --> 21:54.198
I mean it's like looking
in a mirror.

21:55.698 --> 21:57.334
Beauty is definitely in the eye
of the beholder,

21:57.368 --> 21:58.302
'cause that looks nothing
like you.

21:58.335 --> 21:59.702
Why... why can't you just
appreciate good art?

21:59.736 --> 22:00.637
Like what... what is your
problem?

22:00.670 --> 22:02.807
Wait, wait,
we can compare the drawings.

22:02.840 --> 22:03.974
Com... compare the drawings
with...

22:04.008 --> 22:05.176
Yeah.

22:05.209 --> 22:06.243
Do you think you're on CSI
or some shit?

22:06.277 --> 22:07.945
What the fuck is wrong with you?

22:07.978 --> 22:09.346
No, do you think that you look
like a drawing or some shit?

22:09.380 --> 22:10.247
Um, I sure do.

22:10.281 --> 22:11.681
Um...

22:11.714 --> 22:12.383
We're not...
we're not looking in my iPad.

22:12.416 --> 22:13.417
It's just a quick scan, alright?

22:13.451 --> 22:14.285
- It's my brother's iPad.
- Final test, I promise.

22:14.318 --> 22:15.419
You know I'm sensitive
about my work.

22:15.453 --> 22:18.355
It's my brother's iPad, so I can
look at it if I want.

22:18.389 --> 22:19.090
It's my iPad.

22:19.123 --> 22:20.024
Why do you...-
Seriously, get...

22:20.057 --> 22:21.358
Oh...

22:21.392 --> 22:22.725
- You're not touching my iPad.
- Stranger Danger!

22:23.294 --> 22:24.128
God!

22:24.161 --> 22:25.963
Fuck!

22:25.996 --> 22:27.198
Fine, quick scan only.

22:27.231 --> 22:28.299
Yep.

22:28.332 --> 22:30.367
- That is what I plan to do.
- Jesus!

22:34.737 --> 22:36.073
Oh, wow, who is that?

22:37.975 --> 22:39.944
"The water is so nice and hot."

22:41.078 --> 22:42.645
- "So is my pussy."
- "So is my pussy."

22:42.679 --> 22:43.314
Wow.

22:45.682 --> 22:46.951
"Take this Game of thrones!"

22:47.852 --> 22:50.321
"And after I want
game of bones."

22:51.055 --> 22:51.688
The fuck?

22:53.190 --> 22:55.392
"I'm coming for your
planet, hero!"

22:55.426 --> 22:57.694
"I'm gonna own
your face dickhead."

22:57.727 --> 23:00.197
"Hope your dickhead
owns my face, Neil."

23:00.231 --> 23:01.232
Creative.

23:01.731 --> 23:03.300
- "Be careful with my pussy."
- That's cute.

23:05.302 --> 23:07.371
Doesn't that kind of look
like...

23:07.404 --> 23:08.939
Fuck, it does.

23:12.943 --> 23:14.145
Do you believe me?

23:14.178 --> 23:15.846
Are we on the same page?

23:15.880 --> 23:17.181
Can you help me out?

23:17.948 --> 23:19.850
Alright, just making
an Insta profile for you, man.

23:19.884 --> 23:21.752
We've got to keep striking
while the iron is hot.

23:21.785 --> 23:22.820
What's your cool new name
for social purposes?

23:22.853 --> 23:23.988
Don't say Neil.

23:24.021 --> 23:25.055
What's wrong with Neil?

23:25.089 --> 23:26.757
Well, it's nerdy.

23:26.790 --> 23:27.958
You know, it doesn't really fit
with the image right now.

23:27.992 --> 23:28.893
No, it does not.

23:28.926 --> 23:30.027
Give me a name, I need a name.

23:30.060 --> 23:30.828
- Greg.
- No.

23:30.861 --> 23:31.428
- Vincent.
- No.

23:31.462 --> 23:32.263
- Arnold.
- No.

23:32.296 --> 23:32.997
- Hernandez.
- No.

23:33.030 --> 23:33.564
- Fred.
- No.

23:33.597 --> 23:35.266
- You're Ace.
- Ace.

23:35.299 --> 23:36.400
No, Ace is terrible.

23:36.433 --> 23:37.168
No, no it's not.

23:37.201 --> 23:39.303
Like Ace Ventura,
Pet Detective.

23:39.336 --> 23:40.703
The greatest film of all time.

23:40.737 --> 23:41.939
What are you talking about?

23:41.972 --> 23:44.041
Listen, I'll cover for you
with Mom and Dad

23:44.074 --> 23:45.776
until we figure out whatever
the fuck is happening

23:45.809 --> 23:47.411
to your body.

23:47.444 --> 23:50.114
Well, my future girl, Ava,
has a gig at the Rusty Records

23:50.147 --> 23:50.981
in an hour.

23:51.015 --> 23:51.815
Yeah.

23:51.849 --> 23:53.050
Stalker.

23:53.551 --> 23:55.452
Well, Summer will probably be
there, too.

23:55.486 --> 23:56.253
Really?

23:56.287 --> 23:57.488
Mm, yeah come on,

23:57.521 --> 23:58.556
we've got to get you
some new clothes,

23:58.589 --> 24:00.723
because right now
you're a ten in two's clothing.

24:00.758 --> 24:02.459
Who do you think you are,
Anna Wintour?

24:02.493 --> 24:03.460
Who the fuck is that?

24:07.064 --> 24:09.133
Yo, yo, this is your boy Gilbert
and I'm here to introduce

24:09.166 --> 24:11.468
my new best friend,
Ace, the actor, the model,

24:11.502 --> 24:12.503
the artist.

24:12.536 --> 24:14.471
Yo, Ace tell
the people about it.

24:14.505 --> 24:16.006
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:16.040 --> 24:17.942
Me... me and Gilbert,
we've been best friends since

24:17.975 --> 24:19.476
forever and...

24:19.510 --> 24:21.045
Yeah, so what did you even
wish for?

24:23.480 --> 24:25.282
Second chance with Summer.

24:25.316 --> 24:26.951
Second chance?

24:26.984 --> 24:29.253
Well, what kind of soft basic
shit is that?

24:29.286 --> 24:31.922
You guys could help yourself to
some gum or water or Binaca.

24:33.357 --> 24:34.458
Are you famous, by the way?

24:34.491 --> 24:36.126
No, man. No, I'm not.

24:36.160 --> 24:37.127
Yeah, yeah,
I'm not talking to you, pal.

24:37.161 --> 24:39.163
You have the face of someone
who's not famous.

24:39.196 --> 24:40.497
I'm talking to your
hot friend over there,

24:40.531 --> 24:42.800
that white, steamy cream puff
next to you.

24:42.833 --> 24:44.335
No, me? No, no.

24:44.368 --> 24:45.236
No, I'm not famous.

24:45.269 --> 24:46.537
Well, you could be.

24:46.570 --> 24:47.438
I'm not gay, but my girlfriend
and I are looking

24:47.471 --> 24:48.472
for a third, so.

24:48.505 --> 24:49.773
Face like that...

24:50.507 --> 24:51.408
...booty!

24:51.442 --> 24:53.811
What so, I... I don't have
that look, bro?

24:53.844 --> 24:55.512
Yeah, you have a face,
but it's like a,

24:55.546 --> 24:57.381
like a moon pie.

24:57.414 --> 24:59.049
- Now he's calling you slow.
- Is he paid to be disrespectful?

25:02.186 --> 25:03.954
Are you two being helped?

25:03.988 --> 25:06.190
Uh, no, no, we're just... we're
just browsing for right now

25:06.223 --> 25:08.359
looking for some cool tees,
maybe some ripped jeans.

25:08.392 --> 25:10.294
Nice, nice.

25:10.327 --> 25:12.029
Need help being styled?

25:12.062 --> 25:14.131
Uh, yeah, yeah, that'd great.

25:14.164 --> 25:15.266
I'm... I'm super new to all this.

25:15.299 --> 25:17.134
Yeah? What did you just start
modeling or something?

25:17.167 --> 25:19.003
- Uh, yeah.
- Oh.

25:19.036 --> 25:20.104
Yeah, but we're, uh, trying to
change this into acting 'cause

25:20.137 --> 25:22.406
our fan base is so up our ass
about it, you know.

25:22.439 --> 25:23.207
Yeah, no, I bet.

25:23.240 --> 25:23.674
Um...

25:24.408 --> 25:25.409
I would be, too.

25:26.176 --> 25:27.911
Who you with?

25:27.945 --> 25:30.547
Uh, well, I basically just got
offered a hand job from a guy

25:30.581 --> 25:33.050
who sells ball trimmers outside.
I wouldn't say I'm "with" him.

25:33.083 --> 25:34.551
Like, I mean, he's cool
or whatever,

25:34.585 --> 25:36.220
but I don't really know him like
that for him to be, you know,

25:36.253 --> 25:36.954
jerking me off.

25:39.290 --> 25:40.291
Yeah, you're funny, man.

25:40.324 --> 25:43.327
What is this guy,
like your agent or something?

25:43.360 --> 25:44.862
Uh, no.

25:44.895 --> 25:47.231
Uh, he actually, no, yeah, yeah,
he's my manger.

25:47.264 --> 25:50.534
Um, we're shopping for an agency
right now.

25:50.567 --> 25:52.436
You know, doing the whole
Hollywood water bottle meet

25:52.469 --> 25:53.137
and greet thing.

25:53.170 --> 25:54.405
Right.

25:54.438 --> 25:55.339
Yeah, you know,
it's such a small community.

25:55.372 --> 25:56.473
Yeah, no, no, I know, I know.

25:56.507 --> 25:58.442
I'm part of the community also.

25:58.475 --> 26:01.445
I mean, look at me, you know.

26:01.478 --> 26:05.616
But, uh, hey, you guys know who
Victoria V is, though, right?

26:05.649 --> 26:09.053
Yeah, but I mean we basically
share a Pilates instructor, man.

26:09.086 --> 26:10.020
Yeah, I love Victoria.

26:10.054 --> 26:11.588
She's a great gal.

26:11.622 --> 26:13.590
Oh, then you probably already
know about her very exclusive

26:13.624 --> 26:16.093
party she's having at her place.

26:16.126 --> 26:20.564
Hot models, and, uh, look I hate
to sound crass, but it's a fact,

26:20.597 --> 26:23.967
a lot of wild, dirty sex
happening.

26:24.001 --> 26:26.870
The password to get in,
Fuckingham Palace.

26:26.904 --> 26:27.971
Sold.

26:28.005 --> 26:29.973
Sweet! You on Insta?

26:30.007 --> 26:31.642
I'll tag you on the invite,
put you on the guest list,

26:31.675 --> 26:34.445
otherwise, like, a thousand
bucks per person to get in.

26:34.478 --> 26:35.646
Yeah, we're... we're actually
about to go see

26:35.679 --> 26:38.215
my girl real quick, but, uh,
if anything, just invite me.

26:38.248 --> 26:39.383
Send me the invite, too.

26:39.416 --> 26:40.617
You know, we'll...
we'll meet up with you,

26:40.651 --> 26:42.353
we'll have some fun.

26:42.386 --> 26:43.520
- You know what I'm saying?
- You can be his plus one, yeah.

26:43.554 --> 26:45.556
Plus...? Yeah, no, that's cool.
Yeah.

26:51.295 --> 26:52.896
Ava, you were amazing.

26:52.930 --> 26:53.630
You killed it.

26:53.664 --> 26:54.098
- Thank you.
- Beautiful.

26:54.131 --> 26:55.199
Yeah, for real.

26:55.232 --> 26:56.433
What she said, man.

26:56.467 --> 26:57.501
I'm gonna need some lessons
from you one day.

26:57.534 --> 26:59.103
Alright babe,
I'll see you...

26:59.136 --> 26:59.771
Fantastic, babe.

26:59.804 --> 27:01.004
- Seriously.
- Thank you!

27:01.038 --> 27:02.473
- Good job.
- Thanks.

27:02.506 --> 27:04.074
- Oh, you did so good!
- Thank you, babe!

27:05.709 --> 27:07.111
Hey, great job.

27:07.144 --> 27:08.979
Some of the most beautiful music
I've ever heard.

27:09.012 --> 27:10.547
Thank you.

27:10.581 --> 27:14.385
Oh, yeah, aren't you
friends with pukey?

27:14.418 --> 27:16.086
Oh, you mean Neil?

27:16.120 --> 27:17.121
I don't know his name.

27:17.154 --> 27:19.490
Yeah, no one, no one knows that
was his name.

27:19.523 --> 27:20.224
Yeah, right?

27:20.257 --> 27:21.291
Guy was a loser.

27:21.325 --> 27:22.593
Good night,
thanks.

27:22.626 --> 27:24.962
What's up?
I'm, uh, I'm Chad.

27:24.995 --> 27:26.597
Uh, hi. Oh!

27:26.630 --> 27:28.632
I'm... Ace.

27:28.665 --> 27:30.067
Like Ace Ventura.

27:30.100 --> 27:32.236
Oh, yeah. I love that band.

27:32.269 --> 27:34.204
Are you guys, uh, are you
friends with this guy?

27:34.238 --> 27:36.707
We're best friend, actually,
so you can ease up.

27:36.740 --> 27:38.208
- Wait, excuse me?
- What?

27:38.242 --> 27:39.443
- What did you say?
- What did you hear?

27:41.145 --> 27:41.612
Alright.

27:46.483 --> 27:47.251
- You ready?
- No.

27:47.284 --> 27:48.218
- You ready?
- No.

27:48.252 --> 27:49.453
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

28:05.269 --> 28:07.171
I'm... A... ss...

28:07.772 --> 28:09.339
Ass?

28:09.373 --> 28:11.008
Did your parents hate you
or something?

28:11.041 --> 28:11.575
No.

28:11.608 --> 28:14.611
Um, sorry, sorry.

28:14.645 --> 28:16.013
I don't know what just happened
to my brain.

28:16.046 --> 28:17.314
- Um.
- Um.

28:17.347 --> 28:19.416
My name's Ace.

28:19.450 --> 28:20.451
Ace.

28:20.484 --> 28:22.319
Like the movie.

28:22.352 --> 28:23.654
Yeah, like the movie.

28:23.687 --> 28:26.023
Well, I'm Summer,
like the season.

28:26.056 --> 28:27.391
Hi.

28:27.424 --> 28:29.059
- Nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you, Summer.

28:29.393 --> 28:32.162
You know, Ava, I always thought
you were cute, by the way.

28:32.196 --> 28:33.630
Really? Why is that?

28:33.664 --> 28:35.265
Well, are you a good kisser,

28:35.299 --> 28:36.366
because that would definitely
make you cute in my book.

28:37.701 --> 28:39.703
Are you guys doing anything
after the show or this...

28:39.736 --> 28:41.104
this weekend, or?

28:41.138 --> 28:43.574
Well, um, it's actually
my birthday.

28:43.607 --> 28:47.077
My parents are out of town,
so I'm throwing myself a party.

28:47.110 --> 28:47.678
- You?
- Happy birthday!

28:47.711 --> 28:48.545
Oh, thanks.

28:48.579 --> 28:51.048
Um, I'm not,
I'm not doing anything.

28:51.081 --> 28:51.682
Really?

28:51.715 --> 28:52.784
Nothing in particular, no.

28:52.817 --> 28:54.651
Hmm.

28:54.685 --> 28:56.220
So I was thinking about my
favourite sexual positions today.

28:56.253 --> 28:57.321
That's too much.

28:58.489 --> 28:59.523
Sounds like time well spent.

28:59.556 --> 29:01.759
Well, you know, it's all
situational for me really.

29:01.793 --> 29:03.527
I mean, do I have all the time
in the world

29:03.560 --> 29:05.295
or am I trying to get it
after a bad date?

29:07.064 --> 29:08.432
Okay.

29:08.465 --> 29:10.434
If it's a bad date,
why are you trying to get it in?

29:10.467 --> 29:12.369
Uh, 'cause my dick never
has a bad date.

29:13.470 --> 29:15.205
Well, it was nice to meet you.

29:15.807 --> 29:20.744
Yeah, um, Summer, um, do you by
any chance have an extra invite

29:20.778 --> 29:22.713
to your party this weekend?

29:22.746 --> 29:24.214
An invite?

29:24.248 --> 29:25.249
Yeah.

29:25.282 --> 29:30.287
Um, you... you seem cool
and it would be great

29:30.320 --> 29:32.456
to stop by, right?

29:32.489 --> 29:35.125
Yeah, maybe. Unfortunately,
we are at max capacity

29:35.158 --> 29:36.193
for the party.

29:36.226 --> 29:38.428
I could put you
on a waiting list.

29:38.462 --> 29:40.631
Yeah, yeah, o... okay.
Um, yeah, it's...

29:40.664 --> 29:41.665
I'm fucking with you.

29:42.432 --> 29:44.268
I'm sorry.

29:44.301 --> 29:45.402
I have one left.

29:49.339 --> 29:51.508
Uh, I hope to see you
at my party, Ass.

29:54.111 --> 29:55.112
I'm a nice ass.

30:08.158 --> 30:09.326
- I got it!
- You got it.

30:09.359 --> 30:10.394
- I got it!
- Who got it?

30:10.427 --> 30:11.461
- I got it!
- And I got it.

30:11.495 --> 30:12.429
- I got it!
- We got it.

30:12.462 --> 30:13.530
- Who got it?
- We got it.

30:13.564 --> 30:14.799
- We got it.
- Uh-huh!

30:14.832 --> 30:16.533
- Oh, I got the invitation.
- Yeah, that's right.

30:16.567 --> 30:17.634
Huh!

30:17.668 --> 30:18.836
- We got the invitation.
- Invitation!

30:18.870 --> 30:19.804
Nice work my dude.

30:19.837 --> 30:21.338
What's your long-term plan?

30:21.371 --> 30:22.472
Well, that's the Uber guy
right that.

30:22.506 --> 30:23.507
Wait, what do you mean
long-term plan?

30:23.540 --> 30:25.342
Yes, I'm not saying I still have
a lot to learn,

30:25.375 --> 30:26.778
but can I let you in
on a little secret?

30:26.811 --> 30:29.580
No, because you're just gonna
tell me anyway.

30:29.613 --> 30:30.447
Go ahead and tell me.

30:31.748 --> 30:33.383
Hey there, handsome.

30:33.417 --> 30:36.320
Look, Neil, girls want to fuck
just as badly as we do.

30:37.487 --> 30:38.856
And you know this how?

30:38.890 --> 30:41.224
It's actually sexist to think
some shit like that.

30:41.258 --> 30:42.292
Alright, sexism is a real issue.

30:42.326 --> 30:44.294
Okay, I consider myself
to be a proud feminist.

30:44.328 --> 30:45.729
Good God!

30:45.763 --> 30:46.864
Alright, do you-are you
circling the block or some shit?

30:46.898 --> 30:48.565
Are you stalking us?

30:48.599 --> 30:50.500
You got a problem with my five
star Uber driving?

30:50.534 --> 30:52.436
No, I have a problem
with your attitude.

30:52.469 --> 30:53.470
Can I have a private
conversation

30:53.503 --> 30:54.271
with my friend, please?

30:54.304 --> 30:55.840
Yes, by all means.

30:55.873 --> 30:57.274
Go ahead.

30:57.307 --> 30:58.208
So I consider myself to be
a proud feminist.

30:58.241 --> 30:59.576
Yeah, I know, me too.

30:59.610 --> 31:00.477
I love my family.

31:00.510 --> 31:01.645
I... I love women.

31:01.678 --> 31:03.146
I love girls, I respect them.

31:03.180 --> 31:04.849
You know I have a healthy
relationship with my mom

31:04.882 --> 31:07.584
and my psycho sister,
and sometimes I wish that

31:07.618 --> 31:10.654
I was a woman, so I could help
fight feminism from the inside.

31:10.687 --> 31:13.190
Okay, did you know that woman
still make seventy-seven cents

31:13.223 --> 31:13.690
to the man's dollar?

31:13.724 --> 31:14.491
Yes.

31:14.524 --> 31:16.193
Think about that shit.

31:16.226 --> 31:17.795
How would you feel being short
changed by twenty-two cents?

31:17.829 --> 31:19.596
Twenty-three, genius.

31:19.630 --> 31:20.464
See, even worse.

31:20.497 --> 31:22.767
Be the new super cool,
non-sexist dude.

31:22.800 --> 31:24.002
Your wish came true, man.

31:24.035 --> 31:26.403
You finally have a second chance
to step up and take a shot.

31:26.436 --> 31:27.604
You got the invite, baby!

31:27.638 --> 31:28.538
Yeah, I got the invite.

31:28.572 --> 31:30.207
I got... This is all I wanted.
I got it.

31:30.240 --> 31:31.508
Oh, my God.

31:31.541 --> 31:32.877
Summer's obviously into you

31:32.910 --> 31:34.344
and you're lacking confidence
right now.

31:34.378 --> 31:35.178
That's fine, that's fine,

31:35.212 --> 31:35.880
'cause it all comes from
practice.

31:35.913 --> 31:37.115
Look it up, Malcolm Gladwell.

31:37.147 --> 31:38.950
You have to bang 10,000 chicks
in order to feel comfortable

31:38.983 --> 31:40.250
having sex with Summer.

31:40.283 --> 31:41.853
Ten...

31:41.886 --> 31:42.686
But we need Viagra, 'cause we're
pressed on time right now.

31:43.821 --> 31:45.355
We need Viagra to bang
10,000 chicks.

31:45.389 --> 31:46.924
- Yes, 10,000 chicks.
- 10,000 chicks.

31:46.958 --> 31:48.826
Do you think LeBron James
or Tom Brady show up

31:48.860 --> 31:50.460
to the championship game
and hope to win?

31:50.494 --> 31:51.461
Or, they fuck people up
all season?

31:51.495 --> 31:53.363
No.

31:53.397 --> 31:54.531
You need to think of Victoria's
party as your season and Summer

31:54.564 --> 31:57.267
as your Super Bowl, and you have
ten hours to fuck up Chad

31:57.300 --> 31:57.935
and win that pussy ring.

31:57.969 --> 31:58.970
Great, got it!

31:59.003 --> 32:00.504
How am I supposed
to fuck up Chad?

32:00.537 --> 32:01.973
I take the school bus.

32:02.006 --> 32:03.206
I've got that covered, man.

32:16.020 --> 32:17.354
Can I help you out
with something?

32:17.387 --> 32:18.288
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

32:21.926 --> 32:23.694
Well, I've got to get to work
soon, so let's hear it.

32:23.727 --> 32:25.763
Oh, wh... what do you do?

32:25.797 --> 32:26.630
I sell Porsches.

32:26.663 --> 32:27.564
You a detective?

32:28.866 --> 32:30.534
Look... look,
I know you're a very busy man.

32:30.567 --> 32:31.903
You know Porsches to sell,
pussies to pop.

32:31.936 --> 32:33.971
I get that, I'm just gonna
cut to the chase.

32:34.005 --> 32:35.840
Alright, my handsome friend
here, he's your new neighbour

32:35.873 --> 32:37.674
and we notice you seem
to have unlimited access

32:37.708 --> 32:38.608
to the sexiest cars.

32:38.642 --> 32:40.410
And we really need
one for one wicked night

32:40.444 --> 32:42.412
of partying we got set up
for tonight.

32:42.446 --> 32:45.917
And you know what they say,
sexy wheels, sexy heels.

32:45.950 --> 32:47.417
"Sexy wheels, sexy heels."

32:47.451 --> 32:49.252
Uh, you funny, man.

32:49.286 --> 32:50.822
So I guess you're the one
with the pretty face that

32:50.855 --> 32:53.256
keeps the girls coming and then,
uh, you keep 'em around

32:53.290 --> 32:54.357
with the funny one liners, huh?

32:54.391 --> 32:55.827
- That's the idea.
- Yeah.

32:55.860 --> 32:56.761
Yeah, yeah, you know, when
you're handsome as hell like us,

32:56.794 --> 32:58.830
you don't need corny jokes.

32:58.863 --> 33:00.497
Alright, Jimbo?

33:00.530 --> 33:01.431
Jimmy.

33:02.733 --> 33:03.801
Time is money and money
is sweet like honey,

33:03.835 --> 33:05.702
so let's talk some rides, guys.

33:05.736 --> 33:08.405
Now, I can take you boys
to the dealership.

33:08.438 --> 33:10.640
We're gonna do everything
on the up where I gotta run

33:10.674 --> 33:12.877
your credit check,
make sure you're over 25,

33:12.910 --> 33:15.345
see what's available on the lot,
yada-yada-yada.

33:15.378 --> 33:18.281
Or, if this little baby's
giving you bedroom eyes,

33:18.315 --> 33:19.750
we can settle everything
right here, right now,

33:19.784 --> 33:20.317
off the books.

33:20.350 --> 33:21.618
No, this car is perfect.

33:21.651 --> 33:24.889
She purrs, and she bites,

33:24.922 --> 33:26.791
but you know what she does best?

33:26.824 --> 33:28.525
She makes them panties drop.

33:28.558 --> 33:29.526
We on the same exact page, man.

33:29.559 --> 33:30.995
I get exactly
what you're saying, my friend.

33:31.028 --> 33:31.829
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

33:31.863 --> 33:33.330
We are reading
the same page here,

33:33.363 --> 33:34.431
like it's our homework
assignment

33:34.464 --> 33:36.901
and it's due tomorrow,
and we're gonna turn it in,

33:36.934 --> 33:38.870
send it off.

33:40.570 --> 33:41.371
Stop.

33:45.575 --> 33:47.477
She's got 430 horsepower,

33:47.511 --> 33:49.781
or as I like to call it,
horsecockpower.

33:49.814 --> 33:51.548
You know what makes the ladies
really excited?

33:51.581 --> 33:52.850
What, respect and equal pay?

33:52.884 --> 33:54.018
Fuck, no!

33:54.051 --> 33:56.620
Press this button right here,
takes you to sports mode.

33:56.653 --> 33:58.756
It's like two beautiful
legs opening right up,

33:58.790 --> 34:01.591
clearing you for expedited
first class entry.

34:01.625 --> 34:02.760
Please remember to fasten
your seat belts

34:02.794 --> 34:04.561
before take off, gentlemen.

34:04.594 --> 34:06.030
- Oh, fuck, yeah!
- No, no, no, no, no.

34:06.063 --> 34:07.430
Can we just slow down
a little bit?

34:07.464 --> 34:08.398
Let's not, uh, uh, uh...

34:08.431 --> 34:09.065
Hey, check the torque on her.

34:17.007 --> 34:19.110
This was fucking crazy.

34:19.143 --> 34:20.677
Yeah. Hangin', bro?

34:20.710 --> 34:22.379
- Yep.
- Where'd your friend go?

34:22.411 --> 34:23.446
Shit!

34:25.514 --> 34:26.650
Ace, you alright, man?

34:26.683 --> 34:27.784
I think so.

34:27.819 --> 34:28.953
Well, then come on, man,

34:28.985 --> 34:30.922
'cause time is money and money
is sweet like honey,

34:30.955 --> 34:32.857
so hop on over here,
'cause it's not funny.

34:32.889 --> 34:33.824
Really sorry about this.

34:34.690 --> 34:37.561
So, how much you got?

34:37.594 --> 34:38.830
How much what?

34:38.862 --> 34:40.530
What? Money?

34:40.563 --> 34:41.665
Yeah, cash.

34:41.697 --> 34:42.967
Yeah, on your person.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.003
$50 only, but I seem to have
misplaced my wallet.

34:46.036 --> 34:47.972
I just can't find it
at the moment.

34:48.005 --> 34:51.775
Oh-oh, you, sir, are no liar.

34:53.043 --> 34:53.878
How did you do that?

34:54.946 --> 34:56.545
So I'm gonna level
with you guys.

34:56.580 --> 34:59.716
Believe it or not,
I wasn't always this cool.

34:59.749 --> 35:01.618
Do you think I would have
as many women as I do

35:01.651 --> 35:03.653
if I didn't have access
to all the Porsches?

35:03.687 --> 35:04.989
Yes.

35:05.022 --> 35:06.523
Exactly right,
because I've worked hard at it.

35:06.556 --> 35:09.026
I've trained,
I've put in the time.

35:09.060 --> 35:11.461
You see, practice not
only makes perfect,

35:11.494 --> 35:12.797
it makes panties drop.

35:12.830 --> 35:14.765
It's like you're in my brain,
man.

35:14.799 --> 35:16.767
Does everything
make panties drop?

35:16.801 --> 35:17.601
How about you, cheekbones?

35:17.634 --> 35:19.402
What you got?

35:19.436 --> 35:21.671
I don't think I... I don't
think I have any ca...

35:21.705 --> 35:23.473
Ah, maybe $20?

35:23.506 --> 35:25.176
Am I standing on a street corner
wearing a tight black dress

35:25.209 --> 35:26.844
and some red bottoms?

35:26.878 --> 35:27.945
N... no.

35:27.979 --> 35:31.715
Then stop trying to fuck me.

35:31.748 --> 35:33.150
Do you guys have, like,
a car you can loan me

35:33.184 --> 35:34.517
as collateral?

35:34.551 --> 35:35.685
Oh, no,
that would be a negative.

35:35.719 --> 35:38.756
Then get the fuck out of here!

35:38.789 --> 35:40.858
If you see me in the street,
don't look at me.

35:40.892 --> 35:43.928
Just look down starting now.

35:43.961 --> 35:45.495
Get out!

35:45.528 --> 35:46.663
Wait.

35:50.667 --> 35:51.903
What's this party about?

35:51.936 --> 35:53.170
Can... can we look up now?

35:53.204 --> 35:54.805
Yeah, yeah, you can look up.

35:54.839 --> 35:56.673
Um, it's this lady Victoria.

35:56.706 --> 35:58.776
Man, I mean, she's having
a party at Fuckingham Palace.

35:58.809 --> 35:59.810
It's supposed to be crazy, man.

35:59.844 --> 36:02.079
A thousand dollars per person.

36:02.113 --> 36:03.180
A thousand dollars ain't cheap.

36:03.214 --> 36:04.048
We're getting in for free.

36:04.081 --> 36:05.515
You know, VIP, you know.

36:05.548 --> 36:06.583
'Cause of me.

36:08.052 --> 36:09.686
Hmm.

36:09.719 --> 36:11.122
Right.

36:11.923 --> 36:13.090
Fuck it.

36:13.124 --> 36:14.926
Alright, my depressingly
poor amigos.

36:15.525 --> 36:16.994
For a mere $70 bucks,

36:17.028 --> 36:19.163
you guys just got
my Seven-Eighteen Boxster GTS

36:19.196 --> 36:19.897
for the night.

36:20.798 --> 36:22.099
- Let's go!
- Sweet!

36:22.133 --> 36:26.070
On one condition, I'm going to
the party with you,

36:26.103 --> 36:28.072
just to, you know, make sure
she's okay and stuff.

36:28.105 --> 36:29.907
Who's she?

36:29.941 --> 36:31.474
The Porsche, moron.

36:32.810 --> 36:34.045
Alright, so here's the plan.

36:34.078 --> 36:35.880
At 7:00 pm tonight,
you're gonna meet me

36:35.913 --> 36:38.049
at Food Mart around
the corner, okay?

36:38.082 --> 36:40.084
You're gonna go inside,
gonna get an extra large

36:40.117 --> 36:42.053
black cherry Slurpee.

36:42.086 --> 36:43.687
I'll be waiting for you
right there with the car.

36:45.222 --> 36:46.857
These Viagras better work, man.

36:46.891 --> 36:49.559
You know old guys
take Viagra to have sex

36:49.592 --> 36:51.728
like guys our age, right?

36:51.762 --> 36:53.697
The only pill I need right now
is Advil because my head

36:53.730 --> 36:55.099
is killing me.

36:55.132 --> 36:56.934
Look, the more you think
about it, the more it hurts.

36:56.968 --> 36:58.069
Alright,
you feel what you attract.

36:58.102 --> 36:59.636
Perception is everything.

36:59.669 --> 37:00.704
I'm not attracting a headache.

37:00.737 --> 37:02.039
I hit the shit out of my head.

37:02.073 --> 37:03.908
- Do you want me to rub it?
- Yeah.

37:03.941 --> 37:05.876
Let's get these dick pills,
alright?

37:05.910 --> 37:07.211
How did you meet this guy again?

37:07.244 --> 37:08.745
On Fortnite.

37:08.779 --> 37:10.214
He's like the Dan Bilzerian
of the school, man.

37:11.949 --> 37:13.150
Enter, it's open.

37:16.787 --> 37:19.156
Is that G-money
I hear behind me?

37:19.190 --> 37:22.193
Is that J-sizzle I see about to
snipe some poor biatches?

37:22.226 --> 37:23.526
Gilbert?

37:23.560 --> 37:24.627
Come here, man.

37:24.661 --> 37:26.163
Let this big bear
get his paws on ya.

37:28.265 --> 37:30.234
You look different
than I imagined.

37:30.267 --> 37:31.302
Uh, yeah.

37:31.335 --> 37:32.770
Nah, man, you too.

37:32.803 --> 37:34.571
You... you look healthy.

37:34.604 --> 37:35.139
Thanks man.

37:35.172 --> 37:36.073
I bought an Apple watch.

37:36.107 --> 37:38.109
Helps me to keep track of
my steps, so.

37:38.142 --> 37:39.810
It's still in the box.

37:39.844 --> 37:40.778
It's pretty cool.

37:40.811 --> 37:43.180
Hey, this is Vanessa,
the love of my life.

37:46.050 --> 37:46.649
Oh, they don't mind.

37:46.683 --> 37:48.285
Who is thi handsome devil?

37:48.319 --> 37:50.154
What, are you friends with an
actual walking sex stick?

37:50.187 --> 37:51.055
Thanks.

37:53.656 --> 37:54.058
It's good to...

37:54.959 --> 37:55.993
Thanks for having us.

37:56.894 --> 37:58.829
You are a gentleman
and a scholar, sir.

37:58.863 --> 37:59.930
You're a prince in an alley,
Gilbert.

37:59.964 --> 38:02.233
Guys, come on in,
have a seat.

38:02.266 --> 38:04.201
So, to what do I owe this
gracious visit

38:04.235 --> 38:05.936
from my favourite Fortnite
compatriot?

38:05.970 --> 38:07.637
Hey, man, like I said,
my Viagra girl,

38:07.670 --> 38:08.873
she went MIA on me, man.

38:08.906 --> 38:09.407
What's her name?

38:09.440 --> 38:10.007
I probably know her.

38:10.041 --> 38:12.243
Uh, it's, uh... Victoria?

38:12.276 --> 38:14.245
- Victoria V.
- Dope shit!

38:14.278 --> 38:15.413
You know she supplies my guy.

38:15.446 --> 38:19.216
She throws like the craziest,
most legendary parties.

38:19.250 --> 38:21.919
Hey, man, let me ask you
something.

38:21.952 --> 38:24.654
What's it like to go through
life knowing everyone

38:24.687 --> 38:25.722
wants to fuck you?

38:27.858 --> 38:30.627
I... I wouldn't say it's, uh,
everyone.

38:30.660 --> 38:32.163
Pretty sure it is everyone.

38:32.196 --> 38:34.098
Not everyone comes up to me
and says they want to fuck me.

38:34.131 --> 38:35.833
I bet if I did a straw poll
in this house,

38:35.866 --> 38:36.934
it would be everyone.

38:38.803 --> 38:39.870
Um...

38:39.904 --> 38:41.338
So I keep the drugs
in the bedroom.

38:41.372 --> 38:44.075
Why don't we continue this
negotiation in there, alright?

38:44.108 --> 38:45.843
Shall we? Let's do it.

38:46.410 --> 38:48.645
Gentlemen, milady.

38:55.718 --> 38:56.921
So, the pills are right there.

38:56.954 --> 38:59.190
You guys could just grab a vile
and you should be all set.

38:59.223 --> 39:00.690
Thank you so much, J.

39:00.723 --> 39:01.892
How much do we owe you for this?

39:01.926 --> 39:02.793
Aw, your money's no good here.

39:02.827 --> 39:04.228
It's on the house.

39:04.261 --> 39:06.097
We were wondering, though,
if maybe we could ask you guys

39:06.130 --> 39:07.664
for a favour in return?

39:07.697 --> 39:08.631
Yo, anything, man.

39:08.665 --> 39:09.632
Just ask.

39:09.666 --> 39:11.268
- Not anything.
- Shut up.

39:11.302 --> 39:13.871
We think you guys
are really cute.

39:13.904 --> 39:15.705
Do you guys think that
we're cute?

39:21.779 --> 39:23.814
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

39:23.848 --> 39:24.614
How... how do you...

39:24.647 --> 39:25.850
If you don't mean it,
it's okay.

39:25.883 --> 39:26.784
You guys are cute as fuck.

39:26.817 --> 39:28.853
- Really?
- Yeah.

39:28.886 --> 39:30.187
- Are you sure?
- No...

39:30.221 --> 39:31.322
You sure you're not just
saying that?

39:31.355 --> 39:33.057
No, no. I-I mean, um,
'cause with...

39:33.723 --> 39:34.959
Ace?

39:34.992 --> 39:36.393
Yeah, yeah.

39:36.427 --> 39:38.062
No, you guys are super cute.

39:38.095 --> 39:41.065
You guys, uh, you've... you've
good chemistry and... and...

39:41.098 --> 39:42.967
and you guys, you know,
you feed off of each other.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.734
You're comfortable
in your own skin together,

39:44.768 --> 39:45.903
so that's...
that's always a plus.

39:45.936 --> 39:47.670
- That's awesome.
- Hmm.

39:47.704 --> 39:49.273
So Vanessa and I
are gonna make love now

39:49.306 --> 39:51.375
and we'd love for you guys
to just be around.

39:51.408 --> 39:54.979
You know, feel free to hop in
or do whatever's comfortable.

39:55.012 --> 39:57.114
You know, have a seat,
take a load off.

39:57.848 --> 40:01.085
Yeah, positive vibes only, okay?

40:02.286 --> 40:02.987
- Um...
- Um...

40:03.020 --> 40:03.787
Great!

40:03.821 --> 40:05.389
Alexa, play my sex jams.

40:05.422 --> 40:07.191
<i>Playing sex jams.</i>

40:16.867 --> 40:18.402
What the fuck
is happening right now?

40:20.304 --> 40:22.206
This is college.

40:29.914 --> 40:31.115
Hey!

40:31.148 --> 40:32.715
Give me your hand.

40:33.417 --> 40:34.351
Come on.

40:34.385 --> 40:36.187
Press your palm against my palm.

40:36.220 --> 40:37.221
Timothée Chalamet.

40:37.254 --> 40:38.389
Come on.

40:41.058 --> 40:42.026
You've been summoned.

40:55.906 --> 40:57.241
Yes, that's great.

40:58.542 --> 40:59.944
Family style, over here.

40:59.977 --> 41:01.312
Let's cross fingers.

41:01.345 --> 41:03.080
Let's cross fingers,
family style.

41:04.348 --> 41:06.817
Bro, you've been summoned,
join us.

41:09.820 --> 41:10.788
Come on.

41:27.238 --> 41:28.239
Mm.

41:37.881 --> 41:39.883
That should do it.

41:39.917 --> 41:42.186
Thanks so much, boys
for stopping by.

41:42.219 --> 41:44.088
That's what we call
a win-win, you know.

41:47.891 --> 41:49.293
We take this to our graves.

41:50.160 --> 41:51.195
Take what?

41:51.996 --> 41:53.030
Exactly.

41:56.267 --> 41:57.401
I just don't
know about this guy.

41:57.434 --> 41:58.569
What if he doesn't show?

41:58.602 --> 42:00.537
Neil, he's your neighbour,
alright?

42:00.571 --> 42:01.372
He's, at the very least,

42:01.405 --> 42:03.274
a very financially stable
homeowner,

42:03.307 --> 42:04.875
not just some random dude
we met playing video games

42:04.908 --> 42:06.043
with alright?

42:06.076 --> 42:08.879
Plus he's normal,
he's cool, he's handsome,

42:08.912 --> 42:11.048
and you shouldn't be questioning
shit with a $20 investment.

42:15.419 --> 42:18.489
The cashier seems to have taken
a real liking to us.

42:18.522 --> 42:19.857
He's probably wondering
what a healthy stud like you

42:19.890 --> 42:21.292
is even doing here.

42:21.325 --> 42:22.393
None of this shit is organic.

42:26.297 --> 42:27.097
Nice.

42:27.131 --> 42:27.931
Come on, let's go.

42:31.335 --> 42:32.202
How you doing?

42:32.236 --> 42:33.370
Get this real quick?

42:36.974 --> 42:38.609
Time to separate
the men from the boys.

42:48.152 --> 42:49.320
Okay.

42:52.356 --> 42:54.425
Alright,
it's go time, boys.

42:54.458 --> 42:56.860
Let's do this.

42:56.894 --> 42:58.962
Give me all the money out
of your register now.

42:58.996 --> 43:01.532
Give me all the money
out of the register!

43:01.565 --> 43:04.001
- Now, motherfucker!
- Fuck!

43:04.034 --> 43:05.235
You made me sound like
Samuel Jackson.

43:05.269 --> 43:06.103
- Jimmy? Jimmy?
- What, chubby?

43:06.136 --> 43:07.571
What am I supposed to do
with the bags?

43:07.604 --> 43:09.306
Just hold on to it for a second,
goddamn, man.

43:09.340 --> 43:10.441
Your move, Apu.

43:10.474 --> 43:11.375
That's... that's racist.

43:11.408 --> 43:13.344
That ain't racist,
that's his name, man.

43:13.377 --> 43:14.978
His mama named him that.

43:15.012 --> 43:16.113
Look at all this.

43:16.146 --> 43:17.114
Rob the motherfucker.

43:17.147 --> 43:19.249
You know them gas prices
is high as hell, man.

43:19.283 --> 43:19.983
Alright, start the car.

43:20.017 --> 43:21.118
Let's go!

43:21.151 --> 43:22.486
The Skittles, nigg...

43:22.519 --> 43:23.354
Man, come here.

43:23.387 --> 43:25.022
- Why is this bag so big?
- Shut up, man!

43:25.055 --> 43:26.357
'Sup with all
these questions?

43:26.390 --> 43:27.191
Alright, go.

43:27.224 --> 43:28.892
Get outta here.

43:28.926 --> 43:29.626
Wait, wait, wait,
there's more money.

43:29.660 --> 43:30.160
There's more money.

43:30.194 --> 43:30.961
There's more money.

43:30.994 --> 43:32.129
Come help,
we're a bout to be rich.

43:32.162 --> 43:32.563
Oh, shit!

43:36.633 --> 43:37.301
What the fuck?

43:37.334 --> 43:38.369
Who pokes eyes?

43:38.402 --> 43:40.137
Go, go, go, go,
go, go!

43:40.170 --> 43:41.472
What the fuck!?

43:41.505 --> 43:42.306
I don't want my fingerprints
on this shit either.

43:42.339 --> 43:43.240
Press the gas!

43:43.273 --> 43:44.108
Fine!

43:47.945 --> 43:49.113
What the hell
is wrong with you, man?

43:49.146 --> 43:50.414
You never drive before?

43:50.447 --> 43:51.482
I just got my permit, man!

43:59.456 --> 44:00.257
Oh, fuck!

44:00.290 --> 44:01.692
Oh...

44:01.725 --> 44:02.593
Wait!

44:02.626 --> 44:03.494
Gilbert!

44:03.527 --> 44:04.495
Wait, Gilbert!

44:04.528 --> 44:05.262
What the fuck you doing?

44:05.295 --> 44:07.398
- I can't leave Neil, man.
- Why?

44:07.431 --> 44:08.565
He's my best
friend and I love him.

44:08.599 --> 44:09.400
Oh, my...

44:09.433 --> 44:11.535
- I love him, man.
- Stop saying that.

44:11.568 --> 44:12.936
We're not stopping.

44:12.970 --> 44:15.372
Wait, guys...
No, no, no, no, no, no!

44:15.406 --> 44:16.540
Pop the trunk!

44:16.573 --> 44:17.141
Pop the trunk.

44:17.174 --> 44:18.308
Well, how do I do that?

44:18.342 --> 44:19.209
Pop the trunk!

44:19.243 --> 44:20.144
Wait!

44:20.177 --> 44:21.044
Wait!

44:24.014 --> 44:25.082
I'll kill you, motherfuckers!

44:29.319 --> 44:30.020
Whoo!

44:30.053 --> 44:31.021
What a rush!

44:34.425 --> 44:36.293
Looks like we have another
one gone wild.

44:36.326 --> 44:37.661
Go figure.

44:37.694 --> 44:38.996
It must be all the fresh pizza
and chicken wings.

44:41.465 --> 44:43.367
Drop your weapon and get down on
the ground, sir!

44:43.734 --> 44:45.502
- Do it now!
- No, no, no, no.

44:45.536 --> 44:46.370
They robbed me.

44:46.403 --> 44:47.538
You should be chasing
that Porsche.

44:47.571 --> 44:49.640
Yeah, I'm sure guys in Porsches
rob shitty Food Marts

44:49.673 --> 44:50.274
all the time.

44:50.307 --> 44:51.508
It makes perfect sense.

44:51.542 --> 44:53.444
Get down on the ground,
shitbag!

44:53.477 --> 44:55.212
Do it, now!

44:56.046 --> 44:58.382
I'm still failing to understand
what the problem is here.

44:59.183 --> 45:01.385
Okay, for starters, how about
the fact that you didn't tell us

45:01.418 --> 45:03.153
we were going to be robbing
a fucking Food Mart.

45:03.187 --> 45:04.488
Okay, first of all,

45:04.521 --> 45:07.024
Food Marts get robbed
all the damn time, alright?

45:07.057 --> 45:08.625
That's the price of selling
cheap shit,

45:08.659 --> 45:09.626
and being on every block.

45:09.660 --> 45:11.395
Secondly, I didn't plan this.

45:11.428 --> 45:14.031
It's just, like, you know,
it's a spontaneous thing.

45:14.064 --> 45:15.098
I'm a spontaneous dude.

45:15.132 --> 45:15.966
I knew y'all was broke,

45:15.999 --> 45:17.568
so I went in
and got y'all some money.

45:17.601 --> 45:18.535
What's wrong with that?

45:18.569 --> 45:20.370
So you just happened to carry
a mask and...

45:20.404 --> 45:21.605
and a gun on you?

45:21.638 --> 45:23.073
See this gun, fake!

45:23.106 --> 45:23.740
Man, what are you doing?

45:23.775 --> 45:25.309
Okay.

45:25.342 --> 45:27.444
And I wear the mask sometimes
'cause, you know,

45:27.478 --> 45:28.312
chicks like it.

45:28.345 --> 45:29.446
I'm a freak.

45:32.349 --> 45:34.418
You realize the cops are gonna
be looking for us, right?

45:34.451 --> 45:35.552
'Cause our faces
are on that camera,

45:35.586 --> 45:37.454
not Mister Ski Mask over here.

45:37.488 --> 45:39.590
Okay, you shouldn't be concerned
with any of that shit.

45:39.623 --> 45:40.758
I should be.

45:40.792 --> 45:41.759
Alright, you're good.

45:43.527 --> 45:45.162
You're fine with this?

45:45.195 --> 45:46.330
You're fine with the scenario
the way that all this shit

45:46.363 --> 45:47.431
went down?

45:47.464 --> 45:49.633
Neil, I wasn't gonna
leave you, man.

45:49.666 --> 45:51.769
I came back for you,
ma... Jimmy, tell him.

45:51.803 --> 45:53.237
Yeah, I wanted to leave you.

45:53.270 --> 45:54.671
I thought you was dead weight.

45:54.705 --> 45:56.240
But he love you,
so I was like, alright.

45:56.273 --> 45:57.708
- I love you, man.
- Don't do that.

45:57.741 --> 45:59.176
- I love you, man.
- You don't love me.

45:59.209 --> 46:00.310
- Yes, I do.
- You don't love me.

46:00.344 --> 46:01.578
- Don't...
- Neil, I fuckin' love you, man!

46:01.612 --> 46:03.213
Don't abuse that word, man.

46:03.247 --> 46:04.314
Look, is this "The Notebook"?

46:04.348 --> 46:06.116
Well, y... you wanted
the Porsche.

46:06.149 --> 46:07.618
You wanted the Porsche,
so we got you the Porsche.

46:07.651 --> 46:09.353
- I don't care about...
- You wanted to be like Chad.

46:09.386 --> 46:10.587
- So I got you a Porsche.
- Porsche, baby.

46:10.621 --> 46:11.421
It's a clean ass Porsche.

46:11.455 --> 46:12.757
No, I don't care about
the Porsche.

46:12.790 --> 46:13.457
Who doesn't want a Porsche?

46:13.490 --> 46:14.191
I never cared about the Porsche.

46:14.224 --> 46:15.092
No one cares about the Porsche.

46:15.125 --> 46:16.794
You saying you don't want
this Porsche?

46:16.828 --> 46:18.562
I want a Porsche.

46:18.595 --> 46:21.265
In order to have intercourse,
you've got to have a Porsche.

46:21.298 --> 46:22.599
I didn't want the dick pills.

46:22.633 --> 46:24.167
And I definitely
don't want to go to jail

46:24.201 --> 46:25.536
for robbing fucking Food Marts.

46:26.670 --> 46:29.506
All I wanted was a pineapple
invitation

46:29.540 --> 46:30.707
and to go to Summer's party.

46:30.741 --> 46:32.209
Alright, we all got that.

46:32.242 --> 46:34.244
So me, you and Jimmy,
we can all roll right now

46:34.278 --> 46:35.746
in the Porsche.

46:35.780 --> 46:40.317
I... I even held your weird
friend's hand while he orgasmed.

46:40.350 --> 46:41.385
Hold his hand
when he was whatin'?

46:41.418 --> 46:43.654
Hey, man, will you...

46:43.687 --> 46:45.255
I was in there with you.

46:45.289 --> 46:46.657
Neil, you don't got to say
that shit around him.

46:47.892 --> 46:50.694
I never would have puked on
Summer if it weren't for you.

46:50.727 --> 46:52.296
I was just trying to help you.

46:54.832 --> 46:57.134
Alright, this happens
at my dealership all the time.

46:57.167 --> 46:59.736
It's called a breakdown of
communication.

46:59.771 --> 47:02.673
That's what's happening right
now with you guys, okay?

47:02.706 --> 47:05.810
A great way to solve it is just
by being nice to each other.

47:05.843 --> 47:07.277
Make up, okay?

47:07.946 --> 47:09.379
I'm... I'm good.
I'm done.

47:15.485 --> 47:16.653
Do you want me to shoot him?

47:21.893 --> 47:23.761
Looks like you're my VIP
customer of the night.

47:25.897 --> 47:27.497
Where's your
friend, the crazy one?

47:31.769 --> 47:33.136
Fuck him.

47:36.506 --> 47:39.242
Y'all pretty tight, huh?

47:39.276 --> 47:41.913
Yeah, that's my best friend.

47:41.946 --> 47:44.849
Or was... I guess.

47:44.882 --> 47:47.651
Man, real best friends fight and
make up all the time, man.

47:47.684 --> 47:50.554
Y'all'll be back, trust that.

47:51.555 --> 47:52.389
Yeah.

47:54.324 --> 47:55.726
Want to loosen up a little bit
before we, uh,

47:55.760 --> 47:57.160
hit this party, though?

48:10.240 --> 48:11.642
Born ready, man.

48:20.250 --> 48:21.551
Hey, how's the party?
What's going on?

48:21.585 --> 48:22.352
Mm.

48:22.386 --> 48:24.221
Hey, you wanna dance?

48:24.254 --> 48:27.391
It's alright,
not too crowded yet.

48:27.424 --> 48:28.392
Is Chad there?

48:28.960 --> 48:31.728
Oh, I said no gifts!

48:31.763 --> 48:32.964
Yes.

48:32.997 --> 48:35.198
And I would advise
bringing her a gift.

48:35.232 --> 48:37.534
<i>Chad is bringing his A game.</i>

48:37.567 --> 48:39.403
Of course he is.

48:39.436 --> 48:40.203
What do I get her?

48:40.237 --> 48:41.873
<i>Something simple, cute.</i>

48:41.906 --> 48:43.306
<i>Bring her a pocket dildo.</i>

48:43.340 --> 48:45.509
N... I'm not gonna get
her a dildo, Jaclyn.

48:45.542 --> 48:46.376
Okay, bye.

48:46.410 --> 48:47.511
I gotta go.

48:54.518 --> 48:55.585
Hey, I'm gonna grab something
from the store.

48:55.619 --> 48:56.821
I'll be right back.

48:56.854 --> 48:58.823
Cool, I'll be out here having
fun pumping gas.

49:00.490 --> 49:01.959
- Hey.
- Hey.

49:16.974 --> 49:19.242
Can I get thirty on seven
and a pack of menthols, please?

49:20.343 --> 49:21.045
How you doing?

49:21.079 --> 49:22.814
Good, you?

49:22.847 --> 49:24.548
Shitty,
we had a Food Mart hit down the street.

49:24.581 --> 49:25.917
You guys got any suspects?

49:25.950 --> 49:27.051
We've got video footage.

49:27.085 --> 49:30.287
Some handsome motherfucker,
his fat friend, and here.

49:31.321 --> 49:32.689
Guy, that's my dog.

49:32.723 --> 49:33.557
We've got video footage.
That's Tommy Lee Jones, yeah.

49:33.590 --> 49:34.759
He's cute. A little excited,
ain't he?

49:34.792 --> 49:36.326
Yeah,
that's him and I in Ramerwood.

49:36.359 --> 49:37.161
It's a Chinese restaurant.

49:37.195 --> 49:38.996
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry.

49:39.030 --> 49:40.330
I'm not gonna hurt you.

49:40.363 --> 49:41.298
Oh, my God, no, no, no!

49:41.331 --> 49:42.299
Don't do it, don't do it!

49:42.332 --> 49:43.567
What? Why?

49:43.600 --> 49:44.902
I'm already committed here
if you can't tell.

49:44.936 --> 49:46.369
No, I'm...
I'm trying to help you.

49:46.403 --> 49:47.237
It's my first time.

49:47.270 --> 49:48.371
They say the first time's
the hardest.

49:48.405 --> 49:49.807
No, no, no, wait.

49:49.841 --> 49:50.775
There's a cop at the register.
Seriously, don't do it.

49:50.808 --> 49:52.043
Stop fuckin' with me, man.

49:52.076 --> 49:53.343
Do you think this is easy?

49:53.376 --> 49:54.578
You should try it, dip shit.

49:54.611 --> 49:56.013
I'm... I'm not...
I've...

49:58.415 --> 50:00.350
That's the video.

50:00.383 --> 50:02.586
These motherfuckers robbed
a Food Mart in a Porsche.

50:02.619 --> 50:04.287
Who robs a Food Mart
in a Porsche?

50:04.321 --> 50:05.288
Nobody does.

50:05.322 --> 50:06.523
It smells fishy.

50:06.556 --> 50:07.524
We think it's an inside job.

50:07.557 --> 50:09.626
Let me get two ring pops
for my buddy the Ramrod.

50:34.518 --> 50:35.385
- What the...
- Don't make me do it!

50:35.418 --> 50:37.021
Okay, drop the gun now!

50:37.054 --> 50:38.022
No.

50:38.055 --> 50:39.791
Drop the gun.

50:39.824 --> 50:40.624
I'm gonna shoot him.

50:40.657 --> 50:41.926
No, you're not.

50:41.959 --> 50:43.761
Yeah, I am and... and then,
and then who knows.

50:43.795 --> 50:45.062
That shit ain't gonna work
like you think.

50:45.096 --> 50:48.032
Drop... the gun!

50:48.065 --> 50:49.466
You drop your gun!

50:50.067 --> 50:51.002
No!

50:57.141 --> 50:58.608
I'm gonna shoot him, man.

50:58.642 --> 51:00.410
You don't know me.

51:00.443 --> 51:01.645
You don't know
my capabilities.

51:01.678 --> 51:03.647
Wait a minute,
you shut up for a second.

51:03.680 --> 51:04.748
Are you recording this?

51:04.782 --> 51:06.349
Yeah, man.

51:06.383 --> 51:07.852
You guys don't have the best
reputation right now.

51:07.885 --> 51:09.486
That's right,
Black Lives Matter.

51:11.122 --> 51:11.789
Okay.

51:11.823 --> 51:13.124
Neither of you two are Black.

51:13.157 --> 51:14.457
That's why you haven't
shot him yet?

51:17.094 --> 51:18.595
I know yo...

51:18.628 --> 51:20.765
You're the handsome
motherfucker from Food Mart.

51:21.999 --> 51:24.568
Dude, dude, we've gotta go!

51:24.601 --> 51:25.702
We gotta go!

51:28.405 --> 51:29.372
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

51:36.479 --> 51:37.882
Whose list are you on?

51:37.915 --> 51:39.784
Uh, that will be Ken,
and my name is Ace.

51:39.817 --> 51:41.052
Ace, huh?

51:42.019 --> 51:44.021
Yeah, like...
like Ventura.

51:44.055 --> 51:45.756
Alrighty, then!

51:46.556 --> 51:47.158
Welcome, Ace.

51:47.825 --> 51:48.592
Nice car.

51:48.625 --> 51:49.994
It's my weekend whip.

51:50.027 --> 51:50.828
They're good.

51:50.862 --> 51:52.662
And here are your mandatory
outfits.

51:55.800 --> 51:56.868
Outfits?

52:00.972 --> 52:01.973
Okay.

52:05.843 --> 52:07.577
Have a good time, gentlemen.

52:17.021 --> 52:18.588
Sushi to go.

52:18.622 --> 52:19.991
Sushi to go.

52:26.596 --> 52:27.999
Man.

52:28.032 --> 52:28.866
Okay.

52:31.668 --> 52:32.904
Yo, man, this is the shit, man.

52:32.937 --> 52:34.205
What did I tell you?

52:34.238 --> 52:35.139
What did I tell you?

52:35.172 --> 52:36.040
You told me.

52:36.073 --> 52:37.141
You, uh, told me.

52:37.174 --> 52:38.276
This is it.

52:38.309 --> 52:41.078
Uh, does this seem like a bit of
a guy thing to you?

52:41.112 --> 52:43.613
Oh, a guy thing to me is
watching football with a beer

52:43.647 --> 52:44.882
in one hand and my nuts
in the other,

52:44.916 --> 52:46.716
but I ain't trippin'.

52:46.750 --> 52:49.552
This is my first
man on man extravaganza.

52:49.586 --> 52:50.755
You got any friends here?

52:50.788 --> 52:51.789
I don't think so.

52:52.522 --> 52:53.590
Gilbert?

52:54.959 --> 52:56.559
Gilbert!

52:56.593 --> 52:57.527
Shit!

52:58.930 --> 53:00.630
- G Spot!
- Hey.

53:00.664 --> 53:02.867
How did I know I'd find you
here, you sexy bitch?

53:02.900 --> 53:04.168
Yeah, we had fun today, right?

53:05.669 --> 53:06.871
1Up to you, Justin.

53:06.904 --> 53:08.205
Whoo!

53:08.239 --> 53:08.940
Hey, man, you've got a little
thing on your...

53:08.973 --> 53:09.572
Whoa!

53:09.606 --> 53:10.540
Oh!

53:11.842 --> 53:12.910
- What the fuck was that, man?
- Relax, dude.

53:12.944 --> 53:14.577
It's just cocaine,
full nose candy.

53:14.611 --> 53:15.212
Dude, relax.

53:15.246 --> 53:16.013
Stop being so square.

53:16.047 --> 53:16.781
Come on.

53:20.650 --> 53:22.019
Hey, uh, enjoy yourself,
G Spot.

53:22.053 --> 53:22.887
Wait, wait, wait!

53:22.920 --> 53:23.788
Jimmy, where...
where you goin', man?

53:23.821 --> 53:24.388
- Come on, dude.
- Where you going, Jimmy?

53:24.422 --> 53:25.089
We got to dance, bitch!

53:25.122 --> 53:27.158
Guys,
come meet my friend.

53:41.705 --> 53:42.974
Oh!

53:43.007 --> 53:44.641
I'm so glad you made it.

53:44.674 --> 53:46.811
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

53:46.844 --> 53:49.512
My pussy and I
have been waiting for you.

53:49.546 --> 53:52.116
Well, the wait is over
for both of you.

53:57.922 --> 53:59.090
Hey, buddy.

53:59.123 --> 54:00.523
Yeah?

54:00.557 --> 54:01.759
Do you want to hang out
sometime?

54:01.792 --> 54:03.027
- Uh...
- Here's my card.

54:03.060 --> 54:05.062
It has all my contact info
on there.

54:05.096 --> 54:06.730
Oh, and I talked
to my girlfriend.

54:06.764 --> 54:09.233
She's down to clown around
in threesome town.

54:09.266 --> 54:11.235
She said you could be
the mayor.

54:11.268 --> 54:13.137
- Okay.
- Cool.

54:26.583 --> 54:27.852
Jaclyn, hey.

54:27.885 --> 54:29.186
Jaclyn?

54:29.220 --> 54:30.021
Hmm?

54:30.821 --> 54:32.589
- Where is she?
- No.

54:32.622 --> 54:33.290
No, no.

54:33.791 --> 54:34.925
I need your help.

54:34.959 --> 54:37.061
- Jesus Christ.
- Who are you?

54:37.094 --> 54:38.728
Oh, Jesus Christ!

54:38.763 --> 54:39.263
Oh, my God.

54:39.296 --> 54:40.231
I completely forgot.

54:40.264 --> 54:41.098
He's...

54:41.132 --> 54:41.731
- Hmm?
- Oh.

54:41.766 --> 54:42.800
You could go kiss her now.

54:54.644 --> 54:55.279
Whoa!

54:55.312 --> 54:55.846
Sorry, dude.

54:55.880 --> 54:57.081
Watch your step, man.

54:57.114 --> 54:58.082
My bad.

55:17.068 --> 55:17.935
Oh!

55:17.968 --> 55:19.170
Hey, what's up, Black dude.

55:19.203 --> 55:20.237
How you doing, man?

55:20.271 --> 55:22.039
I'm looking
for the fuckin' room.

55:22.073 --> 55:23.640
Any ideas, Lennox Lewis?

55:25.943 --> 55:26.743
What you got there?

55:39.423 --> 55:41.658
Show 'em what you got.

55:41.691 --> 55:43.828
What is that double dickin' it,
or jizz in the eye?

55:43.861 --> 55:46.663
Alright, you... can you just
support me right now?

55:46.696 --> 55:47.531
What the fuck? I am.

55:47.565 --> 55:48.933
You're not being
a good wingwoman at all.

55:48.966 --> 55:50.101
Yes, I am being a good...

55:50.134 --> 55:50.968
That's so mean.

55:51.001 --> 55:51.402
I led you...

55:51.435 --> 55:52.403
Whoo!

55:52.436 --> 55:53.938
Just go dance with her.

55:53.971 --> 55:55.372
She's right fucking there,
and she's asking for it.

55:55.406 --> 55:56.173
She wants it.

55:56.207 --> 55:57.640
It's not... No.

55:57.674 --> 55:58.242
Go!

55:58.275 --> 55:59.844
It's not the right time.

55:59.877 --> 56:02.079
It is the right time.

56:02.113 --> 56:03.746
Let me tell you a secret.

56:03.781 --> 56:04.849
It is the right time.

56:06.383 --> 56:07.785
What are you doing?

56:07.818 --> 56:09.086
I'm cueing you.

56:10.387 --> 56:11.088
Hi!

56:11.122 --> 56:13.090
I bumped right...
That's so crazy!

56:14.291 --> 56:15.226
I didn't even mean to do that
at all.

56:15.259 --> 56:16.227
- Hi.
- Hi.

56:16.260 --> 56:18.162
You look so sexy.

56:18.195 --> 56:18.829
Wow.

56:18.863 --> 56:19.662
- Oh, my God.
- Thank you.

56:19.696 --> 56:21.432
We should make this
thing happen.

56:21.465 --> 56:22.967
- Oh, really?
- Oh, we're leaving.

56:23.000 --> 56:24.335
- Alright, I love you.
- We'll see you in a while.

56:24.368 --> 56:25.735
- Bye.
- Love you!

56:31.876 --> 56:33.010
Hey, Summer.

56:33.043 --> 56:34.445
- Hey!
- Hi.

56:34.478 --> 56:35.146
Made it!

56:36.881 --> 56:38.748
Ass?

56:38.782 --> 56:40.284
Um... Ac... actually...

56:40.317 --> 56:41.385
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

56:41.418 --> 56:42.253
I know it's Ace.

56:42.286 --> 56:43.420
Oh, yeah.

56:43.454 --> 56:44.054
Good one.

56:44.088 --> 56:45.756
Ass.

56:45.789 --> 56:47.158
Yeah, well, actually I have a...
I have the invitation.

56:47.191 --> 56:48.425
I brought it.

56:48.459 --> 56:50.060
And you still have it?

56:50.094 --> 56:51.462
Yeah.

56:51.495 --> 56:53.730
Security didn't take it
at the door?

56:53.764 --> 56:56.333
Oh, uh, I didn't... I didn't see
security there.

56:56.367 --> 56:58.735
- What-
- I'm fucking with you.

56:58.769 --> 57:00.237
There's no security,
It's not the airport.

57:00.271 --> 57:00.971
Oh!

57:02.373 --> 57:03.274
You know I think that you're
the only person that

57:03.307 --> 57:05.176
has that still.

57:05.209 --> 57:08.245
Oh, uh, it just...
it was nice.

57:08.279 --> 57:10.014
Oh, my God, um...

57:10.047 --> 57:11.182
What time is it?

57:11.215 --> 57:13.851
Um, almost nine.

57:14.485 --> 57:15.486
I have to go check the food.

57:15.519 --> 57:17.054
- I'm so sorry.
- Um...

57:17.087 --> 57:17.922
Okay.

57:17.955 --> 57:18.822
Stay.

57:18.856 --> 57:19.456
Dance.

57:19.490 --> 57:20.291
- Have fun!
- Yeah.

57:20.324 --> 57:22.692
No, I'll keep...
I'll keep dancing.

57:24.128 --> 57:25.462
Double dickin' it.

57:30.367 --> 57:31.302
You know these clowns?

57:31.335 --> 57:32.203
I know him.

57:32.236 --> 57:33.103
I know him as Gilbert.

57:33.137 --> 57:34.737
We play Fortnite together.

57:34.772 --> 57:35.940
He's a sweet guy.

57:35.973 --> 57:37.074
He said that you supply him
all the time.

57:37.107 --> 57:38.909
Oh, that adds up.

57:38.943 --> 57:40.177
Take the ball gags
out of their fucking mouths.

57:42.346 --> 57:43.914
Thank you.

57:43.948 --> 57:45.416
I... I think this is just
all a huge misunderstanding.

57:45.449 --> 57:47.084
Misunderstanding?

57:47.117 --> 57:50.221
A misunderstand, no, no,
this is not a misunderstanding.

57:50.254 --> 57:54.425
This is a fuck up,
that which cannot be un-fucked.

57:54.458 --> 57:56.327
I throw these parties
because they cater

57:56.360 --> 57:58.395
to a very specific
clientele base.

57:58.429 --> 57:59.930
- The gays?
- Yeah.

57:59.964 --> 58:01.899
Gay guys have so much money
because all they do

58:01.932 --> 58:05.369
is look amazing, take vacations,
fuck, and do drugs.

58:05.402 --> 58:07.238
And I throw these parties
knowing I will get back three

58:07.271 --> 58:10.808
or four times the amount
I put in as an investment.

58:10.841 --> 58:11.875
It's called an ROI.

58:11.909 --> 58:14.078
And you two fucking clowns
thought it would be okay

58:14.111 --> 58:16.547
to come in my house and steal
my motherfucking money.

58:16.580 --> 58:17.915
Look, I... I completely
understand

58:17.948 --> 58:19.116
where you're coming from,
Lady Victoria.

58:19.149 --> 58:21.552
You seem to have a very strong
sense of entrepreneurship,

58:21.585 --> 58:23.420
but... but I actually graduate
high school pretty soon,

58:23.454 --> 58:24.955
so maybe I can work
off that debt.

58:24.989 --> 58:26.090
Shut the fuck up.

58:26.123 --> 58:27.124
- Justin!
- Yeah?

58:27.157 --> 58:28.292
Did he just say highschool?

58:28.325 --> 58:31.562
Uh... I wasn't listening,

58:31.595 --> 58:33.297
but I'm sending you
my deepest apologies.

58:33.330 --> 58:35.432
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

58:35.466 --> 58:37.835
Jimmy, I'm keeping
your fuckin' Porsche.

58:37.868 --> 58:39.103
You can say
goodbye to that pussy magnet.

58:39.136 --> 58:41.238
With all due respect,
Miss White Lady,

58:41.272 --> 58:42.106
you can't have my Porsche.

58:42.139 --> 58:43.007
It's a dealership vehicle.

58:43.040 --> 58:44.141
Oh, 'cause it's a dealership
vehicle?

58:44.174 --> 58:45.075
Yeah, they'll come after you.

58:45.109 --> 58:46.010
I'll go to fucking Porsche jail?

58:46.043 --> 58:47.444
Give her the Porsche.

58:47.478 --> 58:48.479
- I'm not giving her my Porsche.
- Give her the Porsche.

58:48.512 --> 58:49.847
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

58:49.880 --> 58:50.781
Give her the Porsche.

58:50.814 --> 58:51.382
I ain't giving her no damn
Porsche, man.

58:51.415 --> 58:53.150
Then we'll fuckin' die.

58:53.183 --> 58:54.585
If either of you two ever come
near me again or ruin

58:54.618 --> 58:57.021
one of my parties,
I will personally

58:57.054 --> 58:58.589
be responsible
for burning both

58:58.622 --> 59:01.458
of your useless fucking
dicks off.

59:01.492 --> 59:03.427
That makes it... that makes it
sound like one of you

59:03.460 --> 59:04.561
might have two dicks.

59:04.595 --> 59:06.497
Okay, to clarify,
you both have one dick

59:06.530 --> 59:08.565
and I'm burning that dick off.

59:09.500 --> 59:10.401
The keys are in his pocket.

59:17.241 --> 59:18.142
Okay.

59:18.175 --> 59:18.575
Hey!

59:18.609 --> 59:19.576
Hey, Chad.

59:19.610 --> 59:20.978
How you doing, man?

59:21.011 --> 59:22.146
Wh... are you having a good time,
Ace, right?

59:22.179 --> 59:23.947
Uh, yeah.

59:23.981 --> 59:25.149
Yeah, thanks, man.

59:25.182 --> 59:26.283
Just got here, so.

59:26.317 --> 59:27.885
Listen, um,

59:30.587 --> 59:33.457
You like Summer, right?

59:33.490 --> 59:35.359
Uh, she's... she's cool.

59:35.392 --> 59:37.294
Man, she's beyond cool.

59:37.328 --> 59:37.861
Am I right, Matt?

59:37.895 --> 59:39.630
Like, bro, of course.

59:39.663 --> 59:42.199
We know she your baddy, brah.

59:42.232 --> 59:43.901
- I don't...
- Listen, listen.

59:43.934 --> 59:45.903
You know, we're...
we're both handsome guys.

59:45.936 --> 59:47.905
We skip dessert every now
and then.

59:47.938 --> 59:49.173
No hard feelings.

59:52.609 --> 59:54.244
May the best man win.

59:55.379 --> 59:56.213
What?

59:57.147 --> 59:58.048
Get outta here, man!

59:58.082 --> 59:58.916
You too!

59:58.949 --> 01:00:00.351
Oh, man!

01:00:02.619 --> 01:00:04.555
I cannot go back to work without
that Porsche, man.

01:00:04.588 --> 01:00:06.490
Why can't you just tell them it
was stolen?

01:00:06.523 --> 01:00:09.159
Because I've used that excuse
like a thousand times.

01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:14.531
Bingo, bitch!

01:00:14.833 --> 01:00:17.134
How're we gonna get it
outta there?

01:00:17.167 --> 01:00:18.102
Um...

01:00:27.444 --> 01:00:28.512
What are you doing, man?

01:00:30.047 --> 01:00:30.914
What are you looking for?

01:00:30.948 --> 01:00:31.682
Uh...

01:00:32.383 --> 01:00:33.283
This.

01:00:34.284 --> 01:00:35.119
Are you sure about this?

01:00:36.587 --> 01:00:38.222
You're welcome to call an Uber.

01:00:38.255 --> 01:00:39.556
I don't have
any fucking pants on.

01:00:39.590 --> 01:00:41.091
My phone was in my pants.

01:00:41.125 --> 01:00:41.692
Exactly.

01:00:41.725 --> 01:00:42.626
Get in.

01:00:44.561 --> 01:00:45.195
Fuck!

01:00:46.563 --> 01:00:48.632
Oh, God!

01:00:48.665 --> 01:00:51.201
This was uh,
this was a fucking mistake.

01:00:53.937 --> 01:00:55.305
Another fucking condom!

01:00:56.473 --> 01:00:57.574
Oh, shit!

01:00:59.176 --> 01:01:00.377
What the fuck was that?

01:01:00.411 --> 01:01:00.911
Nothing.

01:01:00.944 --> 01:01:01.945
I just pooted, man.

01:01:01.979 --> 01:01:02.413
Relax.

01:01:02.446 --> 01:01:03.647
In my face, man?

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.349
We are in a tube of shit.

01:01:05.382 --> 01:01:07.050
I can't fuckin' breathe, man!

01:01:07.084 --> 01:01:08.051
Come on.

01:01:09.753 --> 01:01:11.622
Uh... My back's all fucked up
right now.

01:01:13.223 --> 01:01:14.224
You know I've got problems
with my knees.

01:01:16.326 --> 01:01:17.227
- What the fuck?
- I know.

01:01:17.261 --> 01:01:18.095
- What the fuck?
- I know.

01:01:18.128 --> 01:01:19.229
- What the fuck?
- I know.

01:01:19.263 --> 01:01:20.964
- So get rid of it!
- I can't!

01:01:20.998 --> 01:01:22.599
If I let it go, it's gonna bite
the shit out of me, alright.

01:01:22.633 --> 01:01:23.967
- Do you want that to happen?
- No.

01:01:24.001 --> 01:01:24.568
- Do you?
- No!

01:01:24.601 --> 01:01:25.736
- Do you?
- No!

01:01:25.770 --> 01:01:27.271
Let's find something
to kill it with.

01:01:27.304 --> 01:01:29.373
I'll go get the car.

01:01:32.109 --> 01:01:33.177
Snake!

01:01:33.210 --> 01:01:36.747
Why do I got to keep
seeing you? Mm?

01:01:36.781 --> 01:01:38.081
What did I say?

01:01:38.115 --> 01:01:39.650
Hey!

01:01:39.683 --> 01:01:42.052
Why do I have to keep dealing
with you and your tiny twin?

01:01:42.085 --> 01:01:43.086
Wait, where's your tiny twin?

01:01:55.566 --> 01:01:56.400
I killed her.

01:01:56.433 --> 01:01:57.501
I fucking killed
her, man.

01:01:57.534 --> 01:01:58.735
Shit!

01:01:58.770 --> 01:02:00.537
Shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit!

01:02:00.571 --> 01:02:02.506
Stop!

01:02:02.539 --> 01:02:04.575
She's fine, alright.

01:02:04.608 --> 01:02:06.143
I'm sure this isn't
the first time she's been hit

01:02:06.176 --> 01:02:08.780
in the head
with a fucking shovel.

01:02:08.813 --> 01:02:11.648
And what the fuck
is your problem, man?

01:02:11.682 --> 01:02:13.617
You're the reason
why we're even in this shit.

01:02:13.650 --> 01:02:14.886
You want to rob people and shit.

01:02:14.919 --> 01:02:17.354
You need to stop it, 'cause
you're not good at it, Jimmy.

01:02:17.387 --> 01:02:19.056
You suck at it, Jimmy.

01:02:25.729 --> 01:02:32.469
A thirty year-old grown ass man
who lives in his dad's basement.

01:02:32.503 --> 01:02:36.440
I've accomplished nothing,
literally nothing.

01:02:39.376 --> 01:02:44.548
Now I'm sitting here
in my boxers

01:02:44.581 --> 01:02:49.419
covered in sewage with fucking
snake semen in my eyes.

01:02:55.425 --> 01:02:56.727
She didn't burn our dicks off.

01:03:06.103 --> 01:03:07.839
I think I'm gonna call it
a night.

01:03:07.872 --> 01:03:09.306
I'm not really
in the mood to party.

01:03:11.375 --> 01:03:13.443
Do you think I could come inside
and take a shower,

01:03:13.477 --> 01:03:15.445
borrow some clothes?

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:17.347
Okay.

01:03:21.218 --> 01:03:23.153
I have someone else's shit
in my ass.

01:03:37.668 --> 01:03:39.536
Hey, ladies and gentlemen,

01:03:39.570 --> 01:03:42.439
can I get your attention,
please?

01:03:42.472 --> 01:03:44.274
What do you think?

01:03:44.308 --> 01:03:46.510
Let's have a motherfucking
dance off!

01:04:00.758 --> 01:04:02.192
Boy, you look goofy as hell.

01:04:02.225 --> 01:04:03.627
What do you have me wearing?

01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:06.163
You look like a 90s lesbian,

01:04:06.196 --> 01:04:08.465
like a blackened blueberry.

01:04:08.498 --> 01:04:10.500
You wanna play?

01:04:10.534 --> 01:04:11.468
Get that, get that.

01:04:11.501 --> 01:04:12.703
Yeah, give me all of that.

01:04:12.736 --> 01:04:13.871
Oh, got you shawty.

01:04:13.905 --> 01:04:14.839
Oh, my God!

01:04:14.872 --> 01:04:15.873
Got you shawty.

01:04:15.907 --> 01:04:16.707
Yeah.

01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:17.741
Yeah.

01:04:17.775 --> 01:04:18.843
Why am I going...

01:04:18.876 --> 01:04:21.645
<i>♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪</i>

01:04:21.678 --> 01:04:25.716
<i>♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪</i>

01:04:25.749 --> 01:04:29.753
- <i>♪ Happy Birthday, dear Jimmy ♪</i>
- Oh, my God.

01:04:29.787 --> 01:04:35.158
<i>♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪</i>

01:04:35.192 --> 01:04:36.159
Birthday?

01:04:37.829 --> 01:04:40.597
So, how you fellas gonna
celebrate this event?

01:04:41.565 --> 01:04:45.535
Well, I had this really cool
party lined up for tonight.

01:04:45.569 --> 01:04:46.804
Oh.

01:04:46.838 --> 01:04:49.239
But your son here's playing
hardball with me.

01:04:49.272 --> 01:04:50.440
It's a high school party.

01:04:51.776 --> 01:04:52.777
Hmm.

01:04:52.810 --> 01:04:54.745
That's fine.

01:04:54.779 --> 01:04:59.383
I was hoping for some father
and son time anyway.

01:04:59.416 --> 01:05:04.889
You know, I think
"Casablanca" is on TCM again.

01:05:04.922 --> 01:05:09.794
I could fix some popcorn
and s'mores.

01:05:09.827 --> 01:05:11.896
We can hang around,
you know.

01:05:12.964 --> 01:05:14.197
Fuck you, Dad.

01:05:21.005 --> 01:05:24.741
<i>Attention Unit

01:05:30.547 --> 01:05:31.849
Goddamn it!

01:05:31.883 --> 01:05:33.350
I'm not even gonna be able
to finish my dinner now.

01:05:41.324 --> 01:05:42.693
Ooh, this place is nice!

01:05:44.594 --> 01:05:46.229
I'll go look for my buddy.

01:05:46.263 --> 01:05:47.698
Alright.

01:05:47.731 --> 01:05:48.732
Do your thing, man.

01:05:48.766 --> 01:05:49.366
Give me that shit.

01:05:49.399 --> 01:05:50.534
Hey, man, that's my drink.

01:05:50.567 --> 01:05:51.735
Yeah, I know.

01:05:52.202 --> 01:05:53.437
I don't want any fights
from you.

01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:55.405
Yeah, I know.

01:05:55.439 --> 01:05:56.440
With your lemon shirt.

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:16.928
Looks like it's your turn,
buddy.

01:06:24.468 --> 01:06:25.669
Holy shit, boy!

01:06:40.550 --> 01:06:41.786
What are you doing?

01:06:41.819 --> 01:06:43.453
- We need to do this.
- Do what?

01:06:43.487 --> 01:06:44.122
- Dance.
- Dan...

01:06:44.155 --> 01:06:44.822
We're not dancing right now.

01:06:44.856 --> 01:06:45.722
Yes, we are dancing right now.

01:06:45.757 --> 01:06:47.657
- Yeah, we are.
- No, we're not dancing.

01:06:47.691 --> 01:06:48.893
- You know why?
- Why?

01:06:51.528 --> 01:06:52.897
What are they doing?

01:06:55.732 --> 01:06:57.334
Always got your back,
and you know it, man.

01:06:57.367 --> 01:06:58.368
I've got your back.

01:06:59.469 --> 01:07:00.303
I've got you.

01:07:15.552 --> 01:07:19.389
<i>No, I don't know
why you're not there</i>

01:07:19.422 --> 01:07:23.094
<i>I give you my love,
but you don't care</i>

01:07:23.127 --> 01:07:26.931
<i>So what is right
and what is wrong?</i>

01:07:26.964 --> 01:07:29.066
<i>Give me a sign</i>

01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:30.835
<i>What is love?</i>

01:07:30.868 --> 01:07:33.403
<i>Oh, baby, don't hurt me</i>

01:07:33.436 --> 01:07:36.841
<i>Don't hurt me, no more</i>

01:07:36.874 --> 01:07:38.642
<i>What is love?</i>

01:07:38.675 --> 01:07:40.978
<i>Oh, baby, don't hurt me</i>

01:07:41.012 --> 01:07:44.347
<i>Don't hurt me, no more</i>

01:08:05.803 --> 01:08:06.871
Lemon.

01:08:09.807 --> 01:08:13.610
<i>No, I don't know
what can I do?</i>

01:08:13.643 --> 01:08:17.546
<i>What else can I say?
It's up to you</i>

01:08:17.581 --> 01:08:19.381
<i>I know we're one...</i>

01:08:19.416 --> 01:08:20.885
I love you, Ace!

01:08:20.917 --> 01:08:23.054
<i>I can't go on</i>

01:08:23.921 --> 01:08:24.688
<i>What is love?</i>

01:08:31.996 --> 01:08:33.130
Why do we not notice him?

01:08:33.163 --> 01:08:35.465
Why can't we join in right now?

01:08:35.497 --> 01:08:37.600
Ace, go Ace, go Ace...

01:08:47.211 --> 01:08:48.444
<i>What is love?</i>

01:09:00.892 --> 01:09:03.593
It's not about how hard
you get hit.

01:09:04.761 --> 01:09:06.162
It's about how fast
you get back up.

01:09:12.002 --> 01:09:12.602
I'm sorry, pal.

01:09:12.636 --> 01:09:14.839
You did you did your best.

01:09:14.872 --> 01:09:16.207
Man, I'm just trying
to show love, bro.

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:19.109
Hey, funny little dude.

01:09:19.143 --> 01:09:20.845
I didn't know you could
dance like that.

01:09:20.877 --> 01:09:22.679
Yeah, well, there's a lot of
things we don't know

01:09:22.712 --> 01:09:23.781
about each other, baby.

01:09:25.615 --> 01:09:27.716
- I crossed the line.
- You absolutely did.

01:09:27.751 --> 01:09:29.486
- I can't call you, baby?
- You definitely cannot.

01:09:29.519 --> 01:09:31.122
You're right.

01:09:31.154 --> 01:09:31.756
You're very right.

01:09:31.788 --> 01:09:32.957
Can we start over, please?

01:09:34.091 --> 01:09:35.692
Sure.

01:09:35.725 --> 01:09:37.560
- Gilbert.
- Ava.

01:09:39.229 --> 01:09:40.563
- Would you like to dance?
- Hi.

01:09:42.499 --> 01:09:43.667
Have fun.

01:10:03.854 --> 01:10:06.123
That was um...

01:10:06.157 --> 01:10:08.192
It's was a lot of fun to watch.

01:10:08.225 --> 01:10:08.893
Thank... thanks.

01:10:08.926 --> 01:10:10.560
Yeah, I've worked on it a lot.

01:10:10.593 --> 01:10:11.695
I can tell.

01:10:13.730 --> 01:10:15.900
Do you want to dance?

01:10:15.933 --> 01:10:18.135
You wa...
you want to dance with me?

01:10:18.169 --> 01:10:19.170
Yes.

01:10:21.072 --> 01:10:22.840
Yeah, just give me one second.

01:10:24.108 --> 01:10:24.976
Okay.

01:10:25.009 --> 01:10:25.776
Cool.

01:10:33.451 --> 01:10:34.819
Where the fuck did that dance
routine come from?

01:10:34.852 --> 01:10:36.220
Okay, so it's a game me
and Neil play.

01:10:36.253 --> 01:10:37.822
No, that is something
you guys rehearsed.

01:10:37.855 --> 01:10:38.621
No, see, no.

01:10:38.655 --> 01:10:40.157
Your timing was tight.

01:10:40.191 --> 01:10:41.859
I don't want y'all to think
we just be in the rooms like...

01:10:41.892 --> 01:10:43.560
You guys do that every night
before you go to bed.

01:10:43.593 --> 01:10:44.261
- 100% right?
- No, no, no.

01:10:44.295 --> 01:10:45.595
Do you know what
I'm saying?

01:10:45.628 --> 01:10:46.797
I believe you this much.

01:10:54.205 --> 01:10:55.940
You're doing great.

01:10:57.607 --> 01:10:58.075
You're doing great!

01:11:06.649 --> 01:11:08.019
Sorry it had to be like this,
bro.

01:11:13.224 --> 01:11:15.159
Oh, my God!

01:11:15.192 --> 01:11:16.559
Oh, my God!

01:11:36.746 --> 01:11:38.315
Aw, man, gross!

01:11:39.716 --> 01:11:40.550
Are you alright?

01:11:40.583 --> 01:11:42.286
- That looked gnarly.
- Fuck you, man!

01:11:42.319 --> 01:11:43.320
Hey, whoa!

01:11:43.354 --> 01:11:44.955
What the hell just happened?

01:11:44.989 --> 01:11:46.323
They pushed the porta potty
in the pool.

01:11:46.357 --> 01:11:47.024
That's a lie.

01:11:47.058 --> 01:11:47.657
Did you fuckin' do this, Chad?

01:11:47.690 --> 01:11:49.226
What? Why would I
do that?

01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:50.693
This guy's our good friend,

01:11:50.727 --> 01:11:52.363
not to mention
hell of a dancer.

01:11:52.396 --> 01:11:53.864
Aw, why would you do that?

01:11:55.299 --> 01:11:56.901
Oh!

01:11:56.934 --> 01:11:58.369
I'm not sorry it
had to be like this, bro.

01:12:01.205 --> 01:12:02.073
Freak!

01:12:02.106 --> 01:12:02.940
This is nasty!

01:12:02.973 --> 01:12:04.741
Get out!

01:12:04.775 --> 01:12:06.143
Get out of my party
right now.

01:12:06.177 --> 01:12:07.812
- What the fuck did we do?
- Just get out!

01:12:09.712 --> 01:12:11.182
Hey, guys, five-O is here!

01:12:11.215 --> 01:12:12.083
Five-O!

01:12:12.116 --> 01:12:14.285
Come on, let's go,
let's go, let's go!

01:12:14.318 --> 01:12:16.120
Hey! Let's go!

01:12:17.922 --> 01:12:18.355
Go!

01:12:20.657 --> 01:12:21.292
Come on!

01:12:24.829 --> 01:12:26.230
Gilbert, come on!

01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:31.102
Oh, shit!

01:12:34.271 --> 01:12:35.106
What are we gonna do?

01:12:35.139 --> 01:12:37.041
Um, come on.

01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:38.708
Come on, come on.

01:12:38.741 --> 01:12:40.677
Wait for me, wait for me!

01:12:40.710 --> 01:12:42.012
Goddamn it.

01:12:42.046 --> 01:12:43.280
I miss high school parties.

01:12:50.955 --> 01:12:51.922
Yes!

01:12:59.763 --> 01:13:00.764
Let's do this.

01:13:03.733 --> 01:13:04.835
That could use some oil.

01:13:06.736 --> 01:13:08.272
What the fuck is
wrong with the garage door?

01:13:10.007 --> 01:13:11.275
Jesus Christ.

01:13:12.276 --> 01:13:12.843
Look at these...

01:13:12.877 --> 01:13:14.178
Yeah, this is a party.

01:13:25.789 --> 01:13:27.424
That was that fat motherfucker
from Food Mart.

01:13:34.064 --> 01:13:35.833
Right? Right?

01:13:35.866 --> 01:13:37.201
Don't you love the sound of
those sirens?

01:13:37.234 --> 01:13:38.869
Yeah, that's why I'm a cop.

01:13:41.906 --> 01:13:43.107
I'm too young to go to jail,
man.

01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:46.243
Ain't going to jail,
not on my watch.

01:13:50.314 --> 01:13:52.883
- Want some?
- Yeah.

01:13:52.917 --> 01:13:54.985
I fuckin' didn't get to finish
my shit earlier.

01:13:56.453 --> 01:13:58.355
Could I have some of that soda,
please?

01:13:58.389 --> 01:13:59.456
No.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.468
Oh, hey, did I tell you
I was cutting out dairy?

01:14:11.502 --> 01:14:12.269
Yeah.

01:14:12.303 --> 01:14:13.237
I noticed.

01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:14.104
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:14:14.138 --> 01:14:15.839
You ask for no cheese
on the burger.

01:14:15.873 --> 01:14:17.041
Yeah, I'm not fuckin' around
anymore, man.

01:14:24.148 --> 01:14:24.915
Goddamn.

01:14:26.984 --> 01:14:28.819
Right? Right?

01:14:33.257 --> 01:14:34.391
What the fuck
are we gonna do now?

01:14:40.864 --> 01:14:43.500
Sorry, kid, shit's about to get
real complicated.

01:14:46.003 --> 01:14:48.405
I will find them and I will kill
them myself.

01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:51.242
It's pretty good.

01:14:55.179 --> 01:14:56.280
Fuck!

01:14:56.313 --> 01:14:58.916
Why would you do that?

01:14:58.949 --> 01:15:00.851
What is your problems, man?

01:15:01.751 --> 01:15:03.287
There's only one way out
of here, man.

01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:04.521
We've got to get creative.

01:15:04.555 --> 01:15:05.856
What you about to do, dumbass?

01:15:05.889 --> 01:15:06.490
I'm sorry.

01:15:07.157 --> 01:15:07.558
Yo.

01:15:07.591 --> 01:15:09.226
Oh, fuck!

01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:10.294
I'm sorry.

01:15:10.327 --> 01:15:11.362
- Why?
- Why?

01:15:11.395 --> 01:15:12.396
- Why?
- Sorry.

01:15:12.429 --> 01:15:13.097
- Why?
- Why?

01:15:13.130 --> 01:15:14.798
- Why?
- I don't know, man.

01:15:14.832 --> 01:15:16.100
I'm sorry, man.

01:15:16.133 --> 01:15:17.501
You just shot me.

01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:24.842
- Why?
- Shit, I don't know, man.

01:15:24.875 --> 01:15:25.976
Why?

01:15:26.010 --> 01:15:27.111
Oh, shit!

01:15:28.279 --> 01:15:29.980
You happy? We've even now.

01:15:30.014 --> 01:15:31.181
Why did you do that?

01:15:31.215 --> 01:15:32.483
I don't know,
I see why you was screaming.

01:15:32.516 --> 01:15:34.318
That shit hurt.

01:15:34.351 --> 01:15:35.519
You got to trust me.

01:15:35.552 --> 01:15:37.521
Let me do the talking.

01:15:37.554 --> 01:15:40.357
Do not say anything
to the fucking cops, okay?

01:15:40.391 --> 01:15:41.458
I mean this shit hurts, man.

01:15:41.492 --> 01:15:42.559
Oh man, I know, nigga!

01:15:42.593 --> 01:15:44.128
I just shot me!

01:15:44.161 --> 01:15:45.429
I know.

01:15:46.163 --> 01:15:49.233
Goddamnit man, I regret this!

01:15:53.003 --> 01:15:53.904
Catch!

01:15:57.608 --> 01:15:58.609
<i>Sorry,
ladies, that concludes the joyride portion</i>

01:15:58.642 --> 01:15:59.576
<i>of your evening.</i>

01:15:59.610 --> 01:16:00.444
<i>It's time to pay the piper.</i>

01:16:00.711 --> 01:16:01.912
Officer, help!

01:16:01.945 --> 01:16:03.180
We've just been shot.

01:16:03.213 --> 01:16:04.181
We need to go to the hospital.

01:16:04.214 --> 01:16:06.617
This... this maniac just
went apeshit on us!

01:16:08.185 --> 01:16:11.021
Told you, inside job.

01:16:11.055 --> 01:16:12.156
You're so good.

01:16:13.290 --> 01:16:16.093
Oh, buddy, you know the drill.

01:16:16.126 --> 01:16:17.027
Gun down on the ground.

01:16:17.061 --> 01:16:18.929
Do it, now!

01:16:18.962 --> 01:16:20.531
Lay down, Apu!

01:16:20.564 --> 01:16:21.498
Do it, now!

01:16:21.532 --> 01:16:22.866
Put the gun on the ground, Apu.

01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:25.436
Do it, now!

01:16:25.469 --> 01:16:26.970
I got a goddamn headache
from that.

01:16:29.506 --> 01:16:32.609
Forgot to give Summer
her favourite chocolate.

01:16:32.643 --> 01:16:35.012
Okay, and who cares?

01:16:35.045 --> 01:16:35.612
It's chocolate.

01:16:35.646 --> 01:16:36.980
She'll live without it.

01:16:37.014 --> 01:16:38.248
Yeah, I guess she will.

01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:44.321
What?

01:16:47.358 --> 01:16:50.294
Neil, I know girls.

01:16:50.327 --> 01:16:53.330
Okay,
you know that I know girls.

01:16:53.364 --> 01:16:56.133
Summer is a normal,
down to earth, girl.

01:16:56.166 --> 01:16:57.368
She doesn't give a shit about
all the bullshit

01:16:57.401 --> 01:16:59.503
you think she cares about.

01:16:59.536 --> 01:17:01.672
And, you know what, Neil?

01:17:01.705 --> 01:17:07.010
As much as I fuckin' hate saying
this, you're kind of funny,

01:17:07.044 --> 01:17:08.579
and you're a super-talented
pervert,

01:17:08.612 --> 01:17:10.047
so just go and fucking
talk to her.

01:17:15.586 --> 01:17:16.487
No fuckin' way.

01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:19.256
Why not? What the fuck is wrong
with you?

01:17:19.289 --> 01:17:20.624
You've literally been beating
off to Summer

01:17:20.657 --> 01:17:22.626
for the past five years.

01:17:22.659 --> 01:17:24.228
I'm not gonna let you give up
now, needle dick.

01:17:24.261 --> 01:17:25.129
Go and talk to her.

01:17:25.162 --> 01:17:26.930
I'm not going back there.

01:17:26.964 --> 01:17:27.664
She's sitting over there
with...

01:17:27.698 --> 01:17:29.233
with shit in her pool right now.

01:17:29.266 --> 01:17:30.334
It's not the right time.

01:17:32.035 --> 01:17:34.037
Can I tell you a secret?

01:17:35.172 --> 01:17:37.975
The right time is now.

01:17:38.008 --> 01:17:39.543
- Jaclyn, stop...
- Now!

01:17:39.576 --> 01:17:41.011
- I can't hit you back.
- Go!

01:17:41.044 --> 01:17:42.179
Stop hitting me.

01:17:42.212 --> 01:17:44.047
Promise to talk to me,
just don't hit me.

01:17:44.681 --> 01:17:46.183
Okay, fine.

01:17:46.216 --> 01:17:47.184
God.

01:17:50.554 --> 01:17:51.989
Just go!

01:17:52.556 --> 01:17:53.424
Fuck!

01:17:53.457 --> 01:17:54.258
Okay.

01:17:55.159 --> 01:17:57.294
Fine!

01:17:57.327 --> 01:17:58.328
Alright, see ya later.

01:18:07.237 --> 01:18:08.605
Fucking clean up my own party.

01:18:08.639 --> 01:18:09.440
Jesus.

01:18:12.409 --> 01:18:13.510
Hey!

01:18:15.646 --> 01:18:17.514
Can I help you?

01:18:17.548 --> 01:18:19.049
No, I live here.

01:18:20.250 --> 01:18:21.518
Can I help you?

01:18:21.552 --> 01:18:23.220
I... it's just...
it's a mess out here,

01:18:23.253 --> 01:18:25.022
so I figured you could use
some help.

01:18:25.055 --> 01:18:27.357
No, I just want to be alone.

01:18:27.391 --> 01:18:28.192
Thanks.

01:18:32.797 --> 01:18:35.666
I brought you a birthday
present.

01:18:38.535 --> 01:18:39.636
Those are my favourite.

01:18:42.172 --> 01:18:42.673
How'd you know?

01:18:42.706 --> 01:18:43.707
Are you stalking me?

01:18:44.575 --> 01:18:46.043
Yeah.

01:18:46.076 --> 01:18:47.744
No, no.

01:18:47.779 --> 01:18:50.714
No, really, I... I mean, like,
I've been through your Instagram

01:18:50.747 --> 01:18:55.052
and ha-harmless online stuff,
but not, uh, not drive-bys

01:18:55.085 --> 01:18:57.087
or anything, anything wild.

01:18:57.721 --> 01:18:58.756
Okay.

01:19:00.624 --> 01:19:03.293
As long as it's just
Instagram stalking.

01:19:06.129 --> 01:19:07.164
Cheers!

01:19:14.238 --> 01:19:17.074
Oh, wow, you got, um,

01:19:17.107 --> 01:19:19.176
you've got like a lot of
chocolate in your teeth.

01:19:19.209 --> 01:19:20.611
Oh!

01:19:20.644 --> 01:19:23.247
It kind of looks like you took
a swim in my pool, Neil.

01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:24.147
Sorry.

01:19:27.251 --> 01:19:29.052
What'd you just call me?

01:19:29.086 --> 01:19:29.787
Neil.

01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:32.222
It's your name, right?

01:19:32.689 --> 01:19:33.724
Um...

01:19:35.692 --> 01:19:36.693
What's wrong?

01:19:44.134 --> 01:19:45.369
What is it?

01:19:47.237 --> 01:19:48.105
Nothing, nothing.

01:19:48.138 --> 01:19:50.707
Um, no I'm fine.

01:19:51.575 --> 01:19:53.143
Mm-kay.

01:19:54.344 --> 01:19:58.682
You know what really pisses me
off about all of this?

01:19:58.715 --> 01:20:00.117
None of this was even for me.

01:20:01.485 --> 01:20:03.287
It was for everyone else,

01:20:03.687 --> 01:20:05.389
because if it was for me
I would have just gone to dinner

01:20:05.422 --> 01:20:06.456
with a bunch of friends.

01:20:07.859 --> 01:20:10.127
Girls really just have it harder
than guys do.

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:11.361
No offense.

01:20:12.596 --> 01:20:14.231
Because we're always trying to
please people

01:20:14.264 --> 01:20:17.501
and avoid the aggressive
douchebags like Chad

01:20:17.534 --> 01:20:19.536
and this new guy named Ace.

01:20:19.570 --> 01:20:20.404
Hmm.

01:20:20.838 --> 01:20:22.139
Dick.

01:20:22.172 --> 01:20:24.809
I hate dicks, but to be
honest with you,

01:20:24.842 --> 01:20:28.545
sometimes I wish I had one,
a dick, like a bigass dick,

01:20:28.579 --> 01:20:30.147
'cause I think that it would
just make my life

01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:31.181
so much easier.

01:20:31.214 --> 01:20:32.215
A bigass dick.

01:20:34.819 --> 01:20:38.622
I don't know if you need a...
a bigass dick, um.

01:20:38.655 --> 01:20:39.824
I hate bigass dicks.

01:20:39.857 --> 01:20:41.391
I... I hate dicks in general.

01:20:41.425 --> 01:20:45.162
I mean, my crazy sister
always says that

01:20:45.195 --> 01:20:47.230
her gender's always
had it rougher

01:20:47.264 --> 01:20:48.766
because historically
they've been treated

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:49.801
more poorly, so...

01:20:49.834 --> 01:20:50.367
Hmm.

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:51.468
I'm-I'm on your side.

01:20:51.501 --> 01:20:52.202
I'm on your team.

01:20:52.235 --> 01:20:52.804
Who needs dicks?

01:20:54.371 --> 01:20:55.305
It's good to know.

01:20:55.339 --> 01:20:56.540
Size doesn't really matter.

01:20:59.710 --> 01:21:00.878
Mm.

01:21:03.815 --> 01:21:05.716
Are you hungry,

01:21:05.749 --> 01:21:08.151
because I know a great place
we could go.

01:21:11.355 --> 01:21:12.924
- There you guys go.
- Yeah, thank you.

01:21:12.957 --> 01:21:15.359
And don't forget that catfish
jelly is really great on it.

01:21:15.392 --> 01:21:16.360
But not too much.

01:21:17.427 --> 01:21:18.161
Neil?

01:21:18.195 --> 01:21:19.162
Hi!

01:21:19.196 --> 01:21:19.897
Hey, Dad.

01:21:19.931 --> 01:21:21.732
Um, this... this is Summer.

01:21:21.766 --> 01:21:22.499
Hi.

01:21:22.532 --> 01:21:24.601
Summer, hey.

01:21:24.635 --> 01:21:26.370
Uh, your girlfriend?

01:21:26.403 --> 01:21:27.905
Nope, nope, just hanging out.

01:21:27.939 --> 01:21:30.908
We've just, uh, we...
we just came for food.

01:21:30.942 --> 01:21:32.676
Oh... okay.

01:21:32.709 --> 01:21:35.545
So a couple of Tobbler Specials
for you maybe, huh?

01:21:35.579 --> 01:21:36.713
Perfect.

01:21:36.747 --> 01:21:37.949
- Sound good?
- Great.

01:21:37.982 --> 01:21:38.950
Okay.

01:21:38.983 --> 01:21:40.384
Oh, and by the way,

01:21:40.417 --> 01:21:42.285
I fixed the lock
on the bathroom door for you,

01:21:42.319 --> 01:21:44.321
so you can stop bitchin'
about that.

01:21:45.555 --> 01:21:46.824
Cool.

01:21:46.858 --> 01:21:47.959
You're gonna get the...

01:21:47.992 --> 01:21:48.760
you we're gonna make the
waffles, right?

01:21:50.828 --> 01:21:52.195
Let me get that, yeah.

01:21:52.229 --> 01:21:52.830
- Whenever you get-
- SUMMER: Thank you.

01:21:52.864 --> 01:21:54.231
Yeah, something special.

01:21:54.264 --> 01:21:55.732
- You're gonna love it.
- Thank you!

01:21:55.767 --> 01:21:57.300
Alright.

01:21:57.334 --> 01:21:59.403
Is the bathroom lock like
a frequent issue for you?

01:21:59.436 --> 01:22:00.905
Oh, no, it's a big problem
in my family, yeah.

01:22:00.938 --> 01:22:04.241
My dad is the most embarrassing
person, uh, in the world.

01:22:04.274 --> 01:22:06.610
- He was sweet. He loves you.
- His goal. His goal.

01:22:06.643 --> 01:22:07.544
Oh, my God, are you kidding?

01:22:07.577 --> 01:22:08.679
I wish my parents would
embarrass me.

01:22:08.712 --> 01:22:11.515
All they want from me is for
me to go into medicine,

01:22:11.548 --> 01:22:13.985
which is like fifteen years
of torture.

01:22:14.018 --> 01:22:17.354
So I'm gonna take a year off
and travel around the world

01:22:17.387 --> 01:22:19.423
and then do the cliché
backpacking across Europe

01:22:19.456 --> 01:22:21.391
to find myself.

01:22:21.425 --> 01:22:22.459
The world?

01:22:22.492 --> 01:22:25.863
That, uh, that's...
that's ambitious.

01:22:25.897 --> 01:22:27.364
Thank God for FaceTime.

01:22:28.498 --> 01:22:29.599
Why?

01:22:29.633 --> 01:22:33.403
You know, so we can, uh,
keep in touch

01:22:33.437 --> 01:22:35.873
and look at
each other's faces.

01:22:40.477 --> 01:22:41.445
Well, what about you?

01:22:42.980 --> 01:22:44.314
- With my life?
- Yeah.

01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:49.653
I... I don't know.

01:22:50.353 --> 01:22:51.956
That's so hot.

01:22:51.989 --> 01:22:54.458
Nothing gets me going more than
a guy with no direction.

01:22:57.762 --> 01:22:59.629
Uh, well I got a...
I got a scholarship to Cal Arts,

01:22:59.663 --> 01:23:03.433
and I, I love to draw,
but I just don't... I don't think

01:23:03.467 --> 01:23:06.971
I can make money
with my style of drawing.

01:23:07.004 --> 01:23:08.405
Hmm.

01:23:08.438 --> 01:23:10.007
The scholarship is amazing.

01:23:10.041 --> 01:23:13.677
Plus I see you drawing on your
iPad all the time at school.

01:23:13.710 --> 01:23:15.980
You... you notice me drawing?

01:23:16.013 --> 01:23:18.281
We've been going to school
together for years.

01:23:18.315 --> 01:23:19.382
I'm not blind.

01:23:23.054 --> 01:23:24.454
Can I see your drawings?

01:23:25.355 --> 01:23:26.356
No.

01:23:26.991 --> 01:23:30.762
No, I just-I just, I don't
show them to anyone,

01:23:30.795 --> 01:23:33.831
'cause they're sort of X-rated
and they...

01:23:33.865 --> 01:23:35.432
they might make me come off
as a psycho.

01:23:35.465 --> 01:23:36.666
Stop being such a fucking pussy.

01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:38.635
Just show it to me.

01:23:38.668 --> 01:23:39.636
You'd freak out.

01:23:39.669 --> 01:23:40.772
I would not freak out.

01:23:40.805 --> 01:23:41.773
You would freak out.

01:23:41.806 --> 01:23:44.842
What about me says that
I'm gonna freak out?

01:23:44.876 --> 01:23:46.778
You promise you won't freak out?

01:23:46.811 --> 01:23:48.445
Swear on my life!

01:23:58.388 --> 01:23:59.791
Promise, you promise?

01:23:59.824 --> 01:24:01.491
Oh, yes, I promise. I promise,
I promise, I promise...

01:24:17.641 --> 01:24:19.309
Can I ask you a personal
question, Jimmy?

01:24:19.811 --> 01:24:20.778
Hmm?

01:24:22.379 --> 01:24:23.848
What does pussy feel like?

01:24:25.817 --> 01:24:27.985
Like putting your dick in some
mashed potatoes.

01:24:29.153 --> 01:24:30.087
Hmm.

01:24:31.388 --> 01:24:32.556
Yeah.

01:24:33.858 --> 01:24:35.358
Can I tell you something?

01:24:35.392 --> 01:24:36.459
Mm-hmm.

01:24:38.830 --> 01:24:40.932
It's been the best birthday
I ever had, man.

01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:44.701
I'm sorry.

01:24:45.970 --> 01:24:47.104
It's okay.

01:24:59.749 --> 01:25:01.018
I've just, uh,

01:25:01.052 --> 01:25:04.621
had a crush on
you for a... a really...

01:25:04.654 --> 01:25:07.024
Neil, just shut up and kiss me
and finger me simultaneously.

01:25:11.595 --> 01:25:14.564
You're...
fucking with me right now.

01:25:14.598 --> 01:25:16.100
Yes, I'm fucking with you.

01:25:16.133 --> 01:25:17.768
- See I knew that.
- You sick porn twisted boy!

01:25:17.802 --> 01:25:18.501
I know, I know.

01:25:18.535 --> 01:25:19.203
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:25:19.237 --> 01:25:20.537
Who the fuck talks like that?

01:25:20.570 --> 01:25:22.139
I know, I... didn't,
I don't even...

01:25:22.173 --> 01:25:25.843
I have never used the word pussy
that many times in my life.

01:25:25.877 --> 01:25:29.646
Jesus, you really know
how to make a girl swoon.

01:25:29.679 --> 01:25:32.549
You know I was gonna invite you
to my birthday party.

01:25:32.582 --> 01:25:33.583
Really?

01:25:33.617 --> 01:25:35.086
Yeah.

01:25:35.119 --> 01:25:39.090
But then you puked on me
in front of everyone, so.

01:25:39.123 --> 01:25:39.891
Yeah.

01:25:39.924 --> 01:25:41.424
Uh...

01:25:42.894 --> 01:25:43.995
Sorry about that.

01:25:47.899 --> 01:25:49.000
I actually don't...

01:25:49.033 --> 01:25:50.167
I actually don't watch
that much porn.

01:25:50.201 --> 01:25:50.868
- I just...
- You don't?

01:25:50.902 --> 01:25:52.669
- No.
- Well, 'cause I do.

01:25:54.138 --> 01:25:55.973
- You do?
- Yeah.

01:25:57.507 --> 01:25:59.944
I can give you passwords.

01:25:59.977 --> 01:26:02.013
You are so much more fucked up
than I thought you'd be.

01:26:05.950 --> 01:26:07.985
Which actually makes
you kind of...

01:26:12.722 --> 01:26:13.758
Kind of... kind of what?

01:26:15.793 --> 01:26:17.094
Cool.

01:26:28.672 --> 01:26:29.907
Cool.

01:27:47.051 --> 01:27:50.121
I don't understand why I'm the
one with handcuffs right now?

01:27:50.154 --> 01:27:52.123
I don't see any bullet holes
in you, Apu.
