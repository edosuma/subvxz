WEBVTT

01:20.881 --> 01:22.450
Who eats
a chili fucking dog

01:22.516 --> 01:24.017
before going out
in rough water?

01:24.084 --> 01:25.319
10-year-old?

01:25.386 --> 01:28.122
Try seven Theta Delts
with tequila hangovers.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.958
Never gonna get this out
of the seams and runnels.

01:31.024 --> 01:33.194
Woody Woodrow
gave me your number.

01:34.728 --> 01:36.530
Alamos Cove.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.366
I told him
the break was for shit,

01:38.432 --> 01:39.667
but he was paying cash.

01:39.733 --> 01:40.834
Surfer. Last week.

01:40.901 --> 01:41.969
Day trip?

01:42.035 --> 01:43.471
No. He stayed over.

01:43.537 --> 01:44.972
Take a lot of gear
out there with him?

01:45.038 --> 01:46.474
Couple of shorties

01:46.540 --> 01:48.709
and some gnarly-ass suitcases
I think were for camping.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.010
He bring it all back in?

01:50.077 --> 01:51.545
Just the boards.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.847
The shit I see,
you learn not to ask.

01:53.914 --> 01:55.749
I don't know Alamos Cove.

01:55.816 --> 01:57.551
Santa Cruz Island.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.253
I need you
to take me out there

01:59.320 --> 02:00.788
where you
dropped him off.

02:02.556 --> 02:04.024
Now?

02:04.091 --> 02:05.726
Give me five minutes
to change clothes.

02:05.793 --> 02:07.528
City paying?

02:07.595 --> 02:09.263
Nobody's paying you
anything

02:09.330 --> 02:10.664
till you
air out that boat.

02:10.731 --> 02:11.932
It is outrageous

02:11.999 --> 02:14.735
that an artist of
Andrew Holland's pedigree

02:14.802 --> 02:17.371
should be subjected
to this kind of malicious

02:17.438 --> 02:19.340
prosecutorial misconduct.
My client--

02:22.042 --> 02:23.244
You got him on tape?

02:23.311 --> 02:25.413
He implicates himself
in everything.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.048
There is no way that Holland
squirms out of this.

02:28.115 --> 02:31.652
Not your worry
anymore, though, is it?

02:31.719 --> 02:32.553
How's that?

02:32.620 --> 02:34.722
Wounded
in the line of duty.

02:34.788 --> 02:36.857
Tax-free medical pension.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.459
You trying to get rid of me?

02:38.526 --> 02:40.961
What? God, no. I'm not--

02:42.062 --> 02:43.096
Hold on.

02:45.132 --> 02:46.200
Yeah.

02:46.267 --> 02:47.901
Lieutenant, I want
to charter a boat

02:47.968 --> 02:50.371
to Santa Cruz Island.
I need your approval.

02:50.438 --> 02:53.140
All right, it sounds like
you're already on a boat.

02:53.207 --> 02:55.075
Great.
I'll take that as a yes.

02:55.142 --> 02:56.610
Bosch, what the fuck?

02:56.677 --> 02:58.579
I think Woody Woodrow
stashed his money there

02:58.646 --> 03:00.214
and Dobbs has been
tracking it.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.582
You see any sign of him

03:01.649 --> 03:03.451
at all, you call in
for backup. Is that clear?

03:03.517 --> 03:04.918
It's just a recon.

03:04.985 --> 03:06.220
Where on the island?

03:06.287 --> 03:07.588
All over.

03:09.156 --> 03:10.458
Bosch?

03:11.425 --> 03:12.826
You know,

03:12.893 --> 03:15.629
retirement's sounding
good right about now.

03:43.257 --> 03:45.726
**

04:04.678 --> 04:07.214
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

04:07.281 --> 04:09.650
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

04:09.717 --> 04:12.686
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

04:12.753 --> 04:14.888
* I got a feeling

04:14.955 --> 04:17.958

* I can't let go *

04:37.445 --> 04:39.613
* I feel *

05:21.922 --> 05:24.792
You bring people
out here to surf a lot?

05:24.858 --> 05:27.728
Middle of the week?
This time of year?

05:27.795 --> 05:29.697
Not really.

05:29.763 --> 05:32.199
All the good fishing's been
over on the other side.

05:32.265 --> 05:34.902
Bring me in
close to that boat.

05:34.968 --> 05:36.604
I want to see who's here.

05:51.084 --> 05:52.252
Rudy.

05:52.319 --> 05:54.388
Bosch, back so soon?

05:54.455 --> 05:55.589
Ms. Benitez.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.057
What's your pleasure?

05:57.124 --> 05:58.125
Skip the formalities--

05:58.191 --> 05:59.460
J. Edgar.

05:59.527 --> 06:02.763
Jimmy Olson here says
you're expecting him.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.264
I just wanted
a quick word.

06:04.331 --> 06:05.599
That's six.
Okay, say goodbye.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.100
- Wait.
- About what?

06:07.167 --> 06:08.669
You.

06:08.736 --> 06:11.605
You kill a guy, next day
almost get killed yourself.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.373
It's gotta be related.

06:13.441 --> 06:15.075
I'm not interested
in being a story.

06:15.142 --> 06:16.644
Sure, but maybe you'd
like to tell one?

06:16.710 --> 06:19.680
Hell, cops get a bad rap
every fuck-up.

06:19.747 --> 06:23.083
Here's a case
where you put your life
on the line for something.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.718
Or someone.

06:24.785 --> 06:27.287
People should hear why.

06:27.354 --> 06:28.956
Or not.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.691
Thanks for your time.

06:32.359 --> 06:33.927
Thomas Niese.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.629
What?

06:35.696 --> 06:38.932
Do some homework
and get back to me.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.470
N-I-E-S-E.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.086
Ahoy!

07:00.621 --> 07:04.525
Trying to embrace
the ancient patois.

07:04.592 --> 07:07.795
Why is he running
the line to the shore?

07:07.861 --> 07:10.230
Keeps you from drifting
around on the current

07:10.297 --> 07:11.532
if you only have
one anchor.

07:11.599 --> 07:13.266
A boat this big
always carries two.

07:13.333 --> 07:15.435
Must have lost
their stern hook.

07:23.376 --> 07:24.745
LAPD.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.981
Anybody on board?

09:31.104 --> 09:32.806
Son of a bitch.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.816
Where would one stow
their aft anchor?

09:42.883 --> 09:44.652
Right in there.

09:50.023 --> 09:51.158
Not there.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.101
I'm going to need
some twine

10:01.168 --> 10:03.503
or some heavy gauge
fishing line,

10:03.570 --> 10:05.639
duct tape, flashlight.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.808
Put it in something
I can carry.

10:32.165 --> 10:35.435
After you drop me off,
head around to the point

10:35.502 --> 10:36.937
and stay out of sight.

10:37.004 --> 10:40.240
Make a sat phone call
to this number--

10:40.307 --> 10:41.641
Lieutenant Billets.

10:41.709 --> 10:43.243
Tell her I've got a suspect
under surveillance

10:43.310 --> 10:45.345
and I'm requesting
backup and air support.

10:45.412 --> 10:47.881
You don't even know
where this guy is.

10:47.948 --> 10:50.250
I know he's coming back.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.320
Can I borrow your lid?

11:14.374 --> 11:16.977
Tell me
about the night of.

11:17.044 --> 11:19.713
We pull up.
Jesse's driving.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.248
The Cadillac.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.183
Caddy, yeah.
Jesse loves 'em.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.351
You boosted it?

11:24.417 --> 11:26.153
Happy to cop
to grand theft auto

11:26.219 --> 11:28.188
if you want to drop
the rest of the beef.

11:28.255 --> 11:29.189
Go on.

11:32.826 --> 11:35.128
...about the night of.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.464
We pull up. Jesse's driving.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.732
The Cadillac.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.667
Caddy, yeah.
Jesse loves 'em.

11:40.734 --> 11:42.435
You boosted it?

11:42.502 --> 11:44.371
Happy to cop
to grand theft auto

11:44.437 --> 11:46.639
if you want to drop
the rest of the beef.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.441
Go on.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.643
...about the night of.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.413
We pull up. Jesse's driving.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.481
The Cadillac.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.716
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

14:35.475 --> 14:36.409
Fuck!

15:09.309 --> 15:13.046
Fucking low-tech
old-school bullshit.

15:13.113 --> 15:14.614
And you bought it.

15:55.422 --> 15:57.690
Have crims secure Dobbs'
boat when it gets in.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.726
Moore's already
working on the warrant.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.294
I found traces of blood

16:01.361 --> 16:03.896
and a tactical knife
stowed under a seat cushion.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.965
Same kind of one
was used on Sharkey.

16:06.033 --> 16:07.600
Ah. Copy that.

16:07.667 --> 16:10.170
Listen, Harry, go do
your FID statement.

16:10.237 --> 16:11.604
I got them to agree

16:11.671 --> 16:13.573
that the walk-through
can wait till tomorrow.

16:13.640 --> 16:17.010
Maddie has been calling
every five minutes.

16:24.751 --> 16:26.086
What if you'd been killed?

16:26.153 --> 16:27.420
I did my best to minimize

16:27.487 --> 16:29.822
the possibility
of that happening.

16:29.889 --> 16:31.091
But still--

16:31.158 --> 16:32.659
What if anything,
Maddie?

16:32.725 --> 16:34.661
Didn't happen.

16:34.727 --> 16:35.828
It could.

16:35.895 --> 16:37.097
Some cops go
their entire career

16:37.164 --> 16:38.698
without ever firing
their weapon on the job.

16:38.765 --> 16:39.932
And then there's you.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.602
Not gonna happen.
Don't worry.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.609
How'd
your tournament go?

16:50.810 --> 16:53.180
We got crushed.
Sunnyvale VC.

16:53.246 --> 16:55.115
They were
freakishly huge.

16:55.182 --> 16:56.716
I'm sorry.

16:56.783 --> 16:58.051
It's what it is.

16:58.118 --> 17:01.188
No amount of practice
makes you taller.

17:13.933 --> 17:15.435
Ho, ho, ho.

17:15.502 --> 17:17.070
Mom.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.340
You weren't supposed
to be here until Christmas.

17:20.407 --> 17:21.774
You want me to go back?

17:21.841 --> 17:22.842
No way.

17:22.909 --> 17:23.876
Aw.

17:23.943 --> 17:25.212
God, I missed you.

17:25.278 --> 17:26.713
And you're taller.

17:26.779 --> 17:27.880
Do not go down that road.

17:27.947 --> 17:29.149
Where are you
and Reggie staying?

17:29.216 --> 17:31.318
Somewhere swanky,
with a pool, I hope.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.719
Reggie's in Shanghai.

17:32.785 --> 17:35.555
I actually hoped
I could stay here.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.257
No problem.

17:37.324 --> 17:39.626
What's Reggie
doing in Shanghai?

17:39.692 --> 17:40.993
Where have you been?

17:41.060 --> 17:43.863
The Billets' house.
Long, long story.

17:43.930 --> 17:45.132
Jerry got shot.

17:45.198 --> 17:46.799
Harry had to
chase the suspect

17:46.866 --> 17:48.000
on to an island--

17:48.067 --> 17:50.137
Okay, it's 3 a.m.
on a school night.

17:50.203 --> 17:52.505
- Mom.
- She's right. It's bedtime.

17:52.572 --> 17:55.041
I'll stay out here.
Your mom can have my room.

17:55.108 --> 17:56.376
That story can wait.

17:56.443 --> 17:58.445
- No, I could sleep out here.
- Really?

17:58.511 --> 18:00.046
This is coming from a woman

18:00.113 --> 18:02.282
who made me spend $3,000
on a new mattress

18:02.349 --> 18:04.384
the last time she moved in?

18:04.451 --> 18:05.318
No.

18:05.385 --> 18:06.719
Come say good night?

18:06.786 --> 18:07.787
Of course.

18:13.326 --> 18:14.727
Is Jerry okay?

18:14.794 --> 18:16.095
He will be.

18:16.163 --> 18:17.930
Look, if this is awkward,

18:17.997 --> 18:19.966
tomorrow I can get an AirBnb

18:20.032 --> 18:21.668
till I find
a permanent place.

18:21.734 --> 18:22.869
You're here for good?

18:24.771 --> 18:27.540
I guess I am, yeah.

18:28.908 --> 18:30.577
Where is Reggie,
really?

18:33.112 --> 18:34.981
Okay. You don't want
to talk about it.

18:35.047 --> 18:36.749
Not tonight.

18:37.984 --> 18:39.452
Thanks, Harry.

18:45.692 --> 18:47.427
The way I'm hearing it,

18:47.494 --> 18:49.462
you went full
Jason Bourne on that rock.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.698
Every joint
in my body aches.

18:51.764 --> 18:53.533
Sorry I couldn't
be there for Dobbs.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.868
No, you're aren't.
You get seasick, remember?

18:55.935 --> 18:58.705
When they kicking you
loose?

18:58.771 --> 19:00.207
Tomorrow, maybe.

19:00.273 --> 19:01.974
Anything I can do for you?

19:02.041 --> 19:03.410
Nah.

19:04.544 --> 19:07.880
Harry, we need to talk.

19:07.947 --> 19:09.382
About what?

19:10.583 --> 19:12.385
In person.

19:14.221 --> 19:16.623
You gonna tell me
you're gonna retire?

19:16.689 --> 19:18.558
Face-to-face.

19:19.792 --> 19:20.760
Okay.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.595
I'll swing by.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.397
All right.

20:02.235 --> 20:04.136
I represent the estate

20:04.203 --> 20:06.973
of the recently deceased
John Caffrey."

20:30.263 --> 20:31.864
John Caffrey.

20:34.367 --> 20:36.369
Detective Bosch.

20:38.838 --> 20:41.541
Mrs. Niese,
I was coming to see you.

20:41.608 --> 20:44.911
No. Got me out of the house.

20:55.855 --> 20:58.057
Here's just a few of his
personal belongings

20:58.124 --> 20:59.326
he left behind
at the shelter.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.394
They didn't know
where to send them.

21:11.203 --> 21:12.872
Dune.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.675
Tommy loved the sandworms.

21:21.481 --> 21:23.750
Christ, I thought
he pawned this.

21:23.816 --> 21:26.018
It was my dad's.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.092
You find who did it,
Detective?

21:33.159 --> 21:34.861
We did, yeah.

21:37.063 --> 21:38.465
You kill him?

21:40.299 --> 21:41.534
No.

21:41.601 --> 21:43.670
But somebody else did.

21:46.939 --> 21:49.041
You have my card
if you need anything.

21:49.108 --> 21:50.943
Yes, I do.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.011
Yeah.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.081
Right this way.

21:57.917 --> 22:00.853
You reliving
your glory years, Bosch?

22:02.221 --> 22:05.024
I maybe saw Malibu once,
growing up,

22:05.091 --> 22:06.926
from the window of a bus.

22:08.495 --> 22:10.262
Caffrey sent it to me.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.964
From the grave?

22:12.031 --> 22:13.800
Sort of. Lawyer.

22:13.866 --> 22:16.736
Instructions
in the event of death.

22:16.803 --> 22:18.438
Why would Caffrey send you
his high school yearbook?

22:18.505 --> 22:21.073
Don't know.
It's not his, either.

22:21.140 --> 22:23.242
Nobody named Caffrey
in it.

22:23.309 --> 22:25.177
Well, before you get
too hung up,

22:25.244 --> 22:26.846
where are we
on Trevor Dobbs?

22:26.913 --> 22:29.816
Just finishing up the filing
package for the DA.

22:29.882 --> 22:32.351
Ventura's got him
on a bus to L.A. County.

22:32.419 --> 22:34.253
- Why?
- Dobbs' lawyer called.

22:34.320 --> 22:37.023
His client
wants to talk to you.
Wants to clear things up.

22:37.089 --> 22:38.591
That'll be a neat trick.

22:38.658 --> 22:40.593
Make sure you get
audio for the jury.

22:47.667 --> 22:50.403
If Mr. Dobbs
is guilty of anything,

22:50.470 --> 22:51.838
it is of possessing money

22:51.904 --> 22:54.306
that has not even
been reported stolen.

22:54.373 --> 22:57.644
That is the total of his
involvement in this matter.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.579
He cannot be
held responsible

22:59.646 --> 23:02.081
for the actions of two
contract employees

23:02.148 --> 23:03.650
who took it upon themselves

23:03.716 --> 23:06.486
to rip off some warlord
in Afghanistan.

23:06.553 --> 23:07.987
He killed
or ordered the deaths

23:08.054 --> 23:10.657
of William Meadows,
Cornell Jackson,
Xavi Moreno,

23:10.723 --> 23:14.561
and Thomas Niese,
a 16-year-old boy

23:14.627 --> 23:16.429
who never posed
any threat to them.

23:16.496 --> 23:18.097
Oh, bullshit.

23:18.164 --> 23:19.699
That is fucking
ridiculous.

23:19.766 --> 23:22.602
That is a wild allegation,
Detective,

23:22.669 --> 23:24.537
and you have no proof
of any of it--

23:24.604 --> 23:27.707
no proof that Xavi Moreno
is even dead.

23:27.774 --> 23:29.909
In fact, he's the one you
should be out looking for.

23:29.976 --> 23:31.978
He's on a beach
somewhere in Mexico

23:32.044 --> 23:35.047
while you falsely charge a war
hero and an innocent man.

23:35.114 --> 23:37.484
Why'd your client try
to kill me on the island?

23:37.550 --> 23:39.486
I didn't know
who was hunting me.

23:39.552 --> 23:40.687
You might've been Xavi.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.722
Sounds like you knew
what he was up to.

23:42.789 --> 23:46.893
Detective, we came to you
today in good faith.

23:48.761 --> 23:51.731
How'd you know I'd work lateral
and come in above you?

23:53.165 --> 23:54.467
I'd have done the same.

23:54.534 --> 23:56.969
It was the tactically
sound move.

23:57.036 --> 23:58.538
Hmm.

23:58.605 --> 24:01.173
And suckered me
into those trip lines.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.842
Calculated risk.

24:02.909 --> 24:05.478
The longer it went,
the less I liked
my chances.

24:08.347 --> 24:09.916
Where's the stern anchor?

24:09.982 --> 24:11.383
The what?

24:11.450 --> 24:12.619
From your boat.

24:12.685 --> 24:14.353
I'm guessing
it's at the bottom

24:14.420 --> 24:15.922
of the Pacific somewhere,

24:15.988 --> 24:18.257
half the chain wrapped
around Xavi Moreno's neck.

24:18.324 --> 24:19.592
Again,

24:19.659 --> 24:23.630
that is a completely
unfounded assertion.

24:24.731 --> 24:27.399
We found blood
in the deck seams.

24:27.466 --> 24:28.935
Match that to Moreno,

24:29.001 --> 24:31.738
and maybe we've got
a no body case,

24:31.804 --> 24:33.405
maybe we don't.
We'll see.

24:33.472 --> 24:34.974
We'll see.

24:37.043 --> 24:40.079
Know what your biggest
mistake was, Dobbs?

24:40.146 --> 24:41.848
Keeping the knife.

24:51.423 --> 24:54.894
It was hidden
under the seat cushion.

24:57.429 --> 24:59.198
Oh...

25:04.937 --> 25:06.205
Hmm.

25:06.272 --> 25:07.439
It's not mine.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.208
News to me.

25:10.643 --> 25:12.545
The lab took it apart
this morning.

25:12.612 --> 25:15.281
They found blood
under the pivot screw.

25:15.347 --> 25:19.018
Seeped in there where
you can't clean it out.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.121
If that blood turns out
to be Sharkey's,

25:22.188 --> 25:24.591
it's "Adios,
motherfucker" for you.

25:29.562 --> 25:31.798
That's
not my fucking knife.

25:32.732 --> 25:34.166
That was Xavi's.

25:36.803 --> 25:38.137
Was?

25:41.708 --> 25:44.944
Doesn't matter
whose it was.

25:45.011 --> 25:46.178
It's who has it.

25:47.313 --> 25:48.480
That's you.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.016
You still have to explain

25:50.082 --> 25:53.252
why it was on your boat
in your possession

25:53.319 --> 25:55.554
when Xavi Moreno
is supposedly

25:55.622 --> 25:57.857
on a beach
somewhere in Mexico.

26:01.127 --> 26:02.228
Yeah.

26:06.098 --> 26:09.568
Anything else you want
to clear up, counselor?

26:12.038 --> 26:13.773
Mr. Dobbs?

26:17.777 --> 26:19.612
Didn't think so.

26:24.751 --> 26:26.152
You know...

26:30.489 --> 26:31.991
there's nothing worse

26:32.058 --> 26:34.661
than a leader who betrays
his own troops.

26:34.727 --> 26:36.195
In country,
that gets you

26:36.262 --> 26:38.765
the death penalty
right there.

26:41.033 --> 26:44.003
But to kill
a 16-year-old boy.

26:44.070 --> 26:45.738
For what?

26:48.307 --> 26:49.508
I'm going to make sure

26:49.575 --> 26:51.343
you live
the rest of your life

26:51.410 --> 26:53.079
in the black echo.

27:23.209 --> 27:25.177
You said you know
who killed her.

27:25.244 --> 27:26.478
He called himself Mitch.

27:26.545 --> 27:28.614
It's the only name
I ever knew him by.

27:28.681 --> 27:30.616
The registers
are in the back,

27:30.683 --> 27:32.651
in the cabinets.

27:32.719 --> 27:34.787
Mitch.

27:34.854 --> 27:37.623
"Fox Mitchell"
was an alias, okay?

27:37.690 --> 27:39.091
He was a snitch.

27:39.158 --> 27:41.427
You've tied Epperson
to your mother's murder?

29:19.425 --> 29:21.994
I was afraid
I would find you here.

29:23.529 --> 29:25.264
Been a month without it.

29:34.606 --> 29:36.042
Talk to me, Bosch.

29:38.577 --> 29:40.579
I should've fucking known.

29:46.152 --> 29:49.856
Arno Epperson,
AKA Fox Mitchell.

29:49.922 --> 29:51.357
The man who murdered
your mother.

29:51.423 --> 29:52.691
Or so I thought.

29:52.758 --> 29:54.626
I mean,
I knew he was protected

29:54.693 --> 29:56.062
by the department
or somebody

29:56.128 --> 29:57.964
who had power
over the department.

30:00.166 --> 30:03.269
Bradley Walker.
He and Arno were tight.

30:03.335 --> 30:04.770
The Police Commission
president?

30:04.837 --> 30:06.638
His father more or less
ran the City Council

30:06.705 --> 30:07.974
for three decades.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.876
Why would
Bradley Walker's father

30:09.942 --> 30:11.043
run interference

30:11.110 --> 30:12.711
and protect Epperson
on a murder?

30:12.778 --> 30:14.947
It doesn't make any sense
that he would take that risk,

30:15.014 --> 30:16.615
not for his son's
fuck-up friend.

30:16.682 --> 30:17.816
I know.

30:19.651 --> 30:20.887
I had it wrong.

30:20.953 --> 30:22.154
You had what wrong?

30:22.221 --> 30:23.355
It was the other way around.

30:23.422 --> 30:24.891
It was all about
protecting Bradley.

30:24.957 --> 30:27.994
And Arno Epperson
was part of it.

30:28.060 --> 30:30.162
You're saying Bradley Walker
killed your mother?

30:30.229 --> 30:32.631
I'm saying
this isn't over.

30:32.698 --> 30:35.134
I'm going to find out.

31:00.526 --> 31:01.860
Hello.

31:06.899 --> 31:08.334
So.

31:08.400 --> 31:11.337
You decided to return
my property.

31:11.403 --> 31:13.472
Nice of you
after a year and a half.

31:13.539 --> 31:15.908
Well, the case has been
under investigation.

31:15.975 --> 31:17.376
I needed to hang on to it
a little longer.

31:17.443 --> 31:21.180
Oh, you return it now,
so case solved.

31:21.247 --> 31:23.015
- Still working it.
- Oh.

31:23.082 --> 31:24.650
Hey, I remember you
telling me

31:24.716 --> 31:28.587
that you were an employee
here since back in '79?

31:28.654 --> 31:31.090
Summer of '69,
to be exact.

31:31.157 --> 31:32.925
I want you to look
at some pictures.

31:40.732 --> 31:43.035
Mm. No.

31:43.102 --> 31:45.437
Can't say as I ever
seen him before.

31:45.504 --> 31:47.106
You sure?

31:48.474 --> 31:50.809
I'm not
a hundred percent sure.

31:50.876 --> 31:53.112
I mean,
it's a long time ago.

31:56.515 --> 31:57.683
How about these?

31:59.751 --> 32:02.421
Hmm. Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

32:02.488 --> 32:04.123
Mm-mm.

32:09.761 --> 32:12.698
Oh, yeah. Him.

32:12.764 --> 32:15.234
Who could forget
that cocky mug?

32:15.301 --> 32:18.170
He used to come here.
I remember.

32:18.237 --> 32:20.606
Chevy convertible.
Party boy.

32:20.672 --> 32:22.874
The pay-to-play girls.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.877
I had to tell him
to keep it down
more than a few times.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.113
When?

32:27.179 --> 32:28.947
Oh, uh, same time:

32:29.015 --> 32:31.017
late seventies, eighties.

32:33.919 --> 32:35.721
But not
with this other guy?

32:35.787 --> 32:37.256
No, no. He was straight.

32:37.323 --> 32:38.957
He liked the loose girls

32:39.025 --> 32:40.459
with the loose legs,
loose morals.

32:40.526 --> 32:42.528
No, I-- I didn't
mean it that way.

32:42.594 --> 32:45.497
I mean, like, did these
two run together.

32:46.732 --> 32:48.367
Not that I remember.

32:50.136 --> 32:52.204
But he rented rooms?

32:52.271 --> 32:53.072
Yep.

32:53.139 --> 32:55.007
That's what we're here for.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.311
His name's
not in the book.

32:59.378 --> 33:01.480
Oh, back then,
if people paid cash,

33:01.547 --> 33:03.615
I never asked them
too many questions.

33:03.682 --> 33:05.917
They could write down "Ronnie
Reagan" for all I cared--

33:05.984 --> 33:07.619
and some of them did.

33:07.686 --> 33:10.756
Nowadays, everybody wants
to pay with plastic.

33:10.822 --> 33:13.125
Oh, I check the IDs on that.

33:16.428 --> 33:17.396
Thanks.

33:17.463 --> 33:18.497
Yeah.

33:57.669 --> 33:59.838
All right.

33:59.905 --> 34:02.641
Walker and Epperson
knew each other.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.143
What does it mean?

34:04.210 --> 34:06.112
It means I had it wrong.

34:06.178 --> 34:08.180
I have a guy.

34:08.247 --> 34:09.615
He identifies Walker

34:09.681 --> 34:11.683
as a regular
at the City Center Hotel,

34:11.750 --> 34:14.286
the place my mother went
the night she was murdered.

34:14.353 --> 34:17.022
My guy doesn't ID Epperson.

34:17.089 --> 34:19.658
But Epperson's alias,
Fox Mitchell,

34:19.725 --> 34:22.128
turns up repeatedly
in the guest register.

34:22.194 --> 34:24.496
- And?
- Walker and Epperson

34:24.563 --> 34:26.132
were asshole buddies
since high school.

34:26.198 --> 34:27.699
There's no reason to think

34:27.766 --> 34:30.035
that they weren't still
hanging out in their 20s.

34:30.102 --> 34:32.104
Walker knows
about Epperson's life

34:32.171 --> 34:35.507
as an LAPD-protected
snitch with an alias.

34:35.574 --> 34:38.310
He uses Epperson's alias
to rent rooms

34:38.377 --> 34:39.878
at the City Center Hotel

34:39.945 --> 34:41.380
for liaisons
with prostitutes.

34:41.447 --> 34:43.915
So Walker
killed your mother now?

34:43.982 --> 34:46.084
That's your theory?

34:47.253 --> 34:49.121
Do you have any idea
how you sound?

34:49.188 --> 34:52.691
I do. But that yearbook
came from Caffrey.

34:52.758 --> 34:54.393
RHD says

34:54.460 --> 34:57.429
Caffrey was the target
of the arson at River Watch.

34:57.496 --> 34:59.465
Somebody wanted
to wipe him out

34:59.531 --> 35:01.300
and whatever he had
in that apartment.

35:01.367 --> 35:03.335
But his lawyer
had the yearbook.

35:03.402 --> 35:05.337
Yeah. And Caffrey kept

35:05.404 --> 35:08.106
a copy of my mother's
murder book somewhere else,

35:08.174 --> 35:09.608
somewhere safe.

35:09.675 --> 35:11.610
And RHD found it.

35:18.650 --> 35:20.319
So, what do you
want me to do, Bosch?

35:20.386 --> 35:22.388
Call RHD. Tell them

35:22.454 --> 35:24.423
you've taken a personal
interest in the case

35:24.490 --> 35:26.057
and ask for a briefing.

35:26.124 --> 35:28.227
When they mention finding
my mother's murder book,

35:28.294 --> 35:29.961
ask for a copy.

35:30.028 --> 35:31.430
I'll take it from there.

35:31.497 --> 35:34.466
You want me to help you
conduct a secret investigation

35:34.533 --> 35:37.736
of the man who is scheduled
to pin the stars on my collar.

35:39.405 --> 35:42.341
Don't you want to know
if that man's a murderer?

35:49.515 --> 35:51.149
I got Daddy's bag.

35:51.217 --> 35:52.551
I called it.
It's not fair.

35:52.618 --> 35:55.221
Jack, you're bigger.
Be bigger.

36:08.700 --> 36:10.902
- Ohh. Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

36:18.677 --> 36:20.346
Mom, can we open the Chee-tos?

36:20.412 --> 36:22.180
- Yes.
- No.

36:22.248 --> 36:24.483
Don't spoil your lunch.

36:25.751 --> 36:27.986
You gonna be okay here
by yourself?

36:28.053 --> 36:29.621
I could get Willis to come

36:29.688 --> 36:31.257
and stay with you
for a couple of days.

36:31.323 --> 36:33.359
Willis? It'd be me
taking care of him.

36:37.563 --> 36:39.431
Tell me you're going
to quit, Jerry.

36:39.498 --> 36:41.800
Take your pension.
Call it a day.

36:41.867 --> 36:44.002
What else would I do?

36:44.069 --> 36:46.772
I don't know.
Sell houses.

36:46.838 --> 36:48.740
Get your Masters.

36:48.807 --> 36:50.709
Watch your boys grow up.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.912
I will. Don't worry.

36:56.348 --> 36:58.083
I like my job.

36:58.149 --> 36:59.518
I'm good at it.

36:59.585 --> 37:00.819
Yeah.

37:03.455 --> 37:05.524
I know you are.

37:07.459 --> 37:09.060
So you go back.

37:09.127 --> 37:10.362
Does that mean going back

37:10.429 --> 37:12.731
to partner with Harry Bosch?

37:23.909 --> 37:25.411
Let's take a walk.

37:26.712 --> 37:28.380
I'll pretend it's exercise.

37:28.447 --> 37:31.216
It's not like poker
is exactly aerobic.

37:31.283 --> 37:32.984
Find a place to live yet?

37:33.051 --> 37:35.654
Everything's so expensive.

37:35.721 --> 37:38.624
We may need you
to move back to Vegas.

37:38.690 --> 37:39.825
Bullshit.

37:39.891 --> 37:41.960
You need to bring me in
all the way.

37:42.027 --> 37:44.596
That was our deal
when you asked for my help.

37:44.663 --> 37:46.398
The Director
is extremely happy

37:46.465 --> 37:47.933
with what you've
accomplished.

37:47.999 --> 37:49.234
You are in,

37:49.301 --> 37:50.969
but in an outside
kind of way.

37:51.036 --> 37:52.804
For how much longer?

37:52.871 --> 37:54.340
How's Reggie?

37:55.441 --> 37:57.376
I don't like keeping
secrets from him

37:57.443 --> 37:59.411
or Maddie, or Harry Bosch,
for that matter.

37:59.478 --> 38:01.947
Look, Jay, I got you
what you wanted.

38:02.013 --> 38:04.716
We're greedy bastards.
What can I say?

38:04.783 --> 38:06.985
You can say "Welcome back
to the Bureau, Agent Wish."

38:07.052 --> 38:08.587
Give me a desk and a badge.

38:09.755 --> 38:10.856
Soon.

38:16.562 --> 38:18.997
I forgot what assholes
you guys really are.

38:23.369 --> 38:26.772
Caffrey kept it
in a safe deposit box.

38:26.838 --> 38:28.073
Extortion?

38:28.139 --> 38:29.941
RHD thinks so.

38:30.008 --> 38:31.543
17 months ago,

38:31.610 --> 38:33.645
Caffrey started making deposits
in his bank account--

38:33.712 --> 38:37.649
5,000 in cash every month,
source unknown.

38:37.716 --> 38:39.985
Right after I went to him
about Fox Mitchell.

38:40.051 --> 38:41.119
Yes.

38:41.186 --> 38:42.554
So Caffrey sends me

38:42.621 --> 38:44.189
in the wrong direction
after Epperson,

38:44.255 --> 38:45.891
turns around,
extorts Walker--

38:45.957 --> 38:48.627
"Pay up or I give
Bosch the true story"--

38:48.694 --> 38:50.962
Walker gets tired
of paying.

38:52.364 --> 38:54.099
All theory, no evidence.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.001
If there's evidence...

38:58.437 --> 39:00.305
I'll find it.

39:00.372 --> 39:02.374
Call me when you do.

39:30.936 --> 39:32.103
Where's Mom?

39:32.170 --> 39:33.805
I don't know.

39:36.708 --> 39:38.343
Dad, we need
to go to the store.

39:38.410 --> 39:39.611
The fridge is bare.

39:39.678 --> 39:42.414
Okay, make a list.
I'll take care of it.

39:42.481 --> 39:45.083
Mom is even worse
about it than you are.

39:45.150 --> 39:46.885
How did you two
ever survive?

39:46.952 --> 39:49.921
Why do you think I know all
the best takeout places?

39:52.958 --> 39:55.761
What are you doing?
I thought you solved that.

39:57.395 --> 39:58.630
I did.

39:59.865 --> 40:01.467
There might be
somebody else.

40:01.533 --> 40:02.968
Just checking.

40:04.169 --> 40:05.370
What?

40:05.437 --> 40:07.606
Must be hard,

40:07.673 --> 40:09.274
going through that again.

40:09.340 --> 40:10.542
Not really.

40:10.609 --> 40:12.744
Ancient history.

40:27.993 --> 40:30.428
Toronto 105-94.

40:30.496 --> 40:31.730
L-T.

40:31.797 --> 40:33.198
Hey,
you going stir-crazy yet?

40:33.264 --> 40:34.265
No.

40:34.332 --> 40:35.534
I'm good.

40:35.601 --> 40:38.904
Look, um,
has Bosch talked to you

40:38.970 --> 40:41.807
about this latest rabbit
hole he's going down?

40:41.873 --> 40:44.442
He's been dodging my calls.

40:44.510 --> 40:46.044
What now?

41:27.619 --> 41:29.588
Of course I want you there.

41:31.189 --> 41:34.159
We just need to be discreet.

41:34.225 --> 41:37.162
There is nothing inappropriate
about this relationship.

41:37.228 --> 41:39.765
I know that. It's just--

41:45.837 --> 41:48.006
Would you
excuse me for a moment?

41:48.073 --> 41:49.307
This won't take long.

41:49.374 --> 41:50.609
Hmm. Of course.

41:58.016 --> 42:00.451
- Bosch.
- Back in '79,

42:00.518 --> 42:02.120
Caffrey got called
to City Hall

42:02.187 --> 42:04.790
to brief a councilman--
Bradley Walker Sr.--

42:04.856 --> 42:06.324
on my mother's case
alone.

42:06.391 --> 42:09.761
It's in Caffrey's copy
of the investigative

42:09.828 --> 42:12.163
chronology, not in the
official murder book.

42:12.230 --> 42:14.299
Is there a summary report
on the briefing?

42:14.365 --> 42:15.767
No, nothing.

42:15.834 --> 42:17.368
The murder book
was sanitized

42:17.435 --> 42:19.104
after Caffrey
met with Walker.

42:23.174 --> 42:26.111
As I've said, this isn't
proof of anything.

42:26.177 --> 42:28.113
The mayor,
city council members,

42:28.179 --> 42:29.948
they ask for briefings
all the time.

42:30.015 --> 42:31.650
Walker Senior's name
in the book

42:31.717 --> 42:33.585
doesn't add up
to extortion or murder.

42:33.652 --> 42:36.054
It's Walker.
I know it. You know it.

42:36.121 --> 42:39.090
Otherwise, Caffrey wouldn't
have sanitized the record.

42:39.157 --> 42:40.926
I suggest you stand down,
Detective,

42:40.992 --> 42:42.694
and see where Bennett
and Pell go with it.

42:42.761 --> 42:44.262
They'll never
get close to him.

42:44.329 --> 42:45.463
It starts with Walker,

42:45.530 --> 42:46.965
then you trace it
back to the torch,

42:47.032 --> 42:48.099
not the other way around.

42:48.166 --> 42:50.969
Bosch,
this is not your case.

42:51.036 --> 42:53.805
It's been my case
since I was 12 years old.

42:54.940 --> 42:56.507
Did you ask Bennett and Pell

42:56.574 --> 42:58.209
for regular updates?

42:58.276 --> 42:59.544
I did.

42:59.611 --> 43:01.680
Let me know
what you know, Chief.

43:01.747 --> 43:03.949
Do that, and I'll
keep you out of this.

43:06.051 --> 43:07.218
Bosch?

43:20.298 --> 43:21.933
Morning.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.368
Morning.

43:23.434 --> 43:26.071
Am I taking Maddie
to school, or are you?

43:26.137 --> 43:29.507
She's driving.
I'm closing my eyes.

43:29.574 --> 43:31.376
I heard that.

43:32.543 --> 43:34.079
How's the house hunt?

43:34.145 --> 43:36.014
I've got four appointments
this morning.

43:36.081 --> 43:37.582
Of course, if there's
anything I like,

43:37.649 --> 43:39.084
I'm gonna run it
by you, Maddie.

43:39.150 --> 43:40.418
Why?

43:40.485 --> 43:42.620
If we're going to live there,
I want you to have a say.

43:42.688 --> 43:44.255
I live here.

43:45.356 --> 43:46.825
Are you gonna eat that cold?

43:46.892 --> 43:48.126
Mom, you have Reggie.

43:48.193 --> 43:50.128
Harry's alone.

43:50.195 --> 43:52.297
Live wherever you want.
I'll come and visit,

43:52.363 --> 43:54.800
but I'm gonna stay with Dad.

44:06.644 --> 44:08.379
What have you done
with my daughter?

44:10.181 --> 44:12.350
You're looking in the mirror.

44:12.417 --> 44:14.519
- That's harsh.
- Not at all.

44:14.585 --> 44:16.722
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

44:23.061 --> 44:24.162
Hell.

44:25.831 --> 44:28.299
Things are so...

44:28.366 --> 44:31.870
It's probably better
that she stays with you.

44:31.937 --> 44:33.338
Why?

44:35.673 --> 44:36.875
Eleanor.

44:39.878 --> 44:41.913
What's going on with you?

44:43.715 --> 44:46.017
What happened in Hong Kong?

45:24.856 --> 45:28.159
Powers,
you volunteer for this?

45:28.226 --> 45:29.961
I did, yeah.

45:30.028 --> 45:32.630
They got a bunch of us,
taking shifts.

45:32.697 --> 45:35.066
I may just learn
to like you yet.

45:55.486 --> 45:56.454
Jerry.

45:56.521 --> 45:57.789
Harry.

45:57.856 --> 46:00.425
Hey.
I didn't hear the door.

46:00.491 --> 46:02.527
Oh. Your security
let me in.

46:02.593 --> 46:04.930
Yeah. Uh...

46:04.996 --> 46:07.498
I can't bring myself
to tell them to go home.

46:08.566 --> 46:09.700
And thank you.

46:09.767 --> 46:11.803
Shit, you didn't have to.

46:11.870 --> 46:13.538
Everybody's
droppin' stuff off

46:13.604 --> 46:15.073
like I died or something.

46:16.541 --> 46:18.143
How you feeling?

46:19.277 --> 46:20.611
On the mend,

46:20.678 --> 46:22.313
staying ahead of the pain.

46:23.348 --> 46:24.916
Working a case
on your down time?

46:24.983 --> 46:27.685
Uh, no, not really.

46:27.752 --> 46:29.387
You catch a new one?

46:29.454 --> 46:31.890
Still writing up Dobbs.

46:32.924 --> 46:34.525
Jimmy Robertson brought me

46:34.592 --> 46:36.261
the Rudy Tafero interview.

46:38.930 --> 46:40.798
Why would he
bring you that?

46:42.567 --> 46:44.135
You tell me.

46:48.039 --> 46:49.440
I'm good.

47:04.923 --> 47:07.225
How'd you know they were
driving a Cadillac?

47:09.627 --> 47:11.396
What are you talking about?

47:12.964 --> 47:15.300
When Rudy flipped

47:15.366 --> 47:17.202
and you led him
through the story,

47:17.268 --> 47:18.503
you slipped.

47:18.569 --> 47:21.839
You asked if the Cadillac
they were in was stolen.

47:21.907 --> 47:23.574
Yeah, so?

47:23.641 --> 47:25.510
How'd you know
it was a Caddy?

47:25.576 --> 47:28.313
It wasn't in the video
that was sent to the Times.

47:28.379 --> 47:30.615
They stole it for that job,
and somehow you knew.

47:30.681 --> 47:32.717
You said Cadillac
before Rudy.

47:32.783 --> 47:34.452
You knew
what they were driving.

47:37.122 --> 47:39.190
What are you doing here,
Jerry?

47:42.027 --> 47:44.229
You sent that video
to the Times.

47:45.763 --> 47:47.899
You had cameras on Gunn.

47:49.367 --> 47:51.702
I was on my way to see
Mark Taylor about it

47:51.769 --> 47:53.271
when I got shot.

47:59.844 --> 48:01.746
You found the camera
in the kitchen.

48:01.812 --> 48:03.748
You got the murder on video?

48:03.814 --> 48:06.151
It would turn this
into a slam.

48:06.217 --> 48:08.219
Cameras inside were dead.

48:09.720 --> 48:12.924
But not outside,
where it got them
going up and in.

48:17.195 --> 48:19.497
The Cadillac's
not in the shot, Harry.

48:22.600 --> 48:24.035
Don't tell me you sat there

48:24.102 --> 48:25.736
and just watched
the Tafero brothers pull up

48:25.803 --> 48:27.238
and go in and kill him.

48:29.074 --> 48:31.609
Oh, man, Harry.

48:34.812 --> 48:37.182
We do what we have to do.

48:37.248 --> 48:38.816
What the fuck does that mean?

48:38.883 --> 48:41.386
Holland's a monster.

48:41.452 --> 48:43.354
So was Gunn.

48:43.421 --> 48:44.789
The Taferos--

48:44.855 --> 48:46.791
We took them all
off the chart, Jerry.

48:46.857 --> 48:48.459
They'll never hurt
anybody again.

48:48.526 --> 48:51.262
But not like that,
brother, not like that.

48:51.329 --> 48:53.031
What has happened to you?

48:55.933 --> 48:58.169
Don't you see
we can't be like them?

49:01.272 --> 49:03.374
I'm not so sure anymore.

49:09.747 --> 49:12.683
Two weeks ago, you didn't
want to be my partner.

49:14.519 --> 49:17.488
Now I'm not so sure
I can be yours.

49:33.071 --> 49:36.441
We pleaded and begged
and bided our time,

49:36.507 --> 49:39.677
and in the end we got the man
we wanted from day 1

49:39.744 --> 49:41.779
to lead our police department

49:41.846 --> 49:43.981
through the difficult
times ahead.

49:44.049 --> 49:45.516
Policing an American city

49:45.583 --> 49:46.784
has never been
more difficult

49:46.851 --> 49:48.619
or more scrutinized,

49:48.686 --> 49:50.455
relations with the community

49:50.521 --> 49:52.857
the department
protects and serves

49:52.923 --> 49:54.825
never more strained.

49:54.892 --> 49:57.628
The example
of how we go forward

49:57.695 --> 50:02.933
and build bridges
of trust and equal justice

50:03.000 --> 50:05.336
will be set from the top down,

50:05.403 --> 50:09.474
and I can think of no
better man for the job

50:09.540 --> 50:11.476
than Irvin Irving.

50:23.388 --> 50:25.390
I ask Mayor Ramos to join me

50:25.456 --> 50:29.694
as we put the stars
on Chief Irving's collar.

50:33.064 --> 50:34.432
Congratulations, Irving.

50:34.499 --> 50:36.101
I knew you'd come around.

50:36.167 --> 50:37.802
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

51:16.107 --> 51:18.576
**
