why he would ruin my life.

have killed your mother?

I-I don't know. Why?

was her adopted daughter.

he would have lied about that?

30:33.839 --> 30:35.514
on Jane Meyerson's murder that I

30:35.551 --> 30:37.865
began noticing several
striking similarities

30:37.902 --> 30:40.829
between Jane's case and
Leopold's known victims.

30:40.866 --> 30:42.021
They were all middle-aged women

30:42.058 --> 30:43.693
who had been stabbed multiple times.

30:43.763 --> 30:45.380
I contacted Adele right away.

30:45.417 --> 30:47.584
I started asking her
specific questions.

30:47.786 --> 30:49.721
I was then able to track Mr. Leopold

30:49.758 --> 30:51.685
using an algorithm I designed.

30:51.763 --> 30:54.855
An algorithm? You have a math
algorithm for solving murders?

30:54.922 --> 30:57.172

Next, we detail the crime scene:

31:15.676 --> 31:17.211
was the body found indoors?

31:17.248 --> 31:19.545
If so, was there signs of forced entry?

31:19.582 --> 31:20.672
Sexual assault?

31:20.709 --> 31:22.365
In Jane Meyerson's case,
the cause of death

31:22.402 --> 31:24.021
was multiple stab wounds.

31:24.147 --> 31:27.373
The program then assigns Jane's
case a seven-digit number,

31:36.136 --> 31:38.287
Yes. I'm almost convinced

31:38.324 --> 31:40.123
Jane was murdered by Carter Leopold.

31:40.160 --> 31:42.896
- Almost?
- One key element is missing.

31:43.027 --> 31:44.474
Leopold had a fixation.

31:44.511 --> 31:47.576
He required his victims
to ask to be killed.

31:47.613 --> 31:50.188
So he contacted them
using an e-mail scam.

31:51.877 --> 31:53.859

- ARTHUR: If the recipient replies,

31:59.951 --> 32:02.191
he stalks and then kills her.

There's no way we can know
if he killed Jane

this theory to us?

to think she's crazy.

37:54.121 --> 37:55.905
Jane Meyerson the same way
that you stabbed

37:55.942 --> 37:57.366
those other five women.

37:57.403 --> 38:00.559
- I didn't do this. I swear.
- Objection. The witness is...

38:00.596 --> 38:03.591
Did you also mean to frame
the defendant, Adele Meyerson,

38:03.628 --> 38:05.490
for the murder of her own mother?

38:05.589 --> 38:07.435
Or was the sloppy police investigation

38:07.472 --> 38:10.045
- just a happy accident for you?
- Objection.

38:10.244 --> 38:11.827
Withdrawn.

38:13.626 --> 38:15.177
I think we're done here.

38:19.971 --> 38:21.529
What just happened?

38:21.661 --> 38:24.052
I think we just found
your mother's killer.

38:40.013 --> 38:41.140
Miss Meyerson.

38:41.177 --> 38:42.536
Please stand.

38:44.186 --> 38:46.685
Madam Foreperson, what say you?

38:46.800 --> 38:47.874
We, the jury,

38:47.911 --> 38:50.794
find the defendant, Adele Meyerson,

38:51.138 --> 38:53.560
not guilty of murder
in the first degree.

38:53.681 --> 38:55.464
JUDGE: Congratulations, Miss Meyerson.

38:55.501 --> 38:57.087
You are free to go.

38:57.160 --> 39:00.013
[MURMURING]

39:00.217 --> 39:01.419
Couldn't have done it without you.

39:01.456 --> 39:03.083
- Thanks.
- This is your victory, too.

39:03.149 --> 39:04.924
Thank you. Thank you.

39:10.242 --> 39:13.013
VIOLET: And now for
our fairy-tale ending.

39:13.293 --> 39:17.732
Our guests are Adele Meyerson
and Professor Arthur Kauffman.

39:17.843 --> 39:19.802
Adele, I will be honest,

39:20.333 --> 39:22.997
I could not have survived
the horror you endured.

39:23.124 --> 39:26.416
I really need to thank you guys
at the Injustice Defense Group

39:26.453 --> 39:28.529
for taking my case.

39:28.567 --> 39:30.150
For telling my story.

39:30.550 --> 39:33.607
And for talking to my hero,
Professor Kauffman.

39:34.153 --> 39:36.208
You people saved my life.

39:42.796 --> 39:44.896
That's great. Let's, um...

39:45.554 --> 39:46.696
Let's take five.

39:46.716 --> 39:48.234
I just have to use the bathroom.

39:48.281 --> 39:49.800
No problem.

39:54.219 --> 39:56.695
I was, uh, surprised
to hear from you again. I...

39:57.012 --> 39:58.817
Thank you. You had, uh,

39:58.854 --> 40:00.738
made your position pretty clear
last time.

40:00.934 --> 40:02.526
Positions change.

40:02.612 --> 40:04.093
And I realized that I wouldn't have

40:04.130 --> 40:06.889
any positions at all
if I didn't win this thing.

40:08.210 --> 40:10.210
And I'm gonna need a lot of money.

40:10.326 --> 40:11.648
[CHUCKLES]

40:11.731 --> 40:14.645
Well, we live in a post
Citizens United world my friend.

40:14.682 --> 40:16.332
I can give you all the money I want.

40:16.599 --> 40:20.007
And, uh, you know,
I'd be happy to, if...

40:20.505 --> 40:21.617
Well...

40:21.654 --> 40:23.704
after a standard review of all...

40:23.757 --> 40:25.289
relevant investigations,

40:25.326 --> 40:27.015
I suspect my staff will recommend

40:27.052 --> 40:28.635
that we discontinue any legal actions

40:28.672 --> 40:30.312
against your interests.

40:31.334 --> 40:34.476
Then let me respond by saying
I will do everything I can

40:34.513 --> 40:36.580
to get you seated in the AG's office.

40:36.778 --> 40:38.394
Thank you.

40:39.031 --> 40:41.617
I look forward to our time
together on the campaign trail.

40:42.388 --> 40:43.726
You're gonna campaign with me?

40:43.763 --> 40:45.004
Absolutely.

40:45.123 --> 40:46.414
I like you, Gore.

40:46.451 --> 40:48.001
And I adore Greta.

40:48.327 --> 40:50.273
So, I think we could have
a blast on the trail.

40:50.328 --> 40:53.070
- Oh. [CHUCKLES] Welcome aboard.
- Yeah.

40:53.149 --> 40:54.557
[BELLOWS CHUCKLES]

40:54.594 --> 40:58.132
I do have a, um... it's a bit
of an awkward question.

40:58.865 --> 41:00.390
Isabel Sanchez.

41:00.720 --> 41:01.995
She single?

41:03.451 --> 41:05.835
So that's why you want
to campaign with me.

41:05.872 --> 41:07.804
Guilty as charged, counselor.

41:08.026 --> 41:09.609
She's a real spitfire.

41:10.048 --> 41:11.992
Don't be offended
if she's not interested.

41:12.077 --> 41:14.796
[LAUGHS] No offense taken.

41:16.383 --> 41:17.915
VIOLET: Okay, so...

41:17.990 --> 41:19.702
I left them alone for a few minutes.

41:19.779 --> 41:21.887
The main mics were off,
but I'd left the room mics on.

41:21.953 --> 41:24.374
- Why?
- I had an instinct.

41:25.060 --> 41:26.819
A bad one.

41:30.895 --> 41:32.735
ADELE [ON RECORDING]: <i>I still
can't believe it worked.</i>

41:32.771 --> 41:34.273
ARTHUR: <i>I told you it would.</i>

41:34.448 --> 41:37.283
ADELE: <i>Planting those e-mails
on the computer was genius.</i>

41:39.407 --> 41:40.965
[ECHOING]: <i>You're my
brilliant professor.</i>

41:41.117 --> 41:43.050
I love you so much.

41:43.208 --> 41:44.590
ADELE: I love you, too.

41:44.687 --> 41:46.054
Damn.

41:46.165 --> 41:48.273
Adele and Kauffman were in it together.

41:48.656 --> 41:50.046
Bellows was right.

41:50.171 --> 41:52.554
Adele was guilty and we
just got her out of prison.

41:52.777 --> 41:55.109
So, we're just gonna
take these... these tapes

41:55.146 --> 41:56.562
to the police, right?

41:56.599 --> 41:58.152
EASY: No. We got her acquitted.

41:58.189 --> 41:59.999
She can't be tried again.
Double jeopardy.

42:00.109 --> 42:02.531
Plus, Bellows will crucify us
for defending the guilty.

42:02.593 --> 42:04.163
He'll hammer it in his campaign slogans

42:04.200 --> 42:05.499
and get himself elected.

42:05.634 --> 42:07.318
Man, they totally played us.

42:07.355 --> 42:08.880
It's diabolical.

42:09.208 --> 42:11.600
That CinderHella is good.

42:11.718 --> 42:13.273
MADELINE: And the cops
will go after Leopold

42:13.310 --> 42:14.601
and they'll find out he didn't do this.

42:14.638 --> 42:16.476
We can still get this Professor Con Job

42:16.513 --> 42:18.163
for accessory after the fact, right?

42:18.200 --> 42:19.825
Attorney-client privilege.

42:19.895 --> 42:22.296
We can't implicate him
without implicating her.

42:22.447 --> 42:24.296
We can't do anything. We're screwed.

42:26.469 --> 42:28.561
VIOLET: <i>It is the ethical
obligation of every lawyer</i>

42:28.598 --> 42:31.390
<i>to mount a compelling defense
for their client.</i>

42:31.462 --> 42:34.382
Of course we hope to exonerate
only the innocent.

42:34.419 --> 42:36.793
<i>But sometimes the system fails</i>

42:36.830 --> 42:38.547
<i>and the guilty are set free.</i>

42:39.004 --> 42:41.921
Now, lawyers are forbidden
to betray their clients,

42:41.958 --> 42:43.941
<i>innocent or guilty.</i>

42:44.368 --> 42:47.293
<i>But for those of us who aren't lawyers,</i>

42:47.429 --> 42:50.273
<i>we know that if a person
gets away with a crime,</i>

42:50.361 --> 42:52.554
there's a good chance
they'll commit another.

42:53.242 --> 42:55.110
<i>And when they do,</i>

42:55.714 --> 42:57.773
<i>we will be right there to catch them.</i>

43:03.976 --> 43:05.343
Hey.

43:05.423 --> 43:06.749
Listen, I've been trying to call you.

43:06.786 --> 43:10.117
I am so sorry, okay?
Joe ran that story, not me.

43:10.199 --> 43:11.499
I tried to get him to stop it...
