00:08.275 --> 00:10.476
Previously on "Mr. Mercedes"...
It's registered to

00:10.477 --> 00:12.411
a Mrs. Olivia Trelawney
in Sugar Heights.

00:12.412 --> 00:16.282
My sister?
It's completely unlike her

00:16.283 --> 00:18.551
to leave her keys in her car,

00:18.552 --> 00:22.021
and if she said she didn't,
she didn't.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.890
I mean, you need I.T. help,
Mr. Hodges. Come on.

00:23.891 --> 00:25.491
Well, I won't be getting it
from you.

00:25.492 --> 00:27.426
I mean it.

00:27.427 --> 00:28.561
"Dear Olivia Trelawney,"

00:28.562 --> 00:30.696
I am the man who
stole your Mercedes.

00:30.697 --> 00:33.833
Had you not left your keys
in the ignition,

00:33.834 --> 00:34.901
"perhaps none of this
would've happened."

00:34.902 --> 00:37.036
I promise you,
the police don't give a shit.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.104
This is our guy.

00:38.105 --> 00:40.506
He sends me messages
through my computer.

00:40.507 --> 00:42.975
Your PC is talking to you?

00:42.976 --> 00:45.311
What are we up to here,
you and me?

00:45.312 --> 00:49.048
The actual Mercedes
killer was taken into custody.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.517
He had details that only
the actual killer could've had.

00:51.518 --> 00:53.319
Good night, Mr. Nothing.

00:53.320 --> 00:59.192
You stupid, fat, dead fuck.

01:18.345 --> 01:22.748
The wind turns like a dagger.

01:22.749 --> 01:26.018
The rain falls like a hammer.

01:26.019 --> 01:29.088
The sky has grown dark.

01:29.089 --> 01:32.292
But it's not too late.

01:34.494 --> 01:38.431
The weather crashes down.

01:38.432 --> 01:42.902
What's lost cannot be found.

01:42.903 --> 01:45.104
The night is closing.

01:45.105 --> 01:48.342
But it's not too late.

01:49.242 --> 01:52.178
It's not too late.

01:52.179 --> 01:55.382
It's not too late.

01:57.851 --> 02:01.320
The atmosphere is lethal.

02:01.321 --> 02:05.459
But I will fear no evil.

03:12.926 --> 03:15.327
Liberal media
will never get it because

03:15.328 --> 03:17.664
they hide in their penthouses
in Manhattan and they...

03:28.208 --> 03:31.877
The only way to fight
this enemy is with hate.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.279
If liberals had their way,

03:33.280 --> 03:36.882
they'd play football with tus
instead of uniforms

03:36.883 --> 03:40.553
and fight wars with love beads
rather than guns and bullets.

03:40.554 --> 03:41.987
These people make me sick!

03:41.988 --> 03:43.689
They should make you sick, too,
because soon...

03:43.690 --> 03:45.157
You will succeed.

03:45.158 --> 03:46.226
Won't recognize...

04:08.915 --> 04:10.783
There you are.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.586
Good morning.

04:26.133 --> 04:27.600
Hi, are you Ryan Springhill?

04:27.601 --> 04:29.735
Why?

04:29.736 --> 04:31.871
Are you Ryan Springhill?

04:31.872 --> 04:34.406
Sure, why?

04:34.407 --> 04:35.942
You've been served, Ryan.
Cheers.

05:02.369 --> 05:05.638
Take my family away from me.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.307
Take everything away from me.

05:14.181 --> 05:15.782
Byebye.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.399
You incompetent dyke.

05:44.144 --> 05:46.612
I know.

05:46.613 --> 05:49.349
Even I don't know what
I'm gonna do half the time.

05:55.055 --> 05:57.056
I don't know.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.425
When I'm gonna find it

05:59.426 --> 06:01.961
I don't know.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.762
But it's somewhere

06:03.763 --> 06:06.632
I don't know.

06:06.633 --> 06:08.834
But I'm gonna find it.

06:08.835 --> 06:12.004
Soon, yeah.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.506
Get along.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.276
Yeah, I mean,
I'm having a bit of trouble

06:50.277 --> 06:52.211
with the idea
that someone as organized

06:52.212 --> 06:56.148
and, um, circumspect as you

06:56.149 --> 06:58.484
could leave the key to
a Mercedes in the ignition.

06:58.485 --> 07:01.754
Yet there was no sign
of forced entry.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.222
The killer didn't break
into your car, ma'am.

07:03.223 --> 07:04.757
But he did.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.959
No, he didn't.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.894
I didn't leave my keys
in the car.

07:08.895 --> 07:10.696
Then you must have
handed them to him.

07:10.697 --> 07:12.431
No.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.833
"No"? 16 people are dead...

07:14.834 --> 07:16.568
What do you want me
to do about it?

07:16.569 --> 07:17.337
What?

07:17.338 --> 07:19.338
I didn't kill anybody.

07:19.339 --> 07:23.575
I'm sorry they're dead, yes,
but they're no different to me

07:23.576 --> 07:25.644
than the 16 people who died
in Iraq today or...

07:25.645 --> 07:28.647
Or in that flood in India,
or wherever 16 people

07:28.648 --> 07:31.583
have died stupidly
and horribly today.

07:31.584 --> 07:32.985
You want me to
profess kinship with them,

07:32.986 --> 07:34.987
and when I can't,
you demand guilt,

07:34.988 --> 07:37.589
and when I say I'm not
guilty of anything,

07:37.590 --> 07:40.125
you still flay the flesh
from my bones regardless,

07:40.126 --> 07:41.860
because I own a Mercedes

07:41.861 --> 07:44.397
and because I don't
mourn strangers properly.

07:48.935 --> 07:50.336
I have to give my mother
her lunch now.

07:50.337 --> 07:52.872
Is... is...
Is there anything else?

08:00.213 --> 08:01.881
We'll see ourselves out.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.157
Um, when will I get it back?

08:12.158 --> 08:13.692
Excuse me?

08:13.693 --> 08:15.828
My Mercedes.
When will I get it back?

08:15.829 --> 08:17.696
You're seriously asking this?

08:17.697 --> 08:19.765
Well, I don't have any other
method of transportation.

08:19.766 --> 08:21.367
Rent a car.

08:21.368 --> 08:23.235
I have. It's expensive.

08:23.236 --> 08:24.570
Keep the receipts.

08:24.571 --> 08:25.604
Ma'am, you car was used in a...

08:25.605 --> 08:30.109
I know what it was used for.
Clearly.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.977
I need to know
when I'm gonna get my car back.

08:32.979 --> 08:35.847
You don't impound vehicles
indefinitely, do you?

08:35.849 --> 08:39.451
In this case, we might.

08:39.452 --> 08:41.520
I have needs, officers.

08:41.520 --> 08:44.323
Ma'am, we're detectives,
and you may be...

08:44.324 --> 08:47.192
Mrs. Trelawney...

08:47.193 --> 08:50.596
you can go down to headquarters
on Ridge Avenue,

08:50.597 --> 08:53.399
and fill out
a stolen/recovered form.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.400
And they'll give me my car back?

08:54.401 --> 08:55.868
Want to say 10:00 a.m.?

08:55.869 --> 08:57.936
Tomorrow?

08:57.937 --> 08:59.271
Why not?

08:59.272 --> 09:02.475
That... that's wonderful.
Thank you.

09:08.281 --> 09:12.684
Worth every minute, baby.

09:12.685 --> 09:14.219
Makes my day.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.889
Makes my day.

09:19.025 --> 09:21.895
Great idea, Hodges.

10:12.345 --> 10:13.479
I am so sorry.

10:13.480 --> 10:16.349
Fuck out of the way, guy.

10:19.285 --> 10:22.020
Guess what just shit the bed in
the middle of a crucial project.

10:22.021 --> 10:23.489
You said it was fixed,
but it's worse.

10:23.490 --> 10:27.025
Um, I said I hoped it was fixed,

10:27.026 --> 10:29.161
but I suspected that
the circuit board was fried.

10:29.162 --> 10:32.164
I recommended that you replace
the entire hard drive,

10:32.165 --> 10:33.966
which would take a week,

10:33.967 --> 10:35.367
and you said that
you couldn't wait.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.369
You didn't say any of that.

10:37.370 --> 10:40.038
I did. You didn't, twat.

10:40.039 --> 10:43.575
Sir, I have shown you
nothing but respect.

10:43.576 --> 10:45.844
Why don't we
keep it professional?

10:45.845 --> 10:47.379
Professional is doing your job.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.982
You and your tit tats
and your vag rings

10:49.983 --> 10:52.317
and your Subaru Outback might
want to look up the definition.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.253
Yeah, I don't get paid enough...

10:54.254 --> 10:57.789
To do your job, but you do,
and you're going to.

10:57.790 --> 10:59.992
Stop eyeballing me,
you dickless wonder.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.593
Can I help you?

11:01.594 --> 11:02.628
Morning, sir. I'm Ryan.

11:02.629 --> 11:04.263
Yeah, I'm, Anthony Frobisher.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.798
You're the manager.
I am, sir, yes.

11:06.799 --> 11:08.600
I'm just trying to explain
to your employees

11:08.601 --> 11:10.002
that I'm unhappy
with the way my laptop

11:10.003 --> 11:12.404
was improperly serviced
last time by this young lady.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.806
I, heard raised voices.

11:14.807 --> 11:16.875
Yeah. Guilty as charged.

11:16.876 --> 11:19.745
I'm upset 'cause it cost me
a big project at work

11:19.746 --> 11:21.146
and my company sends
a lot of work your way,

11:21.147 --> 11:26.885
but this experience will give us
pause next time, I'm afraid.

11:26.886 --> 11:27.754
Ryan Springhill.

11:27.755 --> 11:29.254
Yes, sir.

11:29.255 --> 11:31.223
You work with
Johnson Construction.

11:31.224 --> 11:33.959
I sure do.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.961
We'll have it back to you
tomorrow night.

11:35.962 --> 11:37.162
This young lady said
it would take a week

11:37.163 --> 11:38.597
to replace the mother...

11:38.598 --> 11:39.898
The motherboard?
Yeah, well, normally it would,

11:39.899 --> 11:41.833
but I'm gonna put
a special rush on this

11:41.834 --> 11:43.302
so you know how much
we value your business.

11:43.303 --> 11:45.437
Well, I appreciate that
very much,

11:45.438 --> 11:48.373
and apologies
for raising my voice.

11:48.374 --> 11:51.376
Not necessary.

11:51.377 --> 11:54.513
Perfectly understandable.

11:54.514 --> 11:56.348
See you tomorrow at 9:00.

11:56.349 --> 11:58.917
If you find the door locked,
we won't have gone home.

11:58.918 --> 12:00.185
Just ring the bell.

12:00.186 --> 12:01.921
Will do.

12:23.209 --> 12:27.279
Sound like I hear
that wolf howling.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.048
Yeah, he howling.

12:37.290 --> 12:40.959
I need cash for gas,
my good man.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.027
What do you need gas for?

12:42.028 --> 12:43.895
Your lawnmower.

12:43.896 --> 12:45.030
I fired you.

12:45.031 --> 12:48.066
Yeah, but you didn't mean it.

12:48.067 --> 12:48.935
You base this on what?

12:48.936 --> 12:50.836
I mean,
who else are you gonna find

12:50.837 --> 12:52.904
who's gonna tell you about,
I don't know,

12:52.905 --> 12:56.308
computer code, hacking.

12:56.309 --> 12:59.578
Look, I won't tell
my father anything,

12:59.579 --> 13:04.651
and I'll step back
if it gets too sketchy, okay?

13:09.122 --> 13:11.189
Cool.

13:11.190 --> 13:14.393
Well, you know they
can't see me late at night.

13:14.394 --> 13:17.063
But they hear me when I howl.

13:35.948 --> 13:38.750
This is him, isn't it?

13:38.751 --> 13:39.751
Get away from there.

13:39.752 --> 13:42.487
Get away from it.
Get away from it.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.489
I mean, you read about
that kind of stuff,

13:44.490 --> 13:45.891
you hear about it, but...

13:45.892 --> 13:47.626
Most people never see it.

13:47.627 --> 13:51.497
They regret it when they do,
because you can't unsee it.

13:59.305 --> 14:02.175
You know, I bet she didn't
leave her key in the ignition.

14:06.245 --> 14:09.648
She didn't seem the type,
I grant you.

14:09.649 --> 14:11.383
But how else did he gain access?

14:11.384 --> 14:12.251
We checked.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.386
He didn't pick the lock.

14:14.387 --> 14:17.789
He didn't hotwire the ignition.

14:17.790 --> 14:20.125
The worst fight
my parents ever had,

14:20.126 --> 14:22.928
my father found out
that my mother had been

14:22.929 --> 14:24.596
driving around her new car
for six months

14:24.597 --> 14:27.032
with a spare key
in the glove compartment.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.533
I mean,
she didn't even know about it.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.736
It was still in the plastic wrap
from the dealership,

14:30.737 --> 14:33.038
with the owner's manual
and all that.

14:33.039 --> 14:36.041
That's a stretch for our guy,
though.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.075
He'd have to know
it was sitting there

14:37.076 --> 14:38.810
since Olivia
drove it off the lot,

14:38.811 --> 14:39.811
what, 10 years before?

14:39.812 --> 14:42.614
Unless he was a mechanic,
or a valet,

14:42.615 --> 14:44.750
or anybody with
easy access to the car

14:44.751 --> 14:47.086
to find the spare key
in the glove box, right?

14:49.956 --> 14:50.423
Not bad.

14:50.424 --> 14:53.024
Not bad.

14:53.025 --> 14:54.893
I'll look into it.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.161
Yeah? You'll look into it?

14:56.162 --> 14:57.230
Yeah. Get the fuck out.

14:59.365 --> 15:00.365
All right.

15:22.989 --> 15:26.525
It's where the top three
are sitting right now,

15:26.526 --> 15:30.263
and Mark has moved up into
fourth place all by himself.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.270
I thought you were driving it
to tech supply.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.138
Yep.

15:40.139 --> 15:42.274
So why wrap it?

15:42.275 --> 15:46.211
Ask fucking Robi.

15:46.212 --> 15:48.880
Hey, you know, I got it running
for a few minutes.

15:48.881 --> 15:52.284
You know why it keeps crashing?

15:52.285 --> 15:53.285
Porn?

15:53.286 --> 15:55.086
Surprisingly, no.

15:55.087 --> 15:58.156
He likes to go
to these whitepower sites

15:58.157 --> 16:02.494
that send him phantom redirects
to exploit kits.

16:02.495 --> 16:06.832
He's a big fan
of pictures of lynchings

16:06.833 --> 16:11.903
and reading up on handy ways
to subdue the mud races

16:11.904 --> 16:16.174
and kill all the fags.

16:16.175 --> 16:18.310
I don't know what's wrong
with people sometimes.

16:18.311 --> 16:21.380
Right?

16:23.115 --> 16:25.116
Fuck.

16:25.117 --> 16:28.254
There's a lot of mean
out there, you know?

16:43.603 --> 16:46.005
I'm sorry.

16:48.741 --> 16:51.409
Can I get you something?

16:51.410 --> 16:54.680
You're so frigging sweet, Brady.

16:56.616 --> 16:59.050
No, really.

16:59.051 --> 17:03.823
You didn't even react when
he called you a dickless wonder.

17:05.223 --> 17:06.558
He called me that?

17:06.559 --> 17:10.362
Yeah. Yeah.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.297
It's weird. Sometimes,

17:12.298 --> 17:15.165
you know, in conflict,

17:15.166 --> 17:19.003
my mind just kind of checks out.

17:19.005 --> 17:21.507
I just kind of float away.

17:22.308 --> 17:23.843
So you don't rember?

17:26.244 --> 17:27.378
Yeah.

17:27.380 --> 17:30.582
Now... now I do.

17:30.583 --> 17:36.589
He said, "Stop eyeballing me,
you dickless wonder," right?

17:38.524 --> 17:41.259
He's probably just
a very sad man.

17:41.260 --> 17:46.464
What, that he needs
like a hug or something?

17:46.465 --> 17:49.334
Or a little understanding?

17:49.335 --> 17:51.202
Fuck him.

17:51.203 --> 17:53.738
Tell me how you really feel.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.740
Like rigging up his laptop
so the next time

17:55.741 --> 17:58.143
it's on his lap
and he hits "return,"

17:58.144 --> 17:59.477
it fucking explodes.

17:59.478 --> 18:01.413
Then who'd be a dickless wonder?

18:01.414 --> 18:03.616
Exactafuckingmundo.

18:07.286 --> 18:09.821
Thank you for cheering me up.

18:09.822 --> 18:12.223
I'll let you get back
to your lunch.

18:12.224 --> 18:14.894
Sure.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.297
Tee shot off the 14th.

18:19.298 --> 18:22.167
And as you can see,
at 295 yards,

18:22.168 --> 18:24.836
right in the middle
of the fairway.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.972
Meanwhile,
as we look at the 13th hole,

18:26.973 --> 18:29.307
here's Nichols,
and just didn't get it

18:29.308 --> 18:33.445
and it lies off in the high
grass on the right side.

18:33.446 --> 18:34.512
Here's the green...

18:40.653 --> 18:42.854
Here today for round number one.

18:42.855 --> 18:46.524
It is beautiful and 83,
but as the weekend comes on,

18:46.525 --> 18:49.794
it's going to get
cloudy and cooler

18:49.795 --> 18:53.131
with the wind picking up
on Sunday,

18:53.132 --> 18:55.333
and that could be a huge factor

18:55.334 --> 18:58.937
on the final day
of the competion.

18:58.938 --> 19:02.340
We have Colby at minus 7,
Hagen at minus 4.

19:02.341 --> 19:04.542
All right, so we're good
on the mural, though?

19:04.543 --> 19:06.011
Yeah, It's almost finished.
It looks great.

19:06.012 --> 19:07.879
How about music?

19:07.880 --> 19:09.280
Allagash Middle Choir said
they could take the sixth slot.

19:09.281 --> 19:12.150
The troupe from Thomas Jefferson
said that two of their dancers

19:12.151 --> 19:14.352
have a stomach bug but should
be fine by the night of.

19:14.353 --> 19:16.621
What about a play?
We have to have a play.

19:16.622 --> 19:18.123
The drama club's in.

19:18.124 --> 19:19.991
They got a trophy
for their play.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.027
All right, well, so,
fingers crossed, right, guys?

19:22.028 --> 19:25.296
Put down on the sixth slot that,
um, we're set.

19:25.297 --> 19:28.900
Okay, so I was thinking,
um, for slot four...

19:28.901 --> 19:30.369
It was, um...

19:33.773 --> 19:35.573
Hey, buddy.

19:35.574 --> 19:36.308
What's up, man?

19:36.309 --> 19:38.577
We should have, um...

19:40.246 --> 19:43.581
Black coffee,
two sugars, please.

19:43.582 --> 19:44.716
Who's that?

19:44.717 --> 19:45.917
Just the icecream truck guy.

19:45.918 --> 19:47.552
Yeah, yeah.

19:47.553 --> 19:48.987
It's like running into
your teacher out of school.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.990
It feels weird somehow.

19:52.658 --> 19:53.978
Yeah, I can't relate to that,
man.

20:42.441 --> 20:46.512
Stop. Stop, both of you.

21:20.746 --> 21:22.815
Let's go, let's go!

21:24.216 --> 21:25.551
Let's go, let's go!

21:27.686 --> 21:28.888
Let's go, let's go!

21:30.823 --> 21:32.557
Let's go!

21:32.558 --> 21:34.827
Woo!

21:35.561 --> 21:37.763
Deb!

22:01.854 --> 22:02.854
Gorgeous dog.

22:18.871 --> 22:20.672
What's up, Ma?

22:20.673 --> 22:23.142
Nothing. Just sitting.

22:25.878 --> 22:27.478
Big day tomorrow.

22:27.479 --> 22:29.814
You're coming, right?

22:29.815 --> 22:32.016
You promised.

22:32.017 --> 22:34.220
"We'll fucking see," I said.

22:44.964 --> 22:46.431
Hello?

22:46.432 --> 22:48.066
Hey. You near your car?

22:48.067 --> 22:50.635
It's parked out front. Why?

22:50.636 --> 22:52.237
Well, I was talking
to some friends

22:52.238 --> 22:56.507
who know how to break into a car
without leaving a trace.

22:56.508 --> 22:58.109
What kind of friends are these?

22:58.110 --> 23:00.111
Geeks who want to grow up
to be Bond villains.

23:00.112 --> 23:02.448
Listen, punch your fob
and unlock your car.

23:05.317 --> 23:07.720
Just made me breakfast.

23:15.527 --> 23:16.728
Okay.

23:16.729 --> 23:17.729
All right, your car is now open?

23:17.730 --> 23:19.664
Well, color me dazzled.

23:19.665 --> 23:21.132
Lock it.

23:21.133 --> 23:22.200
Come on.

23:22.201 --> 23:25.037
Come on, just lock it.

23:26.472 --> 23:28.006
It's locked.

23:28.007 --> 23:29.540
That it?

23:29.541 --> 23:32.677
Now, your fob
is part of a PKE system.

23:32.678 --> 23:34.545
It's passive keyless entry.
It's pretty simple.

23:34.546 --> 23:36.681
The fob emits a lowfrequency
radio signal

23:36.682 --> 23:38.383
that passes through the air

23:38.384 --> 23:40.018
and connects to a receiver
in your car.

23:40.019 --> 23:41.586
Now... now, it's...

23:41.587 --> 23:43.688
It's this kind of genius
that got you into Harvard.

23:43.689 --> 23:44.889
Don't be modest, now.

23:44.890 --> 23:46.724
Ha ha.

23:46.725 --> 23:48.293
Look, once that radio signal
passes through the air,

23:48.294 --> 23:49.560
it's pretty easy to snatch it

23:49.561 --> 23:51.162
once you have the right tool,

23:51.163 --> 23:53.031
and all those components
need for it,

23:53.032 --> 23:55.366
you can find it at
any electronics store.

23:55.367 --> 23:58.836
So you're saying, like,
if somebody walks past me,

23:58.837 --> 23:59.638
they can clone my fob.

23:59.639 --> 24:01.172
No, no, not clone.

24:01.173 --> 24:02.707
I'm talking about snatch.

24:02.708 --> 24:04.575
Look, once you point
your fob at your car

24:04.576 --> 24:07.645
and you press that button
and the signal hits the ether,

24:07.646 --> 24:10.915
anyone within a hundred yards
who has the proper equipment

24:10.916 --> 24:13.518
can just, like,
snatch up the codes.

24:13.519 --> 24:16.187
Go back to school.

24:16.188 --> 24:18.656
It's summertime. School's out.

24:18.657 --> 24:20.858
Go back to something, then.

24:20.859 --> 24:22.995
[] Yeah, I'm already gone.

24:35.341 --> 24:39.043
Now there's a man
with a bounce in his step.

24:39.044 --> 24:40.412
Owe it all to you, Ida.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.031
You on today?

25:00.032 --> 25:03.234
4:00 to 12:00.

25:03.235 --> 25:06.637
And how is the
records department these days?

25:06.638 --> 25:09.841
Whole lot better than kicking in
doors and getting shot at.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.109
Well...

25:11.110 --> 25:14.579
II miss kicking in doors.

25:14.580 --> 25:16.381
Well, you always were
the alley cat.

25:16.382 --> 25:20.852
I was always the house cat.

25:20.853 --> 25:23.454
You still doing this?
You still eating them?

25:23.455 --> 25:25.022
Not much point in catching them

25:25.023 --> 25:25.991
if you're gonna
throw them back in.

25:25.992 --> 25:28.326
Yeah, but from this river?

25:28.327 --> 25:32.196
Our poisons are our pleasures.

25:32.197 --> 25:35.133
I was wondering if you'd
look into something for me.

25:35.134 --> 25:38.002
Car breakins.

25:38.003 --> 25:40.671
Around the time of
the Mercedes massacre.

25:40.672 --> 25:43.674
So, what, early '09, late '08?

25:43.675 --> 25:45.009
Yeah.

25:45.010 --> 25:47.745
The ones that mystified us,
you know, smashandgrab shit.

25:47.746 --> 25:53.885
No broken windows
or poppedout lock or just...

25:53.886 --> 25:58.055
no physical evidence
of forced entry at all.

25:58.056 --> 26:00.826
Looking back into
the Mercedes case?

26:03.162 --> 26:05.497
What if I was?

26:09.368 --> 26:12.904
Dedicate your life to this shit,

26:12.905 --> 26:16.774
protecting, serving,
speaking for the dead.

26:16.775 --> 26:20.845
You can't even
down a drink or two?

26:20.846 --> 26:22.714
What kind of fucking world
is that?

26:28.187 --> 26:30.656
Do it to you,
they can do it to us.

26:33.725 --> 26:36.260
See what I can find out.

26:36.261 --> 26:39.665
Thanks for your time, Marlo.
Appreciate it.

26:45.204 --> 26:48.272
Still don't see the point.

26:48.273 --> 26:51.476
We're observing an anniversary.

26:51.477 --> 26:53.678
They don't know that.

26:53.679 --> 26:55.414
Maybe they do.

26:56.482 --> 26:58.484
Nah.

27:00.953 --> 27:03.622
Your father always loved me
in this dress.

27:09.294 --> 27:12.363
Same weather the day he died.

27:12.364 --> 27:15.366
What time is it?

27:15.367 --> 27:17.835
4:00.

27:17.836 --> 27:19.770
Close to the same time.

27:19.771 --> 27:24.308
They came to the house
at 3:30, said,

27:24.309 --> 27:28.713
"Something's happened to
your husband, Mrs. Hartsfield."

27:28.714 --> 27:30.982
You know, they say that
that much electricity

27:30.983 --> 27:33.585
hitting your body all at once
is pleasurable.

27:35.254 --> 27:37.923
Who'd be left alive to say?

27:40.325 --> 27:45.329
I think God gave your father
all his light at once,

27:45.330 --> 27:48.466
and he died in the glory
of that light.

27:48.467 --> 27:52.671
And what was the Almighty's plan
for Gerald?

28:01.547 --> 28:02.680
Mom!

28:02.681 --> 28:04.882
Gerald! Call 91!

28:04.883 --> 28:06.485
Call 91!

28:08.887 --> 28:11.889
He was so special.

28:11.890 --> 28:15.826
God just had to take him early.

28:15.827 --> 28:17.563
So why'd he send him back?

28:53.198 --> 28:55.667
He always stopped at one.

28:58.337 --> 29:00.605
It's so becoming.

29:00.606 --> 29:02.540
She does a wonderful job.

29:02.541 --> 29:05.010
Don't say it too loudly.
I'd have to give her a raise.

29:06.044 --> 29:07.278
She's worth it.

29:07.279 --> 29:09.347
And what are you doing
with the rest of your day?

29:09.348 --> 29:13.150
I am gonna treat myself to
a martini across the street.

29:13.151 --> 29:14.952
You rock out, girl.

29:14.953 --> 29:16.555
I might even have two.

29:18.624 --> 29:19.624
See you next month.

29:19.625 --> 29:20.625
Bye, Ida.

30:14.479 --> 30:17.815
Know why your dad took a job
at the power company?

30:17.816 --> 30:19.083
Steady work.

30:19.084 --> 30:21.218
Nope. It was a utility.

30:21.219 --> 30:24.422
Utilities, he used to say,
are recessionproof.

30:24.423 --> 30:26.624
Everybody needs water,

30:26.625 --> 30:28.893
everyone needs electricity
and gas.

30:28.894 --> 30:31.295
Until they privatize it all.

30:31.296 --> 30:33.898
We didn't want much.

30:33.899 --> 30:36.901
Solid house
and a solid neighborhood.

30:36.902 --> 30:38.369
Dad would get promoted
off the pole,

30:38.370 --> 30:41.305
become a supervisor,
that sort of thing.

30:41.306 --> 30:44.108
Take a vacation once a year,

30:44.109 --> 30:48.512
go to Paris on
our 10th anniversary.

30:48.513 --> 30:50.515
We were short a year.

30:53.318 --> 30:57.188
We just want what
our parents had, you know?

30:57.189 --> 31:00.791
Good job,
gold watch at the end of it,

31:00.792 --> 31:01.992
decent pension.

31:01.993 --> 31:03.594
Keep hearing about that world.

31:03.595 --> 31:05.996
Never seen it.

31:05.997 --> 31:08.200
They were rolling it up
before I was born.

31:10.535 --> 31:16.540
They can just snatch
this signal out of the air?

31:16.541 --> 31:17.541
Easypeasy.

31:20.812 --> 31:24.281
He definitely hacked my TV.

31:24.282 --> 31:27.017
What?

31:27.018 --> 31:28.819
One second I'm watching sports,

31:28.820 --> 31:31.622
the next, carnage.

31:31.623 --> 31:34.158
Second time he's done it.

31:34.159 --> 31:38.162
What did you see?

31:38.163 --> 31:40.564
The inside of
your sister's Mercedes,

31:40.565 --> 31:42.100
in the moment.

31:46.838 --> 31:47.439
No.

31:47.440 --> 31:48.907
'Fraid so.

31:53.512 --> 31:54.379
Did you record it?

31:54.380 --> 31:55.913
No.

31:55.914 --> 31:58.916
It was two seconds, maybe less.

31:58.917 --> 32:02.253
Well, what's your next move?

32:02.254 --> 32:05.189
My next move?

32:05.190 --> 32:08.259
Isn't that what people say when
they're on an investigation,

32:08.260 --> 32:09.528
"What's your next move"?

32:11.463 --> 32:13.597
Some may.
I'm not sure I ever have.

32:13.598 --> 32:14.598
Just go with it.

32:16.868 --> 32:18.569
My next move.

32:18.570 --> 32:22.006
Well, my next move is just
to continue to tune him up...

32:22.007 --> 32:24.275
Get him a tad perturbed.

32:24.276 --> 32:26.877
Yeah. Taunting him,

32:26.878 --> 32:30.147
calling him out as a fake,
et cetera, et cetera.

32:30.148 --> 32:31.549
Pissing him off.

32:31.550 --> 32:33.084
Any luck, very much so.

32:35.754 --> 32:38.289
Is it really wise,
pissing off a lunatic?

32:38.290 --> 32:42.026
People make mistakes
when they're angry.

32:42.027 --> 32:44.095
People make corpses
when they're angry, too.

32:50.769 --> 32:52.904
I brought you something.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.990
Now you look like
a real gumshoe.

33:13.658 --> 33:14.726
Thank you.

33:18.129 --> 33:19.598
I like it.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.934
You know what
I'm thinking about?

33:23.935 --> 33:24.870
No.

33:24.871 --> 33:27.873
My next move.

33:56.501 --> 34:00.772
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

34:05.510 --> 34:07.646
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

34:12.851 --> 34:16.120
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

34:16.121 --> 34:20.125
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

34:23.594 --> 34:27.599
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

35:08.773 --> 35:12.443
Outside there's

35:15.714 --> 35:19.783
Out by the fire breathing.

35:19.784 --> 35:23.120
Outside we wait
till face turns blue

35:23.121 --> 35:26.390
I know the nervous walking

35:26.391 --> 35:30.594
I know the dirty beard hangs.

35:30.595 --> 35:34.531
Out by the box car waiting.

35:34.532 --> 35:37.334
Take me away to nowhere plains.

35:37.335 --> 35:39.470
There is a wait so long.

35:39.471 --> 35:41.872
So long, so long.

35:41.873 --> 35:45.676
You'll never wait so long.

35:45.677 --> 35:47.545
Here comes your man.

35:49.948 --> 35:51.483
Here comes your man.

35:53.351 --> 35:55.153
Here comes your man.

36:02.027 --> 36:05.496
Sorry about that, Dixie.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.498
Big shake to the land.

36:07.499 --> 36:09.433
Next person, please.

36:09.434 --> 36:12.370
Is a wind makes.

36:13.571 --> 36:15.506
You're next, sir.

36:15.507 --> 36:16.640
YYou can go.

36:16.641 --> 36:18.709
No. After you.

36:18.710 --> 36:20.244
Well...

36:20.245 --> 36:23.014
I think I grabbed
the wrong screws anyway.

36:27.519 --> 36:29.254
Next customer, please.

36:37.262 --> 36:38.796
Hey. Mr. Mundy.

36:38.797 --> 36:41.598
Brady Hartsfield. How are you?

36:41.599 --> 36:42.400
Excellent, sir. You?

36:42.401 --> 36:44.935
Yeah, you know.

36:44.936 --> 36:47.805
Supplementing the income.

36:47.806 --> 36:49.039
You know,
high school science teachers

36:49.040 --> 36:50.160
don't live the glamour life.

36:52.744 --> 36:54.611
So what are you
up to these days?

36:54.612 --> 36:56.480
I work in I.T.

36:56.481 --> 36:59.016
Fixing computers, mostly.

36:59.017 --> 36:59.784
Well, good for you.

36:59.785 --> 37:01.085
You were always a wiz at that.

37:01.086 --> 37:03.153
Yeah.

37:03.154 --> 37:04.621
Getting into gardening?

37:04.622 --> 37:07.357
A little.

37:07.358 --> 37:10.294
That was a tiny yard you had,
wasn't it?

37:10.295 --> 37:11.762
Yeah, but my mom,

37:11.763 --> 37:14.364
she's, kind of got
a little victory garden going.

37:14.365 --> 37:17.367
How is Deborah doing these days?

37:17.368 --> 37:18.902
Quite well, thanks for asking.

37:18.903 --> 37:23.575
Um, she's gardening, so...
that's good.

37:25.977 --> 37:26.244
That's terrific to hear.

37:26.245 --> 37:27.978
Yeah.

37:27.979 --> 37:31.181
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
She's she's doing great.

37:31.182 --> 37:32.449
Well...

37:32.450 --> 37:33.851
Well...

37:33.852 --> 37:35.919
$59.40.

37:35.920 --> 37:38.388
All righty.

37:38.389 --> 37:40.991
Ch ch ch.

37:40.992 --> 37:42.659
There we are.

37:42.660 --> 37:44.662
All right.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.404
Dadada. There you go.

37:54.405 --> 37:56.607
Thank you. Here's your receipt.
60 cents.

37:56.608 --> 37:57.542
Thank you very much.
Have a good day.

37:57.543 --> 37:59.143
You too. Nice to see you, sir.

37:59.144 --> 38:01.044
Nice to see you, too.
Tell your mom I said hey.

38:01.045 --> 38:01.746
I will.

38:01.747 --> 38:04.015
Next customer, please.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.558
You do recon before
you walk into a place

38:14.559 --> 38:15.826
to buy fucking poison.

38:15.827 --> 38:17.361
You make sure the cashier

38:17.362 --> 38:18.362
is not your old faggot
science teacher,

38:18.363 --> 38:20.365
you dumb fucking fuck!

38:23.501 --> 38:27.104
Fuck! Fuck!

38:27.105 --> 38:28.773
Fuck!

38:35.313 --> 38:38.315
How did it end?

38:38.316 --> 38:40.784
The way most things end.

38:40.785 --> 38:42.186
Unpleasantly.

38:42.187 --> 38:44.855
Are you still
in contact with her?

38:44.856 --> 38:48.659
Occasional Christmas card.
That's it.

38:48.660 --> 38:51.795
My daughter more so,
but... you know what I mean.

38:51.796 --> 38:52.430
You got kids?

38:52.431 --> 38:55.599
Nah, just fuckhead.

38:55.600 --> 38:58.602
I mean my dear exhusband.

38:58.603 --> 39:01.872
I see.

39:01.873 --> 39:02.807
Yeah.

39:02.808 --> 39:05.209
A real love affair
with my daughter.

39:05.210 --> 39:06.543
When she was a kid,
I could just...

39:06.544 --> 39:09.746
How could you not, you know?

39:09.747 --> 39:11.548
Yeah, I mean,
they make you feel like a god

39:11.549 --> 39:12.683
and it's nice
to feel like a god,

39:12.684 --> 39:15.285
but that just means
that even if you're

39:15.286 --> 39:19.156
a great father,
you're bound to disenchant them

39:19.157 --> 39:22.559
when they realize you're just
a mess of a man like any other,

39:22.560 --> 39:24.294
and I wasn't a great father.

39:24.295 --> 39:27.965
Wasn't even
a particularly good one.

39:27.966 --> 39:28.998
Yeah.

39:28.999 --> 39:31.435
I broke her heart, really,

39:31.436 --> 39:34.838
and then she spent the next
10 years breaking mine.

39:34.839 --> 39:37.641
Drugs, booze,

39:37.642 --> 39:40.043
boyfriends who only offered STDs

39:40.044 --> 39:44.915
and new ways to separate her
from what little money she had.

39:44.916 --> 39:47.384
Yeah, she's in rehab now,

39:47.385 --> 39:49.319
not far from here,

39:49.320 --> 39:51.655
yet again.

39:51.656 --> 39:54.124
When do you see her?

39:54.125 --> 39:57.928
I don't.

39:57.929 --> 40:01.199
The fuck is wrong with you?

40:02.800 --> 40:04.201
You have to.

40:04.202 --> 40:06.336
She made it abundantly clear...

40:06.337 --> 40:07.804
Yeah. That she doesn't want...

40:07.805 --> 40:09.539
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

40:09.540 --> 40:13.944
You don't get off that easy.

40:13.945 --> 40:15.879
You're still her god.

40:15.880 --> 40:19.082
You're just her god who fell.

40:19.083 --> 40:20.384
You get back up there.

40:20.385 --> 40:23.821
You get your ass up there
and see her.

40:26.357 --> 40:28.625
All due respect,

40:28.626 --> 40:30.093
you don't have kids.

40:30.094 --> 40:33.831
All due respect,
I've been a daughter, dick.

40:35.833 --> 40:38.035
When you say "dick,"

40:38.036 --> 40:40.570
you mean dick as in gumshoe,

40:40.571 --> 40:43.907
private dick,
that kind of thing?

40:43.908 --> 40:45.576
I mean dick as in dick.

40:48.112 --> 40:49.714
Thought that's what you meant.

40:54.852 --> 40:57.321
Seems okay.

40:57.322 --> 40:58.822
But it did last time, too.

40:58.823 --> 41:01.258
Well, the entire motherboard
was replaced this time,

41:01.259 --> 41:02.526
Mr. Springhill. You're all set.

41:02.527 --> 41:04.728
That's what I was told
last time.

41:04.729 --> 41:09.333
We did not replace the entire
motherboard last time, sir.

41:09.334 --> 41:12.003
Where do you keep her leash?

41:13.338 --> 41:16.273
What?

41:16.274 --> 41:18.076
Better work.

41:27.418 --> 41:29.420
All right. Let's close up.

42:02.653 --> 42:06.990
Who signs your checks
these days?

42:06.991 --> 42:09.994
That would be you, I think.

42:13.464 --> 42:15.199
That makes me...

42:16.467 --> 42:18.202
Your boss.

42:20.605 --> 42:21.605
Well, I guess it does.

42:25.343 --> 42:28.813
That makes this inappropriate.

42:53.304 --> 42:54.504
Maybe we should hold off.

42:54.505 --> 42:56.039
What? What... why?

42:56.040 --> 42:56.707
We've had a lot to drink.

42:56.708 --> 42:58.175
I don't know, I don't know.

42:58.176 --> 43:02.312
I don't know.

43:02.313 --> 43:03.314
Maybe not.

43:07.185 --> 43:08.986
Maybe, maybe.

43:15.526 --> 43:17.395
I've got to hit the head first.

43:22.266 --> 43:23.334
Sorry.

43:29.006 --> 43:30.942
Where, um...

43:55.032 --> 43:56.900
Come on.

43:56.901 --> 44:00.504
Take you to a warm, happy place.

44:00.505 --> 44:02.305
You love this place.

44:02.306 --> 44:06.643
It's your favorite place,
always has been.

44:06.644 --> 44:09.980
Come on, come on,
you motherfucker.

44:09.981 --> 44:10.515
Are you okay in there?
Grand, yeah!

44:10.516 --> 44:13.117
I'll be out in a sec!

44:19.390 --> 44:20.390
Good man, yourself.

44:24.128 --> 44:27.464
Okay, good man.

44:27.465 --> 44:28.999
Yeah.

44:38.943 --> 44:40.043
Maybe you're right.

44:40.044 --> 44:41.144
Maybe,

44:41.145 --> 44:43.614
we've had too much to drink.

44:46.150 --> 44:47.351
Okay.

44:51.689 --> 44:53.558
Okay.

44:56.694 --> 44:58.562
It's okay.

44:58.563 --> 45:01.899
We'll commend ourselves for
our mature restraint in the a.m.

45:04.101 --> 45:06.169
See you tomorrow.

45:06.170 --> 45:07.638
Good night.

45:37.034 --> 45:40.804
Where do you lay your head
at night, Ryan Springhill?

45:40.805 --> 45:42.272
I'm guessing you're
a splitlevel ranch

45:42.273 --> 45:43.941
kind of gent.

45:46.077 --> 45:50.681
I bet your bros all call you
"dude" or "Ry Guy."

45:53.050 --> 45:54.084
But then, what would I know?

45:54.085 --> 45:57.887
I'm just a dickless wonder,
right, Ry Guy?

45:57.888 --> 46:02.425
And you're the big man.

46:02.426 --> 46:04.361
Cheerleaders loved you
at school,

46:04.362 --> 46:07.631
girls love you at the gym,

46:07.632 --> 46:10.700
and all your bros
think you're such a tough guy.

46:10.701 --> 46:13.637
Yeah, you're just a big man.

46:13.638 --> 46:17.375
You're just a big bro, bro.
You're a big bro, bro.

46:25.516 --> 46:27.118
Happy birthday.

46:31.188 --> 46:33.123
Dang, Ry.

46:33.124 --> 46:36.861
You are so fucking cool.

46:54.478 --> 46:55.946
You're flawless.

47:01.285 --> 47:03.287
Now I know you're drunk.

47:09.160 --> 47:10.994
You got this, Ry.

47:10.995 --> 47:11.729
Ry, you got this.

47:11.730 --> 47:13.497
You can make it. Then again...

47:40.658 --> 47:43.460
You thought you had that one,
didn't you, Ry?

47:43.461 --> 47:46.730
Well...

47:46.731 --> 47:48.132
life's a curveball, bitch.

47:52.136 --> 47:56.272
Now you're all,
"Who's that in my rearview?

47:56.273 --> 47:58.542
I didn't see lights before."

48:01.479 --> 48:02.479
No, you didn't.

48:04.882 --> 48:06.283
No, you didn't.

48:28.639 --> 48:30.174
Merry Christmas, Ry.

48:55.466 --> 48:57.867
Ha! Ha ha!

48:57.868 --> 49:00.003
Holy fuck!

49:00.004 --> 49:01.338
Holy fuck!

49:45.316 --> 49:49.786
What?

49:49.787 --> 49:51.388
I can't hear you.

50:02.399 --> 50:05.870
I've seen that look before.

51:27.284 --> 51:30.286
He was a badass demon.

51:30.287 --> 51:33.823
New Orleans.

51:33.824 --> 51:35.959
Badass demon.

51:35.960 --> 51:39.696
And that mother was mean.

51:39.697 --> 51:42.632
His girlfriend was good in bed.

51:42.633 --> 51:47.637
But you know that girlfriend
didn't even have no head.

51:47.638 --> 51:53.710
He was a badass demon
on the run from the law.

51:53.711 --> 51:59.182
We brought his ass back to
life with a monkey paw.

51:59.183 --> 52:02.185
We got two wishes left.

52:02.186 --> 52:04.654
One is for drugs.

52:04.655 --> 52:08.324
And the other for sex.

52:08.325 --> 52:09.926
Well, he can writhe on the floor.

52:09.927 --> 52:11.728
He can writhe on the ceiling.

52:11.729 --> 52:12.596
He can writhe anywhere.

52:12.597 --> 52:14.530
He was a rock 'n' roll demon.

52:14.531 --> 52:16.199
He was a badass demon.

52:16.200 --> 52:20.470
Smoking lead.

52:20.471 --> 52:22.672
Mama, machete.

52:22.673 --> 52:26.009
Better watch your head.

52:26.010 --> 52:28.811
We don't care what he does.

52:28.812 --> 52:30.480
As long as the demon.

52:30.481 --> 52:34.884
Brings the badassest of drugs.

52:34.885 --> 52:36.486
He can writhe on the ceiling.

52:36.487 --> 52:37.487
He can writhe anywhere.

52:37.488 --> 52:39.555
He was a rock 'n' roll demon.

52:39.556 --> 52:41.157
He was a badass demon.

52:41.158 --> 52:45.161
Smoking lead.

52:45.162 --> 52:47.764
Mama Machete.

52:47.765 --> 52:50.767
Better watch your head.

52:50.768 --> 52:53.770
We don't care what he does.

52:53.771 --> 52:59.976
As long as the demon
brings the badassest of drugs.

52:59.977 --> 53:01.177
We can writhe on the floor.

53:01.178 --> 53:02.979
We can writhe on the ceiling.

53:02.980 --> 53:04.113
We can writhe anywhere.

53:04.114 --> 53:06.049
We are the fucking Green Demons.

53:06.050 --> 53:07.651
Guitar!

53:15.125 --> 53:17.860
Get it on, little demon, come on.

53:17.861 --> 53:20.663
There you go, little demon.

53:20.664 --> 53:23.133
All night long
