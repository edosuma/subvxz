the unions at all costs.

16:26.128 --> 16:28.248
Are you unhappy, Soren?
What gave me away, sir?

16:28.408 --> 16:31.168
I don't know.
Your expression never changes.

Do you even know how to smile?
Yes.

Good heavens.

I thought you had to be
convicted of a crime

somewhere like this.

the rest of it yet.

17:27.568 --> 17:29.688

17:33.648 --> 17:35.048
Well, I like it.

17:35.208 --> 17:37.368
And I'll even let you
have first choice of the beds.

You see, here, we're just
two typical college students.

Absolutely, sir.

I'm not a waitress, there are no menus,
and the kitchen's closed.

19:15.928 --> 19:18.368
Well, then what can you offer us?

19:19.968 --> 19:22.888

Hello again.
What can I get for you?

20:13.888 --> 20:15.408
I was hoping you could
recommend something better

20:15.568 --> 20:16.968
than what we've been drinking.

20:17.128 --> 20:19.728
Well, for the discerning
out-of-towner like yourself,

20:19.888 --> 20:21.648
I recommend Leinenkugel's.

the extra 10 cents.

20:24.728 --> 20:26.528
Yes, by all means. Two, please.

right now, we'd be underground.

you will be conducting.

Now, I want you to turn to
the person next to you

23:04.528 --> 23:05.888

Eddie. Right.

23:27.328 --> 23:28.768
This class is really important to me

23:28.928 --> 23:31.048
because I need this teacher
to get me into med school.

23:31.208 --> 23:33.048
And if I'm stuck with you
as my lab partner,

23:33.208 --> 23:35.488
I can't afford to have you
screw things up for me, OK?

23:35.648 --> 23:39.288
It's very important to me as well.
I love organic chemistry.

23:39.448 --> 23:42.008
For instance,
I've just recently discovered

23:42.168 --> 23:44.688
that large amounts of alcohol
mixed with a carbon-based life form

23:44.848 --> 23:47.368
causes the life form
to blurt out stupid things.

23:47.528 --> 23:51.168
So, well, apologies for the other night.
I was just having some fun.

23:51.328 --> 23:53.168
Right, of course you were.

23:53.328 --> 23:56.328
And I love being made to feel like
a brainless slut by some sloppy lush.

23:56.488 --> 23:57.608
Thanks.

23:57.768 --> 24:01.608
I have learned me to repent
the sin of disobedient opposition

To you and your behest,
I am enjoined and beg your pardon.

Don't forget your half
of the supplies next time.

24:31.928 --> 24:34.928
You would think that after spraying
somebody with high-powered soda,

24:35.088 --> 24:36.688
he'd get the message to stay away.

24:36.848 --> 24:40.648
Well, I think he's pretty hot.

24:40.808 --> 24:42.808
Hot? Oh, my God, Beth,
he is so affected.

24:42.968 --> 24:48.088
He was quoting Shakespeare, like
some Shakespearean-duke-lord guy.

24:48.248 --> 24:49.888
I hate phonies like that.

24:50.048 --> 24:52.928

take him up to the stacks?

24:53.088 --> 24:56.528
OK, A â€• going at it
in the dusty stacks of the library

24:56.688 --> 24:58.088

And B â€• you literally say that
about every hot guy.

25:00.928 --> 25:02.968
Oh, so you admit he's hot.

25:03.128 --> 25:04.728
OK, I'm done having
this conversation.

25:04.888 --> 25:06.768
I need to concentrate
on my applications.

into the separatory funnel.

Good morning, miss.

26:04.208 --> 26:05.568
Would you care for some breakfast?

26:05.728 --> 26:08.168
I spent the last two hours
looking like an incompetent idiot

26:08.328 --> 26:09.888
because my lab partner
didn't show up.

26:10.048 --> 26:11.768
Oh. Was that this morning?
Yes!

26:11.928 --> 26:13.848
You know, I know
exactly who you are.

26:14.008 --> 26:14.928
You do?
You do?

You're just a spoiled
little rich kid

who sees college as a detour
on the way to an easy life.

26:19.368 --> 26:21.968
No character. No accomplishments.
Just a royal pain in the ass.

26:22.128 --> 26:24.048
You're completely wrong.

26:24.208 --> 26:26.848
See, unlike people
who are given everything,

26:27.008 --> 26:28.728
I have to earn what I get.

26:28.888 --> 26:30.368
But that is the beauty
of a meritocracy â€•

26:30.528 --> 26:32.488
people rise and fall
based on how hard they work.

26:32.648 --> 26:34.088

hollandaise, Eddie?

26:34.248 --> 26:35.568
No, that's very good. Thank you.

some sort of statue of themselves
somewhere.

26:52.288 --> 26:54.328
There's a difference between
being righteous and being right.

26:54.488 --> 26:57.208
I happen to be right. Could you
please put a shirt on or something?

26:57.368 --> 27:00.248

you'll have to get used to naked men.

in our room!

27:03.888 --> 27:05.688
Just drop the class.
No.

27:05.848 --> 27:08.568

and you'd better be prepared.

I don't see why you would care.

to make my life miserable?

Alright, it seems we're completely
out of turkey today.

10 turkey things in there.

28:46.448 --> 28:48.328
Is this some sort of test?

28:48.488 --> 28:50.808
Did Johns Hopkins send you
to see if I can handle pressure?

28:50.968 --> 28:52.288
Because I'm starting to crack.

28:52.448 --> 28:54.928
Well, who's in charge of carving?
Use the slicer.

28:55.088 --> 28:56.288
What's that?

29:00.448 --> 29:02.088
You used me as a reference.

29:02.248 --> 29:04.048
Yes. Look, you were
the only one I knew.

29:04.208 --> 29:06.928
Despite what you think, I really do
need this job. I have no money.

Look, Paige, you were right
about my parents back in Denmark.

29:23.248 --> 29:24.608
They are from a certain wealth.

29:24.768 --> 29:26.848
But what I've done
is I've cut myself off from them.

29:27.008 --> 29:29.408
Dude.
Yes, just one minute.

advantage of you recently, and...

29:36.768 --> 29:38.248
But just give me a chance today,

and if I cause any problems,
then I'll quit.

29:43.168 --> 29:46.048
OK. Your right hand
goes on the handle.

back and forth.

29:50.248 --> 29:52.128
And unless you want
a turkey-thumb sandwich,

29:52.288 --> 29:54.648
don't put your hand anywhere near
the blade when it's moving, OK?

29:54.808 --> 29:55.688
Right.

29:55.848 --> 29:57.448
OK.

30:06.248 --> 30:07.848
Slowly, slowly.
Right.

30:08.008 --> 30:09.448
Right.

30:09.608 --> 30:11.408
OK, nice and smooth.

30:20.808 --> 30:22.528
Um, that's enough.

30:33.048 --> 30:36.208
Here, Paige, it's your turn tonight.
OK.

WITH YOU' BY MARC COHN PLAYS)

I don't fall in love with you

31:06.768 --> 31:10.808
â™ª Falling in love just makes me blue

31:13.928 --> 31:19.648
â™ª Well, the music plays
and you display your heart for me to see

31:19.808 --> 31:25.168
â™ª I had a beer and now I hear you
calling out for me

31:26.208 --> 31:30.408
â™ª And I hope that I don't
fall in love with you

31:35.088 --> 31:39.648

Are you sure you don't
want me to give you a hand, sir?

32:10.088 --> 32:11.888
No, I'm fine.
Goodnight.

32:16.128 --> 32:17.128
Hey.

32:19.408 --> 32:21.248
You did OK in there.
(LAUGHS)

32:21.408 --> 32:23.048
You can't be serious, can you?

32:23.208 --> 32:25.728
Well, by 'OK', I mean
spilling a ton of beer

32:25.888 --> 32:27.208
and screwing up everyone's order.

32:27.368 --> 32:29.208
(LAUGHS)

32:29.368 --> 32:31.448
Yeah.
No, you'll be fine.

32:36.768 --> 32:41.688
Um, you know, this Saturday evening,
there's a dorm party at Brenner Hall.

32:41.848 --> 32:43.568
A gathering.

32:45.048 --> 32:47.688
I was wondering...wondering
if you would like to accompany me.

32:47.848 --> 32:49.928
(LAUGHS) Accompany you?

32:50.088 --> 32:51.768
Oh, right, yes.
How do you say it colloquially?

32:51.928 --> 32:52.848
Um...

32:53.008 --> 32:56.248
Yo, dog, there's a mad party
kicking at my crib,

32:56.408 --> 32:58.728
if you want to...
roll down there with me.

32:59.728 --> 33:00.568
Ow.

33:00.728 --> 33:03.608
That was just sad.
Don't ever do that again.

33:03.768 --> 33:05.448
Yes, I really hurt my finger.

33:06.448 --> 33:08.008
So would you like to come?

33:12.768 --> 33:15.688
I...I'm actually kind of busy.

33:19.408 --> 33:20.928
Oh, dear.

33:23.488 --> 33:24.528
What?

33:24.688 --> 33:27.008
I believe you just
got rejected, sir.

33:29.328 --> 33:31.568
You know, I don't think
that's ever happened to me before.

33:31.728 --> 33:33.328
You've never been attracted
to anyone

33:33.488 --> 33:35.248
who didn't know
you were a prince before.

33:35.408 --> 33:37.968
I wouldn't get too worked up
over it, sir.

33:38.128 --> 33:41.208
The chances of a relationship
between yourself and Miss Paige

33:41.368 --> 33:42.768
are not promising.

33:42.928 --> 33:45.408
You two are of
a completely different calibre.

33:45.568 --> 33:49.288
Soren, just because she isn't royalty
doesn't mean she's not important.

33:49.448 --> 33:53.608
The higher calibre
I was referring to, sir, was hers.

33:54.888 --> 33:56.208
What?

33:56.368 --> 33:59.288

more to it than this.

But there will be
more of these tests, yes?

34:17.648 --> 34:19.048
I can't say for sure.

34:19.208 --> 34:21.048
There will be several of these tests?
There might be.

34:21.208 --> 34:22.528
Will this take many days?

34:22.688 --> 34:25.168
No, I'm pretty sure that
we can get them out of the way.

34:26.448 --> 34:28.288
I don't think you need
to go to this.

(LAUGHS) I promised I'd go.

34:30.248 --> 34:31.808
Are you feeling ill, Daddy?

34:35.368 --> 34:37.768
There's nothing to worry about,
my darling.

34:38.808 --> 34:42.888
Yes, Arabella, you shouldn't worry.

34:43.048 --> 34:44.688
Just a little flu.

34:44.848 --> 34:48.248
Excuse me, ma'am. It's time for
His Majesty to be going.

34:48.408 --> 34:49.888
Sweetie.

34:51.688 --> 34:53.448

Mr Williams, please do something.

35:33.888 --> 35:36.928
So, you know the other day
when you quoted 'Romeo and Juliet'?

35:37.088 --> 35:38.728
Yes.

35:38.888 --> 35:40.208
Well, it's funny because

35:40.368 --> 35:42.808
I'm actually taking
a Shakespeare class myself and...

35:44.008 --> 35:46.568
I'm not struggling.
I'm actually being graded unfairly.

35:46.728 --> 35:48.928
But I was wondering,
since you seem to be...

35:49.088 --> 35:50.448
Well versed.

35:51.448 --> 35:52.288
Yeah.

35:52.448 --> 35:54.248
Well, I was hoping
maybe you could...

35:54.408 --> 35:55.368
Help you.

35:55.528 --> 35:57.888
No, I don't need help.
Oh, OK.

35:58.048 --> 36:00.728
Just sounded like you were
asking me for help, that's all.

36:00.888 --> 36:02.448
Forget it.

36:06.088 --> 36:07.888
Yeah, OK, I need help.

36:08.048 --> 36:10.768
Yes, I'll help you.
It's not a problem.

36:11.968 --> 36:13.648
Only, I'm...

36:14.688 --> 36:17.008

done laundry before, can you?

36:26.208 --> 36:28.088
Yeah, it's a real leap.

do you know what goes in which pile?

say I'm the Rain Man of laundry.

We did 'King Lear',
and now we're on the sonnets.

37:03.248 --> 37:07.008
Next, it's 'Hamlet', which is about
a whiny prince from Denmark.

37:07.168 --> 37:08.648
What does that have to do
with reality?

37:08.808 --> 37:10.208
More than you think.

37:10.368 --> 37:12.208
Well, you're from Denmark.
Do you even have princes?

37:12.368 --> 37:13.968
Yes, I think we do.

37:14.128 --> 37:16.208
Well, Beth read it,
and she said he's a total loser.

37:16.368 --> 37:19.208
Well, you can tell Beth that
the prince was young and scared

37:19.368 --> 37:21.888
and he didn't feel ready for
the hard choices he had to make.

37:22.048 --> 37:24.168
It's not easy facing
that kind of pressure.

37:28.848 --> 37:31.128
Right. Sonnets, you say.

37:39.968 --> 37:41.728
"O, me!

37:41.888 --> 37:44.048
"What eyes hath love put in my head

37:45.408 --> 37:47.888
"Which have no correspondence
With true sight

37:49.928 --> 37:52.328
"Or if they have
Where is my judgment fled

37:52.488 --> 37:54.608
"That censures falsely
What they see aright?"

37:56.248 --> 37:57.568
It's beautiful.

37:57.728 --> 37:59.568
It's gibberish.
I have no idea what he's saying.

37:59.728 --> 38:03.448
Well, he's saying
that love is magical

38:03.608 --> 38:05.848
and that it makes people
look at each other

38:06.008 --> 38:07.448
in an unspoilt way,
without judgment.

38:07.608 --> 38:08.968
Why doesn't he just say that?

38:09.128 --> 38:10.728
Why can't people just
say what they mean?

38:11.728 --> 38:13.568
Well, people rarely say
what they mean.

38:14.568 --> 38:16.688
That's the interesting part, is...

38:16.848 --> 38:19.568
...is what's going on
underneath the surface.

38:21.328 --> 38:23.128
See, take line 12.

38:24.568 --> 38:27.208
"The sun itself sees not
Till heaven clears."

38:27.368 --> 38:28.888
What does that mean to you?

38:30.248 --> 38:33.088
That the sun can't shine
when it's cloudy.

38:33.248 --> 38:35.648
No. You're being too literal.
See, don't just go for the obvious.

38:35.808 --> 38:38.368
See, all these words,
they have multiple meanings

38:38.528 --> 38:41.688
and you have to
explore the possibilities

38:41.848 --> 38:43.408
and then make your choice.

38:44.408 --> 38:47.168
See, like the word 'sun',
that could mean the actual sun

38:47.328 --> 38:49.688
or it can mean light.

38:49.848 --> 38:52.488
But then 'light' can mean
knowledge or reason.

38:52.648 --> 38:56.008
That could go on forever.
(LAUGHS) Yes. Yes, it could.

38:56.168 --> 38:58.528
But I think in this case
it means reason.

38:58.688 --> 39:02.968
And then 'heaven' may refer
to the pearly gates

39:03.128 --> 39:04.928
or it could mean a state of being,

39:05.088 --> 39:08.128
you know, like being happy
or in love.

39:11.888 --> 39:14.688
So now read it again,
taking in all the possibilities,

39:14.848 --> 39:17.848
and tell me what you think it means.

39:20.488 --> 39:23.808
"The sun itself sees not
Till heaven clears".

39:29.248 --> 39:32.928
I guess...it means
that love blinds you

39:33.088 --> 39:36.688
and when you're in love,
you can't think reasonably.

39:39.488 --> 39:41.088
Do you agree?

39:42.088 --> 39:43.568
Yeah.

39:47.808 --> 39:49.568

40:02.248 --> 40:04.208
being part of the EU

for Thanksgiving?

41:19.328 --> 41:21.728
No, no. I'll be here.

41:24.968 --> 41:28.488
Um...have a good vacation.
Yes, you too.

41:29.968 --> 41:32.368
I can't believe you.
I can't believe you, Paige.

41:32.528 --> 41:34.328
You should've invited him
home with you.

41:34.488 --> 41:37.088
What? No. That would be so weird.

41:37.248 --> 41:39.728
Well, then you won't mind

41:39.888 --> 41:42.128
if I invite him
back to Milwaukee with me?

41:42.288 --> 41:45.328
No. No, of course not.
Why would I mind?

41:45.488 --> 41:47.208
I don't know.

Hey, Eddie, since you don't
have any other plans,

41:51.608 --> 41:52.928
I was wondering if...

41:53.088 --> 41:56.368
You wanted to spend Thanksgiving
with me and my family?

41:57.928 --> 42:00.768

should come with you, sir.

that's not for you to decide.

43:07.048 --> 43:08.728
The only college friends of Paige's
we've ever met,

43:08.888 --> 43:10.008
they've all been girls.

43:10.168 --> 43:11.608
Thank you. I was glad to be invited.

43:11.768 --> 43:13.528
Hi, Eddie. I'm Ben Morgan.
Ben, hello.

43:13.688 --> 43:17.688
Hey, hey, Doc Paige.
(LAUGHS) Farmer John Sausage.

43:17.848 --> 43:19.328
Ooh!
(LAUGHS)

43:19.488 --> 43:22.128
Hey.
Hey. Oh, Mike, you look great.

43:22.288 --> 43:25.408
Oh, well, you know, Kayla's got me
on Slim Fast, so I lost 15.

43:25.568 --> 43:27.768
He put five of it back on today
at Rocky Rococo's.

43:27.928 --> 43:28.928
Boys.

43:30.648 --> 43:33.368
Er, who's this guy?
This is Eddie.

43:33.528 --> 43:36.168
Eddie's an exchange student
from Denmark. He's just a friend.

43:36.328 --> 43:37.648
Hello.

43:37.808 --> 43:40.768
(LOUDLY) Welcome to our home.
Thank you.

43:40.928 --> 43:43.208
Mike, he speaks better English
than you do.

43:43.368 --> 43:46.168
Yeah, anyway...
Pops, we'll see you in the morning.

43:46.328 --> 43:48.888
Hey, we're watching you, Frenchy.

43:49.048 --> 43:51.168
Come on into the house.

43:52.168 --> 43:55.568
You can ignore the moron twins.
(LAUGHS) OK.

43:58.048 --> 43:59.808
This is it.

44:01.768 --> 44:04.168
Oh, you can put them right here.
Right.

44:04.328 --> 44:05.808
Thanks.

44:20.128 --> 44:21.968
(LAUGHS)

44:31.728 --> 44:33.368
What are all the pins for?

44:33.528 --> 44:35.528
The few red ones
are where I've been

44:35.688 --> 44:37.568
and all the green ones
are where I wanna go.

44:37.728 --> 44:40.568
Ecuador. El Salvador.

44:40.728 --> 44:44.008
(LAUGHS) They're not exactly
tourist destinations, are they?

44:44.168 --> 44:46.928
No, but they're all the places
that Doctors Without Borders

44:47.088 --> 44:49.448
brings good medical care
and vaccinations

44:49.608 --> 44:51.008
and clean drinking water.

44:51.168 --> 44:52.888
What?
Nothing.

44:53.048 --> 44:56.848
I just really never met someone
who makes me feel so intimidated.

44:57.008 --> 45:00.808
And believe me, I've met my fair share
of intimidating people.

45:00.968 --> 45:03.288
(LAUGHS) I'm not intimidating.
Look at me.

45:03.448 --> 45:06.408
Yes, well, you see,
that's pretty intimidating as well.

45:08.408 --> 45:11.128
Well, I'm not the only one with goals.
What do you wanna do?

45:11.288 --> 45:13.088
I don't really have any choice.

45:13.248 --> 45:16.448
I have to take over
the family business.

45:16.608 --> 45:19.768
No choice at all?
No.

45:19.928 --> 45:21.848
(SQUEAKS)
Careful, you're crushing Gus.

45:23.208 --> 45:24.528
Oh, Gus.

45:24.688 --> 45:27.168
Yes, Gus.
He's a very good watch-moose.

45:27.328 --> 45:29.528
Not once was I attacked
by a monster under my bed

45:29.688 --> 45:31.248
or something scary in the closet.

45:31.408 --> 45:32.768
Isn't that right, Gus?

45:32.928 --> 45:34.448
(DEEP VOICE) Yes, that's right.
(LAUGHS)

45:34.608 --> 45:36.288
Hello, Gus. Nice to meet you.

45:36.448 --> 45:38.368
Very pleased to meet you, as well.
(LAUGHS)

45:42.368 --> 45:43.688
I like you like this.

45:43.848 --> 45:45.928
Like what?

45:47.488 --> 45:49.008
I don't know. Just...just like this.

45:49.168 --> 45:50.808
Just Paige.

45:53.968 --> 45:56.808
Alright, Eddie, we got John's room
made up for you.

45:56.968 --> 45:58.968
It's just down the hall,
across from our room.

45:59.128 --> 46:02.768
We sleep with the door open.
Thanks, Dad.

46:02.928 --> 46:05.728
So, Eddie, would you like to see
how things work around here?

46:05.888 --> 46:07.328
Maybe help us out tomorrow?

46:07.488 --> 46:10.008
No, no, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

46:10.168 --> 46:12.768
Oh, why not?
Yes, why not?

46:14.408 --> 46:16.528
OK. You know what?
Go ahead and help out.

46:16.688 --> 46:18.128
I'm gonna enjoy this.

46:18.288 --> 46:20.448
Come on, let's get you settled in.

46:25.248 --> 46:28.088
Stop. Stop. Stop!

46:32.648 --> 46:33.488
Whoa!

46:33.648 --> 46:36.368
Whoa. Whoa! Whoa!

46:38.768 --> 46:41.568
Whoa. This one nearly hit me.

46:41.728 --> 46:44.728
(SPEAKS INAUDIBLY)

47:03.928 --> 47:06.528
Looks pretty funny.
Haven't seen too many tractors, huh?

47:07.768 --> 47:09.728
Nicely done with the milking.

47:09.888 --> 47:12.248
Yeah, I think you got
a new best friend in Bessie.

47:12.408 --> 47:14.848
Whoo!
Hey, should we get some dinner?

47:15.008 --> 47:18.088
What are those?
They're lawn mowers.

47:18.248 --> 47:21.448
Lawn mowers. Really?
Yeah.

47:22.448 --> 47:24.368
Uh-uh-uh. Hey, hey.

47:24.528 --> 47:28.688
Actually, we race these.
It's a huge sport around here.

47:28.848 --> 47:30.768
Really?
Yeah.

47:30.928 --> 47:32.488
Do you mind if I have a look?

47:32.648 --> 47:34.248
No, be our guest.

47:34.408 --> 47:36.768
Take a look at this one.
This is my baby.

47:36.928 --> 47:38.248
Right.

47:38.408 --> 47:41.168
(LAUGHS)

47:47.608 --> 47:50.968
I just put a new flywheel in there.
Yes, I see.

47:51.128 --> 47:53.648
You know, no matter
how dirty he races, there's no way

47:53.808 --> 47:56.328
we're letting Keith Kopetsky take home
the trophy again this year.

47:56.488 --> 47:59.768
How fast do these things go?
Well, we clocked it at 52.

48:01.888 --> 48:03.688
I can make it faster.

48:03.848 --> 48:05.888
(LAUGHS) Yeah.

48:06.048 --> 48:07.488
OK. Come on. Let's go.
What?

48:07.648 --> 48:09.768
That's good.
What, you don't believe me?

48:09.928 --> 48:12.168
(LAUGHS)
I can.

48:12.328 --> 48:14.968
(ALL SPEAK AT ONCE)

48:15.128 --> 48:17.888
Might be a Thanksgiving pa, huh?
Yeah.

48:18.048 --> 48:19.488
(GASPS)
Are you OK?

48:19.648 --> 48:22.728
Oh, you had me going.
Not until after the pie, alright?

48:22.888 --> 48:24.928
Milk?

48:25.088 --> 48:27.728
Oh, no. I won't be drinking much milk
in the near future.

48:27.888 --> 48:29.488
(LAUGHTER)

48:29.648 --> 48:31.688
Ma, great turkey.
Don't eat too much.

48:31.848 --> 48:34.728
We got feeding to do, and I don't
need you boys in a turkey coma.

48:34.888 --> 48:36.808
Alright.
You've got more work?

48:36.968 --> 48:39.008
Yeah, 24 hours a day.
Really?

48:39.168 --> 48:40.008
Have to.

48:40.168 --> 48:42.488
If you don't milk them,
the cows' udders will explode.

48:44.568 --> 48:46.808
No.
It happened at Frank Monahan's.

48:46.968 --> 48:48.888
And did you actually
see it happen, Mikey?

48:49.048 --> 48:50.448
No.
You're so bad.

48:50.608 --> 48:53.248
You see, Eddie, we gotta work twice
as hard as corporate-owned farms

48:53.408 --> 48:54.768
just to stay afloat.

48:54.928 --> 48:57.208
At this rate, the family farm
will be extinct in 20 years.

48:57.368 --> 48:59.088
I don't think he needs
to hear that now.

48:59.248 --> 49:00.568
No, I'm interested.

49:00.728 --> 49:03.008
What the big boys need to understand
is that we're all interdependent.

49:03.168 --> 49:06.248
And if somebody loses,
eventually, we'll all lose.

49:08.288 --> 49:10.088
What?
Nothing.

49:10.248 --> 49:11.568
MIKE: Thanks, Dad.

49:11.728 --> 49:14.968
So, Eddie, what's up
with you and my sister, huh?

49:15.128 --> 49:18.368
Johnny!
Look, Paige, someone had to ask.

49:18.528 --> 49:20.928
Yeah, Paige, he's too good-looking.
Yeah.

49:21.088 --> 49:22.608
That's right, I said it.
You're too good-looking.

49:22.768 --> 49:24.488
I'm not that good-looking.
I'd say he's pretty good-looking.

49:24.648 --> 49:26.168
Yeah, yeah.
You're pretty good-looking.

49:26.328 --> 49:27.768
Oh, yeah.
Guys!

49:27.928 --> 49:29.928
If you combine that with the accent
and your Euro charm,

49:30.088 --> 49:31.408
you're a lethal combination.

49:31.568 --> 49:32.888
Would everyone just stop? Please.

49:33.048 --> 49:34.688
Paige, we don't even know this guy.

49:34.848 --> 49:36.448
I don't know anyone from Denmark.
No.

49:36.608 --> 49:37.968
I've never heard of anyone
from there.

49:38.128 --> 49:40.128
Have you?
Yeah, sure.

49:44.768 --> 49:46.288
Eddie?

49:47.408 --> 49:50.528
Um, Kierkegaard, Niels Bohr,
Hans Christian Andersen.

49:50.688 --> 49:52.328
Wow.

49:52.488 --> 49:54.648
(MUTTERS) Hans Christian Andersen?

49:56.248 --> 49:58.168
Um, Lars Ulrich.

49:58.328 --> 49:59.768
From Metallica?
From Metallica.

49:59.928 --> 50:00.848
Get out!
OK.

50:01.008 --> 50:04.408
And Helena Christensen.
Whoa, whoa, wait a second.

50:04.568 --> 50:06.048
The Victoria's Secret model?
Yes.

50:06.208 --> 50:08.568
OK. That's gotta be the coolest
country in the world right now.

50:08.728 --> 50:10.488
Seriously, you should
be a superpower.

50:10.648 --> 50:12.928
(LAUGHTER)
Yes.

50:14.848 --> 50:16.488
MAN ON P.A.: Welcome,
ladies and gentlemen,

50:16.648 --> 50:18.768
to the Manitowoc County Fairgrounds.

50:18.928 --> 50:20.408
And a beautiful day for racing

50:20.568 --> 50:24.408
and the 10th annual
Mad Mower Derby!

50:24.568 --> 50:26.528
Give them a hand.
We got the seniors' class.

50:26.688 --> 50:29.208
We've got machines
up to 15 horsepower.

50:29.368 --> 50:30.888
They'll be blasting
by the grandstand here

50:31.048 --> 50:32.728
at a good 8 to 12 miles an hour.

50:32.888 --> 50:34.968
So hang onto your hats
when they come by, folks.

50:35.128 --> 50:37.728
Let them hear it
when they come past the stands here.

50:37.888 --> 50:41.168
Peterson's pulling out of the pit.
Look at him go around that corner.

50:41.328 --> 50:43.808
Come on. Come on!
(REVS ENGINE)

50:43.968 --> 50:46.528
Check it out. Kopetsky.

50:50.048 --> 50:52.168
Whoo!
(REVS ENGINE LOUDLY)

50:54.968 --> 50:56.448
What's up, Keith?

50:57.448 --> 50:59.408
What the hell did you do
to that thing?

51:00.608 --> 51:03.928
I bumped up the compression
and a few other little modifications.

51:04.088 --> 51:05.808
(REVS ENGINE)

51:05.968 --> 51:07.448
(REVS ENGINE)

51:12.288 --> 51:15.168
Alright. One lap to go, folks.
Let them hear it now.

51:15.328 --> 51:18.048
The last of the five laps here
in the senior class.

51:18.208 --> 51:21.648
Osterhouse is pushing.
Now Peterson's moving up.

51:21.808 --> 51:24.128
He's making his move. He's making
his move. Here he comes now.

51:24.288 --> 51:27.208
And here comes Thompson.
There goes Peterson!

51:27.368 --> 51:29.248
(CHEERING)
Go, Mr Peterson!

51:29.408 --> 51:32.608
Mr Peterson?
Oh, he's so daring.

51:37.888 --> 51:40.168
Your brothers seem to like him.
Mom.

51:40.328 --> 51:43.368
I like him too.
Yeah, I get that.

51:43.528 --> 51:46.408
I really can't afford
any distractions right now.

51:47.568 --> 51:50.248
Chemistry isn't just
in a class, kiddo.

51:51.448 --> 51:53.768
And you guys have it.
Right.

51:53.928 --> 51:57.088
Then what happens? I fool myself
into thinking he's Prince Charming?

51:57.248 --> 51:59.208
We get married
and live happily ever after?

51:59.368 --> 52:01.608
Then all my hard work
goes down the drain

52:01.768 --> 52:03.768
because I'm too busy
shopping for groceries

52:03.928 --> 52:05.728
and picking my kids up at soccer.

52:06.928 --> 52:11.048
Sweetie...it really wasn't
as bad as all that.

52:11.208 --> 52:14.368
I didn't mean it that way.
I know.

52:14.528 --> 52:16.888
But we're not talking about me.

52:17.928 --> 52:19.448
I made my choice.

52:21.328 --> 52:23.328
This is about you making
the right choice for you.

52:23.488 --> 52:26.728
MAN ON P.A.: OK, we're getting
ready for the super-modified class.

52:26.888 --> 52:29.608
OK, your brothers
are getting out there.

52:29.768 --> 52:31.448
We have a Le Mans-style start.

52:31.608 --> 52:33.568
The engines will be off.

52:33.728 --> 52:37.128
The drivers, on the gun, will be
running on foot across the track...

52:37.288 --> 52:38.768
Go, Eddie.
..onto the mowers.

52:38.928 --> 52:40.568
Start the mowers and start racing.

52:40.728 --> 52:43.928
Alright, this one's
for all the marbles.

52:44.088 --> 52:47.168
And they've set themselves up
in the line now.

52:47.328 --> 52:49.248
Boys, you've been waiting
all summer for this.

52:49.408 --> 52:51.568
They're getting ready here.
They're champing at the bit, folks.

52:51.728 --> 52:55.848
All set. Listen for the gun
to start it off.

52:56.008 --> 52:58.008
(LAUGHS)
Shut up.

52:58.168 --> 52:59.808
(BANG!)
And they're off. There they go.

52:59.968 --> 53:01.648
Oh, Williams and Kopetsky collide.
Get up!

53:01.808 --> 53:04.648
Williams is on the ground. Get out
of there before they run you over.

53:04.808 --> 53:07.328
They're firing the machines up now.
Number five is up.

53:07.488 --> 53:10.288
Number seven's up.
Kopetsky pulls right out.

53:12.008 --> 53:15.048
Looks like Williams is having
some trouble getting his engine going.

53:15.208 --> 53:16.848
And as they head
into the first turn,

53:17.008 --> 53:19.088
Kopetsky on number eight
is in the lead.

53:19.248 --> 53:22.288
(ENGINE REVS)

53:22.448 --> 53:25.008
Look at that.
Williams got it running.

53:25.168 --> 53:26.848
But he's got a long way to go.

53:28.088 --> 53:29.528
Go, go, go, go, go!

53:29.688 --> 53:31.248
It looks like the Morgan brothers

53:31.408 --> 53:32.848
are really challenging
Kopetsky there.

53:33.008 --> 53:34.448
They are chasing him down.

53:34.608 --> 53:36.768
Ride my tail.
Mike Morgan, on Moovover, second.

53:36.928 --> 53:39.728
And his brother, John,
on number seven, is right behind him.

53:39.888 --> 53:42.688
Williams now is on the track.
He's catching up.

53:42.848 --> 53:45.208
At the back of the pack,
he's starting to move up nicely.

53:45.368 --> 53:48.928
And he's putting on some real speed,
but he is way behind.

53:55.648 --> 53:58.808
And it looks like we've got a duel
shaping up in the front of the pack.

53:58.968 --> 54:01.288
Mike Morgan is really going
after Kopetsky.

54:01.448 --> 54:04.128
Eat it, Morgan!
Watch it!

54:04.288 --> 54:07.008
Morgan goes through
the hay bale there.

54:07.168 --> 54:09.528
It looks like he pushed him
right off the track.

54:09.688 --> 54:12.568
Damn it! God!
Keep it clean there, Kopetsky.

54:12.728 --> 54:14.328
John Morgan is moving up now

54:14.488 --> 54:17.408
to see if he can snatch the lead
away from Kopetsky.

54:19.288 --> 54:20.888
Come on, Eddie!
Go!

54:21.048 --> 54:23.568
And here comes Williams
on number nine.

54:23.728 --> 54:26.528
He's catching up. This could be
a three-way race, folks.

54:26.688 --> 54:28.008
Go, go, go!
Get him!

54:28.168 --> 54:31.528
Kopetsky is trying
to hold him off now.

54:31.688 --> 54:33.288
Weaving back and forth
to the inside.

54:33.448 --> 54:34.888
Williams trying to go
on the outside,

54:35.048 --> 54:36.368
trying to cut on the inside.

54:36.528 --> 54:39.968
Kopetsky will have none of it.
He's holding him off. One lap to go.

54:40.128 --> 54:42.688
Let them hear it, folks.
Going around the third corner.

54:42.848 --> 54:44.488
Go! Go! Go!

54:44.648 --> 54:47.208
Williams, the rookie,
is really out for the gold.

54:47.368 --> 54:48.968
He's coming after Kopetsky
on the inside.

54:49.128 --> 54:52.528
Kopetsky is trying to hold him off
with some quick moves.

54:52.688 --> 54:55.648
Watch out for him, Williams.
He'll mess with you.

54:55.808 --> 54:56.808
Whoa! Whoa!

54:58.888 --> 55:00.728
It's Kopetsky and Williams now.

55:00.888 --> 55:03.208
Oh, my God, they bumped!
Did you see that?

55:03.368 --> 55:05.408
Williams now is coming in first!

55:05.568 --> 55:08.488
Williams, the first-time
rookie rider,

55:08.648 --> 55:12.088
takes the championship
on the super-modifieds.

people around here

56:43.608 --> 56:46.248

about you and me.

56:48.928 --> 56:50.488

Lady Macbeth may have

1:05:06.288 --> 1:05:08.248
Destiny is not something
that you can fight against.

1:05:08.408 --> 1:05:10.848
But what about circumstance?
Take Othello, for instance.

1:05:11.008 --> 1:05:15.568
Was Othello fated to kill Desdemona,
or did lago create the circumstance?

1:05:15.728 --> 1:05:19.448
I think it's both. On the surface,
Iago is the bad guy.

1:05:19.608 --> 1:05:21.568
But if we look closer, we see that

1:05:21.728 --> 1:05:24.008
the crack lago exploited
was of Othello's own making.

1:05:24.168 --> 1:05:27.328
But still, Othello made choices.
Bad ones.

1:05:27.488 --> 1:05:31.048
Othello had love, but he chose
not to listen to his heart.

Love doesn't come around every day,

1:05:32.688 --> 1:05:35.408
and when it does,
you gotta grab it and hold on.

actually became true and...

1:05:50.208 --> 1:05:51.968
...what if there really
is a handsome prince?

But he's a really good kisser.

1:05:54.408 --> 1:05:55.888

1:05:57.688 --> 1:05:59.288
What if you just know
you're in love?

1:05:59.448 --> 1:06:00.288

1:06:00.448 --> 1:06:02.688

(PANTS) OK.

1:11:51.648 --> 1:11:53.128
Hi.

1:11:58.608 --> 1:12:02.248
I now proclaim this session
of Parliament open.

1:12:02.408 --> 1:12:05.128
(APPLAUSE)

1:12:05.288 --> 1:12:07.248
(MUTTERS) Right, let's go.

1:12:14.128 --> 1:12:15.968
Oh, no.
What?

1:12:16.128 --> 1:12:18.048
You didn't tell me
you lived with your parents.

1:12:35.528 --> 1:12:37.928
Hi.
My word!

1:12:38.088 --> 1:12:40.248
Miss Paige.
Oh! Soren!

1:12:40.408 --> 1:12:42.488
Oh, hugging the help?

1:12:42.648 --> 1:12:44.888
You're gonna fit in
very well around here.

1:12:45.048 --> 1:12:50.488
Right. I will see you in a moment
and Soren will show you where to go.

1:12:55.168 --> 1:12:57.128
May I?
Absolutely.

1:12:57.288 --> 1:12:59.248
My pleasure.

1:13:01.848 --> 1:13:04.048
This is the south courtyard.

1:13:04.208 --> 1:13:07.128
You, of course,
came through the private gate.

1:13:07.288 --> 1:13:09.208
Hi.
Miss Paige.

1:13:09.368 --> 1:13:11.248
Right. Hi.

1:13:11.408 --> 1:13:14.048
(GASPS)
This is where we keep the mops.

1:13:14.208 --> 1:13:16.288
Absolutely not!
I love her and she loves me.

1:13:16.448 --> 1:13:18.168
And we will do as we please.
Oh, love.

1:13:18.328 --> 1:13:19.808
And <i>when</i> has it ever
been about that?

1:13:19.968 --> 1:13:22.448
Mother, it has taken us a lot
to get where we are today.

1:13:22.608 --> 1:13:24.048
All we want is to be together.

1:13:24.208 --> 1:13:26.488
It has taken you a lot
to get to where you are?

1:13:26.648 --> 1:13:30.088
It has taken us 1,200 years
to get to where we are.

1:13:30.248 --> 1:13:32.888
In a few weeks time,
you will ascend the throne as king,

1:13:33.048 --> 1:13:35.568
and I will let nothing
stand in the way of that.

1:13:35.728 --> 1:13:38.128
Certainly not some
tawdry little affair

1:13:38.288 --> 1:13:40.128
with a gold-digging American girl

1:13:40.288 --> 1:13:42.888
who dreams of becoming
the next Princess Di.

1:13:43.048 --> 1:13:45.768
Mother, you cannot tell me
whom to love and how to live my life.

1:13:45.928 --> 1:13:50.088
Edvard, I am sure
she has outstanding qualities.

1:13:50.248 --> 1:13:54.088
But once the news of your father's
illness becomes public,

1:13:54.248 --> 1:13:56.968
the people will
require reassurance.

1:13:57.128 --> 1:13:59.008
Yes, and I will proudly
and confidently ascend the throne.

1:13:59.168 --> 1:14:00.768
Good.

1:14:00.928 --> 1:14:03.048
As soon as you allow me
to choose my own bride.

1:14:03.208 --> 1:14:04.528
Out of the question.

1:14:04.688 --> 1:14:06.368
She is a commoner.

1:14:06.528 --> 1:14:09.928
Well, then I hope you think
that Arabella is fit to be the queen

1:14:10.088 --> 1:14:12.288
at the age of 12.

1:14:12.448 --> 1:14:14.448
Oh, no, I'm forgetting.
I'm forgetting about Nestor.

1:14:14.608 --> 1:14:15.928
Oh, don't threaten us!

1:14:16.088 --> 1:14:18.208
Cousin Bartholomew's
idiot son, Nestor,

1:14:18.368 --> 1:14:20.928
the 47-year-old virgin in diapers.

1:14:21.088 --> 1:14:23.128
Oh, the people will rejoice.
Enough!

1:14:24.248 --> 1:14:26.728
Edvard, you will be
the next king of Denmark.

1:14:26.888 --> 1:14:29.008
Do you hear me?
Yes, sir.

1:14:31.888 --> 1:14:33.728
Now, about your young lady.

1:14:33.888 --> 1:14:36.008
If you say you love her as you do,

1:14:36.168 --> 1:14:39.808
and you believe she will
make you happy, then marry her.

1:14:41.128 --> 1:14:42.888
Haraald, you can't mean that.

1:14:43.048 --> 1:14:45.288
Maybe this is not a good time
to discuss...

1:14:45.448 --> 1:14:47.008
No, it's a perfect time.

1:14:47.168 --> 1:14:50.568
It is at the end of a man's life
when he realises

1:14:50.728 --> 1:14:53.528
how important his decisions were
at the beginning.

1:14:57.408 --> 1:15:01.728
And in 1502, King Gustav IV fell,
hit his head on a rock,

1:15:01.888 --> 1:15:04.008
had his famous moment
of enlightenment.

1:15:04.168 --> 1:15:07.088
Claimed that he saw God
at the bottom of this lake.

1:15:07.248 --> 1:15:10.288
He went charging off through
the castle to tell everyone.

1:15:10.448 --> 1:15:12.768
Unfortunately,
he was carrying a torch.

1:15:12.928 --> 1:15:15.288
Curtains caught fire,
burnt down half the palace.

1:15:15.448 --> 1:15:17.408
Thus, observe the new wing.

1:15:17.568 --> 1:15:21.328
He takes great pleasure
in twisting my ancestors' history.

1:15:23.208 --> 1:15:24.688
(LAUGHS)

1:15:29.728 --> 1:15:32.728
Today has been the most
incredible day of my life.

1:15:34.888 --> 1:15:36.528
Come with me.

1:15:40.528 --> 1:15:44.208
I have something important
to tell you.

1:15:44.368 --> 1:15:45.688
Yeah?

1:15:45.848 --> 1:15:48.728
The reason I had to come back

1:15:48.888 --> 1:15:52.648
is because my father has
decided to pass the crown to me.

1:15:52.808 --> 1:15:55.568
So you're gonna be king?

1:15:56.568 --> 1:15:57.568
Yes.

1:16:02.448 --> 1:16:04.688
I love you so much.

1:16:04.848 --> 1:16:07.688
And I know the sacrifices
you would have to make.

1:16:11.248 --> 1:16:12.888
What are you doing?

1:16:20.808 --> 1:16:24.528
Paige Morgan, will you marry me?

1:16:24.688 --> 1:16:26.168
(GASPS)

1:16:30.368 --> 1:16:31.368
Yes!

1:17:33.448 --> 1:17:35.168
Oh, good morning.

1:17:35.328 --> 1:17:37.368
Good morning, ma'am.
Good morning, ma'am.

1:17:40.728 --> 1:17:41.568
Coffee?

1:17:41.728 --> 1:17:44.848
Oh, I can get it myself
if you show me where the kitchen is.

1:17:45.008 --> 1:17:46.688
Or a Starbucks?

1:17:51.968 --> 1:17:55.408
Grande decaf non-fat latte?
Yes, ma'am.

1:17:57.688 --> 1:17:59.448
Congratulations!

1:17:59.608 --> 1:18:02.168
You and Edvard getting married!
It's so romantic!

1:18:02.328 --> 1:18:05.008
You must be Arabella.
Call me Ari.

1:18:05.168 --> 1:18:07.288
Isn't it wonderful?
We're gonna be sisters.

1:18:10.488 --> 1:18:12.048
More hugging?

1:18:12.208 --> 1:18:14.328
Whatever will we do with you?
Thank you.

1:18:14.488 --> 1:18:17.048
Well, then, I thought we might
run through your schedule for the day.

1:18:17.208 --> 1:18:21.408
I have a schedule?
As of this morning you do.

1:18:21.568 --> 1:18:23.288
Come on.

1:18:23.448 --> 1:18:26.408
At 9:00, you have a groundbreaking
with Edvard.

1:18:26.568 --> 1:18:29.008
Also attending
will be Countess Yungen.

1:18:29.168 --> 1:18:31.808
Remember, if you're facing her,
the good eye is the left one.

1:18:31.968 --> 1:18:34.128
At 10:15, there's
a photo opportunity,

1:18:34.288 --> 1:18:37.208
holding hands with Edvard
on the royal yacht.

1:18:37.368 --> 1:18:40.248
Opening of a MirÃ³ exhibit
at the museum at noon.

1:18:40.408 --> 1:18:43.088
12:40 is when you can
call your parents.

1:18:43.248 --> 1:18:45.448
Yes, a 1:00 luncheon
with the Queen.

1:18:45.608 --> 1:18:46.808
(GASPS)

1:18:46.968 --> 1:18:50.808
(BREATHES DEEPLY) Deep breaths.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

1:18:50.968 --> 1:18:52.568
You'll get through this
in spectacular fashion.

1:18:52.728 --> 1:18:56.488
After all, that's what the people
expect of our future queen.

1:18:56.648 --> 1:18:58.608
Oh, my God.

1:18:58.768 --> 1:19:00.248
What?

1:19:01.328 --> 1:19:02.648
Queen.

1:19:02.808 --> 1:19:04.448
I mean, I knew it worked that way,

1:19:04.608 --> 1:19:06.448
but I hadn't really
thought about it like that.

1:19:06.608 --> 1:19:09.928
Do you think that people are gonna mind
if I'm gonna be their queen

1:19:10.088 --> 1:19:11.568
and all I've seen is the airport?

1:19:11.728 --> 1:19:13.928
No.
Uh-uh.

1:19:15.688 --> 1:19:16.728
Anna.

1:19:18.128 --> 1:19:20.288
Do you a have dress
for Eddie's coronation ball yet?

1:19:20.448 --> 1:19:22.448
Um, no.

1:19:22.608 --> 1:19:24.248
You may come in now.

1:19:24.408 --> 1:19:28.088
This is Margueritte.
She can design anything you like.

1:19:28.248 --> 1:19:30.928
Chanel, Dior, Armani, Prada.

1:19:31.088 --> 1:19:33.728
It's very nice to meet you.
Turn.

1:19:33.888 --> 1:19:36.448
Excuse me?
Turn.

1:19:37.848 --> 1:19:39.368
Come, ladies.

1:19:41.088 --> 1:19:42.728
Long torso.

1:19:42.888 --> 1:19:44.488
Good figure.

1:19:45.728 --> 1:19:47.448
Terrible American posture.

1:19:49.808 --> 1:19:51.568
I don't work with hunchbacks.

1:19:52.608 --> 1:19:54.888
When is the wedding, Miss Morgan?
Good morning.

1:19:56.008 --> 1:19:57.808
When these plants are completed,

1:19:57.968 --> 1:20:00.128
Denmark will lead
the European community

1:20:00.288 --> 1:20:03.488
in vegetable oil
and specialty fat production.

1:20:18.608 --> 1:20:21.528

Farm girl.
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

1:20:33.528 --> 1:20:36.208
So where do the future king and queen
go on their honeymoon?

1:20:36.368 --> 1:20:38.048
I was thinking Morocco.

1:20:38.208 --> 1:20:40.408
It's really hard
to organise security there.

1:20:40.568 --> 1:20:42.048
Oh, right, OK.

1:20:42.208 --> 1:20:44.808
What about Spain?
Mmm. Yes, Spain is good.

1:20:44.968 --> 1:20:47.808
I'm sure King Juan Carlos won't
mind lending us his private island

1:20:47.968 --> 1:20:50.208
for a few weeks in the summer.

1:20:57.728 --> 1:20:59.688
Well, it's hanging well
in the front.

1:20:59.848 --> 1:21:01.368
Is this part supposed to be loose?

1:21:01.528 --> 1:21:03.328
She doesn't speak.
At all?

1:21:03.488 --> 1:21:05.208
To you.
Oh.

1:21:05.368 --> 1:21:07.448
Well, is this part
supposed to be loose?

1:21:07.608 --> 1:21:10.128
Well, it has been worn that way
for the past 200 years.

1:21:13.448 --> 1:21:16.448
(STATELY MUSIC)

1:21:19.488 --> 1:21:22.488
(SPEAKS INAUDIBLY)

1:21:36.928 --> 1:21:41.488
The opening of this new wing
of the DangÃ¥rd Paediatric Hospital...

1:21:41.648 --> 1:21:43.968
(WHISPERS) Where's Paige?
I don't know.

1:21:44.128 --> 1:21:46.728
...our country's commitment
to improving healthcare

1:21:46.888 --> 1:21:48.528
for all of our people.

1:21:50.448 --> 1:21:52.048
(WHISPERS) There she is.

1:21:56.968 --> 1:21:59.408
I was just being nice to some kids.

1:21:59.568 --> 1:22:02.168
Which every paper
felt compelled to report.

1:22:02.328 --> 1:22:04.888
Well, what's wrong with that?

1:22:05.048 --> 1:22:07.648
That you did it in
a new, state-of-the-art,

1:22:07.808 --> 1:22:11.368
government-funded,
billion-kroner hospital,

1:22:11.528 --> 1:22:14.368
which suddenly all these newspapers
have no interest in mentioning.

1:22:14.528 --> 1:22:16.048
Oh.

1:22:16.208 --> 1:22:19.848
We had an opportunity
on the eve of a national strike,

1:22:20.008 --> 1:22:22.728
to show the people what their
healthcare system can do for them.

1:22:22.888 --> 1:22:25.248
Instead, all they know
is that you are nice to children.

1:22:25.408 --> 1:22:26.848
I'm sorry. I'm trying.

1:22:27.008 --> 1:22:29.568
It's gonna take me a while
to get the hang of things.

1:22:29.728 --> 1:22:33.048
Being royal is not like
being famous or being rich.

1:22:33.208 --> 1:22:35.128
It is something much, much more.

1:22:35.288 --> 1:22:39.288
It is a way of being that can
only be learned from birth.

1:22:39.448 --> 1:22:42.408
It is...an embodiment

1:22:42.568 --> 1:22:46.768
which requires you to sacrifice
who you are for who you must be.

1:22:46.928 --> 1:22:51.288
Well, I'm Paige Morgan
from Manitowoc, Wisconsin.

1:22:51.448 --> 1:22:53.528
Paige Morgan can no longer exist.

1:22:53.688 --> 1:22:55.128
She is gone.

1:22:55.288 --> 1:22:59.408
You are now
the future queen of Denmark...

1:23:00.528 --> 1:23:02.008
...plain and simple.

1:23:10.288 --> 1:23:11.968
Excuse me, Your Majesty.

1:23:12.128 --> 1:23:14.888
Your Royal Highness,
it's time to leave.

1:23:15.048 --> 1:23:17.128
Alright. Thank you, Soren. Thank you.

1:23:29.568 --> 1:23:31.408
His Royal Highness
the Crown Prince.

1:23:31.568 --> 1:23:33.048
Royal Highness.
Prime Minister.

1:23:33.208 --> 1:23:35.608
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

1:23:35.768 --> 1:23:37.368
In the interest of expedience,

1:23:37.528 --> 1:23:39.808
I've asked the lead negotiator
for the national unions

1:23:39.968 --> 1:23:42.088
and the lead negotiator
for our nation's corporate interests

1:23:42.248 --> 1:23:44.168
to join us.

1:23:44.328 --> 1:23:46.248
How do you do?
I'm very pleased to meet you.

1:23:46.408 --> 1:23:48.008
Nice to meet you again.

1:23:49.168 --> 1:23:50.648
Your Royal Highness.

1:23:50.808 --> 1:23:53.008
I know your exposure
to these proceedings

1:23:53.168 --> 1:23:54.648
has been rather limited...

1:23:54.808 --> 1:23:56.408
Mr Anderson, I'm well aware

1:23:56.568 --> 1:23:58.368
of the traditions and the protocols
of this chamber,

1:23:58.528 --> 1:24:00.008
and while I respect them,

1:24:00.168 --> 1:24:02.328
we only have six hours
before all hell breaks loose.

1:24:02.488 --> 1:24:05.448
So don't you think the time
for gamesmanship has passed?

1:24:05.608 --> 1:24:08.048
Yes, sir.
Then we are in agreement.

1:24:08.208 --> 1:24:09.848
Please be seated.

1:24:11.528 --> 1:24:13.208
And get comfortable,

1:24:13.368 --> 1:24:15.848
because we're not leaving here
until this is solved.

1:24:19.088 --> 1:24:20.928
And where will this
additional money come from?

1:24:21.088 --> 1:24:23.128
Well, perhaps management
will tighten their belts.

1:24:23.288 --> 1:24:24.648
Our belts?
Yes!

1:24:24.808 --> 1:24:26.528
It might do you some good
to go without.

1:24:26.688 --> 1:24:28.128
These are businesses, not charities.

1:24:28.288 --> 1:24:30.688
Look, gentlemen, if we can't come to
a resolution about wages,

1:24:30.848 --> 1:24:32.448
perhaps we can discuss
concessions on benefits.

1:24:32.608 --> 1:24:33.808
No concessions!

1:24:33.968 --> 1:24:36.368
You take and take
and will give nothing in return!

1:24:36.528 --> 1:24:37.648
You are impossible!

1:24:37.808 --> 1:24:39.928
Gentlemen, please.
Let's remember this is not about us.

1:24:45.008 --> 1:24:47.688
You know, when I was in America,

1:24:47.848 --> 1:24:50.408
I spent some time
with Paige's family on her farm.

1:24:50.568 --> 1:24:51.528
(SIGHS)

1:24:51.688 --> 1:24:55.208
And they explained something to me --
that we are all interdependent.

1:24:56.248 --> 1:24:57.968
So we had better start caring
for our opposition

1:24:58.128 --> 1:24:59.688
as much as we do for ourselves.

1:25:02.208 --> 1:25:03.848
I wonder if anyone
on this table knows

1:25:04.008 --> 1:25:05.928
what it's like to work
for a tiny wage.

1:25:06.088 --> 1:25:10.008
And then to see that wage get
sliced up even further by taxes.

1:25:10.168 --> 1:25:12.888
Now, I can tell you from experience,
it can be a mighty struggle.

1:25:13.048 --> 1:25:16.528
But then I suspect it would be
substantially more difficult

1:25:16.688 --> 1:25:21.848
to see your job and your benefits
disappear altogether.

1:25:22.008 --> 1:25:26.248
Now, at the moment, we are 6% apart.
Correct?

1:25:26.408 --> 1:25:29.608
Now, if the goal is
to let the workers keep more

1:25:29.768 --> 1:25:31.248
without damaging the corporation,

1:25:31.408 --> 1:25:34.088
then perhaps there is
a third path to consider.

1:25:35.568 --> 1:25:37.048
He was brilliant.

1:25:37.208 --> 1:25:38.648
He got the unions
to lower their demands,

1:25:38.808 --> 1:25:40.208
the corporations
to raise their offer,

1:25:40.368 --> 1:25:43.128
and Parliament to cut the workers'
wage tax to make up the difference.

1:25:43.288 --> 1:25:44.608
Now, that's impressive.

1:25:44.768 --> 1:25:46.168
OK, about the dress.

1:25:46.328 --> 1:25:48.728
Am I supposed to be able to breathe?
No.

1:25:48.888 --> 1:25:50.528
Oh, well, then it's perfect.

1:25:50.688 --> 1:25:54.408
Miss Paige, the Queen would
like to see you immediately.

1:25:56.208 --> 1:25:59.048
Don't worry. I'll be by your side
the entire time.

1:26:10.568 --> 1:26:13.048
Soren, get out.
Yes, Your Majesty.

1:26:14.088 --> 1:26:15.568

1:26:32.048 --> 1:26:35.528
I know you think I don't like you.
Uh...

1:26:41.008 --> 1:26:43.088
I like traditions.

1:26:44.208 --> 1:26:48.808
I like traditions, and I like
consistency and continuity,

1:26:48.968 --> 1:26:51.168
and I don't like change.

1:26:52.968 --> 1:26:56.968
But...when that change
is for the better...

1:26:58.728 --> 1:27:01.648
...when it helps turn a boy
into a man,

1:27:01.808 --> 1:27:04.408
then I have to reconsider.

1:27:07.048 --> 1:27:10.488
Two weeks ago, I thought you were
the end of the monarchy.

1:27:12.248 --> 1:27:15.248
Now I see you may be the best thing
that ever happened to us.

1:27:17.128 --> 1:27:18.608
