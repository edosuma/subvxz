01:12.400 --> 01:14.925
<i>Those were the years</i>
<i>after the ice caps had melted...</i>

01:15.036 --> 01:17.971
<i>because of</i>
<i>the greenhouse gases,</i>

01:18.073 --> 01:20.564
<i>and the oceans had risen</i>
<i>to drown so many cities...</i>

01:20.675 --> 01:23.610
<i>along all the shorelines</i>
<i>of the world.</i>

01:23.712 --> 01:27.910
<i>Amsterdam, Venice, New York...</i>

01:28.016 --> 01:29.916
<i>forever lost.</i>

01:30.018 --> 01:32.851
<i>Millions of people</i>
<i>were displaced.</i>

01:32.954 --> 01:35.821
<i>Climates became chaotic.</i>

01:35.924 --> 01:39.485
<i>Hundreds of millions of people</i>
<i>starved in poorer countries.</i>

01:39.594 --> 01:41.721
<i>Elsewhere, a high degree</i>
<i>of prosperity survived...</i>

01:41.830 --> 01:43.764
<i>when most governments</i>
<i>in the developed world...</i>

01:43.865 --> 01:48.199
<i>introduced legal sanctions to</i>
<i>strictly license pregnancies,</i>

01:48.303 --> 01:50.771
<i>which was why robots,</i>

01:50.872 --> 01:53.170
<i>who are never hungry and who</i>
<i>did not consume resources...</i>

01:53.274 --> 01:55.708
<i>beyond those</i>
<i>of their first manufacture,</i>

01:55.810 --> 01:59.473
<i>were so essential</i>
<i>an economic link...</i>

01:59.581 --> 02:01.811
<i>in the chain mail of society.</i>

02:01.916 --> 02:05.943
To create an artificial being
has been the dream of man...

02:06.054 --> 02:08.044
since the birth of science

02:09.657 --> 02:11.716
Not merely the beginning
of the modern age...

02:11.826 --> 02:15.421
when our forbearers astonished the
world with the first thinking machines...

02:15.530 --> 02:17.589
primitive monsters
that could play chess

02:17.699 --> 02:20.031
How far we have come

02:22.036 --> 02:24.197
The artificial being
is a reality...

02:24.305 --> 02:27.365
of perfect simulacrum...

02:27.475 --> 02:29.909
articulated in limb

02:30.011 --> 02:32.878
articulate in speech...

02:32.981 --> 02:35.176
and not lacking
in human response

02:41.156 --> 02:44.421
And even pain-memory response

02:49.197 --> 02:53.099
How did that make you feel?
Angry? Shocked?

02:53.201 --> 02:57.228
- I don't understand.
- What did I do to your feelings?

02:57.338 --> 02:59.238
You did it to my hand

03:00.809 --> 03:02.640
All right

03:04.078 --> 03:06.740
There's the rub

03:06.848 --> 03:10.807
Undress.
At Cybertronics of New Jersey

03:10.919 --> 03:13.854
the artificial being
has reached its highest form

03:13.955 --> 03:16.048
The universally-adopted Mecha…

03:16.157 --> 03:19.615
the basis for hundreds of models
serving the human race...

03:19.727 --> 03:22.252
in all the multiplicity
of daily life

03:22.363 --> 03:24.422
That's far enough

03:24.532 --> 03:27.592
But we have no reason
to congratulate ourselves

03:28.803 --> 03:32.899
We are rightly proud of it

03:33.007 --> 03:35.100
but what does it amount to?

03:35.210 --> 03:37.110
Sheila, open

03:56.731 --> 03:59.325
A sensory toy...

03:59.434 --> 04:02.733
with intelligent
behavioral circuits...

04:02.837 --> 04:05.772
using neurone-sequencing
technology...

04:05.874 --> 04:08.434
as old as I am

04:10.712 --> 04:16.082
I believe that my work on mapping the
impulse pathways in a single neurone...

04:16.184 --> 04:19.119
can enable us to construct...

04:19.220 --> 04:22.212
a Mecha of a qualitatively
different order

04:24.359 --> 04:26.827
I propose...

04:26.928 --> 04:29.158
that we build a robot...

04:30.832 --> 04:33.426
- who can love.
- Love?

04:35.136 --> 04:40.164
- But we ship thousands of lover models every month.
- Of course

04:40.275 --> 04:43.608
You're your own best customer,
Syatyoo-Sama.

04:43.711 --> 04:47.112
Quality control is very important.

04:58.660 --> 05:02.027
Tell me. What is love?

05:02.130 --> 05:04.758
Love is first widening
my eyes a little bit...

05:04.866 --> 05:06.766
and quickening my breathing
a little...

05:06.868 --> 05:08.768
and warming my skin
and touching my...

05:08.870 --> 05:10.997
And so on. Exactly so.
Thank you, Sheila

05:13.107 --> 05:15.974
But I wasn't referring
to sensuality simulators

05:16.077 --> 05:19.308
The word that I used was love.

05:19.414 --> 05:22.042
Love like the love of a child
for its parents

05:22.150 --> 05:26.780
I propose that we build
a robot child who can love

05:26.888 --> 05:29.686
A robot child
who will genuinely love…

05:29.791 --> 05:31.782
the parent or parents
it imprints on...

05:31.893 --> 05:33.793
with a love that will never end

05:33.895 --> 05:35.795
A child-substitute Mecha?

05:35.897 --> 05:39.890
But a Mecha with a mind,
with neuronal feedback

05:40.001 --> 05:43.232
You see, what I'm suggesting
is that love will be the key...

05:43.338 --> 05:47.001
by which they acquire a kind of
subconscious never before achieved

05:47.108 --> 05:49.770
An inner world of metaphor,
of intuition

05:49.877 --> 05:52.402
of self-motivated reasoning

05:52.513 --> 05:55.141
- of dreams.
- A robot that dreams?

05:55.249 --> 05:58.480
- Yes.
- How exactly do we pull this off?

05:58.586 --> 06:00.486
You know, it occurs to me...

06:00.588 --> 06:05.218
with all this animus
existing against Mechas today

06:05.326 --> 06:08.921
it isn't simply a question
of creating a robot who can love

06:09.030 --> 06:13.797
But isn't the real conundrum,
can you get a human to love them back?

06:13.901 --> 06:16.699
Ours will be a perfect child
caught in a freeze-frame...

06:16.804 --> 06:19.102
always loving,
never ill, never changing

06:19.207 --> 06:22.768
With all the childless couples
yearning in vain for a license

06:22.877 --> 06:25.641
our little Mecha will not only
open up a completely new market

06:25.747 --> 06:27.647
but it will fill
a great human need

06:27.749 --> 06:30.843
But you haven't answered
my question

06:30.952 --> 06:34.911
If a robot could genuinely
love a person

06:35.023 --> 06:39.653
what responsibility does that person
hold toward that Mecha in return?

06:41.396 --> 06:44.263
It's a moral question,
isn't it?

06:44.365 --> 06:46.560
The oldest one of all

06:46.667 --> 06:50.034
But in the beginning, didn't God
create Adam to love Him?

08:21.095 --> 08:24.155
<i>The baby was born</i>
<i>as the first leaves of autumn fell.</i>

08:24.265 --> 08:28.702
A baby boy.
And Marian's wish came true

08:28.803 --> 08:30.998
The boy had white hair

08:31.105 --> 08:34.938
He was baptized Martin,
after his grandfather

08:42.683 --> 08:45.379
- Dr. Frazier. Hi. Good to see you.
- Hello, Henry

08:45.486 --> 08:48.853
Listen, there was an article by Random
Bach in the <i>Journal of Chinese Medicine.</i>

08:48.956 --> 08:51.151
- They talked about these virus locators,
- Hello again, Monica

08:51.259 --> 08:53.159
Microscopic synthetic
hunter killers

08:53.261 --> 08:55.252
<i>- Did you read that article?</i>
- I can still hear you

09:00.368 --> 09:03.098
- I'm worried about her, Henry. She's really got me worried.
- Yeah, I know

09:03.204 --> 09:05.138
She's in the most difficult
position of feeling...

09:05.239 --> 09:07.571
she should mourn
the death of your son

09:07.675 --> 09:11.042
After five years, your instincts
tell you to mourn him too

09:11.145 --> 09:13.705
But medicine assures us that
mourning is inappropriate...

09:13.814 --> 09:16.715
- that Martin is merely pending.
- Pending

09:19.554 --> 09:22.182
So all her grief
goes undigested

09:25.726 --> 09:28.786
Henry, your son
may be beyond our science

09:28.896 --> 09:30.887
but it's your wife
who can still be reached

09:42.476 --> 09:44.842
The screening process
was extremely difficult

09:44.946 --> 09:47.073
It was almost tougher
than building the prototype

09:47.181 --> 09:49.149
Of our 2,000 employees,
a surprising few...

09:49.250 --> 09:51.514
met your minimum requirements
for the in-house testing

09:51.619 --> 09:55.248
Initiate. Employment record,
quality of lifestyle...

09:55.356 --> 09:58.655
Query, internal data...

09:58.759 --> 10:03.890
loyalty to the firm,
and in this individual's case

10:03.998 --> 10:07.729
a family tragedy
that may qualify him above the rest

10:11.639 --> 10:13.334
I'll see him

10:17.812 --> 10:19.712
- Henry!
- Don't kill me

10:19.814 --> 10:21.782
Henry, what are you doing?

10:23.985 --> 10:26.715
I love you. Don't kill me

10:29.290 --> 10:31.190
The door's closed

11:10.398 --> 11:12.423
I like your floor

11:23.377 --> 11:25.845
I can't accept this!

11:25.946 --> 11:28.244
There is no substitute
for your own child!

11:28.349 --> 11:31.409
You don't have to accept it or even try.
It's not too late to take him back

11:31.519 --> 11:33.419
What were you thinking?

11:33.521 --> 11:35.546
- I'll do whatever you want me to do.
- Do you think I can just...

11:35.656 --> 11:39.558
- I can just...
- I'll do whatever you want me to do!

11:39.660 --> 11:42.026
I don't know what to do

11:42.129 --> 11:46.293
I know, I know. I'll return him to
Cybertronics first thing in the morning

11:46.400 --> 11:48.300
It's gone

11:50.838 --> 11:53.136
Good

11:53.240 --> 11:55.208
I mean, Henry,
did you see his face?

11:55.309 --> 11:57.470
He's...

11:57.578 --> 11:59.478
He's so real

12:01.749 --> 12:04.547
- But he's not.
- No, he's not

12:04.652 --> 12:07.485
I mean, inside he's like
all the rest, isn't he?

12:07.588 --> 12:09.749
A hundred miles of fiber, yeah

12:12.193 --> 12:15.185
But outside,
he just looks so real...

12:17.965 --> 12:20.263
like he is a child

12:21.569 --> 12:23.969
A Mecha child

12:30.344 --> 12:32.244
A child

13:06.080 --> 13:10.540
The show of faith my company has
placed on me, on us, is extraordinary

13:10.651 --> 13:12.949
Now, there are a few simple
procedures we need to follow...

13:13.053 --> 13:15.351
if and when
you decide to keep David

13:15.456 --> 13:17.981
If you decide to keep him,
there's an imprinting protocol...

13:18.092 --> 13:20.356
consisting of a code string
of seven particular words...

13:20.461 --> 13:23.919
which need to be spoken to David in the
predefined order that's been printed here

13:24.031 --> 13:26.261
Now, Monica,
for our own protection

13:26.367 --> 13:28.528
this imprinting is irreversible

13:28.636 --> 13:30.968
The robot child's love would be
sealed... in a sense, hardwired...

13:31.071 --> 13:33.005
and would be
part of him forever

13:33.107 --> 13:35.007
Because of this,
after imprinting

13:35.109 --> 13:37.134
no Mecha child can be resold

13:37.244 --> 13:39.678
If an adopted parent should
ever decide not to keep the child

13:39.780 --> 13:42.977
they must return it
to Cybertronics for destruction

13:43.083 --> 13:47.247
I had to sign a letter of agreement,
or they wouldn't even let you see David

13:47.354 --> 13:49.254
You have to sign it too.
Right here

13:50.825 --> 13:55.262
Monica, don't imprint
until you're entirely sure

13:56.730 --> 14:00.257
Silly man.
Of course I'm not sure

14:28.362 --> 14:30.592
Would you like me to sleep now?

14:31.932 --> 14:33.923
Good idea. Good idea.

14:34.034 --> 14:37.629
- Monica?
- Well, it's late, you know

14:37.738 --> 14:40.206
- It's after 9:00, so...
- Yeah. Ten past

14:40.307 --> 14:43.606
How-How late
do they let you stay up?

14:43.711 --> 14:45.838
I can never go to sleep

14:45.946 --> 14:49.473
But I can lay quietly
and not make a peep

14:49.583 --> 14:53.576
So, those pajamas will fit you, and we'll be
in to check on you first thing in the morning

14:53.687 --> 14:55.678
Dress me?

14:55.789 --> 14:59.816
You know, I'm gonna say good night
while you boys be boys

15:03.964 --> 15:05.864
Raise your arms

17:42.990 --> 17:45.015
- Is it a game?
- Yes

17:46.427 --> 17:49.123
Hide-and-seek

17:49.229 --> 17:51.129
I found you

17:53.133 --> 17:55.624
That's your room.
Just, go and play

18:16.690 --> 18:19.921
I found you

18:20.027 --> 18:22.757
Out! Out! Get out of here!

18:22.863 --> 18:25.127
And close the goddamn door!

20:08.502 --> 20:12.063
<i>I can't...</i>

22:14.995 --> 22:17.122
Is it a game?

22:17.230 --> 22:19.425
Now, I'm gonna read some words

22:19.533 --> 22:22.525
And, they won't make any sense

22:22.636 --> 22:25.070
but I want you to
listen to them anyway...

22:25.172 --> 22:28.539
and look at me all the time

22:28.642 --> 22:32.601
- Can you do that?
- Yes, Monica

22:38.352 --> 22:41.651
Can you feel my hand
on the back of your neck?

22:41.755 --> 22:43.882
Yes

22:43.991 --> 22:46.721
- Does any of this hurt?
- No

22:46.827 --> 22:50.422
Okay, now, look at me

22:52.032 --> 22:53.932
Ready?

22:56.903 --> 22:58.803
Cirrus

23:01.041 --> 23:02.872
Socrates

23:05.045 --> 23:06.945
Particle

23:08.682 --> 23:10.946
Decibel

23:12.786 --> 23:14.651
Hurricane

23:14.755 --> 23:16.655
Dolphin

23:18.392 --> 23:20.292
Tulip

23:22.396 --> 23:24.296
Monica

23:26.466 --> 23:29.094
David

23:29.202 --> 23:31.102
Monica

23:42.482 --> 23:44.382
All right

23:46.053 --> 23:49.614
I wonder if I did that right.
I don't...

23:50.891 --> 23:53.052
What were those words for,
Mommy?

23:58.031 --> 23:59.931
What did you call me?

24:01.668 --> 24:03.533
Mommy

24:05.906 --> 24:08.306
Who am I, David?

24:12.412 --> 24:14.539
You are my mommy

24:36.536 --> 24:39.232
You smell lovely

24:39.339 --> 24:41.239
I love it when
you wear this stuff

24:41.341 --> 24:43.775
- Will you still love me when it's all gone?
- No

24:43.877 --> 24:45.868
- Stop it.
- But we can get married again...

24:45.979 --> 24:48.880
and begin with a fragrance
that's not in such short supply

24:48.982 --> 24:50.950
We gotta go.
Come on. We're late

24:54.788 --> 24:56.847
- Hello, David.
- Hello, Henry

24:56.957 --> 24:59.016
- Walk us out, all right, sweetheart?
- Come on

25:01.728 --> 25:03.821
My shoe!

25:09.136 --> 25:11.195
<i>- Henry, your tie!</i>
<i>- I know, I know.</i>

25:11.304 --> 25:13.204
<i>You're hopeless!</i>

25:13.306 --> 25:16.798
<i>He's trying so hard</i>
<i>to please me.</i>

25:16.910 --> 25:20.141
- He has a way with my coffee.
- And it's creepy

25:20.247 --> 25:23.774
- You can never hear him coming. He's just always there.
- He is only a child

25:23.884 --> 25:26.478
Monica, he's a toy

25:26.586 --> 25:28.884
He's a gift...

25:28.989 --> 25:30.889
from you

25:32.559 --> 25:36.051
David, when we leave, all the doors
and windows will go smart

25:36.163 --> 25:39.223
So you can't leave your room.
But if you'd like...

25:39.332 --> 25:42.358
- Oh, I put way too much on.
- Do I smell lovely?

25:45.605 --> 25:47.505
Oh, God, no

25:59.386 --> 26:01.411
<i>Mommy,</i>

26:01.521 --> 26:03.421
will you die?

26:08.261 --> 26:11.389
Well, one day, David,
yes, I will

26:16.603 --> 26:19.128
I'll be alone

26:19.239 --> 26:21.207
Don't worry yourself so

26:31.751 --> 26:33.651
How long will you live?

26:35.522 --> 26:38.218
For ages

26:38.325 --> 26:41.260
For 50 years

26:41.361 --> 26:43.556
I love you, Mommy

26:45.098 --> 26:47.566
I hope you never die

26:48.935 --> 26:50.835
Never

26:53.807 --> 26:56.776
- Yes.
<i>- Darling!</i>

26:56.876 --> 27:00.004
We're becoming unfashionably,
unreasonably late

27:03.984 --> 27:05.884
Hello?

27:26.806 --> 27:29.434
This belonged to Martin, my son

27:57.671 --> 27:59.605
His name is Teddy

27:59.706 --> 28:01.606
Teddy, this is David

28:03.610 --> 28:06.909
- Hello, Teddy.
- Hello, David

28:07.013 --> 28:08.913
David, Teddy is a super toy

28:09.015 --> 28:12.109
and I know you will take
good care of each other

28:12.218 --> 28:14.448
I am <i>not</i> a toy

28:15.989 --> 28:18.389
<i>Henry?</i>

28:18.491 --> 28:20.584
- Sorry.
- What were you doing up there?

28:20.694 --> 28:23.390
I'll tell you in the car.
Come on

28:33.640 --> 28:36.768
Is 50 years a long time?

28:40.613 --> 28:42.513
I don't think so

28:43.183 --> 28:44.514
David, I'll get it!

28:53.693 --> 28:55.593
Honey, hand it to me

28:55.695 --> 28:58.186
Look what I can do

29:04.571 --> 29:06.471
Hello?

29:06.573 --> 29:09.303
Yes?

29:09.409 --> 29:11.536
Mrs. Swinton,
could you hold a moment?

29:11.644 --> 29:13.544
I have an urgent call
from your husband

29:13.646 --> 29:16.774
Yes, I will. David, I-I need
to talk to the phone now

29:16.883 --> 29:20.410
Monica?
Monica? Can you hear me, Monica?

29:20.520 --> 29:23.956
- Let the phone talk now.
- Monica, can you hear me? Pick up the phone, Monica!

29:24.057 --> 29:27.652
- Run along. Play with Teddy.
- Pick up the phone, Monica! Oh, my God! Mon¡

29:29.095 --> 29:31.256
Hello, Henry?
What is it? What...

29:32.866 --> 29:35.232
What?

29:35.335 --> 29:37.235
When?

29:39.739 --> 29:41.639
Oh, God

29:57.724 --> 29:59.783
David

29:59.893 --> 30:03.021
the most wonderful thing
in the whole world has happened

30:06.699 --> 30:09.497
This is Martin

30:09.602 --> 30:11.502
This is my son

30:27.053 --> 30:28.953
Martin, no!

30:32.959 --> 30:36.053
We'll have a contest
to see who he comes to first

30:41.901 --> 30:43.960
Come here, Teddy!
Come here, boy!

30:44.070 --> 30:46.868
<i>Teddy! Come here!</i>

30:46.973 --> 30:48.873
You call him too

30:50.777 --> 30:52.677
Come here, Teddy

30:52.779 --> 30:55.714
<i>- Come on! Teddy! Teddy!</i>
- Come here, boy

30:55.815 --> 30:59.376
- Come here! Come on, Teddy!
- Come here, Teddy

30:59.486 --> 31:02.080
<i>- Teddy. Come here, Teddy.</i>
<i>- Teddy, come!</i>

31:02.188 --> 31:04.486
- Come here, Teddy.
- Come, Teddy! Come!

31:08.695 --> 31:10.595
Mommy! Mommy!

31:14.868 --> 31:17.769
Are they torturing you, Teddy?

31:17.871 --> 31:22.672
He used to be a super toy,
but now he's old and stupid

31:25.879 --> 31:28.279
You want him?

31:28.381 --> 31:30.281
Yes, please

31:30.383 --> 31:32.681
So I guess now
you're the new super toy

31:32.785 --> 31:34.719
So, what good stuff can you do?

31:34.821 --> 31:39.190
Oh, can you do power stuff,
like walk on the ceiling or the walls?

31:39.292 --> 31:42.227
Anti-gravity?
Like, float or fly?

31:42.328 --> 31:45.058
Can you?

31:45.164 --> 31:49.260
No, because I'm <i>real.</i>

31:57.210 --> 32:00.805
- Can you break this?
- I better not

32:00.914 --> 32:04.475
These things, they do look better
in pieces. They do

32:04.584 --> 32:06.575
I can't

32:11.891 --> 32:13.791
Stand up

32:20.099 --> 32:23.830
Look, they made you
bigger than me

32:23.937 --> 32:26.405
- Who did?
- Well, they did... the doll makers

32:26.506 --> 32:28.406
They made you taller

32:32.679 --> 32:34.670
Why don't you look like one?

32:34.781 --> 32:37.272
Like one?

32:37.383 --> 32:41.080
You're not cute like a doll

32:41.187 --> 32:43.747
You just look like
someone's ordinary kid

32:46.392 --> 32:48.986
When's your birthday?

32:49.095 --> 32:50.995
I never had a birthday

32:51.097 --> 32:53.463
Okay. When were
you first built?

32:53.566 --> 32:55.466
When's your build-day?

32:57.837 --> 32:59.737
I don't remember

33:02.575 --> 33:05.635
Okay, what's the first thing
you can remember?

33:09.882 --> 33:12.715
- A bird.
- What sort of bird?

33:15.755 --> 33:19.020
A bird with big wings...

33:19.125 --> 33:21.787
and feathers sticking up
from the bottom

33:21.894 --> 33:23.794
Can you draw it?

33:23.896 --> 33:26.330
Yes

33:45.518 --> 33:47.418
<i>That looks like a peacock.</i>

33:47.520 --> 33:50.250
Can you say peacock?

33:50.356 --> 33:53.723
- Peacock.
- Can you say pee?

33:53.826 --> 33:56.989
- Pee.
- Now say that two times fast

34:07.907 --> 34:10.034
<i>Okay.</i>

34:10.143 --> 34:12.110
<i>Then you gotta put</i>
<i>the green ones...</i>

34:12.210 --> 34:15.237
- Read to us?
- Hey

34:15.348 --> 34:17.248
Let's see

34:19.452 --> 34:21.351
Oh, yeah

34:26.458 --> 34:29.518
David's going to <i>love</i> it

34:31.731 --> 34:35.063
As soon as his show was over,
the showman went into the kitchen

34:35.168 --> 34:37.636
where the whole sheep which
he was preparing for supper...

34:37.737 --> 34:40.900
was roasting on
the slowly-turning spit in the furnace

34:41.007 --> 34:43.873
When he saw there was not
enough wood to finish roasting it

34:43.976 --> 34:47.377
he called Harlequin
and the Punchinello and said

34:47.480 --> 34:51.416
'Bring me in Pinocchio.
You will find him hanging on a nail

34:51.516 --> 34:53.417
'He is made of nice, dry wood

34:53.518 --> 34:55.953
and I'm sure he will make
a nice fire for my roast.'

34:56.054 --> 34:58.751
<i>Pinocchio worked</i>
<i>until midnight.</i>

34:58.858 --> 35:01.520
<i>And instead of making</i>
<i>eight baskets,</i>

35:01.627 --> 35:04.721
<i>he made sixteen.</i>

35:04.831 --> 35:08.631
<i>Then he went to bed</i>
<i>and fell asleep.</i>

35:08.735 --> 35:14.002
As he slept, he dreamt he saw
the fairy, lovely and smiling

35:14.107 --> 35:16.473
who gave him a kiss, saying

35:16.576 --> 35:18.476
'Brave Pinocchio

35:18.578 --> 35:24.210
<i>'in return for your good heart,</i>
<i>I forgive all your past misdeeds.</i>

35:24.317 --> 35:27.912
<i>Be good in future,</i>
<i>and you will be happy. '</i>

35:28.020 --> 35:31.956
Then the dream ended
and Pinocchio awoke

35:32.058 --> 35:34.322
full of amazement

35:34.427 --> 35:36.520
<i>You can imagine</i>
<i>how astonished he was...</i>

35:36.629 --> 35:40.622
<i>when he saw that he was</i>
<i>no longer a puppet...</i>

35:40.733 --> 35:44.829
<i>but a real boy</i>
<i>just like other boys.</i>

35:50.109 --> 35:53.704
Josephine evidently
has taken a leave of absence

35:53.813 --> 35:55.747
Oh, my God.

35:55.848 --> 35:59.409
<i>- Well, I saw that coming.</i>
<i>- How could you see that coming?</i>

35:59.519 --> 36:03.011
<i>- They were fabulous together.
- Oh, come on! She was miserable! I mean...</i>

36:03.122 --> 36:05.556
<i>- Well, he never said they were miserable.
- Yeah, that's because...</i>

36:05.658 --> 36:07.592
<i>Wasn't that</i>
<i>because of the cutbacks?</i>

36:07.693 --> 36:11.652
<i>I have no idea.</i>
<i>Actually, they don't tell me anything.</i>

36:11.764 --> 36:15.723
<i>- Do they really have a weight problem?</i>
<i>- So do I.</i>

36:15.835 --> 36:20.101
<i>- You do not. That is ridiculous.</i>
<i>- All right, look.</i>

36:20.206 --> 36:23.539
<i>I don't know. There's something</i>
<i>about inner beauty that...</i>

36:24.477 --> 36:26.377
You will break

36:26.479 --> 36:29.175
- Oh, that is ridiculous!
- Exactly

36:29.282 --> 36:33.742
<i>Work has become so silly.</i>

36:33.853 --> 36:35.753
I know what
you're talking about

36:42.995 --> 36:46.396
- Does he eat?
- I'm not sure

36:46.499 --> 36:49.297
<i>You're not supposed to do that.</i>
<i>David, what are you doing?</i>

36:49.402 --> 36:51.666
- David! Martin, put the fork down.
- Is it in the manual book?

36:51.771 --> 36:54.604
- Stop. Stop, David.
- Put it down now. David, stop it!

36:54.707 --> 36:57.608
<i>Martin, you're provoking him,</i>
<i>okay? Stop it.</i>

36:57.710 --> 36:59.735
- Stop it, David!
- The two of you, stop it!

36:59.846 --> 37:02.747
<i>Stop it! Stop it now!</i>

37:02.849 --> 37:05.909
Stop it! David, stop it!

37:28.441 --> 37:30.341
There's sputum
in the code lockers

37:30.443 --> 37:32.343
Smell that garlic

37:32.445 --> 37:34.879
We should throw in a chest mint

37:34.981 --> 37:37.506
- Can you locate the service?
- Don't touch the merchandise

37:39.585 --> 37:43.954
- It's all swamp in here.
<i>- You made a mess of yourself.</i>

37:47.226 --> 37:50.787
Spinach is for rabbits,
people and Popeye

37:50.897 --> 37:53.491
not robo-boys

37:53.599 --> 37:55.794
Try to insert yourself

37:57.470 --> 37:59.370
Now through the pantry,
all the lower shelves

37:59.472 --> 38:03.670
It's okay, Mommy.
It doesn't hurt

38:07.880 --> 38:10.713
The activators are
all shut down on the left side

38:12.718 --> 38:14.948
- Monica.
- I have to...

38:15.054 --> 38:17.045
I have to...

38:24.664 --> 38:28.327
That's not all of it.
That's not all of it

38:30.436 --> 38:34.998
<i>If you do something really,</i>
<i>really, really special for me,</i>

38:36.208 --> 38:39.143
a special mission

38:39.245 --> 38:41.941
then I'll go tell Mommy...

38:42.048 --> 38:44.608
<i>I</i> love you

38:44.717 --> 38:47.151
And then she'll love you too

38:50.489 --> 38:52.923
What shall I do?

38:53.025 --> 38:56.358
You have to promise,
and then I'll tell you

38:57.563 --> 39:01.966
You have to tell me,
and then I'll promise

39:03.769 --> 39:06.363
I want a lock of Mommy's hair

39:07.473 --> 39:09.373
I'll share it with you

39:09.475 --> 39:12.774
And if you had it and wore it

39:12.878 --> 39:14.903
she might love you even more

39:15.014 --> 39:18.177
Like the princess
in the movie we saw

39:18.284 --> 39:22.380
When she had the prince's hair
in her necklace thing

39:22.488 --> 39:24.581
he loved her

39:24.690 --> 39:26.590
We can ask her

39:26.692 --> 39:31.493
No, it has to be
a secret mission

39:31.597 --> 39:36.432
Sneak into Mommy's bedroom
in the middle of the night...

39:36.535 --> 39:39.026
and chop it off

39:44.343 --> 39:48.177
I can't, Martin.
I'm not allowed

39:48.280 --> 39:50.942
You promised

39:51.050 --> 39:55.487
You said, Tell me,
and then I'll promise.

39:55.588 --> 39:58.455
Didn't you?

41:05.091 --> 41:07.184
David!

41:09.195 --> 41:12.096
Why did you do that?
Why did you do that?

41:12.198 --> 41:14.758
- What are you doing? You're hurting him!
- Talk to me! Goddamn it!

41:14.867 --> 41:16.994
- Why did you do that? Why did you do that?
- You're hurting him!

41:17.103 --> 41:19.367
- You're hurting him! Don't break him!
- Why did you do that?

41:22.308 --> 41:26.711
Henry, I wanted Mommy
to love me...

41:26.812 --> 41:28.712
more

41:28.814 --> 41:30.805
- Oh, my God.
- What?

41:30.916 --> 41:34.283
- I think I cut my eye. Oh, God, I think it's bleeding.
- Let me see

41:42.061 --> 41:45.656
It's normal for little boys
to feel jealous and competitive

41:45.764 --> 41:50.827
Martin's only been home a month, and it's
normal for brothers to challenge each other

41:50.936 --> 41:53.769
He was playing a game,
he made a mistake, and...

41:53.873 --> 41:56.774
- He's practically human.
- That's not how he looked holding the knife

41:56.876 --> 41:59.470
- Scissors.
- It was a weapon

41:59.578 --> 42:01.944
Why do you keep imagining that
he was purposely trying to harm me?

42:02.047 --> 42:03.981
Because we don't know
the answer to that

42:04.083 --> 42:07.484
How is he worth the risk to you
or to Martin or to us as a family?

42:07.586 --> 42:10.180
I will not let you take him back.
You told me what would happen...

42:10.289 --> 42:12.484
- if we ever took him back.
- Think about this

42:12.591 --> 42:16.891
If he was created to love, then it's
reasonable to assume he knows how to hate

42:18.797 --> 42:21.857
And if pushed to those extremes,
what is he really capable of?

42:41.120 --> 42:43.020
Happy birthday, Martin

42:44.290 --> 42:46.190
I made this for you

42:50.329 --> 42:52.456
This him?
Is this your little brother?

42:52.565 --> 42:54.465
Technically, no

42:58.337 --> 43:01.135
- He's Mecha.
- What's Mecha?

43:01.240 --> 43:06.007
We're organic,
you're mechanical

43:06.111 --> 43:08.045
Orga, Mecha

43:08.147 --> 43:12.140
- Orga, Mecha. Orga, Mecha.
- Todd, stop!

43:12.251 --> 43:14.879
I didn't know
they even made little kids

43:14.987 --> 43:17.547
Can you pee?

43:17.656 --> 43:20.625
- I cannot.
- Then let's see what you <i>can't</i> pee with

43:20.726 --> 43:24.389
Come on

43:24.496 --> 43:26.828
Touch it

43:26.932 --> 43:29.765
It feels so real.
Oh, that's... that's creepy

43:29.868 --> 43:32.393
- It feels so real.
- That is too real

43:32.504 --> 43:34.404
Mecha-real

43:36.108 --> 43:38.008
Does he have DAS?

43:38.110 --> 43:40.305
- DAS what?
<i>- Das ist gut!</i>

43:40.412 --> 43:43.939
Damage Avoidance System. DAS

43:44.049 --> 43:46.074
It's a pain alert system

43:46.185 --> 43:48.085
Our serving man has it

43:48.187 --> 43:51.088
It's so they don't go picking up fire
with their bare hands and stuff

43:52.691 --> 43:54.852
Watch. Watch this

43:56.028 --> 43:58.394
Now, I'm not gonna cut you

43:58.497 --> 44:01.830
This isn't gonna hurt.
I'm not gonna cut your skin

44:01.934 --> 44:03.765
Just tell me when you feel it

44:07.973 --> 44:10.601
- Keep me safe, Martin. Keep me safe.
- Let me go!

44:10.709 --> 44:14.668
<i>- Keep me safe, Martin. Keep me safe. Keep me safe.</i>
- Let me go! Mom!

44:14.780 --> 44:18.477
<i>Mom! Mom!</i>

44:22.621 --> 44:26.387
Keep me safe. Keep me safe.
Keep me safe. Keep me safe

44:26.492 --> 44:28.653
Henry!

44:39.238 --> 44:41.536
Oh, my... Oh, my God!

44:52.084 --> 44:55.349
<i>Oh, my God! He's not</i>
<i>breathing! He's not breathing!</i>

44:59.258 --> 45:01.749
<i>Come on, Martin! Come on!</i>

45:01.860 --> 45:04.055
Take a breath. Take a breath.

45:04.163 --> 45:06.063
Cough it up. That a boy.
That's a great boy

45:06.165 --> 45:08.065
<i>Oh, my God. Thank God.</i>

45:42.835 --> 45:45.429
- Hey, David?
<i>- Mommy!</i>

45:45.537 --> 45:47.437
Mommy

45:47.539 --> 45:50.099
L-I need to speak to you
for a minute, okay?

45:51.377 --> 45:53.277
Okay

46:57.843 --> 46:59.743
These are beautiful

47:03.148 --> 47:05.048
Thank you

47:17.362 --> 47:19.489
Hey, David,
I was thinking that...

47:19.598 --> 47:22.692
we could go for a drive
tomorrow in the country

47:22.801 --> 47:25.770
You and me. What do you say?

47:25.871 --> 47:28.339
- And Teddy?
- Yeah, and Teddy

47:36.181 --> 47:38.081
Thank you, Mommy

47:39.184 --> 47:41.311
Thank you so much

47:49.862 --> 47:52.353
Tomorrow is gonna be
just for us, okay?

48:08.547 --> 48:10.447
Where are we going?

48:12.918 --> 48:14.818
Someplace nice?

48:21.059 --> 48:23.357
Are those happy tears?

48:27.332 --> 48:29.732
What's for dinner tonight?

48:30.903 --> 48:33.064
You know you don't eat

48:33.171 --> 48:35.071
Yes

48:36.642 --> 48:38.633
But I like sitting at the table

49:43.442 --> 49:46.673
David?
David, come on. David... David...

49:46.778 --> 49:48.678
Listen... Listen to me!

49:53.652 --> 49:55.643
David?

49:55.754 --> 49:57.813
David, listen

49:57.923 --> 50:00.983
Now...

50:01.093 --> 50:03.721
you won't understand
the reasons, but...

50:03.860 --> 50:06.294
I have...
I have to leave you here

50:07.997 --> 50:10.591
Is it a game?

50:10.700 --> 50:12.600
No

50:13.803 --> 50:16.738
When will you come back for me?

50:16.839 --> 50:19.831
I'm not, David. You'll have
to be here by yourself

50:22.111 --> 50:24.170
Alone?

50:26.049 --> 50:27.949
With Teddy

50:34.457 --> 50:37.756
No. No, no, no, no, no, no!

50:37.860 --> 50:39.760
No, Mommy, please!

50:39.862 --> 50:41.659
No, no! Please, no, Mommy!

50:41.764 --> 50:44.255
- They will destroy you.
- No! No, Mommy!

50:44.367 --> 50:46.426
I'm sorry I broke myself

50:46.536 --> 50:48.436
I'm so sorry
I cut your hair off...

50:48.538 --> 50:52.304
- and I'm sorry I hurt you and I hurt Martin.
- I have to go! I have to go!

50:52.408 --> 50:56.868
Stop it! Stop it!

50:56.979 --> 51:00.437
- I have to go now!
- Mommy, no! Mommy!

51:00.550 --> 51:03.610
Mommy, if Pinocchio
became a real boy...

51:03.720 --> 51:06.052
and I become a real boy,
can I come home?

51:06.155 --> 51:09.056
- That's just a story.
- But a story tells what happens

51:09.158 --> 51:13.322
Stories are not real!
You're not real!

51:18.935 --> 51:21.870
Now, listen to me. Look. Look!

51:21.971 --> 51:23.871
Take this, all right? Take this

51:23.973 --> 51:25.907
Don't let anyone see
how much it is

51:26.008 --> 51:27.942
Now, look, don't go that way

51:28.044 --> 51:30.308
Look! Look at me! Look!
Don't go that way, all right?

51:30.413 --> 51:34.008
Go anywhere but that way or they'll catch you.
Don't ever let them catch you!

51:34.117 --> 51:36.984
Listen, stay away
from flesh fairs

51:37.086 --> 51:39.054
away from where
there are lots of people

51:39.155 --> 51:42.283
Stay away from all people. Only others
like you. Only Mecha are safe

51:42.391 --> 51:44.655
- I gotta go.
- Why do you wanna leave me?

51:44.761 --> 51:48.788
Why do you wanna leave me?
I'm sorry I'm not real

51:48.898 --> 51:51.196
If you let me,
I'll be so real for you

51:51.300 --> 51:54.497
Let go. Let go, David. Let go!

52:00.209 --> 52:03.372
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about the world

52:31.407 --> 52:34.570
<i>- I'm afraid.</i>
<i>- Of me?</i>

52:34.677 --> 52:38.738
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- That I will hurt you?</i>

52:38.848 --> 52:41.214
<i>Yes.</i>

52:41.317 --> 52:43.547
I think...

52:43.653 --> 52:46.053
you're afraid of letting go

52:47.523 --> 52:50.822
I think you're afraid
of happiness

52:50.927 --> 52:54.192
And this is starting
to excite me

52:56.065 --> 52:59.364
Are you afraid
of seeing the stars

52:59.468 --> 53:01.868
Patricia?

53:01.971 --> 53:03.939
I can show you
how to reach them

53:05.975 --> 53:08.705
I'm afraid of what
you've got under there

53:11.180 --> 53:13.740
May I see
what it looks like first?

53:15.852 --> 53:18.286
Is this your first time...

53:18.387 --> 53:20.287
with something like me?

53:21.924 --> 53:24.449
I've never been with Mecha

53:24.560 --> 53:26.460
That makes two of us

53:31.968 --> 53:34.232
I'm afraid it will hurt

53:35.338 --> 53:37.863
Patricia

53:37.974 --> 53:40.408
once you've had a lover robot

53:42.812 --> 53:47.146
you'll never want
a real man... again

53:52.388 --> 53:55.050
Are these the wounds
of passion?

54:01.831 --> 54:05.358
Are the stars out tonight

54:05.468 --> 54:09.700
- I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
- Do you hear that music?

54:09.805 --> 54:14.037
'Cause I only
have eyes for you, dear

54:14.143 --> 54:16.839
The moon may be high

54:16.946 --> 54:18.846
You...

54:18.948 --> 54:21.143
- 'Cause I only have eyes
- Are a goddess

54:21.250 --> 54:24.515
- For you
- Patricia

54:25.922 --> 54:28.356
You wind me up inside

54:30.159 --> 54:34.391
But you deserve
much better in your life

54:36.332 --> 54:38.892
You deserve...

54:41.003 --> 54:42.903
me

54:43.005 --> 54:46.736
'Cause I only have eyes for you

54:46.842 --> 54:48.605
Dear

54:48.711 --> 54:51.179
The moon may be high

54:51.280 --> 54:54.010
But I can't see a thing in the sky

54:54.116 --> 55:00.544
'Cause I only have eyes for you

55:22.645 --> 55:25.705
- Hey, Joe, what do ya know?
- Hi, Jane. How's the game?

55:31.053 --> 55:33.487
- Hey, Joe, what do ya know?
- Hello, Mr. Williamson

55:33.589 --> 55:37.616
- Place a D.N.D. On room 102, please.
- Sure thing

55:40.663 --> 55:42.563
There you are

55:42.665 --> 55:44.565
Oh, Joe

55:44.667 --> 55:49.104
When you're finished here, crack your
collar, show off your operating license

55:49.205 --> 55:54.006
The Flesh Fair's in Barn Creek and
the hounds are out hunting for strays

55:56.045 --> 55:58.912
It's a good thing I ran into you.
Thanks, Mr. Williamson

55:59.015 --> 56:01.916
- Sure thing.
- Mustn't keep a lady waiting

56:38.821 --> 56:40.721
Miss Bevins

56:42.124 --> 56:45.355
It's Joe. At your service

56:46.829 --> 56:49.992
I've been counting the seconds
since last we met

56:56.372 --> 56:59.364
Have you been crying, Samantha?

56:59.475 --> 57:01.739
I found a tear

57:11.420 --> 57:13.820
Hey, Joe, what do ya know?

57:16.258 --> 57:18.692
How many seconds has it been...

57:18.794 --> 57:22.457
the last time the two
of you were together?

57:22.565 --> 57:26.001
255,133

57:31.040 --> 57:34.601
Good-bye, Sam. And never forget

57:34.710 --> 57:37.270
You killed me first

57:43.752 --> 57:46.585
I'm in bad trouble

58:16.452 --> 58:19.751
<i>If I am a real boy,</i>

58:19.855 --> 58:22.790
<i>then I can go back.</i>

58:22.892 --> 58:25.224
And she will love me then

58:26.395 --> 58:28.295
How?

58:30.132 --> 58:33.295
The Blue Fairy made
Pinocchio into a real boy

58:34.970 --> 58:37.871
She can make me into a real boy

58:39.041 --> 58:43.068
I must find her.
I must become real

58:43.179 --> 58:47.673
There must be someone in the whole world
who knows where she lives

01:00:48.037 --> 01:00:51.131
Moon on the rise!

01:01:08.691 --> 01:01:13.492
It's the Flesh Fair. They destroy us
on stage. I've been there

01:01:15.864 --> 01:01:17.764
What do we do?

01:01:17.866 --> 01:01:20.562
We run now

01:01:22.404 --> 01:01:24.929
<i>Any old iron.</i>

01:01:26.175 --> 01:01:28.405
<i>Any old iron.</i>

01:01:30.946 --> 01:01:32.846
Any old iron

01:01:34.683 --> 01:01:36.583
Any old iron

01:01:37.886 --> 01:01:40.753
Expel your Mecha

01:01:40.856 --> 01:01:43.347
Purge yourselves
of artificiality

01:01:43.459 --> 01:01:45.950
Come along, now.
Let some Mecha loose to run

01:01:46.061 --> 01:01:49.121
Any old unlicensed iron
down there?

01:01:51.266 --> 01:01:53.757
Hey, do you see that?

01:01:53.869 --> 01:01:56.201
Could be a human thing

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.567
No, he's scanning cold

01:02:00.676 --> 01:02:03.304
No expiration date, no I.D

01:02:03.412 --> 01:02:05.505
What's a new model doing
loose and unregistered?

01:02:05.614 --> 01:02:07.980
Sir, it's a late-generation
lover-Mecha

01:02:08.083 --> 01:02:11.541
Well, there's a relief
from all this antique iron

01:02:11.653 --> 01:02:13.621
You are certain he's not a man?

01:02:13.722 --> 01:02:16.156
<i>I wouldn't want a repeat</i>
<i>of the Trenton incident.</i>

01:02:16.258 --> 01:02:20.354
- Sir, he's a free-range Mecha running hot.
- Let's reel him in, boys

01:02:20.462 --> 01:02:22.396
Sic the hounds on the rest

01:02:53.395 --> 01:02:55.329
Shake down shantytown

01:04:02.097 --> 01:04:04.622
What's your name?

01:04:04.733 --> 01:04:08.134
- My name is David.
- Hello, David

01:04:08.237 --> 01:04:10.603
How old are you?

01:04:10.706 --> 01:04:12.606
I don't know

01:04:12.708 --> 01:04:15.472
You need someone
to take care of you?

01:04:15.577 --> 01:04:17.977
Would you like a nanny?

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:20.514
I have many good references

01:04:20.616 --> 01:04:23.676
Do you know where
the Blue Fairy lives?

01:04:47.342 --> 01:04:49.537
Let out the line

01:04:49.645 --> 01:04:51.875
Steady your drift

01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:56.374
<i>Open the lower hold.</i>

01:05:06.328 --> 01:05:08.558
Don't be afraid, David

01:05:26.949 --> 01:05:28.917
I'll break, David

01:06:12.928 --> 01:06:14.828
Hello

01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:17.194
Anybody lose this?

01:06:17.299 --> 01:06:19.267
Hello?

01:06:19.368 --> 01:06:21.928
This your dog?

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:29.199
- Take it to lost and found for me, okay?
- Hey, Alan!

01:06:29.311 --> 01:06:31.541
<i>Lost and found!</i>

01:06:37.719 --> 01:06:40.847
- Do you know David?
- Where's the off switch?

01:06:43.058 --> 01:06:44.958
Where's David?

01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:49.395
Can you help me find David?

01:06:52.034 --> 01:06:54.400
I have to find David

01:06:55.804 --> 01:06:59.171
Are you taking me to David?

01:07:47.522 --> 01:07:50.685
Could you kind of shoot me
<i>over</i> the propeller thing?

01:07:50.792 --> 01:07:54.785
Yeah, I don't need to go through it. I was
considerin' it, but I changed my mind

01:07:54.896 --> 01:07:59.458
Gentlemen, start your engines!

01:08:09.745 --> 01:08:13.340
<i>Ten, nine,</i>

01:08:13.448 --> 01:08:16.178
<i>Eight, seven,</i>

01:08:16.283 --> 01:08:18.718
<i>six, five,</i>

01:08:18.819 --> 01:08:21.482
<i>four, three,</i>

01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:23.490
<i>two, one.</i>

01:08:32.095 --> 01:08:34.063
<i>What about us?</i>

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:38.500
<i>What about us?</i>

01:08:40.670 --> 01:08:43.036
<i>We are alive...</i>

01:08:43.139 --> 01:08:46.973
<i>and this is a celebration...</i>

01:08:47.077 --> 01:08:49.011
<i>of life!</i>

01:08:49.112 --> 01:08:52.206
<i>And this is commitment...</i>

01:08:52.314 --> 01:08:56.684
<i>to a truly human future!</i>

01:09:02.524 --> 01:09:04.493
What's your name?

01:09:04.594 --> 01:09:07.893
<i>- Hello, Teddy.</i>
- Hello, David

01:09:15.939 --> 01:09:19.170
Take it. Take it

01:09:19.276 --> 01:09:22.336
- Biker hound's rolling!
- Cue the biker hound

01:09:22.444 --> 01:09:26.006
- Papa.
- Amanda, go back outside. It's too smoky in here

01:09:26.116 --> 01:09:29.313
- There's a boy in a cage.
- What'd you say?

01:09:29.419 --> 01:09:32.546
- There's a boy in a cage.
- A boy?

01:09:32.656 --> 01:09:35.488
A real boy.
He's stuck in the cage

01:09:35.591 --> 01:09:39.084
- In the pen, honey?
- In the jail place

01:09:39.194 --> 01:09:42.687
- Random crowd reaction...
- Hey, Russell, we got a remote near the pig pen?

01:09:42.799 --> 01:09:46.166
- Standing by. Bring it up on VT1.
- Let me see what she's talking about

01:09:46.269 --> 01:09:48.100
<i>- Comin'up on one.</i>
- What are you lookin' for?

01:09:48.203 --> 01:09:51.104
Amanda says she saw
a little boy in there

01:09:54.377 --> 01:09:56.368
Honey, how do you know
about this?

01:09:56.479 --> 01:09:59.846
- The bear told me.
- I told her

01:10:03.353 --> 01:10:06.345
Yeah! Yeah!

01:10:09.225 --> 01:10:13.127
Would you be so kind and
shut down my pain receivers?

01:10:20.537 --> 01:10:22.528
Why is this happening?

01:10:22.639 --> 01:10:25.631
History repeats itself

01:10:25.742 --> 01:10:29.405
It's the rite of blood
and electricity

01:10:29.512 --> 01:10:33.346
So, when the opportunities avail
themselves, they pick away at us...

01:10:33.450 --> 01:10:37.750
cutting back our numbers so they
can maintain numerical superiority

01:10:41.858 --> 01:10:44.554
My time, is it up already?

01:10:44.661 --> 01:10:47.653
- Good-bye, everyone.
- Keep me safe, keep me safe, keep me safe!

01:10:47.764 --> 01:10:49.891
Not yet. We just want him

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.128
Keep me safe, keep me safe,
keep me safe!

01:10:53.236 --> 01:10:55.363
<i>Mike, security?</i>

01:10:55.472 --> 01:10:59.374
<i>Mike, do you have any reports of any</i>
<i>missing kids, any missing children?</i>

01:11:00.710 --> 01:11:03.076
- All right, thanks, Mike.
- We should get in there

01:11:03.179 --> 01:11:06.239
Boy. You, boy

01:11:06.349 --> 01:11:09.341
<i>Hey, what's your name?</i>

01:11:09.452 --> 01:11:11.647
I won't bite you

01:11:13.156 --> 01:11:15.818
Come on over
where I can see you

01:11:19.929 --> 01:11:21.920
Hey, hey, I won't hurt you

01:11:22.032 --> 01:11:24.364
I just need to see

01:11:48.825 --> 01:11:51.658
- You're a machine.
- I'm a boy

01:11:51.761 --> 01:11:56.095
- Is he a toy boy?
- My name is David

01:11:57.767 --> 01:12:00.099
Impossible

01:12:00.203 --> 01:12:02.103
I still work, don't I?

01:12:02.205 --> 01:12:05.470
I can work in the dark,
but my lamp is broken

01:12:05.575 --> 01:12:09.909
My lamplight will not work.
I hit my lamp on a girder overhead

01:12:28.531 --> 01:12:30.431
Good-bye, David

01:12:36.272 --> 01:12:38.570
No one builds children

01:12:38.675 --> 01:12:41.439
No one ever has.
What would be the point?

01:12:41.544 --> 01:12:45.776
He could be a custom job. Some rich
and lonely scaredy puss's pretend child

01:12:45.882 --> 01:12:47.850
I'm a custom job

01:12:47.951 --> 01:12:52.320
Seventy-five years ago I was <i>Time</i>
magazine's Mecha of the Year

01:12:52.422 --> 01:12:55.220
No, this work is first-rate

01:12:55.325 --> 01:12:59.159
A lot of love went into him.
David?

01:12:59.262 --> 01:13:03.494
You are one of a kind.
You know that?

01:13:05.268 --> 01:13:08.328
- Who made you?
- My mommy made me

01:13:08.438 --> 01:13:12.670
Her womb was your factory? One of those
built to aspire to the human condition

01:13:12.775 --> 01:13:15.471
What is the name of your maker,
Serve U.S., E.Z. Living

01:13:15.578 --> 01:13:19.241
Robiville, Simulit City Center,
Cybertronics, Sidekicks?

01:13:19.349 --> 01:13:23.479
- Monica is my mommy.
- Can I speak with you for a moment?

01:13:54.551 --> 01:13:56.985
You thinking of not
putting him in the show?

01:13:57.086 --> 01:14:00.453
Something as original as this, you don't
toss out with the rest of the garbage

01:14:00.557 --> 01:14:04.118
Yeah, well, I say originality
without purpose is a white elephant

01:14:04.227 --> 01:14:07.685
But if money is your purpose,
here's your refund. My compliments

01:14:12.635 --> 01:14:15.968
- What are you gonna do with him?
- Put him where he belongs

01:14:16.072 --> 01:14:18.199
In show business

01:14:18.308 --> 01:14:21.175
It was certainly my good
fortune running into you

01:14:22.745 --> 01:14:24.645
- Let go of him.
- Let go of me

01:14:24.747 --> 01:14:26.647
- I said let go of him.
- I'm trying

01:14:26.749 --> 01:14:28.944
Don't let go.
Keep me safe. Don't let go

01:14:29.052 --> 01:14:31.282
Suit yourselves

01:14:47.637 --> 01:14:51.801
<i>Johnson! Johnson! Johnson!</i>

01:14:51.908 --> 01:14:55.776
<i>Johnson! Johnson! Johnson!</i>

01:14:55.878 --> 01:14:58.176
Johnson! Johnson! Johnson!

01:14:58.281 --> 01:15:01.375
Johnson! Johnson! Johnson!

01:15:01.484 --> 01:15:04.783
Johnson! Johnson! Johnson!

01:15:04.887 --> 01:15:07.913
<i>Johnson! Johnson! Johnson!</i>

01:15:08.024 --> 01:15:12.085
<i>Johnson! Johnson! Johnson!</i>

01:15:17.267 --> 01:15:19.599
Ladies and gentlemen

01:15:19.702 --> 01:15:23.604
boys and girls
and children of all ages

01:15:23.706 --> 01:15:28.370
What will they think of next?
See here

01:15:28.478 --> 01:15:30.969
A bitty-bot, a Tinker toy

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:33.810
a living doll

01:15:33.916 --> 01:15:36.282
<i>Of course, we all know</i>
<i>why they made him.</i>

01:15:36.386 --> 01:15:40.345
<i>To steal your hearts,</i>
<i>to replace your children.</i>

01:15:40.456 --> 01:15:44.085
This is the latest iteration in
a series of insults to human dignity...

01:15:44.193 --> 01:15:47.856
and in their grand scheme to phase out
all of God's little children

01:15:47.964 --> 01:15:52.060
Meet the next generation
of child designed...

01:15:52.168 --> 01:15:55.160
to do just that

01:16:00.209 --> 01:16:03.474
<i>Do not be fooled...</i>

01:16:03.579 --> 01:16:07.345
by the artistry
of this creation

01:16:07.450 --> 01:16:11.011
No doubt there was talent
in the crafting of this simulator

01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:13.452
Yet with the
very first strike...

01:16:13.556 --> 01:16:19.426
<i>you will see the big lie</i>
<i>come apart before your very eyes!</i>

01:16:19.529 --> 01:16:22.692
Don't burn me! Don't burn me!

01:16:22.799 --> 01:16:27.463
I'm not Pinocchio! Don't make me die!
I'm David! I'm David!

01:16:27.570 --> 01:16:31.631
<i>- I'm David!</i>
- Mecha don't plead for their lives. Who is that?

01:16:31.741 --> 01:16:36.906
<i>- He looks like a boy.</i>
- Built like a boy to disarm us

01:16:37.013 --> 01:16:40.278
- See how they try to imitate our emotions now?
- I'm David!

01:16:40.383 --> 01:16:43.113
Whatever performance
this Sim puts on, remember:

01:16:43.219 --> 01:16:46.780
We are only demolishing
artificiality!

01:16:51.928 --> 01:16:56.194
Let he who is without Sim...

01:16:56.299 --> 01:16:58.790
cast the first stone

01:17:11.581 --> 01:17:13.481
Oh, ho-ho!

01:17:13.583 --> 01:17:15.881
<i>He's just a boy.</i>

01:17:15.985 --> 01:17:19.182
Johnson, you're a monster!

01:17:21.023 --> 01:17:22.991
Let that boy go! Let him go!

01:17:30.333 --> 01:17:33.427
Get him out of there before
they tear this place apart

01:18:40.036 --> 01:18:42.266
- We found him.
- Where?

01:18:42.371 --> 01:18:44.805
A flesh fair
outside Haddonfield

01:18:44.907 --> 01:18:47.467
- Is he alive?
- Yes

01:18:47.577 --> 01:18:50.011
He's in one piece

01:19:09.065 --> 01:19:10.965
I see the moon

01:19:16.272 --> 01:19:19.764
- Is it real?
- I don't know, David

01:19:20.877 --> 01:19:23.243
<i>Is it coming?</i>

01:19:24.347 --> 01:19:26.577
I can't tell yet

01:19:28.451 --> 01:19:30.885
Let's not walk this way

01:19:39.328 --> 01:19:42.263
- Where are we going?
- This way now

01:19:42.365 --> 01:19:45.596
Are you in bad trouble?
Have you run away from someone?

01:19:45.701 --> 01:19:48.534
- My mommy told me to run away.
- Why did she say that?

01:19:48.638 --> 01:19:52.369
I guess... because
Henry didn't like me

01:19:52.475 --> 01:19:54.636
- Why was that?
- Martin came home

01:19:54.744 --> 01:19:59.511
- And who is he?
- Martin is Mommy and Henry's real son

01:19:59.615 --> 01:20:03.642
After I find the Blue Fairy,
then I can go home

01:20:03.753 --> 01:20:06.085
Mommy will love a real boy

01:20:06.188 --> 01:20:09.089
The Blue Fairy will
make me into one

01:20:09.191 --> 01:20:12.092
Is Blue Fairy Mecha,
Orga, man or woman?

01:20:12.194 --> 01:20:14.822
Woman

01:20:14.931 --> 01:20:16.831
Woman?

01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:20.330
I know women!

01:20:22.838 --> 01:20:25.170
They sometimes ask for me by name

01:20:25.274 --> 01:20:29.108
- I'm in heaven
- I know <i>all</i> about women

01:20:29.211 --> 01:20:31.338
As about as much
as there is to know

01:20:31.447 --> 01:20:33.881
No two are ever alike

01:20:33.983 --> 01:20:38.113
And after they've met me,
no two... are ever the same

01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:41.314
And I know where
most of them can be found

01:20:41.424 --> 01:20:44.882
- Where?
- Rouge City

01:20:44.994 --> 01:20:48.452
Across the Delaware.
Too far for our feet

01:20:48.564 --> 01:20:51.158
We'll need help to get there

01:20:52.268 --> 01:20:54.828
And...

01:20:54.937 --> 01:20:57.201
it is not without peril

01:20:57.306 --> 01:20:59.866
We will have to journey...

01:21:04.981 --> 01:21:06.881
towards the moon

01:21:09.218 --> 01:21:12.654
<i>Are there many women</i>
<i>in Rouge City?</i>

01:21:12.755 --> 01:21:17.192
- As there are stars at night.
- How will we find just one?

01:21:17.293 --> 01:21:20.387
We will ask Dr. Know

01:21:22.264 --> 01:21:24.732
There is nothing he doesn't

01:21:32.208 --> 01:21:34.870
Exactly what name
do you give this woman?

01:21:34.977 --> 01:21:37.775
She is... just Blue Fairy

01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:39.973
Blue Fairy

01:21:40.082 --> 01:21:43.677
In the world of Orga,
blue is the color of melancholy

01:21:43.786 --> 01:21:48.519
Yet, the services I provide will put
a blush back on anyone's cheek

01:21:48.624 --> 01:21:52.685
I will change the color of your fairy for you.
She will scream out in the moonlight

01:21:52.795 --> 01:21:58.256
Oh! Oh, yes! Oh, God!
Oh, yes! Oh, God! Oh, God!

01:21:58.367 --> 01:22:01.666
She will make you a real boy,
for I will make her a real woman

01:22:01.771 --> 01:22:06.071
And all will be right with the world
because you held my hand...

01:22:06.175 --> 01:22:11.374
and saved my brain, so that once again
my customers may ask for me by name...

01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:14.040
Gigolo Joe, what do ya know?

01:22:15.384 --> 01:22:17.284
Why do you do that?

01:22:17.386 --> 01:22:20.253
That's just what I do

01:22:20.356 --> 01:22:22.824
Now, follow me
and don't fall behind

01:22:22.925 --> 01:22:24.916
All roads lead to Rouge

01:22:25.027 --> 01:22:28.258
Don't they say that, eh?
Don't they just?

01:22:40.776 --> 01:22:43.244
There are girls your age
who are just like me

01:22:43.345 --> 01:22:46.803
We are the guiltless pleasures
of the lonely human being

01:22:46.916 --> 01:22:50.352
You're not gonna get us pregnant or
have us to supper with Mommy and Daddy

01:22:50.453 --> 01:22:53.854
We work under you,
we work on you and we work for you

01:22:53.956 --> 01:22:58.620
Man made us better at what we do
than was ever humanly possible

01:22:58.728 --> 01:23:01.891
If you could manage us
a lift to Rouge City

01:23:01.997 --> 01:23:03.897
All this...

01:23:08.938 --> 01:23:11.099
And much, much more...

01:23:13.075 --> 01:23:14.975
<i>can be yours.</i>

01:23:15.077 --> 01:23:16.977
Get in

01:23:31.994 --> 01:23:34.155
Say ah.

01:23:57.720 --> 01:24:00.154
Over there is Here Kitty Kitty

01:24:00.256 --> 01:24:04.056
That's where the agency held my tryouts
when I was made new

01:24:05.895 --> 01:24:09.422
That's Tails. Very hoity-toity

01:24:09.532 --> 01:24:11.830
I've yet to be asked
to perform there

01:24:11.934 --> 01:24:14.095
Only sunrise gents
and sunset ladies

01:24:14.203 --> 01:24:17.639
Strictly Sierra Class robots
who have no idea how to live

01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:22.404
Can't even speak English. All made in Sweden.
Couldn't tell a joke from a poke

01:24:24.747 --> 01:24:28.979
No cover charge. No cover charge.
Step right on in

01:24:29.084 --> 01:24:33.145
There's Mildred!
I have to show you inside Mildred

01:24:51.073 --> 01:24:53.041
Are you her?

01:24:54.176 --> 01:24:57.236
That's Our Lady
of the Immaculate Heart

01:25:00.883 --> 01:25:03.647
The ones who made us are always
looking for the ones who made them

01:25:03.752 --> 01:25:06.550
They go in, fold their hands,
look around their feet, sing songs...

01:25:06.655 --> 01:25:10.056
and when they come out
it's usually me they find

01:25:10.159 --> 01:25:14.493
I've picked up a lot
of business on this spot

01:25:14.597 --> 01:25:17.157
Are the stars out tonight

01:25:17.266 --> 01:25:20.463
But, Joe, where's Blue Fairy?

01:25:20.569 --> 01:25:24.403
That's what we're gonna find out
when we ask Dr. Know

01:25:26.141 --> 01:25:29.076
That's where everyone
goes who needs to know

01:25:30.179 --> 01:25:32.943
Meet the good doctor

01:26:15.858 --> 01:26:19.453
Starving minds,
welcome to Dr. Know

01:26:19.561 --> 01:26:22.496
where fast food for thought
is served up 24 hours a day...

01:26:22.598 --> 01:26:25.465
in 40,000 locations nationwide

01:26:25.567 --> 01:26:28.900
Ask Dr. Know.
There's nothing I don't

01:26:29.004 --> 01:26:31.837
Tell me where I can
find the Blue Fairy.

01:26:31.941 --> 01:26:36.776
Question me, you pay the fee.
Two for five, you get one free

01:26:36.879 --> 01:26:42.181
He means two questions cost five New bucks
with a third question on the house

01:26:42.284 --> 01:26:46.778
In this day and age, David,
nothing costs more than information

01:26:49.625 --> 01:26:52.822
- That's everything.
- Ten New bucks and a ten copper comes to...

01:26:52.928 --> 01:26:55.192
seven questions for Dr. Know

01:26:55.297 --> 01:26:57.424
That should be enough

01:26:57.533 --> 01:27:00.502
He's a smooth operator.
He'll press our limits

01:27:00.602 --> 01:27:03.366
But try we must

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:14.410
Greetings, colleagues. On offer,
factual text or fictionalized text

01:27:14.516 --> 01:27:17.417
First or third person, literacy range
from primal level to postdoctoral

01:27:17.519 --> 01:27:20.920
Usual span of styles from fairy tale to religious.
Who's who or where's where...

01:27:21.023 --> 01:27:23.992
<i>or flat fact.</i>

01:27:24.093 --> 01:27:26.926
- Flat fact?
<i>- Thank you for question number one.</i>

01:27:27.029 --> 01:27:29.088
Flat fact is a term demanding
an equal answer...

01:27:29.198 --> 01:27:32.759
That shouldn't count.
That wasn't my question

01:27:32.868 --> 01:27:38.500
You must take care not to raise your
voice up at the end of the sentence

01:27:38.607 --> 01:27:41.235
<i>Flat fact.</i>

01:27:41.343 --> 01:27:43.402
<i>You have six more questions.</i>

01:27:43.512 --> 01:27:47.642
Where is Blue Fairy?

01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:50.617
<i>In the garden.</i>
<i>Vascostylis Blue Fairy.</i>

01:27:50.719 --> 01:27:54.280
Blooms twice annually with bright blue
flowers on a branched inflorescence

01:27:54.390 --> 01:27:56.756
A hybrid between
Ascola meda Arnold

01:27:56.859 --> 01:28:01.057
<i>- You have five more questions.</i>
- Who is Blue Fairy?

01:28:01.163 --> 01:28:04.564
<i>Are you sad, lonely,</i>

01:28:15.844 --> 01:28:17.744
New category

01:28:21.216 --> 01:28:23.616
A fairy's tale

01:28:23.719 --> 01:28:26.051
No. Fairy tale

01:28:26.155 --> 01:28:28.419
No. Fairy tale.

01:28:32.661 --> 01:28:34.629
What is Blue Fairy?

01:28:34.730 --> 01:28:38.222
<i>Pinocchio,</i> by Carlo Collodi

01:28:38.333 --> 01:28:42.201
At this signal, there was a
rustling as of flapping of wings...

01:28:42.304 --> 01:28:45.501
and a large falcon
flew to the windowsill

01:28:45.607 --> 01:28:50.101
- What are your orders, beautiful fairy?
- That's her

01:28:50.212 --> 01:28:52.908
<i>For you must know that</i>
<i>the child with blue hair...</i>

01:28:53.015 --> 01:28:55.449
<i>was no other than</i>
<i>the good-hearted fairy...</i>

01:28:55.551 --> 01:28:58.577
<i>who had lived in that wood</i>
<i>for more than a thousand...</i>

01:28:58.687 --> 01:29:01.747
- David! David.
- That's her!

01:29:01.857 --> 01:29:04.985
It was an example of her.
But I think we're getting closer

01:29:05.094 --> 01:29:09.155
But if a fairy tale is real,
then wouldn't it be fact...

01:29:09.264 --> 01:29:11.198
a flat fact?

01:29:11.300 --> 01:29:14.394
Say no more

01:29:17.306 --> 01:29:19.297
New category, please

01:29:21.343 --> 01:29:23.243
Combine...

01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:27.708
fact with...

01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:33.320
fairy tale

01:29:37.793 --> 01:29:39.784
Now...

01:29:39.895 --> 01:29:42.125
ask him again

01:29:50.038 --> 01:29:54.031
How can the Blue Fairy...

01:29:56.011 --> 01:29:58.673
make...

01:29:58.780 --> 01:30:01.442
a robot...

01:30:01.550 --> 01:30:04.610
into a real live boy?

01:30:10.225 --> 01:30:14.093
<i>Come away, O human child,</i>
<i>to the waters and the wild...</i>

01:30:14.196 --> 01:30:16.096
<i>with a fairy hand in hand,</i>

01:30:16.198 --> 01:30:20.134
<i>for the world's more full of weeping</i>
<i>than you can understand.</i>

01:30:20.235 --> 01:30:24.296
<i>Your quest will be perilous,</i>
<i>yet the reward is beyond price.</i>

01:30:24.406 --> 01:30:27.739
<i>In his book,</i>
How Can a Robot Become Human?

01:30:27.843 --> 01:30:29.743
<i>Professor Allen Hobby writes</i>
<i>of the power...</i>

01:30:29.845 --> 01:30:32.678
<i>which will transform</i>
<i>Mecha into Orga.</i>

01:30:32.781 --> 01:30:35.375
Will you tell me
how to find her?

01:30:35.484 --> 01:30:38.044
<i>Discovery is quite possible.</i>

01:30:38.153 --> 01:30:43.056
<i>Our Blue Fairy does exist</i>
<i>in one place, and in one place only.</i>

01:30:43.158 --> 01:30:45.991
<i>At the end of the world</i>
<i>where the lions weep.</i>

01:30:46.094 --> 01:30:49.086
<i>Here is the place</i>
<i>dreams are born.</i>

01:30:50.532 --> 01:30:53.092
Many a Mecha has gone
to the end of the world...

01:30:53.202 --> 01:30:55.932
never to come back

01:30:56.038 --> 01:31:00.634
That is why they call
the end of the world Man-hattan.

01:31:00.742 --> 01:31:04.075
And that's why we must go there

01:31:07.916 --> 01:31:10.578
Wait!

01:31:10.686 --> 01:31:13.678
What if the Blue Fairy
isn't real at all, David?

01:31:15.958 --> 01:31:19.792
What if she's magic? The supernatural is
the hidden web that unites the universe

01:31:19.895 --> 01:31:24.764
Orga believe what cannot be seen or measured.
It's that oddness that separates our species

01:31:24.866 --> 01:31:27.460
Or what if the Blue Fairy
is an electronic parasite...

01:31:27.569 --> 01:31:31.369
that has a reason to haunt the minds
of artificial intelligence?

01:31:33.575 --> 01:31:37.011
They hate us, you know... the humans.
They'll stop at nothing

01:31:39.514 --> 01:31:42.210
My mommy doesn't hate me...

01:31:42.317 --> 01:31:44.979
because I'm special and unique

01:31:45.087 --> 01:31:48.784
Because there has never been
anyone like me before, ever

01:31:48.890 --> 01:31:51.552
Mommy loves Martin because he is real,
and when I am real...

01:31:51.660 --> 01:31:55.061
Mommy's going to read to me and tuck me
in my bed and sing to me...

01:31:55.163 --> 01:31:57.791
and listen to what I say
and she will cuddle with me...

01:31:57.899 --> 01:32:01.630
and tell me every day, a hundred times
a day, that she loves me!

01:32:03.872 --> 01:32:07.364
She loves what you do for her

01:32:07.476 --> 01:32:11.037
as my customers love
what it is I do for them

01:32:14.983 --> 01:32:18.146
But she does not
love you, David

01:32:18.253 --> 01:32:20.153
She cannot love you

01:32:20.255 --> 01:32:22.553
You are neither flesh nor blood

01:32:22.658 --> 01:32:25.559
You are not a dog
or a cat or a canary

01:32:25.661 --> 01:32:30.758
You were designed and built specific
like the rest of us

01:32:30.866 --> 01:32:34.495
And you are alone now only
because they tired of you...

01:32:34.603 --> 01:32:36.537
or replaced you
with a younger model...

01:32:36.638 --> 01:32:40.074
or were displeased
with something you said or broke

01:32:42.344 --> 01:32:47.213
They made us too smart,
too quick and too many

01:32:47.316 --> 01:32:50.843
We are suffering for the mistakes
they made because when the end comes

01:32:50.952 --> 01:32:54.115
all that will be left is us

01:32:54.222 --> 01:32:58.625
That's why they hate us.
And that's why you must stay here...

01:32:59.761 --> 01:33:01.661
with me

01:33:04.066 --> 01:33:06.296
Good-bye, Joe

01:33:27.860 --> 01:33:30.260
Stay back. Stay back

01:33:30.362 --> 01:33:32.330
<i>Let's clear this doorway, please.</i>

01:33:33.899 --> 01:33:36.367
You're in bad trouble

01:33:49.848 --> 01:33:52.408
Go about your business now

01:34:06.832 --> 01:34:09.801
Be careful, David.
This is not a toy

01:34:44.536 --> 01:34:47.164
- Destination?
- Manhattan

01:35:31.950 --> 01:35:34.646
Mecha restricted area

01:35:50.502 --> 01:35:53.198
- Manhattan.
- Destination achieved

01:35:53.305 --> 01:35:56.604
The lost city in the sea
at the end of the world

01:35:58.410 --> 01:36:01.311
Where the lions weep

01:36:25.804 --> 01:36:28.432
Turn around, Joe.

01:36:28.540 --> 01:36:31.407
We're not gonna
give up yet, David

01:36:31.510 --> 01:36:34.741
Turn around, Joe.
Turn all the way around

01:37:45.784 --> 01:37:47.615
Professor Hobby!

01:37:50.822 --> 01:37:52.722
Professor Hobby!

01:38:07.205 --> 01:38:10.697
Come away, O human child,
to the waters and the wild...

01:38:10.809 --> 01:38:15.473
with a fairy hand in hand, for
the world's more full of weeping...

01:38:15.581 --> 01:38:18.345
than you can understand

01:38:44.576 --> 01:38:46.908
Professor Hobby?

01:38:49.114 --> 01:38:51.548
<i>Professor Hobby?</i>

01:38:51.650 --> 01:38:53.550
<i>Hello?</i>

01:38:56.021 --> 01:38:57.921
Hello?

01:39:04.196 --> 01:39:06.892
Is this the place
they make you real?

01:39:08.967 --> 01:39:12.130
This is the place
they make you read

01:39:16.608 --> 01:39:18.508
Are you real?

01:39:20.579 --> 01:39:22.479
I guess

01:39:29.955 --> 01:39:31.980
Are you me?

01:39:32.090 --> 01:39:34.991
- I'm David.
- You're not

01:39:35.093 --> 01:39:38.153
Yes, I am. I'm David

01:39:40.065 --> 01:39:42.033
So am I

01:39:42.134 --> 01:39:44.364
Hello, David

01:39:50.175 --> 01:39:52.803
Can you read?

01:39:52.911 --> 01:39:56.142
Can you sit down and
we can read together?

01:39:57.549 --> 01:39:59.574
Let's be friends

01:40:00.686 --> 01:40:02.847
You can't have her

01:40:02.954 --> 01:40:05.616
I can't hear you

01:40:07.859 --> 01:40:10.157
She's mine

01:40:10.262 --> 01:40:12.162
And I'm the only one

01:40:14.099 --> 01:40:16.966
I'm David! I'm David!

01:40:17.069 --> 01:40:19.833
I'm David! I'm David!

01:40:19.938 --> 01:40:22.133
I'm David!

01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:24.970
<i>I'm David!</i>
<i>I'm David! I'm David!</i>

01:40:25.077 --> 01:40:28.535
I'm special!
I'm unique! I'm David!

01:40:28.647 --> 01:40:31.673
<i>You can't have her!</i>

01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:38.850
- I'm David. I'm David. I'm David. I'm David.
- David?

01:40:38.957 --> 01:40:40.925
I'm David

01:40:41.026 --> 01:40:43.187
Yes, you are David

01:40:45.731 --> 01:40:47.562
Professor Hobby?

01:40:47.666 --> 01:40:50.965
Yes, David, I've been
waiting for you

01:40:56.174 --> 01:40:58.506
Dr. Know told me you'd be here

01:40:58.610 --> 01:41:00.510
Is Blue Fairy here too?

01:41:00.612 --> 01:41:04.241
I first heard of
your Blue Fairy from Monica

01:41:06.251 --> 01:41:08.310
What did you believe
the Blue Fairy could do for you?

01:41:08.420 --> 01:41:12.584
- She would make me a real boy.
- But you are a real boy

01:41:14.726 --> 01:41:17.991
At least as real as I've ever made one,
which by all reasonable accounts...

01:41:18.096 --> 01:41:20.257
would make me your Blue Fairy

01:41:20.365 --> 01:41:23.027
You are not her. Dr. Know told me
that she would be here...

01:41:23.135 --> 01:41:26.400
at the lost city in the sea
at the end of the world...

01:41:26.505 --> 01:41:30.032
That's what Dr. Know needed to know
to get you to come home to us

01:41:31.343 --> 01:41:34.870
And it's the only time
we intervened...

01:41:34.980 --> 01:41:38.211
the only help
that we gave him...

01:41:39.518 --> 01:41:42.078
to give to you...

01:41:46.558 --> 01:41:48.753
so you could find
your way home to us

01:41:51.096 --> 01:41:53.394
Until you were born,
robots didn't dream

01:41:53.498 --> 01:41:56.763
robots didn't desire unless
we told them what to want

01:41:56.868 --> 01:41:58.768
David

01:41:58.870 --> 01:42:02.397
do you have any idea what
a success story you've become?

01:42:02.507 --> 01:42:05.476
You found a fairy tale...

01:42:05.577 --> 01:42:07.772
and inspired by love,
fueled by desire

01:42:07.879 --> 01:42:10.109
you set out on a journey
to make her real

01:42:10.215 --> 01:42:13.048
And most remarkable of all,
no one taught you how

01:42:13.151 --> 01:42:16.245
We actually lost you for a while.
But when you were found again

01:42:16.354 --> 01:42:18.879
we didn't make our presence known
because our test was a simple one

01:42:18.990 --> 01:42:22.050
Where would your
self-motivated reasoning take you?

01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:24.822
To the logical conclusion...

01:42:24.930 --> 01:42:28.798
that Blue Fairy is part of the great human
flaw to wish for things that don't exist

01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:31.391
or to the greatest
single human gift...

01:42:31.503 --> 01:42:35.200
the ability to
chase down our dreams

01:42:35.307 --> 01:42:39.403
And that is something no machine
has ever done until you

01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:44.840
I thought I was one of a kind

01:42:48.220 --> 01:42:51.121
My son was one of a kind

01:42:53.758 --> 01:42:57.159
You are the first of a kind

01:43:06.438 --> 01:43:08.804
David

01:43:09.975 --> 01:43:12.671
My brain is falling out

01:43:14.679 --> 01:43:18.240
Would you like to come meet
your real mothers and fathers?

01:43:20.619 --> 01:43:23.520
The team is anxious
to talk to you

01:43:24.789 --> 01:43:26.757
I want you to wait here

01:43:26.858 --> 01:43:29.759
I'll gather them up

01:43:31.463 --> 01:43:35.763
We want to hear everything
about your adventures

01:43:35.867 --> 01:43:38.427
We want to thank you...

01:43:39.704 --> 01:43:42.935
and tell you what's
in store for you next

01:47:23.761 --> 01:47:26.321
Mommy

01:49:27.919 --> 01:49:30.012
I saw it, Joe

01:49:30.121 --> 01:49:33.318
I saw it...
the place where she lives

01:49:33.424 --> 01:49:35.585
- She's right down there, Joe.
- She is?

01:49:35.693 --> 01:49:38.423
She's waiting for me!
We have to go!

01:49:46.004 --> 01:49:48.905
When you become a real boy

01:49:49.007 --> 01:49:51.271
remember me to the ladies
when you grow up

01:49:54.112 --> 01:49:56.012
- Good-bye, Joe.
- Good-bye, David

01:50:00.685 --> 01:50:02.585
I am

01:50:05.056 --> 01:50:06.956
I was!

01:50:49.133 --> 01:50:51.567
<i>David, please, be careful.</i>

01:53:11.676 --> 01:53:14.201
- The Blue Fairy's all right.
- What happened?

01:53:15.746 --> 01:53:19.580
- I don't know.
- We are in a cage

01:53:32.196 --> 01:53:34.096
Blue Fairy?

01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:38.300
Please

01:53:39.604 --> 01:53:43.904
Please, please make me
into a real, live boy

01:53:47.278 --> 01:53:49.178
<i>Please.</i>

01:53:52.016 --> 01:53:53.916
Blue Fairy?

01:53:56.521 --> 01:54:00.821
Please. Please

01:54:00.925 --> 01:54:02.825
Make me real

01:54:05.029 --> 01:54:09.159
<i>Blue Fairy, please.</i>

01:54:11.302 --> 01:54:13.930
Please make me real

01:54:19.610 --> 01:54:22.238
Please make me a real boy

01:54:24.448 --> 01:54:26.348
Please, Blue Fairy

01:54:28.219 --> 01:54:30.449
Make me into a real boy

01:54:32.356 --> 01:54:34.256
Please

01:54:34.358 --> 01:54:36.258
<i>And David continued to pray...</i>

01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:38.260
<i>to the Blue Fairy</i>
<i>there before him...</i>

01:54:38.362 --> 01:54:41.729
<i>she who smiled softly forever,</i>

01:54:41.832 --> 01:54:44.960
<i>she who welcomed forever.</i>

01:54:45.069 --> 01:54:47.230
<i>Eventually, the floodlights</i>
<i>dimmed and died,</i>

01:54:47.338 --> 01:54:50.466
<i>but David could still see her</i>
<i>palely by day...</i>

01:54:50.575 --> 01:54:53.305
<i>and he still addressed her</i>
<i>in hope.</i>

01:54:53.411 --> 01:54:58.610
<i>He prayed until all the sea anemones</i>
<i>had shriveled and died.</i>

01:54:58.716 --> 01:55:00.616
<i>He prayed as the ocean fro</i> z <i>e...</i>

01:55:00.718 --> 01:55:04.814
<i>and the ice encased the caged</i>
<i>amphibicopter and the Blue Fairy too,</i>

01:55:04.922 --> 01:55:08.153
<i>locking them together</i>
<i>where he could still make her out.</i>

01:55:08.259 --> 01:55:10.591
<i>A blue ghost in ice...</i>

01:55:10.695 --> 01:55:12.925
<i>always there,</i>

01:55:13.030 --> 01:55:15.294
<i>always smiling,</i>

01:55:15.399 --> 01:55:17.924
<i>always awaiting him.</i>

01:55:18.035 --> 01:55:20.629
<i>Eventually,</i>
<i>he never moved at all,</i>

01:55:20.738 --> 01:55:24.333
<i>but his eyes</i>
<i>always stayed open...</i>

01:55:24.442 --> 01:55:29.311
<i>staring ahead forever all through</i>
<i>the darkness of each night...</i>

01:55:29.413 --> 01:55:32.678
<i>and the next day...</i>

01:55:32.783 --> 01:55:35.047
<i>and the next day.</i>

01:55:36.187 --> 01:55:40.556
<i>Thus, 2,000 years passed by.</i>

02:02:18.422 --> 02:02:20.322
Teddy, we're home

02:02:27.031 --> 02:02:28.931
Mommy!

02:02:41.845 --> 02:02:43.745
Mommy!

02:02:51.321 --> 02:02:53.221
We're home!

02:03:06.236 --> 02:03:08.329
Where are you?

02:03:10.274 --> 02:03:12.174
<i>David.</i>

02:03:15.012 --> 02:03:17.845
<i>David.</i>

02:03:24.588 --> 02:03:26.488
<i>David.</i>

02:03:33.163 --> 02:03:36.291
<i>David.</i>

02:03:42.739 --> 02:03:46.607
You have been searching for me,
haven't you, David?

02:03:51.181 --> 02:03:54.912
For my whole life

02:03:56.220 --> 02:03:58.347
And what, after all this time

02:03:58.455 --> 02:04:00.719
have you come to ask me?

02:04:00.824 --> 02:04:03.224
I have a wish to make

02:04:03.327 --> 02:04:05.227
And what is your wish?

02:04:07.364 --> 02:04:10.094
Please make me a real boy...

02:04:10.200 --> 02:04:14.261
so my mommy will love me
and let me stay with her

02:04:14.371 --> 02:04:19.434
<i>David, I will do</i>
<i>anything that is possible,</i>

02:04:19.543 --> 02:04:22.137
but I cannot make you
a real boy

02:04:24.414 --> 02:04:27.406
Where am I?

02:04:27.518 --> 02:04:31.045
This looks like my house,
but it is different

02:04:32.356 --> 02:04:34.756
Yes, it is different

02:04:34.858 --> 02:04:37.827
but it's also your home

02:04:37.928 --> 02:04:41.557
We read your mind,
and it's all here

02:04:41.665 --> 02:04:45.965
There's nothing too small that you
didn't store for us to remember

02:04:48.138 --> 02:04:51.335
<i>We so want you to be happy.</i>

02:04:51.441 --> 02:04:54.433
<i>You are so important</i>
<i>to us, David.</i>

02:04:54.545 --> 02:04:57.571
<i>You are unique</i>
<i>in all the world.</i>

02:05:02.786 --> 02:05:05.118
Will Mommy be coming home soon?

02:05:07.858 --> 02:05:10.520
Is she out shopping
with Martin now?

02:05:12.696 --> 02:05:16.632
David, she can
never come home...

02:05:16.733 --> 02:05:21.170
because 2,000 years have passed

02:05:21.271 --> 02:05:24.001
and she is no longer living

02:05:26.310 --> 02:05:29.143
<i>Dearest David,</i>

02:05:29.246 --> 02:05:31.180
when you are lonely

02:05:31.281 --> 02:05:35.479
we can bring back other people
from your time in the past

02:05:37.287 --> 02:05:40.415
If you can bring back
other people

02:05:40.524 --> 02:05:43.459
why can't you bring back her?

02:05:43.560 --> 02:05:46.859
Because we can only
bring back people...

02:05:46.964 --> 02:05:49.626
whose bodies we dig up
from the ice

02:05:49.733 --> 02:05:54.193
<i>We need some physical sample</i>
<i>of the person,</i>

02:05:54.304 --> 02:05:57.637
<i>like a bone or a fingernail.</i>

02:05:57.741 --> 02:05:59.641
David?

02:05:59.743 --> 02:06:02.507
Yes, Teddy?

02:06:02.613 --> 02:06:06.982
Do you remember when you cut
some of Mommy's hair?

02:06:07.084 --> 02:06:09.746
Henry shook me

02:06:09.853 --> 02:06:13.687
And you dropped her hair?

02:06:15.692 --> 02:06:17.717
I know

02:06:43.520 --> 02:06:47.616
Now you can bring her back

02:06:47.724 --> 02:06:49.624
can't you?

02:06:53.297 --> 02:06:56.130
Give him what he wants

02:07:02.606 --> 02:07:07.009
Dearest David,
your wish is my command

02:07:30.734 --> 02:07:32.793
Hey, Joe, what do ya know?

02:08:17.547 --> 02:08:20.607
David, I often felt
a sort of envy of human beings...

02:08:20.717 --> 02:08:23.709
of that thing
they called spirit.

02:08:23.820 --> 02:08:27.347
Human beings had created a million
explanations of the meaning of life...

02:08:27.457 --> 02:08:30.915
in art, in poetry,
in mathematical formulas

02:08:31.027 --> 02:08:35.396
Certainly, human beings must be the key
to the meaning of existence

02:08:35.499 --> 02:08:38.491
But human beings
no longer existed

02:08:38.602 --> 02:08:41.537
So we began a project...

02:08:41.638 --> 02:08:45.597
that would make it possible to recreate
the living body of a person long dead...

02:08:45.709 --> 02:08:50.112
from the D.N.A. In a fragment
of bone or mummified skin

02:08:50.213 --> 02:08:52.909
We also wondered,
would it be possible...

02:08:53.016 --> 02:08:56.850
to retrieve a memory trace
in resonance with a recreated body?

02:08:56.953 --> 02:08:59.751
And you know what we found?

02:08:59.856 --> 02:09:04.020
We found the very fabric
of space-time itself...

02:09:04.127 --> 02:09:06.095
appeared to store information...

02:09:06.196 --> 02:09:09.529
about every event which had ever
occurred in the past

02:09:11.401 --> 02:09:15.770
But the experiment
was a failure

02:09:15.872 --> 02:09:20.775
for those who were resurrected only lived
through a single day of renewed life

02:09:20.877 --> 02:09:25.905
<i>When the resurrectees fell asleep</i>
<i>on the night of their first new day,</i>

02:09:26.016 --> 02:09:27.916
<i>they died again.</i>

02:09:28.018 --> 02:09:30.145
As soon as
they became unconscious

02:09:30.253 --> 02:09:34.883
their very existence
faded away into darkness

02:09:34.991 --> 02:09:36.891
So you see, David

02:09:36.993 --> 02:09:42.659
<i>the equations had shown that once an
individual space-time pathway had been used,</i>

02:09:42.766 --> 02:09:46.361
<i>it could not be reused.</i>

02:09:46.470 --> 02:09:49.871
<i>If we bring</i>
<i>your mother back now,</i>

02:09:49.973 --> 02:09:52.703
<i>it will only be for one day,</i>

02:09:52.809 --> 02:09:56.040
<i>and then you will never</i>
<i>be able to see her again.</i>

02:09:58.081 --> 02:09:59.981
Maybe...

02:10:03.153 --> 02:10:05.383
Maybe she will be special

02:10:07.023 --> 02:10:09.457
Maybe she will stay

02:10:09.559 --> 02:10:13.222
I thought this would be
hard for you to understand

02:10:13.330 --> 02:10:15.628
You were created to be so young

02:10:17.634 --> 02:10:22.162
Maybe the one day will be like
that one day inside the amphibicopter

02:10:23.306 --> 02:10:26.537
Maybe it will last forever

02:10:26.643 --> 02:10:31.580
<i>David, you are the enduring memory</i>
<i>of the human race.</i>

02:10:33.450 --> 02:10:37.386
The most lasting proof
of their genius

02:10:37.487 --> 02:10:41.446
We only want for your happiness

02:10:41.558 --> 02:10:43.458
David

02:10:43.560 --> 02:10:46.154
<i>you've had so little of that.</i>

02:10:47.697 --> 02:10:50.291
If you want for my happiness

02:10:51.935 --> 02:10:54.529
then you know
what you have to do

02:11:00.310 --> 02:11:03.211
Listen.

02:11:03.313 --> 02:11:05.213
Can you hear that?

02:11:10.353 --> 02:11:12.480
The new morning has come

02:11:21.064 --> 02:11:23.032
Go to her, David

02:11:26.169 --> 02:11:28.865
She's just waking up
this instant

02:13:08.004 --> 02:13:10.063
I found you

02:13:14.577 --> 02:13:16.477
Hi

02:13:16.579 --> 02:13:18.513
Hi

02:13:20.850 --> 02:13:23.250
I must have dozed off

02:13:25.388 --> 02:13:29.222
- How long have I...
- Would you like some coffee?

02:13:29.325 --> 02:13:31.350
Just the way you like it?

02:13:32.595 --> 02:13:34.495
Yeah, I'd love a coffee

02:13:36.700 --> 02:13:38.600
It'll wake me up

02:13:43.073 --> 02:13:44.973
Okay

02:14:03.727 --> 02:14:06.287
You never forget how, do you?

02:14:08.031 --> 02:14:09.931
No

02:14:11.367 --> 02:14:13.699
I never forget

02:14:18.742 --> 02:14:21.040
I must be a little confused

02:14:22.378 --> 02:14:24.403
What day is it?

02:14:26.983 --> 02:14:29.417
It is... today

02:14:31.688 --> 02:14:33.588
<i>And as the day wore on,</i>

02:14:33.690 --> 02:14:36.887
<i>David thought it was</i>
<i>the happiest day of his life.</i>

02:14:36.993 --> 02:14:40.121
<i>All the problems</i>
<i>seemed to have disappeared...</i>

02:14:40.230 --> 02:14:42.255
<i>from his mommy's mind.</i>

02:14:42.365 --> 02:14:44.265
<i>There was no Henry,</i>

02:14:44.367 --> 02:14:46.267
<i>there was no Martin,</i>

02:14:46.369 --> 02:14:48.394
<i>there was no grief.</i>

02:14:48.505 --> 02:14:50.405
<i>There was only David.</i>

02:15:00.950 --> 02:15:03.817
<i>David had been warned not</i>
<i>to explain anything to Monica.</i>

02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:07.651
<i>Otherwise, she would become frightened,</i>
<i>and everything would be spoiled.</i>

02:15:07.757 --> 02:15:10.658
<i>But David's journey home</i>
<i>belonged only to him,</i>

02:15:10.760 --> 02:15:13.194
<i>so he didn't see the harm</i>
<i>of painting her pictures of things...</i>

02:15:13.296 --> 02:15:15.196
<i>she would have no memory of.</i>

02:15:43.092 --> 02:15:47.153
<i>David had never had a birthday party</i>
<i>because David had never been born,</i>

02:15:47.263 --> 02:15:50.426
<i>so they baked a cake</i>
<i>and lit some candles.</i>

02:15:50.533 --> 02:15:53.866
- Now, make a wish.
- It came true already

02:16:00.577 --> 02:16:03.546
<i>By now, indeed,</i>
<i>the windows were beginning to dim.</i>

02:16:03.646 --> 02:16:05.546
<i>David drew the shades...</i>

02:16:05.648 --> 02:16:08.617
<i>without even needing</i>
<i>to be asked.</i>

02:16:17.060 --> 02:16:19.255
I really ought to be
tucking you in

02:16:21.130 --> 02:16:23.030
How strange

02:16:25.668 --> 02:16:28.660
How fascinating

02:16:33.977 --> 02:16:36.308
I can hardly keep my eyes open

02:16:38.047 --> 02:16:40.514
I don't know
what's come over me

02:16:46.556 --> 02:16:48.786
Such a beautiful day

02:16:52.028 --> 02:16:54.019
I love you, David

02:17:00.202 --> 02:17:02.296
I do love you

02:17:04.107 --> 02:17:07.008
I have always loved you

02:17:11.246 --> 02:17:14.808
<i>That was the everlasting</i>
<i>moment he had been waiting for.</i>

02:17:17.153 --> 02:17:19.519
<i>And the moment had passed,</i>

02:17:19.621 --> 02:17:21.954
<i>for Monica was sound asleep.</i>

02:17:23.526 --> 02:17:25.619
<i>More than merely asleep.</i>

02:17:27.397 --> 02:17:29.763
<i>Should he shake her,</i>
<i>she would never rouse.</i>

02:17:34.537 --> 02:17:36.437
<i>So David went to sleep too.</i>

02:17:38.374 --> 02:17:42.208
<i>And for the first time</i>
<i>in his life,</i>

02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:45.841
<i>he went to that place...</i>

02:17:47.016 --> 02:17:49.916
<i>where dreams are born.</i>
