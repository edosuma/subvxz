WEBVTT

00:06.040 --> 00:07.800
All right, heads he lives,
tails we do him.

00:09.440 --> 00:11.080
Who are you?

00:12.640 --> 00:13.880
-Thank you.
-What for?

00:13.920 --> 00:14.920
For saving my life.

00:14.960 --> 00:16.160
You've not been here long,

00:16.200 --> 00:19.000
yet already, I owe you
a whole litany of debts.

00:19.040 --> 00:20.080
Cait!

00:20.120 --> 00:22.000
Let's have a close look
at those eyes.

00:22.840 --> 00:23.840
Father, it's me.

00:23.880 --> 00:25.680
-Cait? Cait!
-I'm here. I'm here.

00:25.720 --> 00:28.360
Yesterday I sent an envoy
to parley with your father.

00:28.400 --> 00:29.840
Does he even know you're here?

00:29.880 --> 00:30.680
Formation!

00:31.640 --> 00:33.200
Out of nowhere,
they surrounded us.

00:33.240 --> 00:34.960
-How many?
-Two dozen, maybe more.

00:36.240 --> 00:37.120
How many down?

00:37.160 --> 00:39.240
I don't think
anyone survived.

00:39.280 --> 00:40.240
Except you.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.560
That's mine.

00:43.600 --> 00:44.520
Don't touch it.

00:45.400 --> 00:46.520
All texts
are forbidden.

00:46.560 --> 00:47.840
They are the work
of devils.

00:47.880 --> 00:49.280
That is what
our father believes,

00:49.320 --> 00:50.320
not you!

00:50.360 --> 00:53.160
If he knew what
you just told me,

00:53.200 --> 00:56.560
he'd do the same
as he did to our mother.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.360
The Druids now
will decide your fate.

00:58.400 --> 00:59.960
Then you throw me
to the winds.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.760
Know this.

01:00.800 --> 01:03.440
You are dead to me.

01:03.480 --> 01:04.680
The daughter, Kerra.

01:04.720 --> 01:05.480
I'm afraid...

01:05.519 --> 01:06.760
Afraid what?

01:06.800 --> 01:08.640
She keeps secrets from you.

01:08.680 --> 01:10.800
What secrets?

01:12.000 --> 01:18.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:11.080 --> 02:12.640
The Druids are the
eyes of the gods.

02:15.440 --> 02:17.280
They might want to see this.

03:51.280 --> 03:52.280
I washed it.

03:52.320 --> 03:55.120
Oh, you want me
to say thank you?

03:55.160 --> 03:56.960
You shouldn't have touched
Big Pebble in the first place.

03:58.480 --> 03:59.480
Well,
you got it back, didn't you?

04:03.360 --> 04:04.920
Why didn't you tell him
his daughter's dead?

04:10.040 --> 04:12.000
So he could sleep.

04:13.840 --> 04:14.760
And when he wakes?

04:14.800 --> 04:16.360
I thought you
had a mission.

04:16.399 --> 04:17.360
The camp's back that way.

04:17.399 --> 04:19.839
My plans...
have changed.

04:19.880 --> 04:20.640
Since when?

04:20.680 --> 04:22.240
Since I saw the General.

04:22.280 --> 04:24.280
Since I looked
in his eyes.

04:24.320 --> 04:25.800
And?

04:25.840 --> 04:26.840
I saw something.

04:28.480 --> 04:29.920
Saw what?

04:29.960 --> 04:31.160
I don't know.

04:35.040 --> 04:37.080
He's not a man.

04:37.120 --> 04:38.920
He's something...
he's something else,

04:38.960 --> 04:43.040
something...
far, far stronger.

04:44.640 --> 04:46.960
So what are you going to do?

04:47.000 --> 04:49.040
I have to think
about that.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.600
Yesterday,
you knew everything.

04:51.640 --> 04:53.880
Today, nothing.

04:53.920 --> 04:55.760
You sure you're the man
for this mission?

04:55.800 --> 04:57.760
Don't be ridiculous.
Of course I am...

04:57.800 --> 05:00.400
but I never said
it would be easy.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.960
If I were you,

05:06.000 --> 05:08.400
I'd follow
the hill paths west,

05:08.440 --> 05:09.320
to Crugdunon.

05:09.360 --> 05:11.640
King Pellenor
will protect you.

05:14.360 --> 05:15.800
Here.

05:17.720 --> 05:18.920
What's this?

05:18.960 --> 05:20.520
Mix it
with a handful of water.

05:20.560 --> 05:22.880
Bathe the sockets once a day,

05:22.920 --> 05:25.320
and he may make it
as far as the Citadel.

05:28.440 --> 05:29.760
Stay stinky.

05:45.280 --> 05:46.400
Is that you, child?

05:46.440 --> 05:47.920
It's me, Father.

05:52.040 --> 05:53.000
Where am I?

05:53.040 --> 05:54.000
We're safe,

05:54.040 --> 05:55.240
but we have to get away
from here.

05:56.320 --> 05:58.360
Can you stand?

05:58.400 --> 06:00.320
Of course I can stand.
I'm not that old.

06:06.160 --> 06:08.320
Is that comfortable?

06:08.360 --> 06:10.360
Not going to lie.

06:10.400 --> 06:13.040
Right now, not a
lot's comfortable.

06:30.360 --> 06:32.080
Where is she?

06:37.920 --> 06:39.240
She met with
the Romans,

06:39.280 --> 06:42.320
parleyed with them secretly,
when I forbade it.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.000
Why did you go?

06:47.440 --> 06:49.160
To stop them
crucifying our people.

06:51.160 --> 06:54.760
And what did the Romans
demand in return?

06:56.160 --> 06:58.640
Or was it a favour to you?

07:00.120 --> 07:02.400
I vowed that I would try
and persuade my father

07:02.440 --> 07:03.640
to speak with them.

07:03.680 --> 07:05.960
What is
Rome to you?

07:06.000 --> 07:08.960
Who do you serve?

07:10.520 --> 07:12.360
My loyalty
is to my tribe.

07:12.400 --> 07:15.960
Your mother used
those same words.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.920
My loyalty
is to my tribe alone.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.000
She's lying.

07:35.400 --> 07:36.400
What are these things?

07:37.400 --> 07:40.440
Roman artefacts
from the last invasion,

07:40.480 --> 07:42.440
hidden in her chamber.

07:42.480 --> 07:44.880
My mother gave
them to me...

07:44.920 --> 07:45.880
the night you took her.

07:45.920 --> 07:48.200
She was a sacrifice
to the gods.

07:48.240 --> 07:49.840
So you decided.

07:51.280 --> 07:54.440
She knows the written word
is forbidden.

07:54.480 --> 07:58.680
Only the gods have the power
to write the truth.

07:58.720 --> 07:59.960
So you cannot read them.

08:01.040 --> 08:03.840
No more than the runes
you scribed on my father's face.

08:07.480 --> 08:08.960
Do you fear the gods?

08:09.000 --> 08:11.400
The gods know my heart.

08:11.440 --> 08:12.640
Do you fear the gods?

08:12.680 --> 08:14.320
I fear them...

08:14.360 --> 08:16.800
but if loving my mother
angers the gods,

08:16.840 --> 08:18.040
they are no gods of mine.

08:27.560 --> 08:31.440
You just made
a very big decision.

08:31.480 --> 08:35.799
Now the gods will make theirs.

08:45.240 --> 08:49.040
Bad for morale,
keeping him alive.

08:49.080 --> 08:52.480
Since when do we
forgive mutineers?

08:52.520 --> 08:56.440
Bastards who kill
their comrades?

08:56.480 --> 08:59.360
When they've been somewhere
I need to know about.

08:59.400 --> 09:02.720
Then they're called "spies."

09:02.760 --> 09:04.480
Wait.

09:25.720 --> 09:29.160
Not quite back yet, are you?

09:29.200 --> 09:33.120
But when you are...

09:33.160 --> 09:35.600
I want to hear all about it.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.240
We used to stay
up like this

10:13.280 --> 10:15.960
when we were small.

10:16.960 --> 10:19.080
Remember what you
used to say to me?

10:21.200 --> 10:24.680
That you'd die before
you'd let anyone hurt me.

10:26.400 --> 10:29.480
You made a vow...

10:29.520 --> 10:32.640
a little prince's vow.

10:32.680 --> 10:34.720
I was so impressed.

10:34.760 --> 10:38.960
I was only
six, seven.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.200
To have such a serious,
grown-up brother

10:44.240 --> 10:46.520
defend me...

10:54.680 --> 10:56.240
I release you from that vow.

11:00.480 --> 11:02.640
I can handle
my own fate.

11:02.680 --> 11:04.520
You think I'm weak.

11:04.560 --> 11:07.000
No.

11:07.040 --> 11:08.040
No.

11:11.080 --> 11:12.840
You have to promise
me something.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.160
When you're king,

11:16.200 --> 11:17.760
you make your own choices.

11:17.800 --> 11:21.200
Don't bow to the will
of the Druids.

11:21.240 --> 11:23.400
You cannot let them
destroy us both.

11:23.440 --> 11:24.520
Promise me.

12:07.600 --> 12:09.680
You know the way out of here.

12:11.920 --> 12:13.440
By morning,
we'll be at the coast.

12:15.080 --> 12:16.840
Two nights' sailing,
we'll be in Gaul.

12:22.240 --> 12:24.960
And what welcome
will await us there?

12:28.640 --> 12:30.760
I can't wait that long.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.520
I have been very far away.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.440
The voices were clear.

13:25.840 --> 13:29.080
Are you ready to follow
the will of the gods?

13:37.360 --> 13:38.880
We are ready.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.080
The gods have decided...

13:49.440 --> 13:51.200
that you will be
the sacrifice,

13:51.240 --> 13:53.440
King Pellenor.

13:53.480 --> 13:55.600
You must surrender
yourself to them.

13:55.640 --> 13:56.720
No!

14:02.840 --> 14:05.840
Do you accept
the gods' judgment?

14:12.960 --> 14:14.160
I do.

14:36.840 --> 14:38.960
I always knew
his last breath as king

14:39.000 --> 14:41.440
would be my first...

14:41.480 --> 14:43.680
but I'm not ready...

14:45.280 --> 14:46.320
not ready
to see him go.

14:52.440 --> 14:53.800
Sister.

14:55.160 --> 14:57.120
Congratulations.

14:57.160 --> 14:59.040
Seems the gods have
been merciful...

14:59.080 --> 15:00.720
to some.

15:00.760 --> 15:02.640
Excuse me.

15:06.600 --> 15:07.760
Have you spoken
to them yet?

15:07.800 --> 15:09.240
Who?

15:09.280 --> 15:11.200
What do you mean, who?

15:11.240 --> 15:13.360
The Druids.

15:13.400 --> 15:14.960
You need their blessing.

15:19.320 --> 15:20.440
You are a monster.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.040
I know why you don't dare
speak with the Druids...

15:24.080 --> 15:25.440
because in your heart,

15:25.480 --> 15:28.280
you know that you
are too weak to lead us.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.200
Prove me wrong.

15:31.240 --> 15:32.320
Look me in the eye

15:32.360 --> 15:35.320
and show me that
you're not afraid.

15:35.360 --> 15:38.480
When I look at you,
I do fear something.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.560
I fear that the gods
are insane

15:40.600 --> 15:43.000
for ever
putting us together.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.560
Well, if you won't
speak with them,

15:48.600 --> 15:50.240
I will.

16:02.760 --> 16:05.600
I've sent messengers
to your general

16:05.640 --> 16:09.000
to grant us safe passage
to our burial grounds,

16:09.040 --> 16:11.280
in return for your life.

16:25.720 --> 16:29.760
What's the scariest thing
you can tell me right now?

16:29.800 --> 16:33.800
What is
the absolute worst thing

16:33.840 --> 16:36.200
that I should be afraid of?

16:43.920 --> 16:47.400
Many legions have sailed
to your islands.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.560
You see, but my legion,

16:49.600 --> 16:51.840
the Ninth,

16:51.880 --> 16:53.280
is the worst thing
on this earth

16:53.320 --> 16:55.520
that you want to face.

16:56.640 --> 17:00.320
We have a general.

17:00.360 --> 17:01.320
This...

17:02.360 --> 17:04.319
this man...

17:06.240 --> 17:08.200
his weapon is not the sword.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
His weapon is you.

17:13.040 --> 17:16.599
He uses your right arm
to fight your left,

17:16.640 --> 17:18.839
and your left eye
to suspect your right,

17:18.880 --> 17:21.599
and before you know it...

17:23.119 --> 17:25.720
you'll have torn out
your eyes...

17:27.599 --> 17:29.240
and ripped out
your fucking heart.

17:32.120 --> 17:33.520
Your biggest fear...

17:34.600 --> 17:38.760
his name is Aulus Plautius.

18:05.120 --> 18:06.120
General!

18:08.600 --> 18:11.120
They just butchered
one of our patrols,

18:11.160 --> 18:14.560
and now they want
safe passage?

18:14.600 --> 18:15.520
To where?

18:15.560 --> 18:18.200
Their sacred burial ground.

18:18.240 --> 18:19.320
It's called The Amber Palace.

18:21.160 --> 18:22.880
At this point,
the old Aulus

18:22.920 --> 18:24.440
would be crucifying
the messenger.

18:31.600 --> 18:32.880
They have Vitus.
He's their prisoner.

18:34.640 --> 18:37.000
They want to trade Vitus
in return for safe passage.

18:37.040 --> 18:40.000
Vitus is one man.

18:40.040 --> 18:43.360
A man who has been
inside their Citadel,

18:43.400 --> 18:45.400
and I want to know
what he knows.

18:46.720 --> 18:47.560
You okay?

18:48.600 --> 18:49.880
Yeah.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.280
I'm fine.
I've just, uh...

18:52.320 --> 18:55.040
just, I think
I've got the...

18:57.960 --> 19:00.400
You knew about this.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.800
You knew they'd sacrifice
their king, didn't you?

19:02.840 --> 19:04.480
You made this happen.

19:04.520 --> 19:07.240
Not me. The gods.

19:08.320 --> 19:10.880
The gods have spoken.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.080
Tell your people
they can have safe passage

19:17.120 --> 19:19.240
in exchange for our optio.

19:19.280 --> 19:22.040
In the name of the Cantii,
we thank you.

19:22.080 --> 19:24.120
Now, get out
of my sight.

19:26.440 --> 19:28.080
Follow him.
Take four men.

19:28.120 --> 19:30.080
Keep a safe distance.

19:32.360 --> 19:36.360
I want to know all I can
about this Amber Palace.

19:54.600 --> 19:55.920
My trusted elders.

19:55.960 --> 19:58.160
The king
has been purified.

19:58.200 --> 19:59.680
Only we touch him now.

20:07.880 --> 20:11.240
When the Druids
read these runes to me,

20:11.280 --> 20:15.000
and I know, finally,
how the gods see me...

20:16.520 --> 20:19.240
I trust I'll be content.

20:21.600 --> 20:24.960
I hope they tell me
I've done my best,

20:25.000 --> 20:27.880
and the Cantii will prosper...

20:27.920 --> 20:32.040
long after we've all gone

20:32.080 --> 20:34.520
to the Other Place.

20:36.760 --> 20:40.760
I'll see you there,
brothers...

20:40.800 --> 20:42.160
and sister.

21:09.800 --> 21:11.680
The sun is shining.

21:11.720 --> 21:14.560
I can feel it on my face.

21:14.600 --> 21:16.920
It is.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.240
Let's rest a while.

21:23.280 --> 21:25.760
It's a long way
to Crugdunon.

21:25.800 --> 21:27.960
We're not going there.
We're going home.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.720
Islene is waiting for us.

21:38.320 --> 21:39.480
Father...

21:41.440 --> 21:42.400
I lied to you.

21:42.440 --> 21:44.120
Islene's...

21:46.160 --> 21:47.520
Islene's dead.

21:49.640 --> 21:50.760
I'm sorry.

21:50.800 --> 21:53.080
I didn't know what to say.

22:00.840 --> 22:02.320
I'm sorry.

22:02.360 --> 22:03.600
Get away from me.

22:03.640 --> 22:05.360
Get away!

22:05.400 --> 22:07.080
Islene!

22:08.600 --> 22:10.360
Islene!

22:13.600 --> 22:14.840
Islene!

22:15.680 --> 22:17.640
Islene!

22:30.760 --> 22:32.480
May I
speak with you?

22:44.680 --> 22:47.360
The Romans
will come to Crugdunon.

22:47.400 --> 22:48.360
Sooner or later,
they will come.

22:54.720 --> 22:56.200
In order
for our tribe to survive,

22:56.240 --> 22:57.360
the Cantii need a king

22:57.400 --> 22:59.360
who can stand
against the Romans,

22:59.400 --> 23:00.480
a strong king.

23:03.680 --> 23:06.280
Is your husband, Phelan,
not strong?

23:06.320 --> 23:08.480
He's the natural successor.

23:08.520 --> 23:12.080
It is true I have
a strong husband...

23:12.120 --> 23:13.360
but his name is not Phelan.

23:15.920 --> 23:18.640
His name
is Lindon of the Gaul...

23:18.680 --> 23:19.640
the man you chose for me.

23:19.680 --> 23:21.840
The man the gods chose.

23:23.360 --> 23:25.880
The gods know
that Phelan is weak.

23:25.920 --> 23:27.720
That is why
they delivered me Lindon.

23:27.760 --> 23:30.960
The gods wanted you
to bear children.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.600
Is there a problem there?

23:41.640 --> 23:43.120
Lindon and I
shall have many children.

23:45.680 --> 23:48.080
Together, we can lead our
people through this darkness.

23:49.760 --> 23:52.080
That is why I come to you...

23:53.800 --> 23:56.480
you who speak
for the gods,

23:56.520 --> 23:59.800
you who are like the plagues...

23:59.840 --> 24:02.600
the waves...

24:02.640 --> 24:04.360
famine...

24:04.400 --> 24:06.240
sun.

24:06.280 --> 24:09.920
If you knew who I was,
you would not be here.

24:09.960 --> 24:12.200
Forgive me.

24:14.480 --> 24:16.120
I came to speak
from my heart.

24:16.160 --> 24:18.000
Do you even know
your heart?

24:18.040 --> 24:19.760
Have you seen it?

24:21.680 --> 24:24.400
I'd know your heart
if I could hold it in my hand,

24:24.440 --> 24:26.920
touch it
with these fingers.

24:26.960 --> 24:29.240
Warm...

24:29.280 --> 24:30.960
still beating...

24:32.960 --> 24:36.000
I could know you then,
Amena of the Cantii.

24:45.240 --> 24:47.760
Ask for rain.

24:47.800 --> 24:51.080
Ask the hawk
to spare the mouse.

24:51.120 --> 24:52.760
Ask,

24:52.800 --> 24:54.240
and you will see...

24:54.280 --> 24:58.960
what's happening here
is beyond us.

25:01.240 --> 25:03.880
It's always been
beyond us.

25:05.880 --> 25:07.680
It's beautiful.

25:24.400 --> 25:26.520
Don't be scared.

25:26.560 --> 25:27.680
He likes you.

25:28.960 --> 25:30.920
Go to his tent
tonight.

25:30.960 --> 25:33.760
Suck his cock.

25:35.800 --> 25:38.800
Maybe then, the gods
will smile on you.

25:49.320 --> 25:51.160
Legionnaire!

26:02.600 --> 26:04.440
Sir.

26:29.600 --> 26:32.160
What's...

26:32.200 --> 26:33.600
what's it for, sir?

26:33.640 --> 26:35.600
Valour.

26:37.280 --> 26:38.840
Bravery in extremis.

26:42.160 --> 26:44.760
You're too moved to thank me.
I understand.

26:47.360 --> 26:48.240
Brutus Marius...

26:50.440 --> 26:53.000
Order of Britannia.

26:57.120 --> 26:59.240
I've got a little job for you.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.720
When he starts talking,
you come and get me.

27:15.760 --> 27:16.720
You understand?

27:16.760 --> 27:18.280
Aye, General.

27:28.680 --> 27:31.040
Might help
jog his memory.

27:37.720 --> 27:39.080
Fucking hell...

28:10.760 --> 28:12.400
You gave the queen blueberries.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.000
You should
finish them all.

29:16.800 --> 29:18.400
Don't break the nest.

29:18.440 --> 29:20.320
We need the eggs.

29:23.400 --> 29:25.160
It's perfect.
Any bones?

29:30.000 --> 29:32.600
We'll need a few more,
and bigger, if you can.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.400
and feathers...

29:34.440 --> 29:35.480
Are we making arrows?

29:35.520 --> 29:37.680
How do we boil the bones?
We've no pan.

29:37.720 --> 29:40.040
We're not making arrows.

29:40.080 --> 29:42.360
A snare, is it?
Well, we'll need bait.

29:42.400 --> 29:44.680
Go.
Find the bones.

29:44.720 --> 29:45.560
Be careful.

30:10.360 --> 30:12.240
Ohh..

30:15.000 --> 30:16.040
Surely that's enough.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.520
No.

30:17.560 --> 30:18.720
It's what the
gods command.

30:30.200 --> 30:33.040
Did you check
the grain stores today?

30:34.400 --> 30:35.920
I'll check them tomorrow.

30:35.960 --> 30:37.280
Yeah, well...

30:37.320 --> 30:40.600
see that you do.

30:40.640 --> 30:43.160
Warriors need to be fed,
or they grow lax.

30:49.920 --> 30:50.880
I don't want it this way.

30:50.920 --> 30:54.840
It's the way of kings.

30:54.880 --> 30:59.320
We're called to serve,
to please the gods.

31:06.680 --> 31:08.800
I made your life hard...

31:11.400 --> 31:13.680
decisions
I've taken.

31:18.120 --> 31:21.080
I loved your mother once...

31:23.360 --> 31:28.200
but when the gods said
she must die...

31:28.240 --> 31:29.320
should I have wavered?

31:32.760 --> 31:34.880
Should I have
defied them?

31:38.680 --> 31:41.720
No, no, no.

31:51.080 --> 31:54.120
I pray
you'll serve our people well.

31:57.600 --> 31:59.240
That's all I desire, Father.

32:11.840 --> 32:15.280
He won't see me.

32:15.320 --> 32:17.240
I'm sorry...

32:30.160 --> 32:32.320
I thought
last night was my last.

32:34.880 --> 32:35.680
And?

32:37.080 --> 32:40.440
When my brother becomes king...

32:40.480 --> 32:42.720
you'll still be married
to his queen.

32:44.200 --> 32:47.960
Our tribe needs this family
to be united, Lindon.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.640
No.

32:49.680 --> 32:52.280
When you know what you want,
you do it.

32:52.320 --> 32:55.080
I won't be bound to any man.

33:05.240 --> 33:07.680
It's not too late.

33:07.720 --> 33:11.480
Speak to your daughter.
Forgive her.

33:11.520 --> 33:12.720
I beg you.

33:12.760 --> 33:16.400
No... no...

33:19.440 --> 33:21.640
no.

33:26.880 --> 33:28.080
When I was your age,

33:28.120 --> 33:30.920
one of the elders
snapped his back,

33:30.960 --> 33:32.120
and his wife called in
the Druids.

33:33.320 --> 33:35.720
The Druid who came

33:35.760 --> 33:38.600
used a sparrow nest
and rabbit bones...

33:38.640 --> 33:39.720
crow feathers,

33:39.760 --> 33:41.760
and he moved his
hands over them,

33:41.800 --> 33:43.440
and when he was
finished,

33:43.480 --> 33:46.600
old Ruggan comes walking
out of his hut

33:46.640 --> 33:47.920
like nothing ever happened.

33:49.160 --> 33:50.160
He turned back time...

33:51.200 --> 33:54.720
made everything
as it was before.

33:54.760 --> 33:55.560
He begged the sun,

33:55.600 --> 33:57.640
and the sun...

33:57.680 --> 33:59.520
it went backwards
through the sky,

33:59.560 --> 34:00.840
and the day was born over.

34:00.880 --> 34:03.200
The day was born over,

34:03.240 --> 34:05.240
and this is
how he did it...

34:05.280 --> 34:06.720
and my Islene

34:06.760 --> 34:08.840
will come walking
through those trees

34:08.880 --> 34:10.639
like nothing ever happened.

34:10.679 --> 34:12.520
You see?
You see now?

34:12.560 --> 34:14.040
You see what we
can do here?

34:14.080 --> 34:15.600
Yes, Father.

34:20.400 --> 34:23.000
Today, you carry a king.

34:44.320 --> 34:46.000
Happy now?

34:46.040 --> 34:46.960
Follow with
the others.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.679
We'll be there at sunset.

34:48.719 --> 34:50.159
You Druids...

34:50.199 --> 34:52.239
think you're like the wind...

34:53.600 --> 34:55.360
like earthquakes...

34:56.440 --> 34:58.440
but you're not, are you?

34:58.480 --> 34:59.360
How can you be?

35:06.120 --> 35:08.400
You see it very clearly.

35:09.720 --> 35:13.520
The gods gave you good eyes.

35:13.560 --> 35:16.320
Watch very carefully.

35:49.400 --> 35:50.840
Behold the power of Rome!

35:53.920 --> 35:56.840
Behold the power of Rome!

35:59.400 --> 36:03.920
Behold... the power of Rome!

38:16.480 --> 38:18.760
Tell me what is written.

38:23.120 --> 38:26.800
You were Pellenor,
King of the Cantii,

38:26.840 --> 38:28.280
chosen by the gods.

38:28.320 --> 38:31.280
The gods took
your beloved wife.

38:31.320 --> 38:34.120
Your heart was against it,

38:34.160 --> 38:37.320
but you obeyed the gods.

38:37.360 --> 38:41.120
A darkness entered you...

38:41.160 --> 38:44.160
darkness you cast
upon your children,

38:44.200 --> 38:47.000
and you were broken.

38:47.040 --> 38:49.920
A broken father.

38:49.960 --> 38:51.920
A broken king.

38:51.960 --> 38:54.400
I did the gods' will!

38:54.440 --> 38:55.880
What more do the runes say?

38:55.920 --> 38:58.360
What more?

38:58.400 --> 38:59.560
That is all.

38:59.600 --> 39:02.200
No, I...!

39:02.240 --> 39:05.440
I was more than that!
More!

39:05.480 --> 39:09.720
That is what you take
to the next place.

39:25.880 --> 39:27.240
No...

39:27.280 --> 39:28.280
No!

39:30.920 --> 39:32.680
No!

39:32.720 --> 39:35.120
No...

39:49.240 --> 39:50.240
Kerra!

40:01.640 --> 40:02.640
Forgive me.

40:10.720 --> 40:13.840
I don't know how...

40:13.880 --> 40:17.440
but if your faith
is the truth...

40:17.480 --> 40:19.360
we will meet in
the next world.

40:23.400 --> 40:24.240
Aah!

40:38.080 --> 40:40.400
It's stopped, hasn't it?

40:40.440 --> 40:43.000
The gods are stopping the sun!

40:43.040 --> 40:44.480
Islene!

40:44.520 --> 40:45.480
I'm here!
Come now!

40:45.520 --> 40:46.400
Please stop.

40:46.440 --> 40:48.320
I can hear her.
She's near.

40:48.360 --> 40:50.240
Sulis, sulis, sulis...

40:53.480 --> 40:56.680
I beg you, I beg you...
sulis... listen...

40:56.720 --> 40:58.680
No...
no...

40:58.720 --> 40:59.880
Sulis ymbiliaf!

40:59.920 --> 41:01.640
Sulis ymbiliaf!

41:01.680 --> 41:03.680
Sulis, sulis gwared...

41:03.720 --> 41:05.960
ymbiliaf fy nghri sulis.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.280
Sulis! Sulis!
Sulis gwared...

41:12.280 --> 41:15.120
Sulis... sulis gwared...

41:18.680 --> 41:20.160
Where are you, my gods?

41:20.200 --> 41:23.440
Where... are... my... gods?

43:57.000 --> 43:58.920
Kneel.

44:19.920 --> 44:22.080
From this night...

44:22.120 --> 44:25.880
you are Queen Kerra
of the Cantii.

44:29.080 --> 44:31.880
Your eyes now lead us.

44:31.920 --> 44:34.240
What do they see?

45:24.040 --> 45:26.480
When I was cold,

45:26.520 --> 45:28.960
you kept me warm.

45:29.000 --> 45:32.320
When I wept,
you comforted me.

45:35.920 --> 45:40.080
Because of you...

45:40.120 --> 45:41.880
I belong.

45:45.120 --> 45:47.120
When you are
a child again...

45:47.160 --> 45:49.320
weak, helpless...

45:51.160 --> 45:53.440
I will protect you.

45:56.640 --> 45:59.280
I will protect you.
