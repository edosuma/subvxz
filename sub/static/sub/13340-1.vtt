00:04.569 --> 00:06.702
- Previously
on "Good Girls"...

00:06.745 --> 00:08.095
- Are we going
to lose this house?

00:08.138 --> 00:09.357
- I mean, I don't know.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.446
- Nancy and I are suing you
for custody.

00:11.489 --> 00:13.361
- I would suggest
that we put Sara

00:13.404 --> 00:14.797
on a list
for a transplant.

00:14.840 --> 00:17.017
- How much is in the vault?
- 30 grand.

00:17.060 --> 00:18.583
- So when do you want
to do this?

00:18.627 --> 00:21.499
- Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a robbery.

00:21.543 --> 00:23.371
- Why does a grocery store
even have this kind of money?

00:23.414 --> 00:25.068
- Because it's hella shady!

00:25.112 --> 00:26.722
- Why don't you stop worrying
about my business

00:26.765 --> 00:28.680
and start figuring how you
gonna pay me my money back?

00:28.724 --> 00:30.160
- We have
a business proposition

00:30.204 --> 00:31.596
to clean your fake money.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.772
Let us do it right here.

00:33.816 --> 00:35.513
Fake money in,
real money out.

00:35.557 --> 00:36.688
- Do you want all this back
on the card?

00:36.732 --> 00:38.212
- Cash is fine.

00:38.255 --> 00:39.691
You want to bring other people
into this now?

00:39.735 --> 00:41.432
- The more you buy and return,

00:41.476 --> 00:43.086
the more money
you're going to make.

00:43.130 --> 00:44.827
- I don't know what
you've gotten me involved in,

00:44.870 --> 00:47.047
but it's something
super shady.

00:47.090 --> 00:50.180
- She's extorting us
to tune of $10,000!

00:50.224 --> 00:51.529
- Annie...
I mean, girls like that--

00:51.573 --> 00:53.096
they want
that kind of attention.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.445
- Is that why you tried
to rape her?

00:54.489 --> 00:56.099
- No!

00:56.143 --> 00:58.362
I saw this guy. Whatever
they're into, he's involved.

00:58.406 --> 01:00.060
- I'm just wondering where
a nice lady like you

01:00.103 --> 01:01.496
meets an inner-city gangbanger.

01:01.539 --> 01:03.106
- Maybe we should turn
ourselves in.

01:03.150 --> 01:05.543
- He's the one
who should be in jail, not us.

01:05.587 --> 01:07.458
- All we have to do
is get the vault open,

01:07.502 --> 01:08.677
and the cops will do
the rest.

01:08.720 --> 01:10.331
- Annie,
put all that money back now.

01:10.374 --> 01:12.202
- There has to be something
that you want.

01:12.246 --> 01:14.552
- The Feds and the DPD took
his gang down last night

01:14.596 --> 01:17.599
because these two women robbed
the place a couple nights ago.

01:18.904 --> 01:20.558
- I did it for us.
- I'm a cop.

01:20.602 --> 01:22.082
What the hell
am I supposed to do?

01:22.125 --> 01:23.561
- Sadie needs you, too.

01:23.605 --> 01:25.302
- That is exactly
what I needed to hear.

01:25.346 --> 01:26.564
- We just did in two seconds

01:26.608 --> 01:28.523
what they pay lawyers
for in blood.

01:28.566 --> 01:29.785
- Surprise.

01:29.828 --> 01:31.743
You're trying to put me away
and all,

01:31.787 --> 01:33.571
you must got big plans.

Yours are angels.

- Beach.

03:12.409 --> 03:14.890
- Ah, señora Cohen
would be so disappointed.

03:14.933 --> 03:17.240
- I heard she got hit

03:17.284 --> 03:18.807
- Autobus.

03:18.850 --> 03:20.417
- Greg...

03:20.461 --> 03:22.376
- No, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
She was really cool.

03:22.419 --> 03:23.942
- No, no, it's--

03:23.986 --> 03:26.249
This is cheating.

03:26.293 --> 03:29.861
- No, no, it's not.

03:35.389 --> 03:38.609
- Oh, my God.
Why have you forsaken me?

03:38.653 --> 03:41.351
Ow! Greg!
- Oh, sorry. Sorry.

03:43.919 --> 03:45.573
We were doing so good.

03:45.616 --> 03:47.401
- I know. I know.

03:47.444 --> 03:49.968
- We were, like,
for-real adulting.

03:50.012 --> 03:51.709
- Yeah, but,
you know, the thing is

03:51.753 --> 03:54.277
that we got, like,
a kid together.

03:54.321 --> 03:57.889
- So, what, it's like
a tricky gray area?

03:57.933 --> 04:00.022
- Kind of.

04:03.068 --> 04:05.506
- We're--we're
just hammered, right?

04:08.465 --> 04:11.555
- I'm not actually
that hammered.

04:11.599 --> 04:13.775
- I'm barely buzzed.

04:28.659 --> 04:30.879
- Harry's down.

04:32.750 --> 04:34.752
He was making a poster for Sara

04:34.796 --> 04:36.841
but got tired halfway through.

04:36.885 --> 04:39.453
It says "welcome ho."

04:39.496 --> 04:41.846
- Hand me those.

04:47.765 --> 04:49.419
- Really?

04:49.463 --> 04:51.639
- Oh, yeah.

04:54.598 --> 04:56.948
- Make sure you get up early
so he doesn't see you.

04:56.992 --> 04:58.602
- I'm not lying to my kids.

04:58.646 --> 05:00.604
- Okay.
- That's your M.O.

05:02.476 --> 05:03.781
- What do you want here, Ruby?

05:03.825 --> 05:06.349
Hmm? You want to act
like nothing's wrong?

05:06.393 --> 05:09.787
You want to cuddle?
You want to watch reality TV?

05:09.831 --> 05:11.789
Well, guess what, baby.
I'm living it.

05:11.833 --> 05:14.052
- Stan--
- No, the things you did...

05:14.096 --> 05:17.665
- We needed the money.
- Everybody needs money!

05:17.708 --> 05:20.798
Everybody,
but normal people--

05:20.842 --> 05:23.366
good people,
they don't do what you did.

05:23.410 --> 05:25.803
All those nights
you slept like a baby

05:25.847 --> 05:29.024
right next to me
with your shady lying ass.

05:29.067 --> 05:31.548
- A street gang
was going to kill us.

05:31.592 --> 05:32.680
- Well, then you come to me!

05:32.723 --> 05:35.117
- I didn't want
to involve you.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.424
- And here we are.

05:41.689 --> 05:43.386
- What are you doing?
- What?

05:43.430 --> 05:44.822
- Why are you doing that?

05:44.866 --> 05:46.389
- Because you and your
girlfriends thought

05:46.433 --> 05:48.696
you could put a gang away.

05:53.527 --> 05:55.137
They made bail.

06:01.578 --> 06:04.886
- Hey, honey. We're home.

06:08.716 --> 06:09.978
Come on, Beth.

06:11.545 --> 06:13.460
- I thought you wanted
to be me.

06:13.503 --> 06:14.852
I mean, that's
what all this is, right?

06:14.896 --> 06:16.071
You trying
to put me away and all,

06:16.114 --> 06:18.682
you must got big plans.

06:18.726 --> 06:21.729
But see, you didn't think
things all the way through.

06:23.165 --> 06:24.732
It takes balls
to do what I do.

06:24.775 --> 06:26.690
You want to be the king,
you got to kill the king.

06:26.734 --> 06:28.170
This stuff's medieval,
darling.

06:28.213 --> 06:29.867
Please don't do this.

06:29.911 --> 06:31.695
Please don't kill us.

06:31.739 --> 06:35.873
-  I ain't--
I ain't gonna kill nobody.

06:37.571 --> 06:38.920
You are.

06:50.105 --> 06:52.803
- So what you think?

06:52.847 --> 06:55.719
You got what it takes?

06:57.547 --> 06:59.027
- Do it, Beth.

06:59.070 --> 07:00.855
- Please shut up.

07:00.898 --> 07:03.684
- Just shoot him.
- Shut up!

07:07.252 --> 07:08.732
How do I know it's loaded?

07:08.776 --> 07:10.473
- Oh, you can tell
by the weight.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.519
You know,
a full clip adds a pound.

07:12.562 --> 07:13.955
- Or you could just pull
the trigger.

07:13.998 --> 07:15.565
- Dean, shut up!

07:17.524 --> 07:20.178
What are you doing?

07:20.222 --> 07:22.964
- Oh, you thought you could
skip this part, huh?

07:23.007 --> 07:26.837
See--see, that's--that's
your problem right there.

07:26.881 --> 07:28.926
You want to get down
in the dirt so bad,

07:28.970 --> 07:31.233
but you want to keep
your hands clean, huh?

07:31.276 --> 07:33.104
- Do it, Beth, please.

07:33.148 --> 07:34.932
- You sit back down.

07:34.976 --> 07:36.760
- Do it, Beth.
- Sit!

07:38.632 --> 07:41.591
- What are you doing, Beth?

07:41.635 --> 07:43.593
- What are you doing,
Elizabeth?

07:47.858 --> 07:50.600
I don't know.

07:50.644 --> 07:53.647
I just want it to be over.

07:53.690 --> 07:55.126
- Yeah?

08:01.524 --> 08:03.134
Okay.

08:03.178 --> 08:05.615
Let's end it.

08:05.659 --> 08:07.269
For real.

08:08.923 --> 08:11.795
- It's all right.
It's okay.

08:15.799 --> 08:17.714
You did your best.

08:32.207 --> 08:34.296
- Okay.

08:34.339 --> 08:37.212
Now we're good, darling.

09:26.696 --> 09:29.264

09:29.307 --> 09:31.919

09:31.962 --> 09:34.617

09:34.661 --> 09:38.273

Oh, my God.
I am so sorry.

- Are you happy or sad?
- I don't know.

10:18.182 --> 10:21.621
It's just the idea
that, like--

10:21.664 --> 10:24.580
I couldn't shoot the person
that, by all accounts,

10:24.624 --> 10:25.755
deserved it--

10:25.799 --> 10:29.150
I mean,
the violent gang leader.

10:29.193 --> 10:33.371
And then there's just--poor
Dean, he's just sitting there.

10:33.415 --> 10:36.984
And then, like,
all of a sudden, like...

10:37.027 --> 10:39.595
I mean,
talk about a drive-by.

10:41.728 --> 10:44.295
A drive-by.
- Okay.

10:44.339 --> 10:46.297
- I guess that's
kind of funny.

10:47.821 --> 10:49.649
- Come on.

10:54.262 --> 10:57.004
I hope your loved ones
are okay.

10:57.047 --> 10:59.397
I do.

10:59.441 --> 11:01.182
- Mrs. Boland.

11:01.225 --> 11:03.445
- Present.

11:03.488 --> 11:06.187
- She's really upset.

11:06.230 --> 11:08.363
- Your husband is going
to be fine.

11:08.406 --> 11:09.712
Another half inch
to the right,

11:09.756 --> 11:11.366
the bullet would've nicked
his aorta.

11:11.409 --> 11:13.237
We'd be having
a very different conversation.

11:13.281 --> 11:15.239
- Wait.
He's not dead?

11:15.283 --> 11:18.286
- No, he has a long road ahead,
but his--his vitals are stable.

11:27.643 --> 11:30.428
- I didn't kill my husband.

11:31.386 --> 11:33.518
- Yay.

11:33.562 --> 11:36.565
- Look at that.
- So good.

11:39.263 --> 11:41.396
- He's going to kill me.

11:46.314 --> 11:48.098
- Talk to me.
What do we got?

11:48.142 --> 11:51.319
- Um, a green bean.
Could be edamame.

11:51.362 --> 11:53.321
- Bag it.

11:53.364 --> 11:55.758
- Ooh, and a--and a pacifier.

11:58.239 --> 11:59.631
- Bag it, tag it.

12:02.286 --> 12:04.245
- The cops already
did this, Leslie.

12:13.602 --> 12:16.170
- I don't know what
those girls promised you

12:16.213 --> 12:18.520
or how much you got paid,

12:18.563 --> 12:20.652
but we both know
you sold out here...

12:20.696 --> 12:22.263
big-time.

12:22.306 --> 12:23.873
Got it?

12:23.917 --> 12:25.745
- Y-yes, Mr. Peterson.

12:27.616 --> 12:29.531
- Now get back down there
and find me some justice.

12:29.574 --> 12:32.621
- Y-yes. I'm on it,
Mr. Peterson.

12:32.664 --> 12:34.579
- Hey, hey!

12:34.623 --> 12:36.494
This is a crime scene.

12:36.538 --> 12:38.627
Behind the line.

12:49.159 --> 12:50.682
- Are you kidding me, man?

12:50.726 --> 12:52.423
- How you been, Jimmy?

12:52.467 --> 12:54.686
- Do you know what time it is?
- Who is it?

12:54.730 --> 12:57.820
- It's a work thing.
I got it.

12:57.864 --> 13:00.127
- Didn't know you had
a roommate.

13:00.170 --> 13:01.824
- What are you doing here?

13:01.868 --> 13:06.655
- You might want to round up
your team ASAP

13:06.698 --> 13:09.832
and let them know
they missed some stuff.

13:12.966 --> 13:14.924
It's just I watch
"The First 48," so I know--

13:14.968 --> 13:16.839
- You don't show up at my home
like a crazy person

13:16.883 --> 13:17.884
unless you're a crazy person.

13:17.927 --> 13:20.321
Are you crazy, Leslie?
Huh?

13:20.364 --> 13:21.844
'Cause if you are,
things are going to go down

13:21.888 --> 13:23.498
a whole lot differently.

13:23.541 --> 13:25.674
I'm not going to be
so reasonable. You feel me?

13:30.548 --> 13:32.812
Those girls--
they are playing you.

13:32.855 --> 13:35.510
They are right under your nose
laughing their asses off.

13:35.553 --> 13:37.555
- Get out of here.

14:01.928 --> 14:04.408
- ♪ Yeah, I been

14:15.898 --> 14:18.553

- Yes, please, yes.

14:18.596 --> 14:19.946
- Hey, little people.

14:19.989 --> 14:22.470
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:22.513 --> 14:25.603
- Hey, how was your day?

14:25.647 --> 14:28.389
- Hey, how did Uncle Dean
get shot?

14:28.432 --> 14:32.915
- Uh, He was downtown late at
night, and someone robbed him.

14:32.959 --> 14:35.744
- Did you know the guy?
- No. Absolutely not.

14:35.787 --> 14:37.572
It was completely random.

14:37.615 --> 14:38.878
I mean, honestly,

14:38.921 --> 14:40.531
these things kind of happen
all the time.

14:40.575 --> 14:42.403
- They do?
- Well, I mean--

14:42.446 --> 14:45.972
I mean,
not all the time, no.

14:46.015 --> 14:48.757
But, I mean,
you never know.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.759
- What'd they take?

14:50.802 --> 14:52.456
- Nothing.

14:52.500 --> 14:53.849
- You just said he got robbed.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.938
- Take your pills, woman.
Take your pills.

14:55.982 --> 14:57.722
- Fine.

15:01.726 --> 15:03.641
- Who wants pizza?

15:03.685 --> 15:05.600
- What if it's the bad guy?

15:05.643 --> 15:07.471
- Bad guy don't ring doorbells.

15:07.515 --> 15:09.952
- ♪ Got it yelling,

15:18.526 --> 15:20.441
- Hey.

15:22.617 --> 15:24.575
Have you had a week.

15:24.619 --> 15:27.535
Forensics found
a pen cap in the store.

15:27.578 --> 15:29.493
- What kind of pen?

15:29.537 --> 15:31.626
- The kind that matches
the ink on the envelope

15:31.669 --> 15:33.976
that you left for the Feds.

15:35.717 --> 15:38.763
- We were really careful.
- Oh, yeah? How careful?

15:38.807 --> 15:40.287
- Gloves and masks--

15:40.330 --> 15:43.986
- 'Cause there's
lipstick on it.

15:44.030 --> 15:46.032
- So just, like, be me
for a second, okay?

15:46.075 --> 15:47.947
I'm looking
over the list, right?

15:47.990 --> 15:52.647
Picture my damn face when
I see that you were a hostage

15:52.690 --> 15:55.519
in the very robbery
that took down the gangbanger

15:55.563 --> 15:58.479
that you had a little,
you know, uh...

15:58.522 --> 15:59.828
- Playdate.

15:59.871 --> 16:01.525
- Playdate with.

16:01.569 --> 16:03.310
What a small world.

16:03.353 --> 16:05.747
- I buy a lot of milk.
- Is that right?

16:05.790 --> 16:07.662
- It would be weird
if I wasn't there.

16:07.705 --> 16:11.579
- Mrs. Boland, I would love
for you to stop by the station.

16:11.622 --> 16:13.668
- I already gave my statement.

16:13.711 --> 16:16.845
- You did, but now I need
your DNA sample.

16:19.543 --> 16:21.545
- I think I'd like you
to leave.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.984
- That's probably a good idea.

16:27.377 --> 16:29.336
- And I'm calling a lawyer.

16:29.379 --> 16:31.077
- Even better.

16:48.746 --> 16:49.965
- You're going to go in there,

16:50.009 --> 16:51.706
and you're going
to give them everything.

16:51.749 --> 16:53.882
- You want me
to turn myself in?

16:53.925 --> 16:56.102
- I'll go with you.
- Why?

16:56.145 --> 16:57.929
- Because the first in
gets the best deal.

16:57.973 --> 16:59.844
Baby, that's the way it works.

16:59.888 --> 17:03.544
We'll be--Babe,
they don't care about you.

17:03.587 --> 17:05.024
They just want that gang,
you know?

17:05.067 --> 17:06.721
They just want to build
their case, right?

17:06.764 --> 17:08.984
So you go in there,
you tell them everything.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.986
You hear me? All of it.

17:11.030 --> 17:14.598
You tell them what you did,
how you did it...

17:16.600 --> 17:20.039
And who you did it with.
- You mean Beth and Annie?

17:21.779 --> 17:24.086
- Babe, they got DNA.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.870
This is over.

17:25.914 --> 17:27.568
- Beth was my maid of honor.
- Look, nobody said

17:27.611 --> 17:29.004
this was going to be pretty
and fair, Ruby.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.136
- I used to babysit Annie.

17:30.179 --> 17:32.094
- Excuse me,
you made this bed.

17:32.138 --> 17:34.705
- Oh, my God.
- And you made it well.

17:34.749 --> 17:36.664
I mean, it's got pillows,
it's got throws,

17:36.707 --> 17:38.100
it's got duvets in it.

17:38.144 --> 17:39.928
- Oh, my God, Stan.
- But you--but you did it

17:39.971 --> 17:41.669
for us, though, right?

17:41.712 --> 17:43.497
You did it for--you did it
for me, you did it for Sara,

17:43.540 --> 17:44.846
you did it for Lil' Money.

17:44.889 --> 17:47.196
I mean, that's--
that's what you said, right?

17:50.025 --> 17:53.724
- Then you get out of it
for us.

17:59.556 --> 18:02.342
- I don't understand why you
would use your mouth

18:02.385 --> 18:04.213
to take off a pen cap.

18:04.257 --> 18:06.563
- Because I had a gun
on a bunch of people.

18:06.607 --> 18:08.043
My hands were full.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.654
- Yeah,
but it's just so amateur.

18:10.698 --> 18:13.527
- Yeah, we are amateurs.

18:13.570 --> 18:16.095
- Well, what does Stan say?

18:18.445 --> 18:21.665
- About what?
- About what we should do.

18:23.014 --> 18:24.494
- Nothing.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.019
- You guys, I got to go.

18:28.063 --> 18:29.630
- Now?

18:29.673 --> 18:32.154
- Yeah, I got a-a thing.

18:32.198 --> 18:34.156
- Oh, here...

18:34.200 --> 18:36.158
these are for Sara
for while she's laid up.

18:36.202 --> 18:38.291
- Oh, that's so sweet.

18:40.597 --> 18:42.599
- Yeah, I got
a little something, too.

18:42.643 --> 18:44.253
- Oh, please don't.

18:44.297 --> 18:46.125
- I made it from all
her old baby clothes--

18:46.168 --> 18:47.778
the ones you handed down.
- Wow.

18:47.822 --> 18:50.259
- And then I thought, "Wouldn't
it be cool if there were quotes

18:50.303 --> 18:52.174
from all her favorite authors?"
So I--

18:52.218 --> 18:55.003
- Who are you?
You can't just go to a store?

18:55.046 --> 18:58.049
- That's too much.
- It's not a kidney.

18:58.093 --> 18:59.747
- But, you know,
we would've done that, too.

18:59.790 --> 19:02.793
Thanks, guys.

some sort of courier service,

- Well, how do you know
it hasn't already been sent?

20:23.787 --> 20:25.789

send the evidence

20:25.833 --> 20:27.574
until they have something
to match it to.

20:27.617 --> 20:29.097

20:33.623 --> 20:35.277

that could've changed.

22:26.954 --> 22:29.260
a little bit
more excited about that.

22:31.262 --> 22:33.874

- Uh, why do two people
leave each other?

22:43.579 --> 22:45.538
- Well--You know,
I don't know, Greg.

22:45.581 --> 22:47.278
Why don't you tell me?

working out anymore.

22:49.019 --> 22:51.239
- No, no.
That cannot be it.

22:51.282 --> 22:53.720
- Why not?
- Because you got married.

22:53.763 --> 22:55.417
- Yeah, I--
- You--you have to have

22:55.461 --> 22:58.289
a very long list
of very good reasons why,

22:58.333 --> 23:00.379
and then, maybe only then,
can you--

23:00.422 --> 23:02.642
- Okay, what if--
what if you were on it?

23:02.685 --> 23:04.644
- On what?
- My list!

23:06.820 --> 23:08.299
- Am I?

23:08.343 --> 23:09.736
- Yeah.

23:09.779 --> 23:12.565
- Mom.

23:15.089 --> 23:16.438
- Um...

23:16.482 --> 23:18.048
You know,
you're such a dick!

23:18.092 --> 23:21.356
- What?
- You--you always do this.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.314
You--you never respect
my schedule!

23:23.358 --> 23:24.968
- Well, you know, maybe
if you actually kept

23:25.012 --> 23:26.448
some kind of schedule,

23:26.492 --> 23:29.277
then I would be able
to respect it.

23:29.320 --> 23:33.716
- You know, maybe if you
weren't such a D-bag loser--

23:33.760 --> 23:35.544
- What are you guys doing?

23:35.588 --> 23:37.894
- We didn't know you were home.
- Yeah.

23:37.938 --> 23:39.548
- Why was the door closed?

23:39.592 --> 23:41.550
- We just didn't want
to bother you.

23:41.594 --> 23:42.943
- You didn't know I was home.

23:42.986 --> 23:44.640
- We should watch a movie.
- Are you hungry?

23:44.684 --> 23:47.034
- I'm--I'm good.

23:47.077 --> 23:49.515
- See ya.
- Yeah.

23:53.823 --> 23:57.871
- So, um--so am I, like,
top of the list,

23:57.914 --> 24:00.656
or am I sort of more
in the middle?

24:00.700 --> 24:03.093
- Oh, you're, like...
an idiot.

24:03.137 --> 24:04.921
- Mm. Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

24:04.965 --> 24:08.795
- Hey, you know, honestly, it's
an honor just to be nominated.

24:15.541 --> 24:17.368
- Busy day?

24:17.412 --> 24:19.588
- I picked up Sara's homework.

24:19.632 --> 24:21.721
By the way,
I talked to Miss Allegra

24:21.764 --> 24:23.810
about the spring play again.

24:23.853 --> 24:25.638
She wants to do
"Lion King," fine,

24:25.681 --> 24:27.988
but I'll be damned if our son
is playing a shrub.

24:28.031 --> 24:31.078
- Hmm.
How's tomorrow looking?

24:31.121 --> 24:34.429
- Well, I have 300 doughnuts
to dip for Rotary Club.

24:34.473 --> 24:35.648
- Yeah, what about next month?

24:35.691 --> 24:38.520
- What?
- Next year?

24:38.564 --> 24:40.087
I don't know. You just
let me know when you think

24:40.130 --> 24:41.436
you're going to have a minute.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.046
- I went to the station.

24:43.090 --> 24:45.396
You know...

24:45.440 --> 24:47.660
armed robbery
is a Class A.

24:47.703 --> 24:49.879
- I tried.
I couldn't go in.

24:49.923 --> 24:52.534
- That's at least
four birthdays.

24:54.710 --> 24:58.105
Sara in March,
Harry in September.

24:59.889 --> 25:02.544
You add in felony firearm,
and that's, um...

25:04.198 --> 25:05.895
That's eight birthdays
you miss.

25:05.939 --> 25:08.811
- We used toy guns.
- You think they care?

25:08.855 --> 25:12.511
Plus, you did it twice,
so now we're up to 16.

25:12.554 --> 25:14.077
They pin you
on that counterfeit

25:14.121 --> 25:16.689
and, God forbid,
that kidnapping for the manager

25:16.732 --> 25:18.865
that you hid
in the tree house...

25:18.908 --> 25:22.564
that's--that's more birthdays
than I can count.

25:22.608 --> 25:25.088
I mean, Lil' Money's
going to be 50.

25:26.916 --> 25:28.570
You think on that

25:28.614 --> 25:30.529
when you're drinking rosé
with your besties.

25:30.572 --> 25:32.443
- Stan...

25:36.230 --> 25:38.754
Their kids
have birthdays, too.

25:58.295 --> 26:00.341
- Could you not?

26:02.125 --> 26:03.605
- I can't go to jail.

26:03.649 --> 26:06.086
- Yeah, me neither.

26:06.129 --> 26:09.045
- No, but I really can't.

26:09.089 --> 26:14.137
Things are finally starting
to not suck for me, you know?

26:16.749 --> 26:20.100
When's Deansie coming home?

26:20.143 --> 26:22.711
- Tomorrow.

26:22.755 --> 26:25.540
- What are you going
to say to him?

26:27.324 --> 26:29.413
Check it out. Two o'clock.

26:31.154 --> 26:33.679
- Have you ever seen a clock?

26:33.722 --> 26:36.290
- All right, awesome. Thank you
so much. Have a nice day.

26:36.333 --> 26:37.465
Next in line, please?

26:37.508 --> 26:40.729
- Ooh, that's me.

26:40.773 --> 26:42.644
Hi, how can I help you?

26:42.688 --> 26:44.515
- Hello, Jan.

26:44.559 --> 26:49.433
- Um, why don't you tell me
a little bit about your menu?

26:49.477 --> 26:50.957
- You said you knew
how to do this.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.480
- It's a delicate art,
all right?

26:52.523 --> 26:54.308
- Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

26:54.351 --> 26:58.486
- Every lock is different.
I work by feel.

26:58.529 --> 27:01.620
- I had no idea the myriad
of dairy techniques.

27:01.663 --> 27:04.013
So what
you're telling me is

27:04.057 --> 27:06.320
they froth the milk
for a cappuccino,

27:06.363 --> 27:09.497
but they steam it
for a latte.

27:09.540 --> 27:10.759
- More or less, yeah.

27:10.803 --> 27:13.109
- So wait.
So what's an espresso?

27:13.153 --> 27:15.198
- Just a really strong coffee.

27:15.242 --> 27:18.245
-  What will
those Italians think of next?

27:18.288 --> 27:20.682
You see--
you know what I'm saying?

27:20.726 --> 27:22.684
- All right.

27:29.299 --> 27:30.344
- Shh.

27:30.387 --> 27:32.433
- No, you shh!

27:32.476 --> 27:33.782
- It says draft,
and I thought that was--

27:33.826 --> 27:35.349
Did you think it was--
I really--

27:35.392 --> 27:37.133
I thought that was beer.
That's so funny.

27:37.177 --> 27:38.787
But it's just the cold brew.
The cold brew's new, right?

27:38.831 --> 27:40.484
- Do you want one?

27:40.528 --> 27:42.051
- Yes, I want something.

27:42.095 --> 27:46.534
I don't know
exactly what I--

27:46.577 --> 27:48.536
I'm sorry.
Are those teas back there?

27:48.579 --> 27:50.581
- Yep.
- Oh-ho!

27:50.625 --> 27:51.800
You just changed the game!

27:58.372 --> 28:01.114
- Why can't it just say
pen cap?

28:04.813 --> 28:06.336
- It seems
like everything's coded.

28:06.380 --> 28:07.773
I mean,
what are these numbers?

28:07.816 --> 28:09.078
- Do you take Apple Pay?

28:09.122 --> 28:10.645
- Yes.
- Amazing.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.212
Okay.

28:12.255 --> 28:14.562
Okay, now...

28:14.605 --> 28:17.043
how do I download that?

28:17.086 --> 28:19.393
- Oh, my God.
I will pay for you.

28:19.436 --> 28:22.265
- I mean,
why is there so much crime?

28:22.309 --> 28:23.745
- Okay, okay.

28:23.789 --> 28:26.269
Remember when we did that
23andMe thing a while back?

28:26.313 --> 28:29.229
- Yeah, wasn't Dean, like,
90% Neanderthal?

28:29.272 --> 28:31.753
- Ye--yes, but you had
to keep the swabs cold,

28:31.797 --> 28:34.277
or the DNA would, like,
immediately start breaking down

28:34.321 --> 28:36.410
and it wasn't viable.

28:36.453 --> 28:39.152
It is, like, 90 degrees
outside today.

28:39.195 --> 28:40.675
- Let's do it.

28:40.719 --> 28:41.807
- Next in line.

28:43.678 --> 28:46.594
- What can I get for you?
- Just a coffee.

28:48.204 --> 28:50.380
- I can't unplug it.

28:50.424 --> 28:52.643
- Oh, God. We have to go.
We have, like, 30 seconds.

28:52.687 --> 28:54.645
- I know, it won't--
- Beth, Beth, wait!

28:54.689 --> 28:56.125
- What?

28:58.214 --> 28:59.781
- Oh, my God.

28:59.825 --> 29:02.305
- I mean, they never actually
get around to these things.

29:02.349 --> 29:03.567
Right?

29:03.611 --> 29:05.221
- Oh, my God.

29:05.265 --> 29:06.875
- It's not like anybody
believes in science anymore.

29:06.919 --> 29:09.356
- Oh, my God!

29:11.837 --> 29:14.230
I got a breakfast thingy,
cheese plate,

29:14.274 --> 29:17.277
travel mugs,
a Maroon 5 Holiday CD,

29:17.320 --> 29:20.671
and Red Velvet Fraps.

29:20.715 --> 29:22.586
You got to try this thing.
It takes like--

29:22.630 --> 29:24.893
like a cake Slurpee.

29:24.937 --> 29:27.417
So what's up?
You get it?

29:29.593 --> 29:31.552
You got it, right?

29:33.510 --> 29:37.558
'Cause we're talking game over,
like, for real now, so...

29:43.520 --> 29:46.132
How could you not get it?

29:46.175 --> 29:48.787
- There were rape kits
in there.

29:54.357 --> 29:55.924
- I'm surprised you called.

29:55.968 --> 29:57.708
- Thanks for coming.
I couldn't find a sitter.

29:57.752 --> 30:01.234
- Oh, I drive anywhere
for cake.

30:01.277 --> 30:03.540
- This is a buckle.

30:03.584 --> 30:05.673
- Sorry?

30:05.716 --> 30:07.501
- See, a cake rises.

30:07.544 --> 30:11.853
With this, the fruit makes
the middle sort of buckle.

30:11.897 --> 30:14.725
If you wanted a crisp,
you would put streusel on top.

30:14.769 --> 30:16.858
And if you were making a
cobbler, you would use biscuit.

30:16.902 --> 30:18.381
If you wanted a Betty,
you would actually put--

30:18.425 --> 30:19.861
- I am good with cake.

30:24.735 --> 30:27.738
- My husband, um...

30:29.349 --> 30:30.872
We're going through
a lot right now.

30:30.916 --> 30:32.395
- Yeah,
I heard he got mugged.

30:32.439 --> 30:34.180
How'd that happen?

30:34.223 --> 30:35.834
- Wrong place,
wrong time.

30:35.877 --> 30:38.880
- That's the story
of your life.

30:40.316 --> 30:44.843
- I really need to focus
on my family right now, and...

30:44.886 --> 30:46.888
and I'm sure you have much
bigger fish to fry

30:46.932 --> 30:48.368
than a mother of four.

30:48.411 --> 30:51.284
- Oh, come on,
you are way more than that.

30:51.327 --> 30:54.896
No, I'm pretty boring.

30:54.940 --> 30:57.594
- What's boring about working
for a dangerous gang?

31:04.993 --> 31:07.778
It was never just a playdate,
was it?

31:14.350 --> 31:16.831
- I am so sorry.
- Mm.

31:16.875 --> 31:20.922
My mom used to say,
"Sorry don't cut it."

31:20.966 --> 31:25.927
- I am asking you to please
just let this one go.

31:28.799 --> 31:31.498
No can do..

31:31.541 --> 31:34.762
- What do you want? Do you
want to throw me in jail?

31:34.805 --> 31:36.416
- Hmm. Maybe.

31:36.459 --> 31:38.592
- Because I used a pen
in a grocery store.

31:38.635 --> 31:40.724
Oh, lock her up.

31:40.768 --> 31:42.378
You think a jury's going
to buy that?

31:42.422 --> 31:43.989
I've never even had
a speeding ticket.

31:44.032 --> 31:46.034
- You robbed a grocery store,
Mrs. Boland.

31:49.342 --> 31:51.518
- I did your job for you.

31:51.561 --> 31:52.911
- Excuse me?

31:52.954 --> 31:54.695
- I gave you a gift.

31:54.738 --> 31:58.438
I handed you that gang
with a big bow around it.

31:58.481 --> 32:00.396
You should be thanking me.

32:01.789 --> 32:03.660
And you know what my mama
used to say?

32:03.704 --> 32:05.358
- Hmm?

32:05.401 --> 32:07.664
- "You get what you get,
and you don't get upset."

32:07.708 --> 32:09.318
Now get out of my house.

32:18.675 --> 32:20.460
- No, I've already been--

32:20.503 --> 32:22.853
Hello?

32:22.897 --> 32:24.986
This bitch did not just
transfer me again.

32:25.030 --> 32:27.597
- Welcome to
Stars & Stripes Health Group.

32:27.641 --> 32:30.644
Let's get started. What can
I help you with today?

32:30.687 --> 32:32.951
- Speak to a representative.

32:32.994 --> 32:35.475
- I'll need more information
before I connect you

32:35.518 --> 32:37.999
with one of our trusted
health-care professionals.

32:38.043 --> 32:40.480
- Re-pre-sent-a-tive.

32:40.523 --> 32:42.090
- I'm sorry--
- They're trying to bill us

32:42.134 --> 32:44.310
for the anti-rejection meds,
which are supposed to be--

32:44.353 --> 32:47.052
Re-pre-sent-a-tive.

32:59.499 --> 33:03.590
- Good evening, this is Carl.
Who am I speaking with?

33:03.633 --> 33:06.375
Claims. Hello? Hello?

33:08.638 --> 33:13.121
- ♪ Kyrie eleison, down the
road that I must travel ♪

33:13.165 --> 33:18.605
♪ Kyrie eleison, through
the darkness of the night ♪

33:18.648 --> 33:24.045
♪ Kyrie eleison, where
I'm going will you follow? ♪

33:24.089 --> 33:29.181
♪ Kyrie eleison,
on a highway in the light ♪

33:32.227 --> 33:34.055
- Drink up.

33:37.189 --> 33:40.105
- What do you want from me?

33:40.148 --> 33:42.020
- You were right.

33:43.717 --> 33:47.068
- About what?
- About it all.

33:53.248 --> 33:55.207
- What is that?

33:57.426 --> 34:00.560
Come on, man.
Pull it together.

34:00.603 --> 34:03.084
Come on, Leslie. Leslie.

34:08.959 --> 34:11.571
It's just...

34:11.614 --> 34:13.486
It's been a really long road.

34:13.529 --> 34:17.577
- Yeah, okay. Okay, okay.
You're okay. Just breathe.

34:21.320 --> 34:23.409
- So listen, Leslie,

34:23.452 --> 34:27.239
I'm gonna take
these women down.

34:27.282 --> 34:29.589
- Yes. Yes!

34:31.199 --> 34:34.246
- Yeah, but I'm gonna need
your help, all right?

34:42.036 --> 34:45.126
What's in it for me?

34:45.170 --> 34:47.041
- Civic pride.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.435
- I was thinking more money.

34:49.478 --> 34:51.437
- Yeah, okay.

34:51.480 --> 34:53.178
Or I just arrest you.

34:55.484 --> 34:57.269
Yeah, right.
For what?

34:57.312 --> 34:59.097
- Oh, Leslie, you're trying to
tell me there's a store manager

34:59.140 --> 35:01.142
that doesn't know exactly
what's going in and out

35:01.186 --> 35:03.013
of his own safe?

35:05.059 --> 35:07.583
How much did they pay you
to look the other way?

35:10.195 --> 35:13.285
- I accept your terms.
- I thought you might.

35:17.158 --> 35:20.640
- Okay, I made
all your favorites...

35:20.683 --> 35:24.731
roast chicken,
potato casserole, apple pie.

35:24.774 --> 35:27.777
- It's 9:00 a.m.

35:27.821 --> 35:31.041
- I know, but I just thought,
you know...

35:31.085 --> 35:33.131
comfort food.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.312
I'm just gonna put it here.

35:41.748 --> 35:45.012
Did you see
what the kids made?

35:45.055 --> 35:46.666
They really wanted
to stay home from school,

35:46.709 --> 35:48.189
but I made them go.

35:48.233 --> 35:50.365
- What happened
to the stop sign?

35:51.584 --> 35:53.194
- I don't know.

35:53.238 --> 35:56.110
Probably some kid took it.

35:56.154 --> 36:00.767
- I've seen, like, five cars
just blow through it.

36:02.595 --> 36:04.814
Somebody's going to get hurt.

36:09.254 --> 36:11.560
- Dean, I--

36:17.436 --> 36:18.698
Do you want me
to turn on the TV?

36:18.741 --> 36:20.613
- Not right now.
- Okay.

36:20.656 --> 36:23.093
Let me know.
- Mm-hmm.

36:26.271 --> 36:28.229
- All right, all right,
all right, check this out.

36:28.273 --> 36:30.536
I've got an H
and an S here.

36:30.579 --> 36:32.233
Look at that.
- It looks more like an 8.

36:32.277 --> 36:33.669
- Yeah, 'cause the batter
ran over a little.

36:33.713 --> 36:35.628
So that's why--
- That looks like a snowman.

36:35.671 --> 36:37.543
- It kind
of looks like Grandma.

36:37.586 --> 36:39.414
- What?

36:39.458 --> 36:41.329
- Oh, that is your mother.

36:41.373 --> 36:43.853
- Ew, in that sundress,
right?

36:43.897 --> 36:46.552
- For sure.

36:46.595 --> 36:48.336
- You all better stop talking
about my mama.

36:48.380 --> 36:50.512
All right, fine. You know what?
I'm going to eat these.

36:50.556 --> 36:53.733
I'm gonna call her and tell her
you said that, Lil' Money.

36:55.213 --> 36:57.258
- Maybe
we can play cards later.

37:03.917 --> 37:06.441
- Thank you.

37:06.485 --> 37:07.877
- I did it for them.

37:14.188 --> 37:16.669
- Hi!
- Hi.

37:16.712 --> 37:18.845
- Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

37:18.888 --> 37:21.326
- What?
- I just--I've been--

37:21.369 --> 37:23.284
I've been thinking
a lot about this,

37:23.328 --> 37:26.722
and we should go skydiving.

37:26.766 --> 37:28.811
- Like, jump out of a plane?

37:28.855 --> 37:30.552
- No, like to the mall.

37:30.596 --> 37:32.598
You know they got those
big wind tube-y things,

37:32.641 --> 37:34.469
and you can just fly.

37:34.513 --> 37:36.384
- I have a secret.

37:36.428 --> 37:38.778
- What is it?
- I'm not supposed to tell.

37:38.821 --> 37:40.519
- Dude, come on.
Well, now you have to tell me.

37:40.562 --> 37:43.478
What is it?
- Nancy's pregs.

37:45.567 --> 37:46.699
- Wow.

37:46.742 --> 37:48.831
- She just found out
this morning.

37:50.572 --> 37:52.357
- Wow.

37:52.400 --> 37:53.880
- She was crying
and then laughing,

37:53.923 --> 37:55.708
and then she barfed
all over the counter.

37:55.751 --> 37:58.885
-  Wow!

38:00.365 --> 38:01.540
- It's good, right?

38:01.583 --> 38:03.803
They've been trying
a long time.

38:03.846 --> 38:06.240
- I mean...

38:06.284 --> 38:07.502
Wow.

38:07.546 --> 38:10.462
- You keep saying that.

38:10.505 --> 38:12.812
- Yeah, I'm just, uh...

38:12.855 --> 38:16.337
I'm just really happy
for them.

38:16.381 --> 38:18.644
- So...

38:18.687 --> 38:20.341
Do you want to go?

38:20.385 --> 38:23.344
- Where?
- To the mall. Skydiving.

38:23.388 --> 38:24.693
- To the mall!
- To the mall!

38:24.737 --> 38:27.696
- Skydiving!

38:29.655 --> 38:32.484
- Go away. I said I don't want
to talk to you.

38:32.527 --> 38:33.833
I'm going to call the cops.

38:33.876 --> 38:35.878
- Ask for my boy, Jimmy.

38:35.922 --> 38:37.358
He's the one investigating

38:37.402 --> 38:39.491
those bitches
you're in bed with.

38:39.534 --> 38:41.841
- How do you know that?

38:41.884 --> 38:44.234
- I'm his key witness.

38:46.585 --> 38:49.370
- Well, I don't know
anything, so...

38:49.414 --> 38:51.285
- Okay.

38:51.329 --> 38:53.243
- I mean, they kept me
out of it. I--

38:53.287 --> 38:56.464
- Well, good. I mean, 'cause
they're in real big trouble.

38:56.508 --> 38:58.901
- Like jail or--

39:00.729 --> 39:02.905
I'm just--

39:05.908 --> 39:07.954
- Did you take money
from them?

39:07.997 --> 39:10.260
- No.

39:12.872 --> 39:14.395
- Well, then you're cool.

39:18.051 --> 39:21.315
- I took a little--
I took a little money.

39:25.537 --> 39:27.626
- How much?

39:27.669 --> 39:29.497
- It wasn't not a lot.

39:29.541 --> 39:31.238
- Oh, Mary Pat.

39:31.281 --> 39:33.545
- But I have kids.
Leslie, I--

39:35.460 --> 39:37.679
I wish I could help you.
I do, uh--

39:37.723 --> 39:39.420
- Please. No, please don't
tell them about me.

39:39.464 --> 39:42.902
- I am going
to be under oath.

39:42.945 --> 39:46.427
You know, I got to tell
the truth, so help me God.

39:46.471 --> 39:48.690
- I can't go away
for this, Leslie.

39:48.734 --> 39:50.736
Please. I ca--
I mean, I ca--Please.

39:50.779 --> 39:52.433
Can you just leave me
out of it, and then--

39:52.477 --> 39:54.435
and then I can stay with--
with my boys?

39:54.479 --> 39:56.959
Please.
Please, Leslie, please.

39:57.003 --> 39:58.744
Please, please.

39:58.787 --> 40:01.442
- Okay, okay.

40:01.486 --> 40:03.792
- Okay.

40:03.836 --> 40:05.403
- Okay.

40:05.446 --> 40:07.883
-  Thank you.
Thank you.

40:13.715 --> 40:15.587
- What are you doing?

40:15.630 --> 40:18.590
- Well, a husband can't testify
against his wife.

40:21.506 --> 40:24.509
- Hey, don't forget
to order for everybody.

40:24.552 --> 40:26.772
- Oh, God.
K-Bear's in it for himself.

40:26.815 --> 40:28.774
- Order for your sisters!

40:28.817 --> 40:32.342
- Yeah,
and your favorite auntie!

40:32.386 --> 40:35.476
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-uh.

40:35.520 --> 40:36.999
- Really?

40:37.043 --> 40:39.611
- That's all the money.
- I gave him ten bucks.

40:39.654 --> 40:42.614
- Yo, what about my frog pop?
We had a deal!

40:44.572 --> 40:46.444
- That grifter got four scoops.

40:46.487 --> 40:48.620
- I'm telling you.
That kid's shady as hell.

40:48.663 --> 40:51.840
- We should go.

40:51.884 --> 40:54.843
- Nah, let the kid eat.

40:54.887 --> 40:56.845
What's up? You miss me?

40:58.586 --> 41:00.501
- No.

41:02.503 --> 41:05.375
- So crazy thing--
turns out...

41:05.419 --> 41:07.465
we got a mutual friend.

41:07.508 --> 41:08.814
That's you're homey, right?

41:08.857 --> 41:10.511
- No, he's not my homey.

41:10.555 --> 41:11.686
I don't know
why everybody keeps--

41:11.730 --> 41:13.993
- He's talking
to the Feds now...

41:14.036 --> 41:16.517
which could be bad
for all of us.

41:16.561 --> 41:18.998
So, yeah, I'm gonna need you
to take care of him.

41:20.869 --> 41:23.002
- That's insane.

41:23.045 --> 41:25.657
- Is it? Why?

41:25.700 --> 41:28.877
- Because we don't do that.
- Yeah, that's not what we do.

41:28.921 --> 41:30.662
- Besides,
don't you have anyone

41:30.705 --> 41:32.838
who's a little
more experienced

41:32.881 --> 41:34.840
in that particular arena?

41:34.883 --> 41:38.060
- Sure, but it ain't on him.
It's on you.

41:38.104 --> 41:40.759
- Daddy! You said five minutes.
- What's up, pop?

41:40.802 --> 41:42.587
You're right, no.
I did, I did.

41:42.630 --> 41:45.024
Hey, what's that thing I always
tell you when you make

41:45.067 --> 41:46.721
a big old mess?

41:46.765 --> 41:48.636
- That I got to clean it up.

41:48.680 --> 41:51.160
- That you got to clean it up.

41:53.728 --> 41:56.818
All right, come on.
No more grown-up talk.

41:56.862 --> 41:58.559
That's for you.

42:05.218 --> 42:07.568
- What is it?

42:07.612 --> 42:09.570
- What is it, Beth?
