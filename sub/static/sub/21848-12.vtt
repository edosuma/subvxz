40:37.135 --> 40:38.937
Okay.

40:38.970 --> 40:40.506
Promise?

40:40.539 --> 40:42.574
You're gonna
come visit, right?

40:42.608 --> 40:45.110
I promise.
I like Hershey.

40:45.143 --> 40:48.847
You've never been
to Hershey.
Lea's there.

40:48.880 --> 40:55.120
**

40:55.153 --> 40:57.856
Can I put
my arms around you?

40:57.889 --> 41:07.899
**

41:07.933 --> 41:12.203
**

41:12.237 --> 41:15.541
Are you
a good doctor?

41:15.574 --> 41:19.811
'Cause when I think of you,
I think you are.

41:19.845 --> 41:21.747
* You were alone

41:21.780 --> 41:24.149
* Left out in the cold

41:24.182 --> 41:28.587
* Clinging to the ruin
of your broken heart *

41:28.620 --> 41:32.290
* You were falling and lonely,
cry out *

41:32.323 --> 41:34.626
* Will you fix me up?

41:34.660 --> 41:37.295
* Will you show me hope?

41:37.328 --> 41:41.299
* At the end of the day,
you were helpless *

41:41.332 --> 41:43.635
* Can you keep me close?

41:43.669 --> 41:45.904
* Can you love me?
Remember, I said borrow.

41:45.937 --> 41:50.709
* I know how it feels
being by yourself in the rain *

41:50.742 --> 41:55.814
* We all need someone to stay

41:59.718 --> 42:03.254
* We all need someone to stay

42:03.288 --> 42:07.793
* Hear you, falling and lonely,
cry out *

42:07.826 --> 42:09.961
* Will you fix me up?

42:09.995 --> 42:12.731
* Will you show me hope?

42:12.764 --> 42:16.935
* At the end of the day,
you were helpless *

42:16.968 --> 42:19.137
* Can you keep me close?

42:19.170 --> 42:21.940
* Can you love me most?

42:21.973 --> 42:29.147
**

42:31.683 --> 42:39.725
**

42:39.758 --> 42:47.866
**

42:47.899 --> 42:55.941
**

42:55.974 --> 43:04.082
**
