He's digging it
in pretty short.

01:15.680 --> 01:17.520
But you should get
at least one bad ball.

Thank you, Captain.

02:17.840 --> 02:21.280
But I must, as ever,
remain impartial.

02:21.360 --> 02:25.160
Although saying no
looks like you are
favouring the opposition.

I'd better have a small rum.

03:27.920 --> 03:29.840
He went to get more beers.

03:29.920 --> 03:31.200
He didn't come back.

03:31.280 --> 03:33.600
Probably fall asleep
in the office.

Er, no, I came in early

I found this in

05:14.600 --> 05:16.320
I thought it would be
a good distraction.

Distraction? From what?

(SIGHS)

05:20.800 --> 05:22.760
From Martha.

Or rather the prospect
of her imminent departure
from Saint Marie.

05:25.960 --> 05:27.960
You haven't talked to her
about how you feel, then?

05:28.040 --> 05:31.520

be a holiday romance.

fell in love with her.

with his team and his family,
celebrating a notable victory.

Mr Martin was out here

06:50.960 --> 06:53.080
He went to get some beers
from the clubhouse office.

could find no other signs
of injury or assault.

HUMPHREY: Well,
it doesn't look
like a robbery, sir.

07:05.480 --> 07:08.040
Meaning there's
a decent chance
the victim knew his killer.

07:08.120 --> 07:09.880
Looks like he was shot
from over here, sir.

07:11.040 --> 07:12.360

07:12.440 --> 07:14.920
I'd say 9mm calibre.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.160
Supermax bullet.
Typically used with
automatic handguns.

07:19.240 --> 07:23.000

six metres away
from the victim.

were still here when
the body was found, sir?

07:37.360 --> 07:40.160

wait in the clubhouse.

Let's see what
they've got to say.

07:41.840 --> 07:44.400
Dwayne, JP, I'd like you
to search the office.

07:44.480 --> 07:47.320
Given the victim was heading
there shortly before
he was found dead,

07:47.400 --> 07:50.240
there may be some indication
as to why he ended
up out here instead.

07:50.320 --> 07:52.120
-Yes, sir.
-Erm, excuse me?

to get some air.

We need to ask
you a few questions.

Of course.

08:27.960 --> 08:31.240
I assume that Jerome played
in the match yesterday?

08:31.320 --> 08:35.440
It was a benefit game
to raise money for
Torey's medical treatment.

08:35.520 --> 08:36.880
Treatment?

08:36.960 --> 08:39.640
I had a car accident
about five months ago.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.920
Damaged my spinal cord.
That's why...

to raise money to send
Torey to America

08:45.120 --> 08:47.120

We hope he might be able
to walk again one day.

HUMPHREY: (STAMMERS) Yes.

08:52.480 --> 08:55.320
Er, so if you could just
run me through what exactly
happened this morning.

08:55.400 --> 08:57.960
The last time you saw
Mr Martin was, er...

08:58.040 --> 08:59.840
In the bar.
About 6:00.

08:59.920 --> 09:01.840
He headed to
the clubhouse office.

09:01.920 --> 09:03.320
We're running low on beers.

09:03.400 --> 09:04.720
I'll go get some.

09:04.800 --> 09:07.160
ARCHER: Then after a while,
we realised

09:07.240 --> 09:08.400
he hadn't come back.

09:08.480 --> 09:10.120
Gus said he'd go
and get Jerry.

09:10.200 --> 09:12.160
It was a quarter
past 6 by then...

09:12.240 --> 09:13.520
I remember checking my watch.

09:13.600 --> 09:15.280
I need to get my things.

09:15.360 --> 09:16.800
I'll go wake him up.

09:16.880 --> 09:18.560
And you came straight back
after finding Jerome?

09:18.640 --> 09:19.800
ARCHER:
As soon as I found him.

09:19.880 --> 09:21.880
-Call an ambulance!
-What is it?

09:23.240 --> 09:25.400
Jerry!

09:25.480 --> 09:28.080
I call the emergency service
straight away.

09:28.160 --> 09:30.960
Mr Browne's call
came in at 6:30.

09:31.040 --> 09:35.040
And before Mr Coleman
found the body,
none of you heard a gunshot?

09:35.120 --> 09:36.760
No.
We had music playing.

09:36.840 --> 09:38.400
And with the wind coming in
from the shore,

09:38.480 --> 09:40.760
sound gets carried
out on that pitch.

09:40.840 --> 09:43.040
Sorry, will you...
Will you excuse
us for a moment.

09:56.040 --> 09:57.400
Bullets.

09:57.480 --> 09:58.760
JP: With one missing.

09:58.840 --> 10:00.320
They were in the safe.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.480
It was already
unlocked when I tried it.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.320
JP: 9mm Supermax.

10:04.400 --> 10:05.600
It's a match.

10:08.440 --> 10:10.760
Anyone know what
these were doing in the safe?

10:14.400 --> 10:16.240
There should be
a gun in there too.

10:16.320 --> 10:18.280
Sorry. Why was there
a gun kept in the safe?

10:18.360 --> 10:20.360
GUS: It belonged to me.

10:20.440 --> 10:24.080
I left it there after this
place was broken into
a couple of years back.

10:24.160 --> 10:26.400
Jerry was here
when it happened.

10:26.480 --> 10:29.440
Shook him up.

10:29.520 --> 10:33.280
I thought having
a gun on the premises
might reassure him.

10:33.360 --> 10:34.600
So who knows the combination?

10:34.680 --> 10:35.840
Only the club committee.

10:35.920 --> 10:37.520
And who is on
the club committee?

10:37.600 --> 10:39.760
Well, I am, as captain.

10:39.840 --> 10:43.360
Sabrina's the social secretary
and Archer is the treasurer.

10:43.440 --> 10:44.680
Jerome was our chairman.

10:44.760 --> 10:45.960
Just you three, then?

10:49.320 --> 10:50.960
Dad told me the combination.

10:51.040 --> 10:53.200
I had to pick up
some club paperwork
for him once.

10:53.280 --> 10:56.720
So you four are
the only people who
had access to the gun?

11:01.800 --> 11:03.440
HUMPHREY: Now after Jerome
went to get some beers,

11:03.520 --> 11:05.600
during the 15 minutes
in which he was killed,

11:05.680 --> 11:07.080
where were you all?

11:07.160 --> 11:08.720
SABRINA: In the bar.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.240
HUMPHREY: No-one left?

11:10.320 --> 11:12.240
It's not a big room,
Inspector.

11:12.320 --> 11:14.120
We'd have noticed
if someone left it.

11:14.200 --> 11:17.040
Until Gus went to look for
Jerry, we were together
the whole time.

11:19.520 --> 11:20.680
Mr Coleman?

11:22.760 --> 11:25.960
As they say, we were
here the whole time.

11:30.240 --> 11:33.040
So only those
four people knew the
combination to the safe

11:33.120 --> 11:34.480
that contained the gun that,

11:34.560 --> 11:38.000
potentially, was used
to kill Jerome Martin.

11:38.080 --> 11:40.400
I think our killer
has to be one of
those four people

11:40.480 --> 11:42.040
currently outside this bar.

11:42.120 --> 11:43.720
FLORENCE: Except...
HUMPHREY: Yes. I know.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.640
They were all
in the clubhouse
when it happened.

11:45.720 --> 11:48.480
So if it was one of them,
how did they do it?

11:48.560 --> 11:51.080
Well, erm, that is
a very good question,
Florence.

11:51.160 --> 11:52.880
The answer to which
I do not know.

11:52.960 --> 11:55.320
So let's start
with the one
small thing we do know.

11:55.400 --> 11:57.520
All our four suspects
remained here at the club

11:57.600 --> 11:58.920
ever since
the murder occurred.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.800
So the gun must still
be somewhere hereabout.

12:00.880 --> 12:02.760
Dwayne, JP,
I want that weapon found.

12:02.840 --> 12:04.200
-Chief.
-Sir.

12:04.280 --> 12:05.480
HUMPHREY: Thank you.

12:05.560 --> 12:07.800
-Sir?
-HUMPHREY: Yes.

12:07.880 --> 12:10.160
FLORENCE:
Someone must've
been filming the party.

12:13.160 --> 12:14.960
Battery's dead.

12:15.040 --> 12:17.040
Oh, well let's get it back
to the station
and charge it up.

12:17.120 --> 12:19.560
You never know, maybe
it will shed some light
on this morning's events.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.120
-Inspector.
-Yes, sir?

12:23.200 --> 12:25.600
Tell me.
Do you play cricket?

12:25.680 --> 12:28.840
Uh, well, sir, I have
actually had a few
innings in my time.

12:28.920 --> 12:31.720
Yes, I once got
a battling seven not out,

12:31.800 --> 12:34.880
for the school under-14
third eleven
against Redbridge.

12:34.960 --> 12:38.160
I almost saved the draw, sir.

12:38.240 --> 12:43.280
Well, erm, here
in the Caribbean,
cricket is in our blood.

12:43.360 --> 12:47.120
Jerome Martin's murder will be
felt right across the island.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.320
I trust I can leave it
to you and the team

12:49.400 --> 12:53.480
to handle this with
the care and
respect it deserves.

12:53.560 --> 12:55.560
Yes, of course, sir.

12:55.640 --> 12:57.680
We won't let you down.

12:57.760 --> 12:59.120
Sir.

13:08.680 --> 13:10.320
Is it me or did
you sense that Gus

13:10.400 --> 13:12.640
was holding back a little
during questioning?

13:12.720 --> 13:15.720
Do you think maybe
he knows more
than he's letting on?

13:15.800 --> 13:17.160
Yes, I think maybe he does.

13:26.120 --> 13:27.280
Thank you for
your cooperation.

13:28.960 --> 13:30.560
So, Dwayne.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.640
Given that the gun
wasn't on any of our suspects,

13:32.720 --> 13:34.360
shall we start
our search in there

13:35.120 --> 13:36.480
or out here?

13:38.400 --> 13:40.160
-Dwayne?
-Eh?

13:40.240 --> 13:41.400
(STAMMERING) What? What?

13:41.480 --> 13:43.480
Where should we
start our search from?

13:43.560 --> 13:47.000
Well, it's either going to
be inside the clubhouse
or somewhere out here.

13:47.080 --> 13:48.640
I know.
I just said that.

13:48.720 --> 13:50.760
And what did you decide on?

13:50.840 --> 13:53.400
I didn't I was waiting to hear
what you thought.

13:53.480 --> 13:55.200
Well, you should've said.

13:55.280 --> 13:57.240
I'm not a mind reader,
you know, JP.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.960
Let's start over here.

14:02.120 --> 14:04.200
Come on.
Don't just stand there!

14:11.760 --> 14:12.720
(SIGHS)

14:14.160 --> 14:16.000
Right then, Florence.

14:16.080 --> 14:18.400
Ah, yes...

14:18.480 --> 14:20.200
Let's go through
what we know so far.

14:20.280 --> 14:21.960
Erm, so...

14:22.040 --> 14:25.800
Jerome Martin,
45, geography teacher.

14:25.880 --> 14:28.880
Member of
the Honore Cricket Club
for nearly 30 years

14:28.960 --> 14:31.040
and chairman for the last ten.

14:31.120 --> 14:35.280
Found dead at 6:15
this morning in the middle
of Honore cricket pitch

14:35.360 --> 14:37.040
having been shot in the heart.

14:37.120 --> 14:38.560
Which leads us
to our suspects.

14:38.640 --> 14:40.280
Er, I think we should start
with the victim's wife.

14:40.360 --> 14:41.960
Sabrina Martin.

14:42.040 --> 14:44.560
FLORENCE:
She and Jerome had been
married over 20 years.

14:44.640 --> 14:47.240
Since Torey's crash,
she's been trying
to raise money

14:47.320 --> 14:48.920
to send him to
the States for treatment.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.640
Yes, not a cheap endeavour.

14:50.720 --> 14:52.280
Er, which means we have
to ask the question,

14:52.360 --> 14:54.200
does she benefit financially
from her husband's death?

14:54.280 --> 14:57.240
Which brings us to
their son, Torey.

14:57.320 --> 14:58.680
Er...

14:58.760 --> 15:02.840
Yeah, erm, just turned 18,
I believe, erm...

15:04.440 --> 15:07.160
(SIGHS) Yes, yes,
just turned 18,

15:07.240 --> 15:10.800
seems to have been
quite the cricketing talent.

15:10.880 --> 15:15.040
Five months ago was
signed by a professional
club in Dominica.

15:15.120 --> 15:17.200
A week later,
on his way to
a friend's house,

15:17.280 --> 15:18.800
he drove his car into a tree.

15:18.880 --> 15:20.960
Erm, and what of the, er,
club's treasurer?

15:21.040 --> 15:22.200
Archer Browne.

15:22.280 --> 15:24.760
Well, sir.
He is 30 years old.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.720
Owns a garage
down by the harbour.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.120
Family business.

15:28.200 --> 15:30.400
Took it over from his father.

15:30.480 --> 15:33.360
Gus Coleman
also works there
as a mechanic.

15:33.440 --> 15:34.640
Ah, yes.

15:34.720 --> 15:36.480
Gus Coleman.
Same age as the victim.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.760
Seems to be an old friend,
they went to school together.

15:38.840 --> 15:42.480
Never married.
Club captain for
the last five years.

15:42.560 --> 15:44.200
So, question one.

15:44.280 --> 15:46.080
Just how did the killer

15:46.160 --> 15:48.320
manage to shoot
Jerome Martin in the middle
of a cricket pitch

15:48.400 --> 15:51.240
when all of our suspects
were in the clubhouse
at the time it happened?

15:51.320 --> 15:52.960
And question two,

15:53.040 --> 15:54.920
-why did he have to die?
-FLORENCE: Sir.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.160
I think you should
take a look at this.

15:57.240 --> 15:58.480
Yes.
(CLEARS THROAT)

16:00.960 --> 16:02.760
It's from 3:15 this morning.

16:02.840 --> 16:05.640
The camera was left on record
when it was put on the bar.

16:06.920 --> 16:08.680
(INAUDIBLE)

16:10.120 --> 16:12.240
Torey seems very angry.

16:12.320 --> 16:13.880
HUMPHREY:
Yes, doesn't he just.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.520
Good afternoon.
Sorry to interrupt.

16:26.160 --> 16:28.840
Torey, can we have a word?

16:28.920 --> 16:31.080
-Sure.
-I'll be inside
if you need me.

16:35.680 --> 16:36.960
You know, that was Dad and me.

16:40.720 --> 16:44.560
We played out there
every day after school.

16:44.640 --> 16:46.760
He must've been made up
when you made professional.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.440
(CHUCKLES) When I
signed my contract,

16:48.520 --> 16:50.760
he told me he was
the proudest man
in the world.

16:52.920 --> 16:55.280
How'd you been
getting on more recently?

16:55.360 --> 16:56.600
Yeah, good.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.000
Why?

17:00.080 --> 17:02.440
We know you argued
with your father last night.

17:02.520 --> 17:04.080
Who told you that?

17:04.160 --> 17:06.760
There was a camera
left recording at the bar.

17:06.840 --> 17:10.200
Shows your rather
heated exchange.

17:10.280 --> 17:14.360
Yesterday, being back
at the club for the
first time, it was tough.

17:14.440 --> 17:17.560
Last time I was there,
I was one of the players.

17:17.640 --> 17:20.920
Not a spectator
sat at the boundary.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.280
I was trying to tell Dad
how hard I was finding it,
but he wasn't listening.

17:26.440 --> 17:27.800
TOREY:
You been drinking again?

17:27.880 --> 17:29.280
You know I'm sorry
about what happened, yeah?

17:29.360 --> 17:30.920
-Stop apologising!
-If I could take it back...

17:31.000 --> 17:32.320
-Why you apologising?
-I'm sorry.

17:32.400 --> 17:35.160
Leave me alone!
Just leave me alone!

17:35.240 --> 17:37.040
Why was he apologising?

17:37.120 --> 17:39.400
Ever since the crash,
he blamed himself
for what happened.

17:41.640 --> 17:45.080
And when he's
had a few drinks,
it all starts coming out.

17:45.160 --> 17:48.200
Saying if anybody
deserves to be
in a wheelchair it was him

17:48.280 --> 17:50.880
and he'd swap places
with me in a heartbeat.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.520
Last night I just snapped.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.960
How could your dad think
it was his fault you crashed?

17:55.040 --> 17:57.280
The car was
a present from him,
for turning pro.

17:57.360 --> 17:59.320
And after the crash,
the insurance people found out

17:59.400 --> 18:00.880
that the MOT was out of date.

18:00.960 --> 18:02.480
But Dad often used to
just forget stuff like that.

18:02.560 --> 18:04.360
So was your accident
caused by a mechanical fault?

18:04.440 --> 18:06.080
No!

18:06.160 --> 18:07.720
I crashed the car
because I was
driving too fast.

18:07.800 --> 18:08.960
But there was nothing
wrong with the car.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.080
You know the last
thing I said to him?

18:15.440 --> 18:17.000
"Leave me alone."

18:23.840 --> 18:27.000
You OK, son? Come on,
try to eat something.

18:30.640 --> 18:33.000
Ah, er...
So you're... You're back.

18:33.080 --> 18:35.400
How did you chaps
get on searching for the gun?

18:35.480 --> 18:37.360
Er, no sign of it
I'm afraid, Chief.

18:37.440 --> 18:39.520
Yes, we covered
every inch of that place.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.760
-Inside and out.
-That's very troubling.

18:41.840 --> 18:43.800
That's very troubling indeed.

18:43.880 --> 18:45.400
Because now not
only do we not know

18:45.480 --> 18:47.960
how our murderer managed
to kill Jerome Martin,

18:48.040 --> 18:49.720
but we also don't know
how they then

18:49.800 --> 18:53.480
managed to make
the gun disappear
after they'd done it.

18:53.560 --> 18:56.280
Right, look.
It's getting late.
We should call it a day.

18:56.360 --> 18:59.080
Er, but in the morning,
Florence, I'd like you to
chase up that crash report.

18:59.160 --> 19:00.840
-Yes, sir.
-Dwayne. JP.

19:00.920 --> 19:02.760
Financial checks
on the victim
and all the suspects.

19:02.840 --> 19:04.840
And find out about
the victim's will
and whether

19:04.920 --> 19:06.920
-any life insurance
had been taken out.
-Yes, Chief.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.720
And we should also find out
about his phone records
and e-mail account.

19:11.160 --> 19:12.920
Chief?

19:13.000 --> 19:14.200
HUMPHREY: There was
someone doing
something by the Jeep.

19:15.680 --> 19:17.400
(INDISTINCT TALKING)

19:18.080 --> 19:19.320
(SIGHS)

19:19.400 --> 19:21.320
Looked like the bonnet
was up, I'm sure of it.

19:22.560 --> 19:24.360
(SIGHS)

19:27.320 --> 19:29.120
Right, erm...

19:29.200 --> 19:30.840
Yes, er...

19:30.920 --> 19:32.560
You sure you know
what you're
looking at there, Chief?

19:32.640 --> 19:35.120
Yes, yes, I think
I know my spark plugs
from my, er...

19:35.200 --> 19:36.880
My seat belts. Erm...

19:36.960 --> 19:39.040
Er, why would someone
have our bonnet up?

19:39.120 --> 19:40.840
Should I check if
anyone saw anything?

19:40.920 --> 19:43.000
Yes, thank you, JP.
What is that?

19:44.800 --> 19:46.640
I think someone's
been messing with this engine.

19:46.720 --> 19:48.680
You want me to have a look,
see if everything's in order?

19:48.760 --> 19:50.160
Yes, Dwayne, thank you.

19:50.240 --> 19:53.280
I think perhaps you should.

19:56.680 --> 19:59.200
It might be wise
to phone a cab
to get home tonight

19:59.280 --> 20:01.120
with the Jeep
out of commission.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.080
Martha's cooking dinner,
I would hate to
put her timings out.

20:04.160 --> 20:06.440
Probably not a bad idea.

20:06.520 --> 20:09.880
Do you think you might
talk to Martha tonight
about, you know...

20:09.960 --> 20:11.920
(STAMMERING)
I don't know, Florence.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.120
I mean I would hate to
spoil what little time
we have left together

20:14.200 --> 20:16.440
by telling Martha that
I've fallen in love with her.

20:16.520 --> 20:18.440
Only for her to tell me
she doesn't feel the same.

20:18.520 --> 20:20.440
-Er...
-Maybe she does
feel the same?

20:20.520 --> 20:22.880
Yes. Maybe she does.
But then again, maybe
she doesn't, you know.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.720
Maybe she can't wait
to get back on
that plane to London.

20:25.480 --> 20:27.320
Sir?

20:27.400 --> 20:30.360
One of the stall-holders
did notice a guy briefly
over by the Jeep.

20:30.440 --> 20:32.520
Said he was
wearing blue overalls.

20:32.600 --> 20:34.920
She said she just assumed
that he was fixing the Jeep.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.400
How odd! (SIGHS)

20:37.560 --> 20:38.960
How odd!

20:42.400 --> 20:45.280
(LAUGHING) OK, I'll see you
in a couple of days, then.

20:45.360 --> 20:47.400
(LAUGHS) Bye.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.200
-Hello.
-Hello.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.880
-Good day?
-Yeah.

20:55.960 --> 20:57.600
That was Alistair
from the restaurant.

20:57.680 --> 20:59.960
He's nearly ready
for the big opening next week.

21:00.040 --> 21:03.120
He was just taking me
through the menu,
it sounds amazing.

21:03.200 --> 21:05.040
That's fantastic.

21:05.120 --> 21:06.800
You know, I thought this
was just another job
I was going back to.

21:06.880 --> 21:09.160
But I think I might
really enjoy it.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.280
Sounds like a cause
for celebration.

21:12.360 --> 21:13.960
-Fancy a beer?
-Yes, please.

21:19.880 --> 21:21.120

What's that, Catherine?

21:33.200 --> 21:34.400
The beers you ordered.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.440
But?

21:45.360 --> 21:46.320
(SIGHS)

21:47.440 --> 21:48.520
It's Dwayne.

21:50.680 --> 21:52.640
This morning we were
at the cricket ground

21:52.720 --> 21:55.560
and he just seemed
a bit distracted,
if I'm to be honest with you.

22:00.000 --> 22:04.760
Dwayne's father walked out
on him and his family
when he was a just a boy.

22:04.840 --> 22:08.280
I think he must've only
been six when it happened.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.080
-Really?
-Mmm.

22:10.160 --> 22:13.120
I don't think they've
heard from him since.

22:13.200 --> 22:15.160
He used to take
Dwayne to the cricket.

22:15.240 --> 22:17.840
Maybe it brought
back some memories
he'd rather forget.

22:28.320 --> 22:29.800
-Good morning.
-Morning, Chief.

22:29.880 --> 22:31.200
-Morning, sir.
-Everything OK, sir?

22:31.280 --> 22:32.880
Er, yes.
Fine, thank you, Florence.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.320
Absolutely fine.

22:36.320 --> 22:37.520
(CLEARS THROAT)

22:37.600 --> 22:39.200
So, er, how...
How we all getting on?

22:39.280 --> 22:42.040
Well, sir. The post-mortem
has come through and confirms

22:42.120 --> 22:45.080
that Jerome died
between 6:00 a.m.
and 7:00 a.m.

22:45.160 --> 22:46.760
from a single bullet
to the heart.

22:46.840 --> 22:48.200
The lab has also confirmed

22:48.280 --> 22:50.840
a definite match
between the fatal bullet

22:50.920 --> 22:52.960
and the pack of bullets
we found in the safe.

22:53.040 --> 22:55.720
OK, er, any joy with
the prints on the pack?

22:55.800 --> 22:58.080
Er, we got some partials
but no more, sir.

22:58.160 --> 23:02.400
Also, the report on
Torey Martin's crash
came through first thing.

23:02.480 --> 23:04.360
Er, yes, what did it say?

23:04.440 --> 23:07.920
"In summary,
there is no evidence
of any mechanical malfunction

23:08.000 --> 23:10.240
"that might have
led to this crash.

23:10.320 --> 23:12.400
"Verdict, reckless driving."

23:12.480 --> 23:14.600
So Torey was right.
There was nothing
wrong with the car.

23:14.680 --> 23:15.840
It appears not.

23:15.920 --> 23:17.800
OK. What else
have we got?

23:17.880 --> 23:19.960
DWAYNE: Me and JP have
been going through
all the financial checks.

23:20.040 --> 23:21.720
In the last three months

23:21.800 --> 23:24.560
Jerome has taken out
5,000 Eastern
Caribbean Dollars

23:24.640 --> 23:27.120
-in cash, every week.
-Every week?

23:27.200 --> 23:30.640
The withdrawals stopped
eight days ago when the
account went into overdraft.

23:30.720 --> 23:33.000
-That's over
60,000 EC Dollars!
-Mmm-hmm.

23:33.080 --> 23:35.120
JP: On top of which,
I checked whether Mr Martin

23:35.200 --> 23:37.680
-had taken out
a life insurance policy.
-And?

23:37.760 --> 23:40.840
He did.
According to the policy,
with her husband dead,

23:40.920 --> 23:47.120
Mrs Martin looks set to
receive 120,000 Eastern
Caribbean Dollars.

23:47.200 --> 23:50.680
I don't know about you,
but that sounds
like motive to me.

23:58.120 --> 24:00.440
-The cricket club
owed two years rent.
-Hmm.

24:00.520 --> 24:02.640
The council were threatening
to take the ground back.

24:02.720 --> 24:04.400
Jerry was paying off the debt.

24:04.480 --> 24:05.640
Is that what he told you?

24:06.960 --> 24:08.960
Yes.

24:09.040 --> 24:12.200
Mrs Martin,
these withdrawals
were made in cash.

24:12.280 --> 24:14.600
I find it very hard to believe
Honore town council

24:14.680 --> 24:19.280
were accepting rent arrears
of that size paid in cash.

24:19.360 --> 24:22.520
Well, then it seems I don't
know what my husband
was doing with our money.

24:22.600 --> 24:25.560
But whatever it was,
you can't have
been happy about it.

24:25.640 --> 24:28.400
Not when you're trying to
save to pay for Torey's
medical treatment.

24:28.480 --> 24:32.160
Of course I wasn't
happy about it.
I was furious.

24:32.240 --> 24:34.400
I put every penny
I'd earned into that account.

24:34.480 --> 24:36.400
So what'd you do
when you found out
your husband had spent it?

24:37.520 --> 24:39.080
I lost it with him.

24:40.200 --> 24:41.880
I threw plates.

24:41.960 --> 24:43.920
Made him sleep in the car.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.040
We've been putting on
a brave face for Torey

24:46.120 --> 24:47.760
but we hadn't
even been talking
the last few days.

24:47.840 --> 24:49.320
But it doesn't bring
the money back,
though, does it?

24:49.400 --> 24:50.960
Doesn't pay for
Torey's treatment?

24:52.720 --> 24:54.040
I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

24:54.120 --> 24:56.200
Jerome had life insurance.

24:56.280 --> 24:58.800
And as a result of
his death yesterday,

24:58.880 --> 25:02.080
you are now set to receive
substantial pay-out.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.480
To the tune of $120,000.

25:06.360 --> 25:07.840
That hadn't even
crossed my mind.

25:11.880 --> 25:15.680
I admit I would
do anything for
my son, Inspector.

25:15.760 --> 25:18.480
But I also loved
my husband a great deal.

25:18.560 --> 25:21.000
Despite everything he'd done.

25:21.080 --> 25:24.160
If you're saying that
I killed Jerry because
I wanted the money

25:24.240 --> 25:26.960
then you've got it
very, very wrong.

25:29.520 --> 25:31.480
HUMPHREY:
Well, we'll leave it there.

25:31.560 --> 25:34.040
Thank you for your time,
Mrs Martin.
We'll, er, see ourselves out.

25:38.320 --> 25:40.680
Inspector! Wait!

25:41.600 --> 25:43.240
Mr Coleman.

25:43.320 --> 25:44.800
You're here again.

25:44.880 --> 25:47.960
You were asking Sabrina
about her and Jerry's savings.

25:49.080 --> 25:50.760
Go on.

25:50.840 --> 25:54.200
Jerry used to
drop by the garage
on his lunch break.

25:54.280 --> 25:57.200
His school was
round the corner.

25:57.280 --> 26:00.560
After Torey's crash
he came round less.

26:00.640 --> 26:02.720
He was a lot more
withdrawn in general.

26:03.760 --> 26:06.800
But I noticed with Archer,

26:06.880 --> 26:10.280
there was this different vibe.

26:10.360 --> 26:13.840
Something almost hostile.

26:13.920 --> 26:16.720
A week ago, Jerry stopped by.

26:16.800 --> 26:20.680
While he was there,
I saw him hand Archer
an envelope of cash.

26:20.760 --> 26:24.440
They didn't know
I'd seen it happen.

26:24.520 --> 26:27.400
Jerry didn't seem happy
about handing over the money.

26:30.360 --> 26:32.720
-Did you ask them
what it was about?
-No.

26:32.800 --> 26:36.720
I was going to talk to Jerry
after the match. But...

26:38.160 --> 26:39.880
(CLEARS THROAT)
Can you think of any reason

26:39.960 --> 26:42.040
why Jerome was
giving Archer money?

26:42.120 --> 26:44.680
I've tried.
Believe me.

26:44.760 --> 26:46.400
Was Archer in
any money trouble?

26:47.360 --> 26:48.800
I know he likes a gamble.

26:48.880 --> 26:50.960
HUMPHREY:
Did he tell you
how he was doing?

26:51.040 --> 26:52.640
You only ever hear

26:52.720 --> 26:53.640
-about the winnings,
don't you?
-(MOBILE RINGING)

26:53.720 --> 26:54.640
-(CHUCKLES)
-It's JP.

26:54.720 --> 26:56.280
I better take this.

26:56.360 --> 26:58.240
You'd known
Mr Martin a long time,
hadn't you?

26:58.320 --> 26:59.720
We were like brothers.

27:01.160 --> 27:02.840
I would have done
anything for him.

27:05.600 --> 27:06.840
Thank you, Mr Coleman.

27:12.360 --> 27:14.320
FLORENCE:
We should head back
to the station, sir.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.160
JP and Dwayne have
got something for us.

27:16.240 --> 27:17.200
Very good.

27:18.800 --> 27:20.600
DWAYNE: So, Chief,
we checked Jerome's e-mails

27:20.680 --> 27:22.480
like you asked us.
And we found this
one from two days ago.

27:22.560 --> 27:24.480
Yes, sir,
Jerome hadn't
actually sent it.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.520
It was in his
draft inbox folder.

27:26.600 --> 27:28.120
(HUMPHREY READING)

27:30.600 --> 27:32.760
Addressed to Archer Browne.

27:32.840 --> 27:34.840
What mistake, I wonder?

27:34.920 --> 27:39.080
And why would Jerome
give money to Archer instead
of helping his son?

27:39.160 --> 27:41.640
-Blackmail?
-That would make sense.

27:41.720 --> 27:44.480
Archer was
blackmailing Jerome
over a mistake.

27:44.560 --> 27:45.880
So what was it?

27:45.960 --> 27:47.280
HUMPHREY: I have an idea.

27:47.360 --> 27:49.000
Torey told us

27:49.080 --> 27:50.960
that Jerome kept apologising
for the crash being his fault.

27:51.040 --> 27:52.720
What if that was
Jerome's mistake?

27:52.800 --> 27:54.440
What if there really
was something wrong
with the car

27:54.520 --> 27:56.320
that Jerome gave Torey?

27:56.400 --> 28:00.040
That crash report,
who signed off on
the expert assessment?

28:00.120 --> 28:01.400
I don't know.
I didn't check.

28:04.320 --> 28:06.160
Here...

28:06.240 --> 28:07.600
Browne's Repairs.

28:07.680 --> 28:10.640
That was Archer's garage
that checked the car.

28:10.720 --> 28:12.120
He signed off on it himself.

28:23.840 --> 28:25.240
Mr Browne,
can we have a word?

28:29.080 --> 28:30.280
Sure.

28:30.360 --> 28:31.720
(SIGHS)

28:31.800 --> 28:33.400
Tell us,
why was Jerome
giving you money?

28:35.200 --> 28:37.640
All right.
I've got debts.

28:37.720 --> 28:39.240
From gambling.

28:39.320 --> 28:41.960
Jerome offered to bail me out.
He was a good friend.

28:42.040 --> 28:44.800
Here, we found this e-mail
in Jerome's draft inbox.

28:44.880 --> 28:46.520
It's addressed to you.

28:46.600 --> 28:47.880
Would you be so
good to read it?

28:54.400 --> 28:56.200
-What's all that about, then?
-I really don't know.

28:56.280 --> 28:58.920
Your garage carries out
assessments of vehicles

28:59.000 --> 29:01.680
involved in crashes
on Saint Marie.

29:01.760 --> 29:04.280
You looked at
Torey Martin's car
after the accident.

29:06.520 --> 29:08.480
Yes. Yes, we did.

29:08.560 --> 29:09.960
-It was sound.
-Was it?

29:10.040 --> 29:12.360
Yes. Honestly.

29:12.440 --> 29:14.600
We think that
perhaps when you
examined Torey's car,

29:14.680 --> 29:16.560
you found a mechanical
fault of some sort.

29:16.640 --> 29:18.800
An MOT would have
flagged up the problem.

29:18.880 --> 29:21.360
As we know,
Jerome never
got round to that.

29:21.440 --> 29:23.960
So we can only
imagine Jerome's guilt
when you revealed to him

29:24.040 --> 29:27.080
that it was his own negligence
that caused Torey's tragedy.

29:27.160 --> 29:29.400
And being
the loving family man
that he was,

29:29.480 --> 29:32.520
he would've been desperate
to keep this a secret
from Torey and Sabrina.

29:32.600 --> 29:34.320
But something changed,
didn't it?

29:34.400 --> 29:36.680
Told you he wasn't
gonna pay any more.

29:36.760 --> 29:39.240
Maybe he was gonna come clean.
Maybe even go to the police.

29:39.320 --> 29:40.360
Which is why you
think I'd kill him?

29:41.800 --> 29:46.480
It is an interesting theory,
Inspector.

29:46.560 --> 29:48.920
But there is one
thing wrong with it.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.560
I wasn't the only one
to check that car over.

29:52.640 --> 29:54.480
Gus Coleman
assessed it with me

29:54.560 --> 29:56.960
the very same night
it came into the garage.

29:57.040 --> 30:00.440
And the insurance company
sent someone over.

30:00.520 --> 30:02.840
So speak to them
if you think I'm lying
when I tell you

30:04.360 --> 30:06.120
there was nothing wrong
with that vehicle.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.040
Florence.

30:14.120 --> 30:16.200
Do you like the colour
of Mr Browne's overalls?

30:16.280 --> 30:18.080
FLORENCE: Sorry, sir?

30:18.160 --> 30:20.480
Well, don't you think
they're a lovely
shade of, er, blue?

30:20.560 --> 30:22.360
Oh, yes, sir.

30:22.440 --> 30:25.080
A particularly
lovely shade of blue.

30:29.040 --> 30:30.520
How'd you do this, then?

30:31.480 --> 30:33.040
I don't know, man.

30:33.120 --> 30:35.120
It probably
caught on an engine
or something.

30:35.200 --> 30:37.120
Did it, now?
Yeah. Thanks for your time.

30:40.600 --> 30:43.600
HUMPHREY: Archer Browne
is Jerome's killer,
I'm sure of it.

30:43.680 --> 30:46.880
The fact that his torn overall
matches the material
that we found in the Jeep

30:46.960 --> 30:49.240
means that he was the one
who was messing
with our engine.

30:49.320 --> 30:51.080
But the engine
was working fine.

30:51.160 --> 30:52.800
So what was he doing there?

30:52.880 --> 30:54.360
Yes, well, I think
I might have
that one worked out.

30:54.440 --> 30:56.680
Try this on
for size if you will.

30:56.760 --> 30:59.320
We never found the gun
at the cricket ground, did we?

30:59.400 --> 31:02.640
But as we know,
all four suspects
remained there

31:02.720 --> 31:04.720
in between Jerome being
killed and us arriving.

31:04.800 --> 31:07.720
So where did the gun vanish?

31:07.800 --> 31:11.040
Where's the one place
that never gets checked
at a crime scene?

31:11.120 --> 31:12.360
(LAUGHS)

31:12.440 --> 31:13.520
A police car.

31:15.160 --> 31:17.160
-Archer hid
the gun in our engine?
-Exactly.

31:17.240 --> 31:19.720
And then ripped his overalls
when he came to
collect it later that day.

31:19.800 --> 31:22.040
Man alive,
that takes a big pair of...

31:22.120 --> 31:24.040
Thank you, Dwayne.

31:24.120 --> 31:26.680
Sir, the insurance
company confirmed
they looked at Torey's car.

31:26.760 --> 31:28.520
-And?
-It's as Archer said.

31:28.600 --> 31:30.400
Nothing wrong
with it whatsoever.

31:30.480 --> 31:32.320
(INHALES SHARPLY)

31:32.400 --> 31:34.480
All the evidence
points to Archer
blackmailing Jerome Martin.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.640
We just don't know
what he was
blackmailing him over.

31:36.720 --> 31:37.880
No, we don't.

31:37.960 --> 31:39.720
That gun could be
anywhere by now.

31:39.800 --> 31:41.640
Dwayne, JP,
I want you to
tail Archer Browne.

31:41.720 --> 31:43.480
-We're on it, Chief.
-He's hidden it somewhere.

31:43.560 --> 31:44.840
Maybe he'll show us.

31:54.400 --> 31:57.480
Listen, if you want
I can cover this bit
on my own, you know,

31:57.560 --> 31:59.320
and you can go off to
Martha's leaving drinks

31:59.400 --> 32:01.440
'cause I know you
wanted to be there.

32:01.520 --> 32:04.200
No, no, that's good of you,
Dwayne. But I'm happy
to be here with you.

32:04.280 --> 32:05.680
-You sure?
-Yes!

32:05.760 --> 32:08.560
Put on the bet.
I'm good for it.
You know that.

32:08.640 --> 32:10.040
You know that!

32:10.800 --> 32:13.000
Yes, I.

32:13.080 --> 32:15.840
(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

32:18.120 --> 32:21.520
(CONTINUES
TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

32:21.600 --> 32:24.840
So as I was saying,
you know, we are partners,

32:24.920 --> 32:26.520
and we do things
with each other.

32:26.600 --> 32:28.440
We help each other out.

32:28.520 --> 32:32.000
You know,
sometimes we might even
share things with each other,

32:32.080 --> 32:34.280
like facts about ourselves,
that kind of thing.

32:34.360 --> 32:37.040
Whatever you say, JP.
Whatever you say.

32:42.040 --> 32:46.040
Which means Dwayne
and JP are stuck on
this stakeout, unfortunately.

32:46.120 --> 32:47.640
So it'll be just
the four of us.

32:47.720 --> 32:48.960
-Five.
-Five?

32:49.040 --> 32:50.760
-SELWYN: Evening!
-Oh, God.

32:50.840 --> 32:53.360
-Commissioner.
-Inspector.

32:53.440 --> 32:56.240
Yeah, I bumped into
Selwyn this morning
and said he should join us.

32:56.320 --> 32:59.920
I brought this.
Saint Marie's finest,
25 years old.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.520
Great, thank you.
(CHUCKLES)

33:01.600 --> 33:03.320
Er, there's, er, drinks
on the, er, veranda.

33:03.400 --> 33:04.760
Please help yourself, sir.

33:09.400 --> 33:10.880
(SIGHS)

33:11.520 --> 33:13.040
Excellent.

33:15.640 --> 33:17.960
It was a bit unfortunate,
bumping into him.

33:18.040 --> 33:19.960
Put you on the spot, did he?

33:20.040 --> 33:23.160
Oh, no. I couldn't leave
Saint Marie without saying
goodbye to Selwyn.

33:23.240 --> 33:25.080
He's one of my
best friends here.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.080
Really?

33:32.680 --> 33:34.000
I'm feeling a bit peckish.

33:38.120 --> 33:40.000
-Sandwich?
-No.

33:43.240 --> 33:44.680
OK, JP.
What's the problem?

33:44.760 --> 33:46.400
(SCOFFS) I don't know
what you mean.

33:46.480 --> 33:47.840
An hour ago,
I couldn't shut you up

33:47.920 --> 33:49.600
going on about how
we was partners and stuff.

33:49.680 --> 33:51.160
And now you
won't even grace me

33:51.240 --> 33:53.080
with a "No, thank you"
when I offer you a sandwich.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.680
So come on.
What's up?

33:55.840 --> 33:57.400
(SIGHS)

33:57.480 --> 33:59.360
Catherine told me
about your dad.

33:59.440 --> 34:01.560
-My dad?
-JP: Yes!

34:01.640 --> 34:03.600
What happened
when you were six.

34:03.680 --> 34:07.560
This really big thing
about your past,
and I had no idea about it.

34:07.640 --> 34:10.480
Now, I'm your partner.
Your friend.

34:10.560 --> 34:12.520
I... I should know
that about you, Dwayne.

34:12.600 --> 34:14.000
And that's why you're sulking?

34:14.080 --> 34:15.200
I'm not sulking.

34:15.280 --> 34:16.400
-You are!
-No, I'm not.

34:19.960 --> 34:21.640
(SIGHS)

34:21.720 --> 34:23.800
You know what, JP?

34:23.880 --> 34:26.120
You're right.
I should've told you about it.

34:27.840 --> 34:30.240
Sorry I didn't.

34:30.320 --> 34:32.600
I guess I just
liked you being
the one friend I have

34:32.680 --> 34:34.920
who didn't know
anything about it.
You know?

34:37.360 --> 34:38.760
A special friend.

34:45.680 --> 34:48.960
Well, you know what,

34:49.040 --> 34:52.240
I'll forget everything
I know about your dad.

34:52.320 --> 34:55.280
Yes, I'll...
I'll just un-know it.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.520
We can go back to
the way things were.

34:58.560 --> 34:59.960
Our special friendship.

35:12.680 --> 35:15.880
Apparently they
really hit it off
at JP's wedding.

35:15.960 --> 35:18.240
They sometimes meet
for coffee in Honore.

35:18.320 --> 35:19.840
Who knew?

35:19.920 --> 35:21.640
FLORENCE: Well, they're not
drinking coffee tonight.

35:21.720 --> 35:24.000
They're halfway through
the bottle already.

35:24.080 --> 35:27.800
I think perhaps
I should go
and rescue her.

35:27.880 --> 35:28.960
Mmm.

35:29.040 --> 35:30.840
(LAUGHS)

35:30.920 --> 35:33.040
(BOTH TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

35:35.160 --> 35:38.240
So. How are things?

35:38.320 --> 35:39.760
Well, I think
I've got my answer.

35:39.840 --> 35:41.880
-Really?
-Yeah.

35:41.960 --> 35:45.240
Seems like Martha's heart
is very much in London,
rather than Saint Marie.

35:46.360 --> 35:48.080
I'm sorry, sir.

35:48.160 --> 35:50.560
Well... At least now I know.

35:53.720 --> 35:55.760
-(CHUCKLES) Humphrey.
-Yes?

35:55.840 --> 35:58.280
Selwyn's just been telling me
about his dancing.

35:58.360 --> 35:59.480
His dancing?

35:59.560 --> 36:01.360
Yeah, apparently
he's really rather good.

36:01.440 --> 36:03.000
Really?

36:03.080 --> 36:05.160
And it made me realise
that we've never
danced together.

36:05.240 --> 36:06.640
Well, yes.
(STAMMERING)
I suppose we haven't.

36:06.720 --> 36:10.320
So I think
we should have
our first dance

36:10.400 --> 36:11.960
on our last night.

36:12.040 --> 36:14.240
Yeah, the thing is...
(STAMMERING) I mean...

36:14.320 --> 36:15.440
-Yeah.
-I'm not really...

36:15.520 --> 36:18.160
Dancing... Yes...
Er...

36:28.280 --> 36:31.160
I think maybe we should
leave them alone.

36:33.240 --> 36:34.920
Let's just slip out this way.

36:47.640 --> 36:49.360
(BOTH SIGH)

36:50.320 --> 36:51.280
Erm...

36:53.040 --> 36:55.440
-Oh.
-Yes.

36:55.520 --> 36:57.000
Have you been
drinking my rum?

36:57.880 --> 36:59.480
(CHORTLES)

36:59.560 --> 37:01.080
Why are you smiling?

37:02.440 --> 37:03.880
You make me smile.

37:07.720 --> 37:08.960
(SIGHS)

37:12.360 --> 37:14.080
-Humphrey?
-Yes.

37:16.320 --> 37:17.680
How do you feel about me?

37:19.080 --> 37:20.280
Sorry?

37:21.200 --> 37:22.640
You never tell me.

37:24.320 --> 37:28.000
Well, I never tell you
about how I feel.

37:29.480 --> 37:33.880
But, if I'm honest,

37:33.960 --> 37:37.440
there are things
that I want to tell you.

37:39.480 --> 37:41.360
But I don't know
whether you

37:43.360 --> 37:44.640
want to hear them.

37:50.720 --> 37:52.160
Well...

37:54.160 --> 37:55.440
I mean...

37:57.480 --> 37:59.720
There are some things
that I want to say.

38:03.440 --> 38:05.840
I... I wasn't
sure how you'd react.

38:09.760 --> 38:11.880
And... And I don't
know how you feel,

38:13.040 --> 38:16.680
but, well, I...

38:18.080 --> 38:19.040
I think...

38:21.360 --> 38:23.040
No, I don't think, I...
I know.

38:26.800 --> 38:28.960
I'm in love with you
and I don't want you to go,

38:31.440 --> 38:32.400
basically.

38:36.640 --> 38:38.000
Mar?

38:41.080 --> 38:42.400
Martha?

38:45.800 --> 38:46.920
(SIGHS)

38:59.680 --> 39:01.120

Wake up!

39:01.200 --> 39:02.240
-He's on the move!

39:44.400 --> 39:46.720

got in that toolbox?

39:50.320 --> 39:51.600
(WATER SPLASHES)

39:51.680 --> 39:53.000
I'm watching where it landed.

39:58.400 --> 39:59.440
Still watching.

40:08.480 --> 40:09.960
Quickly. Let's go.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.440
OK, JP, in you go.

40:23.520 --> 40:25.080
-Me?
-Yes, you!

40:25.160 --> 40:26.480
I'm watching the spot.

40:27.480 --> 40:28.440
Oh...

40:35.440 --> 40:36.880
Get in there, JP!

40:36.960 --> 40:39.120
-OK!
-My eyes are burning! Get in!

40:41.840 --> 40:43.640
Ooh! Ooh! Oh!

40:43.720 --> 40:45.800
Oh, oh, oh!
Ooh, ooh!

40:46.720 --> 40:47.800
Forward! Forward!

40:49.600 --> 40:51.120
Keep going.

40:51.200 --> 40:52.680
-Left a bit.
-(JP GROANING)

Right there where you are, JP!

40:55.280 --> 40:57.640
Here? (STAMMERING) OK!

41:00.080 --> 41:01.720
Oh, come on, JP.

41:13.320 --> 41:14.640
Yes I!

41:17.400 --> 41:18.640
Yes I!

41:27.280 --> 41:28.920
Good morning.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.680
I don't think
I feel very well.

41:30.760 --> 41:32.200
Right.

41:32.280 --> 41:33.400
(SIGHS)

41:35.440 --> 41:36.680
Thank you.

41:39.520 --> 41:41.280
(GROANS)

41:41.360 --> 41:42.600
Did we dance last night?

41:42.680 --> 41:43.960
-Yes, we did.
-(LAUGHS)

41:44.040 --> 41:45.320

41:45.400 --> 41:47.040
Don't you remember?

41:47.120 --> 41:48.600
-Vaguely.
-Oh.

41:48.680 --> 41:51.200
-I remember Selwyn
opening some rum.
-Mmm.

41:51.280 --> 41:52.600
It's all a bit
hazy after that.

41:52.680 --> 41:53.760
-(LAUGHS)
-(GROANS)

41:55.360 --> 41:57.200
What about our conversation?

41:58.240 --> 42:00.040
No.

42:00.120 --> 42:02.720
Why, what were we saying?

42:02.800 --> 42:05.480
(STAMMERING)
Well, the, erm...

42:05.560 --> 42:08.480
The gist of it seemed
to be that you
thought that I didn't...

42:08.560 --> 42:09.680
-(HORN HONKING)
-Oh!

42:09.760 --> 42:10.720
Oh, no.

42:13.520 --> 42:15.360
Chief!

42:15.440 --> 42:17.160
You've got to come,
we've had a breakthrough.

42:17.240 --> 42:19.280
HUMPHREY: What, now?
DWAYNE: Yes, Chief. Now.

42:19.360 --> 42:20.920
Madam.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.920
HUMPHREY:
Your flight's at 2:00, right?

42:23.000 --> 42:25.120
I'll be back in time to
take you to the airport.
We need to talk.

42:25.200 --> 42:26.840
-But...
-I'll be back by 1:00,
I promise.

42:26.920 --> 42:28.440
OK.

42:28.520 --> 42:29.720
I'll see you later.

42:29.800 --> 42:31.160
Bye.

42:33.680 --> 42:36.040
-(HUMPHREY CLEARS THROAT)
-ARCHER: What is it?

42:37.880 --> 42:39.080
Recognise this?

42:40.600 --> 42:42.240
(GROANS)

42:42.320 --> 42:44.080
Everything points to
Archer being our killer.

42:44.160 --> 42:46.520
The gun, the money
he was taking from
Jerome, the e-mail.

42:46.600 --> 42:48.880
But how did he
manage to kill Jerome
out on the cricket pitch

42:48.960 --> 42:50.800
when there are
three witnesses
who can alibi him

42:50.880 --> 42:52.760
as being inside
the clubhouse
when it happened?

42:52.840 --> 42:54.680
OK, Chief.
Archer's in the cell.

42:54.760 --> 42:56.400
Let me know
when you want
to talk to him.

42:56.480 --> 42:58.880
Thank you, Dwayne.
It might be
a little while yet.

42:58.960 --> 43:01.320
I'm afraid everything's
a little jumbled
in my head at the moment.

43:01.400 --> 43:02.400
(CHUCKLES)

43:02.480 --> 43:03.720
A bit like this, really.

43:03.800 --> 43:05.720
DWAYNE: Oh, just do
the old shortcut!

43:05.800 --> 43:07.560
Take it apart,
then put it
back together again

43:07.640 --> 43:09.320
with all the colours
in the right place.

43:09.400 --> 43:10.960
No-one will ever
know the difference.

43:11.040 --> 43:13.080
Is that a shortcut
or is that cheating?

43:13.160 --> 43:15.360
You say pot-ah-to,
I say potato.

43:17.960 --> 43:19.400
Dwayne.
What did you say?

43:19.480 --> 43:20.920
-You say potato, I say...
-No, no. Before that.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.880
-The shortcut thing.
-DWAYNE: Oh.

43:22.960 --> 43:25.920
That you take it apart
and put it back together
the way you want it.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.960
Dwayne,
you're absolutely right.
Of course that's what you do.

43:28.040 --> 43:29.480
And no one would ever know.

43:31.320 --> 43:32.640
Jerry, wake...

43:34.960 --> 43:36.160
Excuse me?

43:38.320 --> 43:41.200
I saw him hand Archer
an envelope of cash.

43:41.280 --> 43:45.200
Jerry didn't seem happy
about handing over the money.

43:45.280 --> 43:47.000
I would have done
anything for him.

43:47.880 --> 43:49.680
Oh, very clever, Gus.

43:49.760 --> 43:51.200
Very clever, indeed.

43:51.280 --> 43:53.160
But why?

43:53.240 --> 43:54.680
What is it you know
that we don't?

43:59.280 --> 44:01.840
Of course!
That's what you know!

44:01.920 --> 44:04.480
Dwayne. JP. I need you
to get to Gus Coleman's house.

44:04.560 --> 44:06.560
-Yes, Chief.
-(STAMMERING)
What are we looking for?

44:06.640 --> 44:08.360
A blue hooded jacket.

44:08.440 --> 44:10.320
JP!

44:10.400 --> 44:12.200
Florence, kindly ask the
Commissioner to meet us
at the cricket ground.

44:12.280 --> 44:14.400
-It's time for us
to do our thing.
-Yes, sir.

44:14.960 --> 44:15.920
(LAUGHS)

44:17.360 --> 44:18.640
(GASPS)

44:24.200 --> 44:27.160
HUMPHREY: (CLEARS THROAT)
Thank you all for coming.

44:31.080 --> 44:35.680
You know, at
the heart of Jerome's death
lay a number of questions.

44:35.760 --> 44:37.880
Let me clear
the first one up for you.

44:37.960 --> 44:42.160
Why did Jerome end up
out on the cricket pitch

44:42.240 --> 44:45.160
when he was supposedly
going to get some more
beers from the office?

44:48.040 --> 44:51.720
Because Jerome never
had any intention
of getting any beers.

44:51.800 --> 44:54.280
The wicket was
always his
primary destination.

44:55.920 --> 44:58.680
Now, the second problem is,
how did the killer

44:58.760 --> 45:00.520
manage to leave
the clubhouse bar unnoticed,

45:00.600 --> 45:04.080
when you were all
there together at the time
Jerome was shot?

45:05.720 --> 45:07.120
Well, as it turns out,

45:08.400 --> 45:10.120
you did see his
killer leave the bar.

45:12.320 --> 45:14.240
And I think you know
exactly who it was,

45:16.080 --> 45:17.240
don't you, Gus?

45:18.200 --> 45:19.640
Sorry?

45:19.720 --> 45:21.600
Because you've been
leading us round the houses

45:21.680 --> 45:24.560
since the moment you
discovered Jerome's body
out here on the pitch.

45:24.640 --> 45:26.360
I don't know what
you're talking about.

45:26.440 --> 45:28.200
HUMPHREY: I must say
you've done
a very good job of it.

45:28.280 --> 45:30.720
I mean, only an hour ago
we arrested Archer for murder.

45:30.800 --> 45:32.400
That's how sure we
were that it was him.

45:33.480 --> 45:35.280
But it wasn't him, was it?

45:35.360 --> 45:38.200
Archer didn't fire the gun
that killed Jerome.

45:38.760 --> 45:40.080
Did he?

45:41.560 --> 45:43.040
Please tell me
it wasn't you, Gus.

45:47.600 --> 45:48.880
No.

45:51.160 --> 45:54.000
Gus didn't kill Jerome,
either.

45:54.080 --> 45:57.520
I'm sorry to
have to tell you,
Mrs Martin, Torey,

45:59.520 --> 46:01.040
that Jerome took his own life.

46:02.880 --> 46:05.200
He fired the gun.

46:05.280 --> 46:07.680
At 6:00 a.m., having told you
he was getting some beers...

46:07.760 --> 46:09.920
We're running low on beers.
I'll go get some.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.280
HUMPHREY:
Jerome went into the office.

46:12.360 --> 46:14.200
He opened the safe.

46:14.280 --> 46:16.640
And took out
the gun and one bullet.

46:16.720 --> 46:19.640
Then walked out
into the middle of
the cricket square,

46:19.720 --> 46:22.200
loaded the gun,
and shot himself in the heart.

46:22.280 --> 46:23.240
(GUNSHOT)

46:24.240 --> 46:25.560
SABRINA: Why?

46:25.640 --> 46:27.640
Why would Jerry kill himself?

46:27.720 --> 46:31.880
Because Mr Browne here
was blackmailing him.

46:31.960 --> 46:34.880
That's where all
your savings had gone
the last few months.

46:36.880 --> 46:38.000
Blackmailing him?

46:38.720 --> 46:40.320
Over what?

46:40.400 --> 46:43.200
Jerome believed
he was responsible
for your accident.

46:43.280 --> 46:46.120
That the car had
a mechanical fault.

46:46.200 --> 46:48.920
And because he forgot
to get the MOT done,

46:49.000 --> 46:51.920
he was to blame for you
ending up in a wheelchair.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.640
But the crash report proved
that wasn't the case.

46:53.720 --> 46:55.040
There was nothing
wrong with the car.

46:55.120 --> 46:57.200
HUMPHREY:
Except Jerome believed

46:57.280 --> 47:01.920
the car wreck had been
doctored and the crash report
consequently falsified.

47:02.000 --> 47:03.160
Didn't he, Mr Browne?

47:05.520 --> 47:07.400
See, with gambling
debts mounting,

47:07.480 --> 47:11.160
and realising that Jerome
hadn't put the vehicle
in for its yearly MOT,

47:11.240 --> 47:13.600
you saw an opportunity
to make some quick money.

47:16.120 --> 47:20.040
The night the car wreck
arrived at Archer's
garage for assessment,

47:20.120 --> 47:22.480
you and Gus checked it
and there was
nothing wrong with it.

47:22.560 --> 47:25.480
"There is no evidence of any
mechanical malfunction

47:25.560 --> 47:27.360
"that might have
led to this crash."

47:28.400 --> 47:30.600
I think you then realised that

47:30.680 --> 47:33.480
if you were canny
and could speak to Jerome
before Gus did,

47:33.560 --> 47:37.160
you could convince
Mr Martin that there
was a fault with the car

47:37.240 --> 47:41.240
and that he was responsible
for Torey's accident.

47:41.320 --> 47:44.320
And knowing how much
that Jerome cared for Torey,

47:44.400 --> 47:47.000
Archer knew he would
do anything to
keep you finding out.

47:47.080 --> 47:50.720
So we assume Archer
went to see Jerome
that same night.

47:50.800 --> 47:55.240
He lied to him and said
the brakes were faulty.

47:55.320 --> 47:59.360
He also said that
no-one else had
looked at them.

47:59.440 --> 48:02.480
Archer told Jerome
he could fix
the faulty brakes

48:02.560 --> 48:04.920
and make the problem go away.

48:05.000 --> 48:10.080
So that by the time
anyone else saw the car,
they would be none the wiser.

48:10.160 --> 48:16.840
All on the condition Jerome
agreed to pay $5,000
a week to buy his silence.

48:16.920 --> 48:18.640
HUMPHREY: So Jerome paid up.

48:18.720 --> 48:22.400
Week in, week out,
till there was
nothing left to pay.

48:22.480 --> 48:25.680
Which is when, with
the prospect of Archer
finally revealing the truth,

48:25.760 --> 48:27.200
and already racked
with the guilt

48:27.280 --> 48:29.160
of what he thought
he'd done to his own son,

48:31.760 --> 48:33.240
Jerome decided to
take his own life.

48:34.720 --> 48:37.480
An act based on a lie.

48:37.560 --> 48:41.120
A lie that you,
Mr Browne, perpetrated.

48:41.200 --> 48:43.920
SELWYN:
But if this was suicide,

48:44.000 --> 48:46.080
why did it look so
much like murder?

48:46.160 --> 48:49.440
Er, well, sir,
because someone
decided to confuse us

48:49.520 --> 48:51.680
and stage Jerome's death
to look like murder.

48:51.760 --> 48:52.880
Didn't they, Gus?

48:55.080 --> 48:57.640
Because the truth is,
when you found Jerome,

48:57.720 --> 49:00.720
there were two items
you removed from
the crime scene.

49:00.800 --> 49:02.600
Jerry, wake...

49:02.680 --> 49:04.000
HUMPHREY:
The first was the gun.

49:06.360 --> 49:09.040
There was something else
you found as well,
wasn't there?

49:12.000 --> 49:14.960
There was a suicide note.

49:15.040 --> 49:18.880
See, when I realised what
had gone on, that this
wasn't murder but suicide,

49:18.960 --> 49:21.080
the one missing
piece of the jigsaw

49:21.160 --> 49:24.640
was how you knew exactly why
Jerome had killed himself.

49:24.720 --> 49:26.320
Jerome was
a man of conscience.

49:26.400 --> 49:27.880
It was unlikely
that he'd carry out
an act like this

49:27.960 --> 49:29.920
without some
sort of explanation.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.680
So where was the suicide note?

49:31.760 --> 49:33.480
And then I remembered...

49:33.560 --> 49:35.360
When you were searched
before leaving
the cricket ground,

49:35.440 --> 49:37.880
you had a folded
piece of paper on you.

49:37.960 --> 49:40.880
You knew we'd be looking
for the gun and would
pay no attention to it.

49:40.960 --> 49:44.000
But I think that document
was the other
piece of evidence

49:44.080 --> 49:46.240
pointing to the truth
of what Jerome did.

49:49.120 --> 49:50.760
This is the jacket you
were wearing
that morning, Gus.

50:11.920 --> 50:13.760
TOREY: "My beloved Torey.

50:13.840 --> 50:16.960
"You are my
most precious thing
in this world.

50:19.600 --> 50:22.840
"That's why my
heart is breaking
each time I look at you.

50:26.120 --> 50:29.680
"Your accident was my fault.

50:29.760 --> 50:33.120
"The brakes failed
because I... I didn't
get them checked.

50:36.240 --> 50:39.400
"Archer knows the truth.

50:39.480 --> 50:42.240
"I can't bear going on knowing
what I've done to you.

50:42.320 --> 50:47.280
"And knowing you will
find out, I can't face life
with you blaming me.

50:51.080 --> 50:53.680
"Goodbye, son.
All my love, Dad."

50:58.680 --> 51:00.400
HUMPHREY:
So when you found
that note and read it,

51:00.480 --> 51:03.400
I think you realised
exactly what had gone on.

51:03.480 --> 51:05.640
We know that
you'd seen Jerome
passing Archer cash

51:05.720 --> 51:09.440
so it would have been easy
for you to join the dots.

51:09.520 --> 51:11.960
And because you'd
also taken a look
at the wreck of Torey's car,

51:12.040 --> 51:13.960
you knew the brakes
were working fine.

51:15.560 --> 51:17.560
That Archer had
sold Jerome a lie

51:17.640 --> 51:20.440
and that's why he was
lying in front of you, dead.

51:20.520 --> 51:23.760
As you stood over the body
of your oldest friend,
angry, enraged,

51:23.840 --> 51:26.800
you resolved to avenge
his senseless death.

51:26.880 --> 51:29.840
And I think you decided
in that brief moment

51:29.920 --> 51:33.720
that you would do all you can
to make it look like Archer
had murdered Jerome.

51:36.520 --> 51:38.360
He as good as did.

51:38.440 --> 51:41.880
So you removed the
two pieces of evidence
pointing to suicide

51:41.960 --> 51:43.120
from the crime scene.

51:43.200 --> 51:45.200
You then moved
the shell casing

51:45.280 --> 51:47.320
to convince us
the shot had been fired
from a few metres away.

51:47.400 --> 51:49.440
You then seized your moment

51:49.520 --> 51:53.200
as we were out by Jerome's
body to stash the gun
in the police Jeep,

51:53.280 --> 51:57.640
knowing it would be the
last place where we would
look for the gun.

51:57.720 --> 52:00.400
That's why we
found you loitering by
the clubhouse that morning.

52:00.480 --> 52:02.680
You later planned your moment
to retrieve the gun.

52:02.760 --> 52:05.440
And as you did you
planted some material
from Archer's overalls,

52:05.520 --> 52:08.400
leaving the bonnet ajar
to make sure we'd find it.

52:10.040 --> 52:12.240
And having done all that,

52:12.320 --> 52:15.080
the final nail in Archer's
coffin. You planted
the gun in Archer's flat.

52:16.360 --> 52:17.760
I mean as it was,

52:17.840 --> 52:19.560
Archer came across it
first and panicked.

52:19.640 --> 52:21.240
Tried to get rid of it.

52:21.320 --> 52:23.080
But because you'd primed us
to think he was our man,

52:23.160 --> 52:24.960
we were already there waiting
to catch him in the act.

52:25.040 --> 52:26.720
I'm watching where it landed.

52:26.800 --> 52:28.480
At which point we arrested
Archer for murder.

52:30.120 --> 52:31.560
Your plan had worked.

52:31.640 --> 52:33.440
Except.

52:33.520 --> 52:36.360
We still didn't know
how he could've done it.

52:36.440 --> 52:40.240
The only flaw in your plan
was that Archer,
just like the rest of you,

52:40.320 --> 52:42.360
had a rock solid alibi
for the time of the murder.

52:42.440 --> 52:44.960
Simply because
there was no murder.

52:45.040 --> 52:46.600
You were all in the clubhouse

52:48.360 --> 52:50.680
when Jerome took his own life.

52:50.760 --> 52:52.200
So what happens now?

52:52.280 --> 52:54.280
Is he going to
get away with this?

52:54.360 --> 52:57.600
HUMPHREY: I'm sorry,
Mrs Martin, but we can't
arrest Mr Browne for murder.

52:57.680 --> 52:59.560
Even though his actions

52:59.640 --> 53:03.360
were directly
responsible for Jerome
sadly taking his own life.

53:03.440 --> 53:05.160
But he will be charged
with blackmail.

53:05.240 --> 53:06.840
Perverting
the course of justice.

53:06.920 --> 53:09.400
Manslaughter, maybe.

53:09.480 --> 53:11.920
I imagine when it's
put before a judge,

53:12.000 --> 53:14.880
the sentence handed down
won't be far off
that given for murder.
