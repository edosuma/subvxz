WEBVTT

00:05.506 --> 00:11.752
I mean, really, is there anything as
sweet as melty, melty cheese!

00:11.846 --> 00:13.086
What are you doing?
Do we have plans?

00:13.181 --> 00:16.093
--Do l have time to get changed?
--I have plans.

00:16.184 --> 00:17.594
l have a doctor's appointment tonight.

00:17.685 --> 00:20.677
In a push-up bra and
sexy boots at this hour?

00:20.771 --> 00:25.185
Um, newsflash--| don't
think they're a real doctor.

00:25.276 --> 00:28.268
Ha, ha, ha. It is with Lauren, knob.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.774
And I'm taking a test tonight.
What do you think of this one?

00:30.865 --> 00:35.780
Not low enough. You need more boob-ola.
You gotta let the girls breathe.

00:35.870 --> 00:38.782
So, what kind of a test is this,
like a sex test?

00:38.873 --> 00:41.785
She going to grade you
on your luscious curves?

00:41.876 --> 00:46.540
Actually, it's pretty important.
Sort of like a succubus midterm.

00:46.631 --> 00:48.713
Lauren's taking me out
for a night on the town.

00:48.799 --> 00:51.711
She wants to see if I've learned
full control in the real world yet.

00:51.802 --> 00:52.962
What's with the fashion panic?

00:53.054 --> 00:54.635
| just... I want to look nice.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.713
For the test, or for Lauren?

00:56.807 --> 01:00.345
'Cause I'm sensing some date jitters
and I know you like the ladies.

01:00.436 --> 01:06.397
It is definitely, definitely not a
date. | just frickin' hate tests.

01:06.484 --> 01:08.475
I'm better with multiple
orgasm than multiple choice.

01:08.569 --> 01:09.684
Mwah-ha-haa.

01:09.779 --> 01:12.316
But you're right. I just need to chill.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.988
I mean, there'll be no
disasters on the menu tonight,

01:15.076 --> 01:17.567
just drinks, maybe dinner.

01:17.662 --> 01:19.869
What could possibly
go wrong with that?

01:57.785 --> 02:02.745
[stomach rumbling]

02:09.005 --> 02:12.589
[screaming]

02:14.051 --> 02:17.043
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

02:17.138 --> 02:20.050
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

02:20.141 --> 02:23.053
My love carries a death sentence.

02:23.144 --> 02:25.135
l was lost for years,

02:25.229 --> 02:27.891
searching, while hiding,

02:27.982 --> 02:32.100
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

02:32.194 --> 02:37.109
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

02:48.419 --> 02:51.536
Mmm. Ugh.

02:53.257 --> 02:56.920
I'm just saying the beauty of your
kind is how elegantly they've evolved.

02:57.011 --> 03:01.971
I mean, sometimes things that seem
so fantastic are actually quite simple.

03:02.058 --> 03:03.264
Did you just call me simple?

03:03.351 --> 03:04.181
You know what I mean.

03:04.268 --> 03:08.011
Yeah. I wouldn't exactly call my
old 10-year killing spree "simple."

03:08.105 --> 03:10.187
But we're working on that. I mean,
you're able to control yourself

03:10.274 --> 03:11.684
really well in the lab right now.

03:11.776 --> 03:12.765
Uh huh.

03:12.860 --> 03:16.648
So, now it's time for a test
drive in the real world.

03:16.739 --> 03:19.651
Well, you certainly picked a good spot.

03:19.742 --> 03:25.203
The sexual energy in this room
is off the charts tonight.

03:25.289 --> 03:26.529
So, how do we do this?

03:26.624 --> 03:29.457
Tell me something first--when
you're in a crowd like this,

03:29.543 --> 03:31.579
how do you read libido?

03:33.214 --> 03:36.456
| see energy flow.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.666
Like an aura?

03:38.761 --> 03:40.422
Kind of.

03:42.223 --> 03:46.216
It's like the more aroused
someone is, the hotter they burn.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.813
Take them, for example.

03:49.897 --> 03:55.984
Okay. See, he is average.
She is way more into him.

03:56.070 --> 03:58.311
--You can tell all that?
--Yeah.

03:58.406 --> 04:02.991
Okay, so on a scale of one to ten?

04:03.077 --> 04:07.366
He's a four. She's a seven.

04:08.624 --> 04:12.708
Okay. What about me, right now?

04:14.755 --> 04:16.996
What about keeping this professional?

04:17.091 --> 04:19.377
Well, call it scientific curiosity.

04:19.468 --> 04:21.208
Okay.

04:23.764 --> 04:28.053
Well, you are definitely curious.

04:30.771 --> 04:34.559
I'm not so sure it's entirely scientific.

04:36.277 --> 04:37.517
We need another drink.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.863
Yeah, we do.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.938
Can we get two more?

04:47.204 --> 04:52.494
Oh, if I have one more lime, I'm not
going to be able to feel my lips.

04:53.794 --> 04:58.037
I like you like this.
I love after-hours Lauren.

04:58.132 --> 05:00.088
You need to work on not being
so in control all the time.

05:00.176 --> 05:04.670
No. We're here to work
on you gaining control.

05:06.182 --> 05:08.639
Come on.

05:08.726 --> 05:12.469
Okay. You ready for this?

05:12.563 --> 05:14.474
Hit me.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.615
You feel that?

05:33.167 --> 05:34.782
Yeah.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.293
But focus on what you're feeling.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.838
Hungry.

05:49.350 --> 05:51.932
This is crazy.

05:52.019 --> 05:55.102
I can't do this. Once I
start feeding, I can't stop.

05:55.189 --> 05:59.102
Yes, you can. You just
have to start believing it.

05:59.193 --> 06:01.184
You're ready, Bo.

06:04.782 --> 06:06.272
Some other time.

06:06.367 --> 06:08.824
Okay. We'll keep working on it.

06:08.911 --> 06:11.493
It might help if you stop
fighting your true nature.

06:11.580 --> 06:14.492
The Fae aren't monsters,
Bo, and neither are you.

06:14.583 --> 06:17.370
Sleep on it. We'll talk in the morning.

06:20.464 --> 06:22.295
How much longer is this going to take?

06:22.383 --> 06:23.623
Why, you got somewhere better to be?

06:23.717 --> 06:28.461
l'm starving. Plus this place gives
me the creeps. It's so "Lauren."

06:28.556 --> 06:30.797
Will you just give her a chance?

06:30.891 --> 06:32.882
She's a lot more interesting
than you think.

06:32.977 --> 06:36.060
Yeah. Only 'cause you
want to see her naked bits.

06:37.273 --> 06:37.762
Whoops.

06:37.815 --> 06:40.147
Hey! You break it, you bought it.

06:40.234 --> 06:43.351
I wouldn't be surprised. Doctors
are bigger con artists than I am.

06:43.445 --> 06:47.313
Will you just dial it down, Kenzi?
She's really helping me.

06:47.408 --> 06:50.150
Look, I'm really happy these
treatments are working for you,

06:52.413 --> 06:53.323
So?

06:53.414 --> 06:56.872
So, ever asked yourself what she's
getting out of this little arrangement?

06:56.959 --> 06:58.665
[LAUREN] Sorry, I'm late.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.913
--Busy morning?
--Yeah, and it just got busier.

07:01.005 --> 07:03.667
Can we reschedule? l have to
get to an outside appointment.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.214
--Anything wrong?
--|t's just official business.

07:06.302 --> 07:09.544
As in none of my business.

07:09.638 --> 07:12.505
And here I thought we
made progress last night.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.181
You could tag along.

07:14.268 --> 07:16.975
What is it, Take a Fae to Work Day?

07:19.106 --> 07:21.188
You want to know more
about my work with other Fae,

07:21.275 --> 07:23.516
you'd get to meet one from
one of the oldest Fae orders.

07:23.611 --> 07:25.818
Sure. We'd love to.

07:27.531 --> 07:29.897
We're off to visit a
sick patient at home.

07:29.992 --> 07:33.405
Whoa, whoa, whoa--sick?
Nobody mentioned sick.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.790
Where's Halima? The Ash sent me.

07:44.882 --> 07:45.871
Are you coming?

07:45.966 --> 07:50.585
Uh, I'll take a pass. Fae cooties.
I'm not big on sick peeps.

07:50.679 --> 07:54.388
Fine. Just wait here.
Just try not to break anything.

07:54.475 --> 07:56.716
"Just try not to break anything."

07:56.810 --> 08:00.018
Ow. Jeez.

08:06.987 --> 08:12.152
Oh, thank you for coming.
I so hate to cause a fuss.

08:12.242 --> 08:14.654
[LAUREN] Don't be silly.
You know we take care of our own.

08:14.745 --> 08:17.031
The Ash sends his best.

08:17.915 --> 08:20.497
Actually, you're my
first Aswang patient.

08:20.584 --> 08:24.247
I'm not surprised. We rarely
need to see a doctor.

08:24.338 --> 08:25.953
Sorry. Aswang?

08:26.048 --> 08:30.087
Oh, my assistant.
She's new to all this.

08:30.177 --> 08:33.260
Aswang are one of the older Fae
orders. They may not know it,

08:33.347 --> 08:36.305
but humans enjoy a very symbiotic
relationship with them.

08:36.392 --> 08:37.507
How so?

08:37.601 --> 08:41.469
Oh, we eat human corpses.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.770
Say again.

08:43.857 --> 08:47.270
She is new. Oh, we would
never take a human life.

08:47.361 --> 08:51.400
We just use their dead
bodies for our nourishment.

08:54.243 --> 08:56.484
Oh, score.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.082
Mmm-mmm.

09:06.588 --> 09:08.169
Yummy.

09:12.219 --> 09:15.507
Aswang help keep contagions
out of the human population

09:15.597 --> 09:21.308
by eating their diseased dead,
so both sides benefit.

09:21.395 --> 09:23.306
It's bad, isn't it?

09:23.397 --> 09:27.936
I'm not liking what I'm seeing.
Could it be due to someone you ate?

09:32.614 --> 09:35.856
I really don't see how this
could be food-related.

09:35.951 --> 09:40.661
I've eaten everything--
Cancer, Black Death, Ebola.

09:40.748 --> 09:42.033
With no past side effects?

09:42.124 --> 09:46.083
Just the occasional case of heartburn.

09:46.170 --> 09:50.163
But I know my body and
something is definitely wrong.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.758
I'm dying, aren't I?

09:51.842 --> 09:53.548
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

09:53.635 --> 09:56.172
I'm sure that Lauren can help you.

09:56.263 --> 10:01.007
Look, first, I need to isolate the cause.
And I'll have to check your food.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.968
What have you eaten
in the last 24 hours?

10:10.611 --> 10:12.977
What? What did I do?

10:17.993 --> 10:22.612
So, not only does this "Ass-wang"
have a very unfortunate name,

10:22.706 --> 10:27.871
but it also eats dead people? And
nobody thought to mention this to me?

10:27.961 --> 10:30.418
Like, "Hey, Kenzi, watch out
for random body parts."

10:30.506 --> 10:32.963
Or, you know, "By the way, foot soup!"

10:33.050 --> 10:34.881
Please just try to keep it down.

10:34.968 --> 10:38.426
I want to get a second opinion because
that is the worst possible advice ever!

10:38.514 --> 10:40.755
Kenzi, would you just relax?
It's going to be fine.

10:40.849 --> 10:42.055
Yeah.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.222
It is, right?

10:43.310 --> 10:44.891
We don't even know if the
soup made Halima sick.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.764
It could be completely unrelated.

10:46.855 --> 10:49.722
I mean, even if it was the soup, it
doesn't mean Kenzi will be affected.

10:49.817 --> 10:52.229
Human physiology is
completely different from Fae.

10:52.319 --> 10:53.900
Anybody have any mints?

10:53.987 --> 10:56.319
--So, what do we do?
--Well, I'll go check out the soup.

10:56.406 --> 10:58.397
I should know more in a few hours.

10:58.492 --> 11:01.655
Halima gets her food from
Pelway Funeral Homes.

11:01.745 --> 11:04.782
Just find out what you
can about the foot.

11:12.256 --> 11:15.464
Are you okay?

11:15.551 --> 11:17.587
l'm fantastic. Yeah.

11:17.678 --> 11:20.511
Worst case scenario,
I just ate toxic soup.

11:20.597 --> 11:24.590
Best case scenario, I am
a toe-sucking cannibal.

11:24.685 --> 11:27.802
Kenzi, we're going to figure this out,
okay? It's going to be fine.

11:29.189 --> 11:33.102
[KENZI] I'm always putting my foot in my
mouth, but at least it's always my foot.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.979
Drinks on you tonight.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.029
Now that's one fine ale.

11:40.117 --> 11:41.698
You should know.
You order it every time.

11:41.785 --> 11:46.950
What can I say? I take
comfort in routine.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.325
So, did you bring it?

11:48.417 --> 11:52.330
In all these years, have I
ever failed to deliver?

12:05.809 --> 12:09.393
I've been craving a
giant dish of Colcannon.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.060
This is the secret ingredient.

12:11.148 --> 12:14.185
How does the old song go?

12:14.276 --> 12:17.643
"Were those not the happy days
when troubles we had not."

12:17.738 --> 12:21.481
"Our mothers would make
Colcannon in a little skillet pot."

12:21.575 --> 12:24.533
Yes! I'll drink to that.

12:25.913 --> 12:27.904
So, what do you want for it?

12:31.251 --> 12:34.618
How about... that?

12:35.964 --> 12:38.341
The Gleipnir? Out of the question.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.416
You used to have a
better sense of humour.

12:40.510 --> 12:42.887
Come on, show it to me.

12:57.945 --> 13:01.187
Hard to believe it once
held the Fenris wolf.

13:01.281 --> 13:04.739
Forged by Dwarves.
Stronger than any other chain.

13:04.826 --> 13:07.784
The more Fenris struggled,
the stronger it became.

13:07.871 --> 13:12.035
It's a beauty. If ever
you want to trade it...

13:12.125 --> 13:13.376
Never going to happen.

13:13.460 --> 13:16.076
Never say never, old friend.

13:21.635 --> 13:26.379
Poor Halima. That's terrible. She's
been a customer of ours for years.

13:26.473 --> 13:27.974
How exactly does that work?

13:28.058 --> 13:31.892
Well, on the surface, we operate
as a typical funeral home

13:31.979 --> 13:34.971
and offer excellent service
for our human clients.

13:35.065 --> 13:39.058
And on the side you do hot business
by feeding grandma to the Fae?

13:39.152 --> 13:42.064
She's not feeling very well.
Please continue.

13:42.155 --> 13:45.943
We have very tight regulations for
our food appropriation stream.

13:46.034 --> 13:48.571
Only suitable candidates are selected.

13:48.662 --> 13:51.074
--Define "suitable."
--We|l, there's an extensive checklist.

13:51.164 --> 13:56.500
No immediate family. And factors
such as cause of death, age, ethnicity,

13:56.586 --> 13:59.578
all helps to assign the bodies
to the appropriate outlet.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.664
That's so recycle-y of you.

14:01.758 --> 14:05.125
I mean, why let something go to
waste if someone else needs it, right?

14:05.220 --> 14:06.255
Precisely.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.554
We need to know about your
last shipment to Halima.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.729
Let's see...

14:16.732 --> 14:22.477
Yes, right here--James Sibley, 43.
He was the victim of a hit-and-run.

14:22.571 --> 14:24.186
But I didn't like the look of him.

14:24.281 --> 14:26.442
Had him marked
"Aswang only," just in case.

14:26.533 --> 14:27.864
Why Aswang only?

14:27.951 --> 14:30.283
Well, we provide for many
carrion-feeding Fae,

14:30.370 --> 14:33.658
but very few have the
constitution of an Aswang.

14:33.749 --> 14:35.455
They can eat anything.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.999
So, we sent the entire
shipment to Halima.

14:38.086 --> 14:39.997
And Sibley's address?

14:40.088 --> 14:42.545
Right there.

14:42.632 --> 14:43.963
[BO] Are you sure you're okay?

14:44.051 --> 14:46.508
Because you look a little bit flushed.
Do you want me to carry that bag?

14:46.595 --> 14:49.962
Relax, Mom. I'm fine. Besides,
I'll need it in a second.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.012
What for?

14:51.099 --> 14:54.842
Decent neighbourhood.
Decent building. You do the math.

14:54.936 --> 14:56.847
I thought we agreed
no stealing on jobs.

14:56.938 --> 14:58.678
Technically can't
steal from a dead guy.

14:58.774 --> 15:01.937
Seriously, it's a thing. Ask museums.

15:16.416 --> 15:21.877
[KENZI] Somebody was definitely
looking for something. What a mess.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.043
I take it you're not the maid.

15:26.134 --> 15:27.419
Shut up, whore.

15:27.511 --> 15:30.218
Ohh, mouth! There are ladies present.

15:30.305 --> 15:31.841
Hey, hey!

15:31.932 --> 15:33.888
What, are you kiddin', little girl?

15:39.606 --> 15:41.107
[KENZI] Ah!

15:41.191 --> 15:44.058
Kenzi! Kenzi! Were you hit?

15:44.152 --> 15:49.988
No. But suddenly, I don't feel so good.

15:53.495 --> 15:55.235
Oh, shit.

15:59.876 --> 16:02.083
You are nasty, aren't you?

16:03.964 --> 16:05.875
--What happened?
--She collapsed.

16:05.966 --> 16:07.376
Dammit. Over here.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.379
Everybody just calm down.
It's just a little eye blood, okay.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.301
Who hasn't had a little
eye blood before, huh?

16:12.389 --> 16:15.222
--Can you help her?
--I think | just sneezed too hard.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.218
| just need to go home.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.970
--Can we just go, please?
--No. No.

16:18.061 --> 16:19.767
I did develop a rudimentary treatment.

16:19.855 --> 16:21.220
See, I told you I'd be fine.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.100
So give it to her.

16:24.860 --> 16:26.316
Come here.

16:27.821 --> 16:31.439
A treatment isn't a cure. If she is
bleeding internally like Halima,

16:31.533 --> 16:35.071
I can give her a platelet transfusion.
Try to slow it down.

16:35.162 --> 16:37.118
But it won't last long.

16:42.711 --> 16:43.951
Exactly what are we dealing with here?

16:44.045 --> 16:46.582
It's a hemorrhagic fever from
some sort of thread virus

16:46.673 --> 16:47.753
I've never even seen before.

16:47.841 --> 16:50.253
--We|l, where the hell did it come from?
--Definitely the foot.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.927
I found a chemical substance
in the tissue I can't identify.

16:54.014 --> 16:56.676
The funeral director said that foot
guy died from a simple hit-and-run,

16:56.766 --> 16:57.972
not some damn plague.

16:58.059 --> 16:59.515
That may have been the official C.O.D.,

16:59.603 --> 17:02.140
but he was definitely a
very sick man before that.

17:02.230 --> 17:06.473
You should know that Halima's getting
worse. Her family's bringing her in.

17:06.568 --> 17:07.523
How do we fix this?

17:07.611 --> 17:10.478
If we can find the original
source of infection,

17:10.572 --> 17:14.110
theoretically, I can use a
sample to create an antitoxin.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.988
l'll dig into Sibley's life
and see what I can find out.

17:18.038 --> 17:18.948
--Hey.
--Hey.

17:19.039 --> 17:22.372
I'll be back soon, okay?
You are in good hands.

17:22.459 --> 17:24.199
You take care of her.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.624
Anything yet?

17:28.715 --> 17:31.206
Well, it looks like this guy
couldn't hold down a job.

17:31.301 --> 17:34.509
And then, eight months
ago, right here,

17:34.596 --> 17:37.008
a steady stream of money started
flowing into his account

17:37.098 --> 17:39.305
from Taberman & Associates.

17:39.392 --> 17:42.179
Well, maybe they know something.
Can you get an address?

17:42.270 --> 17:44.386
No. It doesn't exist. It's a front.

17:44.481 --> 17:46.642
Dammit.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.473
Well, what about the guy
tossing Sibley's apartment?

17:48.568 --> 17:49.978
Remember anything about him?

17:50.070 --> 17:54.484
I don't know. He was a white guy,
maybe 5'10. He seemed like a pro.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.815
Oh, he had a tattoo on his arm.

17:56.910 --> 17:58.901
Well, what did it look like?
I'll run it through the database.

17:58.995 --> 18:00.860
There was a skull and
these big-ass horns

18:00.956 --> 18:04.540
and, like, a wheel or some kind of tire.

18:04.626 --> 18:06.036
--A motorcycle wheel?
--Yeah.

18:06.127 --> 18:07.742
I don't even need to look that one up.

18:07.837 --> 18:09.919
It's the Iron Chains.
It's a local biker gang.

18:10.006 --> 18:11.871
Come on, I know where they hang out.

18:17.138 --> 18:18.639
Hello, boys.

18:21.017 --> 18:22.553
There he is.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.812
Back off. I got nothin' to say to you.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.113
Friendly place.

18:40.954 --> 18:44.788
Anyone else want to be stupid?
We're just here for some information.

18:44.874 --> 18:45.784
Feel like talking now, huh?

18:45.875 --> 18:47.786
All right. It ain't worth this trouble.

18:47.877 --> 18:48.866
[BO] What were you
doing in that apartment?

18:48.962 --> 18:50.543
A guy paid me 500 bucks to clean it out.

18:50.630 --> 18:51.540
What guy?

18:51.631 --> 18:53.417
I didn't get a name.

18:53.508 --> 18:54.623
But I followed him downtown.

18:54.718 --> 18:57.255
I wanted to know where he was
in case he tried to stiff me.

18:57.345 --> 18:58.926
--And?
--He went into this ugly building

18:59.014 --> 19:01.050
on the corner of
Dunkirk and University.

19:01.141 --> 19:04.133
A place called Baron Chemical.

19:04.227 --> 19:05.763
[BO] We got a break in the case.

19:05.854 --> 19:07.219
What can I do?

19:07.314 --> 19:11.023
You can rest. I can
handle this one solo.

19:11.985 --> 19:15.569
Just hang in there 'til I get back. Deal?

19:15.655 --> 19:17.270
Deal.

19:23.413 --> 19:25.654
You'll stay with me though, right?

19:25.749 --> 19:27.330
You bet.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.580
I'm not going anywhere.

19:31.671 --> 19:34.253
Promise?

19:34.341 --> 19:35.581
Promise.

19:35.675 --> 19:41.921
Good. I'm not scared or anything.
I'm just bored and you amuse me.

19:42.015 --> 19:43.926
You think Baron Chemical's involved?

19:44.017 --> 19:45.507
Well, that's what everything
is pointing to.

19:45.602 --> 19:48.264
I mean, maybe Sibley
was some kind of lab rat.

19:48.355 --> 19:51.142
Well, that would explain the
residual chemicals in his system.

19:51.232 --> 19:52.938
But if so, it's not an approved trial.

19:53.026 --> 19:55.108
--How do you know?
--We track all clinically approved

19:55.195 --> 19:58.608
trials globally, make sure none
are problematic for the Fae.

19:58.698 --> 20:02.111
None of the Phase III drugs that
they're testing would cause this.

20:02.202 --> 20:05.319
Whatever is killing Kenzi
is somewhere in that place.

20:05.413 --> 20:07.369
l'm breaking in and I need your help.

20:07.457 --> 20:10.164
Me? What can I do?

20:10.251 --> 20:12.116
You can come with me.

20:12.212 --> 20:14.954
I need your expertise. I don't
even know what I am looking for.

20:15.048 --> 20:17.289
It's crazy. It's too dangerous.

20:17.384 --> 20:20.171
So what? I should just let Kenzi die?

20:20.261 --> 20:23.344
Of course not. Besides,
I work for the Ash.

20:23.431 --> 20:25.513
| just can't go and pursue
things unapproved.

20:25.600 --> 20:26.715
This thing kills Fae.

20:26.810 --> 20:31.179
I mean, how is helping me find it
not in the Ash's best interest?

20:35.318 --> 20:39.231
We're in luck. Baron Chemical's been
cited for processing errors in its labs

20:39.322 --> 20:41.734
and it's struggling to
calm stockholder jitters.

20:41.825 --> 20:43.156
--We|l, how is that lucky?
--Because,

20:43.243 --> 20:45.655
they're bringing in outside
Quality Control Inspectors.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.986
I could pose as this one.

20:48.081 --> 20:51.994
She's flying into town tonight.
You think you can detain her?

20:52.085 --> 20:55.577
We've got someone placed at
Customs. He owes me a favour.

20:55.672 --> 20:59.756
He could possibly hold her for
24 hours or so. Let me check.

20:59.843 --> 21:02.209
Call me when Kenzi wakes up.

21:04.139 --> 21:06.221
What do I do?

21:06.307 --> 21:12.052
Well, Baron's Chief of Operations
is a legendary letch, so...

21:14.274 --> 21:17.357
He's had a revolving door of
assistants over the past year.

21:17.444 --> 21:22.404
I'm sure you can convince him
to take you on, so to speak.

21:28.455 --> 21:33.245
I am here to see the
Director of Operations.

21:33.334 --> 21:35.290
That's me.

21:35.378 --> 21:37.084
Hi.

21:37.172 --> 21:38.457
What can I do you for?

21:38.548 --> 21:43.884
l'm Cindy. I heard that you
could use a new assistant.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.710
--Walk with me.
--O kay.

21:45.805 --> 21:49.798
I'm telling you, I am a doctor.
lam not a drug mule.

21:49.893 --> 21:50.882
So you keep saying.

21:50.977 --> 21:54.219
Okay, look, can we just
please talk about this?

21:54.314 --> 21:56.555
I'm sure that there's
some logical explanation.

21:56.649 --> 21:59.265
And I'm sure the judge is interested.
Can you get me a 1059, please?

21:59.360 --> 22:02.727
Okay, this is ludicrous!
Call Baron Chemical.

22:02.822 --> 22:05.234
They flew me in to start a new contract.

22:05.325 --> 22:07.611
With a drug company.
How convenient is that?

22:07.702 --> 22:09.658
l have no idea how that
stuff got in my bag.

22:09.746 --> 22:12.453
What stuff? The drugs
or the pipe bomb?

22:12.540 --> 22:16.453
Bomb? I need to sit down.

22:16.544 --> 22:18.921
Be my guest.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.667
You're going to be here awhile,
so please, get comfortable.

22:24.886 --> 22:29.505
Hey, can you watch her while
I take this down to Evidence?

22:37.190 --> 22:40.102
Hey.

22:40.193 --> 22:41.683
Here's the Baron lD.

22:41.778 --> 22:43.359
So, what happens to the real Karina?

22:43.446 --> 22:45.482
Well, legally, I can
hold her for 24 hours.

22:45.573 --> 22:47.609
And then she'll be
released, no charges.

22:47.700 --> 22:48.530
Thank you for this.

22:48.618 --> 22:50.609
To be honest, I'm surprised
the Ash is condoning it.

22:50.703 --> 22:53.945
Well, he wasn't going to.
I talked him into it.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.998
Well, for Kenzi's sake, I hope
you know what you're doing.

23:07.428 --> 23:08.964
Dyson?

23:09.055 --> 23:10.886
Anyone?

23:20.942 --> 23:23.228
[DOCTOR] She is unresponsive.

23:23.319 --> 23:26.311
Get to [inaudible]. He's got it.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.692
BP's dropping. We're losing her!

23:30.952 --> 23:33.364
No. No. Please, somebody help her.

23:33.454 --> 23:34.534
Get the human out of here.

23:34.622 --> 23:38.661
Please help her. No.
Let me go! Let me go!

23:38.751 --> 23:42.539
No. No, no! Bo!

23:42.630 --> 23:45.872
[screaming]

23:54.601 --> 23:57.183
What took you so long?
I have been waiting in Rat City

23:57.270 --> 24:00.262
for, like, the last half hour!
I think they're starting to judge me.

24:00.356 --> 24:03.519
I'm sorry. I couldn't get away.
They were giving me the grand tour.

24:03.610 --> 24:05.521
What about on your end?
Any problems with Kouyoumijian?

24:05.612 --> 24:07.193
No, none. I'm in.
What did you find out?

24:07.280 --> 24:09.521
What we're looking for
is probably in Sector 6,

24:09.616 --> 24:11.106
but I'm not cleared for access to it.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.360
Well, what about the security?

24:12.452 --> 24:14.363
There's three on every floor, two posts.

24:14.454 --> 24:15.864
Okay, I can handle that. Let's go.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.741
Bo, listen to yourself,
you're not thinking clearly.

24:17.832 --> 24:20.198
No, I don't want to think,
Lauren, I want to do something.

24:20.293 --> 24:24.036
Our chances of actually saving Kenzi go
up if we're not actually caught first.

24:24.130 --> 24:27.748
Look, I know that you're impulsive,
but we need a plan. That's how I work.

24:27.842 --> 24:30.879
Fine. Fine, we'll play it your way.
What is your brilliant plan?

24:30.970 --> 24:33.052
Okay, well, Sector 6
is a restricted zone.

24:33.139 --> 24:35.551
So, we need a key pass
and a voice cue.

24:35.642 --> 24:37.223
You need to get both from your boss.

24:37.310 --> 24:39.141
Okay, no problem.
I'll just succubus him.

24:39.228 --> 24:40.604
Again, use your head.

24:40.688 --> 24:42.895
If you lose control and start
leaving bodies all over the place,

24:42.982 --> 24:44.313
it's just going to bring more attention.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.891
If I can't succubus him,
how am I supposed to pull this off?

24:46.986 --> 24:49.773
You have more than enough
charms all on your own.

24:50.823 --> 24:53.940
Now listen, our odds go up if we try
this after-hours. So, at seven o'clock,

24:54.035 --> 24:55.741
I'm going to create a
diversion in the lab,

24:55.828 --> 24:58.740
it'll temporarily disable the
guards. That's your cue.

24:58.831 --> 25:01.618
If we screw this up, how
long does Kenzi have?

25:01.709 --> 25:04.371
Let's just make sure
that doesn't happen.

25:20.103 --> 25:23.061
Didn't you already take my blood?

25:24.732 --> 25:29.977
If this is some weird blood donor
thing, cookies are usually provided.

25:37.537 --> 25:40.995
What do you have to be so
high and mighty about, huh?

25:42.291 --> 25:45.419
It's not like you saved that Aswang.

25:49.549 --> 25:54.339
That's right. You couldn't save her.

25:54.429 --> 25:58.718
So, how hard are you going to try
to save a dirty human, huh?

26:03.229 --> 26:06.312
Unless you want to get stuck
with a contaminated needle,

26:06.399 --> 26:09.232
I need you to help me
get out of this hellhole.

26:09.318 --> 26:11.149
What do you want?

26:11.237 --> 26:12.738
Strip.

27:04.457 --> 27:06.743
You let her leave? Where did she go?

27:06.834 --> 27:11.043
No idea. Can't be far though.
She's deteriorating too fast.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.290
How long does she have?

27:12.381 --> 27:13.882
She's human, so it's
hard to know for sure,

27:13.966 --> 27:16.753
but I'd say less than 12 hours.

27:16.844 --> 27:17.708
Is she contagious?

27:17.804 --> 27:21.843
Not unless you plan on eating her,
which would serve her right.

27:24.977 --> 27:26.763
We have to keep this quiet.
No one can know.

27:26.854 --> 27:30.767
Not Lauren, not Bo, no one. Got it?

27:49.502 --> 27:54.587
I called your references.
You come highly recommended.

27:54.674 --> 28:00.169
Well, that's me.
Satisfaction guaranteed.

28:03.015 --> 28:06.758
You know, I don't want you to get
the wrong idea about me, though.

28:06.853 --> 28:11.597
See, I'm a good girl.
I'm very, very good.

28:11.691 --> 28:14.603
--I can see that.
--Yeah.

28:14.694 --> 28:17.686
But I do have one small
confession to make

28:17.780 --> 28:19.441
and it's kind of embarrassing.

28:19.532 --> 28:21.773
Oh, your secrets are safe with me.

28:21.868 --> 28:23.859
I don't know how to
pronounce your name.

28:23.953 --> 28:28.788
Is that all? Oh, don't be
embarrassed, it happens a lot.

28:28.875 --> 28:31.287
lt's Mkhitar Kouyoumijian.

28:31.377 --> 28:33.117
Kouyou...

28:33.212 --> 28:35.373
--Not bad.
--So strange.

28:35.464 --> 28:38.547
I don't usually have trouble
wrapping my mouth around things.

28:38.634 --> 28:43.219
Mkhitar Kouyoumijian...

28:43.306 --> 28:45.968
Wow, wow.

28:46.058 --> 28:51.473
Such a sexy, sexy name.

28:51.564 --> 28:53.725
lt's five o'clock. I'll see you tomorrow.

28:53.816 --> 28:55.647
What?

28:55.735 --> 29:00.525
Oh, you little tease.

29:17.757 --> 29:20.089
Big ups for finding me.

29:22.929 --> 29:27.093
It's a rather morbid
choice of a resting place.

29:27.183 --> 29:30.346
I came here a lot when l was a kid.

29:30.436 --> 29:34.145
Sometimes, you just need
a place to think, you know?

29:37.777 --> 29:41.110
You promised you wouldn't leave.

29:41.197 --> 29:43.062
I'm sorry about that.

29:43.157 --> 29:46.194
Bo needed help.
Came back as soon as I could.

29:46.285 --> 29:49.948
I'm not going back
to that place, period.

29:50.039 --> 29:55.955
lt's way too Cuckoo's Nest.
I'd rather die in a ditch.

29:56.045 --> 30:00.209
Kenzi, you're not going to die.

30:00.299 --> 30:03.757
But I'll take you somewhere else,
somewhere safe.

30:07.390 --> 30:08.926
Okay.

30:10.184 --> 30:14.223
But can we stay here a
bit longer? It's nice.

30:14.313 --> 30:17.931
Unless you have somewhere to be.

30:19.318 --> 30:21.274
No, I'm good.

30:42.675 --> 30:47.260
Hey. Those Quality Control geeks
allowed to be here unsupervised?

30:47.346 --> 30:50.133
Hey Clint, be advised--clearing
out a bogey on floor five.

30:50.224 --> 30:54.513
Doctor Hansen? Doctor Hansen!

31:12.872 --> 31:16.364
Sorry. You'll sleep it off.

31:16.459 --> 31:19.166
Bo? You're good to go.

31:20.212 --> 31:21.201
Thanks for closing early.

31:21.297 --> 31:23.583
Yeah. The fewer who know
about this, the better.

31:25.384 --> 31:30.219
You know, they're going to be
expecting her back at the lab.

31:31.766 --> 31:33.722
The Ash could come after
you for insubordination.

31:33.809 --> 31:36.300
Hey, I don't always take
my orders from the Ash.

31:36.395 --> 31:40.388
True, but he's not
supposed to know that.

31:40.483 --> 31:42.519
[DYSON] Can you do anything for her?

31:42.610 --> 31:44.692
I can buy her some time.

31:46.655 --> 31:50.398
But the rest is up to Bo and Lauren.

31:50.493 --> 31:53.576
Did ljust wake up in Narnia,

31:53.662 --> 31:55.573
or is that the fever talking?

31:55.664 --> 31:58.201
Shh. Rest.

32:10.638 --> 32:16.383
You know what? You really fill that out.

32:16.477 --> 32:18.013
You aren't clear to be here, ma'am.

32:18.104 --> 32:22.518
Oh, I know but I just
love a man in uniform.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.769
Honey, that makes two of us.

32:24.860 --> 32:28.444
Oh, shit. A succubus it is.

32:40.543 --> 32:42.704
I really shouldn't be enjoying this.

32:42.795 --> 32:44.581
Focus.

32:58.686 --> 33:03.100
Oh no, no. NO, no, no, no, no, no, no.

33:03.190 --> 33:06.432
Shit. Come on.

33:06.527 --> 33:10.236
Ssss.. that was great.

33:10.322 --> 33:14.986
I did it! I did it! Check me out!

33:15.077 --> 33:16.487
Okay.

33:19.165 --> 33:21.326
Not so fast!

33:25.379 --> 33:26.960
What the hell did you do to me?

33:27.047 --> 33:29.299
Apparently, not enough.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.509
So, this is what I get
for playing nice, huh?

33:34.597 --> 33:37.179
I don't know what
you're playing, but it--

33:41.687 --> 33:44.303
Look at you, saving my ass, huh?

33:44.398 --> 33:47.515
I know. It was incredible.

33:47.610 --> 33:50.693
He'll be okay once it wears off.

33:50.779 --> 33:54.818
But I am officially out of my element.

33:54.909 --> 33:58.242
--|t's time to play it your way.
--Good. Let's do this.

33:59.788 --> 34:03.622
Wait, wait, wait. Did you,
you know, with him?

34:03.709 --> 34:05.165
Yeah.

34:05.252 --> 34:09.165
--But he's alive.
--Yeah, I stopped myself.

34:11.425 --> 34:13.040
Now, c'mon.

34:17.723 --> 34:19.805
You're late, Arval. l was beginning
to think you weren't going to show.

34:19.892 --> 34:22.725
Patience. You requested
a very rare commodity.

34:22.811 --> 34:24.642
--And did you get it?
--With difficulty.

34:24.730 --> 34:27.813
I had to trade some of
my prize possessions--

34:27.900 --> 34:31.893
my last phoenix skin,
a rare tusk, a first edition of--

34:31.987 --> 34:34.103
Yeah, let me see it.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.327
--|t's perfect.
--|t's expensive.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.283
You think you can afford it?

34:52.424 --> 34:54.415
The Gleipnir. Are you sure?

34:54.510 --> 34:56.216
I'm sure.

34:56.303 --> 34:58.715
And a further future trade.

35:01.433 --> 35:03.219
We have a deal, my friend.

35:03.310 --> 35:06.598
Excellent. Take care.

35:42.808 --> 35:45.220
[TRICK] Don't.

35:45.311 --> 35:46.972
[KENZI] Sorry.

35:49.815 --> 35:51.646
What is it?

35:54.528 --> 35:57.065
Something | no longer use.

35:57.156 --> 36:00.740
Come, have some tea.

36:00.826 --> 36:05.240
This should improve your strength.
Slow the bleeding for a little while.

36:05.331 --> 36:07.993
I had to guess at the human dosage.

36:10.252 --> 36:13.995
For a cranky old bartender, you do
pretty good with the nurturing, huh?

36:14.089 --> 36:16.375
I've had experience.

36:17.885 --> 36:19.716
Here you go.

36:21.347 --> 36:24.805
What is it? Eye of newt?

36:24.892 --> 36:26.848
Something like that.

36:26.935 --> 36:30.598
It's a Abath horn.

36:30.689 --> 36:33.180
Thanks.

36:33.275 --> 36:37.188
And thanks for letting me crash here.
I'm feeling better already.

36:37.279 --> 36:42.023
I think this is just one of those,
like, 24-hour plagues, no?

36:55.130 --> 36:58.122
So our work is paying off.
I mean, you can control it.

36:58.217 --> 36:59.457
You know what this means?

36:59.551 --> 37:04.170
It means I have a lot to thank you for.
But first, we got to save Kenzi.

37:06.767 --> 37:09.383
[recorded voice] Mkhitar Kouyoumijian.

37:10.229 --> 37:13.767
Hey, eyes open. We need to find
core samples, genetic materials...

37:18.654 --> 37:21.612
You think it's whatever's
in the giant frickin' tank?

37:33.419 --> 37:35.375
Here, fishy-fishy.

37:36.755 --> 37:39.588
Oh, wow. That is not a fish.
That is a snake.

37:39.675 --> 37:43.213
That's no snake. That's a Basilisk.

37:43.303 --> 37:44.759
Is that bad?

37:44.847 --> 37:49.591
It's just bizarre. It's an extremely rare
Underfae with incredibly toxic skin.

37:49.685 --> 37:51.641
I'm amazed they even got it in here.

37:55.983 --> 37:58.770
Poor thing. They have
it on life support.

38:00.612 --> 38:03.024
Ah, l'm frickin' freezing, dude.

38:03.115 --> 38:05.948
Can you, like, wolf out
and lie on my feet?

38:06.034 --> 38:07.615
Maybe later.

38:10.998 --> 38:15.207
Hey, Bo's going to come
through. She always does.

38:15.294 --> 38:18.786
Then why do you all look
so freaked out, huh?

38:18.881 --> 38:24.421
It's not polite to lie to the dying
girl, you know. It's bad juju.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.972
Just lay back.

38:33.479 --> 38:39.395
Look, I need you to full-up
deathbed promise me something.

38:39.485 --> 38:41.066
Kenzi.

38:41.153 --> 38:43.644
| see more than anyone thinks.

38:43.739 --> 38:45.946
And that's because no
one's watching me.

38:46.033 --> 38:49.275
Everyone's always watching Bo.

38:49.369 --> 38:54.614
And what I see is you helping
her, even though it hurts you.

38:57.252 --> 38:59.459
--So?
--So how can you protect her

38:59.546 --> 39:02.458
if being with her makes you weak?

39:06.345 --> 39:10.805
--|'m working on that.
--Look,

39:10.891 --> 39:16.636
what I'm asking is if
I'm not here someday,

39:16.730 --> 39:22.896
can I count on you to have her back,
even if it means cutting her loose?

39:26.740 --> 39:29.482
Just please drink your tea.

39:41.380 --> 39:42.460
What are you doing?

39:42.548 --> 39:45.039
I need a tissue sample.

39:49.555 --> 39:52.547
I'll do it. Go get its attention.

39:58.146 --> 39:59.306
Okay, where?

39:59.398 --> 40:02.231
Okay, to your right.

40:03.610 --> 40:04.645
Okay, where?

40:04.736 --> 40:07.068
Right here. To your left a little bit.

40:08.907 --> 40:10.647
--A|most.
--Where? Where? Where?

40:10.742 --> 40:12.778
One more time. Right there, right there.

40:14.788 --> 40:16.153
[shrieking]

40:16.248 --> 40:17.704
Now!

40:24.464 --> 40:25.715
--What else do we need?
--Just this.

40:25.799 --> 40:27.005
I'll use it to make an antitoxin.

40:27.092 --> 40:28.593
Good. Let's go.

40:29.803 --> 40:30.838
What's wrong?

40:30.929 --> 40:32.669
Well, we can't leave it here.
It's too dangerous.

40:32.764 --> 40:34.595
Well, we're not going
to take it with us.

40:34.683 --> 40:38.722
Look, it's no good to them
if it's dead. Help me.

40:40.856 --> 40:42.767
Okay, on my go, pull that plug.

40:42.858 --> 40:44.314
Okay.

40:47.821 --> 40:49.277
Go.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.202
--They're onto us.
--We don't have much time.

40:57.289 --> 40:58.779
The lab's going to be on
automatic lockdown.

40:58.874 --> 41:00.410
Okay, let's go.

41:08.050 --> 41:11.042
She's still burning up. How
long is this supposed to take?

41:11.136 --> 41:13.001
It should be working by now.

41:23.815 --> 41:24.804
Bo?

41:24.900 --> 41:28.734
Hey. Hey. I'm right here. I'm right here.

41:28.820 --> 41:30.321
Hey.

41:35.327 --> 41:38.285
I'm hungry.

41:38.372 --> 41:39.737
Any special requests?

41:39.831 --> 41:43.164
Yeah, no more feet.

41:43.251 --> 41:46.584
Healing will be slow, so she's going
to need to take it easy for awhile.

41:46.672 --> 41:49.539
Yeah, good luck convincing her of that.

41:52.761 --> 41:54.467
Hey, Lauren.

41:57.099 --> 41:59.135
Thank you...

41:59.226 --> 42:01.683
for everything.

42:01.770 --> 42:04.603
I should be thanking you. It was...

42:04.690 --> 42:08.148
it was really nice to get out
of my shell for a little while.

42:11.279 --> 42:14.817
--Lauren, listen--
--|t's okay.

42:14.908 --> 42:17.695
I know we're not undercover anymore.

42:17.786 --> 42:20.448
This is the real world.

42:20.539 --> 42:24.703
I'm happy Kenzi's going
to be okay. I should go.

42:30.382 --> 42:33.966
Mmm. Meaty goodness.

42:34.052 --> 42:35.838
Come to mama.

42:39.057 --> 42:40.718
Everything all good?

42:40.809 --> 42:45.223
It's great, actually.
Kenzi's on the mend.

42:45.313 --> 42:48.396
I scored major points with
the Ash for helping solve this.

42:48.483 --> 42:51.566
And my sex life is no
longer on the critical list.

42:51.653 --> 42:53.234
Oh yeah? How so?

42:53.321 --> 42:55.482
My training is working.

42:55.574 --> 42:59.408
I can probably have sex with
humans now, no casualties.

42:59.494 --> 43:01.155
Well, that's a good thing.

43:01.246 --> 43:03.862
I guess we have the good
doctor to thank for that?

43:03.957 --> 43:06.039
Is she going to be
your first test subject?

43:06.126 --> 43:08.742
Would that be a problem?

43:08.837 --> 43:12.876
What you do with other
people is your business.

43:12.966 --> 43:15.173
So, you wouldn't mind

43:15.260 --> 43:19.173
if I started seeing other
people then, hypothetically?

43:19.264 --> 43:20.879
Not at all.

43:27.606 --> 43:29.142
Good to know.
