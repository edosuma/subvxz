00:10.791 --> 00:13.500
Well, then… Cheers.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.125
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

00:18.291 --> 00:19.125
Yes.

00:19.208 --> 00:22.666
Mr. Nakagawa, congratulations
on getting the Olympics.

00:22.750 --> 00:24.666
I'm looking forward to 2020.

00:24.750 --> 00:27.291
-Thank you.
-Yes.

00:27.791 --> 00:28.750
Things really changed

00:29.250 --> 00:33.625
after we had the prime minister say
everything was under control at Fukushima.

00:34.750 --> 00:37.625
When you stepped in as an advisor,
Mr. Toyoda, we got immediate results.

00:37.708 --> 00:41.208
It was nothing. It's thanks to
the prime minister's excellent delivery.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.083
Besides, it was Murakami
who put together the data.

00:45.583 --> 00:47.000
He has a promising future.

00:47.083 --> 00:48.458
You must be proud.

00:49.083 --> 00:51.791
The future of politics
is in giving a good performance.

00:52.375 --> 00:53.583
Here's to our future.

00:54.083 --> 00:54.916
Thank you.

00:59.791 --> 01:02.458
Matsuda, is something wrong?

01:03.666 --> 01:04.500
No.

01:06.666 --> 01:08.416
Please speak frankly.

01:10.083 --> 01:10.958
Yes, sir.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.250
It seemed to me like some points
in the speech were not exactly factual.

01:23.291 --> 01:26.375
No. I'll take that back. I'm sorry.

01:29.791 --> 01:33.541
Slight nuances are soon forgotten.
Don't you worry about it.

01:36.125 --> 01:37.291
Good night.

01:45.833 --> 01:48.000
You don't understand a damn thing, do you?

01:49.041 --> 01:51.625
What are you trying to prove,
righteously spouting your opinions?

01:52.583 --> 01:56.333
You saw how hard
I've worked to bring us this far.

02:02.541 --> 02:03.541
What's with that look?

02:04.208 --> 02:07.000
This isn't a problem that can be
dealt with through performance.

02:09.708 --> 02:11.708
First, we just need
to get people to believe.

02:12.625 --> 02:15.916
It's your job to figure out
how to deal with things after that.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.833
You've got a lot to learn
about how the system works.

02:22.500 --> 02:23.375
Yes, sir.

02:26.250 --> 02:27.875
Apologize.

02:35.458 --> 02:37.083
I'm sorry.

02:42.416 --> 02:46.333
Okay. That's enough about this. Right?

02:47.375 --> 02:51.125
Today's a day for celebration.
Let's get good and drunk.

02:54.250 --> 02:55.958
You'll join us too, right, Murakami?

02:56.916 --> 02:57.875
Sure.

03:00.916 --> 03:04.125
Okay. I couldn't get drunk just now, so…

03:05.875 --> 03:06.833
Let's drink.

03:08.208 --> 03:09.250
Okay.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.083
<i>Kohei.</i>

03:15.291 --> 03:17.041
<i>Help me out here, Matsuda.</i>

03:17.958 --> 03:20.375
<i>What happened to you, Kohei?</i>

04:21.166 --> 04:25.000
I heard that you've been
snooping around my affairs.

04:27.916 --> 04:29.833
Why don't you tell us about it?

04:32.916 --> 04:33.958
Yes, well,

04:35.583 --> 04:38.208
when I was looking into
the Touto News reporter, Matsuda…

04:40.375 --> 04:42.458
I learned about Kohei Matsuda.

04:43.541 --> 04:44.541
So?

04:44.625 --> 04:46.958
Why did you have to look into my affairs?

04:47.041 --> 04:48.000
Well, you see…

04:50.666 --> 04:52.791
when I learned that
Kohei Matsuda was hospitalized--

04:52.875 --> 04:55.708
Hold on! That's irrelevant.

04:57.250 --> 04:59.000
What are you trying to connect that to?

05:03.125 --> 05:06.833
The subsidies for AI
from the Ministry of Economy.

05:06.916 --> 05:09.625
Don't do any research
that has nothing to do with your work.

05:10.750 --> 05:13.250
I'm terribly sorry. I will keep
a closer eye on him from now on.

05:14.666 --> 05:15.541
I'm sorry.

05:20.083 --> 05:23.666
Well, this is CIRO, after all.

05:24.541 --> 05:26.916
I know it's your job to delve into things,

05:27.583 --> 05:29.583
but don't go investigating your friends.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.416
I'll admit, a lot of suspicions
were cast on me about the subsidies.

05:36.041 --> 05:37.375
But none of it is true.

05:38.125 --> 05:39.541
The police stopped pursuing it.

05:40.875 --> 05:43.000
Give it up, would you?

05:44.541 --> 05:47.625
I'm also saddened
by what happened to Matsuda.

05:48.833 --> 05:50.333
He was very talented.

05:52.583 --> 05:53.500
That's enough of this.

05:56.250 --> 05:58.000
The Olympics are in one year.

06:00.250 --> 06:01.750
We need you to fall in line.

06:02.333 --> 06:03.666
Certainly, sir.

06:03.750 --> 06:07.791
Well, we are colleagues
who worked together before, after all.

06:09.875 --> 06:11.375
Let's get along.

06:12.333 --> 06:13.166
Okay?

06:17.125 --> 06:21.958
MR. KITANO ALSO CONFIRMED THE DOCUMENT

06:25.375 --> 06:26.583
Mr. Kurosaki,

06:27.666 --> 06:31.416
I heard that you were the superior
that Kazuya Suzuki trusted most.

06:37.666 --> 06:39.500
We worked together previously.

06:42.208 --> 06:45.625
Were you the one who asked him to come
to the Chubu Local Finance Bureau?

06:49.375 --> 06:53.833
According to the hospital visitor records,
you met Mr. Suzuki before he died.

07:03.041 --> 07:03.916
I need to go.

07:04.750 --> 07:07.208
Mr. Kurosaki. Please.

07:08.666 --> 07:10.875
I need your cooperation

07:12.041 --> 07:14.041
to better understand what happened.

07:16.875 --> 07:18.958
Don't act like you know how things are!

07:20.750 --> 07:23.833
You can't possibly understand how we feel!

07:24.833 --> 07:27.916
I think I do understand
how difficult it is to survive

07:29.083 --> 07:30.291
within the system.

07:32.458 --> 07:34.000
It's not just the system!

07:35.250 --> 07:36.833
I have a family.

07:38.041 --> 07:40.250
I have my own life!

07:42.333 --> 07:43.583
Mr. Suzuki…

07:46.625 --> 07:48.208
also had a family.

08:03.708 --> 08:05.291
<i>Why did you do that?</i>

08:05.875 --> 08:08.625
Mr. Toyoda clearly committed fraud.

08:08.708 --> 08:12.500
But the investigation was called off,
and it all ended inexplicably.

08:13.166 --> 08:15.666
We're not the ones
who determine fact from fiction.

08:16.416 --> 08:18.541
But he defrauded
the government of ten billion yen.

08:19.250 --> 08:21.750
It was all paid with taxpayers' money.

08:24.125 --> 08:25.166
Don't make me say it again.

08:25.875 --> 08:29.500
Do as you are told and simply
write reports that are based on the facts.

08:30.833 --> 08:31.833
Also,

08:33.583 --> 08:36.083
we know everything you do
and everywhere you go.

08:37.583 --> 08:39.916
Even after you leave this place.

08:41.416 --> 08:42.875
Make sure you remember that.

09:01.166 --> 09:02.208
I see.

09:03.916 --> 09:06.500
So this alone isn't good enough
for an article.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.041
I'm sorry.

09:09.625 --> 09:12.208
I'm looking for more definitive evidence.

09:14.708 --> 09:16.250
<i>We need to be</i>

09:16.750 --> 09:20.375
<i>more careful about how the press reports</i>
<i>the news and their morals.</i>

09:21.000 --> 09:24.916
<i>I think we should reassess</i>
<i>our press system as a whole.</i>

09:25.000 --> 09:28.166
<i>The other day, an article came out</i>
<i>about how a life was lost</i>

09:28.666 --> 09:32.708
<i>due to the aggressive journalism</i>
<i>of a Touto News reporter.</i>

09:33.416 --> 09:35.000
Mrs. Mayumi, could you create a password?

09:36.125 --> 09:39.500
<i>That lot are really very violent.</i>

09:40.166 --> 09:42.916
<i>They just want to get a scoop,</i>
<i>whatever the cost.</i>

09:43.000 --> 09:44.291
Thank you.

09:45.458 --> 09:46.791
<i>Their way of thinking is</i>

09:46.875 --> 09:49.833
<i>more like that of activists</i>
<i>than journalists.</i>

09:55.750 --> 09:57.125
Don't worry about me.

09:57.833 --> 09:59.500
I'm used to the criticism.

10:01.583 --> 10:03.750
Ignorance is frightening.

10:04.958 --> 10:09.583
Not long ago,
I said the same thing as that man.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.708
It's our fault in the press
that we're perceived that way.

10:18.500 --> 10:19.541
There.

10:19.625 --> 10:21.541
Now you have an account.

10:24.083 --> 10:26.458
Let's get more people
on our side to support us.

10:27.125 --> 10:28.208
Right.

10:29.166 --> 10:31.250
The rest is up to you to write.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.875
<i>Now then, Mr. Kinoshita.</i>

10:52.375 --> 10:53.208
Yes?

10:54.375 --> 10:57.291
Tell us why you decided
to apply for a job at Touto News.

10:58.166 --> 10:59.208
Yes, sir.

11:04.583 --> 11:05.583
Until now,

11:06.916 --> 11:10.791
I wasn't at all interested
in newspapers or politics.

11:13.125 --> 11:16.541
That's because I thought
I alone couldn't possibly change anything.

11:18.250 --> 11:22.625
Even now,
I still pretty much believe that.

11:23.541 --> 11:25.916
Then why did you apply for a job with us?

11:28.583 --> 11:29.625
I am…

11:33.791 --> 11:37.375
the nephew of the man who killed himself
over the Eishin Academy affair…

11:39.375 --> 11:41.250
that your journalist,
Ms. Matsuda, is covering.

11:44.958 --> 11:45.958
Ms. Matsuda…

11:47.958 --> 11:50.875
is still vigorously pursuing
my uncle's story

11:52.041 --> 11:54.541
even though society
is trying to forget it.

11:56.875 --> 11:58.750
After seeing how Ms. Matsuda strives

11:59.583 --> 12:03.333
to give a voice to the voiceless
no matter how difficult it may be,

12:04.625 --> 12:06.875
I became interested
in becoming a journalist.

12:11.083 --> 12:12.583
Thanks to her, my aunt is

12:14.416 --> 12:16.208
gradually returning to normal.

12:19.166 --> 12:22.541
If I can also be of service to someone
in the way that she has been,

12:23.458 --> 12:25.250
I'd like to do this kind of work.

12:27.375 --> 12:30.625
I would like to give a clear voice
to those people in society

12:32.250 --> 12:34.000
who are oppressed and downtrodden.

12:37.041 --> 12:38.166
That is why

12:39.541 --> 12:41.250
I applied to work at your company.

12:46.958 --> 12:47.916
Thank you.

12:48.583 --> 12:49.625
Please sit down.

12:59.083 --> 13:00.625
MAYUMI SUZUKI

13:00.708 --> 13:05.666
PLEASE HELP MAKE SURE WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY HUSBAND DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN

13:19.333 --> 13:20.375
I'm back.

13:20.458 --> 13:24.541
Hey, Ryo. Mayu got a job offer.

13:24.625 --> 13:25.458
What?

13:29.208 --> 13:30.958
-You did?
-Yes.

13:31.458 --> 13:32.500
From who?

13:33.541 --> 13:36.666
A mid-sized start-up
that was, like, my seventh choice.

13:37.333 --> 13:38.333
Is that so?

13:39.291 --> 13:40.833
Congratulations.

13:41.625 --> 13:42.958
You keep trying too, Ryo.

13:43.041 --> 13:43.875
I will.

13:56.750 --> 13:58.000
Sorry about the other day.

14:02.458 --> 14:05.125
No. It's all right.

14:08.125 --> 14:11.333
I mean, I hadn't told you about it.

14:14.750 --> 14:15.708
Say…

14:21.083 --> 14:22.458
let's go back together.

14:26.208 --> 14:27.708
I mean, I just got good news.

14:29.708 --> 14:30.666
Ryo!

14:31.291 --> 14:33.750
Congratulate her properly.

14:35.458 --> 14:37.083
That's right.

14:37.916 --> 14:39.875
I want you to congratulate me properly.

14:42.375 --> 14:43.333
Fine, I will.

14:48.333 --> 14:51.541
Doing this kind of thing in the morning
can ruin the whole day.

14:53.458 --> 14:55.708
I've always wanted to try this once.

14:56.583 --> 14:59.375
Yes, I guess it's all right.

15:00.583 --> 15:01.875
Anyway, congratulations.

15:02.375 --> 15:03.291
Thank you.

15:06.875 --> 15:07.916
What about you, Ryo?

15:08.666 --> 15:10.291
Have you decided where to apply?

15:11.625 --> 15:12.458
Yes.

15:15.291 --> 15:16.166
Actually…

15:20.250 --> 15:22.666
I'm thinking about becoming
a newspaper reporter.

15:23.166 --> 15:25.791
-What?
-Don't be so surprised.

15:26.750 --> 15:29.208
But you said nobody reads newspapers!

15:29.875 --> 15:30.791
Right.

15:32.708 --> 15:33.541
Well…

15:36.791 --> 15:38.583
a lot has happened.

15:41.291 --> 15:44.416
I met the lady
you told me about, Ms. Matsuda.

15:45.708 --> 15:46.750
Ms. Matsuda.

15:50.666 --> 15:53.125
A while back,
I said some mean stuff about her.

15:54.333 --> 15:55.666
What is she like?

15:59.416 --> 16:03.416
I don't know her that well yet.
But she's a really nice person.

16:05.708 --> 16:06.791
She's passionate.

16:08.958 --> 16:10.083
And she has compassion.

16:11.833 --> 16:15.125
But who knows? She could be totally evil.

16:23.333 --> 16:25.125
Yes, you could be right.

16:32.708 --> 16:34.958
Lately, I've come to the realization that…

16:37.250 --> 16:41.125
depending on your position,
people can seem either good or evil.

16:48.791 --> 16:51.041
You stay just the way you are, Ryo.

16:52.375 --> 16:53.791
What do you mean by that?

16:55.125 --> 16:56.958
I'll always be me.
You don't have to tell me to.

16:59.291 --> 17:01.208
-Oh, is that right?
-Yes.

17:11.625 --> 17:16.208
I'm sorry for suddenly contacting you.

17:22.750 --> 17:23.625
I read…

17:26.166 --> 17:27.583
his suicide note.

17:33.125 --> 17:36.000
I'm sorry that I haven't been able
to properly apologize.

17:38.500 --> 17:40.291
I am truly sorry.

17:45.791 --> 17:47.333
I heard that…

17:49.250 --> 17:54.250
everyone involved in
my husband's case received a promotion.

17:58.125 --> 17:59.166
He always…

18:01.166 --> 18:03.208
spoke proudly about his work.

18:06.291 --> 18:10.500
"National civil servants
are employed by the citizens of Japan."

18:12.208 --> 18:14.291
"Doing our best to serve the people is…

18:16.583 --> 18:18.375
what makes me proud."

18:23.250 --> 18:24.500
He…

18:27.041 --> 18:30.208
respected you to the very end.

18:37.208 --> 18:41.916
Mr. Kurosaki, you were also given orders
by the higher-ups, weren't you?

18:50.416 --> 18:53.666
No matter what I say,
it will all sound like excuses.

18:59.458 --> 19:01.416
I have been unable to repay him for…

19:03.500 --> 19:05.125
his trust in me.

19:25.375 --> 19:27.541
When I met Suzuki for the last time,

19:29.500 --> 19:30.791
he entrusted this to me.

19:44.958 --> 19:48.125
I wasn't able to live up

19:49.083 --> 19:51.125
to Suzuki's expectations of me.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.000
And most of all,

19:54.791 --> 19:56.875
I let him die.

20:02.750 --> 20:03.625
I am…

20:06.916 --> 20:09.125
truly sorry about that.

AUDIO RECORD ABOUT EISHIN ACADEMY

20:34.333 --> 20:37.125
<i>This year on Wednesday, February 13,</i>

20:38.125 --> 20:40.458
<i>Chubu Local</i>
<i>Finance Bureau Chief Mr. Kitano</i>

20:41.583 --> 20:43.708
<i>called his subordinates together</i>
<i>at around 8:00 p.m.</i>

20:43.791 --> 20:45.708
<i>to issue the first order</i>
<i>to alter the documents.</i>

20:46.416 --> 20:50.041
<i>Finance Bureau Director-General Mr. Mouri</i>
<i>came from Tokyo.</i>

20:50.750 --> 20:54.708
<i>The five of us in Property Administration</i>
<i>at Chubu Local Finance Bureau</i>

20:54.791 --> 20:58.000
<i>were ordered to alter documents</i>

20:58.583 --> 21:03.000
<i>that were inconsistent with the statement</i>
<i>of the prime minister in the Diet.</i>

21:04.416 --> 21:08.500
<i>The documents were altered</i>
<i>on Thursday, February 14.</i>

21:09.083 --> 21:10.250
<i>We were ordered to</i>

21:10.333 --> 21:14.583
<i>remove the names of the First Lady</i>
<i>and other Members of Parliament</i>

21:14.666 --> 21:18.083
<i>so the documents were consistent</i>
<i>with what was said in Parliament.</i>

21:18.166 --> 21:19.916
<i>Supervisor Kurosaki</i>

21:20.000 --> 21:23.416
<i>-submitted the altered documents</i>…
-Kazuya…

21:23.500 --> 21:25.666
<i>…to Chubu Local</i>
<i>Finance Bureau Chief Mr. Kitano.</i>

21:25.750 --> 21:27.541
You're so meticulous.

21:27.625 --> 21:30.000
<i>On Monday, February 18,</i>

21:30.083 --> 21:32.041
<i>we were called together</i>
<i>at around 8:30 a.m.</i>

21:52.583 --> 21:54.583
<i>He said we must do as ordered,</i>

21:55.083 --> 21:58.833
<i>so we altered</i>
<i>and destroyed official documents.</i>

21:59.916 --> 22:03.708
<i>There are detailed records</i>
<i>of the meeting, so it appears</i>

22:04.291 --> 22:08.500
<i>Eishin Academy was given special treatment</i>
<i>by the Ministry of Finance.</i>

22:09.208 --> 22:10.166
<i>Or at least,</i>

22:10.250 --> 22:13.041
<i>to prevent the appearance</i>
<i>of special treatment,</i>

22:13.666 --> 22:17.375
<i>it was made to look like Finance Bureau</i>
<i>Director-General Mouri made the decision.</i>

22:18.000 --> 22:19.083
Amazing.

22:20.833 --> 22:23.000
This will be a huge story for sure.

22:24.291 --> 22:25.333
It will?

22:27.083 --> 22:28.666
Boss, we can print this, right?

22:34.500 --> 22:36.041
Does anyone else have this?

22:36.833 --> 22:41.208
Only we and Kazuya's superior,
Mr. Kurosaki, know about it.

22:48.333 --> 22:50.291
Are you still going
to give in to pressure?

22:53.333 --> 22:56.083
Boss, this is a sure thing!

23:09.083 --> 23:11.166
Let's put this on tomorrow's front page.

23:16.166 --> 23:18.125
This is a huge scoop.

23:19.208 --> 23:20.291
We'll go big with it.

23:22.416 --> 23:23.583
Give her whatever she needs.

23:23.666 --> 23:24.500
Got it.

23:29.541 --> 23:30.458
Mrs. Mayumi.

23:32.166 --> 23:33.666
You're sure about this?

23:35.333 --> 23:37.375
Releasing this to the public

23:38.666 --> 23:41.291
could cause you suffering.

23:46.916 --> 23:48.083
I'm prepared for that.

23:50.000 --> 23:54.541
I believe this is the best way
to honor my husband.

24:12.291 --> 24:13.833
THE SALE OF PUBLIC LAND

24:13.916 --> 24:15.750
TO EISHIN ACADEMY EDUCATIONAL CORPORATION…

24:24.166 --> 24:25.666
MR. SUZUKI STRONGLY PROTESTED…

24:28.250 --> 24:29.333
"A second time."

24:30.125 --> 24:31.458
"The published…"

24:31.541 --> 24:34.208
"Was forced to…"

24:34.291 --> 24:35.833
"Was forced to do the work…"

24:36.541 --> 24:39.458
We're putting the Eishin scandal
on the front page.

24:39.541 --> 24:41.041
-Got it.
-Good. Work quickly.

24:41.125 --> 24:42.125
-Right.
-Thanks.

24:42.208 --> 24:43.083
EISHIN ACADEMY SCANDAL

SUICIDE NOTE OF DECEASED EMPLOYEE REVEALED

25:27.750 --> 25:29.791
SUICIDE NOTE OF DECEASED EMPLOYEE REVEALED

26:00.833 --> 26:01.916
-Here.
-Got it.

26:02.666 --> 26:03.541
-Here.
-Got it.

26:08.458 --> 26:10.250
SUICIDE NOTE OF DECEASED EMPLOYEE REVEALED

28:17.166 --> 28:19.000
SUICIDE NOTE OF DECEASED EMPLOYEE REVEALED

28:45.125 --> 28:46.333
Good morning.

28:50.291 --> 28:52.291
Good morning. Thank you!

28:53.666 --> 28:55.833
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

28:55.916 --> 28:56.958
Thank you.

28:57.041 --> 29:00.166
You did it. Other papers
are sure to rush in to chase it too.

29:01.708 --> 29:04.333
Ms. Matsuda, it's going viral
on social media.

29:04.416 --> 29:08.250
They can't ignore it now.
The administration will fall for sure.

29:08.791 --> 29:10.708
It hasn't worked out that way before.

29:11.541 --> 29:13.958
Maybe so, but this time
it's sure to happen.

29:14.041 --> 29:16.500
There's no doubt
the PM's office will respond.

29:17.291 --> 29:20.333
You'll probably be targeted again.

29:24.958 --> 29:28.375
I'll be fine.
This is when the real fight begins.

29:45.916 --> 29:48.541
Hello. It's been a while.

29:49.583 --> 29:51.583
I've got something I'd like to ask you.

29:53.541 --> 29:57.083
<i>The handwritten suicide note states that</i>
<i>Finance Bureau Director-General Mouri</i>

29:57.583 --> 30:01.291
<i>gave orders to alter documents</i>
<i>three times.</i>

30:01.833 --> 30:03.541
<i>It reveals information</i>
<i>not in the Ministry…</i>

30:16.666 --> 30:18.291
Thank you for calling.

30:18.375 --> 30:21.291
How are you doing?
Getting along all right?

30:22.958 --> 30:23.916
Yes, I am.

30:24.458 --> 30:28.208
<i>As I'm sure you know,</i>
<i>the Eishin affair has become big news.</i>

30:29.958 --> 30:32.416
Yes, I am aware of it.

30:33.666 --> 30:34.625
It's possible

30:36.333 --> 30:38.083
the prosecutor's office might investigate.

30:40.333 --> 30:43.250
What should I do?

30:44.208 --> 30:46.666
<i>It won't be easy,</i>
<i>but don't worry about it.</i>

30:47.916 --> 30:49.666
<i>Keep doing as you've done until now.</i>

30:53.125 --> 30:54.208
Are you sure?

30:55.125 --> 30:55.958
What's wrong?

30:59.041 --> 31:01.041
Do you plan on changing your testimony?

31:02.958 --> 31:03.958
<i>No.</i>

31:06.958 --> 31:07.916
Don't worry.

31:10.666 --> 31:13.541
The government certainly won't allow
any evidence to get out.

31:13.625 --> 31:17.208
But if some unexpected evidence
were found,

31:19.583 --> 31:21.875
the government would protect me, right?

31:23.125 --> 31:24.208
<i>Of course.</i>

31:25.458 --> 31:29.833
<i>As long as you carry out your role</i>
<i>as a bureaucrat to the very end.</i>

31:33.500 --> 31:36.625
I'm counting on you. Okay?

31:47.750 --> 31:48.791
I see.

31:49.916 --> 31:51.125
Thank you.

31:51.958 --> 31:52.958
TETSUSHI SASAKI LAW FIRM

31:53.041 --> 31:56.166
Ms. Matsuda told me
a little bit over the phone.

31:56.250 --> 31:58.333
What do you plan to do now?

32:00.875 --> 32:04.250
I was hoping I could take them to court.

32:04.916 --> 32:05.958
I see.

32:06.833 --> 32:09.708
I want everything
to come out into the open.

32:11.375 --> 32:13.791
Unless we can get to the root cause

32:14.791 --> 32:18.458
of why my husband was involved
in a cover-up, there's no point in this.

32:20.500 --> 32:21.833
I see.

32:25.333 --> 32:26.958
You don't think it can be done?

32:27.791 --> 32:29.916
This case was dropped once already,

32:30.000 --> 32:32.583
but it isn't completely impossible.

32:33.625 --> 32:36.208
If there is more definitive proof,
that could change things.

32:38.916 --> 32:41.916
You mean proof that
the prime minister was involved?

32:42.000 --> 32:42.875
Right.

32:44.458 --> 32:47.666
If this suicide note and memoir
are turned over to the public prosecutor,

32:47.750 --> 32:49.625
they might reopen the investigation.

32:50.125 --> 32:52.041
Would you like me to speak with them?

32:52.541 --> 32:54.125
Yes, I would appreciate that.

33:03.125 --> 33:05.208
<i>This situation has become exasperating.</i>

33:06.625 --> 33:09.208
They've really messed things up.

33:10.458 --> 33:12.458
If this public uproar continues,

33:12.541 --> 33:15.750
the public prosecutor could come
to question you, Murakami.

33:17.750 --> 33:18.625
I see.

33:18.708 --> 33:23.208
At any rate, we need to suppress
as much information as we can.

33:23.791 --> 33:24.708
Yes.

33:25.708 --> 33:27.291
But how can we do that?

33:27.375 --> 33:32.125
Now that there's such a commotion,
CIRO can't possibly deal with it alone.

33:32.958 --> 33:35.791
You can only do so much. Isn't that right?

33:36.833 --> 33:37.875
Well…

33:39.000 --> 33:43.125
We need someone of your status
to take action, Mr. Nakagawa.

33:44.125 --> 33:46.333
You did the same
for the Olympic bid, right?

33:47.458 --> 33:50.166
We'll get the heads
of every media outlet on our side.

33:50.250 --> 33:52.708
I'll get you in touch with them.
Let's do the same again.

33:53.666 --> 33:54.916
What should we do?

33:56.500 --> 33:59.291
Dig deep into the lives
of the media outlet heads.

34:00.500 --> 34:04.166
Find out all you can,
even about their families,

34:04.250 --> 34:05.666
no matter how trivial it is.

34:07.291 --> 34:09.583
It all depends on
how much dirt we can get on them.

34:10.541 --> 34:13.958
You'd like us
to tighten the screws on them?

34:15.000 --> 34:16.208
Immediately.

34:17.250 --> 34:18.208
Certainly.

34:35.416 --> 34:36.833
<i>…said in Parliament.</i>

34:36.916 --> 34:40.541
<i>National Property Administrator,</i>
<i>Supervisor Kurosaki,</i>

34:40.625 --> 34:42.541
<i>submitted the altered documents</i>

34:42.625 --> 34:44.958
<i>to Chubu Local</i>
<i>Finance Bureau Chief Mr. Kitano.</i>

34:46.291 --> 34:48.916
<i>On Monday, February 18,</i>

34:49.000 --> 34:50.208
<i>we were called together…</i>

34:50.291 --> 34:53.458
What do you think?

34:57.458 --> 35:02.000
Why wasn't everyone prosecuted
in the first place?

35:04.250 --> 35:07.500
I am not at liberty to answer that.

35:12.041 --> 35:14.500
However, before your husband died,

35:16.375 --> 35:18.583
I told him I could not ignore this case.

35:19.541 --> 35:20.416
What?

35:22.000 --> 35:23.333
I know it's a little late now,

35:25.166 --> 35:27.208
but now I feel like I could

35:29.041 --> 35:30.958
help with what Kazuya Suzuki wanted,

35:32.625 --> 35:34.416
which I wasn't able to do before.

35:41.208 --> 35:43.541
Thank you for these materials.

35:45.750 --> 35:47.750
I will perform a thorough investigation.

35:51.333 --> 35:53.125
TOUTO NEWS

35:53.208 --> 35:54.750
<i>Mr. Ryo Kinoshita.</i>

35:58.833 --> 36:01.625
I heard that you are
the nephew of Mr. Kazuya Suzuki.

36:04.416 --> 36:05.250
That's right.

36:06.208 --> 36:08.750
I also heard
you don't read the paper much.

36:11.708 --> 36:13.333
That's right. I'm sorry.

36:15.416 --> 36:19.666
If we hire you,
what kind of work would you like to do?

36:22.916 --> 36:23.958
For people like me

36:25.291 --> 36:30.875
who think the news doesn't concern them
or who have never read a newspaper,

36:31.833 --> 36:34.250
I'd like to write articles
that get them interested.

36:35.208 --> 36:37.208
I'd especially like to get young people

36:38.125 --> 36:41.625
to realize that what happens
in the world concerns them as well.

36:43.916 --> 36:46.208
That's the kind of journalist
I'd like to be.

36:50.166 --> 36:51.291
I'd also

36:52.708 --> 36:56.625
like to have fun
and make it my lifetime profession.

36:59.000 --> 36:59.958
Thank you.

37:07.000 --> 37:07.833
All right,

37:08.625 --> 37:10.958
can I ask you one more question?

37:11.875 --> 37:12.750
Certainly.

37:16.250 --> 37:20.458
How do you think
newspapers should adapt for the future?

37:44.708 --> 37:45.666
<i>Hello?</i>

37:46.166 --> 37:47.708
Hi, Mom.

37:47.791 --> 37:49.166
<i>Hi. What's up?</i>

37:52.583 --> 37:53.875
I got a job offer.

37:53.958 --> 37:55.541
Really? You did?

37:56.291 --> 37:57.125
<i>Yes.</i>

37:57.208 --> 37:59.250
I'll start work at Touto News in spring.

37:59.750 --> 38:02.833
<i>Really? Congratulations!</i>

38:02.916 --> 38:05.458
<i>So you'll be working with Ms. Matsuda?</i>

38:06.791 --> 38:07.791
Maybe.

38:09.041 --> 38:11.291
I don't know exactly
where I'll be assigned yet.

38:11.833 --> 38:13.000
<i>Oh, right.</i>

38:13.083 --> 38:14.750
Hold on. I'll put my sister on.

38:19.375 --> 38:20.750
Hello. Ryo?

38:22.500 --> 38:23.333
Congratulations.

38:23.416 --> 38:24.250
<i>Thank you.</i>

38:25.916 --> 38:27.875
Tell Uncle Kazuya for me.

38:29.583 --> 38:30.416
I will.

38:32.333 --> 38:33.375
Good luck.

38:35.291 --> 38:36.375
You too, Aunt Mayumi.

38:39.250 --> 38:40.375
Thank you.

38:40.458 --> 38:41.375
<i>Yeah.</i>

38:42.291 --> 38:44.458
<i>-Bye.</i>
-See you.

38:50.125 --> 38:51.708
What great news!

39:02.625 --> 39:07.250
FOUR MONTHS LATER

39:12.750 --> 39:14.708
-Good morning.
-Morning.

39:14.791 --> 39:16.583
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

39:19.000 --> 39:22.375
You two will be graduating soon,
won't you?

39:23.458 --> 39:25.916
No slacking off.
Keep working hard to the very end.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.708
-Okay.
-Yes, I know.

39:27.791 --> 39:33.041
It makes me happy to think that someday,
I'll deliver a paper written by Ryo.

39:34.208 --> 39:37.375
If you write garbage articles,
we'll poke fun at you here.

39:38.083 --> 39:41.291
-Just warning you.
-Oh, come on. Quit that.

39:49.833 --> 39:52.833
"First case of community spread
in Japan confirmed."

39:54.750 --> 39:55.583
What's wrong?

39:56.458 --> 40:00.583
Oh, it's just that there's been more news
about this lately. It worries me.

40:01.083 --> 40:03.125
That? We'll be just fine.

40:03.208 --> 40:05.958
They're making a big deal
out of nothing but a typical cold.

40:06.041 --> 40:09.000
Don't talk like that.
You need to be careful.

40:09.083 --> 40:10.666
Really?

40:33.916 --> 40:34.791
This looks fine.

40:35.833 --> 40:39.750
It won't be long before Mr. Nakagawa
starts meeting with these people.

40:39.833 --> 40:42.625
Make sure you complete
personal investigations of them by then.

40:45.833 --> 40:47.208
Mr. Tada.

40:50.500 --> 40:51.375
What is it?

40:54.166 --> 40:56.958
Do you really think investigating
the lives of private citizens

40:57.041 --> 40:59.958
and pressuring them
will help maintain national stability?

41:08.208 --> 41:09.916
What do you mean by that?

41:11.500 --> 41:13.916
Now that public opinion
has been swayed this far,

41:17.000 --> 41:19.041
it will be almost impossible to stop it.

41:19.125 --> 41:21.458
Since you directly requested
the discounted price from Mouri,

41:21.541 --> 41:24.875
do you think you can solve this
by apologizing to the citizens of Japan?

41:25.458 --> 41:26.458
Not at all.

41:28.791 --> 41:33.708
-I was just doing my job.
-You're wrong.

41:35.166 --> 41:38.833
This problem was caused because
you assumed what the First Lady wanted.

41:38.916 --> 41:41.958
If you hadn't
arbitrarily negotiated a discounted price,

41:42.041 --> 41:44.416
Mouri wouldn't have needed to resign,

41:44.500 --> 41:47.541
and the Chubu Local Finance Bureau
employee wouldn't have died,

41:47.625 --> 41:50.333
and this wouldn't have grown
into such a huge problem.

41:52.791 --> 41:54.291
What? I…

41:54.375 --> 41:55.375
Mr. Tada…

41:56.041 --> 41:57.125
All of this…

42:00.375 --> 42:03.208
was a scheme concocted by you alone.

42:07.458 --> 42:11.000
That's ridiculous. You must be kidding.

42:11.083 --> 42:13.500
Mr. Tada, I…

42:13.583 --> 42:17.458
It is possible to make that the truth.

42:24.750 --> 42:27.291
All you need to think about
is protecting the system.

42:27.791 --> 42:28.833
Get back to work.

42:34.416 --> 42:35.416
I'll go now.

42:43.000 --> 42:43.833
Wait.

42:45.083 --> 42:47.000
-One more thing, Murakami.
-Yes?

42:49.125 --> 42:53.541
The stability of your family is also
dependent on the stability of the nation.

43:18.833 --> 43:21.625
<i>This problem was caused because</i>

43:21.708 --> 43:23.791
Daddy! Welcome home!

43:23.875 --> 43:26.541
-Welcome home!
-Thank you.

43:26.625 --> 43:30.541

Yes, a rabbit.

43:41.916 --> 43:43.291

43:46.666 --> 43:49.333

43:49.916 --> 43:50.750
No, I didn't.

44:04.125 --> 44:07.625
Hayato, you're spilling things.

44:10.333 --> 44:12.416
-Here. Wipe it up.
-Okay.

44:13.583 --> 44:15.000
Eat up your carrots.

44:43.250 --> 44:50.250
PHOTO SENT

44:58.333 --> 45:00.166
I KNOW YOUR BROTHER

45:03.958 --> 45:05.375
What is this?

45:15.583 --> 45:17.208
ARE YOU WITH THE PM'S OFFICE?

45:23.625 --> 45:26.333
ARE YOU WITH THE PM'S OFFICE?

48:02.041 --> 48:06.541
