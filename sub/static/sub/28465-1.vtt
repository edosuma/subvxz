[Frank] Wow.

01:05.655 --> 01:07.923
Seems just like yesterday
I was pushing you on the swings

01:07.925 --> 01:09.590
in Gardner Park.

01:09.592 --> 01:11.025
[Nancy] Yeah.

01:11.027 --> 01:13.861
And now, look
at our college girl,

01:13.863 --> 01:16.732
on her way to becoming
a veterinarian.

01:16.734 --> 01:19.601
Now, baby.
We're just a phone call away,

01:19.603 --> 01:22.570
five-hour car ride away,
50-minute plane ride away.

01:22.572 --> 01:24.638
You know we're there for you,
anything you need.

01:24.640 --> 01:25.539
You have our numbers.

01:25.541 --> 01:28.610
Yes, I practically
have them memorized.

01:28.612 --> 01:29.611
- [Nancy] Good.
- But, don't call

01:29.613 --> 01:32.680
after 10:00 p.m.
'cause we'll probably be asleep.

01:32.682 --> 01:34.448
That was a joke.
You know that was a joke, right?

01:34.450 --> 01:37.119
[laughs]
I love your jokes, Daddy.

01:37.121 --> 01:39.787
- [Nancy] Do you like your bed?
- Yeah.

01:39.789 --> 01:41.822
We should have gotten her
a better mattress.

01:41.824 --> 01:42.891
How come we didn't think
of that?

01:42.893 --> 01:44.992
You know what this room needs,
is a Medeco lock.

01:44.994 --> 01:46.594
Medeco makes a very sturdy lock.

01:46.596 --> 01:47.661
- Yeah.
- And what's with this

01:47.663 --> 01:48.963
co-ed dorm?
Why are we doing that?

01:48.965 --> 01:50.798
She's in a co-ed dorm,
whose idea was that?

01:50.800 --> 01:52.501
That's wrong.

01:52.503 --> 01:54.438
I love you guys so much.

01:55.606 --> 01:56.741

Hey, man.

I'm just doing my job,

[Frank] We, uh...

03:52.523 --> 03:54.255
we just dropped our daughter
off at college,

03:54.257 --> 03:55.624
and we've been
really, really busy,

[Frank] There...
there is a backstory here.

04:06.602 --> 04:09.237
Always is, brother. Always is.

Would you like to hear it?

[driver sighs]

04:16.547 --> 04:18.112
All right, shoot.

04:18.113 --> 04:20.081
I started a medical company.

04:20.083 --> 04:23.117
Put everything we had into it,
making a medical innovation

04:25.888 --> 04:28.256
We rolled the dice hard,

04:28.258 --> 04:29.658
Then there was a problem.

04:29.660 --> 04:31.893
Small, but enough
for some news stories.

04:31.895 --> 04:33.895
They started calling us
"controversial,"

04:33.897 --> 04:35.564
which is the toughest word
in our business,

04:35.566 --> 04:36.831
and it's been...

04:36.833 --> 04:38.732
bad dominoes ever since.

04:38.734 --> 04:40.802
Now, our daughter doesn't know
at all about this.

04:40.804 --> 04:43.304
We've been holding it together
until she went off to college,

04:43.306 --> 04:45.273
and now we're gonna
hold it together

04:45.275 --> 04:46.844
until we get back on our feet.

04:48.111 --> 04:49.643

- Dual leg artery.

04:56.253 --> 04:57.751
I know.

04:57.753 --> 04:59.789
You know what I used to do
before this repo shit?

05:00.624 --> 05:01.657
- Paramedic.
- Oh?

05:01.659 --> 05:04.626
Yeah. People used to be glad
to see me show up.

05:04.628 --> 05:06.961

three child seats

05:06.963 --> 05:08.730

05:23.914 --> 05:26.381
Shit. Okay, look.

05:26.383 --> 05:27.581
I'll tell 'em you weren't here.

05:27.583 --> 05:31.052
But the most I can get you
is days, not weeks. All right?

05:31.054 --> 05:32.821
So, if I were you,

05:32.823 --> 05:34.823
I'd find a way
to put some loot in my suit.

05:34.825 --> 05:37.124

05:59.415 --> 06:01.182
It's broken.

06:01.184 --> 06:03.050
So, we sell it, uh,

06:03.052 --> 06:04.352
as is, or we fix it?

06:04.354 --> 06:07.122
We don't fix things, Frank,
we only ruin them...

06:08.758 --> 06:10.992

espresso machine.

06:21.772 --> 06:24.372
And we just had to have it.

06:24.374 --> 06:28.710
But, we never even took it out
of the damn box.

06:28.712 --> 06:30.944
Just be happy that the thing
is still in the box,

06:30.946 --> 06:33.814
it's worth 2,000 dollars,
one-eighth of that is,

06:33.816 --> 06:35.083
it's a... it's a car payment.

06:35.085 --> 06:37.018
Why did we get all this stuff?

06:37.020 --> 06:39.787
Stuff, stuff, stuff everywhere,

06:39.789 --> 06:43.158
and I can't even afford
to get my roots done

06:43.160 --> 06:44.893
or get a bikini wax.

06:44.895 --> 06:47.061
Hey, guys!
You're having a yard sale?

06:47.063 --> 06:48.730

It sounds like
she made it off fine.

were trying to make

to him, Jason.

Hey, Jason, do you wear
your Staples uniform

07:24.133 --> 07:25.766
under your clothes
like Superman,

07:25.768 --> 07:27.235
or do you go home
and change at your mom's,

Mr. Teagarten, I'd really like
to get along with you,

07:41.518 --> 07:43.251
even if Rachel and I
are eventually just friends,

07:43.253 --> 07:44.319
nothing more,

'cause I... I think you guys
are amazing people.

07:46.890 --> 07:48.323
Thank you, Jason.

07:48.325 --> 07:50.891
- Have a nice day.
- Yeah.

[Frank] Enjoy the ride.

08:28.164 --> 08:29.163
while I have you on the phone,

08:29.165 --> 08:31.833
I think I need to ask you
for more money...

08:31.835 --> 08:32.832
to watch the house.

08:32.835 --> 08:34.501
'Cause I'm over there

08:42.011 --> 08:43.812
<i>just so he can go in
and watch cable.</i>

08:43.813 --> 08:45.012
Jesus.

08:45.014 --> 08:47.181
What did he say
about more money?

08:47.183 --> 08:48.351
I don't think he's into it.

09:30.426 --> 09:32.961
Yes, I am going to pay you soon.

09:32.963 --> 09:34.062
Uh, no, I don't know when,

09:34.064 --> 09:37.265
but your credit card
is very important to me, so I...

09:37.267 --> 09:40.034
Oh, yes, I know that, but...
[sighs]

09:40.036 --> 09:41.602
Well, I do wanna work with you,
so how about this?

09:41.604 --> 09:42.538
I'll send you the credit card,

09:42.540 --> 09:45.106
and you just shove it up
your fucking ass.

Yes.

09:56.952 --> 09:58.288
Yes. Yes.

10:02.325 --> 10:03.491
[Nancy] Absolutely not.

10:03.493 --> 10:05.093
It's a Chateau Latour.

10:05.095 --> 10:06.928
It's worth 800 dollars.

10:06.930 --> 10:08.328
Have you lost your mind?

10:08.330 --> 10:10.198
Wait a minute.

10:10.200 --> 10:12.333
Since when
did you start smoking?

10:12.335 --> 10:13.468
- Just now.
- [scoffs]

10:13.470 --> 10:14.935
Great timing.

10:14.937 --> 10:16.670
Just when we can't afford it.

10:16.672 --> 10:18.673
Nigel has hundreds
of bottles of wine.

10:18.675 --> 10:19.741
He doesn't need more wine.

10:19.743 --> 10:22.043
He needs a punch in the face,
but not more wine.

10:22.045 --> 10:23.578
[Nancy] Would you please
have some decency?

10:23.580 --> 10:26.213
You're supposed to be looking
after his property,

10:26.215 --> 10:28.482
not parting it out
like an old Chevy.

10:28.484 --> 10:30.117
- What?
- I mean, what's next?

10:30.119 --> 10:33.987
You gonna put an... an ad
on Craigslist and rent it out?

10:33.989 --> 10:35.122
[sighs]

10:35.124 --> 10:37.157
Rent out his house?

10:37.159 --> 10:39.863
Rent out Nigel's house?
On Craigslist?

10:40.696 --> 10:41.963
That's insane.

10:41.965 --> 10:43.931
[Nancy] Stop changing
the subject.

10:43.933 --> 10:46.633
Put that bottle of wine back.

10:46.635 --> 10:48.001
Right now.

Bob and Teresa?

From the Philippines.

11:27.042 --> 11:30.144
They used to strap
coca tree bark to their bodies

11:30.146 --> 11:31.578
before they went to battle.

11:31.580 --> 11:35.516
The coca then, would leech
into their bloodstream,

11:35.518 --> 11:37.517
and get them amped up

11:37.519 --> 11:40.188
to help them overcome
the fear of war.

11:40.190 --> 11:43.190
Frank, we're at war.

about this house?

13:37.373 --> 13:38.506
I'm sorry?

13:38.508 --> 13:42.376
There was a rental ad
for this house on Craigslist,

but no one's answering
the doorbell.

13:44.513 --> 13:46.447

[Carl] Yeah.

For Nigel's house?

13:50.220 --> 13:53.420
No, somebody named Frank?

within a designated area.

19:48.744 --> 19:50.478
So we'll be going
house to house.

19:50.480 --> 19:51.912
It's kind of like
trick or treating,

19:51.914 --> 19:53.746
except for we don't get candy,

19:53.748 --> 19:55.982
we tell people I'm a pedophile.

19:55.984 --> 19:58.219
I'm sorry, I'm having trouble
with my ears.

19:58.221 --> 20:01.821
There's a really loud sound
to them, like a...

20:01.823 --> 20:04.959
like a roaring
crashing ocean, so...

20:04.961 --> 20:06.659
What the fuck did you just say?

20:06.661 --> 20:08.261
[Nancy] Baby, tell little Frank

20:08.263 --> 20:09.963
that I'm here, that I'm ready.

20:09.965 --> 20:11.065
Baby, get away from the door!

20:11.067 --> 20:12.132
[screams]

20:12.134 --> 20:14.501
[speaking in Spanish]

20:14.503 --> 20:15.769
Wow. Frank.
[chuckles]

20:15.771 --> 20:17.474
You really did well.

20:19.207 --> 20:21.774
[Frank] I did not
see that coming.

20:21.776 --> 20:24.944
[Nancy] Good.
I'm glad you didn't plan this.

20:24.946 --> 20:27.280
[Frank] Gotta burn down
the house to cook the pig.

20:27.282 --> 20:28.348
[Nancy] What?

20:28.350 --> 20:30.717
[Frank] I'm saying,
"I did not see that coming."

20:30.719 --> 20:32.019
[Nancy] Oh, look.

20:32.021 --> 20:33.654
They're going
to the Templeman's.

20:33.656 --> 20:35.222
Nice people, the Templeman's.

20:35.224 --> 20:37.590
Their lawn is always so green.

20:37.592 --> 20:39.792
I've always wondered
what they use.

20:39.794 --> 20:41.228
Maybe you can call Carl.

20:41.230 --> 20:43.931
You know, the fucking,
fucking sex offender,

20:43.933 --> 20:45.135
and ask him to ask them.

20:46.735 --> 20:48.769
[Frank inhales]

20:48.771 --> 20:51.070
Probably magnesium sulfate.

20:51.072 --> 20:53.706
[Nancy] You realize
we're going to jail, right?

20:53.708 --> 20:55.842
[Frank] No.
Nigel will never press charges,

20:55.844 --> 20:57.978
I've pulled his fat out
of the fire too many times.

20:57.980 --> 21:00.180
Like last month,
his smoke detector was beeping,

21:00.182 --> 21:02.683
I changed the nine-volt,
didn't even charge him.

21:02.685 --> 21:04.117
[Nancy] Snap out of it,
motherfucker.

21:04.119 --> 21:06.252
We're going to jail.

21:06.254 --> 21:08.621
Don't, uh,
forget your prescriptions

21:08.623 --> 21:10.324
and anything else you might need
for the next few weeks.

21:10.326 --> 21:12.559
[Nancy] Frank, help me.

21:12.561 --> 21:14.129
Hold this bag. Hold this bag.

21:16.866 --> 21:19.066
Do you really need
all these panties and such, hun?

21:19.068 --> 21:21.734
No. I'm gonna hide them
in the attic.

21:21.736 --> 21:24.238
I don't want him
going all over my lingerie.

21:24.240 --> 21:25.772
The word is "cumming," honey.
Cumming.

21:25.774 --> 21:26.773
[Nancy] I don't give a damn.

21:26.775 --> 21:30.644
I do not want his DNA
on my private things.

21:30.646 --> 21:32.980
Baby, we really don't know
what he did.

21:32.982 --> 21:34.951
Then you should hide
your panties, too.

21:44.593 --> 21:46.659
Hi.

21:46.661 --> 21:49.896
[Carl] Look, I, I, I know
I should have said something,

21:49.898 --> 21:52.132
but it...
it's not like I told you

21:52.134 --> 21:54.734
I wasn't a registered offender.

21:54.736 --> 21:56.235
Oh, my god, he just said that.

21:56.237 --> 21:57.771
I saw his lips move
and everything.

21:57.773 --> 21:58.972
[Frank] Carl.

21:58.974 --> 22:01.140
Part of me would like to punch
you in the face right now,

22:01.142 --> 22:03.777
but another part of me would
like to kick you in the balls.

22:03.779 --> 22:04.845
Which do you prefer?

22:04.847 --> 22:08.382
Uh, thanks. I... I normally
don't get a choice.

22:08.384 --> 22:11.151
But I, I don't know anything
about your house.

22:11.153 --> 22:14.754
Well, how do I know your house
is as nice as this house?

22:14.756 --> 22:16.857
Our house is gorgeous.

22:16.859 --> 22:19.393
Carl, you don't have a choice.

22:19.395 --> 22:22.128
Our house could be a shack
cantilevered over

22:22.130 --> 22:24.130
hell's septic tank,
and it wouldn't matter.

22:24.132 --> 22:25.398
You either move into our house,

22:25.400 --> 22:29.002
or you're back on the street,
because you cannot stay here.

22:29.004 --> 22:32.905
I guess I could just get
my 25 grand back

22:32.907 --> 22:34.340
and find another place.

22:34.342 --> 22:35.811
[inhales deeply]

22:41.050 --> 22:42.217
You know what?

22:43.019 --> 22:44.184
Fine with me.

22:44.186 --> 22:47.287
Because I'm not even sure
that I want you in my house,

22:47.289 --> 22:50.758
sleeping in our bed,
inside our sheets,

22:50.760 --> 22:53.260
where I sleep naked
all the time.

22:53.262 --> 22:54.328
[Nancy grunts]

22:54.330 --> 22:56.930
And what if he finds
our home videos?

22:56.932 --> 22:59.032
Didn't I tell you
not to film that?

22:59.034 --> 23:01.702
[stammers]
Maybe I can make this work.

23:01.704 --> 23:03.936
Let me... let me run
something by you.

23:03.938 --> 23:06.339
The Swedish Duxiana mattress.

23:06.341 --> 23:09.376
I haven't been able to sleep
one night in it.

23:09.378 --> 23:13.079
I'm not really interested
in mattresses normally,

23:13.081 --> 23:16.817
but this is my one time
for this mattress,

23:16.819 --> 23:18.152
and I'm not even a mattress guy.

23:18.154 --> 23:20.020
- You want the mattress, Carl?
- [Carl] Yeah.

23:20.022 --> 23:21.288
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

23:21.290 --> 23:22.822
You're not getting the mattress.

23:22.824 --> 23:24.191
Have you ever had
your head examined?

23:24.193 --> 23:25.959
What's in there, Pop-Tarts?

23:25.961 --> 23:27.927
"I'm not even a mattress guy."

23:27.929 --> 23:29.229
- [stammers]
- Jesus H. Christ, Carl.

23:29.231 --> 23:32.299
You are not getting
the fucking mattress!

23:32.301 --> 23:34.337
[Carl] Why are we going through
the backyard?

23:35.137 --> 23:36.736
Why is the sky blue?

23:36.738 --> 23:38.004
[Carl] Uh, 'cause sunlight

23:38.006 --> 23:40.240
is refracted
by dust particles in the air

23:40.242 --> 23:43.242
and blue is the dominant color
of the spectrum?

23:43.244 --> 23:45.212
Did you learn that
in the fifth grade,

23:45.214 --> 23:46.780
or from a fifth grader?

23:46.782 --> 23:47.850
[Carl] Ouch.

23:50.386 --> 23:52.051
[Nancy] Baby,
only you would think

23:52.053 --> 23:55.923
of turning Nigel's pool
into our own private drive-in.

23:55.925 --> 23:57.790
[Frank]
Maybe I'm losing my mind.

23:57.792 --> 23:59.492
[both] Aww.

23:59.494 --> 24:01.427
[Nancy] Look at her.

24:01.429 --> 24:03.864
That was Rachel's
fifth-grade play.

24:03.866 --> 24:05.299
She was so good.

24:05.301 --> 24:07.835
Rachel was the best thing in it.
I'm being objective.

24:07.837 --> 24:08.802
I mean, compared to Rachel,

24:08.804 --> 24:10.771
the rest of these kids
were all laughable.

24:10.773 --> 24:14.744
Their screechy voices,
so hard on the ears.

24:16.011 --> 24:18.145
[Nancy] Ah, and there it is.

24:18.147 --> 24:22.515
Janice's grand,
unforgettable party.

24:22.517 --> 24:24.818
Your sister
only threw that party

24:24.820 --> 24:26.753
to prove how rich she is.

24:26.755 --> 24:30.022
You know, I was in
a 98 cents store today.

24:30.024 --> 24:32.158
[sighs]
I bet you anything that Janice

24:32.160 --> 24:35.261
would never set foot
in one of those.

24:35.263 --> 24:37.297
That's only because
she married Dan,

24:37.299 --> 24:40.501
not because
she's any smarter than you.

24:40.503 --> 24:43.236
Do you remember
when we went together?

24:43.238 --> 24:45.505
You were craving Baby Ruths.

24:45.507 --> 24:48.308
I just had to have
that Baby Ruth.

24:48.310 --> 24:50.844
On a hunch,
we bought that pregnancy test

24:50.846 --> 24:53.347
and eight months later,

24:53.349 --> 24:55.918
along came our little Rachel.

24:56.417 --> 24:57.917
To Baby Ruths.

24:57.919 --> 24:59.386
- To Baby Ruths.
- [Frank moans]

24:59.388 --> 25:00.956
[cell phone ringing]

25:02.925 --> 25:03.926
[cell phone beeps]

25:05.226 --> 25:06.292
[in an English accent]
Hello?

25:06.294 --> 25:07.360
[inaudible dialogue on phone]

25:07.362 --> 25:08.965
Mr. Teagarten's not at home.

25:09.465 --> 25:11.063
I'm sorry?

25:11.065 --> 25:12.965
He owes you money?

25:12.967 --> 25:15.836
Well, I'm his butler,
not his accountant,

25:15.838 --> 25:16.936
you fucking ass.

25:16.938 --> 25:18.273
- [inaudible dialogue on phone]
- [cell phone beeps]

25:18.974 --> 25:20.009
[clears throat]

25:21.109 --> 25:22.876
That was Mastercard.

25:22.878 --> 25:26.346
Frank, why don't we sell
our funeral plots?

25:26.348 --> 25:27.848
We can get what,

25:27.850 --> 25:30.149
2,000 dollars at least, right?

25:30.151 --> 25:33.355
Shit, baby, I'm sorry.
School wanted a dorm deposit.

25:34.290 --> 25:35.289
Well, how lovely.

25:35.291 --> 25:38.325
I actually have to pee
really badly right now,

25:38.327 --> 25:40.594
and I would normally
do it right here in the pool,

25:40.596 --> 25:42.799
but I don't wanna make
our problems any worse.

25:44.332 --> 25:45.334
[door closes]

25:48.070 --> 25:49.304
[doorbell rings]

25:51.240 --> 25:52.475
Is that you, Carl?

25:55.476 --> 25:57.144
[man 1] What's up, pervert?

25:57.146 --> 25:58.478
[Frank] What the hell
is going on here?

25:58.480 --> 25:59.579
- [thwacks]
- [Frank grunts]

25:59.581 --> 26:02.182
[Frank] Nancy, Nancy, call 911!

26:02.184 --> 26:03.517
[man 2] Who you talking to?

26:03.519 --> 26:04.885
[Frank] Uh, nobody.

26:04.887 --> 26:06.118
There's nobody else here.

26:06.120 --> 26:07.553
- [thwacks]
- [Frank grunts]

26:07.555 --> 26:10.559
[suspenseful music]

26:13.094 --> 26:14.930
Oh, my god.

26:16.398 --> 26:20.166
[Nancy] Run, run, ISIS has come!

26:20.168 --> 26:22.935
I am... I am neutral!

26:22.937 --> 26:25.606
Put me down! Put me down!

26:25.608 --> 26:28.811
[tense music]

26:30.145 --> 26:31.244
[engine revs]

26:31.246 --> 26:33.115
[tires screech]

26:37.986 --> 26:40.989
[suspenseful music]

26:44.426 --> 26:47.194
[gun cocks]

26:47.196 --> 26:49.562
[man 3] You know what this bitch
was doing when I grabbed her?

26:49.564 --> 26:52.299
Staring at a little girl
in a leotard.

26:52.301 --> 26:54.001
[muffled]
I'm looking at my daughter.

26:54.003 --> 26:56.002
[man 2] The law won't protect
our community

26:56.004 --> 26:57.439
from deviants like you.

26:57.973 --> 26:59.075
We will!

27:00.975 --> 27:03.079
So if we see you
anywhere near...

27:03.646 --> 27:06.245
112 Blue Jay...

27:06.247 --> 27:08.014
- [gunshot]
- [Nancy] Oh, my god!

27:08.016 --> 27:09.619
[crows cawing]

27:14.255 --> 27:15.992
[Nancy] We just escaped death.

27:17.192 --> 27:18.392
They thought you were Carl,

27:18.394 --> 27:20.694
because Carl gave out
Nigel's address.

27:20.696 --> 27:22.095
[Frank yelling]
They thought I was Carl

27:22.097 --> 27:24.063
because he gave out
Nigel's address.

27:24.065 --> 27:26.366
That's what I just said,
why are you screaming?

27:26.368 --> 27:27.667
[Frank] The gunshots!

27:27.669 --> 27:29.339
My ears are, you know.

27:31.240 --> 27:32.539
You know how you know
when your life

27:32.541 --> 27:34.473
is out of control?

27:34.475 --> 27:36.542
When there's a ringing
in your ears

27:36.544 --> 27:39.078
and you don't know
if it's a creditor calling

27:39.080 --> 27:41.181
or a kidnapper
has fired a shotgun

27:41.183 --> 27:43.253
- six inches from your head.
- [horn blaring]

27:48.256 --> 27:50.723
Is that Spanx over tights?

27:50.725 --> 27:52.725
Yes, I'm double spanking.

27:52.727 --> 27:55.031
Do you have to scream it
to the world?

27:56.031 --> 27:57.563
'Cause right about now,

27:57.565 --> 28:00.166
I'd like to have a pair
of really tight Spanx

28:00.168 --> 28:03.136
around my fucking neck!

28:03.138 --> 28:05.973
[Nancy] No, Janice
would never understand.

28:05.975 --> 28:07.139
But she's your sister.

28:07.141 --> 28:09.177
She will ask too many questions.

28:09.978 --> 28:11.511
Our car broke down.

28:11.513 --> 28:12.611
Right.

28:12.613 --> 28:14.213
And I'm barefoot

28:14.215 --> 28:16.383
because we have
the Flintstones car.

28:16.385 --> 28:18.488
and I peddled it like Wilma.

28:22.123 --> 28:23.490
[Frank] What's your guess
on his net worth?

28:23.492 --> 28:25.424
I'd say at least
a hundred million.

28:25.426 --> 28:26.526
It's as high
as two hundred million.

28:26.528 --> 28:28.028
No, that's too high.

28:28.030 --> 28:30.030
At least a hundred million.

28:30.032 --> 28:31.498
He's definitely well fed.

28:31.500 --> 28:32.366
Please, let's go.

28:32.368 --> 28:35.434
She... she'll never buy
our bullshit.

28:35.436 --> 28:38.238
And you can't tell her,
or anybody else for that matter.

28:38.240 --> 28:41.607
That's how this
falling from grace thing works.

28:41.609 --> 28:45.145
People find out, they look away,
they avert their eyes.

28:45.147 --> 28:47.047
Especially our friends.

28:47.049 --> 28:48.447
Are they really
our friends, then?

28:48.449 --> 28:49.348
Nancy, I'm too tired

28:49.350 --> 28:51.119
to have a deep conversation
right now.

28:53.488 --> 28:54.523
But, no.

28:55.357 --> 28:56.455
[Nancy] No, Frank.

28:56.457 --> 28:58.625
Why are you forcing me
to do this?

28:58.627 --> 29:01.194
I cannot take
this shit right now.

29:01.196 --> 29:02.796
I'm gonna get an anxiety attack.

29:02.798 --> 29:04.063
Not Betty.

29:04.065 --> 29:07.099
[Frank] Okay, I understand you
didn't wanna stay at Janice's,

29:07.101 --> 29:08.702
but now you don't wanna stay
at this sister's house?

29:08.704 --> 29:10.302
Look, we have nowhere to go.

29:10.304 --> 29:12.539
Carl's in our house,
we can't go back to Nigel's

29:12.541 --> 29:14.407
'cause those psychos said
they'd kill us,

29:14.409 --> 29:16.643
we don't have any credit cards,
you're barefoot,

29:16.645 --> 29:17.711
and I feel like hell.

29:17.713 --> 29:19.078
[Nancy] Of course, you do.

29:19.080 --> 29:20.680
'Cause we're almost there.

29:20.682 --> 29:22.148
That is hell.

29:22.150 --> 29:23.617
It's like we're in Kansas,

29:23.619 --> 29:26.386
and we're about to get sucked
into a tornado

29:26.388 --> 29:28.621
and drop into an inferno

29:28.623 --> 29:32.192
where Oompa Loompa's
on speed are the gatekeepers.

29:32.194 --> 29:33.626
[Frank] Baby,
I'm gonna need some time

29:33.628 --> 29:35.529
to sort through
all those analogies.

29:35.531 --> 29:37.664
Besides, it's not that bad.

29:37.666 --> 29:39.532
Just smile a lot.

29:39.534 --> 29:42.234
See? Smile. Like this.

29:42.236 --> 29:44.171
Let's see how long that lasts.

29:44.173 --> 29:45.508
[doorbell rings]

29:49.544 --> 29:51.778
- [Nancy] Hi, Tristan.
- [Frank] Hi, Tristan.

29:51.780 --> 29:53.113
Why is she barefoot?

29:53.115 --> 29:54.580
- Uh, Tai Chi.
- Uh...

29:54.582 --> 29:56.116
It's... it's very relaxing.

29:56.118 --> 29:57.651
Uh, can we come in?

29:57.653 --> 30:00.220
- I guess you could come in.
- [door closes]

30:00.222 --> 30:03.255
Dad, Uncle Frank
and Aunt Nancy are here.

30:03.257 --> 30:05.157
That's a really cool
walkie-talkie.

30:05.159 --> 30:06.393
Yeah, well, not to me.

30:06.395 --> 30:09.195
My fucking dad won't spring
for the Ace 10s,

30:09.197 --> 30:10.797
which are way more badass.

30:10.799 --> 30:12.799
- Hm.
- Navy SEALs use Ace 10s.

30:12.801 --> 30:14.800
They also use cool martial arts
like Krav Maga

30:14.802 --> 30:15.868
and cool shit like that.

30:15.870 --> 30:19.106
Tai Chi's for homos,
but you probably knew that.

30:19.108 --> 30:20.773
Smile, Frank.

30:20.775 --> 30:22.675
Oh, hi, Trey.

30:22.677 --> 30:23.777
I wish.

30:23.779 --> 30:27.446
My walkie-talkie is dead
as a used dick.

30:27.448 --> 30:28.848
[Trey] You have
any nine-volt batteries?

30:28.850 --> 30:30.216
- Me?
- Can I search you?

30:30.218 --> 30:31.318
- What?
- Nothing.

30:31.320 --> 30:34.120
Dad, for god sakes,
what is this, a Beckett play?

30:34.122 --> 30:35.754
When did this turn
into <i>Waiting for Godot?</i>

30:35.756 --> 30:38.390
That is quite a reference
for a young lad.

30:38.392 --> 30:40.359
Yeah, I'm Vladimir
and he's Estregon.

30:40.361 --> 30:42.364
- It... it's Estragon.
- [Tristan] Bullshit.

30:43.197 --> 30:44.463
Dad, chop-chop,

30:44.465 --> 30:46.566
the small talk's getting
a little thin out here.

30:46.568 --> 30:47.901
[Bob] <i>All right,
I'm coming, I'm coming,</i>

30:47.903 --> 30:49.435
don't get your panties in a wad.

30:49.437 --> 30:51.570
All hail, Lord Douchington.

30:51.572 --> 30:52.672
- [Frank grunts]
- Hi, Bob.

30:52.674 --> 30:53.839
[Bob] Hey, you made it.

30:53.841 --> 30:55.242
How's the trip?

30:55.244 --> 30:57.376
- Found everything okay?
- [Trey] Douche.

30:57.378 --> 30:59.378
Hey, that's TV for a week, pal.

30:59.380 --> 31:01.117
- Señor Douche.
- Yeah...

31:03.252 --> 31:04.350
God.

31:04.352 --> 31:05.618
Delightful.

31:05.620 --> 31:07.587
Hey, so, Nance,
how come you're barefoot?

31:07.589 --> 31:08.888
You ain't going hippie on me,
are you?

31:08.890 --> 31:10.322
[laughs]
Yeah.

31:10.324 --> 31:11.924
Um, I'm like...

31:11.926 --> 31:14.261
Wilma Flintstone.

31:14.263 --> 31:15.529
Fred was the one who drove.

31:15.531 --> 31:17.563
Wilma just rode shotgun.

31:17.565 --> 31:18.865
She drove sometimes.

31:18.867 --> 31:21.635
So, uh, they're termite tending
your house? What?

31:21.637 --> 31:23.336
Well, yeah, we tried to sleep
in the den,

31:23.338 --> 31:24.370
but there were all these fumes,

31:24.372 --> 31:26.639
and then it was like
we were back in the '60s.

31:26.641 --> 31:27.840
[laughs]

31:27.842 --> 31:28.908
Well, I wouldn't know.

31:28.910 --> 31:30.476
I'm way younger than you are.

31:30.478 --> 31:32.215
Hey, but I do know
the tending game.

31:32.813 --> 31:34.047
We got spiders.

31:34.049 --> 31:36.715
When those spider eggs pop,
those little spiders come out,

31:36.717 --> 31:38.818
they start biting everything
like crazy.

31:38.820 --> 31:40.453
Smile, Frank.
[laughs]

31:40.455 --> 31:42.422
- [chuckles]
- [Bob] Oh, yeah.

31:42.424 --> 31:43.956
- Do I sound defensive?
- [door closes]

31:43.958 --> 31:45.658
- No.
- Is Betty coming down?

31:45.660 --> 31:47.359
I was telling Frank
on the phone,

31:47.361 --> 31:48.962
she's laid up with diarrhea.

31:48.964 --> 31:51.830
She accidentally made a sandwich
out of cat food.

31:51.832 --> 31:53.899
Well, don't worry about us.
We had dinner already.

31:53.901 --> 31:54.967
I think I'm gonna go see

31:54.969 --> 31:56.770
- how she's...
- Hey, hey, hey. You...

31:56.772 --> 31:58.605
You don't wanna go up there
right now.

31:58.607 --> 32:01.340
She's on the throne,
blowing brown,

32:01.342 --> 32:02.442
if you catch my drift.

32:02.444 --> 32:03.510
I caught it, yeah.

32:03.512 --> 32:04.578
Hey, but like I said,

32:04.580 --> 32:06.512
you two are welcome to bunk
in the twins' room.

32:06.514 --> 32:09.648
[Tristan] <i>Our room?
Why not your room?</i>

32:09.650 --> 32:11.518
Because you two can sleep
on the couch tonight.

32:11.520 --> 32:12.552
Over.

32:12.554 --> 32:15.688
[Tray] <i>Ever hear
of a Motel 6? Over.</i>

32:15.690 --> 32:17.192
Ah. Hilarious.

32:18.224 --> 32:18.857
[Bob] I'm just gonna show you
to the room,

32:18.859 --> 32:20.760
hopefully, we won't get lost.

32:20.762 --> 32:22.398
[whispers]
Let's do this every month.

32:28.803 --> 32:30.403
Sorry, fellas.

32:30.405 --> 32:31.805
Sorry enough to go away?

32:31.807 --> 32:33.740
- Wow.
- [Tristan] The bed is small.

32:33.742 --> 32:35.375
If you're gonna do
any stuff in it,

32:35.377 --> 32:37.480
just wash the sheets after.

32:38.746 --> 32:39.812
Will do.

32:39.814 --> 32:42.581
It's gross.

32:42.583 --> 32:44.684
Are we talking about
the same thing?

32:44.686 --> 32:46.418
- I'm serious.
- I'm sure you are.

32:46.420 --> 32:47.921
- Do we have a problem?
- [Frank] I don't think so.

32:47.923 --> 32:49.755
Are we done now?

32:49.757 --> 32:51.790
Yeah, I think we're done.

32:51.792 --> 32:54.828
Did you know that you can hack
into baby monitors?

32:54.830 --> 32:56.596
We're teaching
our neighbor's baby

32:56.598 --> 32:57.931
how to say the N-word.

32:57.933 --> 32:59.165
[gasps]

32:59.167 --> 33:00.834
Uh, Nancy, would you join me
outside for a cigarette please?

33:00.836 --> 33:01.969
Please. Yeah.

33:01.971 --> 33:04.471
[Nancy] You understand now
what I was talking about?

33:04.473 --> 33:06.572
Except Oompa Loompas
are not on speed,

33:06.574 --> 33:09.041
- they are on angel dust.
- [lighter clicks]

33:09.043 --> 33:10.976
How did we get so lucky
with Rachel?

33:10.978 --> 33:12.979
Well, we communicated
with her directly,

33:12.981 --> 33:14.713
not through some CB Radio.

33:14.715 --> 33:16.619
Let's start there
and reverse engineer it.

33:19.053 --> 33:20.787
I was thinking,

33:20.789 --> 33:22.021
we rented Nigel's house to Carl

33:22.023 --> 33:23.656
but we had to move him over
to our house,

33:23.658 --> 33:26.292
which means that Nigel's house
is still empty.

33:26.294 --> 33:27.793
I say we rent
Nigel's house again...

33:27.795 --> 33:28.662
- Frank!
- ...only this time

33:28.664 --> 33:30.696
to somebody who isn't
a sex offender.

33:30.698 --> 33:34.000
Or, why don't we just
handcuff ourselves

33:34.002 --> 33:37.337
and walk straight
into the police station, Frank?

33:37.339 --> 33:39.071
This place is filled
with spider webs.

33:39.073 --> 33:40.706
Well, as you can see,
they don't clean.

33:40.708 --> 33:43.409
The original Craigslist ad
is still on my phone.

33:43.411 --> 33:45.044
I say we post it again.

33:45.046 --> 33:47.646
[Nancy] Are you not listening
to me, Frank?

33:47.648 --> 33:50.916
Absolutely no fucking way.

33:50.918 --> 33:52.685
This is where we draw the line.

33:52.687 --> 33:54.687
Baby, I don't know what's
on the other side of that line,

33:54.689 --> 33:56.423
but I do know what's
on this side of that line,

33:56.425 --> 33:57.890
and it is bleak.

33:57.892 --> 33:59.392
Okay, here's the original
Craigslist ad.

33:59.394 --> 34:00.559
- [Nancy] Don't you dare.
- We delete some

34:00.561 --> 34:02.695
of the bad words, I think
you were drunk at the time.

34:02.697 --> 34:04.697
I was drunk at the time?

34:04.699 --> 34:07.733
And it is done.

34:07.735 --> 34:09.335
You just posted it again?

34:09.337 --> 34:11.871
[Nancy yells]
Frank, you just smoked a spider!

34:11.873 --> 34:14.043
[retches]

34:15.777 --> 34:16.909
Give me the Heimlich!

34:16.911 --> 34:18.913
- [retches]
- [Nancy yelling]

34:20.549 --> 34:22.782
- [baby crying]
- [man shouts indistinctly]

34:22.784 --> 34:23.949
[man 1] What the hell
is going on?

34:23.951 --> 34:25.617
You woke up my baby!

34:25.619 --> 34:27.887
[Bob] Frank, I get it,
you smoked a spider.

34:27.889 --> 34:29.889
But can you keep it down?

34:29.891 --> 34:30.956
[Frank gags]

34:30.958 --> 34:32.293
Hit me in the back.

34:33.561 --> 34:34.964
[yelps]
Not with the...

34:36.931 --> 34:40.532
[man 1] Natalie, tell your kids
to stay off my baby monitor.

34:40.534 --> 34:42.701
[Bob] It's your fault
for having a baby monitor.

34:42.703 --> 34:44.036
It's an attractive nuisance.

34:44.038 --> 34:45.505
[Nancy] Oh! There it is.

34:45.507 --> 34:47.139
[shovel banging]

34:47.141 --> 34:48.808
[Nancy pants]

34:48.810 --> 34:51.076
Oh, Frank, are you okay?

34:51.078 --> 34:52.645
Do you want another cigarette?

34:52.647 --> 34:54.146
[Frank groans]

34:54.148 --> 34:55.884
- [Nancy] <i>Are you all right baby?</i>
- [Frank groans]

35:01.056 --> 35:04.060
[foreboding music]

35:16.638 --> 35:18.940
[imitates sobbing]

35:20.442 --> 35:21.907
Dad, come quick.

35:21.909 --> 35:23.946
Why is Uncle Frank
doing this to me?

35:26.647 --> 35:28.648
What the hell? Oh, my god!

35:28.650 --> 35:30.386
- Yes?
- Frank!

35:31.018 --> 35:33.018
- [sobs]
- My god!

35:33.020 --> 35:35.054
What is going on?

35:35.056 --> 35:37.623
Nancy, are... are you naked?

35:37.625 --> 35:39.893
No, I'm not naked. It's a shirt.

35:39.895 --> 35:41.795
[Betty] Tristan, what are those?

35:41.797 --> 35:44.831
It's Aunt Nancy's Spanx,
Uncle Frank made me wear them.

35:44.833 --> 35:45.898
Now stop this.

35:45.900 --> 35:47.000
- Frank, how could you?
- What?

35:47.002 --> 35:48.134
He's just a boy.

35:48.136 --> 35:49.636
I'm so scared right now.

35:49.638 --> 35:51.036
Oh, shit.

35:51.038 --> 35:52.605
Jesus Christ.

35:52.607 --> 35:53.873
Betty.

35:53.875 --> 35:56.041
[Tristan] She just stuck
her tongue out at me.

35:56.043 --> 35:59.114
- [Tristan sobbing]
- Frank, downstairs, now.

36:03.884 --> 36:05.087
Who are you?

36:10.125 --> 36:11.224
[Nancy] <i>You know what, Frank?</i>

36:11.226 --> 36:14.793
It's not pleasant to be mistaken
for a sex offender,

36:14.795 --> 36:19.199
and molesting your nephew
in less than 24 hours.

36:19.201 --> 36:21.099
But right now,

36:21.101 --> 36:22.902
I feel sorry for my sister.

36:22.904 --> 36:25.804
I am actually
really worried for her.

36:25.806 --> 36:27.507
As you should be.

36:27.509 --> 36:30.009
Pretty soon,
some court-appointed therapist

36:30.011 --> 36:31.746
is gonna be white knuckling
with those two kids.

36:33.147 --> 36:34.681
I see that your sister
calmed down enough

36:34.683 --> 36:35.815
to lend you her wig, huh?

36:35.817 --> 36:39.117
Oh, yeah, I don't know
whose wig it is in that house.

36:39.119 --> 36:41.022
[Frank] Well, it helps us hide
from the kidnappers.

36:42.623 --> 36:44.157
[Frank] Hey, are you Wayne,
the guy that answered the ad?

36:44.159 --> 36:45.224
Yeah, yeah.

36:45.226 --> 36:46.726
- I'm Frank.
- Yeah. What are you two,

36:46.728 --> 36:47.893
in the witness
protection program?

36:47.895 --> 36:49.862
Uh, no, we were just sunning
ourselves in the backyard.

36:49.864 --> 36:51.130
- Is that your truck, Wayne?
- [Wayne] Yeah.

36:51.132 --> 36:52.165
[Frank] Oh, that's fantastic.
Step inside

36:52.167 --> 36:54.002
and we'll just take a look
at the house, okay?

36:58.072 --> 37:00.273
The ad said, uh,
the house comes furnished.

37:00.275 --> 37:03.041
Uh, yup. It only needs
a mattress. Long story.

37:03.043 --> 37:04.576
The previous tenant took it.

37:04.578 --> 37:05.645
Short story.

37:05.647 --> 37:08.681
Okay, then. I wrote you a check.

37:08.683 --> 37:10.817
You, uh, that's it? You don't
wanna have a look around?

37:10.819 --> 37:13.085
Listen, not to be an asshole.
You wanna rent the place or not?

37:13.087 --> 37:15.054
I mean, I got shit tons
of stuff to do.

37:15.056 --> 37:17.757
Yes, uh, no, uh, sure.

37:17.759 --> 37:19.291
It's just that normally
there's a process.

37:19.293 --> 37:21.293
We learned the hard way
to ask questions.

37:21.295 --> 37:22.561
[crackling noise]

37:22.563 --> 37:24.697
Did you hear that?

37:24.699 --> 37:26.101

We can always, uh, cash that.

through concrete."

47:05.313 --> 47:06.378
this is what I got.

47:06.380 --> 47:09.681
- [Nancy grunting]
- I'm really glad you're here.

47:09.683 --> 47:10.815
<i>Me gusta.</i>

47:10.817 --> 47:12.717
- [shrieks]
- [groans]

47:12.719 --> 47:15.654
[groans]
Oh, jeez. That was...

47:15.656 --> 47:17.489
[grunts]

47:17.491 --> 47:18.425
That was...

47:18.427 --> 47:21.494
If you ever try
anything like that again,

47:21.496 --> 47:23.228
I am gonna kick your ass

47:23.230 --> 47:26.467
up and down this panic room
like an air hockey puck!

47:27.435 --> 47:28.666
- Oh, okay.
- [sighs]

47:28.668 --> 47:29.768
[groans]

47:29.770 --> 47:32.170
[laughs]

47:32.172 --> 47:34.340
Thank you,
<i>Virgincita de Guadalupe</i>

47:34.342 --> 47:37.813
for making Carl
such a breathtaking moron.

47:39.714 --> 47:42.417
You forgot about
the attic hatch,

47:42.917 --> 47:45.217
Einstein.

47:45.219 --> 47:47.556
Uh. Hey, I...
I'm sorry about the...

47:48.422 --> 47:49.587
misunderstanding.

47:49.589 --> 47:52.190
I guess I misread your signals.

47:52.192 --> 47:53.458
What signals?

47:53.460 --> 47:56.395
God, your legs are so strong.

47:56.397 --> 47:58.329
I guess it's
from running track, huh?

47:58.331 --> 47:59.632
I saw your medals.

47:59.634 --> 48:01.300
How did you find my medals?

48:01.302 --> 48:02.800
They were hidden in the garage.

48:02.802 --> 48:04.402
[Carl] Yeah, way back there.

48:04.404 --> 48:06.237
And you should really
hide them better.

48:06.239 --> 48:07.873
But you were the fastest
on the team,

48:07.875 --> 48:09.641
but what I don't understand is,

48:09.643 --> 48:11.809
in the relay,
why did you run fourth?

48:11.811 --> 48:13.945
Shouldn't the fastest runner
go first?

48:13.947 --> 48:15.614
Maybe you weren't the fastest.

48:15.616 --> 48:17.683
I was the fastest.

48:17.685 --> 48:19.317
That's not the way it works.

48:19.319 --> 48:21.587
When you're the fastest, you...

48:21.589 --> 48:23.889
Oh, what am I doing,
why am I talking to you?

48:23.891 --> 48:26.491
Please help me out.

48:26.493 --> 48:28.494
Uh, the bottom line is,
I'm interested.

48:28.496 --> 48:30.695
And, uh, I... I work hard,

48:30.697 --> 48:33.734
and I take any job I do,
uh, very seriously.

48:34.435 --> 48:36.235
Okay.

48:36.237 --> 48:38.404
Here comes the cold water.
[inhales deeply]

48:38.406 --> 48:39.804
We can only offer you

48:39.806 --> 48:41.607
about a third
of what you were making.

48:41.609 --> 48:43.541
Tyler told me
your ballpark salary.

48:43.543 --> 48:45.677
You did very, very well.

48:45.679 --> 48:46.714
A third?

48:47.681 --> 48:49.315
Listen, I wish it was different.

48:49.317 --> 48:50.715
I used to make
high-end five figures

48:50.717 --> 48:52.951
over at Brent Talbot,
then the fan hit the shit.

48:52.953 --> 48:56.355
Now, I got a sales staff
of guys longing for the days

48:56.357 --> 48:57.456
of Hugo Boss suits

48:57.458 --> 48:59.991
and paychecks
with commas in them.

48:59.993 --> 49:02.228
Frank, you think I like crawling
around in the dirt

49:02.230 --> 49:03.561
snipping smoke sacks?

49:03.563 --> 49:04.697
[scoffs]
Shit.

49:04.699 --> 49:07.465
Some days I look at one of those
cat cons and think...

49:07.467 --> 49:09.634
I'll just wrap my lips
around it,

49:09.636 --> 49:12.273
take a deep breath,
go meet some dead relatives.

49:12.839 --> 49:14.005
How old are you?

49:14.007 --> 49:16.275
- Sixty-five?
- [laughs]

49:16.277 --> 49:17.610
Sixty-six?

49:17.612 --> 49:18.811
Anyways.

49:18.813 --> 49:22.348
Guys your age,
you gotta adapt or die.

49:22.350 --> 49:24.483
That's the new America.
Trust me.

49:24.485 --> 49:25.720
I miss the old one, brother.

49:27.587 --> 49:29.420
[clicks tongue]
Uh, will you excuse me?

49:29.422 --> 49:31.357
I... I'm...

49:31.359 --> 49:33.360
fairly positive
I need to use the bathroom.

49:34.694 --> 49:36.395
[Nancy] Get your hands
off my ass.

49:36.397 --> 49:37.529
You said push.

49:37.531 --> 49:39.398
[Nancy] I said push, not fondle.

49:39.400 --> 49:40.532
Watch the thumb.

49:40.534 --> 49:42.768
[stutters]
Do you do squats?

49:42.770 --> 49:44.406
It feels like you do squats.

49:45.639 --> 49:46.771
[Carl groans]

49:46.773 --> 49:48.273
- [Nancy grunts]
- [Carl] You made it.

49:48.275 --> 49:49.708
Now, lift me up.

49:49.710 --> 49:51.809
[grunts]
I get claustrophobic.

49:51.811 --> 49:54.045
No, no.

49:54.047 --> 49:56.315
First you have to tell me
what you did.

49:56.317 --> 49:58.483
And no lies, no bullshit.

49:58.485 --> 50:00.819
You have to tell me,
or I'll leave you there.

50:00.821 --> 50:01.753
You'll rot.

50:01.755 --> 50:04.523
And I'll just come
and sprinkle some lime

50:04.525 --> 50:05.860
just to mask the smell.

50:06.694 --> 50:07.696
I...
[sighs]

50:08.362 --> 50:09.364
You...

50:10.063 --> 50:11.699
you might not understand.

50:12.799 --> 50:14.565
True.

50:14.567 --> 50:15.903
It's a roll of the dice.

50:19.706 --> 50:21.009
[sighs]

50:22.476 --> 50:24.543
I was swimming in the ocean,

50:24.545 --> 50:26.445
I was in the water
for a couple hours.

50:26.447 --> 50:28.646
I...

50:28.648 --> 50:32.617
I had to pee,
I took off my shorts,

50:32.619 --> 50:35.020
then I felt something
brush against my leg.

50:35.022 --> 50:38.424
I knew it was a shark.
I knew in that moment,

50:38.426 --> 50:40.761
and I know it to this day
it was a shark, and...

50:41.761 --> 50:43.561
[sighs]

50:43.563 --> 50:45.697
I started swimming to shore,

50:45.699 --> 50:47.733
trying not to panic.

50:47.735 --> 50:50.034
I saw that there were some kids

50:50.036 --> 50:51.936
swimming there and...

50:51.938 --> 50:54.440
So I was carrying three of them,

50:54.442 --> 50:58.110
trudging and tripping
and yelling for help.

50:58.112 --> 50:59.378
The kids were screaming,

50:59.380 --> 51:01.846
I thought they had seen
the shark.

51:01.848 --> 51:03.584
They hadn't, they, um...

51:05.118 --> 51:08.455
they were frightened of me,
a naked guy.

51:09.757 --> 51:10.959
Yeah. My life...

51:11.592 --> 51:13.025
[laughs]

51:13.027 --> 51:15.063
[sighs]
...got pretty hard after that.

51:17.732 --> 51:18.933
It's true, isn't it?

51:21.502 --> 51:22.570
Yeah.

51:23.971 --> 51:25.670
It is.

51:25.672 --> 51:27.408
You say all these

51:28.007 --> 51:31.509
crazy stupid things.

51:31.511 --> 51:34.615
But when you suddenly say
something without bullshit,

51:35.850 --> 51:38.416
now I know it's true and good.

51:38.418 --> 51:40.953
But just in case,
I'm gonna leave you there

51:40.955 --> 51:42.621
until after I take my shower.

51:42.623 --> 51:45.023
Oh, you know what,
there's some, uh...

51:45.025 --> 51:47.692
shampoo in my purse
on the kitchen counter.

51:47.694 --> 51:50.462
Oh, I... I refilled
your birth control pills.

51:50.464 --> 51:51.864
You were running low.

51:51.866 --> 51:52.867
Ha!

51:54.601 --> 51:55.837
[truck horn blows]

51:57.003 --> 51:59.438
No, no, no.

51:59.440 --> 52:00.508
No! No! No!

52:01.609 --> 52:04.612
[upbeat music]

52:20.795 --> 52:21.963
[muffled screams]

52:24.665 --> 52:26.764
[man 1] <i>All you perverts
out there watching,</i>

52:26.766 --> 52:28.900
<i>this might happen to you.</i>

52:28.902 --> 52:30.802
[gunshots]

52:30.804 --> 52:32.603
<i>You might die!</i>

52:32.605 --> 52:33.572
What the?

52:33.574 --> 52:35.940
Holy shit, it's him.
The guy from the video!

52:35.942 --> 52:37.675
- No, this is a mistake.
- [gunshot]

52:37.677 --> 52:38.677
[man 2] <i>Die!</i>

52:38.679 --> 52:40.645
Dude, you're like the number one
trending pervert

52:40.647 --> 52:41.813
on the internet right now.

52:41.815 --> 52:44.650
My god, why is this happening?

52:44.652 --> 52:47.688
[upbeat music]

52:52.058 --> 52:53.694
- [tires screech]
- [horn honks]

52:57.498 --> 52:58.733
- [Frank] Stop!
- [banging on truck]

52:59.732 --> 53:00.799
Stop the truck, Wayne.

53:00.801 --> 53:02.099
Shit, you again?

53:02.101 --> 53:03.067
You have my furniture.

53:03.069 --> 53:05.704
Oh, it's not yours,
that house wasn't yours,

53:05.706 --> 53:07.639
and the furniture
definitely wasn't yours.

53:07.641 --> 53:09.141
Pull over, Wayne,
I need that furniture.

53:09.143 --> 53:10.175
You know what you gonna need?

53:10.177 --> 53:12.076
You're have a need
to go to a fucking hospital,

53:12.078 --> 53:13.478
that's what you're gonna need.

53:13.480 --> 53:14.846
I'm gonna put you
in jail, Wayne.

53:14.848 --> 53:17.248
Oh, you don't have the balls
to call the cops.

53:17.250 --> 53:19.851
Fuckin', you suck
at this crime stuff.

53:19.853 --> 53:20.985
You know what I'm gonna do,

53:20.987 --> 53:22.855
- Wayne?
- Oh, you ain't gonna do shit.

53:22.857 --> 53:24.956
I'm gonna throw a rock at you.
I pitched in college.

53:24.958 --> 53:28.462
Oh, you probably caught
in college. Dickhead.

53:30.531 --> 53:31.596
Oh, shit.

53:31.598 --> 53:33.834
Argh! Son of a bitch.

53:35.168 --> 53:36.235
[honking]

[Wayne grunts]

53:37.505 --> 53:38.570
[groans]

53:38.572 --> 53:39.871
- [Wayne] Shit!
- [driver] Holy shit,

53:39.873 --> 53:40.973
- are you okay?
- What the fuck?

53:40.975 --> 53:43.041
- You hit a fucking pedestrian!
- [bike bell chimes]

53:43.043 --> 53:44.579
- [thuds]
- [both grunt]

53:45.813 --> 53:48.212
[Wayne] What the fuck?

53:48.214 --> 53:49.516
Sorry, Wayne.

53:51.217 --> 53:52.650
[Wayne] Hey!

53:52.652 --> 53:53.819
Frank!

53:53.821 --> 53:56.123
Get back here, you asshole!

53:56.924 --> 53:58.226
[clacking]

54:03.697 --> 54:05.032
[winch whirring]

54:06.799 --> 54:10.034
- What fresh hell is this?
- [car honking]

54:10.036 --> 54:12.103
[Nancy] <i>Ay Dios mio!</i>
No, no, no, I didn't...

54:12.105 --> 54:13.107

[foreboding music]

54:29.556 --> 54:31.658
[Frank] Shit, shit. Now what?

54:41.735 --> 54:43.271
[crows cawing]

54:45.306 --> 54:46.837
- [Nancy] Frank!
- [Frank] Shit!

54:46.839 --> 54:48.172
[Nancy] Panic room, car gone.

54:48.174 --> 54:49.574
Keep walking, cops.

54:49.576 --> 54:50.842
I found Nigel's stuff,
don't look over.

54:50.844 --> 54:52.277
It's in the back of the truck.
Don't look over.

54:52.279 --> 54:53.681
[police 1] Excuse me.

54:54.647 --> 54:55.746
Hi.

54:55.748 --> 54:57.185
Are you
Mr. Bathgate's neighbors?

54:58.018 --> 54:59.116
[Frank] Yes, officer.

54:59.118 --> 55:01.686
Yeah, we got a report
of a burglary at his house,

55:01.688 --> 55:03.121
uh, suspicious activity.

55:03.123 --> 55:04.723
Have you seen anything?

55:04.725 --> 55:06.960
A burglary?
What, at Nigel's house?

55:08.194 --> 55:09.761
Good sweet Christ,

55:09.763 --> 55:12.630
what is happening to our sweet
little neighborhood?

55:12.632 --> 55:15.933
- Uh, are you okay sir?
- [Frank] No.

55:15.935 --> 55:19.606
I'm devastated beyond reason.

55:24.712 --> 55:25.880
Sweet Christ.

55:27.147 --> 55:28.882
[Frank] No, I wasn't into that.

55:29.717 --> 55:31.083
[Nancy] Never?

55:31.085 --> 55:32.884
[Frank] Not really.

55:32.886 --> 55:34.820
Not even in a school play
or anything?

55:34.822 --> 55:36.320
No, I was never into drama.

55:36.322 --> 55:39.090
I mean, sure, in the third grade
I played a teacup.

55:39.092 --> 55:40.826
Uh, why...
[chuckles]

55:40.828 --> 55:42.728
...all the questions
about acting?

55:42.730 --> 55:43.962
You think I came across as fake?

55:43.964 --> 55:46.364
I think there's better acting
every time Larry King says,

55:46.366 --> 55:47.965
"Till death do us part."

55:47.967 --> 55:49.300
[Frank] Well, that's very funny.

55:49.302 --> 55:50.436
You wanna hear something else
that's funny?

55:50.438 --> 55:53.304
There's a video of us
getting kidnapped on YouTube.

55:53.306 --> 55:54.341
[Nancy] I know.

56:01.781 --> 56:03.882
You don't know how many times
I've fantasized

56:03.884 --> 56:06.253
about getting rid of you
for at least two months,

56:07.253 --> 56:09.320
<i>but now that I'm going toyail,</i>

56:09.322 --> 56:12.757
I... I'm gonna be devastated
without you.

56:12.759 --> 56:15.059
Wait, you're going back
to college?

56:15.061 --> 56:17.998
<i>You know that when I say "yail"</i>
I mean prison.

56:22.835 --> 56:24.168
[truck door closes]

56:24.170 --> 56:26.204
[Frank] He lives
in his mother's house.

56:26.206 --> 56:28.373
And by that I mean
his mother's garage.

56:28.375 --> 56:30.241
I'm sure Jason's home, you know,

56:30.243 --> 56:32.444
rubbing his mother's feet
or something.

56:32.446 --> 56:34.212
We know you're in there, Jason.

56:34.214 --> 56:36.049
[rattling]

56:39.719 --> 56:41.319
- [Nancy] Hi.
- [Jason] Oh!

56:41.321 --> 56:43.255
Hey, hi, Mr. and Mrs. Teagarten.

56:43.257 --> 56:44.889
Is that I...

56:44.891 --> 56:46.757
Actually, I wasn't hiding.
Is, is everything okay?

56:46.759 --> 56:47.992
Why wouldn't it be, Jason?

56:47.994 --> 56:49.061
Well, it's just that you've
never been to my house before

56:49.063 --> 56:52.264
in like two years.
And it's what, um, 10:00 p.m.

56:52.266 --> 56:55.300
Actually, it isn't okay,
and you can help.

56:55.302 --> 56:56.867
Rachel's always saying that
you're some kind of

56:56.869 --> 56:57.969
computer genius.

56:57.971 --> 56:59.837
Aw. She says
I'm a computer genius?

56:59.839 --> 57:01.139
That's very...
that's very sweet.

57:01.141 --> 57:02.340
I'm sure it was like
a throwaway,

57:02.342 --> 57:03.541
or like an aside, you know,

57:03.543 --> 57:04.576
"He's a computer genius,"
you know, just like saying...

57:04.578 --> 57:05.677
Oh, you know what,
I bet it's 'cause she knows

57:05.679 --> 57:08.380
it's on my dream boards
to become a computer genius.

57:08.382 --> 57:09.447
I'll bet that's where
that came from.

57:09.449 --> 57:11.248
Did she actually say that,
or like in an e-mail,

57:11.250 --> 57:12.750
or was it to...
in person to you just...

57:12.752 --> 57:14.485
Jason! This isn't about you.

57:14.487 --> 57:17.391
We need your help
with a video of me and Nancy.

57:19.426 --> 57:20.491
Okay.

57:20.493 --> 57:22.293
So you want...

57:22.295 --> 57:25.996
me to make a video of you guys?

57:25.998 --> 57:27.199
- Oh, get your mind
- No.

57:27.201 --> 57:28.067
out of the gutter.

57:28.069 --> 57:30.103
Good lord, Jason,
you take the cake.

57:32.873 --> 57:35.172
It's so much more
fucked up than that.

57:35.174 --> 57:37.208
[gunshots]

57:37.210 --> 57:38.976
- Look at this.
- [man 1] <i>You might die!</i>

57:38.978 --> 57:41.246
This is insane.
When did this happen?

57:41.248 --> 57:43.782
It feels like
in another lifetime.

57:43.784 --> 57:45.282
Yet also like Tuesday.

57:45.284 --> 57:46.851
Okay, well,
we have to call the police.

57:46.853 --> 57:47.987
No! No police.

57:47.989 --> 57:50.020
It was a misunderstanding
but everything's okay now.

57:50.022 --> 57:52.023
It was a hiccup.

57:52.025 --> 57:53.991
A hiccup? You being kidnapped?

57:53.993 --> 57:55.826
A hiccup. It was a hiccup.

57:55.828 --> 57:57.161
A hiccup. You don't call 911

57:57.163 --> 57:58.496
every time you have
the hiccups do you, no.

57:58.498 --> 57:59.864
I mean, maybe you do,
but I don't.

57:59.866 --> 58:02.067
Listen, Jason.

58:02.069 --> 58:03.501
We don't want Rachel
to see this.

58:03.503 --> 58:05.369
- [Jason] Mm-hm.
- She would only worry.

58:05.371 --> 58:08.306
That's why we must
take this down.

58:08.308 --> 58:10.141
[Jason] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Shouldn't be a problem.

58:10.143 --> 58:11.909
Although, these guys
should be punished though,

58:11.911 --> 58:14.311
'cause they cannot do that.
We'd... Especially to you guys.

58:14.313 --> 58:15.348
- I mean...
- [computer chimes]

58:16.449 --> 58:17.549
Oh, my god, okay,
that's actually

58:17.551 --> 58:18.650
Rachel Skyping me now.

58:18.652 --> 58:20.918
We're not here. She'll know
there's something wrong.

58:20.920 --> 58:22.920
We, we would only be here
with you if we were desperate.

58:22.922 --> 58:25.056
No, no, I wanna see
her little face,

58:25.058 --> 58:26.925
even if it's for just a second.

58:26.927 --> 58:28.527
We can hide,
she won't know we're here,

58:28.529 --> 58:29.527
please, please, please.

58:29.529 --> 58:31.798
- All right, go ahead.
- [Jason] Really? Okay.

58:33.167 --> 58:34.266
- [button clicks]
- [computer chimes]

58:34.268 --> 58:36.201
Yo! Hey, Rach. What's up?

58:36.203 --> 58:38.203
<i>I can only talk
for a few minutes.</i>

58:38.205 --> 58:40.204
<i>Jessie is a great roommate,</i>

58:40.206 --> 58:41.973
<i>but she's throwing
her third party</i>

58:41.975 --> 58:43.377
<i>in four days, and she's...</i>

58:44.578 --> 58:46.311
<i>Jason?</i>

58:46.313 --> 58:47.411
<i>Are you okay?</i>

58:47.413 --> 58:49.380
What? I'm fine. That's...

58:49.382 --> 58:51.349
How about you?

58:51.351 --> 58:52.416
[sighs]
<i>Well, actually,</i>

58:52.418 --> 58:53.617
<i>I'm a little worried.</i>

58:53.619 --> 58:56.054
<i>My mom called,
and I tried calling her back,</i>

58:56.056 --> 58:57.922
<i>and she's not picking up.</i>

58:57.924 --> 58:59.958
Oh, uh, that's, you know.

58:59.960 --> 59:01.458
It's... It's her...
'Cause her phone,

59:01.460 --> 59:03.061
it's, um, her phone is broken.

59:03.063 --> 59:04.061
[Rachel] <i>You saw her?</i>

59:04.063 --> 59:06.063
Yeah. Oh, they had
a yard sale yesterday, so.

59:06.065 --> 59:07.933
- [Rachel] <i>A yard sale?</i>
- <i>No, that's..</i>

59:07.935 --> 59:09.201
I'm sorry,
"yard sale," what is...

59:09.203 --> 59:11.001
No, they were...
'cause they were in the yard,

59:11.003 --> 59:13.270
so I ran into them
cause I took a shortcut,

59:13.272 --> 59:16.208
um, to... to...
to go work at Staples,

59:16.210 --> 59:18.009
where I am
the assistant manager.

59:18.011 --> 59:19.210
[Rachel] <i>This is weird.</i>

59:19.212 --> 59:22.179
<i>Mom always calls me right back.
This isn't like her.</i>

59:22.181 --> 59:23.248
Well, it's...

59:23.250 --> 59:25.951
Could be 'cause she's...
she's singing and dancing,

59:25.953 --> 59:28.085
and, and also blowing someone.

59:28.087 --> 59:29.186
[stammers]
Uh, her birthday.

59:29.188 --> 59:30.454
Isn't it her birthday
pretty soon?

59:30.456 --> 59:32.960
<i>Oh, of course, poor Mom.</i>

59:34.261 --> 59:35.960
<i>Jason,</i>

59:35.962 --> 59:38.230
<i>I should surprise her.</i>

59:38.232 --> 59:40.197
<i>I'll come home for her birthday,
she'll love that.</i>

59:40.199 --> 59:42.500
Yeah, yeah, they both would.
Yeah, they would both love that.

59:42.502 --> 59:44.034
For sure.
You should come on down.

59:44.036 --> 59:45.170
<i>I'll try Dad, he'll love it.</i>

59:45.172 --> 59:47.938
<i>I'll get tulips.
Tulips are her favorite flowers,</i>

59:47.940 --> 59:50.507
<i>and I'll invite all her sisters,
and everyone will be there</i>

59:50.509 --> 59:51.912
- <i>and everyone will be...</i>
- [cell phone ringing]

59:56.148 --> 59:57.884
<i>That's funny, do you hear that?</i>

59:59.418 --> 01:00:00.985
<i>It's my dad's ringtone.</i>

01:00:00.987 --> 01:00:03.290
[cell phone ringing]

01:00:04.491 --> 01:00:06.056
Yeah, okay,
you know what, Rachel?

01:00:06.058 --> 01:00:07.525
I really...
I gotta tell you something.

01:00:07.527 --> 01:00:09.126
- Actually, your parent...
- [thuds]

01:00:09.128 --> 01:00:10.895
[electricity powers down]

01:00:10.897 --> 01:00:13.665
[Frank] Jason, you really are
a little quisling.

01:00:13.667 --> 01:00:14.933
You know that?

01:00:14.935 --> 01:00:16.000
[Jason] Okay, he...

01:00:16.002 --> 01:00:17.569
- he was from Norway.
- [Nancy sighs]

01:00:17.571 --> 01:00:19.536
I felt terrible lying to Rachel.

01:00:19.538 --> 01:00:20.672
I understand,

01:00:20.674 --> 01:00:23.174
because you never know
when the lies are going to stop.

01:00:23.176 --> 01:00:24.476
But they just keep coming.

01:00:24.478 --> 01:00:26.411
Pushing you out of the way.

01:00:26.413 --> 01:00:28.516
Taking over your life
completely.

01:00:29.549 --> 01:00:32.217
[sighs]
What a beautiful street.

01:00:32.219 --> 01:00:33.550
Do you have raccoons?

01:00:33.552 --> 01:00:35.520
Yeah, sporadically.
[chuckles]

01:00:35.522 --> 01:00:36.587
I love them.

01:00:36.589 --> 01:00:37.922
Is that your guy's moving truck?

01:00:37.924 --> 01:00:39.491
No. Well, yes.

01:00:39.493 --> 01:00:41.393
We're just trying
to sell a few things.

01:00:41.395 --> 01:00:42.494
Sell from the back of a truck?
[chuckles]

01:00:42.496 --> 01:00:45.063
Uh, we're trying to,
uh, finish off our yard sale.

01:00:45.065 --> 01:00:45.963
For the truck and the computer,

01:00:45.965 --> 01:00:48.233
using that, uh, Skype thing.
Anyhow...

01:00:48.235 --> 01:00:49.567
So, you mean
like a virtual yard sale?

01:00:49.569 --> 01:00:50.567
That's... Wow.

01:00:50.569 --> 01:00:52.670
Did you come up with that idea,
Mr. Teagarten?

01:00:52.672 --> 01:00:55.040
What? Uh, yeah, sure.
Anyway, thanks for your help...

01:00:55.042 --> 01:00:56.541
That's genius!
Do you see the potential?

01:00:56.543 --> 01:00:58.409
Not one iota. We gotta run now.

01:00:58.411 --> 01:01:00.445
Uh, wait, Mr.
and Mrs. Teagarten, there's...

01:01:00.447 --> 01:01:01.947
I think there's something
I need to show you.

01:01:01.949 --> 01:01:03.918
For the love of Christ, Jason!
What is it?

01:01:04.650 --> 01:01:09.219
[somber music]

01:01:09.221 --> 01:01:11.956
[Jason] <i>So the park
was actually built in the '50s.</i>

01:01:11.958 --> 01:01:13.657
It's, uh, kind of fell
on hard times,

01:01:13.659 --> 01:01:15.592
was vacant for a while.

01:01:15.594 --> 01:01:17.329
So some friends and I,
we pooled our money

01:01:17.331 --> 01:01:18.396
and bought it,

01:01:18.398 --> 01:01:21.166
and we spent the last two years
just fixing it up.

01:01:21.168 --> 01:01:23.233
[Nancy] Jason, this is amazing.

01:01:23.235 --> 01:01:24.436
[Jason] Thank you.

01:01:24.438 --> 01:01:27.172
[clacking]

01:01:27.174 --> 01:01:28.172
This is what I wanted
to show you.

01:01:28.174 --> 01:01:30.976
All of our trailer homes
have a storage space,

01:01:30.978 --> 01:01:33.744
'cause people are downsizing
from like, 3,500 square feet.

01:01:33.746 --> 01:01:36.648
These days, I guess
it's like that everywhere.

01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:39.416
So this is where
your virtual yard sale comes in.

01:01:39.418 --> 01:01:41.186
You can upload streaming video

01:01:41.188 --> 01:01:44.355
and people can browse it,
like in real time.

01:01:44.357 --> 01:01:46.623
So you've got almost
a live yard sale,

01:01:46.625 --> 01:01:49.094
but you're bidding,
like eBay online.

01:01:49.096 --> 01:01:52.230
So you call it something like,
YardBay.

01:01:52.232 --> 01:01:53.297
[chuckles]

01:01:53.299 --> 01:01:55.433
I'm sure you've thought
all this through, but, um,

01:01:55.435 --> 01:01:56.601
you know, I'd love to help, I...
[stutters]

01:01:56.603 --> 01:01:58.402
I could computer code
it all for you.

01:01:58.404 --> 01:02:01.005
[cell phone ringing]

01:02:01.007 --> 01:02:02.306
- Hello?
- [indistinct dialogue]

01:02:02.308 --> 01:02:04.442
[in Japanese accent]
No, Mr. Teagarten no here.

01:02:04.444 --> 01:02:05.710
You have to call back a later.

01:02:05.712 --> 01:02:07.078
[indistinct dialogue]

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:08.045
Oh, he in the shower now

01:02:08.047 --> 01:02:10.283
washing his body
with the shampoo and honey.

01:02:11.284 --> 01:02:12.384
He have a shingles.

01:02:12.386 --> 01:02:13.717
[indistinct dialogue]

01:02:13.719 --> 01:02:14.721
[clears throat]

01:02:16.188 --> 01:02:17.621
That was an old
fraternity buddy of mine.

01:02:17.623 --> 01:02:19.324
Clyde Drexler.
[sniffles]

01:02:19.326 --> 01:02:20.724
I mean, he's a fan
of Clyde Drexler.

01:02:20.726 --> 01:02:22.559
- Mm-hm.
- The Trailblazers.

01:02:22.561 --> 01:02:24.161
Um, anyway, uh.

01:02:24.163 --> 01:02:26.163
Thanks for the tour, Jason.
This was impressive.

01:02:26.165 --> 01:02:28.099
Mobile homes and crap.

01:02:28.101 --> 01:02:30.567
I'm sorry.
That sounded patronizing.

01:02:30.569 --> 01:02:32.270
- [Frank] Food for thought.
- Yeah.

01:02:32.272 --> 01:02:33.670
Uh, thanks for your help
with the video.

01:02:33.672 --> 01:02:34.773
Anytime.

01:02:34.775 --> 01:02:36.510
[clacking]

01:02:37.177 --> 01:02:38.179
[thuds]

01:02:39.378 --> 01:02:41.679
Boy, Jason sure can talk.
[Frank chuckles]

01:02:41.681 --> 01:02:42.813
Okay, I better call Randall

01:02:42.815 --> 01:02:45.382
and tell him I'll take
that catalytic converter job.

01:02:45.384 --> 01:02:46.583
[Nancy grunts]

01:02:46.585 --> 01:02:49.255
[Nancy] Okay, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go get a Baby Ruth.

01:02:50.424 --> 01:02:52.059
- [door opens]
- A Baby Ruth?

01:02:53.393 --> 01:02:54.595
[car approaching]

01:02:59.232 --> 01:03:00.234
Shit.

01:03:02.368 --> 01:03:03.403
[car door opens]

01:03:04.571 --> 01:03:06.503
[Frank] Excuse me.

01:03:06.505 --> 01:03:08.239
Hey, I'm sorry to bother you.

01:03:08.241 --> 01:03:10.275
I... You have any change,
or better yet,

01:03:10.277 --> 01:03:11.675
do you mind if I use
your cell phone?

01:03:11.677 --> 01:03:12.777
It's kind of an emergency.

01:03:12.779 --> 01:03:15.079
[Nancy] A Baby Ruth candy bar.

01:03:15.081 --> 01:03:16.447
[cashier] Oh, <i>Baby Ruth.</i>

01:03:16.449 --> 01:03:18.449
I thought you said Zagnut.

01:03:18.451 --> 01:03:19.851
- [Nancy] Do you have one?
- [cashier] Uh...

01:03:19.853 --> 01:03:21.386
Yeah, let me check in the back.

01:03:21.388 --> 01:03:23.123
[Nancy] I'll take two
if you have 'em.

01:03:24.790 --> 01:03:26.224
Buddy, cool off.
[stammers]

01:03:26.226 --> 01:03:28.425
I'm not trying to cause
any problems here.

01:03:28.427 --> 01:03:29.661
You act like you got

01:03:29.663 --> 01:03:31.695
50 kilos back there
or something.

01:03:31.697 --> 01:03:32.864
[Nancy] Oh, by the way,
how much are...

01:03:32.866 --> 01:03:34.498
What? What the?

01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:36.703
Frank! Frank! Frank!

01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:39.672
[door opens]

01:03:40.739 --> 01:03:42.042
[door closes]

01:03:44.511 --> 01:03:47.148
[cashier] Hey! I found
the king size, is that okay?

01:03:48.348 --> 01:03:49.413
[Nancy screams]

01:03:49.415 --> 01:03:51.715
[speaking Spanish]

01:03:51.717 --> 01:03:52.817
[cashier] Hello?

01:03:52.819 --> 01:03:54.485
The king size, okay?

01:03:54.487 --> 01:03:56.420
[Nancy yells]

01:03:56.422 --> 01:03:59.290
You try that again,
motherfucker?

01:03:59.292 --> 01:04:00.791
I'm gonna bust
your fucking head open.

01:04:00.793 --> 01:04:02.362
[siren wailing]

01:04:04.563 --> 01:04:06.331
[police 1] Everybody put
your hands where I can see 'em!

01:04:06.333 --> 01:04:07.898
- [police 2] Down in the ground!
- [police 3] On the ground!

01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:09.400
[police 1]
Get on the ground now!

01:04:09.402 --> 01:04:12.170
[overlapping dialogue]

01:04:12.172 --> 01:04:13.505
[helicopter whirring]

01:04:13.507 --> 01:04:15.405
[dogs barking]

01:04:15.407 --> 01:04:17.478
[sirens wailing]

01:04:18.545 --> 01:04:20.277
[police 1] Whoo! Jackpot.

01:04:20.279 --> 01:04:23.283
[foreboding music]

01:04:25.719 --> 01:04:27.152
[sighs]

01:04:27.154 --> 01:04:29.686
Turns out it was 120 kilos.

01:04:29.688 --> 01:04:31.524
Teagarten. Frank Teagarten.

01:04:32.792 --> 01:04:33.860
[clacks]

01:04:35.362 --> 01:04:36.860
FBI wants to talk to you.
Come on.

01:04:36.862 --> 01:04:39.596
The FBI wants to talk
to me? Why?

01:04:39.598 --> 01:04:41.699
They think you're good lookin'.
Come on.

01:04:41.701 --> 01:04:42.770
[sighs]

01:04:44.203 --> 01:04:45.205
Not you.

01:04:46.806 --> 01:04:48.175
- [thud]
- [police 4] Let's go.

01:04:49.808 --> 01:04:51.211
[keys jingle]

01:04:56.248 --> 01:04:57.384
Are you okay?

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:02.123
It seems to me
you're as scared as I am.

01:05:03.355 --> 01:05:05.125
Oh, I'm not scared for myself.

01:05:07.893 --> 01:05:09.162
For my daughter.

01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:11.732
We're done talkin'.

01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:18.605
I have a daughter, too.

01:05:20.373 --> 01:05:24.211
Our biggest fear in life
was to disappoint her.

01:05:25.878 --> 01:05:28.315
I'm so ashamed and...

01:05:28.949 --> 01:05:29.947
and worried...

01:05:29.949 --> 01:05:32.449
Don't be bitching to me
about your rich life,

01:05:32.451 --> 01:05:33.851
your spoiled brat daughter.

01:05:33.853 --> 01:05:35.719
You know, you're gonna be out
of here in a minute,

01:05:35.721 --> 01:05:37.454
and she'll have her mommy back.

01:05:37.456 --> 01:05:38.855
But now, thanks to you,

01:05:38.857 --> 01:05:41.491
I'm stuck in here
for god knows how long.

01:05:41.493 --> 01:05:43.561
Yeah. I will get out,

01:05:43.563 --> 01:05:48.866
but I will still be
a good-for-nothing fuck up.

01:05:48.868 --> 01:05:51.469
And that might not mean
a lot to you,

01:05:51.471 --> 01:05:54.672
since it looks like you've been
a fuck up for a while,

01:05:54.674 --> 01:05:57.942
but we only fucked up
for one week.

01:05:57.944 --> 01:06:00.480
One week, is all it took
for us to...

01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:02.348
ruin her life.

01:06:02.882 --> 01:06:04.648
She's only 19,

01:06:04.650 --> 01:06:06.619
- and... and now she's...
- Are you kidding me?

01:06:07.554 --> 01:06:08.552
[Shope] Your daughter's 19.

01:06:08.554 --> 01:06:10.657
She's supposed
to be taking care of herself.

01:06:11.857 --> 01:06:12.926
My Rose...

01:06:13.993 --> 01:06:15.328
she's only seven.

01:06:16.395 --> 01:06:17.397
And now...

01:06:18.697 --> 01:06:20.398
she's all alone in the world.

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:21.635
She's got nobody.

01:06:22.569 --> 01:06:23.771
[sniffles]

01:06:25.639 --> 01:06:27.438
Woman...

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:31.509
you have no idea what shame is.

01:06:31.511 --> 01:06:32.679
[Nancy] Shit.

01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:34.615
You win.

01:06:35.815 --> 01:06:37.982
[sirens wailing]

01:06:37.984 --> 01:06:39.416
[Milhouse] <i>Hey, Frank.</i>

01:06:39.418 --> 01:06:41.552
I'm Special Agent Milhouse.

01:06:41.554 --> 01:06:43.621
This is Special Agent Barnes.

01:06:43.623 --> 01:06:45.757
- [Barnes] Weird night, huh? God.
- [Milhouse] Yeah.

01:06:45.759 --> 01:06:49.559
A 120 kilos of Norteno Cocaine.

01:06:49.561 --> 01:06:51.996
- A hell of a bust.
- Yeah.

01:06:51.998 --> 01:06:54.799
You know that we had nothing
to do with this, right?

01:06:54.801 --> 01:06:55.933
[Milhouse] Oh!

01:06:55.935 --> 01:06:57.634
So you think
that we just send out

01:06:57.636 --> 01:06:59.706
our whole field office
just for fun?

01:07:00.639 --> 01:07:01.838
This is what we know.

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:03.875
We've been tailing Shope
for three days,

01:07:03.877 --> 01:07:05.442
since he entered
the United States.

01:07:05.444 --> 01:07:07.311
Next thing we know,
the three of you

01:07:07.313 --> 01:07:10.081
are in a Kwik-E-Mart
parking lot free for all.

01:07:10.083 --> 01:07:12.349
So I think we've got
a problem here, don't you?

01:07:12.351 --> 01:07:13.884
Frank, if you wanna get out
of here tonight,

01:07:13.886 --> 01:07:14.951
you've gotta convince us,

01:07:14.953 --> 01:07:17.355
you're not some
big, rich drug lord.

01:07:17.357 --> 01:07:18.523
Like, for real.

01:07:18.525 --> 01:07:20.692
[cell phone ringing]

01:07:20.694 --> 01:07:22.860
[Frank in Japanese accent]
Hello? Mr. Teagarten no home.

01:07:22.862 --> 01:07:24.695
<i>His phone went through
a snow blower,</i>

01:07:24.697 --> 01:07:26.931
<i>and he chop his head right off.</i>

01:07:26.933 --> 01:07:29.936
[light music]

01:07:32.038 --> 01:07:34.404
[Frank] <i>I guess owing 300 bucks
to MasterCard</i>

01:07:34.406 --> 01:07:37.875
<i>helped convince them,
we aren't Mr. and Mrs. El Chapo.</i>

01:07:37.877 --> 01:07:40.511
[Nancy] <i>I can't help thinking
about that little girl.</i>

01:07:40.513 --> 01:07:42.079
[Frank] <i>Nancy,
what are you gonna do?</i>

01:07:42.081 --> 01:07:43.114
<i>Have her come live with us</i>

01:07:43.116 --> 01:07:45.382
<i>in this fucking
Perri Winkle truck?</i>

01:07:45.384 --> 01:07:47.388
[lighter clinks]

01:07:48.554 --> 01:07:49.922
[Frank] God, this day sucked.

01:07:51.757 --> 01:07:52.759
Carl.

01:07:53.793 --> 01:07:55.893
He found my medals.

01:07:55.895 --> 01:07:57.998
- How did he find them?
- He's a sneaky motherfucker.

01:07:59.031 --> 01:08:00.965
But those medals

01:08:00.967 --> 01:08:03.735
made me remember
that I used to win.

01:08:03.737 --> 01:08:06.103
I used to have an edge.

01:08:06.105 --> 01:08:09.676
This week, I've cried more than
I have ever cried before.

01:08:11.143 --> 01:08:13.744
And for things that I would have
never cried about

01:08:13.746 --> 01:08:14.882
in the old days.

01:08:16.915 --> 01:08:19.850
It's like I've become
this person...

01:08:19.852 --> 01:08:21.754
I don't know, and I don't like.

01:08:23.522 --> 01:08:24.590
Where is this headed?

01:08:25.725 --> 01:08:27.425
[sighs]

01:08:27.426 --> 01:08:30.560
- We need to talk to Dan.
- Why? And beg for money?

01:08:30.562 --> 01:08:31.627
That's not getting
your edge back.

01:08:31.630 --> 01:08:33.796
That's surrendering,
not winning.

01:08:33.799 --> 01:08:35.902
Guys like Dan, they take
advantage of weakness.

01:08:38.069 --> 01:08:39.104
I'll figure it out.

01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:42.343
I think.

01:08:44.176 --> 01:08:46.947
I bet Rachel used to take one
of those buses to school.

01:08:47.946 --> 01:08:49.180
Long ago.

01:08:49.182 --> 01:08:51.082
Back in the time
when she used to look up to me

01:08:51.084 --> 01:08:52.486
like I was Superman.

01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:56.586
[sobs]

01:08:56.587 --> 01:08:57.756
Oh, Frank.

01:08:59.625 --> 01:09:00.694
[Frank sniffles]

01:09:02.629 --> 01:09:03.630
You crying?

01:09:05.798 --> 01:09:07.564
You were crying.

01:09:07.566 --> 01:09:09.567
- What a pussy.
- [Frank] No, I'm not crying.

01:09:09.569 --> 01:09:11.769
But if I was, it's because...

01:09:11.770 --> 01:09:13.136
Good god.

01:09:13.138 --> 01:09:14.639
It's because the two
of you reek.

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:15.773
Fuck you.

01:09:15.774 --> 01:09:18.509
Hey, you got ten bucks? For gas?

01:09:18.511 --> 01:09:20.609
Wow, what timing you have, bum.

01:09:20.612 --> 01:09:22.613
No. Actually, we don't have
ten bucks for gas.

01:09:22.615 --> 01:09:24.448
Liar. That's some
high-end furniture

01:09:24.450 --> 01:09:26.050
you got there, you rich asshole.

01:09:26.051 --> 01:09:29.487
Rich? You have completely
misread our situation, my man.

01:09:29.488 --> 01:09:31.689
Oh, whoa, whoa.
I'm not your man.

01:09:31.691 --> 01:09:33.591
He's not your man, fish face.

01:09:33.593 --> 01:09:34.792
[laughs]

01:09:34.794 --> 01:09:36.926
I don't think anybody's ever
called me fish face before.

01:09:36.929 --> 01:09:38.528
- Good.
- You believe this pile

01:09:38.529 --> 01:09:40.765
of fish face,
calling me "his man"?

01:09:40.767 --> 01:09:43.734
I'm not your man, so, fuck you.

01:09:43.736 --> 01:09:45.167
No, no. It's, uh...

01:09:45.170 --> 01:09:46.770
it's more like fuck you.

01:09:46.772 --> 01:09:49.006
I'm sorry, you're not
understanding what we're saying.

01:09:49.008 --> 01:09:50.608
Fuck you.

01:09:50.609 --> 01:09:52.510
- What's your name?
- Will.

01:09:52.511 --> 01:09:53.577
[Frank] What's your name?

01:09:53.578 --> 01:09:54.679
Colin.

01:09:54.681 --> 01:09:55.949
Will, Colin...

01:09:57.115 --> 01:09:58.181
fuck you.

01:09:58.183 --> 01:09:59.716
[rattling]

01:09:59.718 --> 01:10:00.887
[Colin] Fish face.

01:10:06.692 --> 01:10:09.092
[Nancy]
So, how long do we sit here for?

01:10:09.094 --> 01:10:10.630
- [clanking]
- [Frank] I'm not sure.

01:10:11.129 --> 01:10:12.529
Hey!

01:10:12.531 --> 01:10:13.831
What are you doing out there?

01:10:13.833 --> 01:10:15.899
[rattling]

01:10:15.901 --> 01:10:17.103
So, what do we got here?

01:10:18.637 --> 01:10:20.270
- Where's the other bum?
- [Colin] Maui.

01:10:20.272 --> 01:10:22.172
- I could buy a couple of things.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:10:22.174 --> 01:10:23.908
You think this is some kind
of a store?

01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:25.510
What else would you
be doing here?

01:10:25.512 --> 01:10:28.078
Well, actually, it's kind
of a incredible story.

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:29.980
- Nancy!
- [Colin] How much for the paint?

01:10:29.982 --> 01:10:31.616
Spray paint,
I'd like to huff it.

01:10:31.618 --> 01:10:32.984
[Frank] You wanna huff it?

01:10:32.986 --> 01:10:34.719
You wanna huff the can
of spray paint?

01:10:34.721 --> 01:10:36.953
You're like the worst bum ever.

01:10:36.955 --> 01:10:38.055
What is it, a pageant?

01:10:38.057 --> 01:10:39.590
[Frank] And you came in last.

01:10:39.592 --> 01:10:41.759
- Okay, five bucks.
- Five bucks?

01:10:41.761 --> 01:10:43.060
For a can of paint?

01:10:43.062 --> 01:10:44.628
That's what I said.
Five bucks, yes or no.

01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:46.631
There's a line forming
behind you.

01:10:46.633 --> 01:10:47.864
Ah! I made you look,

01:10:47.866 --> 01:10:49.634
- you fucking idiot.
- [both laughing]

01:10:49.636 --> 01:10:51.138
- Fuck off.
- [liquid trickling]

01:10:54.307 --> 01:10:56.040
Stop lookin' at me!

01:10:56.042 --> 01:10:57.942
Get away from the gas tank, bum.

01:10:57.944 --> 01:10:59.010
Fuck you!

01:10:59.012 --> 01:11:00.144
[explosion]

01:11:00.146 --> 01:11:02.046
[Will screaming]

01:11:02.048 --> 01:11:03.050
[screams]

01:11:03.850 --> 01:11:05.049
Stop and drop!

01:11:05.051 --> 01:11:06.617
[Will shrieks]

01:11:06.619 --> 01:11:08.920
- [Will] Why is this happening?
- You're on fire!

01:11:08.922 --> 01:11:11.154
Frank! Get this man
an extinguisher!

01:11:11.156 --> 01:11:12.223
- [Frank grunts]
- [Will screams]

01:11:12.225 --> 01:11:14.158
You're just gonna stand there?

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:15.626
He's on fire!

01:11:15.628 --> 01:11:17.595
[Will] I don't need this shit
in my life!

01:11:17.597 --> 01:11:21.933
[Nancy screaming in Spanish]

01:11:21.935 --> 01:11:23.167
[Will groaning]

01:11:23.169 --> 01:11:24.268
[Wil] Oh, yeah.

01:11:24.270 --> 01:11:25.670
Lie on me.

01:11:25.672 --> 01:11:27.003
Yeah, get on me, girl.

01:11:27.005 --> 01:11:29.840
Uh, yeah.
Grind me out like a cigarette.

01:11:29.842 --> 01:11:32.743
Oh! Yeah. Let me...
Let me return the favor.

01:11:32.745 --> 01:11:35.179
- I'm anything but a gentleman.
- [Nancy] Are you kidding?

01:11:35.181 --> 01:11:36.346
[extinguisher hisses]

01:11:36.348 --> 01:11:37.848
That's my wife, bum.

01:11:37.850 --> 01:11:39.350
[hissing]

01:11:39.352 --> 01:11:41.051
[Nancy and Will coughing]

01:11:41.053 --> 01:11:43.921
- She got on me, dude!
- [Nancy coughs]

01:11:43.923 --> 01:11:46.223
- [Colin] Hey!
- [Will coughs]

01:11:46.225 --> 01:11:48.629
Bum, put those lamps back.

01:11:49.963 --> 01:11:53.264
- So, that's the basic concept.
- Mm.

01:11:53.266 --> 01:11:56.033
Sounds like a good idea.
What, you're calling it, uh,

01:11:56.035 --> 01:11:58.034
- YardBay?
- YardBay.

01:11:58.036 --> 01:11:59.769
Great name for a great idea.

01:11:59.771 --> 01:12:01.137
Well, it's Frank's idea.

01:12:01.139 --> 01:12:02.372
You hear that, bums?

01:12:02.374 --> 01:12:04.308
The great idea was my idea.

01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:06.844
Shovel swinging in your face
would be a good idea.

01:12:06.846 --> 01:12:09.246
[all laughing]

01:12:09.248 --> 01:12:11.047
He already did that.

01:12:11.049 --> 01:12:13.083
While smoking a spider.

01:12:13.085 --> 01:12:14.251
[all laughing]

01:12:14.253 --> 01:12:15.786
[Will] Oh, I believe it.

01:12:15.788 --> 01:12:17.188
'Cause he's a huge dumbass.

01:12:17.190 --> 01:12:18.855
Look at his fat fish face.

01:12:18.857 --> 01:12:20.658
[Will laughs]

01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:23.063
Frank is a banana split of shit.

01:12:24.230 --> 01:12:25.095
I don't like that.

01:12:25.097 --> 01:12:27.331
I hate to say it,
but Frank is right

01:12:27.333 --> 01:12:28.335
about one thing.

01:12:29.168 --> 01:12:30.203
You got a good idea.

01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:32.135
Okay?

01:12:32.137 --> 01:12:35.305
But you gotta go in strong when
you're dealing with rich people.

01:12:35.307 --> 01:12:37.174
- Otherwise, they'll prey on you.
- [metal clanks]

01:12:37.176 --> 01:12:38.842
- [Will] I would know that...
- [liquid trickling]

01:12:38.844 --> 01:12:40.043
- ...because I used to be...
- [lighter clicks]

01:12:40.045 --> 01:12:42.078
- ...one of those people.
- [explosion]

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:43.146
[Colin screams]

01:12:43.148 --> 01:12:44.718
[Colin] Put me out, fish face!

01:12:45.218 --> 01:12:46.716
[screams]

01:12:46.718 --> 01:12:48.221
- [screaming continues]
- [extinguisher hissing]

01:12:50.722 --> 01:12:53.123
[Colin] All right,
I'm out. I'm out.

01:12:53.125 --> 01:12:54.692
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:12:54.694 --> 01:12:55.792
What happened?

01:12:55.794 --> 01:12:57.094
Oh. Cigarette.

01:12:57.096 --> 01:12:58.996
Ah, yeah.
Same thing happened to me.

01:12:58.998 --> 01:13:00.997
- Feel stupid.
- Yeah.

01:13:00.999 --> 01:13:03.367
All right, well, goodbye, Frank.

01:13:03.369 --> 01:13:05.135
Hope a train falls on your face.

01:13:05.137 --> 01:13:06.836
[laughs]

01:13:06.838 --> 01:13:09.375
Go siphon some gas
and smoke a cigarette, bum.

01:13:10.776 --> 01:13:11.811
Touché.

01:13:13.312 --> 01:13:15.078
[Will]
You sure you're all right?

01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:16.413
- [Colin] Yeah.
- [Will] I did the same thing,

01:13:16.415 --> 01:13:18.448
and next thing you know,
the flames just jump on you.

01:13:18.450 --> 01:13:19.750
[Colin] You think
it's the cigarette, or...

01:13:19.752 --> 01:13:21.418
[Will] Fifty-fifty chance.

01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:22.655
They were sweet.

01:13:24.456 --> 01:13:25.726
Colin and Will.

01:13:26.959 --> 01:13:27.961
Fuck them.

01:13:30.730 --> 01:13:33.064
[lively music]

01:13:33.066 --> 01:13:34.334
[whirring]

01:13:39.938 --> 01:13:41.941
[Rachel] Why is there furniture
on the lawn?

01:13:45.911 --> 01:13:48.045
[Jessie]
Maybe they were partying.

01:13:48.047 --> 01:13:50.180
[Rachel]
They're not like that, Jessie.

01:13:50.182 --> 01:13:51.782
[car door closes]

01:13:51.784 --> 01:13:52.716
You coming inside?

01:13:52.718 --> 01:13:54.885
I wanna start setting up
for the surprise.

01:13:54.887 --> 01:13:56.420
Um, yeah, in a minute.

01:13:56.422 --> 01:13:57.488
I, I got the spins,

01:13:57.490 --> 01:13:59.924
I'm just gonna go back to bed
for a little bit.

01:13:59.926 --> 01:14:00.960
- Okay.
- [car door closes]

01:14:03.963 --> 01:14:05.432
[clacking]

01:14:07.467 --> 01:14:08.835
[Rachel] That's weird.

01:14:10.503 --> 01:14:12.202
[Carl] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:14:12.204 --> 01:14:14.805
Hey. If you're here
for the yard sale,

01:14:14.807 --> 01:14:16.207
it's in the yard.

01:14:16.209 --> 01:14:18.175
- Who are you?
- [Carl] Who am I?

01:14:18.177 --> 01:14:20.110
I'm a guy holding pepper spray.

01:14:20.112 --> 01:14:21.912
Twelve ounces...

01:14:21.914 --> 01:14:24.148
Three ounces of pepper spray
at your eyes.

01:14:24.150 --> 01:14:26.317
All right? Who are you?

01:14:26.319 --> 01:14:29.353
I'm Rachel. I live here.

01:14:29.355 --> 01:14:31.055
Oh, my god.

01:14:31.057 --> 01:14:32.355
- Rachel?
- [Rachel] Yeah.

01:14:32.357 --> 01:14:34.091
Oh, I've heard so much
about you.

01:14:34.093 --> 01:14:35.359
[laughs]

01:14:35.361 --> 01:14:36.363
I'm Carl.

01:14:38.931 --> 01:14:40.163
Carl,

01:14:40.165 --> 01:14:42.936
I think you're gonna need to
explain to me what's going on.

01:14:43.436 --> 01:14:45.072
[rattling]

01:14:45.937 --> 01:14:47.037
Oh!

01:14:47.039 --> 01:14:49.873
Baby, I think
I figured something out,

01:14:49.875 --> 01:14:51.341
and we're gonna call it,

01:14:51.343 --> 01:14:52.712
"The Carl."

01:14:55.013 --> 01:14:56.048
Feeling good?

01:14:56.915 --> 01:14:58.448
If good means nervous.

01:14:58.450 --> 01:14:59.716
[Frank] <i>A Baby Ruth?</i>

01:14:59.718 --> 01:15:02.489
[Nancy] <i>Sometimes a Baby Ruth
is just a candy bar.</i>

01:15:06.926 --> 01:15:10.094
The tournament is canceled
but I'm sure Dan is still here.

01:15:10.096 --> 01:15:11.427
[Nancy] This has to work.

01:15:11.429 --> 01:15:12.962
[Frank] You heard
what those bums said,

01:15:12.964 --> 01:15:15.466
we have to make these rich guys
wanna give us money.

01:15:15.468 --> 01:15:17.434
Make 'em need to give it to us.

01:15:17.436 --> 01:15:19.336
It's fourth in goal,
no time on the clock,

01:15:19.338 --> 01:15:21.808
you got the ball,
and I'll just follow your lead.

01:15:24.544 --> 01:15:26.046
[truck door opens]

01:15:28.548 --> 01:15:30.079
Keep it close.

01:15:30.081 --> 01:15:31.815
[keys jingle]

01:15:31.817 --> 01:15:32.852
Oh no, that's not...

01:15:33.852 --> 01:15:34.952
"fuck you."

01:15:34.954 --> 01:15:36.186
- That's...
- [truck door closes]

01:15:36.188 --> 01:15:37.423
...somebody else.

01:15:38.191 --> 01:15:39.359
Can you wash it?

01:15:40.258 --> 01:15:41.261
That's fine.

01:15:42.495 --> 01:15:44.994
I have to go to the locker room
to clean up,

01:15:44.996 --> 01:15:46.529
and put on my secret weapon.

01:15:46.531 --> 01:15:47.967
- Meet you at the golf carts.
- Okay.

01:15:49.869 --> 01:15:51.034
[Rachel] <i>Okay, well then,</i>

01:15:51.036 --> 01:15:52.970
where did they go after that?

01:15:52.972 --> 01:15:54.939
[scoffs]
I don't know.

01:15:54.941 --> 01:15:57.878
I mean, it seems to change
every 16 minutes.

01:15:58.844 --> 01:16:00.510
Frankly, I'm worried.

01:16:00.512 --> 01:16:02.579
And your mother, I mean,

01:16:02.581 --> 01:16:05.015
maybe you know her
better than me,

01:16:05.017 --> 01:16:07.350
but she seems a little unhinged.

01:16:07.352 --> 01:16:09.118
But the point is,

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:11.188
I think your surprise
birthday party

01:16:11.190 --> 01:16:12.622
is a wonderful idea.

01:16:12.624 --> 01:16:14.291
Have you ever seen
<i>The Wedding Planner?</i>

01:16:14.293 --> 01:16:15.592
- [Rachel] Mm.
- With J-Lo?

01:16:15.594 --> 01:16:18.162
Uh, that's short
for Jennifer Lopez.

01:16:18.164 --> 01:16:20.230
Anyway, I love J-Lo,

01:16:20.232 --> 01:16:22.533
and not just because she's
a fellow Latina.

01:16:22.535 --> 01:16:24.400
I love her for her dancing.

01:16:24.402 --> 01:16:26.269
I love her for her singing.

01:16:26.271 --> 01:16:27.938
I love her for her acting.

01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:29.573
But I never liked her perfume.

01:16:29.575 --> 01:16:31.074
It was gross.

01:16:31.076 --> 01:16:33.077
Carl...
[chuckles]

01:16:33.079 --> 01:16:35.578
I don't think
we're gonna have a party.

01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:37.113
I need to call my Aunt Betty...

01:16:37.115 --> 01:16:38.181
[Jessie] Okay.

01:16:38.183 --> 01:16:40.417
I need, like, 12 billion aspirin

01:16:40.419 --> 01:16:42.286
and one ounce...
[mumbles]

01:16:42.288 --> 01:16:43.354
[whispers]
Oh, my god!

01:16:43.356 --> 01:16:46.090
who is this hunk
of stud hunk, oh...

01:16:46.092 --> 01:16:48.058
Jessie, this is Carl.

01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:49.426
He's...

01:16:49.428 --> 01:16:51.261
I guess, staying with us.

01:16:51.263 --> 01:16:52.997
[Jessie] Hi.

01:16:52.999 --> 01:16:54.564
- I'm Jessie.
- Hi.

01:16:54.566 --> 01:16:56.000
Nice to meet you.

01:16:56.002 --> 01:16:57.635
[stammers]
Did you just

01:16:57.637 --> 01:17:00.037
call me a "hunk of stud"?

01:17:00.039 --> 01:17:01.572
If I was a shark, man,

01:17:01.574 --> 01:17:02.672
I would just...

01:17:02.674 --> 01:17:04.408
[hisses]
...chomp into you

01:17:04.410 --> 01:17:06.213
like a little baby seal.

01:17:11.918 --> 01:17:13.250
Please, God.

01:17:13.252 --> 01:17:15.219
Don't let this be
a fucking dream.

01:17:15.221 --> 01:17:17.324
[coughing]

01:17:18.624 --> 01:17:19.993
[laughs, coughs]

01:17:22.495 --> 01:17:23.560
Hey, Andy.

01:17:23.562 --> 01:17:24.694
Danny boy.

01:17:24.696 --> 01:17:26.229
[Nancy laughs]

01:17:26.231 --> 01:17:27.530
Mm.

01:17:27.532 --> 01:17:29.099
Look at that,
there's Nancy at the bar.

01:17:29.101 --> 01:17:30.167
Ooh.

01:17:30.169 --> 01:17:31.435
[Nancy] <i>Salut.</i>

01:17:31.437 --> 01:17:33.369
Fancy Nancy.

01:17:33.371 --> 01:17:34.438
- Hey, guys.
- [all] Oh!

01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:36.105
- Hi!
- Hey, Frank.

01:17:36.107 --> 01:17:38.074
- Yeah, she's having a few.
- [Nancy laughs]

01:17:38.076 --> 01:17:39.976
Right now, she couldn't see
the hole in a ladder.

01:17:39.978 --> 01:17:41.511
[all laugh]

01:17:41.513 --> 01:17:43.180
We're both celebrating
some good news.

01:17:43.182 --> 01:17:45.181
Oh, yeah?
What good news is that?

01:17:45.183 --> 01:17:46.716
Some Silicon Valley news.

01:17:46.718 --> 01:17:48.185
- Oh?
- Ooh.

01:17:48.187 --> 01:17:50.453
Hi, guys!

01:17:50.455 --> 01:17:52.221
Oh, bummer!

01:17:52.223 --> 01:17:54.358
They canceled your game.

01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:55.359
[Dan] I know, I know.

01:17:55.361 --> 01:17:57.694
- White balls, white snow...
- Well, white balls

01:17:57.696 --> 01:17:59.063
are better than blue.

01:17:59.065 --> 01:18:01.064
- [all laugh]
- You ever run track?

01:18:01.066 --> 01:18:03.233
- Ever run track? Ever run track?
- Mm-hm. Two.

01:18:03.235 --> 01:18:04.435
[Dan chuckles]
You mean with our feet?

01:18:04.437 --> 01:18:05.568
That's why
they have golf carts...

01:18:05.570 --> 01:18:07.637
[Nancy]
Hey, stop right there, baby.

01:18:07.639 --> 01:18:11.140
I need you to pay attention
and to focus,

01:18:11.142 --> 01:18:14.110
because I'm about
to organize you.

01:18:14.112 --> 01:18:15.378
Uh, baby can we talk
for a second.

01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:16.447
No.

01:18:16.449 --> 01:18:17.648
[Frank] No. Honey, I think...

01:18:17.650 --> 01:18:20.516
I talk to you all the time,
I'm sick of talking to you.

01:18:20.518 --> 01:18:23.022
I wanna talk to them.
Stop trying to control me.

01:18:24.557 --> 01:18:26.092
Enjoy the moment, fellas.

01:18:27.159 --> 01:18:28.725
Well,

01:18:28.727 --> 01:18:32.363
I used to run
four-person relays,

01:18:32.365 --> 01:18:34.264
and this is how it works.

01:18:34.266 --> 01:18:36.734
The second fastest runner

01:18:36.736 --> 01:18:39.036
usually starts the race.

01:18:39.038 --> 01:18:42.672
That fucker needs
to get a good lead.

01:18:42.674 --> 01:18:46.443
- Andy, smart, hard worker.
- Mm-hm.

01:18:46.445 --> 01:18:49.246
You've earned your money.

01:18:49.248 --> 01:18:50.314
Yes.

01:18:50.316 --> 01:18:53.684
So, I am going to make you...

01:18:53.686 --> 01:18:56.052
- [Andy grunts]
- ...the first runner.

01:18:56.054 --> 01:18:57.253
- [Andy chuckles]
- Come with me.

01:18:57.255 --> 01:18:58.354
[chuckles]

01:18:58.356 --> 01:19:01.759
The second runner needs
to be solid,

01:19:01.761 --> 01:19:04.228
and dependable.

01:19:04.230 --> 01:19:05.328
That's you, Steve.

01:19:05.330 --> 01:19:07.663
You've done well in Wall Street,

01:19:07.665 --> 01:19:10.235
but you've never done
anything...

01:19:12.103 --> 01:19:14.238
- flashy.
- [all laugh]

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:16.273
- [Nancy] I am so sorry, Rob,
- Huh?

01:19:16.275 --> 01:19:21.677
but the slowest runner
always runs third.

01:19:21.679 --> 01:19:23.514
I know that you're rich,

01:19:23.516 --> 01:19:26.116
but it's family money, baby.

01:19:26.118 --> 01:19:29.086
You need to be hungry.

01:19:29.088 --> 01:19:30.653
Maybe today,

01:19:30.655 --> 01:19:32.823
shock us, baby, please.

01:19:32.825 --> 01:19:34.390
[Rob clears throat]

01:19:34.392 --> 01:19:36.562
And you, my Danny boy.

01:19:38.463 --> 01:19:41.064
- You're fourth.
- I'm never fourth.

01:19:41.066 --> 01:19:44.234
But the fourth runner
it's always the fastest runner.

01:19:44.236 --> 01:19:45.402
Ahh.

01:19:45.404 --> 01:19:49.372
He's also the smartest runner.

01:19:49.374 --> 01:19:52.643
Because he knows
what it takes to win.

01:19:52.645 --> 01:19:56.646
Either dig deep to make up
for the lost time,

01:19:56.648 --> 01:20:00.117
or run just fast enough
to hold the lead.

01:20:00.119 --> 01:20:04.087
I was always the fourth runner.

01:20:04.089 --> 01:20:07.761
Because I was very, very good.

01:20:08.660 --> 01:20:11.795
So, let's stretch.

01:20:11.797 --> 01:20:14.230
Warm up.

01:20:14.232 --> 01:20:16.332
And assume the position.

01:20:16.334 --> 01:20:17.835
Okay, now I like this part.

01:20:17.837 --> 01:20:20.269
[laughs]
Isn't she something?

01:20:20.271 --> 01:20:21.337
Stand up, baby.

01:20:21.339 --> 01:20:23.439
So now what, we actually run?

01:20:23.441 --> 01:20:26.609
Yes, and Frank is going
to tell you

01:20:26.611 --> 01:20:28.511
- what's at the finish line.
- No. no, baby.

01:20:28.513 --> 01:20:31.448
We have no more room
for investors...

01:20:31.450 --> 01:20:32.815
- [Andy] Come on, Frank.
- [Nancy] Please, please, Frank.

01:20:32.817 --> 01:20:35.885
I mean, you cannot trust
those millionaires

01:20:35.887 --> 01:20:38.421
from Silicon Valley.

01:20:38.423 --> 01:20:40.524
Silicon is fake,

01:20:40.526 --> 01:20:43.327
like the fake silicon boobs.

01:20:43.329 --> 01:20:45.229
They're fake millionaires,
they're nouveau rich!

01:20:45.231 --> 01:20:46.462
It's just a pitch, it's a pitch.

01:20:46.464 --> 01:20:48.398
- Now you have to tell him about
- Ah, give it up.

01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:49.565
- the pig.
- Give it up. Say the pitch.

01:20:49.567 --> 01:20:51.234
- Come on.
- Tell them about the pig.

01:20:51.236 --> 01:20:52.536
- The pig!
- [Frank] All right, all right.

01:20:52.538 --> 01:20:53.604
All right, all right.

01:20:53.606 --> 01:20:54.607
Okay.

01:20:55.406 --> 01:20:56.640
You know the phrase,

01:20:56.642 --> 01:20:58.211
"Burn down the house
to cook the pig"?

01:20:59.378 --> 01:21:00.610
You don't have a lot
of house left

01:21:00.612 --> 01:21:01.780
but you have a lot
of cooked pig?

01:21:03.382 --> 01:21:04.848
All the bankruptcy filings
in this country.

01:21:04.850 --> 01:21:06.250
Right now,
people have lost everything.

01:21:06.252 --> 01:21:07.654
They gambled
and they got wiped out.

01:21:08.721 --> 01:21:10.253
Have I got your attention?

01:21:10.255 --> 01:21:13.258
[foreboding music]

01:21:13.726 --> 01:21:15.559
We...

01:21:15.561 --> 01:21:17.860
help them sell
the barbecued pork.

01:21:17.862 --> 01:21:21.700
People browse yard sales
from home.

01:21:22.634 --> 01:21:24.137
It's called YardBay.

01:21:25.905 --> 01:21:27.206
Yeah, baby.

01:21:30.441 --> 01:21:31.444
I like it.

01:21:32.178 --> 01:21:33.577
I like it.

01:21:33.579 --> 01:21:34.677
Let's talk.

01:21:34.679 --> 01:21:36.680
[Nancy] And the winner is...

01:21:36.682 --> 01:21:37.948
Dan!

01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:40.884
[Frank laughing]
My wife is so fucking drunk.

01:21:40.886 --> 01:21:42.418
[Nancy]
Your acting was brilliant.

01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:43.487
[Frank] Well, I couldn't have
gotten home

01:21:43.489 --> 01:21:44.787
if you didn't put me
on third, baby.

01:21:44.789 --> 01:21:46.189
[whispers]
I feel great.

01:21:46.191 --> 01:21:47.424
Oh, it really was, wasn't it?

01:21:47.426 --> 01:21:49.225
[Nancy] <i>I just did a "Carl."</i>

01:21:49.227 --> 01:21:52.461
<i>My crazy made you look good,
and now they want YardBay!</i>

01:21:52.463 --> 01:21:54.198
[Frank] <i>I'm gonna call Jason.
I need to have something</i>

01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:55.933
<i>to show Dan over lunch tomorrow.</i>

01:21:55.935 --> 01:21:57.137
[Nancy] <i>Yes!</i>

01:21:58.236 --> 01:21:59.869
[Nancy] <i>Oh, Frank, is it over?</i>

01:21:59.871 --> 01:22:02.706
<i>Are we finally out
of this shitstorm?</i>

01:22:02.708 --> 01:22:04.942
<i>I don't know how, but I think
we did it, didn't we?</i>

01:22:04.944 --> 01:22:06.846
[Frank] <i>Who said
you can't unring a bell?</i>

01:22:08.347 --> 01:22:10.346
Mom, Dad...

01:22:10.348 --> 01:22:11.415
Rachel.

01:22:11.417 --> 01:22:12.849
[stammers]
I'm with...

01:22:12.851 --> 01:22:14.751
And I see you've met Carl.

01:22:14.753 --> 01:22:16.452
Nancy, I've been so worried.

01:22:16.454 --> 01:22:18.221
Carl told me everything.

01:22:18.223 --> 01:22:19.890
I've tried piecing it together,
but...

01:22:19.892 --> 01:22:20.957
[stutters]

01:22:20.959 --> 01:22:22.391
I don't know.

01:22:22.393 --> 01:22:23.627
I called Aunt Betty.

01:22:23.629 --> 01:22:25.362
She's on her way here.

01:22:25.364 --> 01:22:26.329
Great.

01:22:26.331 --> 01:22:29.699
- [cell phone ringing]
- Honey, it's Nigel.

01:22:29.701 --> 01:22:31.236
- Yes.
- [Nancy] No.

01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:32.568
Nige.

01:22:32.570 --> 01:22:34.871
I'm sorry,
did you just call me "Nige"?

01:22:34.873 --> 01:22:36.006
[Frank] <i>Uh, it's possible.</i>

01:22:36.008 --> 01:22:37.841
I knew a guy
named "Adolf Dick" once,

01:22:37.843 --> 01:22:39.775
- that's a tough name, isn't it?
- [Nigel] <i>Listen.</i>

01:22:39.777 --> 01:22:42.546
I just had
an amazing conversation

01:22:42.548 --> 01:22:43.680
with the police.

01:22:43.682 --> 01:22:47.684
Who informed me that my house
has been burglarized!

01:22:47.686 --> 01:22:49.752
<i>I am about to board this flight,</i>

01:22:49.754 --> 01:22:52.889
and come home and start ripping
some new assholes.

01:22:52.891 --> 01:22:54.558
- All right?
- [Frank] <i>No, no.</i>

01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:56.493
They caught the culprit,
everything's back in the house.

01:22:56.495 --> 01:22:58.362
It's all good
in the hood, Nigel.

01:22:58.364 --> 01:22:59.563
Oh.

01:22:59.565 --> 01:23:01.797
Oh, the police found him?
They didn't let me know that.

01:23:01.799 --> 01:23:04.033
[Nigel] <i>All right, listen.
I want the perpetrators.</i>

01:23:04.035 --> 01:23:05.601
I want them prosecuted.

01:23:05.603 --> 01:23:07.537
And I want them
sent to jail, okay?

01:23:07.539 --> 01:23:08.604
[Frank] <i>No, no, Nigel.</i>

01:23:08.606 --> 01:23:11.707
The thief was hit by a car
and a bike and a rock.

01:23:11.709 --> 01:23:12.975
[Frank]
<i>Isn't that punishment enough?</i>

01:23:12.977 --> 01:23:16.613
You know, even 5,000 miles away,
I can still smell the bullshit.

01:23:16.615 --> 01:23:17.713
I'm getting on this plane.

01:23:17.715 --> 01:23:19.649
Or, I could go take a picture
of your living room

01:23:19.651 --> 01:23:20.518
and send it to you.

01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:23.319
And you could see
how it's pristine.

01:23:23.321 --> 01:23:24.988
[man speaking
indistinctly on PA]

01:23:24.990 --> 01:23:26.392
Yeah. Send it.

01:23:27.593 --> 01:23:29.059
[groans]

01:23:29.061 --> 01:23:31.297
[indistinct chatter]

01:23:32.798 --> 01:23:36.533
Rachel, I understand
that you must be mad.

01:23:36.535 --> 01:23:39.368
Mom, I'm mad
that you didn't trust me enough

01:23:39.370 --> 01:23:40.973
to tell me what was going on.

01:23:41.673 --> 01:23:42.708
And also...

01:23:44.043 --> 01:23:46.542
I'm mad that I missed out
on seeing

01:23:46.544 --> 01:23:49.412
my amazing parents in action.

01:23:49.414 --> 01:23:50.716
I wish I could've been there...

01:23:51.950 --> 01:23:54.454
because I'll never stop learning
from you, guys.

01:23:55.954 --> 01:23:57.520
Rachel.

01:23:57.522 --> 01:23:59.525
[car approaching]

01:24:02.026 --> 01:24:04.396
Go upstairs to my closet.
It's now a panic room.

01:24:05.897 --> 01:24:07.930
Hey, pervert.

01:24:07.932 --> 01:24:09.901
What did we tell you
about coming back here?

01:24:11.736 --> 01:24:12.802
[yelps]

01:24:12.804 --> 01:24:13.806
[tray clinks]

01:24:14.839 --> 01:24:16.038
Where's the main deviant?

01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:17.107
[Rachel] Jason?

01:24:17.109 --> 01:24:18.875
Don't worry, Rach.

01:24:18.877 --> 01:24:20.911
- I got this.
- [Nancy] No, Jason.

01:24:20.913 --> 01:24:22.778
Don't mess with these guys.

01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:25.515
Frank, we have a <i>problema!</i>

01:24:25.517 --> 01:24:26.515
No, no, no.

01:24:26.517 --> 01:24:29.819
Nobody speaks to Mrs. Teagarten
like that. Huh.

01:24:29.821 --> 01:24:31.387
[man 1] What you got there,
ironsides?

01:24:31.389 --> 01:24:33.357
- A cap gun?
- Tasers.

01:24:33.359 --> 01:24:34.623
I carry rent money.

01:24:34.625 --> 01:24:35.725
[horn honks]

01:24:35.727 --> 01:24:37.062
[tires screeching]

01:24:38.396 --> 01:24:39.496
[car door opens]

01:24:39.498 --> 01:24:41.665
Holy shit!
Those are police tasers.

01:24:41.667 --> 01:24:43.600
Oh, I want that fucker.

01:24:43.602 --> 01:24:44.768
- Be prepared to meet your...
- Give me one.

01:24:44.770 --> 01:24:47.037
Hey, kids. What are you guys
doing here?

01:24:47.039 --> 01:24:48.505
All right,
I'm just right in the middle

01:24:48.507 --> 01:24:49.439
of something super important.

01:24:49.441 --> 01:24:50.806
[Tristan]
We really don't fucking care.

01:24:50.808 --> 01:24:51.942
[Trey] Back off,
you stupid fuck.

01:24:51.944 --> 01:24:53.443
- [Tristan] Fight me!
- Who are you kids?

01:24:53.445 --> 01:24:54.411
Please leave me be...

01:24:54.413 --> 01:24:56.645
- Suck a fat one!
- My girlfriend is watching!

01:24:56.647 --> 01:24:57.948
- Fucking pussy!
- Take the tasers.

01:24:57.950 --> 01:24:59.616
You wore me down.

01:24:59.618 --> 01:25:00.620
Oh, shit.

01:25:02.053 --> 01:25:04.653
- Who are you?
- I'm plumber.

01:25:04.655 --> 01:25:06.088
- [thwacks]
- [both grunt]

01:25:06.090 --> 01:25:08.457
Ready for some shock
and awe, fuckers?

01:25:08.459 --> 01:25:09.525
[Trey] Amen.

01:25:09.527 --> 01:25:11.563
- [stun gun crackling]
- [groaning]

01:25:12.697 --> 01:25:14.698
[Trey] Kneel before your god.

01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:16.666
You guys are wonderful children.
Both of you.

01:25:16.668 --> 01:25:18.103
- All right, guys.
- [both squealing]

01:25:19.471 --> 01:25:20.636
All right, we're good.

01:25:20.638 --> 01:25:22.738
Dad, for once, we're having
fucking fun in our lives,

01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:24.006
because you never gave us
a good childhood,

01:25:24.008 --> 01:25:25.811
so can you just like,
let us have fun?

01:25:26.879 --> 01:25:27.943
[both groaning]

01:25:27.945 --> 01:25:29.011
Pfft.

01:25:29.013 --> 01:25:30.516
- [stun gun crackling]
- [screaming]

01:25:33.619 --> 01:25:35.885
[groaning]

01:25:35.887 --> 01:25:36.952
Nice.

01:25:36.954 --> 01:25:38.188
- All right.
- <i>Ay, mi amor.</i>

01:25:38.190 --> 01:25:39.555
- We're done.
- That was amazing.

01:25:39.557 --> 01:25:40.726
Thanks, baby.

01:25:42.828 --> 01:25:45.429
Okay, I understand the impulse.

01:25:45.431 --> 01:25:48.165
But let's have no more
of this vigilante justice, okay?

01:25:48.167 --> 01:25:50.033
We have to have law and order.
Believe me, I would know.

01:25:50.035 --> 01:25:52.435
[car engine revving]

01:25:52.437 --> 01:25:53.772
[tires screeching]

01:25:57.942 --> 01:25:59.943
All right, listen up.

01:25:59.945 --> 01:26:02.415
We've got two minutes.
Everything inside.

01:26:04.749 --> 01:26:06.683
Sir, you really need to board.

01:26:06.685 --> 01:26:08.020
Yeah, all right,
all right, all right.

01:26:11.222 --> 01:26:12.288
All right, uh,

01:26:12.290 --> 01:26:15.091
pull my bags off the plane,
I'm going to Nepal.

01:26:15.093 --> 01:26:16.560
You can't be serious.

01:26:16.562 --> 01:26:18.929
Yeah, hurry up. Come on, lady!
Let's go.

01:26:18.931 --> 01:26:20.229
Pull the trigger on my bags.

01:26:20.231 --> 01:26:21.564
Uh...

01:26:21.566 --> 01:26:24.167
Airport security to Gate B31.

01:26:24.169 --> 01:26:26.569
Wait, why?
'Cause I called you "lady"?

01:26:26.571 --> 01:26:27.570
You said the word "trigger."

01:26:27.572 --> 01:26:29.706
It's not a great word
around here, these days.

01:26:29.708 --> 01:26:32.475
Oh, you called the pigs,
you fucking stupid...

01:26:32.477 --> 01:26:33.344
Oh, you...

01:26:33.346 --> 01:26:35.211
That... He is a lady,
that's his...

01:26:35.213 --> 01:26:36.479
Oh, fuck!

01:26:36.481 --> 01:26:38.081
- [ice rattles]

01:26:38.083 --> 01:26:40.082

01:26:40.084 --> 01:26:43.088
[lively music]

01:26:54.633 --> 01:26:57.637
[lively music continues]

01:26:59.504 --> 01:27:00.572
[car door opens]

01:27:01.539 --> 01:27:02.973
[woman] Good luck.

01:27:02.975 --> 01:27:04.174
[Nancy] Bye.

01:27:04.176 --> 01:27:05.242
[Nancy] Oh, Frank.

01:27:05.244 --> 01:27:08.144
[Frank] So, I can't talk you
out of this, right?

01:27:08.146 --> 01:27:09.912
No, honey, you can't.

01:27:09.914 --> 01:27:11.917
Good. More than good.

01:27:14.553 --> 01:27:17.089
[airplane engine whirring]

01:27:25.263 --> 01:27:28.467
[light music]

01:27:30.602 --> 01:27:31.671
[Nancy] Is this Rose?

01:27:33.605 --> 01:27:35.872
Hi Rose, I am Nancy.

01:27:35.874 --> 01:27:37.607
Where's my daddy?

01:27:37.609 --> 01:27:39.009
Your daddy couldn't come.

01:27:39.011 --> 01:27:40.010
But he sent me to get you,

01:27:40.012 --> 01:27:42.311
and you're going
to see him really, really soon.

01:27:42.313 --> 01:27:43.380
Meanwhile,

01:27:43.382 --> 01:27:46.582
I'm gonna be taking care of you.
Is that all right?

01:27:46.584 --> 01:27:50.052
Is he in jail?
Sometimes he goes to jail.

01:27:50.054 --> 01:27:53.622
You shouldn't worry about that,
you must be so tired.

01:27:53.624 --> 01:27:55.527
And what about hungry,
are you hungry?

01:27:57.295 --> 01:27:59.194
Thank you very much.

01:27:59.196 --> 01:28:01.864
You're so brave
that you came all that way.

01:28:01.866 --> 01:28:03.899
- Were you scared?
- A little.

01:28:03.901 --> 01:28:07.002
[uplifting music]

01:28:07.004 --> 01:28:09.842
[indistinct chatter]

01:28:14.780 --> 01:28:16.246
[Trey] Turkey, turkey!

01:28:16.248 --> 01:28:18.113
- [indistinct chatter]
- [laughing]

01:28:18.115 --> 01:28:20.116
[clinking]

01:28:20.118 --> 01:28:22.685
O. Henry once said,
that "Love and family

01:28:22.687 --> 01:28:25.154
and country are nothing
but shadows of words

01:28:25.156 --> 01:28:27.056
when a man is starving."

01:28:27.058 --> 01:28:29.059
Uh, and today,
we are not starving.

01:28:29.061 --> 01:28:30.760
Yeah. I'm glad you're all here.

01:28:30.762 --> 01:28:32.362
[in sarcastic voice]
"O. Henry once said,

01:28:32.364 --> 01:28:34.898
that love and family and country

01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:37.600
all together is..."

01:28:37.602 --> 01:28:38.737
Uh...

01:28:41.706 --> 01:28:43.609
You're right. I'm a douche.

01:28:45.243 --> 01:28:46.943
[laughs]
Yes!

01:28:46.945 --> 01:28:48.377
Yes!

01:28:48.379 --> 01:28:51.146
You most certainly are a douche.

01:28:51.148 --> 01:28:53.617
[all laugh]

01:28:53.619 --> 01:28:55.719
And that is the first step
towards recovery.

01:28:55.721 --> 01:28:57.086
- Thank you.
- [glass clinks]

01:28:57.088 --> 01:29:00.090
Okay, okay, here we go.

01:29:00.092 --> 01:29:01.957
I'm thankful that we got rid

01:29:01.959 --> 01:29:05.327
of our stuck up,
useless friends.

01:29:05.329 --> 01:29:07.896
Our new ones
are a little strange,

01:29:07.898 --> 01:29:10.800
but they are true friends.

01:29:10.802 --> 01:29:15.404
I am so thankful that I married
the love of my life.

01:29:15.406 --> 01:29:20.743
And that I know my Frank and I
can overcome anything,

01:29:20.745 --> 01:29:22.347
as long as we are together.

01:29:23.181 --> 01:29:24.346
[mouths]
I love you.

01:29:24.348 --> 01:29:26.686
[Nancy] Rose, Rachel.

01:29:27.686 --> 01:29:30.686
Thank god for Baby Ruths.

01:29:30.688 --> 01:29:31.988
[all laughing]

01:29:31.990 --> 01:29:33.390
Okay, who's hungry?

01:29:33.392 --> 01:29:34.858
Me.

01:29:34.860 --> 01:29:36.027
For my new friend.

01:29:36.828 --> 01:29:39.194
