00:01.000 --> 00:02.545
Previously on Teen Wolf...

00:02.569 --> 00:03.679
There's four steps.

00:03.703 --> 00:06.015
We get into Eichen, we
get into the Closed Unit,

00:06.039 --> 00:07.282
get Lydia, get out.

00:07.306 --> 00:09.484
If we don't do this,

00:09.508 --> 00:11.008
she's going to die in there tonight.

00:11.778 --> 00:13.478
We're in. We did it.

00:14.747 --> 00:17.092
Stiles...

00:17.116 --> 00:18.626
You're going to die if you stay.

00:18.650 --> 00:22.497
Hello, this is Natalie Martin. I
need to see my daughter immediately.

00:22.521 --> 00:23.698
We're here for Lydia Martin.

00:23.722 --> 00:25.123
Lydia, I'm not leaving you here.

00:27.259 --> 00:28.603
I'm looking for a Hellhound.

00:28.627 --> 00:30.261
You wanted a Hellhound...

00:31.775 --> 00:33.308
I think you found one.

00:40.884 --> 00:42.527
Come on.

00:42.551 --> 00:44.676
We're getting Lydia out of here.

01:14.816 --> 01:16.316
Back off.

01:19.587 --> 01:21.087
I said back off.

01:24.992 --> 01:26.469
Take him.

01:26.493 --> 01:28.494
- The guy's on fire.
- You'll heal. Do it.

01:51.552 --> 01:53.052
Theo, this isn't working.

02:05.065 --> 02:07.973
Sorry Theo, but I'm not done with her yet.

03:01.553 --> 03:03.820
Hey! Lydia!

03:06.724 --> 03:08.224
Lydia!

03:09.027 --> 03:10.527
Lydia!

05:20.620 --> 05:22.921
- Don't go.
- I have to.

05:23.957 --> 05:25.701
Stay.

05:25.725 --> 05:28.161
Stay here? With you?

05:29.663 --> 05:31.163
Stay with us.

05:36.536 --> 05:38.871
Theo thinks he's gonna be
able to take its power.

05:40.073 --> 05:41.681
He's crazy.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.377
It's gonna rip his head off.

05:48.314 --> 05:50.292
But you think Scott can save everyone?

05:50.316 --> 05:51.816
I know he can.

05:54.653 --> 05:56.153
It's different now.

05:58.200 --> 06:02.737
I think dying did something to him.

06:02.761 --> 06:04.562
It did something to me, too.

06:05.698 --> 06:07.198
But none of it was good.

06:09.969 --> 06:11.569
What if it happened again?

06:13.706 --> 06:15.206
What if you got hurt?

06:17.309 --> 06:18.910
What would you want me to do?

06:20.012 --> 06:21.745
Now that you know everything.

06:40.865 --> 06:43.266
Starting to question
where your loyalties lie?

06:45.603 --> 06:48.238
Or maybe you're starting
to understand your role.

06:49.741 --> 06:51.318
What role?

06:51.342 --> 06:53.753
Why would Theo leave you here?

06:53.777 --> 06:55.945
Why not leave Josh or Corey?

06:57.814 --> 06:59.949
You're stronger and faster than both.

07:00.618 --> 07:02.118
And more fearless.

07:03.587 --> 07:05.288
I know why I'm stuck here with you.

07:07.291 --> 07:09.091
Because when it comes to Liam,

07:11.528 --> 07:13.006
I'm a liability.

07:13.030 --> 07:15.798
You could leave. You
could go off to help them.

07:16.700 --> 07:18.200
No one has to know.

07:19.102 --> 07:21.147
Except for you.

07:21.171 --> 07:22.805
Oh, I'm no friend to Theo.

07:24.374 --> 07:26.041
You want to help Liam?

07:27.377 --> 07:30.222
Worry less about being a liability

07:30.246 --> 07:33.782
and more about your ability to lie.

07:51.366 --> 07:54.780
Does anyone have eyes on the Closed
Unit? I need a status report.

07:54.804 --> 07:56.148
It's a war zone down here.

07:56.172 --> 07:58.784
Uh... 10-4.

07:58.808 --> 08:00.488
And what about the patients? Lydia Martin?

08:01.042 --> 08:02.643
Who is this?

08:04.012 --> 08:05.879
It's... Unit Nine.

08:08.505 --> 08:12.129
There is no Unit Nine. Who is this?

08:12.153 --> 08:13.678
How did you get...

08:16.224 --> 08:18.769
All right. We need to figure out another
way to get into this Closed Unit.

08:18.793 --> 08:21.371
- How do we get through the mountain ash?
- I don't know yet.

08:21.395 --> 08:23.795
But there's somebody else here
that might be able to help us.

08:24.065 --> 08:26.800
- Who?
- Meredith.

08:27.306 --> 08:29.669
Let me try.

08:33.941 --> 08:35.842
You're not gonna find her without me.

08:55.062 --> 08:56.139
I don't know how long I'm going to last.

08:56.163 --> 08:57.807
How did you stop it before?

08:57.831 --> 08:59.209
Scott carried me outside,
which almost killed him.

08:59.233 --> 09:00.710
Okay, uh...

09:00.734 --> 09:02.278
Maybe we could try
grounding you to something.

09:02.302 --> 09:03.679
You have a degree in
electrical engineering?

09:03.703 --> 09:05.103
'Cause I don't know how to do that.

09:08.275 --> 09:10.442
- You have to get out of here.
- I can't leave you.

09:13.780 --> 09:15.900
I should've stayed in the
desert with the Skinwalkers.

09:16.249 --> 09:17.793
I can't control this.

09:17.817 --> 09:19.962
I'm never going to be able to.

09:19.986 --> 09:21.397
Kira, it worked.

09:21.421 --> 09:22.497
You saw it work.

09:22.521 --> 09:24.867
You controlled it enough
to cause the brownout.

09:24.891 --> 09:26.424
You can stop it.

09:27.301 --> 09:29.164
I can't!

09:29.929 --> 09:31.429
Malia, go!

10:21.011 --> 10:22.511
Meredith?

10:24.849 --> 10:26.349
Meredith? It's Scott.

10:26.818 --> 10:28.318
Scott McCall.

10:55.747 --> 10:57.247
Stiles.

10:58.263 --> 10:59.976
I want her out of here, too.

11:00.458 --> 11:02.269
I've got her scent. What do you want?

11:02.293 --> 11:03.369
What's the difference?

11:03.393 --> 11:05.828
I can find her. You can't.

11:34.891 --> 11:36.858
It leads to the tunnels, doesn't it?

11:38.260 --> 11:39.760
There's miles of them.

11:41.831 --> 11:43.899
They could be anywhere by now.

11:46.102 --> 11:47.602
Hey. Meredith,

11:48.170 --> 11:49.670
can you hear me?

11:50.306 --> 11:51.884
We need your help.

11:51.908 --> 11:52.951
We're trying to find Lydia.

11:52.975 --> 11:54.475
We're trying to get her out of here.

11:55.478 --> 11:57.255
Scott, I think we better go.

11:57.279 --> 11:59.324
Meredith, listen.

11:59.348 --> 12:01.093
There has to be another
way to get to Lydia.

12:01.117 --> 12:02.827
We can't get past the mountain ash.

12:02.851 --> 12:04.351
How do we find her?

12:05.988 --> 12:07.488
Scott...

12:28.076 --> 12:29.576
I could hurt you.

12:36.317 --> 12:37.817
Okay.

13:07.914 --> 13:09.414
Kira?

13:13.253 --> 13:14.753
Kira.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.100
I wouldn't do that.

13:32.205 --> 13:34.565
Electricity's still coming off
her. I can feel it from here.

13:38.110 --> 13:40.556
- I can help her.
- Why?

13:40.580 --> 13:42.257
Because I need your help.

13:42.281 --> 13:43.781
With him.

14:05.637 --> 14:07.237
Meredith?

16:08.323 --> 16:10.335
Oh, sh...

16:18.532 --> 16:20.600
She doesn't have much time.

16:21.502 --> 16:23.079
What's happening to her?

16:23.103 --> 16:26.383
She's being consumed by her power.

16:26.407 --> 16:30.543
Dr. Valack thinks it's worth it
if she can answer the question.

16:31.245 --> 16:32.745
What question?

16:33.747 --> 16:35.247
Who is the Beast?

16:37.584 --> 16:39.229
She can answer that?

16:39.253 --> 16:41.364
Not yet.

16:41.388 --> 16:43.828
Not until the screams in her
head are loud enough to kill her.

16:45.759 --> 16:47.735
How do I get to her?

16:47.759 --> 16:48.938
You can't.

16:48.962 --> 16:52.207
You won't be able to get
past the mountain ash.

16:52.231 --> 16:55.133
But someone else might be able to.

16:55.468 --> 16:56.968
Who?

16:59.238 --> 17:00.738
The Hellhound.

17:01.274 --> 17:02.752
You mean Parrish?

17:02.776 --> 17:05.387
They're connected.

17:05.412 --> 17:07.521
Find the Hellhound,

17:07.546 --> 17:09.847
and he'll find the Banshee.

17:29.525 --> 17:31.603
Five texts in two minutes?

17:31.627 --> 17:33.856
Someone's trying to get your attention.

17:34.263 --> 17:35.740
Maybe you should go.

17:35.764 --> 17:38.209
I'm obviously not going anywhere.

17:38.233 --> 17:40.344
Could you please shut the hell up?

17:40.368 --> 17:44.983
I have a feeling you and I are
going to be friends, Hayden.

17:45.007 --> 17:48.875
I think we're going to discover a lot
of common ground beneath our feet.

17:56.251 --> 17:58.595
Now is that really necessary?

17:58.619 --> 18:00.119
It's Kanima Venom from Tracy.

18:02.457 --> 18:04.625
Enough to paralyze you for a couple hours.

18:07.294 --> 18:11.397
If we're going to be friends, Hayden,
you really need to learn to trust me.

18:22.642 --> 18:24.277
Now I trust you.

18:34.921 --> 18:36.421
Save her.

18:53.539 --> 18:55.039
Is he out?

18:57.231 --> 18:59.718
- Yeah.
- Okay.

19:03.849 --> 19:05.827
I thought you had her scent.

19:05.851 --> 19:07.563
I lost it.

19:07.587 --> 19:08.697
So find it again.

19:08.721 --> 19:10.332
What do you smell down here, Stiles?

19:10.356 --> 19:12.400
Chemicals and fecal matter.

19:12.424 --> 19:14.532
Although, I'm pretty sure
the fecal matter is you.

19:16.295 --> 19:17.772
I smell it, too.

19:17.796 --> 19:19.273
It's all that I can smell.

19:19.297 --> 19:20.308
Which is why I'm trying something else.

19:20.332 --> 19:22.010
So can you shut up and let me concentrate?

19:22.034 --> 19:24.746
I'm gonna find her.

19:24.770 --> 19:27.482
You know you won't, Stiles.
You're going to have to trust me.

19:27.506 --> 19:28.682
Trust you?

19:28.706 --> 19:30.718
The guy who murdered his
own sister when he was nine?

19:30.742 --> 19:33.053
Yeah, I was nine years old.

19:33.077 --> 19:35.623
I also believed a guy in a red suit

19:35.647 --> 19:37.691
came down the chimney to deliver presents.

19:37.715 --> 19:39.893
So when three people in
leather masks showed up

19:39.917 --> 19:41.662
and said that my sister
wanted me to have her heart,

19:41.686 --> 19:42.696
I believed them, too.

19:42.720 --> 19:44.832
So then together you gutted and killed her.

19:44.856 --> 19:46.299
That's a beautiful story.

19:46.323 --> 19:48.602
I watched her fall into the water
and freeze to death in minutes.

19:48.626 --> 19:50.671
Do you think I had any
idea what was going on?

19:50.695 --> 19:52.195
I think you pushed her.

19:52.730 --> 19:54.531
And I think you liked it.

20:03.440 --> 20:04.940
What direction was that?

20:05.809 --> 20:07.443
Where is it coming from?

20:08.812 --> 20:10.312
Everywhere.

20:28.965 --> 20:30.543
Just hold on a little longer, Lydia.

20:30.567 --> 20:32.935
You can make it.

20:46.148 --> 20:47.716
I want you to focus on this, Lydia.

20:48.984 --> 20:50.785
And what other sounds you hear now,

20:52.254 --> 20:53.755
push them aside.

20:54.957 --> 20:56.858
Focus on this sound.

21:12.807 --> 21:14.307
That's it.

21:16.010 --> 21:18.045
Focus on this sound and my voice.

21:20.949 --> 21:22.550
All right, Lydia?

21:30.825 --> 21:32.937
Don't worry, Lydia.

21:32.961 --> 21:35.528
Nurse Cross wasn't nearly
as strong as you are.

21:52.569 --> 21:55.014
Parrish? Parrish.

21:55.038 --> 21:57.331
Parrish. Parrish, hey. Can you hear me?

21:59.010 --> 22:00.487
How did I get here?

22:00.511 --> 22:03.023
We don't know. We just
followed the burning smell.

22:03.647 --> 22:05.591
Parrish, listen.

22:05.615 --> 22:08.261
Eichen's in lockdown.

22:08.285 --> 22:10.329
There's no way for us to
get out unless Plan B works.

22:10.353 --> 22:13.804
Plan B? What's Plan B?

22:14.425 --> 22:15.902
Don't worry about it.

22:15.926 --> 22:17.937
Right now, we need you to find Lydia.

22:17.961 --> 22:20.507
Me? LIAM: Actually, not completely you.

22:21.030 --> 22:23.676
We kind of need the other you.

22:23.700 --> 22:25.300
The Hellhound.

22:31.441 --> 22:32.918
Why isn't he healing?

22:32.942 --> 22:35.300
Maybe he can't. Maybe it's too much.

22:36.278 --> 22:37.778
Or maybe it's the pain.

22:38.881 --> 22:39.991
He's going to die, isn't he?

22:40.015 --> 22:41.726
His heartbeat's getting slower.

22:41.750 --> 22:43.384
What do we do?

22:44.119 --> 22:45.596
You can't heal him, can you?

22:45.620 --> 22:48.934
No, but I can take his pain.

22:48.958 --> 22:50.869
It could help. It might even
get him to start healing.

22:50.893 --> 22:52.793
- Then do it.
- You first.

22:55.630 --> 22:57.107
You said you could help her.

22:57.131 --> 22:59.410
Yeah, but it's not like taking
voltage from a car battery.

22:59.434 --> 23:00.914
She's got a lot more power than that.

23:01.936 --> 23:03.314
Are you going to do something or not?

23:03.338 --> 23:05.015
When you help her. I don't trust you.

23:05.039 --> 23:06.656
I don't trust you either.

23:07.843 --> 23:10.426
All right. We go at the same time.

23:24.926 --> 23:26.426
You ready?

23:33.634 --> 23:35.401
All right, here we go.

24:05.432 --> 24:06.909
Nothing.

24:06.933 --> 24:08.677
Great. You're just as useless as I am.

24:08.701 --> 24:10.513
I'm trying to help save her life.

24:10.537 --> 24:13.048
Would you just drop the altruistic crap?

24:13.072 --> 24:14.850
You want Lydia because
she gets you to Parrish,

24:14.874 --> 24:16.952
you want Parrish 'cause
he gets you to the Beast.

24:16.976 --> 24:18.586
So what? I want it dead, too.

24:18.610 --> 24:20.378
After you take its power, right?

24:21.713 --> 24:23.588
We know why you got the talons

24:24.216 --> 24:25.693
and we know you're looking for Deucalion.

24:25.717 --> 24:27.217
I found Deucalion.

24:28.120 --> 24:29.831
You're right.

24:29.855 --> 24:32.000
I'm going to help Parrish stop the Beast.

24:32.024 --> 24:33.367
I'm going to take its power.

24:33.391 --> 24:35.503
And then I'm going to break its neck.

24:35.527 --> 24:36.871
So maybe I'm not the good guy in your eyes,

24:36.895 --> 24:39.717
but I might end up being the
guy that saves all your asses.

24:44.002 --> 24:45.502
Break it.

24:47.673 --> 24:49.150
What?

24:49.174 --> 24:50.941
The sound travels through the pipe.

24:51.977 --> 24:54.310
You'll hear better, dumb-ass. Break it.

25:01.987 --> 25:03.487
Lydia?

25:04.022 --> 25:05.522
Can you hear me?

25:08.693 --> 25:10.737
What do you want from me?

25:10.761 --> 25:12.996
I want your help against the Dread Doctors.

25:18.569 --> 25:20.111
They ruined me.

25:20.671 --> 25:22.209
Destroyed me.

25:23.107 --> 25:24.951
They drove me to obsession,

25:24.975 --> 25:28.214
consigned me to professional ridicule.

25:30.481 --> 25:32.081
People thought I was a monster

25:34.651 --> 25:36.885
when I was simply
trying to open their eyes.

25:41.892 --> 25:44.059
Now you want me to be your eyes.

25:45.028 --> 25:47.183
You'll see things, Lydia.

25:48.632 --> 25:51.103
Things no one else can see.

25:53.937 --> 25:55.870
You may not survive,

25:59.075 --> 26:01.566
but you might save the
lives of your friends.

26:29.237 --> 26:30.737
Do it!

26:42.047 --> 26:44.382
We have to slow your mind first.

26:44.772 --> 26:46.950
There's too much activity in your brain.

26:46.974 --> 26:49.275
We have to get from a
gamma wave to a theta.

26:51.245 --> 26:53.223
It's too loud. I can't.

26:53.247 --> 26:55.248
If I try the mask now it will kill you.

26:56.316 --> 26:58.017
You have to calm your mind.

27:02.789 --> 27:04.811
You understand what they've created.

27:07.627 --> 27:09.104
The Beast.

27:09.128 --> 27:10.973
The Beast of Gevaudan.

27:10.997 --> 27:12.731
An engineered version of it.

27:14.267 --> 27:16.145
But it's not yet fully grown.

27:16.169 --> 27:18.113
It's still bound to its host,

27:18.137 --> 27:19.949
the teenage Chimera inside.

27:19.973 --> 27:22.908
And it still requires the
Dread Doctors' protection.

27:25.344 --> 27:27.845
- Damnatio Memoriae.
- That's right.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.292
The Beast was a man first.

27:31.316 --> 27:34.696
A human killer in the late 1700s.

27:34.720 --> 27:37.098
The Dread Doctors are trying
to get it to remember itself.

27:37.122 --> 27:38.667
To remember the man.

27:38.691 --> 27:42.326
When that happens, the teenager is gone.

27:48.666 --> 27:50.378
Anybody know how we're
supposed to get out of here?

27:50.402 --> 27:52.169
This place is still in lockdown.

27:54.106 --> 27:57.385
- It's not just locked.
- Yeah, I can feel it, too.

27:57.409 --> 27:59.320
What are we supposed to do? Just wait here?

27:59.344 --> 28:00.488
There's a Plan B.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.290
We've got a guy on the
outside in case this happens.

28:02.314 --> 28:04.681
- Who?
- Mason.

28:05.483 --> 28:07.628
Mason's going to unlock the lockdown?

28:07.652 --> 28:08.729
How's he going to do that?

28:08.753 --> 28:09.964
He's got the blueprints of the building.

28:09.988 --> 28:12.299
And he has the full map of
Eichen's electrical system.

28:12.323 --> 28:15.084
All he has to do is get into the
transformer shed behind the building.

28:17.294 --> 28:20.373
Don't worry. Mason knows
exactly what he's doing.

28:20.397 --> 28:24.944
Liam, call me back, I
have no idea what to do.

28:24.968 --> 28:26.012
And I'm panicking.

28:26.036 --> 28:28.748
I'm completely and totally panicking.

28:28.772 --> 28:30.683
I drove around this
building, like, four times

28:30.707 --> 28:32.285
and I can't find this transformer shed.

28:32.309 --> 28:33.686
Well, actually, that's partially right.

28:33.710 --> 28:35.255
Because I found where the
transformer shed is supposed to be.

28:35.279 --> 28:37.189
But it's not a shed anymore.

28:37.213 --> 28:40.793
It's a wall. Like, a very big wall.

28:40.817 --> 28:42.862
So, I mean, I tried calling Hayden.

28:42.886 --> 28:45.732
And she still isn't here,
and I heard alarms go off.

28:45.756 --> 28:47.033
Now I don't know what to do.

28:47.057 --> 28:49.424
So, Liam, just call me.

29:02.805 --> 29:06.040
This teenager, Lydia, is
the last Genetic Chimera.

29:07.043 --> 29:08.787
A young man or a young woman,

29:08.811 --> 29:10.902
maybe even someone you know.

29:12.048 --> 29:14.793
A success where Theo and
the others were failures.

29:14.817 --> 29:17.162
But we went through the
list of Genetic Chimeras.

29:17.186 --> 29:18.830
There's no one else.

29:18.854 --> 29:20.899
There must be one you missed.

29:20.923 --> 29:24.136
Another way they could
have two sets of DNA.

29:24.160 --> 29:26.337
If you could see the face of this teenager,

29:26.361 --> 29:28.005
discover its identity,

29:28.029 --> 29:29.869
then your friends would
have a fighting chance.

29:32.167 --> 29:33.901
The mask can help you see.

29:37.072 --> 29:38.572
Lydia!

29:44.946 --> 29:46.991
Lydia!

29:47.015 --> 29:49.296
- What the hell are you doing? Get the door.
- I'm trying.

29:53.521 --> 29:54.922
I'm sorry. But time's up.

30:35.462 --> 30:37.596
You came back.

30:38.531 --> 30:40.209
We're getting you out of here, okay?

30:40.233 --> 30:41.977
You can't. It's too dangerous.

30:42.001 --> 30:44.603
Lydia, please shut up and
let me save your life.

31:06.958 --> 31:08.993
Okay, here we go.

31:10.997 --> 31:12.474
Gonna ram the wall.

31:12.498 --> 31:14.532
Gonna ram it with my car.

31:15.200 --> 31:17.145
Just smash through it.

31:17.169 --> 31:19.447
Take out the power. And save my friends.

31:19.471 --> 31:20.548
Here we go.

31:20.572 --> 31:23.617
All right. Just ram it

31:23.641 --> 31:28.156
and destroy my beautiful car that
my parents bought me on my birthday,

31:28.180 --> 31:29.680
but I'ma save my friends.

31:30.182 --> 31:31.858
Here we go.

31:31.882 --> 31:33.517
Ram the wall. All right.

31:37.989 --> 31:40.133
What the hell are you doing?

31:40.157 --> 31:42.303
Oh, thank God.

31:42.327 --> 31:44.605
- Can we use your car?
- Are you kidding?

31:44.629 --> 31:46.340
A car is not getting through that.

31:46.364 --> 31:47.918
What? You have any better ideas?

31:57.208 --> 31:58.708
Hayden?

32:04.181 --> 32:05.681
Hayden.

32:10.454 --> 32:11.954
Hayden.

32:17.994 --> 32:19.714
Wait. Whoa. Wait, Hayden. Whoa, whoa, wait!

32:27.372 --> 32:29.048
I'm in!

32:29.072 --> 32:30.572
Okay. Um...

32:31.975 --> 32:34.353
Okay. There's two red levers.

32:34.377 --> 32:36.588
You're going to pull
them both. You see them?

32:36.612 --> 32:38.324
I see 10.

32:38.348 --> 32:41.493
- Two.
- No. 10.

32:41.517 --> 32:43.662
There's ten red levers.

32:43.686 --> 32:45.263
What do I do?

32:45.287 --> 32:46.698
Mason?

32:46.722 --> 32:48.523
Mason, what am I supposed to do?

33:08.771 --> 33:10.271
Parrish?

33:11.501 --> 33:13.341
How's he going to get
through the mountain ash?

33:34.556 --> 33:36.116
He's burning it right out of the walls.

33:38.060 --> 33:39.637
Okay. You gotta try and stay on your feet.

33:39.661 --> 33:41.539
The plan didn't work out too well.

33:41.563 --> 33:42.574
So I'm gonna need your help, okay?

33:42.598 --> 33:44.041
You had a plan?

33:44.065 --> 33:46.043
Yeah. It was good on paper.

33:46.067 --> 33:47.567
Not too much in reality.

33:50.606 --> 33:52.106
I can't hold it.

33:56.344 --> 33:57.388
Lydia...

33:57.412 --> 33:59.513
Stiles, run!

34:37.885 --> 34:39.561
Where to?

34:39.585 --> 34:41.719
This way. Come on.

34:44.757 --> 34:46.467
Hayden, just pull them all.

34:46.492 --> 34:48.404
Just pull them all!

34:48.428 --> 34:50.371
- There's a gate up ahead.
- What about Mason?

34:50.396 --> 34:51.896
He's on it. Trust me.

34:59.104 --> 35:00.582
What's... What's happening?

35:00.606 --> 35:02.106
Plan B.

35:03.042 --> 35:05.143
Liam, slow down. Liam, wait!

35:16.754 --> 35:18.655
I told you.

35:26.364 --> 35:28.049
He did it.

35:28.499 --> 35:30.100
We gotta get to Stiles' Jeep.

35:35.539 --> 35:37.039
Can you stand?

35:43.180 --> 35:44.657
Is she okay?

35:44.681 --> 35:46.493
No, we need to go. Give me the keys.

35:46.517 --> 35:47.757
We gotta get her to the clinic.

35:52.055 --> 35:53.666
Sorry, but she's coming with me.

35:53.690 --> 35:56.035
Okay. Tracy, just wait. You don't
know what's about to happen.

35:56.059 --> 35:57.604
I'm taking her. That's what's happening.

35:57.628 --> 35:59.462
And none of are you going to do a thing...

36:05.068 --> 36:08.602
Could somebody please get my
daughter out of this hellhole?

36:15.345 --> 36:17.689
- Scott.
- Yeah. I'm trying, I'm trying.

36:17.713 --> 36:19.581
We're almost there.
Lydia, just hold on, okay?

36:28.091 --> 36:29.568
Hey.

36:29.592 --> 36:31.737
Lydia, Lydia, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

36:31.761 --> 36:32.738
Look. You're gonna get through this, okay?

36:32.762 --> 36:34.462
Lydia, look at me, you're gonna make it.

36:43.806 --> 36:46.068
But you're not.

37:02.791 --> 37:04.358
Get her on the table.

37:10.665 --> 37:12.766
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hold her.

37:19.307 --> 37:21.518
- Doc, think you gotta do something.
- I will.

37:21.542 --> 37:24.143
But right now, I need
you to keep her still.

37:27.881 --> 37:29.381
Steady.

37:29.817 --> 37:32.196
- Steady.
- What the hell is that?

37:32.220 --> 37:33.664
Mistletoe.

37:33.688 --> 37:35.299
Mistletoe? She's got a
fricking hole in her head.

37:35.323 --> 37:36.823
Stiles, help.

37:39.292 --> 37:40.792
Steady.

38:07.354 --> 38:09.098
Lydia.

38:09.122 --> 38:10.622
Lydia?

38:13.525 --> 38:15.025
Lydia.

38:15.928 --> 38:17.428
Lydia, come on.

38:20.599 --> 38:23.278
No, no, no, no, no.
Come on, Lydia. Wake up.

38:23.302 --> 38:25.180
Come on.

38:25.204 --> 38:27.415
Wake up. Can you hear me? Lydia.

38:27.439 --> 38:30.719
Lydia, open your eyes. Come on, come on.

38:30.743 --> 38:32.854
Come on. Listen to me, Lydia.

38:32.878 --> 38:34.379
Hey, show me your eyes, okay?

38:36.782 --> 38:38.773
Lydia, you have to open your eyes.

39:12.450 --> 39:13.950
You okay?

39:16.487 --> 39:17.987
You're okay.

39:23.493 --> 39:24.993
Want to try to sit up?

39:44.414 --> 39:45.914
Mom?

39:47.551 --> 39:49.051
Oh, honey.

39:56.625 --> 39:58.360
They saved my life, Mom.

40:02.565 --> 40:04.632
Stiles saved me.

40:22.385 --> 40:23.918
I'm not paying for the windows.

40:30.125 --> 40:32.370
I said it was for emergencies only.

40:32.394 --> 40:34.105
I had an emergency.

40:34.129 --> 40:35.306
Don't worry, Theo.

40:35.330 --> 40:38.065
A little dissension in the
ranks is perfectly healthy.

40:39.434 --> 40:41.167
Did you find what you were looking for?

40:43.638 --> 40:45.138
No.

40:47.509 --> 40:49.389
But I think I might have
found something better.

40:52.414 --> 40:53.914
A way to answer the question.

40:54.572 --> 40:56.439
Who is the Beast?
