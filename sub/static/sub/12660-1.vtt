04:48.920 --> 04:51.850
Here for the next month.

04:51.850 --> 04:55.290
It's weird looking.

04:55.290 --> 04:56.720
It's kind of weird.

04:59.990 --> 05:00.890
Rocking boat.

05:00.900 --> 05:01.900
God.

05:04.670 --> 05:05.670
You have suitcases?

05:10.370 --> 05:11.370
Thanks.

05:19.150 --> 05:20.710
Could it be any hotter?

05:20.720 --> 05:23.680
Ugh, it's gross.

05:23.690 --> 05:25.650
I just got bit already.

05:25.650 --> 05:27.290
So this is Thailand.

05:27.290 --> 05:30.960
It looks amazing.

05:30.960 --> 05:32.930
We're really out in the
sticks here, aren't we?

05:32.930 --> 05:37.230
This is gonna be an
unforgettable experience.

05:37.230 --> 05:41.900
Yeah, well, after a train ride
to a cab ride to a boat ride,

05:41.900 --> 05:44.070
that was quite an
experience in itself.

05:44.070 --> 05:45.640
Don't be such a sourpuss.

05:45.640 --> 05:47.740
Come on, this place is huge.

05:47.740 --> 05:50.640
Yeah, but the words freaky
and run down come to mind.

05:50.650 --> 05:53.350
You know what, I'm just
relieved it's not a hut, OK?

05:53.350 --> 05:54.680
Why would it be a hut?

05:54.680 --> 05:59.820
It's Southeast Asia,
teaching children.

05:59.820 --> 06:00.920
I expected a hut.

06:00.920 --> 06:02.720
This isn't much better.

06:02.720 --> 06:03.420
Come on, sis.

06:03.430 --> 06:04.320
We're in Thailand.

06:04.330 --> 06:05.960
We're saving the world.

06:05.960 --> 06:07.690
Enjoy it.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.800
All right, how about we just
go inside like normal people

06:09.800 --> 06:11.030
would do?

06:11.030 --> 06:13.070
OK, we're teaching small
children the alphabet.

06:13.070 --> 06:14.130
We're not curing cancer.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.020
Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

06:23.740 --> 06:25.950
Jeez.

06:25.950 --> 06:26.950
What were you doing?

06:26.950 --> 06:28.280
Nothing.

06:28.280 --> 06:30.880
Just admiring that cool
dollhouse looking thing.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.290
It's actually called
a spirit house,

06:32.290 --> 06:33.950
and it's sacred in Thai culture.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.320
How am I supposed to know that?

06:35.320 --> 06:38.260
What's that supposed to mean?

06:38.260 --> 06:40.990
Ah, Alex, ignorance
truly is bliss.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.960
Wow, I'm so glad I'm
not related to you two.

06:42.960 --> 06:43.860
Wait.

06:43.870 --> 06:44.870
I don't get it.

06:50.300 --> 06:51.740
OK.

06:51.740 --> 06:53.070
Oh, come on.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.770
What are you doing?

06:54.780 --> 06:55.980
Stuck.

06:55.980 --> 06:57.310
Probably because
it's a piece of crap.

06:57.310 --> 06:58.810
Come on, let me see.

07:05.150 --> 07:06.150
Uh.

07:06.150 --> 07:07.290
Oh!

07:07.290 --> 07:09.060
What do you know?

07:09.060 --> 07:11.760
Not so ignorant after all, huh?

07:11.760 --> 07:14.090
I swear, I'm gonna smack her
at some point this summer.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.230
Well, wait until she's drunk
so it doesn't hurt as bad.

07:16.230 --> 07:17.430
Love you Al, I swear.

07:22.470 --> 07:23.470
OK.

07:25.940 --> 07:26.940
Ugh.

07:31.010 --> 07:34.850
Hey, don't judge a book
by its cover, right?

07:34.850 --> 07:37.250
It's not completely unfortunate.

07:37.250 --> 07:41.190
Wow, it's so old.

07:41.190 --> 07:42.120
How old do you think?

07:42.120 --> 07:43.360
Like, thousands of years?

07:43.360 --> 07:44.390
I don't know.

07:44.390 --> 07:45.290
See?

07:45.290 --> 07:48.430
I told you it's amazing.

07:48.430 --> 07:51.260
Just like the woman at
the housing office said.

07:51.270 --> 07:53.270
I call dibs on the biggest room!

07:53.270 --> 07:54.270
Noted.

07:54.270 --> 07:58.340
Well, it only is fair, since
I never doubted the place.

07:58.340 --> 08:00.770
Like I said, it's
not completely shitty.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.240
You said unfortunate.

08:02.240 --> 08:04.180
But I meant shitty.

08:04.180 --> 08:06.510
OK, girls, do you want to
see the rest of the rooms?

08:11.290 --> 08:13.850
I'm just going to remind
you guys that I called dibs.

08:13.860 --> 08:16.920
I don't remember
that conversation.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.260
Jules, do you remember anything
about a dibs being called?

08:19.260 --> 08:20.260
Ah, uh-uh.

08:20.260 --> 08:21.930
No.

08:21.930 --> 08:24.960
You know, I... I don't
remember anything about that.

08:24.970 --> 08:26.050
You guys are hilarious.

08:27.370 --> 08:28.370
Sorry.

08:36.909 --> 08:39.280
I don't know if we're
supposed to be up here.

08:39.280 --> 08:40.280
I'm sure it's fine.

08:51.560 --> 08:52.560
Ooh.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.910
Guys, look at this.

09:05.910 --> 09:08.040
Looks like traditional
Thai couch or something.

09:08.040 --> 09:09.040
Comfy.

09:21.220 --> 09:22.220
Whoa.

09:28.500 --> 09:29.540
It looks really old.

09:35.540 --> 09:37.440
Is that gold?

09:37.440 --> 09:38.610
No way.

09:38.610 --> 09:40.310
It's probably paint.

09:40.310 --> 09:42.180
Look, it's chipping right there.

09:42.180 --> 09:43.640
It's so cold.

09:49.550 --> 09:51.990
It's really pretty.

09:51.990 --> 09:54.350
Well, if it's an antique, you
shouldn't be touching it, Al.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.920
You're right.

09:56.930 --> 09:57.930
Really?

10:01.630 --> 10:04.630
Uh, OK, I'm a little bit
creeped out by this, so let's

10:04.630 --> 10:08.200
I don't want to be responsible
for breaking an ancient statue,

10:08.200 --> 10:09.340
OK?

10:09.340 --> 10:11.670
All right, girls,
what's the plan?

10:11.670 --> 10:15.110
Now, we can go get food, go
to town, get tequila shots.

10:15.110 --> 10:16.980
What?

10:16.980 --> 10:17.610
Sleep.

10:17.610 --> 10:18.910
OK.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.210
Sleep it is.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.220
Come on.

10:30.390 --> 10:31.960
Oh, hey, baby.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.330
Nice shirt.

10:33.330 --> 10:34.230
What are you up to?

10:34.230 --> 10:36.060
Just waking up.

10:36.060 --> 10:39.370
Checking in on my little lover.

10:39.370 --> 10:40.700
What time is it over there?

10:40.700 --> 10:42.170
Noon.

10:42.170 --> 10:43.700
Oh.

10:43.710 --> 10:46.570
I see you're putting your
summer TAing off to good use.

10:46.570 --> 10:48.980
Well, you know, the whole
reason I'm becoming a professor

10:48.980 --> 10:51.240
is so I can have the summers
off, not have to wake

10:51.250 --> 10:52.510
up at the crack of dawn.

10:55.450 --> 10:57.320
I remember somebody
telling me Thailand

10:57.320 --> 11:02.020
is an amazing and magical land.

11:02.020 --> 11:03.160
So how are the sisters?

11:03.160 --> 11:04.160
Crazy and crazier?

12:45.360 --> 12:46.260
Hey guys.

12:46.260 --> 12:47.390
What's for breakfast?

12:47.400 --> 12:48.400
I'm starving.

12:50.660 --> 12:52.500
What?

12:52.500 --> 12:54.270
There's no food in this house.

12:54.270 --> 12:55.370
Yep.

12:55.370 --> 12:58.340
All we could find was this tea.

12:58.340 --> 12:59.240
Hmm.

12:59.240 --> 13:00.170
All right, then.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.300
Who wants to go to town?

13:09.180 --> 13:10.420
What the heck?

13:10.420 --> 13:11.780
It's probably just the wind.

13:44.550 --> 13:47.150
Sir?

13:47.160 --> 13:48.390
Sir?

13:48.390 --> 13:50.260
Are you OK?

13:50.260 --> 13:53.130
He looks comatose.

13:53.130 --> 13:55.600
Except he's standing.

14:04.270 --> 14:05.340
Uh, hold on.

14:05.340 --> 14:06.810
We don't speak Thai.

14:06.810 --> 14:07.710
Oh.

14:07.710 --> 14:09.140
Um.

14:09.140 --> 14:10.380
Well, sorry to bother you.

14:10.380 --> 14:12.280
Many apologies.

14:12.280 --> 14:14.580
Is he OK?

14:14.580 --> 14:16.680
Yeah.

14:16.680 --> 14:19.390
He just likes to
wander off sometimes.

14:19.390 --> 14:20.150
Again, very sorry.

14:20.160 --> 14:21.250
Thank you.

14:27.160 --> 14:29.760
Well, that was creepy.

14:29.760 --> 14:32.430
But I'm hungry, so let's go.

14:32.430 --> 14:35.540
Wow, someone's good
at compartmentalizing.

14:35.540 --> 14:36.770
You have no idea.

14:45.680 --> 14:47.650
Ooh, let's stop here for a sec.

14:47.650 --> 14:50.620
I want to look at something.

14:52.820 --> 14:53.790
Hmm.

14:53.790 --> 14:54.790
Purses.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.800
You don't even wear jewelry.

15:03.800 --> 15:05.460
When in Rome.

15:05.470 --> 15:06.530
Is this a dragon?

15:06.530 --> 15:10.540
Oh, um, hello.

15:10.540 --> 15:15.810
How much does this cost?

15:15.810 --> 15:18.240
90 baht.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.410
It's about $3.00 American.

15:19.410 --> 15:20.310
What?

15:20.320 --> 15:21.550
OK.

15:21.550 --> 15:25.920
Um, Al, what do you
think of this bag?

15:25.920 --> 15:28.390
Um, yeah, that bag...
That bag's cool, I think.

15:28.390 --> 15:29.760
I guess.

15:29.760 --> 15:30.660
OK.

15:30.660 --> 15:31.890
I'll buy it.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.960
So, girls, what's the
plan for tonight, huh?

15:37.970 --> 15:41.230
I mean, we only have a week
before the work starts.

15:41.240 --> 15:42.000
Thank you.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.540
And by the work,
you mean helping

15:44.540 --> 15:46.970
lovely, helpless little
children and the joy

15:46.980 --> 15:48.840
that comes with that, right?

15:48.840 --> 15:50.340
Yes, that is
exactly what I meant.

15:50.350 --> 15:51.240
Mmhmm.

15:51.250 --> 15:52.580
Yes.

15:52.580 --> 15:53.580
What about you, Al?

15:53.580 --> 15:54.650
Um, what?

15:54.650 --> 15:56.350
The club.

15:56.350 --> 15:59.650
I think those guys
are following us.

15:59.650 --> 16:01.950
That's a weird subject change.

16:01.960 --> 16:02.860
No, seriously.

16:02.860 --> 16:06.530
I saw them when you
were buying your purse.

16:06.530 --> 16:08.690
Hey, you guys want
something or what?

16:14.840 --> 16:15.870
Yeah, right?

16:15.870 --> 16:16.800
Oh, come on, Al.

16:16.800 --> 16:17.700
Don't worry.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.640
I'm sure they're harmless.

16:19.640 --> 16:20.810
Whatever.

16:20.810 --> 16:24.410
OK, so, um, change, thank you?

16:24.410 --> 16:26.450
So, what's the vote?

16:26.450 --> 16:27.710
Thank you.

16:27.720 --> 16:28.610
Vote, vote?

16:28.620 --> 16:29.580
Yeah, club sounds fun.

16:29.580 --> 16:30.480
Tonight?

16:30.490 --> 16:31.920
OK.

16:31.920 --> 16:34.890
Yeah, we'll dance,
drink, make bad decisions.

16:34.890 --> 16:36.420
It'll be like a Tuesday for you.

16:36.420 --> 16:37.920
Oh, hilarious.

16:37.930 --> 16:40.530
OK, I'm in, too, but
just as an observer,

16:40.530 --> 16:42.660
because I have a boyfriend.

16:42.660 --> 16:44.360
Well, all the more
reason to drink.

16:44.370 --> 16:45.060
Uh-huh.

16:45.070 --> 16:46.070
Lame.

17:24.069 --> 17:26.940
I seriously think Shane
might propose soon.

17:26.940 --> 17:27.839
Eew.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.840
That sounds awful.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.980
No, it's... it's a good thing.

17:31.980 --> 17:34.010
Would you actually say yes?

17:34.020 --> 17:37.680
We've been together four
years, so, you know.

17:37.690 --> 17:38.880
Jeez.

17:38.890 --> 17:40.820
I think my longest
relationship was...

17:40.820 --> 17:44.590
Does five weeks even count?

17:44.590 --> 17:45.830
You guys ready
for another round?

17:45.830 --> 17:47.460
Yeah.

17:47.460 --> 17:48.860
Oh, we should get that big,
um, that fishbowl thing

17:48.860 --> 17:50.060
with, like, the giant straws.

17:50.060 --> 17:52.400
Yes!

17:52.400 --> 17:54.770
That sounds like a
hangover in a bucket.

17:54.770 --> 17:56.940
That sounds like
a bucket of fun.

17:56.940 --> 18:01.440
A bucket of fun?

18:01.440 --> 18:02.440
Fine, fishbowl.

18:06.610 --> 18:09.520
It sounds amazing, and
you're gonna love it.

18:15.960 --> 18:17.960
Can we drink all that?

18:17.960 --> 18:19.430
Of course.

18:19.430 --> 18:21.160
You gonna let me
buy you a drink?

18:21.160 --> 18:23.860
Oh, hello.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.500
No, thank you, actually.

18:25.500 --> 18:27.830
My girlfriends and I are
gonna do a fishbowl thing, so.

18:27.840 --> 18:28.730
Hey, hey, please.

18:28.740 --> 18:31.440
Let Colin take care of it.

18:31.440 --> 18:32.510
Really not a problem.

18:32.510 --> 18:33.910
Oh.

18:33.910 --> 18:36.140
Did he just refer to
himself in the third person?

18:36.140 --> 18:39.180
OK, Colin, I'm sorry, but
I'm just not interested.

18:39.180 --> 18:41.510
I might be interested.

18:41.520 --> 18:42.620
Rachel.

18:42.620 --> 18:43.580
Where are you guys from?

18:43.580 --> 18:44.480
America, right?

18:44.490 --> 18:45.420
Yes.

18:45.420 --> 18:46.120
Mm-hm.

18:46.120 --> 18:47.820
I fucking knew it.

18:47.820 --> 18:50.020
What is it, go the Lakers, yeah?

18:50.020 --> 18:52.930
Yes, I'm American
and I love the Lakers.

18:52.930 --> 18:54.190
You're from Michigan.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.860
Same thing.

18:55.860 --> 18:57.960
What... what are
you, like, British?

18:57.970 --> 19:00.900
Yeah, I'm London born and bred.

19:00.900 --> 19:02.740
Gonna let me buy
you a drink or not?

19:02.740 --> 19:03.570
No.

19:03.570 --> 19:04.690
I'm just not interested.

19:08.510 --> 19:09.710
Still there?

19:09.710 --> 19:10.980
Knock knock.

19:10.980 --> 19:12.450
Who's there?

19:12.450 --> 19:14.180
The guy you just made
a dickhead out of.

19:14.180 --> 19:15.080
Thanks for that.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.080
Much appreciated.

19:17.650 --> 19:19.890
Wow.

19:19.890 --> 19:22.660
You're welcome!

19:22.660 --> 19:24.560
Honestly, who was that?

19:29.530 --> 19:31.130
Rachel, do you see his friends?

19:34.600 --> 19:36.170
Yeah, they're super cute.

19:40.170 --> 19:41.570
I like the mature gentleman.

19:41.580 --> 19:44.210
No, those are the guys that
were following us earlier.

19:44.210 --> 19:45.210
What?

19:47.210 --> 19:48.110
Oh my gosh.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.250
You guys are so bad.

19:49.250 --> 19:50.880
It's dark in here.

19:50.890 --> 19:51.980
It's hard to see.

19:51.990 --> 19:53.720
Alex, are you sure that's them?

19:53.720 --> 19:55.860
I'm positive.

19:55.860 --> 19:57.860
Yes, it's definitely them!

19:57.860 --> 19:59.120
I'm going there.

19:59.130 --> 20:00.590
I'm going to go talk to them.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.930
Rachel, no, no, no!

20:02.930 --> 20:03.930
Rach!

20:03.930 --> 20:04.830
Oh, Rachel.

20:04.830 --> 20:05.830
Oh, God.

20:10.600 --> 20:11.600
Some girl's coming.

20:15.240 --> 20:16.910
Hello.

20:16.910 --> 20:17.910
Hi.

20:17.910 --> 20:20.110
You guys following us?

20:20.110 --> 20:21.110
Rachel.

20:24.820 --> 20:25.950
Give me some of that.

20:25.950 --> 20:26.850
Definitely not.

20:26.850 --> 20:27.950
Don't believe you, but OK.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.190
Are you a model?

20:30.190 --> 20:31.260
I could be.

20:31.260 --> 20:32.260
BRB.

20:34.590 --> 20:35.790
Grab yourself.

20:35.800 --> 20:36.730
We're moving spots.

20:36.730 --> 20:38.030
Oh, good, we're leaving.

20:38.030 --> 20:40.000
No, like we are joining them.

20:40.000 --> 20:40.900
No.

20:40.900 --> 20:41.300
What?

20:41.300 --> 20:42.840
Yes.

20:42.840 --> 20:46.610
They're nice and they're
cute and they're male.

20:46.610 --> 20:48.170
Did I mention that
they were male?

20:48.180 --> 20:50.980
Do I need to remind you that
these cute, nice guys were also

20:50.980 --> 20:52.880
stalking us about,
like, six hours ago?

20:52.880 --> 20:53.980
Rach, are you sure about this?

20:53.980 --> 20:54.880
Come on.

20:54.880 --> 20:56.150
Yes, I'm sure.

20:56.150 --> 20:57.850
They just thought
that we were models.

20:57.850 --> 20:59.750
Oh.

20:59.750 --> 21:02.920
I don't care what they
think that we look like, OK?

21:02.920 --> 21:05.690
I have a boyfriend.

21:05.690 --> 21:06.990
Eew, god, look at them.

21:06.990 --> 21:09.730
They won't stop staring at us.

21:09.730 --> 21:10.630
They're not creepy.

21:10.630 --> 21:11.930
They're British.

21:11.930 --> 21:14.330
And that means that
they are intelligent.

21:14.340 --> 21:15.830
Mm-hm.

21:15.840 --> 21:17.100
Yes.

21:17.100 --> 21:18.970
And besides that, you
guys are not going

21:18.970 --> 21:20.670
to be ruining this for me.

21:20.680 --> 21:24.610
Do you know how long it's
been since I've gotten laid?

21:24.610 --> 21:25.740
Yeah.

21:25.750 --> 21:28.350
A really long time, OK?

21:28.350 --> 21:29.920
So you have to take
one for the team here.

21:29.920 --> 21:30.750
Come on, Jules.

21:30.750 --> 21:32.050
Please?

21:32.050 --> 21:33.020
No, I'm not.

21:33.020 --> 21:34.250
I'm not going over there.

21:34.260 --> 21:35.990
God, no.

21:35.990 --> 21:38.060
I'll stay in my fishbowl.

21:38.060 --> 21:42.290
I didn't want to have
to do this, but Vegas.

21:42.300 --> 21:45.600
2010.

21:47.940 --> 21:50.270
There was a swimming pool.

21:50.270 --> 21:54.370
And there was an emergency room.

21:54.380 --> 21:55.340
That's what I thought.

21:55.340 --> 21:56.710
Oh my God.

21:56.710 --> 21:59.080
I saved your ass.

21:59.080 --> 22:00.810
You owe me.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.720
You fucking owe me.

22:02.720 --> 22:03.620
Fine.

22:03.620 --> 22:04.950
Fine, OK?

22:04.950 --> 22:05.950
But then this is over.

22:05.950 --> 22:07.020
We are even. You hear me?

22:07.020 --> 22:07.920
We're even!

22:07.920 --> 22:08.650
Even!

22:08.660 --> 22:10.390
Even Steven.

22:10.390 --> 22:12.060
Yes.

22:12.060 --> 22:14.360
All right.

22:14.360 --> 22:16.400
Got the bowl.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.400
Yes!

22:26.810 --> 22:28.110
Knew you'd be back.

22:28.110 --> 22:31.840
Oh, OK, back up, limey.

22:31.850 --> 22:32.850
Fine, fine.

22:48.900 --> 22:49.700
Slowly, babe.

22:49.700 --> 22:50.700
I'm drunk.

22:53.200 --> 22:55.870
Right.

22:55.870 --> 22:57.170
Watch your head.

23:00.270 --> 23:01.270
Whoa.

23:06.110 --> 23:07.110
Yeah.

23:15.160 --> 23:19.830
So this is the house.

23:19.830 --> 23:20.830
Old house.

23:20.830 --> 23:21.830
I like it.

23:35.110 --> 23:36.110
All right?

23:36.110 --> 23:38.210
Oh, yeah, I'm fine, thanks.

23:38.210 --> 23:39.110
It's all right.

23:39.110 --> 23:40.250
No.

23:40.250 --> 23:41.780
You don't have
to play like them.

23:41.780 --> 23:42.480
We can just cuddle.

23:42.480 --> 23:43.780
No.

23:43.780 --> 23:49.960
Um, see, I, um...
I'm not gonna bite.

23:49.960 --> 23:54.730
I have, um... you
see... oh my God!

23:54.730 --> 23:56.360
Shoot.

23:56.360 --> 24:01.030
Hey, guys, do you have
any drinks in the house?

24:01.040 --> 24:02.040
Uh-uh.

24:06.140 --> 24:09.370
No fucking drinks?

24:09.380 --> 24:12.480
No whiskey, no vodka?

24:12.480 --> 24:13.950
You got some ganja, right?

24:18.050 --> 24:22.320
No, we don't have any
ganja in our house.

24:22.320 --> 24:24.020
Look, don't worry, yeah?

24:24.020 --> 24:28.390
Because if I put my hand in
my back pocket... oh, yes!

24:31.300 --> 24:32.970
Come on, get up, get on it.

24:32.970 --> 24:33.930
Three cheers, baby.

24:33.930 --> 24:36.500
Let's drink.

24:36.500 --> 24:39.840
Come on.

24:39.840 --> 24:41.140
You're so pretty.

24:45.010 --> 24:46.010
For me?

24:48.480 --> 24:50.020
Drink.

24:50.020 --> 24:51.150
Knock it back.

24:51.150 --> 24:54.150
Ooh, knock it back!

24:54.160 --> 24:55.490
Yeah, baby, yeah!

25:00.090 --> 25:00.990
Good girl.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.290
Professional right here.

25:02.300 --> 25:04.930
Oh, yeah.

25:04.930 --> 25:06.530
No, I... no.

25:06.530 --> 25:09.200
I had a lot at the bar.

25:09.200 --> 25:10.100
Take some.

25:10.100 --> 25:13.270
Come on.

25:13.270 --> 25:14.170
Come on, it's OK.

25:14.180 --> 25:14.940
What's in here?

25:14.940 --> 25:15.940
Alcohol.

25:17.880 --> 25:18.880
Just alcohol.

25:22.920 --> 25:23.920
Yeah!

25:33.160 --> 25:35.060
Aren't you gonna have some?

25:35.060 --> 25:35.960
No.

25:35.960 --> 25:36.960
I don't drink.

26:12.630 --> 26:16.870
Drin... what the
fuck are you doing?

26:16.870 --> 26:19.910
What the fuck are
you doing, Julia?

26:19.910 --> 26:21.540
You're a crazy bitch.

26:21.540 --> 26:23.910
Stay away from me.

26:23.910 --> 26:26.080
Byron!

26:26.080 --> 26:27.510
You're dead.

26:27.510 --> 26:30.150
You're dead!

26:30.150 --> 26:33.150
Don't you come near me.

26:33.150 --> 26:34.450
Fuck off away from me.

26:34.460 --> 26:36.960
Fuck off away from me with that!

26:36.960 --> 26:37.890
Help!

26:37.890 --> 26:41.590
Byron!

26:41.600 --> 26:44.600
Stay away from me.

26:44.600 --> 26:46.570
Don't, please, please, don't.

26:46.570 --> 26:47.570
Don't... don't do that.

26:47.570 --> 26:48.500
Don't do that, please.

26:48.500 --> 26:49.400
Stay away from me.

26:49.400 --> 26:50.400
What are you doing?

27:06.050 --> 27:07.250
You fucking crazy bitch!

27:13.990 --> 27:14.990
Help!

27:34.680 --> 27:35.680
Help!

27:38.520 --> 27:40.290
God!

27:40.290 --> 27:41.190
What are you doing?

27:41.190 --> 27:42.090
Please!

27:42.090 --> 27:44.560
Please, don't!

27:44.560 --> 27:48.230
Stop it, please stop it!

27:48.230 --> 27:50.030
What are you doing?

27:59.570 --> 28:01.470
No!

29:01.200 --> 29:02.100
Stay away.

29:02.100 --> 29:06.240
Please, sorry,
I'm sorry, please.

29:06.240 --> 29:08.170
Please don't.

29:08.180 --> 29:12.080
Help me, please, help me.

29:12.080 --> 29:15.780
Stay away.

29:15.780 --> 29:17.720
Help me!

29:17.720 --> 29:19.750
Someone help!

29:19.750 --> 29:20.750
Help!

29:24.560 --> 29:28.060
Please, please, please, don't.

29:28.060 --> 29:29.260
No!

29:29.260 --> 29:33.070
No, no, no, no, no!

29:33.070 --> 29:35.530
Go!

29:35.540 --> 29:38.640
Help, help, help!

29:38.640 --> 29:39.640
Look I...

30:07.600 --> 30:10.270
Someone help!

30:22.450 --> 30:25.380
Help!

30:25.390 --> 30:26.390
No!

30:30.760 --> 30:31.760
Please!

30:34.560 --> 30:36.630
Help!

30:40.430 --> 30:43.200
Please, stop!

30:46.310 --> 30:49.440
What are you doing?

30:49.440 --> 30:51.840
No!

30:51.850 --> 30:54.210
Stop, please, help!

30:54.210 --> 30:55.210
Stop!

33:36.740 --> 33:38.710
Alex, you're up before I am?

33:38.710 --> 33:40.630
I know, I'm as
shocked as you are.

33:49.760 --> 33:52.660
Ugh.

33:52.660 --> 33:54.330
I did not sleep well last night.

33:58.760 --> 34:01.670
I had the strangest dream.

34:01.670 --> 34:04.770
What kind of dream?

34:04.770 --> 34:06.540
Violent.

34:06.540 --> 34:07.740
Disgustingly violent.

34:12.580 --> 34:17.620
Remind me never to drink from a
British man's flask ever again.

34:17.620 --> 34:18.750
Yeah.

34:18.750 --> 34:20.630
That feels like
it was a mistake.

34:23.389 --> 34:26.590
I had a similar dream.

34:26.590 --> 34:28.489
It was disturbing.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.530
I killed Colin.

34:30.530 --> 34:31.730
In my dream, I mean.

34:31.730 --> 34:34.429
Yeah, I had the same dream.

34:34.429 --> 34:35.800
But it was Byron.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.870
We were roofied.

34:41.880 --> 34:46.380
Those guys roofied us
last night, didn't they?

34:46.380 --> 34:47.679
I mean, that would explain it.

34:47.679 --> 34:50.750
This is why we're feeling
so disoriented today.

34:50.750 --> 34:54.020
It explains us blacking out.

34:54.020 --> 34:55.850
That dream was so real, though.

35:00.560 --> 35:01.490
God.

35:01.500 --> 35:02.790
I Ugh.

35:02.800 --> 35:08.630
I... I honestly feel
really sick right now.

35:08.640 --> 35:09.720
So where are the guys?

35:23.050 --> 35:24.050
Not here.

35:27.020 --> 35:28.520
Wait a minute.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.500
My jewelry's gone.

35:53.510 --> 35:54.510
No!

35:54.510 --> 35:55.510
Oh, god!

35:59.020 --> 36:04.520
All my stuff is missing, too!

36:04.520 --> 36:08.160
They stole the bracelet mom
gave me before she died.

36:08.160 --> 36:09.490
Hey.

36:09.500 --> 36:10.560
Listen.

36:10.560 --> 36:11.660
Rach.

36:11.670 --> 36:16.070
We're gonna get it back.

36:16.070 --> 36:19.570
I promise.

36:19.570 --> 36:21.570
Come here.

36:21.580 --> 36:22.580
It's OK.

36:29.180 --> 36:30.080
Byron!

36:30.080 --> 36:31.850
Are you here?

36:31.850 --> 36:32.880
Give me back my shit!

36:32.890 --> 36:33.790
Colin!

36:33.790 --> 36:34.790
Vlad!

36:40.630 --> 36:42.490
Are you fucking kidding me?

36:42.500 --> 36:43.500
Look.

36:46.230 --> 36:47.930
Those bastards
robbed us, and they

36:47.930 --> 36:49.200
even took the stupid statue.

36:52.910 --> 36:54.840
Why would they take
a worn down statue?

36:54.840 --> 36:56.070
This is bullshit.

36:56.080 --> 36:58.140
This doesn't make any sense.

36:58.140 --> 37:03.520
If... if they robbed us, why
didn't they take something more

37:03.520 --> 37:08.890
valuable, like computers or... or
cell phones, or iPods, or cash?

37:08.890 --> 37:10.220
This just doesn't add up.

37:10.220 --> 37:11.520
Yeah, I guess.

37:11.530 --> 37:12.720
Maybe they were in a hurry.

37:12.730 --> 37:15.290
Alex, the statue would be heavy.

37:15.300 --> 37:18.960
It's not like an in a
hurry kind of thing.

37:18.970 --> 37:21.530
This isn't good.

37:21.540 --> 37:27.570
No, no, this is... this
is not good, you guys.

37:27.570 --> 37:32.010
What the hell
happened last night?

37:32.010 --> 37:34.210
I mean, first I'm freaked
that we killed them,

37:34.210 --> 37:36.810
and now I'm pissed
that they robbed us.

37:36.820 --> 37:38.650
I mean, which is it?

37:38.650 --> 37:39.750
Jules, calm down.

37:39.750 --> 37:43.220
We'll figure it out.

37:43.220 --> 37:44.860
What are we going to do?

37:44.860 --> 37:46.820
If that statue was an
antique or something,

37:46.830 --> 37:48.660
it would be worth
a lot of money.

37:48.660 --> 37:50.130
How much money?

37:50.130 --> 37:51.030
I don't know.

37:51.030 --> 37:51.930
Thousands?

37:51.930 --> 37:52.830
I mean, I'm not stupid.

37:52.830 --> 37:56.230
I've seen antique roadshows.

37:56.240 --> 37:58.240
It's not like we're
renting the place, OK?

37:58.240 --> 38:00.640
The program put us
up here, and they

38:00.640 --> 38:02.270
can't hold us accountable
for everything inside.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.280
Yes they can.

38:06.710 --> 38:09.310
I think that we should
just tell them everything,

38:09.320 --> 38:10.920
before they think that
we took that thing

38:10.920 --> 38:12.680
whilst fleeing the country.

38:12.690 --> 38:14.890
Jules, is honesty really the
best policy in this situation?

38:14.890 --> 38:16.960
I mean, it's not like we're
in the right state of mind.

38:16.960 --> 38:18.760
Everyone's a little freaked out.

38:18.760 --> 38:21.190
Yes, I do.

38:21.190 --> 38:25.000
Well, what do you think?

38:25.000 --> 38:26.230
I guess so.

38:26.230 --> 38:30.000
But if we end up
in a Thai prison,

38:30.000 --> 38:32.800
I'm not digging cockroaches
out of your ears.

38:32.810 --> 38:34.210
I'm making the call.

38:37.380 --> 38:38.680
Hello?

38:38.680 --> 38:40.180
This is Julia.

38:40.180 --> 38:43.280
So, listen, somebody
broke into our house

38:43.280 --> 38:45.080
and they took all
of our gold jewelry

38:45.090 --> 38:48.050
and even some personal items.

38:48.050 --> 38:49.320
Yeah.

38:49.320 --> 38:54.030
And I hate to say this,
but, um, they took

38:54.030 --> 38:55.230
that life-size gold statue.

38:59.000 --> 39:01.080
What do you mean, there
is no gold statue?

39:10.880 --> 39:11.940
What did she say?

39:11.950 --> 39:12.950
Are we screwed?

39:15.680 --> 39:16.380
What?

39:16.380 --> 39:18.820
Was it like 1,000 years old?

39:18.820 --> 39:20.720
She said there is no statue.

39:20.720 --> 39:22.690
What?

39:22.690 --> 39:24.120
Yeah.

39:24.120 --> 39:26.190
I told her the whole story.

39:26.190 --> 39:28.760
I even described the
statue in full detail.

39:28.760 --> 39:30.330
And the program
housing director said

39:30.330 --> 39:32.960
there is no statue
at this residence,

39:32.970 --> 39:35.030
but she'll look into it.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.740
She'll look into it?

39:37.740 --> 39:39.970
Yeah.

39:39.970 --> 39:42.340
That was it.

39:42.340 --> 39:44.460
I think she thought I
was crazy or something.

39:48.210 --> 39:50.050
So I guess we're off the hook.

39:50.050 --> 39:51.080
This can't be right.

39:51.080 --> 39:53.690
It was right there.

39:53.690 --> 39:54.690
Right?

39:54.690 --> 39:55.920
I remember it, too.

39:58.720 --> 39:59.990
I think.

39:59.990 --> 40:01.360
You think?

40:01.360 --> 40:03.330
Well, I don't know.

40:03.330 --> 40:08.330
At this point, I... I barely
even remember last night,

40:08.330 --> 40:10.300
let alone the guys
leaving this morning.

40:10.300 --> 40:13.740
So yes, I am doubting
my memory a little.

40:13.740 --> 40:17.240
Look, I know it's been a
crazy morning, but I'm hungry.

40:17.240 --> 40:18.710
Can we please just
go get some food

40:18.710 --> 40:20.340
and talk about all this
serious stuff later?

40:20.350 --> 40:23.450
Yeah, I... I need a
break from all this.

40:23.450 --> 40:25.380
OK, let's just get some
food and then find out

40:25.390 --> 40:27.050
more about the statue later.

40:27.050 --> 40:29.250
Why are we trying to replace
the statue when the program

40:29.260 --> 40:30.890
thinks it was never there?

40:30.890 --> 40:33.830
I just want to find out how
much that thing was worth.

40:33.830 --> 40:35.160
We're not crazy.

40:35.160 --> 40:38.060
That statue was in the house.

40:38.060 --> 40:39.330
I don't know, Rach.

40:39.330 --> 40:40.970
Do we even care
what it's worth now?

40:40.970 --> 40:43.230
I mean, it's gone.

40:43.240 --> 40:44.440
I already feel guilty enough.

40:44.440 --> 40:45.340
Yes.

40:45.340 --> 40:46.370
Isn't this bugging you?

40:46.370 --> 40:47.470
I mean, where did it go?

40:47.470 --> 40:50.110
The guys stole it, remember?

40:50.110 --> 40:51.240
Yeah, I thought that, too.

40:51.240 --> 40:55.180
But something just feels off.

40:55.180 --> 40:56.510
Excuse me, sir.

40:56.520 --> 41:00.790
Um, do you have any of
these, but made of gold?

41:00.790 --> 41:01.950
Oh, yeah.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.860
Many, many statues.

41:03.860 --> 41:04.820
What you like?

41:04.820 --> 41:06.420
Very good price.

41:06.430 --> 41:10.330
Uh, like this, but made of
real gold, and like a child.

41:14.530 --> 41:17.270
Yes?

41:17.270 --> 41:21.270
No, like a very young
looking little girl.

41:21.270 --> 41:26.240
Um, like her size.

41:26.250 --> 41:28.380
But real gold, not paint.

41:32.080 --> 41:33.380
Real child, real gold?

41:33.390 --> 41:36.190
Do... do you know
what that means?

41:36.190 --> 41:38.820
What kind of statue that is?

41:38.830 --> 41:40.890
No.

41:40.890 --> 41:41.930
I don't have any more.

41:41.930 --> 41:43.430
Don't sell here anymore.

41:43.430 --> 41:46.060
Uh, do you know what I'm
talking about, though?

41:46.070 --> 41:46.960
Do you understand?

41:46.970 --> 41:48.070
Understand, yes.

41:48.070 --> 41:49.530
But we don't have.

41:49.540 --> 41:50.840
We don't do that here.

41:50.840 --> 41:51.540
Good shop.

41:51.540 --> 41:53.140
Very good shop.

41:53.140 --> 41:54.040
Thank you.

41:54.040 --> 41:55.810
Goodbye.

41:55.810 --> 41:56.810
OK.

41:57.980 --> 41:58.980
Thank you.

42:10.020 --> 42:11.960
Hi.

42:11.960 --> 42:12.960
Can I help you?

42:16.000 --> 42:17.000
Or not.

42:23.900 --> 42:24.600
Rach!

42:24.600 --> 42:27.000
Rachel!

42:27.010 --> 42:28.370
Don't follow the
creepy Asian girl!

42:28.370 --> 42:29.370
Rach!

43:36.110 --> 43:37.210
Oh, good, we caught up.

43:37.210 --> 43:38.410
Yeah.

43:38.410 --> 43:40.410
Now we can all get
murdered together.

43:50.190 --> 43:51.290
What is this place?

43:51.290 --> 43:52.990
It's disgusting.

43:52.990 --> 43:56.190
I don't know.

43:56.200 --> 43:58.680
Man, it looks like some sort of
abandoned village or something.

44:22.490 --> 44:25.590
Oh my god, how is
she not out of breath?

44:25.590 --> 44:26.490
I don't know.

44:26.490 --> 44:27.590
She's a child?

44:27.590 --> 44:28.590
Oh.

44:36.440 --> 44:39.100
I think she wants
us to go inside.

44:39.110 --> 44:40.570
Thoughts?

44:40.570 --> 44:42.610
Well, we're here, aren't we?

44:59.660 --> 45:02.430
Oh my god, let's just get
the hell out of here, OK?

45:02.430 --> 45:05.530
This place is a shithole.

45:05.530 --> 45:07.030
And she's a drunk.

45:07.030 --> 45:08.030
Shh!

45:12.700 --> 45:14.470
Hi.

45:14.470 --> 45:15.770
Um, we're looking for a statue.

45:15.780 --> 45:17.340
It's gold, like a child.

45:17.340 --> 45:18.340
Got one?

45:22.180 --> 45:23.150
Not like that.

45:23.150 --> 45:24.780
Um, this one's different.

45:24.780 --> 45:28.350
It's, uh... it's gold,
like, um, like this.

45:28.350 --> 45:29.350
Real gold.

45:35.190 --> 45:38.230
I don't think I
have what you want.

45:38.230 --> 45:41.100
The little girl from the
market implied that you would.

45:41.100 --> 45:43.170
The little girl?

45:43.170 --> 45:44.170
She's right there.

45:49.370 --> 45:50.170
She was right there.

45:50.180 --> 45:51.180
Alex.

45:55.380 --> 45:56.510
All right.

45:56.520 --> 45:58.220
All right, well, thank you.

45:58.220 --> 46:00.680
Let's go.

46:00.690 --> 46:03.190
Yeah, uh,.

46:03.190 --> 46:04.060
Um, whatever.

46:04.060 --> 46:05.160
Thank you.

46:05.160 --> 46:06.260
We're just going to go.

46:06.260 --> 46:07.260
Stop!

46:15.630 --> 46:21.110
This is the golden statue,
just like you said.

46:21.110 --> 46:22.370
Yes, that's it!

46:22.380 --> 46:24.280
What is it?

46:24.280 --> 46:28.350
Kumari, the golden girl.

46:28.350 --> 46:30.250
Is that gold real?

46:30.250 --> 46:31.480
Yes.

46:31.480 --> 46:33.620
Very special.

46:33.620 --> 46:35.250
Very rare.

46:35.250 --> 46:37.120
Very old.

46:37.120 --> 46:39.160
So I guess you're
not selling it, then.

46:39.160 --> 46:41.460
Not for sale.

46:41.460 --> 46:44.160
Very, very good luck.

46:44.160 --> 46:46.160
Is this why you want one?

46:46.170 --> 46:50.300
We had one, but we lost
it, or it was stolen.

46:50.300 --> 46:52.440
We're not really sure
what happened to it.

46:52.440 --> 46:54.810
How did you get it?

46:54.810 --> 46:56.770
Did you buy it on
the black market?

46:56.780 --> 46:58.240
No!

46:58.240 --> 46:59.610
It was in our house.

46:59.610 --> 47:03.350
Kumari is meant
to be worshipped.

47:03.350 --> 47:06.280
Born from a very dark place.

47:06.290 --> 47:08.420
It is meant to bring light.

47:08.420 --> 47:10.620
It's just a statue.

47:10.620 --> 47:13.620
Not just any statue.

47:13.630 --> 47:15.230
It chose you.

47:15.230 --> 47:16.530
You know what?

47:16.530 --> 47:18.730
I've... I've had just
about enough of this.

47:18.730 --> 47:22.430
Kumari is a child
of great sacrifice,

47:22.440 --> 47:24.540
but it is a child no less.

47:24.540 --> 47:30.170
It feels jealousy,
anger, resentment.

47:30.180 --> 47:32.540
Kumari led you here.

47:32.550 --> 47:34.180
She escaped.

47:34.180 --> 47:36.680
Lady say what?

47:36.680 --> 47:41.190
The little girl,
she is a vision.

47:41.190 --> 47:42.420
Not real.

47:42.420 --> 47:43.520
Bullshit.

47:43.520 --> 47:45.620
She is following you.

47:45.630 --> 47:47.860
She is your statue.

47:47.860 --> 47:49.930
You let her out.

47:49.930 --> 47:53.300
What the hell are
you talking about?

48:06.910 --> 48:10.680
These are for your protection.

48:10.680 --> 48:16.250
You must wear them
to keep her out.

48:16.260 --> 48:21.460
The kumari, she
has turned on you.

48:21.460 --> 48:25.230
She is ready to
take her revenge.

48:25.230 --> 48:28.570
OK, I've had enough freaky
for the day.

48:28.570 --> 48:29.770
Yeah, right behind you.

48:29.770 --> 48:34.270
You know you sound nuts, right?

48:34.270 --> 48:38.840
If you knew what it
took to make a kumari,

48:38.840 --> 48:40.720
you would see
things differently!

48:53.430 --> 48:55.360
So what now?

48:55.360 --> 48:55.990
Guess we go home.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.390
Great.

48:57.400 --> 48:59.630
That sounds like a
blast and a half.

48:59.630 --> 49:01.230
Alex, what are you doing?

49:01.230 --> 49:04.700
Of junk given to you
by a drunken old woman

49:04.700 --> 49:05.800
to keep you safe?

49:05.810 --> 49:06.870
Please.

49:06.870 --> 49:08.240
It's your funeral.

49:13.250 --> 49:16.250
I'm gonna put you where
everyone can see you.

49:16.250 --> 49:17.820
All right.

49:17.820 --> 49:21.420
So, Julia tells me you guys
want to know a little bit more

49:21.420 --> 49:23.750
about this Thai legend.

49:23.760 --> 49:25.360
The kumari.

49:25.360 --> 49:27.560
We're getting more
into the culture.

49:27.560 --> 49:29.360
Oh yeah?

49:29.360 --> 49:32.300
Because I thought it was some
creepy old lady that told you

49:32.300 --> 49:34.430
a ghost child was haunting you.

49:34.430 --> 49:35.830
Well, it was that, too.

49:35.840 --> 49:36.840
I filled him in.

49:36.840 --> 49:37.740
Obviously.

49:37.740 --> 49:39.540
All right.

49:39.540 --> 49:42.270
Well, it turns out this is some
pretty serious shit, all right?

49:42.280 --> 49:46.480
When a kid died violently,
in some horrific accident

49:46.480 --> 49:49.480
or whatever... what they would
do, they would take the body,

49:49.480 --> 49:51.750
cover it in blood,
dry burn the bones,

49:51.750 --> 49:53.880
and encase the
damn thing in gold.

49:53.890 --> 49:57.420
All part of this
ritual, the kumari.

49:57.420 --> 49:59.490
Supposed to bring good luck.

49:59.490 --> 50:00.590
That's gross.

50:00.590 --> 50:02.730
And it gets worse.

50:02.730 --> 50:05.700
A lot of necromancers...
They wanted more children.

50:05.700 --> 50:07.670
So what they would do...
They would go out there

50:07.670 --> 50:09.300
and actually start murdering.

50:09.300 --> 50:11.900
And eventually, the Thai
government banned the practice,

50:11.900 --> 50:14.410
but they still do it, and they
sell them on the black market

50:14.410 --> 50:15.770
for thousands of dollars.

50:15.780 --> 50:17.310
Oh my god.

50:17.310 --> 50:19.410
That's why that old lady
asked where we got it.

50:19.410 --> 50:22.480
It was actually supposed
to be worshipped.

50:22.480 --> 50:25.620
And from what I hear, you guys
kind of failed on the worship

50:25.620 --> 50:27.580
part and let it get away.

50:27.590 --> 50:28.820
Oh my god, it was stolen.

50:28.820 --> 50:30.450
How was that our fault?

50:30.460 --> 50:32.690
Well, the old witch said
that we let it escape,

50:32.690 --> 50:33.920
so maybe that's what she meant.

50:33.930 --> 50:35.690
I don't think it
physically escaped.

50:35.700 --> 50:39.660
I think it had to do more
with the spirit of the child.

50:39.670 --> 50:41.870
Like it was trapped?

50:41.870 --> 50:42.800
Yeah.

50:42.800 --> 50:45.340
And now it wants revenge.

50:45.340 --> 50:48.740
Best advice I can give you?

50:48.740 --> 50:50.370
Shane?

50:50.380 --> 50:52.940
Shane?

50:52.950 --> 50:55.880
Shit, my computer just died.

50:55.880 --> 50:57.580
Did that really just happen?

50:57.580 --> 50:58.480
Yeah.

50:58.480 --> 50:59.720
What are the odds?

50:59.720 --> 51:01.750
He's like, you guys
should, then zap.

51:01.750 --> 51:02.850
Thank you, Alex.

51:02.860 --> 51:06.620
That was a super helpful recap.

51:06.630 --> 51:09.630
OK, new plan, we move.

51:09.630 --> 51:11.560
As in leave this house?

51:11.560 --> 51:14.060
Yes, as in we go to the
housing office tomorrow

51:14.070 --> 51:17.370
I mean, do you think they're
going to be OK with that,

51:17.370 --> 51:19.000
and not just think we're
three spoiled Americans

51:19.000 --> 51:21.410
part of our volunteer work?

51:21.410 --> 51:23.510
I really don't care
what they think.

51:23.510 --> 51:29.510
Thai statue or no statue,
this... this house... it's

51:29.520 --> 51:31.120
giving me a really bad feeling.

51:31.120 --> 51:33.720
The Brits and the old man,
and... and the statue...

51:33.720 --> 51:35.550
Well, the Brits were my fault.

51:35.550 --> 51:37.020
That's true.

51:37.020 --> 51:38.020
And Alex's.

51:38.020 --> 51:39.520
- Not really.
- You know what?

51:39.530 --> 51:41.390
It doesn't matter
whose fault it is.

51:41.390 --> 51:43.990
Everything about this just
screams get the hell out!

52:36.650 --> 52:37.650
You serious?

52:46.960 --> 52:47.960
OK.

53:31.200 --> 53:35.170
It's not real, it's
not real, it's not real.

57:13.390 --> 57:14.390
Bloody clothes.

57:32.880 --> 57:35.450
Oh my God!

57:35.450 --> 57:36.350
Someone!

57:36.350 --> 57:38.050
Somebody help me!

57:38.050 --> 57:40.350
Get me the hell out of here!

58:17.990 --> 58:20.190
Oh my God, oh my God!

58:20.190 --> 58:21.360
There's something in there!

58:21.360 --> 58:22.360
I felt it!

58:22.360 --> 58:24.330
There's something
in the bathroom.

58:24.330 --> 58:26.130
The girl was in the bathroom.

58:26.130 --> 58:27.860
I saw her, and suddenly...

58:27.870 --> 58:30.430
I was in there, and there
was this thing in the closet,

58:30.440 --> 58:32.070
and it started crawling in the...

58:32.070 --> 58:34.370
Rachel, I saw her in the
water, and then in the mirror.

58:34.370 --> 58:35.570
It was the girl.

58:35.570 --> 58:36.470
Hey!

58:36.480 --> 58:37.370
Hey!

58:37.380 --> 58:39.110
Everybody shut up.

58:39.110 --> 58:40.580
Julia, get dressed.

58:40.580 --> 58:42.080
Go.

58:42.080 --> 58:44.880
What is going on?

58:44.880 --> 58:45.580
I don't know.

58:45.580 --> 58:46.880
We can't stay here.

58:46.890 --> 58:49.490
I'm seriously freaked
out right now.

58:49.490 --> 58:51.290
Me too, but where
are we gonna go?

58:51.290 --> 58:52.920
It's the middle of the night.

58:52.930 --> 58:54.590
It's not like we're
in freaking Bangkok!

58:54.590 --> 58:56.430
We're in the sticks of Thailand!

58:56.430 --> 58:58.090
Well then, we'll call a
cab, and we'll have it take

58:58.100 --> 58:59.060
us somewhere more populated.

58:59.060 --> 59:00.430
Who has a cell phone?

59:00.430 --> 59:03.300
I haven't had service
since I got here.

59:03.300 --> 59:05.200
Shit.

59:05.200 --> 59:06.570
We're sleeping upstairs.

59:06.570 --> 59:07.470
All right?

59:07.470 --> 59:09.870
Safety in numbers.

59:09.880 --> 59:12.610
And then I think we need
to go see that old lady.

59:12.610 --> 59:13.840
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Yes.

59:13.850 --> 59:14.610
No, no, no, no, no, no.

59:14.610 --> 59:15.210
Yes.

59:15.210 --> 59:16.550
No!

59:16.550 --> 59:17.980
You said we were just
going to switch houses.

59:17.980 --> 59:22.020
That seems like a
much, much safer plan.

59:22.020 --> 59:25.260
I don't think it's the house.

59:25.260 --> 59:26.460
I think it's the girl.

01:01:42.730 --> 01:01:44.230
Mmm.

01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:45.230
Wake up.

01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:45.730
Mm-mm.

01:01:45.730 --> 01:01:46.730
Wake up.

01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:55.610
God, Rach.

01:01:55.610 --> 01:01:57.440
You guys ready?

01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:58.440
I guess.

01:01:58.440 --> 01:01:59.440
OK.

01:02:06.050 --> 01:02:08.350
Is that mud?

01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:09.720
On the floor?

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:12.020
We probably just
tracked it in yesterday.

01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:13.320
Come on, let's go.

01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:17.630
Come on.

01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:24.070
Where is she?

01:02:24.070 --> 01:02:26.170
Oh, this is not a good sign.

01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:27.700
Great.

01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:29.670
WE came all the way down here,
and she's not even around.

01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:32.240
Something doesn't feel right.

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:35.750
No, not at all.

01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:36.750
Come on.

01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:09.550
What are you doing here?

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:15.520
Excuse me.

01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:23.590
So sorry.

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:26.230
Uh, he used to know
the family that

01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:28.530
lived here, many years ago.

01:03:28.530 --> 01:03:31.270
Now he gets confused and forgets
that they're no longer with us.

01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:32.540
Is he OK?

01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:33.440
Yeah, he's fine.

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:34.470
I'll just take him home.

01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:35.240
Wait.

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:36.140
What is that?

01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:37.240
What is he holding?

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:49.290
He's not making any sense.

01:03:49.290 --> 01:03:50.720
I'm sorry again.

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:53.820
No, why was he pointing at us?

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:56.660
He said, you all
took it from her.

01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:05.270
He knows something about this.

01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:06.170
I can feel it.

01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:07.470
Oh my god.

01:04:07.470 --> 01:04:10.310
Did you see the way
he was pointing at us?

01:04:10.310 --> 01:04:11.910
It's like we did
something wrong.

01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:12.810
It's that amulet.

01:04:12.810 --> 01:04:14.180
The one he was holding.

01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:16.610
Yeah, from the spirit house.

01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:17.810
Excuse me?

01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:19.280
When we first
arrived, I snatched it

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:20.320
from the spirit house.

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:21.420
Oh.

01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:22.520
I thought it looked cool.

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:24.350
I don't know how
he got it, though.

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:27.360
That spirit house that is
now full of dead flowers?

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:28.690
Yeah, that one.

01:04:28.690 --> 01:04:30.660
All right, I'm going over there.

01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:31.900
He can help.

01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:34.930
No, Rachel, he doesn't
even speak English!

01:04:34.930 --> 01:04:35.830
You heard him.

01:04:35.830 --> 01:04:37.200
He is insane.

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:40.670
Jules, we're having
horrifying murder dreams,

01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:44.270
seeing little girl ghosts...
I'm going over there, OK?

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.320
I want this to stop.

01:04:49.410 --> 01:04:50.710
Fine.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.920
Creepy house across
the way it is.

01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:11.300
Oh, it's you.

01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:12.700
How can I help you?

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:13.840
I need to talk to that old man.

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:15.470
Yeah, it's an emergency.

01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:16.670
I'm sorry, but he's resting now.

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:17.640
Please?

01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:20.240
You can translate!

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:22.310
Excuse me, but
this is very rude.

01:05:22.310 --> 01:05:24.280
Look, I know he barged
into your house.

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:25.420
I'm sorry.

01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:26.650
But he's not well.

01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:27.880
Please.

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:30.220
I'm really sorry,
but this is urgent.

01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:33.560
We need you to ask him about the
previous owners of that house

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:34.820
to see if there's a connection.

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:35.960
Connection to what?

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:38.430
To the amulet that he took.

01:05:38.430 --> 01:05:40.000
OK?

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.570
And then there's this little
girl statue that went missing,

01:05:42.570 --> 01:05:44.000
and I just need to
talk to him, OK?

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.770
I am not going to ask
him anything about that.

01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:59.020
He said he'd help you.

01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:00.020
Thank you.

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:24.440
The old house belonged to his
brother Tiwa many years ago.

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:27.040
Tiwa had a beautiful
wife named Samorn

01:06:27.050 --> 01:06:28.880
and a daughter named Vanida.

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:33.350
MALE SPEAKER Tiwa was

01:06:33.350 --> 01:06:34.850
a good brother, and a good man.

01:06:48.430 --> 01:06:50.500
Samorn was pregnant,
and they knew

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:52.600
they were going to have a
son, which was something

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:54.500
they had always wished for.

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:57.570
But Samorn was very ill.

01:06:57.580 --> 01:07:00.010
She had gone to see many
doctors, but none of them

01:07:00.010 --> 01:07:02.510
could help her.

01:07:11.090 --> 01:07:13.020
Tiwa was very desperate.

01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:15.890
He went to see a fortune
teller in the village.

01:07:15.890 --> 01:07:18.460
Some people called her a witch.

01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:21.530
She was known for
communicating with the dead.

01:07:21.530 --> 01:07:23.730
Her name was Isra.

01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:26.570
Tiwa asked her.

01:07:26.570 --> 01:07:30.740
Tiwa begged her to save the
life of his wife and unborn son.

01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:33.110
He said he would do anything.

01:07:33.110 --> 01:07:37.450
She asked him if he
would really do anything.

01:07:37.450 --> 01:07:42.490
Isra told him that he would have
to trade one life for another.

01:07:42.490 --> 01:07:46.060
But they would have to come
from the same bloodline.

01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:49.460
Tiwa realized that this meant
that he would have to give

01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:51.690
up not only his
own life, but that

01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:54.030
of his young daughter, Vanida.

01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:02.770
He did not want to do this, but
he felt he had no other choice.

01:08:02.770 --> 01:08:04.640
Isra explained that
there was a way

01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:08.040
to keep Vanida's spirit alive.

01:08:08.050 --> 01:08:12.050
She said if she was covered in
the blood of a tortured human,

01:08:12.050 --> 01:08:16.020
Tiwa's blood, and
then encased in gold,

01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:18.020
that her spirit
would live on forever

01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:21.960
and could bring
luck to her family.

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:25.130
Tiwa agreed to do this,
but his wife was not happy.

01:08:27.930 --> 01:08:32.470
But he could not let
his wife and son die.

01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:34.840
She asked Tiwa not
to do it, but Tiwa

01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:38.439
was determined to save his wife
and unborn son, no matter what

01:08:38.439 --> 01:08:40.540
the cost.

01:08:43.979 --> 01:08:46.580
He asked me for a favor.

01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:49.050
He asked me to help
with this ritual,

01:08:49.050 --> 01:08:52.689
to bring my tools and
gold from my shop.

01:08:52.689 --> 01:08:53.689
I told him no.

01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:57.830
But he begged me.

01:08:57.830 --> 01:08:58.830
What could I do?

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:08.670
The
next day, I went to his house

01:09:08.670 --> 01:09:11.770
with my supplies.

01:09:11.779 --> 01:09:14.609
We went down to the basement.

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:15.609
Down to hell.

01:09:54.990 --> 01:09:56.790
She was so small.

01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:58.090
Too easy to kill.

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:10.000
When it was done, we went
upstairs to get Samorn.

01:10:13.170 --> 01:10:15.200
When I entered the
room, I saw her.

01:10:15.210 --> 01:10:17.510
It is an image I cannot shake.

01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:23.180
There she was, hanging
from the rafters,

01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:27.850
the beautiful, pregnant Samorn.

01:10:27.850 --> 01:10:30.620
She had hung herself.

01:10:33.290 --> 01:10:35.890
Everything had gone wrong.

01:10:35.890 --> 01:10:37.050
The ritual was for nothing.

01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:44.630
Isra warned me that the child's
spirit would now be restless.

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:45.640
Her death in vain.

01:10:51.070 --> 01:10:59.070
So we created the amulet and
placed it in the spirit house

01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:08.890
so that her spirit would
not be free to enter

01:11:08.890 --> 01:11:11.830
the world, until now.

01:11:11.830 --> 01:11:13.860
The statue in the house.

01:11:13.870 --> 01:11:15.260
It's Vanida, the little girl?

01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:17.190
And you made it
and you killed her?

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:30.950
Yes.

01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:32.650
How can we stop her?

01:11:47.130 --> 01:11:49.930
She is what she is.

01:11:49.930 --> 01:11:52.000
She's what we made her.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.200
Kumari cannot be stopped.

01:11:55.210 --> 01:11:57.130
There must be
something we can do.

01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:08.620
He wants you to have this.

01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:10.750
Thank you.

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.020
Will this help?

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:18.760
We should go.

01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:37.780
I cannot believe he
murdered that little girl.

01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:38.910
We need to leave right now.

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:41.020
His brother asked him to.

01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:42.890
And we can't just leave.

01:12:42.890 --> 01:12:43.820
You heard what he said.

01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:44.720
The girl is after us.

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:47.920
He could have said no.

01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:49.930
We wouldn't be in
this nightmare.

01:12:49.930 --> 01:12:51.390
It's not that easy!

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:54.230
These rituals are real to them.

01:12:54.230 --> 01:12:56.370
He probably thought
he was really helping.

01:12:56.370 --> 01:12:57.870
Are you serious right now?

01:12:57.870 --> 01:13:00.270
He killed Vanida!

01:13:00.270 --> 01:13:06.280
He sliced her open, drained her
blood, and covered her in gold!

01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:08.410
Like a doll!

01:13:08.410 --> 01:13:10.380
And for what?

01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:13.380
For an unborn child?

01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:14.350
Al, calm down!

01:13:14.350 --> 01:13:16.350
Don't tell me to calm down!

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:27.260
Give me that!

01:13:43.710 --> 01:13:44.810
There.

01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:45.820
It's done.

01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:51.850
What's with the salt, Al?

01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:53.460
Saw it on TV.

01:16:49.470 --> 01:16:50.470
Shh.

01:17:03.450 --> 01:17:04.950
It's coming from Sang's house.

01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:06.180
We need to get over there.

01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:07.620
No.

01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:09.120
D-don't you think we should
just call the police?

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:10.320
We have no service!

01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:12.020
What if he's in trouble?

01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:13.290
- What do we do?
- There's no time.

01:17:13.290 --> 01:17:14.290
Let's go!

01:17:30.070 --> 01:17:31.340
You killed him!

01:17:33.410 --> 01:17:34.710
You killed him!

01:17:34.710 --> 01:17:37.010
Just like you killed
your brother and Vanida!

01:17:37.010 --> 01:17:37.710
Why?

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:38.720
Why did you do this?

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:39.720
Why did you do it?

01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:40.720
No!

01:17:47.590 --> 01:17:52.130
Oh God, oh God, oh God.

01:17:52.130 --> 01:17:53.730
This is bad.

01:17:53.730 --> 01:17:54.660
This is so bad, Julie.

01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:55.560
Shut up.

01:17:55.570 --> 01:17:56.730
So so so, this is so bad.

01:17:56.730 --> 01:17:58.100
Julia, shut up.

01:17:58.100 --> 01:17:59.200
Shut up?

01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:00.240
I just murdered somebody!

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:01.700
Don't tell me to shut up!

01:18:01.710 --> 01:18:03.070
We murdered somebody.

01:18:03.070 --> 01:18:04.310
We're all here.

01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:05.980
It's all our fault, OK?

01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:07.480
We need to leave right now.

01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:09.510
What are we gonna
do with the body?

01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:11.380
Rachel, there are
two bodies here!

01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:12.510
Leave them!

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:13.420
Let's just go.

01:18:13.420 --> 01:18:14.420
Guys, come on.

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:28.230
I don't blame you, Julia.

01:18:28.230 --> 01:18:31.170
It had to be done.

01:18:31.170 --> 01:18:32.740
No it did not have to be done.

01:18:35.410 --> 01:18:36.410
I killed someone.

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:42.010
He was a murderer.

01:18:42.010 --> 01:18:44.080
I cannot believe what
I'm hearing right now!

01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:45.080
What is wrong with you?

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:48.420
Let's not talk about
it right now, OK?

01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:50.650
We need to leave this country.

01:18:50.650 --> 01:18:52.420
As in get on a plane.

01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:53.590
Everyone, go pack.

01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:56.190
I'm... I'm... Julia,
just go pack!

01:18:56.190 --> 01:18:57.190
All right!

01:19:34.330 --> 01:19:35.630
Where's that coming from?

01:19:35.630 --> 01:19:36.630
I don't know!

01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:46.810
I don't remember there
being a door there.

01:19:50.350 --> 01:19:52.410
Come on, Rach,
it's just a closet.

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:53.420
Let's go.

01:20:05.530 --> 01:20:08.530
It's the basement.

01:20:08.530 --> 01:20:10.500
Alex, are you down there?

01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:12.200
Guys, get down here.

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:13.280
You've gotta see this!

01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:22.180
God, what is that smell?

01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:24.480
Ugh.

01:20:35.890 --> 01:20:36.890
God.

01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:56.880
This look familiar to anyone?

01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:57.880
Oh, God!

01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:02.850
I dreamt this.

01:21:08.290 --> 01:21:09.730
So did I.

01:21:09.730 --> 01:21:11.390
I know it was
redundant, but me three.

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:15.430
Alex, this isn't funny.

01:21:15.430 --> 01:21:17.300
No one said it was.

01:21:34.250 --> 01:21:36.650
It was us, wasn't it?

01:21:36.650 --> 01:21:38.790
That's impossible.

01:21:46.330 --> 01:21:47.500
The bloody clothes.

01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:49.530
What bloody clothes?

01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:50.470
In my room.

01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:51.570
I found them.

01:21:51.570 --> 01:21:53.570
I didn't know what to do.

01:22:28.370 --> 01:22:29.450
And now it makes sense.

01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:34.280
It was us.

01:22:40.850 --> 01:22:41.920
It was always us.

01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:46.690
You're wrong.

01:22:46.690 --> 01:22:48.420
It started out as us.

01:22:48.430 --> 01:22:52.860
Then you two put your amulets
on, and then it was just me.

01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:53.860
Finally free.

01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:12.610
Alex, what are you doing?

01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:15.450
Showing you what I can do.

01:23:15.450 --> 01:23:18.620
What are you
talking about, Alex?

01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:20.320
Your witch is dead.

01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:23.360
I smashed her fucking face
in the jungle.

01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:25.360
And the nurse?

01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:26.530
Did him, too.

01:23:26.530 --> 01:23:28.060
Oh, and the old man?

01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:31.470
Well, you guys were there
for that.

01:23:31.470 --> 01:23:33.740
That... that was fun.

01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:35.800
Good job, Julia.

01:23:35.810 --> 01:23:39.640
I didn't think
you had it in you.

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:41.840
Alex, we're your family.

01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:43.750
You're not my family.

01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:08.540
Alex, what are you doing?

01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:09.540
Stop!

01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:18.850
No.

01:24:18.850 --> 01:24:19.850
Alex.

01:24:19.850 --> 01:24:20.920
Alex!

01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:21.820
Stop!

01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:24.820
What are you doing?

01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:27.790
Alex, it's OK!

01:24:27.790 --> 01:24:29.490
It's me, it's Julia!

01:24:29.490 --> 01:24:30.560
Alex, please!

01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:34.030
Stop it, Alex!

01:24:34.030 --> 01:24:35.030
It's Julia.

01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:36.730
Stop.

01:24:36.730 --> 01:24:38.500
Alex, what are you doing?

01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:40.500
Please, stop!

01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:41.500
Alex, stop!

01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:43.000
Alex, stop!

01:24:43.010 --> 01:24:44.070
Stop!

01:24:44.070 --> 01:24:45.070
No!

01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:49.080
No!

01:24:54.050 --> 01:24:55.050
No!

01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:03.990
No, stop it!

01:25:03.990 --> 01:25:04.890
No!

01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:07.600
Oh my god!

01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:09.600
Listen to me!

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:10.900
I love you!

01:25:10.900 --> 01:25:13.170
I love you, I'm your sister!

01:25:16.570 --> 01:25:18.640
Please stop!

01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:19.840
God!

01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:20.840
No!

01:25:24.410 --> 01:25:27.150
Please!

01:25:27.150 --> 01:25:28.780
No!

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:30.050
No, stop it!

01:25:36.990 --> 01:25:39.090
Alex, why are you doing this?

01:25:44.670 --> 01:25:46.100
Alex, please!

01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:48.040
Listen to me!

01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:50.210
Listen to me, I love you!

01:25:50.210 --> 01:25:52.170
Don't hurt me!

01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:54.110
Please, you're my sister!

01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:57.550
Vanida, stop.

01:26:03.690 --> 01:26:04.920
I know you're here.

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.960
You don't have to do this.

01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:14.730
I know they did horrible things
to you, but it wasn't us.

01:26:14.730 --> 01:26:15.900
Give me back my sister!

01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:18.770
They took everything from me!

01:26:18.770 --> 01:26:25.010
They took my life, they
took my blood, and for what?

01:26:25.010 --> 01:26:27.180
To give themselves luck?

01:26:27.180 --> 01:26:29.040
For someone else's life?

01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:38.750
You three came in here,
entitled, smug, arrogant.

01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:40.680
You have everything
I ever wanted.

01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:48.060
But you set me free.

01:26:48.070 --> 01:26:49.560
It wasn't us.

01:28:52.890 --> 01:28:53.790
Hey, babe.

01:28:53.790 --> 01:28:55.790
What's going on?

01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:57.730
I was just about to go to sleep.

01:28:57.730 --> 01:28:58.630
Alex?

01:28:58.630 --> 01:28:59.630
What's up?

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:02.900
Alex?

01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:04.230
You all right?

01:29:04.230 --> 01:29:06.330
What's going on?

01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:08.870
Something happened to Julia.

01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:10.830
You need to fly out
here right away.

01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:30.860
